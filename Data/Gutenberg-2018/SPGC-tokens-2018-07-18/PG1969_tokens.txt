the
story
of
catherine
which
appeared
in
fraser
magazine
in
was
written
by
thackeray
under
the
name
of
ikey
solomons
to
counteract
the
injurious
influence
of
some
popular
fictions
of
that
day
which
made
heroes
of
highwaymen
and
burglars
and
created
a
false
sympathy
for
the
vicious
and
criminal
with
this
purpose
the
author
chose
for
the
subject
of
his
story
a
woman
named
catherine
hayes
who
was
burned
at
tyburn
in
for
the
deliberate
murder
of
her
husband
under
very
revolting
circumstances
thackeray
aim
obviously
was
to
describe
the
career
of
this
wretched
woman
and
her
associates
with
such
fidelity
to
truth
as
to
exhibit
the
danger
and
folly
of
investing
such
persons
with
heroic
and
romantic
qualities
chapter
i
introducing
to
the
reader
the
chief
personages
of
this
narrative
at
that
famous
period
of
history
when
the
seventeenth
century
after
a
deal
of
quarrelling
reforming
republicanising
restoring
stuartising
and
orangising
to
be
sure
had
sunk
into
its
grave
giving
place
to
the
lusty
eighteenth
when
isaac
newton
was
a
tutor
of
trinity
and
joseph
addison
commissioner
of
appeals
when
the
presiding
genius
that
watched
over
the
destinies
of
the
french
nation
had
played
out
all
the
best
cards
in
his
hand
and
his
adversaries
began
to
pour
in
their
trumps
when
there
were
two
kings
in
spain
employed
perpetually
in
running
away
from
one
another
when
there
was
a
queen
in
england
with
such
rogues
for
ministers
as
have
never
been
seen
no
not
in
our
own
day
and
a
general
of
whom
it
may
be
severely
argued
whether
he
was
the
meanest
miser
or
the
greatest
hero
in
the
world
when
masham
had
not
yet
put
madam
marlborough
nose
out
of
joint
when
people
had
their
ears
cut
off
for
writing
very
meek
political
pamphlets
and
very
large
wigs
were
just
beginning
to
be
worn
with
powder
and
the
face
of
louis
the
great
as
his
was
handed
in
to
him
behind
the
was
when
issuing
thence
observed
to
look
longer
older
and
more
dismal
daily
about
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
five
that
is
in
the
glorious
reign
of
queen
anne
there
existed
certain
characters
and
befell
a
series
of
adventures
which
since
they
are
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
present
fashionable
style
and
taste
since
they
have
been
already
partly
described
in
the
newgate
calendar
since
they
are
as
shall
be
seen
anon
agreeably
low
delightfully
disgusting
and
at
the
same
time
eminently
pleasing
and
pathetic
may
properly
be
set
down
here
and
though
it
may
be
said
with
some
considerable
show
of
reason
that
agreeably
low
and
delightfully
disgusting
characters
have
already
been
treated
both
copiously
and
ably
by
some
eminent
writers
of
the
present
and
indeed
of
future
ages
though
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
the
immortal
fagin
requires
a
genius
of
inordinate
stride
and
to
go
after
the
late
though
deathless
turpin
the
renowned
jack
sheppard
or
the
embryo
duval
may
be
impossible
and
not
an
infringement
but
a
wasteful
indication
of
towards
the
eighth
commandment
though
it
may
on
the
one
hand
be
asserted
that
only
vain
coxcombs
would
dare
to
write
on
subjects
already
described
by
men
really
and
deservedly
eminent
on
the
other
hand
that
these
subjects
have
been
described
so
fully
that
nothing
more
can
be
said
about
them
on
the
third
hand
allowing
for
the
sake
of
argument
three
hands
to
one
figure
of
speech
that
the
public
has
heard
so
much
of
them
as
to
be
quite
tired
of
rogues
thieves
cutthroats
and
newgate
altogether
though
all
these
objections
may
be
urged
and
each
is
excellent
yet
we
intend
to
take
a
few
more
pages
from
the
old
bailey
calendar
to
bless
the
public
with
one
more
draught
from
the
stone
jug
yet
awhile
to
listen
and
riding
down
the
oxford
road
to
the
bland
conversation
of
jack
ketch
and
to
hang
with
him
round
the
neck
of
his
patient
at
the
end
of
our
and
his
history
we
give
the
reader
fair
notice
that
we
shall
tickle
him
with
a
few
such
scenes
of
villainy
and
bodily
suffering
in
general
as
are
not
to
be
found
no
not
in
never
mind
comparisons
for
such
are
odious
this
as
your
ladyship
is
aware
is
the
polite
name
for
her
majesty
prison
of
newgate
in
the
year
then
whether
it
was
that
the
queen
of
england
did
feel
seriously
alarmed
at
the
notion
that
a
french
prince
should
occupy
the
spanish
throne
or
whether
she
was
tenderly
attached
to
the
emperor
of
germany
or
whether
she
was
obliged
to
fight
out
the
quarrel
of
william
of
orange
who
made
us
pay
and
fight
for
his
dutch
provinces
or
whether
poor
old
louis
quatorze
did
really
frighten
her
or
whether
sarah
jennings
and
her
husband
wanted
to
make
a
fight
knowing
how
much
they
should
gain
by
it
whatever
the
reason
was
it
was
evident
that
the
war
was
to
continue
and
there
was
almost
as
much
soldiering
and
recruiting
parading
pike
and
and
military
enthusiasm
as
we
can
all
remember
in
the
year
what
time
the
corsican
upstart
menaced
our
shores
a
and
captain
of
cutts
regiment
which
had
been
so
mangled
at
blenheim
the
year
before
were
now
in
warwickshire
and
having
their
depot
at
warwick
the
captain
and
his
attendant
the
corporal
were
used
to
travel
through
the
country
seeking
for
heroes
to
fill
up
the
gaps
in
cutts
corps
and
for
adventures
to
pass
away
the
weary
time
of
a
country
life
our
captain
plume
and
sergeant
kite
it
was
at
this
time
by
the
way
that
those
famous
were
playing
their
pranks
in
shrewsbury
were
occupied
very
much
in
the
same
manner
with
heroes
they
roamed
from
warwick
to
stratford
and
from
stratford
to
birmingham
persuading
the
swains
of
warwickshire
to
leave
the
plough
for
the
pike
and
despatching
from
time
to
time
small
detachments
of
recruits
to
extend
marlborough
lines
and
to
act
as
food
for
the
hungry
cannon
at
ramillies
and
malplaquet
of
those
two
gentlemen
who
are
about
to
act
a
very
important
part
in
our
history
one
only
was
probably
a
native
of
britain
we
say
probably
because
the
individual
in
question
was
himself
quite
uncertain
and
it
must
be
added
entirely
indifferent
about
his
birthplace
but
speaking
the
english
language
and
having
been
during
the
course
of
his
life
pretty
generally
engaged
in
the
british
service
he
had
a
tolerably
fair
claim
to
the
majestic
title
of
briton
his
name
was
peter
brock
otherwise
corporal
brock
of
lord
cutts
regiment
of
dragoons
he
was
of
age
about
even
that
point
has
never
been
ascertained
in
height
about
five
feet
six
inches
in
weight
nearly
thirteen
stone
with
a
chest
that
the
celebrated
leitch
himself
might
envy
an
arm
that
was
like
an
leg
a
stomach
so
elastic
that
it
would
accommodate
itself
to
any
given
or
stolen
quantity
of
food
a
great
aptitude
for
strong
liquors
a
considerable
skill
in
singing
chansons
de
table
of
not
the
most
delicate
kind
he
was
a
lover
of
jokes
of
which
he
made
many
and
passably
bad
when
pleased
simply
coarse
boisterous
and
jovial
when
angry
a
perfect
demon
bullying
cursing
storming
fighting
as
is
sometimes
the
wont
with
gentlemen
of
his
cloth
and
education
brock
was
strictly
what
the
marquis
of
rodil
styled
himself
in
a
proclamation
to
his
soldiers
after
running
away
a
hijo
de
la
guerra
a
child
of
war
not
seven
cities
but
one
or
two
regiments
might
contend
for
the
honour
of
giving
him
birth
for
his
mother
whose
name
he
took
had
acted
as
to
a
royalist
regiment
had
then
obeyed
the
parliamentarians
died
in
scotland
when
monk
was
commanding
in
that
country
and
the
first
appearance
of
brock
in
a
public
capacity
displayed
him
as
a
fifer
in
the
general
own
regiment
of
coldstreamers
when
they
marched
from
scotland
to
london
and
from
a
republic
at
once
into
a
monarchy
since
that
period
brock
had
been
always
with
the
army
he
had
had
too
some
promotion
for
he
spake
of
having
a
command
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne
though
probably
as
he
never
mentioned
the
fact
upon
the
losing
side
the
very
year
before
this
narrative
commences
he
had
been
one
of
mordaunt
forlorn
hope
at
schellenberg
for
which
service
he
was
promised
a
pair
of
colours
he
lost
them
however
and
was
almost
shot
but
fate
did
not
ordain
that
his
career
should
close
in
that
way
for
drunkenness
and
insubordination
immediately
after
the
battle
but
having
in
some
measure
reinstated
himself
by
a
display
of
much
gallantry
at
blenheim
it
was
found
advisable
to
send
him
to
england
for
the
purposes
of
recruiting
and
remove
him
altogether
from
the
regiment
where
his
gallantry
only
rendered
the
example
of
his
riot
more
dangerous
brock
commander
was
a
slim
young
gentleman
of
about
whom
there
was
likewise
a
history
if
one
would
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
he
was
a
bavarian
by
birth
his
mother
being
an
english
lady
and
enjoyed
along
with
a
dozen
other
brothers
the
title
of
count
eleven
of
these
of
course
were
penniless
one
or
two
were
priests
one
a
monk
six
or
seven
in
various
military
services
and
the
elder
at
home
at
schloss
galgenstein
breeding
horses
hunting
wild
boars
swindling
tenants
living
in
a
great
house
with
small
means
obliged
to
be
sordid
at
home
all
the
year
to
be
splendid
for
a
month
at
the
capital
as
is
the
way
with
many
other
noblemen
our
young
count
count
gustavus
adolphus
maximilian
von
galgenstein
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
french
as
page
to
a
nobleman
then
of
his
majesty
gardes
du
corps
then
a
lieutenant
and
captain
in
the
bavarian
service
and
when
after
the
battle
of
blenheim
two
regiments
of
germans
came
over
to
the
winning
side
gustavus
adolphus
maximilian
found
himself
among
them
and
at
the
epoch
when
this
story
commences
had
enjoyed
english
pay
for
a
year
or
more
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
how
he
exchanged
into
his
present
regiment
how
it
appeared
that
before
her
marriage
handsome
john
churchill
had
known
the
young
gentleman
mother
when
they
were
both
penniless
at
charles
the
second
court
it
is
we
say
quite
useless
to
repeat
all
the
scandal
of
which
we
are
perfectly
masters
and
to
trace
step
by
step
the
events
of
his
history
here
however
was
gustavus
adolphus
in
a
small
inn
in
a
small
village
of
warwickshire
on
an
autumn
evening
in
the
year
and
at
the
very
moment
when
this
history
begins
he
and
brock
his
corporal
and
friend
were
seated
at
a
round
table
before
the
while
a
small
groom
of
the
establishment
was
leading
up
and
down
on
the
village
green
before
the
inn
door
two
black
glossy
flanders
horses
which
were
the
property
of
the
two
gentlemen
now
taking
their
ease
at
the
bugle
the
two
gentlemen
were
seated
at
their
ease
at
the
inn
table
drinking
and
if
the
reader
fancies
from
the
sketch
which
we
have
given
of
their
lives
or
from
his
own
blindness
and
belief
in
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
that
the
sun
of
that
autumn
evening
shone
upon
any
two
men
in
county
or
city
at
desk
or
harvest
at
court
or
at
newgate
drunk
or
sober
who
were
greater
rascals
than
count
gustavus
galgenstein
and
corporal
peter
brock
he
is
egregiously
mistaken
and
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
not
worth
a
fig
if
they
had
not
been
two
prominent
scoundrels
what
earthly
business
should
we
have
in
detailing
their
histories
what
would
the
public
care
for
them
who
would
meddle
with
dull
virtue
humdrum
sentiment
or
stupid
innocence
when
vice
agreeable
vice
is
the
only
thing
which
the
readers
of
romances
care
to
hear
the
little
who
was
leading
the
two
black
flanders
horses
up
and
down
the
green
might
have
put
them
in
the
stable
for
any
good
that
the
horses
got
by
the
gentle
exercise
which
they
were
now
taking
in
the
cool
evening
air
as
their
owners
had
not
ridden
very
far
or
very
hard
and
there
was
not
a
hair
turned
of
their
sleek
shining
coats
but
the
lad
had
been
especially
ordered
so
to
walk
the
horses
about
until
he
received
further
commands
from
the
gentlemen
reposing
in
the
bugle
kitchen
and
the
idlers
of
the
village
seemed
so
pleased
with
the
beasts
and
their
smart
saddles
and
shining
bridles
that
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
deprive
them
of
the
pleasure
of
contemplating
such
an
innocent
spectacle
over
the
count
horse
was
thrown
a
fine
red
cloth
richly
embroidered
in
yellow
worsted
a
very
large
count
coronet
and
a
cipher
at
the
four
corners
of
the
covering
and
under
this
might
be
seen
a
pair
of
gorgeous
silver
stirrups
and
above
it
a
couple
of
pistols
reposing
in
bearskin
holsters
the
bit
was
silver
too
and
the
horse
head
was
decorated
with
many
smart
ribbons
of
the
corporal
steed
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
ornaments
were
in
brass
as
bright
though
not
perhaps
so
valuable
as
those
which
decorated
the
captain
animal
the
boys
who
had
been
at
play
on
the
green
first
paused
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
then
the
village
matrons
followed
and
afterwards
sauntering
by
ones
and
twos
came
the
village
maidens
who
love
soldiers
as
flies
love
treacle
presently
the
males
began
to
arrive
and
lo
the
parson
of
the
parish
taking
his
evening
walk
with
dobbs
and
the
four
children
his
offspring
at
length
joined
himself
to
his
flock
to
this
audience
the
little
ostler
explained
that
the
animals
belonged
to
two
gentlemen
now
reposing
at
the
bugle
one
young
with
gold
hair
the
other
old
with
grizzled
locks
both
in
red
coats
both
in
putting
the
house
into
a
bustle
and
calling
for
the
best
he
then
discoursed
to
some
of
his
own
companions
regarding
the
merits
of
the
horses
and
the
parson
a
learned
man
explained
to
the
villagers
that
one
of
the
travellers
must
be
a
count
or
at
least
had
a
horsecloth
pronounced
that
the
stirrups
were
of
real
silver
and
checked
the
impetuosity
of
his
son
william
nassau
dobbs
who
was
for
mounting
the
animals
and
who
expressed
a
longing
to
fire
off
one
of
the
pistols
in
the
holsters
as
this
family
discussion
was
taking
place
the
gentlemen
whose
appearance
had
created
so
much
attention
came
to
the
door
of
the
inn
and
the
elder
and
stouter
was
seen
to
smile
at
his
companion
after
which
he
strolled
leisurely
over
the
green
and
seemed
to
examine
with
much
benevolent
satisfaction
the
assemblage
of
villagers
who
were
staring
at
him
and
the
quadrupeds
brock
when
he
saw
the
parson
band
and
cassock
took
off
his
beaver
reverently
and
saluted
the
divine
i
hope
your
reverence
baulk
the
little
fellow
said
he
i
think
i
heard
him
calling
out
for
a
ride
and
whether
he
should
like
my
horse
or
his
lordship
horse
i
am
sure
it
is
all
one
do
be
afraid
sir
the
horses
are
not
tired
we
have
only
come
seventy
mile
and
prince
eugene
once
rode
a
matter
of
leagues
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
sir
upon
that
horse
between
sunrise
and
gracious
powers
on
which
horse
said
doctor
dobbs
very
solemnly
on
this
sir
on
mine
corporal
brock
of
cutts
black
gelding
of
nassau
the
prince
sir
gave
it
me
after
blenheim
fight
for
i
had
my
own
legs
carried
away
by
a
just
as
i
cut
down
two
of
sauerkrauter
regiment
who
had
made
the
prince
your
own
legs
sir
said
the
doctor
gracious
goodness
this
is
more
and
more
astonishing
no
no
not
my
own
legs
my
horse
i
mean
sir
and
the
prince
gave
me
of
nassau
that
very
to
this
no
direct
reply
was
made
but
the
doctor
looked
at
dobbs
and
dobbs
and
the
rest
of
the
children
at
her
eldest
son
who
grinned
and
said
is
it
wonderful
the
corporal
to
this
answered
nothing
but
resuming
his
account
pointed
to
the
other
horse
and
said
that
horse
sir
good
as
mine
is
that
horse
with
the
silver
stirrups
is
his
excellency
horse
captain
count
maximilian
gustavus
adolphus
von
galgenstein
captain
of
horse
and
of
the
holy
roman
empire
he
lifted
here
his
hat
with
much
gravity
and
all
the
crowd
even
to
the
parson
did
likewise
we
call
him
of
denmark
sir
in
compliment
to
her
majesty
husband
he
is
blenheim
too
sir
marshal
tallard
rode
him
on
that
day
and
you
know
how
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
george
of
denmark
marshal
tallard
william
of
nassau
this
is
strange
indeed
most
wonderful
why
sir
little
are
you
aware
that
there
are
before
you
at
this
moment
two
other
living
beings
who
bear
these
venerated
names
my
boys
stand
forward
look
here
sir
these
children
have
been
respectively
named
after
our
late
sovereign
and
the
husband
of
our
present
and
very
good
names
too
sir
ay
and
very
noble
little
fellows
too
and
i
propose
that
with
your
reverence
and
your
ladyship
leave
william
nassau
here
shall
ride
on
george
of
denmark
and
george
of
denmark
shall
ride
on
william
of
when
this
speech
of
the
corporal
was
made
the
whole
crowd
set
up
a
loyal
hurrah
and
with
much
gravity
the
two
little
boys
were
lifted
up
into
the
saddles
and
the
corporal
leading
one
entrusted
the
other
to
the
and
so
together
marched
stately
up
and
down
the
green
the
popularity
which
brock
gained
by
this
manoeuvre
was
very
great
but
with
regard
to
the
names
of
the
horses
and
children
which
coincided
so
extraordinarily
it
is
but
fair
to
state
that
the
christening
of
the
quadrupeds
had
only
taken
place
about
two
minutes
before
the
appearance
on
the
green
for
if
the
fact
must
be
confessed
he
while
seated
near
the
inn
window
had
kept
a
pretty
wistful
eye
upon
all
going
on
without
and
the
horses
marching
thus
to
and
fro
for
the
wonderment
of
the
village
were
only
placards
or
advertisements
for
the
riders
there
was
besides
the
boy
now
occupied
with
the
horses
and
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
bugle
inn
another
person
connected
with
that
establishment
a
very
smart
handsome
vain
giggling
about
the
age
of
sixteen
who
went
by
the
familiar
name
of
cat
and
attended
upon
the
gentlemen
in
the
parlour
while
the
landlady
was
employed
in
cooking
their
supper
in
the
kitchen
this
young
person
had
been
educated
in
the
village
and
having
been
pronounced
by
doctor
dobbs
and
the
schoolmaster
the
idlest
dirtiest
and
most
passionate
little
minx
with
whom
either
had
ever
had
to
do
she
was
after
receiving
a
very
small
portion
of
literary
instruction
indeed
it
must
be
stated
that
the
young
lady
did
not
know
her
letters
bound
apprentice
at
the
age
of
nine
years
to
mrs
score
her
relative
and
landlady
of
the
bugle
if
miss
cat
or
catherine
hall
was
a
slattern
and
a
minx
mrs
score
was
a
far
superior
shrew
and
for
the
seven
years
of
her
apprenticeship
the
girl
was
completely
at
her
mistress
mercy
yet
though
wondrously
stingy
jealous
and
violent
while
her
maid
was
idle
and
extravagant
and
her
husband
seemed
to
abet
the
girl
mrs
score
put
up
with
the
wench
airs
idleness
and
caprices
without
ever
wishing
to
dismiss
her
from
the
the
fact
is
that
miss
catherine
was
a
great
beauty
and
for
about
two
years
since
her
fame
had
begun
to
spread
the
custom
of
the
inn
had
also
increased
vastly
when
there
was
a
debate
whether
the
farmers
on
their
way
from
market
would
take
pot
catherine
by
appearing
with
it
would
straightway
cause
the
liquor
to
be
swallowed
and
paid
for
and
when
the
traveller
who
proposed
riding
that
night
and
sleeping
at
coventry
or
birmingham
was
asked
by
miss
catherine
whether
he
would
like
a
fire
in
his
bedroom
he
generally
was
induced
to
occupy
it
although
he
might
before
have
vowed
to
mrs
score
that
he
would
not
for
a
thousand
guineas
be
absent
from
home
that
night
the
girl
had
too
lovers
in
the
village
and
these
were
bound
in
honour
to
spend
their
pence
at
the
alehouse
she
inhabited
o
woman
lovely
woman
what
strong
resolves
canst
thou
twist
round
thy
little
finger
what
gunpowder
passions
canst
thou
kindle
with
a
single
sparkle
of
thine
eye
what
lies
and
fribble
nonsense
canst
thou
make
us
listen
to
as
they
were
gospel
truth
or
splendid
wit
above
all
what
bad
liquor
canst
thou
make
us
swallow
when
thou
puttest
a
kiss
within
the
cup
and
we
are
content
to
call
the
poison
wine
the
at
the
bugle
was
in
fact
execrable
but
cat
who
served
it
to
the
two
soldiers
made
it
so
agreeable
to
them
that
they
found
it
a
passable
even
a
pleasant
task
to
swallow
the
contents
of
a
second
bottle
the
miracle
had
been
wrought
instantaneously
on
her
appearance
for
whereas
at
that
very
moment
the
count
was
employed
in
cursing
the
wine
the
landlady
the
and
the
english
nation
generally
when
the
young
woman
entered
and
choosing
so
to
interpret
the
oaths
said
coming
your
honour
i
think
your
honour
called
gustavus
adolphus
whistled
stared
at
her
very
hard
and
seeming
quite
by
her
appearance
contented
himself
by
swallowing
a
whole
glass
of
mountain
by
way
of
reply
brock
was
however
by
no
means
so
confounded
as
his
captain
he
was
thirty
years
older
than
the
latter
and
in
the
course
of
fifty
years
of
military
life
had
learned
to
look
on
the
most
dangerous
enemy
or
the
most
beautiful
woman
with
the
like
daring
determination
to
conquer
my
dear
mary
then
said
that
gentleman
his
honour
is
a
lord
as
good
as
a
lord
that
is
for
all
he
allows
such
humble
fellows
as
i
am
to
drink
with
catherine
dropped
a
low
curtsey
and
said
well
i
do
know
if
you
are
joking
a
poor
country
girl
as
all
you
soldier
gentlemen
do
but
his
honour
looks
like
a
lord
though
i
never
see
one
to
be
then
said
the
captain
gathering
courage
how
do
you
know
i
look
like
one
pretty
mary
pretty
catherine
i
mean
catherine
if
you
please
here
brock
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
shouting
with
many
oaths
that
she
was
right
at
first
invited
her
to
give
him
what
he
called
a
buss
pretty
catherine
turned
away
from
him
at
this
request
and
muttered
something
about
keep
your
distance
low
fellow
buss
indeed
poor
country
girl
etc
placing
herself
as
if
for
protection
on
the
side
of
the
captain
that
gentleman
looked
also
very
angry
but
whether
at
the
sight
of
innocence
so
outraged
or
the
insolence
of
the
corporal
for
daring
to
help
himself
first
we
can
not
say
hark
ye
brock
he
cried
very
fiercely
i
will
suffer
no
such
liberties
in
my
presence
remember
it
is
only
my
condescension
which
permits
you
to
share
my
bottle
in
this
way
take
care
i
do
give
you
instead
a
taste
of
my
so
saying
he
in
a
protecting
manner
placed
one
hand
round
catherine
waist
holding
the
other
clenched
very
near
to
the
corporal
nose
catherine
for
her
share
of
this
action
of
the
count
dropped
another
curtsey
and
said
thank
you
my
but
galgenstein
threat
did
not
appear
to
make
any
impression
on
brock
as
indeed
there
was
no
reason
that
it
should
for
the
corporal
at
a
combat
of
fisticuffs
could
have
pounded
his
commander
into
a
jelly
in
ten
minutes
so
he
contented
himself
by
saying
well
noble
captain
there
no
harm
done
it
is
an
honour
for
poor
old
peter
brock
to
be
at
table
with
you
and
i
am
sorry
sure
in
truth
peter
i
believe
thou
art
thou
hast
good
reason
eh
peter
but
never
fear
man
had
i
struck
thee
i
never
would
have
hurt
i
know
you
would
not
replied
brock
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
with
much
gravity
and
so
peace
was
made
and
healths
were
drunk
miss
catherine
condescended
to
put
her
lips
to
the
captain
glass
who
swore
that
the
wine
was
thus
converted
into
nectar
and
although
the
girl
had
not
previously
heard
of
that
liquor
she
received
the
compliment
as
a
compliment
and
smiled
and
simpered
in
return
the
poor
thing
had
never
before
seen
anybody
so
handsome
or
so
finely
dressed
as
the
count
and
in
the
simplicity
of
her
coquetry
allowed
her
satisfaction
to
be
quite
visible
nothing
could
be
more
clumsy
than
the
gentleman
mode
of
complimenting
her
but
for
this
perhaps
his
speeches
were
more
effective
than
others
more
delicate
would
have
been
and
though
she
said
to
each
oh
now
my
lord
and
la
captain
how
can
you
flatter
one
so
and
your
honour
laughing
at
me
and
made
such
polite
speeches
as
are
used
on
these
occasions
it
was
manifest
from
the
flutter
and
blush
and
the
grin
of
satisfaction
which
lighted
up
the
buxom
features
of
the
little
country
beauty
that
the
first
operations
had
been
highly
successful
when
following
up
his
attack
he
produced
from
his
neck
a
small
locket
which
had
been
given
him
by
a
dutch
lady
at
the
brill
and
begged
miss
catherine
to
wear
it
for
his
sake
and
chucked
her
under
the
chin
and
called
her
his
little
rosebud
it
was
pretty
clear
how
things
would
go
anybody
who
could
see
the
expression
of
brock
countenance
at
this
event
might
judge
of
the
progress
of
the
irresistible
conqueror
being
of
a
very
vain
communicative
turn
our
fair
barmaid
gave
her
two
companions
not
only
a
pretty
long
account
of
herself
but
of
many
other
persons
in
the
village
whom
she
could
perceive
from
the
window
opposite
to
which
she
stood
yes
your
honour
said
she
my
lord
i
mean
sixteen
last
march
though
there
a
many
girl
in
the
village
that
at
my
age
is
quite
chits
there
polly
randall
now
that
girl
along
with
thomas
curtis
she
seventeen
if
she
a
day
though
he
is
the
very
first
sweetheart
she
has
had
well
as
i
am
saying
i
was
bred
up
here
in
the
village
father
and
mother
died
very
young
and
i
was
left
a
poor
orphan
well
bless
us
if
thomas
have
kissed
her
to
the
care
of
mrs
score
my
aunt
who
has
been
a
mother
to
me
a
stepmother
you
know
and
i
been
to
stratford
fair
and
to
warwick
many
a
time
and
there
two
people
who
have
offered
to
marry
me
and
ever
so
many
who
want
to
and
i
wo
have
none
only
a
gentleman
as
i
always
said
not
a
poor
clodpole
like
tom
there
with
the
red
waistcoat
he
was
one
that
asked
me
nor
a
drunken
fellow
like
sam
blacksmith
yonder
him
whose
wife
has
got
the
black
eye
but
a
real
gentleman
like
like
whom
my
dear
said
the
captain
encouraged
la
sir
how
can
you
why
like
our
squire
sir
john
who
rides
in
such
a
mortal
fine
gold
coach
or
at
least
like
the
parson
doctor
dobbs
that
he
in
the
black
gown
walking
with
madam
dobbs
in
and
are
those
his
children
yes
two
girls
and
two
boys
and
only
think
he
calls
one
william
nassau
and
one
george
denmark
is
it
odd
and
from
the
parson
catherine
went
on
to
speak
of
several
humble
personages
of
the
village
community
who
as
they
are
not
necessary
to
our
story
need
not
be
described
at
full
length
it
was
when
from
the
window
corporal
brock
saw
the
altercation
between
the
worthy
divine
and
his
son
respecting
the
latter
ride
that
he
judged
it
a
fitting
time
to
step
out
on
the
green
and
to
bestow
on
the
two
horses
those
famous
historical
names
which
we
have
just
heard
applied
to
them
brock
diplomacy
was
as
we
have
stated
quite
successful
for
when
the
parson
boys
had
ridden
and
retired
along
with
their
mamma
and
papa
other
young
gentlemen
of
humbler
rank
in
the
village
were
placed
upon
george
of
denmark
and
william
of
nassau
the
corporal
joking
and
laughing
with
all
the
people
the
women
in
spite
of
brock
age
his
red
nose
and
a
certain
squint
of
his
eye
vowed
the
corporal
was
a
jewel
of
a
man
and
among
the
men
his
popularity
was
equally
great
how
much
dost
thee
get
thomas
clodpole
said
brock
to
a
countryman
he
was
the
man
whom
catherine
had
described
as
her
suitor
who
had
laughed
loudest
at
some
of
his
jokes
how
much
dost
thee
get
for
a
week
work
now
clodpole
whose
name
was
really
bullock
stated
that
his
wages
amounted
to
three
shillings
and
a
three
shillings
and
a
puddn
monstrous
and
for
this
you
toil
like
a
as
i
have
seen
them
in
turkey
and
america
ay
gentlemen
and
in
the
country
of
prester
john
you
shiver
out
of
bed
on
icy
winter
mornings
to
break
the
ice
for
ball
and
dapple
to
yes
indeed
said
the
person
addressed
who
seemed
astounded
at
the
extent
of
the
corporal
information
or
you
clean
pigsty
and
take
dung
down
to
meadow
or
you
act
watchdog
and
tend
sheep
or
you
sweep
a
scythe
over
a
great
field
of
grass
and
when
the
sun
has
scorched
the
eyes
out
of
your
head
and
sweated
the
flesh
off
your
bones
and
fried
the
soul
out
of
your
body
you
go
home
to
what
three
shillings
a
week
and
a
puddn
do
you
get
pudding
every
day

only
do
you
get

by
serving
her
sacred
majesty
to
be
sure
long
life
to
her
and
down
with
the
french
king
bullock
a
few
of
the
men
and
two
or
three
of
the
boys
piped
out
an
hurrah
in
compliment
to
this
speech
of
the
corporal
but
it
was
remarked
that
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
drew
back
the
women
whispering
ominously
to
them
and
looking
at
the
corporal
i
see
ladies

him
i
have
money
look
you
and
like
to
spend
it
what
should
be
doing
dirty
actions
for
hay
tummas
a
satisfactory
reply
to
this
query
was
not
of
course
expected
by
the
corporal
nor
uttered
by
bullock
and
the
end
of
the
dispute
was
that
he
and
three
or
four
of
the
rustic
bystanders
were
quite
convinced
of
the
good
intentions
of
their
new
friend
and
accompanied
him
back
to
the
bugle
to
regale
upon
the
promised
beer
among
the
guests
was
one
young
fellow
whose
dress
would
show
that
he
was
somewhat
better
to
do
in
the
world
than
clodpole
and
the
rest
of
the
sunburnt
ragged
troop
who
were
marching
towards
the
alehouse
this
man
was
the
only
one
of
his
hearers
who
perhaps
was
sceptical
as
to
the
truth
of
his
stories
but
as
soon
as
bullock
accepted
the
invitation
to
drink
john
hayes
the
carpenter
for
such
was
his
name
and
profession
said
well
thomas
if
thou
goest
i
will
go
i
know
thee
wilt
said
thomas
goo
anywhere
catty
hall
is
provided
thou
canst
goo
for
nay
i
have
a
penny
to
spend
as
good
as
the
corporal
a
penny
to
keep
you
mean
for
all
your
love
for
the
lass
at
the
did
thee
ever
spend
a
shilling
in
the
house
thee
would
go
now
but
that
i
am
going
too
and
the
captain
here
stands
come
come
gentlemen
no
quarrelling
said
brock
if
this
pretty
fellow
will
join
us
amen
say
i
there
lots
of
liquor
and
plenty
of
money
to
pay
the
score
comrade
tummas

hayes

a
hearty
cock
i
make
no
doubt
and
all
such
are
welcome
come
along
my
gentleman
farmers
brock
shall
have
the
honour
to
pay
for
you
and
with
this
corporal
brock
accompanied
by
hayes
bullock
blacksmith
butcher
and
one
or
two
others
adjourned
to
the
inn
the
horses
being
at
the
same
time
conducted
to
the
stable
although
we
have
in
this
quiet
way
and
without
any
flourishing
of
trumpets
or
beginning
of
chapters
introduced
hayes
to
the
public
and
although
at
first
sight
a
sneaking
carpenter
boy
may
seem
hardly
worthy
of
the
notice
of
an
intelligent
reader
who
looks
for
a
good
or
highwayman
for
a
hero
or
a
pickpocket
at
the
very
least
this
gentleman
words
and
actions
should
be
carefully
studied
by
the
public
as
he
is
destined
to
appear
before
them
under
very
polite
and
curious
circumstances
during
the
course
of
this
history
the
speech
of
the
rustic
juvenal
clodpole
had
seemed
to
infer
that
hayes
was
at
once
careful
of
his
money
and
a
warm
admirer
of
catherine
of
the
bugle
and
both
the
charges
were
perfectly
true
hayes
father
was
reported
to
be
a
man
of
some
substance
and
young
john
who
was
performing
his
apprenticeship
in
the
village
did
not
fail
to
talk
very
big
of
his
pretensions
to
fortune
of
his
entering
at
the
close
of
his
indentures
into
partnership
with
his
father
and
of
the
comfortable
farm
and
house
over
which
john
hayes
whoever
she
might
be
would
one
day
preside
thus
next
to
the
barber
and
butcher
and
above
even
his
own
master
hayes
took
rank
in
the
village
and
it
must
not
be
concealed
that
his
representation
of
wealth
had
made
some
impression
upon
hall
toward
whom
the
young
gentleman
had
cast
the
eyes
of
affection
if
he
had
been
tolerably
and
not
pale
rickety
and
feeble
as
he
was
if
even
he
had
been
ugly
but
withal
a
man
of
spirit
it
is
probable
the
girl
kindness
for
him
would
have
been
much
more
decided
but
he
was
a
poor
weak
creature
not
to
compare
with
honest
thomas
bullock
by
at
least
nine
inches
and
so
notoriously
timid
selfish
and
stingy
that
there
was
a
kind
of
shame
in
receiving
his
addresses
openly
and
what
encouragement
catherine
gave
him
could
only
be
in
secret
but
no
mortal
is
wise
at
all
times
and
the
fact
was
that
hayes
who
cared
for
himself
intensely
had
set
his
heart
upon
winning
catherine
and
loved
her
with
a
desperate
greedy
eagerness
and
desire
of
possession
which
makes
passions
for
women
often
so
fierce
and
unreasonable
among
very
cold
and
selfish
men
his
parents
whose
frugality
he
had
inherited
had
tried
in
vain
to
wean
him
from
this
passion
and
had
made
many
fruitless
attempts
to
engage
him
with
women
who
possessed
money
and
desired
husbands
but
hayes
was
for
a
wonder
quite
proof
against
their
attractions
and
though
quite
ready
to
acknowledge
the
absurdity
of
his
love
for
a
penniless
alehouse
nevertheless
persisted
in
it
doggedly
i
know
i
a
fool
said
he
and
what
more
the
girl
does
not
care
for
me
but
marry
her
i
must
or
i
think
i
shall
just
die
and
marry
her
i
for
very
much
to
the
credit
of
miss
catherine
modesty
she
had
declared
that
marriage
was
with
her
a
sine
qua
non
and
had
dismissed
with
the
loudest
scorn
and
indignation
all
propositions
of
a
less
proper
nature
poor
thomas
bullock
was
another
of
her
admirers
and
had
offered
to
marry
her
but
three
shillings
a
week
and
a
puddn
was
not
to
the
taste
and
thomas
had
been
scornfully
rejected
hayes
had
also
made
her
a
direct
proposal
catherine
did
not
say
no
she
was
too
prudent
but
she
was
young
and
could
wait
she
did
not
care
for
hayes
yet
enough
to
marry
him
it
did
not
seem
indeed
in
the
young
woman
nature
to
care
for
anybody
and
she
gave
her
adorer
flatteringly
to
understand
that
if
nobody
better
appeared
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
she
might
be
induced
to
become
hayes
it
was
a
dismal
prospect
for
the
poor
fellow
to
live
upon
the
hope
of
being
one
day
in
the
meantime
she
considered
herself
free
as
the
wind
and
permitted
herself
all
the
innocent
gaieties
which
that
chartered
libertine
a
coquette
can
take
she
flirted
with
all
the
bachelors
widowers
and
married
men
in
a
manner
which
did
extraordinary
credit
to
her
years
and
let
not
the
reader
fancy
such
pastimes
unnatural
at
her
early
age
the
ladies
heaven
bless
them
are
as
a
general
rule
coquettes
from
babyhood
upwards
little
she
of
three
years
old
play
little
airs
and
graces
upon
small
heroes
of
five
simpering
misses
of
nine
make
attacks
upon
young
gentlemen
of
twelve
and
at
sixteen
a
girl
under
encouraging
circumstances
say
she
is
pretty
in
a
family
of
ugly
elder
sisters
or
an
only
child
and
heiress
or
a
humble
wench
at
a
country
inn
like
our
fair
catherine
is
at
the
very
pink
and
prime
of
her
coquetry
they
will
jilt
you
at
that
age
with
an
ease
and
arch
infantine
simplicity
that
never
can
be
surpassed
in
maturer
years
miss
catherine
then
was
a
franche
coquette
and
john
hayes
was
miserable
his
life
was
passed
in
a
storm
of
mean
passions
and
bitter
jealousies
and
desperate
attacks
upon
the
of
catherine
heart
which
not
all
his
tempest
of
love
could
beat
down
o
cruel
cruel
pangs
of
love
unrequited
mean
rogues
feel
them
as
well
as
great
heroes
lives
there
the
man
in
europe
who
has
not
felt
them
many
times
who
has
not
knelt
and
fawned
and
supplicated
and
wept
and
cursed
and
raved
all
in
vain
and
passed
long
wakeful
nights
with
ghosts
of
dead
hopes
for
company
shadows
of
buried
remembrances
that
glide
out
of
their
graves
of
nights
and
whisper
we
are
dead
now
but
we
were
once
and
we
made
you
happy
and
we
come
now
to
mock
you
despair
o
lover
despair
and
die
o
cruel
pangs
dismal
nights
now
a
sly
demon
creeps
under
your
nightcap
and
drops
into
your
ear
those
soft
sweet
words
uttered
on
the
evening
there
in
the
drawer
of
your
along
with
the
razors
and
macassar
oil
lies
the
dead
flower
that
lady
amelia
wilhelmina
wore
in
her
bosom
on
the
night
of
a
certain
ball
the
corpse
of
a
glorious
hope
that
seemed
once
as
if
it
would
live
for
ever
so
strong
was
it
so
full
of
joy
and
sunshine
there
in
your
among
a
crowd
of
unpaid
bills
is
the
dirty
scrap
of
paper
which
came
in
company
with
a
pair
of
muffetees
of
her
knitting
she
was
a
butcher
daughter
and
did
all
she
could
poor
thing
begging
you
would
ware
them
at
collidge
and
think
of
her
who
married
a
three
weeks
afterwards
and
cares
for
you
no
more
now
than
she
does
for
the
but
why
multiply
instances
or
seek
to
depict
the
agony
of
poor
john
hayes
no
mistake
can
be
greater
than
that
of
fancying
such
great
emotions
of
love
are
only
felt
by
virtuous
or
exalted
men
depend
upon
it
love
like
death
plays
havoc
among
the
pauperum
tabernas
and
sports
with
rich
and
poor
wicked
and
virtuous
alike
i
have
often
fancied
for
instance
on
seeing
the
haggard
pale
young
who
wakes
the
echoes
of
our
street
with
his
nasal
cry
of
clo
i
have
often
i
said
fancied
that
besides
the
load
of
exuvial
coats
and
breeches
under
which
he
staggers
there
is
another
weight
on
him
an
atrior
cura
at
his
tail
and
while
his
unshorn
lips
and
nose
together
are
performing
that
mocking
boisterous
cry
of
clo
clo
who
knows
what
woeful
utterances
are
crying
from
the
heart
within
there
he
is
chaffering
with
the
footman
at
no
about
an
old
you
think
his
whole
soul
is
bent
only
on
the
contest
about
the
garment
psha
there
is
perhaps
some
faithless
girl
in
holywell
street
who
fills
up
his
heart
and
that
desultory
is
a
peripatetic
hell
take
another
instance
take
the
man
in
the
in
saint
court
there
he
is
to
all
appearances
quite
calm
before
the
same
round
of
beef
from
morning
till
sundown
for
hundreds
of
years
very
likely
perhaps
when
the
shutters
are
closed
and
all
the
world
tired
and
silent
there
is
he
silent
but
untired
cutting
cutting
cutting
you
enter
you
get
your
meat
to
your
liking
you
depart
and
quite
unmoved
on
on
he
goes
reaping
ceaselessly
the
great
harvest
of
beef
you
would
fancy
that
if
passion
ever
failed
to
conquer
it
had
in
vain
assailed
the
calm
bosom
of
that
man
i
doubt
it
and
would
give
much
to
know
his
history
who
knows
what
furious
are
raging
underneath
the
surface
of
that
calm
who
can
tell
me
that
that
calmness
itself
is
not
despair
the
reader
if
he
does
not
now
understand
why
it
was
that
hayes
agreed
to
drink
the
corporal
proffered
beer
had
better
just
read
the
foregoing
remarks
over
again
and
if
he
does
not
understand
then
why
small
praise
to
his
brains
hayes
could
not
bear
that
bullock
should
have
a
chance
of
seeing
and
perhaps
making
love
to
catherine
in
his
absence
and
though
the
young
woman
never
diminished
her
coquetries
but
on
the
contrary
rather
increased
them
in
his
presence
it
was
still
a
kind
of
dismal
satisfaction
to
be
miserable
in
her
company
on
this
occasion
the
disconsolate
lover
could
be
wretched
to
his
heart
content
for
catherine
had
not
a
word
or
a
look
for
him
but
bestowed
all
her
smiles
upon
the
handsome
stranger
who
owned
the
black
horse
as
for
poor
tummas
bullock
his
passion
was
never
violent
and
he
was
content
in
the
present
instance
to
sigh
and
drink
beer
he
sighed
and
drank
sighed
and
drank
and
drank
again
until
he
had
swallowed
so
much
of
the
corporal
liquor
as
to
be
induced
to
accept
a
guinea
from
his
purse
also
and
found
himself
on
returning
to
reason
and
sobriety
a
soldier
of
queen
anne
but
oh
fancy
the
agonies
of
hayes
when
seated
with
the
friends
at
one
end
of
the
kitchen
he
saw
the
captain
at
the
place
of
honour
and
the
smiles
which
the
fair
maid
bestowed
upon
him
when
as
she
lightly
whisked
past
him
with
the
captain
supper
she
pointing
to
the
locket
that
once
reposed
on
the
breast
of
the
dutch
lady
at
the
brill
looked
archly
on
hayes
and
said
see
john
what
his
lordship
has
given
me
and
when
john
face
became
green
and
purple
with
rage
and
jealousy
catherine
laughed
ten
times
louder
and
cried
coming
my
lord
in
a
voice
of
shrill
triumph
that
bored
through
the
soul
of
john
hayes
and
left
him
gasping
for
breath
on
catherine
other
lover
thomas
this
coquetry
had
no
effect
he
and
two
comrades
of
his
had
by
this
time
quite
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
corporal
and
hope
glory
strong
beer
prince
eugene
pair
of
colours
more
strong
beer
her
blessed
majesty
plenty
more
strong
beer
and
such
subjects
martial
and
bacchic
whirled
through
their
dizzy
brains
at
a
railroad
pace
and
now
if
there
had
been
a
couple
of
experienced
reporters
present
at
the
bugle
inn
they
might
have
taken
down
a
conversation
on
love
and
war
the
two
themes
discussed
by
the
two
parties
occupying
the
kitchen
which
as
the
parts
were
sung
together
duetwise
formed
together
some
very
curious
harmonies
thus
while
the
captain
was
whispering
the
softest
nothings
the
corporal
was
shouting
the
fiercest
combats
of
the
war
and
like
the
gentleman
at
penelope
table
on
it
exiguo
pinxit
praelia
tota
bero
for
example
captain
what
do
you
say
to
a
silver
trimming
pretty
catherine
you
think
a
scarlet
handsomely
laced
would
become
you
wonderfully
well
and
a
grey
hat
with
a
blue
feather
and
a
pretty
nag
to
ride
on
and
all
the
soldiers
to
present
arms
as
you
pass
and
say
there
goes
the
captain
lady
what
do
you
think
of
a
at
lincoln
inn
playhouse
or
of
standing
up
to
a
minuet
with
my
lord
marquis
at
corporal
the
ball
sir
ran
right
up
his
elbow
and
was
found
the
next
day
by
surgeon
splinter
of
ours
where
do
you
think
sir
upon
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
it
came
out
of
the
nape
of
his
captain
necklace
and
a
sweet
pair
of
diamond
earrings
mayhap
and
a
little
shower
of
patches
which
ornament
a
lady
face
wondrously
and
a
leetle
rouge
though
egad
such
as
yours
do
want
it
fie
catherine
i
should
think
the
birds
must
come
and
peck
at
them
as
if
they
were
fruit
corporal
over
the
wall
and
of
our
fellows
jumped
after
me
by
the
pope
of
rome
friend
tummas
that
was
a
day
had
you
seen
how
the
mounseers
looked
when
rampaging
sword
and
pistol
cut
and
thrust
came
tumbling
into
the
redoubt
why
sir
we
left
in
three
minutes
as
many
artillerymen
heads
as
there
were
it
was
ah
sacre
d
you
take
that
o
mon
dieu
run
him
through
ventrebleu
and
it
was
ventrebleu
with
him
i
warrant
you
for
bleu
in
the
french
language
means
through
and
ventre
why
you
see
ventre
means
captain
waists
which
are
worn
now
excessive
long
and
for
the
hoops
if
you
could
but
see
them
stap
my
vitals
my
dear
but
there
was
a
lady
at
warwick
assembly
she
came
in
one
of
my
lord
coaches
who
had
a
hoop
as
big
as
a
tent
you
might
have
dined
under
it
comfortably
ha
ha
my
faith
now
corporal
and
there
we
found
the
duke
of
marlborough
seated
along
with
marshal
tallard
who
was
endeavouring
to
drown
his
sorrow
over
a
cup
of
johannisberger
wine
and
a
good
drink
too
my
lads
only
not
to
compare
to
warwick
beer
who
was
the
man
who
has
done
this
said
our
noble
general
i
stepped
up
how
many
heads

he
that
you
cut
off
nineteen

i
besides
wounding
when
he
heard
it
hayes

blest
if
he
did
burst
into
tears
noble
noble
fellow
says
he
marshal

must
excuse
me
if

am
pleased
to
hear

smile
on
jack

grave
face
at
this
piece
of
generosity
so
beckoning
colonel

up
to
him
he
pinched
his
ear
and
whispered
captain

i
have
the
honour
to
dance
a
minuet
with
your

the
whole
room
was
in
titters
at
jack

very
well
poor

wooden

foony

sergeant
zure
enoff
this
little
specimen
of
the
conversation
must
be
sufficient
it
will
show
pretty
clearly
that
each
of
the
two
military
commanders
was
conducting
his
operations
with
perfect
success
three
of
the
detachment
of
five
attacked
by
the
corporal
surrendered
to
him
bullock
namely
who
gave
in
at
a
very
early
stage
of
the
evening
and
ignominiously
laid
down
his
arms
under
the
table
after
standing
not
more
than
a
dozen
volleys
of
beer
blacksmith
boy
and
a
labourer
whose
name
we
have
not
been
able
to
learn
butcher
himself
was
on
the
point
of
yielding
when
he
was
rescued
by
the
furious
charge
of
a
detachment
that
marched
to
his
relief
his
wife
namely
who
with
two
squalling
children
rushed
into
the
bugle
boxed
butcher
ears
and
kept
up
such
a
tremendous
fire
of
oaths
and
screams
upon
the
corporal
that
he
was
obliged
to
retreat
fixing
then
her
claws
into
hair
she
proceeded
to
drag
him
out
of
the
premises
and
thus
brock
was
overcome
his
attack
upon
john
hayes
was
a
still
greater
failure
for
that
young
man
seemed
to
be
invincible
by
drink
if
not
by
love
and
at
the
end
of
the
was
a
great
deal
more
cool
than
the
corporal
himself
to
whom
he
wished
a
very
polite
as
calmly
he
took
his
hat
to
depart
he
turned
to
look
at
catherine
to
be
sure
and
then
he
was
not
quite
so
calm
but
catherine
did
not
give
any
reply
to
his
she
was
seated
at
the
captain
table
playing
at
cribbage
with
him
and
though
count
gustavus
maximilian
lost
every
game
he
won
more
than
he
lost
sly
fellow
and
catherine
was
no
match
for
him
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
hayes
gave
some
information
to
mrs
score
the
landlady
for
on
leaving
the
kitchen
he
was
seen
to
linger
for
a
moment
in
the
bar
and
very
soon
after
catherine
was
called
away
from
her
attendance
on
the
count
who
when
he
asked
for
a
sack
and
toast
was
furnished
with
those
articles
by
the
landlady
herself
and
during
the
in
which
he
was
employed
in
consuming
this
drink
monsieur
de
galgenstein
looked
very
much
disturbed
and
out
of
humour
and
cast
his
eyes
to
the
door
perpetually
but
no
catherine
came
at
last
very
sulkily
he
desired
to
be
shown
to
bed
and
walked
as
well
as
he
could
for
to
say
truth
the
noble
count
was
by
this
time
somewhat
unsteady
on
his
legs
to
his
chamber
it
was
mrs
score
who
showed
him
to
it
and
closed
the
curtains
and
pointed
triumphantly
to
the
whiteness
of
the
sheets
it
a
very
comfortable
room
said
she
though
not
the
best
in
the
house
which
belong
of
right
to
your
lordship
worship
but
our
best
room
has
two
beds
and
corporal
is
in
that
locked
and
with
his
three
tipsy
recruits
but
your
honour
will
find
this
here
bed
comfortable
and
i
slept
in
it
myself
this
eighteen
what
my
good
woman
you
are
going
to
sit
up
eh
it
cruel
hard
on
you
sit
up
my
lord
bless
you
no
i
shall
have
half
of
our
cat
bed
as
i
always
do
when
there
and
with
this
mrs
score
curtseyed
and
retired
very
early
the
next
morning
the
active
landlady
and
her
bustling
attendant
had
prepared
the
ale
and
bacon
for
the
corporal
and
his
three
converts
and
had
set
a
nice
white
cloth
for
the
captain
breakfast
the
young
blacksmith
did
not
eat
with
much
satisfaction
but
bullock
and
his
friend
betrayed
no
sign
of
discontent
except
such
as
may
be
consequent
upon
an
evening
carouse
they
walked
very
contentedly
to
be
registered
before
doctor
dobbs
who
was
also
justice
of
the
peace
and
went
in
search
of
their
slender
bundles
and
took
leave
of
their
few
acquaintances
without
much
regret
for
the
gentlemen
had
been
bred
in
the
workhouse
and
had
not
therefore
a
large
circle
of
friends
it
wanted
only
an
hour
of
noon
and
the
noble
count
had
not
descended
the
men
were
waiting
for
him
and
spent
much
of
the
queen
money
earned
by
the
sale
of
their
bodies
overnight
while
thus
expecting
him
perhaps
catherine
expected
him
too
for
she
had
offered
many
times
to
run
up
with
my
lord
boots
with
the
hot
water
to
show
brock
the
way
who
sometimes
condescended
to
officiate
as
barber
but
on
all
these
occasions
mrs
score
had
prevented
her
not
scolding
but
with
much
gentleness
and
smiling
at
last
more
gentle
and
smiling
than
ever
she
came
downstairs
and
said
catherine
darling
his
honour
the
count
is
mighty
hungry
this
morning
and
vows
he
could
pick
the
wing
of
a
fowl
run
down
child
to
farmer
brigg
and
get
one
pluck
it
before
you
bring
it
you
know
and
we
will
make
his
lordship
a
pretty
catherine
took
up
her
basket
and
away
she
went
by
the
through
the
stables
there
she
heard
the
little
whistling
and
hissing
after
the
manner
of
horseboys
and
there
she
learned
that
mrs
score
had
been
inventing
an
ingenious
story
to
have
her
out
of
the
way
the
ostler
said
he
was
just
going
to
lead
the
two
horses
round
to
the
door
the
corporal
had
been
and
they
were
about
to
start
on
the
instant
for
stratford
the
fact
was
that
count
gustavus
adolphus
far
from
wishing
to
pick
the
wing
of
a
fowl
had
risen
with
a
horror
and
loathing
for
everything
in
the
shape
of
food
and
for
any
liquor
stronger
than
small
beer
of
this
he
had
drunk
a
cup
and
said
he
should
ride
immediately
to
stratford
and
when
on
ordering
his
horses
he
had
asked
politely
of
the
landlady
why
the
d
she
always
came
up
and
why
she
did
not
send
the
girl
mrs
score
informed
the
count
that
her
catherine
was
gone
out
for
a
walk
along
with
the
young
man
to
whom
she
was
to
be
married
and
would
not
be
visible
that
day
on
hearing
this
the
captain
ordered
his
horses
that
moment
and
abused
the
wine
the
bed
the
house
the
landlady
and
everything
connected
with
the
bugle
out
the
horses
came
the
little
boys
of
the
village
gathered
round
the
recruits
with
bunches
of
ribands
in
their
beavers
appeared
presently
corporal
brock
came
swaggering
out
and
slapping
the
pleased
blacksmith
on
the
back
bade
him
mount
his
horse
while
the
boys
hurrah
then
the
captain
came
out
gloomy
and
majestic
to
him
brock
made
a
military
salute
which
clumsily
and
with
much
grinning
the
recruits
imitated
i
shall
walk
on
with
these
brave
fellows
your
honour
and
meet
you
at
stratford
said
the
corporal
good
said
the
captain
as
he
mounted
the
landlady
curtseyed
the
children
hurrah
more
the
little
who
held
the
bridle
with
one
hand
and
the
stirrup
with
the
other
and
expected
a
from
such
a
noble
gentleman
got
only
a
kick
and
a
curse
as
count
von
galgenstein
shouted
d
you
all
get
out
of
the
way
and
galloped
off
and
john
hayes
who
had
been
sneaking
about
the
inn
all
the
morning
felt
a
weight
off
his
heart
when
he
saw
the
captain
ride
off
alone
o
foolish
mrs
score
o
dolt
of
a
john
hayes
if
the
landlady
had
allowed
the
captain
and
the
maid
to
have
their
way
and
meet
but
for
a
minute
before
recruits
sergeant
and
all
it
is
probable
that
no
harm
would
have
been
done
and
that
this
history
would
never
have
been
written
when
count
von
galgenstein
had
ridden
half
a
mile
on
the
stratford
road
looking
as
black
and
dismal
as
napoleon
galloping
from
the
romantic
village
of
waterloo
he
espied
a
few
score
yards
onwards
at
the
turn
of
the
road
a
certain
object
which
caused
him
to
check
his
horse
suddenly
brought
a
tingling
red
into
his
cheeks
and
made
his
heart
to
go
thump
thump
against
his
side
a
young
lass
was
sauntering
slowly
along
the
footpath
with
a
basket
swinging
from
one
hand
and
a
bunch
of
in
the
other
she
stopped
once
or
twice
to
add
a
fresh
one
to
her
nosegay
and
might
have
seen
him
the
captain
thought
but
no
she
never
looked
directly
towards
him
and
still
walked
on
sweet
innocent
she
was
singing
as
if
none
were
near
her
voice
went
soaring
up
to
the
clear
sky
and
the
captain
put
his
horse
on
the
grass
that
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
might
not
disturb
the
music
when
the
kine
had
given
a
pailful
and
the
sheep
came
bleating
home
poll
who
knew
it
would
be
healthful
went
out
with
tom
hand
in
hand
sir
on
the
land
sir
as
they
walked
to
and
fro
tom
made
jolly
love
to
polly
but
was
answered
no
no
the
captain
had
put
his
horse
on
the
grass
that
the
sound
of
his
hoofs
might
not
disturb
the
music
and
now
he
pushed
its
head
on
to
the
bank
where
straightway
george
of
denmark
began
chewing
of
such
a
salad
as
grew
there
and
now
the
captain
slid
off
stealthily
and
smiling
comically
and
hitching
up
his
great
and
moving
forward
with
a
jerking
tiptoe
step
he
just
as
she
was
trilling
the
last
of
the
last
no
in
the
above
poem
of
tom
came
up
to
her
and
touching
her
lightly
on
the
waist
said
my
dear
your
very
humble
catherine
you
know
you
have
found
her
out
long
ago
gave
a
scream
and
a
start
and
would
have
turned
pale
if
she
could
as
it
was
she
only
shook
all
over
and
said
oh
sir
how
you
did
frighten
me
frighten
you
my
rosebud
why
run
me
through
i
die

than
frighten

frightful

all
for
if

i
was
going
to
fetch
a
chicken
for
your
lordship
breakfast
as
my
mistress
said
you
would

and
i
thought
instead
of
going
to
farmer
brigg
down
birmingham
way
as
she
told
me
i
go
to
farmer
bird
where
the
chickens

my
lord
i
said
i

a
chicken
for

old
cat
why
i
told
her
i
would
not
eat
a
morsel
to
save
me
i
was
so
dru
i
mean
i
ate
such
a
good
supper
last
night
and
i
bade
her
to
send
me
a
pot
of
small
beer
and
to
tell
you
to
bring
it
and
the
wretch
said
you
were
gone
out
with
your
sweetheart
what
john
hayes
the
creature
oh
what
a
naughty
woman
you
had
walked
out
with
your
sweetheart
and
i
was
not
to
see

more
and
i
was
mad
with
rage
and
ready
to
kill
myself
i
was
my
oh

sweet
angel

beautiful
cruel
wicked
catherine
catherine
reply
to
this
was
la
bless
me
i
do
believe
your
horse
is
running
and
so
he
was
for
having
finished
his
meal
in
the
hedge
he
first
looked
towards
his
master
and
paused
as
it
were
irresolutely
then
by
a
sudden
impulse
flinging
up
his
tail
and
his
hind
legs
he
scampered
down
the
road
hall
ran
lightly
after
the
horse
and
the
captain
after
hall
and
the
horse
ran
quicker
and
quicker
every
moment
and
might
have
led
them
a
long
chase
when
lo
debouching
from
a
twist
in
the
road
came
the
detachment
of
cavalry
and
infantry
under
brock
the
moment
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
village
that
gentleman
had
desired
the
blacksmith
to
dismount
and
had
himself
jumped
into
the
saddle
maintaining
the
subordination
of
his
army
by
drawing
a
pistol
and
swearing
that
he
would
blow
out
the
brains
of
any
person
who
attempted
to
run
when
the
captain
horse
came
near
the
detachment
he
paused
and
suffered
himself
to
be
caught
by
tummas
bullock
who
held
him
until
the
owner
and
catherine
came
up
bullock
looked
comically
grave
when
he
saw
the
pair
but
the
corporal
graciously
saluted
catherine
and
said
it
was
a
fine
day
for
walking
la
sir
and
so
it
is
said
she
panting
in
a
very
pretty
and
distressing
way
but
not
for
running
i
do
protest
ha
and
vow
that
i
really
can
scarcely
stand
i
so
tired
of
running
after
that
naughty
naughty
horse
how
do
cattern
said
thomas
zee
i
be
going
a
zouldiering
because
thee
would
have
and
here
bullock
grinned
catherine
made
no
sort
of
reply
but
protested
once
more
she
should
die
of
running
if
the
truth
were
told
she
was
somewhat
vexed
at
the
arrival
of
the
corporal
detachment
and
had
had
very
serious
thoughts
of
finding
herself
quite
tired
just
as
he
came
in
sight
a
sudden
thought
brought
a
smile
of
bright
satisfaction
in
the
eyes
he
mounted
the
horse
which
tummas
still
held
tired
mrs
catherine
said
he
and
for
my
sake
by
heavens
you
sha
walk
a
step
farther
no
you
shall
ride
back
with
a
guard
of
honour
back
to
the
village
gentlemen
rightabout
face
show
those
fellows
corporal
how
to
rightabout
face
now
my
dear
mount
behind
me
on
snowball
easy
as
a
sedan
put
your
dear
little
foot
on
the
toe
of
my
boot
there
now
up
jump
hurrah
that
not
the
way
captain
shouted
out
thomas
still
holding
on
to
the
rein
as
the
horse
began
to
move
thee
woa
goo
with
him
will
thee
catty
but
catherine
though
she
turned
away
her
head
never
let
go
her
hold
round
the
captain
waist
and
he
swearing
a
dreadful
oath
at
thomas
struck
him
across
the
face
and
hands
with
his
riding
whip
the
poor
fellow
who
at
the
first
cut
still
held
on
to
the
rein
dropped
it
at
the
second
and
as
the
pair
galloped
off
sat
down
on
the
roadside
and
fairly
began
to
weep
march
you
dog
shouted
out
the
corporal
a
minute
after
and
so
he
did
and
when
next
he
saw
catherine
she
was
the
captain
lady
sure
enough
and
wore
a
grey
hat
with
a
blue
feather
and
red
trimmed
with
silverlace
but
thomas
was
then
on
a
horse
which
corporal
brock
was
flanking
round
a
ring
and
he
was
so
occupied
looking
between
his
horse
ears
that
he
had
no
time
to
cry
then
and
at
length
got
the
better
of
his
attachment
this
being
a
good
opportunity
for
closing
chapter
i
we
ought
perhaps
to
make
some
apologies
to
the
public
for
introducing
them
to
characters
that
are
so
utterly
worthless
as
we
confess
all
our
heroes
with
the
exception
of
bullock
to
be
in
this
we
have
consulted
nature
and
history
rather
than
the
prevailing
taste
and
the
general
manner
of
authors
the
amusing
novel
of
ernest
maltravers
for
instance
opens
with
a
seduction
but
then
it
is
performed
by
people
of
the
strictest
virtue
on
both
sides
and
there
is
so
much
religion
and
philosophy
in
the
heart
of
the
seducer
so
much
tender
innocence
in
the
soul
of
the
seduced
that
bless
the
little
dears
their
very
peccadilloes
make
one
interested
in
them
and
their
naughtiness
becomes
quite
sacred
so
deliciously
is
it
described
now
if
we
are
to
be
interested
by
rascally
actions
let
us
have
them
with
plain
faces
and
let
them
be
performed
not
by
virtuous
philosophers
but
by
rascals
another
clever
class
of
novelists
adopt
the
contrary
system
and
create
interest
by
making
their
rascals
perform
virtuous
actions
against
these
popular
plans
we
here
solemnly
appeal
we
say
let
your
rogues
in
novels
act
like
rogues
and
your
honest
men
like
honest
men
do
let
us
have
any
juggling
and
with
virtue
and
vice
so
that
at
the
end
of
three
volumes
the
bewildered
reader
shall
not
know
which
is
which
do
let
us
find
ourselves
kindling
at
the
generous
qualities
of
thieves
and
sympathising
with
the
rascalities
of
noble
hearts
for
our
own
part
we
know
what
the
public
likes
and
have
chosen
rogues
for
our
characters
and
have
taken
a
story
from
the
newgate
calendar
which
we
hope
to
follow
out
to
edification
among
the
rogues
at
least
we
will
have
nothing
that
shall
be
mistaken
for
virtues
and
if
the
british
public
after
calling
for
three
or
four
editions
shall
give
up
not
only
our
rascals
but
the
rascals
of
all
other
authors
we
shall
be
content
we
shall
apply
to
government
for
a
pension
and
think
that
our
duty
is
done
chapter
ii
in
which
are
depicted
the
pleasures
of
a
sentimental
attachment
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
this
history
to
follow
out
very
closely
all
the
adventures
which
occurred
to
catherine
from
the
period
when
she
quitted
the
bugle
and
became
the
captain
lady
for
although
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
show
as
not
that
the
young
woman
by
following
the
man
of
her
heart
had
only
yielded
to
an
innocent
impulse
and
by
remaining
with
him
for
a
certain
period
had
proved
the
depth
and
strength
of
her
affection
for
him
although
we
might
make
very
tender
and
eloquent
apologies
for
the
error
of
both
parties
the
reader
might
possibly
be
disgusted
at
such
descriptions
and
such
arguments
which
besides
are
already
done
to
his
hand
in
the
novel
of
ernest
maltravers
before
mentioned
from
the
gentleman
manner
towards
catherine
and
from
his
brilliant
and
immediate
success
the
reader
will
doubtless
have
concluded
in
the
first
place
that
gustavus
adolphus
had
not
a
very
violent
affection
for
cat
in
the
second
place
that
he
was
a
professional
and
therefore
likely
at
some
period
to
resume
his
profession
thirdly
and
to
conclude
that
a
connection
so
begun
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
likely
to
end
speedily
and
so
to
do
the
count
justice
it
would
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
follow
his
own
inclination
entirely
for
as
many
young
gentlemen
will
and
yet
no
praise
to
them
in
about
a
week
he
began
to
be
indifferent
in
a
month
to
be
weary
in
two
months
to
be
angry
in
three
to
proceed
to
blows
and
curses
and
in
short
to
repent
most
bitterly
the
hour
when
he
had
ever
been
induced
to
present
catherine
the
toe
of
his
boot
for
the
purpose
of
lifting
her
on
to
his
horse
egad
said
he
to
the
corporal
one
day
when
confiding
his
griefs
to
brock
i
wish
my
toe
had
been
cut
off
before
ever
it
served
as
a
ladder
to
this
little
or
perhaps
your
honour
would
wish
to
kick
her
downstairs
with
it
delicately
suggested
brock
kick
her
why
the
wench
would
hold
so
fast
by
the
banisters
that
i
could
not
kick
her
down
brock
to
tell
you
a
bit
of
a
secret
i
have
tried
as
much
not
to
kick
her
no
no
not
kick
her
certainly
that
ungentlemanly
but
to
induce
her
to
go
back
to
that
cursed
where
we
fell
in
with
her
i
have
given
her
many
hints
oh
yes
i
saw
your
honour
give
her
one
yesterday
with
a
mug
of
beer
by
the
laws
as
the
ale
run
all
down
her
face
and
she
clutched
a
knife
to
run
at
you
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
such
a
that
woman
will
do
for
your
honour
some
day
if
you
provoke
do
for
me
no
hang
it
brock
never
she
loves
every
hair
of
my
head
sir
she
worships
me
corporal
egad
yes
she
worships
me
and
would
much
sooner
apply
a
knife
to
her
own
weasand
than
scratch
my
little
finger
i
think
she
does
said
brock
i
sure
of
it
said
the
captain
women
look
you
are
like
dogs
they
like
to
be
they
like
it
sir
i
know
they
do
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
woman
in
my
life
but
i
her
and
she
liked
me
the
mrs
hall
ought
to
be
very
fond
of
you
then
sure
enough
said
corporal
very
fond
ha
ha
corporal
you
wag
you
and
so
she
is
very
fond
yesterday
after
the
scene
no
wonder
i
threw
the
liquor
in
her
face
it
was
so
flat
that
no
gentleman
could
drink
it
and
i
told
her
never
to
draw
it
till
oh
it
was
enough
to
put
an
angel
in
a
fury
said
brock
well
yesterday
after
the
knife
business
when
you
had
got
the
carver
out
of
her
hand
off
she
flings
to
her
bedroom
will
not
eat
a
bit
of
dinner
forsooth
and
remains
locked
up
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
two
afternoon
i
was
over
a
tankard
out
comes
the
little
her
face
pale
her
eyes
bleared
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
as
red
as
fire
with
sniffling
and
weeping
making
for
my
hand
says
she
you
forgive
me
says
i
a
murderess
says
i
curse
me
never
cruelty
will
kill
me
sobbed
she
be
hanged
says
i
you
draw
that
beer
an
hour
before
dinner
she
could
say
nothing
to
this
you
know
and
i
swore
that
every
time
she
did
so
i
would
fling
it
into
her
face
again
whereupon
back
she
flounced
to
her
chamber
where
she
wept
and
stormed
until
when
you
forgave
her
i
did
forgive
her
that
positive
you
see
i
had
supped
at
the
along
with
tom
trippet
and
pretty
fellows
and
i
had
eased
a
great
warwickshire
landjunker
what
d
call
him
squire
of
forty
pieces
and
i
when
i
won
and
so
cat
and
i
made
it
up
but
i
taught
her
never
to
bring
me
stale
beer
again
ha
ha
this
conversation
will
explain
a
great
deal
better
than
any
description
of
ours
however
eloquent
the
state
of
things
as
between
count
maximilian
and
catherine
and
the
feelings
which
they
entertained
for
each
other
the
woman
loved
him
that
was
the
fact
and
as
we
have
shown
in
the
previous
chapter
how
john
hayes
a
fellow
as
ever
breathed
in
respect
of
all
other
passions
a
pigmy
was
in
the
passion
of
love
a
giant
and
followed
catherine
with
a
furious
longing
which
might
seem
at
the
first
to
be
foreign
to
his
nature
in
the
like
manner
and
playing
at
hall
had
become
smitten
of
the
captain
and
as
he
said
truly
only
liked
him
the
better
for
the
brutality
which
she
received
at
his
hands
for
it
is
my
opinion
madam
that
love
is
a
bodily
infirmity
from
which
humankind
can
no
more
escape
than
from
and
which
attacks
every
one
of
us
from
the
first
duke
in
the
peerage
down
to
jack
ketch
inclusive
which
has
no
respect
for
rank
virtue
or
roguery
in
man
but
sets
each
in
his
turn
in
a
fever
which
breaks
out
the
deuce
knows
how
or
why
and
raging
its
appointed
time
fills
each
individual
of
the
one
sex
with
a
blind
fury
and
longing
for
some
one
of
the
other
who
may
be
pure
gentle
beautiful
and
good
or
vile
shrewish
squinting
hunchbacked
and
hideous
according
to
circumstances
and
luck
which
dies
away
perhaps
in
the
natural
course
if
left
to
have
its
way
but
which
contradiction
causes
to
rage
more
furiously
than
ever
is
not
history
from
the
trojan
war
upwards
and
downwards
full
of
instances
of
such
strange
inexplicable
passions
was
not
helen
by
the
most
moderate
calculation
ninety
years
of
age
when
she
went
off
with
his
royal
highness
prince
paris
of
troy
was
not
madame
la
valliere
scraggy
and
with
hair
like
tow
was
not
wilkes
the
ugliest
charmingest
most
successful
man
in
the
world
such
instances
might
be
carried
out
so
as
to
fill
a
volume
but
cui
bono
love
is
fate
and
not
will
its
origin
not
to
be
explained
its
progress
irresistible
and
the
best
proof
of
this
may
be
had
at
bow
street
any
day
where
if
you
ask
any
officer
of
the
establishment
how
they
take
most
thieves
he
will
tell
you
at
the
houses
of
the
women
they
must
see
the
dear
creatures
though
they
hang
for
it
they
will
love
though
they
have
their
necks
in
the
halter
and
with
regard
to
the
other
position
that
on
the
part
of
the
man
does
not
destroy
the
affection
of
the
woman
have
we
not
numberless
showing
how
when
a
bystander
would
beat
a
husband
for
beating
his
wife
man
and
wife
fall
together
on
the
interloper
and
punish
him
for
his
meddling
these
points
then
being
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
the
reader
will
not
be
disposed
to
question
the
assertion
that
hall
had
a
real
affection
for
the
gallant
count
and
grew
as
brock
was
pleased
to
say
like
a
beefsteak
more
tender
as
she
was
thumped
poor
thing
poor
thing
his
flashy
airs
and
smart
looks
had
overcome
her
in
a
single
hour
and
no
more
is
wanted
to
plunge
into
love
over
head
and
ears
no
more
is
wanted
to
make
a
first
love
with
and
a
woman
first
love
lasts
for
ever
a
man
or
is
perhaps
the
best
you
ca
kill
it
do
what
you
will
it
takes
root
and
lives
and
even
grows
never
mind
what
the
soil
may
be
in
which
it
is
planted
or
the
bitter
weather
it
must
bear
often
as
one
has
seen
a
wallflower
grow
out
of
a
stone
in
the
first
weeks
of
their
union
the
count
had
at
least
been
liberal
to
her
she
had
a
horse
and
fine
clothes
and
received
abroad
some
of
those
flattering
attentions
which
she
held
at
such
high
price
he
had
however
some
at
play
or
had
been
forced
to
pay
some
bills
or
had
some
other
satisfactory
reason
for
being
poor
and
his
establishment
was
very
speedily
diminished
he
argued
that
as
catherine
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
others
all
her
life
she
might
now
wait
upon
herself
and
him
and
when
the
incident
of
the
beer
arose
she
had
been
for
some
time
employed
as
the
count
housekeeper
with
unlimited
superintendence
over
his
comfort
his
cellar
his
linen
and
such
matters
as
bachelors
are
delighted
to
make
over
to
active
female
hands
to
do
the
poor
wretch
justice
she
actually
kept
the
man
menage
in
the
best
order
nor
was
there
any
point
of
extravagance
with
which
she
could
be
charged
except
a
little
extravagance
of
dress
displayed
on
the
very
few
occasions
when
he
condescended
to
walk
abroad
with
her
and
extravagance
of
language
and
passion
in
the
frequent
quarrels
they
had
together
perhaps
in
such
a
connection
as
subsisted
between
this
precious
couple
these
faults
are
inevitable
on
the
part
of
the
woman
she
must
be
silly
and
vain
and
will
pretty
surely
therefore
be
fond
of
dress
and
she
must
disguise
it
as
she
will
be
perpetually
miserable
and
brooding
over
her
fall
which
will
cause
her
to
be
violent
and
quarrelsome
such
at
least
was
hall
and
very
early
did
the
poor
vain
misguided
wretch
begin
to
reap
what
she
had
sown
for
a
man
remorse
under
these
circumstances
is
perhaps
uncommon
no
stigma
affixes
on
him
for
betraying
a
woman
no
bitter
pangs
of
mortified
vanity
no
insulting
looks
of
superiority
from
his
neighbour
and
no
sentence
of
contemptuous
banishment
is
read
against
him
these
all
fall
on
the
tempted
and
not
on
the
tempter
who
is
permitted
to
go
free
the
chief
thing
that
a
man
learns
after
having
successfully
practised
on
a
woman
is
to
despise
the
poor
wretch
whom
he
has
won
the
game
in
fact
and
the
glory
such
as
it
is
is
all
his
and
the
punishment
alone
falls
upon
her
consider
this
ladies
when
charming
young
gentlemen
come
to
woo
you
with
soft
speeches
you
have
nothing
to
win
except
wretchedness
and
scorn
and
desertion
consider
this
and
be
thankful
to
your
solomons
for
telling
it
it
came
to
pass
then
that
the
count
had
come
to
have
a
perfect
contempt
and
indifference
for
hall
how
should
he
not
for
a
young
person
who
had
given
herself
up
to
him
so
easily
and
would
have
been
quite
glad
of
any
opportunity
of
parting
with
her
but
there
was
a
certain
lingering
shame
about
the
man
which
prevented
him
from
saying
at
once
and
abruptly
go
and
the
poor
thing
did
not
choose
to
take
such
hints
as
fell
out
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
and
quarrels
and
so
they
kept
on
together
he
treating
her
with
simple
insult
and
she
hanging
on
desperately
by
whatever
feeble
twig
she
could
find
to
the
rock
beyond
which
all
was
naught
or
death
to
her
well
after
the
night
with
tom
trippet
and
the
pretty
fellows
at
the
rose
to
which
we
have
heard
the
count
allude
in
the
conversation
just
recorded
fortune
smiled
on
him
a
good
deal
for
the
warwickshire
squire
who
had
lost
forty
pieces
on
that
occasion
insisted
on
having
his
revenge
the
night
after
when
strange
to
say
a
hundred
and
fifty
more
found
their
way
into
the
pouch
of
his
excellency
the
count
such
a
sum
as
this
quite
set
the
young
nobleman
afloat
again
and
brought
back
a
pleasing
equanimity
to
his
mind
which
had
been
a
good
deal
disturbed
in
the
former
difficult
circumstances
and
in
this
for
a
little
and
to
a
certain
extent
poor
cat
had
the
happiness
to
share
he
did
not
alter
the
style
of
his
establishment
which
consisted
as
before
of
herself
and
a
small
person
who
acted
as
scourer
and
scullion
catherine
always
putting
her
hand
to
the
principal
pieces
of
the
dinner
but
he
treated
his
mistress
with
tolerable
or
to
speak
more
correctly
with
such
bearable
brutality
as
might
be
expected
from
a
man
like
him
to
a
woman
in
her
condition
besides
a
certain
event
was
about
to
take
place
which
not
unusually
occurs
in
circumstances
of
this
nature
and
catherine
was
expecting
soon
to
lie
in
the
captain
distrusting
naturally
the
strength
of
his
own
paternal
feelings
had
kindly
endeavoured
to
provide
a
parent
for
the
coming
infant
and
to
this
end
had
opened
a
negotiation
with
our
friend
thomas
bullock
declaring
that
cat
should
have
a
fortune
of
twenty
guineas
and
reminding
tummas
of
his
ancient
flame
for
her
but
tummas
when
this
proposition
was
made
to
him
declined
it
with
many
oaths
and
vowed
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
present
bachelor
condition
in
this
dilemma
brock
stepped
forward
who
declared
himself
very
ready
to
accept
catherine
and
her
fortune
and
might
possibly
have
become
the
possessor
of
both
had
not
cat
the
moment
she
heard
of
the
proposed
arrangement
with
fire
in
her
eyes
and
rage
oh
how
bitter
in
her
heart
prevented
the
success
of
the
measure
by
proceeding
incontinently
to
the
first
justice
of
the
peace
and
there
swearing
before
his
worship
who
was
the
father
of
the
coming
child
this
proceeding
which
she
had
expected
would
cause
not
a
little
indignation
on
the
part
of
her
lord
and
master
was
received
by
him
strangely
enough
with
considerable
he
swore
that
the
wench
had
served
him
a
good
trick
and
was
rather
amused
at
the
anger
the
outbreak
of
fierce
rage
and
contumely
and
the
wretched
wretched
tears
of
heartsick
desperation
which
followed
her
announcement
of
this
step
to
him
for
brock
she
repelled
his
offer
with
scorn
and
loathing
and
treated
the
notion
of
a
union
with
bullock
with
yet
fiercer
contempt
marry
him
indeed
a
workhouse
pauper
carrying
a
she
would
have
died
sooner
she
said
or
robbed
on
the
highway
and
so
to
do
her
justice
she
would
for
the
little
minx
was
one
of
the
vainest
creatures
in
existence
and
vanity
as
i
presume
everybody
knows
becomes
the
principle
in
certain
women
hearts
their
moral
spectacles
their
conscience
their
meat
and
drink
their
only
rule
of
right
and
wrong
as
for
tummas
he
as
we
have
seen
was
quite
unfriendly
to
the
proposition
as
she
could
be
and
the
corporal
with
a
good
deal
of
comical
gravity
vowed
that
as
he
could
not
be
satisfied
in
his
dearest
wishes
he
would
take
to
drinking
for
a
consolation
which
he
straightway
did
come
tummas
said
he
to
bullock
since
we
ca
have
the
girl
of
our
hearts
why
hang
it
tummas
let
drink
her
health
to
which
bullock
had
no
objection
and
so
strongly
did
the
disappointment
weigh
upon
honest
corporal
brock
that
even
when
after
quantities
of
beer
he
could
scarcely
utter
a
word
he
was
seen
absolutely
to
weep
and
in
accents
almost
unintelligible
to
curse
his
confounded
at
being
deprived
not
of
a
wife
but
of
a
child
he
wanted
one
so
he
said
to
comfort
him
in
his
old
age
the
time
of
catherine
couche
drew
near
arrived
and
was
gone
through
safely
she
presented
to
the
world
a
chopping
boy
who
might
use
if
he
liked
the
galgenstein
arms
with
a
and
in
her
new
cares
and
duties
had
not
so
many
opportunities
as
usual
of
quarrelling
with
the
count
who
perhaps
respected
her
situation
or
at
least
was
so
properly
aware
of
the
necessity
of
quiet
to
her
that
he
absented
himself
from
home
morning
noon
and
night
the
captain
had
it
must
be
confessed
turned
these
continued
absences
to
a
considerable
worldly
profit
for
he
played
incessantly
and
since
his
first
victory
over
the
warwickshire
squire
fortune
had
been
so
favourable
to
him
that
he
had
at
various
intervals
amassed
a
sum
of
nearly
a
thousand
pounds
which
he
used
to
bring
home
as
he
won
and
which
he
deposited
in
a
strong
iron
chest
cunningly
screwed
down
by
himself
under
his
own
bed
this
catherine
regularly
made
and
the
treasure
underneath
it
could
be
no
secret
to
her
however
the
noble
count
kept
the
key
and
bound
her
by
many
solemn
oaths
that
he
discharged
at
her
himself
not
to
reveal
to
any
other
person
the
existence
of
the
chest
and
its
contents
but
it
is
not
in
a
woman
nature
to
keep
such
secrets
and
the
captain
who
left
her
for
days
and
days
did
not
reflect
that
she
would
seek
for
confidants
elsewhere
for
want
of
a
female
companion
she
was
compelled
to
bestow
her
sympathies
upon
brock
who
as
the
corporal
was
much
in
his
lodgings
and
who
did
manage
to
survive
the
disappointment
which
he
had
experienced
by
catherine
refusal
of
him
about
two
months
after
the
infant
birth
the
captain
who
was
annoyed
by
its
squalling
put
it
abroad
to
nurse
and
dismissed
its
attendant
catherine
now
resumed
her
household
duties
and
was
as
before
at
once
mistress
and
servant
of
the
establishment
as
such
she
had
the
keys
of
the
beer
and
was
pretty
sure
of
the
attentions
of
the
corporal
who
became
as
we
have
said
in
the
count
absence
his
lady
chief
friend
and
companion
after
the
manner
of
ladies
she
very
speedily
confided
to
him
all
her
domestic
secrets
the
causes
of
her
former
discontent
the
count
of
her
the
wicked
names
he
called
her
the
prices
that
all
her
gowns
had
cost
her
how
he
beat
her
how
much
money
he
won
and
lost
at
play
how
she
had
once
pawned
a
coat
for
him
how
he
had
four
new
ones
laced
and
paid
for
what
was
the
best
way
of
cleaning
and
keeping
of
making
pickling
salmon
etc
her
confidences
upon
all
these
subjects
used
to
follow
each
other
in
rapid
succession
and
brock
became
ere
long
quite
as
well
acquainted
with
the
captain
history
for
the
last
year
as
the
count
himself
for
he
was
careless
and
forgot
things
women
never
do
they
chronicle
all
the
lover
small
actions
his
words
his
headaches
the
dresses
he
has
worn
the
things
he
has
liked
for
dinner
on
certain
days
all
which
circumstances
commonly
are
expunged
from
the
male
brain
immediately
after
they
have
occurred
but
remain
fixed
with
the
female
to
brock
then
and
to
brock
only
for
she
knew
no
other
soul
cat
breathed
in
strictest
confidence
the
history
of
the
count
winnings
and
his
way
of
disposing
of
them
how
he
kept
his
money
screwed
down
in
an
iron
chest
in
their
room
and
a
very
lucky
fellow
did
brock
consider
his
officer
for
having
such
a
large
sum
he
and
cat
looked
at
the
chest
it
was
small
but
mighty
strong
sure
enough
and
would
defy
picklocks
and
thieves
well
if
any
man
deserved
money
the
captain
did
though
he
might
buy
me
a
few
yards
of
that
lace
i
love
so
interrupted
cat
if
any
man
deserved
money
he
did
for
he
spent
it
like
a
prince
and
his
hand
was
always
in
his
pocket
it
must
now
be
stated
that
monsieur
de
galgenstein
had
during
seclusion
cast
his
eyes
upon
a
young
lady
of
good
fortune
who
frequented
the
assembly
at
birmingham
and
who
was
not
a
little
smitten
by
his
title
and
person
the
four
new
coats
laced
and
paid
for
as
cat
said
had
been
purchased
most
probably
by
his
excellency
for
the
purpose
of
dazzling
the
heiress
and
he
and
the
coats
had
succeeded
so
far
as
to
win
from
the
young
woman
an
actual
profession
of
love
and
a
promise
of
marriage
provided
pa
would
consent
this
was
obtained
for
pa
was
a
tradesman
and
i
suppose
every
one
of
my
readers
has
remarked
how
great
an
effect
a
title
has
on
the
lower
classes
yes
thank
heaven
there
is
about
a
freeborn
briton
a
cringing
baseness
and
lickspittle
awe
of
rank
which
does
not
exist
under
any
tyranny
in
europe
and
is
only
to
be
found
here
and
in
america
all
these
negotiations
had
been
going
on
quite
unknown
to
cat
and
as
the
captain
had
determined
before
two
months
were
out
to
fling
that
young
woman
on
the
pave
he
was
kind
to
her
in
the
meanwhile
people
always
are
when
they
are
swindling
you
or
meditating
an
injury
against
you
the
poor
girl
had
much
too
high
an
opinion
of
her
own
charms
to
suspect
that
the
count
could
be
unfaithful
to
them
and
had
no
notion
of
the
plot
that
was
formed
against
her
but
brock
had
for
he
had
seen
many
times
a
gilt
coach
with
a
pair
of
fat
white
horses
ambling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
and
the
captain
on
his
black
steed
caracolling
majestically
by
its
side
and
he
had
remarked
a
fat
pudgy
woman
treading
heavily
down
the
stairs
of
the
assembly
leaning
on
the
captain
arm
all
these
brock
had
seen
not
without
reflection
indeed
the
count
one
day
in
great
had
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
told
him
that
he
was
about
speedily
to
purchase
a
regiment
when
by
his
great
gods
brock
should
have
a
pair
of
colours
perhaps
this
promise
occasioned
his
silence
to
catherine
hitherto
perhaps
he
never
would
have
peached
at
all
and
perhaps
therefore
this
history
would
never
have
been
written
but
for
a
small
circumstance
which
occurred
at
this
period
what
can
you
want
with
that
drunken
old
corporal
always
about
your
quarters
said
trippet
to
the
count
one
day
as
they
sat
over
their
wine
in
the
midst
of
a
merry
company
at
the
captain
rooms
what
said
he
old
brock
the
old
thief
has
been
more
useful
to
me
than
many
a
better
man
he
is
as
brave
in
a
row
as
a
lion
as
cunning
in
intrigue
as
a
fox
he
can
nose
a
dun
at
an
inconceivable
distance
and
scent
out
a
pretty
woman
be
she
behind
ever
so
many
stone
walls
if
a
gentleman
wants
a
good
rascal
now
i
can
recommend
him
i
am
going
to
reform
you
know
and
must
turn
him
out
of
my
and
pretty
cat
oh
curse
pretty
cat
she
may
go
and
the
brat
why
you
have
parishes
and
what
not
here
in
england
egad
if
a
gentleman
were
called
upon
to
keep
all
his
children
there
would
be
no
living
no
stap
my
vitals
croesus
could
stand
no
indeed
said
trippet
you
are
right
and
when
a
gentleman
marries
he
is
bound
in
honour
to
give
up
such
low
connections
as
are
useful
when
he
is
a
of
course
and
give
them
up
i
will
when
the
sweet
dripping
is
mine
as
for
the
girl
you
can
have
her
tom
trippet
if
you
take
a
fancy
to
her
and
as
for
the
corporal
he
may
be
handed
over
to
my
successor
in
cutts
for
i
will
have
a
regiment
to
myself
that
poz
and
to
take
with
me
such
a
swindling
pimping
thieving
rascal
as
this
brock
will
never
do
egad
he
a
disgrace
to
the
service
as
it
is
i
often
a
mind
to
have
the
superannuated
vagabond
drummed
out
of
the
although
this
resume
of
brock
character
and
accomplishments
was
very
just
it
came
perhaps
with
an
ill
grace
from
count
gustavus
adolphus
maximilian
who
had
profited
by
all
his
qualities
and
who
certainly
would
never
have
given
this
opinion
of
them
had
he
known
that
the
door
of
his
was
open
and
that
the
gallant
corporal
who
was
in
the
passage
could
hear
every
syllable
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
his
commanding
officer
we
shall
not
say
after
the
fashion
of
the
that
brock
listened
with
a
flashing
eye
and
a
distended
nostril
that
his
chest
heaved
tumultuously
and
that
his
hand
fell
down
mechanically
to
his
side
where
it
played
with
the
brass
handle
of
his
sword
kean
would
have
gone
through
most
of
these
bodily
exercises
had
he
been
acting
the
part
of
a
villain
enraged
and
disappointed
like
corporal
brock
but
that
gentleman
walked
away
without
any
gestures
of
any
kind
and
as
gently
as
possible
he
turn
me
out
of
the
regiment
will
he
says
he
quite
piano
and
then
added
con
molta
espressione
i
do
for
and
it
is
to
be
remarked
how
generally
in
cases
of
this
nature
gentlemen
stick
to
their
word
chapter
iii
in
which
a
narcotic
is
administered
and
a
great
deal
of
genteel
society
depicted
when
the
corporal
who
had
retreated
to
the
immediately
on
hearing
the
above
conversation
returned
to
the
captain
lodgings
and
paid
his
respects
to
catherine
he
found
that
lady
in
high
the
count
had
been
with
her
she
said
along
with
a
friend
of
his
trippet
had
promised
her
twelve
yards
of
the
lace
she
coveted
so
much
had
vowed
that
the
child
should
have
as
much
more
for
a
cloak
and
had
not
left
her
until
he
had
sat
with
her
for
an
hour
or
more
over
a
bowl
of
punch
which
he
made
on
purpose
for
her
trippet
stayed
too
a
mighty
pleasant
man
said
she
only
not
very
wise
and
seemingly
a
good
deal
in
a
good
deal
indeed
said
the
corporal
he
was
so
tipsy
just
now
that
he
could
hardly
stand
he
and
his
honour
were
talking
to
nan
fantail
in
the
and
she
pulled
trippet
wig
off
for
wanting
to
kiss
the
nasty
fellow
said
cat
to
demean
himself
with
such
low
people
as
nan
fantail
indeed
why
upon
my
conscience
now
corporal
it
was
but
an
hour
ago
that
trippet
swore
he
never
saw
such
a
pair
of
eyes
as
mine
and
would
like
to
cut
the
captain
throat
for
the
love
of
me
nan
fantail
indeed
nan
an
honest
girl
madam
catherine
and
was
a
great
favourite
of
the
captain
before
someone
else
came
in
his
way
no
one
can
say
a
word
against
her
not
a
and
pray
corporal
who
ever
did
said
cat
rather
offended
a
nasty
ugly
slut
i
wonder
what
the
men
can
see
in
her
she
has
got
a
smart
way
with
her
sure
enough
it
what
amuses
the
men
and
and
what
you
do
mean
to
say
that
my
max
is
fond
of
her
now
said
catherine
looking
very
fierce
oh
no
not
at
all
not
of
her
that
is
not
of
her
screamed
she
of
whom
then
oh
psha
nonsense
of
you
my
dear
to
be
sure
who
else
should
he
care
for
and
besides
what
business
is
it
of
mine
and
herewith
the
corporal
began
whistling
as
if
he
would
have
no
more
of
the
conversation
but
cat
was
not
to
be
satisfied
not
she
and
carried
on
her
why
look
you
said
the
corporal
after
parrying
many
of
these
why
look
you
i
an
old
fool
catherine
and
i
must
blab
that
man
has
been
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
and
so
i
was
quiet
but
i
ca
keep
it
in
any
longer
no
hang
me
if
i
can
it
my
belief
he
acting
like
a
rascal
by
you
he
deceives
you
catherine
he
a
scoundrel
hall
that
the
truth
catherine
prayed
him
to
tell
all
he
knew
and
he
resumed
he
wants
you
off
his
hands
he
sick
of
you
and
so
brought
here
that
fool
tom
trippet
who
has
taken
a
fancy
to
you
he
has
not
the
courage
to
turn
you
out
of
doors
like
a
man
though
indoors
he
can
treat
you
like
a
beast
but
i
tell
you
what
he
do
in
a
month
he
will
go
to
coventry
or
pretend
to
go
there
on
recruiting
business
no
such
thing
hall
he
going
on
marriage
business
and
he
leave
you
without
a
farthing
to
starve
or
to
rot
for
him
it
all
arranged
i
tell
you
in
a
month
you
are
to
be
starved
into
becoming
tom
mistress
and
his
honour
is
to
marry
rich
miss
dripping
the
from
london
and
to
purchase
a
regiment
and
to
get
old
brock
drummed
out
of
cutts
too
said
the
corporal
under
his
breath
but
he
might
have
spoken
out
if
he
chose
for
the
poor
young
woman
had
sunk
on
the
ground
in
a
real
honest
fit
i
thought
i
should
give
it
her
said
brock
as
he
procured
a
glass
of
water
and
lifting
her
on
to
a
sofa
sprinkled
the
same
over
her
hang
it
how
pretty
she
when
catherine
came
to
herself
again
brock
tone
with
her
was
kind
and
almost
feeling
nor
did
the
poor
wench
herself
indulge
in
any
subsequent
shiverings
and
hysterics
such
as
usually
follow
the
of
persons
of
higher
degree
she
pressed
him
for
further
explanations
which
he
gave
and
to
which
she
listened
with
a
great
deal
of
calmness
nor
did
many
tears
sobs
sighs
or
exclamations
of
sorrow
or
anger
escape
from
her
only
when
the
corporal
was
taking
his
leave
and
said
to
her
well
catherine
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
she
did
not
reply
a
word
but
gave
a
look
which
made
him
exclaim
on
leaving
the
room
by
heavens
the
woman
means
murder
i
would
not
be
the
holofernes
to
lie
by
the
side
of
such
a
judith
as
that
not
i
and
he
went
his
way
immersed
in
deep
thought
when
the
captain
returned
at
night
she
did
not
speak
to
him
and
when
he
swore
at
her
for
being
sulky
she
only
said
she
had
a
headache
and
was
dreadfully
ill
with
which
excuse
gustavus
adolphus
seemed
satisfied
and
left
her
to
herself
he
saw
her
the
next
morning
for
a
moment
he
was
going
catherine
had
no
friend
as
is
usual
in
tragedies
and
romances
no
mysterious
sorceress
of
her
acquaintance
to
whom
she
could
apply
for
poison
so
she
went
simply
to
the
apothecaries
pretending
at
each
that
she
had
a
dreadful
toothache
and
procuring
from
them
as
much
laudanum
as
she
thought
would
suit
her
purpose
when
she
went
home
again
she
seemed
almost
gay
brock
complimented
her
upon
the
alteration
in
her
appearance
and
she
was
enabled
to
receive
the
captain
at
his
return
from
shooting
in
such
a
manner
as
made
him
remark
that
she
had
got
rid
of
her
sulks
of
the
morning
and
might
sup
with
them
if
she
chose
to
keep
her
the
supper
was
got
ready
and
the
gentlemen
had
the
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
catherine
with
her
delicate
hands
preparing
the
liquor
it
is
useless
to
describe
the
conversation
that
took
place
or
to
reckon
the
number
of
bowls
that
were
emptied
or
to
tell
how
trippet
who
was
one
of
the
guests
and
declined
to
play
at
cards
when
some
of
the
others
began
chose
to
remain
by
catherine
side
and
make
violent
love
to
her
all
this
might
be
told
and
the
account
however
faithful
would
not
be
very
pleasing
no
indeed
and
here
though
we
are
only
in
the
third
chapter
of
this
history
we
feel
almost
sick
of
the
characters
that
appear
in
it
and
the
adventures
which
they
are
called
upon
to
go
through
but
how
can
we
help
ourselves
the
public
will
hear
of
nothing
but
rogues
and
the
only
way
in
which
poor
authors
who
must
live
can
act
honestly
by
the
public
and
themselves
is
to
paint
such
thieves
as
they
are
not
dandy
poetical
thieves
but
real
downright
scoundrels
leading
scoundrelly
lives
drunken
profligate
dissolute
low
as
scoundrels
will
be
they
do
quote
plato
like
eugene
aram
or
live
like
gentlemen
and
sing
the
pleasantest
ballads
in
the
world
like
jolly
dick
turpin
or
prate
eternally
about
to
kalon
like
that
precious
canting
maltravers
whom
we
all
of
us
have
read
about
and
pitied
or
die
whitewashed
saints
like
poor
biss
dadsy
in
oliver
no
my
dear
madam
you
and
your
daughters
have
no
right
to
admire
and
sympathise
with
any
such
persons
fictitious
or
real
you
ought
to
be
made
cordially
to
detest
scorn
loathe
abhor
and
abominate
all
people
of
this
kidney
men
of
genius
like
those
whose
works
we
have
above
alluded
to
have
no
business
to
make
these
characters
interesting
or
agreeable
to
be
feeding
your
morbid
fancies
or
indulging
their
own
with
such
monstrous
food
for
our
parts
young
ladies
we
beg
you
to
bottle
up
your
tears
and
not
waste
a
single
drop
of
them
on
any
one
of
the
heroes
or
heroines
in
this
history
they
are
all
rascals
every
soul
of
them
and
behave
as
keep
your
sympathy
for
those
who
deserve
it
do
carry
it
for
preference
to
the
old
bailey
and
grow
maudlin
over
the
company
assembled
there
anglicised
version
of
the
author
original
greek
text
just
then
have
the
kindness
to
fancy
that
the
conversation
which
took
place
over
the
bowls
of
punch
which
catherine
prepared
was
such
as
might
be
expected
to
take
place
where
the
host
was
a
dissolute
libertine
captain
of
dragoons
the
guests
for
the
most
part
of
the
same
class
and
the
hostess
a
young
woman
originally
from
a
country
alehouse
and
for
the
present
mistress
to
the
entertainer
of
the
society
they
talked
and
they
drank
and
they
grew
tipsy
and
very
little
worth
hearing
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
whole
evening
brock
officiated
half
as
the
servant
half
as
the
companion
of
the
society
thomas
trippet
made
violent
love
to
catherine
while
her
lord
and
master
was
playing
at
dice
with
the
other
gentlemen
and
on
this
night
strange
to
say
the
captain
fortune
seemed
to
desert
him
the
warwickshire
squire
from
whom
he
had
won
so
much
had
an
amazing
run
of
good
luck
the
captain
called
perpetually
for
more
drink
and
higher
stakes
and
lost
almost
every
throw
three
hundred
four
hundred
six
hundred
all
his
winnings
of
the
previous
months
were
swallowed
up
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
the
corporal
looked
on
and
to
do
him
justice
seemed
very
grave
as
sum
by
sum
the
squire
scored
down
the
count
losses
on
the
paper
before
him
most
of
the
company
had
taken
their
hats
and
staggered
off
the
squire
and
trippet
were
the
only
two
that
remained
the
latter
still
lingering
by
catherine
sofa
and
table
and
as
she
as
we
have
stated
had
been
employed
all
the
evening
in
mixing
the
liquor
for
the
gamesters
he
was
at
the
headquarters
of
love
and
drink
and
had
swallowed
so
much
of
each
as
hardly
to
be
able
to
speak
the
dice
went
rattling
on
the
candles
were
burning
dim
with
great
long
wicks
trippet
could
hardly
see
the
captain
and
thought
as
far
as
his
muzzy
reason
would
let
him
that
the
captain
could
not
see
him
so
he
rose
from
his
chair
as
well
as
he
could
and
fell
down
on
catherine
sofa
his
eyes
were
fixed
his
face
was
pale
his
jaw
hung
down
and
he
flung
out
his
arms
and
said
in
a
maudlin
voice
oh
you
cathrine
i
must
have
a
beast
said
catherine
and
pushed
him
away
the
drunken
wretch
fell
off
the
sofa
and
on
to
the
floor
where
he
stayed
and
after
snorting
out
some
unintelligible
sounds
went
to
sleep
the
dice
went
rattling
on
the
candles
were
burning
dim
with
great
long
wicks
seven
the
main
cried
the
count
four
three
to
two
against
the
ponies
said
the
warwickshire
squire
rattle
rattle
rattle
rattle
clatter
nine
clap
clap
clap
clap
eleven
clutter
clutter
clutter
clutter
seven
it
is
says
the
warwickshire
squire
that
makes
eight
hundred
one
throw
for
two
hundred
said
the
count
but
stop
cat
give
us
some
more
cat
came
forward
she
looked
a
little
pale
and
her
hand
trembled
somewhat
here
is
the
punch
max
said
she
it
was
steaming
hot
in
a
large
glass
do
drink
it
all
said
she
leave
me
how
dark
it
is
said
the
count
eyeing
it
it
the
brandy
said
cat
well
here
goes
squire
curse
you
here
your
health
and
bad
luck
to
you
and
he
gulped
off
more
than
half
the
liquor
at
a
draught
but
presently
he
put
down
the
glass
and
cried
what
infernal
poison
is
this
cat
poison
said
she
it
no
poison
give
me
the
and
she
pledged
max
and
drank
a
little
of
it
is
good
punch
max
and
of
my
brewing
i
do
think
you
will
ever
get
any
and
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
again
and
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
players
brock
looked
at
her
white
face
and
fixed
eyes
with
a
grim
kind
of
curiosity
the
count
sputtered
and
cursed
the
horrid
taste
of
the
punch
still
but
he
presently
took
the
box
and
made
his
threatened
throw
as
before
the
squire
beat
him
and
having
booked
his
winnings
rose
from
table
as
well
as
he
might
and
besought
to
lead
him
downstairs
which
brock
did
liquor
had
evidently
stupefied
the
count
he
sat
with
his
head
between
his
hands
muttering
wildly
about
seven
the
main
bad
punch
and
so
on
the
banged
to
and
the
steps
of
brock
and
the
squire
were
heard
until
they
could
be
heard
no
more
max
said
she
but
he
did
not
answer
max
said
she
again
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
curse
you
said
that
gentleman
keep
off
and
do
be
laying
your
paws
upon
me
go
to
bed
you
jade
or
to
for
what
i
care
and
give
me
first
some
more
punch
a
gallon
more
punch
do
you
hear
the
gentleman
by
the
curses
at
the
commencement
of
this
little
speech
and
the
request
contained
at
the
end
of
it
showed
that
his
losses
vexed
him
and
that
he
was
anxious
to
forget
them
temporarily
oh
max
whimpered
cat
you
do
want
any
more
punch
do
sha
i
be
drunk
in
my
own
house
you
cursed
whimpering
jade
you
get
out
and
with
this
the
captain
proceeded
to
administer
a
blow
upon
catherine
cheek
contrary
to
her
custom
she
did
not
avenge
it
or
seek
to
do
so
as
on
the
many
former
occasions
when
disputes
of
this
nature
had
arisen
between
the
count
and
her
but
now
catherine
fell
on
her
knees
and
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
pitifully
in
the
count
face
cried
oh
count
forgive
me
forgive
me
forgive
you
what
for
because
i
slapped
your
face
ha
ha
forgive
you
again
if
you
do
oh
no
no
no
said
she
wringing
her
hands
it
is
that
max
dear
max
will
you
forgive
me
it
is
the
blow
i
do
mind
that
it
it
what
you
maudlin
fool
it
the
punch
the
count
who
was
more
than
half
seas
over
here
assumed
an
air
of
much
tipsy
gravity
the
punch
no
i
never
will
forgive
you
that
last
glass
of
punch
of
all
the
foul
beastly
drinks
i
ever
tasted
that
was
the
worst
no
i
never
will
forgive
you
that
oh
it
is
that
it
is
that
said
she
i
tell
you
it
is
that
you
that
punch
i
say
that
punch
was
no
better
than
paw
and
here
the
count
head
sank
back
and
he
fell
to
snore
it
was
poison
said
she
what
screamed
he
waking
up
at
once
and
spurning
her
away
from
him
what
you
infernal
murderess
have
you
killed
me
oh
max
do
kill
me
max
it
was
laudanum
indeed
it
was
you
were
going
to
be
married
and
i
was
furious
and
i
went
and
got
hold
your
tongue
you
fiend
roared
out
the
count
and
with
more
presence
of
mind
than
politeness
he
flung
the
remainder
of
the
liquor
and
indeed
the
glass
with
it
at
the
head
of
catherine
but
the
poisoned
chalice
missed
its
mark
and
fell
right
on
the
nose
of
tom
trippet
who
was
left
asleep
and
unobserved
under
the
table
bleeding
staggering
swearing
indeed
a
ghastly
sight
up
sprang
trippet
and
drew
his
rapier
come
on
says
he
never
say
die
the
row
i
ready
for
a
dozen
of
and
he
made
many
blind
and
furious
passes
about
the
room
curse
you
we
die
together
shouted
the
count
as
he
too
pulled
out
his
toledo
and
sprang
at
catherine
help
murder
thieves
shrieked
she
save
me
trippet
save
me
and
she
placed
that
gentleman
between
herself
and
the
count
and
then
made
for
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
gained
it
and
bolted
it
out
of
the
way
trippet
roared
the
count
out
of
the
way
you
drunken
beast
i
murder
her
i
will
i
have
the
devil
and
here
he
gave
a
swinging
cut
at
trippet
sword
it
sent
the
weapon
whirling
clean
out
of
his
hand
and
through
a
window
into
the
street
take
my
life
then
said
trippet
i
drunk
but
i
a
man
and
damme
will
never
say
i
do
want
your
life
you
stupid
fool
hark
you
trippet
wake
and
be
sober
if
you
can
that
woman
has
heard
of
my
marriage
with
miss
twenty
thousand
pound
ejaculated
trippet
she
has
been
jealous
i
tell
you
and
poisoned
us
she
has
put
laudanum
into
the
what
in
my
punch
said
trippet
growing
quite
sober
and
losing
his
courage
o
lord
o
lord
do
stand
howling
there
but
run
for
a
doctor
is
our
only
and
away
ran
trippet
as
if
the
deuce
were
at
his
heels
the
count
had
forgotten
his
murderous
intentions
regarding
his
mistress
or
had
deferred
them
at
least
under
the
consciousness
of
his
own
pressing
danger
and
it
must
be
said
in
the
praise
of
a
man
who
had
fought
for
and
against
marlborough
and
tallard
that
his
courage
in
this
trying
and
novel
predicament
never
for
a
moment
deserted
him
but
that
he
showed
the
greatest
daring
as
well
as
ingenuity
in
meeting
and
averting
the
danger
he
flew
to
the
sideboard
where
were
the
relics
of
a
supper
and
seizing
the
mustard
and
salt
pots
and
a
bottle
of
oil
he
emptied
them
all
into
a
jug
into
which
he
further
poured
a
vast
quantity
of
hot
water
this
pleasing
mixture
he
then
without
a
hesitation
placed
to
his
lips
and
swallowed
as
much
of
it
as
nature
would
allow
him
but
when
he
had
imbibed
about
a
quart
the
anticipated
effect
was
produced
and
he
was
enabled
by
the
power
of
this
ingenious
extemporaneous
emetic
to
get
rid
of
much
of
the
poison
which
catherine
had
administered
to
him
he
was
employed
in
these
efforts
when
the
doctor
entered
along
with
brock
and
trippet
who
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
that
the
poisoned
punch
had
not
in
all
probability
been
given
to
him
he
was
recommended
to
take
some
of
the
count
mixture
as
a
precautionary
measure
but
this
he
refused
and
retired
home
leaving
the
count
under
charge
of
the
physician
and
his
faithful
corporal
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
what
further
remedies
were
employed
by
them
to
restore
the
captain
to
health
but
after
some
time
the
doctor
pronouncing
that
the
danger
was
he
hoped
averted
recommended
that
his
patient
should
be
put
to
bed
and
that
somebody
should
sit
by
him
which
brock
promised
to
do
that
will
murder
me
if
you
do
gasped
the
poor
count
you
must
turn
her
out
of
the
bedroom
or
break
open
the
door
if
she
refuses
to
let
you
and
this
step
was
found
to
be
necessary
for
after
shouting
many
times
and
in
vain
brock
found
a
small
iron
bar
indeed
he
had
the
instrument
for
many
days
in
his
pocket
and
forced
the
lock
the
room
was
empty
the
window
was
open
the
pretty
barmaid
of
the
bugle
had
fled
the
chest
said
the
count
is
the
chest
safe
the
corporal
flew
to
the
bed
under
which
it
was
screwed
and
looked
and
said
it
is
safe
thank
heaven
the
window
was
closed
the
captain
who
was
too
weak
to
stand
without
help
was
undressed
and
put
to
bed
the
corporal
sat
down
by
his
side
slumber
stole
over
the
eyes
of
the
patient
and
his
wakeful
nurse
marked
with
satisfaction
the
progress
of
the
beneficent
restorer
of
health
when
the
captain
awoke
as
he
did
some
time
afterwards
he
found
very
much
to
his
surprise
that
a
gag
had
been
placed
in
his
mouth
and
that
the
corporal
was
in
the
act
of
wheeling
his
bed
to
another
part
of
the
room
he
attempted
to
move
and
gave
utterance
to
such
unintelligible
sounds
as
could
issue
through
a
silk
handkerchief
if
your
honour
stirs
or
cries
out
in
the
least
i
will
cut
your
honour
throat
said
the
corporal
and
then
having
recourse
to
his
iron
bar
the
reader
will
now
see
why
he
was
provided
with
such
an
implement
for
he
had
been
meditating
this
coup
for
some
days
he
proceeded
first
to
attempt
to
burst
the
lock
of
the
little
iron
chest
in
which
the
count
kept
his
treasure
and
failing
in
this
to
unscrew
it
from
the
ground
which
operation
he
performed
satisfactorily
you
see
count
said
he
calmly
when
rogues
fall
out
there
the
deuce
to
pay
you
have
me
drummed
out
of
the
regiment
will
you
i
going
to
leave
it
of
my
own
accord
look

noble
captain
bon
repos
the
squire
will
be
with
you
pretty
early
in
the
morning
to
ask
for
the
money
you
owe
with
these
sarcastic
observations
brock
departed
not
by
the
window
as
catherine
had
done
but
by
the
door
quietly
and
so
into
the
street
and
when
the
next
morning
the
doctor
came
to
visit
his
patient
he
brought
with
him
a
story
how
at
the
dead
of
night
brock
had
roused
the
ostler
at
the
stables
where
the
captain
horses
were
kept
had
told
him
that
catherine
had
poisoned
the
count
and
had
run
off
with
a
thousand
pounds
and
how
he
and
all
lovers
of
justice
ought
to
scour
the
country
in
pursuit
of
the
criminal
for
this
end
brock
mounted
the
count
best
horse
that
very
animal
on
which
he
had
carried
away
catherine
and
thus
on
a
single
night
count
maximilian
had
lost
his
mistress
his
money
his
horse
his
corporal
and
was
very
near
losing
his
life
chapter
iv
in
which
catherine
becomes
an
honest
woman
again
in
this
woeful
plight
moneyless
wifeless
horseless
corporalless
with
a
gag
in
his
mouth
and
a
rope
round
his
body
are
we
compelled
to
leave
the
gallant
galgenstein
until
his
friends
and
the
progress
of
this
history
shall
deliver
him
from
his
durance
brock
adventures
on
the
captain
horse
must
likewise
be
pretermitted
for
it
is
our
business
to
follow
catherine
through
the
window
by
which
she
made
her
escape
and
among
the
various
chances
that
befell
her
she
had
one
cause
to
congratulate
herself
that
she
had
not
her
baby
at
her
back
for
the
infant
was
safely
housed
under
the
care
of
a
nurse
to
whom
the
captain
was
answerable
beyond
this
her
prospects
were
but
dismal
no
home
to
fly
to
but
a
few
shillings
in
her
pocket
and
a
whole
heap
of
injuries
and
dark
revengeful
thoughts
in
her
bosom
it
was
a
sad
task
to
her
to
look
either
backwards
or
forwards
whither
was
she
to
fly
how
to
live
what
good
chance
was
to
befriend
her
there
was
an
angel
watching
over
the
steps
of
cat
not
a
good
one
i
think
but
one
of
those
from
that
unnameable
place
who
have
their
many
subjects
here
on
earth
and
often
are
pleased
to
extricate
them
from
worse
perplexities
cat
now
had
not
committed
murder
but
as
bad
as
murder
and
as
she
felt
not
the
smallest
repentance
in
her
heart
as
she
had
in
the
course
of
her
life
and
connection
with
the
captain
performed
and
gloried
in
a
number
of
wicked
coquetries
idlenesses
vanities
lies
fits
of
anger
slanders
foul
abuses
and
what
not
she
was
fairly
bound
over
to
this
dark
angel
whom
we
have
alluded
to
and
he
dealt
with
her
and
aided
her
as
one
of
his
own
children
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
in
this
strait
he
appeared
to
her
in
the
likeness
of
a
gentleman
in
black
and
made
her
sign
her
name
in
blood
to
a
document
conveying
over
to
him
her
soul
in
exchange
for
certain
conditions
to
be
performed
by
him
such
diabolical
bargains
have
always
appeared
to
me
unworthy
of
the
astute
personage
who
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
parties
to
them
and
who
would
scarcely
be
fool
enough
to
pay
dearly
for
that
which
he
can
have
in
a
few
years
for
nothing
it
is
not
then
to
be
supposed
that
a
demon
of
darkness
appeared
to
cat
and
led
her
into
a
flaming
chariot
harnessed
by
dragons
and
careering
through
air
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
leagues
a
minute
no
such
thing
the
vehicle
that
was
sent
to
aid
her
was
one
of
a
much
more
vulgar
description
the
liverpool
carryvan
then
which
in
the
year
used
to
perform
the
journey
between
london
and
that
place
in
ten
days
left
birmingham
about
an
hour
after
catherine
had
quitted
that
town
and
as
she
sat
weeping
on
a
hillside
and
plunged
in
bitter
meditation
the
lumbering
jingling
vehicle
overtook
her
the
coachman
was
marching
by
the
side
of
his
horses
and
encouraging
them
to
maintain
their
pace
of
two
miles
an
hour
the
passengers
had
some
of
them
left
the
vehicle
in
order
to
walk
up
the
hill
and
the
carriage
had
arrived
at
the
top
of
it
and
meditating
a
brisk
trot
down
the
declivity
waited
there
until
the
lagging
passengers
should
arrive
when
jehu
casting
a
glance
upon
catherine
asked
the
pretty
maid
whence
she
was
come
and
whether
she
would
like
a
ride
in
his
carriage
to
the
latter
of
which
questions
catherine
replied
truly
yes
to
the
former
her
answer
was
that
she
had
come
from
stratford
whereas
as
we
very
well
know
she
had
lately
quitted
birmingham
hast
thee
seen
a
woman
pass
this
way
on
a
black
horse
with
a
large
bag
of
goold
over
the
saddle
said
jehu
preparing
to
mount
upon
the
roof
of
his
coach
no
indeed
said
cat
nor
a
trooper
on
another
horse
after
her
no
well
there
be
a
mortal
row
down
birmingham
way
about
sich
a
one
she
have
killed
they
say
nine
gentlemen
at
supper
and
have
strangled
a
german
prince
in
bed
she
have
robbed
him
of
twenty
thousand
guineas
and
have
rode
away
on
a
black
that
ca
be
i
said
cat
naively
for
i
have
but
three
shillings
and
a
no
it
ca
be
thee
truly
for
where
your
bag
of
goold
and
besides
thee
hast
got
too
pretty
a
face
to
do
such
wicked
things
as
to
kill
nine
gentlemen
and
strangle
a
german
law
coachman
said
cat
blushing
archly
law
coachman
do
you
think
so
the
girl
would
have
been
pleased
with
a
compliment
even
on
her
way
to
be
hanged
and
the
parley
ended
by
catherine
stepping
into
the
carriage
where
there
was
room
for
eight
people
at
least
and
where
two
or
three
individuals
had
already
taken
their
places
for
these
catherine
had
in
the
first
place
to
make
a
story
which
she
did
and
a
very
glib
one
for
a
person
of
her
years
and
education
being
asked
whither
she
was
bound
and
how
she
came
to
be
alone
of
a
morning
sitting
by
a
she
invented
a
neat
history
suitable
to
the
occasion
which
elicited
much
interest
from
her
one
in
particular
a
young
man
who
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
under
her
hood
was
very
tender
in
his
attentions
to
her
but
whether
it
was
that
she
had
been
too
much
fatigued
by
the
occurrences
of
the
past
day
and
sleepless
night
or
whether
the
little
laudanum
which
she
had
drunk
a
few
hours
previously
now
began
to
act
upon
her
certain
it
is
that
cat
now
suddenly
grew
sick
feverish
and
extraordinarily
sleepy
and
in
this
state
she
continued
for
many
hours
to
the
pity
of
all
her
at
length
the
carryvan
reached
the
inn
where
horses
and
passengers
were
accustomed
to
rest
for
a
few
hours
and
to
dine
and
catherine
was
somewhat
awakened
by
the
stir
of
the
passengers
and
the
friendly
voice
of
the
welcoming
them
to
dinner
the
gentleman
who
had
been
smitten
by
her
beauty
now
urged
her
very
politely
to
descend
which
taking
the
protection
of
his
arm
she
accordingly
did
he
made
some
very
gallant
speeches
to
her
as
she
stepped
out
and
she
must
have
been
very
much
occupied
by
them
or
wrapt
up
in
her
own
thoughts
or
stupefied
by
sleep
fever
and
opium
for
she
did
not
take
any
heed
of
the
place
into
which
she
was
going
which
had
she
done
she
would
probably
have
preferred
remaining
in
the
coach
dinnerless
and
ill
indeed
the
inn
into
which
she
was
about
to
make
her
entrance
was
no
other
than
the
bugle
from
which
she
set
forth
at
the
commencement
of
this
history
and
which
then
as
now
was
kept
by
her
relative
the
thrifty
mrs
score
that
good
landlady
seeing
a
lady
in
a
smart
hood
and
cloak
leaning
as
if
faint
upon
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
of
good
appearance
concluded
them
to
be
man
and
wife
and
folks
of
quality
too
and
with
much
discrimination
as
well
as
sympathy
led
them
through
the
public
kitchen
to
her
own
private
parlour
or
bar
where
she
handed
the
lady
an
armchair
and
asked
what
she
would
like
to
drink
by
this
time
and
indeed
at
the
very
moment
she
heard
her
aunt
voice
catherine
was
aware
of
her
situation
and
when
her
companion
retired
and
the
landlady
with
much
officiousness
insisted
on
removing
her
hood
she
was
quite
prepared
for
the
screech
of
surprise
which
mrs
score
gave
on
dropping
it
exclaiming
why
law
bless
us
it
our
catherine
i
very
ill
and
tired
aunt
said
cat
and
would
give
the
world
for
a
few
hours
a
few
hours
and
welcome
my
love
and
a
too
you
do
look
sadly
tired
and
poorly
sure
enough
ah
cat
cat
you
great
ladies
are
sad
rakes
i
do
believe
i
wager
now
that
with
all
your
balls
and
carriages
and
fine
clothes
you
are
neither
so
happy
nor
so
well
as
when
you
lived
with
your
poor
old
aunt
who
used
to
love
you
and
with
these
gentle
words
and
an
embrace
or
two
which
catherine
wondered
at
and
permitted
she
was
conducted
to
that
very
bed
which
the
count
had
occupied
a
year
previously
and
undressed
and
laid
in
it
and
affectionately
tucked
up
by
her
aunt
who
marvelled
at
the
fineness
of
her
clothes
as
she
removed
them
piece
by
piece
and
when
she
saw
that
in
catherine
pocket
there
was
only
the
sum
of
three
and
fourpence
said
archly
there
was
no
need
of
money
for
the
captain
took
care
of
cat
did
not
undeceive
her
and
deceived
mrs
score
certainly
was
for
she
imagined
the
gentleman
who
led
cat
from
the
carriage
was
no
other
than
the
count
and
as
she
had
heard
from
time
to
time
exaggerated
reports
of
the
splendour
of
the
establishment
which
he
kept
up
she
was
induced
to
look
upon
her
niece
with
the
very
highest
respect
and
to
treat
her
as
if
she
were
a
fine
lady
and
so
she
is
a
fine
lady
mrs
score
had
said
months
ago
when
some
of
these
flattering
stories
reached
her
and
she
had
overcome
her
first
fury
at
catherine
elopement
the
girl
was
very
cruel
to
leave
me
but
we
must
recollect
that
she
is
as
good
as
married
to
a
nobleman
and
must
all
forget
and
forgive
you
this
speech
had
been
made
to
doctor
dobbs
who
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
a
pipe
and
a
tankard
at
the
bugle
and
it
had
been
roundly
reprobated
by
the
worthy
divine
who
told
mrs
score
that
the
crime
of
catherine
was
only
the
more
heinous
if
it
had
been
committed
from
interested
motives
and
protested
that
were
she
a
princess
he
would
never
speak
to
her
again
mrs
score
thought
and
pronounced
the
opinion
to
be
very
bigoted
indeed
she
was
one
of
those
persons
who
have
a
marvellous
respect
for
prosperity
and
a
corresponding
scorn
for
when
therefore
she
returned
to
the
public
room
she
went
graciously
to
the
gentleman
who
had
led
catherine
from
the
carriage
and
with
a
knowing
curtsey
welcomed
him
to
the
bugle
told
him
that
his
lady
would
not
come
to
dinner
but
bade
her
say
with
her
best
love
to
his
lordship
that
the
ride
had
fatigued
her
and
that
she
would
lie
in
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
this
speech
was
received
with
much
wonder
by
his
lordship
who
was
indeed
no
other
than
a
liverpool
tailor
going
to
london
to
learn
fashions
but
he
only
smiled
and
did
not
undeceive
the
landlady
who
herself
went
off
smilingly
to
bustle
about
dinner
the
two
or
three
hours
allotted
to
that
meal
by
the
liberal
coachmasters
of
those
days
passed
away
and
coachman
declaring
that
his
horses
were
now
rested
enough
and
that
they
had
twelve
miles
to
ride
put
the
steeds
to
and
summoned
the
passengers
mrs
score
who
had
seen
with
much
satisfaction
that
her
niece
was
really
ill
and
her
fever
more
violent
and
hoped
to
have
her
for
many
days
an
inmate
in
her
house
now
came
forward
and
casting
upon
the
liverpool
tailor
a
look
of
profound
but
respectful
melancholy
said
my
lord
for
i
recollect
your
lordship
quite
well
the
lady
upstairs
is
so
ill
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
move
her
had
i
not
better
tell
coachman
to
take
down
your
lordship
trunks
and
the
lady
and
make
you
a
bed
in
the
next
room
very
much
to
her
surprise
this
proposition
was
received
with
a
roar
of
laughter
madam
said
the
person
addressed
i
not
a
lord
but
a
tailor
and
draper
and
as
for
that
young
woman
before
i
never
set
eyes
on
what
screamed
out
mrs
score
are
not
you
the
count
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
cat
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
did
order
her
bed
and
that
you
wo
pay
this
here
little
bill
and
with
this
she
produced
a
document
by
which
the
count
lady
was
made
her
debtor
in
a
sum
of
these
passionate
words
excited
more
and
more
laughter
pay
it
my
lord
said
the
coachman
and
then
come
along
for
time
our
respects
to
her
ladyship
said
one
passenger
tell
her
my
lord
wait
said
another
and
with
much
merriment
one
and
all
quitted
the
hotel
entered
the
coach
and
rattled
off
dumb
pale
with
terror
and
rage
bill
in
hand
mrs
score
had
followed
the
company
but
when
the
coach
disappeared
her
senses
returned
back
she
flew
into
the
inn
overturning
the
ostler
not
deigning
to
answer
doctor
dobbs
who
from
behind
soft
mildly
asked
the
reason
of
her
disturbance
and
bounding
upstairs
like
a
fury
she
rushed
into
the
room
where
catherine
lay
well
madam
said
she
in
her
highest
key
do
you
mean
that
you
have
come
into
this
here
house
to
swindle
me
do
you
dare
for
to
come
with
your
airs
here
and
call
yourself
a
nobleman
lady
and
sleep
in
the
best
bed
when
you
no
better
nor
a
common
tramper
i
thank
you
to
get
out
i
have
no
sick
paupers
in
this
house
you
know
your
way
to
the
workhouse
and
there
i
trouble
you
for
to
and
here
mrs
score
proceeded
quickly
to
pull
off
the
bedclothes
and
poor
cat
arose
shivering
with
fright
and
fever
she
had
no
spirit
to
answer
as
she
would
have
done
the
day
before
when
an
oath
from
any
human
being
would
have
brought
from
her
in
return
or
a
knife
or
a
plate
or
a
leg
of
mutton
if
such
had
been
to
her
hand
she
had
no
spirit
left
for
such
repartees
but
in
reply
to
the
above
words
of
mrs
score
and
a
great
many
more
of
the
same
kind
which
are
not
necessary
for
our
history
but
which
that
lady
uttered
with
inconceivable
shrillness
and
volubility
the
poor
wench
could
say
little
only
sob
and
shiver
and
gather
up
the
clothes
again
crying
oh
aunt
do
speak
unkind
to
me
i
very
unhappy
and
very
ill
ill
you
strumpet
ill
be
hanged
ill
is
as
ill
does
and
if
you
are
ill
it
only
what
you
merit
get
out
dress
yourself
tramp
get
to
the
workhouse
and
do
come
to
cheat
me
any
more
dress
yourself
do
you
hear
satin
petticoat
forsooth
and
lace
to
her
smock
poor
wretched
chattering
burning
shivering
catherine
huddled
on
her
clothes
as
well
she
might
she
seemed
hardly
to
know
or
see
what
she
was
doing
and
did
not
reply
a
single
word
to
the
many
that
the
landlady
let
fall
cat
tottered
down
the
narrow
stairs
and
through
the
kitchen
and
to
the
door
which
she
caught
hold
of
and
paused
awhile
and
looked
into
mrs
score
face
as
for
one
more
chance
get
out
you
nasty
trull
said
that
lady
sternly
with
arms
akimbo
and
poor
catherine
with
a
most
piteous
scream
and
outgush
of
tears
let
go
of
the
and
staggered
away
into
the
road
why
no
yes
no
it
is
poor
catherine
hall
as
i
live
said
somebody
starting
up
shoving
aside
mrs
score
very
rudely
and
running
into
the
road
wig
off
and
pipe
in
hand
it
was
honest
doctor
dobbs
and
the
result
of
his
interview
with
cat
was
that
he
gave
up
for
ever
smoking
his
pipe
at
the
bugle
and
that
she
lay
sick
of
a
fever
for
some
weeks
in
his
house
over
this
part
of
cat
history
we
shall
be
as
brief
as
possible
for
to
tell
the
truth
nothing
immoral
occurred
during
her
whole
stay
at
the
good
doctor
house
and
we
are
not
going
to
insult
the
reader
by
offering
him
silly
pictures
of
piety
cheerfulness
good
sense
and
simplicity
which
are
virtues
after
all
and
have
no
relish
with
them
like
a
good
strong
vice
highly
peppered
well
to
be
short
doctor
dobbs
though
a
profound
theologian
was
a
very
simple
gentleman
and
before
cat
had
been
a
month
in
the
house
he
had
learned
to
look
upon
her
as
one
of
the
most
injured
and
repentant
characters
in
the
world
and
had
with
dobbs
resolved
many
plans
for
the
future
welfare
of
the
young
magdalen
she
was
but
sixteen
my
love
recollect
said
the
doctor
she
was
carried
off
not
by
her
own
wish
either
the
count
swore
he
would
marry
her
and
though
she
did
not
leave
him
until
that
monster
tried
to
poison
her
yet
think
what
a
fine
christian
spirit
the
poor
girl
has
shown
she
forgives
him
as
heartily
more
heartily
i
am
sure
than
i
do
mrs
score
for
turning
her
adrift
in
that
wicked
the
reader
will
perceive
some
difference
in
the
doctor
statement
and
ours
which
we
assure
him
is
the
true
one
but
the
fact
is
the
honest
rector
had
had
his
tale
from
cat
and
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
doubt
if
she
had
told
him
a
history
ten
times
more
wonderful
the
reverend
gentleman
and
his
wife
then
laid
their
heads
together
and
recollecting
something
of
john
hayes
former
attachment
to
cat
thought
that
it
might
be
advantageously
renewed
should
hayes
be
still
constant
having
very
adroitly
sounded
catherine
so
adroitly
indeed
as
to
ask
her
whether
she
would
like
to
marry
john
hayes
that
young
woman
had
replied
no
she
had
loved
john
hayes
he
had
been
her
early
only
love
but
she
was
fallen
now
and
not
good
enough
for
and
this
made
the
dobbs
family
admire
her
more
and
more
and
cast
about
for
means
to
bring
the
marriage
to
pass
hayes
was
away
from
the
village
when
cat
had
arrived
there
but
he
did
not
fail
to
hear
of
her
illness
and
how
her
aunt
had
deserted
her
and
the
good
doctor
taken
her
in
the
worthy
doctor
himself
met
hayes
on
the
green
and
telling
him
that
some
repairs
were
wanting
in
his
kitchen
begged
him
to
step
in
and
examine
them
hayes
first
said
no
plump
and
then
no
gently
and
then
pished
and
then
psha
and
then
trembling
very
much
went
in
and
there
sat
catherine
trembling
very
much
too
what
passed
between
them
if
your
ladyship
is
anxious
to
know
think
of
that
morning
when
sir
john
himself
popped
the
question
could
there
be
anything
more
stupid
than
the
conversation
which
took
place
such
stuff
is
not
worth
repeating
no
not
when
uttered
by
people
in
the
very
genteelest
of
company
as
for
the
amorous
dialogue
of
a
carpenter
and
an
it
is
worse
still
suffice
it
to
say
that
hayes
who
had
had
a
year
to
recover
from
his
passion
and
had
to
all
appearances
quelled
it
was
over
head
and
ears
again
the
very
moment
he
saw
cat
and
had
all
his
work
to
do
again
whether
the
doctor
knew
what
was
going
on
i
ca
say
but
this
matter
is
certain
that
every
evening
hayes
was
now
in
the
rectory
kitchen
or
else
walking
abroad
with
catherine
and
whether
she
ran
away
with
him
or
he
with
her
i
shall
not
make
it
my
business
to
inquire
but
certainly
at
the
end
of
three
months
which
must
be
crowded
up
into
this
one
little
sentence
another
elopement
took
place
in
the
village
i
should
have
prevented
it
certainly
said
doctor
dobbs
whereat
his
wife
smiled
but
the
young
people
kept
the
matter
a
secret
from
and
so
he
would
had
he
known
it
but
though
dobbs
had
made
several
attempts
to
acquaint
him
with
the
precise
hour
and
method
of
the
intended
elopement
he
peremptorily
ordered
her
to
hold
her
tongue
the
fact
is
that
the
matter
had
been
discussed
by
the
rector
lady
many
times
young
hayes
would
she
say
has
a
pretty
little
fortune
and
trade
of
his
own
he
is
an
only
son
and
may
marry
as
he
likes
and
though
not
specially
handsome
generous
or
amiable
has
an
undeniable
love
for
cat
who
you
know
must
not
be
particular
and
the
sooner
she
marries
him
i
think
the
better
they
ca
be
married
at
our
church
you
know
and
well
said
the
doctor
if
they
are
married
elsewhere
i
ca
help
it
and
know
nothing
about
it
look
and
upon
this
hint
the
elopement
took
place
which
indeed
was
peaceably
performed
early
one
sunday
morning
about
a
month
after
hall
getting
behind
hayes
on
a
pillion
and
all
the
children
of
the
parsonage
giggling
behind
the
to
see
the
pair
go
off
during
this
month
hayes
had
caused
the
banns
to
be
published
at
the
town
of
worcester
judging
rightly
that
in
a
great
town
they
would
cause
no
such
remark
as
in
a
solitary
village
and
thither
he
conducted
his
lady
o
john
hayes
whither
do
the
dark
fates
lead
you
o
foolish
doctor
dobbs
to
forget
that
young
people
ought
to
honour
their
parents
and
to
yield
to
silly
dobbs
ardent
propensity
for
making
matches
the
london
gazette
of
the
april
contains
a
proclamation
by
the
queen
for
putting
into
execution
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
encouragement
and
increase
of
seamen
and
for
the
better
and
speedier
manning
of
her
majesty
fleet
which
authorises
all
justices
to
issue
warrants
to
constables
petty
constables
headboroughs
and
to
enter
and
if
need
be
to
break
open
the
doors
of
any
houses
where
they
shall
believe
deserting
seamen
to
be
and
for
the
further
increase
and
encouragement
of
the
navy
to
take
landsmen
when
seamen
fail
this
act
which
occupies
four
columns
of
the
gazette
and
another
of
similar
length
and
meaning
for
pressing
men
into
the
army
need
not
be
quoted
at
length
here
but
caused
a
mighty
stir
throughout
the
kingdom
at
the
time
when
it
was
in
force
as
one
has
seen
or
heard
after
the
march
of
a
great
army
a
number
of
rogues
and
loose
characters
bring
up
the
rear
in
like
manner
at
the
tail
of
a
great
measure
of
state
follow
many
roguish
personal
interests
which
are
protected
by
the
main
body
the
great
measure
of
reform
for
instance
carried
along
with
it
much
private
jobbing
and
swindling
as
could
be
shown
were
we
not
inclined
to
deal
mildly
with
the
whigs
and
this
enlistment
act
which
in
order
to
maintain
the
british
glories
in
flanders
dealt
most
cruelly
with
the
british
people
in
england
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
a
man
has
been
pinched
at
home
to
make
a
fine
appearance
abroad
created
a
great
company
of
rascals
and
informers
throughout
the
land
who
lived
upon
it
or
upon
extortion
from
those
who
were
subject
to
it
or
not
being
subject
to
it
were
frightened
into
the
belief
that
they
were
when
hayes
and
his
lady
had
gone
through
the
marriage
ceremony
at
worcester
the
former
concluding
that
at
such
a
place
lodging
and
food
might
be
procured
at
a
cheaper
rate
looked
about
carefully
for
the
meanest
in
the
town
where
he
might
deposit
his
bride
in
the
kitchen
of
this
inn
a
party
of
men
were
drinking
and
as
hayes
declined
with
a
proper
sense
of
her
superiority
to
eat
in
company
with
such
low
fellows
the
landlady
showed
her
and
her
husband
to
an
inner
apartment
where
they
might
be
served
in
private
the
kitchen
party
seemed
indeed
not
such
as
a
lady
would
choose
to
join
there
was
one
huge
lanky
fellow
that
looked
like
a
soldier
and
had
a
halberd
another
was
habited
in
a
sailor
costume
with
a
fascinating
patch
over
one
eye
and
a
third
who
seemed
the
leader
of
the
gang
was
a
stout
man
in
a
sailor
frock
and
a
whom
one
might
fancy
if
he
were
anything
to
be
a
of
one
of
these
worthies
hayes
thought
she
knew
the
figure
and
voice
and
she
found
her
conjectures
were
true
when
all
of
sudden
three
people
without
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
burst
into
the
room
into
which
she
and
her
spouse
had
retired
at
their
head
was
no
other
than
her
old
friend
peter
brock
he
had
his
sword
drawn
and
his
finger
to
his
lips
enjoining
silence
as
it
were
to
catherine
he
with
the
patch
on
his
eye
seized
incontinently
on
hayes
the
tall
man
with
the
halberd
kept
the
door
two
or
three
heroes
supported
the
man
who
with
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
down
with
your
arms
no
resistance
you
are
my
prisoner
in
the
name
and
here
at
this
lock
we
shall
leave
the
whole
company
until
the
next
chapter
which
may
possibly
explain
what
they
were
chapter
contains
brock
autobiography
and
other
matters
you
do
sure
believe
these
men
said
hayes
as
soon
as
the
first
alarm
caused
by
the
irruption
of
brock
and
his
companions
had
subsided
these
are
no
magistrate
men
it
is
but
a
trick
to
rob
you
of
your
money
i
will
never
give
up
a
farthing
of
it
screamed
hayes
yonder
fellow
continued
catherine
i
know
for
all
his
drawn
sword
and
fierce
looks
his
name
is
wood
madam

your
service
said
brock
i
am
follower
to
justice
gobble
of
this
town

tim
said
brock
to
the
tall
halberdman
who
was
keeping
the
door

tim
archly
we
all
followers
of
his
honour
justice

said
the
man
of
course
cried
the
man
in
the
nightcap
i
suppose
madam
you
satisfied
now
continued
brock
alias
wood
you
ca
deny
the
testimony
of
gentlemen
like
these
and
our
commission
is
to
apprehend
all
male
persons
who
can
give
no
good
account
of
themselves
and
enrol
them
in
the
service
of
her
majesty
look
at
this
hayes
who
stood
trembling
in
his
shoes
can
there
be
a
bolder
properer
straighter
gentleman
we
have
him
for
a
grenadier
before
the
day
over
take
heart
john
do
be
frightened
psha
i
tell
you
i
know
the
man
cried
out
hayes
he
is
only
here
to
extort
oh

that
matter
i
do
think
i
recollect
the
lady
let
me
see
where
was
it
at
birmingham
i
think
ay
at
birmingham
about
the
time
when
they
tried
to
murder
count
gal
oh
sir
here
cried
madam
hayes
dropping
her
voice
at
once
from
a
tone
of
scorn
to
one
of
gentlest
entreaty
what
is
it
you
want
with
my
husband
i
know
not
indeed
if
ever
i
saw
you
before
for
what
do
you
seize
him
how
much
will
you
take
to
release
him
and
let
us
go
name
the
sum
he
is
rich
and
rich
catherine
cried
hayes
rich
o
heavens
sir
i
have
nothing
but
my
hands
to
support
me
i
am
a
poor
carpenter
sir
working
under
my
father
he
can
give
twenty
guineas
to
be
free
i
know
he
can
said
cat
i
have
but
a
guinea
to
carry
me
home
sighed
out
hayes
but
you
have
twenty
at
home
john
said
his
wife
give
these
brave
gentlemen
a
writing
to
your
mother
and
she
will
pay
and
you
will
let
us
free
then
gentlemen
wo
you
when
the
money
paid
yes
said
the
leader
brock
oh
in
course
echoed
the
tall
man
with
the
halberd
what
a
thrifling
detintion
my
dear
continued
he
addressing
hayes
amuse
you
in
your
absence
and
drink
to
the
health
of
your
pretty
wife
this
promise
to
do
the
halberdier
justice
he
fulfilled
he
called
upon
the
landlady
to
produce
the
desired
liquor
and
when
hayes
flung
himself
at
that
lady
feet
demanding
succour
from
her
and
asking
whether
there
was
no
law
in
the
land
there
no
law
at
the
rooks
except
this
said
brock
in
reply
holding
up
a
to
which
the
hostess
grinning
assented
and
silently
went
her
way
after
some
further
solicitations
john
hayes
drew
out
the
necessary
letter
to
his
father
stating
that
he
was
pressed
and
would
not
be
set
free
under
a
sum
of
twenty
guineas
and
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
detain
the
bearer
of
the
letter
inasmuch
as
the
gentlemen
who
had
possession
of
him
vowed
that
they
would
murder
him
should
any
harm
befall
their
comrade
as
a
further
proof
of
the
authenticity
of
the
letter
a
token
was
added
a
ring
that
hayes
wore
and
that
his
mother
had
given
him
the
missives
were
after
some
consultation
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
tall
halberdier
who
seemed
to
rank
as
second
in
command
of
the
forces
that
marched
under
corporal
brock
this
gentleman
was
called
indifferently
ensign
or
even
captain
macshane
his
intimates
occasionally
in
sport
called
him
nosey
from
the
prominence
of
that
feature
in
his
countenance
or
spindleshins
for
the
very
reason
which
brought
on
the
first
edward
a
similar
nickname
macshane
then
quitted
worcester
mounted
on
hayes
horse
leaving
all
parties
at
the
three
rooks
not
a
little
anxious
for
his
return
this
was
not
to
be
expected
until
the
next
morning
and
a
weary
nuit
de
noces
did
hayes
pass
dinner
was
served
and
according
to
promise
brock
and
his
two
friends
enjoyed
the
meal
along
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
punch
followed
and
this
was
taken
in
company
then
came
supper
brock
alone
partook
of
this
the
other
two
gentlemen
preferring
the
society
of
their
pipes
and
the
landlady
in
the
kitchen
it
is
a
sorry
entertainment
i
confess
said
the
and
a
dismal
way
for
a
gentleman
to
spend
his
bridal
night
but
somebody
must
stay
with
you
my
dears
for
who
knows
but
you
might
take
a
fancy
to
scream
out
of
window
and
then
there
would
be
murder
and
the
deuce
and
all
to
pay
one
of
us
must
stay
and
my
friends
love
a
pipe
so
you
must
put
up
with
my
company
until
they
can
relieve
the
reader
will
not
of
course
expect
that
three
people
who
were
to
pass
the
night
however
unwillingly
together
in
an
should
sit
there
dumb
and
moody
and
without
any
personal
communication
on
the
contrary
brock
as
an
old
soldier
entertained
his
prisoners
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
did
all
that
lay
in
his
power
by
the
help
of
liquor
and
conversation
to
render
their
durance
tolerable
on
the
bridegroom
his
attentions
were
a
good
deal
thrown
away
hayes
consented
to
drink
copiously
but
could
not
be
made
to
talk
much
and
in
fact
the
fright
of
the
seizure
the
fate
hanging
over
him
should
his
parents
refuse
a
ransom
and
the
tremendous
outlay
of
money
which
would
take
place
should
they
accede
to
it
weighed
altogether
on
his
mind
so
much
as
utterly
to
unman
it
as
for
cat
i
do
think
she
was
at
all
sorry
in
her
heart
to
see
the
old
corporal
for
he
had
been
a
friend
of
old
times
dear
times
to
her
she
had
had
from
him
too
and
felt
for
him
not
a
little
kindness
and
there
was
really
a
very
tender
innocent
friendship
subsisting
between
this
pair
of
rascals
who
relished
much
a
night
conversation
together
the
corporal
after
treating
his
prisoners
to
punch
in
great
quantities
proposed
the
amusement
of
cards
over
which
hayes
had
not
been
occupied
more
than
an
hour
when
he
found
himself
so
excessively
sleepy
as
to
be
persuaded
to
fling
himself
down
on
the
bed
dressed
as
he
was
and
there
to
snore
away
until
morning
catherine
had
no
inclination
for
sleep
and
the
corporal
equally
wakeful
plied
incessantly
the
bottle
and
held
with
her
a
great
deal
of
conversation
the
sleep
which
was
equivalent
to
the
absence
of
john
hayes
took
all
restraint
from
their
talk
she
explained
to
brock
the
circumstances
of
her
marriage
which
we
have
already
described
they
wondered
at
the
chance
which
had
brought
them
together
at
the
three
rooks
nor
did
brock
at
all
hesitate
to
tell
her
at
once
that
his
calling
was
quite
illegal
and
that
his
intention
was
simply
to
extort
money
the
worthy
corporal
had
not
the
slightest
shame
regarding
his
own
profession
and
cut
many
jokes
with
cat
about
her
late
one
her
attempt
to
murder
the
count
and
her
future
prospects
as
a
wife
and
here
having
brought
him
upon
the
scene
again
we
may
as
well
shortly
narrate
some
of
the
principal
circumstances
which
befell
him
after
his
sudden
departure
from
birmingham
and
which
he
narrated
with
much
candour
to
catherine
he
rode
the
captain
horse
to
oxford
having
exchanged
his
military
dress
for
a
civil
costume
on
the
road
and
at
oxford
he
disposed
of
george
of
denmark
a
great
bargain
to
one
of
the
heads
of
colleges
as
soon
as
brock
who
took
on
himself
the
style
and
title
of
captain
wood
had
sufficiently
examined
the
curiosities
of
the
university
he
proceeded
at
once
to
the
capital
the
only
place
for
a
gentleman
of
his
fortune
and
figure
here
he
read
with
a
great
deal
of
philosophical
indifference
in
the
daily
post
the
courant
the
observator
the
gazette
and
the
chief
journals
of
those
days
which
he
made
a
point
of
examining
at
button
and
will
an
accurate
description
of
his
person
his
clothes
and
the
horse
he
rode
and
a
promise
of
fifty
guineas
reward
to
any
person
who
would
give
an
account
of
him
so
that
he
might
be
captured
to
captain
count
galgenstein
at
birmingham
to
murfey
at
the
golden
ball
in
the
savoy
or
bates
at
the
blew
anchor
in
but
captain
wood
in
an
enormous
periwig
that
cost
him
sixty
pounds
with
high
red
heels
to
his
shoes
a
silver
sword
and
a
gold
and
a
large
wound
obtained
he
said
at
the
siege
of
barcelona
which
disfigured
much
of
his
countenance
and
caused
him
to
cover
one
eye
was
in
small
danger
he
thought
of
being
mistaken
for
corporal
brock
the
deserter
of
cutts
and
strutted
along
the
mall
with
as
grave
an
air
as
the
very
best
nobleman
who
appeared
there
he
was
generally
indeed
voted
to
be
very
good
company
and
as
his
expenses
were
unlimited
a
few
convent
candlesticks
my
dear
he
used
to
whisper
melt
into
a
vast
number
of
doubloons
he
commanded
as
good
society
as
he
chose
to
ask
for
and
it
was
speedily
known
as
a
fact
throughout
town
that
captain
wood
who
had
served
under
his
majesty
charles
iii
of
spain
had
carried
off
the
diamond
petticoat
of
our
lady
of
compostella
and
lived
upon
the
proceeds
of
the
fraud
people
were
good
protestants
in
those
days
and
many
a
one
longed
to
have
been
his
partner
in
the
pious
plunder
in
the
ingenious
contemporary
history
of
moll
flanders
a
periwig
is
mentioned
as
costing
that
sum
all
surmises
concerning
his
wealth
captain
wood
with
much
discretion
encouraged
he
contradicted
no
report
but
was
quite
ready
to
confirm
all
and
when
two
different
rumours
were
positively
put
to
him
he
used
only
to
laugh
and
say
my
dear
sir
do
make
the
stories
but
i
not
called
upon
to
deny
them
and
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
shall
assent
to
every
one
of
them
so
you
may
believe
them
or
not
as
you
and
so
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
gentleman
not
only
wealthy
but
discreet
in
truth
it
was
almost
a
pity
that
worthy
brock
had
not
been
a
gentleman
born
in
which
case
doubtless
he
would
have
lived
and
died
as
became
his
station
for
he
spent
his
money
like
a
gentleman
he
loved
women
like
a
gentleman
he
would
fight
like
a
gentleman
he
gambled
and
got
drunk
like
a
gentleman
what
did
he
want
else
only
a
matter
of
six
descents
a
little
money
and
an
estate
to
render
him
the
equal
of
john
or
harley
ah
those
were
merry
days
would
brock
say
for
he
loved
in
a
good
old
age
to
recount
the
story
of
his
london
fashionable
campaign
and
when
i
think
how
near
i
was
to
become
a
great
man
and
to
die
perhaps
a
general
i
ca
but
marvel
at
the
wicked
obstinacy
of
my
i
will
tell
you
what
i
did
my
dear
i
had
lodgings
in
piccadilly
as
if
i
were
a
lord
i
had
two
large
periwigs
and
three
suits
of
laced
clothes
i
kept
a
little
black
dressed
out
like
a
turk
i
walked
daily
in
the
mall
i
dined
at
the
politest
ordinary
in
covent
garden
i
frequented
the
best
of
and
knew
all
the
pretty
fellows
of
the
town
i
cracked
a
bottle
with
addison
and
lent
many
a
piece
to
dick
steele
a
sad
debauched
rogue
my
dear
and
above
all
i
tell
you
what
i
did
the
noblest
stroke
that
sure
ever
a
gentleman
performed
in
my
situation
one
day
going
into
i
saw
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
gathered
together
and
heard
one
of
them
say
wood
i
do
know
the
man
but
there
was
a
captain
wood
in
southwell
regiment
egad
it
was
my
lord
peterborough
himself
who
was
talking
about
me
so
putting
off
my
hat
i
made
a
most
gracious
conge
to
my
lord
and
said
i
knew
him
and
rode
behind
him
at
barcelona
on
our
entry
into
that
town
doubt
you
did
captain
wood
says
my
lord
taking
my
hand
no
doubt
you
know
me
for
many
more
know
tom
fool
than
tom
fool
knows
and
with
this
at
which
all
of
us
laughed
my
lord
called
for
a
bottle
and
he
and
i
sat
down
and
drank
it
together
well
he
was
in
disgrace
as
you
know
but
he
grew
mighty
fond
of
me
and
would
you
believe
it
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
presenting
me
at
court
yes
to
her
sacred
majesty
the
queen
and
my
lady
marlborough
who
was
in
high
feather
ay
truly
the
sentinels
on
duty
used
to
salute
me
as
if
i
were
corporal
john
himself
i
was
on
the
high
road
to
fortune
charley
mordaunt
used
to
call
me
jack
and
drink
canary
at
my
chambers
i
used
to
make
one
at
my
lord
treasurer
levee
i
had
even
got
walpole
to
take
a
hundred
guineas
as
a
compliment
and
he
had
promised
me
a
majority
when
bad
luck
turned
and
all
my
fine
hopes
were
overthrown
in
a
twinkling
you
see
my
dear
that
after
we
had
left
that
gaby
galgenstein
ha
ha
with
a
gag
in
his
mouth
and
in
his
pocket
the
honest
count
was
in
the
sorriest
plight
in
the
world
owing
money
here
and
there
to
tradesmen
a
cool
thousand
to
the
warwickshire
squire
and
all
this
on
eighty
pounds
a
year
well
for
a
little
time
the
tradesmen
held
their
hands
while
the
jolly
count
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
catch
hold
of
his
dear
corporal
and
his
dear
over
again
and
placarded
every
town
from
london
to
liverpool
with
descriptions
of
my
pretty
person
the
bird
was
flown
however
the
money
clean
gone
and
when
there
was
no
hope
of
regaining
it
what
did
the
creditors
do
but
clap
my
gay
gentleman
into
shrewsbury
gaol
where
i
wish
he
had
rotted
for
my
part
but
no
such
luck
for
honest
peter
brock
or
captain
wood
as
he
was
in
those
days
one
blessed
monday
i
went
to
wait
on
secretary
and
he
squeezed
my
hand
and
whispered
to
me
that
i
was
to
be
major
of
a
regiment
in
virginia
the
very
thing
for
you
see
my
dear
i
care
about
joining
my
lord
duke
in
flanders
being
pretty
well
known
to
the
army
there
the
secretary
squeezed
my
hand
it
had
a
bill
in
it
and
wished
me
joy
and
called
me
major
and
bowed
me
out
of
his
closet
into
the
and
as
gay
as
may
be
i
went
off
to
the
in
whitehall
which
is
much
frequented
by
gentlemen
of
our
profession
where
i
bragged
not
a
little
of
my
good
luck
amongst
the
company
were
several
of
my
acquaintance
and
amongst
them
a
gentleman
i
did
not
much
care
to
see
look
you
i
saw
a
uniform
that
i
knew
red
and
yellow
facings
cutts
my
dear
and
the
wearer
of
this
was
no
other
than
his
excellency
gustavus
adolphus
maximilian
whom
we
all
know
of
he
stared
me
full
in
the
face
right
into
my
eye
one
was
patched
you
know
and
after
standing
with
his
mouth
open
gave
a
step
back
and
then
a
step
forward
and
then
screeched
out
brock
beg
your
pardon
sir
says
i
you
speak
to
me
swear
it
brock
cries
gal
as
soon
as
he
hears
my
voice
and
laid
hold
of
my
cuff
a
pretty
bit
of
mechlin
as
ever
you
saw
by
the
way
says
i
drawing
it
back
and
giving
my
lord
a
little
touch
of
the
fist
just
at
the
last
button
of
the
waistcoat
my
dear
a
rare
place
if
you
wish
to
prevent
a
man
from
speaking
too
much
it
sent
him
reeling
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
says
i
says
i
puppy
and
coxcomb
what
do
you
mean
by
laying
your
hand
on
me
major
you
giv
him
his
billyful
roared
out
a
long
irish
unattached
ensign
that
i
had
treated
with
many
a
glass
of
nantz
at
the
tavern
and
so
indeed
i
had
for
the
wretch
could
not
speak
for
some
minutes
and
all
the
officers
stood
laughing
at
him
as
he
writhed
and
wriggled
hideously
this
is
a
monstrous
scandal
says
one
officer
of
rank
and
honour
at
fists
like
a
parcel
of
carters
of
honour
says
the
count
who
had
fetched
up
his
breath
by
this
time
i
made
for
the
door
but
macshane
held
me
and
said
you
are
not
going
to
shirk
him
sure
whereupon
i
gripped
his
hand
and
vowed
i
would
have
the
dog
life
of
honour
says
the
count
tell
you
the
man
is
a
deserter
a
thief
and
a
swindler
he
was
my
corporal
and
ran
away
with
a
thou
you
lie
i
roared
out
and
made
another
cut
at
him
with
my
cane
but
the
gentlemen
rushed
between
us
bluthanowns
says
honest
macshane
lying
scounthrel
this
fellow
is
gentlemen
i
swear
be
me
honour
that
captain
wood
was
wounded
at
barcelona
and
that
i
saw
him
there
and
that
he
and
i
ran
away
together
at
the
battle
of
almanza
and
bad
luck
to
us
you
see
my
dear
that
these
irish
have
the
strongest
imaginations
in
the
world
and
that
i
had
actually
persuaded
poor
mac
that
he
and
i
were
friends
in
spain
everybody
knew
mac
who
was
a
character
in
his
way
and
believed
him
a
gentleman
says
i
have
your
blood
i
will
instant
says
the
count
who
was
boiling
with
fury
where
you
like
house
says
i
says
he
and
off
we
went
in
good
time
too
for
the
constables
came
in
at
the
thought
of
such
a
disturbance
and
wanted
to
take
us
in
charge
but
the
gentlemen
present
being
military
men
would
not
hear
of
this
out
came
mac
rapier
and
that
of
others
and
the
constables
were
then
told
to
do
their
duty
if
they
liked
or
to
take
a
and
leave
us
to
ourselves
off
they
went
and
presently
in
a
couple
of
coaches
the
count
and
his
friends
i
and
mine
drove
off
to
the
fields
behind
montague
house
oh
that
vile
why
did
i
enter
it
we
came
to
the
ground
honest
macshane
was
my
second
and
much
disappointed
because
the
second
on
the
other
side
would
not
make
a
fight
of
it
and
exchange
a
few
passes
with
him
but
he
was
an
old
major
a
cool
old
hand
as
brave
as
steel
and
no
fool
well
the
swords
are
measured
galgenstein
strips
off
his
doublet
and
i
my
handsome
in
like
fashion
galgenstein
flings
off
his
hat
and
i
handed
mine
over
the
lace
on
it
cost
me
twenty
pounds
i
longed
to
be
at
him
for
curse
him
i
hate
him
and
know
that
he
has
no
chance
with
me
at
not
fight
in
that
periwig
sure
says
macshane
course
not
says
i
and
took
it
off
may
all
barbers
be
roasted
in
flames
may
all
periwigs
bobwigs
scratchwigs
and
ramillies
cocks
frizzle
in
purgatory
from
this
day
forth
to
the
end
of
time
mine
was
the
ruin
of
me
what
might
i
not
have
been
now
but
for
that
wig
i
gave
it
over
to
ensign
macshane
and
with
it
went
what
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
large
patch
which
i
wore
over
one
eye
which
popped
out
fierce
staring
and
lively
as
was
ever
any
eye
in
the
world
on
says
i
and
made
a
lunge
at
my
count
but
he
sprang
back
the
dog
was
as
active
as
a
hare
and
knew
from
old
times
that
i
was
his
master
with
the
and
his
second
wondering
struck
up
my
blade
will
not
fight
that
man
says
he
looking
mighty
pale
swear
upon
my
honour
that
his
name
is
peter
brock
he
was
for
two
years
my
corporal
and
deserted
running
away
with
a
thousand
pounds
of
my
moneys
look
at
the
fellow
what
is
the
matter
with
his
eye
why
did
he
wear
a
patch
over
it
but
stop
says
he
have
more
proof
hand
me
my
and
from
it
sure
enough
he
produced
the
infernal
proclamation
announcing
my
desertion
if
the
fellow
has
a
scar
across
his
left
ear
and
i
ca
say
my
dear
but
what
i
have
it
was
done
by
a
cursed
dutchman
at
the
boyne
me
if
he
has
not
got
in
blue
upon
his
right
arm
and
there
it
is
sure
enough
swaggering
irishman
may
be
his
accomplice
for
what
i
know
but
i
will
have
no
dealings
with
brock
save
with
a
constable
for
a
second
is
an
odd
story
captain
wood
said
the
old
major
who
acted
for
the
count
scounthrelly
falsehood
regarding
me
and
my
friend
shouted
out
macshane
the
count
shall
answer
for
it
stop
says
the
major
wood
is
too
gallant
a
gentleman
i
am
sure
not
to
satisfy
the
count
and
will
show
us
that
he
has
no
such
mark
on
his
arm
as
only
private
soldiers
put
there
wood
says
i
do
no
such
thing
major
i
fight
that
scoundrel
galgenstein
or
you
or
any
of
you
like
a
man
of
honour
but
i
wo
submit
to
be
searched
like
a
thief
in
coorse
said
macshane
must
take
my
man
off
the
ground
says
the
major
take
him
sir
says
i
in
a
rage
just
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
him
that
he
a
coward
and
a
liar
and
that
my
lodgings
are
in
piccadilly
where
if
ever
he
finds
courage
to
meet
me
he
may
hear
of
me
i
shpit
on
ye
all
cries
my
gallant
ally
macshane
and
sure
enough
he
kept
his
word
or
all
but
suiting
the
action
to
it
at
any
rate
and
so
we
gathered
up
our
clothes
and
went
back
in
our
separate
coaches
and
no
blood
spilt
is
it
thrue
now
said
macshane
when
we
were
alone
it
thrue
now
all
these
divvles
have
been
saying
says
i
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
am
and
insign
these
years
you
like
a
few
pieces
says
i
and
i
should
for
to
tell
you
the
secred
thrut
i
not
tasted
mate
these
four
days
then
ensign
it
is
true
says
i
as
for
meat
you
shall
have
some
at
the
first
i
bade
the
coach
stop
until
he
bought
a
plateful
which
he
ate
in
the
carriage
for
my
time
was
precious
i
just
told
him
the
whole
story
at
which
he
laughed
and
swore
that
it
was
the
best
piece
of
generalship
he
ever
heard
on
when
his
belly
was
full
i
took
out
a
couple
of
guineas
and
gave
them
to
him
macshane
began
to
cry
at
this
and
kissed
me
and
swore
he
never
would
desert
me
as
indeed
my
dear
i
do
think
he
will
for
we
have
been
the
best
of
friends
ever
since
and
he
the
only
man
i
ever
could
trust
i
think
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
my
head
but
i
had
a
scent
of
some
mischief
in
the
wind
so
stopped
the
coach
a
little
before
i
got
home
and
turning
into
a
tavern
begged
macshane
to
go
before
me
to
my
lodging
and
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
which
he
did
and
came
back
to
me
as
pale
as
death
saying
that
the
house
was
full
of
constables
the
cursed
quarrel
at
the
had
i
suppose
set
the
beaks
upon
me
and
a
pretty
sweep
they
made
of
it
ah
my
dear
five
hundred
pounds
in
money
five
suits
of
laced
clothes
three
periwigs
besides
laced
shirts
swords
canes
and
and
all
to
go
back
to
that
scoundrel
count
it
was
all
over
with
me
i
saw
no
more
being
a
gentleman
for
me
and
if
i
remained
to
be
caught
only
a
choice
between
tyburn
and
a
file
of
grenadiers
my
love
under
such
circumstances
a
gentleman
ca
be
particular
and
must
be
prompt
the
was
hard
by
where
i
used
to
hire
my
coach
to
go
to
court
ha
ha
and
was
known
as
a
man
of
substance
thither
i
went
immediately
warmmash
says
i
gallant
friend
here
and
i
have
a
mind
for
a
ride
and
a
supper
at
twickenham
so
you
must
lend
us
a
pair
of
your
best
horses
which
he
did
in
a
twinkling
and
off
we
rode
we
did
not
go
into
the
park
but
turned
off
and
cantered
smartly
up
towards
kilburn
and
when
we
got
into
the
country
galloped
as
if
the
devil
were
at
our
heels
bless
you
my
love
it
was
all
done
in
a
minute
and
the
ensign
and
i
found
ourselves
regular
knights
of
the
road
before
we
knew
where
we
were
almost
only
think
of
our
finding
you
and
your
new
husband
at
the
rooks
there
not
a
greater
fence
than
the
landlady
in
all
the
country
it
was
she
that
put
us
on
seizing
your
husband
and
introduced
us
to
the
other
two
gentlemen
whose
names
i
do
know
any
more
than
the
and
what
became
of
the
horses
said
catherine
to
brock
when
his
tale
was
finished
rips
madam
said
he
mere
rips
we
sold
them
at
stourbridge
fair
and
got
but
thirteen
guineas
for
the
and
and
the
count
max
where
is
he
brock
sighed
she
whew
whistled
brock
what
hankering
after
him
still
my
dear
he
is
off
to
flanders
with
his
regiment
and
i
make
no
doubt
there
have
been
twenty
countesses
of
galgenstein
since
your
i
do
believe
any
such
thing
sir
said
catherine
starting
up
very
angrily
if
you
did
i
suppose
you
laudanum
him
would
you
leave
the
room
fellow
said
the
lady
but
she
recollected
herself
speedily
again
and
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
very
wretched
at
brock
at
the
ceiling
at
the
floor
at
her
husband
from
whom
she
violently
turned
away
her
head
she
began
to
cry
piteously
to
which
tears
the
corporal
set
up
a
gentle
accompaniment
of
whistling
as
they
trickled
one
after
another
down
her
nose
i
do
think
they
were
tears
of
repentance
but
of
regret
for
the
time
when
she
had
her
first
love
and
her
fine
clothes
and
her
white
hat
and
blue
feather
of
the
two
the
corporal
whistle
was
much
more
innocent
than
the
girl
sobbing
he
was
a
rogue
but
a
old
fellow
when
his
humour
was
not
crossed
surely
our
make
a
great
mistake
in
divesting
their
rascals
of
all
gentle
human
qualities
they
have
such
and
the
only
sad
point
to
think
of
is
in
all
private
concerns
of
life
abstract
feelings
and
dealings
with
friends
and
so
on
how
dreadfully
like
a
rascal
is
to
an
honest
man
the
man
who
murdered
the
italian
boy
set
him
first
to
play
with
his
children
whom
he
loved
and
who
doubtless
deplored
his
loss
chapter
vi
adventures
of
the
ambassador
macshane
if
we
had
not
been
obliged
to
follow
history
in
all
respects
it
is
probable
that
we
should
have
left
out
the
last
adventure
of
catherine
and
her
husband
at
the
inn
at
worcester
altogether
for
in
truth
very
little
came
of
it
and
it
is
not
very
romantic
or
striking
but
we
are
bound
to
stick
closely
above
all
by
the
truth
the
truth
though
it
be
not
particularly
pleasant
to
read
of
or
to
tell
as
anybody
may
read
in
the
newgate
calendar
and
hayes
were
taken
at
an
inn
at
worcester
were
confined
there
were
swindled
by
persons
who
pretended
to
impress
the
bridegroom
for
military
service
what
is
one
to
do
after
that
had
we
been
writing
novels
instead
of
authentic
histories
we
might
have
carried
them
anywhere
else
we
chose
and
we
had
a
great
mind
to
make
hayes
philosophising
with
bolingbroke
like
a
certain
devereux
and
catherine
maitresse
en
titre
to
alexander
pope
doctor
sacheverel
sir
john
reade
the
oculist
dean
swift
or
marshal
tallard
as
the
very
commonest
romancer
would
under
such
circumstances
but
alas
and
alas
truth
must
be
spoken
whatever
else
is
in
the
wind
and
the
excellent
newgate
calendar
which
contains
the
biographies
and
thanatographies
of
hayes
and
his
wife
does
not
say
a
word
of
their
connections
with
any
of
the
leading
literary
or
military
heroes
of
the
time
of
her
majesty
queen
anne
the
calendar
says
in
so
many
words
that
hayes
was
obliged
to
send
to
his
father
in
warwickshire
for
money
to
get
him
out
of
the
scrape
and
that
the
old
gentleman
came
down
to
his
aid
by
this
truth
must
we
stick
and
not
for
the
sake
of
the
most
brilliant
episode
no
not
for
a
bribe
of
twenty
extra
guineas
per
sheet
would
we
depart
from
it
brock
account
of
his
adventure
in
london
has
given
the
reader
some
short
notice
of
his
friend
mr
macshane
neither
the
wits
nor
the
principles
of
that
worthy
ensign
were
particularly
firm
for
drink
poverty
and
a
crack
on
the
skull
at
the
battle
of
steenkirk
had
served
to
injure
the
former
and
the
ensign
was
not
in
his
best
days
possessed
of
any
share
of
the
latter
he
had
really
at
one
period
held
such
a
rank
in
the
army
but
pawned
his
for
drink
and
play
and
for
many
years
past
had
lived
one
of
the
hundred
thousand
miracles
of
our
city
upon
nothing
that
anybody
knew
of
or
of
which
he
himself
could
give
any
account
who
has
not
a
catalogue
of
these
men
in
his
list
who
can
tell
whence
comes
the
occasional
clean
shirt
who
supplies
the
continual
means
of
drunkenness
who
wards
off
the
starvation
their
life
is
a
wonder
from
day
to
day
their
breakfast
a
wonder
their
dinner
a
miracle
their
bed
an
interposition
of
providence
if
you
and
i
my
dear
sir
want
a
shilling
tomorrow
who
will
give
it
us
will
our
butchers
give
us
will
our
laundresses
clothe
us
in
clean
linen
not
a
bone
or
a
rag
standing
as
we
do
may
it
be
ever
so
somewhat
removed
from
want
is
there
one
of
us
who
does
not
shudder
at
the
thought
of
descending
into
the
lists
to
combat
with
it
and
expect
anything
but
to
be
utterly
crushed
in
the
encounter
the
author
it
must
be
remembered
has
his
lodgings
and
food
provided
for
him
by
the
government
of
his
country
not
a
bit
of
it
my
dear
sir
it
takes
much
more
than
you
think
for
to
starve
a
man
starvation
is
very
little
when
you
are
used
to
it
some
people
i
know
even
who
live
on
it
quite
comfortably
and
make
their
daily
bread
by
it
it
had
been
our
friend
macshane
sole
profession
for
many
years
and
he
did
not
fail
to
draw
from
it
such
a
livelihood
as
was
sufficient
and
perhaps
too
good
for
him
he
managed
to
dine
upon
it
a
certain
or
rather
uncertain
number
of
days
in
the
week
to
sleep
somewhere
and
to
get
drunk
at
least
three
hundred
times
a
year
he
was
known
to
one
or
two
noblemen
who
occasionally
helped
him
with
a
few
pieces
and
whom
he
helped
in
turn
never
mind
how
he
had
other
acquaintances
whom
he
pestered
undauntedly
and
from
whom
he
occasionally
extracted
a
dinner
or
a
crown
or
mayhap
by
mistake
a
goldheaded
cane
which
found
its
way
to
the
pawnbroker
when
flush
of
cash
he
would
appear
at
the
when
low
in
funds
the
deuce
knows
into
what
mystic
caves
and
dens
he
slunk
for
food
and
lodging
he
was
perfectly
ready
with
his
sword
and
when
sober
or
better
still
a
very
little
tipsy
was
a
complete
master
of
it
in
the
art
of
boasting
and
lying
he
had
hardly
any
equals
in
shoes
he
stood
six
feet
five
inches
and
here
is
his
complete
signalement
it
was
a
fact
that
he
had
been
in
spain
as
a
volunteer
where
he
had
shown
some
gallantry
had
had
a
and
was
sent
home
to
starve
as
before
macshane
had
however
like
conrad
the
corsair
one
virtue
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
crimes
he
was
faithful
to
his
employer
for
the
time
being
and
a
story
is
told
of
him
which
may
or
may
not
be
to
his
credit
viz
that
being
hired
on
one
occasion
by
a
certain
lord
to
inflict
a
punishment
upon
a
roturier
who
had
crossed
his
lordship
in
his
amours
he
macshane
did
actually
refuse
from
the
person
to
be
belaboured
and
who
entreated
his
forbearance
a
larger
sum
of
money
than
the
nobleman
gave
him
for
the
beating
which
he
performed
punctually
as
bound
in
honour
and
friendship
this
tale
would
the
ensign
himself
relate
with
much
and
when
after
the
sudden
flight
from
london
he
and
brock
took
to
their
roving
occupation
he
cheerfully
submitted
to
the
latter
as
his
commanding
officer
called
him
always
major
and
bating
blunders
and
drunkenness
was
perfectly
true
to
his
leader
he
had
a
notion
and
indeed
i
do
know
that
it
was
a
wrong
one
that
his
profession
was
now
as
before
strictly
military
and
according
to
the
rules
of
honour
robbing
he
called
plundering
the
enemy
and
hanging
was
in
his
idea
a
dastardly
and
cruel
advantage
that
the
latter
took
and
that
called
for
the
sternest
reprisals
the
other
gentlemen
concerned
were
strangers
to
brock
who
felt
little
inclined
to
trust
either
of
them
upon
such
a
message
or
with
such
a
large
sum
to
bring
back
they
had
strange
to
say
a
similar
mistrust
on
their
side
but
brock
lugged
out
five
guineas
which
he
placed
in
the
landlady
hand
as
security
for
his
comrade
return
and
ensign
macshane
being
mounted
on
poor
hayes
own
horse
set
off
to
visit
the
parents
of
that
unhappy
young
man
it
was
a
gallant
sight
to
behold
our
thieves
ambassador
in
a
faded
suit
with
orange
facings
in
a
pair
of
huge
unconscious
of
blacking
with
a
mighty
sword
by
his
side
and
a
little
shabby
beaver
cocked
over
a
large
ride
out
from
the
inn
of
the
three
rooks
on
his
mission
to
hayes
paternal
village
it
was
eighteen
miles
distant
from
worcester
but
macshane
performed
the
distance
in
safety
and
in
sobriety
moreover
for
such
had
been
his
instructions
and
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
house
of
old
hayes
towards
which
indeed
john
horse
trotted
incontinently
hayes
who
was
knitting
at
the
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
grey
gelding
and
of
the
stranger
mounted
upon
it
flinging
himself
off
the
steed
with
much
agility
macshane
as
soon
as
his
feet
reached
the
ground
brought
them
rapidly
together
in
order
to
make
a
profound
and
elegant
bow
to
hayes
and
slapping
his
greasy
beaver
against
his
heart
and
poking
his
periwig
almost
into
the
nose
of
the
old
lady
demanded
whether
he
had
the
shooprame
honour
of
adthressing
misthriss
hees
having
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
then
proceeded
to
ask
whether
there
was
a
blackguard
boy
in
the
house
who
would
take
the
horse
to
the
steeble
whether
he
could
have
a
dthrink
of
or
buthermilk
being
faith
uncommon
dthry
and
whether
finally
he
could
be
feevored
with
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
with
her
and
hees
on
a
matther
of
consitherable
all
these
preliminaries
were
to
be
complied
with
before
macshane
would
enter
at
all
into
the
subject
of
his
visit
the
horse
and
man
were
cared
for
hayes
was
called
in
and
not
a
little
anxious
did
hayes
grow
in
the
meanwhile
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
her
darling
son
where
is
he
how
is
he
is
he
dead
said
the
old
lady
oh
yes
i
sure
dead
indeed
madam
and
you
misteeken
intirely
the
young
man
is
perfectly
well
in
oh
praised
be
heaven
but
mighty
cast
down
in
sperrits
to
misfortunes
madam
look
you
the
best
of
us
are
subject
and
a
trifling
one
has
fell
upon
your
and
herewith
macshane
produced
a
letter
in
the
handwriting
of
young
hayes
of
which
we
have
had
the
good
luck
to
procure
a
copy
it
ran
thus
honored
father
and
mother
the
bearer
of
this
is
a
kind
gentleman
who
has
left
me
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble
yesterday
at
this
towne
i
fell
in
with
some
gentlemen
of
the
queene
servas
after
drinking
with
whom
i
accepted
her
majesty
mony
to
enliste
repenting
thereof
i
did
endeavour
to
escape
and
in
so
doing
had
the
misfortune
to
strike
my
superior
officer
whereby
i
made
myself
liable
to
death
according
to
the
rules
of
warr
if
however
i
pay
twenty
ginnys
all
will
be
wel
you
must
give
the
same
to
the
barer
els
i
shall
be
shott
without
fail
on
tewsday
morning
and
so
no
more
from
your
loving
son
john
hayes
from
my
prison
at
bristol
this
unhappy
when
hayes
read
this
pathetic
missive
its
success
with
her
was
complete
and
she
was
for
going
immediately
to
the
cupboard
and
producing
the
money
necessary
for
her
darling
son
release
but
the
carpenter
hayes
was
much
more
suspicious
i
do
know
you
sir
said
he
to
the
ambassador
do
you
doubt
my
honour
sir
said
the
ensign
very
fiercely
why
sir
replied
hayes
i
know
little
about
it
one
way
or
other
but
shall
take
it
for
granted
if
you
will
explain
a
little
more
of
this
i
sildom
condescind
to
explean
said
macshane
for
it
not
the
custom
in
my
rank
but
i
explean
anything
in
pray
will
you
tell
me
in
what
regiment
my
son
is
enlisted
in
coorse
in
colonel
wood
fut
my
dear
and
a
gallant
corps
it
is
as
any
in
the
and
you
left
him
on
me
soul
only
three
hours
ago
having
rid
like
a
ever
since
as
in
the
sacred
cause
of
humanity
curse
me
every
man
as
hayes
house
was
seventy
miles
from
bristol
the
old
gentleman
thought
this
was
marvellous
quick
riding
and
so
cut
the
conversation
short
you
have
said
quite
enough
sir
said
he
to
show
me
there
is
some
roguery
in
the
matter
and
that
the
whole
story
is
false
from
beginning
to
at
this
abrupt
charge
the
ensign
looked
somewhat
puzzled
and
then
spoke
with
much
gravity
roguery
said
he
misthur
hees
is
a
sthrong
term
and
which
in
consideration
of
my
friendship
for
your
family
i
shall
pass
over
you
doubt
your
son
honour
as
there
wrote
by
him
in
black
and
white
you
have
forced
him
to
write
said
hayes
the
sly
old
divvle
right
muttered
macshane
aside
well
sir
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
has
been
forced
to
write
it
the
story
about
the
enlistment
is
a
pretty
fib
if
you
will
from
beginning
to
end
and
what
then
my
dear
do
you
think
your
son
any
better
off
for
that
oh
where
is
he
screamed
hayes
plumping
down
on
her
knees
we
will
give
him
the
money
wo
we
john
i
know
you
will
madam
when
i
tell
you
where
he
is
he
is
in
the
hands
of
some
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
who
are
at
war
with
the
present
government
and
no
more
care
about
cutting
a
man
throat
than
they
do
a
chicken
he
is
a
prisoner
madam
of
our
sword
and
spear
if
you
choose
to
ransom
him
well
and
good
if
not
peace
be
with
him
for
never
more
shall
you
see
and
how
do
i
know
you
wo
come
back
for
more
money
asked
hayes
sir
you
have
my
honour
and
i
as
lieve
break
my
neck
as
my
word
said
macshane
gravely
twenty
guineas
is
the
bargain
take
ten
minutes
to
talk
of
it
take
it
then
or
leave
it
it
all
the
same
to
me
my
and
it
must
be
said
of
our
friend
the
ensign
that
he
meant
every
word
he
said
and
that
he
considered
the
embassy
on
which
he
had
come
as
perfectly
honourable
and
regular
and
pray
what
prevents
us
said
hayes
starting
up
in
a
rage
from
taking
hold
of
you
as
a
surety
for
him
you
would
fire
on
a
flag
of
truce
would
ye
you
dishonourable
ould
civilian
replied
macshane
besides
says
he
there
more
reasons
to
prevent
you
the
first
is
this
pointing
to
his
sword
here
are
two
more
and
these
were
pistols
and
the
last
and
the
best
of
all
is
that
you
might
hang
me
and
dthraw
me
and
quarther
me
an
yet
never
see
so
much
as
the
tip
of
your
son
nose
again
look
you
sir
we
run
mighty
risks
in
our
profession
it
not
all
play
i
can
tell
you
we
obliged
to
be
punctual
too
or
it
all
up
with
the
thrade
if
i
promise
that
your
son
will
die
as
sure
as
fate
morning
unless
i
return
home
safe
our
people
must
keep
my
promise
or
else
what
chance
is
there
for
me
you
would
be
down
upon
me
in
a
moment
with
a
posse
of
constables
and
have
me
swinging
before
warwick
gaol
pooh
my
dear
you
never
would
sacrifice
a
darling
boy
like
john
hayes
let
alone
his
lady
for
the
sake
of
my
long
carcass
one
or
two
of
our
gentlemen
have
been
taken
that
way
already
because
parents
and
guardians
would
not
believe
and
what
became
of
the
poor
children
said
hayes
who
began
to
perceive
the
gist
of
the
argument
and
to
grow
dreadfully
frightened
do
let
talk
of
them
humanity
shudthers
at
the
thought
and
herewith
macshane
drew
his
finger
across
his
throat
in
such
a
dreadful
way
as
to
make
the
two
parents
tremble
it
the
way
of
war
madam
look
you
the
service
i
have
the
honour
to
belong
to
is
not
paid
by
the
queen
and
so
we
obliged
to
make
our
prisoners
pay
according
to
established
military
no
lawyer
could
have
argued
his
case
better
than
macshane
so
far
and
he
completely
succeeded
in
convincing
and
hayes
of
the
necessity
of
ransoming
their
son
promising
that
the
young
man
should
be
restored
to
them
next
morning
along
with
his
beautiful
lady
he
courteously
took
leave
of
the
old
couple
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
worcester
again
the
elder
hayes
wondered
who
the
lady
could
be
of
whom
the
ambassador
had
spoken
for
their
son
elopement
was
altogether
unknown
to
them
but
anger
or
doubt
about
this
subject
was
overwhelmed
by
their
fears
for
their
darling
john
safety
away
rode
the
gallant
macshane
with
the
money
necessary
to
effect
this
and
it
must
be
mentioned
as
highly
to
his
credit
that
he
never
once
thought
of
appropriating
the
sum
to
himself
or
of
deserting
his
comrades
in
any
way
his
ride
from
worcester
had
been
a
long
one
he
had
left
that
city
at
noon
but
before
his
return
thither
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
landscape
which
had
been
dressed
like
a
prodigal
in
purple
and
gold
now
appeared
like
a
quaker
in
dusky
grey
and
the
trees
by
the
grew
black
as
undertakers
or
physicians
and
bending
their
solemn
heads
to
each
other
whispered
ominously
among
themselves
and
the
mists
hung
on
the
common
and
the
cottage
lights
went
out
one
by
one
and
the
earth
and
heaven
grew
black
but
for
some
twinkling
useless
stars
which
freckled
the
ebon
countenance
of
the
latter
and
the
air
grew
colder
and
about
two
the
moon
appeared
a
dismal
rake
walking
solitary
through
the
deserted
sky
and
about
four
mayhap
the
dawn
wretched
opened
in
the
east
the
shutters
of
the
day
in
other
words
more
than
a
dozen
hours
had
passed
corporal
brock
had
been
relieved
by
redcap
the
latter
by
sicklop
the
gentleman
john
hayes
in
spite
of
her
sorrows
and
bashfulness
had
followed
the
example
of
her
husband
and
fallen
asleep
by
his
side
slept
for
many
hours
and
awakened
still
under
the
guardianship
of
brock
troop
and
all
parties
began
anxiously
to
expect
the
return
of
the
ambassador
macshane
that
officer
who
had
performed
the
first
part
of
his
journey
with
such
distinguished
prudence
and
success
found
the
night
on
his
journey
homewards
was
growing
mighty
cold
and
dark
and
as
he
was
thirsty
and
hungry
had
money
in
his
purse
and
saw
no
cause
to
hurry
he
determined
to
take
refuge
at
an
alehouse
for
the
night
and
to
make
for
worcester
by
dawn
the
next
morning
he
accordingly
alighted
at
the
first
inn
on
his
road
consigned
his
horse
to
the
stable
and
entering
the
kitchen
called
for
the
best
liquor
in
the
house
a
small
company
was
assembled
at
the
inn
among
whom
macshane
took
his
place
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
and
having
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
his
pocket
felt
a
mighty
contempt
for
his
society
and
soon
let
them
know
the
contempt
he
felt
for
them
after
a
third
flagon
of
ale
he
discovered
that
the
liquor
was
sour
and
emptied
with
much
spluttering
and
grimaces
the
remainder
of
the
beer
into
the
fire
this
process
so
offended
the
parson
of
the
parish
who
in
those
good
old
times
did
not
disdain
to
take
the
post
of
honour
in
the
that
he
left
his
corner
looking
wrathfully
at
the
offender
who
without
any
more
ado
instantly
occupied
it
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
hear
the
jingling
of
the
twenty
pieces
in
his
pocket
the
oaths
which
he
distributed
between
the
landlord
the
guests
and
the
liquor
to
remark
the
sprawl
of
his
mighty
before
the
sweep
of
which
the
timid
guests
edged
farther
and
farther
away
and
the
languishing
leers
which
he
cast
on
the
landlady
as
with
arms
he
attempted
to
seize
upon
her
when
the
ostler
had
done
his
duties
in
the
stable
he
entered
the
inn
and
whispered
the
landlord
that
the
stranger
was
riding
john
horse
of
which
fact
the
host
soon
convinced
himself
and
did
not
fail
to
have
some
suspicions
of
his
guest
had
he
not
thought
that
times
were
unquiet
horses
might
be
sold
and
one
man
money
was
as
good
as
another
he
probably
would
have
arrested
the
ensign
immediately
and
so
lost
all
the
profit
of
the
score
which
the
latter
was
causing
every
moment
to
be
enlarged
in
a
couple
of
hours
with
that
happy
facility
which
one
may
have
often
remarked
in
men
of
the
gallant
ensign
nation
he
had
managed
to
disgust
every
one
of
the
landlord
other
guests
and
scare
them
from
the
kitchen
frightened
by
his
addresses
the
landlady
too
had
taken
flight
and
the
host
was
the
only
person
left
in
the
apartment
who
there
stayed
for
interest
sake
merely
and
listened
moodily
to
his
tipsy
guest
conversation
in
an
hour
more
the
whole
house
was
awakened
by
a
violent
noise
of
howling
curses
and
pots
clattering
to
and
fro
forth
issued
landlady
in
her
out
came
john
ostler
with
his
pitchfork
downstairs
tumbled
cook
and
one
or
two
guests
and
found
the
landlord
and
ensign
on
the
the
wig
of
the
latter
lying
much
singed
and
emitting
strange
odours
in
the
fireplace
his
face
hideously
distorted
and
a
great
quantity
of
his
natural
hair
in
the
partial
occupation
of
the
landlord
who
had
drawn
it
and
the
head
down
towards
him
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
benefit
of
pummelling
the
latter
more
at
his
ease
in
revenge
the
landlord
was
undermost
and
the
ensign
arms
were
working
up
and
down
his
face
and
body
like
the
flaps
of
a
the
man
of
war
had
clearly
the
best
of
it
the
combatants
were
separated
as
soon
as
possible
but
as
soon
as
the
excitement
of
the
fight
was
over
ensign
macshane
was
found
to
have
no
further
powers
of
speech
sense
or
locomotion
and
was
carried
by
his
late
antagonist
to
bed
his
sword
and
pistols
which
had
been
placed
at
his
side
at
the
commencement
of
the
evening
were
carefully
put
by
and
his
pocket
visited
twenty
guineas
in
gold
a
large
knife
used
probably
for
the
cutting
of
some
crumbs
of
those
delicacies
and
a
paper
of
tobacco
found
in
the
and
in
the
bosom
of
the
coat
the
leg
of
a
cold
fowl
and
half
of
a
raw
onion
constituted
his
whole
property
these
articles
were
not
very
suspicious
but
the
beating
which
the
landlord
had
received
tended
greatly
to
confirm
his
own
and
his
doubts
about
their
guest
and
it
was
determined
to
send
off
in
the
early
morning
to
hayes
informing
him
how
a
person
had
lain
at
their
inn
who
had
ridden
thither
mounted
upon
young
hayes
horse
off
set
john
ostler
at
earliest
dawn
but
on
his
way
he
woke
up
justice
clerk
and
communicated
his
suspicions
to
him
and
mr
clerk
consulted
with
the
village
baker
who
was
always
up
early
and
the
clerk
the
baker
the
butcher
with
his
cleaver
and
two
gentlemen
who
were
going
to
work
all
adjourned
to
the
inn
accordingly
when
ensign
macshane
was
in
a
plunged
in
that
deep
slumber
which
only
innocence
and
drunkenness
enjoy
in
this
world
and
charming
the
ears
of
morn
by
the
regular
and
melodious
music
of
his
nose
a
vile
plot
was
laid
against
him
and
when
about
seven
of
the
clock
he
woke
he
found
on
sitting
up
in
his
bed
three
gentlemen
on
each
side
of
it
armed
and
looking
ominous
one
held
a
staff
and
albeit
unprovided
with
a
warrant
would
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
seizing
macshane
and
of
carrying
him
before
his
worship
at
the
hall
taranouns
man
said
the
ensign
springing
up
in
bed
and
abruptly
breaking
off
a
loud
sonorous
yawn
with
which
he
had
opened
the
business
of
the
day
you
wo
deteen
a
gentleman
who
on
life
and
death
i
give
ye
my
word
an
affair
of
how
came
you
by
that
there
horse
said
the
baker
how
came
you
by
these
here
fifteen
guineas
said
the
landlord
in
whose
hands
by
some
process
five
of
the
gold
pieces
had
disappeared
what
is
this
here
idolatrous
string
of
beads
said
the
clerk
macshane
the
fact
is
was
a
catholic
but
did
not
care
to
own
it
for
in
those
days
his
religion
was
not
popular
baids
holy
mother
of
saints
give
me
back
them
baids
said
macshane
clasping
his
hands
they
were
blest
i
tell
you
by
his
holiness
the
po
psha
i
mane
they
belong
to
a
darling
little
daughter
i
had
that
in
heaven
now
and
as
for
the
money
and
the
horse
i
should
like
to
know
how
a
gentleman
is
to
travel
in
this
counthry
without
why
you
see
he
may
travel
in
the
country
to
git
here
shrewdly
remarked
the
constable
and
it
our
belief
that
neither
horse
nor
money
is
honestly
come
by
if
his
worship
is
satisfied
why
so
in
course
shall
we
be
but
there
is
highwaymen
abroad
look
you
and
to
our
notion
you
have
very
much
the
cut
of
further
remonstrances
or
threats
on
the
part
of
macshane
were
useless
although
he
vowed
that
he
was
first
cousin
to
the
duke
of
leinster
an
officer
in
her
majesty
service
and
the
dearest
friend
lord
marlborough
had
his
impudent
captors
would
not
believe
a
word
of
his
statement
which
further
was
garnished
with
a
tremendous
number
of
oaths
and
he
was
about
eight
carried
up
to
the
house
of
squire
ballance
the
neighbouring
justice
of
the
peace
when
the
worthy
magistrate
asked
the
crime
of
which
the
prisoner
had
been
guilty
the
captors
looked
somewhat
puzzled
for
the
moment
since
in
truth
it
could
not
be
shown
that
the
ensign
had
committed
any
crime
at
all
and
if
he
had
confined
himself
to
simple
silence
and
thrown
upon
them
the
onus
of
proving
his
misdemeanours
justice
ballance
must
have
let
him
loose
and
soundly
rated
his
clerk
and
the
landlord
for
detaining
an
honest
gentleman
on
so
frivolous
a
charge
but
this
caution
was
not
in
the
ensign
disposition
and
though
his
accusers
produced
no
satisfactory
charge
against
him
his
own
words
were
quite
enough
to
show
how
suspicious
his
character
was
when
asked
his
name
he
gave
it
in
as
captain
geraldine
on
his
way
to
ireland
by
bristol
on
a
visit
to
his
cousin
the
duke
of
leinster
he
swore
solemnly
that
his
friends
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
lord
peterborough
under
both
of
whom
he
had
served
should
hear
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
and
when
the
justice
a
sly
old
gentleman
and
one
that
read
the
gazettes
asked
him
at
what
battles
he
had
been
present
the
gallant
ensign
pitched
on
a
couple
in
spain
and
in
flanders
which
had
been
fought
within
a
week
of
each
other
and
vowed
that
he
had
been
desperately
wounded
at
both
so
that
at
the
end
of
his
examination
which
had
been
taken
down
by
the
clerk
he
had
been
made
to
acknowledge
as
follows
captain
geraldine
six
feet
four
inches
in
height
thin
with
a
very
long
red
nose
and
red
hair
grey
eyes
and
speaks
with
a
strong
irish
accent
is
the
of
the
duke
of
leinster
and
in
constant
communication
with
him
does
not
know
whether
his
grace
has
any
children
does
not
know
whereabouts
he
lives
in
london
can
not
say
what
sort
of
a
looking
man
his
grace
is
is
acquainted
with
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
served
in
the
dragoons
at
the
battle
of
ramillies
at
which
time
he
was
with
my
lord
peterborough
before
barcelona
borrowed
the
horse

weeks

that
it
was

his
master
stable
four
days
ago
and
is
the
property
of
john

not
account
for
the
fifteen
guineas
found
on
him
by
the
landlord
says
there
were
twenty
says
he
won
them
at
cards
a
fortnight
since
at
edinburgh
says
he
is
riding
about
the
country
for
his
amusement
afterwards
says
he
is
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
going
to

declared
last
night
in
the

and
has
large
estates
in
ireland
and
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
the
bank
of
england
has
no
shirt
or
stockings
and
the
coat
he
wears
is
marked
in
his
boots
is
written
thomas
rodgers
and
in
his
hat
is
the
name
of
the
rev
doctor
doctor
snoffler
lived
at
worcester
and
had
lately
advertised
in
the
hue
and
cry
a
number
of
articles
taken
from
his
house
macshane
said
in
reply
to
this
that
his
hat
had
been
changed
at
the
inn
and
he
was
ready
to
take
his
oath
that
he
came
thither
in
a
one
but
this
fact
was
disproved
by
the
oaths
of
many
persons
who
had
seen
him
at
the
inn
and
he
was
about
to
be
imprisoned
for
the
thefts
which
he
had
not
committed
the
fact
about
the
hat
being
that
he
had
purchased
it
from
a
gentleman
at
the
three
rooks
for
two
pints
of
beer
he
was
about
to
be
remanded
when
behold
hayes
the
elder
made
her
appearance
and
to
her
it
was
that
the
ensign
was
indebted
for
his
freedom
old
hayes
had
gone
to
work
before
the
ostler
arrived
but
when
his
wife
heard
the
lad
message
she
instantly
caused
her
pillion
to
be
placed
behind
the
saddle
and
mounting
the
grey
horse
urged
the
to
gallop
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
to
the
justice
house
she
entered
panting
and
alarmed
oh
what
is
your
honour
going
to
do
to
this
honest
gentleman
said
she
in
the
name
of
heaven
let
him
go
his
time
is
precious
he
has
important
business
business
of
life
and
i
tould
the
jidge
so
said
the
ensign
but
he
refused
to
take
my
word
the
sacred
wurrd
of
honour
of
captain
macshane
was
good
at
a
single
lie
though
easily
flustered
on
an
examination
and
this
was
a
very
creditable
stratagem
to
acquaint
hayes
with
the
name
that
he
bore
what
you
know
captain
geraldine
said
ballance
who
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
carpenter
wife
in
coorse
she
does
has
she
known
me
these
tin
years
are
we
not
related
did
she
give
me
the
very
horse
which
i
rode
and
to
make
belave
tould
you
i
bought
in
london
let
her
tell
her
own
story
are
you
related
to
captain
geraldine
hayes
yes
oh
yes
a
very
elegant
connection
and
you
gave
him
the
horse
did
you
of
your
own
oh
yes
of
my
own
will
i
would
give
him
anything
do
do
your
honour
let
him
go
his
child
is
dying
said
the
old
lady
bursting
into
tears
it
may
be
dead
before
he
gets
to
before
he
gets
there
oh
your
honour
your
honour
pray
pray
do
detain
him
the
justice
did
not
seem
to
understand
this
excessive
sympathy
on
the
part
of
hayes
nor
did
the
father
himself
appear
to
be
nearly
so
affected
by
his
child
probable
fate
as
the
honest
woman
who
interested
herself
for
him
on
the
contrary
when
she
made
this
passionate
speech
captain
geraldine
only
grinned
and
said
niver
mind
my
dear
if
his
honour
will
keep
an
honest
gentleman
for
doing
nothing
why
let
him
the
law
must
settle
between
us
and
as
for
the
child
poor
thing
the
lord
deliver
it
at
this
hayes
fell
to
entreating
more
loudly
than
ever
and
as
there
was
really
no
charge
against
him
ballance
was
constrained
to
let
him
go
the
landlord
and
his
friends
were
making
off
rather
confused
when
ensign
macshane
called
upon
the
former
in
a
thundering
voice
to
stop
and
refund
the
five
guineas
which
he
had
stolen
from
him
again
the
host
swore
there
were
but
fifteen
in
his
pocket
but
when
on
the
bible
the
ensign
solemnly
vowed
that
he
had
twenty
and
called
upon
hayes
to
say
whether
yesterday
before
he
entered
the
inn
she
had
not
seen
him
with
twenty
guineas
and
that
lady
expressed
herself
ready
to
swear
that
she
had
landlord
looked
more
crestfallen
than
ever
and
said
that
he
had
not
counted
the
money
when
he
took
it
and
though
he
did
in
his
soul
believe
that
there
were
only
fifteen
guineas
rather
than
be
suspected
of
a
shabby
action
he
would
pay
the
five
guineas
out
of
his
own
pocket
which
he
did
and
with
the
ensign
or
rather
hayes
own
coin
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
justice
house
macshane
in
the
fulness
of
his
gratitude
could
not
help
bestowing
an
embrace
upon
hayes
and
when
she
implored
him
to
let
her
ride
behind
him
to
her
darling
son
he
yielded
with
a
very
good
grace
and
off
the
pair
set
on
john
hayes
grey
who
has
nosey
brought
with
him
now
said
sicklop
brock
confederate
who
about
three
hours
after
the
above
adventure
was
lolling
in
the
yard
of
the
three
it
was
our
ensign
with
the
mother
of
his
captive
they
had
not
met
with
any
accident
in
their
ride
i
shall
now
have
the
shooprame
bliss
said
macshane
with
much
feeling
as
he
lifted
hayes
from
the
saddle
the
shooprame
bliss
of
intwining
two
harrts
that
are
mead
for
one
another
ours
my
dear
is
a
dismal
profession
but
ah
do
moments
like
this
make
aminds
for
years
of
pain
this
way
my
dear
turn
to
your
right
then
to
your
left
mind
the
stip
and
the
third
door
round
the
all
these
precautions
were
attended
to
and
after
giving
his
concerted
knock
macshane
was
admitted
into
an
apartment
which
he
entered
holding
his
gold
pieces
in
the
one
hand
and
a
lady
by
the
other
we
shall
not
describe
the
meeting
which
took
place
between
mother
and
son
the
old
lady
wept
copiously
the
young
man
was
really
glad
to
see
his
relative
for
he
deemed
that
his
troubles
were
over
cat
bit
her
lips
and
stood
aside
looking
somewhat
foolish
brock
counted
the
money
and
macshane
took
a
large
dose
of
strong
waters
as
a
pleasing
solace
for
his
labours
dangers
and
fatigue
when
the
maternal
feelings
were
somewhat
calmed
the
old
lady
had
leisure
to
look
about
her
and
really
felt
a
kind
of
friendship
and
goodwill
for
the
company
of
thieves
in
which
she
found
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
conferred
an
actual
favour
on
her
in
robbing
her
of
twenty
guineas
threatening
her
son
life
and
finally
letting
him
go
who
is
that
droll
old
gentleman
said
she
and
being
told
that
it
was
captain
wood
she
dropped
him
a
curtsey
and
said
with
much
respect
captain
your
very
humble
servant
which
compliment
brock
acknowledged
by
a
gracious
smile
and
bow
and
who
is
this
pretty
young
lady
continued
hayes
why
hum
oh
mother
you
must
give
her
your
blessing
she
is
john
and
herewith
hayes
brought
forward
his
interesting
lady
to
introduce
her
to
his
mamma
the
news
did
not
at
all
please
the
old
lady
who
received
catherine
embrace
with
a
very
sour
face
indeed
however
the
mischief
was
done
and
she
was
too
glad
to
get
back
her
son
to
be
on
such
an
occasion
very
angry
with
him
so
after
a
proper
rebuke
she
told
john
hayes
that
though
she
never
approved
of
her
son
attachment
and
thought
he
married
below
his
condition
yet
as
the
evil
was
done
it
was
their
duty
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
she
for
her
part
would
receive
her
into
her
house
and
make
her
as
comfortable
there
as
she
could
i
wonder
whether
she
has
any
more
money
in
that
house
whispered
sicklop
to
redcap
who
with
the
landlady
had
come
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
had
been
amusing
themselves
by
the
contemplation
of
this
sentimental
scene
what
a
fool
that
wild
hirishman
was
not
to
bleed
her
for
more
said
the
landlady
but
he
a
poor
ignorant
papist
i
sure
my
man
this
gentleman
had
been
hanged
would
have
come
away
with
such
a
beggarly
suppose
we
have
some
more
out
of
said
redcap
what
prevents
us
we
have
got
the
old
mare
and
the
colt
too
ha
ha
and
the
pair
of
ought
to
be
worth
at
least
a
hundred
to
this
conversation
was
carried
on
sotto
voce
and
i
do
know
whether
brock
had
any
notion
of
the
plot
which
was
arranged
by
the
three
worthies
the
landlady
began
it
which
punch
madam
will
you
take
says
she
you
must
have
something
for
the
good
of
the
house
now
you
are
in
in
coorse
said
the
ensign
certainly
said
the
other
three
but
the
old
lady
said
she
was
anxious
to
leave
the
place
and
putting
down
a
requested
the
hostess
to
treat
the
gentlemen
in
her
absence
captain
said
the
old
lady
ajew
cried
the
ensign
and
long
life
to
you
my
dear
you
got
me
out
of
a
scrape
at
the
justice
yonder
and
split
me
but
insign
macshane
will
remimber
it
as
long
as
he
and
now
hayes
and
the
two
ladies
made
for
the
door
but
the
landlady
placed
herself
against
it
and
sicklop
said
no
no
my
pretty
madams
you
ai
off
so
cheap
as
that
neither
you
are
not
going
out
for
a
beggarly
twenty
guineas
look
you
we
must
have
hayes
starting
back
and
cursing
his
fate
fairly
burst
into
tears
the
two
women
screamed
and
brock
looked
as
if
the
proposition
both
amused
and
had
been
expected
by
him
but
not
so
ensign
macshane
major
said
he
clawing
fiercely
hold
of
brock
arms
ensign
said
brock
smiling
arr
we
or
arr
we
not
men
of
honour
oh
in
coorse
said
brock
laughing
and
using
macshane
favourite
expression
if
we
arr
men
of
honour
we
are
bound
to
stick
to
our
word
and
hark
ye
you
dirty
scoundrel
if
you
do
immadiately
make
way
for
these
leedies
and
this
young
jontleman
who
crying
so
the
meejor
here
and
i
will
lug
out
and
force
and
so
saying
he
drew
his
great
sword
and
made
a
pass
at
sicklop
which
that
gentleman
avoided
and
which
caused
him
and
his
companion
to
retreat
from
the
door
the
landlady
still
kept
her
position
at
it
and
with
a
storm
of
oaths
against
the
ensign
and
against
two
englishmen
who
ran
away
from
a
wild
hirishman
swore
she
would
not
budge
a
foot
and
would
stand
there
until
her
dying
day
faith
then
needs
must
said
the
ensign
and
made
a
lunge
at
the
hostess
which
passed
so
near
the
wretch
throat
that
she
screamed
sank
on
her
knees
and
at
last
opened
the
door
down
the
stairs
then
with
great
state
macshane
led
the
elder
lady
the
married
couple
following
and
having
seen
them
to
the
street
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
party
whom
he
vowed
that
he
would
come
and
see
you
can
walk
the
eighteen
miles
aisy
between
this
and
nightfall
said
he
walk
exclaimed
hayes
why
have
we
got
ball
and
shall
ride
and
tie
all
the
way
madam
cried
macshane
in
a
stern
voice
honour
before
everything
did
you
not
in
the
presence
of
his
worship
vow
and
declare
that
you
gave
me
that
horse
and
now
d
talk
of
taking
it
back
again
let
me
tell
you
madam
that
such
paltry
thricks
ill
become
a
person
of
your
years
and
respectability
and
ought
never
to
be
played
with
insign
timothy
he
waved
his
hat
and
strutted
down
the
street
and
catherine
hayes
along
with
her
bridegroom
and
made
the
best
of
their
way
homeward
on
foot
chapter
vii
which
embraces
a
period
of
seven
years
the
recovery
of
so
considerable
a
portion
of
his
property
from
the
clutches
of
brock
was
as
may
be
imagined
no
trifling
source
of
joy
to
that
excellent
young
man
count
gustavus
adolphus
de
galgenstein
and
he
was
often
known
to
say
with
much
archness
and
a
proper
feeling
of
gratitude
to
the
fate
which
had
ordained
things
so
that
the
robbery
was
in
reality
one
of
the
best
things
that
could
have
happened
to
him
for
in
event
of
brock
not
stealing
the
money
his
excellency
the
count
would
have
had
to
pay
the
whole
to
the
warwickshire
squire
who
had
won
it
from
him
at
play
he
was
enabled
in
the
present
instance
to
plead
his
notorious
poverty
as
an
excuse
and
the
warwickshire
conqueror
got
off
with
nothing
except
a
very
badly
written
autograph
of
the
count
simply
acknowledging
the
debt
this
point
his
excellency
conceded
with
the
greatest
candour
but
as
doubtless
the
reader
may
have
remarked
in
the
course
of
his
experience
to
owe
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
to
pay
and
from
the
day
of
his
winning
the
money
until
the
day
of
his
death
the
warwickshire
squire
did
never
by
any
chance
touch
a
single
bob
tizzy
tester
moidore
maravedi
doubloon
tomaun
or
rupee
of
the
sum
which
monsieur
de
galgenstein
had
lost
to
him
that
young
nobleman
was
as
brock
hinted
in
the
little
autobiographical
sketch
which
we
gave
in
a
former
chapter
incarcerated
for
a
certain
period
and
for
certain
other
debts
in
the
donjons
of
shrewsbury
but
he
released
himself
from
them
by
that
noble
and
consolatory
method
of
whitewashing
which
the
law
has
provided
for
gentlemen
in
his
oppressed
condition
and
he
had
not
been
a
week
in
london
when
he
fell
in
with
and
overcame
or
put
to
flight
captain
wood
alias
brock
and
immediately
seized
upon
the
remainder
of
his
property
after
receiving
this
the
count
with
commendable
discretion
disappeared
from
england
altogether
for
a
while
nor
are
we
at
all
authorised
to
state
that
any
of
his
debts
to
his
tradesmen
were
discharged
any
more
than
his
debts
of
honour
as
they
are
pleasantly
called
having
thus
settled
with
his
creditors
the
gallant
count
had
interest
enough
with
some
of
the
great
folk
to
procure
for
himself
a
post
abroad
and
was
absent
in
holland
for
some
time
it
was
here
that
he
became
acquainted
with
the
lovely
madam
silverkoop
the
widow
of
a
deceased
gentleman
of
leyden
and
although
the
lady
was
not
at
that
age
at
which
tender
passions
are
usually
inspired
being
sixty
and
though
she
could
not
like
mademoiselle
ninon
de
then
at
paris
boast
of
charms
which
defied
the
progress
of
time
for
silverkoop
was
as
red
as
a
boiled
lobster
and
as
unwieldy
as
a
porpoise
and
although
her
mental
attractions
did
by
no
means
make
up
for
her
personal
deficiencies
for
she
was
jealous
violent
vulgar
drunken
and
stingy
to
a
miracle
yet
her
charms
had
an
immediate
effect
on
monsieur
de
galgenstein
and
hence
perhaps
the
reader
the
rogue
how
well
he
knows
the
world
will
be
led
to
conclude
that
the
honest
widow
was
rich
such
indeed
she
was
and
count
gustavus
despising
the
difference
between
his
twenty
quarterings
and
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
laid
the
most
desperate
siege
to
her
and
finished
by
causing
her
to
capitulate
as
i
do
believe
after
a
reasonable
degree
of
pressing
any
woman
will
do
to
any
man
such
at
least
has
been
my
experience
in
the
matter
the
count
then
married
and
it
was
curious
to
see
how
he
who
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
cat
had
been
as
great
a
tiger
and
domestic
bully
as
any
extant
now
by
degrees
fell
into
a
quiet
submission
towards
his
enormous
countess
who
ordered
him
up
and
down
as
a
lady
orders
her
footman
who
permitted
him
speedily
not
to
have
a
will
of
his
own
and
who
did
not
allow
him
a
shilling
of
her
money
without
receiving
for
the
same
an
accurate
account
how
was
it
that
he
the
abject
slave
of
madam
silverkoop
had
been
victorious
over
cat
the
first
blow
is
i
believe
the
decisive
one
in
these
cases
and
the
countess
had
stricken
it
a
week
after
their
marriage
establishing
a
supremacy
which
the
count
never
afterwards
attempted
to
question
we
have
alluded
to
his
excellency
marriage
as
in
duty
bound
because
it
will
be
necessary
to
account
for
his
appearance
hereafter
in
a
more
splendid
fashion
than
that
under
which
he
has
hitherto
been
known
to
us
and
just
comforting
the
reader
by
the
knowledge
that
the
union
though
prosperous
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
was
in
reality
extremely
unhappy
we
must
say
no
more
from
this
time
forth
of
the
fat
and
legitimate
madam
de
galgenstein
our
darling
is
catherine
who
had
formerly
acted
in
her
stead
and
only
in
so
much
as
the
fat
countess
did
influence
in
any
way
the
destinies
of
our
heroine
or
those
wise
and
virtuous
persons
who
have
appeared
and
are
to
follow
her
to
her
end
shall
we
in
any
degree
allow
her
name
to
figure
here
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
get
a
glimpse
as
one
sometimes
does
when
the
time
is
past
of
some
little
little
wheel
which
works
the
whole
mighty
machinery
of
fate
and
see
how
our
destinies
turn
on
a
minute
delay
or
advance
or
on
the
turning
of
a
street
or
on
somebody
else
turning
of
a
street
or
on
somebody
else
doing
of
something
else
in
downing
street
or
in
timbuctoo
now
or
a
thousand
years
ago
thus
for
instance
if
miss
poots
in
the
year
had
never
been
the
lovely
inmate
of
a
spielhaus
at
amsterdam
van
silverkoop
would
never
have
seen
her
if
the
day
had
not
been
extraordinarily
hot
the
worthy
merchant
would
never
have
gone
thither
if
he
had
not
been
fond
of
rhenish
wine
and
sugar
he
never
would
have
called
for
any
such
delicacies
if
he
had
not
called
for
them
miss
ottilia
poots
would
never
have
brought
them
and
partaken
of
them
if
he
had
not
been
rich
she
would
certainly
have
rejected
all
the
advances
made
to
her
by
silverkoop
if
he
had
not
been
so
fond
of
rhenish
and
sugar
he
never
would
have
died
and
silverkoop
would
have
been
neither
rich
nor
a
widow
nor
a
wife
to
count
von
galgenstein
nay
nor
would
this
history
have
ever
been
written
for
if
count
galgenstein
had
not
married
the
rich
widow
catherine
would
never
have
oh
my
dear
madam
you
thought
we
were
going
to
tell
you
pooh
nonsense
no
such
thing
not
for
two
or
three
and
seventy
pages
or
so
when
perhaps
you
may
know
what
catherine
never
would
have
done
the
reader
will
remember
in
the
second
chapter
of
these
memoirs
the
announcement
that
catherine
had
given
to
the
world
a
child
who
might
bear
if
he
chose
the
arms
of
galgenstein
with
the
further
adornment
of
a
this
child
had
been
put
out
to
nurse
some
time
before
its
mother
elopement
from
the
count
and
as
that
nobleman
was
in
funds
at
the
time
having
had
that
success
at
play
which
we
duly
chronicled
he
paid
a
sum
of
no
less
than
twenty
guineas
which
was
to
be
the
yearly
reward
of
the
nurse
into
whose
charge
the
boy
was
put
the
woman
grew
fond
of
the
brat
and
when
after
the
first
year
she
had
no
further
news
or
remittances
from
father
or
mother
she
determined
for
a
while
at
least
to
maintain
the
infant
at
her
own
expense
for
when
rebuked
by
her
neighbours
on
this
score
she
stoutly
swore
that
no
parents
could
ever
desert
their
children
and
that
some
day
or
other
she
should
not
fail
to
be
rewarded
for
her
trouble
with
this
one
under
this
strange
mental
hallucination
poor
goody
billings
who
had
five
children
and
a
husband
of
her
own
continued
to
give
food
and
shelter
to
little
tom
for
a
period
of
no
less
than
seven
years
and
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
young
gentleman
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
merit
the
kindnesses
shown
to
him
goody
billings
who
was
of
a
very
soft
and
pitiful
disposition
continued
to
bestow
them
upon
him
because
she
said
he
was
lonely
and
unprotected
and
deserved
them
more
than
other
children
who
had
fathers
and
mothers
to
look
after
them
if
then
any
difference
was
made
between
tom
treatment
and
that
of
her
own
brood
it
was
considerably
in
favour
of
the
former
to
whom
the
largest
proportions
of
treacle
were
allotted
for
his
bread
and
the
handsomest
supplies
of
hasty
pudding
besides
to
do
billings
justice
there
was
a
party
against
him
and
that
consisted
not
only
of
her
husband
and
her
five
children
but
of
every
single
person
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
becoming
acquainted
with
master
tom
a
celebrated
philosopher
i
think
miss
edgeworth
has
broached
the
consolatory
doctrine
that
in
intellect
and
disposition
all
human
beings
are
entirely
equal
and
that
circumstance
and
education
are
the
causes
of
the
distinctions
and
divisions
which
afterwards
unhappily
take
place
among
them
not
to
argue
this
question
which
places
jack
howard
and
jack
thurtell
on
an
exact
level
which
would
have
us
to
believe
that
lord
melbourne
is
by
natural
gifts
and
excellences
a
man
as
honest
brave
and
as
the
duke
of
wellington
which
would
make
out
that
lord
lyndhurst
is
in
point
of
principle
eloquence
and
political
honesty
no
better
than
not
i
say
arguing
this
doctrine
let
us
simply
state
that
master
thomas
billings
for
having
no
other
he
took
the
name
of
the
worthy
people
who
adopted
him
was
in
his
fearfully
passionate
screaming
and
roaring
perpetually
and
showing
all
the
ill
that
he
could
show
at
the
age
of
two
when
his
strength
enabled
him
to
toddle
abroad
his
favourite
resort
was
the
or
the
his
roarings
had
not
diminished
in
the
least
and
he
had
added
to
his
former
virtues
two
new
ones
a
love
of
fighting
and
stealing
both
which
amiable
qualities
he
had
many
opportunities
of
exercising
every
day
he
fought
his
little
adoptive
brothers
and
sisters
he
kicked
and
cuffed
his
father
and
mother
he
fought
the
cat
stamped
upon
the
kittens
was
worsted
in
a
severe
battle
with
the
hen
in
the
backyard
but
in
revenge
nearly
beat
a
little
to
death
whom
he
caught
alone
and
rambling
near
his
favourite
haunt
the
as
for
stealing
he
stole
the
eggs
which
he
perforated
and
emptied
the
butter
which
he
ate
with
or
without
bread
as
he
could
find
it
the
sugar
which
he
cunningly
secreted
in
the
leaves
of
a
baker
chronicle
that
nobody
in
the
establishment
could
read
and
thus
from
the
pages
of
history
he
used
to
suck
in
all
he
knew
thieving
and
lying
namely
in
which
for
his
years
he
made
wonderful
progress
if
any
followers
of
miss
edgeworth
and
the
philosophers
are
inclined
to
disbelieve
this
statement
or
to
set
it
down
as
overcharged
and
distorted
let
them
be
assured
that
just
this
very
picture
was
of
all
the
pictures
in
the
world
taken
from
nature
i
ikey
solomons
once
had
a
dear
little
brother
who
could
steal
before
he
could
walk
and
this
not
from
encouragement
for
if
you
know
the
world
you
must
know
that
in
families
of
our
profession
the
point
of
honour
is
sacred
at
home
but
from
pure
nature
who
could
steal
i
say
before
he
could
walk
and
lie
before
he
could
speak
and
who
at
four
and
a
half
years
of
age
having
attacked
my
sister
rebecca
on
some
question
of
lollipops
had
smitten
her
on
the
elbow
with
a
apologising
to
us
by
saying
simply
her
i
wish
it
had
been
her
head
dear
dear
aminadab
i
think
of
you
and
laugh
these
philosophers
to
scorn
nature
made
you
for
that
career
which
you
fulfilled
you
were
from
your
birth
to
your
dying
a
scoundrel
you
could
have
been
anything
else
however
your
lot
was
cast
and
blessed
it
was
that
you
were
born
among
the
prigs
for
had
you
been
of
any
other
profession
alas
alas
what
ills
might
you
have
done
as
i
have
heard
the
author
of
richelieu
siamese
twins
etc
say
poeta
nascitur
non
fit
which
means
that
though
he
had
tried
ever
so
much
to
be
a
poet
it
was
all
moonshine
in
the
like
manner
i
say
roagus
nascitur
non
we
have
it
from
nature
and
so
a
fig
for
miss
edgeworth
in
this
manner
then
while
his
father
blessed
with
a
wealthy
wife
was
leading
in
a
fine
house
the
life
of
a
while
his
mother
married
to
hayes
and
made
an
honest
women
of
as
the
saying
is
was
passing
her
time
respectably
in
warwickshire
thomas
billings
was
inhabiting
the
same
county
not
cared
for
by
either
of
them
but
ordained
by
fate
to
join
them
one
day
and
have
a
mighty
influence
upon
the
fortunes
of
both
for
as
it
has
often
happened
to
the
traveller
in
the
york
or
the
exeter
coach
to
fall
snugly
asleep
in
his
corner
and
on
awaking
suddenly
to
find
himself
sixty
or
seventy
miles
from
the
place
where
somnus
first
visited
him
as
we
say
although
you
sit
still
time
poor
wretch
keeps
perpetually
running
on
and
so
must
run
day
and
night
with
never
a
pause
or
a
halt
of
five
minutes
to
get
a
drink
until
his
dying
day
let
the
reader
imagine
that
since
he
left
hayes
and
all
the
other
worthy
personages
of
this
history
in
the
last
chapter
seven
years
have
sped
away
during
which
all
our
heroes
and
heroines
have
been
accomplishing
their
destinies
seven
years
of
country
carpentering
or
rather
trading
on
the
part
of
a
husband
of
ceaseless
scolding
violence
and
discontent
on
the
part
of
a
wife
are
not
pleasant
to
describe
so
we
shall
omit
altogether
any
account
of
the
early
married
life
of
and
john
hayes
the
newgate
calendar
to
which
excellent
compilation
we
and
the
other
popular
novelists
of
the
day
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
states
that
hayes
left
his
house
three
or
four
times
during
this
period
and
urged
by
the
restless
humours
of
his
wife
tried
several
professions
returning
however
as
he
grew
weary
of
each
to
his
wife
and
his
paternal
home
after
a
certain
time
his
parents
died
and
by
their
demise
he
succeeded
to
a
small
property
and
the
carpentering
business
which
he
for
some
time
followed
what
then
in
the
meanwhile
had
become
of
captain
wood
or
brock
and
ensign
macshane
the
only
persons
now
to
be
accounted
for
in
our
catalogue
for
about
six
months
after
their
capture
and
release
of
hayes
those
noble
gentlemen
had
followed
with
much
prudence
and
success
that
trade
which
the
celebrated
and
polite
duval
the
ingenious
sheppard
the
dauntless
turpin
and
indeed
many
other
heroes
of
our
most
popular
novels
had
pursued
or
were
pursuing
in
their
time
and
so
considerable
were
said
to
be
captain
wood
gains
that
reports
were
abroad
of
his
having
somewhere
a
buried
treasure
to
which
he
might
have
added
more
had
not
fate
suddenly
cut
short
his
career
as
a
prig
he
and
the
ensign
were
shame
to
say
transported
for
stealing
three
off
a
railing
at
exeter
and
not
being
known
in
the
town
which
they
had
only
reached
that
morning
they
were
detained
by
no
further
charges
but
simply
condemned
on
this
one
for
this
misdemeanour
her
majesty
government
vindictively
sent
them
for
seven
years
beyond
the
sea
and
as
the
fashion
then
was
sold
the
use
of
their
bodies
to
virginian
planters
during
that
space
of
time
it
is
thus
alas
that
the
strong
are
always
used
to
deal
with
the
weak
and
many
an
honest
fellow
has
been
led
to
rue
his
unfortunate
difference
with
the
law
thus
then
we
have
settled
all
scores
the
count
is
in
holland
with
his
wife
cat
in
warwickshire
along
with
her
excellent
husband
master
thomas
billings
with
his
adoptive
parents
in
the
same
county
and
the
two
military
gentlemen
watching
the
progress
and
cultivation
of
the
tobacco
and
cotton
plant
in
the
new
world
all
these
things
having
passed
between
the
acts
the
drop
draws
up
and
the
next
act
begins
by
the
way
the
play
ends
with
a
drop
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
here
as
in
a
theatre
the
orchestra
is
supposed
to
play
something
melodious
the
people
get
up
shake
themselves
yawn
and
settle
down
in
their
seats
again
porter
ale
cider
comes
round
squeezing
through
the
legs
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
pit
nobody
takes
anything
as
usual
and
lo
the
curtain
rises
again
sh
hats
off
says
everybody
hayes
had
now
been
for
six
years
the
adored
wife
of
hayes
and
no
offspring
had
arisen
to
bless
their
loves
and
perpetuate
their
name
she
had
obtained
a
complete
mastery
over
her
lord
and
master
and
having
had
as
far
as
was
in
that
gentleman
power
every
single
wish
gratified
that
she
could
demand
in
the
way
of
dress
treats
to
coventry
and
birmingham
drink
and
what
not
for
though
a
hard
man
john
hayes
had
learned
to
spend
his
money
pretty
freely
on
himself
and
her
having
had
all
her
wishes
gratified
it
was
natural
that
she
should
begin
to
find
out
some
more
and
the
next
whim
she
hit
upon
was
to
be
restored
to
her
child
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
that
she
had
never
informed
her
husband
of
the
existence
of
that
phenomenon
although
he
was
aware
of
his
wife
former
connection
with
the
count
hayes
in
their
matrimonial
quarrels
invariably
taunting
him
with
accounts
of
her
former
splendour
and
happiness
and
with
his
own
meanness
of
taste
in
condescending
to
take
up
with
his
excellency
leavings
she
determined
then
but
as
yet
had
not
confided
her
determination
to
her
husband
she
would
have
her
boy
although
in
her
seven
residence
within
twenty
miles
of
him
she
had
never
once
thought
of
seeing
him
and
the
kind
reader
knows
that
when
his
excellent
lady
determines
on
a
thing
a
shawl
or
an
or
a
new
carriage
or
from
tamburini
or
a
night
at
the
eagle
tavern
city
road
or
a
ride
in
a
to
richmond
and
tea
and
at
rose
cottage
hotel
the
reader
high
or
low
knows
that
when
mrs
reader
desires
a
thing
have
it
she
will
you
may
just
as
well
talk
of
avoiding
her
as
of
avoiding
gout
bills
or
grey
hairs
and
that
you
know
is
impossible
i
for
my
part
have
had
all
three
ay
and
a
wife
too
i
say
that
when
a
woman
is
resolved
on
a
thing
happen
it
will
if
husbands
refuse
fate
will
interfere
flectere
si
nequeo
etc
but
quotations
are
odious
and
some
hidden
power
was
working
in
the
case
of
hayes
and
for
its
own
awful
purposes
lending
her
its
aid
who
has
not
felt
how
he
works
the
dreadful
conquering
spirit
of
ill
who
can
not
see
in
the
circle
of
his
own
society
the
fated
and
foredoomed
to
woe
and
evil
some
call
the
doctrine
of
destiny
a
dark
creed
but
for
me
i
would
fain
try
and
think
it
a
consolatory
one
it
is
better
with
all
one
sins
upon
one
head
to
deem
oneself
in
the
hands
of
fate
than
to
think
with
our
fierce
passions
and
weak
repentances
with
our
resolves
so
loud
so
vain
so
ludicrously
despicably
weak
and
frail
with
our
dim
wavering
wretched
conceits
about
virtue
and
our
irresistible
propensity
to

but
revenons
a
nos
moutons
let
us
return
to
that
sweet
lamb
master
thomas
and
the
ewe
cat
seven
years
had
passed
away
and
she
began
to
think
that
she
should
very
much
like
to
see
her
child
once
more
it
was
written
that
she
should
and
you
shall
hear
how
soon
after
without
any
great
exertions
of
hers
back
he
came
to
her
in
the
month
of
july
in
the
year
there
came
down
a
road
about
ten
miles
from
the
city
of
worcester
two
gentlemen
not
mounted
upon
one
horse
but
having
a
horse
between
them
a
sorry
bay
with
a
sorry
saddle
and
a
large
pack
behind
it
on
which
each
by
turn
took
a
ride
of
the
two
one
was
a
man
of
excessive
stature
with
red
hair
a
very
prominent
nose
and
a
faded
military
dress
while
the
other
an
old
personage
wore
the
costume
of
a
civilian
both
man
and
dress
appearing
to
have
reached
the
autumnal
or
seedy
state
however
the
pair
seemed
in
spite
of
their
apparent
poverty
to
be
passably
merry
the
old
gentleman
rode
the
horse
and
had
in
the
course
of
their
journey
ridden
him
two
miles
at
least
in
every
three
the
tall
one
walked
with
immense
strides
by
his
side
and
seemed
indeed
as
if
he
could
have
quickly
outstripped
the
animal
had
he
chosen
to
exert
his
speed
or
had
not
affection
for
his
comrade
retained
him
at
his
stirrup
a
short
time
previously
the
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
and
this
the
tall
man
on
foot
had
gathered
up
and
was
holding
in
his
hand
it
having
been
voted
that
the
first
blacksmith
to
whose
shop
they
should
come
should
be
called
upon
to
fit
it
again
upon
the
bay
horse
do
you
remimber
this
counthry
meejor
said
the
tall
man
who
was
looking
about
him
very
much
pleased
and
sucking
a
flower
i
think
thim
green
cornfields
is
prettier
looking
at
than
the
d
tobacky
out
yondther
and
bad
lack
to
it
i
recollect
the
place
right
well
and
some
queer
pranks
we
played
here
seven
years
agone
responded
the
gentleman
addressed
as
major
you
remember
that
man
and
his
wife
whom
we
took
in
pawn
at
the
rooks
and
the
landlady
only
hung
last
michaelmas
said
the
tall
man
parenthetically
hang
the
landlady
we
got
all
we
ever
would
out
of
her
you
know
but
about
the
man
and
woman
you
went
after
the
chap
mother
and
like
a
jackass
as
you
are
let
him
loose
well
the
woman
was
that
catherine
that
you
often
heard
me
talk
about
i
like
the
wench
her
for
i
almost
brought
her
up
and
she
was
for
a
year
or
two
along
with
that
scoundrel
galgenstein
who
has
been
the
cause
of
my
the
infernal
blackguard
and
ruffian
said
the
tall
man
who
with
his
companion
has
no
doubt
been
recognised
by
the
reader
well
this
catherine
had
a
child
by
galgenstein
and
somewhere
here
hard
by
the
woman
lived
to
whom
we
carried
the
brat
to
nurse
she
was
the
wife
of
a
blacksmith
one
billings
it
wo
be
out
of
the
way
to
get
our
horse
shod
at
his
house
if
he
is
alive
still
and
we
may
learn
something
about
the
little
beast
i
should
be
glad
to
see
the
mother
well
do
i
remimber
her
said
the
ensign
do
i
remimber
whisky
sure
i
do
and
the
snivelling
sneak
her
husband
and
the
stout
old
lady
her
and
the
dirty
ruffian
who
sold
me
the
hat
that
had
so
nearly
brought
me
into
trouble
oh
but
it
was
a
rare
rise
we
got
out
of
them
chaps
and
the
old
landlady
that
hanged
too
and
here
both
ensign
macshane
and
major
brock
or
wood
grinned
and
showed
much
satisfaction
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
the
reason
of
it
we
gave
the
british
public
to
understand
that
the
landlady
of
the
three
rooks
at
worcester
was
a
notorious
fence
or
banker
of
thieves
that
is
a
purchaser
of
their
merchandise
in
her
hands
brock
and
his
companion
had
left
property
to
the
amount
of
sixty
or
seventy
pounds
which
was
secreted
in
a
cunning
recess
in
a
chamber
of
the
three
rooks
known
only
to
the
landlady
and
the
gentlemen
who
banked
with
her
and
in
this
place
sicklop
the
man
who
had
joined
in
the
hayes
adventure
his
comrade
and
one
or
two
of
the
topping
prigs
of
the
county
were
free
sicklop
had
been
shot
dead
in
a
night
attack
near
bath
the
landlady
had
been
suddenly
hanged
as
an
accomplice
in
another
case
of
robbery
and
when
on
their
return
from
virginia
our
two
heroes
whose
hopes
of
livelihood
depended
upon
it
had
bent
their
steps
towards
worcester
they
were
not
a
little
frightened
to
hear
of
the
cruel
fate
of
the
hostess
and
many
of
the
amiable
frequenters
of
the
three
all
the
goodly
company
were
separated
the
house
was
no
longer
an
inn
was
the
money
gone
too
at
least
it
was
worth
while
to
look
which
brock
and
macshane
determined
to
do
the
house
being
now
a
private
one
brock
with
a
genius
that
was
above
his
station
visited
its
owner
with
a
huge
portfolio
under
his
arm
and
in
the
character
of
a
painter
requested
permission
to
take
a
particular
sketch
from
a
particular
window
the
ensign
followed
with
the
artist
materials
consisting
simply
of
a
screwdriver
and
a
crowbar
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
when
admission
was
granted
to
them
they
opened
the
door
and
to
their
inexpressible
satisfaction
discovered
not
their
own
peculiar
savings
exactly
for
these
had
been
appropriated
instantly
on
hearing
of
their
transportation
but
stores
of
money
and
goods
to
the
amount
of
near
three
hundred
pounds
to
which
macshane
said
they
had
as
just
and
honourable
a
right
as
anybody
else
and
so
they
had
as
just
a
right
as
anybody
except
the
original
owners
but
who
was
to
discover
them
with
this
booty
they
set
out
on
their
journey
anywhere
for
they
knew
not
whither
and
it
so
chanced
that
when
their
horse
shoe
came
off
they
were
within
a
few
furlongs
of
the
cottage
of
billings
the
blacksmith
as
they
came
near
they
were
saluted
by
tremendous
roars
issuing
from
the
smithy
a
small
boy
was
held
across
the
bellows
two
or
three
children
of
smaller
and
larger
growth
were
holding
him
down
and
many
others
of
the
village
were
gazing
in
at
the
window
while
a
man
was
lashing
the
little
boy
with
a
whip
and
occasioning
the
cries
heard
by
the
travellers
as
the
horse
drew
up
the
operator
looked
at
the
for
a
moment
and
then
proceeded
incontinently
with
his
work
belabouring
the
child
more
fiercely
than
ever
when
he
had
done
he
turned
round
to
the
and
asked
how
he
could
serve
them
whereupon
wood
for
such
was
the
name
he
adopted
and
by
such
we
shall
call
him
to
the
end
wittily
remarked
that
however
he
might
wish
to
serve
them
he
seemed
mightily
inclined
to
serve
that
young
gentleman
first
it
no
joking
matter
said
the
blacksmith
if
i
do
serve
him
so
now
he
be
worse
off
in
his
old
age
he
come
to
the
gallows
as
sure
as
his
name
is
bill
mind
what
his
name
and
so
saying
he
gave
the
urchin
another
cut
which
elicited
of
course
another
scream
oh
his
name
is
bill
said
captain
wood
his
name
not
bill
said
the
blacksmith
sulkily
he
no
name
and
no
heart
neither
my
wife
took
the
brat
in
seven
years
ago
from
a
beggarly
french
chap
to
nurse
and
she
kept
him
for
she
was
a
good
soul
here
his
eyes
began
to
wink
and
she
she
gone
now
here
he
began
fairly
to
blubber
and
d
him
out
of
love
for
her
i
kept
him
too
and
the
scoundrel
is
a
liar
and
a
thief
this
blessed
day
merely
to
vex
me
and
my
boys
here
he
spoke
ill
of
her
he
did
and
i
cut
his
life
out
i
will
and
with
each
word
honest
mulciber
applied
a
whack
on
the
body
of
little
tom
billings
who
by
shrill
shrieks
and
oaths
in
treble
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
the
blows
come
come
said
wood
set
the
boy
down
and
the
bellows
my
horse
wants
shoeing
and
the
poor
lad
has
had
strapping
the
blacksmith
obeyed
and
cast
poor
master
thomas
loose
as
he
staggered
away
and
looked
back
at
his
tormentor
his
countenance
assumed
an
expression
which
made
wood
say
grasping
hold
of
arm
it
the
boy
it
the
boy
when
his
mother
gave
galgenstein
the
laudanum
she
had
the
look
with
her
had
she
really
now
said
macshane
and
pree
meejor
who
was
his
mother
mrs
cat
you
fool
answered
wood
then
upon
my
secred
word
of
honour
she
has
a
mighty
fine
kitten
anyhow
my
dear
aha
they
do
drown
such
kittens
said
wood
archly
and
macshane
taking
the
allusion
clapped
his
finger
to
his
nose
in
token
of
perfect
approbation
of
his
commander
sentiment
while
the
blacksmith
was
shoeing
the
horse
wood
asked
him
many
questions
concerning
the
lad
whom
he
had
just
been
chastising
and
succeeded
beyond
a
doubt
in
establishing
his
identity
with
the
child
whom
catherine
hall
had
brought
into
the
world
seven
years
since
billings
told
him
of
all
the
virtues
of
his
wife
and
the
manifold
crimes
of
the
lad
how
he
stole
and
fought
and
lied
and
swore
and
though
the
youngest
under
his
roof
exercised
the
most
baneful
influence
over
all
the
rest
of
his
family
he
was
determined
at
last
he
said
to
put
him
to
the
parish
for
he
did
not
dare
to
keep
him
he
a
fine
whelp
and
would
fetch
ten
pieces
in
virginny
sighed
the
ensign
crimp
of
bristol
would
give
five
for
him
said
wood
ruminating
why
not
take
him
said
the
ensign
faith
why
not
said
wood
his
keep
meanwhile
will
not
be
sixpence
a
then
turning
round
to
the
blacksmith
mr
billings
said
he
you
will
be
surprised
perhaps
to
hear
that
i
know
everything
regarding
that
poor
lad
history
his
mother
was
an
unfortunate
lady
of
high
family
now
no
more
his
father
a
german
nobleman
count
de
galgenstein
by
the
very
man
said
billings
a
young
man
who
came
here
with
the
child
and
a
dragoon
count
de
galgenstein
by
name
who
on
the
point
of
death
recommended
the
infant
to
and
did
he
pay
you
seven
years
boarding
said
billings
who
was
quite
alive
at
the
very
idea
alas
sir
not
a
jot
he
died
sir
six
hundred
pounds
in
my
debt
did
he
ensign
six
hundred
upon
my
secred
honour
i
remember
when
he
got
into
the
house
along
with
the
poli
psha
what
matters
it
here
broke
out
wood
looking
fiercely
at
the
ensign
six
hundred
pounds
he
owes
me
how
was
he
to
pay
you
but
he
told
me
to
take
charge
of
this
boy
if
i
found
him
and
found
him
i
have
and
will
take
charge
of
him
if
you
will
hand
him
send
our
tom
cried
billings
and
when
that
youth
appeared
scowling
and
yet
trembling
and
prepared
as
it
seemed
for
another
castigation
his
father
to
his
surprise
asked
him
if
he
was
willing
to
go
along
with
those
gentlemen
or
whether
he
would
be
a
good
lad
and
stay
with
him
tom
replied
immediately
i
wo
be
a
good
lad
and
i
rather
go
to
than
stay
with
you
will
you
leave
your
brothers
and
sisters
said
billings
looking
very
dismal
hang
my
brothers
and
sisters
i
hate
and
besides
i
have
got
any
but
you
had
a
good
mother
had
you
tom
tom
paused
for
a
moment
mother
gone
said
he
and
you
flog
me
and
i
go
with
these
well
then
go
thy
ways
said
billings
starting
up
in
a
passion
go
thy
ways
for
a
graceless
reprobate
and
if
this
gentleman
will
take
you
he
may
do
after
some
further
parley
the
conversation
ended
and
the
next
morning
wood
party
consisted
of
three
a
little
boy
being
mounted
upon
the
bay
horse
in
addition
to
the
ensign
or
himself
and
the
whole
company
went
journeying
towards
bristol
we
have
said
that
hayes
had
on
a
sudden
taken
a
fit
of
maternal
affection
and
was
bent
upon
being
restored
to
her
child
and
that
benign
destiny
which
watched
over
the
life
of
this
lucky
lady
instantly
set
about
gratifying
her
wish
and
without
cost
to
herself
of
or
sent
the
young
gentleman
very
quickly
to
her
arms
the
village
in
which
the
hayeses
dwelt
was
but
a
very
few
miles
out
of
the
road
from
bristol
whither
on
the
benevolent
mission
above
hinted
at
our
party
of
worthies
were
bound
and
coming
towards
the
afternoon
in
sight
of
the
house
of
that
very
justice
ballance
who
had
been
so
nearly
the
ruin
of
ensign
macshane
that
officer
narrated
for
the
hundredth
time
and
with
much
glee
the
circumstances
which
had
then
befallen
him
and
the
manner
in
which
hayes
the
elder
had
come
forward
to
his
rescue
suppose
we
go
and
see
the
old
girl
suggested
wood
no
harm
can
come
to
us
and
his
comrade
always
assenting
they
wound
their
way
towards
the
village
and
reached
it
as
the
evening
came
on
in
the
where
they
rested
wood
made
inquiries
concerning
the
hayes
family
was
informed
of
the
death
of
the
old
couple
of
the
establishment
of
john
hayes
and
his
wife
in
their
place
and
of
the
kind
of
life
that
these
latter
led
together
when
all
these
points
had
been
imparted
to
him
he
ruminated
much
an
expression
of
sublime
triumph
and
exultation
at
length
lighted
up
his
features
i
think
tim
said
he
at
last
that
we
can
make
more
than
five
pieces
of
that
oh

said
timothy
macshane
esquire
who
always
agreed
with
his
in
coorse

glad
to

or

any
rate
hayes
himself
will
be
ashamed
at
finding
his
wife
the
mother
of
a
child
a
year
older
than
his
marriage
and
will
pay
for
the
keeping
of
the
brat
away
there
profit
my
dear
in
any
one
of
the
cases
or
my
name
not
peter
when
the
ensign
understood
this
wondrous
argument
he
would
fain
have
fallen
on
his
knees
and
worshipped
his
friend
and
guide
they
began
operations
almost
immediately
by
an
attack
on
hayes
on
hearing
as
she
did
in
private
interview
with
the
the
next
morning
that
her
son
was
found
she
was
agitated
by
both
of
the
passions
which
wood
attributed
to
her
she
longed
to
have
the
boy
back
and
would
give
any
reasonable
sum
to
see
him
but
she
dreaded
exposure
and
would
pay
equally
to
avoid
that
how
could
she
gain
the
one
point
and
escape
the
other
hayes
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
i
am
given
to
understand
is
not
uncommon
nowadays
she
suddenly
discovered
that
she
had
a
dear
brother
who
had
been
obliged
to
fly
the
country
in
consequence
of
having
joined
the
pretender
and
had
died
in
france
leaving
behind
him
an
only
son
this
boy
her
brother
had
with
his
last
breath
recommended
to
her
protection
and
had
confided
him
to
the
charge
of
a
brother
officer
who
was
now
in
the
country
and
would
speedily
make
his
appearance
and
to
put
the
story
beyond
a
doubt
wood
wrote
the
letter
from
her
brother
stating
all
these
particulars
and
ensign
macshane
received
full
instructions
how
to
perform
the
part
of
the
brother
what
consideration
wood
received
for
his
services
we
can
not
say
only
it
is
well
known
that
hayes
caused
to
be
committed
to
gaol
a
young
apprentice
in
his
service
charged
with
having
broken
open
a
cupboard
in
which
hayes
had
forty
guineas
in
gold
and
silver
and
to
which
none
but
he
and
his
wife
had
access
having
made
these
arrangements
the
corporal
and
his
little
party
decamped
to
a
short
distance
and
catherine
was
left
to
prepare
her
husband
for
a
speedy
addition
to
his
family
in
the
shape
of
this
darling
nephew
john
hayes
received
the
news
with
anything
but
pleasure
he
had
never
heard
of
any
brother
of
catherine
she
had
been
bred
at
the
workhouse
and
nobody
ever
hinted
that
she
had
relatives
but
it
is
easy
for
a
lady
of
moderate
genius
to
invent
circumstances
and
with
lies
tears
threats
coaxings
oaths
and
other
blandishments
she
compelled
him
to
submit
two
days
afterwards
as
hayes
was
working
in
his
shop
with
his
lady
seated
beside
him
the
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
in
his
courtyard
and
a
gentleman
of
huge
stature
descended
from
it
and
strode
into
the
shop
his
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
but
hayes
could
not
help
fancying
that
he
had
somewhere
seen
his
face
before
this
i
preshoom
said
the
gentleman
is
misther
hayes
that
i
have
come
so
many
miles
to
see
and
this
is
his
amiable
lady
i
was
the
most
intimate
frind
madam
of
your
laminted
brother
who
died
in
king
lewis
service
and
whose
last
touching
letthers
i
despatched
to
you
two
days
ago
i
have
with
me
a
further
precious
token
of
my
dear
friend
captain
hall
it
is
and
so
saying
the
military
gentleman
with
one
arm
removed
his
cloak
and
stretching
forward
the
other
into
hayes
face
almost
stretched
likewise
forward
a
little
boy
grinning
and
sprawling
in
the
air
and
prevented
only
from
falling
to
the
ground
by
the
hold
which
the
ensign
kept
of
the
waistband
of
his
little
coat
and
breeches
is
he
a
pretty
boy
said
hayes
sidling
up
to
her
husband
tenderly
and
pressing
one
of
hayes
hands
about
the
lad
beauty
it
is
needless
to
say
what
the
carpenter
thought
but
that
night
and
for
many
many
nights
after
the
lad
stayed
at
hayes
chapter

enumerates
the
accomplishments
of
master

billings
introduces
brock
as

and
announces
the
execution
of
ensign
macshane
we
are
obliged
in
recording
this
history
to
follow
accurately
that
great
authority
the
calendarium
newgaticum
roagorumque
registerium
of
which
every
lover
of
literature
in
the
present
day
knows
the
value
and
as
that
remarkable
work
totally
discards
all
the
unities
in
its
narratives
and
reckons
the
life
of
its
heroes
only
by
their
actions
and
not
by
periods
of
time
we
must
follow
in
the
wake
of
this
mighty
ark
a
humble
when
it
pauses
we
pause
when
it
runs
ten
knots
an
hour
we
run
with
the
same
celerity
and
as
in
order
to
carry
the
reader
from
the
penultimate
chapter
of
this
work
unto
the
last
chapter
we
were
compelled
to
make
him
leap
over
a
gap
of
seven
blank
years
ten
years
more
must
likewise
be
granted
to
us
before
we
are
at
liberty
to
resume
our
history
during
that
period
master
thomas
billings
had
been
under
the
especial
care
of
his
mother
and
as
may
be
imagined
he
rather
increased
than
diminished
the
accomplishments
for
which
he
had
been
remarkable
while
under
the
roof
of
his
and
with
this
advantage
that
while
at
the
blacksmith
and
only
three
or
four
years
of
age
his
virtues
were
necessarily
appreciated
only
in
his
family
circle
and
among
those
few
acquaintances
of
his
own
time
of
life
whom
a
youth
of
three
can
be
expected
to
meet
in
the
alleys
or
over
the
gutters
of
a
small
country
hamlet
in
his
mothers
residence
his
circle
extended
with
his
own
growth
and
he
began
to
give
proofs
of
those
powers
of
which
in
infancy
there
had
been
only
encouraging
indications
thus
it
was
nowise
remarkable
that
a
child
of
four
years
should
not
know
his
letters
and
should
have
had
a
great
disinclination
to
learn
them
but
when
a
young
man
of
fifteen
showed
the
same
creditable
ignorance
the
same
undeviating
dislike
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
possessed
much
resolution
and
perseverance
when
it
was
remarked
too
that
in
case
of
any
difference
he
not
only
beat
the
usher
but
by
no
means
disdained
to
torment
and
bully
the
very
smallest
boys
of
the
school
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
mind
was
comprehensive
and
careful
as
well
as
courageous
and
grasping
as
it
was
said
of
the
duke
of
wellington
in
the
peninsula
that
he
had
a
thought
for
everybody
from
lord
hill
to
the
smallest
drummer
in
the
army
in
like
manner
tom
billings
bestowed
his
attention
on
high
and
low
but
in
the
shape
of
blows
he
would
fight
the
strongest
and
kick
the
smallest
and
was
always
at
work
with
one
or
the
other
at
thirteen
when
he
was
removed
from
the
establishment
whither
he
had
been
sent
he
was
the
cock
of
the
school
out
of
doors
and
the
very
last
boy
in
he
used
to
let
the
little
boys
and
pass
him
by
and
laugh
but
he
always
belaboured
them
unmercifully
afterwards
and
then
it
was
he
said
his
turn
to
laugh
with
such
a
pugnacious
turn
tom
billings
ought
to
have
been
made
a
soldier
and
might
have
died
a
marshal
but
by
an
unlucky
ordinance
of
fate
he
was
made
a
tailor
and
died
a
never
mind
what
for
the
present
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
was
suddenly
cut
off
at
a
very
early
period
of
his
existence
by
a
disease
which
has
exercised
considerable
ravages
among
the
british
youth
by
consulting
the
authority
above
mentioned
we
find
that
hayes
did
not
confine
himself
to
the
profession
of
a
carpenter
or
remain
long
established
in
the
country
but
was
induced
by
the
eager
spirit
of
catherine
most
probably
to
try
his
fortune
in
the
metropolis
where
he
lived
flourished
and
died
oxford
road
saint
giles
and
tottenham
court
were
at
various
periods
of
his
residence
in
town
inhabited
by
him
at
one
place
he
carried
on
the
business
of
greengrocer
and
in
another
he
was
carpenter
undertaker
and
lender
of
money
to
the
poor
finally
he
was
a
keeper
in
the
oxford
or
tyburn
road
but
continued
to
exercise
the
charitable
profession
lending
as
he
did
upon
pledges
and
carrying
on
a
pretty
large
trade
it
was
not
for
him
of
course
to
inquire
into
the
pedigree
of
all
the
pieces
of
plate
the
bales
of
cloth
swords
watches
wigs
etc
that
were
confided
by
his
friends
to
his
keeping
but
it
is
clear
that
his
friends
had
the
requisite
confidence
in
him
and
that
he
enjoyed
the
esteem
of
a
class
of
characters
who
still
live
in
history
and
are
admired
unto
this
very
day
the
mind
loves
to
think
that
perhaps
in
hayes
back
parlour
the
gallant
turpin
might
have
with
catherine
that
here
perhaps
the
noble
sheppard
might
have
cracked
his
joke
or
quaffed
his
pint
of
rum
who
knows
but
that
macheath
and
paul
clifford
may
have
crossed
legs
under
hayes
but
why
pause
to
speculate
on
things
that
might
have
been
why
desert
reality
for
fond
imagination
or
call
up
from
their
honoured
graves
the
sacred
dead
i
know
not
and
yet
in
sooth
i
can
never
pass
cumberland
gate
without
a
sigh
as
i
think
of
the
gallant
cavaliers
who
traversed
that
road
in
old
time
pious
priests
accompanied
their
triumphs
their
chariots
were
surrounded
by
hosts
of
glittering
as
the
slave
at
the
car
of
the
roman
conqueror
shouted
remember
thou
art
mortal
before
the
eyes
of
the
british
warrior
rode
the
undertaker
and
his
coffin
telling
him
that
he
too
must
die
mark
well
the
spot
a
hundred
years
ago
albion
street
where
comic
power
dwelt
milesia
darling
son
albion
street
was
a
desert
the
square
of
connaught
was
without
its
penultimate
and
strictly
speaking
naught
the
edgware
road
was
then
a
road
is
true
with
tinkling
waggons
passing
now
and
then
and
fragrant
walls
of
snowy
hawthorn
blossoms
the
ploughman
whistled
over
nutford
place
down
the
green
solitudes
of
sovereign
street
the
merry
milkmaid
led
the
lowing
kine
here
then
in
the
midst
of
green
fields
and
sweet
air
before
ever
omnibuses
were
and
when
pineapple
turnpike
and
terrace
were
alike
unknown
here
stood
tyburn
and
on
the
road
towards
it
perhaps
to
enjoy
the
prospect
stood
in
the
year
the
habitation
of
john
hayes
one
fine
morning
in
the
year
hayes
who
had
been
abroad
in
her
best
hat
and
hayes
who
for
a
wonder
had
accompanied
her
and
springatt
a
lodger
who
for
a
remuneration
had
the
honour
of
sharing
hayes
friendship
and
table
all
returned
smiling
and
rosy
at
about
ten
from
a
walk
which
they
had
taken
to
bayswater
many
thousands
of
people
were
likewise
seen
flocking
down
the
oxford
road
and
you
would
rather
have
thought
from
the
smartness
of
their
appearance
and
the
pleasure
depicted
in
their
countenances
that
they
were
just
issuing
from
a
sermon
than
quitting
the
ceremony
which
they
had
been
to
attend
the
fact
is
that
they
had
just
been
to
see
a
gentleman
hanged
a
cheap
pleasure
which
the
hayes
family
never
denied
themselves
and
they
returned
home
with
a
good
appetite
to
breakfast
braced
by
the
walk
and
tickled
into
hunger
as
it
were
by
the
spectacle
i
can
recollect
when
i
was
a
gyp
at
cambridge
that
the
men
used
to
have
for
the
very
same
purpose
and
the
exhibition
of
the
morning
acted
infallibly
upon
the
stomach
and
caused
the
young
students
to
eat
with
much
voracity
well
catherine
a
handsome
plump
rosy
woman
of
three
or
four
and
thirty
and
when
my
dear
is
a
woman
handsomer
than
at
that
age
came
in
quite
merrily
from
her
walk
and
entered
the
which
looked
into
a
pleasant
yard
or
garden
whereon
the
sun
was
shining
very
gaily
and
where
at
a
table
covered
with
a
nice
white
cloth
laid
out
with
some
silver
mugs
too
and
knives
all
with
different
crests
and
patterns
sat
an
old
gentleman
reading
in
an
old
book
here
we
are
at
last
doctor
said
hayes
and
here
his
she
produced
the
little
halfpenny
tract
which
to
this
day
is
sold
at
the
upon
the
death
of
every
offender
i
seen
a
many
men
turned
off
to
be
sure
but
i
never
did
see
one
who
bore
it
more
like
a
man
than
he
my
dear
said
the
gentleman
addressed
as
doctor
he
was
as
cool
and
as
brave
as
steel
and
no
more
minded
hanging
than
it
was
the
drink
that
ruined
him
said
cat
drink
and
bad
company
i
warned
him
my
dear
i
warned
him
years
ago
and
directly
he
got
into
wild
gang
i
knew
that
he
had
not
a
year
to
run
ah
why
my
love
will
men
continue
such
dangerous
courses
continued
the
doctor
with
a
sigh
and
jeopardy
their
lives
for
a
miserable
watch
or
a
of
which
wild
takes
of
the
produce
but
here
comes
the
breakfast
and
egad
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
lad
of
indeed
at
this
moment
hayes
servant
appeared
with
a
smoking
dish
of
bacon
and
greens
and
hayes
himself
ascended
from
the
cellar
of
which
he
kept
the
key
bearing
with
him
a
tolerably
large
jug
of
to
this
repast
the
doctor
springatt
the
other
lodger
and
and
hayes
proceeded
with
great
alacrity
a
fifth
cover
was
laid
but
not
used
the
company
remarking
that
tom
had
very
likely
found
some
acquaintances
at
tyburn
with
whom
he
might
choose
to
pass
the
tom
was
master
thomas
billings
now
of
the
age
of
sixteen
slim
smart
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
handsome
sallow
in
complexion
and
billings
was
apprentice
to
a
tailor
of
tolerable
practice
who
was
to
take
him
into
partnership
at
the
end
of
his
term
it
was
supposed
and
with
reason
that
tom
would
not
fail
to
make
a
fortune
in
this
business
of
which
the
present
head
was
one
beinkleider
a
german
beinkleider
was
skilful
in
his
trade
after
the
manner
of
his
nation
which
in
breeches
and
metaphysics
in
inexpressibles
and
incomprehensibles
may
instruct
all
europe
but
too
fond
of
his
pleasure
some
promissory
notes
of
his
had
found
their
way
into
hayes
hands
and
had
given
him
the
means
not
only
of
providing
master
billings
with
a
cheap
apprenticeship
and
a
cheap
partnership
afterwards
but
would
empower
him
in
one
or
two
years
after
the
young
partner
had
joined
the
firm
to
eject
the
old
one
altogether
so
that
there
was
every
prospect
that
when
billings
was
years
of
age
poor
beinkleider
would
have
to
act
not
as
his
master
but
his
journeyman
tom
was
a
very
precocious
youth
was
supplied
by
a
doting
mother
with
plenty
of
and
spent
it
with
a
number
of
lively
companions
of
both
sexes
at
plays
fairs
jolly
parties
on
the
river
and
innocent
amusements
he
could
throw
a
main
too
as
well
as
his
elders
had
pinked
his
man
in
a
row
at
madam
king
in
the
piazza
and
was
much
respected
at
the
roundhouse
hayes
was
not
very
fond
of
this
promising
young
gentleman
indeed
he
had
the
baseness
to
bear
malice
because
in
a
quarrel
which
occurred
about
two
years
previously
he
hayes
being
desirous
to
chastise
billings
had
found
himself
not
only
quite
incompetent
but
actually
at
the
mercy
of
the
boy
who
struck
him
over
the
head
with
a
felled
him
to
the
ground
and
swore
he
would
have
his
life
the
doctor
who
was
then
also
a
lodger
at
hayes
interposed
and
restored
the
combatants
not
to
friendship
but
to
peace
hayes
never
afterwards
attempted
to
lift
his
hand
to
the
young
man
but
contented
himself
with
hating
him
profoundly
in
this
sentiment
billings
participated
cordially
and
quite
unlike
hayes
who
never
dared
to
show
his
dislike
used
on
every
occasion
when
they
met
by
actions
looks
words
sneers
and
curses
to
let
his
stepfather
know
the
opinion
which
he
had
of
him
why
did
not
hayes
discard
the
boy
altogether
because
if
he
did
so
he
was
really
afraid
of
his
life
and
because
he
trembled
before
hayes
his
lady
as
the
leaf
trembles
before
the
tempest
in
october
his
breath
was
not
his
own
but
hers
his
money
too
had
been
chiefly
of
her
getting
for
though
he
was
as
stingy
and
mean
as
mortal
man
can
be
and
so
likely
to
save
much
he
had
not
the
genius
for
getting
which
hayes
possessed
she
kept
his
books
for
she
had
learned
to
read
and
write
by
this
time
she
made
his
bargains
and
she
directed
the
operations
of
the
little
capitalist
when
bills
became
due
and
debtors
pressed
for
time
then
she
brought
own
professional
merits
into
play
the
man
was
as
deaf
and
cold
as
a
rock
never
did
poor
tradesmen
gain
a
penny
from
him
never
were
the
bailiffs
delayed
one
single
minute
from
their
prey
the
beinkleider
business
for
instance
showed
pretty
well
the
genius
of
the
two
hayes
was
for
closing
with
him
at
once
but
his
wife
saw
the
vast
profits
which
might
be
drawn
out
of
him
and
arranged
the
apprenticeship
and
the
partnership
before
alluded
to
the
woman
heartily
scorned
and
spit
upon
her
husband
who
fawned
upon
her
like
a
spaniel
she
loved
good
cheer
she
did
not
want
for
a
certain
kind
of
generosity
the
only
feeling
that
hayes
had
for
anyone
except
himself
was
for
his
wife
whom
he
held
in
a
cowardly
awe
and
attachment
he
liked
drink
too
which
made
him
chirping
and
merry
and
accepted
willingly
any
treats
that
his
acquaintances
might
offer
him
but
he
would
suffer
agonies
when
his
wife
brought
or
ordered
from
the
cellar
a
bottle
of
wine
and
now
for
the
doctor
he
was
about
seventy
years
of
age
he
had
been
much
abroad
he
was
of
a
sober
cheerful
aspect
he
dressed
handsomely
and
quietly
in
a
broad
hat
and
cassock
but
saw
no
company
except
the
few
friends
whom
he
met
at
the
he
had
an
income
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
which
he
promised
to
leave
to
young
billings
he
was
amused
with
the
lad
and
fond
of
his
mother
and
had
boarded
with
them
for
some
years
past
the
doctor
in
fact
was
our
old
friend
corporal
brock
the
reverend
doctor
wood
now
as
he
had
been
major
wood
fifteen
years
back
anyone
who
has
read
the
former
part
of
this
history
must
have
seen
that
we
have
spoken
throughout
with
invariable
respect
of
brock
and
that
in
every
circumstance
in
which
he
has
appeared
he
has
acted
not
only
with
prudence
but
often
with
genius
the
early
obstacle
to
success
was
want
of
conduct
simply
drink
women
play
how
many
a
brave
fellow
have
they
ruined
had
pulled
brock
down
as
often
as
his
merit
had
carried
him
up
when
a
man
passion
for
play
has
brought
him
to
be
a
scoundrel
it
at
once
ceases
to
be
hurtful
to
him
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
he
cheats
and
wins
it
is
only
for
the
idle
and
luxurious
that
women
retain
their
fascinations
to
a
very
late
period
and
passions
had
been
whipped
out
of
him
in
virginia
where
much
hard
labour
and
hard
food
speedily
put
an
end
to
them
he
forgot
there
even
how
to
drink
rum
or
wine
made
this
poor
declining
gentleman
so
ill
that
he
could
indulge
in
them
no
longer
and
so
his
three
vices
were
cured
had
he
been
ambitious
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
brock
on
his
return
from
transportation
might
have
risen
in
the
world
but
he
was
old
and
a
philosopher
he
did
not
care
about
rising
living
was
cheaper
in
those
days
and
interest
for
money
higher
when
he
had
amassed
about
six
hundred
pounds
he
purchased
an
annuity
of
pounds
and
gave
out
why
should
he
not
that
he
had
the
capital
as
well
as
the
interest
after
leaving
the
hayes
family
in
the
country
he
found
them
again
in
london
he
took
up
his
abode
with
them
and
was
attached
to
the
mother
and
the
son
do
you
suppose
that
rascals
have
not
affections
like
other
people
hearts
madam
ay
hearts
and
family
ties
which
they
cherish
as
the
doctor
lived
on
with
this
charming
family
he
began
to
regret
that
he
had
sunk
all
his
money
in
annuities
and
could
not
as
he
repeatedly
vowed
he
would
leave
his
savings
to
his
adopted
children
he
felt
an
indescribable
pleasure
suave
mari
magno
etc
in
watching
the
storms
and
tempests
of
the
hayes
menage
he
used
to
encourage
catherine
into
anger
when
haply
that
lady
fits
of
calm
would
last
too
long
he
used
to
warm
up
the
disputes
between
wife
and
husband
mother
and
son
and
enjoy
them
beyond
expression
they
served
him
for
daily
amusement
and
he
used
to
laugh
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
venerable
cheeks
at
the
accounts
which
young
tom
continually
brought
him
of
his
pranks
abroad
among
watchmen
and
constables
at
taverns
or
elsewhere
when
therefore
as
the
party
were
discussing
their
bacon
and
cabbage
before
which
the
reverend
doctor
with
much
gravity
said
grace
master
tom
entered
doctor
wood
who
had
before
been
rather
gloomy
immediately
brightened
up
and
made
a
place
for
billings
between
himself
and
catherine
how
do
old
cock
said
that
young
gentleman
familiarly
how
goes
it
mother
and
so
saying
he
seized
eagerly
upon
the
jug
of
beer
which
hayes
had
drawn
and
from
which
the
latter
was
about
to
help
himself
and
poured
down
his
throat
exactly
one
quart
ah
said
billings
drawing
breath
after
a
draught
which
he
had
learned
accurately
to
gauge
from
the
habit
of
drinking
out
of
pewter
measures
which
held
precisely
that
ah
said
billings
drawing
breath
and
wiping
his
mouth
with
his
sleeves
this
is
very
thin
stuff
old
squaretoes
but
my
coppers
have
been
since
last
night
and
they
wanted
a
should
you
like
some
ale
dear
said
hayes
that
fond
and
judicious
parent
a
quart
of
brandy
tom
said
doctor
wood
your
papa
will
run
down
to
the
cellar
for
it
in
a
i
see
him
hanged
first
cried
hayes
quite
frightened
oh
fie
now
you
unnatural
father
said
the
doctor
the
very
name
of
father
used
to
put
hayes
in
a
fury
i
not
his
father
thank
heaven
said
he
no
nor
nobody
else
said
tom
hayes
only
muttered
brat
his
father
was
a
gentleman
that
more
than
you
ever
were
screamed
hayes
his
father
was
a
man
of
spirit
no
cowardly
sneak
of
a
carpenter
mr
hayes
tom
has
noble
blood
in
his
veins
for
all
he
has
a
tailor
appearance
and
if
his
mother
had
had
her
right
she
would
be
now
in
a
i
wish
i
could
find
my
father
said
tom
for
i
think
polly
briggs
and
i
would
look
mighty
well
in
a
tom
fancied
that
if
his
father
was
a
count
at
the
time
of
his
birth
he
must
be
a
prince
now
and
indeed
went
among
his
companions
by
the
latter
august
title
ay
tom
that
you
would
cried
his
mother
looking
at
him
fondly
with
a
sword
by
my
side
and
a
hat
and
feather
there
never
a
lord
at
james
would
cut
a
finer
after
a
little
more
of
this
talk
in
which
hayes
let
the
company
know
her
high
opinion
of
her
son
who
as
usual
took
care
to
show
his
extreme
contempt
for
his
stepfather
the
latter
retired
to
his
occupations
the
lodger
springatt
who
had
never
said
a
word
all
this
time
retired
to
her
apartment
on
the
second
floor
and
pulling
out
their
pipes
and
tobacco
the
old
gentleman
and
the
young
one
solaced
themselves
with
more
talk
and
smoking
while
the
thrifty
hayes
opposite
to
them
was
busy
with
her
books
what
in
the
confessions
said
billings
to
doctor
wood
there
were
six
of
besides
mac
two
for
sheep
four
housebreakers
but
nothing
of
consequence
i
there
the
paper
said
wood
archly
read
for
yourself
tom
looked
at
the
same
time
very
fierce
and
very
foolish
for
though
he
could
drink
swear
and
fight
as
well
as
any
lad
of
his
inches
in
england
reading
was
not
among
his
accomplishments
i
tell
you
what
doctor
said
he
you
have
no
bantering
with
me
for
i
not
the
man
that
will
bear
it
me
and
he
threw
a
tremendous
swaggering
look
across
the
table
i
want
you
to
learn
to
read
tommy
dear
look
at
your
mother
there
over
her
books
she
keeps
them
as
neat
as
a
scrivener
now
and
at
twenty
she
could
make
never
a
your
godfather
speaks
for
your
good
child
and
for
me
thou
knowest
that
i
have
promised
thee
a
cane
and
periwig
on
the
first
day
that
thou
canst
read
me
a
column
of
the
flying
hang
the
periwig
said
tom
testily
let
my
godfather
read
the
paper
himself
if
he
has
a
liking
for
whereupon
the
old
gentleman
put
on
his
spectacles
and
glanced
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
ornamented
with
a
picture
of
a
gallows
at
the
top
contained
the
biographies
of
the
seven
unlucky
individuals
who
had
that
morning
suffered
the
penalty
of
the
law
with
the
six
heroes
who
came
first
in
the
list
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
have
before
us
a
copy
of
the
paper
containing
the
life
of
no
and
which
the
doctor
read
in
an
audible
voice
captain
macshane
the
seventh
victim
to
his
own
crimes
was
the
famous
highwayman
captain
macshane
so
well
known
as
the
irish
the
captain
came
to
the
ground
in
a
fine
white
lawn
shirt
and
nightcap
and
being
a
papist
in
his
religion
was
attended
by
father
popish
priest
and
chaplain
to
the
bavarian
envoy
captain
macshane
was
born
of
respectable
parents
in
the
town
of
clonakilty
in
ireland
being
descended
from
most
of
the
kings
in
that
country
he
had
the
honour
of
serving
their
majesties
king
william
and
queen
mary
and
her
majesty
queen
anne
in
flanders
and
spain
and
obtained
much
credit
from
my
lords
marlborough
and
peterborough
for
his
valour
but
being
placed
on
at
the
end
of
the
war
ensign
macshane
took
to
evil
courses
and
frequenting
the
bagnios
and
was
speedily
brought
to
ruin
being
at
this
pass
he
fell
in
with
the
notorious
captain
wood
and
they
two
together
committed
many
atrocious
robberies
in
the
inland
counties
but
these
being
too
hot
to
hold
them
they
went
into
the
west
where
they
were
unknown
here
however
the
day
of
retribution
arrived
for
having
stolen
three
from
a
they
under
false
names
were
tried
at
exeter
and
transported
for
seven
years
beyond
the
sea
thus
it
is
seen
that
justice
never
sleeps
but
sooner
or
latter
is
sure
to
overtake
the
criminal
on
their
return
from
virginia
a
quarrel
about
booty
arose
between
these
two
and
macshane
killed
wood
in
a
combat
that
took
place
between
them
near
to
the
town
of
bristol
but
a
waggon
coming
up
macshane
was
obliged
to
fly
without
the
wealth
so
true
is
it
that
wickedness
never
prospers
two
days
afterwards
macshane
met
the
coach
of
miss
macraw
a
scotch
lady
and
heiress
going
for
lumbago
and
gout
to
the
bath
he
at
first
would
have
robbed
this
lady
but
such
were
his
arts
that
he
induced
her
to
marry
him
and
they
lived
together
for
seven
years
in
the
town
of
eddenboro
in
scotland
he
passing
under
the
name
of
colonel
geraldine
the
lady
dying
and
macshane
having
expended
all
her
wealth
he
was
obliged
to
resume
his
former
evil
courses
in
order
to
save
himself
from
starvation
whereupon
he
robbed
a
scotch
lord
by
name
the
lord
of
whistlebinkie
of
a
mull
of
snuff
for
which
crime
he
was
condemned
to
the
tolbooth
prison
at
eddenboro
in
scotland
and
whipped
many
times
in
publick
these
deserved
punishments
did
not
at
all
alter
captain
disposition
and
on
the
of
february
last
he
stopped
the
bavarian
envoy
coach
on
blackheath
coming
from
dover
and
robbed
his
excellency
and
his
chaplain
taking
from
the
former
his
money
watches
star
a
his
sword
a
very
valuable
one
and
from
the
latter
a
romish
missal
out
of
which
he
was
then
reading
and
a
the
bavarian
envoy
said
tom
parenthetically
my
master
beinkleider
was
his
lordship
regimental
tailor
in
germany
and
is
now
making
a
court
suit
for
him
it
will
be
a
matter
of
a
hundred
pounds
to
him
i
doctor
wood
resumed
his
reading
hum
hum
a
romish
missal
out
of
which
he
was
reading
and
a
by
means
of
the
famous
wild
this
notorious
criminal
was
brought
to
justice
and
the
and
missal
have
been
restored
to
father
during
his
confinement
in
newgate
macshane
could
not
be
brought
to
express
any
contrition
for
his
crimes
except
that
of
having
killed
his
commanding
officer
for
this
wood
he
pretended
an
excessive
sorrow
and
vowed
that
usquebaugh
had
been
the
cause
of
his
death
indeed
in
prison
he
partook
of
no
other
liquor
and
drunk
a
bottle
of
it
on
the
day
before
his
death
he
was
visited
by
several
of
the
clergy
and
gentry
in
his
cell
among
others
by
the
popish
priest
whom
he
had
robbed
father
before
mentioned
who
attended
him
likewise
in
his
last
moments
if
that
idolatrous
worship
may
be
called
attention
and
likewise
by
the
father
patron
the
bavarian
ambassador
his
excellency
count
maximilian
de
as
old
wood
came
to
these
words
he
paused
to
give
them
utterance
what
max
screamed
hayes
letting
her
fall
over
her
ledgers
why
be
hanged
if
it
be
my
father
said
billings
your
father
sure
enough
unless
there
be
others
of
his
name
and
unless
the
scoundrel
is
hanged
said
the
doctor
sinking
his
voice
however
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
billings
broke
his
pipe
in
an
agony
of
joy
i
think
we
have
the
coach
now
mother
says
he
and
i
blessed
if
polly

pair
of
and
so
it
was
agreed
that
in
this
manner
the
son
should
at
first
make
his
appearance
before
his
father
cat
gave
him
the
piece
of
brocade
which
in
the
course
of
the
day
was
fashioned
into
a
smart
waistcoat
for
beinkleider
shop
was
close
by
in
cavendish
square
gretel
with
many
blushes
tied
a
fine
blue
riband
round
his
neck
and
in
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
with
gold
buckles
to
his
shoes
master
billings
looked
a
very
proper
young
gentleman
and
tommy
said
his
mother
blushing
and
hesitating
should
max
should
his
lordship
ask
after
your
want
to
know
if
your
mother
is
alive
you
can
say
she
is
and
well
and
often
talks
of
old
times
and
tommy
after
another
pause
you
need
say
anything
about
hayes
only
say
i
quite
hayes
looked
at
him
as
he
marched
down
the
street
a
long
long
way
tom
was
proud
and
gay
in
his
new
costume
and
was
not
unlike
his
father
as
she
looked
lo
oxford
street
disappeared
and
she
saw
a
green
common
and
a
village
and
a
little
inn
there
was
a
soldier
leading
a
pair
of
horses
about
on
the
green
common
and
in
the
inn
sat
a
cavalier
so
young
so
merry
so
beautiful
oh
what
slim
white
hands
he
had
and
winning
words
and
tender
gentle
blue
eyes
was
it
not
an
honour
to
a
country
lass
that
such
a
noble
gentleman
should
look
at
her
for
a
moment
had
he
not
some
charm
about
him
that
she
must
needs
obey
when
he
whispered
in
her
ear
come
follow
me
as
she
walked
towards
the
lane
that
morning
how
well
she
remembered
each
spot
as
she
passed
it
and
the
look
it
wore
for
the
last
time
how
the
smoke
was
rising
from
the
pastures
how
the
fish
were
jumping
and
plashing
in
the
there
was
the
church
with
all
its
windows
lighted
up
with
gold
and
yonder
were
the
reapers
sweeping
down
the
brown
corn
she
tried
to
sing
as
she
went
up
the
hill
what
was
it
she
could
not
remember
but
oh
how
well
she
remembered
the
sound
of
the
horse
hoofs
as
they
came
quicker
quicker
nearer
nearer
how
noble
he
looked
on
his
great
horse
was
he
thinking
of
her
or
were
they
all
silly
words
which
he
spoke
last
night
merely
to
pass
away
the
time
and
deceive
poor
girls
with
would
he
remember
them
would
he
cat
my
dear
here
cried
brock
alias
captain
alias
doctor
wood
here
the
meat
cold
and
i
am
longing
for
my
as
they
went
in
he
looked
her
hard
in
the
face
what
still
at
it
you
silly
girl
i
been
watching
you
these
five
minutes
cat
and
be
hanged
but
i
think
a
word
from
galgenstein
and
you
would
follow
him
as
a
fly
does
a
they
went
in
to
breakfast
but
though
there
was
a
hot
shoulder
of
mutton
and
catherine
favourite
dish
she
never
touched
a
morsel
of
it
in
the
meanwhile
thomas
billings
in
his
new
clothes
which
his
mamma
had
given
him
in
his
new
riband
which
the
fair
miss
beinkleider
had
tied
round
his
neck
and
having
his
excellency
breeches
wrapped
in
a
silk
handkerchief
in
his
right
hand
turned
down
in
the
direction
of
whitehall
where
the
bavarian
envoy
lodged
but
before
he
waited
on
him
billings
being
excessively
pleased
with
his
personal
appearance
made
an
early
visit
to
briggs
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
swallow
street
and
who
after
expressing
herself
with
much
enthusiasm
regarding
her
tommy
good
looks
immediately
asked
him
what
he
would
stand
to
drink
raspberry
gin
being
suggested
a
pint
of
that
liquor
was
sent
for
and
so
great
was
the
confidence
and
intimacy
subsisting
between
these
two
young
people
that
the
reader
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
polly
accepted
every
shilling
of
the
money
which
tom
billings
had
received
from
his
mamma
the
day
before
nay
could
with
difficulty
be
prevented
from
seizing
upon
the
breeches
which
he
was
carrying
to
the
nobleman
for
whom
they
were
made
having
paid
his
adieux
to
polly
billings
departed
to
visit
his
father
chapter
ix
interview
between
count
galgenstein
and
master
thomas
billings
when
he
informs
the
count
of
his
parentage
i
do
know
in
all
this
miserable
world
a
more
miserable
spectacle
than
that
of
a
young
fellow
of
five
or
six
and
forty
the
british
army
that
nursery
of
valour
turns
out
many
of
the
young
fellows
i
mean
who
having
flaunted
in
dragoon
uniforms
from
seventeen
to
having
bought
sold
or
swapped
during
that
period
some
two
hundred
horses
having
played
say
fifteen
thousand
games
at
billiards
having
drunk
some
six
thousand
bottles
of
wine
having
consumed
a
reasonable
number
of
nugee
coats
split
many
dozen
pairs
of
hoby
boots
and
read
the
newspaper
and
the
duly
retire
from
the
service
when
they
have
attained
their
eighth
lustre
and
saunter
through
the
world
trailing
from
london
to
cheltenham
and
from
boulogne
to
paris
and
from
paris
to
baden
their
idleness
their
and
their
ennui
in
the
morning
of
youth
and
when
seen
along
with
whole
troops
of
their
companions
these
flowers
look
gaudy
and
brilliant
enough
but
there
is
no
object
more
dismal
than
one
of
them
alone
and
in
its
autumnal
or
seedy
state
my
friend
captain
popjoy
is
one
who
has
arrived
at
this
condition
and
whom
everybody
knows
by
his
title
of
father
pop
a
kinder
simpler
more
fellow
does
not
exist
he
is
years
old
and
appears
a
young
man
of
sixty
at
the
time
of
the
army
of
occupation
he
really
was
as
a
man
as
any
in
the
dragoons
he
now
uses
all
sorts
of
stratagems
to
cover
the
bald
place
on
his
head
by
combing
certain
thin
grey
sidelocks
over
it
he
has
in
revenge
a
pair
of
enormous
moustaches
which
he
dyes
of
the
richest
his
nose
is
a
good
deal
larger
and
redder
than
it
used
to
be
his
eyelids
have
grown
flat
and
heavy
and
a
little
pair
of
red
watery
eyeballs
float
in
the
midst
of
them
it
seems
as
if
the
light
which
was
once
in
those
sickly
green
pupils
had
extravasated
into
the
white
part
of
the
eye
if
pop
legs
are
not
so
firm
and
muscular
as
they
used
to
be
in
those
days
when
he
took
such
leaps
into
white
buckskins
in
revenge
his
waist
is
much
larger
he
wears
a
very
good
coat
however
and
a
waistband
which
he
lets
out
after
dinner
before
ladies
he
blushes
and
is
as
silent
as
a
schoolboy
he
calls
them
modest
his
society
is
chiefly
among
young
lads
belonging
to
his
former
profession
he
knows
the
best
wine
to
be
had
at
each
tavern
or
cafe
and
the
waiters
treat
him
with
much
respectful
familiarity
he
knows
the
names
of
every
one
of
them
and
shouts
out
send
markwell
here
or
tell
cuttriss
to
give
us
a
bottle
of
the
yellow
seal
or
dizzy
voo
monsure
borrel
noo
donny
shampang
frappy
etc
he
always
makes
the
salad
or
the
punch
and
dines
out
three
hundred
days
in
the
year
the
other
days
you
see
him
in
a
at
paris
or
prowling
about
rupert
street
or
martin
court
where
you
get
a
capital
cut
of
meat
for
eightpence
he
has
decent
lodgings
and
scrupulously
clean
linen
his
animal
functions
are
still
tolerably
well
preserved
his
spiritual
have
evaporated
long
since
he
sleeps
well
has
no
conscience
believes
himself
to
be
a
respectable
fellow
and
is
tolerably
happy
on
the
days
when
he
is
asked
out
to
dinner
poor
pop
is
not
very
high
in
the
scale
of
created
beings
but
if
you
fancy
there
is
none
lower
you
are
in
egregious
error
there
was
once
a
man
who
had
a
mysterious
exhibition
of
an
animal
quite
unknown
to
naturalists
called
the
those
curious
individuals
who
desired
to
see
the
wusser
were
introduced
into
an
apartment
where
appeared
before
them
nothing
more
than
a
little
lean
shrivelled
hideous
mangy
pig
everyone
cried
out
swindle
and
shame
patience
gentlemen
be
heasy
said
the
showman
look
at
that
there
hanimal
it
a
perfect
phenomaly
of
hugliness
i
engage
you
never
see
such
a
nobody
ever
had
seen
now
gentlemen
said
he
i
keep
my
promise
has
per
bill
and
bad
as
that
there
pig
is
look
at
this
here
he
showed
another
look
at
this
here
and
you
see
at
once
that
it
a
in
like
manner
the
popjoy
breed
is
bad
enough
but
it
serves
only
to
show
off
the
galgenstein
race
which
is
wusser
galgenstein
had
led
a
very
gay
life
as
the
saying
is
for
the
last
fifteen
years
such
a
gay
one
that
he
had
lost
all
capacity
of
enjoyment
by
this
time
and
only
possessed
inclinations
without
powers
of
gratifying
them
he
had
grown
to
be
exquisitely
curious
and
fastidious
about
meat
and
drink
for
instance
and
all
that
he
wanted
was
an
appetite
he
carried
about
with
him
a
french
cook
who
could
not
make
him
eat
a
doctor
who
could
not
make
him
well
a
mistress
of
whom
he
was
heartily
sick
after
two
days
a
priest
who
had
been
a
favourite
of
the
exemplary
dubois
and
by
turns
used
to
tickle
him
by
the
imposition
of
penance
or
by
the
repetition
of
a
tale
from
the
recueil
of
noce
or
la
fare
all
his
appetites
were
wasted
and
worn
only
some
monstrosity
would
galvanise
them
into
momentary
action
he
was
in
that
effete
state
to
which
many
noblemen
of
his
time
had
arrived
who
were
ready
to
believe
in
or
in
or
to
retire
into
monasteries
and
wear
or
to
dabble
in
conspiracies
or
to
die
in
love
with
little
of
fifteen
or
to
pine
for
the
smiles
or
at
the
frowns
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
or
to
go
mad
at
the
refusal
of
a
chamberlain
key
the
last
gratification
he
remembered
to
have
enjoyed
was
that
of
riding
bareheaded
in
a
soaking
rain
for
three
hours
by
the
side
of
his
grand
duke
mistress
coach
taking
the
pas
of
count
krahwinkel
who
challenged
him
and
was
run
through
the
body
for
this
very
dispute
galgenstein
gained
a
rheumatic
gout
by
it
which
put
him
to
tortures
for
many
months
and
was
further
gratified
with
the
post
of
english
envoy
he
had
a
fortune
he
asked
no
salary
and
could
look
the
envoy
very
well
father
did
all
the
duties
and
furthermore
acted
as
a
spy
over
the
ambassador
a
sinecure
post
for
the
man
had
no
feelings
wishes
or
opinions
absolutely
none
upon
my
life
father
said
this
worthy
man
i
care
for
nothing
you
have
been
talking
for
an
hour
about
the
regent
death
and
the
duchess
of
phalaris
and
sly
old
fleury
and
what
not
and
i
care
just
as
much
as
if
you
told
me
that
one
of
my
bauers
at
galgenstein
had
killed
a
pig
or
as
if
my
lacquey
la
rose
yonder
had
made
love
to
my
he
does
said
the
reverend
gentleman
ah
monsieur
said
la
rose
who
was
arranging
his
enormous
court
periwig
you
are
helas
wrong
monsieur
le
comte
will
not
be
angry
at
my
saying
that
i
wish
the
accusation
were
the
count
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
of
la
rose
wit
but
continued
his
own
complaints
i
tell
you
abbe
i
care
for
nothing
i
lost
a
thousand
guineas
night
at
basset
i
wish
to
my
heart
i
could
have
been
vexed
about
it
egad
i
remember
the
day
when
to
lose
a
hundred
made
me
half
mad
for
a
month
well
next
day
i
had
my
revenge
at
dice
and
threw
thirteen
mains
there
was
some
delay
a
call
for
fresh
bones
i
think
and
would
you
believe
it
i
fell
asleep
with
the
box
in
my
hand
a
desperate
case
indeed
said
the
abbe
if
it
had
not
been
for
krahwinkel
i
should
have
been
a
dead
man
that
positive
that
pinking
him
saved
i
make
no
doubt
of
it
said
the
abbe
had
your
excellency
not
run
him
through
he
without
a
doubt
would
have
done
the
same
for
psha
you
mistake
my
words
monsieur
yawning
i
mean
what
cursed
chocolate
that
i
was
dying
for
want
of
excitement
not
that
i
cared
for
dying
no
d
me
if
i
do
when
you
do
your
excellency
means
said
the
abbe
a
fat
irishman
from
the
irlandois
college
at
paris
his
excellency
did
not
laugh
nor
understand
jokes
of
any
kind
he
was
of
an
undeviating
stupidity
and
only
replied
sir
i
mean
what
i
say
i
do
care
for
living
no
nor
for
dying
either
but
i
can
speak
as
well
as
another
and
i
thank
you
not
to
be
correcting
my
phrases
as
if
i
were
one
of
your
cursed
schoolboys
and
not
a
gentleman
of
fortune
and
herewith
the
count
who
had
uttered
four
sentences
about
himself
he
never
spoke
of
anything
else
sunk
back
on
his
pillows
again
quite
exhausted
by
his
eloquence
the
abbe
who
had
a
seat
and
a
table
by
the
bedside
resumed
the
labours
which
had
brought
him
into
the
room
in
the
morning
and
busied
himself
with
papers
which
occasionally
he
handed
over
to
his
superior
for
approval
presently
monsieur
la
rose
appeared
here
is
a
person
with
clothes
from
beinkleider
will
your
excellency
see
him
or
shall
i
bid
him
leave
the
clothes
the
count
was
very
much
fatigued
by
this
time
he
had
signed
three
papers
and
read
the
first
lines
of
a
pair
of
them
bid
the
fellow
come
in
la
rose
and
hark
ye
give
me
my
wig
one
must
show
one
self
to
be
a
gentleman
before
these
and
he
therefore
mounted
a
large
pyramid
of
horsehair
which
was
to
awe
the
he
was
a
lad
of
about
seventeen
in
a
smart
waistcoat
and
a
blue
riband
our
friend
tom
billings
indeed
he
carried
under
his
arm
the
destined
breeches
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
awed
however
by
his
excellency
appearance
but
looked
at
him
with
a
great
degree
of
curiosity
and
boldness
in
the
same
manner
he
surveyed
the
chaplain
and
then
nodded
to
him
with
a
kind
look
of
recognition
where
have
i
seen
the
lad
said
the
father
oh
i
have
it
my
good
friend
you
were
at
the
hanging
yesterday
i
think
billings
gave
a
very
significant
nod
with
his
head
i
never
miss
said
he
what
a
young
turk
and
pray
sir
do
you
go
for
pleasure
or
for
business
business
what
do
you
mean
by
business
oh
i
did
not
know
whether
you
might
be
brought
up
to
the
trade
or
your
relations
be
undergoing
the
my
relations
said
billings
proudly
and
staring
the
count
full
in
the
face
was
not
made
for
no
such
thing
i
a
tailor
now
but
a
gentleman
son
as
good
a
man
ay
as
his
lordship
there
for
you
his
lordship
you
the
popish
priest
you
are
and
we
were
very
near
giving
you
a
touch
of
a
few
protestant
stones
the
count
began
to
be
a
little
amused
he
was
pleased
to
see
the
abbe
look
alarmed
or
even
foolish
egad
abbe
said
he
you
turn
as
white
as
a
i
do
fancy
being
murdered
my
lord
said
the
abbe
hastily
and
murdered
for
a
good
work
it
was
but
to
be
useful
to
yonder
poor
irishman
who
saved
me
as
a
prisoner
in
flanders
when
marlborough
would
have
hung
me
up
like
poor
macshane
himself
was
ah
said
the
count
bursting
out
with
some
energy
i
was
thinking
who
the
fellow
could
be
ever
since
he
robbed
me
on
the
heath
i
recollect
the
scoundrel
now
he
was
a
second
in
a
duel
i
had
here
in
the
year
along
with
major
wood
behind
montague
house
said
billings
heard
on
and
here
he
looked
more
knowing
than
ever
you
cried
the
count
more
and
more
surprised
and
pray
who
the
devil
are
you
my
name
billings
said
the
count
i
come
out
of
warwickshire
said
billings
indeed
i
was
born
at
birmingham
were
you
really
my
mother
name
was
hayes
continued
billings
in
a
solemn
voice
i
was
put
out
to
a
nurse
along
with
john
billings
a
blacksmith
and
my
father
run
away
now
do
you
know
who
i
am
why
upon
honour
now
said
the
count
who
was
amused
upon
honour
billings
i
have
not
that
well
then
my
lord
you
my
father
billings
when
he
said
this
came
forward
to
the
count
with
a
theatrical
air
and
flinging
down
the
breeches
of
which
he
was
the
bearer
held
out
his
arms
and
stared
having
very
little
doubt
but
that
his
lordship
would
forthwith
spring
out
of
bed
and
hug
him
to
his
heart
a
similar
piece
of
naivete
many
fathers
of
families
have
i
have
no
doubt
remarked
in
their
children
who
not
caring
for
their
parents
a
single
doit
conceive
nevertheless
that
the
latter
are
bound
to
show
all
sorts
of
affection
for
them
his
lordship
did
move
but
backwards
towards
the
wall
and
began
pulling
at
the
with
an
expression
of
the
most
intense
alarm
keep
back
sirrah
keep
back
suppose
i
am
your
father
do
you
want
to
murder
me
good
heavens
how
the
boy
smells
of
gin
and
tobacco
turn
away
my
lad
sit
down
there
at
a
proper
distance
and
la
rose
give
him
some
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
well
now
go
on
with
your
story
egad
my
dear
abbe
i
think
it
is
very
likely
that
what
the
lad
says
is
if
it
is
a
family
conversation
said
the
abbe
i
had
better
leave
oh
for
heaven
sake
no
i
could
not
stand
the
boy
alone
now
mister
ah
have
the
goodness
to
tell
your
billings
was
woefully
disconcerted
for
his
mother
and
he
had
agreed
that
as
soon
as
his
father
saw
him
he
would
be
recognised
at
once
and
mayhap
made
heir
to
the
estates
and
title
in
which
being
disappointed
he
very
sulkily
went
on
with
his
narrative
and
detailed
many
of
those
events
with
which
the
reader
has
already
been
made
acquainted
the
count
asked
the
boy
mother
christian
name
and
being
told
it
his
memory
at
once
returned
to
him
what
are
you
little
cat
son
said
his
excellency
by
heavens
mon
cher
abbe
a
charming
creature
but
a
tigress
positively
a
tigress
i
recollect
the
whole
affair
now
she
a
little
fresh
woman
she
with
a
sharp
nose
and
thick
eyebrows
ay
ah
yes
yes
went
on
my
lord
i
recollect
her
i
recollect
her
it
was
at
birmingham
i
first
met
her
she
was
my
lady
trippet
woman
was
she
she
was
no
such
thing
said
billings
hotly
her
aunt
kept
the
inn
on
waltham
green
and
your
lordship
seduced
seduced
her
oh
so
i
did
stap
me
now
i
did
yes
i
made
her
jump
on
my
black
horse
and
bore
her
off
like
like
aeneas
bore
his
wife
away
from
the
siege
of
rome
hey
the
events
were
precisely
similar
said
the
abbe
it
is
wonderful
what
a
memory
you
have
i
was
always
remarkable
for
it
continued
his
excellency
well
where
was
i
at
the
black
horse
yes
at
the
black
horse
well
i
mounted
her
on
the
black
horse
and
rode
her
en
croupe
egad
ha
ha
to
birmingham
and
there
we
billed
and
cooed
together
like
a
pair
of
yes
ha
that
we
did
and
this
i
suppose
is
the
end
of
some
of
the
billings
said
the
abbe
pointing
to
tom
billings
what
do
you
mean
yes
oh
ah
a
pun
a
calembourg
fi
donc
and
then
after
the
wont
of
very
stupid
people
de
galgenstein
went
on
to
explain
to
the
abbe
his
own
pun
well
but
to
proceed
cries
he
we
lived
together
at
birmingham
and
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
rich
heiress
egad
when
what
do
you
think
this
little
cat
does
she
murders
me
egad
and
makes
me
manquer
the
marriage
twenty
thousand
i
think
it
was
and
i
wanted
the
money
in
those
days
now
was
she
an
abominable
monster
that
mother
of
yours
hey
a
she
served
you
right
said
billings
with
a
great
oath
starting
up
out
of
all
patience
fellow
said
his
excellency
quite
aghast
do
you
know
to
whom
you
speak
to
a
nobleman
of
descents
a
count
of
the
holy
roman
empire
a
representative
of
a
sovereign
ha
egad
do
stamp
fellow
if
you
hope
for
my
d
n
your
protection
said
billings
in
a
fury
curse
you
and
your
protection
too
i
a
briton
and
no
french
papist
and
any
man
who
insults
my
mother
ay
or
calls
me
feller
had
better
look
to
himself
and
the
two
eyes
in
his
head
i
can
tell
him
and
with
this
billings
put
himself
into
the
most
approved
attitude
of
the
cockpit
and
invited
his
father
the
reverend
gentleman
and
monsieur
la
rose
the
valet
to
engage
with
him
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
the
two
latter
the
abbe
especially
seemed
dreadfully
frightened
but
the
count
now
looked
on
with
much
interest
and
giving
utterance
to
a
feeble
kind
of
chuckle
which
lasted
for
about
half
a
minute
said
paws
off
pompey
you
young
hangdog
you
egad
yes
aha
honour
you
a
lad
of
spirit
some
of
your
father
spunk
in
you
hey
i
know
him
by
that
oath
why
sir
when
i
was
sixteen
i
used
to
swear
to
swear
egad
like
a
thames
waterman
and
exactly
in
this
fellow
way
buss
me
my
lad
no
kiss
my
hand
that
will
do
and
he
held
out
a
very
lean
yellow
hand
peering
from
a
pair
of
yellow
ruffles
it
shook
very
much
and
the
shaking
made
all
the
rings
upon
it
shine
only
the
more
well
says
billings
if
you
was
to
abuse
me
nor
mother
i
do
care
if
i
shake
hands
with
you
i
ai
proud
the
abbe
laughed
with
great
glee
and
that
very
evening
sent
off
to
his
court
a
most
ludicrous
spicy
description
of
the
whole
scene
of
meeting
between
this
amiable
father
and
child
in
which
he
said
that
young
billings
was
the
eleve
favori
of
kitch
ecuyer
le
bourreau
de
londres
and
which
made
the
duke
mistress
laugh
so
much
that
she
vowed
that
the
abbe
should
have
a
bishopric
on
his
return
for
with
such
store
of
wisdom
look
you
my
son
was
the
world
governed
in
those
days
the
count
and
his
offspring
meanwhile
conversed
with
some
cordiality
the
former
informed
the
latter
of
all
the
diseases
to
which
he
was
subject
his
manner
of
curing
them
his
great
consideration
as
chamberlain
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
how
he
wore
his
court
suits
and
of
a
particular
powder
which
he
had
invented
for
the
hair
how
when
he
was
seventeen
he
had
run
away
with
a
canoness
egad
who
was
afterwards
locked
up
in
a
convent
and
grew
to
be
sixteen
stone
in
weight
how
he
remembered
the
time
when
ladies
did
not
wear
patches
and
how
the
duchess
of
marlborough
boxed
his
ears
when
he
was
so
high
because
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
all
these
important
anecdotes
took
some
time
in
the
telling
and
were
accompanied
by
many
profound
moral
remarks
such
as
i
ca
abide
garlic
nor
stap
me
nor
sauerkraut
though
his
highness
eats
half
a
bushel
per
day
i
ate
it
the
first
time
at
court
but
when
they
brought
it
me
a
second
time
i
refused
refused
split
me
and
grill
me
if
i
did
everybody
stared
his
highness
looked
as
fierce
as
a
turk
and
that
infernal
krahwinkel
my
dear
i
did
for
him
afterwards
that
cursed
krahwinkel
i
say
looked
as
pleased
as
possible
and
whispered
to
countess
fritsch
frau
grafinn
says
he
all
over
with
galgenstein
what
did
i
do
i
had
the
entree
and
demanded
it
says
i
falling
on
one
knee
ate
no
kraut
at
dinner
you
remarked
it
i
saw
your
highness
remark
it
did
le
comte
said
his
highness
gravely
i
had
almost
tears
in
my
eyes
but
it
was
necessary
to
come
to
a
resolution
you
know
said
i
speak
with
deep
grief
to
your
highness
who
are
my
benefactor
my
friend
my
father
but
of
this
i
am
resolved
i
will
never
eat
sauerkraut
more
it
do
agree
with
me
after
being
laid
up
for
four
weeks
by
the
last
dish
of
sauerkraut
of
which
i
partook
i
may
say
with
confidence
it
do
agree
with
me
by
impairing
my
health
it
impairs
my
intellect
and
weakens
my
strength
and
both
i
would
keep
for
your
highness
service
tut
said
his
highness
tut
tut
those
were
his
very
words
me
my
sword
or
my
pen
said
i
me
my
sword
or
my
pen
and
with
these
maximilian
de
galgenstein
is
ready
to
serve
you
but
sure
sure
a
great
prince
will
pity
the
weak
health
of
a
faithful
subject
who
does
not
know
how
to
eat
sauerkraut
his
highness
was
walking
about
the
room
i
was
still
on
my
knees
and
stretched
forward
my
hand
to
seize
his
coat
zum
teufel
sir
said
he
in
a
loud
voice
it
means
to
the
deuce
my
dear
zum
teufel
and
eat
what
you
like
with
this
he
went
out
of
the
room
abruptly
leaving
in
my
hand
one
of
his
buttons
which
i
keep
to
this
day
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
amazed
by
his
great
goodness
and
bounty
i
sobbed
aloud
cried
like
a
child
the
eyes
filled
and
winked
at
the
very
recollection
and
when
i
went
back
into
the
stepping
up
to
krahwinkel
says
i
looks
foolish
now
hey
there
la
rose
give
me
the
diamond
yes
that
was
the
very
pun
i
made
and
very
good
it
was
thought
says
i
looks
foolish
now
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
was
never
at
a
asked
to
eat
sauerkraut
never
hey
there
la
rose
bring
me
that
diamond
in
the
drawer
of
my
secretaire
and
the
was
brought
look
at
it
my
dear
said
the
count
for
i
saw
you
seemed
to
doubt
there
is
the
button
the
very
one
that
came
off
his
grace
billings
received
it
and
twisted
it
about
with
a
stupid
air
the
story
had
quite
mystified
him
for
he
did
not
dare
yet
to
think
his
father
was
a
fool
his
respect
for
the
aristocracy
prevented
him
when
the
count
communications
had
ceased
which
they
did
as
soon
as
the
story
of
the
sauerkraut
was
finished
a
silence
of
some
minutes
ensued
billings
was
trying
to
comprehend
the
circumstances
above
narrated
his
lordship
was
exhausted
the
chaplain
had
quitted
the
room
directly
the
word
sauerkraut
was
mentioned
he
knew
what
was
coming
his
lordship
looked
for
some
time
at
his
son
who
returned
the
gaze
with
his
mouth
wide
open
well
said
the
count
well
sir
what
are
you
sitting
there
for
if
you
have
nothing
to
say
sir
you
had
better
go
i
had
you
here
to
amuse
me
split
me
and
not
to
sit
there
staring
billings
rose
in
a
fury
hark
ye
my
lad
said
the
count
tell
la
rose
to
give
thee
five
guineas
and
ah
come
again
some
morning
a
nice
young
lad
mused
the
count
as
master
tommy
walked
wondering
out
of
the
apartment
a
pretty
fellow
enough
and
intelligent
well
he
is
an
odd
fellow
my
father
thought
billings
as
he
walked
out
having
received
the
sum
offered
to
him
and
he
immediately
went
to
call
upon
his
friend
polly
briggs
from
whom
he
had
separated
in
the
morning
what
was
the
result
of
their
interview
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
progress
of
this
history
having
made
her
however
acquainted
with
the
particulars
of
his
visit
to
his
father
he
went
to
his
mother
and
related
to
her
all
that
had
occurred
poor
thing
she
was
very
differently
interested
in
the
issue
of
it
chapter
x
showing
how
galgenstein
and
cat
recognise
each
other
in
marylebone
gardens
and
how
the
count
drives
her
home
in
his
carriage
about
a
month
after
the
touching
conversation
above
related
there
was
given
at
marylebone
gardens
a
grand
concert
and
entertainment
at
which
the
celebrated
madame
amenaide
a
dancer
of
the
theatre
at
paris
was
to
perform
under
the
patronage
of
several
english
and
foreign
noblemen
among
whom
was
his
excellency
the
bavarian
envoy
madame
amenaide
was
in
fact
no
other
than
the
maitresse
en
titre
of
the
monsieur
de
galgenstein
who
had
her
a
great
bargain
from
the
duke
de
at
paris
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
make
a
great
and
learned
display
here
otherwise
the
costumes
of
the
company
assembled
at
this
fete
might
afford
scope
for
at
least
pages
of
fine
writing
and
we
might
give
if
need
were
specimens
of
the
very
songs
and
music
sung
on
the
occasion
does
not
the
burney
collection
of
music
at
the
british
museum
afford
one
an
ample
store
of
songs
from
which
to
choose
are
there
not
the
memoirs
of
colley
cibber
those
of
clark
the
daughter
of
colley
is
there
not
congreve
and
farquhar
nay
and
at
a
pinch
the
dramatic
biography
or
even
the
spectator
from
which
the
observant
genius
might
borrow
passages
and
construct
pretty
antiquarian
figments
leave
we
these
trifles
to
meaner
souls
our
business
is
not
with
the
breeches
and
periwigs
with
the
hoops
and
patches
but
with
the
divine
hearts
of
men
and
the
passions
which
agitate
them
what
need
therefore
have
we
to
say
that
on
this
evening
after
the
dancing
the
music
and
the
fireworks
monsieur
de
galgenstein
felt
the
strange
and
welcome
pangs
of
appetite
and
was
picking
a
cold
chicken
along
with
some
other
friends
in
an
arbour
a
cold
chicken
with
an
accompaniment
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
when
he
was
led
to
remark
that
a
very
handsome
plump
little
person
in
a
gorgeous
stiff
damask
gown
and
petticoat
was
sauntering
up
and
down
the
walk
running
opposite
his
and
bestowing
continual
glances
towards
his
excellency
the
lady
whoever
she
was
was
in
a
mask
such
as
ladies
of
high
and
low
fashion
wore
at
public
places
in
those
days
and
had
a
male
companion
he
was
a
lad
of
only
seventeen
marvellously
well
dressed
indeed
no
other
than
the
count
own
son
thomas
billings
who
had
at
length
received
from
his
mother
the
sword
and
the
wig
which
that
affectionate
parent
had
promised
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
month
which
had
elapsed
since
the
interview
that
has
been
described
in
the
former
chapter
billings
had
several
times
had
occasion
to
wait
on
his
father
but
though
he
had
according
to
her
wishes
frequently
alluded
to
the
existence
of
his
mother
the
count
had
never
at
any
time
expressed
the
slightest
wish
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
that
lady
who
if
she
had
seen
him
had
only
seen
him
by
stealth
the
fact
is
that
after
billings
had
related
to
her
the
particulars
of
his
first
meeting
with
his
excellency
which
ended
like
many
of
the
latter
visits
in
nothing
at
all
hayes
had
found
some
pressing
business
which
continually
took
her
to
whitehall
and
had
been
prowling
from
day
to
day
about
monsieur
de
galgenstein
lodgings
four
or
five
times
in
the
week
as
his
excellency
stepped
into
his
coach
he
might
have
remarked
had
he
chosen
a
woman
in
a
black
hood
who
was
looking
most
eagerly
into
his
eyes
but
those
eyes
had
long
since
left
off
the
practice
of
observing
and
madam
catherine
visits
had
so
far
gone
for
nothing
on
this
night
however
inspired
by
gaiety
and
drink
the
count
had
been
amazingly
stricken
by
the
gait
and
ogling
of
the
lady
in
the
mask
the
reverend
who
was
with
him
and
had
observed
the
figure
in
the
black
cloak
recognised
or
thought
he
recognised
her
it
is
the
woman
who
dogs
your
excellency
every
day
said
he
she
is
with
that
tailor
lad
who
loves
to
see
people
hanged
your
excellency
son
i
and
he
was
just
about
to
warn
the
count
of
a
conspiracy
evidently
made
against
him
and
that
the
son
had
brought
most
likely
the
mother
to
play
her
arts
upon
him
he
was
just
about
i
say
to
show
to
the
count
the
folly
and
danger
of
renewing
an
old
liaison
with
a
woman
such
as
he
had
described
cat
to
be
when
his
excellency
starting
up
and
interrupting
his
ghostly
adviser
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
sentence
said
egad
you
are
right
it
is
my
son
and
a
mighty
creature
with
him
hey
tom
you
rogue
do
you
know
your
own
father
and
so
saying
and
cocking
his
beaver
on
one
side
monsieur
de
galgenstein
strutted
jauntily
after
billings
and
the
lady
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
count
had
formally
recognised
his
son
tom
you
rogue
stopped
at
this
and
the
count
came
up
he
had
a
white
velvet
suit
covered
over
with
stars
and
orders
a
neat
modest
wig
and
bag
and
with
silver
clasps
the
lady
in
the
mask
gave
a
start
as
his
excellency
came
forward
law
mother
do
squeege
so
said
tom
the
poor
woman
was
trembling
in
every
limb
but
she
had
presence
of
mind
to
squeege
tom
a
great
deal
harder
and
the
latter
took
the
hint
i
suppose
and
was
silent
the
splendid
count
came
up
ye
gods
how
his
embroidery
glittered
in
the
lamps
what
a
royal
exhalation
of
musk
and
bergamot
came
from
his
wig
his
handkerchief
and
his
grand
lace
ruffles
and
frills
a
broad
yellow
riband
passed
across
his
breast
and
ended
at
his
hip
in
a
shining
diamond
cross
a
diamond
cross
and
a
diamond
was
anything
ever
seen
so
beautiful
and
might
not
a
poor
woman
tremble
when
such
a
noble
creature
drew
near
to
her
and
deigned
from
the
height
of
his
rank
and
splendour
to
look
down
upon
her
as
jove
came
down
to
semele
in
state
in
his
habits
of
ceremony
with
all
the
grand
cordons
of
his
orders
blazing
about
his
imperial
person
thus
dazzling
magnificent
triumphant
the
great
galgenstein
descended
towards
catherine
her
cheeks
glowed
under
her
coy
velvet
mask
her
heart
thumped
against
the
whalebone
prison
of
her
stays
what
a
delicious
storm
of
vanity
was
raging
in
her
bosom
what
a
rush
of
recollections
burst
forth
at
the
sound
of
that
enchanting
voice
as
you
wind
up
a
chronometer
with
a
twopenny
as
by
means
of
a
dirty
wooden
plug
you
set
all
the
waters
of
versailles
and
splashing
and
storming
in
like
manner
and
by
like
humble
agents
were
catherine
tumultuous
passions
set
going
the
count
we
have
said
slipped
up
to
his
son
and
merely
saying
how
do
tom
cut
the
young
gentleman
altogether
and
passing
round
to
the
lady
side
said
madam
is
a
charming
evening
egad
it
is
she
almost
fainted
it
was
the
old
voice
there
he
was
after
seventeen
years
once
more
at
her
side
now
i
know
what
i
could
have
done
i
can
turn
out
a
quotation
from
sophocles
by
looking
to
the
index
as
well
as
another
i
can
throw
off
a
bit
of
fine
writing
too
with
passion
similes
and
a
moral
at
the
end
what
pray
is
the
last
sentence
but
one
but
the
very
finest
writing
suppose
for
example
i
had
made
maximilian
as
he
stood
by
the
side
of
catherine
look
up
towards
the
clouds
and
exclaim
in
the
words
of
the
voluptuous
cornelius
nepos
nephelai
phanerai
droseran
phusin
euageetoi
anglicised
version
of
the
author
original
greek
text
or
suppose
again
i
had
said
in
a
style
still
more
popular
the
count
advanced
towards
the
maiden
they
both
were
mute
for
a
while
and
only
the
beating
of
her
heart
interrupted
that
thrilling
and
passionate
silence
ah
what
years
of
buried
joys
and
fears
hopes
and
disappointments
arose
from
their
graves
in
the
far
past
and
in
those
brief
moments
flitted
before
the
united
ones
how
sad
was
that
delicious
retrospect
and
oh
how
sweet
the
tears
that
rolled
down
the
cheek
of
each
were
bubbles
from
the
choked
and
wells
of
youth
the
sigh
that
heaved
each
bosom
had
some
lurking
odours
in
it
memories
of
the
fragrance
of
boyhood
echoes
of
the
hymns
of
the
young
heart
thus
is
it
ever
for
these
blessed
recollections
the
soul
always
has
a
place
and
while
crime
perishes
and
sorrow
is
forgotten
the
beautiful
alone
is
eternal
o
golden
legends
written
in
the
skies
mused
de
galgenstein
ye
shine
as
ye
did
in
the
olden
days
we
change
but
ye
speak
ever
the
same
language
gazing
in
your
abysmal
depths
the
feeble
ratioci
there
now
are
six
columns
of
the
best
writing
to
be
found
in
this
or
any
other
book
galgenstein
has
quoted
euripides
thrice
plato
once
lycophron
nine
times
besides
extracts
from
the
latin
syntax
and
the
minor
greek
poets
catherine
passionate
embreathings
are
of
the
most
fashionable
order
and
i
call
upon
the
ingenious
critic
of
the
x
newspaper
to
say
whether
they
do
not
possess
the
real
impress
of
the
giants
of
the
olden
time
the
real
platonic
smack
in
a
word
not
that
i
want
in
the
least
to
show
off
but
it
is
as
well
every
now
and
then
to
show
the
public
what
one
can
do
there
were
six
columns
as
mentioned
by
the
accurate
solomons
but
we
have
withdrawn
two
pages
and
quarters
because
although
our
correspondent
has
been
excessively
eloquent
according
to
custom
we
were
anxious
to
come
to
the
facts
of
the
story
solomons
by
sending
to
our
office
may
have
the
cancelled
instead
however
of
all
this
rant
and
nonsense
how
much
finer
is
the
speech
that
the
count
really
did
make
it
is
a
very
fine
evening
egad
it
is
the
egad
did
the
whole
business
cat
was
as
much
in
love
with
him
now
as
ever
she
had
been
and
gathering
up
all
her
energies
she
said
it
is
dreadful
hot
too
i
think
and
with
this
she
made
a
curtsey
stifling
split
me
added
his
excellency
what
do
you
say
madam
to
a
rest
in
an
arbour
and
a
drink
of
something
cool
sir
said
the
lady
drawing
back
oh
a
drink
a
drink
by
all
means
exclaimed
billings
who
was
troubled
with
a
perpetual
thirst
come
mo
jones
i
mean
you
fond
of
a
glass
of
cold
punch
you
know
and
the
rum
here
is
prime
i
can
tell
the
lady
in
the
mask
consented
with
some
difficulty
to
the
proposal
of
billings
and
was
led
by
the
two
gentlemen
into
an
arbour
where
she
was
seated
between
them
and
some
being
lighted
punch
was
brought
she
drank
one
or
two
glasses
very
eagerly
and
so
did
her
two
companions
although
it
was
evident
to
see
from
the
flushed
looks
of
both
of
them
that
they
had
little
need
of
any
such
stimulus
the
count
in
the
midst
of
his
champagne
it
must
be
said
had
been
amazingly
stricken
and
scandalised
by
the
appearance
of
such
a
youth
as
billings
in
a
public
place
with
a
lady
under
his
arm
he
was
the
reader
will
therefore
understand
in
the
moral
stage
of
liquor
and
when
he
issued
out
it
was
not
merely
with
the
intention
of
examining
female
companion
but
of
administering
to
him
some
sound
correction
for
venturing
at
his
early
period
of
life
to
form
any
such
acquaintances
on
joining
billings
his
excellency
first
step
was
naturally
to
examine
the
lady
after
they
had
been
sitting
for
a
while
over
their
punch
he
bethought
him
of
his
original
purpose
and
began
to
address
a
number
of
moral
remarks
to
his
son
we
have
already
given
some
specimens
of
monsieur
de
galgenstein
sober
conversation
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
trouble
the
reader
with
any
further
reports
of
his
speeches
they
were
intolerably
stupid
and
dull
as
egotistical
as
his
morning
lecture
had
been
and
a
hundred
times
more
rambling
and
prosy
if
cat
had
been
in
the
possession
of
her
sober
senses
she
would
have
seen
in
five
minutes
that
her
ancient
lover
was
a
ninny
and
have
left
him
with
scorn
but
she
was
under
the
charm
of
old
recollections
and
the
sound
of
that
silly
voice
was
to
her
magical
as
for
billings
he
allowed
his
excellency
to
continue
his
prattle
only
frowning
yawning
cursing
occasionally
but
drinking
continually
so
the
count
descanted
at
length
upon
the
enormity
of
young
early
liaisons
and
then
he
told
his
own
in
the
year
four
with
a
burgomaster
daughter
at
ratisbon
when
he
was
in
the
elector
of
bavaria
service
then
after
blenheim
when
he
had
come
over
to
the
duke
of
marlborough
when
a
physician
wife
at
bonn
poisoned
herself
for
him
etc
etc
of
a
piece
with
the
story
of
the
canoness
which
has
been
recorded
before
all
the
tales
were
true
a
clever
ugly
man
every
now
and
then
is
successful
with
the
ladies
but
a
handsome
fool
is
irresistible
cat
listened
and
listened
good
heavens
she
had
heard
all
these
tales
before
and
recollected
the
place
and
the
time
how
she
was
hemming
a
handkerchief
for
max
who
came
round
and
kissed
her
vowing
that
the
physician
wife
was
nothing
compared
to
her
how
he
was
tired
and
lying
on
the
sofa
just
come
home
from
shooting
how
handsome
he
looked
cat
thought
he
was
only
the
handsomer
now
and
looked
more
grave
and
thoughtful
the
dear
fellow
the
garden
was
filled
with
a
vast
deal
of
company
of
all
kinds
and
parties
were
passing
every
moment
before
the
arbour
where
our
trio
sat
about
after
his
excellency
had
quitted
his
own
box
and
party
the
rev
came
discreetly
round
to
examine
the
proceedings
of
his
diplomatical
chef
the
lady
in
the
mask
was
listening
with
all
her
might
billings
was
drawing
figures
on
the
table
with
punch
and
the
count
talking
incessantly
the
father
confessor
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
with
something
resembling
an
oath
walked
away
to
the
entry
of
the
gardens
where
his
excellency
gilt
coach
with
three
footmen
was
waiting
to
carry
him
back
to
london
get
me
a
chair
joseph
said
his
reverence
who
infinitely
preferred
a
seat
gratis
in
the
coach
that
fool
muttered
he
will
not
move
for
this
the
reverend
gentleman
knew
that
when
the
count
was
on
the
subject
of
the
physician
wife
his
discourses
were
intolerably
long
and
took
upon
himself
therefore
to
disappear
along
with
the
rest
of
the
party
who
procured
other
conveyances
and
returned
to
their
homes
after
this
quiet
shadow
had
passed
before
the
count
box
many
groups
of
persons
passed
and
repassed
and
among
them
was
no
other
than
polly
briggs
to
whom
we
have
been
already
introduced
polly
was
in
company
with
one
or
two
other
ladies
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
with
large
shoulders
and
calves
a
fierce
cock
to
his
hat
and
a
shabby
genteel
air
his
name
was
moffat
and
his
present
occupation
was
that
of
doorkeeper
at
a
in
covent
garden
where
though
he
saw
many
thousands
pass
daily
under
his
eyes
his
own
salary
amounted
to
no
more
than
weekly
a
sum
quite
insufficient
to
maintain
him
in
the
rank
which
he
held
moffat
had
however
received
some
funds
amounting
indeed
to
a
matter
of
twelve
guineas
within
the
last
month
and
was
treating
briggs
very
generously
to
the
concert
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
that
every
one
of
the
twelve
guineas
had
come
out
of
polly
own
pocket
who
in
return
had
received
them
from
billings
and
as
the
reader
may
remember
that
on
the
day
of
tommy
first
interview
with
his
father
he
had
previously
paid
a
visit
to
briggs
having
under
his
arm
a
pair
of
breeches
which
briggs
coveted
he
should
now
be
informed
that
she
desired
these
breeches
not
for
pincushions
but
for
moffat
who
had
long
been
in
want
of
a
pair
having
thus
episodically
narrated
moffat
history
let
us
state
that
he
his
lady
and
their
friends
passed
before
the
count
arbour
joining
in
a
melodious
chorus
to
a
song
which
one
of
the
society
an
actor
of
betterton
was
singing
is
my
will
when
i
dead
that
no
tear
shall
be
shed
no
jacet
be
graved
on
my
stone
but
pour
my
ashes
a
bottle
of
red
and
say
a
good
fellow
is
gone
my
brave
boys
and
say
a
good
fellow
is
my
brave
boys
was
given
with
vast
emphasis
by
the
party
moffat
growling
it
in
a
rich
bass
and
briggs
in
a
soaring
treble
as
to
the
notes
when
quavering
up
to
the
skies
they
excited
various
emotions
among
the
people
in
the
gardens
silence
them
blackguards
shouted
a
barber
who
was
taking
a
pint
of
small
beer
along
with
his
lady
stop
that
there
infernal
screeching
said
a
couple
of
ladies
who
were
sipping
ratafia
in
company
with
two
pretty
fellows
dang
it
it
polly
said
tom
billings
bolting
out
of
the
box
and
rushing
towards
the
briggs
when
he
reached
her
which
he
did
quickly
and
made
his
arrival
known
by
tipping
briggs
slightly
on
the
waist
and
suddenly
bouncing
down
before
her
and
her
friend
both
of
the
latter
drew
back
somewhat
startled
law
billings
says
polly
rather
coolly
is
it
you
who
thought
of
seeing
you
here
who
this
here
young
feller
says
towering
moffat
with
his
bass
voice
it
billings
cousin
a
friend
of
mine
said
polly
beseechingly
oh
cousin
if
it
a
friend
of
yours
he
should
know
better
how
to
conduct
himself
that
all
har
you
a
young
feller
that
you
cut
them
there
capers
before
gentlemen
growled
moffat
who
hated
billings
for
the
excellent
reason
that
he
lived
upon
him
be
hanged
said
billings
with
becoming
spirit
if
you
call
me
i
pull
your
what
roared
moffat
pull
my
nose
my
nose
i
tell
you
what
my
lad
if
you
durst
move
me
i
cut
your
throat
curse
me
oh
moffy
cousin
i
mean
is
a
shame
to
treat
the
poor
boy
so
go
away
tommy
do
go
away
my
cousin
in
liquor
whimpered
madam
briggs
who
really
thought
that
the
great
doorkeeper
would
put
his
threat
into
execution
tommy
said
moffat
frowning
horribly
tommy
to
me
too
dog
get
out
of
my
ssss
sight
was
the
word
which
moffat
intended
to
utter
but
he
was
interrupted
for
to
the
astonishment
of
his
friends
and
himself
billings
did
actually
make
a
spring
at
the
nose
and
caught
it
so
firmly
that
the
latter
could
not
finish
his
sentence
the
operation
was
performed
with
amazing
celerity
and
having
concluded
it
billings
sprang
back
and
whisked
from
out
its
sheath
that
new
sword
which
his
mamma
had
given
him
now
said
he
with
a
fierce
kind
of
calmness
now
for
the
cousin
i
your
man
how
the
brawl
might
have
ended
no
one
can
say
had
the
two
gentlemen
actually
crossed
swords
but
polly
with
a
wonderful
presence
of
mind
restored
peace
by
exclaiming
hush
hush
the
beaks
the
beaks
upon
which
with
one
common
instinct
the
whole
party
made
a
rush
for
the
garden
gates
and
disappeared
into
the
fields
briggs
knew
her
company
there
was
something
in
the
very
name
of
a
constable
which
sent
them
all
after
running
a
reasonable
time
billings
stopped
but
the
great
moffat
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
polly
briggs
had
likewise
vanished
then
tom
bethought
him
that
he
would
go
back
to
his
mother
but
arriving
at
the
gate
of
the
gardens
was
refused
admittance
as
he
had
not
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
i
left
says
tommy
giving
himself
the
airs
of
a
gentleman
some
friends
in
the
gardens
i
with
his
excellency
the
bavarian
then
you
had
better
go
away
with
him
said
the
gate
people
but
i
tell
you
i
left
him
there
in
the
grand
circle
with
a
lady
and
what
more
in
the
dark
walk
i
have
left
a
oh
my
lord
i
go
and
tell
him
then
cried
one
of
the
porters
if
you
will
billings
seated
himself
on
a
post
near
the
gate
and
there
consented
to
remain
until
the
return
of
his
messenger
the
latter
went
straight
to
the
dark
walk
and
found
the
sword
sure
enough
but
instead
of
returning
it
to
its
owner
this
discourteous
knight
broke
the
trenchant
blade
at
the
hilt
and
flinging
the
steel
away
pocketed
the
baser
silver
metal
and
lurked
off
by
the
private
door
consecrated
to
the
waiters
and
fiddlers
in
the
meantime
billings
waited
and
waited
and
what
was
the
conversation
of
his
worthy
parents
inside
the
garden
i
can
not
say
but
one
of
the
waiters
declared
that
he
had
served
the
great
foreign
count
with
two
bowls
of
and
some
biscuits
in
no
that
in
the
box
with
him
were
first
a
young
gentleman
who
went
away
and
a
lady
splendidly
dressed
and
masked
that
when
the
lady
and
his
lordship
were
alone
she
edged
away
to
the
further
end
of
the
table
and
they
had
much
talk
that
at
last
when
his
grace
had
pressed
her
very
much
she
took
off
her
mask
and
said
do
you
know
me
now
max
that
he
cried
out
my
own
catherine
thou
art
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
wanted
to
kneel
down
and
vow
eternal
love
to
her
but
she
begged
him
not
to
do
so
in
a
place
where
all
the
world
would
see
that
then
his
highness
paid
and
they
left
the
gardens
the
lady
putting
on
her
mask
again
when
they
issued
from
the
gardens
ho
joseph
la
rose
my
coach
shouted
his
excellency
in
rather
a
husky
voice
and
the
men
who
had
been
waiting
came
up
with
the
carriage
a
young
gentleman
who
was
dosing
on
one
of
the
posts
at
the
entry
woke
up
suddenly
at
the
blaze
of
the
torches
and
the
noise
of
the
footmen
the
count
gave
his
arm
to
the
lady
in
the
mask
who
slipped
in
and
he
was
whispering
la
rose
when
the
lad
who
had
been
sleeping
hit
his
excellency
on
the
shoulder
and
said
i
say
count
you
can
give
me
a
cast
home
too
and
jumped
into
the
coach
when
catherine
saw
her
son
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
kissed
him
with
a
burst
of
hysterical
tears
of
which
billings
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
meaning
the
count
joined
them
looking
not
a
little
disconcerted
and
the
pair
were
landed
at
their
own
door
where
stood
hayes
in
his
nightcap
ready
to
receive
them
and
astounded
at
the
splendour
of
the
equipage
in
which
his
wife
returned
to
him
chapter
xi
of
some
domestic
quarrels
and
the
consequence
thereof
an
ingenious
who
lived
in
the
time
of
brock
and
the
duke
of
marlborough
compared
the
latter
gentleman
conduct
in
battle
when
he
in
peaceful
thought
the
field
of
death
surveyed
to
fainting
squadrons
lent
the
timely
aid
inspired
repulsed
battalions
to
engage
and
taught
the
doubtful
battle
where
to
rage
joseph
addison
i
say
compared
the
duke
of
marlborough
to
an
angel
who
is
sent
by
divine
command
to
chastise
a
guilty
people
and
pleased
his
master
orders
to
perform
rides
on
the
whirlwind
and
directs
the
the
first
four
of
these
novel
lines
touch
off
the
duke
disposition
and
genius
to
a
tittle
he
had
a
love
for
such
scenes
of
strife
in
the
midst
of
them
his
spirit
rose
calm
and
supreme
soaring
like
an
angel
or
not
but
anyway
the
compliment
is
a
very
pretty
one
on
the
majestic
and
causing
to
ebb
or
to
flow
the
mighty
tide
of
war
but
as
this
famous
simile
might
apply
with
equal
propriety
to
a
bad
angel
as
to
a
good
one
it
may
in
like
manner
be
employed
to
illustrate
small
quarrels
as
well
as
great
a
little
family
squabble
in
which
two
or
three
people
are
engaged
as
well
as
a
vast
national
dispute
argued
on
each
side
by
the
roaring
throats
of
five
hundred
angry
cannon
the
poet
means
in
fact
that
the
duke
of
marlborough
had
an
immense
genius
for
mischief
our
friend
brock
or
wood
whose
actions
we
love
to
illustrate
by
the
very
handsomest
similes
possessed
this
genius
in
common
with
his
grace
and
was
never
so
happy
or
seen
to
so
much
advantage
as
when
he
was
employed
in
setting
people
by
the
ears
his
spirits
usually
dull
then
rose
into
the
utmost
gaiety
and
when
the
doubtful
battle
flagged
he
by
his
art
would
instantly
restore
it
when
for
instance
tom
repulsed
battalions
of
rhetoric
fled
from
his
fire
a
few
words
of
apt
sneer
or
encouragement
on
wood
part
would
bring
the
fight
round
again
or
when
hayes
fainting
squadrons
of
abuse
broke
upon
the
stubborn
squares
of
tom
bristling
obstinacy
it
was
wood
delight
to
rally
the
former
and
bring
him
once
more
to
the
charge
a
great
share
had
this
man
in
making
those
bad
people
worse
many
fierce
words
and
bad
passions
many
falsehoods
and
knaveries
on
tom
part
much
bitterness
scorn
and
jealousy
on
the
part
of
hayes
and
catherine
might
be
attributed
to
this
hoary
old
tempter
whose
joy
and
occupation
it
was
to
raise
and
direct
the
domestic
storms
and
whirlwinds
of
the
family
of
which
he
was
a
member
and
do
not
let
us
be
accused
of
an
undue
propensity
to
use
sounding
words
because
we
compare
three
scoundrels
in
the
tyburn
road
to
so
many
armies
and
wood
to
a
mighty
my
dear
sir
when
you
have
well
studied
the
world
how
supremely
great
the
meanest
thing
in
this
world
is
and
how
infinitely
mean
the
greatest
i
am
mistaken
if
you
do
not
make
a
strange
and
proper
jumble
of
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
the
lofty
and
the
low
i
have
looked
at
the
world
for
my
part
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
know
not
which
is
which
well
then
on
the
night
when
mrs
hayes
as
recorded
by
us
had
been
to
the
marylebone
gardens
wood
had
found
the
sincerest
enjoyment
in
plying
her
husband
with
drink
so
that
when
catherine
arrived
at
home
hayes
came
forward
to
meet
her
in
a
manner
which
showed
he
was
not
only
surly
but
drunk
tom
stepped
out
of
the
coach
first
and
hayes
asked
him
with
an
oath
where
he
had
been
the
oath
billings
sternly
flung
back
again
with
another
in
its
company
and
at
the
same
time
refused
to
give
his
stepfather
any
sort
of
answer
to
his
query
the
old
man
is
drunk
mother
said
he
to
hayes
as
he
handed
that
lady
out
of
the
coach
before
leaving
which
she
had
to
withdraw
her
hand
rather
violently
from
the
grasp
of
the
count
who
was
inside
hayes
instantly
showed
the
correctness
of
his
surmise
by
slamming
the
door
courageously
in
tom
face
when
he
attempted
to
enter
the
house
with
his
mother
and
when
catherine
remonstrated
according
to
her
wont
in
a
very
angry
and
supercilious
tone
hayes
replied
with
equal
haughtiness
and
a
regular
quarrel
ensued
people
were
accustomed
in
those
days
to
use
much
more
simple
and
expressive
terms
of
language
than
are
now
thought
polite
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
give
in
this
present
year
the
exact
words
of
reproach
which
passed
between
hayes
and
his
wife
in
wood
sat
near
laughing
his
sides
out
hayes
swore
that
his
wife
should
not
go
abroad
to
in
search
of
vile
popish
noblemen
to
which
hayes
replied
that
hayes
was
a
pitiful
lying
sneaking
cur
and
that
she
would
go
where
she
pleased
hayes
rejoined
that
if
she
said
much
more
he
would
take
a
stick
to
her
wood
whispered
and
serve
her
hayes
thereupon
swore
she
had
stood
his
cowardly
blows
once
or
twice
before
but
that
if
ever
he
did
so
again
as
sure
as
she
was
born
she
would
stab
him
wood
said
curse
me
but
i
like
her
hayes
took
another
line
of
argument
and
said
the
neighbours
would
talk
ay
that
they
will
no
doubt
said
wood
then
let
them
said
catherine
what
do
we
care
about
the
neighbours
did
the
neighbours
talk
when
you
sent
widow
wilkins
to
gaol
the
neighbours
talk
when
you
levied
on
poor
old
thomson
you
did
mind
then
business
is
business
and
if
i
did
distrain
on
thomson
and
lock
up
wilkins
i
think
you
knew
about
it
as
much
as
i
believe
you
a
pair
said
wood
pray
sir
keep
your
tongue
to
yourself
your
opinion
is
asked
anyhow
no
nor
your
company
wanted
neither
cried
catherine
with
proper
spirit
at
which
remark
wood
only
whistled
i
have
asked
this
here
gentleman
to
pass
this
evening
along
with
me
we
been
drinking
together
that
we
have
said
wood
looking
at
cat
with
the
most
perfect
i
say
that
we
been
together
and
when
we
been
together
i
say
that
a
man
is
my
friend
doctor
wood
is
my
friend
madam
the
reverend
doctor
wood
we
passed
the
evening
in
company
talking
about
politics
madam
politics
and
we
not
been
flaunting
in
and
ogling
the
it
a
lie
shrieked
hayes
i
went
with
tom
you
know
i
did
the
boy
would
let
me
rest
till
i
promised
to
hang
him
i
hate
him
said
hayes
he
always
in
my
he
the
only
friend
i
have
in
the
world
and
the
only
being
i
care
a
pin
for
said
catherine
he
an
impudent
idle
scoundrel
and
i
hope
to
see
him
hanged
shouted
hayes
and
pray
madam
whose
carriage
was
that
as
you
came
home
in
i
warrant
you
paid
something
for
the
ride
ha
ha
another
lie
screamed
cat
and
clutched
hold
of
a
say
it
again
john
hayes
and
by
i
do
for
do
for
me
hang
me
said
hayes
flourishing
a
stick
and
perfectly
do
you
think
i
care
for
a
bastard
and
a
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
woman
ran
at
him
like
a
savage
knife
in
hand
he
bounded
back
flinging
his
arms
about
wildly
and
struck
her
with
his
staff
sharply
across
the
forehead
the
woman
went
down
instantly
a
lucky
blow
was
it
for
hayes
and
her
it
saved
him
from
death
perhaps
and
her
from
murder
all
this
scene
a
very
important
one
of
our
drama
might
have
been
described
at
much
greater
length
but
in
truth
the
author
has
a
natural
horror
of
dwelling
too
long
upon
such
hideous
spectacles
nor
would
the
reader
be
much
edified
by
a
full
and
accurate
knowledge
of
what
took
place
the
quarrel
however
though
not
more
violent
than
many
that
had
previously
taken
place
between
hayes
and
his
wife
was
about
to
cause
vast
changes
in
the
condition
of
this
unhappy
pair
hayes
was
at
the
first
moment
of
his
victory
very
much
alarmed
he
feared
that
he
had
killed
the
woman
and
wood
started
up
rather
anxiously
too
with
the
same
fancy
but
she
soon
began
to
recover
water
was
brought
her
head
was
raised
and
bound
up
and
in
a
short
time
catherine
gave
vent
to
a
copious
fit
of
tears
which
relieved
her
somewhat
these
did
not
affect
hayes
much
they
rather
pleased
him
for
he
saw
he
had
got
the
better
and
although
cat
fiercely
turned
upon
him
when
he
made
some
small
attempt
towards
reconciliation
he
did
not
heed
her
anger
but
smiled
and
winked
in
a
way
at
wood
the
coward
was
quite
proud
of
his
victory
and
finding
catherine
asleep
or
apparently
so
when
he
followed
her
to
bed
speedily
gave
himself
up
to
slumber
too
and
had
some
pleasant
dreams
to
his
portion
wood
also
went
sniggering
and
happy
upstairs
to
his
chamber
the
quarrel
had
been
a
real
treat
to
him
it
excited
the
old
man
tickled
him
into
and
he
promised
himself
a
rare
continuation
of
the
fun
when
tom
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
the
dispute
as
for
his
excellency
the
count
the
ride
from
marylebone
gardens
and
a
tender
squeeze
of
the
hand
which
catherine
permitted
to
him
on
parting
had
so
inflamed
the
passions
of
the
nobleman
that
after
sleeping
for
nine
hours
and
taking
his
chocolate
as
usual
the
next
morning
he
actually
delayed
to
read
the
newspaper
and
kept
waiting
a
lady
from
cornhill
with
the
sweetest
bargain
of
mechlin
lace
in
order
to
discourse
to
his
chaplain
on
the
charms
of
hayes
she
poor
thing
never
closed
her
lids
except
when
she
would
have
had
hayes
imagine
that
she
slumbered
but
lay
beside
him
tossing
and
tumbling
with
hot
eyes
wide
open
and
heart
thumping
and
pulse
of
a
hundred
and
ten
and
heard
the
heavy
hours
tolling
and
at
last
the
day
came
peering
haggard
through
the
and
found
her
still
wakeful
and
wretched
hayes
had
never
been
as
we
have
seen
especially
fond
of
her
lord
but
now
as
the
day
made
visible
to
her
the
sleeping
figure
and
countenance
of
that
gentleman
she
looked
at
him
with
a
contempt
and
loathing
such
as
she
had
never
felt
even
in
all
the
years
of
her
wedded
life
hayes
was
snoring
profoundly
by
his
bedside
on
his
ledger
stood
a
large
greasy
tin
candlestick
containing
a
lank
turned
down
in
the
shaft
and
in
the
lower
part
his
keys
purse
and
his
feet
were
huddled
up
in
his
greasy
threadbare
clothes
his
head
and
half
his
sallow
face
muffled
up
in
a
red
woollen
nightcap
his
beard
was
of
several
days
growth
his
mouth
was
wide
open
and
he
was
snoring
profoundly
on
a
more
despicable
little
creature
the
sun
never
shone
and
to
this
sordid
wretch
was
catherine
united
for
ever
what
a
pretty
rascal
history
might
be
read
in
yonder
greasy
which
never
left
the
miser
he
never
read
in
any
other
of
what
a
treasure
were
yonder
keys
and
purse
the
keepers
not
a
shilling
they
guarded
but
was
picked
from
the
pocket
of
necessity
plundered
from
needy
wantonness
or
pitilessly
squeezed
from
starvation
a
fool
a
miser
and
a
coward
why
was
i
bound
to
this
wretch
thought
catherine
i
who
am
and
beautiful
did
not
he
tell
me
so
i
who
born
a
beggar
have
raised
myself
to
competence
and
might
have
mounted
who
knows
whither
if
cursed
fortune
had
not
baulked
me
as
cat
did
not
utter
these
sentiments
but
only
thought
them
we
have
a
right
to
clothe
her
thoughts
in
the
genteelest
possible
language
and
to
the
best
of
our
power
have
done
so
if
the
reader
examines
hayes
train
of
reasoning
he
will
not
we
should
think
fail
to
perceive
how
ingeniously
she
managed
to
fix
all
the
wrong
upon
her
husband
and
yet
to
twist
out
some
consolatory
arguments
for
her
own
vanity
this
perverse
argumentation
we
have
all
of
us
no
doubt
employed
in
our
time
how
often
have
we
we
poets
politicians
philosophers
found
charming
excuses
for
our
own
rascalities
in
the
monstrous
wickedness
of
the
world
about
us
how
loudly
have
we
abused
the
times
and
our
neighbours
all
this
logic
did
catherine
lying
wakeful
in
her
bed
on
the
night
of
the
marylebone
fete
exert
in
gloomy
triumph
it
must
however
be
confessed
that
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
hayes
sense
of
her
husband
scoundrelism
and
meanness
for
if
we
have
not
proved
these
in
the
course
of
this
history
we
have
proved
nothing
cat
had
a
shrewd
observing
mind
and
if
she
wanted
for
proofs
against
hayes
she
had
but
to
look
before
and
about
her
to
find
them
this
amiable
pair
were
lying
in
a
large
with
faded
silk
furniture
which
had
been
taken
from
under
a
respectable
old
invalid
widow
who
had
become
security
for
a
prodigal
son
the
room
was
hung
round
with
an
antique
tapestry
representing
rebecca
at
the
well
bathsheba
bathing
judith
and
holofernes
and
other
subjects
from
holy
writ
which
had
been
many
score
times
sold
for
fifty
pounds
and
bought
back
by
hayes
for
two
in
those
accommodating
bargains
which
he
made
with
young
gentlemen
who
received
fifty
pounds
of
money
and
fifty
of
tapestry
in
consideration
of
their
bills
against
this
tapestry
and
just
cutting
off
holofernes
head
stood
an
enormous
ominous
black
clock
the
spoil
of
some
other
usurious
transaction
some
chairs
and
a
dismal
old
black
cabinet
completed
the
furniture
of
this
apartment
it
wanted
but
a
ghost
to
render
its
gloom
complete
hayes
sat
up
in
the
bed
sternly
regarding
her
husband
there
is
be
sure
a
strong
magnetic
influence
in
wakeful
eyes
so
examining
a
sleeping
person
do
not
you
as
a
boy
remember
waking
of
bright
summer
mornings
and
finding
your
mother
looking
over
you
had
not
the
gaze
of
her
tender
eyes
stolen
into
your
senses
long
before
you
woke
and
cast
over
your
slumbering
spirit
a
sweet
spell
of
peace
and
love
and
fresh
springing
joy
some
such
influence
had
catherine
looks
upon
her
husband
for
as
he
slept
under
them
the
man
began
to
writhe
about
uneasily
and
to
burrow
his
head
in
the
pillow
and
to
utter
quick
strange
moans
and
cries
such
as
have
often
jarred
one
ear
while
watching
at
the
bed
of
the
feverish
sleeper
it
was
just
upon
six
and
presently
the
clock
began
to
utter
those
dismal
grinding
sounds
which
issue
from
clocks
at
such
periods
and
which
sound
like
the
of
the
departing
hour
then
the
bell
struck
the
knell
of
it
and
with
this
hayes
awoke
and
looked
up
and
saw
catherine
gazing
at
him
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
and
catherine
turned
away
burning
red
and
looking
as
if
she
had
been
caught
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
a
kind
of
blank
terror
seized
upon
old
hayes
soul
a
horrible
icy
fear
and
presentiment
of
coming
evil
and
yet
the
woman
had
but
looked
at
him
he
thought
rapidly
over
the
occurrences
of
the
last
night
the
quarrel
and
the
end
of
it
he
had
often
struck
her
before
when
angry
and
heaped
all
kinds
of
bitter
words
upon
her
but
in
the
morning
she
bore
no
malice
and
the
previous
quarrel
was
forgotten
or
at
least
passed
over
why
should
the
last
night
dispute
not
have
the
same
end
hayes
calculated
all
this
and
tried
to
smile
i
hope
we
friends
cat
said
he
you
know
i
was
in
liquor
last
night
and
sadly
put
out
by
the
loss
of
that
fifty
pound
they
ruin
me
dear
i
know
they
hayes
did
not
answer
i
should
like
to
see
the
country
again
dear
said
he
in
his
most
wheedling
way
i
a
mind
do
you
know
to
call
in
all
our
money
you
who
made
every
farthing
of
it
that
sure
and
it
a
matter
of
two
thousand
pound
by
this
time
suppose
we
go
into
warwickshire
cat
and
buy
a
farm
and
live
genteel
should
you
like
to
live
a
lady
in
your
own
county
again
how
they
stare
at
birmingham
hey
cat
and
with
this
hayes
made
a
motion
as
if
he
would
seize
his
hand
but
she
flung
his
back
again
coward
said
she
you
want
liquor
to
give
you
courage
and
then
you
only
heart
enough
to
strike
it
was
only
in
my
dear
said
hayes
whose
courage
had
all
gone
you
tried
you
know
to
to
to
stab
you
and
i
wish
i
had
said
hayes
setting
her
teeth
and
glaring
at
him
like
a
demon
and
so
saying
she
sprung
out
of
bed
there
was
a
great
stain
of
blood
on
her
pillow
look
at
it
said
she
that
blood
of
your
shedding
and
at
this
hayes
fairly
began
to
weep
so
utterly
downcast
and
frightened
was
the
miserable
man
the
tears
only
inspired
his
wife
with
a
still
greater
rage
and
loathing
she
cared
not
so
much
for
the
blow
but
she
hated
the
man
the
man
to
whom
she
was
tied
for
ever
for
ever
the
bar
between
her
and
wealth
happiness
love
rank
perhaps
if
i
were
free
thought
hayes
the
thought
had
been
sitting
at
her
pillow
all
night
and
whispering
ceaselessly
into
her
ear
if
i
were
free
max
would
marry
me
i
know
he
would
he
said
so
yesterday
as
if
by
a
kind
of
intuition
old
wood
seemed
to
read
all
this
thoughts
for
he
said
that
day
with
a
sneer
that
he
would
wager
she
was
thinking
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
be
a
count
lady
than
a
poor
miser
wife
and
faith
said
he
a
count
and
a
is
better
than
an
old
skinflint
with
a
and
then
he
asked
her
if
her
head
was
better
and
supposed
that
she
was
used
to
beating
and
cut
sundry
other
jokes
which
made
the
poor
wretch
wounds
of
mind
and
body
feel
a
thousand
times
sorer
tom
too
was
made
acquainted
with
the
dispute
and
swore
his
accustomed
vengeance
against
his
stepfather
such
feelings
wood
with
a
dexterous
malice
would
never
let
rest
it
was
his
joy
at
first
quite
a
disinterested
one
to
goad
catherine
and
to
frighten
hayes
though
in
truth
that
unfortunate
creature
had
no
occasion
for
incitements
from
without
to
keep
up
the
dreadful
state
of
terror
and
depression
into
which
he
had
fallen
for
from
the
morning
after
the
quarrel
the
horrible
words
and
looks
of
catherine
never
left
hayes
memory
but
a
cold
fear
followed
him
a
dreadful
prescience
he
strove
to
overcome
this
fate
as
a
coward
would
to
kneel
to
it
for
compassion
to
coax
and
wheedle
it
into
forgiveness
he
was
slavishly
gentle
to
catherine
and
bore
her
fierce
taunts
with
mean
resignation
he
trembled
before
young
billings
who
was
now
established
in
the
house
his
mother
said
to
protect
her
against
the
violence
of
her
husband
and
suffered
his
brutal
language
and
conduct
without
venturing
to
resist
the
young
man
and
his
mother
lorded
over
the
house
hayes
hardly
dared
to
speak
in
their
presence
seldom
sat
with
the
family
except
at
meals
but
slipped
away
to
his
chamber
he
slept
apart
now
from
his
wife
or
passed
the
evening
at
the
where
he
was
constrained
to
drink
to
spend
some
of
his
beloved
sixpences
for
drink
and
of
course
the
neighbours
began
to
say
john
hayes
neglects
his
he
tyrannises
over
her
and
beats
always
at
the
leaving
an
honest
woman
alone
at
home
the
unfortunate
wretch
did
not
hate
his
wife
he
was
used
to
her
fond
of
her
as
much
as
he
could
be
fond
sighed
to
be
friends
with
her
again
repeatedly
would
creep
whimpering
to
wood
room
when
the
latter
was
alone
and
begged
him
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
they
were
reconciled
as
much
as
ever
they
could
be
the
woman
looked
at
him
thought
what
she
might
be
but
for
him
and
scorned
and
loathed
him
with
a
feeling
that
almost
amounted
to
insanity
what
nights
she
lay
awake
weeping
and
cursing
herself
and
him
his
humility
and
beseeching
looks
only
made
him
more
despicable
and
hateful
to
her
if
hayes
did
not
hate
the
mother
however
he
hated
the
boy
hated
and
feared
him
dreadfully
he
would
have
poisoned
him
if
he
had
had
the
courage
but
he
dared
not
he
dared
not
even
look
at
him
as
he
sat
there
the
master
of
the
house
in
insolent
triumph
o
god
how
the
lad
brutal
laughter
rung
in
hayes
ears
and
how
the
stare
of
his
fierce
bold
black
eyes
pursued
him
of
a
truth
if
wood
loved
mischief
as
he
did
honestly
and
purely
for
mischief
sake
he
had
enough
here
there
was
mean
malice
and
fierce
scorn
and
black
revenge
and
sinful
desire
boiling
up
in
the
hearts
of
these
wretched
people
enough
to
content
wood
great
master
himself
hayes
business
as
we
have
said
was
nominally
that
of
a
carpenter
but
since
for
the
last
few
years
he
had
added
to
it
that
of
a
lender
of
money
the
carpenter
trade
had
been
neglected
altogether
for
one
so
much
more
profitable
hayes
had
exerted
herself
with
much
benefit
to
her
husband
in
his
usurious
business
she
was
a
resolute
keen
woman
that
did
not
love
money
but
loved
to
be
rich
and
push
her
way
in
the
world
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
trade
now
however
and
told
her
husband
to
manage
it
himself
she
felt
that
she
was
separated
from
him
for
ever
and
could
no
more
be
brought
to
consider
her
interests
as
connected
with
his
own
the
man
was
well
fitted
for
the
creeping
and
niggling
of
his
dastardly
trade
and
gathered
his
moneys
and
busied
himself
with
his
lawyer
and
acted
as
his
own
bookkeeper
and
clerk
not
without
satisfaction
his
wife
speculations
when
they
worked
in
concert
used
often
to
frighten
him
he
never
sent
out
his
capital
without
a
pang
and
only
because
he
dared
not
question
her
superior
judgment
and
will
he
began
now
to
lend
no
more
he
could
not
let
the
money
out
of
his
sight
his
sole
pleasure
was
to
creep
up
into
his
room
and
count
and
recount
it
when
billings
came
into
the
house
hayes
had
taken
a
room
next
to
that
of
wood
it
was
a
protection
to
him
for
wood
would
often
rebuke
the
lad
for
using
hayes
ill
and
both
catherine
and
tom
treated
the
old
man
with
deference
at
last
it
was
after
he
had
collected
a
good
deal
of
his
money
hayes
began
to
reason
with
himself
why
should
i
stay
stay
to
be
insulted
by
that
boy
or
murdered
by
him
he
is
ready
for
any
he
determined
to
fly
he
would
send
catherine
money
every
year
no
she
had
the
furniture
let
her
let
lodgings
that
would
support
her
he
would
go
and
live
away
abroad
in
some
cheap
place
away
from
that
boy
and
his
horrible
threats
the
idea
of
freedom
was
agreeable
to
the
poor
wretch
and
he
began
to
wind
up
his
affairs
as
quickly
as
he
could
hayes
would
now
allow
no
one
to
make
his
bed
or
enter
his
room
and
wood
could
hear
him
through
the
panels
fidgeting
perpetually
to
and
fro
opening
and
shutting
of
chests
and
clinking
of
coin
at
the
least
sound
he
would
start
up
and
would
go
to
billings
door
and
listen
wood
used
to
hear
him
creeping
through
the
passages
and
returning
stealthily
to
his
own
chamber
one
day
the
woman
and
her
son
had
been
angrily
taunting
him
in
the
presence
of
a
neighbour
the
neighbour
retired
soon
and
hayes
who
had
gone
with
him
to
the
door
heard
on
returning
the
voice
of
wood
in
the
parlour
the
old
man
laughed
in
his
usual
saturnine
way
and
said
have
a
care
cat
for
if
hayes
were
to
die
suddenly
by
the
laws
the
neighbours
would
accuse
thee
of
his
hayes
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
he
too
is
in
the
plot
thought
he
they
are
all
leagued
against
me
they
will
kill
me
they
are
only
biding
their
fear
seized
him
and
he
thought
of
flying
that
instant
and
leaving
all
and
he
stole
into
his
room
and
gathered
his
money
together
but
only
a
half
of
it
was
there
in
a
few
weeks
all
would
have
come
in
he
had
not
the
heart
to
go
but
that
night
wood
heard
hayes
pause
at
his
door
before
he
went
to
listen
at
catherine
what
is
the
man
thinking
of
said
wood
he
is
gathering
his
money
together
has
he
a
hoard
yonder
unknown
to
us
all
wood
thought
he
would
watch
him
there
was
a
closet
between
the
two
rooms
wood
bored
a
hole
in
the
panel
and
peeped
through
hayes
had
a
brace
of
pistols
and
four
or
five
little
bags
before
him
on
the
table
one
of
these
he
opened
and
placed
one
by
one
guineas
into
it
such
a
sum
had
been
due
that
day
catherine
spoke
of
it
only
in
the
morning
for
the
debtor
name
had
by
chance
been
mentioned
in
the
conversation
hayes
commonly
kept
but
a
few
guineas
in
the
house
for
what
was
he
amassing
all
these
the
next
day
wood
asked
for
change
for
a
bill
hayes
said
he
had
but
three
guineas
and
when
asked
by
catherine
where
the
money
was
that
was
paid
the
day
before
said
that
it
was
at
the
banker
the
man
is
going
to
fly
said
wood
that
is
sure
if
he
does
i
know
him
he
will
leave
his
wife
without
a
he
watched
him
for
several
days
regularly
two
or
three
more
bags
were
added
to
the
former
number
they
are
pretty
things
guineas
thought
wood
and
tell
no
tales
like
and
he
thought
over
the
days
when
he
and
macshane
used
to
ride
abroad
in
search
of
them
i
do
know
what
thoughts
entered
into
wood
brain
but
the
next
day
after
seeing
young
billings
to
whom
he
actually
made
a
present
of
a
guinea
that
young
man
in
conversing
with
his
mother
said
do
you
know
mother
that
if
you
were
free
and
married
the
count
i
should
be
a
lord
it
the
german
law
wood
says
and
you
know
he
was
in
them
countries
with
ay
that
he
would
said
wood
in
germany
but
germany
england
and
it
no
use
talking
of
such
hush
child
said
hayes
quite
eagerly
how
can
marry
the
count
besides
i
married
and
is
he
too
great
a
lord
for
me
too
great
a
lord
not
a
whit
mother
if
it
was
for
hayes
i
might
be
a
lord
now
he
gave
me
five
guineas
only
last
week
but
curse
the
skinflint
who
never
will
part
with
a
it
not
so
bad
as
his
striking
your
mother
tom
i
had
my
stick
up
and
was
ready
to
fell
him
night
added
wood
and
herewith
he
smiled
and
looked
steadily
in
catherine
face
she
dared
not
look
again
but
she
felt
that
the
old
man
knew
a
secret
that
she
had
been
trying
to
hide
from
herself
fool
he
knew
it
and
hayes
knew
it
dimly
and
never
never
since
that
day
of
the
gala
had
it
left
her
sleeping
or
waking
when
hayes
in
his
fear
had
proposed
to
sleep
away
from
her
she
started
with
joy
she
had
been
afraid
that
she
might
talk
in
her
sleep
and
so
let
slip
her
horrible
confession
old
wood
knew
all
her
history
since
the
period
of
the
marylebone
fete
he
had
wormed
it
out
of
her
day
by
day
he
had
counselled
her
how
to
act
warned
her
not
to
yield
to
procure
at
least
a
certain
provision
for
her
son
and
a
handsome
settlement
for
herself
if
she
determined
on
quitting
her
husband
the
old
man
looked
on
the
business
in
a
proper
philosophical
light
told
her
bluntly
that
he
saw
she
was
bent
upon
going
off
with
the
count
and
bade
her
take
precautions
else
she
might
be
left
as
she
had
been
before
catherine
denied
all
these
charges
but
she
saw
the
count
daily
notwithstanding
and
took
all
the
measures
which
wood
had
recommended
to
her
they
were
very
prudent
ones
galgenstein
grew
hourly
more
in
love
never
had
he
felt
such
a
flame
not
in
the
best
days
of
his
youth
not
for
the
fairest
princess
countess
or
actress
from
vienna
to
paris
at
length
it
was
the
night
after
he
had
seen
hayes
counting
his
old
wood
spoke
to
hayes
very
seriously
that
husband
of
yours
cat
said
he
meditates
some
treason
ay
and
fancies
we
are
about
such
he
listens
nightly
at
your
door
and
at
mine
he

why
not
said
hayes
why

you
recollect
birmingham
do
you
think
that
galgenstein
who
is
so
tender

because
he
has
won
you
will
be
faithful
because
he
has
psha
woman
men

not
made
so
do
go
to
him
until
you
are
sure
if
you
were
a
widow
now
he
would
marry
you
but
never
leave
yourself
at
his
mercy
if
you
were
to
leave
your
husband
to
go
to
him
he
would
desert
you
in
a
fortnight
she
might
have
been
a
countess
she
knew
she
might
but
for
this
cursed
barrier
between
her
and
her
fortune
wood
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
and
smiled
grimly
besides
he
continued
remember
tom
as
sure
as
you
leave
hayes
without
some
security
from
max
the
boy
ruined
he
who
might
be
a
lord
if
his
mother
had
but
psha
never
mind
that
boy
will
go
on
the
road
as
sure
as
my
name
wood
he
a
turpin
cock
in
his
eye
my
dear
a
regular
tyburn
look
he
knows
too
many
of
that
sort
already
and
is
too
fond
of
a
bottle
and
a
girl
to
resist
and
be
honest
when
it
comes
to
the
it
all
true
said
hayes
tom
a
high
mettlesome
fellow
and
would
no
more
mind
a
ride
on
hounslow
heath
than
he
does
a
walk
now
in
the
do
you
want
him
hanged
my
dear
said
wood
ah
doctor
it
is
a
pity
and
that
sure
concluded
wood
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
closing
this
interesting
conversation
it
is
a
pity
that
that
old
skinflint
should
be
in
the
way
of
both
your
fortunes
and
he
about
to
fling
you
over
too
catherine
retired
musing
as
billings
had
previously
done
a
sweet
smile
of
contentment
lighted
up
the
venerable
features
of
doctor
wood
and
he
walked
abroad
into
the
streets
as
happy
a
fellow
as
any
in
london
chapter
xii
treats
of
love
and
prepares
for
death
and
to
begin
this
chapter
we
can
not
do
better
than
quote
a
part
of
a
letter
from
to
madame
la
comtesse
de
x
paris
madam
the
little
arouet
de
voltaire
who
hath
come
to
take
a
turn
in
england
as
i
see
by
the
post
of
this
morning
hath
brought
me
a
charming
pacquet
from
your
ladyship
hands
which
ought
to
render
a
reasonable
man
happy
but
alas
makes
your
slave
miserable
i
think
of
dear
paris
and
something
more
dear
than
all
paris
of
which
madam
i
may
not
venture
to
speak
further
i
think
of
dear
paris
and
find
myself
in
this
dismal
vitehall
where
when
the
fog
clears
up
i
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
muddy
thames
and
of
that
fatal
palace
which
the
kings
of
england
have
been
obliged
to
exchange
for
your
noble
castle
of
saint
germains
that
stands
so
stately
by
silver
seine
truly
no
bad
bargain
for
my
part
i
would
give
my
grand
ambassadorial
saloons
hangings
gildings
feasts
valets
ambassadors
and
all
for
a
bicoque
in
sight
of
the
thuilleries
towers
or
my
little
cell
in
the
irlandois
my
last
sheets
have
given
you
a
pretty
notion
of
our
public
doings
now
for
a
pretty
piece
of
private
scandal
respecting
that
great
man
figure
to
yourself
madam
his
excellency
is
in
love
actually
in
love
talking
day
and
night
about
a
certain
fair
one
whom
he
hath
picked
out
of
a
gutter
who
is
well
nigh
forty
years
old
who
was
his
mistress
when
he
was
in
england
a
captain
of
dragoons
some
sixty
seventy
or
a
hundred
years
since
who
hath
had
a
son
by
him
moreover
a
sprightly
lad
apprentice
to
a
tailor
of
eminence
that
has
the
honour
of
making
his
excellency
breeches
since
one
fatal
night
when
he
met
this
fair
creature
at
a
certain
place
of
publique
resort
called
marylebone
gardens
our
cyrus
hath
been
an
altered
creature
love
hath
mastered
this
brainless
ambassador
and
his
antics
afford
me
food
for
perpetual
mirth
he
sits
now
opposite
to
me
at
a
table
inditing
a
letter
to
his
catherine
and
copying
it
from
what
do
you
think
from
the
cyrus
swear
madam
that
my
happiness
would
be
to
offer
you
this
hand
as
i
have
my
heart
long
ago
and
i
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
this
declaration
i
have
just
dictated
to
him
the
above
tender
words
for
our
envoy
i
need
not
tell
you
is
not
strong
at
writing
or
thinking
the
fair
catherine
i
must
tell
you
is
no
less
than
a
wife
a
bourgeois
living
at
the
tyburn
or
gallows
road
she
found
out
her
ancient
lover
very
soon
after
our
arrival
and
hath
a
marvellous
hankering
to
be
a
count
lady
a
pretty
little
creature
is
this
madam
catherine
billets
breakfasts
pretty
walks
presents
of
silks
and
satins
pass
daily
between
the
pair
but
strange
to
say
the
lady
is
as
virtuous
as
diana
and
hath
resisted
all
my
cajoleries
hitherto
the
poor
fellow
told
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
believed
he
should
have
carried
her
by
storm
on
the
very
first
night
of
their
meeting
but
that
her
son
stepped
into
the
way
and
he
or
somebody
else
hath
been
in
the
way
ever
since
madam
will
never
appear
alone
i
believe
it
is
this
wondrous
chastity
of
the
lady
that
has
elicited
this
wondrous
constancy
of
the
gentleman
she
is
holding
out
for
a
settlement
who
knows
if
not
for
a
marriage
her
husband
she
says
is
ailing
her
lover
is
fool
enough
and
she
herself
conducts
her
negotiations
as
i
must
honestly
own
with
a
pretty
notion
of
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
reverend
gentleman
letter
that
directly
affects
this
history
the
rest
contains
some
scandal
concerning
greater
personages
about
the
court
a
great
share
of
abuse
of
the
elector
of
hanover
and
a
pretty
description
of
a
at
amphitheatre
in
oxford
road
where
john
wells
of
edmund
bury
as
by
the
papers
may
be
seen
master
of
the
noble
science
of
did
engage
with
edward
sutton
of
gravesend
master
of
the
said
science
and
the
issue
of
the
combat
n
adds
the
father
in
a
postscript
monsieur
figue
gives
a
hat
to
be
cudgelled
for
before
the
master
mount
and
the
whole
of
this
fashionable
information
hath
been
given
me
by
monseigneur
son
monsieur
billings
chevalier
de
billings
was
in
fact
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
ambassador
house
to
whose
presence
he
by
a
general
order
was
always
admitted
as
for
the
connection
between
catherine
and
her
former
admirer
the
abbe
history
of
it
is
perfectly
correct
nor
can
it
be
said
that
this
wretched
woman
whose
tale
now
begins
to
wear
a
darker
hue
was
in
anything
but
soul
faithless
to
her
husband
but
she
hated
him
longed
to
leave
him
and
loved
another
the
end
was
coming
quickly
and
every
one
of
our
unknowing
actors
and
actresses
were
to
be
implicated
more
or
less
in
the
catastrophe
it
will
be
seen
that
cat
had
followed
pretty
closely
the
injunctions
of
wood
in
regard
to
her
dealings
with
the
count
who
grew
more
and
tender
daily
as
the
completion
of
his
wishes
was
delayed
and
his
desires
goaded
by
contradiction
the
abbe
has
quoted
one
portion
of
a
letter
written
by
him
here
is
the
entire
performance
extracted
as
the
holy
father
said
chiefly
from
the
romance
of
the
grand
cyrus
unhappy
maximilian
unto
unjust
catherina
madam
it
must
needs
be
that
i
love
you
better
than
any
ever
did
since
notwithstanding
your
injustice
in
calling
me
perfidious
i
love
you
no
less
than
i
did
before
on
the
contrary
my
passion
is
so
violent
and
your
unjust
accusation
makes
me
so
sensible
of
it
that
if
you
did
but
know
the
resentments
of
my
soule
you
would
confess
your
selfe
the
most
cruell
and
unjust
woman
in
the
world
you
shall
ere
long
madam
see
me
at
your
feete
and
as
you
were
my
first
passion
so
you
will
be
my
last
on
my
knees
i
will
tell
you
at
the
first
handsom
opportunity
that
the
grandure
of
my
passion
can
only
be
equalled
by
your
beauty
it
hath
driven
me
to
such
a
fatall
necessity
as
that
i
can
not
hide
the
misery
which
you
have
caused
sure
the
hostil
goddes
have
to
plague
me
ordayned
that
fatal
marridge
by
which
you
are
bound
to
one
so
infinitly
below
you
in
degree
were
that
bond
of
hymen
cut
in
twayn
witch
binds
you
i
swear
madam
that
my
happiniss
woulde
be
to
offer
you
this
hande
as
i
have
my
harte
long
agoe
and
i
praye
you
to
beare
in
minde
this
declaracion
which
i
here
sign
with
my
hande
and
witch
i
pray
you
may
one
day
be
called
upon
to
prove
the
truth
on
beleave
me
madam
that
there
is
none
in
the
world
who
doth
more
honor
to
your
vertue
than
myselfe
nor
who
wishes
your
happinesse
with
more
zeal
than
maximilian
from
my
lodgings
in
whitehall
this
of
february
to
the
incomparable
catherina
these
with
a
scarlet
satten
the
count
had
debated
about
the
sentence
promising
marriage
in
event
of
hayes
death
but
the
honest
abbe
cut
these
scruples
very
short
by
saying
justly
that
because
he
wrote
in
that
manner
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
act
so
that
he
had
better
not
sign
and
address
the
note
in
full
and
that
he
presumed
his
excellency
was
not
quite
so
timid
as
to
fancy
that
the
woman
would
follow
him
all
the
way
to
germany
when
his
diplomatic
duties
would
be
ended
as
they
would
soon
the
receipt
of
this
billet
caused
such
a
flush
of
joy
and
exultation
to
unhappy
happy
catherine
that
wood
did
not
fail
to
remark
it
and
speedily
learned
the
contents
of
the
letter
wood
had
no
need
to
bid
the
poor
wretch
guard
it
very
carefully
it
never
from
that
day
forth
left
her
it
was
her
title
of
nobility
her
pass
to
rank
wealth
happiness
she
began
to
look
down
on
her
neighbours
her
manner
to
her
husband
grew
more
than
ordinarily
scornful
the
poor
vain
wretch
longed
to
tell
her
secret
and
to
take
her
place
openly
in
the
world
she
a
countess
and
tom
a
count
son
she
felt
that
she
should
royally
become
the
title
about
this
time
and
hayes
was
very
much
frightened
at
the
prevalence
of
the
rumour
it
suddenly
began
to
be
about
in
his
quarter
that
he
was
going
to
quit
the
country
the
story
was
in
everybody
mouth
people
used
to
sneer
when
he
turned
pale
and
wept
and
passionately
denied
it
it
was
said
too
that
hayes
was
not
his
wife
but
his
mistress
everybody
had
this
story
his
mistress
whom
he
treated
most
cruelly
and
was
about
to
desert
the
tale
of
the
blow
which
had
felled
her
to
the
ground
was
known
in
all
quarters
when
he
declared
that
the
woman
tried
to
stab
him
nobody
believed
him
the
women
said
he
would
have
been
served
right
if
she
had
done
so
how
had
these
stories
gone
abroad
three
days
more
and
i
will
fly
thought
hayes
and
the
world
may
say
what
it
ay
fool
fly
away
so
swiftly
that
fate
can
not
overtake
thee
hide
so
cunningly
that
death
shall
not
find
thy
place
of
refuge
chapter
xiii
being
a
preparation
for
the
end
the
reader
doubtless
doth
now
partly
understand
what
dark
acts
of
conspiracy
are
beginning
to
gather
around
hayes
and
possibly
hath
comprehended
that
if
the
rumour
was
universally
credited
which
declared
that
catherine
was
only
hayes
mistress
and
not
his
wife
she
might
if
she
so
inclined
marry
another
person
and
thereby
not
injure
her
fame
and
excite
wonderment
but
actually
add
to
her
reputation
that
if
all
the
world
did
steadfastly
believe
that
hayes
intended
to
desert
this
woman
after
having
cruelly
maltreated
her
the
direction
which
his
journey
might
take
would
be
of
no
consequence
and
he
might
go
to
highgate
to
edinburgh
to
constantinople
nay
down
a
well
and
no
soul
would
care
to
ask
whither
he
had
gone
these
points
hayes
had
not
considered
duly
the
latter
case
had
been
put
to
him
and
annoyed
him
as
we
have
seen
the
former
had
actually
been
pressed
upon
him
by
hayes
herself
who
in
almost
the
only
communication
she
had
had
with
him
since
their
last
quarrel
had
asked
him
angrily
in
the
presence
of
wood
and
her
son
whether
he
had
dared
to
utter
such
lies
and
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
neighbours
looked
scornfully
at
her
and
avoided
her
to
this
charge
hayes
pleaded
very
meekly
that
he
was
not
guilty
and
young
billings
taking
him
by
the
collar
and
clinching
his
fist
in
his
face
swore
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
have
the
life
of
him
if
he
dared
abuse
his
mother
hayes
then
spoke
of
the
general
report
abroad
that
he
was
going
to
desert
her
which
if
he
attempted
to
do
billings
vowed
that
he
would
follow
him
to
jerusalem
and
have
his
blood
these
threats
and
the
insolent
language
of
young
billings
rather
calmed
hayes
than
agitated
him
he
longed
to
be
on
his
journey
but
he
began
to
hope
that
no
obstacle
would
be
placed
in
the
way
of
it
for
the
first
time
since
many
days
he
began
to
enjoy
a
feeling
something
akin
to
security
and
could
look
with
tolerable
confidence
towards
a
comfortable
completion
of
his
own
schemes
of
treason
these
points
being
duly
settled
we
are
now
arrived
o
public
at
a
point
for
which
the
author
soul
hath
been
yearning
ever
since
this
history
commenced
we
are
now
come
o
critic
to
a
stage
of
the
work
when
this
tale
begins
to
assume
an
appearance
so
interestingly
horrific
that
you
must
have
a
heart
of
stone
if
you
are
not
interested
by
it
o
candid
and
discerning
reader
who
art
sick
of
the
hideous
scenes
of
brutal
bloodshed
which
have
of
late
come
forth
from
pens
of
certain
eminent
wits
if
you
turn
away
disgusted
from
the
book
remember
that
this
passage
hath
not
been
written
for
you
or
such
as
you
who
have
taste
to
know
and
hate
the
style
in
which
it
hath
been
composed
but
for
the
public
which
hath
no
such
taste
for
the
public
which
can
patronise
four
different
representations
of
jack
sheppard
for
the
public
whom
its
literary
providers
have
gorged
with
blood
and
foul
newgate
garbage
and
to
whom
we
poor
creatures
humbly
following
at
the
tail
of
our
great
and
prophets
of
the
press
may
as
in
duty
bound
offer
some
small
gift
of
our
own
a
little
mite
truly
but
given
with
come
up
then
fair
catherine
and
brave
count
appear
gallant
brock
and
faultless
billings
hasten
hither
honest
john
hayes
the
former
chapters
are
but
flowers
in
which
we
have
been
decking
you
for
the
sacrifice
ascend
to
the
altar
ye
innocent
lambs
and
prepare
for
the
final
act
lo
the
knife
is
sharpened
and
the
sacrificer
ready
stretch
your
throats
sweet
ones
for
the
public
is
thirsty
and
must
have
blood
this
was
written
in
chapter
the
last
that
hayes
had
some
notion
of
the
attachment
of
monsieur
de
galgenstein
for
his
wife
is
very
certain
the
man
could
not
but
perceive
that
she
was
more
gaily
dressed
and
more
frequently
absent
than
usual
and
must
have
been
quite
aware
that
from
the
day
of
the
quarrel
until
the
present
period
catherine
had
never
asked
him
for
a
shilling
for
the
house
expenses
he
had
not
the
heart
to
offer
however
nor
in
truth
did
she
seem
to
remember
that
money
was
due
she
received
in
fact
many
sums
from
the
tender
count
tom
was
likewise
liberally
provided
by
the
same
personage
who
was
moreover
continually
sending
presents
of
various
kinds
to
the
person
on
whom
his
affections
were
centred
one
of
these
gifts
was
a
hamper
of
choice
which
had
been
some
weeks
in
the
house
and
excited
the
longing
of
hayes
who
loved
wine
very
much
this
liquor
was
generally
drunk
by
wood
and
billings
who
applauded
it
greatly
and
many
times
in
passing
through
the
which
he
had
to
traverse
in
order
to
reach
the
stair
hayes
had
cast
a
tender
eye
towards
the
drink
of
which
had
he
dared
he
would
have
partaken
on
the
of
march
in
the
year
hayes
had
gathered
together
almost
the
whole
sum
with
which
he
intended
to
decamp
and
having
on
that
very
day
recovered
the
amount
of
a
bill
which
he
thought
almost
hopeless
he
returned
home
in
tolerable
and
feeling
so
near
was
his
period
of
departure
something
like
security
nobody
had
attempted
the
least
violence
on
him
besides
he
was
armed
with
pistols
had
his
money
in
bills
in
a
belt
about
his
person
and
really
reasoned
with
himself
that
there
was
no
danger
for
him
to
apprehend
he
entered
the
house
about
dusk
at
five
hayes
was
absent
with
billings
only
wood
was
smoking
according
to
his
wont
in
the
little
and
as
hayes
passed
the
old
gentleman
addressed
him
in
a
friendly
voice
and
wondering
that
he
had
been
such
a
stranger
invited
him
to
sit
and
take
a
glass
of
wine
there
was
a
light
and
a
foreman
in
the
shop
hayes
gave
his
injunctions
to
that
person
and
saw
no
objection
to
wood
invitation
the
conversation
at
first
a
little
stiff
between
the
two
gentlemen
began
speedily
to
grow
more
easy
and
confidential
and
so
particularly
bland
and
was
or
doctor
wood
that
his
companion
was
quite
caught
and
softened
by
the
charm
of
his
manner
and
the
pair
became
as
good
friends
as
in
the
former
days
of
their
intercourse
i
wish
you
would
come
down
sometimes
of
evenings
quoth
doctor
wood
for
though
no
man
hayes
look
you
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
ca
abide
the
society
of
boys
there
tom
now
since
this
tiff
with
cat
the
scoundrel
plays
the
grank
turk
here
the
pair
of
betwixt
them
have
completely
gotten
the
upper
hand
of
you
confess
that
you
are
beaten
master
hayes
and
do
like
the
boy
no
more
i
do
said
hayes
and
that
the
truth
o
a
man
doth
not
like
to
have
his
wife
sins
flung
in
his
face
nor
to
be
perpetually
bullied
in
his
own
house
by
such
a
fiery
sprig
as
mischief
sir
mischief
only
said
wood
is
the
fun
of
youth
sir
and
will
go
off
as
age
comes
to
the
lad
bad
as
you
may
think
him
and
he
is
as
skittish
and
fierce
sure
enough
as
a
young
colt
is
good
stuff
in
him
and
though
he
hath
or
fancies
he
hath
the
right
to
abuse
every
one
by
the
lord
he
will
let
none
others
do
so
last
week
now
did
he
tell
cat
that
you
served
her
right
in
the
last
beating
matter
and
were
they
coming
to
knives
just
as
in
your
case
by
my
faith
they
were
ay
and
at
the
braund
head
when
some
fellow
said
that
you
were
a
bloody
bluebeard
and
would
murder
your
wife
stab
me
if
tom
was
up
in
an
instant
and
knocked
the
fellow
down
for
abusing
of
you
the
first
of
these
stories
was
quite
true
the
second
was
only
a
charitable
invention
of
wood
and
employed
doubtless
for
the
amiable
purpose
of
bringing
the
old
and
young
men
together
the
scheme
partially
succeeded
for
though
hayes
was
not
so
far
mollified
towards
tom
as
to
entertain
any
affection
for
a
young
man
whom
he
had
cordially
detested
ever
since
he
knew
him
yet
he
felt
more
at
ease
and
cheerful
regarding
himself
and
surely
not
without
reason
while
indulging
in
these
benevolent
sentiments
catherine
and
her
son
arrived
and
found
somewhat
to
their
astonishment
hayes
seated
in
the
as
in
former
times
and
they
were
invited
by
wood
to
sit
down
and
drink
we
have
said
that
certain
bottles
of
were
presented
by
the
count
to
catherine
these
were
at
wood
suggestion
produced
and
hayes
who
had
long
been
coveting
them
was
charmed
to
have
an
opportunity
to
drink
his
fill
he
forthwith
began
bragging
of
his
great
powers
as
a
drinker
and
vowed
that
he
could
manage
eight
bottles
without
becoming
intoxicated
wood
grinned
strangely
and
looked
in
a
peculiar
way
at
tom
billings
who
grinned
too
cat
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
ground
but
her
face
was
deadly
pale
the
party
began
drinking
hayes
kept
up
his
reputation
as
a
toper
and
swallowed
one
two
three
bottles
without
wincing
he
grew
talkative
and
merry
and
began
to
sing
songs
and
to
cut
jokes
at
which
wood
laughed
hugely
and
billings
after
him
cat
could
not
laugh
but
sat
silent
what
ailed
her
was
she
thinking
of
the
count
she
had
been
with
max
that
day
and
had
promised
him
for
the
next
night
at
ten
an
interview
near
his
lodgings
at
whitehall
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
would
see
him
alone
they
were
to
meet
not
a
very
cheerful
place
for
a
at
margaret
churchyard
near
westminster
abbey
of
this
no
doubt
cat
was
thinking
but
what
could
she
mean
by
whispering
to
wood
no
no
for
god
sake
not
tonight
she
means
we
are
to
have
no
more
liquor
said
wood
to
hayes
who
heard
this
sentence
and
seemed
rather
alarmed
that
it
no
more
liquor
said
catherine
eagerly
you
have
had
enough
go
to
bed
and
lock
your
door
and
sleep
but
i
say
i
not
had
enough
drink
screamed
hayes
i
good
for
five
bottles
more
and
wager
i
will
drink
them
done
for
a
guinea
said
wood
done
and
done
said
billings
be
you
quiet
growled
hayes
scowling
at
the
lad
i
will
drink
what
i
please
and
ask
no
counsel
of
and
he
muttered
some
more
curses
against
young
billings
which
showed
what
his
feelings
were
towards
his
wife
son
and
which
the
latter
for
a
wonder
only
received
with
a
scornful
smile
and
a
knowing
look
at
wood
well
the
five
extra
bottles
were
brought
and
drunk
by
hayes
and
seasoned
by
many
songs
from
the
recueil
of
thomas
and
others
the
chief
part
of
the
talk
and
merriment
was
on
hayes
part
as
indeed
was
natural
for
while
he
drank
bottle
after
bottle
of
wine
the
other
two
gentlemen
confined
themselves
to
small
beer
both
pleading
illness
as
an
excuse
for
their
sobriety
and
now
might
we
depict
with
much
accuracy
the
course
of
intoxication
as
it
rose
from
the
merriment
of
the
point
to
the
madness
of
the
four
from
the
uproarious
quarrelsomeness
of
the
sixth
bottle
to
the
sickly
stupidity
of
the
seventh
but
we
are
desirous
of
bringing
this
tale
to
a
conclusion
and
must
pretermit
all
consideration
of
a
subject
so
curious
so
instructive
and
so
delightful
suffice
it
to
say
as
a
matter
of
history
that
hayes
did
actually
drink
seven
bottles
of
and
that
thomas
billings
went
to
the
braund
head
in
bond
street
and
purchased
another
which
hayes
likewise
drank
that
do
said
wood
to
young
billings
and
they
led
hayes
up
to
bed
whither
in
truth
he
was
unable
to
walk
himself
springatt
the
lodger
came
down
to
ask
what
the
noise
was
is
only
tom
billings
making
merry
with
some
friends
from
the
country
answered
hayes
whereupon
springatt
retired
and
the
house
was
quiet
some
scuffling
and
stamping
was
heard
about
eleven
after
they
had
seen
hayes
to
bed
billings
remembered
that
he
had
a
parcel
to
carry
to
some
person
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
strand
and
as
the
night
was
remarkably
fine
he
and
wood
agreed
to
walk
together
and
set
forth
accordingly
here
follows
a
description
of
the
thames
at
midnight
in
a
fine
historical
style
with
an
account
of
lambeth

a
continuall
street
than
a
bridge
of
bankside
and
the

and
the

of
the

of
slim
wherries
sleeping
on

banks
and
basking
and
shining
in
the
moonbeams
a
combat
on

described

between

chiefs

for
his

was
grasped
too
tight
in
the
iron
clench
of
the
city
champion
but
drawing
his
snickersnee
he
plunged
it
seven
times
in
the
bailiff
chest
still
the
latter
fell
not

in
the

of

and
in

quarter
a

displayed
of

he
thrust
the

away
from
his
own
and
at
once
the
bodies
of
the
captains
plunged
down
down
down
down
in
the
unfathomable
waters
after
this
follows
another
episode
two
masked
ladies

at
the
door
of
a
tavern
overlooking
the
thames
they
turn
out
to
be

act
of

bolingbroke
and
pope
two
fellows
are
sitting
shuddering
under
a
doorway
to
one
of
them
tom
billings
flung
a
sixpence
he
little
knew
that
the
names
of
those
two
young
men
were
samuel
johnson
and
richard
savage
another
last
chapter
hayes
did
not
join
the
family
the
next
day
and
it
appears
that
the
previous
night
reconciliation
was
not
very
durable
for
when
springatt
asked
wood
for
hayes
wood
stated
that
hayes
had
gone
away
without
saying
whither
he
was
bound
or
how
long
he
might
be
absent
he
only
said
in
rather
a
sulky
tone
that
he
should
probably
pass
the
night
at
a
friend
house
for
my
part
i
know
of
no
friend
he
hath
added
wood
and
pray
heaven
that
he
may
not
think
of
deserting
his
poor
wife
whom
he
hath
beaten
and
so
already
in
this
prayer
springatt
joined
and
so
these
two
worthy
people
parted
what
business
billings
was
about
can
not
be
said
but
he
was
this
night
bound
towards
marylebone
fields
as
he
was
the
night
before
for
the
strand
and
westminster
and
although
the
night
was
very
stormy
and
rainy
as
the
previous
evening
had
been
fine
old
wood
resolved
upon
accompanying
him
and
forth
they
sallied
together
catherine
too
had
her
business
as
we
have
seen
but
this
was
of
a
very
delicate
nature
at
nine
she
had
an
appointment
with
the
count
and
faithfully
by
that
hour
had
found
her
way
to
saint
margaret
churchyard
near
westminster
abbey
where
she
awaited
monsieur
de
galgenstein
the
spot
was
convenient
being
very
lonely
and
at
the
same
time
close
to
the
count
lodgings
at
whitehall
his
excellency
came
but
somewhat
after
the
hour
for
to
say
the
truth
being
a
freethinker
he
had
the
most
firm
belief
in
ghosts
and
demons
and
did
not
care
to
pace
a
churchyard
alone
he
was
comforted
therefore
when
he
saw
a
woman
muffled
in
a
cloak
who
held
out
her
hand
to
him
at
the
gate
and
said
is
that
you
he
took
her
hand
it
was
very
clammy
and
cold
and
at
her
desire
he
bade
his
confidential
footman
who
had
attended
him
with
a
torch
to
retire
and
leave
him
to
himself
the
retired
and
left
them
quite
in
darkness
and
the
pair
entered
the
little
cemetery
cautiously
threading
their
way
among
the
tombs
they
sat
down
on
one
underneath
a
tree
it
seemed
to
be
the
wind
was
very
cold
and
its
piteous
howling
was
the
only
noise
that
broke
the
silence
of
the
place
catherine
teeth
were
chattering
for
all
her
wraps
and
when
max
drew
her
close
to
him
and
encircled
her
waist
with
one
arm
and
pressed
her
hand
she
did
not
repulse
him
but
rather
came
close
to
him
and
with
her
own
damp
fingers
feebly
returned
his
pressure
the
poor
thing
was
very
wretched
and
weeping
she
confided
to
max
the
cause
of
her
grief
she
was
alone
in
the
world
alone
and
penniless
her
husband
had
left
her
she
had
that
very
day
received
a
letter
from
him
which
confirmed
all
that
she
had
suspected
so
long
he
had
left
her
carried
away
all
his
property
and
would
not
return
if
we
say
that
a
selfish
joy
filled
the
breast
of
monsieur
de
galgenstein
the
reader
will
not
be
astonished
a
heartless
libertine
he
felt
glad
at
the
prospect
of
catherine
ruin
for
he
hoped
that
necessity
would
make
her
his
own
he
clasped
the
poor
thing
to
his
heart
and
vowed
that
he
would
replace
the
husband
she
had
lost
and
that
his
fortune
should
be
hers
will
you
replace
him
said
she
yes
truly
in
everything
but
the
name
dear
catherine
and
when
he
dies
i
swear
you
shall
be
countess
of
will
you
swear
she
cried
eagerly
by
everything
that
is
most
sacred
were
you
free
now
i
would
and
here
he
swore
a
terrific
oath
at
once
make
you
we
have
seen
before
that
it
cost
monsieur
de
galgenstein
nothing
to
make
these
vows
hayes
was
likely
too
to
live
as
long
as
catherine
as
long
at
least
as
the
count
connection
with
her
but
he
was
caught
in
his
own
snare
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
repeatedly
and
bathed
it
in
her
tears
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
max
she
said
i
am
free
be
mine
and
i
will
love
you
as
i
have
done
for
years
and
max
started
back
what
is
he
dead
he
said
no
no
not
dead
but
he
never
was
my
he
let
go
her
hand
and
interrupting
her
said
sharply
indeed
madam
if
this
carpenter
never
was
your
husband
i
see
no
cause
why
should
be
if
a
lady
who
hath
been
for
twenty
years
the
mistress
of
a
miserable
country
boor
can
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
put
up
with
the
protection
of
a
nobleman
a
sovereign
representative
she
may
seek
a
husband
elsewhere
i
was
no
man
mistress
except
yours
sobbed
catherine
wringing
her
hands
and
sobbing
wildly
but
o
heaven
i
deserved
this
because
i
was
a
child
and
you
saw
and
ruined
and
left
me
because
in
my
sorrow
and
repentance
i
wished
to
repair
my
crime
and
was
touched
by
that
love
and
married
him
because
he
too
deceives
and
leaves
me
because
after
loving
you
madly
loving
you
for
twenty
years
i
will
not
now
forfeit
your
respect
and
degrade
myself
by
yielding
to
your
will
you
too
must
scorn
me
it
is
too
much
too
much
o
heaven
and
the
wretched
woman
fell
back
almost
fainting
max
was
almost
frightened
by
this
burst
of
sorrow
on
her
part
and
was
coming
forward
to
support
her
but
she
motioned
him
away
and
taking
from
her
bosom
a
letter
said
if
it
were
light
you
could
see
max
how
cruelly
i
have
been
betrayed
by
that
man
who
called
himself
my
husband
long
before
he
married
me
he
was
married
to
another
this
woman
is
still
living
he
says
and
he
says
he
leaves
me
for
at
this
moment
the
moon
which
had
been
hidden
behind
westminster
abbey
rose
above
the
vast
black
mass
of
that
edifice
and
poured
a
flood
of
silver
light
upon
the
little
church
of
margaret
and
the
spot
where
the
lovers
stood
max
was
at
a
little
distance
from
catherine
pacing
gloomily
up
and
down
the
flags
she
remained
at
her
old
position
at
the
tombstone
under
the
tree
or
pillar
as
it
seemed
to
be
as
the
moon
got
up
she
was
leaning
against
the
pillar
and
holding
out
to
max
with
an
arm
beautifully
white
and
rounded
the
letter
she
had
received
from
her
husband
read
it
max
she
said
i
asked
for
light
and
here
is
heaven
own
by
which
you
may
but
max
did
not
come
forward
to
receive
it
on
a
sudden
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
the
most
dreadful
surprise
and
agony
he
stood
still
and
stared
with
wild
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
he
stared
upwards
at
a
point
seemingly
above
catherine
head
at
last
he
raised
up
his
finger
slowly
and
said
look
cat
the
head
the
head
then
uttering
a
horrible
laugh
he
fell
down
grovelling
among
the
stones
gibbering
and
writhing
in
a
fit
of
epilepsy
catherine
started
forward
and
looked
up
she
had
been
standing
against
a
post
not
a
tree
the
moon
was
shining
full
on
it
now
and
on
the
summit
strangely
distinct
and
smiling
ghastly
was
a
livid
human
head
the
wretched
woman
fled
she
dared
look
no
more
and
some
hours
afterwards
when
alarmed
by
the
count
continued
absence
his
confidential
servant
came
back
to
seek
for
him
in
the
churchyard
he
was
found
sitting
on
the
flags
staring
full
at
the
head
and
laughing
and
talking
to
it
wildly
and
nodding
at
it
he
was
taken
up
a
hopeless
idiot
and
so
lived
for
years
and
years
clanking
the
chain
and
moaning
under
the
lash
and
howling
through
long
nights
when
the
moon
peered
through
the
bars
of
his
solitary
cell
and
he
buried
his
face
in
the
straw
there
the
murder
is
out
and
having
indulged
himself
in
a
chapter
of
the
very
finest
writing
the
author
begs
the
attention
of
the
british
public
towards
it
humbly
conceiving
that
it
possesses
some
of
those
peculiar
merits
which
have
rendered
the
fine
writing
in
other
chapters
of
the
works
of
other
authors
so
famous
without
bragging
at
all
let
us
just
point
out
the
chief
claims
of
the
above
pleasing
piece
of
composition
in
the
first
place
it
is
perfectly
stilted
and
unnatural
the
dialogue
and
the
sentiments
being
artfully
arranged
so
as
to
be
as
strong
and
majestic
as
possible
our
dear
cat
is
but
a
poor
illiterate
country
wench
who
has
come
from
cutting
her
husband
throat
and
yet
see
she
talks
and
looks
like
a
tragedy
princess
who
is
suffering
in
the
most
virtuous
blank
verse
this
is
the
proper
end
of
fiction
and
one
of
the
greatest
triumphs
that
a
novelist
can
achieve
for
to
make
people
sympathise
with
virtue
is
a
vulgar
trick
that
any
common
fellow
can
do
but
it
is
not
everybody
who
can
take
a
scoundrel
and
cause
us
to
weep
and
whimper
over
him
as
though
he
were
a
very
saint
give
a
young
lady
of
five
years
old
a
skein
of
silk
and
a
brace
of
and
she
will
in
a
short
time
turn
you
out
a
decent
silk
purse
anybody
can
but
try
her
with
a
sow
ear
and
see
whether
she
can
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
that
that
is
the
work
for
your
real
great
artist
and
pleasant
it
is
to
see
how
many
have
succeeded
in
these
latter
days
the
subject
is
strictly
historical
as
anyone
may
see
by
referring
to
the
daily
post
of
march
which
contains
the
following
paragraph
yesterday
morning
early
a
man
head
that
by
the
freshness
of
it
seemed
to
have
been
newly
cut
off
from
the
body
having
its
own
hair
on
was
found
by
the
river
side
near
millbank
westminster
and
was
afterwards
exposed
to
public
view
in
margaret
churchyard
where
thousands
of
people
have
seen
it
but
none
could
tell
who
the
unhappy
person
was
much
less
who
committed
such
a
horrid
and
barbarous
action
there
are
various
conjectures
relating
to
the
deceased
but
there
being
nothing
certain
we
omit
them
the
head
was
much
hacked
and
mangled
in
the
cutting
the
head
which
caused
such
an
impression
upon
monsieur
de
galgenstein
was
indeed
once
on
the
shoulders
of
john
hayes
who
lost
it
under
the
following
circumstances
we
have
seen
how
hayes
was
induced
to
drink
hayes
having
been
encouraged
in
drinking
the
wine
and
growing
very
merry
therewith
he
sang
and
danced
about
the
room
but
his
wife
fearing
the
quantity
he
had
drunk
would
not
have
the
effect
on
him
she
sent
away
for
another
bottle
of
which
he
drank
also
this
effectually
answered
their
expectations
and
hayes
became
thereby
intoxicated
and
deprived
of
his
understanding
he
however
made
shift
to
get
into
the
other
room
and
throwing
himself
upon
the
bed
fell
asleep
upon
which
hayes
reminded
them
of
the
affair
in
hand
and
told
them
that
was
the
most
proper
juncture
to
finish
the
business
the
description
of
the
murder
and
the
execution
of
the
culprits
which
here
follows
in
the
original
was
taken
from
the
newspapers
of
the
day
coming
from
such
a
source
they
have
as
may
be
imagined
no
literary
merit
whatever
the
details
of
the
crime
are
simply
horrible
without
one
touch
of
even
that
sort
of
romance
which
sometimes
gives
a
little
dignity
to
murder
as
such
they
precisely
suited
thackeray
purpose
at
the
time
which
was
to
show
the
real
manners
and
customs
of
the
sheppards
and
turpins
who
were
then
the
popular
heroes
of
fiction
but
nowadays
there
is
no
such
purpose
to
serve
and
therefore
these
too
literal
details
are
omitted
ring
ding
ding
the
gloomy
green
curtain
drops
the
dramatis
personae
are
duly
disposed
of
the
nimble
candle
snuffers
put
out
the
lights
and
the
audience
goeth
pondering
home
if
the
critic
take
the
pains
to
ask
why
the
author
who
hath
been
so
diffuse
in
describing
the
early
and
fabulous
acts
of
catherine
existence
should
so
hurry
off
the
catastrophe
where
a
deal
of
the
very
finest
writing
might
have
been
employed
solomons
replies
that
the
ordinary
narrative
is
far
more
emphatic
than
any
composition
of
his
own
could
be
with
all
the
rhetorical
graces
which
he
might
employ
aram
trial
as
taken
by
the
of
those
days
had
always
interested
him
more
than
the
lengthened
and
poetical
report
which
an
eminent
novelist
has
given
of
the
same
turpin
adventures
are
more
instructive
and
agreeable
to
him
in
the
account
of
the
newgate
plutarch
than
in
the
learned
ainsworth
biographical
dictionary
and
as
he
believes
that
the
professional
gentlemen
who
are
employed
to
invest
such
heroes
with
the
rewards
that
their
great
actions
merit
will
go
through
the
ceremony
of
the
grand
cordon
with
much
more
accuracy
and
despatch
than
can
be
shown
by
the
most
distinguished
amateur
in
like
manner
he
thinks
that
the
history
of
such
investitures
should
be
written
by
people
directly
concerned
and
not
by
admiring
persons
without
who
must
be
ignorant
of
many
of
the
secrets
of
ketchcraft
we
very
much
doubt
if
milton
himself
could
make
a
description
of
an
execution
half
so
horrible
as
the
simple
lines
in
the
daily
post
of
a
hundred
and
ten
years
since
that
now
lies
before
us
herrlich
wie
am
ersten
tag
as
bright
and
clean
as
on
the
day
of
publication
think
of
it
it
has
been
read
by
belinda
at
her
toilet
scanned
at
button
and
will
sneered
at
by
wits
talked
of
in
palaces
and
cottages
by
a
busy
race
in
wigs
red
heels
hoops
patches
and
rags
of
all
variety
a
busy
race
that
hath
long
since
plunged
and
vanished
in
the
unfathomable
gulf
towards
which
we
march
so
briskly
where
are
they
afflavit
deus
and
they
are
gone
hark
is
not
the
same
wind
roaring
still
that
shall
sweep
us
down
and
yonder
stands
the
compositor
at
his
types
who
shall
put
up
a
pretty
paragraph
some
day
to
say
how
yesterday
at
his
house
in
grosvenor
square
or
at
botany
bay
universally
regretted
died
into
what
profound
moralities
is
the
paragraph
concerning
catherine
burning
leading
us
ay
truly
and
to
that
very
point
have
we
wished
to
come
for
having
finished
our
delectable
meal
it
behoves
us
to
say
a
word
or
two
by
way
of
grace
at
its
conclusion
and
be
heartily
thankful
that
it
is
over
it
has
been
the
writer
object
carefully
to
exclude
from
his
drama
except
in
two
very
insignificant
instances
mere
parts
any
characters
but
those
of
scoundrels
of
the
very
highest
degree
that
he
has
not
altogether
failed
in
the
object
he
had
in
view
is
evident
from
some
newspaper
critiques
which
he
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
and
which
abuse
the
tale
of
catherine
as
one
of
the
dullest
most
vulgar
and
immoral
works
extant
it
is
highly
gratifying
to
the
author
to
find
that
such
opinions
are
abroad
as
they
convince
him
that
the
taste
for
newgate
literature
is
on
the
wane
and
that
when
the
public
critic
has
right
down
undisguised
immorality
set
before
him
the
honest
creature
is
shocked
at
it
as
he
should
be
and
can
declare
his
indignation
in
good
round
terms
of
abuse
the
characters
of
the
tale
are
immoral
and
no
doubt
of
it
but
the
writer
humbly
hopes
the
end
is
not
so
the
public
was
in
our
notion
dosed
and
poisoned
by
the
prevailing
style
of
literary
practice
and
it
was
necessary
to
administer
some
medicine
that
would
produce
a
wholesome
nausea
and
afterwards
bring
about
a
more
healthy
habit
and
thank
heaven
this
effect
has
been
produced
in
very
many
instances
and
that
the
catherine
cathartic
has
acted
most
efficaciously
the
author
has
been
pleased
at
the
disgust
which
his
work
has
excited
and
has
watched
with
benevolent
carefulness
the
wry
faces
that
have
been
made
by
many
of
the
patients
who
have
swallowed
the
dose
solomons
remembers
at
the
establishment
in
birchin
lane
where
he
had
the
honour
of
receiving
his
education
there
used
to
be
administered
to
the
boys
a
certain
which
was
so
excessively
agreeable
that
all
the
lads
longed
to
have
colds
in
order
to
partake
of
the
remedy
some
of
our
popular
novelists
have
compounded
their
drugs
in
a
similar
way
and
made
them
so
palatable
that
a
public
once
healthy
and
honest
has
been
poisoned
by
their
wares
solomons
defies
anyone
to
say
the
like
of
himself
that
his
doses
have
been
as
pleasant
as
champagne
and
his
pills
as
sweet
as
it
has
been
his
attempt
to
make
vice
to
appear
entirely
vicious
and
in
those
instances
where
he
hath
occasionally
introduced
something
like
virtue
to
make
the
sham
as
evident
as
possible
and
not
allow
the
meanest
capacity
a
single
chance
to
mistake
it
and
what
has
been
the
consequence
that
wholesome
nausea
which
it
has
been
his
good
fortune
to
create
wherever
he
has
been
allowed
to
practise
in
his
humble
circle
has
anyone
thrown
away
a
halfpennyworth
of
sympathy
upon
any
person
mentioned
in
this
history
surely
no
but
abler
and
more
famous
men
than
solomons
have
taken
a
different
plan
and
it
becomes
every
man
in
his
vocation
to
cry
out
against
such
and
expose
their
errors
as
best
he
may
labouring
under
such
ideas
isaac
solomons
junior
produced
the
romance
of
cat
and
confesses
himself
completely
happy
to
have
brought
it
to
a
conclusion
his
poem
may
be
dull
ay
and
probably
is
the
great
blackmore
the
great
dennis
the
great
sprat
the
great
pomfret
not
to
mention
great
men
of
our
own
time
have
they
not
also
been
dull
and
had
pretty
reputations
too
be
it
granted
solomons
is
dull
but
do
attack
his
morality
he
humbly
submits
that
in
his
poem
no
man
shall
mistake
virtue
for
vice
no
man
shall
allow
a
single
sentiment
of
pity
or
admiration
to
enter
his
bosom
for
any
character
of
the
piece
it
being
from
beginning
to
end
a
scene
of
unmixed
rascality
performed
by
persons
who
never
deviate
into
good
feeling
and
although
he
doth
not
pretend
to
equal
the
great
modern
authors
whom
he
hath
mentioned
in
wit
or
descriptive
power
yet
in
the
point
of
moral
he
meekly
believes
that
he
has
been
their
superior
feeling
the
greatest
disgust
for
the
characters
he
describes
and
using
his
humble
endeavour
to
cause
the
public
also
to
hate
them
