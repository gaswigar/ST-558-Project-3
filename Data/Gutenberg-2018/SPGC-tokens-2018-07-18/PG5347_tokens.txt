chapter
i
aunt
harriet
has
a
cough
when
this
story
begins
elizabeth
ann
who
is
the
heroine
of
it
was
a
little
girl
of
nine
who
lived
with
her
harriet
in
a
city
in
a
state
in
the
middle
of
this
country
and
that
all
you
need
to
know
about
the
place
for
it
not
the
important
thing
in
the
story
and
anyhow
you
know
all
about
it
because
it
was
probably
very
much
like
the
place
you
live
in
yourself
elizabeth
ann
harriet
was
a
widow
who
was
not
very
rich
or
very
poor
and
she
had
one
daughter
frances
who
gave
piano
lessons
to
little
girls
they
kept
a
girl
whose
name
was
grace
and
who
had
asthma
dreadfully
and
was
very
much
of
a
girl
at
all
being
nearer
fifty
than
forty
aunt
harriet
who
was
very
kept
her
chiefly
because
she
could
get
any
other
place
on
account
of
her
coughing
so
you
could
hear
her
all
over
the
house
so
now
you
know
the
names
of
all
the
household
and
this
is
how
they
looked
aunt
harriet
was
very
small
and
thin
and
old
grace
was
very
small
and
thin
and
aunt
frances
for
elizabeth
ann
called
her
aunt
although
she
was
really
of
course
a
was
small
and
thin
and
if
the
light
too
strong
might
be
called
young
and
elizabeth
ann
was
very
small
and
thin
and
little
and
yet
they
all
had
plenty
to
eat
i
wonder
what
was
the
matter
with
them
it
was
certainly
not
because
they
were
not
good
for
no
womenkind
in
all
the
world
had
kinder
hearts
than
they
you
have
heard
how
aunt
harriet
kept
grace
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
a
very
depressing
person
on
account
of
her
asthma
and
when
elizabeth
ann
father
and
mother
both
died
when
she
was
a
baby
although
there
were
many
other
cousins
and
uncles
and
aunts
in
the
family
these
two
women
fairly
rushed
upon
the
little
taking
her
home
and
surrounding
her
henceforth
with
the
most
loving
devotion
they
had
said
to
themselves
that
it
was
their
manifest
duty
to
save
the
dear
little
thing
from
the
other
relatives
who
had
no
idea
about
how
to
bring
up
a
sensitive
impressionable
child
and
they
were
sure
from
the
way
elizabeth
ann
looked
at
six
months
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
sensitive
impressionable
child
it
is
possible
also
that
they
were
a
little
bored
with
their
empty
life
in
their
rather
forlorn
little
brick
house
in
the
city
and
that
they
welcomed
the
occupation
and
new
interests
which
a
child
would
bring
in
but
they
thought
that
they
chiefly
desired
to
save
dear
edward
child
from
the
other
kin
especially
from
the
putney
cousins
who
had
written
down
from
their
vermont
farm
that
they
would
be
glad
to
take
the
little
girl
into
their
family
but
anything
but
the
putneys
said
aunt
harriet
a
great
many
times
they
were
related
only
by
marriage
to
her
and
she
had
her
own
opinion
of
them
as
a
stiffnecked
undemonstrative
and
hard
set
of
new
englanders
i
boarded
near
them
one
summer
when
you
were
a
baby
frances
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
way
they
were
treating
some
children
visiting
there
oh
no
i
mean
they
abused
them
or
beat
them
but
such
lack
of
sympathy
such
perfect
indifference
to
the
sacred
sensitiveness
of
such
a
starving
of
the
no
i
shall
never
forget
it
they
had
chores
to
do
as
though
they
had
been
hired
men
aunt
harriet
never
meant
to
say
any
of
this
when
elizabeth
ann
could
hear
but
the
little
girl
ears
were
as
sharp
as
little
girls
ears
always
are
and
long
before
she
was
nine
she
knew
all
about
the
opinion
aunt
harriet
had
of
the
putneys
she
did
not
know
to
be
sure
what
chores
were
but
she
took
it
confidently
from
aunt
harriet
voice
that
they
were
something
very
very
dreadful
there
was
certainly
neither
coldness
nor
hardness
in
the
way
aunt
harriet
and
aunt
frances
treated
elizabeth
ann
they
had
really
given
themselves
up
to
the
new
responsibility
especially
aunt
frances
who
was
very
conscientious
about
everything
as
soon
as
the
baby
came
there
to
live
aunt
frances
stopped
reading
novels
and
magazines
and
one
book
after
another
which
told
her
how
to
bring
up
children
and
she
joined
a
mothers
club
which
met
once
a
week
and
she
took
a
correspondence
course
in
mothercraft
from
a
school
in
chicago
which
teaches
that
business
by
mail
so
you
can
see
that
by
the
time
elizabeth
ann
was
nine
years
old
aunt
frances
must
have
known
all
that
anybody
can
know
about
how
to
bring
up
children
and
elizabeth
ann
got
the
benefit
of
it
all
she
and
her
aunt
frances
were
simply
inseparable
aunt
frances
shared
in
all
elizabeth
ann
doings
and
even
in
all
her
thoughts
she
was
especially
anxious
to
share
all
the
little
girl
thoughts
because
she
felt
that
the
trouble
with
most
children
is
that
they
are
not
understood
and
she
was
determined
that
she
would
thoroughly
understand
elizabeth
ann
down
to
the
bottom
of
her
little
mind
aunt
frances
down
in
the
bottom
of
her
own
mind
thought
that
her
mother
had
never
really
understood
her
and
she
meant
to
do
better
by
elizabeth
ann
she
also
loved
the
little
girl
with
all
her
heart
and
longed
above
everything
in
the
world
to
protect
her
from
all
harm
and
to
keep
her
happy
and
strong
and
well
and
yet
elizabeth
ann
was
neither
very
strong
nor
well
and
as
to
her
being
happy
you
can
judge
for
yourself
when
you
have
read
all
this
story
she
was
very
small
for
her
age
with
a
rather
pale
face
and
big
dark
eyes
which
had
in
them
a
frightened
wistful
expression
that
went
to
aunt
frances
tender
heart
and
made
her
ache
to
take
care
of
elizabeth
ann
better
and
better
aunt
frances
was
afraid
of
a
great
many
things
herself
and
she
knew
how
to
sympathize
with
timidity
she
was
always
quick
to
reassure
the
little
girl
with
all
her
might
and
main
whenever
there
was
anything
to
fear
when
they
were
out
walking
aunt
frances
took
her
out
for
a
walk
up
one
block
and
down
another
every
single
day
no
matter
how
tired
the
music
lessons
had
made
her
the
aunt
eyes
were
always
on
the
alert
to
avoid
anything
which
might
frighten
elizabeth
ann
if
a
big
dog
trotted
by
aunt
frances
always
said
hastily
there
there
dear
that
a
nice
doggie
i
sure
i
do
believe
he
ever
bites
little
girls
mercy
elizabeth
ann
do
go
near
him
here
darling
just
get
on
the
other
side
of
aunt
frances
if
he
scares
you
so
by
that
time
elizabeth
ann
was
always
pretty
well
scared
and
perhaps
we
better
just
turn
this
corner
and
walk
in
the
other
direction
if
by
any
chance
the
dog
went
in
that
direction
too
aunt
frances
became
a
prodigy
of
valiant
protection
putting
the
shivering
little
girl
behind
her
threatening
the
animal
with
her
umbrella
and
saying
in
a
trembling
voice
go
away
sir
go
away
or
if
it
thundered
and
lightened
aunt
frances
always
dropped
everything
she
might
be
doing
and
held
elizabeth
ann
tightly
in
her
arms
until
it
was
all
over
and
at
night
elizabeth
ann
did
not
sleep
very
well
when
the
little
girl
woke
up
screaming
with
a
bad
dream
it
was
always
dear
aunt
frances
who
came
to
her
bedside
a
warm
wrapper
over
her
nightgown
so
that
she
need
not
hurry
back
to
her
own
room
a
candle
lighting
up
her
tired
kind
face
she
always
took
the
little
girl
into
her
thin
arms
and
held
her
close
against
her
thin
breast
tell
aunt
frances
all
about
your
naughty
dream
darling
she
would
murmur
so
to
get
it
off
your
mind
she
had
read
in
her
books
that
you
can
tell
a
great
deal
about
children
inner
lives
by
analyzing
their
dreams
and
besides
if
she
did
not
urge
elizabeth
ann
to
tell
it
she
was
afraid
the
sensitive
nervous
little
thing
would
lie
awake
and
brood
over
it
this
was
the
phrase
she
always
used
the
next
day
to
her
mother
when
aunt
harriet
exclaimed
about
her
paleness
and
the
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
so
she
listened
patiently
while
the
little
girl
told
her
all
about
the
fearful
dreams
she
had
the
great
dogs
with
huge
red
mouths
that
ran
after
her
the
indians
who
scalped
her
her
schoolhouse
on
fire
so
that
she
had
to
jump
from
a
window
and
was
all
broken
to
bits
once
in
a
while
elizabeth
ann
got
so
interested
in
all
this
that
she
went
on
and
made
up
more
awful
things
even
than
she
had
dreamed
and
told
long
stories
which
showed
her
to
be
a
child
of
great
imagination
but
all
these
dreams
and
continuations
of
dreams
aunt
frances
wrote
down
the
first
thing
the
next
morning
and
with
frequent
references
to
a
thick
book
full
of
hard
words
she
tried
her
best
to
puzzle
out
from
them
exactly
what
kind
of
little
girl
elizabeth
ann
really
was
there
was
one
dream
however
that
even
conscientious
aunt
frances
never
tried
to
analyze
because
it
was
too
sad
elizabeth
ann
dreamed
sometimes
that
she
was
dead
and
lay
in
a
little
white
coffin
with
white
roses
over
her
oh
that
made
aunt
frances
cry
and
so
did
elizabeth
ann
it
was
very
touching
then
after
a
long
long
time
of
talk
and
tears
and
sobs
and
hugs
the
little
girl
would
begin
to
get
drowsy
and
aunt
frances
would
rock
her
to
sleep
in
her
arms
and
lay
her
down
ever
so
quietly
and
slip
away
to
try
to
get
a
little
nap
herself
before
it
was
time
to
get
up
at
a
quarter
of
nine
every
weekday
morning
aunt
frances
dropped
whatever
else
she
was
doing
took
elizabeth
ann
little
thin
white
hand
protectingly
in
hers
and
led
her
through
the
busy
streets
to
the
big
brick
where
the
little
girl
had
always
gone
to
school
it
was
four
stories
high
and
when
all
the
classes
were
in
session
there
were
six
hundred
children
under
that
one
roof
you
can
imagine
perhaps
the
noise
there
was
on
the
playground
just
before
school
elizabeth
ann
shrank
from
it
with
all
her
soul
and
clung
more
tightly
than
ever
to
aunt
frances
hand
as
she
was
led
along
through
the
crowded
shrieking
masses
of
children
oh
how
glad
she
was
that
she
had
aunt
frances
there
to
take
care
of
her
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
noticed
the
little
thin
girl
at
all
and
her
very
own
classmates
would
hardly
have
known
whether
she
came
to
school
or
not
aunt
frances
took
her
safely
through
the
ordeal
of
the
playground
then
up
the
long
broad
stairs
and
pigeonholed
her
carefully
in
her
own
schoolroom
she
was
in
the
third
grade
you
understand
which
is
almost
the
fourth
then
at
noon
aunt
frances
was
waiting
there
a
patient
figure
to
walk
home
with
her
little
charge
and
in
the
afternoon
the
same
thing
happened
over
again
on
the
way
to
and
from
school
they
talked
about
what
had
happened
in
the
class
aunt
frances
believed
in
sympathizing
with
a
child
life
so
she
always
asked
about
every
little
thing
and
remembered
to
inquire
about
the
continuation
of
every
episode
and
sympathized
with
all
her
heart
over
the
failure
in
mental
arithmetic
and
triumphed
over
elizabeth
ann
beating
the
schmidt
girl
in
spelling
and
was
indignant
over
the
teacher
having
pets
sometimes
in
telling
over
some
very
dreadful
failure
or
disappointment
elizabeth
ann
would
get
so
wrought
up
that
she
would
cry
this
always
brought
the
ready
tears
to
aunt
frances
kind
eyes
and
with
many
soothing
words
and
nervous
tremulous
caresses
she
tried
to
make
life
easier
for
poor
little
elizabeth
ann
the
days
when
they
had
cried
they
could
neither
of
them
eat
much
luncheon
after
school
and
on
saturdays
there
was
always
the
daily
walk
and
there
were
lessons
all
kinds
of
lessons
of
course
and
lessons
out
of
an
excellent
book
aunt
frances
had
bought
and
painting
lessons
and
sewing
lessons
and
even
a
little
french
although
aunt
frances
was
not
very
sure
about
her
own
pronunciation
she
wanted
to
give
the
little
girl
every
possible
advantage
you
see
they
were
really
inseparable
elizabeth
ann
once
said
to
some
ladies
calling
on
her
aunts
that
whenever
anything
happened
in
school
the
first
thing
she
thought
of
was
what
aunt
frances
would
think
of
it
why
is
that
they
asked
looking
at
aunt
frances
who
was
blushing
with
pleasure
oh
she
is
so
interested
in
my
school
work
and
she
understands
me
said
elizabeth
ann
repeating
the
phrases
she
had
heard
so
often
aunt
frances
eyes
filled
with
happy
tears
she
called
elizabeth
ann
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
gave
her
as
big
a
hug
as
her
thin
arms
could
manage
elizabeth
ann
was
growing
tall
very
fast
one
of
the
visiting
ladies
said
that
before
long
she
would
be
as
big
as
her
auntie
and
a
troublesome
young
lady
aunt
frances
said
i
have
had
her
from
the
time
she
was
a
little
baby
and
there
has
scarcely
been
an
hour
she
has
been
out
of
my
sight
i
always
have
her
confidence
you
always
tell
aunt
frances
everything
wo
you
darling
elizabeth
ann
resolved
to
do
this
always
even
if
as
now
she
often
had
to
invent
things
to
tell
aunt
frances
went
on
to
the
callers
but
i
do
wish
she
were
so
thin
and
pale
and
nervous
i
suppose
it
is
the
exciting
modern
life
that
is
so
bad
for
children
i
try
to
see
that
she
has
plenty
of
fresh
air
i
go
out
with
her
for
a
walk
every
single
day
but
we
have
taken
all
the
walks
around
here
so
often
that
we
rather
tired
of
them
it
often
hard
to
know
how
to
get
her
out
enough
i
think
i
have
to
get
the
doctor
to
come
and
see
her
and
perhaps
give
her
a
tonic
to
elizabeth
ann
she
added
hastily
now
do
go
getting
notions
in
your
head
darling
aunt
frances
does
think
there
anything
very
much
the
matter
with
you
you
be
all
right
again
soon
if
you
just
take
the
doctor
medicine
nicely
aunt
frances
will
take
care
of
her
precious
little
girl
she
make
the
bad
sickness
go
away
elizabeth
ann
who
had
not
known
before
that
she
was
sick
had
a
picture
of
herself
lying
in
the
little
white
coffin
all
covered
over
with
white
in
a
few
minutes
aunt
frances
was
obliged
to
excuse
herself
from
her
callers
and
devote
herself
entirely
to
taking
care
of
elizabeth
ann
so
one
day
after
this
had
happened
several
times
aunt
frances
really
did
send
for
the
doctor
who
came
briskly
in
just
as
elizabeth
ann
had
always
seen
him
with
his
little
square
black
bag
smelling
of
leather
his
sharp
eyes
and
the
air
of
bored
impatience
which
he
always
wore
in
that
house
elizabeth
ann
was
terribly
afraid
to
see
him
for
she
felt
in
her
bones
he
would
say
she
had
galloping
consumption
and
would
die
before
the
leaves
cast
a
shadow
this
was
a
phrase
she
had
picked
up
from
grace
whose
conversation
perhaps
on
account
of
her
asthma
was
full
of
references
to
early
graves
and
quick
declines
and
yet
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
case
before
although
elizabeth
ann
when
she
first
stood
up
before
the
doctor
had
been
quaking
with
fear
lest
he
discover
some
deadly
disease
in
her
she
was
very
much
hurt
indeed
when
after
thumping
her
and
looking
at
her
lower
eyelid
inside
out
and
listening
to
her
breathing
he
pushed
her
away
with
a
little
jerk
and
said
there
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
with
that
child
she
as
sound
as
a
nut
what
she
needs
is
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
aunt
frances
thin
anxious
face
with
the
eyebrows
drawn
together
in
a
knot
of
conscientiousness
and
then
he
looked
at
aunt
thin
anxious
face
with
the
eyebrows
drawn
up
that
very
same
way
and
then
he
glanced
at
grace
thin
anxious
face
peering
from
the
door
waiting
for
his
verdict
and
then
he
drew
a
long
breath
shut
his
lips
and
his
little
black
case
very
tightly
and
did
not
go
on
to
say
what
it
was
that
elizabeth
ann
needed
of
course
aunt
frances
did
let
him
off
as
easily
as
that
you
may
be
sure
she
fluttered
around
him
as
he
tried
to
go
and
she
said
all
sorts
of
fluttery
things
to
him
like
but
doctor
she
has
gained
a
pound
in
three
months
and
her
sleep
and
her
appetite
and
her
nerves
illustration
elizabeth
ann
stood
up
before
the
doctor
the
doctor
said
back
to
her
as
he
put
on
his
hat
all
the
things
doctors
always
say
under
such
conditions
more
beefsteak
plenty
of
fresh
air
more
sleep
she
be
all
right
but
his
voice
did
not
sound
as
though
he
thought
what
he
was
saying
amounted
to
much
nor
did
elizabeth
ann
she
had
hoped
for
some
spectacular
red
pills
to
be
taken
every
like
those
grace
doctor
gave
her
whenever
she
felt
low
in
her
mind
and
just
then
something
happened
which
changed
elizabeth
ann
life
forever
and
ever
it
was
a
very
small
thing
too
aunt
harriet
coughed
elizabeth
ann
did
not
think
it
at
all
a
cough
in
comparison
with
grace
hollow
whoop
aunt
harriet
had
been
coughing
like
that
ever
since
the
cold
weather
set
in
for
three
or
four
months
now
and
nobody
had
thought
anything
of
it
because
they
were
all
so
much
occupied
in
taking
care
of
the
sensitive
nervous
little
girl
who
needed
so
much
care
and
yet
at
the
sound
of
that
little
discreet
cough
behind
aunt
harriet
hand
the
doctor
whirled
around
and
fixed
his
sharp
eyes
on
her
with
all
the
bored
impatient
look
gone
the
first
time
elizabeth
ann
had
ever
seen
him
look
interested
what
that
what
that
he
said
going
over
quickly
to
aunt
harriet
he
snatched
out
of
his
little
bag
a
shiny
thing
with
two
rubber
tubes
attached
and
he
put
the
ends
of
the
tubes
in
his
ears
and
the
shiny
thing
up
against
aunt
harriet
who
was
saying
it
nothing
doctor
a
little
teasing
cough
i
had
this
winter
and
i
meant
to
tell
you
too
but
i
forgot
it
that
that
sore
spot
on
my
lungs
does
go
away
as
it
ought
to
the
doctor
motioned
her
very
impolitely
to
stop
talking
and
listened
very
hard
through
his
little
tubes
then
he
turned
around
and
looked
at
aunt
frances
as
though
he
were
angry
at
her
he
said
take
the
child
away
and
then
come
back
here
yourself
and
that
was
almost
all
that
elizabeth
ann
ever
knew
of
the
forces
which
swept
her
away
from
the
life
which
had
always
gone
on
revolving
about
her
small
person
exactly
the
same
ever
since
she
could
remember
you
have
heard
so
much
about
tears
in
the
account
of
elizabeth
life
so
far
that
i
wo
tell
you
much
about
the
few
days
which
followed
as
the
family
talked
over
and
hurriedly
prepared
to
obey
the
doctor
verdict
which
was
that
aunt
harriet
was
very
very
sick
and
must
go
away
at
once
to
a
warm
climate
and
aunt
frances
must
go
too
but
not
elizabeth
ann
for
aunt
frances
would
need
to
give
all
her
time
to
taking
care
of
aunt
harriet
and
anyhow
the
doctor
did
think
it
best
either
for
aunt
harriet
or
for
elizabeth
ann
to
have
them
in
the
same
house
grace
could
go
of
course
but
to
everybody
surprise
she
said
she
did
mind
because
she
had
a
bachelor
brother
who
kept
a
grocery
store
who
had
been
wanting
her
for
years
to
go
and
keep
house
for
him
she
said
she
had
stayed
on
just
out
of
conscientiousness
because
she
knew
aunt
harriet
could
get
along
without
her
and
if
you
notice
that
the
way
things
often
happen
to
very
very
conscientious
people
elizabeth
ann
however
had
no
grocer
brother
she
had
it
is
true
a
great
many
relatives
and
of
course
it
was
settled
she
should
go
to
some
of
them
till
aunt
frances
could
take
her
back
for
the
time
being
just
now
while
everything
was
so
distracted
and
confused
she
was
to
go
to
stay
with
the
lathrop
cousins
who
lived
in
the
same
city
although
it
was
very
evident
that
the
lathrops
were
not
perfectly
crazy
with
delight
over
the
prospect
still
something
had
to
be
done
at
once
and
aunt
frances
was
so
frantic
with
the
packing
up
and
the
moving
men
coming
to
take
the
furniture
to
storage
and
her
anxiety
over
her
mother
she
had
switched
to
aunt
harriet
you
see
all
the
conscientiousness
she
had
lavished
on
elizabeth
ann
nothing
much
could
be
extracted
from
her
about
elizabeth
ann
just
keep
her
for
the
present
molly
she
said
to
cousin
molly
lathrop
i
do
something
soon
i
write
you
i
make
another
arrangement
but
just
now
her
voice
was
quavering
on
the
edge
of
tears
and
cousin
molly
lathrop
who
hated
scenes
said
hastily
yes
oh
yes
of
course
for
the
present
and
went
away
thinking
that
she
did
see
why
she
should
have
all
the
disagreeable
things
to
do
when
she
had
her
tyrannical
old
mother
to
take
care
of
was
that
enough
without
adding
to
the
household
such
a
nervous
spoiled
morbid
young
one
as
elizabeth
ann
elizabeth
ann
did
not
of
course
for
a
moment
dream
that
cousin
molly
was
thinking
any
such
things
about
her
but
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
cousin
molly
was
not
any
too
enthusiastic
about
taking
her
in
and
she
was
already
feeling
terribly
forlorn
about
the
sudden
unexpected
change
in
aunt
frances
who
had
been
so
wrapped
up
in
her
and
now
was
just
as
much
wrapped
up
in
aunt
harriet
do
you
know
i
am
sorry
for
elizabeth
ann
and
what
more
i
have
been
ever
since
this
story
began
well
since
i
promised
you
that
i
was
not
going
to
tell
about
more
tears
i
wo
say
a
single
word
about
the
day
when
the
two
aunts
went
away
on
the
train
for
there
is
nothing
much
but
tears
to
tell
about
except
perhaps
an
absent
look
in
aunt
frances
eyes
which
hurt
the
little
girl
feelings
dreadfully
and
then
cousin
molly
took
the
hand
of
the
sobbing
little
girl
and
led
her
back
to
the
lathrop
house
but
if
you
think
you
are
now
going
to
hear
about
the
lathrops
you
are
quite
mistaken
for
just
at
this
moment
old
lathrop
took
a
hand
in
the
matter
she
was
cousin
husband
mother
and
of
course
no
relation
at
all
to
elizabeth
ann
and
so
was
less
enthusiastic
than
anybody
else
all
that
elizabeth
ann
ever
saw
of
this
old
lady
who
now
turned
the
current
of
her
life
again
was
her
head
sticking
out
of
a
window
and
that
all
that
you
need
to
know
about
her
either
it
was
a
very
much
agitated
old
head
and
it
bobbed
and
shook
with
the
intensity
with
which
the
imperative
old
voice
called
upon
cousin
molly
and
elizabeth
ann
to
stop
right
there
where
they
were
on
the
front
walk
the
doctor
says
that
what
the
matter
with
bridget
is
scarlet
fever
and
we
all
got
to
be
quarantined
there
no
earthly
sense
bringing
that
child
in
to
be
sick
and
have
it
and
be
nursed
and
make
the
quarantine
twice
as
long
but
mother
called
cousin
molly
i
ca
leave
the
child
in
the
middle
of
the
street
elizabeth
ann
was
actually
glad
to
hear
her
say
that
because
she
was
feeling
so
awfully
unwanted
which
is
if
you
think
of
it
not
a
very
cheerful
feeling
for
a
little
girl
who
has
been
the
hub
round
which
a
whole
household
was
revolving
you
do
have
to
shouted
old
lathrop
out
of
her
window
although
she
did
not
add
you
gump
aloud
you
could
feel
she
was
meaning
just
that
you
do
have
to
you
can
just
send
her
to
the
putney
cousins
all
nonsense
about
her
not
going
there
in
the
first
place
they
invited
her
the
minute
they
heard
of
harriet
being
so
bad
they
the
natural
ones
to
take
her
in
abigail
is
her
mother
own
aunt
and
ann
is
her
own
just
as
close
as
harriet
and
frances
are
and
much
closer
than
you
and
on
a
farm
and
all
just
the
place
for
her
but
how
under
the
sun
mother
shouted
cousin
molly
back
can
i
get
her
to
the
putneys
you
ca
send
a
child
of
nine
a
thousand
miles
without
old
lathrop
looked
again
as
though
she
were
saying
you
gump
and
said
aloud
why
there
james
going
to
new
york
on
business
in
a
few
days
anyhow
he
can
just
go
now
and
take
her
along
and
put
her
on
the
right
train
at
albany
if
he
wires
from
here
they
meet
her
in
hillsboro
and
that
was
just
what
happened
perhaps
you
may
have
guessed
by
this
time
that
when
old
lathrop
issued
orders
they
were
usually
obeyed
as
to
who
the
bridget
was
who
had
the
scarlet
fever
i
know
no
more
than
you
i
take
it
from
the
name
she
was
the
cook
unless
indeed
old
lathrop
made
her
up
for
the
occasion
which
i
think
she
would
have
been
quite
capable
of
doing
do
you
at
any
rate
with
no
more
ifs
or
ands
elizabeth
ann
satchel
was
packed
and
cousin
james
lathrop
satchel
was
packed
and
the
two
set
off
together
the
big
portly
man
quite
as
much
afraid
of
his
mother
as
elizabeth
ann
was
but
he
was
going
to
new
york
and
it
is
conceivable
that
he
thought
once
or
twice
on
the
trip
that
there
were
good
times
in
new
york
as
well
as
business
engagements
whereas
poor
elizabeth
ann
was
being
sent
straight
to
the
one
place
in
the
world
where
there
were
no
good
times
at
all
aunt
harriet
had
said
so
ever
so
many
times
poor
elizabeth
ann
chapter
ii
betsy
holds
the
reins
you
can
imagine
perhaps
the
dreadful
terror
of
elizabeth
ann
as
the
train
carried
her
along
toward
vermont
and
the
horrible
putney
farm
it
had
happened
so
quickly
her
satchel
packed
the
telegram
sent
the
train
caught
that
she
had
not
had
time
to
get
her
wits
together
assert
herself
and
say
that
she
would
not
go
there
besides
she
had
a
sinking
notion
that
perhaps
they
would
pay
any
attention
to
her
if
she
did
the
world
had
come
to
an
end
now
that
aunt
frances
was
there
to
take
care
of
her
even
in
the
most
familiar
air
she
could
only
half
breathe
without
aunt
frances
and
now
she
was
not
even
being
taken
to
the
putney
farm
she
was
being
sent
she
shrank
together
in
her
seat
more
and
more
frightened
as
the
end
of
her
journey
came
nearer
and
looked
out
dismally
at
the
winter
landscape
thinking
it
hideous
with
its
brown
bare
fields
its
brown
bare
trees
and
the
little
streams
hurrying
along
swollen
with
the
january
thaw
which
had
taken
all
the
snow
from
the
hills
she
had
heard
her
elders
say
about
her
so
many
times
that
she
could
not
stand
the
cold
that
she
shivered
at
the
very
thought
of
cold
weather
and
certainly
nothing
could
look
colder
than
that
bleak
country
into
which
the
train
was
now
slowly
making
its
way
the
engine
puffed
and
puffed
with
great
laboring
breaths
that
shook
elizabeth
ann
diaphragm
up
and
down
but
the
train
moved
more
and
more
slowly
elizabeth
ann
could
feel
under
her
feet
how
the
floor
of
the
car
was
tipped
up
as
it
crept
along
the
steep
incline
pretty
stiff
grade
here
said
a
passenger
to
the
conductor
you
bet
he
assented
but
hillsboro
is
the
next
station
and
that
at
the
top
of
the
hill
we
go
down
after
that
to
rutland
he
turned
to
elizabeth
ann
say
little
girl
did
your
uncle
say
you
were
to
get
off
at
hillsboro
you
better
be
getting
your
things
together
poor
elizabeth
ann
knees
knocked
against
each
other
with
fear
of
the
strange
faces
she
was
to
encounter
and
when
the
conductor
came
to
help
her
get
off
he
had
to
carry
the
white
trembling
child
as
well
as
her
satchel
but
there
was
only
one
strange
face
there
not
another
soul
in
sight
at
the
little
wooden
station
a
old
man
in
a
fur
cap
and
heavy
coat
stood
by
a
lumber
wagon
this
is
her
putney
said
the
conductor
touching
his
cap
and
went
back
to
the
train
which
went
away
shrieking
for
a
nearby
crossing
and
setting
the
echoes
ringing
from
one
mountain
to
another
there
was
elizabeth
ann
alone
with
her
henry
he
nodded
to
her
and
drew
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
a
warm
large
cape
which
he
slipped
over
her
shoulders
the
women
folks
were
afraid
you
git
cold
drivin
he
explained
he
then
lifted
her
high
to
the
seat
tossed
her
satchel
into
the
wagon
climbed
up
himself
and
clucked
to
his
horses
elizabeth
ann
had
always
before
thought
it
an
essential
part
of
railway
journeys
to
be
much
kissed
at
the
end
and
asked
a
great
many
times
how
you
had
stood
the
trip
she
sat
very
still
on
the
high
lumber
seat
feeling
very
forlorn
and
neglected
her
feet
dangled
high
above
the
floor
of
the
wagon
she
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
most
dangerous
place
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
in
her
worst
dreams
oh
why
was
aunt
frances
there
to
take
care
of
her
it
was
just
like
one
of
her
bad
dreams
yes
it
was
horrible
she
would
fall
she
would
roll
under
the
wheels
and
be
crushed
to
she
looked
up
at
uncle
henry
with
the
wild
strained
eyes
of
nervous
terror
which
always
brought
aunt
frances
to
her
in
a
rush
to
hear
all
about
it
to
sympathize
to
reassure
uncle
henry
looked
down
at
her
soberly
his
hard
old
face
quite
unmoved
here
you
drive
will
you
for
a
piece
he
said
briefly
putting
the
reins
into
her
hands
hooking
his
spectacles
over
his
ears
and
drawing
out
a
stubby
pencil
and
a
bit
of
paper
i
got
some
figgering
to
do
you
pull
on
the
rein
to
make
go
to
the
left
and
way
for
way
though
likely
meet
any
teams
elizabeth
ann
had
been
so
near
one
of
her
wild
screams
of
terror
that
now
in
spite
of
her
instant
absorbed
interest
in
the
reins
she
gave
a
queer
little
yelp
she
was
all
ready
with
the
explanation
her
conversations
with
aunt
frances
having
made
her
very
fluent
in
explanations
of
her
own
emotions
she
would
tell
uncle
henry
about
how
scared
she
had
been
and
how
she
had
just
been
about
to
scream
and
could
keep
back
that
one
little
but
uncle
henry
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
little
howl
or
if
he
had
did
think
it
worth
conversation
for
he
oh
the
horses
were
certainly
going
to
one
side
she
hastily
decided
which
was
her
right
hand
she
had
never
been
forced
to
know
it
so
quickly
before
and
pulled
furiously
on
that
rein
the
horses
turned
their
hanging
heads
a
little
and
miraculously
there
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
road
again
elizabeth
ann
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
pride
and
looked
to
uncle
henry
for
praise
but
he
was
busily
setting
down
figures
as
though
he
were
getting
his
lesson
for
the
next
day
and
had
not
noticed
oh
there
they
were
going
to
the
left
again
this
time
in
her
flurry
she
made
a
mistake
about
which
hand
was
which
and
pulled
wildly
on
the
left
line
the
horses
docilely
walked
off
the
road
into
a
shallow
ditch
the
wagon
tilted
help
why
did
uncle
henry
help
uncle
henry
continued
intently
figuring
on
the
back
of
his
envelope
elizabeth
ann
the
perspiration
starting
out
on
her
forehead
pulled
on
the
other
line
the
horses
turned
back
up
the
little
slope
the
wheel
grated
sickeningly
against
the
wagonbox
she
was
sure
they
would
tip
over
but
there
somehow
there
they
were
in
the
road
safe
and
sound
with
uncle
henry
adding
up
a
column
of
figures
if
he
only
knew
thought
the
little
girl
if
he
only
knew
the
danger
he
had
been
in
and
how
he
had
been
saved
but
she
must
think
of
some
way
to
remember
for
sure
which
her
right
hand
was
and
avoid
that
hideous
mistake
again
and
then
suddenly
something
inside
elizabeth
ann
head
stirred
and
moved
it
came
to
her
like
a
clap
that
she
need
know
which
was
right
or
left
at
all
if
she
just
pulled
the
way
she
wanted
them
to
go
the
horses
would
never
know
whether
it
was
the
right
or
the
left
rein
it
is
possible
that
what
stirred
inside
her
head
at
that
moment
was
her
brain
waking
up
she
was
nine
years
old
and
she
was
in
the
third
a
grade
at
school
but
that
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
had
a
whole
thought
of
her
very
own
at
home
aunt
frances
had
always
known
exactly
what
she
was
doing
and
had
helped
her
over
the
hard
places
before
she
even
knew
they
were
there
and
at
school
her
teachers
had
been
carefully
trained
to
think
faster
than
the
scholars
somebody
had
always
been
explaining
things
to
elizabeth
ann
so
industriously
that
she
had
never
found
out
a
single
thing
for
herself
before
this
was
a
very
small
discovery
but
an
original
one
elizabeth
ann
was
as
excited
about
it
as
a
over
the
first
egg
that
hatches
she
forgot
how
afraid
she
was
of
uncle
henry
and
poured
out
to
him
her
discovery
it
not
right
or
left
that
matters
she
ended
triumphantly
it
which
way
you
want
to
go
uncle
henry
looked
at
her
attentively
as
she
talked
eyeing
her
sidewise
over
the
top
of
one
when
she
finished
well
now
that
so
he
admitted
and
returned
to
his
arithmetic
it
was
a
short
remark
shorter
than
any
elizabeth
ann
had
ever
heard
before
aunt
frances
and
her
teachers
always
explained
matters
at
length
but
it
had
a
weighty
satisfying
ring
to
it
the
little
girl
felt
the
importance
of
having
her
statement
recognized
she
turned
back
to
her
driving
the
slow
heavy
plow
horses
had
stopped
during
her
talk
with
uncle
henry
they
stood
as
still
now
as
though
their
feet
had
grown
to
the
road
elizabeth
ann
looked
up
at
the
old
man
for
instructions
but
he
was
deep
in
his
figures
she
had
been
taught
never
to
interrupt
people
so
she
sat
still
and
waited
for
him
to
tell
her
what
to
do
but
although
they
were
driving
in
the
midst
of
a
winter
thaw
it
was
a
pretty
cold
day
with
an
icy
wind
blowing
down
the
back
of
her
neck
the
early
winter
twilight
was
beginning
to
fall
and
she
felt
rather
empty
she
grew
very
tired
of
waiting
and
remembered
how
the
grocer
boy
at
home
had
started
his
horse
then
summoning
all
her
courage
with
an
apprehensive
glance
at
uncle
henry
arithmetical
silence
she
slapped
the
reins
up
and
down
on
the
horses
backs
and
made
the
best
imitation
she
could
of
the
grocer
boy
cluck
the
horses
lifted
their
heads
they
leaned
forward
they
put
one
foot
before
the
other
they
were
off
the
color
rose
hot
on
elizabeth
ann
happy
face
if
she
had
started
a
big
red
automobile
she
would
not
have
been
prouder
for
it
was
the
first
thing
she
had
ever
done
all
herself
every
bit
every
smitch
she
had
thought
of
it
and
she
had
done
it
and
it
had
worked
now
for
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
long
time
she
drove
drove
so
hard
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
she
guided
the
horses
around
stones
she
cheered
them
through
freezing
of
melted
snow
she
kept
them
in
the
anxiously
exact
middle
of
the
road
she
was
quite
astonished
when
uncle
henry
put
his
pencil
and
paper
away
took
the
reins
from
her
hands
and
drove
into
a
yard
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
little
low
white
house
and
on
the
other
a
big
red
barn
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
she
guessed
that
this
was
putney
farm
two
women
in
gingham
dresses
and
white
aprons
came
out
of
the
house
one
was
old
and
one
might
be
called
young
just
like
aunt
harriet
and
aunt
frances
but
they
looked
very
different
from
those
aunts
the
one
was
very
tall
and
and
the
one
was
very
rosy
and
fat
they
both
looked
up
at
the
little
thin
girl
on
the
high
seat
and
smiled
well
father
you
got
her
i
see
said
the
one
she
stepped
up
to
the
wagon
and
held
up
her
arms
to
the
child
come
on
betsy
and
get
some
supper
she
said
as
though
elizabeth
ann
had
lived
there
all
her
life
and
had
just
driven
into
town
and
back
and
that
was
the
arrival
of
elizabeth
ann
at
putney
farm
the
one
took
a
long
strong
step
or
two
and
swung
her
up
on
the
porch
you
take
her
in
mother
she
said
i
help
father
unhitch
the
fat
rosy
one
took
elizabeth
ann
skinny
cold
little
hand
in
her
soft
warm
fat
one
and
led
her
along
to
the
open
kitchen
door
i
your
aunt
abigail
she
said
your
mother
aunt
you
know
and
that
your
cousin
ann
that
lifted
you
down
and
it
was
your
uncle
henry
that
brought
you
out
from
town
she
shut
the
door
and
went
on
i
do
know
if
your
aunt
harriet
ever
happened
to
tell
you
about
us
and
so
elizabeth
ann
interrupted
her
hastily
the
recollection
of
all
aunt
harriet
remarks
vividly
before
her
oh
yes
oh
yes
she
said
she
always
talked
about
you
she
talked
about
you
a
lot
she
the
little
girl
stopped
short
and
bit
her
lip
if
aunt
abigail
guessed
from
the
expression
on
elizabeth
ann
face
what
kind
of
talking
aunt
harriet
had
been
she
showed
it
only
by
a
deepening
of
the
wrinkles
all
around
her
eyes
she
said
gravely
well
that
a
good
thing
you
know
all
about
us
then
she
turned
to
the
stove
and
took
out
of
the
oven
a
pan
of
hot
baked
beans
very
brown
and
crispy
on
top
elizabeth
ann
detested
beans
and
said
over
her
shoulder
take
your
things
off
betsy
and
hang
on
that
lowest
hook
back
of
the
door
that
your
hook
the
little
girl
fumbled
forlornly
with
the
fastenings
of
her
cape
and
the
buttons
of
her
coat
at
home
aunt
frances
or
grace
had
always
taken
off
her
wraps
and
put
them
away
for
her
when
very
sorry
for
herself
she
turned
away
from
the
hook
aunt
abigail
said
now
you
must
be
cold
pull
a
chair
right
up
here
by
the
stove
she
was
stepping
around
quickly
as
she
put
supper
on
the
table
the
floor
shook
under
her
she
was
one
of
the
fattest
people
elizabeth
ann
had
ever
seen
after
living
with
aunt
frances
and
aunt
harriet
and
grace
the
little
girl
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
she
stared
and
stared
aunt
abigail
seemed
not
to
notice
this
indeed
she
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
newcomer
elizabeth
ann
sat
on
the
wooden
chair
her
feet
hanging
she
had
been
taught
that
it
was
not
manners
to
put
her
feet
on
the
rungs
looking
about
her
with
miserable
homesick
eyes
what
an
ugly
room
with
only
a
couple
of
horrid
kerosene
lamps
for
light
and
they
did
keep
any
girl
evidently
and
they
were
going
to
eat
right
in
the
kitchen
like
poor
people
and
nobody
spoke
to
her
or
looked
at
her
or
asked
her
how
she
had
stood
the
trip
and
here
she
was
millions
of
miles
away
from
aunt
frances
without
anybody
to
take
care
of
her
she
began
to
feel
the
tight
place
in
her
throat
which
by
thinking
about
hard
she
could
always
turn
into
tears
and
presently
her
eyes
began
to
water
aunt
abigail
was
not
looking
at
her
at
all
but
she
now
stopped
short
in
one
of
her
rushes
to
the
table
set
down
the
she
was
carrying
and
said
there
as
though
she
had
forgotten
something
she
stooped
it
was
perfectly
amazing
how
spry
she
was
and
pulled
out
from
under
the
stove
a
kitten
very
sleepy
yawning
and
stretching
and
blinking
its
eyes
there
betsy
said
aunt
abigail
putting
the
little
yellow
and
white
ball
into
the
child
lap
there
is
one
of
old
whitey
kittens
that
did
get
given
away
last
summer
and
she
pesters
the
life
out
of
me
i
got
so
much
to
do
when
i
heard
you
were
coming
i
thought
maybe
you
would
take
care
of
her
for
me
if
you
want
to
enough
to
bother
to
feed
her
and
all
you
can
have
her
for
your
own
elizabeth
ann
bent
her
thin
face
over
the
warm
furry
friendly
little
animal
she
could
not
speak
she
had
always
wanted
a
kitten
but
aunt
frances
and
aunt
harriet
and
grace
had
always
been
sure
that
cats
brought
diphtheria
and
tonsilitis
and
all
sorts
of
dreadful
diseases
to
delicate
little
girls
she
was
afraid
to
move
for
fear
the
little
thing
would
jump
down
and
run
away
but
as
she
bent
cautiously
toward
it
the
necktie
of
her
middy
blouse
fell
forward
and
the
kitten
in
the
middle
of
a
yawn
struck
swiftly
at
it
with
a
soft
paw
then
still
too
sleepy
to
play
it
turned
its
head
and
began
to
lick
elizabeth
ann
hand
with
a
rough
little
tongue
perhaps
you
can
imagine
how
thrilled
the
little
girl
was
at
this
she
held
her
hand
perfectly
still
until
the
kitten
stopped
and
began
suddenly
washing
its
own
face
and
then
she
put
her
hands
under
it
and
very
awkwardly
lifted
it
up
burying
her
face
in
the
soft
fur
the
kitten
yawned
again
and
from
the
mouth
came
a
fresh
milky
breath
oh
said
elizabeth
ann
under
her
breath
oh
you
darling
the
kitten
looked
at
her
with
bored
speculative
eyes
elizabeth
ann
looked
up
now
at
aunt
abigail
and
said
what
is
its
name
please
but
the
old
woman
was
busy
turning
over
a
griddle
full
of
pancakes
and
did
not
hear
on
the
train
elizabeth
ann
had
resolved
not
to
call
these
hateful
relatives
by
the
same
name
she
had
for
dear
aunt
frances
but
she
now
forgot
that
resolution
and
said
again
oh
aunt
abigail
what
is
its
name
aunt
abigail
faced
her
blankly
name
she
asked
whose
oh
the
kitten
goodness
child
i
stopped
racking
my
brain
for
kitten
names
sixty
years
ago
name
it
yourself
it
yours
elizabeth
ann
had
already
named
it
in
her
own
mind
the
name
she
had
always
thought
she
would
call
a
kitten
by
if
she
ever
had
one
it
was
eleanor
the
prettiest
name
she
knew
aunt
abigail
pushed
a
pitcher
toward
her
there
the
cat
saucer
under
the
sink
do
you
want
to
give
it
some
milk
elizabeth
ann
got
down
from
her
chair
poured
some
milk
into
the
saucer
and
called
here
eleanor
here
eleanor
aunt
abigail
looked
at
her
sharply
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
her
lips
twitched
but
a
moment
later
her
face
was
immovably
grave
as
she
carried
the
last
plate
of
pancakes
to
the
table
elizabeth
ann
sat
on
her
heels
for
a
long
time
watching
the
kitten
lap
the
milk
and
she
was
surprised
when
she
stood
up
to
see
that
cousin
ann
and
uncle
henry
had
come
in
very
from
the
cold
air
well
folks
said
aunt
abigail
do
you
think
we
done
some
lively
stepping
around
betsy
and
i
to
get
supper
all
on
the
table
for
you
elizabeth
ann
stared
what
did
aunt
abigail
mean
she
had
done
a
thing
about
getting
supper
but
nobody
made
any
comment
and
they
all
took
their
seats
and
began
to
eat
elizabeth
ann
was
astonishingly
hungry
and
she
thought
she
could
never
get
enough
of
the
creamed
potatoes
cold
ham
hot
cocoa
and
pancakes
she
was
very
much
relieved
that
her
refusal
of
beans
caused
no
comment
aunt
frances
had
always
tried
very
hard
to
make
her
eat
beans
because
they
have
so
much
protein
in
them
and
growing
children
need
protein
elizabeth
ann
had
heard
this
said
so
many
times
she
could
have
repeated
it
backward
but
it
had
never
made
her
hate
beans
any
the
less
however
nobody
here
seemed
to
know
this
and
elizabeth
ann
kept
her
knowledge
to
herself
they
had
also
evidently
never
heard
how
delicate
her
digestion
was
for
she
never
saw
anything
like
the
number
of
pancakes
they
let
her
eat
all
she
wanted
she
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
they
still
did
not
ask
her
how
she
had
stood
the
trip
they
did
not
indeed
ask
her
much
of
anything
or
pay
very
much
attention
to
her
beyond
filling
her
plate
as
fast
as
she
emptied
it
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
eleanor
came
jumped
into
her
lap
and
curled
down
purring
after
this
elizabeth
ann
kept
one
hand
on
the
little
soft
ball
handling
her
fork
with
the
other
after
supper
well
elizabeth
ann
never
knew
what
did
happen
after
supper
until
she
felt
somebody
lifting
her
and
carrying
her
upstairs
it
was
cousin
ann
who
carried
her
as
lightly
as
though
she
were
a
baby
and
who
said
as
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
a
bedroom
you
went
right
to
sleep
with
your
head
on
the
table
i
guess
pretty
tired
aunt
abigail
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
great
wide
bed
with
four
posts
and
a
curtain
around
the
top
she
was
partly
undressed
and
was
undoing
her
hair
and
brushing
it
out
it
was
very
curly
and
all
fluffed
out
in
a
shining
white
fuzz
around
her
fat
pink
face
full
of
soft
wrinkles
but
in
a
moment
she
was
braiding
it
up
again
and
putting
on
a
tight
white
nightcap
which
she
tied
under
her
chin
we
got
the
word
about
your
coming
so
late
said
cousin
ann
that
we
did
have
time
to
fix
you
up
a
bedroom
that
can
be
warmed
so
going
to
sleep
in
here
for
a
while
the
bed
big
enough
for
two
i
guess
even
if
they
are
as
big
as
you
and
mother
elizabeth
ann
stared
again
what
queer
things
they
said
here
she
nearly
as
big
as
aunt
abigail
mother
did
you
put
shep
out
asked
cousin
ann
and
when
aunt
abigail
said
no
there
i
forgot
to
cousin
ann
went
away
and
that
was
the
last
of
her
they
certainly
believed
in
being
saving
of
their
words
at
putney
farm
elizabeth
ann
began
to
undress
she
was
only
and
that
made
her
feel
only
about
half
her
age
which
was
very
great
the
whole
of
it
and
she
felt
like
just
crooking
her
arm
over
her
eyes
and
giving
up
she
was
too
forlorn
she
had
never
slept
with
anybody
before
and
she
had
heard
ever
so
many
times
how
bad
it
was
for
children
to
sleep
with
an
icy
wind
rattled
the
windows
and
puffed
in
around
the
loose
old
casings
on
the
lay
a
little
wreath
of
snow
elizabeth
ann
shivered
and
shook
on
her
thin
legs
undressed
in
a
hurry
and
slipped
into
her
she
felt
just
as
cold
inside
as
out
and
never
was
more
utterly
miserable
than
in
that
strange
ugly
little
room
with
that
strange
queer
fat
old
woman
she
was
even
too
miserable
to
cry
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
for
elizabeth
ann
she
got
into
bed
first
because
aunt
abigail
said
she
was
going
to
keep
the
candle
lighted
for
a
while
and
read
and
anyhow
she
said
better
sleep
on
the
outside
to
keep
you
from
rolling
out
elizabeth
ann
and
aunt
abigail
lay
very
still
for
a
long
time
aunt
abigail
reading
out
of
a
small
worn
old
book
elizabeth
ann
could
see
its
title
essays
of
emerson
a
book
with
that
name
had
always
laid
on
the
center
table
in
aunt
harriet
house
but
that
copy
was
all
new
and
shiny
and
elizabeth
ann
had
never
seen
anybody
look
inside
it
it
was
a
very
book
with
no
pictures
and
no
conversation
the
little
girl
lay
on
her
back
looking
up
at
the
cracks
in
the
plaster
ceiling
and
watching
the
shadows
sway
and
dance
as
the
candle
flickered
in
the
gusts
of
cold
air
she
herself
began
to
feel
a
soft
pervasive
warmth
aunt
abigail
great
body
was
like
a
stove
it
was
very
very
quiet
quieter
than
any
place
elizabeth
ann
had
ever
known
except
church
because
a
ran
past
aunt
house
and
even
at
night
there
were
always
more
or
less
hangings
and
rattlings
here
there
was
not
a
single
sound
except
the
soft
whispery
noise
when
aunt
abigail
turned
over
a
page
as
she
read
steadily
and
silently
forward
in
her
book
elizabeth
ann
turned
her
head
so
that
she
could
see
the
round
rosy
old
face
full
of
soft
wrinkles
and
the
calm
steady
old
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
page
and
as
she
lay
there
in
the
warm
bed
watching
that
quiet
face
something
very
queer
began
to
happen
to
elizabeth
ann
she
felt
as
though
a
tight
knot
inside
her
were
slowly
being
untied
she
felt
what
was
it
she
felt
there
are
no
words
for
it
from
deep
within
her
something
rose
up
softly
she
drew
one
or
two
long
breaths
illustration
do
you
know
said
aunt
abigail
i
think
it
going
to
be
real
nice
having
a
little
girl
in
the
house
again
aunt
abigail
laid
down
her
book
and
looked
over
at
the
child
do
you
know
she
said
in
a
conversational
tone
do
you
know
i
think
going
to
be
real
nice
having
a
little
girl
in
the
house
again
oh
then
the
tight
knot
in
the
little
unwanted
girl
heart
was
loosened
indeed
it
all
gave
way
at
once
and
elizabeth
ann
burst
suddenly
into
hot
tears
yes
i
know
i
said
i
would
not
tell
you
any
more
about
her
crying
but
these
tears
were
very
different
from
any
she
had
ever
shed
before
and
they
were
the
last
too
for
a
long
long
time
aunt
abigail
said
well
well
and
moving
over
in
bed
took
the
little
weeping
girl
into
her
arms
she
did
not
say
another
word
then
but
she
put
her
soft
withered
old
cheek
close
against
elizabeth
ann
till
the
sobs
began
to
grow
less
and
then
she
said
i
hear
your
kitty
crying
outside
the
door
shall
i
let
her
in
i
expect
she
like
to
sleep
with
you
i
guess
there
room
for
three
of
us
she
got
out
of
bed
as
she
spoke
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
door
the
floor
shook
under
her
great
bulk
and
the
peak
of
her
nightcap
made
a
long
grotesque
shadow
but
as
she
came
back
with
the
kitten
in
her
arms
elizabeth
ann
saw
nothing
funny
in
her
looks
she
gave
eleanor
to
the
little
girl
and
got
into
bed
again
there
now
i
guess
we
ready
for
the
night
she
said
you
put
the
kitty
on
the
other
side
of
you
so
she
wo
fall
out
of
bed
she
blew
the
light
out
and
moved
over
a
little
closer
to
elizabeth
ann
who
immediately
was
enveloped
in
that
delicious
warmth
the
kitten
curled
up
under
the
little
girl
chin
between
her
and
the
terrors
of
the
dark
room
loomed
the
rampart
of
aunt
abigail
great
body
elizabeth
ann
drew
a
long
long
breath
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
sun
was
shining
in
at
the
window
chapter
iii
a
short
morning
aunt
abigail
was
gone
eleanor
was
gone
the
room
was
quite
empty
except
for
the
bright
sunshine
pouring
in
through
the
windows
elizabeth
ann
stretched
and
yawned
and
looked
about
her
what
funny
it
was
so
looking
the
picture
was
of
a
blue
river
and
a
brown
mill
with
green
over
it
and
a
man
with
sacks
on
his
horse
back
stood
in
front
of
the
mill
this
picture
was
repeated
a
great
many
times
all
over
the
paper
and
in
the
corner
where
it
had
come
out
even
they
had
had
to
cut
it
right
down
the
middle
of
the
horse
it
was
very
she
stared
at
it
a
long
time
waiting
for
somebody
to
tell
her
when
to
get
up
at
home
aunt
frances
always
told
her
and
helped
her
get
dressed
but
here
nobody
came
she
discovered
that
the
heat
came
from
a
hole
in
the
floor
near
the
bed
which
opened
down
into
the
room
below
from
it
came
a
warm
breath
of
baking
bread
and
a
muffled
thump
once
in
a
while
the
sun
rose
higher
and
higher
and
elizabeth
ann
grew
hungrier
and
hungrier
finally
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
to
have
somebody
tell
her
to
get
up
she
reached
for
her
clothes
and
began
to
dress
when
she
had
finished
she
went
out
into
the
hall
and
with
a
return
of
her
aggrieved
abandoned
feeling
you
must
remember
that
her
stomach
was
very
empty
she
began
to
try
to
find
her
way
downstairs
she
soon
found
the
steps
went
down
them
one
at
a
time
and
pushed
open
the
door
at
the
foot
cousin
ann
the
one
was
ironing
near
the
stove
she
nodded
and
smiled
as
the
child
came
into
the
room
and
said
well
you
must
feel
rested
oh
i
have
been
asleep
explained
elizabeth
ann
i
was
waiting
for
somebody
to
tell
me
to
get
up
oh
said
cousin
ann
opening
her
black
eyes
a
little
were
you
she
said
no
more
than
this
but
elizabeth
ann
decided
hastily
that
she
would
not
add
as
she
had
been
about
to
that
she
was
also
waiting
for
somebody
to
help
her
dress
and
do
her
hair
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
greatly
enjoyed
doing
her
own
hair
the
first
time
she
had
ever
tried
it
it
had
never
occurred
to
aunt
frances
that
her
little
had
grown
up
enough
to
be
her
own
hairdresser
nor
had
it
occurred
to
elizabeth
ann
that
this
might
be
possible
but
as
she
struggled
with
the
snarls
she
had
had
a
sudden
wild
idea
of
doing
it
a
different
way
from
the
pretty
fashion
aunt
frances
always
followed
elizabeth
ann
had
always
secretly
envied
a
girl
in
her
class
whose
hair
was
all
tied
back
from
her
face
with
one
big
knot
in
her
ribbon
at
the
back
of
her
neck
it
looked
so
and
this
morning
she
had
done
hers
that
way
turning
her
neck
till
it
ached
so
that
she
could
see
the
coveted
tight
effect
at
the
back
and
still
are
little
girls
queer
although
she
had
enjoyed
doing
her
own
hair
she
was
very
much
inclined
to
feel
hurt
because
cousin
ann
had
not
come
to
do
it
for
her
illustration
she
had
greatly
enjoyed
doing
her
own
hair
cousin
ann
set
her
iron
down
with
the
soft
thump
which
elizabeth
ann
had
heard
upstairs
she
began
folding
a
napkin
and
said
now
reach
yourself
a
bowl
off
the
shelf
yonder
the
oatmeal
in
that
kettle
on
the
stove
and
the
milk
is
in
the
blue
pitcher
if
you
want
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
here
a
new
loaf
just
out
of
the
oven
and
the
butter
in
that
brown
crock
elizabeth
ann
followed
these
instructions
and
sat
down
before
this
quickly
assembled
breakfast
in
a
very
much
surprised
silence
at
home
it
took
the
girl
more
than
half
an
hour
to
get
breakfast
and
set
the
table
and
then
she
had
to
wait
on
them
besides
she
began
to
pour
the
milk
out
of
the
pitcher
and
stopped
suddenly
oh
i
afraid
i
taken
more
than
my
share
she
said
apologetically
cousin
ann
looked
up
from
her
rapidly
moving
iron
and
said
in
an
astonished
voice
your
share
what
do
you
mean
my
share
of
the
quart
explained
elizabeth
ann
at
home
they
bought
a
quart
of
milk
and
a
cup
of
cream
every
day
and
they
were
all
very
conscientious
about
not
taking
more
than
their
due
share
good
land
child
take
all
the
milk
you
want
said
cousin
ann
as
though
she
found
something
shocking
in
what
the
little
girl
had
just
said
elizabeth
ann
thought
to
herself
that
she
spoke
as
though
milk
ran
out
of
a
faucet
like
water
she
was
very
fond
of
milk
and
she
made
a
very
good
breakfast
as
she
sat
looking
about
the
room
it
was
unlike
any
room
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
of
course
the
kitchen
and
yet
it
did
seem
possible
that
the
same
word
could
be
applied
to
that
room
and
the
small
dark
which
had
been
grace
asthmatical
kingdom
this
room
was
very
long
and
narrow
and
all
along
one
side
were
windows
with
white
ruffled
curtains
drawn
back
at
the
sides
and
with
small
shining
panes
of
glass
through
which
the
sun
poured
a
golden
flood
of
light
on
a
long
shelf
of
potted
plants
that
took
the
place
of
a
the
shelf
was
covered
with
shining
white
the
pots
were
of
clean
reddish
brown
the
sturdy
stocky
plants
of
bright
green
with
clear
flowers
elizabeth
ann
eyes
wandered
all
over
the
kitchen
from
the
low
white
ceiling
to
the
clean
bare
wooden
floor
but
they
always
came
back
to
those
sunny
windows
once
back
in
the
big
brick
as
she
had
sat
drooping
her
thin
shoulders
over
her
desk
some
sort
of
a
procession
had
gone
by
with
a
brass
band
playing
a
lively
air
for
some
queer
reason
every
time
she
now
glanced
at
that
sheet
of
sunlight
and
the
bright
flowers
she
had
a
little
of
the
same
thrill
which
had
straightened
her
back
and
gone
up
and
down
her
spine
while
the
band
was
playing
possibly
aunt
frances
was
right
after
all
and
elizabeth
ann
was
a
very
impressionable
child
i
wonder
by
the
way
if
anybody
ever
saw
a
child
who
was
at
one
end
the
end
where
cousin
ann
was
ironing
stood
the
kitchen
stove
gleaming
black
with
a
humming
away
on
it
a
big
boiler
near
it
and
a
large
kitchen
cabinet
with
lots
of
drawers
and
shelves
and
hooks
and
things
beyond
that
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
the
table
where
they
had
had
supper
last
night
and
at
which
the
little
girl
now
sat
eating
her
very
late
breakfast
and
beyond
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
another
table
with
an
old
cashmere
shawl
on
it
for
a
cover
a
large
lamp
stood
in
the
middle
of
this
a
bookcase
near
it
two
or
three
around
it
and
back
of
it
against
the
wall
was
a
wide
sofa
covered
with
bright
cretonne
with
three
bright
pillows
something
big
and
black
and
woolly
was
lying
on
this
sofa
snoring
loudly
as
cousin
ann
saw
the
little
girl
fearful
glance
alight
on
this
she
explained
that
step
our
old
dog
does
he
make
an
awful
noise
mother
says
when
she
happens
to
be
alone
here
in
the
evening
it
real
company
to
hear
shep
snore
as
good
as
having
a
man
in
the
house
although
this
did
not
seem
at
all
a
sensible
remark
to
elizabeth
ann
who
thought
soberly
to
herself
that
she
did
see
why
snoring
made
a
dog
as
good
as
a
man
still
she
was
acute
enough
for
she
was
really
quite
an
intelligent
little
girl
to
feel
that
it
belonged
in
the
same
class
of
remarks
as
one
or
two
others
she
had
noted
as
queer
in
the
talk
at
putney
farm
last
night
this
variety
of
talk
was
entirely
new
to
her
nobody
in
aunt
harriet
conscientious
household
ever
making
anything
but
plain
statements
of
fact
it
was
one
of
the
queer
putney
ways
which
aunt
harriet
had
forgotten
to
mention
it
is
possible
that
aunt
harriet
had
never
noticed
it
when
elizabeth
ann
finished
her
breakfast
cousin
ann
made
three
suggestions
using
exactly
the
same
accent
for
them
all
she
said
would
you
better
wash
your
dishes
up
now
before
they
get
sticky
and
do
you
want
one
of
those
red
apples
from
the
dish
on
the
side
table
and
then
maybe
you
like
to
look
around
the
house
so
to
know
where
you
are
elizabeth
ann
had
never
washed
a
dish
in
all
her
life
and
she
had
always
thought
that
nobody
but
poor
ignorant
people
who
afford
to
hire
girls
did
such
things
and
yet
it
was
odd
she
did
not
feel
like
saying
this
to
cousin
ann
who
stood
there
so
straight
in
her
gingham
dress
and
apron
with
her
clear
bright
eyes
and
red
cheeks
besides
this
feeling
elizabeth
ann
was
overcome
with
embarrassment
at
the
idea
of
undertaking
a
new
task
in
that
casual
way
how
in
the
world
did
you
wash
dishes
she
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
irresolute
horribly
shy
and
looking
though
she
did
not
know
it
very
clouded
and
sullen
cousin
ann
said
briskly
holding
an
iron
up
to
her
cheek
to
see
if
it
was
hot
enough
just
take
them
over
to
the
sink
there
and
hold
them
under
the
faucet
they
be
clean
in
no
time
the
are
those
hanging
on
the
rack
over
the
stove
elizabeth
ann
moved
promptly
over
to
the
sink
as
though
cousin
words
had
shoved
her
there
and
before
she
knew
it
her
saucer
cup
and
spoon
were
clean
and
she
was
wiping
them
on
a
dry
checked
towel
the
spoon
goes
in
the
drawer
with
the
other
silver
and
the
saucer
and
cup
in
those
shelves
there
behind
the
glass
doors
where
the
china
belongs
continued
cousin
ann
thumping
hard
with
her
iron
on
a
napkin
and
not
looking
up
at
all
and
do
forget
your
apple
as
you
go
out
those
northern
spies
are
just
getting
to
be
good
about
now
when
they
first
come
off
the
tree
in
october
you
could
shoot
them
through
an
oak
plank
now
elizabeth
ann
knew
that
this
was
a
foolish
thing
to
say
since
of
course
an
apple
never
could
go
through
a
board
but
something
that
had
always
been
sound
asleep
in
her
brain
woke
up
a
little
little
bit
and
opened
one
eye
for
it
occurred
dimly
to
elizabeth
ann
that
this
was
a
rather
funny
way
of
saying
that
northern
spies
were
very
hard
when
you
first
pick
them
in
the
autumn
she
had
to
figure
it
out
for
herself
very
slowly
because
it
was
a
new
idea
to
her
and
she
was
through
her
tour
of
inspection
of
the
house
before
there
glimmered
on
her
lips
in
a
faint
smile
the
first
recognition
of
humor
in
all
her
life
she
felt
a
momentary
impulse
to
call
down
to
cousin
ann
that
she
saw
the
point
but
before
she
had
taken
a
single
step
toward
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
had
decided
not
to
do
this
cousin
ann
with
her
bright
dark
eyes
and
her
straight
back
and
her
long
arms
and
her
way
of
speaking
as
though
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
you
would
do
just
as
she
said
elizabeth
ann
was
not
very
sure
that
she
liked
cousin
ann
and
she
was
very
sure
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
so
she
went
on
walking
from
one
room
to
another
industriously
eating
the
red
apple
the
biggest
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
the
best
too
with
its
crisp
white
flesh
and
the
delicious
juice
which
made
elizabeth
ann
feel
with
each
mouthful
like
hurrying
to
take
another
she
did
not
think
much
more
of
the
other
rooms
in
the
house
than
she
had
of
the
kitchen
there
were
no
draped
throws
over
anything
there
were
no
lace
curtains
at
the
windows
just
dotted
swiss
like
the
kitchen
all
the
ceilings
were
very
low
the
furniture
was
all
of
dark
wood
and
very
what
few
rugs
there
were
were
of
rags
the
mirrors
were
queer
and
old
with
funny
old
pictures
at
the
top
there
was
a
brass
bed
in
any
of
the
bedrooms
just
old
wooden
ones
with
posts
and
curtains
round
the
tops
and
there
was
not
a
single
plush
portiere
in
the
parlor
whereas
at
aunt
harriet
there
had
been
two
sets
for
that
one
room
she
was
relieved
at
the
absence
of
a
piano
and
secretly
rejoiced
that
she
would
not
need
to
practice
in
her
heart
she
had
not
liked
her
music
lessons
at
all
but
she
had
never
dreamed
of
not
accepting
them
from
aunt
frances
as
she
accepted
everything
else
also
she
had
liked
to
hear
aunt
frances
boast
about
how
much
better
she
could
play
than
other
children
of
her
age
she
was
downstairs
by
this
time
and
opening
a
door
out
of
the
parlor
found
herself
back
in
the
kitchen
the
long
line
of
sunny
windows
and
the
bright
flowers
giving
her
that
quick
little
thrill
again
cousin
ann
looked
up
from
her
ironing
nodded
and
said
all
through
you
better
come
in
and
get
warmed
up
those
rooms
get
awfully
cold
these
january
days
winters
we
mostly
use
this
room
so
to
get
the
good
of
the
kitchen
stove
she
added
after
a
moment
during
which
elizabeth
ann
stood
by
the
stove
warming
her
hands
there
one
place
you
seen
yet
the
mother
down
there
now
churning
that
the
door
the
middle
one
elizabeth
ann
had
been
wondering
and
wondering
where
in
the
world
aunt
abigail
was
so
she
stepped
quickly
to
the
door
and
went
dawn
the
cold
dark
stairs
she
found
there
at
the
bottom
was
a
door
locked
apparently
for
she
could
find
no
fastening
she
heard
steps
inside
the
door
was
briskly
cast
open
and
she
almost
fell
into
the
arms
of
aunt
abigail
who
caught
her
as
she
stumbled
forward
saying
well
been
expectin
you
down
here
for
a
long
time
i
never
saw
a
little
girl
yet
who
did
like
to
watch
do
you
love
to
run
the
over
it
i
do
myself
for
all
i
i
do
know
anything
about
it
said
elizabeth
ann
i
do
know
what
you
make
butter
out
of
we
always
bought
ours
well
for
goodness
sakes
said
aunt
abigail
she
turned
and
called
across
the
room
henry
did
you
ever
here
betsy
saying
she
know
what
we
make
butter
out
of
she
actually
never
saw
anybody
making
butter
uncle
henry
was
sitting
down
near
the
window
turning
the
handle
to
a
small
barrel
swung
between
two
uprights
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
considered
aunt
abigail
remark
with
the
same
serious
attention
he
had
given
to
elizabeth
ann
discovery
about
left
and
right
then
he
began
to
turn
the
churn
over
and
over
again
and
said
peaceably
well
mother
you
never
saw
anybody
laying
asphalt
pavement
i
warrant
you
and
i
suppose
betsy
knows
all
about
that
elizabeth
ann
spirits
rose
she
felt
very
superior
indeed
oh
yes
she
assured
them
i
know
all
about
that
did
you
ever
see
anybody
doing
that
why
i
seen
them
hundreds
of
times
every
day
as
we
went
to
school
they
were
doing
over
the
whole
pavement
for
blocks
along
there
aunt
abigail
and
uncle
henry
looked
at
her
with
interest
and
aunt
abigail
said
well
now
think
of
that
tell
us
all
about
it
why
there
a
big
black
sort
of
wagon
began
elizabeth
ann
and
they
run
it
up
and
down
and
pour
out
the
black
stuff
on
the
road
and
all
there
is
to
it
she
stopped
rather
abruptly
looking
uneasy
uncle
henry
inquired
now
there
one
thing
i
always
wanted
to
know
how
do
they
keep
that
stuff
from
hardening
on
them
how
do
they
keep
it
hot
the
little
girl
looked
blank
why
a
fire
i
suppose
she
faltered
searching
her
memory
desperately
and
finding
there
only
a
dim
recollection
of
a
red
glow
somewhere
connected
with
the
familiar
scene
at
which
she
had
so
often
looked
with
unseeing
eyes
of
course
a
fire
agreed
uncle
henry
but
what
do
they
burn
in
it
coke
or
coal
or
wood
or
charcoal
and
how
do
they
get
any
draft
to
keep
it
going
elizabeth
ann
shook
her
head
i
never
noticed
she
said
aunt
abigail
asked
her
now
what
do
they
do
to
the
road
before
they
pour
it
on
do
said
elizabeth
ann
i
did
know
they
did
anything
well
they
ca
pour
it
right
on
a
dirt
road
can
they
asked
aunt
abigail
do
they
put
down
cracked
stone
or
something
elizabeth
ann
looked
down
at
her
toes
i
never
noticed
she
said
i
wonder
how
long
it
takes
for
it
to
harden
said
uncle
henry
i
never
noticed
said
elizabeth
ann
in
a
small
voice
uncle
henry
said
oh
and
stopped
asking
questions
aunt
abigail
turned
away
and
put
a
stick
of
wood
in
the
stove
elizabeth
ann
did
not
feel
very
superior
now
and
when
aunt
abigail
said
now
the
beginning
to
come
do
you
want
to
watch
and
see
everything
i
do
you
can
answer
if
anybody
asks
you
how
butter
is
made
elizabeth
ann
understood
perfectly
what
was
in
aunt
abigail
mind
and
gave
to
the
process
of
a
more
alert
and
aroused
attention
than
she
had
ever
before
given
to
anything
it
was
so
interesting
too
that
in
no
time
she
forgot
why
she
was
watching
and
was
absorbed
in
the
fascinations
of
the
dairy
for
their
own
sake
she
looked
in
the
churn
as
aunt
abigail
unscrewed
the
top
and
saw
the
thick
sour
cream
separating
into
buttermilk
and
tiny
golden
particles
it
gathering
said
aunt
abigail
screwing
the
lid
back
on
father
churn
it
a
little
more
till
it
really
comes
and
you
and
i
will
scald
the
wooden
butter
things
and
get
everything
ready
better
take
that
apron
there
to
keep
your
dress
clean
would
aunt
frances
have
been
astonished
if
she
could
have
looked
in
on
elizabeth
ann
that
very
first
morning
of
her
stay
at
the
hateful
putney
farm
and
have
seen
her
wrapped
in
a
gingham
apron
her
face
bright
with
interest
trotting
here
and
there
in
the
she
was
allowed
the
excitement
of
pulling
out
the
plug
from
the
bottom
of
the
churn
and
dodged
back
hastily
to
escape
the
gush
of
buttermilk
spouting
into
the
pail
held
by
aunt
abigail
and
she
poured
the
water
in
to
wash
the
butter
and
screwed
on
the
top
herself
and
again
all
herself
for
uncle
henry
had
gone
off
as
soon
as
the
butter
had
come
swung
the
barrel
back
and
forth
six
or
seven
times
to
swish
the
water
all
through
the
particles
of
butter
she
even
helped
aunt
abigail
scoop
out
the
great
yellow
lumps
her
imagination
had
never
conceived
of
so
much
butter
in
all
the
world
then
aunt
abigail
let
her
run
the
curiously
shaped
wooden
back
and
forth
over
the
butter
squeezing
out
the
water
and
then
pile
it
up
again
with
her
wooden
paddle
into
a
mound
of
gold
she
weighed
out
the
salt
needed
on
the
scales
and
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
that
there
really
is
such
a
thing
as
an
ounce
she
had
never
met
it
before
outside
the
pages
of
her
arithmetic
book
and
she
did
know
it
lived
anywhere
else
after
the
salt
was
worked
in
she
watched
aunt
abigail
deft
wrinkled
old
hands
make
pats
and
rolls
it
looked
like
the
greatest
fun
and
too
easy
for
anything
and
when
aunt
abigail
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
make
up
the
last
into
a
pat
for
dinner
she
took
up
the
wooden
paddle
confidently
and
then
she
got
one
of
the
surprises
that
putney
farm
seemed
to
have
for
her
she
discovered
that
her
hands
seem
to
belong
to
her
at
all
that
her
fingers
were
all
thumbs
that
she
did
seem
to
know
in
the
least
beforehand
how
hard
a
stroke
she
was
going
to
give
nor
which
way
her
fingers
were
going
to
go
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
first
time
elizabeth
ann
had
tried
to
do
anything
with
her
hands
except
to
write
and
figure
and
play
on
the
piano
and
naturally
she
was
very
well
acquainted
with
them
she
stopped
in
dismay
looking
at
the
shapeless
battered
heap
of
butter
before
her
and
holding
out
her
hands
as
though
they
were
not
part
of
her
aunt
abigail
laughed
took
up
the
paddle
and
after
three
or
four
passes
the
butter
was
a
smooth
yellow
ball
well
that
brings
it
all
back
to
me
she
said
when
was
a
little
girl
when
my
grandmother
first
let
me
try
to
make
a
pat
i
was
about
five
years
old
my
what
a
mess
i
made
of
it
and
i
remember
does
it
seem
funny
that
she
laughed
and
said
her
elmira
had
taught
her
how
to
handle
butter
right
here
in
this
very
let
see
grandmother
was
born
the
year
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
that
quite
a
while
ago
is
it
but
butter
has
changed
much
i
guess
nor
little
girls
either
elizabeth
ann
listened
to
this
statement
with
a
very
queer
startled
expression
on
her
face
as
though
she
had
understood
the
words
now
for
a
moment
she
stood
staring
up
in
aunt
abigail
face
and
yet
not
seeing
her
at
all
because
she
was
thinking
so
hard
she
was
thinking
why
there
were
real
people
living
when
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
real
people
not
just
history
people
old
women
teaching
little
girls
how
to
do
things
right
in
this
very
room
on
this
very
floor
and
the
declaration
of
independence
just
signed
to
tell
the
honest
truth
although
she
had
passed
a
very
good
examination
in
the
little
book
on
american
history
they
had
studied
in
school
elizabeth
ann
had
never
to
that
moment
had
any
notion
that
there
ever
had
been
really
and
truly
any
declaration
of
independence
at
all
it
had
been
like
the
ounce
living
exclusively
inside
her
schoolbooks
for
little
girls
to
be
examined
about
and
now
here
aunt
abigail
talking
about
a
had
brought
it
to
life
of
course
all
this
only
lasted
a
moment
because
it
was
such
a
new
idea
she
soon
lost
track
of
what
she
was
thinking
of
she
rubbed
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
coming
out
of
a
dream
she
thought
confusedly
what
did
butter
have
to
do
with
the
declaration
of
independence
nothing
of
course
it
could
and
the
whole
impression
seemed
to
pass
out
of
her
mind
but
it
was
an
impression
which
was
to
come
again
and
again
during
the
next
few
months
chapter
iv
betsy
goes
to
school
elizabeth
ann
was
very
much
surprised
to
hear
cousin
ann
voice
calling
dinner
down
the
stairs
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
the
whole
morning
had
gone
by
here
said
aunt
abigail
just
put
that
pat
on
a
plate
will
you
and
take
it
upstairs
as
you
go
i
got
all
i
can
do
to
haul
my
own
two
hundred
pounds
up
without
any
of
butter
into
the
bargain
the
little
girl
smiled
at
this
though
she
did
not
exactly
know
why
and
skipped
up
the
stairs
proudly
with
her
butter
dinner
was
smoking
on
the
table
which
was
set
in
the
midst
of
the
great
pool
of
sunlight
a
very
large
dog
with
a
great
bushy
tail
was
walking
around
and
around
the
table
sniffing
the
air
he
looked
as
big
as
a
bear
to
elizabeth
ann
and
as
he
walked
his
great
red
tongue
hung
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
white
teeth
gleamed
horribly
elizabeth
ann
shrank
back
in
terror
clutching
her
plate
of
butter
to
her
breast
with
tense
fingers
cousin
ann
said
over
her
shoulder
oh
bother
there
old
shep
got
up
to
pester
us
begging
for
scraps
shep
you
go
and
lie
down
this
minute
to
elizabeth
ann
astonishment
and
immense
relief
the
great
animal
turned
drooping
his
head
sadly
walked
back
across
the
floor
got
upon
the
couch
again
and
laid
his
head
down
on
one
paw
very
forlornly
turning
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
meekly
at
cousin
ann
aunt
abigail
who
had
just
pulled
herself
up
the
stairs
panting
said
between
laughing
and
puffing
i
glad
i
not
an
animal
on
this
farm
ann
does
boss
them
around
so
well
somebody
has
to
said
cousin
ann
advancing
on
the
table
with
a
platter
this
proved
to
have
chicken
fricassee
on
it
and
elizabeth
ann
heart
melted
in
her
at
the
smell
she
loved
chicken
gravy
on
hot
biscuits
beyond
anything
in
the
world
but
chickens
are
so
expensive
when
you
buy
them
in
the
market
that
aunt
harriet
had
had
them
very
often
for
dinner
and
there
was
a
plate
of
biscuits
golden
brown
just
coming
out
of
the
oven
she
sat
down
very
quickly
her
mouth
watering
and
attacked
with
extreme
haste
the
big
plateful
of
food
which
cousin
ann
passed
her
at
aunt
harriet
she
had
always
been
aware
that
everybody
watched
her
anxiously
as
she
ate
and
she
had
heard
so
much
about
her
light
appetite
that
she
felt
she
must
live
up
to
her
reputation
and
had
a
very
natural
and
human
hesitation
about
eating
all
she
wanted
when
there
happened
to
be
something
she
liked
very
much
but
nobody
here
knew
that
she
only
ate
enough
to
keep
a
bird
alive
and
that
her
appetite
was
so
capricious
nor
did
anybody
notice
her
while
she
stowed
away
the
chicken
and
gravy
and
hot
biscuits
and
currant
jelly
and
baked
potatoes
and
apple
pie
when
did
elizabeth
ann
ever
eat
such
a
meal
before
she
actually
felt
her
belt
grow
tight
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
cousin
ann
got
up
to
answer
the
telephone
which
was
in
the
next
room
the
instant
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
uncle
henry
leaned
forward
tapped
elizabeth
ann
on
the
shoulder
and
nodded
toward
the
sofa
his
eyes
were
twinkling
and
as
for
aunt
abigail
she
began
to
laugh
silently
shaking
all
over
her
napkin
at
her
mouth
to
stifle
the
sound
elizabeth
ann
turned
wonderingly
and
saw
the
old
dog
cautiously
and
noiselessly
letting
himself
down
from
the
sofa
one
ear
cocked
rigidly
in
the
direction
of
cousin
ann
voice
in
the
next
room
the
old
tyke
said
uncle
henry
he
always
sneaks
up
to
the
table
to
be
fed
if
ann
goes
out
for
a
minute
here
betsy
nearest
give
him
this
piece
of
skin
from
the
chicken
neck
the
big
dog
padded
forward
across
the
room
evidently
in
such
a
state
of
terror
about
cousin
ann
that
elizabeth
ann
felt
for
him
she
had
a
about
that
relative
of
hers
also
it
was
impossible
to
be
afraid
of
so
abjectly
meek
and
guilty
an
animal
as
old
shep
came
up
to
her
poking
his
nose
inquiringly
on
her
lap
she
shrinkingly
held
out
the
big
piece
of
skin
and
though
she
jumped
back
at
the
sudden
snap
and
gobbling
gulp
with
which
the
old
dog
greeted
the
tidbit
she
could
not
but
sympathize
with
his
evident
enjoyment
of
it
he
waved
his
bushy
tail
gratefully
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
ears
standing
up
at
attention
his
eyes
glistening
greedily
he
gave
a
little
begging
whine
oh
he
asking
for
more
cried
elizabeth
ann
surprised
to
see
how
plainly
she
could
understand
quick
uncle
henry
give
me
another
piece
uncle
henry
rapidly
transferred
to
her
plate
a
from
his
own
and
aunt
abigail
with
one
deft
swoop
contributed
the
neck
from
the
platter
as
fast
as
she
could
elizabeth
ann
fed
these
to
shep
who
woofed
them
down
at
top
speed
the
bones
crunching
loudly
under
his
strong
white
teeth
how
he
did
enjoy
it
it
did
your
heart
good
to
see
his
gusto
illustration
oh
he
asking
for
more
cried
elizabeth
ann
there
was
the
sound
of
the
telephone
receiver
being
hung
up
in
the
next
room
and
everybody
acted
at
once
aunt
abigail
began
drinking
innocently
out
of
her
only
her
laughing
old
eyes
showing
over
the
rim
uncle
henry
buttered
a
slice
of
bread
with
a
grave
face
as
though
he
were
deep
in
conjectures
about
who
would
be
the
next
president
and
as
for
old
shep
he
made
one
plunge
across
the
room
his
clicking
rapidly
on
the
bare
floor
sprang
up
on
the
couch
and
when
cousin
ann
opened
the
door
and
came
in
he
was
lying
in
exactly
the
position
in
which
she
had
left
him
his
paw
stretched
out
his
head
laid
on
it
his
brown
eyes
turned
up
meekly
so
that
the
whites
showed
i
told
you
what
these
three
did
but
i
have
told
you
yet
what
elizabeth
ann
did
and
it
is
worth
telling
as
cousin
ann
stepped
in
glancing
suspiciously
from
her
and
abstracted
parents
to
the
innocence
of
old
shep
little
elizabeth
ann
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
it
worth
telling
about
because
so
far
as
i
know
that
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
laughed
out
heartily
in
all
her
life
for
my
part
i
half
surprised
to
know
that
she
knew
how
of
course
when
she
laughed
aunt
abigail
had
to
laugh
too
setting
down
her
and
showing
all
the
funny
wrinkles
in
her
face
screwed
up
hard
with
fun
and
that
made
uncle
henry
laugh
and
then
cousin
ann
laughed
and
said
as
she
sat
down
you
are
bad
children
the
whole
four
of
you
and
old
shep
seeing
the
state
of
things
stopped
pretending
to
be
meek
jumped
down
and
came
lumbering
over
to
the
table
wagging
his
tail
and
laughing
too
you
know
that
good
wide
he
put
his
head
on
elizabeth
ann
lap
again
and
she
patted
it
and
lifted
up
one
of
his
big
black
ears
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
she
was
terribly
afraid
of
big
dogs
after
dinner
cousin
ann
looked
up
at
the
clock
and
said
my
goodness
betsy
be
late
for
school
if
she
does
start
right
off
she
explained
to
the
child
aghast
at
this
sudden
thunderclap
i
let
you
sleep
this
morning
as
long
as
you
wanted
to
because
you
were
so
tired
from
your
journey
but
of
course
there
no
reason
for
missing
the
afternoon
session
as
elizabeth
ann
continued
sitting
perfectly
still
frozen
with
alarm
cousin
ann
jumped
up
briskly
got
the
little
coat
and
cap
helped
her
up
and
began
inserting
the
child
arms
into
the
sleeves
she
pulled
the
cap
well
down
over
elizabeth
ann
ears
felt
in
the
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
mittens
there
she
said
holding
them
out
better
put
them
on
before
you
go
out
for
it
a
real
cold
day
as
she
led
the
stupefied
little
girl
along
toward
the
door
aunt
abigail
came
after
them
and
put
a
big
into
the
child
hand
maybe
you
like
to
eat
that
for
your
recess
time
she
said
i
always
did
when
i
went
to
school
elizabeth
ann
hand
closed
automatically
about
the
cookie
but
she
scarcely
heard
what
was
said
she
felt
herself
to
be
in
a
bad
dream
aunt
frances
had
never
no
never
let
her
go
to
school
alone
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
always
took
her
to
the
new
teacher
and
introduced
her
and
told
the
teacher
how
sensitive
she
was
and
how
hard
to
understand
and
then
she
stayed
there
for
an
hour
or
two
till
elizabeth
ann
got
used
to
things
she
could
not
face
a
whole
new
school
all
alone
oh
she
could
she
would
she
could
horrors
here
she
was
in
the
front
hall
she
was
on
the
porch
cousin
ann
was
saying
now
run
along
child
straight
down
the
road
till
the
first
turn
to
the
left
and
there
in
the
there
you
are
and
now
the
front
door
closed
behind
her
the
path
stretched
before
her
to
the
road
and
the
road
led
down
the
hill
the
way
cousin
ann
had
pointed
elizabeth
ann
feet
began
to
move
forward
and
carried
her
down
the
path
although
she
was
still
crying
out
to
herself
i
ca
i
wo
i
ca
are
you
wondering
why
elizabeth
ann
did
turn
right
around
open
the
front
door
walk
in
and
say
i
ca
i
wo
i
ca
to
cousin
ann
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
she
did
do
it
because
cousin
ann
was
cousin
ann
and
there
more
in
that
than
you
think
in
fact
there
is
a
mystery
in
it
that
nobody
has
ever
solved
not
even
the
greatest
scientists
and
philosophers
although
like
all
scientists
and
philosophers
they
think
they
have
gone
a
long
way
toward
explaining
something
they
do
understand
by
calling
it
a
long
name
the
long
name
is
personality
and
what
it
means
nobody
knows
but
it
is
perhaps
the
very
most
important
thing
in
the
world
for
all
that
and
yet
we
know
only
one
or
two
things
about
it
we
know
that
anybody
personality
is
made
up
of
the
sum
total
of
all
the
actions
and
thoughts
and
desires
of
his
life
and
we
know
that
though
there
are
any
words
or
any
figures
in
any
language
to
set
down
that
sum
total
accurately
still
it
is
one
of
the
first
things
that
everybody
knows
about
anybody
else
and
that
is
really
all
we
know
so
i
ca
tell
you
why
elizabeth
ann
did
not
go
back
and
cry
and
sob
and
say
she
could
and
she
would
and
she
could
as
she
would
certainly
have
done
at
aunt
harriet
you
remember
that
i
could
not
even
tell
you
why
it
was
that
as
the
little
fatherless
and
motherless
girl
lay
in
bed
looking
at
aunt
abigail
old
face
she
should
feel
so
comforted
and
protected
that
she
must
needs
break
out
crying
no
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
was
because
aunt
abigail
was
aunt
abigail
but
perhaps
it
may
occur
to
you
that
it
rather
a
good
idea
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
your
personality
whatever
that
is
it
might
be
very
handy
you
know
to
have
a
personality
like
cousin
ann
which
sent
elizabeth
feet
down
the
path
or
perhaps
you
would
prefer
one
like
aunt
abigail
well
take
your
choice
you
must
not
of
course
think
for
a
moment
that
elizabeth
ann
had
the
slightest
intention
of
obeying
cousin
ann
no
indeed
nothing
was
farther
from
her
mind
as
her
feet
carried
her
along
the
path
and
into
the
road
in
her
mind
was
nothing
but
rebellion
and
fear
and
anger
and
oh
such
hurt
feelings
she
turned
sick
at
the
very
thought
of
facing
all
the
staring
curious
faces
in
the
playground
turned
on
the
new
scholar
as
she
had
seen
them
at
home
she
would
never
never
do
it
she
would
walk
around
all
the
afternoon
and
then
go
back
and
tell
cousin
ann
that
she
could
she
would
explain
to
her
how
aunt
frances
never
let
her
go
out
of
doors
without
a
loving
hand
to
cling
to
she
would
explain
to
her
how
aunt
frances
always
took
care
of
her
it
was
easier
to
think
about
what
she
would
say
and
do
and
explain
away
from
cousin
ann
than
it
was
to
say
and
do
it
before
those
black
eyes
aunt
frances
eyes
were
soft
light
blue
oh
how
she
wanted
aunt
frances
to
take
care
of
her
nobody
cared
a
thing
about
her
nobody
understood
her
but
aunt
frances
she
would
go
back
at
all
to
putney
farm
she
would
just
walk
on
and
on
till
she
was
lost
and
the
night
would
come
and
she
would
lie
down
and
freeze
to
death
and
then
would
cousin
ann
feel
someone
called
to
her
is
this
betsy
she
looked
up
astonished
a
young
girl
in
a
gingham
dress
and
a
white
apron
like
those
at
putney
farm
stood
in
front
of
a
tiny
square
building
like
a
toy
house
is
this
betsy
asked
the
young
girl
again
your
cousin
ann
said
you
were
coming
to
school
today
and
been
looking
out
for
you
but
i
saw
you
going
right
by
and
i
ran
out
to
stop
you
why
where
is
the
school
asked
betsy
staring
around
for
a
big
brick
building
the
young
girl
laughed
and
held
out
her
hand
this
is
the
school
she
said
and
i
am
the
teacher
and
you
better
come
right
in
for
time
to
begin
she
led
betsy
into
a
room
with
geraniums
at
the
windows
where
about
a
dozen
children
of
different
ages
sat
behind
their
desks
at
the
first
sight
of
them
betsy
blushed
crimson
with
fright
and
shyness
and
hung
down
her
head
but
looking
out
the
corners
of
her
eyes
she
saw
that
they
too
were
all
very
and
and
hung
down
their
heads
looking
at
her
shyly
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
she
was
so
surprised
by
this
that
she
forgot
all
about
herself
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
teacher
they
do
see
many
strangers
the
teacher
explained
and
they
feel
very
shy
and
scared
when
a
new
scholar
comes
especially
one
from
the
city
is
this
my
grade
asked
elizabeth
thinking
it
the
very
smallest
grade
she
had
ever
seen
this
is
the
whole
school
said
the
teacher
there
are
only
two
or
three
in
each
class
you
probably
have
three
in
yours
miss
ann
said
you
were
in
the
third
grade
there
that
your
seat
elizabeth
sat
down
before
a
very
old
desk
much
battered
and
hacked
up
with
knife
marks
there
was
a
big
carved
just
over
the
inkwell
and
many
other
initials
scattered
all
over
the
top
the
teacher
stepped
back
to
her
desk
and
took
up
a
violin
that
lay
there
now
children
we
begin
the
afternoon
session
by
singing
she
said
she
played
the
air
over
a
little
very
sweetly
and
stirringly
and
then
as
the
children
stood
up
she
came
down
close
to
them
standing
just
in
front
of
betsy
she
drew
the
bow
across
the
strings
in
a
big
chord
and
said
now
and
betsy
burst
into
song
with
the
others
the
sun
came
in
the
windows
brightly
the
teacher
too
sang
as
she
played
and
all
the
children
even
the
littlest
ones
opened
their
mouths
wide
and
sang
lustily
chapter
v
what
grade
is
betsy
after
the
singing
the
teacher
gave
elizabeth
ann
a
pile
of
schoolbooks
some
paper
some
pencils
and
a
pen
and
told
her
to
set
her
desk
in
order
there
were
more
initials
carved
inside
another
big
with
a
little
under
it
what
a
lot
of
children
must
have
sat
there
thought
the
little
girl
as
she
arranged
her
books
and
papers
as
she
shut
down
the
lid
the
teacher
finished
giving
some
instructions
to
three
or
four
little
ones
and
said
betsy
and
ralph
and
ellen
bring
your
reading
books
up
here
betsy
sighed
took
out
her
reader
and
went
with
the
other
two
up
to
the
battered
old
bench
near
the
teacher
desk
she
knew
all
about
reading
lessons
and
she
hated
them
although
she
loved
to
read
but
reading
lessons
you
sat
with
your
book
open
at
some
reading
that
you
could
do
with
your
eyes
shut
it
was
so
easy
and
you
waited
and
waited
and
waited
while
your
classmates
slowly
stumbled
along
reading
aloud
a
sentence
or
two
apiece
until
your
turn
came
to
stand
up
and
read
your
sentence
or
two
which
by
that
time
sounded
just
like
nonsense
because
you
read
it
over
and
over
so
many
times
to
yourself
before
your
chance
came
and
often
you
did
even
have
a
chance
to
do
that
because
the
teacher
did
have
time
to
get
around
to
you
at
all
and
you
closed
your
book
and
put
it
back
in
your
desk
without
having
opened
your
mouth
reading
was
one
thing
elizabeth
ann
had
learned
to
do
very
well
indeed
but
she
had
learned
it
all
by
herself
at
home
from
much
reading
to
herself
aunt
frances
had
kept
her
well
supplied
with
children
books
from
the
nearest
public
library
she
often
read
three
a
week
very
different
that
from
a
sentence
or
two
once
or
twice
a
week
when
she
sat
down
on
the
battered
old
bench
she
almost
laughed
aloud
it
seemed
so
funny
to
be
in
a
class
of
only
three
there
had
been
forty
in
her
grade
in
the
big
brick
building
she
sat
in
the
middle
the
little
girl
whom
the
teacher
had
called
ellen
on
one
side
and
ralph
on
the
other
ellen
was
very
pretty
with
fair
hair
smoothly
braided
in
two
little
sweet
blue
eyes
and
a
clean
gingham
dress
ralph
had
very
black
eyes
dark
hair
a
big
bruise
on
his
forehead
a
cut
on
his
chin
and
a
tear
in
the
knee
of
his
short
trousers
he
was
much
bigger
than
ellen
and
elizabeth
ann
thought
he
looked
rather
fierce
she
decided
that
she
would
be
afraid
of
him
and
would
not
like
him
at
all
page
said
the
teacher
ralph
first
ralph
stood
up
and
began
to
read
it
sounded
very
familiar
to
elizabeth
ann
for
he
did
not
read
at
all
well
what
was
not
familiar
was
that
the
teacher
did
not
stop
him
after
the
first
sentence
he
read
on
and
on
till
he
had
read
a
page
the
teacher
only
helping
him
with
the
hardest
words
now
betsy
said
the
teacher
elizabeth
ann
stood
up
read
the
first
sentence
and
paused
like
a
caged
lion
pausing
when
he
comes
to
the
end
of
his
cage
go
on
said
the
teacher
elizabeth
ann
read
the
next
sentence
and
stopped
again
automatically
go
on
said
the
teacher
looking
at
her
sharply
the
next
time
the
little
girl
paused
the
teacher
laughed
out
what
is
the
matter
with
you
betsy
she
said
go
on
till
i
tell
you
to
stop
so
elizabeth
ann
very
much
surprised
but
very
much
interested
read
on
sentence
after
sentence
till
she
forgot
they
were
sentences
and
just
thought
of
what
they
meant
she
read
a
whole
page
and
then
another
page
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
selection
she
had
never
read
aloud
so
much
in
her
life
she
was
aware
that
everybody
in
the
room
had
stopped
working
to
listen
to
her
she
felt
very
proud
and
less
afraid
than
she
had
ever
thought
she
could
be
in
a
schoolroom
when
she
finished
you
read
very
well
said
the
teacher
is
this
very
easy
for
you
oh
yes
said
elizabeth
ann
i
guess
then
that
you
better
not
stay
in
this
class
said
the
teacher
she
took
a
book
out
of
her
desk
see
if
you
can
read
that
elizabeth
ann
began
in
her
usual
style
very
slow
and
monotonous
but
this
did
seem
like
a
reader
at
all
it
was
poetry
full
of
hard
words
that
were
fun
to
try
to
pronounce
and
it
was
all
about
an
old
woman
who
would
hang
out
an
american
flag
even
though
the
town
was
full
of
rebel
soldiers
she
read
faster
and
faster
getting
more
and
more
excited
till
she
broke
out
with
halt
in
such
a
loud
spirited
voice
that
the
sound
of
it
startled
her
and
made
her
stop
fearing
that
she
would
be
laughed
at
but
nobody
laughed
they
were
all
listening
very
eagerly
even
the
little
ones
with
their
eyes
turned
toward
her
you
might
as
well
go
on
and
let
us
see
how
it
came
out
said
the
teacher
and
betsy
finished
triumphantly
well
said
the
teacher
there
no
sense
in
your
reading
along
in
the
third
reader
after
this
you
recite
out
of
the
seventh
reader
with
frank
and
harry
and
stashie
elizabeth
ann
could
not
believe
her
ears
to
be
jumped
four
grades
in
that
casual
way
it
was
possible
she
at
once
thought
however
of
something
that
would
prevent
it
entirely
and
while
ellen
was
reading
her
page
in
a
slow
careful
little
voice
elizabeth
ann
was
feeling
miserably
that
she
must
explain
to
the
teacher
why
she
could
read
with
the
children
oh
how
she
wished
she
could
when
they
stood
up
to
go
back
to
their
seats
she
hesitated
hung
her
head
and
looked
very
unhappy
did
you
want
to
say
something
to
me
asked
the
teacher
pausing
with
a
bit
of
chalk
in
her
hand
the
little
girl
went
up
to
her
desk
and
said
what
she
knew
it
was
her
duty
to
confess
i
ca
be
allowed
to
read
in
the
seventh
reader
i
do
write
a
bit
well
and
i
never
get
the
mental
right
i
could
do
anything
with
arithmetic
the
teacher
looked
a
little
blank
and
said
did
say
anything
about
your
i
do
know
anything
about
it
you
recited
yet
she
turned
away
and
began
to
write
a
list
of
words
on
the
board
betsy
ralph
and
ellen
study
their
spelling
she
said
you
little
ones
come
up
for
your
reading
two
little
boys
and
two
little
girls
came
forward
as
elizabeth
ann
began
to
con
over
the
words
on
the
board
at
first
she
found
she
was
listening
to
the
little
chirping
voices
as
the
children
straggled
with
their
reading
instead
of
studying
doubt
travel
cheese
and
the
other
words
in
her
lesson
but
she
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
and
her
mind
on
her
spelling
she
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
with
that
lesson
after
a
while
when
she
was
sure
she
could
spell
them
all
correctly
she
began
to
listen
and
look
around
her
she
always
got
her
spelling
in
less
time
than
was
allowed
the
class
and
usually
sat
idle
looking
out
of
the
window
until
that
study
period
was
over
but
now
the
moment
she
stopped
staring
at
the
board
and
moving
her
lips
as
she
spelled
to
herself
the
teacher
said
just
as
though
she
had
been
watching
her
every
minute
instead
of
conducting
a
class
betsy
have
you
learned
your
spelling
yes
i
think
so
said
elizabeth
ann
wondering
very
much
why
she
was
asked
that
fine
said
the
teacher
i
wish
you
take
little
molly
over
in
that
corner
and
help
her
with
her
reading
she
getting
on
so
much
better
than
the
rest
of
the
class
that
i
hate
to
have
her
lose
her
time
just
hear
her
read
the
rest
of
her
little
story
will
you
and
help
her
unless
she
really
stuck
elizabeth
ann
was
startled
by
this
request
which
was
unheard
of
in
her
experience
she
was
very
uncertain
of
herself
as
she
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
in
the
corner
of
the
schoolroom
away
from
the
desks
with
the
little
child
leaning
on
her
knee
and
yet
she
was
not
exactly
afraid
either
because
molly
was
such
a
shy
little
thing
with
her
crop
of
yellow
curls
and
her
bright
blue
eyes
very
serious
as
she
looked
hard
at
the
book
and
began
once
there
was
a
rat
it
was
a
fat
rat
no
it
was
impossible
to
be
frightened
of
such
a
funny
little
girl
who
peered
so
earnestly
into
the
older
child
face
to
make
sure
she
was
doing
her
lesson
right
elizabeth
ann
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
children
younger
than
herself
and
she
felt
very
pleased
and
important
to
have
anybody
look
up
to
her
she
put
her
arm
around
molly
square
warm
fat
little
body
and
gave
her
a
squeeze
molly
snuggled
up
closer
and
the
two
children
put
their
heads
together
over
the
printed
page
elizabeth
ann
correcting
molly
very
gently
indeed
when
she
made
a
mistake
and
waiting
patiently
when
she
hesitated
she
had
so
fresh
in
her
mind
her
own
suffering
from
quick
nervous
corrections
that
she
took
the
greatest
pleasure
in
speaking
quietly
and
not
interrupting
the
little
girl
more
than
was
necessary
it
was
fun
to
teach
lots
of
fun
she
was
surprised
when
the
teacher
said
well
betsy
how
did
molly
do
oh
is
the
time
up
said
elizabeth
ann
why
she
does
beautifully
i
think
for
such
a
little
thing
do
you
suppose
said
the
teacher
thoughtfully
just
as
though
betsy
were
a
person
do
you
suppose
she
could
go
into
the
second
reader
with
eliza
there
no
use
keeping
her
in
the
first
if
ready
to
go
on
elizabeth
ann
head
whirled
with
this
second
juggling
with
the
sacred
distinction
between
the
grades
in
the
big
brick
schoolhouse
nobody
ever
went
into
another
grade
except
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
after
you
passed
a
lot
of
examinations
she
had
not
known
that
anybody
could
do
anything
else
the
idea
that
everybody
took
a
year
to
a
grade
no
matter
what
was
so
fixed
in
her
mind
that
she
felt
as
though
the
teacher
had
said
how
would
you
like
to
stop
being
nine
years
old
and
be
twelve
instead
and
do
you
think
molly
would
better
be
eight
instead
of
six
however
just
then
her
class
in
arithmetic
was
called
so
that
she
had
no
more
time
to
be
puzzled
she
came
forward
with
ralph
and
ellen
again
very
low
in
her
mind
she
hated
arithmetic
with
all
her
might
and
she
really
did
understand
a
thing
about
it
by
long
experience
she
had
learned
to
read
her
teachers
faces
very
accurately
and
she
guessed
by
their
expression
whether
the
answer
she
gave
was
the
right
one
and
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
tell
you
never
heard
of
any
other
child
who
did
that
did
you
they
had
mental
arithmetic
of
course
elizabeth
ann
thought
it
just
her
luck
and
of
course
it
was
those
hateful
eights
and
sevens
and
of
course
right
away
poor
betsy
got
the
one
she
hated
most
she
never
knew
that
one
she
said
dispiritedly
that
it
was
remembering
vaguely
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
fifties
ralph
burst
out
scornfully
and
the
teacher
as
if
she
wanted
to
take
him
down
for
showing
off
pounced
on
him
with
x
he
answered
without
drawing
breath
elizabeth
ann
shuddered
at
his
accuracy
ellen
too
rose
to
the
occasion
when
she
got
x
which
elizabeth
ann
could
sometimes
remember
and
sometimes
not
and
then
oh
horrors
it
was
her
turn
again
her
turn
had
never
before
come
more
than
twice
during
a
mental
arithmetic
lesson
she
was
so
startled
by
the
swiftness
with
which
the
question
went
around
that
she
balked
on
x
which
she
knew
perfectly
and
before
she
could
recover
ralph
had
answered
and
had
rattled
out
a
in
answer
to
x
and
then
ellen
slapped
down
an
on
top
of
x
good
gracious
who
could
have
guessed
from
the
way
they
read
they
could
do
their
tables
like
this
she
herself
missed
on
x
and
was
ready
to
cry
after
this
the
teacher
did
call
on
her
at
all
but
showered
questions
down
on
the
other
two
who
sent
the
answers
back
with
sickening
speed
after
the
lesson
the
teacher
said
smiling
well
betsy
you
were
right
about
your
arithmetic
i
guess
you
better
recite
with
eliza
for
a
while
she
doing
work
i
should
be
surprised
if
after
a
good
review
with
her
you
be
able
to
go
on
with
the
work
elizabeth
ann
fell
back
on
the
bench
with
her
mouth
open
she
felt
really
dizzy
what
crazy
things
the
teacher
said
she
felt
as
though
she
was
being
pulled
limb
from
limb
what
the
matter
asked
the
teacher
seeing
her
bewildered
fact
why
why
said
elizabeth
ann
i
do
know
what
i
am
at
all
if
arithmetic
and
reading
and
spelling
what
grade
am
i
the
teacher
laughed
at
the
turn
of
her
phrase
you
are
any
grade
at
all
no
matter
where
you
are
in
school
you
just
yourself
you
what
difference
does
it
make
what
grade
you
in
and
what
the
use
of
your
reading
little
baby
things
too
easy
for
you
just
because
you
do
know
your
multiplication
table
well
for
goodness
sakes
ejaculated
elizabeth
ann
feeling
very
much
as
though
somebody
had
stood
her
suddenly
on
her
head
why
what
the
matter
asked
the
teacher
again
this
time
elizabeth
ann
did
answer
because
she
herself
did
know
what
the
matter
was
but
i
do
and
i
tell
you
the
matter
was
that
never
before
had
she
known
what
she
was
doing
in
school
she
had
always
thought
she
was
there
to
pass
from
one
grade
to
another
and
she
was
ever
so
startled
to
get
a
little
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
she
was
there
to
learn
how
to
read
and
write
and
cipher
and
generally
use
her
mind
so
she
could
take
care
of
herself
when
she
came
to
be
grown
up
of
course
she
did
really
know
that
till
she
did
come
to
be
grown
up
but
she
had
her
first
dim
notion
of
it
in
that
moment
and
it
made
her
feel
the
way
you
do
when
you
learning
to
skate
and
somebody
pulls
away
the
chair
you
been
leaning
on
and
says
now
go
it
alone
the
teacher
waited
a
minute
and
then
when
elizabeth
ann
did
say
anything
more
she
rang
a
little
bell
recess
time
she
said
and
as
the
children
marched
out
and
began
putting
on
their
wraps
she
followed
them
into
the
pulled
on
a
warm
red
cap
and
a
red
sweater
and
ran
outdoors
herself
who
on
my
side
she
called
and
the
children
came
darting
out
after
her
elizabeth
ann
had
dreaded
the
first
recess
time
with
the
strange
children
but
she
had
no
time
to
feel
shy
for
in
a
twinkling
she
was
on
one
end
of
a
long
rope
with
a
lot
of
her
schoolmates
pulling
with
all
her
might
against
the
teacher
and
two
of
the
big
boys
nobody
had
looked
at
her
curiously
nobody
had
said
anything
to
her
beyond
a
loud
come
on
betsy
from
ralph
who
was
at
the
head
on
their
side
they
pulled
and
they
pulled
digging
their
feet
into
the
ground
and
bracing
themselves
against
the
rocks
which
stuck
up
out
of
the
playground
sometimes
the
teacher
side
yanked
them
along
by
quick
jerks
and
then
they
all
set
their
feet
hard
when
ralph
shouted
out
now
all
together
and
they
slowly
drag
the
other
side
back
and
all
the
time
everybody
was
shouting
and
yelling
together
with
the
excitement
betsy
was
screaming
too
and
when
a
wagon
passing
by
stopped
and
a
big
farmer
jumped
down
laughing
put
the
end
of
the
rope
over
his
shoulder
and
just
walked
off
with
the
whole
lot
of
them
till
he
had
pulled
them
clear
off
their
feet
elizabeth
ann
found
herself
rolling
over
and
over
with
a
breathless
squirming
mass
of
children
her
shrill
laughter
rising
even
above
the
shouts
of
merriment
of
the
others
she
laughed
so
she
could
hardly
get
up
on
her
feet
again
it
was
such
an
unexpected
ending
to
the
contest
the
big
farmer
was
laughing
too
you
ai
so
smart
as
you
think
you
are
are
you
he
jeered
at
them
then
he
started
yelling
whoa
there
to
his
horses
which
had
begun
to
walk
on
he
had
to
run
after
them
with
all
his
might
and
just
climbed
into
the
back
of
the
wagon
and
grabbed
the
reins
the
very
moment
they
broke
into
a
trot
the
children
laughed
and
ralph
shouted
after
him
hi
there
uncle
nate
who
not
so
smart
as
he
thinks
he
is
now
he
turned
to
the
little
girls
near
him
they
got
away
from
him
that
time
he
said
he
awful
foolish
about
leaving
them
standing
while
he
funning
or
something
he
thinks
he
awful
funny
anyhow
some
day
they
run
away
on
him
and
then
where
he
be
elizabeth
ann
was
thinking
to
herself
that
this
was
one
of
the
queerest
things
that
had
happened
to
her
even
in
this
queer
place
never
why
never
once
had
any
passing
the
playground
of
the
big
brick
building
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
stopping
for
a
minute
to
play
they
never
even
looked
at
the
children
any
more
than
if
they
were
in
another
world
in
fact
she
had
felt
the
school
was
in
another
world
ralph
it
your
turn
to
get
the
water
said
the
teacher
handing
him
a
pail
want
to
go
along
said
ralph
gruffly
to
ellen
and
betsy
he
led
the
way
and
the
little
girls
walked
after
him
now
that
she
was
out
of
a
crowd
elizabeth
ann
felt
all
her
shyness
come
down
on
her
like
a
black
cloud
drying
up
her
mouth
and
turning
her
hands
and
feet
cold
as
ice
into
one
of
these
cold
hands
she
felt
small
warm
fingers
slide
she
looked
down
and
there
was
little
molly
trotting
by
her
side
turning
her
blue
eyes
up
trustfully
teacher
says
i
can
go
with
you
if
take
care
of
me
she
said
she
never
lets
us
go
without
somebody
bigger
to
help
us
over
the
log
as
she
spoke
they
came
to
a
small
clear
swift
brook
crossed
by
a
big
log
elizabeth
ann
was
horribly
afraid
to
set
foot
on
it
but
with
little
molly
hand
holding
tightly
to
hers
she
was
ashamed
to
say
she
was
afraid
ralph
skipped
across
swinging
the
pail
to
show
how
easy
it
was
for
him
ellen
followed
more
slowly
and
then
oh
do
you
wish
aunt
frances
could
have
been
there
betsy
shut
her
teeth
together
hard
put
molly
ahead
of
her
took
her
hand
and
started
across
as
a
matter
of
fact
molly
went
along
as
as
a
little
goat
having
done
it
a
hundred
times
and
it
was
she
who
steadied
elizabeth
ann
but
nobody
knew
this
molly
least
of
all
ralph
took
a
drink
out
of
a
tin
cup
standing
on
a
stump
near
by
dipped
the
pail
into
a
deep
clear
pool
and
started
back
to
the
school
ellen
took
a
drink
and
offered
the
cup
to
betsy
very
shyly
without
looking
up
after
they
had
all
three
had
a
drink
they
stood
there
for
a
moment
much
embarrassed
then
ellen
said
in
a
very
small
voice
do
you
like
dolls
with
yellow
hair
the
best
now
it
happened
that
elizabeth
ann
had
very
positive
convictions
on
this
point
which
she
had
never
spoken
of
because
aunt
frances
did
really
care
about
dolls
she
only
pretended
to
to
be
company
for
her
little
niece
no
i
do
answered
the
little
girl
emphatically
i
get
just
sick
and
tired
of
always
seeing
them
with
that
old
hair
i
like
them
to
have
brown
hair
just
the
way
most
little
girls
really
do
ellen
lifted
her
eyes
and
smiled
radiantly
oh
so
do
i
she
said
and
that
lovely
old
doll
your
folks
have
has
got
brown
hair
will
you
let
me
play
with
her
some
time
my
folks
said
elizabeth
ann
blankly
why
yes
your
aunt
abigail
and
your
uncle
henry
have
they
got
a
doll
said
betsy
thinking
this
was
the
very
climax
of
putney
queerness
oh
my
yes
said
molly
eagerly
she
the
one
putney
had
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
she
got
the
loveliest
clothes
she
in
the
under
the
eaves
in
the
attic
they
let
me
take
her
down
once
when
i
was
there
with
mother
and
mother
said
she
guessed
now
a
little
girl

come
there
to
live

let
her
have

time

betsy
shut
her
teeth
together
hard
and
started
across
elizabeth
ann
had
not
understood
more
than
one
word
in
five
of
this
but
just
then
the
rang
and
they
went
back
little
molly
helping
elizabeth
ann
over
the
log
and
thinking
she
was
being
helped
as
before
they
ran
along
to
the
little
building
and
there
i
going
to
leave
them
because
i
think
i
told
enough
about
their
school
for
one
while
it
was
only
a
poor
rough
little
district
school
anyway
that
no
superintendent
of
schools
would
have
looked
at
for
a
minute
except
to
sniff

betsy
opened
the
door
and
was
greeted
by
her
kitten
who
ran
to
her
purring
and
arching
her
back
to
be
stroked
well
said
aunt
abigail
looking
up
from
the
pan
of
apples
in
her
lap
i
suppose
you
starved
are
you
get
yourself
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
why
do
you
and
have
one
of
these
apples
as
the
little
girl
sat
down
by
her
munching
fast
on
this
provender
she
asked
what
desk
did
you
get
elizabeth
ann
thought
for
a
moment
cuddling
eleanor
up
to
her
face
i
think
it
is
the
third
from
the
front
in
the
second
row
she
wondered
why
aunt
abigail
cared
oh
i
guess
that
your
uncle
henry
desk
it
the
one
his
father
had
too
are
there
a
couple
of
carved
on
it
betsy
nodded
his
father
carved
the
on
the
lid
so
henry
had
to
put
his
inside
i
remember
the
winter
he
put
it
there
it
was
the
first
season
mother
let
me
wear
real
hoop
skirts
i
sat
in
the
first
seat
on
the
third
row
betsy
ate
her
apple
more
and
more
slowly
trying
to
take
in
what
aunt
abigail
had
said
uncle
henry
and
his
father
why
moses
or
alexander
the
great
did
seem
any
further
back
in
the
mists
of
time
to
elizabeth
ann
than
did
uncle
henry
father
and
to
think
he
had
been
a
little
boy
right
there
at
that
desk
she
stopped
chewing
altogether
for
a
moment
and
stared
into
space
although
she
was
only
nine
years
old
she
was
feeling
a
little
of
the
same
rapt
wonder
the
same
astonished
sense
of
the
reality
of
the
people
who
have
gone
before
which
make
a
first
visit
to
the
roman
forum
such
a
thrilling
event
for
that
very
desk
after
a
moment
she
came
to
herself
and
finding
some
apple
still
in
her
mouth
went
on
chewing
meditatively
aunt
abigail
she
said
how
long
ago
was
that
let
see
said
the
old
woman
peeling
apples
with
wonderful
rapidity
i
was
born
in
and
i
was
six
when
i
first
went
to
school
years
ago
elizabeth
ann
like
all
little
girls
of
nine
had
very
little
notion
how
long
years
might
be
was
george
washington
alive
then
she
asked
the
wrinkles
around
aunt
abigail
eyes
deepened
mirthfully
but
she
did
not
laugh
as
she
answered
no
that
was
long
after
he
died
but
the
schoolhouse
was
there
when
he
was
alive
it
was
said
betsy
staring
with
her
teeth
set
deep
in
an
apple
yes
indeed
it
was
the
first
house
in
the
valley
built
of
sawed
lumber
you
know
when
our
folks
came
up
here
they
had
to
build
all
their
houses
of
logs
to
begin
with
they
did
cried
betsy
with
her
mouth
full
of
apple
why
yes
child
what
else
did
you
suppose
they
had
to
make
houses
out
of
they
had
to
have
something
to
live
in
right
off
the
sawmills
came
later
i
did
know
anything
about
it
said
betsy
tell
me
about
it
why
you
knew
did
you
your
aunt
harriet
must
have
told
you
about
how
our
folks
came
up
here
from
connecticut
in
on
horseback
connecticut
was
an
old
settled
place
then
compared
to
vermont
there
was
anything
here
but
trees
and
bears
and
i
heard
say
that
the
were
so
thick
you
could
go
out
after
dark
and
club
out
of
the
trees
just
like
hens
roosting
in
a
there
always
was
cold
in
the
pantry
just
the
way
we
have
doughnuts
and
they
used
to
grease
their
boots
and
their
hair
bears
were
so
plenty
it
sounds
like
good
eating
do
it
but
of
course
that
was
just
at
first
it
got
quite
settled
up
before
long
and
by
the
time
of
the
revolution
bears
were
getting
pretty
scarce
and
soon
the
were
all
gone
and
the
schoolhouse
that
schoolhouse
where
i
went
today
was
that
built
then
elizabeth
ann
found
it
hard
to
believe
yes
it
used
to
have
a
great
big
chimney
and
fireplace
in
it
it
was
built
long
before
stoves
were
invented
you
know
why
i
thought
stoves
were
always
invented
cried
elizabeth
ann
this
was
the
most
startling
and
interesting
conversation
she
had
ever
taken
part
in
aunt
abigail
laughed
mercy
no
child
why
can
remember
when
only
folks
that
were
pretty
well
off
had
stoves
and
real
poor
people
still
cooked
over
a
hearth
fire
i
always
thought
it
a
pity
they
tore
down
the
big
chimney
and
fireplace
out
of
the
schoolhouse
and
put
in
that
big
ugly
stove
but
folks
are
so
daft
over
things
well
anyhow
they
could
take
away
the
on
the
you
want
to
be
sure
to
look
at
that
it
on
the
sill
of
the
middle
window
on
the
right
hand
as
you
face
the
teacher
desk
repeated
betsy
what
that
why
to
tell
the
time
by
when
why
did
they
have
a
clock
asked
the
child
aunt
abigail
laughed
good
gracious
there
was
only
one
clock
in
the
valley
for
years
and
years
and
that
belonged
to
the
wardons
the
rich
people
in
the
village
everybody
had
cut
in
their
there
one
on
the
of
our
pantry
this
minute
come
on
i
show
it
to
you
she
got
up
heavily
with
her
pan
of
apples
and
trotted
briskly
shaking
the
floor
as
she
went
over
to
the
stove
but
first
just
watch
me
put
these
on
to
cook
so
you
know
how
she
set
the
pan
on
the
stove
poured
some
water
from
the
over
the
apples
and
put
on
a
cover
now
come
on
into
the
pantry
they
entered
a
spicy
little
room
all
white
paint
and
shelves
which
were
loaded
with
dishes
and
boxes
and
bags
and
pans
of
milk
and
jars
of
preserves
there
said
aunt
abigail
opening
the
window
that
not
so
good
as
the
one
at
school
this
only
tells
when
noon
is
elizabeth
ann
stared
stupidly
at
the
deep
scratch
on
the
do
you
see
said
aunt
abigail
when
the
shadow
got
to
that
mark
it
was
noon
and
the
rest
of
the
time
you
guessed
by
how
far
it
was
from
the
mark
let
see
if
i
can
come
anywhere
near
it
now
she
looked
at
it
hard
and
said
i
guess
it
four
she
glanced
back
into
the
kitchen
at
the
clock
and
said
oh
pshaw
it
ten
minutes
past
five
now
my
grandmother
could
have
told
that
within
five
minutes
just
by
the
place
of
the
shadow
i
declare
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
every
time
a
new
piece
of
machinery
comes
into
the
door
some
of
our
wits
fly
out
at
the
window
now
i
could
any
more
live
without
matches
than
i
could
fly
and
yet
they
all
used
to
get
along
all
right
before
they
had
matches
makes
me
feel
foolish
to
think
i
not
smart
enough
to
get
along
if
i
wanted
to
without
those
little
snips
of
pine
and
brimstone
here
betsy
take
a
cooky
it
against
my
principles
to
let
a
child
leave
the
pantry
without
having
a
cooky
my
it
does
seem
like
living
again
to
have
a
young
one
around
to
stuff
betsy
took
the
cooky
but
went
on
with
the
conversation
by
exclaiming
how
could
get
along
without
matches
you
have
to
have
matches
aunt
abigail
did
answer
at
first
they
were
back
in
the
kitchen
now
she
was
looking
at
the
clock
again
see
here
she
said
it
time
i
began
getting
supper
ready
we
divide
up
on
the
work
ann
gets
the
dinner
and
i
get
the
supper
and
everybody
gets
his
own
breakfast
which
would
you
rather
do
help
ann
with
the
dinner
or
me
with
the
supper
elizabeth
ann
had
not
had
the
slightest
idea
of
helping
anybody
with
any
meal
but
confronted
unexpectedly
with
the
alternative
offered
she
made
up
her
mind
so
quickly
that
she
did
want
to
help
cousin
ann
and
declared
so
loudly
oh
help
you
with
the
supper
that
her
promptness
made
her
sound
quite
hearty
and
willing
well
that
fine
said
aunt
abigail
we
set
the
table
now
but
first
you
would
better
look
at
that
apple
sauce
i
hear
it
walloping
away
as
though
it
was
boiling
too
fast
maybe
you
better
push
it
back
where
it
wo
cook
so
fast
there
are
the
holders
on
that
hook
elizabeth
ann
approached
the
stove
with
the
holder
in
her
hand
and
horror
in
her
heart
nobody
had
ever
dreamed
of
asking
her
to
handle
hot
things
she
looked
around
dismally
at
aunt
abigail
but
the
old
woman
was
standing
with
her
back
turned
doing
something
at
the
kitchen
table
very
gingerly
the
little
girl
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
saucepan
and
very
gingerly
she
shoved
it
to
the
back
of
the
stove
and
then
she
stood
still
a
moment
to
admire
herself
she
could
do
that
as
well
as
anybody
why
said
aunt
abigail
as
if
remembering
that
betsy
had
asked
her
a
question
any
man
could
strike
a
spark
from
his
flint
and
steel
that
he
had
for
his
gun
and
he
keep
striking
it
till
it
happened
to
fly
out
in
the
right
direction
and
you
catch
it
in
some
fluff
where
it
would
start
a
smoulder
and
you
blow
on
it
till
you
got
a
little
flame
and
drop
tiny
bits
of
dry
pine
in
it
and
so
little
by
little
you
build
your
fire
up
but
it
must
have
taken
forever
to
do
that
oh
you
did
have
to
do
that
more
than
once
in
ever
so
long
said
aunt
abigail
briskly
she
interrupted
her
story
to
say
now
you
put
the
silver
around
while
i
cream
the
potatoes
it
in
that
drawer
a
knife
a
fork
and
two
spoons
for
each
place
and
the
plates
and
cups
are
up
there
behind
the
glass
doors
we
going
to
have
hot
cocoa
again
tonight
and
as
the
little
girl
hypnotized
by
the
other
casual
offhand
way
of
issuing
instructions
began
to
fumble
with
the
knives
and
forks
she
went
on
why
you
start
your
fire
that
way
and
then
never
let
it
go
out
everybody
that
amounted
to
anything
knew
how
to
bank
the
hearth
fire
with
ashes
at
night
so
it
would
be
sure
to
last
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
you
got
down
on
your
knees
and
poked
the
ashes
away
very
carefully
till
you
got
to
the
hot
coals
then
blow
with
the
bellows
and
drop
in
pieces
of
dry
pine
do
forget
the
and
you
blow
gently
till
they
flared
up
and
the
shavings
caught
and
there
your
fire
would
be
kindled
again
the
napkins
are
in
the
second
drawer
betsy
went
on
setting
the
table
deep
in
thought
reconstructing
the
old
life
as
she
put
the
napkins
around
she
said
but
sometimes
it
must
have
gone
out
yes
said
aunt
abigail
sometimes
it
went
out
and
then
one
of
the
children
was
sent
over
to
the
nearest
neighbor
to
borrow
some
fire
take
a
covered
iron
pan
fastened
on
to
a
long
hickory
stick
and
go
through
the
woods
everything
was
woods
then
to
the
next
house
and
wait
till
they
had
their
fire
going
and
could
spare
him
a
pan
full
of
coals
and
then
do
forget
the
salt
and
pepper
he
would
leg
it
home
as
fast
as
he
could
streak
it
to
get
there
before
the
coals
went
out
say
betsy
i
think
that
apple
sauce
is
ready
to
be
sweetened
you
do
it
will
you
i
got
my
hands
in
the
biscuit
dough
the
sugar
in
the
drawer
in
the
kitchen
cabinet
oh
my
cried
betsy
dismayed
do
know
how
to
cook
aunt
abigail
laughed
and
put
back
a
strand
of
curly
white
hair
with
the
back
of
her
floury
hand
you
know
how
to
stir
sugar
into
your
cup
of
cocoa
do
you
but
how
much
shall
i
put
in
asked
elizabeth
ann
clamoring
for
exact
instruction
so
she
would
need
to
do
any
thinking
for
herself
oh
till
it
tastes
right
said
aunt
abigail
carelessly
fix
it
to
suit
yourself
and
i
guess
the
rest
of
us
will
like
it
take
that
big
spoon
to
stir
it
with
elizabeth
ann
took
off
the
lid
and
began
stirring
in
sugar
a
teaspoonful
at
a
time
but
she
soon
saw
that
that
made
no
impression
she
poured
in
a
cupful
stirred
it
vigorously
and
tasted
it
better
but
not
quite
enough
she
put
in
a
tablespoonful
more
and
tasted
it
staring
off
into
space
under
bended
brows
as
she
concentrated
her
attention
on
the
taste
it
was
quite
a
responsibility
to
prepare
the
apple
sauce
for
a
family
it
was
ever
so
good
too
but
maybe
a
little
more
sugar
she
put
in
a
teaspoonful
and
decided
it
was
just
exactly
right
done
asked
aunt
abigail
take
it
off
then
and
pour
it
out
in
that
big
yellow
bowl
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
your
place
made
it
you
ought
to
serve
it
it
is
done
is
it
asked
betsy
that
is
all
you
do
to
make
apple
sauce
what
else
could
you
do
asked
aunt
abigail
well
said
elizabeth
ann
very
much
surprised
i
did
know
it
was
so
easy
to
cook
easiest
thing
in
the
world
said
aunt
abigail
gravely
with
the
merry
wrinkles
around
her
merry
old
eyes
all
creased
up
with
silent
fun
when
uncle
henry
came
in
from
the
barn
with
old
shep
at
his
heels
and
cousin
ann
came
down
from
upstairs
where
her
had
been
humming
like
a
big
bee
they
were
both
duly
impressed
when
told
that
betsy
had
set
the
table
and
made
the
apple
sauce
they
pronounced
it
very
good
apple
sauce
indeed
and
each
sent
his
saucer
back
to
the
little
girl
for
a
second
helping
she
herself
ate
three
saucerfuls
her
own
private
opinion
was
that
it
was
the
very
best
apple
sauce
ever
made
after
supper
was
over
and
the
dishes
washed
and
wiped
betsy
helping
with
the
the
four
gathered
around
the
big
lamp
on
the
table
with
the
red
cover
cousin
ann
was
making
some
buttonholes
in
the
she
had
constructed
that
afternoon
aunt
abigail
was
darning
socks
and
uncle
henry
was
mending
a
piece
of
harness
shep
lay
on
the
couch
and
snored
until
he
got
so
noisy
they
could
stand
it
and
cousin
ann
poked
him
in
the
ribs
and
he
woke
up
snorting
and
gurgling
and
looking
around
very
sheepishly
every
time
this
happened
it
made
betsy
laugh
she
held
eleanor
who
did
snore
at
all
but
made
the
prettiest
little
purr
deep
in
her
throat
and
opened
and
sheathed
her
claws
in
betsy
dress
well
how
you
get
on
at
school
asked
uncle
henry
i
got
your
desk
said
elizabeth
ann
looking
at
him
curiously
at
his
gray
hair
and
wrinkled
face
and
trying
to
think
what
he
must
have
looked
like
when
he
was
a
little
boy
like
ralph
so
said
uncle
henry
well
let
me
tell
you
that
a
mighty
good
desk
did
you
notice
the
deep
groove
in
the
top
of
it
betsy
nodded
she
had
wondered
what
that
was
used
for
well
that
was
the
desk
in
the
old
days
when
they
run
down
to
the
store
to
buy
things
because
there
was
any
store
to
run
to
how
do
you
suppose
they
got
their
elizabeth
ann
shook
her
head
incapable
even
of
a
guess
she
had
never
thought
before
but
that
grew
in
glass
in
stores
well
sir
said
uncle
henry
i
tell
you
they
took
a
piece
off
the
lump
of
lead
they
made
their
bullets
of
melted
it
over
the
fire
in
the
hearth
down
at
the
schoolhouse
till
it
would
run
like
water
and
poured
it
in
that
groove
when
it
cooled
off
there
was
a
long
streak
of
solid
lead
about
as
big
as
one
of
our
nowadays
they
break
that
up
in
shorter
lengths
and
there
you
have
your
made
while
you
wait
oh
i
tell
you
in
the
old
days
folks
knew
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
more
than
now
why
were
there
any
stores
asked
elizabeth
ann
she
could
not
imagine
living
without
buying
things
at
stores
where
they
get
the
things
to
put
in
a
store
in
those
days
asked
uncle
henry
argumentatively
every
single
thing
had
to
be
lugged
clear
from
albany
or
from
connecticut
on
horseback
why
did
they
use
wagons
asked
elizabeth
ann
you
ca
run
a
wagon
unless
you
got
a
road
to
run
it
on
can
you
asked
uncle
henry
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
they
had
any
roads
it
an
awful
chore
to
make
roads
in
a
new
country
all
woods
and
hills
and
swamps
and
rocks
you
were
lucky
if
there
was
a
good
path
from
your
house
to
the
next
settlement
now
henry
said
aunt
abigail
do
stop
going
on
about
old
times
long
enough
to
let
betsy
answer
the
question
you
asked
her
you
have
given
her
a
chance
to
say
how
she
got
on
at
school
well
i
awfully
mixed
up
said
betsy
complainingly
i
do
know
what
i
am
i
arithmetic
and
spelling
and
reading
and
i
do
know
what
in
writing
or
composition
we
did
have
those
nobody
seemed
to
think
this
very
remarkable
or
even
very
interesting
uncle
henry
indeed
noted
it
only
to
say
reading
he
turned
to
aunt
abigail
oh
mother
do
you
suppose
she
could
read
aloud
to
us
evenings
aunt
abigail
and
cousin
ann
both
laid
down
their
sewing
to
laugh
yes
yes
father
and
play
checkers
with
you
too
like
as
not
they
explained
to
betsy
your
uncle
henry
is
just
daft
on
being
read
aloud
to
when
he
got
something
to
do
in
the
evening
and
when
he
has
as
fidgety
as
a
broody
hen
if
he
ca
play
checkers
ann
hates
checkers
and
i
have
got
the
time
often
oh
i
love
to
play
checkers
said
betsy
well
now
said
uncle
henry
rising
instantly
and
dropping
his
harness
on
the
table
let
have
a
game
oh
father
said
cousin
ann
in
the
tone
she
used
for
shep
how
about
that
piece
of
breeching
you
know
that
not
safe
why
do
you
finish
that
up
first
uncle
henry
sat
down
again
looking
as
shep
did
when
cousin
ann
told
him
to
get
up
on
the
couch
and
took
up
his
needle
and
awl
but
i
could
read
something
aloud
said
betsy
feeling
very
sorry
for
him
at
least
i
think
i
could
i
never
did
except
at
school
what
shall
we
have
mother
asked
uncle
henry
eagerly
oh
i
do
know
what
have
we
got
in
this
bookcase
said
aunt
abigail
it
pretty
cold
to
go
into
the
parlor
to
the
other
one
she
leaned
forward
ran
her
fat
over
the
worn
old
volumes
and
took
out
a
battered
book
scott
gosh
yes
said
uncle
henry
his
eyes
shining
the
staggit
eve
at
least
that
was
the
way
it
sounded
to
betsy
but
when
she
took
the
book
and
looked
where
aunt
abigail
pointed
she
read
it
correctly
though
in
a
timid
uncertain
voice
she
was
very
proud
to
think
she
could
please
a
so
much
as
she
was
evidently
pleasing
uncle
henry
but
the
idea
of
reading
aloud
for
people
to
hear
not
for
a
teacher
to
correct
was
the
stag
at
eve
had
drunk
his
fill
where
danced
the
moon
on
monan
rill
she
began
and
it
was
as
though
she
had
stepped
into
a
boat
and
was
swept
off
by
a
strong
current
she
did
not
know
what
all
the
words
meant
and
she
could
not
pronounce
a
good
many
of
the
names
but
nobody
interrupted
to
correct
her
and
she
read
on
and
on
steadied
by
the
rhythm
drawn
forward
swiftly
from
one
clanging
sonorous
rhyme
to
another
uncle
henry
nodded
his
head
in
time
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
voice
and
now
and
then
stopped
his
work
to
look
at
her
with
bright
eager
old
eyes
he
knew
some
of
the
places
by
heart
evidently
for
once
in
a
while
his
voice
would
join
the
little
for
a
couplet
or
two
they
chanted
together
thus
a
moment
listened
to
the
cry
that
thickened
as
the
chase
drew
nigh
then
as
the
headmost
foes
appeared
with
one
brave
bound
the
copse
he
cleared
at
the
last
line
uncle
henry
flung
his
arm
out
wide
and
the
child
felt
as
though
the
deer
had
made
his
great
leap
there
before
her
eyes
i
seen
jump
just
like
that
broke
in
uncle
henry
a
stag
go
up
over
a
fence
just
like
a
piece
of
thistledown
in
the
wind
uncle
henry
asked
elizabeth
ann
what
is
a
copse
i
do
know
said
uncle
henry
indifferently
something
in
the
woods
must
be
underbrush
most
likely
you
can
always
tell
words
you
know
by
the
sense
of
the
whole
thing
go
on
and
stretching
forward
free
and
far
the
child
voice
took
up
the
chant
again
she
read
faster
and
faster
as
it
got
more
exciting
uncle
henry
joined
in
on
for
jaded
now
and
spent
with
toil
embossed
with
foam
and
dark
with
soil
while
every
gasp
with
sobs
he
drew
the
laboring
stag
strained
full
in
view
the
little
girl
heart
beat
fast
she
fled
along
through
the
next
lines
stumbling
desperately
over
the
hard
words
but
seeing
the
headlong
chase
through
them
clearly
as
through
in
a
forest
uncle
henry
broke
in
in
a
triumphant
shout
the
wily
quarry
shunned
the
shock
and
turned
him
from
the
opposing
rock
then
dashing
down
a
darksome
glen
soon
lost
to
hound
and
hunter
ken
in
the
deep
trossach
wildest
nook
his
solitary
refuge
took
oh
my
cried
elizabeth
ann
laying
down
the
book
he
got
away
he
i
was
so
afraid
he
would
i
can
just
hear
those
dogs
yelping
ca
you
said
uncle
henry
yelled
on
the
view
the
opening
pack
sometimes
you
hear
that
way
up
on
the
slope
of
hemlock
mountain
back
of
us
when
they
get
to
running
a
deer
what
say
we
have
some
suggested
aunt
abigail
betsy
you
want
to
pop
us
some
i
never
did
said
the
little
girl
but
in
a
less
doubtful
tone
than
she
had
ever
used
with
that
phrase
so
familiar
to
her
a
dim
notion
was
growing
up
in
her
mind
that
the
fact
that
she
had
never
done
a
thing
was
no
proof
that
she
could
i
show
you
said
uncle
henry
he
reached
down
a
couple
of
ears
from
a
big
yellow
cluster
hanging
on
the
wall
and
he
and
betsy
shelled
them
into
the
popper
popped
it
full
of
snowy
kernels
buttered
it
salted
it
and
took
it
back
to
the
table
it
was
just
as
she
was
eating
her
first
ambrosial
mouthful
that
the
door
opened
and
a
head
was
thrust
in
a
man
voice
said
evenin
folks
no
i
ca
stay
i
was
down
at
the
village
just
now
and
thought
i
ask
for
any
mail
down
our
way
he
tossed
a
newspaper
and
a
letter
on
the
table
and
was
gone
the
letter
was
addressed
to
elizabeth
ann
and
it
was
from
aunt
frances
she
read
it
to
herself
while
uncle
henry
read
the
newspaper
aunt
frances
wrote
that
she
had
been
perfectly
horrified
to
learn
that
cousin
molly
had
not
kept
elizabeth
ann
with
her
and
that
she
would
never
forgive
her
for
that
cruelty
and
when
she
thought
that
her
darling
was
at
putney
farm
her
blood
ran
cold
it
positively
did
it
was
too
dreadful
but
it
could
be
helped
for
a
time
anyhow
because
aunt
harriet
was
really
very
sick
elizabeth
ann
would
have
to
be
a
dear
brave
child
and
endure
it
as
best
she
could
and
as
soon
oh
as
soon
as
ever
she
could
aunt
frances
would
come
and
take
her
away
from
them
do
cry
too
much
darling
it
breaks
my
heart
to
think
of
you
there
try
to
be
cheerful
dearest
try
to
bear
it
for
the
sake
of
your
distracted
loving
aunt
frances
elizabeth
ann
looked
up
from
this
letter
and
across
the
table
at
aunt
abigail
rosy
wrinkled
old
face
bent
over
her
darning
uncle
henry
laid
the
paper
down
took
a
big
mouthful
of
and
beat
time
silently
with
his
hand
when
he
could
speak
he
murmured
an
hundred
dogs
bayed
deep
and
strong
clattered
an
hundred
steeds
along
old
shep
woke
up
with
a
snort
and
aunt
abigail
fed
him
a
handful
of
little
eleanor
stirred
in
her
sleep
stretched
yawned
and
nestled
down
into
a
ball
again
on
the
little
girl
lap
betsy
could
feel
in
her
own
body
the
rhythmic
vibration
of
the
kitten
contented
purr
aunt
abigail
looked
up
finished
your
letter
i
hope
harriet
is
no
worse
what
does
frances
say
elizabeth
ann
blushed
a
deep
red
and
crushed
the
letter
together
in
her
hand
she
felt
ashamed
and
she
did
not
know
why
aunt
frances
says
aunt
frances
says
she
began
hesitating
she
says
aunt
harriet
is
still
pretty
sick
she
stopped
drew
a
long
breath
and
went
on
and
she
sends
her
love
to
you
now
aunt
frances
had
done
anything
of
the
kind
so
this
was
a
really
whopping
fib
but
elizabeth
ann
did
care
if
it
was
it
made
her
feel
less
ashamed
though
she
did
not
know
why
she
took
another
mouthful
of
and
stroked
eleanor
back
uncle
henry
got
up
and
stretched
it
time
to
go
to
bed
folks
he
said
as
he
wound
the
clock
betsy
heard
him
murmuring
but
when
the
sun
his
beacon
red
chapter
vii
elizabeth
ann
fails
in
an
examination
i
wonder
if
you
can
guess
the
name
of
a
little
girl
who
about
a
month
after
this
was
walking
along
through
the
melting
snow
in
the
woods
with
a
big
black
dog
running
circles
around
her
yes
all
alone
in
the
woods
with
a
terrible
great
dog
beside
her
and
yet
not
a
bit
afraid
you
do
suppose
it
could
be
elizabeth
ann
well
whoever
she
was
she
had
something
on
her
mind
for
she
walked
more
and
more
slowly
and
had
only
a
very
pat
for
the
dog
head
when
he
thrust
it
up
for
a
caress
when
the
wood
road
led
into
a
clearing
in
which
there
was
a
rough
little
house
of
slabs
the
child
stopped
altogether
and
looking
down
began
nervously
to
draw
lines
in
the
snow
with
her
overshoe
you
see
something
perfectly
dreadful
had
happened
in
school
that
day
the
superintendent
the
superintendent
came
to
visit
the
school
and
the
children
were
given
some
examinations
so
he
could
see
how
they
were
getting
on
now
you
know
what
an
examination
did
to
elizabeth
ann
or
have
i
told
you
yet
well
if
i
have
it
because
words
fail
me
if
there
is
anything
horrid
that
an
examination
did
do
to
elizabeth
ann
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
it
it
began
years
ago
before
ever
she
went
to
school
when
she
heard
aunt
frances
talking
about
how
she
had
dreaded
examinations
when
she
was
a
child
and
how
they
dried
up
her
mouth
and
made
her
ears
ring
and
her
head
ache
and
her
knees
get
all
weak
and
her
mind
a
perfect
blank
so
that
she
did
know
what
two
and
two
made
of
course
elizabeth
ann
did
feel
all
those
things
right
off
at
her
first
examination
but
by
the
time
she
had
had
several
and
had
rushed
to
tell
aunt
frances
about
how
awful
they
were
and
the
two
of
them
had
sympathized
with
one
another
and
compared
symptoms
and
then
wept
about
her
resulting
low
marks
why
she
not
only
had
all
the
symptoms
aunt
frances
had
ever
had
but
a
good
many
more
of
her
own
invention
well
she
had
had
them
all
and
had
them
hard
this
afternoon
when
the
superintendent
was
there
her
mouth
had
gone
dry
and
her
knees
had
shaken
and
her
elbows
had
felt
as
though
they
had
no
more
bones
in
them
than
so
much
jelly
and
her
eyes
had
smarted
and
oh
what
answers
she
had
made
that
dreadful
tight
panic
had
clutched
at
her
throat
whenever
the
superintendent
had
looked
at
her
and
she
had
disgraced
herself
ten
times
over
she
went
hot
and
cold
to
think
of
it
and
felt
quite
sick
with
hurt
vanity
she
who
did
so
well
every
day
and
was
so
much
looked
up
to
by
her
classmates
what
must
they
be
thinking
of
her
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
been
crying
as
she
walked
along
through
the
woods
because
she
was
so
sorry
for
herself
her
eyes
were
all
red
still
and
her
throat
sore
from
the
big
lump
in
it
and
now
she
would
live
it
all
over
again
as
she
told
the
putney
cousins
for
of
course
they
must
be
told
she
had
always
told
aunt
frances
everything
that
happened
in
school
it
happened
that
aunt
abigail
had
been
taking
a
nap
when
she
got
home
from
school
and
so
she
had
come
out
to
the
where
cousin
ann
and
uncle
henry
were
making
syrup
to
have
it
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
she
went
up
to
the
little
slab
house
now
dragging
her
feet
and
hanging
her
head
and
opened
the
door
cousin
ann
in
a
very
short
old
skirt
and
a
man
coat
and
high
rubber
boots
was
just
poking
some
more
wood
into
the
big
fire
which
blazed
furiously
under
the
broad
flat
pan
where
the
sap
was
boiling
the
rough
brown
hut
was
filled
with
white
steam
and
that
sweetest
of
all
odors
hot
maple
syrup
cousin
ann
turned
her
head
her
face
very
red
with
the
heat
of
the
fire
and
nodded
at
the
child
hello
betsy
you
just
in
time
i
saved
out
a
cupful
of
hot
syrup
for
you
all
ready
to
wax
betsy
hardly
heard
this
although
she
had
been
wild
about
waxed
sugar
on
snow
ever
since
her
very
first
taste
of
it
cousin
ann
she
said
unhappily
the
superintendent
visited
our
school
this
afternoon
did
he
said
cousin
ann
dipping
a
thermometer
into
the
boiling
syrup
yes
and
we
had
examinations
said
betsy
did
you
said
cousin
ann
holding
the
thermometer
up
to
the
light
and
looking
at
it
and
you
know
how
perfectly
awful
examinations
make
you
feel
said
betsy
very
near
to
tears
again
why
no
said
cousin
ann
sorting
over
syrup
tins
they
never
made
me
feel
awful
i
thought
they
were
sort
of
fun
fun
cried
betsy
indignantly
staring
through
the
beginnings
of
her
tears
why
yes
like
taking
a
dare
do
you
know
somebody
stumps
you
to
jump
off
the
and
you
do
it
to
show
i
always
used
to
think
examinations
were
like
that
somebody
stumps
you
to
spell
and
you
do
it
to
show
here
your
cup
of
syrup
better
go
right
out
and
wax
it
while
it
hot
elizabeth
ann
automatically
took
the
cup
in
her
hand
but
she
did
not
look
at
it
but
supposing
you
get
so
scared
you
ca
spell
or
anything
else
she
said
feelingly
that
what
happened
to
me
you
know
how
your
mouth
gets
all
dry
and
your
knees
she
stopped
cousin
ann
had
said
she
did
not
know
all
about
those
things
well
anyhow
i
got
so
scared
i
could
hardly
stand
up
and
i
made
the
most
awful
mistakes
things
i
know
just
as
well
i
spelled
without
any
b
and
with
an
e
and
i
said
iowa
was
bounded
on
the
north
by
wisconsin
and
i
oh
well
said
cousin
ann
it
does
matter
if
you
really
know
the
right
answers
does
it
that
the
important
thing
this
was
an
idea
which
had
never
in
all
her
life
entered
betsy
brain
and
she
did
not
take
it
in
at
all
now
she
only
shook
her
head
miserably
and
went
on
in
a
doleful
tone
and
i
said
and
are
and
i
wrote
march
without
any
capital
m
and
i
look
here
betsy
do
you
want
to
tell
me
all
this
cousin
ann
spoke
in
the
quick
ringing
voice
she
had
once
in
a
while
which
made
everybody
from
old
shep
up
open
his
eyes
and
get
his
wits
about
him
betsy
gathered
hers
and
thought
hard
and
she
came
to
an
unexpected
conclusion
no
she
did
really
want
to
tell
cousin
ann
all
about
it
why
was
she
doing
it
because
she
thought
that
was
the
thing
to
do
because
if
you
do
really
want
to
went
on
cousin
ann
i
do
see
that
it
doing
anybody
any
good
i
guess
hemlock
mountain
will
stand
right
there
just
the
same
even
if
you
did
forget
to
put
a
b
in
and
your
syrup
will
be
too
cool
to
wax
right
if
you
do
take
it
out
pretty
soon
she
turned
back
to
stoke
the
fire
and
elizabeth
ann
in
a
daze
found
herself
walking
out
of
the
door
it
fell
shut
after
her
and
there
she
was
under
the
clear
sky
with
the
sun
just
hovering
over
the
rim
of
hemlock
mountain
she
looked
up
at
the
big
mountains
all
blue
and
silver
with
shadows
and
snow
and
wondered
what
in
the
world
cousin
ann
had
meant
of
course
hemlock
mountain
would
stand
there
just
the
same
but
what
of
it
what
did
that
have
to
do
with
her
arithmetic
with
anything
she
had
failed
in
her
examination
had
she
she
found
a
clean
white
under
a
and
setting
her
cup
of
syrup
down
in
a
safe
place
began
to
pat
the
snow
down
hard
to
make
the
right
bed
for
the
waxing
of
the
syrup
the
sun
very
hot
for
that
late
march
day
brought
out
strongly
the
tarry
perfume
of
the
big
near
her
the
sap
dripped
musically
into
a
bucket
already
half
full
hung
on
a
a
rushed
suddenly
through
the
upper
branches
of
the
wood
his
screaming
and
chattering
voice
sounding
like
noisy
children
at
play
elizabeth
ann
took
up
her
cup
and
poured
some
of
the
thick
hot
syrup
out
on
the
hard
snow
making
loops
and
curves
as
she
poured
it
stiffened
and
hardened
at
once
and
she
lifted
up
a
great
coil
of
it
threw
her
head
back
and
let
it
drop
into
her
mouth
concentrated
sweetness
of
summer
days
was
in
that
mouthful
part
of
it
still
hot
and
aromatic
part
of
it
icy
and
wet
with
melting
snow
she
crunched
it
all
together
with
her
strong
child
teeth
into
a
delicious
big
lump
and
sucked
on
it
dreamily
her
eyes
on
the
rim
of
hemlock
mountain
high
above
her
there
the
snow
on
it
bright
golden
in
the
sunlight
uncle
henry
had
promised
to
take
her
up
to
the
top
as
soon
as
the
snow
went
off
she
wondered
what
the
top
of
a
mountain
would
be
like
uncle
henry
had
said
the
main
thing
was
that
you
could
see
so
much
of
the
world
at
once
he
said
it
was
too
queer
the
way
your
own
house
and
big
barn
and
great
fields
looked
like
little
toy
things
that
were
of
any
account
it
was
because
you
could
see
so
much
more
than
just
the
she
heard
an
imploring
whine
and
a
cold
nose
was
thrust
into
her
hand
why
there
was
old
shep
begging
for
his
share
of
waxed
sugar
he
loved
it
though
it
did
stick
to
his
teeth
so
she
poured
out
another
lot
and
gave
half
of
it
to
shep
it
immediately
stuck
his
jaws
together
tight
and
he
began
pawing
at
his
mouth
and
shaking
his
head
till
betsy
had
to
laugh
then
he
managed
to
pull
his
jaws
apart
and
chewed
loudly
and
visibly
tossing
his
head
opening
his
mouth
wide
till
betsy
could
see
the
sticky
brown
candy
draped
in
melting
festoons
all
over
his
big
white
teeth
and
red
gullet
then
with
a
gulp
he
had
swallowed
it
all
down
and
was
whining
for
more
striking
softly
at
the
little
skirt
with
his
forepaw
oh
you
eat
it
too
fast
cried
betsy
but
she
shared
her
next
lot
with
him
too
the
sun
had
gone
down
over
hemlock
mountain
by
this
time
and
the
big
slope
above
her
was
all
deep
blue
shadow
the
mountain
looked
much
higher
now
as
the
dusk
began
to
fall
and
loomed
up
bigger
and
bigger
as
though
it
reached
to
the
sky
it
was
no
wonder
houses
looked
small
from
its
top
betsy
ate
the
last
of
her
sugar
looking
up
at
the
quiet
giant
there
towering
grandly
above
her
there
was
no
lump
in
her
throat
now
and
although
she
still
thought
she
did
not
know
what
in
the
world
cousin
ann
meant
by
saying
that
about
hemlock
mountain
and
her
examination
it
my
opinion
that
she
had
made
a
very
good
beginning
of
an
understanding
she
was
just
picking
up
her
cup
to
take
it
back
to
the
when
shep
growled
a
little
and
stood
with
his
ears
and
tail
up
looking
down
the
road
something
was
coming
down
that
road
in
the
blue
clear
twilight
something
that
was
making
a
very
queer
noise
it
sounded
almost
like
somebody
crying
it
was
somebody
crying
it
was
a
child
crying
it
was
a
little
little
girl
betsy
could
see
her
now
stumbling
along
and
crying
as
though
her
heart
would
break
why
it
was
little
molly
her
own
particular
charge
at
school
whose
reading
lesson
she
heard
every
day
betsy
and
shep
ran
to
meet
her
what
the
matter
molly
what
the
matter
betsy
knelt
down
and
put
her
arms
around
the
weeping
child
did
you
fall
down
did
you
hurt
you
what
are
you
doing
off
here
did
you
lose
your
way
i
do
want
to
go
away
i
do
want
to
go
away
said
molly
over
and
over
clinging
tightly
to
betsy
it
was
a
long
time
before
betsy
could
quiet
her
enough
to
find
out
what
had
happened
then
she
made
out
between
molly
sobs
that
her
mother
had
been
taken
suddenly
sick
and
had
to
go
away
to
a
hospital
and
that
left
nobody
at
home
to
take
care
of
molly
and
she
was
to
be
sent
away
to
some
strange
relatives
in
the
city
who
did
want
her
at
all
and
who
said
so
right
out
oh
elizabeth
ann
knew
all
about
that
and
her
heart
swelled
big
with
sympathy
for
a
moment
she
stood
again
out
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
lathrop
house
with
old
lathrop
ungracious
white
head
bobbing
from
a
window
and
knew
again
that
ghastly
feeling
of
being
unwanted
oh
she
knew
why
little
molly
was
crying
and
she
shut
her
hands
together
hard
and
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
help
her
out
illustration
what
the
matter
molly
what
the
matter
do
you
know
what
she
did
right
off
without
thinking
about
it
she
did
go
and
look
up
aunt
abigail
she
did
wait
till
uncle
henry
came
back
from
his
round
of
emptying
sap
buckets
into
the
big
tub
on
his
sled
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
she
flew
back
to
cousin
ann
in
the
i
ca
tell
you
except
again
that
cousin
ann
was
cousin
ann
why
it
was
that
betsy
ran
so
fast
to
her
and
was
so
sure
that
everything
would
be
all
right
as
soon
as
cousin
ann
knew
about
it
but
whatever
the
reason
was
it
was
a
good
one
for
though
cousin
ann
did
not
stop
to
kiss
molly
or
even
to
look
at
her
more
than
one
sharp
first
glance
she
said
after
a
moment
pause
during
which
she
filled
a
syrup
can
and
screwed
the
cover
down
very
tight
well
if
her
folks
will
let
her
stay
how
would
you
like
to
have
molly
come
and
stay
with
us
till
her
mother
gets
back
from
the
hospital
now
you
got
a
room
of
your
own
i
guess
if
you
wanted
to
you
could
have
her
sleep
with
you
oh
molly
molly
molly
shouted
betsy
jumping
up
and
down
and
then
hugging
the
little
girl
with
all
her
might
oh
it
will
be
like
having
a
little
sister
cousin
ann
sounded
a
dry
warning
note
do
be
too
sure
her
folks
will
let
her
we
do
know
about
them
yet
betsy
ran
to
her
and
caught
her
hand
looking
up
at
her
with
shining
eyes
cousin
ann
if
you
go
to
see
them
and
ask
them
they
will
this
made
even
cousin
ann
give
a
little
abashed
smile
of
pleasure
although
she
made
her
face
grave
again
at
once
and
said
you
better
go
along
back
to
the
house
now
betsy
it
time
for
you
to
help
mother
with
the
supper
the
two
children
trotted
back
along
the
darkening
wood
road
shep
running
before
them
little
molly
clinging
fast
to
the
older
hand
are
you
ever
afraid
betsy
in
the
woods
this
way
she
asked
admiringly
looking
about
her
with
timid
eyes
oh
no
said
betsy
protectingly
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
except
getting
off
on
the
wrong
fork
of
the
road
near
the
wolf
pit
oh
ow
said
molly
cringing
what
the
wolf
pit
what
an
awful
name
betsy
laughed
she
tried
to
make
her
laugh
sound
brave
like
cousin
ann
which
always
seemed
so
scornful
of
being
afraid
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
beginning
to
fear
that
they
had
made
the
wrong
turn
and
she
was
not
quite
sure
that
she
could
find
the
way
home
but
she
put
this
out
of
her
mind
and
walked
along
very
fast
peering
ahead
into
the
dusk
oh
it
has
anything
to
do
with
wolves
she
said
in
answer
to
molly
question
anyhow
not
now
it
just
a
big
deep
hole
in
the
ground
where
a
brook
had
dug
out
a
cave
uncle
henry
told
me
all
about
it
when
he
showed
it
to
me
and
then
part
of
the
roof
caved
in
sometimes
there
ice
in
the
corner
of
the
covered
part
all
the
summer
aunt
abigail
says
why
do
you
call
it
the
wolf
pit
asked
molly
walking
very
close
to
betsy
and
holding
very
tightly
to
her
hand
oh
long
ever
so
long
ago
when
the
first
settlers
came
up
here
they
heard
a
wolf
howling
all
night
and
when
it
did
stop
in
the
morning
they
came
up
here
on
the
mountain
and
found
a
wolf
had
fallen
in
and
could
get
out
my
i
hope
they
killed
him
said
molly
oh
gracious
that
was
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
said
betsy
she
was
not
thinking
of
what
she
was
saying
she
was
thinking
that
if
they
were
on
the
right
road
they
ought
to
be
home
by
this
time
she
was
thinking
that
the
right
road
ran
down
hill
to
the
house
all
the
way
and
that
this
certainly
seemed
to
be
going
up
a
little
she
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
shep
stand
here
just
a
minute
molly
she
said
i
want
i
just
want
to
go
ahead
a
little
bit
and
see
and
see
she
darted
on
around
a
curve
of
the
road
and
stood
still
her
heart
sinking
the
road
turned
there
and
led
straight
up
the
mountain
for
just
a
moment
the
little
girl
felt
a
wild
impulse
to
burst
out
in
a
shriek
for
aunt
frances
and
to
run
crazily
away
anywhere
so
long
as
she
was
running
but
the
thought
of
molly
standing
back
there
trustfully
waiting
to
be
taken
care
of
shut
betsy
lips
together
hard
before
her
scream
of
fright
got
out
she
stood
still
thinking
now
she
must
get
frightened
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
walk
back
along
the
road
till
they
came
to
the
fork
and
then
make
the
right
turn
but
what
if
they
did
get
back
to
the
turn
till
it
was
so
dark
they
see
it
well
she
must
think
of
that
she
ran
back
calling
come
on
molly
in
a
tone
she
tried
to
make
as
firm
as
cousin
ann
i
guess
we
have
made
the
wrong
turn
after
all
we
better
but
there
was
no
molly
there
in
the
brief
moment
betsy
had
stood
thinking
molly
had
disappeared
the
long
shadowy
wood
road
held
not
a
trace
of
her
then
betsy
was
frightened
and
then
she
did
begin
to
scream
at
the
top
of
her
voice
molly
molly
she
was
beside
herself
with
terror
and
started
back
hastily
to
hear
molly
voice
very
faint
apparently
coming
from
the
ground
under
her
feet
ow
ow
betsy
get
me
out
get
me
out
where
are
you
shrieked
betsy
i
do
know
came
molly
sobbing
voice
i
just
moved
the
least
little
bit
out
of
the
road
and
slipped
on
the
ice
and
began
to
slide
and
i
could
stop
myself
and
i
fell
down
into
a
deep
hole
betsy
head
felt
as
though
her
hair
were
standing
up
straight
on
end
with
horror
molly
must
have
fallen
down
into
the
wolf
pit
yes
they
were
quite
near
it
she
remembered
now
that
big
tree
stood
right
at
the
place
where
the
brook
tumbled
over
the
edge
and
fell
into
it
although
she
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
falling
in
herself
she
went
cautiously
over
to
this
tree
feeling
her
way
with
her
foot
to
make
sure
she
did
not
slip
and
peered
down
into
the
cavernous
gloom
below
yes
there
was
molly
little
face
just
a
white
speck
the
child
was
crying
sobbing
and
holding
up
her
arms
to
betsy
are
you
hurt
molly
no
i
fell
into
a
big
but
i
all
wet
and
frozen
and
i
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
get
out
betsy
held
on
to
the
her
head
whirled
what
should
she
do
look
here
molly
she
called
down
i
going
to
run
back
along
to
the
right
road
and
back
to
the
house
and
get
uncle
henry
he
come
with
a
rope
and
get
you
out
at
this
molly
crying
rose
to
a
frantic
scream
oh
betsy
do
leave
me
here
alone
do
do
the
wolves
will
get
me
betsy
do
leave
me
alone
the
child
was
wild
with
terror
but
i
ca
get
you
out
myself
screamed
back
betsy
crying
herself
her
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
do
go
do
go
came
up
from
the
darkness
of
the
pit
in
a
piteous
howl
betsy
made
a
great
effort
and
stopped
crying
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
tried
to
think
and
this
is
what
came
into
her
mind
as
a
guide
what
would
cousin
ann
do
if
she
were
here
she
would
cry
she
would
think
of
something
betsy
looked
around
her
desperately
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
big
limb
of
a
broken
off
by
the
wind
which
half
lay
and
half
slantingly
stood
up
against
a
tree
a
little
distance
above
the
mouth
of
the
pit
it
had
been
there
so
long
that
the
needles
had
all
dried
and
fallen
off
and
the
skeleton
of
the
branch
with
the
broken
stubs
looked
like
yes
it
looked
like
a
ladder
that
was
what
cousin
ann
would
have
done
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
molly
she
called
wildly
down
the
pit
warm
all
over
in
excitement
now
listen
you
go
off
there
in
a
corner
where
the
ground
makes
a
sort
of
roof
i
going
to
throw
down
something
you
can
climb
up
on
maybe
ow
ow
it
hit
me
cried
poor
little
molly
more
and
more
frightened
but
she
scrambled
off
under
her
shelter
obediently
while
betsy
struggled
with
the
branch
it
was
so
firmly
imbedded
in
the
snow
that
at
first
she
could
not
budge
it
at
all
but
after
she
cleared
that
away
and
pried
hard
with
the
stick
she
was
using
as
a
lever
she
felt
it
give
a
little
she
bore
down
with
all
her
might
throwing
her
weight
again
and
again
on
her
lever
and
finally
felt
the
big
branch
perceptibly
move
after
that
it
was
easier
as
its
course
was
down
hill
over
the
snow
to
the
mouth
of
the
pit
glowing
and
pushing
wet
with
perspiration
she
slowly
maneuvered
it
along
to
the
edge
turned
it
squarely
gave
it
a
great
shove
and
leaned
over
anxiously
then
she
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
just
as
she
had
hoped
it
went
down
sharp
end
first
and
stuck
fast
in
the
snow
which
had
saved
molly
from
broken
bones
she
was
so
out
of
breath
with
her
work
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
then
molly
there
now
i
guess
you
can
climb
up
to
where
i
can
reach
you
molly
made
a
rush
for
any
way
out
of
her
prison
and
climbed
like
the
little
practiced
squirrel
that
she
was
up
from
one
stub
to
another
to
the
top
of
the
branch
she
was
still
below
the
edge
of
the
pit
there
but
betsy
lay
flat
down
on
the
snow
and
held
out
her
hands
molly
took
hold
hard
and
digging
her
toes
into
the
snow
slowly
wormed
her
way
up
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
it
was
then
at
that
very
moment
that
shep
came
bounding
up
to
them
barking
loudly
and
after
him
cousin
ann
striding
along
in
her
rubber
boots
with
a
lantern
in
her
hand
and
a
rather
anxious
look
on
her
face
she
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
two
little
girls
covered
with
snow
their
faces
flaming
with
excitement
and
at
the
black
hole
gaping
behind
them
i
always
told
father
we
ought
to
put
a
fence
around
that
pit
she
said
in
a
voice
some
day
a
sheep
going
to
fall
down
there
shep
came
along
to
the
house
without
you
and
we
thought
most
likely
you
taken
the
wrong
turn
betsy
felt
terribly
aggrieved
she
wanted
to
be
petted
and
praised
for
her
heroism
she
wanted
cousin
ann
to
realize
oh
if
aunt
frances
were
only
there
she
would
realize
i
fell
down
in
the
hole
and
betsy
wanted
to
go
and
get
putney
but
i
would
let
her
and
so
she
threw
down
a
big
branch
and
i
climbed
out
explained
molly
who
now
that
her
danger
was
past
took
action
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
oh
that
was
how
it
happened
said
cousin
ann
she
looked
down
the
hole
and
saw
the
big
branch
and
looked
back
and
saw
the
long
trail
of
crushed
snow
where
betsy
had
dragged
it
well
now
that
was
quite
a
good
idea
for
a
little
girl
to
have
she
said
briefly
i
guess
do
to
take
care
of
molly
all
right
she
spoke
in
her
usual
voice
and
immediately
drew
the
children
after
her
but
betsy
heart
was
singing
joyfully
as
she
trotted
along
clasping
cousin
ann
strong
hand
now
she
knew
that
cousin
ann
realized
she
trotted
fast
smiling
to
herself
in
the
darkness
what
made
you
think
of
doing
that
asked
cousin
ann
presently
as
they
approached
the
house
why
i
tried
to
think
what
you
would
have
done
if
you
been
there
said
betsy
oh
said
cousin
ann
well
she
did
say
another
word
but
betsy
glancing
up
into
her
face
as
they
stepped
into
the
lighted
room
saw
an
expression
that
made
her
give
a
little
skip
and
hop
of
joy
she
had
pleased
cousin
ann
that
night
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
her
arm
over
molly
cuddled
up
warm
beside
her
she
remembered
oh
ever
so
faintly
as
something
of
no
importance
that
she
had
failed
in
an
examination
that
afternoon
chapter
viii
betsy
starts
a
sewing
society
betsy
and
molly
had
taken
deborah
to
school
with
them
deborah
was
the
old
wooden
doll
with
brown
painted
curls
she
had
lain
in
a
trunk
almost
ever
since
aunt
abigail
childhood
because
cousin
ann
had
never
cared
for
dolls
when
she
was
a
little
girl
at
first
betsy
had
not
dared
to
ask
to
see
her
much
less
to
play
with
her
but
when
ellen
as
she
had
promised
came
over
to
putney
farm
that
first
saturday
she
had
said
right
out
as
soon
as
she
landed
in
the
house
oh
putney
we
play
with
deborah
and
aunt
abigail
had
answered
why
yes
of
course
i
knew
there
was
something
i
kept
forgetting
she
went
up
with
them
herself
to
the
cold
attic
and
opened
the
little
under
the
eaves
there
lay
a
doll
flat
on
her
back
looking
up
at
them
brightly
out
of
her
blue
eyes
well
debby
dear
said
aunt
abigail
taking
her
up
gently
it
a
good
long
time
since
you
and
i
played
under
the
lilac
bushes
is
it
i
expect
you
been
pretty
lonesome
up
here
all
these
years
never
you
mind
you
have
some
good
times
again
now
she
pulled
down
the
doll
full
ruffled
skirt
straightened
the
lace
at
the
neck
of
her
dress
and
held
her
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
her
silently
you
could
tell
by
the
way
she
spoke
by
the
way
she
touched
deborah
by
the
way
she
looked
at
her
that
she
had
loved
the
doll
very
dearly
and
maybe
still
did
a
little
when
she
put
deborah
into
betsy
arms
the
child
felt
that
she
was
receiving
something
very
precious
almost
something
alive
she
and
ellen
looked
with
delight
at
the
yards
and
yards
of
ribbon
sewed
on
by
hand
to
the
ruffles
of
the
skirt
and
lifted
up
the
silk
folds
to
admire
the
carefully
made
full
petticoats
and
frilly
drawers
the
pretty
soft
old
kid
shoes
and
white
stockings
aunt
abigail
looked
at
them
with
an
absent
smile
on
her
lips
as
though
she
were
living
over
old
scenes
illustration
betsy
and
ellen
and
the
old
doll
finally
it
too
cold
to
play
up
here
she
said
coming
to
herself
with
a
long
breath
you
better
bring
deborah
and
the
trunk
down
into
the
south
room
she
carried
the
doll
and
betsy
and
ellen
each
took
an
end
of
the
old
trunk
no
larger
than
a
modern
suitcase
they
settled
themselves
on
the
big
couch
back
of
the
table
with
the
lamp
old
shep
was
on
it
but
betsy
coaxed
him
off
by
putting
down
some
bones
cousin
ann
had
been
saving
for
him
when
he
finished
those
and
came
back
for
the
rest
of
his
snooze
he
found
his
place
occupied
by
the
little
girls
sitting
examining
the
contents
of
the
trunk
all
spread
out
around
them
shep
sighed
deeply
and
sat
down
with
his
nose
resting
on
the
couch
near
betsy
knee
following
all
their
movements
with
his
kind
dark
eyes
once
in
a
while
betsy
stopped
hugging
deborah
or
exclaiming
over
a
new
dress
long
enough
to
pat
shep
head
and
fondle
his
ears
this
was
what
he
was
waiting
for
and
every
time
she
did
it
he
wagged
his
tail
thumpingly
against
the
floor
after
that
deborah
and
her
trunk
were
kept
downstairs
where
betsy
could
play
with
her
and
often
she
was
taken
to
school
you
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
taking
a
doll
to
school
did
you
well
i
told
you
this
was
a
queer
school
that
any
modern
school
superintendent
would
sniff
at
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
only
betsy
who
took
her
doll
to
school
all
the
little
girls
did
whenever
they
felt
like
it
miss
benton
the
teacher
had
a
shelf
for
them
in
the
where
the
wraps
were
hung
and
the
dolls
sat
on
it
and
waited
patiently
all
through
lessons
at
recess
time
or
nooning
each
little
mother
snatched
her
own
child
and
began
to
play
as
soon
as
it
grew
warm
enough
to
play
outdoors
without
just
racing
around
every
minute
to
keep
from
freezing
to
death
the
dolls
and
their
mothers
went
out
to
a
great
pile
of
rocks
at
one
end
of
the
bare
stony
field
which
was
the
playground
there
they
sat
and
played
in
the
spring
sunshine
warmer
from
day
to
day
there
were
a
great
many
holes
and
shelves
and
pockets
and
little
caves
in
the
rocks
which
made
lovely
places
for
playing
each
little
girl
had
her
own
particular
and
rooms
and
they
visited
their
dolls
back
and
forth
all
around
the
pile
and
as
they
played
they
talked
very
fast
about
all
sorts
of
things
being
little
girls
and
not
boys
who
just
yelled
and
howled
inarticulately
as
they
played
ball
or
or
prisoner
goal
racing
and
running
and
wrestling
noisily
all
around
the
rocks
there
was
one
child
who
neither
played
with
the
girls
nor
ran
and
whooped
with
the
boys
this
was
little
one
of
the
two
boys
in
molly
first
grade
at
recess
time
he
generally
hung
about
the
school
door
by
himself
looking
moodily
down
and
knocking
the
toe
of
his
ragged
muddy
shoe
against
a
stone
the
little
girls
were
talking
about
him
one
day
as
they
played
my
is
that
brewster
the
child
said
eliza
who
had
the
second
grade
all
to
herself
although
molly
now
read
out
of
the
second
reader
with
her
mercy
yes
so
ragged
said
anastasia
monahan
called
stashie
for
short
she
was
a
big
girl
fourteen
years
old
who
was
in
the
seventh
grade
he
does
look
as
if
he
ever
combed
his
hair
said
betsy
it
looks
just
like
a
wisp
of
old
hay
and
sometimes
little
molly
proudly
added
her
bit
to
the
talk
of
the
older
girls
he
forgets
to
put
on
any
stockings
and
just
has
his
dreadful
old
shoes
on
over
his
dirty
bare
feet
i
guess
he
has
got
any
stockings
half
the
time
said
big
stashie
scornfully
i
guess
his
stepfather
drinks
up
how
can
he
drink
up
stockings
asked
molly
opening
her
round
eyes
very
wide
sh
you
must
ask
little
girls
should
know
about
such
things
should
they
betsy
no
indeed
said
betsy
looking
mysterious
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
herself
had
no
idea
what
stashie
meant
but
she
looked
wise
and
said
nothing
some
of
the
boys
had
squatted
down
near
the
rocks
for
a
game
of
marbles
now
well
anyhow
said
molly
resentfully
i
do
care
what
his
stepfather
does
to
his
stockings
i
wish
would
wear
to
school
and
lots
of
times
he
has
anything
on
under
those
horrid
old
overalls
either
i
can
see
his
bare
skin
through
the
torn
places
i
wish
he
did
have
to
sit
so
near
me
said
betsy
complainingly
he
so
dirty
well
i
do
want
him
near
me
either
cried
all
the
other
little
girls
at
once
ralph
glanced
up
at
them
frowning
from
where
he
knelt
with
his
middle
finger
crooked
behind
a
marble
ready
for
a
shot
he
looked
as
he
always
did
very
rough
and
oh
you
girls
make
me
sick
he
said
he
sent
his
marble
straight
to
the
mark
pocketed
his
opponent
and
stood
up
scowling
at
the
little
mothers
i
guess
if
you
had
to
live
the
way
he
does
you
be
dirty
half
the
time
he
do
get
anything
to
eat
before
he
comes
to
school
and
if
my
mother
did
put
up
some
extra
for
him
in
my
box
he
would
get
any
lunch
either
and
then
you
go
and
jump
on
him
why
does
his
own
mother
put
up
his
lunch
betsy
challenged
their
critic
he
has
got
any
mother
she
dead
said
ralph
turning
away
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
yelled
to
the
boys
come
on
fellers
to
the
bridge
and
back
and
was
off
with
the
others
racing
at
his
heels
well
anyhow
i
do
care
he
is
dirty
and
horrid
said
stashie
emphatically
looking
over
at
the
drooping
battered
little
figure
leaning
against
the
school
door
listlessly
kicking
at
a
stone
but
betsy
did
not
say
anything
more
just
then
the
teacher
who
boarded
was
staying
at
putney
farm
at
that
time
and
that
evening
as
they
all
sat
around
the
lamp
in
the
south
room
betsy
looked
up
from
her
game
of
checkers
with
uncle
henry
and
asked
how
can
anybody
drink
up
stockings
mercy
child
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
aunt
abigail
betsy
repeated
what
anastasia
monahan
had
said
and
was
flattered
by
the
instant
rather
startled
attention
given
her
by
the
why
i
did
know
that
bud
walker
had
taken
to
drinking
again
said
uncle
henry
my
that
too
bad
who
takes
care
of
that
child
anyhow
now
that
poor
susie
is
dead
aunt
abigail
asked
of
everybody
in
general
is
he
just
living
there
alone
with
that
stepfather
how
do
they
get
enough
to
eat
said
cousin
ann
looking
troubled
apparently
betsy
question
had
brought
something
half
forgotten
and
altogether
neglected
into
their
minds
they
talked
for
some
time
after
that
about
the
teacher
confirming
what
betsy
and
stashie
had
said
and
we
sitting
right
here
with
plenty
to
eat
and
never
raising
a
hand
cried
aunt
abigail
how
you
will
let
things
slip
out
of
your
mind
said
cousin
ann
remorsefully
it
struck
betsy
vividly
that
was
not
at
all
the
one
they
blamed
for
his
objectionable
appearance
she
felt
quite
ashamed
to
go
on
with
the
other
things
she
and
the
little
girls
had
said
and
fell
silent
pretending
to
be
very
much
absorbed
in
her
game
of
checkers
do
you
know
said
aunt
abigail
suddenly
as
though
an
inspiration
had
just
struck
her
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
if
that
elmore
pond
might
adopt
if
he
was
gone
at
the
right
way
who
elmore
pond
asked
the
schoolteacher
why
you
must
have
seen
him
that
great
big
man
that
comes
through
here
twice
a
year
buying
stock
he
lives
over
bigby
way
but
his
wife
was
a
hillsboro
girl
matey
pelham
an
awfully
nice
girl
she
was
too
they
never
had
any
children
and
matey
told
me
the
last
time
she
was
back
for
a
visit
that
she
and
her
husband
talked
quite
often
about
adopting
a
little
boy
seems
that
pond
has
always
wanted
a
little
boy
he
such
a
nice
man
be
a
lovely
home
for
a
child
but
goodness
said
the
teacher
nobody
would
want
to
adopt
such
an
little
ragamuffin
as
that
he
looks
so
meeching
too
i
guess
his
stepfather
is
real
mean
to
him
when
he
been
drinking
and
it
got
so
he
hardly
dares
hold
his
head
up
the
clock
struck
loudly
well
hear
that
said
cousin
ann
nine
and
the
children
not
in
bed
molly
most
asleep
this
minute
trot
along
with
you
betsy
trot
along
molly
and
betsy
be
sure
molly
nightgown
is
buttoned
up
all
the
way
so
it
happened
that
although
the
were
evidently
going
on
to
talk
about
brewster
betsy
heard
no
more
of
what
they
said
she
herself
went
on
thinking
about
while
she
was
undressing
and
answering
absently
little
molly
chatter
she
was
thinking
about
him
even
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
had
put
the
light
out
and
were
lying
snuggled
up
to
each
other
back
to
front
their
four
legs
crooked
at
the
same
angle
fitting
in
together
neatly
like
two
spoons
in
a
drawer
she
was
thinking
about
him
when
she
woke
up
and
as
soon
as
she
could
get
hold
of
cousin
ann
she
poured
out
a
new
plan
she
had
never
been
afraid
of
cousin
ann
since
the
evening
molly
had
fallen
into
the
wolf
pit
and
betsy
had
seen
that
pleased
smile
on
cousin
ann
firm
lips
cousin
ann
could
we
girls
at
school
get
together
and
sew
have
to
help
us
some
and
make
some
nice
new
clothes
for
little
brewster
and
fix
him
up
so
he
look
better
and
maybe
that
pond
will
like
him
and
adopt
him
cousin
ann
listened
attentively
and
nodded
her
head
yes
i
think
that
would
be
a
good
idea
she
said
we
were
thinking
last
night
we
ought
to
do
something
for
him
if
you
make
the
clothes
mother
knit
him
some
stockings
and
father
will
get
him
some
shoes
pond
never
makes
his
spring
trip
till
late
may
so
we
have
plenty
of
time
betsy
was
full
of
importance
that
day
at
school
and
at
recess
time
got
the
girls
together
on
the
rocks
and
told
them
all
about
the
plan
cousin
ann
says
she
help
us
and
we
can
meet
at
our
house
every
saturday
afternoon
till
we
get
them
done
it
be
fun
aunt
abigail
telephoned
down
to
the
store
right
away
and
wilkins
says
he
give
the
cloth
if
we
make
it
up
betsy
spoke
very
grandly
of
making
it
up
although
she
had
hardly
held
a
needle
in
her
life
and
when
the
saturday
afternoon
meetings
began
she
was
ashamed
to
see
how
much
better
ellen
and
even
eliza
could
sew
than
she
to
keep
her
end
up
she
was
driven
to
practising
her
stitches
around
the
lamp
in
the
evenings
with
aunt
abigail
keeping
an
eye
on
her
cousin
ann
supervised
the
sewing
on
saturday
afternoons
and
taught
those
of
the
little
girls
whose
legs
were
long
enough
how
to
use
the
sewing
machine
first
they
made
a
little
pair
of
trousers
out
of
an
old
gray
woolen
skirt
of
aunt
abigail
this
was
for
practice
before
they
cut
into
the
piece
of
new
blue
serge
that
the
storekeeper
had
sent
up
cousin
ann
showed
them
how
to
pin
the
pattern
on
the
goods
and
they
each
cut
out
one
piece
those
flat
pieces
of
cloth
certainly
did
look
less
like
a
pair
of
trousers
to
betsy
than
anything
she
had
ever
seen
then
one
of
the
girls
read
aloud
very
slowly
the
directions
from
the
wrapper
of
the
pattern
about
how
to
put
the
pieces
together
cousin
ann
helped
here
a
little
particularly
just
as
they
were
about
to
put
the
sections
together
stashie
as
the
oldest
did
the
first
basting
putting
the
notches
together
carefully
just
as
they
read
the
instructions
aloud
and
there
all
of
a
sudden
was
a
rough
little
sketch
of
a
pair
of
knee
trousers
without
any
hem
or
any
of
course
but
just
the
complicated
shape
they
ought
to
be
it
was
like
a
miracle
to
betsy
then
cousin
ann
helped
them
sew
the
seams
on
the
machine
and
they
all
turned
to
for
the
basting
of
the
facings
and
the
finishing
they
each
made
one
buttonhole
it
was
the
first
one
betsy
had
ever
made
and
when
she
got
through
she
was
as
tired
as
though
she
had
run
all
the
way
to
school
and
back
tired
but
very
proud
although
when
cousin
ann
inspected
that
buttonhole
she
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
for
a
minute
as
though
she
were
going
to
sneeze
although
she
did
sneeze
at
all
it
took
them
two
saturdays
to
finish
up
that
trial
pair
of
trousers
and
when
they
showed
the
result
to
aunt
abigail
she
was
delighted
well
to
think
of
that
being
my
old
skirt
she
said
putting
on
her
spectacles
to
examine
the
work
she
did
not
laugh
either
when
she
saw
those
buttonholes
but
she
got
up
hastily
and
went
into
the
next
room
where
they
soon
heard
her
coughing
then
they
made
a
little
blouse
out
of
some
new
blue
gingham
cousin
ann
happened
to
have
enough
left
over
from
a
dress
she
was
making
this
thin
material
was
ever
so
much
easier
to
manage
than
the
gray
flannel
and
they
had
the
little
garment
done
in
no
time
even
to
the
buttons
and
buttonholes
when
it
came
to
making
the
buttonholes
cousin
ann
sat
right
down
with
each
one
and
supervised
every
stitch
you
may
not
be
surprised
to
know
that
they
were
a
great
improvement
over
the
first
batch
then
making
a
great
ceremony
of
it
they
began
on
the
store
material
working
twice
a
week
now
because
may
was
slipping
along
very
fast
and
pond
might
be
there
at
any
time
they
knew
pretty
well
how
to
go
ahead
on
this
one
after
the
experience
of
their
first
pair
and
cousin
ann
was
not
much
needed
except
as
adviser
in
hard
places
she
sat
there
in
the
room
with
them
doing
some
sewing
of
her
own
so
quiet
that
half
the
time
they
forgot
she
was
there
it
was
great
fun
sewing
all
together
and
chattering
as
they
sewed
a
good
deal
of
the
time
they
talked
about
how
splendid
it
was
of
them
to
be
so
kind
to
little
my
i
do
believe
most
girls
would
put
themselves
out
this
way
for
a
dirty
little
boy
said
stashie
complacently
no
indeed
chimed
in
betsy
it
just
like
a
story
is
it
working
and
sacrificing
for
the
poor
i
guess
he
thank
us
all
right
for
sure
said
ellen
he
never
forget
us
as
long
as
he
lives
i
do
suppose
betsy
her
imagination
fired
by
this
suggestion
said
i
guess
when
he
grown
up
he
be
telling
everybody
about
how
when
he
was
so
poor
and
ragged
stashie
monahan
and
ellen
peters
and
elizabeth
ann
and
eliza
put
in
that
little
girl
hastily
very
much
afraid
she
would
not
be
given
her
due
share
of
the
glory
cousin
ann
sewed
and
listened
and
said
nothing
toward
the
end
of
may
two
little
blouses
two
pairs
of
trousers
two
pairs
of
stockings
two
sets
of
underwear
contributed
by
the
teacher
and
the
pair
of
shoes
uncle
henry
gave
were
ready
the
little
girls
handled
the
pile
of
new
garments
with
inexpressible
pride
and
debated
just
which
way
of
bestowing
them
was
sufficiently
grand
to
be
worthy
the
occasion
betsy
was
for
taking
them
to
school
and
giving
them
to
one
by
one
so
that
each
child
could
have
her
thanks
separately
but
stashie
wanted
to
take
them
to
the
house
when
stepfather
would
be
there
and
shame
him
by
showing
that
little
girls
had
had
to
do
what
he
ought
to
have
done
cousin
ann
broke
into
the
discussion
by
asking
in
her
quiet
firm
voice
why
do
you
want
to
know
where
the
clothes
come
from
they
had
forgotten
again
that
she
was
there
and
turned
around
quickly
to
stare
at
her
nobody
could
think
of
any
answer
to
her
very
queer
question
it
had
not
occurred
to
any
one
that
there
could
be
such
a
question
cousin
ann
shifted
her
ground
and
asked
another
why
did
you
make
these
clothes
anyhow
they
stared
again
speechless
why
did
she
ask
that
she
knew
why
finally
little
molly
said
in
her
honest
baby
way
why
you
know
why
miss
ann
so
brewster
will
look
nice
and
pond
will
maybe
adopt
him
well
said
cousin
ann
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
knowing
who
did
it
why
he
would
know
who
to
be
grateful
to
cried
betsy
oh
said
cousin
ann
oh
i
see
you
did
do
it
to
help
you
did
it
to
have
him
grateful
to
you
i
see
molly
is
such
a
little
girl
it
no
wonder
she
did
really
take
in
what
you
girls
were
up
to
she
nodded
her
head
wisely
as
though
now
she
understood
but
if
she
did
little
molly
certainly
did
not
she
had
not
the
least
idea
what
everybody
was
talking
about
she
looked
from
one
sober
downcast
face
to
another
rather
anxiously
what
was
the
matter
apparently
nothing
was
really
the
matter
she
decided
for
after
a
minute
silence
miss
ann
got
up
with
entirely
her
usual
face
of
cheerful
gravity
and
said
do
you
think
you
little
girls
ought
to
top
off
this
last
afternoon
with
a
there
a
new
batch
of
cookies
and
you
can
make
yourselves
some
lemonade
if
you
want
to
they
had
these
refreshments
out
on
the
porch
in
the
sunshine
with
their
dolls
for
guests
and
a
great
deal
of
chatter
for
sauce
nobody
said
another
word
about
how
to
give
the
clothes
to
till
just
as
the
girls
were
going
away
betsy
said
walking
along
with
the
two
older
ones
say
do
you
think
it
be
fun
to
go
some
evening
after
dark
and
leave
the
clothes
on
doorstep
and
knock
and
run
away
quick
before
anybody
comes
to
the
door
she
spoke
in
an
uncertain
voice
and
smoothed
deborah
carved
wooden
curls
yes
i
do
said
ellen
not
looking
at
betsy
but
down
at
the
weeds
by
the
road
i
think
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
little
molly
playing
with
annie
and
eliza
did
not
hear
this
but
she
was
allowed
to
go
with
the
older
girls
on
the
great
expedition
it
was
a
warm
dark
evening
in
late
may
with
the
frogs
piping
their
sweet
high
note
and
the
first
of
the
fireflies
wheeling
over
the
wet
meadows
near
the
house
where
lived
the
girls
took
turns
in
carrying
the
big
bundle
and
stole
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
full
of
excitement
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
nothing
and
pressing
their
hands
over
their
mouths
to
keep
back
the
giggles
there
was
of
course
no
reason
on
earth
why
they
should
giggle
which
is
of
course
the
very
reason
why
they
did
if
ever
been
a
little
girl
you
know
about
that
one
window
of
the
small
house
was
dimly
lighted
they
found
when
they
came
in
sight
of
it
and
they
thrilled
with
excitement
and
joyful
alarm
suppose
dreadful
stepfather
should
come
out
and
yell
at
them
they
came
forward
on
tiptoe
making
a
great
deal
of
noise
by
stepping
on
twigs
rustling
bushes
crackling
gravel
under
their
feet
and
doing
all
the
other
things
that
make
such
a
noise
at
night
and
never
do
in
the
daytime
but
nobody
stirred
inside
the
room
with
the
lighted
window
they
crept
forward
and
peeped
cautiously
inside
and
stopped
giggling
the
dim
light
coming
from
a
little
kerosene
lamp
with
a
smoky
chimney
fell
on
a
dismal
cluttered
room
a
bare
greasy
wooden
table
and
two
chairs
with
little
in
one
of
them
he
had
fallen
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arms
his
pinched
dirty
sad
little
figure
showing
in
the
light
from
the
lamp
his
feet
dangled
high
above
the
floor
in
their
broken
muddy
shoes
one
sleeve
was
torn
to
the
shoulder
a
piece
of
dry
bread
had
slipped
from
his
bony
little
hand
and
a
tin
dipper
stood
beside
him
on
the
bare
table
nobody
else
was
in
the
room
nor
evidently
in
the
darkened
empty
fireless
house
illustration
he
had
fallen
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arms
as
long
as
she
lives
betsy
will
never
forget
what
she
saw
that
night
through
that
window
her
eyes
grew
very
hot
and
her
hands
very
cold
her
heart
thumped
hard
she
reached
for
little
molly
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
in
the
darkness
suppose
it
were
little
molly
asleep
there
all
alone
in
the
dirty
dismal
house
with
no
supper
and
nobody
to
put
her
to
bed
she
found
that
ellen
next
her
was
crying
quietly
into
the
corner
of
her
apron
nobody
said
a
word
stashie
who
had
the
bundle
walked
around
soberly
to
the
front
door
put
it
down
and
knocked
loudly
they
all
darted
away
noiselessly
to
the
road
to
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
waited
until
the
door
opened
a
square
of
yellow
light
appeared
with
figure
very
small
at
the
bottom
of
it
they
saw
him
stoop
and
pick
up
the
bundle
and
go
back
into
the
house
then
they
went
quickly
and
silently
back
separating
at
the
with
no
greetings
molly
and
betsy
began
to
climb
the
hill
to
putney
farm
it
was
a
very
warm
night
for
may
and
little
molly
began
to
puff
for
breath
sit
down
on
this
rock
awhile
and
rest
she
said
they
were
up
the
hill
now
from
the
rock
they
could
see
the
lights
in
the
farmhouses
scattered
along
the
valley
road
and
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
opposite
them
like
big
stars
fallen
from
the
multitude
above
betsy
lay
down
on
the
rock
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
after
a
silence
little
molly
chirping
voice
said
oh
i
thought
you
said
we
were
going
to
march
up
to
in
school
and
give
him
his
clothes
did
you
forget
about
that
betsy
gave
a
wriggle
of
shame
as
she
remembered
that
plan
no
we
did
forget
it
she
said
we
thought
this
would
be
a
better
way
but
how
know
who
to
thank
asked
molly
that
no
matter
said
betsy
yes
it
was
who
said
that
and
meant
it
too
she
was
not
even
thinking
of
what
she
was
saying
between
her
and
the
stars
thick
over
her
in
the
black
soft
sky
she
saw
again
that
dirty
disordered
room
and
the
little
boy
all
alone
asleep
with
a
piece
of
dry
bread
in
his
bony
little
fingers
she
looked
hard
and
long
at
that
picture
all
the
time
seeing
the
quiet
stars
through
it
and
then
she
turned
over
and
hid
her
face
on
the
rock
she
had
said
her
now
i
lay
me
every
night
since
she
could
remember
but
she
had
never
prayed
till
she
lay
there
with
her
face
on
the
rock
saying
over
and
over
oh
god
please
please
please
make
pond
adopt
chapter
ix
the
new
clothes
fail
all
the
little
girls
went
early
to
school
the
next
day
eager
for
the
first
glimpse
of
in
his
new
clothes
they
now
quite
enjoyed
the
mystery
about
who
had
made
them
and
were
full
of
agreeable
excitement
as
the
little
figure
was
seen
approaching
down
the
road
he
wore
the
gray
trousers
and
the
little
blue
shirt
the
trousers
were
a
little
too
long
the
shirt
a
perfect
fit
the
girls
gazed
at
him
with
pride
as
he
came
on
the
playground
walking
briskly
along
in
the
new
shoes
which
were
just
the
right
size
he
had
been
wearing
all
winter
a
pair
of
women
shoes
from
a
distance
he
looked
like
another
child
but
as
he
came
closer
oh
his
face
his
hair
his
hands
his
the
little
fellow
had
evidently
tried
to
live
up
to
his
beautiful
new
raiment
for
his
hair
had
been
roughly
put
back
from
his
face
and
around
his
mouth
and
nose
was
a
small
area
of
almost
clean
skin
where
he
had
made
an
attempt
at
washing
his
face
but
he
had
made
practically
no
impression
on
the
layers
of
encrusted
dirt
and
the
little
girls
looked
at
him
ruefully
pond
would
certainly
never
take
a
fancy
to
such
a
dreadfully
grimy
child
his
new
clean
clothes
made
him
look
all
the
worse
as
though
dirty
on
purpose
the
little
girls
retired
to
their
and
talked
over
their
bitter
disappointment
ralph
and
the
other
boys
absorbed
in
a
game
of
marbles
near
them
had
gone
proudly
into
the
schoolroom
to
show
himself
to
miss
benton
it
was
the
day
before
decoration
day
and
a
good
deal
of
time
was
taken
up
with
practising
on
the
recitations
they
were
going
to
give
at
the
decoration
day
exercises
in
the
village
several
of
the
children
from
each
school
in
the
township
were
to
speak
pieces
in
the
town
hall
betsy
was
to
recite
barbara
frietchie
her
first
love
in
that
school
but
she
droned
it
over
with
none
of
her
usual
pleasure
her
eyes
on
little
smiling
face
so
unconscious
of
its
dinginess
at
noon
time
the
boys
disappeared
down
toward
the
they
often
took
a
swim
at
noon
and
nobody
thought
anything
about
it
on
that
day
the
little
girls
ate
their
lunch
on
their
rock
mourning
over
the
failure
of
their
plans
and
scheming
ways
to
meet
the
new
obstacle
stashie
suggested
could
your
aunt
abigail
invite
him
up
to
your
house
for
supper
and
then
give
him
a
bath
afterward
but
betsy
although
she
had
never
heard
of
treating
a
in
this
way
was
sure
that
it
was
not
possible
she
shook
her
head
sadly
her
eyes
on
the
gleam
of
white
where
the
boys
jumped
up
and
down
in
their
that
was
not
a
good
name
for
it
because
there
was
only
one
part
of
it
deep
enough
to
swim
in
mostly
it
was
a
shallow
bay
in
an
arm
of
the
river
where
the
water
was
only
up
to
a
little
boy
knees
and
where
there
was
almost
no
current
the
sun
beating
down
on
it
made
it
quite
warm
and
even
the
mothers
allowed
them
to
go
in
they
only
jumped
up
and
down
and
squealed
and
splashed
each
other
but
they
enjoyed
that
quite
as
much
as
frank
and
harry
the
two
enjoyed
their
swooping
dives
from
the
over
the
pool
they
were
late
in
getting
back
from
the
river
that
day
and
miss
benton
had
to
ring
her
bell
hard
in
that
direction
before
they
came
trooping
up
and
clattered
into
the
schoolroom
where
the
girls
already
sat
their
eyes
lowered
virtuously
to
their
books
with
a
prim
air
of
they
were
never
late
betsy
was
reciting
her
arithmetic
she
was
getting
on
famously
with
that
weeks
ago
as
soon
as
miss
benton
had
seen
the
confusion
of
the
little
girl
mind
the
two
had
settled
down
to
a
serious
struggle
with
that
subject
miss
benton
had
had
betsy
recite
all
by
herself
so
she
would
be
flurried
by
the
others
and
to
begin
with
had
gone
back
back
back
to
bedrock
to
things
betsy
absolutely
knew
to
the
and
the
and
then
very
cautiously
a
step
at
a
time
they
had
advanced
stopping
short
whenever
betsy
felt
a
beginning
of
that
bewildered
guessing
impulse
which
made
her
answer
wildly
at
random
after
a
while
in
the
dark
night
which
arithmetic
had
always
been
to
her
betsy
began
to
make
out
a
few
definite
outlines
which
were
always
there
facts
which
she
knew
to
be
so
without
guessing
from
the
expression
of
her
teacher
face
from
that
moment
her
progress
had
been
rapid
one
sure
fact
hooking
itself
on
to
another
and
another
one
on
to
that
she
attacked
a
page
of
problems
now
with
a
zest
and
which
made
her
arithmetic
lessons
among
the
most
interesting
hours
at
school
on
that
day
she
was
standing
up
at
the
board
a
piece
of
chalk
in
her
hand
chewing
her
tongue
and
thinking
hard
how
to
find
out
the
amount
of
needed
for
a
room
feet
square
with
two
doors
and
two
windows
in
it
when
her
eye
fell
on
little
bent
over
his
reading
book
she
forgot
her
arithmetic
she
forgot
where
she
was
she
stared
and
stared
till
ellen
catching
the
direction
of
her
eyes
looked
and
stared
too
little
was
clean
preternaturally
almost
wetly
clean
his
face
was
clean
and
shining
his
ears
shone
pink
and
fair
his
hands
were
absolutely
spotless
even
his
hair
was
clean
and
still
damp
brushed
flatly
back
till
it
shone
in
the
sun
betsy
blinked
her
eyes
a
great
many
times
thinking
she
must
be
dreaming
but
every
time
she
opened
them
there
was
looking
white
and
polished
like
a
new
willow
whistle
somebody
poked
her
hard
in
the
ribs
she
started
and
turning
saw
ralph
who
was
doing
a
sum
beside
her
on
the
board
scowling
at
her
under
his
black
brows
quit
gawking
at
he
said
under
his
breath
you
make
me
tired
something
conscious
and
in
his
manner
made
betsy
understand
at
once
what
had
happened
ralph
had
taken
down
to
the
little
boys
and
had
washed
him
all
over
she
remembered
now
that
they
had
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
there
her
face
broke
into
a
radiant
smile
and
she
began
to
say
something
to
ralph
about
how
nice
that
was
of
him
but
he
frowned
again
and
said
crossly
aw
cut
it
out
look
at
what
you
done
there
if
i
x
and
get
it
right
how
queer
boys
are
thought
betsy
erasing
her
mistake
and
putting
down
the
right
answer
but
she
did
not
try
to
speak
to
ralph
again
about
not
even
after
school
when
she
saw
going
home
with
a
new
cap
on
his
head
which
she
recognized
as
ralph
she
just
looked
at
ralph
bare
head
and
smiled
her
eyes
at
him
keeping
the
rest
of
her
face
sober
the
way
cousin
ann
did
for
just
a
minute
ralph
almost
smiled
back
at
least
he
looked
quite
friendly
they
stepped
along
toward
home
together
the
first
time
ralph
had
ever
condescended
to
walk
beside
a
girl
we
got
a
new
colt
he
said
have
you
she
said
what
color
black
with
a
white
star
and
they
going
to
let
me
ride
him
when
he
old
enough
my
wo
that
be
nice
said
betsy
and
all
the
time
they
were
both
thinking
of
little
with
his
new
clothes
and
his
sweet
thin
face
shining
with
cleanliness
do
you
like
spruce
gum
asked
ralph
oh
i
love
gum
said
betsy
well
i
bring
you
down
a
chunk
tomorrow
if
i
do
forget
it
said
ralph
turning
off
at
the
they
had
not
mentioned
at
all
the
next
day
they
were
to
have
school
only
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
they
were
to
go
in
a
big
down
to
the
village
to
the
exercises
came
to
school
in
his
new
trousers
and
his
white
blouse
the
little
girls
gloated
over
his
appearance
and
hung
around
him
for
who
was
to
visit
school
that
morning
but
pond
himself
cousin
ann
had
arranged
it
somehow
it
took
cousin
ann
to
fix
things
during
recess
as
they
were
playing
on
the
playground
pond
and
uncle
henry
drew
up
to
the
edge
of
the
playground
stopped
their
horse
and
talking
and
laughing
together
watched
the
children
at
play
betsy
looked
hard
at
the
big
burly
man
with
the
smiling
eyes
and
the
hearty
laugh
and
decided
that
he
would
do
perfectly
for
but
what
she
decided
was
to
have
little
importance
apparently
for
after
all
he
would
not
get
out
of
the
wagon
but
said
he
have
to
drive
right
on
to
the
village
just
like
that
with
no
excuse
other
than
a
careless
glance
at
his
watch
no
he
guessed
he
would
have
time
this
morning
he
said
betsy
cast
an
imploring
look
up
into
uncle
henry
face
but
evidently
he
felt
himself
quite
helpless
too
oh
if
only
cousin
ann
had
come
she
would
have
marched
him
into
the
schoolhouse
but
uncle
henry
was
not
cousin
ann
and
though
betsy
saw
him
as
they
drove
away
conscientiously
point
out
little
resplendent
and
shining
pond
only
nodded
absently
as
though
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
betsy
could
have
cried
with
disappointment
but
she
and
the
other
girls
putting
their
heads
together
for
comfort
told
each
other
that
there
was
time
enough
yet
pond
would
not
leave
town
till
tomorrow
perhaps
there
was
still
some
hope
but
that
afternoon
even
this
last
hope
was
dashed
as
they
gathered
at
the
schoolhouse
the
girls
fresh
and
crisp
in
their
newly
starched
dresses
with
red
or
blue
the
boys
very
in
their
dark
suits
clean
collars
new
caps
all
but
ralph
and
blacked
shoes
there
was
no
little
they
waited
and
waited
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
finally
uncle
henry
who
was
to
drive
the
down
to
town
looked
at
his
watch
gathered
up
the
reins
and
said
they
would
be
late
if
they
did
start
right
away
maybe
had
had
a
chance
to
ride
in
with
somebody
else
they
all
piled
in
the
horses
stepped
off
the
wheels
grated
on
the
stones
and
just
at
that
moment
a
dismal
sound
of
sobbing
wails
reached
them
from
the
woodshed
back
of
the
schoolhouse
the
children
tumbled
out
as
fast
as
they
had
tumbled
in
and
ran
back
betsy
and
ralph
at
their
head
there
in
the
woodshed
was
little
huddled
in
the
corner
behind
some
wood
crying
and
crying
and
crying
digging
his
fists
into
his
eyes
his
face
all
smeared
with
tears
and
dirt
and
he
was
dressed
again
in
his
filthy
torn
old
overalls
and
ragged
shirt
his
poor
little
bare
feet
shone
with
a
piteous
cleanliness
in
that
dark
place
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
the
children
asked
him
all
at
once
he
flung
himself
on
ralph
burying
his
face
in
the
other
coat
and
sobbed
out
some
disjointed
story
which
only
ralph
could
hear
and
then
as
last
and
final
climax
of
the
disaster
who
should
come
looking
over
the
shoulders
of
the
children
but
uncle
henry
and
pond
and
all
ragged
and
dirty
again
betsy
sat
down
weakly
on
a
pile
of
wood
utterly
disheartened
what
was
the
use
of
anything
what
the
matter
asked
the
two
men
together
ralph
turned
with
an
angry
toss
of
his
dark
head
and
told
them
bitterly
over
the
heads
of
the
children
he
just
had
some
decent
clothes
first
ones
he
ever
had
and
he
was
plotting
on
going
to
the
exercises
in
the
town
hall
and
that
darned
old
skunk
of
a
stepfather
has
gone
and
taken
and
sold
to
get
whiskey
i
like
to
kill
him
betsy
could
have
flung
her
arms
around
ralph
he
looked
so
exactly
the
way
she
felt
yes
he
is
a
darned
old
skunk
she
said
to
herself
rejoicing
in
the
bad
words
she
did
not
know
before
it
took
bad
words
to
qualify
what
had
happened
she
saw
an
electric
spark
pass
from
ralph
blazing
eyes
to
broad
face
now
grim
and
fierce
she
saw
pond
step
forward
brushing
the
children
out
of
his
way
like
a
giant
among
dwarfs
she
saw
him
stoop
and
pick
little
up
in
his
great
strong
arms
and
holding
him
close
stride
furiously
out
of
the
woodshed
across
the
playground
to
the
buggy
which
was
waiting
for
him
he
go
to
the
exercises
all
right
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
in
a
great
roar
he
go
if
i
have
to
buy
out
the
whole
town
to
get
him
an
outfit
and
that
whelp
wo
get
these
clothes
either
you
hear
me
say
so
he
sprang
into
the
buggy
and
holding
on
his
lap
took
up
the
reins
and
drove
rapidly
forward
they
saw
little
again
entering
the
town
hall
holding
fast
to
pond
hand
he
was
magnificent
in
a
whole
suit
of
store
clothes
coat
and
all
and
he
wore
white
stockings
and
neat
low
shoes
like
a
city
child
they
saw
him
later
up
on
the
platform
squeaking
out
his
little
patriotic
poem
his
eyes
shining
like
stars
fixed
on
one
broad
smiling
face
in
the
audience
when
he
finished
he
was
overcome
with
shyness
by
the
applause
and
for
a
moment
forgot
to
turn
and
leave
the
platform
he
hung
his
head
and
looking
out
from
under
his
eyebrows
gave
a
quaint
shy
little
smile
at
the
audience
betsy
saw
great
smile
waver
and
grow
dim
his
eyes
filled
so
full
that
he
had
to
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
blow
his
nose
loudly
and
they
saw
little
once
more
for
the
last
time
pond
buggy
drove
rapidly
past
their
pond
holding
the
reins
masterfully
in
one
hand
beside
him
very
close
sat
with
his
lap
full
of
toys
oh
full
like
christmas
in
that
fleeting
glimpse
they
saw
a
toy
train
a
stuffed
dog
a
a
pile
of
tops
and
even
the
swinging
crane
of
the
big
mechanical
toy
dredge
that
everybody
said
the
storekeeper
could
never
sell
to
anybody
because
it
cost
so
much
as
they
passed
swiftly
looked
out
at
them
and
waved
his
little
hand
flutteringly
his
other
hand
was
tightly
clasped
in
pond
big
one
he
was
smiling
at
them
all
his
eyes
looked
dazed
and
radiant
he
turned
his
head
as
the
buggy
flashed
by
to
call
out
in
a
shrill
exulting
little
shout
i
going
to
live
with
they
could
hear
no
more
he
was
gone
only
his
little
hand
still
waving
at
them
over
the
back
of
the
buggy
seat
betsy
drew
a
long
long
breath
she
found
that
ralph
was
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
she
could
think
what
made
him
look
so
different
then
she
saw
that
he
was
smiling
she
had
never
seen
him
smile
before
he
smiled
at
her
as
though
he
were
sure
she
would
understand
and
never
said
a
word
betsy
looked
forward
again
and
saw
the
gleaming
buggy
vanishing
over
the
hill
in
front
of
them
she
smiled
back
at
ralph
silently
not
a
thing
had
happened
the
way
she
had
planned
no
not
a
single
thing
but
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
never
been
so
happy
in
her
life
chapter
x
betsy
has
a
birthday
betsy
birthday
was
the
ninth
day
of
september
and
the
necronsett
valley
fair
is
always
held
from
the
eighth
to
the
twelfth
so
it
was
decided
that
betsy
should
celebrate
her
birthday
by
going
up
to
woodford
where
the
fair
was
held
the
putneys
were
going
that
year
but
the
people
on
the
next
farm
the
wendells
said
they
could
make
room
in
their
surrey
for
the
two
little
girls
for
of
course
molly
was
going
too
in
fact
she
said
the
fair
was
held
partly
to
celebrate
her
being
six
years
old
this
would
happen
on
the
seventeenth
of
october
molly
insisted
that
that
was
plenty
close
enough
to
the
ninth
of
september
to
be
celebrated
then
this
made
betsy
feel
like
laughing
out
but
observing
that
the
putneys
only
looked
at
each
other
with
the
faintest
possible
quirk
in
the
corners
of
their
serious
mouths
she
understood
that
they
were
afraid
that
molly
feelings
might
be
hurt
if
they
laughed
out
loud
so
betsy
tried
to
curve
her
young
lips
to
the
same
kind
and
secret
mirth
and
i
ca
tell
you
why
this
effort
not
to
hurt
molly
feelings
made
her
have
a
perfect
spasm
of
love
for
molly
she
threw
herself
on
her
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
that
tipped
them
both
over
on
the
couch
on
top
of
shep
who
stopped
snoring
with
his
great
gurgling
snort
wriggled
out
from
under
them
and
stood
with
laughing
eyes
and
wagging
tail
looking
at
them
as
they
rolled
and
giggled
among
the
pillows
what
dress
are
you
going
to
wear
to
the
fair
betsy
asked
cousin
ann
and
we
must
decide
about
molly
too
this
stopped
their
fun
in
short
order
and
they
applied
themselves
to
the
serious
question
of
a
toilet
when
the
great
day
arrived
and
the
surrey
drove
away
from
the
gate
betsy
was
in
a
fresh
gingham
which
she
had
helped
cousin
ann
make
and
plump
molly
looked
like
something
good
to
eat
in
a
crisp
white
little
dimity
one
of
betsy
old
dresses
with
a
deep
hem
taken
in
to
make
it
short
enough
for
the
little
because
it
was
betsy
birthday
she
sat
on
the
front
seat
with
wendell
and
part
of
the
time
when
there
were
not
too
many
teams
on
the
road
she
drove
herself
wendell
and
her
sister
filled
the
back
seat
solidly
full
from
side
to
side
and
made
one
continuous
soft
lap
on
which
molly
happily
perched
her
eyes
shining
her
round
cheeks
red
with
joyful
excitement
betsy
looked
back
at
her
several
times
and
thought
how
very
nice
molly
looked
she
had
of
course
little
idea
how
she
herself
looked
because
the
mirrors
at
putney
farm
were
all
small
and
high
up
and
anyhow
they
were
so
old
and
greenish
that
they
made
everybody
look
very
you
looked
in
them
to
see
if
your
hair
was
smooth
and
that
was
about
all
you
could
stand
so
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
betsy
later
in
the
morning
as
she
and
molly
wandered
hand
in
hand
through
the
wonders
of
industrial
hall
to
catch
sight
of
molly
in
a
mirror
as
clear
as
water
she
was
almost
startled
to
see
how
faithfully
reflected
were
the
yellow
of
the
little
girl
curls
the
clear
pink
and
white
of
her
face
and
the
blue
of
her
soft
eyes
an
older
girl
was
reflected
there
also
near
molly
a
sturdy
little
girl
standing
very
straight
on
two
strong
legs
holding
her
head
high
and
free
her
dark
eyes
looking
out
brightly
from
her
tanned
face
for
an
instant
betsy
gazed
into
those
clear
eyes
and
then
why
gracious
goodness
that
was
herself
she
was
looking
at
how
changed
she
was
how
very
very
different
she
looked
from
the
last
time
she
had
seen
herself
in
a
big
mirror
she
remembered
it
well
out
shopping
with
aunt
frances
in
a
department
store
she
had
caught
sight
of
a
pale
little
girl
with
a
thin
neck
and
spindling
legs
in
the
folds
of
aunt
frances
skirts
but
she
did
look
even
like
the
sister
of
this
browned
muscular
upstanding
child
who
held
molly
hand
so
firmly
all
this
came
into
her
mind
and
went
out
again
in
a
moment
for
molly
caught
sight
of
a
big
doll
in
the
next
aisle
and
they
hurried
over
to
inspect
her
clothing
the
mirror
was
forgotten
in
the
many
exciting
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
of
their
first
county
fair
the
two
little
girls
were
to
wander
about
as
they
pleased
until
noon
when
they
were
to
meet
the
wendells
in
the
shadow
of
industrial
hall
and
eat
their
picnic
lunch
together
the
two
parties
arrived
together
from
different
directions
having
seen
very
different
sides
of
the
fair
the
children
were
full
of
the
the
the
and
the
stands
while
the
wendells
exchanged
views
on
the
shortness
of
a
hog
legs
the
dip
in
a
cow
back
and
the
thickness
of
a
sheep
wool
the
wendells
it
seemed
had
met
some
cousins
they
did
expect
to
see
who
not
knowing
about
betsy
and
molly
had
hoped
that
they
might
ride
home
with
the
wendells
do
you
suppose
wendell
asked
betsy
that
you
and
molly
could
go
home
with
the
vaughans
they
here
in
their
big
wagon
you
could
sit
on
the
floor
with
the
vaughan
children
betsy
and
molly
thought
this
would
be
great
fun
and
agreed
enthusiastically
all
right
then
said
wendell
she
called
to
a
young
man
who
stood
inside
the
building
near
an
open
window
oh
frank
will
vaughan
is
going
to
be
in
your
booth
this
afternoon
is
he
yes
said
the
young
man
his
turn
is
from
two
to
four
well
you
tell
him
will
you
that
the
two
little
girls
who
live
at
putney
farm
are
going
to
go
home
with
them
they
can
sit
on
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
with
the
vaughan
young
ones
yes
said
the
young
man
with
a
noticeable
lack
of
interest
in
how
betsy
and
molly
got
home
now
betsy
said
wendell
you
go
round
to
that
booth
at
two
and
ask
will
vaughan
what
time
they
going
to
start
and
where
their
wagon
is
and
then
you
be
sure
not
to
keep
them
waiting
a
minute
no
i
wo
said
betsy
i
be
sure
to
be
there
on
time
she
and
molly
still
had
twenty
cents
to
spend
out
of
the
forty
they
had
brought
with
them
earned
by
and
fifteen
a
present
from
uncle
henry
they
now
put
their
heads
together
to
see
how
they
could
make
the
best
possible
use
of
their
four
nickels
cousin
ann
had
put
no
restrictions
whatever
on
them
saying
they
could
buy
any
sort
of
truck
or
rubbish
they
could
find
except
the
pink
lemonade
she
said
she
had
been
told
the
venders
washed
their
glasses
in
that
and
their
hands
and
for
all
she
knew
their
faces
betsy
was
for
but
molly
yearned
for
a
big
red
balloon
and
while
they
were
buying
that
a
man
came
by
with
toy
dogs
little
brown
dogs
with
tails
he
called
out
that
they
would
bark
when
you
pulled
their
tails
and
seeing
the
little
girls
looking
at
him
he
pulled
the
tail
of
the
one
he
held
it
gave
forth
a
fine
loud
yelp
just
like
shep
when
his
tail
got
stepped
on
betsy
bought
one
all
done
up
neatly
in
a
box
tied
with
blue
string
she
thought
it
a
great
bargain
to
get
a
dog
who
would
bark
for
five
cents
later
on
when
they
undid
the
string
and
opened
the
box
they
found
the
dog
had
one
leg
broken
off
and
would
make
the
faintest
squeak
when
his
tail
was
pulled
but
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
must
expect
to
have
happen
to
you
at
a
county
fair
now
they
had
ten
cents
left
and
they
decided
to
have
a
ride
apiece
on
the
but
glancing
up
at
the
in
the
tower
over
agricultural
hall
betsy
noticed
it
was
two
and
she
decided
to
go
first
to
the
booth
where
will
vaughan
was
to
be
and
find
out
what
time
they
would
start
for
home
she
found
the
booth
with
no
difficulty
but
william
vaughan
was
not
in
it
nor
was
the
young
man
she
had
seen
before
there
was
a
new
one
a
strange
one
a
careless
whistling
young
man
with
very
bright
socks
very
yellow
shoes
and
very
striped
cuffs
he
said
in
answer
to
betsy
inquiry
vaughan
will
vaughan
never
heard
the
name
and
immediately
went
on
whistling
and
looking
up
and
down
the
aisle
over
the
heads
of
the
little
girls
who
stood
gazing
up
at
him
with
very
wide
startled
eyes
an
older
man
leaned
over
from
the
next
booth
and
said
will
vaughan
he
from
hillsboro
well
i
heard
somebody
say
those
hillsboro
vaughans
had
word
one
of
their
cows
was
awful
sick
and
they
had
to
start
right
home
that
minute
betsy
came
to
herself
out
of
her
momentary
daze
and
snatched
hand
hurry
quick
we
must
find
the
wendells
before
they
get
away
in
her
agitation
for
she
was
really
very
much
frightened
she
forgot
how
easily
terrified
little
molly
was
her
alarm
instantly
sent
the
child
into
a
panic
oh
betsy
betsy
what
will
we
do
she
gasped
as
betsy
pulled
her
along
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
door
oh
the
wendells
ca
be
gone
yet
said
betsy
reassuringly
though
she
was
not
at
all
sure
she
was
telling
the
truth
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
drag
molly
fat
legs
to
the
where
wendell
had
tied
his
horses
and
left
the
surrey
the
was
empty
quite
empty
betsy
stopped
short
and
stood
still
her
heart
seeming
to
be
up
in
her
throat
so
that
she
could
hardly
breathe
after
all
she
was
only
ten
that
day
you
must
remember
molly
began
to
cry
loudly
hiding
her
weeping
face
in
betsy
dress
what
will
we
do
betsy
what
can
we
do
she
wailed
betsy
did
not
answer
she
did
not
know
what
they
would
do
they
were
eight
miles
from
putney
farm
far
too
much
for
molly
to
walk
and
anyhow
neither
of
them
knew
the
way
they
had
only
ten
cents
left
and
nothing
to
eat
and
the
only
people
they
knew
in
all
that
throng
of
strangers
had
gone
back
to
hillsboro
what
will
we
do
betsy
molly
kept
on
crying
out
horrified
by
silence
and
evident
consternation
the
other
child
head
swam
she
tried
again
the
formula
which
had
helped
her
when
molly
fell
into
the
wolf
pit
and
asked
herself
desperately
what
would
cousin
ann
do
if
she
were
here
but
that
did
not
help
her
much
now
because
she
could
not
possibly
imagine
what
cousin
ann
would
do
under
such
appalling
circumstances
yes
one
thing
cousin
ann
would
be
sure
to
do
of
course
she
would
quiet
molly
first
of
all
at
this
thought
betsy
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
took
the
little
girl
into
her
lap
wiping
away
the
tears
and
saying
stoutly
now
molly
stop
crying
this
minute
i
take
care
of
you
of
course
i
get
you
home
all
right
how
you
ever
do
it
sobbed
molly
everybody
gone
and
left
us
we
ca
walk
never
you
mind
how
said
betsy
trying
to
be
facetious
and
though
her
own
under
lip
was
quivering
a
little
that
my
surprise
party
for
you
just
you
wait
now
come
on
back
to
that
booth
maybe
will
vaughan
did
go
home
with
his
folks
she
had
very
little
hope
of
this
and
only
went
back
there
because
it
seemed
to
her
a
little
less
dauntingly
strange
than
every
other
spot
in
the
howling
wilderness
about
her
for
all
at
once
the
fair
which
had
seemed
so
lively
and
cheerful
and
gay
before
seemed
now
a
horrible
frightening
noisy
place
full
of
hurried
strangers
who
came
and
went
their
own
ways
with
not
a
glance
out
of
their
hard
eyes
for
two
little
girls
stranded
far
from
home
the
young
man
was
no
better
when
they
found
him
again
he
stopped
his
whistling
only
long
enough
to
say
nope
no
will
vaughan
anywhere
around
these
diggings
yet
we
were
going
home
with
the
vaughans
murmured
betsy
in
a
low
tone
hoping
for
some
help
from
him
looks
as
though
you
better
go
home
on
the
cars
advised
the
young
man
casually
he
smoothed
his
black
hair
back
straighter
than
ever
from
his
forehead
and
looked
over
their
heads
how
much
does
it
cost
to
go
to
hillsboro
on
the
cars
asked
betsy
with
a
sinking
heart
you
have
to
ask
somebody
else
about
that
said
the
young
man
what
i
do
know
about
this
rube
state
i
never
was
in
it
before
he
spoke
as
though
he
were
very
proud
of
the
fact
betsy
turned
and
went
over
to
the
older
man
who
had
told
them
about
the
vaughans
molly
trotted
at
her
heels
quite
comforted
now
that
betsy
was
talking
so
competently
to
she
did
not
hear
what
they
said
nor
try
to
now
that
betsy
voice
sounded
all
right
she
had
no
more
fears
betsy
would
manage
somehow
she
heard
betsy
voice
again
talking
to
the
other
man
but
she
was
busy
looking
at
an
exhibit
of
beautiful
jelly
glasses
and
paid
no
attention
then
betsy
led
her
away
again
out
of
doors
where
everybody
was
walking
back
and
forth
under
the
bright
september
sky
blowing
on
horns
waving
plumes
of
brilliant
tickling
each
other
with
peacock
feathers
and
eating
and
candy
out
of
paper
bags
that
reminded
molly
that
they
had
ten
cents
yet
oh
betsy
she
proposed
let
take
a
nickel
of
our
money
for
some
she
was
startled
by
betsy
fierce
sudden
clutch
at
their
little
purse
and
by
the
quaver
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
no
no
molly
got
to
save
every
cent
of
that
i
found
out
it
costs
thirty
cents
for
us
both
to
go
home
to
hillsboro
on
the
train
the
last
one
goes
at
six
we
have
got
but
ten
said
molly
betsy
looked
at
her
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
i
earn
the
rest
i
earn
it
somehow
i
have
to
there
is
any
other
way
all
right
said
molly
quaintly
not
seeing
anything
unusual
in
this
you
can
if
you
want
to
i
wait
for
you
here
no
you
wo
cried
betsy
who
had
quite
enough
of
trying
to
meet
people
in
a
crowd
no
you
wo
you
just
follow
me
every
minute
i
do
want
you
out
of
my
sight
they
began
to
move
forward
now
betsy
eyes
wildly
roving
from
one
place
to
another
how
could
a
little
girl
earn
money
at
a
county
fair
she
was
horribly
afraid
to
go
up
and
speak
to
a
stranger
and
yet
how
else
could
she
begin
here
molly
you
wait
here
she
said
do
you
budge
till
i
come
back
but
alas
molly
had
only
a
moment
to
wait
that
time
for
the
man
who
was
selling
lemonade
answered
betsy
shy
question
with
a
stare
and
a
curt
lord
no
what
could
a
young
one
like
you
do
for
me
the
little
girls
wandered
on
molly
calm
and
expectant
confident
in
betsy
betsy
with
a
very
dry
mouth
and
a
very
gone
feeling
they
were
passing
by
a
big
building
now
where
a
large
sign
proclaimed
that
the
woodford
ladies
aid
society
would
serve
a
hot
chicken
dinner
for
cents
of
course
the
sign
was
not
accurate
for
at
three
almost
four
the
chicken
dinner
had
long
ago
been
all
eaten
and
in
place
of
the
diners
was
a
group
of
weary
women
moving
languidly
about
or
standing
saggingly
by
a
great
table
piled
with
dirty
dishes
betsy
paused
here
meditated
a
moment
and
went
in
rapidly
so
that
her
courage
would
not
evaporate
the
woman
with
gray
hair
looked
down
at
her
a
little
impatiently
and
said
dinner
all
over
i
did
come
for
dinner
said
betsy
swallowing
hard
i
came
to
see
if
you
would
hire
me
to
wash
your
dishes
i
do
them
for
cents
the
woman
laughed
looked
from
little
betsy
to
the
great
pile
of
dishes
and
said
turning
away
mercy
child
if
you
washed
from
now
till
morning
you
would
make
a
hole
in
what
we
got
to
do
betsy
heard
her
say
to
the
other
women
some
young
one
wanting
more
money
for
the
now
now
was
the
moment
to
remember
what
cousin
ann
would
have
done
she
would
certainly
not
have
shaken
all
over
with
hurt
feelings
nor
have
allowed
the
tears
to
come
stingingly
to
her
eyes
so
betsy
sternly
made
herself
stop
doing
these
things
and
cousin
ann
would
have
given
way
to
the
dreadful
sinking
feeling
of
utter
discouragement
but
would
have
gone
right
on
to
the
next
place
so
although
betsy
felt
like
nothing
so
much
as
crooking
her
elbow
over
her
face
and
crying
as
hard
as
she
could
cry
she
stiffened
her
back
took
molly
hand
again
and
stepped
out
within
but
very
steady
although
rather
pale
without
she
and
molly
walked
along
in
the
crowd
again
molly
laughing
and
pointing
out
the
pranks
and
antics
of
the
young
people
who
were
feeling
livelier
than
ever
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
betsy
looked
at
them
grimly
with
unseeing
eyes
it
was
four
the
last
train
for
hillsboro
left
in
two
hours
and
she
was
no
nearer
having
the
price
of
the
tickets
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
get
her
breath
for
although
they
were
walking
slowly
she
kept
feeling
breathless
and
choked
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
ever
a
little
girl
had
had
a
more
horrible
birthday
she
never
heard
of
one
oh
i
wish
i
could
dan
said
a
young
voice
near
her
but
honest
momma
just
eat
me
up
alive
if
i
left
the
booth
for
a
minute
betsy
turned
quickly
a
very
pretty
girl
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
she
looked
as
molly
might
when
she
was
grown
up
was
leaning
over
the
edge
of
a
little
booth
the
sign
of
which
announced
that
doughnuts
and
soft
drinks
were
for
sale
there
a
young
man
very
flushed
and
gay
was
pulling
at
the
girl
blue
gingham
sleeve
oh

floor

old
thing

honest
i
love
to
but
i
got
a
great
lot
of
dishes
to
wash
too
you
know
momma
she
looked
longingly
toward
the
dancing
floor
out
from
which
just
then
floated
a
burst
of
brazen
music
oh

said
a
small
voice

for
twenty
cents
betsy
stood
by
the
girl

quivering
earnestness

surprise

years
old

spoke
with

young

repeated
betsy
trying
hard
not
to
mind
being
laughed
at
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
the
tickets
to
hillsboro
well
by
gosh
said
the
young
man
laughing
here
our
chance
annie

the
girl
laughed
too
out
of
high
spirits
would
momma
be
crazy
she
said
hilariously
but
she
never
know
here
you
cute
kid
my
apron
she
took
off
her
long
apron
and
tied
it
around
betsy
neck
there
the
soap
there
the
table
you
stack
the
dishes
up
on
that
counter
she
was
out
of
the
little
gate
in
the
counter
in
a
twinkling
just
as
molly
in
answer
to
a
beckoning
gesture
from
betsy
came
in
hello
there
another
one
said
the
gay
young
man
gayer
and
gayer
hello
button
what
you
going
to
do
i
suppose
when
they
try
to
crack
the
safe
you
run
at
them
and
bark
and
drive
them
away
molly
opened
her
sweet
blue
eyes
very
wide
not
understanding
a
single
word
the
girl
laughed
swooped
back
gave
molly
a
kiss
and
disappeared
running
side
by
side
with
the
young
man
toward
the
dance
hall
betsy
mounted
on
a
soap
box
and
began
joyfully
to
wash
the
dishes
she
had
never
thought
that
ever
in
her
life
would
she
simply
love
to
wash
dishes
beyond
anything
else
but
it
was
so
her
relief
was
so
great
that
she
could
have
kissed
the
coarse
thick
plates
and
glasses
as
she
washed
them
it
all
right
molly
it
all
right
she
quavered
exultantly
to
molly
over
her
shoulder
but
as
molly
had
not
from
the
moment
betsy
took
command
suspected
that
it
was
not
all
right
she
only
nodded
and
asked
if
she
might
sit
up
on
a
barrel
where
she
could
watch
the
crowd
go
by
i
guess
you
could
i
do
know
why
not
said
betsy
doubtfully
she
lifted
her
up
and
went
back
to
her
dishes
never
were
dishes
washed
better
two
doughnuts
please
said
a
man
voice
behind
her
oh
mercy
there
was
somebody
come
to
buy
whatever
should
she
do
she
came
forward
intending
to
say
that
the
owner
of
the
booth
was
away
and
she
did
know
anything
about
but
the
man
laid
down
a
nickel
took
two
doughnuts
and
turned
away
betsy
gasped
and
looked
at
the
sign
stuck
into
the
big
pan
of
doughnuts
sure
enough
it
read
for
she
put
the
nickel
up
on
a
shelf
and
went
back
to
her
dishwashing
selling
things
was
so
hard
she
reflected
as
her
hunted
feeling
of
desperation
relaxed
she
began
to
find
some
fun
in
her
new
situation
and
when
a
woman
with
two
little
boys
approached
she
came
forward
to
wait
on
her
elated
important
two
for
five
she
said
in
a
businesslike
tone
the
woman
put
down
a
dime
took
up
four
doughnuts
divided
them
between
her
sons
and
departed
illustration
never
were
dishes
washed
better
my
said
molly
looking
admiringly
at
betsy
coolness
over
this
transaction
betsy
went
back
to
her
dishes
stepping
high
oh
betsy
see
the
pig
the
big
ox
cried
molly
now
looking
from
her
coign
of
vantage
down
the
wide
lane
between
the
booths
betsy
craned
her
head
around
over
her
shoulder
continuing
conscientiously
to
wash
and
wipe
the
dishes
the
prize
stock
was
being
paraded
around
the
fair
the
great
prize
ox
his
shining
horns
tipped
with
blue
rosettes
the
prize
cows
with
wreaths
around
their
necks
the
prize
horses
four
or
five
of
them
as
glossy
as
satin
curving
their
bright
strong
necks
and
stepping
as
though
on
eggs
their
manes
and
tails
braided
with
bright
ribbon
and
then
oh
betsy
look
at
the
pig
screamed
molly
again
the
smaller
animals
the
sheep
the
calves
the
colts
and
the
pig
which
waddled
along
with
portly
dignity
betsy
looked
as
well
as
she
could
over
her
shoulder
and
in
years
to
come
she
can
shut
her
eyes
and
see
again
in
every
detail
that
rustic
procession
under
the
golden
september
light
but
she
looked
anxiously
at
the
clock
it
was
nearing
five
oh
suppose
the
girl
forgot
and
danced
too
long
two
bottles
of
ginger
ale
and
half
a
dozen
doughnuts
said
a
man
with
a
woman
and
three
children
betsy
looked
feverishly
among
the
bottles
ranged
on
the
counter
selected
two
marked
ginger
ale
and
glared
at
their
corrugated
tin
stoppers
how
did
you
get
them
open
here
your
opener
said
the
man
if
that
what
you
looking
for
here
you
get
the
glasses
and
i
open
the
bottles
we
in
kind
of
a
hurry
got
to
catch
a
train
well
they
were
not
the
only
people
who
had
to
catch
a
train
betsy
thought
sadly
they
drank
in
gulps
and
departed
cramming
doughnuts
into
their
mouths
betsy
wished
ardently
that
the
girl
would
come
back
she
was
now
almost
sure
that
she
had
forgotten
and
would
dance
there
till
nightfall
but
there
there
she
came
running
along
as
after
an
hour
dancing
as
when
she
had
left
the
booth
here
you
are
kid
said
the
young
man
producing
a
quarter
we
had
the
time
of
our
young
lives
thanks
to
you
betsy
gave
him
back
one
of
the
nickels
that
remained
to
her
but
he
refused
it
no
keep
the
change
he
said
royally
it
was
worth
it
then
i
buy
two
doughnuts
with
my
extra
nickel
said
betsy
no
you
wo
said
the
girl
you
take
all
you
want
for
nothing
momma
never
miss
and
what
you
sell
here
has
got
to
be
fresh
every
day
here
hold
out
your
hands
both
of
you
some
people
came
and
bought
things
said
betsy
happening
to
remember
as
she
and
molly
turned
away
the
money
is
on
that
shelf
well
now
said
the
girl
if
she
did
take
hold
and
sell
things
say
she
ran
after
betsy
and
gave
her
a
hug
you
smart
young
one
i
i
had
a
little
sister
just
like
you
molly
and
betsy
hurried
along
out
of
the
gate
into
the
main
street
of
the
town
and
down
to
the
station
molly
was
eating
doughnuts
as
she
went
they
were
both
quite
hungry
by
this
time
but
betsy
could
not
think
of
eating
till
she
had
those
tickets
in
her
hand
she
pushed
her
quarter
and
a
nickel
into
the
window
and
said
hillsboro
in
as
confident
a
tone
as
she
could
but
when
the
precious
bits
of
paper
were
pushed
out
at
her
and
she
actually
held
them
her
knees
shook
under
her
and
she
had
to
go
and
sit
down
on
the
bench
my
are
these
doughnuts
good
said
molly
i
never
in
my
life
had
enough
doughnuts
before
betsy
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
rather
languidly
to
eat
one
herself
she
felt
all
of
a
sudden
very
very
tired
she
was
tireder
still
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
at
hillsboro
station
and
started
wearily
up
the
road
toward
putney
farm
two
miles
lay
before
them
two
miles
which
they
had
often
walked
before
but
never
after
such
a
day
as
now
lay
back
of
them
molly
dragged
her
feet
as
she
walked
and
hung
heavily
on
betsy
hand
betsy
plodded
along
her
head
hanging
her
eyes
all
gritty
with
fatigue
and
sleepiness
a
light
buggy
spun
round
the
turn
of
the
road
behind
them
the
single
horse
trotting
fast
as
though
the
driver
were
in
a
hurry
the
wheels
rattling
smartly
on
the
hard
road
the
little
girls
drew
out
to
one
side
and
stood
waiting
till
the
road
should
be
free
again
when
he
saw
them
the
driver
pulled
the
horse
back
so
quickly
it
stood
almost
straight
up
he
peered
at
them
through
the
twilight
and
then
with
a
loud
shout
sprang
over
the
side
of
the
buggy
it
was
uncle
henry
oh
goody
it
was
uncle
henry
come
to
meet
them
they
would
have
to
walk
any
further
but
what
was
the
matter
with
uncle
henry
he
ran
up
to
them
exclaiming
are
ye
all
right
are
ye
all
right
he
stooped
over
and
felt
of
them
desperately
as
though
he
expected
them
to
be
broken
somewhere
and
betsy
could
feel
that
his
old
hands
were
shaking
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
when
she
said
why
yes
uncle
henry
we
all
right
we
came
home
on
the
cars
uncle
henry
leaned
up
against
the
fence
as
though
he
could
stand
up
he
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
and
he
said
it
did
seem
as
though
it
could
be
uncle
henry
talking
he
sounded
so
excited
well
well
well
by
gosh
my
well
by
thunder
now
and
so
here
ye
are
and
you
all
right
well
he
could
seem
to
stop
exclaiming
and
you
ca
imagine
anything
stranger
than
an
uncle
henry
who
could
stop
exclaiming
after
they
all
got
into
the
buggy
he
quieted
down
a
little
and
said
thunderation
but
we
had
a
scare
when
the
wendells
come
back
with
their
cousins
early
this
afternoon
they
said
you
were
coming
with
the
vaughans
and
then
when
you
did
come
and
did
come
we
telephoned
to
the
vaughans
and
they
said
they
had
seen
hide
nor
hair
of
ye
and
did
even
know
you
were
to
the
fair
at
all
i
tell
you
your
aunt
abigail
and
i
had
an
awful
turn
ann
and
i
hitched
up
scat
and
she
put
right
out
with
prince
up
toward
woodford
and
i
took
jessie
down
this
way
thought
maybe
i
get
trace
of
ye
somewhere
here
well
land
he
wiped
his
forehead
again
i
glad
to
see
you
there
get
along
jess
i
want
to
get
the
news
to
abigail
soon
as
i
can
now
tell
me
what
in
thunder
did
happen
to
you
betsy
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
straight
through
interrupted
at
first
by
indignant
comments
from
uncle
henry
who
was
outraged
by
the
wendells
loose
wearing
of
their
responsibility
for
the
children
but
as
she
went
on
he
quieted
down
to
a
closely
attentive
silence
interrupting
only
to
keep
jess
at
her
top
speed
now
that
it
was
all
safely
over
betsy
thought
her
story
quite
an
interesting
one
and
she
omitted
no
detail
although
she
wondered
once
or
twice
if
perhaps
uncle
henry
were
listening
to
her
he
kept
so
still
and
so
i
bought
the
tickets
and
we
got
home
she
ended
adding
oh
uncle
henry
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
prize
pig
he
was
too
funny
they
turned
into
the
putney
yard
now
and
saw
aunt
abigail
bulky
form
on
the
porch
got
abby
all
right
no
harm
done
shouted
uncle
henry
aunt
abigail
turned
without
a
word
and
went
back
into
the
house
when
the
little
girls
dragged
their
weary
legs
in
they
found
her
quietly
setting
out
some
supper
for
them
on
the
table
but
she
was
wiping
away
with
her
apron
the
joyful
tears
which
ran
down
her
cheeks
such
white
cheeks
it
seemed
so
strange
to
see
rosy
aunt
abigail
with
a
face
like
paper
well
i
glad
to
see
ye
she
told
them
soberly
sit
right
down
and
have
some
hot
milk
i
had
some
all
ready
the
telephone
rang
she
went
into
the
next
room
and
they
heard
her
saying
in
an
unsteady
voice
all
right
ann
they
here
your
father
just
brought
them
in
i
have
had
time
to
hear
about
what
happened
yet
but
they
all
right
you
better
come
home
that
your
cousin
ann
telephoning
from
the
marshalls
she
herself
went
and
sat
down
heavily
and
when
uncle
henry
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
she
asked
him
in
a
rather
weak
voice
for
the
ammonia
bottle
he
rushed
for
it
got
her
a
fan
and
a
drink
of
cold
water
and
hung
over
her
anxiously
till
the
color
began
to
come
back
into
her
pale
face
i
know
just
how
you
feel
mother
he
said
sympathetically
when
i
saw
standin
there
by
the
roadside
i
felt
as
though
somebody
had
hit
me
a
clip
right
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
the
little
girls
ate
their
supper
in
a
tired
daze
not
paying
any
attention
to
what
the
were
saying
until
rapid
hoofs
clicked
on
the
stones
outside
and
cousin
ann
came
in
quickly
her
black
eyes
snapping
now
for
mercy
sake
tell
me
what
happened
she
said
adding
hotly
and
if
i
do
give
that
maria
wendell
a
piece
of
my
mind
uncle
henry
broke
in
going
to
tell
what
happened
i
want
to
do
it
you
and
mother
just
listen
just
sit
right
down
and
listen
his
voice
was
shaking
with
feeling
and
as
he
went
on
and
told
of
afternoon
her
fright
her
confusion
her
forming
the
plan
of
coming
home
on
the
train
and
of
earning
the
money
for
the
tickets
he
made
for
once
no
putney
pretense
of
casual
coolness
his
old
eyes
flashed
fire
as
he
talked
betsy
watching
him
felt
her
heart
swell
and
beat
fast
in
incredulous
joy
why
he
was
proud
of
her
she
had
done
something
to
make
the
putney
cousins
proud
of
her
when
uncle
henry
came
to
the
part
where
she
went
on
asking
for
employment
after
one
and
then
another
refusal
cousin
ann
reached
out
her
long
arms
and
quickly
almost
roughly
gathered
betsy
up
on
her
lap
holding
her
close
as
she
listened
betsy
had
never
before
sat
on
cousin
ann
lap
and
when
uncle
henry
finished
he
had
not
forgotten
a
single
thing
betsy
had
told
him
and
asked
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
little
girl
ten
years
old
today
cousin
ann
opened
the
wide
and
burst
out
i
think
i
never
heard
of
a
child
doing
a
smarter
grittier
thing
and
i
do
care
if
she
does
hear
me
say
so
it
was
a
great
a
momentous
an
historic
moment
betsy
enthroned
on
those
strong
knees
wondered
if
any
little
girl
had
ever
had
such
a
beautiful
birthday
chapter
xi
understood
aunt
frances
about
a
month
after
betsy
birthday
one
october
day
when
the
leaves
were
all
red
and
yellow
two
very
momentous
events
occurred
and
in
a
manner
of
speaking
at
the
very
same
time
betsy
had
noticed
that
her
kitten
eleanor
she
still
thought
of
her
as
a
kitten
although
she
was
now
a
big
cat
spent
very
little
time
around
the
house
she
came
into
the
kitchen
two
or
three
times
a
day
mewing
loudly
for
milk
and
food
but
after
eating
very
fast
she
always
disappeared
at
once
betsy
missed
the
purring
contented
ball
of
fur
on
her
lap
in
the
long
evenings
as
she
played
checkers
or
read
aloud
or
sewed
or
played
guessing
games
she
felt
rather
hurt
too
that
eleanor
paid
her
so
little
attention
and
several
times
she
tried
hard
to
make
her
stay
trailing
in
front
of
her
a
spool
tied
to
a
string
or
rolling
a
worsted
ball
across
the
floor
but
eleanor
seemed
to
have
lost
all
her
taste
for
the
things
she
had
liked
so
much
invariably
the
moment
the
door
was
opened
she
darted
out
and
vanished
one
afternoon
betsy
ran
out
after
her
determined
to
catch
her
and
bring
her
back
when
the
cat
found
she
was
being
followed
she
bounded
along
in
great
leaps
constantly
escaping
from
betsy
outstretched
hand
they
came
thus
to
the
into
the
open
door
of
which
eleanor
whisked
like
a
little
gray
shadow
betsy
close
behind
the
cat
flashed
up
the
steep
stairs
that
led
to
the
betsy
scrambled
rapidly
up
too
it
was
dark
up
there
compared
to
the
october
day
outside
and
for
a
moment
she
could
not
see
eleanor
then
she
made
her
out
a
dim
little
shape
picking
her
way
over
the
hay
and
she
heard
her
talking
yes
it
was
real
talk
quite
quite
different
from
the
loud
imperious
miauw
with
which
eleanor
asked
for
her
milk
this
was
the
softest
prettiest
kind
of
conversation
all
little
murmurs
and
chirps
and
why
betsy
could
almost
understand
it
she
could
understand
it
enough
to
know
that
it
was
and
then
breaking
into
this
came
a
sudden
series
of
shrill
little
cries
that
fairly
filled
the
eleanor
gave
a
bound
forward
and
disappeared
betsy
very
much
excited
scrambled
and
climbed
up
over
the
hay
as
fast
as
she
could
go
it
was
all
silent
now
the
piercing
funny
little
squalls
had
stopped
as
suddenly
as
they
began
on
the
top
in
a
little
nest
lay
eleanor
purring
so
loudly
you
could
hear
her
all
over
the
big
mow
and
so
proud
and
happy
she
could
hardly
contain
herself
her
eyes
glistened
she
arched
her
back
rolled
over
and
spread
out
her
paws
disclosing
to
astounded
delighted
eyes
no
she
was
dreaming
two
dear
little
kittens
one
all
gray
just
like
its
mother
one
gray
with
a
big
bib
on
his
chest
oh
how
dear
they
were
how
darling
and
cuddly
and
fuzzy
betsy
put
her
fingers
very
softly
on
the
gray
one
head
and
thrilled
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
little
living
creature
oh
eleanor
she
asked
eagerly
can
i
pick
one
up
she
lifted
the
gray
one
gently
and
held
it
up
to
her
cheek
the
little
thing
nestled
down
in
the
warm
hollow
of
her
hand
she
could
feel
its
tiny
tiny
little
claws
pricking
softly
into
her
palm
oh
you
sweetness
you
little
little
she
said
over
and
over
in
a
whisper
eleanor
did
not
stop
purring
and
she
looked
up
with
friendly
trusting
eyes
as
her
little
mistress
made
the
acquaintance
of
her
children
but
betsy
could
feel
somehow
that
eleanor
was
anxious
about
her
kitten
was
afraid
that
although
the
little
girl
meant
everything
that
was
kind
her
great
clumsy
awkward
human
hands
were
clever
enough
to
hold
a
the
proper
way
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
eleanor
said
betsy
i
should
feel
just
so
in
your
place
there
i
wo
touch
it
again
she
laid
the
kitten
down
carefully
by
its
mother
eleanor
at
once
began
to
wash
its
face
very
vigorously
knocking
it
over
and
over
with
her
strong
tongue
my
said
betsy
laughing
you
scratch
my
eyes
out
if
were
as
rough
as
that
eleanor
did
seem
to
hear
or
rather
she
seemed
to
hear
something
else
for
she
stopped
short
her
head
lifted
her
ears
pricked
up
listening
very
hard
to
some
distant
sound
then
betsy
heard
it
too
somebody
coming
into
the
barn
below
little
quick
uneven
footsteps
it
must
be
little
molly
tagging
along
as
she
always
did
what
fun
to
show
molly
the
kittens
betsy
called
molly
from
below
molly
called
betsy
from
above
come
up
here
quick
i
got
something
up
here
there
was
a
sound
of
scrambling
rapid
feet
on
the
rough
stairs
and
molly
yellow
curls
appeared
shining
in
the
dusk
i
got
a
she
began
but
betsy
did
not
let
her
finish
come
here
molly
quick
quick
she
called
beckoning
eagerly
as
though
the
kittens
might
evaporate
into
thin
air
if
molly
did
get
there
at
once
molly
forgot
what
she
was
going
to
say
climbed
madly
up
the
steep
pile
of
hay
and
in
a
moment
was
lying
flat
on
her
stomach
beside
the
little
family
in
a
spasm
of
delight
that
satisfied
even
betsy
and
eleanor
both
of
them
convinced
that
these
were
the
finest
kittens
the
world
had
ever
seen
see
there
are
two
said
betsy
you
can
have
one
for
your
very
own
and
i
let
you
choose
which
one
do
you
like
best
she
was
hoping
that
molly
would
not
take
the
little
one
because
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
that
the
minute
she
saw
it
oh
this
one
with
the
white
on
his
breast
said
molly
without
a
moment
hesitation
it
lots
the
prettiest
oh
betsy
for
my
very
own
something
white
fell
out
of
the
folds
of
her
skirt
on
the
hay
oh
yes
she
said
indifferently
a
letter
for
you
miss
ann
told
me
to
bring
it
out
here
she
said
she
saw
you
streaking
it
for
the
barn
it
was
a
letter
from
aunt
frances
betsy
opened
it
one
eye
on
molly
to
see
that
she
did
not
hug
her
new
darling
too
tightly
and
began
to
read
it
in
the
ray
of
dusty
sunlight
slanting
in
through
a
crack
in
the
side
of
the
barn
she
could
do
this
easily
because
aunt
frances
always
made
her
handwriting
very
large
and
round
and
clear
so
that
a
little
girl
could
read
it
without
half
trying
and
as
she
read
everything
faded
away
from
before
her
the
barn
molly
the
kittens
she
saw
nothing
but
the
words
on
the
page
when
she
had
read
the
letter
through
she
got
up
quickly
oh
ever
so
quickly
and
went
away
down
the
stairs
molly
hardly
noticed
she
had
gone
so
absorbing
and
delightful
were
the
kittens
betsy
went
out
of
the
dusky
barn
into
the
rich
october
splendor
and
saw
none
of
it
she
went
straight
away
from
the
house
and
the
barn
straight
up
into
the
toward
her
favorite
place
beside
the
brook
the
shady
pool
under
the
big
at
first
she
walked
but
after
a
while
she
ran
faster
and
faster
as
though
she
could
not
get
there
soon
enough
her
head
was
down
and
one
arm
was
crooked
over
her
face
and
do
you
know
i
not
going
to
follow
her
up
there
nor
let
you
go
i
afraid
we
would
all
cry
if
we
saw
what
betsy
did
under
the
big
and
the
very
reason
she
ran
away
so
fast
was
so
that
she
could
be
all
by
herself
for
a
very
hard
hour
and
fight
it
out
alone
so
let
us
go
back
soberly
to
the
orchard
where
the
putneys
are
and
wait
till
betsy
comes
walking
listlessly
in
her
eyes
red
and
her
cheeks
pale
cousin
ann
was
up
in
the
top
of
a
tree
a
basket
hung
over
her
shoulder
half
full
of
striped
red
northern
spies
uncle
henry
was
on
a
ladder
against
another
tree
filling
a
bag
with
the
beautiful
shining
pound
sweets
and
aunt
abigail
was
moving
around
picking
up
the
windfalls
and
putting
them
into
barrels
ready
to
go
to
the
something
about
the
way
betsy
walked
and
as
she
drew
closer
something
about
the
expression
of
her
face
and
oh
as
she
began
to
speak
something
about
the
tone
of
her
voice
stopped
all
this
cheerful
activity
as
though
a
bomb
had
gone
off
in
their
midst
i
had
a
letter
from
aunt
frances
said
betsy
biting
her
lips
and
she
says
she
coming
to
take
me
away
back
to
them
tomorrow
there
was
a
big
silence
cousin
ann
stood
perfectly
motionless
up
in
her
tree
staring
down
through
the
leaves
at
betsy
uncle
henry
was
turned
around
on
his
ladder
one
hand
on
an
apple
as
though
it
had
frozen
there
staring
down
at
betsy
aunt
abigail
leaned
with
both
fat
hands
on
her
barrel
staring
hard
at
betsy
betsy
was
staring
down
at
her
shoes
biting
her
lips
and
winking
her
eyes
the
yellow
hazy
october
sun
sank
slowly
down
toward
the
rim
of
hemlock
mountain
and
sent
long
golden
shafts
of
light
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
upon
this
group
of
people
all
so
silent
so
motionless
illustration
betsy
was
staring
down
at
her
shoes
biting
her
lips
and
winking
her
eyes
betsy
was
the
first
to
speak
and
i
very
proud
of
her
for
what
she
said
she
said
loyally
dear
aunt
frances
she
was
always
so
sweet
to
me
she
always
tried
so
hard
to
take
care
of
me
for
that
was
what
betsy
had
found
up
by
the
brook
under
the
big
red
she
had
found
there
a
certainty
that
whatever
else
she
did
she
must
not
hurt
aunt
frances
feelings
dear
gentle
sweet
aunt
frances
whose
feelings
were
so
easily
hurt
and
who
had
given
her
so
many
years
of
such
anxious
care
something
up
there
had
told
her
perhaps
the
quiet
blue
shadow
of
windward
mountain
creeping
slowly
over
the
pasture
toward
her
perhaps
the
silent
glory
of
the
great
tree
perhaps
the
singing
murmur
of
the
little
brook
perhaps
all
of
them
together
had
told
her
that
now
had
come
a
time
when
she
must
do
more
than
what
cousin
ann
would
do
when
she
must
do
what
she
herself
knew
was
right
and
that
was
to
protect
aunt
frances
from
hurt
when
she
spoke
out
there
in
the
orchard
she
broke
the
spell
of
silence
cousin
ann
climbed
hastily
down
from
her
tree
with
her
basket
only
partly
filled
uncle
henry
got
stiffly
off
his
ladder
and
aunt
abigail
advanced
through
the
grass
and
they
all
said
the
same
thing
let
me
see
that
letter
they
read
it
there
looking
over
each
other
shoulders
with
grave
faces
then
still
silently
they
all
turned
and
went
back
into
the
house
leaving
their
forgotten
bags
and
barrels
and
baskets
out
under
the
trees
when
they
found
themselves
in
the
kitchen
well
suppertime
anyhow
said
cousin
ann
hastily
as
if
ashamed
of
losing
her
composure
or
almost
time
we
might
as
well
get
it
now
i
out
to
milk
said
uncle
henry
gruffly
although
it
was
not
nearly
his
usual
time
he
took
up
the
milk
pails
and
marched
out
toward
the
barn
stepping
heavily
his
head
hanging
shep
woke
up
with
a
snort
and
getting
off
the
couch
gamboled
clumsily
up
to
betsy
wagging
his
tail
and
jumping
up
on
her
ready
for
a
frolic
that
was
almost
too
much
for
betsy
to
think
that
after
tomorrow
she
would
never
see
shep
again
nor
eleanor
nor
the
kittens
she
choked
as
she
bent
over
shep
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
for
a
great
hug
but
she
must
cry
she
must
hurt
aunt
frances
feelings
or
show
that
she
was
glad
to
go
back
to
her
that
would
be
fair
after
all
aunt
frances
had
done
for
her
that
night
she
lay
awake
after
she
and
molly
had
gone
to
bed
and
molly
was
asleep
they
had
decided
not
to
tell
molly
until
the
last
minute
so
she
had
dropped
off
peacefully
as
usual
but
poor
betsy
eyes
were
wide
open
she
saw
a
gleam
of
light
under
the
door
it
widened
the
door
opened
aunt
abigail
stood
there
in
her
night
cap
mountainous
in
her
long
white
gown
a
candle
shining
up
into
her
serious
old
face
you
awake
betsy
she
whispered
seeing
the
child
dark
eyes
gleaming
at
her
over
the
covers
i
just
i
just
thought
i
look
in
to
see
if
you
were
all
right
she
came
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
set
the
candle
down
on
the
little
stand
betsy
reached
her
arms
up
longingly
and
the
old
woman
stooped
over
her
neither
of
them
said
a
single
word
during
the
long
embrace
which
followed
then
aunt
abigail
straightened
up
hastily
took
her
candle
very
quickly
and
softly
and
heavily
padded
out
of
the
room
betsy
turned
over
and
flung
one
arm
over
molly
no
molly
either
after
tomorrow
she
gulped
hard
and
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
dimly
white
in
the
starlight
a
gleam
of
light
shone
under
the
door
it
widened
and
uncle
henry
stood
there
a
candle
in
his
hand
peering
into
the
room
you
awake
betsy
he
said
cautiously
yes
i
awake
uncle
henry
the
old
man
shuffled
into
the
room
i
just
got
to
thinking
he
said
hesitating
that
maybe
you
like
to
take
my
watch
with
you
it
kind
of
handy
to
have
a
watch
on
the
train
and
i
like
real
well
for
you
to
have
it
he
laid
it
down
on
the
stand
his
own
cherished
gold
watch
that
had
been
given
him
when
he
was
betsy
reached
out
and
took
his
hard
gnarled
old
fist
in
a
tight
grip
oh
uncle
henry
she
began
and
could
not
go
on
we
miss
you
betsy
he
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
been
it
been
real
nice
to
have
you
here
and
then
he
too
snatched
up
his
candle
very
quickly
and
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
betsy
turned
over
on
her
back
no
crying
now
she
told
herself
fiercely
no
crying
now
she
clenched
her
hands
together
tightly
and
set
her
teeth
something
moved
in
the
room
somebody
leaned
over
her
it
was
cousin
ann
who
did
make
a
sound
not
one
but
who
took
betsy
in
her
strong
arms
and
held
her
close
and
closer
till
betsy
could
feel
the
quick
pulse
of
the
other
heart
beating
all
through
her
own
body
then
she
was
gone
as
silently
as
she
came
but
somehow
that
great
embrace
had
taken
away
all
the
burning
tightness
from
betsy
eyes
and
heart
she
was
very
very
tired
and
soon
after
this
she
fell
sound
asleep
snuggled
up
close
to
molly
in
the
morning
nobody
spoke
of
last
night
at
all
breakfast
was
prepared
and
eaten
and
the
team
hitched
up
directly
afterward
betsy
and
uncle
henry
were
to
drive
to
the
station
together
to
meet
aunt
frances
train
betsy
put
on
her
new
cashmere
that
cousin
ann
had
made
her
with
the
soft
white
collar
of
delicate
old
embroidery
that
aunt
abigail
had
given
her
out
of
one
of
the
trunks
in
the
attic
she
and
uncle
henry
said
very
little
as
they
drove
to
the
village
and
even
less
as
they
stood
waiting
together
on
the
platform
betsy
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
he
held
it
tight
as
the
train
whistled
in
the
distance
and
came
slowly
and
laboriously
puffing
up
to
the
station
just
one
person
got
off
at
the
little
station
and
that
was
aunt
frances
looking
ever
so
dressed
up
and
citified
with
a
fluffy
boa
and
kid
gloves
and
a
white
veil
over
her
face
and
a
big
blue
one
floating
from
her
velvet
hat
how
pretty
she
was
and
how
young
under
the
veil
which
hid
so
kindly
all
the
little
lines
in
her
sweet
thin
face
and
how
excited
and
fluttery
betsy
had
forgotten
how
fluttery
aunt
frances
was
she
clasped
betsy
to
her
and
then
started
back
crying
she
must
see
to
her
suitcase
and
then
she
clasped
betsy
to
her
again
and
shook
hands
with
uncle
henry
whose
grim
old
face
looked
about
as
cordial
and
welcoming
as
the
sourest
kind
of
sour
pickle
and
she
fluttered
back
and
said
she
must
have
left
her
umbrella
on
the
train
oh
conductor
conductor
my
umbrella
right
in
my
seat
a
blue
one
with
a
oh
here
it
is
in
my
hand
what
am
i
thinking
of
the
conductor
evidently
thought
he
better
get
the
train
away
as
soon
as
possible
for
he
now
shouted
all
aboard
to
nobody
at
all
and
sprang
back
on
the
steps
the
train
went
off
groaning
over
the
steep
grade
and
screaming
out
its
usual
echoing
warning
about
the
next
road
crossing
uncle
henry
took
aunt
frances
suitcase
and
plodded
back
to
the
surrey
he
got
into
the
front
seat
and
aunt
frances
and
betsy
in
the
back
and
they
started
off
and
now
i
want
you
to
listen
to
every
single
word
that
was
said
on
the
back
seat
for
it
was
a
very
very
important
conversation
when
fate
hung
on
the
curl
of
an
eyelash
and
the
flicker
of
a
voice
as
fates
often
do
aunt
frances
hugged
betsy
again
and
again
and
exclaimed
about
her
having
grown
so
big
and
tall
and
fat
she
did
say
brown
too
although
you
could
see
that
she
was
thinking
that
as
she
looked
through
her
veil
at
betsy
tanned
face
and
down
at
the
contrast
between
her
own
pretty
white
fingers
and
betsy
muscular
little
hands
she
exclaimed
and
exclaimed
and
kept
on
exclaiming
betsy
wondered
if
she
really
always
had
been
as
fluttery
as
this
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
came
out
the
great
news
the
reason
for
the
extra
flutteriness
aunt
frances
was
going
to
be
married
yes
think
of
it
betsy
fell
back
with
astonishment
did
betsy
think
her
aunt
frances
a
silly
old
thing
oh
aunt
frances
no
cried
betsy
fervently
you
look
just
as
young
and
pretty
lots
younger
than
i
remembered
you
aunt
frances
flushed
with
pleasure
and
went
on
you
love
your
old
aunt
frances
just
as
much
wo
you
when
she
mrs
plimpton
betsy
put
her
arms
around
her
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
i
always
love
you
aunt
frances
she
said
you
love
plimpton
too
he
so
big
and
strong
and
he
just
loves
to
take
care
of
people
he
says
that
why
he
marrying
me
you
wonder
where
we
are
going
to
live
she
asked
answering
her
own
question
quickly
we
not
going
to
live
anywhere
is
that
a
joke
plimpton
business
keeps
him
always
moving
around
from
one
place
to
another
never
more
than
a
month
anywhere
what
aunt
harriet
do
asked
betsy
wonderingly
why
she
ever
and
ever
so
much
better
said
aunt
frances
happily
and
her
own
sister
my
aunt
rachel
has
come
back
from
china
where
she
been
a
missionary
for
ever
so
long
and
the
two
old
ladies
are
going
to
keep
house
together
out
in
california
in
the
dearest
little
bungalow
all
roses
and
honeysuckle
but
you
going
to
be
with
me
wo
it
be
jolly
fun
darling
to
go
traveling
all
about
everywhere
and
see
new
places
all
the
time
now
those
are
the
words
aunt
frances
said
but
something
in
her
voice
and
her
face
suggested
a
faint
possibility
to
betsy
that
maybe
aunt
frances
did
really
think
it
would
be
such
awfully
jolly
fun
as
her
words
said
her
heart
gave
a
big
jump
up
and
she
had
to
hold
tight
to
the
arm
of
the
surrey
before
she
could
ask
in
a
quiet
voice
but
aunt
frances
wo
i
be
awfully
in
your
way
traveling
around
so
now
aunt
frances
had
ears
of
her
own
and
though
that
was
what
words
said
what
aunt
frances
heard
was
a
suggestion
that
possibly
betsy
was
as
crazy
to
leave
putney
farm
as
she
had
supposed
of
course
she
would
be
they
both
stopped
talking
for
a
moment
and
peered
at
each
other
through
the
thicket
of
words
that
held
them
apart
i
told
you
this
was
a
very
momentous
conversation
one
sure
thing
is
that
the
people
on
the
back
seat
saw
the
inside
of
the
surrey
as
they
traveled
along
and
nothing
else
red
sumac
and
bronzed
waved
their
flags
at
them
in
vain
they
kept
their
eyes
fixed
on
each
other
intently
each
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
she
hurt
the
other
feelings
after
a
pause
aunt
frances
came
to
herself
with
a
start
and
said
affectionately
putting
her
arm
around
betsy
why
you
darling
what
does
aunt
frances
care
about
trouble
if
her
own
dear
is
happy
and
betsy
said
resolutely
oh
you
know
aunt
frances
i
love
to
be
with
you
she
ventured
one
more
step
through
the
thicket
but
honestly
aunt
frances
wo
it
be
a
bother
aunt
frances
ventured
another
step
to
meet
her
but
dear
little
girls
must
be
somewhere
and
betsy
almost
forgot
her
caution
and
burst
out
but
i
could
stay
here
i
know
they
would
keep
me
even
aunt
frances
two
veils
could
not
hide
the
gleam
of
relief
and
hope
that
came
into
her
pretty
thin
sweet
face
she
summoned
all
her
courage
and
stepped
out
into
the
clearing
in
the
middle
of
the
thicket
asking
right
out
boldly
why
do
you
like
it
here
betsy
would
you
like
to
stay
and
betsy
she
never
could
remember
afterward
if
she
had
been
careful
enough
not
to
shout
too
loudly
and
joyfully
betsy
cried
out
oh
i
love
it
here
there
they
stood
face
to
face
looking
at
each
other
with
honest
and
very
happy
eyes
aunt
frances
threw
her
arm
around
betsy
and
asked
again
are
you
sure
dear
and
did
try
to
hide
her
relief
and
neither
did
betsy
i
could
visit
you
once
in
a
while
when
you
are
somewhere
near
here
suggested
betsy
beaming
oh
yes
i
must
have
some
of
the
time
with
my
darling
said
aunt
frances
and
this
time
there
was
nothing
in
their
hearts
that
contradicted
their
lips
they
clung
to
each
other
in
speechless
satisfaction
as
uncle
henry
guided
the
surrey
up
to
the
marble
betsy
jumped
out
first
and
while
uncle
henry
was
helping
aunt
frances
out
she
was
dashing
up
the
walk
like
a
crazy
thing
she
flung
open
the
front
door
and
catapulted
into
aunt
abigail
just
coming
out
it
was
like
flinging
herself
into
a
oh
oh
she
gasped
out
aunt
frances
is
going
to
be
married
and
travel
around
all
the
time
and
she
does
really
want
me
at
all
i
stay
here
ca
i
stay
here
cousin
ann
was
right
behind
aunt
abigail
and
she
heard
this
she
looked
over
their
shoulders
toward
aunt
frances
who
was
approaching
from
behind
and
said
in
her
usual
calm
and
collected
voice
how
do
you
do
frances
glad
to
see
you
frances
how
well
you
looking
i
hear
you
are
in
for
congratulations
who
the
happy
man
betsy
was
overcome
with
admiration
for
her
coolness
in
being
able
to
talk
so
in
such
an
exciting
moment
she
knew
aunt
abigail
could
have
done
it
for
she
had
sat
down
in
a
and
was
holding
betsy
on
her
lap
the
little
girl
could
see
her
wrinkled
old
hand
trembling
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
i
hope
that
means
continued
cousin
ann
going
as
usual
straight
to
the
point
that
we
can
keep
betsy
here
with
us
oh
would
you
like
to
asked
aunt
frances
fluttering
as
though
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
that
minute
would
elizabeth
ann
really
like
to
stay
oh
i
like
to
all
right
said
betsy
looking
confidently
up
into
aunt
abigail
face
aunt
abigail
spoke
now
she
cleared
her
throat
twice
before
she
could
bring
out
a
word
then
she
said
why
yes
we
kind
of
like
to
keep
her
we
sort
of
got
used
to
having
her
around
that
what
she
said
but
as
you
have
noticed
before
on
this
exciting
day
what
people
said
did
matter
as
much
as
what
they
looked
and
as
her
old
lips
pronounced
these
words
so
quietly
the
corners
of
aunt
abigail
mouth
were
twitching
and
she
was
swallowing
hard
she
said
impatiently
to
cousin
ann
hand
me
that
handkerchief
ann
and
as
she
blew
her
nose
she
said
oh
what
an
old
fool
i
am
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
as
though
a
great
fresh
breeze
had
blown
through
the
house
they
all
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
talk
loudly
and
cheerfully
about
the
weather
and
aunt
frances
trip
and
how
aunt
harriet
was
and
which
room
aunt
frances
was
to
have
and
would
she
leave
her
wraps
down
in
the
hall
or
take
them
upstairs
and
in
the
midst
of
this
betsy
her
heart
ready
to
burst
dashed
out
of
doors
followed
by
shep
she
ran
madly
toward
the
barn
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
she
only
knew
that
she
must
run
and
jump
and
shout
or
she
would
explode
shep
ran
and
jumped
because
betsy
did
to
these
two
wild
creatures
careering
through
the
air
like
autumn
leaves
appeared
little
molly
in
the
barn
door
oh
i
going
to
stay
i
going
to
stay
screamed
betsy
but
as
molly
had
not
had
any
notion
of
the
contrary
she
only
said
of
course
why
not
and
went
on
to
something
really
important
saying
in
a
very
much
capitalized
statement
my
kitten
can
walk
it
took
three
steps
just
now
after
aunt
frances
got
her
wraps
off
betsy
took
her
for
a
tour
of
inspection
they
went
all
over
the
house
first
with
special
emphasis
laid
on
the
is
this
the
loveliest
place
said
betsy
fervently
looking
about
her
at
the
white
curtains
the
bright
flowers
the
southern
sunshine
the
bookcases
and
the
bright
cooking
utensils
it
was
all
full
to
the
brim
to
her
eyes
with
happiness
and
she
forgot
entirely
that
she
had
thought
it
a
very
poor
common
kind
of
room
when
she
had
first
seen
it
nor
did
she
notice
that
aunt
frances
showed
no
enthusiasm
over
it
now
she
stopped
for
a
few
moments
to
wash
some
potatoes
and
put
them
into
the
oven
for
dinner
aunt
frances
opened
her
eyes
at
this
i
always
see
to
the
potatoes
and
the
apples
the
cooking
of
them
i
mean
explained
betsy
proudly
i
just
learned
to
make
and
brown
betty
then
down
into
the
where
aunt
abigail
was
working
over
butter
and
where
betsy
swelling
with
pride
showed
aunt
frances
how
deftly
and
smoothly
she
could
manipulate
the
wooden
paddle
and
make
rolls
of
butter
that
weighed
within
an
ounce
or
two
of
a
pound
mercy
child
think
of
your
being
able
to
do
such
things
said
aunt
frances
more
and
more
astonished
they
went
out
of
doors
now
shep
bounding
by
their
side
betsy
was
amazed
to
see
that
aunt
frances
drew
back
quite
nervously
whenever
the
big
dog
frisked
near
her
out
in
the
barn
betsy
had
a
disappointment
aunt
frances
just
balked
absolutely
at
those
stairs
oh
i
could
i
could
dear
do
you
go
up
there
is
it
quite
safe
why
aunt
abigail
went
up
there
to
see
the
kittens
cried
betsy
on
the
edge
of
exasperation
but
her
heart
softened
at
the
sight
of
aunt
frances
evident
distress
of
mind
at
the
very
idea
of
climbing
into
the
loft
and
she
brought
the
kittens
down
for
inspection
eleanor
mewing
anxiously
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
way
back
to
the
house
they
had
an
adventure
a
sort
of
adventure
and
it
brought
home
to
betsy
once
for
all
how
much
she
loved
dear
sweet
aunt
frances
and
just
what
kind
of
love
it
was
as
they
crossed
the
barnyard
the
calf
approached
them
playfully
leaping
into
the
air
and
making
a
pretense
of
butting
at
them
with
its
hornless
young
head
betsy
and
shep
often
played
with
the
calf
in
this
way
by
the
and
she
thought
nothing
of
it
now
hardly
noticed
it
in
fact
but
aunt
frances
gave
a
loud
piercing
shriek
as
though
she
were
being
cut
into
pieces
help
help
she
screamed
betsy
oh
betsy
she
had
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
could
not
take
a
single
step
forward
it
nothing
it
nothing
said
betsy
rather
impatiently
he
just
playing
we
often
play
with
him
shep
and
i
the
calf
came
a
little
nearer
with
lowered
head
get
away
said
betsy
indifferently
kicking
at
him
at
this
hint
of
masterfulness
on
betsy
part
aunt
frances
cried
out
oh
yes
betsy
do
make
him
go
away
do
make
him
go
away
it
came
over
betsy
that
aunt
frances
was
really
frightened
yes
really
and
all
at
once
her
impatience
disappeared
never
to
come
back
again
she
felt
toward
aunt
frances
just
as
she
did
toward
little
molly
and
she
acted
accordingly
she
stepped
in
front
of
aunt
frances
picked
up
a
stick
and
hit
the
calf
a
blow
on
the
neck
with
it
he
moved
away
startled
and
injured
looking
at
his
playfellow
with
reproachful
eyes
but
betsy
was
relentless
aunt
frances
must
not
be
frightened
here
shep
here
shep
she
called
loudly
and
when
the
big
dog
came
bounding
to
her
she
pointed
to
the
calf
and
said
sternly
take
him
into
the
barn
drive
him
into
the
barn
sir
shep
asked
nothing
better
than
this
command
and
charged
forward
barking
furiously
and
leaping
into
the
air
as
though
he
intended
to
eat
the
calf
up
alive
the
two
swept
across
the
barnyard
and
into
the
lower
regions
of
the
barn
in
a
moment
shep
reappeared
his
tongue
hanging
out
his
tail
wagging
his
eyes
glistening
very
proud
of
himself
and
mounted
guard
at
the
door
aunt
frances
hurried
along
desperately
through
the
gate
of
the
barnyard
as
it
fell
to
behind
her
she
sank
down
on
a
rock
breathless
still
pale
and
agitated
betsy
threw
her
arms
around
her
in
a
transport
of
affection
she
felt
that
she
understood
aunt
frances
as
nobody
else
could
the
dear
sweet
gentle
timid
aunt
she
took
the
thin
nervous
white
fingers
in
her
strong
brown
hands
oh
aunt
frances
dear
darling
aunt
frances
she
cried
how
i
wish
i
could
always
take
care
of
you
the
last
of
the
red
and
gold
leaves
were
slowly
drifting
to
the
ground
as
betsy
and
uncle
henry
drove
back
from
the
station
after
seeing
aunt
frances
off
they
were
not
silent
this
time
as
when
they
had
gone
to
meet
her
they
were
talking
cheerfully
together
laying
their
plans
for
the
winter
which
was
so
near
i
must
begin
to
bank
the
house
tomorrow
mused
uncle
henry
and
those
apples
have
got
to
go
to
the
right
off
do
you
want
to
ride
over
on
top
of
them
betsy
and
see
made
into
cider
oh
my
yes
said
betsy
that
will
be
fine
and
i
must
put
away
deborah
summer
clothes
and
get
cousin
ann
to
help
me
make
some
warm
ones
if
i
going
to
take
her
to
school
in
cold
weather
as
they
drove
into
the
yard
they
saw
eleanor
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
barn
with
something
big
and
heavy
in
her
mouth
she
held
her
head
as
high
as
she
could
but
even
so
her
burden
dragged
on
the
ground
bumping
softly
against
the
rough
places
on
the
path
look
said
betsy
just
see
that
great
rat
eleanor
has
caught
uncle
henry
squinted
his
old
eyes
toward
the
cat
for
a
moment
and
laughed
we
not
the
only
ones
that
are
getting
ready
for
winter
he
remarked
betsy
did
not
know
what
he
meant
and
climbed
hastily
over
the
wheel
and
ran
to
see
as
she
approached
eleanor
the
cat
laid
her
burden
down
with
an
air
of
relief
and
looked
trustfully
into
her
little
mistress
face
why
it
was
one
of
the
kittens
eleanor
was
bringing
it
to
the
house
oh
of
course
they
must
stay
out
there
in
that
cold
now
the
cold
weather
was
drawing
near
betsy
picked
up
the
little
sprawling
thing
trying
with
weak
legs
to
get
around
over
the
rough
ground
she
carried
it
carefully
toward
the
house
eleanor
walking
sinuously
by
her
side
and
talking
in
little
singing
purring
miauws
to
explain
her
ideas
of
betsy
felt
that
she
quite
understood
her
yes
eleanor
a
nice
little
basket
behind
the
stove
with
a
warm
piece
of
an
old
blanket
in
it
yes
i
fix
it
for
you
it
be
lovely
to
have
the
whole
family
there
and
i
bring
the
other
one
in
for
you
but
evidently
eleanor
did
not
understand
talk
as
well
as
betsy
understood
for
a
little
later
as
betsy
turned
from
the
nest
she
was
making
in
the
corner
behind
the
stove
eleanor
was
missing
and
when
she
ran
out
toward
the
barn
she
met
her
again
her
head
strained
painfully
back
dragging
another
fat
heavy
kitten
who
curled
his
pink
feet
up
as
high
as
he
could
in
a
vain
effort
not
to
have
them
knock
against
the
stones
now
eleanor
said
betsy
a
little
put
out
you
do
trust
me
enough
i
was
going
to
get
it
all
right
well
said
aunt
abigail
as
they
came
into
the
kitchen
now
you
must
begin
to
teach
them
to
drink
goodness
said
betsy
do
they
know
how
to
drink
already
you
try
them
and
see
said
aunt
abigail
with
a
mysterious
smile
so
when
uncle
henry
brought
the
pails
full
of
fragrant
warm
milk
into
the
house
betsy
poured
out
some
in
a
saucer
and
put
the
kittens
up
to
it
she
and
molly
squatted
down
on
their
heels
to
watch
and
before
long
they
were
laughing
so
that
they
were
rolling
on
the
kitchen
floor
at
first
the
kittens
looked
every
way
but
at
the
milk
seeming
to
see
everything
but
what
was
under
their
noses
then
graykin
that
was
betsy
walked
right
through
the
saucer
emerging
with
very
wet
feet
and
a
very
much
aggrieved
and
astonished
expression
molly
screamed
with
laughter
to
see
him
shake
his
little
pink
toes
and
finally
sit
down
seriously
to
lick
them
clean
then
molly
put
his
head
down
to
the
saucer
there
mine
is
smarter
than
yours
said
molly
but
went
on
putting
his
head
down
down
down
clear
into
the
milk
nearly
up
to
his
eyes
although
he
looked
very
frightened
and
miserable
then
he
jerked
it
up
quickly
and
sneezed
and
sneezed
and
sneezed
such
deliriously
funny
little
baby
sneezes
he
pawed
and
pawed
at
his
little
pink
nose
with
his
little
pink
paw
until
eleanor
took
pity
on
him
and
came
to
wash
him
off
in
the
midst
of
this
process
she
saw
the
milk
and
left
off
to
lap
it
up
eagerly
and
in
a
jiffy
she
had
drunk
every
drop
and
was
licking
the
saucer
loudly
with
her
raspy
tongue
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
kittens
first
lesson
that
evening
as
they
sat
around
the
lamp
eleanor
came
and
got
up
in
betsy
lap
just
like
old
times
betsy
was
playing
checkers
with
uncle
henry
and
interrupted
the
game
to
welcome
the
cat
back
delightedly
but
eleanor
was
uneasy
and
kept
stopping
her
toilet
to
prick
up
her
ears
and
look
restlessly
toward
the
basket
where
the
kittens
lay
curled
so
closely
together
that
they
looked
like
one
soft
ball
of
gray
fur
by
and
by
eleanor
jumped
down
heavily
and
went
back
to
the
basket
she
stayed
there
only
a
moment
standing
over
the
kittens
and
licking
them
convulsively
and
then
she
came
back
and
got
up
in
betsy
lap
again
what
ails
that
cat
said
cousin
ann
noting
this
pacing
and
restlessness
maybe
she
wants
betsy
to
hold
her
kittens
too
suggested
aunt
abigail
oh
i
love
to
said
betsy
spreading
out
her
knees
to
make
her
lap
bigger
but
i
want
my
own
myself
said
molly
looking
up
from
the
beads
she
was
stringing
well
maybe
eleanor
would
let
you
settle
it
that
way
said
cousin
ann
the
little
girls
ran
over
to
the
basket
and
brought
back
each
her
own
kitten
eleanor
watched
them
anxiously
but
as
soon
as
they
sat
down
she
jumped
up
happily
into
betsy
lap
and
curled
down
close
to
little
graykin
this
time
she
was
completely
satisfied
and
her
loud
purring
filled
the
room
with
a
peaceable
murmur
there
now
you
fixed
for
the
winter
said
aunt
abigail
by
and
by
after
cousin
ann
had
popped
some
corn
old
shep
got
off
the
couch
and
came
to
stand
by
betsy
knee
to
get
an
occasional
handful
eleanor
opened
one
eye
recognized
a
friend
and
shut
it
sleepily
but
the
little
kitten
woke
up
in
terrible
alarm
to
see
that
hideous
monster
so
near
him
and
prepared
to
sell
his
life
dearly
he
bristled
up
his
ridiculous
little
tail
opened
his
absurd
little
pink
mouth
in
a
soft
baby
and
struck
savagely
at
old
shep
face
with
a
soft
little
paw
betsy
felt
her
heart
overflow
with
amusement
and
pride
in
the
intrepid
little
morsel
she
burst
into
laughter
but
she
picked
it
up
and
held
it
lovingly
close
to
her
cheek
what
fun
it
was
going
to
be
to
see
those
kittens
grow
up
old
shep
padded
back
softly
to
the
couch
his
clicking
on
the
floor
hoisted
himself
heavily
up
and
went
to
sleep
the
kitten
subsided
into
a
ball
again
eleanor
stirred
and
stretched
in
her
sleep
and
laid
her
head
in
utter
trust
on
her
little
mistress
hand
after
that
betsy
moved
the
checkers
only
with
her
other
hand
in
the
intervals
of
the
game
while
uncle
henry
was
pondering
over
his
moves
the
little
girl
looked
down
at
her
pets
and
listened
absently
to
the
keen
autumnal
wind
that
swept
around
the
old
house
shaking
the
shutters
and
rattling
the
windows
a
stick
of
wood
in
the
stove
burned
in
two
and
fell
together
with
a
soft
whispering
sound
the
lamp
cast
a
steady
radiance
on
uncle
henry
bent
seriously
over
the
on
molly
blooming
round
cheeks
and
bright
hair
on
aunt
abigail
rosy
cheerful
wrinkled
old
face
and
on
cousin
ann
quiet
clear
dark
eyes
that
room
was
full
to
the
brim
of
something
beautiful
and
betsy
knew
what
it
was
its
name
was
happiness
the
end
