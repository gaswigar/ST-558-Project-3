the
street
of
seven
stars
by
mary
roberts
rinehart
chapter
i
the
old
stucco
house
sat
back
in
a
garden
or
what
must
once
have
been
a
garden
when
that
part
of
the
austrian
city
had
been
a
royal
game
preserve
tradition
had
it
that
the
empress
maria
theresa
had
used
the
building
as
a
and
undoubtedly
there
was
something
royal
in
the
proportions
of
the
salon
with
all
the
candles
lighted
in
the
great
glass
chandelier
and
no
sidelights
so
that
the
broken
paneling
was
mercifully
obscured
by
gloom
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
the
great
empress
herself
had
sat
in
one
of
the
tall
old
chairs
and
listened
to
anecdotes
of
questionable
character
even
if
tradition
may
be
believed
related
not
a
few
herself
the
chandelier
was
not
lighted
on
this
rainy
november
night
outside
in
the
garden
the
trees
creaked
and
bent
before
the
wind
and
the
heavy
barred
gate
left
open
by
the
last
comer
a
piano
student
named
scatchett
and
dubbed
scatch
the
gate
slammed
to
and
fro
monotonously
giving
now
and
then
just
enough
pause
for
a
hope
that
it
had
latched
itself
a
hope
that
was
always
destroyed
by
the
next
gust
one
candle
burned
in
the
salon
originally
lighted
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
miss
scatchett
to
locate
the
score
of
a
tschaikowsky
concerto
it
had
been
moved
to
the
small
center
table
and
had
served
to
give
light
if
not
festivity
to
the
afternoon
coffee
and
cakes
it
still
burned
a
gnarled
and
stubby
fragment
in
its
china
holder
round
it
the
disorder
of
the
recent
refreshment
three
empty
cups
a
half
of
a
small
cake
a
crumpled
napkin
or
two
there
were
never
enough
to
go
round
and
on
the
floor
the
score
of
the
concerto
clearly
abandoned
for
the
things
of
the
flesh
the
room
was
cold
the
long
casement
windows
creaked
in
time
with
the
slamming
of
the
gate
and
the
candle
flickered
in
response
to
a
draft
under
the
doors
the
concerto
flapped
and
slid
along
the
uneven
old
floor
at
the
sound
a
girl
in
a
black
dress
who
had
been
huddled
near
the
tile
stove
rose
impatiently
and
picked
it
up
there
was
no
impatience
however
in
the
way
she
handled
the
loose
sheets
she
put
them
together
carefully
almost
tenderly
and
placed
them
on
the
top
of
the
grand
piano
anchoring
them
against
the
draft
with
a
china
dog
from
the
stand
the
room
was
very
bare
a
long
mirror
between
two
of
the
windows
half
a
dozen
chairs
a
stand
or
two
and
in
a
corner
the
grand
piano
there
were
no
rugs
the
bare
floor
stretched
bleakly
into
dim
corners
and
was
lost
the
crystal
pendants
of
the
great
chandelier
looked
like
stalactites
in
a
cave
the
girl
touched
the
piano
keys
they
were
ice
under
her
fingers
in
a
sort
of
desperation
she
drew
a
chair
underneath
the
chandelier
and
armed
with
a
handful
of
matches
proceeded
to
the
extravagance
of
lighting
it
not
here
and
there
but
throughout
as
high
as
she
could
reach
standing
perilously
on
her
tiptoes
on
the
chair
the
resulting
illumination
revealed
a
number
of
things
it
showed
that
the
girl
was
young
and
comely
and
that
she
had
been
crying
it
revealed
the
fact
that
the
was
empty
and
the
stove
almost
so
it
let
the
initiated
into
the
secret
that
the
blackish
fluid
in
the
cups
had
been
made
with
coffee
extract
that
had
been
made
of
heaven
knows
what
and
it
revealed
in
the
cavernous
corner
near
the
door
a
number
of
trunks
the
girl
having
lighted
all
the
candles
stood
on
the
chair
and
looked
at
the
trunks
she
was
very
young
very
tragic
very
feminine
a
door
slammed
down
the
hall
and
she
stopped
crying
instantly
diving
into
one
of
those
receptacles
that
are
a
part
of
the
mystery
of
the
sex
she
rubbed
a
chamois
skin
over
her
nose
and
her
reddened
eyelids
the
situation
was
a
difficult
one
but
hardly
except
to
harmony
wells
a
tragedy
few
of
us
are
so
constructed
that
the
suite
arlesienne
will
serve
as
a
luncheon
or
a
faulty
fingering
of
the
waldweben
from
siegfried
will
keep
us
awake
at
night
harmony
had
lain
awake
more
than
once
over
some
crime
against
her
namesake
had
paid
penances
of
early
rising
and
two
hours
of
scales
before
breakfast
working
with
stiffened
fingers
in
her
cold
little
room
where
there
was
no
room
for
a
stove
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
a
faded
kimono
where
once
pink
butterflies
sported
in
a
once
garden
then
coffee
rolls
and
honey
and
back
again
to
work
with
little
scatchett
at
the
piano
in
the
salon
beyond
the
partition
wearing
a
sweater
and
fingerless
gloves
and
holding
a
bottle
on
her
knees
three
rooms
beyond
down
the
stone
hall
the
big
soprano
doing
madama
butterfly
in
bad
german
helped
to
make
an
encircling
wall
of
sound
in
the
center
of
which
one
might
practice
peacefully
only
the
portier
objected
morning
after
morning
crawling
out
at
dawn
from
under
his
featherbed
in
the
lodge
below
he
opened
his
door
and
listened
to
harmony
doing
penance
above
and
morning
after
morning
he
shook
his
fist
up
the
stone
staircase
gott
im
himmel
he
would
say
to
his
wife
fumbling
with
the
knot
of
his
mustache
bandage
what
a
people
these
americans
so
much
noise
and
no
music
and
mad
grumbled
his
wife
all
the
day
coal
coal
to
heat
and
at
night
the
windows
open
karl
the
milkboy
has
seen
and
now
the
little
colony
was
breaking
up
the
big
soprano
was
going
back
to
her
church
grand
opera
having
found
no
place
for
her
scatch
was
returning
to
be
married
her
heart
full
indeed
of
music
but
her
head
much
occupied
with
the
trousseau
in
her
trunks
the
harmar
sisters
had
gone
two
weeks
before
their
funds
having
given
out
indeed
funds
were
very
low
with
all
of
them
the
bitte
zum
speisen
of
the
little
german
maid
often
called
them
to
nothing
more
opulent
than
a
stew
of
beef
and
carrots
not
that
all
had
been
sordid
the
butter
had
gone
for
opera
tickets
and
never
was
butter
better
spent
and
there
had
been
gala
days
a
fruitcake
from
harmony
mother
a
venison
steak
at
christmas
and
once
or
twice
on
birthdays
real
american
ice
cream
at
a
fabulous
price
and
worth
it
harmony
had
bought
a
suit
too
a
marvel
of
tailoring
and
cheapness
and
a
willow
plume
that
would
have
cost
treble
its
price
in
new
york
oh
yes
gala
days
indeed
to
offset
the
butter
and
the
rainy
winter
and
the
faltering
technic
and
the
anxiety
about
money
for
that
they
all
had
always
the
old
tragedy
of
the
american
music
student
abroad
the
expensive
lessons
the
delays
in
getting
to
the
master
himself
the
contention
against
german
greed
or
austrian
whim
and
always
back
in
one
mind
the
home
people
to
whom
one
dares
not
confess
that
after
nine
months
of
waiting
or
a
year
one
has
seen
the
master
once
or
not
at
all
or
and
one
of
the
harmar
girls
had
carried
back
this
scar
in
her
soul
to
go
back
rejected
as
one
of
the
unfit
on
whom
even
the
undermasters
refuse
to
waste
time
that
has
been
and
often
harmony
stood
on
her
chair
and
looked
at
the
trunks
the
big
soprano
was
calling
down
the
hall
scatch
she
was
shouting
briskly
where
is
my
hairbrush
a
wail
from
scatch
from
behind
a
closed
door
i
packed
it
heaven
knows
where
do
you
need
it
really
have
you
got
a
comb
as
soon
as
i
get
something
on
i
coming
to
shake
you
half
the
teeth
are
out
of
my
comb
i
do
believe
you
packed
it
look
under
the
silence
for
a
moment
while
scatch
obeyed
for
the
next
moment
here
it
is
she
called
joyously
and
here
are
harmony
bedroom
slippers
oh
harry
i
found
your
slippers
the
girl
got
down
off
the
chair
and
went
to
the
door
thanks
dear
she
said
i
coming
in
a
she
went
to
the
mirror
which
had
reflected
the
empress
maria
theresa
and
looked
at
her
eyes
they
were
still
red
perhaps
if
she
opened
the
window
the
air
would
brighten
them
armed
with
the
brush
little
scatchett
hurried
to
the
big
room
she
flung
the
brush
on
the
bed
and
closed
the
door
she
held
her
shabby
wrapper
about
her
and
listened
just
inside
the
door
there
were
no
footsteps
only
the
banging
of
the
gate
in
the
wind
she
turned
to
the
big
soprano
heating
a
curling
iron
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
held
out
her
hand
look
she
said
under
my
bed
ten
kronen
without
a
word
the
big
soprano
put
down
her
and
ponderously
getting
down
on
her
knees
candle
in
hand
inspected
the
dusty
floor
beneath
her
bed
it
revealed
nothing
but
a
cigarette
on
which
she
pounced
still
squatting
she
lighted
the
cigarette
in
the
candle
flame
and
sat
solemnly
puffing
it
the
first
for
a
week
she
said
pull
out
the
wardrobe
scatch
there
may
be
another
relic
of
my
prosperous
but
little
scatchett
was
not
interested
in
austrian
cigarettes
with
a
government
monopoly
and
gilt
tips
she
was
looking
at
the
piece
where
is
the
other
she
asked
in
a
whisper
in
my
little
scatchett
lifted
the
china
lid
and
dropped
the
tiny
every
little
bit
she
said
flippantly
but
still
in
a
whisper
added
to
what
she
got
makes
just
a
little
bit
have
you
thought
of
a
place
to
leave
it
for
her
if
rosa
finds
it
it
heaven
knows
it
was
hard
enough
to
get
together
without
losing
it
now
i
have
to
jump
overboard
and
swim
ashore
at
new
york
i
have
even
a
dollar
for
new
york
said
little
scatchett
with
her
eyes
glowing
if
henry
meets
me
i
know
he
will
tut
the
big
soprano
got
up
cumbrously
and
stood
looking
down
you
and
your
henry
scatchy
child
has
it
occurred
to
your
maudlin
young
mind
that
money
is
the
only
thing
harmony
is
going
to
need
going
to
be
alone
and
this
is
a
bad
town
to
be
alone
in
and
she
is
not
like
us
you
have
your
henry
i
a
beefy
person
who
has
a
stomach
and
i
thankful
for
it
but
she
is
different
she
got
the
thing
that
you
are
as
well
without
the
thing
that
my
lack
of
is
sending
me
back
to
fight
in
a
church
choir
instead
of
grand
little
scatchett
was
rather
puzzled
temperament
she
asked
it
had
always
been
accepted
in
the
little
colony
that
harmony
was
a
real
musician
a
star
in
their
lesser
firmament
the
big
soprano
sniffed
if
you
like
she
said
soul
is
a
better
word
only
the
rich
ought
to
have
souls
scatchy
this
was
over
the
younger
girl
head
and
anyhow
harmony
was
coming
down
the
hall
i
thought
under
her
pillow
she
whispered
she
find
it
harmony
came
in
to
find
the
big
soprano
heating
a
curler
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
chapter
ii
harmony
found
the
little
hoard
under
her
pillow
that
night
when
having
seen
scatch
and
the
big
soprano
off
at
the
station
she
had
come
back
alone
to
the
apartment
on
the
siebensternstrasse
the
trunks
were
gone
now
only
the
concerto
score
still
lay
on
the
piano
where
little
scatchett
mentally
on
the
dock
at
new
york
with
henry
arms
about
her
had
forgotten
it
the
candles
in
the
great
chandelier
had
died
in
tears
of
paraffin
that
spattered
the
floor
beneath
one
or
two
of
the
sockets
were
still
smoking
and
the
sharp
odor
of
burning
wickends
filled
the
room
harmony
had
come
through
the
garden
quickly
she
had
had
an
uneasy
sense
of
being
followed
and
the
garden
with
its
moaning
trees
and
slamming
gate
and
the
great
dark
house
in
the
background
was
a
forbidding
place
at
best
she
had
rung
the
bell
and
had
stood
her
back
against
the
door
eyes
and
ears
strained
in
the
darkness
she
had
fancied
that
a
figure
had
stopped
outside
the
gate
and
stood
looking
in
but
the
next
moment
the
gate
had
swung
to
and
the
portier
was
fumbling
at
the
lock
behind
her
the
portier
had
put
on
his
trousers
over
his
night
garments
and
his
mustache
bandage
gave
him
a
sinister
expression
rather
augmented
when
he
smiled
at
her
the
portier
liked
harmony
in
spite
of
the
early
morning
practicing
she
looked
like
a
singer
at
the
opera
for
whom
he
cherished
a
hidden
attachment
the
singer
had
never
seen
him
but
it
was
for
her
he
wore
the
mustache
bandage
perhaps
some
day
hopefully
one
must
be
ready
the
portier
gave
harmony
a
tiny
candle
and
harmony
held
out
his
tip
the
five
hellers
of
custom
but
the
portier
was
keen
and
rosa
was
a
niece
of
his
wife
and
talked
more
than
she
should
he
refused
the
tip
with
a
gesture
bitte
fraulein
he
said
through
the
bandage
it
is
for
me
a
pleasure
to
admit
you
and
perhaps
if
the
fraulein
is
cold
a
basin
of
the
portier
was
not
pleasant
to
the
eye
his
nightshirt
was
open
over
his
hairy
chest
and
his
feet
were
bare
to
the
stone
floor
but
to
harmony
that
lonely
night
he
was
beautiful
she
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
but
she
held
out
her
hand
in
impulsive
gratitude
and
the
portier
in
his
best
manner
bent
over
and
kissed
it
as
she
reached
the
curve
of
the
stone
staircase
carrying
her
tiny
candle
the
portier
was
following
her
with
his
eyes
she
was
very
like
the
girl
of
the
opera
the
clang
of
the
door
below
and
the
rattle
of
the
chain
were
comforting
to
harmony
ears
from
the
safety
of
the
darkened
salon
she
peered
out
into
the
garden
again
but
no
skulking
figure
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
and
the
gate
remained
for
a
marvel
closed
it
was
when
having
picked
up
her
violin
in
a
very
passion
of
loneliness
only
to
put
it
down
when
she
found
that
the
familiar
sounds
echoed
and
reechoed
sadly
through
the
silent
rooms
it
was
when
she
was
ready
for
bed
that
she
found
the
money
under
her
pillow
and
a
scrawl
from
scatchy
a
breathless
apologetic
scrawl
little
scatchett
having
adored
her
from
afar
as
the
plain
adore
the
beautiful
the
mediocre
the
gifted
dearest
harry
here
a
large
blot
scatchy
being
addicted
to
blots
i
am
honestly
frightened
when
i
think
what
we
are
doing
but
oh
my
dear
if
you
could
know
how
pleased
we
are
with
ourselves
you
not
deny
us
this
pleasure
harry
you
have
it
the
real
thing
you
know
whatever
it
is
and
i
have
none
of
the
rest
of
us
had
and
you
must
stay
to
go
now
just
when
lessons
would
mean
everything
well
you
must
not
think
of
it
we
have
scads
to
take
us
home
more
than
we
need
both
of
us
or
at
least
well
i
lying
and
you
know
it
but
we
have
enough
by
being
careful
and
we
want
you
to
have
this
it
is
much
but
it
may
help
ten
kronen
of
it
i
found
under
my
bed
and
it
may
be
yours
anyhow
sadie
sadie
was
the
big
soprano
keeps
saying
awful
things
about
our
leaving
you
here
and
she
has
rather
terrified
me
you
are
so
beautiful
harry
although
you
never
let
us
tell
you
so
and
sadie
says
you
have
a
soul
and
i
have
and
that
souls
are
deadly
things
to
have
i
feel
that
in
urging
you
to
stay
i
am
taking
the
burden
of
your
soul
on
me
do
be
careful
harry
if
any
one
you
do
not
know
speaks
to
you
call
a
policeman
and
be
sure
you
get
into
a
respectable
pension
there
are
queer
ones
sadie
and
i
think
that
if
you
can
get
along
on
what
you
get
from
home
you
said
your
mother
would
get
insurance
did
you
and
will
keep
this
as
a
sort
of
fund
to
take
you
home
if
anything
should
go
wrong
but
perhaps
we
are
needlessly
worried
in
any
case
of
course
it
a
loan
and
you
can
preserve
that
magnificent
independence
of
yours
by
sending
it
back
when
you
get
to
work
to
make
your
fortune
and
if
you
are
doubtful
at
all
just
remember
that
hopeful
little
mother
of
yours
who
sent
you
over
to
get
what
she
had
never
been
able
to
have
for
herself
and
who
planned
this
for
you
from
the
time
you
were
a
kiddy
and
she
named
you
harmony
i
not
saying
i
ca
that
night
while
the
portier
and
his
wife
slept
under
their
crimson
feather
beds
and
the
crystals
of
the
chandelier
in
the
salon
shook
in
the
draft
as
if
the
old
austrian
court
still
danced
beneath
harmony
fought
her
battle
and
a
battle
it
was
scatchy
and
the
big
soprano
had
not
known
everything
there
had
been
no
insurance
on
her
father
life
the
little
mother
was
penniless
a
married
sister
would
care
for
her
but
what
then
harmony
had
enough
remaining
of
her
letter
of
credit
to
take
her
home
and
she
had
the
hoard
under
the
pillow
to
go
back
and
teach
the
violin
or
to
stay
and
finish
under
the
master
be
presented
as
he
had
promised
her
at
a
special
concert
in
vienna
with
all
the
prestige
at
home
that
that
would
mean
and
its
resulting
possibility
of
fame
and
fortune
which
she
decided
to
stay
there
might
be
a
concert
or
so
and
she
could
teach
english
the
viennese
were
crazy
about
english
some
of
the
stores
advertised
english
that
would
be
something
to
fall
back
on
a
clerkship
during
the
day
toward
dawn
she
discovered
that
she
was
very
cold
and
she
went
into
the
big
soprano
deserted
and
disordered
room
the
tile
stove
was
warm
and
comfortable
but
on
the
toilet
table
there
lay
a
disreputable
comb
with
most
of
the
teeth
gone
harmony
kissed
this
unromantic
object
which
reveals
the
fact
that
genius
or
not
she
was
only
a
young
and
rather
frightened
girl
and
that
every
atom
of
her
ached
with
loneliness
she
did
not
sleep
at
all
but
sat
curled
up
on
the
bed
with
her
feet
under
her
and
thought
things
out
at
dawn
the
portier
crawling
out
into
the
cold
from
under
his
feathers
opened
the
door
into
the
hall
and
listened
she
was
playing
not
practicing
and
the
music
was
the
barcarolle
from
the
tales
of
hoffmann
standing
in
the
doorway
in
his
night
attire
his
chest
open
to
the
frigid
morning
air
his
face
upraised
to
the
floor
above
he
hummed
the
melody
in
a
throaty
tenor
when
the
music
had
died
away
he
went
in
and
closed
the
door
sheepishly
his
wife
stood
over
the
stove
a
stick
of
firewood
in
her
hand
she
eyed
him
so
it
is
the
american
fraulein
now
i
did
but
hum
a
little
she
drags
out
my
heart
with
her
he
fumbled
with
his
mustache
bandage
which
was
knotted
behind
keeping
one
eye
on
his
wife
whose
morning
pleasure
it
was
to
untie
it
for
him
she
leaves
she
announced
ignoring
the
knot
why
she
is
alone
rosa
says
she
leaves
the
knot
was
hopeless
now
and
pulled
to
smooth
compactness
the
portier
jerked
at
it
no
fraulein
stays
here
alone
it
is
not
respectable
and
what
saw
i
last
night
after
she
entered
and
you
stood
up
the
stair
after
her
a
man
in
the
gateway
the
portier
was
angry
he
snarled
something
through
the
bandage
which
had
slipped
down
over
his
mouth
and
picked
up
a
great
knife
she
will
stay
if
she
so
desire
he
muttered
furiously
and
raising
the
knife
he
cut
the
knotted
string
his
mustache
faintly
gray
and
sweetly
stood
revealed
she
will
stay
he
repeated
and
when
you
see
men
at
the
gate
let
me
know
she
is
an
angel
and
she
looks
like
the
angel
at
the
opera
hein
this
was
a
crushing
blow
the
portier
wilted
such
things
come
from
telling
one
cousin
who
keeps
a
brushshop
what
is
in
one
heart
yesterday
his
wife
had
needed
a
brush
and
himmel
the
girl
must
go
harmony
knew
also
that
she
must
go
the
apartment
was
large
and
expensive
rosa
ate
much
and
wasted
more
she
must
find
somewhere
a
tiny
room
with
board
a
humble
little
room
but
with
a
stove
it
is
folly
to
practice
with
stiffened
fingers
a
room
where
her
playing
would
not
annoy
people
that
was
important
she
paid
rosa
off
that
morning
out
of
money
left
for
that
purpose
rosa
wept
she
said
she
would
stay
with
the
fraulein
for
her
keep
because
it
was
not
the
custom
for
young
ladies
to
be
alone
in
the
city
young
girls
of
the
people
of
course
but
beautiful
young
ladies
no
harmony
gave
her
an
extra
krone
or
two
out
of
sheer
gratitude
but
she
could
not
keep
her
and
at
noon
having
packed
her
trunk
she
went
down
to
interview
the
portier
and
his
wife
who
were
agents
under
the
owner
for
the
old
house
the
portier
entirely
subdued
was
sweeping
out
the
hallway
he
looked
past
the
girl
not
at
her
and
observed
impassively
that
the
lease
was
up
and
it
was
her
privilege
to
go
in
the
daylight
she
was
not
so
like
the
angel
and
after
all
she
could
only
play
the
violin
the
angel
had
a
voice
such
a
voice
and
besides
there
was
an
eye
at
the
crack
of
the
door
the
bit
of
cheer
of
the
night
before
was
gone
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
harmony
started
on
her
quest
for
cheaper
quarters
winter
which
had
threatened
for
a
month
had
come
at
last
the
cobblestones
glittered
with
ice
and
the
small
puddles
in
the
gutters
were
frozen
across
the
street
a
spotted
deer
shot
in
the
mountains
the
day
before
and
hanging
from
a
hook
before
a
shop
was
frozen
quite
stiff
it
was
a
pretty
creature
the
girl
turned
her
eyes
away
a
young
man
buying
cheese
and
tinned
fish
in
the
shop
watched
after
her
that
an
american
girl
is
it
he
asked
in
the
shopkeeper
was
voluble
also
rosa
had
bought
much
from
him
and
rosa
talked
when
the
american
left
the
shop
he
knew
everything
of
harmony
that
rosa
knew
except
her
name
rosa
called
her
the
beautiful
also
he
was
short
one
krone
four
beliers
in
his
change
which
is
readily
done
when
a
customer
is
plainly
thinking
of
a
beautiful
harmony
searched
all
day
for
the
little
room
with
board
and
a
stove
and
no
objection
to
practicing
there
were
plenty
but
the
rates
the
willow
plume
looked
prosperous
and
she
had
a
way
of
making
the
plainest
garments
appear
costly
landladies
looked
at
the
plume
and
the
suit
and
heard
the
soft
swish
of
silk
beneath
which
marks
only
in
the
american
woman
but
is
extravagance
in
europe
and
added
to
their
regular
terms
until
poor
harmony
heart
almost
stood
still
and
then
at
last
toward
evening
she
happened
on
a
gloomy
little
pension
near
the
corner
of
the
alserstrasse
and
it
being
dark
and
the
plume
not
showing
and
the
landlady
missing
the
rustle
owing
to
cotton
in
her
ears
for
earache
harmony
found
terms
that
she
could
meet
for
a
time
a
mean
little
room
enough
but
with
a
stove
the
bed
sagged
in
the
center
and
the
toilet
table
had
a
mirror
that
made
one
eye
appear
higher
than
the
other
and
twisted
one
nose
but
there
was
an
odor
of
stewing
cabbage
in
the
air
also
alas
there
was
the
odor
of
many
previous
stewed
cabbages
and
of
dusty
carpets
and
stale
tobacco
harmony
had
had
no
lunch
she
turned
rather
faint
she
arranged
to
come
at
once
and
got
out
into
the
comparative
purity
of
the
staircase
atmosphere
and
felt
her
way
down
she
reeled
once
or
twice
at
the
bottom
of
the
dark
stairs
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
eyes
closed
to
the
dismay
of
a
young
man
who
had
just
come
in
with
a
cheese
and
some
tinned
fish
under
his
arm
he
put
down
his
packages
on
the
stone
floor
and
caught
her
arm
not
ill
are
you
he
asked
in
english
and
then
remembering
bist
du
krank
he
colored
violently
at
that
recalling
too
late
the
familiarity
of
the
harmony
smiled
faintly
only
tired
she
said
in
english
and
the
odor
of
cabbage
her
color
had
come
back
and
she
freed
herself
from
his
supporting
hand
he
whistled
softly
he
had
recognized
her
cabbage
of
course
he
said
the
pension
upstairs
is
full
of
it
i
live
there
and
i
eaten
so
much
of
it
i
could
be
served
up
with
i
am
going
to
live
there
is
it
as
bad
as
that
he
waved
a
hand
toward
the
parcels
on
the
floor
so
bad
he
observed
that
i
keep
body
and
soul
together
by
buying
strong
and
odorous
food
at
the
delicatessens
odorous
because
only
rugged
flavors
rise
above
the
atmosphere
up
there
cheese
is
the
only
thing
that
really
knocks
out
the
cabbage
and
once
or
twice
even
cheese
has
retired
but
i
do
like
in
sheer
relief
from
the
loneliness
of
the
day
her
spirits
were
rising
then
coffee
but
not
there
coffee
at
the
on
the
corner
i
say
he
hesitated
yes
would
you
do
you
think
a
cup
of
coffee
would
set
you
up
a
bit
it
sounds
attractive
uncertainly
coffee
with
whipped
cream
and
some
little
cakes
harmony
hesitated
in
the
gloom
of
the
hall
she
could
hardly
see
this
brisk
young
american
young
she
knew
by
his
voice
tall
by
his
silhouette
strong
by
the
way
he
had
caught
her
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
liked
his
voice
do
you
mean
with
you
i
a
doctor
i
am
going
to
fill
my
own
that
sounded
reassuring
doctors
were
not
as
other
men
they
were
legitimate
friends
in
need
i
am
sure
it
is
not
proper
but
proper
of
course
it
is
i
shall
send
you
a
bill
for
professional
services
besides
wo
we
be
formally
introduced
by
the
landlady
come
now
to
the
and
the
paris
edition
of
the
but
the
next
moment
he
paused
and
ran
his
hand
over
his
chin
i
pretty
disreputable
he
explained
i
have
been
in
a
clinic
all
day
and
hang
it
all
i
not
what
difference
does
that
make
my
dear
young
lady
he
explained
gravely
picking
up
the
cheese
and
the
tinned
fish
it
makes
a
difference
in
me
that
i
wish
you
to
realize
before
you
see
me
in
a
strong
he
rapped
at
the
portier
door
with
the
intention
of
leaving
his
parcels
there
but
receiving
no
reply
tucked
them
under
his
arm
a
moment
later
harmony
was
in
the
open
air
rather
dazed
a
bit
excited
and
lovely
with
the
color
the
adventure
brought
into
her
face
her
companion
walked
beside
her
tall
slightly
stooped
she
essayed
a
fugitive
little
up
at
him
and
meeting
his
eyes
hastily
averted
hers
they
passed
a
policeman
and
suddenly
there
flashed
into
the
girl
mind
little
scatchett
letter
do
be
careful
harry
if
any
one
you
do
not
know
speaks
to
you
call
a
chapter
iii
the
was
warm
and
bright
round
its
small
tables
were
gathered
miscellaneous
groups
here
and
there
a
woman
but
mostly
men
uniformed
officers
who
made
of
the
neighborhood
a
sort
of
club
where
under
their
breath
they
criticized
the
government
and
retailed
small
regimental
gossip
professors
from
the
university
still
wearing
under
the
beards
of
middle
life
the
fine
horizontal
scars
of
student
days
elderly
doctors
from
the
general
hospital
across
the
street
even
a
hofrath
or
two
drinking
beer
and
reading
the
fliegende
blaetter
and
simplicissimus
and
in
an
alcove
round
a
billiard
table
a
group
of
noisy
korps
students
over
all
a
permeating
odor
of
coffee
strong
black
coffee
made
with
a
fig
or
two
to
give
it
color
it
rose
even
above
the
blue
tobacco
haze
and
dominated
the
atmosphere
with
its
spicy
and
stimulating
richness
a
bustle
of
waiters
a
hum
of
conversation
the
rattle
of
newspapers
and
the
click
of
billiard
balls
this
was
the
harmony
had
never
been
inside
one
before
the
little
music
colony
had
been
a
corporation
retaining
its
american
integrity
in
spite
of
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
and
three
expensive
lessons
a
week
in
german
harmony
knew
the
art
galleries
and
the
churches
which
were
free
and
the
opera
thanks
to
no
butter
at
supper
but
of
that
backbone
of
austrian
life
the
she
was
profoundly
ignorant
her
companion
found
her
a
seat
in
a
corner
near
a
heater
and
disappeared
for
an
instant
on
the
search
for
the
paris
edition
of
the
the
girl
followed
him
with
her
eyes
seen
under
the
bright
electric
lights
he
was
not
handsome
hardly
his
mouth
was
wide
his
nose
irregular
his
hair
a
nondescript
brown
but
the
mouth
had
humor
the
nose
character
and
thank
heaven
there
was
plenty
of
hair
not
that
harmony
saw
all
this
at
once
as
he
tacked
to
and
fro
round
the
tables
with
a
nod
here
and
a
word
there
she
got
a
sort
of
ensemble
effect
a
tall
man
possibly
thirty
broadshouldered
somewhat
stooped
as
tall
men
are
apt
to
be
and
shabby
undeniably
shabby
the
shabbiness
was
a
shock
a
officer
trim
from
the
points
of
his
mustache
to
the
points
of
his
shoes
rose
to
speak
to
him
the
shabbiness
was
accentuated
by
the
contrast
possibly
the
revelation
was
an
easement
to
the
girl
nervousness
this
smiling
and
unpressed
individual
blithely
waving
aloft
the
paris
edition
of
the
herald
and
equally
blithely
ignoring
the
maledictions
of
the
student
from
whom
he
had
taken
it
even
scatchy
could
not
have
called
him
a
vulture
or
threatened
him
with
the
police
he
placed
the
paper
before
her
and
sat
down
at
her
side
not
to
interfere
with
her
outlook
over
the
room
warmer
he
asked
very
coffee
is
coming
and
cinnamon
cakes
with
plenty
of
sugar
they
know
me
here
and
they
know
where
i
live
they
save
the
sugariest
cakes
for
me
do
let
me
bother
you
go
on
and
read
see
which
of
the
smart
set
is
getting
a
divorce
or
is
it
always
the
same
one
and
who
president
back
i
rather
look
round
it
curious
is
it
curious
it
heavenly
it
the
one
thing
i
am
going
to
take
back
to
america
with
me
one
one
dozen
military
men
for
local
color
one
dozen
students
ditto
and
one
proprietor
wife
to
sit
in
the
cage
and
shortchange
the
unsuspecting
i
grow
but
what
about
the
medical
practice
he
leaned
over
toward
her
his
eyes
fulfilled
the
humorous
promise
of
his
mouth
why
it
will
work
out
perfectly
he
said
whimsically
the
great
american
public
will
eat
cinnamon
cakes
and
drink
coffee
until
the
feeble
american
nervous
system
will
be
shattered
i
shall
have
an
office
across
the
street
after
that
having
seen
how
tired
she
looked
he
forbade
conversation
until
she
had
had
her
coffee
she
ate
the
cakes
too
and
he
watched
her
with
comfortable
satisfaction
nod
your
head
but
do
speak
he
said
remember
i
am
prescribing
and
there
to
be
no
conversation
until
the
coffee
is
down
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
open
the
cheese
but
harmony
did
not
wish
the
cheese
and
so
signified
something
inherently
delicate
in
the
unknown
kept
him
from
more
than
an
occasional
swift
glance
at
her
he
read
aloud
as
she
ate
bits
of
news
from
the
paper
pausing
to
sip
his
own
coffee
and
to
cast
an
eye
over
the
crowded
room
here
and
there
an
officer
gazing
with
too
open
admiration
on
harmony
lovely
face
found
himself
fixed
by
a
pair
of
eyes
that
were
anything
but
humorous
at
that
instant
and
thought
best
to
shift
his
gaze
the
coffee
finished
the
girl
began
to
gather
up
her
wraps
but
the
unknown
protested
the
function
of
a
he
explained
gravely
is
twofold
coffee
is
only
the
first
half
the
second
half
is
i
converse
very
so
do
i
suppose
we
talk
about
ourselves
we
are
sure
to
do
that
well
shall
i
commence
harmony
was
in
no
mood
to
protest
having
swallowed
coffee
why
choke
over
conversation
besides
she
was
very
comfortable
it
was
warm
there
with
the
heater
at
her
back
better
than
the
little
room
with
the
sagging
bed
and
the
doors
covered
with
wall
paper
her
feet
had
stopped
aching
too
she
could
have
sat
there
for
hours
and
why
evade
it
she
was
interested
this
whimsical
and
respectful
young
man
with
his
absurd
talk
and
his
shabby
clothes
had
roused
her
curiosity
please
she
assented
then
first
of
all
my
name
i
getting
that
over
early
because
it
is
much
as
names
go
peter
byrne
it
is
do
certainly
i
not
i
have
another
name
put
in
by
my
irish
father
to
conciliate
a
german
uncle
of
my
mother
augustus
it
rather
a
mess
what
shall
i
put
on
my
professional
brassplate
if
i
put
augustus
byrne
nobody
fooled
they
know
my
wretched
first
name
is
or
i
rather
like
patrick
if
i
thought
it
might
pass
as
patrick
patrick
has
possibilities
the
diminutive
is
pat
and
that
not
bad
but
peter
do
you
know
harmony
confessed
half
shyly
i
like
peter
as
a
peter
it
shall
be
then
i
go
down
to
posterity
and
fame
as
peter
byrne
the
rest
does
amount
to
much
but
i
want
you
to
know
it
since
you
have
been
good
enough
to
accept
me
on
faith
i
here
alone
from
a
little
town
in
eastern
ohio
worked
my
way
through
a
coeducational
college
in
the
west
and
escaped
unmarried
did
two
years
in
a
drygoods
store
until
by
saving
and
working
in
my
vacations
i
got
through
medical
college
and
tried
general
practice
did
like
it
always
wanted
to
do
surgery
a
little
legacy
from
the
german
uncle
trying
to
atone
for
the
gave
me
enough
money
to
come
here
i
got
a
chance
with
the
days
surgeons
you
know
when
i
go
back
if
i
can
hang
on
long
enough
that
all
here
a
traveler
check
with
my
name
on
it
to
vouch
for
the
truth
of
this
thrilling
narrative
gaze
on
it
with
awe
there
are
only
a
few
of
them
left
harmony
was
as
delicately
strung
as
vibratingly
responsive
as
the
strings
of
her
own
violin
and
under
the
even
lightness
of
his
tone
she
felt
many
things
that
met
a
response
in
her
loneliness
and
struggle
and
the
anxiety
about
money
grim
determination
hope
and
fear
and
even
occasional
despair
he
was
still
young
but
there
were
lines
in
his
face
and
a
hint
of
gray
in
his
hair
even
had
he
been
less
frank
she
would
have
known
soon
enough
the
dingy
little
pension
the
shabby
clothes
she
held
out
her
hand
thank
you
for
telling
me
she
said
simply
i
think
i
understand
very
well
because
it
music
with
me
violin
and
my
friends
have
gone
so
i
am
alone
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
out
over
the
crowd
without
seeing
it
it
curious
is
it
he
said
here
we
are
you
and
i
meeting
in
the
center
of
europe
both
lonely
as
the
mischief
both
working
our
heads
off
for
an
idea
that
may
never
pan
out
why
are
you
at
home
eating
a
civilized
beefsteak
and
running
upstairs
to
get
ready
for
a
nice
young
man
to
bring
you
a
box
of
chocolates
why
am
i
not
measuring
out
calico
in
shipley
west
instead
we
are
going
to
frau
schwarz
to
listen
to
cold
ham
and
scorched
compote
eaten
in
six
different
harmony
made
no
immediate
reply
he
seemed
to
expect
none
she
was
drawing
on
her
gloves
her
eyes
like
his
roving
over
the
crowd
far
back
among
the
tables
a
young
man
rose
and
yawned
then
seeing
byrne
he
waved
a
greeting
to
him
byrne
eyes
from
being
introspective
became
watchful
the
young
man
was
handsome
in
a
florid
way
with
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
unlike
byrne
he
was
foppishly
neat
he
was
not
alone
a
slim
little
austrian
girl
exceedingly
chic
rose
when
he
did
and
threw
away
the
end
of
a
cigarette
why
do
we
go
so
soon
she
demanded
fretfully
in
german
it
is
early
he
replied
in
english
it
was
a
curious
way
they
had
and
eminently
satisfactory
each
understanding
better
than
he
spoke
the
language
because
my
beloved
he
said
lightly
you
are
smoking
a
great
many
poisonous
and
highly
expensive
cigarettes
also
i
wish
to
speak
to
the
girl
followed
his
eyes
and
stiffened
jealously
who
is
that
with
peter
we
are
going
over
to
find
out
little
one
old
peter
with
a
woman
at
last
the
little
austrian
walked
delicately
swaying
her
slim
body
with
a
slow
and
sensuous
grace
she
touched
an
officer
as
she
passed
him
and
paused
to
apologize
to
the
officer
delight
and
her
escort
irritation
and
peter
byrne
watched
and
waited
a
line
of
annoyance
between
his
brows
the
girl
was
ahead
that
complicated
things
when
she
was
within
a
dozen
feet
of
the
table
he
rose
hastily
with
a
word
of
apology
and
met
the
couple
it
was
adroitly
done
he
had
taken
the
little
austrian
arm
and
led
her
by
the
table
while
he
was
still
greeting
her
he
held
her
in
conversation
in
his
absurd
german
until
they
had
reached
the
swinging
doors
while
her
companion
followed
helplessly
and
he
bowed
her
out
protesting
his
undying
admiration
for
her
eyes
while
the
florid
youth
alternately
raged
behind
him
and
stared
back
at
harmony
interested
and
unconscious
behind
her
table
the
little
austrian
was
on
the
pavement
when
byrne
turned
unsmiling
to
the
other
man
that
wo
do
you
know
stewart
he
said
grave
but
not
unfriendly
the
kid
would
bite
we
not
argue
about
after
a
second
awkward
pause
stewart
smiled
certainly
not
he
agreed
cheerfully
that
is
up
to
you
of
course
i
did
know
we
looking
for
you
a
sudden
repulsion
for
the
evening
engagement
rose
in
byrne
but
the
situation
following
his
ungraciousness
was
delicate
i
be
round
he
said
i
have
a
lecture
and
i
may
be
late
but
the
kid
was
not
stupid
she
moved
off
into
the
night
chin
in
air
angrily
flushed
you
saw
she
choked
when
stewart
had
overtaken
her
and
slipped
a
hand
through
her
arm
he
protects
her
from
me
it
is
because
of
you
before
i
knew
you
before
you
knew
me
little
one
he
said
cheerfully
you
were
exactly
what
you
are
she
paused
on
the
curb
and
raised
her
voice
so
and
what
is
that
beautiful
as
the
stars
only
not
so
in
their
curious
talk
there
was
little
room
for
subtlety
the
beautiful
calmed
her
but
the
second
part
of
the
sentence
roused
her
suspicion
remote
what
is
that
i
was
thinking
of
the
name
was
a
signal
for
war
stewart
repented
but
too
late
in
the
cold
evening
air
to
the
amusement
of
a
passing
detail
of
soldiers
trundling
a
breadwagon
by
a
rope
stewart
stood
on
the
pavement
and
dodged
verbal
brickbats
of
viennese
idioms
and
german
epithets
he
drew
his
chin
into
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
and
waited
an
absurdly
patient
figure
until
the
hail
of
consonants
had
subsided
into
a
rain
of
tears
then
he
took
the
girl
elbow
again
and
led
her
childishly
weeping
into
a
narrow
side
street
beyond
the
prying
ears
and
eyes
of
the
alserstrasse
byrne
went
back
to
harmony
the
incident
of
stewart
and
the
girl
was
closed
and
he
dismissed
it
instantly
that
situation
was
not
his
or
of
his
making
but
here
in
the
lovely
alluring
rather
puzzled
at
this
moment
was
also
a
situation
for
there
was
a
situation
he
had
suspected
it
that
morning
listening
to
the
narrative
of
rosa
account
of
the
disrupted
colony
across
in
the
old
lodge
he
had
been
certain
of
it
that
evening
finding
harmony
in
the
dark
entrance
to
his
own
rather
sordid
pension
now
in
the
bright
light
of
the
surmising
her
poverty
seeing
her
beauty
the
emotional
coming
and
going
of
her
color
her
frank
loneliness
and
god
save
the
mark
her
trust
in
him
he
accepted
the
situation
and
adopted
it
his
responsibility
if
you
please
he
straightened
under
it
he
knew
the
old
city
fairly
well
enough
to
love
it
and
to
loathe
it
in
one
breath
he
had
seen
its
tragedies
and
passed
them
by
or
had
in
his
haphazard
way
thrown
a
greeting
to
them
or
even
a
glass
of
native
wine
and
he
knew
the
musical
temperament
the
all
or
nothing
of
its
insistent
demands
its
heights
that
are
higher
than
others
its
wretchednesses
that
are
hell
once
in
the
hofstadt
theater
where
he
had
bought
standing
room
he
had
seen
a
girl
he
had
known
in
berlin
where
he
was
taking
clinics
and
where
she
was
cooking
her
own
meals
she
had
been
studying
singing
in
the
hofstadt
theater
she
had
worn
a
sable
coat
and
had
avoided
his
eyes
perhaps
the
old
had
seen
nothing
more
absurd
in
its
years
of
coffee
and
billiards
and
munchener
beer
than
peter
new
resolution
that
night
this
poverty
adopting
poverty
this
youth
adopting
youth
with
the
altruistic
purpose
of
saving
it
from
itself
and
this
mind
you
before
peter
byrne
had
heard
harmony
story
or
knew
her
name
rosa
having
called
her
the
beautiful
one
in
her
narrative
and
the
being
literal
in
his
repetition
back
to
the
beautiful
one
went
peter
byrne
and
true
to
his
new
part
of
protector
and
guardian
squared
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
look
much
older
than
he
really
was
and
responsible
the
result
was
a
grimness
that
alarmed
harmony
back
to
the
forgotten
proprieties
i
think
i
must
go
she
said
hurriedly
after
a
glance
at
his
determinedly
altruistic
profile
i
must
finish
packing
my
things
the
portier
has
promised
go
why
you
have
even
told
me
your
name
frau
schwarz
will
present
you
primly
and
rising
peter
byrne
rose
too
i
am
going
back
with
you
you
should
not
go
through
that
lonely
yard
alone
after
yard
how
do
you
know
that
byrne
was
picking
up
the
cheese
which
he
had
thoughtlessly
set
on
the
heater
and
which
proved
to
be
in
an
alarming
state
of
dissolution
it
took
a
moment
to
rewrap
and
incidentally
furnished
an
inspiration
he
indicated
it
airily
saw
you
this
morning
coming
out
delicatessen
shop
across
the
street
he
said
glibly
and
then
in
an
outburst
of
honesty
which
the
eyes
seemed
somehow
to
compel
that
true
but
it
not
all
the
truth
i
was
on
the
bus
last
night
and
when
you
got
off
alone
i
i
saw
you
were
an
american
and
that
not
a
good
neighborhood
i
took
the
liberty
of
following
you
to
your
gate
he
need
not
have
been
alarmed
harmony
was
only
grateful
and
said
so
and
in
her
gratitude
she
made
no
objection
to
his
suggestion
that
he
see
her
safely
to
the
old
lodge
and
help
her
carry
her
and
her
violin
to
the
pension
he
paid
the
trifling
score
and
followed
by
many
eyes
in
the
room
they
went
out
into
the
crisp
night
together
at
the
lodge
the
doors
stood
wide
and
a
vigorous
sound
of
scrubbing
showed
that
the
portier
wife
was
preparing
for
the
inspection
of
possible
new
tenants
she
was
cleaning
down
the
stairs
by
the
light
of
a
candle
and
the
steam
of
the
hot
water
on
the
cold
marble
invested
her
like
an
aura
she
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
and
then
went
cumbrously
down
the
stairs
to
where
a
fork
in
one
hand
and
a
pipe
in
the
other
the
portier
was
frying
chops
for
the
evening
meal
what
have
i
said
she
demanded
from
the
doorway
your
angel
is
so
she
with
whom
you
sing
old
cracked
voice
whose
money
you
refuse
because
she
reminds
you
of
your
opera
singer
she
is
again
here
and
with
a
man
it
is
the
way
of
the
young
and
beautiful
there
is
always
a
man
said
the
portier
turning
a
chop
his
wife
wiped
her
steaming
hands
on
her
apron
and
turned
away
exasperated
it
is
the
same
man
whom
i
last
night
saw
at
the
gate
she
threw
back
over
her
shoulder
i
knew
it
from
the
first
but
you
great
booby
can
see
nothing
but
red
lips
bah
upstairs
in
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
lighted
by
one
candle
and
freezing
cold
in
a
stiff
chair
under
the
great
chandelier
peter
byrne
sat
and
waited
and
blew
on
his
fingers
down
below
in
the
street
of
seven
stars
the
arc
lights
swung
in
the
wind
chapter
iv
the
supper
that
evening
was
even
unusually
bad
frau
schwarz
much
crimped
and
clad
in
frayed
black
satin
presided
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
there
were
few
almost
no
americans
the
americans
flocking
to
good
food
at
reckless
prices
in
more
fashionable
pensions
to
the
frau
gallitzenstein
for
instance
in
the
kochgasse
where
there
was
to
be
had
real
beefsteak
where
turkeys
were
served
at
thanksgiving
and
christmas
and
where
were
one
so
minded
one
might
revel
in
whipped
cream
the
pension
schwarz
however
was
not
without
adornment
in
the
center
of
the
table
was
a
large
bunch
of
red
cotton
roses
with
wire
stems
and
green
paper
leaves
and
over
the
with
its
luxury
of
compote
in
tall
glass
dishes
and
its
wealth
of
small
hard
cakes
there
hung
a
framed
motto
which
said
nicht
rauchen
no
smoking
and
which
looked
suspiciously
as
if
it
had
once
adorned
a
compartment
of
a
railroad
train
peter
byrne
was
early
in
the
he
had
made
for
him
a
careful
toilet
which
consisted
of
a
shave
and
clean
linen
but
he
had
gone
further
he
had
discovered
for
the
first
time
in
the
three
months
of
its
defection
a
button
missing
from
his
coat
and
had
set
about
to
replace
it
he
had
cut
a
button
from
another
coat
by
the
easy
method
of
amputating
it
with
a
surgical
bistoury
and
had
sewed
it
in
its
new
position
with
a
curved
surgical
needle
and
a
few
inches
of
sterilized
catgut
the
operation
was
slow
and
painful
and
accomplished
only
with
the
aid
of
two
cigarettes
and
an
artery
clip
when
it
was
over
he
tied
the
ends
in
a
surgeon
knot
underneath
and
stood
back
to
consider
the
result
it
seemed
neat
enough
but
conspicuous
after
a
moment
or
two
of
troubled
thought
he
blacked
the
white
catgut
with
a
dot
of
ink
and
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
peter
byrne
was
entirely
untroubled
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
course
he
had
laid
out
for
himself
he
followed
no
consecutive
line
of
thought
as
he
dressed
when
he
was
not
smoking
he
was
whistling
and
when
he
was
doing
neither
and
the
needle
proved
refractory
in
his
cold
fingers
he
was
swearing
to
himself
for
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
the
materials
for
a
fire
were
there
and
a
white
tile
stove
as
cozy
as
an
obelisk
in
a
cemetery
stood
in
the
corner
but
fires
are
expensive
and
hardly
necessary
when
one
sleeps
with
all
one
windows
open
one
window
to
be
exact
the
room
being
very
small
and
spends
most
of
the
day
in
a
warm
and
comfortable
shambles
called
a
hospital
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
not
thinking
of
harmony
at
all
except
subconsciously
as
instance
the
button
he
was
going
over
step
by
step
the
technic
of
an
operation
he
had
seen
that
afternoon
weighing
considering
even
criticizing
his
conclusion
reached
as
he
brushed
back
his
hair
and
put
away
his
sewing
implements
was
somewhat
to
the
effect
that
he
could
have
done
a
better
piece
of
work
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
wealth
of
material
to
work
on
he
pack
up
and
go
home
which
brought
him
back
to
harmony
and
his
new
responsibility
he
took
off
the
necktie
he
had
absently
put
on
and
hunted
out
a
better
one
he
was
late
at
supper
an
offense
that
brought
a
scowl
from
the
head
of
the
table
a
scowl
that
he
met
with
a
cheerful
smile
harmony
was
already
in
her
place
seated
between
a
little
bulgarian
and
a
jewish
student
from
galicia
she
was
almost
immediately
struggling
in
a
sea
of
language
into
which
she
struck
out
now
and
then
tentatively
only
to
be
again
submerged
byrne
had
bowed
to
her
conventionally
even
coldly
aware
of
the
sharp
eyes
and
tongues
round
the
table
but
harmony
did
not
understand
she
had
expected
moral
support
from
his
presence
and
failing
that
she
sank
back
into
the
loneliness
and
depression
of
the
day
her
bright
color
faded
her
eyes
looked
tragic
and
rather
aloof
she
ate
almost
nothing
and
left
the
table
before
the
others
had
finished
what
curious
little
dramas
of
the
table
are
played
under
unseeing
eyes
what
small
tragedies
begin
with
the
soup
and
end
with
dessert
what
heartaches
with
a
salad
small
tragedies
of
averted
eyes
looking
away
from
appealing
ones
lips
that
tremble
with
wretchedness
nibbling
daintily
at
a
morsel
smiles
that
sear
foolish
bits
of
talk
that
mean
nothing
except
to
one
and
to
that
one
everything
harmony
freezing
at
peter
formal
bow
and
gazing
obstinately
ahead
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
or
no
nearer
peter
than
the
roses
and
peter
showering
the
little
bulgarian
next
to
her
with
detestable
german
in
the
hope
of
a
glance
and
over
all
the
odor
of
cabbage
salad
and
the
nicht
rauchen
sign
and
an
acrimonious
discussion
on
eugenics
between
an
american
woman
doctor
named
gates
and
a
german
matron
who
had
had
fifteen
children
and
who
reduced
every
general
statement
to
a
personal
insult
peter
followed
harmony
as
soon
as
he
dared
her
door
was
closed
and
she
was
playing
very
softly
so
as
to
disturb
no
one
defiantly
too
had
he
only
known
it
her
small
chin
up
and
her
color
high
again
playing
the
humoresque
of
all
things
in
the
hope
of
course
that
he
would
hear
it
and
guess
from
her
choice
the
wild
merriment
of
her
mood
peter
rapped
once
or
twice
but
obtained
no
answer
save
that
the
humoresque
rose
a
bit
higher
and
gates
coming
along
the
hall
just
then
he
was
forced
to
light
a
cigarette
to
cover
his
pausing
gates
however
was
not
suspicious
she
was
a
smallish
woman
of
forty
or
thereabout
with
keen
eyes
behind
glasses
and
a
masculine
disregard
of
clothes
and
she
paused
by
byrne
to
let
him
help
her
into
her
ulster
new
girl
eh
she
said
with
a
birdlike
nod
toward
the
door
very
gay
is
she
to
have
just
finished
a
supper
like
that
honestly
peter
what
are
we
going
to
do
growl
and
stay
on
as
we
have
for
six
months
there
is
better
food
but
not
for
our
gates
sighed
and
picking
a
soft
felt
hat
from
the
table
put
it
on
with
a
single
jerk
down
over
her
hair
oh
darn
money
anyhow
she
said
come
and
walk
to
the
corner
with
me
i
have
a
peter
promised
to
follow
in
a
moment
and
hurried
back
to
his
room
there
on
a
page
from
one
of
his
lecture
notebooks
he
wrote
are
you
ill
or
have
i
done
anything
p
this
with
great
care
he
was
pushing
under
harmony
door
when
the
little
bulgarian
came
along
and
stopped
smiling
he
said
nothing
nor
did
peter
who
rose
and
dusted
his
knees
the
little
bulgarian
spoke
no
english
and
little
german
between
them
was
the
wall
of
language
but
higher
than
this
barrier
was
the
understanding
of
their
common
sex
he
held
out
his
hand
still
smiling
and
peter
grinning
sheepishly
took
it
then
he
followed
the
woman
doctor
down
the
stairs
to
say
that
peter
byrne
was
already
in
love
with
harmony
would
be
absurd
she
attracted
him
as
any
beautiful
and
helpless
girl
attracts
an
unattracted
man
he
was
much
more
concerned
now
that
he
feared
he
had
offended
her
than
he
would
have
been
without
this
fillip
to
his
interest
but
even
his
concern
did
not
prevent
his
taking
copious
and
intelligent
notes
at
his
lecture
that
night
or
interfere
with
his
enjoyment
of
the
stein
of
beer
with
which
after
it
was
over
he
washed
down
its
involved
german
the
engagement
at
stewart
irked
him
somewhat
he
did
not
approve
of
stewart
exactly
not
from
any
dislike
of
the
man
but
from
a
lack
of
fineness
in
the
man
himself
an
intangible
thing
that
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
that
unfashionable
essence
the
soul
as
against
the
clay
of
the
thing
contained
by
an
inverse
metonymy
for
the
container
boyer
a
nerve
man
from
texas
met
him
on
the
street
and
they
walked
to
stewart
apartment
together
the
frosty
air
and
the
rapid
exercise
combined
to
drive
away
byrne
irritation
that
and
the
recollection
that
it
was
saturday
night
and
that
there
would
be
no
clinics
no
lectures
no
operations
that
the
great
shambles
would
be
closed
down
and
that
priests
would
read
mass
to
convalescents
in
the
chapels
he
was
whistling
as
he
walked
along
boyer
a
much
older
man
whose
wife
had
come
over
with
him
stopped
under
a
street
light
to
consult
his
watch
almost
ten
he
said
i
hope
you
do
mind
byrne
but
i
told
jennie
i
was
going
to
your
pension
she
detests
oh
that
all
right
she
knows
you
playing
poker
yes
she
does
object
to
poker
it
the
other
you
ca
make
a
good
woman
understand
that
sort
of
thank
god
for
that
after
a
moment
of
silence
byrne
took
up
his
whistling
again
it
was
the
stewart
apartment
was
on
the
third
floor
admission
at
that
hour
was
to
be
gained
only
by
ringing
and
boyer
touched
the
bell
the
lights
were
still
on
however
in
the
hallways
revealing
not
overclean
stairs
and
for
a
wonder
an
electric
elevator
this
however
a
card
announced
as
out
of
order
boyer
stopped
and
examined
the
card
grimly
of
order
he
observed
out
of
order
since
last
spring
judging
by
that
card
vorwarts
they
climbed
easily
deliberately
at
home
in
god
country
boyer
played
golf
as
became
the
leading
specialist
of
his
county
byrne
with
a
like
the
rod
of
a
locomotive
had
been
obliged
to
forswear
the
more
expensive
game
for
tennis
with
a
resulting
muscular
development
that
his
slight
stoop
belied
he
was
as
hard
as
nails
without
an
ounce
of
fat
and
he
climbed
the
long
steep
flights
with
an
elasticity
that
left
even
boyer
a
step
or
so
behind
stewart
opened
the
door
himself
long
german
pipe
in
hand
his
coat
replaced
by
a
worn
the
little
apartment
was
thick
with
smoke
and
from
a
room
on
the
right
came
the
click
of
chips
and
the
sound
of
beer
mugs
on
wood
marie
restored
to
good
humor
came
out
to
greet
them
and
both
men
bowed
ceremoniously
over
her
hand
clicking
their
heels
together
and
bowing
from
the
waist
byrne
sniffed
what
do
i
smell
marie
he
demanded
surely
not
sausages
marie
dimpled
it
was
an
old
joke
to
be
greeted
as
one
greets
an
old
friend
it
was
always
sausages
sausages
of
a
truth
fat
ones
but
surely
not
with
mustard
ach
ja
englisch
stewart
and
boyer
had
gone
on
ahead
marie
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
byrne
arm
i
was
very
angry
with
you
with
me
like
the
others
who
occasionally
gathered
in
stewart
unconventional
menage
byrne
had
adopted
stewart
custom
of
addressing
marie
in
english
while
she
replied
in
her
own
tongue
ja
i
wished
but
to
see
nearer
the
american
fraulein
hat
and
you
she
is
rich
so
i
really
do
know
i
think
and
good
yes
of
marie
was
small
she
stood
her
head
back
her
eyes
narrowed
looking
up
at
byrne
there
was
nothing
evil
in
her
face
it
was
not
even
hard
rather
there
was
a
sort
of
weariness
as
of
age
and
experience
she
had
put
on
a
white
dress
cut
out
at
the
neck
and
above
her
collarbones
were
small
cuplike
hollows
she
was
very
thin
i
was
sad
she
said
plaintively
i
wished
to
jump
out
the
byrne
was
startled
but
the
girl
was
smiling
at
the
recollection
and
i
made
you
feel
like
that
not
you
the
other
fraulein
i
was
dirt
to
her
i
she
stopped
tragically
then
sniffled
the
sausages
she
cried
and
gathering
up
her
skirts
ran
toward
the
kitchen
byrne
went
on
into
the
stewart
was
a
single
man
spending
two
years
in
work
in
germany
and
austria
not
so
much
because
the
germans
and
austrians
could
teach
what
could
not
be
taught
at
home
but
because
of
the
wealth
of
clinical
material
the
great
european
hospitals
filled
to
overflowing
offered
unlimited
choice
of
cases
the
contempt
for
human
life
of
overpopulated
cities
coupled
with
the
extreme
poverty
and
helplessness
of
the
masses
combined
to
form
that
tragic
part
of
the
world
which
dies
that
others
may
live
stewart
like
byrne
was
doing
surgery
and
the
very
lack
of
fineness
which
byrne
felt
in
the
man
promised
something
in
his
work
a
sort
of
ruthlessness
a
singleness
of
purpose
good
or
bad
an
overwhelming
egotism
that
in
his
profession
might
only
be
a
necessary
his
singleness
of
purpose
had
at
the
beginning
of
his
residence
in
vienna
devoted
itself
to
making
him
comfortable
with
the
narrow
means
at
his
control
he
had
the
choice
of
two
alternatives
to
live
as
byrne
was
living
in
a
pension
stewing
in
summer
freezing
in
winter
starving
always
or
the
alternative
he
had
chosen
the
stewart
apartment
had
only
three
rooms
but
it
possessed
that
luxury
of
luxuries
a
bath
it
was
not
a
bath
in
the
usual
sense
of
water
on
tap
and
shining
nickel
plate
but
a
bath
for
all
that
where
with
premeditation
and
forethought
one
might
bathe
the
room
had
once
been
a
fuel
and
store
room
but
now
boasted
a
tin
tub
and
a
stove
with
a
reservoir
on
top
where
water
might
be
heated
to
the
boiling
point
at
the
same
time
bringing
up
the
atmosphere
to
a
point
where
the
tin
tub
sizzled
if
one
touched
it
behind
the
bathroom
a
tiny
kitchen
with
a
brick
stove
next
a
bedroom
the
whole
incredibly
neat
along
one
side
of
the
wall
a
clothespress
which
the
combined
wardrobes
of
two
did
not
fill
and
beyond
that
again
opening
through
an
arch
with
a
dingy
chenille
curtain
the
now
in
chaotic
disorder
byrne
went
directly
to
the
there
were
four
men
already
there
stewart
and
boyer
a
pathology
man
named
wallace
hunter
doing
research
work
at
the
general
hospital
and
a
young
piano
student
from
tennessee
named
maclean
the
cards
had
been
already
dealt
and
byrne
stood
by
waiting
for
the
hand
to
be
played
the
game
was
a
small
one
as
befitted
the
means
of
the
majority
it
was
a
regular
saturday
night
affair
as
much
a
custom
as
the
beer
that
sat
in
steins
on
the
floor
beside
each
man
or
as
marie
boiled
wiener
sausages
the
blue
chips
represented
a
krone
the
white
ones
five
hellers
maclean
who
was
hardly
more
than
a
boy
was
winning
drawing
in
chips
with
quick
gestures
of
his
long
pianist
fingers
byrne
sat
down
and
picked
up
his
cards
stewart
was
staying
out
and
so
after
a
glance
did
he
the
other
three
drew
cards
and
fell
to
betting
stewart
leaned
back
and
filled
his
long
pipe
and
after
a
hesitation
byrne
turned
to
him
i
do
know
just
what
to
say
stewart
he
began
in
an
undertone
sorry
i
did
want
to
hurt
marie
but
oh
that
all
stewart
drew
at
his
pipe
and
bent
forward
to
watch
the
game
with
an
air
of
ending
the
discussion
not
at
all
i
did
hurt
her
and
i
want
to
explain
marie
has
been
kind
to
me
and
i
like
her
you
know
do
be
an
ass
stewart
turned
on
him
sharply
marie
is
a
little
fool
that
all
i
did
know
it
was
an
american
byrne
played
in
bad
luck
his
mind
was
not
on
the
cards
he
stayed
out
of
the
last
hand
and
with
a
cigarette
wandered
about
the
room
he
glanced
into
the
tidy
bedroom
and
beyond
to
where
marie
hovered
over
the
stove
she
turned
and
saw
him
come
she
called
watch
the
supper
for
me
while
i
go
down
for
more
but
no
he
replied
imitating
her
tone
watch
the
supper
for
me
while
i
go
down
for
more
i
love
thee
she
called
merrily
tell
the
herr
doktor
i
love
thee
and
here
is
the
when
he
returned
the
supper
was
already
laid
in
the
little
kitchen
the
cards
were
put
away
and
young
maclean
and
wallace
hunter
were
replacing
the
cover
and
the
lamp
on
the
stewart
was
orating
from
a
pinnacle
of
proprietorship
exactly
he
was
saying
in
reply
to
something
gone
before
i
used
to
come
here
saturday
nights
used
to
come
early
and
take
a
bath
worthington
had
rented
it
furnished
for
a
song
used
to
sit
in
a
corner
and
envy
worthington
his
bathtub
and
that
lamp
there
and
decent
food
and
a
bed
that
did
suffer
from
necrosis
in
the
center
then
when
he
was
called
home
i
took
girl
and
all
was
it
girl
and
all
old
worth
said
she
was
straight
and
by
jove
she
is
he
came
back
last
fall
on
his
wedding
trip
he
married
a
wealthy
girl
and
came
to
see
us
i
was
out
but
marie
was
here
there
was
the
deuce
to
he
lowered
his
voice
the
men
had
gathered
about
him
in
a
group
jealous
eh
from
hunter
jealous
no
he
tried
to
kiss
her
and
she
hit
him
said
he
respect
her
it
a
curious
code
of
honor
said
boyer
thoughtfully
and
indeed
to
none
but
stewart
did
it
seem
amusing
this
little
girl
of
the
streets
driven
by
god
knows
what
necessity
to
make
her
own
code
and
having
made
it
living
up
to
it
with
every
fiber
of
her
bitte
zum
speisen
called
marie
gayly
from
her
brick
stove
and
the
men
trooped
out
to
the
kitchen
the
supper
was
spread
on
the
table
with
the
pitcher
of
beer
in
the
center
there
were
swiss
cheese
and
cold
ham
and
rolls
and
above
all
sausages
and
mustard
peter
drank
a
great
deal
of
beer
as
did
the
others
and
sang
german
songs
with
a
frightful
accent
and
much
vigor
and
sentiment
as
also
did
the
others
then
he
went
back
to
the
cold
room
in
the
pension
schwarz
and
told
himself
he
was
a
fool
to
live
alone
when
one
could
live
like
a
prince
for
the
same
sum
properly
laid
out
he
dropped
into
the
hollow
center
of
his
bed
where
his
big
figure
fitted
as
comfortably
as
though
it
lay
in
a
washtub
and
before
his
eyes
there
came
a
vision
of
stewart
flat
and
the
slippers
by
the
fire
which
was
eminently
human
however
a
moment
later
he
yawned
and
said
aloud
with
considerable
vigor
that
he
be
damned
if
he
would
which
was
eminently
peter
byrne
almost
immediately
with
the
bed
coverings
augmented
by
his
overcoat
drawn
snug
to
his
chin
and
the
better
necktie
swinging
from
the
gasjet
in
the
air
from
the
opened
window
peter
was
asleep
for
four
hours
he
had
entirely
forgotten
harmony
chapter
v
the
peace
of
a
gray
sunday
morning
hung
like
a
cloud
over
the
little
pension
schwarz
in
the
kitchen
the
elderly
maid
with
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
stiffened
fingers
made
the
fire
while
in
the
the
little
chambermaid
cut
butter
and
divided
it
sparingly
among
a
dozen
breakfast
trays
on
each
tray
two
hard
rolls
a
butter
pat
a
plate
a
cup
on
two
trays
olga
with
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
placed
two
butter
pats
the
mistress
yet
slept
but
in
the
kitchen
katrina
had
a
keen
eye
for
butter
and
a
hard
heart
katrina
came
to
the
door
the
hot
water
is
ready
she
announced
and
the
coffee
also
hast
thou
been
to
mass
that
is
a
this
quite
on
general
principle
it
being
one
of
the
cook
small
tyrannies
to
exact
religious
observance
from
her
underling
and
one
of
olga
sunday
morning
indulgences
to
oversleep
and
avoid
the
mass
olga
took
the
accusation
meekly
and
without
reply
being
occupied
at
that
moment
in
standing
between
katrina
and
the
extra
pats
of
butter
for
the
lie
said
katrina
calmly
thou
shalt
have
no
butter
this
morning
there
the
herr
doktor
rings
for
water
get
it
wicked
one
katrina
turned
slowly
in
the
doorway
the
new
fraulein
is
american
katrina
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
i
shall
put
more
water
to
heat
she
said
resignedly
the
americans
use
much
water
god
knows
it
can
not
be
healthy
olga
filled
her
pitcher
from
the
great
copper
kettle
and
stood
with
it
poised
in
her
thin
young
arms
the
new
fraulein
is
very
beautiful
she
continued
aloud
thinkest
thou
it
is
the
hot
water
is
an
egg
more
beautiful
for
being
boiled
demanded
katrina
go
and
be
less
foolish
see
it
is
not
the
herr
doktor
who
rings
but
the
new
olga
carried
her
pitcher
to
harmony
door
and
being
bidden
entered
the
room
was
frigid
and
harmony
at
the
window
in
her
nightgown
was
closing
the
outer
casement
the
inner
still
swung
open
olga
having
put
down
her
pitcher
shivered
surely
the
fraulein
has
not
slept
with
open
windows
always
with
open
harmony
having
secured
the
inner
casement
was
wrapping
herself
in
the
blue
silk
kimono
with
the
faded
butterflies
merely
to
look
at
it
made
olga
shiver
afresh
she
shook
her
head
but
the
air
of
the
night
she
said
it
is
full
of
mists
and
illnesses
will
you
have
breakfast
now
in
ten
minutes
after
i
have
olga
having
put
a
match
to
the
stove
went
back
to
the
kitchen
shaking
her
head
they
are
strange
the
americans
she
said
to
latrine
and
if
to
be
lovely
one
must
bathe
daily
and
sleep
with
open
windows
harmony
had
slept
soundly
after
all
her
pique
at
byrne
had
passed
with
the
reading
of
his
note
and
the
sensation
of
his
protection
and
nearness
had
been
almost
physical
in
the
virginal
little
apartment
in
the
lodge
of
maria
theresa
the
only
masculine
presence
had
been
that
of
the
portier
carrying
up
coals
at
ninety
hellers
a
bucket
or
of
the
accompanist
who
each
alternate
day
had
played
for
the
big
soprano
to
practice
and
they
had
felt
no
deprivation
except
for
those
occasional
times
when
scatchy
developed
a
reckless
wish
to
see
the
interior
of
a
or
one
of
the
little
theaters
that
opened
after
the
opera
but
as
calmly
as
though
she
had
never
argued
alone
with
a
cabman
or
disputed
the
bill
at
the
delicatessen
shop
harmony
had
thrown
herself
on
the
protection
of
this
shabby
big
american
whom
she
had
met
but
once
and
having
done
so
slept
like
a
baby
not
of
course
that
she
realized
her
dependence
she
had
felt
very
old
and
experienced
and
exceedingly
courageous
as
she
put
out
her
light
the
night
before
and
took
a
flying
leap
into
the
bed
she
was
still
old
and
experienced
if
a
trifle
less
courageous
that
sunday
morning
promptly
in
ten
minutes
olga
brought
the
breakfast
two
rolls
two
pats
of
butter
shades
of
the
sleeping
mistress
and
katrina
the
thrifty
and
a
cup
of
coffee
on
the
tray
was
a
bit
of
paper
torn
from
a
notebook
part
of
the
prescription
is
an
occasional
walk
in
good
company
will
you
walk
with
me
this
afternoon
i
would
come
in
person
to
ask
you
but
am
spending
the
morning
in
my
bathrobe
while
my
one
remaining
american
suit
is
being
pressed
p
harmony
got
the
ink
and
her
pen
from
her
trunk
and
wrote
below
you
are
very
kind
to
me
yes
indeed
h
when
frequent
slamming
of
doors
and
steps
along
the
passageway
told
harmony
that
the
pension
was
fully
awake
she
got
out
her
violin
the
idea
of
work
obsessed
her
there
would
be
the
hunt
for
something
to
do
to
supplement
her
resources
this
afternoon
she
had
rashly
promised
to
walk
the
morning
then
must
be
given
up
to
work
but
after
all
she
did
little
for
an
hour
perhaps
she
practiced
the
little
bulgarian
paused
outside
her
door
and
listened
rapt
his
eyes
closed
peter
byrne
listening
while
he
sorted
lecture
memoranda
at
his
little
table
in
bathrobe
and
slippers
absently
filed
the
little
note
with
the
others
where
he
came
across
it
months
later
next
to
a
lecture
on
mcburney
point
and
spent
a
sad
hour
or
so
over
it
over
all
the
sordid
little
pension
with
its
odors
of
food
and
stale
air
its
spotted
napery
and
dusty
artificial
flowers
the
music
hovered
and
made
for
the
time
all
things
lovely
in
her
room
across
from
harmony
anna
gates
was
sewing
or
preparing
to
sew
her
hair
in
a
knob
her
sleeves
rolled
up
the
room
in
violent
disorder
she
was
bending
over
the
bed
cutting
savagely
at
a
roll
of
pink
flannel
because
she
was
working
with
curved
surgeon
scissors
borrowed
from
peter
the
cut
edges
were
strangely
scalloped
her
method
as
well
as
her
tools
was
unique
clearly
she
was
intent
on
a
body
garment
for
now
and
then
she
picked
up
the
flannel
and
held
it
to
her
having
thus
as
one
may
say
got
the
line
of
the
thing
she
proceeded
to
cut
again
jaw
tight
set
small
veins
on
her
forehead
swelling
a
small
replica
of
peter
byrne
sewing
a
button
on
his
coat
after
a
time
it
became
clear
to
her
that
her
method
was
wrong
she
rolled
up
the
flannel
viciously
and
flung
it
into
a
corner
and
proceeded
to
her
sunday
morning
occupation
of
putting
away
the
garments
she
had
worn
during
the
week
a
vast
and
motley
collection
on
the
irritability
of
her
mood
harmony
music
had
a
late
but
certain
effect
she
made
a
toilet
a
trifle
less
casual
than
usual
seeing
that
she
put
on
her
stays
and
rather
sheepishly
picked
up
the
bundle
from
the
corner
she
hunted
about
for
a
thimble
being
certain
she
had
brought
one
from
home
a
year
before
but
failed
to
find
it
and
finally
bundle
under
her
arm
and
smiling
she
knocked
at
harmony
door
would
you
mind
letting
me
sit
with
you
she
asked
i
not
stir
i
want
to
sew
and
my
room
is
such
a
mess
harmony
threw
the
door
wide
you
will
make
me
very
happy
if
only
my
practicing
does
not
disturb
gates
came
in
and
closed
the
door
i
probably
be
the
disturbing
element
she
said
i
a
noisy
harmony
immaculate
room
and
radiant
person
put
her
in
good
humor
immediately
she
borrowed
a
thimble
not
because
she
cared
whether
she
had
one
or
not
but
because
she
knew
a
thimble
was
a
part
of
the
game
and
settled
herself
in
a
corner
her
ragged
pieces
in
her
lap
for
an
hour
she
plodded
along
and
harmony
played
then
the
girl
put
down
her
bow
and
turned
to
the
corner
the
little
doctor
was
jerking
at
a
knot
in
her
thread
it
in
the
most
damnable
knot
she
said
and
harmony
was
suddenly
aware
that
she
was
crying
and
heartily
ashamed
of
it
please
do
pay
any
attention
to
me
she
implored
i
hate
to
sew
that
the
trouble
or
perhaps
it
not
all
the
trouble
i
a
fool
about
perhaps
if
you
hate
to
sew
i
hate
a
good
many
things
my
dear
when
you
play
like
that
i
hate
being
over
here
in
this
place
and
i
hate
fleas
and
german
cooking
and
clinics
and
i
hate
being
forty
years
old
and
as
poor
as
a
and
as
ugly
as
sin
and
i
hate
never
having
had
any
children
harmony
was
very
uncomfortable
and
just
a
little
shocked
but
the
next
moment
gates
had
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
scrap
of
the
flannel
and
was
smiling
up
through
her
glasses
the
plain
truth
really
is
that
i
have
indigestion
i
dare
say
really
weeping
in
anticipation
over
the
sunday
dinner
the
food
bad
and
i
ca
afford
to
live
anywhere
else
i
take
a
room
and
do
my
own
cooking
but
what
time
have
i
she
spread
out
the
pieces
of
flannel
on
her
knee
does
this
look
like
anything
to
you
a
petticoat
is
it
i
did
intend
it
as
a
i
thought
on
account
of
the
scallops
scallops
gates
gazed
at
the
painfully
cut
pink
edges
and
from
them
to
harmony
then
she
laughed
peal
after
peal
of
joyous
mirth
scallops
she
gasped
at
last
oh
my
dear
if
you
seen
me
cutting
and
with
peter
byrne
scissors
now
here
at
last
they
were
on
common
ground
harmony
delicately
flushed
repeated
the
name
clung
to
it
conversationally
using
little
adroitnesses
to
bring
the
talk
back
to
him
all
roads
of
talk
led
to
peter
peter
future
peter
poverty
peter
refusing
to
have
his
hair
cut
peter
encounter
with
a
major
of
the
guards
and
the
duel
peter
almost
fought
it
developed
that
peter
as
the
challenged
had
had
the
choice
of
weapons
and
had
chosen
fists
and
that
the
major
had
been
carried
away
gates
grew
rather
weary
of
peter
at
last
and
fell
back
on
the
pink
flannel
she
confided
to
harmony
that
the
various
pieces
united
were
to
make
a
for
a
little
american
boy
at
the
hospital
although
she
commented
it
looks
more
like
a
chair
harmony
offered
to
help
her
and
got
out
a
that
was
lined
with
a
piece
of
her
mother
wedding
dress
and
as
she
straightened
the
crooked
edges
she
told
the
doctor
about
the
wedding
dress
and
about
the
mother
who
had
called
her
harmony
because
of
the
hope
in
her
heart
and
soon
by
dint
of
skillful
listening
which
is
always
better
than
questioning
the
faded
little
woman
doctor
knew
all
the
story
she
was
rather
aghast
but
suppose
you
can
not
find
anything
to
do
i
must
simply
it
such
a
terrible
city
for
a
girl
i
not
really
alone
i
know
you
an
impoverished
spinster
much
help
i
shall
be
and
there
is
peter
peter
gates
sniffed
peter
is
poorer
than
i
am
if
there
is
any
comparison
in
destitution
harmony
stiffened
a
trifle
of
course
i
do
not
mean
money
she
said
there
are
such
things
as
encouragement
and
and
one
can
not
eat
encouragement
retorted
gates
sagely
and
friendliness
between
you
and
any
man
bah
even
peter
is
only
human
my
i
am
sure
he
is
very
so
he
is
he
is
very
poor
but
you
are
very
attractive
there
i
a
skeptic
about
men
but
you
can
trust
peter
only
do
fall
in
love
with
him
it
will
be
years
before
he
can
marry
and
do
let
him
fall
in
love
with
you
he
probably
whereupon
gates
taking
herself
and
her
pink
flannel
off
to
prepare
for
lunch
harmony
sent
a
formal
note
to
peter
byrne
regretting
that
a
headache
kept
her
from
taking
the
afternoon
walk
as
she
had
promised
also
to
avoid
meeting
him
she
did
without
dinner
and
spent
the
afternoon
crying
herself
into
a
headache
that
was
real
enough
anna
gates
was
no
fool
while
she
made
her
few
preparations
for
dinner
she
repented
bitterly
what
she
had
said
to
harmony
it
is
difficult
for
the
sophistry
of
forty
to
remember
and
cherish
the
innocence
of
twenty
for
illusions
it
is
apt
to
substitute
facts
the
material
for
the
spiritual
the
body
against
the
soul
gates
from
her
school
of
general
practice
had
come
to
view
life
along
physiological
lines
with
her
customary
frankness
she
approached
peter
after
the
meal
i
been
making
mischief
peter
i
been
talking
too
much
as
certainly
not
about
me
doctor
out
of
my
blameless
life
about
you
as
a
representative
member
of
your
sex
i
a
peter
looked
serious
he
had
put
on
the
newly
pressed
suit
and
his
best
tie
and
was
looking
distinguished
and
just
now
rather
stern
to
whom
to
the
young
wells
person
frankly
peter
i
dare
say
at
this
moment
she
thinks
you
are
everything
you
should
be
because
i
said
you
were
only
human
why
it
should
be
evil
to
be
human
or
human
to
be
evil
i
can
not
imagine
said
peter
slowly
the
reason
for
any
conversation
about
nor
i
when
i
look
back
we
seemed
to
talk
about
other
things
but
it
always
ended
with
you
perhaps
you
were
our
one
subject
in
common
then
she
irritated
me
by
her
calm
confidence
the
world
was
good
everybody
was
good
she
would
find
a
safe
occupation
and
all
would
be
so
you
warned
her
against
me
said
peter
grimly
i
told
her
you
were
human
and
that
she
was
attractive
shall
i
make
with
myself
cui
bono
demanded
peter
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
the
mischief
is
gates
looked
up
at
him
i
in
love
with
you
myself
peter
she
said
gratefully
perhaps
it
is
the
tie
did
you
ever
eat
such
a
meal
chapter
vi
a
very
pale
and
dispirited
harmony
it
was
who
bathed
her
eyes
in
cold
water
that
evening
and
obeyed
little
olga
bitte
sum
the
chairs
round
the
were
only
half
occupied
a
free
concert
had
taken
some
sunday
excursions
others
the
little
bulgarian
secretly
considered
to
be
a
political
spy
was
never
about
on
this
one
evening
of
the
week
rumor
had
it
that
on
these
evenings
secreted
in
an
attic
room
far
off
in
the
sixteenth
district
he
wrote
and
sent
off
reports
of
what
he
had
learned
during
the
week
his
gleanings
from
tables
in
or
from
the
indiscreet
hours
after
midnight
in
the
cafe
where
the
austrian
military
was
wont
to
gather
and
drink
into
the
empty
chair
beside
harmony
peter
slid
his
long
figure
and
met
a
tremulous
bow
and
silence
from
the
head
of
the
table
frau
schwarz
was
talking
volubly
as
if
by
mere
sound
to
distract
attention
from
the
scantiness
of
the
meal
under
cover
of
the
babel
peter
spoke
to
the
girl
having
had
his
warning
his
tone
was
friendly
without
a
hint
of
the
intimacy
of
the
day
before
better
not
entirely
i
wish
you
had
sent
olga
to
me
for
some
tablets
no
one
needs
to
suffer
from
headache
when
five
grains
or
so
of
powder
will
help
i
am
afraid
of
headache
not
when
your
physician
prescribes
them
i
hope
this
was
the
right
note
harmony
brightened
a
little
after
all
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
man
himself
he
had
constituted
himself
her
physician
that
was
all
the
next
time
i
shall
send
good
he
responded
heartily
and
proceeded
to
make
such
a
meal
as
he
might
talking
little
and
nursing
by
a
careful
indifference
her
confidence
it
was
when
he
had
pushed
his
plate
away
and
lighted
a
cigarette
according
to
the
custom
of
the
pension
which
accorded
the
nicht
rauchen
sign
the
same
attention
that
it
did
to
the
portrait
of
the
deceased
herr
schwarz
that
he
turned
to
her
again
i
am
sorry
you
are
not
able
to
walk
it
promises
a
nice
peter
was
clever
harmony
expecting
an
invitation
to
walk
had
nerved
herself
to
a
cool
refusal
this
took
her
off
guard
then
you
do
not
prescribe
air
that
up
to
how
you
feel
if
you
care
to
go
out
and
do
mind
my
going
along
as
a
sort
of
old
dog
tray
i
have
anything
else
to
gates
eating
stewed
fruit
across
the
table
gave
peter
a
swift
glance
of
admiration
which
he
caught
and
acknowledged
he
was
rather
exultant
himself
certainly
he
had
been
adroit
i
rather
like
a
short
walk
it
will
make
me
sleep
said
harmony
who
had
missed
the
and
old
dog
tray
would
be
a
very
nice
companion
i
it
is
doubtful
however
if
anna
gates
would
have
applauded
peter
had
she
followed
the
two
in
their
rambling
walk
that
night
direction
mattering
little
and
companionship
everything
they
wandered
on
talking
of
immaterial
things
of
the
rough
pavements
of
the
shop
windows
of
the
gray
medieval
buildings
they
came
to
a
full
stop
in
front
of
the
votivkirche
and
discussed
gravely
the
twin
gothic
spires
and
the
benk
sculptures
on
the
facade
and
there
in
the
open
square
casting
diplomacy
to
the
winds
peter
byrne
turned
to
harmony
and
blurted
out
what
was
in
his
heart
look
here
he
said
you
do
care
a
rap
about
spires
i
believe
you
know
anything
about
them
i
do
what
did
that
idiot
of
a
woman
doctor
say
to
you
i
do
know
what
you
you
do
very
well
and
i
going
to
set
you
right
she
starts
out
with
two
premises
i
a
man
and
you
young
and
attractive
then
she
draws
some
sort
of
fool
deduction
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
see
why
we
need
discuss
it
said
poor
harmony
or
how
you
know
i
know
because
she
told
me
she
knew
she
had
been
a
fool
and
she
came
to
me
i
do
know
whether
it
makes
any
difference
to
you
or
not
but
we
started
out
so
well
and
then
to
have
it
spoiled
my
dear
girl
you
are
beautiful
and
i
know
it
that
all
the
more
reason
why
if
you
stand
for
it
you
need
some
one
to
look
after
you
i
not
say
like
a
brother
because
all
the
ones
i
ever
knew
were
darned
poor
brothers
to
their
sisters
but
some
one
who
will
keep
an
eye
on
you
and
who
is
going
to
fall
in
love
with
i
did
think
you
were
falling
in
love
with
me
nor
did
i
wish
you
certainly
not
besides
i
here
peter
byrne
had
another
inspiration
not
so
good
as
the
first
besides
there
is
somebody
at
home
you
understand
that
makes
it
all
right
does
it
a
girl
at
home
a
girl
said
peter
lying
manfully
how
very
nice
said
harmony
and
put
out
her
hand
peter
feeling
all
sorts
of
a
cheat
took
it
and
got
his
reward
in
a
complete
restoral
of
their
former
comradely
relations
from
abstractions
of
church
towers
and
street
paving
they
went
with
the
directness
of
the
young
to
themselves
thereafter
during
that
memorable
walk
they
talked
blissful
personalities
harmony
future
peter
career
money
or
its
lack
their
ambitions
their
hopes
even
and
here
was
intimacy
indeed
their
disappointments
their
failures
of
courage
their
occasional
loss
of
faith
in
themselves
the
first
real
snow
of
the
year
was
falling
as
they
turned
back
toward
the
pension
schwarz
a
damp
snow
that
stuck
fast
and
melted
with
a
chilly
cold
that
had
in
it
nothing
but
depression
the
upper
spires
of
the
votivkirche
were
hidden
in
a
gray
mist
the
trees
in
the
park
took
on
against
the
gloom
of
the
city
hall
a
snowy
luminosity
save
for
an
occasional
pedestrian
making
his
way
home
under
an
umbrella
the
streets
were
deserted
byrne
and
harmony
had
no
umbrella
but
the
girl
rejected
his
offer
of
a
taxicab
we
should
be
home
too
quickly
she
observed
naively
and
we
have
so
much
to
say
about
me
now
i
thought
that
perhaps
by
giving
english
lessons
in
the
afternoon
and
working
all
morning
at
my
music
and
so
on
and
on
square
after
square
with
peter
listening
gravely
his
head
bent
and
square
after
square
it
was
borne
in
on
him
what
a
precarious
future
stretched
before
this
girl
beside
him
how
very
slender
her
resources
how
more
than
dubious
the
outcome
poverty
which
had
only
stimulated
peter
byrne
in
the
past
ate
deep
into
his
soul
that
night
epochmaking
as
the
walk
had
been
seeing
that
it
had
reestablished
a
friendship
and
made
a
working
basis
for
future
comradely
relations
they
were
back
at
the
corner
of
the
alserstrasse
before
ten
as
they
turned
in
at
the
little
street
a
man
lurching
somewhat
almost
collided
with
harmony
he
was
a
short
person
with
a
carefully
curled
mustache
and
he
was
singing
not
loudly
but
with
all
his
maudlin
heart
in
his
voice
the
barcarolle
from
the
tales
of
hoffmann
he
saw
harmony
and
still
singing
planted
himself
in
her
path
when
byrne
would
have
pushed
him
aside
harmony
caught
his
arm
it
is
only
the
portier
from
the
lodge
she
said
the
portier
having
come
to
rest
on
a
throaty
and
rather
wavering
note
stood
before
harmony
bowing
the
fraulein
has
gone
and
i
am
very
sad
he
said
thickly
there
is
no
more
music
and
rosa
has
run
away
with
a
soldier
from
salzburg
who
has
only
one
but
think
harmony
said
in
german
no
more
practicing
in
the
early
dawn
no
young
ladies
bringing
mud
into
your
newscrubbed
hall
it
is
better
is
it
not
all
day
you
may
rest
and
smoke
byrne
led
harmony
past
the
drunken
portier
who
turned
with
caution
and
bowed
after
them
gute
nacht
he
called
kuss
die
hand
fraulein
four
rooms
and
the
salon
and
a
bath
of
the
as
they
went
up
the
hirschengasse
they
could
hear
him
pursuing
his
unsteady
way
down
the
street
and
singing
lustily
at
the
door
of
the
pension
schwarz
harmony
paused
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
one
question
you
honor
me
then
what
is
the
name
of
the
girl
back
home
peter
byrne
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
complete
void
as
to
feminine
names
he
offered
in
a
sort
of
panic
the
first
one
he
recalled
emma
what
a
nice
name
but
there
was
a
touch
of
disappointment
in
her
voice
harmony
had
a
lesson
the
next
day
she
was
a
favorite
pupil
with
the
master
out
of
so
much
musical
chaff
he
winnowed
only
now
and
then
a
grain
of
real
ability
and
harmony
had
that
scatchy
and
the
big
soprano
had
been
right
she
had
the
real
thing
the
short
lesson
had
a
way
with
harmony
of
lengthening
itself
to
an
hour
or
more
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
lady
secretary
in
the
anteroom
on
that
monday
harmony
had
pleased
the
old
man
to
one
of
his
rare
enthusiasms
six
months
he
said
and
you
will
go
back
to
your
america
and
show
them
how
over
here
we
teach
violin
i
will
a
letter
letters
give
you
and
you
shall
put
on
the
programme
of
your
concerts
that
you
are
my
pupil
is
it
not
so
harmony
was
drawing
on
her
worn
gloves
her
hands
trembled
a
little
with
the
praise
and
excitement
if
i
can
stay
so
long
she
answered
unsteadily
you
must
stay
have
i
so
long
labored
and
now
before
it
is
finished
you
talk
of
going
gott
im
himmel
it
is
a
matter
of
money
my
father
is
dead
and
unless
i
find
something
to
do
i
shall
have
to
go
the
master
had
heard
many
such
statements
they
never
ceased
to
rouse
his
ire
against
a
world
that
had
money
for
everything
but
music
he
spent
five
minutes
in
indignant
protest
then
but
you
are
clever
and
young
child
you
will
find
a
way
to
stay
perhaps
i
can
now
and
then
find
a
concert
for
it
was
a
lure
he
had
thrown
out
before
a
hook
without
a
bait
it
needed
no
bait
being
always
eagerly
swallowed
and
no
more
talk
of
going
away
i
refuse
to
allow
you
shall
not
harmony
paid
the
lady
secretary
on
her
way
out
the
master
was
interested
he
liked
harmony
and
he
believed
in
her
but
fifty
kronen
is
fifty
kronen
and
south
american
beef
is
high
of
price
he
followed
harmony
into
the
outer
room
and
bowed
her
out
of
his
studio
the
fraulein
has
paid
he
demanded
turning
sharply
to
the
lady
secretary
after
the
lesson
ja
herr
it
is
better
said
the
master
that
she
pay
hereafter
before
the
ja
herr
whereupon
the
lady
secretary
put
a
cross
before
harmony
name
there
were
many
such
crosses
on
the
ledger
chapter
vii
for
three
days
byrne
hardly
saw
harmony
he
was
off
early
in
the
morning
hurried
back
to
the
midday
meal
and
was
gone
again
the
moment
it
was
over
he
had
lectures
in
the
evenings
too
and
although
he
lingered
for
an
hour
or
so
after
supper
it
was
to
find
harmony
taken
possession
of
by
the
little
bulgarian
seized
with
a
sudden
thirst
for
things
american
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
he
had
left
harmony
enmeshed
and
helpless
in
a
tangle
of
language
trying
to
explain
to
the
little
bulgarian
the
reason
american
women
wished
to
vote
byrne
flung
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
almost
colliding
with
stewart
they
walked
on
together
stewart
with
the
comfortably
rolling
gait
of
the
man
who
has
just
dined
well
byrne
with
his
heavy
rather
solid
tread
the
two
men
were
not
congenial
and
the
frequent
intervals
without
speech
between
them
were
rather
for
lack
of
understanding
than
for
that
completeness
of
it
which
often
fathers
long
silences
byrne
was
the
first
to
speak
after
their
greeting
marie
all
right
fine
said
if
i
saw
you
to
ask
you
to
supper
some
night
this
thanks
does
it
matter
which
night
any
but
thursday
we
hearing
boheme
say
friday
byrne
tone
lacked
enthusiasm
but
stewart
in
his
mood
failed
to
notice
it
have
you
thought
any
more
about
our
conversation
of
the
other
night
what
was
that
stewart
poked
him
playfully
in
the
ribs
wake
up
byrne
he
said
you
remember
well
enough
neither
the
days
nor
any
one
else
is
going
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
assistance
if
you
go
on
living
the
way
you
have
been
i
was
at
schwarz
it
is
the
double
drain
there
that
tells
on
one
eating
little
and
being
eaten
much
those
old
walls
are
full
of
vermin
why
do
you
take
our
apartment
yours
yes
for
a
couple
of
months
i
through
with
schleich
and
breidau
ca
take
me
for
two
months
it
marie
off
season
and
we
going
to
semmering
for
the
winter
sports
we
ahead
enough
to
take
a
holiday
and
if
you
want
the
flat
for
the
same
amount
you
are
spending
now
or
less
you
can
have
it
and
a
home
old
byrne
was
irritated
the
more
so
that
he
realized
that
the
offer
tempted
him
to
his
resentment
was
added
a
contempt
of
himself
thanks
he
said
i
think
oh
all
stewart
was
rather
offended
i
ca
do
more
than
give
you
a
they
separated
shortly
after
and
byrne
went
on
alone
the
snow
of
sunday
had
turned
to
a
fine
rain
which
had
lasted
all
of
monday
and
tuesday
the
sidewalks
were
slimy
wagons
slid
in
the
ooze
of
the
streets
and
the
smoke
from
the
little
stoves
in
the
followed
them
in
depressing
horizontal
clouds
cabmen
sat
and
smoked
in
the
interior
of
musty
cabs
the
women
on
a
new
building
steamed
like
horses
as
they
worked
byrne
walked
along
his
head
thrust
down
into
his
collar
moisture
gathered
on
his
face
like
dew
condensed
rather
than
precipitated
and
as
he
walked
there
came
before
him
a
vision
of
the
little
flat
on
the
hochgasse
with
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
the
general
air
of
warmth
and
cheer
and
a
figure
presiding
over
the
brick
stove
in
the
kitchen
byrne
shook
himself
like
a
great
dog
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
hospital
he
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
that
week
was
full
of
disappointments
for
harmony
wherever
she
turned
she
faced
a
wall
of
indifference
or
what
was
worse
an
interest
that
frightened
her
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
she
beat
helplessly
against
barriers
of
language
of
strange
customs
of
stolidity
that
were
not
far
from
absolute
cruelty
she
held
to
her
determination
however
at
first
with
hope
then
as
the
pension
in
advance
and
the
lessons
at
fifty
kronen
also
in
advance
went
on
recklessly
she
played
marvelously
those
days
crying
out
through
her
violin
the
despair
she
had
sealed
her
lips
against
on
thursday
playing
for
the
master
she
turned
to
find
him
flourishing
his
handkerchief
and
went
home
in
a
sort
of
daze
incredulous
that
she
could
have
moved
him
to
tears
the
little
bulgarian
was
frankly
her
slave
now
he
had
given
up
the
that
he
might
spend
that
hour
near
her
on
the
chance
of
seeing
her
or
failing
that
of
hearing
her
play
at
night
in
the
cafe
hungaria
he
sat
for
hours
at
a
time
his
elbows
on
the
table
a
bottle
of
native
wine
before
him
and
dreamed
of
her
he
was
very
fat
the
little
georgiev
very
swarthy
very
pathetic
the
balkan
kettle
was
simmering
in
those
days
and
he
had
been
set
to
watch
the
fire
but
instead
he
had
kindled
a
flame
of
his
own
and
was
feeding
it
with
stray
words
odd
glances
a
bit
of
music
the
curve
of
a
woman
hair
behind
her
ears
for
reports
he
wrote
verses
in
modern
greek
and
through
one
of
those
inadvertences
which
make
tragedy
the
minister
of
war
down
in
troubled
bulgaria
once
received
between
the
pages
of
a
report
in
cipher
on
the
fortifications
of
the
danube
a
verse
in
fervid
hexameter
that
made
even
that
grim
official
smile
harmony
was
quite
unconscious
she
went
on
her
way
methodically
so
many
hours
of
work
so
many
lessons
at
fifty
kronen
so
many
afternoons
searching
for
something
to
do
making
rounds
of
shops
where
her
english
might
be
valuable
and
after
a
few
weeks
peter
byrne
found
time
to
help
after
one
experience
when
harmony
left
a
shop
with
flaming
face
and
tears
in
her
eyes
he
had
thought
it
best
to
go
with
her
the
first
interview
under
peter
grim
eyes
was
a
failure
the
shopkeeper
was
obviously
suspicious
of
peter
after
that
whenever
he
could
escape
from
clinics
peter
went
along
but
stayed
outside
smoking
his
eternal
cigarette
and
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
things
inside
the
shop
only
once
was
he
needed
at
that
time
suspecting
that
all
was
not
well
from
the
girl
eyes
and
the
leer
on
the
shopkeeper
face
he
had
opened
the
door
in
time
to
hear
enough
he
had
lifted
the
proprietor
bodily
and
flung
him
with
a
crash
into
a
glass
showcase
of
ornaments
for
the
hair
then
entirely
cheerful
and
happy
and
unmolested
by
the
frightened
clerks
he
led
harmony
outside
and
in
a
sort
of
atavistic
triumph
bought
her
a
bunch
of
valley
lilies
nevertheless
in
his
sane
moments
peter
knew
that
things
were
very
bad
indeed
he
was
still
not
in
love
with
the
girl
he
analyzed
his
own
feeling
very
carefully
and
that
was
his
conclusion
nevertheless
he
did
a
quixotic
thing
which
was
peter
of
course
all
over
he
took
supper
with
stewart
and
marie
on
friday
and
the
idea
came
to
him
there
hardly
came
to
him
being
marie
originally
the
little
flat
was
cozy
and
bright
marie
having
straightened
her
kitchen
brought
in
a
waist
she
was
making
and
sat
sewing
while
the
two
men
talked
their
conversation
was
technical
a
new
extirpation
of
the
thyroid
gland
a
recent
nephrectomy
in
her
curious
way
marie
liked
peter
and
respected
him
she
struggled
with
the
technicalities
of
their
talk
as
she
sewed
finding
here
and
there
a
comprehensive
bit
at
those
times
she
sat
needle
poised
intelligent
eyes
on
the
speakers
until
she
lost
herself
again
in
the
mazes
of
their
english
at
ten
she
rose
and
put
away
her
sewing
peter
saw
her
get
the
stone
pitcher
and
knew
she
was
on
her
way
for
the
evening
beer
he
took
advantage
of
her
absence
to
broach
the
matter
of
harmony
she
up
against
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
finished
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
for
her
to
find
something
but
it
i
hardly
saw
her
that
day
in
the
but
she
rather
handsome
is
she
that
one
of
the
difficulties
stewart
smoked
and
reflected
no
friends
here
at
all
none
there
were
three
girls
at
first
two
have
gone
could
she
teach
violin
i
should
think
are
there
any
kids
in
the
american
colony
who
want
lessons
usually
some
sort
of
infant
prodigy
ready
to
play
at
any
entertainments
of
the
doctors
they
do
want
an
american
teacher
i
fancy
but
i
suppose
i
could
put
a
card
up
in
the
club
rooms
damn
it
all
cried
peter
with
a
burst
of
honest
resentment
why
do
i
have
to
be
poor
if
you
were
rolling
in
gold
you
could
hardly
offer
her
money
could
you
peter
had
not
thought
of
that
before
it
was
the
only
comfort
he
found
in
his
poverty
marie
had
brought
in
the
beer
and
was
carefully
filling
the
mugs
why
do
you
not
marry
her
she
asked
unexpectedly
then
you
could
take
this
flat
we
are
going
to
semmering
for
the
winter
sports
i
would
show
her
about
the
marry
her
of
course
said
peter
gravely
just
pick
her
up
and
carry
her
to
church
the
trifling
fact
that
she
does
not
wish
to
marry
me
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
ah
but
does
she
not
wish
it
demanded
marie
are
you
so
certain
stupid
big
one
do
not
women
always
love
you
ridiculous
as
the
thought
was
peter
pondered
it
as
he
went
back
to
the
pension
schwarz
about
himself
he
was
absurdly
modest
almost
humble
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
women
might
care
for
him
for
himself
in
his
struggling
life
there
had
been
little
time
for
women
but
about
himself
as
the
solution
of
a
problem
that
was
different
he
argued
the
thing
over
in
the
unlikely
contingency
of
the
being
willing
was
stewart
right
could
two
people
live
as
cheaply
as
one
marie
was
an
austrian
and
knew
how
to
manage
that
was
different
and
another
thing
troubled
him
he
dreaded
to
disturb
the
delicate
adjustment
of
their
relationship
the
terra
incognita
of
a
young
girl
mind
daunted
him
there
was
another
consideration
which
he
put
resolutely
in
the
back
of
his
mind
his
career
he
had
seen
many
a
promising
one
killed
by
early
marriage
men
driven
to
the
hack
work
of
the
profession
by
the
scourge
of
financial
necessity
but
that
was
a
matter
of
the
future
the
necessity
was
immediate
the
night
was
very
cold
gusts
of
wind
from
the
schneeberg
drove
along
the
streets
making
each
corner
a
fortress
defended
by
the
elements
a
battlement
to
be
seized
lost
seized
again
peter
byrne
battled
valiantly
but
mechanically
and
as
he
fought
he
made
his
decision
he
acted
with
characteristic
promptness
possibly
too
he
was
afraid
of
the
strength
of
his
own
resolution
by
morning
sanity
might
prevail
and
in
cold
daylight
he
would
see
the
absurdity
of
his
position
he
almost
ran
up
the
winding
staircase
at
the
top
his
cold
fingers
fumbled
the
key
and
he
swore
under
his
breath
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
peter
always
slammed
doors
and
had
an
apologetic
way
of
opening
the
door
again
and
closing
it
gently
as
if
to
show
that
he
could
harmony
room
was
dark
but
he
had
surprised
her
once
into
a
confession
that
when
she
was
very
downhearted
she
liked
to
sit
in
the
dark
and
be
very
blue
indeed
so
he
stopped
and
knocked
there
was
no
reply
but
from
gates
room
across
there
came
a
hum
of
conversation
he
knew
at
once
that
harmony
was
there
peter
hardly
hesitated
he
took
off
his
soft
hat
and
ran
a
hand
over
his
hair
and
he
straightened
his
tie
these
preliminaries
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
being
disposed
of
he
rapped
at
the
door
anna
gates
opened
it
she
wore
a
hideous
wrapper
and
in
deference
to
harmony
a
thimble
her
flat
breast
was
stuck
with
pins
and
pinkish
threads
revealed
the
fact
that
the
bathrobe
was
still
under
way
peter
she
cried
come
in
and
get
harmony
in
the
blue
kimono
gave
a
little
gasp
and
flung
round
her
shoulders
the
mass
of
pink
on
which
she
had
been
working
please
go
out
she
said
i
am
not
you
are
covered
returned
anna
gates
that
all
that
any
sort
of
clothing
can
do
do
mind
her
peter
and
sit
on
the
bed
look
out
for
pins
peter
however
did
not
sit
down
he
stood
just
inside
the
closed
door
and
stared
at
harmony
harmony
in
the
red
light
from
the
little
open
door
of
the
stove
harmony
in
blue
and
pink
and
a
bit
of
white
petticoat
harmony
with
her
hair
over
her
shoulders
and
tied
out
of
her
eyes
with
an
encircling
band
of
rosy
flannel
do
sit
cried
anna
gates
you
fill
the
room
so
bless
you
peter
what
a
collar
no
man
likes
to
know
his
collar
is
soiled
especially
on
the
eve
of
proposing
marriage
to
a
pink
and
blue
and
white
vision
peter
seated
now
on
the
bed
writhed
i
rapped
at
miss
wells
door
he
said
you
were
not
this
last
of
course
to
harmony
anna
gates
sniffed
naturally
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
i
i
dare
say
it
is
hardly
pension
etiquette
for
you
to
go
over
to
your
room
and
let
me
say
it
there
harmony
smiled
above
the
flannel
could
you
call
it
through
the
door
fiddlesticks
said
gates
rising
i
go
over
of
course
but
not
for
long
there
no
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
however
harmony
interfered
please
she
implored
i
am
not
dressed
and
i
rather
she
turned
to
peter
you
can
say
it
before
her
ca
you
she
i
have
told
her
all
about
peter
hesitated
he
felt
ridiculous
for
the
second
time
that
night
then
it
was
merely
an
idea
i
had
i
saw
a
little
apartment
furnished
you
could
learn
to
use
the
stove
unless
of
course
you
do
like
housekeeping
and
food
is
really
awfully
cheap
why
at
these
delicatessen
places
and
bakeshops
here
he
paused
for
breath
and
found
gates
quizzical
glance
fixed
on
him
and
harmony
startled
eyes
what
i
am
trying
to
say
he
exploded
is
that
i
believe
if
you
would
marry
me
it
would
solve
some
of
your
troubles
he
was
talking
for
time
now
against
harmony
incredulous
face
you
be
taking
on
others
of
course
i
not
much
and
i
as
poor
well
you
know
it
it
was
the
apartment
that
gave
me
the
idea
and
the
stove
said
harmony
and
suddenly
burst
into
joyous
laughter
after
a
rather
shocked
instant
gates
joined
her
it
was
real
mirth
with
harmony
the
first
laugh
of
days
that
curious
laughter
of
women
that
is
not
far
from
tears
peter
sat
on
the
bed
uncomfortably
he
grinned
sheepishly
and
made
a
last
feeble
attempt
to
stick
to
his
guns
i
mean
it
you
know
i
not
in
love
with
you
or
you
with
me
of
course
but
we
are
such
a
pair
of
waifs
and
i
thought
we
might
get
along
lord
knows
i
need
some
one
to
look
after
me
and
emma
there
is
no
emma
i
made
her
harmony
sobered
at
that
it
is
only
she
gasped
a
little
for
breath
it
is
only
your
your
transparency
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
called
him
peter
you
know
how
things
are
with
me
and
you
want
to
help
me
and
out
of
your
generosity
you
are
willing
to
take
on
another
burden
oh
peter
and
here
harmony
being
an
emotional
young
person
the
tears
beat
the
laughter
to
the
surface
and
had
to
be
wiped
away
under
the
cover
of
mirth
anna
gates
having
recovered
herself
sat
back
and
surveyed
them
both
sternly
through
her
glasses
once
for
all
she
said
brusquely
let
such
foolishness
end
peter
i
am
ashamed
of
you
marriage
is
not
for
you
not
yet
not
for
a
dozen
years
any
man
can
saddle
himself
with
a
wife
not
every
man
can
be
what
you
may
be
if
you
keep
your
senses
and
stay
single
and
the
same
is
true
for
you
girl
to
tide
over
a
bad
six
months
you
would
sacrifice
the
very
thing
you
are
both
struggling
for
i
sure
we
do
intend
to
do
it
replied
harmony
meekly
not
now
some
day
you
may
be
tempted
when
that
time
comes
remember
what
i
say
matrimonially
speaking
each
of
you
is
fatal
to
the
other
now
go
away
and
let
me
alone
i
not
accustomed
to
proposals
of
it
was
in
some
confusion
of
mind
that
peter
byrne
took
himself
off
to
the
bedroom
with
the
cold
tiled
stove
and
the
bed
that
was
as
comfortable
as
a
washtub
undeniably
he
was
relieved
also
problem
was
yet
unsolved
also
she
had
called
him
peter
also
he
had
said
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
was
he
so
sure
of
that
at
midnight
just
as
peter
rolled
in
the
bedclothing
had
managed
to
warm
the
cold
concavity
of
his
bed
and
had
dozed
off
anna
gates
knocked
at
his
door
yes
said
peter
still
comfortably
asleep
it
is
sorry
doctor
have
to
me
mumbled
peter
from
the
blanket
peter
peter
roused
to
a
chilled
and
indignant
consciousness
and
sat
up
in
bed
well
open
the
door
just
a
resignedly
peter
crawled
out
of
bed
carefully
turning
the
coverings
up
to
retain
as
much
heat
as
possible
an
icy
blast
from
the
open
window
blew
round
him
setting
everything
movable
in
the
little
room
to
quivering
he
fumbled
in
the
dark
for
his
slippers
failed
to
find
them
and
yawning
noisily
went
to
the
door
anna
gates
with
a
candle
was
outside
her
short
graying
hair
was
out
of
its
hard
knot
and
hung
in
an
equally
uncompromising
plait
down
her
back
she
had
no
glasses
and
over
the
she
peered
shortsightedly
at
peter
it
about
jimmy
she
said
i
do
know
what
got
into
me
but
forgotten
for
three
days
it
a
good
bit
more
than
time
for
a
great
scott
both
yesterday
and
he
asked
for
it
and
he
fretted
a
little
the
nurse
found
him
the
poor
little
devil
said
peter
contritely
overdue
is
it
fix
it
leave
it
under
the
door
where
i
can
get
it
in
the
morning
i
off
at
the
envelope
here
it
is
and
take
my
candle
i
going
to
that
was
at
midnight
or
shortly
after
half
after
one
struck
from
the
twin
clocks
of
the
votivkirche
and
echoed
from
the
stephansplatz
across
the
city
it
found
peter
with
the
window
closed
sitting
up
in
bed
a
candle
balanced
on
one
knee
a
on
the
other
he
was
writing
a
spirited
narrative
of
a
chamois
hunt
in
which
he
had
taken
part
that
day
including
a
detailed
description
of
the
quarry
which
weighed
according
to
peter
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
peter
being
strong
on
imagination
and
short
on
facts
as
regards
the
alpine
chamois
then
trying
to
read
the
letter
from
a
small
boy
point
of
view
and
deciding
that
it
lacked
snap
he
added
by
way
of
postscript
a
harrowing
incident
of
avalanche
rope
guide
and
ice
axe
he
ended
in
a
sort
of
glow
of
authorship
and
after
some
thought
took
fifty
pounds
off
the
chamois
the
letter
finished
he
put
it
in
a
envelope
addressed
to
jimmy
conroy
an
envelope
that
stamped
the
whole
episode
as
authentic
bearing
as
it
did
an
undecipherable
date
and
the
postmark
of
a
tiny
village
in
the
austrian
tyrol
it
was
almost
two
when
peter
put
out
the
candle
and
settled
himself
to
sleep
it
was
just
two
when
the
night
nurse
making
rounds
in
her
ward
in
the
general
hospital
found
a
small
boy
very
much
awake
on
his
pillow
and
taking
off
her
felt
slipper
shook
it
at
him
in
pretended
fury
now
thou
bad
one
she
said
awake
when
the
herr
doktor
orders
sleep
shall
i
use
the
slipper
the
boy
replied
in
german
with
a
strong
english
accent
i
can
not
sleep
yesterday
the
fraulein
elisabet
said
that
in
the
mountains
there
are
accidents
and
that
sometimes
the
fraulein
elisabet
is
a
great
fool
tomorrow
comes
thy
letter
of
a
certainty
the
post
has
been
delayed
with
great
snows
thy
father
has
perhaps
captured
a
great
boar
or
a
a
chamois
and
he
writes
of
do
chamois
have
horns
ja
great
horns
he
will
send
them
to
me
and
there
are
no
accidents
none
now

the
chapter
viii
so
far
harmony
small
world
in
the
old
city
had
consisted
of
scatchy
and
the
big
soprano
peter
and
anna
gates
with
far
off
in
the
firmament
the
master
scatchy
and
the
big
soprano
had
gone
weeping
anxious
postcards
from
every
way
station
it
is
true
but
nevertheless
gone
peter
and
anna
gates
remained
and
the
master
as
long
as
her
funds
held
out
to
them
now
she
was
about
to
add
jimmy
the
bathrobe
was
finished
out
of
the
little
doctor
chaos
of
pink
flannel
harmony
had
brought
order
the
result
masculine
and
complete
even
to
its
tassels
and
cord
of
pink
yarn
was
ready
to
be
presented
it
was
with
mingled
emotions
that
anna
gates
wrapped
it
up
and
gave
it
to
harmony
the
next
morning
he
has
been
so
well
the
last
day
or
two
she
said
he
sleep
much
that
the
worst
of
those
heart
conditions
sometimes
while
i
been
working
on
this
thing
i
wondered
well
we
making
a
fight
anyhow
and
better
take
the
letter
too
harry
i
might
forget
and
make
lecture
notes
on
it
and
if
i
spoil
that
envelope
harmony
had
arranged
to
carry
the
bathrobe
to
the
hospital
meeting
the
doctor
there
after
her
early
clinic
she
knew
jimmy
little
story
quite
well
anna
gates
had
told
it
to
her
in
detail
just
one
of
the
tragedies
of
the
world
my
dear
she
had
finished
you
think
you
have
a
tragedy
but
you
have
youth
and
hope
i
think
i
have
my
own
little
tragedy
because
i
have
to
go
through
the
rest
of
life
alone
when
taken
in
time
i
have
been
a
good
wife
and
mother
still
i
have
my
work
but
this
little
chap
brought
over
here
by
a
father
who
hoped
to
see
him
cured
and
spent
all
he
had
to
bring
him
here
and
then
died
it
gets
me
by
the
and
the
boy
does
not
know
harmony
had
asked
her
eyes
wide
no
thanks
to
peter
he
thinks
his
father
is
still
in
the
mountains
when
we
heard
about
it
peter
went
up
and
saw
that
he
was
buried
it
took
about
all
the
money
there
was
he
wrote
home
about
it
too
to
the
place
they
came
from
there
has
never
been
any
reply
then
ever
since
peter
has
written
these
letters
jimmy
lives
for
peter
it
was
always
peter
peter
did
this
peter
said
that
peter
thought
thus
a
very
large
part
of
harmony
life
was
peter
in
those
days
she
was
thinking
of
him
as
she
waited
at
the
gate
of
the
hospital
for
anna
gates
thinking
of
his
shabby
gray
suit
and
unkempt
hair
of
his
letter
that
she
carried
to
jimmy
conroy
of
his
quixotic
proposal
of
the
night
before
of
the
proposal
most
of
all
it
was
so
eminently
characteristic
of
peter
from
the
conception
of
the
plan
to
its
execution
harmony
thought
of
peter
was
very
tender
that
morning
as
she
stood
in
the
arched
gateway
out
of
reach
of
the
wind
from
the
schneeberg
the
tenderness
and
the
bright
color
brought
by
the
wind
made
her
very
beautiful
little
marie
waiting
across
the
alserstrasse
for
a
bus
and
stamping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
to
keep
warm
recognized
and
admired
her
after
all
the
american
women
were
chic
she
decided
although
some
of
the
doctors
had
wives
of
a
dowdiness
himmel
and
she
could
copy
the
fraulein
hat
for
two
kronen
and
a
bit
of
ribbon
she
possessed
the
presentation
of
the
bathrobe
was
a
success
six
nurses
and
a
dozent
with
a
red
beard
stood
about
and
watched
jimmy
put
into
it
and
the
dozent
who
had
been
engaged
for
five
years
and
could
not
marry
because
the
hospital
board
forbade
it
made
a
speech
for
jimmy
in
german
ending
up
with
a
poem
that
was
intended
to
be
funny
but
that
made
the
nurses
cry
from
which
it
will
be
seen
that
jimmy
was
a
great
favorite
during
the
ceremony
for
such
it
was
the
germans
loving
a
ceremony
jimmy
kept
his
eyes
on
the
letter
in
anna
gates
hand
and
waited
that
the
letter
had
come
was
enough
he
lay
back
in
anticipatory
joy
and
let
himself
be
talked
over
and
bathrobed
and
his
hair
parted
austrian
fashion
and
turned
up
over
a
finger
which
is
very
austrian
indeed
he
liked
harmony
the
girl
caught
his
eyes
on
her
more
than
once
he
interrupted
the
speech
once
to
ask
her
just
what
part
of
the
robe
she
had
made
and
whether
she
had
made
the
tassel
when
she
admitted
the
tassel
his
admiration
became
mixed
with
respect
it
was
a
bright
day
for
a
marvel
sunlight
came
through
the
barred
window
behind
jimmy
bed
and
brought
into
dazzling
radiance
the
pink
bathrobe
and
harmony
eyes
and
fat
nurse
elisabet
white
apron
it
lay
on
the
bedspread
in
great
squares
outlined
by
the
shadows
of
the
window
bars
now
and
then
the
sentry
pacing
outside
would
advance
as
far
as
jimmy
window
and
a
warlike
silhouette
of
military
cap
and
the
upper
end
of
a
carbine
would
appear
on
the
coverlet
these
events
however
were
rare
the
sentry
preferring
the
shelter
of
the
gateway
and
the
odor
of
boiling
onions
from
the
lodge
just
inside
the
dozent
retired
to
his
room
for
the
second
breakfast
the
nurses
went
about
the
business
of
the
ward
anna
gates
drew
a
hairpin
from
her
hair
and
made
a
great
show
of
opening
the
many
times
opened
envelope
the
letter
at
last
she
said
shall
i
read
it
or
will
you
you
read
it
it
takes
me
so
long
i
read
it
all
day
after
you
are
gone
i
always
anna
gates
read
the
letter
she
read
aloud
poor
peter
first
halting
lines
when
he
was
struggling
against
sleep
and
cold
they
were
mainly
an
apology
for
the
delay
then
forgetting
discomfort
in
the
joy
of
creation
he
became
more
comfortable
the
account
of
the
was
wonderfully
graphic
the
description
of
the
chamois
was
fervid
if
not
accurate
but
consternation
came
with
the
end
the
letter
apparently
finished
there
was
yet
another
sheet
the
doctor
read
on
for
heaven
sake
said
peter
frantic
postscript
find
out
how
much
a
chamois
gates
stopped
ought
to
weigh
was
the
rest
of
it
and
fix
it
right
in
the
letter
the
kid
too
smart
to
be
fooled
and
i
never
saw
a
chamois
outside
of
a
drug
store
they
have
horns
have
they
that
funny
said
jimmy
conway
that
was
one
of
my
papers
slipped
in
by
mistake
remarked
gates
with
dignity
and
flashing
a
wild
appeal
for
help
to
harmony
how
did
one
of
your
papers
get
in
when
it
was
sealed
i
think
observed
harmony
leaning
forward
that
little
boys
must
not
ask
too
many
questions
especially
when
christmas
is
only
six
weeks
i
know
he
wants
to
send
me
the
horns
the
way
he
sent
me
the
for
peter
having
in
one
letter
unwisely
recorded
the
slaughter
of
a
boar
had
been
obliged
to
ransack
vienna
for
a
pair
of
tusks
the
tusks
had
not
been
so
difficult
but
horns
jimmy
was
contented
with
his
solution
and
asked
no
more
questions
the
morning
excitement
had
tired
him
and
he
lay
back
gates
went
to
hold
a
whispered
consultation
with
the
nurse
and
came
back
looking
grave
the
boy
was
asleep
holding
the
letter
in
his
thin
hands
the
visit
to
the
hospital
was
a
good
thing
for
harmony
to
find
some
one
worse
off
than
she
was
to
satisfy
that
eternal
desire
of
women
to
do
something
however
small
for
some
one
else
her
own
troubles
looked
very
small
to
her
that
day
as
she
left
the
hospital
and
stepped
out
into
the
bright
sunshine
she
passed
the
impassive
sentry
then
turned
and
went
back
to
him
do
you
wish
to
do
a
very
kind
thing
she
asked
in
german
now
the
conversation
of
an
austrian
sentry
consists
of
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
and
not
always
that
but
harmony
was
lovely
and
the
sun
was
moderating
the
wind
the
sentry
looked
round
no
one
was
near
what
do
you
wish
inside
that
third
window
is
a
small
boy
and
he
is
very
ill
i
do
not
think
perhaps
he
will
never
be
well
again
could
you
not
now
and
then
pass
the
window
it
pleases
pass
the
window
but
why
in
america
we
see
few
of
our
soldiers
he
likes
to
see
you
and
the
ah
the
gun
he
smiled
and
nodded
in
comprehension
then
as
an
officer
appeared
in
the
door
of
a
across
the
street
he
stiffened
into
immobility
and
stared
past
harmony
into
space
but
the
girl
knew
he
would
do
as
she
had
desired
that
day
brought
good
luck
to
harmony
the
wife
of
one
of
the
professors
at
the
hospital
desired
english
conversation
at
two
kronen
an
hour
peter
brought
the
news
home
at
noon
and
that
afternoon
harmony
was
engaged
it
was
little
enough
but
it
was
something
it
did
much
more
than
offer
her
two
kronen
an
hour
it
gave
her
back
her
although
the
immediate
result
was
rather
tragic
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
infatuated
with
english
and
with
harmony
engaged
her
and
took
her
first
two
kronen
worth
that
afternoon
it
was
the
day
for
a
harmony
arrived
five
minutes
late
panting
hat
awry
and
so
full
of
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
obedient
to
orders
she
had
placed
the
envelope
containing
her
fifty
kronen
before
the
secretary
as
she
went
in
the
master
was
out
of
humor
should
he
the
teacher
of
the
great
koert
be
kept
waiting
for
a
chit
of
a
girl
only
of
course
he
said
das
kindchen
or
some
other
german
equivalent
for
chit
and
then
have
her
come
into
the
sacred
presence
breathless
and
salute
him
between
gasps
as
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
being
excited
and
now
confused
by
her
error
and
being
also
rather
tremulous
with
three
flights
of
stairs
at
top
speed
harmony
dropped
her
bow
in
point
of
heinousness
this
classes
with
dropping
one
infant
child
from
an
upper
window
or
sitting
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
carriage
when
with
a
lady
the
master
thus
thrice
outraged
rose
slowly
and
glared
at
harmony
then
with
a
lordly
gesture
to
her
to
follow
he
stalked
to
the
outer
room
and
picking
up
the
envelope
with
the
fifty
kronen
held
it
out
to
her
without
a
word
harmony
world
came
crashing
about
her
ears
she
stared
stupidly
at
the
envelope
in
her
hand
at
the
master
retreating
back
two
girl
students
waiting
their
turn
envelopes
in
hand
giggled
together
harmony
saw
them
and
flushed
scarlet
but
the
lady
secretary
touched
her
arm
it
does
not
matter
fraulein
he
does
so
sometimes
always
he
is
sorry
you
will
come
for
your
next
lesson
not
so
and
all
will
be
well
you
are
his
pupil
he
will
not
eat
for
grief
that
he
has
hurt
the
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
shabby
secretary
voice
was
unmistakable
her
tense
throat
relaxed
she
looked
across
at
the
two
students
who
had
laughed
they
were
not
laughing
now
something
of
fellowship
and
understanding
passed
between
them
in
the
glance
after
all
it
was
in
the
day
work
would
come
to
one
of
them
next
perhaps
and
they
had
much
in
common
the
struggle
their
faith
the
everlasting
loneliness
the
little
white
envelopes
each
with
its
fifty
kronen
vaguely
comforted
but
with
the
light
gone
out
of
her
day
of
days
harmony
went
down
the
three
long
flights
and
out
into
the
brightness
of
the
winter
day
on
the
ring
she
almost
ran
into
peter
he
was
striding
toward
her
giving
a
definite
impression
of
being
bound
for
some
particular
destination
and
of
being
behind
time
that
this
was
not
the
case
was
shown
by
the
celerity
with
which
when
he
saw
harmony
he
turned
about
and
walked
with
her
i
had
an
hour
or
two
he
explained
and
i
thought
i
walk
but
walking
is
a
social
habit
like
drinking
i
hate
to
walk
alone
how
about
the
frau
professor
she
has
taken
me
on
i
very
happy
but
byrne
you
called
me
peter
last
that
was
different
you
had
just
proposed
to
oh
if
that
all
that
necessary
he
stopped
in
the
center
of
the
busy
ring
with
every
evident
intention
of
proposing
again
please
peter
aha
victory
well
what
about
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
she
asks
so
many
questions
about
america
and
i
can
not
answer
for
instance
well
taxes
now
she
very
much
interested
in
never
owned
anything
taxable
except
a
dog
and
that
was
a
tax
anyhow
it
was
a
license
ca
you
switch
her
on
to
medicine
or
surgery
where
i
be
of
some
use
she
says
we
talk
of
the
tariff
and
customs
well
i
got
something
to
say
on
he
pulled
from
his
overcoat
pocket
a
largish
bundle
peter
always
bulged
with
packages
and
held
it
out
for
her
to
see
tell
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
with
my
compliments
he
said
that
because
some
idiot
at
home
sent
me
five
pounds
of
tobacco
hearing
from
afar
my
groans
over
the
tobacco
here
i
have
passed
from
mere
financial
stress
to
destitution
the
austrian
customs
have
taken
from
me
the
equivalent
of
ten
dollars
in
duty
i
offered
them
the
tobacco
on
bended
knee
but
they
scorned
really
peter
under
this
lightness
harmony
sensed
the
real
anxiety
ten
dollars
was
fifty
kronen
and
fifty
kronen
was
a
great
deal
of
money
she
reached
over
and
patted
his
arm
you
make
it
up
in
some
way
ca
you
cut
off
some
little
extravagance
i
might
cut
down
on
my
tailor
he
looked
down
at
himself
whimsically
or
on
ties
i
positively
reckless
about
ties
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
detachment
of
soldiery
busy
with
that
eternal
military
activity
that
seems
to
get
nowhere
passed
on
a
peter
looked
at
them
critically
bosnians
he
observed
raw
troops
from
bosnia
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
tubercular
it
a
rotten
game
this
military
play
of
europe
how
jimmy
we
left
him
very
happy
with
your
peter
flushed
i
expect
it
was
pretty
poor
stuff
he
apologized
never
seen
the
alps
except
from
a
train
window
and
as
for
a
chamois
he
says
his
father
will
surely
send
him
the
peter
groaned
of
course
he
said
why
in
heaven
name
did
i
make
it
an
eagle
one
can
always
buy
a
feather
or
two
but
horns
he
really
liked
the
letter
he
adored
it
he
went
to
sleep
almost
at
once
with
it
in
his
peter
glowed
the
small
irritation
of
the
forgotten
he
talked
of
jimmy
of
what
had
been
done
and
might
still
be
done
if
only
there
were
money
and
from
jimmy
he
talked
boy
he
had
had
a
boys
club
at
home
during
his
short
experience
in
general
practice
boys
were
his
hobby
scum
of
the
earth
most
of
them
he
said
his
plain
face
glowing
dirty
little
beggars
off
the
street
at
first
they
stole
my
tobacco
and
one
of
them
pawned
a
medical
book
or
two
then
they
got
to
playing
the
game
right
by
jove
harmony
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
them
used
to
line
up
and
make
spell
and
the
two
best
spellers
were
allowed
to
fight
it
out
with
gloves
my
own
method
and
it
worked
spell
they
spell
their
heads
off
to
get
a
chance
at
the
gloves
gee
how
i
hated
to
give
them
up
this
was
a
new
peter
a
boyish
individual
harmony
had
never
met
before
for
the
first
time
it
struck
her
that
peter
was
young
he
had
always
seemed
rather
old
solid
and
dependable
the
fault
of
his
elder
brother
attitude
to
her
no
doubt
she
was
suddenly
rather
shy
a
bit
aloof
peter
felt
the
change
and
thought
she
was
bored
he
talked
of
other
things
a
surprise
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
cold
lower
hallway
of
the
pension
schwarz
a
trunk
was
there
locked
and
roped
and
on
the
trunk
in
ulster
and
hat
sat
gates
olga
looking
rather
frightened
was
coming
down
with
a
she
put
down
the
bag
and
scuttled
up
the
staircase
like
a
scared
rabbit
the
little
doctor
was
grim
she
eyed
peter
and
harmony
with
an
impersonal
hostility
referable
to
her
humor
i
been
waiting
for
you
two
she
flung
at
them
i
had
a
terrific
row
upstairs
and
i
going
that
woman
a
devil
it
had
been
a
bad
day
for
harmony
and
this
new
development
after
everything
else
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
crisis
she
had
clung
at
first
out
of
sheer
loneliness
and
recently
out
of
affection
to
the
sharp
little
doctor
with
her
mannish
affectations
her
soft
and
womanly
heart
sit
down
anna
gates
moved
over
on
the
trunk
you
are
fagged
out
peter
will
you
stop
looking
murderous
and
listen
to
me
how
much
did
it
cost
the
three
of
us
to
live
in
this
abode
of
virtue
it
was
simple
addition
the
total
was
rather
appalling
i
thought
so
now
this
is
my
plan
it
may
not
be
conventional
but
it
will
be
respectable
enough
to
satisfy
anybody
and
it
will
be
cheaper
i
sure
of
that
we
are
all
going
out
to
the
of
maria
theresa
and
harmony
shall
keep
house
for
us
chapter
ix
it
was
the
middle
of
november
when
anna
gates
sitting
on
her
trunk
in
the
cold
entrance
hall
on
the
hirschengasse
flung
the
conversational
bomb
that
left
empty
three
rooms
in
the
pension
schwarz
found
harmony
back
and
fully
established
in
the
lodge
of
maria
theresa
on
the
street
of
seven
stars
back
but
with
a
difference
true
the
gate
still
swung
back
and
forward
on
rusty
hinges
obedient
to
every
whim
of
the
december
gales
but
the
casement
windows
in
the
salon
no
longer
creaked
or
admitted
drafts
thanks
to
peter
and
a
roll
of
rubber
the
grand
piano
which
had
been
scatchy
rented
extravagance
had
gone
never
to
return
and
in
its
corner
stood
a
battered
but
still
usable
upright
under
the
great
chandelier
sat
a
table
with
an
oil
lamp
and
evening
and
morning
the
stove
gleamed
warm
with
fire
on
the
table
by
the
lamp
were
the
combined
medical
books
of
peter
and
anna
gates
and
an
which
also
they
used
in
common
shabby
still
of
course
bare
almost
denuded
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
but
at
night
with
the
lamp
lighted
and
the
little
door
of
the
stove
open
and
perhaps
when
the
dishes
from
supper
had
been
washed
with
harmony
playing
softly
it
took
resolution
on
peter
part
to
put
on
his
overcoat
and
face
a
lecture
on
the
resection
of
a
rib
or
a
discussion
of
the
function
of
the
pituitary
body
the
new
arrangement
had
proved
itself
in
more
ways
than
one
not
only
greater
in
comfort
but
in
economy
food
was
amazingly
cheap
coal
which
had
cost
ninety
hellers
a
bucket
at
the
pension
schwarz
they
bought
in
quantity
and
could
afford
to
use
lavishly
oil
for
the
lamp
was
a
trifle
they
dined
on
venison
now
and
then
when
the
shop
across
boasted
a
deer
from
the
mountains
they
had
other
game
occasionally
when
peter
carrying
home
a
mysterious
package
would
make
them
guess
what
it
might
contain
always
on
such
occasions
harmony
guessed
rabbits
she
knew
how
to
cook
rabbits
and
some
of
the
other
game
worried
her
for
harmony
was
the
cook
it
had
taken
many
arguments
and
much
coaxing
to
make
peter
see
it
that
way
in
vain
harmony
argued
the
extravagance
of
rosa
now
married
to
the
soldier
from
salzburg
with
one
lung
or
the
tendency
of
the
delicatessen
seller
to
weigh
short
if
one
did
not
watch
him
peter
was
firm
it
was
gates
after
all
who
found
the
solution
do
be
too
obstinate
peter
she
admonished
him
the
child
needs
occupation
she
ca
practice
all
day
you
and
i
can
keep
up
the
financial
end
well
enough
reduced
as
it
is
let
her
keep
house
to
her
heart
content
that
can
be
her
contribution
to
the
general
and
that
eventually
was
the
way
it
settled
itself
not
without
demur
from
harmony
who
feared
her
part
was
too
small
and
who
irritated
anna
almost
to
a
frenzy
by
cleaning
the
apartment
from
end
to
end
to
make
certain
of
her
usefulness
a
curious
little
household
surely
one
that
made
the
wife
of
the
portier
shake
her
head
and
speak
much
beneath
her
breath
with
the
wife
of
the
brushmaker
about
the
americans
having
queer
ways
and
not
as
the
austrians
the
short
month
had
seen
a
change
in
all
of
them
peter
showed
it
least
of
all
perhaps
men
feel
physical
discomfort
less
keenly
than
women
and
peter
had
been
only
subconsciously
wretched
he
had
gained
a
pound
or
two
in
flesh
perhaps
and
he
was
unmistakably
tidier
anna
gates
was
growing
round
and
rosy
and
harmony
had
trimmed
her
a
hat
but
the
real
change
was
in
harmony
herself
the
girl
had
become
a
woman
who
knows
the
curious
psychology
by
which
such
changes
come
not
in
a
month
or
a
year
but
in
an
hour
a
breath
one
moment
harmony
was
a
shy
tender
young
creature
all
emotion
quivering
at
a
word
aloof
at
a
glance
prone
to
occasional
introspection
and
mysterious
daydreams
the
next
she
was
a
young
woman
tender
but
not
shyly
so
incredibly
poised
almost
formidably
dignified
on
occasion
but
with
little
girlish
lapses
into
frolic
and
high
spirits
the
transition
moment
with
harmony
came
about
in
this
wise
they
had
been
settled
for
three
weeks
the
odor
of
stewing
cabbages
at
the
pension
schwarz
had
retired
into
the
oblivion
of
lost
scents
to
be
recalled
along
with
its
accompanying
memory
of
discomfort
with
every
odor
of
stewing
cabbages
for
years
to
come
at
the
hospital
jimmy
had
had
a
bad
week
again
it
had
been
an
anxious
time
for
all
of
them
in
vain
the
sentry
had
stopped
outside
the
third
window
and
smiled
and
nodded
through
it
in
vain
when
the
street
was
deserted
and
there
was
none
to
notice
he
went
through
a
bit
of
the
manual
of
arms
on
the
pavement
outside
ending
by
setting
his
gun
down
with
a
martial
and
ringing
clang
in
vain
had
peter
exhausted
himself
in
literary
efforts
climbing
peaks
taking
through
such
a
switzerland
as
never
was
shooting
animals
of
various
sorts
but
all
hornless
as
he
carefully
emphasized
and
now
jimmy
was
better
again
he
was
propped
up
in
bed
and
with
the
aid
of
nurse
elisabet
he
had
cut
out
a
paper
sentry
and
set
it
in
the
barred
window
the
real
sentry
had
been
very
much
astonished
he
had
almost
fallen
over
backward
on
recovering
he
went
entirely
through
the
manual
of
arms
and
was
almost
seen
by
an
it
was
all
most
exciting
harmony
had
been
to
see
jimmy
on
the
day
in
question
she
had
taken
him
some
gelatin
not
without
apprehension
it
being
her
first
essay
in
jelly
and
jimmy
being
frank
with
the
candor
of
childhood
the
jelly
had
been
a
great
success
it
was
when
she
was
about
to
go
that
jimmy
broached
a
matter
very
near
his
heart
the
horns
have
come
have
they
he
asked
wistfully
no
not
do
you
think
he
got
my
letter
about
them
he
answered
it
did
he
jimmy
drew
a
long
breath
it
very
funny
he
mostly
so
quick
if
i
had
the
horns
sister
elisabet
would
tie
them
there
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
i
could
pretend
i
was
harmony
had
a
great
piece
of
luck
that
day
as
she
went
home
she
saw
hanging
in
front
of
the
shop
next
to
the
delicatessen
store
a
fresh
deer
and
this
time
it
was
a
stag
like
the
others
it
hung
head
down
and
as
it
swayed
on
its
hook
its
great
antlers
tapped
against
the
shop
door
as
if
mutely
begging
admission
she
could
not
buy
the
antlers
in
vain
she
pleaded
explained
implored
harmony
enlisted
the
portier
and
took
him
across
with
her
the
seller
was
obdurate
he
would
sell
the
deer
entire
or
he
would
mount
head
and
antlers
for
his
wife
cousin
in
galicia
as
a
christmas
gift
harmony
went
back
to
the
lodge
and
climbed
the
stairs
she
was
profoundly
depressed
even
the
discovery
that
peter
had
come
home
early
and
was
building
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
brought
only
a
fleeting
smile
anna
was
not
yet
home
peter
built
the
fire
the
winter
dusk
was
falling
and
harmony
made
a
movement
to
light
the
candles
peter
stopped
her
ca
we
have
the
firelight
for
a
little
while
you
are
always
beautiful
but
you
are
lovely
in
the
firelight
that
is
because
you
like
me
we
always
think
our
friends
are
i
am
fond
of
anna
but
i
have
never
thought
her
the
kitchen
was
small
harmony
rolling
up
her
sleeves
by
the
table
and
peter
before
the
stove
were
very
close
together
the
dusk
was
fast
fading
into
darkness
to
this
tiny
room
at
the
back
of
the
old
house
few
street
sounds
penetrated
round
them
shutting
them
off
together
from
the
world
of
shops
with
lighted
windows
rumbling
busses
and
hurrying
humanity
lay
the
old
lodge
with
its
dingy
gardens
its
whitewashed
halls
its
dark
and
twisting
staircases
peter
had
been
very
careful
he
had
cultivated
a
comradely
manner
with
the
girl
that
had
kept
her
entirely
at
her
ease
with
him
but
it
had
been
growing
increasingly
hard
he
was
only
human
after
all
and
he
was
very
comfortable
love
healthy
human
love
thrives
on
physical
ease
indigestion
is
a
greater
foe
to
it
than
poverty
great
love
songs
are
written
not
by
poets
starving
in
hall
bedrooms
with
insistent
hunger
gnawing
and
undermining
all
that
is
of
the
spirit
but
by
gentlemen
who
sing
out
of
an
overflowing
of
content
and
wide
fellowship
and
who
write
no
doubt
just
after
dinner
love
being
a
hunger
does
not
thrive
on
hunger
thus
peter
he
had
never
found
women
essential
being
occupied
in
the
struggle
for
other
essentials
women
had
had
little
part
in
his
busy
life
once
or
twice
he
had
seen
visions
dreamed
dreams
to
waken
himself
savagely
to
the
fact
that
not
for
many
years
could
he
afford
the
luxury
of
tender
eyes
looking
up
into
his
of
soft
arms
about
his
neck
so
he
had
kept
away
from
women
with
almost
ferocious
determination
and
now
he
drew
a
chair
before
the
stove
and
sat
down
standing
or
sitting
he
was
much
too
large
for
the
kitchen
he
sat
in
the
chair
with
his
hands
hanging
fingers
interlaced
between
his
knees
the
firelight
glowed
over
his
strong
rather
irregular
features
harmony
knife
poised
over
the
evening
potatoes
looked
at
him
i
think
you
are
sad
depressed
a
bit
that
it
is
money
again
it
was
generally
money
with
any
of
the
three
and
only
the
week
before
peter
had
found
an
error
in
his
bank
balance
which
meant
that
he
was
a
hundred
kronen
or
so
poorer
than
he
had
thought
this
discovery
had
been
very
upsetting
not
more
than
usual
do
mind
me
i
probably
end
in
a
roaring
bad
temper
and
smash
something
my
moody
spells
often
break
up
that
way
harmony
put
down
the
and
going
over
to
where
he
sat
rested
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
peter
drew
away
from
it
i
have
hurt
you
in
some
way
of
course
could
could
you
talk
about
whatever
it
is
that
helps
you
would
you
have
quarreled
with
anna
harmony
asked
real
concern
in
her
voice
no
good
lord
harmony
do
ask
me
what
wrong
i
do
know
he
got
up
almost
violently
and
set
the
little
chair
back
against
the
wall
hurt
and
astonished
harmony
went
back
to
the
table
the
kitchen
was
entirely
dark
save
for
the
firelight
which
gleamed
on
the
bare
floor
and
the
red
legs
of
the
table
she
was
fumbling
with
a
match
and
the
candle
when
she
realized
that
peter
was
just
behind
her
very
close
dearest
he
said
huskily
the
next
moment
he
had
caught
her
to
him
was
kissing
her
lips
her
hair
harmony
heart
beat
wildly
there
was
no
use
struggling
against
him
the
gates
of
his
were
down
all
his
loneliness
his
starved
senses
rushed
forth
in
tardy
assertion
after
a
moment
peter
kissed
her
eyelids
very
gently
and
let
her
go
harmony
was
trembling
but
with
shock
and
alarm
only
the
storm
that
had
torn
him
root
and
branch
from
his
firm
ground
of
left
her
only
shaken
he
was
still
very
close
to
her
she
could
hear
him
breathing
he
did
not
attempt
to
speak
with
every
atom
of
strength
that
was
left
in
him
he
was
fighting
a
mad
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
again
and
keep
her
there
that
was
the
moment
when
harmony
became
a
woman
she
lighted
the
candle
with
the
match
she
still
held
then
she
turned
and
faced
him
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
for
you
and
me
peter
she
said
quietly
why
not
there
is
any
question
about
he
was
still
reckless
even
argumentative
the
crying
need
of
her
still
obsessed
him
why
not
why
should
i
not
take
you
in
my
arms
if
there
is
a
moment
of
happiness
to
be
had
in
this
grind
of
work
and
loneliness
it
has
not
made
me
perhaps
nothing
else
she
could
have
said
would
have
been
so
effectual
love
demands
reciprocation
he
could
read
no
passion
in
her
voice
he
knew
then
that
he
had
left
her
unstirred
he
dropped
his
outstretched
arms
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
do
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
it
the
banging
of
a
door
far
off
told
them
that
anna
gates
had
arrived
and
was
taking
off
her
galoshes
in
the
entry
peter
drew
a
long
breath
and
after
his
habit
shook
himself
very
well
we
not
talk
of
it
but
for
heaven
sake
harmony
avoid
me
i
not
a
cad
i
let
you
there
was
only
time
for
a
glance
of
understanding
between
them
of
promise
from
peter
of
acceptance
from
the
girl
when
anna
gates
entered
the
kitchen
she
found
harmony
peeling
potatoes
and
peter
filling
up
an
already
overfed
stove
that
night
during
that
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
when
the
thrifty
city
fathers
of
the
old
town
had
shut
off
the
street
lights
because
two
hours
later
the
sun
would
rise
and
furnish
light
that
cost
the
taxpayers
nothing
the
portier
wife
awakened
the
room
was
very
silent
too
silent
on
those
rare
occasions
when
the
portier
wife
awakened
in
the
night
and
heard
the
twin
clocks
of
the
votivkirche
strike
three
and
listened
perhaps
while
the
delicatessen
seller
ambled
home
from
the
schubert
society
singing
beerily
as
he
ambled
she
was
wont
to
hear
from
the
bed
beside
hers
the
rhythmic
respiration
that
told
her
how
safe
from
schubert
societies
and
such
like
evils
was
her
lord
there
was
no
sound
at
all
the
portier
wife
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
reached
over
owing
to
the
width
of
the
table
that
stood
between
the
beds
and
to
a
sweeping
that
day
which
had
left
the
beds
far
apart
she
met
nothing
but
empty
air
words
had
small
effect
on
the
portier
who
slept
fathoms
deep
in
unconsciousness
also
she
did
not
wish
to
get
up
the
floor
was
cold
and
a
wind
blowing
could
she
not
hear
it
and
the
creaking
of
the
deer
across
the
street
as
it
swung
on
its
hook
the
wife
of
the
portier
was
a
person
of
resource
she
took
the
iron
candlestick
from
the
table
and
flung
it
into
the
darkness
at
the
portier
pillow
no
startled
yell
followed
suspicion
thus
confirmed
the
portier
wife
forgot
the
cold
floor
and
the
wind
and
barefoot
felt
her
way
into
the
hall
suspicion
was
doubly
confirmed
the
chain
was
off
the
door
it
even
stood
open
an
inch
or
two
armed
with
a
second
candlestick
she
stationed
herself
inside
the
door
and
waited
the
stone
floor
was
icy
but
the
fury
of
a
woman
scorned
kept
her
warm
the
votivkirche
struck
one
two
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
candlestick
in
her
hand
changed
from
iron
to
ice
from
ice
to
fire
still
the
portier
had
not
come
back
and
the
door
chain
swung
in
the
wind
at
four
she
retired
to
the
bedroom
again
indignation
had
changed
to
fear
coupled
with
sneezing
surely
even
the
schubert
society
what
was
that
from
the
portier
bed
was
coming
a
rhythmic
respiration
she
roused
him
standing
over
him
with
the
iron
candlestick
now
lighted
and
gazing
at
him
with
eyes
in
which
alarm
struggled
with
suspicion
thou
hast
been
out
of
thy
bed
but
no
an
hour
since
the
bed
was
thou
the
chain
is
off
the
let
it
remain
so
and
sleep
what
have
we
to
steal
or
the
americans
above
sleep
and
keep
he
yawned
and
was
instantly
asleep
again
the
portier
wife
crawled
into
her
bed
and
warmed
her
aching
feet
under
the
crimson
feather
comfort
but
her
soul
was
shaken
the
devil
had
been
known
to
come
at
night
and
take
innocent
ones
out
to
do
his
evil
the
innocent
ones
knew
it
not
but
it
might
be
told
by
the
soles
of
the
feet
which
were
always
soiled
at
dawn
the
portier
wife
cautiously
uncovered
the
soles
of
her
sleeping
lord
feet
and
fell
back
gasping
they
were
quite
black
as
of
one
who
had
tramped
in
garden
mould
early
the
next
morning
harmony
after
a
restless
night
opened
the
door
from
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
into
the
hall
and
set
out
a
pitcher
for
the
milk
on
the
floor
just
outside
lay
the
antlers
from
the
deer
across
the
street
tied
to
them
was
a
bit
of
paper
and
on
it
was
written
the
one
word
still
chapter
x
in
looking
back
after
a
catastrophe
it
is
easy
to
trace
the
steps
by
which
the
inevitable
advanced
destiny
marches
not
by
great
leaps
but
with
a
thousand
small
and
painful
steps
and
here
and
there
it
leaves
its
mark
a
footprint
on
a
naked
soul
we
trace
a
life
by
its
scars
as
a
tree
by
its
rings
anna
gates
was
not
the
best
possible
companion
for
harmony
and
this
with
every
allowance
for
her
real
kindliness
her
genuine
affection
for
the
girl
life
had
destroyed
her
illusions
and
it
was
of
illusions
that
harmony
veil
had
been
woven
to
anna
gates
worn
with
a
thousand
sleepless
nights
a
thousand
thankless
days
withered
before
her
time
with
the
struggling
routine
of
medical
practice
sapped
with
endless
calls
for
sympathy
and
aid
existence
ceased
to
be
spiritual
and
became
physiological
life
and
birth
and
death
had
lost
their
mysteries
the
veil
was
rent
to
fit
this
existence
of
hers
she
had
built
herself
a
curious
creed
a
philosophy
of
individualism
from
behind
which
she
flung
strange
bombshells
of
theories
shafts
of
distorted
moralities
personal
liberties
irresponsibilities
a
supreme
scorn
for
modern
law
and
the
prophets
nature
she
claimed
was
her
law
and
her
prophet
in
her
virginal
life
her
theories
had
wrought
no
mischief
temptation
had
been
lacking
to
exploit
them
and
even
in
the
event
of
the
opportunity
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
would
have
had
the
strength
of
her
convictions
men

gates
was
largely
masculine
women
being
literal
are
apt
to
absorb
dangerous
doctrine
and
put
it
to
the
test
when
it
is
false
doctrine
they
discover

too
late
harmony
was
now
a
woman
anna
would
have
cut
off
her
hand
sooner
than
have
brought
the
girl
to
harm
but
she
loved
to
generalize
it
amused
her
to
see
harmony
eyes
widen
with
horror
at
one
of
her
radical
beliefs
nothing
pleased
her
more
than
to
pit
her
individualism
against
the
girl
rigid
and
conventional
morality
and
down
her
by
some
apparently
unanswerable
argument
on
the
day
after
the
incident
in
the
kitchen
such
an
argument
took
place
hardly
an
argument
for
harmony
knew
nothing
of
mental
fencing
anna
had
taken
a
heavy
cold
and
remained
at
home
harmony
had
been
practicing
and
at
the
end
she
played
a
little
winter
song
by
some
modern
composer
it
breathed
all
the
purity
of
a
white
winter
day
it
was
as
chaste
as
ice
and
as
cold
and
yet
throughout
was
the
thought
of
green
things
hiding
beneath
the
snow
and
the
hope
of
spring
harmony
having
finished
voiced
some
such
feeling
she
was
rather
ashamed
of
her
thought
it
seems
that
way
to
me
she
finished
apologetically
it
sounds
rather
silly
i
always
think
i
can
tell
the
sort
of
person
who
composes
certain
and
this
gentleman
who
writes
of
winter
i
think
he
is
very
reserved
and
that
he
has
never
loved
any
indeed
when
there
is
any
love
in
music
any
heart
one
always
feels
it
exactly
as
in
books
the
difference
between
a
love
story
and
and
a
dictionary
you
always
laugh
harmony
complained
that
better
than
weeping
when
i
think
of
the
rotten
way
things
go
in
this
world
i
want
to
weep
i
do
find
it
a
bad
world
of
course
there
are
bad
people
but
there
are
good
where
peter
and
you
and
i
i
there
are
plenty
of
good
what
do
you
call
a
good
man
harmony
hesitated
then
went
on
bravely
honorable
anna
smiled
my
dear
child
she
said
you
substitute
the
code
of
a
gentleman
for
the
mosaic
law
of
course
your
good
man
is
a
monogamist
harmony
nodded
puzzled
eyes
on
anna
then
there
are
no
people
in
the
polygamous
countries
i
suppose
when
there
were
twelve
women
to
every
man
a
man
took
a
dozen
wives
in
our
part
of
the
globe
there
is
one
woman
and
a
fifth
over
for
every
man
each
man
gets
one
woman
and
for
every
five
couples
there
is
a
derelict
like
myself
anna
amazing
frankness
about
herself
often
confused
harmony
her
resentment
at
her
single
condition
because
it
left
her
childless
brought
forth
theories
that
shocked
and
alarmed
the
girl
in
the
atmosphere
in
which
harmony
had
been
reared
single
women
were
always
presumed
to
be
thus
by
choice
and
to
regard
with
certain
tolerance
those
weaker
sisters
who
had
married
anna
on
the
contrary
was
frankly
a
derelict
frankly
regretted
her
maiden
condition
and
railed
with
bitterness
against
her
enforced
childlessness
the
near
approach
of
christmas
had
for
years
found
her
morose
and
resentful
there
are
here
and
there
such
women
essentially
mothers
but
not
necessarily
wives
their
sole
passion
that
of
maternity
anna
argumentative
and
reckless
talked
on
she
tore
away
in
her
resentment
every
theory
of
existence
the
girl
had
ever
known
and
offered
her
instead
an
incredible
liberty
in
the
name
of
the
freedom
of
the
individual
harmony
found
all
her
foundations
of
living
shaken
and
though
refusing
to
accept
anna
theories
found
her
faith
in
her
own
weakened
she
sat
back
pale
and
silent
listening
while
anna
built
up
out
of
her
discontent
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
with
liberty
written
high
in
its
firmament
when
her
reckless
mood
had
passed
anna
was
regretful
enough
at
the
girl
stricken
face
i
a
fool
she
said
contritely
if
peter
had
been
here
he
have
throttled
me
i
deserve
it
i
a
theorist
pure
and
simple
and
theorists
are
the
anarchists
of
society
there
only
one
comfort
about
us
we
never
live
up
to
our
convictions
now
forget
all
this
rot
been
peter
brought
up
the
mail
that
afternoon
a
christmas
card
or
two
for
anna
depressingly
early
and
a
letter
from
the
big
soprano
for
harmony
from
new
york
the
big
soprano
was
very
glad
to
be
back
and
spent
two
pages
over
her
chances
for
concert
work
i
could
have
done
as
well
had
i
stayed
at
home
if
i
had
had
the
money
they
wanted
to
go
to
geneva
and
sing
it
would
have
helped
a
lot
i
could
have
said
i
sung
in
opera
in
europe
and
at
least
have
had
a
hearing
at
the
met
but
i
did
and
i
back
at
the
church
again
and
glad
to
get
my
old
salary
if
it
at
all
possible
stay
until
the
master
has
presented
you
in
a
concert
he
quite
right
you
a
chance
unless
he
does
and
now
i
quit
grumbling
scatchy
met
her
henry
at
the
dock
and
looked
quite
lovely
flushed
with
excitement
and
having
been
up
since
dawn
curling
her
hair
he
was
rather
a
disappointment
small
and
blond
with
light
blue
eyes
and
almost
dapper
but
oh
my
dear
i
would
care
how
pale
a
man
eyes
were
if
he
looked
at
me
the
way
henry
looked
at
her
they
asked
me
to
luncheon
with
them
but
i
knew
they
wanted
to
be
alone
together
and
so
i
ate
a
bite
or
two
all
i
could
swallow
for
the
lump
in
my
throat
by
myself
i
was
homesick
enough
in
old
wien
but
i
am
just
as
homesick
now
that
i
am
here
for
we
are
really
homesick
only
for
people
not
places
and
no
one
really
cared
whether
i
came
back
or
peter
had
been
miserable
all
day
not
with
regret
for
the
day
before
but
with
fear
what
if
harmony
should
decide
that
the
situation
was
unpleasant
and
decide
to
leave
what
if
a
reckless
impulse
recklessly
carried
out
were
to
break
up
an
arrangement
that
had
made
a
green
oasis
of
happiness
and
content
for
all
of
them
in
the
desert
of
their
common
despair
if
he
had
only
let
her
go
and
apologized
but
no
he
had
had
to
argue
to
justify
himself
to
make
an
idiot
of
himself
generally
he
almost
groaned
aloud
as
he
opened
the
gate
end
crossed
the
wintry
garden
he
need
not
have
feared
harmony
had
taken
him
entirely
at
his
word
i
am
not
a
beast
i
let
you
alone
he
had
said
she
had
had
a
bad
night
as
nights
go
she
had
gone
through
the
painful
introspection
which
in
a
thoroughly
good
girl
always
follows
such
an
outburst
as
peter
had
she
said
or
done
anything
to
make
him
think
surely
she
had
not
had
she
been
wrong
about
peter
after
all
surely
not
again
while
the
portier
wife
waked
as
may
happen
by
an
unaccustomed
silence
was
standing
guard
in
the
hall
below
iron
candlestick
in
hand
harmony
having
read
the
litany
through
in
the
not
particularly
religious
hope
of
getting
to
sleep
was
dreaming
placidly
it
was
peter
who
tossed
and
turned
almost
all
night
truly
there
had
been
little
sleep
that
night
in
the
old
of
maria
theresa
peter
still
not
quite
at
ease
that
evening
kept
out
of
the
kitchen
while
supper
was
preparing
anna
radical
theories
forgotten
and
wearing
a
knitted
shawl
against
drafts
was
making
a
salad
and
harmony
all
anxiety
and
flushed
with
heat
was
broiling
a
steak
steak
was
an
extravagance
to
be
cooked
with
clear
hot
coals
and
prayer
peter
she
called
you
may
set
the
table
and
try
to
lay
the
cloth
peter
exiled
in
the
salon
came
joyously
obviously
the
wretched
business
of
yesterday
was
forgiven
he
came
to
the
door
pipe
in
mouth
suppose
i
refuse
he
questioned
you
you
have
been
very
friendly
with
me
i
do
quarrel
you
children
cried
anna
beating
eggs
vigorously
harmony
is
always
friendly
too
friendly
the
portier
loves
i
sure
i
said
to
you
usually
say
peter
and
i
did
not
you
did
then
thank
his
steady
eyes
met
hers
in
them
there
was
a
renewal
of
his
promise
abasement
regret
harmony
met
him
with
forgiveness
and
restoration
sometimes
said
peter
humbly
when
i
am
in
very
great
favor
you
say
peter

chapter
xi
the
affairs
of
young
stewart
and
marie
jedlicka
were
not
moving
smoothly
having
rented
their
apartment
to
the
boyers
and
through
marie
frugality
and
the
extra
month
wages
at
christmas
which
was
marie
annual
perquisite
being
temporarily
in
funds
the
sky
seemed
clear
enough
and
walter
stewart
started
on
his
holiday
with
a
comfortable
sense
of
financial
security
boyer
shown
over
the
flat
by
stewart
during
marie
temporary
exile
in
the
apartment
across
the
hall
was
captivated
by
the
comfort
of
the
little
suite
and
by
its
order
her
housewifely
mind
restless
with
long
inactivity
in
a
pension
seized
on
the
bright
pans
of
kitchen
and
the
promise
of
the
stove
she
disapproved
of
stewart
having
heard
strange
stories
of
him
but
there
was
nothing
bacchanal
or
suspicious
about
this
orderly
establishment
boyer
was
a
placid
motherly
looking
woman
torn
from
her
church
and
her
card
club
her
grown
children
her
household
gods
of
thirty
years
accumulation
that
frank
might
catch
up
with
his
profession
she
had
explained
it
rather
tremulously
at
home
father
wants
to
go
she
said
you
children
are
big
enough
now
to
be
left
he
always
wanted
to
do
it
but
we
could
go
while
you
were
but
mother
expostulated
the
oldest
girl
when
you
are
so
afraid
of
the
ocean
and
a
year
what
is
to
be
will
be
she
had
replied
if
i
going
to
be
drowned
i
be
drowned
whether
it
in
the
sea
or
in
a
bathtub
and
i
not
let
father
go
fatalism
being
their
mother
last
argument
and
always
final
the
children
gave
up
they
let
her
go
more
they
prepared
for
her
so
elaborate
a
wardrobe
that
the
poor
soul
had
had
no
excuse
to
purchase
anything
abroad
she
had
gone
through
paris
looking
straight
ahead
lest
her
eyes
lead
her
into
the
temptation
of
the
shops
in
vienna
she
wore
her
outfit
with
determination
vaguely
conscious
that
the
women
about
her
had
more
style
were
different
she
priced
unsuitable
garments
wistfully
and
went
home
to
her
trunks
full
of
best
materials
that
would
never
wear
out
the
children
knowing
her
had
bought
the
best
to
this
couple
then
stewart
had
rented
his
apartment
it
is
hard
to
say
by
what
psychology
he
found
their
respectability
so
satisfactory
it
was
as
though
his
own
status
gained
by
it
he
had
much
the
same
feeling
about
the
order
and
decency
with
which
marie
managed
the
apartment
as
if
irregularity
were
thus
regularized
marie
had
met
him
once
for
a
walk
along
the
graben
she
had
worn
an
experimental
touch
of
rouge
under
a
veil
and
fine
lines
were
drawn
under
her
blue
eyes
darkening
them
she
had
looked
very
pretty
rather
frightened
stewart
had
sent
her
home
and
had
sulked
for
an
entire
evening
so
curious
a
thing
is
the
mind
masculine
such
an
order
of
disorder
so
conventional
its
defiance
of
convention
stewart
breaking
the
law
and
trying
to
keep
the
letter
on
the
day
they
left
for
semmering
marie
was
up
at
dawn
there
was
much
to
do
the
house
must
be
left
clean
and
shining
there
must
be
no
feminine
gewgaws
to
reveal
to
the
frau
doktor
that
it
was
not
a
purely
masculine
establishment
at
the
last
moment
so
late
that
it
sent
her
heart
into
her
mouth
she
happened
on
the
box
of
rouge
hidden
from
stewart
watchful
eyes
she
gave
it
to
the
milk
girl
finally
she
folded
her
meager
wardrobe
and
placed
it
in
the
herr
doktor
american
trunk
a
marvel
that
trunk
so
firm
so
heavy
bound
with
iron
and
with
her
own
clothing
she
packed
stewart
the
he
had
worn
once
to
the
embassy
a
hat
that
folded
strange
american
shoes
and
books
always
books
the
herr
doktor
would
study
at
semmering
when
all
was
in
readiness
and
stewart
was
taking
a
final
survey
marie
ran
downstairs
and
summoned
a
cab
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
ask
him
to
do
it
marie
small
life
was
one
of
service
and
besides
there
was
an
element
in
their
relationship
that
no
one
but
marie
suspected
and
that
she
hid
even
from
herself
she
was
very
much
in
love
with
this
indifferent
american
this
captious
temporary
god
of
her
domestic
altar
such
a
contingency
had
never
occurred
to
stewart
but
peter
smoking
gravely
in
the
little
apartment
had
more
than
once
caught
a
look
in
marie
eyes
as
she
turned
them
on
the
other
man
and
had
surmised
it
it
made
him
uncomfortable
when
the
train
was
well
under
way
however
and
he
found
no
disturbing
element
among
the
three
others
in
the
compartment
stewart
relaxed
semmering
was
a
favorite
resort
with
the
american
colony
but
not
until
later
in
the
winter
in
december
there
were
rains
in
the
mountains
and
clouds
that
invested
some
of
the
chalets
in
constant
fog
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
january
that
the
little
mountain
train
became
crowded
with
tourists
knickerbockered
men
with
knapsacks
and
jaunty
feathers
in
their
soft
hats
boys
carrying
ski
women
with
alpine
cloaks
and
sticks
marie
was
childishly
happy
it
was
the
first
real
vacation
of
her
life
and
more
than
that
she
was
going
to
semmering
in
the
very
shadow
of
the
raxalpe
the
beloved
mountain
of
the
viennese
marie
had
seen
the
rax
all
her
life
as
it
towered
thirty
miles
or
so
away
above
the
plain
on
peaceful
sundays
having
climbed
the
cog
railroad
she
had
seen
its
white
head
turn
rosy
in
the
setting
sun
and
once
when
a
german
tourist
from
munich
had
handed
her
his
fieldglass
she
had
even
made
out
some
of
the
crosses
that
showed
where
travelers
had
met
their
deaths
now
she
would
be
very
close
if
the
weather
were
good
she
might
even
say
a
prayer
in
the
chapel
on
its
crest
for
the
souls
of
those
who
had
died
it
was
of
a
marvel
truly
so
far
may
one
go
when
one
has
money
and
leisure
the
small
railway
carriages
bumped
and
rattled
up
the
mountain
sides
always
rising
always
winding
there
were
moments
when
the
track
held
to
the
cliffs
only
by
gigantic
fingers
of
steel
while
far
below
were
peaceful
valleys
and
houses
and
churches
with
gilded
spires
there
were
vistas
of
and
avalanche
shed
and
always
there
were
tunnels
marie
so
wise
in
some
things
was
a
child
in
others
she
slid
close
to
stewart
in
the
darkness
and
touched
him
for
comfort
it
is
so
dark
she
apologized
and
it
frightens
me
the
mountain
heart
in
your
america
have
you
so
great
mountains
stewart
patted
her
hand
a
patronizing
touch
that
sent
her
blood
racing
much
larger
he
said
magnificently
i
have
seen
a
hill
in
europe
i
exchange
for
the
rockies
and
when
we
cross
the
mountains
there
we
use
railway
coaches
these
toy
railroads
are
a
joke
at
home
we
use
as
really
i
should
like
to
see
so
should
the
conversation
was
taking
a
dangerous
trend
mention
of
america
was
apt
to
put
the
herr
doktor
in
a
bad
humor
or
to
depress
him
which
was
even
worse
marie
her
hand
still
on
his
arm
and
not
repulsed
became
silent
at
a
small
way
station
the
three
germans
in
the
compartment
left
the
train
stewart
lowering
a
window
bought
from
a
boy
on
the
platform
beer
and
sausages
and
a
bag
of
pretzels
as
the
train
resumed
its
clanking
progress
they
ate
luncheon
drinking
the
beer
from
the
bottles
and
slicing
the
sausage
with
a
penknife
it
was
a
joyous
trip
a
day
in
the
girl
rather
sordid
if
not
uneventful
life
the
herr
doktor
was
pleased
with
her
he
liked
her
hat
and
when
she
flushed
with
pleasure
demanded
proof
that
she
was
not
rouged
proof
was
forthcoming
she
rubbed
her
cheeks
vigorously
with
a
handkerchief
and
produced
in
triumph
its
unreddened
purity
thou
suspicious
one
she
pouted
i
must
take
off
the
skin
to
assure
thee
when
the
herr
doktor
says
no
rouge
i
use
you
a
good
he
stooped
over
and
kissed
one
scarlet
cheek
and
then
being
very
comfortable
and
the
beer
having
made
him
drowsy
he
put
his
head
in
her
lap
and
slept
when
he
awakened
they
were
still
higher
the
towered
above
and
the
valleys
were
dizzying
semmering
was
getting
near
they
were
frequently
in
darkness
and
between
the
tunnels
were
long
lines
of
granite
avalanche
sheds
the
little
passage
of
the
car
was
full
of
tourists
looking
down
we
are
very
close
i
am
sure
an
american
girl
was
saying
just
outside
the
doorway
see
is
that
the
kurhaus
there
it
is
lost
the
tourists
in
the
passage
were
americans
and
the
girl
who
had
spoken
was
young
and
attractive
stewart
noticed
them
for
the
first
time
and
moved
to
a
more
decorous
distance
from
marie
marie
jedlicka
took
her
cue
and
lapsed
into
silence
but
her
thoughts
were
busy
perhaps
this
girl
was
going
to
semmering
also
and
the
herr
doktor
would
meet
her
but
that
was
foolish
there
were
other
resorts
besides
semmering
and
in
the
little
villa
to
which
they
went
there
would
be
no
americans
it
was
childish
to
worry
about
a
girl
whose
back
and
profile
only
she
had
seen
also
profiles
were
deceptive
there
was
the
matter
of
the
ears
marie
ears
were
small
and
set
close
to
her
head
if
the
american
fraulein
ears
stuck
out
or
her
face
were
only
short
and
wide
but
no
the
american
fraulein
turned
and
glanced
once
swiftly
into
the
compartment
she
was
quite
lovely
stewart
thought
so
too
he
got
up
with
a
great
show
of
stretching
and
yawning
and
lounged
into
the
passage
he
did
not
speak
to
the
girl
marie
noted
that
with
some
comfort
but
shortly
after
she
saw
him
conversing
easily
with
a
male
member
of
the
party
her
heart
sank
again
life
was
moving
very
fast
for
marie
jedlicka
that
afternoon
on
the
train
stewart
was
duly
presented
to
the
party
of
americans
and
offered
his
own
cards
bowing
from
the
waist
and
clicking
his
heels
together
a
german
custom
he
had
picked
up
the
girl
was
impressed
marie
saw
that
when
they
drew
into
the
station
at
semmering
stewart
helped
the
american
party
off
first
and
then
came
back
for
marie
less
keen
eyes
than
the
little
austrian
would
have
seen
his
nervous
anxiety
to
escape
attention
once
they
were
out
of
the
train
and
moving
toward
the
gate
of
the
station
he
stopped
to
light
a
cigarette
he
put
down
the
and
picked
it
up
again
as
though
it
weighed
heavily
whereas
it
was
both
small
and
light
he
loitered
through
the
gate
and
paused
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
gateman
the
result
was
of
course
that
the
americans
were
in
a
sleigh
and
well
up
the
mountainside
before
stewart
and
marie
were
seated
side
by
side
in
a
sledge
their
luggage
about
them
a
robe
over
their
knees
and
a
noisy
driver
high
above
them
on
the
stewart
spoke
to
her
then
the
first
time
for
half
an
hour
marie
found
some
comfort
the
villas
at
semmering
were
scattered
wide
over
the
mountain
breast
set
in
dense
clumps
of
evergreens
hidden
from
the
roads
and
from
each
other
by
trees
and
shrubbery
separated
by
valleys
one
might
live
in
one
part
of
semmering
for
a
month
and
never
suspect
the
existence
of
other
parts
or
wander
over
steep
roads
and
paths
for
days
and
never
pass
twice
over
the
same
one
the
herr
doktor
might
not
see
the
american
girl
again
and
if
he
did
did
he
not
see
american
girls
wherever
he
went
the
sleigh
climbed
on
it
seemed
they
would
never
stop
climbing
below
in
the
valley
twilight
already
reigned
a
twilight
of
blue
shadows
of
cows
with
bells
wandering
home
over
frosty
fields
of
houses
with
dark
faces
that
opened
an
eye
of
lamplight
as
one
looked
across
the
valley
and
far
above
marie
pointed
without
words
her
small
heart
was
very
full
greater
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
it
steeper
more
beautiful
more
deadly
and
crowned
with
its
sunset
hue
of
rose
was
the
rax
even
stewart
lost
his
look
of
irritation
as
he
gazed
with
her
he
reached
over
and
covered
both
her
hands
with
his
large
one
under
the
robe
the
sleigh
climbed
steadily
marie
jedlicka
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
leaned
back
and
watched
the
mountain
its
crown
faded
from
rose
to
gold
from
gold
to
purple
with
a
thread
of
black
there
was
a
shadow
on
the
side
that
looked
like
a
cross
marie
stopped
the
sleigh
at
a
wayside
shrine
and
getting
out
knelt
to
say
a
prayer
for
the
travelers
who
had
died
on
the
rax
they
had
taken
a
room
at
a
small
villa
where
board
was
cheap
and
where
the
guests
were
usually
germans
of
the
thriftier
sort
from
bavaria
both
the
season
and
the
modest
character
of
the
establishment
promised
them
quiet
and
seclusion
to
marie
the
house
seemed
the
epitome
of
elegance
even
luxury
it
clung
to
a
steep
hillside
their
room
on
the
third
floor
looked
out
from
the
back
of
the
building
over
the
valley
which
fell
away
almost
sheer
from
beneath
their
windows
a
tiny
balcony
outside
with
access
to
it
by
a
door
from
the
bedroom
looked
far
down
on
the
tops
of
tall
pines
it
made
marie
dizzy
she
was
cheerful
again
and
busy
the
american
trunk
was
to
be
unpacked
and
the
herr
doktor
things
put
away
his
shoes
in
rows
as
he
liked
them
and
his
shaving
materials
laid
out
on
the
washstand
then
there
was
a
new
dress
to
put
on
that
she
might
do
him
credit
at
supper
stewart
bad
humor
had
returned
he
complained
of
the
room
and
the
draft
under
the
balcony
door
the
light
was
wrong
for
shaving
but
the
truth
came
out
at
last
and
found
marie
not
unprepared
the
fact
is
he
said
i
not
going
to
eat
with
you
dear
i
going
to
the
with
the
americans
yes
i
know
a
chap
who
went
to
college
with
the
brother
with
the
young
man
you
marie
glanced
down
at
her
gala
toilet
then
she
began
slowly
to
take
off
the
dress
reaching
behind
her
for
a
hook
he
had
just
fastened
and
fighting
back
tears
as
she
struggled
with
it
now
remember
marie
i
will
have
no
i
am
not
why
should
you
change
your
clothes
because
the
dress
was
for
you
if
you
are
not
here
i
do
not
wish
to
wear
stewart
went
out
in
a
bad
humor
which
left
him
before
he
had
walked
for
five
minutes
in
the
clear
mountain
air
at
the
hotel
he
found
the
party
waiting
for
him
the
women
in
evening
gowns
the
girl
whose
name
was
anita
was
bewitching
in
pale
green
that
was
a
memorable
night
for
walter
stewart
with
his
own
kind
once
more
a
perfect
dinner
brisk
and
clever
conversation
enlivened
by
a
bit
of
sweet
champagne
an
hour
or
two
on
the
terrace
afterward
with
the
women
in
furs
and
stars
making
a
jeweled
crown
for
the
rax
he
entirely
forgot
marie
until
he
returned
to
the
villa
and
opening
the
door
of
the
room
found
her
missing
she
had
not
gone
far
at
the
sound
of
his
steps
she
moved
on
the
balcony
and
came
in
slowly
she
was
pale
and
pinched
with
cold
but
she
was
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
her
kind
she
smiled
didst
thou
have
a
fine
evening
wonderful
i
am
sorry
if
i
was
unpleasant
i
was
tired
now
i
am
good
little
marie
chapter
xii
the
card
in
the
american
doctors
club
brought
a
response
finally
it
was
just
in
time
harmony
funds
were
low
and
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
had
gone
to
moritz
for
the
winter
she
regretted
the
english
lessons
but
there
were
always
english
at
moritz
and
it
cost
nothing
to
talk
with
them
before
she
left
she
made
harmony
a
present
for
christmas
she
explained
it
was
a
glass
decorated
beneath
with
labels
from
the
herr
professor
cigars
and
in
the
center
a
picture
of
the
emperor
the
response
came
in
this
wise
harmony
struggling
home
against
an
east
wind
and
holding
the
and
her
violin
case
opened
the
old
garden
gate
by
the
simple
expedient
of
leaning
against
it
it
flew
back
violently
almost
overthrowing
a
stout
woman
in
process
of
egress
down
the
walk
the
stout
woman
was
boyer
clad
as
usual
in
the
best
broadcloth
and
wearing
her
old
sable
cape
made
over
according
to
her
oldest
daughter
ideas
into
a
staid
stole
and
muff
the
muff
lay
on
the
path
now
and
boyer
was
gasping
for
breath
i
so
sorry
harmony
exclaimed
it
was
stupid
of
me
but
the
wind
is
this
your
muff
boyer
took
the
muff
coldly
from
its
depths
she
proceeded
to
extract
a
handkerchief
and
with
the
handkerchief
she
brushed
down
the
broadcloth
harmony
stood
apologetically
by
it
is
explanatory
of
boyer
face
attitude
and
costume
that
the
girl
addressed
her
in
english
i
backed
in
she
explained
so
few
people
come
and
no
boyer
having
finished
her
brushing
and
responded
to
this
humble
apology
in
her
own
tongue
condescended
to
look
at
harmony
it
really
is
no
matter
she
said
still
coolly
but
with
indications
of
thawing
i
am
only
glad
it
did
not
strike
my
nose
i
dare
say
it
would
have
but
i
was
looking
up
to
see
if
it
were
going
to
here
she
saw
the
violin
case
and
became
almost
affable
there
was
a
card
in
the
doctors
club
and
i
called
she
hesitated
i
am
miss
wells
the
card
is
one
of
the
women
here
has
a
small
boy
who
wishes
to
take
violin
lessons
and
i
offered
to
come
the
mother
is
very
i
see
will
you
come
in
i
can
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
and
we
can
talk
about
boyer
was
very
willing
although
she
had
doubts
about
the
tea
she
had
had
no
good
tea
since
she
had
left
england
and
was
inclined
to
suspect
all
of
it
they
went
in
together
harmony
chatting
gayly
as
she
ran
ahead
explaining
this
bit
of
the
old
staircase
that
door
here
an
ancient
bit
of
furniture
not
considered
worthy
of
salvage
there
a
closed
and
locked
room
home
of
ghosts
and
legends
to
harmony
this
elderly
woman
climbing
slowly
behind
her
was
a
bit
of
home
there
had
been
many
such
in
her
life
women
no
longer
young
friends
of
her
mother
who
were
friends
of
hers
women
to
whom
she
had
been
wont
to
pay
the
courtesy
of
a
potted
hyacinth
at
easter
or
a
wreath
at
christmas
or
a
bit
of
custard
during
an
illness
she
had
missed
them
all
cruelly
as
she
had
missed
many
things
her
mother
her
church
her
small
gayeties
she
had
thought
at
first
that
frau
professor
bergmeister
might
allay
her
longing
for
these
comfortable
friends
of
hers
but
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
had
proved
to
be
a
frivolous
and
garrulous
old
woman
who
substituted
ease
for
comfort
and
who
burned
a
candle
on
the
of
her
first
husband
while
her
second
was
safely
out
of
the
house
so
it
was
with
something
of
excitement
that
harmony
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
peter
was
there
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
busily
engaged
in
polishing
the
horns
of
the
deer
whatever
scruples
harmony
had
had
about
the
horns
peter
had
none
whatever
save
to
get
them
safely
out
of
the
place
and
to
the
hospital
so
peter
was
polishing
the
horns
harmony
had
not
expected
to
find
him
home
and
paused
rather
startled
oh
i
did
know
you
were
peter
spoke
without
turning
try
to
bear
up
under
it
he
said
i
home
and
hungry
sweetheart
peter
please
peter
turned
at
that
and
rose
instantly
it
was
rather
dark
in
the
salon
and
he
did
not
immediately
recognize
boyer
but
that
lady
had
known
him
before
he
turned
had
taken
in
the
domesticity
of
the
scene
and
peter
part
in
it
and
had
drawn
the
swift
conclusion
of
the
pure
of
heart
i
come
again
she
said
hurriedly
i
i
must
really
get
home
boyer
will
be
there
and
wondering
mrs
boyer
peter
knew
her
oh
byrne
is
it
how
unexpected
to
find
you
here
i
live
so
i
three
of
us
said
peter
you
know
anna
gates
do
you
i
afraid
not
really
i
peter
was
determined
to
explain
his
very
eagerness
was
almost
damning
she
and
miss
wells
are
keeping
house
here
and
have
kindly
taken
me
in
as
a
boarder
please
sit
harmony
found
nothing
strange
in
the
situation
and
was
frankly
puzzled
at
peter
the
fact
that
there
was
anything
unusual
in
two
single
women
and
one
unmarried
man
unrelated
and
comparative
strangers
setting
up
housekeeping
together
had
never
occurred
to
her
many
a
single
woman
whom
she
knew
at
home
took
a
gentleman
into
the
house
as
a
roomer
and
thereafter
referred
to
him
as
he
and
spent
hours
airing
the
curtains
of
smoke
and
even
as
he
became
a
member
of
the
family
in
sewing
on
his
buttons
there
was
nothing
indecorous
about
such
an
arrangement
merely
a
concession
to
economic
pressure
she
made
tea
taking
off
her
jacket
and
gloves
to
do
it
but
bustling
about
cheerfully
with
her
hat
rather
awry
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
and
hope
just
now
when
the
frau
professor
had
gone
the
prospect
of
a
music
pupil
meant
everything
an
american
child
too
fond
as
harmony
was
of
children
the
sedate
and
dignified
youngsters
who
walked
the
parks
daily
with
a
governess
or
sat
with
folded
hands
and
fixed
eyes
through
hours
of
heavy
music
at
the
opera
rather
daunted
her
they
were
never
alone
those
austrian
children
always
under
surveillance
always
restrained
always
prepared
to
kiss
the
hand
of
whatever
relative
might
be
near
and
to
take
themselves
of
to
anywhere
so
it
were
somewhere
else
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
talk
to
me
about
an
american
child
said
harmony
bringing
in
the
tea
but
boyer
was
not
so
sure
she
was
going
to
talk
about
the
american
child
she
was
not
sure
of
anything
except
that
the
household
looked
most
irregular
and
that
peter
byrne
was
trying
to
cover
a
difficult
situation
with
much
conversation
he
was
almost
glib
was
peter
the
tea
was
good
that
was
one
thing
she
sat
back
with
her
muff
on
her
knee
having
refused
the
concession
of
putting
it
on
a
chair
as
savoring
too
much
of
acceptance
if
not
approval
and
sipped
her
tea
out
of
a
spoon
as
becomes
a
peter
who
loathed
tea
lounged
about
the
room
clearly
in
the
way
but
fearful
to
leave
harmony
alone
with
her
she
was
quite
likely
at
the
first
opportunity
to
read
her
a
lesson
on
the
conventions
if
nothing
worse
to
upset
the
delicate
balance
of
the
little
household
he
was
guarding
so
he
stayed
praying
for
anna
to
come
and
bear
out
his
story
while
harmony
toyed
with
her
spoon
and
waited
for
some
mention
of
the
lessons
none
came
boyer
having
finished
her
tea
rose
and
put
down
her
cup
that
was
very
refreshing
she
said
where
shall
i
find
the
i
walked
out
but
it
is
i
take
you
to
the
peter
picked
up
his
old
hat
thank
you
i
am
always
lost
in
this
wretched
town
i
give
the
conductors
double
tips
to
put
me
down
where
i
want
to
go
but
how
can
they
when
it
is
the
wrong
car
she
bowed
to
harmony
without
shaking
hands
thank
you
for
the
tea
it
was
really
good
where
do
you
get
it
there
is
a
a
door
or
two
from
the
grand
i
must
remember
that
thank
you
again
not
a
word
about
the
lessons
or
the
american
child
you
said
something
about
my
card
in
the
doctors
club
something
wistful
in
the
girl
eyes
caught
and
held
boyer
after
all
she
was
the
mother
of
daughters
she
held
out
her
hand
and
her
voice
was
not
so
hard
that
will
have
to
wait
until
another
time
i
have
made
a
social
visit
and
we
not
spoil
it
with
but
i
really
think
the
boy
mother
must
attend
to
that
herself
but
i
shall
tell
her
where
to
find
you
and
here
she
glanced
at
peter
all
about
thank
you
said
harmony
gratefully
peter
had
no
finesse
he
escorted
boyer
across
the
yard
and
through
the
gate
with
hardly
a
word
with
the
gate
closed
behind
them
he
turned
and
faced
her
you
are
going
away
with
a
wrong
impression
boyer
had
been
thinking
hard
as
she
crossed
the
yard
the
result
was
a
resolution
to
give
peter
a
piece
of
her
mind
she
drew
her
ample
proportions
into
a
dignity
that
was
almost
majesty
yes
i
i
can
understand
why
you
think
as
you
do
it
is
quite
without
i
am
glad
of
there
was
no
conviction
in
her
voice
of
course
went
on
peter
humbling
himself
for
harmony
sake
i
suppose
it
has
been
rather
unconventional
but
gates
is
not
a
young
woman
by
any
means
and
she
takes
very
good
care
of
miss
wells
there
were
reasons
why
this
seemed
the
best
thing
to
do
miss
wells
was
alone
and
there
is
a
gates
of
course
if
you
will
come
back
and
wait
she
be
along
very
boyer
was
convinced
and
defrauded
in
one
breath
convinced
that
there
might
be
a
gates
but
equally
convinced
that
the
situation
was
anomalous
and
certainly
suspicious
defrauded
in
that
she
had
lost
the
anticipated
pleasure
of
giving
peter
a
piece
of
her
mind
she
walked
along
beside
him
without
speaking
until
they
reached
the
line
then
she
turned
you
called
her
you
spoke
to
her
very
affectionately
young
man
she
accused
him
peter
smiled
the
car
was
close
some
imp
of
recklessness
some
perversion
of
humor
seized
him
my
dear
boyer
he
said
that
was
in
jest
purely
besides
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
there
boyer
was
a
literal
person
without
humor
it
was
outraged
american
womanhood
incarnate
that
got
into
the
and
settled
its
broadcloth
of
the
best
quality
indignantly
on
the
cane
seat
it
was
outraged
american
womanhood
that
flung
open
the
door
of
marie
flat
and
stalking
into
marie
jedlicka
sitting
room
confronted
her
husband
as
he
read
a
newspaper
from
home
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
doctor
named
gates
she
demanded
boyer
was
not
unaccustomed
to
such
verbal
attacks
he
had
learned
to
meet
domestic
broadsides
with
a
shield
of
impenetrable
good
humor
or
at
the
most
with
a
return
fire
of
mild
sarcasm
i
never
hear
of
a
woman
doctor
if
it
can
be
dr
gates
anna
gates
there
are
a
number
here
i
meet
them
in
the
hospital
but
i
do
know
their
where
does
peter
byrne
live
in
a
pension
i
believe
my
dear
are
we
going
to
have
anything
to
eat
or
do
we
sup
of
peter
byrne
boyer
made
no
immediate
reply
she
repaired
to
the
bedroom
of
marie
jedlicka
and
placed
her
hat
coat
and
furs
on
one
of
the
beds
with
the
crocheted
coverlets
it
is
a
curious
thing
about
rooms
there
was
no
change
in
the
bedroom
apparent
to
the
eye
save
that
for
marie
tiny
slippers
at
the
foot
of
the
wardrobe
there
were
boyer
substantial
house
shoes
but
in
some
indefinable
way
the
room
had
changed
about
it
hung
an
atmosphere
of
solid
respectability
of
impeccable
purity
that
soothed
boyer
ruffled
virtue
into
peace
is
it
any
wonder
that
there
is
a
theory
to
the
effect
that
things
take
on
the
essential
qualities
of
people
who
use
them
and
that
we
are
haunted
by
things
not
people
that
when
grandfather
wraith
is
seen
in
his
old
armchair
it
is
the
chair
that
produces
it
while
grandfather
himself
serenely
haunts
the
shades
of
some
vast
wilderness
of
departed
spirits
not
that
boyer
troubled
herself
about
such
things
she
was
exceedingly
orthodox
even
in
the
matter
of
a
hereafter
where
the
most
orthodox
are
apt
to
stretch
a
point
finding
no
attraction
whatever
in
the
thing
they
are
asked
to
believe
boyer
who
would
have
regarded
it
as
heterodox
to
substitute
any
other
instrument
for
the
harp
of
her
expectation
tied
on
her
gingham
apron
before
marie
jedlicka
mirror
and
thought
of
harmony
and
of
the
girls
at
home
she
told
her
husband
over
the
and
found
him
less
shocked
than
she
had
expected
it
not
your
affair
or
mine
he
said
it
byrne
think
of
the
girl
even
if
you
are
right
it
rather
late
is
it
you
could
tell
him
what
you
think
of
boyer
sighed
over
a
cup
of
very
excellent
coffee
much
living
with
a
representative
male
had
never
taught
his
wife
the
reserves
among
members
of
the
sex
masculine
i
might
but
i
do
intend
to
he
said
and
if
you
listen
to
me
you
keep
the
thing
to
i
take
precious
good
care
that
the
girl
gets
no
pupils
snapped
boyer
and
she
did
with
great
thoroughness
we
trace
a
life
by
its
scars
destiny
marching
on
by
a
thousand
painful
steps
had
left
its
usual
mark
a
footprint
on
a
naked
soul
the
soul
was
harmony
the
foot
was
it
not
encased
at
that
moment
in
boyer
comfortable
house
shoes
anna
was
very
late
that
night
peter
having
put
boyer
on
her
car
went
back
quickly
he
had
come
out
without
his
overcoat
and
with
the
sunset
a
bitter
wind
had
risen
but
he
was
too
indignant
to
be
cold
he
ran
up
the
staircase
hearing
on
all
sides
the
creaking
and
banging
with
which
the
old
house
resented
a
gale
and
burst
into
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
harmony
was
sitting
sidewise
in
a
chair
by
the
with
her
face
hidden
against
its
worn
red
velvet
she
did
not
look
up
when
he
entered
peter
went
over
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
quivered
under
it
and
he
took
it
away
crying
a
little
very
smothered
just
do
mind
me
you
mean
about
the
pupil
harmony
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
she
still
wore
her
hat
now
more
than
ever
askew
and
some
of
the
dye
from
the
velvet
had
stained
her
cheek
she
looked
rather
hectic
very
lovely
why
did
she
change
so
when
she
saw
you
peter
hesitated
afterward
he
thought
of
a
dozen
things
he
might
have
said
safe
things
not
one
came
to
him
she
she
is
an
old
woman
harry
he
said
gravely
she
did
not
approve
of
the
way
we
are
living
here
is
that
it
but
anna
she
did
not
believe
there
was
an
anna
not
that
it
matters
he
added
hastily
i
make
anna
go
to
her
and
explain
it
her
infernal
jumping
to
a
conclusion
that
makes
me
she
will
talk
peter
i
am
i
take
anna
and
we
go
to
boyer
i
make
that
woman
get
down
on
her
knees
to
you
i
you
make
bad
very
much
worse
said
harmony
dejectedly
when
a
thing
has
to
be
explained
it
does
no
good
to
explain
the
salon
was
growing
dark
peter
was
very
close
to
her
again
as
in
the
dusky
kitchen
only
a
few
days
before
he
felt
the
compelling
influence
of
her
nearness
he
wanted
as
he
had
never
wanted
anything
in
his
life
before
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
hold
her
close
and
bid
defiance
to
evil
tongues
he
was
afraid
of
himself
to
gain
a
moment
he
put
a
chair
between
them
and
stood
strong
hands
gripping
its
back
looking
down
at
her
there
is
one
thing
we
could
what
peter
we
could
marry
if
you
cared
for
me
even
a
little
it
it
might
not
be
so
bad
for
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
i
care
for
you
of
course
but
not
that
way
peter
and
i
do
not
wish
to
not
even
if
i
wish
it
very
much
if
you
are
thinking
of
my
future
i
thinking
for
both
of
us
and
although
just
now
you
think
you
care
a
little
for
me
you
do
not
care
enough
peter
you
are
lonely
and
i
am
the
only
person
you
see
much
so
you
think
you
want
to
marry
me
you
do
really
you
want
to
help
few
motives
are
unmixed
poor
peter
thus
accused
could
not
deny
his
altruism
and
in
the
face
of
his
poverty
and
the
little
he
could
offer
compared
with
what
she
must
lose
he
did
not
urge
what
was
the
compelling
motive
after
all
his
need
of
her
it
would
be
a
rotten
match
for
you
he
agreed
i
only
thought
perhaps
you
are
right
of
course
you
ought
not
to
and
what
about
you
i
ought
not
of
harmony
rose
smiling
a
little
then
that
settled
and
for
goodness
sake
peter
stop
proposing
to
me
every
time
things
go
her
voice
changed
grew
grave
and
older
much
older
than
peter
we
must
not
marry
either
of
us
peter
anna
is
right
there
might
be
an
excuse
if
we
were
very
much
in
love
but
we
are
not
and
loneliness
is
not
a
i
am
very
lonely
said
peter
wistfully
chapter
xiii
peter
took
the
polished
horns
to
the
hospital
the
next
morning
and
approached
jimmy
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
that
enshrouded
him
like
a
cloak
jimmy
having
had
a
good
night
and
having
taken
the
morning
medicine
without
argument
had
been
allowed
up
in
a
roller
chair
it
struck
peter
with
a
pang
that
the
boy
looked
more
frail
day
by
day
more
transparent
i
have
brought
you
said
peter
gravely
the
i
had
it
then
dad
letter
you
just
had
one
do
be
a
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
vegetable
said
peter
shamelessly
soft
or
hard
this
was
plainly
a
disappointment
a
pair
of
horns
might
be
vegetable
they
could
hardly
be
soft
a
kitten
a
kitten
is
not
vegetable
i
know
a
bowl
of
gelatin
from
harry
for
by
this
time
harmony
was
his
very
good
friend
admitted
to
the
jimmy
club
which
consisted
of
nurse
elisabet
the
dozent
with
the
red
beard
anna
and
peter
and
of
course
the
sentry
who
did
not
know
that
he
belonged
gelatin
to
be
sure
replied
peter
and
produced
the
horns
it
was
a
joyous
moment
in
the
long
low
ward
with
its
triple
row
of
beds
its
barred
windows
its
clean
uneven
old
floor
as
if
to
add
a
touch
of
completeness
the
sentry
outside
peering
in
saw
the
wheeled
chair
with
its
occupant
and
celebrated
this
advance
along
the
road
to
recovery
by
placing
on
the
a
wooden
replica
of
himself
bayonet
and
all
carved
from
a
bit
of
cigar
box
everybody
is
very
nice
to
me
said
jimmy
contentedly
when
my
father
comes
back
i
shall
tell
him
he
is
very
fond
of
people
who
are
kind
to
me
there
was
a
woman
on
the
ship
what
is
bulging
your
pocket
peter
my
that
is
not
where
you
mostly
carry
your
peter
was
injured
he
scowled
ferociously
at
being
doubted
and
stood
up
before
the
wheeled
chair
to
be
searched
the
ward
watched
joyously
while
from
pocket
after
pocket
of
peter
old
gray
suit
came
salvage
two
nuts
a
packet
of
figs
a
postcard
that
represented
a
stout
colonel
of
hussars
on
his
back
on
a
frozen
lake
with
a
private
soldier
waiting
to
go
through
the
various
salutations
due
his
rank
before
assisting
him
a
gala
day
indeed
if
one
could
forget
the
grave
in
the
little
mountain
town
with
only
a
name
on
the
cross
at
its
head
and
if
one
did
not
notice
that
the
boy
was
thinner
than
ever
that
his
hands
soon
tired
of
playing
and
lay
in
his
lap
that
nurse
elisabet
who
was
much
inured
to
death
and
lived
her
days
with
tragedy
caught
him
to
her
almost
fiercely
as
she
lifted
him
back
from
the
chair
into
the
smooth
white
bed
he
fell
asleep
with
peter
arm
under
his
head
and
the
horns
of
the
deer
beside
him
on
the
bedside
stand
stood
the
wooden
sentry
keeping
guard
as
peter
drew
his
arm
away
he
became
aware
of
the
nurse
elisabet
beckoning
to
him
from
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
ward
peter
left
the
sentinel
on
guard
and
tiptoed
down
the
room
just
outside
round
a
corner
was
the
dozent
laboratory
and
beyond
the
tiny
closet
where
he
slept
where
on
a
stand
was
the
photograph
of
the
lady
he
would
marry
when
he
had
become
a
professor
and
required
no
one
consent
the
dozent
was
waiting
for
peter
in
the
amiable
conspiracy
which
kept
the
boy
happy
he
was
his
familiarity
with
austrian
intrigue
had
made
him
invaluable
he
it
was
who
had
originated
the
idea
of
making
jimmy
responsible
for
the
order
of
the
ward
so
that
a
burly
trager
quarreling
over
his
daily
tobacco
with
the
nurse
in
charge
or
brawling
over
his
soup
with
another
patient
was
likely
to
be
hailed
in
a
thin
soprano
and
to
stand
grinning
sheepishly
while
jimmy
in
mixed
english
and
german
restored
the
decorum
of
the
ward
they
were
a
quarrelsome
lot
the
convalescents
jimmy
was
so
busy
some
days
settling
disputes
and
awarding
decisions
that
he
slept
almost
all
night
this
was
as
it
should
be
the
dozent
waited
for
peter
his
red
beard
twitched
and
his
white
coat
stained
from
the
laboratory
table
looked
quite
villainous
he
held
out
a
letter
this
has
come
for
the
child
he
said
in
quite
good
english
he
was
obliged
to
speak
english
day
by
day
he
taught
in
the
clinics
americans
who
scorned
his
native
tongue
and
who
brought
him
the
money
with
which
some
day
he
would
marry
he
liked
the
english
language
he
liked
americans
because
they
learned
quickly
he
held
out
an
envelope
with
a
black
border
and
peter
took
it
from
paris
he
said
who
in
the
world
i
suppose
i
better
open
so
i
thought
it
appears
a
letter
of
how
you
say
it
ah
yes
peter
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
then
without
a
word
he
gave
it
open
to
the
dozent
there
was
silence
in
the
laboratory
while
the
dozent
read
it
silence
except
for
his
canary
which
was
chipping
at
a
lump
of
sugar
peter
face
was
very
sober
so
a
mother
you
knew
nothing
of
a
mother
something
from
the
papers
i
found
she
left
when
the
boy
was
a
baby
went
on
the
stage
i
think
he
has
no
recollection
of
her
which
is
a
good
thing
she
seems
to
have
been
a
bad
she
comes
to
take
him
away
that
is
of
course
it
is
impossible
said
peter
savagely
she
not
going
to
see
the
child
if
i
can
help
it
she
left
because
she
the
mother
but
that
the
best
you
can
say
of
her
this
letter
well
you
read
she
is
as
a
stranger
to
him
absolutely
she
will
come
in
mourning
look
at
that
black
border
and
tell
him
his
father
is
dead
and
kill
him
i
know
the
the
canary
chipped
at
his
sugar
the
red
beard
of
the
dozent
twitched
as
does
the
beard
of
one
who
plots
peter
the
gushing
letter
in
his
hand
and
thought
fiercely
she
is
on
her
way
here
said
the
dozent
that
is
bad
paris
to
wien
is
two
days
and
a
night
she
may
hourly
we
might
send
him
away
to
another
the
dozent
shrugged
his
shoulders
had
i
a
home
he
said
and
glanced
through
the
door
to
the
portrait
on
the
stand
it
would
be
possible
to
hide
the
boy
at
least
for
a
time
in
the
interval
the
mother
might
be
watched
and
if
she
proved
a
fit
person
the
boy
could
be
given
to
her
it
is
of
course
an
affair
of
this
gave
peter
pause
he
had
no
money
for
fines
no
time
for
imprisonment
and
he
shared
the
common
horror
of
the
great
jail
he
read
the
letter
again
and
tried
to
read
into
the
lines
jimmy
mother
and
failed
he
glanced
into
the
ward
still
jimmy
slept
a
burly
convalescent
with
a
saber
cut
from
temple
to
ear
and
the
general
appearance
of
an
assassin
had
stopped
beside
the
bed
and
was
drawing
up
the
blanket
round
the
small
shoulders
i
can
give
orders
that
the
woman
be
not
admitted
said
the
dozent
that
gives
us
a
few
hours
she
will
go
to
the
police
and
she
will
be
admitted
in
the
mean
time
in
the
mean
time
peter
replied
i
try
to
think
of
something
if
i
thought
she
could
be
warned
and
would
leave
him
here
she
will
not
she
will
buy
him
garments
and
she
will
travel
with
him
through
the
riviera
and
to
nice
she
says
nice
she
wishes
to
be
there
for
carnival
and
the
boy
will
peter
took
the
letter
and
went
home
he
rode
that
he
might
read
it
again
in
the
bus
but
no
scrap
of
comfort
could
he
get
from
it
it
spoke
of
the
dead
father
coldly
and
the
father
had
been
the
boy
idol
no
good
woman
could
have
been
so
heartless
it
offered
the
boy
a
seat
in
one
of
the
least
reputable
of
the
paris
theaters
to
hear
his
mother
sing
and
in
the
envelope
overlooked
before
peter
found
a
cutting
from
a
french
newspaper
a
picture
of
the
type
that
made
him
groan
it
was
indorsed
harmony
had
had
a
busy
morning
first
she
had
put
her
house
in
order
working
deftly
her
pretty
hair
pinned
up
in
a
towel
all
in
order
but
peter
room
that
was
to
have
a
special
cleaning
later
next
still
with
her
hair
tied
up
she
had
spent
two
hours
with
her
violin
standing
very
close
to
the
stove
to
save
fuel
and
keep
her
fingers
warm
she
played
well
that
morning
even
her
own
critical
ears
were
satisfied
and
the
portier
repairing
a
window
lock
in
an
empty
room
below
was
entranced
he
sat
on
the
window
sill
in
the
biting
cold
and
listened
many
music
students
had
lived
in
the
apartment
with
the
great
salon
there
had
been
much
music
of
one
sort
and
another
but
none
like
this
she
tears
my
heart
from
my
bosom
muttered
the
portier
sighing
and
almost
swallowed
a
screw
that
he
held
in
his
teeth
after
the
practicing
harmony
cleaned
peter
room
she
felt
very
tender
toward
peter
that
day
the
hurt
left
by
boyer
visit
had
died
away
but
there
remained
a
clear
vision
of
peter
standing
behind
the
chair
and
offering
himself
humbly
in
marriage
so
that
a
bad
situation
might
be
made
better
and
as
with
a
man
tenderness
expresses
itself
in
the
giving
of
gifts
so
with
a
woman
it
means
giving
of
service
harmony
cleaned
peter
room
it
was
really
rather
tidy
peter
few
belongings
did
not
spread
to
any
extent
and
years
of
bachelorhood
had
taught
him
the
rudiments
of
order
harmony
took
the
covers
from
washstand
and
dressing
table
and
washed
and
ironed
them
she
cleaned
peter
worn
brushes
and
brought
a
pincushion
of
her
own
for
his
one
extra
scarfpin
finally
she
brought
her
own
steamer
rug
and
folded
it
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
was
no
stove
in
the
room
it
had
been
harmony
room
once
and
she
knew
to
the
full
how
cold
it
could
be
having
made
all
comfortable
for
the
outer
man
she
prepared
for
the
inner
she
was
in
the
kitchen
still
with
her
hair
tied
up
when
anna
came
home
anna
was
preoccupied
instead
of
her
cheery
greeting
she
came
somberly
back
to
the
kitchen
a
letter
in
her
hand
history
was
making
fast
that
day
hello
harry
she
said
i
going
to
take
a
bite
and
hurry
off
bother
i
attend
to
she
stuffed
the
letter
in
her
belt
and
got
a
plate
from
a
shelf
how
pretty
you
look
with
your
head
tied
up
if
stupid
peter
saw
you
now
he
would
fall
in
love
with
then
i
shall
take
it
off
peter
must
be
saved
anna
sat
down
at
the
tiny
table
and
drank
her
tea
she
felt
rather
better
after
the
tea
harmony
having
taken
the
towel
off
was
busy
over
the
brick
stove
there
was
nothing
said
for
a
moment
then
i
am
out
of
patience
with
peter
said
anna
why
because
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
you
where
are
his
eyes
please
anna
it
better
as
it
is
no
doubt
for
both
of
you
but
it
superhuman
of
peter
i
wonder
yes
i
think
i
not
tell
you
what
i
and
harmony
rather
afraid
of
anna
frank
speech
did
not
insist
as
she
drank
her
tea
and
made
a
pretense
at
eating
anna
thoughts
wandered
from
peter
to
harmony
to
the
letter
in
her
belt
and
back
again
to
peter
and
harmony
for
some
time
she
had
been
suspicious
of
peter
from
her
dozen
years
of
advantage
in
age
and
experience
she
looked
down
on
peter
thirty
years
of
youth
and
thought
she
knew
something
that
peter
himself
did
not
suspect
peter
being
unintrospective
anna
did
his
for
him
she
believed
he
was
madly
in
love
with
harmony
and
did
not
himself
suspect
it
as
she
watched
the
girl
over
her
teacup
revealing
herself
in
a
thousand
unposed
gestures
of
youth
and
grace
a
thousand
lovelinesses
something
of
the
responsibility
she
and
peter
had
assumed
came
over
her
she
sighed
and
felt
for
her
letter
i
had
rather
bad
news
she
said
at
last
from
home
yes
my
father
did
you
know
i
have
a
father
you
had
spoken
of
i
never
do
as
a
father
he
has
amounted
to
much
but
he
very
ill
and
i
a
harmony
turned
a
startled
face
to
her
you
are
not
going
back
to
america
oh
no
not
now
anyhow
if
i
become
hag
ridden
with
remorse
and
do
go
i
find
some
one
to
take
my
place
do
the
lunch
was
a
silent
meal
anna
was
hurrying
off
as
peter
came
in
and
there
was
no
time
to
discuss
peter
new
complication
with
her
harmony
and
peter
ate
together
harmony
rather
silent
anna
unfortunate
comment
about
peter
had
made
her
constrained
after
the
meal
peter
pipe
in
mouth
carried
the
dishes
to
the
kitchen
and
there
it
was
that
he
gave
her
the
letter
what
peter
slower
mind
had
been
a
perceptible
time
in
grasping
harmony
comprehended
at
once
and
not
only
the
situation
but
its
solution
do
let
her
have
him
she
said
putting
down
the
letter
bring
him
here
oh
peter
how
good
we
must
be
to
him
and
that
after
all
was
how
the
thing
was
settled
so
simple
so
obvious
was
it
that
these
three
expatriates
these
waifs
and
estrays
banded
together
against
a
common
poverty
a
common
loneliness
should
share
without
question
whatever
was
theirs
to
divide
peter
and
anna
gave
cheerfully
of
their
substance
harmony
of
her
labor
that
a
small
boy
should
be
saved
a
tragic
knowledge
until
he
was
well
enough
to
bear
it
or
until
if
god
so
willed
he
might
learn
it
himself
without
pain
the
friendly
sentry
on
duty
again
that
night
proved
singularly
blind
thus
it
happened
that
although
the
night
was
clear
when
the
twin
dials
of
the
votivkirche
showed
nine
he
did
not
notice
a
cab
that
halted
across
the
street
from
the
hospital
still
more
strange
that
although
peter
passed
within
a
dozen
feet
of
him
carrying
a
wriggling
and
excited
figure
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
insisting
on
uncovering
its
feet
the
sentry
was
able
the
next
day
to
say
that
he
had
observed
such
a
person
carrying
a
bundle
but
that
it
was
a
short
stocky
person
quite
lame
and
that
the
bundle
was
undoubtedly
clothing
going
to
the
laundry
perhaps
it
is
just
possible
the
sentry
had
his
suspicions
it
is
undeniable
that
as
jimmy
in
the
cab
on
peter
knee
with
peter
arm
close
about
him
looked
back
at
the
hospital
the
sentry
was
going
through
the
manual
of
arms
very
solemnly
under
the
stars
and
facing
toward
the
carriage
chapter
xiv
for
two
days
at
semmering
it
rained
the
raxalpe
and
the
schneeberg
sulked
behind
walls
of
mist
from
the
little
balcony
of
the
pension
waldheim
one
looked
out
over
a
sea
of
cloud
pierced
here
and
there
by
islands
that
were
crags
or
by
the
tops
of
sunken
masts
that
were
evergreen
trees
the
roads
were
masses
of
slippery
mud
up
which
the
horses
steamed
and
sweated
the
gray
cloud
fog
hung
over
everything
the
barking
of
a
dog
loomed
out
of
it
near
at
hand
where
no
dog
was
to
be
seen
children
cried
and
wild
birds
squawked
one
saw
them
not
during
the
second
night
a
landslide
occurred
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
with
a
rumble
like
the
noise
of
fifty
trains
in
the
morning
the
rain
clouds
lifting
for
a
moment
marie
saw
the
narrow
yellow
line
of
the
slip
everything
was
saturated
with
moisture
it
did
no
good
to
close
the
heavy
wooden
shutters
at
night
in
the
morning
the
air
of
the
room
was
sticky
and
clothing
was
moist
to
the
touch
stewart
confined
to
the
house
grew
irritable
marie
watched
him
anxiously
she
knew
quite
well
by
what
slender
tenure
she
held
her
man
they
had
nothing
in
common
neither
speech
nor
thought
and
the
little
marie
love
for
stewart
grown
to
be
a
part
of
her
was
largely
maternal
she
held
him
by
mothering
him
by
keeping
him
comfortable
not
by
a
great
reciprocal
passion
that
might
in
time
have
brought
him
to
her
in
chains
and
now
he
was
uncomfortable
he
chafed
against
the
confinement
he
resented
the
food
the
weather
even
marie
content
at
her
unusual
leisure
irked
him
he
accused
her
of
purring
like
a
cat
by
the
fire
and
stamped
out
more
than
once
only
to
be
driven
in
by
the
curious
thunderstorms
of
early
alpine
winter
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
the
weather
changed
marie
awakening
early
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
her
a
new
world
lay
beneath
her
a
marvel
of
glittering
branches
of
white
plain
far
below
the
snowy
mane
of
the
raxalpe
was
become
a
garment
and
from
behind
the
villa
came
the
cheerful
sound
of
of
horses
feet
on
crisp
snow
of
runners
sliding
easily
along
frozen
roads
even
the
barking
of
the
dog
in
the
next
yard
had
ceased
rumbling
and
become
sharp
staccato
the
balcony
extended
round
the
corner
of
the
house
marie
eagerly
discovering
her
new
world
peered
about
and
seeing
no
one
near
ventured
so
far
the
road
was
in
view
and
a
small
girl
on
ski
was
struggling
to
prevent
a
collision
between
two
plump
feet
even
as
marie
saw
her
the
inevitable
happened
and
she
went
headlong
into
a
drift
a
governess
who
had
been
kneeling
before
a
shrine
by
the
road
hastily
crossed
herself
and
ran
to
the
rescue
it
was
a
marvelous
morning
a
day
of
days
the
governess
and
the
child
went
on
out
of
vision
marie
stood
still
looking
at
the
shrine
a
drift
had
piled
about
its
foot
where
the
governess
had
placed
a
bunch
of
alpine
flowers
down
on
her
knees
on
the
balcony
went
the
little
marie
regardless
of
the
snow
and
prayed
to
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
below
for
what
for
forgiveness
for
a
better
life
not
at
all
she
prayed
that
the
heels
of
the
american
girl
would
keep
her
in
out
of
the
snow
the
prayer
of
the
wicked
availeth
nothing
even
the
godly
at
times
must
suffer
disappointment
and
when
one
prays
of
heels
who
can
know
of
the
yearning
back
of
the
praying
marie
rising
and
dusting
her
chilled
knees
saw
the
party
of
americans
on
the
road
clad
in
stout
boots
and
swinging
along
gayly
marie
shrugged
her
shoulders
resignedly
she
should
have
gone
to
the
shrine
itself
a
balcony
was
not
a
holy
place
but
one
thing
she
determined
the
americans
went
toward
the
sonnwendstein
she
would
advise
against
the
sonnwendstein
for
that
day
marie
day
of
days
had
begun
wrong
after
all
for
stewart
rose
with
the
sonnwendstein
in
his
mind
and
no
suggestion
of
marie
that
in
another
day
a
path
would
be
broken
had
any
effect
on
him
he
was
eager
to
be
off
committed
the
extravagance
of
ordering
an
egg
apiece
for
breakfast
and
finally
proclaimed
that
if
marie
feared
the
climb
he
would
go
alone
marie
made
many
delays
she
dressed
slowly
and
must
run
back
to
see
if
the
balcony
door
was
securely
closed
at
a
little
shop
where
they
stopped
to
buy
mountain
sticks
she
must
purchase
postcards
and
send
them
at
once
stewart
was
fairly
patient
air
and
exercise
were
having
their
effect
it
was
eleven
when
having
crossed
the
valley
they
commenced
to
mount
the
slope
of
the
sonnwendstein
the
climb
was
easy
the
road
wound
back
and
forward
on
itself
so
that
one
ascended
with
hardly
an
effort
stewart
gave
marie
a
hand
here
and
there
and
even
paused
to
let
her
sit
on
a
boulder
and
rest
the
snow
was
not
heavy
he
showed
her
the
footprints
of
a
party
that
had
gone
ahead
and
to
amuse
her
tried
to
count
the
number
of
people
when
he
found
it
was
five
he
grew
thoughtful
there
were
five
in
anita
party
thanks
to
marie
delays
they
met
the
americans
coming
down
the
meeting
was
a
short
one
the
party
went
on
down
gayly
talking
marie
and
stewart
climbed
silently
marie
day
was
spoiled
stewart
had
promised
to
dine
at
the
hotel
even
the
view
at
the
tourist
house
did
not
restore
marie
fallen
spirits
what
were
the
vienna
plain
and
the
styrian
alps
to
her
with
this
impatient
and
frowning
man
beside
her
consulting
his
watch
and
computing
the
time
until
he
might
see
the
american
again
what
was
prayer
if
this
were
its
answer
they
descended
rapidly
stewart
always
in
the
lead
and
setting
a
pace
that
marie
struggled
in
vain
to
meet
to
her
tentative
and
breathless
remarks
he
made
brief
answer
and
only
once
in
all
that
time
did
he
volunteer
a
remark
they
had
reached
the
hotel
erzherzog
in
the
valley
the
hotel
was
still
closed
and
marie
panting
sat
down
on
an
edge
of
the
terrace
we
have
been
very
foolish
he
said
why
being
seen
together
like
but
why
could
you
not
walk
with
any
woman
it
not
that
said
stewart
hastily
i
suppose
once
does
not
matter
but
we
ca
be
seen
together
all
the
marie
turned
white
the
time
had
gone
by
when
an
incident
of
the
sort
could
have
been
met
with
scorn
or
with
threats
things
had
changed
for
marie
jedlicka
since
the
day
peter
had
refused
to
introduce
her
to
harmony
then
it
had
been
vanity
now
it
was
life
itself
what
you
mean
she
said
with
pale
lips
is
that
we
must
not
be
seen
together
at
all
must
i
do
you
wish
me
to
remain
a
prisoner
while
you
she
choked
for
heaven
sake
he
broke
out
brutally
do
make
a
scene
there
are
men
cutting
ice
over
there
of
course
you
are
not
a
prisoner
you
may
go
where
you
marie
rose
and
picked
up
her
muff
marie
sordid
little
tragedy
played
itself
out
in
semmering
stewart
neglected
her
almost
completely
he
took
fewer
and
fewer
meals
at
the
villa
in
two
weeks
he
spent
one
evening
with
the
girl
and
was
so
irritable
that
she
went
to
bed
crying
the
little
mountain
resort
was
filling
up
there
were
more
and
more
americans

was
drawing
near
and
a
dozen
or
so
american
doctors
came
up
bringing
their
families
for
the
holidays
it
was
difficult
to
enter
a
shop
without
encountering
some
of
them
to
add
to
the
difficulty
the
party
at
the
hotel
finding
it
crowded
there
decided
to
go
into
a
pension
and
suggested
moving
to
the
waldheim
stewart
himself
was
wretchedly
uncomfortable
marie
tragedy
was
his
predicament
he
disliked
himself
very
cordially
loathing
himself
and
his
situation
with
the
humility
of
the
lover
for
stewart
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
marie
knew
it
she
had
not
lived
with
him
for
months
without
knowing
his
every
thought
every
mood
she
grew
bitter
and
hard
those
days
sitting
alone
by
the
green
stove
in
the
pension
waldheim
or
leaning
elbows
on
the
rail
looking
from
the
balcony
over
the
valley
far
below
bitter
and
hard
that
is
during
his
absences
he
had
but
to
enter
the
room
and
her
rage
died
to
be
replaced
with
yearning
and
little
shy
tentative
advances
that
he
only
tolerated
wild
thoughts
came
to
marie
especially
at
night
when
the
stars
made
a
crown
over
the
rax
and
in
the
hotel
an
orchestra
played
while
people
dined
and
laughed
and
loved
she
grew
obstinate
too
when
in
his
desperation
stewart
suggested
that
they
go
back
to
vienna
she
openly
scoffed
why
she
demanded
that
you
may
come
back
here
to
her
leaving
me
there
my
dear
girl
he
flung
back
exasperated
this
affair
was
not
a
permanent
one
you
knew
that
at
the
you
have
taken
me
away
from
my
work
i
have
two
months
vacation
it
is
but
one
go
back
and
let
me
pay
no
in
pursuance
of
the
plan
to
leave
the
hotel
the
american
party
came
to
see
the
waldheim
and
catastrophe
almost
ensued
luckily
marie
was
on
the
balcony
when
the
landlady
flung
open
the
door
and
announced
it
as
stewart
apartment
but
stewart
had
a
bad
five
minutes
and
took
it
out
manlike
on
the
girl
stewart
had
another
reason
for
not
wishing
to
leave
semmering
anita
was
beautiful
a
bit
of
a
coquette
too
as
are
most
pretty
women
and
stewart
was
not
alone
in
his
devotion
a
member
of
the
party
a
new
yorker
named
adam
was
much
in
love
with
the
girl
and
indifferent
who
knew
it
stewart
detested
him
in
his
despair
stewart
wrote
to
peter
byrne
it
was
characteristic
of
peter
that
however
indifferent
people
might
be
in
prosperity
they
always
turned
to
him
in
trouble
stewart
letter
concluded
i
have
made
out
a
poor
case
for
myself
but
i
in
a
hole
as
you
can
see
i
would
like
to
chuck
everything
here
and
sail
for
home
with
these
people
who
go
in
january
but
confound
it
byrne
what
am
i
to
do
with
marie
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
been
wanting
to
say
all
along
and
have
had
the
courage
to
marie
likes
you
and
you
rather
liked
her
did
you
you
could
talk
her
into
reason
if
anybody
could
now
that
you
know
how
things
are
ca
you
come
up
over
sunday
it
asking
a
lot
and
i
know
it
but
things
are
pretty
peter
received
the
letter
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
christmas
he
read
it
several
times
and
recalling
the
look
he
had
seen
more
than
once
in
marie
jedlicka
eyes
he
knew
that
things
were
very
bad
indeed
but
peter
was
a
man
of
family
in
those
days
and
christmas
is
a
family
festival
not
to
be
lightly
ignored
he
wired
to
stewart
that
he
would
come
up
as
soon
as
possible
after
christmas
then
because
of
the
look
in
marie
eyes
and
because
he
feared
for
her
a
sad
christmas
full
of
heartaches
and
god
knows
what
loneliness
he
bought
her
a
most
hideous
brooch
which
he
thought
admirable
in
every
way
and
highly
ornamental
and
which
he
could
not
afford
at
all
this
he
mailed
with
a
cheery
greeting
and
feeling
happier
and
much
poorer
made
his
way
homeward
chapter
xv
in
the
saloon
of
maria
theresa
with
the
great
chandelier
recklessly
ablaze
and
a
pig
head
with
cranberry
eyes
for
supper
with
a
tree
gleaming
with
candles
on
the
stand
and
beside
the
stand
in
a
huge
chair
jimmy
it
had
been
a
busy
day
for
harmony
in
the
morning
there
had
been
shopping
and
marketing
and
such
a
temptation
to
be
reckless
with
the
shops
full
of
ecstasies
and
the
old
flower
women
fairly
overburdened
there
had
been
anxieties
too
such
as
the
pig
head
which
must
be
done
a
certain
way
and
jimmy
who
must
be
left
with
the
portier
wife
as
nurse
while
all
of
them
went
to
the
hospital
the
house
revolved
around
jimmy
now
jimmy
who
seemed
the
better
for
the
moving
and
whose
mother
as
yet
had
failed
to
materialize
in
the
afternoon
harmony
played
at
the
hospital
peter
took
her
as
the
early
twilight
was
falling
in
through
the
gate
where
the
sentry
kept
guard
and
so
to
the
great
courtyard
in
this
grim
playground
men
wandered
about
smoking
their
daily
allowance
of
tobacco
and
moving
to
keep
warm
offscourings
of
the
barracks
derelicts
of
the
slums
with
here
and
there
an
honest
citizen
lamenting
a
christmas
away
from
home
the
hospital
was
always
pathetic
to
harmony
on
this
she
found
it
harrowing
its
very
size
shocked
her
that
there
should
be
so
much
suffering
so
much
that
was
appalling
frightful
insupportable
peter
felt
her
quiver
under
his
hand
a
hospital
in
festivity
is
very
affecting
it
smiles
through
its
tears
and
in
every
assemblage
there
are
sharply
defined
lines
of
difference
there
are
those
who
are
going
home
soon
god
willing
there
are
those
who
will
go
home
some
time
after
long
days
and
longer
nights
and
there
are
those
who
will
never
go
home
and
who
know
it
and
because
of
this
the
ones
who
are
never
going
home
are
most
festively
clad
as
if
by
way
of
compensation
the
nurses
mean
to
give
them
all
future
christmasses
in
one
they
receive
an
extra
orange
or
a
pair
of
gloves
perhaps
and
they
are
not
the
less
grateful
because
they
understand
and
when
everything
is
over
they
lay
away
in
the
bedside
stand
the
gloves
they
will
never
wear
and
divide
the
extra
orange
with
a
less
fortunate
one
who
is
almost
recovered
their
last
christmas
is
past
how
beautiful
the
tree
was
they
say
or
did
you
hear
how
the
children
sang
so
little
to
sing
like
that
it
made
me
think
of
peter
led
harmony
across
the
courtyard
through
many
twisting
corridors
and
up
and
down
more
twisting
staircases
to
the
room
where
she
was
to
play
there
were
many
christmas
trees
in
the
hospital
that
afternoon
no
one
hall
could
have
held
the
thousands
of
patients
the
doctors
the
nurses
sometimes
a
single
ward
had
its
own
tree
its
own
entertainment
occasionally
two
or
three
joined
forces
preempted
a
and
wheeled
or
hobbled
or
carried
in
their
convalescents
in
such
case
an
imposing
audience
was
the
result
into
such
a
room
peter
led
harmony
it
was
an
amphitheater
the
seats
rising
in
tiers
half
circle
above
half
circle
to
the
dusk
of
the
roof
in
the
pit
stood
the
tree
there
was
no
other
illumination
in
the
room
the
the
blazing
tree
the
rows
of
hopeful
hoping
hopeless
rising
above
white
faces
over
white
gowns
the
soft
rustle
of
expectancy
the
silence
when
the
dozent
with
the
red
beard
stepped
out
and
began
to
read
an
address
all
caught
harmony
by
the
throat
peter
keenly
alive
to
everything
she
did
felt
rather
than
heard
her
soft
sob
peter
saw
the
hospital
anew
that
dark
afternoon
saw
it
through
harmony
eyes
layer
after
layer
his
professional
callus
fell
away
leaving
him
quick
again
he
had
lived
so
long
close
to
the
heart
of
humanity
that
he
had
reduced
its
throbbing
to
beats
that
might
be
counted
now
once
more
peter
was
back
in
the
early
days
when
a
heart
was
not
a
pump
but
a
thing
that
ached
or
thrilled
or
struggled
that
loved
or
hated
or
yearned
the
orchestra
insisting
on
sadly
sentimental
music
was
fast
turning
festivity
into
gloom
it
played
handel
largo
it
threw
its
whole
soul
into
the
assurance
that
the
world
after
all
was
only
a
poor
place
that
heaven
was
a
better
it
preached
resignation
with
every
deep
vibration
of
the
cello
harmony
fidgeted
how
terrible
she
whispered
to
turn
their
into
mourning
stop
them
stop
a
german
orchestra
they
are
crying
some
of
them
oh
peter
the
music
came
to
an
end
at
last
tears
were
dried
followed
recitations
gifts
a
speech
of
thanks
from
nurse
elisabet
for
the
patients
then
harmony
harmony
never
remembered
afterward
what
she
had
played
it
was
joyous
she
knew
for
the
whole
atmosphere
changed
laughter
came
even
the
candles
burned
more
cheerfully
when
she
had
finished
a
student
in
a
white
coat
asked
her
to
play
a
german
volkspiel
and
roared
it
out
to
her
accompaniment
with
much
vigor
and
humor
the
audience
joined
in
at
first
timidly
then
lustily
harmony
stood
alone
by
the
tree
violin
poised
smiling
at
the
applause
her
eyes
running
along
the
dim
amphitheater
sought
peter
and
finding
them
dwelt
there
a
moment
then
she
began
to
play
softly
and
as
softly
the
others
sang
stille
nacht
heilige
nacht
they
sang
with
upturned
eyes
alles
schlaeft
einsam
wacht
visions
came
to
peter
that
afternoon
in
the
darkness
visions
in
which
his
poverty
was
forgotten
or
mattered
not
at
all
visions
of
a
in
a
home
that
he
had
earned
of
a
tree
of
a
of
a
still
and
holy
night
of
a
child
nur
das
traute
hoch
heilige
paar
holder
knabe
im
lockigen
haar
in
himmlischer
ruh
schlaf
in
himmlischer
ruh
they
sang
there
was
real
festivity
at
the
old
lodge
of
maria
theresa
that
night
jimmy
had
taken
his
full
place
in
the
household
the
best
room
which
had
been
anna
had
been
given
up
to
him
here
carefully
tended
with
a
fire
all
day
in
the
stove
jimmy
reigned
from
the
bed
to
him
harmony
brought
her
small
puzzles
and
together
they
solved
them
shall
it
be
a
steak
thus
harmony
humbly
or
chops
with
tomato
sauce
if
peter
allows
much
thinking
on
jimmy
part
and
then
fish
he
would
decide
fish
with
egg
they
would
argue
for
a
time
and
compromise
on
fish
the
boy
was
better
peter
shook
his
head
over
any
permanent
improvement
but
anna
fiercely
seized
each
crumb
of
hope
many
and
bitter
were
the
battles
she
and
peter
fought
at
night
over
his
treatment
frightful
the
litter
of
authorities
harmony
put
straight
every
morning
the
extra
expense
was
not
much
but
it
told
peter
carefully
calculated
expenditures
felt
the
strain
he
gave
up
a
course
in
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
and
cut
off
his
hour
in
the
as
a
luxury
there
was
no
hardship
about
the
latter
renunciation
life
for
peter
was
spelling
itself
very
much
in
terms
of
harmony
and
jimmy
those
days
he
resented
anything
that
took
him
from
them
there
were
anxieties
of
a
different
sort
also
anna
father
was
failing
he
had
written
her
a
feeble
appeal
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
come
back
to
see
him
before
he
died
anna
was
great
prop
what
would
he
do
should
she
decide
to
go
home
he
had
built
his
house
on
the
sand
indeed
so
far
the
threatened
danger
of
a
mother
to
jimmy
had
not
materialized
peter
was
puzzled
but
satisfied
he
still
wrote
letters
of
marvelous
adventure
jimmy
still
watched
for
them
listened
breathless
treasured
them
under
his
pillow
but
he
spoke
less
of
his
father
the
open
page
of
his
childish
mind
was
being
written
over
with
new
impressions
dad
was
already
a
memory
peter
and
harmony
and
anna
were
realities
sometimes
he
called
peter
at
those
times
peter
caught
the
boy
to
him
in
an
agony
of
tenderness
and
as
the
little
apartment
revolved
round
jimmy
so
was
this
given
up
to
him
all
day
he
had
stayed
in
bed
for
the
privilege
of
an
extra
hour
propped
up
among
pillows
in
the
salon
all
day
he
had
strung
little
red
berries
that
looked
like
cranberries
for
the
tree
or
fastened
threads
to
the
tiny
cakes
that
were
for
trimming
only
and
sternly
forbidden
to
eat
a
marvelous
day
that
for
jimmy
late
in
the
afternoon
the
portier
with
a
collar
on
had
mounted
the
stairs
and
sheepishly
presented
him
with
a
pair
of
white
mice
in
a
wooden
cage
jimmy
was
thrilled
the
cage
was
on
his
knees
all
evening
and
one
of
the
mice
was
clearly
ill
of
a
cake
with
pink
icing
the
portier
gift
was
a
stealthy
one
while
his
wife
was
having
coffee
with
her
cousin
the
brushmaker
but
the
spirit
of
christmas
does
strange
things
that
very
evening
while
the
portier
was
roistering
in
a
beer
hall
preparatory
to
the
midnight
mass
came
the
portier
wife
puffing
from
the
stairs
and
brought
a
puzzle
book
that
only
the
initiated
could
open
and
when
one
succeeded
at
last
there
was
a
picture
of
the
within
young
mclean
came
to
call
that
evening
came
to
call
and
remained
to
worship
it
was
the
first
time
since
boyer
that
a
visitor
had
come
mclean
interested
with
everything
and
palpably
not
shocked
was
a
comforting
caller
he
seemed
to
harmony
who
had
had
bad
moments
since
the
day
of
boyer
visit
to
put
the
hallmark
of
respectability
on
the
household
to
restore
it
to
something
it
had
lost
or
had
never
had
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
mclean
admiration
she
and
anna
put
jimmy
to
bed
the
tree
candles
were
burned
out
peter
was
extinguishing
the
dying
remnants
when
harmony
came
back
mclean
was
at
the
piano
thrumming
softly
peter
turning
round
suddenly
surprised
an
expression
on
the
younger
man
face
that
startled
him
for
that
one
night
harmony
had
laid
aside
her
mourning
and
wore
white
soft
white
tucked
in
at
the
neck
trailing
peter
had
never
seen
her
in
white
before
it
was
peter
way
to
sit
back
and
listen
his
steady
eyes
were
always
alert
but
he
talked
very
little
that
night
he
was
unusually
silent
he
sat
in
the
shadow
away
from
the
lamp
and
watched
the
two
at
the
piano
mclean
playing
a
bit
of
this
or
that
the
girl
bending
over
a
string
of
her
violin
anna
came
in
and
sat
down
near
him
the
boy
is
quite
fascinated
she
whispered
watch
his
eyes
he
is
a
nice
this
from
peter
as
if
he
argued
with
himself
as
men
go
this
was
a
challenge
peter
was
usually
quick
to
accept
that
night
he
only
smiled
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
her
his
people
are
money
always
money
peter
ground
his
teeth
over
his
pipestem
eminently
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
harmony
this
nice
boy
in
his
evening
clothes
who
spoke
harmony
own
language
of
music
who
was
almost
speechless
over
her
playing
and
who
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
in
which
admiration
was
not
unmixed
with
adoration
peter
was
restless
as
the
music
went
on
he
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
and
took
to
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
corridor
each
time
as
he
passed
the
door
he
tried
not
to
glance
in
each
time
he
paused
involuntarily
jealousy
had
her
will
of
him
that
night
jealousy
when
he
had
never
acknowledged
even
to
himself
how
much
the
girl
was
to
him
jimmy
was
restless
usually
harmony
music
put
him
to
sleep
but
that
night
he
lay
awake
even
after
peter
had
closed
all
the
doors
peter
came
in
and
sat
with
him
in
the
dark
going
over
now
and
then
to
cover
him
or
to
give
him
a
drink
or
to
pick
up
the
cage
of
mice
which
jimmy
insisted
on
having
beside
him
and
which
constantly
slipped
off
on
to
the
floor
after
a
time
peter
lighted
the
a
bit
of
wick
on
a
cork
floating
in
a
saucer
of
lard
oil
and
set
it
on
the
bedside
table
then
round
it
he
arranged
jimmy
treasures
the
deer
antlers
the
cage
of
mice
the
box
the
wooden
sentry
the
boy
fell
asleep
peter
sat
in
the
room
his
dead
pipe
in
his
teeth
and
thought
of
many
things
it
was
very
late
when
young
mclean
left
the
two
had
played
until
they
stopped
for
very
weariness
anna
had
yawned
herself
off
to
bed
from
jimmy
room
peter
could
hear
the
soft
hum
of
their
voices
you
have
been
awfully
good
to
me
mclean
said
as
he
finally
rose
to
go
i
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
never
forget
this
evening
it
has
been
splendid
has
it
since
little
scatchy
left
there
has
been
no
one
for
the
piano
i
have
been
lonely
sometimes
for
some
one
to
talk
music
lonely
poor
peter
then
you
will
let
me
come
back
will
i
indeed
i
i
be
how
soon
would
be
proper
i
dare
say
you
be
busy
christmas
and
all
do
you
mean
you
would
like
to
come
if
old
peter
would
be
fussed
he
might
think
peter
always
wants
every
one
to
be
happy
so
if
you
really
care
and
i
not
bore
you
rather
not
how
about
what
time
in
the
afternoon
would
be
pleasant
i
think
and
then
jimmy
can
listen
he
loves
mclean
having
found
his
coat
got
into
it
as
slowly
as
possible
then
he
missed
a
glove
and
it
must
be
searched
for
in
all
the
dark
corners
of
the
salon
until
found
in
his
pocket
even
then
he
hesitated
lingered
loath
to
break
up
this
little
world
of
two
you
play
wonderfully
he
said
so
do
if
only
something
comes
of
it
it
curious
is
it
when
you
think
of
it
you
and
i
meeting
here
in
the
center
of
europe
and
both
of
us
working
our
heads
off
for
something
that
may
never
pan
there
was
something
reminiscent
about
that
to
harmony
it
was
not
until
after
young
mclean
had
gone
that
she
recalled
it
was
almost
word
for
word
what
peter
had
said
to
her
in
the
the
night
they
met
she
thought
it
very
curious
the
coincidence
and
pondered
it
being
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
it
is
always
a
matter
for
wonder
when
the
man
meets
the
woman
no
matter
where
nothing
is
less
curious
more
inevitable
more
amazing
you
and
i
forsooth
said
peter
you
and
i
cried
young
mclean
chapter
xvi
quite
suddenly
peter
house
built
on
the
sand
collapsed
the
shock
came
on
after
young
mclean
now
frankly
infatuated
had
been
driven
home
by
peter
peter
did
it
after
his
own
fashion
harmony
with
unflagging
enthusiasm
was
looking
tired
suggestions
to
this
effect
rolled
off
mclean
back
like
rain
off
a
roof
finally
peter
gathered
up
the
coat
the
velours
hat
gloves
and
stick
and
placed
them
on
the
piano
in
front
of
the
younger
man
i
sorry
you
must
go
said
peter
calmly
but
as
you
say
miss
wells
is
tired
and
there
is
supper
to
be
eaten
do
let
me
hurry
the
portier
was
at
the
door
as
mclean
laughing
and
protesting
went
out
he
brought
a
cablegram
for
anna
peter
took
it
to
her
door
and
waited
uneasily
while
she
read
it
it
was
an
urgent
summons
home
the
old
father
was
very
low
he
was
calling
for
her
and
a
few
days
or
week
would
see
the
end
there
were
things
that
must
be
looked
after
the
need
of
her
was
imperative
with
the
death
the
old
man
pension
would
cease
and
anna
was
the
anna
held
the
paper
out
to
peter
and
sat
down
her
nervous
strength
seemed
to
have
deserted
her
all
at
once
she
was
a
stricken
elderly
woman
with
hope
wiped
out
of
her
face
and
something
nearer
resentment
than
grief
in
its
place
it
has
come
peter
she
said
dully
i
always
knew
it
could
last
they
always
hung
about
my
neck
and
now
do
you
think
you
must
go
is
there
some
way
if
things
are
so
bad
you
could
hardly
get
there
in
time
and
you
must
think
of
yourself
a
little
i
am
not
thinking
of
anything
else
peter
i
an
uncommonly
selfish
woman
but
i
quite
without
warning
she
burst
out
crying
unlovely
audible
weeping
that
shook
her
narrow
shoulders
harmony
heard
the
sound
and
joined
them
after
a
look
at
anna
she
sat
down
beside
her
and
put
a
white
arm
over
her
shoulders
she
did
not
try
to
speak
anna
noisy
grief
subsided
as
suddenly
as
it
came
she
patted
harmony
hand
in
mute
acknowledgment
and
dried
her
eyes
i
not
grieving
child
she
said
i
only
realizing
what
a
selfish
old
maid
i
am
i
crying
because
i
a
disappointment
to
myself
harry
i
going
back
to
and
that
after
hours
of
discussion
was
where
they
ended
anna
must
go
at
once
peter
must
keep
the
apartment
having
jimmy
to
look
after
and
to
hide
what
was
a
frightful
dilemma
to
him
and
to
harmony
anna
took
rather
lightly
you
find
some
one
else
to
take
my
place
she
said
if
i
had
a
day
i
could
find
a
and
in
the
interval
harmony
asked
without
looking
at
peter
the
interval
tut
peter
is
your
brother
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
if
you
are
thinking
of
who
will
know
having
determined
to
go
no
arguments
moved
anna
nor
could
either
of
the
two
think
of
anything
to
urge
beyond
a
situation
she
refused
to
see
or
rather
a
situation
she
refused
to
acknowledge
she
was
not
as
comfortable
as
she
pretended
during
all
that
long
night
while
snow
sifted
down
into
the
ugly
yard
and
made
it
beautiful
while
jimmy
slept
and
the
white
mice
played
while
harmony
tossed
and
tried
to
sleep
and
peter
sat
in
his
cold
room
and
smoked
his
pipe
anna
packed
her
untidy
belongings
and
added
a
name
now
and
then
to
a
list
that
was
meant
for
peter
a
list
of
possible
substitutes
for
herself
in
the
little
household
she
left
early
the
next
morning
a
grim
little
person
who
bent
over
the
sleeping
boy
hungrily
and
insisted
on
carrying
her
own
bag
down
the
stairs
harmony
did
not
go
to
the
station
but
stayed
at
home
pale
and
silent
hovering
around
against
jimmy
awakening
and
struggling
against
a
feeling
of
panic
not
that
she
feared
peter
or
herself
but
she
was
conventional
shielded
girls
are
accustomed
to
lean
for
a
certain
support
on
the
proprieties
as
bridgeplayers
depend
on
rules
peter
came
back
to
breakfast
but
ate
little
harmony
did
not
even
sit
down
but
drank
her
cup
of
coffee
standing
looking
down
at
the
snow
below
jimmy
still
slept
wo
you
sit
down
said
peter
i
not
hungry
thank
you
can
sit
down
without
peter
was
nervous
to
cover
his
uneasiness
he
was
distinctly
gruff
he
pulled
a
chair
out
for
her
and
she
sat
down
now
that
they
were
face
to
face
the
tension
was
lessened
peter
laid
anna
list
on
the
table
between
them
and
bent
over
it
toward
her
you
are
hurting
me
very
much
harry
he
said
do
you
know
why
i
i
am
only
sorry
about
anna
i
miss
her
i
i
was
fond
of
so
was
i
but
that
is
it
harry
it
something
i
uncomfortable
so
am
i
sorry
you
do
trust
me
for
that
not
at
all
but
peter
what
will
people
say
a
great
deal
if
they
know
who
is
to
know
how
many
people
know
about
us
a
handful
at
the
most
mclean
and
boyer
and
one
or
two
others
of
course
i
can
go
away
until
we
get
some
one
to
take
anna
place
but
you
be
here
alone
at
night
and
if
the
youngster
had
an
attack
oh
no
do
leave
him
it
holiday
time
there
are
no
clinics
until
next
week
if
you
put
up
with
me
put
up
with
you
when
it
is
your
apartment
i
use
your
food
i
eat
she
almost
choked
peter
i
must
talk
about
i
coming
to
that
do
you
suppose
you
more
than
earn
everything
does
it
humiliate
me
hourly
to
see
you
working
here
peter
would
you
rob
me
of
my
last
vestige
of
this
being
unanswerable
peter
fell
back
on
his
major
premise
if
you
put
up
with
me
for
a
day
or
so
i
take
this
list
of
and
hunt
up
some
body
just
describe
the
person
you
desire
and
i
find
he
assumed
a
certainty
he
was
far
from
feeling
but
it
reassured
the
girl
a
woman
of
course
of
course
and
not
young
wrote
peter
fat
harmony
recalled
boyer
ample
figure
and
shook
her
head
not
too
stout
and
agreeable
that
most
wrote
peter
although
anna
was
hardly
agreeable
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
was
she
she
was
interesting
and
and
wrote
peter
wanted
a
woman
not
young
not
too
stout
agreeable
and
human
shall
i
advertise
the
strain
was
quite
gone
by
that
time
harmony
was
smiling
jimmy
waking
called
for
food
and
the
morning
of
the
first
day
was
under
way
peter
was
well
content
that
morning
in
spite
of
an
undercurrent
of
uneasiness
before
this
anna
had
shared
his
proprietorship
with
him
now
the
little
household
was
his
his
vicarious
domesticity
pleased
him
he
strutted
about
taking
a
new
view
of
his
domain
he
tightened
a
doorknob
and
fastened
a
noisy
window
he
inspected
the
and
grumbled
over
its
quality
he
filled
the
copper
kettle
on
the
stove
carried
in
the
water
for
jimmy
morning
bath
cleaned
the
mouse
cage
he
even
insisted
on
peeling
the
little
german
potatoes
until
harmony
cried
aloud
at
his
wastefulness
and
took
the
knife
from
him
and
afterward
while
harmony
in
the
sickroom
read
aloud
and
jimmy
put
the
wooden
sentry
into
the
cage
to
keep
order
he
got
out
his
books
and
tried
to
study
but
he
did
little
work
his
book
lay
on
his
knee
his
pipe
died
beside
him
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
came
over
him
sitting
there
and
left
him
rather
frightened
he
tried
to
see
it
from
the
viewpoint
of
an
outsider
and
found
himself
incredulous
and
doubting
mclean
would
resent
the
situation
even
the
portier
was
a
person
to
reckon
with
the
skepticism
of
the
american
colony
was
a
thing
to
fear
and
avoid
and
over
all
hung
the
incessant
worry
about
money
he
could
just
manage
alone
he
could
not
by
any
method
he
knew
of
stretch
his
resources
to
cover
a
separate
arrangement
for
himself
but
he
had
undertaken
to
shield
a
and
a
child
and
shield
them
he
would
and
could
brave
thoughts
were
peter
that
snowy
morning
in
the
great
salon
of
maria
theresa
with
the
cat
of
the
portier
purring
before
the
fire
brave
thoughts
cool
reason
with
harmony
practicing
scales
very
softly
while
jimmy
slept
and
with
anna
speeding
through
a
white
world
to
the
accompaniment
of
bitter
meditation
peter
had
meant
to
go
to
semmering
that
day
but
even
the
urgency
of
marie
need
faded
before
his
own
situation
he
wired
stewart
that
he
would
come
as
soon
as
he
could
and
immediately
after
lunch
departed
for
the
club
anna
list
in
his
pocket
harmony
requirements
in
mind
he
paused
at
jimmy
door
on
his
way
out
what
shall
it
be
he
inquired
a
postcard
or
a
crayon
i
wish
i
could
have
a
we
have
a
dog
when
you
are
better
and
can
take
him
walking
wait
until
spring
some
more
mice
you
will
have
them
but
not
what
holiday
comes
next
new
year
day
suppose
i
bring
you
a
new
year
that
right
agreed
jimmy
one
i
can
send
to
dad
do
you
think
he
will
come
back
this
year
wistfully
peter
dropped
on
his
baggy
knees
beside
the
bed
and
drew
the
little
wasted
figure
to
him
i
think
you
surely
see
him
this
year
old
man
he
said
huskily
peter
walked
to
the
doctors
club
on
the
way
he
happened
on
little
georgiev
the
bulgarian
and
they
went
on
together
peter
managed
to
make
out
that
georgiev
was
studying
english
and
that
he
desired
to
know
the
state
of
health
and
the
abode
of
the
fraulein
wells
peter
evaded
the
latter
by
the
simple
expedient
of
pretending
not
to
understand
the
little
bulgarian
watched
him
earnestly
his
smouldering
eyes
not
without
suspicion
there
had
been
much
talk
in
the
pension
schwarz
about
the
departure
together
of
the
three
americans
the
jew
from
galicia
still
raved
over
harmony
beauty
georgiev
rather
hoped
by
staying
by
peter
to
be
led
toward
his
star
but
peter
left
him
at
the
doctors
club
still
amiable
but
absolutely
obtuse
to
the
question
nearest
the
little
spy
heart
the
club
was
almost
deserted
the
holidays
had
taken
many
of
the
members
out
of
town
other
men
were
taking
advantage
of
the
vacation
to
see
the
city
or
to
make
acquaintance
again
with
families
they
had
hardly
seen
during
the
busy
weeks
before
christmas
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
the
wives
of
the
members
were
apt
to
meet
for
chocolate
and
to
exchange
the
addresses
of
dressmakers
was
empty
in
the
reading
room
he
found
mclean
although
not
a
member
mclean
was
a
sort
of
honorary
habitue
being
allowed
the
privilege
of
the
club
in
exchange
for
a
dependable
willingness
to
play
at
entertainments
of
all
sorts
it
was
in
peter
mind
to
enlist
mclean
assistance
in
his
difficulties
mclean
knew
a
good
many
people
he
was
popular
goodlooking
and
in
a
colony
where
unlike
london
and
paris
the
great
majority
were
people
of
moderate
means
he
was
conspicuously
well
off
but
he
was
also
much
younger
than
peter
and
intolerant
with
the
insolence
of
youth
peter
was
thinking
hard
as
he
took
off
his
overcoat
and
ordered
beer
the
boy
was
in
love
with
harmony
already
peter
had
seen
that
as
he
saw
many
things
how
far
his
love
might
carry
him
peter
had
no
idea
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
sat
across
the
and
studied
him
over
his
magazine
that
mclean
would
resent
bitterly
the
girl
position
and
that
when
he
learned
it
a
crisis
might
be
precipitated
one
of
three
things
might
happen
he
might
bend
all
his
energies
to
second
peter
effort
to
fill
anna
place
to
find
the
right
person
he
might
suggest
taking
anna
place
himself
and
insist
that
his
presence
in
the
apartment
would
be
as
justifiable
as
peter
or
he
might
do
at
once
the
thing
peter
felt
he
would
do
eventually
cut
the
knot
of
the
difficulty
by
asking
harmony
to
marry
him
peter
greeting
him
pleasantly
decided
not
to
tell
him
anything
to
keep
him
away
if
possible
until
the
thing
was
straightened
out
and
to
wait
for
an
hour
at
the
club
in
the
hope
that
a
solution
might
stroll
in
for
chocolate
and
gossip
in
any
event
explanation
to
mclean
would
have
required
justification
peter
disliked
the
idea
he
could
humble
himself
if
necessary
to
a
woman
he
could
admit
his
asininity
in
assuming
the
responsibility
of
jimmy
for
instance
and
any
woman
worthy
of
the
name
or
worthy
of
living
in
the
house
with
harmony
would
understand
but
mclean
was
young
intolerant
he
was
more
than
that
though
peter
concealing
from
himself
just
what
harmony
meant
to
him
would
not
have
admitted
a
rival
for
what
he
had
never
claimed
but
a
rival
the
boy
was
peter
calmly
reading
a
magazine
and
drinking
his
munich
beer
was
in
the
grip
of
the
fiercest
jealousy
he
turned
pages
automatically
to
recall
nothing
of
what
he
had
read
mclean
sitting
across
from
him
watched
him
surreptitiously
big
peter
aggressively
masculine
heavy
of
shoulder
direct
of
speech
and
eye
was
to
him
the
embodiment
of
all
that
a
woman
should
desire
in
a
man
he
too
was
jealous
but
humbly
so
unlike
peter
he
knew
his
situation
was
young
enough
to
glory
in
it
shameless
love
is
always
young
with
years
comes
discretion
perhaps
loss
of
confidence
the
crusaders
were
youths
pursuing
an
idea
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
flaunting
a
guerdon
from
spear
or
the
older
men
among
them
tucked
the
handkerchief
or
bit
of
a
gauntleted
glove
under
jerkin
and
armor
near
the
heart
and
flung
to
the
air
the
guerdon
of
some
light
o
love
mclean
would
have
shouted
harmony
name
from
the
housetops
peter
did
not
acknowledge
even
to
himself
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
it
occurred
to
mclean
after
a
time
that
peter
being
in
the
club
and
harmony
being
in
all
probability
at
home
it
might
be
possible
to
see
her
alone
for
a
few
minutes
he
had
not
intended
to
go
back
to
the
house
in
the
siebensternstrasse
so
soon
after
being
peremptorily
put
out
he
had
come
to
the
club
with
the
intention
of
clinching
his
resolution
with
a
game
of
cribbage
but
fate
was
playing
into
his
hands
there
was
no
cribbage
player
round
and
peter
himself
sat
across
deeply
immersed
in
a
magazine
mclean
rose
not
stealthily
but
without
unnecessary
noise
so
far
so
good
peter
turned
a
page
and
went
on
reading
mclean
sauntered
to
a
window
hands
in
pockets
he
even
whistled
a
trifle
under
his
breath
to
prove
how
very
casual
were
his
intentions
still
whistling
he
moved
toward
the
door
peter
turned
another
page
which
was
curiously
soon
to
have
read
two
columns
of
small
type
without
illustrations
once
out
in
the
hall
mclean
movements
gained
aim
and
precision
he
got
his
coat
hat
and
stick
flung
the
first
over
his
arm
and
the
second
on
his
head
and
going
out
asked
peter
calmly
yes
nothing
to
do
here
i
read
all
the
infernal
old
magazines
until
i
sick
of
indignant
too
from
his
tone
walking
mind
if
i
go
with
you
not
at
peter
taking
down
his
old
overcoat
from
its
hook
turned
and
caught
the
boy
eye
it
was
a
swift
exchange
of
glances
but
illuminating
whimsical
but
with
a
sort
of
grim
determination
mclean
sheepish
but
equally
determined
rotten
afternoon
said
mclean
as
they
started
for
the
stairs
half
rain
half
snow
streets
are
i
not
particularly
keen
about
walking
but
i
do
care
for
this
tomb
nothing
was
further
from
mclean
mind
than
a
walk
with
peter
that
afternoon
he
hesitated
halfway
down
the
upper
flight
you
do
care
for
cribbage
do
you
do
know
anything
about
it
how
about
pinochle
they
had
both
stopped
equally
determined
equally
hesitating
pinochle
it
is
acquiesced
mclean
i
was
only
going
because
there
was
nothing
to
things
went
very
well
for
peter
that
afternoon
up
to
a
certain
point
he
beat
mclean
unmercifully
playing
with
cold
deliberation
mclean
wearied
fidgeted
railed
at
his
luck
peter
played
on
grimly
the
club
filled
up
toward
the
two
or
three
women
wives
of
members
a
young
girl
to
whom
mclean
had
been
rather
attentive
before
he
met
harmony
and
who
bridled
at
the
abstracted
bow
he
gave
her
and
finally
when
hope
in
peter
was
dead
one
of
the
women
on
anna
list
peter
laying
down
pairs
and
marking
up
score
went
over
requirements
jennings
seemed
to
fit
them
all
a
woman
not
young
not
too
stout
agreeable
and
human
she
was
a
large
almost
bovinely
placid
person
not
at
all
reminiscent
of
anna
she
was
neat
where
anna
had
been
disorderly
well
dressed
and
breezy
against
anna
dowdiness
and
sharpness
peter
having
totaled
the
score
rose
and
looked
down
at
mclean
you
a
nice
lad
he
said
smiling
sometime
i
shall
teach
you
the
how
about
a
lesson
in
street
why
i
sorry
we
have
an
engagement
for
the
we
was
deliberate
and
cruel
mclean
writhed
also
the
statement
was
false
but
the
boy
was
spared
that
knowledge
for
the
moment
things
went
well
jennings
was
badly
off
for
quarters
she
would
make
a
change
if
she
could
better
herself
peter
drew
her
off
to
a
corner
and
stated
his
case
she
listened
attentively
albeit
not
without
disapproval
she
frankly
discredited
the
altruism
of
peter
motives
when
he
told
her
about
harmony
but
as
the
recital
went
on
she
found
herself
rather
touched
the
story
of
jimmy
appealed
to
her
she
scolded
and
lauded
peter
in
one
breath
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
she
promised
to
visit
the
house
in
the
siebensternstrasse
the
next
day
so
anna
gates
has
gone
home
she
reflected
when
this
then
the
girl
is
there
alone
yes
she
is
very
young
and
inexperienced
and
the
boy
myocarditis
she
afraid
to
be
left
with
is
she
quite
alone
absolutely
and
without
funds
except
enough
for
her
lessons
our
arrangement
was
that
she
should
keep
the
house
going
that
was
her
jennings
was
impressed
it
was
impossible
to
talk
to
peter
and
not
believe
him
women
trusted
peter
always
you
been
very
foolish
byrne
she
said
as
she
rose
but
been
disinterested
enough
to
offset
that
and
to
put
some
of
us
to
shame
at
three
if
it
suits
you
you
said
the
siebensternstrasse
peter
went
home
exultant
chapter
xvii
had
had
a
softening
effect
on
boyer
it
had
opened
badly
it
was
the
first
christmas
she
had
spent
away
from
her
children
and
there
had
been
little
of
the
holiday
spirit
in
her
attitude
as
she
prepared
the
christmas
breakfast
after
that
however
things
happened
in
the
first
place
under
her
plate
she
had
found
a
frivolous
chain
and
pendant
which
she
had
admired
and
when
her
eyes
filled
up
as
they
did
whenever
she
was
emotionally
moved
the
doctor
had
come
round
the
table
and
put
both
his
arms
about
her
too
young
for
you
not
a
bit
he
said
heartily
you
then
you
ever
were
jennie
and
if
you
were
you
the
only
woman
for
me
anyhow
do
you
think
i
realize
what
this
exile
means
to
you
and
that
you
doing
it
for
me
i
i
do
mind
yes
you
do
we
go
out
and
make
a
night
of
it
shall
we
supper
at
the
grand
the
theater
and
then
the
tabarin
eh
she
loosened
herself
from
his
arms
what
shall
i
wear
those
horrible
things
the
children
bought
me
throw
they
not
worn
at
throw
them
out
get
rid
of
the
things
the
children
got
you
go
out
and
buy
something
you
like
not
that
i
do
like
you
in
anything
or
without
frank
be
happy
that
the
thing
it
the
first
christmas
without
the
family
and
i
miss
them
too
but
we
together
dear
that
the
big
thing
merry
an
auspicious
opening
that
to
and
they
had
carried
out
the
program
as
outlined
boyer
had
enjoyed
it
albeit
a
bit
horrified
at
the
christmas
gayety
at
the
tabarin
the
next
morning
however
she
awakened
with
a
keen
reaction
her
head
ached
she
had
a
sense
of
taint
over
her
she
was
virtue
rampant
again
as
on
the
day
she
had
first
visited
the
old
lodge
in
the
siebensternstrasse
it
is
hardly
astonishing
that
by
association
of
ideas
harmony
came
into
her
mind
again
a
brand
that
might
even
yet
be
snatched
from
the
burning
she
had
been
a
bit
hasty
before
she
admitted
to
herself
there
was
a
woman
doctor
named
gates
although
her
address
at
the
club
was
given
as
pension
schwarz
she
determined
to
do
her
shopping
early
and
then
to
visit
the
house
in
the
siebensternstrasse
she
was
not
a
hard
woman
for
all
her
inflexible
morality
and
more
than
once
she
had
had
an
uneasy
memory
of
harmony
bewildered
almost
stricken
face
the
afternoon
of
her
visit
she
had
been
a
watchful
mother
over
a
not
particularly
handsome
family
of
daughters
this
lovely
young
girl
needed
mothering
and
she
had
refused
it
she
would
go
back
and
if
she
found
she
had
been
wrong
and
the
girl
was
deserving
and
honest
she
would
see
what
could
be
done
the
day
was
wretched
the
snow
had
turned
to
rain
boyer
shopping
dragged
wet
skirts
and
damp
feet
from
store
to
store
she
found
nothing
that
she
cared
for
after
all
the
garments
that
looked
chic
in
the
windows
or
on
manikins
in
the
shops
were
absurd
on
her
her
insistent
bosom
bulged
straight
lines
became
curves
or
tortuous
zigzags
plackets
gaped
collars
choked
her
or
shocked
her
by
their
absence
in
the
mirror
of
marie
jedlicka
clad
in
familiar
garments
that
had
accommodated
themselves
to
the
idiosyncrasies
of
her
figure
boyer
was
a
plump
rather
comely
matron
here
before
the
plate
glass
of
the
modiste
under
the
glare
of
a
hundred
lights
side
by
side
with
a
slim
austrian
girl
who
looked
like
a
willow
wand
boyer
was
grotesque
ridiculous
monstrous
she
shuddered
she
almost
wept
it
was
bad
preparation
for
a
visit
to
the
siebensternstrasse
boyer
finding
her
vanity
gone
convinced
that
she
was
an
absurdity
physically
fell
back
for
comfort
on
her
soul
she
had
been
a
good
wife
and
mother
she
was
chaste
righteous
god
had
been
cruel
to
her
in
the
flesh
but
he
had
given
her
the
spirit
madame
wishes
not
the
gown
it
is
beautiful
see
the
embroidery
and
the
neck
may
be
filled
with
young
woman
she
said
grimly
i
see
the
embroidery
and
the
neck
may
be
filled
with
chiffon
but
not
for
me
and
when
you
have
had
five
children
you
will
not
buy
clothes
like
that
all
the
kindliness
was
gone
from
the
visit
to
the
siebensternstrasse
only
the
determination
remained
wounded
to
the
heart
of
her
her
pride
in
tatters
she
took
her
way
to
the
old
lodge
and
climbed
the
stairs
she
found
a
condition
of
mild
excitement
jimmy
had
slept
long
after
his
bath
harmony
practiced
cut
up
a
chicken
for
broth
aired
blankets
for
the
chair
into
which
peter
on
his
return
was
to
lift
the
boy
she
was
called
to
inspect
the
which
according
to
jimmy
had
strawberries
in
it
far
back
he
explained
there
in
the
cotton
but
it
was
not
strawberries
harmony
opened
the
cage
and
very
tenderly
took
out
the
cotton
nest
eight
tiny
pink
baby
mice
clean
washed
by
the
mother
lay
curled
in
a
heap
it
was
a
stupendous
moment
the
joy
of
vicarious
parentage
was
jimmy
he
named
them
all
immediately
and
demanded
food
for
them
on
delicate
explanation
that
this
was
unnecessary
life
took
on
a
new
meaning
for
jimmy
he
watched
the
mother
lest
she
slight
one
his
responsibility
weighed
on
him
also
his
inquiring
mind
was
very
busy
but
how
did
they
get
there
he
demanded
god
sent
them
just
as
he
sends
babies
of
all
did
he
send
me
of
that
a
good
one
on
you
harry
my
father
found
me
in
a
hollow
but
do
you
think
god
had
something
to
do
with
it
jimmy
pondered
this
i
suppose
he
reflected
god
sent
daddy
to
find
me
so
that
i
would
be
his
little
boy
you
never
happened
to
see
any
babies
when
you
were
out
walking
did
you
harry
not
in
stumps
but
i
probably
was
jimmy
eyed
her
with
sympathy
you
may
some
day
would
you
like
to
have
one
very
much
said
harmony
and
flushed
delightfully
jimmy
was
disposed
to
press
the
matter
to
urge
immediate
maternity
on
her
you
could
lay
it
here
on
the
bed
he
offered
and
i
watch
it
when
they
yell
you
let
suck
your
finger
i
knew
a
woman
once
that
had
a
baby
and
she
did
that
and
it
could
watch
isabella
was
the
mother
mouse
and
when
i
better
i
could
take
it
that
said
harmony
gravely
is
mighty
fine
of
you
jimmy
boy
i
think
about
she
never
denied
jimmy
anything
so
now
she
temporized
i
ask
harmony
had
a
moment
then
would
it
be
better
she
asked
to
keep
anything
of
that
sort
a
secret
and
to
surprise
peter
the
boy
loved
a
secret
he
played
with
it
in
lieu
of
other
occupation
his
uncertain
future
was
sown
thick
with
secrets
that
would
never
flower
into
reality
thus
peter
had
shamelessly
promised
him
a
visit
to
the
circus
when
he
was
able
to
go
harmony
not
to
be
told
until
the
tickets
were
bought
anna
had
similarly
promised
to
send
him
from
america
a
pitcher
glove
and
a
baseball
bat
to
this
list
of
futurities
he
now
added
harmony
baby
harmony
brought
in
her
violin
and
played
softly
to
him
not
to
disturb
the
sleeping
mice
she
sang
too
a
verse
that
the
big
soprano
had
been
fond
of
and
that
jimmy
loved
not
much
of
a
voice
was
harmony
but
sweet
and
low
and
very
true
as
became
her
violinist
ear
ah
well
for
us
all
some
sweet
hope
lies
deeply
buried
from
human
eyes
she
sang
her
clear
eyes
luminous
and
in
the
hereafter
angels
may
roll
the
stone
from
its
grave
away
boyer
mounted
the
stairs
she
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
she
had
snagged
her
skirt
on
a
nail
in
the
old
gate
and
although
that
very
morning
she
had
detested
the
suit
her
round
of
shopping
had
again
endeared
it
to
her
she
told
the
portier
in
english
what
she
thought
of
him
and
climbed
ponderously
pausing
at
each
landing
to
examine
the
damage
harmony
having
sung
jimmy
to
sleep
was
in
the
throes
of
an
experiment
she
was
trying
to
smoke
a
very
human
young
person
was
harmony
apt
to
be
exceedingly
wretched
if
her
hat
were
of
last
year
fashion
anxious
to
be
inconspicuous
by
doing
what
every
one
else
was
doing
conventional
as
are
the
very
young
fearful
of
being
an
exception
and
nearly
every
one
was
smoking
many
of
the
young
women
whom
she
met
at
the
master
house
had
yellowed
fingers
and
smoked
in
the
anteroom
the
big
soprano
had
smoked
anna
and
scatchy
had
smoked
in
the
milliners
apprentices
produced
little
silver
to
prevent
soiling
their
pretty
lips
and
smoked
endlessly
even
peter
had
admitted
that
it
was
not
a
vice
but
only
a
comfortable
bad
habit
and
anna
had
left
a
handful
of
cigarettes
harmony
was
not
smoking
she
was
experimenting
peter
and
anna
had
smoked
together
and
it
had
looked
comradely
perhaps
without
reasoning
it
out
harmony
was
experimenting
toward
the
end
of
establishing
her
relations
with
peter
still
further
on
friendly
and
comradely
grounds
two
men
might
smoke
together
a
man
and
a
woman
might
smoke
together
as
friends
according
to
harmony
ideas
a
girl
paring
potatoes
might
inspire
sentiment
but
smoking
a
cigarette
never
she
did
not
like
it
she
thought
standing
before
her
little
mirror
that
she
looked
fast
after
all
she
tried
pursing
her
lips
together
as
she
had
seen
anna
do
and
blowing
out
the
smoke
in
a
thin
line
she
smoked
very
hard
so
that
she
stood
in
the
center
of
a
gray
nimbus
she
hated
it
but
she
persisted
perhaps
it
grew
on
one
perhaps
also
if
she
walked
about
it
would
choke
her
less
she
practiced
holding
the
thing
between
her
first
and
second
fingers
and
found
that
easier
than
smoking
then
she
went
to
the
salon
where
there
was
more
air
and
tried
exhaling
through
her
nose
it
made
her
sneeze
on
the
sneeze
came
boyer
ring
harmony
thought
very
fast
it
might
be
the
bread
or
the
milk
but
again
she
flung
the
cigarette
into
the
stove
shut
the
door
and
answered
the
bell
boyer
greeting
was
colder
than
she
had
intended
it
put
harmony
on
the
defensive
at
once
made
her
uncomfortable
like
all
the
innocent
falsely
accused
she
looked
guiltier
than
the
guiltiest
under
boyer
searching
eyes
the
enormity
of
her
situation
overwhelmed
her
and
over
all
through
salon
and
passage
hung
the
damning
odor
of
the
cigarette
harmony
leading
the
way
in
was
a
sheep
before
her
shearer
i
calling
on
all
of
you
said
boyer
sniping
i
meant
to
bring
boyer
cards
for
every
one
including
i
sorry
byrne
is
and
gates
she
she
is
boyer
raised
her
eyebrows
and
ostentatiously
changed
the
subject
requesting
a
needle
and
thread
to
draw
the
rent
together
it
had
been
in
harmony
mind
to
explain
the
situation
to
show
jimmy
to
boyer
to
throw
herself
on
the
older
woman
sympathy
to
ask
advice
but
the
visitor
attitude
made
this
difficult
to
add
to
her
discomfort
through
the
grating
in
the
stove
door
was
coming
a
thin
thread
of
smoke
it
was
after
all
boyer
who
broached
the
subject
again
she
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
harmony
sitting
on
a
stool
had
mended
the
rent
so
that
it
could
hardly
be
seen
boyer
softened
by
the
tea
and
by
the
proximity
of
harmony
lovely
head
bent
over
her
task
grew
slightly
more
expansive
i
ought
to
tell
you
something
miss
wells
she
said
you
remember
my
other
visit
harmony
bent
still
lower
i
did
you
an
injustice
at
that
time
i
been
sorry
ever
since
i
thought
that
there
was
no
gates
i
sorry
but
i
not
going
to
deny
it
people
do
things
in
this
wicked
city
that
they
would
do
at
home
i
confess
i
misjudged
peter
byrne
you
can
give
him
my
apologies
since
he
wo
see
but
he
is
here
or
of
course
he
see
then
demanded
boyer
grimly
if
peter
byrne
is
not
here
who
has
been
smoking
cigarettes
in
this
room
there
is
one
still
burning
in
that
stove
harmony
hand
was
forced
she
was
white
as
she
cut
the
thread
and
rose
to
her
feet
i
think
she
said
that
i
better
go
back
a
few
weeks
boyer
and
tell
you
a
story
if
you
have
time
to
if
it
is
disagreeable
not
at
all
it
is
about
peter
byrne
and
myself
and
some
others
it
is
really
about
peter
boyer
will
you
come
very
quietly
across
the
hall
boyer
expecting
heaven
knows
what
rose
with
celerity
harmony
led
the
way
to
jimmy
door
and
opened
it
he
was
still
asleep
a
wasted
small
figure
on
the
narrow
bed
beside
him
the
mice
frolicked
in
their
cage
the
sentry
kept
guard
over
peter
shameless
letters
from
the
tyrol
the
strawberry
babies
wriggled
in
their
cotton
we
are
not
going
to
have
him
very
long
said
harmony
softly
peter
is
making
him
happy
for
a
little
back
in
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
she
told
the
whole
story
boyer
found
it
very
affecting
harmony
sat
beside
her
on
a
stool
and
she
kept
her
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
when
the
narrative
reached
going
away
however
she
took
it
away
from
that
point
on
she
sat
uncompromisingly
rigid
and
listened
then
you
mean
to
say
she
exploded
when
harmony
had
finished
that
you
intend
to
stay
on
here
just
the
two
of
you
and
bah
what
has
the
child
to
do
with
it
we
will
find
some
one
to
take
anna
i
doubt
it
and
until
you
do
there
is
nothing
wicked
in
what
we
are
doing
do
you
see
boyer
i
ca
leave
the
since
peter
is
so
altruistic
let
him
hire
a
bad
as
things
were
harmony
smiled
a
nurse
she
said
why
do
you
realize
that
he
is
keeping
three
people
now
on
what
is
starvation
for
one
then
he
a
fool
boyer
rose
in
majesty
i
not
going
to
leave
you
i
sorry
you
must
see
i
see
nothing
but
a
girl
deliberately
putting
herself
in
a
compromising
portion
and
mrs
boyer
get
your
things
on
i
guess
boyer
and
i
can
look
after
you
until
we
can
send
you
i
am
not
going
home
yet
said
poor
harmony
biting
her
lip
to
steady
it
back
and
forth
waged
the
battle
boyer
assailing
harmony
offering
little
defense
but
standing
firm
on
her
refusal
to
go
as
long
as
peter
would
let
her
remain
it
means
so
much
to
me
she
ventured
goaded
and
i
earn
my
lodging
and
board
i
work
hard
and
i
make
him
comfortable
it
costs
him
very
little
and
i
give
him
something
in
exchange
all
men
are
not
alike
if
the
sort
you
have
known
are
are
different
this
was
unfortunate
boyer
stiffened
she
ceased
offensive
tactics
and
retired
grimly
into
the
dignity
of
her
high
calling
of
virtuous
wife
and
mother
she
washed
her
hands
of
harmony
and
peter
she
tied
on
her
veil
with
shaking
hands
and
prepared
to
leave
harmony
to
her
fate
give
me
your
mother
address
she
demanded
certainly
you
absolutely
refuse
to
save
yourself
from
what
from
peter
there
are
many
worse
people
than
peter
to
save
myself
from
boyer
uncharitable
people
and
and
cruel
boyer
shrugged
her
plump
shoulders
meaning
me
she
retorted
my
dear
child
people
are
always
cruel
who
try
to
save
us
from
unluckily
for
harmony
one
of
anna
specious
arguments
must
pop
into
her
head
at
that
instant
and
demand
expression
people
are
living
their
own
lives
these
days
boyer
old
standards
have
gone
it
is
what
one
conscience
condemns
that
is
wrong
it
not
merely
breaking
laws
that
were
made
to
fit
the
average
not
the
anna
anna
boyer
flung
up
her
hands
you
are
impossible
she
snapped
after
all
i
believe
it
is
peter
who
needs
protection
i
shall
speak
to
she
started
down
the
staircase
but
turned
for
a
parting
volley
and
just
a
word
of
advice
perhaps
the
old
standards
have
gone
but
if
you
really
expect
to
find
a
respectable
woman
to
chaperon
you
keep
your
views
to
harmony
a
bruised
and
wounded
thing
crept
into
jimmy
room
and
sank
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
one
small
hand
lay
on
the
coverlet
she
dared
not
touch
it
for
fear
of
waking
him
but
she
laid
her
cheek
close
to
it
for
comfort
when
peter
came
in
much
later
he
found
the
boy
wide
awake
and
harmony
asleep
a
crumpled
heap
beside
the
bed
i
think
she
been
crying
jimmy
whispered
she
been
sobbing
in
her
sleep
and
strike
a
match
peter

may
be
more
chapter
xviii
boyer
bursting
with
indignation
went
to
the
doctors
club
it
was
typical
of
the
way
things
were
going
with
peter
that
boyer
was
not
there
and
that
the
only
woman
in
the
clubrooms
should
be
jennings
young
mclean
was
in
the
reading
room
eating
his
heart
out
with
jealousy
of
peter
vacillating
between
the
desire
to
see
harmony
that
night
and
fear
lest
peter
forbid
him
the
house
permanently
if
he
made
the
attempt
he
had
found
a
picture
of
the
fraulein
engel
from
the
opera
in
a
magazine
and
was
sitting
with
it
open
before
him
very
deeply
and
really
in
love
was
mclean
that
afternoon
and
the
fraulein
engel
and
harmony
were
not
unlike
the
double
doors
between
the
reading
room
and
the
reception
room
adjoining
were
open
mclean
lost
in
a
rosy
future
in
which
he
and
harmony
sat
together
for
indefinite
periods
with
no
peter
to
scowl
over
his
books
at
them
a
future
in
which
life
was
one
long
duo
with
the
candles
in
the
chandelier
going
out
one
by
one
leaving
them
at
last
alone
in
scented
darkness
together
mclean
heard
nothing
until
the
mention
of
the
siebensternstrasse
roused
him
after
that
he
listened
he
heard
that
jennings
was
contemplating
taking
anna
place
at
the
lodge
and
he
comprehended
after
a
moment
that
anna
was
already
gone
even
then
the
significance
of
the
situation
was
a
little
time
in
dawning
on
him
when
it
did
however
he
rose
with
a
stifled
oath
boyer
was
speaking
it
is
exactly
as
i
tell
you
she
was
saying
if
peter
byrne
is
trying
to
protect
her
reputation
he
is
late
doing
it
personally
i
have
been
there
twice
i
never
saw
anna
gates
and
she
is
registered
here
at
the
club
as
living
in
the
pension
schwarz
whatever
the
facts
may
be
one
thing
remains
she
is
not
there
mclean
waited
to
hear
no
more
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
he
found
a
comfortable
at
the
curb
the
driver
was
asleep
inside
the
carriage
mclean
dragged
him
out
by
the
shoulder
and
shouted
an
address
to
him
the
cab
bumped
along
over
the
rough
streets
to
an
accompaniment
of
protests
from
its
frantic
passenger
the
boy
was
with
wrath
and
fear
peter
silence
that
afternoon
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
loomed
large
and
significant
he
had
thought
once
or
twice
that
peter
was
in
love
with
harmony
he
knew
it
now
in
the
clearer
vision
of
the
moment
he
recalled
things
that
maddened
him
the
dozen
intimacies
of
the
little
menage
the
caress
in
peter
voice
when
he
spoke
to
the
girl
peter
steady
eyes
in
the
of
the
salon
while
harmony
played
at
a
corner
they
must
pause
for
the
inevitable
regiment
mclean
cursed
bending
out
to
see
how
long
the
delay
would
be
peter
had
been
gone
for
half
an
hour
perhaps
but
peter
would
walk
if
he
could
only
see
the
girl
first
talk
to
her
tell
her
what
she
would
be
doing
by
remaining
he
was
there
at
last
flinging
across
the
courtyard
like
a
madman
peter
was
already
there
his
footprints
were
fresh
in
the
slush
of
the
path
the
house
door
was
closed
but
not
locked
mclean
ran
up
the
stairs
it
was
barely
twilight
outside
but
the
staircase
well
was
dark
at
the
upper
landing
he
was
compelled
to
fumble
for
the
bell
peter
admitted
him
the
corridor
was
unlighted
but
from
the
salon
came
a
glow
of
lamplight
mclean
out
of
breath
and
furious
faced
peter
i
want
to
see
harmony
he
said
without
preface
peter
eyed
him
he
knew
what
had
happened
had
expected
it
when
the
bell
rang
had
anticipated
it
when
harmony
told
him
of
boyer
visit
in
the
second
between
the
peal
of
the
bell
and
his
opening
the
door
he
had
decided
what
to
do
come
mclean
stepped
inside
he
was
smaller
than
peter
not
so
much
shorter
as
slenderer
even
peter
winced
before
the
look
in
his
eyes
where
is
she
in
the
kitchen
i
think
come
into
the
mclean
flung
off
his
coat
peter
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
just
inside
he
had
his
pipe
as
usual
i
came
to
see
her
not
you
so
i
gather
i
let
you
see
her
of
course
but
do
you
want
to
see
me
first
i
want
to
take
her
away
from
why
are
you
better
able
to
care
for
her
than
i
am
mclean
stood
rigid
he
had
thrust
his
clenched
hands
into
his
pockets
you
a
scoundrel
byrne
he
said
steadily
why
did
you
tell
me
this
this
afternoon
because
i
knew
if
i
did
you
do
just
what
you
are
are
you
going
to
keep
her
here
peter
changed
color
at
the
thrust
but
he
kept
himself
in
hand
i
not
keeping
her
here
he
said
patiently
i
doing
the
best
i
can
under
the
then
your
best
is
pretty
perhaps
if
you
would
try
to
remember
the
circumstances
mclean
that
the
girl
has
no
place
else
to
go
practically
no
money
and
that
i
i
remember
one
circumstance
that
you
are
living
here
alone
with
her
and
that
you
crazy
in
love
with
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
as
long
as
i
treat
her
bah
will
you
be
good
enough
to
let
me
finish
what
i
am
trying
to
say
safe
with
me
when
i
say
that
i
mean
it
she
will
not
go
away
from
here
with
you
or
with
any
one
else
if
i
can
prevent
it
and
if
you
care
enough
about
her
to
try
to
keep
her
happy
you
not
let
her
know
you
have
been
here
i
got
a
woman
coming
to
take
anna
place
that
ought
to
satisfy
dr
jennings
she
not
come
boyer
has
been
talking
to
her
inside
of
an
hour
the
whole
club
will
have
it
every
american
in
vienna
will
know
about
it
in
a
day
or
so
i
tell
you
byrne
you
doing
an
awful
peter
drew
a
long
breath
he
had
had
his
bad
before
mclean
came
had
had
to
stand
by
wordless
and
see
harmony
trying
to
smile
see
her
dragging
about
languid
and
white
see
her
tragic
attempts
to
greet
him
on
the
old
familiar
footing
through
it
all
he
had
been
sustained
by
the
thought
that
a
day
or
two
days
would
see
the
old
footing
reestablished
another
woman
in
the
house
life
again
worth
the
living
and
harmony
smiling
up
frankly
into
his
eyes
now
this
hope
had
departed
you
ca
keep
me
from
seeing
her
you
know
mclean
persisted
got
to
put
this
thing
to
her
she
got
to
what
alternative
have
you
to
suggest
i
marry
her
if
she
have
after
all
peter
had
expected
that
and
if
she
cared
for
the
boy
would
that
be
best
for
her
what
had
he
to
offer
against
that
he
could
marry
he
could
only
offer
her
shelter
against
everything
else
even
then
he
did
not
dislike
mclean
he
was
a
man
every
slender
inch
of
him
this
boy
musician
peter
heart
sank
but
he
put
down
his
pipe
and
turned
to
the
door
i
call
her
he
said
but
since
this
concerns
me
very
vitally
i
should
like
to
be
here
while
you
put
the
thing
to
her
after
that
if
you
like
he
called
harmony
she
had
given
jimmy
his
supper
and
was
carrying
out
a
tray
that
seemed
hardly
touched
he
wo
eat
she
said
miserably
peter
if
he
stops
eating
what
can
we
do
he
is
so
weak
peter
took
the
tray
from
her
gently
harry
dear
he
said
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
salon
some
one
wishes
to
speak
to
to
me
yes
harry
do
you
remember
that
evening
in
the
kitchen
when
do
you
recall
what
i
promised
yes
you
are
sure
you
know
what
i
mean
that
all
right
then
mclean
wants
to
see
she
hesitated
looking
up
at
him
mclean
you
look
so
grave
peter
what
is
it
he
will
tell
you
nothing
peter
gave
mclean
a
minute
alone
after
all
while
he
carried
the
tray
to
the
kitchen
he
had
no
desire
to
play
watchdog
over
the
girl
he
told
himself
savagely
only
to
keep
himself
straight
with
her
and
to
save
her
from
mclean
impetuosity
he
even
waited
in
the
kitchen
to
fill
and
light
his
pipe
mclean
had
worked
himself
into
a
very
fair
passion
he
was
intense
almost
theatrical
as
he
stood
with
folded
arms
waiting
for
harmony
so
entirely
did
the
girl
fill
his
existence
that
he
forgot
or
did
not
care
to
remember
how
short
a
time
he
had
known
her
as
harmony
she
dominated
his
life
and
his
thoughts
as
harmony
he
addressed
her
when
rather
startled
she
entered
the
salon
and
stood
just
inside
the
closed
door
peter
said
you
wanted
to
speak
to
mclean
groaned
peter
he
said
it
is
always
peter
look
here
harmony
you
can
not
stay
it
is
only
for
a
few
hours
some
one
is
coming
and
anyhow
peter
is
going
to
semmering
we
know
it
is
unusual
but
what
can
we
do
unusual
it
it
damnable
it
the
appearance
of
the
thing
you
see
that
i
think
it
is
rather
silly
to
talk
of
appearance
when
there
is
no
one
to
care
and
how
can
i
leave
jimmy
needs
me
all
the
time
that
another
idiocy
of
peter
what
does
he
mean
by
putting
you
in
this
position
i
am
one
of
peter
peter
entered
on
that
he
took
in
the
situation
with
a
glance
and
harmony
turned
to
him
but
if
she
had
expected
peter
to
support
her
she
was
disappointed
whatever
decision
she
was
to
make
must
be
her
own
in
peter
troubled
mind
he
crossed
the
room
and
stood
at
one
of
the
windows
looking
out
a
passive
participant
in
the
scene
the
day
had
been
a
trying
one
for
harmony
what
she
chose
to
consider
peter
defection
was
a
fresh
stab
she
glanced
from
mclean
flushed
and
excited
to
peter
impassive
back
then
she
sat
down
rather
limp
and
threw
out
her
hands
helplessly
what
am
i
to
do
she
demanded
every
one
comes
with
cruel
things
to
say
but
no
one
tells
me
what
to
peter
turned
away
from
the
window
you
can
leave
here
ventured
mclean
that
the
first
thing
after
that
yes
and
after
that
what
mclean
glanced
at
peter
then
he
took
a
step
toward
the
girl
you
could
marry
me
harmony
he
said
unsteadily
i
had
expected
to
tell
you
so
soon
or
before
a
third
he
faltered
before
harmony
eyes
full
of
bewilderment
i
be
very
happy
if
you
if
you
could
see
it
that
way
i
care
a
great
deal
you
it
seemed
hours
to
peter
before
she
made
any
reply
and
that
her
voice
came
from
miles
away
is
it
really
as
bad
as
that
she
asked
have
i
made
such
a
mess
of
things
that
some
one
either
you
or
peter
must
marry
me
to
straighten
things
out
i
do
want
to
marry
any
one
do
i
have
to
certainly
you
do
have
to
said
peter
there
was
relief
in
his
voice
relief
and
also
something
of
exultation
mclean
you
mean
well
but
marriage
is
the
solution
we
were
getting
along
all
right
until
our
friends
stepped
in
let
boyer
howl
all
over
the
colony
there
will
be
one
sensible
woman
somewhere
to
come
and
be
comfortable
here
with
us
in
the
interval
we
manage
unless
harmony
is
afraid
in
that
case
afraid
of
what
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
mclean
helpless
peter
triumphant
i
do
not
care
what
boyer
says
at
least
not
much
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
else
at
mclean
picked
up
his
overcoat
at
least
he
appealed
to
peter
you
come
over
to
my
place
no
said
peter
mclean
made
a
final
appeal
to
harmony
if
this
gets
out
he
said
you
are
going
to
regret
it
all
your
i
shall
have
nothing
to
regret
she
retorted
proudly
had
peter
not
been
there
mclean
would
have
made
a
better
case
would
have
pleaded
with
her
would
have
made
less
of
a
situation
that
roused
her
resentment
and
more
of
his
love
for
her
he
was
very
hard
hit
very
young
he
was
almost
hysterical
with
rage
and
helplessness
he
wanted
to
slap
her
to
take
her
in
his
arms
he
writhed
under
the
restraint
of
peter
steady
eyes
he
got
to
the
door
and
turned
furious
then
it
up
to
you
he
flung
at
peter
you
old
enough
to
know
better
she
is
and
do
look
so
damned
superior
you
human
like
the
rest
of
us
and
if
any
harm
comes
to
her
here
unexpectedly
peter
held
out
his
hand
and
after
a
sheepish
moment
mclean
took
it
old
man
said
peter
and
do
be
an
as
was
peter
way
the
words
meant
little
the
tone
much
mclean
knew
what
in
his
heart
he
had
known
all
along
that
the
girl
was
safe
enough
that
all
that
was
to
fear
was
the
gossip
of
he
took
peter
hand
and
then
going
to
harmony
stood
before
her
very
erect
i
suppose
i
said
too
much
i
always
do
he
said
contritely
but
you
know
the
reason
do
forget
the
reason
will
you
i
am
only
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
lingeringly
it
was
a
tragic
moment
for
him
poor
lad
he
turned
and
went
blindly
out
the
door
and
down
the
dark
stone
staircase
it
was
rather
anticlimax
after
all
that
to
have
peter
discover
he
had
gone
without
his
hat
and
toss
it
down
to
him
a
flight
below
all
the
frankness
had
gone
out
of
the
relationship
between
harmony
and
peter
they
made
painful
efforts
at
ease
talked
during
the
meal
of
careful
abstractions
such
as
jimmy
and
peter
proposed
trip
to
semmering
avoided
each
other
eyes
ate
little
or
nothing
once
when
harmony
passed
peter
his
their
fingers
touched
and
between
them
they
dropped
the
cup
harmony
was
flushed
and
pallid
by
turns
peter
wretched
and
silent
out
of
the
darkness
came
one
ray
of
light
stewart
had
wired
from
semmering
urging
peter
to
come
he
would
be
away
for
two
days
in
two
days
much
might
happen
jennings
might
come
or
some
one
else
in
two
days
some
of
the
restraint
would
have
worn
off
things
would
never
be
the
same
but
they
would
be
hours
better
peter
spent
the
early
part
of
the
evening
with
jimmy
reading
aloud
to
him
after
the
child
had
dropped
to
sleep
he
packed
a
valise
for
the
next
day
journey
and
counted
out
into
an
envelope
half
of
the
money
he
had
with
him
this
he
labeled
household
expenses
and
set
it
up
on
his
table
leaning
against
his
there
was
no
sign
of
harmony
about
the
salon
was
dark
except
for
the
study
lamp
turned
down
peter
was
restless
he
put
on
his
shabby
and
worn
slippers
and
wandered
about
the
portier
had
brought
coal
to
the
landing
peter
carried
it
in
he
inspected
the
medicine
bottles
on
jimmy
stand
and
wrote
full
directions
for
every
emergency
he
could
imagine
then
finding
it
still
only
nine
he
turned
up
the
lamp
in
the
salon
and
wrote
an
exciting
letter
from
jimmy
father
in
which
a
lost
lamb
wandering
on
the
had
been
picked
up
by
an
avalanche
and
carried
down
into
the
fold
and
the
arms
of
the
shepherd
and
because
he
stood
so
in
loco
parentis
and
because
it
seemed
so
inevitable
that
before
long
jimmy
would
be
in
the
arms
of
the
shepherd
and
of
course
because
it
had
been
a
trying
day
all
through
peter
lips
were
none
too
steady
as
he
folded
up
the
letter
the
fire
was
dead
in
the
stove
peter
put
out
the
salon
lamp
and
closed
the
shutters
in
the
warm
darkness
he
put
out
his
hand
to
feel
his
way
through
the
room
it
touched
a
little
sweater
coat
of
harmony
hanging
over
the
back
of
a
chair
peter
picked
it
up
in
a
very
passion
of
tenderness
and
held
it
to
him
little
girl
he
choked
my
little
girl
god
help
me
he
was
rather
ashamed
considerably
startled
it
alarmed
him
to
find
that
the
mere
unexpected
touch
of
a
familiar
garment
could
rouse
such
a
storm
in
him
it
made
him
pause
he
put
down
the
coat
and
pulled
himself
up
sharply
mclean
was
right
he
was
only
human
stuff
very
poor
human
stuff
he
put
the
little
coat
down
hastily
only
to
lift
it
again
gently
to
his
lips
dear
he
whispered
goodnight
frau
schwarz
had
had
two
visitors
between
the
hours
of
coffee
and
supper
that
day
the
reason
of
their
call
proved
to
be
neither
rooms
nor
pension
they
came
to
make
inquiries
the
frau
schwarz
made
this
out
at
last
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
the
room
that
had
once
been
peter
and
that
still
lacked
an
occupant
boyer
had
no
german
jennings
very
little
and
that
chiefly
medical
there
is
however
a
sort
of
code
that
answers
instead
of
language
frequently
when
two
or
three
women
of
later
middle
life
are
gathered
together
a
code
born
of
mutual
understanding
mutual
disillusion
mutual
distrust
a
language
of
outspread
hands
raised
eyebrows
portentous
shakings
of
the
head
frau
schwarz
on
the
edge
of
peter
bed
needed
no
english
to
convey
the
fact
that
peter
was
a
bad
lot
not
that
she
resorted
only
to
the
sign
language
the
women
were
also
wicked
she
said
of
a
man
what
does
one
expect
but
of
a
woman
and
the
younger
one
looked
herr
gott
she
had
the
eyes
of
a
saint
the
little
georgiev
was
mad
for
her
when
the
three
of
them
left
disgraced
as
one
may
say
he
came
to
me
he
threatened
me
the
herr
schwarz
god
rest
his
soul
was
a
violent
man
but
never
spoke
he
so
to
me
she
says
interpreted
jennings
that
they
were
a
bad
lot
that
the
younger
one
made
eyes
at
the
herr
schwarz
boyer
drew
her
ancient
sables
about
her
and
put
a
tremulous
hand
on
the
other
woman
arm
what
an
escape
for
you
she
said
if
you
had
gone
there
to
live
and
then
found
the
establishment
queer
from
the
kitchen
of
the
pension
olga
was
listening
an
ear
to
the
door
behind
her
also
listening
but
less
advantageously
was
katrina
american
ladies
said
olga
two
old
and
more
hot
water
growled
katrina
why
do
not
the
americans
stay
in
their
own
country
where
the
water
i
have
learned
comes
hot
from
the
olga
bending
forward
opened
the
door
a
crack
wider
sh
they
do
not
come
for
rooms
they
inquire
for
the
herr
doktor
byrne
and
the
others
no
of
a
then
let
me
to
the
door
a
moment
she
tells
them
everything
and
more
she
says
how
she
is
wicked
katrina
she
says
the
fraulein
harmony
was
not
good
that
she
sent
them
all
away
here
take
the
door
thus
it
happened
that
jennings
and
boyer
having
shaken
off
the
dust
of
a
pension
that
had
once
harbored
three
malefactors
and
having
retired
peter
and
anna
and
harmony
into
the
limbo
of
things
best
forgotten
or
ignored
found
themselves
at
the
corner
confronted
by
a
slovenly
girl
in
heelless
slippers
and
wearing
a
knitted
shawl
over
her
head
the
frau
schwarz
is
wrong
cried
olga
passionately
in
vienna
dialect
they
were
good
all
of
them
what
in
the
world
and
please
tell
me
where
lives
the
fraulein
harmony
the
herr
georgiev
eats
not
nor
sleeps
that
he
can
not
find
jennings
was
puzzled
she
wishes
to
know
where
the
girl
lives
she
interpreted
to
boyer
a
man
wishes
to
naturally
said
boyer
well
do
tell
olga
gathered
from
the
tone
rather
than
the
words
that
she
was
not
to
be
told
she
burst
into
a
despairing
appeal
in
which
the
herr
georgiev
peter
a
necktie
peter
had
forgotten
open
windows
and
hot
water
were
inextricably
confused
jennings
listened
then
waved
her
back
with
a
gesture
she
says
she
interpreted
as
they
walked
on
that
peter
by
which
i
suppose
she
means
byrne
has
left
a
necktie
and
that
she
be
in
hot
water
if
she
does
not
return
boyer
sniffed
in
love
with
him
probably
like
the
others
she
said
chapter
xix
peter
went
to
semmering
the
next
morning
tiptoeing
out
very
early
and
without
breakfast
he
went
in
to
cover
jimmy
lying
diagonally
across
his
small
bed
amid
a
riot
of
tossed
blankets
the
communicating
door
into
harmony
room
was
open
peter
kept
his
eyes
carefully
from
it
but
his
ears
were
less
under
control
he
could
hear
her
soft
breathing
there
were
days
coming
when
peter
would
stand
where
he
stood
then
and
listen
and
find
only
silence
he
tore
himself
away
at
last
closing
the
outer
door
carefully
behind
him
and
lighting
a
match
to
find
his
way
down
the
staircase
the
portier
was
not
awake
peter
had
to
rouse
him
and
to
stand
by
while
he
donned
the
trousers
which
he
deemed
necessary
to
the
dignity
of
his
position
before
he
opened
the
street
door
reluctant
as
he
had
been
to
go
the
change
was
good
for
peter
the
dawn
grew
rosy
promised
sunshine
fulfilled
its
promise
the
hurrying
crowds
at
the
depot
interested
him
he
enjoyed
his
coffee
taken
from
a
bare
table
in
the
station
the
horizontal
morning
sunlight
shining
in
through
marvelously
clean
windows
warmed
the
marble
of
the
floor
made
black
shadows
beside
the
heaps
of
hand
luggage
everywhere
turned
into
gold
the
hair
of
a
toddling
baby
venturing
on
a
tour
of
discovery
the
same
morning
light
alas
revealed
to
peter
a
break
across
the
toe
of
one
of
his
shoes
peter
sighed
then
smiled
the
baby
was
catching
at
the
bits
of
dust
that
floated
in
the
sunshine
suddenly
a
great
wave
of
happiness
overwhelmed
peter
it
was
a
passing
thing
born
of
nothing
but
for
the
instant
that
it
lasted
peter
was
a
king
everything
was
well
the
world
was
his
oyster
life
was
his
to
make
it
what
he
would
youth
and
hope
and
joy
under
the
beatific
influence
he
expanded
grew
almost
shone
youth
and
hope
and
joy
that
cometh
in
the
morning
the
ecstasy
passed
away
but
without
reaction
peter
no
longer
shone
he
still
glowed
he
picked
up
the
baby
and
hugged
it
he
hunted
out
a
beggar
he
had
passed
and
gave
him
five
hellers
he
helped
a
suspicious
old
lady
with
an
bundle
he
called
the
guard
on
the
train
son
and
forced
a
grin
out
of
that
dignitary
peter
traveled
which
was
quite
comfortable
and
no
bother
about
nicht
rauchen
signs
his
unreasonable
cheerfulness
persisted
as
far
as
gloggnitz
there
with
the
increasing
ruggedness
of
the
scenery
and
his
first
view
of
the
raxalpe
came
recollection
of
the
urgency
of
stewart
last
message
of
marie
jedlicka
of
the
sordid
little
tragedy
that
awaited
him
at
the
end
of
his
journey
peter
sobered
life
was
rather
a
mess
after
all
he
reflected
love
was
a
blessing
but
it
was
also
a
curse
after
that
he
sat
back
in
his
corner
and
let
the
mountain
scenery
take
care
of
itself
while
he
recalled
the
look
he
had
surprised
once
or
twice
in
marie
eyes
when
she
looked
at
stewart
it
was
sad
pitiful
marie
was
a
clever
little
thing
if
only
she
had
a
chance
why
was
he
rich
enough
to
help
the
ones
who
needed
help
marie
could
start
again
in
america
with
no
one
the
wiser
and
make
her
way
smart
as
the
devil
these
austrian
girls
peter
reflected
poor
little
guttersnipe
the
weather
was
beautiful
the
sleet
of
the
previous
day
in
vienna
had
been
a
deep
snowfall
on
the
mountains
the
schwarza
was
frozen
the
castle
of
liechtenstein
was
gray
against
a
white
world
a
little
pilgrimage
church
far
below
seemed
snowed
in
against
the
faithful
the
compartment
filled
with
noisy
skiing
parties
the
old
woman
opened
her
oilcloth
bundle
and
taking
a
cat
out
of
a
box
inside
fed
it
a
sausage
up
and
up
past
the
weinzettelwand
and
the
station
breitenstein
across
the
highest
viaduct
the
kalte
rinne
and
so
at
last
to
semmering
the
glow
had
died
at
last
for
peter
he
did
not
like
his
errand
was
very
vague
indeed
as
to
just
what
that
errand
might
be
he
was
stiff
and
rather
cold
also
he
thought
the
cat
might
stifle
in
the
oilcloth
but
the
old
woman
too
clearly
distrusted
him
to
make
it
possible
to
interfere
anyhow
he
did
not
know
the
german
for
either
cat
or
oilcloth
he
had
wired
stewart
but
the
latter
was
not
at
the
station
this
made
him
vaguely
uneasy
he
hardly
knew
why
he
did
not
know
stewart
well
enough
to
know
whether
he
was
punctilious
in
such
matters
or
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
hardly
knew
him
at
all
it
was
because
he
had
appealed
to
him
that
peter
was
there
it
being
only
necessary
to
peter
to
be
needed
and
he
was
anywhere
the
pension
waldheim
was
well
up
the
mountains
he
shouldered
his
valise
and
started
up
first
long
flights
of
steps
through
the
pines
then
a
steep
road
peter
climbed
easily
here
and
there
he
met
groups
coming
down
men
that
he
thought
probably
american
pretty
women
in
tams
and
sweaters
he
watched
for
marie
but
there
was
no
sign
of
her
he
was
half
an
hour
perhaps
in
reaching
the
waldheim
as
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
he
noticed
a
sledge
with
a
dozen
people
following
it
coming
toward
him
it
was
a
singularly
silent
party
peter
with
his
hand
on
the
watched
its
approach
with
some
curiosity
it
stopped
and
the
men
who
had
been
following
closed
up
round
it
even
then
peter
did
not
understand
he
did
not
understand
until
he
saw
stewart
limp
and
unconscious
lifted
out
of
the
straw
and
carried
toward
him
suicide
may
be
moral
cowardice
but
it
requires
physical
bravery
and
marie
was
not
brave
the
balcony
had
attracted
her
it
opened
possibilities
of
escape
of
unceasing
regret
and
repentance
for
stewart
of
publicity
that
would
mean
an
end
to
the
situation
but
every
inch
of
her
soul
was
craven
at
the
thought
she
crept
out
often
and
looked
down
and
as
often
drew
back
shuddering
to
fall
down
down
on
to
the
tree
tops
to
be
dropped
from
branch
to
branch
a
broken
thing
and
perhaps
even
not
yet
dead
that
was
the
unthinkable
thing
to
live
for
a
time
and
suffer
stewart
was
not
ignorant
of
all
that
went
on
in
her
mind
she
had
threatened
him
with
the
balcony
just
as
earlier
in
the
winter
it
had
been
a
with
which
she
had
frightened
him
but
there
was
this
difference
whereas
before
he
had
drawn
her
back
from
the
window
and
clapped
her
into
sanity
now
he
let
her
alone
at
the
end
of
one
of
their
quarrels
she
had
flung
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
then
had
watched
him
through
the
opening
in
the
shutter
he
had
lighted
a
cigarette
stewart
spent
every
daylight
hour
at
the
hotel
or
walking
over
the
mountain
roads
seldom
alone
with
anita
but
always
near
her
he
left
marie
sulking
or
sewing
as
the
case
might
be
he
returned
in
the
evening
to
find
her
still
sulking
still
sewing
but
marie
did
not
sulk
all
day
or
sew
she
too
was
out
never
far
from
stewart
always
watching
many
times
she
escaped
discovery
only
by
a
miracle
as
when
she
stooped
behind
an
oxcart
pretending
to
tie
her
shoe
or
once
when
they
all
met
face
to
face
and
although
she
lowered
her
veil
stewart
must
have
known
her
instantly
had
he
not
been
so
intent
on
helping
anita
over
a
slippery
gutter
she
planned
a
dozen
forms
of
revenge
and
found
them
impossible
of
execution
stewart
himself
was
frightfully
unhappy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
really
in
love
with
all
the
humility
of
the
condition
there
were
days
when
he
would
not
touch
anita
hand
when
he
hardly
spoke
when
the
girl
herself
would
have
been
outraged
at
his
conduct
had
she
not
now
and
then
caught
him
watching
her
seen
the
wretchedness
in
his
eyes
the
form
of
marie
revenge
was
unpremeditated
after
all
the
light
mountain
snow
was
augmented
by
a
storm
roads
were
ploughed
through
early
in
the
morning
leaving
great
banks
on
either
side
were
everywhere
coasting
parties
made
the
steep
roads
a
menace
to
the
pedestrian
every
sleigh
carried
behind
it
a
string
of
sleds
going
back
to
the
below
the
hotel
was
the
serpentine
coast
a
long
and
dangerous
course
full
of
curves
of
sudden
descents
of
long
straightaway
dashes
through
the
woodland
two
miles
perhaps
three
it
wound
its
tortuous
way
down
the
mountain
up
by
the
highroad
to
the
crest
again
only
a
mile
or
less
thus
it
happened
that
the
track
was
always
clear
except
for
speeding
sleds
no
coasters
dragging
sleds
back
up
the
slide
interfered
the
track
was
crowded
every
minute
a
sled
set
out
sped
down
the
straightaway
dipped
turned
disappeared
a
dozen
would
be
lined
up
waiting
for
the
interval
and
the
signal
and
here
watching
from
the
porch
of
the
church
in
the
very
shadow
of
the
saints
marie
found
her
revenge
stewart
had
given
her
a
little
wrist
watch
stewart
and
anita
were
twelfth
in
line
by
the
watch
then
twelve
minutes
down
the
straight
down
through
the
trees
to
a
curve
that
marie
knew
well
a
bad
curve
only
to
be
taken
by
running
well
up
on
the
snowbank
beyond
the
snowbank
there
was
a
drop
fifteen
feet
perhaps
more
into
the
yard
of
a
russian
villa
stewart
and
anita
were
twelfth
a
man
in
a
green
was
eleventh
the
hillside
was
steep
marie
negotiated
it
by
running
from
tree
to
tree
catching
herself
steadying
for
a
second
then
down
again
once
she
fell
and
rolled
a
little
distance
there
was
no
time
to
think
perhaps
had
she
thought
she
would
have
weakened
she
had
no
real
courage
only
desperation
as
she
reached
the
track
the
man
in
the
green
was
in
sight
a
minute
and
a
half
she
had
then
not
more
she
looked
about
her
hastily
a
stone
might
serve
her
purpose
almost
anything
that
would
throw
the
sled
out
of
its
course
she
saw
a
tree
branch
just
above
the
track
and
dragged
at
it
frantically
some
one
was
shouting
at
her
from
an
upper
window
of
the
russian
villa
she
did
not
hear
stewart
and
anita
had
made
the
curve
above
and
were
coming
down
at
frantic
speed
marie
stood
her
back
to
the
oncoming
rush
of
the
sled
swaying
slightly
when
she
could
hear
the
singing
of
the
runners
she
stooped
and
slid
the
tree
branch
out
against
the
track
she
had
acted
almost
by
instinct
but
with
devilish
skill
the
sled
swung
to
one
side
up
the
snowbank
and
launched
itself
into
the
air
marie
heard
the
thud
and
the
silence
that
followed
it
then
she
turned
and
scuttled
like
a
hunted
thing
up
the
mountain
side
peter
put
in
a
bad
day
marie
was
not
about
could
not
be
located
stewart
suffering
from
concussion
lay
insensible
all
day
and
all
of
the
night
peter
could
find
no
fracture
but
felt
it
wise
to
get
another
opinion
in
the
afternoon
he
sent
for
a
doctor
from
the
kurhaus
and
learned
for
the
first
time
that
anita
had
also
been
hurt
a
broken
arm
not
serious
said
the
kurhaus
man
she
is
brave
very
brave
the
young
woman
i
believe
they
are
engaged
peter
said
he
did
not
know
and
thought
very
hard
where
was
marie
not
gone
surely
here
about
him
lay
all
her
belongings
even
her
purse
toward
evening
stewart
showed
some
improvement
he
was
not
conscious
but
he
swallowed
better
and
began
to
toss
about
peter
who
had
had
a
long
day
and
very
little
sleep
the
night
before
began
to
look
jaded
he
would
have
sent
for
a
nurse
from
the
kurhaus
but
he
doubted
ability
to
stand
any
extra
financial
strain
and
peter
could
not
help
any
the
time
for
supper
passed
and
no
marie
the
landlady
sent
up
a
tray
to
peter
stewed
meat
and
potatoes
a
salad
coffee
peter
sat
in
a
corner
with
his
back
to
stewart
and
ate
ravenously
he
had
had
nothing
since
the
morning
coffee
after
that
he
sat
down
again
by
the
bed
to
watch
there
was
little
to
do
but
watch
the
meal
had
made
him
drowsy
he
thought
of
his
pipe
perhaps
if
he
got
some
fresh
air
and
a
smoke
he
remembered
the
balcony
it
was
there
on
the
balcony
that
he
found
marie
a
cowering
thing
that
pushed
his
hands
away
when
he
would
have
caught
her
and
broke
into
passionate
crying
i
can
not
i
can
not
can
not
what
demanded
peter
gently
watching
her
so
near
was
the
balcony
rail
throw
myself
over
i
tried
peter
i
can
not
i
should
think
not
said
peter
sternly
just
now
when
we
need
you
too
come
in
and
do
be
a
foolish
but
marie
would
not
go
in
she
held
back
clinging
tight
to
peter
big
hand
moaning
out
in
the
dialect
of
the
people
that
always
confused
him
her
story
of
the
day
of
what
she
had
done
of
watching
stewart
brought
back
of
stealing
into
the
house
and
through
an
adjacent
room
to
the
balcony
of
her
desperation
and
her
cowardice
she
was
numb
with
cold
exhaustion
and
hunger
quite
childish
helpless
peter
stood
out
on
the
balcony
with
his
arm
round
her
while
the
night
wind
beat
about
them
and
pondered
what
was
best
to
do
he
thought
she
might
come
in
and
care
for
stewart
at
least
until
he
was
conscious
he
could
get
her
some
supper
how
can
i
she
asked
i
was
seen
they
are
searching
for
me
now
oh
peter
peter
who
is
searching
for
you
who
saw
you
the
people
in
the
russian
did
they
see
your
face
i
wore
a
veil
i
think
then
come
in
and
change
your
clothes
there
is
a
train
down
at
midnight
you
can
take
i
have
no
this
raised
a
delicate
question
marie
absolutely
refused
to
take
stewart
money
she
had
almost
none
of
her
own
and
there
were
other
complications
where
was
she
to
go
the
family
of
the
injured
girl
did
not
suspect
her
since
they
did
not
know
of
her
existence
she
might
get
away
without
trouble
but
after
that
what
peter
pondered
this
on
the
balcony
while
marie
in
the
bedroom
was
changing
her
clothing
soaked
with
a
day
in
the
snow
he
came
to
the
inevitable
decision
the
decision
he
knew
at
the
beginning
that
he
was
going
to
make
if
i
could
only
put
it
up
to
harmony
first
he
reflected
but
she
will
understand
when
i
tell
her
she
always
standing
there
on
the
little
balcony
with
tragedy
the
thickness
of
a
pine
board
beyond
him
peter
experienced
a
bit
of
the
glow
of
the
morning
as
of
one
who
stumbling
along
in
a
dark
place
puts
a
hand
on
a
friend
he
went
into
the
room
stewart
was
lying
very
still
and
breathing
easily
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
knelt
marie
at
peter
step
she
rose
and
faced
him
i
am
leaving
him
peter
for
good
said
peter
heartily
better
for
you
and
better
for
marie
drew
a
long
breath
the
night
train
she
said
listlessly
is
an
express
i
had
forgotten
it
is
double
what
of
that
little
sister
said
peter
what
is
a
double
fare
when
it
means
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
there
will
be
happiness
little
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
chapter
xx
the
portier
was
almost
happy
that
morning
for
one
thing
he
had
won
honorable
mention
at
the
schubert
society
the
night
before
for
another
that
night
the
engel
was
to
sing
mignon
and
the
portier
had
spent
his
christmas
tips
for
a
ticket
all
day
long
he
had
been
poring
over
the
score
du
das
land
wo
die
citronen
bluhen
he
sang
with
feeling
while
he
polished
the
floors
he
polished
them
with
his
feet
wearing
felt
boots
for
the
purpose
and
executing
in
the
doing
a
sort
of
ungainly
dance
a
sprinkle
of
wax
right
foot
forward
and
back
left
foot
forward
and
back
both
feet
forward
and
back
in
a
sort
of
double
shuffle
more
wax
more
vigorous
polishing
more
singing
with
longer
pauses
for
breath
thou
the
land
where
the
lemon
trees
bloom
he
bellowed
sprinkle
of
wax
right
foot
left
foot
any
foot
at
all
now
and
then
he
took
the
score
from
his
pocket
and
pored
over
it
humming
the
air
raising
his
eyebrows
over
the
high
notes
dropping
his
chin
to
the
low
ones
it
was
a
wonderful
morning
between
greetings
to
neighbors
he
sang
a
bit
of
talk
a
bit
of
song
du
das
land
sir
the
old
rax
wears
a
crown
it
will
snow
soon
du
das
land
wo
die
citronen
ah
madam
the
milk
frau
and
are
the
cows
frozen
up
like
the
pump
no
marvelous
dost
thou
know
that
is
mignon
at
the
opera
and
that
the
engel
sings
du
das
land
at
eleven
came
rosa
with
her
husband
the
soldier
from
salzburg
with
one
lung
he
was
having
a
holiday
from
his
sentry
duty
at
the
hospital
and
the
one
lung
seemed
to
be
a
libel
for
while
the
women
had
coffee
together
and
a
bit
of
mackerel
he
sang
a
very
fair
bass
to
the
tenor
together
they
pored
over
the
score
and
even
on
their
way
to
the
beer
hall
hummed
together
such
bits
as
they
recalled
on
one
point
they
differed
the
score
was
old
and
soiled
with
much
thumbing
at
one
point
destroyed
long
since
the
sentry
sang
a
sharp
the
portier
insisted
on
a
natural
they
argued
together
over
three
steins
of
beer
the
waiter
referred
to
decided
for
a
flat
it
was
a
serious
matter
to
have
one
teeth
set
as
one
may
say
for
a
natural
and
then
to
be
shocked
with
an
unexpected
up
or
down
it
destroyed
the
illusion
it
disappointed
it
hurt
the
sentry
stuck
to
the
sharp
it
was
sung
so
at
the
salzburg
opera
the
portier
snapped
his
thumb
at
the
salzburg
opera
things
were
looking
serious
they
walked
back
to
the
locale
in
silence
the
sentry
coughed
possibly
there
was
something
after
all
in
the
rumor
it
was
then
that
the
portier
remembered
harmony
she
would
know
perhaps
she
had
the
score
harmony
was
having
a
bad
morning
she
had
slept
little
until
dawn
and
peter
stealthy
closing
of
the
outer
door
had
wakened
her
by
its
very
caution
after
that
there
had
been
no
more
sleep
she
had
sat
up
in
bed
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
thought
in
the
pitiless
dawn
with
no
peter
to
restore
her
to
cheerfulness
things
looked
black
indeed
to
what
had
she
fallen
that
first
one
man
and
then
another
must
propose
marriage
to
her
to
save
her
to
save
her
from
what
from
what
people
thought
or
each
from
the
other
were
men
so
evil
that
they
never
trusted
each
other
mclean
had
frankly
distrusted
peter
had
said
so
or
could
it
be
that
there
was
something
about
her
something
light
and
frivolous
she
had
been
frivolous
she
always
laughed
at
peter
foolishnesses
perhaps
that
was
it
that
was
it
they
were
afraid
for
her
she
had
thrown
herself
on
hands
almost
into
his
arms
she
had
made
this
situation
she
must
get
away
of
course
if
only
she
had
some
one
to
care
for
jimmy
until
peter
returned
but
there
was
no
one
the
portier
wife
was
fond
of
jimmy
but
not
skillful
and
suppose
he
were
to
wake
in
the
night
and
call
for
her
and
she
would
not
come
she
cried
a
little
over
this
after
a
time
she
pattered
across
the
room
in
her
bare
feet
and
got
from
a
bureau
drawer
the
money
she
had
left
there
was
not
half
enough
to
take
her
home
she
could
write
the
little
mother
might
get
some
for
her
but
at
infinite
cost
infinite
humiliation
that
would
have
to
be
a
final
desperate
resort
she
felt
a
little
more
cheerful
when
she
had
had
a
cup
of
coffee
jimmy
wakened
about
that
time
and
she
went
through
the
details
of
his
morning
toilet
with
all
the
brightness
she
could
assume
bath
blankets
warm
bath
toenails
fresh
nightgown
fresh
sheets
and
final
touch
of
all
a
real
barber
part
straight
from
crown
to
brow
after
that
ten
minutes
under
extra
comforters
while
the
room
aired
she
hung
over
the
boy
that
morning
in
an
agony
of
tenderness
he
was
so
little
so
frail
and
she
must
leave
him
only
one
thing
sustained
her
the
boy
loved
her
but
it
was
peter
he
idolized
when
he
had
peter
he
needed
nothing
else
in
some
curious
process
of
his
childish
mind
peter
and
daddy
mingled
in
inextricable
confusion
more
than
once
he
had
recalled
events
in
the
roving
life
he
and
his
father
had
led
you
remember
that
do
you
he
would
say
certainly
i
remember
peter
would
reply
heartily
that
evening
on
the
steamer
when
i
ate
so
many
of
course
and
were
not
ill
not
that
time
but
you
said
i
make
a
good
pudding
you
remember
that
do
you
and
peter
would
recall
it
all
peter
would
be
left
that
was
the
girl
comfort
she
made
a
beginning
at
gathering
her
things
together
that
morning
while
the
boy
dozed
and
the
white
mice
scurried
about
the
little
cage
she
could
not
take
her
trunk
or
peter
would
trace
it
she
would
have
to
carry
her
belongings
a
few
at
a
time
to
wherever
she
found
a
room
then
when
peter
came
back
she
could
slip
away
and
he
would
never
find
her
at
noon
came
the
portier
and
the
sentry
now
no
longer
friends
and
rang
the
doorbell
harmony
was
rather
startled
mclean
and
boyer
had
been
her
only
callers
and
she
did
not
wish
to
see
either
of
them
but
after
a
second
ring
she
gathered
her
courage
in
her
hands
and
opened
the
door
she
turned
pale
when
she
saw
the
sentry
in
his
belted
tunic
and
high
cap
she
thought
of
course
that
jimmy
had
been
traced
and
that
now
he
would
be
taken
away
if
the
sentry
knew
her
however
he
kept
his
face
impassive
and
merely
touched
his
cap
the
portier
stated
their
errand
harmony
face
cleared
she
even
smiled
as
the
portier
extended
to
her
the
thumbed
score
with
its
missing
corner
what
after
all
does
it
matter
which
was
right
whether
it
was
a
sharp
or
a
natural
what
really
matters
is
that
harmony
having
settled
the
dispute
and
clinched
the
decision
by
running
over
the
score
for
a
page
or
two
turned
to
find
the
portier
ecstatic
eyes
upturned
hands
folded
on
paunch
enjoying
a
delirium
of
pleasure
and
the
sentry
nowhere
in
sight
he
was
discovered
a
moment
later
in
the
doorway
of
jimmy
room
where
taciturn
as
ever
severe
martial
he
stood
at
attention
shoulders
back
arms
at
his
sides
thumbs
in
in
this
position
he
was
making
with
amazing
rapidity
a
series
of
hideous
grimaces
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
boy
in
the
bed
marvelous
faces
they
were
in
which
nose
mouth
and
eyes
seemed
interchangeable
where
features
played
leapfrog
with
one
another
when
all
was
over
perhaps
when
his
repertoire
was
exhausted
the
sentry
returned
his
nose
to
the
center
of
his
face
replaced
eyes
and
mouth
and
wiped
the
ensemble
with
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
then
still
in
silence
he
saluted
and
withdrew
leaving
the
youngster
enraptured
staring
at
the
doorway
harmony
had
decided
the
approximate
location
of
her
room
in
the
higher
part
of
the
city
in
the
sixteenth
district
there
were
many
unpretentious
buildings
she
had
hunted
board
there
and
she
knew
it
was
far
from
the
stadt
far
from
the
fashionable
part
of
town
a
neighborhood
of
small
shops
of
frank
indigence
there
surely
she
could
find
a
room
and
perhaps
in
one
of
the
small
stores
what
she
failed
to
secure
in
the
larger
a
position
rosa
having
taken
her
soldier
away
harmony
secured
the
portier
wife
to
sit
with
jimmy
and
spent
two
hours
that
afternoon
looking
about
for
a
room
she
succeeded
finally
in
finding
one
a
small
and
wretchedly
furnished
bedroom
part
of
the
suite
of
a
cheap
dressmaker
the
approach
was
forbidding
enough
one
entered
a
cavelike
court
under
the
building
filled
with
wagons
feeding
horses
quarrelsome
and
swearing
teamsters
from
the
side
a
stone
staircase
took
off
and
led
twisting
from
one
landing
cave
to
another
to
the
upper
floor
here
lived
the
dressmaker
amid
the
constant
whirring
of
the
babel
of
workpeople
harmony
seeking
not
a
home
but
a
took
the
room
at
once
she
was
asked
for
no
reference
in
a
sort
of
agony
lest
this
haven
fail
her
she
paid
for
a
week
in
advance
the
wooden
bed
the
cracked
mirror
over
the
table
even
the
pigeons
outside
on
the
windowsill
were
hers
for
a
week
the
dressmaker
was
friendly
almost
garrulous
i
will
have
it
cleaned
she
explained
i
have
been
so
busy
the
masquerade
season
is
on
the
fraulein
is
american
is
she
not
one
knows
the
americans
they
are
chic
not
like
the
english
i
have
some
american
harmony
started
the
dressmaker
was
shrewd
many
people
hid
in
the
sixteenth
district
she
hastened
to
reassure
the
girl
they
will
not
disturb
you
and
just
now
i
have
but
one
a
dancer
i
shall
have
the
room
cleaned
so
far
good
she
had
a
refuge
now
one
spot
that
the
venom
of
scandal
could
not
poison
where
she
could
study
and
work
work
hard
although
there
could
be
no
more
lessons
one
spot
where
peter
would
not
have
to
protect
her
where
peter
indeed
would
never
find
her
this
thought
which
should
have
brought
comfort
brought
only
new
misery
peace
seemed
dearly
bought
all
at
once
shabby
wholesome
hearty
peter
with
his
rough
hair
and
quiet
voice
his
bulging
pockets
and
steady
eyes
she
was
leaving
peter
forever
exchanging
his
companionship
for
that
of
a
row
of
pigeons
on
a
he
would
find
some
one
of
course
but
who
would
know
that
he
liked
toast
made
hard
and
plenty
of
butter
or
to
leave
his
loose
at
the
foot
peter
being
very
long
and
apt
to
lop
over
the
lopping
over
brought
a
tear
or
two
a
very
teary
and
tragic
young
heroine
this
harmony
prone
to
go
about
for
the
last
day
or
two
with
a
damp
little
handkerchief
tucked
in
her
sleeve
she
felt
her
way
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
cave
below
fate
hangs
by
a
very
slender
thread
sometimes
if
a
wagon
had
not
lumbered
by
as
she
reached
the
lowest
step
so
that
she
must
wait
and
thus
had
time
to
lower
her
veil
she
would
have
been
recognized
at
once
by
the
little
georgiev
waiting
to
ascend
but
the
wagon
was
there
harmony
lowered
her
veil
the
little
georgiev
passing
a
veiled
young
woman
in
the
gloom
went
up
the
staircase
with
even
pulses
and
calm
and
judicial
bearing
up
to
the
tiny
room
a
floor
or
two
below
harmony
where
he
wrote
reports
to
the
minister
of
war
and
mixed
them
with
sonnets
to
harmony
harmony
went
back
to
the
siebensternstrasse
having
accomplished
what
she
had
set
out
to
do
and
being
very
wretched
in
consequence
because
she
was
leaving
the
boy
so
soon
she
strove
to
atone
for
her
coming
defection
by
making
it
a
gala
evening
the
child
was
very
happy
she
tucked
him
up
in
the
salon
lighted
all
the
candles
served
him
the
daintiest
of
suppers
there
she
brought
in
the
mice
and
tied
tiny
bows
on
their
necks
she
played
checkers
with
him
while
the
supper
dishes
waited
and
went
down
to
defeat
in
three
hilarious
games
and
last
of
all
she
played
to
him
joyous
music
at
first
then
slower
drowsier
airs
until
his
heavy
head
dropped
on
his
shoulder
and
she
gathered
him
up
in
tender
arms
and
carried
him
to
bed
it
was
dawn
when
marie
arrived
harmony
was
sleeping
soundly
when
the
bell
rang
her
first
thought
was
that
peter
had
come
back
but
peter
carried
a
key
the
bell
rang
again
and
she
slipped
on
the
old
kimono
and
went
to
the
door
is
it
peter
she
called
hand
on
knob
i
come
from
peter
i
have
a
letter
in
german
who
is
it
you
do
not
know
me
marie
jedlicka
please
let
me
come
bewildered
harmony
opened
the
door
and
like
a
gray
ghost
marie
slipped
by
her
and
into
the
hall
there
was
a
gaslight
burning
very
low
harmony
turned
it
up
and
faced
her
visitor
she
recognized
her
at
once
the
girl
stewart
had
been
with
in
the
something
has
happened
to
peter
no
he
is
well
he
sent
this
to
the
fraulein
i
am
the
fraulein
marie
held
out
the
letter
and
staggered
harmony
put
her
in
a
chair
she
was
bewildered
almost
frightened
crisis
of
some
sort
was
written
on
marie
face
harmony
felt
very
young
very
incapable
the
other
girl
refused
coffee
would
not
even
go
into
the
salon
until
peter
letter
had
been
read
she
was
a
fugitive
a
criminal
the
austrian
law
is
severe
to
those
that
harbor
criminals
let
harmony
read
dear
harry
will
you
forgive
me
for
this
and
spread
the
wings
of
your
splendid
charity
over
this
poor
child
perhaps
i
am
doing
wrong
in
sending
her
to
you
but
just
now
it
is
all
i
can
think
of
if
she
wants
to
talk
let
her
talk
it
will
probably
help
her
also
feed
her
will
you
and
if
she
can
not
sleep
give
her
one
of
the
blue
powders
i
fixed
for
jimmy
i
be
back
later
if
i
can
make
it
peter
harmony
glanced
up
from
the
letter
marie
sat
drooping
in
her
chair
her
eyes
were
sunken
in
her
head
she
had
recognized
her
at
once
but
any
surprise
she
may
have
felt
at
finding
harmony
in
peter
apartment
was
sunk
in
a
general
apathy
a
compound
of
nervous
reaction
and
fatigue
during
the
long
hours
in
the
express
she
had
worn
herself
out
with
fright
and
remorse
there
was
nothing
left
now
but
exhaustion
harmony
was
bewildered
but
obedient
she
went
back
to
the
cold
kitchen
and
lighted
a
fire
she
made
marie
as
comfortable
as
she
could
in
the
salon
and
then
went
into
her
room
to
dress
there
she
read
the
letter
again
and
wondered
if
peter
had
gone
through
life
like
this
picking
up
waifs
and
strays
and
shouldering
their
burdens
for
them
decidedly
life
with
peter
was
full
of
surprises
she
remembered
as
she
hurried
into
her
clothes
the
boys
club
back
in
america
and
the
decidedly
also
peter
was
an
occupation
a
state
of
mind
a
career
no
musician
hoping
for
a
career
of
her
own
could
possibly
marry
peter
that
was
a
curious
morning
in
the
old
lodge
of
maria
theresa
while
stewart
in
the
pension
waldheim
struggled
back
to
consciousness
while
peter
sat
beside
him
and
figured
on
an
old
envelope
the
problem
of
dividing
among
four
enough
money
to
support
one
while
mclean
ate
his
heart
out
in
wretchedness
in
his
hotel
marie
told
her
story
over
the
early
breakfast
sitting
with
her
thin
elbows
on
the
table
her
pointed
chin
in
her
palms
and
now
i
am
sorry
she
finished
it
has
done
no
good
if
it
had
only
killed
her
but
she
was
not
much
hurt
i
saw
her
rise
and
bend
over
harmony
was
silent
she
had
no
stock
of
aphorisms
for
the
situation
no
worldly
knowledge
only
pity
did
peter
say
he
would
recover
yes
they
will
both
recover
and
go
to
america
and
he
will
marry
perhaps
harmony
would
have
been
less
comfortable
marie
less
frank
had
marie
realized
that
this
establishment
of
peter
was
not
on
the
same
basis
as
stewart
had
been
or
had
harmony
divined
her
thought
the
presence
of
the
boy
was
discovered
by
his
waking
marie
was
taken
in
and
presented
she
looked
stupefied
certainly
the
americans
were
a
marvelous
people
to
have
taken
into
their
house
and
their
hearts
this
strange
child
if
he
were
strange
marie
suspicious
little
slum
mind
was
not
certain
in
the
safety
and
comfort
of
the
little
apartment
the
viennese
expanded
cheered
she
devoted
herself
to
the
boy
telling
him
strange
folk
tales
singing
snatches
of
songs
for
him
the
youngster
took
a
liking
to
her
at
once
it
seemed
to
harmony
going
about
her
morning
routine
that
marie
was
her
solution
and
peter
during
the
afternoon
she
took
a
package
to
the
branch
and
mailed
it
by
to
the
wollbadgasse
on
the
way
she
met
boyer
face
to
face
that
lady
looked
severely
ahead
and
harmony
passed
her
with
her
chin
well
up
and
the
eyes
of
a
wounded
animal
mclean
sent
a
great
box
of
flowers
that
day
she
put
them
for
lack
of
a
vase
in
a
pitcher
beside
jimmy
bed
at
dusk
a
telegram
came
to
say
that
stewart
was
better
and
that
peter
was
on
his
way
down
to
vienna
he
would
arrive
at
eight
time
was
very
short
now
seconds
flashed
by
minutes
galloped
harmony
stewed
a
chicken
for
supper
and
creamed
the
breast
for
jimmy
she
fixed
the
table
flowers
in
the
center
the
best
cloth
peter
favorite
cheese
six
seven
marie
was
telling
jimmy
a
fairy
tale
and
making
the
fairies
out
of
rosebuds
the
studylamp
was
lighted
the
stove
glowing
peter
slippers
were
out
his
old
his
pipe
a
quarter
past
seven
peter
would
be
near
vienna
now
and
hungry
if
he
could
only
eat
his
supper
before
he
learned
but
that
was
impossible
he
would
come
in
as
he
always
did
and
slam
the
outer
door
and
open
it
again
to
close
it
gently
as
he
always
did
and
then
he
would
look
for
her
going
from
room
to
room
until
he
found
her
only
he
would
not
find
her
she
did
not
say
to
jimmy
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
said
a
little
prayer
for
him
marie
had
made
the
flower
fairies
on
needles
and
they
stood
about
his
head
on
the
pillow
pink
and
yellow
and
white
elves
with
fluffy
skirts
then
very
silently
she
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
closed
the
outer
door
behind
her
in
the
courtyard
she
turned
and
looked
up
the
great
chandelier
in
the
salon
was
not
lighted
but
from
the
casement
windows
shone
out
the
comfortable
glow
of
peter
lamp
chapter
xxi
peter
had
had
many
things
to
think
over
during
the
ride
down
the
mountains
he
had
the
compartment
to
himself
and
sat
in
a
corner
soft
hat
over
his
eyes
life
had
never
been
particularly
simple
to
peter
his
own
life
yes
a
matter
of
three
meals
a
day
he
had
had
fewer
a
roof
clothing
but
other
lives
had
always
touched
him
closely
and
at
the
contact
points
peter
glowed
fused
amalgamated
thus
he
had
been
many
people
good
indifferent
bad
but
all
needy
thus
also
peter
had
committed
vicarious
crimes
suffered
vicarious
illnesses
starved
died
loved
vicariously
and
now
after
years
of
living
for
others
peter
was
living
at
last
for
himself
and
suffering
not
that
he
understood
exactly
what
ailed
him
he
thought
he
was
tired
which
was
true
enough
having
had
little
sleep
for
two
or
three
nights
also
he
explained
to
himself
that
he
was
smoking
too
much
and
resolutely
lighted
another
cigarette
two
things
had
revealed
peter
condition
to
himself
mclean
had
said
you
are
crazy
in
love
with
mclean
statement
lacking
subtlety
had
had
a
certain
quality
of
directness
even
then
peter
utterly
miserable
had
refused
to
capitulate
when
to
capitulate
would
have
meant
the
surrender
of
the
house
in
the
siebensternstrasse
and
the
absence
from
harmony
had
shown
him
just
where
he
stood
he
was
in
love
crazy
in
love
every
fiber
of
his
long
body
glowed
with
it
ached
with
it
and
every
atom
of
his
reason
told
him
what
mad
folly
it
was
this
love
even
if
harmony
cared
and
at
the
mere
thought
his
heart
pounded
what
madness
for
her
what
idiocy
for
him
to
ask
her
to
accept
the
half
of
nothing
to
give
up
a
career
to
share
his
struggle
for
one
to
ask
her
to
bury
her
splendid
talent
and
her
beauty
under
a
bushel
that
he
might
wave
aloft
his
feeble
light
and
there
was
no
way
out
no
royal
road
to
fortune
by
the
route
he
had
chosen
nothing
but
grinding
work
with
a
result
problematical
and
years
ahead
there
were
even
no
legacies
to
expect
he
thought
whimsically
peter
had
known
a
chap
once
struggling
along
in
gynecology
who
had
had
a
fortune
left
him
by
a
which
being
interpreted
is
grateful
patient
peter
patients
had
a
way
of
living
and
when
they
did
drop
out
as
happened
now
and
then
had
also
a
way
of
leaving
peter
an
unpaid
bill
in
token
of
appreciation
peter
had
even
occasionally
helped
to
bury
them
by
way
he
defended
himself
of
covering
up
his
mistakes
peter
sitting
back
in
his
corner
allowed
the
wonderful
scenery
to
slip
by
unnoticed
he
put
harmony
the
desirable
out
of
his
mind
and
took
to
calculating
on
a
scrap
of
paper
what
could
be
done
for
harmony
the
musician
he
could
hold
out
for
three
months
he
calculated
and
still
have
enough
to
send
harmony
home
and
to
get
home
himself
on
a
slow
boat
the
canadian
lines
were
cheap
if
jimmy
lived
perhaps
he
could
take
him
along
if
not
he
would
have
to
put
six
months
work
in
the
next
three
that
was
not
so
hard
he
had
got
along
before
with
less
sleep
and
thrived
on
it
also
there
must
be
no
more
idle
evenings
with
jimmy
in
the
salon
propped
in
a
chair
and
harmony
playing
the
room
dark
save
for
the
glow
from
the
stove
and
for
the
one
candle
at
harmony
elbow
all
roads
lead
to
rome
peter
thoughts
having
traveled
in
a
circle
were
back
again
to
harmony
the
desirable
harmony
playing
in
the
firelight
harmony
hushed
over
the
brick
stove
harmony
paring
potatoes
that
night
in
the
kitchen
when
he
harmony
harmony
stewart
knew
all
about
the
accident
and
its
cause
peter
had
surmised
as
much
when
the
injured
man
failed
to
ask
for
marie
he
tested
him
finally
by
bringing
marie
name
into
the
conversation
stewart
ignored
it
accepted
her
absence
refused
to
be
drawn
that
was
at
first
during
the
day
however
as
he
gained
strength
he
grew
restless
and
uneasy
as
the
time
approached
for
peter
to
leave
he
was
clearly
struggling
with
himself
the
landlady
had
agreed
to
care
for
him
and
was
bustling
about
the
room
during
one
of
her
absences
he
turned
to
peter
i
suppose
marie
has
been
round
she
came
back
last
did
she
tell
you
yes
poor
she
a
devil
stewart
said
and
lay
silent
then
i
saw
her
shoot
that
thing
out
in
front
of
us
but
there
was
no
time
where
is
she
now
marie
i
sent
her
to
stewart
fell
back
relieved
not
even
curious
thank
heaven
for
that
he
said
i
do
want
to
see
her
again
i
do
something
i
be
sorry
for
the
kindest
thing
to
say
for
her
is
that
she
was
not
no
said
peter
gravely
she
was
hardly
stewart
caught
his
steady
gaze
and
glanced
away
for
him
marie
little
tragedy
had
been
written
and
erased
he
would
forget
it
magnanimously
he
had
divided
what
he
had
with
her
and
she
had
repaid
him
by
attempting
his
life
and
not
only
his
life
but
anita
peter
followed
his
line
of
reasoning
easily
it
quite
a
frequent
complication
stewart
he
said
but
every
man
to
whom
it
happens
regards
himself
more
or
less
as
a
victim
she
fell
in
love
with
you
that
all
her
conduct
is
contrary
to
the
ethics
of
the
game
but
she
been
playing
poor
cards
all
where
is
she
that
does
matter
does
it
stewart
had
lain
back
and
closed
his
eyes
no
it
did
matter
a
sense
of
great
relief
overwhelmed
him
marie
was
gone
frightened
into
hiding
it
was
as
if
a
band
that
had
been
about
him
was
suddenly
loosed
he
breathed
deep
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
laughed
from
sheer
reaction
then
catching
peter
not
particularly
approving
eyes
he
colored
good
lord
peter
he
said
you
do
know
what
i
gone
through
with
that
little
devil
and
now
she
gone
he
glanced
round
the
disordered
room
where
bandages
and
medicines
crowded
toilet
articles
on
the
where
one
of
marie
small
slippers
still
lay
where
it
had
fallen
under
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
her
rosary
still
hung
over
the
corner
of
the
table
ring
for
the
maid
peter
will
you
i
got
to
get
this
junk
out
of
here
some
of
anita
people
may
during
that
afternoon
ride
while
the
train
down
the
mountains
peter
thought
of
all
this
some
of
marie
junk
was
in
his
bag
her
rosary
lay
in
his
breastpocket
along
with
the
pin
he
had
sent
her
at
christmas
peter
happened
on
it
still
in
its
box
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cried
over
he
had
brought
it
with
him
he
admired
it
very
much
and
it
had
cost
money
he
could
ill
afford
to
spend
it
was
late
when
the
train
drew
into
the
station
peter
encumbered
with
marie
luggage
and
his
own
lowered
his
window
and
added
his
voice
to
the
chorus
of
plaintive
calls
portier
portier
they
shouted
portier
bawled
peter
he
was
obliged
to
resort
to
the
extravagance
of
a
taxicab
possibly
a
fiacre
would
have
done
as
well
but
it
cost
almost
as
much
and
was
slower
moments
counted
now
a
second
was
an
hour
an
hour
a
decade
for
he
was
on
his
way
to
harmony
extravagance
became
recklessness
as
soon
die
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
he
stopped
the
taxicab
and
bought
a
bunch
of
violets
stopped
again
and
bought
lilies
of
the
valley
to
combine
with
the
violets
went
out
of
his
way
to
the
american
grocery
and
bought
a
jar
of
preserved
fruit
by
that
time
he
was
laden
the
jar
of
preserves
hung
in
one
shabby
pocket
marie
rosary
dangled
from
another
the
violets
were
buttoned
under
his
overcoat
against
the
cold
at
the
very
last
he
held
the
taxi
an
extra
moment
and
darted
into
the
delicatessen
shop
across
the
siebensternstrasse
from
there
standing
inside
the
doorway
he
could
see
the
lights
in
the
salon
across
the
way
the
glow
of
his
lamp
the
flicker
that
was
the
fire
peter
whistled
stamped
his
cold
feet
quite
neglected
in
spite
of
repeated
warnings
from
harmony
to
watch
the
herr
schenkenkaufer
weigh
the
cheese
accepted
without
a
glance
a
piece
with
a
hole
in
it
and
how
is
the
child
asked
the
herr
schenkenkaufer
covering
the
defective
gold
piece
with
conversation
i
do
not
know
i
have
been
away
said
peter
he
almost
sang
it
all
is
well
or
i
would
have
heard
wilhelm
the
portier
was
but
just
now
all
well
of
course
sang
peter
eyes
on
the
comfortable
floor
of
his
lamp
the
flicker
that
was
the
fire
auf
wiedersehen
herr
auf
wiedersehen
herr
violets
cheese
rosary
luggage
thus
peter
climbed
the
stairs
the
portier
wished
to
assist
him
but
peter
declined
the
portier
was
noisy
there
was
to
be
a
moment
when
peter
having
admitted
himself
with
extreme
caution
would
present
himself
without
so
much
as
a
creak
to
betray
him
would
stand
in
a
doorway
until
some
one
harmony
perhaps
ah
peter
would
turn
and
see
him
she
had
a
way
of
putting
one
slender
hand
over
her
heart
when
she
was
startled
peter
put
down
the
jar
of
preserved
peaches
outside
it
was
to
be
a
second
surprise
also
he
put
down
the
flowers
they
were
to
be
brought
in
last
of
all
one
surprise
after
another
is
a
cumulative
happiness
peter
did
not
wish
to
swallow
all
his
cake
in
one
bite
for
once
he
did
not
slam
the
outer
door
although
he
very
nearly
did
and
only
caught
it
at
the
cost
of
a
bruised
finger
inside
he
listened
there
was
no
clatter
of
dishes
no
scurrying
back
and
forth
from
table
to
stove
in
the
final
excitement
of
dishing
up
there
was
however
a
highly
agreeable
odor
of
stewing
chicken
a
crisp
smell
of
baking
biscuit
in
the
darkened
hall
peter
had
to
pause
to
steady
himself
for
he
had
a
sudden
mad
impulse
to
shout
harmony
name
to
hold
out
his
arms
to
call
her
to
him
there
in
the
warm
darkness
and
when
she
had
come
to
catch
her
to
him
to
tell
his
love
in
one
long
embrace
his
arms
about
her
his
rough
cheek
against
her
soft
one
no
wonder
he
grew
somewhat
dizzy
and
had
to
pull
himself
together
the
silence
rather
surprised
him
until
he
recalled
that
harmony
was
probably
sewing
in
the
salon
as
she
did
sometimes
when
dinner
was
ready
to
serve
the
boy
was
asleep
no
doubt
he
stole
along
on
tiptoe
hardly
breathing
to
the
first
doorway
which
was
jimmy
jimmy
was
asleep
round
him
were
the
pink
and
yellow
and
white
flower
fairies
with
violet
heads
peter
saw
them
and
smiled
then
his
eyes
growing
accustomed
to
the
light
he
saw
marie
face
down
on
the
floor
her
head
on
her
arms
still
as
she
was
peter
knew
she
was
not
sleeping
only
fighting
her
battle
over
again
and
losing
some
of
the
joyousness
of
his
return
fled
from
peter
never
to
come
back
the
two
silent
figures
were
too
close
to
tragedy
peter
with
a
long
breath
stole
past
the
door
and
on
to
the
salon
no
harmony
there
but
the
great
room
was
warm
and
cheery
the
table
was
drawn
near
the
stove
and
laid
for
abendessen
the
white
porcelain
had
boiled
and
extinguished
itself
according
to
its
method
and
now
gently
steamed
on
to
the
kitchen
much
odor
of
food
here
two
candles
lighted
but
burning
low
a
small
platter
with
money
on
it
quite
a
little
money
almost
all
he
had
left
harmony
when
he
went
away
peter
was
dazed
at
first
even
when
marie
hastily
summoned
had
discovered
that
harmony
clothing
was
gone
when
a
search
of
the
rooms
revealed
the
absence
of
her
violin
and
her
music
when
at
last
the
fact
stared
them
incontestable
in
the
face
peter
refused
to
accept
it
he
sat
for
a
or
even
more
by
the
fire
in
the
salon
obstinately
refusing
to
believe
she
was
gone
keeping
the
supper
warm
against
her
return
he
did
not
think
or
reason
he
sat
and
waited
saying
nothing
hardly
moving
save
when
a
gust
of
wind
slammed
the
garden
gate
then
he
was
all
alive
sat
erect
ears
straining
for
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
outer
door
the
numbness
of
the
shock
passed
at
last
to
be
succeeded
by
alarm
during
all
the
time
that
followed
that
condition
persisted
fright
almost
terror
harmony
alone
in
the
city
helpless
dependent
harmony
seeking
employment
under
conditions
peter
knew
too
well
but
with
his
alarm
came
rage
marie
had
never
seen
peter
angry
she
shrank
from
this
gaunt
and
man
who
raved
up
and
down
the
salon
questioning
the
frightened
portier
swearing
fierce
oaths
bringing
accusation
after
accusation
against
some
unnamed
woman
to
whom
he
applied
epithets
that
marie
english
luckily
did
not
comprehend
not
a
particularly
heroic
figure
was
peter
that
night
a
frantic
disheveled
individual
before
whom
the
portier
cowered
who
struggled
back
to
sanity
through
a
berserk
haze
and
was
liable
to
swift
relapses
into
fury
again
to
this
succeeded
at
last
the
mental
condition
that
was
to
be
for
many
days
hopelessness
and
alarm
and
a
grim
determination
to
keep
on
searching
there
were
no
clues
the
portier
made
inquiries
of
all
the
cabstands
in
the
neighborhood
harmony
had
not
taken
a
cab
the
delicatessen
seller
had
seen
her
go
out
that
afternoon
with
a
bundle
and
return
without
it
she
had
been
gone
only
an
hour
or
so
that
gave
peter
a
ray
of
hope
that
she
might
have
found
a
haven
in
the
neighborhood
until
he
recalled
the
one
possibility
he
clung
to
boyer
had
made
the
mischief
but
she
had
also
offered
the
girl
a
home
she
might
be
at
the
boyers
peter
flinging
on
a
hat
and
without
his
overcoat
went
to
the
boyers
time
was
valuable
and
he
had
wasted
an
hour
two
hours
in
useless
rage
so
he
took
a
taxicab
and
being
by
this
time
utterly
reckless
of
cost
let
it
stand
while
he
interviewed
the
boyers
boyer
himself
partially
undressed
opened
the
door
to
his
ring
peter
was
past
explanation
or
ceremonial
is
harmony
here
he
demanded
harmony
harmony
wells
she
disappeared
come
in
said
boyer
alive
to
the
strain
in
peter
voice
i
know
i
have
heard
anything
i
ask
during
the
interval
it
took
for
a
whispered
colloquy
in
the
bedroom
and
for
boyer
to
don
her
flannel
wrapper
peter
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
whatever
boyer
had
meant
to
say
by
way
of
protest
at
the
intrusion
on
the
sacred
privacy
of
eleven
and
bedtime
died
in
her
throat
her
plump
and
terraced
chin
shook
with
agitation
perhaps
with
guilt
peter
however
had
got
himself
in
hand
he
told
a
quiet
story
boyer
listened
boyer
clutching
her
wrapper
about
her
unstayed
figure
listened
i
thought
finished
peter
that
since
you
had
offered
her
a
refuge
from
me
she
might
have
come
i
offered
her
a
refuge
before
i
had
been
to
the
pension
ah
said
peter
slowly
and
what
about
the
pension
schwarz
need
you
ask
i
learned
that
you
were
all
put
out
there
i
am
obliged
to
say
byrne
that
under
the
circumstances
had
the
girl
come
here
i
could
hardly
frank
i
will
speak
i
could
hardly
have
taken
her
peter
went
white
and
ducked
as
from
a
physical
blow
stumbling
out
into
the
hall
again
there
he
thought
of
something
to
say
in
reply
repudiation
thought
better
of
it
started
down
the
stairs
boyer
followed
him
helplessly
at
the
street
door
however
he
put
his
hand
on
peter
shoulder
you
know
old
man
i
do
believe
that
these
women
i
know
said
peter
simply
thank
you
chapter
xxii
harmony
only
thought
had
been
flight
from
peter
from
mclean
from
boyer
she
had
devoted
all
her
energies
to
losing
herself
to
cutting
the
threads
that
bound
her
to
the
life
in
the
siebensternstrasse
she
had
drawn
all
her
money
as
peter
discovered
later
the
discovery
caused
him
even
more
acute
anxiety
the
city
was
full
of
thieves
poverty
and
its
companion
crime
lurked
on
every
shadowy
staircase
of
the
barracklike
houses
or
peered
from
every
alleyway
and
into
this
city
of
contrasts
of
gray
women
of
the
night
hugging
gratings
for
warmth
and
accosting
with
loathsome
gestures
of
smug
civilians
hiding
sensuous
mouths
under
great
mustaches
of
dapper
soldiers
to
whom
the
young
girl
unattended
was
potential
prey
into
this
night
city
of
terror
this
day
city
of
frightful
contrasts
ermine
rubbing
elbows
with
flesh
destitution
sauntering
along
the
fashionable
prater
for
lack
of
shelter
gilt
wheels
of
royalty
and
yellow
wheels
of
courtesans
harmony
had
ventured
alone
for
the
second
time
and
this
time
there
was
no
peter
byrne
to
accost
her
cheerily
in
the
twilight
and
win
her
by
sheer
friendliness
she
was
alone
her
funds
were
lower
much
lower
and
something
else
had
gone
her
faith
boyer
had
seen
to
that
in
the
autumn
harmony
had
faced
the
city
and
unafraid
now
she
feared
it
met
it
with
averted
eyes
alas
understood
it
it
was
not
the
harmony
who
had
bade
a
brave
farewell
to
scatchy
and
the
big
soprano
in
the
station
who
fled
to
her
refuge
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
house
in
the
wollbadgasse
this
was
a
hunted
creature
alternately
flushed
and
pale
who
locked
her
door
behind
her
before
she
took
off
her
hat
and
who
having
taken
off
her
hat
and
surveyed
her
with
tragic
eyes
fell
suddenly
to
trembling
alone
there
in
the
gaslight
she
had
had
no
plans
beyond
flight
she
had
meant
once
alone
to
think
the
thing
out
but
the
room
was
cold
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
and
the
single
slovenly
maid
was
a
hungarian
and
spoke
no
german
the
dressmaker
had
gone
to
the
ronacher
harmony
did
not
know
where
to
find
a
restaurant
was
afraid
to
trust
herself
to
the
streets
alone
she
went
to
bed
supperless
with
a
tiny
picture
of
peter
and
jimmy
and
the
wooden
sentry
under
her
cheek
the
pigeons
cooing
on
the
wakened
her
early
she
was
confused
at
first
got
up
to
see
if
jimmy
had
thrown
off
his
blankets
and
wakened
to
full
consciousness
with
the
sickening
realization
that
jimmy
was
not
there
the
dressmaker
whose
name
was
monia
reiff
slept
late
after
her
evening
out
harmony
collapsing
with
hunger
and
faintness
waited
as
long
as
she
could
then
she
put
on
her
things
desperately
and
ventured
out
surely
at
this
hour
peter
would
not
be
searching
and
even
if
he
were
he
would
never
think
of
the
sixteenth
district
he
would
make
inquiries
of
course
the
pension
schwarz
boyers
the
master
the
breakfast
brought
back
her
strength
and
the
morning
air
gave
her
confidence
the
district
too
was
less
formidable
than
the
neighborhood
of
the
karntnerstrasse
and
the
graben
the
shops
were
smaller
the
windows
exhibited
cheaper
goods
there
was
a
sort
of
family
atmosphere
about
many
of
them
the
head
of
the
establishment
in
the
doorway
the
wife
at
the
cashier
desk
daughters
cousins
nieces
behind
the
wooden
counters
the
shopkeepers
were
approachable
instead
of
familiar
harmony
met
no
rebuffs
was
respectfully
greeted
and
cheerfully
listened
to
in
many
cases
the
application
ended
in
a
general
consultation
shopkeeper
wife
daughters
nieces
slim
clerks
with
tiny
mustaches
she
got
addresses
followed
them
up
more
consultations
more
addresses
but
no
work
the
reason
dawned
on
her
after
a
day
of
tramping
during
which
she
kept
carefully
away
from
that
part
of
the
city
where
peter
might
be
searching
for
her
the
fact
was
of
course
that
her
knowledge
of
english
was
her
sole
asset
as
a
clerk
and
there
were
few
english
and
no
tourists
in
the
sixteenth
district
she
was
marketing
a
commodity
for
which
there
was
no
demand
she
lunched
at
a
konditorei
more
to
rest
her
tired
body
than
because
she
needed
food
the
afternoon
was
as
the
morning
at
six
long
after
the
midwinter
darkness
had
fallen
she
stumbled
back
to
the
wollbadgasse
and
up
the
whitewashed
staircase
she
had
a
shock
at
the
second
landing
a
man
had
stepped
into
the
angle
to
let
her
pass
a
gasjet
dared
over
his
head
and
she
recognized
the
short
heavy
figure
and
ardent
eyes
of
georgiev
she
had
her
veil
down
luckily
and
he
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
she
passed
on
and
she
heard
him
a
second
later
descending
but
there
had
been
something
reminiscent
after
all
in
her
figure
and
carriage
the
little
georgiev
paused
halfway
down
and
thought
a
moment
it
was
impossible
of
course
all
women
reminded
him
of
the
american
had
he
not
only
the
day
before
followed
for
two
city
blocks
a
woman
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
merely
because
she
carried
a
violin
case
but
there
was
something
about
the
girl
he
had
just
passed
bah
a
bad
week
for
harmony
followed
a
week
of
weary
days
and
restless
nights
when
she
slept
only
to
dream
of
peter
of
his
hurt
and
incredulous
eyes
when
he
found
she
had
gone
of
jimmy
that
he
needed
her
was
worse
was
dying
more
than
once
she
heard
him
sobbing
and
wakened
to
the
cooing
of
the
pigeons
on
the
she
grew
thin
and
took
to
dividing
her
small
hoard
half
of
it
with
her
half
under
the
carpet
so
that
in
case
of
accident
all
would
not
be
gone
this
as
it
happened
was
serious
one
day
the
sixth
she
came
back
wet
to
the
skin
from
an
rain
to
find
that
the
carpet
bank
had
been
looted
there
was
no
clue
the
stolid
hungarian
startled
out
of
her
lethargy
protested
innocence
the
little
dressmaker
who
seemed
honest
and
friendly
wept
in
sheer
sympathy
the
fact
remained
half
the
small
hoard
was
gone
two
days
more
a
sunday
and
a
monday
on
sunday
harmony
played
and
georgiev
in
the
room
below
translating
into
cipher
a
recent
conference
between
the
austrian
minister
of
war
and
the
german
ambassador
put
aside
his
work
and
listened
she
played
as
once
before
she
had
played
when
life
seemed
sad
and
tragic
the
georgiev
hands
behind
his
head
and
eyes
upturned
was
back
in
the
pension
schwarz
that
night
months
ago
when
harmony
played
the
humoresque
and
peter
stooped
outside
her
door
the
little
bulgarian
sighed
and
dreamed
harmony
a
little
sadder
a
little
more
forlorn
each
day
pursued
her
hopeless
quest
she
ventured
into
the
heart
of
the
stadt
and
paid
a
part
of
her
remaining
money
to
an
employment
bureau
to
teach
english
or
violin
whichever
offered
or
even
both
after
she
had
paid
they
told
her
it
would
be
difficult
almost
impossible
without
references
she
had
another
narrow
escape
as
she
was
leaving
she
almost
collided
with
olga
the
chambermaid
who
having
clashed
for
the
last
time
with
katrina
was
seeking
new
employment
on
another
occasion
she
saw
marie
in
the
crowd
and
was
obsessed
with
a
longing
to
call
to
her
to
ask
for
peter
for
jimmy
that
meeting
took
the
heart
out
of
the
girl
marie
was
white
and
weary
perhaps
the
boy
was
worse
perhaps
peter
her
heart
contracted
but
that
was
absurd
of
course
peter
was
always
well
and
strong
two
things
occurred
that
week
one
unexpected
the
other
inevitable
the
unexpected
occurrence
was
that
monia
reiff
finding
harmony
being
pressed
for
work
offered
the
girl
a
situation
the
wage
was
small
but
she
could
live
on
it
the
inevitable
was
that
she
met
georgiev
on
the
stairs
without
her
veil
it
was
the
first
day
in
the
workroom
the
apprentices
were
carrying
home
boxes
for
a
ball
that
night
thread
was
needed
and
quickly
harmony
who
did
odds
and
ends
of
sewing
was
most
easily
spared
she
slipped
on
her
jacket
and
hat
and
ran
down
to
the
shop
near
by
it
was
on
the
return
that
she
met
georgiev
coming
down
the
afternoon
was
dark
and
the
staircase
unlighted
in
the
gloom
one
face
was
as
another
georgiev
listening
intently
hearing
footsteps
drew
back
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
waited
his
swarthy
face
was
tense
expectant
as
the
steps
drew
near
were
light
feminine
instead
of
stealthy
the
little
spy
relaxed
somewhat
but
still
he
waited
crouched
it
was
a
second
before
he
recognized
harmony
another
instant
before
he
realized
his
good
fortune
she
had
almost
passed
he
put
out
an
unsteady
hand
fraulein
herr
georgiev
the
little
bulgarian
was
profoundly
stirred
his
fervid
eyes
gleamed
he
struggled
against
the
barrier
of
language
broke
out
in
passionate
bulgar
switched
to
german
punctuated
with
an
english
word
here
and
there
made
intelligible
it
was
that
he
had
found
her
at
last
harmony
held
her
spools
of
thread
and
waited
for
the
storm
of
languages
to
subside
then
but
you
are
not
to
say
you
have
seen
me
herr
no
harmony
colored
i
am
am
hiding
she
explained
something
very
uncomfortable
happened
and
i
came
here
please
do
say
you
have
seen
georgiev
was
puzzled
at
first
she
had
to
explain
very
slowly
with
his
ardent
eyes
on
her
but
he
understood
at
last
and
agreed
of
course
his
incredulity
was
turning
to
certainty
harmony
had
actually
been
in
the
same
building
with
him
while
he
sought
her
everywhere
else
then
he
said
at
last
it
was
you
who
played
i
she
made
a
move
to
pass
him
but
he
held
out
an
imploring
hand
fraulein
i
may
see
you
sometimes
we
shall
meet
again
of
fraulein
with
all
respect
sometime
perhaps
you
will
walk
out
with
me
i
am
very
busy
all
at
night
then
for
the
exercise
i
with
all
respect
fraulein
harmony
was
touched
sometime
she
consented
and
then
impulsively
i
am
very
lonely
herr
she
held
out
her
hand
and
the
little
bulgarian
bent
over
it
and
kissed
it
reverently
the
herr
georgiev
father
was
a
nobleman
in
his
own
country
and
all
the
little
spy
training
had
been
to
make
of
a
girl
in
harmony
situation
lawful
prey
but
in
the
spy
glowing
heart
there
was
nothing
for
harmony
to
fear
she
knew
it
he
stood
hat
in
hand
while
she
went
up
the
staircase
then
fraulein
anxiously
yes
was
there
below
at
the
entrance
a
tall
man
in
a
green
velours
hat
i
saw
no
one
i
thank
you
he
watched
her
slender
figure
ascend
lose
itself
in
the
shadows
listened
until
she
reached
the
upper
floors
then
with
a
sigh
he
clapped
his
hat
on
his
head
and
made
his
cautious
way
down
to
the
street
there
was
no
man
in
a
green
velours
hat
below
but
the
little
spy
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
eyes
watched
him
nevertheless
life
was
growing
complicated
for
the
herr
georgiev
life
was
pressing
very
close
to
harmony
also
in
those
days
a
life
she
had
never
touched
before
she
discovered
after
a
day
or
two
in
the
that
monia
reiff
business
lay
almost
altogether
among
the
the
of
marie
type
many
of
them
found
in
the
customers
endless
topics
of
conversation
some
things
harmony
was
spared
much
of
the
talk
being
in
dialect
but
a
great
deal
of
it
she
understood
and
she
learned
much
that
was
not
spoken
they
talked
freely
of
the
women
their
clothes
and
they
talked
a
great
deal
about
a
newcomer
an
american
dancer
for
whom
monia
was
making
an
elaborate
outfit
the
american
name
was
lillian
le
grande
she
was
dancing
at
one
of
the
variety
theaters
harmony
was
working
on
a
costume
for
the
le
grande
woman
a
gold
brocade
slashed
to
the
knee
at
one
side
and
with
a
fragment
of
bodice
made
of
gilt
tissue
on
the
day
after
her
encounter
with
georgiev
she
met
her
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
gown
something
about
the
draping
monia
flushed
with
irritation
came
to
the
workroom
door
and
glanced
over
the
girls
she
singled
out
harmony
finally
and
called
her
come
and
put
on
the
american
gown
she
ordered
she
wishes
heaven
knows
what
she
wishes
harmony
went
unwillingly
nothing
she
had
heard
of
the
fraulein
le
grande
had
prepossessed
her
her
uneasiness
was
increased
when
she
found
herself
obliged
to
shed
her
gown
and
to
stand
for
one
terrible
moment
before
the
little
dressmaker
amused
eyes
thou
art
very
lovely
very
chic
said
monia
the
dress
added
to
rather
than
relieved
harmony
discomfiture
she
donned
it
in
one
of
the
made
by
the
simple
expedient
of
curtaining
off
a
corner
of
the
large
reception
room
the
slashed
skirt
embarrassed
her
the
low
cut
made
her
shrink
monia
was
frankly
entranced
above
the
gold
tissue
of
the
bodice
rose
harmony
exquisite
shoulders
her
hair
was
gold
even
her
eyes
looked
golden
the
dressmaker
who
worshiped
beauty
gave
a
pull
here
a
pat
there
if
only
all
women
were
so
beautiful
in
the
things
she
made
she
had
an
eye
for
the
theatrical
also
she
posed
harmony
behind
the
curtain
arranged
lights
drew
down
the
chiffon
so
that
a
bit
more
of
the
girl
rounded
bosom
was
revealed
then
she
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
stood
smiling
le
grande
paid
the
picture
the
tribute
of
a
second
silence
then
exquisite
she
said
in
english
then
in
halting
german
do
not
change
a
line
it
is
harmony
must
walk
in
the
gown
turn
sit
once
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
herself
and
was
startled
she
had
been
wearing
black
for
so
long
and
now
this
radiant
golden
creature
was
herself
she
was
enchanted
and
abashed
the
slash
in
the
skirt
troubled
her
her
slender
leg
had
a
way
of
revealing
itself
the
ordeal
was
over
at
last
the
dancer
was
pleased
she
ordered
another
gown
harmony
behind
the
curtain
slipped
out
of
the
dress
and
into
her
own
shabby
frock
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
the
dancer
was
talking
her
voice
was
loud
but
rather
agreeable
she
smoked
a
cigarette
scraps
of
chatter
came
to
harmony
and
once
a
laugh
that
is
too
pink
something
more
here
is
a
shade
hold
it
to
your
i
am
a
bad
color
i
did
not
sleep
last
still
no
news
fraulein
none
he
has
disappeared
utterly
that
is
so
bad
is
it
i
could
use
more
it
is
being
much
worn
it
is
strange
is
it
not
that
a
child
could
be
stolen
from
the
hospital
and
leave
no
sign
the
dancer
laughed
a
mirthless
laugh
her
voice
changed
became
nasal
full
of
venom
oh
they
know
well
enough
she
snapped
those
nurses
know
and
there
a
pig
of
a
doctor
i
like
to
poison
him
separating
mother
and
child
i
going
to
find
him
if
only
to
show
them
they
are
not
so
smart
after
in
her
anger
she
had
lapsed
into
english
harmony
behind
her
curtain
had
clutched
at
her
heart
jimmy
mother
chapter
xxiii
jimmy
was
not
so
well
although
harmony
flight
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
relapse
he
had
found
marie
a
slavishly
devoted
substitute
and
besides
peter
had
indicated
that
harmony
absence
was
purely
temporary
but
the
was
inevitable
all
day
long
the
child
lay
in
the
white
bed
apathetic
but
sleepless
in
vain
marie
made
flower
fairies
for
his
pillow
in
vain
the
little
mice
now
quite
tame
played
over
the
bed
in
vain
peter
paused
long
enough
in
his
frantic
search
for
harmony
to
buy
colored
postcards
and
bring
them
to
him
he
was
contented
enough
he
did
not
suffer
at
all
and
he
had
no
apprehension
of
what
was
coming
he
asked
for
nothing
tried
obediently
to
eat
liked
to
have
marie
in
the
room
but
he
did
not
beg
to
be
taken
into
the
salon
as
he
once
had
done
there
was
a
sort
of
mental
confusion
also
he
liked
marie
to
read
his
father
letters
but
as
he
grew
weaker
the
occasional
confusing
of
peter
with
his
dead
father
became
a
fixed
idea
peter
was
daddy
peter
took
care
of
him
at
night
he
had
moved
into
harmony
adjacent
room
and
dressed
there
but
he
had
never
slept
in
the
bed
at
night
he
put
on
his
shabby
and
worn
slippers
and
lay
on
a
haircloth
sofa
at
the
foot
of
jimmy
bed
lay
but
hardly
slept
so
afraid
was
he
that
the
slender
thread
of
life
might
snap
when
it
was
drawn
out
to
its
slenderest
during
the
darkest
hours
before
the
dawn
more
than
once
in
every
night
peter
rose
and
stood
hardly
breathing
with
the
tiny
lamp
in
his
hand
watching
for
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
boy
thin
little
chest
peter
grew
old
these
days
he
turned
gray
over
the
ears
and
developed
lines
about
his
mouth
that
never
left
him
again
he
felt
gray
and
old
and
sometimes
bitter
and
hard
also
the
boy
condition
could
not
be
helped
it
was
inevitable
hopeless
but
the
thing
that
was
eating
his
heart
out
had
been
unnecessary
and
cruel
where
was
harmony
when
it
stormed
as
it
did
almost
steadily
he
wondered
how
she
was
sheltered
when
the
occasional
sun
shone
he
hoped
it
was
bringing
her
a
bit
of
cheer
now
and
then
in
the
night
when
the
lamp
burned
low
and
gusts
of
wind
shook
the
old
house
fearful
thoughts
came
to
him
the
canal
with
its
filthy
depths
daylight
brought
reason
however
harmony
had
been
too
rational
too
sane
for
such
an
end
mclean
was
peter
great
support
in
those
terrible
days
he
was
young
and
hopeful
also
he
had
money
peter
could
not
afford
to
grease
the
machinery
of
the
police
service
mclean
could
and
did
in
berlin
harmony
could
not
have
remained
hidden
for
two
days
in
vienna
however
it
was
different
returns
were
made
to
the
department
but
irregularly
an
american
music
student
was
missing
there
were
thousands
of
american
music
students
in
the
city
one
fell
over
them
in
the
mclean
offered
a
reward
and
followed
up
innumerable
music
students
the
alternating
hope
and
despair
was
most
trying
peter
became
old
and
haggard
the
boy
grew
thin
and
white
but
there
was
this
difference
that
with
peter
the
strain
was
cumulative
hour
on
hour
day
on
day
with
mclean
each
night
found
him
worn
and
exhausted
but
each
following
morning
he
went
to
work
with
renewed
strength
and
energy
perhaps
after
all
the
iron
had
not
struck
so
deep
into
his
soul
with
peter
it
was
a
matter
clinics
and
lectures
had
begun
again
but
he
had
no
heart
for
work
the
little
household
went
on
methodically
marie
remained
there
had
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
she
cooked
peter
food
what
little
he
would
eat
she
nursed
jimmy
while
peter
was
out
on
the
long
search
and
she
kept
the
apartment
neat
she
was
never
intrusive
never
talkative
indeed
she
seemed
to
have
lapsed
into
definite
silence
she
deferred
absolutely
to
peter
adored
him
indeed
from
afar
she
never
ate
with
him
in
spite
of
his
protests
the
little
apartment
was
very
quiet
where
formerly
had
been
music
and
harmony
soft
laughter
where
anna
gates
had
been
wont
to
argue
with
peter
in
loud
incisive
tones
where
even
the
prisms
of
the
chandelier
had
once
vibrated
in
response
to
harmony
violin
almost
absolute
silence
now
reigned
even
the
gate
having
been
repaired
no
longer
creaked
and
the
loud
altercations
between
the
portier
and
his
wife
had
been
silenced
out
of
deference
to
the
sick
child
on
the
day
that
harmony
in
the
gold
dress
had
discovered
mother
in
the
american
dancer
peter
had
had
an
unusually
bad
day
mclean
had
sent
him
a
note
by
messenger
early
in
the
morning
to
the
effect
that
a
young
girl
answering
harmony
description
had
been
seen
in
the
park
at
schonbrunn
and
traced
to
an
apartment
near
by
harmony
had
liked
schonbrunn
and
it
seemed
possible
they
had
gone
out
together
mclean
optimistic
peter
afraid
to
hope
and
it
had
been
as
he
feared
a
pretty
little
violin
student
indeed
who
had
been
washing
her
hair
and
only
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
two
mclean
made
a
lame
apology
peter
too
sick
with
disappointment
to
speak
then
back
to
the
city
again
he
had
taken
to
making
a
daily
round
to
the
master
to
the
frau
professor
bergmeister
along
the
graben
and
the
karntnerstrasse
ending
up
at
the
doctors
club
in
the
faint
hope
of
a
letter
wrath
still
smouldered
deep
in
peter
he
would
not
enter
a
room
at
the
club
if
boyer
sat
within
he
had
had
a
long
hour
with
jennings
and
left
that
cheerful
person
writhing
in
abasement
and
he
had
held
a
stormy
interview
with
the
frau
schwarz
which
left
her
humble
for
a
week
and
exceedingly
nervous
being
of
the
impression
from
manner
that
in
the
event
of
harmony
not
turning
up
an
american
gunboat
would
sail
up
the
right
arm
of
the
danube
and
bombard
the
pension
schwarz
schonbrunn
having
failed
them
mclean
and
peter
went
back
to
the
city
in
the
neither
one
saying
much
even
mclean
elasticity
was
deserting
him
his
eyes
from
much
peering
into
crowds
had
taken
on
a
strained
concentrated
look
peter
was
shabbier
than
ever
beside
the
other
man
ultrafashionable
dress
he
sat
bent
forward
his
long
arms
dangling
between
his
knees
his
head
down
their
common
trouble
had
drawn
the
two
together
or
had
drawn
mclean
close
to
peter
as
if
he
recognized
that
there
were
degrees
in
grief
and
that
peter
had
received
almost
a
his
old
rage
at
peter
had
died
harmony
flight
had
proved
the
situation
as
no
amount
of
protestation
would
have
done
the
thing
now
was
to
find
the
girl
then
he
and
peter
would
start
even
and
the
battle
to
the
best
man
they
had
the
car
almost
to
themselves
peter
had
not
spoken
since
he
sat
down
mclean
was
busy
over
a
notebook
in
which
he
jotted
down
from
day
to
day
such
details
of
their
search
as
might
be
worth
keeping
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
peter
as
if
he
wished
to
say
something
hesitated
fell
to
work
again
over
the
notebook
finally
he
ventured
how
the
boy
not
so
well
i
having
a
couple
of
men
in
to
see
him
he
does
do
you
sleep
not
much
he
on
my
mind
of
that
and
other
things
peter
do
you
think
would
it
be
better
to
have
a
nurse
you
ca
go
like
this
all
day
and
be
up
all
night
you
know
and
marie
has
him
most
of
the
mclean
of
course
had
known
marie
before
the
boy
ought
to
have
a
nurse
i
he
does
move
without
my
hearing
that
an
argument
for
me
do
you
want
to
get
sick
peter
turned
a
white
face
toward
mclean
a
face
in
which
exasperation
struggled
with
fatigue
good
lord
boy
he
rasped
do
you
suppose
i
have
a
nurse
if
i
could
afford
it
would
you
let
me
help
i
like
to
do
something
i
a
useless
cub
in
a
but
i
could
do
that
who
the
woman
he
liked
in
the
hospital
nurse
elisabet
i
do
know
mac
there
no
reason
why
i
let
you
help
i
suppose
it
hurts
of
course
but
if
he
would
be
happier
that
settled
then
said
mclean
nurse
elisabet
if
she
can
come
and
look
here
old
man
i
been
trying
to
say
this
for
a
week
and
have
had
the
nerve
let
me
help
you
out
for
a
while
you
can
send
it
back
when
you
get
it
any
time
a
year
or
ten
years
i
not
miss
but
peter
refused
he
tempered
the
refusal
in
his
kindly
way
i
ca
take
anything
now
he
said
but
i
remember
it
and
if
things
get
very
bad
i
come
to
you
it
is
costing
much
to
live
marie
is
a
good
manager
almost
as
good
as
harmony
this
with
difficulty
he
found
it
always
hard
to
speak
of
harmony
his
throat
seemed
to
close
on
the
name
that
was
the
best
mclean
could
do
but
he
made
a
mental
reservation
to
see
marie
that
night
and
slip
her
a
little
money
peter
need
never
know
would
never
notice
at
a
the
car
stopped
and
the
little
bulgarian
georgiev
got
on
he
inspected
the
car
carefully
before
he
came
in
from
the
platform
and
sat
down
unobtrusively
in
a
corner
things
were
not
going
well
with
him
either
his
small
black
eyes
darted
from
face
to
face
suspiciously
until
they
came
to
a
rest
on
peter
it
was
georgiev
business
to
read
men
quickly
he
put
together
the
bits
he
had
gathered
from
harmony
on
the
staircase
added
to
them
despondent
attitude
his
strained
face
the
abstraction
which
required
a
touch
on
the
arm
from
his
companion
when
they
reached
their
destination
recalled
peter
outside
the
door
of
harmony
room
in
the
pension
schwarz
and
built
him
a
little
story
that
was
not
far
from
the
truth
peter
left
the
car
without
seeing
him
it
was
the
hour
of
the
promenade
when
the
ring
and
the
larger
business
streets
were
full
of
people
when
demel
was
thronged
with
pretty
women
eating
american
ices
with
military
men
drinking
tea
and
nibbling
austrian
pastry
the
hour
when
the
flower
women
along
the
stephansplatz
did
a
rousing
business
in
roses
when
sterile
women
burned
candles
before
the
madonna
in
the
cathedral
when
the
lottery
did
the
record
business
of
the
day
it
was
peter
forlorn
hope
that
somewhere
among
the
crowd
he
might
happen
on
harmony
for
some
reason
he
thought
of
her
always
as
in
a
crowd
with
people
close
touching
her
men
staring
at
her
following
her
he
had
spent
a
frightful
night
in
the
opera
scanning
seat
after
seat
not
so
much
because
he
hoped
to
find
her
as
because
inaction
was
intolerable
and
so
on
that
afternoon
he
made
his
slow
progress
along
the
karntnerstrasse
halting
now
and
then
to
scrutinize
the
crowd
he
even
peered
through
the
doors
of
shops
here
and
there
hoping
while
he
feared
that
the
girl
might
be
seeking
employment
within
as
she
had
before
in
the
early
days
of
the
winter
because
of
his
stature
and
powerful
physique
and
perhaps
too
because
of
the
wretchedness
in
his
eyes
people
noticed
him
there
was
one
place
where
peter
lingered
where
a
new
building
was
being
erected
and
where
because
of
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
the
dense
crowd
was
thinned
as
it
passed
he
stood
by
choice
outside
a
hairdresser
window
where
a
brilliant
light
shone
on
each
face
that
passed
inside
the
clerks
had
noticed
him
two
of
them
standing
together
by
the
desk
spoke
of
him
he
is
there
again
the
gray
man
ah
so
but
yes
there
is
his
back
poor
one
it
is
the
fraulein
engel
he
waits
to
see
more
likely
le
grande
the
american
he
is
he
is
russian
look
at
his
but
his
shoes
triumphantly
they
are
american
little
the
third
girl
had
not
spoken
she
was
wrapping
in
tissue
a
great
golden
rose
made
for
the
hair
she
placed
it
in
a
box
carefully
i
think
he
is
of
the
police
she
said
or
a
spy
there
is
much
talk
of
foolishness
does
a
police
officer
sigh
always
or
a
spy
have
such
sadness
in
his
face
and
he
grows
thin
and
the
rose
the
clerk
who
had
wrapped
up
the
flower
held
it
out
to
the
customer
the
customer
however
was
not
looking
she
was
gazing
with
strange
intentness
at
the
back
of
a
worn
gray
overcoat
then
with
a
curious
clutch
at
her
heart
she
went
white
harmony
of
course
harmony
come
to
fetch
the
golden
rose
that
was
to
complete
le
grande
costume
she
recovered
almost
at
once
and
made
an
excuse
to
leave
by
another
exit
she
took
a
final
look
at
the
gray
sleeve
that
was
all
she
could
see
of
peter
who
had
shifted
a
bit
and
stumbled
out
into
the
crowd
walking
along
with
her
lip
trembling
under
her
veil
and
with
the
slow
and
steady
ache
at
her
heart
that
she
had
thought
she
had
stilled
for
good
it
had
never
occurred
to
harmony
that
peter
loved
her
he
had
proposed
to
her
twice
but
that
had
been
in
each
case
to
solve
a
difficulty
for
her
and
once
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
but
that
was
different
even
then
he
had
not
said
he
loved
her
had
not
even
known
it
to
be
exact
nor
had
harmony
realized
what
peter
meant
to
her
until
she
had
put
him
out
of
her
life
the
sight
of
the
familiar
gray
coat
the
scrap
of
conversation
so
enlightening
as
to
poor
peter
quest
that
peter
was
growing
thin
and
white
made
her
almost
reel
she
had
been
too
occupied
with
her
own
position
to
realize
peter
with
the
glimpse
of
him
came
a
great
longing
for
the
house
on
the
siebensternstrasse
for
jimmy
arms
about
her
neck
for
the
salon
with
the
lamp
lighted
and
the
sleet
beating
harmlessly
against
the
casement
windows
for
the
little
kitchen
with
the
brick
stove
for
peter
doubts
of
the
wisdom
of
her
course
assailed
her
but
to
go
back
meant
at
the
best
adding
to
peter
burden
of
jimmy
and
marie
meant
the
old
situation
again
too
for
marie
most
certainly
did
not
add
to
the
respectability
of
the
establishment
and
other
doubts
assailed
her
what
if
jimmy
were
not
so
well
should
die
as
was
possible
and
she
had
not
let
his
mother
see
him
monia
reiff
was
very
busy
that
day
harmony
did
not
leave
the
workroom
until
eight
during
all
that
time
while
her
slim
fingers
worked
over
fragile
laces
and
soft
chiffons
she
was
seeing
jimmy
as
she
had
seen
him
last
with
the
flower
fairies
on
his
pillow
and
peter
keeping
watch
over
the
crowd
in
the
karntnerstrasse
looking
with
his
steady
eyes
for
her
no
part
of
the
city
was
safe
for
a
young
girl
after
night
she
knew
the
sixteenth
district
was
no
better
than
the
rest
rather
worse
in
places
but
the
longing
to
see
the
house
on
the
siebensternstrasse
grew
on
her
became
from
an
ache
a
sharp
and
insistent
pain
she
must
go
must
see
once
again
the
comfortable
glow
of
peter
lamp
the
flicker
that
was
the
fire
she
ate
no
supper
she
was
too
tired
to
eat
and
there
was
the
pain
she
put
on
her
wraps
and
crept
down
the
whitewashed
staircase
the
paved
courtyard
below
was
to
be
crossed
and
it
was
poorly
lighted
she
achieved
the
street
however
without
molestation
to
the
was
only
a
block
but
during
that
block
she
was
accosted
twice
she
was
white
and
frightened
when
she
reached
the
car
the
siebensternstrasse
at
last
the
street
was
always
dark
the
delicatessen
shop
was
closed
but
in
the
store
next
a
light
was
burning
low
and
a
flame
flickered
before
the
little
shrine
over
the
money
drawer
the
gameseller
was
a
religious
man
the
old
stucco
house
dominated
the
neighborhood
from
the
time
she
left
the
car
harmony
saw
it
its
long
flat
roof
black
against
the
dark
sky
its
rows
of
unlighted
windows
its
long
wall
broken
in
the
center
by
the
gate
now
from
across
the
street
its
whole
facade
lay
before
her
peter
lamp
was
not
lighted
but
there
was
a
glow
of
soft
firelight
from
the
salon
windows
the
light
was
not
regular
it
disappeared
at
regular
intervals
was
blotted
out
harmony
knew
what
that
meant
some
one
beyond
range
of
where
she
stood
was
pacing
the
floor
back
and
forward
back
and
forward
when
he
was
worried
or
anxious
peter
always
paced
the
door
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
stood
there
one
of
the
soft
rains
was
falling
or
more
accurately
condensing
the
saturated
air
was
hardly
cold
she
stood
on
the
pavement
unmolested
while
the
glow
died
lower
and
lower
until
at
last
it
was
impossible
to
trace
the
pacing
figure
no
one
came
to
any
of
the
windows
the
little
lamp
before
the
shrine
in
the
shop
burned
itself
out
the
portier
across
the
way
came
to
the
door
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
went
in
harmony
heard
the
rattle
of
the
chain
as
it
was
stretched
across
the
door
inside
not
all
the
windows
of
the
suite
opened
on
the
street
windows
and
peter
opened
toward
the
back
of
the
house
where
in
a
courtyard
the
wife
of
the
portier
hung
her
washing
and
where
the
portier
himself
kept
a
hutch
of
rabbits
a
wild
and
reckless
desire
to
see
at
least
the
light
from
the
child
room
possessed
harmony
even
the
light
would
be
something
to
go
like
this
to
carry
with
her
only
the
memory
of
a
dark
looming
house
without
cheer
was
unthinkable
the
gate
was
never
locked
if
she
but
went
into
the
garden
and
round
by
the
spruce
tree
to
the
back
of
the
house
it
would
be
something
she
knew
the
garden
quite
well
even
the
darkness
had
no
horror
for
her
little
scatchy
had
had
a
habit
of
leaving
various
articles
on
her
and
of
instigating
searches
for
them
at
untimely
hours
of
night
once
they
had
found
her
hairbrush
in
the
rabbit
hutch
so
harmony
ashamed
but
unalarmed
made
her
way
by
the
big
spruce
to
the
corner
of
the
old
lodge
and
thus
to
the
courtyard
ah
this
was
better
lights
all
along
the
apartment
floor
and
moving
shadows
on
jimmy
a
jar
of
milk
and
voices
some
one
was
singing
peter
was
singing
droning
softly
as
one
who
puts
a
drowsy
child
to
sleep
slower
and
slower
softer
and
softer
over
and
over
the
little
song
harmony
had
been
wont
to
sing
ah
well
for
us
all
some
sweet
hope
lies
deeply
buried
from
human
eyes
and
in
the
hereafter
angels
may
roll
the
stone
from
its
grave
slower
and
slower
softer
and
softer
until
it
died
away
altogether
peter
in
his
old
came
to
the
window
and
turned
down
the
gaslight
beside
it
to
a
blue
point
harmony
did
not
breathe
for
a
minute
two
minutes
he
stood
there
looking
out
far
off
the
twin
clocks
of
the
votivkirche
struck
the
hour
all
about
lay
the
lights
of
the
old
city
so
very
old
so
wise
so
cunning
so
cold
peter
stood
looking
out
as
he
had
each
night
since
harmony
went
away
each
night
he
sang
the
boy
to
sleep
turned
down
the
light
and
stood
by
the
window
and
each
night
he
whispered
to
the
city
that
sheltered
harmony
somewhere
what
he
had
whispered
to
the
little
sweater
coat
the
night
before
he
went
away
dear
the
rabbits
stirred
uneasily
in
the
hutch
a
passing
gust
shook
the
great
tree
overhead
and
sent
down
a
sharp
shower
on
to
the
bricks
below
peter
struck
a
match
and
lit
his
pipe
the
flickering
light
illuminated
his
face
his
rough
hair
his
steady
eyes
peter
whispered
harmony

walter
stewart
had
made
an
uncomplicated
recovery
helped
along
by
relief
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
in
a
few
days
he
was
going
about
again
weak
naturally
rather
handsomer
than
before
because
a
little
less
florid
but
the
week
confinement
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
think
over
many
things
peter
had
set
him
thinking
on
the
day
when
he
had
packed
up
the
last
of
marie
small
belongings
and
sent
them
down
to
vienna
stewart
lying
in
bed
had
watched
him
just
how
much
talk
do
you
suppose
this
has
made
byrne
he
asked
have
an
idea
some
probably
the
people
in
the
russian
villa
saw
it
you
stewart
brows
contracted
damnation
then
the
hotel
has
it
of
course
stewart
groaned
peter
closed
marie
american
trunk
of
which
she
had
been
so
proud
and
coming
over
looked
down
at
the
injured
man
do
you
think
you
better
tell
the
girl
all
about
it
no
doggedly
i
know
of
course
it
would
be
easy
but
you
ca
get
away
with
it
stewart
that
one
way
of
looking
at
it
there
what
that
starting
with
a
clean
slate
if
she
the
sort
you
want
to
marry
and
not
a
prude
she
understand
not
at
first
but
after
she
gets
used
to
she
would
understand
in
a
thousand
then
you
better
not
marry
her
you
know
stewart
i
have
an
idea
that
women
imagine
a
good
many
pretty
rotten
things
about
us
anyhow
a
sensible
girl
would
rather
know
the
truth
and
be
done
with
it
what
a
man
has
done
with
his
life
before
a
girl
the
right
girl
comes
into
it
is
a
personal
injury
to
her
since
she
was
a
part
of
his
life
then
you
know
what
i
mean
but
she
has
a
right
to
know
it
before
she
how
many
would
choose
under
those
circumstances
he
jibed
peter
smiled
quite
a
few
he
said
cheerfully
it
a
wrong
system
of
course
but
we
can
get
a
little
truth
out
of
you
ca
get
away
with
it
stuck
in
stewart
mind
for
several
days
it
was
the
one
thing
peter
said
that
did
stick
and
before
stewart
had
recovered
enough
to
be
up
and
about
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
anita
in
his
mind
he
made
quite
a
case
for
himself
he
argued
the
affair
against
his
conscience
and
came
out
victorious
anita
party
had
broken
up
the
winter
sports
did
not
compare
they
complained
with
moritz
they
disliked
german
cooking
into
the
bargain
the
weather
was
not
good
the
night
snows
turned
soft
by
midday
and
the
crowds
that
began
to
throng
the
hotels
were
solid
citizens
not
the
fashionables
of
the
riviera
anita
arm
forbade
her
traveling
in
the
reassembling
of
the
party
she
went
to
the
kurhaus
in
the
valley
below
the
pension
with
one
of
the
women
who
wished
to
take
the
baths
it
was
to
the
kurhaus
then
that
stewart
made
his
first
excursion
after
the
accident
he
went
to
dinner
part
of
the
chaperon
treatment
called
for
an
early
retiring
hour
which
was
highly
as
he
had
wished
it
and
rather
unnerving
after
all
a
man
may
decide
that
a
dose
of
poison
is
the
remedy
for
all
his
troubles
but
he
does
not
approach
his
hour
with
any
hilarity
stewart
was
a
stupid
dinner
guest
ate
very
little
and
looked
haggard
beyond
belief
when
the
hour
came
for
the
older
woman
to
leave
he
did
not
lack
courage
however
it
was
his
great
asset
physical
and
mental
rather
than
moral
but
courage
nevertheless
the
evening
was
quiet
and
they
elected
to
sit
on
the
balcony
outside
anita
sitting
room
the
girl
swathed
in
white
furs
and
leaning
back
in
her
steamer
chair
below
lay
the
terrace
of
the
kurhaus
edged
with
evergreen
trees
beyond
and
far
below
that
was
the
mountain
village
a
few
scattered
houses
along
a
frozen
stream
the
townspeople
retired
early
light
after
light
was
extinguished
until
only
one
in
the
priest
house
remained
a
train
crept
out
of
one
tunnel
and
into
another
like
a
glowing
worm
crawling
from
burrow
to
burrow
the
girl
felt
a
change
in
stewart
during
the
weeks
he
had
known
her
there
had
been
a
curious
restraint
in
his
manner
to
her
there
were
times
when
an
avowal
seemed
to
tremble
on
his
lips
when
his
eyes
looked
into
hers
with
the
look
no
women
ever
mistakes
the
next
moment
he
would
glance
away
his
face
would
harden
they
were
miles
apart
and
perhaps
the
situation
had
piqued
the
girl
certainly
it
had
lost
nothing
for
her
by
its
unusualness
there
was
a
difference
in
the
man
his
eyes
met
hers
squarely
without
evasion
but
with
a
new
quality
a
searching
perhaps
for
something
in
her
to
give
him
courage
the
girl
had
character
more
than
ordinary
decision
it
was
what
stewart
admired
in
her
most
and
the
thing
of
course
that
the
little
marie
had
lacked
moreover
anita
barely
twenty
was
a
woman
not
a
young
girl
her
knowledge
of
the
world
not
so
deep
as
marie
was
more
comprehensive
where
marie
would
have
been
merciful
anita
would
be
just
unless
she
cared
for
him
in
that
case
she
might
be
less
than
just
or
more
anita
in
daylight
was
a
pretty
young
woman
rather
incisive
of
speech
very
intelligent
having
a
wit
without
malice
charming
to
look
at
keenly
alive
anita
in
the
dusk
of
the
balcony
waiting
to
hear
she
knew
not
what
was
a
judicial
white
goddess
formidably
still
frightfully
potential
stewart
who
had
embraced
many
women
did
not
dare
a
finger
on
her
arm
he
had
decided
on
a
way
to
tell
the
girl
the
story
a
preamble
about
his
upbringing
which
had
been
indifferent
his
struggle
to
get
to
vienna
his
loneliness
there
all
leading
with
inevitable
steps
to
marie
from
that
if
she
did
not
utterly
shrink
from
him
to
his
love
for
her
it
was
his
big
hour
that
hour
on
the
balcony
he
was
reaching
through
love
heights
of
honesty
he
had
never
scaled
before
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
reversed
utterly
his
order
of
procedure
the
situation
got
him
this
first
evening
absolutely
alone
with
her
that
and
her
nearness
and
the
pathos
of
her
bandaged
useless
arm
still
he
had
not
touched
her
the
thing
he
was
trying
to
do
was
more
difficult
for
that
general
credulity
to
the
contrary
men
do
not
often
make
spoken
love
first
how
many
men
propose
marriage
to
their
women
across
the
or
from
chair
to
chair
absurd
the
eyes
speak
first
then
the
arms
the
lips
last
the
woman
is
in
his
arms
before
he
tells
his
love
it
is
by
her
response
that
he
gauges
his
chances
and
speaks
of
marriage
actually
the
thing
is
already
settled
tardy
speech
only
follows
on
swift
instinct
stewart
wooing
as
men
woo
would
have
taken
the
girl
hand
gained
an
encouragement
from
it
ventured
to
kiss
it
perhaps
and
finding
no
rebuff
would
then
and
there
have
crushed
her
to
him
what
need
of
words
they
would
follow
in
due
time
not
to
make
a
situation
but
to
clarify
it
but
he
could
not
woo
as
men
woo
the
barrier
of
his
own
weakness
stood
between
them
and
must
be
painfully
taken
down
i
afraid
this
is
stupid
for
you
said
anita
out
of
the
silence
would
you
like
to
go
to
the
god
forbid
i
was
of
what
encouragement
this
surely
i
was
thinking
how
you
had
come
into
my
life
and
stirred
it
really
i
you
know
how
did
i
stir
it
up
that
hardly
the
way
i
meant
to
put
it
you
changed
everything
for
me
i
care
for
you
a
very
great
he
was
still
carefully
in
hand
his
voice
steady
and
still
he
did
not
touch
her
other
men
had
made
love
to
her
but
never
in
this
fashion
or
was
he
making
love
i
very
glad
you
like
like
you
almost
out
of
hand
that
time
the
thrill
in
his
voice
was
unmistakable
it
much
more
than
that
anita
so
much
more
that
going
to
try
to
do
a
hideously
hard
thing
will
you
help
a
little
yes
if
i
she
was
stirred
too
and
rather
frightened
stewart
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
her
and
sat
forward
his
face
set
and
dogged
have
you
any
idea
how
you
were
hurt
or
why
no
there
a
certain
proportion
of
accidents
that
occur
at
all
these
places
is
there
this
was
not
an
no
the
branch
of
a
tree
was
thrown
out
in
front
of
the
sled
to
send
us
over
the
bank
it
was
murder
if
intention
is
after
a
brief
silence
somebody
who
wished
to
kill
you
or
me
both
of
us
i
believe
it
was
done
by
a
woman
a
girl
anita
a
girl
i
had
been
living
a
brutal
way
to
tell
her
no
doubt
but
admirably
courageous
for
he
was
quivering
with
dread
when
he
said
it
the
courage
of
the
man
who
faces
a
cannon
and
here
where
a
woman
would
have
broken
into
speech
anita
took
the
refuge
of
her
kind
and
was
silent
stewart
watched
her
as
best
he
could
in
the
darkness
trying
to
gather
further
courage
to
go
on
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
her
fingers
touching
the
edge
of
the
chair
quivered
may
i
tell
you
the
rest
i
do
think
i
want
to
hear
are
you
going
to
condemn
me
unheard
there
is
anything
you
can
say
against
the
fact
but
there
was
much
to
say
and
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
he
made
his
plea
he
made
no
attempt
to
put
his
case
he
told
what
had
happened
simply
he
told
of
his
loneliness
and
discomfort
and
he
emphasized
the
lack
of
sentiment
that
prompted
the
arrangement
anita
spoke
then
for
the
first
time
and
when
you
tried
to
terminate
it
she
attempted
to
kill
you
i
was
acting
the
beast
i
brought
her
up
here
and
then
neglected
her
for
then
it
was
hardly
only
a
business
arrangement
for
it
was
at
first
i
never
dreamed
of
any
thing
else
i
swear
that
anita
but
lately
in
the
last
month
or
two
she
i
suppose
i
should
have
seen
that
she
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
you
how
old
is
she
a
sudden
memory
came
to
anita
of
a
slim
young
girl
who
had
watched
her
with
wide
almost
childish
eyes
then
it
was
she
who
was
in
the
compartment
with
you
on
the
train
coming
up
where
is
she
now
in
vienna
i
have
not
heard
from
her
byrne
the
chap
who
came
up
to
see
me
after
the
after
the
accident
sent
her
away
i
think
looking
after
her
i
have
heard
from
why
did
you
tell
me
all
this
because
i
love
you
anita
i
want
you
to
marry
what
after
that
that
or
something
similar
is
in
many
men
lives
they
do
tell
it
that
the
difference
i
not
taking
any
credit
for
telling
you
this
i
ashamed
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
and
when
i
look
at
your
bandaged
arm
i
suicidal
peter
byrne
urged
me
to
tell
you
he
said
i
get
away
with
it
some
time
or
other
it
would
come
out
then
he
said
something
else
he
said
you
probably
understand
and
that
if
you
married
me
it
was
better
to
start
with
a
clean
no
love
no
passion
in
the
interview
now
a
clear
statement
of
fact
an
offer
his
past
against
hers
his
future
with
hers
her
hand
was
steady
now
the
light
in
the
priest
house
had
been
extinguished
the
chill
of
the
mountain
night
penetrated
anita
white
furs
and
set
her
or
was
it
the
chill
to
shivering
if
i
had
not
told
you
would
you
have
married
me
i
think
so
i
be
honest
too
i
am
the
same
man
you
would
have
married
only
more
i
can
not
argue
about
it
i
am
tired
and
stewart
glanced
across
the
valley
to
where
the
cluster
of
villas
hugged
the
there
was
a
light
in
his
room
outside
was
the
little
balcony
where
marie
had
leaned
against
the
railing
and
looked
down
down
some
of
the
arrogance
of
his
new
virtue
left
the
man
he
was
suddenly
humbled
for
the
first
time
he
realized
a
part
of
what
marie
had
endured
in
that
small
room
where
the
light
burned
poor
little
marie
he
said
softly
the
involuntary
exclamation
did
more
for
him
than
any
plea
he
could
have
made
anita
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
go
and
see
her
she
said
quietly
you
owe
her
that
we
be
leaving
here
in
a
day
or
so
and
i
not
see
you
again
but
you
been
honest
and
i
will
be
honest
too
i
i
cared
a
great
deal
and
this
has
killed
it
i
hardly
comprehend
it
yet
i
shall
have
to
have
time
to
but
if
you
are
going
away
i
afraid
to
leave
you
you
think
this
thing
over
alone
and
all
the
rules
of
life
you
been
taught
will
come
please
i
must
think
i
will
write
you
i
he
caught
her
hand
and
crushed
it
between
both
of
his
i
suppose
you
would
rather
i
did
not
kiss
you
humbly
i
do
not
want
you
to
kiss
he
released
her
hand
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
in
the
darkness
if
he
could
only
have
crushed
her
to
him
made
her
feel
the
security
of
his
love
of
his
sheltering
arms
but
the
barrier
of
his
own
building
was
between
them
his
voice
was
husky
i
want
you
to
try
to
remember
past
what
i
have
told
you
to
the
thing
that
concerns
us
both
i
love
you
i
never
loved
the
other
woman
i
never
pretended
i
loved
her
and
there
will
be
nothing
more
like
i
shall
try
to
anita
left
semmering
the
next
day
against
the
protests
of
the
doctor
and
the
pleadings
of
the
chaperon
she
did
not
see
stewart
again
but
before
she
left
with
the
luggage
gone
and
the
fiacre
at
the
door
she
went
out
on
the
terrace
and
looked
across
to
the
villa
waldheim
rising
from
among
its
clustering
trees
although
it
was
too
far
to
be
certain
she
thought
she
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
on
the
little
balcony
standing
with
folded
arms
gazing
across
the
valley
to
the
kurhaus
having
promised
to
see
marie
stewart
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
promise
in
his
direct
fashion
he
left
semmering
the
evening
of
the
following
day
for
vienna
the
strain
of
the
confession
was
over
but
he
was
a
victim
of
sickening
dread
to
one
thing
only
he
dared
to
pin
his
hopes
anita
had
said
she
cared
cared
a
great
deal
and
after
all
what
else
mattered
the
story
had
been
a
jolt
he
told
himself
girls
were
full
of
queer
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
bless
them
but
she
cared
she
cared
he
arrived
in
vienna
at
nine
that
night
the
imminence
of
his
interview
with
marie
hung
over
him
like
a
cloud
he
ate
a
hurried
supper
and
calling
up
the
doctors
club
by
telephone
found
address
in
the
siebensternstrasse
he
had
no
idea
of
course
that
marie
was
there
he
wanted
to
see
peter
to
learn
where
marie
had
taken
refuge
and
incidentally
to
get
from
peter
a
fresh
supply
of
moral
courage
for
the
interview
for
he
needed
courage
in
vain
on
the
journey
down
had
he
clothed
himself
in
armor
of
wrath
against
the
girl
the
very
compartment
in
the
train
provoked
softened
memories
of
her
here
they
had
bought
a
luncheon
there
marie
had
first
seen
the
rax
again
at
this
station
she
had
curled
up
and
put
her
head
on
his
shoulder
for
a
nap
ah
but
again
at
this
part
of
the
journey
he
had
first
seen
anita
he
took
a
car
to
the
siebensternstrasse
his
idea
of
peter
manner
of
living
those
days
was
exceedingly
vague
he
had
respected
reticence
after
the
manner
of
men
with
each
other
peter
had
once
mentioned
a
boy
he
was
looking
after
in
excuse
for
leaving
so
soon
after
the
accident
that
was
all
the
house
on
the
siebensternstrasse
loomed
large
and
unlighted
the
street
was
dark
and
it
was
only
after
a
search
that
stewart
found
the
gate
even
then
he
lost
the
path
and
found
himself
among
a
group
of
trees
to
touch
the
lowest
branches
of
any
of
which
resulted
in
a
shower
of
raindrops
to
add
to
his
discomfort
some
one
was
walking
in
the
garden
coming
toward
him
with
light
almost
stealthy
steps
stewart
by
his
tree
stood
still
waiting
the
steps
approached
were
very
close
were
beside
him
so
intense
was
the
darkness
that
even
then
all
he
saw
was
a
blacker
shadow
and
that
was
visible
only
because
it
moved
then
a
hand
touched
his
arm
stopped
as
if
paralyzed
drew
back
slowly
fearfully
good
heavens
said
poor
harmony
faintly
please
do
be
alarmed
i
have
lost
the
stewart
voice
was
almost
equally
nervous
is
it
to
the
right
or
the
left
it
was
a
moment
before
harmony
had
breath
to
speak
then
to
the
right
a
dozen
paces
or
thank
you
perhaps
i
can
help
you
to
find
i
know
it
quite
well
please
do
the
whole
situation
was
so
unexpected
that
only
then
did
it
dawn
on
stewart
that
this
blacker
shadow
was
a
countrywoman
speaking
god
own
language
together
harmony
a
foot
or
so
in
advance
they
made
the
path
the
house
is
there
ring
hard
the
bell
is
out
of
are
you
not
coming
in
no
i
i
do
not
live
she
must
have
gone
just
after
that
stewart
glancing
at
the
dark
facade
of
the
house
turned
round
to
find
her
gone
and
a
moment
later
heard
the
closing
of
the
gate
he
was
bewildered
what
sort
of
curious
place
was
this
a
great
looming
house
that
concealed
in
its
garden
a
fugitive
american
girl
who
came
and
went
like
a
shadow
leaving
only
the
memory
of
a
sweet
voice
strained
with
fright
stewart
was
full
of
his
encounter
as
he
took
the
candle
the
portier
gave
him
and
followed
the
gentleman
gruff
directions
up
the
staircase
peter
admitted
him
looking
a
trifle
uneasy
as
well
he
might
with
marie
in
the
salon
stewart
was
too
preoccupied
to
notice
peter
expression
he
shook
the
rain
off
his
hat
smiling
how
are
you
asked
peter
dutifully
pretty
good
except
for
a
headache
when
i
tired
what
sort
of
a
place
have
you
got
here
anyhow
byrne
old
of
maria
theresa
replied
peter
still
preoccupied
with
marie
and
what
was
coming
rather
interesting
old
rather
commented
stewart
with
goddesses
in
the
garden
and
all
the
usual
goddesses
ran
into
one
just
now
among
the
trees
woman
i
forswore
but
thou
being
a
goddess
i
forswore
not
thee
goddess
by
george
peter
was
staring
at
him
incredulously
now
he
bent
forward
and
grasped
his
arm
in
fingers
of
steel
for
heaven
sake
stewart
tell
me
what
you
mean
who
was
in
the
garden
stewart
was
amused
and
interested
it
was
not
for
him
to
belittle
a
situation
of
his
own
making
an
incident
of
his
own
telling
i
lost
my
way
in
your
garden
wandered
among
the
trees
broke
through
a
hedgerow
or
two
struck
a
match
and
consulted
the
compass
peter
fingers
closed
quick
he
said
stewart
manner
lost
its
jauntiness
there
was
a
girl
there
he
said
shortly
could
see
her
she
spoke
english
said
she
did
live
here
and
broke
for
the
gate
the
minute
i
got
to
the
you
did
see
her
no
nice
voice
though
the
next
moment
he
was
alone
peter
in
his
was
running
down
the
staircase
to
the
lower
floor
was
shouting
to
the
portier
to
unlock
the
door
was
a
madman
in
everything
but
purpose
the
portier
let
him
out
and
returned
to
the
bedroom
the
boy
above
is
worse
he
said
briefly
a
strange
doctor
has
just
come
and
but
now
the
herr
doktor
byrne
runs
to
the
drug
the
portier
wife
shrugged
her
shoulders
even
while
tears
filled
her
eyes
what
can
one
expect
she
demanded
the
good
herr
gott
has
forbidden
theft
and
rosa
says
the
boy
was
stolen
also
the
druggist
has
gone
to
visit
his
wife
perhaps
i
may
be
of
service
i
shall
go
and
see
for
a
moment
that
hussy
of
the
streets
remain
here
i
shall
slowly
and
ponderously
she
climbed
the
stairs
stewart
left
alone
wandered
along
the
dim
corridor
he
found
excitement
rather
amusing
so
this
was
where
peter
lived
an
old
house
isolated
in
a
garden
where
rambled
young
women
with
soft
voices
hello
a
youngster
asleep
the
boy
no
doubt
he
wandered
on
toward
the
lighted
door
of
the
salon
and
marie
the
place
was
warm
and
comfortable
but
over
it
all
hung
the
indescribable
odor
of
drugs
that
meant
illness
he
remembered
that
the
boy
was
frail
marie
turned
as
he
stopped
in
the
salon
doorway
and
then
rose
across
the
wide
spaces
of
the
room
they
eyed
each
other
marie
crisis
had
come
like
all
crises
it
was
bigger
than
speech
it
was
after
a
distinct
pause
that
she
spoke
hast
thou
brought
the
police
curiously
human
curiously
masculine
at
least
was
stewart
mental
condition
at
that
moment
he
had
never
loved
the
girl
it
was
with
tremendous
relief
he
had
put
her
out
of
his
life
and
yet
so
it
old
peter
now
is
it
no
no
not
that
walter
he
has
given
me
shelter
that
is
all
i
swear
it
i
look
after
the
who
else
is
here
no
one
else
but
tell
that
rot
to
some
one
who
does
not
know
it
is
true
he
never
even
looks
at
me
i
am
wicked
but
i
do
not
there
was
a
catch
of
hope
in
her
voice
marie
knew
men
somewhat
but
she
still
cherished
the
feminine
belief
that
jealousy
is
love
whereas
it
is
only
injured
pride
she
took
a
step
toward
him
walter
i
am
sorry
do
you
hate
me
she
had
dropped
the
familiar
stewart
crossed
the
room
until
only
peter
table
and
lamp
stood
between
them
i
did
mean
to
be
brutal
he
said
rather
largely
entirely
conscious
of
his
own
magnanimity
it
was
pretty
bad
up
there
and
i
know
it
i
do
hate
you
of
course
that
hardly
possible
after
you
would
take
me
back
no
it
over
marie
i
wanted
to
know
where
you
were
that
all
to
see
that
you
were
comfortable
and
not
frightened
you
a
silly
child
to
think
of
the
marie
put
a
hand
to
her
throat
it
is
the
american
of
she
staggered
a
trifle
recovered
threw
up
her
head
then
i
wish
i
had
killed
her
no
man
ever
violently
resents
the
passionate
hate
of
one
woman
for
her
rival
in
his
affections
stewart
finding
the
situation
in
hand
and
marie
only
feebly
formidable
was
rather
amused
and
flattered
by
the
honest
fury
in
her
voice
the
mouse
was
under
his
paw
he
would
play
a
bit
you
get
over
feeling
that
way
kid
you
do
really
love
you
were
my
god
that
is
will
you
let
me
help
you
money
i
mean
keep
it
for
peter
will
be
here
in
a
he
bent
over
the
table
and
eyed
her
with
his
old
manner
come
round
here
and
kiss
me
for
old
no
she
stood
stubbornly
still
and
stewart
still
smiling
took
a
step
or
two
toward
her
then
he
stopped
ceased
smiling
drew
himself
up
you
are
quite
right
and
i
a
marie
english
did
not
comprehend
rotter
but
she
knew
the
tone
listen
marie
i
told
the
other
girl
and
there
a
chance
for
me
anyhow
some
day
she
may
marry
me
she
asked
me
to
see
i
do
not
wish
her
you
are
wasting
your
life
here
you
can
not
marry
you
say
without
a
dot
there
is
a
chance
in
america
for
a
clever
girl
you
are
clever
little
marie
the
first
money
i
can
spare
i
send
you
if
you
take
it
it
all
i
can
this
was
a
new
stewart
a
man
she
had
never
known
marie
recoiled
from
him
eyed
him
nervously
sought
in
her
childish
mind
for
an
explanation
when
at
last
she
understood
that
he
was
sincere
she
broke
down
stewart
playing
a
new
part
and
raw
in
it
found
the
situation
irritating
but
marie
tears
were
not
entirely
bitter
back
of
them
her
busy
young
mind
was
weaving
a
new
warp
of
life
with
all
of
america
for
its
loom
hope
that
had
died
lived
again
before
her
already
lay
that
great
country
where
women
might
labor
and
live
by
the
fruit
of
their
labor
where
her
tawdry
past
would
be
buried
in
the
center
of
distant
europe
new
life
beckoned
to
the
little
marie
that
night
in
the
old
salon
of
maria
theresa
beckoned
to
her
as
it
called
to
stewart
opportunity
to
one
love
and
work
to
the
other
to
america
i
will
go
she
said
at
last
simply
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
good
stewart
held
out
his
hand
and
marie
took
it
with
a
quick
gesture
she
held
it
to
her
cheek
dropped
it
peter
came
back
half
an
hour
later
downcast
but
not
hopeless
he
had
not
found
harmony
but
life
was
not
all
gray
she
was
well
still
in
vienna
and
she
had
come
back
she
had
cared
then
enough
to
come
back
he
would
commence
again
would
comb
the
city
fine
and
when
he
had
found
her
he
would
bring
her
back
the
wanderer
to
a
marvelous
welcome
he
found
stewart
gone
and
marie
feverishly
overhauling
her
few
belongings
by
the
salon
lamp
she
turned
to
him
a
face
still
stained
with
tears
but
radiant
with
hope
peter
she
said
gravely
i
must
prepare
my
outfit
i
go
to
with
stewart
alone
peter
to
work
to
be
very
good
to
be
something
i
am
very
happy
although
peter
may
i
kiss
you
certainly
said
peter
and
took
her
caress
gravely
patting
her
thin
shoulder
his
thoughts
were
in
the
garden
with
harmony
who
had
cared
enough
to
come
back
life
said
peter
soberly
life
is
just
one
damned
thing
after
another
is
it
but
marie
was
anxiously
examining
the
hem
of
a
skirt
the
letter
from
anita
reached
stewart
the
following
morning
she
said
i
have
been
thinking
things
over
walter
and
i
am
going
to
hurt
you
very
much
but
not
believe
me
without
hurting
myself
perhaps
my
uppermost
thought
just
now
is
that
i
am
disappointing
you
that
i
am
not
so
big
as
you
thought
i
would
be
for
now
in
this
final
letter
i
can
tell
you
how
much
i
cared
oh
my
dear
i
did
care
but
i
will
not
marry
you
and
when
this
reaches
you
i
shall
have
gone
very
quietly
out
of
your
life
i
find
that
such
philosophy
as
i
have
does
not
support
me
that
all
my
little
rules
of
life
are
inadequate
individual
liberty
was
one
but
there
is
no
liberty
of
the
individual
life
other
lives
press
too
closely
you
living
your
life
as
seemed
best
and
easiest
and
carrying
down
with
you
into
shipwreck
the
little
marie
and
myself
for
face
to
face
with
the
fact
i
can
not
accept
it
walter
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
my
past
against
yours
it
is
of
steady
revolt
and
loathing
of
the
whole
thing
not
the
flash
of
protest
before
one
succumbs
to
the
inevitable
but
a
hatred
that
is
a
part
of
me
and
that
would
never
forget
you
say
that
you
are
the
same
man
i
would
have
married
only
more
honest
for
concealing
nothing
but
and
forgive
me
this
it
insists
on
coming
up
in
my
mind
were
you
honest
really
you
told
me
and
it
took
courage
but
was
it
partly
fear
what
motive
is
unmixed
honesty
and
fear
walter
you
were
preparing
against
a
contingency
although
you
may
not
admit
this
to
yourself
i
am
not
passing
judgment
on
you
god
forbid
that
i
should
i
am
only
trying
to
show
you
what
is
in
my
mind
and
that
this
break
is
final
the
revolt
is
in
myself
against
something
sordid
and
horrible
which
i
will
not
take
into
my
life
and
for
that
reason
time
will
make
no
difference
i
am
not
a
child
and
i
am
not
unreasonable
but
i
ask
a
great
deal
of
this
life
of
mine
that
stretches
ahead
walter
home
and
children
the
love
of
a
good
man
the
fulfillment
of
my
ideals
and
you
ask
me
to
start
with
a
handicap
i
can
not
do
it
i
know
you
are
resentful
but
i
know
that
you
understand
chapter
xxv
the
little
georgiev
was
in
trouble
those
days
the
balkan
engine
was
threatening
to
explode
but
continued
to
gather
steam
with
bulgaria
sitting
on
the
austria
was
mobilizing
troops
and
there
were
long
conferences
in
the
burg
between
the
emperor
and
various
bearded
gentlemen
while
the
military
prayed
in
the
churches
for
war
the
little
georgiev
hardly
ate
or
slept
much
hammering
went
on
all
day
in
the
small
room
below
harmony
on
the
wollbadgasse
at
night
when
the
man
in
the
green
velours
hat
took
a
little
sleep
mysterious
packages
were
carried
down
the
whitewashed
staircase
and
loaded
into
wagons
waiting
below
once
on
her
harmony
found
among
the
pigeons
a
carrier
pigeon
with
a
brass
tube
fastened
to
its
leg
on
the
morning
after
harmony
flight
from
the
garden
in
the
street
of
seven
stars
she
received
a
visit
from
georgiev
she
had
put
in
a
sleepless
night
full
of
she
charged
herself
with
cowardice
in
running
away
from
peter
and
jimmy
when
they
needed
her
and
in
going
back
like
a
thief
the
night
before
the
conviction
that
the
boy
was
not
so
well
brought
with
it
additional
introspection
her
sacrifice
seemed
useless
almost
childish
she
had
fled
because
two
men
thought
it
necessary
in
order
to
save
her
reputation
to
marry
her
and
she
did
not
wish
to
marry
marriage
was
fatal
to
the
career
she
had
promised
herself
had
been
promised
but
this
career
for
which
she
had
given
up
everything
else
would
she
find
it
in
the
workroom
of
a
dressmaker
ah
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
suppose
how
her
cheeks
burned
when
she
thought
of
it
suppose
she
had
taken
peter
at
his
word
and
married
him
what
about
peter
career
was
there
any
way
by
which
peter
poverty
for
one
would
be
comfort
for
two
was
there
any
reason
why
peter
with
his
splendid
ability
should
settle
down
to
the
of
general
practice
the
very
slough
out
of
which
he
had
so
painfully
climbed
either
of
two
things
go
back
to
peter
but
not
to
marry
him
or
stay
where
she
was
how
she
longed
to
go
back
only
harmony
knew
there
in
the
little
room
with
only
the
pigeons
to
see
she
held
out
her
arms
longingly
peter
she
said
peter
dear
she
decided
of
course
to
stay
where
she
was
a
burden
to
no
one
the
instinct
of
the
young
girl
to
preserve
her
good
name
at
any
cost
outweighed
the
vision
of
peter
at
the
window
haggard
and
tired
looking
out
it
was
harmony
chance
perhaps
to
do
a
big
thing
to
prove
herself
bigger
than
her
fears
stronger
than
convention
but
she
was
young
bewildered
afraid
and
there
was
this
element
stronger
than
any
of
the
others
peter
had
never
told
her
he
loved
her
to
go
back
throwing
herself
again
on
his
mercy
was
unthinkable
on
his
love
that
was
different
but
what
if
he
did
not
love
her
he
had
been
good
to
her
but
then
peter
was
good
to
every
one
there
was
something
else
if
the
boy
was
worse
what
about
his
mother
whatever
she
was
or
had
been
she
was
his
mother
suppose
he
were
to
die
and
his
mother
not
see
him
harmony
sense
of
fairness
rebelled
in
the
small
community
at
home
mother
was
sacred
her
claims
insistent
it
was
very
early
hardly
more
than
dawn
the
pigeons
cooed
on
the
sill
over
the
ridge
of
the
church
roof
across
a
luminous
strip
foretold
the
sun
an
oxcart
laden
with
vegetables
for
the
market
lumbered
along
the
streets
puzzled
and
unhappy
harmony
rose
and
lighted
her
fire
drew
on
her
slippers
and
the
faded
silk
kimono
with
the
pink
butterflies
in
the
next
room
the
dressmaker
still
slept
dreaming
early
morning
dreams
of
lazy
apprentices
overdue
bills
complaining
customers
harmony
moved
lightly
not
to
disturb
her
she
set
her
room
in
order
fed
the
pigeons
it
was
then
she
saw
the
carrier
with
its
message
made
her
morning
coffee
by
setting
the
tiny
pot
inside
the
stove
and
all
the
time
moving
quietly
through
her
morning
routine
she
was
there
in
that
upper
room
in
body
only
in
soul
she
was
again
in
the
courtyard
back
of
the
old
lodge
in
the
street
of
seven
stars
with
the
rabbits
stirring
in
the
hutch
and
peter
with
rapt
eyes
gazing
out
over
the
city
bed
peter
pigeons
rolls
peter
sunrise
over
the
church
roof
and
peter
again
always
peter
monia
reiff
was
stirring
in
the
next
room
harmony
could
hear
her
muttering
and
putting
coal
on
the
stove
and
calling
to
the
hungarian
maid
for
breakfast
harmony
dressed
hastily
it
was
one
of
her
new
duties
to
prepare
the
workroom
for
the
day
the
luminous
streak
above
the
church
was
rose
now
time
for
the
day
to
begin
she
was
not
certain
at
once
that
some
one
had
knocked
at
the
door
so
faint
was
the
sound
she
hesitated
listened
the
knob
turned
slightly
harmony
expecting
monia
called
come
it
was
the
little
georgiev
very
apologetic
rather
gray
of
face
he
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
one
ear
toward
the
stairway
it
was
very
silent
monia
was
drinking
her
coffee
in
bed
whither
she
had
retired
for
warmth
pardon
said
the
bulgarian
in
a
whisper
i
listened
until
i
heard
you
moving
about
ah
fraulein
that
i
must
disturb
you
something
has
happened
exclaimed
harmony
thinking
of
peter
of
course
not
yet
i
fear
it
is
about
to
happen
fraulein
do
me
the
honor
to
open
your
window
my
pigeon
comes
now
to
you
to
be
fed
and
i
fear
on
the
sill
harmony
opened
the
window
the
wild
pigeons
scattered
at
once
but
the
carrier
flying
out
a
foot
or
two
came
back
promptly
and
set
about
its
breakfast
will
he
let
me
catch
him
pardon
fraulein
if
i
may
enter
come
in
of
evidently
the
defection
of
the
carrier
had
been
serious
a
handful
of
grain
on
a
wrong
and
kingdoms
overthrown
georgiev
caught
the
pigeon
and
drew
the
message
from
the
tube
even
harmony
grasped
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
the
little
bulgarian
face
from
gray
became
livid
tiny
beads
of
cold
sweat
came
out
on
his
forehead
what
have
i
done
cried
harmony
oh
what
have
i
done
if
i
had
known
about
the
pigeon
georgiev
recovered
himself
the
fraulein
can
do
nothing
wrong
he
said
it
is
a
matter
of
an
hour
delay
that
is
all
it
may
not
be
too
monia
reiff
from
the
next
room
called
loudly
for
more
coffee
the
sulky
hungarian
brought
it
without
a
glance
in
their
direction
too
late
for
what
fraulein
if
i
may
trouble
you
but
glance
from
the
window
to
the
street
below
it
is
of
an
urgency
or
i
please
fraulein
harmony
glanced
down
into
the
of
the
street
georgiev
behind
her
watched
her
breathless
expectant
harmony
drew
in
her
head
only
a
man
in
a
green
hat
she
said
and
down
the
street
a
group
of
ah
the
situation
dawned
on
the
girl
then
at
least
partially
they
are
coming
for
you
it
is
possible
but
there
are
many
soldiers
in
and
i
with
the
pigeon
oh
it
too
horrible
herr
georgiev
stay
here
in
this
room
lock
the
door
monia
will
say
that
it
is
mine
ah
no
fraulein
it
is
quite
hopeless
nor
is
it
a
matter
of
the
pigeon
it
is
war
fraulein
do
not
distress
yourself
it
is
but
a
matter
of
there
must
be
something
i
can
do
desperately
i
hear
them
below
is
there
no
way
to
the
roof
no
escape
none
fraulein
it
was
an
oversight
war
is
not
my
game
i
am
a
man
of
peace
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
fraulein
i
thank
you
are
not
going
down
pardon
but
it
is
better
so
soldiers
they
are
of
the
provinces
mostly
and
not
for
a
lady
to
they
are
coming
up
he
listened
the
clank
of
scabbards
against
the
stone
stairs
was
unmistakable
the
little
georgiev
straightened
threw
out
his
chest
turned
to
descend
faltered
came
back
a
step
or
two
his
small
black
eyes
were
fixed
on
harmony
face
fraulein
he
said
huskily
you
are
very
lovely
i
carry
always
in
my
heart
your
image
always
so
long
as
i
live
he
drew
his
heels
together
gave
a
stiff
little
bow
and
was
gone
down
the
staircase
harmony
was
frightened
stricken
she
collapsed
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
of
her
room
her
fingers
in
her
ears
but
she
need
not
have
feared
the
little
georgiev
made
no
protest
submitted
to
the
inevitable
like
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
went
out
of
her
life
indeed
as
unobtrusively
as
he
had
entered
it
the
carrier
pigeon
preened
itself
comfortably
on
the
edge
of
the
washstand
harmony
ceased
her
hysterical
crying
at
last
and
pondered
what
was
best
to
do
monia
was
still
breakfasting
so
incredibly
brief
are
great
moments
after
a
little
thought
harmony
wrote
a
tiny
message
english
german
and
french
and
inclosed
it
in
the
brass
tube
the
herr
georgiev
has
been
arrested
she
wrote
an
hour
later
the
carrier
rose
lazily
from
the
flapped
its
way
over
the
church
roof
and
disappeared
like
georgiev
out
of
her
life
war
had
touched
her
and
passed
on
the
incident
was
not
entirely
closed
however
a
search
of
the
building
followed
the
capture
of
the
little
spy
protesting
tenants
were
turned
out
beds
were
dismantled
closets
searched
walls
sounded
for
hidden
hollows
in
one
room
on
harmony
floor
was
found
stored
a
quantity
of
ammunition
it
was
when
the
three
men
who
had
conducted
the
search
had
finished
when
the
boxes
of
ammunition
had
been
gathered
in
the
hall
and
the
chattering
had
gone
back
to
work
that
harmony
on
her
way
to
her
dismantled
room
passed
through
the
upper
passage
she
glanced
down
the
staircase
where
little
georgiev
had
so
manfully
descended
i
carry
always
in
my
heart
your
image
always
so
long
as
i
the
clatter
of
soldiers
on
their
way
down
to
the
street
came
to
her
ears
the
soft
cooing
of
the
pigeons
the
whirr
of
from
the
workroom
the
incident
was
closed
except
for
the
heap
of
ammunition
boxes
on
the
landing
guarded
by
an
impassive
soldier
harmony
glanced
at
him
he
was
eying
her
steadily
thumbs
in
heels
in
toes
out
chest
out
harmony
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
you
she
said
the
conversation
of
a
sentry
save
on
a
holiday
is
yea
yea
and
nay
yes
harmony
put
her
hands
together
a
little
gesture
of
appeal
infinitely
touching
you
will
not
say
that
you
have
found
have
seen
me
no
it
was
in
harmony
mind
to
ask
all
her
hungry
heart
craved
to
learn
of
peter
of
jimmy
of
the
portier
of
anything
that
belonged
to
the
old
life
in
the
siebensternstrasse
but
there
was
no
time
the
impassive
face
became
rigid
he
looked
through
her
not
at
her
harmony
turned
the
man
in
the
green
hat
was
coming
up
the
staircase
there
was
no
further
chance
to
question
the
sentry
was
set
to
carrying
the
boxes
down
the
staircase
full
morning
now
with
the
winter
sun
shining
on
the
beggars
in
the
market
on
the
crowds
in
the
parks
on
the
flower
sellers
in
the
stephansplatz
shining
on
harmony
golden
head
as
she
bent
over
a
bit
of
chiffon
on
the
old
milkwoman
carrying
up
the
whitewashed
staircase
her
heavy
cans
of
milk
on
the
carrier
pigeon
winging
its
way
to
the
south
beating
in
through
bars
to
the
exalted
face
of
herr
georgiev
resting
on
peter
drooping
shoulders
on
the
neglected
mice
and
the
wooden
soldier
on
the
closed
eyes
of
a
sick
child
the
worshiped
sun
peering
forth
the
golden
window
of
the
east
chapter
xxvi
jimmy
was
dying
peter
fighting
hard
was
beaten
at
last
all
through
the
night
he
had
felt
it
during
the
hours
before
the
dawn
there
had
been
times
when
the
small
pulse
wavered
flickered
almost
ceased
with
the
daylight
there
had
been
a
trifle
of
recovery
enough
for
a
bit
of
hope
enough
to
make
harder
peter
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
the
boy
was
very
happy
quite
content
and
comfortable
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
smiled
at
peter
and
peter
gray
of
face
smiled
back
peter
died
many
deaths
that
night
at
daylight
jimmy
fell
into
a
sleep
that
was
really
stupor
marie
creeping
to
the
door
in
the
faint
dawn
found
the
boy
apparently
asleep
and
peter
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
he
raised
his
head
at
her
footstep
and
the
girl
was
startled
at
the
suffering
in
his
face
he
motioned
her
back
but
you
must
have
a
little
sleep
no
i
stay
until
go
back
to
bed
it
is
very
peter
had
not
been
able
after
all
to
secure
the
nurse
elisabet
and
now
it
was
useless
at
eight
he
let
marie
take
his
place
then
he
bathed
and
dressed
and
prepared
to
face
another
day
perhaps
another
night
for
the
child
release
came
slowly
he
tried
to
eat
breakfast
but
managed
only
a
cup
of
coffee
many
things
had
come
to
peter
in
the
long
night
and
one
was
insistent
the
boy
mother
was
in
vienna
and
he
was
dying
without
her
peter
might
know
in
his
heart
that
he
had
done
the
best
thing
for
the
child
but
like
harmony
his
early
training
was
rising
now
to
accuse
him
he
had
separated
mother
and
child
who
was
he
to
have
decided
the
mother
unfitness
to
have
played
destiny
how
lightly
he
had
taken
the
lives
of
others
in
his
hand
and
to
what
end
harmony
god
knows
where
the
boy
dying
without
his
mother
whatever
that
mother
might
be
her
place
that
day
was
with
her
boy
what
a
wreck
he
had
made
of
things
he
was
humbled
as
well
as
stricken
poor
peter
in
the
morning
he
sent
a
note
to
mclean
asking
him
to
try
to
trace
the
mother
and
inclosing
the
clipping
and
the
letter
the
letter
signed
only
mamma
was
not
helpful
the
clipping
might
prove
valuable
and
for
heaven
sake
be
quick
wrote
peter
this
is
a
matter
of
hours
i
meant
well
but
i
done
a
terrible
thing
bring
her
mac
no
matter
what
she
is
or
where
you
find
the
portier
carried
the
note
when
he
came
up
to
get
it
he
brought
in
his
pocket
a
small
rabbit
and
a
lettuce
leaf
never
before
had
the
combination
failed
to
arouse
and
amuse
the
boy
he
carried
the
rabbit
down
again
sorrowfully
he
saw
it
not
he
reported
sadly
to
his
wife
be
off
to
the
church
while
i
deliver
this
letter
and
this
rabbit
we
will
not
cook
but
keep
in
at
eleven
marie
called
peter
who
was
asleep
on
the
horsehair
sofa
he
asks
for
peter
was
instantly
awake
and
on
his
feet
the
boy
eyes
were
open
and
fixed
on
him
is
it
another
day
he
asked
yes
boy
another
i
am
cold
they
blanketed
him
although
the
room
was
warm
from
where
he
lay
he
could
see
the
mice
he
watched
them
for
a
moment
poor
peter
very
humble
found
himself
wondering
in
how
many
ways
he
had
been
remiss
to
see
this
small
soul
launched
into
eternity
without
a
foreword
without
a
bit
of
light
for
the
journey
peter
religion
had
been
one
of
life
and
living
not
of
creed
marie
bringing
jugs
of
hot
water
bent
over
peter
he
knows
poor
little
one
she
whispered
and
so
indeed
it
would
seem
the
boy
revived
by
a
spoonful
or
two
of
broth
asked
to
have
the
two
tame
mice
on
the
bed
peter
opening
the
cage
found
one
dead
very
stiff
and
stark
the
catastrophe
he
kept
from
the
boy
one
is
sick
jimmy
boy
he
said
and
placed
the
mate
forlorn
and
shivering
on
the
pillow
after
a
minute
if
the
sick
one
dies
will
it
go
to
heaven
yes
honey
i
think
the
boy
was
silent
for
a
time
thinking
was
easier
than
speech
his
mind
too
worked
slowly
it
was
after
a
pause
while
he
lay
there
with
closed
eyes
that
peter
saw
two
tears
slip
from
under
his
long
lashes
peter
bent
over
and
wiped
them
away
a
great
ache
in
his
heart
what
is
it
dear
i
afraid
it
going
to
die
would
that
be
so
terrible
jimmy
boy
asked
peter
gently
to
go
to
heaven
where
there
is
no
more
death
or
dying
where
it
is
always
summer
and
the
sun
always
shines
no
reply
for
a
moment
the
little
mouse
sat
up
on
the
pillow
and
rubbed
its
nose
with
a
pinkish
paw
the
baby
mice
in
the
cage
nuzzled
their
dead
mother
is
there
grass
yes
soft
green
do
boys
in
heaven
go
in
their
bare
feet
ah
small
mind
and
heart
so
terrified
and
yet
so
curious
indeed
and
there
on
his
knees
beside
the
white
bed
peter
painted
such
a
heaven
as
no
theologue
has
ever
had
the
humanity
to
paint
a
heaven
of
babbling
brooks
and
laughing
playing
children
a
heaven
of
dear
departed
puppies
and
resurrected
birds
of
friendly
deer
of
trees
in
fruit
of
speckled
fish
in
bright
rivers
painted
his
heaven
with
smiling
eyes
and
death
in
his
heart
a
child
heaven
of
games
and
friendly
indians
of
sunlight
and
rain
sweet
sleep
and
brisk
awakening
the
boy
listened
he
was
silent
when
peter
had
finished
speech
was
increasingly
an
effort
i
should
like
to
go
there
he
whispered
at
last
he
did
not
speak
again
during
all
the
long
afternoon
but
just
at
dusk
he
roused
again
i
would
like
to
see
the
sentry
he
said
with
difficulty
and
so
again
and
for
the
last
time
rosa
soldier
from
salzburg
with
one
lung
through
all
that
long
day
then
harmony
sat
over
her
work
unaccustomed
muscles
aching
the
whirring
machines
in
her
ears
monia
upset
over
the
morning
excitement
was
irritable
and
unreasonable
the
costume
had
come
back
from
le
grande
with
a
complaint
below
in
the
courtyard
all
day
curious
groups
stood
gaping
up
the
staircase
where
the
morning
had
seen
such
occurrences
at
the
noon
hour
while
the
girls
heated
soup
and
carried
in
pails
of
salad
from
the
corner
restaurant
harmony
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
playing
for
them
to
the
viennese
girls
this
was
the
hour
of
the
day
to
sit
back
soup
bowl
on
knee
the
machines
silent
monia
quarreling
in
the
kitchen
with
the
hungarian
servant
and
while
the
pigeons
ate
crusts
on
the
to
hear
this
american
girl
play
such
music
as
was
played
at
the
opera
her
slim
figure
swaying
her
whole
beautiful
face
and
body
glowing
with
the
melody
she
made
the
girls
found
the
situation
piquant
altogether
delightful
although
she
did
not
suspect
it
many
rumors
were
rife
about
harmony
in
the
workroom
she
was
not
of
the
people
they
said
the
daughter
of
a
great
american
of
course
run
away
to
escape
a
loveless
marriage
this
was
borne
out
by
the
report
of
one
of
them
who
had
glimpsed
the
silk
petticoat
it
was
rumored
also
that
she
wore
no
chemise
but
instead
an
infinitely
coquettish
series
of
lace
and
nainsook
garments
of
a
fineness
harmony
played
for
them
that
day
played
perhaps
as
she
had
not
played
since
the
day
she
had
moved
the
master
to
tears
played
to
peter
as
she
had
seen
him
at
the
window
to
jimmy
to
the
little
georgiev
as
he
went
down
the
staircase
and
finally
with
a
choke
in
her
throat
to
the
little
mother
back
home
so
hopeful
so
ignorant
in
the
evening
as
was
her
custom
she
took
the
one
real
meal
of
the
day
at
the
corner
restaurant
going
early
to
avoid
the
crowd
and
coming
back
quickly
through
the
winter
night
the
staircase
was
always
a
peril
to
be
encountered
and
conquered
night
after
night
and
even
in
the
daytime
not
to
be
lightly
regarded
on
her
way
up
this
night
she
heard
steps
ahead
heavy
measured
steps
that
climbed
steadily
without
pauses
for
an
instant
harmony
thought
it
sounded
like
peter
step
and
she
went
dizzy
but
it
was
not
peter
standing
in
the
upper
hall
much
as
he
had
stood
that
morning
over
the
ammunition
boxes
thumbs
in
heels
in
toes
out
chest
out
was
the
sentry
harmony
first
thought
was
of
georgiev
and
more
searching
of
the
building
then
she
saw
that
the
sentry
impassive
face
wore
lines
of
trouble
he
saluted
please
yes
i
have
not
told
the
herr
i
thank
but
the
child
jimmy
he
dies
all
of
last
night
and
it
is
perhaps
but
of
harmony
clutched
at
the
iron
for
support
you
are
sure
you
are
not
telling
me
so
that
i
will
go
back
he
dies
fraulein
the
herr
doktor
has
not
slept
for
many
hours
my
wife
rosa
sits
on
the
stair
to
see
that
none
disturb
and
her
cousin
the
wife
of
the
portier
weeps
over
the
stove
please
fraulein
come
with
when
did
you
leave
the
siebensternstrasse
but
and
he
still
lives
ja
fraulein
and
asks
for
now
suddenly
fell
away
from
the
girl
all
pride
all
fear
all
that
was
personal
and
small
and
frightened
before
the
reality
of
death
she
rose
as
women
by
divine
gift
do
rise
to
the
crisis
ceased
trembling
got
her
hat
and
coat
and
her
shabby
gloves
and
joined
the
sentry
again
another
moment
delay
to
secure
the
le
grande
address
from
monia
then
out
into
the
night
harmony
to
the
siebensternstrasse
the
tall
soldier
to
find
the
dancer
at
her
hotel
or
failing
that
at
the
ronacher
harmony
took
a
taxicab
nothing
must
be
spared
now
bribed
the
chauffeur
to
greater
speed
arrived
at
the
house
and
ran
across
the
garden
still
tearless
up
the
stairs
past
rosa
on
the
upper
flight
and
rang
the
bell
marie
admitted
her
with
only
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
there
was
nothing
to
warn
peter
one
moment
he
sat
by
the
bed
watch
in
hand
alone
drear
the
next
he
had
glanced
up
saw
harmony
and
went
white
holding
to
the
back
of
his
chair
their
eyes
met
agony
and
hope
in
them
love
and
death
rapture
and
bitterness
in
harmony
pleading
promise
something
of
doubt
in
peter
only
yearning
as
of
empty
arms
then
harmony
dared
to
look
at
the
bed
and
fell
on
her
knees
in
a
storm
of
grief
beside
it
peter
bent
over
and
gently
stroked
her
hair
le
grande
was
singing
the
boxes
were
full
in
the
body
of
the
immense
theater
waiters
scurried
back
and
forward
among
the
tables
everywhere
was
the
clatter
of
silver
and
steel
on
porcelain
the
clink
of
glasses
smoke
was
everywhere
pipes
cigars
cigarettes
women
smoked
between
bites
at
the
tables
using
small
paper
or
silver
mouthpieces
even
a
gold
one
shone
here
and
there
men
walked
up
and
down
among
the
diners
spraying
the
air
with
chemicals
to
clear
it
at
a
table
just
below
the
stage
sat
the
dozent
with
the
lady
of
the
photograph
they
were
drinking
cheap
native
wines
and
were
very
happy
from
the
height
of
his
worldly
wisdom
he
was
explaining
the
people
to
her
in
the
box
do
stare
liebchen
he
looks
is
the
princeling
i
have
told
you
of
roses
of
course
last
night
it
was
last
night
were
you
here
he
coughed
i
have
been
told
liebchen
each
night
he
sits
there
and
when
she
finishes
her
song
he
rises
in
the
box
kisses
the
flowers
and
tosses
them
to
shameless
is
she
so
beautiful
no
but
you
shall
see
she
le
grande
was
very
popular
she
occupied
the
best
place
on
the
program
and
because
she
sang
in
american
which
is
not
exactly
english
and
more
difficult
to
understand
her
songs
were
considered
exceedingly
risque
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
merely
ragtime
melodies
with
a
lilt
to
them
that
caught
the
viennese
fancy
accustomed
to
german
sentimental
ditties
and
the
artificial
forms
of
grand
opera
and
there
was
another
reason
for
her
success
she
carried
with
her
a
chorus
of
a
dozen
pickaninnies
in
austria
darkies
were
as
rare
as
cats
and
there
were
no
cats
so
the
little
chorus
had
made
good
each
day
she
walked
in
the
prater
ermine
from
head
to
foot
and
behind
her
two
by
two
trailed
twelve
little
southern
darkies
in
coats
and
caps
grinning
sociably
when
she
drove
a
pair
sat
on
the
boot
her
voice
was
strong
not
sweet
spoiled
by
years
of
singing
against
dishes
and
bottles
in
smoky
music
halls
spoiled
by
cigarettes
and
absinthe
and
foreign
cocktails
that
resembled
their
american
prototypes
as
the
night
resembles
the
day
she
wore
the
gold
dress
decolletee
slashed
to
the
knee
over
stockings
and
back
of
her
trailed
the
twelve
little
darkies
she
sang
dixie
of
course
and
the
old
folks
at
home
then
a
ragtime
medley
with
the
chorus
showing
rows
of
white
teeth
and
clogging
with
all
their
short
legs
le
grande
danced
to
that
a
whirling
nimble
dance
the
little
rhinestones
on
her
stockings
flashed
her
opulent
bosom
quivered
the
dozent
eyes
on
the
dancer
squeezed
his
hand
i
love
thee
he
whispered
rather
flushed
and
then
she
sang
doan
ye
cry
mah
her
voice
rather
coarse
but
melodious
lent
itself
to
the
negro
rhythm
the
swing
and
lilt
of
the
lullaby
the
little
darkies
eyes
rolling
preternaturally
solemn
linked
arms
and
swayed
rhythmically
right
left
right
left
the
glasses
ceased
clinking
sturdy
citizens
forgot
their
steak
and
beer
for
a
moment
and
listened
knife
and
fork
poised
under
the
table
the
dozent
hand
pressed
its
captive
affectionately
his
eyes
no
longer
on
le
grande
but
on
the
woman
across
his
sweetheart
she
who
would
be
mother
of
his
children
the
words
meant
little
to
the
audience
the
rich
rolling
southern
lullaby
held
them
rapt
doan

the
singer
swayed

cradled
she
picked
the
tiniest
darky
up
and
held
him
woolly
head
against
her
breast
and
crooned
to
him
rocking
on
her
jeweled
heels
the
crowd
applauded
the
man
in
the
box
kissed
his
flowers
and
flung
them
glasses
and
dishes
clinked
again
the
dozent
bent
across
the
table
some
day
he
said
the
girl
blushed
le
grande
made
her
way
into
the
wings
surrounded
by
her
little
troupe
a
motherly
colored
woman
took
them
shooed
them
off
rounded
them
up
like
a
flock
of
chickens
and
there
in
the
wings
grimly
impassive
stood
a
private
soldier
of
the
old
franz
josef
blocking
the
door
to
her
dressing
room
for
a
moment
gold
dress
and
dark
uniform
confronted
each
other
then
the
sentry
touched
his
cap
madam
he
said
the
child
is
in
the
riebensternstrasse
and
he
what
child
her
arms
were
full
of
flowers
the
child
from
the
hospital
please
to
make
jimmy
died
an
hour
after
midnight
quite
peacefully
died
with
one
hand
in
harmony
and
one
between
peter
two
big
ones
toward
the
last
he
called
peter
daddy
and
asked
for
a
drink
his
eyes
moving
slowly
round
the
room
passed
without
notice
the
grayfaced
woman
in
a
gold
dress
who
stood
staring
down
at
him
rested
a
moment
on
the
cage
of
mice
came
to
a
stop
in
the
doorway
where
stood
the
sentry
white
and
weary
but
refusing
rest
it
was
harmony
who
divined
the
child
unspoken
wish
the
manual
she
whispered
the
boy
nodded
and
so
just
inside
the
door
of
the
bedroom
across
from
the
old
salon
of
maria
theresa
the
sentry
with
sad
eyes
but
no
lack
of
vigor
went
again
through
the
austrian
manual
of
arms
and
because
he
had
no
carbine
he
used
peter
old
when
it
was
finished
the
boy
smiled
faintly
tried
to
salute
lay
still
chapter
xxvii
peter
was
going
back
to
america
and
still
he
had
not
told
harmony
he
loved
her
it
was
necessary
that
he
go
back
his
money
had
about
given
out
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
more
save
by
earning
it
the
drain
of
jimmy
illness
the
inevitable
expense
of
the
small
grave
and
the
tiny
stone
peter
had
insisted
on
buying
had
made
retreat
his
only
course
true
le
grande
had
wished
to
defray
all
expenses
but
peter
was
inexorable
no
money
earned
as
the
dancer
earned
hers
should
purchase
peaceful
rest
for
the
loved
little
body
and
after
seeing
peter
eyes
the
dancer
had
not
insisted
a
week
had
seen
many
changes
marie
was
gone
after
a
conference
between
stewart
and
peter
that
had
been
decided
on
stewart
raised
the
money
somehow
and
peter
saw
her
off
palpitant
and
eager
with
the
pin
he
had
sent
her
to
semmering
at
her
throat
she
kissed
peter
on
the
cheek
in
the
station
rather
to
his
embarrassment
from
the
lowered
window
as
the
train
pulled
out
she
waved
a
moist
handkerchief
i
shall
be
very
good
she
promised
him
the
last
words
he
heard
above
the
grinding
of
the
train
were
her
cheery
to
america
peter
was
living
alone
in
the
street
of
seven
stars
getting
food
where
he
might
happen
to
be
buying
a
little
now
and
then
from
the
delicatessen
shop
across
the
street
for
harmony
had
gone
back
to
the
house
in
the
wollbadgasse
she
had
stayed
until
all
was
over
and
until
marie
small
preparations
for
departure
were
over
then
while
peter
was
at
the
station
she
slipped
away
again
but
this
time
she
left
her
address
she
wrote
you
will
come
to
visit
me
dear
peter
because
i
was
so
lonely
before
and
that
is
unnecessary
now
but
you
must
know
that
i
can
not
stay
in
the
siebensternstrasse
we
have
each
our
own
fight
to
make
and
you
have
been
trying
to
fight
for
us
all
for
marie
for
dear
little
jimmy
for
me
you
must
get
back
to
work
now
you
have
lost
so
much
time
and
i
am
managing
well
the
frau
professor
is
back
and
will
take
an
evening
lesson
and
soon
i
shall
have
more
money
from
fraulein
reiff
you
can
see
how
things
are
looking
up
for
me
in
a
few
months
i
shall
be
able
to
renew
my
music
lessons
and
then
peter
the
career
her
address
was
beneath
peter
had
suffered
much
he
was
thinner
grayer
and
as
he
stood
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
felt
that
harmony
was
right
he
could
offer
her
nothing
but
his
shabby
self
his
problematic
future
perhaps
surely
everything
would
have
been
settled
without
reason
had
he
only
once
taken
the
girl
in
his
arms
told
her
she
was
the
breath
of
life
itself
to
him
but
adversity
while
it
had
roused
his
fighting
spirit
in
everything
else
had
sapped
his
confidence
he
had
found
the
letter
on
his
and
he
found
himself
confronting
his
image
over
it
a
tall
stooping
figure
a
tired
lined
face
a
coat
that
bore
the
impress
of
many
days
with
a
sick
child
head
against
its
breast
so
it
was
over
she
had
come
back
and
gone
again
and
this
time
he
must
let
her
go
who
was
he
to
detain
her
she
would
carry
herself
on
to
success
he
felt
she
had
youth
hope
beauty
and
ability
and
she
had
proved
the
thing
he
had
not
dared
to
believe
that
she
could
take
care
of
herself
in
the
old
city
only
to
go
away
and
leave
her
there
mclean
would
remain
no
doubt
he
already
had
harmony
address
in
the
wollbadgasse
peter
was
not
subtle
no
psychologist
but
he
had
seen
during
the
last
few
days
how
the
boy
watched
harmony
every
word
every
gesture
and
perhaps
when
loneliness
and
hard
work
began
to
tell
on
her
mclean
devotion
would
win
its
reward
mclean
devotion
with
all
that
it
meant
the
lessons
again
community
of
taste
their
common
youth
peter
felt
old
very
tired
nevertheless
he
went
that
night
to
the
wollbadgasse
he
sent
his
gray
suit
to
the
portier
wife
to
be
pressed
and
getting
out
his
surgical
case
as
he
had
once
before
in
the
pension
schwarz
he
sewed
a
button
on
his
overcoat
using
the
curved
needle
and
the
catgut
and
working
with
surgeon
precision
then
still
working
very
carefully
he
trimmed
the
edges
of
graying
hair
over
his
ears
trimmed
his
cuffs
trimmed
his
best
silk
tie
now
almost
hopeless
he
blacked
his
shoes
and
the
suit
not
coming
he
donned
his
and
went
into
jimmy
room
to
feed
the
mice
peter
stood
a
moment
beside
the
smooth
white
bed
with
his
face
working
the
wooden
sentry
still
stood
on
the
bedside
table
it
was
in
peter
mind
to
take
the
mice
to
harmony
confess
his
defeat
and
approaching
retreat
and
ask
her
to
care
for
them
then
he
decided
against
this
palpable
appeal
for
sympathy
elected
to
go
and
discover
merely
how
comfortable
she
was
or
was
not
when
the
time
came
he
would
slip
out
of
her
life
sending
her
a
letter
and
leaving
mclean
on
guard
harmony
was
at
home
peter
climbed
the
dark
staircase
where
harmony
had
met
the
little
georgiev
and
where
he
had
gone
down
to
his
death
climbed
steadily
but
without
his
usual
elasticity
the
place
appalled
him
its
gloom
its
dinginess
its
somber
quiet
in
the
daylight
with
the
pigeons
on
the
sills
and
the
morning
sunlight
printing
the
cross
of
the
church
steeple
on
the
whitewashed
wall
it
was
peaceful
cloisterlike
with
landings
that
were
crypts
but
at
night
it
was
almost
terrifying
that
staircase
harmony
was
playing
peter
heard
her
when
he
reached
the
upper
landing
playing
a
sad
little
strain
that
gripped
his
heart
he
waited
outside
before
ringing
heard
her
begin
something
determinedly
cheerful
falter
cease
altogether
peter
rang
harmony
herself
admitted
him
perhaps
oh
certainly
she
had
expected
him
it
would
be
peter
of
course
to
come
and
see
how
she
was
getting
on
how
she
was
housed
she
held
out
her
hand
and
peter
took
it
still
no
words
only
a
half
smile
from
her
and
no
smile
at
all
from
peter
but
his
heart
in
his
eyes
i
hoped
you
would
come
peter
we
may
have
the
reception
you
knew
i
would
come
said
peter
the
reception
room
where
customers
she
still
carried
her
violin
and
slipped
back
to
her
room
to
put
it
away
peter
had
a
glimpse
of
its
poverty
and
its
meagerness
he
drew
a
long
breath
monia
was
at
the
opera
and
the
hungarian
sat
in
the
kitchen
knitting
a
stocking
the
reception
room
was
warm
from
the
day
fire
and
in
order
all
the
pins
and
scraps
of
the
day
had
been
swept
up
and
the
portieres
that
made
of
the
corners
were
pushed
back
peter
saw
only
a
big
room
with
empty
corners
and
that
at
a
glance
his
eyes
were
harmony
he
sat
down
awkwardly
on
a
stiff
chair
harmony
on
a
velvet
settee
they
were
suddenly
two
strangers
meeting
for
the
first
time
in
the
squalor
of
the
pension
schwarz
in
the
comfortable
intimacies
of
the
street
of
seven
stars
they
had
been
easy
unconstrained
now
suddenly
peter
was
only
one
thing
in
him
clamored
for
utterance
and
that
he
sternly
silenced
i
i
could
not
stay
there
peter
you
understood
no
of
course
i
you
were
not
angry
why
should
i
be
angry
you
came
like
an
angel
of
light
when
i
needed
you
only
of
course
yes
i
not
say
that
i
please
say
it
peter
peter
writhed
looked
everywhere
but
at
her
please
peter
you
said
i
always
came
when
you
needed
me
only
only
i
always
need
you
peter
peter
not
always
i
think
of
course
when
one
is
in
trouble
one
needs
a
woman
but
well
of
course
but
i
generally
in
trouble
harry
frightfully
ashamed
of
himself
by
that
time
was
peter
ashamed
of
his
weakness
he
sought
to
give
a
casual
air
to
the
speech
by
stooping
for
a
neglected
pin
on
the
carpet
by
the
time
he
had
stuck
it
in
his
lapel
he
had
saved
his
mental
forces
from
the
rout
of
harmony
eyes
his
next
speech
he
made
to
the
center
table
and
missed
a
most
delectable
look
in
the
aforesaid
eyes
i
did
come
to
be
silly
he
said
to
the
table
i
hate
people
who
whine
and
i
got
into
a
damnable
habit
of
being
sorry
for
myself
it
to
laugh
is
it
a
great
hulking
carcass
like
me
to
be
peter
said
harmony
softly
are
you
going
to
look
at
me
i
that
cowardice
and
i
fixed
my
hair
a
new
way
do
you
like
it
splendid
said
peter
to
the
center
table
you
did
look
the
rout
of
harmony
eyes
was
supplemented
by
the
rout
of
hair
peter
goaded
got
up
and
walked
about
harmony
was
half
exasperated
she
would
have
boxed
peter
ears
with
a
tender
hand
had
she
dared
his
hands
thrust
savagely
in
his
pockets
peter
turned
and
faced
her
at
last
first
of
all
he
said
i
am
going
back
to
america
harmony
got
all
i
can
get
here
all
i
came
for
he
stopped
seeing
her
face
well
of
course
that
not
true
i
have
but
i
going
back
anyhow
you
need
look
so
stricken
i
have
lost
my
chance
come
back
sometime
again
and
finish
when
i
earned
enough
to
do
you
will
never
come
back
peter
you
have
spent
all
your
money
on
others
and
now
you
are
going
back
just
where
you
were
and
you
are
leaving
me
here
alone
you
are
alone
anyhow
said
peter
making
your
own
way
and
getting
along
and
mclean
will
be
are
you
turning
me
over
to
him
no
reply
peter
was
pacing
the
floor
peter
yes
dear
do
you
remember
the
night
in
anna
room
at
the
schwartz
when
you
proposed
to
me
no
reply
peter
found
another
pin
and
that
night
in
the
old
lodge
when
you
proposed
to
me
again
peter
turned
and
looked
at
her
at
her
slender
swaying
young
figure
her
luminous
eyes
her
parted
childish
lips
peter
i
want
you
to
to
ask
me
no
why
now
listen
to
me
harmony
you
sorry
for
me
that
all
i
want
to
be
pitied
you
stay
here
and
work
you
do
big
things
i
had
a
talk
with
the
master
while
i
was
searching
for
you
and
he
says
you
can
do
anything
but
he
looked
at
me
and
a
sight
i
was
with
worry
and
fright
and
he
warned
me
off
harmony
he
says
you
must
not
old
pig
said
harmony
i
will
marry
if
i
nevertheless
peter
refusal
and
the
master
speech
had
told
somewhat
she
was
colder
less
vibrant
peter
came
to
her
stood
close
looking
down
at
her
i
said
a
lot
i
did
mean
to
he
said
there
only
one
thing
i
have
said
i
ought
to
say
it
dear
i
not
going
to
marry
you
i
wo
have
such
a
thing
on
my
conscience
but
it
does
hurt
a
woman
to
know
that
a
man
loves
her
i
love
you
dear
you
my
heaven
and
my
earth
even
my
god
i
afraid
but
i
will
not
marry
not
even
if
i
ask
you
to
not
even
then
dear
to
share
my
struggle
i
see
slowly
it
is
to
be
a
struggle
a
hard
fight
harmony
i
a
pauper
and
what
am
i
two
poverties
do
make
a
wealth
even
of
happiness
said
peter
steadily
in
the
time
to
come
when
you
would
think
of
what
you
might
have
been
it
would
be
a
thousand
deaths
to
me
people
have
married
women
have
married
and
carried
on
their
work
too
not
your
sort
of
women
or
your
sort
of
work
and
not
my
sort
of
man
harry
i
jealous
jealous
of
every
one
about
you
it
would
have
to
be
the
music
or
and
you
make
the
choice
said
harmony
proudly
very
well
peter
i
shall
do
as
you
say
but
i
think
it
is
a
very
curious
sort
of
i
wonder
peter
cried
if
you
realize
what
love
it
is
that
loves
you
enough
to
give
you
you
have
not
asked
me
if
i
care
peter
looked
at
her
she
was
very
near
to
tears
very
sad
very
beautiful
i
afraid
to
ask
said
peter
and
picking
up
his
hat
he
made
for
the
door
there
he
turned
looked
back
was
lost
my
sweetest
heart
he
cried
and
took
her
in
his
hungry
arms
but
even
then
with
her
arms
about
his
neck
at
last
with
her
slender
body
held
to
him
her
head
on
his
shoulder
his
lips
to
her
soft
throat
peter
put
her
from
him
as
a
starving
man
might
put
away
food
he
held
her
off
and
looked
at
her
i
a
fool
and
a
weakling
he
said
gravely
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
would
sacrifice
you
you
are
very
lovely
my
girl
my
girl
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
carry
your
image
in
my
ah
what
the
little
georgiev
had
said
on
his
way
to
the
death
that
waited
down
the
staircase
peter
not
daring
to
look
at
her
again
put
away
her
detaining
hand
squared
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
harmony
he
said
steadily
always
in
my
heart
very
near
the
end
now
the
little
marie
on
the
way
to
america
with
the
recording
angel
opening
a
new
page
in
life
ledger
for
her
and
a
line
erasing
the
other
with
jimmy
and
his
daddy
wandering
through
the
heaven
of
friendly
adventure
and
green
fields
hand
in
hand
with
the
carrier
resting
after
its
labors
in
the
pigeon
house
by
the
of
sofia
with
the
sentry
casting
martial
shadows
through
the
barred
windows
of
the
hospital
and
the
little
georgiev
about
to
die
dividing
his
heart
as
a
heritage
between
his
country
and
a
young
girl
very
near
the
end
with
the
morning
light
of
the
next
day
shining
into
the
salon
of
maria
theresa
and
on
to
peter
open
trunk
and
shabby
wardrobe
spread
over
chairs
an
end
of
trunks
and
departure
as
was
the
beginning
early
morning
at
the
gottesacker
or
god
acre
whence
little
jimmy
had
started
on
his
comfortable
journey
early
morning
on
the
grass
the
frozen
roads
the
snap
and
sparkle
of
the
donau
harmony
had
taken
her
problem
there
in
the
early
hour
before
monia
would
summon
her
to
labor
took
her
problem
and
found
her
answer
the
great
cemetery
was
still
and
deserted
harmony
none
too
warmly
clad
walked
briskly
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
oiled
paper
against
the
cold
already
the
air
carried
a
hint
of
spring
there
was
a
feeling
of
resurrection
and
promise
the
dead
earth
felt
alive
harmony
knelt
by
the
grave
and
said
the
little
prayer
the
child
had
repeated
at
night
and
morning
and
because
he
had
loved
it
with
some
vague
feeling
of
giving
him
comfort
she
recited
the
little
verse
ah
well
for
us
all
some
sweet
hope
lies
deeply
buried
from
human
eyes
and
in
the
hereafter
angels
may
roll
the
stone
from
its
grave
when
she
looked
up
le
grande
was
standing
beside
her
there
was
no
scene
hardly
any
tears
she
had
brought
out
a
great
bunch
of
roses
that
bore
only
too
clearly
the
stamp
of
whence
they
came
one
of
the
pickaninnies
had
carried
the
box
and
stood
impassively
by
gazing
at
harmony
le
grande
placed
her
flowers
on
the
grave
they
almost
covered
it
quite
eclipsed
harmony
i
come
here
every
morning
she
said
simply
she
had
a
cab
waiting
and
offered
to
drive
harmony
back
to
the
city
her
quiet
almost
irritated
harmony
until
she
had
looked
once
into
the
woman
eyes
after
that
she
knew
it
was
on
the
drive
back
with
the
little
darky
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
that
harmony
got
her
answer
le
grande
put
a
hand
over
harmony
i
tried
to
tell
you
before
how
good
i
know
you
were
to
we
loved
and
i
resented
it
but
byrne
was
right
i
was
not
a
fit
person
to
to
have
it
was
not
that
not
only
that
did
he
ever
ask
for
me
but
of
course
no
he
had
no
silence
for
a
moment
the
loose
windows
of
the
cab
clattered
i
loved
him
very
much
when
he
came
said
le
grande
although
i
did
not
want
him
i
had
been
told
i
could
have
a
career
on
the
stage
ah
my
dear
i
chose
the
career
and
look
at
me
what
have
i
a
grave
in
the
cemetery
back
there
and
on
it
roses
sent
me
by
a
man
i
loathe
if
i
could
live
it
over
again
the
answer
was
very
close
now
would
you
stay
at
home
who
knows
i
being
i
and
my
husband
did
not
love
me
it
was
the
boy
always
there
is
only
one
thing
worth
while
the
love
of
a
good
man
i
have
lived
lived
hard
and
i
but
supposing
that
one
has
real
ability
i
mean
some
achievement
already
and
a
promise
le
grande
turned
and
looked
at
harmony
shrewdly
i
see
you
are
a
musician
i
believe
and
it
is
byrne
le
grande
bent
forward
earnestly
my
child
she
said
if
one
man
in
all
the
world
looked
at
me
as
your
doctor
looks
at
you
i
i
would
be
a
better
and
my
music
play
for
your
children
as
you
played
for
my
little
peter
was
packing
wrapping
medical
books
in
old
coats
putting
clean
collars
next
to
boots
folding
pajamas
and
negligible
garments
with
great
care
and
putting
in
his
dresscoat
in
a
roll
his
pipes
took
time
and
the
wooden
sentry
he
packed
with
great
care
and
a
bit
of
healthy
emotion
once
or
twice
he
came
across
trifles
of
harmony
and
he
put
them
carefully
aside
the
sweater
coat
a
folded
handkerchief
a
bow
she
had
worn
at
her
throat
the
bow
brought
back
the
night
before
and
that
reckless
kiss
on
her
white
throat
well
for
peter
to
get
away
if
he
is
to
keep
his
resolution
when
the
sight
of
a
ribbon
bow
can
bring
that
look
of
suffering
into
his
eyes
the
portier
below
was
polishing
floors
right
foot
left
foot
any
foot
at
all
and
as
he
polished
he
sang
in
a
throaty
tenor
kennst
du
das
land
wo
die
citronen
bluhen
he
sang
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
coughed
a
bit
of
floor
wax
having
got
into
the
air
the
antlers
of
the
deer
from
the
shop
hung
now
in
his
bedroom
when
the
wildgame
seller
came
over
for
coffee
there
would
be
a
discussion
probably
but
were
not
the
antlers
of
all
deer
similar
the
portier
wife
came
to
the
doorway
with
a
cooking
fork
in
her
hand
a
cab
she
announced
with
a
devil
imp
on
the
box
perhaps
it
is
that
american
dancer
run
and
pretty
thyself
it
was
too
late
for
more
than
an
upward
twist
of
a
mustache
harmony
was
at
the
door
but
not
the
harmony
of
a
week
before
or
the
undecided
and
troubled
girl
of
before
that
a
radiant
harmony
this
who
stood
in
the
doorway
who
wished
them
and
ran
up
the
old
staircase
with
glowing
eyes
and
a
heart
that
leaped
and
throbbed
a
woman
now
this
harmony
one
who
had
looked
on
life
and
learned
one
who
had
chosen
her
fate
and
was
running
to
meet
it
one
who
feared
only
death
not
life
or
anything
that
life
could
offer
the
door
was
not
locked
perhaps
peter
was
not
up
not
dressed
what
did
that
matter
what
did
anything
matter
but
peter
himself
peter
sorting
out
lectures
on
mcburney
point
had
come
across
a
bit
of
paper
that
did
not
belong
there
and
was
sitting
by
his
open
trunk
staring
blindly
at
it
you
are
very
kind
to
me
yes
indeed
h
quite
the
end
now
with
harmony
running
across
the
room
and
dropping
down
on
her
knees
among
a
riot
of
garments
down
on
her
knees
with
one
arm
round
peter
neck
drawing
his
tired
head
lower
until
she
could
kiss
him
oh
peter
peter
dear
she
cried
i
love
you
all
my
life
if
only
you
love
me
and
never
never
let
me
go
peter
was
dazed
at
first
he
put
his
arms
about
her
rather
unsteadily
because
he
had
given
her
up
and
had
expected
to
go
through
the
rest
of
life
empty
of
arm
and
heart
and
when
one
has
one
arms
set
as
one
may
say
for
loneliness
and
relinquishment
it
is
rather
difficult
ah
but
peter
got
the
way
of
it
swiftly
always
he
said
incoherently
forever
the
two
of
us
whatever
comes
harmony
whatever
and
you
not
be
sorry
not
if
you
love
peter
kissed
her
on
the
eyes
very
solemnly
god
helping
me
i
be
good
to
you
always
and
i
always
love
he
tried
to
hold
her
away
from
him
for
a
moment
after
that
to
tell
her
what
she
was
doing
what
she
was
giving
up
she
would
not
be
reasoned
with
i
love
you
was
her
answer
to
every
line
and
it
was
no
divided
allegiance
she
promised
him
career
i
shall
have
a
career
yours
and
your
music
she
colored
held
him
closer
some
day
she
whispered
i
shall
tell
you
about
late
winter
morning
in
vienna
with
the
hurrying
home
the
alserstrasse
alive
with
humanity
soldiers
and
housewives
and
beggars
before
the
hospital
the
crowd
lines
up
along
the
curb
the
head
waiter
from
the
across
comes
to
the
doorway
and
looks
out
the
sentry
in
front
of
the
hospital
ceases
pacing
and
stands
at
attention
in
the
street
a
small
procession
comes
at
the
double
quick
a
handful
of
troopers
a
black
van
with
tiny
windows
more
troopers
inside
the
van
a
bulgarian
spy
going
out
to
death
a
swarthy
little
man
with
black
eyes
and
short
thick
hands
going
out
like
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
to
meet
the
god
of
patriots
and
lovers
the
sentry
who
was
only
a
soldier
from
salzburg
with
one
lung
was
also
a
gentleman
and
a
patriot
he
uncovered
his
head
