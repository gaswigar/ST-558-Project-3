notice
by

coincidence
on

married
mary
elizabeth
eden
to
william
asbury
thompson
the
bride
is
the
daughter
of
colonel
and
eden
of
edenton
the
groom
is
the
son
of
the
late
reverend
and
asbury
thompson
and
is
serving
his
first
year
in
the
itinerancy
on
the
redwine
circuit
we
wish
the
young
people
happiness
and
success
in
their
chosen
field
chosen
field
had
reference
to
the
itinerancy
not
matrimony
and
that
was
my
obituary
if
i
had
only
known
it
for
after
that
if
i
was
not
dead
to
the
world
i
only
saw
it
through
the
keyhole
of
the
methodist
discipline
or
lifted
and
transfigured
by
sermons
a
straight
and
narrow
path
that
led
from
the
church
door
to
the
grave
but
now
after
an
absence
of
thirty
years
i
am
addressing
this
series
of
letters
to
the
people
of
the
world
concerning
life
and
conditions
in
another
removed
from
this
one
by
the
length
of
long
country
roads
by
the
thickness
of
church
doors
and
by
the
plate
glass
surface
of
the
religious
mind
they
will
record
some
experiences
of
two
methodist
itinerants
and
whatever
i
think
besides
for
they
are
written
more
particularly
to
relieve
my
mind
of
a
very
great
burden
of
opinions
for
william
has
been
promoted
he
has
received
his
ll
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
by
this
time
if
there
are
any
degrees
or
giving
of
degrees
there
along
with
moses
and
elijah
and
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
more
respected
saint
in
that
great
company
we
buried
him
a
year
ago
in
the
graveyard
behind
redwine
church
i
was
born
in
edenton
a
little
town
in
middle
georgia
and
my
name
was
recorded
in
the
third
generation
of
edens
on
the
baptismal
registry
of
john
church
there
william
was
born
somewhere
in
a
methodist
parsonage
and
his
name
is
probably
written
on
the
first
page
of
the
oldest
predestination
volume
in
heaven
in
edenton
the
best
families
attended
the
episcopal
church
it
was
a
john
of
course
though
why
this
denomination
should
be
so
partial
to
that
apostle
is
a
mystery
for
his
autobiography
as
recorded
in
the
new
testament
reads
more
like
that
of
a
campmeeting
methodist
than
any
other
disciple
as
a
child
its
presence
there
at
the
end
of
the
shaded
village
street
was
real
to
me
like
my
mother
i
did
not
repent
in
it
as
one
must
do
in
a
methodist
or
baptist
church
but
i
grew
up
in
it
like
a
daughter
in
the
house
of
the
lord
as
a
girl
on
sabbath
mornings
i
entered
it
with
all
the
mincing
worldliness
of
my
young
mind
unabashed
later
i
was
confirmed
in
it
and
experienced
some
of
the
vanity
of
that
high
spiritual
calm
which
attends
quick
conversions
in
other
churches
and
to
this
day
there
is
something
ineffably
sweet
and
whimsically
inconsistent
to
me
in
an
episcopal
saint
the
fastidious
stamina
of
their
spirituality
which
never
interferes
with
their
worldliness
is
so
satisfyingly
human
piety
renders
them
increasingly
graceful
in
manners
and
appearance
in
heaven
i
believe
episcopalian
saints
will
be
distinguished
from
all
others
by
stiff
ruffs
worn
around
their
redeemed
necks
but
all
was
different
in
the
church
to
which
william
belonged
and
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
for
three
generations
the
best
families
are
never
in
the
majority
there
you
will
find
instead
besides
a
few
prominent
members
the
poor
the
the
morally
who
have
always
flocked
to
the
methodist
fold
for
this
pitying
reason
because
they
find
that
if
fallen
it
is
easier
to
rise
in
grace
according
to
the
doctrines
of
that
church
so
while
william
father
and
further
fathers
had
been
engaged
in
the
tedious
mercy
of
healing
and
rehealing
these
lame
indigent
souls
according
to
various
hallelujah
plans
my
mother
and
foremothers
had
been
engaged
in
embroidering
and
in
making
durable
dorcas
aprons
for
the
unknown
poor
this
made
the
difference
in
our
natures
that
love
bridged
that
is
the
wonderful
thing
about
love
it
comes
so
tremendously
new
and
directly
from
god
to
recreate
in
us
and
it
is
so
divinely
unprejudiced
by
what
our
ancestors
did
religiously
or
sacrilegiously
to
all
appearances
it
would
have
been
better
for
william
if
he
had
chosen
for
his
wife
one
of
those
pallid
virgins
who
so
naturally
keep
their
lamps
trimmed
and
burning
before
the
pulpits
of
unmarried
preachers
they
are
really
the
best
women
to
be
found
in
any
church
they
never
go
astray
they
are
the
gentle
maiden
sisters
of
all
souls
the
faded
feminine
of
a
benighted
ministry
who
wither
and
grow
old
without
ever
suspecting
that
their
hope
was
marriage
no
less
than
it
is
the
hope
of
the
giddiest
girl
however
a
preacher
rarely
takes
one
of
them
for
his
first
wife
it
is
only
after
he
has
been
left
a
widower
with
a
house
full
of
children
that
he
turns
imploring
in
their
direction
and
whatever
is
true
in
other
churches
it
will
be
found
upon
investigation
that
most
of
the
excellent
stepmothers
so
numerous
in
the
methodist
itinerancy
have
been
selected
from
this
class
but
william
was
not
a
widower
besides
love
is
the
leveler
of
human
judgments
in
such
matters
and
the
builder
of
new
destinies
so
i
was
chosen
instead
of
the
virgin
to
be
his
wife
the
gayest
wildest
young
heroine
hoyden
in
the
town
we
met
by
chance
in
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
i
remember
the
day
very
well
so
blue
above
so
green
below
with
all
the
roses
in
edenton
blooming
i
was
going
to
tea
at
the
mallarys
i
wore
a
green
muslin
very
tight
in
the
waist
but
flaring
in
the
skirt
like
the
spring
boughs
of
a
young
bay
tree
i
had
corntassel
hair
and
a
complexion
that
gave
my
heart
away
mallary
a
soft
young
matron
met
me
at
the
door
and
whispered
that
she
had
a
surprise
for
me
the
next
moment
we
entered
the
parlor
together
the
room
spun
around
i
heard
her
introducing
some
one
felt
the
red
betrayal
on
my
brow
and
found
myself
gazing
into
the
face
of
a
strange
young
man
and
hoping
that
he
would
ask
me
to
marry
him
it
was
william
a
college
mate
of
tom
mallary
spending
the
night
on
his
way
to
his
circuit
from
a
district
meeting
he
wore
his
preacher
clothes
and
looked
like
a
young
in
mourning
as
he
bowed
and
replied
to
me
with
his
eyes
that
indeed
he
would
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
as
soon
as
it
was
proper
to
do
so
this
was
sooner
than
any
steward
or
missions
mother
in
his
church
would
have
suspected
for
once
a
man
is
in
love
his
sense
of
propriety
becomes
naïvely
obtuse
and
primitive
there
is
little
distinction
between
a
preacher
and
any
other
man
as
a
lover
william
i
recall
made
love
as
ardently
as
the
wildest
young
scamp
in
edenton
this
was
one
of
the
thrilling
circumstances
of
our
courtship
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
tom
logan
or
arthur
flemming
or
any
one
of
a
half
a
dozen
others
had
made
me
telegraphic
dispatches
of
an
adoring
nature
with
his
eyes
but
i
was
flattered
and
delighted
to
have
melted
the
mortal
man
in
a
young
minister
who
always
looked
as
if
he
had
just
risen
from
his
knees
i
do
not
know
why
women
are
this
way
about
preachers
but
they
are
at
least
they
were
in
my
day
and
later
i
discovered
that
the
trait
leads
to
curious
complications
meanwhile
i
left
the
course
of
our
true
love
all
to
william
feeling
that
a
man
who
could
smile
like
that
must
know
what
was
proper
we
were
engaged
in
less
than
a
week
and
married
in
a
month
women
only
are
the
conductors
of
protracted
courtships
our
wedding
tour
was
a
drive
of
twenty
miles
through
the
country
to
the
parsonage
on
the
redwine
circuit
and
the
only
one
who
had
any
moral
impression
of
the
day
was
the
horse
i
do
not
even
recall
the
road
except
that
it
swept
away
like
a
white
scarf
over
the
green
world
and
that
wild
roses
looked
at
me
intimately
from
the
fence
corners
as
we
passed
william
had
a
happy
amen
expression
but
neither
of
us
was
thinking
of
the
living
or
dying
souls
in
the
redwine
circuit
the
horse
however
had
got
her
training
on
the
road
between
churches
and
did
not
know
she
was
conducting
a
wedding
tour
she
was
a
sorrel
very
thin
and
with
the
disposition
of
a
conscientious
woman
she
was
concerned
only
to
get
us
to
the
parsonage
in
time
for
the
surprise
that
had
been
secretly
prepared
for
our
coming
toward
evening
the
road
narrowed
and
steepened
and
looking
up
we
caught
sight
of
it
a
little
wren
of
a
house
hidden
between
two
green
shoulders
of
the
world
the
roof
sloped
until
one
could
touch
the
mossy
shingles
and
the
chimneys
on
either
side
were
like
ugly
voluminous
old
women
who
rocked
the
cradle
of
a
home
between
them
and
cheered
it
with
the
red
heart
of
wood
fires
within
in
the
valley
below
lived
the
people
of
redwine
church
but
the
world
was
withdrawn
and
could
only
be
seen
at
a
great
distance
through
the
gateway
of
the
two
hills
one
had
the
feeling
that
god
ancient
peace
had
not
been
disturbed
in
this
place
and
this
was
a
solemn
foreboding
feeling
for
me
as
we
reached
the
shadow
of
the
big
fruit
tree
in
front
of
the
house
and
william
lifted
me
lightly
from
the
buggy
unlatched
the
door
it
was
before
the
day
of
rogues
and
locks
in
that
community
and
welcomed
me
home
with
a
kiss
that
felt
a
trifle
too
much
like
a
benediction
there
were
two
rooms
one
was
a
bedroom
having
a
red
white
and
blue
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
and
furnished
with
a
bed
a
little
rocking
chair
a
very
straight
larger
chair
and
a
mirror
hanging
over
a
table
that
was
covered
with
fancifully
notched
blue
paper
the
other
was
the
living
room
and
contained
a
cedar
piggin
and
gourd
on
a
shelf
a
bread
tray
dishpan
a
pot
and
two
skillets
on
another
shelf
near
the
fireplace
two
chairs
a
table
and
a
cat
the
cat
was
a
large
gray
agnostic
he
never
admitted
william
presence
by
so
much
as
a
purr
or
a
claw
and
i
have
noticed
that
the
agnostic
is
the
only
creature
living
who
can
treat
a
preacher
with
so
much
contempt
we
found
him
curled
up
on
the
window
sill
next
to
the
milk
pitcher
sunning
himself
william
went
out
to
put
up
his
horse
and
i
drew
a
chair
before
the
shelf
containing
the
bread
tray
the
dishpan
pot
and
skillets
and
stared
at
them
with
horror
and
amazement
why
had
william
not
mentioned
this
matter
of
cooking
i
had
never
cooked
anything
but
cakes
and
icings
in
my
whole
life
i
was
preparing
to
weep
when
a
knock
sounded
upon
the
door
and
immediately
a
large
fair
woman
entered
she
wore
the
most
extraordinary
teacup
bonnet
on
her
huge
head
that
was
tied
somewhere
in
the
creases
of
her
doubled
chin
with
black
ribbons
and
on
a
blue
plate
she
was
carrying
a
stack
of
pies
nearly
a
foot
high
catching
sight
of
the
tears
in
my
eyes
as
i
arose
to
meet
her
she
set
the
pies
down
clasped
me
in
her
arms
and
whispered
with
motherly
tenderness
i
know
how
you
feel
child
it
the
way
all
brides
feel
when
they
first
realize
what
they
have
done
and
all
they
done
to
theirselves
but
so
bad
you
come
down
to
it
in
less
a
week
and
you
must
cry
now
with
all
the
folks
comin
in
they
wo
understand
she
pointed
through
the
open
door
and
i
turned
in
the
shelter
of
her
arms
to
see
down
the
road
a
strand
of
people
ascending
the
hill
dressed
like
fancy
beads
each
behind
the
other
and
each
bearing
something
in
her
hands
or
on
his
shoulders
and
william
standing
at
the
gate
to
welcome
them
who
are
they
i
asked
in
astonishment
it
a
donation
party
i
come
on
ahead
to
warn
you
them
the
members
of
the
redwine
fellowship
and
macedonia
churches
things
to
celebrate
your
weddin
i
glory
white
wife
of
one
of
the
stewards
at
redwine
and
we
air
powerful
glad
to
have
you
so
you
must
cry
till
the
folk
air
all
gone
or
they
think
you
satisfied
which
wo
do
your
husband
any
good
that
was
my
first
lesson
in
suppressing
my
natural
feelings
as
the
years
went
by
i
had
more
lessons
in
it
than
in
anything
else
and
i
reckon
it
is
not
such
a
bad
thing
to
do
for
if
one
natural
feelings
are
suppressed
long
enough
one
develops
supernatural
feelings
and
feels
surer
of
having
a
soul
the
donation
party
poured
in
sister
glory
white
and
i
standing
between
the
kitchen
table
and
the
fireplace
to
receive
them
william
acted
as
master
of
ceremonies
conducting
each
man
and
woman
forward
with
great
for
the
introduction
everyone
called
me
sister
thompson
and
laid
a
donation
on
the
table
in
passing
i
was
not
aware
at
the
time
of
their
importance
but
as
william
only
received
two
hundred
and
dollars
for
his
salary
that
year
we
should
have
starved
but
for
an
occasional
donation
party
in
fact
they
are
smiling
providential
instances
in
the
memory
of
every
methodist
itinerant
upon
this
occasion
they
ranged
from
bedquilts
to
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
from
jam
and
watermelon
rind
preserves
to
flour
meal
and
chair
tidies
one
old
lady
brought
a
package
of
simmons
liver
regulator
and
brother
billy
fleming
contributed
a
long
twist
of
dog
shank
a
homecured
tobacco
the
older
women
spread
the
viands
for
the
infare
as
the
wedding
dinner
was
called
upon
the
table
and
we
stood
about
it
to
eat
amid
shouts
and
laughter
and
an
exchange
of
wit
as
good
natured
as
it
was
horrifying
to
bridal
ears
so
said
a
huge
old
whitman
humorist
that
i
afterward
identified
as
brother
sam
white
as
he
clasped
both
my
hands
in
his
this
is
brother
thompson
new
wife
as
if
i
were
one
of
a
series
you
are
welcome
he
been
mightily
in
need
of
a
wife
to
perk
him
up
he
a
good
preacher
but
sorter
like
my
young
horse
selim
there
ai
a
better
colt
in
the
country
only
he
do
show
it
sperit
too
quiet
unless
i
lay
a
cuckle
bur
under
his
tail
and
your
husband
what
he
says
is
good
but
he
do
and
pitch
enough
he
skeer
young
sinners
around
here
with
jest
the
truth
he
must
learn
to
jump
up
and
down
and
with
it
all
this
was
delivered
in
a
bellowing
voice
that
fairly
shook
the
feathers
in
my
hat
and
it
indicates
the
quality
of
william
ministry
and
the
ideals
of
his
congregation
chapter
ii
i
build
for
myself
a
monument
more
enduring
than
brass
as
sister
glory
white
had
predicted
i
came
down
to
it
at
once
and
soon
learned
to
perform
the
usual
feminine
miracles
in
the
and
skillets
our
happiness
did
not
differ
from
the
happiness
of
other
young
married
people
except
that
it
was
abashed
morning
and
evening
with
family
prayers
occasions
when
thomas
the
cat
invariably
arose
with
an
air
of
outraged
and
withdrew
to
the
back
yard
william
had
long
active
itinerating
legs
in
those
days
a
slim
graceful
body
a
countenance
like
that
of
sir
walter
raleigh
and
eyes
that
must
have
been
like
saint
john
they
were
blue
and
had
in
them
the
far
eternal
look
and
in
the
years
to
come
i
was
to
learn
how
much
the
character
of
the
man
resembled
both
that
of
the
cavalier
and
the
saint
also
i
was
to
learn
that
it
was
no
light
matter
for
husband
to
have
descended
from
an
ecclesiastical
family
that
had
found
its
way
up
through
church
history
by
prayer
and
fasting
a
presbyterian
may
make
the
most
abiding
forefather
because
his
doctrinal
convictions
are
so
strong
they
prenatally
crimp
the
morals
of
those
who
come
after
him
and
it
may
be
that
a
methodist
ancestor
counts
for
less
in
the
third
and
fourth
generation
because
his
theology
is
too
genially
elastic
to
take
a
calvinistic
grip
upon
posterity
but
it
is
certain
that
he
will
impart
a
disposition
to
his
descendants
which
nothing
can
change
so
it
was
with
william
he
was
often
without
the
witness
of
the
spirit
but
i
never
knew
him
to
let
his
angel
go
he
had
a
genius
for
wrestling
in
prayer
as
another
man
might
have
for
writing
great
poetry
his
words
flew
together
into
coveys
when
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
rose
like
mourning
doves
to
heaven
or
they
would
be
like
high
notes
out
of
a
mood
of
the
soul
and
then
they
thundered
forth
from
his
lips
as
if
he
were
about
to
storm
the
gates
of
paradise
and
sometimes
in
the
dramatic
intensity
of
his
emotions
he
would
ask
for
the
most
terrifying
things
at
first
as
we
knelt
together
there
in
the
quiet
little
house
with
no
one
near
for
help
but
the
hills
i
was
alarmed
less
heaven
should
take
him
at
his
word
for
if
half
his
petitions
had
been
granted
we
could
not
have
lived
in
this
world
we
should
have
been
scattered
like
the
fine
dust
of
a
too
great
destiny
but
presently
when
nothing
adequate
to
them
happened
during
the
night
i
learned
to
have
more
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
god
and
less
in
william
with
him
prayer
was
simply
a
spiritual
obsession
based
upon
a
profound
sense
of
mortal
weakness
and
very
mystifying
to
his
young
wife
who
had
cheerfully
said
her
orisons
from
a
book
night
and
morning
with
an
easy
canterbury
conscience
the
saturday
after
our
marriage
i
accompanied
him
to
redwine
his
regular
appointment
it
was
the
custom
then
to
have
preaching
saturday
and
sunday
the
church
was
withdrawn
from
the
road
into
a
dim
forest
of
pines
black
and
mournful
here
and
there
horses
and
mules
bearing
saddles
or
dangling
harness
stood
slipshod
in
the
shade
switching
their
tails
at
innumerable
flies
near
the
door
was
the
group
of
men
one
always
sees
about
a
country
church
on
meeting
days
they
are
farmers
who
have
an
instinct
for
the
and
who
for
this
reason
will
not
go
in
till
the
last
moment
beyond
the
church
in
the
thicker
shadows
lay
its
dead
beneath
a
colony
of
staggering
gray
stones
upon
one
grave
i
remember
where
the
clay
was
freshly
turned
there
was
a
bouquet
of
flowers
love
protest
against
the
sonorous
sentence
earth
to
earth
and
dust
to
dust
which
the
other
graves
confirmed
the
pine
needles
lay
thick
above
them
and
not
a
flower
distinguished
them
from
the
common
sod
they
had
the
look
of
deeper
peace
the
long
untroubled
peace
of
sleepers
who
have
passed
out
of
the
memory
of
living
worrying
men
these
churchyards
for
the
dead
were
characteristic
features
in
country
circuits
and
i
mention
this
one
because
ever
after
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
just
inside
the
gateway
of
the
methodist
itinerancy
and
because
in
the
end
it
came
to
be
the
home
place
of
my
heart
i
had
never
before
been
in
a
methodist
church
a
certain
episcopalian
conceit
prevented
my
straying
into
the
one
at
edenton
and
i
was
shocked
now
at
the
old
testament
severity
of
this
one
there
was
no
compromise
with
human
desires
in
it
not
a
touch
of
color
except
the
brown
that
time
gives
unpainted
wood
not
an
effort
anywhere
to
appeal
to
the
imagination
or
suggest
holy
imagery
only
the
semicircular
altar
rail
about
the
narrow
box
pulpit
suggested
human
frailty
prayer
and
repentance
on
the
men
side
for
the
law
of
sex
was
observed
to
the
point
of
segregation
in
all
our
churches
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
men
with
red
strong
craggy
faces
who
appeared
to
have
the
adam
clod
highly
developed
in
them
a
in
expression
that
seemed
to
set
them
back
in
the
garden
and
to
hide
them
from
god
on
account
of
their
sins
on
the
other
side
there
was
more
lightness
more
life
and
hope
expressed
in
the
faces
of
the
younger
women
but
in
the
faces
of
the
old
there
was
the
same
outdone
look
of
nature
facing
god
there
was
no
service
from
the
standpoint
of
my
episcopal
rearing
just
a
hymn
a
prayer
and
then
william
took
his
text
the
beatitudes
all
of
them
i
have
since
heard
better
sermons
on
one
of
them
but
the
figure
of
him
standing
there
behind
the
high
pulpit
in
the
darkened
church
with
his
eyes
lifted
as
if
he
saw
angels
above
our
heads
has
never
faded
from
my
memory
nor
have
the
faces
of
the
old
women
in
their
black
sunbonnets
upturned
to
him
nor
the
drooping
shoulders
of
the
old
men
sitting
in
the
amen
corner
with
bowed
heads
somehow
there
was
a
reality
about
the
whole
scene
that
we
did
not
have
at
home
with
all
the
fine
music
and
accessories
he
had
reached
the
promise
to
the
blessed
peacemakers
in
the
course
of
his
sermon
the
calm
growing
deeper
in
his
eyes
and
the
high
look
whitening
on
his
brow
when
suddenly
a
woman
on
the
front
seat
stood
up
laid
her
sleeping
infant
on
the
floor
with
careful
deliberation
took
off
her
black
calico
bonnet
stepped
into
the
aisle
slapped
her
hands
together
and
began
to
spin
around
and
around
upon
her
toes
with
incredible
celerity
her
homespun
skirt
ballooned
about
her
the
ruffle
of
her
collar
stood
out
like
a
little
frill
of
white
neck
feathers
she
had
a
fixed
foolish
expression
maintained
an
energy
of
motion
that
was
persistent
and
amazing
and
gave
out
at
regular
intervals
a
short
staccato
squeal
that
was
scarcely
human
in
sound
not
a
word
was
spoken
william
himself
was
silenced
as
he
watched
the
strange
phenomenon
and
i
have
often
wondered
since
at
the
quality
of
that
courage
in
an
otherwise
shrinking
country
woman
which
could
cause
her
to
rise
take
the
service
out
of
the
preacher
hands
as
serenely
as
if
she
had
been
sent
from
god
and
this
is
what
she
really
believed
and
every
other
member
of
the
congregation
including
william
shared
the
belief
that
she
had
got
an
extraordinary
blessing
that
day
after
all
it
is
a
tremendous
blessing
to
believe
that
one
god
is
within
immediate
blessing
distance
in
this
connection
i
venture
to
add
that
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
lack
of
comprehension
which
gives
the
methodists
the
chief
reputation
for
emotional
religion
and
it
is
certainly
cheating
the
episcopalians
for
every
time
the
service
is
read
in
an
episcopal
church
the
congregation
shouts
the
responses
quietly
of
course
and
by
the
book
but
it
is
shouting
just
the
same
and
with
a
beseeching
use
of
words
both
joyful
and
agonizing
that
surpasses
any
sporadic
shouting
of
the
methodists
after
the
sermon
we
had
dinner
on
the
grounds
for
this
was
an
meeting
with
another
service
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
saturday
dinner
on
the
grounds
of
a
methodist
church
thirty
years
ago
was
a
function
that
appealed
to
the
threefold
nature
of
man
as
nothing
else
i
have
ever
seen
did
socially
speaking
all
the
best
people
in
the
community
were
present
the
real
best
people
you
understand
spiritually
it
was
an
occasion
hallowed
by
grave
conversation
for
were
we
not
within
the
shadow
of
god
house
in
the
sacred
presence
of
the
dead
it
was
gruesome
if
you
had
an
episcopalian
temperament
but
certainly
it
conduced
to
good
breeding
and
sobriety
but
more
particularly
there
was
the
dinner
itself
set
out
of
huge
hampers
on
white
cloths
that
appealed
to
the
natural
primitive
man
simply
and
honestly
without
a
single
pretense
of
delicacy
to
hide
the
real
grossness
of
the
human
appetite
on
this
day
plenty
strewed
the
ground
from
sister
glory
white
basket
to
sister
amy
jurdon
and
sister
salter
there
were
biscuit
the
size
of
saucers
and
of
the
thickness
of
bread
loaves
hams
baked
hens
roasted
pigs
more
biscuit
cucumber
pickles
six
inches
in
length
pies
custards
of
every
kind
and
disposition
and
cakes
that
proclaimed
the
skill
of
every
woman
in
the
church
william
advised
me
to
eat
as
i
had
never
eaten
before
or
the
women
would
think
i
did
not
like
their
cooking
and
would
be
correspondingly
offended
i
was
expected
to
consume
at
least
three
of
the
great
biscuit
and
everything
else
in
proportion
fortunately
i
sat
near
a
tangle
of
vines
in
which
i
discovered
a
dog
was
hiding
a
hound
who
gazed
imploringly
at
me
through
the
leaves
with
the
forlorn
expression
peculiar
to
his
species
as
much
as
to
say
do
tell
i
am
here
maybe
then
i
get
a
few
crumbs
later
on
i
not
only
did
not
tell
but
i
fed
him
eight
of
the
biscuit
five
slices
of
ham
and
nearly
everything
else
in
reach
of
me
except
the
cucumber
pickles
i
never
saw
a
dog
eat
more
furtively
or
so
well
meanwhile
i
was
raising
for
myself
a
monument
more
enduring
than
brass
in
the
hearts
of
my
husband
people
as
a
hardy
woman
who
could
make
herself
one
of
them
william
who
did
not
suspect
the
presence
of
the
dog
grew
faintly
alarmed
but
i
persevered
till
the
last
man
staggered
surfeited
from
the
feast
it
was
my
first
and
i
may
add
almost
my
only
triumph
as
a
minister
wife
on
a
backwoods
circuit
after
the
night
service
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
go
home
with
the
salters
to
spend
the
night
sister
salter
was
the
woman
who
had
received
the
blessing
brother
salter
was
not
a
brother
at
all
he
was
still
in
the
world
a
little
twopenny
man
with
a
thin
black
beard
sad
black
eyes
and
a
perch
mouth
but
he
was
not
proud
of
his
godless
state
especially
as
it
compared
with
his
wife
radiant
experience
he
was
literally
an
humble
sinner
and
showed
it
we
took
our
places
behind
them
in
chairs
in
the
wagon
sister
salter
was
still
in
her
baptismal
mood
and
as
we
rumbled
on
into
the
deepening
twilight
through
the
sweeting
spring
woods
she
continued
to
sing
snatches
from
the
old
hymns
higher
and
higher
her
fine
treble
voice
arose
till
the
homing
birds
answered
and
every
living
thing
in
the
forest
felt
the
throb
of
the
poignant
melody
everything
except
the
baby
on
her
breast
it
slept
on
as
soundly
as
if
it
breathed
her
peace
into
its
soft
little
body
night
had
fallen
when
we
reached
the
house
a
log
cabin
light
and
go
in
said
brother
salter
i
reckon
the
children
air
all
in
bed
you
kin
ondress
and
git
in
while
me
and
sally
unhitches
the
horse
we
lit
and
entered
the
large
room
flooded
with
moonshining
there
was
a
bed
in
each
corner
and
all
occupied
save
one
this
was
evidently
the
company
bed
we
knew
by
its
opulent
feather
paunch
by
the
counterpane
and
by
the
bearing
soporific
mottoes
worked
in
thread
one
could
not
tell
the
age
of
or
how
many
persons
were
already
asleep
in
the
other
beds
but
judging
from
the
number
and
varying
sizes
of
the
shoes
that
staggered
and
kicked
up
on
the
floor
beside
them
there
must
have
been
a
hearty
dozen
ranging
all
the
way
from
adolescence
down
to
infancy
it
is
needless
to
add
that
we
were
apparently
asleep
and
the
covers
over
my
horrified
head
when
the
elder
salters
entered
where
they
slept
is
still
a
mystery
but
we
were
awakened
very
early
the
next
morning
by
the
sound
of
sister
salter
voice
singing
his
loving
kindness
oh
how
good
as
she
rattled
the
stove
doors
beneath
the
cookshed
in
the
yard
three
very
young
children
were
sitting
half
under
our
bed
examining
our
shoes
and
other
articles
of
apparel
and
as
many
older
heads
stared
at
us
from
the
opposite
beds
my
anguish
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
and
the
nonchalance
with
which
william
arose
and
assumed
his
trousers
did
not
add
to
my
opinion
of
him
i
afterward
learned
that
nothing
was
more
common
than
this
populous
way
of
entertaining
guests
and
that
he
had
long
since
become
hardened
to
the
indelicacies
of
such
situations
chapter
iii
the
revival
at
redwine
but
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
social
and
spiritual
surprises
through
which
i
passed
there
was
no
culture
among
the
people
they
looked
like
the
poor
kin
of
the
angels
in
heaven
and
they
really
did
live
so
far
out
of
the
world
that
no
bishop
had
ever
seen
them
i
was
divided
between
horror
and
admiration
at
their
propensities
and
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
shock
with
which
i
faced
the
perpetual
exposure
of
their
spiritual
nakedness
it
was
a
naïve
kind
of
religious
indelicacy
like
the
unguarded
ways
of
very
young
children
brother
jimmie
meadows
would
confess
to
the
most
private
faults
in
an
experience
meeting
and
if
he
did
not
sister
meadows
would
do
it
for
him
they
lacked
the
sense
of
humor
which
being
interpreted
is
a
part
of
the
sense
of
proportion
they
shrank
from
the
illuminating
quality
of
wit
as
if
it
were
a
sacrilege
this
was
even
an
important
part
of
william
character
he
put
on
solemnity
like
a
robe
when
he
was
in
the
throes
of
thought
the
deadly
monotony
of
christian
country
life
where
there
are
no
beggars
to
feed
no
drunkards
to
credit
which
are
among
the
moral
duties
of
christians
in
cities
leads
as
naturally
to
the
outvent
of
what
methodists
call
revivals
as
did
the
backslidings
of
the
people
in
those
days
so
it
came
to
pass
that
year
at
redwine
when
the
crops
were
laid
by
william
faced
his
first
revival
and
i
faced
william
spiritually
speaking
we
parted
company
he
passed
into
a
praying
and
fasting
trance
and
my
heart
was
nearly
broken
with
the
loneliness
for
praying
and
fasting
did
not
agree
with
me
and
william
seemed
to
recede
in
some
mystical
sense
hard
to
define
so
that
i
became
a
sort
of
unwilling
the
revival
was
to
begin
at
redwine
when
suddenly
the
rumor
reached
us
that
brother
tom
pratt
a
prominent
member
had
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
there
in
a
spiritual
way
until
he
was
reclaimed
he
was
a
large
fair
man
with
a
long
straw
beard
hanging
under
his
chin
and
he
was
said
to
be
mightily
gifted
in
prayer
but
his
besetting
sin
was
strong
drink
and
he
had
recently
been
drunk
the
simplicity
with
which
william
went
about
reclaiming
him
as
a
part
of
the
preparation
for
the
coming
revival
seemed
to
me
almost
too
premeditatedly
spiritual
illustration
brother
tom
pratt
a
prominent
member
had
backslided
the
revival
proceeded
at
first
with
awful
chilliness
at
length
with
flickering
warmth
at
last
after
a
very
moving
sermon
on
the
prodigal
son
the
altar
suddenly
filled
with
penitents
i
have
often
thought
of
it
the
tenderness
with
which
the
good
god
founded
our
scriptures
for
us
so
they
would
fit
the
human
heart
to
the
uttermost
generations
of
men
that
story
of
the
prodigal
is
the
eternal
love
message
from
him
to
us
preach
it
anywhere
and
the
aching
shamed
dissolute
rebel
in
us
trembles
and
wants
to
come
home
here
in
this
hill
settlement
where
scarcely
any
man
had
been
ten
miles
from
where
he
was
born
it
seemed
that
a
hundred
had
been
secret
vagabonds
in
the
terrible
far
country
when
the
altar
was
full
to
suffocation
william
called
on
brother
tom
pratt
to
lead
us
in
prayer
and
he
led
us
through
a
long
night
into
the
very
morning
of
god
i
wish
it
were
the
fashion
to
call
oftener
on
outbreaking
sinners
to
pray
in
church
usually
they
have
a
stronger
sense
of
the
immediateness
of
the
lord
than
the
saints
do
and
many
a
time
since
that
night
have
i
listened
to
the
eloquence
of
better
men
in
prayer
but
never
have
i
heard
a
nobler
petition
for
the
forgiveness
of
sin
the
church
was
a
darkened
space
rimmed
with
light
from
tallow
candles
standing
on
wooden
brackets
around
the
walls
and
the
space
was
filled
with
the
bowed
forms
of
men
and
women
near
the
pulpit
there
was
more
light
falling
upon
the
dejected
figures
of
the
penitents
clinging
to
the
altar
rail
within
the
rail
kneeling
facing
them
william
face
gleamed
like
the
death
mask
of
prayer
there
was
a
silence
then
a
voice
arose
from
somewhere
out
of
the
deeper
shadows
timid
beseeching
at
first
like
a
sad
messenger
of
the
outer
darkness
who
had
known
all
the
torments
of
hell
and
trembled
now
before
the
throne
of
heaven
but
as
the
bearer
of
the
petition
gained
courage
from
his
very
woes
the
volume
of
his
voice
increased
until
it
filled
the
church
the
rafters
shook
and
sinners
fell
prostrate
in
the
chancel
this
however
was
only
the
beginning
the
great
opera
of
brother
pratt
spirit
went
on
like
a
rude
wagnerian
measure
until
none
could
resist
it
men
arose
from
their
knees
shouting
finally
the
who
had
risen
in
his
passion
and
stood
praying
with
his
hands
above
his
head
reaching
visibly
for
salvation
fell
exhausted
to
the
floor
the
scene
is
no
less
amazing
to
me
now
as
i
recall
it
than
it
was
that
night
thirty
years
ago
as
i
sat
a
trembling
bride
in
the
remotest
corner
praying
privately
and
fervently
that
the
lord
would
spare
me
the
sight
of
william
taking
part
in
it
i
felt
that
if
he
did
i
should
ever
after
have
some
earth
fear
of
him
if
preachers
could
only
preach
without
thrusting
us
up
too
close
to
the
awful
elbows
of
god
before
our
time
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
always
to
conclude
a
methodist
revival
with
a
love
feast
you
can
not
have
it
where
you
can
not
have
an
revival
one
of
the
coldest
functions
i
ever
attended
was
a
love
feast
in
a
fashionable
methodist
church
at
the
end
of
a
series
of
meetings
the
men
wore
tuxedos
and
the
women
wore
party
gowns
of
course
on
account
of
its
being
a
church
affair
and
the
only
difference
between
that
and
any
other
social
function
was
that
a
good
many
people
were
present
whom
the
fashionable
members
never
invited
to
their
own
homes
and
whom
they
treated
with
offensive
cordiality
on
this
occasion
but
at
the
end
of
the
revival
at
redwine
there
was
a
real
love
feast
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
due
to
the
honorable
curiosity
in
the
neighborhood
to
know
who
would
testify
who
would
confess
his
fault
or
proclaim
that
he
had
forgiven
some
brother
man
about
a
line
fence
between
their
farms
or
a
shoat
it
was
indeed
a
sort
of
dun
and
bradstreet
opportunity
to
know
the
exact
spiritual
standing
of
every
man
and
woman
in
the
community
and
it
was
william
plan
that
the
service
should
be
held
in
the
evening
under
the
great
pines
torches
of
lightwood
furnished
the
illumination
william
stood
beside
a
small
table
facing
the
congregation
who
were
seated
on
the
benches
that
had
been
brought
out
of
the
church
after
a
song
and
a
prayer
that
must
have
made
the
old
saints
sit
up
on
their
dust
in
the
graveyard
behind
the
church
to
listen
william
gave
the
customary
invitation
brethren
and
sisters
he
said
we
have
had
a
gracious
meeting
and
a
mighty
outpouring
of
the
spirit
it
is
meet
and
proper
for
those
who
have
been
helped
who
feel
that
their
sins
are
forgiven
who
aim
to
live
a
new
life
to
get
up
and
say
so
and
thus
burn
the
bridges
behind
them
come
out
on
the
lord
side
so
everybody
can
see
where
you
stand
i
leave
the
meeting
open
to
you
brother
thompson
said
a
gray
old
man
with
meal
on
his
coat
i
feel
that
i
have
been
blessed
durin
this
meetin
and
i
ask
the
prayers
of
all
christian
people
that
i
may
continue
faithful
to
the
end
amen
said
william
and
there
were
general
grunts
of
approval
for
the
miller
was
known
to
be
a
wonderfully
good
man
brother
thompson
said
a
strange
shaggy
young
adam
i
feel
that
my
sins
are
forgiven
me
and
that
i
am
a
child
of
god
i
ask
the
prayers
of
all
christian
people
that
i
may
continue
faithful
he
was
a
moonshiner
who
had
destroyed
his
whisky
and
cut
up
his
own
copper
worm
and
vats
during
the
meeting
as
he
resumed
his
seat
a
little
thin
woman
in
a
blue
cotton
dress
sprang
to
her
feet
hopped
with
the
belligerent
air
of
a
fighting
jaybird
across
the
intervening
space
and
lost
herself
in
the
arms
of
the
regenerated
moonshiner
she
was
his
wife
the
good
woman
who
stayed
at
home
and
prayed
for
him
of
nights
now
she
shouted
and
beat
a
tender
tattoo
with
her
little
brown
hands
upon
his
bowed
head
i
jest
ca
help
shoutin
she
cried
i
so
glad
he
done
it
he
had
done
it
three
times
before
reformed
only
to
fall
again
so
soon
as
the
corn
was
gathered
in
the
fall
no
one
had
confidence
in
him
save
this
little
heart
who
loved
him
it
is
no
wonder
women
believe
in
god
easier
than
anyone
else
does
they
can
believe
with
so
little
reason
in
men
after
this
followed
several
triumphant
testimonies
sister
glory
white
began
to
shout
sweetly
and
quietly
in
the
amen
corner
slapping
her
fat
hands
together
and
whispering
softly
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
praise
his
holy
name
presently
there
was
an
interruption
william
had
made
the
mistake
of
confiding
one
of
the
torches
to
brother
billy
fleming
a
holiness
man
suddenly
he
leaped
into
the
air
shouting
and
brandishing
his
blaze
in
every
direction
the
paroxysm
of
joy
was
short
however
and
when
quiet
was
restored
in
the
deeper
darkness
for
brother
torch
had
gone
out
a
tall
man
arose
from
near
the
middle
of
the
congregation
he
had
a
bushy
brown
beard
a
little
apostrophe
nose
childish
eyes
and
a
thin
high
voice
which
gave
the
impression
upon
hearing
it
that
he
was
at
the
very
moment
trying
hard
to
squeeze
through
the
eye
of
his
needle
spiritually
speaking
i
recognized
him
as
brother
john
henry
distinguished
for
having
the
most
sensitive
conscience
of
any
man
in
the
church
now
he
stood
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
too
deeply
moved
for
a
moment
to
speak
everyone
leaned
forward
for
it
was
always
a
matter
of
interest
to
know
what
else
was
troubling
brother
henry
soul
at
last
in
a
quavering
treble
he
confessed
with
the
air
of
one
doomed
to
suffer
terrible
disappointment
brother
thompson
you
know
all
of
you
know
i
try
to
be
a
good
man
but
the
flesh
is
weak
i
git
tempted
and
fall
into
sin
before
i
know
it
i
sufferin
remorse
now
i
set
my
old
dominique
hen
twice
and
cheated
her
into
hatchin
two
broods
of
chickens
without
givin
her
a
day
rest
between
settin
my
remorse
is
worse
a
man
apologize
to
a
hen
or
make
restitution
such
rarefied
confessions
were
common
and
this
was
one
of
many
occasions
when
i
disgraced
william
by
snickering
in
the
solemn
pause
which
followed
however
these
faded
daguerreotypes
of
memory
suggest
but
faintly
any
idea
of
the
people
with
whom
i
began
my
life
as
a
minister
wife
i
can
only
show
their
narrowness
i
am
not
able
to
give
the
shrill
high
notes
of
faith
in
their
lives
they
made
an
awful
business
of
being
good
and
the
contrast
between
them
and
the
witty
people
of
the
world
was
startling
indeed
but
more
to
their
credit
than
some
are
accustomed
to
think
chapter
iv
william
as
a
leader
of
forlorn
hope
for
spiritual
beings
we
do
take
with
singular
heartiness
to
the
soil
and
spoils
of
this
present
world
the
hope
of
immortality
is
more
a
fear
than
a
hope
with
many
of
us
we
do
not
like
to
see
the
open
door
of
death
that
leads
to
it
so
every
good
preacher
is
the
shepherd
of
our
misgivings
the
leader
of
our
forlornest
hopes
the
captain
more
particularly
of
men
and
women
who
are
about
to
die
or
who
are
seeking
heaven
at
last
in
a
state
of
earthly
disappointment
and
world
exhaustion
i
have
rarely
known
a
person
in
good
health
morally
and
physically
fortunately
situated
in
life
who
voluntarily
sought
the
consolations
of
religion
i
reckon
the
lord
knew
what
he
was
about
when
he
turned
his
back
and
let
satan
fill
creation
with
snares
and
pitfalls
and
sorrows
and
temptations
if
we
did
not
fall
into
so
many
of
them
we
should
never
get
the
proper
contrite
spirit
to
seek
of
our
own
will
and
accord
after
salvation
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
thrust
it
upon
us
and
we
might
have
been
no
better
than
the
angels
without
the
great
privilege
of
sinning
our
own
sins
or
choosing
our
own
virtues
william
was
especially
qualified
for
this
business
of
leading
hope
after
it
had
done
with
all
earthly
ties
he
was
intellectually
opposed
to
what
we
know
as
reality
he
entertained
topographical
convictions
concerning
the
new
jerusalem
and
he
could
give
information
about
the
father
house
as
the
old
family
homestead
of
the
soul
so
definitely
that
one
could
see
the
angels
on
the
gables
and
the
tree
of
life
shading
the
front
yard
the
simplest
man
in
the
congregation
listened
with
enthusiasm
and
found
himself
recollecting
it
as
if
he
were
recalling
scenes
from
his
first
life
but
eternity
is
a
danger
none
of
us
can
avoid
and
it
never
seemed
spiritually
intelligent
to
me
for
christians
to
struggle
so
in
that
direction
indeed
they
do
not
really
that
enthusiasm
is
but
the
name
of
the
pathetic
courage
with
which
they
go
to
meet
death
because
they
have
to
go
i
recall
the
thanksgiving
prayer
of
brother
billy
fleming
in
this
connection
in
every
experience
meeting
one
part
of
his
testimony
was
always
in
standing
type
the
ambition
to
be
at
home
in
glory
and
particularly
to
rest
in
abraham
bosom
but
when
a
long
fever
brought
him
almost
within
kissing
distance
of
abraham
beard
he
made
a
mighty
prayer
that
god
would
spare
his
weak
and
unprofitable
life
not
only
that
but
william
was
called
in
to
add
his
own
petitions
which
he
did
throughout
the
night
of
the
crisis
of
the
fever
i
remained
in
the
next
room
with
sister
fleming
a
little
silent
saint
who
went
about
the
world
like
a
candle
moving
in
a
dark
place
merely
letting
her
light
so
shine
when
the
night
deepened
and
we
sat
in
it
clasped
hand
in
hand
listening
to
the
prayer
concert
in
the
sick
man
room
i
ventured
to
propound
a
question
sister
fleming
i
whispered
i
can
understand
why
you
want
brother
fleming
to
live
and
why
the
rest
of
us
do
but
i
ca
understand
why
he
has
changed
his
mind
so
completely
and
wants
so
much
to
live
himself
i
have
heard
him
say
so
often
that
he
was
not
only
ready
and
willing
to
go
but
just
longing
to
be
with
abraham
honey
she
replied
in
the
tone
with
which
a
mother
speaks
of
the
childishness
of
children
them
one
of
the
curiosities
of
the
christian
religion
the
things
persons
like
billy
tells
in
experience
meetings
i
do
reckon
the
lord
takes
the
trouble
to
even
forgive
they
air
so
foolish
i
know
billy
from
a
to
izzard
and
so
far
from
layin
on
abraham
bosom
he
could
git
along
with
him
till
daybreak
he
jest
gits
that
talk
out
of
his
ambition
and
imagination
although
humanly
speakin
billy
is
a
tolerably
good
man
and
i
reckon
the
lord
will
have
any
cause
to
fling
off
on
him
when
his
time
comes
but
you
can
jest
set
this
down
nobody
in
his
right
mind
feels
the
way
most
folks
say
they
feel
in
an
experience
meeting
as
a
matter
of
fact
brother
fleming
made
a
public
thanksgiving
prayer
at
the
altar
in
redwine
church
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
get
out
this
deliverance
from
a
woman
of
such
beautiful
integrity
was
a
comfort
to
me
for
while
i
endeavored
to
be
a
christian
along
with
william
i
have
never
been
religious
to
feel
consciously
religious
is
in
my
opinion
to
become
a
sort
of
bounder
and
we
all
know
how
repulsive
a
bounder
is
in
any
circle
of
society
this
is
the
objection
to
the
holiness
people
they
are
presumptuous
in
professing
a
too
intimate
likeness
and
relation
to
god
i
have
never
seen
a
sanctified
man
or
woman
yet
whose
spirituality
bore
nearly
so
noble
a
resemblance
to
him
as
the
sad
soul
of
some
sinner
who
had
had
his
vision
of
unattainable
holiness
i
am
thankful
that
william
was
never
guilty
of
the
temptation
to
call
himself
sanctified
sanctification
is
a
good
thing
to
preach
and
a
better
thing
to
strive
after
but
the
minute
a
man
professes
it
he
becomes
less
truthful
and
less
intelligent
spiritually
and
he
proceeds
to
develop
along
these
lessening
lines
still
while
william
did
not
outrage
my
reverence
for
him
by
a
too
high
profession
i
found
him
hard
enough
to
follow
when
during
the
first
year
sabbath
after
sabbath
i
saw
him
quicken
the
spirit
of
his
congregation
with
hymns
and
prayers
and
then
taking
his
text
for
a
motto
banner
start
for
the
outskirts
of
eternity
i
was
probably
the
one
person
in
his
congregation
who
hung
back
for
conscientious
reasons
i
looked
at
the
weary
people
in
the
church
with
such
sad
hunger
in
their
faces
and
then
i
looked
through
the
open
windows
at
the
fair
fields
spread
like
love
promises
of
peace
to
us
in
this
life
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
possibly
they
had
missed
the
cue
somewhere
and
i
declined
to
make
even
a
spiritual
investigation
of
that
country
beyond
where
the
scenes
of
william
sermons
were
always
laid
very
soon
i
experienced
also
a
woman
fear
that
eventually
i
should
lose
some
near
and
dear
sense
of
my
husband
there
is
in
fact
a
capacity
for
heavenly
infidelity
to
earthly
ties
in
most
preachers
and
the
martyrdom
of
forsaking
father
and
mother
and
even
his
wife
in
the
spirit
appealed
to
his
spiritual
aspirations
many
a
woman
has
been
deserted
in
this
subtle
manner
by
her
minister
husband
but
i
kept
the
fear
of
it
to
myself
never
encouraging
this
attenuated
form
of
piety
in
him
by
even
opposing
it
meanwhile
i
began
to
observe
with
very
genuine
admiration
his
heroism
in
leading
forlorn
hopes
illustration
with
such
sad
hunger
in
their
faces
this
brings
me
to
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
a
circuit
rider
that
of
piloting
the
dying
through
the
last
shallows
of
the
great
sea
there
is
where
hope
is
forlornest
and
where
william
was
bravest
pastors
of
fashionable
churches
rarely
perform
this
office
now
it
seems
that
an
church
member
regards
dying
so
private
as
to
suggest
the
idea
that
some
disgrace
attaches
to
it
the
minister
calls
indeed
speaks
cheerfully
and
conventionally
of
the
hereafter
as
of
an
opulent
and
famous
city
with
a
salubrious
climate
he
congratulates
the
candidate
for
immediate
residence
upon
his
new
citizenship
and
takes
his
departure
without
the
risk
of
disturbing
his
temperature
with
a
hymn
or
a
prayer
the
proper
time
for
both
of
these
will
be
when
he
officiates
later
over
the
remains
i
have
sometimes
wondered
how
a
fashionable
person
feels
who
is
obliged
even
to
die
by
the
doctor
orders
and
according
to
convention
repressing
to
the
last
those
great
emotions
that
have
made
us
men
instead
of
clods
far
away
in
the
country
death
brings
more
distinction
there
men
and
women
have
walked
a
lifetime
in
the
fields
they
have
seen
the
sun
rise
and
set
the
stars
shine
the
rain
fall
the
corn
grow
all
by
the
will
of
god
and
at
the
very
last
they
are
crowded
by
their
great
thoughts
of
him
excited
by
the
encroaching
fact
of
his
tremendous
nearness
they
need
a
priest
some
one
who
has
been
ordained
to
lead
them
into
the
presence
they
have
a
sense
of
their
ruggedness
their
unkempt
earthiness
and
their
general
unfitness
for
the
great
ceremony
the
preacher
must
hold
their
hands
until
they
cross
the
doorsill
of
the
audience
chamber
now
i
will
not
say
that
william
enjoyed
officiating
on
these
occasions
but
they
thrilled
him
increased
his
faith
and
it
touched
me
to
the
very
heaven
of
my
heart
when
i
discovered
that
if
the
dying
man
was
unconverted
an
outbreaking
sinner
he
was
wont
to
omit
the
harder
doctrines
and
generously
lift
him
to
the
lord
in
prayer
upon
the
easy
pledge
of
faith
the
methodists
are
especially
prepared
by
the
very
softness
of
their
creed
to
afford
quick
relief
to
the
dying
just
repent
and
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
be
saved
looking
back
through
the
years
across
many
many
graves
it
seems
to
me
i
can
see
the
footprints
of
william
shining
yet
in
the
dark
of
death
nights
as
he
journeyed
forth
to
whisper
hope
into
pale
ears
and
to
offer
his
strange
unearthly
consolation
to
those
about
to
be
left
behind
very
soon
after
we
were
married
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
one
night
and
a
voice
crying
come
quick
brother
thompson
old
davy
dyer
is
dyin
doctor
says
he
ca
last
till
daybreak
and
he
hollerin
for
a
preacher
same
as
if
he
had
been
god
all
his
life
davy
dyer
was
the
blacksmith
and
the
only
infidel
in
the
country
a
grimy
old
vulcan
with
white
beard
and
the
eagle
implacable
eye
one
of
william
braveries
was
to
go
there
to
have
his
horse
shod
and
to
sit
upon
the
edge
of
the
anvil
block
while
it
was
being
done
and
gently
try
to
wheedle
him
toward
heaven
now
however
at
last
he
was
to
have
the
best
of
the
argument
davy
was
dying
about
to
be
turned
out
of
the
house
and
home
of
his
spirit
and
he
wanted
the
preacher
to
help
him
find
another
he
must
have
another
no
matter
how
intelligent
a
man
is
or
how
scientific
his
method
is
there
is
something
in
him
that
ca
think
back
to
an
unknown
formula
that
belongs
to
the
unknown
the
time
was
very
short
and
william
hurried
away
as
if
he
had
doves
on
his
feet
and
the
words
of
eternal
life
on
his
lips
he
returned
in
the
opal
dawn
of
the
summer
morning
whitened
and
weary
but
in
his
high
ceremonial
mood
he
died
in
the
faith
he
answered
calmly
i
had
my
doubts
my
sniffing
canterbury
doubts
but
the
bland
light
upon
his
face
an
incandescence
that
he
managed
from
somewhere
within
silenced
me
i
never
meddled
with
the
coals
on
william
altar
and
not
long
after
the
shriving
of
the
infidel
i
had
an
unexpected
opportunity
to
observe
how
easy
he
made
it
for
his
people
to
die
in
the
faith
we
were
living
a
perfectly
human
day
among
the
roses
and
sagebushes
and
bumblebees
in
our
little
garden
when
word
came
that
salter
had
been
suddenly
stricken
and
was
about
to
die
without
the
witness
of
the
spirit
there
was
a
row
of
dahlias
behind
the
sagebushes
requiring
attention
and
we
had
been
so
normally
digging
about
their
roots
william
had
been
so
like
other
young
men
in
his
digressions
that
i
could
not
help
being
depressed
at
the
interruption
it
seemed
that
some
shadow
of
the
other
world
was
forever
falling
between
us
we
came
up
out
of
our
garden
william
harnessed
his
horse
put
on
his
black
coat
changed
his
expression
and
we
drove
away
on
our
sad
mission
for
custom
required
that
the
pastor
wife
should
accompany
him
upon
such
occasions
her
care
was
to
look
after
the
stricken
surviving
members
of
the
family
while
he
gave
his
attention
more
particularly
to
the
passing
one
she
must
be
ready
to
do
anything
from
cooking
the
next
meal
to
shrouding
the
corpse
the
latter
is
a
particularly
garrulous
business
and
i
was
horrified
to
discover
that
it
was
so
gruesomely
entertaining
to
the
women
of
the
church
and
neighbors
who
helped
my
first
corpse
was
the
young
wife
of
a
farmer
who
had
died
of
the
fever
as
usual
sister
fleming
and
sister
glory
white
had
helped
me
lay
her
out
and
each
vied
with
the
other
as
to
the
number
and
condition
of
the
bodies
they
had
prepared
for
burial
incidentally
comparing
points
between
them
and
the
present
one
the
grand
dignity
of
the
dead
woman
face
did
not
appall
them
but
it
frightened
me
o
sister
white
i
whispered
trembling
and
covering
my
eyes
from
the
sight
of
them
cackling
about
the
awfully
disheveled
bed
and
its
burden
do
talk
so
before
her
she
looks
so
much
above
us
lor
child
you
git
used
to
it
they
all
have
it
that
grand
look
when
they
air
dead
it
do
mean
nothin
once
i
out
a
bad
woman
there
was
another
person
in
the
settlement
that
would
touch
her
so
i
done
it
and
of
all
the
corpses
i
ever
put
away
she
had
the
grandest
look
it
sorter
staggered
me
till
i
thought
at
last
it
was
maybe
the
rest
that
come
to
her
after
the
pain
of
sinnin
had
gone
out
of
her
body
but
you
not
be
so
squeamish
about
the
way
folks
look
when
they
air
dead
after
a
while
we
had
one
pastor
wife
that
helped
lay
out
fourteen
bodies
but
that
was
the
year
of
the
epidemic
she
concluded
leaning
over
to
stretch
the
shroud
sheet
little
did
i
think
then
that
i
was
already
upon
the
eve
of
an
experience
that
would
far
eclipse
the
record
of
that
other
wife
we
found
sister
salter
lying
dim
and
white
upon
her
bed
surrounded
by
her
family
and
friends
and
the
supreme
tragedy
of
the
hour
for
them
was
not
her
approaching
dissolution
but
it
was
that
one
who
had
testified
so
often
and
so
victoriously
of
her
faith
had
lost
it
at
the
crucial
moment
what
followed
is
impossible
to
describe
it
was
not
the
terrible
silence
in
the
crowded
room
not
the
battling
breath
and
the
shriveling
features
of
the
woman
in
the
bed
not
by
contrast
the
green
and
happy
calm
of
the
world
outside
but
it
was
the
awful
voice
of
authority
with
which
william
spoke
of
things
that
no
man
knows
that
frightened
and
thrilled
us
if
he
had
called
me
so
from
a
grave
where
i
had
lain
a
thousand
years
i
should
have
had
to
put
on
my
dust
rise
and
answer
him
he
sat
beside
the
bed
and
looked
as
peter
must
have
looked
at
dorcas
as
she
lay
dead
in
the
upper
chamber
of
her
house
at
joppa
it
was
not
the
text
he
quoted
nor
the
hymns
he
chanted
but
it
was
the
way
he
did
it
clearly
he
was
adding
his
faith
to
her
forlorn
hope
we
saw
her
face
change
as
if
she
had
risen
and
was
treading
the
waters
in
her
spirit
to
meet
an
invisible
presence
the
fading
light
of
the
summer
day
showed
the
same
rapt
look
on
it
that
was
there
when
she
shouted
that
first
sunday
at
redwine
and
she
passed
like
a
sudden
gleam
into
the
darkness
of
the
coming
night
william
joy
was
beautiful
to
see
but
i
had
a
sense
of
intrusion
as
if
i
had
parted
the
wings
of
some
archangel
and
had
seen
more
brightness
than
it
was
lawful
for
a
mortal
to
behold
so
long
as
we
are
on
this
earth
it
seems
to
me
better
to
follow
the
example
of
moses
and
turn
our
backs
when
the
lord
passes
by
so
that
we
shall
see
only
the
glory
of
his
hinder
parts
the
death
of
sister
salter
marked
the
beginning
of
an
epidemic
or
rather
the
return
of
the
same
one
they
had
had
some
years
before
it
swept
through
the
community
with
such
deadly
results
that
not
a
family
escaped
and
i
had
another
view
of
the
ministerial
character
william
spent
all
his
time
in
the
stricken
homes
of
his
people
it
was
not
a
sense
of
duty
or
conscience
or
courage
that
caused
him
to
face
the
deadly
disease
with
such
fortitude
but
it
was
the
instinct
of
the
shepherd
for
his
flock
and
he
readily
permitted
me
to
accompany
him
with
the
curious
indifference
to
consequences
shown
by
those
who
have
had
their
heads
grandly
turned
by
heavenly
thoughts
life
meant
little
to
him
immortality
meant
everything
he
risked
his
own
life
and
the
life
of
his
wife
because
it
is
the
nature
of
the
true
priest
to
care
more
for
his
people
than
he
does
for
himself
or
his
wife
just
as
it
is
the
nature
of
the
good
shepherd
to
lay
down
his
life
for
his
sheep
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
we
had
buried
half
the
membership
of
redwine
church
and
had
received
the
secrets
of
many
passing
souls
for
a
man
can
not
die
with
his
secret
in
him
it
belongs
to
history
and
will
not
be
buried
one
old
woman
sister
fanny
claris
who
had
been
a
faithful
member
of
our
church
for
years
confessed
to
william
at
the
very
last
that
she
had
always
wanted
to
be
a
baptist
but
that
her
husband
had
been
a
methodist
and
she
had
gone
with
him
if
i
could
have
been
put
clean
under
the
water
when
i
and
not
had
sech
a
little
jest
flung
on
my
head
seems
as
if
i
feel
safer
now
she
wailed
and
i
took
the
lord
supper
with
sinners
and
all
kinds
when
it
was
in
my
conscience
to
be
more
particular
and
take
it
communion
style
like
the
baptists
besides
i
have
believed
in
the
doctrine
of
election
all
my
life
and
i
ai
noways
sho
about
mine
now
although
i
tried
to
do
my
duty
the
fading
eyes
looked
at
us
out
of
the
old
face
sternly
crimped
with
the
wrinkles
she
had
made
working
for
god
under
an
alien
creed
my
soul
never
been
satisfied
not
for
a
single
day
in
your
church
with
its
easy
ways
and
shiftless
doctrines
she
concluded
faintly
for
once
william
was
silenced
it
was
not
an
occasion
upon
which
to
vindicate
methodism
in
an
argument
neither
did
he
have
enough
tautness
of
conviction
concerning
certain
terrible
doctrines
to
meet
the
emergency
of
her
dogmatic
needs
and
so
she
passed
unshriven
to
the
mercies
of
a
god
who
is
doubtless
sufficiently
to
have
such
baptisms
properly
attended
to
somewhere
in
heaven
chapter
v
god
annuals
but
the
dying
are
not
the
only
ones
who
suffer
most
from
the
sickness
of
their
hopes
there
are
men
with
beautiful
souls
born
with
little
devil
seeds
in
them
somewhere
that
grow
like
immoral
perennials
and
poison
the
goodness
in
them
they
are
the
people
who
backslide
so
often
who
repent
so
thoroughly
and
who
flourish
like
green
bay
trees
spiritually
when
they
flourish
at
all
they
are
usually
regarded
as
moral
weaklings
and
it
is
the
fashion
of
saints
to
despise
them
this
is
because
some
righteous
people
now
as
in
christ
day
are
the
meanest
moral
snobs
the
world
can
produce
many
of
them
are
too
mean
even
to
afford
the
extravagance
of
a
transgression
and
rarely
indeed
do
you
see
one
with
courage
enough
to
erect
himself
again
morally
once
he
has
fallen
or
been
discovered
as
fallen
but
among
the
backsliders
of
the
class
i
have
mentioned
you
will
find
the
bravest
moral
heroes
of
the
spiritual
world
men
who
have
the
courage
to
repent
and
try
again
with
an
enthusiasm
that
is
sublime
in
the
face
of
the
lack
of
confidence
expressed
in
them
on
all
sides
they
are
a
distinct
class
and
as
we
went
on
in
the
itinerancy
i
learned
to
call
them
god
annuals
and
william
never
was
more
beautifully
ordained
or
inspired
than
when
he
was
engaged
in
transplanting
one
of
those
out
of
his
sins
again
into
the
sweet
soil
of
faith
he
had
a
holy
gift
for
it
that
was
as
naïve
as
it
was
industrious
i
recall
one
of
these
annuals
on
the
redwine
circuit
he
was
a
slim
wild
young
fellow
with
a
kind
of
radiance
about
him
sometimes
it
was
of
angels
and
sometimes
of
the
devil
but
he
always
had
it
an
ineffable
charm
he
was
brown
and
with
a
level
look
that
hero
warriors
have
and
that
was
his
trouble
he
was
made
for
emergencies
not
for
the
long
daily
siege
of
life
he
was
equally
capable
of
killing
an
enemy
or
of
dying
for
a
friend
but
he
could
not
live
for
himself
soberly
and
well
for
more
than
forty
days
at
a
time
still
he
had
a
soul
i
never
doubted
it
though
i
have
often
doubted
if
some
of
the
ablest
members
in
our
church
had
them
and
if
they
were
not
wearing
themselves
out
for
a
foolish
anticipation
if
they
expected
eternal
life
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
behave
himself
all
the
days
of
his
life
without
developing
the
spiritual
sense
i
do
not
say
that
such
people
have
not
got
souls
but
if
they
get
to
heaven
at
all
it
will
be
in
the
form
of
granitoid
nuts
and
the
angels
will
have
to
crack
them
with
a
thor
hammer
before
they
can
find
the
thing
that
they
kept
for
a
soul
but
jack
stark
our
redwine
annual
was
too
much
the
other
way
his
soul
was
not
enough
inside
of
him
it
was
the
wind
in
his
boughs
that
blows
where
it
listeth
periodically
he
went
on
a
spree
it
was
his
effort
to
raise
himself
to
the
tenth
power
because
he
had
an
instinct
for
raising
himself
one
way
and
another
if
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
did
not
appear
at
the
parsonage
door
sober
dejected
and
in
a
proper
mood
for
repentance
william
went
after
him
plucked
him
up
from
somewhere
out
of
the
depths
and
proceeded
at
once
to
transplant
him
again
in
the
right
garden
in
all
the
years
of
his
ministry
i
never
knew
him
to
lose
hope
in
his
annuals
he
was
always
expecting
them
to
become
evergreens
of
glory
in
dealing
with
them
he
had
a
patience
a
little
like
the
patience
of
god
never
reproaching
them
or
threatening
them
with
the
time
limits
of
salvation
in
this
world
no
man
ever
had
a
sublimer
skill
in
dealing
with
the
barren
elements
in
human
nature
years
after
this
time
john
stark
became
congressman
from
his
district
and
william
died
in
the
belief
that
he
also
became
a
total
abstainer
he
probably
was
at
the
moment
he
told
him
so
but
having
studied
the
nature
of
spiritual
annuals
i
may
be
pardoned
my
doubts
however
he
will
have
his
nursery
place
in
heaven
if
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
furnish
congenial
employment
to
saints
like
william
i
have
often
wondered
what
would
have
happened
if
the
prodigal
son
had
been
a
daughter
would
the
father
have
hurried
out
to
meet
her
put
a
ring
on
her
finger
and
killed
the
fatted
calf
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
if
she
would
ever
have
come
home
at
all
and
if
she
had
come
the
best
he
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
say
go
and
sin
no
more
but
go
you
understand
and
all
over
the
world
you
can
see
them
these
frailer
prodigals
hurrying
away
to
the
lost
places
in
a
rotting
cabin
in
an
old
field
five
miles
from
redwine
lived
one
of
them
once
a
week
she
walked
fourteen
miles
to
the
nearest
large
town
to
get
plain
sewing
and
with
this
she
supported
herself
and
child
the
field
was
her
desert
for
eight
years
no
respectable
woman
had
crossed
it
or
spoken
to
her
till
the
day
william
and
i
and
the
horse
arrived
at
her
door
she
stood
framed
in
it
a
gaunt
figure
hardened
and
browned
and
roughened
out
of
all
resemblance
to
the
softness
of
her
sex
her
clothes
were
rags
and
her
eyes
like
hot
dammed
fires
in
her
withered
face
william
sprang
out
of
the
buggy
raised
his
hat
and
extended
his
hand
my
wife
and
i
have
come
to
take
dinner
with
you
he
said
not
with
me
oh
not
with
sech
as
me
she
murmured
vaguely
then
seeing
me
descend
also
she
ran
forward
to
meet
me
softly
crying
we
stayed
to
dinner
a
poor
meal
of
corn
hoecake
fried
bacon
and
sorghum
spread
upon
a
pine
table
without
a
cloth
but
of
all
the
food
i
ever
tasted
that
seemed
to
me
the
most
nearly
sanctified
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
persuaded
the
lost
mary
to
sit
down
and
partake
of
it
with
us
she
was
for
standing
behind
our
chairs
and
serving
us
after
that
she
sat
a
tragic
figure
through
every
service
at
redwine
even
creeping
forward
humbly
to
the
communion
she
was
not
received
however
in
any
of
the
homes
of
the
people
she
might
go
in
peace
whatever
peace
her
loneliness
afforded
that
the
scriptures
might
be
fulfilled
and
that
was
all
they
would
have
none
of
her
this
was
not
so
bad
as
it
seemed
she
was
free
indeed
having
no
reputation
to
win
or
lose
she
could
set
herself
to
the
simple
business
of
being
good
and
she
did
the
time
came
when
the
field
changed
into
a
garden
and
the
cabin
whitened
and
reddened
beneath
a
mass
of
blooms
but
there
was
one
man
whom
william
could
never
lead
when
hope
fell
forlorn
and
the
way
seemed
suddenly
rough
and
dark
that
was
himself
this
is
why
i
can
not
get
over
grieving
about
him
wherever
he
is
nothing
that
comes
to
him
of
light
now
can
lighten
those
other
days
far
down
the
years
when
he
lost
his
way
and
had
no
one
to
preach
to
him
nor
lead
him
for
the
one
tragedy
that
marked
the
course
of
our
lives
in
the
itinerancy
was
not
the
poverty
and
hardships
through
which
we
passed
it
was
the
periodic
backsliding
of
william
this
is
a
pathetic
secret
that
i
never
mentioned
during
his
lifetime
i
did
not
even
know
for
many
years
that
all
methodist
preachers
who
are
not
hypocrites
have
these
recurrent
before
the
lord
when
they
become
sorry
penguin
saints
with
nerves
it
grows
out
of
nature
protest
against
the
stretched
spiritual
perpendicularity
with
which
they
live
never
relaxing
their
prayer
tension
on
heaven
rarely
taking
any
normal
diversion
losing
their
life
purchase
upon
the
objective
through
too
much
subjective
thinking
ministers
of
other
denominations
are
probably
not
so
often
the
victims
of
this
reaction
the
symptoms
of
such
attacks
in
william
became
as
familiar
to
me
as
those
of
measles
or
they
were
most
apt
to
occur
after
what
may
be
called
long
spiritual
exposures
a
series
of
revivals
for
example
he
was
taken
with
the
first
one
i
remember
during
a
six
weeks
protracted
meeting
at
one
of
his
churches
on
the
first
circuit
we
were
spending
the
night
with
a
family
in
the
usual
log
cabin
we
occupied
the
company
bed
while
our
host
and
hostess
occupied
one
in
the
opposite
corner
by
this
time
i
had
become
resigned
to
this
hospitality
and
must
have
slept
soundly
but
some
time
after
midnight
i
was
awakened
by
the
deep
groans
of
my
husband
instantly
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
through
the
window
i
saw
his
face
white
and
ghastly
and
covered
with
sweat
as
if
he
were
in
mortal
pain
his
eyes
were
yawning
at
the
dark
with
no
real
light
in
them
and
his
mouth
was
drawn
down
into
jeremiah
lines
of
woe
that
are
indescribable
william
william
i
cried
aloud
what
is
the
matter
hush
mary
in
a
tragic
whisper
do
awaken
the
pratts
i
have
lost
the
witness
of
the
spirit
i
must
close
the
meeting
tomorrow
just
as
the
people
are
beginning
to
be
interested
but
it
would
be
blasphemy
to
go
on
preaching
feeling
as
i
do
how
do
you
feel
i
whispered
thoroughly
terrified
as
if
god
had
forsaken
me
i
had
been
in
it
long
enough
to
know
that
the
witness
of
the
spirit
is
the
hero
of
the
methodist
itinerancy
that
a
preacher
without
it
is
as
sounding
brass
and
a
tinkling
cymbal
that
he
is
in
a
rôle
of
a
great
play
which
has
been
rejected
by
the
star
i
wiped
the
mourning
dew
from
william
brow
laid
my
face
against
his
and
wept
in
silent
sympathy
i
saw
something
worse
than
disgrace
staring
us
in
the
face
william
deprived
of
his
definition
william
just
a
man
like
other
men
i
had
come
of
a
family
who
supported
the
church
and
sustained
a
polite
it
somewhat
distant
relation
to
heaven
religion
was
our
relief
like
the
sabbath
day
but
it
was
never
our
state
of
being
and
i
was
blandly
of
the
earth
earthly
but
i
suddenly
discovered
that
the
chief
fascination
of
william
for
me
was
that
he
was
not
of
the
earth
earthly
that
his
dust
was
distressed
and
stirred
by
strange
spiritual
instincts
very
different
from
anything
i
had
ever
known
and
probably
nothing
was
further
from
the
intention
of
providence
when
i
was
created
than
that
i
should
become
such
a
wife
but
i
had
one
enlightening
qualification
for
the
position
i
loved
william
i
was
called
to
that
as
he
had
been
called
to
the
ministry
and
now
as
i
laid
my
face
against
his
as
the
rose
lies
above
the
coffin
lid
i
was
concerned
only
for
william
peace
william
i
challenged
have
you
been
doing
wrong
something
really
and
truly
wicked
i
must
have
he
replied
with
egregious
sincerity
but
i
thought
i
had
been
observing
all
my
obligations
with
particular
care
then
it
all
right
i
said
god
would
not
trifle
with
you
about
the
witness
of
his
spirit
especially
at
such
a
time
as
this
it
was
not
often
that
i
showed
such
boundless
confidence
in
the
ways
and
i
was
indeed
far
from
feeling
as
familiar
with
them
as
i
pretended
but
the
affectation
comforted
him
and
certainly
it
was
no
injury
to
the
maker
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
william
fell
asleep
at
once
and
awakened
in
the
proper
frame
of
mind
next
morning
many
times
afterward
he
experienced
the
same
catastrophe
and
these
have
been
the
only
occasions
in
my
life
when
i
have
put
on
the
whole
armor
of
god
so
that
i
might
go
forth
properly
to
battle
with
the
powers
and
principalities
of
william
darkness
i
used
to
wonder
a
great
deal
in
those
days
about
the
witness
of
the
spirit
before
my
marriage
i
had
heard
little
of
it
i
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
but
i
never
prayed
for
it
myself
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
what
william
called
the
witness
of
the
spirit
might
be
the
shoulder
tap
of
his
own
spirit
approving
him
now
and
then
but
then
came
the
deeper
question
how
did
william
come
by
his
own
spirit
that
part
of
him
which
was
neither
flesh
nor
bone
nor
blood
but
which
had
the
power
to
make
him
sit
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
pray
and
to
make
him
fast
maybe
all
the
next
day
at
last
i
reached
a
comforting
conclusion
that
is
one
peculiarity
of
the
human
he
never
rests
upon
any
other
kind
of
conclusion
what
he
thinks
may
be
so
but
if
it
is
not
comforting
he
thinks
further
on
into
the
daybreak
of
eternity
till
he
gets
something
better
more
satisfactory
for
his
needs
this
is
why
we
shall
always
keep
on
finding
god
there
is
something
lacking
in
us
to
which
god
only
answers
the
conclusion
i
came
to
was
this
that
we
are
not
all
called
to
do
the
same
things
that
william
was
called
to
preach
and
pray
and
the
witness
of
his
spirit
approved
when
he
did
it
right
and
i
was
called
to
look
after
william
to
see
that
he
did
not
pray
too
much
or
preach
too
long
and
i
always
had
that
sweet
inward
glow
which
he
called
his
witness
when
i
attended
most
carefully
to
his
needs
it
may
be
a
narrow
way
to
look
at
it
but
you
could
live
with
william
in
any
peace
of
mind
without
this
witness
of
the
spirit
it
would
have
made
him
unhappy
to
live
with
a
person
who
could
claim
it
and
i
had
mine
these
thirty
years
without
having
to
pray
or
to
fast
to
get
it
a
tender
eye
in
me
that
regarded
him
and
a
heart
that
prayed
for
him
chapter
vi
william
enters
his
worldly
mind
this
is
the
wonderful
thing
about
the
pure
in
heart
they
do
see
god
and
that
was
william
distinction
in
spite
of
his
own
faults
and
of
ethical
errors
in
some
of
his
preaching
he
outstripped
all
these
and
did
actually
see
god
and
it
made
him
different
from
other
men
who
however
wise
do
not
see
god
on
this
account
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
fumbled
more
souls
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
some
of
the
most
popular
tabernacle
preachers
of
modern
times
nevertheless
william
had
his
worldly
mind
there
was
an
ancient
antaeus
in
him
whose
heel
occasionally
touched
the
strengthening
earth
and
he
was
as
unconscious
of
it
as
a
baby
is
of
its
expression
but
once
he
entered
his
worldly
mind
he
became
as
naïvely
unscrupulous
as
any
other
man
of
the
world
never
in
all
the
years
we
lived
together
did
he
repent
of
these
particular
deeds
done
in
the
body
he
could
be
brought
to
the
very
sackcloth
and
ashes
for
a
supposititious
sin
that
he
had
not
really
committed
but
no
man
could
make
him
repent
of
a
horse
trade
and
i
never
knew
but
one
who
had
the
best
of
him
in
one
in
common
with
all
circuit
riders
he
had
a
passion
for
horses
and
a
knowledge
of
them
that
would
have
made
his
fortune
on
the
race
track
this
brings
me
to
relate
an
incident
which
will
serve
to
indicate
the
shrewdness
and
unscrupulousness
of
william
once
he
took
the
spiritual
bit
in
his
teeth
we
were
on
the
beaverdam
circuit
and
he
had
bought
a
new
horse
a
horse
gifted
with
ungodly
speed
in
the
legs
and
a
mettlesome
temperament
on
a
certain
saturday
after
services
at
beaverdam
church
we
were
returning
home
in
a
light
buggy
drawn
by
the
big
rawboned
bay
when
we
came
to
a
long
stretch
of
good
road
william
tightened
the
reins
took
on
a
scandalous
expression
of
coliseum
delight
and
let
the
horse
out
instantly
the
thin
flanks
of
the
creature
tautened
he
laid
his
tail
over
the
dashboard
stretched
his
neck
flattened
his
ears
and
settled
himself
close
to
the
ground
in
action
that
showed
sinful
training
william
expression
developed
into
one
of
ecstasy
that
was
far
from
spiritual
and
i
had
much
ado
to
keep
my
hat
on
presently
we
heard
the
clatter
of
another
horse
feet
behind
us
and
the
next
moment
the
bay
was
neck
and
neck
with
charlie
weaver
black
mare
charlie
was
one
of
the
younger
goats
in
the
beaverdam
congregation
whose
chief
distinction
was
that
he
was
an
outbreaking
sinner
and
owned
the
fastest
horse
in
the
county
instantly
william
whole
nature
changed
he
was
no
more
a
minister
than
the
florid
young
man
in
the
buggy
that
was
whirling
giddily
beside
us
he
tightened
his
reins
and
touched
the
bay
with
his
whip
the
effect
was
miraculous
the
horse
leaped
forward
in
a
splendid
burst
of
speed
the
mare
showed
signs
of
irritation
and
broke
her
gait
and
the
two
jockeys
exchanged
challenging
glances
at
that
moment
we
rounded
a
curve
in
the
road
and
in
the
hot
dust
ahead
there
came
to
view
a
heavy
rockaway
drawn
slowly
by
a
pair
of
sunburned
oh
william
i
gasped
do
stop
that
is
the
brock
carriage
and
this
is
a
horse
race
brother
brock
was
a
rich
methodist
steward
who
not
only
owned
most
of
the
property
in
beaverdam
neighborhood
but
the
church
as
well
he
was
a
man
who
gave
you
the
impression
that
his
immortal
soul
had
cat
whiskers
he
fattened
his
tyrannical
faculties
upon
the
meekness
of
the
preacher
and
the
helplessness
of
a
congregation
largely
dependent
upon
him
to
pay
the
pastor
salary
and
the
church
assessments
any
preacher
who
offended
him
was
destined
to
be
deprived
of
his
subscriptions
knowing
this
i
took
an
anxious
economical
view
of
the
old
rockaway
heaving
forward
in
the
road
ahead
and
vainly
implored
william
to
slacken
his
speed
to
a
moral
ministerial
gait
in
another
moment
it
was
over
the
mare
crashed
into
the
rockaway
on
one
side
and
the
bay
shattered
the
swingletree
on
the
other
with
the
forewheel
of
our
buggy
the
old
plunged
feebly
then
lowered
their
heads
in
native
dejection
while
the
brocks
shrieked
root
and
branch
never
have
i
seen
such
a
look
of
feline
ferocity
upon
the
human
countenance
as
when
brother
brock
scrambled
down
from
his
seat
into
the
road
and
with
his
eyes
added
william
asbury
thompson
preacher
to
charles
jason
weaver
loafer
drunkard
and
horse
racer
and
placed
the
sum
of
them
on
the
blackboard
of
his
outer
darkness
i
sat
in
the
buggy
holding
the
reins
over
the
trembling
bay
while
william
descended
and
with
great
dignity
tied
up
the
disabled
swingletree
there
was
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
moral
repentance
in
his
manner
although
he
expressed
a
polite
regret
at
the
accident
when
brother
brock
resumed
his
place
on
the
driver
seat
and
sister
brock
had
ascended
to
hers
with
the
cacklings
of
a
hen
who
had
been
rudely
snatched
from
her
nest
and
all
the
and
little
brocks
were
safely
bestowed
beside
her
we
drove
on
at
a
funeral
pace
behind
them
the
bay
was
grossly
insulted
but
it
was
the
only
mark
of
humility
left
within
our
reach
three
days
later
the
presiding
elder
appeared
at
the
parsonage
door
he
was
a
big
man
riding
a
handsome
gray
horse
and
wearing
a
look
of
executive
severity
i
trembled
with
apprehension
for
we
had
heard
of
course
that
brother
brock
had
written
to
him
preferring
charges
against
william
for
horse
racing
but
now
i
had
an
astonishing
and
unexpected
view
of
william
character
his
worldly
mood
was
still
upon
him
his
antaeus
heel
still
upon
the
earth
he
hurried
out
to
meet
doctor
betterled
the
elder
and
having
thrown
the
saddlebags
of
his
guest
across
his
shoulder
stood
apparently
transfixed
with
admiration
before
the
gray
horse
i
almost
be
willing
to
swap
my
bay
for
him
i
heard
him
say
let
see
the
bay
replied
doctor
betterled
guardedly
five
minutes
later
peeping
through
the
kitchen
window
i
saw
the
mettlesome
bay
standing
beside
the
gray
and
the
two
men
each
with
one
foot
planted
far
forward
after
the
manner
of
traders
facing
one
another
with
concert
eloquence
concerning
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
animals
presently
they
entered
the
house
together
doctor
betterled
evidently
in
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
and
william
wearing
his
chastened
look
late
in
the
afternoon
when
our
guest
rode
away
he
was
mounted
on
the
bay
but
he
had
not
mentioned
the
horse
race
of
the
previous
saturday
william
stood
the
genial
host
bareheaded
at
the
gate
till
the
back
was
turned
then
he
came
into
the
house
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
open
window
and
fixed
his
eyes
with
a
deep
frown
above
them
upon
the
gray
horse
asleep
in
his
dotage
under
the
apple
tree
in
the
barnyard
that
horse
has
three
windgalls
he
is
swinneyed
in
both
shoulders
and
i
think
he
has
a
gravel
in
one
of
his
forefeet
he
remarked
in
a
tone
of
deep
dejection
i
laughed
and
felt
more
nearly
kin
to
him
morally
than
i
had
ever
felt
before
there
was
a
shrewdness
in
the
way
he
involved
and
disposed
of
the
presiding
elder
that
was
wittily
familiar
to
me
and
all
the
more
diverting
because
william
never
suspected
the
machiavellian
character
of
his
conduct
he
kept
his
eye
on
god
as
usual
letting
not
his
soul
right
hand
know
what
his
left
one
was
doing
but
going
back
to
brother
brock
and
the
subject
of
methodist
stewards
in
general
the
preacher
soon
discovers
that
the
rich
ones
are
the
most
obstreperous
and
besides
the
good
ones
the
rich
obstreperous
ones
are
divided
into
two
classes
the
first
class
consists
of
those
who
threaten
to
resign
if
everything
is
not
done
according
to
their
desires
which
they
hide
and
compel
you
to
find
out
the
best
way
you
can
occasionally
a
preacher
gets
into
a
community
where
everybody
in
the
church
from
the
janitor
to
the
steward
and
treasurer
has
this
mania
for
threatening
to
resign
i
shall
never
forget
william
first
experience
with
such
a
church
it
was
in
a
little
village
where
human
interest
consisted
in
everybody
hating
suspecting
or
despising
everyone
else
he
went
about
like
a
damned
soul
trying
to
restore
peace
and
brotherly
love
but
they
would
have
none
of
either
each
steward
approached
him
privately
and
tendered
his
resignation
giving
reasons
that
reflected
upon
the
character
of
some
other
steward
then
the
organist
tendered
her
resignation
because
the
superintendent
had
reflected
upon
her
playing
and
she
retaliated
by
reflecting
upon
his
unmarried
morals
when
the
superintendent
heard
of
her
complaint
and
withdrawal
he
at
once
sent
in
his
resignation
because
he
did
not
wish
to
cause
contention
in
the
church
william
afterward
discovered
that
they
treated
every
new
preacher
the
same
way
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
damage
each
other
as
much
as
possible
and
to
try
his
faith
to
the
limit
but
the
delightful
thing
about
william
was
that
where
his
patience
and
faith
gave
out
his
natural
human
blood
began
to
boil
and
when
that
started
he
could
preach
some
of
the
finest
fiercest
most
truthful
gospel
i
have
ever
heard
from
any
preacher
so
it
happened
in
this
church
when
he
was
in
certain
spiritual
or
to
be
more
precise
unspiritual
moods
he
refused
to
shave
but
wore
the
stubble
on
his
chin
either
by
way
of
mourning
or
defiance
as
the
case
might
be
on
this
sabbath
he
presented
a
ferocious
chin
to
the
congregation
after
having
waited
patiently
for
all
of
the
resigners
to
take
their
respective
prominent
places
in
it
he
preached
a
short
sermon
with
the
air
of
a
plagued
unkempt
angel
then
he
took
up
the
resignations
and
read
them
out
exactly
as
he
read
the
church
letters
of
new
members
accepting
each
one
and
giving
the
reasons
why
it
was
the
most
sensational
service
ever
held
in
that
church
in
the
first
place
to
accept
their
resignations
was
an
unprecedented
proceeding
and
the
last
thing
they
had
expected
him
to
do
the
custom
had
been
for
the
preacher
to
persuade
them
to
keep
their
offices
which
they
had
done
from
year
to
year
with
an
air
of
proud
reluctance
but
the
sensation
was
when
he
stated
literally
what
each
had
said
of
the
other
calling
no
names
of
course
and
saying
that
he
was
glad
that
these
sinners
had
had
the
humility
to
give
up
positions
of
trust
and
honor
in
the
church
which
they
were
evidently
unfit
to
fill
he
hoped
before
the
end
of
the
year
they
would
be
restored
spiritually
and
worthy
to
perform
the
services
they
had
formerly
performed
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
appoint
a
committee
of
sinners
to
attend
to
the
stewards
duties
until
these
should
be
reclaimed
from
their
backslidden
state
he
named
half
a
dozen
young
men
who
roosted
on
the
back
benches
after
the
manner
of
happy
young
lost
souls
and
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
astonishment
or
mischief
that
led
them
to
accept
with
such
alacrity
the
obligations
imposed
upon
them
but
william
has
always
claimed
since
that
they
were
the
most
active
and
effective
stewards
he
ever
had
that
it
was
the
first
year
he
had
ever
received
his
salary
in
full
and
the
congregation
was
thoroughly
cured
of
the
resignation
habit
the
second
class
of
obstreperous
stewards
is
easier
to
manage
the
quality
of
their
perversity
is
exactly
that
of
the
mule
william
never
had
to
move
a
church
get
a
new
roof
on
one
or
an
organ
for
it
or
even
a
communion
table
that
some
steward
did
not
lie
back
in
the
traces
back
his
official
ears
and
begin
to
balk
and
kick
mule
fashion
often
they
were
good
men
in
every
other
particular
but
they
were
simply
queer
reversions
to
type
which
indicates
that
at
one
time
not
so
far
back
in
the
history
of
evolution
all
men
were
mules
the
only
way
to
manage
them
is
to
wait
till
they
change
their
minds
just
as
the
driver
must
wait
upon
his
stubborn
donkey
for
you
can
never
move
one
by
reason
or
by
threats
he
would
die
and
go
to
the
wrong
place
rather
than
give
up
his
point
this
is
why
you
will
see
some
churches
going
to
rack
antiquated
and
out
of
touch
with
the
life
about
them
look
inside
and
you
will
find
some
old
mule
steward
stalled
in
the
amen
corner
with
his
ears
laid
back
at
the
pulpit
or
at
the
other
stewards
i
pass
without
giving
details
over
several
years
they
were
much
like
these
first
ones
i
soon
learned
however
that
life
in
the
methodist
church
was
all
uphill
or
downhill
at
a
smart
spiritual
canter
in
these
days
it
is
nearly
as
easy
to
be
a
methodist
as
it
is
to
be
an
episcopalian
one
rarely
sees
now
the
hallelujah
end
of
a
human
emotion
in
a
methodist
church
recently
when
an
saint
gave
way
and
scandalized
the
preacher
by
shouting
in
one
of
our
fashionable
city
churches
the
stewards
took
her
out
put
her
in
an
ambulance
and
sent
her
to
the
hospital
and
i
am
not
saying
that
the
dear
old
soul
need
a
few
drops
of
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
but
if
every
man
who
shouts
at
a
political
rally
were
sent
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
the
real
sick
would
be
obliged
to
move
out
to
give
them
room
as
for
me
i
contend
that
a
little
shouting
is
good
for
the
soul
it
is
the
human
hysteria
of
a
very
high
form
of
happiness
more
edifying
to
unhappy
sinners
than
the
refrigerated
manners
of
some
modern
saints
anyhow
i
say
there
were
no
level
grounds
in
methodist
experience
in
william
and
my
early
days
in
the
itinerancy
no
matter
how
young
or
old
or
respectable
they
might
be
those
received
into
membership
were
expected
to
show
signs
of
awful
conviction
for
sin
to
repent
definitely
preferably
in
solemn
abasement
at
the
church
altar
and
to
experience
a
conversion
there
were
no
such
things
as
we
see
now
boys
and
girls
simply
graduating
into
church
membership
from
the
senior
or
junior
class
i
am
not
saying
it
is
wrong
you
understand
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
much
better
for
the
church
if
it
did
more
spiritual
hospital
work
among
the
kind
of
people
who
are
too
bad
even
to
go
to
i
think
they
all
ought
to
be
taken
into
the
church
and
kept
there
till
they
get
well
spiritually
and
decent
morally
then
they
might
be
discharged
as
other
cured
people
are
to
go
back
into
the
world
to
do
the
world
work
properly
instead
of
improperly
as
it
is
one
trouble
with
all
the
churches
is
that
they
have
too
many
incurable
saints
in
them
men
and
women
who
pray
too
much
and
do
too
little
who
can
not
forget
their
own
selfish
salvation
enough
to
look
after
other
people
without
feeling
their
own
spiritual
pulse
all
the
time
they
are
doing
it
of
late
i
sometimes
suspected
that
it
is
nearly
as
debilitating
to
stay
in
the
church
all
the
time
as
it
would
be
to
stay
in
a
hospital
all
the
time
but
i
am
telling
now
how
things
were
and
thirty
years
ago
after
conversion
an
honest
methodist
life
was
divided
into
two
parts
the
seasons
when
he
was
in
grace
and
the
seasons
when
he
was
out
of
it
naturally
the
preacher
had
his
hands
full
looking
after
such
members
instead
of
having
his
hands
full
as
he
does
now
attending
committee
meetings
and
mission
classes
and
what
not
for
the
ethical
uplifting
of
the
native
poor
and
the
foreign
heathen
for
if
old
brother
settles
of
raburn
gap
church
was
up
and
coming
resisting
temptation
and
growing
like
jonah
gourd
spiritually
apt
as
not
young
brother
jimmy
trotter
of
bee
creek
church
had
backslid
and
gone
on
a
spree
there
was
never
a
night
when
william
instinct
did
not
include
both
of
them
with
equal
anxiety
and
often
he
would
reach
back
into
past
circuits
for
some
especially
dear
sinner
and
remind
the
lord
to
have
mercy
on
him
also
while
he
was
at
his
mercies
he
could
forget
the
saints
he
had
known
easy
enough
but
he
clung
year
after
year
to
the
sinners
he
had
found
name
by
name
if
the
redeemed
really
do
wear
crowns
in
heaven
with
jewels
in
them
to
represent
the
souls
they
have
helped
to
save
i
know
william
will
not
look
very
handsome
there
will
be
no
flashing
diamonds
or
emeralds
in
it
but
he
will
have
it
set
with
very
common
stones
to
symbolize
the
kind
of
souls
that
were
most
dear
to
him
there
will
be
a
dull
jade
for
the
young
country
woman
that
he
brought
back
home
from
the
city
and
saved
from
a
life
of
sin
and
maybe
a
bit
of
red
glass
for
sammy
peters
the
young
man
with
whom
he
was
wont
to
go
through
such
orgies
of
repentance
on
account
of
sammy
many
scandalous
transgressions
and
he
will
have
a
piece
of
granite
beaten
down
into
fine
gold
for
the
old
man
who
repented
before
it
was
too
late
and
i
reckon
he
will
be
sitting
somewhere
upon
the
dimmer
outskirts
of
paradise
most
of
the
time
with
wings
holding
the
thing
in
his
hands
instead
of
wearing
it
on
his
head
and
he
will
be
recalling
those
for
whom
the
stones
stand
with
a
tender
homesickness
for
them
for
even
in
heaven
he
will
be
lonely
without
them
his
dear
straying
sheep
always
the
people
we
served
were
poor
and
of
course
we
were
a
trifle
poorer
the
circuit
rider
is
not
only
a
priest
to
his
people
but
he
is
a
good
deal
of
a
mendicant
besides
william
rarely
returned
from
an
appointment
or
from
visiting
among
his
flock
that
he
did
not
bring
with
him
some
largess
of
their
kindness
this
made
pastoral
visiting
an
amiable
form
of
foraging
and
had
its
effect
on
character
we
were
continually
struggling
against
the
beggar
instinct
that
is
dormant
in
every
hopelessly
poor
man
we
were
tempted
within
and
without
sometimes
we
could
not
live
on
the
salary
paid
neither
could
we
refuse
the
gifts
offered
without
giving
offense
if
it
was
winter
he
would
come
back
with
the
pockets
of
his
stuffed
with
sausage
or
there
would
be
a
tray
of
backbone
souse
and
spareribs
under
the
buggy
seat
if
it
was
summer
the
wide
back
would
be
filled
with
fruit
one
old
lady
on
the
raburn
gap
circuit
famous
for
her
stinginess
never
varied
her
gift
with
the
seasons
it
was
always
dried
peaches
with
the
skins
on
them
but
as
a
rule
we
received
the
very
best
they
had
to
give
and
with
a
fragrant
openheartedness
that
sweetens
memory
this
is
the
glory
of
the
itinerancy
if
the
preacher
sees
the
worst
of
the
people
knows
their
faults
and
weaknesses
better
than
any
other
man
he
also
knows
their
virtues
better
once
when
we
were
far
up
in
the
foothills
of
the
blue
ridge
mountains
where
the
people
had
no
money
at
all
except
that
which
they
received
for
a
few
loads
of
tanbark
and
with
which
they
paid
their
taxes
we
came
to
desperate
straits
now
it
so
happened
that
year
that
the
women
in
a
rich
city
church
sent
out
christmas
boxes
containing
clothing
and
other
necessities
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
receive
one
of
these
and
i
flourished
forth
in
singularly
fashionable
garments
for
a
season
while
william
made
a
splendid
appearance
in
the
dinner
suit
of
a
certain
rich
but
wicked
congressman
the
swaggering
cut
of
the
coat
however
gave
almost
a
sacrilegious
grace
to
his
gestures
in
the
pulpit
chapter
vii
the
little
itinerant
and
others
on
this
circuit
in
a
house
nearly
as
open
as
a
barn
on
a
freezing
winter
night
our
baby
was
born
the
gaunt
dark
room
the
roaring
fire
upon
the
wide
hearth
the
ugly
little
kettle
of
herb
tea
steaming
on
the
live
coals
and
the
old
mountain
midwife
bending
with
her
hideous
scroll
face
over
me
are
all
a
part
of
the
memory
of
an
immortal
pain
at
the
end
of
a
dreadful
day
she
had
turned
with
some
contempt
from
the
fine
lady
on
the
bed
who
could
not
give
birth
to
her
child
and
said
simply
as
if
with
the
saying
she
washed
her
hands
of
the
whole
matter
she
ai
doin
right
i
reckon
somethin
is
wrong
william
had
ridden
forth
in
the
driving
storm
of
snow
and
ice
for
the
doctor
who
lived
ten
miles
distant
across
the
mountain
and
then
the
hours
came
and
sat
around
the
awful
bed
and
would
not
pass
nor
let
even
midnight
come
now
and
again
the
old
scroll
face
peeped
down
at
me
with
an
expression
of
extreme
terror
the
firelight
made
a
red
mist
over
the
dark
walls
and
the
steam
of
the
herbs
filled
my
nostrils
with
a
sickening
odor
at
last
there
was
an
end
of
endurance
the
hours
lifted
their
leaden
wings
and
hurried
away
the
old
midwife
changed
to
a
butterfly
and
i
knew
no
more
till
the
dawn
and
the
snow
spread
a
pale
light
over
the
world
outside
within
the
fires
still
blazed
but
the
herb
kettle
was
gone
and
the
ring
of
ghosts
coals
lay
whitening
in
their
ashes
where
it
spouted
and
steamed
the
old
hag
sat
asleep
in
the
chimney
corner
with
her
hands
hanging
down
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
warped
mouth
gaping
wide
at
the
rafters
above
over
a
little
table
by
the
door
a
fine
white
tablecloth
was
spread
i
wondered
at
it
dimly
and
what
it
concealed
i
felt
william
shaggy
head
bowed
upon
the
bed
and
a
peace
in
my
body
akin
to
the
peace
of
death
laboriously
my
eyes
traveled
back
to
the
fine
white
cloth
over
the
table
i
knew
all
about
it
but
could
not
remember
only
nothing
in
the
world
mattered
to
me
but
that
whatever
it
was
under
the
cloth
on
the
table
presently
soft
as
a
shade
returns
it
came
to
me
and
i
knew
the
little
shape
barely
curving
the
cloth
was
my
baby
grief
was
an
emotion
i
had
not
the
strength
to
afford
i
closed
my
eyes
and
felt
tears
press
through
the
lids
and
then
a
gruff
voice
sounded
close
to
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
thank
god
opening
my
eyes
again
with
a
great
effort
and
looking
up
i
beheld
him
the
old
burly
country
doctor
bending
above
me
with
his
warm
fingers
on
my
wrist
but
now
a
great
emergency
confronted
me
my
guardian
angel
who
has
never
ceased
to
be
very
urged
me
to
meet
it
william
william
i
whispered
and
felt
his
kiss
answer
me
he
must
be
baptized
but
he
is
dead
my
darling
he
replied
not
really
dead
william
he
must
be
alive
somewhere
or
i
can
not
bear
it
and
i
can
not
have
him
going
where
he
will
be
unbaptized
so
it
was
done
the
doctor
the
old
woman
and
william
standing
around
the
little
bier
and
william
saying
the
holy
words
himself
and
there
high
up
on
the
mountain
under
the
very
eave
of
heaven
swinging
deep
in
his
brown
cradle
of
earth
the
mother
angels
will
find
him
the
little
itinerant
with
his
dust
properly
baptized
when
they
come
on
the
last
day
to
awaken
and
gather
up
those
very
least
babies
who
died
so
soon
they
will
not
understand
the
resurrection
call
when
they
hear
it
after
that
we
took
more
interest
in
the
children
they
seemed
real
to
us
and
nearer
whereas
before
they
had
simply
passed
in
and
out
before
us
like
little
irresponsible
figureheads
of
the
future
with
whom
some
other
preacher
would
contend
later
we
never
asked
why
it
was
that
they
were
invariably
the
first
to
come
to
the
altar
when
invitations
were
extended
to
sinners
during
revival
season
but
it
was
curious
the
way
the
innocent
little
things
invariably
hived
there
no
matter
how
awful
and
accusing
the
invitation
would
be
to
those
dead
in
trespasses
and
sins
who
felt
themselves
lost
and
undone
so
we
began
to
be
aware
of
the
children
as
of
strange
young
misguided
angels
in
our
midst
and
it
was
a
rigid
test
of
the
genuineness
of
william
character
that
they
loved
him
whenever
i
have
seen
a
particularly
good
person
whom
children
avoided
i
have
always
known
that
there
was
something
rancid
about
his
piety
something
cankered
in
his
faculties
they
are
not
higher
critics
children
are
not
but
they
are
infallible
natural
critics
this
brings
me
to
tell
of
some
of
william
in
dealing
with
them
we
were
on
a
mountain
circuit
the
parsonage
was
in
a
little
village
but
there
was
no
sunday
school
there
nor
in
any
of
his
churches
the
people
were
poor
and
listless
the
children
knew
nothing
of
happy
anticipations
and
as
is
so
often
the
case
with
the
very
poor
they
sustained
only
the
inevitable
natural
relations
to
their
elders
there
were
no
tender
intimacies
they
were
really
as
wild
as
young
rabbits
if
we
met
one
in
the
road
by
chance
and
he
did
not
take
literally
to
his
heels
we
could
see
him
running
in
his
spirit
we
discovered
that
none
of
them
had
ever
even
heard
of
santa
claus
although
most
of
them
confessed
to
a
reluctant
biblical
acquaintance
with
adam
and
eve
the
thought
of
little
children
passing
through
the
christmas
season
without
some
kind
of
confectionery
faith
in
the
old
saint
took
hold
of
william
bereaved
paternal
instinct
he
did
not
mind
their
being
in
the
cold
winter
weather
but
to
be
so
desolate
of
faith
as
never
to
have
hoped
even
in
santa
claus
moved
him
to
desperation
a
week
before
christmas
he
visited
more
than
a
score
of
families
and
carried
the
news
with
him
to
every
child
he
could
find
in
the
mountains
that
there
was
a
santa
claus
and
that
santa
had
discovered
them
and
would
surely
bring
something
to
them
if
they
hung
up
their
stockings
he
enlarged
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
financial
capacity
upon
the
generosity
of
the
coming
saint
but
when
you
have
never
had
anything
good
in
your
stocking
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
it
in
advance
so
the
children
received
his
confidences
with
apathy
and
silence
never
even
at
the
end
of
a
conference
year
have
i
seen
william
so
industrious
and
so
much
the
mendicant
he
persecuted
the
merchants
in
the
village
for
gifts
for
his
children
he
had
old
women
who
had
not
thought
a
frivolous
thought
in
fifty
years
teetering
over
dressing
doll
babies
he
shamed
the
stingiest
man
in
the
town
into
giving
him
a
flour
sack
full
of
the
most
candy
i
ever
saw
william
i
exclaimed
when
he
brought
home
this
last
trophy
you
will
kill
them
but
he
replied
for
one
little
hour
they
will
be
happy
and
the
next
time
i
tell
them
anything
though
it
should
be
compound
scriptures
they
will
believe
me
the
distribution
of
gifts
was
made
very
secretly
some
days
beforehand
we
climbed
mountain
roads
to
little
brown
cabins
in
all
directions
leaving
mysterious
bags
and
parcels
with
in
one
cabin
on
top
of
what
was
known
as
crow
mountain
we
found
a
very
handsome
healthy
boy
four
months
old
clad
in
a
stocking
leg
and
the
sleeve
of
an
old
coat
that
had
been
cunningly
cut
and
sewed
to
fit
him
as
close
as
a
squirrel
skin
in
another
place
william
discovered
a
boy
of
seven
who
declined
to
believe
or
even
to
hope
in
santa
clans
he
was
thin
with
sad
hungry
eyes
ragged
and
as
usual
he
had
no
animation
he
simply
could
not
summon
enough
energy
to
believe
in
the
incredible
i
shall
never
forget
this
child
face
the
sabbath
after
christmas
we
had
a
voluntary
sunday
school
on
our
hands
a
score
of
little
boy
and
girl
caterpillars
appeared
at
church
excited
mysteriously
curious
like
queer
young
creatures
who
have
experienced
a
miracle
they
entered
immediately
into
full
fellowship
with
william
they
loved
him
with
a
kind
of
stolidity
that
would
have
tried
the
nerves
of
some
people
they
were
prepared
to
believe
anything
he
said
to
the
uttermost
only
once
was
there
any
symptom
of
higher
criticism
this
was
a
certain
sabbath
morning
in
the
sunday
school
when
william
told
the
story
of
the
forty
and
two
children
who
were
devoured
by
two
she
bears
because
they
had
made
fun
of
a
man
i
do
believe
that
tale
was
the
astounding
irreverent
comment
it
proceeded
from
the
same
incipient
agnostic
who
could
not
believe
in
santa
clans
why
william
was
indiscreet
enough
to
ask
because
if
only
two
bears
had
eat
that
many
children
it
would
have
busted
wide
open
no
one
smiled
william
faced
five
little
boys
on
the
bench
before
him
showing
wide
unblinking
eyes
turned
up
in
coldly
rational
interrogative
stares
with
a
figuratively
bulging
in
the
retina
of
each
and
it
was
too
much
for
him
we
will
pass
on
to
the
next
verse
he
announced
leaving
the
mystified
but
in
stubborn
possession
of
his
convictions
sometimes
in
these
latter
years
when
things
went
hard
with
us
there
would
come
a
flash
of
memory
and
william
and
i
would
see
the
face
of
some
child
always
as
if
the
sun
was
shining
on
it
looking
at
us
believing
in
us
from
far
down
the
years
and
it
has
helped
often
more
than
the
recollection
of
older
wiser
saints
our
experience
was
that
the
faces
of
the
children
we
had
known
lasted
better
in
memory
than
those
of
older
people
and
they
always
look
right
as
if
god
had
just
made
them
it
was
always
nip
and
tuck
in
the
records
of
william
ministry
whether
he
would
perform
more
marriage
ceremonies
or
preach
more
funerals
some
years
the
weddings
would
have
it
then
again
the
dead
got
the
better
of
it
as
a
rule
the
poorer
the
people
we
served
the
more
weddings
we
helped
to
celebrate
and
if
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
them
did
not
live
happy
ever
after
at
least
they
lived
together
there
is
no
hour
of
the
day
or
night
that
william
has
not
sanctified
with
somebody
marriage
vows
once
about
two
in
the
morning
there
was
a
furious
rap
at
the
door
of
the
parsonage
william
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
window
overhead
and
beheld
a
young
farmer
standing
in
the
moonlight
holding
the
hand
of
his
sweetheart
who
was
looking
up
at
him
with
the
expression
that
a
white
rose
wears
in
a
storm
come
down
and
tie
us
parson
called
the
groom
you
ai
got
time
to
dress
they
air
after
us
william
slipped
on
his
longtailed
coat
over
his
pajamas
hurried
downstairs
and
married
them
there
in
the
moonlight
after
having
examined
the
license
the
young
man
handed
in
through
the
parlor
window
and
he
looked
well
enough
from
the
sill
up
but
from
the
sill
down
i
doubt
if
his
costume
would
have
passed
muster
fortunately
no
one
thought
of
divorces
in
those
days
women
stayed
with
their
husbands
at
the
sacrifice
of
and
everything
else
save
honor
and
they
were
better
women
more
respected
than
those
who
kick
up
so
much
divorce
dust
in
society
nowadays
part
of
their
dissatisfaction
comes
from
bad
temper
and
bad
training
and
a
good
deal
of
it
comes
from
getting
foolish
notions
out
of
books
about
the
way
husbands
do
or
do
not
love
their
wives
it
seems
they
ca
be
satisfied
how
they
do
it
or
how
they
do
do
it
but
back
there
william
and
i
never
had
any
biological
suspicions
about
the
nature
of
love
and
the
people
he
married
to
one
another
did
not
have
any
either
once
i
remember
a
bridegroom
who
blushingly
confessed
that
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
the
fee
usually
offered
the
preacher
but
i
pay
you
parson
he
whispered
as
he
swung
his
bride
up
behind
him
upon
his
horse
i
pay
as
soon
as
i
able
illustration
i
pay
you
parson
i
pay
as
soon
as
i
able
ten
years
passed
and
william
was
sent
back
to
the
same
circuit
one
day
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
an
appointment
he
met
a
man
and
woman
in
a
buggy
the
woman
had
a
baby
at
her
breast
and
the
bottom
of
the
buggy
looked
like
a
human
birdnest
it
was
so
full
of
young
children
hold
on
said
the
man
pulling
up
his
horse
ai
this
brother
thompson
yes
well
here
ten
dollars
i
owe
you
what
for
demanded
william
holding
back
from
the
extended
hand
with
the
fluttering
bill
in
it
you
do
remember
it
i
reckon
but
you
married
us
ten
years
ago
i
was
so
poor
at
the
time
i
could
pay
you
for
the
greatest
service
one
man
ever
done
another
we
ai
prospered
since
in
nothing
except
babies
or
i
be
handin
you
a
hundred
instead
of
ten
i
have
never
heard
a
man
compliment
his
wife
since
then
that
i
do
not
instinctively
compare
it
with
the
compliment
this
mountain
farmer
paid
his
wife
that
day
i
never
hear
the
love
of
a
man
for
his
wife
misnamed
by
the
new
disillusioned
thinkers
of
our
times
that
i
do
not
recall
the
charming
testimony
of
this
husband
against
the
injustice
and
indecency
of
their
views
chapter
viii
i
hold
the
stage
so
far
the
circuit
rider
has
been
the
hero
of
these
letters
but
in
this
one
his
wife
shall
be
the
heroine
behind
the
throne
at
least
for
scarcely
any
other
woman
looks
or
feels
less
like
one
in
the
open
the
methodist
ministry
is
singularly
devastating
in
some
ways
upon
the
women
who
are
connected
with
it
by
marriage
for
one
thing
it
tends
to
destroy
their
aesthetic
sensibilities
they
lack
very
often
the
good
taste
of
thrift
in
poverty
not
so
much
because
of
the
poverty
but
because
they
never
get
settled
long
enough
to
develop
the
instinct
and
house
pride
that
is
dormant
in
us
all
they
simply
make
a
shift
of
things
till
the
next
conference
meets
when
they
will
be
moved
to
another
parsonage
a
woman
has
not
the
heart
to
plant
annuals
much
less
perennials
under
such
circumstances
let
the
parsonage
aid
society
do
it
if
it
must
be
done
and
the
parsonage
aid
society
does
do
it
you
will
see
in
many
methodist
preachers
front
yards
roses
the
kind
that
thrive
without
attention
planted
always
by
the
president
of
the
parsonage
aid
society
and
it
may
be
there
will
be
a
syringa
bush
in
the
background
not
that
the
parsonage
aid
society
is
partial
to
this
flower
but
because
it
is
not
easily
killed
by
neglect
they
choose
the
hardiest
ugliest
known
shrubs
for
the
parsonage
yard
because
they
last
best
on
every
circuit
in
every
charge
you
will
find
the
parsonage
aid
society
a
band
of
faithful
fretted
good
housekeepers
who
worry
and
wrangle
over
furnishing
the
parsonage
as
they
worried
and
wrangled
when
they
were
little
girls
over
their
communistic
playhouses
the
effects
in
the
parsonage
are
not
harmonious
of
course
as
a
rule
every
piece
of
furniture
in
it
contradicts
every
other
piece
each
having
been
contributed
by
rival
women
or
rival
committees
in
the
society
and
this
has
its
deadening
effect
upon
the
preacher
wife
taste
else
she
must
go
mad
living
in
a
house
where
say
there
is
a
strip
of
worn
carpet
down
the
hall
bought
at
a
bargain
by
the
thrifty
aid
society
a
folding
bed
in
the
parlor
along
with
a
golden
oak
table
a
bookcase
four
different
kinds
of
chairs
a
calendar
on
the
wall
and
a
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
with
a
flowered
washbowl
and
pitcher
on
a
plain
deal
table
in
the
corner
confessing
that
after
all
it
is
not
a
parlor
but
the
presiding
elder
bedroom
when
he
comes
to
hold
quarterly
meeting
still
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
the
business
in
this
country
i
would
have
a
colossal
statue
raised
to
the
living
women
of
the
methodist
parsonage
aid
societies
but
the
worst
effect
of
the
itinerancy
upon
its
ministers
wives
is
the
evil
information
they
must
receive
in
it
about
other
people
if
i
had
to
select
the
woman
in
all
the
world
best
informed
about
the
faults
sins
and
weaknesses
of
mankind
i
should
not
choose
the
sophisticated
woman
of
the
world
but
i
should
point
without
hesitation
to
the
little
pale
methodist
preacher
wife
the
pallor
is
the
pallor
of
hardship
often
of
the
lack
of
the
right
kind
of
nourishment
but
the
stillness
is
not
the
result
of
inward
personal
calm
and
peace
it
is
the
face
of
a
woman
who
knows
all
about
everybody
she
meets
with
that
thin
little
smile
and
quiet
eye
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
preacher
wife
is
the
vat
for
receiving
all
the
circuit
scandal
actually
intended
for
her
husband
ears
the
most
conscienceless
gossips
in
this
world
are
to
be
found
always
among
the
members
of
any
and
every
church
they
are
the
scribes
and
pharisees
who
contribute
most
to
the
building
of
fine
houses
of
worship
they
give
most
to
its
causes
they
are
the
right
hands
of
all
the
preachers
from
their
youth
up
they
have
never
been
truthful
sinners
they
were
the
pale
pious
little
boys
and
girls
who
behaved
and
who
graduated
from
the
sunday
schools
long
ago
without
ever
being
converted
to
the
church
and
there
you
see
them
the
fat
firsts
in
this
world
who
shall
be
last
and
least
in
the
world
to
come
those
least
inclined
to
tattle
about
their
neighbors
i
found
were
poor
pathetic
sinners
with
damaged
reputations
who
could
not
afford
to
talk
about
others
they
belonged
humbly
to
the
church
but
never
figured
loudly
in
it
and
if
god
is
god
as
i
do
firmly
believe
in
spite
of
all
i
have
heard
to
the
contrary
there
will
be
something
doing
in
heaven
when
these
sinners
are
all
herded
in
they
will
wear
the
holy
seal
of
his
tender
forgiveness
through
all
eternity
and
get
most
of
the
high
offices
in
paradise
just
as
a
matter
of
simple
justice
what
i
have
suffered
morally
from
them
can
not
be
put
into
words
within
a
week
of
our
arrival
on
a
new
work
one
of
them
would
be
sure
to
call
there
was
sister
weekly
for
example
on
the
gourdville
circuit
and
the
parsonage
here
was
in
the
little
village
of
gourdville
william
was
out
making
his
first
pastoral
visits
when
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
i
untied
my
kitchen
apron
smoothed
my
hair
sighed
for
i
knew
from
past
experience
it
would
be
the
church
arch
gossip
and
opened
the
door
a
round
old
lady
tied
up
in
a
sanctified
black
widow
bonnet
stood
on
the
step
i
am
weekly
she
explained
and
i
reckon
you
are
sister
thompson
the
new
preacher
wife
both
my
sons
are
stewards
and
i
thought
i
come
over
and
get
acquainted
and
give
you
a
few
it
so
hard
for
a
stranger
in
a
strange
place
to
know
which
is
which
i
am
glad
to
see
you
wo
you
come
in
i
said
pleasantly
she
settled
herself
in
the
rocker
before
the
fire
in
our
front
room
looked
down
at
the
rug
and
exclaimed
my
ai
this
rug
greasy
our
last
pastor
wife
was
a
dreadful
careless
housekeeper
she
had
a
white
seamless
face
sad
prayerful
blue
eyes
too
large
for
the
sockets
a
little
piquant
nose
that
she
had
somehow
managed
to
bring
along
with
her
unchanged
from
a
frivolous
girlhood
and
a
quaint
old
hymnal
mouth
looking
up
from
the
rug
she
took
on
an
expression
of
pure
and
undefiled
piety
and
began
in
the
strident
cackling
tones
of
an
hen
your
husband
goin
to
have
an
awful
hard
time
here
sister
thompson
the
church
is
split
wide
open
about
the
organ
old
man
walker
wants
it
on
the
side
of
the
pulpit
and
my
sons
have
put
it
on
the
side
where
the
light
is
good
and
the
choir
can
see
the
music
better
it
ai
decent
the
way
walker
makes
himself
prominent
in
the
church
nohow
they
say
he
killed
a
man
in
virginia
before
he
came
here
i
might
as
well
tell
you
for
you
are
bound
to
hear
it
anyhow
my
sons
say
they
are
going
to
pull
out
and
go
to
the
presbyterian
church
if
walker
do
quit
carryin
on
so
about
the
organ
their
father
was
presbyterian
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
cropped
out
in
them
but
it
be
bad
for
our
church
if
they
do
they
pay
half
of
the
preacher
salary
and
walker
scarcely
pays
at
all
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
richard
brown
has
took
the
homestead
law
to
keep
from
paying
his
debts
now
maybe
he
drop
behind
in
his
subscription
too
he
was
a
right
smart
help
in
the
church
though
i
never
thought
much
of
him
morally
they
say
he
drinks
and
cusses
both
when
he
goes
off
to
augusta
and
it
a
plumb
shame
that
his
president
of
the
woman
foreign
missionary
society
she
all
right
now
i
reckon
but
folks
about
her
when
she
was
a
girl
she
paused
to
get
her
second
wind
folded
her
hands
as
if
in
prayer
turned
her
divine
old
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
and
continued
but
the
epworth
league
is
the
worst
i
always
had
my
doubts
about
it
wo
do
to
git
too
many
young
folks
together
in
a
bunch
i
do
care
how
religious
they
are
they
just
bust
up
and
turn
natural
if
you
git
too
many
of
together
that
what
happened
here
the
epworth
league
kept
on
flourishin
so
we
did
understand
it
it
met
every
saturday
night
as
prayerful
and
punctual
as
clocks
but
as
soon
as
the
old
folks
left
they
shet
the
doors
and
then
dance
like
sin
been
doing
it
for
months
before
anybody
found
out
oh
i
tell
you
everything
is
on
the
downward
road
in
this
church
and
your
husband
is
going
to
have
his
hands
full
even
if
he
do
starve
to
death
every
preacher
wife
is
the
victim
of
such
women
if
she
is
supernaturally
wise
she
does
not
handicap
her
husband
by
repeating
their
gossip
to
him
personally
i
prayed
more
earnestly
to
be
delivered
from
this
particular
temptation
than
from
any
other
but
never
once
was
the
lord
able
to
do
it
sooner
or
later
i
invariably
told
william
every
word
of
scandal
i
heard
he
never
served
but
one
church
where
the
people
in
it
did
not
talk
about
one
another
i
will
call
the
place
celestial
bells
although
that
is
not
the
real
name
of
it
the
congregation
was
a
small
one
composed
of
folk
they
all
danced
a
little
went
to
the
theater
often
wore
golden
ornaments
and
otherwise
perjured
themselves
in
the
light
of
the
membership
vows
in
our
church
discipline
what
i
wonder
is
will
the
good
patient
god
who
knows
that
since
the
days
of
david
we
have
had
dancing
dust
in
us
who
has
himself
endowed
us
so
abundantly
with
the
dramatic
instinct
who
even
hid
his
gold
about
with
which
we
bedeck
and
enrich
ourselves
will
he
i
say
damn
those
honest
people
most
or
will
he
take
it
out
of
the
religious
topknots
of
the
church
who
tempted
them
with
these
rules
in
the
discipline
poor
william
had
a
scandalous
time
at
that
place
readjusting
his
moral
focus
so
that
it
would
rest
upon
his
people
sister
c
and
sister
z
were
admirable
wives
and
mothers
he
had
never
had
more
intelligently
helpful
women
in
his
congregation
that
is
to
say
they
were
patiently
faithful
in
their
attendance
upon
its
services
they
professed
often
to
be
benefited
by
his
sermons
they
brought
up
their
children
in
a
new
kind
of
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
but
if
he
went
to
pay
them
a
pastoral
call
and
have
prayers
with
them
apt
as
not
he
would
find
that
they
had
gone
to
take
the
children
to
the
matinee
and
brother
a
and
brother
i
were
the
best
stewards
he
ever
had
but
they
would
do
anything
from
wearing
a
tuxedo
to
going
to
a
circus
i
can
never
forget
brother
i
prayers
although
he
was
modest
and
retiring
to
the
point
of
shyness
he
was
one
of
the
few
members
in
the
church
at
celestial
bells
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
lead
in
prayer
this
was
frequently
william
experience
oftener
than
not
the
brother
who
could
slap
him
on
the
back
or
sing
a
bass
in
the
choir
that
made
the
chandeliers
rattle
would
turn
pale
and
fall
into
a
panic
if
he
was
called
on
to
pray
somehow
one
got
the
notion
that
he
felt
his
voice
would
not
carry
in
that
direction
but
brother
i
could
open
his
heart
at
once
in
prayer
and
do
it
so
naturally
every
one
of
us
felt
that
we
were
ourselves
uttering
the
same
prayer
he
never
ornamented
his
petitions
with
any
high
sounding
phrases
he
was
not
so
much
a
man
carrying
on
in
a
loud
voice
before
his
maker
as
he
was
a
little
boy
with
a
sore
toe
and
troubles
appertaining
to
his
littleness
and
inexperience
and
faults
and
forgetfulness
all
of
which
he
let
out
with
the
emotion
of
a
child
to
his
father
and
with
such
reality
of
detail
that
the
whole
congregation
accompanied
him
with
his
lamentations
and
regrets
whenever
i
lifted
my
head
after
one
of
brother
i
prayers
i
felt
better
like
a
child
who
has
taken
some
great
elder
person
into
its
confidence
while
i
am
on
this
subject
of
prayer
i
must
not
forget
an
incident
connected
with
brother
a
he
was
the
most
belligerent
looking
peaceful
man
i
ever
saw
his
brows
were
black
and
so
thick
they
amounted
to
whiskers
above
his
large
pale
blue
eyes
he
wore
a
military
moustache
of
the
same
color
and
preferred
to
talk
through
his
teeth
and
aside
from
being
very
prosperous
and
a
good
friend
his
distinction
was
that
he
knew
how
to
the
will
of
his
father
with
as
much
directness
and
dispatch
as
if
it
had
been
an
ordinary
business
proposition
if
william
wanted
the
church
moved
off
a
side
street
in
a
hollow
he
was
the
man
who
could
drag
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
set
it
on
a
hill
yoked
up
of
course
with
as
many
other
stewards
as
he
could
get
if
there
was
anything
to
be
done
he
could
do
it
and
in
the
right
spirit
but
he
was
one
of
god
dumb
saints
he
had
faith
and
he
had
works
but
he
could
pray
that
is
not
in
public
this
led
to
the
incident
to
which
i
have
already
referred
we
had
just
come
to
celestial
bells
and
seeing
brother
a
so
active
like
a
pillar
of
cloud
and
fire
in
the
church
we
did
not
suspect
his
muteness
william
was
closing
his
first
sunday
night
service
the
congregation
was
large
and
in
the
front
midst
of
it
sat
brother
a
immediately
behind
him
sat
brother
b
a
fluent
and
enthusiastic
steward
i
was
in
the
amen
corner
as
usual
because
it
is
only
from
this
vantage
ground
that
a
preacher
wife
can
keep
her
eye
properly
upon
his
congregation
and
be
able
to
estimate
the
causes
and
effects
of
his
discourse
i
have
sometimes
suspected
indeed
that
better
saints
occupy
this
amen
corner
for
a
less
excusable
curiosity
about
the
doings
in
the
congregation
william
closed
the
looked
out
over
the
blur
of
faces
before
him
and
said
brother
a
will
lead
us
in
prayer
if
he
had
suddenly
struck
a
short
circuit
and
let
loose
a
flash
of
electricity
in
the
house
the
shock
would
not
have
been
more
perceptible
everybody
knew
that
brother
a
could
not
lead
in
prayer
except
william
who
was
already
on
his
knees
with
closed
eyes
and
the
patmos
look
on
his
blind
face
every
head
was
bowed
except
those
of
brother
a
and
brother
b
they
were
whispering
over
the
back
of
the
bench
that
separated
them
the
sweat
was
standing
out
on
brother
forehead
his
brows
bristled
with
horror
while
brother
b
smiled
calmly
at
him
go
on
b
you
know
i
ca
pray
in
public
i
heard
him
say
he
did
ask
me
he
called
on
you
retorted
brother
b
thus
they
had
it
back
and
forth
for
more
than
a
minute
then
william
groaned
which
added
the
one
touch
that
rendered
brother
a
frantic
casting
a
ferociously
damaging
look
at
brother
b
he
nudged
the
lady
sitting
beside
him
and
whispered
lead
this
prayer
madam
i
ca
and
she
led
it
in
a
sweet
high
treble
that
must
have
surprised
william
and
even
the
angels
in
heaven
if
they
were
expecting
to
hear
the
petition
in
the
ordinary
masculine
bass
which
is
usually
characteristic
of
such
petitions
but
i
was
going
to
tell
how
disconcerting
it
was
to
william
to
serve
people
who
were
apparently
religious
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
reconcile
this
kind
of
diphthong
living
with
his
notions
of
piety
at
least
their
sins
lay
heavily
on
his
conscience
one
sabbath
morning
in
june
he
entered
the
pulpit
in
a
sinai
mood
determined
to
read
the
church
rules
and
to
apply
them
severely
he
began
by
selecting
a
condemnatory
psalm
took
his
text
simply
as
a
threat
from
jeremiah
in
one
of
his
bad
moods
and
after
a
severe
hymn
and
a
mournful
rachel
prayer
he
arose
folded
his
spectacles
and
fixed
his
eyes
burningly
upon
the
innocent
faces
of
his
congregation
which
had
a
what
have
we
done
expression
on
them
that
would
have
moved
an
angel
to
impatience
brethren
and
sisters
he
said
after
a
frightful
spiritual
pause
it
is
my
duty
this
morning
to
call
you
back
out
of
the
far
country
into
which
you
have
gone
to
your
father
house
i
blame
myself
for
your
dreadful
condition
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
tell
you
of
your
faults
as
a
preacher
should
tell
his
people
when
he
sees
them
wandering
in
the
forbidden
paths
of
worldliness
and
sin
i
have
not
been
a
faithful
shepherd
to
you
and
doubtless
the
lord
will
lay
your
sins
upon
my
head
but
this
morning
i
am
resolved
to
do
my
duty
by
you
no
matter
what
it
costs
the
congregation
took
on
the
expression
of
a
child
about
to
be
laid
across
the
parent
knee
but
when
he
opened
the
discipline
and
proceeded
to
read
the
rules
following
each
with
solemn
almost
personal
applications
to
conditions
under
his
very
nose
in
his
own
church
their
countenances
underwent
a
lightning
change
of
almost
happy
relief
never
can
i
forget
the
naïve
sweetness
with
which
those
people
turned
up
their
untroubled
eyes
to
william
and
received
his
thundering
exhortations
they
seemed
proud
of
his
courage
for
indeed
he
nearly
broke
his
heart
condemning
them
and
at
the
same
time
they
seemed
to
be
bearing
with
him
as
they
would
bear
with
the
vagaries
of
a
good
and
loving
old
father
sister
c
and
sister
z
sat
near
the
front
surrounded
by
their
respective
cherubim
broods
looking
up
at
him
with
tender
humorous
eyes
the
children
indeed
felt
something
alien
to
peace
in
the
atmosphere
they
regarded
him
fearfully
then
turned
meek
inquisitive
faces
to
their
mothers
but
those
two
extraordinary
women
never
blinked
or
blushed
from
start
to
finish
although
they
were
deeply
dyed
with
all
the
guilt
william
mentioned
the
one
person
present
who
received
the
discourse
with
almost
vindictive
signs
of
indorsement
was
brother
billy
smithers
a
man
who
had
lived
an
exasperatingly
regular
life
in
the
church
for
more
than
forty
years
he
sent
up
amens
fervid
with
the
heat
of
his
furious
spirit
at
the
end
of
each
charge
and
condemnation
chapter
ix
william
and
the
feminine
soul
i
do
not
know
if
i
make
you
understand
that
all
this
time
the
years
were
passing
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
and
in
them
we
went
together
up
and
down
and
around
our
little
world
william
offering
his
salvation
without
any
wisdom
of
words
worth
mentioning
yet
with
a
wisdom
as
sweet
as
redolent
of
goodness
as
the
carnations
in
heaven
are
of
paradise
and
i
followed
after
him
holding
up
his
hands
often
with
my
own
eyes
blindfolded
to
the
spiritual
necessities
of
the
situation
praying
when
he
prayed
though
many
a
time
i
could
have
trusted
our
father
to
do
the
square
thing
without
so
much
of
the
soul
and
this
is
how
at
the
end
of
so
many
years
in
the
itinerancy
i
began
to
take
on
the
look
of
it
that
is
to
say
i
had
faded
and
although
i
still
wore
little
decorative
fragments
of
my
wedding
finery
my
clothes
in
general
had
the
peculiar
set
that
is
observable
in
the
garments
of
every
methodist
wife
at
this
stage
of
her
fidelity
to
the
cause
there
is
something
solemn
and
uncompromising
in
her
something
mournfully
beseeching
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
and
i
do
not
know
anything
in
nature
more
pathetically
honest
than
the
way
her
neck
comes
up
out
of
the
collar
and
says
search
me
all
this
is
most
noticeable
when
the
circuit
rider
has
brought
her
up
from
his
country
circuit
to
the
town
parsonage
and
the
town
church
where
there
is
such
a
thing
as
style
in
sleeves
and
headgear
i
should
say
in
this
connection
that
william
did
at
last
rise
that
much
in
the
church
he
occasionally
became
the
pastor
in
a
village
with
a
salary
of
at
most
five
hundred
dollars
the
wife
at
this
time
always
looks
like
a
poor
little
lady
rip
van
winkle
in
the
congregation
and
her
husband
invariably
makes
the
better
impression
because
all
those
years
while
she
was
wearying
and
fading
he
was
consciously
or
unconsciously
cultivating
his
powers
of
personality
his
ministerial
presence
and
even
the
full
rich
tones
of
his
preaching
voice
but
i
will
say
for
william
that
he
was
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
of
any
carnal
intentions
in
these
improvements
he
was
wedded
to
his
white
cravats
as
the
angels
are
to
their
wings
and
he
was
by
nature
so
fastidiously
neat
that
if
he
had
been
a
cat
instead
of
a
man
he
would
have
spent
much
of
his
time
licking
his
paws
and
washing
his
face
besides
like
all
preachers
wives
i
was
anxious
that
he
should
look
well
in
the
pulpit
and
therefore
ready
to
sacrifice
my
own
needs
that
he
might
buy
new
clothes
because
he
must
appear
so
publicly
every
sunday
especially
as
by
this
time
i
had
the
feeling
of
not
appearing
even
when
i
was
present
one
of
the
peculiar
experiences
of
a
preacher
wife
is
to
stand
in
the
background
at
the
end
of
every
sunday
morning
service
and
see
her
husband
lionized
by
the
congregation
another
thing
happened
as
we
went
on
far
more
important
than
the
casting
of
me
out
of
the
fashion
of
the
times
this
was
the
change
in
the
quality
of
spirituality
with
which
william
had
to
deal
in
his
more
cultivated
congregations
i
can
not
tell
exactly
where
we
made
the
transit
but
somewhere
in
the
latter
years
of
his
ministry
he
stepped
out
of
one
generation
into
another
where
the
ideals
of
the
christian
life
were
more
intelligent
but
less
heavenly
the
things
that
preachers
had
told
about
god
to
scare
the
people
forty
years
before
had
come
up
and
flowered
into
heresies
and
unbelief
in
their
children
william
actually
had
to
quit
preaching
about
jonah
and
the
whale
he
had
an
excellent
sermon
on
the
crucial
moment
of
jonah
repentance
with
which
in
the
early
part
of
his
ministry
he
often
awakened
the
nineveh
consciences
of
his
people
but
when
he
preached
the
same
sermon
twenty
years
later
in
a
suburban
town
the
young
people
laughed
for
the
first
time
he
came
in
contact
with
that
element
in
the
modern
church
that
is
afflicted
with
spiritual
invalidism
it
is
composed
of
women
for
the
most
part
who
hunger
and
thirst
after
a
kind
of
gruel
gospel
and
who
are
forever
wanting
to
consult
the
pastor
between
times
about
their
spiritual
symptoms
they
are
almost
without
exception
the
victims
of
the
same
epidemic
of
moral
inertia
and
emotional
heavings
they
do
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
being
sinners
and
personally
i
would
not
believe
they
had
souls
at
all
if
i
had
not
seen
them
develop
the
diabolical
soul
to
such
amazing
degrees
of
perversity
but
of
all
people
i
have
the
least
hope
of
their
redemption
because
they
are
too
smart
to
be
convicted
of
their
real
sins
back
upon
the
old
weatherbeaten
circuits
we
met
no
such
examples
of
mock
spirituality
the
men
and
women
there
had
too
little
sense
and
too
much
virtue
to
go
through
such
complicated
intellectual
processes
to
deceive
themselves
and
others
they
took
narrow
almost
persecuting
views
of
right
and
wrong
but
these
teething
saints
in
the
town
churches
had
a
too
broadminded
way
of
speculating
upon
their
very
narrow
moral
margins
and
too
few
steadfast
convictions
of
any
sort
the
women
were
the
worst
as
i
have
already
intimated
many
of
them
were
in
a
fluid
state
dissolved
by
their
own
minds
others
sustained
the
same
relation
to
their
souls
that
young
and
playful
kittens
do
to
their
tails
they
were
always
chasing
them
and
never
really
finding
them
but
the
most
dangerous
of
them
all
is
the
one
who
refuses
to
take
up
her
bed
and
walk
spiritually
and
who
wants
the
preacher
to
assist
her
at
every
step
there
is
something
infernal
about
a
woman
who
can
not
distinguish
between
her
sentimental
emotions
and
a
spiritual
ambition
this
is
why
when
we
hear
of
a
minister
who
has
disgraced
himself
with
some
female
member
of
his
flock
my
sympathies
are
all
with
the
preacher
i
know
exactly
what
has
happened
some
sad
lady
who
has
been
awakened
from
a
silent
cold
backslidden
state
by
his
sermons
goes
to
see
him
in
his
church
study
they
who
build
studies
for
their
preachers
in
the
back
part
of
the
church
surround
him
with
the
four
walls
of
moral
destruction
and
invite
it
for
him
the
place
for
a
minister
study
is
in
his
own
home
with
his
wife
passing
in
and
out
if
he
has
female
spiritual
invalids
calling
on
him
she
is
perfectly
innocent
in
that
she
has
not
considered
her
moral
responsibility
to
the
preacher
she
is
about
to
victimize
she
is
very
modest
really
and
truly
modest
he
is
a
little
on
his
guard
till
he
discovers
this
first
she
tells
him
that
she
is
unhappy
at
home
has
a
sacrilegious
husband
most
likely
i
have
never
known
one
who
spoke
well
of
her
husband
she
has
been
perishing
spiritually
for
years
in
this
brutal
atmosphere
and
she
dwells
upon
it
till
the
preacher
heart
is
wrung
with
compassion
for
what
this
delicate
nature
has
suffered
in
the
unhallowed
surroundings
of
her
home
but
now
she
goes
on
with
a
sweet
light
in
her
eyes
his
sermons
have
aroused
in
her
a
desire
to
overcome
such
difficulties
and
to
live
on
a
higher
plane
could
he
give
her
some
advice
he
can
he
is
so
full
of
real
honest
truthful
kindness
he
almost
wants
to
hold
her
hands
while
he
bestows
it
nothing
is
further
from
his
mind
than
evil
the
preacher
in
particular
must
think
no
evil
this
places
him
within
easy
reach
of
the
morbid
woman
who
can
do
a
good
deal
of
evil
before
she
thinks
it
after
a
few
visits
she
professes
a
very
real
growth
spiritually
but
she
hesitates
lowers
her
gentle
head
and
finally
confesses
that
she
is
troubled
with
temptations
she
shows
her
angelic
confidence
in
him
by
telling
them
and
he
is
deeply
moved
at
the
almost
childish
innocency
of
what
she
calls
her
temptations
no
honest
woman
could
possibly
regard
them
as
such
if
he
only
knew
it
but
he
does
know
it
he
sees
her
reduced
to
tears
over
her
transgressions
and
before
he
considers
what
he
is
about
he
has
kissed
the
dear
child
that
is
the
way
it
happens
nine
times
out
of
ten
a
good
man
damned
and
lost
by
some
frail
angel
of
his
church
a
minister
is
always
justified
in
suspecting
the
worst
of
a
pretty
woman
who
wants
to
consult
him
privately
about
her
soul
whether
she
has
sense
enough
to
suspect
herself
or
not
after
observing
william
very
carefully
for
thirty
years
i
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
wisest
preacher
knows
nothing
about
the
purely
feminine
soul
and
the
less
he
has
to
do
with
it
the
better
the
thing
whatever
it
is
is
so
intimately
connected
with
her
nervous
system
that
only
her
heavenly
father
can
locate
it
from
day
to
day
and
i
have
observed
that
the
really
good
women
are
never
guilty
of
the
sacrilege
of
showing
their
immortality
to
preachers
i
lived
with
william
for
thirty
years
and
had
more
than
my
share
of
spiritual
difficulties
but
i
would
have
as
soon
asked
him
how
to
cut
out
my
dress
as
what
to
do
with
my
soul
no
man
preaching
benefited
me
more
but
in
so
far
as
my
soul
was
feminine
and
peculiar
to
me
i
took
it
as
an
indication
that
providence
meant
it
to
remain
so
and
i
never
betrayed
it
not
even
to
him
but
i
could
not
keep
other
women
from
doing
so
there
was
a
beautiful
lady
in
the
church
at
orionville
who
gave
bible
readings
as
if
they
were
soprano
solos
she
was
always
beautifully
gowned
for
the
occasion
and
had
an
expression
of
pretty
pink
piety
that
was
irresistible
she
was
not
happy
at
home
and
candidly
confessed
it
the
lack
of
congeniality
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
her
husband
was
a
straightforward
business
man
who
took
no
interest
in
her
bible
readings
but
he
was
about
the
only
man
in
the
church
who
did
not
and
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
she
would
have
betrayed
william
in
the
second
book
of
samuel
if
i
had
not
intervened
she
had
been
coming
to
the
parsonage
regularly
for
a
month
consulting
him
about
her
interpretation
of
these
scriptures
she
asked
for
him
at
the
door
as
simply
as
if
i
had
been
his
and
william
was
always
cheered
and
invigorated
by
her
visits
he
would
come
out
of
his
study
to
tea
after
her
departure
rubbing
his
hands
and
praising
the
beautiful
spiritual
clearness
of
her
mind
which
he
considered
very
remarkable
in
a
woman
poor
william
i
never
destroyed
his
illusions
for
they
were
always
founded
upon
the
goodness
and
simplicity
of
his
own
nature
but
when
billywith
began
to
spend
three
afternoons
of
the
week
with
him
in
his
study
with
nobody
but
the
second
samuel
to
chaperon
them
and
when
william
began
to
neglect
his
pastoral
visiting
on
this
account
i
could
have
felt
the
call
to
put
an
end
to
the
interpretations
stronger
than
i
did
if
i
had
been
his
guardian
angel
the
next
time
she
came
he
was
out
visiting
the
sick
come
right
in
billywith
i
said
leading
her
into
the
study
and
seating
myself
opposite
her
when
she
had
chosen
her
chair
william
is
out
this
afternoon
but
possibly
i
can
help
you
with
the
kind
of
interpretation
you
ought
to
do
now
better
than
he
can
she
stared
at
me
with
a
look
of
proud
surprise
you
and
william
have
spent
a
very
profitable
month
i
reckon
on
second
samuel
but
i
been
thinking
that
maybe
you
ought
to
have
a
change
now
and
stay
at
home
some
and
try
to
interpret
your
own
samuel
your
husband
given
name
is
sam
is
it
he
seems
to
me
a
neglected
prophet
billywith
and
needs
his
spiritual
faculties
exercised
and
strengthened
more
than
william
does
besides
i
never
finished
the
sentence
billywith
rose
with
the
look
of
an
angel
who
has
been
outraged
floated
through
the
open
door
and
disappeared
down
the
shady
street
william
never
knew
or
even
suspected
why
she
discontinued
so
interesting
a
study
nor
why
he
could
never
again
induce
her
to
give
one
of
her
beautiful
bible
readings
on
nights
you
will
say
of
course
that
i
was
jealous
of
my
husband
but
i
was
not
jealous
for
him
only
as
a
husband
i
was
even
more
jealous
for
him
as
the
simplest
best
most
saintly
man
i
had
ever
known
and
the
preacher
wife
who
does
not
cultivate
the
wisdom
of
a
serpent
and
as
much
harmlessness
of
the
dove
as
will
not
interfere
with
her
duty
to
him
in
protecting
him
from
such
women
whose
souls
are
merely
mortal
and
who
are
to
be
found
in
so
many
congregations
may
have
a
damaged
priest
on
her
hands
before
she
knows
it
and
there
is
not
a
more
difficult
soul
to
restore
in
this
world
except
a
woman
ever
after
it
sits
uneasy
in
him
it
aches
and
cries
out
in
darkness
even
at
noonday
and
you
have
to
go
and
do
it
all
over
again
the
restoring
some
one
who
understands
real
moral
values
ought
to
make
a
new
set
of
civil
laws
that
would
apply
to
the
worst
class
of
criminals
in
society
not
the
poor
hungry
rogues
the
primitive
murderers
but
the
real
rotters
of
honor
and
destroyers
of
salvation
then
we
should
have
a
very
different
class
of
people
in
the
penitentiaries
and
not
the
least
numerous
among
them
would
be
the
women
who
make
a
religion
of
sneaking
up
on
the
blind
male
side
of
good
men
without
a
thought
of
the
consequences
chapter
x
william
becomes
a
prodigal
william
never
made
but
two
long
journeys
away
from
home
one
was
to
visit
a
brother
minister
the
other
was
a
sort
of
involuntary
excursion
he
made
away
from
god
in
his
own
mind
and
as
the
first
trip
led
to
the
second
i
will
begin
with
that
there
was
a
young
man
in
william
class
at
college
named
horace
pendleton
who
entered
the
ministry
with
him
and
joined
the
north
georgia
conference
at
the
same
time
william
had
that
devotion
for
him
one
often
sees
in
a
good
man
for
just
a
smart
one
he
placed
an
extravagant
value
upon
his
gifts
and
he
was
one
of
the
heroes
of
our
younger
married
years
about
whom
he
talked
with
affectionate
blindness
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
horace
pendleton
had
a
gift
the
gift
of
rising
you
might
have
thought
he
was
in
the
world
instead
of
the
church
he
went
up
so
fast
he
had
been
ordained
scarcely
long
enough
to
become
a
deacon
before
he
was
well
enough
known
to
be
preaching
commencement
sermons
at
young
ladies
seminaries
and
delivering
lectures
everywhere
he
had
that
naïve
bravery
of
intelligence
which
enabled
him
to
accept
with
dignity
an
invitation
to
lecture
on
any
subject
from
sunshine
to
the
psychology
of
st
paul
i
remember
him
very
well
in
those
days
a
thin
long
young
man
with
a
face
so
narrow
and
tight
and
bright
that
when
he
talked
in
his
high
metallic
voice
one
received
the
impression
of
light
streaming
in
up
his
higher
nature
through
a
keyhole
i
specify
higher
nature
because
pendleton
never
addressed
himself
to
any
other
part
of
the
spiritual
anatomy
i
always
had
the
feeling
when
i
heard
him
that
he
inflated
each
word
so
that
some
of
the
weightiest
and
most
ancient
verbs
in
the
scriptures
floated
from
his
lips
as
lightly
as
if
they
had
been
the
theological
of
a
growing
angel
his
grandest
thoughts
and
he
was
as
full
of
them
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
seemed
to
cut
monkeyshines
and
to
make
faces
back
at
him
the
moment
he
uttered
them
personally
i
never
liked
him
he
talked
too
much
about
sacrifice
and
was
entirely
too
fortunate
himself
maybe
i
was
jealous
of
him
the
contrast
between
his
career
in
the
ministry
and
that
of
william
was
certainly
striking
he
had
been
made
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
was
filling
the
best
churches
in
his
conference
while
william
and
i
were
still
serving
mountain
circuits
and
it
was
not
long
before
none
of
the
churches
in
our
conference
were
good
enough
for
him
so
he
had
to
be
transferred
to
get
one
commensurate
with
his
ability
even
then
he
had
enough
surplus
energy
to
run
a
sideline
in
literature
i
have
always
thought
that
if
he
had
been
a
land
agent
instead
of
a
preacher
he
could
have
sold
the
whole
of
alaska
and
the
adjacent
icebergs
in
one
quadrennium
and
i
reckon
i
may
as
well
admit
that
there
was
an
invincible
streak
of
meanness
in
me
which
prevented
my
admiring
him
for
from
start
to
finish
he
was
a
man
of
impeccable
reputation
and
undoubtedly
irreproachable
character
as
we
use
those
words
and
i
could
have
admired
him
as
anything
else
but
a
preacher
it
was
his
shockingly
developed
talent
for
worldly
success
that
revolted
me
to
this
day
the
gospel
the
real
gospel
sounds
better
more
like
gospel
to
me
if
it
is
preached
by
a
man
who
is
literally
poor
maybe
it
is
because
i
learned
to
revere
this
trait
in
william
but
in
every
way
always
william
could
surpass
me
in
the
dignity
of
love
so
he
went
on
loving
horace
pendleton
he
believed
that
the
lord
was
lavish
in
favors
to
him
because
of
his
superior
worth
and
this
accounted
for
his
good
fortune
and
i
never
interfered
with
any
of
william
idolatries
they
were
all
creditable
to
him
at
last
the
time
came
when
he
received
an
invitation
from
pendleton
who
was
now
pastor
of
the
leading
methodist
church
in
a
flourishing
city
in
another
state
to
visit
him
they
had
always
kept
up
a
sort
of
desultory
correspondence
and
i
am
sure
pendleton
never
received
finer
laurels
of
praise
than
william
sent
him
in
his
letters
we
were
in
a
small
town
that
year
in
the
malarial
district
and
william
health
was
not
good
it
was
early
spring
before
the
revival
season
opened
and
it
so
happened
that
there
was
some
kind
of
political
convention
on
hand
which
enabled
him
to
secure
special
rates
on
the
railroad
so
one
morning
in
april
i
plumed
and
preened
him
in
his
best
clothes
and
sent
him
on
his
happy
journey
when
he
returned
a
week
later
william
was
a
changed
man
he
talked
with
a
breadth
and
intelligence
upon
many
old
and
new
subjects
that
i
had
never
observed
in
him
before
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
great
in
him
had
faded
he
was
stuffed
to
the
neck
with
ethics
as
loose
fitting
morally
as
the
sack
coat
of
and
he
did
not
suspect
it
his
very
expression
had
changed
he
looked
well
to
put
it
as
mildly
as
i
can
william
looked
sophisticated
and
it
is
as
belittling
a
look
as
a
good
man
can
wear
there
is
a
moses
simplicity
about
goodness
that
has
never
been
improved
upon
by
the
wisest
of
the
smartest
man
that
ever
lived
and
william
simplicity
had
been
blurred
mary
he
said
to
me
as
we
sat
at
our
evening
meal
the
day
after
his
return
i
must
read
and
study
more
this
visit
has
been
an
to
me
i
am
sadly
behind
the
times
yes
william
i
replied
shrewdly
for
i
had
never
heard
him
talk
so
fresh
before
you
must
read
and
study
more
for
a
preacher
has
something
bigger
than
times
on
his
conscience
what
do
you
mean
that
the
times
are
so
transient
that
a
preacher
is
called
to
deliver
a
message
about
what
is
far
more
permanent
i
think
mary
he
went
on
assuming
the
reasoning
air
that
a
man
always
takes
when
he
thinks
he
is
trying
to
make
a
woman
think
but
when
he
is
only
trying
to
make
her
agree
with
what
he
thinks
i
think
one
reason
why
pendleton
has
gotten
on
in
the
church
and
been
of
so
much
more
service
there
than
i
have
is
because
he
has
kept
up
with
his
times
he
is
a
very
learned
man
and
he
preaches
right
up
to
the
present
moment
i
scarcely
have
recognized
some
of
the
scriptures
as
he
interpreted
them
in
the
light
of
modern
criticism
and
conditions
you
are
right
william
there
is
no
doubt
that
horace
pendleton
has
risen
in
the
church
and
been
of
more
service
to
the
church
than
you
have
been
because
he
knows
so
much
better
than
you
do
how
to
make
it
and
how
to
intone
the
gospel
to
the
same
tune
but
william
are
you
going
to
begin
to
interpret
the
scriptures
just
to
suit
your
times
and
modern
conditions
i
thought
scriptures
had
nothing
to
do
with
mere
that
they
belonged
to
the
order
of
things
i
fear
you
are
prejudiced
against
pendleton
and
incapable
of
seeing
the
good
in
what
he
says
yet
he
showed
a
great
interest
in
me
and
he
talked
to
me
very
seriously
about
the
limitations
of
my
ministry
what
did
he
say
for
one
thing
he
said
i
was
identified
with
a
view
of
god
and
man
and
the
world
such
as
no
intelligent
healthy
disciple
of
christ
after
the
fashion
of
john
wesley
ever
held
could
you
tell
what
view
of
god
was
no
i
could
not
that
was
my
ignorance
i
could
not
keep
up
with
him
he
preached
a
very
powerful
sermon
from
one
of
the
best
texts
in
the
new
testament
the
sunday
i
was
there
he
could
have
done
that
unless
he
had
had
a
very
plain
view
of
god
oh
yes
he
could
i
retorted
you
can
preach
a
much
more
satisfactorily
powerful
sermon
in
a
fashionable
modern
church
if
you
do
see
god
than
if
you
do
still
william
persisted
he
began
to
read
strange
books
that
pendleton
had
loaned
him
and
the
more
he
read
the
gloomier
he
looked
his
vocabulary
changed
in
the
course
of
fourteen
days
i
remember
the
word
salvation
did
not
pass
his
lips
and
i
could
have
prayed
as
good
a
prayer
as
he
prayed
any
night
as
we
knelt
together
the
time
came
indeed
when
i
seriously
considered
making
him
the
object
of
special
prayer
on
the
sly
only
william
was
so
really
good
i
was
ashamed
to
show
this
lack
of
confidence
in
him
to
the
lord
meanwhile
the
sabbath
in
june
when
the
protracted
meeting
usually
began
approached
and
i
knew
if
things
did
not
change
it
would
be
a
flat
failure
for
william
was
in
a
blue
funk
spiritually
i
can
not
think
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
complained
to
me
late
one
afternoon
as
we
sat
on
the
parsonage
steps
waiting
for
the
prayer
meeting
bell
to
ring
you
have
backslid
william
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
listened
to
the
voice
of
horace
pendleton
till
you
can
not
hear
the
voice
of
god
you
no
longer
have
the
single
eye
it
has
been
bunged
up
put
out
that
was
the
first
and
last
sermon
i
ever
preached
to
william
it
was
a
short
one
but
it
brought
him
forward
for
prayers
so
to
speak
and
for
the
next
few
days
we
had
a
terrible
time
at
the
parsonage
he
was
an
honest
man
and
he
was
not
slow
to
recognize
his
condition
once
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
it
is
not
so
bad
to
lose
the
witness
of
the
spirit
because
you
can
still
believe
in
god
and
presently
the
witness
is
there
again
but
when
you
begin
to
read
books
that
curtail
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
and
make
your
heavenly
father
just
a
natural
force
in
the
universe
when
you
bud
and
blossom
into
rationalism
there
is
a
good
deal
of
mischief
to
pay
i
do
not
say
that
pendleton
went
this
far
but
the
books
he
read
and
loaned
to
william
did
and
they
unconsciously
had
a
profounder
effect
upon
william
than
they
had
on
pendleton
because
william
really
had
a
soul
i
am
not
saying
pendleton
did
not
have
you
understand
i
am
an
agnostic
on
that
subject
but
to
have
a
soul
and
to
be
without
an
immediate
almighty
is
to
experience
a
frightful
tragedy
if
a
man
never
recognizes
this
diviner
part
of
himself
he
may
live
and
die
in
the
comfort
or
discomfort
of
any
other
mere
creature
but
once
you
realize
your
own
immortality
i
make
a
distinction
here
between
the
of
immortality
and
the
loud
preaching
of
it
that
a
man
may
do
just
from
biblical
hearsay
you
are
a
lonesome
waif
in
a
bad
storm
this
was
william
fix
he
was
exposed
all
at
once
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
infinitudes
but
i
ceased
to
worry
once
he
began
to
really
pray
and
scourge
himself
and
i
did
not
interrupt
the
chastening
usually
when
he
insisted
upon
fasting
all
day
friday
i
provided
little
intelligent
temptations
to
food
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
but
this
time
i
let
him
starve
to
his
heart
content
i
reckon
i
am
a
woman
and
always
shall
be
but
i
know
another
higher
minded
man
when
i
see
one
and
i
have
always
been
careful
not
to
drag
william
down
now
i
was
equally
determined
that
horace
pendleton
should
not
once
during
the
dreadful
time
he
came
out
of
his
study
and
looked
at
me
vaguely
pleadingly
as
if
he
wanted
help
do
look
at
me
that
way
william
i
cried
i
ca
do
anything
but
kiss
you
i
never
did
know
where
your
god
was
but
you
knew
and
you
just
have
to
go
back
the
way
you
came
to
him
all
i
know
for
certain
is
that
there
is
a
god
your
kind
or
you
could
never
have
lived
the
way
you
have
lived
nor
accomplished
the
things
you
have
accomplished
you
could
have
you
have
sense
enough
and
for
this
reason
you
better
not
try
to
think
your
way
back
if
god
is
god
he
is
far
beyond
our
little
thinking
you
had
better
feel
your
way
to
him
it
is
what
you
call
faith
in
your
sermons
something
like
this
is
what
i
said
to
him
standing
before
him
with
my
head
on
his
breast
wiping
the
tears
from
my
eyes
really
a
spiritually
sick
preacher
is
about
the
most
depressing
thing
a
woman
can
have
in
the
house
and
when
i
looked
at
william
pale
with
his
mouth
puckered
into
a
penitential
angle
i
longed
to
lay
horace
pendleton
across
my
knees
and
give
him
what
he
deserved
for
disturbing
a
better
man
peace
about
the
middle
of
saturday
afternoon
however
i
knew
that
his
clouds
were
breaking
i
heard
him
in
his
study
singing
how
firm
a
foundation
ye
saints
of
the
lord
is
laid
for
your
faith
in
his
excellent
word
illustration
i
heard
him
in
his
study
singing
later
on
at
he
chose
a
cheerful
psalm
to
read
and
i
heard
the
happy
rustling
of
his
wings
in
the
prayer
he
made
the
next
evening
had
been
chosen
for
the
initial
service
of
the
protracted
meeting
and
i
remember
his
text
i
count
all
things
but
loss
for
the
excellency
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
jesus
my
lord
for
whom
i
have
suffered
the
loss
of
all
things
and
do
count
them
but
refuse
that
i
may
win
christ
and
be
found
in
him
i
remember
it
because
i
remember
william
so
well
that
evening
he
fitted
into
it
as
if
it
was
his
home
the
great
words
seemed
to
belong
to
him
they
were
his
experience
literally
they
had
the
authority
of
another
simple
faithful
brave
life
behind
them
besides
that
of
paul
and
the
people
who
listened
knew
it
if
william
had
made
a
great
name
and
fame
for
himself
out
of
preaching
if
he
had
earned
fancy
salaries
as
the
pastor
in
rich
churches
it
would
have
been
different
i
do
know
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case
they
might
have
clanged
a
little
like
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbals
he
stood
in
the
little
dim
pulpit
the
summer
evening
was
fading
the
lamps
in
the
church
had
not
been
lighted
and
the
faces
of
the
village
folk
were
softened
sweetened
in
the
gentle
sabbath
gloom
he
drew
a
picture
of
paul
in
prison
at
rome
old
and
in
anticipation
of
his
end
william
never
knew
how
to
use
words
fancifully
therefore
they
used
to
gather
together
truthfully
in
his
sermons
as
if
he
had
wove
them
in
and
so
now
we
had
not
an
portrait
of
paul
but
we
saw
him
really
the
man
who
actually
had
counted
all
things
but
loss
for
the
excellency
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
jesus
so
out
of
his
bonds
in
the
spirit
it
takes
a
rare
preacher
to
portray
one
found
in
christ
he
can
not
do
it
with
the
best
theological
vocabulary
nor
the
finest
scientific
terms
but
william
i
can
not
tell
how
he
did
it
all
i
know
is
that
every
time
he
put
his
sentences
together
they
cast
again
the
image
of
the
saviour
upon
every
heart
before
him
he
stood
like
a
man
who
has
his
hand
upon
the
of
the
door
of
his
father
house
counting
over
one
by
one
the
things
to
be
lost
and
gained
there
nothing
remained
but
a
few
simple
things
like
loving
one
another
he
removed
the
world
and
the
cares
of
it
and
set
our
feet
in
the
way
of
life
like
a
wise
man
guiding
little
children
if
horace
pendleton
had
put
all
he
knew
into
one
discourse
garnished
it
with
a
thousand
terms
taken
from
the
new
theology
he
could
not
have
approached
the
awful
simplicity
and
the
high
sweetness
of
that
sermon
but
one
thing
i
must
remember
to
tell
as
long
as
he
lived
william
loved
and
honored
this
man
with
perfect
devotion
that
is
the
wonderful
thing
about
being
good
you
see
it
always
your
eyes
are
happily
holden
to
evil
on
the
other
hand
i
had
occasion
to
learn
after
william
death
that
pendleton
regarded
him
with
derision
he
thought
him
a
stupid
man
bound
down
to
the
earth
by
a
meager
theology
he
even
wrote
an
obituary
notice
of
william
that
must
have
made
his
guardian
angel
long
to
kick
him
all
a
grand
toot
to
show
the
contrast
between
a
preacher
like
himself
and
a
foolish
old
stutterer
like
william
chapter
xi
finances
and
fashions
it
is
curious
what
things
are
revealed
to
us
as
we
go
along
i
used
to
wonder
because
william
wondered
where
in
what
year
paul
did
this
or
that
which
is
recorded
in
acts
i
remember
how
william
used
to
get
down
his
commentaries
and
squint
everywhere
along
margins
for
dates
to
discover
exactly
where
he
was
in
the
spring
say
of
at
the
time
it
was
passing
strange
to
me
that
no
exact
record
of
dates
was
taken
concerning
the
doings
of
a
man
who
occasionally
turned
the
world
upside
down
as
he
went
through
it
but
now
it
is
perfectly
clear
those
who
wrote
never
specified
whether
it
was
the
first
or
second
sunday
that
paul
said
thus
and
so
at
antioch
the
record
was
merely
of
the
timeless
truth
he
uttered
because
paul
and
the
rest
of
them
engaged
in
this
and
doing
back
there
were
already
out
of
time
in
their
consciousness
they
were
figures
in
eternity
making
the
great
journey
by
another
calendar
than
ours
since
i
have
been
writing
this
poor
record
of
william
it
is
not
time
that
matters
to
me
i
forget
to
tell
of
his
years
in
each
chapter
or
to
describe
the
changes
in
his
appearance
the
things
he
did
the
prayers
he
prayed
the
faith
he
exercised
these
crowd
the
memory
all
so
much
alike
as
one
day
resembles
another
day
and
as
one
prayer
resembles
another
prayer
but
the
dates
have
long
since
faded
from
my
mind
i
can
not
recall
for
example
when
his
shoulders
first
began
to
stoop
nor
when
he
ceased
to
go
nor
the
year
it
was
that
his
hair
and
beard
whitened
nor
when
the
hollows
deepened
to
stay
beneath
his
eyes
all
i
remember
for
certain
was
the
changeless
spirit
of
him
and
the
unconquerable
courage
he
showed
about
getting
ready
to
put
off
his
mortality
and
the
definite
curious
vividness
with
which
he
anticipated
immortality
and
in
other
ways
i
have
unusual
difficulty
in
telling
here
what
he
said
and
did
the
activities
of
a
minister
life
differ
so
widely
from
the
activities
of
any
other
life
that
even
to
set
them
down
requires
a
peculiar
vocabulary
one
can
not
find
the
right
kind
even
in
church
reports
and
statistics
but
they
must
bear
some
great
likeness
to
the
words
used
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
i
do
not
know
how
to
describe
them
but
every
man
knows
them
when
he
hears
them
for
the
language
of
christianity
is
the
one
language
that
never
changes
it
gets
a
new
translation
now
and
then
but
it
is
always
informed
with
the
same
spirit
the
same
lofty
and
verbs
and
the
minister
learns
them
because
he
needs
them
in
the
world
where
he
moves
i
make
an
exception
here
of
those
preachers
who
develop
a
gift
for
church
enterprise
for
getting
up
funds
for
improvements
of
one
sort
and
another
the
account
they
give
of
their
stewardship
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
any
other
business
man
and
they
are
needed
they
do
the
greater
part
towards
keeping
the
church
housed
conspicuously
steepled
and
visible
to
the
world
that
passes
by
they
are
the
preachers
in
every
conference
who
are
sent
to
works
where
a
new
church
or
a
new
parsonage
is
needed
and
some
of
them
have
heroic
records
in
collecting
for
these
purposes
i
would
not
take
a
single
dollar
from
the
sum
of
their
renown
but
this
is
a
memorial
to
william
and
he
was
not
one
of
these
he
was
really
an
excellent
preacher
a
devoted
pastor
but
he
had
more
spiritual
intuitions
than
common
sense
about
managing
the
practical
details
of
the
pastorate
i
recognized
this
deficiency
in
him
as
we
went
along
together
in
the
itinerancy
and
feeling
that
it
was
important
for
the
presiding
elder
to
have
a
good
opinion
of
him
in
every
way
i
must
have
perjured
myself
to
every
one
of
them
year
by
year
singing
william
praises
as
a
business
man
when
i
knew
he
was
as
innocent
of
business
as
the
angels
in
heaven
if
he
had
been
the
kind
of
man
i
represented
him
to
be
he
would
have
been
a
sort
of
hallelujah
cross
and
crisscross
between
daniel
webster
john
rockefeller
and
paul
and
i
remember
the
genial
patience
with
which
the
elders
used
to
listen
to
my
williamanic
paeans
but
they
could
not
have
believed
me
for
he
was
never
sent
to
a
place
where
visible
mortar
and
stone
work
had
to
be
accomplished
for
the
advancement
of
the
church
and
now
when
it
is
all
over
when
the
violets
are
blooming
so
much
at
home
above
his
dear
dust
i
feel
at
last
that
i
can
afford
to
confess
his
beautiful
limitations
after
you
are
dead
it
does
matter
if
you
were
not
successful
in
a
business
way
no
one
has
yet
had
the
courage
to
memorialize
his
wealth
on
his
tombstone
a
dollar
mark
would
not
look
well
there
the
best
epitaph
proclaims
simple
old
scripture
virtues
like
honesty
and
diligence
and
patience
and
you
will
observe
that
when
the
meanest
skinflint
or
the
most
disgracefully
avaricious
millionaire
dies
his
tombstone
never
refers
to
his
most
notorious
characteristics
his
friends
speak
not
of
his
scandalous
speculations
but
of
his
benevolences
thus
some
of
the
most
conscienceless
rogues
in
a
generation
go
down
to
posterity
with
expurgated
tablets
to
their
memory
which
of
course
is
best
for
posterity
so
i
do
not
mind
now
admitting
that
william
was
a
poor
but
he
actually
did
have
the
virtues
that
look
well
recorded
on
his
tombstone
i
can
even
recall
with
a
sort
of
tearful
humor
some
of
his
efforts
at
practical
church
thinking
he
entertained
with
naïve
enthusiasm
for
example
a
certain
proposition
for
regulating
the
support
of
the
ministry
and
would
have
sent
it
as
a
memorial
to
the
general
conference
but
for
my
interference
he
had
elaborated
a
plan
by
which
every
methodist
preacher
should
receive
his
salary
on
the
pro
rata
basis
as
the
superannuates
do
according
to
the
funds
in
hand
and
according
to
their
needs
it
would
be
taken
like
any
other
conference
collection
turned
in
like
any
other
to
the
treasury
for
this
purpose
but
the
preacher
on
a
mountain
circuit
with
a
wife
and
eight
children
would
receive
hundred
dollars
and
the
one
with
only
a
wife
even
though
he
might
be
the
pastor
of
a
rich
city
church
would
receive
only
a
thousand
dollars
such
a
distribution
of
income
would
have
placed
a
premium
upon
ministerial
posterity
and
would
have
been
as
fatal
as
socialism
to
competition
for
the
best
pulpits
in
the
church
connection
but
i
did
not
use
this
argument
to
william
he
could
not
appreciate
it
he
was
even
capable
of
claiming
that
it
proved
the
virtue
of
his
proposition
william
i
exclaimed
when
he
confided
in
me
promise
me
that
you
will
never
mention
this
dreadful
plan
not
even
to
a
steward
or
to
the
presiding
elder
it
tends
to
socialism
communism
and
to
church
volcanics
generally
your
reputation
would
be
ruined
if
you
were
suspected
of
entertaining
such
incendiary
ideas
he
was
aghast
having
always
regarded
the
very
terms
i
used
to
describe
his
plan
with
righteous
horror
and
that
was
the
last
i
ever
heard
of
his
pro
rata
salary
system
still
if
all
the
preachers
in
the
church
were
as
literally
in
earnest
about
living
just
to
preach
the
gospel
as
william
was
it
would
have
been
a
good
one
the
fact
is
they
are
not
the
very
gifted
highly
educated
pastor
of
a
rich
city
church
feels
it
down
to
his
spiritual
bones
that
his
gospel
is
worth
more
than
that
of
the
itinerant
on
a
country
circuit
and
most
of
them
would
have
to
experience
something
more
illuminating
and
stringent
even
than
the
second
blessing
before
they
could
be
made
to
see
the
matter
differently
and
i
do
not
blame
them
we
just
ca
get
over
being
human
and
greedy
and
covetous
anywhere
it
seems
especially
in
a
rich
pulpit
william
stood
a
better
chance
for
developing
the
right
heavenly
mind
in
his
part
of
the
vineyard
and
i
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
to
see
the
way
he
grew
in
grace
and
in
that
finer
sweeter
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
his
ways
but
i
never
was
i
used
to
think
too
that
his
gospel
was
worth
more
than
some
other
preacher
who
received
a
better
salary
but
it
comforts
me
now
to
know
that
he
never
thought
it
if
william
was
covetous
about
anything
it
was
salvation
he
was
never
satisfied
with
being
as
good
as
he
was
he
was
always
longing
and
praying
and
going
about
in
the
effort
just
to
be
a
better
man
more
worthy
of
the
message
he
had
to
deliver
these
were
the
kind
of
seraphic
pleasures
he
took
in
living
and
there
was
no
mortal
power
no
poverty
or
hardship
that
could
do
him
out
of
them
he
would
come
back
from
feeding
some
vicious
sinner
with
his
gospel
substances
exhilarated
it
seemed
to
strengthen
his
spirit
to
drive
five
miles
through
freezing
winter
weather
to
some
country
church
to
preach
to
half
a
dozen
men
and
women
who
may
have
only
come
on
such
a
bad
day
with
the
hope
of
finding
that
the
preacher
failed
to
come
a
shepherd
unfaithful
to
his
flock
in
a
trying
season
and
of
course
if
you
are
called
to
preach
this
is
the
way
to
be
but
if
you
are
called
to
be
just
the
wife
of
a
preacher
it
is
different
i
do
not
say
it
ought
to
be
but
it
is
i
used
to
get
tired
of
being
poor
in
spirit
there
came
days
when
i
wanted
to
inherit
the
earth
the
real
earth
you
understand
the
figure
of
speech
might
have
been
better
for
my
soul
but
what
i
hankered
after
was
something
opulent
and
comfortable
for
just
the
human
me
and
this
brings
to
mind
an
incident
that
happened
when
i
was
in
one
of
these
moods
we
were
stationed
that
year
at
celestial
bells
a
place
where
as
i
have
already
intimated
the
people
had
some
kind
of
happy
beam
in
their
eye
they
were
not
only
willing
to
be
christians
they
were
determined
to
be
but
they
were
equally
determined
to
enjoy
every
other
good
thing
they
saw
in
sight
this
led
to
many
social
occasions
afternoon
teas
receptions
innocent
entertainments
to
no
end
of
visiting
and
to
a
fashionableness
in
everybody
appearance
that
was
scandalously
fascinating
to
me
now
and
then
i
have
heard
some
stupid
stranger
refer
to
celestial
bells
as
an
ugly
little
town
but
in
my
memory
it
is
spread
forever
in
the
sun
sweetly
shining
like
a
wing
of
paradise
it
was
there
after
so
many
years
that
i
came
in
contact
again
with
simple
human
gayety
with
women
prettily
gowned
with
the
charming
clatter
of
light
conversation
and
within
the
sound
of
music
that
was
not
always
hymnal
i
do
not
say
mind
you
that
i
did
not
listen
always
reverently
and
gratefully
to
william
higher
talk
nor
that
i
have
ever
ceased
to
enjoy
good
church
music
but
i
am
confessing
that
in
spite
of
long
training
in
monologues
and
organ
tunes
i
was
still
ecstatically
capable
of
this
other
kind
of
delight
as
the
minister
wife
i
was
asked
everywhere
in
all
communities
the
preacher
wife
is
given
the
free
moral
opportunity
to
draw
her
own
line
between
the
world
and
the
church
if
she
refuses
a
series
of
invitations
to
teas
and
clubs
and
receptions
it
is
understood
that
she
is
not
of
the
world
will
have
none
of
it
and
she
is
left
to
pursue
her
pious
way
to
just
the
church
services
and
missionary
meetings
but
i
refused
to
draw
the
spiritual
line
between
tea
parties
and
the
study
evening
i
accepted
every
invitation
with
alacrity
there
was
nothing
radically
wrong
i
believe
with
my
heavenly
mind
it
simply
extended
further
down
and
around
about
than
that
of
some
others
in
my
position
one
circumstance
only
interfered
with
my
pleasures
this
was
the
curious
sag
and
limpness
and
color
and
style
of
my
clothes
it
is
no
mystery
to
me
why
dress
fashions
for
women
connected
with
the
itinerancy
tend
to
mourning
shades
when
you
put
the
world
out
of
your
life
you
put
the
sweet
vanity
of
color
out
you
eschew
red
and
pink
and
tender
and
present
your
bodies
living
sacrifices
in
black
materials
i
do
not
believe
that
god
requires
it
the
maker
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
of
the
green
boughs
and
of
the
flowers
must
be
a
lover
of
colors
but
i
can
not
recall
ever
having
seen
a
circuit
rider
wife
in
my
life
whose
few
garments
were
not
pathetically
dashed
with
this
gloom
of
mourning
darkness
so
when
we
came
to
celestial
bells
i
say
i
had
a
black
sateen
waist
and
a
gray
cheviot
skirt
still
worthy
to
be
worn
to
church
and
prayer
meeting
services
and
a
sadder
blacker
gown
that
had
done
service
for
four
years
upon
funeral
occasions
and
others
equally
as
solemn
like
weddings
these
were
all
except
the
calicos
i
wore
at
home
the
result
was
that
i
must
have
looked
like
some
sort
of
sacrilegious
crow
at
every
social
function
in
celestial
bells
during
the
first
few
months
but
as
the
spring
advanced
i
took
my
courage
in
my
hands
and
resolved
to
have
a
blue
foulard
silk
it
was
frightfully
expensive
cents
a
yard
in
fact
to
say
nothing
of
a
white
lace
yoke
and
a
black
panne
velvet
belt
but
no
bride
ever
contemplated
her
going
away
gown
with
more
satisfaction
i
pictured
myself
in
it
before
i
even
purchased
it
attending
sister
z
tea
party
like
other
i
do
not
recommend
this
as
high
ambition
but
those
preachers
wives
in
the
remote
places
who
have
worn
drab
and
sorrowfully
cut
clothes
for
years
will
know
how
i
felt
i
think
there
is
something
pitiful
in
women
just
here
no
matter
how
old
and
consecrated
they
get
they
do
in
their
secret
hearts
often
long
to
be
pretty
to
look
well
dressed
and
yes
the
latter
is
so
becoming
to
them
but
it
is
in
the
itinerancy
as
it
is
in
other
walks
of
life
just
as
you
think
you
are
about
to
get
your
natural
heart
desire
somebody
slams
the
bible
down
on
it
or
gets
an
answer
to
prayer
that
spoils
your
pleasure
in
it
so
it
was
in
my
case
it
was
the
first
foreign
missionary
meeting
of
the
new
fiscal
year
one
day
in
march
we
met
at
sister
macl
house
the
jonquils
were
in
bloom
the
world
was
fair
and
out
in
the
orchards
we
could
see
the
peach
trees
one
mass
of
pink
blossoms
i
never
felt
more
religious
or
thankful
in
my
life
there
in
the
little
green
parlor
listening
to
the
opening
hymn
the
roll
was
called
showing
that
we
had
an
unusually
full
meeting
the
minutes
were
read
then
came
a
discussion
concerning
dues
for
the
coming
year
all
this
time
sister
shaller
had
been
presiding
with
her
usual
dignity
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
childless
and
much
praised
for
her
interest
in
church
works
she
was
rich
and
enjoyed
the
peculiar
distinction
of
wearing
very
fashionable
gowns
even
to
church
upon
this
occasion
something
reserved
potential
and
authoritative
in
her
manner
made
me
nervous
i
had
a
premonition
that
she
was
after
somebody
dearest
idol
and
i
was
not
left
long
in
suspense
as
to
whose
it
was
fixing
her
wide
brown
eyes
upon
us
with
hypnotic
intensity
she
said
she
had
felt
moved
unaccountably
moved
to
tell
the
auxiliary
that
we
must
support
a
foreign
female
missionary
this
coming
year
the
silence
that
met
this
announcement
was
sad
and
submissive
we
were
already
paying
all
the
dues
we
could
afford
this
meant
fifty
dollars
extra
and
not
a
single
one
of
us
wanted
to
send
the
missionary
except
sister
shaller
she
went
on
to
say
in
her
deep
mezzo
soprano
voice
that
she
knew
it
meant
sacrifice
for
us
but
that
it
was
by
just
such
sacrifices
that
we
grew
in
grace
and
she
desired
to
suggest
the
nature
of
the
sacrifice
one
that
we
would
probably
feel
the
most
and
would
therefore
be
the
most
beneficial
suppose
each
of
us
resolves
to
do
without
our
spring
gown
for
easter
oh
my
sisters
we
could
probably
send
two
instead
of
one
missionary
then
and
we
will
have
at
the
same
time
curbed
the
weakness
and
vanity
of
our
female
natures
the
rich
plumes
in
her
hat
trembled
with
the
depth
of
her
emotions
her
pretty
silk
skirts
rustled
softly
but
the
silence
continued
if
she
had
asked
for
the
sacrifice
of
any
but
our
easter
things
i
reckon
we
could
have
borne
it
better
but
probably
there
was
not
a
woman
in
the
room
whose
imagination
had
not
already
been
cavorting
under
her
prospective
easter
bonnet
as
for
me
i
never
felt
so
circumvented
and
outraged
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
as
a
preacher
wife
i
had
the
samples
in
my
bag
at
that
moment
and
was
only
waiting
for
the
adjournment
of
the
meeting
to
go
to
the
store
on
my
way
home
to
purchase
my
foulard
there
is
one
thing
we
have
all
noticed
about
a
silence
especially
in
a
company
of
friends
if
it
lasts
too
long
it
gets
sullen
and
pregnant
with
the
animosity
of
unspoken
thoughts
when
the
silence
was
approaching
this
stage
sister
macl
who
had
a
sort
of
cradle
heart
for
soothing
everyone
murmured
in
her
crooning
voice
let
us
take
it
to
the
lord
in
prayer
and
we
were
about
to
rise
and
kneel
like
a
set
of
angry
children
before
our
smiling
heavenly
father
when
something
either
moral
or
immoral
stiffened
in
me
and
i
startled
even
myself
with
these
words
that
seemed
to
come
of
their
own
accord
out
of
my
mouth
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
was
oblivious
to
the
horrified
gaze
of
my
companions
i
felt
some
spirit
strengthen
me
and
give
me
courage
i
had
a
quick
vision
of
the
years
behind
me
and
of
the
figure
i
made
walking
always
down
the
aisle
of
some
church
by
william
in
my
dismal
black
dress
or
sitting
at
a
funeral
or
even
at
a
feast
always
in
that
ugly
black
garment
sister
shaller
i
said
looking
steadily
at
her
as
a
child
looks
at
another
child
who
is
trying
to
take
some
cherished
plaything
from
it
you
can
do
as
you
please
about
sending
that
missionary
you
are
perfectly
able
to
do
without
new
easter
clothes
as
for
me
i
have
promised
the
lord
to
dress
better
more
like
a
human
being
and
less
like
a
and
i
intend
to
do
it
i
am
tired
of
sitting
in
retired
corners
at
parties
and
receptions
because
i
look
as
if
i
belonged
to
a
funeral
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
me
just
as
the
missionary
is
with
you
i
never
told
william
what
i
had
done
it
was
one
of
those
good
works
that
he
could
not
have
measured
or
appreciated
and
i
never
knew
whether
sister
shaller
sent
her
missionary
or
not
she
was
a
good
woman
and
perfectly
capable
of
doing
it
but
the
other
women
were
as
grateful
as
if
i
had
rescued
their
easter
things
from
a
highwayman
this
was
the
only
place
william
ever
served
where
the
people
of
the
world
flocked
in
and
filled
his
church
i
used
to
think
maybe
it
was
a
way
they
had
of
returning
my
social
friendliness
to
them
i
accepted
all
of
their
invitations
i
dared
to
accept
and
they
accepted
all
of
william
they
not
only
crowded
in
to
hear
him
preach
they
were
singularly
amiable
about
coming
up
to
the
altar
if
he
extended
an
invitation
to
penitents
who
were
sorry
for
their
sins
the
trouble
with
those
people
was
the
exceedingly
small
number
of
things
they
would
admit
were
sins
but
it
made
no
difference
in
william
exhortations
as
sometimes
he
bent
above
the
gayly
flowered
heads
in
his
altar
it
was
always
give
up
every
thing
and
follow
christ
and
if
he
did
them
no
good
certainly
he
did
them
no
harm
chapter
xii
the
cheerful
little
dog
that
led
the
blind
man
the
fact
that
i
had
a
worldly
mind
was
in
some
ways
very
fortunate
for
william
for
when
all
is
said
this
is
the
world
we
live
in
not
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
while
i
never
knew
any
man
who
understood
the
archangelic
politics
of
the
latter
place
better
than
he
did
there
were
constantly
occurring
occasions
down
here
on
the
earth
between
his
pulpit
and
the
post
office
when
this
same
new
jerusalem
statescraft
rendered
him
one
of
the
most
obtuse
and
stubborn
men
in
creation
it
was
then
that
i
used
to
feel
like
one
of
those
cheerful
clever
little
dogs
we
sometimes
see
leading
a
blind
man
through
a
dangerously
crowded
thoroughfare
it
was
then
only
that
i
ever
had
the
delightful
sensation
of
filling
the
star
rôle
in
the
really
great
drama
of
life
we
were
acting
together
and
it
was
usually
a
deliciously
double
rôle
for
william
never
knew
that
he
was
led
by
anything
but
the
voice
of
god
and
the
peculiar
scripture
wisdom
of
the
prophets
and
the
man
of
the
world
in
the
situation
who
had
to
be
corraled
and
brought
back
into
the
fold
rarely
suspected
either
what
was
happening
to
him
in
regard
to
the
latter
i
will
say
i
think
some
very
good
people
will
be
obliged
to
wait
until
they
actually
get
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
before
they
experience
the
shine
and
illumination
of
a
spiritual
nature
i
have
seen
many
a
one
of
this
class
on
william
circuits
and
they
are
about
the
most
difficult
saints
of
all
to
manage
because
they
could
do
what
they
conceived
to
be
their
duty
and
listen
a
lifetime
to
the
gospel
without
ever
catching
the
least
hint
of
its
real
significance
the
strongest
sermon
william
could
preach
on
sell
all
your
goods
and
follow
me
never
induced
a
single
rich
man
to
do
it
he
was
fortunate
if
such
a
man
gave
five
dollars
extra
to
foreign
missions
on
the
strength
of
the
appeal
the
wonderful
thing
about
william
was
that
these
facts
never
clouded
his
convictions
or
discouraged
him
he
had
a
faith
over
and
above
the
vain
pomps
and
show
of
this
world
he
wore
clothes
so
old
they
glistened
along
every
seam
and
little
thin
white
ties
and
darned
shirts
and
was
forever
stinting
himself
further
for
the
sake
of
some
collection
to
which
he
wanted
to
contribute
and
all
these
made
him
an
embarrassingly
impressive
figure
when
he
looked
out
over
the
of
his
sunday
congregation
calling
upon
them
to
sell
all
their
goods
to
feed
the
poor
or
to
lay
down
their
life
for
him
or
to
put
on
the
whole
armor
of
god
and
present
their
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
which
was
their
reasonable
service
maybe
if
he
had
especial
liberty
in
his
delivery
there
would
be
a
lively
response
of
amens
from
the
brethren
maybe
some
old
black
bonneted
sister
would
slap
her
hands
and
shout
a
little
on
the
side
but
nobody
ever
really
did
the
things
he
told
them
to
do
if
they
had
william
alone
could
have
revolutionized
human
society
in
the
course
of
his
ministry
but
he
was
never
aware
of
his
failure
he
was
like
a
man
holden
in
a
heavenly
vision
a
man
supping
in
one
long
dream
upon
the
milk
and
honey
of
far
off
canaan
for
this
reason
as
i
have
said
he
sometimes
blundered
in
the
world
about
him
and
i
had
to
come
to
the
rescue
we
were
stationed
at
arkville
a
small
village
with
two
country
churches
attached
to
make
up
the
circuit
when
this
incident
happened
which
will
serve
to
illustrate
what
i
mean
the
congregation
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
men
and
women
who
worked
in
a
cotton
factory
and
of
one
rich
man
who
owned
it
he
was
that
most
ferocious
thing
in
human
shape
a
just
man
with
a
soul
a
narrow
mind
and
a
talent
for
making
money
he
had
built
the
church
at
arkville
and
he
paid
nearly
all
the
assessments
he
was
a
despot
with
a
reputation
among
his
employees
of
having
mercy
upon
whom
he
would
have
mercy
william
never
understood
him
he
regarded
brother
sears
as
a
being
remarkably
generous
and
capable
of
growing
in
grace
sears
accordingly
flattered
and
honored
the
church
with
his
presence
every
sunday
during
the
first
six
months
of
his
ministry
but
there
came
a
dreadful
sabbath
when
william
read
for
his
new
testament
lesson
the
story
of
dives
extraordinary
prosperity
in
this
world
dwelt
with
significant
and
sympathetic
inflection
upon
the
needy
condition
of
lazarus
lying
neglected
outside
his
gate
afflicted
with
sores
then
he
capped
the
climax
after
the
singing
of
the
second
hymn
by
reading
out
in
a
deep
sonorous
voice
and
dives
being
in
torment
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
abraham
in
heaven
and
begged
for
a
drop
of
water
to
cool
his
parched
tongue
it
was
a
tropical
text
and
william
preached
a
burning
sermon
from
it
as
he
grew
older
the
vision
of
hell
seemed
to
fade
and
he
laid
the
scenes
of
his
discourses
nearer
and
nearer
the
fragrant
outskirts
of
heaven
but
he
was
now
in
his
hardy
old
age
and
occasionally
took
a
severely
good
man
obtuse
pleasure
in
picturing
the
penitentiary
pangs
of
sinners
i
shall
always
retain
a
vivid
memory
of
that
service
william
standing
in
the
little
yellow
pulpit
with
his
long
gray
beard
spread
over
his
breast
and
his
blue
eyes
shadowed
with
his
dark
thoughts
of
dives
torment
i
can
still
see
distinctly
enough
to
count
them
the
rows
of
men
and
women
with
their
hacking
concert
cough
casting
looks
of
livid
venom
at
sears
sitting
by
the
open
window
on
the
front
bench
a
great
man
who
was
regarding
the
figure
in
the
pulpit
with
such
a
blaze
of
fury
one
might
have
inferred
that
he
had
already
swallowed
a
shovelful
of
live
coals
nevertheless
william
went
on
like
an
inspired
conflagration
there
proceeded
from
his
lips
a
sulphurous
smoke
of
damaging
words
with
dives
face
appearing
and
reappearing
in
the
haze
in
a
manner
that
was
frightfully
realistic
i
longed
to
leap
to
my
feet
and
exclaim
william
stop
you
are
hurting
brother
sears
feelings
and
appealing
to
the
worst
passions
in
the
rest
of
your
congregation
but
it
was
too
late
suddenly
sears
arose
and
strode
out
of
the
house
five
minutes
later
william
closed
with
a
few
leaping
flame
sentences
and
sat
down
so
much
carried
away
with
the
sincerity
of
his
own
performance
that
he
had
not
even
noticed
sears
departure
when
he
discovered
the
sensation
he
had
created
and
the
enormity
of
his
chief
steward
indignation
he
was
far
from
repentant
he
simply
withdrew
and
devoted
an
extra
hour
a
day
to
special
prayer
for
brother
sears
it
was
no
use
to
advise
him
that
he
might
as
well
cut
off
the
electric
current
and
then
try
to
turn
on
the
light
as
to
pray
for
a
man
like
sears
he
had
a
faith
in
prayer
that
no
mere
reasoning
could
obstruct
or
circumvent
and
the
nearer
i
come
to
the
great
answer
to
all
prayers
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
he
was
right
but
in
those
days
i
almost
suspected
william
of
cheating
in
the
claims
he
made
for
the
efficacy
of
prayer
thus
in
the
case
of
brother
sears
to
all
appearances
it
was
i
who
brought
about
a
reconciliation
by
readjusting
one
of
the
little
short
circuits
of
his
perverse
nature
brothers
sears
was
a
man
who
loved
to
excel
his
even
in
the
smallest
things
he
not
only
felt
a
prominence
in
the
little
society
of
the
village
he
strove
to
surpass
the
least
person
in
it
if
there
was
any
point
of
competition
between
them
it
would
have
been
a
source
of
mortification
to
him
if
the
shoemaker
had
grown
a
larger
turnip
than
he
had
grown
william
and
i
were
walking
by
his
garden
one
day
after
he
had
sulked
for
a
month
and
saw
him
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
with
a
lordly
air
william
would
have
passed
him
by
with
a
sorrowful
bow
but
i
hailed
him
good
afternoon
brother
sears
you
have
a
beautiful
garden
but
i
believe
our
pole
beans
are
two
inches
taller
than
yours
on
the
cornstalk
he
was
all
competitive
animation
at
once
measured
the
curling
height
of
his
tallest
bean
vine
and
insisted
upon
coming
home
with
us
to
measure
ours
which
thank
heavens
were
four
inches
shorter
he
was
so
elated
over
this
victory
that
he
apparently
forgave
william
on
the
spot
for
his
dives
sermon
and
handed
him
ten
dollars
on
quarterage
to
indicate
the
return
of
his
good
will
mary
said
william
staring
down
happily
at
the
crisp
bill
in
his
hand
as
sears
disappeared
never
say
again
that
the
lord
does
not
answer
prayer
for
a
moment
i
felt
a
flash
of
resentment
who
was
it
that
had
had
the
courage
to
beard
sears
in
his
own
garden
who
had
tolled
him
all
the
way
across
town
into
our
garden
to
measure
our
bean
stalk
who
was
it
that
had
thought
up
this
method
of
natural
reconciliation
anyhow
not
william
walking
beside
us
in
sad
new
testament
silence
then
suddenly
my
crest
fell
after
all
i
was
merely
the
instrument
chosen
by
which
william
prayers
for
sears
had
been
answered
to
his
faith
we
owed
this
reaction
of
grace
not
to
me
who
had
not
uttered
a
single
petition
for
the
old
goat
from
time
to
time
william
had
queer
experiences
with
the
political
element
in
his
churches
this
is
composed
usually
not
of
bad
men
but
of
men
who
have
democratic
or
republican
immortalities
apt
as
not
the
leading
steward
would
be
the
manager
of
the
political
machine
in
that
particular
community
there
was
brother
miller
for
example
at
hartsville
a
splendid
man
with
a
strong
face
a
still
eye
and
an
impeccable
testimony
at
experience
meetings
he
held
up
william
hands
for
two
years
without
blinking
and
professed
the
greatest
benefits
from
his
sermons
no
man
could
pray
a
more
prayer
and
not
one
was
more
conscientious
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
to
the
church
and
the
pastor
it
never
seemed
to
disturb
him
that
the
portion
of
the
community
which
was
opposed
to
the
machine
that
elected
everything
from
the
village
coroner
to
the
representative
regarded
him
as
the
most
debauched
and
unscrupulous
politician
in
that
part
of
the
state
he
simply
accepted
this
as
one
of
his
crosses
bore
it
bravely
and
went
on
perfecting
his
remarkably
perfect
methods
for
excluding
all
voters
who
did
not
vote
for
his
candidate
he
would
confide
in
william
sundry
temptations
he
had
enlisted
his
sympathy
and
admiration
because
of
the
struggle
he
professed
to
have
in
regard
to
strong
drink
although
he
never
actually
touched
intoxicants
but
never
once
did
he
mention
or
admit
his
real
besetting
sin
he
was
willing
to
repent
of
everything
else
but
not
of
his
politics
and
paul
himself
could
not
have
dragged
him
across
the
democratic
party
line
in
that
county
not
even
if
he
had
showed
him
the
open
doors
of
heaven
i
do
not
know
what
is
to
become
of
such
christians
the
country
is
full
of
them
and
if
they
cause
as
many
panics
and
slumps
and
anxieties
in
the
next
world
as
they
do
in
this
one
we
shall
have
a
lot
more
trouble
there
than
we
have
been
led
to
believe
from
reading
revelations
chapter
xiii
william
wrestling
with
traveling
angels
i
have
had
little
to
say
about
the
joy
of
william
although
he
was
one
of
the
most
joyful
men
i
have
ever
known
the
reason
is
i
never
understood
it
his
joy
was
not
natural
like
mine
in
so
far
as
i
had
any
it
was
supernatural
and
not
at
all
dependent
upon
the
actual
visible
circumstance
about
him
it
used
to
frighten
me
sometimes
to
face
the
last
month
before
quarterly
conference
with
only
two
dollars
half
a
sack
of
flour
and
the
hock
end
of
a
ham
but
then
it
was
that
william
rose
to
the
heights
of
a
strange
and
almost
exasperating
cheerfulness
he
could
see
where
he
was
going
plainer
our
extremity
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
trust
more
in
the
miracles
of
providence
and
that
afforded
him
the
greatest
pleasure
he
was
never
weary
of
putting
his
faith
to
the
test
he
was
like
a
strong
wrestling
jacob
going
about
looking
for
new
angels
to
conquer
and
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
his
lord
never
really
failed
him
although
he
sometimes
came
within
five
minutes
of
doing
so
one
sabbath
i
remember
he
had
an
appointment
at
a
church
ten
miles
distant
where
he
was
to
begin
a
protracted
meeting
at
the
last
moment
his
horse
went
lame
it
so
happened
that
some
weeks
previous
william
had
overreached
himself
in
a
horse
trade
he
had
swapped
an
irritable
mare
for
a
very
handsome
animal
who
proved
to
have
a
gravel
in
one
of
his
fore
feet
this
horse
would
lay
his
tail
over
the
dashboard
and
travel
like
inspiration
for
days
at
a
time
up
and
down
the
long
country
roads
then
suddenly
if
there
was
a
hurried
message
to
go
somewhere
to
comfort
a
dying
man
or
preach
his
funeral
the
creature
would
begin
to
limp
as
if
he
never
expected
to
use
but
three
legs
again
i
believe
william
suspected
the
devil
had
something
to
do
with
this
diabolical
gravel
for
he
never
gave
way
to
impatience
as
a
natural
man
would
have
done
in
such
a
predicament
upon
the
occasion
i
have
mentioned
he
helped
the
old
hypocrite
back
into
the
stable
with
a
mildness
that
exasperated
me
as
i
watched
with
my
hat
on
from
the
window
for
it
was
already
past
the
time
when
we
should
have
started
silas
is
too
lame
to
travel
said
he
a
moment
later
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
but
what
will
you
do
william
i
exclaimed
provoked
in
spite
of
myself
at
his
serenity
it
will
be
dreadful
if
you
miss
your
appointment
at
the
beginning
of
the
meeting
i
can
do
nothing
but
pray
mine
is
the
lord
work
doubtless
he
will
provide
a
way
for
me
to
get
to
it
he
answered
withdrawing
into
the
parlor
and
closing
the
door
after
him
i
knew
that
meant
wrestling
with
one
of
the
traveling
angels
and
held
my
tongue
but
the
natural
temper
in
my
blood
was
not
so
easily
controlled
i
flopped
down
in
the
chair
laid
my
head
upon
the
window
sill
and
yielded
to
tears
i
was
far
along
in
my
middle
years
then
but
never
to
the
end
did
i
get
accustomed
to
the
stubbornness
of
william
faith
i
always
wanted
to
do
something
literal
and
effective
myself
in
the
emergency
i
seemed
to
be
made
so
that
i
could
look
to
god
for
help
until
i
had
worn
myself
out
while
i
sat
there
in
a
sort
of
tearful
rage
with
william
and
the
horse
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
at
the
front
gate
i
arose
hastily
wiping
my
eyes
and
was
just
in
time
to
face
william
smiling
countenance
in
the
parlor
doorway
mary
sister
spindle
is
not
well
and
brother
spindle
has
driven
by
to
offer
us
seats
in
his
carriage
brother
spindle
was
the
only
man
in
the
community
who
owned
a
carriage
and
horses
i
flung
my
arms
around
william
neck
and
whispered
forgive
me
william
i
never
can
get
used
to
it
that
the
lord
is
illogically
and
incredibly
good
to
you
but
i
am
glad
to
tag
along
after
you
in
his
mercies
he
had
a
gentle
way
of
enjoying
these
triumphs
over
me
he
would
cast
the
blue
beam
of
his
eye
humorously
over
me
and
then
kiss
me
as
if
i
was
still
young
and
beautiful
never
in
all
our
married
life
did
he
get
the
best
of
me
in
an
argument
his
arguing
faculty
was
not
highly
developed
it
was
easier
to
silence
him
than
to
stir
him
into
opposing
speech
but
whenever
he
entered
the
sacred
parsonage
parlor
and
closed
the
door
after
him
i
always
knew
he
would
have
the
best
of
me
one
way
or
another
when
he
came
out
but
it
was
not
this
faith
in
prayer
that
confused
me
most
it
was
the
answers
that
william
and
others
like
him
received
to
their
prayers
we
never
went
to
any
church
where
there
was
not
at
least
one
man
or
woman
who
knew
actually
knew
how
to
reach
his
or
her
empty
hands
up
to
god
and
get
them
filled
and
they
were
always
people
of
rare
dignity
in
the
community
although
some
of
them
bordered
on
the
simplicity
of
childhood
mentally
i
recall
in
this
connection
sister
carleton
she
was
a
very
old
woman
who
seemed
to
have
settled
down
to
be
mostly
below
her
waist
her
shoulders
were
thin
her
bosom
flat
but
she
widened
out
in
the
hips
amazingly
her
face
was
the
most
beautifully
wrinkled
countenance
i
ever
beheld
every
line
seemed
to
enhance
some
celestial
quality
in
her
expression
and
she
had
the
dim
look
of
the
very
old
after
they
begin
to
recede
spiritually
from
the
ruthlessness
of
mere
realities
she
had
palsy
and
used
to
sit
in
the
amen
corner
of
the
church
at
eureka
gently
incessantly
wagging
her
lovely
old
head
beneath
a
little
black
horseshoe
bonnet
that
was
tied
under
her
chin
with
long
black
ribbons
sabbath
after
sabbath
year
after
year
she
was
always
to
be
seen
there
sweetly
abstracted
like
an
old
saint
in
a
dream
she
had
one
thought
one
purpose
left
in
life
this
was
to
live
to
see
all
of
her
boys
saved
these
were
three
men
all
of
whom
had
been
wild
in
their
youth
her
one
connection
now
with
the
church
was
expressed
not
by
any
personal
interest
in
the
preacher
or
his
sermons
but
in
this
thought
for
her
children
some
time
during
every
experience
meeting
we
always
knew
that
sister
carleton
would
rise
trembling
to
her
feet
steady
herself
with
both
hands
on
the
bench
in
front
of
her
look
about
her
vaguely
and
ask
the
prayers
of
all
christian
people
that
her
boys
might
repent
and
be
saved
from
their
sins
they
were
already
excellent
and
prosperous
citizens
and
remarkable
for
their
devotion
to
her
but
she
was
not
the
woman
to
mince
matters
they
had
not
been
converted
therefore
she
prayed
for
them
as
if
they
were
still
dead
in
their
trespasses
and
sins
the
first
year
of
william
ministry
in
this
place
the
two
younger
sons
were
converted
and
joined
the
church
but
the
oldest
still
held
out
as
the
saying
was
in
fact
he
stayed
out
of
the
church
literally
never
coming
to
any
service
the
next
year
sister
carleton
had
grown
very
feeble
but
at
a
consecration
meeting
held
one
afternoon
before
the
regular
revival
service
at
night
she
appeared
as
usual
before
the
closing
hymn
she
arose
clasped
her
old
hands
over
the
back
of
the
bench
in
front
of
her
and
made
her
last
petition
for
the
prayers
of
all
christian
people
brother
thompson
she
concluded
in
the
deep
raucous
voice
of
extreme
age
i
have
prayed
for
my
youngest
boy
fifty
years
and
for
my
second
boy
years
and
for
my
oldest
son
nearly
sixty
years
the
two
youngest
air
saved
now
but
is
still
out
of
the
fold
i
losin
faith
but
i
gittin
tired
seems
as
if
i
could
hold
out
much
longer
but
i
ca
go
till
jimmy
is
saved
i
ai
got
else
keepin
me
but
that
she
paused
looked
about
her
as
if
she
felt
a
memory
brush
past
when
he
was
jest
a
little
one
no
higher
that
he
was
afeerd
of
the
dark
i
always
had
to
set
by
him
till
he
was
asleep
and
now
seems
as
if
i
could
leave
him
for
good
out
in
the
dark
i
want
to
ast
you
to
pray
not
that
he
may
be
converted
but
that
he
may
be
converted
this
very
night
i
ai
got
time
to
wait
no
longer
seems
as
if
i
jest
obliged
to
git
still
and
rest
soon
she
sank
back
upon
the
bench
and
i
wondered
what
william
would
do
i
never
was
prepared
for
the
audacity
of
his
faith
but
that
was
one
kind
of
dare
he
never
took
sister
carleton
he
replied
i
feel
that
your
prayer
will
be
answered
i
got
the
faith
to
believe
your
son
will
come
here
tonight
and
be
saved
from
his
sins
i
wished
that
he
had
not
been
so
definite
i
felt
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
give
some
general
expression
of
hope
i
feared
the
effects
upon
the
rest
of
the
congregation
and
upon
william
when
we
returned
for
the
night
service
and
james
carleton
should
not
be
there
even
and
i
was
sure
he
would
not
be
i
reckon
first
and
last
i
must
have
halved
the
strength
of
william
faith
by
my
lack
of
faith
the
truth
is
so
bold
so
absurd
from
the
present
worldly
point
of
view
that
i
almost
hesitate
to
write
it
here
james
carleton
was
present
at
the
evening
service
he
was
the
first
man
to
reach
the
altar
when
the
invitation
to
penitents
was
given
he
was
soundly
converted
and
lived
a
changed
life
from
that
hour
the
next
night
sister
carleton
was
not
in
her
accustomed
place
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
forty
years
a
month
later
she
passed
away
having
already
received
the
joy
of
her
reward
in
the
salvation
of
her
children
i
have
noticed
that
rich
people
do
not
have
this
kind
of
faith
in
prayer
they
want
as
a
rule
only
those
things
that
can
be
bought
with
money
and
they
buy
them
i
have
never
seen
a
rich
father
nearly
so
anxious
for
the
salvation
of
his
children
as
he
was
for
their
success
in
the
world
and
the
same
thing
has
been
my
observation
in
regard
to
rich
mothers
sometimes
they
pray
for
their
sons
and
daughters
but
they
do
not
often
mean
what
they
pray
and
god
knows
it
for
he
never
horrifies
one
of
them
by
granting
their
prayer
still
there
is
a
kind
of
sacrilegious
confidence
in
prayer
that
always
offended
some
delicacy
in
me
and
william
felt
it
too
only
he
never
learned
how
to
condemn
it
his
sense
of
reverence
was
not
sufficiently
discriminating
and
there
was
an
occasion
where
i
had
to
rid
him
and
his
congregation
of
this
sublimated
form
of
spiritual
indecency
as
i
have
said
we
were
sent
now
to
small
stations
village
churches
or
mission
churches
in
the
factory
edges
of
the
big
cities
but
william
years
the
hardships
and
anxieties
both
earthly
and
unearthly
to
which
he
had
been
exposed
began
to
tell
on
his
strength
and
the
year
we
were
at
springdale
as
the
summer
came
on
he
felt
unequal
to
conducting
the
usual
six
weeks
protracted
meeting
without
help
and
while
six
weeks
may
seem
a
long
time
to
hold
such
services
it
is
really
a
very
short
time
for
people
to
get
revived
and
in
when
all
the
rest
of
the
year
they
have
been
otherwise
minded
the
wonder
to
me
was
that
men
who
had
driven
hard
bargains
and
hated
some
one
or
more
neighbors
for
ten
months
that
women
who
had
given
themselves
over
to
the
littleness
and
lightness
of
a
small
fashionable
life
in
a
small
town
or
to
gossip
about
those
who
did
could
so
quickly
recover
their
moral
and
spiritual
standards
in
a
revival
i
remember
that
it
was
william
custom
as
soon
as
there
was
the
least
interest
manifested
to
have
a
very
searching
service
for
his
church
members
in
which
he
called
upon
all
those
who
were
at
enmity
with
one
another
to
rectify
whatever
wrong
they
had
committed
and
to
be
reconciled
nearly
always
some
steward
had
had
a
row
with
somebody
else
apt
as
not
a
sinner
he
would
be
expected
to
go
out
and
find
the
man
whoever
it
was
and
patch
up
the
difficulty
and
to
report
at
the
next
service
i
can
see
now
the
old
spiritual
in
william
congregations
with
whom
year
in
and
year
out
he
had
the
greatest
trouble
they
always
managed
to
fall
out
with
somebody
between
revivals
but
nothing
in
or
out
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
would
make
one
of
them
admit
he
was
in
the
wrong
or
induce
him
to
go
to
the
other
person
and
attempt
a
reconciliation
the
most
you
could
get
out
of
any
one
of
them
would
be
that
if
his
enemy
came
to
him
and
asked
his
pardon
he
was
willing
to
forgive
him
if
the
said
enemy
was
a
good
natured
fellow
william
usually
managed
to
get
him
to
make
this
concession
otherwise
the
old
remained
cold
and
aggrieved
through
out
the
revival
maybe
casting
a
damper
over
the
whole
meeting
a
figure
in
the
amen
corner
at
which
the
young
unregenerated
sinners
would
point
the
finger
of
scorn
and
accusation
when
they
were
implored
to
repent
and
believe
and
behave
themselves
no
one
who
has
not
been
through
it
can
understand
how
heartbreaking
all
this
is
to
the
preacher
and
how
wearing
on
his
human
nerves
there
have
been
times
when
i
should
have
been
almost
willing
to
see
william
lose
patience
and
expend
about
two
pages
of
fierce
plutonian
vocabulary
on
some
old
in
the
church
but
he
never
did
and
it
will
serve
them
right
if
the
ten
thousand
prayers
he
made
asking
god
to
soften
their
obdurate
hearts
are
registered
against
them
somewhere
in
the
debit
column
of
the
book
of
life
thus
i
say
it
came
to
pass
that
william
was
wearing
out
and
no
longer
able
to
get
through
a
protracted
meeting
alone
so
at
springdale
he
engaged
brother
dunn
to
come
and
help
him
brother
dunn
was
what
may
be
called
a
professional
evangelist
we
had
never
seen
him
but
he
had
a
reputation
for
being
wonderfully
successful
with
sinners
and
if
sinners
made
a
ripe
harvest
springdale
was
as
much
in
need
of
reapers
as
any
place
we
had
ever
been
you
might
have
inferred
that
the
original
forbidden
flourished
in
the
midst
of
it
the
people
were
so
given
to
frank
straightforward
sinning
of
the
most
naïvely
primitive
character
i
never
knew
how
william
felt
but
i
was
not
favorably
impressed
with
brother
dunn
when
he
arrived
on
the
late
evening
train
a
frisky
dapper
young
man
who
looked
in
the
face
as
if
his
light
was
turned
too
high
that
night
as
he
preceded
us
up
the
aisle
of
the
church
which
was
crowded
to
hear
him
he
showed
to
my
mind
a
sort
of
irreverent
confidence
in
the
grace
of
god
the
service
that
followed
was
indescribable
in
any
religious
language
or
even
in
any
secular
language
brother
dunn
brought
his
own
with
him
and
distributed
them
in
the
congregation
with
an
activity
and
conversational
freedom
that
made
him
acquainted
at
once
the
hymns
proved
to
be
nursery
rhymes
of
salvation
set
to
what
may
be
described
as
lightly
spinning
music
anybody
could
sing
them
and
everybody
did
and
the
more
they
sang
the
more
cheerful
they
looked
but
not
repentant
the
service
was
composed
mostly
of
these
songs
interspersed
now
and
then
with
wildly
excruciating
exhortations
from
brother
dunn
to
repent
and
believe
he
explained
with
an
occasional
ha
ha
how
easy
it
was
to
do
and
there
is
no
denying
that
the
altar
was
filled
with
confused
young
people
who
knelt
and
hid
their
eyes
and
behaved
with
singular
reverence
under
the
circumstances
the
cheating
began
when
brother
dunn
attempted
to
make
them
claim
the
blessing
he
induced
half
a
dozen
young
girls
and
two
or
three
youths
to
stand
up
and
testify
that
their
sins
had
been
forgiven
simple
young
creatures
who
had
no
more
sense
of
the
nature
of
sin
or
the
depth
of
genuine
repentance
than
field
larks
later
he
frisked
home
with
us
praising
god
in
little
foolish
words
and
rejoicing
over
the
success
of
the
service
shortly
after
he
retired
to
his
room
we
heard
a
great
commotion
punctuated
with
staccato
shouts
william
hurried
to
the
door
to
inquire
what
the
trouble
was
he
discovered
brother
dunn
hopping
about
the
room
in
his
slapping
his
palms
together
in
a
religious
frenzy
he
declared
that
as
he
prayed
by
his
bed
a
light
had
appeared
beside
him
william
tried
to
look
cheerful
and
blessed
but
there
is
one
thing
i
can
always
say
for
him
he
was
an
honest
man
in
dealing
with
the
most
illusive
and
deceptive
things
men
have
ever
dealt
in
that
is
spiritual
values
and
the
more
he
observed
brother
dunn
the
more
his
misgivings
increased
the
next
morning
i
met
the
evangelist
in
the
hall
hallelujah
he
exclaimed
what
for
i
demanded
coldly
he
gave
some
stammering
reply
but
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
his
spiritual
peace
in
our
house
after
that
i
consistently
punctured
his
ecstasies
quoting
some
of
the
sternest
scriptures
i
could
remember
to
confound
him
william
remonstrated
with
me
he
said
dunn
said
my
lack
of
spirituality
depressed
him
and
william
his
lack
of
reverence
incenses
me
if
you
do
get
rid
of
that
cotton
haloed
evangelist
everybody
in
this
town
will
claim
a
without
repenting
or
being
converted
i
replied
fortunately
dunn
dismissed
himself
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
a
revival
in
such
an
atmosphere
he
implied
as
plainly
as
he
could
that
he
was
sorry
for
william
accepted
the
sum
of
ten
dollars
which
had
been
promised
him
for
his
services
and
left
i
have
never
known
what
to
think
of
such
preachers
no
one
who
ever
knew
one
can
doubt
his
sincerity
but
they
cultivate
a
kind
of
spiritual
idiocy
and
frenzy
that
is
more
damaging
to
souls
than
any
amount
of
hypocrisy
i
have
always
been
thankful
that
the
joy
of
william
in
the
religious
life
was
a
stern
and
great
thing
no
more
resembling
this
lightness
this
flippancy
than
integrity
resembles
folly
chapter
xiv
curious
facts
about
the
nature
of
a
priest
what
we
call
history
is
a
sorry
part
of
literature
confined
to
a
few
great
wars
and
movements
in
national
life
and
to
the
important
events
in
the
lives
of
a
few
important
people
the
common
man
has
never
starred
his
rôle
in
it
therefore
it
has
never
been
written
according
to
the
scientific
method
it
is
simply
the
spray
the
big
splash
humanity
throws
up
as
it
goes
down
in
the
sea
forever
it
is
what
most
of
us
do
and
what
we
think
perishes
with
us
leaving
not
a
record
behind
of
the
little
daily
deeds
and
wingflappings
of
our
spirits
that
really
make
us
what
we
are
this
is
why
we
make
so
little
progress
the
history
of
the
great
majority
is
never
compiled
for
reference
we
are
always
bunched
in
a
paragraph
while
the
rest
of
the
chapter
is
given
to
his
excellency
the
president
or
some
other
momentary
figure
of
the
times
nobody
knows
exactly
how
the
planters
of
thomas
jefferson
day
lived
we
must
depend
upon
fiction
to
give
a
sort
of
romantic
impression
of
it
and
fifty
years
from
now
no
one
will
know
how
the
farmers
and
brickmasons
grocers
and
merchants
managed
their
affairs
in
our
own
times
we
shall
be
obliged
to
accept
the
sensational
accounts
left
by
a
few
socialists
i
do
not
know
that
i
ought
to
pretend
to
rescue
the
class
to
which
william
belonged
from
the
same
kind
of
oblivion
but
by
keeping
memories
of
the
little
daily
things
in
life
a
preacher
wife
learns
some
curious
facts
about
the
nature
of
a
priest
facts
that
should
enable
the
reader
to
make
profitable
comparisons
between
those
of
the
old
and
those
of
the
new
order
and
to
determine
which
is
the
real
minister
and
which
is
not
one
thing
i
discovered
was
that
you
can
not
domesticate
a
preacher
like
william
on
this
earth
in
this
life
a
woman
might
get
married
to
him
and
hang
like
a
kissing
millstone
about
his
neck
she
might
sew
on
his
buttons
bear
children
for
him
teach
him
to
eat
rolled
oats
surround
him
with
every
evidence
privilege
and
obligation
of
strong
earthly
ties
and
a
home
but
he
will
not
live
there
in
his
spirit
he
belongs
neither
to
his
wife
nor
to
his
children
nor
to
the
civilization
of
his
times
he
belongs
to
god
and
not
to
a
god
tamed
and
diminished
by
modern
thought
but
to
the
god
the
one
who
divided
the
light
from
darkness
who
actually
did
create
adam
and
eve
and
blow
his
breath
into
them
who
accepted
burnt
offerings
sometimes
and
who
caused
flowers
to
bloom
upon
the
same
altars
between
times
so
william
never
really
belonged
in
his
own
house
with
his
own
body
his
own
wife
and
his
breakfast
though
he
often
rested
there
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
latter
he
was
more
at
home
in
the
psalms
i
will
not
say
he
went
so
far
as
jehovah
but
when
he
was
in
a
leviticus
frame
of
mind
very
few
of
the
minor
prophets
satisfied
his
cravings
for
the
awful
the
gentle
springtime
of
his
heart
was
when
he
took
up
with
saint
john
in
the
new
testament
he
never
professed
the
intimate
i
have
heard
some
conceited
preachers
express
for
saint
paul
he
was
not
a
great
man
he
was
just
a
good
one
and
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
thrust
himself
upon
a
big
saint
like
paul
even
in
his
imagination
and
i
do
not
know
which
has
been
the
greatest
influence
in
making
me
what
i
am
the
sense
of
reverence
i
had
for
him
and
his
high
bible
company
or
the
sense
of
bereavement
i
had
when
having
fed
him
and
warmed
him
he
was
still
not
at
home
with
me
but
following
some
pillar
of
cloud
in
his
thoughts
toward
his
great
god
far
eternity
a
woman
is
a
very
poor
creature
i
think
she
hankers
more
for
just
love
than
she
does
for
heaven
i
do
know
how
she
will
get
on
in
a
place
where
there
is
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
it
bound
to
be
hard
on
her
if
the
lord
does
not
give
her
something
more
than
a
harp
and
a
golden
crown
with
which
to
fill
the
aching
void
she
is
sure
to
have
somewhere
under
her
breast
feathers
but
no
one
can
say
that
i
did
not
stand
by
william
through
the
entire
widowhood
of
my
marriage
i
was
the
world
compass
of
his
life
always
sitting
in
his
amen
corner
with
my
attention
fixed
anxiously
upon
the
spiritual
pulse
of
the
congregation
always
giving
him
the
most
nourishing
food
our
limited
means
afforded
always
standing
between
him
and
sordid
dickering
with
the
butcher
and
candlestick
maker
always
making
myself
a
chinese
wall
to
separate
him
on
days
from
the
church
public
many
a
time
i
have
taken
my
hands
out
of
the
biscuit
dough
to
meet
a
steward
who
was
determined
to
see
him
about
the
increased
foreign
mission
assessment
or
it
might
be
the
superintendent
come
to
discuss
the
may
picnic
i
could
usually
pacify
the
steward
and
put
off
the
superintendent
but
if
it
was
a
messenger
from
some
remote
neighborhood
on
the
circuit
come
to
say
that
brother
beatem
was
dead
and
the
family
wanted
brother
thompson
to
conduct
the
funeral
services
next
morning
at
the
nearest
methodist
church
i
would
be
obliged
to
give
in
even
if
william
was
in
the
very
heat
of
spiritual
constructions
for
a
funeral
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
put
off
the
corpse
will
not
endure
it
nor
the
family
either
for
that
matter
they
want
the
preacher
to
be
on
hand
promptly
with
all
the
laurels
of
language
to
bestow
upon
their
dead
in
the
funeral
wreath
discourse
and
this
brings
me
to
mention
a
peculiarity
of
surviving
relatives
as
a
class
they
demand
that
the
pastor
of
the
dead
man
or
woman
shall
furnish
him
his
titles
to
mansions
in
the
sky
whether
he
deserves
them
or
not
even
if
brother
beatem
was
a
mean
man
who
neglected
his
wife
and
children
cheated
his
neighbors
abused
his
horse
and
failed
to
support
the
church
he
must
have
a
funeral
that
praised
him
for
a
saint
and
if
the
pastor
failed
to
do
this
the
surviving
relatives
whom
the
dead
man
had
victimized
every
day
he
lived
would
be
the
first
to
resent
it
i
never
knew
but
one
pastor
who
told
the
truth
in
a
funeral
sermon
and
he
had
to
be
moved
immediately
by
his
presiding
elder
the
whole
community
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
most
brutal
outrages
that
had
ever
been
perpetrated
in
their
midst
as
for
william
there
was
something
sublime
in
the
way
he
permitted
his
mind
to
skip
the
facts
and
stir
his
imagination
when
he
preached
a
funeral
the
curious
part
of
it
was
he
believed
what
he
said
and
generally
by
the
time
he
had
finished
nearly
everyone
else
believed
it
there
were
occasions
of
course
when
he
was
disgracefully
duped
by
the
surviving
relatives
however
i
pass
over
a
thousand
little
epitaphs
of
memory
and
come
to
our
last
years
in
the
itinerancy
and
it
is
curious
how
life
winds
itself
into
a
circle
like
the
trail
a
lost
man
makes
in
the
desert
after
a
few
years
as
pastor
of
village
churches
william
was
sent
back
to
the
country
circuits
he
was
failing
some
and
of
course
younger
and
more
progressive
men
were
needed
in
the
villages
preachers
who
could
keep
up
with
the
times
in
modern
church
life
and
i
am
obliged
to
admit
william
was
a
poor
church
committeeman
occasionally
he
would
go
off
to
see
an
old
sick
woman
or
some
barren
man
who
was
not
even
a
member
of
the
church
and
forget
all
about
an
important
committee
meeting
on
the
brotherhood
of
man
this
would
give
offense
to
some
of
the
people
in
the
church
who
in
turn
would
complain
that
he
was
not
sufficiently
interested
in
spreading
the
gospel
as
i
have
said
before
william
was
a
good
man
but
he
was
neither
brilliant
nor
enterprising
as
we
understand
these
terms
nowadays
he
never
did
get
it
into
his
head
that
salvation
could
be
furnished
a
dying
world
through
a
thorough
organization
of
it
into
committees
that
furnished
not
only
the
salvation
but
also
the
goat
districts
which
had
to
receive
this
salvation
as
fast
as
it
was
offered
it
was
as
simple
as
commerce
and
as
naïve
as
a
rich
man
charity
but
william
see
it
somehow
he
was
secretly
opposed
to
it
he
was
for
catching
every
goat
separately
and
feeding
him
on
truth
and
tenderness
till
he
turned
into
a
lamb
it
was
no
use
to
argue
that
this
required
too
much
time
and
would
take
an
eternity
to
get
the
world
ready
for
heaven
he
refused
to
think
of
immortal
souls
as
if
they
were
bunches
of
heathen
cattle
or
slum
cattle
that
must
be
got
into
the
salvation
market
on
the
hoof
as
soon
as
possible
as
he
grew
older
more
set
in
his
ways
he
became
a
trifle
contrary
about
it
like
a
thorny
old
priest
who
has
received
private
orders
from
his
god
to
go
on
seeking
his
lost
lambs
one
at
a
time
once
he
insulted
a
man
who
came
to
him
about
the
laymen
movement
which
is
organized
to
convert
the
world
to
christianity
in
this
generation
and
probably
before
christmas
we
can
do
it
if
we
have
faith
enough
said
he
no
you
ca
retorted
william
not
unless
the
heathens
get
faith
enough
to
believe
and
faith
is
a
thing
you
can
not
send
out
through
the
mails
as
if
it
was
sample
packages
of
patent
medicine
such
talk
as
that
sent
him
back
to
the
circuits
where
there
were
the
same
old
fashions
in
sleeves
and
headgear
for
women
and
where
he
could
take
his
text
from
jonah
gourd
if
he
chose
without
exciting
the
higher
critical
faculties
of
his
congregation
it
was
harder
on
us
in
some
ways
i
never
could
understand
why
the
old
preachers
who
have
got
rheumatism
in
their
knees
and
maybe
lumbago
besides
should
be
sent
back
to
the
exposure
of
all
weathers
on
the
circuits
while
the
young
ones
with
plenty
of
oil
in
their
joints
fatten
in
the
more
comfortable
charges
and
i
am
not
the
one
to
say
with
resignation
that
it
is
all
right
still
the
good
god
evens
things
up
in
wonderful
ways
william
got
so
stiff
in
his
legs
toward
the
last
that
he
had
to
stand
up
to
pray
but
we
had
come
back
to
the
region
of
simplicities
where
there
were
just
three
elements
to
consider
and
put
together
in
his
sermons
man
his
field
and
his
god
and
they
were
only
separated
by
a
little
grass
a
few
stars
and
the
creation
light
and
darkness
of
days
and
nights
when
a
man
gets
as
near
home
as
that
he
does
not
mind
the
pains
in
his
mere
body
at
least
william
never
complained
looking
back
i
think
he
was
at
his
best
about
the
time
he
went
back
to
the
real
circuit
itinerancy
he
had
the
glory
of
presence
faith
i
think
gave
him
a
halo
you
could
not
see
it
but
you
could
feel
it
and
in
this
connection
i
recall
an
illustration
of
the
difference
between
such
a
halo
and
the
aura
we
hear
so
much
about
these
days
from
people
who
think
they
are
interested
in
psychic
phenomena
but
who
are
really
psychic
epileptics
we
were
on
a
circuit
which
included
a
summer
resort
and
the
varieties
of
diseases
among
patients
in
a
sanitarium
are
as
nothing
compared
to
the
mental
moral
spiritual
and
physical
disorders
to
be
found
among
the
class
who
frequent
springs
to
this
place
came
a
new
thoughter
who
was
always
in
a
spiritual
sweat
about
her
astral
shape
she
manifested
a
condescending
interest
in
the
sunday
services
at
our
church
which
finally
led
her
to
call
on
william
one
afternoon
at
the
parsonage
she
was
a
dingy
little
blonde
with
a
tight
forehead
and
a
thin
nose
william
was
sitting
alone
in
the
peace
of
his
spirit
behind
the
vines
on
the
front
porch
providence
had
wisely
removed
me
to
the
inside
the
adjoining
room
the
sense
of
humor
in
me
has
never
been
converted
and
there
were
occasions
when
it
was
best
for
me
not
to
be
too
literally
present
when
william
was
examining
the
spiritual
condition
of
some
puzzled
soul
he
had
risen
and
provided
her
with
a
chair
and
sat
down
opposite
regarding
her
with
a
hospitable
blue
beam
in
his
eyes
she
had
the
fatal
facility
for
innocuous
expression
common
to
her
class
all
the
time
i
knew
william
was
waiting
like
an
experienced
fisherman
for
a
chance
to
swing
his
net
on
her
side
of
the
boat
the
poor
man
did
not
dream
that
she
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
persons
who
has
swapped
her
real
soul
for
a
hindu
vagary
but
presently
she
let
it
out
thompson
she
continued
without
a
rhetorical
pause
to
indicate
the
decimal
points
between
her
thoughts
i
was
interested
in
what
you
said
about
immortality
last
sunday
now
i
wonder
if
you
know
it
is
an
actual
fact
that
by
breathing
rhythmically
thirty
times
counting
three
while
you
inhale
three
while
you
exhale
and
three
while
you
hold
your
breath
you
can
actually
get
into
touch
at
once
with
your
astral
shape
william
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
his
glasses
deliberately
put
them
on
and
then
regarded
her
over
the
steel
rims
i
could
see
the
jehovah
crest
of
his
spirit
erect
itself
as
he
replied
with
divine
dignity
madam
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
your
astral
shape
but
i
do
not
have
to
pant
like
a
lizard
to
keep
in
touch
with
my
soul
but
she
bore
with
him
showing
far
more
calmness
than
he
as
she
went
on
to
describe
the
wonderful
power
of
spirit
she
had
developed
she
had
even
gone
so
far
she
said
as
a
matter
of
experiment
to
put
her
thought
upon
the
unborn
child
of
a
friend
and
when
the
child
came
it
was
not
like
its
own
mother
or
father
but
her
exact
image
now
she
declared
she
was
sure
it
was
her
own
thought
child
and
what
was
more
convincing
still
she
had
at
last
attained
to
a
aura
she
added
this
with
an
indescribable
air
of
triumph
william
tightened
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
drew
his
face
close
and
stared
at
her
with
the
sort
of
scandalized
sunsmile
moses
must
have
worn
the
first
time
he
caught
sight
of
the
golden
calf
madam
he
exclaimed
after
a
dreadful
inquisitive
silence
i
can
see
no
signs
of
an
aura
either
blue
or
otherwise
but
if
you
actually
did
try
to
steal
another
woman
child
with
your
thoughts
you
have
been
guilty
of
an
unimaginable
meanness
and
you
should
go
down
on
your
knees
to
almighty
god
for
forgiveness
but
william
was
never
at
his
best
when
he
was
brought
into
contrast
morally
or
intellectually
with
the
temporary
illusions
of
modern
times
they
cast
him
out
of
drawing
and
gave
him
a
look
of
the
grotesque
as
a
great
and
solemn
figure
on
a
vaudeville
stage
suggests
the
comical
he
belonged
to
a
time
when
the
scriptures
of
men
hearts
had
not
suffered
the
moderation
and
sacrilege
of
the
sense
of
humor
he
had
a
mind
illumined
with
the
old
eden
figures
of
speech
and
loved
to
refer
to
the
thick
bosses
of
jehovah
buckler
there
were
occasions
indeed
when
i
could
not
preserve
a
proper
inner
reverence
for
his
favorite
hymns
as
for
example
when
he
would
be
standing
during
a
revival
season
behind
an
altar
heavily
laden
with
dying
souls
who
had
come
up
for
prayers
in
order
to
interpret
for
them
a
proper
frame
of
mind
he
would
sometimes
choose
one
of
famous
hymns
he
would
stand
with
his
feet
wide
apart
his
fingers
interlaced
palms
downward
eyes
lifted
in
anguished
supplication
and
sing
in
his
great
organ
bass
inspire
a
feeble
worm
to
rush
into
thy
kingdom
lord
and
take
it
as
by
storm
still
if
you
do
not
dwell
upon
the
vision
of
the
suddenly
valorous
worm
the
words
express
a
higher
form
of
courage
than
that
denoted
in
matthew
arnold
famous
poem
the
last
word
and
i
have
seen
many
a
worm
rise
shouting
from
the
altar
rail
under
their
inspired
meaning
the
sense
of
humor
has
in
my
opinion
very
little
to
do
with
poetry
or
salvation
it
belongs
entirely
to
the
critical
human
faculties
and
i
have
found
it
one
of
the
greatest
limitations
in
my
own
spiritual
development
and
as
time
went
on
i
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
this
was
an
evidence
of
a
lower
imaginative
faculty
in
me
rather
than
in
him
he
had
less
humor
but
he
had
infinitely
more
of
the
grace
that
belongs
to
immortality
he
had
a
spirit
that
withstood
adversity
hardship
failure
with
a
sort
of
ancient
dignity
and
that
could
face
tragedy
with
promethean
fortitude
and
i
love
best
to
think
of
him
in
relation
to
the
bare
and
awful
sorrows
that
show
so
nakedly
in
the
lives
of
poor
simple
folk
i
can
see
him
now
in
the
dismal
twilight
of
one
winter
evening
as
he
started
on
that
strange
mission
to
martin
looking
like
an
old
weatherbeaten
angel
breasting
a
storm
the
wide
brim
of
his
black
hat
flared
up
from
his
face
in
the
wind
his
long
gray
beard
was
blown
over
the
shoulders
of
his
greatcoat
he
had
started
without
his
muffler
i
ran
out
to
fetch
it
and
winding
it
about
his
neck
i
saw
the
blue
bloom
of
heaven
in
his
eyes
that
always
turned
young
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
roll
the
stones
away
from
the
door
of
some
sinner
heart
william
i
cried
it
going
to
be
an
awful
night
do
go
she
is
not
a
member
of
your
church
illustration
it
going
to
be
an
awful
night
do
go
she
is
not
a
member
of
your
church
nor
of
any
other
but
she
is
all
the
more
in
need
of
help
he
replied
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
to
mount
his
horse
martin
was
a
vague
little
woman
superstitious
about
dreams
a
widow
who
lived
with
her
two
small
children
in
a
neighborhood
about
a
stone
quarry
the
day
before
the
community
had
been
shocked
to
learn
from
some
one
who
happened
in
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
tragedy
that
martin
had
gone
suddenly
insane
and
had
tried
to
murder
both
of
her
children
she
must
go
to
the
asylum
of
course
but
pending
the
preliminary
trial
for
lunacy
she
lay
silent
on
her
bed
with
staring
horrified
eyes
surrounded
by
watchful
neighbors
suddenly
toward
night
she
had
grown
restless
and
had
implored
them
to
send
for
the
methodist
preacher
to
quiet
her
the
messenger
had
come
and
william
made
haste
to
go
to
her
he
found
her
sitting
the
very
figure
of
desolation
in
the
midst
of
her
bed
with
her
face
thinned
and
whitened
to
the
little
white
hull
of
a
prayer
the
moment
she
was
alone
with
him
she
poured
forth
such
a
tale
of
degradation
as
rarely
passes
the
lips
of
a
woman
since
a
year
after
her
husband
death
she
had
been
the
mistress
of
the
manager
of
the
quarry
she
had
lived
in
the
most
atrocious
debauchery
for
years
no
one
had
suspected
and
she
had
not
suffered
a
qualm
but
two
nights
since
she
had
gone
to
the
bed
where
her
two
little
girls
lay
asleep
and
suddenly
it
had
come
upon
her
that
she
was
to
be
discovered
now
very
soon
not
by
strangers
but
by
her
own
children
growing
old
enough
to
observe
and
understand
moreover
that
her
degradation
would
become
theirs
and
then
it
came
the
horror
that
had
convinced
her
the
only
way
out
was
to
kill
them
and
afterward
herself
now
what
was
to
be
done
she
was
not
insane
she
was
just
a
sinner
who
felt
obliged
to
be
damned
god
had
at
least
a
dozen
ways
of
inspiring
william
and
not
all
of
them
orthodox
instead
of
harrowing
this
woman
with
a
prayer
he
took
on
a
competent
executive
air
you
are
to
do
nothing
he
told
her
and
be
sure
you
do
not
confess
your
sin
to
anyone
else
leave
everything
to
me
we
will
see
about
the
forgiveness
later
now
you
are
to
rest
and
not
think
till
i
get
the
way
clear
for
your
feet
he
went
out
told
the
attendants
that
martin
was
not
insane
but
had
suffered
a
shock
and
would
now
be
all
right
they
thought
he
had
achieved
a
miracle
when
they
had
returned
to
the
room
and
found
her
weeping
like
any
other
sane
woman
before
daylight
he
had
escorted
the
manager
of
the
quarry
to
the
nearest
railway
station
with
instructions
never
to
return
so
emphatically
given
that
he
never
did
he
prayed
earnestly
for
the
unfortunate
woman
himself
but
he
forbade
her
to
pray
for
herself
until
long
afterward
when
she
had
resumed
existence
upon
the
simple
basis
of
being
the
innocent
mother
of
her
innocent
children
if
she
begins
to
agonize
in
prayer
he
explained
to
me
she
will
go
mad
again
so
soon
as
she
recovers
from
the
insanity
of
evil
she
may
pray
but
not
now
chapter
xv
skeletons
in
william
doctrinal
closet
i
have
often
wondered
what
a
writer
of
fiction
would
have
made
out
of
such
a
story
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
woman
is
living
highly
respected
serenely
proud
of
her
two
grown
daughters
and
i
believe
william
simply
covered
up
her
sin
so
deep
with
his
wisdom
that
she
has
forgotten
it
his
methodist
doctrinal
closet
has
more
than
one
skeleton
like
this
in
it
repentance
is
not
remorse
he
used
to
argue
upon
rare
occasions
when
i
dragged
them
out
martin
could
not
make
the
proper
distinction
god
understood
i
have
no
doubt
his
conference
would
have
fired
him
for
fathering
very
curious
heresies
if
all
his
doings
with
sinners
had
been
published
there
was
the
apostate
for
example
whom
he
tried
to
save
at
the
expense
of
one
of
the
doctrines
of
his
church
just
as
baptists
believe
in
election
and
presbyterians
in
predestination
the
methodists
believe
in
apostasy
that
is
that
god
will
forsake
a
man
and
never
answer
his
prayers
if
the
man
waits
too
long
before
he
begins
to
pray
and
that
if
after
he
has
been
converted
he
leaves
the
way
of
righteousness
there
is
always
danger
that
god
will
abandon
him
in
his
sins
a
most
desperate
situation
is
that
of
the
methodist
apostate
because
there
is
so
much
elasticity
about
grace
in
our
church
and
it
is
so
easy
to
fall
from
it
that
a
modest
man
is
by
the
very
delicacy
and
humility
of
his
spirit
apt
to
fall
under
the
delusion
that
god
has
had
enough
patience
with
him
that
he
has
sinned
away
his
day
of
grace
i
recall
the
day
william
came
home
and
burned
seven
of
his
best
sermons
on
such
texts
as
this
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
it
was
after
he
had
read
the
burial
service
over
the
body
of
philip
hale
who
killed
himself
because
he
had
lost
god
and
could
not
find
him
hale
had
been
a
methodist
brought
up
in
that
faith
literally
by
parents
who
had
had
him
baptized
when
he
was
an
infant
and
who
had
kept
the
promise
made
then
to
bring
him
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
they
did
and
he
was
converted
at
an
early
age
before
the
tide
of
adolescence
set
in
it
seems
that
he
sinned
away
his
day
of
grace
during
this
dangerous
period
when
william
came
on
the
circuit
where
he
lived
he
was
a
sad
man
who
spent
much
of
his
spare
time
looking
for
god
and
praying
for
the
witness
of
his
spirit
his
was
the
most
tragic
figure
i
ever
saw
in
the
house
of
god
he
was
a
large
dark
man
with
a
blasted
look
on
his
somber
face
for
years
it
was
said
that
he
was
the
first
to
accept
the
invitation
to
sinners
to
the
altar
for
prayers
and
the
last
to
leave
it
always
with
that
lost
look
never
blessed
never
forgiven
william
stood
before
him
powerless
he
could
cast
no
light
in
that
darkness
it
was
literally
the
outer
darkness
where
light
can
not
be
created
toward
the
end
of
a
revival
during
which
he
had
wandered
back
and
forth
from
the
altar
night
after
night
like
a
dazed
sleepwalker
he
went
out
and
shot
himself
the
fate
of
this
man
was
one
of
the
tragedies
in
william
life
he
must
have
had
much
the
same
feeling
toward
him
that
a
surgeon
feels
toward
a
patient
who
dies
on
the
operating
table
if
he
had
survived
he
would
have
lived
i
never
heard
him
preach
after
that
about
the
dead
line
in
the
spiritual
life
one
thing
impressed
me
even
more
than
it
did
william
he
never
was
able
to
reach
the
chief
sinners
in
his
congregation
some
of
them
sat
in
such
high
places
in
the
church
perhaps
behind
him
in
the
pulpit
compared
with
these
the
reprobates
on
the
back
benches
were
easily
stirred
and
awakened
to
a
sense
of
their
lost
condition
sometimes
one
of
these
members
would
confess
to
feeling
cold
spiritually
but
i
do
not
now
recall
a
single
one
who
really
confessed
his
sins
or
renounced
them
suppose
a
steward
owns
a
big
flour
mill
and
can
afford
to
pay
the
preacher
liberally
bear
more
than
his
share
of
the
assessments
and
own
an
automobile
besides
because
he
cheats
every
customer
out
of
a
few
ounces
of
real
flour
by
substituting
fancy
flour
what
shall
he
do
sacrifice
the
auto
and
the
church
causes
he
never
does
because
at
bottom
he
has
a
sneaking
conviction
that
the
auto
in
particular
is
worth
more
than
his
kind
of
a
soul
and
he
is
shockingly
correct
in
his
estimate
of
values
if
there
really
are
any
apostates
in
this
world
they
belong
to
this
class
to
be
found
in
every
religious
denomination
but
if
he
did
not
close
in
often
with
the
chief
sinners
william
occasionally
came
upon
a
rare
saint
i
mean
rare
in
the
scientific
spiritual
sense
that
is
different
moving
in
time
but
not
of
it
the
unconscious
prophet
of
a
new
order
in
the
souls
of
mankind
and
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
him
measure
the
sword
of
his
spirit
with
one
of
these
the
last
encounter
he
had
of
this
kind
i
remember
was
on
the
bowtown
circuit
not
long
before
he
was
superannuated
and
it
was
with
a
woman
she
was
called
sal
prout
the
omission
of
the
last
syllable
of
her
given
name
implied
social
ostracism
and
personal
contempt
and
she
deserved
both
having
been
a
notorious
woman
in
her
younger
days
we
heard
of
her
first
from
brother
rheubottom
he
was
the
shriveled
grizzled
local
preacher
who
furnished
a
kind
of
gadfly
gospel
to
the
church
at
bowtown
when
he
was
invited
to
fill
the
pulpit
which
was
no
oftener
than
could
be
helped
he
called
to
tell
william
about
the
prout
woman
before
we
had
had
time
to
unpack
our
clothes
and
commentaries
she
been
a
terrible
creature
he
explained
wagging
his
hard
old
hickorynut
head
and
clawing
his
beard
with
a
kind
of
spiritual
rapacity
for
devouring
the
worst
of
sal
character
she
done
more
harm
than
a
dozen
wildcat
stills
then
all
at
once
here
about
five
years
ago
she
turned
good
she
heerd
from
god
it
was
blasphemous
seems
she
had
went
to
church
since
she
was
a
gal
i
do
say
she
ai
behavin
herself
and
all
that
but
orthodox
for
a
person
like
that
to
jest
set
down
before
her
do
in
the
grass
and
git
religion
without
ever
goin
nigh
a
church
and
public
confession
of
her
sins
not
that
everybody
do
know
what
she
has
been
if
them
kind
of
heresies
spread
where
will
the
church
be
what
the
use
of
havin
churches
we
want
you
to
go
down
there
and
to
her
brother
thompson
some
folks
in
this
community
have
been
worried
ever
since
she
done
it
we
ai
satisfied
with
her
experience
after
the
way
she
carried
on
talks
as
if
she
found
god
as
easy
as
if
she
been
an
innocent
child
when
some
of
us
that
have
lived
honorable
and
decent
all
our
lives
had
to
mourn
and
repent
and
take
on
like
a
house
afire
before
we
could
claim
the
blessin
i
look
into
sister
prout
condition
as
soon
as
possible
brother
rheubottom
said
william
folding
one
long
leg
over
the
other
and
fidgeting
in
his
chair
because
he
wanted
to
be
back
at
his
bookshelves
settling
the
relations
of
his
commentaries
for
the
coming
year
she
ai
even
a
sister
retorted
our
visitor
who
had
risen
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
door
she
never
the
church
when
somebody
named
it
to
her
as
a
duty
if
she
repented
of
her
sins
she
jest
laughed
and
said
she
would
not
bein
respectable
enough
to
belong
in
with
church
folks
she
she
stay
outside
with
the
wicked
where
she
belonged
and
not
embarrass
nobody
by
settin
by
in
church
she
reckoned
she
could
find
enough
to
do
out
there
instead
of
herself
up
with
respectable
women
in
the
foreign
missionary
society
that
the
way
she
talks
brother
thompson
and
there
ca
nobody
stop
her
bowtown
was
an
ugly
little
streaked
mountain
village
that
followed
the
windings
of
the
country
road
for
half
a
mile
and
then
gave
out
the
last
house
was
not
a
house
at
all
but
an
old
box
car
and
this
was
the
home
of
sal
prout
but
she
denied
that
it
was
a
box
car
with
a
hundred
fanciful
deceptions
first
it
was
whitewashed
within
and
without
second
it
was
covered
with
house
vines
third
the
dooryard
smiled
at
you
from
the
face
of
a
thousand
flowers
like
a
heavenly
catechism
of
color
but
go
as
often
as
we
would
we
never
found
sal
at
home
she
was
busy
with
the
wicked
she
could
do
anything
from
pulling
fodder
to
nursing
a
teething
baby
and
all
you
had
to
do
to
get
her
was
to
need
her
this
was
how
we
came
to
meet
her
at
last
william
health
was
failing
fast
now
and
he
got
down
with
sciatica
that
spring
he
had
been
in
bed
a
month
the
people
on
the
circuit
began
to
show
they
were
disappointed
in
not
having
an
active
man
who
could
fill
his
appointments
and
i
was
tired
and
discouraged
with
being
up
so
much
at
night
and
with
anxiety
for
fear
william
would
have
to
give
up
his
work
a
preacher
in
our
church
can
not
get
even
the
little
it
affords
from
the
superannuate
fund
until
he
has
been
on
the
superannuate
list
a
year
and
if
he
gives
up
his
work
in
the
middle
of
the
previous
year
that
means
he
must
go
say
eighteen
months
without
resources
that
is
a
long
time
when
you
have
not
been
able
to
save
anything
and
when
you
are
old
and
sick
so
i
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
door
of
the
parsonage
one
morning
after
william
had
had
a
particularly
bad
night
wondering
what
god
was
going
to
do
about
it
for
i
knew
we
could
not
expect
help
from
any
other
source
the
agnostics
may
say
what
they
please
but
if
you
get
cornered
between
old
age
and
starvation
you
will
find
out
that
there
is
a
real
good
god
who
numbers
the
remaining
hairs
of
your
head
and
counts
the
sparrows
fall
william
and
i
tried
him
and
we
know
there
were
terrible
times
toward
the
last
when
we
never
could
have
made
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
just
god
and
i
reckon
that
morning
was
one
of
the
times
for
as
i
was
sitting
there
wondering
sadly
what
would
happen
next
an
immense
woman
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
stood
before
me
on
the
doorstep
she
was
past
fifty
years
of
age
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
dismantled
woman
nothing
of
youth
or
loveliness
remained
i
have
never
seen
a
face
so
wrecked
with
wrinkles
so
marred
with
frightful
histories
yet
there
was
a
kind
of
fairness
over
all
her
ruins
i
am
sal
prout
she
said
and
it
was
so
deep
and
rich
a
voice
that
it
was
as
if
one
of
the
bare
brown
hills
of
the
earth
had
spoken
to
me
and
i
come
to
git
breakfast
she
added
spreading
peace
over
her
dreadful
face
with
an
ineffable
smile
an
hour
later
she
was
in
possession
of
william
and
me
and
the
parsonage
she
was
clearing
up
the
breakfast
things
when
she
said
you
looked
fagged
go
and
git
some
rest
i
take
care
of
him
nodding
her
head
toward
the
door
of
william
room
when
i
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
was
sitting
up
against
four
bottles
letting
her
call
him
brother
billy
that
sounds
scandalous
but
listening
from
where
i
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
front
room
i
could
tell
that
they
were
having
a
duel
of
spirits
and
that
she
was
taking
liberties
with
william
theology
that
must
have
made
his
guardian
angel
pale
he
wore
his
red
flannel
nightshirt
had
a
quilt
folded
around
his
legs
and
one
of
benson
commentaries
open
upon
his
knees
his
hair
was
bristling
in
fine
style
and
his
long
beard
lay
like
a
stole
upon
his
breast
his
hands
were
resting
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
he
was
regarding
sal
who
sat
in
the
opposite
corner
openly
dipping
snuff
with
a
kind
of
fascinated
disapproval
the
kind
of
faith
you
have
in
god
do
do
him
jestice
she
was
saying
it
sorter
infernal
it
so
mean
and
partial
your
god
ai
nothing
but
a
paradise
capitalist
and
aristocrat
the
sort
of
one
that
fixes
up
a
flower
garden
for
him
and
jest
his
saints
to
set
in
the
middle
of
and
sing
and
harp
on
their
harps
while
a
right
smart
chance
of
the
best
folks
sneak
and
shuffle
around
in
the
outer
darkness
forever
because
like
me
they
had
no
chance
to
be
good
and
so
went
wrong
before
they
knowed
where
they
were
going
sometimes
these
last
years
since
i
had
my
vision
of
him
i
wanted
to
tell
you
preachers
that
the
little
ornamental
divinity
that
you
shout
about
ai
nothing
but
a
figger
of
speech
took
from
the
heathens
and
made
over
by
heathen
christians
stop
said
william
lifting
one
of
his
thin
white
hands
and
waving
it
imperatively
at
her
you
must
not
speak
irreverently
i
know
you
do
mean
it
but
jest
answer
me
this
sir
is
your
leg
hurtin
any
worse
no
replied
william
mollified
not
a
mite
she
insisted
no
i
am
much
easier
of
the
pain
well
then
i
goin
to
say
this
much
more
even
if
it
strangles
you
the
word
god
stands
for
something
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
a
paradise
gardener
with
a
taste
for
music
you
do
put
it
fair
sister
prout
said
william
aggrieved
i
ca
put
it
in
as
fine
language
as
saint
john
if
that
what
you
mean
what
is
the
nature
of
god
as
you
see
him
we
are
made
very
queer
by
the
soul
not
nearly
so
much
alike
as
we
are
in
other
respects
i
saw
now
the
same
light
pass
over
sal
face
that
i
had
often
seen
in
william
yet
they
could
not
agree
about
their
one
heavenly
father
the
god
i
trust
is
the
one
that
makes
flowers
like
them
bloom
for
sech
as
me
she
began
pointing
through
the
window
at
a
rose
that
lets
his
rain
fall
in
my
garden
same
as
he
does
in
that
never
takes
his
spite
out
on
me
for
bein
what
i
was
but
jest
made
it
hard
for
me
and
waited
patient
for
me
he
the
kind
of
god
sir
that
can
change
a
heart
like
mine
from
all
the
evil
there
is
and
make
it
so
i
can
think
good
thoughts
and
be
kind
and
enjoy
his
hills
and
hear
the
birds
sing
again
same
as
i
used
to
pay
attention
to
when
i
was
a
little
gal
she
lowered
her
voice
as
if
speaking
of
a
mortal
sorrow
there
were
years
and
years
sir
when
them
little
creatures
were
singin
all
around
me
every
day
but
i
could
hear
my
deeds
were
so
evil
i
do
reckon
you
know
it
livin
the
little
you
have
but
sin
affects
you
that
way
takes
away
your
hearin
for
sweet
sounds
your
sight
for
what
is
lovely
but
god
he
jest
kept
on
lettin
his
birds
sing
for
me
and
the
sun
riz
jest
as
fine
above
the
hills
behind
my
house
he
did
pick
at
me
nor
put
a
sign
on
me
same
as
folks
did
of
my
shame
as
he
could
have
done
with
a
cloud
or
something
over
my
house
you
see
he
fixed
things
from
the
foundations
of
the
world
so
as
work
out
good
and
not
evil
for
us
every
one
he
knowed
we
all
git
tired
and
come
home
some
time
the
same
as
i
come
i
do
know
whether
you
ever
found
it
out
or
not
sir
but
sinners
git
awful
tired
of
sinnin
god
knows
that
he
knows
they
just
ca
keep
it
up
forever
the
next
winter
sal
prout
died
of
smallpox
after
nursing
a
community
of
sawmill
hands
farther
up
in
the
mountains
who
had
been
stricken
with
the
disease
and
many
of
whom
must
have
died
but
for
her
care
william
never
recovered
from
that
attack
of
rheumatism
his
legs
got
well
but
he
did
not
he
was
different
afterward
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
a
trance
he
seemed
always
to
look
and
speak
across
a
space
of
which
he
was
not
conscious
he
filled
his
appointments
after
a
fashion
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
at
the
bowtown
district
but
he
grew
increasingly
forgetful
of
people
and
all
earthly
considerations
sometimes
he
fell
to
dreaming
in
the
middle
of
his
sermon
looking
over
the
heads
of
his
congregation
as
if
he
was
expecting
noah
dove
to
bring
him
a
token
or
michael
to
blow
his
trumpet
then
again
he
would
make
his
prayer
longer
than
his
sermon
the
people
did
not
like
it
and
the
presiding
elder
called
for
his
superannuation
at
the
conference
that
fall
on
the
grounds
that
brother
thompson
showed
signs
of
failing
powers
maybe
he
did
but
it
was
only
his
mortal
faculties
that
were
failing
to
the
last
he
retained
a
clear
and
definite
knowledge
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
many
a
man
in
possession
of
all
his
powers
never
attains
the
great
change
was
that
he
took
on
a
melancholy
attitude
to
reality
chapter
xvi
in
the
little
graveyard
behind
redwine
church
william
was
too
dazed
by
the
misfortune
of
his
superannuation
to
think
or
plan
for
the
future
for
him
there
was
no
future
he
sat
in
the
chimney
corner
following
me
about
the
house
with
his
vacant
eyes
but
really
grieving
for
one
of
the
choice
hard
circuits
with
its
salary
such
as
he
had
received
for
years
or
remembering
the
good
pastoral
times
he
had
upon
one
in
this
or
that
year
i
have
sometimes
wondered
what
would
be
the
moral
effect
upon
a
church
community
if
an
old
and
helpless
preacher
like
william
should
be
sent
to
it
with
the
understanding
that
the
church
should
minister
to
him
instead
of
his
ministering
to
the
church
that
every
saint
and
sinner
should
be
invited
to
contribute
to
his
peace
and
comfort
even
as
for
years
he
had
labored
for
them
there
would
be
less
preaching
of
course
but
more
development
in
real
christian
service
an
old
preacher
treated
in
this
manner
would
become
very
dictatorial
a
perfect
autocrat
about
ordering
charities
for
the
poor
and
prayers
for
the
penitents
but
would
it
be
so
bad
for
the
church
however
that
was
not
my
consideration
now
the
redwine
circuit
was
only
twenty
miles
distant
the
little
house
between
the
two
green
hills
that
had
been
the
methodist
parsonage
thirty
years
before
was
long
since
abandoned
for
a
shiny
green
and
yellow
new
parsonage
at
royden
and
while
william
who
had
always
had
his
home
dictated
to
him
by
the
conference
showed
a
pathetic
apathy
about
choosing
one
for
himself
i
hankered
for
the
cottage
with
its
ugly
old
chimneys
that
had
first
sheltered
our
life
together
so
within
a
month
the
horse
and
buggy
were
sold
the
cottage
at
redwine
rented
and
we
settled
in
it
like
two
crippled
birds
in
a
nest
now
for
the
first
time
since
i
left
edenton
a
happy
thoughtless
bride
i
had
leisure
to
think
just
of
ourselves
of
our
sum
total
as
it
were
and
i
found
that
we
were
two
human
numerals
added
together
for
a
lifetime
which
made
a
deficit
yet
we
had
not
been
idle
or
indifferent
workers
for
thirty
years
william
had
been
in
the
itinerancy
filling
nearly
every
third
and
fourth
class
appointment
in
his
conference
he
had
preached
over
three
thousand
sermons
baptized
more
than
four
hundred
infants
received
nearly
four
thousand
souls
into
membership
he
had
been
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
raise
his
assessments
and
had
paid
more
pastoral
calls
than
half
a
dozen
doctors
need
to
make
in
order
to
become
famous
and
wealthy
time
changed
us
we
grew
old
i
abandoned
my
to
will
and
my
face
settled
into
the
expression
of
a
good
negative
that
has
been
blurred
by
too
long
exposure
to
a
strong
light
toward
the
end
william
looked
like
the
remnant
of
a
saint
his
face
was
sunken
and
hollowed
out
till
the
very
wesley
in
him
showed
through
his
beard
was
long
and
had
whitened
until
it
gave
his
moses
head
the
appearance
of
coming
up
out
of
a
holy
mist
so
i
say
we
aged
but
we
went
on
from
circuit
to
circuit
with
no
other
change
except
that
when
we
saved
enough
money
william
bought
a
new
horse
it
is
a
terrible
treadmill
and
we
could
expect
no
reward
or
change
in
this
world
no
promotion
no
ease
of
mind
except
the
ease
of
prayers
which
i
never
enjoyed
as
much
as
william
did
i
had
feelings
that
prayers
did
not
put
down
the
desires
that
they
did
not
satisfy
there
were
times
when
i
almost
hated
prayers
when
i
had
a
mortal
aversion
to
heaven
and
wished
only
that
god
would
give
me
a
long
of
the
spirit
we
found
the
same
kind
of
sinners
everywhere
and
the
same
defects
in
all
the
saints
sometimes
i
even
wished
some
one
would
develop
a
new
sort
of
wickedness
a
kind
that
would
vary
the
dreadful
monotony
of
repentance
and
cause
william
to
scratch
his
theological
head
for
a
different
kind
of
sermon
but
no
one
ever
did
whether
we
were
in
the
mountains
or
in
the
towns
among
the
rich
or
the
poor
the
people
transgressed
by
the
same
mortal
rule
of
three
and
fell
short
of
the
glory
of
god
exactly
alike
at
last
i
came
to
understand
that
there
is
just
one
kind
of
sin
in
the
world
the
sin
against
love
and
no
saints
at
all
i
ca
say
that
i
was
disappointed
but
i
was
just
tired
of
the
awful
upward
strain
of
trying
to
develop
faculties
and
feelings
suitable
to
another
world
in
this
one
and
to
make
things
worse
william
took
on
a
weary
look
after
his
superannuation
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
made
a
long
journey
in
vain
this
is
always
the
last
definition
the
itinerancy
writes
upon
the
faces
of
its
superannuates
they
are
unhappy
mortified
like
honorable
men
who
have
failed
in
a
business
they
no
longer
pretend
to
have
better
health
than
they
really
have
which
is
the
pathetic
hypocrisy
they
all
practice
toward
the
last
when
they
are
in
annual
fear
of
superannuation
so
i
looked
at
our
deficit
and
knew
that
something
was
wrong
still
i
went
about
the
little
old
house
and
garden
trying
to
reconstruct
the
memory
of
happiness
and
planning
to
spend
our
last
days
unharassed
by
salvation
anxieties
i
have
never
doubted
the
goodness
of
god
but
things
being
as
they
are
and
we
being
what
we
are
it
takes
a
long
time
for
him
to
work
it
out
for
us
especially
in
any
kind
of
a
church
meanwhile
i
tried
to
find
some
of
our
old
friends
only
to
discover
that
most
of
them
were
dead
i
planted
a
few
annuals
set
some
hens
and
prepared
to
cultivate
my
own
peace
but
william
was
changed
he
had
lost
his
courage
whenever
the
rheumatism
struck
him
he
gave
in
to
it
with
a
groan
then
he
took
up
with
job
in
the
scriptures
and
before
we
had
been
back
long
enough
for
the
flowers
to
bloom
he
just
turned
over
on
his
spiritual
ashheap
and
died
illustration
then
he
took
up
with
job
in
the
scriptures
he
is
buried
in
the
little
graveyard
behind
redwine
church
along
with
most
of
the
men
and
women
to
whom
he
preached
in
it
thirty
years
ago
i
can
feel
that
i
am
not
setting
things
down
right
not
making
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
experience
clearly
so
that
you
may
see
as
i
can
when
i
close
my
eyes
the
staggering
tombstones
in
the
brown
shadows
behind
the
little
brown
church
but
when
one
has
been
in
the
methodist
itinerancy
a
lifetime
one
can
not
do
that
i
used
to
wonder
why
paul
passing
through
all
the
grandest
cities
and
civilizations
of
his
times
never
left
behind
him
a
single
description
of
any
of
their
glories
only
a
reference
to
the
altar
to
an
unknown
god
that
he
found
in
athens
but
now
i
know
paul
lost
the
memory
of
sight
he
had
eyes
to
the
things
of
the
world
so
it
is
with
the
itinerant
the
earth
becomes
one
of
the
stars
i
can
not
remember
roads
and
realities
i
recall
most
clearly
only
spiritual
facts
like
this
timothy
brown
was
a
bad
man
soundly
converted
under
william
ministry
but
how
he
looked
on
which
circuit
he
lived
i
have
forgotten
long
ago
in
spite
of
a
really
worldly
mind
william
prayed
away
its
foundations
during
those
thirty
years
until
now
the
very
scene
of
his
passing
floats
a
mist
in
memory
i
know
he
lay
in
the
same
house
where
he
had
brought
me
on
our
wedding
day
through
the
window
in
the
pearl
light
of
the
early
morning
there
was
the
same
freshness
upon
the
hills
the
same
streams
glistening
like
silver
maces
between
there
was
the
same
little
valley
below
fluted
in
like
a
cup
filled
with
corn
and
honey
and
bees
and
flowers
the
same
gray
farmhouses
brooded
close
to
the
earth
with
children
playing
in
the
dooryards
it
was
all
there
the
morning
he
died
as
it
had
been
that
blue
and
glad
morning
thirty
years
before
but
i
could
not
see
it
or
feel
it
with
him
lying
stretched
and
still
upon
the
bed
with
the
sheet
drawn
over
his
face
and
the
people
crowding
in
whispering
shuffling
bearing
the
long
black
coffin
among
them
i
say
it
is
dim
and
blurred
and
i
can
not
think
it
or
write
it
properly
there
seemed
a
rime
upon
the
the
hills
were
bare
and
the
cup
of
the
valley
lay
drained
and
empty
before
me
with
the
shadow
of
death
darkening
all
the
light
of
the
day
a
very
old
woman
bent
shriveled
down
to
her
hull
and
bones
with
her
thin
lips
sucked
in
between
her
gums
came
and
tugged
at
my
sleeve
i
recognized
sister
glory
white
wearing
the
same
look
of
rapacious
cheerfulness
upon
her
bones
that
she
used
to
wear
upon
her
fat
face
when
she
had
a
body
to
prepare
for
burial
come
sister
thompson
you
must
git
up
and
go
out
we
air
ready
to
lay
him
out
now
oh
not
him
i
cried
you
have
laid
out
so
many
let
some
one
else
do
it
for
i
could
not
forget
the
frightful
pleasure
she
had
taken
years
ago
in
her
ghoulish
office
and
why
not
him
i
helped
to
put
away
every
man
woman
and
child
that
has
died
in
this
settlement
since
i
was
grown
and
i
ai
to
shirk
my
duty
to
brother
thompson
not
that
i
ever
expected
to
do
it
for
him
she
babbled
on
gently
urging
me
from
the
room
where
her
presence
was
the
last
blinding
touch
of
horror
for
me
so
far
my
autobiography
has
been
mixed
with
william
biography
just
as
my
life
seems
to
mingle
with
the
dust
in
his
grave
but
i
came
to
an
experience
now
of
my
own
unglorified
by
william
so
strange
that
i
can
not
explain
it
unless
there
is
what
may
be
called
a
reversion
to
type
in
spirit
like
this
that
a
person
may
be
absolutely
dominated
for
years
by
certain
influences
and
not
only
feel
no
antagonism
to
them
but
actually
yield
with
devotion
and
inconceivable
sacrifices
yet
when
the
influence
is
removed
and
there
is
no
longer
the
for
faithfulness
the
illusion
not
only
passes
but
the
person
finds
himself
of
his
original
mind
and
spirit
emancipated
gone
back
to
himself
what
he
really
was
in
the
beginning
before
the
domination
began
such
at
least
is
as
near
what
happened
in
my
own
case
as
i
can
tell
it
i
remained
in
the
little
house
between
the
hills
walking
about
attending
to
my
few
wants
receiving
an
occasional
visitor
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
sorrow
william
had
always
meant
more
to
me
than
heaven
i
had
endured
poverty
prayers
persecutions
and
revivals
for
his
sake
and
now
i
had
lost
him
the
very
thought
was
immeasurable
i
wore
it
for
mourning
i
missed
him
when
i
looked
down
the
bridle
path
into
the
valley
and
i
missed
him
when
i
looked
at
the
stars
nothing
meant
anything
to
me
without
him
then
suddenly
the
veil
lifted
i
seemed
at
last
to
have
conceded
him
to
what
is
beyond
the
grave
at
once
my
own
mind
came
back
to
me
not
the
humble
mind
i
had
during
his
life
but
my
very
own
and
it
was
like
another
conversion
i
remembered
scenes
and
thoughts
and
faces
that
i
had
not
recalled
since
girlhood
the
innocent
gayety
of
my
youth
came
back
to
me
and
i
recalled
distinctly
with
what
naïve
happy
worldliness
i
faced
the
world
then
and
not
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
i
have
been
staring
at
since
through
william
eyes
for
thirty
years
the
next
sunday
i
went
to
church
as
usual
but
i
did
not
go
up
near
the
front
which
had
always
been
my
custom
it
occurred
to
me
that
now
i
did
not
have
to
sit
in
the
saint
neighborhood
but
might
sit
back
with
the
honester
human
beings
the
preacher
was
a
young
man
of
the
progressive
new
order
who
sustained
the
same
relation
as
pastor
to
the
church
that
an
ambitious
foreman
sustains
to
a
business
that
must
be
renovated
and
improved
he
was
taking
up
his
foreign
missionary
collection
very
much
after
the
manner
of
an
auctioneer
five
dollars
five
dollars
five
dollars
who
gives
five
dollars
that
the
gospel
may
be
spread
in
china
and
siam
who
gives
five
dollars
that
there
may
be
light
in
india
and
to
save
women
from
casting
their
innocent
babes
into
the
ganges
thank
you
sister
tuttle
the
women
are
leading
off
getting
ahead
of
you
brethren
put
down
five
dollars
from
sister
tuttle
now
who
will
give
four
dollars
and
so
on
down
till
even
the
sinners
on
the
back
benches
subscribed
a
rattle
of
dimes
i
listened
with
comfortable
indifference
i
thought
of
how
william
died
without
enough
oil
in
him
to
grease
his
joints
and
how
many
more
like
him
had
died
too
weak
and
depleted
to
have
even
assurance
of
their
own
salvation
i
remembered
how
i
wished
toward
the
last
that
i
could
afford
a
few
delicacies
for
william
liked
cordials
and
real
cream
which
might
have
strengthened
and
cheered
him
then
and
there
i
resolved
never
to
give
another
cent
to
foreign
missions
i
am
not
opposed
to
foreign
missions
you
understand
william
and
i
did
without
much
that
the
heathen
might
have
missionaries
and
the
gospel
preached
to
them
but
that
is
just
it
we
did
without
too
much
i
am
not
saying
that
anyone
else
ought
to
lessen
their
contribution
to
this
cause
let
them
give
even
more
but
i
am
certain
they
ought
to
treble
their
contribution
to
old
preachers
there
is
something
fearful
in
the
bible
like
this
but
if
any
provide
not
for
his
own
and
especially
for
those
of
his
own
house
he
hath
denied
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel
that
scripture
expressed
my
feelings
exactly
as
i
listened
to
the
preacher
take
up
his
foreign
missionary
collection
and
remembered
william
dreadful
poverty
so
i
say
i
made
up
my
own
private
mind
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
way
church
collections
are
distributed
and
that
if
i
ever
had
any
spare
money
it
should
be
devoted
to
purchasing
a
taller
tombstone
for
william
immediately
i
felt
my
own
i
am
sitting
up
in
me
and
taking
courage
it
was
a
grand
sensation
for
so
many
years
i
had
not
belonged
to
myself
i
was
simply
a
numeral
william
personal
dynamo
at
the
women
societies
suddenly
it
came
to
me
that
i
was
a
free
moral
agent
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
widows
are
the
only
women
who
are
the
scandalous
reflection
took
hold
of
me
as
i
listened
to
the
collection
and
reflected
that
never
again
would
i
have
to
worry
lest
william
fail
to
raise
all
his
assessments
that
i
should
never
be
anxious
now
for
fear
his
sermons
might
not
please
the
prominent
members
of
his
church
but
the
most
refreshing
rejuvenating
of
all
was
the
thought
that
at
last
i
could
be
a
little
less
good
i
looked
at
the
men
and
women
sitting
in
still
rows
across
the
little
church
with
their
faces
lit
like
candles
from
the
face
and
i
experienced
a
peaceful
remoteness
from
them
and
from
the
pulpit
light
chapter
xvii
back
again
to
the
world
the
carnal
man
never
dies
in
us
nor
the
carnal
woman
either
for
that
matter
we
only
say
so
in
our
prayers
and
rituals
because
we
do
not
know
yet
how
to
be
spiritually
truthful
about
our
own
flesh
and
blood
but
god
who
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
when
he
made
us
carnal
sees
to
it
that
in
spite
of
our
egregious
pretensions
we
remain
honest
adams
and
adamesses
to
the
end
so
for
years
without
acknowledging
it
to
myself
i
had
been
homesick
for
the
world
and
the
things
of
the
world
i
did
not
want
to
sin
i
simply
longed
to
be
natural
to
live
a
trifle
less
perpendicularly
in
my
soul
there
had
been
so
many
nights
when
i
would
rather
have
been
at
the
grand
opera
not
that
william
talks
were
not
the
very
bread
of
life
they
were
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
losing
one
appetite
for
just
one
kind
of
bread
i
have
always
thought
one
of
the
notable
things
about
the
israelites
journey
through
the
wilderness
was
the
amazing
fortitude
with
which
they
accepted
their
manna
diet
anyhow
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
words
to
tell
how
i
pined
for
the
real
laughter
and
lightness
and
play
of
life
william
had
needed
them
no
less
but
the
difference
was
he
never
knew
it
when
he
felt
he
thought
it
was
a
sign
of
spiritual
anaemia
and
prayed
for
a
closer
walk
with
god
as
if
god
was
not
also
the
god
of
the
world
even
more
than
he
is
the
caste
deity
of
any
church
or
creed
i
am
not
reflecting
on
william
in
saying
this
i
sooner
reflect
upon
one
of
the
crown
jewels
of
heaven
but
i
am
reflecting
upon
his
understanding
it
was
not
sufficiently
earthly
no
good
priest
is
still
i
had
been
his
faithful
wife
for
thirty
years
and
a
consistent
member
of
a
church
which
forbids
nearly
every
form
of
amusement
that
can
not
be
taken
at
a
picnic
a
church
festival
or
at
an
epworth
league
convention
i
did
not
wait
to
speak
to
the
people
after
the
sermon
the
way
a
preacher
wife
must
do
to
show
her
friendliness
and
interest
i
hurried
out
and
around
behind
the
church
to
where
he
lay
folded
deep
beneath
the
pine
shadows
and
there
i
had
it
out
with
him
as
sometimes
we
had
it
out
together
in
other
days
i
doing
all
the
talking
and
he
no
less
silent
than
usual
there
in
his
holy
grave
we
had
never
quarreled
as
man
and
wife
because
he
would
not
do
his
part
of
the
contending
i
untied
my
bonnet
strings
took
it
off
and
laid
it
on
the
grass
sat
down
by
his
headstone
and
cried
not
so
much
for
him
as
for
fear
he
would
not
understand
he
never
had
illustration
not
so
much
for
him
as
for
fear
he
would
not
understand
william
greatest
limitation
as
a
minister
was
his
firm
conviction
that
the
world
was
a
drawback
to
heaven
he
fought
it
and
abused
it
to
the
last
as
if
god
had
not
made
it
and
designed
it
to
furnish
material
for
his
higher
kingdom
and
somehow
as
i
wept
and
talked
down
to
him
in
his
dust
i
felt
wonderfully
like
the
young
woman
that
had
loved
him
and
feared
him
during
those
first
rebellious
years
when
i
was
still
so
much
the
episcopalian
and
so
little
the
methodist
the
next
day
i
sent
a
letter
to
my
sister
sarah
a
widow
living
with
her
two
grown
daughters
in
new
york
for
years
i
had
kept
up
no
relations
with
my
own
family
they
were
of
the
world
prosperous
and
i
felt
that
they
could
not
understand
william
nor
the
way
we
lived
but
now
i
was
writing
to
accept
the
invitation
sarah
sent
me
just
after
william
death
to
make
my
home
with
her
a
week
later
i
packed
my
things
borrowed
my
church
letter
locked
my
door
and
took
the
train
at
royden
for
new
york
i
told
the
neighbors
i
was
going
for
a
visit
to
new
york
but
really
i
was
on
my
way
to
find
the
world
again
and
i
found
it
you
can
not
find
anything
else
in
new
york
sarah
and
the
girls
met
me
at
the
grand
central
station
and
they
spent
more
kisses
welcoming
me
than
i
had
received
since
my
bridal
days
sarah
is
two
years
older
than
i
am
but
she
looks
ten
years
younger
and
there
is
not
the
mark
of
a
prayer
on
her
smooth
face
while
i
feel
as
if
i
might
have
the
doxology
stamped
in
wrinkles
above
my
eyebrows
everything
is
different
from
the
way
it
is
at
home
we
do
not
have
dinner
till
and
there
is
no
mantel
or
fireplace
in
my
room
although
the
furniture
is
grander
than
anything
i
ever
saw
i
set
william
photograph
on
the
dresser
and
i
can
tell
by
the
way
he
looks
at
me
all
day
long
that
he
would
not
approve
of
the
way
i
am
carrying
on
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
must
have
a
little
spell
of
world
life
that
other
in
which
i
qualified
with
him
for
heaven
was
too
stretching
to
something
in
me
that
grew
mortally
tired
of
stretching
i
have
set
myself
with
all
diligence
to
enjoy
the
things
of
this
world
in
the
time
that
left
me
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
nearly
certain
i
am
that
they
were
meant
for
us
one
thing
alone
troubles
me
that
is
the
thought
of
william
going
up
and
down
these
thirty
years
just
preaching
and
praying
and
bearing
other
people
burdens
and
never
once
having
the
right
to
step
aside
and
rest
his
soul
from
being
just
good
never
once
having
a
natural
human
vacation
in
the
natural
human
world
always
praying
and
preaching
and
fasting
that
he
might
pray
and
preach
better
always
scrimping
that
he
might
be
able
to
pay
more
to
the
cause
of
missions
always
a
little
threadbare
and
often
a
little
breathless
spiritually
but
always
persistently
stalking
peter
and
paul
and
the
angels
through
the
scriptures
up
the
high
and
higher
altitudes
of
his
own
beautiful
imagination
no
matter
how
rested
he
is
now
in
heaven
no
matter
how
much
he
may
be
enjoying
himself
my
heart
aches
for
him
because
of
the
innocent
happiness
he
missed
here
sometimes
when
i
am
with
sarah
girls
at
a
play
like
john
the
baptist
as
the
curtain
rises
and
falls
upon
the
great
scenes
i
sit
and
think
of
him
and
what
it
would
have
meant
to
him
if
in
all
those
years
of
his
ministry
he
could
have
had
such
a
vision
of
his
dear
bible
people
at
home
in
judaea
it
foolish
of
course
but
i
still
long
to
do
something
for
him
something
to
make
up
for
the
weariness
and
blindness
through
which
he
passed
with
such
simple
dignity
up
to
god
who
never
meant
for
him
to
make
such
a
hard
journey
of
it
no
one
knew
it
probably
save
a
few
of
the
angels
but
he
was
a
great
man
since
i
have
been
here
where
everybody
and
every
thought
of
everybody
is
so
different
from
him
and
his
thinking
i
can
see
him
plainer
understand
him
better
than
i
did
living
side
by
side
with
him
this
is
why
i
have
been
spending
my
time
between
tea
parties
and
lectures
on
art
and
evolution
and
receptions
and
theaters
writing
these
letters
as
a
memorial
of
him
i
used
to
wish
i
could
have
a
portrait
of
him
painted
by
a
great
artist
as
he
looked
sometimes
on
a
sabbath
day
when
he
had
a
baby
to
baptize
or
when
he
be
bending
above
an
altar
full
of
penitents
there
was
a
grandeur
in
william
faith
that
gave
him
an
awful
near
likeness
to
immortality
even
in
his
flesh
at
such
times
but
of
course
we
could
never
think
of
the
portrait
so
in
these
letters
i
have
tried
to
draw
a
likeness
of
him
every
line
and
shadow
of
it
is
as
true
as
i
can
make
it
to
what
he
really
was
i
reckon
plenty
of
people
back
there
on
his
circuits
will
recognize
it
although
i
have
changed
names
so
as
not
to
be
too
personal
they
will
remember
him
although
he
was
not
what
is
known
as
an
preacher
i
have
often
thought
about
it
since
i
have
been
up
here
what
william
did
know
or
dream
of
i
never
heard
him
mention
evolution
his
doubts
were
not
intellectual
and
his
troubles
were
just
spiritual
he
never
suspected
that
there
were
two
isaiahs
never
discovered
that
david
did
not
write
his
own
psalms
or
that
genesis
was
considered
a
fable
never
noticed
anything
queer
about
the
way
moses
kept
on
writing
about
himself
after
he
was
dead
and
his
death
certificate
properly
recorded
by
himself
in
the
scriptures
he
was
a
man
of
faith
all
of
his
ideas
came
out
of
that
one
little
mustard
seed
i
doubt
if
have
been
surprised
if
some
day
he
had
come
upon
a
burning
bush
along
one
of
the
bridle
paths
of
his
circuit
as
for
me
i
do
not
care
what
they
say
here
in
new
york
or
even
in
the
pentateuch
i
have
a
sight
more
confidence
in
that
scripture
of
the
burning
bush
if
william
had
recorded
it
instead
of
moses
i
never
set
much
store
by
moses
as
a
truth
teller
he
may
have
been
a
good
hand
at
chiseling
out
the
ten
commandments
in
the
tables
of
stone
and
he
may
have
been
strong
enough
to
tote
them
down
by
himself
from
sinai
but
moses
was
too
much
of
a
hero
to
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
about
himself
i
never
knew
a
hero
who
could
do
it
their
courage
gets
mixed
with
their
imagination
then
again
you
can
see
that
i
could
not
write
about
a
man
like
william
in
the
modern
literary
style
as
if
he
was
a
new
brand
of
spiritual
soap
or
the
hero
of
a
fashionable
congregation
the
people
he
served
were
not
like
those
in
new
york
who
appear
to
have
been
created
by
electricity
with
a
spiritual
button
for
a
soul
that
you
press
into
a
religious
fervor
by
rendering
an
organ
opera
behind
the
pulpit
or
maybe
the
preacher
does
it
with
a
motor
notion
that
demonstrates
a
scientific
relation
between
some
other
life
and
this
one
the
people
william
served
were
backwoods
and
mountain
folk
for
the
most
part
who
grew
out
of
the
soil
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
the
red
oaks
and
the
hills
they
were
not
happy
nor
good
but
they
were
scriptural
the
men
were
in
solemn
bondage
to
heaven
religion
was
a
sort
of
life
sentence
they
worked
out
with
awful
diligence
and
the
women
seemed
born
again
just
to
fade
and
pray
not
as
these
women
of
the
world
fade
utterly
but
like
fair
plucked
for
an
altar
that
wither
soon
in
heaven
you
will
not
find
them
herded
in
the
hosannah
chorus
with
the
great
good
women
of
history
like
jane
addams
and
frances
willard
but
they
will
be
there
in
some
dim
cove
of
the
celestial
hills
sweetly
still
spinning
love
upon
the
distaffs
of
heaven
weaving
yarn
feathers
for
the
younger
angels
i
say
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
such
a
preacher
and
such
people
as
if
they
were
characters
in
an
electric
religious
fancy
walking
to
and
from
church
here
in
this
city
i
have
almost
wondered
if
they
were
ever
real
thinking
of
them
sets
me
to
recalling
stanzas
from
hymns
i
smell
the
thyme
upon
their
hills
it
seems
as
if
my
adjectives
were
beginning
to
grow
like
flowers
upon
william
grave
i
can
see
the
candles
lit
for
evening
services
in
heaven
and
him
sitting
in
the
amen
corner
away
from
the
fashionable
saints
comparing
notes
with
moses
and
elijah
in
his
deep
organ
undertones
the
trouble
with
william
was
that
he
was
the
hero
of
another
world
in
this
one
handcuffed
by
a
church
discipline
and
the
trouble
with
the
average
new
york
preacher
is
that
he
is
barely
a
foreigner
in
this
world
who
is
apologizing
continually
to
his
congregation
for
believing
in
his
own
other
country
but
now
i
have
finished
this
poor
drawing
of
william
character
if
i
could
have
made
it
enough
like
him
it
might
have
been
fit
for
one
of
the
family
portraits
of
the
saints
in
heaven
and
i
have
often
wondered
why
the
monument
builders
have
never
thought
to
raise
a
statue
to
the
methodist
circuit
rider
the
and
the
other
daughters
of
this
and
that
raise
monuments
to
men
who
were
only
brave
but
no
one
has
thought
yet
to
erect
a
statue
to
the
memory
of
the
methodist
circuit
riders
who
are
not
less
brave
but
who
have
doubtless
broken
some
heaven
records
in
simple
goodness
and
chapter
xviii
conscientious
scruples
about
the
church
i
had
thought
that
these
letters
were
finished
but
i
am
adding
this
postscript
to
say
that
i
leave
new
york
for
the
little
house
between
the
hills
on
the
redwine
circuit
this
resolution
is
not
in
keeping
with
some
views
and
sentiments
i
have
written
in
these
pages
but
being
a
woman
i
thank
god
i
can
be
as
inconsistent
as
is
necessary
to
feminine
peace
of
mind
i
reckon
i
never
be
satisfied
now
in
the
world
or
in
the
church
without
william
i
ca
seem
to
settle
into
any
state
of
being
of
my
own
i
am
not
saying
that
i
have
not
had
a
good
time
here
but
after
all
i
do
not
belong
with
the
people
of
the
world
either
since
i
have
been
with
sarah
i
have
had
constantly
to
resist
the
temptation
to
speak
to
her
about
her
soul
just
from
force
of
habit
i
have
never
seen
in
all
my
years
with
william
a
woman
of
her
age
so
youthfully
cheerfully
unconscious
of
having
a
soul
and
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
i
can
feel
the
moral
elbows
of
mine
sticking
out
in
every
conversation
as
if
heaven
had
made
all
my
thoughts
angular
it
is
a
sort
of
horned
integrity
that
grows
up
in
a
woman
who
follows
the
gospel
flag
of
the
methodist
itinerancy
i
am
sure
it
is
often
embarrassing
to
sarah
and
the
girls
especially
when
they
have
company
not
the
kind
of
company
william
and
i
had
missionaries
and
bible
pedlers
and
tramps
and
beggars
and
occasionally
toward
the
last
a
little
deaconess
but
lilith
ladies
and
one
or
two
that
william
would
call
delilahs
and
handsome
sleek
intellectual
men
who
appeared
to
be
as
ignorant
of
god
as
i
am
of
natural
history
i
am
not
saying
that
they
are
not
decent
people
but
they
are
not
all
there
i
miss
something
out
of
them
if
they
have
ever
had
souls
they
have
had
them
removed
probably
by
a
kind
of
reasoning
surgery
quite
as
effective
as
the
literal
surgery
with
which
so
many
of
them
have
their
poor
appendixes
removed
i
have
told
sarah
and
while
she
expresses
regret
i
am
sure
she
feels
relieved
it
is
straining
to
have
a
person
in
the
family
who
belongs
to
a
different
spiritual
species
and
now
i
have
just
finished
packing
my
things
i
am
thankful
i
told
the
neighbors
that
i
was
going
on
a
visit
i
came
suddenly
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
only
a
visit
because
of
a
thing
that
happened
i
have
not
been
offended
morally
by
anything
i
have
seen
in
the
theaters
or
other
places
of
amusement
but
i
have
had
conscientious
scruples
about
the
churches
here
this
would
be
the
sabbath
day
far
away
in
the
country
where
the
hills
are
at
prayer
and
the
pine
trees
swing
their
shadows
over
the
graves
in
redwine
churchyard
but
here
in
new
york
it
is
merely
the
day
when
you
change
your
occupations
and
amusements
still
there
is
preaching
for
those
who
are
not
drunk
or
asleep
or
in
the
parks
or
at
coney
island
or
giving
parties
at
their
country
places
or
planning
the
millennium
without
god
along
socialistic
scantlings
of
thought
and
theories
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
i
went
with
the
girls
to
a
fashionable
church
and
this
is
how
the
morals
in
me
that
william
planted
came
to
take
offense
and
how
i
reached
the
conclusion
that
i
had
best
go
back
home
where
life
is
indeed
made
too
hard
for
the
spirit
but
where
at
least
one
may
be
decently
conscious
of
having
one
according
to
the
scriptures
the
church
we
attended
was
nearly
as
inside
as
a
theater
every
pew
was
filled
and
there
was
no
misbehavior
on
the
back
benches
such
as
william
contended
with
to
the
last
we
had
a
one
near
the
front
and
a
stool
to
put
our
feet
on
and
a
library
hooked
to
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
us
containing
a
bulletin
of
the
church
news
i
did
have
time
to
find
the
society
column
but
i
was
looking
for
it
when
the
preacher
came
in
i
expected
to
hear
a
sermon
he
looked
so
much
like
a
tintype
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
but
he
took
his
text
from
mark
about
the
healing
of
the
man
with
the
withered
hand
and
preached
on
the
hypnotism
of
jesus
he
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
miracles
in
the
most
elegant
convincing
language
you
ever
heard
and
i
sat
and
cried
to
think
of
what
done
to
scriptures
william
would
have
died
to
preserve
the
girls
were
mortified
at
the
scene
i
was
making
i
do
reckon
anybody
had
ever
cried
in
that
church
before
and
i
am
sure
no
man
was
ever
convicted
of
his
sins
there
when
we
reached
home
i
told
sarah
about
going
back
to
redwine
first
thing
then
i
came
on
upstairs
and
had
it
out
with
william
in
a
very
few
words
while
i
was
pulling
out
the
dresser
drawers
and
putting
my
things
in
the
trunk
william
i
said
kneeling
down
on
the
floor
with
my
back
to
his
picture
on
my
dresser
laying
my
collars
in
the
tray
you
were
right
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
church
system
something
wrong
with
the
institutional
religion
that
the
church
is
propagating
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
truth
of
god
for
which
you
stood
and
made
me
stand
for
thirty
years
and
i
am
going
back
where
some
of
the
people
know
it
whether
they
know
anything
else
or
not
up
here
the
best
the
wisest
people
do
know
what
the
truth
of
god
is
they
think
they
can
find
it
in
science
faith
is
for
fools
who
can
not
think
they
are
not
trying
to
reconcile
god
to
man
but
man
to
god
and
trimming
down
the
holy
ghost
to
suit
his
scientific
bug
faculties
then
i
reached
back
snatched
up
his
photo
laid
it
bottom
upward
on
top
of
the
collars
i
did
feel
that
i
could
look
him
squarely
in
the
face
till
i
had
it
setting
back
on
the
mantel
in
the
house
at
redwine
i
have
got
the
first
orthodox
methodist
feeling
of
being
backslid
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
it
was
not
going
to
the
theaters
and
tea
parties
that
brought
it
on
it
was
going
to
church
every
sunday
and
hearing
some
preacher
explain
away
the
divinity
of
jesus
or
reduce
his
miracles
to
scientific
formulas
i
do
not
wonder
that
so
many
men
and
women
go
wrong
in
new
york
they
are
orphans
deprived
of
their
heavenly
father
by
the
very
preachers
themselves
and
it
very
hard
for
orphans
to
behave
themselves
they
know
what
is
right
but
righteousness
does
not
appeal
to
them
because
it
has
never
been
sanctified
by
love
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
these
people
they
do
not
love
god
they
do
not
care
or
know
or
believe
that
he
loves
them
they
are
so
sensible
so
profoundly
reasonable
that
they
are
sadly
damned
already
by
their
own
little
intelligences
they
have
theories
views
and
knowledges
that
are
not
going
to
show
up
well
in
the
next
generation
and
that
is
their
crime
to
propagate
ideas
that
will
destroy
the
integrity
of
those
who
will
come
after
them
