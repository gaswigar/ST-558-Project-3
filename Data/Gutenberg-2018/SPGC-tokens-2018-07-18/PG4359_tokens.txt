lombard
street
a
description
of
the
money
market
by
walter
bagehot
chapter
i
introductory
i
venture
to
call
this
essay
street
and
not
the
market
or
any
such
phrase
because
i
wish
to
deal
and
to
show
that
i
mean
to
deal
with
concrete
realities
a
notion
prevails
that
the
money
market
is
something
so
impalpable
that
it
can
only
be
spoken
of
in
very
abstract
words
and
that
therefore
books
on
it
must
always
be
exceedingly
difficult
but
i
maintain
that
the
money
market
is
as
concrete
and
real
as
anything
else
that
it
can
be
described
in
as
plain
words
that
it
is
the
writer
fault
if
what
he
says
is
not
clear
in
one
respect
however
i
admit
that
i
am
about
to
take
perhaps
an
unfair
advantage
half
and
more
than
half
of
the
supposed
of
the
money
market
has
arisen
out
of
the
controversies
as
to
act
and
the
abstract
discussions
on
the
theory
on
which
that
act
is
based
or
supposed
to
be
based
but
in
the
ensuing
pages
i
mean
to
speak
as
little
as
i
can
of
the
act
of
and
when
i
do
speak
of
it
i
shall
deal
nearly
exclusively
with
its
experienced
effects
and
scarcely
at
all
if
at
all
with
its
refined
basis
for
this
i
have
several
reasons
one
that
if
you
say
anything
about
the
act
of
it
is
little
matter
what
else
you
say
for
few
will
attend
to
it
most
critics
will
seize
on
the
passage
as
to
the
act
either
to
attack
it
or
defend
it
as
if
it
were
the
main
point
there
has
been
so
much
fierce
controversy
as
to
this
act
of
parliament
and
there
is
still
so
much
animosity
that
a
single
sentence
respecting
it
is
far
more
interesting
to
very
many
than
a
whole
book
on
any
other
part
of
the
subject
two
hosts
of
eager
disputants
on
this
subject
ask
of
every
new
writer
the
one
question
are
you
with
us
or
against
us
and
they
care
for
little
else
of
course
if
the
act
of
really
were
as
is
commonly
thought
the
of
the
english
money
market
the
source
of
all
good
according
to
some
and
the
source
of
all
harm
according
to
others
the
extreme
irritation
excited
by
an
opinion
on
it
would
be
no
reason
for
not
giving
a
free
opinion
a
writer
on
any
subject
must
not
neglect
its
cardinal
fact
for
fear
that
others
may
abuse
him
but
in
my
judgment
the
act
of
is
only
a
subordinate
matter
in
the
money
market
what
has
to
be
said
on
it
has
been
said
at
disproportionate
length
the
phenomena
connected
with
it
have
been
magnified
into
greater
relative
importance
than
they
at
all
deserve
we
must
never
forget
that
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
passed
since
a
period
singularly
remarkable
for
its
material
progress
and
almost
marvellous
in
its
banking
development
even
therefore
if
the
facts
so
much
referred
to
in
had
the
importance
then
ascribed
to
them
and
i
believe
that
in
some
respects
they
were
even
then
overstated
there
would
be
nothing
surprising
in
finding
that
in
a
new
world
new
phenomena
had
arisen
which
now
are
larger
and
stronger
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
truth
since
lombard
street
is
so
changed
that
we
can
not
judge
of
it
without
describing
and
discussing
a
most
vigorous
adult
world
which
then
was
small
and
weak
on
this
account
i
wish
to
say
as
little
as
is
fairly
possible
of
the
act
of
and
as
far
as
i
can
to
isolate
and
dwell
exclusively
on
the
agencies
so
that
those
who
have
had
enough
of
that
theme
and
they
are
very
many
may
not
be
wearied
and
that
the
new
and
neglected
parts
of
the
subject
may
be
seen
as
they
really
are
the
briefest
and
truest
way
of
describing
lombard
street
is
to
say
that
it
is
by
far
the
greatest
combination
of
economical
power
and
economical
delicacy
that
the
world
has
even
seen
of
the
greatness
of
the
power
there
will
be
no
doubt
money
is
economical
power
everyone
is
aware
that
england
is
the
greatest
moneyed
country
in
the
world
everyone
admits
that
it
has
much
more
immediately
disposable
and
ready
cash
than
any
other
country
but
very
few
persons
are
aware
how
much
greater
the
ready
balance
the
floating
which
can
be
lent
to
anyone
or
for
any
purpose
is
in
england
than
it
is
anywhere
else
in
the
world
a
very
few
figures
will
show
how
large
the
london
is
and
how
much
greater
it
is
than
any
other
the
known
deposits
the
deposits
of
banks
which
publish
their
accounts
are
in
london
december
l
paris
february
l
new
york
february
l
german
empire
january
l
and
the
unknown
deposits
the
deposits
in
banks
which
do
not
publish
their
accounts
are
in
london
much
greater
than
those
many
other
of
these
cities
the
bankers
deposits
of
london
are
many
times
greater
than
those
of
any
other
city
those
of
great
britain
many
times
greater
than
those
of
any
other
country
of
course
the
deposits
of
bankers
are
not
a
strictly
accurate
measure
of
the
resources
of
a
money
market
on
the
contrary
much
more
cash
exists
out
of
banks
in
france
and
germany
and
in
all
countries
than
could
be
found
in
england
or
scotland
where
banking
is
developed
but
that
cash
is
not
so
to
speak
money
it
is
not
attainable
nothing
but
their
immense
misfortunes
nothing
but
a
vast
loan
in
their
own
securities
could
have
extracted
the
hoards
of
france
from
the
custody
of
the
french
people
the
offer
of
no
other
securities
would
have
tempted
them
for
they
had
confidence
in
no
other
securities
for
all
other
purposes
the
money
hoarded
was
useless
and
might
as
well
not
have
been
hoarded
but
the
english
money
is
money
our
people
are
bolder
in
dealing
with
their
money
than
any
continental
nation
and
even
if
they
were
not
bolder
the
mere
fact
that
their
money
is
deposited
in
a
bank
makes
it
far
more
obtainable
a
million
in
the
hands
of
a
single
banker
is
a
great
power
he
can
at
once
lend
it
where
he
will
and
borrowers
can
come
to
him
because
they
know
or
believe
that
he
has
it
but
the
same
sum
scattered
in
tens
and
fifties
through
a
whole
nation
is
no
power
at
all
no
one
knows
where
to
find
it
or
whom
to
ask
for
it
concentration
of
money
in
banks
though
not
the
sole
cause
is
the
principal
cause
which
has
made
the
money
market
of
england
so
exceedingly
rich
so
much
beyond
that
of
other
countries
the
effect
is
seen
constantly
we
are
asked
to
lend
and
do
lend
vast
sums
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
elsewhere
it
is
sometimes
said
that
any
foreign
country
can
borrow
in
lombard
street
at
a
price
some
countries
can
borrow
much
cheaper
than
others
but
all
it
is
said
can
have
some
money
if
they
choose
to
pay
enough
for
it
perhaps
this
is
an
exaggeration
but
confined
as
of
course
it
was
meant
to
be
to
civilised
governments
it
is
not
much
of
an
exaggeration
there
are
very
few
civilised
governments
that
could
not
borrow
considerable
sums
of
us
if
they
choose
and
most
of
them
seem
more
and
more
likely
to
choose
if
any
nation
wants
even
to
make
a
railway
especially
at
all
a
poor
nation
it
is
sure
to
come
to
this
country
to
the
country
of
banks
for
the
money
it
is
true
that
english
bankers
are
not
themselves
very
great
lenders
to
foreign
states
but
they
are
great
lenders
to
those
who
lend
they
advance
on
foreign
stocks
as
the
phrase
is
with
margin
that
is
they
find
eighty
per
cent
of
the
money
and
the
nominal
lender
finds
the
rest
and
it
is
in
this
way
that
vast
works
are
achieved
with
english
aid
which
but
for
that
aid
would
never
have
been
planned
in
domestic
enterprises
it
is
the
same
we
have
entirely
lost
the
idea
that
any
undertaking
likely
to
pay
and
seen
to
be
likely
can
perish
for
want
of
money
yet
no
idea
was
more
familiar
to
our
ancestors
or
is
more
common
now
in
most
countries
a
citizen
of
london
in
queen
elizabeth
time
could
not
have
imagined
our
state
of
mind
he
would
have
thought
that
it
was
of
no
use
inventing
railways
if
he
could
have
understood
what
a
railway
meant
for
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
collect
the
capital
with
which
to
make
them
at
this
moment
in
colonies
and
all
rude
countries
there
is
no
large
sum
of
transferable
money
there
is
no
fund
from
which
you
can
borrow
and
out
of
which
you
can
make
immense
works
taking
the
world
as
a
whole
either
now
or
in
the
past
it
is
certain
that
in
poor
states
there
is
no
spare
money
for
new
and
great
undertakings
and
that
in
most
rich
states
the
money
is
too
scattered
and
clings
too
close
to
the
hands
of
the
owners
to
be
often
obtainable
in
large
quantities
for
new
purposes
a
place
like
lombard
street
where
in
all
but
the
rarest
times
money
can
be
always
obtained
upon
good
security
or
upon
decent
prospects
of
probable
gain
is
a
luxury
which
no
country
has
ever
enjoyed
with
even
comparable
equality
before
but
though
these
occasional
loans
to
new
enterprises
and
foreign
states
are
the
most
conspicuous
instances
of
the
power
of
lombard
street
they
are
not
by
any
means
the
most
remarkable
or
the
most
important
use
of
that
power
english
trade
is
carried
on
upon
borrowed
capital
to
an
extent
of
which
few
foreigners
have
an
idea
and
none
of
our
ancestors
could
have
conceived
in
every
district
small
traders
have
arisen
who
their
bills
largely
and
with
the
capital
so
borrowed
harass
and
press
upon
if
they
do
not
eradicate
the
old
capitalist
the
new
trader
has
obviously
an
immense
advantage
in
the
struggle
of
trade
if
a
merchant
have
all
his
own
to
gain
per
cent
on
it
he
must
make
a
year
and
must
charge
for
his
goods
accordingly
but
if
another
has
only
and
borrows
by
discounts
no
extreme
instance
in
our
modern
trade
he
has
the
same
capital
of
to
use
and
can
sell
much
cheaper
if
the
rate
at
which
he
borrows
be
per
he
will
have
to
pay
a
year
and
if
like
the
old
trader
he
make
a
year
he
will
still
after
paying
his
interest
obtain
a
year
or
per
cent
on
his
own
as
most
merchants
are
content
with
much
less
than
per
cent
he
will
be
able
if
he
wishes
to
forego
some
of
that
profit
lower
the
price
of
the
commodity
and
drive
the
trader
the
man
who
trades
on
his
own
capital
out
of
the
market
in
modern
english
business
owing
to
the
certainty
of
obtaining
loans
on
discount
of
bills
or
otherwise
at
a
moderate
rate
of
interest
there
is
a
steady
bounty
on
trading
with
borrowed
capital
and
a
constant
discouragement
to
confine
yourself
solely
or
mainly
to
your
own
capital
this
increasingly
democratic
structure
of
english
commerce
is
very
unpopular
in
many
quarters
and
its
effects
are
no
doubt
exceedingly
mixed
on
the
one
hand
it
prevents
the
long
duration
of
great
families
of
merchant
princes
such
as
those
of
venice
and
genoa
who
inherited
nice
cultivation
as
well
as
great
wealth
and
who
to
some
extent
combined
the
tastes
of
an
aristocracy
with
the
insight
and
verve
of
men
of
business
these
are
pushed
out
so
to
say
by
the
dirty
crowd
of
little
men
after
a
generation
or
two
they
retire
into
idle
luxury
upon
their
immense
capital
they
can
only
obtain
low
profits
and
these
they
do
not
think
enough
to
compensate
them
for
the
rough
companions
and
rude
manners
they
must
meet
in
business
this
constant
levelling
of
our
commercial
houses
is
too
unfavourable
to
commercial
morality
great
firms
with
a
reputation
which
they
have
received
from
the
past
and
which
they
wish
to
transmit
to
the
future
can
not
be
guilty
of
small
frauds
they
live
by
a
continuity
of
trade
which
detected
fraud
would
spoil
when
we
scrutinise
the
reason
of
the
impaired
reputation
of
english
goods
we
find
it
is
the
fault
of
new
men
with
little
money
of
their
own
created
by
bank
these
men
want
business
at
once
and
they
produce
an
inferior
article
to
get
it
they
rely
on
cheapness
and
rely
successfully
but
these
defects
and
others
in
the
democratic
structure
of
commerce
are
compensated
by
one
great
excellence
no
country
of
great
hereditary
trade
no
european
country
at
least
was
ever
so
little
to
use
the
only
fit
word
as
england
no
other
was
ever
so
prompt
at
once
to
seize
new
advantages
a
country
dependent
mainly
on
great
princes
will
never
be
so
prompt
their
commerce
perpetually
slips
more
and
more
into
a
commerce
of
routine
a
man
of
large
wealth
however
intelligent
always
thinks
more
or
less
have
a
great
income
and
i
want
to
keep
it
if
things
go
on
as
they
are
i
shall
certainly
keep
it
but
if
they
change
i
may
not
keep
it
consequently
he
considers
every
change
of
circumstance
a
and
thinks
of
such
changes
as
little
as
he
can
but
a
new
man
who
has
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
knows
that
such
changes
are
his
opportunities
he
is
always
on
the
for
them
and
always
heeds
them
when
he
finds
them
the
rough
and
vulgar
structure
of
english
commerce
is
the
secret
of
its
life
for
it
contains
propensity
to
variation
which
in
the
social
as
in
the
animal
kingdom
is
the
principle
of
progress
in
this
constant
and
chronic
borrowing
lombard
street
is
the
great
it
is
a
sort
of
standing
broker
between
quiet
saving
districts
of
the
country
and
the
active
employing
districts
why
particular
trades
settled
in
particular
places
it
is
often
difficult
to
say
but
one
thing
is
certain
that
when
a
trade
has
settled
in
any
one
spot
it
is
very
difficult
for
another
to
oust
it
impossible
unless
the
second
place
possesses
some
very
great
intrinsic
advantage
commerce
is
curiously
conservative
in
its
homes
unless
it
is
imperiously
obliged
to
migrate
partly
from
this
cause
and
partly
from
others
there
are
whole
districts
in
england
which
can
not
and
do
not
employ
their
own
money
no
purely
agricultural
county
does
so
the
savings
of
a
county
with
good
land
but
no
manufactures
and
no
trade
much
exceed
what
can
be
safely
lent
in
the
county
these
savings
are
first
lodged
in
the
local
banks
are
by
them
sent
to
london
and
are
deposited
with
london
bankers
or
with
the
bill
brokers
in
either
case
the
result
is
the
same
the
money
thus
sent
up
from
the
accumulating
districts
is
employed
in
discounting
the
bills
of
the
industrial
districts
deposits
are
made
with
the
bankers
and
bill
brokers
in
lombard
street
by
the
bankers
of
such
counties
as
somersetshire
and
hampshire
and
those
bill
brokers
and
bankers
employ
them
in
the
discount
of
bills
from
yorkshire
and
lancashire
lombard
street
is
thus
a
perpetual
agent
between
the
two
great
divisions
of
england
between
the
districts
where
almost
any
amount
of
money
can
be
well
and
easily
employed
and
the
stationary
and
the
declining
districts
where
there
is
more
money
than
can
be
used
this
organisation
is
so
useful
because
it
is
so
easily
adjusted
political
economists
say
that
capital
sets
towards
the
most
profitable
trades
and
that
it
rapidly
leaves
the
less
profitable
and
trades
but
in
ordinary
countries
this
is
a
slow
process
and
some
persons
who
want
to
have
ocular
demonstration
of
abstract
truths
have
been
inclined
to
doubt
it
because
they
could
not
see
it
in
england
however
the
process
would
be
visible
enough
if
you
could
only
see
the
books
of
the
bill
brokers
and
the
bankers
their
bill
cases
as
a
rule
are
full
of
the
bills
drawn
in
the
most
profitable
trades
and
and
in
comparison
empty
of
those
drawn
in
the
less
profitable
if
the
iron
trade
ceases
to
be
as
profitable
as
usual
less
iron
is
sold
the
fewer
the
sales
the
fewer
the
bills
and
in
consequence
the
number
of
iron
bills
in
lombard
street
is
diminished
on
the
other
hand
if
in
consequence
of
a
bad
harvest
the
corn
trade
becomes
on
a
sudden
profitable
immediately
bills
are
created
in
great
numbers
and
if
good
are
discounted
in
lombard
street
thus
english
capital
runs
as
surely
and
instantly
where
it
is
most
wanted
and
where
there
is
most
to
be
made
of
it
as
water
runs
to
find
its
level
this
efficient
and
organisation
gives
us
an
enormous
advantage
in
competition
with
less
advanced
countries
less
advanced
that
is
in
this
particular
respect
of
credit
in
a
new
trade
english
capital
is
instantly
at
the
disposal
of
persons
capable
of
understanding
the
new
opportunities
and
of
making
good
use
of
them
in
countries
where
there
is
little
money
to
lend
and
where
that
little
is
lent
tardily
and
reluctantly
enterprising
traders
are
long
kept
back
because
they
can
not
at
once
borrow
the
capital
without
which
skill
and
knowledge
are
useless
all
sudden
trades
come
to
england
and
in
so
doing
often
disappoint
both
rational
probability
and
the
predictions
of
philosophers
the
suez
canal
is
a
curious
case
of
this
all
predicted
that
the
canal
would
undo
what
the
discovery
of
the
passage
to
india
round
the
cape
effected
before
that
all
oriental
trade
went
to
ports
in
the
south
of
europe
and
was
thence
diffused
through
europe
that
london
and
liverpool
should
be
centres
of
east
indian
commerce
is
a
geographical
anomaly
which
the
suez
canal
it
was
said
would
rectify
greeks
said
de
tocqueville
styrians
the
italians
the
dalmatians
and
the
sicilians
are
the
people
who
will
use
the
canal
if
any
use
it
but
on
the
contrary
the
main
use
of
the
canal
has
been
by
the
english
none
of
the
nations
named
by
tocqueville
had
the
capital
or
a
tithe
of
it
ready
to
build
the
large
screw
steamers
which
alone
can
use
the
canal
profitably
ultimately
these
plausible
predictions
may
or
may
not
be
right
but
as
yet
they
have
been
quite
wrong
not
because
england
has
rich
people
there
are
wealthy
people
in
all
countries
but
because
she
possesses
an
unequalled
fund
of
floating
money
which
will
help
in
a
moment
any
merchant
who
sees
a
great
prospect
of
new
profit
and
not
only
does
this
unconscious
of
capital
to
use
a
continental
phrase
make
the
english
specially
quick
in
comparison
with
their
neighbours
on
the
continent
at
seizing
on
novel
mercantile
opportunities
but
it
makes
them
likely
also
to
retain
any
trade
on
which
they
have
once
regularly
fastened
macculloch
following
ricardo
used
to
teach
that
all
old
nations
had
a
special
aptitude
for
trades
in
which
much
capital
is
required
the
interest
of
capital
having
been
reduced
in
such
countries
he
argued
by
the
necessity
of
continually
resorting
to
inferior
soils
they
can
undersell
countries
where
profit
is
high
in
all
trades
needing
great
capital
and
in
this
theory
there
is
doubtless
much
truth
though
it
can
only
be
applied
in
practice
after
a
number
of
limitations
and
with
a
number
of
deductions
of
which
the
older
school
of
political
economists
did
not
take
enough
notice
but
the
same
principle
plainly
and
practically
applies
to
england
in
consequence
of
her
habitual
use
of
borrowed
capital
as
has
been
explained
a
new
man
with
a
small
capital
of
his
own
and
a
large
borrowed
capital
can
undersell
a
rich
man
who
depends
on
his
own
capital
only
the
rich
man
wants
the
full
rate
of
mercantile
profit
on
the
whole
of
the
capital
employed
in
his
trade
but
the
poor
man
wants
only
the
interest
of
money
perhaps
not
a
third
of
the
rate
of
profit
on
very
much
of
what
he
uses
and
therefore
an
income
will
be
an
ample
recompense
to
the
poor
man
which
would
starve
the
rich
man
out
of
the
trade
all
the
common
notions
about
the
new
competition
of
foreign
countries
with
england
and
its
dangers
notions
in
which
there
is
in
other
aspects
much
truth
require
to
be
reconsidered
in
relation
to
this
aspect
england
has
a
special
machinery
for
getting
into
trade
new
men
who
will
be
content
with
low
prices
and
this
machinery
will
probably
secure
her
success
for
no
other
country
is
soon
likely
to
rival
it
effectually
there
are
many
other
points
which
might
be
insisted
on
but
it
would
be
tedious
and
useless
to
elaborate
the
picture
the
main
conclusion
is
very
plain
that
english
trade
is
become
essentially
a
trade
on
borrowed
capital
and
that
it
is
only
by
this
refinement
of
our
banking
system
that
we
are
able
to
do
the
sort
of
trade
we
do
or
to
get
through
the
quantity
of
it
but
in
exact
proportion
to
the
power
of
this
system
is
its
delicacy
i
should
hardly
say
too
much
if
i
said
its
danger
only
our
familiarity
blinds
us
to
the
marvellous
nature
of
the
system
there
never
was
so
much
borrowed
money
collected
in
the
world
as
is
now
collected
in
london
of
the
many
millions
in
lombard
street
infinitely
the
greater
proportion
is
held
by
bankers
or
others
on
short
notice
or
on
demand
that
is
to
say
the
owners
could
ask
for
it
all
any
day
they
please
in
a
panic
some
of
them
do
ask
for
some
of
it
if
any
large
fraction
of
that
money
really
was
demanded
our
banking
system
and
our
industrial
system
too
would
be
in
great
danger
some
of
those
deposits
too
are
of
a
peculiar
and
very
distinct
nature
since
the
war
we
have
become
to
a
much
larger
extent
than
before
the
bankers
of
europe
a
very
large
sum
of
foreign
money
is
on
various
accounts
and
for
various
purposes
held
here
and
in
a
time
of
panic
it
might
be
asked
for
in
we
held
only
a
much
smaller
sum
of
foreign
money
but
that
smaller
sum
was
demanded
and
we
had
to
pay
it
at
great
cost
and
suffering
and
it
would
be
far
worse
if
we
had
to
pay
the
greater
sums
we
now
hold
without
better
resources
than
we
had
then
it
may
be
replied
that
though
our
instant
liabilities
are
great
our
present
means
are
large
that
though
we
have
much
we
may
be
asked
to
pay
at
any
moment
we
have
very
much
always
ready
to
pay
it
with
but
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
country
at
present
and
there
never
was
any
country
before
in
which
the
ratio
of
the
cash
reserve
to
the
bank
deposits
was
so
small
as
it
is
now
in
england
so
far
from
our
being
able
to
rely
on
the
proportional
magnitude
of
our
cash
in
hand
the
amount
of
that
cash
is
so
exceedingly
small
that
a
bystander
almost
trembles
when
he
compares
its
minuteness
with
the
immensity
of
the
credit
which
rests
upon
it
again
it
may
be
said
that
we
need
not
be
alarmed
at
the
magnitude
of
our
credit
system
or
at
its
refinement
for
that
we
have
learned
by
experience
the
way
of
controlling
it
and
always
manage
it
with
discretion
but
we
do
not
always
manage
it
with
discretion
there
is
the
astounding
instance
of
overend
gurney
and
to
the
contrary
ten
years
ago
that
house
stood
next
to
the
bank
of
england
in
the
city
of
london
it
was
better
known
abroad
than
any
similar
firm
known
perhaps
better
than
any
purely
english
firm
the
partners
had
great
estates
which
had
mostly
been
made
in
the
business
they
still
derived
an
immense
income
from
it
yet
in
six
years
they
lost
all
their
own
wealth
sold
the
business
to
the
company
and
then
lost
a
large
part
of
the
company
capital
and
these
losses
were
made
in
a
manner
so
reckless
and
so
foolish
that
one
would
think
a
child
who
had
lent
money
in
the
city
of
london
would
have
lent
it
better
after
this
example
we
must
not
confide
too
surely
in
credit
or
in
traditions
of
business
we
must
examine
the
system
on
which
these
great
masses
of
money
are
manipulated
and
assure
ourselves
that
it
is
safe
and
right
but
it
is
not
easy
to
rouse
men
of
business
to
the
task
they
let
the
tide
of
business
float
before
them
they
make
money
or
strive
to
do
so
while
it
passes
and
they
are
unwilling
to
think
where
it
is
going
even
the
great
collapse
of
overends
though
it
caused
a
panic
is
beginning
to
be
forgotten
most
men
of
business
think
this
system
will
probably
last
my
time
it
has
gone
on
a
long
time
and
is
likely
to
go
on
still
but
the
exact
point
is
that
it
has
not
gone
on
a
long
time
the
collection
of
these
immense
sums
in
one
place
and
in
few
hands
is
perfectly
new
in
the
liabilities
of
the
four
great
london
joint
stock
banks
were
they
now
are
more
than
the
private
deposits
of
the
bank
of
england
then
were
they
now
are
there
was
in
throughout
the
country
but
a
fraction
of
the
vast
deposit
business
which
now
exists
we
can
not
appeal
therefore
to
experience
to
prove
the
safety
of
our
system
as
it
now
is
for
the
present
magnitude
of
that
system
is
entirely
new
obviously
a
system
may
be
fit
to
regulate
a
few
millions
and
yet
quite
inadequate
when
it
is
set
to
cope
with
many
millions
and
thus
it
may
be
with
street
so
rapid
has
been
its
growth
and
so
unprecedented
is
its
nature
i
am
by
no
means
an
alarmist
i
believe
that
our
system
though
curious
and
peculiar
may
be
worked
safely
but
if
we
wish
so
to
work
it
we
must
study
it
we
must
not
think
we
have
an
easy
task
when
we
have
a
difficult
task
or
that
we
are
living
in
a
natural
state
when
we
are
really
living
in
an
artificial
one
money
will
not
manage
itself
and
lombard
street
has
a
great
deal
of
money
to
manage
chapter
ii
a
general
view
of
lombard
street
i
the
objects
which
you
see
in
lombard
street
and
in
that
money
world
which
is
grouped
about
it
are
the
bank
of
england
the
private
banks
the
joint
stock
banks
and
the
bill
brokers
but
before
describing
each
of
these
separately
we
must
look
at
what
all
have
in
common
and
at
the
relation
of
each
to
the
others
the
distinctive
function
of
the
banker
says
ricardo
as
soon
as
he
uses
the
money
of
others
as
long
as
he
uses
his
own
money
he
is
only
a
capitalist
accordingly
all
the
banks
in
lombard
street
and
bill
brokers
are
for
this
purpose
only
a
kind
of
bankers
hold
much
money
belonging
to
other
people
on
running
account
and
on
deposit
in
continental
language
lombard
street
is
an
organization
of
credit
and
we
are
to
see
if
it
is
a
good
or
bad
organization
in
its
kind
or
if
as
is
most
likely
it
turn
out
to
be
mixed
what
are
its
merits
and
what
are
its
defects
the
main
point
on
which
one
system
of
credit
differs
from
another
is
credit
means
that
a
certain
confidence
is
given
and
a
certain
trust
reposed
is
that
trust
justified
and
is
that
confidence
wise
these
are
the
cardinal
questions
to
put
it
more
simply
credit
is
a
set
of
promises
to
pay
will
those
promises
be
kept
especially
in
banking
where
the
or
promises
to
pay
are
so
large
and
the
time
at
which
to
pay
them
if
exacted
is
so
short
an
instant
capacity
to
meet
engagements
is
the
cardinal
excellence
all
which
a
banker
wants
to
pay
his
creditors
is
a
sufficient
supply
of
the
legal
tender
of
the
country
no
matter
what
that
legal
tender
may
be
different
countries
differ
in
their
laws
of
legal
tender
but
for
the
primary
purposes
of
banking
these
systems
are
not
material
a
good
system
of
currency
will
benefit
the
country
and
a
bad
system
will
hurt
it
indirectly
bankers
will
be
benefited
or
injured
with
the
country
in
which
they
live
but
practically
and
for
the
purposes
of
their
daily
life
they
have
no
need
to
think
and
never
do
think
on
theories
of
currency
they
look
at
the
matter
simply
they
say
am
under
an
obligation
to
pay
such
and
such
sums
of
legal
currency
how
much
have
i
in
my
till
or
have
i
at
once
under
my
command
of
that
currency
in
america
for
example
it
is
quite
enough
for
a
banker
to
hold
though
the
value
of
these
changes
as
the
government
chooses
to
enlarge
or
contract
the
issue
but
a
practical
new
york
banker
has
no
need
to
think
of
the
goodness
or
badness
of
this
system
at
all
he
need
only
keep
enough
to
pay
all
probable
demands
and
then
he
is
fairly
safe
from
the
risk
of
failure
by
the
law
of
england
the
legal
tenders
are
gold
and
silver
coin
the
last
for
small
amounts
only
and
bank
of
england
notes
but
the
number
of
our
attainable
bank
notes
is
not
like
american
dependent
on
the
will
of
the
state
it
is
limited
by
the
provisions
of
the

of
that

separates
the

in
any

manner
it

and
for
all
the

this
is
the
iron
system
the
and
fast
line
which
the
opponents
of

say
ruins
us
and
which
the
partizans
of
the
act
say
saves
us
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
expediency
here
all
which
is
to
my
purpose
is
that
our
paper
tender
our
bank
notes
can
only
be
obtained
in
this
manner
if
therefore
an
english
banker
retains
a
sum
of
bank
of
england
notes
or
coin
in
due
proportion
to
his
liabilities
he
has
a
sufficient
amount
of
the
legal
tender
of
this
country
and
he
need
not
think
of
anything
more
but
here
a
distinction
must
be
made
it
is
to
be
observed
that
properly
speaking
we
should
not
include
in
the
of
a
bank
tenders
or
cash
which
the
bank
keeps
to
transact
its
daily
business
that
is
as
much
a
part
of
its
daily
as
its
desks
or
offices
or
at
any
rate
whatever
words
we
may
choose
to
use
we
must
carefully
distinguish
between
this
cash
in
the
till
which
is
wanted
every
day
and
the
as
we
may
call
it
the
special
reserve
held
by
the
bank
to
meet
extraordinary
and
unfrequent
demands
what
then
subject
to
this
preliminary
explanation
is
the
amount
of
legal
tender
held
by
our
bankers
against
their
liabilities
the
answer
is
remarkable
and
is
the
key
to
our
whole
system
it
may
be
broadly
said
that
no
bank
in
london
or
out
of
it
holds
any
considerable
sum
in
hard
cash
or
legal
tender
above
what
is
wanted
for
its
daily
business
except
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
that
department
had
on
the
day
of
december
liabilities
as
follows
public
deposits
l
private
deposits
l
and
other
bills
l
total
l
and
a
cash
reserve
of
and
this
is
all
the
cash
reserve
we
must
carefully
remember
which
under
the
law
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
as
we
cumbrously
call
it
the
bank
of
england
for
banking
purposes
possesses
that
department
can
no
more
multiply
or
manufacture
bank
notes
than
any
other
bank
can
multiply
them
at
that
particular
day
the
bank
of
england
had
only
in
its
till
against
liabilities
of
nearly
three
times
the
amount
it
had
and
other
securities
which
it
could
offer
for
sale
no
doubt
and
which
if
sold
would
augment
its
supply
of
bank
notes
and
the
relation
of
such
securities
to
real
cash
will
be
discussed
presently
but
of
real
cash
the
bank
of
england
for
this
purpose
the
banking
bank
had
then
so
much
and
no
more
and
we
may
well
think
this
a
great
deal
if
we
examine
the
position
of
other
banks
no
other
bank
holds
any
amount
of
substantial
importance
in
its
own
till
beyond
what
is
wanted
for
daily
purposes
all
london
banks
keep
their
principal
reserve
on
deposit
at
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
and
safest
place
for
them
to
use
the
bank
of
england
thus
has
the
responsibility
of
taking
care
of
it
the
same
reasons
which
make
it
desirable
for
a
private
person
to
keep
a
banker
make
it
also
desirable
for
every
banker
as
respects
his
reserve
to
bank
with
another
banker
if
he
safely
can
the
custody
of
very
large
sums
in
solid
cash
entails
much
care
and
some
cost
everyone
wishes
to
shift
these
upon
others
if
he
can
do
so
without
suffering
accordingly
the
other
bankers
of
london
having
perfect
confidence
in
the
bank
of
england
get
that
bank
to
keep
their
reserve
for
them
the
london
bill
brokers
do
much
the
same
indeed
they
are
only
a
special
sort
of
bankers
who
allow
daily
interest
on
deposits
and
who
for
most
of
their
money
give
security
but
we
have
no
concern
now
with
these
differences
of
detail
the
bill
brokers
lend
most
of
their
money
and
deposit
the
remnant
either
with
the
bank
of
england
or
some
london
banker
that
london
banker
lends
what
he
chooses
of
it
the
rest
he
leaves
at
the
bank
of
england
you
always
come
back
to
the
bank
of
england
at
last
but
those
who
keep
immense
sums
with
a
banker
gain
a
convenience
at
the
expense
of
a
danger
they
are
liable
to
lose
them
if
the
bank
fail
as
all
other
bankers
keep
their
banking
reserve
at
the
bank
of
england
they
are
liable
to
fail
if
it
fails
they
are
dependent
on
the
management
of
the
bank
of
england
in
a
day
of
difficulty
and
at
a
crisis
for
the
spare
money
they
keep
to
meet
that
difficulty
and
crisis
and
in
this
there
is
certainly
considerable
risk
three
times
act
has
been
suspended
because
the
banking
department
was
empty
before
the
act
was
broken
in
the
banking
department
was
reduced
to
l
l
l
in
fact
in
none
of
those
years
could
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
have
survived
if
the
law
had
not
been
broken
nor
must
it
be
fancied
that
this
danger
is
unreal
artificial
and
created
by
law
there
is
a
risk
of
our
thinking
so
because
we
hear
that
the
danger
can
be
cured
by
breaking
an
act
but
substantially
the
same
danger
existed
before
the
act
in
when
only
coin
was
a
legal
tender
and
when
there
was
only
one
department
in
the
bank
the
bank
had
reduced
its
reserve
to
and
was
within
an
ace
of
stopping
payment
but
the
danger
to
the
depositing
banks
is
not
the
sole
or
the
principal
consequence
of
this
mode
of
keeping
the
london
reserve
the
main
effect
is
to
cause
the
reserve
to
be
much
smaller
in
proportion
to
the
liabilities
than
it
would
otherwise
be
the
reserve
of
the
london
bankers
being
on
deposit
in
the
bank
of
england
the
bank
always
lends
a
principal
part
of
it
suppose
a
favourable
supposition
that
the
banking
department
holds
more
than
of
its
liabilities
in
cash
that
it
lends
of
its
deposits
and
retains
in
reserve
only
if
then
the
aggregate
of
the
bankers
deposited
reserve
be
of
it
will
be
lent
by
the
banking
department
and
will
be
kept
in
the
till
in
consequence
that
is
all
which
is
really
held
in
actual
cash
as
against
the
liabilities
of
the
depositing
banks
if
lombard
street
were
on
a
sudden
thrown
into
liquidation
and
made
to
pay
as
much
as
it
could
on
the
spot
that
would
be
all
which
the
bank
of
england
could
pay
to
the
depositing
banks
and
consequently
all
besides
the
small
cash
in
the
till
which
those
banks
could
on
a
sudden
pay
to
the
persons
who
have
deposited
with
them
we
see
then
that
the
banking
reserve
of
the
bank
of
england
some
on
an
average
of
years
now
and
formerly
much
less
is
all
which
is
held
against
the
liabilities
of
lombard
street
and
if
that
were
all
we
might
well
be
amazed
at
the
immense
development
of
our
credit
system
in
plain
english
at
the
immense
amount
of
our
debts
payable
on
demand
and
the
smallness
of
the
sum
of
actual
money
which
we
keep
to
pay
them
if
demanded
but
there
is
more
to
come
lombard
street
is
not
only
a
place
requiring
to
keep
a
reserve
it
is
itself
a
place
where
reserves
are
kept
all
country
bankers
keep
their
reserve
in
london
they
only
retain
in
each
country
town
the
minimum
of
cash
necessary
to
the
transaction
of
the
current
business
of
that
country
town
long
experience
has
told
them
to
a
nicety
how
much
this
is
and
they
do
not
waste
capital
and
lose
profit
by
keeping
more
idle
they
send
the
money
to
london
invest
a
part
of
it
in
securities
and
keep
the
rest
with
the
london
bankers
and
the
bill
brokers
the
habit
of
scotch
and
irish
bankers
is
much
the
same
all
their
spare
money
is
in
london
and
is
invested
as
all
other
london
money
now
is
and
therefore
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
is
the
banking
reserve
not
only
of
the
bank
of
england
but
of
all
london
and
not
only
of
all
london
but
of
all
england
ireland
and
scotland
too
of
late
there
has
been
a
still
further
increase
in
our
liabilities
since
the
war
we
may
be
said
to
keep
the
european
reserve
also
deposit
banking
is
indeed
so
small
on
the
continent
that
no
large
reserve
need
be
held
on
account
of
it
a
reserve
of
the
same
sort
which
is
needed
in
england
and
scotland
is
not
needed
abroad
but
all
great
communities
have
at
times
to
pay
large
sums
in
cash
and
of
that
cash
a
great
store
must
be
kept
somewhere
formerly
there
were
two
such
stores
in
europe
one
was
the
bank
of
france
and
the
other
the
bank
of
england
but
since
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
the
bank
of
france
its
use
as
a
reservoir
of
specie
is
at
an
end
no
one
can
draw
a
cheque
on
it
and
be
sure
of
getting
gold
or
silver
for
that
cheque
accordingly
the
whole
liability
for
such
international
payments
in
cash
is
thrown
on
the
bank
of
england
no
doubt
foreigners
can
not
take
from
us
our
own
money
they
must
send
here
in
some
shape
or
other
for
all
they
take
away
but
they
need
not
send
they
may
send
good
bills
and
discount
them
in
lombard
street
and
take
away
any
part
of
the
produce
or
all
the
produce
in
bullion
it
is
only
putting
the
same
point
in
other
words
to
say
that
all
exchange
operations
are
centering
more
and
more
in
london
formerly
for
many
purposes
paris
was
a
european
but
now
it
has
ceased
to
be
so
the
note
of
the
bank
of
france
has
not
indeed
been
depreciated
enough
to
disorder
ordinary
transactions
but
any
depreciation
however
small
even
the
liability
to
depreciation
without
its
reality
is
enough
to
disorder
exchange
transactions
they
are
calculated
to
such
an
extremity
of
fineness
that
the
change
of
a
decimal
may
be
fatal
and
may
turn
a
profit
into
a
loss
accordingly
london
has
become
the
sole
great
of
exchange
transactions
in
europe
instead
of
being
formerly
one
of
two
and
this
london
will
probably
maintain
for
it
is
a
natural
the
number
of
mercantile
bills
drawn
upon
london
incalculably
surpasses
those
drawn
on
any
other
european
city
london
is
the
place
which
receives
more
than
any
other
place
and
pays
more
than
any
other
place
and
therefore
it
is
the
natural
house
the
of
paris
partly
arose
from
a
distribution
of
political
power
which
is
already
disturbed
but
that
of
london
depends
on
the
regular
course
of
commerce
which
is
singularly
stable
and
hard
to
change
now
that
london
is
the
to
foreign
countries
london
has
a
new
liability
to
foreign
countries
at
whatever
place
many
people
have
to
make
payments
at
that
place
those
people
must
keep
money
a
large
deposit
of
foreign
money
in
london
is
now
necessary
for
the
business
of
the
world
during
the
immense
payments
from
france
to
germany
the
sum
the
sum
in
london
has
perhaps
been
unusually
large
but
it
will
ordinarily
be
very
great
the
present
political
circumstances
no
doubt
will
soon
change
we
shall
soon
hold
in
lombard
street
far
less
of
the
money
of
foreign
governments
but
we
shall
hold
more
and
more
of
the
money
of
private
persons
for
the
deposit
at
a
necessary
to
settle
the
balance
of
commerce
must
tend
to
increase
as
that
commerce
itself
increases
and
this
foreign
deposit
is
evidently
of
a
delicate
and
peculiar
nature
it
depends
on
the
good
opinion
of
foreigners
and
that
opinion
may
diminish
or
may
change
into
a
bad
opinion
after
the
panic
of
especially
after
the
suspension
of
peel
act
which
many
foreigners
confound
with
a
suspension
of
cash
payments
a
large
amount
of
foreign
money
was
withdrawn
from
london
and
we
may
reasonably
presume
that
in
proportion
as
we
augment
the
deposits
of
cash
by
foreigners
in
london
we
augment
both
the
chances
and
the
disasters
of
a
upon
england
and
if
that
run
should
happen
the
bullion
to
meet
it
must
be
taken
from
the
bank
there
is
no
other
large
store
in
the
country
the
great
exchange
dealers
may
have
a
little
for
their
own
purposes
but
they
have
no
store
worth
mentioning
in
comparison
with
this
if
a
foreign
creditor
is
so
kind
as
to
wait
his
time
and
buy
the
bullion
as
it
comes
into
the
country
he
may
be
paid
without
troubling
the
bank
or
distressing
the
money
market
the
german
government
has
recently
been
so
kind
it
was
in
no
respect
afraid
but
a
creditor
who
takes
fright
will
not
wait
and
if
he
wants
bullion
in
a
hurry
he
must
come
to
the
bank
of
england
in
consequence
all
our
credit
system
depends
on
the
bank
of
england
for
its
security
on
the
wisdom
of
the
directors
of
that
one
joint
stock
company
it
depends
whether
england
shall
be
solvent
or
insolvent
this
may
seem
too
strong
but
it
is
not
all
banks
depend
on
the
bank
of
england
and
all
merchants
depend
on
some
banker
if
a
merchant
have
at
his
bankers
and
wants
to
pay
it
to
some
one
in
germany
he
will
not
be
able
to
pay
it
unless
his
banker
can
pay
him
and
the
banker
will
not
be
able
to
pay
if
the
bank
of
england
should
be
in
difficulties
and
can
not
produce
his
the
directors
of
the
bank
are
therefore
in
fact
if
not
in
name
trustees
for
the
public
to
keep
a
banking
reserve
on
their
behalf
and
it
would
naturally
be
expected
either
that
they
distinctly
recognized
this
duty
and
engaged
to
perform
it
or
that
their
own
was
so
strong
in
the
matter
that
no
engagement
was
needed
but
so
far
from
there
being
a
distinct
undertaking
on
the
part
of
the
bank
directors
to
perform
this
duty
many
of
them
would
scarcely
acknowledge
it
and
some
altogether
deny
it
hankey
one
of
the
most
careful
and
most
experienced
of
them
says
in
his
book
on
the
bank
of
england
the
best
account
of
the
practice
and
working
of
the
bank
which
anywhere
exists
do
not
intend
here
to
enter
at
any
length
on
the
subject
of
the
general
management
of
the
bank
meaning
the
banking
department
as
the
principle
upon
which
the
business
is
conducted
does
not
differ
as
far
as
i
am
aware
from
that
of
any
bank
in
london
but
as
anyone
can
see
by
the
published
figures
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
keeps
as
a
great
reserve
in
bank
notes
and
coin
between
and
per
cent
of
its
liabilities
and
the
other
banks
only
keep
in
bank
notes
and
coin
the
bare
minimum
they
need
to
open
shop
with
and
such
a
constant
difference
indicates
i
conceive
that
the
two
are
not
managed
on
the
same
principle
the
practice
of
the
bank
has
as
we
all
know
been
much
and
greatly
improved
they
do
not
now
manage
like
the
other
banks
in
lombard
street
they
keep
an
altogether
different
kind
and
quantity
of
reserve
but
though
the
practice
is
mended
the
theory
is
not
there
has
never
been
a
distinct
resolution
passed
by
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
and
communicated
by
them
to
the
public
stating
even
in
the
most
general
manner
how
much
reserve
they
mean
to
keep
or
how
much
they
do
not
mean
or
by
what
principle
in
this
important
matter
they
will
be
guided
the
position
of
the
bank
directors
is
indeed
most
singular
on
the
one
side
a
great
city
opinion
a
great
national
opinion
i
may
say
for
the
nation
has
learnt
much
from
many
panics
requires
the
directors
to
keep
a
large
reserve
the
newspapers
on
behalf
of
the
nation
are
always
warning
the
directors
to
keep
it
and
watching
that
they
do
keep
it
but
on
the
other
hand
another
less
visible
but
equally
constant
pressure
pushes
the
directors
in
exactly
the
reverse
way
and
inclines
them
to
diminish
the
reserve
this
is
the
natural
desire
of
all
directors
to
make
a
good
dividend
for
their
shareholders
the
more
money
lying
idle
the
less
is
the
dividend
the
less
money
lying
idle
the
greater
is
the
dividend
and
at
almost
every
meeting
of
the
proprietors
of
the
bank
of
england
there
is
a
conversation
on
this
subject
some
proprietor
says
that
he
does
not
see
why
so
much
money
is
kept
idle
and
hints
that
the
dividend
ought
to
be
more
indeed
it
can
not
be
wondered
at
that
the
bank
proprietors
do
not
quite
like
their
position
theirs
is
the
oldest
bank
in
the
city
but
their
profits
do
not
increase
while
those
of
other
banks
most
rapidly
increase
in
the
dividend
on
the
stock
of
the
bank
of
england
was
per
cent
and
the
price
of
the
stock
itself
the
dividend
now
is
per
cent
and
the
price
of
the
stock
but
in
the
same
time
the
shares
of
the
london
and
westminster
bank
in
spite
of
an
addition
of
per
cent
to
the
capital
have
risen
from
to
and
the
dividend
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
that
the
bank
proprietors
should
not
like
to
see
other
companies
getting
richer
than
their
company
is
only
natural
some
part
of
the
lowness
of
the
bank
dividend
and
of
the
consequent
small
value
of
bank
stock
is
undoubtedly
caused
by
the
magnitude
of
the
bank
capital
but
much
of
it
is
also
due
to
the
great
amount
of
unproductive
cash
of
cash
which
yields
no
interest
that
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
keeps
lying
idle
if
we
compare
the
london
and
westminster
bank
which
is
the
first
of
the
banks
in
the
public
estimation
and
known
to
be
very
cautiously
and
carefully
managed
with
the
bank
of
england
we
shall
see
the
difference
at
once
the
london
and
westminster
has
only
per
cent
of
its
liabilities
lying
idle
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
has
over
per
cent
so
great
a
difference
in
the
management
must
cause
and
does
cause
a
great
difference
in
the
profits
inevitably
the
shareholders
of
the
bank
of
england
will
dislike
this
great
difference
more
or
less
they
will
always
urge
their
directors
to
diminish
as
far
as
possible
the
unproductive
reserve
and
to
augment
as
far
as
possible
their
own
dividend
in
most
banks
there
would
be
a
wholesome
dread
restraining
the
desire
of
the
shareholders
to
reduce
the
reserve
they
would
fear
to
impair
the
credit
of
the
bank
but
fortunately
or
unfortunately
no
one
has
any
fear
about
the
bank
of
england
the
english
world
at
least
believes
that
it
will
not
almost
that
it
can
not
fail
three
times
since
the
banking
department
has
received
assistance
and
would
have
failed
without
it
in
the
entire
concern
almost
suspended
payment
in
it
actually
did
so
but
still
there
is
a
faith
in
the
bank
contrary
to
experience
and
despising
evidence
no
doubt
in
every
one
of
these
years
the
condition
of
the
bank
divided
or
undivided
was
in
a
certain
sense
most
sound
it
could
ultimately
have
paid
all
its
creditors
all
it
owed
and
returned
to
its
shareholders
all
their
own
capital
but
ultimate
payment
is
not
what
the
creditors
of
a
bank
want
they
want
present
not
postponed
payment
they
want
to
be
repaid
according
to
agreement
the
contract
was
that
they
should
be
paid
on
demand
and
if
they
are
not
paid
on
demand
they
may
be
ruined
and
that
instant
payment
in
the
years
i
speak
of
the
bank
of
england
certainly
could
not
have
made
but
no
one
in
london
ever
dreams
of
questioning
the
credit
of
the
bank
and
the
bank
never
dreams
that
its
own
credit
is
in
danger
somehow
everybody
feels
the
bank
is
sure
to
come
right
in
when
it
had
scarcely
any
money
left
the
government
said
not
only
that
it
need
not
pay
away
what
remained
but
that
it
must
not
the
of
letters
of
licence
to
break
peel
act
has
confirmed
the
popular
conviction
that
the
government
is
close
behind
the
bank
and
will
help
it
when
wanted
neither
the
bank
nor
the
banking
department
have
ever
had
an
idea
of
being
put
liquidation
most
men
would
think
as
soon
of
up
the
english
nation
since
then
the
bank
of
england
as
a
bank
is
exempted
from
the
perpetual
apprehension
that
makes
other
bankers
keep
a
large
reserve
the
apprehension
of
discredit
it
would
seem
particularly
necessary
that
its
managers
should
be
themselves
specially
interested
in
keeping
that
reserve
and
specially
competent
to
keep
it
but
i
need
not
say
that
the
bank
directors
have
not
their
personal
fortune
at
stake
in
the
management
of
the
bank
they
are
rich
city
merchants
and
their
stake
in
the
bank
is
trifling
in
comparison
with
the
rest
of
their
wealth
if
the
bank
were
wound
up
most
of
them
would
hardly
in
their
income
feel
the
difference
and
what
is
more
the
bank
directors
are
not
trained
bankers
they
were
not
bred
to
the
trade
and
do
not
in
general
give
the
main
power
of
their
minds
to
it
they
are
merchants
most
of
whose
time
and
most
of
whose
real
mind
are
occupied
in
making
money
in
their
own
business
and
for
themselves
it
might
be
expected
that
as
this
great
public
duty
was
cast
upon
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
the
principal
statesmen
if
not
parliament
itself
would
have
enjoined
on
them
to
perform
it
but
no
distinct
resolution
of
parliament
has
ever
enjoined
it
scarcely
any
stray
word
of
any
influential
statesman
and
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
whole
of
authorities
beginning
with
sir
robert
peel
and
ending
with
lowe
which
say
that
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
is
only
a
bank
like
any
other
bank
a
company
like
other
companies
that
in
this
capacity
it
has
no
peculiar
position
and
no
public
duties
at
all
of
english
statesmen
if
they
were
asked
as
to
the
management
of
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
would
reply
that
it
was
no
business
of
theirs
or
of
parliament
at
all
that
the
banking
department
alone
must
look
to
it
the
result
is
that
we
have
placed
the
exclusive
custody
of
our
entire
banking
reserve
in
the
hands
of
a
single
board
of
directors
not
particularly
trained
for
the
duty
who
might
be
called
who
have
no
particular
interest
above
other
people
in
keeping
it
undiminished
who
acknowledge
no
obligation
to
keep
it
undiminished
who
have
never
been
told
by
any
great
statesman
or
public
authority
that
they
are
so
to
keep
it
or
that
they
have
anything
to
do
with
it
who
are
named
by
and
are
agents
for
a
proprietary
which
would
have
a
greater
income
if
it
was
diminished
who
do
not
fear
and
who
need
not
fear
ruin
even
if
it
were
all
gone
and
wasted
that
such
an
arrangement
is
strange
must
be
plain
but
its
strangeness
can
only
be
comprehended
when
we
know
what
the
custody
of
a
national
banking
reserve
means
and
how
delicate
and
difficult
it
is
ii
such
a
reserve
as
we
have
seen
is
kept
to
meet
sudden
and
unexpected
demands
if
the
bankers
of
a
country
are
asked
for
much
more
than
is
commonly
wanted
then
this
reserve
must
be
resorted
to
what
then
are
these
extra
demands
and
how
is
this
extra
reserve
to
be
used
speaking
broadly
these
extra
demands
are
of
two
kinds
one
from
abroad
to
meet
foreign
payments
requisite
to
pay
large
and
unusual
foreign
debts
and
the
other
from
at
home
to
meet
sudden
apprehension
or
panic
arising
in
any
manner
rational
or
irrational
no
country
has
ever
been
so
exposed
as
england
to
a
foreign
demand
on
its
banking
reserve
not
only
because
at
present
england
is
a
large
borrower
from
foreign
nations
but
also
and
much
more
because
no
nation
has
ever
had
a
foreign
trade
of
such
magnitude
in
such
varied
objects
or
so
ramified
through
the
world
the
ordinary
foreign
trade
of
a
country
requires
no
cash
the
exports
on
one
side
balance
the
imports
on
the
other
but
a
sudden
trade
of
import
like
the
import
of
foreign
corn
after
a
bad
harvestor
what
is
much
less
common
though
there
are
cases
of
it
the
cessation
of
any
great
export
causes
a
balance
to
become
due
which
must
be
paid
in
cash
now
the
only
source
from
which
large
sums
of
cash
can
be
withdrawn
in
countries
where
banking
is
at
all
developed
is
a
reserve
in
england
especially
except
a
few
sums
of
no
very
considerable
amount
held
by
bullion
dealers
in
the
course
of
their
business
there
are
no
sums
worth
mentioning
in
cash
out
of
the
banks
an
ordinary
person
could
hardly
pay
a
serious
sum
without
going
to
some
bank
even
if
he
spent
a
month
in
trying
all
persons
who
wish
to
pay
a
large
sum
in
cash
trench
of
necessity
on
the
banking
reserve
but
then
what
is
within
a
country
the
action
of
a
government
can
settle
the
quantity
and
therefore
the
value
of
its
currency
but
outside
its
own
country
no
government
can
do
so
bullion
is
the
cash
of
international
trade
paper
currencies
are
of
no
use
there
and
coins
pass
only
as
they
contain
more
or
less
bullion
when
then
the
legal
tender
of
a
country
is
purely
metallic
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
banks
should
keep
a
sufficient
store
of
that
tender
but
when
the
tender
is
partly
metal
and
partly
paper
it
is
necessary
that
the
paper
tender
the
bank
note
should
be
convertible
into
bullion
and
here
i
should
pass
my
limits
and
enter
on
the
theory
of
peel
act
if
i
began
to
discuss
the
conditions
of
convertibility
i
deal
only
with
the
primary
of
effectual
foreign
payments
a
sufficient
supply
of
the
local
legal
tender
with
the
afterstep
the
change
of
the
local
legal
tender
into
the
universally
acceptable
commodity
can
not
deal
what
i
have
to
deal
with
is
for
the
present
ample
enough
the
bank
of
england
must
keep
a
reserve
of
tender
to
be
used
for
foreign
payments
if
itself
fit
and
to
be
used
in
obtaining
bullion
if
itself
unfit
and
foreign
payments
are
sometimes
very
large
and
often
very
sudden
the
drain
as
it
is
called
the
drain
to
the
east
to
pay
for
indian
cotton
during
the
american
civil
war
took
many
millions
from
this
country
for
a
series
of
years
a
bad
harvest
must
take
millions
in
a
single
year
in
order
to
find
such
great
sums
the
bank
of
england
requires
the
steady
use
of
an
effectual
instrument
that
instrument
is
the
elevation
of
the
rate
of
interest
if
the
interest
of
money
be
raised
it
is
proved
by
experience
that
money
does
come
to
lombard
street
and
theory
shows
that
it
ought
to
come
to
fully
explain
the
matter
i
must
go
deep
into
the
theory
of
the
exchanges
but
the
general
notion
is
plain
enough
loanable
capital
like
every
other
commodity
comes
where
there
is
most
to
be
made
of
it
continental
bankers
and
others
instantly
send
great
sums
here
as
soon
as
the
rate
of
interest
shows
that
it
can
be
done
profitably
while
english
credit
is
good
a
rise
of
the
value
of
money
in
lombard
street
immediately
by
a
banking
operation
brings
money
to
lombard
street
and
there
is
also
a
slower
mercantile
operation
the
rise
in
the
rate
of
discount
acts
immediately
on
the
trade
of
this
country
prices
fall
here
in
consequence
imports
are
diminished
exports
are
increased
and
therefore
there
is
more
likelihood
of
a
balance
in
bullion
coming
to
this
country
after
the
rise
in
the
rate
than
there
was
before
whatever
persons
one
bank
or
many
banks
in
any
country
hold
the
banking
reserve
of
that
country
ought
at
the
very
beginning
of
an
unfavourable
foreign
exchange
at
once
to
raise
the
rate
of
interest
so
as
to
prevent
their
reserve
from
being
diminished
farther
and
so
as
to
replenish
it
by
imports
of
bullion
this
duty
up
to
about
the
year
the
bank
of
england
did
not
perform
at
all
as
i
shall
show
farther
on
a
more
miserable
history
can
hardly
be
found
than
that
of
the
attempts
of
the
bank
if
indeed
they
can
be
called
attempts
to
keep
a
reserve
and
to
manage
a
foreign
drain
between
the
year
when
cash
payments
were
resumed
by
the
bank
and
when
our
modern
money
market
may
be
said
to
begin
and
the
year
the
panic
of
that
year
for
the
first
time
taught
the
bank
directors
wisdom
and
converted
them
to
sound
principles
the
present
policy
of
the
bank
is
an
infinite
improvement
on
the
policy
before
the
two
must
not
be
for
an
instant
confounded
but
nevertheless
as
i
shall
hereafter
show
the
present
policy
is
now
still
most
defective
and
much
discussion
and
much
effort
will
be
wanted
before
that
policy
becomes
what
it
ought
to
be
a
domestic
drain
is
very
different
such
a
drain
arises
from
a
disturbance
of
credit
within
the
country
and
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
it
is
the
greater
because
it
is
often
caused
or
at
least
often
enhanced
by
a
foreign
drain
times
without
number
the
public
have
been
alarmed
mainly
because
they
saw
that
the
banking
reserve
was
already
low
and
that
it
was
daily
getting
lower
the
two
maladies
an
external
drain
and
an
internal
often
attack
the
money
market
at
once
what
then
ought
to
be
done
in
opposition
to
what
might
be
at
first
sight
supposed
the
best
way
for
the
bank
or
banks
who
have
the
custody
of
the
bank
reserve
to
deal
with
a
drain
arising
from
internal
discredit
is
to
lend
freely
the
first
instinct
of
everyone
is
the
contrary
there
being
a
large
demand
on
a
fund
which
you
want
to
preserve
the
most
obvious
way
to
preserve
it
is
to
hoard
it
to
get
in
as
much
as
you
can
and
to
let
nothing
go
out
which
you
can
help
but
every
banker
knows
that
this
is
not
the
way
to
diminish
discredit
this
discredit
means
opinion
that
you
have
not
got
any
money
and
to
dissipate
that
opinion
you
must
if
possible
show
that
you
have
money
you
must
employ
it
for
the
public
benefit
in
order
that
the
public
may
know
that
you
have
it
the
time
for
economy
and
for
accumulation
is
before
a
good
banker
will
have
accumulated
in
ordinary
times
the
reserve
he
is
to
make
use
of
in
extraordinary
times
ordinarily
discredit
does
not
at
first
settle
on
any
particular
bank
still
less
does
it
at
first
concentrate
itself
on
the
bank
or
banks
holding
the
principal
cash
reserve
these
banks
are
almost
sure
to
be
those
in
best
credit
or
they
would
not
be
in
that
position
and
having
the
reserve
they
are
likely
to
look
stronger
and
seem
stronger
than
any
others
at
first
incipient
panic
amounts
to
a
kind
of
vague
conversation
is
a
as
good
as
he
used
to
be
has
not
lost
money
and
a
thousand
such
questions
a
hundred
people
are
talked
about
and
a
thousand
think
i
talked
about
or
am
i
not
my
credit
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
or
is
it
less
and
every
day
as
a
panic
grows
this
floating
suspicion
becomes
both
more
intense
and
more
diffused
it
attacks
more
persons
and
attacks
them
all
more
virulently
than
at
first
all
men
of
experience
therefore
try
to
strengthen
themselves
as
it
is
called
in
the
early
stage
of
a
panic
they
borrow
money
while
they
can
they
come
to
their
banker
and
offer
bills
for
discount
which
commonly
they
would
not
have
offered
for
days
or
weeks
to
come
and
if
the
merchant
be
a
regular
customer
a
banker
does
not
like
to
refuse
because
if
he
does
he
will
be
said
or
may
be
said
to
be
in
want
of
money
and
so
may
attract
the
panic
to
himself
not
only
merchants
but
all
persons
under
pecuniary
liabilities
present
or
imminent
feel
this
wish
to
themselves
and
in
proportion
to
those
liabilities
especially
is
this
the
case
with
what
may
be
called
the
auxiliary
dealers
in
credit
under
any
system
of
banking
there
will
always
group
themselves
about
the
main
bank
or
banks
in
which
is
kept
the
reserve
a
crowd
of
smaller
money
dealers
who
watch
the
minutae
of
bills
look
into
special
securities
which
busy
bankers
have
not
time
for
and
so
gain
a
livelihood
as
business
grows
the
number
of
such
subsidiary
persons
augments
the
various
modes
in
which
money
may
be
lent
have
each
their
peculiarities
and
persons
who
devote
themselves
to
one
only
lend
in
that
way
more
safely
and
therefore
more
cheaply
in
time
of
panic
these
subordinate
dealers
in
money
will
always
come
to
the
principal
dealers
in
ordinary
times
the
intercourse
between
the
two
is
probably
close
enough
the
little
dealer
is
probably
in
the
habit
of
pledging
his
to
the
larger
dealer
at
a
rate
less
than
he
has
himself
charged
and
of
running
into
the
market
to
lend
again
his
time
and
brains
are
his
principal
capital
and
he
wants
to
be
always
using
them
but
in
times
of
incipient
panic
the
minor
money
dealer
always
becomes
alarmed
his
credit
is
never
very
established
or
very
wide
he
always
fears
that
he
may
be
the
person
on
whom
current
suspicion
will
fasten
and
often
he
is
so
accordingly
he
asks
the
larger
dealer
for
advances
a
number
of
such
persons
ask
all
the
large
dealers
those
who
have
the
money
the
holders
of
the
reserve
and
then
the
plain
problem
before
the
great
dealers
comes
to
be
shall
we
best
protect
ourselves
no
doubt
the
immediate
advance
to
these
dealers
is
annoying
but
may
not
the
refusal
of
it
even
be
dangerous
a
panic
grows
by
what
it
feeds
on
if
it
devours
these
men
shall
we
the
first
class
be
safe
a
panic
in
a
word
is
a
species
of
neuralgia
and
according
to
the
rules
of
science
you
must
not
starve
it
the
holders
of
the
cash
reserve
must
be
ready
not
only
to
keep
it
for
their
own
liabilities
but
to
advance
it
most
freely
for
the
liabilities
of
others
they
must
lend
to
merchants
to
minor
bankers
to
man
and
that
man
whenever
the
security
is
good
in
wild
periods
of
alarm
one
failure
makes
many
and
the
best
way
to
prevent
the
derivative
failures
is
to
arrest
the
primary
failure
which
causes
them
the
way
in
which
the
panic
of
was
stopped
by
advancing
money
has
been
described
in
so
broad
and
graphic
a
way
that
the
passage
has
become
classical
lent
it
said
harman
on
behalf
of
the
bank
of
england
every
possible
means
and
in
modes
we
had
never
adopted
before
we
took
in
stock
on
security
we
purchased
exchequer
bills
we
made
advances
on
exchequer
bills
we
not
only
discounted
outright
but
we
made
advances
on
the
deposit
of
bills
of
exchange
to
an
immense
amount
in
short
by
every
possible
means
consistent
with
the
safety
of
the
bank
and
we
were
not
on
some
occasions
seeing
the
dreadful
state
in
which
the
public
were
we
rendered
every
assistance
in
our
power
after
a
day
or
two
of
this
treatment
the
entire
panic
subsided
and
the
was
quite
calm
the
problem
of
managing
a
panic
must
not
be
thought
of
as
mainly
a
problem
it
is
primarily
a
mercantile
one
all
merchants
are
under
liabilities
they
have
bills
to
meet
soon
and
they
can
only
pay
those
bills
by
discounting
bills
on
other
merchants
in
other
words
all
merchants
are
dependent
on
borrowing
money
and
large
merchants
are
dependent
on
borrowing
much
money
at
the
slightest
symptom
of
panic
many
merchants
want
to
borrow
more
than
usual
they
think
they
will
supply
themselves
with
the
means
of
meeting
their
bills
while
those
means
are
still
forthcoming
if
the
bankers
gratify
the
merchants
they
must
lend
largely
just
when
they
like
it
least
if
they
do
not
gratify
them
there
is
a
panic
on
the
surface
there
seems
a
great
inconsistency
in
all
this
first
you
establish
in
some
bank
or
banks
a
certain
reserve
you
make
of
it
or
them
a
kind
of
ultimate
treasury
where
the
last
shilling
of
the
country
is
deposited
and
kept
and
then
you
go
on
to
say
that
this
final
treasury
is
also
to
be
the
last
that
out
of
it
unbounded
or
at
any
rate
immense
advances
are
to
be
made
when
no
once
else
lends
this
seems
like
saying
first
that
the
reserve
should
be
kept
and
then
that
it
should
not
be
kept
but
there
is
no
puzzle
in
the
matter
the
ultimate
banking
reserve
of
a
country
by
whomsoever
kept
is
not
kept
out
of
show
but
for
certain
essential
purposes
and
one
of
those
purposes
is
the
meeting
a
demand
for
cash
caused
by
an
alarm
within
the
country
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
our
ultimate
treasure
in
particular
cases
should
be
lent
on
the
contrary
we
keep
that
treasure
for
the
very
reason
that
in
particular
cases
it
should
be
lent
when
reduced
to
abstract
principle
the
subject
comes
to
this
an
is
an
opinion
that
the
money
of
certain
persons
will
not
pay
their
creditors
when
those
creditors
want
to
be
paid
if
possible
that
alarm
is
best
met
by
enabling
those
persons
to
pay
their
creditors
to
the
very
moment
for
this
purpose
only
a
little
money
is
wanted
if
that
alarm
is
not
so
met
it
aggravates
into
a
panic
which
is
an
opinion
that
most
people
or
very
many
people
will
not
pay
their
creditors
and
this
too
can
only
be
met
by
enabling
all
those
persons
to
pay
what
they
owe
which
takes
a
great
deal
of
money
no
one
has
enough
money
or
anything
like
enough
but
the
holders
of
the
bank
reserve
not
that
the
help
so
given
by
the
banks
holding
that
reserve
necessarily
diminishes
it
very
commonly
the
panic
extends
as
far
or
almost
as
far
as
the
bank
or
banks
which
hold
the
reserve
but
does
not
touch
it
or
them
at
all
in
this
case
it
is
enough
if
the
dominant
bank
or
banks
so
to
speak
pledge
their
credit
for
those
who
want
it
under
our
present
system
it
is
often
quite
enough
that
a
merchant
or
a
banker
gets
the
advance
made
to
him
put
to
his
credit
in
the
books
of
the
bank
of
england
he
may
never
draw
a
cheque
on
it
or
if
he
does
that
cheque
may
come
in
again
to
the
credit
of
some
other
customer
who
lets
it
remain
on
his
account
an
increase
of
loans
at
such
times
is
often
an
increase
of
the
liabilities
of
the
bank
not
a
diminution
of
its
reserve
just
so
before
an
issue
of
notes
as
in
to
quell
a
panic
entirely
internal
did
not
diminish
the
bullion
reserve
the
notes
went
out
but
they
did
not
return
they
were
issued
as
loans
to
the
public
but
the
public
wanted
no
more
they
never
presented
them
for
payment
they
never
asked
that
sovereigns
should
be
given
for
them
but
the
acceptance
of
a
great
liability
during
an
augmenting
alarm
though
not
as
bad
as
an
equal
advance
of
cash
is
the
thing
next
worst
at
any
moment
the
cash
may
be
demanded
supposing
the
panic
to
grow
it
will
be
demanded
and
the
reserve
will
be
lessened
accordingly
no
doubt
all
precautions
may
in
the
end
be
unavailing
extraordinary
occasions
says
ricardo
general
panic
may
seize
the
country
when
every
one
becomes
desirous
of
possessing
himself
of
the
precious
metals
as
the
most
convenient
mode
of
realising
or
concealing
his
property
against
such
panic
banks
have
no
security
any
the
bank
or
banks
which
hold
the
reserve
may
last
a
little
longer
than
the
others
but
if
apprehension
pass
a
certain
bound
they
must
perish
too
the
use
of
credit
is
that
it
enables
debtors
to
use
a
certain
part
of
the
money
their
creditors
have
lent
them
if
all
those
creditors
demand
all
that
money
at
once
they
can
not
have
it
for
that
which
their
debtors
have
used
is
for
the
time
employed
and
not
to
be
obtained
with
the
advantages
of
credit
we
must
take
the
disadvantages
too
but
to
lessen
them
as
much
as
we
can
we
must
keep
a
great
store
of
ready
money
always
available
and
advance
out
of
it
very
freely
in
periods
of
panic
and
in
times
of
incipient
alarm
the
management
of
the
money
market
is
the
more
difficult
because
as
has
been
said
periods
of
internal
panic
and
external
demand
for
bullion
commonly
occur
together
the
foreign
drain
empties
the
bank
till
and
that
emptiness
and
the
resulting
rise
in
the
rate
of
discount
tend
to
frighten
the
market
the
holders
of
the
reserve
have
therefore
to
treat
two
opposite
maladies
at
once
one
requiring
stringent
remedies
and
especially
a
rapid
rise
in
the
rate
of
interest
and
the
other
an
alleviative
treatment
with
large
and
ready
loans
before
we
had
much
specific
experience
it
was
not
easy
to
prescribe
for
this
compound
disease
but
now
we
know
how
to
deal
with
it
we
must
look
first
to
the
foreign
drain
and
raise
the
rate
of
interest
as
high
as
may
be
necessary
unless
you
can
stop
the
foreign
export
you
can
not
allay
the
domestic
alarm
the
bank
will
get
poorer
and
poorer
and
its
poverty
will
protract
or
renew
the
apprehension
and
at
the
rate
of
interest
so
raised
the
holders
one
or
the
final
bank
reserve
must
lend
freely
very
large
loans
at
very
high
rates
are
the
best
remedy
for
the
worst
malady
of
the
money
market
when
a
foreign
drain
is
added
to
a
domestic
drain
any
notion
that
money
is
not
to
be
had
or
that
it
may
not
be
had
at
any
price
only
raises
alarm
to
panic
and
enhances
panic
to
madness
but
though
the
rule
is
clear
the
greatest
delicacy
the
finest
and
best
skilled
judgment
are
needed
to
deal
at
once
with
such
great
and
contrary
evils
and
great
as
is
the
delicacy
of
such
a
problem
in
all
countries
it
is
far
greater
in
england
now
than
it
was
or
is
elsewhere
the
strain
thrown
by
a
panic
on
the
final
bank
reserve
is
proportional
to
the
magnitude
of
a
country
commerce
and
to
the
number
and
size
of
the
dependent
banks
banks
that
is
holding
no
cash
reserve
that
are
grouped
around
the
central
bank
or
banks
and
in
both
respects
our
system
causes
a
stupendous
strain
the
magnitude
of
our
commerce
and
the
number
and
magnitude
of
the
banks
which
depend
on
the
bank
of
england
are
undeniable
there
are
very
many
more
persons
under
great
liabilities
than
there
are
or
ever
were
anywhere
else
at
the
commencement
of
every
panic
all
persons
under
such
liabilities
try
to
supply
themselves
with
the
means
of
meeting
those
liabilities
while
they
can
this
causes
a
great
demand
for
new
loans
and
so
far
from
being
able
to
meet
it
the
bankers
who
do
not
keep
an
extra
reserve
at
that
time
borrow
largely
or
do
not
renew
large
loans
very
likely
do
both
london
bankers
other
than
the
bank
of
england
effect
this
in
several
ways
first
they
have
probably
discounted
bills
to
a
large
amount
for
the
bill
brokers
and
if
these
bills
are
paid
they
decline
discounting
any
others
to
replace
them
the
directors
of
the
london
and
westminster
bank
had
in
the
panic
of
discounted
millions
of
such
bills
and
they
justly
said
that
if
those
bills
were
paid
they
would
have
an
amount
of
cash
far
more
than
sufficient
for
any
demand
but
how
were
those
bills
to
be
paid
some
one
else
must
lend
the
money
to
pay
them
the
mercantile
community
could
not
on
a
sudden
bear
to
lose
so
large
a
sum
of
borrowed
money
they
have
been
used
to
rely
on
it
and
they
could
not
carry
on
their
business
without
it
least
of
all
could
they
bear
it
at
the
beginning
of
a
panic
when
everybody
wants
more
money
than
usual
speaking
broadly
those
bills
can
only
be
paid
by
the
discount
of
other
bills
when
the
bills
suppose
of
a
manchester
warehouseman
which
he
gave
to
the
manufacturer
become
due
he
can
not
as
a
rule
pay
for
them
at
once
in
cash
he
has
bought
on
credit
and
he
has
sold
on
credit
he
is
but
a
middleman
to
pay
his
own
bill
to
the
maker
of
the
goods
he
must
discount
the
bills
he
has
received
from
the
shopkeepers
to
whom
he
has
sold
the
goods
but
if
there
is
a
sudden
cessation
in
the
means
of
discount
he
will
not
be
able
to
discount
them
all
our
mercantile
community
must
obtain
new
loans
to
pay
old
debts
if
some
one
else
did
not
pour
into
the
market
the
money
which
the
banks
like
the
london
and
westminster
bank
take
out
of
it
the
bills
held
by
the
london
and
westminster
bank
could
not
be
paid
who
then
is
to
pour
in
the
new
money
certainly
not
the
bill
brokers
they
have
been
used
to
with
such
banks
as
the
london
and
westminster
millions
of
bills
and
if
they
see
that
they
are
not
likely
to
be
able
to
those
bills
they
instantly
protect
themselves
and
do
not
discount
them
their
business
does
not
allow
them
to
keep
much
cash
unemployed
they
give
interest
for
all
the
money
deposited
with
them
an
interest
often
nearly
approaching
the
interest
they
can
charge
as
they
can
only
keep
a
small
reserve
a
panic
tells
on
them
more
quickly
than
on
anyone
else
they
stop
their
discounts
or
much
diminish
their
discounts
immediately
there
is
no
new
money
to
be
had
from
them
and
the
only
place
at
which
they
can
have
it
is
the
bank
of
england
there
is
even
a
simpler
case
the
banker
who
is
uncertain
of
his
credit
and
wants
to
increase
his
cash
may
have
money
on
deposit
at
the
bill
brokers
if
he
wants
to
replenish
his
reserve
he
may
ask
for
it
suppose
just
when
the
alarm
is
beginning
but
if
a
great
number
of
persons
do
this
very
suddenly
the
bill
brokers
will
not
at
once
be
able
to
pay
without
borrowing
they
have
excellent
bills
in
their
case
but
these
will
not
be
due
for
some
days
and
the
demand
from
the
more
or
less
alarmed
bankers
is
for
payment
at
once
and
accordingly
the
bill
broker
takes
refuge
at
the
bank
of
england
the
only
place
where
at
such
a
moment
new
money
is
to
be
had
the
case
is
just
the
same
if
the
banker
wants
to
sell
consols
or
to
call
in
money
lent
on
consols
these
he
reckons
as
part
of
his
reserve
and
in
ordinary
times
nothing
can
be
better
according
to
the
saying
you
sell
consols
on
a
sunday
in
a
time
of
no
alarm
or
in
any
alarm
affecting
that
particular
banker
only
he
can
rely
on
such
reserve
without
misgiving
but
not
so
in
a
general
panic
then
if
he
wants
to
sell
worth
of
consols
he
will
not
find
of
fresh
money
ready
to
come
into
the
market
all
ordinary
bankers
are
wanting
to
sell
or
thinking
they
may
have
to
sell
the
only
resource
is
the
bank
of
england
in
a
great
panic
consols
can
not
be
sold
unless
the
bank
of
england
will
advance
to
the
buyer
and
no
buyer
can
obtain
advances
on
consols
at
such
a
time
unless
the
bank
of
england
will
lend
to
him
the
case
is
worse
if
the
alarm
is
not
confined
to
the
great
towns
but
is
diffused
through
the
country
as
a
rule
country
bankers
only
keep
so
much
barren
cash
as
is
necessary
for
their
common
business
all
the
rest
they
leave
at
the
bill
brokers
or
at
the
banks
or
invest
in
consols
and
such
securities
but
in
a
panic
they
come
to
london
and
want
this
money
and
it
is
only
from
the
bank
of
england
that
they
can
get
it
for
all
the
rest
of
london
want
their
money
for
themselves
if
we
remember
that
the
liabilities
of
lombard
street
payable
on
demand
are
far
larger
than
those
of
any
like
market
and
that
the
liabilities
of
the
country
are
greater
still
we
can
conceive
the
magnitude
of
the
pressure
on
the
bank
of
england
when
both
lombard
street
and
the
country
suddenly
and
at
once
come
upon
it
for
aid
no
other
bank
was
ever
exposed
to
a
demand
so
formidable
for
none
ever
before
kept
the
banking
reserve
for
such
a
nation
as
the
english
the
mode
in
which
the
bank
of
england
meets
this
great
responsibility
is
very
curious
it
unquestionably
does
make
enormous
advances
in
every
panic
in
the
loans
on
increased
from
l
to
l
ditto
ditto
l
to
l
ditto
ditto
l
to
l
but
on
the
other
hand
as
we
have
seen
though
the
bank
more
or
less
does
its
duty
it
does
not
distinctly
acknowledge
that
it
is
its
duty
we
are
apt
to
be
solemnly
told
that
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
is
only
a
bank
like
other
banks
that
it
has
no
peculiar
duty
in
times
of
panic
that
it
then
is
to
look
to
itself
alone
as
other
banks
look
and
there
is
this
excuse
for
the
bank
hitherto
questions
of
banking
have
been
so
little
discussed
in
comparison
with
questions
of
currency
that
the
duty
of
the
bank
in
time
of
panic
has
been
put
on
a
wrong
ground
it
is
imagined
that
because
bank
notes
are
a
legal
tender
the
bank
has
some
peculiar
duty
to
help
other
people
but
bank
notes
are
only
a
legal
tender
at
the
issue
department
not
at
the
banking
department
and
the
accidental
combination
of
the
two
departments
in
the
same
building
gives
the
banking
department
no
aid
in
meeting
a
panic
if
the
issue
department
were
at
somerset
house
and
if
it
issued
government
notes
there
the
position
of
the
banking
department
under
the
present
law
would
be
exactly
what
it
is
now
no
doubt
formerly
the
bank
of
england
could
issue
what
it
pleased
but
that
historical
reminiscence
makes
it
no
stronger
now
that
it
can
no
longer
so
issue
we
must
deal
with
what
is
not
with
what
was
and
a
still
worse
argument
is
also
used
it
is
said
that
because
the
bank
of
england
keeps
the
account
and
is
the
government
banker
it
is
a
sort
of
institution
and
ought
to
help
everybody
but
the
custody
of
the
taxes
which
have
been
collected
and
which
wait
to
be
expended
is
a
duty
quite
apart
from
panics
the
government
money
may
chance
to
be
much
or
little
when
the
panic
comes
there
is
no
relation
or
connection
between
the
two
and
the
state
in
getting
the
bank
to
keep
what
money
it
may
chance
to
have
or
in
borrowing
of
it
what
money
it
may
chance
to
want
does
not
hire
it
to
stop
a
panic
or
much
help
it
if
it
tries
the
real
reason
has
not
been
distinctly
seen
as
has
been
already
said
but
on
account
of
its
importance
and
perhaps
its
novelty
it
is
worth
saying
again
whatever
bank
or
banks
keep
the
ultimate
banking
reserve
of
the
country
must
lend
that
reserve
most
freely
in
time
of
apprehension
for
that
is
one
of
the
characteristic
uses
of
the
bank
reserve
and
the
mode
in
which
it
attains
one
of
the
main
ends
for
which
it
is
kept
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
at
present
and
in
fact
the
bank
of
england
keeps
our
ultimate
bank
reserve
and
therefore
it
must
use
it
in
this
manner
and
though
the
bank
of
england
certainly
do
make
great
advances
in
time
of
panic
yet
as
they
do
not
do
so
on
any
distinct
principle
they
naturally
do
it
hesitatingly
reluctantly
and
with
misgiving
in
even
in
the
latest
panic
and
the
one
in
which
on
the
whole
the
bank
acted
the
best
there
was
nevertheless
an
instant
when
it
was
believed
the
bank
would
not
advance
on
consols
or
at
least
hesitated
to
advance
on
them
the
moment
this
was
reported
in
the
city
and
telegraphed
to
the
country
it
made
the
panic
indefinitely
worse
in
fact
to
make
large
advances
in
this
faltering
way
is
to
incur
the
evil
of
making
them
without
obtaining
the
advantage
what
is
wanted
and
what
is
necessary
to
stop
a
panic
is
to
diffuse
the
impression
that
though
money
may
be
dear
still
money
is
to
be
had
if
people
could
be
really
convinced
that
they
could
have
money
if
they
wait
a
day
or
two
and
that
utter
ruin
is
not
coming
most
likely
they
would
cease
to
run
in
such
a
mad
way
for
money
either
shut
the
bank
at
once
and
say
it
will
not
lend
more
than
it
commonly
lends
or
lend
freely
boldly
and
so
that
the
public
may
feel
you
mean
to
go
on
lending
to
lend
a
great
deal
and
yet
not
give
the
public
confidence
that
you
will
lend
sufficiently
and
effectually
is
the
worst
of
all
policies
but
it
is
the
policy
now
pursued
in
truth
the
bank
do
not
lend
from
the
motives
which
should
make
a
bank
lend
the
holders
of
the
bank
reserve
ought
to
lend
at
once
and
most
freely
in
an
incipient
panic
because
they
fear
destruction
in
the
panic
they
ought
not
to
do
it
to
serve
others
they
ought
to
do
it
to
serve
themselves
they
ought
to
know
that
this
bold
policy
is
the
only
safe
one
and
for
that
reason
they
ought
to
choose
it
but
the
bank
directors
are
not
afraid
even
at
the
last
moment
they
say
that
happens
to
the
community
they
can
preserve
themselves
both
in
and
i
believe
also
in
though
there
is
no
printed
evidence
of
it
the
bank
directors
contended
that
the
banking
department
was
quite
safe
though
its
reserve
was
nearly
all
gone
and
that
it
could
strengthen
itself
by
selling
securities
and
by
refusing
to
discount
but
this
is
a
complete
dream
the
bank
of
england
could
not
sell
for
in
an
extreme
panic
there
is
no
one
else
to
buy
securities
the
bank
can
not
stay
still
and
wait
till
its
bills
are
paid
and
so
fill
its
coffers
for
unless
it
discounts
equivalent
bills
the
bills
which
it
has
already
discounted
will
not
be
paid
the
reserve
in
the
ultimate
bank
or
banks
those
keeping
the
reserve
runs
low
it
can
not
be
augmented
by
the
same
means
that
other
and
dependent
banks
commonly
adopt
to
maintain
their
reserve
for
the
dependent
banks
trust
that
at
such
moments
the
ultimate
banks
will
be
discounting
more
than
usual
and
lending
more
than
usual
but
ultimate
banks
have
no
similar
to
rely
upon
i
shall
have
failed
in
my
purpose
if
i
have
not
proved
that
the
system
of
entrusting
all
our
reserve
to
a
single
board
like
that
of
the
bank
directors
is
very
anomalous
that
it
is
very
dangerous
that
its
bad
consequences
though
much
felt
have
not
been
fully
seen
that
they
have
been
obscured
by
traditional
arguments
and
hidden
in
the
dust
of
ancient
controversies
but
it
will
be
said
what
would
be
better
what
other
system
could
there
be
we
are
so
accustomed
to
a
system
of
banking
dependent
for
its
cardinal
function
on
a
single
bank
that
we
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
other
but
the
natural
system
that
which
would
have
sprung
up
if
government
had
let
banking
alone
is
that
of
many
banks
of
equal
or
not
altogether
unequal
size
in
all
other
trades
competition
brings
the
traders
to
a
rough
approximate
equality
in
cotton
spinning
no
single
firm
far
and
permanently
outstrips
the
others
there
is
no
tendency
to
a
monarchy
in
the
cotton
world
nor
where
banking
has
been
left
free
is
there
any
tendency
to
a
monarchy
in
banking
either
in
manchester
in
liverpool
and
all
through
england
we
have
a
great
number
of
banks
each
with
a
business
more
or
less
good
but
we
have
no
single
bank
with
any
sort
of
predominance
nor
is
there
any
such
bank
in
scotland
in
the
new
world
of
joint
stock
banks
outside
the
bank
of
england
we
see
much
the
same
phenomenon
one
or
more
get
for
a
time
a
better
business
than
the
others
but
no
single
bank
permanently
obtains
an
unquestioned
predominance
none
of
them
gets
so
much
before
the
others
that
the
others
voluntarily
place
their
reserves
in
its
keeping
a
republic
with
many
competitors
of
a
size
or
sizes
suitable
to
the
business
is
the
constitution
of
every
trade
if
left
to
itself
and
of
banking
as
much
as
any
other
a
monarchy
in
any
trade
is
a
sign
of
some
anomalous
advantage
and
of
some
intervention
from
without
i
shall
be
at
once
asked
do
you
propose
a
revolution
do
you
propose
to
abandon
the
system
and
create
anew
a
system
my
plain
answer
is
that
i
do
not
propose
it
i
know
it
would
be
childish
credit
in
business
is
like
loyalty
in
government
you
must
take
what
you
can
find
of
it
and
work
with
it
if
possible
a
theorist
may
easily
map
out
a
scheme
of
government
in
which
queen
victoria
could
be
dispensed
with
he
may
make
a
theory
that
since
we
admit
and
we
know
that
the
house
of
commons
is
the
real
sovereign
any
other
sovereign
is
superfluous
but
for
practical
purposes
it
is
not
even
worth
while
to
examine
these
arguments
queen
victoria
is
loyally
obeyed
without
doubt
and
without
reasoning
by
millions
of
human
beings
if
those
millions
began
to
argue
it
would
not
be
easy
to
persuade
them
to
obey
queen
victoria
or
anything
else
effectual
arguments
to
convince
the
people
who
need
convincing
are
wanting
just
so
an
immense
system
of
credit
founded
on
the
bank
of
england
as
its
pivot
and
its
basis
now
exists
the
english
people
and
foreigners
too
trust
it
implicitly
every
banker
knows
that
if
he
has
to
prove
that
he
is
worthy
of
credit
however
good
may
be
his
arguments
in
fact
his
credit
is
gone
but
what
we
have
requires
no
proof
the
whole
rests
on
an
instinctive
confidence
generated
by
use
and
years
nothing
would
persuade
the
english
people
to
abolish
the
bank
of
england
and
if
some
calamity
swept
it
away
generations
must
elapse
before
at
all
the
same
trust
would
be
placed
in
any
other
equivalent
a
system
if
some
miracle
should
put
it
down
in
lombard
street
would
seem
monstrous
there
nobody
would
understand
it
or
confide
in
it
credit
is
a
power
which
may
grow
but
can
not
be
constructed
those
who
live
under
a
great
and
firm
system
of
credit
must
consider
that
if
they
break
up
that
one
they
will
never
see
another
for
it
will
take
years
upon
years
to
make
a
successor
to
it
on
this
account
i
do
not
suggest
that
we
should
return
to
a
natural
or
system
of
banking
i
should
only
incur
useless
ridicule
if
i
did
suggest
it
nor
can
i
propose
that
we
should
adopt
the
simple
and
straightforward
expedient
by
which
the
french
have
extricated
themselves
from
the
same
difficulty
in
france
all
banking
rests
on
the
bank
of
france
even
more
than
in
england
all
rests
on
the
bank
of
england
the
bank
of
france
keeps
the
final
banking
reserve
and
it
keeps
the
currency
reserve
too
but
the
state
does
not
trust
such
a
function
to
a
board
of
merchants
named
by
shareholders
the
nation
itself
the
executive
government
names
the
governor
and
of
the
bank
of
france
these
officers
have
indeed
beside
them
a
council
of
or
directors
named
by
the
shareholders
but
they
need
not
attend
to
that
council
unless
they
think
fit
they
are
appointed
to
watch
over
the
national
interest
and
in
so
doing
they
may
disregard
the
murmurs
of
the
if
they
like
and
in
theory
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
this
plan
the
keeping
the
single
banking
reserve
being
a
national
function
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
argue
that
government
should
choose
the
functionaries
no
doubt
such
a
political
intervention
is
contrary
to
the
sound
economical
doctrine
that
is
a
trade
and
only
a
trade
but
government
forgot
that
doctrine
when
by
privileges
and
monopolies
it
made
a
single
bank
predominant
over
all
others
and
established
the
system
as
that
system
exists
a
logical
frenchman
consistently
enough
argues
that
the
state
should
watch
and
manage
it
but
no
such
plan
would
answer
in
england
we
have
not
been
trained
to
care
for
logical
sequence
in
our
institutions
or
rather
we
have
been
trained
not
to
care
for
it
and
the
practical
result
for
which
we
do
care
would
in
this
case
be
bad
the
governor
of
the
bank
would
be
a
high
parliamentary
official
perhaps
in
the
cabinet
and
would
change
as
chance
majorities
and
the
strength
of
parties
decide
a
trade
peculiarly
requiring
consistency
and
special
attainment
would
be
managed
by
a
shifting
and
untrained
ruler
in
fact
the
whole
plan
would
seem
to
an
englishman
of
business
palpably
absurd
he
would
not
consider
it
he
would
not
think
it
worth
considering
that
it
works
fairly
well
in
france
and
that
there
are
specious
arguments
of
theory
for
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
his
mind
all
such
changes
being
out
of
the
question
i
can
propose
only
three
remedies
first
there
should
be
a
clear
understanding
between
the
bank
and
the
public
that
since
the
bank
hold
out
ultimate
banking
reserve
they
will
recognise
and
act
on
the
obligations
which
this
implies
that
they
will
replenish
it
in
times
of
foreign
demand
as
fully
and
lend
it
in
times
of
internal
panic
as
freely
and
readily
as
plain
principles
of
banking
require
this
looks
very
different
from
the
french
plan
but
it
is
not
so
different
in
reality
in
england
we
can
often
effect
by
the
indirect
compulsion
of
opinion
what
other
countries
must
effect
by
the
direct
compulsion
of
government
we
can
do
so
in
this
case
the
bank
directors
now
fear
public
opinion
exceedingly
probably
no
kind
of
persons
are
so
sensitive
to
newspaper
criticism
and
this
is
very
natural
our
statesmen
it
is
true
are
much
more
blamed
but
they
have
generally
served
a
long
apprenticeship
to
sharp
criticism
if
they
still
care
for
it
and
some
do
after
years
of
experience
much
more
than
the
world
thinks
they
care
less
for
it
than
at
first
and
have
come
to
regard
it
as
an
unavoidable
and
incessant
irritant
of
which
they
shall
never
be
rid
but
a
bank
director
undergoes
no
similar
training
and
hardening
his
functions
at
the
bank
fill
a
very
small
part
of
his
time
all
the
rest
of
his
life
unless
he
be
in
parliament
is
spent
in
retired
and
mercantile
industry
he
is
not
subjected
to
keen
and
public
criticism
and
is
not
taught
to
bear
it
especially
when
once
in
his
life
he
becomes
by
rotation
governor
he
is
most
anxious
that
the
two
years
of
office
shall
off
well
he
is
apt
to
be
irritated
even
by
objections
to
principles
on
which
he
acts
and
can
not
bear
with
equanimity
censure
which
is
pointed
and
personal
at
present
i
am
not
sure
if
this
sensitiveness
is
beneficial
as
the
exact
position
of
the
bank
of
england
in
the
money
market
is
indistinctly
seen
there
is
no
standard
to
which
a
bank
governor
can
appeal
he
is
always
in
fear
that
may
be
said
but
not
quite
knowing
on
what
side
that
may
be
his
fear
is
but
an
indifferent
guide
to
him
but
if
the
cardinal
doctrine
were
accepted
if
it
were
acknowledged
that
the
bank
is
charged
with
the
custody
of
our
sole
banking
reserve
and
is
bound
to
deal
with
it
according
to
admitted
principles
then
a
governor
of
the
bank
could
look
to
those
principles
he
would
know
which
way
criticism
was
coming
if
he
was
guided
by
the
code
he
would
have
a
plain
defence
and
then
we
may
be
sure
that
old
men
of
business
would
not
deviate
from
the
code
at
present
the
board
of
directors
are
a
sort
of
for
the
nation
i
would
have
them
real
trustees
and
with
a
good
trust
deed
secondly
the
government
of
the
bank
should
be
improved
in
a
manner
to
be
explained
we
should
diminish
the
element
we
should
augment
the
trained
banking
element
and
we
should
ensure
more
constancy
in
the
administration
thirdly
as
these
two
suggestions
are
designed
to
make
the
bank
as
strong
as
possible
we
should
look
at
the
rest
of
our
banking
system
and
try
to
reduce
the
demands
on
the
bank
as
much
as
we
can
the
central
machinery
being
inevitably
frail
we
should
carefully
and
as
much
as
possible
diminish
the
strain
upon
it
but
to
explain
these
proposals
and
to
gain
a
full
understanding
of
many
arguments
that
have
been
used
we
must
look
more
in
detail
at
the
component
parts
of
lombard
street
and
at
the
curious
set
of
causes
which
have
made
it
assume
its
present
singular
structure
chapter
iii
how
lombard
street
came
to
exist
and
why
it
assumed
its
present
form
in
the
last
century
a
favourite
subject
of
literary
ingenuity
was
history
as
it
was
then
called
upon
grounds
of
probability
a
fictitious
sketch
was
made
of
the
possible
origin
of
things
existing
if
this
kind
of
speculation
were
now
applied
to
banking
the
natural
and
first
idea
would
be
that
large
systems
of
deposit
banking
grew
up
in
the
early
world
just
as
they
grow
up
now
in
any
large
english
colony
as
soon
as
any
such
community
becomes
rich
enough
to
have
much
money
and
compact
enough
to
be
able
to
lodge
its
money
in
single
banks
it
at
once
begins
so
to
do
english
colonists
do
not
like
the
risk
of
keeping
their
money
and
they
wish
to
make
an
interest
on
it
they
carry
from
home
the
idea
and
the
habit
of
banking
and
they
take
to
it
as
soon
as
they
can
in
their
new
world
conjectural
history
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
all
banking
began
thus
but
such
history
is
rarely
of
any
value
the
basis
of
it
is
false
it
assumes
that
what
works
most
easily
when
established
is
that
which
it
would
be
the
most
easy
to
establish
and
that
what
seems
simplest
when
familiar
would
be
most
easily
appreciated
by
the
mind
though
unfamiliar
but
exactly
the
contrary
is
true
many
things
which
seem
simple
and
which
work
well
when
firmly
established
are
very
hard
to
establish
among
new
people
and
not
very
easy
to
explain
to
them
deposit
banking
is
of
this
sort
its
essence
is
that
a
very
large
number
of
persons
agree
to
trust
a
very
few
persons
or
some
one
person
banking
would
not
be
a
profitable
trade
if
bankers
were
not
a
small
number
and
depositors
in
comparison
an
immense
number
but
to
get
a
great
number
of
persons
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
is
always
very
difficult
and
nothing
but
a
very
palpable
necessity
will
make
them
on
a
sudden
begin
to
do
it
and
there
is
no
such
palpable
necessity
in
banking
if
you
take
a
country
town
in
france
even
now
you
will
not
find
any
such
system
of
banking
as
ours
are
unknown
and
money
kept
on
running
account
by
bankers
is
rare
people
store
their
money
in
a
caisse
at
their
houses
steady
savings
which
are
waiting
for
investment
and
which
are
sure
not
to
be
soon
wanted
may
be
lodged
with
bankers
but
the
common
floating
cash
of
the
community
is
kept
by
the
community
themselves
at
home
they
prefer
to
keep
it
so
and
it
would
not
answer
a
banker
purpose
to
make
expensive
arrangements
for
keeping
it
otherwise
if
a
such
as
the
national
provincial
bank
opens
in
an
english
country
town
were
opened
in
a
corresponding
french
one
it
would
not
pay
its
expenses
you
could
not
get
any
sufficient
number
of
frenchmen
to
agree
to
put
their
money
there
and
so
it
is
in
all
countries
not
of
british
descent
though
in
various
degrees
deposit
banking
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
begin
because
people
do
not
like
to
let
their
money
out
of
their
sight
especially
do
not
like
to
let
it
out
of
sight
without
security
still
more
can
not
all
at
once
agree
on
any
single
person
to
whom
they
are
content
to
trust
it
unseen
and
unsecured
hypothetical
history
which
explains
the
past
by
what
is
simplest
and
commonest
in
the
present
is
in
banking
as
in
most
things
quite
untrue
the
real
history
is
very
different
new
wants
are
mostly
supplied
by
adaptation
not
by
creation
or
foundation
something
having
been
created
to
satisfy
an
extreme
want
it
is
used
to
satisfy
less
pressing
wants
or
to
supply
additional
conveniences
on
this
account
political
government
the
oldest
institution
in
the
world
has
been
the
hardest
worked
at
the
beginning
of
history
we
find
it
doing
everything
which
society
wants
done
and
forbidding
everything
which
society
does
not
wish
done
in
trade
at
present
the
first
commerce
in
a
new
place
is
a
general
shop
which
beginning
with
articles
of
real
necessity
comes
shortly
to
supply
the
oddest
accumulation
of
petty
comforts
and
the
history
of
banking
has
been
the
same
the
first
banks
were
not
founded
for
our
system
of
deposit
banking
or
for
anything
like
it
they
were
founded
for
much
more
pressing
reasons
and
having
been
founded
they
or
copies
from
them
were
applied
to
our
modern
uses
the
earliest
banks
of
italy
where
the
name
began
were
finance
companies
the
bank
of
george
at
genoa
and
other
banks
founded
in
imitation
of
it
were
at
first
only
companies
to
make
loans
to
and
float
loans
for
the
governments
of
the
cities
in
which
they
were
formed
the
want
of
money
is
an
urgent
want
of
governments
at
most
periods
and
seldom
more
urgent
than
it
was
in
the
tumultuous
italian
republics
of
the
middle
ages
after
these
banks
had
been
long
established
they
began
to
do
what
we
call
banking
business
but
at
first
they
never
thought
of
it
the
great
banks
of
the
north
of
europe
had
their
origin
in
a
want
still
more
curious
the
notion
of
its
being
a
prime
business
of
a
bank
to
give
good
coin
has
passed
out
of
men
memories
but
wherever
it
is
felt
there
is
no
want
of
business
more
keen
and
urgent
adam
smith
describes
it
so
admirably
that
it
would
be
stupid
not
to
quote
his
words
currency
of
a
great
state
such
as
france
or
england
generally
consists
almost
entirely
of
its
own
coin
should
this
currency
therefore
be
at
any
time
worn
clipt
or
otherwise
degraded
below
its
standard
value
the
state
by
a
reformation
of
its
coin
can
effectually
its
currency
but
the
currency
of
a
small
state
such
as
genoa
or
hamburgh
can
seldom
consist
altogether
in
its
own
coin
but
must
be
made
up
in
a
great
measure
of
the
coins
of
all
the
neighbouring
states
with
which
its
inhabitants
have
a
continual
intercourse
such
a
state
therefore
by
reforming
its
coin
will
not
always
be
able
to
reform
its
currency
if
foreign
bills
of
exchange
are
paid
in
this
currency
the
uncertain
value
of
any
sum
of
what
is
in
its
own
nature
so
uncertain
must
render
the
exchange
always
very
much
against
such
a
state
its
currency
being
in
all
foreign
states
necessarily
valued
even
below
what
it
is
worth
order
to
remedy
the
inconvenience
to
which
this
disadvantageous
exchange
must
have
subjected
their
merchants
such
small
states
when
they
began
to
attend
to
the
interest
of
trade
have
frequently
enacted
that
foreign
bills
of
exchange
of
a
certain
value
should
be
paid
not
in
common
currency
but
by
an
order
upon
or
by
a
transfer
in
the
books
of
a
certain
bank
established
upon
the
credit
and
under
the
protection
of
the
state
this
bank
being
always
obliged
to
pay
in
good
and
true
money
exactly
according
to
the
standard
of
the
state
the
banks
of
venice
genoa
amsterdam
hamburgh
and
nuremburg
seem
to
have
been
all
originally
established
with
this
view
though
some
of
them
may
have
afterwards
been
made
subservient
to
other
purposes
the
money
of
such
banks
being
better
than
the
common
currency
of
the
country
necessarily
bore
an
agio
which
was
greater
or
smaller
according
as
the
currency
was
supposed
to
be
more
or
less
degraded
below
the
standard
of
the
state
the
agio
of
the
bank
of
hamburgh
for
example
which
is
said
to
be
commonly
about
fourteen
per
cent
is
the
supposed
difference
between
the
good
standard
money
of
the
state
and
the
clipt
worn
and
diminished
currency
poured
into
it
from
all
the
neighbouring
states
the
great
quantity
of
clipt
and
worn
foreign
coin
which
the
extensive
trade
of
amsterdam
brought
from
all
parts
of
europe
reduced
the
value
of
its
currency
about
per
cent
below
that
of
good
money
fresh
from
the
mint
such
money
no
sooner
appeared
than
it
was
melted
down
or
carried
away
as
it
always
is
in
such
circumstances
the
merchants
with
plenty
of
currency
could
not
always
find
a
sufficient
quantity
of
good
money
to
pay
their
bills
of
exchange
and
the
value
of
those
bills
in
spite
of
several
regulations
which
were
made
to
prevent
it
became
in
a
great
measure
uncertain
order
to
remedy
these
inconveniences
a
bank
was
established
in
under
the
guarantee
of
the
city
this
bank
received
both
foreign
coin
and
the
light
and
worn
coin
of
the
country
at
its
real
intrinsic
value
in
the
good
standard
money
of
the
country
deducting
only
so
much
as
was
necessary
for
defraying
the
expense
of
coinage
and
the
other
necessary
expense
of
management
for
the
value
which
remained
after
this
small
deduction
was
made
it
gave
a
credit
in
its
books
this
credit
was
called
bank
money
which
as
it
represented
money
exactly
according
to
the
standard
of
the
mint
was
always
of
the
same
real
value
and
intrinsically
worth
more
than
current
money
it
was
at
the
same
time
enacted
that
all
bills
drawn
upon
or
negotiated
at
amsterdam
of
the
value
of
six
hundred
guilders
and
upwards
should
be
paid
in
bank
money
which
at
once
took
away
all
uncertainty
in
the
value
of
those
bills
every
merchant
in
consequence
of
this
regulation
was
obliged
to
keep
an
account
with
the
bank
in
order
to
pay
his
foreign
bills
of
exchange
which
necessarily
occasioned
a
certain
demand
for
bank
money
again
a
most
important
function
of
early
banks
is
one
which
the
present
banks
retain
though
it
is
subsidiary
to
their
main
use
viz
the
function
of
remitting
money
a
man
brings
money
to
the
bank
to
meet
a
payment
which
he
desires
to
make
at
a
great
distance
and
the
bank
having
a
connection
with
other
banks
sends
it
where
it
is
wanted
as
soon
as
bills
of
exchange
are
given
upon
a
large
scale
this
remittance
is
a
very
pressing
requirement
such
bills
must
be
made
payable
at
a
place
convenient
to
the
seller
of
the
goods
in
payment
of
which
they
are
given
perhaps
at
the
great
town
where
his
warehouse
is
but
this
may
be
very
far
from
the
retail
shop
of
the
buyer
who
bought
those
goods
to
sell
them
again
in
the
country
for
these
and
a
multitude
of
purposes
the
instant
and
regular
remittance
of
money
is
an
early
necessity
of
growing
trade
and
that
remittance
it
was
a
first
object
of
early
banks
to
accomplish
these
are
all
uses
other
than
those
of
deposit
banking
which
banks
supplied
that
afterwards
became
in
our
english
sense
deposit
banks
by
supplying
these
uses
they
gained
the
credit
that
afterwards
enabled
them
to
gain
a
living
as
deposit
banks
being
trusted
for
one
purpose
they
came
to
be
trusted
for
a
purpose
quite
different
ultimately
far
more
important
though
at
first
less
keenly
pressing
but
these
wants
only
affect
a
few
persons
and
therefore
bring
the
bank
under
the
notice
of
a
few
only
the
real
introductory
function
which
deposit
banks
at
first
perform
is
much
more
popular
and
it
is
only
when
they
can
perform
this
more
popular
kind
of
business
that
deposit
banking
ever
spreads
quickly
and
extensively
this
function
is
the
supply
of
the
paper
circulation
to
the
country
and
it
will
be
observed
that
i
am
not
about
to
overstep
my
limits
and
discuss
this
as
a
question
of
currency
in
what
form
the
best
paper
currency
can
be
supplied
to
a
country
is
a
question
of
economical
theory
with
which
i
do
not
meddle
here
i
am
only
narrating
unquestionable
history
not
dealing
with
an
argument
where
every
step
is
disputed
and
part
of
this
certain
history
is
that
the
best
way
to
diffuse
banking
in
a
community
is
to
allow
the
banker
to
issue
of
small
amount
that
can
supersede
the
metal
currency
this
amounts
to
a
subsidy
to
each
banker
to
enable
him
to
keep
open
a
bank
till
depositors
choose
to
come
to
it
the
country
where
deposit
banking
is
most
diffused
is
scotland
and
there
the
original
profits
were
entirely
derived
from
the
circulation
the
note
issue
is
now
a
most
trifling
part
of
the
liabilities
of
the
scotch
banks
but
it
was
once
their
mainstay
and
source
of
profit
a
curious
book
lately
published
has
enabled
us
to
follow
the
course
of
this
in
detail
the
bank
of
dundee
now
amalgamated
with
the
royal
bank
of
scotland
was
founded
in
and
had
become
before
its
amalgamation
eight
or
nine
years
since
a
bank
of
considerable
deposits
but
for
years
from
its
foundation
it
had
no
deposits
at
all
it
subsisted
mostly
on
its
note
issue
and
a
little
on
its
remittance
business
only
in
after
nearly
thirty
years
it
began
to
gain
deposits
but
from
that
time
they
augmented
very
rapidly
the
banking
history
of
england
has
been
the
same
though
we
have
no
country
bank
accounts
in
detail
which
go
back
so
far
but
probably
up
to
in
england
or
thereabouts
the
main
profit
of
banks
was
derived
from
the
circulation
and
for
many
years
after
that
the
deposits
were
treated
as
very
minor
matters
and
the
whole
of
banking
discussion
turned
on
questions
of
circulation
we
are
still
living
in
the
debris
of
that
controversy
for
as
i
have
so
often
said
people
can
hardly
think
of
the
structure
of
lombard
street
except
with
reference
to
the
paper
currency
and
to
the
act
of
which
regulates
it
now
the
french
are
still
in
the
same
epoch
of
the
subject
the
great
enquete
of
is
almost
wholly
taken
up
with
currency
matters
and
mere
banking
is
treated
as
subordinate
and
the
accounts
of
the
bank
of
france
show
why
the
last
weekly
statement
before
the
german
war
showed
that
the
circulation
of
the
bank
of
france
was
as
much
as
and
that
the
private
deposits
were
only
now
the
private
deposits
are
about
the
same
and
the
circulation
is
so
difficult
is
it
in
even
a
great
country
like
france
for
the
deposit
system
of
banking
to
take
root
and
establish
itself
with
the
strength
and
vigour
that
it
has
in
england
the
experience
of
germany
is
the
same
the
accounts
preceding
the
war
in
north
germany
showed
the
circulation
of
the
issuing
banks
to
be
and
the
deposits
to
be
while
the
corresponding
figures
at
the
present
moment
are
circulation
and
deposits
it
would
be
idle
to
multiply
instances
the
reason
why
the
use
of
bank
paper
commonly
precedes
the
habit
of
making
deposits
in
banks
is
very
plain
it
is
a
far
easier
habit
to
establish
in
the
issue
of
notes
the
banker
the
person
to
be
most
benefited
can
do
something
he
can
pay
away
his
own
in
loans
in
wages
or
in
payment
of
debts
but
in
the
getting
of
deposits
he
is
passive
his
issues
depend
on
himself
his
deposits
on
the
favour
of
others
and
to
the
public
the
change
is
far
easier
too
to
collect
a
great
mass
of
deposits
with
the
same
banker
a
great
number
of
persons
must
agree
to
do
something
but
to
establish
a
note
circulation
a
large
number
of
persons
need
only
do
nothing
they
receive
the
banker
notes
in
the
common
course
of
their
business
and
they
have
only
not
to
take
those
notes
to
the
banker
for
payment
if
the
public
refrain
from
taking
trouble
a
paper
circulation
is
immediately
in
existence
a
paper
circulation
is
begun
by
the
banker
and
requires
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
public
on
the
contrary
it
needs
an
effort
of
the
public
to
be
rid
of
notes
once
issued
but
deposit
banking
can
not
be
begun
by
the
banker
and
requires
a
spontaneous
and
consistent
effort
in
the
community
and
therefore
paper
issue
is
the
natural
prelude
to
deposit
banking
the
way
in
which
the
issue
of
notes
by
a
banker
prepares
the
way
for
the
deposit
of
money
with
him
is
very
plain
when
a
private
person
begins
to
possess
a
great
heap
of
it
will
soon
strike
him
that
he
is
trusting
the
banker
very
much
and
that
in
re
turn
he
is
getting
nothing
he
runs
the
risk
of
loss
and
robbery
just
as
if
he
were
hoarding
coin
he
would
run
no
more
risk
by
the
failure
of
the
bank
if
he
made
a
deposit
there
and
he
would
be
free
from
the
risk
of
keeping
the
cash
no
doubt
it
takes
time
before
even
this
simple
reasoning
is
understood
by
uneducated
minds
so
strong
is
the
wish
of
most
people
to
see
their
money
that
they
for
some
time
continue
to
hoard
for
a
long
period
a
few
do
so
but
in
the
end
common
sense
conquers
the
circulation
of
decreases
and
the
deposit
of
money
with
the
banker
increases
the
credit
of
the
banker
having
been
efficiently
advertised
by
the
note
and
accepted
by
the
public
he
lives
on
the
credit
so
gained
years
after
the
note
issue
itself
has
ceased
to
be
very
important
to
him
the
efficiency
of
this
introduction
is
proportional
to
the
diffusion
of
the
right
of
note
issue
a
single
monopolist
issuer
like
the
bank
of
france
works
its
way
with
difficulty
through
a
country
and
advertises
banking
very
slowly
even
now
the
bank
of
france
which
i
believe
by
law
ought
to
have
a
branch
in
each
department
has
only
branches
in
sixty
out
of
on
the
other
hand
the
swiss
banks
where
there
is
always
one
or
more
to
every
canton
diffuse
banking
rapidly
we
have
seen
that
the
liabilities
of
the
bank
of
france
stand
thus
notes
l
deposits
l
but
the
aggregate
swiss
banks
on
the
contrary
stand
notes
l
deposits
l
the
reason
is
that
a
central
bank
which
is
governed
in
the
capital
and
descends
on
a
country
district
has
much
fewer
modes
of
lending
money
safely
than
a
bank
of
which
the
partners
belong
to
that
district
and
know
the
men
and
things
in
it
a
note
issue
is
mainly
begun
by
loans
there
are
then
no
deposits
to
be
paid
but
the
mass
of
loans
in
a
rural
district
are
of
small
amount
the
bills
to
be
discounted
are
trifling
the
persons
borrowing
are
of
small
means
and
only
local
repute
the
value
of
any
property
they
wish
to
pledge
depends
on
local
changes
and
local
circumstances
a
banker
who
lives
in
the
district
who
has
always
lived
there
whose
whole
mind
is
a
history
of
the
district
and
its
changes
is
easily
able
to
lend
money
safely
there
but
a
manager
deputed
by
a
single
central
establishment
does
so
with
difficulty
the
worst
people
will
come
to
him
and
ask
for
loans
his
ignorance
is
a
mark
for
all
the
shrewd
and
crafty
people
thereabouts
he
will
have
endless
difficulties
in
establishing
the
circulation
of
the
distant
bank
because
he
has
not
the
local
knowledge
which
alone
can
teach
him
how
to
issue
that
circulation
with
safety
a
system
of
note
issues
is
therefore
the
best
introduction
to
a
large
system
of
deposit
banking
as
yet
historically
it
is
the
only
introduction
no
nation
as
yet
has
arrived
at
a
great
system
of
deposit
banking
without
going
first
through
the
preliminary
stage
of
note
issue
and
of
such
note
issues
the
quickest
and
most
efficient
in
this
way
is
one
made
by
individuals
resident
in
the
district
and
conversant
with
it
and
this
explains
why
deposit
banking
is
so
rare
such
a
note
issue
as
has
been
described
is
possible
only
in
a
country
exempt
from
invasion
and
free
from
revolution
during
an
invasion
banks
must
stop
payment
a
run
is
nearly
inevitable
at
such
a
time
and
in
a
revolution
too
in
such
great
and
close
civil
dangers
a
nation
is
always
demoralised
everyone
looks
to
himself
and
everyone
likes
to
possess
himself
of
the
precious
metals
these
are
sure
to
be
valuable
invasion
or
no
invasion
revolution
or
no
revolution
but
the
goodness
of
depends
on
the
solvency
of
the
banker
and
that
solvency
may
be
impaired
if
the
invasion
is
not
repelled
or
the
revolution
resisted
hardly
any
continental
country
has
been
till
now
exempt
for
long
periods
both
from
invasion
and
revolution
in
holland
and
germany
two
countries
where
note
issue
and
deposit
banking
would
seem
as
natural
as
in
england
and
scotland
there
was
never
any
security
from
foreign
war
a
profound
apprehension
of
external
invasion
penetrated
their
whole
habits
and
men
of
business
would
have
thought
it
insane
not
to
contemplate
a
contingency
so
frequent
in
their
history
and
perhaps
witnessed
by
themselves
france
indeed
before
was
an
exception
for
many
years
under
the
old
regime
she
was
exempt
from
serious
invasion
or
attempted
revolution
her
government
was
fixed
as
was
then
thought
and
powerful
it
could
resist
any
external
enemy
and
the
prestige
on
which
it
rested
seemed
too
firm
to
fear
any
enemy
from
within
but
then
it
was
not
an
honest
government
and
it
had
shown
its
dishonesty
in
this
particular
matter
of
note
issue
the
regent
in
law
time
had
given
a
monopoly
of
note
issue
to
a
bad
bank
and
had
paid
off
the
debts
of
the
nation
in
worthless
paper
the
government
had
created
a
machinery
of
ruin
and
had
thriven
on
it
among
so
apprehensive
a
race
as
the
french
the
result
was
fatal
for
many
years
no
attempt
at
note
issue
or
deposit
banking
was
possible
in
france
so
late
as
the
foundation
of
the
caisse
in
turgot
time
the
remembrance
of
law
failure
was
distinctly
felt
and
impeded
the
commencement
of
better
attempts
this
therefore
is
the
reason
why
lombard
street
exists
that
is
why
england
is
a
very
great
money
market
and
other
european
countries
but
small
ones
in
comparison
in
england
and
scotland
a
diffused
system
of
note
issues
started
banks
all
over
the
country
in
these
banks
the
savings
of
the
country
have
been
lodged
and
by
these
they
have
been
sent
to
london
no
similar
system
arose
elsewhere
and
in
consequence
london
is
full
of
money
and
all
continental
cities
are
empty
as
compared
with
it
ii
the
monarchical
form
of
lombard
street
is
due
also
to
the
note
issue
the
origin
of
the
bank
of
england
has
been
told
by
macaulay
and
it
is
never
wise
for
an
ordinary
writer
to
tell
again
what
he
has
told
so
much
better
nor
is
it
necessary
for
his
writings
are
in
everyone
hands
still
i
must
remind
my
readers
of
the
curious
story
of
all
institutions
in
the
world
the
bank
of
england
is
now
probably
the
most
remote
from
party
politics
and
from
but
in
its
origin
it
was
not
only
a
finance
company
but
a
whig
finance
company
it
was
founded
by
a
whig
government
because
it
was
in
desperate
want
of
money
and
supported
by
the
because
the
was
whig
very
briefly
the
story
was
this
the
government
of
charles
ii
under
the
cabal
ministry
had
brought
the
credit
of
the
english
state
to
the
lowest
possible
point
it
had
perpetrated
one
of
those
monstrous
frauds
which
are
likewise
gross
blunders
the
goldsmiths
who
then
carried
on
upon
a
trifling
scale
what
we
should
now
call
banking
used
to
deposit
their
reserve
of
treasure
in
the
with
the
sanction
and
under
the
care
of
the
government
in
many
european
countries
the
credit
of
the
state
had
been
so
much
better
than
any
other
credit
that
it
had
been
used
to
strengthen
the
beginnings
of
banking
the
credit
of
the
state
had
been
so
used
in
england
though
there
had
lately
been
a
civil
war
and
several
revolutions
the
honesty
of
the
english
government
was
trusted
implicitly
but
charles
ii
showed
that
it
was
trusted
undeservedly
he
shut
up
the
would
pay
no
one
and
so
the
were
ruined
the
credit
of
the
stuart
government
never
recovered
from
this
monstrous
robbery
and
the
government
created
by
the
revolution
of
could
hardly
expect
to
be
more
trusted
with
money
than
its
predecessor
a
government
created
by
a
revolution
hardly
ever
is
there
is
a
taint
of
violence
which
capitalists
dread
instinctively
and
there
is
always
a
rational
apprehension
that
the
government
which
one
revolution
thought
fit
to
set
up
another
revolution
may
think
fit
to
pull
down
in
the
credit
of
william
iii
government
was
so
low
in
london
that
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
borrow
any
large
sum
and
the
evil
was
the
greater
because
in
consequence
of
the
french
war
the
financial
straits
of
the
government
were
extreme
at
last
a
scheme
was
hit
upon
which
would
relieve
their
necessities
plan
says
macaulay
that
twelve
hundred
thousand
pounds
should
be
raised
at
what
was
then
considered
as
the
moderate
rate
of
per
cent
in
order
to
induce
the
subscribers
to
advance
the
money
promptly
on
terms
so
unfavourable
to
the
public
the
subscribers
were
to
be
incorporated
by
the
name
of
the
governor
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
they
were
so
incorporated
and
the
was
obtained
on
many
succeeding
occasions
their
credit
was
of
essential
use
to
the
government
without
their
aid
our
national
debt
could
not
have
been
borrowed
and
if
we
had
not
been
able
to
raise
that
money
we
should
have
been
conquered
by
france
and
compelled
to
take
back
james
ii
and
for
many
years
afterwards
the
existence
of
that
debt
was
a
main
reason
why
the
industrial
classes
never
would
think
of
recalling
the
pretender
or
of
upsetting
the
revolution
settlement
the
is
always
considered
in
the
books
of
that
time
as
opposed
to
his
sovereign
because
it
was
to
be
feared
that
this
sovereign
would
repudiate
the
debt
which
was
raised
by
those
who
dethroned
him
and
which
was
spent
in
resisting
him
and
his
allies
for
a
long
time
the
bank
of
england
was
the
focus
of
london
liberalism
and
in
that
capacity
rendered
to
the
state
inestimable
services
in
return
for
these
substantial
benefits
the
bank
of
england
received
from
the
government
either
at
first
or
afterwards
three
most
important
privileges
first
the
bank
of
england
had
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
government
balances
in
its
first
period
as
i
have
shown
the
bank
gave
credit
to
the
government
but
afterwards
it
derived
credit
from
the
government
there
is
a
natural
tendency
in
men
to
follow
the
example
of
the
government
under
which
they
live
the
government
is
the
largest
most
important
and
most
conspicuous
entity
with
which
the
mass
of
any
people
are
acquainted
its
range
of
knowledge
must
always
be
infinitely
greater
than
the
average
of
their
knowledge
and
therefore
unless
there
is
a
conspicuous
warning
to
the
contrary
most
men
are
inclined
to
think
their
government
right
and
when
they
can
to
do
what
it
does
especially
in
money
matters
a
man
might
fairly
reason
the
government
is
right
in
trusting
the
bank
of
england
with
the
great
balance
of
the
nation
i
can
not
be
wrong
in
trusting
it
with
my
little
balance
second
the
bank
of
england
had
till
lately
the
monopoly
of
limited
liability
in
england
the
common
law
of
england
knows
nothing
of
any
such
principle
it
is
only
possible
by
royal
charter
or
statute
law
and
by
neither
of
these
was
any
real
bank
i
do
not
count
absurd
schemes
such
as
chamberlayne
land
bank
permitted
with
limited
liability
in
england
till
within
these
few
years
indeed
a
good
many
people
thought
it
was
right
for
the
bank
of
england
but
not
right
for
any
other
bank
i
remember
hearing
the
conversation
of
a
distinguished
merchant
in
the
city
of
london
who
well
represented
the
ideas
then
most
current
he
was
declaiming
against
banks
of
limited
liability
and
some
one
asked
what
do
you
say
then
to
the
bank
of
england
where
you
keep
your
own
account
he
replied
is
an
exceptional
case
and
no
doubt
it
was
an
exception
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
bank
of
england
because
it
induced
many
quiet
and
careful
merchants
to
be
directors
of
the
bank
who
certainly
would
not
have
joined
any
bank
where
all
their
fortunes
were
liable
and
where
the
liability
was
not
limited
thirdly
the
bank
of
england
had
the
privilege
of
being
the
sole
joint
stock
company
permitted
to
issue
bank
notes
in
england
private
london
bankers
did
indeed
issue
notes
down
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
but
no
joint
stock
company
could
do
so
the
explanatory
clause
of
the
act
of
sounds
most
curiously
to
our
modern
ears
to
prevent
any
doubt
that
may
arise
concerning
the
privilege
or
power
given
to
the
said
governor
and
company
that
is
the
bank
of
england
of
exclusive
banking
and
also
in
regard
to
creating
any
other
bank
or
banks
by
parliament
or
restraining
other
persons
from
banking
during
the
continuance
of
the
said
privilege
granted
to
the
governor
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
as
before
recited
it
is
hereby
further
enacted
and
declared
by
the
authority
aforesaid
that
it
is
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
the
said
act
that
no
other
bank
shall
be
created
established
or
allowed
by
parliament
and
that
it
shall
not
be
lawful
for
any
body
politic
or
corporate
whatsoever
created
or
to
be
created
or
for
any
other
persons
whatsoever
united
or
to
be
united
in
covenants
or
partnership
exceeding
the
number
of
six
persons
in
that
part
of
great
britain
called
england
to
borrow
owe
or
take
up
any
sum
or
sums
of
money
on
their
bills
or
notes
payable
on
demand
or
at
any
less
time
than
six
months
from
the
borrowing
thereof
during
the
continuance
of
such
said
privilege
to
the
said
governor
and
company
who
are
hereby
declared
to
be
and
remain
a
corporation
with
the
privilege
of
exclusive
banking
as
before
recited
to
our
modern
ears
these
words
seem
to
mean
more
than
they
did
the
term
banking
was
then
applied
only
to
the
issue
of
notes
and
the
taking
up
of
money
on
bills
on
demand
our
present
system
of
deposit
banking
in
which
no
bills
or
promissory
notes
are
issued
was
not
then
known
on
a
great
scale
and
was
not
called
banking
but
its
effect
was
very
important
it
in
time
gave
the
bank
of
england
the
monopoly
of
the
note
issue
of
the
metropolis
it
had
at
that
time
no
branches
and
so
it
did
not
compete
for
the
country
circulation
but
in
the
metropolis
where
it
did
compete
it
was
completely
victorious
no
company
but
the
bank
of
england
could
issue
notes
and
unincorporated
individuals
gradually
gave
way
and
ceased
to
do
so
up
to
london
private
bankers
might
have
issued
notes
if
they
pleased
but
almost
a
hundred
years
ago
they
were
forced
out
of
the
field
the
bank
of
england
has
so
long
had
a
practical
monopoly
of
the
circulation
that
it
is
commonly
believed
always
to
have
had
a
legal
monopoly
and
the
practical
effect
of
the
clause
went
further
it
was
believed
to
make
the
bank
of
england
the
only
joint
stock
company
that
could
receive
deposits
as
well
as
the
only
company
that
could
issue
notes
the
gift
of
banking
to
the
bank
of
england
was
read
in
its
most
natural
modern
sense
it
was
thought
to
prohibit
any
other
banking
company
from
carrying
on
our
present
system
of
banking
after
joint
stock
banking
was
permitted
in
the
country
people
began
to
inquire
why
it
should
not
exist
in
the
metropolis
too
and
then
it
was
seen
that
the
words
i
have
quoted
only
forbid
the
issue
of
negotiable
instruments
and
not
the
receiving
of
money
when
no
such
instrument
is
given
upon
this
construction
the
london
and
westminster
bank
and
all
our
older
joint
stock
banks
were
founded
but
till
they
began
the
bank
of
england
had
among
companies
not
only
the
exclusive
privilege
of
note
issue
but
that
of
deposit
banking
too
it
was
in
every
sense
the
only
banking
company
in
london
with
so
many
advantages
over
all
competitors
it
is
quite
natural
that
the
bank
of
england
should
have
far
outstripped
them
all
inevitably
it
became
the
bank
in
london
all
the
other
bankers
grouped
themselves
round
it
and
lodged
their
reserve
with
it
thus
our
one
reserve
system
of
banking
was
not
deliberately
founded
upon
definite
reasons
it
was
the
gradual
consequence
of
many
singular
events
and
of
an
accumulation
of
legal
privileges
on
a
single
bank
which
has
now
been
altered
and
which
no
one
would
now
defend
chapter
iv
the
position
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
the
money
market
nothing
can
be
truer
in
theory
than
the
economical
principle
that
banking
is
a
trade
and
only
a
trade
and
nothing
can
be
more
surely
established
by
a
larger
experience
than
that
a
government
which
interferes
with
any
trade
injures
that
trade
the
best
thing
undeniably
that
a
government
can
do
with
the
money
market
is
to
let
it
take
care
of
itself
but
a
government
can
only
carry
out
this
principle
universally
if
it
observe
one
condition
it
must
keep
its
own
money
the
government
is
necessarily
at
times
possessed
of
large
sums
in
cash
it
is
by
far
the
richest
corporation
in
the
country
its
annual
revenue
payable
in
money
far
surpasses
that
of
any
other
body
or
person
and
if
it
begins
to
deposit
this
immense
income
as
it
accrues
at
any
bank
at
once
it
becomes
interested
in
the
welfare
of
that
bank
it
can
not
pay
the
interest
on
its
debt
if
that
bank
can
not
produce
the
public
deposits
when
that
interest
becomes
due
it
can
not
pay
its
salaries
and
defray
its
miscellaneous
expenses
if
that
bank
fail
at
any
time
a
modern
government
is
like
a
very
rich
man
with
very
great
debts
which
he
can
not
well
pay
its
credit
is
necessary
to
its
prosperity
almost
to
its
existence
and
if
its
banker
fail
when
one
of
its
debts
becomes
due
its
difficulty
is
intense
another
banker
it
will
be
said
may
take
up
the
government
account
he
may
advance
as
is
so
often
done
in
other
bank
failures
what
the
government
needs
for
the
moment
in
order
to
secure
the
government
account
in
future
but
the
imperfection
of
this
remedy
is
that
it
fails
in
the
very
worst
case
in
a
panic
and
at
a
general
collapse
of
credit
no
such
banker
will
probably
be
found
the
old
banker
who
possesses
the
government
deposit
can
not
repay
it
and
no
banker
not
having
that
deposit
will
at
a
bad
crisis
be
able
to
find
the
or
which
the
quarter
day
of
a
government
such
as
ours
requires
if
a
finance
minister
having
entrusted
his
money
to
a
bank
begins
to
act
strictly
and
say
he
will
in
all
cases
let
the
money
market
take
care
of
itself
the
reply
is
that
in
one
case
the
money
market
will
take
care
of
him
too
and
he
will
be
insolvent
in
the
infancy
of
banking
it
is
probably
much
better
that
a
government
should
as
a
rule
keep
its
own
money
if
there
are
not
banks
in
which
it
can
place
secure
reliance
it
should
not
seem
to
rely
upon
them
still
less
should
it
give
peculiar
favour
to
any
one
and
by
entrusting
it
with
the
government
account
secure
to
it
a
mischievous
supremacy
above
all
other
banks
the
skill
of
a
financier
in
such
an
age
is
to
equalise
the
receipt
of
taxation
and
the
outgoing
of
expenditure
it
should
be
a
principal
care
with
him
to
make
sure
that
more
should
not
be
locked
up
at
a
particular
moment
in
the
government
coffers
than
is
usually
locked
up
there
if
the
amount
of
dead
capital
so
buried
in
the
treasury
does
not
at
any
time
much
exceed
the
common
average
the
evil
so
caused
is
inconsiderable
it
is
only
the
loss
of
interest
on
a
certain
sum
of
money
which
would
not
be
much
of
a
burden
on
the
whole
nation
the
additional
taxation
it
would
cause
would
be
inconsiderable
such
an
evil
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
that
of
losing
the
money
necessary
for
inevitable
expence
by
entrusting
it
to
a
bad
bank
or
that
of
recovering
this
money
by
identifying
the
national
credit
with
the
bad
bank
and
so
propping
it
up
and
perpetuating
it
so
long
as
the
security
of
the
money
market
is
not
entirely
to
be
relied
on
the
government
of
a
country
had
much
better
leave
it
to
itself
and
keep
its
own
money
if
the
banks
are
bad
they
will
certainly
continue
bad
and
will
probably
become
worse
if
the
government
sustains
and
encourages
them
the
cardinal
maxim
is
that
any
aid
to
a
present
bad
bank
is
the
surest
mode
of
preventing
the
establishment
of
a
future
good
bank
when
the
trade
of
banking
began
to
be
better
understood
when
the
banking
system
was
thoroughly
secure
the
government
might
begin
to
lend
gradually
especially
to
lend
the
unusually
large
sums
which
even
under
the
most
equable
system
of
finance
will
at
times
accumulate
in
the
public
exchequer
under
a
natural
system
of
banking
it
would
have
every
facility
where
there
were
many
banks
keeping
their
own
reserve
and
each
most
anxious
to
keep
a
sufficient
reserve
because
its
own
life
and
credit
depended
on
it
the
risk
of
the
government
in
keeping
a
banker
would
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
it
would
have
the
choice
of
many
bankers
and
would
not
be
restricted
to
any
one
its
course
would
be
very
simple
and
be
analogous
to
that
of
other
public
bodies
in
the
country
the
metropolitan
board
of
works
which
collects
a
great
revenue
in
london
has
an
account
at
the
london
and
westminster
bank
for
which
that
bank
makes
a
deposit
of
consols
as
a
security
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
would
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
such
security
either
if
as
is
likely
his
account
would
be
thought
to
be
larger
than
any
single
bank
ought
to
be
entrusted
with
the
public
deposits
might
be
divided
between
several
each
would
give
security
and
the
whole
public
money
would
be
safe
if
at
any
time
the
floating
money
in
the
hands
of
government
were
exceptionally
large
he
might
require
augmented
security
to
be
lodged
and
he
might
obtain
an
interest
he
would
be
a
lender
of
such
magnitude
and
so
much
influence
that
he
might
command
his
own
terms
he
might
get
his
account
kept
safe
if
anyone
could
if
on
the
other
hand
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
were
a
borrower
as
at
times
he
is
he
would
have
every
facility
in
obtaining
what
he
wanted
the
credit
of
the
english
government
is
so
good
that
he
could
borrow
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
he
would
have
greater
facility
indeed
than
now
for
except
with
the
leave
of
parliament
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
can
not
borrow
by
our
present
laws
in
the
open
market
he
can
only
borrow
from
the
bank
of
england
on
what
are
called
bills
in
a
natural
system
he
would
borrow
of
any
one
out
of
many
competing
banks
selecting
the
one
that
would
lend
cheapest
but
under
our
present
artificial
system
he
is
confined
to
a
single
bank
which
can
fix
its
own
charge
if
contrary
to
expectation
a
collapse
occurred
the
government
might
withdraw
as
the
american
government
actually
has
withdrawn
its
balance
from
the
bankers
it
might
give
its
aid
lend
exchequer
bills
or
otherwise
pledge
its
credit
for
the
moment
but
when
the
exigency
was
passed
it
might
let
the
offending
banks
suffer
there
would
be
a
penalty
for
their
misconduct
new
and
better
banks
who
might
take
warning
from
that
misconduct
would
arise
as
in
all
natural
trades
what
is
old
and
rotten
would
perish
what
is
new
and
good
would
replace
it
and
till
the
new
banks
had
proved
by
good
conduct
their
fitness
for
state
confidence
the
state
need
not
give
it
the
government
could
use
its
favour
as
a
bounty
on
prudence
and
the
withdrawal
of
that
favour
as
a
punishment
for
culpable
folly
under
a
good
system
of
banking
a
great
collapse
except
from
rebellion
or
invasion
would
probably
not
happen
a
large
number
of
banks
each
feeling
that
their
credit
was
at
stake
in
keeping
a
good
reserve
probably
would
keep
one
if
any
one
did
not
it
would
be
criticised
constantly
and
would
soon
lose
its
standing
and
in
the
end
disappear
and
such
banks
would
meet
an
incipient
panic
freely
and
generously
they
would
advance
out
of
their
reserve
boldly
and
largely
for
each
individual
bank
would
fear
suspicion
and
know
that
at
such
periods
it
must
strength
if
at
such
times
it
wishes
to
be
thought
to
have
strength
such
a
system
reduces
to
a
minimum
the
risk
that
is
caused
by
the
deposit
if
the
national
money
can
safely
be
deposited
in
banks
in
any
way
this
is
the
way
to
make
it
safe
but
this
system
is
nearly
the
opposite
to
that
which
the
law
and
circumstances
have
created
for
us
in
england
the
english
government
far
from
keeping
cash
from
the
money
market
till
the
position
of
that
market
was
reasonably
secure
at
a
very
early
moment
and
while
credit
of
all
kinds
was
most
insecure
for
its
own
interests
entered
into
the
money
market
in
order
to
effect
loans
better
it
gave
the
custody
and
profit
of
its
own
money
along
with
other
privileges
to
a
single
bank
and
therefore
practically
and
in
fact
it
is
identified
with
the
bank
of
this
hour
it
can
not
let
the
money
market
take
care
of
itself
because
it
has
deposited
much
money
in
that
market
and
it
can
not
pay
its
way
if
it
loses
that
money
nor
would
any
english
statesman
propose
to
up
the
bank
of
england
a
theorist
might
put
such
a
suggestion
on
paper
but
no
responsible
government
would
think
of
it
at
the
worst
crisis
and
in
the
worst
misconduct
of
the
bank
no
such
plea
has
been
thought
of
in
when
its
till
was
empty
in
when
it
had
to
ask
aid
from
the
bank
of
france
no
such
idea
was
suggested
by
irresistible
tradition
the
english
government
was
obliged
to
deposit
its
money
in
the
money
market
and
to
deposit
with
this
particular
bank
and
this
system
has
plain
and
grave
evils
because
being
created
by
state
aid
it
is
more
likely
than
a
natural
system
to
require
state
help
because
being
a
system
it
reduces
the
spare
cash
of
the
money
market
to
a
smaller
amount
than
any
other
system
and
so
makes
that
market
more
delicate
there
being
a
less
hoard
to
meet
liabilities
any
error
in
the
management
of
that
reserve
has
a
proportionately
greater
effect
because
our
one
reserve
is
by
the
necessity
of
its
nature
given
over
to
one
board
of
directors
and
we
are
therefore
dependent
on
the
wisdom
of
that
one
only
and
can
not
as
in
most
trades
strike
an
average
of
the
wisdom
and
the
folly
the
discretion
and
the
indiscretion
of
many
competitors
lastly
because
that
board
of
directors
is
like
every
other
board
pressed
on
by
its
shareholders
to
make
a
high
dividend
and
therefore
to
keep
a
small
reserve
whereas
the
public
interest
imperatively
requires
that
they
shall
keep
a
large
one
these
four
evils
were
inseparable
from
the
system
but
there
is
besides
an
additional
and
accidental
evil
the
english
government
not
only
created
this
singular
system
but
it
proceeded
to
impair
it
and
demoralise
all
the
public
opinion
respecting
it
for
more
than
a
century
after
its
creation
notwithstanding
occasional
errors
the
bank
of
england
in
the
main
acted
with
judgment
and
with
caution
its
business
was
but
small
as
we
should
now
reckon
but
for
the
most
part
it
conducted
that
business
with
prudence
and
discretion
in
it
had
been
involved
in
the
most
serious
difficulties
and
had
been
obliged
to
refuse
to
pay
some
of
its
notes
for
a
long
period
it
was
in
wholesome
dread
of
public
opinion
and
the
necessity
of
retaining
public
confidence
made
it
cautious
but
the
english
government
removed
that
necessity
in
pitt
feared
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
obtain
sufficient
species
for
foreign
payments
in
consequence
of
the
low
state
of
the
bank
reserve
and
he
therefore
required
the
bank
not
to
pay
in
cash
he
removed
the
preservative
apprehension
which
is
the
best
security
of
all
banks
for
this
reason
the
period
under
which
the
bank
of
england
did
not
pay
gold
for
its
notes
the
period
from
to
is
always
called
the
period
of
the
bank
restriction
as
the
bank
during
that
period
did
not
perform
and
was
not
compelled
by
law
to
perform
its
contract
of
paying
its
notes
in
cash
it
might
apparently
have
been
well
called
the
period
of
bank
license
but
the
word
was
quite
right
and
was
the
only
proper
word
as
a
description
of
the
policy
of
pitt
did
not
say
that
the
bank
of
england
need
not
pay
its
notes
in
specie
he
them
from
doing
so
he
said
that
they
must
not
in
consequence
from
to
when
a
new
era
begins
there
never
was
a
proper
caution
on
the
part
of
the
bank
directors
at
heart
they
considered
that
the
bank
of
england
had
a
kind
of
charmed
life
and
that
it
was
above
the
ordinary
banking
anxiety
to
pay
its
way
and
this
feeling
was
very
natural
a
bank
of
issue
which
need
not
pay
its
notes
in
cash
has
a
charmed
life
it
can
lend
what
it
wishes
and
issue
what
it
likes
with
no
fear
of
harm
to
itself
and
with
no
substantial
check
but
its
own
inclination
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
bank
of
england
was
such
a
bank
for
all
that
time
it
could
not
be
in
any
danger
and
naturally
the
public
mind
was
demoralised
also
since
the
public
have
always
expected
the
government
to
help
the
bank
if
necessary
i
can
not
fully
discuss
the
suspensions
of
the
act
of
in
and
but
indisputably
one
of
their
effects
is
to
make
people
think
that
government
will
always
help
the
bank
if
the
bank
is
in
extremity
and
this
is
the
sort
of
anticipation
which
tends
to
justify
itself
and
to
cause
what
it
expects
on
the
whole
therefore
the
position
of
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
our
money
market
is
that
of
one
who
deposits
largely
in
it
who
created
it
and
who
demoralised
it
he
can
not
therefore
banish
it
from
his
thoughts
or
decline
responsibility
for
it
he
must
arrange
his
finances
so
as
not
to
intensify
panics
but
to
mitigate
them
he
must
aid
the
bank
of
england
in
the
discharge
of
its
duties
he
must
not
impede
or
prevent
it
his
aid
may
be
most
efficient
he
is
on
finance
the
natural
exponent
of
the
public
opinion
of
england
and
it
is
by
that
opinion
that
we
wish
the
bank
of
england
to
be
guided
under
a
natural
system
of
banking
we
should
have
relied
on
but
the
state
prevented
that
we
now
rely
on
opinion
instead
the
public
approval
is
a
reward
its
disapproval
a
severe
penalty
on
the
bank
directors
and
of
these
it
is
most
important
that
the
finance
minister
should
be
a
sound
and
felicitous
exponent
chapter
the
mode
in
which
the
value
of
money
is
settled
in
lombard
street
many
persons
believe
that
the
bank
of
england
has
some
peculiar
power
of
fixing
the
value
of
money
they
see
that
the
bank
of
england
varies
its
minimum
rate
of
discount
from
time
to
time
and
that
more
or
less
all
other
banks
follow
its
lead
and
charge
much
as
it
charges
and
they
are
puzzled
why
this
should
be
as
economists
teach
a
commodity
and
only
a
commodity
why
then
it
is
asked
is
its
value
fixed
in
so
odd
a
way
and
not
the
way
in
which
the
value
of
all
other
commodities
is
fixed
there
is
at
bottom
however
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
the
value
of
money
is
settled
like
that
of
all
other
commodities
by
supply
and
demand
and
only
the
form
is
essentially
different
in
other
commodities
all
the
large
dealers
fix
their
own
price
they
try
to
underbid
one
another
and
that
keeps
down
the
price
they
try
to
get
as
much
as
they
can
out
of
the
buyer
and
that
keeps
up
the
price
between
the
two
what
adam
smith
calls
the
higgling
of
the
market
settles
it
and
this
is
the
most
simple
and
natural
mode
of
doing
business
but
it
is
not
the
only
mode
if
circumstances
make
it
convenient
another
may
be
adopted
a
single
large
holder
especially
if
he
be
by
far
the
greatest
holder
may
fix
his
price
and
other
dealers
may
say
whether
or
not
they
will
undersell
him
or
whether
or
not
they
will
ask
more
than
he
does
a
very
considerable
holder
of
an
article
may
for
a
time
vitally
affect
its
value
if
he
lay
down
the
minimum
price
which
he
will
take
and
obstinately
adhere
to
it
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
value
of
money
in
lombard
street
is
settled
the
bank
of
england
used
to
be
a
predominant
and
is
still
a
most
important
dealer
in
money
it
lays
down
the
least
price
at
which
alone
it
will
dispose
of
its
stock
and
this
for
the
most
part
enables
other
dealers
to
obtain
that
price
or
something
near
it
the
reason
is
obvious
at
all
ordinary
moments
there
is
not
money
enough
in
lombard
street
to
discount
all
the
bills
in
lombard
street
without
taking
some
money
from
the
bank
of
england
as
soon
as
the
bank
rate
is
fixed
a
great
many
persons
who
have
bills
to
discount
try
how
much
cheaper
than
the
bank
they
can
get
these
bills
discounted
but
they
seldom
can
get
them
discounted
very
much
cheaper
for
if
they
did
everyone
would
leave
the
bank
and
the
outer
market
would
have
more
bills
than
it
could
bear
in
practice
when
the
bank
finds
this
process
beginning
and
sees
that
its
business
is
much
diminishing
it
lowers
the
rate
so
as
to
secure
a
reasonable
portion
of
the
business
to
itself
and
to
keep
a
fair
part
of
its
deposits
employed
at
dutch
auctions
an
upset
or
maximum
price
used
to
be
fixed
by
the
seller
and
he
came
down
in
his
bidding
till
he
found
a
buyer
the
value
of
money
is
fixed
in
lombard
street
in
much
the
same
way
only
that
the
upset
price
is
not
that
of
all
sellers
but
that
of
one
very
important
seller
some
part
of
whose
supply
is
essential
the
notion
that
the
bank
of
england
has
a
control
over
the
money
market
and
can
fix
the
rate
of
discount
as
it
likes
has
survived
from
the
old
days
before
when
the
bank
could
issue
as
many
notes
as
it
liked
but
even
then
the
notion
was
a
mistake
a
bank
with
a
monopoly
of
note
issue
has
great
sudden
power
in
the
money
market
but
no
permanent
power
it
can
affect
the
rate
of
discount
at
any
particular
moment
but
it
can
not
affect
the
average
rate
and
the
reason
is
that
any
momentary
fall
in
money
caused
by
the
caprice
of
such
a
bank
of
itself
tends
to
create
an
immediate
and
equal
rise
so
that
upon
an
average
the
value
is
not
altered
what
happens
is
this
if
a
bank
with
a
monopoly
of
note
issue
suddenly
lends
suppose
more
than
usual
it
causes
a
proportionate
increase
of
trade
and
increase
of
prices
the
persons
to
whom
that
was
lent
did
not
borrow
it
to
lock
it
up
they
borrow
it
in
the
language
of
the
market
to
with
that
is
they
try
to
buy
with
it
and
that
new
attempt
to
buy
that
new
demand
raises
prices
and
this
rise
of
prices
has
three
consequences
first
it
makes
everybody
else
want
to
borrow
money
money
is
not
so
efficient
in
buying
as
it
was
and
therefore
operators
require
more
money
for
the
same
dealings
if
railway
stock
is
per
cent
dearer
this
year
than
last
a
speculator
who
borrows
money
to
enable
him
to
deal
must
borrow
per
cent
more
this
year
than
last
and
in
consequence
there
is
an
augmented
demand
for
loans
secondly
this
is
an
effectual
demand
for
the
increased
price
of
railway
stock
enables
those
who
wish
it
to
borrow
more
upon
it
the
common
practice
is
to
lend
a
certain
portion
of
the
market
value
of
such
securities
and
if
that
value
increases
the
amount
of
the
usual
loan
to
be
obtained
on
them
increases
too
in
this
way
therefore
any
artificial
reduction
in
the
value
of
money
causes
a
new
augmentation
of
the
demand
for
money
and
thus
restores
that
value
to
its
natural
level
in
all
business
this
is
well
known
by
experience
a
stimulated
market
soon
becomes
a
tight
market
for
so
sanguine
are
enterprising
men
that
as
soon
as
they
get
any
unusual
ease
they
always
fancy
that
the
relaxation
is
greater
than
it
is
and
speculate
till
they
want
more
than
they
can
obtain
in
these
two
ways
sudden
loans
by
an
issuer
of
notes
though
they
may
temporarily
lower
the
value
of
money
do
not
lower
it
permanently
because
they
generate
their
own
counteraction
and
this
they
do
whether
the
notes
issued
are
convertible
into
coin
or
not
during
the
period
of
bank
restriction
from
to
the
bank
of
england
could
not
absolutely
control
the
money
market
any
more
than
it
could
after
when
it
was
compelled
to
pay
its
notes
in
coin
but
in
the
case
of
convertible
notes
there
is
a
third
effect
which
works
in
the
same
direction
and
works
more
quickly
a
rise
of
prices
confined
to
one
country
tends
to
increase
imports
because
other
countries
can
obtain
more
for
their
goods
if
they
send
them
there
and
it
discourages
exports
because
a
merchant
who
would
have
gained
a
profit
before
the
rise
by
buying
here
to
sell
again
will
not
gain
so
much
if
any
profit
after
that
rise
by
this
augmentation
of
imports
the
indebtedness
of
this
country
is
augmented
and
by
this
diminution
of
exports
the
proportion
of
that
indebtedness
which
is
paid
in
the
usual
way
is
decreased
also
in
consequence
there
is
a
larger
balance
to
be
paid
in
bullion
the
store
in
the
bank
or
banks
keeping
the
reserve
is
diminished
and
the
rate
of
interest
must
be
raised
by
them
to
stay
the
efflux
and
the
tightness
so
produced
is
often
greater
than
and
always
equal
to
the
preceding
unnatural
laxity
there
is
therefore
no
ground
for
believing
as
is
so
common
that
the
value
of
money
is
settled
by
different
causes
than
those
which
affect
the
value
of
other
commodities
or
that
the
bank
of
england
has
any
despotism
in
that
matter
it
has
the
power
of
a
large
holder
of
money
and
no
more
even
formerly
when
its
monetary
powers
were
greater
and
its
rivals
weaker
it
had
no
absolute
control
it
was
simply
a
large
corporate
dealer
making
bids
and
much
influencing
though
in
no
sense
compelling
other
dealers
thereby
but
though
the
value
of
money
is
not
settled
in
an
exceptional
way
there
is
nevertheless
a
peculiarity
about
it
as
there
is
about
many
articles
it
is
a
commodity
subject
to
great
fluctuations
of
value
and
those
fluctuations
are
easily
produced
by
a
slight
excess
or
a
slight
deficiency
of
quantity
up
to
a
certain
point
money
is
a
necessity
if
a
merchant
has
acceptances
to
meet
money
he
must
and
will
find
at
some
price
or
other
and
it
is
this
urgent
need
of
the
whole
body
of
merchants
which
runs
up
the
value
of
money
so
wildly
and
to
such
a
height
in
a
great
panic
on
the
other
hand
money
easily
becomes
a
as
the
phrase
is
and
there
is
soon
too
much
of
it
the
number
of
accepted
securities
is
limited
and
can
not
be
rapidly
increased
if
the
amount
of
money
seeking
these
accepted
securities
is
more
than
can
be
lent
on
them
the
value
of
money
soon
goes
down
you
may
often
hear
in
the
market
that
bills
are
not
to
be
had
meaning
good
bills
of
course
and
when
you
hear
this
you
may
be
sure
that
the
value
of
money
is
very
low
if
money
were
all
held
by
the
owners
of
it
or
by
banks
which
did
not
pay
an
interest
for
it
the
value
of
money
might
not
fall
so
fast
money
would
in
the
market
phrase
be
held
the
possessors
would
be
under
no
necessity
to
employ
it
all
they
might
employ
part
at
a
high
rate
rather
than
all
at
a
low
rate
but
in
lombard
street
money
is
very
largely
held
by
those
who
do
pay
an
interest
for
it
and
such
persons
must
employ
it
all
or
almost
all
for
they
have
much
to
pay
out
with
one
hand
and
unless
they
receive
much
with
the
other
they
will
be
ruined
such
persons
do
not
so
much
care
what
is
the
rate
of
interest
at
which
they
employ
their
money
they
can
reduce
the
interest
they
pay
in
proportion
to
that
which
they
can
make
the
vital
points
to
them
is
to
employ
it
at
some
rate
if
you
hold
as
in
lombard
street
some
persons
do
millions
of
other
people
money
at
interest
arithmetic
teaches
that
you
will
soon
be
ruined
if
you
make
nothing
of
it
even
if
the
interest
you
pay
is
not
high
the
fluctuations
in
the
value
of
money
are
therefore
greater
than
those
on
the
value
of
most
other
commodities
at
times
there
is
an
excessive
pressure
to
borrow
it
and
at
times
an
excessive
pressure
to
lend
it
and
so
the
price
is
forced
up
and
down
these
considerations
enable
us
to
estimate
the
responsibility
which
is
thrown
on
the
bank
of
england
by
our
system
and
by
every
system
on
the
bank
or
banks
who
by
it
keep
the
reserve
of
bullion
or
of
legal
tender
exchangeable
for
bullion
these
banks
can
in
no
degree
control
the
permanent
value
of
money
but
they
can
completely
control
its
momentary
value
they
can
not
change
the
average
value
but
they
can
determine
the
deviations
from
the
average
if
the
dominant
banks
manage
ill
the
rate
of
interest
will
at
one
time
be
excessively
high
and
at
another
time
excessively
low
there
will
be
first
a
pernicious
excitement
and
next
a
fatal
collapse
but
if
they
manage
well
the
rate
of
interest
will
not
deviate
so
much
from
the
average
rate
it
will
neither
ascend
so
high
nor
descend
so
low
as
far
as
anything
can
be
steady
the
value
of
money
will
then
be
steady
and
probably
in
consequence
trade
will
be
steady
too
at
least
a
principal
cause
of
periodical
disturbance
will
have
been
withdrawn
from
it
chapter
vi
why
lombard
street
is
often
very
dull
and
sometimes
extremely
excited
any
sudden
event
which
creates
a
great
demand
for
actual
cash
may
cause
and
will
tend
to
cause
a
panic
in
a
country
where
cash
is
much
economised
and
where
debts
payable
on
demand
are
large
in
such
a
country
an
immense
credit
rests
on
a
small
cash
reserve
and
an
unexpected
and
large
diminution
of
that
reserve
may
easily
break
up
and
shatter
very
much
if
not
the
whole
of
that
credit
such
accidental
events
are
of
the
most
various
nature
a
bad
harvest
an
apprehension
of
foreign
invasion
the
sudden
failure
of
a
great
firm
which
everybody
trusted
and
many
other
similar
events
have
all
caused
a
sudden
demand
for
cash
and
some
writers
have
endeavoured
to
classify
panics
according
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
accidents
producing
them
but
little
however
is
i
believe
to
be
gained
by
such
classifications
there
is
little
difference
in
the
effect
of
one
accident
and
another
upon
our
credit
system
we
must
be
prepared
for
all
of
them
and
we
must
prepare
for
all
of
them
in
the
same
way
by
keeping
a
large
cash
reserve
but
it
is
of
great
importance
to
point
out
that
our
industrial
organisation
is
liable
not
only
to
irregular
external
accidents
but
likewise
to
regular
internal
changes
that
these
changes
make
our
credit
system
much
more
delicate
at
some
times
than
at
others
and
that
it
is
the
recurrence
of
these
periodical
seasons
of
delicacy
which
has
given
rise
to
the
notion
that
panics
come
according
to
a
fixed
rule
that
every
ten
years
or
so
we
must
have
one
of
them
most
persons
who
begin
to
think
of
the
subject
are
puzzled
on
the
threshold
they
hear
much
of
times
and
times
meaning
by
times
in
which
nearly
everyone
is
very
well
off
and
by
times
in
which
nearly
everyone
is
comparatively
ill
off
and
at
first
it
is
natural
to
ask
why
should
everybody
or
almost
everybody
be
well
off
together
why
should
there
be
any
great
tides
of
industry
with
large
diffused
profit
by
way
of
flow
and
large
diffused
want
of
profit
or
loss
by
way
of
ebb
the
main
answer
is
hardly
given
distinctly
in
our
common
books
of
political
economy
these
books
do
not
tell
you
what
is
the
fund
out
of
which
large
general
profits
are
paid
in
good
times
nor
do
they
ex
plain
why
that
fund
is
not
available
for
the
same
purpose
in
bad
times
our
current
political
economy
does
not
sufficiently
take
account
of
time
as
an
element
in
trade
operations
but
as
soon
as
the
division
of
labour
has
once
established
itself
in
a
community
two
principles
at
once
begin
to
be
important
of
which
time
is
the
very
essence
these
are
first
that
as
goods
are
produced
to
be
exchanged
it
is
good
that
they
should
be
exchanged
as
quickly
as
possible
secondly
that
as
every
producer
is
mainly
occupied
in
producing
what
others
want
and
not
what
he
wants
himself
it
is
desirable
that
he
should
always
be
able
to
find
without
effort
without
delay
and
without
uncertainty
others
who
want
what
he
can
produce
in
themselves
these
principles
are
everyone
will
admit
it
to
be
expedient
that
all
goods
wanting
to
be
sold
should
be
sold
as
soon
as
they
are
ready
that
every
man
who
wants
to
work
should
find
employment
as
soon
as
he
is
ready
for
it
obviously
also
as
soon
as
the
of
labour
is
really
established
there
is
a
difficulty
about
both
of
these
principles
a
produces
what
he
thinks
b
wants
but
it
may
be
a
mistake
and
b
may
not
want
it
a
may
be
able
and
willing
to
produce
what
b
wants
but
he
may
not
be
able
to
find
b
he
may
not
know
of
his
existence
the
general
truth
of
these
principles
is
obvious
but
what
is
not
obvious
is
the
extreme
greatness
of
their
effects
taken
together
they
make
the
whole
difference
between
times
of
brisk
trade
and
great
prosperity
and
times
of
stagnant
trade
and
great
adversity
so
far
as
that
prosperity
and
that
adversity
are
real
and
not
illusory
if
they
are
satisfied
everyone
knows
whom
to
work
for
and
what
to
make
and
he
can
get
immediately
in
exchange
what
he
wants
himself
there
is
no
idle
labour
and
no
sluggish
capital
in
the
whole
community
and
in
consequence
all
which
can
be
produced
is
produced
the
effectiveness
of
human
industry
is
augmented
and
both
kinds
of
producers
both
capitalists
and
labourers
are
much
richer
than
usual
because
the
amount
to
be
divided
between
them
is
also
much
greater
than
usual
and
there
is
a
partnership
in
industries
no
single
large
industry
can
be
depressed
without
injury
to
other
industries
still
less
can
any
great
group
of
industries
each
industry
when
prosperous
buys
and
consumes
the
produce
probably
of
most
certainly
of
very
many
other
industries
and
if
industry
a
fail
and
is
in
difficulty
industries
b
and
c
and
d
which
used
to
sell
to
it
will
not
be
able
to
sell
that
which
they
had
produced
in
reliance
on
a
demand
and
in
future
they
will
stand
idle
till
industry
a
recovers
because
in
default
of
a
there
will
be
no
one
to
buy
the
commodities
which
they
create
then
as
industry
b
buys
of
c
d
the
adversity
of
b
tells
on
c
d
and
as
these
buy
of
e
f
the
effect
is
propagated
through
the
whole
alphabet
and
in
a
certain
sense
it
rebounds
z
feels
the
want
caused
by
the
diminished
custom
of
a
b
c
and
so
it
does
not
earn
so
much
in
consequence
it
can
not
lay
out
as
much
on
the
produce
of
a
b
c
and
so
these
do
not
earn
as
much
either
in
all
this
money
is
but
an
instrument
the
same
thing
would
happen
equally
well
in
a
trade
of
barter
if
a
state
of
barter
on
a
very
large
scale
were
not
practically
impossible
on
account
of
the
time
and
trouble
which
it
would
necessarily
require
as
has
been
explained
the
fundamental
cause
is
that
under
a
system
in
which
everyone
is
dependent
on
the
labour
of
everyone
else
the
loss
of
one
spreads
and
multiplies
through
all
and
spreads
and
multiplies
the
faster
the
higher
the
previous
perfection
of
the
system
of
divided
labour
and
the
more
nice
and
effectual
the
mode
of
interchange
and
the
entire
effect
of
a
depression
in
any
single
large
trade
requires
a
considerable
time
before
it
can
be
produced
it
has
to
be
propagated
and
to
be
returned
through
a
variety
of
industries
before
it
is
complete
short
depressions
in
consequence
have
scarcely
any
discernible
consequences
they
are
over
before
we
think
of
their
effects
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
continuous
and
considerable
depressions
that
the
cause
is
in
action
long
enough
to
produce
discernible
effects
the
most
common
and
by
far
the
most
important
case
where
the
depression
in
one
trade
causes
depression
in
all
others
is
that
of
depressed
agriculture
when
the
agriculture
of
the
world
is
ill
off
food
is
dear
and
as
the
amount
of
absolute
necessaries
which
a
people
consumes
can
not
be
much
diminished
the
additional
amount
which
has
to
be
spent
on
them
is
so
much
subtracted
from
what
used
to
be
spent
on
other
things
all
the
industries
a
b
c
d
up
to
z
are
somewhat
affected
by
an
augmentation
in
the
price
of
corn
and
the
most
affected
are
the
large
ones
which
produce
the
objects
in
ordinary
times
most
consumed
by
the
working
classes
the
clothing
trades
feel
the
difference
at
once
and
in
this
country
the
liquor
trade
a
great
source
of
english
revenue
feels
it
almost
equally
soon
especially
when
for
two
or
three
years
harvests
have
been
bad
and
corn
has
long
been
dear
every
industry
is
impoverished
and
almost
every
one
by
becoming
poorer
makes
every
other
poorer
too
all
trades
are
slack
from
diminished
custom
and
the
consequence
is
a
vast
stagnant
capital
much
idle
labour
and
a
greatly
retarded
production
it
takes
two
or
three
years
to
produce
this
full
calamity
and
the
recovery
from
it
takes
two
or
three
years
also
if
corn
should
long
be
cheap
the
labouring
classes
have
much
to
spend
on
what
they
like
besides
the
producers
of
those
things
become
prosperous
and
have
a
greater
purchasing
power
they
exercise
it
and
that
creates
in
the
class
they
deal
with
another
purchasing
power
and
so
all
through
society
the
whole
machine
of
industry
is
stimulated
to
its
maximum
of
energy
just
as
before
much
of
it
was
slackened
almost
to
its
minimum
a
great
calamity
to
any
great
industry
will
tend
to
produce
the
same
effect
but
the
fortunes
of
the
industries
on
which
the
wages
of
labour
are
expended
are
much
more
important
than
those
of
all
others
because
they
act
much
more
quickly
upon
a
larger
mass
of
purchasers
on
principle
if
there
was
a
perfect
division
of
labour
every
industry
would
have
to
be
perfectly
prosperous
in
order
that
any
one
might
be
so
so
far
therefore
from
its
being
at
all
natural
that
trade
should
develop
constantly
steadily
and
equably
it
is
plain
without
going
farther
from
theory
as
well
as
from
experience
that
there
are
inevitably
periods
of
rapid
dilatation
and
as
inevitably
periods
of
contraction
and
of
stagnation
nor
is
this
the
only
changeable
element
in
modern
industrial
societies
credit
the
disposition
of
one
man
to
trust
another
is
singularly
varying
in
england
after
a
great
calamity
everybody
is
suspicious
of
everybody
as
soon
as
that
calamity
is
forgotten
everybody
again
confides
in
everybody
on
the
continent
there
has
been
a
stiff
controversy
as
to
whether
credit
should
or
should
not
be
called
capital
in
england
even
the
little
attention
once
paid
to
abstract
economics
is
now
diverted
and
no
one
cares
in
the
least
for
refined
questions
of
this
kind
the
material
practical
point
is
that
in
chevalier
language
credit
is
or
additional
that
is
in
times
when
credit
is
good
productive
power
is
more
efficient
and
in
times
when
credit
is
bad
productive
power
is
less
efficient
and
the
state
of
credit
is
thus
influential
because
of
the
two
principles
which
have
just
been
explained
in
a
good
state
of
credit
goods
lie
on
hand
a
much
less
time
than
when
credit
is
bad
sales
are
quicker
intermediate
dealers
borrow
easily
to
augment
their
trade
and
so
more
and
more
goods
are
more
quickly
and
more
easily
transmitted
from
the
producer
to
the
consumer
these
two
variable
causes
are
causes
of
real
prosperity
they
augment
trade
and
production
and
so
are
plainly
beneficial
except
where
by
mistake
the
wrong
things
are
produced
or
where
also
by
mistake
misplaced
credit
is
given
and
a
man
who
can
not
produce
anything
which
is
wanted
gets
the
produce
of
other
people
labour
upon
a
false
idea
that
he
will
produce
it
but
there
is
another
variable
cause
which
produces
far
more
of
apparent
than
of
real
prosperity
and
of
which
the
effect
is
in
actual
life
mostly
confused
with
those
of
the
others
in
our
common
speculations
we
do
not
enough
remember
that
interest
on
money
is
a
refined
idea
and
not
a
universal
one
so
far
indeed
is
it
from
being
universal
that
the
majority
of
saving
persons
in
most
countries
would
reject
it
most
savings
in
most
countries
are
held
in
hoarded
specie
in
asia
in
africa
in
south
america
largely
even
in
europe
they
are
thus
held
and
it
would
frighten
most
of
the
owners
to
let
them
out
of
their
keeping
an
englishman
a
modern
englishman
at
least
assumes
as
a
first
principle
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
his
money
into
something
safe
that
will
yield
per
cent
but
most
saving
persons
in
most
countries
are
afraid
to
their
money
into
anything
nothing
is
safe
to
their
minds
indeed
in
most
countries
owing
to
a
bad
government
and
a
backward
industry
no
investment
or
hardly
any
really
is
safe
in
most
countries
most
men
are
content
to
forego
interest
but
in
more
advanced
countries
at
some
times
there
are
more
savings
seeking
investment
than
there
are
known
investments
for
at
other
times
there
is
no
such
superabundance
lord
macaulay
has
graphically
described
one
of
the
periods
of
excess
he
says
the
interval
between
the
restoration
and
the
revolution
the
riches
of
the
nation
had
been
rapidly
increasing
thousands
of
busy
men
found
every
christmas
that
after
the
expenses
of
the
year
housekeeping
had
been
defrayed
out
of
the
year
income
a
surplus
remained
and
how
that
surplus
was
to
be
employed
was
a
question
of
some
difficulty
in
our
time
to
invest
such
a
surplus
at
something
more
than
three
per
cent
on
the
best
security
that
has
ever
been
known
in
the
world
is
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
but
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
lawyer
a
physician
a
retired
merchant
who
had
saved
some
thousands
and
who
wished
to
place
them
safely
and
profitably
was
often
greatly
embarrassed
three
generations
earlier
a
man
who
had
accumulated
wealth
in
a
profession
generally
purchased
real
property
or
lent
his
savings
on
mortgage
but
the
number
of
acres
in
the
kingdom
had
remained
the
same
and
the
value
of
those
acres
though
it
had
greatly
increased
had
by
no
means
increased
so
fast
as
the
quantity
of
capital
which
was
seeking
for
employment
many
too
wished
to
put
their
money
where
they
could
find
it
at
an
notice
and
looked
about
for
some
species
of
property
which
could
be
more
readily
transferred
than
a
house
or
a
field
a
capitalist
might
lend
on
bottomry
or
on
personal
security
but
if
he
did
so
he
ran
a
great
risk
of
losing
interest
and
principal
there
were
a
few
joint
stock
companies
among
which
the
east
india
company
held
the
foremost
place
but
the
demand
for
the
stock
of
such
companies
was
far
greater
than
the
supply
indeed
the
cry
for
a
new
east
india
company
was
chiefly
raised
by
persons
who
had
found
difficulty
in
placing
their
savings
at
interest
on
good
security
so
great
was
that
difficulty
that
the
practice
of
hoarding
was
common
we
are
told
that
the
father
of
pope
the
poet
who
retired
from
business
in
the
city
about
the
time
of
the
revolution
carried
to
a
retreat
in
the
country
a
strong
box
containing
near
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
took
out
from
time
to
time
what
was
required
for
household
expenses
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
this
was
not
a
solitary
case
at
present
the
quantity
of
coin
which
is
hoarded
by
private
persons
is
so
small
that
it
would
if
brought
forth
make
no
perceptible
addition
to
the
circulation
but
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
reign
of
william
the
third
all
the
greatest
writers
on
currency
were
of
opinion
that
a
very
considerable
mass
of
gold
and
silver
was
hidden
in
secret
drawers
and
behind
wainscots
natural
effect
of
this
state
of
things
was
that
a
crowd
of
projectors
ingenious
and
absurd
honest
and
knavish
employed
themselves
in
devising
new
schemes
for
the
employment
of
redundant
capital
it
was
about
the
year
that
the
word
stockjobber
was
first
heard
in
london
in
the
short
space
of
four
years
a
crowd
of
companies
every
one
of
which
confidently
held
out
to
subscribers
the
hope
of
immense
gains
sprang
into
existence
the
insurance
company
the
paper
company
the
lutestring
company
the
pearl
fishery
company
the
glass
bottle
company
the
alum
company
the
blythe
coal
company
the
swordblade
company
there
was
a
tapestry
company
which
would
soon
furnish
pretty
hangings
for
all
the
parlours
of
the
middle
class
and
for
all
the
of
the
higher
there
was
a
copper
company
which
proposed
to
explore
the
mines
of
england
and
held
out
a
hope
that
they
would
prove
not
less
valuable
than
those
of
potosi
there
was
a
diving
company
which
undertook
to
bring
up
precious
effects
from
shipwrecked
vessels
and
which
announced
that
it
had
laid
in
a
stock
of
wonderful
machines
resembling
complete
suits
of
armour
in
front
of
the
helmet
was
a
huge
glass
eye
like
that
of
a
cyclops
and
out
of
the
crest
went
a
pipe
through
which
the
air
was
to
be
admitted
the
whole
process
was
exhibited
on
the
thames
fine
gentlemen
and
fine
ladies
were
invited
to
the
show
were
hospitably
regaled
and
were
delighted
by
seeing
the
divers
in
their
panoply
descend
into
the
river
and
return
laden
with
old
iron
and
ship
tackle
there
was
a
greenland
fishing
company
which
could
not
fail
to
drive
the
dutch
whalers
and
herring
busses
out
of
the
northern
ocean
there
was
a
tanning
company
which
promised
to
furnish
leather
superior
to
the
best
that
was
brought
from
turkey
or
russia
there
was
a
society
which
undertook
the
office
of
giving
gentlemen
a
liberal
education
on
low
terms
and
which
assumed
the
sounding
name
of
the
royal
academies
company
in
a
pompous
advertisement
it
was
announced
that
the
directors
of
the
royal
academies
company
had
engaged
the
best
masters
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
and
were
about
to
issue
twenty
thousand
tickets
at
twenty
shillings
each
there
was
to
be
a
lottery
two
thousand
prizes
were
to
be
drawn
and
the
fortunate
holders
of
the
prizes
were
to
be
taught
at
the
charge
of
the
company
latin
greek
hebrew
french
spanish
conic
sections
trigonometry
heraldry
japaning
fortification
bookkeeping
and
the
art
of
playing
the
theorbo
the
panic
was
forgotten
till
lord
macaulay
revived
the
memory
of
it
but
in
fact
in
the
south
sea
bubble
which
has
always
been
remembered
the
form
was
the
same
only
a
little
more
extravagant
the
companies
in
that
mania
were
for
objects
such
as
these
wrecks
to
be
fished
for
on
the
irish
coast
insurance
of
horses
and
other
cattle
two
millions
insurance
of
losses
by
servants
to
make
salt
water
fresh
for
building
of
hospitals
for
bastard
children
for
building
of
ships
against
pirates
for
making
of
oil
from
seeds
for
improving
of
malt
liquors
for
recovery
of
seamen
wages
for
extracting
of
silver
from
lead
for
the
transmuting
of
quicksilver
into
a
malleable
and
fine
metal
for
making
of
iron
with
for
importing
a
number
of
large
jack
asses
from
spain
for
trading
in
human
hair
for
fatting
of
hogs
for
a
wheel
of
perpetual
motion
but
the
most
strange
of
all
perhaps
was
for
an
undertaking
which
shall
in
due
time
be
revealed
each
subscriber
was
to
pay
down
two
guineas
and
hereafter
to
receive
a
share
of
one
hundred
with
a
disclosure
of
the
object
and
so
tempting
was
the
offer
that
of
these
subscriptions
were
paid
the
same
morning
with
which
the
projector
went
off
in
the
afternoon
in
there
were
speculations
in
companies
nearly
as
wild
and
just
before
there
were
some
of
a
like
nature
though
not
equally
extravagant
the
fact
is
that
the
owners
of
savings
not
finding
in
adequate
quantities
their
usual
kind
of
investments
rush
into
anything
that
promises
speciously
and
when
they
find
that
these
specious
investments
can
be
disposed
of
at
a
high
profit
they
rush
into
them
more
and
more
the
first
taste
is
for
high
interest
but
that
taste
soon
becomes
secondary
there
is
a
second
appetite
for
large
gains
to
be
made
by
selling
the
principal
which
is
to
yield
the
interest
so
long
as
such
sales
can
be
effected
the
mania
continues
when
it
ceases
to
be
possible
to
effect
them
ruin
begins
so
long
as
the
savings
remain
in
possession
of
their
owners
these
hazardous
gamblings
in
speculative
undertakings
are
almost
the
whole
effect
of
an
excess
of
accumulation
over
tested
investment
little
effect
is
produced
on
the
general
trade
of
the
country
the
owners
of
the
savings
are
too
scattered
and
far
from
the
market
to
change
the
majority
of
mercantile
transactions
but
when
these
savings
come
to
be
lodged
in
the
hands
of
bankers
a
much
wider
result
is
produced
bankers
are
close
to
mercantile
life
they
are
always
ready
to
lend
on
good
mercantile
securities
they
wish
to
lend
on
such
securities
a
large
part
of
the
money
entrusted
to
them
when
therefore
the
money
so
entrusted
is
unusually
large
and
when
it
long
continues
so
the
general
trade
of
the
country
is
in
the
course
of
time
changed
bankers
are
daily
more
and
more
ready
to
lend
money
to
mercantile
men
more
is
lent
to
such
men
more
bargains
are
made
in
consequence
commodities
are
more
sought
after
and
in
consequence
prices
rise
more
and
more
the
rise
of
prices
is
quickest
in
an
improving
state
of
credit
prices
in
general
are
mostly
determined
by
wholesale
transactions
the
retail
dealer
adds
a
percentage
to
the
wholesale
prices
not
of
course
always
the
same
percentage
but
still
mostly
the
same
given
the
wholesale
price
of
most
articles
you
can
commonly
tell
their
retail
price
now
wholesale
transactions
are
commonly
not
cash
transactions
but
bill
transactions
the
duration
of
the
bill
varies
with
the
custom
of
the
trade
it
may
be
two
three
months
or
six
weeks
but
there
is
always
a
bill
times
of
credit
mean
times
in
which
the
bills
of
many
people
are
taken
readily
times
of
bad
credit
times
when
the
bills
of
much
fewer
people
are
taken
and
even
of
those
suspiciously
in
times
of
good
credit
there
are
a
great
number
of
strong
purchasers
and
in
times
of
bad
credit
only
a
smaller
number
of
weak
ones
and
therefore
years
of
improving
credit
if
there
be
no
disturbing
cause
are
years
of
rising
price
and
years
of
decaying
credit
years
of
falling
price
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
saying
bull
can
stand
many
things
but
he
can
not
stand
two
per
cent
it
means
that
the
greatest
effect
of
the
three
great
causes
is
nearly
peculiar
to
england
here
and
here
almost
alone
the
excess
of
savings
over
investments
is
deposited
in
banks
here
and
here
only
is
it
made
use
of
so
as
to
affect
trade
at
large
here
and
here
only
are
prices
gravely
affected
in
these
circumstances
a
low
rate
of
interest
long
protracted
is
equivalent
to
a
total
depreciation
of
the
precious
metals
in
his
book
on
the
effect
of
the
great
gold
discoveries
professor
jevons
showed
and
so
far
as
i
know
was
the
first
to
show
the
necessity
of
eliminating
these
temporary
changes
of
value
in
gold
before
you
could
judge
properly
of
the
permanent
depreciation
he
proved
that
in
the
years
preceding
both
and
there
was
a
general
rise
of
prices
and
in
the
years
succeeding
these
years
a
great
fall
the
same
might
be
shown
of
the
years
before
and
after
and
at
the
present
moment
we
have
a
still
more
remarkable
example
which
was
thus
analysed
in
the
economist
of
the
december
in
an
article
which
i
venture
to
quote
as
a
whole
great
rise
in
the
price
of
commodities
persons
are
aware
that
the
trade
of
the
country
is
in
a
state
of
great
activity
all
the
usual
tests
indicate
that
the
state
of
the
revenue
the
bankers
figures
the
returns
of
exports
and
imports
are
all
plain
and
all
speak
the
same
language
but
few
have
we
think
considered
one
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
present
time
or
have
sufficiently
examined
its
consequences
that
feature
is
the
great
rise
in
the
price
of
most
of
the
leading
articles
of
trade
during
the
past
year
we
give
at
the
foot
of
this
paper
a
list
of
articles
comprising
most
articles
of
commerce
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
rise
of
price
though
not
universal
and
not
uniform
is
nevertheless
very
striking
and
very
general
the
most
remarkable
cases
are
january
december
l
l
wool
south
down
hogs
per
pack
cotton
upland
ordinary
per
lb
no
mule
yarn
per
lb
iron
bars
british
per

pig
no
clyde
per
ton
lead
per
ton
tin
per
ton
copper
sheeting
per
ton
wheat
gazette
average
per
qr
and
in
other
cases
there
is
a
tendency
upwards
in
price
much
more
often
than
there
is
a
tendency
downwards
general
rise
of
price
must
be
due
either
to
a
diminution
in
the
supply
of
the
quoted
articles
or
to
an
increased
demand
for
them
in
some
cases
there
has
no
doubt
been
a
short
supply
thus
in
wool
the
diminution
in
the
home
breed
of
sheep
has
had
a
great
effect
on
the
price
in
the
home
stock
of
sheep
was
in
diminution
equal
to
per
cent
and
in
the
case
of
some
other
articles
there
may
be
a
similar
cause
operating
but
taking
the
whole
mass
of
the
supply
of
commodities
in
this
country
as
shown
by
the
plain
test
of
the
quantities
imported
it
has
not
diminished
but
augmented
the
returns
of
the
board
of
trade
prove
this
in
the
most
striking
manner
and
we
give
below
a
table
of
some
of
the
important
articles
the
rise
in
prices
must
therefore
be
due
to
an
increased
demand
and
the
first
question
is
to
what
is
that
demand
due
believe
it
to
be
due
to
the
combined
operation
of
three
causes
cheap
money
cheap
corn
and
improved
credit
as
to
the
first
indeed
it
might
be
said
at
first
sight
that
so
general
an
increase
must
be
due
to
a
depreciation
of
the
precious
metals
certainly
in
many
controversies
facts
far
less
striking
have
been
alleged
as
proving
it
and
indeed
there
plainly
is
a
diminution
in
the
purchasing
power
of
money
though
that
diminution
is
not
general
and
permanent
but
local
and
temporary
the
peculiarity
of
the
precious
metals
is
that
their
value
depends
for
unusually
long
periods
on
the
quantity
of
them
which
is
in
the
market
in
the
long
run
their
value
like
that
of
all
others
is
determined
by
the
cost
at
which
they
can
be
brought
to
market
but
for
all
temporary
purposes
it
is
the
supply
in
the
market
which
governs
the
price
and
that
supply
in
this
country
is
exceedingly
variable
after
a
commercial
crisis
for
example
two
things
happen
first
we
call
in
the
debts
which
are
owing
to
us
in
foreign
countries
and
we
require
these
debts
to
be
paid
to
us
not
in
commodities
but
in
money
from
this
cause
principally
and
omitting
minor
causes
the
bullion
in
the
bank
of
england
which
was
in
may
rose
to
in
january
being
an
increase
of
over
and
then
there
comes
also
a
second
cause
tending
in
the
same
direction
during
a
depressed
period
the
savings
of
the
country
increase
considerably
faster
than
the
outlet
for
them
a
person
who
has
made
savings
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
and
this
new
unemployed
saving
means
additional
money
till
a
saving
is
invested
or
employed
it
exists
only
in
the
form
of
money
a
farmer
who
has
sold
his
wheat
and
has
the
good
holds
that
in
money
or
some
equivalent
for
money
till
he
sees
some
advantageous
use
to
be
made
of
it
probably
he
places
it
in
a
bank
and
this
enables
it
to
do
more
work
if
of
coin
be
deposited
in
a
bank
and
it
need
only
keep
as
a
reserve
that
sets
free
and
is
for
the
time
equivalent
to
an
increase
of
so
much
coin
as
a
principle
it
may
be
laid
down
that
all
new
unemployed
savings
require
an
increased
stock
of
the
precious
metals
or
an
increase
in
the
efficiency
of
the
banking
expedients
by
which
these
metals
are
in
other
words
in
a
saving
and
uninvesting
period
of
the
national
industry
we
accumulate
gold
and
augment
the
efficiency
of
our
gold
if
therefore
such
a
saving
period
follows
close
upon
an
occasion
when
foreign
credits
have
been
diminished
and
foreign
debts
called
in
the
augmentation
in
the
effective
quantity
of
gold
in
the
country
is
extremely
great
the
old
money
called
in
from
abroad
and
the
new
money
representing
the
new
saving
with
one
another
and
their
natural
tendency
is
to
cause
a
general
rise
in
price
and
what
is
the
same
thing
a
diffused
diminution
in
the
purchasing
power
of
money
to
this
point
there
is
nothing
special
in
the
recent
history
of
the
money
market
similar
events
happened
both
after
the
panic
of
and
after
that
of
but
there
is
another
cause
of
the
same
kind
and
acting
in
the
same
direction
which
is
peculiar
to
the
present
time
this
cause
is
the
amount
of
the
foreign
money
and
especially
of
the
money
of
foreign
governments
now
in
london
no
government
probably
ever
had
nearly
as
much
at
its
command
as
the
german
government
now
has
speaking
broadly
two
things
happened
during
the
war
england
was
the
best
place
of
shelter
for
foreign
money
and
this
made
money
more
cheap
here
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
after
the
war
england
became
the
most
convenient
paying
place
and
the
most
convenient
resting
place
for
money
and
this
again
has
made
money
cheaper
the
commercial
causes
for
which
there
are
many
precedents
have
been
aided
by
a
political
cause
for
the
efficacy
of
which
there
is
no
precedent
though
plentiful
money
is
necessary
to
high
prices
and
though
it
has
a
natural
tendency
to
produce
these
prices
yet
it
is
not
of
itself
sufficient
to
produce
them
in
the
cases
we
are
dealing
with
in
order
to
lower
prices
there
must
not
only
be
additional
money
but
a
satisfactory
mode
of
employing
that
additional
money
this
is
obvious
if
we
remember
whence
that
augmented
money
is
derived
it
is
derived
from
the
savings
of
the
people
and
will
only
be
invested
in
the
manner
which
the
holders
for
the
time
being
consider
suitable
to
such
savings
it
will
not
be
used
in
mere
expenditure
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
very
nature
of
it
so
to
use
it
a
new
channel
of
demand
is
required
to
take
off
the
new
money
or
that
new
money
will
not
raise
prices
it
will
lie
idle
in
the
banks
as
we
have
often
seen
it
we
should
still
see
the
frequent
the
common
phenomenon
of
dull
trade
and
cheap
money
existing
side
by
side
demand
in
this
case
arose
in
the
most
effective
of
all
ways
in
and
the
first
half
of
corn
was
dear
as
the
following
figures
show
gazette
average
price
of
wheat
december
january
february
march
april
may
june
july
august
september
october
november
december
january
february
march
april
may
june
july
from
that
time
it
fell
and
it
was
very
cheap
during
the
whole
of
and
the
effect
of
this
cheapness
is
great
in
every
department
of
industry
the
working
classes
having
cheaper
food
need
to
spend
so
much
less
on
that
food
and
have
more
to
spend
on
other
things
in
consequence
there
is
a
gentle
augmentation
of
demand
through
almost
all
departments
of
trade
and
this
almost
always
causes
a
great
augmentation
in
what
may
be
called
the
instrumental
trades
that
is
in
the
trades
which
deal
in
machines
and
instruments
used
in
many
branches
of
commerce
and
in
the
materials
for
such
take
for
instance
the
iron
trade
in
the
year
we
exported
tons
tons
tons
tons
tons
tons
increase
tons
that
is
to
say
cheap
corn
operating
throughout
the
world
created
a
new
demand
for
many
kinds
of
articles
the
production
of
a
large
number
of
such
articles
being
aided
by
iron
in
some
one
of
its
many
forms
iron
to
that
extent
was
exported
and
the
effect
is
cumulative
the
manufacture
of
iron
being
stimulated
all
persons
concerned
in
that
great
manufacture
are
well
off
have
more
to
spend
and
by
spending
it
encourage
other
branches
of
manufacture
which
again
propagate
the
demand
they
receive
and
so
encourage
industries
in
a
third
degree
dependent
and
removed
is
quite
true
that
corn
has
not
been
quite
so
cheap
during
the
present
year
but
even
if
it
had
been
dearer
than
it
is
it
would
not
all
at
once
arrest
the
great
trade
which
former
cheapness
had
created
the
ball
if
we
may
so
say
was
set
rolling
in
and
and
a
great
increase
of
demand
was
then
created
in
certain
trades
and
propagated
through
all
trades
a
continuance
of
very
high
prices
would
produce
the
reverse
effect
it
would
slacken
demand
in
certain
trades
and
the
effect
would
be
gradually
diffused
through
all
trades
but
a
slight
rise
such
as
that
of
this
year
has
no
perceptible
effect
the
stimulus
of
cheap
corn
is
added
to
that
of
cheap
money
the
full
conditions
of
a
great
and
diffused
rise
of
prices
are
satisfied
this
new
employment
supplies
a
mode
in
which
money
can
be
invested
bills
are
drawn
of
greater
number
and
greater
magnitude
and
through
the
agencies
of
banks
and
discount
houses
the
savings
of
the
country
are
invested
in
such
bills
there
is
thus
a
new
want
and
a
new
to
supply
that
want
and
the
consequence
is
the
diffused
and
remarkable
rise
of
price
which
the
figures
show
to
have
occurred
rise
has
also
been
aided
by
the
revival
of
credit
this
as
need
not
be
at
length
explained
is
a
great
aid
to
buying
and
consequently
a
great
aid
to
a
rise
of
price
since
credit
has
been
gradually
though
very
slowly
recovering
and
it
is
probably
as
good
as
it
is
reasonable
or
proper
that
it
should
be
we
are
now
trusting
as
many
people
as
we
ought
to
trust
and
as
yet
there
is
no
wild
excess
of
misplaced
confidence
which
would
make
us
trust
those
whom
we
ought
not
to
trust
the
process
thus
explained
is
the
common
process
the
surplus
of
loanable
capital
which
lies
in
the
hands
of
bankers
is
not
employed
by
them
in
any
original
way
it
is
almost
always
lent
to
a
trade
already
growing
and
already
improving
the
use
of
it
develops
that
trade
yet
farther
and
this
again
augments
and
stimulates
other
trades
capital
may
long
lie
idle
in
a
stagnant
condition
of
industry
the
mercantile
securities
which
experienced
bankers
know
to
be
good
do
not
augment
and
they
will
not
invent
other
securities
or
take
bad
ones
in
most
great
periods
of
expanding
industry
the
three
great
causes
much
loanable
capital
good
credit
and
the
increased
profits
derived
from
labour
and
capital
have
acted
simultaneously
and
though
either
may
act
by
itself
there
is
a
permanent
reason
why
mostly
they
will
act
together
they
both
tend
to
grow
together
if
you
begin
from
a
period
of
depression
in
such
periods
credit
is
bad
and
industry
unemployed
very
generally
provisions
are
high
in
price
and
their
dearness
was
one
of
the
causes
which
made
the
times
bad
whether
there
was
or
was
not
too
much
loanable
capital
when
that
period
begins
there
soon
comes
to
be
too
much
quiet
people
continue
to
save
part
of
their
incomes
in
bad
times
as
well
as
in
good
indeed
of
the
two
people
of
and
fixed
incomes
have
better
means
of
saving
in
bad
times
because
prices
are
lower
quiescent
trade
affords
no
new
securities
in
which
the
new
saving
can
be
invested
and
therefore
there
comes
soon
to
be
an
excess
of
loanable
capital
in
a
year
or
two
after
a
crisis
credit
usually
improves
as
the
remembrance
of
the
disasters
which
at
the
crisis
impaired
credit
is
becoming
fainter
and
fainter
provisions
get
back
to
their
usual
price
or
some
great
industry
makes
from
some
temporary
cause
a
quick
step
forward
at
these
moments
therefore
the
three
agencies
which
as
has
been
explained
greatly
develope
trade
combine
to
develope
it
simultaneously
the
certain
result
is
a
bound
of
national
prosperity
the
country
leaps
forward
as
if
by
magic
but
only
part
of
that
prosperity
has
a
solid
reason
as
far
as
prosperity
is
based
on
a
greater
quantity
of
production
and
that
of
the
right
articles
as
far
as
it
is
based
on
the
increased
rapidity
with
which
commodities
of
every
kind
reach
those
who
want
them
its
basis
is
good
human
industry
is
more
efficient
and
therefore
there
is
more
to
be
divided
among
mankind
but
in
so
far
as
that
prosperity
is
based
on
a
general
rise
of
prices
it
is
only
imaginary
a
general
rise
of
prices
is
a
rise
only
in
name
whatever
anyone
gains
on
the
article
which
he
has
to
sell
he
loses
on
the
articles
which
he
has
to
buy
and
so
he
is
just
where
he
was
the
only
real
effects
of
a
general
rise
of
prices
are
these
first
it
straitens
people
of
fixed
incomes
who
suffer
as
purchasers
but
who
have
no
gain
to
correspond
and
secondly
it
gives
an
extra
profit
to
fixed
capital
created
before
the
rise
happened
here
the
sellers
gain
but
without
any
equivalent
loss
as
buyers
thirdly
this
gain
on
fixed
capital
is
greatest
in
what
may
be
called
the
industrial
such
as
coal
and
iron
these
are
wanted
in
all
industries
and
in
any
general
increase
of
prices
they
are
sure
to
rise
much
more
than
other
things
everybody
wants
them
the
supply
of
them
can
not
be
rapidly
augmented
and
therefore
their
price
rises
very
quickly
but
to
the
country
as
a
whole
the
general
rise
of
prices
is
no
benefit
at
all
it
is
simply
a
change
of
nomenclature
for
an
identical
relative
value
in
the
same
commodities
nevertheless
most
people
are
happier
for
it
they
think
they
are
getting
richer
though
they
are
not
and
as
the
rise
does
not
happen
on
all
articles
at
the
same
moment
but
is
propagated
gradually
through
society
those
to
whom
it
first
comes
gain
really
and
as
at
first
every
one
believes
that
he
will
gain
when
his
own
article
is
rising
a
buoyant
cheerfulness
overflows
the
mercantile
world
this
prosperity
is
precarious
as
far
as
it
is
real
and
transitory
in
so
far
as
it
is
fictitious
the
augmented
production
which
is
the
reason
of
the
real
prosperity
depends
on
the
full
working
of
the
whole
industrial
organisation
of
all
capitalists
and
labourers
that
prosperity
was
caused
by
that
full
working
and
will
cease
with
it
but
that
full
working
is
liable
to
be
destroyed
by
the
occurrence
of
any
great
misfortune
to
any
considerable
industry
this
would
cause
misfortune
to
the
industries
dependent
on
that
one
and
as
has
been
explained
all
through
society
and
back
again
but
every
such
industry
is
liable
to
grave
fluctuations
and
the
most
important
the
provision
industries
to
the
gravest
and
the
suddenest
they
are
dependent
on
the
casualties
of
the
seasons
a
single
bad
harvest
diffused
over
the
world
a
succession
of
two
or
three
bad
harvests
even
in
england
only
will
raise
the
price
of
corn
exceedingly
and
will
keep
it
high
and
a
great
and
protracted
rise
in
the
price
of
corn
will
at
once
destroy
all
the
real
part
of
the
unusual
prosperity
of
previous
good
times
it
will
change
the
full
working
of
the
industrial
machine
into
an
imperfect
working
it
will
make
the
produce
of
that
machine
less
than
usual
instead
of
more
than
usual
instead
of
there
being
more
than
the
average
of
general
dividend
to
be
distributed
between
the
producers
there
will
immediately
be
less
than
the
average
and
in
so
far
as
the
apparent
prosperity
is
caused
by
an
unusual
plentifulness
of
loanable
capital
and
a
consequent
rise
in
prices
that
prosperity
is
not
only
liable
to
reaction
but
certain
to
be
exposed
to
reaction
the
same
causes
which
generate
this
prosperity
will
after
they
have
been
acting
a
little
longer
generate
an
equivalent
adversity
the
process
is
this
the
plentifulness
of
loanable
capital
causes
a
rise
of
prices
that
rise
of
prices
makes
it
necessary
to
have
more
loanable
capital
to
carry
on
the
same
trade
will
not
buy
as
much
when
prices
are
high
as
it
will
when
prices
are
low
it
will
not
be
so
effectual
for
carrying
on
business
more
money
is
necessary
in
dear
times
than
in
cheap
times
to
produce
the
same
changes
in
the
same
commodities
even
supposing
trade
to
have
remained
stationary
a
greater
capital
would
be
required
to
carry
it
on
after
such
a
rise
of
prices
as
has
been
described
than
was
necessary
before
that
rise
but
in
this
case
the
trade
will
not
have
remained
stationary
it
will
have
increased
certainly
to
some
extent
probably
to
a
great
extent
the
capital
the
lending
of
which
caused
the
rise
of
prices
was
lent
to
enable
it
to
augment
the
loanable
capital
lay
idle
in
the
banks
till
some
trade
started
into
prosperity
and
then
was
lent
in
order
to
develope
that
trade
that
trade
caused
other
secondary
developments
those
secondary
developments
enabled
more
loanable
capital
to
be
lent
and
that
lending
caused
a
tertiary
development
of
trade
and
so
on
through
society
in
consequence
a
low
rate
of
interest
is
almost
always
followed
by
a
rapid
rise
in
that
rate
till
the
available
trade
is
found
it
lies
idle
and
can
scarcely
be
lent
at
all
some
of
it
is
not
lent
but
the
moment
the
available
trade
is
discovered
the
moment
that
prices
have
risen
the
demand
for
loanable
capital
becomes
keen
for
the
most
part
men
of
business
must
carry
on
their
regular
trade
if
it
can
not
be
carried
on
without
borrowing
per
cent
more
capital
per
cent
more
capital
they
must
borrow
very
often
they
have
incurred
obligations
which
must
be
met
and
if
that
is
so
the
rate
of
interest
which
they
pay
is
comparatively
indifferent
what
is
necessary
to
meet
their
acceptances
they
will
borrow
pay
for
it
what
they
may
they
had
better
pay
any
price
than
permit
those
acceptances
to
be
dishonoured
and
in
less
extreme
eases
men
of
business
have
a
fixed
capital
which
can
not
lie
idle
except
at
a
great
loss
a
set
of
labourers
which
must
be
if
possible
kept
together
a
steady
connection
of
customers
which
they
would
very
unwillingly
lose
to
keep
all
these
they
borrow
and
in
a
period
of
high
prices
many
merchants
are
peculiarly
anxious
to
borrow
because
the
augmentation
of
the
price
of
the
article
in
which
they
deal
makes
them
really
see
or
imagine
that
they
see
peculiar
opportunities
of
profit
an
immense
new
borrowing
soon
follows
upon
the
new
and
great
trade
and
the
rate
of
interest
rises
at
once
and
generally
rises
rapidly
this
is
the
surer
to
happen
that
lombard
street
is
as
has
been
shown
before
a
very
delicate
market
a
large
amount
of
money
is
held
there
by
bankers
and
by
at
interest
this
they
must
employ
or
they
will
be
ruined
it
is
better
for
them
to
reduce
the
rate
they
charge
and
compensate
themselves
by
reducing
the
rate
they
pay
rather
than
to
keep
up
the
rate
of
charge
if
by
so
doing
they
can
not
employ
all
their
money
it
is
vital
to
them
to
employ
all
the
money
on
which
they
pay
interest
a
little
excess
therefore
forces
down
the
rate
of
interest
very
much
but
if
that
low
rate
of
interest
should
cause
or
should
aid
in
causing
a
great
growth
of
trade
the
rise
is
sure
to
be
quick
and
is
apt
to
be
violent
the
figures
of
trade
are
reckoned
by
hundreds
of
millions
where
those
of
loanable
capital
count
only
by
millions
a
great
increase
in
the
borrowing
demands
of
english
commerce
almost
always
changes
an
excess
of
loanable
capital
above
the
demand
to
a
greater
deficiency
below
the
demand
that
deficiency
causes
adversity
or
apparent
adversity
in
trade
just
as
and
in
the
same
manner
that
the
previous
excess
caused
prosperity
or
apparent
prosperity
it
causes
a
fall
of
price
that
runs
through
society
that
fall
causes
a
decline
of
activity
and
a
diminution
of
profits
a
painful
contraction
instead
of
the
previous
pleasant
expansion
the
change
is
generally
quicker
because
some
check
to
credit
happens
at
an
early
stage
of
it
the
mercantile
community
will
have
been
unusually
fortunate
if
during
the
period
of
rising
prices
it
has
not
made
great
mistakes
such
a
period
naturally
excites
the
sanguine
and
the
ardent
they
fancy
that
the
prosperity
they
see
will
last
always
that
it
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
greater
prosperity
they
altogether
the
demand
for
the
article
they
deal
in
or
the
work
they
do
they
all
in
their
degree
and
the
ablest
and
the
cleverest
the
most
work
much
more
than
they
should
and
trade
far
above
their
means
every
great
crisis
reveals
the
excessive
speculations
of
many
houses
which
no
one
before
suspected
and
which
commonly
indeed
had
not
begun
or
had
not
carried
very
far
those
speculations
till
they
were
tempted
by
the
daily
rise
of
price
and
the
surrounding
fever
the
case
is
worse
because
at
most
periods
of
great
commercial
excitement
there
is
some
mixture
of
the
older
and
simpler
kind
of
investing
mania
though
the
money
of
saving
persons
is
in
the
hands
of
banks
and
though
by
offering
interest
banks
retain
the
command
of
much
of
it
yet
they
do
not
retain
the
command
of
the
whole
or
anything
near
the
whole
all
of
it
can
be
used
and
much
of
it
is
used
by
its
owners
they
speculate
with
it
in
bubble
companies
and
in
worthless
shares
just
as
they
did
in
the
time
of
the
south
sea
mania
when
there
were
no
banks
and
as
they
would
again
in
england
supposing
that
banks
ceased
to
exist
the
mania
of
and
the
mania
of
were
striking
examples
of
this
in
their
case
to
a
great
extent
as
in
most
similar
modern
periods
to
a
less
extent
the
delirium
of
ancient
gambling
with
the
milder
madness
of
modern
overtrading
at
the
very
beginning
of
adversity
the
counters
in
the
gambling
mama
the
shares
in
the
companies
created
to
feed
the
mania
are
discovered
to
be
worthless
down
they
all
go
and
with
them
much
of
credit
the
good
times
too
of
high
price
almost
always
engender
much
fraud
all
people
are
most
credulous
when
they
are
most
happy
and
when
much
money
has
just
been
made
when
some
people
are
really
making
it
when
most
people
think
they
are
making
it
there
is
a
happy
opportunity
for
ingenious
mendacity
almost
everything
will
be
believed
for
a
little
while
and
long
before
discovery
the
worst
and
most
adroit
deceivers
are
geographically
or
legally
beyond
the
reach
of
punishment
but
the
harm
they
have
done
diffuses
harm
for
it
weakens
credit
still
farther
when
we
understand
that
lombard
street
is
subject
to
severe
alternations
of
opposite
causes
we
should
cease
to
be
surprised
at
its
seeming
cycles
we
should
cease
too
to
be
surprised
at
the
sudden
panics
during
the
period
of
reaction
and
adversity
just
even
at
the
last
instant
of
prosperity
the
whole
structure
is
delicate
the
peculiar
essence
of
our
banking
system
is
an
unprecedented
trust
between
man
and
man
and
when
that
trust
is
much
weakened
by
hidden
causes
a
small
accident
may
greatly
hurt
it
and
a
great
accident
for
a
moment
may
almost
destroy
it
now
too
that
we
comprehend
the
inevitable
vicissitudes
of
lombard
street
we
can
also
thoroughly
comprehend
the
cardinal
importance
of
always
retaining
a
great
banking
reserve
whether
the
times
of
adversity
are
well
met
or
ill
met
depends
far
more
on
this
than
on
any
other
single
circumstance
if
the
reserve
be
large
its
magnitude
sustains
credit
and
if
it
be
small
its
diminution
stimulates
the
gravest
apprehensions
and
the
better
we
comprehend
the
importance
of
the
banking
reserve
the
higher
we
shall
estimate
the
responsibility
of
those
who
keep
it
chapter
vii
a
more
exact
account
of
the
mode
in
which
the
bank
of
england
has
discharged
its
duty
of
retaining
a
good
bank
reserve
and
of
administering
it
effectually
the
preceding
chapters
have
in
some
degree
enabled
us
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
the
duties
which
the
bank
of
england
is
bound
to
discharge
as
to
its
banking
reserve
if
we
ask
how
the
bank
of
england
has
discharged
this
great
responsibility
we
shall
be
struck
by
three
things
first
as
has
been
said
before
the
bank
has
never
by
any
corporate
act
or
authorised
utterance
acknowledged
the
duty
and
some
of
its
directors
deny
it
second
what
is
even
more
remarkable
no
resolution
of
parliament
no
report
of
any
committee
of
parliament
as
far
as
i
know
no
remembered
speech
of
a
responsible
statesman
has
assigned
or
enforced
that
duty
on
the
bank
third
what
is
more
remarkable
still
the
distinct
teaching
of
our
highest
authorities
has
often
been
that
no
public
duty
of
any
kind
is
imposed
on
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
that
for
banking
purposes
it
is
only
a
joint
stock
bank
like
any
other
bank
that
its
managers
should
look
only
to
the
interest
of
the
proprietors
and
their
dividend
that
they
are
to
manage
as
the
london
and
westminster
bank
or
the
union
bank
manages
at
first
it
seems
exceedingly
strange
that
so
important
a
responsibility
should
be
unimposed
unacknowledged
and
denied
but
the
explanation
is
this
we
are
living
amid
the
vestiges
of
old
controversies
and
we
speak
their
language
though
we
are
dealing
with
different
thoughts
and
different
facts
for
more
than
fifty
years
from
down
to
there
was
a
keen
controversy
as
to
the
public
duties
of
the
bank
it
was
said
to
be
the
of
the
paper
currency
and
on
that
account
many
expected
much
good
from
it
others
said
it
did
great
harm
others
again
that
it
could
do
neither
good
nor
harm
but
for
the
whole
period
there
was
an
incessant
and
fierce
discussion
that
discussion
was
terminated
by
the
act
of
by
that
act
the
currency
manages
itself
the
entire
working
is
automatic
the
bank
of
england
plainly
does
not
manage
can
not
even
be
said
to
manage
the
currency
any
more
and
naturally
but
rashly
the
only
reason
upon
which
a
public
responsibility
used
to
be
assigned
to
the
bank
having
now
clearly
come
to
an
end
it
was
inferred
by
many
that
the
bank
had
no
responsibility
the
complete
uncertainty
as
to
the
degree
of
responsibility
acknowledged
by
the
bank
of
england
is
best
illustrated
by
what
has
been
said
by
the
bank
directors
themselves
as
to
the
panic
of
the
panic
of
that
year
it
will
be
remembered
happened
contrary
to
precedent
in
the
spring
and
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
court
of
bank
proprietors
the
september
meeting
there
was
a
very
remarkable
discussion
which
i
give
at
length
below
and
of
which
all
that
is
most
material
was
thus
described
in
the
great
importance
of
the
late
meeting
of
the
proprietors
of
the
bank
of
england
late
meeting
of
the
proprietors
of
the
bank
of
england
has
a
very
unusual
importance
there
can
be
no
effectual
inquiry
now
into
the
history
of
the
late
crisis
a
parliamentary
committee
next
year
would
unless
something
strange
occur
in
the
interval
be
a
great
waste
of
time
men
of
business
have
keen
sensations
but
short
memories
and
they
will
care
no
more
next
february
for
the
events
of
last
may
than
they
now
care
for
the
events
of
october
a
inquiry
on
which
no
real
mind
is
spent
and
which
everyone
knows
will
lead
to
nothing
is
far
worse
than
no
inquiry
at
all
under
these
circumstances
the
official
statements
of
the
governor
of
the
bank
are
the
only
authentic
expositions
we
shall
have
of
the
policy
of
the
bank
directors
whether
as
respects
the
past
or
the
future
and
when
we
examine
the
proceedings
with
care
we
shall
find
that
they
contain
matter
of
the
gravest
import
meeting
may
be
considered
to
admit
and
recognise
the
fact
that
the
bank
of
england
keeps
the
sole
banking
reserve
of
the
country
we
do
not
now
mix
up
this
matter
with
the
country
circulation
or
the
question
whether
there
should
be
many
issuers
of
notes
or
only
one
we
speak
not
of
the
currency
reserve
but
of
the
banking
reserve
the
reserve
held
against
deposits
and
not
the
reserve
held
against
notes
we
have
often
insisted
in
these
columns
that
the
bank
of
england
does
keep
the
sole
real
reserve
the
sole
considerable
unoccupied
mass
of
cash
in
the
country
but
there
has
been
no
universal
agreement
about
it
great
authorities
have
been
unwilling
to
admit
it
they
have
not
indeed
formally
and
explicitly
contended
against
it
if
they
had
they
must
have
pointed
out
some
other
great
store
of
unused
cash
besides
that
at
the
bank
and
they
could
not
find
such
store
but
they
have
attempted
distinctions
have
said
that
the
doctrine
that
the
bank
of
england
keeps
the
sole
banking
reserve
of
the
country
was
not
a
good
way
of
putting
it
was
exaggerated
and
was
calculated
to
mislead
the
late
meeting
is
a
complete
admission
that
such
is
the
fact
the
governor
of
the
bank
said
great
strain
has
within
the
last
few
months
been
put
upon
the
resources
of
this
house
and
of
the
whole
banking
community
of
london
and
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
say
that
not
only
this
house
but
the
entire
banking
body
acquitted
themselves
most
honourably
and
creditably
throughout
that
very
trying
period
banking
is
a
very
peculiar
business
and
it
depends
so
much
upon
credit
that
the
least
blast
of
suspicion
is
sufficient
to
sweep
away
as
it
were
the
harvest
of
a
whole
year
but
the
manner
in
which
the
banking
establishments
generally
in
london
met
the
demands
made
upon
them
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
past
affords
a
most
satisfactory
proof
of
the
soundness
of
the
principles
on
which
their
business
is
conducted
this
house
exerted
itself
to
the
utmost
and
exerted
itself
most
successfully
to
meet
the
crisis
we
did
not
flinch
from
our
post
when
the
storm
came
upon
us
on
the
morning
on
which
it
became
known
that
the
house
of
overend
and
had
failed
we
were
in
as
sound
and
healthy
a
position
as
any
banking
establishment
could
hold
and
on
that
day
and
throughout
the
succeeding
week
we
made
advances
which
would
hardly
be
credited
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
would
have
thought
of
predicting
even
at
the
shortest
period
beforehand
the
greatness
of
those
advances
it
was
not
unnatural
that
in
this
state
of
things
a
certain
degree
of
alarm
should
have
taken
possession
of
the
public
mind
and
that
those
who
required
accommodation
from
the
bank
should
have
gone
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
requested
the
government
to
empower
us
to
issue
notes
beyond
the
statutory
amount
if
we
should
think
that
such
a
measure
was
desirable
but
we
had
to
act
before
we
could
receive
any
such
power
and
before
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
was
perhaps
out
of
his
bed
we
had
advanced
of
our
reserves
which
were
certainly
thus
reduced
to
an
amount
which
we
could
not
witness
without
regret
but
we
would
not
flinch
from
the
duty
which
we
conceived
was
imposed
upon
us
of
supporting
the
banking
community
and
i
am
not
aware
that
any
legitimate
application
made
for
assistance
to
this
house
was
refused
every
gentleman
who
came
here
with
adequate
security
was
liberally
dealt
with
and
if
accommodation
could
not
be
afforded
to
the
full
extent
which
was
demanded
no
one
who
offered
proper
security
failed
to
obtain
relief
from
this
house
this
is
distinctly
saying
that
the
other
banks
of
the
country
need
not
keep
any
such
banking
reserve
any
such
sum
of
actual
cash
of
real
sovereigns
and
bank
notes
as
will
help
them
through
a
sudden
panic
it
acknowledges
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
bank
of
england
to
support
the
banking
community
to
make
the
reserve
of
the
bank
of
england
do
for
them
as
well
as
for
itself
our
judgment
this
language
is
most
just
and
the
governor
of
the
bank
could
scarcely
have
done
a
greater
public
service
than
by
using
language
so
and
so
distinct
let
us
know
precisely
who
is
to
keep
the
banking
reserve
if
the
joint
stock
banks
and
the
private
banks
and
the
country
banks
are
to
keep
their
share
let
us
determine
on
that
gladstone
appeared
not
long
since
to
say
in
parliament
that
it
ought
to
be
so
but
at
any
rate
there
should
be
no
doubt
whose
duty
it
is
upon
grounds
which
we
have
often
stated
we
believe
that
the
anomaly
of
one
bank
keeping
the
sole
banking
reserve
is
so
fixed
in
our
system
that
we
can
not
change
it
if
we
would
the
great
evil
to
be
feared
was
an
indistinct
conception
of
the
fact
and
that
is
now
avoided
importance
of
these
declarations
by
the
bank
is
greater
because
after
the
panic
of
the
bank
did
not
hold
exactly
the
same
language
a
person
who
loves
concise
expressions
said
lately
that
overends
broke
the
bank
in
because
it
went
and
in
because
it
was
not
let
go
we
need
not
too
precisely
examine
such
language
the
element
of
truth
in
it
is
very
plain
the
great
advances
made
to
overends
were
a
principal
event
in
the
panic
of
the
were
then
very
much
what
the
bankers
were
lately
they
were
the
borrowers
who
wanted
sudden
and
incalculable
advances
but
the
were
told
not
to
expect
the
like
again
but
alderman
salomons
on
the
part
of
the
london
bankers
said
he
wished
to
take
that
opportunity
of
stating
that
he
believed
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
to
the
managers
and
shareholders
of
joint
stock
banks
than
the
testimony
which
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
had
that
day
borne
to
the
sound
and
honourable
manner
in
which
their
business
was
conducted
it
was
manifestly
desirable
that
the
joint
stock
banks
and
the
banking
interest
generally
should
work
in
harmony
with
the
bank
of
england
and
he
sincerely
thanked
the
governor
of
the
bank
for
the
kindly
manner
in
which
he
had
alluded
to
the
mode
in
which
the
joint
stock
banks
had
met
the
late
monetary
crisis
the
bank
of
england
agrees
to
give
other
banks
the
requisite
assistance
in
case
of
need
and
the
other
banks
agree
to
ask
for
it
the
bank
agrees
in
fact
if
not
in
name
to
make
limited
advances
on
proper
security
to
anyone
who
applies
for
it
on
the
present
occasion
was
so
advanced
in
three
months
and
the
bank
do
not
say
to
the
mercantile
community
or
to
the
bankers
do
not
come
to
us
again
we
helped
you
once
but
do
not
look
upon
it
as
a
precedent
we
will
not
help
you
again
on
the
contrary
the
evident
and
intended
implication
is
that
under
like
circumstances
the
bank
would
act
again
as
it
has
now
acted
this
article
was
much
disliked
by
many
of
the
bank
directors
and
especially
by
some
whose
opinion
is
of
great
authority
they
thought
that
the
drew
deductions
from
a
speech
which
was
in
itself
to
some
objection
was
like
all
such
speeches
defective
in
theoretical
precision
and
which
was
at
best
only
the
expression
of
an
opinion
by
the
governor
of
that
day
which
had
not
been
authorised
by
the
court
of
directors
which
could
not
bind
the
bank
however
the
article
had
at
least
this
use
that
it
brought
out
the
facts
all
the
directors
would
have
felt
a
difficulty
in
commenting
upon
or
limiting
or
in
differing
from
a
speech
of
a
governor
from
the
chair
but
there
was
no
difficulty
or
delicacy
in
attacking
the
accordingly
hankey
one
of
the
most
experienced
bank
directors
not
long
after
took
occasion
to
observe
economist
newspaper
has
put
forth
what
in
my
opinion
is
the
most
mischievous
doctrine
ever
broached
in
the
monetary
or
banking
world
in
this
country
viz
that
it
is
the
proper
function
of
the
bank
of
england
to
keep
money
available
at
all
times
to
supply
the
demands
of
bankers
who
have
rendered
their
own
assets
unavailable
until
such
a
doctrine
is
repudiated
by
the
banking
interest
the
difficulty
of
pursuing
any
sound
principle
of
banking
in
london
will
be
always
very
great
but
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
doctrine
as
that
bankers
are
justified
in
relying
on
the
bank
of
england
to
assist
them
in
time
of
need
is
generally
held
by
the
bankers
in
london
consider
it
to
be
the
undoubted
duty
of
the
bank
of
england
to
hold
its
banking
deposits
reserving
generally
about
in
cash
in
the
most
available
securities
and
in
the
event
of
a
sudden
pressure
in
the
money
market
by
whatever
circumstance
it
may
be
caused
to
bear
its
full
share
of
a
drain
on
its
resources
i
am
ready
to
admit
however
that
a
general
opinion
has
long
prevailed
that
the
bank
of
england
ought
to
be
prepared
to
do
much
more
than
this
though
i
confess
my
surprise
at
finding
an
advocate
for
such
an
opinion
in
the
economist
if
it
were
practicable
for
the
bank
to
retain
money
unemployed
to
meet
such
an
emergency
it
would
be
a
very
unwise
thing
to
do
so
but
i
contend
that
it
is
quite
impracticable
and
if
it
were
possible
it
would
be
most
inexpedient
and
i
can
only
express
my
regret
that
the
bank
from
a
desire
to
do
everything
in
its
power
to
afford
general
assistance
in
times
of
banking
or
commercial
distress
should
ever
have
acted
in
a
way
to
encourage
such
an
opinion
the
more
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
bank
is
made
to
assimilate
to
the
conduct
of
every
other
bank
in
the
united
kingdom
the
better
for
the
bank
and
the
better
for
the
community
at
large
i
am
scarcely
a
judge
but
i
do
not
think
hankey
replies
to
the
very
conclusively
first
he
should
have
observed
that
the
question
is
not
as
to
what
to
be
but
as
to
what
is
the
did
not
say
that
the
system
of
a
single
bank
reserve
was
a
good
system
but
that
it
was
the
system
which
existed
and
which
must
be
worked
as
you
could
not
change
it
secondly
hankey
should
have
shown
other
store
of
unused
cash
except
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
out
of
which
advances
in
time
of
panic
could
be
made
these
advances
are
necessary
and
must
be
made
by
someone
the
of
london
bankers
are
not
such
store
they
are
used
cash
not
unused
they
are
part
of
the
bank
deposits
and
lent
as
such
thirdly
hankey
should
have
observed
that
we
know
by
the
published
figures
that
the
joint
stock
banks
of
london
do
not
keep
or
anything
like
of
their
liabilities
in
even
meaning
by
a
deposit
at
the
bank
of
england
of
the
deposits
in
joint
stock
banks
not
to
speak
of
the
private
banks
would
be
and
the
private
deposits
of
the
bank
of
england
are
according
to
his
own
statement
there
is
a
conspicuous
contrast
the
joint
stock
banks
and
the
private
banks
no
doubt
too
keep
one
sort
of
reserve
and
the
bank
of
england
a
different
kind
of
reserve
altogether
hankey
says
that
the
two
ought
to
be
managed
on
the
same
principle
but
if
so
he
should
have
said
whether
he
would
assimilate
the
practice
of
the
bank
of
england
to
that
of
the
other
banks
or
that
of
the
other
banks
to
the
practice
of
the
bank
of
england
fourthly
hankey
should
have
observed
that
as
has
been
explained
in
most
panics
the
principal
use
of
a
is
not
to
advance
to
bankers
the
largest
amount
is
almost
always
advanced
to
the
mercantile
public
and
to
but
the
point
is
that
by
our
system
all
extra
pressure
is
thrown
upon
the
bank
of
england
in
the
worst
part
of
the
crisis
of
money
could
not
be
borrowed
even
on
the
best
security
even
on
consols
except
at
the
bank
of
england
there
was
no
other
lender
to
new
borrowers
but
my
object
now
is
not
to
revive
a
past
controversy
but
to
show
in
what
an
unsatisfactory
and
uncertain
condition
that
controversy
has
left
a
most
important
subject
hankey
is
the
last
explanation
we
have
had
of
the
policy
of
the
bank
he
is
a
very
experienced
and
attentive
director
and
i
think
expresses
more
or
less
the
opinions
of
other
directors
and
what
do
we
find
setting
aside
and
saying
nothing
about
the
remarkable
speech
of
the
governor
in
which
at
least
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
was
clear
and
excellent
hankey
leaves
us
in
doubt
altogether
as
to
what
will
be
the
policy
of
the
bank
of
england
in
the
next
panic
and
as
to
what
amount
of
aid
the
public
may
then
expect
from
it
his
words
are
too
vague
no
one
can
tell
what
a
share
means
still
less
can
we
tell
what
other
people
at
some
future
time
will
say
it
means
theory
suggests
and
experience
proves
that
in
a
panic
the
holders
of
the
ultimate
bank
reserve
whether
one
bank
or
many
should
lend
to
all
that
bring
good
securities
quickly
freely
and
readily
by
that
policy
they
allay
a
panic
by
every
other
policy
they
intensify
it
the
public
have
a
right
to
know
whether
the
bank
of
england
the
holders
of
our
ultimate
bank
reserve
acknowledge
this
duty
and
are
ready
to
perform
it
but
this
is
now
very
uncertain
if
we
refer
to
history
and
examine
what
in
fact
has
been
the
conduct
of
the
bank
directors
we
find
that
they
have
acted
exactly
as
persons
of
their
type
character
and
position
might
have
been
expected
to
act
they
are
a
board
of
plain
sensible
prosperous
english
merchants
and
they
have
both
done
and
left
undone
what
such
a
board
might
have
been
expected
to
do
and
not
to
do
nobody
could
expect
great
attainments
in
economical
science
from
such
a
board
laborious
study
is
for
the
most
part
foreign
to
the
habits
of
english
merchants
nor
could
we
expect
original
views
on
banking
for
banking
is
a
special
trade
and
english
merchants
as
a
body
have
had
no
experience
in
it
a
can
scarcely
ever
make
improvements
for
the
policy
of
a
board
is
determined
by
the
opinions
of
the
most
numerous
class
of
its
members
its
average
members
and
these
are
never
prepared
for
sudden
improvements
a
board
of
upright
and
sensible
merchants
will
always
act
according
to
what
it
considers
principles
that
is
according
to
the
received
maxims
of
the
mercantile
world
then
and
there
and
in
this
manner
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
have
acted
nearly
uniformly
their
strength
and
their
weakness
were
curiously
exemplified
at
the
time
when
they
had
the
most
power
after
the
suspension
of
cash
payments
in
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
could
issue
what
notes
they
liked
there
was
no
check
these
notes
could
not
come
back
upon
the
bank
for
payment
there
was
a
great
temptation
to
extravagant
issue
and
no
present
penalty
upon
it
but
the
directors
of
the
bank
withstood
the
temptation
they
did
not
issue
their
inconvertible
notes
extravagantly
and
the
proof
is
that
for
more
than
ten
years
after
the
suspension
of
cash
payments
the
bank
paper
was
undepreciated
and
circulated
at
no
discount
in
comparison
with
gold
though
the
bank
directors
of
that
day
at
last
fell
into
errors
yet
on
the
whole
they
acted
with
singular
judgment
and
moderation
but
when
in
they
came
to
be
examined
as
to
their
reasons
they
gave
answers
that
have
become
almost
classical
by
their
nonsense
pearse
the
governor
of
the
bank
said
considering
this
subject
with
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
are
issued
resulting
from
the
applications
made
for
discounts
to
supply
the
necessary
want
of
by
which
their
issue
in
amount
is
so
controlled
that
it
can
never
amount
to
an
excess
i
can
not
see
how
the
amount
of
issued
can
operate
upon
the
price
of
bullion
or
the
state
of
the
exchanges
and
therefore
i
am
individually
of
opinion
that
the
price
of
bullion
or
the
state
of
the
exchanges
can
never
be
a
reason
for
lessening
the
amount
of
to
be
issued
always
understanding
the
control
which
i
have
already
described
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
the
same
opinion
which
has
now
been
expressed
by
the
whitmore
i
am
so
much
of
the
same
opinion
that
i
never
think
it
necessary
to
advert
to
the
price
of
gold
or
the
state
of
the
exchange
on
the
days
on
which
we
make
our
advances
you
advert
to
these
two
circumstances
with
a
view
to
regulate
the
general
amount
of
your
advances
i
do
not
advert
to
it
with
a
view
to
our
general
advances
conceiving
it
not
to
bear
upon
the
question
and
harman
another
bank
director
expressed
his
opinion
in
these
terms
must
very
materially
alter
my
opinions
before
i
can
suppose
that
the
exchanges
will
be
influenced
by
any
modifications
of
our
paper
currency
very
few
persons
perhaps
could
have
managed
to
commit
so
many
blunders
in
so
few
words
but
it
is
no
disgrace
at
all
to
the
bank
directors
of
that
day
to
have
committed
these
blunders
they
spoke
according
to
the
best
mercantile
opinion
of
england
the
city
of
london
and
the
house
of
commons
both
approved
of
what
they
said
those
who
dissented
were
said
to
be
abstract
thinkers
and
unpractical
men
the
bank
directors
adopted
the
ordinary
opinions
and
pursued
the
usual
practice
of
their
time
it
was
this
that
caused
their
moderation
they
believed
that
so
long
as
they
issued
only
at
per
cent
and
only
on
the
discount
of
good
bills
those
notes
could
not
be
depreciated
and
as
the
number
of
bills
bills
which
sound
merchants
know
to
be
good
does
not
rapidly
increase
and
as
the
market
rate
of
interest
was
often
less
than
per
cent
these
checks
on
were
very
effective
they
failed
in
time
and
the
theory
upon
which
they
were
defended
was
nonsense
but
for
a
time
their
operation
was
powerful
and
excellent
unluckily
in
the
management
of
the
matter
before
us
the
management
of
the
bank
reserve
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
were
neither
acquainted
with
right
principles
nor
were
they
protected
by
a
judicious
routine
they
could
not
be
expected
themselves
to
discover
such
principles
the
abstract
thinking
of
the
world
is
never
to
be
expected
from
persons
in
high
places
the
administration
of
current
transactions
is
a
most
engrossing
business
and
those
charged
with
them
are
usually
but
little
inclined
to
think
on
points
of
theory
even
when
such
thinking
most
nearly
concerns
those
transactions
no
doubt
when
men
own
fortunes
are
at
stake
the
instinct
of
the
trader
does
somehow
anticipate
the
conclusions
of
the
closet
but
a
board
has
no
instincts
when
it
is
not
getting
an
income
for
its
members
and
when
it
is
only
discharging
a
duty
of
office
during
the
suspension
of
cash
payments
a
suspension
which
lasted
years
all
traditions
as
to
a
cash
reserve
had
died
away
after
the
bank
directors
had
to
discharge
the
duty
of
keeping
a
banking
reserve
and
as
the
law
then
stood
a
currency
reserve
also
without
the
guidance
either
of
keen
interests
or
good
principles
or
wise
traditions
under
such
circumstances
the
bank
directors
inevitably
made
mistakes
of
the
gravest
magnitude
the
first
time
of
trial
came
in
in
that
year
the
bank
directors
allowed
their
stock
of
bullion
to
fall
in
the
most
alarming
manner
on
the
coin
and
bullion
in
the
bank
was
l
on
it
was
reduced
to
l
and
the
consequence
was
a
panic
so
tremendous
that
its
results
are
well
remembered
after
nearly
fifty
years
in
the
next
period
of
extreme
trial
in
the
bank
was
compelled
to
draw
for
on
the
bank
of
france
and
even
after
that
aid
the
directors
permitted
their
bullion
which
was
still
the
currency
reserve
as
well
as
the
banking
reserve
to
be
reduced
to
a
great
alarm
pervaded
society
and
generated
an
eager
controversy
out
of
which
ultimately
emerged
the
act
of
the
next
trial
came
in
and
then
the
bank
permitted
its
banking
reserve
which
the
law
had
now
distinctly
separated
to
fall
to
and
so
intense
was
the
alarm
that
the
executive
government
issued
a
letter
of
licence
permitting
the
bank
if
necessary
to
break
the
new
law
and
if
necessary
to
borrow
from
the
currency
reserve
which
was
full
in
aid
of
the
banking
reserve
which
was
empty
till
there
was
an
unusual
calm
in
the
money
market
but
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
the
bank
directors
let
the
banking
reserve
which
even
in
october
was
far
too
small
fall
thus
l
l
l
l
l
l
and
then
a
letter
of
licence
like
that
of
was
not
only
issued
but
used
the
ministry
of
the
day
authorised
the
bank
to
borrow
from
the
currency
reserve
in
aid
of
the
banking
reserve
and
the
bank
of
england
did
so
borrow
several
hundred
pounds
till
the
end
of
the
month
of
november
a
more
miserable
catalogue
than
that
of
the
failures
of
the
bank
of
england
to
keep
a
good
banking
reserve
in
all
the
seasons
of
trouble
between
and
is
scarcely
to
be
found
in
history
but
since
there
has
been
a
great
improvement
by
painful
events
and
incessant
discussions
men
of
business
have
now
been
trained
to
see
that
a
large
banking
reserve
is
necessary
and
to
understand
that
in
the
curious
constitution
of
the
english
banking
world
the
bank
of
england
is
the
only
body
which
could
effectually
keep
it
they
have
never
acknowledged
the
duty
some
of
them
as
we
have
seen
deny
the
duty
still
they
have
to
a
considerable
extent
begun
to
perform
the
duty
the
bank
directors
being
experienced
and
able
men
of
business
comprehended
this
like
other
men
of
business
since
they
have
always
kept
i
do
not
say
a
sufficient
banking
reserve
but
a
fair
and
creditable
banking
reserve
and
one
altogether
different
from
any
which
they
kept
before
at
one
period
the
bank
directors
even
went
farther
they
made
a
distinct
step
in
advance
of
the
public
intelligence
they
adopted
a
particular
mode
of
raising
the
rate
of
interest
which
is
far
more
efficient
than
any
other
mode
goschen
observes
in
his
book
on
the
exchanges
the
rates
in
london
and
paris
the
expense
of
sending
gold
to
and
fro
having
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
between
the
two
cities
the
difference
can
never
be
very
great
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
interest
being
taken
at
a
percentage
calculated
per
annum
and
the
probable
profit
having
when
an
operation
in
bills
is
contemplated
to
be
divided
by
four
whereas
the
percentage
of
expense
has
to
be
wholly
borne
by
the
one
transaction
a
very
slight
expense
becomes
a
great
impediment
if
the
cost
is
only
per
cent
there
must
be
a
profit
of
per
cent
in
the
rate
of
interest
or
per
cent
on
three
months
before
any
advantage
commences
and
thus
supposing
that
paris
capitalists
calculate
that
they
may
send
their
gold
over
to
england
for
per
cent
expense
and
chance
their
being
so
favoured
by
the
exchanges
as
to
be
able
to
draw
it
back
without
any
cost
at
all
there
must
nevertheless
be
an
excess
of
more
than
per
cent
in
the
london
rate
of
interest
over
that
in
paris
before
the
operation
of
sending
gold
over
from
france
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
higher
interest
will
pay
accordingly
goschen
recommended
that
the
bank
of
england
should
as
a
rule
raise
their
rate
by
steps
of
per
cent
at
a
time
when
the
object
of
the
rise
was
to
affect
the
exchanges
and
the
bank
of
england
from
onward
have
acted
upon
that
principle
before
that
time
they
used
to
raise
their
rate
almost
always
by
steps
of
per
cent
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
general
state
of
mercantile
opinion
to
compel
them
to
change
their
policy
the
change
was
on
the
contrary
most
unpopular
on
this
occasion
and
as
far
as
i
know
on
this
occasion
alone
the
bank
of
england
made
an
excellent
alteration
of
their
policy
which
was
not
exacted
by
contemporary
opinion
and
which
was
in
advance
of
it
the
beneficial
results
of
the
improved
policy
of
the
bank
were
palpable
and
speedy
we
were
enabled
by
it
to
sustain
the
great
drain
of
silver
from
europe
to
india
to
pay
for
indian
cotton
in
the
years
between
in
the
autumn
of
there
was
especial
danger
but
by
a
rapid
and
able
use
of
their
new
policy
the
bank
of
england
maintained
an
adequate
reserve
and
preserved
the
country
from
calamities
which
if
we
had
looked
only
to
precedent
would
have
seemed
inevitable
all
the
causes
which
produced
the
panic
of
were
in
action
in
the
drain
of
silver
in
and
the
preceding
year
was
beyond
comparison
greater
than
in
and
the
years
before
it
and
yet
in
there
was
no
panic
the
bank
of
england
was
almost
immediately
rewarded
for
its
adoption
of
right
principles
by
finding
that
those
principles
at
a
severe
crisis
preserved
public
credit
in
undoubtedly
a
panic
occurred
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
bank
of
england
can
be
blamed
for
it
they
had
in
their
till
an
exceedingly
good
reserve
according
to
the
estimate
of
that
time
a
sufficient
reserve
in
all
probability
to
have
coped
with
the
crises
of
and
the
suspension
of
overend
and
gurney
the
most
trusted
private
firm
in
england
caused
an
alarm
in
suddenness
and
magnitude
without
example
what
was
the
effect
of
the
act
of
on
the
panic
of
is
a
question
on
which
opinion
will
be
long
divided
but
i
think
it
will
be
generally
agreed
that
acting
under
the
provisions
of
that
law
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
had
in
their
banking
department
in
that
year
a
fairly
large
reserve
quite
as
large
a
reserve
as
anyone
expected
them
to
keep
to
meet
unexpected
and
painful
contingencies
from
to
there
was
almost
an
unbroken
calm
on
the
money
market
the
bank
of
england
had
no
difficulties
to
cope
with
there
was
no
opportunity
for
much
discretion
the
money
market
took
care
of
itself
but
in
the
bank
of
france
suspended
specie
payments
and
from
that
time
a
new
era
begins
the
demands
on
this
market
for
bullion
have
been
greater
and
have
been
more
incessant
than
they
ever
were
before
for
this
is
now
the
only
bullion
market
this
has
made
it
necessary
for
the
bank
of
england
to
hold
a
much
larger
banking
reserve
than
was
ever
before
required
and
to
be
much
more
watchful
than
in
former
times
lest
that
banking
reserve
should
on
a
sudden
be
dangerously
diminished
the
forces
are
greater
and
quicker
than
they
used
to
be
and
a
firmer
protection
and
a
surer
solicitude
are
necessary
but
i
do
not
think
the
bank
of
england
is
sufficiently
aware
of
this
all
the
governing
body
of
the
bank
certainly
are
not
aware
of
it
the
same
eminent
director
to
whom
i
have
before
referred
hankey
published
in
the
an
elaborate
letter
saying
again
that
of
the
liabilities
were
even
in
these
altered
times
a
sufficient
reserve
for
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
and
that
it
was
no
part
of
the
business
of
the
bank
to
keep
a
supply
of
for
exportation
which
was
exactly
the
most
mischievous
doctrine
that
could
be
maintained
when
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
had
become
the
only
great
repository
in
europe
where
gold
could
at
once
be
obtained
and
when
therefore
a
far
greater
store
of
bullion
ought
to
be
kept
than
at
any
former
period
and
besides
this
defect
of
the
present
time
there
are
some
chronic
faults
in
the
policy
of
the
bank
of
england
which
arise
as
will
be
presently
explained
from
grave
defects
in
its
form
of
government
there
is
almost
always
some
hesitation
when
a
governor
begins
to
reign
he
is
the
prime
minister
of
the
bank
cabinet
and
when
so
important
a
functionary
changes
naturally
much
else
changes
too
if
the
governor
be
weak
this
kind
of
vacillation
and
hesitation
continues
throughout
his
term
of
office
the
usual
defect
then
is
that
the
bank
of
england
does
not
raise
the
rate
of
interest
sufficiently
quickly
it
does
raise
it
in
the
end
it
takes
the
alarm
but
it
does
not
take
the
alarm
sufficiently
soon
a
cautious
man
in
a
new
office
does
not
like
strong
measures
bank
governors
are
generally
cautious
men
they
are
taken
from
a
most
cautious
class
in
consequence
they
are
very
apt
to
temporise
and
delay
but
almost
always
the
delay
in
creating
a
stringency
only
makes
a
greater
stringency
inevitable
the
effect
of
a
timid
policy
has
been
to
let
the
gold
out
of
the
bank
and
that
gold
must
be
recovered
it
would
really
have
been
far
easier
to
have
maintained
the
reserve
by
timely
measures
than
to
have
replenished
it
by
delayed
measures
but
new
governors
rarely
see
this
secondly
those
defects
are
apt
in
part
or
as
a
whole
to
be
continued
throughout
the
reign
of
a
weak
governor
the
objection
to
a
decided
policy
and
the
indisposition
to
a
timely
action
which
are
excusable
in
one
whose
influence
is
beginning
and
whose
reign
is
new
is
continued
through
the
whole
reign
of
one
to
whom
those
defects
are
natural
and
who
exhibits
those
defects
in
all
his
affairs
thirdly
this
defect
is
enhanced
because
as
has
so
often
been
said
there
is
now
no
adequate
rule
recognised
in
the
management
of
the
banking
reserve
weguelin
the
last
bank
governor
who
has
been
examined
said
that
it
was
sufficient
for
the
bank
to
keep
from
to
of
its
banking
liabilities
as
a
reserve
but
no
one
now
would
ever
be
content
if
the
banking
reserve
were
near
to
of
its
liabilities
hankey
as
i
have
shown
considers
a
third
as
the
proportion
of
reserve
to
liability
at
which
the
bank
should
aim
but
he
does
not
say
whether
he
regards
a
third
as
the
minimum
below
which
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
should
never
be
or
as
a
fair
average
about
which
the
reserve
may
fluctuate
sometimes
being
greater
or
at
others
less
in
a
future
chapter
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
that
of
its
banking
liabilities
is
at
present
by
no
means
an
adequate
reserve
for
the
banking
department
that
it
is
not
even
a
proper
minimum
far
less
a
fair
average
and
i
shall
allege
what
seem
to
me
good
reasons
for
thinking
that
unless
the
bank
aim
by
a
different
method
at
a
higher
standard
its
own
position
may
hereafter
be
perilous
and
the
public
may
be
exposed
to
disaster
ii
but
as
has
been
explained
the
bank
of
england
is
bound
according
to
our
system
not
only
to
keep
a
good
reserve
against
a
time
of
panic
but
to
use
that
reserve
effectually
when
that
time
of
panic
comes
the
keepers
of
the
banking
reserve
whether
one
or
many
are
obliged
then
to
use
that
reserve
for
their
own
safety
if
they
permit
all
other
forms
of
credit
to
perish
their
own
will
perish
immediately
and
in
consequence
as
to
the
bank
of
england
however
this
is
denied
it
is
alleged
that
the
bank
of
england
can
keep
aloof
in
a
panic
that
it
can
if
it
will
let
other
banks
and
trades
fail
that
if
it
chooses
it
can
stand
alone
and
survive
intact
while
all
else
perishes
around
it
on
various
occasions
most
influential
persons
both
in
the
government
of
the
bank
and
out
of
it
have
said
that
such
was
their
opinion
and
we
must
at
once
see
whether
this
opinion
is
true
or
false
for
it
is
absurd
to
attempt
to
estimate
the
conduct
of
the
bank
of
england
during
panics
before
we
know
what
the
precise
position
of
the
bank
in
a
panic
really
is
the
holders
of
this
opinion
in
its
most
extreme
form
say
that
in
a
panic
the
bank
of
england
can
stay
its
hand
at
any
time
that
though
it
has
advanced
much
it
may
refuse
to
advance
more
that
though
the
reserve
may
have
been
reduced
by
such
advances
it
may
refuse
to
lessen
it
still
further
that
it
can
refuse
to
make
any
further
dis
counts
that
the
bills
which
it
has
discounted
will
become
due
that
it
can
refill
its
reserve
by
the
payment
of
those
bills
that
it
can
sell
stock
or
other
securities
and
so
replenish
its
reserve
still
further
but
in
this
form
the
notion
scarcely
merits
serious
refutation
if
the
bank
reserve
has
once
become
low
there
are
in
a
panic
no
means
of
raising
it
again
money
parted
with
at
such
a
time
is
very
hard
to
get
back
those
who
have
taken
it
will
not
let
it
go
not
at
least
unless
they
are
sure
of
getting
other
money
in
its
place
and
at
such
instant
the
recovery
of
money
is
as
hard
for
the
bank
of
england
as
for
any
one
else
probably
even
harder
the
difficulty
is
this
if
the
bank
decline
to
discount
the
holders
of
the
bills
previously
discounted
can
not
pay
as
has
been
shown
trade
in
england
is
largely
carried
on
with
borrowed
money
if
you
propose
greatly
to
reduce
that
amount
you
will
cause
many
failures
unless
you
can
pour
in
from
elsewhere
some
equivalent
amount
of
new
money
but
in
a
panic
there
is
no
new
money
to
be
had
everybody
who
has
it
clings
to
it
and
will
not
part
with
it
especially
what
has
been
advanced
to
merchants
can
not
easily
be
recovered
they
are
under
immense
liabilities
and
they
will
not
give
back
a
penny
which
they
imagine
that
even
possibly
they
may
need
to
discharge
those
liabilities
and
bankers
are
in
even
greater
terror
in
a
panic
they
will
not
discount
a
host
of
new
bills
they
are
engrossed
with
their
own
liabilities
and
those
of
their
own
customers
and
do
not
care
for
those
of
others
the
notion
that
the
bank
of
england
can
stop
discounting
in
a
panic
and
so
obtain
fresh
money
is
a
delusion
it
can
stop
discounting
of
course
at
pleasure
but
if
it
does
it
will
get
in
no
new
money
its
bill
case
will
daily
be
more
and
more
packed
with
bills
unpaid
the
sale
of
stock
too
by
the
bank
of
england
in
the
middle
of
a
panic
is
impossible
the
bank
at
such
a
time
is
the
only
lender
on
stock
and
it
is
only
by
loans
from
a
bank
that
large
purchases
at
such
a
moment
can
be
made
unless
the
bank
of
england
lend
no
stock
will
be
bought
there
is
not
in
the
country
any
large
sum
of
unused
ready
money
ready
to
buy
it
the
only
unused
sum
is
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
if
therefore
in
a
panic
that
department
itself
attempt
to
sell
stock
the
failure
would
be
ridiculous
it
would
hardly
be
able
to
sell
any
at
all
probably
it
would
not
sell
fifty
pounds
worth
the
idea
that
the
bank
can
during
a
panic
replenish
its
reserve
in
this
or
in
any
other
manner
when
that
reserve
has
once
been
allowed
to
become
empty
or
nearly
empty
is
too
absurd
to
be
steadily
maintained
though
i
fear
that
it
is
not
yet
wholly
abandoned
the
second
and
more
reasonable
conception
of
the
independence
of
the
bank
of
england
is
however
this
it
may
be
said
and
it
is
said
that
if
the
bank
of
england
stop
at
the
beginning
of
a
panic
if
it
refuse
to
advance
a
shilling
more
than
usual
if
it
begin
the
battle
with
a
good
banking
reserve
and
do
not
diminish
it
by
extra
loans
the
bank
of
england
is
sure
to
be
safe
but
this
form
of
the
opinion
though
more
reasonable
and
moderate
is
not
therefore
more
true
the
panic
of
is
the
best
instance
to
test
it
as
everyone
knows
that
panic
began
quite
suddenly
on
the
fall
of
just
before
the
bank
had
in
its
reserve
in
fact
it
advanced
of
new
money
in
the
next
few
days
and
its
reserve
went
down
to
nothing
and
the
government
had
to
help
but
if
the
bank
had
not
made
these
advances
could
it
have
kept
its
reserve
certainly
it
could
not
it
could
not
have
retained
its
own
deposits
a
large
part
of
these
are
the
deposits
of
bankers
and
they
would
not
consent
to
help
the
bank
of
england
in
a
policy
of
isolation
they
would
not
agree
to
suspend
payments
themselves
and
permit
the
bank
of
england
to
survive
and
get
all
their
business
they
would
withdraw
their
deposits
from
the
bank
they
would
not
assist
it
to
stand
erect
amid
their
ruin
but
even
if
this
were
not
so
even
if
the
banks
were
willing
to
keep
their
deposits
at
the
bank
while
it
was
not
lending
they
would
soon
find
that
they
could
not
do
it
they
are
only
able
to
keep
those
deposits
at
the
bank
by
the
aid
of
the
system
and
if
a
panic
were
to
pass
a
certain
height
that
system
which
rests
on
confidence
would
be
destroyed
by
terror
the
common
course
of
business
is
this
a
b
having
to
receive
from
c
d
takes
c
d
cheque
on
a
banker
crossed
as
it
is
called
and
therefore
only
payable
to
another
banker
he
pays
that
cheque
to
his
own
credit
with
his
own
banker
who
presents
it
to
the
banker
on
whom
it
is
drawn
and
if
good
it
is
an
item
between
them
in
the
general
clearing
or
settlement
of
the
afternoon
but
this
is
evidently
a
very
refined
machinery
which
a
panic
will
be
apt
to
destroy
at
the
first
stage
a
b
may
say
to
his
debtor
c
d
can
not
take
your
cheque
i
must
have
if
it
is
a
debt
on
securities
he
will
be
very
apt
to
say
this
the
usual
practice
credit
being
good
is
for
the
creditor
to
take
the
cheque
and
to
give
up
the
securities
but
if
the
really
secure
him
in
a
time
of
difficulty
he
will
not
like
to
give
them
up
and
take
a
bit
of
paper
a
mere
cheque
which
may
be
paid
or
not
paid
he
will
say
to
his
debtor
can
only
give
you
your
securities
if
you
will
give
me
and
if
he
does
say
so
the
debtor
must
go
to
his
bank
and
draw
out
the
if
he
has
it
but
if
this
were
done
on
a
large
scale
the
bank
in
house
would
soon
be
gone
as
the
was
gradually
superseded
it
would
have
to
trench
on
its
deposit
at
the
bank
of
england
and
then
the
bankers
would
have
to
pay
so
much
over
the
counter
that
they
would
be
unable
to
keep
much
money
at
the
bank
even
if
they
wished
they
would
soon
be
obliged
to
draw
out
every
shilling
the
diminished
use
of
the
in
consequence
of
the
panic
would
intensify
that
panic
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
bargains
of
the
country
in
moneyed
securities
is
settled
on
the
stock
exchange
twice
a
month
and
the
number
of
securities
then
given
up
for
mere
cheques
and
the
number
of
cheques
then
passing
at
the
are
enormous
if
that
system
collapse
the
number
of
failures
would
be
incalculable
and
each
failure
would
add
to
the
discredit
that
caused
the
collapse
the
customers
of
the
bank
of
england
would
be
discredited
as
well
as
other
people
their
cheques
would
not
be
taken
any
more
than
those
of
others
they
would
have
to
draw
out
and
the
bank
reserve
would
not
be
enough
for
a
tithe
of
such
payments
the
matter
would
come
shortly
to
this
a
great
number
of
brokers
and
dealers
are
under
obligations
to
pay
immense
sums
and
in
common
times
they
obtain
these
sums
by
the
transfer
of
certain
securities
if
as
we
said
just
now
no
has
borrowed
of
no
on
exchequer
bills
he
for
the
most
part
can
not
pay
no
till
he
has
sold
or
pledged
those
bills
to
some
one
else
but
till
he
has
the
bills
he
can
not
pledge
or
sell
them
and
if
no
will
not
give
them
up
till
he
gets
his
money
no
will
be
ruined
because
he
can
not
pay
it
and
if
no
has
no
to
pay
as
is
very
likely
he
may
be
ruined
because
of
no
default
and
no
only
on
account
of
no
default
and
so
on
without
end
on
settling
day
without
the
there
would
be
a
mass
of
failures
and
a
bundle
of
securities
the
effect
of
these
failures
would
be
a
general
run
on
all
bankers
and
on
the
bank
of
england
particularly
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
the
money
thus
taken
from
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
would
return
there
immediately
that
the
public
who
borrowed
it
would
not
know
where
else
to
deposit
it
that
it
would
be
taken
out
in
the
morning
and
put
back
in
the
evening
but
in
the
first
place
this
argument
assumes
that
the
banking
department
would
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
demands
on
it
and
this
is
a
mistake
the
banking
department
would
not
have
a
hundredth
part
of
the
necessary
funds
and
in
the
second
a
great
panic
which
deranged
the
would
soon
be
diffused
all
through
the
country
the
money
therefore
taken
from
the
bank
of
england
could
not
be
soon
returned
to
the
bank
it
would
not
come
back
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
it
was
taken
out
or
for
many
days
it
would
be
distributed
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
wherever
there
were
bankers
wherever
there
was
trade
wherever
there
were
liabilities
wherever
there
was
terror
and
even
in
london
so
immense
a
panic
would
soon
impair
the
credit
of
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
that
department
has
no
great
prestige
it
was
only
created
in
and
it
has
failed
three
times
since
the
world
would
imagine
that
what
has
happened
before
will
happen
again
and
when
they
have
got
money
they
will
not
deposit
it
at
an
establishment
which
may
not
be
able
to
repay
it
this
did
not
happen
in
former
panics
because
the
case
we
are
considering
never
arose
the
bank
was
helping
the
public
and
more
or
less
confidently
it
was
believed
that
the
government
would
help
the
bank
but
if
the
policy
be
relinquished
which
formerly
assuaged
alarm
that
alarm
will
be
protracted
and
enhanced
till
it
touch
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
itself
i
do
not
imagine
that
it
would
touch
the
issue
department
i
think
that
the
public
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
they
obtained
generally
nothing
is
gained
by
holding
the
notes
of
a
bank
instead
of
depositing
them
at
a
bank
but
in
the
bank
of
england
there
is
a
great
difference
their
notes
are
legal
tender
whoever
holds
them
can
always
pay
his
debts
and
except
for
foreign
payments
he
could
want
no
more
the
rush
would
be
for
those
that
could
be
obtained
would
be
carried
north
south
east
and
west
and
as
there
would
not
be
enough
for
all
the
country
the
banking
department
would
soon
pay
away
all
it
had
nothing
therefore
can
be
more
certain
than
that
the
bank
of
england
has
in
this
respect
no
peculiar
privilege
that
it
is
simply
in
the
position
of
a
bank
keeping
the
banking
reserve
of
the
country
that
it
must
in
time
of
panic
do
what
all
other
similar
banks
must
do
that
in
time
of
panic
it
must
advance
freely
and
vigorously
to
the
public
out
of
the
reserve
and
with
the
bank
of
england
as
with
other
banks
in
the
same
case
these
advances
if
they
are
to
be
made
at
all
should
be
made
so
as
if
possible
to
obtain
the
object
for
which
they
are
made
the
end
is
to
stay
the
panic
and
the
advances
should
if
possible
stay
the
panic
and
for
this
purpose
there
are
two
rules
first
that
these
loans
should
only
be
made
at
a
very
high
rate
of
interest
this
will
operate
as
a
heavy
fine
on
unreasonable
timidity
and
will
prevent
the
greatest
number
of
applications
by
persons
who
do
not
require
it
the
rate
should
be
raised
early
in
the
panic
so
that
the
fine
may
be
paid
early
that
no
one
may
borrow
out
of
idle
precaution
without
paying
well
for
it
that
the
banking
reserve
may
be
protected
as
far
as
possible
secondly
that
at
this
rate
these
advances
should
be
made
on
all
good
banking
securities
and
as
largely
as
the
public
ask
for
them
the
reason
is
plain
the
object
is
to
stay
alarm
and
nothing
therefore
should
be
done
to
cause
alarm
but
the
way
to
cause
alarm
is
to
refuse
some
one
who
has
good
security
to
offer
the
news
of
this
will
spread
in
an
instant
through
all
the
money
market
at
a
moment
of
terror
no
one
can
say
exactly
who
carries
it
but
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
carried
on
all
sides
and
will
intensify
the
terror
everywhere
no
advances
indeed
need
be
made
by
which
the
bank
will
ultimately
lose
the
amount
of
bad
business
in
commercial
countries
is
an
infinitesimally
small
fraction
of
the
whole
business
that
in
a
panic
the
bank
or
banks
holding
the
ultimate
reserve
should
refuse
bad
bills
or
bad
securities
will
not
make
the
panic
really
worse
the
people
are
a
feeble
minority
and
they
are
afraid
even
to
look
frightened
for
fear
their
unsoundness
may
be
detected
the
great
majority
the
majority
to
be
protected
are
the
people
the
people
who
have
good
security
to
offer
if
it
is
known
that
the
bank
of
england
is
freely
advancing
on
what
in
ordinary
times
is
reckoned
a
good
security
on
what
is
then
commonly
pledged
and
easily
convertible
the
alarm
of
the
solvent
merchants
and
bankers
will
be
stayed
but
if
securities
really
good
and
usually
convertible
are
refused
by
the
bank
the
alarm
will
not
abate
the
other
loans
made
will
fail
in
obtaining
their
end
and
the
panic
will
become
worse
and
worse
it
may
be
said
that
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
will
not
be
enough
for
all
such
loans
if
that
be
so
the
banking
department
must
fail
but
lending
is
nevertheless
its
best
expedient
this
is
the
method
of
making
its
money
go
the
farthest
and
of
enabling
it
to
get
through
the
panic
if
anything
will
so
enable
it
making
no
loans
as
we
have
seen
will
ruin
it
making
large
loans
and
stopping
as
we
have
also
seen
will
ruin
it
the
only
safe
plan
for
the
bank
is
the
brave
plan
to
lend
in
a
panic
on
every
kind
of
current
security
or
every
sort
on
which
money
is
ordinarily
and
usually
lent
this
policy
may
not
save
the
bank
but
if
it
do
not
nothing
will
save
it
if
we
examine
the
manner
in
which
the
bank
of
england
has
fulfilled
these
duties
we
shall
find
as
we
found
before
that
the
true
principle
has
never
been
grasped
that
the
policy
has
been
inconsistent
that
though
the
policy
has
much
improved
there
still
remain
important
particulars
in
which
it
might
be
better
than
it
is
the
first
panic
of
which
it
is
necessary
here
to
speak
is
that
of
i
hardly
think
we
should
derive
much
instruction
from
those
of
and
the
world
has
changed
too
much
since
and
during
the
long
period
of
inconvertible
currency
from
to
the
problems
to
be
solved
were
altogether
different
from
our
present
ones
in
the
panic
of
the
bank
of
england
at
first
acted
as
unwisely
as
it
was
possible
to
act
by
every
means
it
tried
to
restrict
its
advances
the
reserve
being
very
small
it
endeavoured
to
protect
that
reserve
by
lending
as
little
as
possible
the
result
was
a
period
of
frantic
and
almost
inconceivable
violence
scarcely
any
one
knew
whom
to
trust
credit
was
almost
suspended
the
country
was
as
huskisson
expressed
it
within
hours
of
a
state
of
barter
applications
for
assistance
were
made
to
the
government
but
though
it
was
well
known
that
the
government
refused
to
act
there
was
not
as
far
as
i
know
until
lately
any
authentic
narrative
of
the
real
facts
in
the
of
the
duke
of
wellington
of
all
places
in
the
world
there
is
a
full
account
of
them
the
duke
was
then
on
a
mission
at
petersburg
and
sir
peel
wrote
to
him
a
letter
of
which
the
following
is
a
part
have
been
placed
in
a
very
unpleasant
predicament
on
the
other
question
the
issue
of
exchequer
bills
by
government
the
feeling
of
the
city
of
many
of
our
friends
of
some
of
the
opposition
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
issue
of
exchequer
bills
to
relieve
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
was
said
in
favour
of
the
issue
that
the
same
measure
had
been
tried
and
succeeded
in
and
our
friends
whispered
about
that
we
were
acting
quite
in
a
different
manner
from
that
in
which
pitt
did
act
and
would
have
acted
had
he
been
alive
felt
satisfied
that
however
plausible
were
the
reasons
urged
in
favour
of
the
issue
of
exchequer
bills
yet
that
the
measure
was
a
dangerous
one
and
ought
to
be
resisted
by
the
government
are
thirty
millions
of
exchequer
bills
outstanding
the
purchases
lately
made
by
the
bank
can
hardly
maintain
them
at
par
if
there
were
a
new
issue
to
such
an
amount
as
that
contemplated
five
millions
there
would
be
a
great
danger
that
the
whole
mass
of
exchequer
bills
would
be
at
a
discount
and
would
be
paid
into
the
revenue
if
the
new
exchequer
bills
were
to
be
issued
at
a
different
rate
of
interest
from
the
outstanding
ones
say
bearing
an
interest
of
five
per
cent
the
old
ones
would
be
immediately
at
a
great
discount
unless
the
interest
were
raised
if
the
interest
were
raised
the
charge
on
the
revenue
would
be
of
course
proportionate
to
the
increase
of
rate
of
interest
we
found
that
the
bank
had
the
power
to
lend
money
on
deposit
of
goods
as
our
issue
of
exchequer
bills
would
have
been
useless
unless
the
bank
cashed
them
as
therefore
the
intervention
of
the
bank
was
in
any
event
absolutely
necessary
and
as
its
intervention
would
be
chiefly
useful
by
the
effect
which
it
would
have
in
increasing
the
circulating
medium
we
advised
the
bank
to
take
the
whole
affair
into
their
own
hands
at
once
to
issue
their
notes
on
the
security
of
goods
instead
of
issuing
them
on
exchequer
bills
such
bills
being
themselves
issued
on
that
security
reluctantly
consented
and
rescued
us
from
a
very
embarrassing
predicament
the
success
of
the
bank
of
england
on
this
occasion
was
owing
to
its
complete
adoption
of
right
principles
the
bank
adopted
these
principles
very
late
but
when
it
adopted
them
it
adopted
them
completely
according
to
the
official
statement
which
i
quoted
before
that
is
the
bank
directors
money
by
every
possible
means
and
in
modes
which
we
had
never
adopted
before
we
took
in
stock
on
security
we
purchased
exchequer
bills
we
made
advances
on
exchequer
bills
we
not
only
discounted
outright
but
we
made
advances
on
deposits
of
bills
of
exchange
to
an
immense
amount
in
short
by
every
possible
means
consistent
with
the
safety
of
the
bank
and
for
the
complete
and
courageous
adoption
of
this
policy
at
the
last
moment
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
at
that
time
deserve
great
praise
for
the
subject
was
then
less
understood
even
than
it
is
now
but
the
directors
of
the
bank
deserve
also
severe
censure
for
previously
choosing
a
contrary
policy
for
being
reluctant
to
adopt
the
new
one
and
for
at
last
adopting
it
only
at
the
request
of
and
upon
a
joint
responsibility
with
the
executive
government
after
there
was
not
again
a
real
panic
in
the
money
market
till
both
of
the
crises
of
and
were
severe
but
neither
terminated
in
a
panic
both
were
arrested
before
the
alarm
reached
its
final
intensity
in
neither
therefore
could
the
policy
of
the
bank
at
the
last
stage
of
fear
be
tested
in
the
three
panics
since
in
and
the
policy
of
the
bank
has
been
more
or
less
affected
by
the
act
of
and
i
can
not
therefore
discuss
it
fully
within
the
limits
which
i
have
pre
scribed
for
myself
i
can
only
state
two
things
first
that
the
directors
of
the
bank
above
all
things
maintain
that
they
have
not
been
in
the
earlier
stage
of
panic
prevented
by
the
act
of
from
making
any
advances
which
they
would
otherwise
have
then
made
secondly
that
in
the
last
stage
of
panic
the
act
of
has
been
already
suspended
rightly
or
wrongly
on
these
occasions
that
no
similar
occasion
has
ever
yet
occurred
in
which
it
has
not
been
suspended
and
that
rightly
or
wrongly
the
world
confidently
expects
and
relies
that
in
all
similar
cases
it
will
be
suspended
again
whatever
theory
may
prescribe
the
logic
of
facts
seems
peremptory
so
far
and
these
principles
taken
together
amount
to
saying
that
by
the
doctrine
of
the
directors
the
bank
of
england
ought
as
far
as
they
can
to
manage
a
panic
with
the
act
of
pretty
much
as
they
would
manage
one
without
it
in
the
early
stage
of
the
panic
because
then
they
are
not
fettered
and
in
the
latter
because
then
the
fetter
has
been
removed
we
can
therefore
estimate
the
policy
of
the
bank
of
england
in
the
three
panics
which
have
happened
since
the
act
of
without
inquiring
into
the
effect
of
the
act
itself
it
is
certain
that
in
all
of
these
panics
the
bank
has
made
very
large
advances
indeed
it
is
certain
too
that
in
all
of
them
the
bank
has
been
quicker
than
it
was
in
that
in
all
of
them
it
has
less
hesitated
to
use
its
banking
reserve
in
making
the
advances
which
it
is
one
principal
object
of
maintaining
that
reserve
to
make
and
to
make
at
once
but
there
is
still
a
considerable
evil
no
one
knows
on
what
kind
of
securities
the
bank
of
england
will
at
such
periods
make
the
advances
which
it
is
necessary
to
make
as
we
have
seen
principle
requires
that
such
advances
if
made
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
curing
panic
should
be
made
in
the
manner
most
likely
to
cure
that
panic
and
for
this
purpose
they
should
be
made
on
everything
which
in
common
times
is
good
security
the
evil
is
that
owing
to
terror
what
is
commonly
good
security
has
ceased
to
be
so
and
the
true
policy
is
so
to
use
the
banking
reserve
that
if
possible
the
temporary
evil
may
be
stayed
and
the
common
course
of
business
be
restored
and
this
can
only
be
effected
by
advancing
on
all
good
banking
securities
unfortunately
the
bank
of
england
do
not
take
this
course
the
discount
office
is
open
for
the
discount
of
good
bills
and
makes
immense
advances
accordingly
the
bank
also
advances
on
consols
and
india
securities
though
there
was
in
the
crisis
of
believed
to
be
for
a
moment
a
hesitation
in
so
doing
but
these
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
securities
on
which
money
in
ordinary
times
can
be
readily
obtained
and
by
which
its
repayment
is
fully
secured
railway
debenture
stock
is
as
good
a
security
as
a
commercial
bill
and
many
people
of
whom
i
own
i
am
one
think
it
safer
than
india
stock
on
the
whole
a
great
railway
is
we
think
less
liable
to
unforeseen
accidents
than
the
strange
empire
of
india
but
i
doubt
if
the
bank
of
england
in
a
panic
would
advance
on
railway
debenture
stock
at
any
rate
no
one
has
any
authorised
reason
for
saying
that
it
would
and
there
are
many
other
such
securities
the
amount
of
the
advance
is
the
main
consideration
for
the
bank
of
england
and
not
the
nature
of
the
security
on
which
the
advance
is
made
always
assuming
the
security
to
be
good
an
idea
prevails
as
i
believe
at
the
bank
of
england
that
they
ought
not
to
advance
during
a
panic
on
any
kind
of
security
on
which
they
do
not
commonly
advance
but
if
bankers
for
the
most
part
do
advance
on
such
security
in
common
times
and
if
that
security
is
indisputably
good
the
ordinary
practice
of
the
bank
of
england
is
immaterial
in
ordinary
times
the
bank
is
only
one
of
many
lenders
whereas
in
a
panic
it
is
the
sole
lender
and
we
want
as
far
as
we
can
to
bring
back
the
unusual
state
of
a
time
of
panic
to
the
common
state
of
ordinary
times
in
common
opinion
there
is
always
great
uncertainty
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
bank
the
bank
has
never
laid
down
any
clear
and
sound
policy
on
the
subject
as
we
have
seen
some
of
its
directors
like
hankey
advocate
an
erroneous
policy
the
public
is
never
sure
what
policy
will
be
adopted
at
the
most
important
moment
it
is
not
sure
what
amount
of
advance
will
be
made
or
on
what
security
it
will
be
made
the
best
palliative
to
a
panic
is
a
confidence
in
the
adequate
amount
of
the
bank
reserve
and
in
the
efficient
use
of
that
reserve
and
until
we
have
on
this
point
a
clear
understanding
with
the
bank
of
england
both
our
liability
to
crises
and
our
terror
at
crises
will
always
be
greater
than
they
would
otherwise
be
chapter
viii
the
government
of
the
bank
of
england
the
bank
of
england
is
governed
by
a
board
of
directors
a
governor
and
a
and
the
mode
in
which
these
are
chosen
and
the
time
for
which
they
hold
office
affect
the
whole
of
its
business
the
board
of
directors
is
in
fact
in
theory
a
certain
portion
go
out
annually
remain
out
for
a
year
and
are
subject
to
by
the
proprietors
but
in
fact
they
are
nearly
always
and
always
if
the
other
directors
wish
it
after
a
year
such
has
been
the
unbroken
practice
of
many
years
and
it
would
be
hardly
possible
now
to
break
it
when
a
vacancy
occurs
by
death
or
resignation
the
whole
board
chooses
the
new
member
and
they
do
it
as
i
am
told
with
great
care
for
a
peculiar
reason
it
is
important
that
the
directors
should
be
young
when
they
begin
and
accordingly
the
board
run
over
the
names
of
the
most
attentive
and
promising
young
men
in
the
firms
of
london
and
select
the
one
who
they
think
will
be
most
suitable
for
a
bank
director
there
is
a
considerable
ambition
to
fill
the
office
the
status
which
is
given
by
it
both
to
the
individual
who
fills
it
and
to
the
firm
of
merchants
to
which
he
belongs
is
considerable
there
is
surprisingly
little
favour
shown
in
the
selection
there
is
a
great
wish
on
the
part
of
the
bank
directors
for
the
time
being
to
provide
to
the
best
of
their
ability
for
the
future
good
government
of
the
bank
very
few
selections
in
the
world
are
made
with
nearly
equal
purity
there
is
a
sincere
desire
to
do
the
best
for
the
bank
and
to
appoint
a
young
man
who
has
begun
to
attend
to
business
and
who
seems
likely
to
be
fairly
sensible
and
fairly
efficient
twenty
years
later
the
age
is
a
primary
matter
the
offices
of
governor
and
are
given
in
rotation
the
always
succeeds
the
governor
and
usually
the
oldest
director
who
has
not
been
in
office
becomes
sometimes
from
personal
reasons
such
as
or
special
temporary
occupation
the
time
at
which
a
director
becomes
may
be
a
little
deferred
and
in
some
few
cases
merchants
in
the
greatest
business
have
been
permitted
to
decline
entirely
but
for
all
general
purposes
the
rule
may
be
taken
as
absolute
save
in
rare
cases
a
director
must
serve
his
time
as
governor
and
nearly
when
his
turn
comes
and
he
will
not
be
asked
to
serve
much
before
his
turn
it
is
usually
about
twenty
years
from
the
time
of
a
first
election
that
he
arrives
as
it
is
called
at
the
chair
and
as
the
offices
of
governor
and
are
very
important
a
man
who
fills
them
should
be
still
in
the
vigour
of
life
accordingly
bank
directors
when
first
chosen
by
the
board
are
always
young
men
at
first
this
has
rather
a
singular
effect
a
stranger
hardly
knows
what
to
make
of
it
many
years
since
i
remember
seeing
a
very
fresh
and
young
gentleman
and
being
struck
with
astonishment
at
being
told
that
he
was
a
director
of
the
bank
of
england
i
had
always
imagined
such
directors
to
be
men
of
tried
sagacity
and
long
experience
and
i
was
amazed
that
a
cheerful
young
man
should
be
one
of
them
i
believe
i
thought
it
was
a
little
dangerous
i
thought
such
young
men
could
not
manage
the
bank
well
i
feared
they
had
the
power
to
do
mischief
further
inquiry
however
soon
convinced
me
that
they
had
not
the
power
naturally
young
men
have
not
much
influence
at
a
board
where
there
are
many
older
members
and
in
the
bank
of
england
there
is
a
special
provision
for
depriving
them
of
it
if
they
get
it
some
of
the
directors
as
i
have
said
retire
annually
but
by
courtesy
it
is
always
the
young
ones
those
who
have
passed
the
chair
that
is
who
have
served
the
office
of
governor
always
remain
the
young
part
of
the
board
is
the
fluctuating
part
and
the
old
part
is
the
permanent
part
and
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
young
part
has
little
influence
the
bank
directors
may
be
blamed
for
many
things
but
they
can
not
be
blamed
for
the
changeableness
and
excitability
of
a
neocracy
indeed
still
better
to
prevent
it
the
elder
members
of
the
board
that
is
those
who
have
passed
the
chair
form
a
standing
committee
of
indefinite
powers
which
is
called
the
committee
of
treasury
i
say
powers
for
i
am
not
aware
that
any
precise
description
has
ever
been
given
of
them
and
i
doubt
if
they
can
be
precisely
described
they
are
sometimes
said
to
exercise
a
particular
control
over
the
relations
and
negotiations
between
the
bank
and
the
government
but
i
confess
that
i
believe
that
this
varies
very
much
with
the
character
of
the
governor
for
the
time
being
a
strong
governor
does
much
mainly
upon
his
own
responsibility
and
a
weak
governor
does
little
still
the
influence
of
the
committee
of
treasury
is
always
considerable
though
not
always
the
same
they
form
a
a
cabinet
of
mature
declining
and
old
men
just
close
to
the
executive
and
for
good
or
evil
such
a
cabinet
must
have
much
power
by
old
usage
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
can
not
be
themselves
by
trade
bankers
this
is
a
relic
of
old
times
every
bank
was
supposed
to
be
necessarily
more
or
less
in
opposition
to
every
other
bank
banks
in
the
same
place
to
be
especially
in
opposition
in
consequence
in
london
no
banker
has
a
chance
of
being
a
bank
director
or
would
ever
think
of
attempting
to
be
one
i
am
here
speaking
of
bankers
in
the
english
sense
and
in
the
sense
that
would
surprise
a
foreigner
one
of
the
rothschilds
is
on
the
bank
direction
and
a
foreigner
would
be
apt
to
think
that
they
were
bankers
if
any
one
was
but
this
only
illustrates
the
essential
difference
between
our
english
notions
of
banking
and
the
continental
ours
have
attained
a
much
fuller
development
than
theirs
rothschild
are
immense
capitalists
having
doubtless
much
borrowed
money
in
their
hands
but
they
do
not
take
payable
on
demand
and
pay
it
back
in
cheques
of
each
and
that
is
our
english
banking
the
borrowed
money
which
they
have
is
in
large
sums
borrowed
for
terms
more
or
less
long
english
bankers
deal
with
an
aggregate
of
small
sums
all
of
which
are
repayable
on
short
notice
or
on
demand
and
the
way
the
two
employ
their
money
is
different
also
a
foreigner
thinks
exchange
business
that
is
the
buying
and
selling
bills
on
foreign
countries
a
main
part
of
banking
as
i
have
explained
remittance
is
one
of
the
subsidiary
conveniences
which
early
banks
subserve
before
deposit
banking
begins
but
the
mass
of
english
country
bankers
only
give
bills
on
places
in
england
or
on
london
and
in
london
the
principal
remittance
business
has
escaped
out
of
the
hands
of
the
bankers
most
of
them
would
not
know
how
to
carry
through
a
great
operation
or
to
home
the
returns
they
would
as
soon
think
of
turning
silk
merchants
the
exchange
trade
is
carried
on
by
a
small
and
special
body
of
foreign
of
whom
rothschild
are
the
greatest
one
of
that
firm
may
therefore
well
be
on
the
bank
direction
notwithstanding
the
rule
forbidding
bankers
to
be
there
for
he
and
his
family
are
not
english
bankers
either
by
the
terms
on
which
they
borrow
money
or
the
mode
in
which
they
employ
it
but
as
to
bankers
in
the
english
sense
of
the
word
the
rule
is
rigid
and
absolute
not
only
no
private
banker
is
a
director
of
the
bank
of
england
but
no
director
of
any
joint
stock
bank
would
be
allowed
to
become
such
the
two
situations
would
be
taken
to
be
incompatible
the
mass
of
the
bank
directors
are
merchants
of
experience
employing
a
considerable
capital
in
trades
in
which
they
have
been
brought
up
and
with
which
they
are
well
acquainted
many
of
them
have
information
as
to
the
present
course
of
trade
and
as
to
the
character
and
wealth
of
merchants
which
is
most
valuable
or
rather
is
all
but
invaluable
to
the
bank
many
of
them
too
are
quiet
serious
men
who
by
habit
and
nature
watch
with
some
kind
of
care
every
kind
of
business
in
which
they
are
engaged
and
give
an
anxious
opinion
on
it
most
of
them
have
a
good
deal
of
leisure
for
the
life
of
a
man
of
business
who
employs
only
his
own
capital
and
employs
it
nearly
always
in
the
same
way
is
by
no
means
fully
employed
hardly
any
capital
is
enough
to
employ
the
principal
partner
time
and
if
such
a
man
is
very
busy
it
is
a
sign
of
something
wrong
either
he
is
working
at
detail
which
subordinates
would
do
better
and
which
he
had
better
leave
alone
or
he
is
engaged
in
too
many
speculations
is
incurring
more
liabilities
than
his
capital
will
bear
and
so
may
be
ruined
in
consequence
every
commercial
city
abounds
in
men
who
have
great
business
ability
and
experience
who
are
not
fully
occupied
who
wish
to
be
occupied
and
who
are
very
glad
to
become
directors
of
public
companies
in
order
to
be
occupied
the
direction
of
the
bank
of
england
has
for
many
generations
been
composed
of
such
men
such
a
government
for
a
joint
stock
company
is
very
good
if
its
essential
nature
be
attended
to
and
very
bad
if
that
nature
be
not
attended
to
that
government
is
composed
of
men
with
a
high
average
of
general
good
sense
with
an
excellent
knowledge
of
business
in
general
but
without
any
special
knowledge
of
the
particular
business
in
which
they
are
engaged
ordinarily
in
joint
stock
banks
and
companies
this
deficiency
is
cured
by
the
selection
of
a
manager
of
the
company
who
has
been
specially
trained
to
that
particular
trade
and
who
engages
to
devote
all
his
experience
and
all
his
ability
to
the
affairs
of
the
company
the
directors
and
often
a
select
committee
of
them
more
especially
consult
with
the
manager
and
after
hearing
what
he
has
to
say
decide
on
the
affairs
of
the
company
there
is
in
all
ordinary
joint
stock
companies
a
fixed
executive
specially
skilled
and
a
somewhat
varying
council
not
specially
skilled
the
fixed
manager
ensures
continuity
and
experience
in
the
management
and
a
good
board
of
directors
ensures
general
wisdom
but
in
the
bank
of
england
there
is
no
fixed
executive
the
governor
and
who
form
that
executive
change
every
two
years
i
believe
indeed
that
such
was
not
the
original
intention
of
the
founders
in
the
old
days
of
few
and
great
privileged
companies
the
chairman
though
periodically
elected
was
practically
permanent
so
long
as
his
policy
was
popular
he
was
the
head
of
the
ministry
and
ordinarily
did
not
change
unless
the
opposition
came
in
but
this
idea
has
no
present
relation
to
the
constitution
of
the
bank
of
england
at
present
the
governor
and
almost
always
change
at
the
end
of
two
years
the
case
of
any
longer
occupation
of
the
chair
is
so
very
rare
that
it
need
not
be
taken
account
of
and
the
governor
and
of
the
bank
can
not
well
be
shadows
they
are
expected
to
be
constantly
present
to
see
all
applicants
for
advances
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
to
carry
on
the
almost
continuous
correspondence
between
the
bank
and
its
largest
customer
the
government
to
bring
all
necessary
matters
before
the
board
of
directors
or
the
committee
of
treasury
in
a
word
to
do
very
much
of
what
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
manager
in
most
companies
under
this
shifting
chief
executive
there
are
indeed
very
valuable
heads
of
departments
the
head
of
the
discount
department
is
especially
required
to
be
a
man
of
ability
and
experience
but
these
officers
are
essentially
subordinate
no
one
of
them
is
like
the
general
manager
of
an
ordinary
bank
the
head
of
all
action
the
perpetually
present
executive
the
governor
and
make
it
impossible
that
any
subordinate
should
have
that
position
a
really
able
and
governor
being
required
to
sit
all
day
in
the
bank
in
fact
does
and
can
hardly
help
doing
its
principal
business
in
theory
nothing
can
be
worse
than
this
government
for
a
bank
a
shifting
executive
a
board
of
directors
chosen
too
young
for
it
to
be
known
whether
they
are
able
a
committee
of
management
in
which
seniority
is
the
necessary
qualification
and
old
age
the
common
result
and
no
trained
bankers
anywhere
even
if
the
bank
of
england
were
an
ordinary
bank
such
a
constitution
would
be
insufficient
but
its
inadequacy
is
greater
and
the
consequences
of
that
inadequacy
far
worse
because
of
its
greater
functions
the
bank
of
england
has
to
keep
the
sole
banking
reserve
of
the
country
has
to
keep
it
through
all
changes
of
the
money
market
and
all
turns
of
the
exchanges
has
to
decide
on
the
instant
in
a
panic
what
sort
of
advances
should
be
made
to
what
amounts
and
for
what
dates
and
yet
it
has
a
constitution
plainly
defective
so
far
the
government
of
the
bank
of
england
being
better
than
that
of
any
other
bank
as
it
ought
to
be
considering
that
its
functions
are
much
harder
and
graver
any
one
would
be
laughed
at
who
proposed
it
as
a
model
for
the
government
of
a
new
bank
and
that
government
if
it
were
so
proposed
would
on
all
hands
be
called
and
curious
as
was
natural
the
effects
good
and
evil
of
its
constitution
are
to
be
seen
in
every
part
of
the
bank
history
on
one
vital
point
the
bank
management
has
been
excellent
it
has
done
perhaps
less
business
certainly
less
very
bad
business
than
any
bank
of
the
same
size
and
the
same
age
in
all
its
history
i
do
not
know
that
its
name
has
ever
been
connected
with
a
single
large
and
discreditable
bad
debt
there
has
never
been
a
suspicion
that
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
any
one
man
or
any
combination
of
men
the
great
respectability
of
the
directors
and
the
steady
attention
many
of
them
have
always
given
the
business
of
the
bank
have
kept
it
entirely
free
from
anything
dishonorable
and
discreditable
steady
merchants
collected
in
council
are
an
admirable
judge
of
bills
and
securities
they
always
know
the
questionable
standing
of
dangerous
persons
they
are
quick
to
note
the
smallest
signs
of
corrupt
transactions
and
no
sophistry
will
persuade
the
best
of
them
out
of
their
good
instincts
you
could
not
have
made
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
do
the
sort
of
business
which
at
last
did
except
by
a
moral
miracle
except
by
changing
their
nature
and
the
fatal
career
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
would
under
their
management
have
been
equally
impossible
of
the
ultimate
solvency
of
the
bank
of
england
or
of
the
eventual
safety
of
its
vast
capital
even
at
the
worst
periods
of
its
history
there
has
not
been
the
least
doubt
but
nevertheless
as
we
have
seen
the
policy
of
the
bank
has
frequently
been
deplorable
and
at
such
times
the
defects
of
its
government
have
aggravated
if
not
caused
its
calamities
in
truth
the
executive
of
the
bank
of
england
is
now
much
such
as
the
executive
of
a
public
department
of
the
foreign
office
or
the
home
office
would
be
in
which
there
was
no
responsible
permanent
head
in
these
departments
of
government
the
actual
chief
changes
nearly
though
not
quite
as
often
as
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
the
parliamentary
the
so
to
speak
of
that
office
changes
nearly
as
often
and
if
the
administration
solely
or
in
its
details
depended
on
these
two
it
would
stop
new
men
could
not
carry
it
on
with
vigour
and
efficiency
indeed
they
could
not
carry
it
on
at
all
but
in
fact
they
are
assisted
by
a
permanent
who
manages
all
the
routine
business
who
is
the
depository
of
the
secrets
of
the
office
who
embodies
its
traditions
who
is
the
hyphen
between
changing
administrations
in
consequence
of
this
assistance
the
continuous
business
of
the
department
is
for
the
most
part
managed
sufficiently
well
notwithstanding
frequent
changes
in
the
heads
of
administration
and
it
is
only
by
such
assistance
that
such
business
could
be
so
managed
the
present
administration
of
the
bank
is
an
attempt
to
manage
a
great
a
growing
and
a
permanently
continuous
business
without
an
adequate
permanent
element
and
a
competent
connecting
link
in
answer
it
may
be
said
that
the
duties
which
press
on
the
governor
and
of
the
bank
are
not
so
great
or
so
urgent
as
those
which
press
upon
the
heads
of
official
departments
and
perhaps
in
point
of
mere
labour
the
governor
of
the
bank
has
the
advantage
banking
never
ought
to
be
an
exceedingly
laborious
trade
there
must
be
a
great
want
of
system
and
a
great
deficiency
in
skilled
assistance
if
extreme
labour
is
thrown
upon
the
chief
but
in
importance
the
functions
of
the
head
of
the
bank
rank
as
high
as
those
of
any
department
the
cash
reserve
of
the
country
is
as
precious
a
deposit
as
any
set
of
men
can
have
the
care
of
and
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
a
panic
as
the
administration
of
the
bank
is
forced
to
deal
with
it
is
perhaps
a
more
formidable
instant
difficulty
than
presses
upon
any
single
minister
at
any
rate
it
comes
more
suddenly
and
must
be
dealt
with
more
immediately
than
most
comparable
difficulties
and
the
judgment
the
nerve
and
the
vigour
needful
to
deal
with
it
are
plainly
rare
and
great
the
natural
remedy
would
be
to
appoint
a
permanent
governor
of
the
bank
nor
as
i
have
said
can
there
be
much
doubt
that
such
was
the
intention
of
its
founders
all
the
old
companies
which
have
their
beginning
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
the
same
constitution
and
those
of
them
which
have
lingered
down
to
our
time
retain
it
the
hudson
bay
company
the
south
sea
company
the
east
india
company
were
all
founded
with
a
sort
of
sovereign
executive
intended
to
be
permanent
and
intended
to
be
efficient
this
is
indeed
the
most
natural
mode
of
forming
a
company
in
the
minds
of
those
to
whom
companies
are
new
such
persons
will
have
always
seen
business
transacted
a
good
deal
despotically
they
will
have
learnt
the
value
of
prompt
decision
and
of
consistent
policy
they
will
have
often
seen
that
business
is
best
managed
when
those
who
are
conducting
it
could
scarcely
justify
the
course
they
are
pursuing
by
distinct
argument
which
others
could
understand
all
people
make
their
money
by
investments
for
which
there
are
often
good
argumentative
reasons
but
they
would
hardly
ever
be
able
if
required
before
a
parliamentary
committee
to
state
those
reasons
they
have
become
used
to
act
on
them
without
distinctly
analysing
them
and
in
a
monarchical
way
with
continued
success
only
as
a
test
of
their
goodness
naturally
such
persons
when
proceeding
to
form
a
company
make
it
upon
the
model
of
that
which
they
have
been
used
to
see
successful
they
provide
for
the
executive
first
and
above
all
things
how
much
this
was
in
the
minds
of
the
founders
of
the
bank
of
england
may
be
judged
of
by
the
name
which
they
gave
it
its
corporate
name
is
the
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
so
important
did
the
founders
think
the
executive
that
they
mentioned
it
distinctly
and
mentioned
it
first
and
not
only
is
this
constitution
of
a
company
the
most
natural
in
the
early
days
when
companies
were
new
it
is
also
that
which
experience
has
shown
to
be
the
most
efficient
now
that
companies
have
long
been
tried
great
railway
companies
are
managed
upon
no
other
scarcely
any
instance
of
great
success
in
a
railway
can
be
mentioned
in
which
the
chairman
has
not
been
an
active
and
judicious
man
of
business
constantly
attending
to
the
affairs
of
the
company
a
thousand
instances
of
railway
disaster
can
be
easily
found
in
which
the
chairman
was
only
a
nominal
head
a
nobleman
or
something
of
that
sort
chosen
for
show
chairmanship
has
become
a
profession
so
much
is
efficiency
valued
in
it
and
so
indispensable
has
ability
been
found
to
be
the
plan
of
appointing
a
permanent
at
the
bank
of
england
is
strongly
supported
by
much
modern
experience
nevertheless
i
hesitate
as
to
its
expediency
at
any
rate
there
are
other
plans
which
for
several
reasons
should
i
think
first
be
tried
in
preference
first
this
plan
would
be
exceedingly
unpopular
a
permanent
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
england
he
would
be
a
little
in
the
city
he
would
be
far
greater
than
the
mayor
he
would
be
the
personal
embodiment
of
the
bank
of
england
he
would
be
constantly
clothed
with
an
almost
indefinite
prestige
everybody
in
business
would
bow
down
before
him
and
try
to
stand
well
with
him
for
he
might
in
a
panic
be
able
to
save
almost
anyone
he
liked
and
to
ruin
almost
anyone
he
liked
a
day
might
come
when
his
favour
might
mean
prosperity
and
his
distrust
might
mean
ruin
a
position
with
so
much
real
power
and
so
much
apparent
dignity
would
be
intensely
coveted
practical
men
would
be
apt
to
say
that
it
was
better
than
the
prime
ministership
for
it
would
last
much
longer
and
would
have
a
greater
jurisdiction
over
that
which
practical
men
would
most
value
over
money
at
all
events
such
a
governor
if
he
understood
his
business
might
make
the
fortunes
of
fifty
men
where
the
prime
minister
can
make
that
of
one
scarcely
anything
could
be
more
unpopular
in
the
city
than
the
appointment
of
a
little
king
to
reign
over
them
secondly
i
do
not
believe
that
we
should
always
get
the
best
man
for
the
post
often
i
fear
that
we
should
not
even
get
a
tolerable
man
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
offer
of
too
high
a
pay
would
prevent
our
obtaining
the
man
we
wish
for
and
this
is
one
of
them
a
very
high
pay
of
prestige
is
almost
always
very
dangerous
it
causes
the
post
to
be
desired
by
vain
men
by
lazy
men
by
men
of
rank
and
when
that
post
is
one
of
real
and
technical
business
and
when
therefore
it
requires
much
previous
training
much
continuous
labour
and
much
patient
and
quick
judgment
all
such
men
are
dangerous
but
they
are
sure
to
covet
all
posts
of
splendid
dignity
and
can
only
be
kept
out
of
them
with
the
greatest
difficulty
probably
in
every
cabinet
there
are
still
some
members
in
the
days
of
the
old
close
boroughs
there
were
many
whose
posts
have
come
to
them
not
from
personal
ability
or
inherent
merit
but
from
their
rank
their
wealth
or
even
their
imposing
exterior
the
highest
political
offices
are
indeed
kept
clear
of
such
people
for
in
them
serious
and
important
duties
must
constantly
be
performed
in
the
face
of
the
world
a
prime
minister
or
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
or
a
secretary
of
state
must
explain
his
policy
and
defend
his
actions
in
parliament
and
the
discriminating
tact
of
a
critical
assembly
abounding
in
experience
and
guided
by
tradition
will
soon
discover
what
he
is
but
the
governor
of
the
bank
would
only
perform
quiet
functions
which
look
like
routine
though
they
are
not
in
which
there
is
no
immediate
risk
of
success
or
failure
which
years
hence
may
indeed
issue
in
a
crop
of
bad
debts
but
which
any
grave
persons
may
make
at
the
time
to
look
fair
and
plausible
a
large
bank
is
exactly
the
place
where
a
vain
and
shallow
person
in
authority
if
he
be
a
man
of
gravity
and
method
as
such
men
often
are
may
do
infinite
evil
in
no
long
time
and
before
he
is
detected
if
he
is
lucky
enough
to
begin
at
a
time
of
expansion
in
trade
he
is
nearly
sure
not
to
be
found
out
till
the
time
of
contraction
has
arrived
and
then
very
large
figures
will
be
required
to
reckon
the
evil
he
has
done
and
thirdly
i
fear
that
the
possession
of
such
patronage
would
ruin
any
set
of
persons
in
whose
gift
it
was
the
election
of
the
chairman
must
be
placed
either
in
the
court
of
proprietors
or
that
of
the
directors
if
the
proprietors
choose
there
will
be
something
like
the
evils
of
an
american
presidential
election
bank
stock
will
be
bought
in
order
to
confer
the
qualification
of
voting
at
the
election
of
the
of
the
city
the
chairman
when
elected
may
well
find
that
his
most
active
supporters
are
large
borrowers
of
the
bank
and
he
may
well
be
puzzled
to
decide
between
his
duty
to
the
bank
and
his
gratitude
to
those
who
chose
him
probably
if
he
be
a
cautious
man
of
average
ability
he
will
combine
both
evils
he
will
not
lend
so
much
money
as
he
is
asked
for
and
so
will
offend
his
own
supporters
but
will
lend
some
which
will
be
lost
and
so
the
profits
of
the
bank
will
be
reduced
a
large
body
of
bank
proprietors
would
make
but
a
bad
elective
body
for
an
office
of
great
prestige
they
would
not
commonly
choose
a
good
person
and
the
person
they
did
choose
would
be
bound
by
promises
that
would
make
him
less
good
the
court
of
directors
would
choose
better
a
small
body
of
men
of
business
would
not
easily
be
persuaded
to
choose
an
extremely
unfit
man
but
they
would
not
often
choose
an
extremely
good
man
the
really
best
man
would
probably
not
be
so
rich
as
the
majority
of
the
directors
nor
of
so
much
standing
and
not
unnaturally
they
would
much
dislike
to
elevate
to
the
headship
of
the
city
one
who
was
much
less
in
the
estimation
of
the
city
than
themselves
and
they
would
be
canvassed
in
every
way
and
on
every
side
to
appoint
a
man
of
mercantile
dignity
or
mercantile
influence
many
people
of
the
greatest
prestige
and
rank
in
the
city
would
covet
so
great
a
dignity
if
not
for
themselves
at
least
for
some
friend
or
some
relative
and
so
the
directors
would
be
set
upon
from
every
side
an
election
so
liable
to
be
disturbed
by
powerful
vitiating
causes
would
rarely
end
in
a
good
choice
the
best
candidate
would
almost
never
be
chosen
often
i
fear
one
would
be
chosen
altogether
unfit
for
a
post
so
important
and
the
excitement
of
so
keen
an
election
would
altogether
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
bank
the
good
and
efficient
working
of
a
board
of
bank
directors
depends
on
its
internal
harmony
and
that
harmony
would
be
broken
for
ever
by
the
excitement
the
sayings
and
the
acts
of
a
great
election
the
board
of
directors
would
almost
certainly
be
demoralised
by
having
to
choose
a
sovereign
and
there
is
no
certainty
nor
any
great
likelihood
indeed
that
they
would
choose
a
good
one
in
france
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
good
body
to
choose
the
governor
of
the
bank
has
been
met
characteristically
the
bank
of
france
keeps
the
money
of
the
state
and
the
state
appoints
its
governor
the
french
have
generally
a
logical
reason
to
give
for
all
they
do
though
perhaps
the
results
of
their
actions
are
not
always
so
good
as
the
reasons
for
them
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
france
has
not
always
i
am
told
been
a
very
competent
person
the
whom
the
state
also
appoints
is
as
we
might
expect
usually
better
but
for
our
english
purposes
it
would
be
useless
to
inquire
minutely
into
this
no
english
statesman
would
consent
to
be
responsible
for
the
choice
of
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
after
every
panic
the
opposition
would
say
in
parliament
that
the
calamity
had
been
aggravated
if
not
wholly
caused
by
the
misconduct
of
the
governor
appointed
by
the
ministry
or
possibly
offices
may
have
changed
occupants
and
the
ministry
in
power
at
the
panic
would
be
the
opponents
of
the
ministry
which
at
a
former
time
appointed
the
governor
in
that
case
they
would
be
apt
to
feel
and
to
intimate
a
regret
at
the
course
which
the
nominee
of
their
adversaries
had
it
desirable
to
pursue
they
would
not
much
mind
hurting
his
feelings
and
if
he
resigned
they
would
have
themselves
a
valuable
piece
of
patronage
to
confer
on
one
of
their
own
friends
no
result
could
be
worse
than
that
the
conduct
of
the
bank
and
the
management
should
be
made
a
matter
of
party
politics
and
men
of
all
parties
would
agree
in
this
even
if
they
agreed
in
almost
nothing
else
i
am
therefore
afraid
that
we
must
abandon
the
plan
of
improving
the
government
of
the
bank
of
england
by
the
appointment
of
a
permanent
governor
because
we
should
not
be
sure
of
choosing
a
good
governor
and
should
indeed
run
a
great
risk
for
the
most
part
of
choosing
a
bad
one
i
think
however
that
much
of
the
advantage
with
little
of
the
risk
might
be
secured
by
a
humbler
scheme
in
english
political
offices
as
was
observed
before
the
evil
of
a
changing
head
is
made
possible
by
the
permanence
of
a
dignified
subordinate
though
the
parliamentary
secretary
of
state
and
the
parliamentary
go
in
and
out
with
each
administration
another
remains
through
all
such
changes
and
is
on
that
account
called
now
this
system
seems
to
me
in
its
principle
perfectly
applicable
to
the
administration
of
the
bank
of
england
for
the
reasons
which
have
just
been
given
a
permanent
ruler
of
the
bank
of
england
can
not
be
appointed
for
other
reasons
which
were
just
before
given
some
most
influential
permanent
functionary
is
essential
in
the
proper
conduct
of
the
business
of
the
bank
and
mutatis
mutandis
these
are
the
very
difficulties
and
the
very
advantages
which
have
led
us
to
frame
our
principal
offices
of
state
in
the
present
fashion
such
a
would
not
be
at
all
a
in
the
city
there
would
be
no
mischievous
prestige
about
the
office
there
would
be
no
attraction
in
it
for
a
vain
man
and
there
would
be
nothing
to
make
it
an
object
of
a
violent
canvass
or
of
unscrupulous
electioneering
the
office
would
be
essentially
subordinate
in
its
character
just
like
the
permanent
secretary
in
a
political
office
the
pay
should
be
high
for
good
ability
is
wanted
but
no
pay
would
attract
the
most
dangerous
class
of
people
the
very
influential
but
not
very
wise
city
dignitary
who
would
be
so
very
dangerous
is
usually
very
opulent
he
would
hardly
have
such
influence
he
were
not
opulent
what
he
wants
is
not
money
but
a
governorship
of
the
bank
of
england
he
would
take
almost
without
salary
perhaps
he
would
even
pay
to
get
it
but
a
minor
office
of
essential
subordination
would
not
attract
him
at
all
we
may
augment
the
pay
enough
to
get
a
good
man
without
fearing
that
by
such
pay
we
may
tempt
as
by
social
privilege
we
should
tempt
exactly
the
sort
of
man
we
do
not
want
undoubtedly
such
a
permanent
official
should
be
a
trained
banker
there
is
a
cardinal
difference
between
banking
and
other
kinds
of
commerce
you
can
afford
to
run
much
less
risk
in
banking
than
in
commerce
and
you
must
take
much
greater
precautions
in
common
business
the
trader
can
add
to
the
cost
price
of
the
goods
he
sells
a
large
mercantile
profit
say
to
per
cent
but
the
banker
has
to
be
content
with
the
interest
of
money
which
in
england
is
not
so
much
as
per
cent
upon
the
average
the
business
of
a
banker
therefore
can
not
bear
so
many
bad
debts
as
that
of
a
merchant
and
he
must
be
much
more
cautious
to
whom
he
gives
credit
real
money
is
a
commodity
much
more
coveted
than
common
goods
for
one
deceit
which
is
attempted
on
a
manufacturer
or
a
merchant
twenty
or
more
are
attempted
on
a
banker
and
besides
a
banker
dealing
with
the
money
of
others
and
money
payable
on
demand
must
be
always
as
it
were
looking
behind
him
and
seeing
that
he
has
reserve
enough
in
store
if
payment
should
be
asked
for
which
a
merchant
dealing
mostly
with
his
own
capital
need
not
think
of
adventure
is
the
life
of
commerce
but
caution
i
had
almost
said
timidity
is
the
life
of
banking
and
i
can
not
imagine
that
the
long
series
of
great
errors
made
by
the
bank
of
england
in
the
management
of
its
reserve
till
after
would
have
been
possible
if
the
merchants
in
the
bank
court
had
not
erroneously
taken
the
same
view
of
the
bank
business
that
they
must
properly
take
of
their
own
mercantile
business
the
bank
directors
have
almost
always
been
too
cheerful
as
to
the
business
and
too
little
disposed
to
take
alarm
what
we
want
to
introduce
into
the
bank
court
is
a
wise
apprehensiveness
and
this
every
trained
banker
is
taught
by
the
habits
of
his
trade
and
the
atmosphere
of
his
life
the
permanent
governor
ought
to
give
his
whole
time
to
the
business
of
the
bank
he
ought
to
be
forbidden
to
engage
in
any
other
concern
all
the
present
directors
including
the
governor
and
are
engaged
in
their
own
business
and
it
is
very
possible
indeed
it
must
perpetually
have
happened
that
their
own
business
as
merchants
most
occupied
the
minds
of
most
of
them
just
when
it
was
most
important
that
the
business
of
the
bank
should
occupy
them
it
is
at
a
panic
and
just
before
a
panic
that
the
business
of
the
bank
is
most
exacting
and
most
engrossing
but
just
at
that
time
the
business
of
most
merchants
must
be
unusually
occupying
and
may
be
exceedingly
critical
by
the
present
constitution
of
the
bank
the
attention
of
its
sole
rulers
is
most
apt
to
be
diverted
from
the
bank
affairs
just
when
those
affairs
require
that
attention
the
most
and
the
only
remedy
is
the
appointment
of
a
permanent
and
influential
man
who
will
have
no
business
save
that
of
the
bank
and
who
therefore
presumably
will
attend
most
to
it
at
the
critical
instant
when
attention
is
most
required
his
mind
at
any
rate
will
in
a
panic
be
free
from
pecuniary
anxiety
whereas
many
if
not
all
of
the
present
directors
must
be
incessantly
thinking
of
their
own
affairs
and
unable
to
banish
them
from
their
minds
the
permanent
must
be
a
director
and
a
man
of
fair
position
he
must
not
have
to
say
to
the
governor
there
is
no
fair
argument
between
an
inferior
who
has
to
exhibit
respect
and
a
superior
who
has
to
receive
respect
the
superior
can
always
and
does
mostly
refute
the
bad
arguments
of
his
inferior
but
the
inferior
rarely
ventures
to
try
to
refute
the
bad
arguments
of
his
superior
and
he
still
more
rarely
states
his
case
effectually
he
pauses
hesitates
does
not
use
the
best
word
or
the
most
apt
illustration
perhaps
he
uses
a
faulty
illustration
or
a
wrong
word
and
so
fails
because
the
superior
immediately
exposes
him
important
business
can
only
be
sufficiently
discussed
by
persons
who
can
say
very
much
what
they
like
very
much
as
they
like
to
one
another
the
thought
of
the
speaker
should
come
out
as
it
was
in
his
mind
and
not
be
hidden
in
respectful
expressions
or
enfeebled
by
affected
doubt
what
is
wanted
at
the
bank
is
not
a
new
clerk
to
the
directors
they
have
excellent
clerks
of
great
experience
now
but
a
permanent
equal
to
the
directors
who
shall
be
able
to
discuss
on
equal
terms
with
them
the
business
of
the
bank
and
have
this
advantage
over
them
in
discussion
that
he
has
no
other
business
than
that
of
the
bank
to
think
of
the
formal
duties
of
such
a
permanent
officer
could
only
be
defined
by
some
one
conversant
with
the
business
of
the
bank
and
could
scarcely
be
intelligibly
discussed
before
the
public
nor
are
the
precise
duties
of
the
least
importance
such
an
officer
if
sound
able
and
industrious
would
soon
rule
the
affairs
of
the
bank
he
would
be
acquainted
better
than
anyone
else
both
with
the
traditions
of
the
past
and
with
the
facts
of
the
present
he
would
have
a
great
experience
he
would
have
seen
many
anxious
times
he
would
always
be
on
the
watch
for
their
recurrence
and
he
would
have
a
peculiar
power
of
guidance
at
such
moments
from
the
nature
of
the
men
with
whom
he
has
most
to
deal
most
governors
of
the
bank
of
england
are
cautious
merchants
not
profoundly
skilled
in
banking
but
most
anxious
that
their
period
of
office
should
be
prosperous
and
that
they
should
themselves
escape
censure
if
a
course
is
pressed
upon
them
they
are
likely
to
take
that
course
now
it
would
almost
always
be
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
great
standing
it
would
always
be
most
not
to
follow
it
if
the
changing
governor
act
on
the
advice
of
the
permanent
most
of
the
blame
in
case
of
mischance
would
fall
on
the
latter
it
would
be
said
that
a
shifting
officer
like
the
governor
might
very
likely
not
know
what
should
be
done
but
that
the
permanent
official
was
put
there
to
know
it
and
paid
to
know
it
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
changing
governor
should
disregard
the
advice
of
his
permanent
colleague
and
the
consequence
should
be
bad
he
would
be
blamed
exceedingly
it
would
be
said
that
without
experience
he
had
taken
upon
him
to
overrule
men
who
had
much
experience
that
when
the
constitution
of
the
bank
had
provided
them
with
skilled
counsel
he
had
taken
on
himself
to
act
of
his
own
head
and
to
disregard
that
counsel
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
and
there
could
be
no
sort
of
conversation
more
injurious
to
a
man
in
the
city
the
world
there
would
say
rightly
or
wrongly
must
never
be
too
severe
on
errors
of
judgment
we
are
all
making
them
every
day
if
responsible
persons
do
their
best
we
can
expect
no
more
but
this
case
is
different
the
governor
acted
on
a
wrong
system
he
took
upon
himself
an
unnecessary
responsibility
and
so
a
governor
who
incurred
disaster
by
disregarding
his
skilled
counsellor
would
be
thought
a
fool
in
the
city
for
ever
in
consequence
the
one
skilled
counsellor
would
in
fact
rule
the
bank
i
believe
that
the
appointment
of
the
new
permanent
and
skilled
authority
at
the
bank
is
the
greatest
reform
which
can
be
made
there
and
that
which
is
most
wanted
i
believe
that
such
a
person
would
give
to
the
decision
of
the
bank
that
foresight
that
quickness
and
that
consistency
in
which
those
decisions
are
undeniably
now
deficient
as
far
as
i
can
judge
this
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
bank
is
by
far
the
most
necessary
and
is
perhaps
more
important
even
than
all
other
changes
but
nevertheless
we
should
reform
the
other
points
which
we
have
seen
to
be
defective
first
the
london
bankers
should
not
be
altogether
excluded
from
the
court
of
directors
the
old
idea
as
i
have
explained
was
that
the
london
bankers
were
the
competitors
of
the
bank
of
england
and
would
hurt
it
if
they
could
but
now
the
london
bankers
have
another
relation
to
the
bank
which
did
not
then
exist
and
was
not
then
imagined
among
private
people
they
are
the
principal
depositors
in
the
bank
they
are
therefore
particularly
interested
in
its
stability
they
are
especially
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
a
good
banking
reserve
for
their
own
credit
and
the
safety
of
their
large
deposits
depend
on
it
and
they
can
bring
to
the
court
of
directors
an
experience
of
banking
itself
got
outside
the
bank
of
england
which
none
of
the
present
directors
possess
for
they
have
learned
all
they
know
of
banking
at
the
bank
itself
there
was
also
an
old
notion
that
the
secrets
of
the
bank
would
be
divulged
if
they
were
imparted
to
bankers
but
probably
bankers
are
better
trained
to
silence
and
secrecy
than
most
people
and
there
is
only
a
thin
partition
now
between
the
bankers
and
the
secrets
of
the
bank
only
lately
a
firm
failed
of
which
one
partner
was
a
director
of
the
london
and
westminster
bank
and
another
a
director
of
the
bank
of
england
who
can
define
or
class
the
confidential
communications
of
such
persons
under
such
circumstances
as
i
observed
before
the
line
drawn
at
present
against
bankers
is
very
technical
and
exclusively
english
according
to
continental
ideas
rothschild
are
bankers
if
any
one
is
a
banker
but
the
house
of
rothschild
is
represented
on
the
bank
direction
and
it
is
most
desirable
that
it
should
be
represented
for
members
of
that
firm
can
give
if
they
choose
confidential
information
of
great
value
to
the
bank
but
nevertheless
the
objection
which
is
urged
against
english
bankers
is
at
least
equally
applicable
to
these
foreign
bankers
they
have
or
may
have
at
certain
periods
an
interest
opposite
to
the
policy
of
the
bank
as
the
greatest
exchange
dealers
they
may
wish
to
export
gold
just
when
the
bank
of
england
is
raising
its
rate
of
interest
to
prevent
anyone
from
exporting
gold
the
vote
of
a
great
exchange
dealer
might
be
objected
to
for
plausible
reasons
of
contrary
interest
if
any
such
reasons
were
worth
regarding
but
in
fact
the
particular
interest
of
single
directors
is
not
to
be
regarded
almost
all
directors
who
bring
special
information
labour
under
a
suspicion
of
interest
they
can
only
have
acquired
that
information
in
present
business
and
such
business
may
very
possibly
be
affected
for
good
or
evil
by
the
policy
of
the
bank
but
you
must
not
on
this
account
seal
up
the
bank
hermetically
against
living
information
you
must
make
a
fair
body
of
directors
upon
the
whole
and
trust
that
the
bias
of
some
individual
interests
will
disappear
and
be
lost
in
the
whole
and
if
this
is
to
be
the
guiding
principle
it
is
not
consistent
to
exclude
english
bankers
from
the
court
objection
is
often
also
taken
to
the
constitution
of
the
committee
of
treasury
that
body
is
composed
of
the
governor
and
and
all
the
directors
who
have
held
those
offices
but
as
those
offices
in
the
main
pass
in
rotation
this
mode
of
election
very
much
comes
to
an
election
by
seniority
and
there
are
obvious
objections
to
giving
not
only
a
preponderance
to
age
but
a
monopoly
to
age
in
some
cases
indeed
this
monopoly
i
believe
has
already
been
infringed
when
directors
have
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
their
transactions
and
the
consequent
engrossing
nature
of
their
business
declined
to
fill
the
chair
in
some
cases
they
have
been
asked
to
be
members
of
the
committee
of
treasury
notwithstanding
and
it
would
certainly
upon
principle
seem
wiser
to
choose
a
committee
which
for
some
purposes
approximates
to
a
committee
of
management
by
competence
rather
than
by
seniority
an
objection
is
also
taken
to
the
large
number
of
bank
directors
there
are
directors
a
governor
and
a
making
a
total
court
of
persons
which
is
obviously
too
large
for
the
real
discussion
of
any
difficult
business
and
the
case
is
worse
because
the
court
only
meets
once
a
week
and
only
sits
a
very
short
time
it
has
been
said
with
exaggeration
but
not
without
a
basis
of
truth
that
if
the
bank
directors
were
to
sit
for
four
hours
there
would
be
panic
solely
from
that
court
says
tooke
at
eleven
or
twelve
and
if
the
sitting
be
prolonged
beyond
one
the
stock
exchange
and
the
money
market
become
excited
under
the
idea
that
a
change
of
importance
is
under
discussion
and
persons
congregate
about
the
doors
of
the
bank
parlour
to
obtain
the
earliest
intimation
of
the
decision
and
he
proceeds
to
conjecture
that
the
knowledge
of
the
impatience
without
must
cause
haste
if
not
impatience
within
that
the
decisions
of
such
a
court
should
be
of
incalculable
importance
is
plainly
very
strange
there
should
be
no
delicacy
as
to
altering
the
constitution
of
the
bank
of
england
the
existing
constitution
was
framed
in
times
that
have
passed
away
and
was
intended
to
be
used
for
purposes
very
different
from
the
present
the
founders
may
have
considered
that
it
would
lend
money
to
the
government
that
it
would
keep
the
money
of
the
government
that
it
would
issue
notes
payable
to
bearer
but
that
it
would
keep
the
reserve
of
a
great
nation
no
one
in
the
seventeenth
century
imagined
and
when
the
use
to
which
we
are
putting
an
old
thing
is
a
new
use
in
common
sense
we
should
think
whether
the
old
thing
is
quite
fit
for
the
use
to
which
we
are
setting
it
new
wine
into
old
bottles
is
safe
only
when
you
watch
the
condition
of
the
bottle
and
adapt
its
structure

carefully
chapter
ix
the
joint
stock
banks
the
joint
stock
banks
of
this
country
are
a
most
remarkable
success
generally
speaking
the
career
of
joint
stock
companies
in
this
country
has
been
chequered
adam
smith
many
years
since
threw
out
many
pregnant
hints
on
the
difficulty
of
such
undertakings
hints
which
even
after
so
many
years
will
well
repay
perusal
but
joint
stock
banking
has
been
an
exception
to
this
rule
four
years
ago
i
threw
together
the
facts
on
the
subject
and
the
reasons
for
them
and
i
venture
to
quote
the
article
because
subsequent
experience
suggests
i
think
little
to
be
added
to
it
main
classes
of
joint
stock
companies
which
have
answered
are
three
those
in
which
the
capital
is
used
not
to
work
the
business
but
to
guarantee
the
business
thus
a
banker
business
his
proper
business
does
not
begin
while
he
is
using
his
own
money
it
commences
when
he
begins
to
use
the
capital
of
others
an
insurance
office
in
the
long
run
needs
no
capital
the
premiums
which
are
received
ought
to
exceed
the
claims
which
accrue
in
both
cases
the
capital
is
wanted
to
assure
the
public
and
to
induce
it
to
trust
the
concern
those
companies
have
answered
which
have
an
exclusive
privilege
which
they
have
used
with
judgment
or
which
possibly
was
so
very
profitable
as
to
enable
them
to
thrive
with
little
judgment
those
which
have
undertaken
a
business
both
large
and
simple
employing
more
money
than
most
individuals
or
private
firms
have
at
command
and
yet
such
that
in
adam
words
the
operations
are
capable
of
being
reduced
to
a
routine
or
such
an
uniformity
of
method
as
admits
of
no
variation
a
rule
the
most
profitable
of
these
companies
are
banks
indeed
all
the
favouring
conditions
just
mentioned
concur
in
many
banks
an
bank
has
a
prestige
which
amounts
to
a
privileged
opportunity
though
no
exclusive
right
is
given
to
it
by
law
a
peculiar
power
is
given
to
it
by
opinion
the
business
of
banking
ought
to
be
simple
if
it
is
hard
it
is
wrong
the
only
securities
which
a
banker
using
money
that
he
may
be
asked
at
short
notice
to
repay
ought
to
touch
are
those
which
are
easily
saleable
and
easily
intelligible
if
there
is
a
difficulty
or
a
doubt
the
security
should
be
declined
no
business
can
of
course
be
quite
reduced
to
fixed
rules
there
must
be
occasional
cases
which
no
theory
can
define
but
banking
comes
as
near
to
fixed
rules
certainly
as
any
existing
business
perhaps
as
any
possible
business
the
business
of
an
bank
has
the
full
advantage
of
being
a
simple
business
and
in
part
the
advantage
of
being
a
monopoly
business
competition
with
it
is
only
open
in
the
sense
in
which
competition
with
the
london
tavern
is
open
anyone
that
has
to
do
with
either
will
pay
dear
for
it
the
main
source
of
the
profitableness
of
established
banking
is
the
smallness
of
the
requisite
capital
being
only
wanted
as
a
moral
influence
it
need
not
be
more
than
is
necessary
to
secure
that
influence
although
therefore
a
banker
deals
only
with
the
most
sure
securities
and
with
those
which
yield
the
least
interest
he
can
nevertheless
gain
and
divide
a
very
large
profit
upon
his
own
capital
because
the
money
in
his
hands
is
so
much
larger
than
that
capital
as
shown
by
plain
figures
confirms
these
conclusions
we
print
at
the
end
of
this
article
the
respective
profits
of
banks
in
england
and
scotland
and
ireland
being
all
in
those
countries
of
which
we
have
sufficient
information
the
bank
of
england
excepted
there
are
no
doubt
others
but
they
are
not
quoted
even
on
local
stock
exchange
lists
and
in
most
cases
publish
no
reports
the
result
of
these
banks
as
regards
the
dividends
they
pay
is
no
of
companies
capital
l
above
per
cent
between
and
per
cent
and
per
cent
and
per
cent
under
per
cent
that
is
to
say
above
per
cent
of
the
capital
employed
in
these
banks
pays
over
per
cent
and
per
cent
of
the
capital
pays
more
than
per
cent
so
striking
a
result
is
not
to
be
shown
in
any
other
joint
stock
trade
period
to
which
these
accounts
refer
was
certainly
not
a
particularly
profitable
one
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
specially
unprofitable
the
rate
of
interest
has
been
very
low
and
the
amount
of
good
security
in
the
market
small
many
banks
to
some
extent
most
banks
probably
had
in
their
books
painful
reminiscences
of
the
fever
of
excitement
which
passed
over
the
nation
was
strongest
in
the
classes
to
whom
banks
lent
most
and
consequently
the
losses
of
even
the
most
careful
banks
save
of
those
in
rural
and
sheltered
situations
were
probably
greater
than
usual
but
even
tried
by
this
very
unfavourable
test
banking
is
a
trade
profitable
far
beyond
the
average
of
trades
is
no
attempt
in
these
banks
on
the
whole
and
as
a
rule
to
divide
too
much
on
the
contrary
they
have
accumulated
about
or
nearly
rd
of
their
capital
principally
out
of
undivided
profits
the
directors
of
some
of
them
have
been
anxious
to
put
away
as
much
as
possible
and
to
divide
as
little
as
possible
reason
is
plain
out
of
the
banks
which
pay
more
than
per
cent
all
but
one
were
banks
and
all
those
paying
between
and
per
cent
were
old
banks
too
the
privileged
opportunity
of
which
we
spoke
is
singularly
conspicuous
in
such
figures
it
enables
banks
to
pay
much
which
without
it
would
not
have
paid
much
the
amount
of
the
profit
is
clearly
proportional
to
the
value
of
the
privileged
opportunity
all
the
banks
which
pay
above
per
cent
save
one
are
banks
more
than
years
old
all
those
which
pay
between
and
are
so
too
a
new
bank
could
not
make
these
profits
or
even
by
its
competition
much
reduce
these
profits
in
attempting
to
do
so
it
would
simply
ruin
itself
not
possessing
the
accumulated
credit
of
years
it
would
have
to
wind
up
before
it
attained
that
credit
value
of
the
opportunity
too
is
proportioned
to
what
has
to
be
paid
for
it
some
old
banks
have
to
pay
interest
for
all
their
money
some
have
much
for
which
they
pay
nothing
those
who
give
much
to
their
customers
have
of
course
less
left
for
their
shareholders
thus
scotland
where
there
is
always
a
daily
interest
has
no
bank
in
the
lists
paying
over
per
cent
the
profits
of
scotch

good

enough
but
not
at
all
like
the
profits
of
the
london
and
westminster
or
the
other
most
lucrative
banks
of
the
south
bank
of
england
it
is
true
does
not
seem
to
pay
so
much
as
other
english
banks
in
this
way
of
reckoning
it
makes
an
immense
profit
but
then
its
capital
is
immense
too
in
fact
the
bank
of
england
suffers
under
two
difficulties
being
much
older
than
the
other
joint
stock
banks
it
belongs
to
a
less
profitable
era
when
it
was
founded
banks
looked
rather
to
the
profit
on
their
own
capital
and
to
the
gains
of
note
issue
than
to
the
use
of
deposits
the
first
relations
with
the
state
were
more
like
those
of
a
finance
company
than
of
a
bank
as
we
now
think
of
banking
if
the
bank
had
not
made
loans
to
the
government
which
we
should
now
think
dubious
the
bank
would
not
have
existed
for
the
government
would
never
have
permitted
it
not
only
is
the
capital
of
the
bank
of
england
relatively
greater
but
the
means
of
making
profit
in
the
bank
of
england
are
relatively
less
also
by
custom
and
understanding
the
bank
of
england
keep
a
much
greater
reserve
in
unprofitable
cash
than
other
banks
if
they
do
not
keep
it
either
our
whole
system
must
be
changed
or
we
should
break
up
in
utter
bankruptcy
the
earning
faculty
of
the
bank
of
england
is
in
proportion
less
than
that
of
other
banks
and
also
the
sum
on
which
it
has
to
pay
dividend
is
altogether
greater
than
theirs
is
interesting
to
compare
the
facts
of
joint
stock
banking
with
the
fears
of
it
which
were
felt
in
lord
overstone
observed
i
think
that
joint
stock
banks
are
deficient
in
everything
requisite
for
the
conduct
of
the
banking
business
except
extended
responsibility
the
banking
business
requires
peculiarly
persons
attentive
to
all
its
details
constantly
daily
and
hourly
watchful
of
every
transaction
much
more
than
mercantile
or
trading
business
it
also
requires
immediate
prompt
decisions
upon
circumstances
when
they
arise
in
many
cases
a
decision
that
does
not
admit
of
delay
for
consultation
it
also
requires
a
discretion
to
be
exercised
with
reference
to
the
special
circumstances
of
each
case
joint
stock
banks
being
of
course
obliged
to
act
through
agents
and
not
by
a
principal
and
therefore
under
the
restraint
of
general
rules
can
not
be
guided
by
so
nice
a
reference
to
degrees
of
difference
in
the
character
of
responsibility
of
parties
nor
can
they
undertake
to
regulate
the
assistance
to
be
granted
to
concerns
under
temporary
embarrassment
by
so
accurate
a
reference
to
the
circumstances
favourable
or
unfavourable
of
each
case
in
this
very
respect
joint
stock
banks
have
probably
improved
the
business
of
banking
the
old
private
banks
in
former
times
used
to
lend
much
to
private
individuals
the
banker
as
lord
overstone
on
another
occasion
explained
could
have
no
security
but
he
formed
his
judgment
of
the
discretion
the
sense
and
the
solvency
of
those
to
whom
he
lent
and
when
london
was
by
comparison
a
small
city
and
when
by
comparison
everyone
stuck
to
his
proper
business
this
practice
might
have
been
safe
but
now
that
london
is
enormous
and
that
no
one
can
watch
anyone
such
a
trade
would
be
disastrous
at
present
it
would
hardly
be
safe
in
a
country
town
the
joint
stock
banks
were
quite
unfit
for
the
business
lord
overstone
meant
but
then
that
business
is
quite
unfit
for
the
present
time
this
success
of
joint
stock
banking
is
very
contrary
to
the
general
expectation
at
its
origin
not
only
private
bankers
such
as
lord
overstone
then
was
but
a
great
number
of
thinking
persons
feared
that
the
joint
stock
banks
would
fast
ruin
themselves
and
then
cause
a
collapse
and
panic
in
the
country
the
whole
of
english
commercial
literature
between
and
is
filled
with
that
idea
nor
did
it
cease
in
so
late
as
sir
peel
thought
the
foundation
of
joint
stock
banks
so
dangerous
that
he
subjected
it
to
grave
and
exceptional
difficulty
under
the
act
of
which
he
proposed
no
such
companies
could
be
founded
except
with
shares
of
with
paid
up
on
each
which
effectually
checked
the
progress
of
such
banks
for
few
new
ones
were
established
for
many
years
or
till
that
act
had
been
repealed
but
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
perhaps
sir
peel
will
be
found
to
have
been
rather
than
he
was
afraid
of
certain
joint
stock
banks
which
he
saw
rising
around
him
but
the
effect
of
his
legislation
was
to
give
to
these
very
banks
if
not
a
monopoly
at
any
rate
an
exemption
from
new
rivals
no
one
now
founds
or
can
found
a
new
private
bank
and
sir
peel
by
law
prevented
new
joint
stock
banks
from
being
established
though
he
was
exceedingly
distrustful
of
the
joint
stock
banks
founded
between
and
yet
in
fact
he
was
their
especial
patron
and
he
more
than
any
other
man
encouraged
and
protected
them
but
in
this
wonderful
success
there
are
two
dubious
points
two
considerations
of
different
kinds
which
forbid
us
to
say
that
in
other
countries
even
in
countries
with
the
capacity
of
joint
stock
banks
would
succeed
as
well
as
we
have
seen
that
they
succeed
in
england
these
great
banks
have
not
had
to
keep
so
large
a
reserve
against
their
liabilities
as
it
was
natural
that
they
should
being
of
magnitude
keep
they
were
at
first
of
course
very
small
in
comparison
with
what
they
are
now
they
found
a
number
of
private
bankers
grouped
round
the
bank
of
england
and
they
added
themselves
to
the
group
not
only
did
they
keep
their
reserve
from
the
beginning
at
the
bank
of
england
but
they
did
not
keep
so
much
reserve
as
they
would
have
kept
if
there
had
been
no
bank
of
england
for
a
long
time
this
was
hardly
noticed
for
many
years
questions
of
the
particularly
questions
as
to
the
act
of
engrossed
the
attention
of
all
who
were
occupied
with
these
subjects
even
those
who
were
most
anxious
to
speak
evil
of
joint
stock
banks
did
not
mention
this
particular
evil
the
first
time
as
far
as
i
know
that
it
was
commented
on
in
any
important
document
was
in
an
official
letter
written
in
by
weguelin
who
was
then
governor
of
the
bank
to
sir
george
lewis
who
was
then
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
governor
and
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
had
been
asked
by
sir
george
lewis
severally
to
give
their
opinions
on
the
act
of
and
all
their
replies
were
published
in
his
weguelin
says
the
amount
of
the
reserve
kept
by
the
bank
of
england
be
contrasted
with
the
reserve
kept
by
the
joint
stock
banks
a
new
and
hitherto
little
considered
source
of
danger
to
the
credit
of
the
country
will
present
itself
the
joint
stock
banks
of
london
judging
by
their
published
accounts
have
deposits
to
the
amount
of
their
capital
is
not
more
than
and
they
have
on
an
average
invested
in
one
way
or
another
leaving
only
as
a
reserve
against
all
this
mass
of
liabilities
but
these
remarkable
words
were
little
observed
in
the
discussions
of
that
time
the
air
was
obscured
by
other
matters
but
in
this
work
i
have
said
so
much
on
the
subject
that
i
need
say
little
now
the
joint
stock
banks
now
keep
a
main
part
of
their
reserve
on
deposit
with
the
or
in
good
and
convertible
securities
from
these
they
obtain
a
large
income
and
that
income
swells
their
profits
if
they
had
to
keep
a
much
larger
part
than
now
of
that
reserve
in
barren
cash
their
dividends
would
be
reduced
and
their
present
success
would
become
less
conspicuous
the
second
misgiving
which
many
calm
observers
more
and
more
feel
as
to
our
largest
joint
stock
banks
fastens
itself
on
their
government
is
that
government
sufficient
to
lend
well
and
keep
safe
so
many
millions
they
are
governed
as
every
one
knows
by
a
board
of
directors
assisted
by
a
general
manager
and
there
are
in
london
unrivalled
materials
for
composing
good
boards
of
directors
there
are
very
many
men
of
good
means
of
great
sagacity
and
great
experience
in
business
who
are
obliged
to
be
in
the
city
every
day
and
to
remain
there
during
the
day
but
who
have
very
much
time
on
their
hands
a
merchant
employing
solely
or
principally
his
own
capital
has
often
a
great
deal
of
leisure
he
is
obliged
to
be
on
the
market
and
to
hear
what
is
doing
every
day
he
has
some
business
to
transact
but
his
transactions
can
be
but
few
his
capital
can
bear
only
a
limited
number
of
purchases
if
he
bought
as
much
as
would
fill
his
time
from
day
to
day
he
would
soon
be
ruined
for
he
could
not
pay
for
it
accordingly
many
excellent
men
of
business
are
quite
ready
to
become
members
of
boards
of
directors
and
to
attend
to
the
business
of
companies
a
good
deal
for
the
employment
sake
to
have
an
interesting
occupation
which
brings
dignity
and
power
with
it
pleases
them
very
much
as
the
aggregation
of
commerce
in
great
cities
grows
the
number
of
such
men
augments
a
council
of
grave
careful
and
experienced
men
can
without
difficulty
be
collected
for
a
great
bank
in
london
such
as
never
could
have
been
collected
before
and
such
as
can
not
now
be
collected
elsewhere
there
are
facilities
too
for
engaging
a
good
banker
to
be
a
manager
such
as
there
never
were
before
in
the
world
the
number
of
such
persons
is
much
on
the
increase
any
careful
person
who
is
experienced
in
figures
and
has
real
sound
sense
may
easily
make
himself
a
good
banker
the
modes
in
which
money
can
be
safely
lent
by
a
banker
are
not
many
and
a
quiet
industrious
person
may
soon
learn
all
that
is
necessary
about
them
our
intricate
law
of
real
property
is
an
impediment
in
country
banking
for
it
requires
some
special
study
even
to
comprehend
the
elements
of
a
law
which
is
full
of
technical
words
and
which
can
only
be
explained
by
narrating
its
history
but
the
banking
of
great
cities
is
little
concerned
with
loans
on
landed
property
and
all
the
rest
of
the
knowledge
requisite
for
a
banker
can
easily
be
obtained
by
anyone
who
has
the
sort
of
mind
which
takes
to
it
no
doubt
there
is
a
vast
routine
of
work
to
be
learned
and
the
manager
of
a
large
bank
must
have
a
great
facility
in
transacting
business
rapidly
but
a
great
number
of
persons
are
now
bred
from
their
earliest
manhood
in
the
very
midst
of
that
routine
they
learn
it
as
they
would
learn
a
language
and
come
to
be
no
more
able
to
unlearn
it
than
they
could
unlearn
a
language
and
the
able
ones
among
them
acquire
an
almost
magical
rapidity
in
effecting
the
business
connected
with
that
routine
a
very
good
manager
and
very
good
board
of
directors
can
without
unreasonable
difficulty
be
provided
for
a
bank
at
present
in
london
it
will
be
asked
what
more
can
be
required
i
reply
a
great
deal
all
which
the
best
board
of
directors
can
really
accomplish
is
to
form
a
good
decision
on
the
points
which
the
manager
presents
to
them
and
perhaps
on
a
few
others
which
one
or
two
zealous
members
of
their
body
may
select
for
discussion
a
meeting
of
fifteen
or
eighteen
persons
is
wholly
unequal
to
the
transaction
of
more
business
than
this
it
will
be
fortunate
and
it
must
be
well
guided
if
it
should
be
found
to
be
equal
to
so
much
the
discussion
even
of
simple
practical
points
by
such
a
number
of
persons
is
a
somewhat
tedious
affair
many
of
them
will
wish
to
speak
on
every
decision
of
moment
and
some
of
them
some
of
the
best
of
them
perhaps
will
only
speak
with
difficulty
and
slowly
very
generally
several
points
will
be
started
at
once
unless
the
discussion
is
strictly
watched
by
a
rigid
chairman
and
even
on
a
single
point
the
arguments
will
often
raise
grave
questions
which
can
not
be
answered
and
suggest
many
more
issues
than
can
be
advantageously
decided
by
the
meeting
the
time
required
by
many
persons
for
discussing
many
questions
would
alone
prevent
an
assembly
of
many
persons
from
overlooking
a
large
and
complicated
business
nor
is
this
the
only
difficulty
not
only
would
a
real
supervision
of
a
large
business
by
a
board
of
directors
require
much
more
time
than
the
board
would
consent
to
occupy
in
meeting
it
would
also
require
much
more
time
and
much
more
thought
than
the
individual
directors
would
consent
to
give
these
directors
are
only
employing
on
the
business
of
the
bank
the
vacant
moments
of
their
time
and
the
spare
energies
of
their
minds
they
can
not
give
the
bank
more
the
rest
is
required
for
the
safe
conduct
of
their
own
affairs
and
if
they
diverted
it
from
these
affairs
they
would
be
ruined
a
few
of
them
may
have
little
other
business
or
they
may
have
other
partners
in
the
business
on
whose
industry
they
can
rely
and
whose
judgment
they
can
trust
one
or
two
may
have
retired
from
business
but
for
the
most
part
directors
of
a
company
can
not
attend
principally
and
anxiously
to
the
affairs
of
a
company
without
so
far
neglecting
their
own
business
as
to
run
great
risk
of
ruin
and
if
they
are
ruined
their
trustworthiness
ceases
and
they
are
no
longer
permitted
by
custom
to
be
directors
nor
even
if
it
were
possible
really
to
supervise
a
business
by
the
effectual
and
constant
inspection
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
rich
and
capable
persons
would
even
the
largest
business
easily
bear
the
expense
of
such
a
supervision
i
say
rich
because
the
members
of
a
board
governing
a
large
bank
must
be
men
of
standing
and
note
besides
or
they
would
discredit
the
bank
they
need
not
be
rich
in
the
sense
of
being
worth
millions
but
they
must
be
known
to
possess
a
fair
amount
of
capital
and
be
seen
to
be
transacting
a
fair
quantity
of
business
but
the
labour
of
such
persons
i
do
not
say
their
spare
powers
but
their
principal
energies
fetches
a
high
price
business
is
really
a
profession
often
requiring
for
its
practice
quite
as
much
knowledge
and
quite
as
much
skill
as
law
and
medicine
and
requiring
also
the
possession
of
money
a
thorough
man
of
business
employing
a
fair
capital
in
a
trade
which
he
thoroughly
comprehends
not
only
earns
a
profit
on
that
capital
but
really
makes
of
his
professional
skill
a
large
income
he
has
a
revenue
from
talent
as
well
as
from
money
and
to
induce
sixteen
or
eighteen
persons
to
abandon
such
a
position
and
such
an
income
in
order
to
devote
their
entire
attention
to
the
affairs
of
a
joint
stock
company
a
salary
must
be
given
too
large
for
the
bank
to
pay
or
for
anyone
to
wish
to
propose
and
an
effectual
supervision
by
the
whole
board
being
impossible
there
is
a
great
risk
that
the
whole
business
may
fall
to
the
general
manager
many
unhappy
cases
have
proved
this
to
be
very
dangerous
even
when
the
business
of
joint
stock
banks
was
far
less
and
when
the
deposits
entrusted
to
them
were
very
much
smaller
a
manager
sometimes
committed
frauds
which
were
dangerous
and
still
oftener
made
mistakes
that
were
ruinous
actual
crime
will
always
be
rare
but
as
an
uninspected
manager
of
a
great
bank
has
the
control
of
untold
millions
sometimes
we
must
expect
to
see
it
the
magnitude
of
the
temptation
will
occasionally
prevail
over
the
feebleness
of
human
nature
but
error
is
far
more
formidable
than
fraud
the
mistakes
of
a
sanguine
manager
are
far
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
theft
of
a
dishonest
manager
easy
misconception
is
far
more
common
than
deceit
and
the
losses
to
which
an
adventurous
and
plausible
manager
in
complete
good
faith
would
readily
commit
a
bank
are
beyond
comparison
greater
than
any
which
a
fraudulent
manager
would
be
able
to
conceal
even
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
if
the
losses
by
mistake
in
banking
and
the
losses
by
fraud
were
put
side
by
side
those
by
mistake
would
be
incomparably
the
greater
there
is
no
more
unsafe
government
for
a
bank
than
that
of
an
eager
and
active
manager
subject
only
to
the
supervision
of
a
numerous
board
of
directors
even
though
that
board
be
excellent
for
the
manager
may
easily
glide
into
dangerous
and
insecure
transactions
nor
can
the
board
effectually
check
him
the
remedy
is
this
a
certain
number
of
the
directors
either
those
who
have
more
spare
time
than
others
or
those
who
are
more
ready
to
sell
a
large
part
of
their
time
to
the
bank
must
be
formed
into
a
real
working
committee
which
must
meet
constantly
must
investigate
every
large
transaction
must
be
acquainted
with
the
means
and
standing
of
every
large
borrower
and
must
be
in
such
incessant
communication
with
the
manager
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
to
engage
in
hazardous
enterprises
of
dangerous
magnitude
without
their
knowing
it
and
having
an
opportunity
of
forbidding
it
in
almost
all
cases
they
would
forbid
it
all
committees
are
cautious
and
a
committee
of
careful
men
of
business
picked
from
a
large
city
will
usually
err
on
the
side
of
caution
if
it
err
at
all
the
daily
attention
of
a
small
but
competent
minor
council
to
whom
most
of
the
powers
of
the
directors
are
delegated
and
who
like
a
cabinet
guide
the
deliberations
of
the
board
at
its
meetings
is
the
only
adequate
security
of
a
large
bank
from
the
rash
engagements
of
a
despotic
and
active
general
manager
fraud
in
the
face
of
such
a
committee
would
probably
never
be
attempted
and
even
now
it
is
a
rare
and
minor
evil
some
such
committees
are
vaguely
known
to
exist
in
most
if
not
all
our
large
joint
stock
banks
but
their
real
constitution
is
not
known
no
customer
and
no
shareholder
knows
the
names
of
the
managing
committee
perhaps
in
any
of
these
large
banks
and
this
is
a
grave
error
a
large
depositor
ought
to
be
able
to
ascertain
who
really
are
the
persons
that
dispose
of
his
money
and
still
more
a
large
shareholder
ought
not
to
rest
till
he
knows
who
it
is
that
makes
engagements
on
his
behalf
and
who
it
is
that
may
ruin
him
if
they
choose
the
committee
ought
to
be
composed
of
quiet
men
of
business
who
can
be
ascertained
by
inquiry
to
be
of
high
character
and
mind
and
if
the
public
and
the
shareholder
knew
that
there
was
such
a
committee
they
would
have
sufficient
reasons
for
the
confidence
which
now
is
given
without
such
reasons
a
certain
number
of
directors
attending
daily
by
rotation
is
it
should
be
said
no
substitute
for
a
permanent
committee
it
has
no
sufficient
responsibility
a
changing
body
can
not
have
any
responsibility
the
transactions
which
were
agreed
to
by
one
set
of
directors
present
on
the
monday
might
be
exactly
those
which
would
be
much
disapproved
by
directors
present
on
the
wednesday
it
is
essential
to
the
decisions
of
most
business
and
not
least
of
the
banking
business
that
they
should
be
made
constantly
by
the
same
persons
the
chain
of
transactions
must
pass
through
the
same
minds
a
large
business
may
be
managed
tolerably
by
a
quiet
group
of
men
if
those
men
be
always
the
same
but
it
can
not
be
managed
at
all
by
a
fluctuating
body
even
of
the
very
cleverest
men
you
might
as
well
attempt
to
guide
the
affairs
of
the
nation
by
means
of
a
cabinet
similarly
changing
our
great
joint
stock
bands
are
imprudent
in
so
carefully
concealing
the
details
of
their
government
and
in
secluding
those
details
from
the
risk
of
discussion
the
answer
no
doubt
will
be
well
alone
as
you
have
admitted
there
hardly
ever
before
was
so
great
a
success
as
these
banks
of
ours
what
more
do
you
or
can
you
want
i
can
only
say
that
i
want
further
to
confirm
this
great
success
and
to
make
it
secure
for
the
future
at
present
there
is
at
least
the
possibility
of
a
great
reaction
supposing
that
owing
to
defects
in
its
government
one
even
of
the
greater
london
joint
stock
banks
failed
there
would
be
an
instant
suspicion
of
the
whole
system
one
being
seen
to
be
faulty
every
other
would
be
suspected
if
the
real
government
of
these
banks
had
for
years
been
known
and
if
the
subsisting
banks
had
been
known
not
to
be
ruled
by
the
bad
mode
of
government
which
had
ruined
the
bank
that
had
fallen
then
the
ruin
of
that
bank
would
not
be
hurtful
the
other
banks
would
be
seen
to
be
exempt
from
the
cause
which
had
destroyed
it
but
at
present
the
ruin
of
one
of
these
great
banks
would
greatly
impair
the
credit
of
all
scarcely
any
one
knows
the
precise
government
of
any
one
in
no
case
has
that
government
been
described
on
authority
and
the
fall
of
one
by
grave
misgovernment
would
be
taken
to
show
that
the
others
might
as
easily
be
misgoverned
also
and
a
tardy
disclosure
even
of
an
admirable
constitution
would
not
much
help
the
surviving
banks
as
it
was
extracted
by
necessity
it
would
be
received
with
suspicion
a
sceptical
world
would
say
course
they
say
they
are
all
perfect
now
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
say
anything
else
and
not
only
the
depositors
and
the
shareholders
of
these
large
banks
have
a
grave
interest
in
their
good
government
but
the
public
also
we
have
seen
that
our
banking
reserve
is
as
compared
with
our
liabilities
singularly
small
we
have
seen
that
the
rise
of
these
great
banks
has
lessened
the
proportion
of
that
reserve
to
those
liabilities
we
have
seen
that
the
greatest
strain
on
the
banking
reserve
is
a
now
no
cause
is
more
capable
of
producing
a
panic
perhaps
none
is
so
capable
as
the
failure
of
a
joint
stock
bank
in
london
such
an
event
would
have
something
like
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
overend
gurney
and
scarcely
any
other
event
would
have
an
equal
effect
and
therefore
under
the
existing
constitution
of
our
banking
system
the
government
of
these
great
banks
is
of
primary
importance
to
us
all
chapter
x
the
private
banks
perhaps
some
readers
of
the
last
part
of
the
last
chapter
have
been
inclined
to
say
that
i
must
be
a
latent
enemy
to
joint
stock
banking
at
any
rate
i
have
pointed
out
what
i
think
grave
defects
in
it

i
fear

a

of
this
chapter
may
on
like
grounds
suppose
that
i
am
an
enemy
to
private
banking
and
i
can
only
hope
that
the
two
impressions
may
counteract
one
another
and
may
show
that
i
do
not
intend
to
be
unfair
i
can
imagine
nothing
better
in
theory
or
more
successful
in
practice
than
private
banks
as
they
were
in
the
beginning
a
man
of
known
wealth
known
integrity
and
known
ability
is
largely
entrusted
with
the
money
of
his
neighbours
the
confidence
is
strictly
personal
his
neighbours
know
him
and
trust
him
because
they
know
him
they
see
daily
his
manner
of
life
and
judge
from
it
that
their
confidence
is
deserved
in
rural
districts
and
in
former
times
it
was
difficult
for
a
man
to
ruin
himself
except
at
the
place
in
which
he
lived
for
the
most
part
he
spent
his
money
there
and
speculated
there
if
he
speculated
at
all
those
who
lived
there
also
would
soon
see
if
he
was
acting
in
a
manner
to
shake
their
confidence
even
in
large
cities
as
cities
then
were
it
was
possible
for
most
persons
to
ascertain
with
fair
certainty
the
real
position
of
conspicuous
persons
and
to
learn
all
which
was
material
in
fixing
their
credit
accordingly
the
bankers
who
for
a
long
series
of
years
passed
successfully
this
strict
and
continual
investigation
became
very
wealthy
and
very
powerful
the
name
banker
had
especially
a
charmed
value
he
was
supposed
to
represent
and
often
did
represent
a
certain
union
of
pecuniary
sagacity
and
educated
refinement
which
was
scarcely
to
be
found
in
any
other
part
of
society
in
a
time
when
the
trading
classes
were
much
ruder
than
they
now
are
many
private
bankers
possessed
variety
of
knowledge
and
a
delicacy
of
attainment
which
would
even
now
be
very
rare
such
a
position
is
indeed
singularly
favourable
the
calling
is
hereditary
the
credit
of
the
bank
descends
from
father
to
son
this
inherited
wealth
soon
begins
inherited
refinement
banking
is
a
watchful
but
not
a
laborious
trade
a
banker
even
in
large
business
can
feel
pretty
sure
that
all
his
transactions
are
sound
and
yet
have
much
spare
mind
a
certain
part
of
his
time
and
a
considerable
part
of
his
thoughts
he
can
readily
devote
to
other
pursuits
and
a
london
banker
can
also
have
the
most
intellectual
society
in
the
world
if
he
chooses
it
there
has
probably
very
rarely
ever
been
so
happy
a
position
as
that
of
a
london
private
banker
and
never
perhaps
a
happier
it
is
painful
to
have
to
doubt
of
the
continuance
of
such
a
class
and
yet
i
fear
we
must
doubt
of
it
the
evidence
of
figures
is
against
it
in
there
were
private
banks
in
lombard
street
admitted
to
the
there
now
are
only
though
the
business
of
banking
has
increased
so
much
since
this
species
of
banks
is
fewer
in
number
than
it
was
then
nor
is
this
the
worst
the
race
is
not
renewed
there
are
not
many
recognised
impossibilities
in
business
but
everybody
admits
you
can
not
found
a
new
private
bank
no
such
has
been
founded
in
london
or
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
country
for
many
years
the
old
ones
merge
or
die
and
so
the
number
is
lessened
but
no
new
ones
begin
so
as
to
increase
that
number
again
the
truth
is
that
the
circumstances
which
originally
favoured
the
establishment
of
private
banks
have
now
almost
passed
away
the
world
has
become
so
large
and
complicated
that
it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain
who
is
rich
and
who
is
poor
no
doubt
there
are
some
enormously
wealthy
men
in
england
whose
means
everybody
has
heard
of
and
has
no
doubt
of
but
these
are
not
the
men
to
incur
the
vast
liabilities
of
private
banking
if
they
were
bred
in
it
they
might
stay
in
it
but
they
would
never
begin
it
for
themselves
and
if
they
did
i
expect
people
would
begin
to
doubt
even
of
their
wealth
it
would
be
said
does
a
b
go
into
banking
for
he
can
not
be
as
rich
as
we
thought
a
millionaire
commonly
shrinks
from
liability
and
the
essence
of
great
banking
is
great
liability
no
doubt
there
are
many
rich
men
as
we
now
count
riches
who
would
be
quite
ready
to
add
to
their
income
the
profit
of
a
private
bank
if
only
they
could
manage
it
but
unluckily
they
can
not
manage
it
their
wealth
is
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
the
world
they
can
not
obtain
the
necessary
confidence
no
new
private
bank
is
founded
in
england
because
men
of
wealth
will
not
found
one
and
men
not
of
absolutely
wealth
can
not
in
the
present
day
also
private
banking
is
exposed
to
a
competition
against
which
in
its
origin
it
had
not
to
struggle
owing
to
the
changes
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
joint
stock
banking
has
begun
to
compete
with
it
in
old
times
this
was
impossible
the
bank
of
england
had
a
monopoly
in
banking
of
the
principle
of
association
but
now
large
joint
stock
banks
of
deposit
are
among
the
most
conspicuous
banks
in
lombard
street
they
have
a
large
capital
and
intelligible
published
accounts
they
use
these
as
an
incessant
advertisement
in
a
manner
in
which
no
individual
can
use
his
own
wealth
by
their
increasing
progress
they
effectually
prevent
the
foundation
of
any
new
private
bank
the
amount
of
the
present
business
of
private
banks
is
perfectly
unknown
their
balance
sheets
are
effective
secrets
rigidly
guarded
but
none
of
them
except
a
few
of
the
largest
are
believed
at
all
to
gain
business
the
common
repute
of
lombard
street
might
be
wrong
in
a
particular
case
but
upon
the
general
doctrine
it
is
almost
sure
to
be
right
there
are
a
few
exceptions
but
according
to
universal
belief
the
deposits
of
most
private
bankers
in
london
tend
rather
to
diminish
than
to
increase
as
to
the
smaller
banks
this
naturally
would
be
so
a
large
bank
always
tends
to
become
larger
and
a
small
one
tends
to
become
smaller
people
naturally
choose
for
their
banker
the
banker
who
has
most
present
credit
and
the
one
who
has
most
money
in
hand
is
the
one
who
possesses
such
credit
this
is
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
a
long
established
and
rich
bank
has
a
opportunity
it
is
in
a
better
position
to
do
its
business
than
any
one
else
is
it
has
a
great
advantage
over
old
competitors
and
an
overwhelming
superiority
over
new
comers
new
people
coming
into
lombard
street
judge
by
results
they
give
to
those
who
have
they
take
their
money
to
the
biggest
bank
because
it
is
the
biggest
i
confess
i
can
not
looking
far
forward
into
the
future
expect
that
the
smaller
private
banks
will
maintain
their
ground
their
old
connections
will
not
leave
them
there
will
be
no
fatal
ruin
no
sudden
mortality
but
the
tide
will
gently
ebb
and
the
course
of
business
will
be
carried
elsewhere
sooner
or
later
appearances
indicate
and
principle
suggests
that
the
business
of
lombard
street
will
be
divided
between
the
joint
stock
banks
and
a
few
large
private
banks
and
then
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
the
question
can
those
large
private
banks
be
permanent
i
am
sure
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
that
they
certainly
can
not
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
be
blind
to
the
grave
difficulties
which
they
must
surmount
in
the
first
place
an
hereditary
business
of
great
magnitude
is
dangerous
the
management
of
such
a
business
needs
more
than
common
industry
and
more
than
common
ability
but
there
is
no
security
at
all
that
these
will
be
regularly
continued
in
each
generation
the
case
of
overend
gurney
and
the
model
instance
of
all
evil
in
business
is
a
most
alarming
example
of
this
evil
no
cleverer
men
of
business
probably
cleverer
i
mean
for
the
purposes
of
their
particular
calling
could
well
be
found
than
the
founders
and
first
managers
of
that
house
but
in
a
very
few
years
the
rule
in
it
passed
to
a
generation
whose
folly
surpassed
the
usual
limit
of
imaginable
incapacity
in
a
short
time
they
substituted
ruin
for
prosperity
and
changed
opulence
into
insolvency
such
great
folly
is
happily
rare
and
the
business
of
a
bank
is
not
nearly
as
difficult
as
the
business
of
a
discount
company
still
much
folly
is
common
and
the
business
of
a
great
bank
requires
a
great
deal
of
ability
and
an
even
rarer
degree
of
trained
and
sober
judgment
that
which
happened
so
marvelously
in
the
green
tree
may
happen
also
in
the
dry
a
great
private
bank
might
easily
become
very
rotten
by
a
change
from
discretion
to
foolishness
in
those
who
conduct
it
we
have
had
as
yet
in
london
happily
no
example
of
this
indeed
we
have
hardly
as
yet
had
the
opportunity
till
now
private
banks
have
been
small
small
as
we
now
reckon
banks
for
their
exigencies
a
moderate
degree
of
ability
and
an
anxious
caution
will
suffice
but
if
the
size
of
the
banks
is
augmented
and
greater
ability
is
required
the
constant
difficulty
of
an
hereditary
government
will
begin
to
be
felt
father
had
great
brains
and
created
the
business
but
the
son
had
less
brains
and
lost
or
lessened
it
this
is
the
history
of
all
great
monarchies
and
it
may
be
the
history
of
great
private
banks
the
peculiarity
in
the
case
of
overend
gurney
and
at
least
one
peculiarity
is
that
the
evil
was
soon
discovered
the
richest
partners
had
least
concern
in
the
management
and
when
they
found
that
incredible
losses
were
ruining
them
they
stopped
the
concern
and
turned
it
into
a
company
but
they
had
done
nothing
if
at
least
they
had
only
prevented
farther
losses
the
firm
might
have
been
in
existence
and
in
the
highest
credit
now
it
was
the
publicity
of
their
losses
which
ruined
them
but
if
they
had
continued
to
be
a
private
partnership
they
need
not
have
disclosed
those
losses
they
might
have
written
them
off
quietly
out
of
the
immense
profits
they
could
have
accumulated
they
had
some
ten
millions
of
other
people
money
in
their
hands
which
no
one
thought
of
disturbing
the
perturbation
through
the
country
which
their
failure
caused
in
the
end
shows
how
diffused
and
how
unimpaired
their
popular
reputation
was
no
one
in
the
rural
districts
as
i
know
by
experience
would
ever
believe
a
word
against
them
say
what
you
might
the
catastrophe
came
because
at
the
change
the
partners
in
the
old
private
firm
the
gurney
family
especially
had
guaranteed
the
new
company
against
the
previous
losses
those
losses
turned
out
to
be
much
greater
than
was
expected
to
pay
what
was
necessary
the
had
to
sell
their
estates
and
their
visible
ruin
destroyed
the
credit
of
the
concern
but
if
there
had
been
no
such
guarantee
and
no
sale
of
estates
if
the
great
losses
had
slept
a
quiet
sleep
in
a
hidden
ledger
no
one
would
have
been
alarmed
and
the
credit
and
the
business
of
might
have
existed
till
now
and
their
name
still
continued
to
be
one
of
our
first
names
the
difficulty
of
propagating
a
good
management
by
inheritance
for
generations
is
greatest
in
private
banks
and
discount
firms
because
of
their
essential
secrecy
the
danger
may
indeed
be
surmounted
by
the
continual
infusion
of
new
and
able
partners
the
deterioration
of
the
old
blood
may
be
compensated
by
the
excellent
quality
of
the
fresh
blood
but
to
this
again
there
is
an
objection
of
little
value
perhaps
in
seeming
but
of
much
real
influence
in
practice
the
infusion
of
new
partners
requires
from
the
old
partners
a
considerable
sacrifice
of
income
the
old
must
give
up
that
which
the
new
receive
and
the
old
will
not
like
this
the
effectual
remedy
is
so
painful
that
i
fear
it
often
may
be
postponed
too
long
i
can
not
therefore
expect
with
certainty
the
continuance
of
our
system
of
private
banking
i
am
sure
that
the
days
of
small
banks
will
before
many
years
come
to
an
end
and
that
the
difficulties
of
large
private
banks
are
very
important
in
the
mean
time
it
is
very
important
that
large
private
banks
should
be
well
managed
and
the
present
state
of
banking
makes
this
peculiarly
difficult
the
detail
of
the
business
is
augmenting
with
an
overwhelming
rapidity
more
cheques
are
drawn
year
by
year
not
only
more
absolutely
but
more
by
each
person
and
more
in
proportion
to
his
income
the
payments
in
and
payments
out
of
a
common
account
are
very
much
more
numerous
than
they
formerly
were
and
this
causes
an
enormous
growth
of
detail
and
besides
bankers
have
of
late
begun
almost
a
new
business
they
now
not
only
keep
people
money
but
also
collect
their
incomes
for
them
many
persons
live
entirely
on
the
income
of
shares
or
debentures
or
foreign
bonds
which
is
paid
in
coupons
and
these
are
handed
in
for
the
bank
to
collect
often
enough
the
debenture
or
the
certificate
or
the
bond
is
in
the
custody
of
the
banker
and
he
is
expected
to
see
when
the
coupon
is
due
and
to
cut
it
off
and
transmit
it
for
payment
and
the
detail
of
all
this
is
incredible
and
it
needs
a
special
machinery
to
cope
with
it
a
large
joint
stock
bank
if
has
that
machinery
it
has
at
the
head
of
the
executive
a
general
manager
who
was
tried
in
the
detail
of
banking
who
is
devoted
to
it
and
who
is
content
to
live
almost
wholly
in
it
he
thinks
of
little
else
and
ought
to
think
of
little
else
one
of
his
first
duties
is
to
form
a
hierarchy
of
inferior
officers
whose
respective
duties
are
defined
and
to
see
that
they
can
perform
and
do
perform
those
duties
but
a
private
bank
of
the
type
usual
in
london
has
no
such
officer
it
is
managed
by
the
partners
now
these
are
generally
rich
men
are
seldom
able
to
grapple
with
great
business
of
detail
and
are
not
disposed
to
spend
their
whole
lives
and
devote
their
entire
minds
to
it
if
they
were
able
a
person
with
the
accumulated
wealth
the
education
and
the
social
place
of
a
great
london
banker
would
be
a
so
to
devote
himself
he
would
sacrifice
a
suitable
and
a
pleasant
life
for
an
unpleasant
and
an
unsuitable
life
but
still
the
detail
must
be
well
done
and
some
one
must
be
specially
chosen
to
watch
it
and
to
preside
over
it
or
it
will
not
be
well
done
until
now
or
until
lately
this
difficulty
has
not
been
fully
felt
the
detail
of
the
business
of
a
small
private
bank
was
moderate
enough
to
be
superintended
effectually
by
the
partners
but
as
has
been
said
the
detail
of
banking
the
proportion
of
detail
to
the
size
of
the
bank
is
everywhere
increasing
the
size
of
the
private
banks
will
have
to
augment
if
private
banks
are
not
to
cease
and
therefore
the
necessity
of
a
good
organisation
for
detail
is
urgent
if
the
bank
grows
and
simultaneously
the
detail
grows
in
proportion
to
the
bank
a
frightful
confusion
is
near
unless
care
be
taken
the
only
organisation
which
i
can
imagine
to
be
effectual
is
that
which
exists
in
the
antagonistic
establishments
the
great
private
banks
will
have
i
believe
to
appoint
in
some
form
or
other
and
under
some
name
or
other
some
species
of
general
manager
who
will
watch
contrive
and
arrange
the
detail
for
them
the
precise
shape
of
the
organisation
is
immaterial
each
bank
may
have
its
own
shape
but
the
man
must
be
there
the
true
business
of
the
private
partners
in
such
a
bank
is
much
that
of
the
directors
in
a
joint
stock
bank
they
should
form
a
permanent
committee
to
consult
with
their
general
manager
to
watch
him
and
to
attend
to
large
loans
and
points
of
principle
they
should
not
themselves
be
responsible
for
detail
if
they
do
there
will
be
two
evils
at
once
the
detail
will
be
done
badly
and
the
minds
of
those
who
ought
to
decide

bad

a

advantage
of

is
that

is
nothing

the

all

that
it

that
in
which
the

is
kept
in
many
banks
or
one
in
which
it
is
kept
in
a
single
bank
only
there
will
always
be
a
class
of
persons
who
examine
more
carefully
than
busy
bankers
can
the
nature
of
different
securities
and
who
by
attending
only
to
one
class
come
to
be
particularly
well
acquainted
with
that
class
and
as
these
specially
qualified
dealers
can
for
the
most
part
lend
much
more
than
their
own
capital
they
will
always
be
ready
to
borrow
largely
from
bankers
and
others
and
to
deposit
the
securities
which
they
know
to
be
good
as
a
pledge
for
the
loan
they
act
thus
as
intermediaries
between
the
borrowing
public
and
the
less
qualified
capitalist
knowing
better
than
the
ordinary
capitalist
which
loans
are
better
and
which
are
worse
they
borrow
from
him
and
gain
a
profit
by
charging
to
the
public
more
than
they
pay
to
him
many
stock
brokers
transact
such
business
upon
a
great
scale
they
lend
large
sums
on
foreign
bonds
or
railway
shares
or
other
such
securities
and
borrow
those
sums
from
bankers
depositing
the
securities
with
the
bankers
and
generally
though
not
always
giving
their
guarantee
but
by
far
the
greatest
of
these
intermediate
dealers
are
the
mercantile
bills
are
an
exceedingly
difficult
kind
of
security
to
understand
the
relative
credit
of
different
merchants
is
a
great
it
is
a
large
mass
of
most
valuable
knowledge
which
has
never
been
described
in
books
and
is
probably
incapable
of
being
so
described
the
subject
matter
of
it
too
is
shifting
and
changing
daily
an
accurate
representation
of
the
trustworthiness
of
houses
at
the
beginning
of
a
year
might
easily
be
a
most
fatal
representation
at
the
end
of
it
in
all
years
there
are
great
changes
some
houses
rise
a
good
deal
and
some
fall
and
in
some
particular
years
the
changes
are
immense
in
years
like
many
active
men
make
so
much
money
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
are
worthy
of
altogether
greater
credit
than
anyone
would
have
dreamed
of
giving
to
them
at
the
beginning
on
the
other
hand
in
years
like
a
contagious
ruin
destroys
the
trustworthiness
of
very
many
firms
and
persons
and
often
especially
of
many
who
stood
highest
immediately
before
such
years
alter
altogether
an
important
part
of
the
mercantile
world
the
final
question
of
bills
will
be
paid
and
which
will
not
which
bills
are
and
which
would
be
answered
very
differently
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
at
the
end
no
one
can
be
a
good
who
has
not
learnt
the
great
mercantile
tradition
of
what
is
called
standing
of
parties
and
who
does
not
watch
personally
and
incessantly
the
inevitable
changes
which
from
hour
to
hour
impair
the
truth
of
that
tradition
the
of
a
person
that
is
the
reliance
which
may
be
placed
on
his
pecuniary
fidelity
is
a
different
thing
from
his
property
no
doubt
other
things
being
equal
a
rich
man
is
more
likely
to
pay
than
a
poor
man
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
men
not
of
much
wealth
who
are
trusted
in
the
market
a
matter
of
business
for
sums
much
exceeding
the
wealth
of
those
who
are
many
times
richer
a
firm
or
a
person
who
have
been
long
known
to
their
engagements
inspire
a
degree
of
confidence
not
dependent
on
the
quantity
of
his
or
their
property
persons
who
buy
to
sell
again
soon
are
often
liable
for
amounts
altogether
much
greater
than
their
own
capital
and
the
power
of
obtaining
those
sums
depends
upon
their
their
and
their
as
the
technical
terms
express
it
and
more
simply
upon
the
opinion
which
those
who
deal
with
them
have
formed
of
them
the
principal
mode
in
which
money
is
raised
by
traders
is
by
of
exchange
the
estimated
certainty
of
their
paying
those
bills
on
the
day
they
fall
due
is
the
measure
of
their
credit
and
those
who
estimate
that
liability
best
the
only
persons
indeed
who
can
estimate
it
exceedingly
well
are
the
and
these
dealers
taking
advantage
of
their
peculiar
knowledge
borrow
immense
sums
from
bankers
and
others
they
generally
deposit
the
bills
as
a
security
and
they
generally
give
their
own
guarantee
of
the
goodness
of
the
bill
but
neither
of
such
practices
indeed
is
essential
though
both
are
the
ordinary
rule
when
overends
failed
as
i
have
said
before
they
had
borrowed
in
this
way
very
largely
there
are
others
now
in
the
trade
who
have
borrowed
quite
as
much
as
is
usually
the
case
this
kind
of
business
has
grown
up
only
gradually
in
the
year
there
was
no
such
business
precisely
answering
to
what
we
now
call
in
london
richardson
the
principal
of
the
time
as
the
term
was
then
understood
thus
described
his
business
to
the
committee
is
the
nature
of
the
agency
for
country
banks
it
is
twofold
in
the
first
place
to
procure
money
for
country
bankers
on
bills
when
they
have
occasion
to
borrow
on
discount
which
is
not
often
the
case
and
in
the
next
place
to
lend
the
money
for
the
country
bankers
on
bills
on
discount
the
sums
of
money
which
i
lend
for
country
bankers
on
discount
are
fifty
times
more
than
the
sums
borrowed
for
country
bankers
you
send
london
bills
into
the
country
for
discount
yes
you
receive
bills
from
the
country
upon
london
in
return
at
a
date
to
be
discounted
yes
to
a
very
considerable
amount
from
particular
parts
of
the
country
not
both
sets
of
bills
by
this
means
under
discount
no
the
bills
received
from
one
part
of
the
country
are
sent
down
to
another
part
for
discount
they
are
not
discounted
in
london
no
in
some
parts
of
the
country
there
is
but
little
circulation
of
bills
drawn
upon
london
as
in
norfolk
suffolk
essex
sussex
but
there
is
there
a
considerable
circulation
in
country
principally
optional
notes
in
lancashire
there
is
little
or
no
circulation
of
country
but
there
is
a
great
circulation
of
bills
drawn
upon
london
at
two
or
three
months
date
i
receive
bills
to
a
considerable
amount
from
lancashire
in
particular
and
remit
them
to
norfolk
suffolk
where
the
bankers
have
large
lodgments
and
much
surplus
money
to
advance
on
bills
for
discount
richardson
was
only
a
broker
who
found
money
for
bills
and
bills
for
money
he
is
further
asked
you
guarantee
the
bills
you
discount
and
what
is
your
charge
per
cent
no
we
do
not
guarantee
them
our
charge
is
per
cent
brokerage
upon
the
bill
discounted
but
we
make
no
charge
to
the
lender
of
the
money
you
consider
that
brokerage
as
a
compensation
for
the
skill
which
you
exercise
in
selecting
the
bills
which
you
thus
get
discounted
yes
for
selecting
of
the
bills
writing
letters
and
other
trouble
the
party
who
furnishes
the
money
give
you
any
kind
of
compensation
none
at
all
he
not
consider
you
as
his
agent
and
in
some
degree
responsible
for
the
safety
of
the
bills
which
you
give
him
not
at
all
he
not
prefer
you
on
the
score
of
his
judging
that
you
will
give
him
good
intelligence
upon
that
subject
yes
he
relies
upon
us
you
then
exercise
a
discretion
as
to
the
probable
safety
of
the
bills
yes
if
a
bill
comes
to
us
which
we
conceive
not
to
be
safe
we
return
it
you
not
then
conceive
yourselves
to
depend
in
a
great
measure
for
the
quantity
of
business
which
you
can
perform
on
the
favour
of
the
party
lending
the
money
yes
very
much
so
if
we
manage
our
business
well
we
retain
our
friends
if
we
do
not
we
lose
them
it
was
natural
enough
that
the
owners
of
the
money
should
not
pay
though
the
owner
of
the
bill
did
for
in
almost
all
ages
the
borrower
has
been
a
seeker
more
or
less
anxious
he
has
always
been
ready
to
pay
for
those
who
will
find
him
the
money
he
is
in
search
of
but
the
possessor
of
money
has
rarely
been
willing
to
pay
anything
he
has
usually
and
rightly
believed
that
the
borrower
would
discover
him
soon
notwithstanding
other
changes
the
distribution
of
the
customers
of
the
in
different
parts
of
the
country
still
remains
much
as
richardson
described
it
sixty
years
ago
for
the
most
part
agricultural
counties
do
not
employ
as
much
money
as
they
save
manufacturing
counties
on
the
other
hand
can
employ
much
more
than
they
save
and
therefore
the
money
of
norfolk
or
of
somersetshire
is
deposited
with
the
london
who
use
it
to
discount
the
bills
of
lancashire
and
yorkshire
the
old
practice
of
which
richardson
describes
also
still
exists
there
are
many
brokers
to
be
seen
about
lombard
street
with
bills
which
they
wish
to
discount
but
which
they
do
not
guarantee
they
have
sometimes
discounted
these
bills
with
their
own
capital
and
if
they
can
them
at
a
slightly
lower
rate
they
gain
a
difference
which
at
first
seems
but
trifling
but
with
which
they
are
quite
content
because
this
system
of
lending
first
and
borrowing
again
immediately
enables
them
to
turn
their
capital
very
frequently
and
on
a
few
thousand
pounds
of
capital
to
discount
hundreds
of
thousands
of
bills
as
the
transactions
are
so
many
they
can
be
content
with
a
smaller
profit
on
each
in
other
cases
these
brokers
are
only
agents
who
are
seeking
money
for
bills
which
they
have
undertaken
to
get
discounted
but
in
either
case
as
far
as
the
banker
or
other
ultimate
capitalist
is
concerned
the
transaction
is
essentially
that
which
richardson
describes
the
loan
by
such
banker
is
a
of
the
bill
that
banker
can
not
obtain
repayment
of
that
loan
except
by
the
payment
of
the
bill
at
maturity
he
has
no
claim
upon
the
agent
who
brought
him
the
bill
in
this
which
we
may
call
its
archaic
form
is
simply
one
of
the
modes
in
which
bankers
obtain
bills
which
are
acceptable
to
them
and
which
they
no
reference
is
made
in
it
to
the
credit
of
the
the
bills
being
discounted
recourse
to
him
are
as
good
if
taken
from
a
pauper
as
if
taken
from
a
millionaire
the
lender
exercises
his
own
judgment
on
the
goodness
of
the
bill
but
in
modern
the
credit
of
the
is
a
vital
element
the
lender
considers
that
the
no
matter
whether
an
individual
a
company
or
a
firm
has
considerable
wealth
and
he
takes
the
relying
that
the
broker
would
not
venture
that
wealth
by
guaranteeing
them
unless
he
thought
them
good
the
lender
thinks
too
that
the
being
daily
conversant
with
bills
and
bills
only
knows
probably
all
about
bills
he
lends
partly
in
reliance
on
the
wealth
of
the
broker
and
partly
in
reliance
on
his
skill
he
does
not
exercise
much
judgment
of
his
own
on
the
bills
deposited
with
him
he
often
does
not
watch
them
very
closely
probably
not
part
of
the
creditors
on
security
of
overend
gurney
and
had
ever
expected
to
have
to
rely
on
that
security
or
had
ever
given
much
real
attention
to
it
sometimes
indeed
the
confidence
in
the
goes
farther
a
considerable
number
of
persons
lend
to
them
not
only
without
much
looking
at
the
security
but
even
without
taking
any
security
this
is
the
exact
reverse
of
the
practice
which
richardson
described
in
then
the
lender
relied
wholly
on
the
goodness
of
the
bill
now
in
these
particular
cases
he
relies
solely
on
the
and
does
not
take
a
bill
in
any
shape
nothing
can
be
more
natural
or
more
inevitable
than
this
change
it
was
certain
that
the
being
supposed
to
understand
bills
well
would
be
asked
by
the
lenders
to
evince
his
reliance
on
the
bills
he
offered
by
giving
a
guarantee
for
them
it
was
also
most
natural
that
the
having
by
the
constant
practice
of
this
lucrative
trade
obtained
high
standing
and
acquired
great
wealth
should
become
more
or
less
bankers
too
and
should
receive
money
on
deposit
without
giving
any
security
for
it
but
the
effects
of
the
change
have
been
very
remarkable
in
the
practice
as
richardson
described
it
there
is
no
peculiarity
very
likely
to
affect
the
money
market
the
brought
bills
to
the
banker
just
as
others
brought
them
nothing
at
all
could
be
said
as
to
it
except
that
the
bank
must
not
discount
bad
bills
must
not
discount
too
many
bills
and
must
keep
a
good
reserve
but
the
modern
practice
introduces
more
complex
considerations
in
the
trade
of
as
it
now
exists
there
is
one
great
difficulty
the
has
to
pay
interest
for
all
the
money
which
he
receives
how
this
arose
we
have
just
seen
the
present
lender
to
the
at
first
always
used
to
discount
a
bill
which
is
as
much
as
saying
that
he
was
always
a
lender
at
interest
when
he
came
to
take
the
guarantee
of
the
broker
and
only
to
look
at
the
bills
as
a
collateral
security
naturally
he
did
not
forego
his
interest
still
less
did
he
forego
it
when
he
ceased
to
take
security
at
all
the
has
in
one
shape
or
other
to
pay
interest
on
every
sixpence
left
with
him
and
that
constant
habit
of
giving
interest
has
this
grave
consequence
the
can
not
afford
to
keep
much
money
unemployed
he
has
become
a
banker
owing
large
sums
which
he
may
be
called
on
to
repay
but
he
can
not
hold
as
much
as
an
ordinary
banker
or
nearly
as
much
of
such
sums
in
cash
because
the
loss
of
interest
would
ruin
him
competition
reduces
the
rate
which
the
can
charge
and
raises
the
rate
which
the
must
give
so
that
he
has
to
live
on
a
difference
exceedingly
narrow
and
if
he
constantly
kept
a
large
hoard
of
barren
money
he
would
soon
be
found
in
the
the
difficulty
is
aggravated
by
the
terms
upon
which
a
great
part
of
the
money
at
the
is
deposited
with
them
very
much
of
it
is
repayable
at
demand
or
at
very
short
notice
the
demands
on
a
broker
in
periods
of
alarm
may
consequently
be
very
great
and
in
practice
they
often
are
so
in
times
of
panic
there
is
always
a
very
heavy
call
if
not
a
run
upon
them
and
in
consequence
of
the
essential
nature
of
their
business
they
can
not
constantly
keep
a
large
unemployed
reserve
of
their
own
in
actual
cash
they
are
obliged
to
ask
help
of
some
one
who
possesses
that
cash
by
the
conditions
of
his
trade
the
is
forced
to
belong
to
a
class
of
as
we
may
term
them
that
is
of
dealers
who
do
not
keep
their
own
reserve
and
must
therefore
at
every
crisis
of
great
difficulty
revert
to
others
in
a
natural
state
of
banking
that
in
which
all
the
principal
banks
kept
their
own
reserve
this
demand
of
the
and
other
dependent
dealers
would
be
one
of
the
principal
calls
on
that
reserve
at
every
period
of
incipient
panic
the
holders
of
it
would
perceive
that
it
was
of
great
importance
to
themselves
to
support
these
dependent
dealers
if
the
panic
destroyed
those
dealers
it
would
grow
by
what
it
fed
upon
as
is
its
nature
and
might
probably
destroy
also
the
bankers
the
holders
of
the
reserve
the
public
terror
at
such
times
is
indiscriminate
when
one
house
of
good
credit
has
perished
other
houses
of
equal
credit
though
of
different
nature
are
in
danger
of
perishing
the
many
holders
of
the
banking
reserve
would
under
the
natural
system
of
banking
be
obliged
to
advance
out
of
that
reserve
to
uphold
and
similar
dealers
it
would
be
essential
to
their
own
preservation
not
to
let
such
dealers
fail
and
the
protection
of
such
dealers
would
therefore
be
reckoned
among
the
necessary
purposes
for
which
they
retained
that
reserve
nor
probably
would
the
demands
on
the
in
such
a
system
of
banking
be
exceedingly
formidable
considerable
sums
would
no
doubt
be
drawn
from
them
but
there
would
be
no
special
reason
why
money
should
be
demanded
from
them
more
than
from
any
other
money
dealers
they
would
share
the
panic
with
the
bankers
who
kept
the
reserve
but
they
would
not
feel
it
more
than
the
bankers
in
each
crisis
the
set
of
the
storm
would
be
determined
by
the
cause
which
had
excited
it
but
there
would
not
be
anything
in
the
nature
of
to
attract
the
advance
of
the
alarm
peculiarly
to
them
they
would
not
be
more
likely
to
suffer
than
other
persons
the
only
difference
would
be
that
when
they
did
suffer
having
no
adequate
reserve
of
their
own
they
would
be
obliged
to
ask
the
aid
of
others
but
under
a
system
of
banking
the
position
of
the
is
much
more
singular
and
much
more
precarious
in
fact
in
lombard
street
the
principal
depositors
of
the
are
the
bankers
whether
of
london
or
of
provincial
england
or
of
scotland
or
ireland
such
deposits
are
in
fact
a
portion
of
the
reserve
of
these
bankers
they
make
an
essential
part
of
the
sums
which
they
have
provided
and
laid
by
against
a
panic
accordingly
in
every
panic
these
sums
are
sure
to
be
called
in
from
the
they
were
wanted
to
be
used
by
their
owners
in
time
of
panic
and
in
time
of
panic
they
ask
for
them
it
may
be
interesting
said
alderman
salomons
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
london
and
westminster
bank
after
the
panic
of
to
the
committee
know
that
on
november
we
held
discounted
bills
for
brokers
to
the
amount
of
out
of
these
bills
matured
between
november
and
december
more
between
december
and
december
consequently
we
were
prepared
merely
by
the
maturing
of
our
bills
of
exchange
for
any
demand
that
might
come
upon
us
this
is
not
indeed
a
direct
withdrawal
of
money
on
deposit
but
its
principal
effect
is
identical
at
the
beginning
of
the
time
the
london
and
westminster
bank
had
lent
more
to
the
than
they
had
at
the
end
of
it
and
that
the
bank
had
added
to
its
reserve
against
a
time
of
difficulty
the
intensity
of
the
demand
on
the
is
aggravated
therefore
by
our
peculiar
system
of
banking
just
at
the
moment
when
by
the
nature
of
their
business
they
have
to
resort
to
the
reserves
of
bankers
for
necessary
support
the
bankers
remove
from
them
large
sums
in
order
to
strengthen
those
reserves
a
great
additional
strain
is
thrown
upon
them
just
at
the
moment
when
they
are
least
able
to
bear
it
and
it
is
thrown
by
those
who
under
a
natural
system
of
banking
would
not
aggravate
the
pressure
on
the
but
relieve
it
and
the
profits
of
are
proportionably
raised
the
reserves
of
the
bankers
so
deposited
with
the
form
a
most
profitable
part
of
his
business
they
are
on
the
whole
of
very
large
amount
and
at
all
times
except
those
of
panic
may
well
be
depended
upon
the
bankers
are
pretty
sure
to
keep
them
there
just
because
they
must
keep
a
reserve
and
they
consider
it
one
of
the
best
places
in
which
to
keep
it
under
a
more
natural
system
no
part
of
the
banking
reserve
would
ever
be
lodged
at
the
brokers
bankers
would
deposit
with
the
brokers
only
their
extra
money
the
money
which
they
considered
they
could
safely
lend
and
which
they
would
not
require
during
a
panic
in
the
eye
of
the
banker
money
at
the
brokers
would
then
be
one
of
the
investments
of
cash
it
would
not
be
a
part
of
such
cash
the
deposits
of
and
the
profits
of
are
increased
by
our
present
system
just
in
proportion
as
the
dangers
of
during
a
panic
are
increased
by
it
the
strain
too
on
our
banking
reserve
which
is
caused
by
the
demands
of
the
is
also
more
dangerous
than
it
would
be
under
a
natural
system
because
that
reserve
is
in
itself
less
the
system
of
keeping
the
entire
ultimate
reserve
at
a
single
bank
undoubtedly
diminishes
the
amount
of
reserve
which
is
kept
and
exactly
on
that
very
account
the
danger
of
any
particular
demand
on
that
reserve
is
augmented
because
the
magnitude
of
the
fund
upon
which
that
demand
falls
is
diminished
so
that
our
system
of
banking
combines
two
evils
first
it
makes
the
demand
of
the
brokers
upon
the
final
reserve
greater
because
under
it
so
many
bankers
remove
so
much
money
from
the
brokers
and
under
it
also
the
final
reserve
is
reduced
to
its
minimum
point
and
the
entire
system
of
credit
is
made
more
delicate
and
more
sensitive
the
peculiarity
indeed
of
the
effects
of
the
one
reserve
is
indeed
even
greater
in
this
respect
under
the
natural
system
the
would
be
in
no
respect
the
rivals
of
the
bankers
which
kept
the
ultimate
reserve
they
would
be
rather
the
agents
for
these
bankers
in
lending
upon
certain
securities
which
they
did
not
themselves
like
or
on
which
they
did
not
feel
competent
to
lend
safely
the
bankers
who
in
time
of
panic
had
to
help
them
would
in
ordinary
times
derive
much
advantage
from
them
but
under
our
present
system
all
this
is
reversed
the
bank
of
england
never
deposits
any
money
with
the
in
ordinary
times
it
never
derives
any
advantage
from
them
on
the
other
hand
as
the
bank
carries
on
itself
a
large
discount
business
as
it
considers
that
it
is
itself
competent
to
lend
on
all
kinds
of
bills
the
are
its
most
formidable
rivals
as
they
constantly
give
high
rates
for
money
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
undersell
the
bank
and
in
ordinary
times
they
do
undersell
it
but
as
the
bank
of
england
alone
keeps
the
final
banking
reserve
the
of
necessity
have
to
resort
to
that
final
reserve
so
that
at
every
panic
and
by
the
essential
constitution
of
the
money
market
the
bank
of
england
has
to
help
has
to
maintain
in
existence
the
dealers
who
never
in
return
help
the
bank
at
any
time
but
who
are
in
ordinary
times
its
closest
competitors
and
its
keenest
rivals
it
might
be
expected
that
such
a
state
of
things
would
cause
much
discontent
at
the
bank
of
england
and
in
matter
of
fact
there
has
been
much
discussion
about
it
and
much
objection
taken
to
it
after
the
panic
of
this
was
so
especially
during
that
panic
the
bank
of
england
advanced
to
the
more
than
though
their
advances
to
bankers
whether
london
or
country
were
only
and
not
unnaturally
the
bank
thought
it
unreasonable
that
so
large
an
inroad
upon
their
resources
should
be
made
by
their
rivals
in
consequence
in
they
made
a
rule
that
they
would
only
advance
to
the
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
when
the
public
money
is
particularly
large
at
the
bank
and
that
at
other
times
any
application
for
an
advance
should
be
considered
exceptional
and
dealt
with
accordingly
and
the
object
of
that
regulation
was
officially
stated
to
be
make
them
keep
their
own
reserve
and
not
to
be
dependent
on
the
bank
of
england
as
might
be
supposed
this
rule
was
exceedingly
unpopular
with
the
brokers
and
the
greatest
of
them
overend
gurney
and
resolved
on
a
strange
policy
in
the
hope
of
abolishing
it
they
thought
they
could
frighten
the
bank
of
england
and
could
show
that
if
they
were
dependent
on
it
it
was
also
dependent
on
them
they
accordingly
accumulated
a
large
deposit
at
the
bank
to
the
amount
of
and
then
withdrew
it
all
at
once
but
this
policy
had
no
effect
except
that
of
exciting
a
distrust
of
the
credit
of
the
bank
of
england
was
not
diminished
overends
had
to
return
the
money
in
a
few
days
and
had
the
dissatisfaction
of
feeling
that
they
had
in
vain
attempted
to
assail
the
solid
basis
of
everyone
credit
and
that
everyone
disliked
them
for
doing
so
but
though
this
attempt
failed
as
it
deserved
the
rule
itself
could
not
be
maintained
the
bank
does
in
fact
at
every
period
of
pressure
advance
to
the
the
case
may
be
considered
but
the
advance
is
always
made
if
the
security
offered
is
really
good
however
much
the
bank
may
dislike
to
aid
their
rivals
yet
they
must
aid
them
at
a
crisis
they
feel
that
they
would
only
be
aggravating
incipient
demand
and
be
augmenting
the
probable
pressure
on
themselves
if
they
refused
to
do
so
i
shall
be
asked
if
this
anomaly
is
inevitable
and
i
am
afraid
that
for
practical
purposes
we
must
consider
it
to
be
so
it
may
be
lessened
the
may
and
should
discourage
as
much
as
they
can
the
deposit
of
money
with
them
on
demand
and
encourage
the
deposit
of
it
at
distant
fixed
dates
or
long
notice
this
will
diminish
the
anomaly
but
it
will
not
cure
it
practically
can
not
refuse
to
receive
money
at
call
in
every
market
a
dealer
must
conduct
his
business
according
to
the
custom
of
the
market
or
he
will
not
be
able
to
conduct
it
at
all
all
the
can
do
is
to
offer
better
rates
for
more
permanent
money
and
this
though
possibly
not
so
much
as
might
be
wished
they
do
at
present
in
its
essence
this
anomaly
is
i
believe
an
inevitable
part
of
the
system
of
banking
which
history
has
given
us
and
which
we
have
only
to
make
the
best
of
since
we
can
not
alter
it
chapter
xii
the
principles
which
should
regulate
the
amount
of
the
banking
reserve
to
be
kept
by
the
bank
of
england
there
is
a
very
common
notion
that
the
amount
of
the
reserve
which
the
bank
of
england
ought
to
keep
can
be
determined
at
once
from
the
face
of
their
weekly
balance
sheet
it
is
imagined
that
you
have
only
to
take
the
liabilities
of
the
banking
department
and
that
a
third
or
some
other
fixed
proportion
will
in
all
cases
be
the
amount
of
reserve
which
the
bank
should
keep
against
those
liabilities
but
to
this
there
are
several
objections
some
arising
from
the
general
nature
of
the
banking
trade
and
others
from
the
special
position
of
the
bank
of
england
that
the
amount
of
the
liabilities
of
a
bank
is
a
principal
element
in
determining
the
proper
amount
of
its
reserve
is
plainly
true
but
that
it
is
the
only
element
by
which
that
amount
is
determined
is
plainly
false
the
intrinsic
nature
of
these
liabilities
must
be
considered
as
well
as
their
numerical
quantity
for
example
no
one
would
say
that
the
same
amount
of
reserve
ought
to
be
kept
against
acceptances
which
can
not
be
paid
except
at
a
certain
day
and
against
deposits
at
call
which
may
be
demanded
at
any
moment
if
a
bank
groups
these
liabilities
together
in
the
you
can
not
tell
the
amount
of
reserve
it
ought
to
keep
the
necessary
information
is
not
given
you
nor
can
you
certainly
determine
the
amount
of
reserve
necessary
to
be
kept
against
deposits
unless
you
know
something
as
to
the
nature
of
these
deposits
if
out
of
of
money
one
depositor
has
to
his
credit
and
may
draw
it
out
when
he
pleases
a
much
larger
reserve
will
be
necessary
against
that
liability
of
than
against
the
remaining
the
intensity
of
the
liability
so
to
say
is
much
greater
and
therefore
the
provision
in
store
must
be
much
greater
also
on
the
other
hand
supposing
that
this
single
depositor
is
one
of
calculable
habits
suppose
that
it
is
a
public
body
the
time
of
whose
demands
is
known
and
the
time
of
whose
receipts
is
known
also
this
single
liability
requires
a
less
reserve
than
that
of
an
equal
amount
of
ordinary
liabilities
the
danger
that
it
will
be
called
for
is
much
less
and
therefore
the
security
taken
against
it
may
be
much
less
too
unless
the
quality
of
the
liabilities
is
considered
as
well
as
their
quantity
the
due
provision
for
their
payment
can
not
be
determined
these
are
general
truths
as
to
all
banks
and
they
have
a
very
particular
application
to
the
bank
of
england
the
first
application
is
favourable
to
the
bank
for
it
shows
the
danger
of
one
of
the
principal
liabilities
to
be
much
smaller
than
it
seems
the
largest
account
at
the
bank
of
england
is
that
of
the
english
government
and
probably
there
has
never
been
any
account
of
which
it
was
so
easy
in
time
of
peace
to
calculate
the
course
all
the
material
facts
relative
to
the
english
revenue
and
the
english
expenditure
are
exceedingly
well
known
and
the
amount
of
the
coming
payments
to
and
from
this
account
are
always
except
in
war
times
to
be
calculated
with
wonderful
accuracy
in
war
no
doubt
this
is
all
reversed
the
account
of
a
government
at
war
is
probably
the
most
uncertain
of
all
accounts
especially
of
a
government
of
a
scattered
empire
like
the
english
whose
places
of
outlay
in
time
of
war
are
so
many
and
so
distant
and
the
amount
of
whose
payments
is
therefore
so
incalculable
ordinarily
however
there
is
no
account
of
which
the
course
can
be
so
easily
predicted
and
therefore
no
account
which
needs
in
ordinary
times
so
little
reserve
the
principal
payments
when
they
are
made
are
also
of
the
most
satisfactory
kind
to
a
banker
they
are
to
a
great
extent
made
to
another
account
at
his
bank
these
largest
ordinary
payments
of
the
government
are
the
dividends
on
the
debt
and
these
are
mostly
made
to
bankers
who
act
as
agents
for
the
creditors
of
the
nation
the
payment
of
the
dividends
for
the
government
is
therefore
in
great
part
a
transfer
from
the
account
of
the
government
to
the
accounts
of
the
various
bankers
a
certain
amount
no
doubt
goes
almost
at
once
to
the
classes
to
those
who
keep
coin
and
notes
in
house
and
have
no
account
at
any
bank
but
even
this
amount
is
calculable
for
it
is
always
nearly
the
same
and
the
entire
operation
is
to
those
who
can
watch
it
singularly
invariable
time
after
time
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
the
published
accounts
of
the
bank
give
no
such
information
to
the
public
as
will
enable
them
to
make
their
own
calculations
the
account
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
is
the
yearly
account
of
the
english
government
what
we
may
call
the
budget
account
that
of
revenue
and
expenditure
and
the
laws
of
this
are
as
we
have
shown
already
known
but
under
the
head
deposits
in
the
accounts
of
the
bank
are
contained
also
other
accounts
and
particularly
that
of
the
secretary
for
india
in
council
the
laws
of
which
must
be
different
and
are
quite
unknown
the
secretary
for
india
is
a
large
lender
on
its
account
if
any
one
proposed
to
give
such
power
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
there
would
be
great
fear
and
outcry
but
so
much
depends
on
habit
and
tradition
that
the
india
office
on
one
side
of
downing
street
can
do
without
remark
and
with
universal
assent
what
it
would
be
thought
and
extravagant
to
propose
that
the
other
side
should
do
the
present
india
office
inherits
this
independence
from
the
old
board
of
the
company
which
being
mercantile
and
used
to
lend
its
own
money
on
the
stock
exchange
as
it
pleased
the
council
of
india
its
successor
retains
the
power
nothing
can
be
better
than
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
do
as
it
likes
but
the
mixing
up
the
account
of
a
body
which
has
such
a
power
and
which
draws
money
from
india
with
that
of
the
home
government
clearly
prevents
the
general
public
from
being
able
to
draw
inferences
as
to
the
course
of
the
combined
account
from
its
knowledge
of
home
finance
only
the
account
of
deposits
in
the
bank
return
includes
other
accounts
too
as
the
savings
bank
balance
the
chancery
funds
account
and
others
and
in
consequence
till
lately
the
public
had
but
little
knowledge
of
the
real
changes
of
the
account
of
our
government
properly
so
called
but
lowe
has
lately
given
us
a
weekly
account
and
from
this
and
not
from
the
bank
account
we
are
able
to
form
a
judgment
this
account
and
the
return
of
the
bank
of
england
it
is
true
unhappily
appear
on
different
days
but
except
for
that
accident
our
knowledge
would
be
perfect
and
as
it
is
for
almost
all
purposes
what
we
know
is
reasonably
sufficient
we
can
now
calculate
the
course
of
the
government
account
nearly
as
well
as
it
is
possible
to
calculate
it
so
far
as
we
have
said
an
analysis
of
the
return
of
the
bank
of
england
is
very
favourable
to
the
bank
so
great
a
reserve
need
not
usually
be
kept
against
the
government
account
as
if
it
were
a
common
account
we
know
the
laws
of
its
changes
peculiarly
well
we
can
tell
when
its
principal
changes
will
happen
with
great
accuracy
and
we
know
that
at
such
changes
most
of
what
is
paid
away
by
the
government
is
only
paid
to
other
depositors
at
the
bank
and
that
it
will
really
stay
at
the
bank
though
under
another
name
if
we
look
to
the
private
deposits
of
the
bank
of
england
at
first
sight
we
may
think
that
the
result
is
the
same
by
far
the
most
important
of
these
are
the
deposits
and
for
the
most
part
these
deposits
as
a
whole
are
likely
to
vary
very
little
each
banker
we
will
suppose
keeps
as
little
as
he
can
but
in
all
domestic
transactions
payment
from
one
is
really
payment
to
the
other
all
the
most
important
transactions
in
the
country
are
settled
by
cheques
these
cheques
are
paid
in
to
the
and
the
balances
resulting
from
them
are
settled
by
transfers
from
the
account
of
one
banker
to
another
at
the
bank
of
england
payments
out
of
the
bankers
balances
therefore
correspond
with
payments
in
as
a
whole
the
deposit
of
the
bankers
balances
at
the
bank
of
england
would
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
a
deposit
singularly
stable
indeed
they
would
seem
so
to
say
to
be
better
than
stable
they
augment
when
everything
else
tends
to
diminish
at
a
panic
when
all
other
deposits
are
likely
to
be
taken
away
the
bankers
deposits
augment
in
fact
they
did
so
in
though
we
do
not
know
the
particulars
and
it
is
natural
that
they
should
so
increase
at
such
moments
all
bankers
are
extremely
anxious
and
they
try
to
strengthen
themselves
by
every
means
in
their
power
they
try
to
have
as
much
money
as
it
is
possible
at
command
they
augment
their
reserve
as
much
as
they
can
and
they
place
that
reserve
at
the
bank
of
england
a
deposit
which
is
not
likely
to
vary
in
ordinary
times
and
which
is
likely
to
augment
in
times
of
danger
seems
in
some
sort
the
model
of
a
deposit
it
might
seem
not
only
that
a
large
proportion
of
it
might
be
lent
but
that
the
whole
of
it
might
be
so
but
a
further
analysis
will
as
i
believe
show
that
this
conclusion
is
entirely
false
that
the
bankers
deposits
are
a
singularly
treacherous
form
of
liability
that
the
utmost
caution
ought
to
be
used
in
dealing
with
them
that
as
a
rule
a
less
proportion
of
them
ought
to
be
lent
than
of
ordinary
deposits
the
easiest
mode
of
explaining
anything
is
usually
to
exemplify
it
by
a
single
actual
case
and
in
this
subject
fortunately
there
is
a
most
conspicuous
case
near
at
hand
the
german
government
has
lately
taken
large
sums
in
bullion
from
this
country
in
part
from
the
bank
of
england
and
in
part
not
according
as
it
chose
it
was
in
the
main
well
advised
and
considerate
in
its
action
and
did
not
take
nearly
as
much
from
the
bank
as
it
might
or
as
would
have
been
dangerous
still
it
took
large
sums
from
the
bank
and
it
might
easily
have
taken
more
how
then
did
the
german
government
obtain
this
vast
power
over
the
bank
the
answer
is
that
it
obtained
it
by
means
of
the
bankers
balances
and
that
it
did
so
in
two
ways
first
the
german
government
had
a
large
balance
of
its
own
lying
at
a
particular
joint
stock
bank
that
bank
lent
this
balance
at
its
own
discretion
to
or
others
and
it
formed
a
single
item
in
the
general
funds
of
the
london
market
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
except
that
it
belonged
to
a
foreign
government
and
that
its
owner
was
always
likely
to
call
it
in
and
sometimes
did
so
as
long
as
it
stayed
unlent
in
the
london
joint
stock
bank
it
increased
the
balances
of
that
bank
at
the
bank
of
england
but
so
soon
as
it
was
lent
say
to
a
it
increased
the
balance
and
as
soon
as
it
was
employed
by
the
in
the
discount
of
bills
the
owners
of
those
bills
paid
it
to
their
credit
at
their
separate
banks
and
it
augmented
the
balances
of
those
bankers
at
the
bank
of
england
of
course
if
it
were
employed
in
the
discount
of
bills
belonging
to
foreigners
the
money
might
be
taken
abroad
and
by
similar
operations
it
might
also
be
transferred
to
the
english
provinces
or
to
scotland
but
as
a
rule
such
money
when
deposited
in
london
for
a
considerable
time
remains
in
london
and
so
long
as
it
does
so
it
swells
the
aggregate
balances
of
the
body
of
bankers
at
the
bank
of
england
it
is
now
in
the
balance
of
one
bank
now
of
another
but
it
is
always
dispersed
about
those
balances
somewhere
the
evident
consequence
is
that
this
part
of
the
bankers
balances
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
german
government
when
it
chooses
to
apply
for
it
supposing
then
the
sum
to
be
three
or
four
millions
and
i
believe
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
the
last
year
or
two
it
has
been
quite
as
much
if
not
more
that
sum
might
at
once
be
withdrawn
from
the
bank
of
england
in
this
case
the
bank
of
england
is
in
the
position
of
a
banker
who
is
liable
for
a
large
amount
to
a
single
customer
but
with
this
addition
that
it
is
liable
for
an
unknown
amount
the
german
government
as
is
well
known
keeps
its
account
and
a
very
valuable
one
it
must
be
at
the
london
joint
stock
bank
but
the
bank
of
england
has
no
access
to
the
account
of
the
german
government
at
that
bank
they
can
not
tell
how
much
german
money
is
lying
to
the
credit
there
nor
can
the
bank
of
england
infer
much
from
the
balance
of
the
london
joint
stock
bank
in
their
bank
for
the
german
money
was
probably
paid
in
various
sums
to
that
bank
and
lent
out
again
in
other
various
sums
it
might
to
some
extent
augment
that
bank
balance
at
the
bank
of
england
or
it
might
not
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
so
much
added
to
that
balance
and
inspection
of
that
bank
balance
would
not
enable
the
bank
of
england
to
determine
even
in
the
vaguest
manner
what
the
entire
sum
was
for
which
it
might
be
asked
at
any
moment
nor
would
the
inspection
of
the
bankers
balances
as
a
whole
lead
to
any
certain
and
sure
conclusions
something
might
be
inferred
from
them
but
not
anything
certain
those
balances
are
no
doubt
in
a
state
of
constant
fluctuation
and
very
possibly
during
the
time
that
the
german
money
was
coming
in
some
other
might
be
going
out
any
sudden
increase
in
the
bankers
balances
would
be
a
probable
indication
of
new
foreign
money
but
new
foreign
money
might
come
in
without
causing
an
increase
since
some
other
and
contemporaneous
cause
might
effect
a
counteracting
decrease
this
is
the
first
and
the
plainest
way
in
which
the
german
government
could
take
and
did
take
money
from
this
country
and
in
which
it
might
have
broken
the
bank
of
england
if
it
had
liked
the
german
government
had
money
here
and
took
it
away
which
is
very
easy
to
understand
but
the
government
also
possessed
a
far
greater
power
of
a
somewhat
more
complex
kind
it
was
the
owner
of
many
debts
from
england
a
large
part
of
the
was
paid
by
france
to
germany
in
bills
on
england
and
the
german
government
as
those
bills
became
due
acquired
an
unprecedented
command
over
the
market
as
each
bill
arrived
at
maturity
the
german
government
could
if
it
chose
take
the
proceeds
abroad
and
it
could
do
so
in
bullion
as
for
coinage
purposes
it
wanted
bullion
this
would
at
first
naturally
cause
a
reduction
in
the
bankers
balances
at
least
that
would
be
its
tendency
supposing
the
german
government
to
hold
bill
a
a
good
bill
the
banker
at
whose
bank
bill
a
was
payable
would
have
to
pay
it
and
that
would
reduce
his
balance
and
as
the
sum
so
paid
would
go
to
germany
it
would
not
appear
to
the
credit
of
any
other
banker
the
aggregate
of
the
bankers
balances
would
thus
be
reduced
but
this
reduction
would
not
be
permanent
a
banker
who
has
to
pay
can
not
afford
to
reduce
his
balance
at
the
bank
of
england
suppose
that
his
liabilities
are
and
that
as
a
rule
he
finds
it
necessary
to
keep
at
the
bank
of
these
liabilities
or
the
payment
of
would
reduce
his
reserve
to
but
his
liabilities
would
be
still
and
therefore
to
keep
up
his
tenth
he
would
have
to
find
his
process
for
finding
it
is
this
he
calls
in
say
a
loan
to
the
and
if
no
equal
additional
money
is
contemporaneously
carried
to
these
brokers
which
in
the
case
of
a
large
withdrawal
of
foreign
money
is
not
probable
they
must
reduce
their
business
and
discount
less
but
the
effect
of
this
is
to
throw
additional
business
on
the
bank
of
england
they
hold
the
ultimate
reserve
of
the
country
and
they
must
discount
out
of
it
if
no
one
else
will
if
they
declined
to
do
so
there
would
be
panic
and
collapse
as
soon
therefore
as
the
withdrawal
of
the
german
money
reduces
the
bankers
balances
there
is
a
new
demand
on
the
bank
for
fresh
discounts
to
make
up
those
balances
the
drain
on
the
bank
is
twofold
first
the
banking
reserve
is
reduced
by
exportation
of
the
german
money
which
reduces
the
means
of
the
bank
of
england
and
then
out
of
those
reduced
means
the
bank
of
england
has
to
make
greater
advances
the
same
result
may
be
arrived
at
more
easily
supposing
any
foreign
government
or
person
to
have
any
sort
of
securities
which
he
can
pledge
in
the
market
that
operation
gives
it
or
him
a
credit
on
some
banker
and
enables
it
or
him
to
take
money
from
the
banking
reserve
at
the
bank
of
england
and
from
the
bankers
balances
and
to
replace
the
bankers
balances
at
their
inevitable
minimum
the
bank
of
england
must
lend
every
sudden
demand
on
the
country
causes
in
proportion
to
its
magnitude
this
peculiar
effect
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
bank
of
england
ought
i
think
to
deal
most
cautiously
and
delicately
with
their
banking
deposits
they
are
the
symbol
of
an
indefinite
liability
by
means
of
them
as
we
see
an
amount
of
money
so
great
that
it
is
impossible
to
assign
a
limit
to
it
might
be
abstracted
from
the
bank
of
england
as
the
bank
of
england
lends
money
to
keep
up
the
bankers
balances
at
their
usual
amount
and
as
by
means
of
that
usual
amount
whatever
sum
foreigners
can
get
credit
for
may
be
taken
from
us
it
is
not
possible
to
assign
a
superior
limit
to
use
the
scientific
word
to
the
demands
which
by
means
of
the
bankers
balances
may
be
made
upon
the
bank
of
england
the
result
comes
round
to
the
simple
point
on
which
this
book
is
a
commentary
the
bank
of
england
by
the
effect
of
a
long
history
holds
the
ultimate
cash
reserve
of
the
country
whatever
cash
the
country
has
to
pay
comes
out
of
that
reserve
and
therefore
the
bank
of
england
has
to
pay
it
and
it
is
as
the
bankers
bank
that
the
bank
of
england
has
to
pay
it
for
it
is
by
being
so
that
it
becomes
the
keeper
of
the
final
cash
reserve
some
persons
have
been
so
much
impressed
with
such
considerations
as
these
that
they
have
contended
that
the
bank
of
england
ought
never
to
lend
the
balances
at
all
that
they
ought
to
keep
them
intact
and
as
an
unused
deposit
i
am
not
sure
indeed
that
i
have
seen
that
extreme
form
of
the
opinion
in
print
but
i
have
often
heard
it
in
lombard
street
from
persons
very
influential
and
very
qualified
to
judge
even
in
print
i
have
seen
close
approximations
to
it
but
i
am
satisfied
that
the
laying
down
such
a
and
fast
rule
would
be
very
dangerous
in
very
important
and
very
changeable
business
rigid
rules
are
apt
to
be
often
dangerous
in
a
panic
as
has
been
said
the
bankers
balances
greatly
augment
it
is
true
the
bank
of
england
has
to
lend
the
money
by
which
they
are
filled
the
banker
calls
in
his
money
from
the
ceases
to
for
that
broker
or
borrows
on
securities
or
sells
securities
and
in
one
or
other
of
these
ways
he
causes
a
new
demand
for
money
which
can
only
at
such
times
be
met
from
the
bank
of
england
every
one
else
is
in
want
too
but
without
inquiring
into
the
origin
of
the
increase
at
panics
the
amount
of
the
deposits
in
fact
increases
very
rapidly
an
immense
amount
of
unused
money
is
at
such
moments
often
poured
by
them
into
the
bank
of
england
and
nothing
can
more
surely
aggravate
the
panic
than
to
forbid
the
bank
of
england
to
lend
that
money
just
when
money
is
most
scarce
you
happen
to
have
an
unusually
large
fund
of
this
particular
species
of
money
and
you
should
lend
it
as
fast
as
you
can
at
such
moments
for
it
is
ready
lending
which
cures
panics
and
or
niggardly
lending
which
aggravates
them
at
other
times
particularly
at
the
quarterly
payment
of
the
dividends
an
absolute
rule
which
laid
down
that
the
balances
were
never
to
be
lent
would
be
productive
of
great
inconvenience
a
large
sum
is
just
then
paid
from
the
government
balance
to
the
bankers
balances
and
if
you
permitted
the
bank
to
lend
it
while
it
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
government
but
forbad
them
to
lend
it
when
it
came
into
the
hands
of
the
bankers
a
great
tilt
upwards
in
the
value
of
money
would
be
the
consequence
for
a
most
important
amount
of
it
would
suddenly
have
become
ineffective
but
the
idea
that
the
bankers
balances
ought
never
to
be
lent
is
only
a
natural
aggravation
of
the
truth
that
these
balances
ought
to
be
used
with
extreme
caution
that
as
they
entail
a
liability
peculiarly
great
and
singularly
difficult
to
foresee
they
ought
never
to
be
used
like
a
common
deposit
it
follows
from
what
has
been
said
that
there
are
always
possible
and
very
heavy
demands
on
the
bank
of
england
which
are
not
shown
in
the
account
of
the
banking
department
at
all
these
demands
may
be
greatest
when
the
liabilities
shown
by
that
account
are
smallest
and
lowest
when
those
liabilities
are
largest
if
for
example
the
german
government
brings
bills
or
other
good
securities
to
this
market
obtains
money
with
them
and
removes
that
money
from
the
market
in
bullion
that
money
may
if
the
german
government
choose
be
taken
wholly
from
the
bank
of
england
if
the
wants
of
the
german
government
be
urgent
and
if
the
amount
of
gold
that
is
the
gold
coming
here
from
the
mining
countries
be
but
small
that
gold
will
be
taken
from
the
bank
of
england
for
there
is
no
other
large
store
in
the
country
the
german
government
is
only
a
conspicuous
example
of
a
foreign
power
which
happens
lately
to
have
had
an
unusual
command
of
good
securities
and
an
unusually
continuous
wish
to
use
them
in
england
any
foreign
state
hereafter
which
wants
cash
will
be
likely
to
come
here
for
it
so
long
as
the
bank
of
france
should
continue
not
to
pay
in
specie
a
foreign
state
which
wants
it
must
of
necessity
come
to
london
for
it
and
no
indication
of
the
likelihood
or
unlikelihood
of
that
want
can
be
found
in
the
books
of
the
bank
of
england
what
is
almost
a
revolution
in
the
policy
of
the
bank
of
england
necessarily
follows
no
certain
or
fixed
proportion
of
its
liabilities
can
in
the
present
times
be
laid
down
as
that
which
the
bank
ought
to
keep
in
reserve
the
old
notion
that
or
any
other
such
fraction
is
in
all
cases
enough
must
be
abandoned
the
probable
demands
upon
the
bank
are
so
various
in
amount
and
so
little
disclosed
by
the
figures
of
the
account
that
no
simple
and
easy
calculation
is
a
sufficient
guide
a
definite
proportion
of
the
liabilities
might
often
be
too
small
for
the
reserve
and
sometimes
too
great
the
forces
of
the
enemy
being
variable
those
of
the
defence
can
not
always
be
the
same
i
admit
that
this
conclusion
is
very
inconvenient
in
past
times
it
has
been
a
great
aid
to
the
bank
and
to
the
public
to
be
able
to
decide
on
the
proper
policy
of
the
bank
from
a
mere
inspection
of
its
account
in
that
way
the
bank
knew
easily
what
to
do
and
the
public
knew
easily
what
to
foresee
but
unhappily
the
rule
which
is
most
simple
is
not
always
the
rule
which
is
most
to
be
relied
upon
the
practical
difficulties
of
life
often
can
not
be
met
by
very
simple
rules
those
dangers
being
complex
and
many
the
rules
for
encountering
them
can
not
well
be
single
or
simple
a
uniform
remedy
for
many
diseases
often
ends
by
killing
the
patient
another
simple
rule
often
laid
down
for
the
management
of
the
bank
of
england
must
now
be
abandoned
also
it
has
been
said
that
the
bank
of
england
should
look
to
the
market
rate
and
make
its
own
rate
conform
to
that
this
rule
was
indeed
always
erroneous
the
first
duty
of
the
bank
of
england
was
to
protect
the
ultimate
cash
of
the
country
and
to
raise
the
rate
of
interest
so
as
to
protect
it
but
this
rule
was
never
so
erroneous
as
now
because
the
number
of
sudden
demands
upon
that
reserve
was
never
formerly
so
great
the
market
rate
of
lombard
street
is
not
influenced
by
those
demands
that
rate
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
deposits
in
the
hands
of
and
bankers
and
the
amount
of
good
bills
and
acceptable
securities
offered
at
the
moment
the
probable
efflux
of
bullion
from
the
bank
scarcely
affects
it
at
all
even
the
real
efflux
affects
it
but
little
if
the
open
market
did
not
believe
that
the
bank
rate
would
be
altered
in
consequence
of
such
effluxes
the
market
rate
would
not
rise
if
the
bank
choose
to
let
its
bullion
go
unheeded
and
is
seen
to
be
going
so
to
choose
the
value
of
money
in
lombard
street
will
remain
unaltered
the
more
numerous
the
demands
on
the
bank
for
bullion
and
the
more
variable
their
magnitude
the
more
dangerous
is
the
rule
that
the
bank
rate
of
discount
should
conform
to
the
market
rate
in
former
quiet
times
the
influence
or
the
partial
influence
of
that
rule
has
often
produced
grave
disasters
in
the
present
difficult
times
an
adherence
to
it
is
a
recipe
for
making
a
large
number
of
panics
a
more
distinct
view
of
abstract
principle
must
be
taken
before
we
can
fix
on
the
amount
of
the
reserve
which
the
bank
of
england
ought
to
keep
why
should
a
bank
keep
any
reserve
because
it
may
be
called
on
to
pay
certain
liabilities
at
once
and
in
a
moment
why
does
any
bank
publish
an
account
in
order
to
satisfy
the
public
that
it
possesses
cash
or
available
securities
enough
to
meet
its
liabilities
the
object
of
publishing
the
account
of
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
is
to
let
the
nation
see
how
the
national
reserve
of
cash
stands
to
assure
the
public
that
there
is
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
meet
not
only
all
probable
calls
but
all
calls
of
which
there
can
be
a
chance
of
reasonable
apprehension
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
publication
of
the
bank
account
gives
more
stability
to
the
money
market
than
any
other
kind
of
precaution
would
give
some
persons
indeed
feared
that
the
opposite
result
would
happen
they
feared
that
the
constant
publication
of
the
incessant
changes
in
the
reserve
would
terrify
and
harass
the
public
mind
an
old
banker
once
told
me
i
was
on
lord
committee
which
decided
on
the
publication
of
the
bank
account
and
i
voted
against
it
i
thought
it
would
frighten
people
but
i
am
bound
to
own
that
the
committee
was
right
and
i
was
wrong
for
that
publication
has
given
the
money
market
a
greater
sense
of
security
than
anything
else
which
has
happened
in
my
time
the
diffusion
of
confidence
through
lombard
street
and
the
world
is
the
object
of
the
publication
of
the
bank
accounts
and
of
the
bank
reserve
but
that
object
is
not
attained
if
the
amount
of
that
reserve
when
so
published
is
not
enough
to
tranquillise
people
a
panic
is
sure
to
be
caused
if
that
reserve
is
from
whatever
cause
exceedingly
low
at
every
moment
there
is
a
certain
minimum
which
i
will
call
the
apprehension
minimum
below
which
the
reserve
can
not
fall
without
great
risk
of
diffused
fear
and
by
this
i
do
not
mean
absolute
panic
but
only
a
vague
fright
and
timorousness
which
spreads
itself
instantly
and
as
if
by
magic
over
the
public
mind
such
seasons
of
incipient
alarm
are
exceedingly
dangerous
because
they
beget
the
calamities
they
dread
what
is
most
feared
at
such
moments
of
susceptibility
is
the
destruction
of
credit
and
if
any
grave
failure
or
bad
event
happens
at
such
moments
the
public
fancy
seizes
on
it
there
is
a
general
run
and
credit
is
suspended
the
bank
reserve
then
never
ought
to
be
diminished
below
the
point
and
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
never
ought
very
closely
to
approach
that
point
since
if
it
gets
very
near
some
accident
may
easily
bring
it
down
to
that
point
and
cause
the
evil
that
is
feared
there
is
no
road
to
the
amount
of
the
minimum
no
abstract
argument
and
no
mathematical
computation
will
teach
it
to
us
and
we
can
not
expect
that
they
should
credit
is
an
opinion
generated
by
circumstances
and
varying
with
those
circumstances
the
state
of
credit
at
any
particular
time
is
a
matter
of
fact
only
to
be
ascertained
like
other
matters
of
fact
it
can
only
be
known
by
trial
and
inquiry
and
in
the
same
way
nothing
but
experience
can
tell
us
what
amount
of
will
create
a
diffused
confidence
on
such
a
subject
there
is
no
way
of
arriving
at
a
just
conclusion
except
by
incessantly
watching
the
public
mind
and
seeing
at
each
juncture
how
it
is
affected
of
course
in
such
a
matter
the
cardinal
rule
to
be
observed
is
that
errors
of
excess
are
innocuous
but
errors
of
defect
are
destructive
too
much
reserve
only
means
a
small
loss
of
profit
but
too
small
a
reserve
may
mean
credit
may
be
at
once
shaken
and
if
some
terrifying
accident
happen
to
supervene
there
may
be
a
run
on
the
banking
department
that
may
be
too
much
for
it
as
in
and
and
may
make
it
unable
to
pay
its
way
without
assistance
as
it
was
in
those
years
and
the
observance
of
this
maxim
is
the
more
necessary
because
the
minimum
is
not
always
the
same
on
the
contrary
in
times
when
the
public
has
recently
seen
the
bank
of
england
exposed
to
remarkable
demands
it
is
likely
to
expect
that
such
demands
may
come
again
conspicuous
and
recent
events
educate
it
so
to
speak
it
expects
that
much
will
be
demanded
when
much
has
of
late
often
been
demanded
and
that
little
will
be
so
when
in
general
but
little
has
been
so
a
bank
like
the
bank
of
england
must
always
therefore
be
on
the
watch
for
a
rise
if
i
may
so
express
it
in
the
apprehension
minimum
it
must
provide
an
adequate
fund
not
only
to
allay
the
misgivings
of
but
also
to
allay
what
may
be
the
still
greater
misgivings
of
and
the
only
practical
mode
of
obtaining
this
object
is
to
keep
the
actual
reserve
always
in
advance
of
the
minimum
reserve
and
this
involves
something
much
more
as
the
actual
reserve
is
never
to
be
less
and
is
always
if
possible
to
exceed
by
a
reasonable
amount
the
apprehension
reserve
it
must
when
the
bank
is
quiet
and
taking
no
precautions
very
considerably
exceed
that
minimum
all
the
precautions
of
the
bank
take
time
to
operate
the
principal
precaution
is
a
rise
in
the
rate
of
discount
and
such
a
rise
certainly
does
attract
money
from
the
continent
and
from
all
the
world
much
faster
than
could
have
been
anticipated
but
it
does
not
act
instantaneously
even
the
right
rate
the
ultimately
attractive
rate
requires
an
interval
for
its
action
and
before
the
money
can
come
here
and
the
right
rate
is
often
not
discovered
for
some
time
it
requires
several
as
the
phrase
goes
several
augmentations
of
the
rate
of
discount
by
the
bank
before
the
really
effectual
rate
is
reached
and
in
the
mean
time
bullion
is
ebbing
away
and
the
is
diminishing
unless
therefore
in
times
without
precaution
the
actual
reserve
exceed
the
minimum
by
at
least
the
amount
which
may
be
taken
away
in
the
inevitable
interval
and
before
the
available
precautions
begin
to
operate
the
rule
prescribed
will
be
infringed
and
the
actual
reserve
will
be
less
than
the
minimum
in
time
the
precautions
taken
may
attract
gold
and
raise
the
reserve
to
the
needful
amount
but
in
the
interim
the
evils
may
happen
against
which
the
rule
was
devised
diffused
apprehension
may
arise
and
then
any
unlucky
accident
may
cause
many
calamities
i
may
be
asked
does
all
this
reasoning
in
practice
come
to
at
the
present
moment
how
much
reserve
do
you
say
the
bank
of
england
should
keep
state
your
recommendation
clearly
i
know
it
will
be
said
if
you
wish
to
have
it
attended
to
and
i
will
answer
the
question
plainly
though
in
so
doing
there
is
a
great
risk
that
the
principles
i
advocate
may
be
in
some
degree
injured
through
some
mistake
i
may
make
in
applying
them
i
should
say
that
at
the
present
time
the
mind
of
the
monetary
world
would
become
feverish
and
fearful
if
the
reserve
in
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
went
below
estimated
by
the
idea
of
old
times
by
the
idea
even
of
ten
years
ago
that
sum
i
know
sounds
extremely
large
my
own
nerves
were
educated
to
smaller
figures
because
i
was
trained
in
times
when
the
demands
on
us
were
less
when
neither
was
so
much
reserve
wanted
nor
did
the
public
expect
so
much
but
i
judge
from
such
observations
as
i
can
make
of
the
present
state
of
men
minds
that
in
fact
and
whether
justifiably
or
not
the
important
and
intelligent
part
of
the
public
which
watches
the
bank
reserve
becomes
anxious
and
dissatisfied
if
that
reserve
falls
below
that
sum
therefore
i
call
the
minimum
for
the
present
times
circumstances
may
change
and
may
make
it
less
or
more
but
according
to
the
most
careful
estimate
i
can
make
that
is
what
i
should
call
it
now
it
will
be
said
that
this
estimate
is
arbitrary
and
these
figures
are
conjectures
i
reply
that
i
only
submit
them
for
the
judgment
of
others
the
main
question
is
one
of
fact
does
not
the
public
mind
begin
to
be
anxious
and
timorous
just
where
i
have
placed
the
apprehension
point
and
the
deductions
from
that
are
comparatively
simple
questions
of
mixed
fact
and
reasoning
the
final
appeal
in
such
cases
necessarily
is
to
those
who
are
conversant
with
and
who
closely
watch
the
facts
i
shall
perhaps
be
told
also
that
a
body
like
the
court
of
the
directors
of
the
bank
of
england
can
not
act
on
estimates
like
these
that
such
a
body
must
have
a
plain
rule
and
keep
to
it
i
say
in
reply
that
if
the
correct
framing
of
such
estimates
is
necessary
for
the
good
guidance
of
the
bank
we
must
make
a
governing
body
which
can
correctly
frame
such
estimates
we
must
not
suffer
from
a
dangerous
policy
because
we
have
inherited
an
imperfect
form
of
administration
i
have
before
explained
in
what
manner
the
government
of
the
bank
of
england
should
i
consider
be
strengthened
and
that
government
so
strengthened
would
i
believe
be
altogether
competent
to
a
wise
policy
then
i
should
say
putting
the
foregoing
reasoning
into
figures
that
the
bank
ought
never
to
keep
less
than
or
since
experience
shows
that
a
million
or
a
million
and
a
half
may
be
taken
from
us
at
any
time
i
should
regard
this
as
the
practical
minimum
at
which
roughly
of
course
the
bank
should
aim
and
which
it
should
try
never
to
be
below
and
in
order
not
to
be
below
the
bank
must
begin
to
take
precautions
when
the
reserve
is
between
and
for
experience
shows
that
between
and
may
probably
enough
be
withdrawn
from
the
bank
store
before
the
right
rate
of
interest
is
found
which
will
attract
money
from
abroad
and
before
that
rate
has
had
time
to
attract
it
when
the
reserve
is
between
and
and
when
it
begins
to
be
diminished
by
foreign
demand
the
bank
of
england
should
i
think
begin
to
act
and
to
raise
the
rate
of
interest
chapter
xiii
conclusion
i
know
it
will
be
said
that
in
this
work
i
have
pointed
out
a
deep
malady
and
only
suggested
a
superficial
remedy
i
have
tediously
insisted
that
the
natural
system
of
banking
is
that
of
many
banks
keeping
their
own
cash
reserve
with
the
penalty
of
failure
before
them
if
they
neglect
it
i
have
shown
that
our
system
is
that
of
a
single
bank
keeping
the
whole
reserve
under
no
effectual
penalty
of
failure
and
yet
i
propose
to
retain
that
system
and
only
attempt
to
mend
and
palliate
it
i
can
only
reply
that
i
propose
to
retain
this
system
because
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
of
no
manner
of
use
proposing
to
alter
it
a
system
of
credit
which
has
slowly
grown
up
as
years
went
on
which
has
suited
itself
to
the
course
of
business
which
has
forced
itself
on
the
habits
of
men
will
not
be
altered
because
theorists
disapprove
of
it
or
because
books
are
written
against
it
you
might
as
well
or
better
try
to
alter
the
english
monarchy
and
substitute
a
republic
as
to
alter
the
present
constitution
of
the
english
money
market
founded
on
the
bank
of
england
and
substitute
for
it
a
system
in
which
each
bank
shall
keep
its
own
reserve
there
is
no
force
to
be
found
adequate
to
so
vast
a
reconstruction
and
so
vast
a
destructions
and
therefore
it
is
useless
proposing
them
no
one
who
has
not
long
considered
the
subject
can
have
a
notion
how
much
this
dependence
on
the
bank
of
england
is
fixed
in
our
national
habits
i
have
given
so
many
illustrations
in
this
book
that
i
fear
i
must
have
exhausted
my
reader
patience
but
i
will
risk
giving
another
i
suppose
almost
everyone
thinks
that
our
system
of
savings
banks
is
sound
and
good
almost
everyone
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
there
is
any
possible
objection
to
it
yet
see
what
it
amounts
to
by
the
last
return
the
savings
banks
the
old
and
the
post
office
together
contain
about
of
deposits
and
against
this
they
hold
in
the
funds
securities
of
the
best
kind
but
they
hold
no
cash
whatever
they
have
of
course
the
petty
cash
about
the
various
branches
necessary
for
daily
work
but
of
cash
in
ultimate
reserve
cash
in
reserve
against
a
panic
the
savings
banks
have
not
a
sixpence
these
banks
depend
on
being
able
in
a
panic
to
realise
their
securities
but
it
has
been
shown
over
and
over
again
that
in
a
panic
such
securities
can
only
be
realised
by
the
help
of
the
bank
of
england
that
it
is
only
the
bank
with
the
ultimate
cash
reserve
which
has
at
such
moments
any
new
money
or
any
power
to
lend
and
act
if
in
a
general
panic
there
were
a
run
on
the
banks
those
banks
could
not
sell
of
consols
without
the
help
of
the
bank
of
england
not
holding
themselves
a
cash
reserve
for
times
of
panic
they
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
one
bank
which
does
hold
that
reserve
this
is
only
a
single
additional
instance
beyond
the
innumerable
ones
given
which
shows
how
deeply
our
system
of
banking
is
fixed
in
our
ways
of
thinking
the
government
keeps
the
money
of
the
poor
upon
it
and
the
nation
fully
approves
of
their
doing
so
no
one
hears
a
syllable
of
objection
and
every
practical
man
every
man
who
knows
the
scene
of
action
will
agree
that
our
system
of
banking
based
on
a
single
reserve
in
the
bank
of
england
can
not
be
altered
or
a
system
of
many
banks
each
keeping
its
own
reserve
be
substituted
for
it
nothing
but
a
revolution
would
effect
it
and
there
is
nothing
to
cause
a
revolution
this
being
so
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
the
best
of
our
banking
system
and
to
work
it
in
the
best
way
that
it
is
capable
of
we
can
only
use
palliatives
and
the
point
is
to
get
the
best
palliative
we
can
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
why
it
seems
to
me
that
the
palliatives
which
i
have
suggested
are
the
best
that
are
at
our
disposal
i
have
explained
why
the
french
plan
will
not
suit
our
english
world
the
direct
appointment
of
the
governor
and
of
the
bank
of
england
by
the
executive
government
would
not
lessen
our
evils
or
help
our
difficulties
i
fear
it
would
rather
make
both
worse
but
possibly
it
may
be
suggested
that
i
ought
to
explain
why
the
american
system
or
some
modification
would
not
or
might
not
be
suitable
to
us
the
american
law
says
that
each
national
bank
shall
have
a
fixed
proportion
of
cash
to
its
liabilities
there
are
two
classes
of
banks
and
two
different
proportions
but
that
is
not
to
the
present
purpose
and
it
ascertains
by
inspectors
who
inspect
at
their
own
times
whether
the
required
amount
of
cash
is
in
the
bank
or
not
it
may
be
asked
could
nothing
like
this
be
attempted
in
england
could
not
it
or
some
modification
help
us
out
of
our
difficulties
as
far
as
the
american
banking
system
is
one
of
many
reserves
i
have
said
why
i
think
it
is
of
no
use
considering
whether
we
should
adopt
it
or
not
we
can
not
adopt
it
if
we
would
the
system
is
fixed
upon
us
the
only
practical
imitation
of
the
american
system
would
be
to
enact
that
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
should
always
keep
a
fixed
proportion
say
of
its
liabilities
in
reserve
but
as
we
have
seen
before
a
fixed
proportion
of
the
liabilities
even
when
that
proportion
is
voluntarily
chosen
by
the
directors
and
not
imposed
by
law
is
not
the
proper
standard
for
a
bank
reserve
liabilities
may
be
imminent
or
distant
and
a
fixed
rule
which
imposes
the
same
reserve
for
both
will
sometimes
err
by
excess
and
sometimes
by
defect
it
will
waste
profits
by
against
ordinary
danger
and
yet
it
may
not
always
save
the
bank
for
this
provision
is
often
likely
enough
to
be
insufficient
against
rare
and
unusual
dangers
but
bad
as
is
this
system
when
voluntarily
chosen
it
becomes
far
worse
when
legally
and
compulsorily
imposed
in
a
sensitive
state
of
the
english
money
market
the
near
approach
to
the
legal
limit
of
reserve
would
be
a
sure
incentive
to
panic
if
were
fixed
by
law
the
moment
the
banks
were
close
to
alarm
would
begin
and
would
run
like
magic
and
the
fear
would
be
worse
because
it
would
not
be
unfounded
at
least
not
wholly
if
you
say
that
the
bank
shall
always
hold
of
its
liabilities
as
a
reserve
you
say
in
fact
that
this
shall
always
be
useless
for
out
of
it
the
bank
can
not
make
advances
can
not
give
extra
help
can
not
do
what
we
have
seen
the
holders
of
the
ultimate
reserve
ought
to
do
and
must
do
there
is
no
help
for
us
in
the
american
system
its
very
essence
and
principle
are
faulty
we
must
therefore
i
think
have
recourse
to
feeble
and
humble
palliatives
such
as
i
have
suggested
with
good
sense
good
judgment
and
good
care
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
may
be
enough
but
i
have
written
in
vain
if
i
require
to
say
now
that
the
problem
is
delicate
that
the
solution
is
varying
and
difficult
and
that
the
result
is
inestimable
to
us
all
appendix
note
a
liabilities
and
cash
reserve
of
the
chief
banking
systems
the
following
is
a
comparison
of
the
liabilities
to
the
public
and
of
the
cash
reserve
of
the
banking
systems
of
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
and
the
united
states
for
the
united
kingdom
the
figures
are
the
most
defective
as
they
only
include
the
deposits
of
the
bank
of
england
and
of
the
london
joint
stock
banks
and
the
banking
reserve
of
the
bank
of
england
which
is
the
only
cash
available
against
these
liabilities
is
also
the
only
cash
reserve
against
the
similar
liabilities
of
the
london
private
banks
the
provincial
english
banks
and
the
scotch
and
irish
banks
in
the
case
of
england
therefore
the
method
of

exhibits
a

note
b
extract
from
evidence
given
by
alderman
salomons
before
house
of
commons
select
committee
in
chairman
the
effect
upon
yourselves
of
the
pressure
in
november
was
i
presume
to
induce
you
to
increase
your
reserve
in
your
own
hands
and
also
to
increase
your
deposits
with
the
bank
of
england
yes
that
was
so
but
i
wish
to
tell
the
committee
that
that
was
done
almost
entirely
by
allowing
the
bills
of
exchange
which
we
held
to
mature
and
not
by
raising
any
money
or
curtailing
our
accommodation
to
our
customers
perhaps
it
may
be
interesting
to
the
committee
to
know
that
on
the
of
november
we
held
discounted
bills
for
brokers
to
the
amount
of
out
of
those
bills
matured
between
the
of
november
and
the
of
december
and
more
between
the
of
december
and
the
so
that
about
of
bills
matured
between
the
of
november
and
the
of
december
consequently
we
were
prepared
merely
by
the
maturing
of
our
bills
of
exchange
for
any
demands
that
might
possibly
come
upon
us
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
did
not
withdraw
your
usual
accommodation
from
your
own
customers
but
that
you
ceased
to
have
in
deposit
with
the
so
large
a
sum
of
money
as
you
had
before
not
exactly
that
the
bills
which
we
had
discounted
were
allowed
to
mature
and
we
discounted
less
we
kept
a
large
reserve
of
cash
that
is
to
say
you
withdrew
from
the
commercial
world
a
part
of
that
accommodation
which
you
had
previously
given
and
at
the
same
time
you
increased
your
deposits
with
the
bank
of
england
yes
our
deposits
with
the
bank
of
england
were
increased
we
did
not
otherwise
withdraw
accommodation
mr
weguelin
had
you
any
money
at
call
with
the
a
small
amount
perhaps
about
or
less
which
we
did
not
call
in
chairman
what
i
understand
you
to
say
is
that
the
effect
of
the
commercial
pressure
upon
you
was
to
induce
you
upon
the
whole
to
withdraw
from
commerce
an
amount
of
accommodation
which
in
other
times
you
had
given
and
at
the
same
time
to
increase
your
deposits
with
the
bank
of
england
so
far
only
as
ceasing
to
discount
with
strangers
persons
not
having
current
accounts
with
us
or
to
give
the
same
amount
to
the
for
a
while
instead
of
discounting
for
brokers
and
strangers
we
allowed
our
bills
to
mature
and
remained
quiescent
with
a
view
to
enable
us
to
meet
any
demand
that
might
be
made
on
ourselves
except
what
you
felt
bound
to
your
own
customers
to
continue
to
give
you
ceased
to
make
advances
quite
so
perhaps
i
might
say
at
the
same
time
that
besides
a
large
balance
which
we
kept
at
the
bank
of
england
which
of
course
was
as
available
as
in
our
own
tills
we
increased
our
notes
in
our
tills
at
the
head
office
and
at
all
the
branches
i
suppose
at
that
time
large
sales
of
public
securities
were
made
by
the
london
joint
stock
banks
which
securities
were
purchased
by
the
public
it
is
understood
that
some
joint
stock
and
other
banks
sold
but
i
believe
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
public
purchased
largely
because
they
always
purchase
when
the
funds
fall
are
you
prepared
to
give
the
committee
any
opinion
of
your
own
as
to
the
effect
one
way
or
the
other
which
the
system
of
the
joint
stock
banks
may
have
produced
with
regard
to
aggravating
or
diminishing
the
commercial
pressure
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
i
should
state
generally
that
the
joint
stock
banks
as
well
as
all
other
banks
in
london
by
collecting
money
from
those
who
had
it
to
spare
must
of
necessity
have
assisted
and
could
not
do
otherwise
than
assist
commerce
both
then
and
at
all
other
times
you
say
that
your
discounts
either
at
your
own
counter
or
through
the
are
ordinarily
very
large
but
that
at
the
time
of
severest
pressure
you
contracted
them
so
far
as
you
thought
was
just
to
your
own
immediate
customers
yes
but
the
capital
was
still
there
because
it
was
at
the
bank
of
england
and
it
was
capable
of
being
used
for
short
periods
if
we
did
not
want
it
others
might
have
used
it
mr
weguelin
in
fact
it
was
used
by
the
bank
of
england
undoubtedly
i
should
suppose
so
there
is
no
question
about
it
you
of
course
felt
quite
certain
that
your
deposits
in
the
bank
of
england
might
be
had
upon
demand
we
had
no
doubt
about
it
you
did
not
take
into
consideration
the
effect
of
the
law
of
which
might
have
placed
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
in
such
a
position
as
not
to
be
able
to
meet
the
demands
of
its
depositors
i
must
say
that
that
never
gave
us
the
smallest
concern
you
therefore
considered
that
if
the
time
should
arrive
the
government
would
interfere
with
some
measure
as
they
had
previously
done
to
enable
the
bank
to
meet
the
demands
upon
it
we
should
always
have
thought
that
if
the
bank
of
england
had
stopped
payment
all
the
machinery
of
government
would
have
stopped
with
it
and
we
never
could
have
believed
that
so
formidable
a
calamity
would
have
arisen
if
the
government
could
have
prevented
it
chairman
the
notion
of
the
convertibility
of
the
note
being
in
danger
never
crossed
your
mind
never
for
a
moment
nothing
of
the
kind
mr
weguelin
i
refer
not
to
the
convertibility
of
the
note
but
to
the
state
of
the
banking
department
of
the
bank
of
england
if
we
had
thought
that
there
was
any
doubt
whatever
about
it
we
should
have
taken
our
and
put
them
in
our
own
strong
chest
we
could
never
for
a
moment
believe
an
event
of
that
kind
as
likely
to
happen
therefore
you
think
that
the
measure
taken
by
the
government
of
issuing
a
letter
authorising
the
bank
of
england
to
increase
their
issues
of
notes
upon
securities
was
what
was
generally
expected
by
the
commercial
world
and
what
in
future
the
commercial
world
would
look
to
in
such
a
conjunction
of
circumstances
we
looked
for
some
measure
of
that
nature
that
no
doubt
was
the
most
obvious
one
we
had
great
doubts
whether
it
would
come
when
it
did
until
the
very
last
moment
have
you
ever
contemplated
the
possibility
of
the
bank
refusing
to
advance
under
circumstances
similar
to
those
which
existed
in
november
upon
good
banking
securities
of
course
i
have
and
it
is
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
as
to
what
its
effect
might
be
but
the
notion
appears
to
me
to
be
so
thoroughly
ingrained
in
the
minds
of
the
commercial
world
that
whenever
you
have
good
security
it
ought
to
be
convertible
at
the
bank
in
some
shape
or
way
that
i
have
very
great
doubt
indeed
whether
the
bank
can
ever
take
a
position
to
refuse
to
assist
persons
who
have
good
commercial
securities
to
offer
mr
cayley
when
you
say
that
you
have
come
to
some
fresh
arrangement
with
regard
to
your
allowance
of
interest
upon
deposits
do
you
speak
of
yourselves
as
the
london
and
westminster
bank
or
of
some
of
the
other
banks
in
combination
with
yourselves
i
think
all
the
banks
have
come
to
an
understanding
that
it
is
not
desirable
either
for
their
proprietors
or
for
the
public
to
follow
closely
at
all
times
the
alterations
of
the
bank
i
believe
it
is
understood
amongst
them
all
that
they
do
not
intend
following
that
course
in
future
is
that
from
a
feeling
that
it
is
rather
dangerous
under
particular
circumstances
i
can
not
admit
as
to
its
being
dangerous
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
this
that
there
is
a
notion
in
the
public
mind
which
we
ought
not
to
contend
against
that
when
you
offer
a
high
rate
of
interest
for
money
you
rather
do
it
because
you
want
the
person
money
than
because
you
are
obeying
the
market
rate
and
i
think
it
is
desirable
that
we
should
show
that
if
persons
wish
to
employ
their
money
and
want
an
excessive
rate
they
may
take
it
away
and
employ
it
themselves
you
think
that
there
is
now
a
general
understanding
amongst
the
banks
which
you
have
mentioned
to
act
upon
a
different
principle
from
that
on
which
they
acted
during
last
october
and
november
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
know
that
to
be
the
case
was
not
it
the
fact
that
this
system
of
giving
so
high
a
rate
of
interest
upon
money
at
call
commenced
very
much
with
the
establishment
of
some
banks
during
the
last
year
or
two
which
instead
of
demanding
days
or
a
month
notice
were
willing
to
allow
interest
upon
only
three
days
notice
did
not
that
system
begin
about
two
years
ago
i
do
not
think
it
began
with
the
new
banks
i
think
it
began
with
one
of
the
older
banks
i
know
that
as
regards
my
own
bank
that
we
were
forced
into
it
i
forgot
to
say
that
with
regard
to
ourselves
in
taking
money
on
deposit
the
parties
must
leave
the
money
a
month
or
they
lose
interest
we
do
not
take
money
from
any
depositor
at
interest
unless
upon
the
understanding
and
condition
that
it
remains
a
month
with
us
he
may
withdraw
it
within
the
month
but
then
he
forfeits
interest
it
will
not
carry
interest
unless
it
is
with
us
a
month
and
then
it
is
removable
on
demand
without
notice
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
fact
that
some
of
the
banks
pay
interest
upon
their
current
accounts
yes
i
think
most
of
the
new
banks
do
so
and
the
union
bank
of
london
does
it
at
a
smaller
rate
than
upon
their
deposits
i
presume
i
think
at
a
smaller
rate
but
i
believe
it
is
a
fixed
rate
on
the
minimum
balance
for
some
period
either
six
months
or
one
month
i
do
not
exactly
know
the
period
i
think
i
ought
to
add
and
i
believe
it
is
the
case
with
all
the
banks
that
the
london
and
westminster
bank
from
the
day
of
its
first
institution
until
the
present
day
has
never
a
bill
no
bill
has
ever
left
our
bank
unless
it
has
been
for
payment
is
not
that
generally
the
case
with
the
london
joint
stock
banks
i
believe
it
is
the
case
mr
weguelin
but
you
sometimes
lend
money
upon
bills
deposited
with
you
by
yes
and
you
occasionally
call
in
that
money
and
those
securities
yes
but
that
we
do
to
a
very
small
extent
is
not
that
equivalent
to
a
of
bills
no
the
discount
of
a
bill
and
the
lending
money
on
bills
are
very
different
things
when
we
discount
a
bill
that
bill
becomes
our
property
it
is
in
our
control
and
we
keep
it
and
lock
it
up
until
it
falls
due
but
when
brokers
come
to
us
and
want
to
borrow
say
on
a
deposit
of
bills
and
we
let
them
have
the
money
and
afterwards
return
those
bills
to
them
and
we
get
back
our
money
surely
that
is
not
a
when
you
want
to
employ
your
money
for
a
short
period
do
you
not
frequently
take
bills
of
long
date
and
advance
upon
them
but
that
is
not
a
on
our
part
very
often
brokers
in
borrowing
money
send
in
bills
of
long
date
and
afterwards
we
call
in
that
loan
but
that
is
no
more
a
than
lending
money
upon
consols
and
calling
in
that
money
again
it
is
not
an
advance
of
ours
we
do
not
seek
it
they
come
to
us
and
borrow
our
money
and
give
us
a
security
when
we
want
our
money
we
call
for
that
money
and
return
their
security
surely
that
is
not
a
mr
hankey
is
there
not
this
clear
distinction
between
returning
a
bill
on
which
you
have
made
an
advance
and
discounting
a
bill
that
if
you
have
discounted
a
bill
your
liability
continues
upon
the
bill
until
that
bill
has
come
to
maturity
yes
in
the
other
case
you
have
no
further
liability
whatever
certainly
should
you
not
consider
that
a
very
important
distinction
i
think
it
is
an
important
distinction
take
this
case
suppose
a
party
comes
to
us
and
borrows
and
we
lend
it
him
and
when
the
loan
becomes
due
we
take
our
money
back
again
surely
that
is
not
a
discount
on
our
part
is
there
not
this
distinction
that
if
you
you
may
go
on
pledging
the
liability
of
your
bank
to
an
almost
unlimited
amount
whereas
in
the
other
case
you
only
get
back
that
money
which
you
have
lent
undoubtedly
mr
cayley
the
late
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
stated
before
the
adjournment
in
a
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
that
during
the
monday
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
of
the
panic
the
bank
was
almost
if
not
entirely
the
only
body
that
discounted
commercial
bills
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
what
you
have
said
that
you
gave
as
much
accommodation
as
usual
to
your
customers
i
am
not
responsible
for
what
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
said
i
am
responsible
for
what
i
am
now
stating
as
to
the
course
of
our
bank
that
our
advances
to
our
customers
on
the
of
december
were
nearly
higher
than
they
were
on
the
of
october
with
regard
to
our
not
discounting
for
other
parties
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
discredit
which
prevailed
that
it
was
necessary
we
should
hold
a
portion
of
our
deposits
in
order
that
they
should
be
available
in
case
persons
called
for
them
a
certain
number
of
persons
did
so
in
the
month
of
november
we
had
a
reduction
of
our
deposits
and
if
we
had
gone
on
discounting
for
brokers
we
should
have
had
to
go
into
the
market
ourselves
to
raise
money
on
our
government
securities
but
we
avoided
that
by
not
discounting
and
leaving
our
money
at
the
bank
of
england
then
you
did
not
discount
as
much
as
usual
for
your
customers
during
that
period
yes
we
did
and
more
but
not
to
strangers
not
to
strangers
i
make
a
distinction
between
our
transactions
with
our
customers
who
of
course
expect
us
to
give
accommodation
and
discounts
for
brokers
which
is
entirely
voluntary
depending
upon
our
having
money
to
employ
how
would
it
have
been
if
the
letter
had
not
issued
at
the
last
moment
that
is
a
question
which
i
can
hardly
answer
what
do
you
mean
by
that
general
expression
of
yours
it
is
impossible
to
predicate
what
may
happen
in
time
of
panic
and
alarm
a
great
alarm
prevailed
certainly
amongst
the
commercial
world
and
it
could
never
have
been
alleviated
except
by
some
extraordinary
means
of
relief
we
might
probably
have
been
in
the
state
in
which
hamburg
was
where
they
have
no
in
circulation
mr
spooner
what
did
you
mean
by
the
expression
last
moment
you
said
that
the
letter
came
out
at
the
last
moment
the
last
moment
of
what
it
was
late
in
the
day
it
was
a
day
of
great
distress
for
two
days
there
was
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
everybody
expected
that
there
would
be
some
relief
and
it
was
when
expectation
i
suppose
was
highly
excited
that
the
letter
came
and
it
gave
relief
can
not
you
tell
us
what
your
opinion
would
have
been
if
that
last
moment
had
happened
to
have
elapsed
and
the
letter
had
not
come
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
it
is
too
much
to
say
that
it
could
not
have
been
got
over
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
what
created
the
difficulty
existed
out
of
london
and
not
in
it
and
therefore
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
give
an
opinion
i
believe
that
the
banking
interest
both
private
and
joint
stock
was
in
a
perfectly
sound
condition
and
able
to
bear
any
strain
which
might
have
been
brought
upon
it
in
london
mr
hankey
can
you
give
the
committee
any
idea
as
to
what
proportion
of
deposits
you
consider
generally
desirable
to
keep
in
reserve
you
must
be
very
much
guided
by
circumstances
in
times
of
alarm
when
there
are
failures
of
course
all
bankers
strengthen
their
reserves
our
reserve
then
is
larger
in
times
of
ordinary
business
we
find
both
as
regards
our
deposits
at
interest
as
well
as
those
which
are
not
at
interest
that
there
is
a
constant
circulation
that
the
receipts
of
money
very
nearly
meet
the
payments
you
probably
keep
at
all
times
a
certain
amount
of
your
deposits
totally
unemployed
in
reserve
yes
in
a
normal
state
of
commercial
affairs
is
there
any
fixed
proportion
or
can
you
give
the
committee
any
idea
of
what
you
would
consider
about
a
fair
and
desirable
proportion
which
should
be
so
kept
unemployed
i
think
the
best
idea
which
i
can
give
upon
that
subject
is
to
give
our
annual
statement
or
balance
sheet
for
the
of
december
does
that
show
what
amount
of
unemployed
money
you
had
on
that
day
yes
i
will
put
in
a
statement
which
perhaps
will
be
the
best
means
of
meeting
the
question
showing
the
cash
in
hand
on
the
of
june
and
the
of
december
in
every
year
as
shown
by
our
published
accounts
together
with
our
money
at
call
and
our
government
securities
that
will
be
perhaps
the
best
and
most
convenient
way
of
giving
the
information
you
desire
to
have
see
table
below
do
you
consider
that
when
your
deposits
are
materially
on
the
increase
it
is
necessary
to
keep
a
larger
amount
of
money
in
reserve
than
you
would
keep
at
other
times
i
may
say
that
as
a
general
rule
our
reserve
would
always
bear
some
proportion
to
our
deposits
lodgments
with
london

yes

commercial

i
should

generally
not
we

or
two

whom
we

have
not
accounts
with
us

generally
we
do
not

for
our
customers

for
do
you
consider
that
any
advantage
can
arise
to
the
public
by
the
bank
of
england
advancing
to
a
greater
extent
than
can
be
considered
strictly
prudent
on
the
soundest
principle
of
banking
under
the
idea
of
their
affording
aid
to
the
commercial
world
as
i
said
before
as
long
as
there
are
good
bills
in
circulation
that
is
bills
about
which
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
their
being
paid
at
maturity
there
should
be
some
means
by
which
those
bills
could
be
discounted
and
do
you
think
that
it
is
part
of
the
functions
of
the
bank
of
england
to
discount
a
bill
for
anybody
merely
because
the
party
holding
the
bill
wishes
to
convert
it
into
cash
as
i
said
before
the
bank
of
england
will
have
great
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
that
inconvenient
idea
which
there
is
in
the
mind
of
the
public
that
the
bank
of
england
is
something
more
than
an
ordinary
joint
stock
bank
i
think
it
must
depend
very
much
upon
circumstances
whether
you
can
or
can
not
refuse
the
discount
of
good
bills
which
are
offered
to
you
note
statement
of
circulation
and
deposits
of
the
bank
of
dundee

of

and

l
the
bank
did
not
begin
to
receive
deposits
until
in
which
year
they
amounted
to
note
meeting
of
the
proprietors
of
the
bank
of
england
september
from
september
a
general
court
of
the
bank
of
england
was
held
at
the
bank
at
twelve
on
the
instant
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
a
dividend
for
the
past
launcelot
holland
the
governor
of
the
bank
who
presided
upon
the
occasion
addressed
the
proprietors
as
follows
this
is
one
of
the
quarterly
general
courts
appointed
by
our
charter
and
it
is
also
one
of
our
general
courts
held
under
our
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
a
dividend
from
a
statement
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
it
appears
that
the
net
profits
of
the
bank
for
the
ending
on
the
of
august
last
amounted
to
making
the
amount
of
the
rest
on
that
day
and
after
providing
for
a
dividend
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
the
rest
will
stand
at
the
court
of
directors
therefore
propose
that
a
dividend
of
interest
and
profits
to
the
amount
of
per
cent
without
deduction
on
account
of
income
tax
shall
be
made
on
the
of
october
next
that
is
the
proposal
i
have
now
to
lay
before
the
general
court
but
as
important
events
have
occurred
since
we
last
met
i
think
it
right
i
should
briefly
advert
to
them
upon
this
occasion
a
great
strain
has
within
the
last
few
months
been
put
upon
the
resources
of
this
house
and
of
the
whole
banking
community
of
london
and
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
say
that
not
only
this
house
but
the
entire
banking
body
acquitted
themselves
most
honourably
and
creditably
throughout
that
very
trying
period
banking
is
a
very
peculiar
business
and
it
depends
so
much
upon
credit
that
the
least
blast
of
suspicion
is
sufficient
to
sweep
away
as
it
were
the
harvest
of
a
whole
year
but
the
manner
in
which
the
banking
establishments
generally
of
london
met
the
demands
made
upon
them
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
past
affords
a
most
satisfactory
proof
of
the
soundness
of
the
principles
on
which
their
business
is
conducted
this
house
exerted
itself
to
the
utmost
and
exerted
itself
most
successfully
to
meet
the
crisis
we
did
not
flinch
from
our
post
when
the
storm
came
upon
us
on
the
morning
on
which
it
became
known
that
the
house
of
overend
and
had
failed
we
were
in
as
sound
and
healthy
a
position
as
any
banking
establishment
could
hold
and
on
that
day
and
throughout
the
succeeding
week
we
made
advances
which
would
hardly
be
credited
i
do
not
believe
that
any
one
would
have
thought
of
predicting
even
at
the
shortest
period
beforehand
the
greatness
of
those
advances
it
was
not
unnatural
that
in
this
state
of
things
a
certain
degree
of
alarm
should
have
taken
possession
of
the
public
mind
and
that
those
who
required
accommodation
from
the
bank
should
have
gone
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
requested
the
government
to
empower
us
to
issue
notes
beyond
the
statutory
amount
if
we
should
think
that
such
a
measure
was
desirable
but
we
had
to
act
before
we
could
receive
any
such
power
and
before
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
was
perhaps
out
of
his
bed
we
had
advanced
of
our
reserves
which
were
certainly
thus
reduced
to
an
amount
which
we
could
not
witness
without
regret
but
we
could
not
flinch
from
the
duty
which
we
conceived
was
imposed
upon
us
of
supporting
the
banking
community
and
i
am
not
aware
that
any
legitimate
application
for
assistance
made
to
this
house
was
refused
every
gentleman
who
came
here
with
adequate
security
was
liberally
dealt
with
and
if
accommodation
could
not
be
afforded
to
the
full
extent
which
was
demanded
no
one
who
offered
proper
security
failed
to
obtain
relief
from
this
house
i
have
perhaps
gone
a
little
more
into
details
than
is
customary
upon
these
occasions
but
the
times
have
been
unusually
interesting
and
i
thought
it
desirable
to
say
this
much
in
justification
of
the
course
adopted
by
this
house
of
running
its
balances
down
to
a
point
which
some
gentlemen
may
consider
dangerous
looking
back
however
upon
recent
events
i
can
not
take
any
blame
to
this
court
for
not
having
been
prepared
for
such
a
tornado
as
that
which
burst
upon
us
on
the
of
may
and
i
hope
the
court
of
proprietors
will
feel
that
their
directors
acted
properly
upon
that
occasion
and
that
they
did
their
best
to
meet
a
very
extraordinary
state
of
circumstances
i
have
now
only
to
move
that
a
dividend
be
declared
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
for
the
past
hyam
said
that
before
the
question
was
put
he
wished
to
offer
a
few
observations
to
the
court
he
believed
that
the
statement
of
accounts
which
had
just
been
laid
before
them
was
perfectly
satisfactory
he
also
thought
that
the
directors
had
done
their
best
to
assist
the
commercial
classes
throughout
the
late
monetary
crisis
but
it
appeared
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
in
fault
in
not
having
applied
at
an
earlier
period
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
for
a
suspension
of
the
bank
act
it
was
well
known
that
the
demand
on
the
bank
was
materially
lessened
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
in
consequence
of
a
rumour
which
had
been
extensively
circulated
that
permission
to
overstep
the
limits
laid
down
in
the
act
had
been
granted
that
concession
however
had
only
been
made
after
the
most
urgent
representations
had
been
addressed
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
at
a
late
hour
in
the
night
and
if
it
had
then
been
refused
he
felt
persuaded
that
the
state
of
affairs
would
have
been
much
worse
on
the
saturday
than
it
had
been
on
the
friday
the
fact
was
that
the
act
of
was
totally
unsuited
to
the
present
requirements
of
the
country
which
since
that
period
had
tripled
or
quadrupled
its
commerce
and
he
was
sorry
to
know
that
the
measure
seemed
to
meet
with
the
approval
of
many
of
their
directors
any
one
who
read
the
speeches
made
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
on
watkins
motion
must
see
that
the
subject
called
for
further
inquiry
and
he
trusted
that
the
demand
for
that
inquiry
would
yet
be
conceded
jones
said
he
entirely
dissented
from
the
views
with
respect
to
the
bank
act
entertained
by
the
hon
proprietor
who
had
just
addressed
the
court
in
his
opinion
the
main
cause
of
the
recent
monetary
crisis
was
that
while
we
had
bought
worth
of
foreign
produce
in
the
year
the
value
of
our
exports
had
only
been
so
that
we
had
a
balance
against
us
to
the
amount
of
he
believed
that
the
bank
acted
wisely
in
resisting
every
attempt
to
increase
the
paper
currency
and
he
felt
convinced
that
the
working
classes
would
be
the
people
least
likely
to
benefit
by
the
rise
in
prices
which
would
take
place
under
such
a
change
moxon
said
he
should
be
glad
to
know
what
was
the
amount
of
bad
debts
made
by
the
bank
during
the
past
it
was
stated
very
confidently
out
of
doors
that
during
that
period
the
directors
had
between
and
of
bills
returned
to
them
the
governor
of
the
may
i
ask
what
is
your
authority
for
that
statement
we
are
rather
amused
at
hearing
it
and
we
have
never
been
able
to
trace
any
rumour
of
the
kind
to
an
authentic
source
moxon
continued
whether
the
bad
debts
were
large
or
small
he
thought
it
was
desirable
that
they
should
all
know
what
was
their
actual
amount
they
had
been
told
at
their
last
meeting
that
the
bank
held
a
great
many
railway
debentures
and
he
should
like
to
know
whether
any
of
those
debentures
came
from
railway
companies
that
had
since
been
unable
to
meet
their
obligations
he
understood
that
a
portion
of
their
property
was
locked
up
in
advances
made
on
account
of
the
thames
embankment
and
in
other
ways
which
did
not
leave
the
money
available
for
general
banking
and
commercial
purposes
and
if
that
were
so
he
should
express
his
disapproval
of
such
a
policy
there
was
another
important
point
to
which
he
wished
to
advert
he
was
anxious
to
know
what
was
the
aggregate
balance
of
the
joint
stock
banks
in
the
bank
of
england
he
feared
that
some
time
or
other
the
joint
stock
banks
would
be
in
a
position
to
command
perhaps
the
stoppage
of
the
bank
of
england
if
that
were
not
so
the
sooner
the
public
were
full
informed
upon
the
point
the
better
but
if
ten
or
twelve
joint
stock
banks
had
large
balances
in
the
bank
of
england
and
if
the
bank
balances
were
to
run
very
low
people
would
naturally
begin
to
suspect
that
the
joint
stock
banks
had
more
power
over
the
bank
of
england
than
they
ought
to
have
he
wished
further
to
ask
whether
the
directors
had
of
late
taken
into
consideration
the
expediency
of
paying
interest
on
deposits
he
believed
that
under
their
present
mode
of
carrying
on
their
business
they
were
foregoing
large
profits
which
they
might
receive
with
advantage
to
themselves
and
to
the
public
and
he
would
recommend
that
they
should
undertake
the
custody
of
securities
after
the
system
adopted
by
the
bank
of
france
in
conclusion
he
proposed
to
move
three
resolutions
for
the
purpose
of
providing
first
that
a
list
of
all
the
proprietors
of
bank
stock
should
be
printed
with
a
separate
entry
of
the
names
of
all
those
persons
not
entitled
to
vote
from
the
smallness
of
their
stock
or
from
the
shortness
of
time
during
which
they
held
it
secondly
that
a
copy
of
the
charter
of
the
bank
with
the
rules
orders
and
passed
for
the
good
government
of
their
corporation
should
be
printed
for
the
use
of
the
shareholders
and
thirdly
that
auditors
should
be
appointed
to
make
detailed
audits
of
their
accounts
gerstenberg
recommended
that
the
directors
should
take
some
step
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
spread
of
such
erroneous
notions
as
that
which
lately
prevailed
on
the
continent
that
the
bank
was
about
to
suspend
specie
payments
botly
said
he
wished
to
see
the
directors
taking
into
their
consideration
the
expediency
of
allowing
interest
on
deposits
alderman
salomons
said
he
wished
to
take
that
opportunity
of
stating
that
he
believed
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
to
the
managers
and
shareholders
of
joint
stock
banks
than
the
testimony
which
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
had
that
day
borne
to
the
sound
and
honourable
manner
in
which
their
business
was
conducted
it
was
mainfestly
desirable
that
the
joint
stock
banks
and
the
banking
interest
generally
should
work
in
harmony
with
the
bank
of
england
and
he
sincerely
thanked
the
governor
of
the
bank
for
the
kindly
manner
in
which
he
had
alluded
to
the
mode
in
which
the
joint
stock
banks
had
met
the
late
monetary
crisis
the
governor
of
the
bank
said
before
putting
the
question
for
the
declaration
of
a
dividend
i
wish
to
refer
to
one
or
two
points
that
have
been
raised
by
the
gentlemen
who
have
addressed
the
court
on
this
occasion
the
most
prominent
topic
brought
under
our
notice
is
the
expediency
of
allowing
interest
on
deposits
and
upon
that
point
i
must
say
that
i
believe
a
more
dangerous
innovation
could
not
be
made
in
the
practice
of
the
bank
of
england
the
downfall
of
overend
and
gurney
and
of
many
other
houses
must
be
traced
to
the
policy
which
they
adopted
of
paying
interest
on
deposits
at
call
while
they
were
themselves
tempted
to
invest
the
money
so
received
in
speculations
in
ireland
or
in
america
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
where
it
was
not
available
when
a
moment
of
pressure
arrived
botly
said
he
did
not
mean
deposits
on
call
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
continued
that
is
only
a
matter
of
detail
the
main
question
is
whether
we
ought
to
pay
interest
on
deposits
and
of
such
policy
i
must
express
my
entire
disapproval
moxon
has
referred
to
the
amount
of
our
debts
but
as
i
stated
when
i
took
the
liberty
of
interrupting
him
we
could
never
trace
the
origin
of
any
rumour
which
prevailed
upon
that
subject
as
far
as
it
can
be
said
to
have
ever
existed
it
had
its
origin
most
probably
in
the
vast
amount
advanced
by
the
bank
it
must
however
be
remembered
that
we
did
not
make
our
advances
without
ample
security
and
the
best
proof
of
that
is
the
marvelously
small
amount
of
bad
debts
which
we
contracted
it
has
never
been
a
feature
of
the
bank
to
state
what
was
the
precise
amount
of
those
debts
but
i
believe
that
if
i
were
to
mention
it
upon
the
present
occasion
it
would
be
found
to
be
so
inconsiderable
that
i
should
hardly
obtain
credence
for
the
announcement
i
should
have
to
make
i
am
convinced
that
our
present
dividend
has
been
as
honestly
and
as
hardly
earned
as
any
that
we
have
ever
realised
but
it
has
been
obtained
by
means
of
great
vigilance
and
great
anxiety
on
the
part
of
each
and
all
of
your
directors
and
i
will
add
that
i
believe
you
would
only
diminish
their
sense
of
responsibility
and
introduce
confusion
into
the
management
of
your
business
if
you
were
to
transfer
to
auditors
the
making
up
of
your
accounts
if
your
directors
deserve
your
confidence
they
are
surely
capable
of
performing
that
duty
and
if
they
do
not
deserve
it
you
ought
not
to
continue
them
in
their
present
office
with
regard
to
the
supposed
of
our
capital
i
must
observe
that
with
on
our
hands
we
must
necessarily
invest
it
in
a
variety
of
securities
but
there
is
no
ground
for
imagining
that
our
money
is
locked
up
and
is
not
available
for
the
purpose
of
making
commercial
advances
we
advanced
in
the
space
of
three
months
the
sum
of
and
what
more
than
that
do
you
want
it
has
been
recommended
that
we
should
take
charge
of
securities
but
we
have
found
it
necessary
to
refuse
all
securities
except
those
of
our
customers
and
i
believe
the
custody
of
securities
is
becoming
a
growing
evil
with
regard
to
railway
debentures
i
do
not
believe
we
have
one
of
a
doubtful
character
we
have
no
debentures
except
those
of
railway
companies
and
companies
which
we
know
are
acting
within
their
parliamentary
limits
having
alluded
to
those
subjects
i
will
now
put
the
motion
for
the
declaration
of
the
dividend
the
motion
was
accordingly
put
and
unanimously
adopted
the
chairman
then
announced
that
that
resolution
should
be
confirmed
by
ballot
on
tuesday
next
inasmuch
as
the
bank
could
not
under
the
provisions
of
its
act
of
parliament
declare
otherwise
than
in
that
form
a
dividend
higher
than
that
which
it
had
distributed
during
the
preceding
the
three
resolutions
proposed
by
moxon
were
then
read
but
they
were
not
put
to
the
meeting
inasmuch
as
they
found
no
seconders
alderman
salomons
said
that
their
governor
had
observed
that
he
thought
the
payment
of
interests
on
deposits
was
objectionable
and
everyone
must
see
that
such
a
practice
ought
not
to
be
adopted
by
the
bank
of
england
but
he
took
it
for
granted
that
the
governor
did
not
mean
that
his
statement
should
apply
to
joint
stock
banks
which
he
had
himself
told
them
had
conducted
their
business
so
creditably
and
so
successfully
the
governor
of
the
bank
said
that
what
he
stated
was
that
such
a
system
would
be
dangerous
for
the
bank
of
england
and
dangerous
if
carried
into
effect
in
the
way
contemplated
by
moxon
laurie
said
he
understood
the
governor
of
the
bank
to
say
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
take
deposits
on
call
and
in
that
opinion
he
concurred
alderman
salomons
said
that
he
too
was
of
the
same
opinion
on
the
motion
of
alderman
salomons
seconded
by
botly
a
vote
of
thanks
was
passed
to
the
governor
and
the
directors
for
their
able
and
successful
management
of
the
bank
during
the
past
and
the
proceedings
then
terminated
