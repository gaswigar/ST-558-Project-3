novick
a
short
novel
the
planet
savers
zimmer
bradley
has
written
some
of
the
finest
science
fiction
in
print
she
has
been
away
from
our
pages
too
long
so
this
story
is
in
the
nature
of
a
triumphant
return
it
could
well
be
her
best
to
by
the
time
i
got
myself
all
the
way
awake
i
thought
i
was
alone
i
was
lying
on
a
leather
couch
in
a
bare
white
room
with
huge
windows
alternate
and
clear
glass
beyond
the
clear
windows
was
a
view
of
mountains
which
turned
to
pale
shadows
in
the
habit
and
memory
fitted
names
to
all
these
the
bare
office
the
orange
flare
of
the
great
sun
the
names
of
the
dimming
mountains
but
beyond
a
polished
glass
desk
a
man
sat
watching
me
and
i
had
never
seen
the
man
before
he
was
chubby
and
not
young
and
had
eyebrows
and
a
fringe
of
hair
around
the
edges
of
a
forehead
which
was
otherwise
quite
pink
and
bald
he
was
wearing
a
white
uniform
coat
and
the
intertwined
caduceus
on
the
pocket
and
on
the
sleeve
proclaimed
him
a
member
of
the
medical
service
attached
to
the
civilian
hq
of
the
terran
trade
city
i
did
stop
to
make
all
these
evaluations
consciously
of
course
they
were
just
part
of
my
world
when
i
woke
up
and
found
it
taking
shape
around
me
the
familiar
mountains
the
familiar
sun
the
strange
man
but
he
spoke
to
me
in
a
friendly
way
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
thing
to
find
a
perfect
stranger
sprawled
out
taking
a
siesta
in
here
could
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me
your
name
that
was
reasonable
enough
if
i
found
somebody
making
himself
at
home
in
my
office
if
i
had
an
office
i
ask
him
his
name
too
i
started
to
swing
my
legs
to
the
floor
and
had
to
stop
and
steady
myself
with
one
hand
while
the
room
drifted
in
giddy
circles
around
me
illustration
the
man
in
the
mirror
was
a
stranger
i
would
try
to
sit
up
just
yet
he
remarked
while
the
floor
calmed
down
again
then
he
repeated
politely
but
insistently
your
name
oh
yes
my
name
it
was
i
fumbled
through
layers
of
what
felt
like
gray
fuzz
trying
to
lay
my
tongue
on
the
most
familiar
of
all
sounds
my
own
name
it
was
why
it
was
i
said
on
a
high
rising
note
this
is
damn
silly
and
swallowed
and
swallowed
again
hard
calm
down
the
chubby
man
said
soothingly
that
was
easier
said
than
done
i
stared
at
him
in
growing
panic
and
demanded
but
but
have
i
had
amnesia
or
something
or
something
what
my
now
now
take
it
easy
i
sure
you
remember
it
soon
enough
you
can
answer
other
questions
i
sure
how
old
are
you
i
answered
eagerly
and
quickly
the
chubby
man
scribbled
something
on
a
card
interesting
do
you
know
where
we
are
i
looked
around
the
office
in
the
terran
headquarters
from
your
uniform
i
say
we
were
on
floor
medical
he
nodded
and
scribbled
again
pursing
his
lips
can
you
uh
tell
me
what
planet
we
are
on
i
had
to
laugh
darkover
i
chuckled
i
hope
and
if
you
want
the
names
of
the
moons
or
the
date
of
the
founding
of
the
trade
city
or
something
he
gave
in
laughing
with
me
remember
where
you
were
born
on
samarra
i
came
here
when
i
was
three
years
old
my
father
was
in
mapping
and
exploring
i
stopped
short
in
shock
he
dead
can
you
tell
me
your
father
name
same
as
mine
jay
jason
the
flash
of
memory
closed
down
in
the
middle
of
a
word
it
had
been
a
good
try
but
it
had
quite
worked
the
doctor
said
soothingly
we
doing
very
well
you
have
told
me
anything
i
accused
who
are
you
why
are
you
asking
me
all
these
questions
he
pointed
to
a
sign
on
his
desk
i
scowled
and
spelled
out
the
letters
randall
forth
director
department
and
dr
forth
made
a
note
i
said
aloud
it
is
forth
is
it
do
you
know
i
looked
down
at
myself
and
shook
my
head
maybe
doctor
forth
i
said
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
also
wearing
a
white
coat
with
the
caduceus
emblem
of
medical
but
it
had
the
wrong
feel
as
if
i
were
dressed
in
somebody
else
clothes
was
no
doctor
was
i
i
pushed
back
one
sleeve
slightly
exposing
a
long
triangular
scar
under
the
cuff
dr
forth
by
now
i
was
sure
was
dr
forth
followed
the
direction
of
my
eyes
where
did
you
get
the
scar
knife
fight
one
of
the
bands
of
caught
us
on
the
slopes
and
we
the
memory
thinned
out
again
and
i
said
despairingly
it
all
confused
what
the
matter
why
am
i
up
on
medical
have
i
had
an
accident
amnesia
not
exactly
i
explain
i
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
unsteadily
because
my
feet
wanted
to
walk
slowly
while
i
felt
like
bursting
through
some
invisible
net
and
striding
there
at
one
bound
once
i
got
to
the
window
the
room
stayed
put
while
i
gulped
down
great
breaths
of
warm
sweetish
air
i
said
i
could
use
a
drink
good
idea
though
i
do
usually
recommend
it
forth
reached
into
a
drawer
for
a
flat
bottle
poured
liquid
into
a
throwaway
cup
after
a
minute
he
poured
more
for
himself
here
and
sit
down
man
you
make
me
nervous
hovering
like
that
i
did
sit
down
i
strode
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
forth
voice
was
low
and
unhurried
what
the
matter
you
can
go
out
if
you
want
to
but
wo
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
for
a
minute
anyway
where
do
you
want
to
go
the
question
made
me
uncomfortable
i
took
a
couple
of
long
breaths
and
came
back
into
the
room
forth
said
drink
this
and
i
poured
it
down
he
refilled
the
cup
unasked
and
i
swallowed
that
too
and
felt
the
hard
lump
in
my
middle
begin
to
loosen
up
and
dissolve
forth
said
claustrophobia
too
typical
and
scribbled
on
the
card
some
more
i
was
getting
tired
of
that
performance
i
turned
on
him
to
tell
him
so
then
suddenly
felt
amused
or
maybe
it
was
the
liquor
working
in
me
he
seemed
such
a
funny
little
man
shutting
himself
up
inside
an
office
like
this
and
talking
about
claustrophobia
and
watching
me
as
if
i
were
a
big
bug
i
tossed
the
cup
into
a
disposal
is
it
about
time
for
a
few
of
those
explanations
if
you
think
you
can
take
it
how
do
you
feel
now
fine
i
sat
down
on
the
couch
again
leaning
back
and
stretching
out
my
long
legs
comfortably
what
did
you
put
in
that
drink
he
chuckled
trade
secret
now
the
easiest
way
to
explain
would
be
to
let
you
watch
a
film
we
made
yesterday
to
watch
i
stopped
it
your
time
we
wasting
he
punched
a
button
on
the
desk
spoke
into
a
mouthpiece
surveillance
give
us
a
monitor
on
he
spoke
a
string
of
incomprehensible
numbers
while
i
lounged
at
ease
on
the
couch
forth
waited
for
an
answer
then
touched
another
button
and
steel
louvers
closed
noiselessly
over
the
windows
blacking
them
out
i
rose
in
sudden
panic
then
relaxed
as
the
room
went
dark
the
darkness
felt
oddly
more
normal
than
the
light
and
i
leaned
back
and
watched
the
flickers
clear
as
one
wall
of
the
office
became
a
large
visionscreen
forth
came
and
sat
beside
me
on
the
leather
couch
but
in
the
picture
forth
was
there
sitting
at
his
desk
watching
another
man
a
stranger
walk
into
the
office
like
forth
the
newcomer
wore
a
white
coat
with
the
caduceus
emblems
i
disliked
the
man
on
sight
he
was
tall
and
lean
and
composed
with
a
dour
face
set
in
thin
lines
i
guessed
that
he
was
somewhere
in
his
thirties
said
sit
down
doctor
and
i
drew
a
long
breath
overwhelmed
by
a
curious
certain
sensation
have
been
here
before
i
have
seen
this
happen
and
curiously
formless
i
felt
i
sat
and
watched
and
i
knew
i
was
watching
and
sitting
but
it
was
in
that
dreamlike
fashion
where
the
dreamer
at
once
watches
his
visions
and
participates
in
them
sit
down
doctor
forth
said
did
you
bring
in
the
reports
jay
allison
carefully
took
the
indicated
seat
poised
nervously
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
he
sat
very
straight
leaning
forward
only
a
little
to
hand
a
thick
folder
of
papers
across
the
desk
forth
took
it
but
did
open
it
what
do
you
think
dr
allison
there
is
no
possible
room
for
doubt
jay
allison
spoke
precisely
in
a
rather
and
emphatic
tone
it
follows
the
statistical
pattern
for
all
recorded
attacks
of
fever
by
the
way
sir
have
we
any
better
name
than
that
for
this
particular
disease
the
term
fever
connotes
a
fever
of
years
duration
rather
than
a
pandemic
recurring
every
years
a
fever
that
lasted
years
would
be
quite
a
fever
dr
forth
said
with
the
shadow
of
a
grim
smile
nevertheless
that
the
only
name
we
have
so
far
name
it
and
you
can
have
it
allison
disease
jay
allison
greeted
this
pleasantry
with
a
repressive
frown
as
i
understand
it
the
disease
cycle
seems
to
be
connected
somehow
with
the
conjunction
of
the
four
moons
which
explains
why
the
darkovans
are
so
superstitious
about
it
the
moons
have
remarkably
eccentric
orbits
i
do
know
anything
about
that
part
i
quoting
moore
if
there
an
animal
vector
to
the
disease
we
never
discovered
it
the
pattern
runs
like
this
a
few
cases
in
the
mountain
districts
the
next
month
a
cases
all
over
this
part
of
the
planet
then
it
skips
exactly
three
months
without
increase
the
next
upswing
puts
the
number
of
reported
cases
in
the
thousands
and
three
months
after
it
reaches
real
pandemic
proportions
and
decimates
the
entire
human
population
of
darkover
that
about
it
forth
admitted
they
bent
together
over
the
folder
jay
allison
drawing
back
slightly
to
avoid
touching
the
other
man
forth
said
we
terrans
have
had
a
trade
compact
on
darkover
for
a
hundred
and
years
the
first
outbreak
of
this
fever
killed
all
but
a
dozen
men
out
of
three
hundred
the
darkovans
were
worse
off
than
we
were
the
last
outbreak
was
quite
so
bad
but
it
was
bad
enough
i
heard
it
has
an
per
cent
mortality
for
humans
that
is
i
understand
the
trailmen
do
die
of
it
the
darkovans
call
it
the
trailmen
fever
dr
forth
because
the
trailmen
are
virtually
immune
to
it
it
remains
in
their
midst
as
a
mild
ailment
taken
by
children
when
it
breaks
out
into
the
virulent
form
every
years
most
of
the
trailmen
are
already
immune
i
took
the
disease
myself
as
a
child
maybe
you
heard
forth
nodded
you
may
be
the
only
terran
ever
to
contract
the
disease
and
survive
the
trailmen
incubate
the
disease
jay
allison
said
i
should
think
the
logical
thing
would
be
to
drop
a
couple
of
hydrogen
bombs
on
the
trail
cities
and
wipe
it
out
for
good
and
all
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
forth
dark
office
i
stiffened
with
such
fury
that
he
shook
my
shoulder
and
muttered
easy
there
man
dr
forth
on
the
screen
looked
annoyed
and
jay
allison
said
with
a
grimace
of
distaste
i
did
mean
that
literally
but
the
trailmen
are
not
human
it
would
be
genocide
just
an
exterminator
job
a
public
health
measure
forth
looked
shocked
as
he
realized
that
the
younger
man
meant
what
he
was
saying
he
said
galactic
center
would
have
to
rule
on
whether
they
dumb
animals
or
intelligent
and
whether
entitled
to
the
status
of
a
civilization
all
precedent
on
darkover
is
toward
recognizing
them
as
men
and
good
god
jay
you
probably
be
called
as
a
witness
for
the
defense
how
can
you
say
they
not
human
after
your
experience
with
them
anyway
by
the
time
their
status
was
finally
decided
half
of
the
recognizable
humans
on
darkover
would
be
dead
we
need
a
better
solution
than
that
he
pushed
his
chair
back
and
looked
out
the
window
i
wo
go
into
the
political
situation
he
said
you
interested
in
terran
empire
politics
and
i
no
expert
either
but
you
have
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
not
to
know
that
darkover
been
playing
the
immovable
object
to
the
irresistible
force
the
darkovans
are
more
advanced
in
some
of
the
sciences
than
we
are
and
until
now
they
would
admit
that
terra
had
a
thing
to
contribute
however
and
this
is
the
big
however
they
do
know
and
they
willing
to
admit
that
our
medical
sciences
are
better
than
theirs
theirs
being
practically
exactly
and
this
could
be
the
first
crack
in
the
barrier
you
may
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
but
the
legate
received
an
offer
from
the
hasturs
themselves
jay
allison
murmured
i
to
be
impressed
on
darkover
you
damn
well
better
be
impressed
when
the
hasturs
sit
up
and
take
notice
i
understand
they
telepaths
or
something
telepaths
psychokinetics
parapsychs
just
about
anything
else
for
all
practical
purposes
they
the
gods
of
darkover
and
one
of
the
hasturs
a
rather
young
and
unimportant
one
i
admit
the
old
grandson
came
to
the
legate
office
in
person
mind
you
he
offered
if
the
terran
medical
would
help
darkover
lick
the
trailmen
fever
to
coach
selected
terran
men
in
matrix
mechanics
good
lord
jay
said
it
was
a
concession
beyond
terra
wildest
dreams
for
a
hundred
years
they
had
tried
to
beg
buy
or
steal
some
knowledge
of
the
mysterious
science
of
matrix
mechanics
that
curious
discipline
which
could
turn
matter
into
raw
energy
and
vice
versa
without
any
intermediate
stages
and
without
fission
matrix
mechanics
had
made
the
darkovans
virtually
immune
to
the
lure
of
advanced
technologies
jay
said
personally
i
think
darkovan
science
is
but
i
can
see
the
propaganda
angle
not
to
mention
the
humanitarian
angle
of
healing
jay
allison
gave
one
of
his
cold
shrugs
the
real
angle
seems
to
be
this
we
cure
the
fever
not
yet
but
we
have
a
lead
during
the
last
epidemic
a
terran
scientist
discovered
a
blood
fraction
containing
antibodies
against
the
fever
in
the
trailmen
isolated
to
a
serum
it
might
reduce
the
virulent
epidemic
form
to
the
mild
form
again
unfortunately
he
died
himself
in
the
epidemic
without
finishing
his
work
and
his
notebooks
were
overlooked
until
this
year
we
have
men
and
their
families
on
darkover
now
jay
frankly
if
we
lose
too
many
of
them
we
going
to
have
to
pull
out
of
darkover
the
big
brass
on
terra
will
write
off
the
loss
of
a
garrison
of
professional
traders
but
not
of
a
whole
trade
city
colony
that
not
even
mentioning
the
prestige
lose
if
our
terran
medical
sciences
ca
save
darkover
from
an
epidemic
we
got
exactly
five
months
we
ca
synthesize
a
serum
in
that
time
we
got
to
appeal
to
the
trailmen
and
that
why
i
called
you
up
here
you
know
more
about
the
trailmen
than
any
living
terran
you
ought
to
you
spent
eight
years
in
a
nest
in
forth
darkened
office
i
sat
up
straighter
with
a
flash
of
returning
memory
jay
allison
i
judged
was
several
years
older
than
i
but
we
had
one
thing
in
common
this
cold
fish
of
a
man
shared
with
myself
that
experience
of
marvelous
years
spent
in
an
alien
world
jay
allison
scowled
displeased
that
was
years
ago
i
was
hardly
more
than
a
baby
my
father
crashed
on
a
mapping
expedition
over
the
hellers
god
only
knows
what
possessed
him
to
try
and
take
a
light
plane
over
those
crosswinds
i
survived
the
crash
by
the
merest
chance
and
lived
with
the
trailmen
so
i
told
until
i
was
thirteen
or
fourteen
i
do
remember
much
about
it
children
are
particularly
observant
forth
leaned
over
the
desk
staring
you
speak
their
language
you
i
used
to
i
might
remember
it
under
hypnosis
i
suppose
why
do
you
want
me
to
translate
something
not
exactly
we
were
thinking
of
sending
you
on
an
expedition
to
the
trailmen
themselves
in
the
darkened
office
watching
jay
startled
face
i
thought
god
what
an
adventure
i
wonder
i
wonder
if
they
want
me
to
go
with
him
forth
was
explaining
it
would
be
a
difficult
trek
you
know
what
the
hellers
are
like
still
you
used
to
climb
mountains
as
a
hobby
before
you
went
into
medical
i
outgrew
the
childishness
of
hobbies
many
years
ago
sir
jay
said
stiffly
we
get
you
the
best
guides
we
could
terran
and
darkovan
but
they
could
do
the
one
thing
you
can
do
you
the
trailmen
jay
you
might
be
able
to
persuade
them
to
do
the
one
thing
they
never
done
before
what
that
jay
allison
sounded
suspicious
come
out
of
the
mountains
send
us
volunteers
blood
donors
we
might
if
we
had
enough
blood
to
work
on
be
able
to
isolate
the
right
fraction
and
synthesize
it
in
time
to
prevent
the
epidemic
from
really
taking
hold
jay
it
a
tough
mission
and
it
dangerous
as
all
hell
but
somebody
got
to
do
it
and
i
afraid
you
the
only
qualified
man
i
like
my
first
suggestion
better
bomb
the
trailmen
and
the
hellers
right
off
the
planet
jay
face
was
set
in
lines
of
loathing
which
he
controlled
after
a
minute
and
said
i
i
did
mean
that
theoretically
i
can
see
the
necessity
only
he
stopped
and
swallowed
please
say
what
you
were
going
to
say
i
wonder
if
i
am
as
well
qualified
as
you
think
no
do
interrupt
i
find
the
natives
of
darkover
distasteful
even
the
humans
as
for
the
trailmen
i
was
getting
mad
and
impatient
i
whispered
to
forth
in
the
darkness
shut
the
damn
film
off
you
could
send
guy
on
an
errand
like
i
rather
forth
snapped
shut
up
and
listen
i
shut
up
and
the
film
continued
to
repeat
jay
allison
was
not
acting
he
was
pained
and
disgusted
forth
let
him
finish
his
explanation
of
why
he
had
refused
even
to
teach
in
the
medical
college
established
for
darkovans
by
the
terran
empire
he
interrupted
and
he
sounded
irritated
we
know
all
that
it
evidently
never
occurred
to
you
jay
that
it
an
inconvenience
to
us
that
all
this
vital
knowledge
should
lie
purely
by
accident
in
the
hands
of
the
one
man
who
too
damned
stubborn
to
use
it
jay
did
move
an
eyelash
where
i
would
have
squirmed
i
have
always
been
aware
of
that
doctor
forth
drew
a
long
breath
i
concede
you
not
suitable
at
the
moment
jay
but
what
do
you
know
of
applied
psychodynamics
very
little
i
sorry
to
say
allison
did
sound
sorry
though
he
sounded
bored
to
death
with
the
whole
conversation
may
i
be
blunt
and
personal
please
do
i
not
at
all
sensitive
basically
then
doctor
allison
a
person
as
contained
and
repressed
as
yourself
usually
has
a
clearly
defined
subsidiary
personality
in
neurotic
individuals
this
complex
of
personality
traits
sometimes
splits
off
and
we
get
a
syndrome
known
as
multiple
or
alternate
personality
i
scanned
a
few
of
the
classic
cases
was
there
a
woman
with
four
separate
personalities
exactly
however
you
are
neurotic
and
ordinarily
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
chance
of
your
repressed
alternate
taking
over
your
personality
thank
you
jay
murmured
ironically
i
be
losing
sleep
over
that
nevertheless
i
presume
you
have
such
a
subsidiary
personality
although
he
would
normally
never
manifest
this
subsidiary
let
call
him
would
embody
all
the
characteristics
which
you
repress
he
would
be
gregarious
where
you
are
retiring
and
studious
adventurous
where
you
are
cautious
talkative
while
you
are
taciturn
he
would
perhaps
enjoy
action
for
its
own
sake
while
you
exercise
faithfully
in
the
gymnasium
only
for
your
health
sake
and
he
might
even
remember
the
trailmen
with
pleasure
rather
than
dislike
in
short
a
blend
of
all
the
undesirable
characteristics
one
could
put
it
that
way
certainly
he
would
be
a
blend
of
all
the
characteristics
which
you
undesirable
but
if
released
by
hypnotism
and
suggestion
he
might
be
suitable
for
the
job
in
hand
but
how
do
you
know
i
actually
have
such
an
alternate
i
do
but
it
a
good
guess
most
repressed
forth
coughed
and
amended
most
personalities
possess
such
a
suppressed
secondary
personality
do
you
occasionally
rather
rarely
find
yourself
doing
things
which
are
entirely
out
of
character
for
you
i
could
almost
feel
allison
taking
it
in
as
he
confessed
well
yes
for
instance
the
other
day
although
i
dress
conservatively
at
all
times
he
glanced
at
his
uniform
coat
i
found
myself
buying
he
stopped
again
and
his
face
went
an
unlovely
color
as
he
finally
mumbled
a
flowered
red
sports
shirt
sitting
in
the
dark
i
felt
vaguely
sorry
for
the
poor
gawk
disturbed
by
ashamed
of
the
only
human
impulses
he
ever
had
on
the
screen
allison
frowned
fiercely
a
crazy
impulse
you
could
say
that
or
say
it
was
an
action
of
the
suppressed
how
about
it
allison
you
may
be
the
only
terran
on
darkover
maybe
the
only
human
who
could
get
into
a
trailman
nest
without
being
murdered
sir
as
a
citizen
of
the
empire
i
do
have
any
choice
do
i
jay
look
forth
said
and
i
felt
him
trying
to
reach
through
the
barricade
and
touch
really
touch
that
cold
contained
young
man
we
could
any
man
to
do
anything
like
this
aside
from
the
ordinary
dangers
it
could
destroy
your
personal
balance
maybe
permanently
i
asking
you
to
volunteer
something
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
man
to
man
what
do
you
say
i
would
have
been
moved
by
his
words
even
at
secondhand
i
was
moved
by
them
jay
allison
looked
at
the
floor
and
i
saw
him
twist
his
long
surgeon
hands
and
crack
the
knuckles
with
an
odd
gesture
finally
he
said
i
have
any
choice
either
way
doctor
i
take
the
chance
i
go
to
the
trailmen
the
screen
went
dark
again
and
forth
flicked
the
light
on
he
said
well
i
gave
it
back
in
his
own
intonation
well
and
was
exasperated
to
find
that
i
was
twisting
my
own
knuckles
in
the
nervous
gesture
of
allison
painful
decision
i
jerked
them
apart
and
got
up
i
suppose
it
did
work
with
that
cold
fish
and
you
decided
to
come
to
me
instead
sure
go
to
the
trailmen
for
you
not
with
that
allison
i
would
go
anywhere
with
that
guy
but
i
speak
the
trailmen
language
and
without
hypnosis
either
forth
was
staring
at
me
so
you
remembered
that
hell
yes
i
said
my
dad
crashed
in
the
hellers
and
a
band
of
trailmen
found
me
half
dead
i
lived
there
until
i
was
about
fifteen
then
their
decided
i
was
too
human
for
them
and
they
took
me
out
through
dammerung
pass
and
arranged
to
have
me
brought
here
sure
it
all
coming
back
now
i
spent
five
years
in
the
orphanage
then
i
went
to
work
taking
terran
tourists
on
hunting
parties
and
so
on
because
i
liked
being
around
the
mountains
i
i
stopped
forth
was
staring
at
me
you
think
you
like
this
job
it
would
be
tough
i
said
considering
the
people
of
the
sky
using
the
trailmen
name
for
themselves
do
like
outsiders
but
they
might
be
persuaded
the
worst
part
would
be
getting
there
the
plane
or
the
is
built
that
can
get
through
the
crosswinds
around
the
hellers
and
land
inside
them
we
have
to
go
on
foot
all
the
way
from
carthon
i
need
professional
climbers
mountaineers
then
you
do
share
allison
attitude
dammit
do
insult
me
i
discovered
that
i
was
on
my
feet
again
pacing
the
office
restlessly
forth
stared
and
mused
aloud
personality
anyway
a
mask
of
emotions
superimposed
on
the
body
and
the
intellect
change
the
point
of
view
change
the
emotions
and
desires
and
even
with
the
same
body
and
the
same
past
experiences
you
have
a
new
man
i
swung
round
in
a
new
and
terrible
suspicion
too
monstrous
to
name
was
creeping
up
on
me
forth
touched
a
button
and
the
face
of
jay
allison
immobile
appeared
on
the
visionscreen
forth
put
a
mirror
in
my
hand
he
said
jason
allison
look
at
yourself
i
looked
no
i
said
and
again
no
no
no
forth
did
argue
he
pointed
with
a
stubby
finger
look
he
moved
the
finger
as
he
spoke
height
of
forehead
set
of
cheekbones
your
eyebrows
look
different
and
your
mouth
because
the
expression
is
different
but
bony
structure
the
nose
the
chin
i
heard
myself
make
a
queer
sound
dashed
the
mirror
to
the
floor
he
grabbed
my
forearm
steady
man
i
found
a
scrap
of
my
voice
it
did
sound
like
allison
then
i
jay
allison
with
amnesia
not
exactly
forth
mopped
his
forehead
with
an
immaculate
sleeve
and
it
came
away
damp
with
sweat
no
jay
allison
as
i
know
him
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
sit
down
whoever
you
are
sit
i
sat
gingerly
not
sure
but
the
man
jay
might
have
been
given
a
different
temperamental
bias
i
say
the
man
jay
allison
started
out
to
be
the
man
he
to
be
within
his
subconscious
he
built
up
barriers
against
a
whole
series
of
memories
and
the
subliminal
threshold
doc
i
do
understand
the
psycho
talk
forth
stared
and
you
do
remember
the
trailmen
language
i
thought
so
allison
personality
is
suppressed
in
you
as
yours
was
in
him
one
thing
doc
i
do
know
a
thing
about
blood
fractions
or
epidemics
my
half
of
the
personality
did
study
medicine
i
took
up
the
mirror
again
and
broodingly
studied
the
face
there
the
high
thin
cheeks
high
forehead
shaded
by
coarse
dark
hair
which
jay
allison
had
slicked
down
now
heavily
rumpled
i
still
did
think
i
looked
anything
like
the
doctor
our
voices
were
nothing
alike
either
his
had
been
pitched
rather
high
falsetto
my
own
as
nearly
as
i
could
judge
was
a
full
octave
deeper
and
more
resonant
yet
they
issued
from
the
same
vocal
chords
unless
forth
was
having
a
reasonless
macabre
joke
did
i
study
medicine
it
the
last
thing
i
think
about
it
an
honest
trade
i
guess
but
i
never
been
that
intellectual
you
or
rather
jay
allison
is
a
specialist
in
darkovan
parasitology
as
well
as
a
very
competent
surgeon
forth
was
sitting
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
watching
me
intently
he
scowled
and
said
if
anything
the
physical
change
is
more
startling
than
the
other
i
would
have
recognized
you
that
tallies
with
me
i
do
recognize
myself
i
added
and
the
queer
thing
is
i
did
even
jay
allison
to
put
it
mildly
if
he
i
ca
say
can
i
i
do
know
why
not
you
no
more
jay
allison
than
i
am
for
one
thing
you
younger
ten
years
younger
i
doubt
if
any
of
his
friends
if
he
had
any
would
recognize
you
you
it
ridiculous
to
go
on
calling
you
what
should
i
call
you
why
should
i
care
call
me
jason
suits
you
forth
said
enigmatically
look
then
jason
i
like
to
give
you
a
few
days
to
readjust
to
your
new
personality
but
we
are
really
pressed
for
time
can
you
fly
to
carthon
tonight
a
good
crew
for
you
and
sent
them
on
ahead
you
meet
them
there
you
find
them
competent
i
stared
at
him
suddenly
the
room
oppressed
me
and
i
found
it
hard
to
breathe
i
said
in
wonder
you
were
pretty
sure
of
yourself
you
forth
just
looked
at
me
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
then
he
said
in
a
very
quiet
voice
no
i
was
sure
at
all
but
if
you
did
turn
up
and
i
could
talk
jay
into
it
i
have
had
to
try
it
myself
jason
allison
junior
was
listed
on
the
directory
of
the
terran
hq
as
suite
medical
residence
corridor
i
found
the
rooms
without
any
trouble
though
an
elderly
doctor
stared
at
me
rather
curiously
as
i
barged
along
the
quiet
hallway
the
suite
bedroom
minuscule
compact
bath
depressed
me
clean
and
neutral
as
the
man
who
owned
them
i
rummaged
them
restlessly
trying
to
find
some
scrap
of
familiarity
to
indicate
that
i
had
lived
here
for
the
past
eleven
years
jay
allison
was
years
old
i
had
given
my
age
without
hesitation
as
there
were
no
obvious
blanks
in
my
memory
from
the
moment
jay
allison
had
spoken
of
the
trailmen
my
past
had
rushed
back
and
stood
complete
to
yesterday
supper
only
had
i
eaten
that
supper
twelve
years
ago
i
remembered
my
father
a
lined
silent
man
who
had
liked
to
fly
solitary
taking
photograph
after
photograph
from
his
plane
for
the
meticulous
work
of
mapping
and
exploration
he
liked
to
have
me
fly
with
him
and
i
flown
over
virtually
every
inch
of
the
planet
no
one
else
had
ever
dared
fly
over
the
hellers
except
the
big
commercial
spacecraft
that
kept
to
a
safe
altitude
i
vaguely
remembered
the
crash
and
the
strange
hands
pulling
me
out
of
the
wreckage
and
the
weeks
i
spent
and
delirious
gently
tended
by
one
of
the
twittering
women
of
the
trailmen
in
all
i
had
spent
eight
years
in
the
nest
which
was
not
a
nest
at
all
but
a
vast
sprawling
city
built
in
the
branches
of
enormous
trees
with
the
small
and
delicate
humanoids
who
had
been
my
playfellows
i
had
gathered
the
nuts
and
buds
and
trapped
the
small
arboreal
animals
they
used
for
food
taken
my
share
at
weaving
clothing
from
the
fibres
of
parasite
plants
cultivated
on
the
stems
and
in
all
those
eight
years
i
had
set
foot
on
the
ground
less
than
a
dozen
times
even
though
i
had
travelled
for
miles
through
the
high
above
the
forest
floor
then
the
painful
decision
that
i
was
too
alien
for
them
and
the
difficult
and
dangerous
journey
my
trailmen
and
had
undertaken
to
help
me
out
of
the
hellers
and
arrange
for
me
to
be
taken
to
the
trade
city
after
two
years
of
physically
painful
and
mentally
rebellious
readjustment
to
daytime
living
the
trailmen
saw
best
and
lived
largely
by
moonlight
i
had
found
a
niche
for
myself
and
settled
down
but
all
of
the
later
years
after
jay
allison
had
taken
over
i
supposed
from
a
basic
pattern
of
memory
common
to
both
of
us
had
vanished
into
the
limbo
of
the
subconscious
a
bookrack
was
crammed
with
large
microcards
i
slipped
one
into
the
viewer
with
a
queer
sense
of
spying
and
found
myself
listening
apprehensively
to
hear
that
measured
step
and
jay
allison
falsetto
voice
demanding
what
the
hell
i
was
doing
meddling
with
his
possessions
eye
to
the
viewer
i
read
briefly
at
random
something
about
the
management
of
compound
fracture
then
realized
i
had
understood
exactly
three
words
in
a
paragraph
i
put
my
fist
against
my
forehead
and
heard
the
words
echoing
there
emptily
laceration
primary
efflusion
serum
and
lymph
granulation
tissue
i
presumed
that
the
words
meant
something
and
that
i
once
had
known
what
but
if
i
had
a
medical
education
i
did
recall
a
syllable
of
it
i
did
know
a
fracture
from
a
fraction
in
a
sudden
frenzy
of
impatience
i
stripped
off
the
white
coat
and
put
on
the
first
shirt
i
came
to
a
crimson
thing
that
hung
in
the
line
of
white
coats
like
an
exotic
bird
in
snow
country
i
went
back
to
rummaging
the
drawers
and
bureaus
carelessly
shoved
in
a
pigeonhole
i
found
another
microcard
that
looked
familiar
and
when
i
slipped
it
mechanically
into
the
viewer
it
turned
out
to
be
a
book
on
mountaineering
which
oddly
enough
i
remembered
buying
as
a
youngster
it
dispelled
my
last
lingering
doubts
evidently
i
had
bought
it
before
the
personalities
had
forked
so
sharply
apart
and
separated
jason
from
jay
i
was
beginning
to
believe
not
to
accept
just
to
believe
it
had
happened
the
book
looked
and
had
been
handled
so
much
i
had
to
baby
it
into
the
slot
of
the
viewer
under
a
folded
pile
of
clean
underwear
i
found
a
flat
bottle
of
whiskey
i
remembered
forth
words
that
he
never
seen
jay
allison
drink
and
suddenly
i
thought
the
fool
i
fixed
myself
a
drink
and
sat
down
idly
scanning
over
the
mountaineering
book
not
till
i
entered
medical
school
i
suspected
did
the
two
halves
of
me
fork
so
strongly
apart
so
strongly
that
there
had
been
days
and
weeks
and
i
suspected
years
where
jay
allison
had
kept
me
prisoner
i
tried
to
juggle
dates
in
my
mind
looked
at
a
calendar
and
got
such
a
mental
jolt
that
i
put
it
to
think
about
when
i
was
a
little
drunker
i
wondered
if
my
detailed
memories
of
my
teens
and
early
twenties
were
the
same
memories
jay
allison
looked
back
on
i
did
think
so
people
forget
and
remember
selectively
week
by
week
then
and
year
by
year
the
dominant
personality
of
jay
had
crowded
me
out
so
that
the
young
rowdy
more
than
half
darkovan
loving
the
mountains
for
a
world
had
been
drowned
in
the
chilly
austere
young
medical
student
who
lost
himself
in
his
work
but
i
jason
i
had
always
been
the
watcher
behind
the
person
jay
allison
dared
not
be
why
was
he
past
thirty
and
i
just
a
ringing
shattered
the
silence
i
had
to
hunt
for
the
intercom
on
the
bedroom
wall
i
said
who
is
it
and
an
unfamiliar
voice
demanded
dr
allison
i
said
automatically
nobody
here
by
that
name
and
started
to
put
back
the
mouthpiece
then
i
stopped
and
gulped
and
asked
is
that
you
dr
forth
it
was
and
i
breathed
again
i
did
even
want
to
think
about
what
say
if
somebody
else
had
demanded
to
know
why
in
the
devil
i
was
answering
allison
private
telephone
when
forth
had
finished
i
went
to
the
mirror
and
stared
trying
to
see
behind
my
face
the
sharp
features
of
that
stranger
jason
allison
i
delayed
even
while
i
was
wondering
what
few
things
i
should
pack
for
a
trip
into
the
mountains
and
the
habit
of
hunting
parties
was
making
mental
lists
about
and
windbreakers
the
face
that
looked
at
me
was
a
young
face
unlined
and
faintly
freckled
the
same
face
as
always
except
that
i
lost
my
suntan
jay
allison
had
kept
me
indoors
too
long
suddenly
i
struck
the
mirror
lightly
with
my
fist
the
hell
with
you
allison
i
said
and
went
to
see
if
he
had
kept
any
clothes
fit
to
pack
dr
forth
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
small
skyport
on
the
roof
and
so
was
a
small
one
of
the
fairly
old
ones
assigned
to
medical
service
when
they
were
too
for
services
with
higher
priority
forth
took
one
startled
stare
at
my
crimson
shirt
but
all
he
said
was
hello
jason
here
something
we
got
to
decide
right
away
do
we
tell
the
crew
who
you
really
are
i
shook
my
head
emphatically
i
not
jay
allison
i
do
want
his
name
or
his
reputation
unless
there
are
men
on
the
crew
who
know
allison
by
sight
some
of
them
do
but
i
do
think
they
recognize
you
tell
them
i
his
twin
brother
i
said
humorlessly
that
would
be
necessary
there
not
enough
resemblance
forth
raised
his
head
and
beckoned
to
a
man
who
was
doing
something
near
the
he
said
under
his
breath
you
see
what
i
mean
as
the
man
approached
he
wore
the
uniform
of
spaceforce
black
leather
with
a
little
rainbow
of
stars
on
his
sleeve
meaning
he
seen
service
on
a
dozen
different
planets
a
different
colored
star
for
each
one
he
was
a
young
man
but
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
seamed
and
burly
and
huge
with
a
split
lip
and
weathered
face
i
liked
his
looks
we
shook
hands
and
forth
said
this
is
our
man
kendricks
he
called
jason
and
he
an
expert
on
the
trailmen
jason
this
is
buck
kendricks
glad
to
know
you
jason
i
thought
kendricks
looked
at
me
half
a
second
more
than
necessary
the
ready
climb
in
doc
going
as
far
as
carthon
are
you
we
put
on
zippered
windbreaks
and
the
soared
noiselessly
into
the
pale
crimson
sky
i
sat
beside
forth
looking
down
through
pale
lilac
clouds
at
the
pattern
of
darkover
spread
below
me
kendricks
was
giving
me
a
funny
eye
doc
what
biting
him
he
has
known
jay
allison
for
eight
years
forth
said
quietly
and
he
has
recognized
you
yet
but
we
let
it
ride
at
that
to
my
great
relief
and
did
talk
any
more
about
me
at
all
as
we
flew
under
silent
whirring
blades
turning
our
backs
on
the
settled
country
which
lay
near
the
trade
city
we
talked
about
darkover
itself
forth
told
me
about
the
trailmen
fever
and
managed
to
give
me
some
idea
about
what
the
blood
fraction
was
and
why
it
was
necessary
to
persuade
fifty
or
sixty
of
the
humanoids
to
return
with
me
to
donate
blood
from
which
the
antibody
could
be
first
isolated
then
synthesised
it
would
be
a
totally
thing
if
i
could
accomplish
it
most
of
the
trailmen
never
touched
ground
in
their
entire
lives
except
when
crossing
the
passes
above
the
snow
line
not
a
dozen
of
them
including
my
who
had
so
painfully
brought
me
out
across
dammerung
had
ever
crossed
the
ring
of
encircling
mountains
that
walled
them
away
from
the
rest
of
the
planet
humans
sometimes
penetrated
the
lower
forests
in
search
of
the
trailmen
it
was
traffic
the
trailmen
never
came
in
search
of
we
talked
too
about
some
of
those
humans
who
had
crossed
the
mountains
into
trailmen
country
those
mountains
profanely
dubbed
the
hellers
by
the
first
terrans
who
had
tried
to
fly
over
them
in
anything
lower
or
slower
than
a
spaceship
the
darkovan
name
for
the
hellers
was
even
more
explicit
and
even
in
translation
unrepeatable
what
about
this
crew
you
picked
they
not
terrans
forth
shook
his
head
it
would
be
murder
to
send
anyone
recognizably
terran
into
the
hellers
you
know
how
the
trailmen
feel
about
outsiders
getting
into
their
country
i
knew
forth
continued
just
the
same
there
will
be
two
terrans
with
you
they
do
know
jay
allison
i
did
want
to
be
burdened
with
anyone
not
anyone
who
would
know
me
or
expect
me
to
behave
like
my
forgotten
other
self
kendricks
knows
you
forth
said
but
i
going
to
be
perfectly
truthful
i
never
knew
jay
allison
well
except
in
line
of
work
i
know
a
lot
of
things
from
the
past
couple
of
days
which
came
out
during
the
hypnotic
sessions
which
he
never
have
dreamed
of
telling
me
or
anyone
else
consciously
and
that
comes
under
the
heading
of
a
professional
confidence
even
from
you
and
for
that
reason
i
sending
kendricks
along
and
you
going
to
have
to
take
the
chance
recognize
you
is
that
carthon
down
there
carthon
lay
nestled
under
the
outlying
foothills
of
the
hellers
ancient
and
sprawling
and
squatty
and
burned
brown
with
the
dust
of
five
thousand
years
children
ran
out
to
stare
at
the
as
we
landed
near
the
city
few
planes
ever
flew
low
enough
to
be
seen
this
near
the
hellers
forth
had
sent
his
crew
ahead
and
parked
them
in
an
abandoned
huge
place
at
the
edge
of
the
city
which
might
once
have
been
a
warehouse
or
a
ruined
palace
inside
there
were
a
couple
of
trucks
stripped
down
to
framework
and
flatbed
like
all
machinery
shipped
through
space
from
terra
there
were
pack
animals
dark
shapes
in
the
gloom
crates
were
stacked
up
in
an
orderly
untidiness
and
at
the
far
end
a
fire
was
burning
and
five
or
six
men
in
darkovan
clothing
loose
sleeved
shirts
tight
wrapped
breeches
low
boots
were
squatting
around
it
talking
they
got
up
as
forth
and
kendricks
and
i
walked
toward
them
and
forth
greeted
them
clumsily
in
bad
accented
darkovan
then
switched
to
terran
standard
letting
one
of
the
men
translate
for
him
forth
introduced
me
simply
as
jason
after
the
darkovan
custom
and
i
looked
the
men
over
one
by
one
back
when
i
climbed
for
fun
liked
to
pick
my
own
men
but
whoever
had
picked
this
crew
must
have
known
his
business
three
were
mountain
darkovans
lean
swart
men
enough
alike
to
be
brothers
i
learned
after
a
while
that
they
actually
were
brothers
hjalmar
garin
and
vardo
all
three
were
well
over
six
feet
and
hjalmar
stood
head
and
shoulders
over
his
brothers
whom
i
never
learned
to
tell
apart
the
fourth
man
a
redhead
was
dressed
rather
better
than
the
others
and
introduced
as
lerrys
ridenow
the
double
name
indicating
high
darkovan
aristocracy
he
looked
muscular
and
agile
enough
but
his
hands
were
suspiciously
for
a
mountain
man
and
i
wondered
how
much
experience
he
had
the
fifth
man
shook
hands
with
me
speaking
to
kendricks
and
forth
as
if
they
were
old
friends
do
i
know
you
from
someplace
jason
he
looked
darkovan
and
wore
darkovan
clothes
but
forth
had
forewarned
me
and
attack
seemed
the
best
defense
are
you
terran
my
father
was
he
said
and
i
understood
a
situation
not
exactly
uncommon
but
ticklish
on
a
planet
like
darkover
i
said
carelessly
i
may
have
seen
you
around
the
hq
i
ca
place
you
though
my
name
rafe
scott
i
thought
i
knew
most
of
the
professional
guides
on
darkover
but
i
admit
i
do
get
into
the
hellers
much
he
confessed
which
route
are
we
going
to
take
i
found
myself
drawn
into
the
middle
of
the
group
of
men
accepting
one
of
the
small
sweetish
darkovan
cigarettes
looking
over
the
plan
somebody
had
scribbled
down
on
the
top
of
a
packing
case
i
borrowed
a
pencil
from
rafe
and
bent
over
the
case
sketching
out
a
rough
map
of
the
terrain
i
remembered
so
well
from
boyhood
i
might
be
bewildered
about
blood
fractions
but
when
it
came
to
climbing
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
rafe
and
lerrys
and
the
darkovan
brothers
crowded
behind
me
to
look
over
the
sketch
and
lerrys
put
a
long
fingernail
on
the
route
indicated
your
elevation
pretty
bad
here
he
said
diffidently
and
on
the
campaign
the
trailmen
attacked
us
here
and
it
was
bad
fighting
along
those
ledges
i
looked
at
him
with
new
respect
dainty
hands
or
not
he
evidently
knew
the
country
kendricks
patted
the
blaster
on
his
hip
and
said
grimly
but
this
is
the
campaign
i
like
to
see
any
trailmen
attack
us
while
i
have
this
but
you
not
going
to
have
it
said
a
voice
behind
us
a
crisp
authoritative
voice
take
off
that
gun
man
kendricks
and
i
whirled
together
to
see
the
speaker
a
tall
young
darkovan
still
standing
in
the
shadows
the
newcomer
spoke
to
me
directly
i
told
you
are
terran
but
that
you
understand
the
trailmen
surely
you
do
intend
to
carry
fission
or
fusion
weapons
against
them
and
i
suddenly
realized
that
we
were
in
darkovan
territory
now
and
that
we
must
reckon
with
the
darkovan
horror
of
guns
or
of
any
weapon
which
reaches
beyond
the
of
the
man
who
wields
it
a
simple
to
the
darkovan
ethical
code
is
as
reprehensible
as
a
planetbuster
kendricks
protested
we
ca
travel
unarmed
through
trailmen
country
we
apt
to
meet
hostile
bands
of
the
creatures
and
they
nasty
with
those
long
knives
they
carry
the
stranger
said
calmly
i
no
objection
to
you
or
anyone
else
carrying
a
knife
for
a
kendricks
drew
breath
to
roar
listen
you
who
do
you
think
you
are
anyway
the
darkovans
muttered
the
man
in
the
shadows
said
regis
hastur
kendricks
stared
my
own
eyes
could
have
popped
but
i
decided
it
was
time
for
me
to
take
charge
if
i
were
ever
going
to
i
rapped
all
right
this
is
my
show
buck
give
me
the
gun
he
looked
wrathfully
at
me
for
a
space
of
seconds
while
i
wondered
what
i
do
if
he
did
then
slowly
he
unbuckled
the
straps
and
handed
it
to
me
butt
first
i
never
realized
quite
how
undressed
a
spaceforce
man
looked
without
his
blaster
i
balanced
it
on
my
palm
for
a
minute
while
regis
hastur
came
out
of
the
shadows
he
was
tall
and
had
the
reddish
hair
and
fair
skin
of
darkovan
aristocracy
and
on
his
face
was
some
indefinable
stamp
arrogance
perhaps
or
the
consciousness
that
the
hasturs
had
ruled
this
world
for
centuries
long
before
the
terrans
brought
ships
and
trade
and
the
universe
to
their
doors
he
was
looking
at
me
as
if
he
approved
of
me
and
that
was
one
step
worse
than
the
former
situation
so
using
the
respectful
darkovan
idiom
of
speaking
to
a
superior
which
he
was
but
keeping
my
voice
hard
i
said
there
just
one
leader
on
any
trek
lord
hastur
on
this
one
i
it
if
you
want
to
discuss
whether
or
not
we
carry
guns
i
suggest
you
discuss
it
with
me
in
private
and
let
me
give
the
orders
one
of
the
darkovans
gasped
i
knew
i
could
have
been
mobbed
but
with
a
mixed
bag
of
men
i
had
to
grab
leadership
quick
or
be
relegated
to
nowhere
i
did
give
regis
hastur
a
chance
to
answer
that
either
i
said
come
back
here
i
want
to
talk
to
you
anyway
he
came
and
i
remembered
to
breathe
i
led
the
way
to
a
fairly
deserted
corner
of
the
immense
place
faced
him
and
demanded
as
for
you
what
are
you
doing
here
you
not
intending
to
cross
the
mountains
with
us
he
met
my
scowl
levelly
i
certainly
am
i
groaned
why
you
the
regent
grandson
important
people
take
on
this
kind
of
dangerous
work
if
anything
happens
to
you
it
will
be
my
responsibility
i
was
going
to
have
enough
trouble
i
was
thinking
without
shepherding
along
one
of
the
most
revered
personages
on
the
whole
damned
planet
i
did
want
anyone
around
who
had
to
be
fawned
on
or
deferred
to
or
even
listened
to
he
frowned
slightly
and
i
had
the
unpleasant
impression
that
he
knew
what
i
was
thinking
in
the
first
place
it
will
mean
something
to
the
trailmen
wo
it
to
have
a
hastur
with
you
suing
for
this
favor
it
certainly
would
the
trailmen
paid
little
enough
heed
to
the
ordinary
humans
except
for
considering
them
fair
game
for
plundering
when
they
came
uninvited
into
trailman
country
but
they
with
all
darkover
revered
the
hasturs
and
it
was
a
fine
point
of
diplomacy
if
the
darkovans
sent
their
most
important
leader
they
might
listen
to
him
in
the
second
place
regis
hastur
continued
the
darkovans
are
my
people
and
it
my
business
to
negotiate
for
them
in
the
third
place
i
know
the
trailmen
dialect
not
well
but
i
can
speak
it
a
little
and
in
the
fourth
i
climbed
mountains
all
my
life
purely
as
an
amateur
but
i
can
assure
you
i
wo
be
in
the
way
there
was
little
enough
i
could
say
to
that
he
seemed
to
have
covered
every
point
or
every
point
but
one
and
he
added
shrewdly
after
a
minute
do
worry
i
perfectly
willing
to
have
you
take
charge
i
wo
claim
privilege
i
had
to
be
satisfied
with
that
darkover
is
a
civilized
planet
with
a
fairly
high
standard
of
living
but
it
is
not
a
mechanized
or
a
technological
culture
the
people
do
much
mining
or
build
factories
and
the
few
which
were
founded
by
terran
enterprise
never
were
very
successful
outside
the
terran
trade
city
machinery
or
modern
transportation
is
almost
unknown
while
the
other
men
checked
and
loaded
supplies
and
rafe
scott
went
out
to
contact
some
friends
of
his
and
arrange
for
details
i
sat
down
with
forth
to
memorize
the
medical
details
i
must
put
so
clearly
to
the
trailmen
if
we
could
only
have
kept
your
medical
knowledge
trouble
is
being
a
doctor
does
suit
my
personality
i
said
i
felt
absurdly
where
i
sat
i
could
raise
my
head
and
study
the
panorama
of
foothills
which
lay
beyond
carthon
and
search
out
the
stone
roadways
like
a
tiny
white
ribbon
which
we
could
follow
for
the
first
stage
of
the
trip
forth
evidently
did
not
share
my
enthusiasm
you
know
jason
there
is
one
real
danger
do
you
think
i
care
about
danger
or
are
you
afraid
turn
foolhardy
not
exactly
it
not
a
physical
danger
jason
it
an
emotional
or
rather
an
intellectual
danger
hell
do
you
know
any
language
but
that
psycho
let
me
finish
jason
jay
allison
may
have
been
repressed
overcontrolled
but
you
are
seriously
impulsive
you
lack
a
if
i
could
put
it
that
way
and
if
you
run
too
many
risks
your
buried
may
come
to
the
surface
and
take
over
in
sheer
in
other
words
i
said
laughing
loudly
if
i
scare
that
allison
he
may
start
stirring
in
his
grave
forth
coughed
and
smothered
a
laugh
and
said
that
was
one
way
of
putting
it
i
clapped
him
reassuringly
on
the
shoulder
and
said
forget
it
sir
i
promise
to
be
godly
sober
and
industrious
but
is
there
any
law
against
enjoying
what
i
doing
somebody
burst
out
of
the
place
and
shouted
at
me
jason
the
guide
is
here
and
i
stood
up
giving
forth
a
final
grin
do
you
worry
jay
allison
good
riddance
i
said
and
went
back
to
meet
the
other
guide
they
had
chosen
and
i
almost
backed
out
when
i
saw
the
guide
for
the
guide
was
a
woman
she
was
small
for
a
darkovan
girl
and
narrowly
built
the
sort
of
body
that
could
have
been
called
boyish
or
coltish
but
certainly
not
at
first
glance
feminine
curls
and
wispy
cast
the
faintest
of
shadows
over
a
squarish
sunburnt
face
and
her
eyes
were
so
thickly
rimmed
with
heavy
dark
lashes
that
i
could
not
guess
their
color
her
nose
was
snubbed
and
might
have
looked
whimsical
and
was
instead
oddly
arrogant
her
mouth
was
wide
and
her
chin
round
and
altogether
i
dismissed
her
as
not
at
all
a
pretty
woman
she
held
up
her
palm
and
said
rather
sullenly
free
amazon
licensed
guide
i
acknowledged
the
gesture
with
a
nod
scowling
the
guild
of
free
amazons
entered
virtually
every
masculine
field
but
that
of
mountain
guide
seemed
somewhat
bizarre
even
for
an
amazon
she
seemed
wiry
and
agile
enough
her
body
under
the
heavy
clothing
almost
as
lean
of
hip
and
flat
of
breast
as
my
own
only
the
slender
long
legs
were
unequivocally
feminine
the
other
men
were
checking
and
loading
supplies
i
noted
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
that
regis
hastur
was
taking
his
turn
heaving
bundles
with
the
rest
i
sat
down
on
some
sacks
and
motioned
her
to
sit
you
had
trail
experience
we
going
into
the
hellers
through
dammerung
and
that
rough
going
even
for
professionals
she
said
in
a
flat
expressionless
voice
i
was
with
the
terran
mapping
expedition
to
the
south
polar
ridge
last
year
ever
been
in
the
hellers
if
anything
happened
to
me
could
you
lead
the
expedition
safely
back
to
carthon
she
looked
down
at
her
stubby
fingers
i
sure
i
could
she
said
finally
and
started
to
rise
is
that
all
one
thing
more
i
gestured
to
her
to
stay
put
kyla
you
be
one
woman
among
eight
men
the
snubbed
nose
wrinkled
up
i
do
expect
you
to
crawl
into
my
blankets
if
that
what
you
mean
it
not
in
my
contract
i
hope
i
felt
my
face
burning
damn
the
girl
it
not
in
mine
anyway
i
snapped
but
i
ca
answer
for
seven
other
men
most
of
them
mountain
roughnecks
even
as
i
said
it
i
wondered
why
i
bothered
certainly
a
free
amazon
could
defend
her
own
virtue
or
not
if
she
wanted
to
without
any
help
from
me
i
had
to
excuse
myself
by
adding
in
either
case
you
be
a
disturbing
element
i
do
want
fights
either
she
made
a
little
sound
of
amusement
there
safety
in
numbers
and
are
you
familiar
with
the
physiological
effect
of
high
altitudes
on
men
acclimated
to
low
ones
suddenly
she
threw
back
her
head
and
the
hidden
sound
became
free
and
merry
laughter
jason
i
a
free
amazon
and
that
means
no
i
not
neutered
though
some
of
us
are
but
you
have
my
word
i
wo
create
any
trouble
of
any
recognizably
female
variety
she
stood
up
now
if
you
do
mind
like
to
check
the
mountain
equipment
her
eyes
were
still
laughing
at
me
but
curiously
i
did
mind
at
all
there
was
a
refreshing
element
in
her
manner
we
started
that
night
a
curiously
lopsided
little
caravan
the
pack
animals
were
loaded
into
one
truck
and
did
like
it
we
had
another
truck
which
carried
supplies
the
ancient
stone
roads
rutted
and
gullied
here
and
there
with
the
and
silt
of
decades
had
not
been
planned
for
any
travel
other
than
the
feet
of
men
or
beasts
we
passed
tiny
villages
and
isolated
country
estates
and
a
few
of
the
solitary
towers
where
the
matrix
mechanics
worked
alone
with
the
secret
sciences
of
darkover
towers
of
glareless
stone
which
sometimes
shone
like
blue
beacons
in
the
dark
kendricks
drove
the
truck
which
carried
the
animals
and
was
amused
by
it
rafe
and
i
took
turns
driving
the
other
truck
sharing
the
wide
front
seat
with
regis
hastur
and
the
girl
kyla
while
the
other
men
found
seats
between
crates
and
sacks
in
the
back
once
while
rafe
was
at
the
wheel
and
the
girl
dozing
with
her
coat
over
her
face
to
shut
out
the
fierce
sun
regis
asked
me
what
are
the
trailcities
like
i
tried
to
tell
him
but
i
never
been
good
at
boiling
things
down
into
descriptions
and
when
he
found
i
was
not
disposed
to
talk
he
fell
silent
and
i
was
free
to
drowse
over
what
i
knew
of
the
trailmen
and
their
world
nature
seems
to
have
a
sameness
on
all
inhabited
worlds
tending
toward
the
economy
and
simplicity
of
the
human
form
the
upright
carriage
freeing
the
hands
the
opposable
thumb
the
of
retinal
rods
and
cones
the
development
of
language
and
of
lengthy
parental
nurture
these
things
seem
to
be
indispensable
to
the
growth
of
civilization
and
in
the
end
they
spell
except
for
minor
variations
depending
on
climate
or
foodstuff
the
inhabitant
of
megaera
or
darkover
is
indistinguishable
from
the
terran
or
sirian
differences
are
mainly
cultural
and
sometimes
an
isolated
culture
will
mutate
in
a
strange
direction
or
remain
atavists
somewhere
halfway
to
the
summit
of
the
ladder
of
evolution
which
at
least
on
the
known
planets
still
reckons
homo
sapiens
as
the
most
complex
of
nature
forms
the
trailmen
were
a
which
had
proved
tenacious
when
the
mainstream
of
evolution
on
darkover
left
the
trees
to
struggle
for
existence
on
the
ground
a
few
remained
behind
evolution
did
not
cease
for
them
but
evolved
nocturnal
nystalopic
humanoids
who
lived
out
their
lives
in
the
extensive
forests
the
truck
bumped
over
the
bad
rutted
roads
the
wind
was
chilly
the
truck
a
mere
conveyance
for
hauling
had
no
such
refinements
of
luxury
as
windows
i
jolted
awake
what
nonsense
had
i
been
thinking
vague
ideas
about
evolution
swirled
in
my
brain
like
burst
bubbles
the
trailmen
they
were
just
the
trailmen
who
could
explain
them
jay
allison
maybe
rafe
turned
his
head
and
asked
where
do
we
pull
up
for
the
night
it
getting
dark
and
we
have
all
this
gear
to
sort
i
roused
myself
and
took
over
the
business
of
the
expedition
again
but
when
the
trucks
had
been
parked
and
a
tent
pitched
and
the
pack
animals
unloaded
and
hobbled
and
a
start
made
at
getting
the
gear
together
when
all
this
had
been
done
i
lay
awake
listening
to
kendricks
heavy
snoring
but
myself
afraid
to
sleep
dozing
in
the
truck
an
odd
lapse
of
consciousness
had
come
over
me
myself
yet
not
myself
drowsing
over
thoughts
i
did
not
recognize
as
my
own
if
i
slept
who
would
i
be
when
i
woke
we
had
made
our
camp
in
the
bend
of
an
enormous
river
wide
and
shallow
and
unbridged
the
river
kadarin
traditionally
a
point
of
no
return
for
humans
on
darkover
the
river
is
fed
by
ocean
tides
and
we
would
have
to
wait
for
low
water
to
cross
beyond
the
river
lay
thick
forests
and
beyond
the
forests
the
slopes
of
the
hellers
rising
upward
and
upward
and
their
every
fold
and
every
valley
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
forest
and
in
the
forests
lived
the
trailmen
but
though
all
this
country
was
thickly
populated
with
outlying
colonies
and
nests
it
would
be
no
use
to
bargain
with
any
of
them
we
must
deal
with
the
old
one
of
the
north
nest
where
i
had
spent
so
many
of
my
boyhood
years
from
time
immemorial
the
trailmen
usually
inoffensive
had
kept
strict
boundaries
marked
between
their
lands
and
the
lands
of
men
they
never
came
beyond
the
kadarin
on
the
other
hand
almost
any
human
who
ventured
into
their
territory
became
by
that
act
fair
game
for
attack
a
few
of
the
darkovan
mountain
people
had
trade
treaties
with
the
trailmen
they
traded
clothing
forged
metals
small
implements
in
return
for
nuts
bark
for
dyestuffs
and
certain
leaves
and
mosses
for
drugs
in
return
the
trailmen
permitted
them
to
hunt
in
the
forest
lands
without
being
molested
but
other
humans
venturing
into
trailman
territory
ran
the
risk
of
merciless
raiding
the
trailmen
were
not
bloodthirsty
and
did
not
kill
for
the
sake
of
killing
but
they
attacked
in
packs
of
two
or
three
dozen
and
their
prey
would
be
stripped
and
plundered
of
everything
portable
travelling
through
their
country
would
be
dangerous
the
sun
was
high
before
we
struck
the
camp
while
the
others
were
packing
up
the
last
oddments
ready
for
the
saddle
i
gave
the
girl
kyla
the
task
of
readying
the
rucksacks
we
carry
after
the
trails
got
too
bad
even
for
the
pack
animals
and
went
to
stand
at
the
water
edge
checking
the
depth
of
the
ford
and
glancing
up
at
the
rifts
between
peak
and
peak
the
men
were
packing
up
the
small
tent
we
use
in
the
forests
moving
around
with
a
good
deal
of
horseplay
and
a
certain
brisk
bustle
they
were
a
good
crew
i
already
discovered
rafe
and
lerrys
and
the
three
darkovan
brothers
were
tireless
cheerful
and
kendricks
obviously
out
of
his
element
could
be
implicitly
relied
on
to
follow
orders
and
i
felt
that
i
could
fall
back
on
him
strange
as
it
seemed
the
very
fact
that
he
was
a
terran
was
vaguely
comforting
where
i
anticipated
it
would
be
a
nuisance
the
girl
kyla
was
still
something
of
an
unknown
quantity
she
was
too
taut
and
quiet
working
her
share
but
seldom
contributing
a
word
we
were
not
yet
in
mountain
country
so
far
she
was
quiet
and
touchy
with
me
although
she
seemed
natural
enough
with
the
darkovans
and
i
let
her
alone
hi
jason
get
a
move
on
someone
shouted
and
i
walked
back
toward
the
clearing
squinting
in
the
sun
it
hurt
and
i
touched
my
face
gingerly
suddenly
realizing
what
had
happened
yesterday
riding
in
the
uncovered
truck
and
this
morning
to
the
fierce
sun
of
these
latitudes
i
had
neglected
to
take
the
proper
precautions
against
exposure
and
my
face
was
reddening
with
sunburn
i
walked
toward
kyla
who
was
cinching
a
final
load
on
one
of
the
which
she
did
efficiently
enough
she
did
wait
for
me
to
ask
but
sized
up
the
situation
with
one
amused
glance
at
my
face
sunburn
put
some
of
this
on
it
she
produced
a
tube
of
white
stuff
i
twisted
at
the
top
inexpertly
and
she
took
it
from
me
squeezed
the
stuff
out
in
her
palm
and
said
stand
still
and
bend
down
your
head
she
smeared
the
mixture
efficiently
across
my
forehead
and
cheeks
it
felt
cold
and
good
i
started
to
thank
her
then
broke
off
as
she
burst
out
laughing
what
the
matter
you
should
see
yourself
she
gurgled
i
was
amused
no
doubt
i
presented
a
grotesque
appearance
and
no
doubt
she
had
the
right
to
laugh
at
it
but
i
scowled
it
hurt
intending
to
put
things
back
on
the
proper
footing
i
demanded
did
you
make
up
the
climbing
loads
all
except
bedding
i
was
sure
how
much
to
allow
she
said
jason
have
you
eyeshades
for
when
you
get
on
snow
i
nodded
and
she
instructed
me
severely
do
forget
them
snowblindness
i
give
you
my
word
is
even
more
unpleasant
than
sunburn
and
painful
damn
it
girl
i
not
stupid
i
exploded
she
said
in
her
expressionless
monotone
again
then
you
to
have
known
better
than
to
get
sunburnt
here
put
this
in
your
pocket
she
handed
me
the
tube
of
sunburn
cream
maybe
i
better
check
up
on
some
of
the
others
and
make
sure
they
have
forgotten
she
went
off
without
another
word
leaving
me
with
an
unpleasant
feeling
that
come
off
best
that
she
considered
me
an
irresponsible
scamp
forth
had
said
almost
the
same
thing
i
told
off
the
darkovan
brothers
to
urge
the
pack
animals
across
the
narrowest
part
of
the
ford
and
gestured
to
corus
and
kyla
to
ride
one
on
either
side
of
kendricks
who
might
not
be
aware
of
the
swirling
treacherous
currents
of
a
mountain
river
rafe
could
not
urge
his
edgy
horse
into
the
water
he
finally
dismounted
took
off
his
boots
and
led
the
creature
across
the
slippery
rocks
i
crossed
last
riding
close
to
regis
hastur
alert
for
dangers
and
thinking
resentfully
that
anyone
so
important
to
darkover
policies
should
not
be
risked
on
such
a
mission
why
if
the
terran
legate
had
unthinkably
come
with
us
he
would
be
surrounded
by
bodyguards
secret
service
men
and
dozens
of
precautions
against
accident
assassination
or
misadventure
all
that
day
we
rode
upward
encamping
at
the
furthest
point
we
could
travel
with
pack
animals
or
mounted
the
next
day
climb
would
enter
the
dangerous
trails
we
must
travel
afoot
we
pitched
a
comfortable
camp
but
i
admit
i
slept
badly
kendricks
and
lerrys
and
rafe
had
blinding
headaches
from
the
sun
and
the
thinness
of
the
air
i
was
more
used
to
these
conditions
but
i
felt
a
sense
of
unpleasant
pressure
and
my
ears
rang
regis
arrogantly
denied
any
discomfort
but
he
moaned
and
cried
out
continuously
in
his
sleep
until
lerrys
kicked
him
after
which
he
was
silent
and
i
feared
sleepless
kyla
seemed
the
least
affected
of
any
probably
she
had
been
at
higher
altitudes
more
continuously
than
any
of
us
but
there
were
dark
circles
beneath
her
eyes
however
no
one
complained
as
we
readied
ourselves
for
the
final
last
long
climb
upward
if
we
were
fortunate
we
could
cross
dammerung
before
nightfall
at
the
very
least
we
should
bivouac
tonight
very
near
the
pass
our
camp
had
been
made
at
the
last
level
spot
we
partially
hobbled
the
pack
animals
so
they
would
not
stray
too
far
and
left
ample
food
for
them
and
cached
all
but
the
most
necessary
of
light
trail
gear
as
we
prepared
to
start
upward
on
the
steep
narrow
track
hardly
more
than
a
i
glanced
at
kyla
and
stated
we
work
on
rope
from
the
first
stretch
starting
now
one
of
the
darkovan
brothers
stared
at
me
with
contempt
call
yourself
a
mountain
man
jason
why
my
little
daughter
could
scramble
up
track
without
so
much
as
a
push
on
her
behind
i
set
my
chin
and
glared
at
him
the
rocks
are
easy
and
some
of
these
men
are
used
to
working
on
rope
at
all
we
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
because
when
we
start
working
along
the
ledges
i
do
want
anybody
who
does
know
how
they
still
did
like
it
but
nobody
protested
further
until
i
directed
the
huge
kendricks
to
the
center
of
the
second
rope
he
glared
viciously
at
the
light
nylon
line
and
demanded
in
some
apprehension
had
i
better
go
last
until
i
know
what
i
doing
hemmed
in
between
the
two
of
you
i
apt
to
do
something
damned
dumb
hjalmar
roared
with
laughter
and
informed
him
that
the
center
place
on
a
rope
was
always
reserved
for
weaklings
novices
and
amateurs
i
expected
kendricks
temper
to
flare
up
the
burly
spaceforce
man
and
the
darkovan
giant
glared
at
one
another
then
kendricks
only
shrugged
and
knotted
the
line
through
his
belt
kyla
warned
kendricks
and
lerrys
about
looking
down
from
ledges
and
we
started
the
first
stretch
was
almost
too
simple
a
clear
track
winding
higher
and
higher
for
a
couple
of
miles
pausing
to
rest
for
a
moment
we
could
turn
and
see
the
entire
valley
outspread
below
us
gradually
the
trail
grew
steeper
in
spots
pitched
almost
at
a
angle
and
was
scattered
with
gravel
loose
rock
and
shale
so
that
we
placed
our
feet
carefully
leaning
forward
to
catch
at
handholds
and
steady
ourselves
against
rocks
i
tested
each
boulder
carefully
since
any
weight
placed
against
an
unsteady
rock
might
dislodge
it
on
somebody
below
one
of
the
darkovan
brothers
vardo
i
thought
was
behind
me
separated
by
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
slack
rope
and
twice
when
his
feet
slipped
on
gravel
he
stumbled
and
gave
me
an
unpleasant
jerk
what
he
muttered
was
perfectly
true
on
slopes
like
this
where
a
fall
was
dangerous
anyhow
it
was
better
to
work
unroped
then
a
slip
bothered
no
one
but
the
slipper
but
i
was
finding
out
what
i
wanted
to
know
what
kind
of
climbers
i
had
to
lead
through
the
hellers
along
a
cliff
face
the
trail
narrowed
horizontally
leading
across
a
ledge
overhanging
a
sheer
drop
of
fifty
feet
and
covered
with
loose
shale
and
scrub
plants
nothing
of
course
to
an
experienced
climber
a
ledge
might
as
well
be
a
superhighway
kendricks
made
a
nervous
joke
about
a
tightrope
walker
but
when
his
turn
came
he
picked
his
way
securely
without
losing
balance
the
amateurs
lerrys
ridenow
regis
rafe
came
across
without
hesitation
but
i
wondered
how
well
they
would
have
done
at
a
less
secure
altitude
to
a
real
mountaineer
a
footpath
is
a
footpath
whether
in
a
meadow
above
a
drop
a
ledge
or
a
sheer
mountain
face
three
miles
above
the
first
level
spot
after
crossing
the
ledge
the
going
was
harder
a
steeper
trail
in
places
nearly
imperceptible
led
between
thick
scrub
and
overhanging
trees
thickly
forested
in
spots
their
twisted
roots
obscured
the
trail
in
others
the
persistent
growth
had
thrust
aside
rocks
and
dirt
we
had
to
make
our
way
through
tangles
of
underbrush
which
would
have
been
nothing
to
a
trailman
but
which
made
our
bodies
ache
with
the
effort
of
getting
over
or
through
them
and
once
the
track
was
totally
blocked
by
a
barricade
of
tangled
dead
brushwood
borne
down
on
floodwater
after
a
sudden
thaw
or
we
had
to
work
painfully
around
it
over
a
rockslide
which
we
could
cross
only
one
at
a
time
leaning
double
to
balance
ourselves
and
no
one
complained
now
about
the
rope
toward
noon
i
had
the
first
intimation
that
we
were
not
alone
on
the
slope
at
first
it
was
no
more
than
a
glimpse
of
motion
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eyes
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
the
fourth
time
i
saw
it
i
called
softly
to
kyla
see
anything
i
was
beginning
to
think
it
was
my
eyes
or
the
altitude
i
saw
jason
look
for
a
spot
where
we
can
take
a
break
i
directed
we
climbed
along
a
shallow
ledge
the
faint
imperceptible
flutters
in
the
brushwood
climbing
with
us
on
either
side
i
muttered
to
the
girl
i
be
glad
when
we
get
clear
of
this
at
least
we
be
able
to
see
what
coming
after
us
if
it
comes
to
a
fight
she
said
surprisingly
i
rather
fight
on
gravel
than
ice
over
a
rise
there
was
a
roaring
sound
kyla
swung
up
and
balanced
on
a
tree
root
cupped
her
mouth
to
her
hands
and
called
rapids
i
pulled
myself
up
to
the
edge
of
the
drop
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
narrow
gully
here
the
narrow
track
we
had
been
following
was
crossed
and
obscured
by
the
deep
roaring
rapids
of
a
mountain
stream
less
than
twenty
feet
across
it
tumbled
in
an
icy
flood
almost
a
waterfall
pitching
over
the
lip
of
a
crag
above
us
it
had
sliced
a
ravine
five
feet
deep
in
the
mountainside
and
came
roaring
down
with
a
rushing
noise
that
made
my
head
vibrate
it
looked
formidable
anyone
stepping
into
it
would
be
knocked
off
his
feet
in
seconds
and
swept
a
thousand
feet
down
the
mountainside
by
the
force
of
the
current
rafe
scrambled
gingerly
over
the
gullied
lip
of
the
channel
it
had
cut
and
bent
carefully
to
scoop
up
water
in
his
palm
and
drink
phew
colder
than
zandru
ninth
hell
must
come
straight
down
from
a
glacier
it
did
i
remembered
the
trail
and
remembered
the
spot
kendricks
joined
me
at
the
water
edge
and
asked
how
do
we
get
across
i
not
sure
i
said
studying
the
racing
white
torrent
overhead
about
twenty
feet
from
where
we
clustered
on
the
slope
the
thick
branches
of
enormous
trees
overhung
the
rapids
their
long
roots
partially
bared
gnarled
and
twisted
by
recurrent
floods
and
between
these
trees
swayed
one
of
the
queer
of
the
trailmen
hanging
only
about
ten
feet
above
the
water
even
i
had
never
learned
to
navigate
one
of
these
without
assistance
human
arms
are
no
longer
suited
to
brachiation
i
might
have
managed
it
once
but
at
present
except
as
a
desperate
final
expedient
it
was
out
of
the
question
rafe
or
lerrys
who
were
lightly
built
and
acrobatic
could
probably
do
it
as
a
simple
stunt
on
the
level
in
a
field
on
a
steep
and
rocky
mountainside
where
a
fall
might
mean
being
dashed
a
thousand
feet
down
the
torrent
i
doubted
it
the
bridge
was
out
but
what
other
choice
was
there
i
beckoned
to
kendricks
he
being
the
man
i
was
the
most
inclined
to
trust
with
my
life
at
the
moment
and
said
it
looks
uncrossable
but
i
think
two
men
could
get
across
if
they
were
steady
on
their
feet
the
others
can
hold
us
on
ropes
in
case
we
do
get
knocked
down
if
we
can
get
to
the
opposite
bank
we
can
stretch
a
fixed
rope
from
that
snub
of
rock
i
pointed
and
the
others
can
cross
with
that
the
first
men
over
will
be
the
only
ones
to
run
any
risk
want
to
try
i
liked
it
better
that
he
did
answer
right
away
but
went
to
the
edge
of
the
gully
and
peered
down
the
rocky
chasm
doubtless
if
we
were
knocked
down
all
seven
of
the
others
could
haul
us
up
again
but
not
before
we
been
badly
smashed
on
the
rocks
and
once
again
i
caught
that
elusive
shadow
of
movement
in
the
brushwood
if
the
trailmen
chose
a
moment
when
we
were
of
the
rapids
we
be
ridiculously
vulnerable
to
attack
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
fixed
rope
easier
than
that
hjalmar
said
and
took
one
of
the
spares
from
his
rucksack
he
coiled
it
making
a
running
loop
on
one
end
and
standing
precariously
on
the
lip
of
the
rapids
sent
it
spinning
toward
the
outcrop
of
rock
we
had
chosen
as
a
fixed
point
if
i
can
get
it
over
the
rope
fell
short
and
hjalmar
reeled
it
in
and
cast
the
loop
again
he
made
three
more
unsuccessful
tries
before
finally
with
held
breath
we
watched
the
noose
settle
over
the
rocky
snub
gently
pulling
the
line
taut
we
watched
it
stretch
above
the
rapids
the
knot
tightened
fastened
hjalmar
grinned
and
let
out
his
breath
there
he
said
and
jerked
hard
on
the
rope
testing
it
with
a
long
hard
pull
the
rocky
outcrop
broke
with
a
sharp
crack
split
and
toppled
entirely
into
the
rapids
the
sudden
jerk
almost
pulling
hjalmar
off
his
feet
the
boulder
rolled
with
a
great
bouncing
splash
faster
and
faster
down
the
mountain
taking
the
rope
with
it
we
just
stood
and
stared
for
a
minute
hjalmar
swore
horribly
in
the
unprintable
filth
of
the
mountain
tongue
and
his
brothers
joined
in
how
the
devil
was
i
to
know
the
would
split
off
better
for
it
to
split
now
than
when
we
were
depending
on
it
kyla
said
stolidly
i
have
a
better
idea
she
was
untying
herself
from
the
rope
as
she
spoke
and
knotting
one
of
the
spares
through
her
belt
she
handed
the
other
end
of
the
rope
to
lerrys
hold
on
to
this
she
said
and
slipped
out
of
her
blankety
windbreak
standing
shivering
in
a
thin
sweater
she
unstrapped
her
boots
and
tossed
them
to
me
now
boost
me
on
your
shoulders
hjalmar
too
late
i
guessed
her
intention
and
shouted
no
do
try
but
she
had
already
clambered
to
an
unsteady
perch
on
the
big
shoulders
and
made
a
flying
grab
for
the
lowest
loop
of
the
bridge
she
hung
there
swaying
slightly
and
sickeningly
as
the
loose
lianas
gave
to
her
weight
hjalmar
lerrys
haul
her
down
i
lighter
than
any
of
you
kyla
called
shrilly
and
not
hefty
enough
to
be
any
use
on
the
ropes
her
voice
quavered
somewhat
as
she
added
and
hang
on
to
that
rope
lerrys
if
you
lose
it
i
have
done
this
for
nothing
she
gripped
the
loop
of
vine
and
reached
with
her
free
hand
for
the
next
loop
now
she
was
swinging
out
over
the
edge
of
the
boiling
rapids
i
gestured
to
the
others
to
spread
out
slightly
below
not
that
anything
would
help
her
if
she
fell
hjalmar
watching
as
the
woman
gained
the
third
loop
which
joggled
horribly
to
her
slight
weight
shouted
suddenly
kyla
quick
the
loop
do
touch
the
next
one
it
frayed
rotted
through
kyla
brought
her
left
hand
up
to
her
right
on
the
third
loop
she
made
a
long
reach
missed
her
grab
swung
again
and
clung
breathing
hard
to
the
safe
fifth
loop
i
watched
sick
with
dread
the
damned
girl
should
have
told
me
what
she
intended
kyla
glanced
down
and
we
got
a
glimpse
of
her
face
glistening
with
the
mixture
of
sunburn
cream
and
sweat
drawn
with
effort
her
tiny
swaying
figure
hung
twelve
feet
above
the
white
tumbling
water
and
if
she
lost
her
grip
only
a
miracle
could
bring
her
out
alive
she
hung
there
for
a
minute
jiggling
slightly
then
started
a
long
swing
on
the
third
forward
swing
she
made
a
long
leap
and
grabbed
at
the
final
loop
it
slipped
through
her
fingers
she
made
a
wild
grab
with
the
other
hand
and
the
liana
dipped
sharply
under
her
weight
raced
through
her
fingers
and
with
a
sharp
snap
broke
in
two
she
gave
a
wild
shriek
as
it
parted
and
twisted
her
body
frantically
in
landing
asprawl
of
the
rapids
but
on
the
further
bank
she
hauled
her
legs
up
on
dry
land
and
crouched
there
drenched
to
the
waist
but
safe
illustration
the
rope
swung
perilously
threatening
to
dash
her
on
the
rocks
the
darkovans
were
yelling
in
delight
i
motioned
to
lerrys
to
make
his
end
of
the
rope
fast
around
a
hefty
and
shouted
are
you
hurt
she
indicated
in
pantomime
that
the
thundering
of
the
water
drowned
words
and
bent
to
belay
her
end
of
the
rope
in
i
gestured
to
her
to
make
very
sure
of
the
knots
if
anyone
slipped
she
had
the
weight
to
hold
us
i
hauled
on
the
rope
myself
to
test
it
and
it
held
fast
i
slung
her
boots
around
my
neck
by
their
cords
then
gripping
the
fixed
rope
kendricks
and
i
stepped
into
the
water
it
was
even
icier
than
i
expected
and
my
first
step
was
nearly
the
last
the
rush
of
the
white
water
knocked
me
to
my
knees
and
i
floundered
and
would
have
measured
my
length
except
for
my
hands
on
the
fixed
rope
buck
kendricks
grabbed
at
me
letting
go
the
rope
to
do
it
and
i
swore
at
him
raging
while
we
got
on
our
feet
again
and
braced
ourselves
against
the
onrushing
current
while
we
struggled
in
the
pounding
waters
i
admitted
to
myself
we
could
never
have
crossed
without
the
rope
kyla
had
risked
her
life
to
fix
shivering
we
got
across
and
hauled
ourselves
out
i
signalled
to
the
others
to
cross
two
at
a
time
and
kyla
seized
my
elbow
jason
later
dammit
i
had
to
shout
to
make
myself
heard
over
the
roaring
water
as
i
held
out
a
hand
to
help
rafe
get
his
footing
on
the
ledge
this
ca
wait
she
yelled
cupping
her
hands
and
shouting
into
my
ear
i
turned
on
her
there
are
on
the
top
level
of
that
bridge
i
saw
them
they
cut
the
loop
regis
and
hjalmar
came
struggling
across
last
regis
was
swept
off
his
feet
and
hjalmar
turned
to
grab
him
but
i
shouted
to
him
to
keep
clear
they
were
still
roped
together
and
if
the
ropes
fouled
we
might
drown
someone
lerrys
and
i
leaped
down
and
hauled
regis
clear
he
coughed
spitting
icy
water
drenched
to
the
skin
i
motioned
to
lerrys
to
leave
the
fixed
rope
though
i
had
little
hope
that
it
would
be
there
when
we
returned
and
looked
quickly
around
debating
what
to
do
regis
and
rafe
and
i
were
wet
clear
through
the
others
to
well
above
the
knee
at
this
altitude
this
was
dangerous
although
we
were
not
yet
high
enough
to
worry
about
frostbite
trailmen
or
no
trailmen
we
must
run
the
lesser
risk
of
finding
a
place
where
we
could
kindle
a
fire
and
dry
out
up
there
there
a
clearing
i
said
briefly
and
hurried
them
along
it
was
hard
climbing
now
on
rock
and
there
were
places
where
we
had
to
scrabble
for
handholds
and
flatten
ourselves
out
against
an
almost
sheer
wall
the
keen
wind
rose
as
we
climbed
higher
whining
through
the
thick
forest
soughing
in
the
rocky
outcrops
and
biting
through
our
soaked
clothing
with
icy
teeth
kendricks
was
having
hard
going
now
and
i
helped
him
as
much
as
i
could
but
i
was
aching
with
cold
we
gained
the
clearing
a
small
bare
spot
on
a
lesser
peak
and
i
directed
the
two
darkovan
brothers
who
were
the
driest
to
gather
dry
brushwood
and
get
a
fire
going
it
was
hardly
near
enough
sunset
to
camp
but
by
the
time
we
were
dry
enough
to
go
on
safely
it
would
be
so
i
gave
orders
to
get
the
tent
up
then
rounded
angrily
on
kyla
see
here
another
time
do
try
any
dangerous
tricks
unless
ordered
to
go
easy
on
her
regis
hastur
interceded
we
never
have
crossed
without
the
fixed
rope
good
work
girl
you
keep
out
of
this
i
snapped
it
was
true
yet
resentment
boiled
in
me
as
kyla
plain
sullen
face
glowed
under
the
praise
from
the
hastur
the
fact
was
i
admitted
it
grudgingly
a
lightweight
like
kyla
ran
less
risk
on
an
acrobat
bridge
than
in
that
kind
of
roaring
current
that
did
not
lessen
my
annoyance
and
regis
hastur
interference
and
the
foolish
grin
on
the
girl
face
made
me
boil
over
i
wanted
to
question
her
further
about
the
sight
of
trailmen
on
the
bridge
but
decided
against
it
we
had
been
spared
attack
on
the
rapids
so
it
was
impossible
that
a
group
not
hostile
was
simply
watching
our
progress
maybe
even
aware
that
we
were
on
a
peaceful
mission
but
i
did
believe
it
for
a
minute
if
i
knew
anything
about
the
trailmen
it
was
this
one
could
not
judge
them
by
human
standards
at
all
i
tried
to
decide
what
i
would
have
done
as
a
trailman
but
my
brain
would
run
that
way
at
the
moment
the
darkovan
brothers
had
built
up
the
fire
with
a
thoroughly
reckless
disregard
of
watching
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
morale
and
fitness
of
the
shivering
crew
was
of
more
value
at
the
moment
than
caution
and
around
the
roaring
fire
feeling
my
soaked
clothes
warming
to
the
blaze
and
drinking
boiling
hot
tea
from
a
mug
it
seemed
that
we
were
right
optimism
reappeared
kyla
letting
hjalmar
dress
her
hands
which
had
been
rubbed
raw
by
the
slipping
lianas
made
jokes
with
the
men
about
her
feat
of
acrobatics
we
had
made
camp
on
the
summit
of
an
outlying
arm
of
the
main
ridge
of
the
hellers
and
the
whole
massive
range
lay
before
our
eyes
turned
to
a
million
colors
in
the
declining
sun
green
and
turquoise
and
rose
the
mountains
were
even
more
beautiful
than
i
remembered
the
shoulder
of
the
high
slope
we
had
just
climbed
had
obscured
the
real
mountain
massif
from
our
sight
and
i
saw
kendricks
eyes
widen
as
he
realized
that
this
high
summit
we
had
just
mastered
was
only
the
first
step
of
the
task
which
lay
before
us
the
real
ridge
rose
ahead
thickly
forested
on
the
lower
slopes
then
strewn
with
rock
and
granite
like
the
landscape
of
an
airless
deserted
moon
and
above
the
rock
there
were
straight
walls
capped
with
blinding
snow
and
ice
down
one
peak
a
glacier
flowed
a
waterfall
a
cascade
shockingly
arrested
in
motion
i
murmured
the
trailman
name
for
the
mountain
aloud
and
translated
it
for
the
others
the
wall
around
the
world
good
name
for
it
lerrys
murmured
coming
with
his
mug
in
his
hand
to
look
at
the
mountain
jason
the
big
peak
there
has
never
been
climbed
has
it
i
ca
remember
my
teeth
were
chattering
and
i
went
back
toward
the
fire
regis
surveyed
the
distant
glacier
and
murmured
it
does
look
too
bad
there
could
be
a
route
along
that
western
hjalmar
were
you
with
the
expedition
that
climbed
and
mapped
high
kimbi
the
giant
nodded
rather
proudly
we
got
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
top
then
a
snowstorm
came
up
and
we
had
to
turn
back
some
day
tackle
the
wall
around
the
world
it
been
tried
but
no
one
ever
climbed
the
peak
no
one
ever
will
lerrys
stated
positively
there
two
hundred
feet
of
sheer
rock
cliff
prince
regis
you
need
wings
to
get
up
and
there
the
avalanche
ledge
they
call
hell
alley
kendricks
broke
in
irritably
i
do
care
whether
it
ever
been
climbed
or
ever
will
be
climbed
we
not
going
to
climb
it
now
he
stared
at
me
and
added
i
hope
we
not
i
was
glad
of
the
interruption
if
the
youngsters
and
amateurs
wanted
to
amuse
themselves
plotting
hypothetical
attacks
on
unclimbable
sierras
that
was
all
very
well
but
it
was
if
nothing
worse
a
great
waste
of
time
i
showed
kendricks
a
notch
in
the
ridge
thousands
of
feet
lower
than
the
peaks
and
from
the
icefalls
on
either
side
that
dammerung
we
going
through
there
we
wo
be
on
the
mountain
at
all
and
it
less
than
feet
high
in
the
pass
although
there
are
some
bad
ledges
and
washes
we
keep
clear
of
the
main
if
we
can
and
all
the
mapped
trailmen
villages
but
we
may
run
into
wandering
bands
abruptly
i
made
my
decision
and
gestured
them
around
me
from
this
point
i
broke
the
news
we
liable
to
be
attacked
kyla
tell
them
what
you
saw
she
put
down
her
mug
her
face
was
serious
again
as
she
related
what
she
had
seen
on
the
bridge
we
on
a
peaceful
mission
but
they
know
that
yet
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
they
do
not
wish
to
kill
only
to
wound
and
rob
if
we
show
fight
she
displayed
a
short
ugly
knife
which
she
tucked
into
her
they
will
run
away
again
lerrys
loosened
a
narrow
dagger
which
until
this
moment
i
had
thought
purely
ornamental
he
said
mind
if
i
say
something
more
jason
i
remember
from
the
campaign
the
trailmen
fight
at
close
quarters
and
by
human
standards
they
fight
dirty
he
looked
around
fiercely
his
unshaven
face
glinting
as
he
grinned
one
more
thing
i
like
elbow
room
do
we
have
to
stay
roped
together
when
we
start
out
again
i
thought
it
over
his
enthusiasm
for
a
fight
made
me
feel
both
annoyed
and
curiously
delighted
i
wo
make
anyone
stay
roped
who
thinks
be
safer
without
it
i
said
we
decide
that
when
the
time
comes
anyway
but
personally
the
trailmen
are
used
to
running
along
narrow
ledges
and
we
not
their
first
tactic
would
probably
be
to
push
us
off
one
by
one
if
we
roped
we
can
fend
them
off
better
i
dismissed
the
subject
adding
just
now
the
important
thing
is
to
dry
out
kendricks
remained
at
my
side
after
the
others
had
gathered
around
the
fire
looking
into
the
thick
forest
which
sloped
up
to
our
campsite
he
said
this
place
looks
as
if
it
had
been
used
for
a
camp
before
we
just
as
vulnerable
to
attack
here
as
we
would
be
anywhere
else
he
had
hit
on
the
one
thing
i
had
wanted
to
talk
about
this
clearing
was
altogether
too
convenient
i
only
said
at
least
there
are
so
many
ledges
to
push
us
off
kendricks
muttered
you
got
the
only
blaster
i
left
it
at
carthon
i
said
truthfully
then
i
laid
down
the
law
listen
buck
if
we
kill
a
single
trailman
except
in
fight
in
we
might
as
well
pack
up
and
go
home
we
on
a
peaceful
mission
and
we
begging
a
favor
even
if
we
attacked
we
kill
only
as
a
last
resort
and
in
combat
damned
primitive
frontier
planet
would
you
rather
die
of
the
trailmen
disease
he
said
savagely
we
apt
to
catch
it
anyway
here
you
immune
you
do
care
you
safe
the
rest
of
us
are
on
a
suicide
mission
and
damn
it
when
i
die
i
want
to
take
a
few
of
those
monkeys
with
me
i
bent
my
head
bit
my
lip
and
said
nothing
buck
could
be
blamed
for
the
way
he
felt
after
a
moment
i
pointed
to
the
notch
in
the
ridge
again
it
not
so
far
once
we
get
through
dammerung
it
easy
going
into
the
trailmen
city
beyond
there
it
all
civilized
maybe
call
it
civilization
kendricks
said
and
turned
away
come
on
let
finish
drying
our
feet
and
at
that
moment
they
hit
us
kendricks
yell
was
the
only
warning
i
had
before
i
was
fighting
away
something
scrabbling
up
my
back
i
whirled
and
ripped
the
creature
away
and
saw
dimly
that
the
clearing
was
filled
to
the
rim
with
an
explosion
of
furry
white
bodies
i
cupped
my
hands
and
yelled
in
the
only
trailman
dialect
i
knew
hold
off
we
come
in
peace
one
of
them
yelled
something
unintelligible
and
plunged
at
me
another
tribe
i
saw
a
chinless
face
contorted
in
rage
a
small
ugly
knife
a
female
i
ripped
out
my
own
knife
fending
away
a
savage
slash
something
tore
across
the
knuckles
of
my
hand
the
fingers
went
limp
and
my
knife
fell
and
the
trailman
woman
snatched
it
up
and
made
off
with
her
prize
swinging
lithely
upward
into
the
treetops
i
searched
quickly
gripped
with
my
good
hand
at
the
bleeding
knuckles
and
found
regis
hastur
struggling
at
the
edge
of
a
ledge
with
a
pair
of
the
creatures
the
crazy
thought
ran
through
my
mind
that
if
they
killed
him
all
darkover
would
rise
and
exterminate
the
trailmen
and
it
would
all
be
my
fault
then
regis
tore
one
hand
free
and
made
a
curious
motion
with
his
fingers
it
looked
like
an
immense
green
spark
a
foot
long
or
like
a
fireball
it
exploded
in
one
creature
white
face
and
she
gave
a
wild
howl
of
terror
and
anguish
scrabbled
blindly
at
her
eyes
and
with
a
despairing
shriek
ran
for
the
shelter
of
the
trees
the
pack
of
trailmen
gave
a
long
formless
wail
and
then
they
were
gathering
flying
retreating
into
the
shadows
rafe
yelled
something
obscene
and
then
a
bolt
of
bluish
flame
lanced
toward
the
retreating
pack
one
of
the
humanoids
fell
without
a
cry
pitching
senseless
over
the
ledge
i
ran
toward
rafe
struggling
with
him
for
the
shocker
he
had
drawn
from
its
inside
his
shirt
you
blind
damned
fool
i
cursed
him
you
may
have
ruined
everything
they
have
killed
him
without
it
he
retorted
wrathfully
he
had
evidently
failed
to
see
how
efficiently
regis
defended
himself
rafe
motioned
toward
the
fleeing
pack
and
sneered
why
do
you
go
with
your
friends
with
a
grip
i
thought
i
had
forgotten
i
got
my
hand
around
knuckles
and
squeezed
his
hand
went
limp
and
i
snatched
the
shocker
and
pitched
it
over
the
ledge
one
word
and
i
pitch
you
after
it
i
warned
who
hurt
garin
was
blinking
senselessly
by
a
blow
regis
forehead
had
been
gashed
and
dripped
blood
and
hjalmar
thigh
sliced
in
a
clean
cut
my
own
knuckles
were
laid
bare
and
the
hand
was
getting
numb
it
was
a
little
while
before
anybody
noticed
kyla
crouched
over
speechless
with
pain
she
reeled
and
turned
deathly
white
when
we
touched
her
we
stretched
her
out
where
she
was
and
got
her
shirt
off
and
kendricks
crowded
up
beside
us
to
examine
the
wound
a
clean
cut
he
said
but
i
did
hear
something
had
turned
over
inside
me
like
a
hand
stirring
up
my
brain
and
jay
allison
looked
around
with
a
gasp
of
sudden
vertigo
he
was
not
in
forth
office
but
standing
precariously
near
the
edge
of
a
cliff
he
shut
his
eyes
briefly
wondering
if
he
were
having
one
of
his
worst
nightmares
and
opened
them
on
a
familiar
face
buck
kendricks
was
his
mouth
widening
as
he
said
hoarsely
jay
doctor
allison
for
god
sake
a
doctor
training
creates
reactions
that
are
almost
reflexes
jay
allison
recovered
some
degree
of
sanity
as
he
became
aware
that
someone
was
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
bleeding
profusely
he
motioned
away
the
crowding
strangers
and
said
in
his
bad
darkovan
let
her
alone
this
is
my
work
he
did
know
enough
words
to
curse
them
away
so
he
switched
to
terran
speaking
to
kendricks
buck
get
these
people
away
give
the
patient
some
air
where
my
surgical
case
he
bent
and
probed
briefly
realizing
only
now
that
the
injured
was
a
woman
and
young
the
wound
was
only
a
superficial
laceration
whatever
sharp
instrument
had
inflicted
it
had
turned
on
the
costal
bone
without
penetrating
lung
tissue
it
could
have
been
sutured
but
kendricks
handed
him
only
a
kit
so
allison
covered
it
tightly
with
a
plastic
which
would
seal
it
from
further
bleeding
and
let
it
alone
by
the
time
he
had
finished
the
strange
girl
had
begun
to
stir
she
said
haltingly
jason
allison
he
corrected
tersely
surprised
in
a
minor
way
the
major
surprise
had
blurred
lesser
ones
that
she
knew
his
name
kendricks
spoke
swiftly
to
the
girl
in
one
of
the
darkovan
languages
jay
understand
and
then
drew
jay
aside
out
of
earshot
he
said
in
a
shaken
voice
jay
i
did
know
i
would
have
believed
you
good
lord
jason
and
then
he
moved
fast
what
the
matter
oh
hell
jay
do
faint
on
me
jay
was
aware
that
he
did
come
out
of
it
too
bravely
but
anyone
who
blamed
him
he
thought
resentfully
should
try
it
on
for
size
going
to
sleep
in
a
comfortably
office
and
waking
up
on
a
cliff
at
the
outer
edges
of
nowhere
his
hand
hurt
he
saw
that
it
was
bleeding
and
flexed
it
experimentally
trying
to
determine
that
no
tendons
had
been
injured
he
rapped
how
did
this
happen
sir
keep
your
voice
down
or
speak
darkovan
jay
blinked
again
kendricks
was
still
the
only
familiar
thing
in
a
strangely
vertiginous
universe
the
spaceforce
man
said
huskily
before
heaven
jay
i
had
any
idea
and
i
known
you
how
long
eight
nine
years
jay
said
that
idiot
forth
and
swore
the
colorless
profanity
of
an
indoor
man
somebody
shouted
jason
in
an
imperative
voice
and
kendricks
said
shakily
jay
if
they
see
you
you
literally
are
not
the
same
man
obviously
not
jay
looked
at
the
tent
one
pole
still
unpitched
anyone
in
there
not
yet
kendricks
almost
shoved
him
inside
i
tell
them
tell
them
something
he
took
a
radiant
from
his
pocket
set
it
down
and
stared
at
allison
in
the
flickering
light
and
said
something
profane
you
you
be
all
right
here
jay
nodded
it
was
all
he
could
manage
he
was
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
his
nerve
if
it
went
he
start
to
rave
like
a
madman
a
little
time
passed
there
were
strange
noises
outside
and
then
there
was
a
polite
cough
and
a
man
walked
into
the
tent
he
was
obviously
a
darkovan
aristocrat
and
looked
vaguely
familiar
though
jay
had
no
conscious
memory
of
seeing
him
before
tall
and
slender
he
possessed
that
perfect
and
exquisite
masculine
beauty
sometimes
seen
among
darkovans
and
he
spoke
to
jay
familiarly
but
with
surprising
courtesy
i
have
told
them
you
are
not
to
be
disturbed
for
a
moment
that
your
hand
is
worse
than
we
believed
a
surgeon
hands
are
delicate
things
doctor
allison
and
i
hope
that
yours
are
not
badly
injured
will
you
let
me
look
jay
allison
drew
back
his
hand
automatically
then
conscious
of
the
churlishness
of
the
gesture
let
the
stranger
take
it
in
his
and
look
at
the
fingers
the
man
said
it
does
not
seem
serious
i
was
sure
it
was
something
more
than
that
he
raised
grave
eyes
you
do
even
remember
my
name
do
you
dr
allison
you
know
who
i
am
dr
forth
did
tell
me
but
we
hasturs
are
partly
telepathic
jason
forgive
me
doctor
allison
i
have
known
from
the
first
that
you
were
possessed
by
a
god
or
daemon
superstitious
rubbish
jay
snapped
typical
of
a
darkovan
it
is
a
convenient
manner
of
speaking
no
more
said
the
young
hastur
overlooking
the
rudeness
i
suppose
i
could
learn
your
terminology
if
i
considered
it
worth
the
effort
i
have
had
psi
training
and
i
can
tell
the
difference
when
half
of
a
man
soul
has
driven
out
the
other
half
perhaps
i
can
restore
you
to
yourself
if
you
think
i
have
some
darkovan
freak
meddling
with
my
mind
jay
began
hotly
then
stopped
under
regis
grave
eyes
he
felt
a
surge
of
unfamiliar
humility
this
crew
of
men
needed
their
leader
and
obviously
he
jay
allison
was
the
leader
they
needed
he
covered
his
eyes
with
one
hand
regis
bent
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
compassionately
but
jay
twitched
it
off
and
his
voice
when
he
found
it
was
bitter
and
defensive
and
cold
all
right
the
work
the
thing
i
ca
do
it
jason
can
you
a
parapsych
if
you
can
switch
me
off
go
right
ahead
i
stared
at
regis
passing
a
hand
across
my
forehead
what
happened
i
demanded
and
in
even
swifter
apprehension
where
kyla
she
was
hurt
kyla
all
right
regis
said
but
i
got
up
quickly
to
make
sure
kyla
was
outside
lying
quite
comfortably
on
a
roll
of
blankets
she
was
propped
on
her
elbow
drinking
something
hot
and
there
was
a
good
smell
of
hot
food
in
the
air
i
stared
at
regis
and
demanded
i
did
conk
out
did
i
from
a
little
scratch
like
this
i
looked
carelessly
at
my
gashed
hand
wait
regis
held
me
back
do
go
out
just
yet
do
you
remember
what
happened
doctor
allison
i
stared
in
growing
horror
my
worst
fear
confirmed
regis
said
quietly
you
changed
probably
from
the
shock
of
seeing
he
stopped
in
and
i
said
the
last
thing
i
remember
is
seeing
that
kyla
was
bleeding
when
we
got
her
clothes
off
but
good
gods
a
little
blood
would
scare
and
jay
allison
a
surgeon
would
it
bring
him
roaring
up
like
that
i
could
say
regis
looked
as
if
he
knew
more
than
he
was
telling
i
do
believe
that
allison
he
not
much
like
you
was
very
concerned
with
kyla
are
you
damn
right
i
am
i
want
to
make
sure
she
all
right
i
stopped
abruptly
regis
did
they
all
see
it
only
kendricks
and
i
regis
said
and
we
will
not
speak
of
it
i
said
thanks
and
felt
his
reassuring
damn
it
demigod
or
prince
i
regis
i
went
out
and
accepted
some
food
from
the
kettle
and
sat
down
between
kyla
and
kendricks
to
eat
i
was
shaken
weak
with
reaction
furthermore
i
realized
that
we
could
stay
here
it
was
too
vulnerable
to
attack
so
in
our
present
condition
were
we
if
we
could
push
on
hard
enough
to
get
near
dammerung
pass
tonight
then
tomorrow
we
could
cross
it
early
before
the
sun
warmed
the
snow
and
we
had
snowslides
and
slush
to
deal
with
beyond
dammerung
i
knew
the
tribesmen
and
could
speak
their
language
i
mentioned
this
and
kendricks
looked
doubtfully
at
kyla
can
she
climb
can
she
stay
here
i
countered
but
i
went
and
sat
beside
her
anyhow
how
badly
are
you
hurt
do
you
think
you
can
travel
she
said
fiercely
of
course
i
can
climb
i
tell
you
i
no
weak
girl
i
a
free
amazon
she
flung
off
the
blanket
somebody
had
tucked
around
her
legs
her
lips
looked
a
little
pinched
but
the
long
stride
was
steady
as
she
walked
to
the
fire
and
demanded
more
soup
we
struck
the
camp
in
minutes
the
trailmen
band
of
raiding
females
had
snatched
up
almost
everything
portable
and
there
was
no
sense
in
striking
and
caching
the
tent
they
return
and
hunt
it
out
if
we
came
back
with
a
trailmen
escort
we
would
need
it
anyway
i
ordered
them
to
leave
everything
but
the
lightest
gear
and
examined
each
remaining
rucksack
rations
for
the
night
we
would
spend
in
the
pass
our
few
remaining
blankets
ropes
sunglasses
everything
else
i
ruthlessly
ordered
left
behind
it
was
harder
going
now
for
one
thing
the
sun
was
lowering
and
the
evening
wind
was
icy
nearly
everyone
of
us
had
some
hurt
slight
in
itself
which
hindered
us
in
climbing
kyla
was
white
and
rigid
but
did
not
spare
herself
kendricks
was
suffering
severely
from
mountain
sickness
at
this
altitude
and
i
gave
him
all
the
help
i
could
but
with
my
stiffening
slashed
hand
i
was
having
too
easy
a
time
myself
there
was
one
expanse
that
was
sheer
flattened
like
bugs
against
a
wall
scrabbling
for
and
footholds
i
felt
it
a
point
of
pride
to
lead
and
i
led
but
by
the
time
we
had
climbed
the
wall
and
scrambled
along
a
ledge
to
where
we
could
pick
up
the
trail
again
i
was
ready
to
give
over
crowding
together
on
the
ledge
i
changed
places
with
the
veteran
lerrys
who
was
better
than
most
professional
climbers
he
muttered
i
thought
you
said
this
was
a
i
stretched
my
mouth
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
grin
and
did
quite
make
it
for
the
trailmen
this
is
a
superhighway
and
no
one
else
ever
comes
this
way
now
we
climbed
slowly
over
snow
once
or
twice
we
had
to
flounder
through
drifts
and
once
a
brief
bitter
snowstorm
blotted
out
sight
for
twenty
minutes
while
we
hugged
each
other
on
the
ledge
clinging
wildly
against
wind
and
icy
sleet
we
bivouacked
that
night
in
a
crevasse
blown
almost
clean
of
snow
well
above
the
where
only
scrubby
unkillable
thornbushes
clustered
we
tore
down
some
of
them
and
piled
them
up
as
a
windbreak
and
bedded
beneath
it
but
we
all
thought
with
aching
regret
of
the
comfort
of
the
camp
gear
we
abandoned
the
going
had
gotten
good
and
rough
that
night
remains
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
most
miserable
in
memory
except
for
the
slight
ringing
in
my
ears
the
height
alone
did
not
bother
me
but
the
others
did
not
fare
so
well
most
of
the
men
had
blinding
headaches
kyla
slashed
side
must
have
given
her
considerable
pain
and
kendricks
had
succumbed
to
in
its
most
agonizing
form
severe
cramps
and
vomiting
i
was
desperately
uneasy
about
all
of
them
but
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
the
only
cure
for
is
oxygen
or
a
lower
altitude
neither
of
which
was
practical
in
the
windbreak
we
doubled
up
sharing
blankets
and
body
warmth
i
took
a
last
look
around
the
close
space
before
crawling
in
beside
kendricks
and
saw
the
girl
bedding
down
slightly
apart
from
the
others
i
started
to
say
something
but
kendricks
spoke
first
voicing
my
thoughts
better
crawl
in
with
us
girl
he
added
coldly
but
not
unkindly
you
need
worry
about
any
funny
stuff
kyla
gave
me
just
the
flicker
of
a
grin
and
i
realized
she
was
including
me
on
the
darkovan
side
of
a
joke
against
this
big
man
who
was
so
unaware
of
darkovan
etiquette
but
her
voice
was
cool
and
curt
as
she
said
i
not
worrying
and
loosened
her
heavy
coat
slightly
before
creeping
into
the
nest
of
blankets
between
us
it
was
painfully
cramped
and
chilly
in
spite
of
the
blankets
we
crowded
close
together
and
kyla
head
rested
on
my
shoulder
i
felt
her
snuggle
closely
to
me
half
asleep
hunting
for
a
warm
place
and
i
found
myself
very
much
aware
of
her
closeness
curiously
grateful
to
her
an
ordinary
woman
would
have
protested
if
only
as
a
matter
of
form
sharing
blankets
with
two
strange
men
i
realized
that
if
kyla
had
refused
to
crawl
in
with
us
she
would
have
called
attention
to
her
sex
much
than
she
did
by
behaving
as
if
she
were
in
fact
male
she
shivered
convulsively
and
i
whispered
side
hurting
are
you
cold
a
little
it
been
a
long
time
since
i
been
at
these
altitudes
too
what
it
really
is
i
ca
get
those
women
out
of
my
head
kendricks
coughed
moving
uncomfortably
i
do
understand
those
creatures
who
attacked
us
all
women
i
explained
briefly
among
the
people
of
the
sky
as
everywhere
more
females
are
born
than
males
but
the
trailmen
lives
are
so
balanced
that
they
have
no
room
for
extra
females
within
the
nests
the
cities
so
when
a
girl
child
of
the
sky
people
reaches
womanhood
the
other
women
drive
her
out
of
the
city
with
kicks
and
blows
and
she
has
to
wander
in
the
forest
until
some
male
comes
after
her
and
claims
her
and
brings
her
back
as
his
own
then
she
can
never
be
driven
forth
again
although
if
she
bears
no
children
she
can
be
forced
to
be
a
servant
to
his
other
wives
kendricks
made
a
little
sound
of
disgust
you
think
it
cruel
kyla
said
with
sudden
passion
but
in
the
forest
they
can
live
and
find
their
own
food
they
will
not
starve
or
die
many
of
them
prefer
the
forest
life
to
living
in
the
nests
and
they
will
fight
away
any
male
who
comes
near
them
we
who
call
ourselves
human
often
make
less
provision
for
our
spare
women
she
was
silent
sighing
as
if
with
pain
kendricks
made
no
reply
except
a
grunt
i
held
myself
back
by
main
force
from
touching
kyla
remembering
what
she
was
and
finally
said
we
better
quit
talking
the
others
want
to
sleep
if
we
do
after
a
time
i
heard
kendricks
snoring
and
kyla
quiet
even
breaths
i
wondered
drowsily
how
jay
would
have
felt
about
this
situation
he
who
hated
darkover
and
avoided
contact
with
every
other
human
being
crowded
between
a
darkovan
and
half
a
dozen
assorted
roughnecks
i
turned
the
thought
off
fearing
it
might
somehow
him
in
his
brain
but
i
had
to
think
of
something
anything
to
turn
aside
this
consciousness
of
the
woman
head
against
my
chest
her
warm
breath
coming
and
going
against
my
bare
neck
only
by
the
severest
possible
act
of
will
did
i
keep
myself
from
slipping
my
hand
over
her
breasts
warm
and
palpable
through
the
thin
sweater
i
wondered
why
forth
had
called
me
undisciplined
i
could
risk
my
leadership
by
making
advances
to
our
contracted
guide
woman
amazon
or
whatever
somehow
the
girl
seemed
to
be
the
pivot
point
of
all
my
thoughts
she
was
not
part
of
the
terran
hq
she
was
not
part
of
any
world
jay
allison
might
have
known
she
belonged
wholly
to
jason
to
my
world
between
sleep
and
waking
i
lost
myself
in
a
dream
of
skimming
along
the
tree
roads
chasing
the
distant
form
of
a
girl
driven
from
the
nest
that
day
with
blows
and
curses
somewhere
in
the
leaves
i
would
find
her
and
we
would
return
to
the
city
her
head
garlanded
with
the
red
leaves
of
a
and
the
same
women
who
had
stoned
her
forth
would
crowd
about
and
welcome
her
when
she
returned
the
fleeing
woman
looked
over
her
shoulder
with
kyla
eyes
and
then
the
woman
form
muted
and
dr
forth
was
standing
between
us
in
the
with
the
caduceus
emblem
on
his
coat
stretched
like
a
red
staff
between
us
kendricks
in
his
spaceforce
uniform
was
threatening
us
with
a
blaster
and
regis
hastur
was
suddenly
wearing
space
service
uniform
too
and
saying
jay
allison
jay
allison
as
the
splintered
and
cracked
beneath
our
feet
and
we
were
tumbling
down
the
waterfall
and
down
and
down
and
down
wake
up
kyla
whispered
and
dug
an
elbow
into
my
side
i
opened
my
eyes
on
crowded
blackness
grasping
at
the
vanishing
nightmare
the
matter
you
were
moaning
touch
of
altitude
sickness
i
grunted
realized
my
arm
was
around
her
shoulder
and
pulled
it
quickly
away
after
awhile
i
slept
again
fitfully
before
light
we
crawled
wearily
out
of
the
bivouac
cramped
and
stiff
and
not
rested
but
ready
to
get
out
of
this
and
go
on
the
snow
was
hard
in
the
dim
light
and
the
trail
not
difficult
here
after
all
the
trouble
on
the
lower
slopes
i
think
even
the
amateurs
had
lost
their
desire
for
adventurous
climbing
we
were
all
just
as
well
pleased
that
the
actual
crossing
of
dammerung
should
be
an
anticlimax
and
uneventful
the
sun
was
just
rising
when
we
reached
the
pass
and
we
stood
for
a
moment
gathered
close
together
in
the
narrow
defile
between
the
great
summits
to
either
side
hjalmar
gave
the
peaks
a
wistful
look
wish
we
could
climb
them
regis
grinned
at
him
companionably
sometime
and
you
have
the
word
of
a
hastur
you
be
along
on
that
expedition
the
big
fellows
eyes
glowed
regis
turned
to
me
and
said
warmly
what
about
it
jason
a
bargain
shall
we
all
climb
it
together
next
year
i
started
to
grin
back
and
then
some
bleak
black
devil
surged
up
in
me
raging
when
this
was
over
i
suddenly
realized
i
would
be
there
i
would
be
anywhere
i
was
a
surrogate
a
substitute
a
splinter
of
jay
allison
and
when
it
was
over
forth
and
his
tactics
would
put
me
back
into
what
they
considered
my
rightful
place
which
was
nowhere
never
climb
a
mountain
except
now
when
we
were
racing
against
time
and
necessity
i
set
my
mouth
in
an
unaccustomed
narrow
line
and
said
we
talk
about
that
when
we
get
back
if
we
ever
do
now
i
suggest
we
get
going
some
of
us
would
like
to
get
down
to
lower
altitudes
the
trail
down
from
dammerung
inside
the
ridge
unlike
the
outside
trail
was
clear
and
and
we
wound
down
the
slope
walking
in
easy
single
file
as
the
mist
thinned
and
we
left
the
behind
we
saw
what
looked
like
a
great
green
carpet
interspersed
with
shining
colors
which
were
mere
flickers
below
us
i
pointed
them
out
the
treetops
of
the
north
forest
and
the
colors
you
see
are
in
the
streets
of
the
trailcity
an
hour
walking
brought
us
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
we
travelled
swiftly
now
forgetting
our
weariness
eager
to
reach
the
city
before
nightfall
it
was
quiet
in
the
forest
almost
ominously
still
over
our
head
somewhere
in
the
thick
branches
which
in
places
shut
out
the
sunlight
completely
i
knew
that
the
ran
crisscross
and
now
and
again
i
heard
some
rustle
a
fragment
of
sound
a
voice
a
snatch
of
song
it
so
dark
down
here
rafe
muttered
anyone
living
in
this
forest
would
to
live
in
the
treetops
or
go
totally
blind
kendricks
whispered
to
me
are
we
being
followed
are
they
going
to
jump
us
i
do
think
so
what
you
hear
are
just
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
going
about
their
daily
business
up
there
queer
business
it
must
be
regis
said
curiously
and
as
we
walked
along
the
mossy
needly
forest
floor
i
told
him
something
of
the
trailmen
lives
i
had
lost
my
fear
if
anyone
came
at
us
now
i
could
speak
their
language
i
could
identify
myself
tell
my
business
name
my
some
of
my
confidence
evidently
spread
to
the
others
but
as
we
came
into
more
and
more
familiar
territory
i
stopped
abruptly
and
struck
my
hand
against
my
forehead
i
knew
we
had
forgotten
something
i
said
roughly
i
been
away
from
here
too
long
that
all
kyla
what
about
kyla
the
girl
explained
it
herself
in
her
expressionless
monotone
i
am
an
unattached
female
such
women
are
not
permitted
in
the
nests
that
easy
then
lerrys
said
she
must
belong
to
one
of
us
he
did
add
a
syllable
no
one
could
have
expected
it
darkovan
aristocrats
do
bring
their
women
on
trips
like
this
and
their
women
are
not
like
kyla
the
three
brothers
broke
into
a
spate
of
volunteering
and
rafe
made
an
obscene
suggestion
kyla
scowled
obstinately
her
mouth
tight
with
what
could
have
been
embarrassment
or
rage
if
you
believe
i
need
your
protection
kyla
i
said
tersely
is
under
protection
she
will
be
introduced
as
my
woman
and
treated
as
such
rafe
twisted
his
mouth
in
an
smile
i
see
the
leader
keeps
all
the
best
for
himself
my
face
must
have
done
something
i
did
know
about
for
rafe
backed
slowly
away
i
forced
myself
to
speak
slowly
kyla
is
a
guide
and
indispensable
if
anything
happens
to
me
she
is
the
only
one
who
can
lead
you
back
therefore
her
safety
is
my
personal
affair
understand
as
we
went
along
the
trail
the
vague
green
light
disappeared
right
below
the
trailcity
i
whispered
and
pointed
upward
all
around
us
the
hundred
trees
rose
branchless
pillars
so
immense
that
four
men
hands
joined
could
not
have
encircled
one
with
their
arms
they
stretched
upward
for
some
three
hundred
feet
before
stretching
out
their
interweaving
branches
above
that
nothing
was
visible
but
blackness
yet
the
grove
was
not
dark
but
lighted
with
the
startlingly
brilliant
phosphorescence
of
the
fungi
growing
on
the
trunks
and
trimmed
into
bizarre
ornamental
shapes
in
cages
of
transparent
fibre
glowing
insects
as
large
as
a
hand
hummed
softly
and
continuously
as
i
watched
a
trailman
quite
naked
except
for
an
ornate
hat
and
a
narrow
binding
around
the
loins
descended
the
trunk
he
went
from
cage
to
cage
feeding
the
with
bits
of
shining
fungus
from
a
basket
on
his
arm
i
called
to
him
in
his
own
language
and
he
dropped
the
basket
with
an
exclamation
his
spidery
thin
body
braced
to
flee
or
to
raise
an
alarm
but
i
belong
to
the
nest
i
called
to
him
and
gave
him
the
names
of
my
he
came
toward
me
gripping
my
forearm
with
warm
long
fingers
in
a
gesture
of
greeting
jason
yes
i
hear
them
speak
of
you
he
said
in
his
gentle
twittering
voice
you
are
at
home
but
those
others
he
gestured
nervously
at
the
strange
faces
my
friends
i
assured
him
and
we
come
to
beg
the
old
one
for
an
audience
for
tonight
i
seek
shelter
with
my
parents
if
they
will
receive
us
he
raised
his
head
and
called
softly
and
a
slim
child
bounded
down
the
trunk
and
took
the
basket
the
trailman
said
i
am
carrho
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
guided
you
to
your
so
you
will
not
be
challenged
i
breathed
more
freely
i
did
not
personally
recognize
carrho
but
he
looked
pleasantly
familiar
guided
by
him
we
climbed
one
by
one
up
the
dark
stairway
inside
the
trunk
and
emerged
into
the
bright
square
shaded
by
the
topmost
leaves
into
a
delicate
green
twilight
i
felt
weary
and
successful
kendricks
stepped
gingerly
on
the
swaying
jiggling
floor
of
the
square
it
gave
slightly
at
every
step
and
kendricks
swore
morosely
in
a
language
that
fortunately
only
rafe
and
i
understood
curious
trailmen
flocked
to
the
street
and
twittered
welcome
and
surprise
rafe
and
kendricks
betrayed
considerable
contempt
when
i
greeted
my
affectionately
they
were
already
old
and
i
was
saddened
to
see
it
their
fur
graying
their
prehensile
toes
and
fingers
crooked
with
a
rheumatic
complaint
of
some
sort
their
reddish
eyes
bleared
and
rheumy
they
welcomed
me
and
made
arrangements
for
the
others
in
my
party
to
be
housed
in
an
abandoned
house
nearby
they
had
insisted
that
i
of
course
must
return
to
their
roof
and
kyla
of
course
had
to
stay
with
me
could
we
camp
on
the
ground
instead
kendricks
asked
eying
the
flimsy
shelter
with
distaste
it
would
offend
our
hosts
i
said
firmly
i
saw
nothing
wrong
with
it
roofed
with
woven
bark
carpeted
with
moss
which
was
planted
on
the
floor
the
place
was
abandoned
somewhat
a
bit
musty
but
weathertight
and
seemed
comfortable
to
me
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
the
old
one
begging
the
favor
of
an
audience
with
him
that
done
by
one
of
my
we
settled
down
to
a
meal
of
buds
honey
insects
and
birds
eggs
it
tasted
good
to
me
with
the
familiarity
of
food
eaten
in
childhood
but
among
the
others
only
kyla
ate
with
appetite
and
regis
hastur
with
interested
curiosity
after
the
demands
of
hospitality
had
been
satisfied
my
asked
the
names
of
my
party
and
i
introduced
them
one
by
one
when
i
named
regis
hastur
it
reduced
them
to
brief
silence
and
then
to
an
outcry
gently
but
firmly
they
insisted
that
their
home
was
unworthy
to
shelter
the
son
of
a
hastur
and
that
he
must
be
fittingly
entertained
at
the
royal
nest
of
the
old
one
there
was
no
gracious
way
for
regis
to
protest
and
when
the
messenger
returned
he
prepared
to
accompany
him
but
before
leaving
he
drew
me
aside
i
do
much
like
leaving
the
rest
of
you
you
be
safe
enough
it
not
that
i
worried
about
dr
allison
call
me
jason
i
corrected
angrily
regis
said
with
a
little
tightening
of
his
mouth
that
it
you
have
to
be
allison
tomorrow
when
you
tell
the
old
one
about
your
mission
but
you
have
to
be
the
jason
he
knows
too
so
i
wish
i
need
leave
here
i
wish
you
were
going
to
stay
with
the
men
who
know
you
only
as
jason
instead
of
being
alone
or
only
with
kyla
there
was
something
odd
in
his
face
and
i
wondered
at
it
could
he
a
hastur
be
jealous
of
kyla
jealous
of
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
be
somehow
attracted
to
kyla
i
tried
to
pass
it
off
lightly
kyla
might
divert
me
regis
said
without
emphasis
yet
she
brought
allison
back
once
before
then
surprisingly
he
laughed
or
maybe
you
right
maybe
kyla
will
scare
away
allison
if
he
shows
up
the
coals
of
the
dying
fire
laid
strange
tints
of
color
on
kyla
face
and
shoulders
and
the
wispy
waves
of
her
dark
hair
now
that
we
were
alone
i
felt
constrained
ca
you
sleep
jason
i
shook
my
head
better
sleep
while
you
can
i
felt
that
this
night
of
all
nights
i
dared
not
close
my
eyes
or
when
i
woke
i
would
have
vanished
into
the
jay
allison
i
hated
for
a
moment
i
saw
the
room
with
his
eyes
to
him
it
would
not
seem
cosy
and
clean
but
habituated
to
white
sterile
tile
terran
rooms
and
corridors
dirty
and
unsanitary
as
any
beast
den
kyla
said
broodingly
you
a
strange
man
jason
what
sort
of
man
are
you
in
terra
world
i
laughed
but
there
was
no
mirth
in
it
suddenly
i
had
to
tell
her
the
whole
truth
kyla
the
man
you
know
as
me
does
exist
i
was
created
for
this
one
specific
task
once
it
finished
so
am
i
she
started
her
eyes
widening
i
heard
tales
of
of
the
terrans
and
their
sciences
that
they
make
men
who
are
real
men
of
metal
not
bone
and
flesh
before
the
dawning
of
that
naive
horror
i
quickly
held
out
my
bandaged
hand
took
her
fingers
in
mine
and
ran
them
over
it
is
this
metal
no
no
kyla
but
the
man
you
know
as
jason
i
wo
be
him
i
be
someone
different
how
could
i
explain
a
subsidiary
personality
to
kyla
when
i
did
understand
it
myself
she
kept
my
fingers
in
hers
softly
and
said
i
saw
someone
else
looking
from
your
eyes
at
me
once
a
ghost
i
shook
my
head
savagely
to
the
terrans
i
the
ghost
poor
ghost
she
whispered
her
pity
stung
i
did
want
it
what
i
do
remember
i
ca
regret
probably
i
wo
even
remember
you
but
i
lied
i
knew
that
although
i
forgot
everything
else
unregretting
because
unremembered
i
could
not
bear
to
lose
this
girl
that
my
ghost
would
walk
restless
forever
if
i
forgot
her
i
looked
across
the
fire
at
kyla
in
the
faint
light
only
a
few
coals
in
the
brazier
she
had
removed
her
sexless
outer
clothing
and
wore
some
clinging
garment
as
simple
as
a
child
smock
and
curiously
appealing
there
was
still
a
little
ridge
of
bandage
visible
beneath
it
and
a
random
memory
not
mine
remarked
in
the
back
corners
of
my
brain
that
with
the
cut
improperly
sutured
there
would
be
a
visible
scar
to
whom
she
reached
out
an
appealing
hand
jason
jason
my
deserted
me
i
felt
as
if
i
stood
small
and
reeling
under
a
great
empty
echoing
chamber
which
was
jay
allison
mind
and
that
the
roof
was
about
to
fall
in
on
me
kyla
image
flickered
in
and
out
of
focus
first
infinitely
gentle
and
appealing
then
as
if
seen
at
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
far
away
and
sharply
incised
and
as
remote
and
undesirable
as
any
bug
underneath
a
lens
her
hands
closed
on
my
shoulders
i
put
out
a
groping
hand
to
push
her
away
jason
she
implored
do
go
away
from
me
like
that
talk
to
me
tell
me
but
her
words
reached
me
through
emptiness
i
knew
important
things
might
hang
on
tomorrow
meeting
jason
alone
could
come
through
that
meeting
where
the
terrans
for
some
reason
put
him
through
this
hell
and
damnation
and
torture
oh
yes
the
trailmen
fever
jay
allison
pushed
the
girl
hand
away
and
scowled
savagely
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
concentrate
them
on
what
he
must
say
and
do
to
convince
the
trailmen
of
their
duty
toward
the
rest
of
the
planet
as
if
they
not
even
human
could
have
a
sense
of
duty
with
an
unaccustomed
surge
of
emotion
he
wished
he
were
with
the
others
kendricks
now
jay
knew
precisely
why
forth
had
sent
the
big
reliable
spaceman
at
his
back
and
that
handsome
arrogant
darkovan
where
was
he
jay
looked
at
the
girl
in
puzzlement
he
want
to
reveal
that
he
was
quite
sure
of
what
he
was
saying
or
doing
or
that
he
had
little
memory
of
what
jason
had
been
up
to
he
started
to
ask
where
did
the
hastur
kid
go
before
a
vagrant
logical
thought
told
him
that
such
an
important
guest
would
have
been
lodged
with
the
old
one
then
a
wave
of
despair
hit
him
jay
realized
he
did
not
even
speak
the
trailmen
language
that
it
had
slipped
from
his
thoughts
completely
illustration
she
felt
a
touch
of
panic
he
was
leaving
her
again
you
he
fished
desperately
for
the
girl
name
kyla
you
speak
the
trailmen
language
do
you
a
few
words
no
more
why
she
had
withdrawn
into
a
corner
of
the
tiny
room
still
not
far
from
him
and
he
wondered
remotely
what
his
damned
alter
ego
had
been
up
to
with
jason
there
was
no
telling
jay
raised
his
eyes
with
a
melancholy
smile
sit
down
child
you
need
be
frightened
i
i
trying
to
understand
the
girl
touched
him
again
evidently
trying
to
conquer
her
terror
it
is
easy
when
you
turn
into
someone
else
under
my
eyes
jay
saw
that
she
was
shaking
in
real
fright
he
said
wearily
i
not
going
to
to
turn
into
a
bat
and
fly
away
just
a
poor
devil
of
a
doctor
who
gotten
himself
into
one
unholy
mess
there
was
no
reason
he
was
thinking
to
take
out
his
own
misery
and
despair
by
shouting
at
this
poor
kid
god
knew
what
she
been
through
with
his
irresponsible
other
self
forth
had
admitted
that
that
damned
jason
personality
was
a
blend
of
all
the
undesirable
traits
he
fought
to
smother
all
his
life
by
an
effort
of
will
he
kept
himself
from
pulling
away
from
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
jason
do
slip
away
like
that
try
to
keep
hold
on
jay
propped
his
head
in
his
hands
trying
to
make
sense
of
that
certainly
in
the
dim
light
she
could
not
be
too
conscious
of
subtle
changes
of
expression
she
evidently
thought
she
was
talking
to
jason
she
did
seem
to
be
overly
intelligent
think
about
tomorrow
jason
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
him
think
about
your
parents
jay
allison
wondered
what
they
would
think
when
they
found
a
stranger
here
he
felt
like
a
stranger
yet
he
must
have
come
tonight
into
this
house
and
spoken
he
rummaged
desperately
in
his
mind
for
some
fragments
of
the
trailmen
language
he
had
spoken
it
as
a
child
he
must
recall
enough
to
speak
to
the
woman
who
had
been
a
kind
to
her
alien
son
he
tried
to
form
his
lips
to
the
unfamiliar
shapes
of
words
jay
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
again
jason
was
the
part
of
himself
that
remembered
the
trailmen
was
what
he
had
to
remember
jason
was
not
a
hostile
stranger
not
an
alien
intruder
in
his
body
jason
was
a
lost
part
of
himself
and
at
the
moment
a
damn
necessary
part
if
there
were
only
some
way
to
get
back
the
jason
memories
skills
without
losing
he
said
to
the
girl
let
me
think
let
me
to
his
surprise
and
horror
his
voice
broke
into
an
alien
tongue
let
me
alone
will
you
maybe
jay
thought
i
could
stay
myself
if
i
could
remember
the
rest
dr
forth
said
jason
would
remember
the
trailmen
with
kindness
not
dislike
jay
searched
his
memory
and
found
nothing
but
familiar
frustration
years
spent
in
an
alien
land
apart
from
a
human
heritage
stranded
and
abandoned
father
left
me
he
crashed
the
plane
and
i
never
saw
him
again
and
i
hate
him
for
leaving
me
but
his
father
had
not
abandoned
him
he
had
crashed
the
plane
trying
to
save
them
both
it
was
no
one
fault
my
father
for
trying
to
fly
over
the
hellers
into
a
country
where
no
man
belongs
he
had
belonged
and
yet
the
trailmen
whom
he
considered
little
better
than
roaming
beasts
had
taken
the
alien
child
into
their
city
their
homes
their
hearts
they
had
loved
him
and
he
and
i
loved
them
i
found
myself
saying
half
aloud
then
realized
that
kyla
was
gripping
my
arm
looking
up
imploringly
into
my
face
i
shook
my
head
rather
groggily
what
the
matter
you
frightened
me
she
said
in
a
shaky
little
voice
and
i
suddenly
knew
what
had
happened
i
tensed
with
savage
rage
against
jay
allison
he
could
even
give
me
the
splinter
of
life
i
won
for
myself
but
had
to
come
sneaking
out
of
my
mind
how
he
must
hate
me
not
half
as
much
as
i
hated
him
damn
him
along
with
everything
else
he
scared
kyla
half
to
death
she
was
kneeling
very
close
to
me
and
i
realized
that
there
was
one
way
to
fight
that
cold
austere
fish
of
a
jay
allison
send
him
shrieking
down
into
hell
again
he
was
a
man
who
hated
everything
except
the
cold
world
he
made
his
life
kyla
face
was
lifted
soft
and
intent
and
pleading
and
suddenly
i
reached
out
and
pulled
her
to
me
and
kissed
her
hard
could
a
ghost
do
this
i
demanded
or
this
she
whispered
no
oh
no
and
her
arms
went
up
to
lock
around
my
neck
as
i
pulled
her
down
on
the
moss
that
carpeted
the
chamber
i
felt
the
dark
ghost
of
my
other
self
thin
out
vanish
and
disappear
regis
had
been
right
it
had
been
the
only
way
the
old
one
was
not
old
at
all
the
title
was
purely
ceremonial
this
one
was
young
not
much
older
than
i
but
he
had
poise
and
dignity
and
the
same
strange
indefinable
quality
i
had
recognized
in
regis
hastur
it
was
something
i
supposed
that
the
terran
empire
had
lost
in
spreading
from
star
to
star
a
feeling
of
knowing
one
own
place
a
dignity
that
did
demand
recognition
because
it
had
never
lacked
for
it
like
all
trailmen
he
had
the
chinless
face
and
lobeless
ears
the
body
which
looked
slightly
less
than
human
he
spoke
very
low
the
trailmen
have
very
acute
hearing
and
i
had
to
strain
my
ears
to
listen
and
remember
to
keep
my
own
voice
down
he
stretched
his
hand
to
me
and
i
lowered
my
head
over
it
and
murmured
i
take
submission
old
one
never
mind
that
he
said
in
his
gentle
twittering
voice
sit
down
my
son
you
are
welcome
here
but
i
feel
you
have
abused
our
trust
in
you
we
dismissed
you
to
your
own
kind
because
we
felt
you
would
be
happier
so
did
we
show
you
anything
but
kindness
that
after
so
many
years
you
return
with
armed
men
the
reproof
in
his
red
eyes
was
hardly
an
auspicious
beginning
i
said
helplessly
old
one
the
men
with
me
are
not
armed
a
band
of
attacked
us
and
we
defended
ourselves
i
travelled
with
so
many
men
only
because
i
feared
to
travel
the
passes
alone
but
does
that
explain
why
you
have
returned
at
all
the
reason
and
reproach
in
his
voice
made
sense
finally
i
said
old
one
we
come
as
suppliants
my
people
appeal
to
your
people
in
the
hope
that
you
will
be
i
started
to
say
stopped
and
amended
that
you
will
deal
as
kindly
with
them
as
with
me
his
face
betrayed
nothing
what
do
you
ask
i
explained
i
told
it
badly
stumbling
not
knowing
the
technical
terms
knowing
they
had
no
equivalents
anyway
in
the
language
he
listened
asking
a
penetrating
question
now
and
again
when
i
mentioned
the
terran
legate
offer
to
recognize
the
trailmen
as
a
separate
and
independent
government
he
frowned
and
rebuked
me
we
of
the
sky
people
have
no
dealings
with
the
terrans
and
care
nothing
for
their
recognition
or
its
lack
for
that
i
had
no
answer
and
the
old
one
continued
kindly
but
indifferently
we
do
not
like
to
think
that
the
fever
which
is
a
children
little
sickness
with
us
shall
kill
so
many
of
your
kind
but
you
can
not
in
all
honesty
blame
us
you
can
not
say
that
we
spread
the
disease
we
never
go
beyond
the
mountains
are
we
to
blame
that
the
winds
change
or
the
moons
come
together
in
the
sky
when
the
time
has
come
for
men
to
die
they
die
he
stretched
his
hand
in
dismissal
i
will
give
your
men
to
the
river
jason
do
not
return
regis
hastur
rose
suddenly
and
faced
him
will
you
hear
me
father
he
used
the
ceremonial
title
without
hesitation
and
the
old
one
said
in
distress
the
son
of
hastur
need
never
speak
as
a
suppliant
to
the
sky
people
nevertheless
hear
me
as
a
suppliant
father
regis
said
quietly
it
is
not
the
strangers
and
aliens
of
terra
who
are
pleading
we
have
learned
one
thing
from
the
strangers
of
terra
which
you
have
not
yet
learned
i
am
young
and
it
is
not
fitting
that
i
should
teach
you
but
you
have
said
are
we
to
blame
that
the
moons
come
together
in
the
sky
no
but
we
have
learned
from
the
terrans
not
to
blame
the
moons
in
the
sky
for
our
own
ignorance
of
the
ways
of
the
gods
by
which
i
mean
the
ways
of
sickness
or
poverty
or
misery
these
are
strange
words
for
a
hastur
said
the
old
one
displeased
these
are
strange
times
for
a
hastur
said
regis
loudly
the
old
one
winced
and
regis
moderated
his
tone
but
continued
vehemently
you
blame
the
moons
in
the
sky
say
the
moons
are
not
to
blame
nor
the
winds
nor
the
gods
the
gods
send
these
things
to
men
to
test
their
wits
and
to
find
if
they
have
the
will
to
master
them
the
old
one
forehead
ridged
vertically
and
he
said
with
stinging
contempt
is
this
the
breed
of
king
which
men
call
hastur
now
man
or
god
or
hastur
i
am
not
too
proud
to
plead
for
my
people
retorted
regis
flushing
with
anger
never
in
all
the
history
of
darkover
has
a
hastur
stood
before
one
of
you
and
begged
for
the
men
from
another
world
for
all
men
on
our
world
old
one
i
could
sit
and
keep
state
in
the
house
of
the
hasturs
and
even
death
could
not
touch
me
until
i
grew
weary
of
living
but
i
preferred
to
learn
new
lives
from
new
men
the
terrans
have
something
to
teach
even
the
hasturs
and
they
can
learn
a
remedy
against
the
trailmen
fever
he
looked
round
at
me
turning
the
discussion
over
to
me
again
and
i
said
i
am
no
alien
from
another
world
old
one
i
have
been
a
son
in
your
house
perhaps
i
was
sent
to
teach
you
to
fight
destiny
i
can
not
believe
you
are
indifferent
to
death
suddenly
hardly
knowing
what
i
was
going
to
do
until
i
found
myself
on
my
knees
i
knelt
and
looked
up
into
the
quiet
stern
remote
face
of
the
nonhuman
my
father
i
said
you
took
a
dying
man
and
a
dying
child
from
a
burning
plane
even
those
of
their
own
kind
might
have
stripped
their
corpses
and
left
them
to
die
you
saved
the
child
fostered
him
and
treated
him
as
a
son
when
he
reached
an
age
to
be
unhappy
with
you
you
let
a
dozen
of
your
people
risk
their
lives
to
take
him
to
his
own
you
can
not
ask
me
to
believe
that
you
are
indifferent
to
the
death
of
a
million
of
my
people
when
the
fate
of
one
could
stir
your
pity
there
was
a
moment
silence
finally
the
old
one
said
indifferent
no
but
helpless
my
people
die
when
they
leave
the
mountains
the
air
is
too
rich
for
them
the
food
is
wrong
the
light
blinds
and
tortures
them
can
i
send
them
to
suffer
and
die
those
people
who
call
me
father
and
a
memory
buried
all
my
life
suddenly
surfaced
i
said
urgently
father
listen
in
the
world
i
live
in
now
i
am
called
a
wise
man
you
need
not
believe
me
but
listen
i
know
your
people
they
are
my
people
i
remember
when
i
left
you
more
than
a
dozen
of
my
friends
offered
knowing
they
risked
death
to
go
with
me
i
was
a
child
i
did
not
realize
the
sacrifice
they
made
but
i
watched
them
suffer
as
we
went
lower
in
the
mountains
and
i
resolved
i
resolved
i
spoke
with
difficulty
forcing
the
words
through
a
reluctant
barricade
that
since
others
had
suffered
so
for
me
i
would
spend
my
life
in
curing
the
sufferings
of
others
father
the
terrans
call
me
a
wise
doctor
a
man
of
healing
among
the
terrans
i
can
see
that
my
people
if
they
will
come
to
us
and
help
us
have
air
they
can
breathe
and
food
which
will
suit
them
and
that
they
are
guarded
from
the
light
i
do
ask
you
to
send
anyone
father
i
ask
only
tell
your
sons
what
i
have
told
you
if
i
know
your
people
who
are
my
people
forever
hundreds
of
them
will
offer
to
return
with
me
and
you
may
witness
what
your
has
sworn
here
if
one
of
your
sons
dies
your
alien
son
will
answer
for
it
with
his
own
life
the
words
had
poured
from
me
in
a
flood
they
were
not
all
mine
some
unconscious
thing
had
recalled
in
me
that
jay
allison
had
power
to
make
these
promises
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
see
what
force
what
guilt
what
dedication
working
in
jay
allison
had
turned
him
aside
from
me
i
remained
at
the
old
one
feet
kneeling
overcome
ashamed
of
the
thing
i
had
become
jay
allison
was
worth
ten
of
me
irresponsible
forth
had
said
lacking
purpose
lacking
balance
what
right
had
i
to
despise
my
soberer
self
at
last
i
felt
the
old
one
touch
my
head
lightly
get
up
my
son
he
said
i
will
answer
for
my
people
and
forgive
me
for
my
doubts
and
my
delays
neither
regis
nor
i
spoke
for
a
minute
after
we
left
the
audience
room
then
almost
as
one
we
turned
to
each
other
regis
spoke
first
soberly
it
was
a
fine
thing
you
did
jason
i
did
believe
he
agree
to
it
it
was
your
speech
that
did
it
i
denied
the
sober
mood
the
unaccustomed
surge
of
emotion
was
still
on
me
but
it
was
giving
way
to
a
sudden
upswing
of
exaltation
damn
it
i
it
let
jay
allison
try
to
match
regis
still
looked
grave
he
have
refused
but
you
appealed
to
him
as
one
of
themselves
and
yet
it
was
quite
that
it
was
something
more
regis
put
a
quick
embarrassed
arm
around
my
shoulders
and
suddenly
blurted
out
i
think
the
terran
medical
played
hell
with
your
life
jason
and
even
if
it
saves
a
million
lives
it
hard
to
forgive
them
for
that
late
the
next
day
the
old
one
called
us
in
again
and
told
us
that
a
hundred
men
had
volunteered
to
return
with
us
and
act
as
blood
donors
and
experimental
subjects
for
research
into
the
trailmen
disease
the
trip
over
the
mountains
so
painfully
accomplished
was
easier
in
return
our
escort
of
a
hundred
trailmen
guaranteed
us
against
attack
and
they
could
choose
the
easiest
paths
only
as
we
undertook
the
long
climb
downward
through
the
foothills
did
the
trailmen
to
ground
travel
at
any
time
and
suffering
from
the
unaccustomed
low
altitude
begin
to
weaken
as
we
grew
stronger
more
and
more
of
them
faltered
and
we
travelled
more
and
more
slowly
not
even
kendricks
could
be
callous
about
inhuman
animals
by
the
time
we
reached
the
point
where
we
had
left
the
pack
animals
and
it
was
rafe
scott
who
came
to
me
and
said
desperately
jason
these
poor
fellows
will
never
make
it
to
carthon
lerrys
and
i
know
this
country
let
us
go
ahead
as
fast
as
we
can
travel
alone
and
arrange
at
carthon
for
transit
maybe
we
can
get
pressurized
aircraft
to
fly
them
from
here
we
can
send
a
message
from
carthon
too
about
accommodations
for
them
at
the
terran
hq
i
was
surprised
and
a
little
guilty
that
i
had
not
thought
of
this
myself
i
covered
it
with
a
mocking
i
thought
you
did
give
a
damn
about
of
my
friends
rafe
said
doggedly
i
guess
i
was
wrong
about
that
they
going
through
this
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
so
they
must
be
pretty
different
than
i
thought
they
were
regis
who
had
overheard
rafe
plan
now
broke
in
quietly
there
no
need
for
you
to
travel
ahead
rafe
i
can
send
a
quicker
message
i
had
forgotten
that
regis
was
a
trained
telepath
he
added
there
are
some
space
and
distance
limitations
to
such
messages
but
there
is
a
regular
relay
net
all
over
darkover
and
one
of
the
relays
is
a
girl
who
lives
at
the
very
edge
of
the
terran
zone
you
tell
me
what
will
give
her
access
to
the
terran
hq
he
flushed
slightly
and
explained
from
what
i
know
of
the
terrans
she
would
not
be
very
fortunate
relaying
the
message
if
she
merely
walked
to
the
gate
and
said
she
had
a
relayed
telepathic
message
for
someone
would
she
i
had
to
smile
at
the
picture
that
conjured
up
in
my
mind
i
afraid
not
i
admitted
tell
her
to
go
to
dr
forth
and
give
the
message
from
jason
allison
regis
looked
at
me
curiously
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
spoken
my
own
name
in
the
hearing
of
the
others
but
he
nodded
without
comment
for
the
next
hour
or
two
he
seemed
somewhat
more
than
usual
but
after
a
time
he
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
the
message
had
gone
through
sometime
later
he
relayed
an
answer
that
airlift
would
be
waiting
for
us
not
at
carthon
but
a
small
village
near
the
ford
of
the
kadarin
where
we
had
left
our
trucks
when
we
camped
that
night
there
were
a
dozen
practical
problems
needing
attention
the
time
and
exact
place
of
crossing
the
ford
the
reassurance
to
be
given
to
terrified
trailmen
who
could
face
leaving
their
forests
but
not
crossing
the
final
barricade
of
the
river
the
small
help
in
our
power
to
be
given
the
sick
ones
but
after
everything
had
been
done
that
i
could
do
and
after
the
whole
camp
had
quieted
down
i
sat
before
the
fire
and
stared
into
it
deep
in
painful
lassitude
tomorrow
we
would
cross
the
river
and
a
few
hours
later
we
would
be
back
in
the
terran
hq
and
then
and
then
and
then
nothing
i
would
vanish
i
would
utterly
cease
to
exist
anywhere
except
as
a
vagrant
ghost
troubling
jay
unquiet
dreams
as
he
moved
through
the
cold
round
of
his
days
i
would
be
no
more
than
a
spent
wind
a
burst
bubble
a
thinned
cloud
the
rose
and
saffron
of
the
dying
gave
shape
to
my
dreams
once
more
as
in
the
trailcity
that
night
kyla
slipped
through
firelight
to
my
side
and
i
looked
up
at
her
and
suddenly
i
knew
i
could
not
bear
it
i
pulled
her
to
me
and
muttered
oh
kyla
kyla
i
even
remember
you
she
pushed
my
hands
away
kneeling
upright
and
said
urgently
jason
listen
we
are
close
to
carthon
the
others
can
lead
them
the
rest
of
the
way
why
go
back
to
them
at
all
slip
away
now
and
never
go
back
we
can
she
stopped
coloring
fiercely
that
sudden
and
terrifying
shyness
overcoming
her
again
and
at
last
she
said
in
a
whisper
darkover
is
a
wide
world
jason
big
enough
for
us
to
hide
in
i
believe
they
would
search
very
far
they
would
i
could
leave
word
with
kendricks
not
with
regis
the
telepath
would
see
through
me
immediately
that
i
had
ridden
ahead
to
carthon
with
kyla
by
the
time
they
realized
that
i
had
fled
they
would
be
too
concerned
with
getting
the
trailmen
safely
to
the
terran
zone
to
spend
much
time
looking
for
a
runaway
as
kyla
said
the
world
was
wide
and
it
was
my
world
and
i
would
not
be
alone
in
it
kyla
kyla
i
said
helplessly
and
crushed
her
against
me
kissing
her
she
closed
her
eyes
and
i
took
a
long
long
look
at
her
face
not
beautiful
no
but
womanly
and
brave
and
all
the
other
beautiful
things
it
was
a
farewell
look
and
i
knew
it
if
she
did
after
the
briefest
time
she
pulled
a
little
away
and
her
flat
voice
was
gentler
and
more
breathless
than
usual
we
better
leave
before
the
others
waken
she
saw
that
i
did
not
move
jason
i
could
not
look
at
her
muffled
behind
my
hands
i
said
no
kyla
i
i
promised
the
old
one
to
look
after
my
people
in
the
terran
world
i
must
go
back
you
wo
be
to
look
after
them
you
wo
be
i
said
bleakly
i
write
a
letter
to
remind
myself
jay
allison
has
a
very
strong
sense
of
duty
he
look
after
them
for
me
he
wo
like
it
but
he
do
it
with
his
last
breath
he
a
better
man
than
i
am
kyla
you
better
forget
about
me
i
said
wearily
i
never
existed
that
was
the
end
not
nearly
she
begged
and
i
do
know
why
i
put
myself
through
the
hell
of
stubbornness
but
in
the
end
she
ran
away
crying
and
i
threw
myself
down
by
the
fire
cursing
forth
cursing
my
own
folly
but
most
of
all
cursing
jay
allison
hating
my
other
self
with
a
blistering
sickening
rage
coming
through
the
outskirts
of
the
small
village
the
next
afternoon
the
village
where
the
airlift
would
meet
us
we
noted
that
the
poorer
quarter
was
almost
abandoned
regis
said
bleakly
it
begun
and
dropped
out
of
line
to
stand
in
the
doorway
of
a
silent
dwelling
after
a
minute
he
beckoned
to
me
and
i
looked
inside
i
wished
i
had
the
sight
would
haunt
me
while
i
lived
an
old
man
two
young
women
and
half
a
dozen
children
between
four
and
fifteen
years
old
lay
inside
the
old
man
one
of
the
children
and
one
of
the
young
women
were
laid
out
neatly
in
clean
death
shrouded
their
faces
covered
with
green
branches
after
the
darkovan
custom
for
the
dead
the
other
young
woman
lay
huddled
near
the
fireplace
her
coarse
dress
splattered
with
the
filthy
stuff
she
had
vomited
dying
the
children
but
even
now
i
ca
think
of
the
children
without
retching
one
very
small
had
been
in
the
woman
arms
when
she
collapsed
it
had
squirmed
free
for
a
little
while
the
others
were
in
an
indescribable
condition
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
one
of
them
was
still
moving
feebly
long
past
help
regis
turned
blindly
from
the
door
and
leaned
against
the
wall
his
shoulders
heaving
not
as
i
first
thought
in
disgust
but
in
grief
tears
ran
over
his
hands
and
spilled
down
and
when
i
took
him
by
the
arm
to
lead
him
away
he
reeled
and
fell
against
me
he
said
in
a
broken
blurred
choking
voice
oh
lord
jason
those
children
those
children
if
you
ever
had
any
doubts
about
what
doing
any
doubts
about
what
you
done
think
about
that
think
that
you
saved
a
whole
world
from
that
think
that
you
done
something
even
the
hasturs
could
do
my
own
throat
tightened
with
something
more
than
embarrassment
better
wait
till
we
know
for
sure
whether
the
terrans
can
carry
through
with
it
and
you
better
get
to
hell
away
from
this
doorway
i
immune
but
damn
it
you
not
but
i
had
to
take
him
and
lead
him
away
like
a
child
from
that
house
he
looked
up
into
my
face
and
said
with
burning
sincerity
i
wonder
if
you
believe
i
give
my
life
a
dozen
times
over
to
have
done
that
it
was
a
curious
austere
reward
but
vaguely
it
comforted
me
and
then
as
we
rode
into
the
village
itself
i
lost
myself
or
tried
to
lose
myself
in
reassuring
the
frightened
trailmen
who
had
never
seen
a
city
on
the
ground
never
seen
or
heard
of
an
airplane
i
avoided
kyla
i
did
want
a
final
word
a
farewell
we
had
had
our
farewells
already
forth
had
done
a
marvelous
job
of
having
quarters
ready
for
the
trailmen
and
after
they
were
comfortably
installed
and
reassured
i
went
down
wearily
and
dressed
in
jay
allison
clothing
i
looked
out
the
window
at
the
distant
mountains
and
a
line
from
the
book
on
mountaineering
which
i
had
bought
as
a
youngster
in
an
alien
world
and
jay
had
kept
as
a
stray
fragment
of
personality
ran
in
violent
conflict
through
my
mind
hidden
go
and
find
lost
beyond
the
i
had
just
begun
to
live
surely
i
deserved
better
than
this
to
vanish
when
i
had
just
discovered
life
did
the
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
live
deserve
to
live
at
all
jay
allison
that
cold
man
who
had
never
looked
beyond
any
ranges
why
should
i
be
lost
in
him
something
lost
beyond
the
ranges
nothing
would
be
lost
but
myself
i
was
beginning
to
loathe
the
overflown
sense
of
duty
which
had
brought
me
back
here
now
when
it
was
too
late
i
was
bitterly
regretting
kyla
had
offered
me
life
surely
i
would
never
see
kyla
again
could
i
regret
what
i
would
never
remember
i
walked
into
forth
office
as
if
i
were
going
to
my
doom
i
forth
greeted
me
warmly
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
he
insisted
i
would
rather
not
speak
instead
compulsively
i
made
it
a
full
report
and
curious
flickers
came
in
and
out
of
my
consciousness
as
i
spoke
by
the
time
i
realized
i
was
reacting
to
a
suggestion
that
in
fact
i
was
going
under
hypnosis
again
it
was
too
late
and
i
could
only
think
that
this
was
worse
than
death
because
in
a
way
i
would
be
alive
jay
allison
sat
up
and
meticulously
straightened
his
cuff
before
tightening
his
mouth
in
what
was
meant
for
a
smile
i
assume
then
that
the
experiment
was
a
success
a
complete
success
forth
voice
was
somewhat
harsh
and
annoyed
but
jay
was
untroubled
he
had
known
for
years
that
most
of
his
subordinates
and
superiors
disliked
him
and
had
long
ago
stopped
worrying
about
it
the
trailmen
agreed
they
agreed
forth
said
surprised
you
do
remember
anything
at
all
scraps
like
a
nightmare
jay
allison
looked
down
at
the
back
of
his
hand
flexing
the
fingers
cautiously
against
pain
touching
the
partially
healed
red
slash
forth
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
and
said
not
unsympathetically
do
worry
about
your
hand
i
looked
at
it
pretty
carefully
you
have
the
total
use
of
it
jay
said
rigidly
it
seems
to
have
been
a
pretty
severe
risk
to
take
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
what
it
would
have
meant
to
me
to
lose
the
use
of
my
hand
it
seemed
a
justifiable
risk
even
if
you
had
forth
said
dryly
jay
i
got
the
whole
story
on
tape
just
as
you
told
it
to
me
you
might
not
like
having
a
blank
spot
in
your
memory
want
to
hear
what
your
alter
ego
did
jay
hesitated
then
he
unfolded
his
long
legs
and
stood
up
no
i
think
i
care
to
know
he
waited
arrested
by
a
twinge
of
a
sore
muscle
and
frowned
what
had
happened
what
would
he
never
know
why
did
the
random
ache
bring
a
pain
deeper
than
the
pain
of
a
torn
nerve
forth
was
watching
him
and
jay
asked
irritably
what
is
it
you
one
hell
of
a
cold
fish
jay
i
do
understand
you
sir
you
would
forth
muttered
funny
i
your
subsidiary
personality
jay
mouth
contracted
in
a
mirthless
grin
you
would
he
said
and
swung
quickly
round
come
on
if
i
going
to
work
on
that
serum
project
i
better
inspect
the
volunteers
and
line
up
the
blood
donors
and
look
over
old
whatshisname
papers
but
beyond
the
window
the
snowy
ridges
of
the
mountain
inscrutable
caught
and
held
his
eye
a
riddle
and
a
puzzle
ridiculous
he
said
and
went
to
his
work
four
months
later
jay
allison
and
randall
forth
stood
together
watching
the
last
of
the
disappearing
planes
carrying
the
volunteers
back
toward
carthon
and
their
mountains
i
should
have
flown
back
to
carthon
with
them
jay
said
moodily
forth
watched
the
tall
man
stare
at
the
mountain
wondered
what
lay
behind
the
contained
gestures
and
the
brooding
he
said
you
done
enough
jay
you
worked
like
the
devil
thurmond
the
legate
sent
down
to
say
you
get
an
official
commendation
and
a
promotion
for
your
part
that
not
even
mentioning
what
you
did
in
the
trailmen
city
he
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
jay
shook
it
off
impatiently
all
through
the
work
of
isolating
and
testing
the
blood
fraction
jay
had
worked
tirelessly
and
unsparingly
scarcely
sleeping
but
brooding
silent
prone
to
fly
into
sudden
savage
rages
but
painstaking
he
had
overseen
the
trailmen
with
an
almost
fatherly
solicitude
but
from
a
distance
he
had
left
no
stone
unturned
for
their
comfort
but
refused
to
see
them
in
person
except
when
it
was
unavoidable
forth
thought
we
played
a
dangerous
game
jay
allison
had
made
his
own
adjustment
to
life
and
we
disturbed
that
balance
have
we
wrecked
the
man
he
expendable
but
damn
it
what
a
loss
he
asked
well
why
you
fly
back
to
carthon
with
them
kendricks
went
along
you
know
he
expected
you
to
go
until
the
last
minute
jay
did
not
answer
he
had
avoided
kendricks
the
only
witness
to
his
duality
in
all
his
nightmare
brooding
the
avoidance
of
anyone
who
had
known
him
as
jason
became
a
mania
once
meeting
rafe
scott
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
hq
he
had
turned
frantically
and
plunged
like
a
madman
through
halls
and
corridors
to
avoid
coming
face
to
face
with
the
man
finally
running
up
four
flights
of
stairs
and
taking
shelter
in
his
rooms
with
the
pounding
heart
and
bursting
veins
of
a
hunted
criminal
at
last
he
said
if
you
called
me
down
here
to
read
me
the
riot
act
about
not
wanting
to
make
another
trip
into
the
hellers
no
no
forth
said
equably
there
a
visitor
coming
regis
hastur
sent
word
he
wants
to
see
you
in
case
you
do
remember
him
he
was
on
project
jason
i
remember
jay
said
grimly
it
was
nearly
his
one
clear
memory
the
nightmare
of
the
ledge
his
slashed
hand
the
shameful
naked
body
of
the
darkovan
woman
and
blurring
these
things
the
darkovan
aristocrat
who
had
banished
him
for
jason
again
he
a
better
psychiatrist
than
you
are
forth
he
changed
me
into
jason
in
the
flicker
of
an
eyelash
and
it
took
you
half
a
dozen
hypnotic
sessions
i
heard
about
the
psi
powers
of
the
hasturs
forth
said
but
never
been
lucky
enough
to
meet
one
in
person
tell
me
about
it
what
did
he
do
jay
made
a
tight
movement
of
exasperation
too
controlled
for
a
shrug
ask
him
why
do
you
look
forth
i
do
much
care
to
see
him
i
did
do
it
for
darkover
i
did
it
because
it
was
my
job
i
prefer
to
forget
the
whole
thing
why
do
you
talk
to
him
i
rather
had
the
idea
that
he
wanted
to
see
you
personally
jay
you
did
a
tremendous
thing
man
damn
it
why
do
you
strut
a
little
be
be
normal
for
once
why
i
be
damned
near
bursting
with
pride
if
one
of
the
hasturs
insisted
on
congratulating
me
personally
jay
lip
twitched
and
his
voice
shook
with
controlled
exasperation
maybe
you
would
i
do
see
it
that
way
well
i
afraid
you
have
to
on
darkover
nobody
refuses
when
the
hasturs
make
a
request
and
certainly
not
a
request
as
reasonable
as
this
one
forth
sat
down
beside
the
desk
jay
struck
the
woodwork
with
a
violent
clenched
fist
and
when
he
lowered
his
hand
there
was
a
tiny
smear
of
blood
along
his
knuckles
after
a
minute
he
walked
to
the
couch
and
sat
down
very
straight
and
stiff
saying
nothing
neither
of
the
men
spoke
again
until
forth
started
at
the
sound
of
a
buzzer
drew
the
mouthpiece
toward
him
and
said
tell
him
we
are
honored
you
know
the
routine
for
dignitaries
and
send
him
up
here
jay
twisted
his
fingers
together
and
ran
his
thumb
in
a
new
gesture
over
the
ridge
of
scar
tissue
along
the
knuckles
forth
was
aware
of
an
entirely
new
quality
in
the
silence
and
started
to
speak
to
break
it
but
before
he
could
do
so
the
office
door
slid
open
on
its
silent
beam
and
regis
hastur
stood
there
forth
rose
courteously
and
jay
got
to
his
feet
like
a
mechanical
doll
jerked
on
strings
the
young
darkovan
ruler
smiled
engagingly
at
him
do
bother
this
visit
is
informal
that
the
reason
i
came
here
rather
than
inviting
you
both
to
the
tower
dr
forth
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
again
sir
i
hope
that
our
gratitude
to
you
will
soon
take
a
more
tangible
form
there
has
not
been
a
single
death
from
the
trailmen
fever
since
you
made
the
serum
available
jay
motionless
saw
bitterly
that
the
old
man
had
succumbed
to
the
youngster
deliberate
charm
the
chubby
wrinkled
old
face
seamed
up
in
a
pleased
smile
as
forth
said
the
gifts
sent
to
the
trailmen
in
your
name
lord
hastur
were
greatly
welcomed
do
you
think
that
any
of
us
will
ever
forget
what
they
have
done
regis
replied
he
turned
toward
the
window
and
smiled
rather
tentatively
at
the
man
who
stood
there
motionless
since
his
first
conventional
gesture
of
politeness
allison
do
you
remember
me
at
all
i
remember
you
jay
allison
said
sullenly
his
voice
hung
heavy
in
the
room
its
sound
a
miasma
in
his
ears
all
his
sleepless
brooding
all
his
bottled
hate
for
darkover
and
the
memories
he
had
tried
to
bury
erupted
into
overwrought
bitterness
against
this
youngster
who
was
a
demigod
on
this
world
and
who
had
humiliated
him
repudiated
him
for
the
hated
jason
for
jay
regis
had
suddenly
become
the
symbol
of
a
world
that
hated
him
forced
him
into
a
false
mold
a
black
and
rushing
wind
seemed
to
blur
the
room
he
said
hoarsely
i
remember
you
all
right
and
took
one
savage
hurtling
step
the
weight
of
the
unexpected
blow
spun
regis
around
and
the
next
moment
jay
allison
who
had
never
touched
another
human
being
except
with
the
remote
hands
of
healing
closed
steely
murderous
hands
around
throat
the
world
thinned
out
into
a
crimson
rage
there
were
shouting
and
sudden
noises
and
a
explosion
in
his
brain
you
better
drink
this
forth
remarked
and
i
realized
i
was
turning
a
paper
cup
in
my
hands
forth
sat
down
a
little
weakly
as
i
raised
it
to
my
lips
and
sipped
regis
took
his
hand
away
from
his
throat
and
said
huskily
i
could
use
some
of
that
doctor
i
put
the
whiskey
down
you
do
better
with
water
until
your
throat
muscles
are
healed
i
said
swiftly
and
went
to
fill
a
throwaway
cup
for
him
without
thinking
handing
it
to
him
i
stopped
in
sudden
dismay
and
my
hand
shook
spilling
a
few
drops
i
said
hoarsely
swallowing
but
drink
it
anyway
regis
got
a
few
drops
down
painfully
and
said
my
own
fault
the
moment
i
saw
jay
allison
i
knew
he
was
a
madman
i
have
stopped
him
sooner
only
he
took
me
by
surprise
but
you
say
i
jay
allison
i
said
and
then
my
knees
went
weak
and
i
sat
down
what
in
hell
is
this
i
not
jay
but
i
not
jason
either
i
could
remember
my
entire
life
but
the
focus
had
shifted
i
still
felt
the
old
love
the
old
nostalgia
for
the
trailmen
but
i
also
knew
with
a
sure
sense
of
identity
that
i
was
doctor
jason
allison
who
had
abandoned
mountain
climbing
and
become
a
specialist
in
darkovan
parasitology
not
jay
who
had
rejected
his
world
not
jason
who
had
been
rejected
by
it
but
then
who
regis
said
quietly
i
seen
you
before
once
when
you
knelt
to
the
old
one
of
the
trailmen
with
a
whimsical
smile
he
said
as
an
ignorant
superstitious
darkovan
i
say
that
you
were
a
man
balanced
his
god
and
daemon
for
once
i
looked
helplessly
at
the
young
hastur
a
few
seconds
ago
my
hands
had
been
at
his
throat
jay
or
jason
maddened
by
and
jealousy
could
disclaim
responsibility
for
the
other
acts
i
could
regis
said
we
could
take
the
easy
way
out
and
arrange
it
so
never
have
to
see
each
other
again
or
we
could
do
it
the
hard
way
he
extended
his
hand
and
after
a
minute
i
understood
and
we
shook
hands
briefly
like
strangers
who
have
just
met
he
added
your
work
with
the
trailmen
is
finished
but
we
hasturs
committed
ourselves
to
teach
some
of
the
terrans
our
science
matrix
mechanics
allison
jason
you
know
darkover
and
i
think
we
could
work
with
you
further
you
know
something
about
slipping
mental
gears
i
meant
to
ask
would
you
care
to
be
one
of
them
you
be
ideal
i
looked
out
the
window
at
the
distant
mountains
this
work
this
would
be
something
which
would
satisfy
both
halves
of
myself
the
irresistible
force
the
immovable
object
and
no
ghosts
wandering
in
my
brain
do
it
i
told
regis
and
then
deliberately
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
went
up
to
the
quarters
now
deserted
which
we
had
readied
for
the
trailmen
with
my
new
doubled
or
complete
memories
another
ghost
had
roused
up
in
my
brain
and
i
remembered
a
woman
who
had
appeared
vaguely
in
jay
allison
orbit
unnoticed
working
with
the
trailmen
tolerated
because
she
could
speak
their
language
i
opened
the
door
searched
briefly
through
the
rooms
and
shouted
kyla
and
she
came
running
disheveled
mine
at
the
last
moment
she
drew
back
a
little
from
my
arms
and
whispered
you
jason
but
you
something
more
different
i
do
know
who
i
am
i
said
quietly
but
i
me
maybe
for
the
first
time
want
to
help
me
find
out
just
who
that
is
i
put
my
arm
around
her
trying
to
find
a
path
between
memory
and
tomorrow
all
my
life
i
had
walked
a
strange
road
toward
an
unknown
horizon
now
reaching
my
horizon
i
found
it
marked
only
the
rim
of
an
unknown
country
kyla
and
i
would
explore
it
together
the
end
