chapter
i
preliminary
and
discursive
of
jane
austen
s
life
there
is
little
to
tell
and
that
little
has
been
told
more
than
once
by
writers
whose
relationship
to
her
made
them
competent
to
do
so
it
is
impossible
to
make
even
microscopic
additions
to
the
of
the
facts
already
known
of
that
simple
biography
and
if
by
chance
a
few
more
original
letters
were
discovered
they
could
hardly
alter
the
case
for
in
truth
of
her
it
may
be
said
story
there
is
none
to
tell
to
the
very
pertinent
question
which
naturally
follows
reply
may
thus
be
given
jane
austen
stands
absolutely
alone
unapproached
in
a
quality
in
which
women
are
usually
supposed
to
be
deficient
a
humorous
and
brilliant
insight
into
the
foibles
of
human
nature
and
a
strong
sense
of
the
ludicrous
as
a
writer
in
november
neatly
puts
it
of
its
kind
the
comedy
of
jane
austen
is
incomparable
it
is
utterly
merciless
prancing
victims
of
their
illusions
her
men
and
women
are
utterly
bare
to
our
understanding
and
their
gyrations
are
irresistibly
therefore
as
a
personality
as
a
central
figure
too
much
can
not
be
written
about
her
and
however
much
is
said
or
written
the
mystery
of
her
genius
will
still
always
baffle
conjecture
always
lure
men
on
to
fresh
attempts
to
analyse
and
understand
her
the
data
of
jane
austen
s
life
have
been
repeated
several
times
as
has
been
said
but
beyond
a
few
trifling
allusions
to
her
times
no
writer
has
thought
it
necessary
to
show
up
the
background
against
which
her
figure
may
be
seen
or
to
sketch
from
contemporary
records
the
environment
amid
which
she
developed
yet
surely
she
is
even
more
wonderful
as
a
product
of
her
times
than
considered
as
an
isolated
figure
therefore
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
show
her
among
the
scenes
wherein
she
moved
to
sketch
the
men
and
women
to
whom
she
was
accustomed
the
habits
and
manners
of
her
class
and
the
england
with
which
she
was
familiar
her
life
was
not
long
lasting
only
from
to
but
it
covered
notable
times
and
with
such
an
epoch
for
presentation
with
such
a
central
figure
to
link
together
the
sequence
of
events
we
have
a
theme
as
inspiring
as
could
well
be
found
in
many
ways
the
times
of
jane
austen
are
more
removed
from
our
own
than
the
mere
lapse
of
years
seems
to
warrant
the
extraordinary
outburst
of
invention
and
improvement
which
took
place
in
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
lifted
manners
and
customs
in
advance
of
what
two
centuries
of
ordinary
routine
would
have
done
sir
walter
besant
in
his
in
the
eighteenth
says
the
passing
of
the
reform
bill
in
the
introduction
of
steamers
on
the
sea
the
beginning
of
railways
on
land
make
so
vast
a
break
between
the
first
third
and
last
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
i
feel
justified
in
considering
the
eighteenth
century
as
lasting
down
to
the
year
in
other
words
there
were
so
few
changes
and
these
so
slight
in
manners
customs
or
prevalent
ideas
between
and
that
we
may
consider
the
eighteenth
century
as
continuing
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
victorian
era
when
change
after
in
the
constitution
change
in
communications
change
in
the
growth
and
extension
of
trade
change
in
religious
thought
change
in
social
that
new
time
which
we
call
the
nineteenth
according
to
this
reckoning
jane
austen
may
be
counted
as
wholly
an
product
and
such
a
view
is
fully
justified
for
the
differences
between
her
time
and
ours
were
enormous
it
is
impossible
to
summarise
in
a
few
sentences
changes
which
are
essentially
a
matter
of
detail
but
in
the
gradual
unfolding
of
her
life
i
shall
attempt
to
show
how
radically
different
were
her
surroundings
from
anything
to
which
we
are
accustomed
it
is
an
endless
puzzle
why
when
her
books
so
faithfully
represent
the
society
and
manners
of
a
time
so
unlike
our
own
they
seem
so
natural
to
us
if
you
tell
any
people
who
have
not
made
a
special
study
of
the
subject
at
what
date
these
novels
were
written
you
will
find
that
they
are
all
surprised
to
hear
how
many
generations
ago
jane
austen
lived
and
that
they
have
always
vaguely
imagined
her
to
be
very
little
earlier
than
if
not
contemporary
with
charlotte
brontë
or
george
eliot
so
far
as
i
am
aware
no
writer
on
jane
austen
has
ever
touched
on
this
problem
before
her
stories
are
as
fresh
and
real
as
the
day
they
were
written
her
characters
might
be
introduced
to
us
in
the
flesh
any
time
and
with
the
exception
of
a
certain
quaintness
of
flavouring
there
is
nothing
to
bring
before
us
the
striking
difference
between
their
environment
and
our
own
it
is
true
that
the
long
coach
journeys
stand
out
as
an
exception
to
this
but
they
are
the
only
marked
exception
if
we
had
never
had
an
illustrated
edition
of
jane
austen
nine
people
out
of
ten
at
least
would
have
formed
mental
pictures
of
the
characters
dressed
in
early
victorian
or
perhaps
even
in
costume
it
is
only
since
hugh
thompson
and
brock
have
put
before
us
the
costumes
of
the
age
that
our
ideas
have
accommodated
themselves
and
we
realise
how
catherine
morland
and
isabella
thorpe
looked
in
their
plain
gowns
when
they
had
arrived
at
that
stage
of
intimacy
which
enabled
them
to
pin
up
each
other
s
trains
for
the
or
how
attractive
fanny
price
was
in
her
odd
hat
with
its
nodding
plume
and
the
dress
as
she
surveyed
herself
in
the
glass
while
miss
crawford
snapped
the
chain
round
her
neck
the
of
the
men
their
slippers
and
cravats
the
neat
clerical
garb
these
things
we
owe
to
the
artists
are
taken
for
granted
in
the
text
it
would
have
seemed
as
ridiculous
to
jane
austen
to
describe
them
as
for
a
novelist
to
mention
that
a
london
man
made
a
call
in
a
and
yet
her
are
living
and
detailed
filled
in
with
innumerable
little
touches
how
can
we
reconcile
the
seeming
inconsistency
the
explanation
probably
is
that
without
acting
consciously
she
with
the
unerring
touch
of
real
genius
chose
that
which
was
lasting
and
of
interest
for
all
time
from
that
which
was
ephemeral
in
her
sketches
of
human
nature
in
the
strokes
with
which
she
describes
character
no
line
is
too
fine
or
too
delicate
for
her
attention
but
in
the
case
of
manners
and
customs
she
gives
just
the
broad
outlines
that
serve
as
a
setting
her
novels
are
novels
of
character
but
the
problem
is
not
confined
to
the
books
in
her
letters
to
her
sister
though
there
is
abundant
comment
on
dress
food
and
minor
details
which
should
mark
the
epoch
yet
the
letters
might
have
been
written
yesterday
austin
dobson
in
one
of
his
admirable
prefaces
to
the
novels
says
going
over
her
pages
pencil
in
hand
the
antiquarian
annotator
is
struck
by
their
excessive
modernity
and
after
a
prolonged
examination
discovers
in
this
record
nothing
more
fitted
for
the
exercise
of
his
ingenuity
that
such
an
obsolete
game
at
cards
as
casino
or
and
this
is
true
also
of
her
letters
more
remarkable
still
is
the
entire
absence
of
comment
on
the
great
events
which
thrilled
the
world
with
the
exception
of
an
allusion
to
the
death
of
sir
john
moore
we
hear
no
whisper
of
the
wars
and
upheavals
which
happened
during
her
life
it
is
true
that
the
revolution
in
france
which
shook
monarchs
on
their
thrones
occurred
before
the
first
date
of
the
published
letters
yet
her
correspondence
covers
a
time
when
battles
at
sea
were
chronicled
almost
continuously
when
an
invasion
by
france
was
an
terror
trafalgar
and
waterloo
were
not
history
but
contemporary
events
but
though
jane
must
have
heard
and
discussed
these
matters
no
echo
finds
its
way
into
her
lively
and
amusing
budgets
of
to
her
sister
of
course
women
were
not
supposed
to
read
the
papers
in
those
days
but
with
two
sailor
brothers
the
news
must
have
often
been
personal
and
intimate
and
she
was
according
to
the
notions
of
her
time
well
educated
yet
we
search
in
vain
for
any
allusion
to
such
contemporary
matters
it
may
be
objected
that
the
letters
of
a
modern
girl
to
a
sister
would
hardly
touch
on
questions
which
agitate
the
public
but
there
are
several
replies
to
this
in
the
first
place
few
such
exciting
events
have
occurred
in
recent
times
as
happened
during
jane
austen
s
life
our
war
in
africa
was
a
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
bloody
field
of
waterloo
where
blucher
and
wellington
lost
men
or
the
thrilling
naval
victory
of
trafalgar
and
stupendous
as
have
been
the
recent
battles
between
russia
and
japan
they
affect
us
only
is
not
herself
involved
in
them
nor
are
her
sons
being
slain
daily
in
the
second
place
surely
even
the
south
african
war
would
probably
produce
some
comment
in
letters
especially
if
the
writer
had
brothers
in
the
army
as
jane
had
brothers
in
the
navy
thirdly
letters
in
jane
austen
s
time
were
one
great
means
of
news
for
newspapers
were
not
so
easy
to
get
and
were
much
more
costly
than
now
so
that
we
expect
to
find
more
of
contemporary
events
in
letters
than
at
a
time
like
the
present
when
telegrams
and
columns
of
print
save
us
the
trouble
of
recording
such
matters
in
private
in
the
years
between
and
vast
discoveries
of
importance
were
made
when
jane
austen
was
born
captain
cook
was
still
in
the
midst
of
his
exploration
and
the
map
of
the
world
was
being
unrolled
day
by
day
though
new
zealand
and
australia
had
been
discovered
by
the
dutch
in
the
previous
century
they
were
all
but
unknown
to
england
six
years
only
before
her
birth
had
the
great
navigator
charted
and
mapped
new
zealand
for
the
first
time
also
the
east
coast
of
australia
and
had
christened
new
south
wales
when
she
was
four
years
old
cook
was
murdered
by
the
natives
at
hawaii
the
atlas
from
which
she
learnt
her
earliest
geography
lessons
was
therefore
very
different
from
those
now
in
use
the
cartographer
dunn
published
an
atlas
in
where
australia
is
marked
certainly
but
as
though
one
saw
it
through
distorted
glasses
the
east
coast
cook
s
discovery
is
clearly
defined
the
rest
is
very
vague
and
the
fact
that
tasmania
was
an
island
had
not
then
been
discovered
for
it
appears
as
a
projecting
headland
in
the
same
general
way
is
new
zealand
treated
and
neither
has
a
separate
sheet
to
itself
beyond
their
appearance
on
the
map
of
the
world
they
are
ignored
japan
also
looks
queer
to
modern
eyes
it
almost
touches
china
at
both
ends
enclosing
a
sea
the
epoch
was
one
of
change
and
enlargement
in
other
than
geographical
directions
in
the
thirty
years
before
jane
austen
s
birth
an
immense
improvement
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
women
montagu
in
had
made
bold
strokes
for
the
freedom
and
recognition
of
her
sex
the
epithet
which
has
survived
with
such
extraordinary
tenacity
was
at
first
given
not
to
the
clever
women
who
attended
montagu
s
informal
receptions
but
to
her
men
friends
who
were
allowed
to
come
in
the
grey
or
blue
worsted
stockings
of
daily
life
instead
of
the
black
silk
considered
for
parties
up
to
this
time
personal
appearance
and
cards
had
been
the
sole
resources
for
a
leisured
dame
of
the
upper
classes
and
the
language
of
gallantry
was
the
only
one
considered
fitting
for
her
to
hear
by
montagu
s
efforts
it
was
gradually
recognised
that
a
woman
might
not
only
have
sense
herself
but
might
prefer
it
should
be
spoken
to
her
and
that
because
the
minds
of
women
had
long
been
left
uncultivated
they
were
not
on
that
account
unworthy
of
cultivation
hannah
more
describes
montagu
as
not
only
the
finest
genius
but
the
finest
lady
i
ever
saw
her
form
for
she
has
no
body
is
delicate
even
to
fragility
her
countenance
the
most
animated
in
the
world
the
sprightly
vivacity
of
fifteen
with
the
judgment
and
experience
of
a
in
art
there
had
never
before
been
seen
in
england
such
a
trio
of
masters
as
reynolds
gainsborough
and
romney
isolated
portrait
painters
of
brilliant
genius
though
not
always
native
born
there
had
been
in
england
vandyke
lely
kneller
and
hogarth
are
all
in
the
first
rank
that
three
such
men
as
the
trio
above
should
flourish
contemporaneously
was
little
short
of
miraculous
in
sir
joshua
had
passed
the
zenith
of
his
fame
though
he
lived
until
gainsborough
who
was
established
in
a
studio
in
schomberg
house
pall
mall
was
in
at
the
beginning
of
his
most
successful
years
his
rooms
were
crowded
with
sitters
of
both
sexes
and
no
one
considered
they
had
proved
their
position
in
society
until
they
had
received
the
of
being
painted
by
him
he
was
only
at
his
death
in
romney
who
lived
to
never
took
quite
the
same
rank
as
the
other
two
yet
he
was
popular
enough
at
the
same
time
as
gainsborough
lady
newdigate
cheverels
of
cheverel
mentions
going
to
have
her
portrait
painted
by
him
and
says
that
he
insists
upon
my
having
a
rich
white
satin
with
a
long
train
made
by
tuesday
and
to
have
it
left
with
him
all
the
summer
it
is
the
oddest
thing
i
ever
sir
thomas
lawrence
and
hoppner
carried
on
the
traditions
of
the
portrait
painters
the
former
living
to
with
names
such
as
these
it
is
easy
to
judge
art
was
in
a
flourishing
condition
among
contemporary
landscape
painters
richard
wilson
who
has
been
called
the
founder
of
english
landscape
lived
until
but
his
views
though
vastly
more
natural
than
the
stilted
conventional
style
that
preceded
them
seem
to
our
modern
eyes
trained
to
what
is
natural
still
to
be
too
much
conventionalised
among
others
the
names
of
gillray
morland
rowlandson
stand
out
all
well
on
the
way
to
fame
while
jane
was
still
a
child
these
preliminary
remarks
have
been
made
with
a
view
to
giving
some
general
idea
of
that
england
into
which
she
was
born
and
they
refer
to
those
subjects
which
only
affected
her
indirectly
all
those
things
which
entered
directly
into
her
life
such
as
her
country
surroundings
contemporary
books
prices
of
food
fashions
and
a
host
of
minor
details
are
dealt
with
more
particularly
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
as
we
have
said
matters
of
history
are
not
mentioned
or
noticed
in
jane
austen
s
correspondence
which
is
taken
up
with
her
own
environment
her
neighbours
their
habits
and
manners
and
illumined
throughout
by
a
bright
insight
at
times
rather
too
biting
to
be
altogether
pleasant
of
her
immediate
surroundings
we
have
a
very
clear
idea
of
all
the
writers
of
fiction
jane
austen
is
most
thoroughly
english
she
never
went
abroad
and
though
her
native
good
sense
and
shrewd
gift
of
observation
saved
her
from
becoming
insular
yet
she
can
not
be
conceived
as
writing
of
any
but
the
sweet
villages
and
the
provincial
towns
of
her
native
country
even
the
brontës
deeply
secluded
as
their
lives
were
crossed
the
german
ocean
and
saw
something
of
continental
life
from
their
school
at
brussels
nothing
of
this
kind
fell
to
jane
austen
s
share
yet
people
did
travel
in
those
days
travelled
amazingly
considering
the
difficulties
they
had
to
encounter
among
which
were
the
horrors
of
a
with
its
uncertain
hours
fielding
in
going
to
lisbon
was
kept
waiting
a
month
for
favourable
winds
there
was
also
the
terrible
embarking
and
landing
from
a
small
boat
before
such
conveniences
as
were
built
in
one
of
lord
langdale
s
letters
dated
we
have
a
vivid
description
of
these
horrors
we
left
that
place
dover
about
six
o
clock
last
saturday
morning
and
arrived
at
calais
at
four
in
the
afternoon
our
passage
was
rather
disagreeable
the
wind
being
chiefly
against
us
and
rain
sometimes
falling
in
torrents
i
never
witnessed
a
more
curious
scene
than
our
landing
when
the
had
come
to
within
two
miles
of
the
coast
of
france
we
were
met
by
some
french
rowing
boats
in
which
we
were
to
be
conveyed
on
shore
the
french
sailors
surrounded
us
in
the
most
clamorous
and
noisy
manner
leaping
into
the
packet
and
bawling
and
shouting
so
loud
as
to
alarm
the
ladies
on
board
very
much
to
these
men
however
we
were
to
consign
ourselves
and
we
entered
their
boats
eight
passengers
going
in
each
when
we
got
near
the
shore
we
were
told
it
was
impossible
for
the
boat
to
get
close
to
land
on
account
of
the
tide
being
so
low
and
that
we
must
be
carried
on
the
men
s
shoulders
we
had
no
time
to
reflect
on
this
plan
before
we
saw
twelve
or
fourteen
men
running
into
the
water
surrounded
our
boat
and
laid
hold
of
it
with
such
violence
that
one
might
have
thought
they
meant
to
sink
it
and
fairly
pulled
us
into
their
arms
for
my
part
i
laughed
heartily
all
the
time
but
a
lady
who
was
with
us
was
so
much
frighted
that
i
was
obliged
to
support
her
in
my
arms
a
considerable
time
before
she
was
able
to
it
was
not
only
in
the
arms
of
men
that
passengers
were
thus
carried
ashore
in
s
british
visitors
and
by
alger
there
is
a
still
more
extraordinary
account
quoted
from
a
contemporary
letter
in
an
instant
the
boathead
was
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
women
up
to
their
middles
and
over
who
were
there
to
carry
us
on
shore
not
being
aware
of
this
manœuvre
we
did
not
throw
ourselves
into
the
arms
of
these
so
instantly
as
we
ought
whereby
those
who
sat
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
were
deluged
with
sea
spray
for
myself
i
was
in
front
and
very
quickly
understood
the
clamour
of
the
mermaids
i
flung
myself
upon
the
backs
of
two
of
them
without
reserve
and
was
safely
and
dryly
borne
on
shore
but
one
poor
gentleman
slipped
through
their
fingers
and
fell
over
head
and
ears
into
the
from
the
same
entertaining
book
we
learn
that
for
you
could
get
a
through
ticket
by
dover
and
calais
starting
either
from
the
city
at
by
the
old
and
now
revived
line
of
coaches
connected
with
the
rue
notre
dame
des
victoires
establishment
in
paris
or
morning
and
night
by
a
new
line
from
charing
cross
probably
a
still
cheaper
route
though
there
were
no
through
tickets
was
by
brighton
and
dieppe
the
crossing
taking
ten
or
fifteen
hours
by
calais
it
seldom
took
more
than
eight
hours
but
passengers
were
advised
to
carry
light
refreshments
with
them
the
diligence
from
calais
to
paris
going
only
four
miles
an
hour
took
hours
for
the
journey
but
a
handsome
carriage
drawn
by
three
horses
in
a
style
somewhat
similar
to
the
english
could
be
hired
by
four
or
five
and
this
made
six
miles
an
during
a
great
part
of
jane
austen
s
life
much
of
the
continent
was
closed
to
english
people
because
of
the
perpetual
state
of
war
between
us
and
either
spain
or
france
but
in
any
case
such
an
expedition
would
seem
to
have
lain
quite
outside
her
limited
daily
round
and
was
never
even
mooted
steventon
rectory
where
she
was
born
on
december
has
long
ago
vanished
and
a
new
rectory
more
in
accordance
with
modern
luxurious
notions
has
been
built
of
the
old
house
lord
brabourne
to
jane
austen
writes
the
house
standing
in
the
valley
was
somewhat
better
than
the
ordinary
parsonage
houses
of
the
day
the
hedgerows
were
beautiful
and
the
country
around
sufficiently
picturesque
for
those
who
have
the
good
taste
to
admire
country
steventon
is
a
very
small
place
lying
in
a
network
of
lanes
about
seven
miles
from
basingstoke
the
nearest
points
on
the
are
deane
on
the
andover
road
and
popham
lane
on
the
winchester
road
there
is
an
inn
at
the
corner
of
popham
lane
to
this
day
and
that
there
was
an
inn
there
in
jane
austen
s
time
we
know
for
lybbe
powys
writing
in
says
we
stopped
at
winchester
and
lay
that
night
at
a
most
excellent
inn
at
popham
at
this
time
curiously
enough
her
were
cooper
jane
austen
s
uncle
and
his
son
and
daughter
though
whether
the
party
made
a
détour
to
visit
the
rectory
we
do
not
know
of
course
at
that
time
jane
was
of
no
greater
importance
than
any
daughter
of
a
country
clergyman
and
there
would
be
no
reason
to
mention
her
it
is
difficult
to
find
steventon
so
little
is
there
of
it
and
that
so
much
scattered
a
few
cottages
a
farm
and
beyond
half
a
mile
away
the
church
with
a
pump
in
a
field
near
to
mark
the
site
of
the
old
rectory
house
where
jane
austen
was
born
this
is
all
that
remains
of
her
time
the
new
rectory
stands
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
road
raised
above
it
and
sheltered
by
a
warm
backing
of
trees
in
which
evergreens
are
conspicuous
a
very
building
it
is
much
superior
to
what
was
considered
good
enough
for
a
clergyman
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
country
is
well
wooded
and
the
roads
undulating
so
that
there
are
no
distant
views
probably
a
good
deal
of
the
planting
has
been
done
since
jane
austen
s
time
but
that
there
were
trees
then
we
know
from
her
own
account
and
some
of
the
fine
oaks
that
still
stand
can
have
altered
but
little
since
then
s
account
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
is
worth
north
of
the
house
the
road
from
deane
to
popham
lane
ran
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
front
to
allow
a
carriage
drive
through
turf
and
trees
on
the
south
side
the
ground
rose
gently
and
was
occupied
by
one
of
those
gardens
in
which
vegetables
and
flowers
are
combined
flanked
and
protected
on
the
east
by
one
of
the
thatched
mud
walls
common
in
that
country
and
overshadowed
by
fine
elms
along
the
upper
or
southern
side
of
this
garden
ran
a
terrace
of
the
finest
turf
which
must
have
been
in
the
writer
s
thoughts
when
she
described
catherine
morland
s
childish
delight
in
rolling
down
the
green
slope
at
the
back
of
the
though
there
is
so
little
left
to
see
and
the
church
has
been
restored
yet
it
is
worth
while
to
pass
through
this
country
to
realise
the
environment
in
which
the
authoress
spent
her
childhood
there
are
still
left
in
the
neighbourhood
notably
at
north
waltham
some
of
the
old
brick
houses
with
thatched
roofs
to
which
she
must
have
been
accustomed
the
gentle
curves
of
the
roads
the
oak
and
beech
and
fir
overshadowing
the
sweet
lanes
the
wild
clematis
which
grows
so
abundantly
that
in
autumn
it
looks
like
covering
all
the
hedgerows
these
things
were
prominent
objects
in
the
scenery
amid
which
she
lived
it
is
not
likely
she
looked
on
her
surroundings
in
the
same
way
as
any
ordinarily
educated
person
would
now
look
on
them
love
of
scenery
had
not
then
been
developed
the
artificial
and
formal
landscape
gardening
with
made
waterfalls
was
the
correct
thing
to
admire
genuine
nature
much
less
homely
nature
was
only
then
beginning
to
be
observed
this
is
strange
to
us
for
as
professor
geikie
says
at
no
time
in
our
history
as
a
nation
has
the
scenery
of
the
land
we
live
in
been
so
intelligently
appreciated
as
it
is
but
jane
was
not
in
advance
of
her
times
and
though
she
loved
her
trees
and
flowers
we
find
in
her
writings
no
reflections
of
the
scenes
amid
which
she
daily
walked
in
her
books
scenery
is
simply
ignored
we
know
if
it
rained
because
that
material
fact
had
an
influence
on
the
actions
of
her
heroines
but
beyond
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
yet
she
greatly
admired
cowper
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
natural
poets
her
own
nephew
speaks
of
the
scenery
around
her
first
home
as
tame
and
says
that
it
has
no
grand
or
extensive
views
though
he
admits
it
has
its
beauties
and
says
that
steventon
from
the
fall
of
the
ground
and
the
abundance
of
its
timber
is
certainly
one
of
the
prettiest
but
this
quiet
prettiness
without
the
excessive
richness
to
be
found
in
other
villages
is
perhaps
more
thoroughly
characteristic
of
england
than
any
other
the
impressions
of
childhood
are
invariably
deep
and
are
cut
with
a
clearness
and
minuteness
to
which
none
others
of
later
times
attain
just
as
a
child
examines
a
picture
in
a
with
anxious
and
searching
care
while
an
adult
gains
only
a
general
impression
of
the
whole
so
a
child
knows
the
place
where
it
has
played
in
such
detail
that
every
bough
of
the
trees
every
root
of
the
lilacs
every
tiny
depression
or
ditch
is
familiar
and
thus
jane
must
have
known
the
home
at
steventon
writing
about
a
storm
in
she
says
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
of
our
two
highly
valued
elms
descend
into
the
sweep
the
other
which
had
fallen
i
suppose
in
the
first
crash
and
which
was
the
nearest
to
the
pond
taking
a
more
easterly
direction
sunk
amid
our
screen
of
chestnuts
and
firs
knocking
down
one
spruce
fir
beating
off
the
head
of
another
and
stripping
the
two
corner
chestnuts
of
several
branches
in
its
fall
this
is
not
all
one
large
elm
out
of
the
two
on
the
side
as
you
enter
what
i
call
the
elm
walk
was
likewise
blown
down
the
maple
bearing
the
weathercock
was
broke
in
two
and
what
i
regret
more
than
all
the
rest
is
that
all
the
three
elms
which
grew
in
hall
s
meadow
and
gave
such
ornament
to
it
are
this
bespeaks
her
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
trees
of
which
each
one
was
a
friend
the
country
and
the
writer
suited
each
other
so
wonderfully
that
one
pauses
for
a
moment
wondering
whether
after
all
environment
may
not
have
that
magic
influence
claimed
for
it
by
some
who
hold
it
to
be
more
powerful
than
inherited
qualities
influence
of
course
it
has
and
one
wonders
what
could
possibly
have
been
the
result
if
two
such
natures
as
those
of
jane
austen
and
charlotte
brontë
had
changed
places
if
jane
had
been
brought
up
amid
the
wild
bleak
yorkshire
moors
and
charlotte
amid
the
pleasant
fields
of
hampshire
as
it
is
the
surroundings
of
each
intensified
and
developed
their
own
peculiar
genius
jane
was
born
of
the
middle
class
her
father
george
austen
being
a
clergyman
in
a
day
when
clergymen
were
none
too
well
thought
of
yet
taking
a
better
position
than
most
by
reason
of
his
own
family
and
good
connections
george
austen
had
early
been
left
an
orphan
and
had
been
adopted
by
an
uncle
he
showed
the
possession
of
brains
by
obtaining
first
a
scholarship
at
john
s
college
oxford
and
subsequently
a
fellowship
he
took
orders
which
in
the
days
when
rectories
were
looked
upon
simply
as
livings
was
a
recognised
mode
of
providing
for
a
young
man
whether
he
had
any
vocation
for
the
ministry
or
not
but
he
seems
to
have
fulfilled
his
duties
or
what
were
then
considered
sufficient
duties
creditably
enough
of
george
austen
one
of
his
sons
he
resided
in
the
conscientious
and
unassisted
discharge
of
his
ministerial
duties
until
he
was
turned
of
seventy
he
was
a
profound
scholar
and
had
exquisite
taste
in
every
species
of
the
subject
of
the
clergy
at
that
date
and
the
examples
of
them
which
jane
has
herself
given
us
in
her
books
is
an
interesting
one
and
we
shall
return
to
it
the
rectory
of
steventon
was
presented
to
george
austen
by
knight
the
same
cousin
who
afterwards
adopted
his
son
edward
and
the
rectory
of
deane
a
small
place
about
a
mile
distant
was
bought
by
an
uncle
who
had
educated
him
and
given
to
him
the
villages
were
very
small
only
containing
about
three
hundred
persons
altogether
in
those
days
parish
visiting
or
parochial
clubs
and
entertainments
were
unthought
of
sunday
schools
in
their
earliest
infancy
and
we
hear
nothing
whatever
throughout
the
whole
of
jane
austen
s
correspondence
which
leads
us
to
think
that
she
in
any
way
carried
out
the
duties
which
in
these
days
fall
to
the
lot
of
every
clergyman
s
daughter
this
is
not
to
cast
blame
upon
her
it
only
means
that
she
was
the
child
of
her
times
these
things
had
not
then
been
organised

her

a

and
man
these
things
are
not
of
importance
in
themselves
but
they
serve
to
show
that
the
family
from
which
jane
sprang
was
on
both
sides
of
some
consideration
the
austens
lived
first
at
deane
but
moved
to
steventon
in
they
had
undertaken
the
charge
of
a
son
of
warren
hastings
who
died
young
and
they
had
a
large
family
of
their
own
as
was
consistent
in
days
when
families
of
ten
eleven
and
even
fifteen
were
no
uncommon
thing
there
were
five
sons
and
two
daughters
in
all
and
jane
was
the
youngest
but
one
see
table
p
james
the
eldest
was
probably
too
far
removed
in
age
from
his
younger
sister
ever
to
have
been
very
intimate
with
her
it
is
said
that
he
had
some
share
in
her
reading
and
in
forming
her
taste
but
though
she
was
very
fond
of
him
she
never
seems
as
was
very
natural
to
have
had
quite
the
same
degree
of
intimate
affection
for
him
as
she
felt
for
those
of
her
brothers
nearer
to
her
own
age
james
was
twice
married
and
his
only
daughter
by
his
first
wife
was
anna
of
whom
jane
makes
frequent
mention
in
her
letters
and
to
whom
some
of
the
published
correspondence
was
addressed
his
second
wife
was
mary
lloyd
whose
sister
martha
was
the
very
devoted
friend
and
frequent
guest
of
the
girl
austens
and
who
late
in
life
married
francis
one
of
jane
s
younger
brothers
the
son
of
james
and
mary
was
james
edward
who
took
the
additional
name
of
leigh
and
was
the
writer
of
the
which
supplies
one
of
the
only
two
sources
of
authoritative
information
about
jane
austen
he
died
in
the
next
brother
edward
as
already
stated
was
adopted
by
his
cousin
knight
whose
name
he
took
he
came
into
the
fine
properties
of
chawton
house
in
hampshire
and
godmersham
in
kent
even
during
the
lifetime
of
knight
s
widow
who
looked
on
him
as
a
son
and
retired
in
his
favour
edward
married
elizabeth
bridges
and
had
a
family
of
eleven
children
of
whom
the
eldest
fanny
catherine
married
sir
edward
knatchbull
and
their
eldest
son
was
created
lord
brabourne
to
him
we
owe
the
which
are
the
second
of
the
authoritative
books
on
jane
austen
jane
austen
was
attached
to
her
niece
fanny
knight
in
a
degree
only
second
to
that
of
her
attachment
to
her
own
sister
cassandra
fanny
s
mother
edward
austen
or
knight
for
the
change
of
name
seems
not
to
have
taken
place
until
her
death
died
comparatively
young
and
the
great
responsibility
thrown
upon
fanny
doubtless
made
her
seem
older
and
more
companionable
than
her
years
of
her
her
famous
aunt
i
found
her
in
the
summer
just
what
you
describe
almost
another
sister
and
could
not
have
supposed
that
a
niece
would
ever
have
been
so
much
to
me
she
is
quite
after
one
s
own
heart
give
her
my
best
love
and
tell
her
that
i
always
think
of
her
with
the
third
austen
brother
henry
interested
himself
much
in
his
sister
s
writing
and
saw
about
the
business
arrangements
for
her
when
after
many
years
she
decided
to
publish
one
of
her
own
books
at
her
own
risk
he
was
something
of
a
rolling
stone
filling
various
positions
in
turn
and
at
length
taking
orders
and
succeeding
his
brother
james
in
the
steventon
living
during
part
of
his
life
he
lived
in
london
where
jane
often
stayed
with
him
he
married
first
his
cousin
eliza
the
daughter
of
george
austen
s
sister
she
was
the
widow
of
a
frenchman
the
count
de
feuillade
who
had
suffered
death
by
the
guillotine
eliza
was
very
popular
with
her
girl
cousins
as
we
can
see
from
jane
s
remarks
she
died
in
and
in
henry
married
eleanor
daughter
of
henry
jackson
the
two
youngest
brothers
francis
and
charles
came
above
and
below
jane
with
about
three
years
interval
on
either
side
they
both
entered
the
navy
and
both
became
admirals
frank
rose
to
be
senior
admiral
of
the
fleet
and
was
created
he
lived
to
be
he
like
another
of
his
brothers
was
twice
married
habit
that
ran
abnormally
in
the
family
his
second
wife
was
martha
the
sister
of
his
brother
james
s
wife
mentioned
above
charles
married
first
fanny
palmer
and
was
left
a
widower
in
with
three
small
daughters
he
married
secondly
her
sister
harriet
the
two
fannies
charles
austen
and
the
eldest
daughter
of
edward
knight
sometimes
cause
a
little
confusion
jane
austen
mentions
calling
with
the
younger
fanny
on
the
motherless
children
of
her
brother
one
of
whom
was
also
fanny
soon
after
their
loss
we
got
to
keppel
street
however
which
was
all
i
cared
for
and
though
we
could
only
stay
a
quarter
of
an
hour
fanny
s
calling
gave
great
pleasure
and
her
sensibility
still
greater
for
she
was
very
much
affected
at
the
sight
of
the
children
little
fanny
looked
heavy
we
saw
the
whole
it
has
been
necessary
to
give
a
few
details
respecting
the
brothers
who
played
so
large
a
part
in
jane
s
life
because
her
visits
away
from
home
were
nearly
all
to
their
houses
her
letters
are
full
of
allusions
to
them
and
the
great
family
affection
which
subsisted
between
them
all
made
the
griefs
and
joys
of
the
others
the
greatest
events
in
a
very
uneventful
life
the
dearest
however
of
the
whole
family
was
the
one
sister
cassandra
who
like
jane
herself
never
married
which
seems
the
stranger
when
we
consider
how
many
of
the
brothers
married
twice
there
was
a
sad
little
in
cassandra
s
life
she
was
engaged
to
a
young
clergyman
who
had
promise
of
promotion
from
a
nobleman
related
to
him
he
accompanied
this
patron
to
the
west
indies
as
chaplain
to
the
regiment
and
there
died
of
yellow
fever
there
is
perhaps
something
more
pathetic
in
such
a
tale
than
in
any
other
the
glowing
ideal
has
not
been
smirched
by
any
touch
of
the
actual
sordid
daily
life
it
is
snatched
away
and
remains
an
ideal
always
and
the
happiness
that
might
have
been
is
enhanced
by
romance
so
as
to
be
a
greater
deprivation
than
any
loss
of
the
actual
the
two
sisters
were
sisters
in
reality
sharing
the
same
views
the
same
friendships
the
same
interests
when
away
jane
s
letters
to
cassandra
are
full
and
lively
telling
of
all
the
numberless
little
events
that
only
a
sister
can
enjoy
and
if
jane
s
own
estimate
is
to
be
believed
cassandra
s
are
to
the
full
as
vivacious
the
letter
which
i
have
this
moment
received
from
you
has
diverted
me
beyond
moderation
i
could
die
of
laughter
at
it
as
they
used
to
say
at
school
you
are
indeed
the
finest
comic
writer
of
the
present
cassandra
lived
to
long
enough
to
see
that
her
beloved
sister
s
letters
would
in
all
probability
be
published
she
was
of
a
reticent
nature
with
a
strong
dislike
to
revealing
anything
personal
or
intimate
to
the
public
she
therefore
went
through
all
these
neatly
written
letters
from
jane
which
she
had
so
carefully
preserved
and
destroyed
anything
of
a
personal
nature
one
can
not
altogether
condemn
the
action
greatly
as
we
have
been
the
losers
the
letters
that
remain
many
in
number
deal
almost
entirely
with
outside
matters
trivialities
of
everyday
life
and
they
are
written
so
brightly
that
we
can
judge
how
interesting
the
bits
of
by
so
expressive
a
pen
would
have
been
in
when
published
his
only
one
or
two
of
jane
austen
s
letters
were
available
but
in
on
the
death
of
lady
knatchbull
fanny
knight
the
letters
above
referred
to
which
cassandra
austen
had
retained
were
found
among
her
belongings
having
come
to
her
on
her
aunt
s
death
her
son
created
lord
brabourne
therefore
published
these
in
two
volumes
in
and
when
quotations
and
extracts
are
given
in
this
book
without
further
explanation
it
must
be
inferred
that
these
are
taken
from
letters
of
jane
to
cassandra
as
given
by
lord
brabourne
chapter
ii
childhood
of
jane
austen
s
childhood
in
the
quiet
country
rectory
we
know
little
probably
because
there
is
not
a
great
deal
to
know
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
to
put
babies
out
to
nurse
in
the
village
sometimes
until
they
were
as
much
as
two
years
old
a
point
often
overlooked
when
the
mothers
of
what
is
now
extolled
as
a
domestic
period
are
held
up
as
patterns
to
a
more
intellectual
and
roving
generation
certainly
it
was
an
easy
and
cheap
method
of
getting
rid
of
the
care
and
trouble
involved
by
a
baby
in
the
house
and
it
probably
answered
well
as
the
child
would
learn
to
do
without
too
much
attention
and
at
an
early
age
faddists
notwithstanding
could
hardly
suffer
from
any
influence
of
its
surroundings
other
than
physically
and
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
material
necessities
were
well
provided
and
kept
under
supervision
nevertheless
a
mother
who
adopted
this
course
at
the
present
day
could
hardly
escape
the
epithet
of
heartless
which
would
assuredly
be
levelled
at
her
in
the
time
of
jane
s
childhood
the
old
days
of
rigid
severity
toward
children
were
past
no
longer
were
mere
babies
taken
to
see
executions
and
whipped
on
their
return
to
enforce
the
example
they
had
beheld
in
fact
a
period
of
undue
indulgence
had
set
in
as
a
reaction
but
this
does
not
seem
to
have
affected
the
austen
family
who
were
brought
up
very
wisely
and
perhaps
even
a
little
more
repressively
than
would
be
the
case
in
a
similar
household
jane
herself
was
evidently
a
diffident
child
she
says
of
a
little
visitor
many
years
afterwards
our
little
visitor
has
just
left
us
and
left
us
highly
pleased
with
her
she
is
a
nice
natural
affectionate
girl
with
all
the
ready
civility
one
sees
in
the
best
children
in
the
present
day
so
unlike
anything
that
i
was
myself
at
her
age
that
i
am
often
all
astonishment
and
shame
what
is
become
of
all
the
shyness
in
the
world
moral
as
well
as
natural
diseases
disappear
in
the
progress
of
time
and
new
ones
take
their
place
shyness
and
the
sweating
sickness
have
given
way
to
confidence
and
paralytic
her
own
attitude
toward
children
is
peculiar
though
on
indisputable
testimony
she
was
the
most
popular
and
best
loved
of
aunts
the
fact
remains
that
she
had
no
great
insight
into
child
nature
nor
does
she
seem
to
have
had
any
general
love
of
children
beyond
those
who
were
specially
connected
with
her
by
close
ties
she
loved
her
nieces
but
much
more
as
they
grew
older
than
as
children
says
aunt
jane
was
the
delight
of
all
her
nephews
and
nieces
we
did
not
think
of
her
as
being
clever
still
less
as
being
famous
but
we
valued
her
as
one
always
kind
sympathising
and
amusing
and
he
quotes
the
testimony
of
another
aunt
jane
was
the
general
favourite
with
children
her
ways
with
them
being
so
playful
and
her
long
circumstantial
stories
so
and
again
her
first
charm
to
children
was
great
sweetness
of
manner
she
could
make
everything
amusing
to
a
the
truth
probably
is
that
her
innate
kindness
of
heart
and
unselfishness
compelled
her
to
be
as
amusing
as
possible
when
thrown
with
little
people
but
perhaps
because
she
took
so
much
trouble
to
entertain
them
she
found
children
more
tiresome
than
other
people
who
accept
their
company
more
placidly
however
this
may
be
it
is
undeniable
that
the
attitude
she
takes
toward
children
in
her
books
is
almost
always
that
of
their
being
tiresome
there
never
appears
any
genuine
love
for
them
or
realisation
of
pleasure
in
their
society
and
she
continually
satirises
the
foolish
weakness
of
their
doting
parents
it
is
recorded
as
a
great
feature
in
the
character
of
john
knightley
that
in
spite
of
her
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance
all
the
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
and
playing
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for
without
the
smallest
delay
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him
their
grandfather
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
poor
anne
in
is
tormented
by
the
younger
boy
a
remarkably
stout
forward
child
of
two
years
old
as
his
aunt
would
not
let
him
tease
his
sick
brother
he
began
to
fasten
himself
upon
her
in
such
a
way
that
busy
as
she
was
about
charles
she
could
not
shake
him
off
she
spoke
to
him
ordered
entreated
insisted
in
vain
once
she
did
contrive
to
push
him
away
but
the
boy
had
the
greater
pleasure
in
getting
upon
her
back
again
perhaps
to
anne
this
annoyance
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
as
it
brought
forward
the
whilom
lover
to
her
assistance
but
that
is
beside
the
point
the
children
of
lady
middleton
in
and
are
particularly
badly
behaved
and
odious
fortunately
for
those
who
pay
their
court
through
such
foibles
a
fond
mother
though
in
pursuit
of
praise
for
her
children
the
most
rapacious
of
human
beings
is
likewise
the
most
credulous
her
demands
are
exorbitant
but
she
will
swallow
anything
and
the
excessive
affection
and
endurance
of
the
miss
steeles
towards
her
offspring
were
reviewed
therefore
by
lady
middleton
without
the
smallest
surprise
or
distrust
she
saw
with
maternal
complacency
all
the
impertinent
encroachments
and
mischievous
tricks
to
which
her
cousins
submitted
she
saw
their
sashes
untied
their
hair
pulled
about
their
ears
their
workbags
searched
and
their
knives
and
scissors
stolen
away
and
felt
no
doubt
of
its
being
a
reciprocal
enjoyment
john
is
in
such
spirits
said
she
on
his
taking
miss
steele
s
and
throwing
it
out
of
the
window
he
is
full
of
and
soon
afterwards
on
the
second
boy
s
violently
pinching
one
of
the
same
lady
s
fingers
she
fondly
observed
how
playful
william
is
and
here
is
my
sweet
little
she
added
tenderly
caressing
a
little
girl
of
three
years
old
who
had
not
made
a
noise
for
the
last
two
minutes
and
she
is
always
so
gentle
and
quiet
never
was
there
such
a
quiet
little
thing
but
unfortunately
in
bestowing
these
embraces
a
pin
in
her
ladyship
s
slightly
scratching
the
child
s
neck
produced
from
this
pattern
of
gentleness
such
violent
screams
as
could
hardly
be
outdone
by
any
creature
professedly
noisy
her
mouth
stuffed
with
she
still
screamed
and
sobbed
lustily
and
kicked
her
two
brothers
for
offering
to
touch
her
i
have
a
notion
said
lucy
to
elinor
you
think
the
little
middletons
are
too
much
indulged
perhaps
they
may
be
the
outside
of
enough
but
it
is
so
natural
in
lady
middleton
and
for
my
part
i
love
to
see
children
full
of
life
and
spirits
i
can
not
bear
them
if
they
are
tame
and
i
confess
replied
elinor
that
while
i
am
at
barton
park
i
never
think
of
tame
and
quiet
children
with
any
abhorrence
those
children
in
the
novels
who
are
not
detestable
are
usually
such
as
henry
and
john
knightley
little
boys
not
distinguished
by
any
individuality
others
are
merely
pegs
on
which
to
hang
their
parents
follies
such
as
little
harry
dashwood
who
serves
his
parents
as
an
excuse
for
their
unutterable
meanness
the
fact
remains
there
are
only
two
passable
children
in
the
whole
gallery
and
one
is
the
slightest
of
slight
sketches
in
that
and
story
here
the
little
boy
charles
spoken
of
as
mrs
blake
s
little
boy
is
a
real
child
who
at
his
first
ball
when
thrown
over
remorselessly
by
his
partner
though
the
picture
of
disappointment
with
crimsoned
cheeks
quivering
lips
and
eyes
bent
on
the
floor
yet
contrives
to
utter
bravely
oh
i
do
not
mind
it
and
whose
naïve
enjoyment
at
dancing
with
emma
watson
who
offers
herself
as
a
substitute
is
well
done
his
conversation
with
her
is
also
very
natural
and
his
cry
oh
uncle
do
look
at
my
partner
she
is
so
pretty
is
a
human
touch
illustration
juvenile
retirement
the
other
instance
is
a
sample
of
a
very
nervous
shy
child
perhaps
drawn
from
the
recollections
of
jane
austen
s
own
feelings
in
childhood
this
is
fanny
price
whose
loneliness
on
her
first
coming
to
mansfield
park
is
carefully
depicted
but
fanny
herself
is
unchildlike
and
exceptional
her
younger
brothers
rank
among
the
gallery
of
bad
children
for
by
the
superior
noise
of
sam
tom
and
charles
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
stairs
and
tumbling
about
and
hallooing
fanny
was
almost
stunned
sam
loud
and
overbearing
as
he
was
was
clever
and
intelligent
tom
and
charles
being
at
least
as
many
years
as
they
were
his
juniors
distant
from
that
age
of
feeling
and
reason
which
might
suggest
the
expediency
of
making
friends
and
of
endeavouring
to
be
less
disagreeable
their
sister
soon
despaired
of
making
any
impression
on
them
they
were
quite
untamable
by
any
means
of
address
which
she
had
spirits
or
time
to
attempt
betsy
too
a
spoilt
child
trained
up

to
report
any
evil

austen
s
abundant
pictures
of
children
are
not

only
ones
to
be
found
in
contemporary
fiction

a
dozen
children
lovely
fresh
gay
and
noisy
the
grand
dispute
who
should
have
oranges
and
who
should
have
almonds
and
raisins
soon
raised
such
a
clamour
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
my
egyptian
friend
the
son
and
heir
reaching
out
his
arm
to
dart
an
apple
across
the
table
at
his
sister
roguishly
intending
to
overset

glass
unluckily
overthrew
his
own
brimful
of

and
of

and
better

family
it
is
observed
as
a
splendid
innovation
that
the
children
are
not
allowed
to
come
into
dessert
to
clamour
and
make
themselves
nuisances
but
are
limited
to
appearing
in
the
later
one
of
the
characters
in
is
made
to
observe
this
is
the
age
of
excess
in
everything
nothing
is
a
gratification
of
which
the
want
has
not
been
previously
felt
the
wishes
of
children
are
all
so
anticipated
that
they
never
experience
the
pleasure
excited
by
wanting
and
he
speaks
also
of
the
too
great
profusion
and
plethora
of
children
s
books
which
is
certainly
not
a
thing
we
are
used
to
attribute
to
that
age
several
of
the
children
s
books
of
that
date
are
kept
alive
to
the
present
day
by
a
salt
of
insight
into
child
nature
and
are
published
and
perennially
many

child
still
knows
and
loves
story
of
the
by
mrs
trimmer
first
brought
out
in
and
as
for
and
by
thomas
day
which
was
at
first
in
three
volumes
published
respectively
in
and
many
a
boy
has
revelled
in
it
not
perhaps
entirely
from
the
point
of
view
in
which
it
was
written
but
with
a
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
in
the
behaviour
of
the
little
prig
harry

and
her
brother
s

many
children
and
miss
edgeworth
s
s
of
which
the
first
volume
appeared
in
is
a
perennial
source
of
amusement
in
nurseries
and
schoolrooms
fairchild
suffers
from
an
excess
of
religiosity
and
a
terrible
belief
in
the
innate
wickedness
of
a
little
child
s
heart
which
is
not
now
tolerated
when
emily
and
lucy
indulge
in
a
childish
quarrel
they
are
taken
to
see
what
remains
of
a
murderer
who
has
hung
on
a
gibbet
until
his
clothes
are
rotting
from
him
and
the
warning
is
enforced
by
a
long
sermon
but
in
spite
of
much
that
would
not
be
suitable
according
to
present
ideas
for
a
child
to
hear
fairchild
the
first
part
of
which
came
out
a
year
subsequently
to
the
death
of
jane
austen
contains
much
that
is
very
human
in
behaviour
and
action
though
later
in
date
than
the
others
mentioned
as
surviving
it
really
is
quite
as
early
in
treatment
as
it
is
a
record
of
what
sherwood
born
in
the
same
year
as
jane
austen
remembered
of
her
own
childhood
the
book
contains
many
examples
of
the
phase
in
contrast
with
which
the
strict
upbringing
of
the
young
fairchilds
is
shown
as
the
better
way
what
sherwood
puts
into
the
mouth
of
fairchild
about
her
childhood
is
probably
autobiographical
and
may
be
quoted
as
an
instance
of
the
sterner
modes
which
were
then
rapidly
passing
out
of
vogue
i
was
but
a
very
little
girl
when
i
came
to
live
with
my
aunts
and
they
kept
me
under
their
care
until
i
was
married
as
far
as
they
knew
what
was
right
they
took
great
pains
with
me
grace
taught
me
to
sew
and
penelope
taught
me
to
read
i
had
a
writing
and
music
master
who
came
from
reading
to
teach
me
twice
a
week
and
i
was
taught
all
kinds
of
household
work
by
my
aunts
maid
we
spent
one
day
exactly
like
another
i
was
made
to
rise
early
and
to
dress
myself
very
neatly
to
breakfast
with
my
aunts
after
breakfast
i
worked
two
hours
with
my
aunt
grace
and
read
an
hour
with
my
aunt
penelope
we
then
if
it
was
fine
weather
took
a
walk
or
if
not
an
airing
in
the
coach
i
and
my
aunts
and
little
shock
the
together
at
dinner
i
was
not
allowed
to
speak
and
after
dinner
i
attended
my
masters
or
learned
my
tasks
the
only
time
i
had
to
play
was
while
my
aunts
were
dressing
to
go
out
for
they
went
out
every
evening
to
play
at
cards
when
they
went
out
my
supper
was
given
to
me
and
i
was
put
to
bed
in
a
closet
in
my
aunts
a
modern
child
under
such
treatment
would
probably
develop
an
acute
form
of
melancholia
the
home
education
of
the
time
for
girls
at
least
was
very
superficial
we
gather
something
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
taught
from
the
remarks
of
the
bertram
girls
in
when
they
plume
themselves
on
their
superiority
to
dear
mamma
only
think
my
cousin
can
not
put
the
map
of
europe
my
cousin
can
not
tell
the
principal
rivers
in
russia
or
she
never
heard
of
asia
minor
or
she
does
not
know
the
differences
between
water
colours
and
crayons
how
strange
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
stupid
my
dear
their
considerate
aunt
would
reply
it
is
very
bad
but
you
must
not
expect
everybody
to
be
as
forward
and
quick
at
learning
as
but
aunt
she
is
really
so
very
ignorant
do
you
know
we
asked
her
last
night
which
way
she
would
go
to
get
to
ireland
and
she
said
she
should
cross
to
the
isle
of
wight
i
can
not
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
know
a
great
deal
that
she
has
not
the
least
notion
of
yet
how
long
ago
is
it
aunt
since
we
used
to
repeat
the
chronological
order
of
the
kings
of
england
with
the
dates
of
their
accession
and
most
of
the
principal
events
of
their
reigns
yes
added
the
other
and
of
the
roman
emperors
as
low
as
severus
besides
a
great
deal
of
the
heathen
mythology
and
all
the
metals
planets
and
distinguished
the
miss
amelia
in
thus
gives
an
account
of
her
education
i
have
gone
on
with
my
french
and
italian
of
course
and
i
am
beginning
german
then
comes
my
he
teaches
me
to
paint
flowers
and
shells
and
to
draw
ruins
and
buildings
and
to
take
views
i
learn
varnishing
gilding
and
japanning
and
next
winter
i
shall
learn
modelling
and
etching
and
engraving
in
mezzotint
and
aquatinta
then
i
have
a
who
teaches
me
the
scotch
and
irish
steps
and
another
who
teaches
me
attitudes
and
i
shall
soon
learn
to
waltz
then
i
have
a
and
another
who
teaches
me
the
harp
and
another
for
the
pianoforte
and
what
little
time
i
can
spare
from
these
principal
things
i
give
by
odd
minutes
to
ancient
and
modern
history
and
geography
and
astronomy
and
grammar
and
botany
and
i
attend
lectures
on
chemistry
and
experimental
jane
s
early
childhood
was
probably
a
very
happy
one
what
with
the
companionship
of
cassandra
with
the
liveliness
and
constant
comings
and
goings
of
the
brothers
who
were
educated
at
home
by
austen
himself
with
all
the
romps
of
a
large
family
having
unlimited
country
as
a
playground
it
can
hardly
have
failed
to
be
so
while
she
was
still
too
young
to
profit
much
by
school
teaching
on
her
own
account
she
was
sent
to
a
school
at
reading
kept
by
a
latournelle
because
cassandra
was
going
and
the
two
sisters
could
not
bear
to
be
parted
how
long
she
was
at
this
school
i
do
not
know
but
the
subjects
taught
were
probably
those
scheduled
in
the
comprehensive
summary
of
smatterings
given
by
the
two
miss
bertrams
this
school
was
a
notable
one
and
among
the
later
pupils
was
sherwood
who
followed
jane
after
an
interval
of
nine
years
she
probably
went
to
school
as
late
as
jane
went
early
which
would
account
for
the
gap
in
time
between
two
who
should
have
been
contemporary
miss
mitford
was
also
a
pupil
she
went
in
when
the
school
had
been
removed
to
hans
place
london
she
gives
a
lively
account
of
it
it
was
kept
by
quintin
a
and
french
emigrant
who
was
assisted
or
rather
chaperoned
in
his
undertaking
by
his
wife
a
frenchwoman
much
muffled
up
in
shawls
and
laces
and
by
miss
rowden
an
accomplished
young
lady
the
daughter
and
sister
of
clergymen
who
had
been
for
some
years
governess
in
the
family
of
lord
bessborough
quintin
himself
taught
the
pupils
french
history
geography
and
as
much
science
as
he
was
master
of
or
as
he
thought
it
requisite
for
a
young
lady
to
know
miss
rowden
with
the
assistance
of
finishing
masters
for
italian
music
dancing
and
drawing
superintended
the
general
course
of
study
while
madame
quintin
sat
dozing
either
in
the
with
a
piece
of
work
or
in
the
library
with
a
book
in
her
hand
to
receive
the
friends
of
the
young
ladies
or
any
other
visitors
who
might
chance
to
miss
mitford
says
further
that
the
school
was
excellent
that
the
pupils
were
healthy
happy
and
kindly
treated
and
that
the
intelligent
manner
in
which
instruction
was
given
had
the
effect
of
producing
in
the
majority
of
the
pupils
a
love
of
reading
and
a
taste
for
of
course
jane
being
such
a
child
when
she
went
can
hardly
have
taken
full
use
of
the
opportunities
which
were
afforded
her
but
perhaps
she
laid
at
school
the
foundations
of
that
cleverness
in
neat
sewing
and
embroidery
which
is
manifested
in
the
specimens
still
in
the
possession
of
her
relatives
there
is
a
portrait
of
jane
painted
when
she
was
about
fifteen
it
shows
a
bright
child
with
shining
eyes
and
one
loose
lock
of
hair
falling
over
her
forehead
not
particularly
pretty
but
intelligent
and
with
character
she
is
standing
and
is
dressed
in
the
simple
white
gown
high
waist
short
sleeves
and
low
neck
which
little
girls
wore
as
well
as
their
elders
and
round
her
neck
is
a
large
locket
slung
on
a
slender
chain
her
portrait
was
painted
by
zoffany
when
she
was
about
fifteen
on
her
first
visit
to
bath
but
whether
this
reproduction
which
appears
in
the
beginning
of
lord
brabourne
s
of
jane
is
from
that
picture
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
says
of
in
childhood
every
available
opportunity
of
instruction
was
made
use
of
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
time
she
was
though
not
highly
accomplished
and
she
certainly
enjoyed
that
important
element
of
mental
training
associating
at
home
with
persons
of
cultivated
he
says
in
another
place
jane
herself
was
fond
of
music
and
had
a
sweet
voice
both
in
singing
and
conversation
in
her
youth
she
had
received
some
instruction
on
the
pianoforte
she
read
french
with
facility
and
knew
something
of
in
french
she
had
at
one
time
a
great
advantage
in
the
continual
association
with
madame
de
feuillade
her
cousin
and
afterwards
her
who
as
already
mentioned
had
been
married
to
a
frenchman
the
illustration
on
is
a
portrait
group
of
the
children
of
the
hon
john
douglas
of
the
morton
family
it
was
painted
by
hoppner
who
lived
and
in
the
costumes
of
the
little
boy
and
elder
girl
especially
gives
a
good
notion
of
the
dress
of
the
children
of
the
period
chapter
iii
the
position
of
the
clergy
jane
austen
was
a
clergyman
s
daughter
at
the
present
time
there
are
undoubtedly
wide
differences
in
the
social
standing
of
the
clergy
according
to
their
own
birth
and
breeding
but
yet
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
a
clergyman
is
considered
a
fit
guest
for
any
man
s
table
it
was
not
always
so
there
was
a
time
when
a
clergyman
was
a
kind
of
servant
ranking
with
the
butler
whose
hospitality
he
enjoyed
we
have
plenty
of
pictures
of
this
state
of
affairs
in
vicar
of
to
go
no
further
but
before
jane
was
born
matters
had
changed
the
pendulum
had
not
yet
swung
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
our
own
day
when
the
fact
of
a
man
s
being
ordained
is
supposed
to
give
him
new
birth
in
a
social
sense
and
a
tailor
s
son
passes
through
the
meagrest
of
the
universities
in
order
that
he
may
thus
be
transformed
into
a
gentleman
without
ever
considering
whether
he
has
the
smallest
vocation
for
the
ministry
in
the
austens
time
the
status
of
a
clergyman
depended
a
very
great
deal
on
himself
and
as
the
patronage
of
the
church
was
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
the
who
bestowed
the
livings
on
their
younger
sons
or
brothers
there
was
very
frequently
a
tie
of
relationship
between
the
vicarage
and
the
great
house
which
was
sufficient
to
ensure
the
vicar
s
position
in
the
case
of
relationship
the
system
was
probably
at
its
best
obviating
any
inducement
to
servility
but
there
was
a
very
evil
side
to
what
may
be
called
local
patronage
which
was
much
more
in
evidence
than
it
is
in
our
time
archbishop
secker
in
his
charges
to
the
clergy
of
the
diocese
of
oxford
when
he
was
their
bishop
in
throws
a
very
clear
light
on
this
side
of
the
question
he
expressly
enjoins
incumbents
to
make
no
promise
to
their
patrons
to
quit
the
benefice
when
desired
before
entering
into
office
the
true
meaning
therefore
is
to
commonly
enslave
the
incumbent
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
the
motive
for
demanding
such
a
promise
was
generally
that
the
living
might
be
held
until
such
time
as
some
raw
young
lad
a
nephew
or
younger
son
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
was
ready
to
take
it
the
evils
of
such
a
system
are
but
too
apparent
we
can
imagine
a
nervous
clergyman
who
would
never
dare
to
express
an
opinion
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
benefactor
who
had
the
power
to
turn
him
out
into
the
world
penniless
we
can
imagine
the
courting
his
patron
with
honied
words
this
debased
type
is
inimitably
sketched
in
the
character
of
collins
in
and
it
shall
be
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
ladyship
and
be
very
ready
to
perform
those
rites
and
ceremonies
which
are
instituted
by
the
church
of
lady
catherine
he
said
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
approve
of
both
the
discourses
which
he
had
already
had
the
honour
of
preaching
she
had
also
asked
him
twice
to
dine
at
rosings
and
had
sent
for
him
only
the
saturday
before
to
make
up
her
pool
of
quadrille
in
the
evening
lady
catherine
was
reckoned
proud
he
knew
by
many
people
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
affability
in
her
she
had
always
spoken
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman
she
made
not
the
smallest
objection
to
his
joining
in
the
society
of
the
in
his
delightful
exordium
to
elizabeth
as
to
his
reasons
for
proposing
to
her
he
my
reasons
for
marrying
are
first
that
i
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
like
myself
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
secondly
that
i
am
convinced
it
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
and
thirdly
which
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
earlier
that
it
is
the
particular
advice
and
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
calling
patroness
twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
unasked
too
on
this
subject
and
it
was
but
the
very
saturday
night
before
i
left
our
pools
at
quadrille
while
jenkinson
was
arranging
miss
de
bourgh
s
she
said
mr
collins
you
must
marry
a
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
choose
properly
choose
a
gentlewoman
for
my
sake
and
for
your
own
let
her
be
an
active
useful
sort
of
person
not
brought
up
high
but
able
to

at

of
the
eighteenth
century
the
church
was
at
its
deadest
enthusiasm
there
was
none
torpid
is
the
only
word
that
fitly
describes
the
spiritual
condition
of
the
majority
of
the
clergy
secker
says
an
open
and
professed
disregard
of
religion
is
become
through
a
variety
of
unhappy
causes
the
distinguishing
character
of
the
present
age
and
the
clergy
as
the
salt
of
the
earth
had
certainly
lost
their
savour
and
did
little
or
nothing
to
resist
an
apathy
which
too
commonly
extended
to
themselves
the
duties
of
clergymen
were
therefore
almost
as
light
as
they
chose
to
make
them
one
service
on
sunday
and
the
holy
communion
three
times
yearly
at
christmas
easter
and
whitsuntide
was
considered
enough
a
sacrament
might
easily
be
interposed
in
the
long
interval
between
christmas
and
whitsuntide
and
the
usual
season
for
it
the
feast
of
michael
is
a
very
proper
time
and
if
afterwards
you
can
advance
from
a
quarterly
communion
to
a
monthly
one
i
make
no
doubt
you
secker
baptisms
marriages
and
funerals
were
looked
on
as
nuisances
the
clergyman
ran
them
together
as
much
as
possible
and
often
arrived
at
the
last
minute
flinging
himself
off
his
smoking
horse
to
gabble
through
the
service
with
the
greatest
possible
speed
children
were
frequently
buried
without
any
service
at
all
the
churches
were
for
the
most
part
damp
and
mouldy
there
were
of
course
none
of
the
present
conveniences
for
heating
and
lighting
heavy
galleries
cut
off
the
little
light
that
struggled
through
the
cobwebby
windows
there
were
hassocks
curtains
on
rods
thick
with
dust
a
general
smell
of
mouldiness
and
disuse
and
a
cold
but
atmosphere
in
some
old
country
churches
there
still
survive
the
family
pews
which
were
like
small
rooms
and
in
which
the
occupants
could
read
or
sleep
without
being
seen
by
anyone
in
one
or
two
cases
there
are
in
these
and
in
one
strange
example
at
langley
in
bucks
the
pew
is
not
only
roofed
in
but
it
has
a
lattice
in
front
with
painted
panels
which
can
be
opened
and
shut
at
the
occupants
pleasure
and
there
is
a
room
in
connection
with
it
in
which
is
a
library
of
books
so
that
it
would
be
quite
possible
for
anyone
to
retire
for
a
little
interlude
without
the
rest
of
the
congregation
s
being
aware
of
it
the
church
only
opened
as
a
rule
once
a
week
was
left
for
the
rest
of
the
time
to
the
bats
and
birds
compare
this
with
one
of
the
neat
warm
clean
churches
to
be
found
almost
everywhere
at
present
churches
with
polished
wood
pews
shining
brass
fittings
tessellated
floor
in
place
of
uneven
bricks
a
communion
table
covered
by
a
cloth

by
the
vicar

wife
and
bearing
white
flowers
placed
by
loving
hands
a
pulpit
of
carved
oak
alabaster
or
marble
instead
of
a
dilapidated
old
in
which
the
parish
clerk
sat
below
and
gave
out
the
tunes
in
a
droning
voice
organs
were
of
course
very
uncommon
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
country
parishes
and
though
there
might
be
at
times
a
little
local
music
as
an
accompaniment
the
hymns
were
generally
drawled
out
without
music

all

idea
of
church
in
i
have
always
gone
now
and
then
though
of
late
years
rarely
as
it
was
most
unpleasant
to
crawl
through
a
churchyard
full
of
staring
footmen
and
apprentices
clamber
a
ladder
to
a
hard
pew
to
hear
the
dullest
of
all
things
a
sermon
and
croaking
and
squalling
of
psalms
to
a
hand
organ
by
brewers
and
charity
the
sermons
were
peculiarly
dry
and
dull
and
it
would
have
taken
a
clever
man
to
suck
any
spiritual
nourishment
therefrom
they
were
generally
on
points
of
doctrine
read
without
modulation
and
if
as
was
frequently
the
case
the
clergyman
had
not
the
energy
to
prepare
his
own
a
sermon
from
any
dreary
collection
sufficed
the
black
gown

doctrine
and
whose
life

lucid
proof
that
he
is
honest
in
the
sacred
cause

guilty
men

mount
the
rostrum

down

up
their
work

dismal
account

is
taken

there
were
many
exceptions
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
for
instance
that
the
rev
george
austen
marred
his
services
by
slovenliness
or
indifference
though
no
doubt
the
most
earnest
man
would
find
it
hard
to
struggle
against
the
disadvantages
of
his
time

have
been

pleasanter

we
gain
an
idea
of
a
man
of
a
genial
pleasant
disposition
cultured
enough
and
fond
of
the
classics
who
kept
his
house
and

well
ordered
who
enjoyed
a
tour
throughout
england
in
company
with
his
wife
who
thoroughly
appreciated
the
lines
in
which
his
lot
was
cast

who
looked
upon
the
living

made
for
him
and
not

the
parishioners
a
writer
in
the
some
years
ago
gives
a
series
of
pleasant
little
of
typical
clergymen
of
this
date
who
can
not
see
it
himself
sauntering
up
and
down
the
grass
on
a
fine
summer
morning
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
black
or
drab
small
clothes
his
feet
encased
in
shoes
his
white
neckcloth
voluminous
and
starchless
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
of
his
powdered
head
his
eye
wandering
about
from
tree
to
flower
and
from
bird
to
bush
as
he
chews
the
cud
of
some
puzzling
construction
in
pindar
or
casts
and
recasts
some
favourite
passage
in
his
translation
of
there
was
the
who
in
the
time
not
devoted
to
sport
was
always
welcome
to
the
cottager
s
wife
at
that
hour
in
the
afternoon
when
she
had
made
herself
tidy
swept
up
the
hearth
and
was
sitting
down
before
the
fire
with
the
stockings
of
the
family
before
her
he
would
chat
with
her
about
the
news
of
the
village
give
her
a
friendly
hint
about
her
husband
s
absence
from
church
and
perhaps
before
going
would
be
taken
out
to
look
at
the
or
the
pleasant
genial
old
gentleman
in
and
sometimes
who
fed
his
poultry
and
went
into
the
stable
to
scratch
the
ears
of
his
favourite
cob
and
round
by
the
to
the
kitchen
garden
where
he
took
a
turn
for
an
hour
or
two
with
his
spade
or
his
pruning
knife
or
sauntered
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
the
direction
of
the
cucumbers
coming
in
to
an
early
austen
seems
to
have
been
a
mixture
of
the
first
and
third
of
these
types
for
he
was
certainly
a
good
scholar
and
yet
some
of
his
chief
interests
in
life
were
connected
with
his
pigs
and
his
sheep
but
though
these
are
charming
sketches
and
their
counterparts
were
doubtless
to
be
found
we
fear
they
are
too
much
idealised
to
be
a
true
representation
of
the
generality
of
the
clergy
of
that
time
and
charming
as
they
are
there
is
an
easy
freedom
from
the
responsibility
of
office
which
is
strange
to
modern
ideas

many
of
which
are
bad

were

almost
a
necessity
gilbert
white
the
naturalist
was
a
shining
light
among
clergymen
he
was
vicar
of
selborne
in
hampshire
until
his
death
in
but
while
he
was
curate
of
durley
near
bishop

waltham
the
actual
expenses
of
the
duty
exceeded
the
receipts
by
nearly
twenty
pounds
in
the
one
year
he
was
there
to
reside
at
all
was
a
great
thing
for
a
clergyman
to
do
and
we
may
be
sure
from
what
we
gather
that
the
rev
george
austen
had
this
virtue
for
he
resided
all
the
time
at
steventon
but
though
the
clergy
frequently
left
all
the
work
to
their
curates
they
always
took
care
to
receive
the
tithes
themselves

engraved

he

distant

a

about
fifty

the
incumbent
about
sixty
years
of
age
is
intoxicated
about
six
times
a
week
and
very
frequently
is
prevented
from
preaching

black

in
this
neighbourhood
thirteen
adjoining

without
so
much
as
even
a

clergyman
had
resided
in
the
parish
for
forty
years
one
rode
over
three
miles
from
wells
to
preach
once
on
a
sunday
but
no
weekly
duty
was
done
or
sick
persons
visited
and
children
were
often
buried
without
any
funeral
service
eight
people
in
the
morning
and
twenty
in
the
afternoon
was
a
good
she
evidently
means
that
the
service
was
sometimes
held
in
the
morning
and
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
as
she
says
there
were
not
two
services
she
also
speaks
of
it
as
an
exceptionally
disinterested
action
of
kennicott
that
he
had
resigned
a
valuable
living
because
his
learned
work
would
not
allow
him
to
reside
in
the
parish
by
far
the
best
account
of
what
was
expected
from
a
contemporary
clergyman
is
to
be
gathered
from
jane
austen
s
own
books
it
is
one
of
her
strong
points
that
she
wrote
only
of
what
she
knew
and
as
her
own
father
and
two
of
her
brothers
were
clergymen
we
can
not
suppose
that
she
was
otherwise
than
favourably
inclined
to
the
class
her
sketch
of
collins
is
no
doubt
something
of
a
caricature
but
it
serves
to
illustrate
very
forcibly
one
great
error
in
the
system
then
in
of
local
patronage
the
other
clergymen
in
her
books
are
numerous
we
have
elton
in
edmund
bertram
and
grant
in
henry
tilney
in
and
edward
ferrars
in
and
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
edmund
bertram
is
a
prig
or
perhaps
to
put
it
more
mildly
is
inclined
to
be
sententious
so
sometimes
one
almost
sympathises
with
the
gay
miss
crawford
whose
ideas
so
shocked
him
and
fanny
yet
though
those
ideas
only
reflected
the
current
opinion
of
the
times
they
were
reprehensible
enough
when
miss
crawford
discovers
to
her
chagrin
that
edmund
whom
she
is
inclined
to
like
more
than
a
little
is
going
to
be
a
clergyman
she
but
why
are
you
to
be
a
clergyman
i
thought
that
was
always
the
lot
of
the
youngest
where
there
were
many
to
choose
before
him
do
you
think
the
church
itself
never
chosen
then
never
is
a
black
word
but
yes
in
the
never
of
conversation
which
means
not
very
often
i
do
think
it
for
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
church
men
love
to
distinguish
themselves
and
in
either
of
the
other
lines
distinction
may
be
gained
but
not
in
the
church
a
clergyman
is
and
in
reply
to
edmund
s
defence
she
you
assign
greater
consequence
to
a
clergyman
than
one
has
been
used
to
hear
given
or
than
i
can
quite
comprehend
one
does
not
see
much
of
this
influence
and
importance
in
society
and
how
can
it
be
acquired
where
they
are
so
seldom
seen
themselves
how
can
two
sermons
a
week
even
supposing
them
worth
hearing
supposing
the
preacher
to
have
the
sense
to
prefer
blair
s
to
his
own
do
all
that
you
speak
of
govern
the
conduct
and
fashion
and
manners
of
a
large
congregation
for
the
rest
of
the
week
one
scarcely
sees
a
clergyman
out
of
his
pulpit
you
are
speaking
of
london
i
am
speaking
of
the
nation
at
but
it
is
noteworthy
that
even
edmund
who
is
upheld
as
a
bright
example
does
not
in
his
defence
assert
anything
relative
to
the
careful
looking
after
the
lives
of
his
flock
which
nowadays
is
a
chief
part
of
a
parish
clergyman
s
duty
he
speaks
of
conduct
and
declares
that
as
the
clergy
are
or
are
not
what
they
ought
to
be
so
are
the
rest
of
the
nation
but
all
the
retort
he
wins
from
the
girl
he
so
much
admires
is
that
she
is
just
as
much
surprised
at
his
choice
as
ever
and
that
he
really
is
fit
for
something
better
in
another
place
where
the
same
discussion
is
reopened
she
says
it
is
indolence
bertram
and
love
of
want
of
all
laudable
ambition
of
taste
for
good
company
or
of
inclination
to
take
the
trouble
of
being
agreeable
which
make
men
clergymen
a
clergyman
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
be

seven
hundred
a

a

for
a

and
as
of
course
he
will
still
live
at

it
will
be
all
for
his
and
a

at

and
easter
i
suppose
will
be
the
sum
total
of
after
all
this
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
some
upright
and
serious
men
even
in
those
days
thought
differently
of
the
life
and
duties
of
a
clergyman
for
jane
makes
sir
thomas
bertram
a
parish
has
wants
and
claims
which
can
be
known
only
by
a
clergyman
constantly
resident
and
which
no
proxy
can
be
capable
of
satisfying
to
the
same
extent
edmund
might
in
the
common
phrase
do
the
duty
of
thornton
that
is
he
might
read
prayers
and
preach
without
giving
up
mansfield
park
he
might
ride
over
every
sunday
to
a
house
nominally
inhabited
and
go
through
divine
service
he
might
be
the
clergyman
of
thornton
lacey
every
seventh
day
for
three
or
four
hours
if
that
would
content
him
but
it
will
not
he
knows
that
human
nature
needs
more
lessons
than
a
weekly
sermon
can
convey
and
that
if
he
does
not
live
among
his
parishioners
and
prove
himself
by
constant
attention
to
be
their
and
friend
he
does
very
little
either
for
their
good
or
his
it
is
also
striking
to
see
how
very
much
the
taking
of
orders
depended
upon
some
living
to
be
obtained
there
seems
to
have
been
no
special
idea
of
suitability
and
still
less
of
preparation
only
the
merest
and
most
perfunctory
examination
was
demanded
of
the
candidate
for
orders
there
is
a
story
of
this
date
of
one
examination
for
ordination
where
only
two
questions
were
asked
one
of
which
was
what
is
the
hebrew
for
a
skull
in
an
entertaining
book
on
jane
austen
by
miss
constance
hill
published
in
there
is
a
quotation
from
a
letter
anent
the
ordination
examination
of
lefroy
who
married
anna
jane
s
niece
the
bishop
only
asked
him
two
questions
first
if
he
was
the
son
of
lefroy
of
ashe
and
secondly
if
he
had
married
a
miss
it
is
said
also
that
brownlow
north
bishop
of
winchester
examined
his
candidates
for
ordination
in
a
during
a
match
one
candidate
is
described
by
boswell
as
having
read
no
books
of
divinity
not
even
the
greek
testament
there
were
of
course
serious
and
learned
bishops
enough
burnet
bishop
of
salisbury
who
lived
from
to
was
horrified
at
the
ignorance
of
candidates
who
apparently
had
never
read
the
old
testament
and
hardly
knew
what
was
in
the
new
they
cry
and
think
it
a
sad
disgrace
to
be
denied
orders
though
the
ignorance
of
some
is
such
that
in
a
state
of
things
they
would
appear
not
to
know
enough
to
be
admitted
to
the
holy
it
is
probable
that
the
bishops
judged
a
great
deal
more
on
the
whole
by
the
appearance
and
manners
of
the
man
before
them
and
the
prospects
he
had
of
holding
a
living
than
by
his
own
knowledge
and
in
the
case
of
a
man
like
edmund
bertram
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
about
his
lack
of
divinity
of
henry
tilney
s
duties
in
very
little
can
be
said
or
gathered
he
never
appears
like
a
clergyman
at
all
we
are
told
that
the
parsonage
was
a
new
built
substantial
stone
we
know
that
he
had
to
go
there
much
to
catherine
morland
s
distress
when
she
was
a
guest
at
his
father
s
house
northanger
abbey
because
the
engagements
of
his
curate
at
woodston
obliged
him
to
leave
on
saturday
for
a
couple
of
nights
but
at
all
events
he
does
seem
to
have
spent
most
of
his
time
at
the
parsonage
though
he
still
kept
on
his
room
at
home
of
edward
ferrars
clerical
avocations
we
also
hear
so
very
little
that
he
might
almost
as
well
have
been
of
any
other
profession
the
only
other
clergyman
in
the
novels
is
elton
a
specimen
not
quite
so
egregious
as
collins

be
very
amusing

like
elton
papa
i
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him
there
is
nobody
in
highbury
who
deserves
him
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
and
i
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
he
looked
so
very
much
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
the
same
kind

done
for
him

of
the
social
status
of
the

would
not
have
been
thought
entirely
out
of
the
question
for
the

though
doubtless
a
little
beneath
her

is
represented
as
a
handsome
ingratiating

who
spends
his
time
playing
the
gallant

making
charades
with
the
young
ladies
and
preaching
sermons
that
please
everybody
however
he
meets
his

in

dashing
and
vulgar

he
picks
up
soon
after

chapter
iv
home
life
at
steventon
for
the
first
years
of
her
life
from
her
birth
in
december
to
the
spring
of
jane
lived
at
steventon
in
her
father
s
rectory
as
peaceful
and
quiet
a
home
as
even
she
could
have
wished
but
though
her
own
circumstances
were
peaceful
and
happy
the
great
world
without
was
full
of
flux
and
reflux
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
revolutions
and
upheavals
which
changed
the
whole
face
of
europe
were
going
on
year
by
year
but
of
these
things
as
i
have
said
hardly
an
echo
reaches
us
in
her
writing
not
even
in
the
correspondence
with
her
sister
which
begins
in
when
the
turmoil
was
at
its
height
which
is
the
more
surprising
when
we
consider
that
her
own
sailor
brothers
were
taking
an
active
part
in
affairs
and
her
cousin
the
countess
de
feuillade
had
fled
to
the
austens
for
shelter
when
her
husband
suffered
death
by
the
guillotine
what
depths
these
things
stirred
in
jane
or
whether
she
lacked
the
imagination
to
bring
home
to
her
their
enormous
importance
relative
to
the
small
details
of
immediate
surroundings
we
shall
never
know
her
minute
observation
her
unrivalled
faculty
for
using
that
which
lay
under
her
hand
the
stores
of
little
human
characteristics
which
by
her
transmuting
touch
she
invested
with
such
intense
interest
lead
one
to
suppose
that
such
a
clear
mental
vision
carried
with
it
defective
mental
long
sight
there
are
a
number
of
persons
who
deeply
and
warmly
interested
in
that
which
immediately
appeals
to
them
can
not
throw
their
sympathy
far
out
over
unseen
events
and
persons
we
are
all
prone
to
this
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
is
not
more
affected
by
a
single
tragic
death
in
the
neighbourhood
than
by
the
loss
of
a
hundred
lives
in
america
life
in
this
world
would
be
intolerable
were
it
not
so
this
is
one
of
the
provisions
of
a
merciful
providence
for
making
it
endurable
but
there
are
some
more
in
this
respect
than
others
and
from
internal
evidence
in
the
letters
we
may
judge
that
jane
belonged
to
them
it
is
only
conjecture
but
it
is
often
the
case
in
life
that
virtues
carry
corresponding
faults
that
extreme
cleverness
in
one
direction
induces
a
little
want
of
perception
in
another
the
law
of
balance
and
compensation
is
so
omnipresent
that
jane
s
intensely
clear
vision
in
regard
to
near
objects
may
have
been
paid
for
by
absorption
in
them
somewhat
to
the
exclusion
of
larger
interests
in
while
she
was
yet
but
fourteen
years
old
there
began
that
revolution
which
taking
it
altogether
is
the
most
tremendous
fact
in
the
history
of
europe
france
was
seething
but
as
yet
the
ferment
had
not
affected
other
nations
in
the
july
of
that
year
the
tricolour
was
adopted
as
the
national
flag
excess
reigned
supreme
and
the
nobles
began
to
emigrate
it
was
not
until
that
france
began
to
grasp
the
lands
of
others
and
reached
forth
the
first
of
those
tentacles
which
like
those
of
an
octopus
were
to
spread
all
over
europe
in
the
beginning
austria
and
prussia
opposed
her
but
after
the
murder
of
the
french
king
in
january
england
was
forced
to
join
in
to
protect
holland
and
to
uphold
the
general
status

were
signed

almost
all

echoes
of
the
reign

that
followed

have
reached
even
to
the
remotest
recesses

it
is
impossible
to
believe
that

were
not

for

would
seem
to
palliate

nation
that
has
ever
produced

of
all
their
barbarities
the
most
inhuman
has
been
their
putting
the
poor
wretched
king
and
queen
to
death
three
years
ago
if
thousands
have
been
murdered
tortured

it
has
been
extempore
but
louis
and
his
queen
have
suffered
daily
deaths
in
apprehension
for
themselves
and
their
the
newspapers
gave
long
extracts
from
the
doings
of
the
national
assembly
but
of
course
these
always
appeared
some
days
subsequently
to
the
events
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
french
king
was
known
by
rumour
at
least
with
extraordinary
quickness
about
two
days
after
it
happened
and
was
received
with
execration
detailed
accounts
did
not
come
in
until
some
days
after
the
first
notice
is
thus
announced
in
the
james
s
the
murder
took
place
at
four
in
the
morning
on
monday
and
was
conducted
in
the
most
private
manner
the
guillotine
was
erected
in
a
court
of
the
temple
a
hole
dug
under
it
into
which
the
king
s
head
fell
and
his
body
was
precipitated
this
was
incorrect
in
some
particulars
as
the
murder
did
not
take
place
until
after
ten
in
the
morning
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
time
there
are
little
sentences
that
strike
us
sadly
even
now
and
when
freshly
recorded
as
having
just
happened
they
must
have
moved
many
persons
to
deep
sorrow
july
a
greater
regard
is
shown
for
the
august

quoted
i
did
not
expect
to
appear
before
you
i
always
thought
that
i
should
be
delivered

there
still
are
any
worthy
of
that
in
august
of
the
same
year
the
death
of
marie
antoinette
was
daily
expected
the
queen
was
dressed
in
white
lawn
and
wore
a
black
girdle
her
cell
is
only
eight
feet
long
and
eight
feet
wide
her
couch
consists
of
a
hard
straw
bed
and
very
thin
coverings
her
diet
soup
and
boiled
but
in
an
anguish
of
mind
which
must
have
made
her
indifferent
to
the
horrors
of
material
surroundings
the
poor
queen
was
kept
alive
until
october
when
finally
news
came
of
her
execution
as
soon
as
the
queen
left
the
conciergerie
to
ascend
the
scaffold
the
multitude
cried
out
in
the
midst
of
plaudits
marie
antoinette
had
on
a
white
loose
dress
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
back
she
looked
firmly
round
her
on
all
sides
and
on
the
scaffold
preserved
her
natural
dignity
of
this
is
the
kind
of
reading
of
contemporary
events
that
would
greet
jane
when
the
household
received
its

paper

through

while
the
french

bored
their
way
into
the
continent
of
the
splendid
naval
victories
of
these
years
we
speak
in
the
chapter
on
the
navy
these
surely
must
have
affected
jane
and
made
her
heart
beat
high
at
the
thought
of
what
her
brothers
might
be
called
upon
to
undergo
any
day

spirit
to
the
allies
in
europe
a
whole
string
of
affiliated
republics
had
now
been
established
by
france
made
out
of
her
switzerland
whose
strict
neutrality
had
not
preserved
her
from
invasion
yet
austria
carried
on
her
share
of
the
war
bravely
and
in
the
autumn
of
the
english
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
retrieve
the
integrity
of
holland
but
after
a
short
campaign
were
compelled
to
evacuate
the
country
in
october
napoleon
finding
his
dreams
of
establishing
a
great
eastern
kingdom
impracticable
returned
to
france
and
in
the
december
of
the
same
year
was
acclaimed
first
consul
thus
from
her
early
girlhood
jane
would
hear
of
events
which
greatly
affected
her
own
country
she
would
be
accustomed
to
a
perpetual
state
of
war
she
would
share
in
the
apprehensions
of
invasions
and
the
name
of
napoleon
ever
swelling
into
greater
and
greater
menace
would
continually
strike
upon
her
ear
in
november
jane
makes
one
of
her
few
allusions
to
historical
events
and
then
only
because
it
concerned
her
brother
the
with
the
rest
of
the
egyptian
squadron
was
off
the
isle
of
cyprus
whither
they
went
from
jaffa
for
provisions
and
whence
they
were
to
sail
in
a
day
or
two
for
alexandria
there
to
await
the
result
of
the
english
proposals
for
the
evacuation
of
in
with
buonaparte
at
the
head
of
a
military
despotism
a
new
era
began
in
the
war
the
two
terrific
battles
of
marengo
and
hohenlinden
hotly
contested
left
the
french
victors
and
at
the
latter
seven
thousand
of
the
allies
were
taken
prisoners
and
seven
thousand
killed
and
wounded
in
this
year
at
home
the
most
important
event
was
the
union
of
ireland
with
great
britain
when
the
continental
war
was
going
on
the
news
from
the
field
of
battle
was
generally
eight
or
nine
days
old
but
this
of
course
was
nothing
to
the
time
which
elapsed
in
the
case
of
india
for
events
which
had
happened
there
in
february
were
given
to
the
public
as
news
in
august
then
indeed
to
send
a
boy
to
the
east
was
to
part
with
him
in
reality
there
was
a
long
voyage
round
the
cape
prolonged
indefinitely
by
wind
and
weather
to
encounter
it
would
be
a
year
from
his
setting
out
before
the
news
of
his
arrival
could
reach
his
relations
in
england
it
is
the
enormous
difference
made
by
the
telegraph
that
strikes
us
most
in
the
contemplation
of
this
era
of
course
the
officials
in
india
could
not
get
instructions
from
home
they
were
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
and
the
impossibility
of
being
checked
in
anything
they
wished
to
do
no
doubt
gave
them
that
splendid
decision
which
won
for
us
our
indian
empire
it
was
in
that
the
india
act
introduced
by
pitt
had
given
england
power
over
indian
affairs
in
the
following
year
hastings
had
returned
home
and
his
celebrated
trial
ending
in
his
complete
acquittal
in
must
have
taught
the
english
more
about
indian
matters
than
they
had
ever
known
before
to
attend
the
trial
in
westminster
hall
was
one
of
the
society
diversions
of
the
day
in
in
one
day
the
duchess
of
gordon
went
to
handel
s
music
in
the
abbey
she
then
clambered
over
the
benches
and
went
to
hastings
trial
in
the
hall
after
dinner
to
the
play
then
to
lady
lucan
s
assembly
after
that
to
ranelagh
and
returned
to
hobart
s
faro
table
gave
a
ball
herself
in
the
evening
of
that
morning
into
which
she
must
have
got
a
good
way
and
set
out
for
scotland
the
next
long
before
jane
s
death
the
mighty
empire
of
india
had
passed
almost
completely
under
british
control
but
if
her
lifetime
saw
the
foundation
of
one
empire
it
witnessed
also
the
loss
of
another
country
the
united
states
were
declared
independent
in
the
first
year
of
her
life
and
before
she
was
of
an
age
to
take
any
practical
note
of
politics
they
had
been
recognised
by
france
as
an
independent
nation
she
lived
indeed
in
an
epoch
when
history
was
made
and
she
lived
on
into
a
new
era
of
things
when
buonaparte
was
finally
subdued
france
settled
the
continent
at
peace
at
present
we
have
only
briefly
outlined
the
extraordinary
series
of
events
which
filled
the
years
during
which
she
living
in
her
sheltered
nook
at
steventon
heard
only
echoes
there
is
something
peculiarly
suitable
in
picturing
her
in
this
tranquil
backwater
as
far
as
jane
s
personal
appearance
is
concerned
we
can
gather
some
notion
of
her
though
the
materials
are
slight
the
only
portrait
preserved
of
her
when
grown
up
is
from
a
drawing
by
her
sister
and
represents
a
bright
intelligent
but
not
very
prepossessing
face
with
large
eyes
and
a
straight
nose
there
is
humour
and
decision
in
the
expression
and
in
spite
of
the
quaint
cap
and
the
simple
dress
with
and
tucked
chemisette
which
make
it
look
a
little
odd
to
modern
eyes
there
is
distinct
personality
it
may
be
a
good
likeness
of
her
as
she
was
then
but
on
the
other
hand
one
must
allow
something
for
the
treatment
of
an
amateur
and
we
can
afford
to
think
of
her
as
being
more
attractive
than
she
is
here
represented
a
contemporary
verbal
description
left
of
her
is
that
given
by
sir
egerton
brydges
who
knew
her
personally
he
says
she
was
fair
and
handsome
slight
and
elegant
but
with
cheeks
a
little
too
we
may
well
believe
that
as
to
looks
she
was
in
that
middle
state
of
neither
exceptional
beauty
nor
exceptional
plainness
which
is
certainly
the
happiest
emma
woodhouse
is
supposed
to
have
resembled
her
more
than
any
of
her
other
heroines
and
she
herself
describes
emma
by
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
other
characters
in
the
book
such
an
eye
the
true
hazel
eye
and
so
brilliant
regular
features
open
countenance
with
a
what
a
bloom
of
full
health
and
such
a
pretty
height
and
size
such
a
firm
and
upright
figure
there
is
health
not
merely
in
her
bloom
but
in
her
air
her
head
her
glance
one
sometimes
hears
of
a
child
being
the
picture
of
health
now
emma
always
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
the
complete
picture
of
the
most
exact
personal
description
we
have
of
jane
is
to
be
found
in
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
written
by
her
brother
henry
allowing
for
the
fact
that
this
was
penned
at
a
time
when
the
hearts
of
all
who
knew
her
were
bleeding
for
the
early
death
by
which
she
had
been
taken
from
them
and
that
her
gentle
and
gradual
decline
had
previously
softened
and
toned
down
the
whole
of
that
bright
lively
nature
so
that
any
small
imperfections
had
been
entirely
smoothed
away
we
may
gather
a
good
picture
of
her
from
his
her
stature
was
that
of
true
elegance
it
could
not
have
been
increased
without
exceeding
the
middle
height
her
carriage
and
deportment
were
quiet
yet
graceful
her
features
were
separately
good
their
assemblage
produced
an
unrivalled
expression
of
that
cheerfulness
sensibility
and
benevolence
which
were
her
real
characteristics
her
complexion
was
of
the
finest
texture
her
voice
was
extremely
he
says
also
that
she
excelled
in
conversation
as
much
as
in
composition
she
was
faultless
and
never
commented
with
unkindness
even
on
the
vices
of
others
she
always
sought
in
the
faults
of
others
something
to
excuse
forgive
or
forget
she
never
uttered
a
hasty
a
silly
or
a
severe
he
speaks
further
of
her
good
memory
of
her
fondness
for
landscape
and
her
musical
skill
and
says
that
johnson
was
her
favourite
author
in
prose
cowper
in
verse
yet
though
bright
and
clever
and
animated
by
indisputable
genius
she
was
not
intellectual
the
world
of
ideas
held
no
place
in
her
mind
we
can
see
very
well
from
her
books
that
the
great
fundamental
laws
so
important
to
a
wide
deep
mind
were
entirely
ignored
by
her
she
was
of
the
mental
calibre
of
her
own
elizabeth
bennet
a
bright
intelligent
companion
without
depth
or
brain
force
we
can
not
imagine
her
grasping
abstractions
or
wrestling
with
theories
her
mind
was
formed
for
practicalities
and
facts
illustration
jane
austen
jane
we
know
was
very
healthy
and
full
of
spirits
we
hear
of
no
ailments
beyond
a
weakness
of
the
eyes
from
which
she
certainly
suffered
she
says
my
eyes
have
been
very
indifferent
since
it
the
last
letter
was
written
but
are
now
getting
better
once
more
keeping
them
so
many
hours
open
on
thursday
night
as
well
as
the
dust
of
the
ballroom
injured
them
a
good
deal
i
use
them
as
little
as
i
can
but
you
know
and
everybody
who
has
ever
had
weak
eyes
knows
how
delightful
it
is
to
hurt
them
by
employment
against
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
all
one
s
the
austens
had
special
advantages
in
their
position
in
the
fact
that
they
were
relatives
of
knight
to
whom
the
whole
parish
belonged
austen
seems
to
have
been
referred
to
in
the
absence
of
knight
as
a
kind
of
squire
he
lived
simply
but
had
apparently
enough
money
to
allow
his
daughters
the
privileges
of
gentlewomen
and
they
went
to
all
the
dances
and
balls
in
the
neighbourhood
and
paid
frequent
visits
to
their
brothers
houses
for
weeks
at
a
time
austen
kept
a
carriage
and
pair
though
that
meant
less
than
it
would
do
now
as
private
means
of
conveyance
was
much
more
necessary
and
there
was
no
carriage
tax
to
add
to
the
expense
austen
seems
to
have
been
constantly
ailing
which
threw
the
housekeeping
a
good
deal
into
the
hands
of
her
daughters
it
is
possible
that
her
ailments
were
more
imaginary
than
real
as
she
lived
to
a
great
age
and
in
her
old
age
employed
herself
about
the
garden
and
poultry
and
is
spoken
of
as
being
brisk
and
bright
perhaps
she
grew
more
energetic
as
she
grew
older
a
not
uncommon
process
jane
s
allusions
to
her
mother
s
health
are
frequent
and
sometimes
seem
to
point
to
the
fact
that
she
did
not
altogether
believe
in
now
indeed
we
are
likely
to
have
a
wet
day
and
though
sunday
my
mother
begins
it
without
any
it
began
to
occur
to
me
before
you
mentioned
it
that
i
had
been
somewhat
silent
as
to
my
mother
s
health
for
some
time
but
i
thought
you
could
have
no
difficulty
in
divining
its
exact
who
have
guessed
so
much
stranger
things
she
is
tolerably
well
better
upon
the
whole
than
she
was
some
weeks
ago
she
would
tell
you
herself
that
she
has
a
very
dreadful
cold
in
her
head
at
present
but
i
have
not
much
compassion
for
colds
in
the
head
without
fever
or
sore
my
mother
continues
hearty
her
appetite
and
nights
are
very
good
but
she
sometimes
complains
of
an
asthma
a
dropsy
water
in
her
chest
and
a
liver
for
a
day
or
two
last
week
my
mother
was
very
poorly
with
a
return
of
one
of
her
old
complaints
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
seems
to
have
left
nothing
bad
behind
it
she
began
to
talk
of
a
serious
illness
her
two
last
having
been
preceded
by
the
same
symptoms
but
thank
heaven
she
is
now
quite
as
well
as
one
can
expect
her
to
be
in
the
weather
which
deprives
her
of
in
the
family
memoirs
george
austen
is
always
spoken
of
as
a
person
of
wit
and
imagination
in
whom
might
be
found
the
germs
of
her
daughter
s
genius
such
opinion
based
on
recollections
must
be
deferred
to
but
such
is
not
the
picture
we
gather
from
the
letters
there
austen
seems
to
have
exercised
none
but
the
slightest
influence
on
her
daughters
lives
and
when
they
do
mention
her
it
is
only
to
remark
on
her
health
or
the
care
of
her
in
a
journey
or
that
she
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
choosing
the
furniture
for
the
new
home
in
bath
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
taken
in
conjunction
with
this
that
all
the
mothers
of
jane
s
heroines
when
living
are
described
as
fools
or
worse
it
is
not
intended
to
hint
that
she
drew
such
characters
from
the
home
circle
or
from
her
mother
s
friends
but
it
is
plainly
to
be
seen
that
she
did
not
look
for
or
expect
from
women
of
this
standing
the
wit
and
sense
she
found
elsewhere
indeed
when
one
thinks
of
the
bringing
up
of
women
in
those
days
their
narrowness
of
education
and
extraordinary
ignorance
of
the
world
it
is
wonderful
how
many
did
possess
keen
sense
and
mother
wit
the
most
notable
of
the
examples
in
point
in
the
books
is
bennet
in
and
who
with
her
foolish
indulgence
of
her
younger
children
her
mad
desire
to
get
her
daughters
married
to
anyone
who
could
furnish
a
home
of
whatever
sort
is
the
worst
specimen
of
her
kind
oh
bennet
you
are
wanted
immediately
we
are
all
in
an
uproar
you
must
come
and
make
lizzie
marry
collins
for
she
vows
she
will
not
have
him
and
if
you
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
and
not
have
bennet
s
subsequent
calm
rebuke
in
his
admonition
to
his
daughter
an
unhappy
alternative
is
before
you
elizabeth
from
this
day
you
must
be
a
stranger
to
one
of
your
parents
your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
not
marry
collins
and
i
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
heightens
the
effect
of
his
wife
s
folly
bennet
s
fatuous
selfishness
and
want
of
sense
might
have
been
almost
too
painful
to
cause
amusement
even
in
a
book
had
they
not
been
set
off
by
her
husband
s
sardonic
humour
just
the
touch
that
jane
austen
knew
so
well
how
to
give
but
bennet
is
not
the
only
one
jennings
in
and
is
a
merry
fat
elderly
woman
who
talked
a
great
deal
seemed
very
happy
and
rather
she
is
perpetually
making
the
dashwood
girls
wince
with
her
outspoken
allusions
and
seems
altogether
deficient
in
taste
and
sense
though
extremely
as
for
dashwood
senior
in
the
same
book
in
her
belief
in
the
charming
but
willoughby
she
is
if
possible
one
degree
more
credulous
than
her
most
foolish
daughter
lady
bertram
of
is
kind
enough
to
her
niece
in
her
own
way
but
she
did
not
go
into
public
with
her
daughters
she
was
too
indolent
even
to
accept
a
mother
s
gratification
in
witnessing
their
success
and
enjoyment
at
the
expense
of
any
personal
lady
bertram
did
not
at
all
like
to
have
her
husband
leave
her
but
she
was
not
disturbed
by
any
alarm
for
his
safety
or
solicitude
for
his
comfort
being
one
of
those
persons
who
think
nothing
can
be
dangerous
or
difficult
or
fatiguing
to
anyone
but
musgrove
senior
in
is
nothing
but
a
fool
and
captain
wentworth
should
be
allowed
some
credit
for
the
with
which
he
attended
to
her
large
fat
sighings
over
the
destiny
of
a
son
whom
alive
nobody
had
cared
the
women
without
daughters
such
as
lady
russell
and
croft
in
the
same
book
are
allowed
to
be
sensible
but
a
mother
with
daughters
seems
always
to
be
mercilessly
delineated
by
jane
of
austen
not
much
is
known
he
was
a
quiet
reserved
man
noted
for
his
good
looks
and
clever
enough
to
educate
his
sons
for
the
university
himself
in
his
younger
days
he
took
pupils
and
it
was
one
of
these
pupils
who
in
after
years
became
so
much
attached
to
cassandra
that
he
entered
into
the
engagement
with
her
which
terminated
so
sadly
austen
probably
kept
a
restraining
hand
over
his
large
household
and
was
responsible
for
the
sensible
and
kindly
upbringing
which
his
daughters
received
he
seems
to
have
placed
no
restraint
whatever
on
their
pleasures
as
they
grew
up
it
may
be
noted
that
the
husbands
of
all
the
foolish
women
in
jane
s
books
noted
above
are
sensible
capable
men
as
for
the
surroundings
and
small
details
of
the
home
where
jane
remained
with
her
sister
and
parents
when
the
brothers
went
out
into
the
world
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
an
adequate
picture
there
was
a
great
simplicity
and
an
absence
of
many
things
which
are
now
turned
out
in
profusion
by
machinery
but
were
then
not
known
we
have
all
of
us
been
in
old
houses
of
the
simpler
kind
and
noted
the
severity
of
uncorniced
walls
the
smallness
of
the
inconvenient
the
plainness
of
the
whole
aspect
to
the
furniture
also
the
same
remarks
would
apply
there
would
be
fewer
things
and
of
a
more
solid
kind
perhaps
we
should
be
most
struck
with
the
total
absence
of
those
elegant
little
articles
which
now
embellish
and
encumber
our
tables
we
should
miss
the
sliding
bookcases
and
picture
stands
the
letter
weighing
machines
and
envelope
cases
the
periodicals
and
illustrated
all
the
countless
swarm
of
photograph
books
which
now
threaten
to
swallow
up
all
in
the
by
the
following
quotation
from
jane
herself
before
the
removal
to
bath
what
a
vision
is
instantly
conjured
up
of
the
yellow
speckled
prints
in
cheap
varnished
frames
the
crude
colours
and
stereotyped
subjects
of
those
old
pictures
which
still
occasionally
remain
in
the
spare
rooms
of
country
as
to
our
pictures
the
battle
piece
nibbs
sir
william
east
and
all
the
old
heterogeneous
miscellany
manuscript
scriptural
pieces
dispersed
over
the
house
are
to
be
given
to
james
your
own
drawings
will
not
cease
to
be
your
own
and
the
two
paintings
on
tin
will
be
at
your
disposal
my
mother
says
that
the
french
agricultural
prints
in
the
best
bedroom
were
given
by
edward
to
his
two
in
regard
to
minor
matters
of
domestic
comfort
lucifer
matches
were
not
in
general
use
until
though
the
fact
that
they
were
anticipated
by
some
genius
in
advance
of
his
time
is
evidenced
by
this
advertisement
in
the
of
for
travellers
mariners
promethean
fire
and
phosphorus
g
watts
respectfully
acquaints
the
public
that
he
has
prepared
a
large
variety
of
machines
of
a
portable
and
durable
kind
with
promethean
fire
paper
and
match
enclosed
most
admirably
calculated
to
prevent
those
disagreeable
sensations
which
most
frequently
arise
in
the
dreary
hour
of
midnight
from
sudden
alarm
thieves
fire
or
considering
this
it
is
probable
that
some
sort
of
sulphur
match
was
in
use
before
though
the
general
method
would
be
the
tedious
flint
and
steel
for
firing
wood
was
of
course
largely
used
the
cottagers
depended
totally
on
pilfering
breaking
hedges
and
cutting
coal
was
very
expensive
being
of
course
mined
with
difficulty
in
the
days
here
is
a
contemporary
account
of
a
visit
to
a
in
yorkshire
we
had
the
curiosity
to
walk
and
take
a
near
outside
view
of
one
seventy
yards
deep
the
manner
they
work
them
is
strange
and
not
a
little
dangerous
as
they
are
obliged
to
have
candles
and
sometimes
with
a
roof
so
low
that
men
dig
on
their
knees
they
have
two
boxes
which
are
alternately
pulled
up
and
down
by
pullies
worked
by
a
horse
which
goes
round
and
round
in
a
sort
of
added
to
the
expense
of
mining
was
the
expense
of
carriage
which
in
the
days
before
railways
had
to
be
done
by
canal
or
sea
and
the
term
so
frequently
used
in
the
literature
of
the
day
refers
to
this
coal
sometimes
after
a
storm
the
vessels
were
delayed
so
that
the
scarcity
of
coal
ran
up
the
price
enormously
this
is
a
brief
sketch
of
the
details
at
the
rectory
in
such
a
home
there
was
plenty
of
occupation
for
a
bright
spirit
like
jane
s
and
we
can
hardly
imagine
her
ever
to
have
been
idle
when
her
sister
was
away
she
undertook
the
housekeeping
and
writes
my
mother
desires
me
to
tell
you
that
i
am
a
good
housekeeper
which
i
have
no
reluctance
in
doing
because
i
really
think
it
my
peculiar
excellence
and
for
this
always
take
care
to
provide
such
things
as
please
my
own
appetite
which
i
consider
as
the
chief
merit
in
housekeeping
i
have
had
some
ragout
veal
and
i
mean
to
have
some
haricot
mutton
we
are
to
kill
a
pig
i
am
very
fond
of
experimental
housekeeping
such
as
having
an
now
and
then
i
shall
have
one
next
week
and
i
mean
to
have
some
little
dumplings
put
into
at
another
time
speaking
of
the
family
doctor
she
i
was
not
ashamed
of
asking
him
to
sit
down
to
table
for
we
had
some
a
sparerib
and
a
dinner
at
that
date
was
for
the
unfashionable
at
the
hour
of
three
and
for
the
fashionable
not
earlier
than
five
and
sometimes
much
later
lady
newdigate
cheverels
of
cheverel
says
the
hours
of
the
family
are
what
the
polite
world
would
not
conform
to
breakfast
at
half
past
eight
dine
at
half
past
three
supper
at
nine
and
go
to
bed
at
jane
austen
in
her
home
life
was
not
in
a
fashionable
set
and
her
people
did
not
ape
the
manners
of
society
she
writes
at
another
time
we
dine
now
at
half
past
three
and
have
done
dinner
i
suppose
before
you
begin
we
drink
tea
at
half
past
when
she
went
to
stay
at
godmersham
which
she
frequently
did
she
mingled
with
county
people
and
noted
their
manners
and
ways
but
she
was
entirely
free
from
snobbishness
and
her
quiet
satire
of
those
who
imitated
all
the
superficial
details
in
the
life
of
a
higher
class
than
their
own
is
seen
in
her
account
of
tom
musgrave
in
who
condescends
to
stay
and
play
cards
with
the
watsons
until
nine
when
the
carriage
was
ordered
to
the
door
and
no
entreaties
for
his
staying
longer
could
now
avail
for
he
well
knew
that
if
he
stayed
he
would
have
to
sit
down
to
supper
in
less
than
ten
minutes
which
to
a
man
whose
heart
had
long
been
fixed
on
calling
his
next
meal
a
dinner
was
quite
it
is
not
difficult
to
trace
the
evolution
of
the
in
the
time
of
pepys
busy
men
rose
early
and
took
hardly
any
breakfast
perhaps
a
glass
of
wine
or
a
draught
of
ale
with
a
bit
of
bread
grosley
a
frenchman
who
visited
england
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
says
that
the
butter
and
tea
which
the
londoners
live
upon
from
the
morning
till
three
or
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
occasion
the
chief
consumption
of
bread
which
is
cut
in
slices
and
so
thin
that
it
does
as
much
honour
to
the
address
of
the
person
who
cuts
it
as
to
the
sharpness
of
the
knife
two
or
three
of
these
slices
furnish
out
a
after
this
slight
repast
corresponding
to
the
continental
coffee
and
roll
men
worked
hard
until
a
meal
that
occupied
several
hours
and
at
which
they
consumed
an
enormous
amount
and
they
did
little
or
no
work
afterwards
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
on
account
of
work
the
early
of
the
poorer
classes
at
noon
began
to
be
postponed
among
men
who
were
more
or
less
their
own
masters
until
they
could
feel
in
a
common
phrase
they
had
broken
the
back
of
the
day
s
work
hence
the
curious
hour
of
three
in
places
to
this
day
the
sunday
is
at
four
o
clock
when
breakfast
became
more
usual
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
dinner
so
early
as
three
and
with
our
present
fashion
of
breakfast
and
lunch
to
say
nothing
of
afternoon
tea
which
we
have
transferred
from
after
to
before
dinner
the
dinner
may
be
postponed
to
as
late
an
hour
as
is
desired
without
inconvenience
lybbe
powys
then
caroline
girle
mentions
in
her
lively
journal
we
had
a
breakfast
at
holkham
in
the
genteelest
taste
with
all
kinds
of
cakes
and
fruit
placed
undesired
in
an
apartment
we
were
to
go
through
which
as
the
family
were
from
home
i
thought
was
very
clever
in
the
housekeeper
for
one
is
often
asked
by
people
whether
one
chooses
chocolate
which
forbidding
word
puts
as
intended
a
negative
on
the
table
decorations
were
unknown
even
at
large
banquets
people
sat
on
benches
and
were
served
in
the
simplest
manner
lady
newdigate
gives
an
account
of
suppers
and
prices
when
she
was
staying
at
being
examined
by
the
bart
in
regard
to
our
suppers
and
what
we
paid
he
her
cousin
owned
that
we
were
charged
but
one
shilling
and
it
seems
they
pay
two
upon
this
poor
fox
the
landlady
was
attacked
and
abused
in
very
gross
terms
so
she
came
to
us
with
streaming
eyes
to
beg
we
would
explain
to
the
edmonstones
that
our
suppers
were
never
anything
more
than
a
tart
and
cold
chicken
which
we
eat
when
the
company
went
to
supper
above
whereas
the
s
order
a
hot
supper
of
five
or
six
dishes
to
be
got
at
nine
o
she
also
gives
many
details
as
to
the
items
constituting
her
meals
we
are
going
to
sup
upon
crawfish
and
roasted
potatoes
our
feast
dinner
will
consist
of
neck
of
mutton
lamb
steaks
cold

use
knives
were
at
the
ends
and
it
was
the
fashion
to
eat
peas
with
them
the
taste
for
cleanliness
has
preserved
the
use
of
steel
forks
with
two
prongs
with
regard
to
little
bits
of
meat
which
can
not
so
well
be
taken
hold
of
with
the
two
pronged
forks
recourse
is
had
to
the
knife
which
is
broad
and
round
at
the
it
is
to
be
wished
that
forks
still
survived
in
the
public
restaurants
of
as
the
use
of
the
present
forks
in
such
places
is
one
of
the
minor
trials
of
daily
life
papendick
s
account
of
the
plate
and
services
acquired
at
her
marriage
gives
us
an
idea
of
what
was
then
thought
necessary
in
this
respect
she
says
two
of
our
rooms
were
furnished
by
her
majesty
and
a
case
of
plate
was
also
sent
by
her
which
contained
cruets
saltcellars
and
spoons
of
different
sizes
silver
forks
not
being
then
used
from
the
queen
came
also
six
large
and
six
small
knives
and
forks
to
which
mamma
added
six
more
of
each
and
a
carving
knife
and
fork
our
tea
and
coffee
set
were
of
common
indian
china
our

service
of
earthenware
to
which
for
our
rank
there
was
nothing
superior
chelsea
porcelain
and
fine
india
china
being
only
for
the
wealthy
pewter
and
delft
ware
could
also
be
had
but
were
though
papendick
was
attached
to
the
court
he
was
anything
but
wealthy
turning
to
the
novels
we
find
food
frequently
mentioned
in
when
the
little
suppers
of
minced
chicken
and
scalloped
oysters
so
necessary
after
an
early
dinner
were
always
provided
at
the
woodhouses
poor
woodhouse
s
feelings
on
these
occasions
are
mixed
he
loved
to
have
the
cloth
laid
because
it
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
youth
but
his
conviction
of
suppers
being
very
unwholesome
made
him
rather
sorry
to
see
anything
put
upon
it
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcomed
his
visitors
to
everything
his
care
for
their
health
made
him
grieve
that
they
would
eat
such
another
small
basin
of
thin
gruel
as
his
own
was
all
that
he
could
with
thorough
recommend
though
he
might
constrain
himself
while
the
ladies
were
comfortably
clearing
the
nicer
things
to
mrs
bates
let
me
propose
your
venturing
on
one
of
these
eggs
an
egg
boiled
very
soft
is
not
unwholesome
serle
understands
boiling
an
egg
better
than
anybody
i
would
not
recommend
an
egg
boiled
by
anyone
else
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
they
are
very
small
you
of
our
small
eggs
will
not
hurt
you
miss
bates
let
emma
help
you
to
a
little
bit
of
very
little
bit
ours
are
all
apple
tarts
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here
i
do
not
advise
the
custard
goddard
what
say
you
to
half
a
glass
of
wine
a
small
half
glass
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water
i
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
arthur
young
who
made
a
tour
through
the
southern
counties
of
england
in
gives
us
carefully
tabulated
facts
from
which
we
learn
that
the
average
price
for
meat
of
all
kinds
beef
mutton
veal
and
pork
was
no
more
than
per
pound
butter
was
per
pound
and
bread
a
by
we
find
that
meat
taking
one
kind
with
another
was
fivepence
a
pound
a
fowl
ninepence
to
a
shilling
a
quartern
loaf
fourpence
sugar
fourpence
a
pound
tea
six
shillings
a
pound
and
with
these
prices
it
must
be
remembered
that
wages
ruled
much
lower
than
at
present
by
when
jane
was
in
bath
the
incessant
state
of
war
had
raised
everything
she
writes
i
am
not
without
hopes
of
tempting
lloyd
to
settle
in
bath
meat
is
only
per
pound
butter
and
cheese
you
must
carefully
conceal
from
her
however
the
exorbitant
price
for
fish
a
salmon
has
been
sold
at
per
pound
the
whole
in
the
price
of
the
quartern
loaf
was
and
then
peace
was
declared
in
the
preceding
ten
years
the
scarcity
of
flour
had
been
so
great
that
all
sorts
of
changes
were
suggested
in
the
making
of
bread
the
members
of
the
privy
council
set
the
example
in
their
own
households
of
not
eating
puddings
or
anything
that
required
flour
excepting
the
necessary
bread
which
was
to
be
half
made
of
rye
flour
as
powder
for
wigs
was
no
more
used
being
needed
for
consumption
and
rice
was
recommended
to
the
poor
in
also
was
passed
the
brown
bread
act
forbidding
the
sale
of
pure
white
wheaten
bread
or
the
consumption
of
any
sort
of
bread
new
as
if
it
were
stale
it
was
thought
it
would
go
farther
in
the
seven
years
before
the
prices
of
not
only
bread
but
meat
butter
and
sugar
had
risen
to
double
what
they
had
been
previously
with
a
small
household
of
only
three
persons
in
the
absence
of
cassandra
the
ordering
at
steventon
rectory
can
not
have
occupied
much
time
or
thought
though
there
would
possibly
be
rather
more
active
superintendence
of
the
domestics
than
at
present
ladies
of
comfortable
means
did
not
then
any
more
than
now
spend
all
their
mornings
in
the
kitchen
as
is
sometimes
erroneously
supposed
jane
would
doubtless
fill
up
her
time
with
a
little
practising
a
little
singing
the
of
a
hat
correspondence
and
the
other
small
items
that
go
to
make
up
a
country
girl
s
life
in
the
usual
avocations
of
a
genteel
young
lady
the
pianoforte
when
they
were
weary
of
the
harp
copying
some
indifferent
drawings
gilding
a
set
of
flower
pots
and
netting
white
gloves
and
veils
we
see
a
tedious
inanition
quite
foreign
to
our
conception
of
jane
though
gardening
was
not
then
a
hobby
as
it
is
now
there
would
be
general
superintendence
of
the
gardener
and
many
a
lingering
walk
by
the
borders
and
on
sunny
mornings
jane
evidently
loved
flowers
as
she
often
refers
to
them
in
her
letters
hacker
has
been
here
putting
in
the
fruit
trees
a
new
plan
has
been
suggested
concerning
the
plantation
of
the
new
enclosures
on
the
side
of
the
elm
walk
the
doubt
is
whether
it
would
be
better
to
make
a
little
orchard
of
it
by
planting
apples
pears
and
cherries
or
whether
larch
mountain
ash
and
there
was
at
this
time
a
reaction
against
the
stiff
and
formal
gardening
which
had
been
in
fashion
since
introduced
by
william
iii
it
is
from
wild
and
uncultivated
woods
that
is
from
pure
nature
that
the
present
english
have
borrowed
their

speaks
of
wages
for
gardeners
being
very
high
i
have
myself
seen
a
spot
of
ground
not
exceeding
an
acre
occupied
partly
by
a
small
house
partly
by
gravel
walks
with
two
beds
of
flowers
where
the
gardener
who
was
lodging
in
the
house
had
a
salary
of
twelve
guineas
a
wages
for
all
classes
were
as
has
been
said
much
lower
than
now
in
regard
to
this
question
the
cry
of
a
constant
reader
to
in
is
tell
a
servant
now
in
the
mildest
manner
they
have
not
done
their
work
to
please
you
and
you
are
told
to
provide
for
yourself
and
should
you
offer
to
speak
again
they
are
gone
i
look
upon
their
exorbitant
increase
of
wages
as
chiefly
conducive
to
their
impertinence
for
when
they
had
five
or
six
pounds
a
year
a
month
being
out
of
place
was
severely
felt
but
now
their
wages
are
doubled
they
have
in
great
measure
lost
their
dependence
and
what
is
this
increase
of
wages
for
not
in
order
to
lay
by
a
little
in
case
of
sickness
but
to
squander
in
dress
no
young
woman
now
can
bear
a
strong
pair
of
leather
shoes
but
they
must
wear
spanish
leather
and
so
on
in
every
article
of
by
arthur
young
s
account
wages
were
less
even
than
above
he
says
that
dairymaids
received
an
average
of
yearly
and
other
maids
prices
possibly
varied
in
different
places
being
higher
in
london
where
labour
was
scarcer
wages
are
very
considerable
a
fat
welsh
girl
who
has
just
come
out
of
the
country
scarce
understood
a
word
of
english
capable
of
nothing
but
washing
scouring
and
sweeping
the
rooms
received
six
guineas
a
year
besides
a
guinea
a
year
for
her
tea
which
all
servant
maids
either
take
in
money
or
have
it
found
for
them
twice
a
day
the
wages
of
a
cook

who
knows
how
to

and
boil
amount
to
twenty
guineas
a
grosley
when
the
household
details
had
been
attended
to
the
members
of
the
austen
family
must
sometimes
have
walked
in
the
rough
lanes
in
order
to
avoid
the
mud
in
winter
or
wet
weather
ladies
wore
pattens
which
had
an
iron
ring
underneath
and
raised
the
foot
these
pattens
clinked
as
they
walked
and
must
have
been
very
bad
in
causing
an
awkward
drag
in
the
gait
but
country
lane
walking
was
not
greatly
in
favour
then
women
s
gowns
with
long
clinging
skirts
were
not
adapted
for
such
promenades
and
it
is
amusing
to
think
how
surprised
either
jane
or
cassandra
would
have
been
could
they
have
met
a
modern
girl
with
gaiters
and
comfortable
trim
short
skirt
well
clearing
the
ground
though
visiting
the
poor
was
not
a
regular
duty
it
is
evident
from
many
indications
that
the
girls
took
pleasure
in
knowing
the
parishioners
and
they
must
have
been
to
see
them
occasionally
the
life
of
labourers
was
at
that
time
extremely
dull
and
it
is
little
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
were
rough
boors
when
they
were
left
entirely
without
reasonable
means
of
recreation
and
without
any
mental
nourishment
the
was
often
the
s
sole
chance
of
relaxation
very
few
could
read
or
write
in
the
long
winter
evenings
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
sit
in
a
draughty
cottage
over
a
small
without
any
of
the
luxuries
that
are
now
considered
necessaries
in
every
labourer
s
cottage
the
interiors
resembled
a
highland
crofter
s
hut
with
beaten
earth
flooring
often
damp
rough
uncovered
walls
no
gay
prints
or
polished
furniture
the
introduction
of
machinery
has
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
altered
the
entire
aspect
of
life
when
sofa
legs
can
be
turned
out
by
the
hundred
by
a
machine
for
little
cost
everyone
can
afford
sofas
when
the
process
of
reproduction
of
pictures
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
every
wall
is
adorned
even
the
woven
quilts
and
patterned
now
so
little
thought
of
as
to
be
hardly
noticed
were
then
unknown
plain
dyes
for
materials
were
all
that
could
be
had
though
probably
cowper
s
dismal
picture
is
an
extreme
case
it
has
the
merit
of
being
the
frugal
housewife
trembles
when
she
lights
her
scanty
stock
of
brushwood
blazing
clear
but
dying
soon
like
all
terrestrial
joys
the
brown
loaf
lodged
on
the
shelf
half
eaten
without
sauce
of
savoury

or

costlier
still
all
the
care
ingenious
parsimony
takes
but
just
saves
the
small
inventory
bed
and
stool
skillet
and
old
carved
chest
from
public
but
to
set
against
this
we
have
the
idyllic
pictures
of
cottage
life
to
be
found
amid
the
works
of
morland
and
his
one
of
these
engraved
by
grozer
is
given
as
an
illustration
here
though
the
cottage
is
low
and
dark
with
thatched
roof
and
small
windows
the
healthy
smiling
faces
of
the
cottagers
themselves
are
very
attractive
the
truth
probably
lay
in
the
mean
between
cowper
s
realism
and
the
artist
s
idealism
health
and
good
temper
may
have
been
found
even
amid
dirt
and
squalor
illustration
the
happy
cottagers
at
that
time
the
state
of
the
roads
cut
off
the
dweller
in
a
small
village
from
any
neighbouring
town
at
present
the
three
or
four
miles
of
good
solid
road
in
and
out
of
a
provincial
town
are
nothing
to
a
young
man
who
starts
off
after
his
work
on
saturday
evenings
and
in
many
cases
he
has
a
bicycle
with
which
to
run
over
them
more
easily
still
at
that
time
the
roads
even
main
roads
were
in
a
filthy
state
the
act
of
by
making
turnpike
roads
compulsory
did
much
to
improve
them
but
previously
they
were
often
mere
quagmires
with
deep
ruts
similar
to
the
roads
running
by
the
side
of
a
field
where
carting
has
been
going
on
many
and
many
a
record
is
there
of
the
coaches
being
stuck
or
overturned
in
the
heavy
mud
the
days
of
village
and
sociability
seemed
to
have
passed
away
in
puritan
times
never
to
revive
and
had
not
been
replaced
by
the
personal
pleasures
of
the
present
time
a
labourer
of
jane
austen
s
days
had
the
bad
luck
to
live
in
a
sort
of
intermediate
time
not
for
him
the
with
its
bright
light
and
warm
fire
the
concert
the
club
and
the
penny
readings
the
bicycle
or
the
piano
here
is
horace
walpole
s
picture
of
suburban
felicity
the
road
was
one
string
of
stage
coaches
loaded
within
and
without
with
noisy
jolly
folks
and
chaises
and
gigs
that
had
been
pleasuring
in
clouds
of
dust
every
door
and
every
window
of
every
house
was
open
lights
in
every
shop
every
door
with
women
sitting
in
the
street
every
inn
crowded
with
drunken
topers
for
you
know
the
english
always
announce
their
sense
of
heat
or
cold
by
drinking
well
it
was
impossible
not
to
enjoy
such
a
scene
of
happiness
and
affluence
in
every
village
and
amongst
the
lowest
of
the
people
who
are
told
by
villainous
scribblers
that
they
are
oppressed
and
wages
for
labourers
as
in
the
case
of
servants
were
very
low
arthur
young
gives
an
interesting
digest
of
the
wages
then
in
vogue
in
the
southern
counties
he
divides
the
year
into
three
parts
harvest
five
weeks
six
weeks
and
winter
weeks
the
average
of
weekly
wages
for
these
three
respective
periods
was
and
making
a
weekly
medium
of
about
all
the
year
round
the
writer
is
very
severe
on
the
labourers
for
what
he
considers
their
gross
extravagance
in
the
matter
of
tea
and
sugar
indeed
his
remarks
sound
so
queer
to
our
ears
now
that
they
are
worth
quoting
at
some
all
united
in
the
assertion
that
the
practice
of
having
tea
and
sugar
twice
a
day
was
constant
and
that
it
was
inconceivable
how
much
it
impoverished
the
poor
this
is
no
matter
of
trivial
consequence
no
transitory
or
local
evil
it
is
universal
and
unceasing
the
amount
of
it
is
great
this
single
article
cost
numerous
families
more
than
sufficient
to
remove
their
real
distresses
which
they
will
submit
to
rather
than
lay
aside
their
tea
and
an
object
seemingly
of
little
account
but
in
reality
of
infinite
importance
is
the
custom
coming
in
of
men
making
tea
an
article
of
their
food
almost
as
much
as
women
labourers
losing
their
time
to
come
and
go
to
the
tea
table
nay
farmers
servants
even
demanding
tea
for
their
breakfast
with
the
maids
which
has
actually
been
the
case
in
east
kent
if
the
men
come
to
lose
as
much
of
their
time
at
tea
as
the
women
and
injure
their
health
by
so
bad
a
beverage
the
poor
in
general
will
find
themselves
far
more
distressed
than
ever
wants
i
allow
are
numerous
but
what
name
are
we
to
give
to
those
that
are
voluntarily
embraced
in
order
for
indulgence
in
tea
and
sugar
there
is
no
clearer
fact
than
that
two
persons
the
wife
and
one
daughter
for
instance
drinking
tea
once
a
day
amounts
in
a
year
to
a
fourth
of
the
price
of
all
the
wheat
consumed
by
a
family
of
five
persons
twice
a
day
are
half
so
that
those
who
leave
off
two
tea
drinkings
can
afford
to
eat
wheat
at
double
the
price
calculated
at
six
shillings
a
bushel
tea
was
of
course
then
very
expensive
lady
newdigate
writes
to
her
husband
in
i
enclose
barton
s
account
for
tea
the
sum
frights
one
but
if
the
common
tea
says
it
eighty
pounds
the
chest
it
will
answer
well
the
best
is
full
a
pound
but
mundays
and
newdigates
who
have
also
a
lot
and
have
also
had
from
the
shops
since
the
new
tax
was
laid
say
it
is
better
than
what
you
can
buy
for
cheverels
of
cheverel
besides
other
occupations
such
as
have
been
slightly
indicated
there
was
one
in
jane
s
life
about
which
she
seldom
spoke
to
anyone
from
her
earliest
childhood
the
instinct
to
write
had
been
in
her
and
she
had
scribbled
probably
in
secret
such
a
thing
would
not
be
encouraged
in
a
child
of
her
time
nowadays
when
every
little
rosina
and
clarence
has
a
page
to
themselves
in
the
weekly
papers
and
can
see
her
or
his
own
childish
effusions
in
print
winning
thereby
the
proud
and
admiring
commendations
of
mother
and
father
the
case
is
different
jane
wrote
because
she
had
to
write
it
was
there
and
it
must
come
out
but
she
probably
looked
on
her
writing
as
something
to
be
ashamed
of
a
waste
of
time
and
only
read
her
compositions
to
her
brothers
and
sisters
under
compulsion
when
no
adults
were
present
says
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
how
early
an
age
she
began
to
write
there
are
copy
books
extant
containing
tales
some
of
which
must
have
been
composed
while
she
was
a
young
girl
as
they
had
amounted
to
a
considerable
number
by
the
time
she
was
sixteen
her
earliest
stories
are
of
a
slight
and
flimsy
texture
and
are
generally
intended
to
be
nonsensical
but
the
nonsense
has
much
spirit
in
he
gives
as
an
instance
the
mystery
a
short
unfinished
he
says
later
but
between
these
childish
effusions
and
the
composition
of
her
living
works
there
intervened
another
stage
of
her
progress
during
which
she
produced
some
stories
not
without
merit
but
which
she
never
deemed
worthy
of
it
was
one
of
these
at
first
called
and
which
became
the
germ
of
and
and
perhaps
from
these
early
stories
she
might
had
she
lived
have
developed
and
produced
other
books
the
beautiful
old
town
of
winchester
once
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
lies
only
twelve
miles
from
steventon
and
though
there
was
no
smooth
hard
as
we
know
it
the
austens
carriage
horses
were
probably
animals
who
pulled
their
load
through
the
mire
with
right
goodwill
many
an
expedition
to
the
town
must
jane
have
made
and
well
would
she
know
the
ancient
part
by
the
cathedral
and
college
so
little
altered
now
that
we
may
look
upon
it
with
her
eyes
the
red
walls
with
their
garnishing
of
lichen
and
ferns
the
beautiful
nooks
and
sunny
corners
would
all
be
very
familiar
to
her
and
in
these
happy
days
when
she
was
still
a
girl
without
a
thought
of
fame
how
little
would
she
think
that
one
day
she
should
pass
away
close
to
the
old
grey
cathedral
which
itself
should
form
her
and
which
would
be
visited
on
that
account
by
hundreds
yet
unborn
who
knew
her
only
in
her
books
chapter
v
the
novels
the
life
of
a
genius
is
after
all
secondary
to
the
works
by
which
he
lives
no
one
would
want
to
know
anything
about
him
had
not
the
works
aroused
their
interest
the
personality
when
revealed
is
disappointing
sometimes
repulsive
but
that
can
not
alter
the
value
of
the
work
there
is
certainly
no
fear
that
we
shall
find
anything
repulsive
in
the
simple
life
of
jane
austen
or
that
we
shall
be
disappointed
in
knowing
her
as
she
was
but
for
all
that
the
works
are
the
thing
one
writer
on
jane
austen
in
what
purports
to
be
a
book
has
devoted
three
hundred
and
pages
out
of
three
hundred
and
to
a
synopsis
of
the
plots
of
the
novels
told
in
bald
and
commonplace
language
without
any
of
the
sparkle
of
the
original
so
that
even
the
extracts
embedded
in
such
a
context
seem
flat
and
uninteresting
this
sort
of
is
worse
than
useless
it
is
positively
harmful
anyone
who
read
the
volume
before
reading
the
original
novels
would
assuredly
never
go
to
them
after
having
seen
them
flattened
out
in
this
style
there
is
no
place
for
such
a
book
anyone
who
is
interested
in
jane
austen
at
all
should
read
her
works
as
they
are
there
can
be
no
excuse
on
the
ground
of
length
the
longest
runs
to
four
hundred
and
pages
of
clear
type
in
duodecimo
form
for
the
publication
of
an
abridged
form
of
richardson
s
works
there
might
be
excuse
anyone
who
read
such
an
abridgement
might
be
forgiven
for
richardson
s
masterpiece
filled
seven
volumes
but
with
jane
austen
there
is
nothing
to
abridge
every
sentence
tells
there
is
no
prolixity
every
word
has
its
intrinsic
value
and
to
retell
her
sparkling
little
stories
in
commonplace
language
is
indeed
to
attempt
the
painting
of
the
rose
this
book
at
all
events
is
intended
only
for
those
who
know
the
novels
at
first
hand
and
there
shall
be
no
explaining
no
pandering
to
that
laziness
that
prefers
hash
to
joints
taking
it
for
granted
that
everyone
knows
the
six
complete
novels
we
enter
here
on
a
discussion
of
the
excellencies
common
to
all
leaving
them
to
be
discussed
singly
as
they
occur
chronologically
in
the
life
of
their
author
the
first
question
that
occurs
to
anyone
in
this
connection
is
how
is
it
that
these
books
without
plot
without
adventures
without
have
managed
to
entrance
generations
of
readers
and
to
be
as
much
alive
as
when
they
were
written
the
answer
is
simple
and
comprehensive
are
of
human
nature
all
compact
this
is
the
first
and
greatest
quality
we
have
in
them
no
heroes
and
heroines
no
villains
but
only
men
and
women
and
while
the
world
lasts
stories
of
real
live
characters
will
hold
their
own
the
second
characteristic
which
is
the
salt
of
fiction
is
the
keen
sense
of
humour
that
runs
throughout
jane
austen
s
observation
of
the
foibles
of
her
was
unusually
sharp
her
remarks
in
her
letters
are
not
always
kind
but
in
the
novels
this
sharp
and
keen
relish
of
what
is
absurd
is
softened
down
so
as
to
be
nowhere
offensive
like
her
own
elizabeth
she
might
say
i
hope
i
never
ridicule
what
is
wise
or
good
follies
and
nonsense
whims
and
inconsistencies
do
divert
me
i
own
and
i
laugh
at
them
whenever
i
a
third
characteristic
which
is
the
result
of
genius
alone
is
her
dainty
sense
of
selection
she
never
gives
anything
redundant
either
in
the
actions
or
words
of
her
characters
just
enough
is
said
or
done
to
reveal
the
people
themselves
to
us
one
has
only
to
think
of
writers
deficient
in
this
quality
to
realise
how
essential
it
is
to
enjoyment
in
miss
ferrier
s
for
instance
there
are
good
and
striking
scenes
but
in
her
conversations
she
never
knows
when
to
stop
the
tedious
sentences
have
to
be
skipped
in
order
to
get
on
with
the
story
the
art
of
selection
is
that
which
distinguishes
real
dramatic
talent
from
photographic
realism
to
be
able
to
put
down
on
paper
exactly
what
average
people
say
is
certainly
a
gift
for
few
can
do
it
but
a
far
higher
gift
is
to
select
and
combine
just
those
speeches
and
actions
which
give
the
desired
effect
without
leaving
any
sense
of
omission
or
incompleteness
jane
austen
had
the
power
also
of
giving
a
flash
of
insight
into
a
state
of
mind
or
a
personal
feeling
in
a
few
words
more
than
any
writer
before
or
since
it
is
one
of
her
strongest
points
take
for
example
that
scene
when
henry
tilney
instructing
catherine
talked
of
foregrounds
distances
and
second
distances
side
screens
and
perspectives
lights
and
shades
and
catherine
was
so
hopeful
a
scholar
that
when
they
gained
the
top
of
beechen
cliff
she
voluntarily
rejected
the
whole
city
of
bath
as
unworthy
to
make
part
of
the
landscape
or
the
opening
sentences
of
miss
maria
ward
of
huntingdon
with
only
seven
thousand
pounds
had
the
good
luck
to
captivate
sir
thomas
bertram
of
mansfield
park
in
the
county
of
northampton
and
to
be
thereby
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
baronet
s
lady
with
all
the
comforts
and
consequences
of
a
handsome
house
and
large
income
all
huntingdon
exclaimed
on
the
greatness
of
the
match
and
her
uncle
the
lawyer
himself
allowed
her
to
be
at
least
three
thousand
pounds
short
of
any
equitable
claim
to
it
is
by
touches
such
as
these
that
the
characters
are
made
to
live
before
us
jane
never
condescends
to
the
device
of
tricks
which
dickens
allowed
himself
to
use
with
such
wearisome
iteration
we
have
none
of
the
moustache
went
up
and
the
nose
came
down
style
it
is
by
a
perfect
perspective
by
light
touches
given
with
admirable
effect
that
we
know
the
difference
between
fanny
price
and
anne
elliot
both
good
sweet
retiring
girls
or
between
elinor
dashwood
and
emma
woodhouse
who
both
had
the
generosity
of
character
to
sympathise
with
another
s
love
affairs
while
hiding
their
own
henry
tilney
and
edmund
crawford
were
both
young
clergymen
of
a
priggish
type
but
henry
s
didactic
reflections
are
not
in
the
least
the
same
as
those
which
edmund
would
have
uttered
the
silliness
of
palmer
with
her
final
summary
on
the
recreant
willoughby
she
was
determined
to
drop
his
acquaintance
immediately
and
she
was
very
thankful
she
had
never
been
acquainted
with
him
at
all
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
combe
magna
was
not
so
near
cleveland
but
it
did
not
signify
for
it
was
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
visit
she
hated
him
so
much
that
she
was
resolved
never
to
mention
his
name
again
and
she
should
tell
everyone
she
saw
how
good
for
nothing
he
was
is
entirely
different
from
the
continuous
weak
outpourings
of
poor
little
miss
bates
and
when
i
brought
out
the
baked
apples
from
the
closet
and
hoped
our
friends
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some
oh
said
he
directly
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good
and
these
are
the
finest
looking
apples
i
ever
saw
in
my
that
you
know
was
so
and
i
am
sure
by
his
manner
it
was
no
compliment
indeed
they
are
very
delightful
apples
and
wallis
does
them
full
justice
only
we
do
not
have
them
baked
more
than
twice
and
woodhouse
made
us
promise
to
have
them
done
three
times
but
miss
woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it
the
apples
themselves
are
the
very
finest
sort
for
baking
beyond
a
and
so
on
and
so
on
for
a
page
or
more
the
truth
is
that
jane
austen
seized
on
qualities
which
are
frequently
found
in
human
nature
and
developed
them
with
such
fidelity
that
nearly
all
of
us
feel
that
we
have
at
one
time
or
another
met
a
miss
bates
or
a
norris
or
that
we
can
see
traits
in
others
which
resemble
theirs
it
is
this
which
makes
the
appeal
to
all
humanity
she
did
not
take
one
person
out
of
her
acquaintance
and
depict
him
or
her
but
represented
in
characters
of
her
own
creating
these
salient
traits
which
will
ever
revive
perennially
while
men
and
women
exist
lord
macaulay
does
not
hesitate
to
speak
of
jane
in
the
same
breath
with
shakespeare
shakespeare
has
had
neither
equal
nor
second
but
among
the
writers
who
have
approached
nearest
to
the
manner
of
the
great
master
we
have
no
hesitation
in
placing
jane
austen
a
woman
of
whom
england
is
justly
proud
she
has
given
us
a
multitude
of
characters
all
in
a
certain
sense
commonplace
all
such
as
we
meet
every
day
yet
they
are
all
as
perfectly
discriminated
from
each
other
as
if
they
were
the
most
eccentric
of
human
and
archbishop
whateley
makes
the
suggestive
remark
it
is
no
fool
that
can
describe
fools
before
the
birth
of
jane
austen
the
novel
which
had
been
hardly
considered
in
england
for
many
centuries
had
suddenly
found
a
quartette
of
exponents
which
had
placed
the
country
in
the
foremost
rank
of
this
branch
it
is
rare
indeed
that
four
such
men
as
richardson
fielding
smollett
and
sterne
with
powers
of
imagination
which
make
their
work
classic
should
be
evolved
at
the
same
date
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
the
theory
which
declares
that
the
world
in
its
onward
rush
through
space
passes
through
regions
impregnated
with
certain
forms
of
ether
that
affect
men
s
minds
must
have
some
grain
of
truth
when
simultaneously
there
leaped
forth
four
exponents
and
first
masters
of
an
art
that
hitherto
can
hardly
have
been
said
to
exist
the
united
scope
of
their
four
lives
ranged
from
to
and
between
these
dates
england
was
enriched
for
all
time
with
these
four
jane
austen
s
work
has
little
in
common
it
is
to
richardson
only
that
her
novels
owe
anything
and
they
differ
from
richardson
s
in
many
striking
particulars
apart
from
the
masters
already
mentioned
a
greater
mass
of
trash
and
rubbish
never
disgraced
the
press
of
any
country
than
the
ordinary
novels
that
filled
and
supported
circulating
libraries
down
nearly
to
the
time
of
miss
edgeworth
s
first
appearance
there
had
been
vicar
of
to
be
sure
before
and
miss
burney
s
and
and
mackenzie
s
of
and
some
bolder
and
more
varied
fictions
of
the
misses
lee
but
the
staple
of
our
novel
market
was
beyond
imagination
despicable
and
had
consequently
sunk
and
degraded
the
whole
department
of
literature
of
which
it
had
usurped
the
jeffrey
ed
and
macaulay
says
most
of
the
popular
novels
which
preceded
were
such
as
no
lady
would
have
written
and
many
of
them
were
such
as
no
lady
could
without
confusion
own
that
she
had
read
the
very
name
of
novel
was
held
in
horror
among
religious
people
in
decent
families
which
did
not
profess
extraordinary
sanctity
there
was
a
strong
feeling
against
all
such
works
sir
anthony
absolute
two
or
three
years
before
appeared
spoke
the
sense
of
the
great
body
of
sober
fathers
and
husbands
when
he
pronounced
the
circulating
library
an
evergreen
tree
of
diabolical
knowledge
this
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
grave
and
reflecting
increased
the
evil
from
which
it
had
sprung
the
novelist
having
little
character
to
lose
and
having
few
readers
among
serious
people
took
without
scruple
liberties
which
in
our
generation
seem
almost
the
effect
that
miss
burney
s
stories
had
upon
contemporary
readers
may
be
judged
from
a
letter
of
twining
a
country
clergyman
of
education
and
standing
who
wrote
in
to
her
father
burney
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
gobbled
up
as
soon
as
i
could
get
it
from
my
library
i
never
knew
such
a
piece
of
work
made
with
a
book
in
my
life
it
has
drawn
iron
tears
down
cheeks
that
were
never
wetted
with
pity
before
it
has
made
novel
readers
of
callous
old
maiden
ladies
who
have
not
for
years
received
pleasure
from
anything
but
scandal
judge
then
what
effect
it
has
had
upon
the
young
and
the
tender
hearted
i
know
two
amiable
sisters
at
colchester
sensible
and
accomplished
women
who
were
found
blubbering
at
such
a
rate
one
morning
the
tale
had
drawn
them
on
till
near
the
hour
of
an
engagement
to
dinner
which
they
were
actually
obliged
to
put
off
because
there
was
not
time
to
recover
their
red
eyes
and
swelled
miss
burney
s
works
are
real
enough
and
not
lightly
to
be
dismissed
she
understood
the
human
heart
and
especially
the
heart
of
a
girl
her
sentimental
side
is
perfect
but
beyond
that
she
ceases
to
claim
anything
out
of
the
common
her
society
types
are
types
only
the
gay
young
man
a
rake
but
charming
at
heart
whose
excesses
were
but
the
wildness
of
an
youth
had
been
drawn
many
times
before
when
she
goes
beyond
affairs
of
the
heart
she
at
once
caricatures
her
captain
and
duval
are
gross
and
overdrawn
even
according
to
the
manners
of
the
age
miss
burney
preceded
jane
austen
by
several
years
was
published
in
when
the
was
but
three
years
old
came
out
four
years
later
and
in
the
same
year
in
which
and
was
written
though
it
was
not
published
until
there
is
no
doubt
that
jane
austen
owed
much
to
her
rival
and
predecessor
but
her
gifts
were
incomparably
the
greater
miss
burney
s
cleverness
consisted
in
the
portrayal
of
feeling
in
a
young
girl
s
sensitive
mind
her
stories
are
stories
of
fashion
and
incident
jane
austen
s
are
of
country
life
and
simple
everyday
scenes
the
one
had
its
vogue
and
as
an
account
of
contemporary
manners
the
books
have
their
value
and
delight
now
especially
which
stands
high
above
its
successors
each
one
of
which
is
poorer
than
the
preceding
one
but
none
are
to
be
compared
with
any
of
jane
austen
s
novels
which
are
for
all
time
miss
edgeworth
indeed
draws
characters
and
details
conversations
such
as
occur
in
real
life
with
a
spirit
of
fidelity
not
to
be
surpassed
but
her
stories
are
most
romantically
improbable
all
the
important
events
in
them
being
brought
about
by
most
providential
archbishop
whateley
it
was
a
transition
age
from
the
conventional
to
the
natural
as
in
the
admiration
of
landscape
the
love
for
natural
gardens
the
gradual
disappearance
of
the
formal
and
empty
compliment
to
which
women
had
hitherto
been
treated
we
find
taste
changing
so
in
literature
the
conventional
was
giving
way
to
the
natural
fielding
and
smollett
had
broken
down
the
barriers
in
this
respect
they
had
depicted
life
as
it
was
not
as
convention
had
decreed
it
should
be
hence
their
gigantic
success
but
the
life
they
saw
and
rendered
was
the
life
of
a
man
of
the
world
with
all
its
roughness
and
brutality
jane
austen
was
the
first
to
draw
exactly
what
she
saw
around
her
in
a
humdrum
country
life
and
to
discard
all
incident
all
adventure
all
grotesque
types
for
perfect
simplicity
she
little
understood
what
she
was
doing
but
herein
lies
her
wonderful
power
she
was
a
pioneer
jane
s
writing
had
nothing
in
common
with
radcliffe
whose
style
is
mimicked
in
it
had
absolutely
no
adventures
the
fall
of
louisa
on
the
cobb
is
perhaps
the
most
thrilling
episode
in
all
the
books
yet
by
virtue
of
its
entire
simplicity
its
naturalness
its
gaiety
her
writing
never
fails
to
interest
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
tribute
to
her
genius
lies
in
the
fact
that
though
her
books
are
simplicity
itself
dealing
with
the
of
artless
girls
they
are
read
and
admired
not
only
by
girls
and
women
but
more
especially
by
men
of
exceptional
mental
calibre
it
has
been
said
that
the
appreciation
of
them
is
a
test
of
intellect
though
her
novels
are
novels
of
sentiment
they
never
drift
into
sickly
sentiment
they
are
wholesome
and
healthy
throughout
with
tragedy
she
had
nothing
to
do
her
work
is
comedy
pure
comedy
from
beginning
to
end
and
as
comedies
well
done
are
the
most
recreative
of
all
forms
of
reading
it
is
no
wonder
that
slight
as
are
her
plots
hardly
to
be
considered
minute
as
are
the
incidents
the
attention
of
readers
should
ever
be
kept
alive
in
all
her
books
marriage
is
the
supreme
end
the
meeting
the
obstacles
the
gradual
surmounting
of
these
and
the
happy
ending
occur
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
and
yet
each
one
differs
from
all
the
others
and
she
is
never
monotonous
every
single
book
ends
well
and
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
there
is
not
a
death
in
one
of
them
when
after
a
slight
improvement
marianne
in
and
grows
the
repose
of
the
latter
marianne
grew
more
and
more
disturbed
and
her
sister
who
watched
with
unremitting
attention
her
continual
change
of
posture
and
heard
the
frequent
but
inarticulate
sounds
of
complaint
which
passed
her
lips
was
most
wishing
to
rouse
her
from
so
painful
a
slumber
when
marianne
awakened
by
some
accidental
noise
in
the
house
started
hastily
up
and
with
feverish
wildness
cried
out
is
mamma
coming
hour
after
hour
passed
away
in
sleepless
pain
and
delirium
on
marianne
s
side
and
in
the
most
cruel
anxiety
on
elinor
s
we
know
that
in
most
books
we
should
expect
the
worst
but
with
jane
austen
we
are
sure
that
it
will
all
turn
out
well
as
indeed
it
does
and
our
feelings
are
not
unduly
harrowed
one
point
which
is
obvious
in
all
the
books
is
the
utter
lack
of
conversation
except
about
the
merest
trivialities
among
women
in
and
it
is
remarked
of
a
dinner
given
by
john
dashwood
that
no
poverty
of
any
kind
except
of
conversation
appeared
when
the
ladies
withdrew
to
the
after
dinner
this
poverty
was
particularly
evident
for
the
gentlemen
had
supplied
the
discourse
with
some
variety
of
politics
enclosing
land
and
breaking
then
it
was
all
over
and
one
subject
only
engaged
the
ladies
till
coffee
came
in
which
was
the
comparative
height
of
harry
dashwood
and
lady
middleton
s
second
son
william
who
were
nearly
of
the
same
age
the
two
mothers
though
each
really
convinced
that
her
own
son
was
the
taller
politely
decided
in
favour
of
the
other
the
two
grandmothers
with
not
less
partiality
but
more
sincerity
were
equally
earnest
in
support
of
their
own
the
christian
names
of
that
date
were
plain
and
for
women
strictly
limited
in
number
it
detracts
something
from
a
heroine
to
be
called
fanny
price
or
anne
elliot
and
emma
woodhouse
and
elizabeth
bennet
are
little
better
elinor
and
marianne
dashwood
are
the
most
fancy
names
applied
by
jane
to
any
of
her
heroines
another
point
which
may
be
noticed
in
the
novels
is
that
the
outward
forms
of
religion
beyond
the
fact
of
a
man
s
being
a
clergyman
are
never
mentioned
and
that
on
all
religious
matters
jane
is
silent
but
this
does
not
signify
that
she
was
not
herself
truly
religious
at
heart
for
we
have
the
testimony
of
those
who
knew
her
to
the
contrary
particularly
that
of
her
brother
henry
in
his
preface
prefixed
to
the
first
edition
of
published
after
her
death
but
though
actual
religion
does
not
appear
in
her
pages
the
lessons
that
the
books
teach
are
none
the
less
enforced
had
she
been
taking
for
her
sole
text
the
merit
of
unselfishness
she
could
not
have
done
more
or
indeed
half
so
much
to
further
the
spread
of
that
virtue
to
read
the
books
straight
through
one
after
the
other
is
to
feel
the
petty
meanness
of
and
the
small
gain
that
lies
therein
the
talk
of
the
mammas
such
as
bennet
who
are
perfectly
incapable
of
seeing
their
neighbours
interest
should
it
clash
with
their
own
the
picture
of
the
egregious
norris
with
her
grasping
at
the
aspect
of
generosity
and
without
any
intention
of
putting
herself
to
any
inconvenience
thereby
the
weakness
of
such
characters
as
willoughby
in
and
who
allow
themselves
to
drift
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
without
a
thought
of
the
after
misery
they
may
cause
each
and
all
of
these
are
more
potent
than
a
volume
of
sermons
it
may
be
noted
that
jane
austen
chose
her
characters
from
the
class
of
life
in
which
she
herself
lived
we
meet
in
her
pages
no
dukes
or
duchesses
and
only
a
few
slightly
sketched
labourers
and
gardeners
who
are
brought
in
when
inevitable
the
story
itself
is
concerned
with
people
of
the
middle
classes
the
squires
and
country
gentlemen
the
clergymen
and
prosperous
tradespeople
we
have
no
inimitable
rustics
as
in
george
eliot
s
wonderful
books
nor
any
disreputable
knaves
of
the
fashionable
rich
as
in
miss
burney
s
works
it
is
however
a
remarkable
fact
that
all
the
mankind
are
always
at
leisure
to
picnic
and
dance
attendance
on
the
ladies
at
any
hour
of
the
day
we
have
no
business
men
rides
and
excursions
and
picnics
are
always
provided
with
a
full
complement
of
idle
young
men
to
match
the
young
women
to
this
rule
the
clergymen
are
of
course
no
exception
there
was
a
particular
sort
of
country
gentleman
who
seemed
to
flourish
in
those
days
of
the
type
of
knightley
and
bennet
these
men
did
not
own
enough
land
to
call
themselves
squires
their
farming
was
very
slight
they
owned
a
secure
fortune
in
some
safe
investment
and
apparently
spent
their
lives
in
the
insipid
avocations
which
until
recently
were
the
lot
of
nearly
all
men
who
were
neither
rich
nor
poor
they
played
cards
and
rode
and
saw
their
neighbours
and
read
the
newspapers
without
seeming
to
feel
their
time
hang
at
all
heavy
on
their
hands
this
breed
seems
almost
extinct
now
we
are
all
too
excitable
and
live
too
rapidly
to
make
it
possible
a
man
with
such
an
income
as
either
of
the
two
mentioned
would
almost
certainly
travel
or
take
up
some
special
hobby
he
would
be
a
social
reformer
or
on
his
county
council
a
a
or
something
of
the
kind
with
occupations
varied
enough
to
afford
him
some
apology
for
his
existence
the
lowest
of
what
may
be
called
jane
austen
s
speaking
parts
are
filled
by
tradesmen
or
people
just
emerging
from
trade
as
the
gardeners
in
and
who
still
lived
at
the
business
house
in
gracechurch
street
for
it
was
a
time
when
house
and
shop
were
not
divided
her
characters
are
all
supposed
to
be
gentlepeople
but
there
is
a
difference
between
those
who
are
of
better
family
than
others
such
as
bingley
who
condescends
in
marrying
jane
bennet
there
is
one
point
on
which
i
venture
to
disagree
with
pollock
who
in
his
extremely
suggestive
and
interesting
book
on
austen
and
her
comment
has
been
made
and
justly
made
on
the
perfect
breeding
and
manners
of
those
people
in
miss
austen
s
novels
who
are
supposed
and
intended
to
be
on
the
contrary
to
go
no
further
than
and
darcy
himself
passes
every
canon
of
gentlemanly
conduct
and
the
misses
bingley
who
were
supposed
to
be
of
irreproachable
breeding
betray
vulgarity
and
lack
of
courtesy
in
every
sentence
the
observations
of
miss
bingley
on
elizabeth
and
darcy
would
disgrace
a
when
darcy
has
danced
once
with
elizabeth
miss
bingley
draws
near
to
him
and
observes
of
the
society
she
is
you
are
considering
how
insupportable
it
would
be
to
pass
many
evenings
in
this
this
society
and
indeed
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
i
never
was
more
annoyed
the
insipidity
and
yet
the
nothingness
and
yet
the
of
all
these
people
what
would
i
give
to
hear
your
strictures
on
them
your
conjecture
is
totally
wrong
i
assure
you
my
mind
was
more
agreeably
engaged
i
have
been
meditating
on
the
very
great
pleasure
which
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
in
the
face
of
a
pretty
woman
can
bestow
miss
bingley
immediately
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
face
and
desired
he
would
tell
her
what
lady
had
the
credit
of
inspiring
such
reflections
darcy
replied
with
great
intrepidity
miss
elizabeth
bennet
miss
elizabeth
bennet
repeated
miss
bingley
i
am
all
astonishment
how
long
has
she
been
such
a
favourite
and
pray
when
am
i
to
wish
you
joy
that
is
exactly
the
question
which
i
expected
you
to
ask
a
lady
s
imagination
is
very
rapid
it
jumps
from
admiration
to
love
from
love
to
matrimony
in
a
moment
i
knew
you
would
be
wishing
me
nay
if
you
are
so
serious
about
it
i
shall
consider
the
matter
as
absolutely
settled
you
will
have
a
charming
indeed
and
of
course
she
will
always
be
at
pemberley
with
the
insolence
of
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
might
be
adduced
as
a
second
example
from
the
same
book
these
people
are
well
born
and
well
bred
but
their
manners
and
conduct
are
impossible
it
may
be
alleged
that
they
were
intended
so
to
be
probably
but
that
does
not
do
away
with
the
fact
that
the
people
in
the
books
are
not
always
free
from
vulgarity
which
was
the
contention
with
which
we
started
they
might
have
been
made
disagreeable
in
a
hundred
other
ways
had
miss
austen
so
chosen
without
violating
all
ordinary
rules
of
conduct
it
is
greatly
to
the
author
s
credit
and
speaks
of
her
refinement
of
mind
that
in
an
age
when
coarseness
of
every
sort
was
rampant
her
books
should
be
free
from
a
whisper
of
it
we
of
this
present
generation
hardly
realise
how
vice
was
countenanced
in
the
days
of
the
georges
well
indeed
was
it
for
england
that
males
of
that
line
died
out
so
that
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
a
for
during
her
long
reign
the
example
which
the
court
set
and
which
the
inferiors
were
quick
to
copy
was
altered
altogether
george
the
third
himself
who
occupied
the
throne
during
the
whole
of
jane
austen
s
life
was
a
happy
exception
among
the
hanoverian
sovereigns
but
the
excesses
of
his
sons
were
notorious
even
the
duke
of
kent
the
best
of
them
accepts
a
alliance
as
inevitable
to
say
nothing
of
worse
in
writing
familiarly
to
creevey
after
the
death
of
princess
charlotte
he
the
duke
of
clarence
i
have
no
doubt
will
marry
if
he
demands
the
payment
of
all
his
debts
which
are
very
great
and
a
handsome
provision
for
his
ten
natural
only
knows
the
sacrifice
it
will
be
to
make
whenever
i
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
become
a
married
man
it
is
now
seven
and
twenty
years
that
madame
laurent
and
i
have
lived
together
we
are
of
the
same
age
have
been
in
all
climates
and
all
difficulties
together
and
you
may
well
imagine
creevey
the
pang
it
will
be
to
part
with
creevey
the
irregular
unions
of
princes
of
the
blood
are
unfortunately
an
accepted
fact
but
the
epoch
in
which
such
things
were
done
in
broad
daylight
was
one
in
which
libertinism
of
all
kinds
was
rampant
it
was
an
age
also
of
excessive
drunkenness
the
prince
regent
frequently
appeared
in
public
hardly
able
to
stand
creevey
records
that
the
prince
drank
so
much
as
to
be
made
very
seriously
ill
by
it
he
says
also
as
if
it
were
a
thing
to
wonder
at
it
is
reckoned
very
disgraceful
in
russia
for
the
higher
orders
to
be
the
books
of
smollett
and
fielding
had
inculcated
the
general
belief
that
indecency
and
interest
in
a
novel
were
inseparable
and
it
is
greatly
to
the
credit
of
miss
burney
and
miss
austen
that
their
writings
were
of
an
entirely
different
tone
sir
walter
besant
writes
i
do
not
wish
to
represent
the
eighteenth
century
as
much
worse
than
our
own
in
the
matter
of
what
is
called
morality
meaning
one
kind
of
morality
the
great
were
allowed
to
be
above
the
ordinary
restraints
of
morality
a
certain
noble
lord
travelled
with
a
harem
of
eight
which
was
however
considered
in
the
eighteenth
no
whisper
of
these
things
stains
jane
austen
s
pages
and
her
clear
unaffected
view
of
life
in
small
towns
and
villages
was
true
and
not
idealised
for
these
people
were
then
as
they
still
are
the
salt
of
the
world
neither
apeing
the
fantastic
vices
of
the
upper
nor
the
abandoned
coarseness
of
the
lower
classes
they
were
respectable
and
sometimes
humdrum
they
suffered
from
monotony
not
dissipation
that
anyone
should
have
been
able
to
extract
so
much
pure
fun
from
such
slight
materials
is
ever
matter
for
wonder
she
did
it
by
her
marvellously
close
observation
and
power
of
selection
qualities
which
are
a
gift
she
was
far
more
true
to
human
nature
than
the
superficial
reader
knows
perhaps
than
she
herself
knew
for
it
is
a
trait
of
genius
to
do
by
the
light
of
nature
what
other
people
must
set
about
laboriously
and
ever
fall
short
of
attaining
when
we
notice
bennet
s
caustic
humour
reappearing
in
more
genial
form
in
his
second
daughter
there
is
one
of
those
little
touches
that
binds
the
characters
touch
of
heredity
another
instance
is
in
the
case
of
lady
middleton
who
obviously
had
not
married
either
for
love
or
for
suitability
but
only
for
convenience
she
is
a
cold
woman
incapable
of
passion
in
the
usual
sense
but
her
nature
breaks
out
in
an
adoration
of
her
children
which
is
neither
for
their
benefit
nor
for
hers
we
see
this
again
and
again
in
real
life
it
is
the
cold
unloving
wives
who
idolise
their
children
because
they
are
theirs
a
feeling
which
is
not
real
love
but
a
kind
of
extended
selfishness
an
instinct
which
in
the
case
of
animals
finds
expression
in
licking
their
young
the
books
abound
in
similar
true
touches
put
in
apparently
without
effort
and
almost
without
thought
when
one
considers
that
out
of
the
mass
of
novels
of
that
age
then
as
now
circulated
and
read
by
the
aid
of
libraries
such
books
as
hannah
more
s
in
search
of
a
and
mackenzie
s
of
and
of
the
were
read
and
praised
almost
universally
as
being
far
superior
to
the
usual
run
of
novels
one
gains
some
idea
of
the
poverty
of
matter
and
manner
that
must
have
disgraced
the
ruck
both
these
masterpieces
so
acclaimed
as
they
were
issued
are
the
dullest
driest
stuff
without
a
gleam
of
humour
any
attempt
at
a
story
or
any
vivacity
of
expression
or
character
the
general
style
is
mr
and
are
expected
is
a
pious
virtuous
man
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
say
so
much
for
his
wife
and
thereupon
follows
a
long
verbose
description
of
the
two
who
when
they
appear
on
the
scene
do
and
say
nothing
to
indicate
any
characteristics
but
are
mere
dummies
pegs
on
which
to
hang
the
discourse
that
precedes
their
entry
a
favourite
device
for
filling
up
the
pages
that
must
be
filled
is
the
narration
by
some
secondary
character
of
all
that
has
ever
befallen
them
since
their
birth
even
miss
burney
is
not
free
from
this
in
at
least
the
characters
break
into
narration
as
easily
as
some
persons
do
into
song
with
this
kind
of
stuff
to
set
the
standard
the
miracle
of
jane
s
books
becomes
more
admirable
than
ever
for
anyone
who
has
ever
attempted
to
write
knows
how
exceedingly
difficult
it
is
to
resist
the
influence
of
the
conventional
canons
in
vogue
illustration
miss
burney
madame
d
arblay
jane
austen
seems
to
have
been
also
as
far
ahead
of
her
time
in
the
use
of
simple
direct
english
as
she
was
in
construction
and
effect
she
is
at
least
a
generation
in
advance
of
average
contemporary
letters
and
journals
in
which
the
phrasing
is
often
ponderous
the
sonorous
roll
of
sentences
in
the
johnsonian
style
then
so
much
admired
does
not
ever
seem
to
have
occurred
to
her
yet
even
in
her
lively
crisp
narration
there
are
a
few
phrases
that
strike
on
a
modern
ear
as
unaccustomed
such
is
the
use
of
the
active
for
the
passive
tense
tea
was
carrying
round
the
elision
of
the
final
n
in
the
infinitive
but
she
said
he
seemed
very
angry
at
being
spoke
to
the
use
of
adjectives
for
adverbs
often
reproved
as
a
form
of
slang
in
the
present
day
she
must
feel
she
has
been
acting
the
general
use
of
men
s
surnames
by
women
occurs
in
the
earlier
books
but
we
see
an
indication
of
change
in
this
respect
in
the
passage
of
jane
s
lifetime
for
in
it
is
considered
vulgar
of
elton
to
address
knightley
without
the
prefix
there
are
little
ways
of
expressing
things
that
are
not
now
in
vogue
men
are
gentlemanlike
ladies
amiable
also
genteel
and
elegant
one
phrase
which
has
now
descended
to
the
realm
of
the
lady
was
then
quite
good
english
so
peculiarly
the
lady
in
excessively
takes
the
place
of
our
awfully
we
hear
continually
such
expressions
as
monstrous
obliging
prodigious
pretty
and
vastly
we
have
not
hitherto
noticed
miss
edgeworth
s
miss
ferrier
s
or
miss
mitford
s
work
though
they
are
generally
considered
as
belonging
to
the
clever
group
of
women
writers
who
illumined
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
because
in
this
chapter
we
are
dealing
only
with
jane
austen
s
own
novels
not
with
contemporary
writers
except
as
they
affected
her
and
at
the
time
when
she
wrote
her
first
books
none
of
these
writers
had
published
anything
and
could
not
therefore
possibly
have
influenced
her
miss
edgeworth
s
first
novel
came
out
in
and
miss
ferrier
s
in
after
jane
was
in
her
grave
jane
austen
s
own
novels
were
written
at
such
widely
differing
times
and
the
interval
between
writing
and
publication
was
so
great
in
some
cases
that
the
subject
suffers
from
some
confusion
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
not
looked
into
the
question
closely
as
the
order
of
writing
is
everything
and
the
order
of
publication
a
mere
accident
we
will
take
them
as
they
were
written
this
was
in
two
groups
of
three
each
and
was
begun
in
october
and
finished
the
following
august
and
was
begun
in
and
finished
in
in
which
year
was
also
written
then
there
was
a
long
gap
in
which
she
produced
only
a
fragment
to
be
noted
hereafter
and
not
until
was
written
four
years
later
in
came
quickly
followed
by
of
all
these
the
first
to
be
published
was
and
in
and
the
dates
of
publication
will
thereafter
be
noted
in
chronological
order
in
the
book
as
it
progresses
besides
these
two
distinct
groups
of
three
novels
each
there
is
another
of
the
unfinished
fragments
which
never
became
real
stories
these
consist
of
a
comedy
in
the
form
of
letters
which
is
ended
up
hastily
with
a
few
paragraphs
of
explanation
and
an
unfinished
tale
of
which
the
end
was
told
by
cassandra
austen
from
remarks
that
her
sister
had
made
both
of
these
are
included
as
has
been
said
in
s
and
it
seems
a
pity
that
they
should
not
form
a
volume
in
one
of
the
neat
series
of
jane
austen
s
novels
now
published
as
to
a
real
austenite
they
contain
much
that
is
valuable
and
are
full
of
characteristic
touches
of
the
complete
novels
and
is
admittedly
the
best
there
are
several
candidates
for
the
second
place
but
the
superiority
of
and
is
unquestioned
it
was
the
earliest
of
the
books
written
under
the
title
and
as
such
it
is
referred
to
in
jane
s
correspondence
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
wanting
to
read
again
so
seldom
as
you
have
gone
through
it
and
that
so
long
ago
this
was
to
her
sister
in
and
later
on
she
adds
with
the
playfulness
never
long
wanting
i
would
not
let
martha
read
again
upon
any
account
and
am
very
glad
i
did
not
leave
it
in
your
power
she
is
very
cunning
but
i
saw
through
her
design
she
means
to
publish
it
from
memory
and
one
more
perusal
must
enable
her
to
do
there
has
been
great
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
the
relative
merit
of
the
remaining
books
but
the
concensus
of
opinion
seems
to
declare
for
the
last
but
one
in
point
of
time
which
shows
that
the
author
s
genius
had
not
abated
this
book
is
totally
different
from
the
first
it
lacks
the
sparkle
and
which
runs
all
through
and
but
it
has
perhaps
more
depth
and
is
something
softer
and
more
finished
also
these
two
books
and
all
the
others
will
be
dealt
with
in
detail
as
they
occur
chronologically
for
we
are
here
only
attempting
to
treat
them
generally
and
to
bring
out
those
characteristics
and
excellencies
common
to
all
which
made
them
such
masterpieces
and
gave
their
maker
such
a
unique
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
authors
jane
austen
is
one
of
the
three
greatest
among
english
women
novelists
the
other
two
being
of
course
george
eliot
and
charlotte
brontë
whose
lives
overlapped
at
a
much
later
date
the
genius
of
these
three
women
is
so
entirely
different
in
kind
that
the
relative
value
of
their
gifts
can
never
be
put
into
like
terms
so
long
as
men
and
women
read
and
discuss
fiction
so
long
will
each
of
the
three
styles
have
its
partisans
who
will
argue
it
to
be
the
supreme
one
of
the
trio
yet
in
spite
of
this
in
spite
also
of
a
momentary
fashion
to
decry
the
wonderful
gifts
of
george
eliot
it
is
quite
certain
that
in
depth
and
breadth
of
feeling
and
ability
in
its
portrayal
she
was
unequalled
by
either
her
predecessor
or
contemporary
her
range
far
surpasses
theirs
they
each
dealt
with
one
phase
of
life
or
feeling
jane
austen
with
english
village
life
charlotte
brontë
with
the
element
of
passion
in
man
and
woman
while
george
eliot
s
works
embrace
many
varieties
of
human
nature
and
action
if
her
detractors
are
questioned
it
will
commonly
be
found
that
they
do
not
deny
her
ability
or
her
brain
power
but
her
genius
which
is
of
course
a
totally
distinct
thing
on
further
probing
of
the
matter
it
is
usually
discovered
that
the
contention
is
based
on
the
later
works
such
as
or
to
be
quite
fair
there
are
some
appearances
in
these
volumes
to
justify
such
an
estimate
but
the
mistake
is
that
the
opinion
is
superficial
and
based
on
appearance
only
in
her
later
days
george
eliot
s
tremendous
ability
tremendous
soul
tremendous
is
the
only
english
word
that
can
be
fitly
applied
to
it
her
see
so
far
round
and
over
her
own
work
as
well
as
allowing
her
such
a
wide
survey
as
to
the
causes
and
nature
of
things
that
even
the
productions
of
her
genius
were
analysed
curbed
and
held
in
channels
she
could
not
let
herself
go
her
subtle
insight
her
complete
knowledge
of
her
characters
made
her
qualify
and
account
for
their
actions
perhaps
more
for
her
own
satisfaction
than
for
that
of
readers
she
might
safely
have
left
this
to
her
innate
perception
without
fear
her
genius
would
never
have
let
her
go
wrong
but
she
could
not
she
must
analyse
even
her
own
creations
no
one
in
the
world
was
more
free
from
this
tendency
than
jane
austen
she
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
her
own
mastery
of
her
subject
as
unconscious
as
the
bee
when
it
rejects
all
other
shapes
in
its
cells
for
the
hexagonal
the
marvellous
precision
with
which
she
selected
and
rejected
and
grouped
her
puppets
was
almost
a
matter
of
instinct
she
put
in
the
little
touches
which
revealed
what
was
in
the
mind
of
her
men
and
women
without
premeditation
or
any
striving
it
is
the
perfection
of
this
gift
which
allows
her
books
to
be
read
again
and
again
for
once
the
story
is
known
all
the
slight
indications
of
its
ultimate
ending
which
may
have
been
overlooked
while
the
reader
is
not
in
the
secret
stand
out
vividly
we
grant
to
george
eliot
s
detractors
that
in
her
later
works
her
eyes
were
opened
and
she
analysed
the
work
of
her
genius
instead
of
writing
spontaneously
but
to
her
true
admirers
the
genius
is
still
there
though
curbed
and
trammelled
every
one
of
her
men
and
women
to
the
last
are
breathing
human
beings
having
granted
however
so
much
we
turn
to
the
earlier
works
which
amazing
to
say
are
so
often
overlooked
here
her
gallery
is
full
of
realities
not
analysed
or
thwarted
but
moving
as
impelled
by
nature
was
there
ever
a
and
in
all
fiction
to
equal
tom
and
maggie
tulliver
and
what
of
that
inimitable
trio
sisters
glegg
and
tulliver
and
pullet
of
its
kind
is
there
a
scene
that
can
beat
bob
jakin
s
twisting
glegg
round
his
finger
with
judicious
management
and
these
are
from
the
abundance
of
one
book
only
no
jane
can
not
dispute
precedence
with
george
eliot
but
must
yield
the
palm
her
characters
true
and
admirable
as
they
are
lack
that
living
depth
which
george
eliot
had
the
power
to
impart
but
the
two
are
so
totally
different
that
it
is
difficult
to
find
any
simile
that
will
bring
them
into
relation
with
one
another
perhaps
the
most
expressive
is
that
of
instrumental
music
jane
austen
s
clear
notes
are
like
those
which
a
skilful
performer
extracts
from
a
good
harp
sweet
and
ringing
always
pleasant
to
listen
to
and
restful
but
not
soul
stirring
while
george
eliot
s
tones
are
like
the
deep
notes
of
a
violoncello
stirring
up
the
heart
to
its
core
and
leaving
behind
them
feeling
even
after
the
sound
has
ceased
the
novels
of
jane
austen
were
novels
of
character
and
manners
those
of
george
eliot
of
feeling
there
is
no
intention
in
this
comparison
to
minimise
in
any
way
the
work
of
the
earlier
writer
she
chose
her
style
and
of
its
kind
it
is
perfect
her
subtle
touches
could
only
have
been
the
result
of
the
intuition
which
is
genius
but
the
profounder
emotions
the
slow
development
of
character
by
friction
with
those
around
she
did
not
attempt
to
depict
we
now
turn
to
the
third
of
the
great
trio
charlotte
brontë
s
gift
was
a
rush
of
strenuous
passion
that
made
her
stories
pour
forth
living
and
molten
as
from
the
furnace
her
best
characters
are
admirable
but
limited
in
number
we
find
the
same
timid
heroine
who
outwardly
was
herself
and
inwardly
was
full
of
force
and
passion
appearing
in
more
than
one
charlotte
s
bitter
indictment
of
jane
s
work
though
wholly
untrue
can
be
made
allowance
for
seeing
that
her
eyes
viewed
such
a
different
section
of
the
world
of
feeling
she
says
of
and
an
accurate
daguerreotyped
portrait
of
a
commonplace
face
a
carefully
fenced
highly
cultured
garden
with
neat
borders
and
delicate
flowers
but
no
glance
of
a
bright
vivid
physiognomy
no
open
country
no
fresh
air
no
blue
hill
no
bonny
and
at
another
time
with
much
truth
the
passions
are
perfectly
unknown
to
her
she
rejects
even
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
that
stormy
sisterhood
what
sees
keenly
speaks
aptly
moves
flexibly
it
suits
her
to
study
but
what
throbs
fast
and
full
though
hidden
what
the
blood
rushes
through
what
is
the
unseen
seat
of
life
and
the
sentient
target
of
death
this
miss
austen
charlotte
brontë
s
own
strongest
point
is
her
and
as
the
teller
of
an
interesting
story
absorbing
in
its
wild
and
strenuous
action
she
ranks
very
high
but
is
not
her
forte
she
herself
fails
in
the
point
of
which
she
accuses
jane
she
could
photograph
those
persons
she
knew
intimately
for
instance
or
her
father
s
curates
directly
she
went
beyond
she
failed
what
could
be
weaker
than
the
society
people
in
ringletted
blanche
and
the
wooden
young
men
a
great
many
of
her
minor
characters
are
mere
dummies
who
do
not
remain
in
the
mind
at
all
but
one
of
her
strong
points
is
one
entirely
ignored
by
jane
and
that
is
the
impression
of
scenery
and
the
aspects
of
weather
which
of
us
has
not
felt
a
chill
of
desolation
as
he
stood
in
fancy
on
the
wet
leading
up
to
lowood
or
not
been
sensible
of
the
exhilaration
of
that
sharp
clear
frosty
night
when
jane
first
encountered
rochester
in
the
lane
in
a
few
words
very
few
charlotte
brontë
has
a
marvellous
capability
for
making
one
feel
the
surroundings
of
her
characters
and
this
is
no
mean
gift
adherents
she
will
always
have
and
to
them
it
may
be
granted
that
her
whole
theme
was
one
totally
ignored
by
jane
whose
men
and
women
are
swept
by
no
mighty
whirlwinds
of
their
own
generating
in
fact
it
has
been
alleged
against
jane
that
she
had
neither
passion
nor
pathos
and
perhaps
if
we
except
one
or
two
touches
of
the
latter
quality
in
dealing
with
forlorn
little
fanny
in
this
is
true
the
only
simile
that
occurs
as
suitable
to
use
in
the
comparison
between
charlotte
and
jane
is
that
the
soul
of
the
one
was
like
the
turbulent
rush
of
her
own
brown
yorkshire
streams
over
the
wild
which
pour
in
cataracts
and
shatter
themselves
on
great
grey
stones
in
a
tumultuous
frenzy
while
that
of
the
other
resembled
the
calm
limpid
waters
of
her
own
hampshire
river
the
itchen
wending
its
way
placidly
between
luscious
green
meadows
a
deeper
sky
where
stooping
you
may
see
the
little
minnows
darting
the
preference
between
these
two
is
all
a
matter
of
taste
and
will
be
decided
by
the
fact
whether
the
admiration
of
clear
incisive
humour
and
comedy
of
manners
outweighs
that
of
fiery
feeling
and
a
rush
of
emotion
chapter
vi
letters
and
post
the
main
source
of
information
about
jane
austen
is
contained
in
her
letters
the
bulk
of
those
that
have
been
preserved
are
to
be
found
in
the
two
volumes
edited
by
lord
brabourne
her
and
these
are
only
the
remnant
of
what
we
might
have
had
but
for
cassandra
s
action
it
could
not
matter
to
jane
or
cassandra
now
if
those
gay
outpourings
had
been
published
in
full
and
we
should
have
had
a
much
more
complete
and
true
picture
of
one
whom
england
holds
among
her
three
greatest
women
novelists
as
it
is
anything
based
on
these
letters
must
necessarily
be
subject
to
modification
the
inferences
drawn
are
imperfect
and
there
are
long
gaps
in
continuity
while
many
events
of
great
moment
to
the
writer
herself
are
not
so
much
as
referred
to
in
them
we
owe
it
however
to
the
fact
that
visits
then
really
were
visits
extending
over
weeks
or
months
to
compensate
for
the
difficulty
and
expense
of
travelling
that
what
remain
are
many
in
number
and
also
we
have
cause
to
be
thankful
that
on
account
of
austen
and
the
household
the
two
sisters
made
a
point
of
not
leaving
home
together
generally
taking
turns
so
that
the
letters
are
very
much
more
numerous
than
they
might
otherwise
have
been
besides
those
written
to
cassandra
there
are
a
few
given
by
lord
brabourne
which
were
written
to
his
own
mother
as
a
girl
and
these
are
by
no
means
the
least
interesting
in
the
book
a
certain
number
also
are
addressed
to
jane
s
other
niece
anna
besides
those
in
lord
brabourne
s
book
there
are
one
or
two
additional
ones
in
the
by
jane
s
own
nephew
the
first
of
the
published
letters
is
dated
the
beginning
of
when
jane
was
as
the
letters
contain
many
comments
on
dress
food
daily
occurrences
of
all
sorts
the
best
method
seems
to
be
to
use
them
as
a
thread
on
which
to
hang
notes
of
the
everyday
life
of
the
period
collating
what
the
writer
herself
says
with
what
is
otherwise
known
and
in
this
way
to
gain
a
background
against
which
her
own
figure
will
stand
out
one
great
characteristic
of
her
correspondence
is
its
extreme
liveliness
and
humour
this
is
the
more
remarkable
because
in
her
age
and
time
letters
were
with
a
few
brilliant
exceptions
ponderous
and
laboured
written
in
the
grand
style
as
was
perhaps
natural
when
the
sending
of
a
letter
was
a
serious
consideration
the
following
is
a
good
specimen
of
the
style
considered
proper
for
a
boy
of
sixteen
writing
to
his
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
be
thus
troublesome
to
you
but
i
hope
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
be
able
to
say
that
i
have
in
some
small
degree
deserved
the
many
cares
and
anxieties
i
have
cost
you
at
least
no
effort
shall
be
lost
to
attain
that
end
there
are
two
objects
virtue
and
ability
constantly
before
my
eyes
if
i
attain
them
i
know
myself
sure
of
your
approbation
in
the
possession
of
which
i
shall
be
happy
and
without
which
i
should
be
miserable
so
that
if
selfish
gratification
was
the
only
cause
i
should
proceed
in
my
grand
object
a
more
powerful
cause
however
employs
its
influence
upon
my
mind
a
desire
of
doing
good
which
can
not
operate
without
ability
can
not
have
effect
without
if
a
fond
mother
of
the
present
day
got
such
a
letter
from
a
schoolboy
son
she
would
probably
take
the
first
train
to
see
if
he
were
ill
the
same
stiffness
was
the
rule
in
intimate
family
relations
this
boy
who
was
no
peculiar
specimen
but
a
natural
boy
of
his
times
writes
about
his
little
sister
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
anna
maria
is
such
a
nice
girl
i
hope
she
is
clever
both
at
her
books
and
at
her
needle
at
the
former
i
am
sure
she
is
if
she
always
writes
such
nice
letters
as
the
last
she
sent
to
me
is
it
asking
too
much
to
beg
her
to
write
another
before
she
returns
to
kendal
how
different
these
sentences
are
from
the
lively
ones
of
jane
austen
to
her
sister
everybody
is
extremely
anxious
for
your
return
but
as
you
can
not
come
home
by
the
ashe
ball
i
am
glad
i
have
not
fed
them
with
false
hopes
james
danced
with
alithea
and
cut
up
the
turkey
last
night
with
great
perseverance
you
say
nothing
of
the
silk
stockings
i
flatter
myself
therefore
that
charles
has
not
purchased
any
as
i
can
not
very
well
afford
to
pay
for
them
we
received
a
visit
from
tom
lefroy
and
his
cousin
george
the
latter
is
really
very
well
behaved
now
and
as
for
the
other
he
has
but
one
fault
which
time
will
i
trust
entirely
remove
it
is
that
his
morning
coat
is
a
great
deal
too
and
again
i
am
very
much
flattered
by
your
commendation
of
my
last
letter
for
i
write
only
for
fame
and
without
any
view
to
pecuniary
it
was
an
age
of
letter
writing
periodicals
were
expensive
and
in
remote
districts
difficult
to
get
even
when
obtained
the
news
was
what
we
should
deem
at
the
present
time
scanty
in
the
extreme
for
instance
consisted
of
only
a
single
folded
sheet
of
which
the
front
page
was
occupied
with
advertisements
the
foreign
news
was
always
some
days
old
as
it
was
obtained
by
special
which
brought
across
the
french
papers
these
boats
being
dependent
on
the
wind
and
currents
were
subject
to
many
delays
the
newspaper
taxes
were
heavy
and
burdensome
and
though
even
the
poorest
sheet
of
news
must
be
considered
wonderful
in
view
of
the
difficulty
and
expense
attendant
on
the
procuring
of
news
in
days
the
fact
remains
that
much
was
left
out
which
could
only
be
supplied
by
private
correspondence
horace
walpole
of
course
stands
out
as
the
prince
of
of
his
time
his
published
letters
now
amount
to
over
two
thousand
and
deal
with
all
the
current
questions
of
the
day
of
course
these
letters
are
on
an
altogether
different
plane
from
the
little
batch
of
about
two
hundred
which
are
all
we
have
of
jane
s
walpole
s
letters
are
read
not
only
for
their
style
and
manner
but
for
the
light
they
throw
on
society
and
politics
jane
s
can
be
of
interest
to
none
but
those
who
are
interested
in
her
and
at
the
time
they
were
published
there
were
many
voices
raised
in
protest
against
the
publication
of
such
very
small
beer
but
in
so
far
as
they
throw
light
on
her
own
daily
life
they
are
certainly
worth
having
considered
merely
as
private
productions
it
is
wonderful
considering
the
expense
of
letter
carriage
and
the
delay
of
correspondence
that
she
wrote
so
much
as
she
did
letters
in
those
days
consisted
only
of
a
single
sheet
without
an
envelope
which
was
formed
by
the
last
page
of
the
sheet
itself
being
folded
over
and
fastened
by
a
wafer
this
did
not
leave
much
room
for
writing
jane
wrote
very
small
and
her
lines
are
neat
and
straight
so
that
she
got
the
largest
amount
possible
into
the
available
space
at
that
time
a
single
sheet
of
paper
not
exceeding
an
ounce
in
weight
varied
in
price
from
to
according
to
the
distance
it
was
carried
if
it
exceeded
an
ounce
it
was
charged
fourfold
any
additional
bit
of
paper
made
it
into
a
double
letter
which
was
charged
accordingly
but
the
thing
which
would
seem
to
us
most
intolerable
of
all
was
that
the
recipient
and
not
the
sender
paid
for
the
missive
whereby
many
modest
souls
must
have
been
prevented
from
ever
writing
to
their
friends
lest
the
letter
should
not
be
considered
worth
the
charge
not
until
long
after
jane
had
been
in
her
grave
did
adhesive
stamps
come
into
use
it
is
a
commonly
received
idea
that
the
post
office
as
an
institution
dates
from
the
establishment
of
universal
penny
post
in
the
british
isles
by
rowland
hill
in
but
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
there
was
a
postmaster
in
if
not
before
in
a
parcels
post
at
a
penny
a
pound
was
established
in
london
by
william
dockwra
who
also
suggested
passing
letters
in
london
at
the
same
rate
the
profits
of
the
at
that
time
were
by
a
most
flagrant
abuse
the
monopoly
of
the
duke
of
york
who
vehemently
resented
dockwra
s
improvements
in
spite
of
this
however
dockwra
won
his
way
the
london
letters
for
the
penny
post
were
daily
transmitted
to
lyme
street
at
the
dwelling
house
of
the
said
dockwra
formerly
the
mansion
house
of
sir
robert
abdy
kt
there
are
seven
sorting
houses
proper
to
the
seven
precincts
into
which
the
undertakers
have
divided
london
westminster
and
the
suburbs
situated
at
equal
distances
for
the
better
maintenance
of
mutual
correspondence
there
are
about
or
receiving
houses
to
take
in
letters
where
the
messengers
call
every
hour
and
convey
them
as
directed
as
also
the
writing
of
which
are
much
increased
by
this
accommodation
being
carefully
conveyed
by
them
to
the
general
post
office
in
lombard
these
post
letters
are
those
for
the
country
still
the
monopoly
of
the
duke
who
had
been
persuaded
to
yield
to
dockwra
s
scheme
as
likely
to
further
his
own
revenue
also
by
these
clerks
messengers
etc
are
conveyed
letters
and
parcels
not
exceeding
one
pound
weight
nor
ten
pound
in
value
to
and
from
all
parts
at
seasonable
times
viz
of
the
cities
of
london
and
westminster
southwark
redriff
wapping
ratcliff
limehouse
stepney
poplar
and
blackwall
and
all
other
places
within
the
weekly
bills
of
mortality
as
also
the
four
towns
of
hackney
islington
south
newington
butts
and
lambeth
but
to
no
other
towns
and
the
letters
to
be
left
only
at
the
receiving
offices
of
those
towns
or
if
brought
to
their
houses
a
penny
dockwra
not
only
carried
but
insured
letters
and
parcels
up
to
in
value
he
was
liberal
in
his
deliveries
to
the
most
remote
places
letters
go
four
or
five
times
of
the
day
to
other
places
six
or
eight
times
of
the
day
to
inns
of
court
and
places
of
business
in
town
especially
in
term
or
parliament
time
ten
or
twelve
times
of
the
stamps
were
also
used
to
mark
the
hour
when
the
letters
were
sent
out
to
be
delivered
an
item
only
recently
reintroduced
into
our
postal
service
much
wailing
was
heard
at
dockwra
s
reforms
from
the
porters
of
london
who
had
made
a
fine
living
by
carrying
correspondence
their
outcries
were
much
the
same
as
those
of
the
watermen
who
afterwards
wailed
at
the
introduction
of
hackney
coaches
dockwra
was
not
long
allowed
to
enjoy
his
idea
for
his
scheme
was
incorporated
into
the
general
post
office
though
he
afterwards
received
a
pension
of
a
year
and
was
made
comptroller
of
the
london
post
office
for
anything
outside
of
london
distance
still
counted
in
the
cost
though
we
read
in
of
that
a
penny
post
had
been
established
in
manchester
it
was
rowland
hill
who
introduced
the
universal
penny
post
in
great
britain
thus
extending
the
dockwra
idea
in
the
postal
system
was
reformed
and
improved
three
rates
were
put
in
force
namely
threepence
if
under
eighty
miles
fourpence
if
above
and
sixpence
to
edinburgh
or
dublin
this
explains
the
custom
of
carrying
letters
for
some
distance
and
then
posting
them
jane
austen
says
i
put
mary
s
letter
into
the
post
office
with
my
own
hand
at

this
was
on
the
way
to
bath
in
were
introduced
by
the
suggestion
of
ralph
allen
a
bath
postmaster
before
that
time
every
letter
had
to
go
round
by
london
to
be
cleared
even
supposing
it
to
be
intended
for
a
town
not
far
off
from
the
sender
allen
offered
to
organise
the
whole
thing
paying
a
fixed
rent
and
taking
the
profits
his
plan
succeeded
so
well
that
he
cleared
a
year
at
his
death
in
the
government
took
over
the
contract

carried
on
horseback
by
who
were
underpaid
and
undisciplined

a
boy

drunk
or
entered
into
conversation

strangers

turned
out
to
be
footpads
the
bags

reached
their
destination
in
john
palmer
manager
of

suggested
the
employment
of

time
carry
passengers
hence
the
inauguration
of
the
first

started

were
armed

if
this
did
not
altogether
ensure
the
safety
of

were
often
a
mere
farce
and
the
men

or

of

the
system
of
franking
is
one
of
those
things
that
make
us
realise
the
difference
between
the
ideas
of
our
own
time
and
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
more
than
anything
else
that
such
an
abuse
can
have
been
permitted
is
incredible
monstrous
of
course
as
it
was
in
force
everybody
availed
themselves
of
it
without
scruple
few
indeed
are
the
persons
whose
private
consciences
are
in
advance
of
public
rules
jane
writes
frequently
on
the
as
eliza
has
been
so
good
as
to
get
me
a
frank
your
questions
shall
be
answered
without
much
further
expense
to
you
on

lushington
for
canterbury
and
manager
of
the
lodge
hounds
dines
here
and
stays
the
night
if
i
can
i
will
get
a
frank
from
him
and
write
to
you
all
the
now
i
will
prepare
for
lushington
and
as
it
will
be
wisest
also
to
prepare
for
his
not
coming
or
my
not
getting
a
frank
i
shall
write
very
close
from
the
first
and
even
leave
room
for
the
seal
in
the
proper
letters
were
sent
when
franks
could
be
procured
and
when
they
could
not
silence
was
crabbe
horace
walpole
says
i
have
kept
this
letter
some
days
in
my
writing
box
till
i
could
meet
with
a
stray
member
of
parliament
for
it
is
not
worth
making
you
pay
the
franking
of
letters
as
an
institution
commenced
as
early
as
the
year
when
it
was
resolved
that
members
letters
should
come
and
go
free
during
the
sitting
of
the
house
when
the
bill
was
sent
up
to
the
lords
it
was
thrown
out
because
the
privilege
was
not
extended
to
them
when
however
the
omission
was
supplied
the
bill
passed
the
privilege
in
course
of
time
was
grossly
abused
members
signed
large
packets
of
envelopes
at
once
and
either
sold
them
or
gave
them
to
their
friends
it
was
worth
the
while
of
a
house
of
business
when
letters
cost
sixpence
apiece
to
buy
a
thousand
franks
at
fourpence
apiece
sometimes
servants
got
them
from
their
masters
and
sold
them
in
the
year
franked
letters
representing
a
year
passed
through
the
post
in
the
amount
was
actually
supposing
that
each
letter
would
have
brought
in
sixpence
to
the
post
office
this
means
nearly
letters
so
that
every
member
of
the
two
houses
would
have
signed
an
average
of
letters
a
year
it
was
then
enacted
that
no
letter
should
pass
free
unless
the
address
as
well
as
the
signature
was
in
the
member
s
handwriting
lastly
it
was
ordered
that
all
franks
should
be
sealed
and
that
they
should
be
put
into
the
post
on
the
day
of
the
date
even
with
these
precautions
the
amount
of
franks
represented
a
year
the
privilege
was
finally
abolished
with
the
great
reforms
of
it
is
needless
to
add
that
a
system
of
wholesale
forgery
had
sprung
up
long
members
of
parliament
sold
their
privileges
of
franking
sometimes
for
a
sir
walter
besant
in
the
eighteenth
in
joseph
brasbridge
s
of
it
is
mentioned
that
a
large
firm
of
drapers
used
to
buy
their
franks
from
the
poor
relations
of
s
at
shilling
the
gross
the
abuse
of
franking
was
called
in
question
at
various
dates
and
reforms
advised
in
reply
to
questions
asked
in
parliament
it
was
stated
that
various
clerks
in
government
offices
used
to
frank
to
any
only
their
own
correspondence
but
that
of
others
probably
receiving
large
sums
of
money
for
doing
so
in
fact
it
was
known
that
some
persons
whose
salaries
were
or
a
year
had
been
making
incomes
of
and
by
this
means
the
celebrated
bookseller
lackington
had
friends
in
one
of
the
offices
and
sent
his
catalogues
free
all
over
the
country
a
majority
of
twelve
decided
for
the
question
in
the
house
the
reforms
practically
meant
the
abolition
of
franks
so
far
as
private
persons
were
concerned
as
hannah
more
put
it
pitt
had
murdered
scribbling
while
speaking
of
a
friend
she
writes
she
will
generously
tell
me
she
has
postage
in
her
pocket
but
we
have
been
used
to
franks
and
besides
the
post
is
bewitched
and
charges
nobody
knows
what
for
letters
two
shillings
and
ninepence
i
think
says
she
paid
for
a
and
again
the
abolition
of
franks
is
quite
a
serious
affliction
to
me
not
that
i
shall
ever
regret
paying
the
postage
for
my
friends
letters
but
for
fear
it
should
restrain
them
from
writing
it
is
a
tax
upon
the
free
currency
of
affection
and
sentiment
and
goes
nearer
my
heart
than
the
cruel
decision
against
literary
property
did
for
that
was
only
taxing
the
manufacture
but
this
the
raw
these
remarks
were
caused
by
the
reforms
of
but
as
we
have
said
the
whole
system
of
franking
was
not
abolished
until
of
course
there
were
no
postmen
to
deliver
letters
as
they
do
now
it
was
considered
a
great
convenience
to
have
a
at
all
from
which
letters
could
be
fetched
in
horace
walpole
says
there
was
no
posthouse
at
twickenham
the
fetching
of
letters
is
one
of
the
minor
peeps
we
get
into
the
times
through
the
novels
in
when
knightley
meets
miss
fairfax
he
i
hope
you
did
not
venture
far
miss
fairfax
this
morning
or
i
am
sure
you
must
have
been
wet
we
scarcely
got
home
in
time
i
hope
you
turned
directly
i
went
only
to
the
said
she
and
reached
home
before
the
rain
was
much
it
is
my
daily
errand
i
always
fetch
the
letters
when
i
am
here
it
saves
trouble
and
is
a
something
to
get
me
out
a
walk
before
breakfast
does
me
the
has
a
great
charm
at
one
period
of
our
lives
when
you
have
lived
to
my
age
you
will
begin
to
think
letters
are
never
worth
going
through
rain
you
are
speaking
of
letters
of
business
mine
are
letters
of
i
have
often
thought
them
the
worse
of
the
two
he
replied
coolly
ah
you
are
not
serious
now
you
have
everybody
dearest
to
you
always
near
at
hand
i
probably
never
shall
again
and
therefore
until
i
have
outlived
all
my
affections
a
i
think
must
always
have
power
to
draw
me
out
in
worse
weather
than
when
we
realise
that
every
one
of
the
letters
preserved
for
us
in
lord
brabourne
s
book
must
have
cost
on
an
average
a
shilling
we
feel
more
strongly
than
before
the
tie
between
jane
and
cassandra
which
demanded
such
constant
communication
and
the
retailing
of
every
minute
affair
we
have
nothing
to
tell
us
how
letters
came
to
steventon
but
can
form
some
sort
of
conjecture
for
ourselves
there
was
of
course
no
in
such
a
minute
place
the
letters
would
arrive
at
winchester
and
from
thence
be
forwarded
by
the
basingstoke
coach
and
dropped
at
the
inn
which
stands
at
popham
lane
end
about
two
miles
away
it
would
be
almost
certainly
impossible
for
jane
to
walk
except
in
the
driest
weather
through
lanes
of
which
we
are
told
they
were
impassable
for
carriages
at
certain
seasons
and
could
only
be
traversed
on
horseback
the
would
therefore
probably
be
detailed
to
go
for
the
possibly
riding
on
one
of
the
carriage
horses
and
jane
would
wait
in
the
damp
mist
of
an
autumn
afternoon
by
the
front
door
dressed
in
a
costume
most
unsuitable
for
the
climate
according
to
our
ideas
with
thin
slippers
kept
up
by
crossed
elastic
and
long
clinging
skirts
with
bare
arms
and
only
a
dainty
chemisette
not
reaching
to
her
neck
she
would
greet
the
man
eagerly
to
see
if
there
was
a
letter
for
her
in
the
handwriting
of
her
beloved
sister
welcome
break
on
the
monotony
of
a
grey
day
when
perhaps
austen
was
in
bed
with
one
of
her
chronic
complaints
chapter
vii
society
and
the
first
of
the
published
letters
was
written
in
january
a
time
of
year
when
such
a
scene
as
that
sketched
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
must
often
have
taken
place
the
season
was
far
from
being
a
gloomy
one
however
balls
and
entertainments
were
going
on
all
round
and
the
austens
had
guests
of
their
own
also
these
were
their
cousins
the
coopers
in
regard
to
whom
lord
brabourne
who
being
himself
a
ought
to
have
known
makes
a
most
curious
blunder
in
his
notes
previous
to
the
letters
he
says
the
coopers
whose
arrival
is
expected
in
the
first
and
announced
in
the
second
letter
were
cooper
already
mentioned
as
having
married
jane
austen
s
aunt
jane
leigh
with
his
wife
and
their
two
children
edward
and
jane
of
whom
we
shall
frequently
this
was
in
but
cooper
had
died
in
he
had
held
the
livings
of
sonning
in
berkshire
and
whaddon
near
bath
contemporaneously
until
his
death
the
cooper
whom
the
austens
were
expecting
was
cooper
s
son
edward
of
whom
lord
brabourne
speaks
as
a
child
with
his
wife
and
two
small
children
edward
and
isabella
then
both
under
two
years
old
the
coopers
are
mentioned
a
great
deal
in
the
entertaining
diary
of
philip
lybbe
powys
from
which
we
have
already
quoted
for
edward
cooper
married
her
daughter
caroline
he
like
his
father
was
in
orders
and
was
at
first
a
curate
at
harpsden
under
his
grandfather
the
rev
thomas
leigh
and
was
afterwards
presented
to
the
living
of
hamstall
ridware
staffordshire
by
leigh
a
relative
of
his
mother
s
by
whom
he
was
connected
with
the
austens
austen
having
been
a
miss
leigh
on
january
jane
writes
yesterday
came
a
letter
to
my
mother
from
edward
cooper
to
announce
not
the
birth
of
a
child
but
of
a
living
for
leigh
has
begged
his
acceptance
of
the
rectory
of
hamstall
ridware
in
staffordshire
vacant
by
johnson
s
death
we
collect
from
his
letter
that
he
means
to
reside
there
the
living
is
valued
at
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
a
year
but
it
may
be
the
little
boy
mentioned
above
as
coming
with
his
parents
to
stay
at
steventon
had
been
christened
at
harpsden
church
on
december
and
henry
austen
was
one
of
the
sponsors
at
the
christening
of
another
little
cooper
named
cassandra
in
austen
stood
sponsor
jane
remarks
of
the
two
elder
children
who
came
to
steventon
the
little
boy
is
very
like
cooper
and
the
little
girl
is
to
resemble
jane
they
this
probably
gave
rise
to
lord
brabourne
s
mistake
but
in
reality
jane
austen
was
commenting
on
the
child
s
likeness
to
its
dead
grandfather
not
to
its
father
and
the
jane
the
girl
was
to
resemble
was
edward
cooper
s
sister
jane
who
became
lady
williams
and
was
killed
in
a
carriage
accident
in
even
jane
austen
s
own
nephew
does
not
seem
to
have
realised
cooper
s
plurality
of
livings
for
he
says
the
family
lived
in
close
intimacy
with
two
cousins
edward
and
jane
cooper
the
children
of
austen
s
eldest
sister
and
cooper
the
vicar
of
sonning
near
reading
the
coopers
lived
for
some
years
at
bath
which
seems
to
have
been
much
frequented
in
those
days
by
clergymen
retiring
from
work
i
believe
that
cassandra
and
jane
sometimes
visited
them
there
and
that
jane
thus
acquired
the
intimate
knowledge
of
the
topography
and
customs
of
bath
which
enabled
her
to
write
long
before
she
resided
there
the
inference
is
not
quite
true
for
if
this
had
been
so
she
must
have
acquired
that
knowledge
before
her
seventeenth
year
for
she
was
that
age
when
her
uncle
cooper
died
and
it
is
probable
that
her
aunt
had
predeceased
him
as
she
is
never
mentioned
at
all
by
lybbe
powys
who
relates
a
tour
she
made
with
him
his
son
and
daughter
to
the
isle
of
wight
but
there
is
no
need
for
any
inference
of
the
sort
at
all
for
jane
had
another
uncle
and
aunt
and
mother
s
brother
having
adopted
the
additional
name
of
sometimes
resided
at
bath
and
it
is
obviously
to
an
invitation
from
this
aunt
she
refers
in
a
letter
of
as
we
have
said
it
was
the
season
of
balls
at
steventon
quiet
as
the
rectory
was
there
were
many
large
houses
of
the
country
gentry
around
in
various
directions
and
entertainments
of
all
sorts
were
then
perhaps
even
more
in
fashion
than
now
to
all
of
these
the
rectory
party
received
invitations
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
first
letter
jane
says
we
had
an
exceeding
good
ball
last
night
and
later
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
how
my
irish
friend
and
i
behaved
imagine
to
yourself
everything
most
profligate
and
shocking
in
the
way
of
dancing
and
sitting
down
together
we
had
a
very
good
supper
and
the
greenhouse
was
illuminated
in
a
very
elegant
in
another
letter
written
later
she
gives
the
following
account
of
a
ball
we
were
very
well
entertained
and
could
have
stayed
longer
but
for
the
arrival
of
my
list
shoes
to
convey
me
home
and
i
did
not
like
to
keep
them
waiting
in
the
cold
the
room
was
tolerable
full
and
the
ball
opened
by
miss
glyn
the
miss
lances
had
partners
captain
dauvergne
s
friend
appeared
in
regimentals
caroline
maitland
had
an
officer
to
flirt
with
and
john
harrison
was
deputed
by
captain
smith
himself
being
absent
to
ask
me
to
dance
everything
went
well
you
see
especially
after
we
had
tucked
lance
s
neckerchief
in
behind
and
fastened
it
with
a
says
there
must
have
been
more
dancing
throughout
the
country
in
those
days
than
there
is
now
and
it
seems
to
have
sprung
up
more
spontaneously
as
if
it
were
a
natural
production
with
less
fastidiousness
as
to
the
quality
of
music
lights
and
floor
many
country
towns
had
a
monthly
ball
throughout
the
winter
in
some
of
which
the
same
apartment
served
for
dancing
and
people
in
the
country
were
then
more
dependent
on
each
other
for
entertainment
there
was
no
looking
upon
the
london
season
as
a
necessity
and
people
could
not
rush
about
from
one
end
of
england
to
another
for
a
night
or
two
as
they
now
do
during
the
long
winter
months
when
the
bitter
cold
and
the
cumbersome
methods
of
travelling
made
any
journey
out
of
the
question
for
most
to
say
nothing
of
the
expense
balls
for
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
steventon
were
frequently
given
and
jane
and
cassandra
austen
had
their
full
share
and
seem
to
have
most
heartily
enjoyed
it
jane
herself
evidently
loved
dancing
balls
are
frequently
mentioned
in
her
novels
and
the
actual
dancing
itself
even
without
its
enjoyable
concomitant
of
flirtation
seems
to
have
attracted
her
customs
however
then
differed
very
much
from
those
that
now
reign
in
ballrooms
in
one
way
everything
was
more
formal
in
another
more
simple
the
music
the
wines
and
the
floor
were
less
considered
young
people
got
up
an
impromptu
dance
in
a
very
easily
and
the
champagne
without
which
no
one
would
dare
to
ask
their
friends
to
a
dance
now
was
then
not
considered
necessary
on
the
other
hand
the
actual
performance
was
more
formal
there
were
no
romps
at
lancers
no
round
dances
such
as
waltzes
at
all
waltzes
did
not
begin
to
be
danced
generally
until
and
the
polka
not
until
in
the
beginning
of
when
the
waltz
was
just
coming
into
fashion
miss
mitford
declaims
against
it
and
calls
it
this
detestable
in
addition
to
the
obvious
reasons
which
all
women
ought
to
have
for
disliking
it
i
can
not
perceive
its
much
vaunted
graces
what
beauty
can
there
be
in
a
series
of
dizzying
evolutions
of
which
the
wearisome
monotony
banishes
all
the
tricksy
fancies
of
the
poetry
of
motion
and
conveys
to
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
the
idea
of
a
parcel
of
teetotums
set
for
their
amusement
in
jane
s
time
minuets
cotillions
were
the
staple
of
the
programme
and
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
country
dances
no
doubt
danced
with
much
precision
and
elegance
deportment
was
then
a
necessary
part
of
the
curriculum
at
every
girls
and
the
ways
of
getting
in
and
out
of
a
carriage
and
much
more
of
bowing
and
entering
a
reception
room
were
all
taught
as
if
the
performer
were
to
go
upon
the
stage
every
motion
was
regulated
it
is
true
that
the
custom
so
aptly
illustrated
in
when
the
lady
was
forced
by
politeness
to
accept
the
first
man
who
asked
her
and
to
remain
his
partner
for
the
evening
a
custom
that
must
have
been
responsible
for
many
sore
hearts
and
spoiled
evenings
had
gone
out
in
jane
s
time
but
it
was
the
fashion
at
what
were
called
private
dances
for
any
man
to
ask
any
girl
he
fancied
to
become
his
partner
without
previous
introduction
at
public
balls
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
did
the
introducing
in
evelina
s
time
girls
must
have
had
many
an
exciting
evening
many
an
anguished
moment
when
the
wrong
man
asked
the
honour
of
their
hand
while
the
right
man
had
not
come
forward
evelina
made
a
terrible
mess
of
things
at
her
first
dance
she
refused
the
ridiculous
little
fop
who
first
approached
her
and
afterwards
accepted
the
handsome
and
engaging
lord
orville
who
it
must
be
confessed
is
a
far
superior
man
to
miss
austen
s
corresponding
hero
darcy
evelina
narrates
her
acceptance
of
him
in
a
letter
to
her
well
i
bowed
and
i
am
sure
i
coloured
for
indeed
i
was
frightened
at
the
thoughts
of
dancing
before
so
many
people
all
strangers
and
which
was
worse
with
a
stranger
however
that
was
unavoidable
for
though
i
looked
round
the
room
several
times
i
could
not
see
one
person
that
i
knew
and
so
he
took
my
hand
and
led
me
to
join
in
the
of
course
the
fop
was
not
one
to
take
this
considered
insult
quietly
he
approached
when
evelina
and
lord
orville
were
sitting
out
between
the
dances
and
asked
may
i
know
to
what
accident
i
must
attribute
not
having
the
honour
of
your
hand
accident
sir
repeated
i
much
astonished
yes
accident
madam
must
take
the
liberty
to
me
madam
ought
to
be
no
common
should
tempt
a
young
a
one
too
be
guilty
of
a
confused
idea
now
for
the
first
time
entered
my
head
of
something
i
had
heard
of
the
rules
of
an
assembly
but
i
was
never
at
one
have
only
danced
at
so
giddy
and
heedless
i
was
that
i
had
not
once
considered
the
impropriety
of
refusing
one
partner
and
afterwards
accepting
another
i
was
thunderstruck
at
the
recollection
i
afterwards
told
mirvan
of
my
disasters
and
she
blamed
herself
for
not
having
better
instructed
me
but
she
said
she
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
must
know
such
common
there
is
no
trace
of
such
a
custom
in
jane
s
times
her
partners
were
always
numerous
at
the
dances
at
basingstoke
or
in
the
neighbourhood
she
probably
knew
almost
everyone
in
the
room
on
familiar
terms
and
she
frequently
had
a
brother
with
her
to
counterbalance
the
brothers
of
her
girl
friends
she
danced
well
with
vivacity
and
grace
we
can
imagine
her
appearance
without
difficulty
her
hair
encircled
by
some
neat
bandeau
or
coquettish
bow
her
simple
frock
of
soft
white
muslin
her
curls
escaping
in
little
ringlets
on
forehead
and
shoulders
her
hazel
eyes
dancing
as
she
parried
the
conversational
thrusts
of
some
too
bold
admirer
even
as
her
own
elizabeth
bennet
might
have
done
she
certainly
must
have
been
popular
a
girl
who
can
talk
wittily
dance
well
and
who
is
bright
and
must
always
be
in
demand
and
all
the
time
her
mind
half
unconsciously
was
storing
up
the
little
words
and
gestures
of
the
persons
around
everything
that
was
significant
everything
that
was
amusing
was
noted
and
from
this
storehouse
she
was
to
draw
many
a
scene
to
delight
unnumbered
people
yet
unborn
in
her
time
the
acceptance
of
a
dance
still
carried
with
it
two
dances
or
the
twice
going
up
and
down
in
the
minuet
foolish
bennet
overflowing
with
the
events
of
the
evening
on
her
return
from
the
ball
with
her
daughters
thus
pours
out
her
soul
to
her
satirical
jane
was
so
admired
nothing
could
be
like
it
everybody
said
how
well
she
looked
and
bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful
and
danced
with
her
twice
only
think
of
that
my
dear
he
actually
danced
with
her
twice
and
she
was
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
asked
a
second
time
first
of
all
he
asked
miss
lucas
i
was
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
up
with
her
however
he
did
not
admire
her
at
all
indeed
nobody
can
you
know
and
he
seemed
quite
struck
with
jane
as
she
was
going
down
the
dance
so
he
inquired
who
she
was
and
got
introduced
and
asked
her
for
the
two
next
then
the
two
third
he
danced
with
miss
king
and
the
two
fourth
with
maria
lucas
and
the
two
fifth
with
jane
again
and
the
two
sixth
with
lizzy
and
at
another
ball
poor
elizabeth
has
collins
for
a
the
first
two
dances
however
brought
a
return
of
distress
they
were
dances
of
mortification
collins
awkward
and
solemn
apologising
instead
of
attending
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
of
it
gave
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dances
can
in
the
hero
and
heroine
first
meet
in
the
lower
rooms
at
bath
at
a
ball
where
they
are
introduced
by
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
but
the
subject
of
bath
is
such
an
engrossing
one
that
it
must
be
treated
separately
in
another
chapter
in
public
ballrooms
gentlemen
wore
swords
and
ladies
carried
enormous
fans
it
must
have
required
some
practice
to
manage
these
respective
weapons
in
a
crowded
room
says
in
a
note
old
gentlemen
who
had
survived
the
fashion
of
wearing
swords
were
known
to
regret
the
disuse
of
that
custom
because
it
put
an
end
to
one
way
of
distinguishing
those
who
had
from
those
who
had
not
been
used
to
good
society
to
wear
the
sword
easily
was
an
art
which
like
swimming
or
skating
required
to
be
learned
in
as
to
the
costumes
worn
we
get
an
idea
of
catherine
morland
s
dress
in
her
partner
s
jocose
remark
describing
the
sprigged
muslin
robe
with
blue
black
a
few
of
the
fashions
we
learn
from
contemporary
newspapers
which
thus
filled
their
columns
when
foreign
news
was
scarce
remarks
facetiously
had
not
learnt
to
take
its
high
office
seriously
in
those
days
we
are
very
happy
to
see
the
waists
of
our
fair
countrywomen
walking
downwards
by
degrees
towards
the
hip
but
as
we
are
a
little
acquainted
with
the
laws
of
increasing
velocity
in
fashionable
gravitation
we
venture
to
express
thus
early
in
their
descent
a
hope
that
they
will
stop
april
about
this
time
fashion
required
ladies
to
wear
an
enormous
pyramid
of
feathers
on
their
heads
and
many
were
the
jests
made
about
this
extraordinary
whim
of
at
all
elegant
assemblies
there
is
a
room
set
apart
for
the
lady
visitants
to
put
their
feathers
on
as
it
is
impossible
to
wear
them
in
any
carriage
with
a
top
to
it
the
lustres
are
also
removed
on
this
account
and
the
doors
are
carried
up
to
the
ceiling
a
lady
who
nods
with
dexterity
can
give
a
friend
a
little
tap
upon
the
shoulder
across
the
room
without
incommoding
the
dancers
the
ladies
feathers
are
now
generally
carried
in
the
sword
case
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
december
with
the
soft
light
of
wax
nowadays
sometimes
preferred
to
modern
on
the
long
clinging
muslin
dresses
the
arch
and
nodding
plumes
the
swords
and
the
fans
a
must
have
presented
a
most
animated
spectacle
added
to
which
the
dress
of
the
gentlemen
was
certainly
far
more
picturesque
and
becoming
than
that
of
the
present
day
the
gay
satin
coats
and
ruffles
the
and
silk
stockings
must
greatly
have
enlivened
the
scene
the
subject
of
dress
is
too
large
to
be
treated
in
the
middle
of
such
a
chapter
but
to
gain
any
idea
of
the
balls
which
gave
jane
austen
so
much
entertainment
these
things
must
be
at
least
indicated
apropos
of
the
minuet
says
it
was
not
everyone
who
felt
qualified
to
make
this
public
exhibition
and
i
have
been
told
that
those
ladies
who
intended
to
dance
minuets
used
to
distinguish
themselves
from
others
by
wearing
a
particular
kind
of
lappet
on
their
headdress
i
have
heard
also
of
another
curious
proof
of
the
respect
in
which
this
dance
was
held
gloves
immaculately
clean
were
considered
requisite
for
its
due
performance
while
gloves
a
little
soiled
were
thought
good
enough
for
a
country
dance
and
accordingly
some
prudent
ladies
provided
themselves
with
two
pairs
for
their
several
the
lady
of
the
greatest
distinction
in
the
room
was
chosen
to
open
the
ball
modest
fanny
in
was
quite
overwhelmed
when
she
discovered
that
she
was
expected
to
do
this
in
the
absence
of
her
cousins
by
taking
the
first
part
in
the
minuet
an
idea
that
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
she
found
herself
the
next
moment
conducted
to
the
top
of
the
room
and
standing
there
to
be
joined
by
the
rest
of
the
dancers
couple
after
couple
as
they
were
formed
the
ball
began
it
was
rather
honour
than
happiness
to
fanny
for
the
first
dance
at
least
her
partner
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
tried
to
impart
them
to
her
but
she
was
a
great
deal
too
much
frightened
to
have
any
enjoyment
till
she
could
suppose
herself
no
longer
looked
at
balls
there
was
generally
a
room
set
aside
for
the
older
people
who
preferred
to
play
cards
lybbe
powys
in
gives
an
account
of
a
fashionable
evening
no
minuets
that
night
it
would
have
been
difficult
without
a
master
of
ceremonies
among
so
many
people
of
rank
two
the
and
the
latter
looked
so
elegant
lighted
up
two
tables
at
loo
one
quinze
one
many
whist
at
one
of
the
former
large
sums
passed
and
repassed
i
saw
one
lady
of
quality
borrow
ten
pieces
of
tessier
within
half
an
hour
after
she
sat
down
to
and
a
countess
at
loo
who
owed
to
every
soul
round
the
table
before
half
the
night
was
over
the
orgeat
lemonade
capillaire
and
red
and
white
negus
with
cakes
were
carried
round
the
whole
evening
at
half
an
hour
after
twelve
the
supper
was
announced
and
the
hall
doors
thrown
open
on
entering
which
nothing
could
be
more
striking
as
you
know
tis
so
fine
a
one
and
was
then
illuminated
by
three
hundred
coloured
lamps
round
the
six
doors
over
the
chimney
and
over
the
statue
at
the
other
end
the
tables
had
a
most
pleasing
effect
ornamented
with
everything
in
the
confectionery
way
and
festoons
and
wreaths
of
artificial
flowers
prettily
disposed
all
fruits
of
the
season
as
grapes
pines
fine
sat
down
to
supper
the
once
so
beautiful
lady
almeria
i
think
is
vastly
altered
she
and
lady
harriot
herbert
had
the
new
trimmings
very
like
bell
ropes
with
their
tassels
and
seemingly
very
inconvenient
in
dancing
after
supper
they
returned
to
dancing
chiefly
then
cotillions
till
near
cotillions
were
later
replaced
by
quadrilles
in
jane
writes
to
her
niece
much
obliged
for
the
quadrilles
which
i
am
grown
to
think
pretty
enough
though
of
course
they
are
very
inferior
to
the
cotillions
of
my
own
but
balls
were
not
the
only
recreations
jane
and
cassandra
had
people
were
very
sociable
in
those
days
the
sketch
of
sir
john
middleton
s
horror
of
being
alone
and
his
delight
at
gathering
together
in
his
house
all
the
acquaintances
whom
he
could
persuade
to
come
is
only
slightly
exaggerated
from
the
prevailing
spirit
of
his
times
people
were
always
running
over
to
see
each
other
always
spending
long
days
at
each
other
s
houses
hospitality
was
taken
for
granted
and
was
too
common
to
be
reckoned
a
virtue
jane
and
cassandra
in
this
way
were
continually
in
touch
with
their
nearest
neighbours
at
deane
and
ashe
it
is
impossible
to
resist
quoting
the
following
malevolent
description
of
jane
austen
so
unlike
anything
we
know
of
her
it
was
given
to
miss
mitford
by
a
lady
who
it
is
admitted
had
every
reason
to
dislike
the
austens
for
her
was
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
with
edward
austen
knight
trying
to
get
away
from
him
one
of
his
estates
this
lady
says
that
jane
had
stiffened
into
the
most
perpendicular
precise
taciturn
piece
of
single
blessedness
that
ever
existed
and
that
till
and
showed
what
a
precious
gem
was
hidden
in
that
unbending
case
she
was
no
more
regarded
in
society
than
a
poker
or
a
fire
screen
or
any
other
thin
upright
piece
of
wood
or
iron
that
fills
its
corner
in
peace
and
quietness
the
case
is
very
different
now
she
is
a
poker
but
a
poker
of
whom
everyone
is
and
mitford
professes
to
recollect
jane
in
girlhood
as
being
the
prettiest
silliest
most
affected
husband
hunting
butterfly
she
ever
remembers
the
whole
tone
of
jane
s
own
writings
and
letters
redeems
her
memory
from
any
possible
reproach
of
affectation
and
the
evidence
all
points
to
the
fact
that
though
not
averse
from
a
flirtation
she
was
the
very
last
of
all
girls
to
desire
a
husband
but
it
is
of
interest
to
record
contemporary
impressions
so
as
to
show
both
sides
of
the
shield
the
first
of
the
letters
in
lord
brabourne
s
book
contains
suggestions
of
a
subject
much
more
interesting
than
mere
dancing
or
visiting
in
the
case
of
an
author
like
jane
austen
who
has
become
the
world
s
property
it
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
concealment
of
those
affairs
of
the
heart
usually
reserved
for
private
confidence
only
to
fail
in
discussing
such
a
point
would
be
to
leave
aside
a
whole
aspect
of
her
life
and
books
jane
must
have
been
admired
her
vivacity
her
wit
her
gaiety
of
heart
her
pleasant
person
and
her
keen
enjoyment
of
life
must
have
attracted
attention
we
know
definitely
she
had
at
least
two
eligible
offers
and
probably
others
as
she
was
the
very
last
person
to
boast
of
such
things
openly
it
has
sometimes
happened
that
those
most
worth
having
have
lived
and
died
single
for
they
are
too
fastidious
too
difficult
to
please
to
mate
readily
while
a
commonplace
girl
is
made
happy
by
the
addresses
of
any
ordinary
man
and
gladly
persuades
herself
to
be
in
love
jane
who
had
a
peculiar
and
deep
knowledge
of
character
could
not
be
easily
blinded
she
would
have
required
much
in
a
man
and
men
no
doubt
instinctively
knew
it
her
tongue
we
know
was
sharp
she
had
a
knack
of
saying
sharp
things
and
those
who
did
not
know
her
well
may
have
been
uneasy
under
her
penetrating
insight
those
who
did
know
her
may
have
gathered
from
her
perfectly
spontaneous
manner
and
absence
of
any
affectation
that
she
was
entirely
heart
whole
and
been
thus
discouraged
from
trying
their
fate
the
extract
naming
her
irish
friend
has
already
been
quoted
this
referred
to
the
late
lord
chief
justice
of
ireland
at
that
time
only
tom
lefroy
whose
uncle
was
rector
of
ashe
adjoining
deane
and
with
whom
jane
seems
to
have
carried
on
a
lively
flirtation
after
telling
cassandra
how
much
she
had
danced
with
him
she
adds
i
can
expose
myself
however
only
once
more
because
he
leaves
the
country
soon
after
next
friday
on
which
day
we
are
to
have
a
dance
at
ashe
after
all
he
is
a
very
gentlemanlike
good
looking
pleasant
young
man
i
assure
you
but
as
to
our
having
ever
met
except
at
the
three
last
balls
i
can
not
say
much
for
he
is
so
excessively
laughed
at
about
me
at
ashe
that
he
is
ashamed
of
coming
to
steventon
and
ran
away
when
we
called
on
lefroy
a
few
days
ago
after
i
had
written
the
above
we
received
a
visit
from
tom
lefroy
and
his
cousin
i
mean
to
confine
myself
in
future
to
tom
lefroy
for
whom
i
don
t
care
at
length
the
day
is
come
on
which
i
am
to
flirt
my
last
with
tom
lefroy
and
when
you
receive
this
it
will
be
over
my
tears
flow
as
i
write
at
the
melancholy
at
this
time
she
was
and
he
but
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
of
such
susceptible
dispositions
as
many
young
men
and
women
of
their
age
we
hear
of
lefroy
again
in
when
his
aunt
has
been
calling
at
steventon
the
reference
is
a
little
perplexing
jane
says
first
speaking
of
lefroy
of
her
nephew
she
said
nothing
at
all
and
of
her
friend
very
little
and
a
few
sentences
further
on
remarks
she
showed
me
a
letter
which
she
had
received
from
her
friend
a
few
weeks
ago
toward
the
end
of
which
is
a
sentence
to
this
effect
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
of
austen
s
illness
it
would
give
me
particular
pleasure
to
have
an
opportunity
of
improving
my
acquaintance
with
that
the
hope
of
creating
to
myself
a
nearer
interest
but
at
present
i
can
not
indulge
any
expectation
of
this
is
rational
enough
there
is
less
love
and
more
sense
in
it
than
sometimes
appeared
before
and
i
am
very
well
satisfied
it
will
go
on
exceedingly
well
and
decline
away
in
a
very
reasonable
manner
there
seems
to
be
no
likelihood
of
his
coming
into
hampshire
this
christmas
and
it
is
therefore
most
probable
that
our
indifference
will
soon
be
mutual
unless
his
regard
which
appeared
to
spring
from
knowing
nothing
of
me
at
first
is
best
supported
by
never
seeing
it
seems
evident
therefore
that
some
friend
who
had
been
staying
at
ashe
previously
had
also
shown
symptoms
of
losing
his
heart
to
jane
who
did
not
take
his
affection
seriously
and
was
in
no
danger
of
losing
her
own
her
prediction
seems
to
have
been
verified
for
we
never
hear
of
him
again
unless
he
was
the
man
to
whom
refers
when
he
in
her
youth
she
had
declined
the
addresses
of
a
gentleman
who
had
the
recommendations
of
good
character
and
connections
and
position
of
life
of
everything
in
fact
except
the
subtle
power
of
touching
her
the
other
offer
above
referred
to
was
made
to
her
in
by
someone
described
by
her
niece
anna
as
a
sensible
pleasant
man
but
he
also
failed
in
the
essential
particular
tells
us
further
of
one
passage
of
romance
in
her
history
with
which
i
am
imperfectly
acquainted
and
to
which
i
am
unable
to
assign
name
or
date
or
place
though
i
have
it
on
sufficient
authority
many
years
after
her
death
some
circumstances
induced
her
sister
cassandra
to
break
through
her
habitual
reticence
and
to
speak
of
it
she
said
that
while
staying
at
some
seaside
place
they
became
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
whose
charm
of
person
mind
and
manners
was
such
that
cassandra
thought
him
worthy
to
possess
and
likely
to
win
her
sister
s
love
when
they
parted
he
expressed
his
intention
of
soon
seeing
them
again
and
cassandra
felt
no
doubt
as
to
his
motives
but
they
never
again
met
within
a
short
time
they
heard
of
his
sudden
this
incident
may
seem
too
slight
and
unimportant
even
for
reference
but
in
reality
it
may
have
had
a
deep
significance
those
who
have
studied
human
nature
know
that
there
are
here
and
there
among
both
men
and
women
minds
that
are
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
the
best
a
temperament
like
jane
austen
s
where
the
whole
nature
was
extremely
sensitive
and
the
mind
extremely
would
have
required
qualities
of
the
heart
and
mind
in
a
man
to
be
loved
that
are
not
to
be
found
every
day
in
addition
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
her
to
marry
any
man
from
respect
only
or
simple
friendship
nothing
but
love
could
have
carried
her
fastidious
nature
over
the
bound
of
matrimony
such
natures
as
jane
s
are
not
facile
not
for
them
the
willing
which
imagines
love
in
any
man
who
is
an
admirer
not
for
them
the
blindness
which
attributes
qualities
where
they
are
not
nor
the
vanity
which
credits
a
man
with
every
virtue
merely
because
he
has
the
taste
to
prefer
them
many
marriages
are
made
on
these
lines
and
a
proportion
turn
out
well
but
the
higher
natures
standing
out
here
and
there
require
a
sounder
basis
the
incident
above
described
is
attributed
by
her
niece
anna
lefroy
writing
many
years
later
to
the
year
or
when
jane
was
on
a
tour
in
devonshire
with
her
mother
and
sister
and
other
writers
have
drawn
from
it
the
inference
that
from
this
heart
distress
came
the
inability
to
create
and
that
it
thus
accounted
for
the
long
interval
during
which
she
wrote
nothing
at
all
this
hardly
seems
likely
or
at
all
events
there
were
many
other
causes
equally
likely
such
as
the
impossibility
of
getting
her
mss
published
which
may
have
militated
against
her
adding
to
them
and
her
own
father
s
death
may
have
been
a
shock
from
which
she
was
slow
to
recover
there
is
a
cryptic
sentence
in
the
correspondence
of
which
seems
to
show
that
her
heart
was
at
that
time
touched
and
that
she
expected
to
meet
someone
who
was
an
object
of
great
interest
to
her
she
was
then
staying
at
godmersham
and
i
have
been
so
kindly
pressed
to
stay
longer
here
in
consequence
of
an
offer
of
henry
s
to
take
me
back
some
time
in
september
that
not
being
able
to
detail
all
my
objections
to
such
a
plan
i
have
felt
myself
obliged
to
give
edward
and
elizabeth
one
private
reason
for
my
wishing
to
be
at
home
in
july
they
feel
the
strength
of
it
and
say
no
more
and
one
can
rely
on
their
secrecy
after
this
i
hope
we
shall
not
be
disappointed
of
our
friend
s
visit
my
honour
as
well
as
my
affection
will
be
concerned
in
if
these
words
had
occurred
some
years
earlier
they
would
seem
to
point
directly
to
that
visitor
whose
coming
was
hindered
by
death
but
according
to
the
niece
s
account
they
must
have
been
written
too
long
after
this
incident
to
have
any
bearing
upon
it
it
may
be
however
that
anna
being
young
at
the
time
and
knowing
of
the
affair
only
by
hearsay
was
mistaken
and
in
any
case
she
does
not
authoritatively
state
the
year
as
but
believes
it
to
have
been
about
then
if
however
the
first
meeting
had
taken
place
in
or
this
remark
of
jane
s
might
allude
to
it
for
no
one
says
that
the
death
of
the
man
in
question
took
place
immediately
after
she
knew
him
but
only
before
there
was
a
second
meeting
jane
s
own
words
my
honour
as
well
as
my
affection
point
directly
to
some
admirer
for
she
would
feel
that
once
having
betrayed
her
own
eagerness
to
her
brother
and
the
fact
of
the
visitor
s
not
taking
the
trouble
to
come
to
see
her
would
appear
to
them
a
direct
slight
the
reference
can
hardly
have
been
to
anything
but
a
and
her
own
eagerness
looks
as
if
she
were
in
earnest
at
last
if
the
words
can
not
be
taken
to
refer
to
the
known
admirer
they
must
certainly
have
referred
to
some
other
and
as
nothing
more
is
heard
of
him
perhaps
he
did
not
come
as
she
anticipated
and
she
who
had
found
it
so
difficult
to
take
the
proposals
of
others
seriously
was
herself
mistaken
when
she
was
in
earnest
but
all
this
is
mere
conjecture
sir
walter
scott
in
his
review
of
in
the
finds
generally
in
jane
austen
s
books
a
deficiency
of
what
he
considers
romance
and
he
thus
indicts
one
word
however
we
must
say
in
behalf
of
that
once
powerful
divinity
cupid
king
of
gods
and
men
who
in
these
times
of
revolution
has
been
assailed
even
in
his
own
kingdom
of
romance
by
the
authors
who
were
formerly
his
devoted
priests
we
are
quite
aware
that
there
are
few
instances
of
first
attachment
being
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
and
that
it
seldom
can
be
so
in
a
state
of
society
so
highly
advanced
as
to
render
early
marriages
among
the
better
classes
acts
generally
speaking
of
imprudence
but
the
youth
of
this
realm
need
not
at
present
be
taught
the
doctrines
of
selfishness
it
is
by
no
means
their
error
to
give
the
world
or
the
good
things
of
the
world
all
for
love
and
before
the
authors
of
moral
fiction
couple
cupid
indivisibly
with
calculating
prudence
we
would
have
them
reflect
that
they
may
sometimes
lend
their
aid
to
substitute
more
mean
more
sordid
and
more
selfish
motives
of
conduct
for
the
romantic
feelings
which
their
predecessors
perhaps
fanned
into
too
powerful
a
flame
who
is
it
that
in
his
youth
has
felt
a
virtuous
attachment
however
romantic
or
however
unfortunate
but
can
trace
back
to
its
influence
much
that
his
character
may
possess
of
what
is
honourable
dignified
and
disinterested
with
due
deference
to
the
opinion
of
the
greatest
romancer
in
english
fiction
he
begs
the
question
when
he
inserts
the
words
however
an
unfortunate
in
youth
exercises
without
doubt
a
lasting
good
effect
on
any
man
who
has
grit
in
him
it
is
the
fortunate
ones
that
paradoxically
are
often
so
unfortunate
perhaps
no
word
in
the
english
language
has
ever
been
misused
like
poor
romance
jane
was
not
devoid
of
it
in
almost
every
case
she
distinguishes
between
the
real
and
the
false
marianne
s
silly
girlish
admiration
for
willoughby
and
emma
s
purely
imaginary
inclination
toward
frank
churchill
are
alike
shown
to
be
false
and
founded
only
on
that
fleeting
attraction
which
both
men
and
women
in
early
youth
feel
for
the
admirable
person
of
one
of
the
opposite
sex
there
are
many
persons
still
who
think
that
this
first
flush
of
passion
is
real
romance
that
a
young
man
who
at
the
most
susceptible
moment
of
his
life
sees
a
pretty
face
and
falls
a
victim
to
it
perhaps
even
without
ever
having
spoken
to
its
possessor
has
struck
the
real
thing
this
is
to
put
love
on
the
lowest
basis
of
animalism
the
beautiful
girl
whatever
the
nature
that
lies
beneath
is
sought
by
a
score
of
young
men
purely
because
she
arouses
in
them
their
first
instincts
of
manhood
but
perhaps
to
no
one
of
them
is
she
the
real
mate
love
that
true
deep
attraction
of
the
heart
and
mind
does
not
come
so
readily
nor
is
it
induced
by
personal
attractions
without
further
knowledge
though
it
may
well
be
enhanced
by
them
many
and
many
a
man
takes
a
rash
step
into
marriage
solely
on
the
ground
of
external
attraction
to
gratify
a
youthful
impulse
and
having
himself
fitted
the
harness
to
his
shoulders
spends
the
rest
of
his
life
in
accommodating
himself
to
it
without
making
the
process
of
accommodation
too
patent
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
if
he
be
a
man
at
all
he
realises
that
it
was
his
own
doing
entirely
and
he
must
bear
the
responsibility
such
marriages
may
if
the
two
be
malleable
and
adaptable
turn
out
happily
enough
especially
if
as
does
sometimes
happen
love
comes
after
marriage
but
the
risk
is
a
terrible
one
to
take
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
is
the
most
urgent
necessity
so
nature
takes
care
to
secure
it
at
all
risks
to
the
happiness
of
individuals
and
certainly
were
it
not
for
the
indulgence
of
this
momentary
madness
of
youth
which
oddly
enough
sir
walter
seems
to
regard
as
a
form
of
unselfishness
the
world
would
have
fewer
married
couples
in
it
when
jane
depicted
the
slow
growth
of
emma
s
love
for
knightley
she
drew
wisely
lord
brabourne
has
remarked
that
he
wished
emma
had
married
frank
churchill
and
herein
he
shows
his
own
superficial
view
of
human
nature
emma
was
a
strong
character
strongly
developed
she
must
either
have
married
for
her
own
happiness
a
man
who
was
her
master
or
one
whom
she
could
completely
guide
the
world
usually
accords
the
latter
kind
of
marriage
to
such
natures
and
in
the
character
of
elinor
dashwood
who
in
some
ways
resembles
emma
we
see
this
alternative
match
for
she
marries
the
hopelessly
weak
edward
ferrars
but
emma
s
was
the
better
match
for
many
a
man
has
discovered
for
himself
that
when
a
strong
nature
finds
its
master
it
gives
a
far
higher
and
nobler
love
and
obedience
than
that
given
by
a
shallow
one
whose
opinions
and
ideas
are
merely
wisps
of
fancy
emma
recognised
that
knightley
was
her
master
his
quiet
audacity
his
failure
to
join
in
the
general
pæan
of
flattery
she
received
his
manliness
in
controlling
his
own
feelings
appealed
to
her
and
we
may
feel
sure
that
her
just
gave
that
finishing
touch
of
softening
to
her
nature
which
it
needed
as
a
loving
wife
with
full
confidence
in
the
judgment
and
principle
of
the
man
she
had
chosen
she
would
grow
softer
and
kindlier
every
day
of
her
life
she
and
frank
churchill
would
very
soon
have
been
disgusted
with
each
other
for
he
was
not
so
weak
as
to
have
surrendered
entirely
to
her
authority
and
constant
friction
would
have
been
the
result
of
their
mating
jane
austen
does
not
make
her
ideal
marriage
a
mere
cementing
of
friendship
she
recognises
that
to
be
perfect
it
must
have
that
element
of
personal
attraction
which
to
fastidious
minds
alone
makes
marriage
possible
knightley
was
emma
s
friend
and
adviser
from
the
first
but
not
until
her
inclination
for
him
was
revealed
in
a
lightning
flash
did
the
idea
of
marrying
him
enter
her
head
the
difference
between
this
personal
inclination
and
the
fantasy
of
youth
is
that
what
is
cause
in
the
one
is
effect
in
the
other
in
the
case
of
real
love
the
personal
appearance
is
loved
because
of
the
personality
behind
it
in
the
spurious
attraction
the
personal
appearance
is
the
first
consequence
and
the
character
behind
it
is
idealised
with
the
constant
result
of
woeful
disillusionment
in
one
place
jane
shows
how
fully
she
realised
the
difference
between
the
true
and
the
false
by
a
little
saying
three
and
period
when
if
a
man
chooses
a
wife
he
generally
chooses
in
the
softest
and
most
tender
of
her
books
she
gives
a
beautiful
picture
of
a
girl
s
real
love
a
love
which
lasted
through
time
and
brought
out
what
was
best
in
the
character
and
in
one
of
the
most
charming
scenes
in
this
novel
anne
elliot
the
heroine
gives
her
views
on
men
s
and
women
s
constancy
your
men
s
feelings
may
be
the
strongest
replied
anne
but
the
same
spirit
of
analogy
will
authorise
me
to
assert
that
ours
are
the
most
tender
man
is
more
robust
than
woman
but
he
is
not
longer
lived
which
exactly
explains
my
view
of
the
nature
of
their
attachments
nay
it
would
be
too
hard
upon
you
if
it
were
otherwise
you
have
difficulties
and
privations
and
dangers
enough
to
struggle
with
you
are
always
labouring
and
toiling
exposed
to
every
risk
and
hardship
your
home
country
friends
all
quitted
neither
time
nor
health
nor
life
to
be
called
your
own
it
would
be
too
hard
indeed
if
with
a
faltering
voice
woman
s
feelings
were
to
be
added
to
all
this
in
spite
of
its
somewhat
glorified
view
of
an
ordinary
man
s
career
is
very
touching
and
still
more
so
what
we
can
never
expect
to
prove
anything
upon
such
a
point
it
is
a
difference
of
opinion
which
does
not
admit
of
proof
we
each
begin
probably
with
a
little
bias
towards
our
own
sex
and
upon
that
bias
build
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
which
has
occurred
within
our
own
circle
i
hope
to
do
justice
to
all
that
is
felt
by
believe
you
capable
of
everything
great
and
good
in
your
married
lives
i
believe
you
equal
to
every
important
exertion
and
to
every
domestic
forbearance
so
long
i
may
be
allowed
the
long
as
you
have
an
object
i
mean
while
the
woman
you
love
lives
and
lives
for
you
all
the
privilege
i
claim
for
my
own
sex
it
is
not
a
very
enviable
one
you
need
not
covet
it
is
that
of
loving
longest
when
existence
or
when
hope
is
natures
which
set
their
all
on
the
chance
of
such
a
high
throw
as
the
demand
for
a
marriage
combining
personal
attraction
and
real
suitability
of
character
know
well
that
it
is
not
likely
that
they
will
win
people
who
ask
only
for
personal
attraction
and
risk
all
the
rest
are
in
different
case
but
it
is
remarkable
how
the
growing
generation
of
men
are
learning
to
look
below
the
surface
and
to
take
some
trouble
to
find
out
the
character
of
the
girl
who
has
attracted
them
before
binding
themselves
men
even
young
men
do
not
rush
into
marriage
with
the
same
lack
of
all
that
a
previous
generation
did
with
the
evaporation
of
the
sentimentality
of
the
victorian
period
there
has
come
also
a
far
higher
ideal
of
marriage
and
a
man
demands
more
of
his
wife
than
evanescent
personal
attractions
though
jane
set
love
at
a
high
altitude
she
was
perfectly
free
from
false
sentiment
or
silly
sentimentality
she
says
in
one
place
of
a
man
who
loves
hopelessly
it
is
no
creed
of
mine
as
you
must
be
well
aware
that
such
sorts
of
disappointments
kill
and
her
delightful
sense
of
humour
shows
up
in
an
inimitable
light
the
foolish
weakness
of
a
girl
suffering
from
a
purely
imaginary
the
occasion
is
after
the
disillusionment
of
poor
sentimental
harriet
as
to
the
real
feelings
of
elton
whom
she
had
been
encouraged
by
emma
to
regard
as
an
unexpressed
lover
harriet
came
one
morning
to
emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
and
after
sitting
down
and
hesitating
thus
miss
woodhouse
if
you
are
at
leisure
i
have
something
that
i
should
like
to
tell
you
a
sort
of
confession
to
then
you
know
it
will
be
emma
was
a
good
deal
surprised
but
begged
her
to
speak
how
could
i
be
so
long
fancying
cried
harriet
warmly
it
seems
like
madness
i
can
see
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
him
now
i
do
not
care
whether
i
meet
him
or
not
except
that
of
the
two
i
had
rather
not
see
him
and
indeed
i
would
go
any
distance
round
to
avoid
him
but
i
do
not
envy
his
wife
in
the
least
i
neither
admire
her
nor
envy
her
as
i
have
done
she
is
very
charming
i
daresay
and
all
that
but
i
think
her
very
and
disagreeable
i
shall
never
forget
her
look
the
other
night
however
i
assure
you
miss
woodhouse
i
wish
her
no
evil
no
let
them
be
ever
so
happy
together
it
will
not
give
me
another
moment
s
pang
and
to
convince
you
that
i
have
been
speaking
the
truth
i
am
now
going
to
i
ought
to
have
destroyed
long
i
ought
never
to
have
kept
i
know
that
very
well
blushing
as
she
spoke
however
now
i
will
destroy
it
all
and
it
is
my
particular
wish
to
do
it
in
your
presence
that
you
may
see
how
rational
i
am
grown
can
not
you
guess
what
this
parcel
holds
said
she
with
a
conscious
look
not
the
least
in
the
world
did
he
ever
give
you
anything
no
i
can
not
call
them
gifts
but
they
are
things
that
i
have
valued
very
she
held
the
parcel
towards
her
and
emma
read
the
words
most
precious
treasures
on
the
top
her
curiosity
was
greatly
excited
harriet
unfolded
the
parcel
and
she
looked
on
with
impatience
within
abundance
of
silver
paper
was
a
pretty
little
box
which
harriet
opened
it
was
well
lined
with
the
softest
cotton
but
excepting
the
cotton
emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
now
said
harriet
you
no
indeed
i
do
dear
me
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it
do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
finger
with
your
new
and
your
recommending
but
as
you
had
none
about
you
and
knew
i
had
you
desired
me
to
supply
him
and
so
i
took
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large
and
he
cut
it
smaller
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me
and
so
then
in
my
nonsense
i
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
so
i
put
it
by
never
to
be
used
and
looked
at
it
now
and
then
as
a
great
my
dearest
harriet
cried
emma
putting
her
hands
before
her
face
and
jumping
up
and
so
you
actually
put
this
piece
of
by
for
his
sake
and
secretly
she
added
to
herself
lord
bless
me
when
should
i
ever
have
thought
of
putting
by
in
cotton
a
piece
of
that
frank
churchill
had
been
pulling
about
i
never
was
equal
to
here
resumed
harriet
turning
to
her
box
again
here
is
something
still
more
valuable
mean
that
more
valuable
this
is
what
did
really
once
belong
to
him
which
the
never
emma
was
quite
eager
to
see
this
superior
treasure
it
was
the
end
of
an
old
pencil
the
part
without
any
lead
this
was
really
his
said
harriet
do
not
you
remember
one
morning
i
forget
exactly
the
day
he
wanted
to
make
a
memorandum
in
his
it
was
about
spruce
beer
and
he
wanted
to
put
it
down
but
when
he
took
out
his
pencil
there
was
so
little
lead
that
he
soon
cut
it
all
away
and
it
would
not
do
so
you
lent
him
another
and
this
was
left
upon
the
table
as
good
for
nothing
but
i
kept
my
eye
upon
it
and
as
soon
as
i
dared
caught
it
up
and
never
parted
with
it
again
from
that
my
poor
dear
harriet
and
have
you
actually
found
happiness
in
treasuring
up
these
things
yes
simpleton
as
i
was
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
now
and
wish
i
could
forget
as
easily
as
i
can
burn
them
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
you
know
to
keep
any
remembrances
after
he
was
married
i
knew
it
had
not
resolution
enough
to
part
with
this
is
pure
comedy
in
jane
austen
s
day
there
certainly
was
an
openness
in
the
arrangements
about
marriage
that
jars
on
our
more
reticent
minds
of
course
it
is
undeniable
that
at
that
time
a
girl
s
only
vocation
unless
she
happened
to
be
a
genius
was
marriage
but
the
way
in
which
suitability
as
to
means
and
position
were
frequently
considered
as
of
all
importance
and
love
merely
as
a
secondary
consideration
is
slightly
perturbing
jane
austen
s
high
ideal
of
marriage
must
have
been
rarer
then
than
at
the
present
time
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
shameless
discussion
of
the
de
in
the
novels
is
the
interview
between
elinor
dashwood
and
her
brother
when
colonel
brandon
has
shown
some
slight
attention
to
her
her
brother
begins
by
who
is
colonel
brandon
is
he
a
man
of
fortune
yes
he
has
very
good
property
in
i
am
glad
of
it
he
seems
a
most
gentlemanlike
man
and
i
think
elinor
i
may
congratulate
you
on
the
prospect
of
a
very
respectable
establishment
in
me
brother
what
do
you
mean
he
likes
you
i
observed
him
narrowly
and
am
convinced
of
it
what
is
the
amount
of
his
fortune
i
believe
about
two
thousand
a
two
thousand
a
year
then
working
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiastic
generosity
he
added
elinor
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
were
twice
as
much
for
your
indeed
i
believe
you
replied
elinor
but
i
am
very
sure
that
colonel
brandon
has
not
the
smallest
wish
of
marrying
you
are
mistaken
elinor
you
are
very
much
mistaken
a
very
little
trouble
on
your
side
secures
him
perhaps
just
at
present
he
may
be
undecided
the
smallness
of
your
fortune
may
make
him
hang
back
his
friends
may
all
advise
him
against
it
but
some
of
those
little
attentions
and
encouragements
which
ladies
can
so
easily
give
will
fix
him
in
spite
of
himself
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
try
for
him
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
prior
attachment
on
your
short
you
know
as
to
an
attachment
of
that
kind
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
the
objections
are
brandon
must
be
the
man
and
no
civility
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
make
him
pleased
with
you
and
your
family
it
is
a
match
that
must
give
universal
the
prior
attachment
was
that
to
his
own
edward
ferrars
for
whom
his
wife
hoped
to
get
a
better
match
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
man
in
question
colonel
brandon
was
not
in
love
with
elinor
but
with
her
impulsive
sister
marianne
who
was
wasting
away
under
the
slights
of
willoughby
of
her
her
brother
kindly
at
her
time
of
life
anything
of
an
illness
destroys
the
bloom
for
ever
hers
has
been
a
very
short
one
she
was
as
handsome
a
girl
last
september
as
ever
i
saw
and
as
likely
to
attract
the
men
there
was
something
in
her
style
of
beauty
to
please
them
particularly
i
remember
fanny
used
to
say
she
would
marry
sooner
and
better
than
you
did
she
will
be
mistaken
however
i
question
whether
marianne
now
will
marry
a
man
worth
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
at
the
utmost
and
i
am
very
much
deceived
if
you
do
not
do
elinor
tried
very
seriously
to
convince
him
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
her
marrying
colonel
brandon
but
it
was
an
expectation
of
too
much
pleasure
to
himself
to
be
relinquished
he
had
just
compunction
enough
for
having
done
nothing
for
his
sisters
himself
to
be
exceedingly
anxious
that
everyone
else
should
do
a
great
and
john
dashwood
s
idea
of
the
barter
of
women
for
so
much
according
to
their
attractions
though
it
differed
not
in
essentials
from
that
of
a
circassian
was
quite
an
ordinary
one
the
eagerness
with
which
any
heiress
was
literally
pursued
the
desperate
devices
to
get
portionless
daughters
married
doubtless
have
their
counterparts
now
but
they
are
not
so
prominent
portionless
daughters
of
wit
and
talent
can
make
lives
for
themselves
independent
of
matrimony
and
heiress
hunters
have
at
least
the
decency
to
pretend
they
are
in
love
in
view
of
the
ideas
of
her
times
jane
s
ideal
of
marriage
stands
out
conspicuously
she
wanted
all
her
heroines
to
have
every
probability
of
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
and
though
perhaps
she
did
not
consciously
set
to
work
to
consider
what
would
make
them
so
in
so
many
words
it
is
remarkable
that
certain
points
which
from
her
own
observations
of
the
human
race
were
the
best
foundations
for
married
happiness
are
to
be
found
in
every
one
of
the
marriages
of
her
principal
characters
the
first
essential
which
we
have
already
touched
upon
was
suitability
of
character
poor
marianne
dashwood
and
the
ardent
willoughby
would
have
tried
each
other
desperately
with
the
vehemence
of
their
enthusiasm
in
six
months
they
would
have
loathed
each
other
as
ardently
as
they
had
loved
therefore
marianne
is
not
allowed
to
marry
willoughby
but
mates
with
colonel
brandon
the
sort
of
man
who
would
exercise
an
unconscious
influence
over
her
teaching
her
and
who
would
be
kindly
indulgent
to
her
whims
and
wishes
not
clashing
with
them
on
his
own
account
the
second
essential
which
is
fulfilled
in
every
case
of
the
principal
characters
in
the
novels
is
that
the
marriages
are
real
unions
not
those
accidental
associations
which
are
based
on
imagination
her
men
and
women
get
to
know
each
other
thoroughly
by
constant
intercourse
until
the
faults
and
virtues
the
defects
and
abilities
are
clear
and
plain
jane
knew
that
real
love
may
begin
by
attraction
but
must
be
built
upon
knowledge
in
not
a
single
case
is
a
pretty
face
or
a
handsome
person
the
reason
for
a
man
s
or
woman
s
falling
in
love
darcy
considers
elizabeth
bennet
only
tolerable
when
he
first
sees
her
it
is
when
he
begins
to
care
for
her
that
he
notes
her
fine
though
catherine
morland
was
a
pretty
girl
it
was
not
that
which
won
henry
tilney
but
her
naïve
adoration
of
himself
and
her
sweet
sincerity
edmund
bertram
runs
after
miss
crawford
for
a
time
but
it
is
the
excellence
of
fanny
s
mind
which
gives
him
his
life
s
happiness
and
so
on
through
all
the
third
essential
in
jane
s
mind
was
evidently
that
the
love
of
the
two
should
be
mutual
in
every
case
her
heroine
is
genuinely
in
love
before
she
gives
her
consent
to
marriage
fanny
bertram
of
course
knew
her
own
love
for
edmund
long
before
his
eyes
were
opened
to
the
need
he
had
for
her
anne
elliot
had
bitterly
regretted
for
many
weary
years
the
fatal
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
her
friends
which
had
separated
her
from
the
man
she
loved
and
when
he
returns
only
to
pay
attentions
to
another
and
she
imagines
she
has
lost
him
for
ever
she
still
never
swerves
in
her
loyalty
to
him
poor
elinor
has
the
mortification
of
hearing
from
the
lips
of
a
rival
that
edward
ferrars
is
engaged
to
her
but
still
her
choice
never
falters
for
women
of
this
kind
women
of
fine
character
marriage
without
love
is
impossible
in
the
abstract
it
is
not
a
necessity
as
it
often
seems
to
be
to
a
man
if
they
can
not
have
the
one
man
they
love
they
will
infinitely
prefer
to
remain
single
we
must
admit
that
as
anne
elliot
says
the
power
of
loving
longest
remains
with
women
only
we
should
amend
to
the
extent
of
saying
with
the
noblest
women
many
men
hold
that
woman
s
love
is
not
essential
to
a
happy
marriage
so
long
as
they
are
in
love
with
the
woman
they
make
their
wife
they
think
that
her
love
is
not
necessary
this
arises
purely
from
want
of
imagination
they
themselves
marrying
a
woman
they
passionately
admire
start
with
all
the
glamour
and
glory
which
suffices
to
veil
the
difficult
beginnings
of
a
à
but
the
woman
who
enters
without
this
help
has
to
expend
an
immense
amount
of
patience
and
over
wearisome
domestic
details
which
would
be
transformed
into
pure
joy
if
she
also
saw
through
a
glorified
atmosphere
a
match
where
the
woman
does
not
love
is
very
hard
on
her
it
is
of
course
perfectly
true
that
the
ardent
love
of
a
man
has
often
won
a
woman
s
love
in
return
many
a
happy
marriage
has
sprung
from
this
beginning
but
any
man
who
is
not
more
selfish
than
the
rest
of
his
sex
should
try
to
assure
himself
that
the
love
is
there
before
marriage
of
course
to
a
man
it
is
incredible
that
girls
will
consent
to
marry
when
they
do
not
love
why
should
they
one
knows
it
is
not
always
the
prospect
of
a
home
and
maintenance
one
would
scorn
to
assess
woman
s
nature
at
so
low
a
rate
there
is
no
real
explanation
though
possibly
dense
ignorance
and
girlish
impulse
toward
the
excitement
and
the
trivial
accessories
of
a
bride
s
position
may
be
the
most
usual
contributory
causes
if
this
is
so
as
woman
increases
in
intelligence
and
reasonable
knowledge
that
is
to
say
as
she
becomes
more
fit
to
be
a
real
mate
to
man
so
will
man
find
it
increasingly
difficult
to
persuade
her
into
a
marriage
oftentimes
so
disastrous
to
both
and
at
the
best
such
a
makeshift
for
what
might
be

visits
and
travelling
jane
austen
s
life
was
very
largely
passed
among
her
own
relations
her
visits
away
from
home
were
nearly
always
to
the
houses
of
her
brothers
in
the
august
of
she
went
to
stay
with
her
brother
edward
at
rowling
a
little
place
in
kent
near
goodnestone
edward
had
been
married
for
some
time
to
elizabeth
bridges
daughter
of
sir
brook
bridges
of
goodnestone
he
had
as
has
been
already
stated
been
adopted
by
his
relative
knight
of
godmersham
in
kent
and
chawton
in
hampshire
and
had
taken
his
name
this
knight
had
died
two
years
previously
and
left
edward
his
heir
subject
to
the
widow
s
but
knight
herself
loved
edward
like
a
son
and
retired
from
godmersham
in
his
favour
at
this
date
however
the
family
had
not
yet
moved
there
but
continued
to
live
at
rowling
of
the
pleasant
country
life
at
rowling
we
get
several
graphic
touches
we
were
at
a
ball
on
saturday
i
assure
you
we
dined
at
goodnestone
and
in
the
evening
danced
two
country
dances
and
the
boulangeries
i
opened
the
ball
with
edward
bridges
the
other
couples
were
lewis
cage
and
harriet
frank
and
louisa
fanny
and
george
elizabeth
played
one
country
dance
lady
bridges
the
other
which
she
made
henry
dance
with
her
and
miss
finch
played
the
the
boulangeries
seems
to
have
been
an
innovation
adopted
from
france
and
occasionally
formed
the
last
figure
of
a
quadrille
which
had
many
variations
either
with
a
chassecroise
or
with
la
boulangère
la
corbeille
le
moulinet
or
la
ste
of
the
couples
mentioned
above
lewis
cage
had
married
fanny
bridges
harriet
and
louisa
were
two
young
unmarried
sisters
frank
and
henry
jane
s
brothers
henry
austen
seems
to
have
been
of
a
very
unsettled
disposition
in
jane
s
first
letter
she
says
henry
is
still
hankering
after
the
regulars
and
as
his
project
of
purchasing
the
adjutancy
of
the
oxfordshire
is
now
over
he
has
got
a
scheme
in
his
head
about
getting
a
lieutenancy
and
adjutancy
in
the
a
new
raised
regiment
which
he
fancies
will
be
ordered
to
the
cape
of
good
later
on
henry
became
for
oxfordshire
afterwards
he
was
partner
in
a
bank
and
when
the
bank
broke
in
he
took
orders
and
on
the
death
of
his
brother
james
he
held
the
living
of
steventon
for
a
short
time
until
one
of
his
brother
edward
s
younger
boys
was
ready
for
it
after
the
impromptu
evening
s
entertainment
at
goodnestone
the
party
walked
home
under
the
shade
of
two
umbrellas
another
day
they
dined
at
nackington
returning
by
moonlight
in
two
carriages
visits
were
of
long
duration
in
days
when
getting
about
was
so
costly
and
difficult
a
process
jane
stayed
on
with
her
brother
until
october
and
in
september
she
records
edward
and
fly
went
out
yesterday
very
early
in
a
couple
of
shooting
jackets
and
came
home
like
a
couple
of
bad
shots
for
they
killed
nothing
at
all
they
are
out
again
and
are
not
yet
returned
delightful
sport
they
are
just
come
home
edward
with
his
two
brace
frank
with
his
two
and
a
half
what
amiable
young
men
she
also
records
we
are
very
busy
making
edward
s
shirts
and
i
am
proud
to
say
i
am
the
neatest
worker
of
the
party
and
again
little
edward
her
brother
s
eldest
boy
was
breeched
yesterday
for
good
and
all
and
was
whipped
into
the
this
is
very
small
beer
but
it
suffices
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
pleasant
family
life
where
half
the
neighbours
were
related
to
each
other
and
on
cordial
terms
where
entertainments
were
simple
and
spontaneous
though
it
was
an
age
that
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
one
of
the
most
formal
in
social
history
jane
alludes
to
her
difficulties
of
tipping
i
am
in
great
distress
i
can
not
determine
whether
i
shall
give
richis
half
a
guinea
or
only
five
shillings
when
i
go
away
counsel
me
most
amiable
miss
austen
and
tell
me
which
will
be
the
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
our
own
age
as
lying
under
the
thraldom
of
tips
as
none
ever
did
before
but
it
is
nothing
to
what
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
in
this
respect
when
people
went
to
dinner
they
were
expected
to
tip
the
servants
who
sometimes
stood
in
long
rows
in
the
hall
waiting
the
customary
douceur
as
for
hotels
they
were
worse
than
for
it
must
be
remembered
money
was
of
greater
relative
value
in
a
letter
from
a
constant
reader
to
in
october
the
vexed
subject
of
tips
is
if
a
man
who
has
a
horse
puts
up
at
an
inn
besides
the
usual
bill
he
must
at
least
give
to
the
waiter
to
the
chambermaid
to
the
ostler
and
to
the
making
together
at
breakfast
you
must
give
at
least
between
the
waiter
and
hostler
if
the
traveller
only
puts
up
to
have
a
refreshment
besides
paying
for
his
horses
standing
he
must
give
to
the
hostler
at
dinner
to
the
waiter
and
to
the
hostler
at
tea
between
them
so
that
he
gives
away
in
the
day
which
added
to
the
for
the
night
makes
per
day
on
an
average
to
jane
did
not
expect
to
be
able
to
return
to
steventon
until
about
the
middle
of
october
but
it
was
necessary
to
lay
plans
long
before
so
as
to
arrange
if
possible
for
the
escort
of
one
of
her
brothers
as
it
was
not
thought
at
all
the
proper
thing
for
a
young
lady
to
go
by
herself
on
a
journey
and
considering
the
changes
at
and
many
stoppages
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
just
at
this
time
frank
austen
received
a
naval
appointment
and
had
to
be
up
in
town
the
next
day
september
so
jane
seized
the
opportunity
to
go
with
him
as
to
the
mode
of
our
travelling
to
town
i
want
to
go
in
a
stage
coach
but
frank
will
not
let
this
means
of
course
that
they
would
have
to
travel
post
a
much
more
expensive
performance
the
whole
subject
of
travelling
is
one
of
the
things
that
bring
more
vividly
before
us
than
any
other
the
difference
of
the
then
and
the
now
in
an
act
was
passed
compelling
districts
all
over
the
country
to
make
turnpike
roads
and
charge
toll
accordingly
before
this
date
the
state
of
the
roads
had
been
too
terrible
for
description
and
even
after
it
progressed
but
slowly
for
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
macadam
s
improvements
were
adopted
up
to
roads
had
been
made
certainly
after
a
fashion
and
many
acts
had
been
passed
with
the
object
of
improving
them
but
these
had
not
had
much
effect
even
the
great
act
of
seemed
to
be
of
little
practical
efficacy
for
between
and
inclusive
upwards
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
acts
of
parliament
were
passed
in
order
to
effect
the
formation
of
new
and
the
repair
and
alteration
of
old
highways
throughout
the
country
so
parliament
certainly
can
not
be
accused
of
regarding
the
matter
with
indifference
many
are
the
complaints
of
travellers
arthur
young
in
his
mentions
the
roads
frequently
much
more
to
be
condemned
is
the
execrable
muddy
road
from
bury
to
sudbury
in
suffolk
in
which
i
was
forced
to
move
as
slow
as
in
any
unmended
lane
in
wales
for
ponds
of
liquid
dirt
and
a
scattering
of
loose
flints
just
sufficient
to
lame
every
horse
that
moves
near
them
with
the
addition
of
cutting
vile
grips
across
the
road
under
pretence
of
letting
water
off
but
without
the
effect
altogether
render
at
least
twelve
of
these
sixteen
miles
as
infamous
a
turnpike
as
ever
was
travelled
their
method
of
mending
the
last
mentioned
road
i
found
excessively
absurd
for
in
parts
of
it
the
sides
are
higher
than
the
middle
and
the
gravel
they
bring
in
is
nothing
more
but
a
yellow
loam
with
a
few
stones
in
it
through
which
the
wheels
of
a
light
chaise
cut
as
easily
as
in
sand
with
the
addition
of
such
floods
of
watery
mud
as
renders
the
road
on
the
whole
inferior
to
nothing
but
an
unmended
welsh
lane
from
chepstow
to
the
half
way
house
between
newport
and
cardiff
they
continue
mere
rocky
lanes
full
of
hugeous
stones
as
big
as
one
s
horse
and
abominable
though
the
stones
as
big
as
one
s
horse
must
be
allowed
for
as
the
pardonable
exaggeration
of
a
traveller
s
tale
it
is
true
that
the
method
of
road
mending
previous
to
macadam
was
nothing
more
than
setting
down
enormous
stones
to
be
crushed
in
by
passing
wheels
but
as
they
were
not
set
close
the
wheels
went
bumping
into
the
mud
between
and
the
force
of
the
jolt
instead
of
setting
the
stones
pushed
them
out
of
position
ever
worse
and
worse
where
they
are
mending
as
they
call
it
you
travel
over
a
bed
of
loose
stones
none
of
less
size
than
an
octavo
volume
and
where
not
mended
tis
like
a
as
for
the
means
of
conveyance
over
these
vile
highways
before
the
making
of
waggons
had
been
the
usual
method
and
flying
coaches
as
they
were
at
first
called
were
considered
a
great
improvement
however
coach
fares
were
high
and
even
after
the
introduction
of
coaches
many
people
who
were
unable
to
afford
them
still
travelled
by
the
waggon
this
mode
of
proceeding
must
have
been
inexpressibly
wearisome
here
is
an
account
of
a
journey
made
by
such
means
from
london
to
we
were
passengers
within
side
and
nine
without
it
was
my
lot
to
sit
in
the
middle
with
a
very
lusty
woman
on
one
side
and
a
very
thin
man
on
the
other
open
the
window
said
the
former
and
she
had
a
child
on
her
lap
whose
hands
were
all
besmeared
with
gingerbread
it
can
t
be
opened
said
a
little
prim
coxcomb
or
i
shall
get
but
i
say
it
shall
sir
said
a
butcher
who
sat
opposite
to
him
and
the
butcher
opened
it
but
as
he
stood
or
rather
bent
forward
to
do
this
the
caravan
came
into
a
rut
and
the
butcher
s
head
by
the
suddenness
of
the
jolt
came
into
contact
with
that
of
the
woman
who
sat
next
to
me
and
made
her
nose
bleed
he
begged
her
pardon
and
she
gave
him
a
slap
on
the
face
that
sounded
through
the
whole
caravan
two
sailors
that
were
seated
near
the
helm
of
this
machine
ordered
the
driver
to
cast
anchor
at
the
next
public
house
he
did
so
and
the
woman
next
to
me
called
for
a
pint
of
ale
which
she
offered
to
me
after
she
had
emptied
about
a
pint
of
it
observing
that
as
how
she
loved
ale
i
could
not
drink
at
which
she
took
offence
a
violent
dispute
now
arose
between
two
men
the
one
a
recruiting
sergeant
the
other
a
gentleman
s
coachman
about
the
rights
of
man
another
dispute
afterwards
was
about
politics
which
was
carried
on
with
such
warmth
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
company
to
the
head
of
the
caravan
where
the
combatants
sat
wedged
together
like
two
pounds
of
epping
butter
whilst
a
child
incessantly
roared
at
the
opposite
side
and
the
mother
abused
the
two
politicians
for
frightening
her
babe
the
heat
was
now
so
great
that
all
the
windows
were
opened
and
with
the
fresh
air
entered
clouds
of
dust
for
the
body
of
the
machine
is
but
a
few
inches
from
the
surface
of
the
if
one
can
imagine
this
kind
of
thing
continuing
for
hour
after
hour
while
one
s
bones
ached
with
the
cramp
and
one
was
stupefied
with
the
noise
and
smell
one
gains
some
idea
of
the
delights
of
waggon
travelling
we
find
an
account
of
the
roads
actually
in
hampshire
jane
austen
s
own
county
in
the
correspondence
of
lady
newdigate
cheverels
of
cheverel
in
giving
an
account
of
going
from
arbury
warwick
to
stanstead
near
portsmouth
in
she
says
the
sisters
were
decidedly
for
going
through
reading
and
farnham
but
cotton
from
consultation
of
maps
and
conversation
with
postillions
believed
it
would
be
full
as
good
and
pleasant
and
a
much
shorter
road
to
go
by
basingstoke
and
alton
in
the
first
of
these
places
we
found
it
miles
instead
of
and
were
informed
that
instead
of
ten
miles
good
turnpike
to
alton
there
was
not
above
three
miles
made
and
the
rest
so
cut
as
to
be
impassable
for
such
a
carriage
as
mine
in
short
that
we
had
twelve
miles
across
country
road
the
consequence
was
that
we
had
eight
miles
bad
road
out
of
and
was
an
hour
in
the
dark
but
the
poneys
performed
lady
newdigate
also
gives
the
cost
of
this
journey
which
is
interesting
we
paid
per
mile
great
part
of
the
way
for
the
chaisehorses
and
all
the
way
for
the
saddle
horse
the
whole
baits
and
sleepings
included
comes
to
above
to
this
on
the
way
to
brighton
two
years
later
she
says
i
never
saw
this
road
so
rotted
so
heavy
or
so
deep
it
was
with
difficulty
my
poor
poneys
could
drag
we
have
therefore
a
tolerable
notion
of
the
fatigues
attendant
on
a
journey
in
those
days
another
drawback
was
that
if
one
wished
to
travel
by
coach
instead
of
going
post
one
could
not
always
be
sure
of
a
place
unless
booked
beforehand
this
kind
of
thing
frequently
i
was
called
up
be
ready
for
the
coach
but
judge
my
disappointment
and
chagrin
when
on
my
approach
i
found
it
i
petitioned
reasoned
urged
and
entreated
but
all
to
no
effect
i
could
not
make
any
impression
on
the
obdurate
souls
who
proud
and
sulky
kept
easy
and
firm
possession
of
their
seats
and
hardly
deigned
to
answer
when
i
requested
permission
to
squeeze
in
i
was
hoisted
on
the
coach
box
as
the
only
alternative
but
on
the
first
movement
of
the
vehicle
had
it
not
been
for
the
arm
of
the
coachman
i
should
have
been
instantly
under
the
wheels
in
the
street
i
was
chucked
into
a
basket
as
a
place
of
more
safety
though
not
of
ease
or
comfort
where
i
suffered
most
severely
from
the
jolting
particularly
over
the
stones
it
was
most
truly
dreadful
and
made
one
suffer
almost
equal
to
sea
tate
wilkinson
this
basket
was
actually
a
basket
slung
on
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
luggage
though
it
was
also
used
for
passengers
and
sometimes
filled
with
people
in
spite
of
its
discomfort
because
seats
here
were
charged
at
a
low
price

out

were

the
roofs
of

rose

behind
the

was
the
immense

stretching
far
and
wide
beyond
the

to
which
it
was
attached
by
long
iron
bars
or
supports
passing
beneath
it
the

of

carriages
were
large
massive
and
usually
of
a
red
colour
and
the
three
horses
that
were
affixed
to
the
whole
machine
were
all
so
far
parted
from
it
by
the
great
length
of
their
traces
that
it
was
with
no

difficulty
that
the
poor

dragged
their
unwieldly
burden
along
the
illustration
from
a
summer
s
evening
the
accidents
attendant
on
coach
journeys
were
many
and
various
and
the
badness
of
the
roads
was
the
principal
cause
in
england
s
the
autobiography
of
captain
charles
boothby
we
have
this
account
of
what
happened
to
him
in
when
he
first
left
down
to
portsmouth
then
i
went
on
the
outside
of
the
mail
in
the
highest
health
and
the
ardent
spirits
of
youth
spirits
that
made
i
suppose
even
my
body
buoyant
and
elastic
for
the
mail
overturned
in
the
night
and
threw
me
on
the
road
without
giving
me
so
much
as
a
scratch
or
a
bruise
it
was
about
twenty
miles
from
london
when
we
met
a
team
of
horses
standing
in
a
slant
direction
on
the
road
the
night
very
foggy
with
misting
rain
and
the
lamps
not
penetrating
further
into
the
mist
than
the
rumps
of
the
wheelers
the
coachman
to
avoid
the
waggon
turned
suddenly
out
of
the
way
and
ran
up
the
bank
finding
the
coach
staggering
i
got
up
with
my
face
to
the
horses
hardly
daring
to
suppose
it
possible
that
the
mail
could
overturn
when
the
unwieldly
monster
was
on
one
wheel
and
then
down
it
came
with
a
terminal
bang
during
my
descent
i
had
just
time
to
hope
that
i
might
escape
with
the
fracture
of
one
or
two
legs
and
then
found
myself
on
my
two
shoulders
very
pleased
with
the
novelty
and
ease
of
the
journey
i
got
up
and
spied
the
monster
with
his
two
free
wheels
whirling
with
great
velocity
but
quite
compact
and
still
in
the
body
and
as
soon
as
i
had
shaken
my
feathers
and
opened
my
senses
i
began
to
think
of
the
one
female
and
three
males
in
the
inside
whom
i
supposed
to
be
either
dead
or
asleep
i
ran
to
open
the
door
when
the
guard
having
thought
of
the
same
thing
did
it
for
me
and
we
then
took
the
folks
out
one
by
one
like
pickled
ghirkins
or
anything
else
preserved
in
a
jar
by
putting
our
hands
to
the
bottom
we
found
that
the
inmates
were
only
stupefied
though
all
had
bruises
of
some
kind
and
one
little
gentleman
complained
that
he
was
nipped
in
the
loins
by
the
mighty
pressure
of
his
neighbour
who
had
sat
upon
him
some
time
after
the
door
was
opened
to
recollect
himself
or
to
give
thanks
for
his
coaches
did
not
as
a
rule
run
on
sundays
so
passengers
whose
journeys
were
to
extend
over
several
days
had
to
take
care
to
start
early
in
the
week
if
they
did
not
wish
to
pay
expenses
at
an
inn
during
the
sabbath
this
rule
was
however
not
stringently
observed
as
grosley
found
when
he
landed
in
england
on
his
tour
of
the
great
multitude
of
passengers
with
which
dover
was
then
crowded
formed
a
reason
for
dispensing
with
a
law
of
the
police
by
which
public
carriages
are
in
england
forbid
to
travel
on
sundays
i
therefore
set
out
on
a
sunday
with
seven
more
passengers
in
two
carriages
called
flying
machines
these
vehicles
which
are
drawn
by
six
horses
go
leagues
in
a
day
from
dover
to
london
for
a
single
guinea
servants
are
entitled
to
a
place
for
half
that
money
either
behind
the
coach
or
upon
the
coach
box
which
has
three
places
a
vast
repository
under
this
seat
which
is
very
lofty
holds
the
passengers
luggage
which
is
paid
for
separately
the
coachmen
whom
we
changed
every
time
with
our
horses
were
lusty
well
made
men
dressed
in
good
among
the
advantages
of
travelling
on
a
sunday

coaches
were
not
expected
he
enumerates
that
we
should
meet
none
of
those
gentry
who
are
called
collectors
of
the
highway
and
of
whom
there
is
a
great
number
upon
the
road
in
fact
we
saw
none
of
that
sort
but
such
as
were
hanging
upon
gibbets
at
the
road
side
there
they
dangle
dressed
from
head
to
foot
and
with
wigs
upon
their
the
austen
women
do
not
seem
at
any
time
to
have
travelled
by
coach
but
always
post
a
much
more
comfortable
method
ensuring
privacy
though
it
also
had
its
disadvantages
as
when
one
arrived
at
an
inn
requiring
change
of
horses
only
to
find
the
marquess
of
carabbas
had
passed
on
before
with
a
whole
retinue
of
attendants
taking
every
horse
in
the
stable
and
the
second
comers
were
therefore
compelled
to
wait
until
the
return
of
the
jaded
steeds
and
to
use
them
again
when
the
poor
beasts
had
only
had
half
the
rest
they
deserved
the
keeping
of
horses
was
a
necessary
branch
of
the
business
of
every
on
the
a
branch
which
is
now
seldom
called
for
so
that
it
is
only
at
very
large
establishments
or
those
in
the
most
districts
where
trains
come

we
reached

very
well
my

bore

she
was
a
very
little
fatigued
on
her
arrival
at
this
place
has
been
quite
refreshed
by
a
comfortable
dinner
and
now
seems
quite
stout
it
wanted
five
minutes
of
twelve
when
we
left
sittingbourne
from
whence
we
had
a
famous
pair
of
horses
which
took
us
to
rochester
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
the
postboy
seemed
determined
to
show
my
mother
that
kentish
drivers
were
not

tedious
our
next
stage
was
not
quite
so
expeditiously
performed
the
road
was
heavy
and
our
horses
very
indifferent
however
we
were
in
such
good
time
and
my
mother
bore
her
journey
so
well
that
expedition
was
of
little
importance
to
us
and
as
it
was
we
were
very
little
more
than
two
hours
and
a
half
coming
hither
and
it
was
scarcely
past
four
when
we
stopped
at
the
inn
my
mother
took
some
of
her
bitters
at
ospringe
and
some
more
at
rochester
and
she
ate
some
bread
several
times
we
sat
down
to
dinner
a
little
after
five
and
had
some
beefsteak
and
a
boiled
fowl
but
no
oyster
though
jane
refused
to
avail
herself
of
the
very
present
excitement
of
highwaymen
in
any
of
her
novels
she
might
legitimately
have
done
so
for
these
perils
were
by
no

of
the

part

are
full
of

about
three
miles
but
though
the
nights
were

we
had

pratt

i
thought
ourselves
amazingly
lucky
we
were
in

coach
ours

and
the

behind

robbed
it
would
have
been
silly

have
lost

came

night
in

half
an
hour
after
eight

in
the
great
thoroughfare
of
london
and
within
call
of
the
guard
at
the
palace
the
chaise
had
stopped
the
harness
was
cut
and
the
portmanteau
was
taken
out
of
the
chaise
the
travellers
who
had
to
give
up
their
valuables
were
numberless
and
many
ladies
took
to
carrying
secondary
purses
full
of
false
money
which
with
hypocritical
tears
they
handed
out
on
compulsion
there
was
really
not
much
risk
in
the
business
of
a
highwayman
if
a
man
had
a
good
horse
and
good
nerve
the
poor
citizens
he
robbed
were
not
fighting
men
and
though
the
penalty
of
hanging
was
the
award
if
my
and
gallant
gentleman
were
caught
yet
his
chances
of
escape
were
many
the
wonder
is
not
that
highwaymen
were
so
numerous
but
that
with
the
cumbersome
methods
of
capturing
and
dealing
with
them
any
of
them
were
ever
caught

chapter
ix
contemporary
writers
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
an
age
when
merit
in
literature
was
an
open
sesame
to
the
very
best
society
that
the
capital
could
supply
an
author
who
had
brought
out
a
work
a
little
above

rapidly
passed

one
to
another
but
by
the
persons
of
the
highest
social
rank
also
london
was
so
much
smaller
then
that
there
was
not
room
for
all
the
grades
and
sets
that
now
run
parallel
without
ever
overlapping
when
anyone
was
made
welcome
they
were
free
of
all
the
best
society
at
once
and
the
ease
with
which
some
people
slipped
into
the
position
of
social
lions
on
the
strength
of
very
small
performance
is
little
short
of
wonderful
when
hannah
more
first
visited
london
in
she
was
plunged
at
once
into
the
society
of
men
of
letters
of
wit
of
learning
and
of
rank
her
plays
which
to
our
taste
are
intolerably
stiff
and
dull
were
accepted
by
garrick
she
became
his
personal
friend
and
he
introduced
her
to
everyone
whose
acquaintance
was
worth
having
the
garricks
house
became
her
second
home
and
she
met
bishops
by
the
half
dozen
visited
the
lord
chamberlain
at
apsley
house
and
was
on
familiar
terms
with
sheridan
johnson
walpole
reynolds
and
many
another
whose
name
is
still
a
household
word
in
england
in
those
days
the
same
people
met
again
and
again
at
each
other
s
houses
more
after
the
fashion
of
a
country
town
than
of
that
of
london
at
present
indeed
they
seem
to
have
spent
the
whole
day
and
most
of
the
night
running
after
each
other
there
is
one
custom
which
we
must
all
be
thankful
exists
no
longer
the
intolerable
fashion
of
morning
calls
calls
are
bad
enough
now
as
custom
decrees
but
we
are
at
least
free
from
the
terror
of
people
dropping
in
upon
us
before
the
day
s
work
is
begun
when
staying
in
northumberland
miss
mitford
remarks
morning
calls
are
here
made
so
early
that
one
morning
three
different
people
called
before
we
had
done
hannah
more
looked
on
a
morning
visit
as
an
immorality
yet
she
breakfasted
with
a
bishop
afterwards
going
to
an
evening
party
with
another
on
the
same
day
she
being
of
a
sensible
mind
soon
grew
tired
of
the
ceaseless
talk
though
much
of
it
may
have
been
good
stuff
and
worthy
of
preservation
and
she
rejoiced
when
she
could
get
a
day
to
herself
and
deny
herself
to
everyone
after
garrick
s
death
when
she
came
to
stay
with
his
brave
but
widow
she
lived
very
quietly
my
way
of
life
is
very
different
from
what
it
used
to
be
after
breakfast
i
go
to
my
own
apartment
for
several
hours
where
i
read
write
and
work
very
seldom
letting
anybody
in
at
four
we
dine
we
have
the
same
elegant
table
as
usual
but
i
generally
confine
myself
to
one
single
dish
of
meat
i
have
taken
to
drink
half
a
glass
of
wine
at
six
we
have
coffee
at
eight
tea
when
we
have
sometimes
a
dowager
or
two
of
quality
at
ten
we
have
sallad
and
this
was
in
and
two
years
previously
her
play
had
been
brought
out
with
extraordinary
success
she
says
of
it
herself
far
beyond
my
expectation
and
it
produced
more
excitement
than
any
tragedy
had
done
for
many
years
the
author
s
rights
sale
of
copy
amounted
to
near
six
hundred
pounds
and
as
my
friend
garrick
has
been
so
good
as
to
lay
it
out
for
me
on
the
best
security
and
at
five
per
it
makes
a
decent
little
addition
to
my
small
income
cadell
gave
a
very
handsome
price
with
conditional
promises
he
confesses
that
it
had
had
a
very
great
sale
and
that
he
shall
get
a
good
deal
of
money
by
it
the
first
impression
is
near
four
thousand
and
the
second
is
almost
it
is
customary
to
think
of
hannah
more
as
so
quiet
and
quakerish
that
the
idea
of
her
writing
plays
and
living
a
gay
society
life
is
new
to
many
people
but
the
seriousness
and
retirement
came
later
considering
how
easily
the
heights
of
celebrity
were
stormed
at
that
time
and
especially
by
a
woman
it
is
most
remarkable
that
jane
received
no
encouragement
and
had
no
literary
society
and
not
one
literary
correspondent
in
the
whole
of
her
lifetime
of
course
her
first
novel
was
not
published
until
and
then
anonymously
with
the
simple
inscription
by
a
lady
on
the
yet
it
sold
well
and
became
very
popular
and
though
no
effort
was
made
to
proclaim
her
the
authoress
certainly
there
was
no
rigid
attempt
to
hide
her
personality
before
the
publication
of
her
identity
was
known
for
she
was
requested
to
dedicate
this
book
to
the
prince
regent
as
will
be
related
in
due
course
and
this
was
the
only
recognition
of
any
public
sort
she
received
many
of
her
contemporaries
were
brought
up
in
a
sort
of
hotbed
of
intellect
and
associated
with
men
of
talent
and
distinction
from
their
a
wonderful
quickening
and
impetus
must
this
have
brought
with
it
jane
had
none
of
these
advantages
her
genius
was
her
own
entirely
and
her
material
of
the
slightest
she
had
no
contemporaries
of
original
talent
with
which
to
exchange
ideas
to
strike
out
sparks
or
receive
suggestions
she
did
not
mingle
with
people
of
her
own
calibre
at
all
herein
miss
burney
had
an
immense
advantage
over
her
from
her
babyhood
she
was
surrounded
by
men
and
women
of
distinction
her
father
himself
an
author
and
possessing
musical
talent
drew
to
his
house
all
sorts
of
persons
macaulay
says
it
would
be
tedious
to
recount
the
names
of
all
the
men
of
letters
and
artists
whom
fanny
burney
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
hearing
hundreds
of
remarkable
persons
had
passed
in
review
before
her
english
french
german
italian
lords
and
fiddlers
deans
of
cathedrals
and
managers
of
theatres
travellers
leading
about
newly
caught
savages
and
escorted
by
she
was
fêted
caressed
and
brought
forward
until
she
accepted
the
appointment
at
the
court
which
condemned
her
to
a
weary
round
of
dull
duties
and
must
have
made
her
life
appear
like
a
draught
of
after
the
heady
champagne
to
which
she
was
accustomed
but
the
london
of
when
we
have
the
first
record
of
jane
s
visiting
it
was
not
what
it
had
been
thirty
years
before
johnson
was
dead
walpole
was
dead
garrick
was
dead
reynolds
was
dead
sheridan
living
but
sunk
in
debt
and
disease
of
the
brilliant
band
that
hannah
more
had
known
few
were
left
doctor
johnson
had
died
fourteen
years
previously
when
jane
was
only
nine
years
old
miss
burney
had
had
not
only
his
friendship
but
his
help
in
the
revision
of
her
a
doubtful
privilege
to
quote
lord
macaulay
again
when
she
wrote
her
early
journals
and
her
novel
of
her
style
was
not
indeed
brilliant
or
energetic
but
it
was
easy
clear
and
free
from
all
offensive
faults
when
she
wrote
she
aimed
higher
she
had
then
lived
much
in
a
circle
of
which
johnson
was
the
centre
and
she
was
herself
one
of
his
most
submissive
worshippers
in
an
evil
hour
the
author
of
took
the
for
her
model
she
had
her
style
it
was
a
tolerably
good
one
she
determined
to
throw
it
away
to
adopt
a
style
in
which
she
could
attain
excellence
only
by
achieving
an
almost
miraculous
victory
over
nature
and
over
habit
in
the
imitation
of
johnson
though
not
always
in
the
best
taste
is
sometimes
eminently
happy
there
were
people
who
whispered
that
johnson
had
assisted
his
young
friend
and
that
the
novel
owed
all
its
finest
passages
to
his
hand
this
was
merely
the
fabrication
of
but
after
the
death
of
johnson
she
had
to
write
in
johnson
s
manner
without
johnson
s
aid
the
consequence
was
that
in
every
passage
which
she
meant
to
be
fine
is
detestable
and
that
the
book
has
been
saved
from
condemnation
only
by
the
admirable
spirit
and
force
of
those
scenes
in
which
she
was
content
to
be
after
he
had
read
walpole
says
of
miss
burney
alas
she
had
reversed
experience
which
i
have
long
thought
reverses
its
own
utility
by
coming
at
the
wrong
end
of
our
life
when
we
do
not
want
it
this
author
knew
the
world
and
penetrated
characters
before
she
had
stepped
over
the
threshold
now
she
has
seen
so
much
of
it
she
has
little
or
no
insight
at
it
was
therefore
perhaps
lucky
for
jane
austen
that
she
was
not
so
overshadowed
by
the
direct
personality
of
a
mighty
man
as
to
lose
her
clear
bright
english
style
her
admiration
for
miss
burney
s
work
was
decided
and
clearly
expressed
and
she
was
among
the
first
subscribers
to
in
though
jane
never
came
into
contact
with
the
men
and
women
who
made
literature
in
her
day
she
took
a
keen
interest
in
their
works
and
was
a
great
novel
reader
she
says
in
one
place
as
an
inducement
to
subscribe
to
her
library
martin
tells
me
that
her
collection
is
not
to
consist
only
of
novels
but
of
every
kind
of
literature
she
might
have
spared
this
pretension
to
our
family
who
are
great
novel
readers
and
not
ashamed
of
being
there
are
frequent
references
to
novels
in
her
letters
we
have
got
my
father
has
bought
it
against
my
private
wishes
for
it
does
not
quite
satisfy
my
feelings
that
we
should
purchase
the
only
one
of
egerton
s
works
of
which
his
family
are
in
another
place
to
set
against
your
new
novel
of
which
nobody
ever
heard
before
and
perhaps
never
may
again
we
have
got
of
by
miss
owenson
which
must
be
very
clever
because
it
was
written
the
authoress
says
in
three
months
we
have
only
read
the
preface
yet
but
her
irish
girl
does
not
make
me
expect
much
if
the
warmth
of
her
language
could
affect
the
body
it
might
be
worth
reading
this
january
there
were
many
writers
thought
highly
of
at
the
time
of
their
writing
who
have
yet
dropped
into
oblivion
to
all
but
the
student
among
these
is
jane
porter
born
a
year
later
than
jane
austen
who
published
her
first
romance
of
in
this
was
a
great
success
and
immediately
ran
through
several
editions
it
was
followed
in
by
her
d
scottish
in
when
it
had
just
come
out
and
was
anonymous
hannah
more
s
in
search
of
a
came
into
cassandra
s
hands
jane
writes
of
it
you
have
by
no
means
raised
my
curiosity
after
caleb
my
disinclination
for
it
before
was
affected
but
now
it
is
real
i
do
not
like
the
evangelicals
of
course
i
shall
be
delighted
when
i
read
it
like
other
people
but
till
i
do
i
dislike
and
in
her
next
letter
she
replies
to
her
sister
i
am
not
at
all
ashamed
about
the
name
of
the
novel
having
been
guilty
of
no
insult
towards
your
handwriting
the
diphthong
i
always
saw
but
knowing
how
fond
you
were
of
adding
a
vowel
wherever
you
could
i
attributed
it
to
that
alone
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
does
the
book
no
service
the
only
merit
it
could
have
was
in
the
name
of
caleb
which
has
an
honest
unpretending
sound
but
in
cœlebs
there
is
pedantry
and
affectation
is
it
written
only
to
classical
scholars
itself
it
must
be
admitted
is
dull
unqualifiedly
dull
jane
austen
s
own
books
are
not
novels
of
plot
but
they
radiate
plot
in
comparison
in
a
procession
of
persons
stalks
solemnly
through
the
pages
they
never
reveal
themselves
by
action
but
are
described
as
by
a
greek
chorus
by
the
other
characters
in
conversation
or
by
the
author
while
long
dry
disquisitions
on
religion
fill
half
or
more
than
half
of
the
book
and
cœlebs
himself
is
a
prig
of
the
first
water
yet
there
are
certain
little
touches
which
indicate
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
such
as
that
of
the
man
who
has
married
a
beauty
who
had
no
one
recommendation
but
beauty
to
be
admired
by
her
whom
all
his
acquaintance
admired
gratified
his
a
book
called
which
appeared
in
by
mary
brunton
the
wife
of
a
scotch
minister
had
a
fair
measure
of
success
and
was
reprinted
as
lately
as
jane
speaks
very
slightingly
of
it
i
am
looking
over
again
and
my
opinion
is
confirmed
of
its
being
an
excellently
meant
elegantly
written
work
without
anything
of
nature
or
probability
in
it
i
declare
i
do
not
know
whether
laura
s
passage
down
the
american
river
is
not
the
most
natural
possible
thing
she
ever
miss
mitford
in
regard
to
this
book
quotes
the
opinions
of
two
men
one
of
whom
said
it
ought
to
be
burnt
by
the
common
hangman
and
the
other
that
it
ought
to
be
written
in
letters
of
gold
which
shows
that
public
opinion
was
as
various
in
those
days
as
it
is
in
these
in
jane
mentions
a
novel
of
sarah
burney
s
who
was
a
younger
sister
of
the
famous
miss
burney
though
the
same
author
brought
out
another
novel
later
it
was
evidently
only
because
she
followed
in
her
sister
s
wake
and
not
from
any
inherent
ability
jane
says
we
are
reading
and
are
surprised
to
find
how
foolish
it
is
i
remember
liking
it
much
less
on
a
second
reading
than
at
the
first
and
it
does
not
bear
a
third
at
all
it
is
full
of
unnatural
conduct
and
forced
difficulties
without
striking
merit
of
any
but
these
impressions
of
books
are
hardly
worth
recording
except
as
specimens
of
the
quantities
of
worthless
novels
to
be
had
at
the
libraries
then
samuel
rogers
says
lane
made
a
large
fortune
by
the
immense
quantity
of
trashy
novels
which
he
sent
forth
from
the
minerva
press
i
perfectly
well
remember
the
splendid
carriage
in
which
he
used
to
ride
and
his
footmen
with
their
cockades
and
canes
as
soon
as
a
novel
has
had
its
run
and
is
beginning
to
be
forgotten
out
comes
an
edition
of
it
as
a
standard
in
miss
mitford
s
life
is
given
a
list
of
the
books
which
she
had
from
the
circulating
library
in
a
month
and
which
she
presumably
read
when
she
was
a

just
back

century
edmund
gosse
says
the
flourishing
period
of
the
eighteenth
century
novel
lasted
exactly
years
during
which
time
we
have
to
record
the
publication
of
no
less
than
fifteen
eminent
works
of
fiction
the
fifteen
are
naturally
divided
into
three
groups
the
first
contains
sarah
fielding
and
in
these
books
the
art
is
still
somewhat
crude
and
the
science
of
fiction
incompletely
understood
after
a
silence
of
five
years
we
reach
the
second
and
greatest
section
of
this
central
period
during
which
there
appeared
in
quick
succession
and
charles
there
followed
another
silence
of
five
years
and
then
were
issued
each
on
the
heels
of
the
other
castle
of
and
vicar
of
years
later
and
then
with
one
or
two
such
exceptions
as
and
no
great
novel
appeared
again
in
england
for
forty
years
until
in
the
new
school
of
fiction
was
inaugurated
by
and
though
we
may
not
agree
entirely
with
gosse
s
classification
this
paragraph
is
suggestive
as
we
have
seen
in
her
brother
s
record
jane
s
favourites
in
prose
and
poetry
respectively
were
johnson
and
cowper
these
two
are
mentioned
in
one
sentence
of
hers
we
have
got
boswell
s
to
the
and
are
to
have
his
of
and
as
some
money
will
yet
remain
in
burdon
s
hands
it
is
to
be
laid
out
in
the
purchase
of
cowper
s
she
warmly
admired
cowper
which
is
hardly
wonderful
for
with
some
manifest
differences
cowper
was
trying
to
do
in
poetry
what
she
did
in
prose
he
was
utterly
lacking
of
course
in
her
light
vivacity
of
touch
and
sense
of
humour
but
he
did
genuinely
try
to
describe
what
he
saw
not
what
he
merely
knew
by
hearing
the
green
fields
and
full
rivers
of
the
olney
country
are
depicted
with
fidelity
to
detail
and
clearness
of
line
cowper
was
born
in
but
his
first
volume
of
verse
was
not
published
until
and
it
was
not
until
appeared
a
year
or
two
later
with
in
the
same
volume
that
he
really
came
to
his
own
in
jane
writes
my
father
reads
cowper
to
us
in
the
morning
to
which
i
listen
when
i
this
implies
no
disparagement
of
the
poet
but
merely
that
her
numerous
household
duties
did
not
always
allow
her
time
to
listen
in
morland
s
picture
domestic
happiness
we
have
a
scene
which
helps
us
to
realise
the
family
group
at
these
readings
the
mother
and
daughter
in
their
caps
with
and
white
kerchiefs
are
dressed
as
jane
and
her
mother
must
have
been
and
the
plain
simplicity
of
the
part
of
the
room
shown
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
rectory
environment
illustration
domestic
happiness
another
of
jane
s
favourite
poets
was
crabbe
crabbe
and
cowper
are
both
rather
heavy
reading
and
of
both
it
may
be
said
that
their
poetry
is
not
poetical
but
they
are
honestly
seeking
after
truth
and
thus
they
attracted
jane
austen
they
were
amongst
the
earliest
of
the
natural
school
which
used
the
method
of
realism
crabbe
had
a
bitter
struggle
to
obtain
a
hearing
but
his
struggle
was
over
before
burke
had
taken
him
up
and
in
those
days
much
depended
on
a
patron
in
he
had
published
two
years
after
and
two
years
later
again
came
and
then
he
did
not
bring
out
anything
more
until
it
is
of
course
very
difficult
to
give
any
picture
of
contemporary
literature
in
jane
austen
s
time
without
degenerating
into
mere
strings
of
names
the
fact
that
she
herself
came
in
contact
with
no
one
of
the
first
rank
in
literature
prevents
any
of
the
characters
from
being
woven
into
her
life
the
books
she
mentions
as
having
read
are
a
mere
drop
in
the
ocean
compared
with
the
books
which
came
out
in
her
time
and
which
she
probably
in
some
cases
almost
certainly
read
it
was
a
brilliant
age
as
regards
writing
perhaps
the
best
way
to
give
some
general
idea
of
those
writers
not
already
mentioned
will
be
to
divide
the
time
into
three
sections
and
without
any
attempt
at
being
exhaustive
to
mention
generally
the
leading
names
among
the
writers
who
lived
on
into
her
epoch
but
whose
best
work
had
been
published
before
her
time
those
who
actually
were
contemporary
in
the
sense
that
their
books
by
which
their
names
are
known
were
published
in
her
lifetime
and
those
whose
names
had
not
begun
to
be
known
when
she
died
though
the
owners
were
born
in
her
epoch
first
then
those
whose
work
was
done
foremost
among
these
was
johnson
who
has
already
been
mentioned
walpole
was
considerably
past
at
her
birth
and
died
in
wesley
s
collected
came
out
in
and
he
died
in
adam
smith
preceded
him
by
a
year
the
seventies
in
the
eighteenth
century
produced
numerous
brilliant
men
and
women
whose
names
still
live
besides
jane
austen
herself
we
have
sir
walter
scott
hazlitt
sydney
smith
lamb
sir
humphry
davy
coleridge
southey
wordsworth
hogg
thomas
moore
and
thomas
campbell
who
were
all
born
in
this
decade
though
as
the
development
of
a
writer
differs
enormously
in
growth
some
of
them
were
much
later
in
making
their
appearance
in
print
than
others
among
the
better
known
names
of
women
novelists
not
already
mentioned
we
have
miss
edgeworth
jane
austen
s
senior
by
eight
years
whose
first
novel
was
published
anonymously
in
that
jane
knew
and
admired
her
work
is
obvious
from
the
fact
that
she
sent
her
a
copy
of
for
a
present
on
its
publication
inchbald
born
in
was
at
first
known
as
an
actress
her
by
which
she
is
best
remembered
was
published
in
radcliffe
whose
romances
induced
jane
austen
to
write
in
mockery
was
very
busy
between
and
during
which
time
she
published
five
novels
including
her
famous
of
in
joanna
baillie
published
a
volume
of
verse
in
and
her
first
volume
of
plays
in
though
almost
forgotten
now
she
was
taken
very
seriously
in
her
time
and
her
play
was
produced
at
drury
lane
in
by
siddons
and
kemble
anna
seward
who
was
born
in
lived
to
she
like
hannah
more
was
far
more
praised
and
valued
than
any
of
her
poor
little
productions
warranted
sheridan
brought
out
his
famous
play
in
the
year
of
jane
s
birth
it
was
at
first
a
dead
failure
but
nothing
daunted
he
cut
it
about
and
altered
it
and
when
reproduced
two
years
subsequently
it
attained
success
at
once
the
same
year
saw
school
for
and
the
following
one
in
this
year
also
the
first
volume
of
gibbon
s
great
history
appeared
burns
who
had
written
some
of
his
best
work
while
jane
was
still
a
child
died
in
and
the
brilliant
burke
the
succeeding
year
just
to
give
some
general
idea
of
the
wonderful
fruitfulness
of
this
epoch
it
may
also
be
mentioned
that
samuel
rogers
of
came
out
in
including
coleridge
s
and
some
of
wordsworth
s
poems
in
campbell
s
of
in
byron
was
thirteen
years
younger
than
jane
yet
his
precocity
was
so
great
that
his
first
book
of
was
produced
in
the
first
two
cantos
of
followed
in
but
the
whole
poem
was
not
completed
until
jane
was
in
her
grave
the
she
must
have
known
as
new
books
a
year
or
two
before
her
death
southey
s
came
out
in
the
first
year
of
the
new
century
and
thomas
moore
published
the
first
of
his
in
scott
s
literary
career
began
with
the
publication
of
a
translation
of
burger
s
lenore
in
between
that
date
and
his
poems
appeared
at
intervals
and
in
his
first
great
novel
though
it
was
anonymous
jane
seems
to
have
discovered
the
secret
of
the
authorship
for
she
writes
walter
scott
has
no
business
to
write
novels
especially
good
ones
it
is
not
fair
he
has
fame
and
profit
enough
as
a
poet
and
ought
not
to
be
taking
the
bread
out
of
other
people
s
mouths
i
do
not
mean
to
like
if
i
can
help
it
but
i
fear
i
but
she
was
not
the
only
one
to
make
such
a
conjecture
for
miss
mitford
having
read
also
imputes
it
unhesitatingly
to
him
she
says
if
there
be
any
belief
in
internal
evidence
it
must
be
judging
by
these
two
specimens
the
secret
of
scott
s
anonymity
was
not
the
great
mystery
it
is
generally
imagined
to
have
been
the
third
period
that
of
the
great
men
who
were
actually
contemporary
with
jane
austen
though
she
was
unconscious
of
their
existence
as
they
did
not
win
their
laurels
until
after
her
death
is
of
course
much
less
interesting
and
may
be
quickly
dismissed
such
names
as
those
of
lingard
and
hallam
among
historians
mill
hazlitt
and
de
quincey
belong
by
right
of
birth
to
an
earlier
epoch
though
their
works
place
them
in
this
miss
ferrier
and
miss
mitford
too
were
not
much
younger
than
jane
austen
but
neither
had
brought
out
anything
noticeable
before
her
death
miss
ferrier
s
first
novel
made
its
appearance
in
and
though
miss
mitford
had
written
poems
her
first
appeared
in
the
s
only
in
as
we
have
seen
miss
mitford
was
a
scholar
at
the
same
school
as
jane
austen
though
many
years
later
she
was
also
a
native
of
jane
s
county
hants
in
the
last
decade
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
born
among
poets
shelley
keats
hood
keble
and
hemans
among
historians
grote
alison
napier
carlyle
and
thirlwall
among
men
of
science
faraday
and
lyell
and
among
novelists
marryat
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
have
a
string
of
great
names
a
trio
of
poets
tennyson
longfellow
and
browning
men
of
science
such
as
darwin
historians
such
as
macaulay
novelists
in
numbers
such
as
dickens
thackeray
charles
reade
harrison
ainsworth
bulwer
lytton
and
trollope
statesmen
such
as
gladstone
and
disraeli
perhaps
no
forty
years
that
could
have
been
chosen
at
any
period
of
english
history
would
have
covered
such
a
variety
of
talent
and
that
of
such
a
high
order
as
was
given
to
the
world
during
jane
austen
s
brief
life
and
if
she
did
not
know
personally
the
men
whose
names
have
lived
with
her
own
at
all
events
she
drew
from
their
works
inspiration
and
knowledge
and
she
herself
was
not
by
any
means
the
least
among
so
mighty
a
company
chapter
x
a
trio
of
novels
when
jane
returned
home
in
october
after
her
pleasant
visit
to
godmersham
she
began
her
first
real
novel
she
was
then
nearly
and
the
girlish
scribblings
in
which
she
had
delighted
began
to
be
shaped
into
something
more
coherent
this
very
visit
with
all
its
bright
intercourse
all
its
pleasant
variety
she
had
been
thrown
among
a
set
of
county
people
of
better
social
standing
than
those
she
usually
saw
have
quickened
the
germ
and
been
the
cause
of
her
development
the
book
was
at
first
called
and
under
this
title
she
herself
frequently
refers
to
it
but
some
time
later
she
it
by
the
name
under
which
it
was
published
the
idea
that
the
name
and
was
suggested
by
some
sentences
at
the
end
of
has
been
mooted
and
though
arguments
against
this
supposition
have
been
found
it
appears
extremely
probable
for
in
it
is
declared
the
whole
of
this
unfortunate
affair
has
been
the
result
of
pride
and
prejudice
which
last
words
are
repeated
twice
on
the
same
page
each
time
in
large
type
so
that
they
catch
the
eye
itself
might
well
have
borne
this
title
in
reference
to
the
pride
and
prejudice
of
the
delvile
family
the
book
was
published
in
and
we
know
that
jane
had
a
great
admiration
for
miss
burney
s
work
in
it
some
time
subsequently
it
may
very
easily
have
struck
her
that
pride
and
prejudice
was
an
improvement
on
her
own
more
title
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
adopting
it
the
repetition
of
two
striking
qualities
and
the
alliteration
may
further
have
given
rise
to
and
which
also
replaced
an
earlier
title
of
and
and
was
apparently
written
solely
to
gratify
the
instincts
of
the
writer
without
any
thought
of
publication
but
after
it
was
completed
a
year
later
november
jane
s
father
wrote
for
her
to
the
publisher
cadell
as
follows
sir
have
in
my
possession
a
manuscript
novel
comprising
vols
about
the
length
of
miss
burney
s
as
i
am
well
aware
of
what
consequence
it
is
that
a
work
of
this
sort
should
make
its
first
appearance
under
a
respectable
name
i
apply
to
you
i
shall
be
much
obliged
therefore
if
you
will
inform
me
whether
you
choose
to
be
concerned
in
it
what
will
be
the
expense
of
publishing
it
at
the
author
s
risk
and
what
you
will
venture
to
advance
for
the
property
of
it
if
on
perusal
it
is
approved
of
should
you
give
any
encouragement
i
will
send
you
the
this
proposal
modest
as
it
is
was
rejected
by
return
of
post
one
would
have
thought
that
the
success
of
miss
burney
s
books
would
have
made
a
leading
publisher
anxious
to
look
at
a
work
on
similar
lines
but
and
was
destined
not
to
be
published
until
sixteen
years
later
as
we
have
said
it
is
unanimously
accorded
the
premier
place
amongst
jane
austen
s
novels
partly
because
it
is
full
of
that
brilliancy
and
sparkle
which
are
its
author
s
greatest
characteristics
and
partly
because
of
the
inimitable
character
of
elizabeth
bennet
whose
combined
archness
and
intelligence
captivate
everyone
elizabeth
is
the
embodiment
of
the
heroine
so
many
authors
have
tried
to
draw
witty
without
being
pert
having
a
reasonable
conceit
of
herself
without
vanity
and
a
natural
gaiety
of
heart
that
makes
her
altogether
lovable
whether
she
is
repelling
the
patronage
of
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
or
chaffing
the
sombre
darcy
she
is
equally
delightful
her
first
scene
with
lady
catherine
embodies
much
are
any
of
your
younger
sisters
out
miss
bennet
yes
ma
am
all
what
all
five
out
at
once
very
odd
and
you
only
the
second
the
younger
ones
out
before
the
elder
are
married
your
younger
sisters
must
be
very
young
yes
the
youngest
is
not
sixteen
perhaps
she
is
full
young
to
be
much
in
company
but
really
ma
am
i
think
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
younger
sisters
that
they
should
not
have
their
share
of
society
and
amusement
because
the
elder
may
not
have
the
means
or
inclination
to
marry
early
the
last
born
has
as
good
a
right
to
the
pleasures
of
youth
as
the
first
and
to
be
kept
back
on
such
a
motive
i
think
it
would
not
be
very
likely
to
promote
sisterly
affection
or
delicacy
of
upon
my
word
said
her
ladyship
you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
for
so
young
a
person
pray
what
is
your
age
with
three
younger
sisters
grown
up
replied
elizabeth
smiling
your
ladyship
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
and
again
when
lady
catherine
comes
to
ask
if
the
report
of
her
nephew
s
engagement
to
elizabeth
is
true
if
you
believed
it
impossible
to
be
true
said
elizabeth
colouring
with
astonishment
and
disdain
i
wonder
you
took
the
trouble
of
coming
so
far
what
could
your
ladyship
propose
by
it
at
once
to
insist
on
having
such
a
report
universally
your
coming
to
langbourn
to
see
me
and
my
family
said
elizabeth
coolly
will
be
rather
a
confirmation
of
it
if
indeed
such
a
report
is
in
if
do
you
then
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
it
has
it
not
been
industriously
circulated
by
yourselves
do
you
not
know
that
such
a
report
is
spread
abroad
i
never
heard
that
it
and
can
you
likewise
declare
there
is
no
foundation
for
it
i
do
not
pretend
to
possess
equal
frankness
with
your
ladyship
you
may
ask
questions
which
i
shall
not
choose
to
this
is
not
to
be
borne
miss
bennet
i
insist
on
being
satisfied
has
he
has
my
nephew
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage
your
ladyship
has
declared
it
to
be
her
verbal
encounters
with
darcy
are
equally
characteristic
elizabeth
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile
your
examination
of
darcy
is
over
i
presume
said
miss
bingley
and
pray
what
is
the
result
i
am
perfectly
convinced
by
it
that
darcy
has
no
defect
he
owns
it
himself
without
no
said
darcy
i
have
made
no
such
pretension
i
have
faults
enough
but
they
are
not
i
hope
of
understanding
my
temper
i
dare
not
vouch
for
it
is
i
believe
too
little
yielding
certainly
too
little
for
the
convenience
of
the
world
i
can
not
forget
the
follies
and
vices
of
others
so
soon
as
i
ought
nor
their
offences
against
myself
my
feelings
are
not
puffed
about
with
every
attempt
to
move
them
my
temper
would
perhaps
be
called
resentful
my
good
opinion
once
lost
is
lost
for
is
a
failing
indeed
cried
elizabeth
implacable
resentment
a
shade
in
a
character
but
you
have
chosen
your
fault
well
i
really
can
not
at
it
you
are
safe
from
there
is
i
believe
in
every
disposition
a
tendency
to
some
particular
evil
a
natural
defect
which
not
even
the
best
education
can
and
defect
is
a
propensity
to
hate
and
yours
he
replied
with
a
smile
is
wilfully
to
misunderstand
darcy
by
the
way
is
one
of
the
least
attractive
of
the
principal
men
characters
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
man
with
the
remotest
pretension
to
gentlemanly
feeling
should
say
even
to
himself
much
less
aloud
in
a
on
having
his
attention
called
to
a
young
girl
sitting
out
which
do
you
mean
and
turning
round
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
elizabeth
till
catching
her
eye
he
withdrew
his
own
and
coldly
said
she
is
tolerable
but
not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
me
and
i
am
in
no
humour
at
present
to
give
consequence
to
young
ladies
who
are
slighted
by
other
indeed
darcy
s
whole
character
is
so
averse
from
anything
usually
associated
with
the
word
gentleman
that
one
wonders
where
miss
austen
found
her
prototype
possibly
he
was
one
of
the
few
characters
for
which
she
drew
entirely
on
her
imagination
in
saying
this
there
is
no
innuendo
that
in
other
cases
she
drew
straight
from
the
life
it
is
i
believe
very
few
novelists
who
ever
wish
to
do
such
a
thing
but
it
is
certainly
true
and
everyone
who
has
attempted
fiction
knows
it
that
nearly
every
character
in
a
book
has
some
prototype
in
real
life
some
man
or
woman
who
gave
the
first
indication
of
a
certain
character
the
personality
may
be
altered
entirely
it
may
be
only
one
small
quality
which
is
derived
from
the
prototype
but
it
is
nevertheless
that
person
who
brought
that
particular
character
into
existence
so
far
as
we
know
there
was
no
haughty
man
of
the
world
in
jane
austen
s
list
of
acquaintances
it
is
true
that
darcy
is
represented
as
behaving
much
better
when
his
pride
has
been
bitterly
stung
by
elizabeth
s
rejection
of
him
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
a
man
such
as
he
is
at
first
represented
could
have
had
sufficient
good
in
him
to
change
his
character
completely
as
the
effect
of
love
to
show
how
entirely
opinions
differ
it
is
amusing
to
quote
some
of
the
remarks
of
miss
mitford
who
wrote
in
the
year
after
the
publication
of
and
the
want
of
elegance
is
almost
the
only
want
in
miss
austen
i
have
not
read
her
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
in
every
line
of
and
in
every
word
of
elizabeth
the
entire
want
of
taste
which
could
produce
so
pert
so
worldly
a
heroine
as
the
beloved
of
such
a
man
as
darcy
wickham
is
equally
bad
oh
they
were
just
fit
for
each
other
and
i
can
not
forgive
that
delightful
darcy
for
parting
them
darcy
should
have
married
jane
he
is
of
all
the
admirable
characters
the
best
designed
and
the
best
sustained
i
quite
agree
with
you
in
preferring
miss
austen
to
miss
edgeworth
if
the
former
had
a
little
more
taste
a
little
more
perception
of
the
graceful
as
well
as
of
the
humorous
i
know
not
indeed
anyone
to
whom
i
should
not
prefer
her
there
is
none
of
the
hardness
the
cold
selfishness
of
miss
edgeworth
about
her
writings
she
is
in
a
much
better
humour
with
the
world
she
preaches
no
sermons
she
wants
nothing
but
the
of
the
female
character
to
be
a
perfect
novel
writer
miss
mitford
would
no
doubt
have
preferred
as
a
heroine
the
elegant
languishing
female
without
any
of
the
savour
of
originality
about
her
who
was
the
stereotyped
heroine
of
most
works
of
fiction
at
that
time
sir
walter
scott
in
the
of
makes
the
base
insinuation
that
elizabeth
having
refused
darcy
does
not
perceive
that
she
has
done
a
foolish
thing
until
she
accidentally
visits
a
very
handsome
seat
and
grounds
belonging
to
her
we
are
sure
from
what
we
know
of
lizzie
that
this
is
quite
unfounded
had
she
been
liable
to
any
undue
influence
of
that
sort
she
would
have
accepted
darcy
at
the
first
for
she
knew
very
well
all
about
his
position
and
estates
from
the
beginning
that
she
had
the
courage
and
good
sense
to
snub
him
speaks
much
more
forcibly
for
her
character
than
a
like
action
on
the
part
of
any
girl
similarly
circumstanced
would
do
now
for
then
a
position
gained
by
marriage
was
the
only
one
a
woman
could
hope
for
and
such
chances
were
few
and
far
between
when
as
we
have
seen
men
were
desperately
prudent
in
their
matrimonial
affairs
and
looked
on
marriage
more
as
a
well
considered
and
suitable
monetary
alliance
than
as
a
love
match
though
perhaps
the
actual
person
of
the
woman
was
not
always
such
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
them
as
it
seems
to
have
been
to
the
writer
of
the
following
contemporary
letter
i
thank
you
with
ye
utmost
gratitude
for
ye
good
offices
you
was
to
have
done
me
and
though
i
can
not
now
for
reasons
above
specifyd
accept
of
them
yet
i
hope
they
will
still
continue
in
reversion
not
that
i
have
any
schemes
for
ever
resuming
my
designs
upon
miss
on
ye
contrary
i
should
be
very
loth
she
should
wait
so
long
but
because
whenever
my
time
is
come
you
are
ye
first
person
i
should
apply
to
as
having
a
good
number
of
friends
and
correspondents
and
none
who
are
priviledged
with
ye
intimacy
of
jennings
can
fail
of
accomplishments
to
render
them
highly
agreable
to
your
most
obedient
kentish
country
the
character
of
the
solemn
pompous
collins
is
the
best
of
the
kind
jane
ever
drew
he
is
a
creation
whose
name
might
signify
a
quality
of
perhaps
within
the
limits
possible
for
quotation
there
is
nothing
which
in
so
short
a
space
sums
up
so
well
his
inimitable
character
as
the
letter
of
condolence
he
sends
to
bennet
on
the
occasion
of
lydia
s
having
eloped
with
the
weak
and
untrustworthy
wickham
i
feel
myself
called
upon
by
our
relationship
and
my
situation
in
life
to
condole
with
you
on
the
grievous
affliction
you
are
now
suffering
under
of
which
we
were
yesterday
informed
by
a
letter
from
hertfordshire
be
assured
my
dear
sir
that
collins
and
myself
sincerely
sympathise
with
you
and
all
your
respectable
family
in
your
present
distress
which
must
be
of
the
bitterest
kind
because
proceeding
from
a
cause
which
no
time
can
remove
no
arguments
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
that
can
alleviate
so
severe
a
misfortune
or
that
can
comfort
you
under
a
circumstance
that
must
be
of
all
others
most
afflicting
to
a
parent
s
mind
the
death
of
your
daughter
would
have
been
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
this
and
it
is
the
more
to
be
lamented
because
there
is
reason
to
suppose
as
my
dear
charlotte
informs
me
that
this
licentiousness
of
behaviour
in
your
daughter
has
proceeded
from
a
faulty
degree
of
indulgence
though
at
the
same
time
for
the
consolation
of
yourself
and
bennet
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
her
own
disposition
must
be
naturally
bad
or
she
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
an
enormity
at
so
early
an
age
this
false
step
in
one
daughter
will
be
injurious
to
the
fortunes
of
all
the
others
for
who
as
lady
catherine
herself
condescendingly
says
will
connect
themselves
with
such
a
family
and
this
consideration
leads
me
to
reflect
with
augmented
satisfaction
on
a
certain
event
of
last
november
for
had
it
been
otherwise
i
must
have
been
involved
in
all
your
sorrow
and
disgrace
let
me
advise
you
then
my
dear
sir
to
console
yourself
as
much
as
possible
to
throw
off
your
unworthy
child
from
your
affection
for
ever
and
leave
her
to
reap
the
fruits
of
her
own
heinous
jane
s
own
impressions
of
and
are
given
in
a
letter
to
her
sister
written
many
years
later
on
the
publication
of
the
miss
dined
with
us
on
the
very
day
of
the
book
s
coming
and
in
the
evening
we
fairly
set
at
it
and
read
half
the
first
vol
to
her
she
was
amused
poor
soul
she
could
not
help
you
know
with
two
such
people
to
lead
the
way
but
she
really
does
seem
to
admire
elizabeth
i
must
confess
that
i
think
her
as
delightful
a
creature
as
ever
appeared
in
print
and
how
i
shall
be
able
to
tolerate
those
who
do
not
like
at
least
i
do
not
know
there
are
a
few
typical
errors
and
a
said
he
or
a
said
she
would
sometimes
make
the
dialogue
more
immediately
clear
but
i
do
not
write
for
such
dull
elves
as
have
not
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
themselves
our
second
evening
s
reading
to
miss
had
not
pleased
me
so
well
but
i
believe
something
must
be
attributed
to
my
mother
s
too
rapid
way
of
getting
on
though
she
perfectly
understands
the
characters
herself
she
can
not
speak
as
they
ought
upon
the
whole
however
i
am
quite
vain
enough
and
well
satisfied
enough
the
work
is
rather
too
light
and
bright
and
sparkling
it
wants
shade
it
wants
to
be
stretched
out
here
and
there
with
a
long
chapter
of
sense
if
it
could
be
had
if
not
of
solemn
specious
nonsense
about
something
unconnected
with
the
story
an
essay
on
writing
a
critique
on
walter
scott
or
the
history
of
buonaparte
or
something
that
would
form
a
contrast
and
bring
the
reader
with
increased
delight
to
the
playfulness
and
epigrammatism
of
the
general
and
later
in
reference
to
the
same
subject
she
i
am
exceedingly
pleased
that
you
can
say
what
you
do
after
having
gone
through
the
whole
work
and
fanny
s
praise
is
very
gratifying
my
hopes
were
tolerably
strong
of
but
nothing
like
a
certainty
her
liking
darcy
and
elizabeth
is
enough
she
might
hate
all
the
others
if
she
s
the
fact
that
jane
felt
the
extreme
brilliancy
and
lightness
of
her
own
work
shows
that
the
critical
faculty
was
active
in
her
but
as
for
wishing
to
do
away
with
it
in
order
to
bring
the
book
more
into
conformity
with
the
heavily
padded
novels
of
the
time
that
of
course
is
pure
nonsense
after
only
the
lapse
of
a
month
or
two
from
the
completion
of
jane
began
on
and
which
she
at
first
called
and
and
which
in
the
form
of
letters
had
been
written
long
before
probably
if
the
truth
were
known
this
might
be
called
her
first
long
story
and
it
was
in
any
case
the
first
published
the
story
in
letters
has
been
wittily
described
as
the
most
natural
but
the
most
improbable
form
and
certainly
though
this
style
of
novel
had
a
brief
renewal
of
popularity
a
year
or
two
ago
it
is
one
that
is
aggravating
to
most
readers
and
requires
many
clumsy
expedients
to
fill
in
gaps
in
order
to
make
the
story
hang
together
connectedly
miss
burney
had
employed
it
with
good
effect
in
but
even
here
the
story
would
have
run
much
better
told
straightforwardly
in
any
case
jane
was
well
advised
to
abandon
this
form
the
novel
was
finished
in
but
not
published
until
and
though
it
has
never
been
placed
first
in
position
among
jane
austen
s
novels
has
been
accounted
second
by
many
people
the
two
sisters
elinor
and
marianne
who
represent
sense
and
excessive
sensibility
are
finely
sketched
in
this
book
the
fact
that
jane
austen
s
leading
men
are
not
equal
to
her
leading
women
is
clearly
exemplified
austin
dobson
speaks
of
the
colourless
edward
ferrars
and
colonel
brandon
and
the
epithets
are
well
deserved
we
might
add
the
selfish
and
unchivalrous
willoughby
for
here
may
be
noted
a
defect
not
uncommon
in
an
inability
to
grasp
the
code
belonging
to
gentlemanly
conduct
this
is
noticeable
in
the
behaviour
ascribed
to
darcy
in
and
already
mentioned
but
it
is
worse
in
the
case
of
willoughby
who
is
supposed
to
be
brilliant
charming
and
a
gentleman
even
though
he
acts
badly
by
marianne
his
long
explanation
with
elinor
when
marianne
lies
on
a
and
he
himself
is
married
is
supposed
to
atone
for
his
bad
behaviour
at
all
events
it
is
made
to
exonerate
him
in
elinor
s
eyes
whereas
far
from
exonerating
him
in
the
eyes
of
any
ordinary
person
it
shows
him
in
a
worse
light
than
anything
that
has
preceded
it
is
only
a
scoundrel
or
cad
of
the
weakest
sort
who
speaks
slightingly
of
his
wife
though
unfortunately
the
code
for
women
is
different
and
many
a
woman
gives
away
her
husband
on
small
enough
grounds
yet
in
spite
of
one
of
the
most
stringent
and
least
frequently
infringed
rules
of
manly
conduct
we
find
willoughby
saying
apparently
without
any
debasement
in
his
creator
s
with
my
hand
and
heart
full
of
your
sister
i
was
forced
to
play
the
happy
lover
to
another
woman
marianne
beautiful
as
an
angel
on
one
side
and
sophia
jealous
as
the
devil
on
the
other
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
letter
sent
in
his
name
which
had
cut
poor
marianne
to
the
heart
was
dictated
by
his
wife
what
do
you
think
of
my
wife
s
style
of
letter
writing
it
not
and
in
excuse
for
his
marriage
in
honest
words
her
money
was
necessary
to
after
this
even
elinor
feels
bound
to
rebuke
him
saying
you
have
made
your
own
choice
it
was
not
forced
on
you
your
wife
has
a
claim
to
your
politeness
to
your
respect
at
do
not
talk
to
me
of
my
wife
he
replies
she
does
not
deserve
your
compassion
she
knew
i
had
no
regard
for
her
when
we
in
this
book
also
there
is
a
serious
blot
of
another
sort
a
violation
of
probabilities
which
suffices
to
score
a
heavy
mark
against
it
in
and
there
is
certainly
improbability
in
the
fact
that
two
portionless
girls
like
jane
and
elizabeth
bennet
should
find
such
husbands
as
bingley
and
darcy
but
the
improbability
is
lessened
by
the
fact
that
the
pair
of
men
were
friends
and
so
one
match
contributes
to
the
other
but
in
and
the
weak
subterfuge
for
getting
rid
of
lucy
price
to
whom
edward
holds
himself
in
honour
bound
is
hardly
credible
there
is
no
rational
explanation
of
the
obliging
conduct
of
robert
ferrars
edward
s
brother
to
make
a
man
so
vain
and
selfish
marry
a
woman
who
could
bring
him
nothing
and
whose
charms
were
not
great
is
a
poor
means
of
escaping
from
an
undesirable
deadlock
there
remain
a
few
other
points
for
comment
we
have
in
dashwood
one
of
the
silly
though
fond
mothers
that
jane
austen
delights
to
describe
in
jennings
we
have
the
comic
relief
not
so
clever
as
that
supplied
by
collins
in
and
or
by
miss
bates
in
a
little
too
coarse
for
many
people
but
still
true
enough
to
the
times
when
the
fact
of
a
man
s
paying
any
attention
to
a
girl
at
all
was
sufficient
to
make
the
gossips
discuss
their
marriage
and
settlement
in
life
with
all
openness
the
second
chapter
often
quoted
is
one
of
the
finest
scenes
in
the
whole
book
here
john
dashwood
mindful
of
his
promise
to
his
dying
father
suggests
giving
each
of
his
sisters
a
portion
of
one
thousand
pounds
out
of
the
magnificent
estate
which
has
come
to
him
under
the
entail
but
by
the
insidious
arguments
of
his
wife
he
at
last
settles
it
with
his
conscience
to
afford
them
such
assistance
as
looking
out
for
a
comfortable
small
house
for
them
helping
them
to
move
their
things
and
sending
them
presents
of
fish
and
game
and
so
forth
whenever
they
are
in
the
cottage
in
which
the
dashwoods
were
installed
at
barton
seems
greatly
to
have
resembled
the
cottage
at
chawton
as
a
house
barton
cottage
though
small
was
comfortable
and
compact
but
as
a
cottage
it
was
defective
for
the
building
was
regular
the
roof
was
tiled
the
were
not
painted
green
nor
were
the
walls
covered
with
honeysuckles
a
narrow
passage
led
directly
through
the
house
into
the
garden
behind
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
was
a
about
sixteen
feet
square
and
beyond
them
were
the
offices
and
the
stairs
four
bedrooms
and
two
garrets
formed
the
rest
of
the
house
it
had
not
been
built
many
years
and
was
in
good
but
as
and
was
written
long
before
jane
went
to
live
at
chawton
it
is
possible
this
account
of
the
cottage
was
interpolated
later
perhaps
when
she
revised
the
book
for
publication
in
on
the
whole
though
interesting
enough
and
does
not
take
very
high
rank
among
the
novels
was
begun
in
soon
after
the
completion
of
and
and
unlike
its
predecessors
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
based
on
existing
but
to
have
been
written
as
we
now
have
it
though
the
writing
was
spread
over
a
long
period
it
is
the
one
of
all
miss
austen
s
novels
about
which
opinions
differ
most
it
was
written
avowedly
as
a
skit
on
the
romantic
school
whose
high
priestess
was
radcliffe
but
as
austin
dobson
says
the
ironical
treatment
is
not
always
apparent
and
there
are
indications
that
as
often
happens
the
author
s
growing
interest
in
the
characters
diverts
her
from
her
this
is
true
enough
and
the
book
certainly
improves
in
consequence
as
it
goes
on
for
at
first
it
is
sententious
and
the
author
talks
aside
to
her
readers
and
explains
her
characters
in
a
way
that
she
does
nowhere
else
archbishop
whateley
remarks
that
it
is
decidedly
inferior
to
her
other
the
same
kind
of
excellences
that
characterise
the
other
novels
may
be
perceived
in
this
to
a
degree
which
would
have
been
highly
creditable
to
most
other
writers
of
the
same
school
and
which
would
have
entitled
the
author
to
considerable
praise
had
she
written
nothing
the
scene
of
is
laid
in
bath
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
very
well
acquainted
not
only
with
the
topography
but
with
the
manners
of
bath
jane
was
the
chattering
and
running
to
and
fro
from
pump
rooms
to
upper
or
lower
assembly
rooms
the
continual
meetings
and
the
saunterings
in
the
streets
with
all
the
affected
or
real
gaiety
and
the
magnifying
of
trifles
are
cleverly
sketched
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
book
the
sincere
but
foolish
little
heroine
with
her
contrast
to
and
intense
admiration
for
her
silly
and
selfish
friend
isabella
thorpe
is
a
figure
her
mother
is
one
of
the
very
few
elderly
ladies
who
are
allowed
to
be
sensible
in
jane
s
books
and
she
comes
in
so
little
as
to
be
a
very
minor
figure
the
account
of
bath
society
is
one
of
the
principal
features
of
the
book
another
is
that
it
abounds
perhaps
more
than
any
of
the
rest
in
those
three
or
four
line
summaries
which
express
so
admirably
reflections
situations
and
characters
thorpe
s
eldest
daughter
has
great
personal
beauty
and
the
younger
ones
by
pretending
to
be
as
handsome
as
their
sister
imitating
her
air
and
dressing
in
the
same
style
did
very
mrs
allen
was
now
quite
happy
quite
satisfied
with
bath
she
had
found
some
as
the
completion
of
good
fortune
had
found
these
friends
by
no
means
so
expensively
dressed
as
her
catherine
s
whole
family
were
plain
matter
of
fact
people
who
seldom
aimed
at
wit
of
any
kind
her
father
at
the
utmost
being
contented
with
a
pun
and
her
mother
with
a
the
advantages
of
natural
folly
in
a
beautiful
girl
have
been
already
set
forth
by
the
capital
pen
of
a
sister
author
and
to
her
treatment
of
the
subject
i
will
only
add
in
justice
to
men
that
though
to
the
larger
and
more
trifling
part
of
the
sex
imbecility
in
females
is
a
great
enhancement
of
their
personal
charms
there
is
a
portion
of
them
too
reasonable
and
too
well
informed
themselves
to
desire
anything
more
in
woman
than
the
miss
thorpe
is
sketched
with
particular
care
and
if
we
may
judge
from
other
contemporary
novels
including
this
was
by
no
means
an
uncommon
type
at
that
day
her
conversation
with
catherine
on
the
novels
she
had
read
is
worth
giving
at
length
she
asks
have
you
gone
on
with
yes
i
have
been
reading
it
ever
since
i
woke
and
i
am
got
to
the
black
are
you
indeed
how
delightful
oh
i
would
not
tell
you
what
is
behind
the
black
veil
for
the
world
are
not
you
wild
to
know
oh
yes
quite
what
can
it
be
but
do
not
tell
me
i
would
not
be
told
on
any
account
i
know
it
must
be
a
skeleton
i
am
sure
it
is
laurentina
s
skeleton
oh
i
am
delighted
with
the
book
i
should
like
to
spend
my
whole
life
in
reading
it
i
assure
you
if
it
had
not
been
to
meet
you
i
would
not
have
come
away
from
it
for
all
the
dear
creature
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
and
when
you
have
finished
we
will
read
the
together
and
i
have
made
out
a
list
of
ten
or
twelve
more
of
the
same
kind
for
have
you
indeed
how
glad
i
am
where
are
they
all
i
will
read
you
their
names
directly
here
they
are
in
my
of
of
the
black
of
the
and
those
will
last
us
some
yes
pretty
well
but
are
they
all
horrid
are
you
sure
they
are
all
horrid
yes
quite
sure
for
a
particular
friend
of
miss
sweet
girl
one
of
the
sweetest
creatures
in
the
world
has
read
every
one
of
them
i
wish
you
knew
miss
andrews
you
would
be
delighted
with
her
she
is
netting
herself
the
sweetest
cloak
you
can
conceive
i
think
her
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
i
am
so
vexed
with
the
men
for
not
admiring
her
i
scold
them
all
amazingly
for
scold
them
do
you
scold
them
for
not
admiring
her
yes
that
i
do
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
those
who
really
are
my
friends
i
have
no
notion
of
loving
people
by
halves
it
is
not
my
nature
my
attachments
are
always
excessively
strong
i
told
captain
hunt
at
one
of
our
assemblies
this
winter
that
if
he
was
to
tease
me
all
night
i
would
not
dance
with
him
unless
he
would
allow
miss
andrews
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
the
men
think
us
incapable
of
real
friendship
you
know
and
i
am
determined
to
show
them
the
and
shortly
after
she
exclaims
for
heaven
s
sake
let
us
move
away
from
this
end
of
the
room
do
you
know
there
are
two
odious
young
men
who
have
been
staring
at
me
this
half
hour
they
really
put
me
quite
out
of
countenance
let
us
go
and
look
at
the
arrivals
they
will
hardly
follow
us
in
a
few
moments
catherine
with
unaffected
pleasure
assured
her
that
she
need
not
be
any
longer
uneasy
as
the
gentlemen
had
just
left
the
pump
room
and
which
way
are
they
gone
said
isabella
turning
hastily
round
one
was
a
very
young
they
went
towards
the
well
i
am
amazingly
glad
i
have
got
rid
of
them
and
now
what
say
you
to
going
to
edgar
s
buildings
with
me
and
looking
at
my
new
hat
you
said
you
should
like
to
see
illustration
cowper
catherine
readily
agreed
only
she
added
perhaps
we
may
overtake
the
two
young
oh
never
mind
that
if
we
make
haste
we
shall
pass
by
them
presently
and
i
am
dying
to
show
you
my
but
if
we
only
wait
a
few
minutes
there
will
be
no
danger
of
our
seeing
them
at
i
shall
not
pay
them
any
such
compliment
i
assure
you
i
have
no
notion
of
treating
men
with
such
respect
that
is
the
way
to
spoil
catherine
had
nothing
to
oppose
against
such
reasoning
and
therefore
to
show
the
independence
of
miss
thorpe
and
her
resolution
of
humbling
the
sex
they
set
off
immediately
as
fast
as
they
could
walk
in
pursuit
of
the
two
young
perhaps
may
be
described
as
the
book
which
real
austenites
appreciate
most
but
which
the
casual
reader
does
not
admire
the
story
is
not
interesting
the
simplicity
of
catherine
rather
irritating
than
attractive
and
it
is
the
form
and
the
flashes
of
insight
in
the
book
that
make
it
so
enjoyable
the
writing
though
begun
in
spread
over
a
long
period
for
the
book
was
not
finished
until
by
which
time
jane
herself
was
settled
in
bath
it
was
then
offered
to
a
bath
bookseller
the
equivalent
of
a
publisher
in
our
day
he
gave
ten
pounds
for
it
probably
because
of
the
local
colour
but
evidently
after
reading
it
he
found
it
lacked
that
melodramatic
flavour
to
which
he
was
accustomed
and
it
is
also
highly
probable
that
he
did
not
at
all
comprehend
the
delightful
flavour
of
irony
the
book
remained
with
him
luckily
in
safety
until
thirteen
years
had
passed
when
it
was
bought
back
by
henry
austen
on
his
sister
s
account
for
the
same
sum
that
had
been
given
for
it
when
the
transaction
had
been
completed
he
told
the
bookseller
that
it
was
by
the
author
of
and
which
had
attracted
much
attention
whereat
the
man
must
have
experienced
the
regret
he
deserved
to
feel
as
he
had
missed
the
honour
of
introducing
jane
to
the
public
an
honour
that
would
have
linked
his
name
with
genius
the
book
did
not
appear
until
when
the
author
was
in
her
grave
and
it
was
the
first
to
bear
her
name
on
the
it
was
published
in
one
volume
with
the
last
of
her
writings
in
a
preface
written
before
her
death
she
says
of
years
have
made
it
comparatively
obsolete
places
manners
books
and
opinions
have
undergone
considerable
it
is
evident
therefore
she
did
not
attempt
to
bring
it
up
to
date
this
preface
is
prefixed
to
the
first
edition
as
is
also
the
biographical
memoir
by
her
brother
which
has
already
been
referred
to
the
few
closing
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
last
spent
at
steventon
while
these
three
works
were
in
hand
must
have
been
bright
ones
to
jane
she
had
found
an
outlet
for
all
the
vivacious
humour
that
was
in
her
and
must
have
lived
in
the
world
of
fancy
with
her
characters
which
were
all
very
real
to
her
quite
as
much
as
in
the
material
world
at
this
time
her
eldest
brother
james
was
living
not
far
off
and
on
november
his
wife
had
become
the
mother
of
a
boy
named
edward
it
was
he
who
afterwards
took
the
additional
name
of
leigh
affixed
to
that
of
austen
and
who
published
the
memoir
of
jane
austen
from
which
we
have
already
drawn
so
much
interesting
detail
how
little
could
jane
have
dreamt
that
night
when
her
brother
sent
over
a
note
to
tell
her
of
the
child
s
safe
arrival
in
the
world
that
more
than
a
hundred
years
later
the
work
of
that
boy
describing
her
as
one
of
the
world
s
famous
authoresses
would
be
read
eagerly
it
was
only
the
preceding
month
that
she
had
begun
to
work
on
the
first
of
her
delightful
books
when
she
went
to
see
the
new
baby
she
was
allowed
a
glimpse
of
him
while
he
was
asleep
and
was
told
that
his
eyes
were
large
dark
and
what
a
subject
for
a
picture
she
in
her
girlishness
quaintly
dressed
bending
over
the
cot
of
the
infant
quite
as
unconscious
of
all
that
was
to
come
as
even
the
baby
itself
chapter
xi
the
navy
the
last
few
years
of
the
century
which
passed
so
quietly
at
steventon
were
times
of
continual
change
and
stir
in
the
larger
world
a
world
in
which
both
francis
and
charles
austen
were
taking
an
active
part
but
except
for
the
personal
matters
that
affected
them
jane
does
not
refer
to
these
events
it
is
true
that
from
september
to
october
we
have
no
letters
of
hers
which
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
and
her
sister
were
not
much
parted
then
this
is
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
a
correspondence
carried
on
with
such
a
near
relation
but
subsequently
to
this
break
the
allusions
to
her
brothers
promotions
and
prospects
are
fairly
frequent
admiral
gambier
in
reply
to
my
father
s
application
writes
as
follows
as
it
is
usual
to
keep
young
officers
in
small
vessels
it
being
most
proper
on
account
of
their
inexperience
and
it
being
also
a
situation
where
they
are
more
in
the
way
of
learning
their
duty
your
son
has
been
continued
in
the
but
i
have
mentioned
to
the
board
of
admiralty
his
wish
to
be
in
a
frigate
and
when
a
proper
opportunity
offers
and
it
is
judged
that
he
has
taken
his
turn
in
a
small
ship
i
hope
he
will
be
removed
with
regard
to
your
son
now
in
london
i
am
glad
i
can
give
you
the
assurance
that
his
promotion
is
likely
to
take
place
very
soon
as
lord
spencer
has
been
so
good
as
to
say
he
would
include
him
in
an
arrangement
that
he
proposes
making
in
a
short
time
relative
to
some
promotions
in
that
there
i
may
now
finish
my
letter
and
go
and
hang
myself
for
i
am
sure
i
can
neither
write
or
do
anything
which
will
not
appear
insipid
to
you
after
again
frank
is
made
he
was
yesterday
raised
to
the
rank
of
commander
and
appointed
to
the
sloop
now
at
gibraltar
as
soon
as
you
have
cried
a
little
for
joy
you
may
go
on
and
learn
further
that
the
indian
house
have
taken
captain
austen
s
petition
into
consideration
and
likewise
that
lieutenant
charles
john
austen
is
removed
to
the
nearly
a
month
charles
leaves
us
the
is
in
the
downs
and
daysh
advises
him
to
join
her
there
directly
as
there
is
no
chance
of
her
going
to
the
westward
charles
does
not
approve
of
this
at
all
and
will
not
be
much
grieved
if
he
should
be
too
late
for
her
before
she
sails
as
he
may
then
hope
to
get
into
a
better
and
two
days
after
i
have
just
heard
from
charles
who
is
by
this
time
at
deal
he
is
to
be
second
lieutenant
which
pleases
him
very
well
he
expects
to
be
ordered
to
sheerness
shortly
as
the
has
never
been
frank
apparently
remained
on
the
until
he
received
promotion
in
the
beginning
of
for
his
sister
writes
jestingly
so
frank
s
letter
has
made
you
very
happy
but
you
are
afraid
he
would
not
have
patience
to
stay
for
the
which
you
wish
him
to
have
done
as
being
safer
than
the
merchantman
poor
fellow
to
wait
from
the
middle
of
november
to
the
end
of
december
and
perhaps
even
longer
it
must
be
sad
work
especially
in
a
place
where
the
ink
is
so
abominably
pale
what
a
surprise
to
him
it
must
have
been
on
october
to
be
visited
collared
and
thrust
out
of
the
by
captain
inglis
he
kindly
passes
over
the
poignancy
of
his
feelings
in
quitting
his
ship
his
officers
and
his
men
what
a
pity
it
is
that
he
should
not
be
in
england
at
the
time
of
his
promotion
because
he
certainly
would
have
had
an
appointment
so
everybody
says
and
therefore
it
must
be
right
for
me
to
say
it
too
had
he
been
really
here
the
certainty
of
the
appointment
i
dare
say
would
not
have
been
half
so
great
but
as
it
could
not
be
brought
to
the
proof
his
absence
will
always
be
a
lucky
source
of
the
real
name
of
the
ship
was
evidently
the
but
it
is
very
variously
spelt

other
writers

orthography

as
to
prevent

for
this

the

seen
active
service
when
only
a
lad
of
fifteen
and
both
brothers
frequently
took
part
in
the
small
actions
which
were
continually
occurring
on
the
seas
there
was
as
we
have
seen
six
years
difference
in
age
between
them
but
they
were
both
at
sea
during
some
of
the
most
glorious
years
in
the
whole
annals
of
england
in
spite
of
bad
provisions
bad
quarters
bad
discipline
all
of
which
will
be
again
referred
to
the
english
seamen
at
this
time
showed
pluck
and
energy
that
was
limitless

absolutely
supreme
on
the

in

in

than
a

which

of

of

an
attempt
to
retake

the
whole
of

they
sent
was
captured
by
admiral
elphinstone

spaniards
who
had
declared
war
against
great
britain
put
forth
their
full
naval
strength
to
attempt
to
raise
the
blockade
which
bound
the
ports
of

they
were
met
by
sir
john
jarvis
who
had
only
fifteen
ships
of
the
line
against
their
and
half
the
number
of
frigates
by
the
manœuvre
the
admiral
broke
the
spanish
line
cutting
off
a
number
of
their
ships
and
when
three
of
the
largest
wore
round
to
rejoin
their
comrades
they
were
met
by
nelson
and
collingwood
two
of
these
spanish
ships
got
entangled
with
each
other
and
nelson
driving
his
own
vessel
on
board
of
one
of
them
carried
both
sword
in
hand
and
received
the
sword
of
the
spanish
in
submission
this
was
afterwards
awarded
to
him
for
his
own
possession
the
spaniards
were
totally
routed
and
comparatively
few
ships
were
taken
the
battle
which
earned
its
commander
the
title
of
lord
vincent
is
considered
one
of
the
most
important
in
the
whole
history
of
england
in
october
of
the
same
year
the
battle
of
camperdown
was
gained
by
admiral
duncan
and
these
two
victories
together
by
making
the
british
complete
masters
of
the
home

allayed
for
a
while
the
terror
of
a
french
invasion
the
mezzotint
by
james
ward
from
copley
s
famous
picture
given
in
illustration
shows
the
variety
of
costume
adopted
by
the
british
seamen
at
that
time
the
style
of
the
officers
dress
and
gives
a
very
good
idea
of
the
appearance
of
the
picturesque
old
wooden
in
which
such
heroic
services
were
performed
the
most
amazing
part
of
this
splendid
series
of
victories
all
of
which
contained
much
boarding
and
fighting
demanding
personal
pluck
and
endurance
is
that
the
sailors
as
a
mass
were
either
unwilling
men
pressed
into
a
service
which
they
disliked
or
the
very
of
the
country
on
board
there
was
bad
food
bad
water
wretched
accommodation
and
often
rank
brutality
there
was
the
discipline
of
terror
not
of
respect
and
insubordination
was
only
held
down
by
fear
the
officers
fared
a
little
better
than
the
men
in
regard
to
comfort
but
it
speaks
well
for
young
charles
austen
that
he
followed
in
his
brother
s
steps
when
he
must
have
known
by
word
of
mouth
of
all
the
discomforts
to
speak
of
nothing
worse
which
must
be
his
lot
on
board
ship
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
the
first
entrance
into
the
navy
was
a
most
precarious
venture
and
the
system
if
system
it
can
be
called
so
haphazard
that
one
marvels
men
should
have
been
found
to
let
their
sons
attempt
it
a
boy
first
obtained
interest
of
some
sort
from
an
admiral
or
captain
on
board
a
ship
and
was
taken
by
him
in
any
odd
capacity
for
a
voyage
he
might
go
as
boy
or
even
as
servant
and
though
nominally
a
midshipman
was
in
reality
without
a
position
or
standing
save
what
his
patron
allowed
to
him
he
could
not
go
in
for
an
examination
until
he
had
served
on
board
for
six
years
then
he
might
do
so
to
qualify
for
a
lieutenancy
once
a
lieutenant
his
position
was
secured
and
he
had
authority
and
consequently
a
very
different
life
captain
edward
thompson
writing
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
a
young
relative
who
thought
of
following
the
sea
for
a
trade
says
besides
the
disagreeable
circumstances
and
situations
attending
a
subaltern
officer
in
the
navy
are
so
many
and
so
hard
that
had
not
the
first
men
in
the
service
passed
the
dirty
road
to
preferment
to
encourage
the
rest
they
would
renounce
it
to
a
man
it
is
a
most
mistaken
notion
that
a
youth
will
not
be
a
good
officer
unless
he
stoops
to
the
most
menial
offices
to
be
bedded
worse
than
hogs
and
to
eat
less
delicacies
in
short
from
having
experienced
such
scenes
of
filth
and
infamy
such
fatigues
and
hardships
that
are
sufficient
to
disgust
the
stoutest
and
bravest
for
alas
there
is
only
a
little
hope
of
promotion
sprinkled
in
the
cup
to
make
a
man
swallow
more
than
he
digests
the
rest
of
his
the
wonder
is
that
such
boys
as
went
to
sea
picked
up
enough
seamanship
to
pass
any
but
the
most
practical
examination
navigation
was
in
those
days
even
more
difficult
than
at
present
owing
to
the
dependence
on
the
wind
and
the
necessity
for
understanding
the
exact
management
of
sails
there
were
no
engineers
who
could
make
the
vessel
go
in
any
direction
the
captain
thought
best
at
a
moment
s
notice
and
the
man
on
the
bridge
had
a
heavy
responsibility
that
matters
in
regard
to
the
service
were
improving
is
evident
for
the
same
writer
quoted
above
the
last
war
a
chaw
of
tobacco
a
ratan
and
a
rope
of
oaths
were
sufficient
qualities
to
constitute
a
lieutenant
but
now
education
and
good
manners
are
the
study
of
yet
the
surroundings
on
board
ship
were
enough
to
prevent
any
but
the
most
earnest
and
determined
youth
from
studying
food
and
accommodation
were
alike
revolting
at
once
you
resign
a
good
table
for
no
table
and
a
good
bed
for
your
length
and
breadth
nay
it
will
be
thought
an
indulgence
too
to
let
you
sleep
where
day
ne
er
enters
and
where
fresh
air
only
comes
when
forced
you
must
get
up
every
four
hours
and
they
never
forget
to
call
you
though
you
may
forget
to
rise
your
light
for
day
and
night
is
a
small
candle
which
is
often
stuck
on
the
side
of
your
platter
at
meals
for
want
of
a
better
convenience
your
victuals
are
salt
and
often
bad
and
if
you
vary
the
mode
of
dressing
them
you
must
cook
yourself
in
a

have
the
collected
filth
of
jails

criminals

the
alternative
of
hanging
or
entering
on
board

is
not
a
vice
committed
on
shore
but
is
practised
here
the
scenes
of
horror
and
infamy
on
board
a
are
so
many
and
so
great
that
i
think
they
must
rather
disgust
a
good
mind
than
allure
smollet
s
pictures
of
life
on
board
are
too
well
known
to
quote
the
between
decks
where
the
men
slept

not
been
ventilated
at
all
up
to
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
a
was
invented
to
expel
the
foul
air
the
fresh
air
being
left
to
find
its
own
way
in
the
noisome
smells
the
cramped
space
the
continual
darkness
and
disorder
must
have
bred
sickness
and
debility
in
many
which
all
the
life
on
deck
could
not
counteract
as
for
the
food
served
for
the
men

seems
to
have
been
loathsome

relating
to
the
victualling
of

read
of

called

they
might
have
been
expended

raisins
as
wadding

butter
and
oil
to
grease
their
tackle
with
for
which
it
may
be
thought
very
slush
it
is
no
longer
a
wonder
at
the
pursers
being
tormented
with
execrations
and
bitter
wrath
from
remediless
aggrieved
and
tortured
men
on
it
is
said
that
any
man
who
had
been
long
a
sailor
got
into
the
habit
of
tapping
his
biscuit
on
the
table
to
knock
the
weevils
out
before
he
ate
it
a
trick
that
old
salts
were
seen
to
do
at
the
tables
of
their
friends
on
shore
as
for
the
state
of
the
hospitals
in
india
and
elsewhere
the
following
story
tells
a
tale
soon
after
the
last
action
with
the
french
fleet
i
observed
a
wounded
seaman
who
had
lost
part
of
his
hand
by
a
shot
climbing
up
the
side
with
one
hand
and
holding
his
bread
bag
in
his
teeth
i
asked
why
he
had
left
the
hospital
he
answered
they
were
so
much
in
want
of
provisions
that
he
had
come
on
board
to
beg
some
biscuit
which
was
full
of
maggots
for
his
messmates
at
that
time
i
understood
government
was
charged
a
rupee
a
day
for
every
man
in
the
hospital
about
or
but
i
believe
seven
or
eight
pence
was
all
it
cost
the
contractor
for
their
provisions
and
it
was
reported
that
he
was
obliged
to
share
the
profits
with
the
admiral
and
his
secretary
said
to
amount
to
about
a
we
have
had
some
revelations
of
official
corruption
recently
but
there
is
nothing
to
compare
with
the
openly
recognised
stealing
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
so
late
as
a
minister
could
say
in
earnest
to
a
purser
who
had
been
a
commissary
and
complained
of
poverty
you
had
your
hand
in
the
bag
sir
why
did
you
not
help
yourself
and
help
themselves
everyone
apparently
did
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
enquiry
first
began
to
be
made
by
lord
vincent
who
set
himself
to
clean
this
augean
stable
there
being
a
prospect
of
a
vacancy
in
the
office
of
the
admiralty
a
satirical
correspondent
to
the
in
forwarded
the
following
list
of
qualities
essential
for
any
candidate
applying
he
should
know
nothing
of
a
ship
he
should
never
have
been
to
sea
he
should
be
ignorant
of
geography
he
should
be
ignorant
of
naval
tactics
he
should
never
attend
office
until
four
in
the
afternoon
he
should
be
unfit
for
business
every
day
he
should
be
very
regular
in
keeping
officers
waiting
for
orders
he
should
not
know
a
bumboat
from
a
three
decker
his
hair
should
always
be
well
dressed
and
his
head
should
be
empty
though
matters
were
bad
enough
for
the
officers
they
were
fifty
times
worse
for
the
men
and
it
is
not
at
all
singular
that
men
should
have
been
procured
with
difficulty
to
enter
a
service
where
they
were
liable
to
all
sorts
of
hardships
to
great
risk
of
life
where
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
an
irresponsible
commander
who
could
order
them
to
be
strung
up
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
given
any
number
of
lashes
he
thought
fit
where
they
could
be
hanged
for
disobeying
or
manifesting
the
smallest
revolt
to
this
tyrant
where
which
was
freely
distributed
to
officers
sometimes
never
reached
the
men
there
were
instances
of
fairly
due
to
the
men
being
held
over
for
a
year
or
more
as
not
worth
the
deficiency
of
men
was
as
we
have
seen
supplied
by
using
the
criminals
of
the
gaols
bounty
money
was
also
liberally
offered
the
authorities
realising
that
a
few
pounds
ready
money
were
likely
to
be
a
valuable
bribe
to
a
man
out
of
luck
the
james
s
remarks
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
five
pounds
bounty
and
two
pounds
extra
from
the
corporation
of
london
surely
no
tars
can
be
found
in
the
government
had
offered
thirty
shillings
a
head
which
was
augmented
by
various
towns
london
offering
forty
shillings
additional
and
edinburgh
shillings
in
a
prohibition
forbidding
seamen
to
serve
in
foreign
navies
was
issued
and
in
the
bounty
money
of
london
rose
to
two
pounds
for
an
ordinary
seaman
and
sixty
shillings
for
an
able
seaman
the
city
added
twenty
shillings
to
the
one
and
forty
shillings
to
the
other
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
in
and
in
the
total
bounties
in
some
places
even
amounted
to
thirty
pounds
a

an
act
was
passed
demanding
levies
of
men
from
the
whole
country
the
proportions
varying
according
to
the
size
of
the
county
or
port
from
yorkshire
more
than
a
thousand
were
demanded
in
addition
to
this
the
pressgang
was
hard
at
work
and
the
monstrous
injustice
perpetrated
by
it
makes
one
wonder
how
even
in
times
of
greatest
stress
it
could
have
been
allowed
the
difference
between
an
ordinary
press
and
a
hot
press
was
that
in
the
latter
all
protection
was
disregarded
and
men
of
every
sort
even
apprentices
usually
protected
by
law
were
seized
and
carried
off
to
serve
utterly
regardless
of
mercy
the
odd
part
of
it
is
that
when
it
was
found
to
be
inevitable
the
men
who
had
been
taken
against
their
will
plucked
up
spirit
and
performed
their
duties

procured
one
of
the
gangs
in
attempting
to
board
a
liverpool
trader
were
resisted
by
the
crew
when
a
desperate
affray
took
place
in
which
many
of
the
former
were
thrown
overboard
and
the
lieutenant
who
boarded
them
killed
by
a
shot
from
the
june
in
all
protection
from
the
operations
of
the
pressgang
was
suspended
even
in
the
case
of
the
coal
trade
for
one
month
to
counterbalance
all
the
manifold
disadvantages
of
service
in
the
navy
for
the
officers
at
least
there
were
some
attractions
that
of
was
very
great
for
a
man
might
literally
make
his
fortune
at
sea
in
a
few
years
by
lucky
captures
and
the
spirit
of
gambling
and
adventure
to
which
this
gave
rise
must
have
had
a
very
strong
effect
in
attracting
young
officers
the
account
of
the
sums
received
in
is
perfectly
amazing
the
best
haul
of
all
was
perhaps
the
a
spanish
ship
taken
long
before
the
austens
day
in
the
treasure
was
conveyed
to
london
in
twenty
waggons
with
the
british
colours
flying
over
those
of
spain
a
sight
that
would
confound
those
of
our
own
time
who
seem
to
think
the
true
way
to
celebrate
a
victory
is
to
give
compensation
to
those
who
have
provoked
war
and
brought
defeat
upon
themselves
the
share
of
one
ship
alone
the
amounted
to
over
and
the
proportion
given
to
the
ships
of
the
same
squadron
not
actually
present
amounted
to
nearly
the
value
of
the
taken
in
as
adjudged
to
the
captors
was
of
which
about
went
to
admiral
gell
february
each
captain
got
nearly
in
jane
tells
us
that
charles
has
received
for
his
share
of
the
privateer
and
expects
ten
pounds
more
but
of
what
avail
is
it
to
take
prizes
if
he
lays
out
the
produce
in
presents
to
his
sisters
he
has
been
buying
gold
chains
and
topaz
crosses
for
us
he
must
be
well
after
this
it
does
not
seem
so
strange
to
read
in
that
in
only
seven
years
anne
s
lover
wentworth
had
distinguished
himself
and
early
gained
the
other
step
in
rank
and
must
now
by
successive
captures
have
made
a
handsome
fortune
which
otherwise
strikes
oddly
on
our
ears
illustration
victory
of
lord
duncan
camperdown
the
abuses
in
the
navy
included
those
of
interest
which
in
those
days
honeycombed
every
branch
of
professional
life
lord
rodney
made
his
son
john
a
post
captain
after
he
had
been
a
midshipman
little
over
a
month
and
when
he
was
just
over
fifteen
years
old
but
this
at
a
time
when
boys
of
fourteen
held
commissions
in
the
guards
must
have
seemed
a
trifle
lybbe
powys
speaking
of
her
our
young
officer
is
what
i
fear
too
generally
young
men
in
the
army
are
gay
thoughtless
and
very
handsome
but
what
boy
of
fourteen
having
a
commission
in
the
guards
can
be
otherwise
of
speaks
of
the
baby
officers
and
some
of
the
sucking
colonels
of
the
guards
have
expressed
their
dislike
of
the
short
skirts
they
say
they
feel
as
if
they
were
going
to
be
a
peculiar
feature
of
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
beginning
of
nineteenth
centuries
was
the
tendency
to
mutiny
induced
doubtless
by
the
terrible
hardships
and
injustices
undergone
by
the
men
on
board
and
the
wonder
is
not
that
the
men
did
mutiny
but
that
they
endured
so
long
and
fought
so
splendidly
without
doing
so
some
of
the
mutineers
on
board
the
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
thus
described
by
an
they
were
the
noblest
fellows
with
the
most
undaunted
mien
i
ever
beau
ideal
of
british
sailors
tall
and
athletic
in
blue
jackets
red
waistcoats
and
trousers
white
as
driven
snow
their
hair
like
the
tail
of
the
lion
hung
in
a
queue
down
their
back
at
that
time
this
last
article
was
considered
as
indeed
it
really
was
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
thoroughbred
seaman
unfortunately
these
gallant
fellows
were
as
ignorant
as
they
were
impatient
and
the
custom
of
the
time
was
to
hang
everyone
who
should
dare
to
dispute
the
orders
of
his
superior
of
the
mutinies
the
most
serious
were
those
at
spithead
and
the
nore
which
followed
closely
upon
one
another
after
the
first
concessions
in
regard
to
pay
and
various
improvements
in
commissariat
were
granted
and
both
mutinies
were
put
down
firmly
and
sharply
but
they
were
followed
from
time
to
time
by
lesser
outbreaks
all
these
excitements
and
the
constant
changes
in
the
pay
of
officers
must
have
been
watched
with
interest
by
the
austen
family
whom
they
touched
so
nearly
jane
certainly
understood
the
best
type
of
naval
officer
and
had
no
little
admiration
and
affection
for
him
the
officers
in
her
novels
may
easily
be
divided
into
two
sorts
they
are
the
officers
of
the
old
school
of
which
admiral
crawford
in
to
whom
his
nephew
and
niece
were
indebted
for
their
bringing
up
is
a
prominent
example
here
is
the
aforesaid
niece
s
account
of
the
type
when
edmund
bertram
asks
her
whether
she
has
not
a
large
acquaintance
in
the
navy
among
admirals
large
enough
but
with
an
air
of
grandeur
we
know
very
little
of
the
inferior
ranks
post
captains
may
be
very
good
sort
of
men
but
they
do
not
belong
to
us
of
various
admirals
i
could
tell
you
a
great
deal
of
them
and
their
flags
and
the
gradation
of
their
pay
and
their
bickerings
and
jealousies
but
in
general
i
can
assure
you
that
they
are
all
passed
over
and
all
very
certainly
my
home
at
my
uncle
s
brought
me
acquainted
with
a
circle
of
admirals
of
rears
and
vices
i
saw
enough
now
do
not
be
suspecting
me
of
a
pun
i
price
fanny
s
father
who
is
in
the
marines
with
his
noise
and
his
oaths
and
his
coarseness
and
is
a
terrible
revelation
to
his
gentle
daughter
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
we
may
set
admiral
croft
in
a
polished
and
delightful
man
of
the
white
he
was
in
the
trafalgar
action
and
has
been
in
the
east
indies
since
he
has
been
stationed
there
i
believe
several
the
younger
generation
of
sailors
is
represented
charmingly
in
the
novels
from
fanny
s
admirable
straightforward
brother
william
who
when
he
came
to
mansfield
park
shortly
after
getting
promoted
to
his
lieutenancy
would
have
been
delighted
to
show
his
uniform
there
too
had
not
cruel
custom
prohibited
its
appearance
except
on
duty
so
the
uniform
remained
at
portsmouth
and
edmund
conjectured
that
before
fanny
had
any
chance
of
seeing
it
all
its
own
freshness
and
all
the
freshness
of
its
wearer
s
feelings
must
be
worn
away
for
what
can
be
more
unbecoming
or
more
worthless
than
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
who
has
been
a
lieutenant
a
year
or
two
and
sees
others
made
commanders
before
captain
wentworth
anne
s
lover
who
had
been
treated
so
cruelly
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
her
family
is
gallant
handsome
charming
a
man
of
the
world
without
having
lost
his
freshness
and
a
man
who
has
won
his
way
and
yet
been
unspoiled
by
flattery
he
is
one
of
the
best
of
jane
austen
s
heroes
chapter
xii
bath
at
the
end
of
austen
made
up
his
mind
to
put
his
son
james
into
the
rectory
at
steventon
as
and
himself
retire
to
live
at
bath
in
those
days
parents
were
not
quite
so
communicative
to
their
children
as
they
are
now
many
things
were
decided
without
being
discussed
in
full
family
conclave
as
propriety
dictates
at
present
and
the
change
of
plan
does
not
seem
to
have
been
mooted
to
the
girls
at
all
so
that
coming
in
one
day
from
a
walk
as
they
entered
the
room
their
mother
greeted
them
with
the
intelligence
well
girls
it
is
all
settled
we
have
decided
to
leave
steventon
and
go
to
to
jane
who
had
been
from
home
and
who
had
not
heard
much
before
about
the
matter
it
was
such
a
shock
that
she
fainted
away
she
loved
the
country
and
her
delight
in
natural
scenery
was
such
that
she
would
sometimes
say
it
must
form
one
of
the
delights
of
from
family
mss
quoted
by
constance
hill
in
austen
her
homes
and
her
the
break
up
of
the
home
of
one
s
childhood
is
no
trifling
matter
and
it
often
carries
with
it
removal
from
many
friends
and
neighbours
whose
society
has
become
an
integral
part
of
life
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
blow
was
severe
yet
jane
was
of
a
cheerful
disposition
a
disposition
that
could
make
its
own
happiness
anywhere
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
entered
with
alacrity
into
all
the
needful
preparations
she
wrote
not
long
after
i
get
more
and
more
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
our
removal
we
have
lived
long
enough
in
this
neighbourhood
the
basingstoke
balls
are
certainly
on
the
decline
there
is
something
interesting
in
the
bustle
of
going
away
and
the
prospect
of
spending
future
summers
by
the
sea
or
in
wales
is
very
delightful
for
a
time
we
shall
now
possess
many
of
the
advantages
which
i
have
often
thought
of
with
envy
in
the
wives
of
sailors
or
soldiers
it
must
not
be
generally
known
however
that
i
am
not
sacrificing
a
great
deal
in
quitting
the
country
or
i
can
expect
to
inspire
no
tender
interest
in
those
we
leave
austen
was
perfectly
justified
in
his
decision
to
stop
work
he
was
then
seventy
and
had
held
the
two
livings
for
years
his
son
james
was
ready
to
take
them
up
he
was
living
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
been
of
assistance
to
his
father
for
some
time
past
we
learn
this
from
many
casual
sentences
in
the
letters
such
as
the
following
james
called
by
my
father
s
desire
on
bayle
to
enquire
into
the
cause
of
his
being
so
horrid
bayle
did
not
attempt
to
deny
his
being
horrid
and
made
many
apologies
for
it
he
did
not
plead
his
having
a
drunken
self
he
talked
only
of
a
drunken
foreman
and
gave
hopes
of
the
tables
being
at
steventon
on
monday
se
nnight
austen
died
in
only
four
years
after
the
removal
which
shows
that
he
had
not
withdrawn
from
active
life
at
all
too
soon
in
giving
up
country
life
he
had
to
give
up
also
many
of
the
hobbies
in
which
he
had
taken
delight
his
pigs
and
his
sheep
could
not
accompany
him
to
bath
references
to
these
animals
often
occur
in
his
daughter
s
lively
letters
my
father
furnishes
him
edward
with
a
pig
from
cheesedown
it
is
already
killed
and
cut
up
but
it
is
not
to
weigh
more
than
nine
stone
the
season
is
too
far
advanced
to
get
him
a
larger
one
my
mother
means
to
pay
herself
for
the
salt
and
the
trouble
of
ordering
it
to
be
cured
by
the
spareribs
the
souse
and
the
mr
lyford
gratified
us
very
much
yesterday
by
his
praises
of
my
father
s
mutton
which
they
all
think
was
the
finest
that
was
ever
you
must
tell
edward
that
my
father
gave
shillings
apiece
to
seward
for
his
last
lot
of
in
bath
pigs
poultry
and
a
garden
would
be
impossible
but
there
would
be
compensating
advantages
the
country
life
had
but
narrow
interests
and
trifles
had
to
be
made
the
most
of
jane
s
letters
for
the
last
few
years
before
leaving
steventon
show
some
of
the
decadence
due
to
trivial
surroundings
and
her
remarks
are
apt
to
be
spiced
with
unkindness
evidently
her
james
s
wife
was
not
a
favourite
she
objected
to
her
husband
s
being
so
much
at
steventon
though
jane
notes
that
he
persevered
in
coming
in
spite
of
mary
s
but
jane
s
sharpness
is
also
extended
to
her
remarks
on
her
acquaintances
the
debaries
persist
in
being
afflicted
at
the
death
of
their
uncle
of
whom
they
now
say
they
saw
a
great
deal
in
poor
debaries
it
is
quite
possible
that
his
death
had
showed
them
how
much
they
had
cared
for
him
at
all
events
after
his
death
they
could
have
had
nothing
to
gain
by
any
display
of
affection
after
a
small
ball
jane
writes
there
were
very
few
beauties
and
such
as
there
were
were
not
very
handsome
miss
iremonger
did
not
look
well
and
blount
was
the
only
one
much
admired
she
appeared
exactly
as
she
did
in
september
with
the
same
broad
face
diamond
bandeau
white
shoes
pink
husband
and
fat
neck
the
two
miss
coxes
were
there
i
traced
in
one
the
remains
of
the
vulgar
girl
who
danced
at
enham
eight
years
ago
the
other
is
refined
into
a
nice
girl
like
catherine
bigg
i
looked
at
sir
thomas
champneys
and
thought
of
poor
rosalie
i
looked
at
his
daughter
and
thought
her
a
queer
animal
with
a
white
and
later
she
adds
i
had
the
comfort
of
finding
out
the
other
evening
who
all
the
fat
girls
with
long
noses
were
that
disturbed
me
at
the
it
is
obvious
that
a
wider
horizon
would
do
the
writer
of
these
remarks
no
harm
the
income
which
the
family
would
have
is
indicated
in
the
following
remark
of
jane
s
made
about
this
time
my
father
is
doing
all
in
his
power
to
increase
his
income
by
raising
his
tithes
and
i
do
not
despair
of
getting
very
nearly
six
hundred
a
once
the
great
fact
of
the
removal
was
settled
there
remained
the
minor
difficulty
as
to
which
part
of
bath
would
be
the
best
to
live
in
of
this
jane
writes
there
are
three
parts
of
bath
which
we
have
thought
of
as
likely
to
have
houses
in
buildings
charles
street
and
some
of
the
short
streets
leading
from
laura
place
or
pulteney
street
westgate
buildings
though
quite
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
are
not
badly
situated
themselves
the
street
is
broad
and
has
rather
a
good
appearance
charles
street
however
i
think
is
preferable
the
buildings
are
new
and
its
nearness
to
kingsmead
fields
would
be
a
pleasant
circumstance
perhaps
you
may
remember
or
perhaps
you
may
forget
that
charles
street
leads
from
the
queen
s
square
chapel
to
the
two
green
park
streets
the
houses
in
the
streets
near
laura
place
i
should
expect
to
be
above
our
price
gay
street
would
be
too
high
except
only
the
lower
house
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
descend
towards
that
my
mother
has
no
disinclination
it
used
to
be
lower
rented
than
any
other
house
in
the
row
from
some
inferiority
in
the
apartments
but
above
all
others
her
wishes
are
at
present
fixed
on
the
corner
house
in
chapel
row
which
opens
into
prince
street
her
knowledge
of
it
however
is
confined
only
to
the
outside
and
therefore
she
is
equally
uncertain
of
its
being
really
desirable
as
of
its
being
to
be
had
in
the
meantime
she
assures
you
that
she
will
do
everything
in
her
power
to
avoid
trim
street
although
you
have
not
expressed
the
fearful
presentiment
of
it
which
was
rather
expected
we
know
that
perrot
will
want
to
get
us
into
oxford
buildings
but
we
all
unite
in
particular
dislike
of
that
part
of
the
town
and
therefore
hope
to
this
was
from
steventon
in
january
the
perrot
is
the
aunt
before
mentioned
she
was
to
austen
and
her
husband
had
taken
the
additional
name
of
perrot
it
was
from
him
that
inherited
the
additional
name
of
leigh
when
he
came
into
the
estate
the
austen
family
seem
to
have
been
almost
as
much
in
the
habit
of
changing
their
names
as
of
marrying
twice
the
topography
of
the
letter
can
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
know
bath
and
requires
little
comment
the
various
streets
mentioned
are
still
existing
and
we
can
pass
through
the
despised
trim
street
survey
the
house
in
gay
street
lower
rented
than
the
others
or
cross
over
the
river
to
laura
place
to
see
the
neighbourhood
jane
feared
would
be
too
expensive
just
as
well
now
as
she
could
then
in
may
of
jane
with
her
father
and
mother
went
to
bath
and
stayed
with
and
at
paragon
in
order
to
hunt
for
a
house
paragon
remains
unchanged
the
doorways
enclosed
by
and
pilasters
remain
the
very
type
of
late
architecture
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
difficulties
that
had
to
be
encountered
by
the
austens
in
their
quest
in
our
morning
s
circuit
we
looked
at
two
houses
in
green
park
buildings
one
of
which
pleased
me
very
well
we
walked
all
over
it
except
into
the
garret
the
is
of
a
comfortable
size
just
as
large
as
you
like
to
fancy
it
the
second
room
about
fourteen
feet
square
the
apartment
over
the
pleased
me
particularly
because
it
is
divided
into
two
the
smaller
one
a
very
nice
sized
which
upon
occasion
might
admit
a
bed
the
aspect
is
the
only
doubt
is
about
the
dampness
of
the
offices
of
which
there
were
yesterday
morning
we
looked
into
a
house
in
seymour
street
which
there
is
reason
to
suppose
will
soon
be
empty
as
we
are
assured
from
many
quarters
that
no
inconvenience
from
the
river
is
felt
in
those
buildings
we
are
at
liberty
to
fix
on
them
if
we
can
but
this
house
was
not
inviting
the
largest
room
downstairs
was
not
much
more
than
fourteen
feet
square
with
a
western
i
went
with
my
mother
to
look
at
some
houses
in
new
king
street
towards
which
she
felt
some
kind
of
inclination
but
their
size
has
now
satisfied
her
they
were
smaller
than
i
expected
to
find
them
one
in
particular
out
of
the
two
was
quite
monstrously
little
the
best
of
the
not
as
large
as
the
little
parlour
at
steventon
and
the
second
room
in
every
floor
about
capacious
enough
to
admit
a
very
small
single
our
views
on
buildings
seem
all
at
an
end
the
observation
of
the
damp
still
remaining
in
the
offices
of
a
house
which
has
only
been
vacated
a
week
with
reports
of
discontented
families
and
putrid
fevers
has
given
the
we
have
now
nothing
in
anyone
who
has
ever
been
will
sympathise
with
the
difficulties
sketched
in
these
remarks
it
was
finally
decided
that
the
family
should
go
to
sydney
place
and
later
they
removed
to
the
despised
green
park
buildings
after
all
the
sale
of
the
effects
at
steventon
had
begun
before
the
family
left
and
continued
after
my
father
and
mother
wisely
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
in
all
bath
such
a
bed
as
their
own
have
resolved
on
taking
it
with
them
all
the
beds
indeed
that
we
shall
want
are
to
be
removed
i
do
not
think
it
will
be
worth
while
to
remove
any
of
our
chests
of
drawers
we
shall
be
able
to
get
some
of
a
much
more
commodious
sort
made
of
deal
and
painted
to
look
very
neat
we
have
thought
at
times
of
removing
the
sideboard
or
a
pembroke
table
or
some
other
piece
of
furniture
but
on
the
whole
it
has
ended
in
thinking
that
the
trouble
and
risk
of
the
removal
would
be
more
than
the
advantage
of
having
them
at
a
place
where
everything
may
be
in
another
letter
she
imagines
that
the
appraisement
of
the
furniture
for
sale
will
amount
to
about
two
hundred
pounds
and
when
actually
at
bath
she
sends
the
following
details
guineas
and
a
half
for
the
three
cows
gives
one
some
support
under
the
blow
of
only
eleven
guineas
for
the
tables
eight
for
my
pianoforte
is
about
what
i
really
expected
to
mr
bent
seems
bent
upon
being
very
detestable
for
he
values
the
books
at
only
seventy
pounds
ten
shillings
for
dodsley
s
poems
however
please
me
to
the
quick
and
i
do
not
care
how
often
i
sell
them
again
for
as
sydney
place
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
overlooking
sydney
gardens
which
had
been
opened
for
public
entertainment
in
the
following
description
of
the
gardens
is
given
in
a
guide
contemporary
with
jane
s
residence
in
bath
the
kennet
and
avon
canal
runs
through
the
garden
with
two
elegant
bridges
thrown
over
it
after
the
manner
of
the
chinese
there
are
swings
bowling
greens
and
a
merlin
s
swing
in
the
labyrinth
during
the
summer
are
public
nights
with
music
fireworks
and
superb
before
jane
herself
lived
here
while
she
was
staying
in
queen
square
with
her
brother
and
his
family
she
had
been
to
a
grand
gala
in
sydney
gardens
with
illuminations
and
fireworks
which
surpassed
her
expectations
it
was
a
pleasant
part
of
bath
and
probably
the
austens
were
comfortable
enough
here
the
house
is
still
standing
it
is
one
of
a
solid
uniform
row
facing
nearly
due
east
and
bears
a
plate
stating
here
lived
jane
austen
from
an
inscription
not
quite
accurate
as
the
austens
left
in
it
is
one
great
charm
of
bath
that
electric
trams
and
modern
buildings
notwithstanding
the
place
is
so
very
much
the
same
as
it
was
when
jane
knew
it
the
narrow
intricate
streets
the
little
courts
and
passages
and
jutting
houses
are
everywhere
to
be
seen
the
town
is
essentially
late
eighteenth
century
and
the
modern
buildings
are
mere
additions
that
do
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
its
character
the
beautiful
abbey
had
in
her
time
been
more
or
less
repaired
and
the
choir
was
used
as
a
parish
church
but
the
pinnacles
were
added
to
the
spire
only
in
and
the
complete
restoration
took
place
in
the
pump
room
near
at
hand
was
built
in
replacing
one
which
had
existed
for
years
if
we
except
a
few
trifles
such
as
electric
pendants
to
the
great
central
chandelier
we
see
it
as
it
was
in
jane
s
day
the
fluted
pilasters
running
up
to
the
ceiling
are
very
characteristic
of
the
florid
georgian
taste
in
a
print
of
the
interior
of
the
pump
room
dated
we
see
all
the
women
even
the
attendants
with
bare
arms
and
necks
quite
uncovered
fashion
revived
in
some
of
the
women
wear
a
kind
of
modified
with
coquelicot
plumes
in
the
alcove
at
the
end
is
a
statue
of
fat
little
beau
nash
who
was
the
regenerator
and
in
some
sense
the
maker
of
bath
but
nash
s
name
is
associated
even
more
with
the
assembly
rooms
than
the
pump
room
the
assembly
rooms
are
some
distance
from
the
pump
rooms
and
the
baths
being
situated
not
far
from
the
famous
crescent
in
jane
s
time
there
were
two
sets
of
assembly
rooms
upper
and
lower
governed
by
two
different
masters
of
the
ceremonies
positions
which
were
much
coveted
in
the
lower
rooms
were
burnt
down
and
not
rebuilt
but
the
upper
are
still
used
and
the
names
over
the
doors
of
the
rooms
recall
many
a
scene
in
jane
austen
s
novels
bath
really
began
to
be
fashionable
in
the
early
part
of
queen
anne
s
reign
but
it
was
nash
who
consolidated
its
attractions
and
brought
it
up
to
its
highest
pitch
of
popularity
illustration
façade
of
the
pump
room
bath
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
he
went
there
the
amusements
of
the
place
were
neither
elegant
nor
conducted
with
delicacy
general
society
among
people
of
rank
or
fortune
was
by
no
means
established
the
nobility
still
preserved
a
tincture
of
gothic
haughtiness
and
refused
to
keep
company
with
the
gentry
at
any
of
the
public
entertainments
of
the
place
smoking
in
the
rooms
was
permitted
gentlemen
and
ladies
appeared
in
a
disrespectful
manner
at
public
entertainments
in
aprons
and
boots
with
an
eagerness
common
to
those
whose
pleasures
come
but
seldom
they
generally
continued
them
too
long
and
thus
they
were
rendered
disgusting
by
too
free
an
enjoyment
if
the
company
liked
each
other
they
danced
till
morning
if
any
person
lost
at
cards
he
insisted
on
continuing
the
game
till
luck
should
turn
the
lodgings
for
visitants
were
paltry
though
expensive
the
and
other
chambers
were
floored
with
boards
coloured
brown
with
soot
and
small
beer
to
hide
the
dirt
the
walls
were
covered
with
unpainted
wainscot
the
furniture
corresponded
with
the
meanness
of
the
architecture
a
few
oak
chairs
a
small
with
a
fender
and
tongs
composed
the
magnificence
of
these
temporary
habitations
the
city
was
in
itself
mean
and
contemptible
no
elegant
buildings
no
open
streets
no
uniform
thither
nash
came
in
he
was
the
man
of
all
others
to
organise
fashionable
entertainments
under
his
severe
yet
fatherly
rule
the
place
sprang
quickly
into
popularity
houses
were
built
streets
repaved
balls
and
entertainments
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
an
assembly
room
was
built
and
good
music
engaged
but
it
was
not
until
eight
years
after
nash
s
death
that
the
present
building
was
erected
nash
s
code
of
rules
continued
in
force
for
long
after
his
death
before
which
he
had
sunk
from
the
position
of
esteem
which
he
had
once
enjoyed
his
rules
throw
some
light
on
the
conduct
of
these
delightful
assemblies
and
are
worth
that
a
visit
of
ceremony
at
first
coming
and
another
at
going
away
are
all
that
are
expected
or
desired
by
ladies
of
quality
and
impertinents
that
ladies
coming
to
the
ball
appoint
a
time
for
their
footmen
coming
to
wait
on
them
home
to
prevent
disturbance
and
inconvenience
to
themselves
and
others
that
gentlemen
of
fashion
never
appearing
in
a
morning
before
the
ladies
in
gowns
and
caps
show
breeding
and
respect
that
no
person
take
it
ill
that
anyone
goes
to
another
s
play
or
breakfast
and
not
theirs
except
captious
by
nature
that
no
gentleman
give
his
ticket
for
the
balls
to
any
but
gentlewomen
he
has
none
of
his
acquaintance
that
gentlemen
crowding
before
the
ladies
at
the
ball
show
ill
manners
and
that
none
do
so
for
the
future
except
such
as
respect
nobody
but
themselves
that
no
gentleman
or
lady
takes
it
ill
that
another
dances
before
them
except
such
as
have
no
pretence
to
dance
at
all
that
the
elder
ladies
and
children
be
content
with
a
second
bench
at
a
ball
as
being
past
or
not
come
to
perfection
that
the
younger
ladies
take
notice
how
many
eyes
observe
them
that
all
whisperers
of
lies
or
scandal
be
taken
for
their
authors
that
all
repeaters
of
such
lies
and
scandal
be
shunned
by
the
company
except
such
as
have
been
guilty
of
the
same
crime
nash
s
rigour
in
regard
to
appearances
in
the
case
of
is
elsewhere
mentioned
he
disliked
quite
as
much
the
aprons
which
smart
ladies
then
wore
on
many
occasions
and
when
the
duchess
of
queensberry
entered
one
evening
in
one
of
these
he
snatched
it
off
and
flung
it
over
the
back
benches
among
the
ladies
maids
the
rules
for
balls
were
probably
very
much
the
same
when
jane
austen
attended
them
as
when
nash
was
living
everything
was
to
be
performed
in
proper
order
each
ball
was
to
open
with
a
minuet
danced
by
two
persons
of
the
highest
distinction
present
when
the
minuet
concluded
the
lady
was
to
return
to
her
seat
and
nash
was
to
bring
the
gentleman
a
new
partner
the
minuets
generally
continued
two
hours
at
eight
the
country
dances
began
ladies
of
quality
according
to
their
rank
standing
up
first
about
nine
o
clock
a
short
interval
was
allowed
for
rest
and
for
the
gentlemen
to
help
their
partners
to
tea
the
ball
having
begun
it
must
be
remembered
about
six
the
company
pursued
their
amusements
until
the
clock
struck
eleven
when
the
music
ceased
instantly
and
nash
never
allowed
this
rule
to
be
broken
even
when
the
princess
amelia
herself
pleaded
for
one
dance
more
among
other
rules
was
one
mentioned
by
that
ladies
who
intended
to
dance
minuets
were
requested
to
wear
lappets
to
distinguish
them
also
in
order
that
every
lady
may
have
an
opportunity
of
dancing
gentlemen
should
change
their
partners
every
two
dances
we
see
in
this
last
rule
how
the
transition
from
one
partner
for
the
whole
evening
to
the
continual
change
of
partners
came
to
pass
after
returning
from
lyme
regis
in
the
autumn
of
the
austens
left
sydney
place
and
went
to
green
park
buildings
which
had
been
among
the
houses
first
considered
they
were
here
when
austen
s
death
occurred
in
january
and
then
austen
and
her
daughters
moved
into
lodgings
in
gay
street
lybbe
powys
gives
us
a
lively
of
bath
in
the
dress
ball
upper
rooms
immensely
crowded
at
ten
but
the
number
of
card
parties
quite
spoilt
the
balls
as
tis
fashionable
to
attend
five
or
six
before
you
go
to
the
room
it
was
endeavoured
to
alter
these
hours
but
fortunately
for
the
old
people
and
those
who
drink
the
waters
it
was
not
permitted
and
at
eleven
if
in
the
middle
of
a
dance
the
music
stops
but
i
suppose
tis
reckoned
vulgar
to
come
early
one
sees
nothing
of
the
dancing
or
company
for
the
crowds
the
rooms
are
not
half
so
agreeable
as
they
were
some
years
ago
when
the
late
london
hours
were
not
thought
of
and
how
prejudicial
must
they
be
to
the
health
of
all
is
very
visible
in
the
young
as
in
the
old
sixteen
thousand
strangers
at
bath
in
the
season
of
bath
itself
we
hear
in
the
satirical
skit
called
new
of
all
the
gay
places
the
world
can
afford
by
gentle
and
simple
for
pastime
adored
fine
balls
and
fine
concerts
fine
buildings
and
springs
fine
walks
and
fine
views
and
a
thousand
fine
things
not
to
mention
the
sweet
situation
and
air
what
place
my
dear
mother
with
bath
can
compare
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
jane
would
thoroughly
enjoy
the
change
afforded
by
such
constant
opportunity
for
diversion
such
delightful
mingling
with
a
crowd
in
which
her
bright
humour
must
have
found
frequent
opportunities
for
indulgence
as
we
have
seen
she
had
written
her
first
bath
book
many
years
before
and
while
she
sat
in
the
pump
room
awaited
a
partner
in
the
assembly
rooms
or
shopped
in
milsom
street
she
must
have
recalled
her
own
creations
catherine
morland
and
isabella
thorpe
henry
tilney
and
allen
quite
as
vividly
as
if
they
were
real
persons
of
her
acquaintance
the
second
bath
book
was
not
written
until
many
years
after
yet
these
two
chronologically
so
far
apart
topographically
so
near
each
other
have
always
been
owing
to
conditions
of
length
bound
together
this
is
jane
s
own
account
of
her
first
ball
after
coming
to
live
at
bath
i
dressed
myself
as
well
as
i
could
and
had
all
my
finery
much
admired
at
home
by
nine
o
clock
my
uncle
aunt
and
i
entered
the
rooms
and
linked
miss
winstone
on
to
us
before
tea
it
was
rather
a
dull
affair
but
then
tea
did
not
last
long
for
there
was
only
one
dance
danced
by
four
couple
think
of
four
couple
surrounded
by
about
an
hundred
people
dancing
in
the
upper
rooms
at
bath
after
tea
we
cheered
up
the
breaking
up
of
private
parties
sent
some
scores
more
to
the
ball
and
though
it
was
shockingly
and
inhumanly
thin
for
this
place
there
were
people
enough
i
suppose
to
have
made
five
or
six
very
pretty
basingstoke
it
is
interesting
to
compare
this
with
her
account
of
her
heroine
catherine
morland
s
first
appearance
mrs
allen
was
so
long
in
dressing
that
they
did
not
enter
the
till
late
the
season
was
full
the
room
crowded
and
the
two
ladies
squeezed
in
as
well
as
they
could
as
for
allen
he
repaired
directly
to
the
and
left
them
to
enjoy
a
mob
by
themselves
with
more
care
for
the
safety
of
her
new
gown
than
for
the
comfort
of
her
protegée
allen
made
her
way
through
the
throng
of
men
by
the
door
as
swiftly
as
the
necessary
caution
would
allow
catherine
however
kept
close
at
her
side
and
linked
her
arm
too
firmly
within
her
friend
s
to
be
torn
asunder
by
any
common
effort
of
a
struggling
assembly
but
to
her
utter
amazement
she
found
that
to
proceed
along
the
room
was
by
no
means
the
way
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
crowd
it
seemed
rather
to
increase
as
they
went
on
whereas
she
had
imagined
that
when
once
fairly
within
the
door
they
should
easily
find
seats
and
be
able
to
watch
the
dances
with
perfect
convenience
but
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
and
though
by
unwearied
diligence
they
gained
even
the
top
of
the
room
their
situation
was
just
the
same
they
saw
nothing
of
the
dancers
but
the
high
feathers
of
some
of
the
ladies
still
they
moved
on
something
better
was
yet
in
view
and
by
a
continued
exertion
of
strength
and
ingenuity
they
found
themselves
at
last
in
the
passage
behind
the
highest
bench
here
there
was
something
less
of
crowd
than
below
and
hence
miss
morland
had
a
comprehensive
view
of
all
the
company
beneath
her
and
of
all
the
dangers
of
her
late
passage
through
them
it
was
a
splendid
sight
and
she
began
for
the
first
time
that
evening
to
feel
herself
at
a
ball
she
longed
to
dance
but
she
had
not
an
acquaintance
in
the
room
everybody
was
shortly
in
motion
for
tea
and
they
must
squeeze
out
like
the
rest
and
when
they
at
last
arrived
in
the
they
were
obliged
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
a
table
at
which
a
large
party
were
already
placed
without
having
anything
to
do
there
or
anybody
to
speak
to
except
each
other
after
some
time
they
received
an
offer
of
tea
from
one
of
their
neighbours
it
was
thankfully
accepted
and
this
introduced
a
light
conversation
with
the
gentleman
who
offered
it
which
was
the
only
time
that
anybody
spoke
to
them
during
the
evening
till
they
were
discovered
and
joined
by
allen
when
the
dance
was
over
well
miss
morland
said
he
directly
i
hope
you
have
had
an
agreeable
very
agreeable
indeed
she
replied
vainly
endeavouring
to
hide
a
great
but
poor
catherine
was
much
more
fortunate
in
her
second
essay
being
introduced
to
henry
tilney
the
hero
who
captivated
her
girlish
admiration
and
who
at
last
struck
by
her
and
earnest
affection
for
himself
fell
in
love
with
her
and
made
her
his
wife
in
jane
places
the
thorpes
in
edgar
buildings
which
she
always
spells
edgar
s
the
tilneys
in
milsom
street
and
catherine
morland
with
the
allens
in
pulteney
street
her
topography
is
always
very
exact
and
unimpeachable
milsom
street
also
plays
a
large
part
in
it
is
here
that
anne
comes
across
admiral
croft
looking
into
a
print
shop
window
from
whence
he
accompanies
her
back
to
camden
place
where
her
father
and
sister
are
and
in
the
course
of
the
walk
anne
learns
to
her
infinite
relief
that
louisa
musgrove
is
engaged
to
captain
benwick
so
that
the
terrible
thought
that
she
might
hear
any
day
of
her
engagement
to
captain
wentworth
is
dispelled
for
ever
in
milsom
street
also
while
sheltering
in
a
shop
from
the
rain
she
first
sees
captain
wentworth
after
his
arrival
in
bath
and
on
his
coming
accidentally
into
the
same
shop
with
some
friends
both
he
and
she
are
unable
to
hide
their
signs
of
perturbation
but
it
is
at
a
concert
in
the
upper
rooms
that
anne
goes
through
far
worse
disquietude
while
with
the
tormenting
uncertainty
of
an
undeclared
love
she
sits
wondering
whether
he
will
come
to
speak
to
her
or
not
it
is
at
the
white
hart
inn
which
overlooked
the
entrance
to
the
pump
room
arcade
that
the
real
crisis
of
the
book
takes
place
here
anne
on
coming
to
spend
the
day
with
her
sister
mary
charles
musgrove
who
is
staying
there
with
her
husband
finds
captain
harville
and
captain
wentworth
it
is
her
conversation
with
the
former
that
reveals
to
the
latter
her
own
unchanged
feelings
and
gives
him
the
courage
to
write
her
a
letter
declaring
once
more
his
own
love
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
anne
is
thereby
rewarded
for
her
gentle
loyalty
and
when
in
going
up
union
street
with
her
she
is
overtaken
by
captain
wentworth
and
handed
over
to
his
charge
mutual
explanations
are
made
and
mutual
happiness
reached
certainly
to
the
lovers
of
jane
austen
s
books
these
characters
people
the
streets
quite
as
vividly
as
any
persons
who
have
ever
lived
in
them
chapter
xiii
dress
and
fashions
jane
austen
had
a
lively
and
natural
interest
in
dress
and
her
letters
abound
in
allusions
to
fashions
new
clothes
and
contrivances
for
bringing
into
the
mode
those
that
had
fallen
behind
it
she
can
not
have
had
much
chance
of
seeing
new
fashions
at
steventon
but
when
she
went
to
a
town
her
instincts
revived
during
her
visit
to
bath
when
she
was
staying
with
her
brother
edward
and
his
wife
elizabeth
and
some
of
their
children
she
my
cloak
is
come
home
i
like
it
very
much
and
can
now
exclaim
with
delight
like
j
bond
at
hay
harvest
this
is
what
i
have
been
looking
for
these
three
i
saw
some
gauzes
in
a
shop
in
bath
street
yesterday
at
only
fourpence
a
yard
but
they
were
not
so
good
or
so
pretty
as
mine
flowers
are
very
much
worn
and
fruit
is
still
more
the
thing
elizabeth
has
a
bunch
of
strawberries
and
i
have
seen
grapes
cherries
plums
and
apricots
there
are
likewise
almonds
and
raisins
french
plums
and
tamarinds
at
the
grocers
but
i
have
never
seen
any
of
them
in
hats
a
plum
or
greengage
would
cost
three
shillings
cherries
and
grapes
about
five
i
believe
but
this
is
at
some
of
the
dearest
the
fashion
to
which
she
refers
was
soon
carried
to
excess
hannah
more
in
her
diary
says
that
she
met
women
who
had
on
their
heads
an
acre
and
a
half
of
shrubbery
besides
slopes
tulip
beds
clumps
of
peonies
and
and
she
had
no
doubt
that
they
held
in
great
contempt
our
roseless
heads
and
leafless
some
ladies
carry
on
their
heads
a
large
quantity
of
fruit
and
yet
they
would
despise
a
poor
useful
member
of
society
who
carried
it
there
for
the
purpose
of
selling
it
for
this
fashion
continued
to
increase
until
it
was
mimicked
by
garrick
who
appeared
on
the
stage
with
a
mass
of
vegetables
on
his
head
and
a
large
carrot
hanging
from
each
side
and
ridicule
killed
the
folly
it
seems
quite
certain
that
fashion
which
never
reached
such
grotesque
monstrosities
as
in
the
lifetime
of
jane
austen
hardly
touched
in
its
extremer
modes
herself
and
her
sister
who
kept
to
the
simpler
styles
with
good
taste
in
fact
the
jest
about
the
grocers
shows
that
jane
herself
saw
the
humour
of
the
thing
even
when
living
in
the
very
midst
of
it
a
most
unusual
acuteness
she
describes
her
own
hat
in
the
same
letter
as
being
a
pretty
hat
pretty
style
of
hat
too
it
is
something
like
eliza
s
only
instead
of
being
all
straw
half
of
it
is
narrow
purple
ribbon
which
seems
simple
enough
illustration
dressing
to
go
out
what
one
would
like
to
get
is
some
mental
picture
of
jane
as
she
appeared
indoors
and
out
of
doors
and
this
is
extremely
difficult
in
the
illustration
dressing
to
go
out
by
tomkins
we
get
some
idea
of
everyday
fashions
the
simple
style
of
a
plain
material
with
perhaps
a
little
spot
or
sprig
upon
it
of
soft
muslin
made
with
a
flowing
skirt
and
a
chemisette
folded
in
and
with
sleeves
reaching
only
to
the
elbow
was
doubtless
the
most
ordinary
kind
of
indoor
dress
for
women
add
to
this
a
cap
and
this
is
as
near
as
we
can
get
to
jane
s
usual
appearance
the
caps
however
varied
greatly
being
worn
both
indoors
and
also
for
driving
mr
remarks
that
jane
and
her
sister
took
to
wearing
caps
earlier
in
life
than
was
generally
the
custom
but
on
the
contrary
caps
were
worn
by
very
young
girls
at
this
period
for
papendick
says
in
her
journal
which
is
contemporary
that
no
young
girl
of
eighteen
was
seen
in
public
without
some
of
this
description
we
learn
many
particulars
of
the
different
kinds
of
cap
worn
by
jane
from
her
own
letters
i
have
made
myself
two
or
three
caps
to
wear
of
evenings
since
i
came
home
and
they
save
me
a
world
of
torment
as
to
hairdressing
which
at
present
gives
me
no
trouble
beyond
washing
and
brushing
for
my
long
hair
is
always
plaited
up
out
of
sight
and
my
short
hair
curls
well
enough
to
want
no
i
took
the
liberty
a
few
days
ago
of
asking
your
black
velvet
bonnet
to
lend
me
its
caul
which
it
readily
did
and
by
which
i
have
been
enabled
to
give
a
considerable
improvement
of
dignity
to
the
cap
which
was
before
too
to
please
me
i
still
venture
to
retain
the
narrow
silver
round
it
put
twice
round
without
any
bow
and
instead
of
the
black
military
feather
shall
put
in
the
coquelicot
one
as
being
smarter
and
besides
coquelicot
is
to
be
all
the
fashion
this
winter
after
the
ball
i
shall
probably
make
it
entirely
i
am
not
to
wear
my
white
satin
cap
after
all
i
am
to
wear
a
mamalouc
cap
instead
which
charles
fowle
sent
to
mary
and
which
she
lends
me
it
is
all
the
fashion
now
worn
at
the
opera
and
by
lady
mildmay
at
hackwood
the
word
mamalouc
was
used
at
this
time
to
describe
many
articles
of
dress
it
had
come
into
fashion
after
nelson
s
great
victory
in
egypt
and
there
were
mamalouc
cloaks
as
well
as
caps
but
whether
these
articles
of
attire
bore
the
most
distant
resemblance
to
those
worn
in
egypt
or
whether
the
word
was
tacked
on
to
them
merely
for
the
purpose
of
advertisement
i
do
not
know
another
cap
jane
mentions
seems
to
have
been
much
more
pert
miss
hare
had
some
pretty
caps
and
is
to
make
me
one
like
one
of
them
only
white
satin
instead
of
blue
it
will
be
satin
and
lace
and
a
little
white
flower
perking
out
of
the
left
ear
like
harriot
byron
s
feather
i
have
allowed
her
to
go
as
far
as
one
pound
my
cap
has
come
home
and
i
like
it
very
much
fanny
has
one
also
hers
is
white
sarsenet
and
lace
of
a
different
shape
from
mine
more
fit
for
morning
carriage
wear
which
is
what
it
is
intended
for
and
is
in
shape
exceedingly
like
our
own
satin
and
lace
of
last
winter
shaped
round
the
face
exactly
like
it
with
pipes
and
more
fulness
and
a
round
crown
inserted
behind
my
cap
has
a
peak
in
front
large
full
bows
of
very
narrow
ribbon
old
twopenny
are
the
thing
one
over
the
right
temple
perhaps
and
another
at
the
left
some
ladies
used
to
hang
at
the
back
of
their
caps
four
or
five
ostrich
feathers
of
different
colours
but
apparently
a
bow
or
a
bit
of
ribbon
sometimes
was
worn
instead
of
a
cap
and
supposed
to
represent
it
just
as
a
bit
of
wire
and
gauze
a
few
years
ago
was
supposed
to
be
a
toque
in
one
place
jane
i
wore
at
the
ball
your
favourite
gown
a
bit
of
muslin
of
the
same
round
my
head
bordered
with
cooper
s
band
and
one
little
the
fashion
of
caps
for
ladies
has
so
recently
gone
out
that
it
is
well
remembered
but
the
fashion
of
which
belongs
to
a
much
older
generation
seems
to
us
now
curious
they
were
then
an
essential
part
of
a
wardrobe
henry
bickersteth
afterwards
lord
langdale
writes
to
his
mother
in
i
must
give
you
my
thanks
for
the
supply
of
linen
you
have
sent
me
it
was
indeed
seasonable
as
that
which
i
had
before
was
completely
worn
out
i
am
still
obliged
to
solicit
some
he
was
then
only
a
boy
of
sixteen
and
the
vision
of
all
the
boys
in
a
school
going
to
bed
in
is
a
funny
one
reached
their
climax
of
absurdity
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
the
styles
varied
so
much
that
almost
everyone
could
please
themselves
at
a
famous
trial
only
a
few
ladies
were
dressed
in
the
french
taste
all
the
rest
decked
in
the
finest
manner
with
brocades
diamonds
and
lace
had
no
other
but
a
ribband
tied
to
their
hair
over
which
they
wore
a
flat
hat
adorned
with
a
variety
of
ornaments
it
requires
much
observation
to
be
able
to
give
full
account
of
the
great
effect
produced
by
this
hat
it
affords
the
ladies
who
wear
it
that
arch
and
roguish
air
which
the
winged
hat
gives
to
and
sir
walter
besant
says
the
women
wore
hoods
small
caps
enormous
hats
tiny
milkmaid
s
straw
hats
hair
in
curls
and
flat
to
the
head
pompoms
or
huge
structures
two
or
three
feet
high
with
all
kinds
of
birds
nests
ships
carriages
and
waggons
in
gold
and
silver
the
nothing
can
be
conceived
so
absurd
extravagant
fantastical
as
the
present
mode
of
dressing
the
head
simplicity
and
modesty
are
things
so
much
exploded
that
the
very
names
are
no
longer
remembered
i
have
just
escaped
from
one
of
the
most
fashionable
disfigurers
and
though
i
charged
him
to
dress
me
with
the
greatest
simplicity
and
to
have
only
a
very
distant
eye
upon
the
fashion
just
enough
to
avoid
the
pride
of
singularity
without
running
into
ridiculous
excess
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
sage
didactics
i
absolutely
blush
at
myself
and
turn
to
the
glass
with
as
much
caution
as
a
vain
beauty
just
risen
from
the
which
can
not
be
a
more
disfiguring
disease
than
the
present
mode
of
more
but
in
a
great
change
occurred
in
the
mode
of
the
huge
cushions
disappeared
and
the
main
part
of
the
hair
was
gathered
together
at
the
back
in
a
chignon
from
which
one
or
two
loose
curls
were
allowed
to
escape
the
long
feathers
which
have
already
been
commented
on
varied
in
number
from
three
to
one
and
continued
to
be
worn
well
on
into
the
nineteenth
century
these
feathers
appeared
in
turbans
bonnets
and
of
all
kinds
and
hardly
a
picture
of
the
period
representing
ladies
at
a
does
not
show
one
or
more
of
these
ludicrous
quivering
monstrosities
samuel
rogers
says
that
he
had
been
to
ranelagh
in
a
coach
with
a
lady
who
was
obliged
to
sit
on
a
stool
on
the
floor
of
the
coach
on
account
of
the
height
of
her
fantastic
headgear
was
not
in
jane
s
line
all
the
accounts
of
her
hats
and
bonnets
are
simple
my
mother
has
ordered
a
new
bonnet
and
so
have
i
both
white
strip
trimmed
with
white
ribbon
i
find
my
straw
bonnet
looking
very
much
like
other
people
s
and
quite
as
smart
bonnets
of
cambric
muslin
are
a
good
deal
worn
and
some
of
them
are
very
pretty
but
i
shall
defer
one
of
that
sort
until
your
in
the
last
ten
years
of
the
century
poke
bonnets
and
dunstable
hats
were
much
in
evidence
and
with
flowing
curls
and
flowing
ribbons
tied
in
a
large
bow
under
the
chin
were
sometimes
not
unbecoming
to
a
pretty
face
but
in
jane
s
lifetime
the
strangest
fashion
that
ever
caused
discomfort
to
a
whole
nation
gradually
died
down
that
is
to
say
the
use
of
wigs
yet
that
they
were
worn
so
late
as
is
shown
by
jane
s
remark
in
one
of
the
letters
my
brother
and
edward
his
son
arrived
last
night
their
business
is
about
teeth
and
nothing
quickened
the
departure
of
the
wig
so
much
as
the
tax
put
on
hair
powder
by
pitt
in
people
argued
that
they
did
not
mind
the
money
but
they
thought
it
so
iniquitous
to
tax
powder
that
they
left
off
wearing
powdered
wigs
to
spite
the
government
and
probably
once
having
discovered
the
comfort
of
doing
without
these
hideous
evils
they
would
never
return
to
them
yet
that
the
wig
even
in
its
heyday
was
not
universally
worn
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
king
george
iii
himself
refused
to
wear
one
the
king
s
hair
which
is
very
thick
and
of
the
finest
light
colour
tied
behind
with
a
ribband
and
dressed
by
the
hand
of
the
queen
is
one
of
his
most
striking
ornaments
notwithstanding
this
the
peruke
makers
have
presented
an
address
to
the
king
requesting
his
majesty
that
for
the
good
of
their
body
and
the
nation
he
would
be
pleased
to
wear
a
grosley
no
one
has
given
a
better
account
of
the
wig
than
sir
walter
besant
he
says
the
wig
was
a
great
leveller
with
the
wig
it
mattered
nothing
whether
one
was
bald
or
not
again
the
wig
was
a
great
protection
for
the
head
it
saved
the
wearer
from
the
effects
of
cold
draughts
it
was
part
of
the
comfort
of
the
age
like
the
sash
window
and
the
wainscoted
wall
and
the
wig
too
like
the
coat
and
the
waistcoat
was
a
means
of
showing
the
wealth
of
its
owner
because
a
wig
of
the
best
kind
new
properly
curled
and
combed
cost
a
large
sum
of
money
practically
it
was
indestructible
and
with
certain
alterations
descended
first
it
was
left
by
will
to
son
or
heir
next
it
was
given
to
the
coachman
then
with
alterations
to
the
gardener
then
it
went
to
the
people
in
monmouth
street
whence
it
continued
a
downward
course
until
it
finally
entered
upon
its
last
career
of
usefulness
in
the
shoeblack
s
box
there
was
lastly
an
excellent
reason
why
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
found
more
convenient
to
wear
a
wig
than
the
natural
hair
those
of
the
lower
classes
who
were
not
in
domestic
service
wore
their
own
hair
their
heads
were
filled
with
vermin
were
very
easily
the
man
who
shaved
his
head
and
wore
a
wig
was
free
of
this
in
the
eighteenth
we
know
that
johnson
s
wigs
were
a
constant
source
of
trouble
for
they
were
not
only
dirty
and
unkempt
but
generally
burnt
away
in
the
front
for
being
very
nearsighted
he
often
put
his
head
into
the
candle
when
poring
over
his
books
whenever
he
was
staying
with
the
thrales
therefore
the
butler
used
to
waylay
him
as
he
passed
in
to
dinner
and
pull
off
the
wig
on
his
head
replacing
it
with
a
new
one
ladies
rarely
appeared
without
of
some
kind
be
it
only
a
bow
or
an
ornamental
comb
they
seemed
to
think
that
a
woman
should
be
seen
with
her
head
covered
in
every
place
as
well
as
in
church
near
the
end
of
the
flighty
lady
honoria
cries
why
you
know
sir
as
to
caps
and
wigs
they
are
very
serious
things
for
we
should
look
mighty
droll
figures
to
go
about
bareheaded
which
shows
how
entirely
custom
dictates
what
appears
mighty
droll
or
quite
ordinary
wigs
were
sometimes
the
cause
of
ludicrous
incidents
as
when
in
the
house
of
commons
lord
north
suddenly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
out
bore
off
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
the
wig
of
welbore
ellis
who
happened
to
be
stooping
forward
many
people
when
wigs
began
to
go
out
of
fashion
powdered
their
own
hair
and
of
this
besant
gives
us
also
an
unpleasant
but
speaking
picture
among
the
minor
miseries
of
life
is
to
be
mentioned
the
slipping
and
sliding
of
lumps
of
the
powder
and
pomatum
from
the
head
down
to
the
plate
at
even
boys
at
school
wore
queues
of
a
master
at
eton
it
is
said
that
his
management
of
the
boys
excellent
in
other
respects
was
in
some
things
amiss
for
he
burnt
all
their
ruffles
and
cut
off
their
of
april
mentions
that
a
numerous
club
has
been
formed
in
lambeth
called
the
crop
club
every
member
of
which
on
his
entrance
is
obliged
to
have
his
head
docked
as
close
as
the
duke
of
bridgewater
s
old
bay
coach
horses
this
assemblage
is
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
or
rather
evading
the
tax
on
powdered
the
use
of
powder
is
mentioned
in
jane
austen
s
story
and
is
one
of
the
very
few
touches
she
gives
that
carry
us
backward
in
time
robert
watson
is
speaking
to
her
i
would
not
make
you
wait
said
she
so
i
put
on
the
first
thing
i
met
with
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
sad
figure
my
dear
addressing
her
husband
you
have
not
put
any
fresh
powder
in
your
no
i
do
not
intend
it
i
think
there
is
powder
enough
in
my
hair
for
my
wife
and
indeed
you
ought
to
make
some
alteration
in
your
dress
before
dinner
when
you
are
out
visiting
though
you
do
not
at
nonsense
dinner
came
and
except
when
robert
looked
at
her
husband
s
head
she
continued
gay
and
later
when
tom
musgrave
arrives
robert
watson
stealing
a
view
of
his
own
head
in
an
opposite
glass
said
with
equal
civility
you
can
not
be
more
in
deshabille
than
myself
we
got
here
so
late
that
i
had
not
time
even
to
put
a
little
fresh
powder
in
my
the
powders
used
were
very
various
and
now
we
are
upon
vanities
what
do
you
think
is
the
reigning
mode
as
to
powder
only
tumerick
that
coarse
dye
that
stains
yellow
it
falls
out
of
the
hair
and
stains
the
skin
so
that
every
pretty
lady
must
look
as
yellow
as
a
crocus
which
i
suppose
will
come
a
better
compliment
than
as
white
as
a
mrs
papendick
flour
was
frequently
used
for
powdering
heads
and
in
flour
was
very
scarce
and
enormously
valuable
in
the
same
year
when
the
powder
tax
was
passed
the
privy
council
implored
all
families
to
abjure
puddings
and
pies
and
declared
their
own
intention
to
have
only
fish
meat
vegetables
and
household
bread
made
partly
of
rye
it
was
recommended
that
one
quartern
loaf
per
head
per
week
should
be
a
maximum
allowance
the
loaf
was
to
be
brought
on
the
table
for
each
to
help
himself
that
none
be
wasted
the
king
himself
had
none
but
household
bread
on
his
table
in
the
government
offered
bounties
on
the
importation
of
all
kinds
of
grain
and
flour
and
passed
the
brown
bread
act
forbidding
the
sale
of
wheaten
bread
or
new
bread
of
any
kind
as
stale
bread
would
go
further
mary
bateson
in
this
scarcity
and
dearness
of
bread
is
a
thing
never
felt
in
the
present
day
when
lumps
of
the
best
white
bread
are
flung
in
heaps
in
the
squares
and
streets
of
london
and
disdained
even
by
tramps
and
beggars
and
when
boys
in
the
north
country
go
round
with
sacks
begging
bits
of
bread
which
they
afterwards
use
for
feeding
ponies
or
horses
many
epigrams
and
were
made
on
the
new
powder
tax
a
tax
on

had
at
that
time
been

expected

should

excuses
them
and
falls
on
of
the
inconveniences
attending
the
use
of
powder
the
following
anecdote
is
an
at
one
of
lady
crewe
s
dinner
parties
grattan
after
talking
very
delightfully
for
some
time
all
at
once
seemed
disconcerted
and
sunk
into
silence
i
asked
his
daughter
who
was
sitting
next
to
me
the
reason
of
this
oh
she
replied
he
has
just
found
out
that
he
has
come
here
in
his
powdering
samuel
rogers
the
act
claimed
one
guinea
a
year
from
every
user
of
powder
and
was
calculated
to
bring
in
about
per
annum
the
royal
family
clergymen
whose
incomes
were
under
a
hundred
pounds
subalterns
and
all
below
that
rank
in
the
army
officers
in
the
navy
under
the
rank
of
commander
and
all
below
the
two
eldest
unmarried
daughters
of
a
family
were
exempt
walter
savage
landor
was
the
first
of
undergraduates
at
oxford
to
do
without
powder
and
was
told
he
would
be
stoned
for
a
republican
the
regular
academic
costume
so
late
as
consisted
of
knee
breeches
of
any
colour
and
white
stockings
the
sun
of
wigs
had
not
even
then
set
they
covered
the
craniums
of
nearly
all
dons
and
heads
of
houses
the
gentlemen
wore
their
hair
tied
up
behind
in
a
thin
loop
called
a
pigtail
footmen
wore
their
hair
tied
up
behind
in
a
thick
loop
called
a
sydney
and
the
in
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
costume
of
ladies
the
most
noticeable
points
of
the
mode
were
the
high
waists
and
long
flowing
skirts
clinging
tightly
to
the
figure
this
if
not
carried
to
excess
was
certainly
becoming
but
fashion
can
not
be
content
with
mediocrity
it
must
be
extravagant
consequently
with
very
low
bodices
and
very
high
waists
came
very
scanty
clothing
with
an
absence
of
petticoat
a
fashion
which
left
very
little
of
the
form
to
the
imagination
i
do
not
say
that
our
english
belles
went
to
the
extent
of
some
of
their
french
sisters
of
having
their
muslin
dresses
put
on
holding
them
tight
to
their
figures
till
they
as
absolutely
to
mould
them
to
their
form
but
their
clothes
were
of
the
scantiest
and
as
year
succeeded
year
this
fashion
developed
if
one
can
call
diminution
of
clothing
john
ashton
it
is
difficult
to
give
any
consecutive
account
of
fashions
extending
over
such
a
long
period
for
they
varied
as
frequently
then
as
they
do
now
however
here
are
a
few
notes
coquelicot
that
is
poppy
colour
was
very
fashionable
jane
as
we
have
seen
adopted
it
at
one
time
no
lady
s
dress
was
considered
complete
without
a
dash
of
coquelicot
in
sash
or
trimmings
jane
frequently
mentions
her
cloak
this
would
not
be
what
ladies
call
a
cloak
now
but
more
what
would
be
described
as
a
fichu
or
tippet
covering
the
shoulders
and
having
long
ends
which
fell
like
a
stole
in
front
some
of
the
modern
fur
stoles
are
in
fact
made
very
much
on
the
same
pattern
no
lady
s
wardrobe
seems
to
have
been
complete
without
at
least
one
black
silk
cloak
of
this
sort
dresses
were
cut
low
in
front
either
in
v
shape
or
curved
and
even
in
winter
this
custom
was
followed
a
silk
handkerchief
was
sometimes
folded
crosswise
over
the
opening
but
very
generally
though
warmly
dressed
in
other
respects
a
lady
had
her
neck
quite
uncovered
the
short
sleeves
which
went
with
low
necks
necessitated
the
use
of
long
gloves
which
reached
above
the
elbow
and
were
tied
there
with
ribbon
the
high
waists
made
the
bodice
of
the
dress
so
small
that
it
was
of
very
little
consequence
and
sometimes
was
formed
merely
by
a
folded
bit
of
material
like
a
fichu
this
was
covered
by
that
fashionable
and
characteristic
garment
the
pelisse
it
was
not
considered
proper
for
very
young
girls
to
wear
pelisses
they
wore
cloaks
but
the
pelisse
did
not
really
differ
very
greatly
from
the
cloak
for
it
was
like
a
long
open
coat
fitting
closely
to
the
arm
but
falling
straight
in
long
ends
from
the
armholes
thus
leaving
the
front
of
the
dress
exposed
in
a
panel
later
pelisses
became
more
voluminous
and
completely
covered
the
dress
fastening
in
front
papendick
says
the
outdoor
equipment
in
those
days
when
pelisses
and
of
woollen
were
not
worn
by
girls
was
a
black
cloak
of
a
silk
called
mode
stiff
glossy
wadded
armholes
with
a
sleeve
to
the
wrist
from
them
a
small
muff
and
a
bonnet
all
of
the
same
huge
muffs
were
very
common
and
this
is
one
of
the
features
of
the
dress
of
that
date
which
is
generally
remembered
because
of
its
singularity
the
small
girls
were
dressed
in
long
skirts
plainly
made
and
their
robes
must
have
precluded
any
possibility
of
romping
the
short
skirts
and
long
stockinged
legs
of
our
present
mode
would
have
made
them
stare
indeed
as
for
the
materials
for
dresses
they
were
of
course
much
less
varied
than
the
inventions
of
printing
and
machinery
allow
women
to
use
nowadays
plain
muslins
or
muslins
embroidered
at
the
edge
were
most
common
though
there
were
other
materials
such
as
taffeta
sarsenet
and
bombazine
we
must
realise
also
that
any
lace
used
in
trimming
must
have
been
real
lace
there
was
no
stuff
at
a
yard
with
which
every
servant
girl
could
deck
herself
as
she
does
now
india
muslins
were
extremely
popular
and
seemed
to
have
been
worn
quite
regardless
of
the
climate
which
according
to
accounts
our
grandmothers
notwithstanding
does
not
seem
to
have
changed
remarkably
when
lady
newdigate
was
at
brighton
in
she
writes
to
her
husband
do
ask
of
your
female
croneys
if
they
have
any
wants
in
the
muslin
way
nothing
else
is
worn
in
gowns
by
any
rank
of
people
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
get
them
cheaper
here
but
great
choice
there
is
very
beautiful
and
real
in
january
jane
writes
from
steventon
i
shall
want
two
new
coloured
gowns
for
the
summer
for
my
pink
one
will
not
do
more
than
clear
me
from
steventon
i
shall
not
trouble
you
however
to
get
more
than
one
of
them
and
that
is
to
be
a
plain
brown
cambric
muslin
for
morning
wear
the
other
which
is
to
be
a
very
pretty
yellow
and
white
cloud
i
mean
to
buy
in
bath
buy
two
brown
ones
if
you
please
and
both
of
a
length
but
one
longer
than
the
is
for
a
tall
woman
seven
yards
for
my
mother
seven
yards
and
a
half
for
me
a
dark
brown
but
the
kind
of
brown
is
left
to
your
own
choice
and
i
had
rather
they
were
different
as
it
will
be
always
something
to
say
to
dispute
about
which
is
the
prettiest
they
must
be
cambric
ten
years
later
muslins
are
still
fashionable
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
i
am
getting
very
extravagant
she
was
at
this
time
in
london
and
spending
all
my
money
and
what
is
worse
for
you
i
have
been
spending
all
yours
too
for
in
a
linendraper
s
shop
to
which
i
went
for
checked
muslin
and
for
which
i
was
obliged
to
give
seven
shillings
a
yard
i
was
tempted
by
a
pretty
coloured
muslin
and
bought
ten
yards
of
it
on
the
chance
of
your
liking
it
but
at
the
same
time
if
it
should
not
suit
you
you
must
not
think
yourself
at
all
obliged
to
take
it
it
is
only
three
and
six
per
yard
and
i
should
not
in
the
least
mind
taking
the
whole
in
texture
it
is
just
what
we
prefer
but
its
resemblance
to
green
crewels
i
must
own
is
not
great
for
the
pattern
is
a
small
red
that
silly
and
affected
nomenclature
for
the
dress
fabrics
was
in
use
then
as
it
is
still
is
apparent
from
hannah
more
s
remark
one
lady
asked
what
was
the
newest
colour
the
other
answered
that
the
most
truly
fashionable
silk
was
a
de
lined
with
a
etouffée
et
bradée
de
l
now
you
must
not
consult
your
dictionary
for
the
word
for
you
will
there
find
that
it
means
nothing
but
hope
whereas
in
the
new
language
of
the
time
means
the
most
particular
description
of
a
dress
jane
ever
gives
is
almost
minute
enough
to
be
followed
by
a
dressmaker
it
is
to
be
a
round
gown
with
a
jacket
and
a
frock
front
to
open
at
the
side
the
jacket
is
all
in
one
with
the
body
and
comes
as
far
as
the
pocket
half
a
quarter
of
a
yard
deep
i
suppose
all
the
way
round
cut
off
straight
at
the
corners
with
a
broad
hem
no
fulness
appears
either
in
the
body
or
the
flap
the
back
is
quite
the
side
equally
so
the
front
is
sloped
round
to
the
bosom
and
drawn
in
and
there
is
to
be
a
frill
of
the
same
to
put
on
occasionally
when
all
one

handkerchiefs
are
dirty
which
frill
must
fall
back
she
is
to
put
two
breadths
and
a
half
in
the
tail
and
no
not
being
so
much
worn
as
they
were
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
sleeves
they
are
to
be
plain
with
a
fulness
of
the
same
falling
down
and
gathered
up
underneath
low
in
the
back
behind
and
a
belt
of
the
it
is
of
course
most
obvious
that
the
ludicrous
fashions
and
enormous
erections
which
were
carried
by
the
leaders
of
fashion
did
not
affect
quiet
country
girls
just
as
in
our
own
time
the
distorted
sleeves
or
skirts
and
all
the
vagaries
of
the
smart
set
are
known
and
seen
by
hundreds
who
daily
go
about
in
perfectly
simple
clothes
which
yet
can
not
be
called
unfashionable
because
they
conform
in
main
points
to
the
dictates
of
the
fashion
of
the
moment
without
going
to
excess
two
more
characteristic
quotations
from
the
letters
must
be
how
do
you
like
your
flounce
we
have
seen
only
plain
flounces
i
hope
you
have
not
cut
off
the
train
of
your
bombazine
i
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
giving
them
up
as
morning
gowns
they
are
so
very
sweet
by
candlelight
i
would
rather
sacrifice
my
blue
one
for
that
purpose
in
short
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
care
and
in
the
following
year
i
have
determined
to
trim
my
lilac
sarsenet
with
lilac
satin
ribbon
just
as
my
chine
crape
is
sixpenny
width
at
bottom
threepenny
or
fourpenny
at
top
ribbon
trimmings
are
all
the
fashion
at
bath
with
this
addition
it
will
be
a
very
useful
gown
happy
to
go
in
one
small
point
the
lady
of
the
eighteenth
century
resembled
her
successor
of
of
november
notes
what
is
still
more
remarkable
is
the
total
abjuration
of
the
female
pocket
every
fashionable
fair
carries
her
purse
in
her
workbag
and
she
has
the
pleasure
of
laying
everything
that
belongs
to
her
upon
the
table
wherever
she

were
worn
in
court
dress
long
after
they

someone
describes
them
as
the
excrescences
and
balconies
with
which
modern
hoydens
overwhelm
and
barricade

we
gather
that
the

was
dressed
very
full

high

quite
off

that

neckerchiefs
with

open
to
display
irresistible

s
dress
of
the
same
period
was
most
magnificent
and
perhaps
the
feature
of
it
that
would
strike
one
most
in
contrast
with
modern
fashions
would
be
its
variety
of
colour

and
waistcoats

always
coloured

only
donned

except
for
himself
there
wasn

a

of

anywhere
in

dress
of
the

he
considered
it
altogether
as

a
fairly
good
idea
of
the
different
degrees

and

be

in

already
quoted
the
following
account
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
young
gentleman
of
fashion
i
ride
in
a
chair
with
my
hands
in
a
muff
and
have
bought
a
silk
coat
and
embroidered
the
cuff
but
the
weather
was
cold
and
the
coat
it
was
thin
so
the
tailor
advised
me
to
line
it
with
skin
but
what
with
my
nivernois
hat
can
compare
and
laced
ruffles
and
black
solitaire
and
what
can
a
man
of
true
fashion
denote
like
an
ell
of
good
ribbon
tied
under
the
throat
my
buckles
and
box
are
in
exquisite
taste
the
one
is
of
paper
the
other
of
fox
when
a
very
young
man
was
a
prodigious
dandy
wearing
a
little
odd
french
hat
shoes
with
red
heels
etc
he
and
lord
carlisle
once
travelled
from
paris
to
lyons
for
the
express
purpose
of
buying
waistcoats
and
during
the
whole
journey
they
talked
about
nothing
else
rogers
jane
austen
s
brother
edward
would
dress
as
befitted
his
position
with
greater
variety
of
colour
and
style
than
his
clergyman
father
and
brother
it
was
the
usual
thing
for
a
clergyman
to
dress
in
black
with
and
white
stock
but
it
was
not
essential
in
when
henry
tilney
is
first
introduced
to
catherine
in
the
lower
rooms
at
bath
there
is
nothing
in
his
attire
to
indicate
that
he
is
a
clergyman
a
fact
which
she
only
learns
subsequently
in
ordinary
civilian
dress
men
wore
long
green
blue
or
brown
cloth
coats
with
stocks
and
frilled
ruffles
in
the
of
a
man
casually
met
with
is
wearing
a
brownish
coat
with
a
narrow
gold
edging
and
his
companion
an
old
green
frock
with
a
buff
coloured
waistcoat
while
an
trying
to
play
the
gentleman
has
on
a
white
frock
and
a
red
laced
at
that
time
footgear
for
men
consisted
of
slippers
in
the
house
and
for
out
of
doors
when
beau
nash
was
forming
the
assemblies
at
bath
as
has
been
said
he
made
a
dead
set
against
the
habit
some
men
had
of
wearing
boots
in
the
the
gentlemen
s
boots
also
made
a
very
desperate
stand
against
him
the
country
squires
were
by
no
means
submissive
to
his
usurpations
and
probably
his
authority
alone
would
never
have
carried
him
through
had
he
not
reinforced
it
with
his
ridicule
took
the
form
of
a
squib
one
verse
of
which
was
as
follows
come
trollops
and
slatterns
cockt
hats
and
white
aprons
this
best
our
modesty
suits
for
why
should
not
we
in
dress
be
as
free
as
squires
in
the
keenness
severity
and
particularly
the
good
rhymes
of
this
little
which
was
at
that
time
highly
relished
by
many
of
the
nobility
at
bath
gained
him
a
temporary
triumph
but
to
push
his
victories
he
got
up
a
puppet
show
in
which
punch
came
in
booted
and
spurred
in
the
character
of
a
country
squire
when
told
to
pull
off
his
boots
he
replies
why
madam
you
may
as
well
bid
me
pull
off
my
legs
i
never
go
without
boots
i
never
ride
i
never
dance
without
them
and
this
piece
of
politeness
is
quite
the
thing
in
bath
we
always
dance
at
our
town
in
boots
and
the
ladies
often
move
minuets
in
riding
from
this
time
few
ventured
to
appear
at
the
assemblies
in
bath
in
riding
of
chapter
xiv
at
southampton
for
two
and
a
half
years
that
is
to
say
from
may
to
september
we
do
not
hear
any
more
of
jane
austen
from
her
own
correspondence
then
while
she
was
staying
at
lyme
she
sent
a
letter
to
her
sister
which
is
given
in
s
it
will
be
remembered
that
part
of
the
scene
in
takes
place
at
lyme
where
the
principal
characters
are
transported
and
where
louisa
musgrove
meets
with
her
accident
captain
wentworth
s
friend
captain
harville
had
settled
there
for
the
winter
and
wrote
such
a
glowing
account
of
the
fine
country
around
that
the
young
people
were
all
wild
to
see
the
party
that
finally
went
were
the
heroine
anne
elliot
herself
her
brother
and
her
two
friends
henrietta
and
louisa
musgrove
and
her
quondam
lover
captain
wentworth
who
was
at
this
time
paying
rather
more
attention
to
louisa
musgrove
than
could
be
borne
with
easiness
by
poor
anne
who
had
realised
the
dreadful
mistake
she
had
made
in
giving
him
up
seven
years
before
they
were
come
too
late
in
the
year
for
any
amusement
or
variety
which
lyme
as
a
public
place
might
offer
the
rooms
were
shut
up
the
lodgers
almost
gone
scarcely
any
family
but
the
residents
as
there
is
nothing
to
admire
in
the
buildings
themselves
the
remarkable
situation
of
the
town
the
principal
street
almost
hurrying
into
the
water
the
walk
to
the
cobb
skirting
round
the
pleasant
little
bay
which
in
the
season
is
animated
with
bathing
machines
and
company
the
cobb
itself
its
old
wonders
and
new
improvements
with
the
very
beautiful
line
of
cliffs
stretching
out
to
the
east
of
the
town
are
what
the
stranger
s
eye
will
seek
and
a
very
strange
stranger
it
must
be
who
does
not
see
charms
in
the
immediate
environs
of
lyme
to
make
him
wish
to
know
it
better
the
scenes
in
its
neighbourhood
charmouth
with
its
high
grounds
and
extensive
sweeps
of
country
and
still
more
its
sweet
retired
bay
backed
by
dark
cliffs
where
fragments
of
low
rock
among
the
sands
make
it
the
happiest
spot
for
watching
the
flow
of
the
tide
for
sitting
in
unwearied
contemplation
the
woody
varieties
of
the
cheerful
vista
of
up
lyme
and
above
all
pinny
with
its
green
chasms
between
romantic
rocks
where
the
scattered
forest
trees
and
orchards
of
luxuriant
growth
declare
that
many
a
generation
must
have
passed
away
since
the
first
partial
falling
of
the
cliff
prepared
the
ground
for
such
a
state
where
a
scene
so
wonderful
and
so
lovely
is
exhibited
as
may
more
than
equal
any
of
the
resembling
scenes
of
the
isle
of
wight
these
places
must
be
visited
and
visited
again
to
make
the
worth
of
lyme
it
is
wonderful
that
jane
should
have
remembered
in
such
detail
a
place
which
she
had
apparently
only
seen
on
one
visit
and
that
many
years
before
she
wrote
the
book
in
which
the
description
is
embodied
but
it
is
not
unlikely
that
as
the
instinct
of
was
strong
within
her
she
wrote
down
some
such
account
on
the
spot
and
had
it
for
reference
afterwards
louisa
s
wilfulness
in
leaping
down
the
steps
of
the
cobb
and
her
subsequent
accident
at
which
captain
wentworth
deceives
anne
further
as
to
the
real
state
of
his
feelings
by
displaying
much
poignant
and
unnecessary
grief
form
the
chief
episode
in
the
book
while
at
lyme
herself
jane
took
part
in
the
usual
amusements
she
went
to
a
dance
and
was
escorted
back
by
james
and
a
lanthorn
though
i
believe
the
lanthorn
was
not
lit
as
the
moon
was
she
walked
on
the
cobb
and
bathed
in
the
morning
also
she
looked
after
the
housekeeping
for
her
father
and
mother
who
were
with
her
in
lodgings
this
was
in
september
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
year
her
father
died
but
there
is
no
letter
yet
published
from
which
we
can
judge
any
of
the
details
or
the
state
of
her
feelings
at
this
great
loss
in
the
april
after
this
event
there
are
two
letters
given
by
written
from
gay
street
bath
in
which
no
allusion
is
made
to
her
father
s
death
she
and
her
mother
were
then
in
lodgings
it
was
at
the
end
of
this
year
that
they
moved
to
southampton
jane
s
pen
had
not
been
altogether
idle
while
at
bath
for
it
is
supposed
that
she
there
wrote
the
fragment
which
is
embodied
in
s
it
must
also
have
been
at
this
time
that
the
of
was
offered
to
the
bath
bookseller
a
transaction
which
is
described
elsewhere
before
leaving
bath
jane
went
to
stay
with
her
brother
edward
knight
at
godmersham
this
was
in
august
of
the
same
year
godmersham
to
which
the
austen
girls
so
often
went
on
visits

thus
described
by

who
certainly
had
every
right
to
godmersham
park
is
situated
in
one
of
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
kent
namely
in
the
valley
of
the
stour
which
lies
between
ashford
and
canterbury
soon
after
you
pass
the
wye
station
of
the
railway
from
the
former
to
the
latter
place
you
see
godmersham
church
on
your
left
hand
and
just
beyond
it
comes
into
view
the
wall
which
shuts
off
the
shrubberies
and
pleasure
grounds
of
the
great
house
from
the
road
close
to
the
church
nestles
the
home
farm
and
beyond
it
the
rectory
with
lawn
sloping
down
to
the
river
stour
which
for
a
distance
of
nearly
a
mile
runs
through
the
east
end
of
the
park
a
little
beyond
the
church
you
see
the
mansion
between
which
and
the
railroad
lies
the
village
divided
by
the
old
high
road
from
ashford
to
canterbury
nearly
opposite
godmersham
the
valley
of
the
stour
makes
a
break
in
that
ridge
of
chalk
hills
the
proper
name
of
which
is
the
backbone
of
kent
so
that
godmersham
park
beyond
the
house
is
upon
the
chalk
downs
and
on
its
further
side
is
bounded
by
king
s
wood
a
large
tract
of
woodland
containing
many
hundred
acres
and
possessed
by
several
different
the
children
of
edward
and
elizabeth
were
now
growing
up
the
eldest
boy
edward
was
delicate
and
there
was
some
talk
of
taking
him
to
worthing
instead
of
sending
him
back
to
school
however
he
apparently
grew
stronger
for
he
returned
to
school
again
with
his
brother
george
the
next
two
boys
were
henry
and
william
jane
says
she
has
been
playing
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
the
younger
of
the
two
he
and
i
have
practised
together
two
mornings
and
improve
a
little
we
have
frequently
kept
it
up
three
times
and
once
or
twice
the
eldest
girl
fanny
had
become
almost
as
dear
as
a
sister
to
her
aunt
and
the
next
elizabeth
are
also
mentioned
in
the
letters
there
were
besides
these
younger
children
two
more
boys
and
three
girls
a
fine
family
before
coming
to
godmersham
jane
had
stayed
at

george
hatton
and
his
wife
lady
elizabeth
lived
their
eldest
son
succeeded
later
to
the
title
of
ninth
earl
of
winchilsea
jane
mentions
this
lad
as
a
fine
boy
but
was
chiefly
delighted
with
his
younger
brother
daniel
who
afterwards
married
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
warwick
at
the
time
she
wrote
this
letter
cassandra
was
at
goodnestone
with
the
bridges
the
two
sisters
soon
after
changed
places
crossing
on
the
journey
as
jane
went
to
goodnestone
and
cassandra
to
godmersham
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
carriage
transit
journeys
must
frequently
have
been
arranged
thus
to
save
the
horses
double
work
jane
in
writing
from
goodnestone
alludes
much
to
the
two
bridges
girls
harriet
and
her
delicate
sister
marianne
there
was
to
be
a
great
ball
at
deal
for
which
harriet
bridges
received
a
ticket
and
an
invitation
to
stay
at
dover
but
this
was
suddenly
put
off
on
account
of
the
death
of
the
duke
of
gloucester
brother
of
george
iii
jane
opined
that
everybody
would
go
into
mourning
on
his
account
mourning
was
of
course
much
more
generally
used
then
than
now
and
everyone
seems
to
have
rushed
into
it
whether
they
belonged
to
the
court
or
not
on
the
death
of
any
member
of
the
royal
family
during
the
four
years
that
had
passed
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
europe
had
been
in
a
continual
turmoil
a
turmoil
that
could
never
cease
while
napoleon
was
at
liberty
the
battle
of
alexandria
in
the
first
year
of
the
new
century
had
taught
him
that
the
english
were
as
formidable
on
land
as
on
sea
and
the
battle
of
the
baltic
in
the
following
month
further
convinced
him
that
there
was
one
unconquered
nation
that
dared
oppose
him
he
recognised
however
that
while
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
britain
on
the
sea
and
in
places
accessible
by
sea
he
could
do
much
as
he
pleased
on
the
continent
therefore
a
compromise
was
arrived
at
and
on
march
the
treaty
of
amiens
was
signed
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
the
strain
of
war
was
relaxed
in
great
britain
the
arrogance
of
napoleon
however
made
a
continuous
peace
impossible
and
by
the
spring
of
the
next
year
the
two
nations
were
again
ready
to
spring
at
each
other
s
throats
napoleon
seized
and
detained
british
travellers
who
were
in
france
and
this
provoked
fury
in
great
britain
great
preparations
were
now
once
more
made
in
france
for
the
project
of
the
invasion
of
england
where
in
a
few
weeks
volunteers
were
enrolled
the
national
excitement
was
tremendous
and
jane
must
have
heard
at
least
as
much
about
the
preparations
for
war
and
the
dangers
of
invasion
even
in
the
frivolous
society
of
bath
as
about
dress
and
trivial
society
details
in
may
napoleon
threw
aside
all
disguise
and
had
himself
proclaimed
emperor
of
the
french
and
by
the
end
of
the
same
year
spain
having
thrown
in
her
lot
with
france
declared
war
also
against
england
the
whole
of
must
have
been
one
of
tense
excitement
to
everyone
with
a
brain
to
understand
the
future
of
england
trembled
in
the
balance
yet
jane
s
pleasant
letters
from
godmersham
deal
in
nothing
but
domestic
detail
and
small
talk
not
one
allusion
is
there
to
the
throes
which
threatened
to
rend
the
national
existence
in
the
autumn
of
both
the
sisters
had
returned
to
their
mother
who
in
their
absence
had
had
the
companionship
of
martha
lloyd
then
came
the
removal
to
southampton
where
they
went
to
a
commodious
house
in
a
corner
of
castle
writing
from
recollection
says
my
grandmother
s
house
had
a
pleasant
garden
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
old
city
walls
the
top
of
this
wall
was
sufficiently
wide
to
afford
a
pleasant
walk
with
an
extensive
view
easily
accessible
to
ladies
by
steps
at
that
time
castle
square
was
occupied
by
a
fantastic
edifice
too
large
for
the
space
in
which
it
stood
though
too
small
to
accord
well
with
its
castellated
style
erected
by
the
second
marquess
of
lansdowne
to
the
statesman
who
succeeded
him
in
the
title
the
marchioness
had
a
light
phaeton
drawn
by
six
and
sometimes
by
eight
little
ponies
each
pair
decreasing
in
size
and
becoming
lighter
in
colour
it
was
a
delight
to
me
to
look
down
from
the
window
and
see
this
fairy
equipage
put
together
for
the
premises
of
the
castle
were
so
contracted
that
the
whole
process
went
on
in
the
little
space
that
remained
of
the
open
square
on
the
death
of
the
marquess
in
the
castle
was
pulled
down
few
probably
remember
its
existence
and
anyone
who
might
visit
the
place
now
would
wonder
how
it
ever
could
have
stood
austen
was
not
well
off
for
her
husband
had
had
no
private
means
and
she
herself
but
little
yet
her
son
edward
was
well
able
to
help
her
for
chawton
alone
is
said
to
have
been
worth
a
year
there
was
also
money
in
the
family
for
jane
some
years
later
speaks
of
her
eldest
brother
s
income
being
a
year
she
and
her
sister
must
have
had
some
little
allowance
also
as
it
was
with
her
own
money
that
she
paid
for
the
publication
of
the
first
of
her
books
simply
as
she
had
always
lived
she
does
not
seem
to
have
had
small
ideas
on
the
subject
the
couples
in
her
books
require
about
two
thousand
a
year
before
they
can
be
considered
prosperous
and
incomes
of
from
five
thousand
to
ten
thousand
pounds
are
not
rare
she
makes
one
of
the
characters
in
remark
on
hearing
that
crawford
has
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
those
who
have
not
more
must
be
satisfied
with
what
they
have
four
thousand
a
year
is
a
pretty
there
was
apparently
some
question
raised
by
her
relations
about
the
income
bestowed
by
jane
upon
the
mother
and
daughters
in
and
namely
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
but
having
regard
to
all
the
circumstances
the
style
to
which
they
were
accustomed
and
dashwood
s
inability
to
economise
this
could
perhaps
hardly
have
been
made
less
we
hear
at
the
close
of
one
year
at
southampton
that
austen
is
pleased
at
the
comfortable
state
of
her
own
finances
which
she
finds
on
closing
her
year
s
accounts
beyond
her
expectation
as
she
begins
the
new
year
with
a
balance
of
thirty
pounds
in
her
and
afterwards
my
mother
is
afraid
i
have
not
been
explicit
enough
on
the
subject
of
her
wealth
she
began
with
pounds
she
begins
with
pounds
and
this
after
pounds
purchase
of
in
this
year
the
income
tax
was
increased
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
on
account
of
the
tremendous
war
expenditure
at
this
time
an
amicable
arrangement
had
been
arrived
at
by
which
frank
austen
and
his
wife
shared
the
house
of
the
mother
and
sisters
at
southampton
frank
himself
being
of
course
frequently
away
his
first
wife
mary
gibson
whom
he
had
only
recently
married
lived
until
and
is
referred
to
by
her
as
mrs
doubtless
to
distinguish
her
from
the
other
mary
james
s
wife
martha
lloyd
whom
frank
married
as
his
second
wife
long
long
after
seems
to
have
been
such
a
favourite
with
the
family
that
she
practically
lived
with
the
austens
at
southampton
as
her
own
mother
had
died
some
years
before
the
country
round
southampton
is
pretty
and
the
town
itself
pleasant
we
have
a
contemporary
description
of
it
in
southampton
is
one
of
the
most
neat
and
pleasant
towns
i
ever
saw
was
once
walled
round
many
large
stones
of
which
are
now
remaining
there
were
four
gates
only
three
now
it
consists
chiefly
of
one
long
fine
street
of
three
quarters
of
a
mile
in
length
called
the
high
street
the
polygon
not
far
distant
could
the
original
plan
have
been
completed
tis
said
would
have
been
one
of
the
first
places
in
the
kingdom
at
the
extremity
a
capital
building
was
erected
with
two
detached
wings
and
colonnades
the
centre
was
an
elegant
tavern
with
assembly
card
rooms
and
at
each
wing
hotels
to
accommodate
the
nobility
and
gentry
the
tavern
is
taken
down
but
the
wings
converted
into
genteel
lybbe
powys
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
record
of
the
first
year
spent
here
there
are
no
letters
preserved
and
we
know
that
jane
wrote
no
more
novels
household
affairs
and
altering
clothes
according
to
the
mode
must
have
filled
up
days
too
pleasantly
monotonous
to
have
anything
worth
recording
southampton
evidently
did
not
inspire
her
for
it
figures
in
none
of
her
books
though
its
neighbour
portsmouth
is
described
as
the
home
of
fanny
price
in
yet
in
october
just
at
the
time
jane
was
settling
into
her
new
home
was
fought
the
battle
of
trafalgar
which
smashed
the
allied
fleets
of
spain
and
france
and
freed
britain
from
any
fear
of
invasion
as
it
was
a
naval
battle
we
can
imagine
for
the
sake
of
her
brothers
she
must
have
thrilled
at
the
tremendous
news
which
would
arrive
as
fast
as
a
sailing
ship
could
bring
a
day
or
two
after
the
action
in
january
cassandra
was
again
at
godmersham
and
jane
writes
her
several
letters
full
of
family
detail
as
usual
james
austen
had
then
been
staying
at
southampton
with
his
wife
perhaps
they
had
brought
with
them
the
little
son
who
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
fairy
carriage
and
the
ponies
as
he
was
born
in
november
he
would
be
between
eight
and
nine
years
old
his
little
sister
caroline
certainly
was
there
for
she
is
mentioned
by
name
in
speaking
of
a
book
jane
draws
a
distinction
between
her
two
mrs
to
whom
it
is
new
enjoys
it
as
one
could
wish
the
other
mary
i
believe
has
little
pleasure
from
that
or
any
other
the
garden
at
southampton
was
evidently
the
cause
of
much
enjoyment
we
hear
that
we
are
envied
our
house
by
many
people
and
that
our
garden
is
the
best
in
the
our
garden
is
putting
in
good
order
by
a
man
who
bears
a
remarkably
good
character
has
a
very
fine
complexion
and
asks
something
less
than
the
first
the
shrubs
which
border
the
gravel
walk
he
says
are
only
sweet
briar
and
roses
and
the
latter
of
an
indifferent
sort
we
mean
to
get
a
few
of
a
better
kind
therefore
and
at
my
own
particular
desire
he
procures
us
some
syringas
i
could
not
do
without
a
syringa
for
the
sake
of
cowper
s
line
we
talk
also
of
a
laburnum
the
border
under
the
terrace
wall
is
clearing
away
to
receive
currants
and
gooseberry
bushes
and
a
spot
is
found
very
proper
for
in
this
extract
the
odd
use
of
the
active
for
the
passive
tense
in
fashion
in
the
eighteenth
century
jars
on
modern
ears
these
and
similar
constructions
used
throughout
the
novels
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
opinions
of
those
people
who
have
dismissed
these
brilliant
works
as
terrific
fighting
continued
on
the
continent
and
in
december
the
prestige
of
napoleon
was
enhanced
on
the
stubborn
field
of
austerlitz
in
the
beginning
of
england
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
by
death
the
great
minister
pitt
who
had
steered
her
through
such
perilous
times
it
is
said
that
the
news
of
austerlitz
was
the
final
blow
to
a
nature
worn
out
by
stress
and
anxiety
in
september
of
the
same
year
his
talented
but
inferior
rival
fox
died
also
in
this
year
was
issued
the
famous
berlin
decree
by
which
napoleon
prohibited
all
commerce
with
great
britain
and
declared
confiscated
any
british
merchandise
or
shipping
but
britain
had
spirit
enough
to
retort
in
the
following
year
with
a
decree
declaring
a
blockade
of
france
and
that
any
of
her
merchant
vessels
were
fair
prizes
unless
they
had
previously
touched
at
a
british
port
the
war
continued
without
intermission
throughout
austria
exhausted
had
sullenly
withdrawn
prussia
had
plucked
up
spirit
to
join
with
russia
in
opposing
the
conqueror
of
europe
but
in
june
after
the
hard
fought
battle
of
frieland
france
concluded
with
russia
the
secret
peace
of
tilsit
based
upon
mutual
hatred
of
england
england
however
soon
found
out
the
menace
directed
against
her
and
as
the
french
troops
marched
to
denmark
evidently
with
the
intention
of
summoning
that
country
to
use
her
fleet
in
accordance
with
their
orders
england
by
a
prompt
and
brilliant
countermove
appeared
before
copenhagen
first
and
by
bombarding
the
town
compelled
submission
and
carried
away
the
whole
fleet
for
safety
s
sake
those
were
glorious
days
for
the
navy
when
measures
were
prompt
and
decisive
when
no
hesitation
and
and
fear
of
hurting
the
feelings
of
an
unscrupulous
enemy
prevented
britain
from
taking
care
of
herself
britain
was
now
at
war
with
russia
and
denmark
as
well
as
france
but
the
unprecedented
duplicity
of
napoleon
in
spain
in
gave
britain
an
unexpected
field
on
which
to
do
battle
and
allies
by
no
means
to
be
despised
spain
was
france
s
ally
yet
france
after
marching
through
the
country
to
crush
portugal
quietly
annexed
the
country
of
their
ally
in
returning
and
by
a
ruse
made
the
whole
royal
family
prisoners
in
france
while
napoleon
s
brother
joseph
king
of
naples
was
subsequently
proclaimed
king
the
spaniards
were
aroused
and
though
the
best
of
their
troops
had
been
previously
drawn
off
into
germany
by
the
tyrant
they
managed
to
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
even
against
the
invincible
french
joseph
buonaparte
had
been
proclaimed
king
of
spain
in
june
in
that
month
jane
was
at
godmersham
again
and
though
she
did
not
know
it
this
was
the
last
visit
she
would
pay
before
the
death
of
edward
knight
which
occurred
in
the
following
october
at
the
birth
of
her
eleventh
child
jane
seems
to
have
noticed
her
was
not
in
good
health
she
says
i
can
not
praise
elizabeth
s
looks
but
they
are
probably
affected
by
a
illustration
fashions
for
ladies
in
and
james
austen
accompanied
her
on
this
visit
and
her
account
of
the
arrival
gives
such
a
homely
picture
that
trivial
as
it
is
it
is
worth
quoting
our
two
brothers
were
walking
before
the
house
as
we
approached
as
natural
as
life
fanny
and
lizzy
met
us
in
the
hall
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasant
joy
fanny
came
to
me
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
her
aunt
james
to
her
room
and
stayed
while
i
dressed
she
is
grown
both
in
height
and
size
since
last
year
but
not
immoderately
looks
very
well
and
seems
as
to
conduct
and
manner
just
what
she
was
and
what
one
could
wish
her
to
yesterday
passed
quite
à
la
godmersham
the
gentlemen
rode
about
edward
s
farm
and
returned
in
time
to
saunter
along
bentigh
with
us
and
after
dinner
we
visited
the
temple
plantations
james
and
mary
are
much
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
lord
brabourne
gives
a
note
on
the
temple
plantation
it
was
once
a
ploughed
field
but
when
my
grandfather
first
came
to
godmersham
he
planted
it
with
underwood
and
made
gravel
walks
through
it
planted
an
avenue
of
trees
on
each
side
of
the
principal
walk
and
added
it
to
the
shrubberies
the
family
always
walked
through
it
on
their
way
to
church
leaving
the
shrubberies
by
a
little
door
in
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
private
the
casual
sentence
mary
finds
the
children
less
troublesome
than
she
expected
adds
one
more
stroke
to
the
character
of
that
which
jane
makes
us
know
so
well
knight
senior
was
still
living
and
was
generous
toward
the
other
members
of
her
adopted
son
s
family
besides
himself
this
morning
brought
me
a
letter
from
knight
containing
the
usual
fee
and
all
the
usual
kindness
she
asks
me
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
her
this
week
her
very
agreeable
present
will
make
my
circumstances
quite
easy
i
shall
reserve
half
for
my
it
will
be
remembered
that
edward
knight
had
been
a
miss
bridges
and
the
harriet
her
sister
was
now
staying
at
godmersham
with
her
own
husband
moore
whom
jane
did
not
think
good
enough
for
her
though
she
admits
later
he
is
a
sensible
man
and
tells
a
story
she
refers
to
her
s
opinion
of
her
mary
was
very
disappointed
in
her
beauty
and
thought
him
very
disagreeable
james
admires
her
and
finds
him
pleasant
and
it
was
at
the
conclusion
of
this
visit
that
jane
wrote
to
her
sister
of
the
pressing
necessity
of
coming
home
again
to
meet
the
visitor
with
whom
her
honour
as
well
as
affection
were
engaged
she
was
now
no
longer
a
young
girl
and
not
at
all
likely
to
mistake
the
nature
of
attentions
of
which
she
had
had
her
full
share
however
it
was
whether
the
visitor
did
not
come
or
coming
proved
himself
unequal
to
her
ideal
we
do
not
know
and
in
any
case
the
romance
so
mysteriously
suggested
by
these
few
words
must
ever
remain
in
the
shadow
jane
speaks
with
pleasure
of
her
elizabeth
having
a
very
sweet
scheme
of
accompanying
edward
into
kent
next
alas
before
that
christmas
came
the
loving
mother
who
seems
to
have
been
in
every
way
a
perfect
wife
and
sister
was
no
more
when
this
sad
event
occurred
in
october
the
sisters
had
again
changed
places
cassandra
being
at
godmersham
and
jane
at
southampton
the
first
of
jane
s
letters
of
this
period
is
congratulatory
on
the
birth
of
edward
s
eleventh
child
and
sixth
son
but
very
shortly
afterwards
she
writes
in
real
sorrow
at
the
dreadful
news
which
has
reached
her
of
the
death
of
her
dear
the
news
came
by
way
of
james
austen
and
her
sister
martha
who
was
at
southampton
we
have
do
you
all
as
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
for
you
for
fanny
for
henry
for
lady
bridges
and
for
dearest
edward
whose
loss
and
whose
sufferings
seem
to
make
those
of
every
other
person
nothing
god
be
praised
that
you
can
say
what
you
do
of
him
that
he
has
a
religious
mind
to
bear
him
up
and
a
disposition
that
will
gradually
lead
him
to
comfort
my
dear
dear
fanny
i
am
so
thankful
that
she
has
you
with
her
you
will
be
everything
to
her
you
will
give
her
all
the
consolation
that
human
aid
can
give
may
the
almighty
sustain
you
all
and
keep
you
my
dearest
cassandra
with
what
true
sympathy
our
feelings
are
shared
by
martha
you
need
not
be
told
she
is
the
friend
and
sister
under
every
poor
fanny
was
then
in
her
sixteenth
year
the
time
when
a
girl
perhaps
feels
the
loss
of
a
sensible
affectionate
mother
more
than
any
other
she
acquitted
herself
splendidly
in
the
difficult
task
that
fell
on
her
as
the
eldest
of
so
many
brothers
and
sisters
her
next
sister
lizzy
was
at
this
time
only
eight
years
old
and
though
she
seems
to
have
felt
the
loss
keenly
it
could
not
be
the
same
to
her
as
it
was
to
fanny
mourning
at
that
time
entailed
heavy
crape
and
jane
at
once
fitted
herself
out
with
all
that
was
proper
the
two
eldest
boys
edward
and
george
were
by
this
time
at
winchester
college
but
when
their
mother
died
they
went
first
to
their
aunt
and
uncle
at
steventon
and
on
october
came
on
to
southampton
jane
s
next
letter
is
full
of
them
they
behave
extremely
well
in
every
respect
showing
quite
as
much
feeling
as
one
wishes
to
see
and
on
every
occasion
speaking
of
their
father
with
the
liveliest
affection
his
letter
was
read
over
by
each
of
them
yesterday
and
with
many
tears
george
sobbed
aloud
edward
s
tears
do
not
flow
so
easily
but
as
far
as
i
can
judge
they
are
both
very
properly
impressed
by
what
has
happened
george
is
almost
a
new
acquaintance
to
me
and
i
find
him
in
a
different
way
as
engaging
as
edward
we
do
not
want
amusement
bilbocatch
at
which
george
is
indefatigable
spillikens
paper
ships
riddles
conundrums
and
cards
with
watching
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
river
and
now
and
then
a
stroll
out
keep
us
well
rhymed
charades
were
a
very
common
form
of
amusement
at
that
date
and
all
the
austen
family
excelled
in
them
it
will
be
remembered
that
elton
s
charade
of
which
the
meaning
was
courtship
further
misled
the
emma
into
thinking
he
was
in
love
with
harriet
the
dowerless
while
she
herself
the
heiress
was
the
real
object
of
his
attentions
several
charades
of
this
type
made
up
by
the
austens
are
still
extant
the
two
following
are
jane
s
own
divided
i
m
a
gentleman
in
public
deeds
and
powers
united
i
m
a
monster
who
that
gentleman
to
which
the
answer
is
you
may
lie
on
my
first
by
the
side
of
a
stream
and
my
second
compose
to
the
nymph
you
adore
but
if
when
you
ve
none
of
my
whole
her
esteem
and
affection
of
her
no
which
is
easily
read
as
both
of
these
specimens
show
the
gaiety
of
spirit
so
noticeable
in
the
smallest
extracts
from
her
letters
her
observations
on
her
nephews
put
the
two
boys
before
us
to
the
life
while
i
write
now
george
is
most
industriously
making
and
manning
paper
ships
at
which
he
afterwards
shoots
horse
chestnuts
brought
from
steventon
on
purpose
and
edward
equally
intent
over
the
lake
of
killarney
and
twisting
himself
about
in
one
of
our
great
her
wonderful
powers
as
an
entertainer
are
clearly
shown
in
this
sad
time
when
she
strove
to
keep
her
nephews
occupied
to
the
exclusion
of
sad
thoughts
she
took
them
for
excursions
on
the
itchen
when
they
rowed
her
in
a
boat
and
she
was
never
weary
of
entering
into
their
sports
and
feelings
her
real
unselfishness
came
out
very
strongly
on
this
occasion
sir
arthur
wellesley
had
sailed
for
spain
in
the
july
of
this
year
and
now
england
was
in
the
throes
of
the
peninsular
war
some
of
the
very
few
allusions
that
jane
ever
makes
to
contemporary
events
are
to
be
found
in
reference
to
the
peninsular
war
and
these
are
more
personal
than
general
on
hearing
of
sir
john
moore
s
death
in
january
she
writes
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
sir
moore
has
a
mother
living
but
though
a
very
heroic
son
he
might
not
be
a
very
necessary
one
to
her
happiness
i
wish
sir
john
had
united
something
of
the
christian
with
the
hero
in
his
death
thank
heaven
we
have
had
no
one
to
care
for
particularly
among
the
troops
no
one
in
fact
nearer
to
us
than
sir
john
chapter
xv
chawton
in
another
move
was
contemplated
edward
knight
had
found
it
in
his
power
to
offer
his
mother
and
sisters
a
home
rent
free
and
he
gave
them
the
choice
of
a
house
in
kent
probably
not
far
from
godmersham
or
a
cottage
at
chawton
close
to
his
manor
house
there
the
latter
offer
was
accepted
and
preparations
were
made
to
alter
the
cottage
which
had
been
a
steward
s
residence
into
a
comfortable
dwelling
the
cottage
is
still
standing
close
by
the
main
road
and
may
be
seen
by
anyone
in
passing
it
is
of
considerable
size
and
there
are
six
bedrooms
besides
garrets
it
stands
close
to
the
junction
of
two
roads
one
of
which
passes
through
winchester
to
southampton
and
the
other
through
fareham
to
gosport
chawton
lies
about
as
far
of
winchester
as
steventon
does
north
the
considerable
country
town
of
alton
which
would
be
convenient
for
shopping
is
only
about
a
mile
from
the
village
the
cottage
dreary
and
in
appearance
is
of
a
solid
square
shape
and
abuts
on
the
with
only
a
paling
in
front
it
is
not
an
attractive
looking
dwelling
but
probably
at
the
time
was
fresher
and
brighter
in
appearance
than
it
is
now
it
had
also
the
advantage
of
a
good
garden
it
is
now
partially
used
for
a
club
or
and
partially
by
cottagers
at
the
junction
of
the
two
roads
aforesaid
is
a
muddy
pond
that
which
was
playfully
referred
to
by
jane
in
writing
to
her
nephew
who
had
not
been
well
when
she
says
you
may
be
ordered
to
a
house
by
the
sea
or
by
a
very
considerable
a
short
distance
along
the
gosport
road
is
the
entrance
gate
to
the
manor
house
and
about
fifty
yards
up
the
drive
is
the
pretty
little
church
considerably
altered
since
jane
s
time
with
pinnacled
and
tower
just
above
it
is
the
fine
old
elizabethan
house
in
one
william
knight
had
a
lease
of
the
place
the
house
itself
was
probably
built
by
his
son
john
who
bought
the
estate
and
it
has
remained
ever
since
in
the
hands
of
the
knight
family
if
we
may
count
adoption
as
ranking
in
family
inheritance
the
move
to
chawton
was
evidently
some
time
in
contemplation
before
actually
taking
place
for
writing
in
december
jane
says
that
they
want
to
be
settled
at
chawton
in
time
for
henry
to
come
to
us
for
some
shooting
in
october
at
least
or
a
little
earlier
and
edward
may
visit
us
after
taking
his
boys
back
to
winchester
suppose
we
name
the
fourth
of
of
the
actual
settling
in
at
chawton
we
have
no
details
for
the
next
batch
of
letters
begins
in
april
and
jane
with
her
mother
and
sister
had
been
there
about
a
year
and
a
half
chawton
was
her
home
for
the
rest
of
her
short
life
though
she
actually
died
at
winchester
at
chawton
her
three
last
novels
were
written
as
will
be
recounted
in
detail
it
is
curious
that
the
periods
of
her
literary
activity
seem
to
have
been
synchronous
with
her
residence
in
the
country
at
steventon
and
at
chawton
respectively
she
produced
three
novels
at
bath
only
a
fragment
and
at
southampton
nothing
at
all
the
life
at
chawton
during
this
and
the
next
few
years
must
have
been
part
of
the
happiest
time
she
ever
experienced
her
first
book
and
was
published
in
she
had
tasted
the
joys
of
earning
money
and
what
was
much
greater
the
joy
of
seeing
her
own
ideas
and
characters
in
tangible
shape
she
lived
in
a
comfortable
pretty
home
with
the
comings
and
goings
of
her
relatives
at
the
manor
house
to
add
variety
and
she
had
probably
lost
the
restlessness
of
girlhood
if
the
conjecture
of
which
we
have
spoken
in
a
previous
chapter
was
true
she
had
now
had
time
to
get
over
a
sorrow
which
must
have
taken
its
place
with
those
sweet
unrealised
dreams
in
which
the
pain
is
much
softened
by
retrospect
that
she
fully
appreciated
her
country
surroundings
is
shown
by
frequent
notes
on
the
garden
at
chawton
our
young
piony
at
the
foot
of
the
firtree
has
just
blown
and
looks
very
handsome
and
the
whole
of
the
shrubbery
border
will
soon
be
very
gay
with
pinks
and
sweet
williams
in
addition
to
the
columbines
already
in
bloom
the
syringas
too
are
coming
out
we
are
likely
to
have
a
great
crop
of
orleans
plums
but
not
many
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
nice
walk
we
have
round
the
orchard
the
row
of
beech
look
very
pretty
and
so
does
the
young
hedge
in
the
garden
i
hear
that
an
apricot
has
been
detected
on
one
of
the
yesterday
i
had
the
agreeable
surprise
of
finding
several
scarlet
strawberries
quite
ripe
there
are
more
strawberries
and
fewer
currants
than
i
thought
at
first
we
must
buy
currants
for
our
thus
the
seasons
are
marked
the
austens
ate
their
own
tender
young
peas
from
the
garden
and
my
mother
s
chickens
supplied
the
table
austen
at
this
time
seems
to
have
taken
a
new
lease
of
life
she
busied
herself
with
garden
and
poultry
and
did
not
shirk
even
the
harder
details
necessitated
by
these
occupations
her
granddaughter
anna
james
s
eldest
daughter
now
grown
up
was
a
constant
visitor
at
the
cottage
and
speaks
of
austen
s
wearing
a
round
green
frock
like
a
day
labourer
and
digging
her
own
anna
enjoyed
the
little
gaieties
that
fell
to
her
lot
as
freshly
as
her
aunt
had
done
at
her
age
indeed
with
even
more
simplicity
for
jane
remarks
of
one
ball
to
which
she
went
it
would
not
have
satisfied
me
at
her
and
again
anna
had
a
delightful
evening
at
the
miss
middletons
syllabub
tea
coffee
singing
dancing
a
hot
supper
eleven
o
clock
everything
that
can
be
imagined
agreeable
as
if
the
freshness
of
anna
s
youth
were
very
fresh
indeed
the
beautiful
park
stretching
around
chawton
house
with
its
fine
beech
trees
was
of
course
quite
open
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
cottage
who
must
have
derived
many
advantages
from
their
near
relationship
to
the
owner
altogether
with
the
freedom
from
care
for
the
future
the
companionship
of
her
sister
the
increased
health
and
energy
of
her
mother
the
solace
of
her
writing
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
chawton
party
and
the
occasional
visits
to
london
and
elsewhere
to
give
her
fresh
ideas
jane
s
life
must
have
been
as
pleasant
as
external
circumstances
could
make
it
we
can
picture
her
sauntering
out
in
the
early
summer
sunshine
her
head
demurely
encased
in
the
inevitable
cap
while
the
long
stray
curl
tickles
her
cheek
as
she
stoops
to
see
the
buds
bursting
into
bloom
or
triumphantly
gathers
the
earliest
rose
we
can
picture
her
standing
about
watching
austen
feeding
the
chickens
and
giving
her
opinion
as
to
their
management
then
going
in
to
the
little
parlour
or
and
sitting
down
to
the
piano
while
cassandra
manipulated
an
tambour
frame
in
this
little
parlour
in
spite
of
frequent
interruptions
jane
did
all
her
writing
sitting
at
the
big
heavy
mahogany
desk
of
the
old
style
like
a
wooden
box
which
opened
at
a
slant
so
as
to
form
a
support
for
the
paper
at
this
time
she
was
revising
and
for
the
press
or
adding
something
to
the
growing
pile
of
called
we
can
not
imagine
that
she
wrote
much
at
a
time
for
her
work
is
minute
small
and
well
digested
probably
after
a
scene
or
conversation
between
two
of
the
characters
she
would
be
interrupted
by
another
member
of
the
household
and
stroll
up
to
the
manor
house
to
give
orders
for
the
reception
of
some
of
the
knight
family
or
go
into
alton
to
buy
some
necessary
household
article
occasionally
a
would
rattle
past
or
the
daily
coach
and
waggons
would
form
a
diversion
for
six
months
during
the
year
the
whole
of
the
godmersham
party
lived
at
chawton
while
their
other
house
was
being
repaired
and
painted
and
this
intercourse
added
greatly
to
jane
s
happiness
she
cemented
that
affectionate
friendship
with
her
eldest
niece
fanny
and
lord
brabourne
gives
little
extracts
from
his
mother
s
diary
to
show
how
close
the
companionship
was
between
the
two
aunt
jane
and
i
had
a
very
interesting
conversation
aunt
jane
and
i
had
a
very
delicious
morning
together
aunt
jane
and
i
walked
into
alton
together
and
so
on
but
during
these
years
there
was
no
abatement
of
the
fierce
turmoil
in
europe
the
peninsular
war
demanding
ever
fresh
levies
of
men
and
fresh
subsidies
of
money
was
a
continual
drain
on
england
s
resources
and
the
beginning
of
found
the
french
practically
masters
of
spain
but
in
that
year
the
tide
turned
and
after
continual
and
bloody
battles
and
sieges
in
which
the
loss
of
life
was
enormous
wellington
drove
the
french
back
across
the
pyrenees
and
in
the
following
year
planted
his
victorious
standard
actually
on
french
soil
but
the
effects
of
the
continuous
wars
were
being
felt
in
england
in
broke
out
the
luddite
riots
nominally
against
the
introduction
of
machinery
but
in
reality
because
of
the
high
price
of
bread
and
the
scarcity
of
employment
and
money
austria
had
signed
the
disastrous
peace
of
vienna
with
france
in
and
during
this
and
the
following
years
the
continent
with
small
exception
was
ground
beneath
the
heel
of
napoleon
who
in
commenced
the
invasion
of
russia
which
was
to
cost
him
so
dearly
in
there
is
rather
a
characteristic
exclamation
in
one
of
jane
s
letters
apropos
of
the
war
how
horrible
it
is
to
have
so
many
people
killed
and
what
a
blessing
that
one
cares
for
none
of
them
napoleon
s
tyranny
and
utter
regardlessness
of
the
feelings
of
national
pride
in
the
countries
he
had
conquered
now
began
to
bring
forth
for
him
a
bitter
harvest
the
sixth
coalition
of
nations
was
formed
against
him
including
russia
prussia
austria
great
britain
and
sweden
after
terrific
fighting
his
armies
were
forced
back
over
the
rhine
and
the
mighty
empire
he
had
formed
of
powerless
and
degraded
republics
melted
away
like
snow
in
an
august
sun
in
march
paris
itself
was
forced
to
surrender
to
the
triumphant
armies
of
the
allies
in
april
napoleon
signed
his
abdication
and
retired
to
elba
ever
since
he
first
appeared
as
an
active
agent
on
the
battlefields
of
europe
he
had
kept
the
continent
in
a
perpetual
ferment
cruelty
bloodshed
and
horror
had
followed
in
his
train
his
mighty
personality
had
seemed
scarcely
human
and
his
very
name
struck
terror
into
all
hearts
and
became
a
bugbear
with
which
to
frighten
children
we
have
two
letters
of
jane
s
in
the
early
part
of
march
written
from
london
where
she
was
staying
with
her
brother
henry
there
is
not
another
until
june
and
that
is
dated
from
chawton
of
course
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
any
intermediate
letters
she
wrote
can
have
been
entirely
free
from
allusion
to
the
great
news
at
which
the
whole
continent
burst
into
pæans
of
thankfulness
and
which
must
have
made
england
feel
as
if
she
had
awakened
from
a
nightmare
but
as
we
have
no
proof
either
way
it
must
be
left
open
to
doubt
in
the
june
letter
she
says
to
cassandra
who
was
in
london
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
not
be
trampled
to
death
in
running
after
the
emperor
the
report
in
alton
yesterday
was
that
they
would
certainly
travel
this
road
either
to
or
from
this
referred
to
the
visit
of
the
allied
monarchs
to
england
after
their
triumph
in
paris
and
the
emperor
was
the
emperor
alexander
of
russia
who
but
a
few
years
ago
had
formed
a
secret
treaty
with
napoleon
to
the
detriment
of
england
here
we
must
leave
political
matters
to
take
a
short
review
of
the
work
which
jane
had
produced
in
the
years
since
she
had
come
to
chawton
in
the
first
of
her
books
and
was
published
at
her
own
expense
and
produced
in
three
neat
little
volumes
in
clear
type
by
egerton
whitehall
her
identity
was
not
disclosed
by
the
which
simply
bore
the
words
by
a
she
paid
a
visit
to
her
brother
henry
in
london
in
order
to
arrange
the
details
with
which
henry
helped
her
very
much
when
in
london
with
this
object
she
writes
no
indeed
i
am
never
too
busy
to
think
of
and
i
can
no
more
forget
it
than
a
mother
can
forget
her
sucking
child
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
enquiries
i
have
had
two
sheets
to
correct
but
the
last
only
brings
us
to
willoughby
s
first
appearance
regrets
in
the
most
flattering
manner
that
she
must
wait
may
but
i
have
scarcely
a
hope
of
its
being
out
in
june
henry
does
not
neglect
it
he
hurried
the
printer
and
says
he
will
see
him
again
and
did
not
come
out
until
she
had
returned
to
the
country
and
when
she
received
for
it
later
on
she
thought
it
a
prodigious
recompense
for
that
which
had
cost
her
and
certainly
considering
her
anonymity
and
the
small
chances
the
book
had
she
had
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
the
gratifying
reception
of
and
seems
to
have
awakened
the
powers
of
writing
which
had
so
long
lain
dormant
from
want
of
encouragement
in
she
began
perhaps
in
some
ways
the
least
interesting
though
by
no
means
the
least
well
constructed
of
her
novels
edmund
and
fanny
are
both
a
little
too
mild
for
the
taste
of
most
people
and
are
far
from
taking
their
real
place
as
hero
and
heroine
however
edmund
s
blind
partiality
for
miss
crawford
is
very
natural
and
as
henry
austen
himself
said
it
is
certainly
impossible
to
tell
until
quite
the
end
how
the
story
is
going
to
be
finished
the
minor
characters
are
throughout
excellent
it
is
one
of
jane
s
shining
qualities
that
no
character
however
small
the
part
it
has
to
play
remains
unknown
she
seems
able
to
describe
in
a
touch
or
two
some
human
quality
or
defect
which
at
once
brings
us
into
intimate
relations
with
either
man
or
woman
rushworth
s
i
am
to
be
count
cassel
and
to
come
in
first
in
a
blue
dress
and
a
pink
satin
cloak
and
afterwards
have
another
fine
fancy
suit
by
way
of
a
shooting
dress
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
like
it
i
shall
hardly
know
myself
in
a
blue
dress
and
pink
satin
cloak
is
excellent
lady
bertram
s
character
might
be
gathered
from
one
sentence
in
the
letter
which
she
sends
to
fanny
telling
of
her
elder
son
s
dangerous
illness
edmund
kindly
proposes
attending
his
brother
immediately
but
i
am
happy
to
add
sir
thomas
will
not
leave
me
on
this
distressing
occasion
as
it
would
be
too
trying
for
norris
with
her
sycophantic
speeches
towards
her
nieces
her
own
opinion
of
her
virtues
her
admonitions
to
fanny
her
habit
of
taking
credit
for
the
generous
acts
performed
by
other
people
her
spunging
and
trick
of
getting
everything
at
the
expense
of
others
is
the
most
striking
figure
in
the
book
when
poor
fanny
having
been
neglected
and
left
alone
all
day
the
odd
one
of
the
party
is
returning
with
the
rest
rather
drearily
from
rushworth
park
norris
well
fanny
this
has
been
a
fine
day
for
you
upon
my
word
nothing
but
pleasure
from
beginning
to
end
i
am
sure
you
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
your
aunt
bertram
and
me
for
contriving
to
let
you
go
a
pretty
good
day
s
amusement
you
have
this
when
she
has
done
her
best
to
stop
fanny
s
going
at
all
depicts
her
character
in
unmistakable
colours
on
another
occasion
she
tells
the
meek
fanny
the
nonsense
and
folly
of
people
s
stepping
out
of
their
rank
and
trying
to
appear
above
themselves
makes
me
think
it
right
to
give
you
a
hint
fanny
now
that
you
are
going
into
company
without
any
of
us
and
i
do
beseech
and
entreat
you
not
to
be
putting
yourself
forward
and
talking
and
giving
your
opinion
as
if
you
were
one
of
your
cousins
as
if
you
were
dear
rushworth
or
julia
that
will
never
do
believe
me
remember
wherever
you
are
you
must
be
the
lowest
and
in
the
same
book
sir
thomas
bertram
s
conference
with
his
niece
on
the
proposals
he
has
received
for
her
from
crawford
is
a
wonderful
commentary
on
the
opinions
of
the
time
but
is
too
long
to
quote
in
entirety
that
fanny
should
refuse
a
handsome
eligible
young
man
merely
because
she
could
neither
respect
nor
love
him
was
quite
incredible
and
not
only
foolish
but
wicked
sir
thomas
speaks
sternly
of
his
disappointment
in
her
character
i
had
thought
you
peculiarly
free
from
wilfulness
of
temper
and
every
tendency
to
that
independence
of
spirit
which
prevails
so
much
in
modern
days
even
in
young
women
and
which
in
young
women
is
offensive
and
disgusting
beyond
all
common
we
know
what
jane
herself
thought
of
coercion
of
this
kind
and
how
fully
her
sentiments
were
on
the
side
of
liberty
of
choice
among
the
other
excellencies
of
we
may
note
the
sketch
of
fanny
s
home
at
portsmouth
with
her
father
and
noisy
brothers
so
distressing
to
her
excessive
sensitiveness
with
all
these
merits
and
to
add
to
them
that
of
excellent
construction
may
rank
high
in
spite
of
its
somewhat
colourless
hero
and
heroine
we
can
not
however
leave
edmund
and
fanny
in
the
same
certainty
of
a
happy
future
as
we
may
leave
others
of
the
heroes
and
heroines
in
the
novels
they
may
rub
along
well
enough
but
we
feel
they
can
not
but
be
intolerably
dull
though
perhaps
so
long
as
people
are
not
aware
of
their
own
dulness
they
may
enjoy
happiness
of
a
negative
sort
henry
austen
read
in
while
travelling
with
his
sister
and
she
notes
with
pleasure
henry
s
approbation
is
hitherto
even
equal
to
my
wishes
he
says
it
is
different
from
the
other
two
but
he
does
not
think
it
at
all
inferior
he
has
only
married
rushworth
i
am
afraid
he
has
gone
through
the
most
entertaining
part
he
took
to
lady
bertram
and
norris
most
kindly
and
gives
great
praise
to
the
drawing
of
all
the
characters
he
understands
them
all
likes
fanny
and
i
think
foresees
how
it
will
all
and

adds
later
henry
is
going
on
with
he
admires
crawford
i
mean
properly
as
a
clever
pleasant
man
i
tell
you
all
the
good
i
can
and
i
know
how
much
you
will
enjoy
henry
has
this
moment
said
he
likes
my
better
and
better
he
is
in
the
third
volume
i
believe
now
he
has
changed
his
mind
as
to
foreseeing
the
end
he
said
yesterday
at
least
he
defied
anybody
to
say
whether
would
be
reformed
or
forget
fanny
in
a
the
first
two
extracts
are
from
a
letter
given
in

came
the
publication
of
and
apparently
at
egerton

risk
this
was
evidently
jane
s
own
favourite
among
the
novels
and
her
references
to
it
are
made
with
genuine
delight
lady
robert
is
delighted
with
and
and
really
was
so
i
understand
before
she
knew
who
wrote
it

to

is
sure
he
shall
not
like

come
out
quite
in
the
beginning
of
the
year

a
letter

hope
you
received
my
little
parcel
by
j
bond
on
wednesday
evening
my
dear
cassandra
and
that
you
will
be
ready
to
hear
from
me
again
on
sunday
for
i
feel
that
i
must
write
to
you
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
got
my
own
darling
child
from
london
on
wednesday
i
received
one
copy
sent
down
by
falkner
with
three
lines
from
henry
to
say
that
he
had
given
another
to
charles

sent
a
third

my
stupidest
of
was
finished
in
the
same
year
and
came
out
under
the
auspices
of
egerton
in
though
the
second
edition
was
transferred
to
murray
before
the
publication
of
jane
had
begun
to
be
known
in
spite
of
the
anonymity
of
her
the
only
bit
of
public
recognition
she
ever
personally
received
was
accorded
to
her
while
she
was
in
london
and
must
be
told
in
the
account
of
her
london
experiences
chapter
xvi
in
london
during
the
years
when
she
lived
at
chawton
jane
stayed
pretty
frequently
in
london
generally
with
her
brother
henry
she
was
with
him
in
when
he
was
in
sloane
street
going
daily
to
the
bank
in
henrietta
street
covent
garden
in
which
he
was
a
partner
says
of
henry
austen
he
was
a
very
entertaining
companion
but
had
perhaps
less
steadiness
of
purpose
certainly
less
success
in
life
than
his
jane
was
evidently
very
fond
of
henry
and
fully
appreciated
his
ready
sympathy
and
interest
in
her
affairs
in
speaking
of
her
young
nephew
george
knight
she
says
george
s
enquiries
were
endless
and
his
eagerness
in
everything
reminds
me
often
of
his
uncle
henry
was
at
this
time
married
to
his
cousin
eliza
widow
of
the
count
de
feuillade
who
has
already
been
mentioned
and
eliza
was
evidently
vivacious
and
fond
of
society
so
her
had
by
no
means
a
dull
time
when
staying
with
her
but
how
different
were
jane
s
visits
to
london
unknown
and
certainly
without
any
idea
of
the
fame
that
was
to
attend
her
later
to
those
of
her
forerunners
and
contemporaries
who
had
been
discovered
and
who
on
the
very
slightest
grounds
were
fêted
and
adored
the
company
of
austen
s
friends
a
little
shopping
an
occasional
visit
to
the
play
these
were
the
details
which
filled
up
the
daily
routine
of
jane
s
visit
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
of
her
s
french
friends
and
enjoyed
a
large
musical
party
given
by
her
where
including
everybody
we
were
and
where
the
music
was
extremely
good
harp
pianoforte
and
singing
and
the
house
was
not
clear
till
it
is
not
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
london
that
she
knew
rocque
s
splendid
map
of
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
gives
us
a
basis
to
go
upon
though
houses
had
been
rapidly
built
since
it
was
made
even
at
rocque
s
date
london
reached
to
hyde
park
corner
and
the
district
we
call
mayfair
was
one
of
the
smartest
parts
of
the
town
george
s
hospital
stood
at
the
corner
as
at
present
and
a
line
of
houses
bordered
the
road
running
past
it
but
beyond
this
over
belgravia
were
open
fields
called
the
five
fields
crossed
by
the
rambling
westbourne
stream
and
traversed
by
paths
sloane
street
itself
had
been
planned
in
and
was
called
after
the
famous
sir
hans
sloane
whose
collection
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
british
museum
it
was
therefore
comparatively
new
in
jane
s
time
to
the
south
near
the
river
there
were
a
good
many
houses
at
chelsea
that
is
to
say
south
of
king
s
road
and
chelsea
hospital
of
course
stood
as
at
present
next
to
it
where
is
now
the
strip
of
garden
open
to
the
public
and
lined
by
bridge
road
stood
the
waste
site
and
ruins
of
the
famous
ranelagh
rotunda
which
had
been
in
its
time
the
scene
of
so
much
gaiety
only
a
few
years
previous
to
jane
s
visit
to
sloane
street
it
had
been
demolished
and
the
fittings
sold
vauxhall
however
the
great
rival
of
ranelagh
was
still
popular
and
continued
with
gradually
waning
patronage
until
after
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
does
not
appear
that
jane
ever
went
there
however
as
for
knightsbridge
if
we
imagine
all
the
great
modern
buildings
such
as
sloane
court
and
the
barracks
done
away
with
and
picture
a
long
unpaved
road
stretching
away
into
fields
and
open
country
westward
with
a
few
small
houses
of
the
brick
box
type
on
both
sides
we
get
some
idea
of
the
district
sloane
street
was
then
in
fact
quite
the
end
of
london
not
long
before
it
had
been
dangerous
to
travel
to
the
outlying
village
of
chelsea
without
protection
at
night
and
it
was
not
until
another
fourteen
years
had
passed
that
the
five
fields
were
laid
out
for
building
in
the
london
of
that
date
many
things
we
now
take
as
commonplace
necessaries
were
altogether
wanting
and
if
we
could
be
carried
back
in
time
it
would
be
the
negative
side
that
would
strike
us
most
for
instance
there
was
very
little
pavement
and
what
there
was
was
composed
of
great
rounded
stones
like
the
worst
sort
of
cobble
paving
in
a
provincial
town
most
of
the
roads
were
made
of
gravel
and
dirt
jane
mentions
a
fresh
load
of
gravel
having
been
thrown
down
near
hyde
park
corner
which
made
the
work
so
stiff
that
the
horses
refused
the
collar
and
grosley
tells
us
many
little
details
which
are
just
what
we
want
to
know
of
the
kind
which
in
all
ages
are
taken
for
granted
by
those
who
live
amid
them
so
that
they
need
a
stranger
to
record
them
he
gives
us
first
an
account
of
his
arrival
in
london
by
coach
over
westminster
bridge
i
arrived
in
london
towards
the
close
of
the
day
though
the
sun
was
still
above
the
horizon
the
lamps
were
already
lighted
upon
westminster
bridge
and
upon
the
roads
and
streets
that
lead
to
it
these
streets
are
broad
regular
and
lined
with
high
houses
forming
the
most
beautiful
quarter
of
london
the
river
covered
with
boats
of
different
sizes
the
bridge
and
the
streets
were
filled
with
coaches
their
broad
footpaths
crowded
with
the
group
of
buildings
on
the
west
of
the
bridge
belonged
of
course
to
the
old
palace
where
in
the
chapel
of
stephen
sat
the
house
of
commons
the
abbey
would
be
much
as
it
is
now
also
margaret
s
church
the
splendid
holbein
gate
standing
across
whitehall
had
been
removed
about
fifteen
years
before
grosley
s
visit
he
tells
us
that
means
however
have
been
found
to
pave
with
the
great
street
called
parliament
street
the
fine
street
called
pall
mall
is
already
paved
in
part
with
this
stone
and
they
have
also
begun
to
new
pave
the
strand
the
two
first
of
these
streets
were
dry
in
may
all
the
rest
of
the
town
being
still
covered
with
heaps
of
the
dirt
is
what
strikes
him
most
everywhere
in
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
strand
and
near
clement
s
church
i
have
seen
the
middle
of
the
street
constantly
foul
with
a
dirty
puddle
to
a
height
of
three
or
four
inches
a
puddle
where
splashings
cover
those
that
walk
on
foot
fill
coaches
when
their
windows
happen
not
to
be
up
and
bedaub
all
the
lower
parts
of
such
houses
as
are
exposed
to
it
the
english
are
not
afraid
of
this
dirt
being
defended
from
it
by
their
wigs
of
a
brownish
curling
hair
their
black
stockings
and
their
blue
surtouts
which
are
made
in
the
form
of
a
on
each
side
of
the
road
ran
a
kind
of
deep
and
dirty
ditch
called
the
kennel
into
which
refuse
and
rubbish
was
thrown
and
from
which
evil
and
unwholesome
odours
came
when
vehicles
in
passing
splashed
into
this
a
shower
of
filth
would
bespatter
the
behind
the
posts
therefore
it
was
of
no
small
consequence
to
keep
to
the
wall
and
the
giving
up
of
this
was
by
no
means
a
mere
matter
of
form
and
frequently
produced
quarrels
between
men
toward
the
end
of
the
century
however
swords
were
not
usually
worn
except
by
physicians
therefore
these
quarrels
were
not
always
productive
of
so
much
harm
as
they
might
have
been
the
streets
were
full
of
enormous
coaches
sometimes
gilt
hung
on
high
springs
drawn
by
four
and
even
six
horses
footmen
to
the
number
of
four
or
six
ran
beside
them
and
the
wheels
splashed
heavily
in
the
dirt
described
sending
up
the
mud
in
black
spurts
it
was
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
a
new
kind
of
paving
was
tried
blocks
of
covered
with
gravel
but
this
was
not
a
success
besides
the
large
coaches
there
were
hackney
coaches
which
would
seem
to
us
almost
equally
clumsy
and
unwieldy
omnibuses
were
not
seen
in
the
metropolis
until
but
there
was
something
of
the
kind
running
from
outlying
places
to
london
for
samuel
rogers
tells
a
story
as
follows
visiting
lady
one
day
i
made
inquiries
about
her
sister
she
is
now
staying
with
me
answered
lady
but
she
is
unwell
in
consequence
of
a
fright
which
she
got
on
her
way
from
richmond
to
on
enquiry
it
turned
out
that
while
miss
was
coming
to
town
the
footman
observing
an
omnibus
approach
and
thinking
she
might
like
to
see
it
suddenly
called
in
at
the
carriage
window
ma
am
the
omnibus
she
being
unacquainted
with
the
term
and
not
sure
but
an
omnibus
might
be
a
wild
beast
escaped
from
the
zoological
gardens
was
thrown
into
a
dreadful
state
of
agitation
by
the
announcement
and
this
caused
her
hackney
coaches
were
in
severe
competition
with
sedan
chairs
for
to
call
a
chair
was
as
frequent
a
custom
as
to
send
for
a
hackney
coach
the
chairmen
were
notorious
for
their
incivility
just
as
the
watermen
had
previously
been
and
as
their
successors
the
cabmen
became
later
though
now
the
reproach
is
removed
from
them
the
rudeness
of
chairmen
is
exemplified
in
for
when
tom
found
himself
after
the
masqued
ball
unable
to
produce
a
shilling
for
a
chair
he
walked
boldly
on
after
the
chair
in
which
his
lady
rode
pursued
by
a
grand
huzza
from
all
the
chairmen
present
who
wisely
take
the
best
care
they
can
to
discountenance
all
walking
afoot
by
their
betters
luckily
however
the
gentry
who
attend
at
the
opera
house
were
too
busy
to
quit
their
stations
and
as
the
lateness
of
the
hour
prevented
him
from
meeting
many
of
their
brethren
in
the
street
he
proceeded
without
molestation
in
a
dress
which
at
another
season
would
have
certainly
raised
a
mob
at
his
these
chairs
were
kept
privately
by
great
people
and
often
were
very
richly
decorated
with
brocade
and
plush
it
was
not
an
unusual
thing
for
the
footmen
or
chairmen
of
the
owner
to
be
decoyed
into
a
tavern
while
the
chair
was
stolen
for
the
sake
of
its
valuable
furniture
the
chairs
opened
with
a
lid
at
the
top
to
enable
the
occupant
to
stand
up
on
entrance
and
then
were
shut
down
in
the
caricatures
of
the
day
these
lids
are
represented
as
open
to
admit
of
the
lady
s
enormous
feather
being
left
on
her
head
it
was
of
course
quite
impossible
for
a
lady
to
go
about
alone
in
the
streets
of
london
at
this
date
and
even
dangerous
sometimes
for
men
the
porters
carriers
chairmen
drunken
sailors
ready
to
make
a
row
are
frequently
mentioned
by
grosley
and
scuffles
were
of
constant
occurrence
george
selwyn
in
was
so
mobbed
daubed
and
beset
by
a
crew
of
wretched
little
that
he
had
to
give
them
money
to
go
away
these
pests
were
under
no
sort
of
control
as
there
were
no
regular
police
in
the
streets
london
has
neither
troops
patrol
or
any
sort
of
regular
watch
and
it
is
guarded
during
the
night
only
by
old
men
chosen
from
the
dregs
of
the
people
who
have
no
other
arms
but
a
lanthorn
and
a
pole
who
patrole
the
streets
crying
the
hour
every
time
the
clock
strikes
who
proclaim
good
and
bad
weather
in
the
morning
who
come
to
awake
those
who
have
any
journey
to
perform
and
whom
it
is
customary
with
young
rakes
to
beat
and
use
ill
when
they
come
reeling
from
the
taverns
where
they
have
spent
the
grosley
it
is
bewildering
to
find
that
this
sort
of
thing
continued
until
george
the
fourth
s
reign
when
sir
robert
peel
s
metropolitan
police
act
was
passed
and
in
that
lawless
rowdy
age
one
wonders
how
the
town
ever
got
on
without
police
probably
there
were
numerous
deaths
from
violence
it
carries
us
back
almost
to
the
middle
ages
to
realise
that
so
late
as
the
last
execution
took
place
at
tyburn
samuel
rogers
recollected
as
a
boy
seeing
a
whole
cartful
of
young
girls
in
dresses
of
various
colours
on
their
way
to
execution
for
having
been
concerned
in
the
burning
of
a
house
in
the
gordon
riots
though
some
of
these
details
belong
to
an
age
prior
to
that
when
jane
stayed
in
london
yet
they
lingered
on
until
the
nineteenth
century
with
little
change
illustration
charing
cross
in
gas
was
just
beginning
to
be
used
in
lighting
the
streets
the
town
was
in
a
strange
transitional
state
pall
mall
was
first
lighted
with
a
row
of
in
and
on
the
king
s
birthday
june
the
wall
between
pall
mall
and
james
s
park
was
brilliantly
illuminated
in
the
same
way
but
gas
generally
was
not
placed
in
the
thoroughfares
until
or
and
meantime
requiring
much
care
and
attention
were
the
only
resource
it
was
a
noisy
rattling
busy
dirty
london
then
as
much
distinguished
for
its
fogs
as
it
is
at
present
grosley
was
much
struck
with
the
fogs
we
may
add
to
the
inconvenience
of
the
dirt
the
which
being
mixed
with
a
constant
fog
covers
london
and
wraps
it
up
entirely
on
the
of
april
james
s
park
was
incessantly
covered
with
fogs
smoke
and
rain
that
scarce
left
a
possibility
of
distinguishing
objects
at
the
distance
of
four
he
speaks
at
another
place
this
smoke
being
loaded
with
terrestrial
particles
and
rolling
in
a
thick
heavy
atmosphere
forms
a
cloud
which
envelopes
london
like
a
mantle
a
cloud
which
the
sun
pervades
but
rarely
a
cloud
which
recoiling
back
upon
itself
suffers
the
sun
to
break
out
only
now
and
then
which
casual
appearance
procures
the
londoners
a
few
of
what
they
call
glorious
in
regard
to
the
main
streets
and
squares
in
the
west
end
the
greatest
difference
noticeable
between
the
london
of
and
of
the
present
time
would
be
the
network
of
dirty
and
mean
buildings
the
part
where
is
now
trafalgar
square
in
the
middle
of
these
stood
the
king
s
mews
which
had
been
rebuilt
in
and
was
not
done
away
with
until
at
the
corner
where
northumberland
avenue
joins
charing
cross
was
the
splendid
mansion
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
which
remained
until
another
great
difference
lay
in
the
fact
of
there
being
no
regent
street
for
this
street
was
not
begun
until
two
years
after
jane
s
visit
bond
street
was
there
and
piccadilly
and
across
the
entrance
to
the
park
where
is
now
the
duke
of
york
s
column
was
carlton
house
the
home
of
the
obstreperous
prince
of
wales
in
grosley
s
time
leicester
house
in
leicester
fields
was
still
standing
but
in
it
had
been
pulled
down
grosley
lodged
near
here
and
his
details
as
to
rent
are
interesting
he
says
that
the
house
of
his
landlord
was
small
only
three
storeys
high
standing
on
an
irregular
patch
of
ground
and
rented
at
guineas
a
year
with
an
additional
guinea
for
the
water
supply
which
was
distributed
three
times
weekly
in
this
house
two
or
three
little
rooms
on
the
first
storey
very
slightly
furnished
were
let
to
him
at
a
guinea
a
week
the
touch
about
the
water
supply
points
to
another
deficiency
all
the
present
admirable
system
of
private
taps
and
other
distributing
agencies
also
the
network
of
drains
sewers
had
yet
to
be
evolved
for
sanitation
was
in
a
very
elementary
condition
many
of
the
shops
were
still
distinguished
by
signs
for
though
the
custom
of
numbering
in
place
of
signs
had
been
introduced
it
had
made
way
but
slowly
thus
we
find
jane
referring
to
the
tallow
chandler
is
penlington
at
the
crown
and
beehive
charles
street
covent
it
would
be
particularly
pleasant
to
know
where
she
did
her
own
shopping
in
which
she
was
femininely
interested
but
it
is
difficult
to
infer
but
beyond
the
fact
that
layton
and
shears
was
evidently
the
draper
whom
she
patronised
and
that
layton
and
shears
is
bedford
house
and
that
fanny
bought
her
irish
at
newton
s
in
leicester
square
we
do
not
get
much
detail
but
we
glean
a
few
particulars
from
this
visit
and
one
of
a
later
date
grafton
house
was
evidently
a
famous
place
for
shopping
for
she
and
fanny
frequently
paid
visits
there
before
breakfast
which
was
however
generally
much
later
than
we
have
it
perhaps
about
ten
jane
says
we
must
have
been
three
quarters
of
an
hour
at
grafton
house
edward
sitting
by
all
the
time
with
wonderful
patience
there
fanny
bought
the
net
for
anna
s
gown
and
a
beautiful
square
veil
for
herself
the
edging
there
is
very
cheap
i
was
tempted
by
some
and
i
bought
some
very
nice
plaiting
lace
at
three
and
again
she
says
we
set
off
immediately
after
breakfast
and
must
have
reached
grafton
house
by
half
past
eleven
but
when
we
entered
the
shop
the
whole
counter
was
thronged
and
we
waited
full
half
an
hour
before
we
could
be
attended
fanny
was
much
pleased
with
the
stockings
she
bought
of
remmington
silk
at
twelve
shillings
cotton
at
four
shillings
and
threepence
she
thinks
them
great
bargains
but
i
have
not
seen
them
yet
as
my
hair
was
dressing
when
the
man
and
the
stockings
it
was
quite
the
fashion
at
that
time
to
patronise
wedgwood
whose
beautiful
china
was
much
in
vogue
the
original
founder
of
the
firm
had
died
in
and
had
been
succeeded
by
his
son
we
then
went
to
wedgwood
s
where
my
brother
and
fanny
chose
a
dinner
set
i
believe
the
pattern
is
a
small
lozenge
in
purple
between
lines
of
narrow
gold
and
it
is
to
have
the
this
identical
dinner
set
is
still
in
the
possession
of
the
family
lybbe
powys
also
mentions
wedgwood
in
the
morning
we
went
to
london
and
at
wedgwood
s
as
usual
were
highly
entertained
as
i
think
no
shop
affords
so
great
a
in
the
spring
of
jane
was
again
in
london
and
visited
many
picture
galleries
the
fact
of
having
fanny
with
her
was
enough
to
enhance
greatly
her
pleasure
in
these
sights
henry
austen
had
died
in
the
early
part
of
this
year
leaving
no
children
henry
of
course
eventually
married
again
as
did
all
the
brothers
with
the
exception
of
edward
knight
but
it
was
not
for
seven
years
his
second
wife
was
eleanor
daughter
of
henry
jackson
the
house
in
sloane
street
was
given
up
after
his
wife
s
death
and
he
went
to
henrietta
street
to
be
near
the
bank
it
was
here
jane
came
to
him
a
collection
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
paintings
was
being
exhibited
in
pall
mall
though
the
great
painter
himself
was
dead
with
her
head
full
of
and
which
had
recently
been
published
jane
looks
in
vain
to
discover
any
portrait
that
will
do
for
elizabeth
bennet
and
failing
to
find
one
she
writes
playfully
i
can
only
imagine
that
darcy
prizes
any
picture
of
her
too
much
to
like
it
should
be
exposed
to
the
public
eye
i
can
imagine
he
would
have
that
sort
of
mixture
of
love
pride
and
she
however
is
more
successful
in
finding
one
of
jane
bingley
elizabeth
s
sister
mrs
bingley
s
is
exactly
shaped
face
features
and
sweetness
there
never
was
a
greater
likeness
she
is
dressed
in
a
white
gown
with
green
ornaments
which
convinces
me
of
what
i
had
always
supposed
that
green
was
a
favourite
colour
with
kensington
gardens
were
at
that
time
the
resort
of
many
of
the
fashionable
jane
mentions
frequently
walking
there
though
we
doubt
if
she
were
attracted
by
the
scenes
of
struggle
and
confusion
that
sometimes
took
place
from
of
march
we
learn
the
access
to
kensington
gardens
is
so
inconvenient
to
the
visitors
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
politeness
of
those
who
have
the
direction
of
it
will
induce
them
to
give
orders
for
another
door
to
be
made
for
the
convenience
of
the
public
one
door
for
admission
and
another
for
departure
would
prove
a
great
convenience
to
the
visitors
for
want
of
this
regulation
the
ladies
frequently
have
their
clothes
torn
to
pieces
and
are
much
hurt
by
the
crowd
passing
different
two
ladies
were
lucky
enough
to
escape
through
the
gate
of
kensington
gardens
on
sunday
last
with
only
a
broken
arm
each
when
a
few
lives
have
been
lost
perchance
then
a
door
or
two
may
be
made
for
the
convenience
of
the
families
of
the
this
shows
that
there
was
a
wall
or

would
be
well
to
restore
when
one
realises
the
crowds
that
habitually
frequented
the
place
it
seems
as
if
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
the
record
that
a
man
was
accidentally
shot
in
when
the
keepers
were
hunting
foxes

kensington
gardens
the

made

mere
wilderness

the

of
george

were
only
open
to
the
public
on
saturdays

when
the
court
ceased
to
reside
at

they
were
open
during
the
spring
and
summer
the
broad

seems
to
have
been
the
most
fashionable
promenade

doubtless
there
was
frequently
to
be
seen
here
some
such
crowd
as
that
described
by
tickell
when
each
walk
with
robes
of
various
dyes
bespread

from
afar

went
several
times
to
the
theatre

to
covent

and
drury

which
were
then
considered
far
the
best

there
were
many
others
existing

were

had
been
opened

also
applies
to
the

must
also
be
enumerated
the
italian

stood
where
his

down

enlarged

five
years

it
was
burnt

the

remained

fearful
riot
broke
out
on
the
first
night
of
the

the
mob
would
hear
no

listen
to
no
reason
the
members
who
banded
themselves
together
adopted
the

would
not
allow
the

to
proceed
making
an
indescribable
din
with
whistles
and
shrieks

weeks
of
dispute
a
compromise
was
arrived
at
the
higher

retained
in
the
case
of

illustration
the
little
theatre
haymarket
at
an
earlier
date
some
of
the
audience
had
actually
been
seated
on
the
stage
among
the
performers
and
there
were
still
in
jane
s
time
boxes
on
the
stage
but
outside
the
curtain
we
can
see
this
in
the
illustration
of

the

comes
right
up

footlights

being
no
stalls
and
the
patrons
of
the
pit
are
seated
on
backless
benches
not
divided
into
compartments
we
gather
from
contemporary
literature
that
it
was
a
common
thing
to
go
to
rehearsals
of
the
performances
at
the
opera
and
that
there
was
a
attached
which
formed
at
least
as
great
an
attraction
to
the
idle
rich
who
loved
to
chatter
sweet
nothings

the
piece
itself
kemble
was
the
brother
of
siddons
and
did
as
much
as
any
man
for
the
improvement
of
the
stage
when
he
first
began
his
career
he
was
struck
by
the
ludicrous
conventionality
of
the
dresses
which
were
as
much
a
matter
of
form
as
the
custom
of
representing
statues
of
living
men
in
roman
he
and
the
great
garrick
killed
this
foolish
custom
the
conventionalism
in
matters
of
dress
upon
the
stage
is
noticed
by
the
ubiquitous
grosley
on
the
stage
the
principal
actresses
drag
long
trains
after
them
and
are
followed
by
a
little
boy
in
quality
of
a
who
is
as
inseparable
from
them
as
the
shadow
from
the
body
this

keeps
his
eye
constantly
upon
the
train
of
the
princess
sets
it
to
rights
when
it
is
ever
so
little
ruffled
or
disordered
and
is
seen
to
run
after
it
with
all
his
might
when
a
violent
emotion
makes
the
princess

theatre
has
an
older
record
than
covent
garden
it
dates
from
and
in
was
the
only
theatre
in
london
being
considered
sufficient
for
the
joint
representations
of
the
two
old
established
companies
of
players
the
king
s
and
the
duke
s
it
was
many
times
rebuilt
being
more
than
once
destroyed
by
fire
in
fact
nothing
is
more
striking
in
the
annals
of
theatres
than
the
astonishing
number
of
times
nearly
every
theatre
has
been
burnt
down
the
third
house
was
burnt
in
february
and
its
successor
opened
in
with
a
prologue
by
lord
byron
during
jane
austen
s
first
recorded
visit
to
london
therefore
it
would
be
in
course
of
rebuilding
though
on
subsequent
visits
it
would
be
very
fashionable
being
new
just
as
in
novels
during
the
lifetime
of
jane
austen
there
was
an
enormous
change
from
the
grandiloquent
and
conventional
to
the
natural
and
simple
and
the
same
in
poetry
so
it
was
on
the
stage
the
absurd
conventionalism
the
unsuitable
dresses
no
matter
what
so
long
as
they
were
grand
were
exchanged
for
easy
declamation
and
natural
attitude
garrick
as
we
have
said
was
one
of
the
first
actors
to
begin
this
movement
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
won
the
applause
of
london
and
that
crowds
came
to
hear
him
so
that
in
when
he
was
to
act
hamlet
servants
were
sent
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
to
keep
places
for
their
employers
for
there
were
then
no
such
things
as
reserved
seats
fine
actors
and
actresses
abounded
in
the
eighteenth
century
siddons
who
was
born
in
did
not
give
her
farewell
performance
in
lady
macbeth
until
and
lived
long
after
both
oldfield
and
peg
woffington
however
had
passed
away
before
jane
s
time
illustration
the
rev
george
crabbe
it
was
an
age
when
people
were
wild
about
acting
and
private
theatres
were
a
common
hobby
many
a
young
spark
ruined
himself
in
this
extravagance
and
of
mentions
that
there
were
no
fewer
than
six
private
theatres
in
london
and
westminster
the
plays
commented
upon
in
jane
s
letters
seem
to
us
very
dull
fanny
and
the
two
little
girls
are
gone
to
take
places
for
at
covent
garden
and
the
latter
will
be
a
fine
show
for
l
izzie
and
m
arianne
they
revelled
last
night
in
whom
we
left
in
hell
at
half
past
eleven
we
had
scaramouch
and
a
ghost
and
were
delighted
i
speak
of
them
my
delight
was
very
tranquil
and
the
rest
of
us
were
sober
minded
was
the
last
of
three
musical
things
hours
at
in
three
acts
and
the
rather
less
flat
and
we
had
good
places
in
the
box
next
the
stage
box
i
was
particularly
disappointed
at
seeing
nothing
of
crabbe
i
felt
sure
of
him
when
i
saw
the
boxes
were
fitted
up
with
crimson
velvet
the
new
terry
was
lord
ogleby
and
henry
thinks
he
may
do
but
there
was
no
acting
more
than
in
the
following
year
her
comments
are
we
went
to
the
play
again
last
night
the
s
is
a
musical
thing
in
three
acts
and
as
edward
was
steady
in
not
staying
for
anything
more
we
were
home
before
ten
fanny
and
are
delighted
with
miss
all
that
i
am
sensible
of
is
a
pleasing
person
and
no
skill
in
acting
we
had
mathews
liston
and
enery
of
course
some
prepare
for
a
play
the
very
first
evening
i
rather
think
covent
garden
to
see
young
in
miss
was
probably
miss
stephens
a
singer
who
made
her
debut
in
in
concerts
and
appeared
on
the
stage
at
covent
garden
in
she
afterwards
became
countess
of
essex
she
was
considered
unsurpassed
for
her
rendering
of
jane
mentions
her
we
are
to
see
the
to
i
expect
to
be
very
much
amused
excepting
miss
stephens
i
daresay
will
be
very
the
mathews
she
mentions
was
charles
mathews
senior
liston
was
at
first
master
of
martin
s
grammar
school
leicester
square
but
became
a
popular
actor
and
at
the
time
of
her
writing
was
appearing
at
covent
garden
but
by
far
the
best
actor
she
records
having
seen
is
kean
we
were
quite
satisfied
with
kean
i
can
not
imagine
better
acting
but
the
part
was
too
short
and
excepting
him
and
miss
smith
she
did
not
quite
answer
my
expectation
parts
were
and
the
play
heavy
we
were
too
much
tired
for
the
whole
of
which
has
three
acts
there
is
a
great
deal
of
finery
and
dancing
in
it
but
i
think
little
merit
elliston
was
nourjahad
but
i
think
it
is
a
solemn
sort
of
part
not
at
all
calculated
for
his
powers
there
was
nothing
of
the
best
elliston
about
him
i
might
not
have
known
him
but
for
his
voice
and
later
i
shall
like
to
see
kean
again
excessively
and
to
see
him
with
you
too
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
there
were
no
fault
in
him
anywhere
and
in
his
scene
with
tubal
there
was
exquisite
in
another
place
she
says
that
so
great
was
the
rage
for
seeing
kean
that
only
a
third
or
fourth
row
could
be
got
and
that
he
is
more
admired
than
this
is
very
different
from
miss
mitford
s
account
of
her
first
impressions
of
the
great
actor
well
i
went
to
see
kean
and
was
thoroughly
disgusted
this
monarch
of
the
stage
is
a
little
insignificant
man
slightly
deformed
strongly
ungraceful
seldom
pleasing
the
eye
still
seldomer
satisfying
the
a
voice
between
grunting
and
croaking
a
perpetual
hoarseness
which
suffocates
his
words
and
a
vulgarity
of
manner
which
his
admirers
are
pleased
to
call
nature
his
acting
will
always
be
if
not
actually
insupportable
yet
unequal
disappointing
and
destructive
of
all
but
as
in
her
account
of
darcy
and
elizabeth
we
have
seen
that
miss
mitford
preferred
the
stereotyped
and
conventional
to
the
natural
of
which
jane
austen
was
so
ardent
an
admirer
therefore
we
can
not
feel
much
surprise
at
the
difference
between
the
two
opinions
jane
evidently
enjoyed
good
acting
but
was
critical
and
not
a
great
lover
of
the
drama
unless
it
was
very
well
done
this
we
might
expect
for
naturalness
was
her
admiration
and
naturalness
she
would
only
find
in
performers
such
as
kean
chapter
xvii
fanny
and
anna
the
nephews
and
nieces
at
godmersham
were
rapidly
growing
into
men
and
women
edward
and
george
on
leaving
winchester
went
to
oxford
the
luxurious
way
in
which
they
were
brought
up
evidently
sometimes
annoyed
their
aunt
who
was
accustomed
to
see
the
younger
generation
more
repressed
she
says
of
as
i
wrote
of
my
nephews
with
a
little
bitterness
in
my
last
i
think
it
particularly
incumbent
on
me
to
do
them
justice
now
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
saying
they
were
both
at
the
sacrament
yesterday
now
these
two
boys
who
are
out
with
the
foxhounds
will
come
home
and
disgust
me
again
by
some
habit
of
luxury
or
some
proof
of
sporting
while
jane
was
at
godmersham
in
her
brother
charles
his
wife
and
little
daughters
were
there
too
it
was
the
custom
not
an
invariable
one
but
a
matter
of
a
captain
in
the
navy
to
take
his
wife
and
children
voyaging
with
him
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
captain
wentworth
says
he
hates
to
hear
of
women
on
board
and
croft
whose
husband
is
an
admiral
declares
women
may
be
as
comfortable
on
board
as
in
the
best
house
in
england
i
believe
i
have
lived
as
much
on
board
as
most
women
and
i
know
nothing
superior
to
the
accommodation
of
a
charles
austen
s
wife
and
children
seem
to
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
on
board
with
him
and
cassy
the
eldest
girl
a
delicate
quiet
child
suffered
from
seasickness
during
rough
weather
jane
says
affectionately
of
her
poor
little
love
i
wish
she
were
not
so
very
palmery
but
it
seems
stronger
than
ever
i
never
knew
a
wife
s
family
features
have
such
undue
cassy
was
not
quite
happy
among
her
cousins
they
are
too
many
and
too
boisterous
for
jane
speaks
of
her
and
her
mother
as
being
their
own
nice
selves
fanny
looking
as
neat
and
white
this
morning
as
possible
and
charles
all
affectionate
placid
quiet
cheerful
good
alas
in
september
of
the
following
year
charles
austen
died
in
childbirth
her
husband
who
was
a
very
domestic
man
felt
the
loss
severely
subsequently
he
married
her
sister
harriet
and
became
the
father
of
two
boys
in
addition
to
his
little
daughters
in
edward
knight
was
annoyed
by
a
claimant
to
the
chawton
estate
and
it
appears
from
what
miss
mitford
says
on
the
subject
in
her
letters
that
this
was
in
consequence
of
old
knight
s
not
having
fulfilled
some
technical
point
in
connection
with
the
property
as
chawton
was
worth
about
a
year
the
matter
was
serious
and
that
it
was
not
altogether
a
fancy
originating
in
the
mind
of
the
claimant
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
after
protracted
discussions
edward
knight
did
in
pay
him
a
sum
of
money
to
settle
the
matter
we
have
no
letters
of
jane
s
before
november
but
she
was
probably
at
home
at
chawton
with
her
sister
and
mother
when
the
news
that
napoleon
had
escaped
from
elba
burst
upon
the
world
like
a
the
call
to
arms
rang
throughout
europe
and
then
followed
the
terrible
hundred
days
which
ended
on
june
the
eighteenth
with
the
battle
of
waterloo
alison
in
his
of
the
history
of
says
no
one
who
was
of
an
age
to
understand
what
was
going
on
can
ever
forget
the
entrancing
joy
which
thrilled
through
the
british
heart
at
the
news
of
waterloo
the
thanks
of
parliament
were
voted
to
wellington
and
his
army
a
medal
struck
by
government
was
given
to
every
officer
and
soldier
who
had
borne
arms
on
that
eventful
day
and
not
less
than
was
raised
by
voluntary
subscriptions
for
those
wounded
in
the
fight
and
the
widows
and
orphans
of
the
we
wonder
if
the
household
at
chawton
contributed
its
mite
among
the
rest
jane
s
heart
surely
must
have
thrilled
in
unison
with
those
of
her
countrymen
louis
xviii
was
once
more
placed
on
the
throne
of
his
fathers
and
napoleon
was
sent
to
helena
he
arrived
there
on
november
the
sixteenth
and
by
that
date
jane
was
again
in
london
nursing
her
brother
henry
between
and
many
charming
letters
passed
between
jane
and
her
young
niece
fanny
and
as
these
contain
more
of
the
personal
element
than
any
of
the
others
that
have
been
preserved
they
are
among
the
most
interesting
of
all
at
the
beginning
of
these
letters
fanny
was
which
in
those
days
was
considered
quite
a
staid
age
for
an
unmarried
girl
in
one
of
her
letters
she
tells
her
aunt
that
her
feelings
had
cooled
towards
someone
who
at
one
time
she
had
thought
of
marrying
jane
s
answer
is
full
of
sense
and
sympathy
and
gives
us
much
insight
into
her
own
views
on
the
relations
of
the
sexes
what
strange
creatures
we
are
she
writes
it
seems
as
if
your
being
secure
of
him
had
made
you
indifferent
there
was
a
little
disgust
i
suspect
at
the
races
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
his
expressions
then
would
not
do
for
one
who
had
rather
more
acuteness
penetration
and
taste
than
love
which
was
your
case
and
yet
after
all
i
surprised
that
the
change
in
the
feelings
should
be
so
great
he
is
just
what
he
ever
was
only
more
evidently
and
uniformly
devoted
to
oh
dear
fanny
your
mistake
has
been
one
that
thousands
of
women
fall
into
he
was
the
young
man
who
attached
himself
to
you
that
was
the
charm
and
most
powerful
it
is
upon
the
whole
what
is
to
be
done
you
have
no
inclination
for
any
other
person
his
situation
in
life
family
friends
and
above
all
his
character
his
uncommonly
amiable
mind
strict
principles
just
notions
good
habits
that
know
so
well
how
to
value
that
is
really
of
the
first
importance
pleads
his
cause
most
strongly
you
have
no
doubt
of
his
having
superior
abilities
he
has
proved
it
at
the
university
he
is
i
dare
say
such
a
scholar
as
your
agreeable
idle
brothers
would
ill
bear
a
comparison
with
the
more
i
write
about
him
the
more
strongly
i
feel
the
desirableness
of
your
growing
in
love
with
him
again
there
such
beings
in
the
world
perhaps
one
in
a
thousand
as
the
creature
you
and
i
should
think
perfection
where
grace
and
spirit
are
united
to
worth
where
the
manners
are
equal
to
the
heart
and
understanding
but
such
a
person
may
not
come
in
your
way
or
if
he
does
he
may
not
be
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
of
fortune
the
near
relation
of
your
own
particular
friend
and
belonging
to
your
own
country
and
now
my
dear
fanny
having
written
so
much
on
one
side
of
the
question
i
shall
turn
round
and
entreat
you
not
to
commit
yourself
farther
and
not
to
think
of
accepting
him
unless
you
really
do
like
him
anything
is
to
be
preferred
or
endured
rather
than
marrying
without
affection
and
if
his
deficiencies
of
manner
strike
you
more
than
all
his
good
qualities
if
you
continue
to
think
strongly
of
them
give
him
up
at
once
when
i
consider
how
few
young
men
you
have
yet
seen
much
of
how
capable
you
are
of
being
really
in
love
and
how
full
of
temptation
the
next
six
or
seven
years
of
your
life
will
probably
be
i
can
not
wish
you
with
your
present
very
cool
feelings
to
devote
yourself
in
honour
to
him
it
is
very
true
that
you
never
may
attach
another
man
his
equal
altogether
but
if
that
other
man
has
the
power
of
attaching
you
he
will
be
in
your
eyes
the
most
perfect
you
are
inimitable
irresistible
you
are
the
delight
of
my
life
such
letters
such
entertaining
letters
as
you
have
lately
sent
such
a
description
of
your
queer
little
heart
such
a
lovely
display
of
what
imagination
does
you
are
so
odd
and
all
the
time
so
perfectly
natural
so
peculiar
in
yourself
and
yet
so
like
everybody
else
it
is
very
very
gratifying
to
me
to
know
you
so
intimately
oh
what
a
loss
it
will
be
when
you
are
married
you
are
too
agreeable
in
your
single
state
i
shall
hate
you
when
your
delicious
play
of
mind
is
all
settled
down
into
conjugal
and
maternal
affections
and
yet
i
do
wish
you
to
marry
very
much
because
i
know
you
will
never
be
happy
till
you
are
and
later
on
apropos
of
someone
else
she
adds
single
women
have
a
dreadful
propensity
for
being
poor
which
is
one
very
strong
argument
in
favour
of
matrimony
but
i
need
not
dwell
on
such
arguments
with
you
pretty
dear
to
you
i
shall
say
as
i
have
often
said
before
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
the
right
man
will
come
at
last
you
will
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
or
three
years
meet
with
somebody
more
generally
unexceptionable
than
anyone
you
have
yet
known
who
will
love
you
as
warmly
as
possible
and
who
will
so
completely
attract
you
that
you
will
feel
you
never
really
loved
but
it
was
not
until
that
fanny
married
as
his
second
wife
the
rt
hon
sir
edward
knatchbull
who
had
already
five
sons
and
one
daughter
the
eldest
boy
being
twelve
years
old
six
years
after
the
marriage
the
daughter
married
fanny
s
brother
edward
she
herself
lived
to
nearly
ninety
and
was
the
mother
of
five
sons
and
four
daughters
and
in
her
eldest
son
was
created
baron
brabourne
and
he
as
has
been
already
stated
was
the
editor
of
the
volumes
of
but
jane
s
sympathetic
advice
was
called
for
by
more
than
one
niece
passing
through
the
difficult
time
between
girlhood
and
womanhood
anna
her
eldest
brother
james
s
daughter
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
chawton
and
though
she
does
not
seem
ever
to
have
taken
quite
the
same
position
in
her
aunt
s
affections
as
fanny
did
she
was
yet
a
lively
amusing
pleasant
girl
she
had
evidently
determined
to
follow
in
her
aunt
s
footsteps
as
was
most
natural
and
had
attempted
to
write
a
novel
herself
jane
s
treatment
of
her
tentative
efforts
was
very
kind
some
of
the
letters
to
the
authoress
are
preserved
and
nothing
could
be
gentler
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
sending
me
your
ms
it
has
entertained
me
extremely
indeed
all
of
us
i
read
it
aloud
to
your
grandmamma
and
aunt
cass
and
we
were
all
very
pleased
the
spirit
does
not
drop
at
all
now
we
have
finished
the
second
book
or
rather
the
fifth
susan
is
a
nice
animated
little
creature
but
julian
is
the
delight
of
our
lives
he
is
quite
interesting
the
whole
of
his
break
off
with
lady
helena
is
very
well
she
then
goes
in
great
detail
into
all
the
characters
making
various
suggestions
you
are
but
now
coming
to
the
heart
and
beauty
of
your
story
until
the
heroine
grows
up
the
fun
must
be
imperfect
but
i
expect
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
from
the
next
three
or
four
books
and
i
hope
you
will
not
resent
these
remarks
by
sending
me
no
then
she
gives
one
or
two
characteristic
touches
devereux
forester
s
being
ruined
by
his
vanity
is
extremely
good
but
i
wish
you
would
not
let
him
plunge
into
a
vortex
of
i
do
not
object
to
the
thing
but
can
not
bear
the
expression
it
is
such
thorough
novel
slang
and
so
old
that
i
daresay
adam
met
with
it
in
the
first
novel
he
in
anna
was
engaged
to
benjamin
lefroy
whom
she
married
in
november
after
her
marriage
she
first
lived
at
hendon
but
in
the
following
year
she
and
her
husband
took
a
small
house
near
alton
so
that
she
was
within
a
walk
of
chawton
she
still
went
on
with
her
and
jane
continued
to
criticise
her
we
have
no
great
right
to
wonder
at
his
benjamin
lefroy
s
not
valuing
the
name
of
progillian
that
is
a
source
of
delight
which
even
can
hardly
be
quite
competent
st
julian
s
history
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
you
had
not
very
long
known
it
yourself
i
suspect
his
having
been
in
love
with
the
aunt
gives
cecilia
an
additional
interest
with
him
i
like
the
idea
a
very
proper
compliment
to
an
aunt
i
rather
imagine
indeed
that
nieces
are
seldom
chosen
but
out
of
compliment
to
some
aunt
or
other
i
daresay
ben
was
in
love
with
me
once
and
would
never
have
thought
of
you
if
he
had
not
supposed
me
dead
of
scarlet
anna
became
the
mother
of
six
daughters
and
one
son
and
lived
until
chapter
xviii
the
prince
regent
and
in
october
henry
austen
was
dangerously
ill
he
had
by
this
time
moved
into
another
house
which
was
in
hans
place
quite
near
his
former
residence
in
sloane
street
though
the
connection
with
the
bank
in
henrietta
street
was
still
kept
up
both
his
sisters
were
with
him
at
first
and
an
express
was
sent
for
his
brother
edward
so
critical
was
his
state
considered
to
be
but
he
rallied
and
afterwards
when
he
was
out
of
danger
edward
and
cassandra
went
on
to
chawton
and
jane
was
left
to
nurse
him
back
to
complete
health
the
ideas
of
medicine
at
that
time
were
primitive
and
consisted
chiefly
of
unmitigated
an
extraordinary
custom
which
must
have
been
responsible
for
many
a
weak
body
s
giving
up
the
ghost
this
incredible
system
is
exemplified
in
the
following
anecdote
when
lybbe
powys
son
philip
had
a
coach
accident
she
comments
on
his
treatment
thus
he
has
not
since
the
accident
tasted
a
bit
of
meat
or
drunk
a
drop
of
wine
had
a
perpetual
blister
ever
since
and
blooded
every
three
or
four
days
for
many
well
may
the
editor
of
the
book
remark
truly
powys
enduring
this
treatment
was
a
survival
of
the
fittest
there
was
then
a
wide
distinction
between
the
physician
and
the
apothecary
which
may
be
noticed
in
jane
s
playful
repudiation
you
seem
to
be
under
a
mistake
as
to
you
call
him
an
apothecary
he
is
no
apothecary
he
has
never
been
an
apothecary
there
is
not
an
apothecary
in
the
only
inconvenience
of
the
situation
so
it
is
we
have
not
a
medical
man
within
reach
he
is
a
haden
nothing
but
a
haden
a
sort
of
wonderful
nondescript
creature
on
two
legs
something
between
a
man
and
an
angel
but
without
the
least
spice
of
an
apothecary
he
is
perhaps
the
only
person
not
an
apothecary
as
it
happened
this
nursing
of
her
brother
brought
her
into
public
notice
for
the
physician
who
attended
henry
austen
was
also
a
physician
of
the
prince
regent
s
at
that
time
though
jane
s
name
had
not
appeared
on
the
of
her
books
there
was
no
longer
any
secret
as
to
the
writer
s
identity
and
the
doctor
told
her
one
day
that
the
prince
of
wales
who
had
been
made
regent
in
was
a
great
admirer
of
her
novels
this
is
the
only
good
thing
one
ever
heard
of
george
and
one
can
not
help
doubting
the
fact
it
is
hard
to
imagine
his
reading
any
book
however
delightful
the
physician
however
added
that
the
prince
read
the
novels
often
and
kept
a
set
in
every
one
of
his
residences
further
he
himself
had
told
the
prince
that
the
author
was
in
london
and
he
had
desired
his
librarian
to
wait
upon
her
the
librarian
clarke
duly
came
and
jane
was
invited
to
go
to
carlton
house
but
it
does
not
seem
that
the
prince
himself
deigned
to
bestow
any
personal
notice
upon
her
or
that
he
even
saw
her
she
saw
clarke
and
clarke
alone
and
therefore
one
begins
to
feel
tolerably
sure
that
it
was
from
clarke
the
whole
thing
originated
this
worthy
man
deserves
some
credit
but
that
he
was
lacking
in
any
sense
of
humour
or
knowledge
of
life
was
evidenced
by
his
ponderous
suggestions
as
to
future
books
one
of
which
was
that
jane
should
delineate
in
some
future
work
the
habits
of
life
character
and
enthusiasm
of
a
clergyman
who
should
pass
his
time
between
the
metropolis
and
the
country
who
should
be
something
like
beattie
s
minstrel
and
when
this
was
rejected
an
historical
romance
illustrative
of
the
august
house
of
cobourg
would
just
now
be
very
jane
s
reply
is
full
of
good
sense
and
excellently
expressed
you
are
very
kind
in
your
hints
as
to
the
sort
of
composition
which
might
recommend
me
at
present
and
i
am
fully
sensible
that
an
historical
romance
founded
on
the
house
of
cobourg
might
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
of
profit
or
popularity
than
such
pictures
of
domestic
life
in
country
villages
as
i
deal
in
but
i
could
no
more
write
a
romance
than
an
epic
poem
i
could
not
sit
seriously
down
to
write
a
serious
romance
under
any
other
motive
than
to
save
my
life
and
if
it
were
indispensable
for
me
to
keep
it
up
and
never
relax
into
laughing
at
myself
or
at
other
people
i
am
sure
i
should
be
hung
before
i
had
finished
the
first
chapter
i
must
keep
to
my
own
style
and
go
on
in
my
own
way
and
though
i
may
never
succeed
again
in
that
i
am
convinced
that
i
should
totally
fail
in
any
s
she
however
gladly
agreed
to
dedicate
her
next
work
to
his
royal
highness
the
next
work
was
then
nearly
ready
for
publication
murray
was
the
publisher
and
the
dedication
which
had
been
graciously
accepted
appeared
on
the
illustration
the
garden
of
carlton
house
the
state
of
the
court
at
that
time
is
abundantly
pictured
in
numerous
memoirs
diaries
journals
not
the
least
among
which
is
that
of
miss
burney
jane
s
contemporary
and
sister
authoress
george
iii
had
one
very
striking
in
his
time
and
position
and
especially
in
his
seems
to
have
lived
a
good
domestic
life
he
had
been
married
young
to
a
princess
who
had
no
beauty
to
recommend
her
and
his
first
feelings
on
seeing
her
had
been
those
of
disappointment
but
being
a
sensible
kindly
man
he
had
soon
learnt
to
value
the
good
heart
and
nature
of
the
girl
who
had
come
so
far
to
marry
a
man
she
had
never
seen
their
numerous
family
linked
them
together
and
though
the
sons
were
a
constant
source
of
trouble
and
notorious
in
their
wild
lives
the
tribe
of
princesses
seem
to
have
endeared
themselves
to
everyone
by
their
gracious
manners
poor
old
george
himself
with
his
what
what
what
and
his
homely
ways
could
never
offend
intentionally
and
the
sweet
queen
as
miss
burney
so
fulsomely
calls
her
though
fully
conscious
of
her
own
dignity
and
not
disposed
to
make
a
fuss
about
the
hardships
inseparable
from
the
position
of
her
was
yet
at
the
bottom
too
as
for
most
of
the
princes
however
their
ways
were
a
byword
and
scandal
in
every
contemporary
book
we
read
of
their
being
drunk
and
otherwise
disgracing
themselves
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
duke
of
york
were
the
worst
and
the
dukes
of
clarence
and
kent
seem
to
have
been
the
best
at
brighton
where
the
prince
of
wales
had
established
his
pavilion
orgies
of
drink
and
coarseness
went
on
that
disgusted
even
those
accustomed
to
very
free
manners
the
princes
appeared
in
public
with
their
mistresses
and
reeled
into
public
the
prince
s
treatment
of
his
own
wife
is
well
known
purely
from
caprice
and
without
a
shadow
of
justification
she
the
mother
of
his
only
child
princess
charlotte
was
dismissed
from
her
home
and
forbidden
any
of
the
privileges
or
respect
due
to
her
rank
a
course
of
treatment
which
made
england
despised
among
the
nations
of
the
other
two
we
read
the
duke
of
kent
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
steady
looking
of
the
princes
perhaps
he
may
be
heavy
but
he
has
unquestionably
the
most
of
a
man
of
business
in
his
and
horace
walpole
my
neighbour
the
duke
of
clarence
is
so
popular
that
if
richmond
were
a
borough
and
he
had
not
attained
his
title
but
still
retained
his
idea
of
standing
candidate
he
would
certainly
be
elected
there
he
pays
his
bills
regularly
himself
locks
up
his
doors
at
night
that
his
servants
may
not
stay
out
late
and
never
drinks
but
a
few
glasses
of
wine
though
the
value
of
crowns
is
mightily
fallen
of
late
at
market
it
looks
as
if
his
royal
highness
thought
they
were
still
worth
waiting
for
nay
it
is
said
that
he
tells
his
brothers
that
he
shall
be
king
before
either
this
is
fair
at
he
was
afterwards
william
iv
the
prince
of
wales
mixed
freely
in
political
intrigues
of
the
worst
kind
and
took
part
in
faction
politics
as
a
man
he
was
a
contemptible
creature
without
character
or
intellect
but
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
he
had
a
certain
number
of
admirers
because
as
a
young
man
he
was
graceful
and
obliging
in
manners
and
personal
graciousness
in
a
sovereign
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
it
is
incongruous
that
a
pure
sweet
story
such
as
should
have
been
dedicated
to
a
man
whose
faults
and
vices
were
such
as
the
author
could
never
have
conceived
but
the
dedication
probably
served
the
purpose
of
advertising
this
the
last
novel
that
jane
herself
was
to
see
issued
to
the
public
ranks
very
high
indeed
among
the
novels
but
it
relies
for
its
position
on
a
different
sort
of
excellence
from
that
which
distinguishes
and
there
is
in
it
as
we
might
have
expected
more
finished
workmanship
and
less
of
the
brilliancy
of
youth
the
book
is
not
so
lively
as
and
and
its
somewhat
slow
opening
unlike
jane
s
usual
style
is
enough
to
discourage
some
readers
who
expect
to
be
plunged
into
a
scene
such
as
that
which
begins
her
first
novel
or
which
comes
very
soon
in
and
has
however
more
plot
than
is
usual
with
jane
austen
s
writings
it
is
more
deliberately
constructed
and
yet
the
whole
scene
takes
place
in
a
quiet
country
village
without
once
changing
the
heroine
emma
whose
domestic
importance
as
the
only
unmarried
daughter
of
a
wealthy
widower
has
given
her
a
full
idea
of
her
own
value
has
developed
her
individuality
very
strongly
she
is
not
spoilt
but
all
her
words
and
actions
betoken
one
accustomed
to
impress
her
will
on
her
surroundings
in
a
way
not
often
allowed
to
unmarried
girls
at
home
the
motif
is
her
propensity
which
again
and
again
brings
her
to
grief
this
affords
opening
for
many
of
the
humorous
touches
in
which
the
author
delights
the
book
is
very
rich
in
secondary
characters
the
garrulous
miss
bates
with
her
rattling
tongue
is
one
of
the
strongly
individualised
comic
characters
which
jane
generally
manages
to
insert
she
ranks
with
collins
with
norris
and
the
lesser
specimens
of
the
same
gallery
allen
and
jennings
she
is
admirably
true
to
life
just
such
a
garrulous
tiresome
creature
as
many
a
governess
of
the
old
school
has
degenerated
into
in
the
evening
of
her
life
emma
s
father
the
valetudinarian
woodhouse
has
been
said
to
be
overdrawn
but
the
great
merit
of
jane
s
work
is
that
she
does
not
exaggerate
traits
to
be
found
in
people
that
any
of
us
might
number
among
our
acquaintance
are
so
skilfully
depicted
as
to
appear
prominent
she
selects
true
if
extreme
types
and
does
not
draw
monstrosities
such
as
those
in
which
dickens
s
books
abound
and
of
which
one
can
only
say
they
have
existed
once
at
one
time
but
are
as
rare
as
the
exhibits
in
a
dime
museum
woodhouse
s
married
daughter
knightley
is
excellently
done
her
sympathy
with
her
father
s
tastes
is
only
kept
in
check
by
her
affection
for
husband
and
children
which
forces
her
to
attend
to
them
and
forget
herself
yet
the
enjoyment
with
which
she
sips
her
gruel
when
allowed
to
have
it
is
real
enjoyment
and
she
would
have
certainly
lived
on
gruel
too
had
she
been
an
old
maid
the
hero
knightley
is
one
of
the
few
sensible
men
among
jane
s
heroes
and
he
with
his
experience
and
strength
of
character
is
as
has
been
said
elsewhere
the
only
true
mate
for
emma
knightley
has
been
criticised
as
a
prig
but
he
is
far
from
that
he
was
a
stern
elderly
man
apparently
at
least
in
age
though
we
are
told
he
was
only
thirty
emma
herself
has
more
ability
than
her
rival
elizabeth
bennet
in
and
her
mind
has
more
depth
and
application
we
could
imagine
emma
reading
and
studying
whereas
pleasant
as
elizabeth
might
have
been
as
a
companion
her
forte
was
general
intelligent
interest
not
depth
and
we
could
not
picture
her
deeply
absorbed
in
any
book
but
a
novel
emma
was
one
of
jane
s
own
favourite
heroines
and
she
said
of
her
i
am
going
to
draw
a
heroine
whom
no
one
but
myself
will
much
it
is
true
that
for
the
generality
of
men
emma
would
in
real
life
have
been
just
a
little
too
strong
but
she
is
none
the
less
interesting
to
read
about
elton
has
already
been
commented
on
in
the
chapter
on
clergymen
a
more
perfect
match
than
he
and
his
vulgar
flashy
wife
would
be
difficult
to
find
as
for
jane
s
traits
of
character
in
regard
to
the
hero
and
his
brother
her
genius
can
not
be
better
expressed
than
in
the
words
of
herries
pollock
who
calls
it
the
finely
touched
likeness
and
unlikeness
between
the
brothers
knightley
at
every
turn
of
phrase
at
every
step
so
to
speak
one
knows
which
is
the
better
man
and
yet
the
point
is
never
pressed
by
the
though
on
the
whole
the
book
has
less
than
and
it
is
rich
in
observation
and
quiet
humour
it
was
published
by
murray
in
december
jane
says
of
my
greatest
anxiety
at
present
is
that
this
fourth
work
should
not
disgrace
what
was
good
in
the
others
but
on
this
point
i
will
do
myself
the
justice
to
declare
that
whatever
may
be
my
wishes
for
its
success
i
am
strongly
haunted
with
the
idea
that
to
those
readers
who
have
preferred
and
it
will
appear
inferior
in
wit
and
to
those
who
have
preferred
inferior
in
good
s
a
reviewer
in
of
the
autumn
includes
with
other
works
of
the
same
writer
it
has
been
supposed
therefore
that
the
proof
sheets
must
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
reviewer
before
the
work
was
actually
issued
by
application
to
murray
cleared
up
the
difficulty
for
he
ascertained
that
owing
to
exceptional
delays
the
number
of
the
review
bearing
date
october
did
not
in
reality
come
out
until
march
and
that
therefore
had
actually
appeared
before
its
production
the
reviewer
was
sir
walter
scott
as
is
stated
by
lockhart
in
a
note
to
the
who
adds
that
and
were
in
particular
great
favourites
of
scott
s
in
his
summary
at
the
end
of
the
article
sir
walter
scott
the
author
s
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
peculiar
tact
with
which
she
presents
characters
that
the
reader
can
not
fail
to
recognise
reminds
us
something
of
the
merits
of
the
flemish
school
of
painting
the
subjects
are
not
often
elegant
and
certainly
never
grand
but
they
are
finished
up
to
nature
and
with
a
precision
which
delights
the
the
faults
on
the
contrary
arise
from
the
minute
detail
which
the
author
s
plan
comprehends
characters
of
folly
or
simplicity
such
as
those
of
old
woodhouse
and
miss
bates
are
ridiculous
when
first
presented
but
if
too
often
brought
forward
or
too
long
dwelt
upon
their
prosing
is
apt
to
become
as
tiresome
in
fiction
as
in
real
in
this
we
can
not
agree
to
accuse
jane
of
it
is
to
accuse
her
of
lacking
the
very
gift
in
which
she
was
the
merit
of
her
bores
is
that
they
never
bore
but
are
only
amusing
she
never
proses
and
her
few
paragraphs
of
quotation
from
the
sayings
of
miss
bates
set
that
lady
before
us
as
clearly
or
more
clearly
than
if
fifty
pages
from
the
actual
life
had
been
given
by
the
phonograph
from
what
jane
says
she
apparently
saw
this
article
in
march
when
she
was
back
at
chawton
for
she
writes
the
authoress
of
has
no
reason
i
think
to
complain
of
her
treatment
in
it
except
in
the
total
omission
of
i
can
not
but
be
sorry
that
so
clever
a
man
as
the
reviewer
of
should
consider
it
as
unworthy
of
being
that
jane
was
satisfied
with
her
treatment
by
murray
may
be
seen
by
her
handing
over
to
him
the
conduct
of
the
second
edition
of
she
writes
in
one
place
i
had
a
most
civil
note
in
reply
from
murray
he
is
so
very
polite
indeed
that
it
is
quite
at
this
time
she
must
have
begun
the
last
and
shortest
of
her
books
which
she
finished
in
august
of
the
same
year
and
with
this
we
enter
on
the
last
phase
the
gradual
decline
and
sinking
of
the
bright
spirit
which
had
added
so
greatly
to
the
happiness
of
thousands
it
had
never
known
chapter
xix
last
days
the
evening
of
jane
s
life
had
set
in
but
yet
it
had
not
occurred
even
to
those
who
loved
her
best
that
they
must
inevitably
lose
her
she
was
in
her
year
recognition
from
the
public
had
just
begun
to
be
accorded
to
her
in
the
novels
she
had
lately
written
no
sign
of
decay
could
be
detected
it
is
true
that
in
both
and
there
is
a
particular
maturity
of
rendering
and
a
kindlier
tone
that
marks
perhaps
a
difference
but
not
degeneracy
if
the
word
seriousness
can
ever
be
used
of
such
brilliant
work
as
hers
we
might
say
that
a
certain
sweet
seriousness
pervaded
these
two
which
are
more
alike
in
tone
than
any
of
the
other
novels
has
been
called
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
novels
it
has
many
excellencies
not
the
least
among
which
is
the
character
of
the
heroine
whose
girlish
weakness
develops
into
a
loyal
steadfastness
she
has
also
that
endearingness
that
perhaps
certain
others
of
the
heroines
lack
in
fact
of
all
the
principal
female
characters
that
of
anne
elliot
has
most
of
that
nameless
and
indefinable
charm
which
comes
from
a
combination
of
qualities
such
as
firmness
gentleness
unselfishness
sympathy
and
sweetness
a
charm
which
is
more
lovable
than
any
number
of
stereotyped
graces
though
anne
was
at
one
time
weak
we
feel
that
she
outgrows
it
that
it
was
the
weakness
of
immaturity
not
of
character
and
that
her
loyalty
fully
redeems
it
jane
herself
says
of
anne
elliot
you
may
perhaps
like
the
heroine
as
she
is
almost
too
good
for
me
yet
the
note
seems
less
obtrusive
with
anne
than
with
fanny
price
whose
exceeding
surface
meekness
does
sometimes
produce
a
little
exasperation
anne
and
fanny
have
the
most
in
common
among
the
heroines
of
the
novels
yet
what
a
difference
is
there
fanny
has
many
virtues
but
her
intense
nervous
sensitiveness
makes
one
feel
her
and
underlying
all
her
shrinking
there
was
a
quality
of
obstinacy
that
is
felt
without
being
insisted
upon
it
is
just
the
subtle
difference
that
jane
knew
so
well
how
to
make
the
feeling
perhaps
is
that
fanny
is
not
quite
a
gentlewoman
that
she
would
be
difficult
to
get
on
with
however
meek
and
on
the
surface
while
anne
could
never
be
anything
but
a
delightful
companion
incidentally
some
parts
of
have
already
been
referred
to
louisa
musgrove
s
fall
on
the
cobb
the
scenes
that
take
place
in
bath
the
touching
words
of
anne
when
she
feels
that
she
has
hopelessly
lost
her
lover
which
strike
a
deeper
note
of
feeling
than
any
other
in
the
whole
range
of
the
novels
it
remains
therefore
but
to
say
that
there
is
no
secondary
character
to
equal
those
of
miss
bates
or
collins
that
the
secondary
characters
are
in
all
cases
less
sharply
defined
than
those
usually
depicted
by
jane
but
that
captain
wentworth
is
equal
to
his
good
fortune
and
that
as
a
pair
of
lovers
he
and
anne
stand
unrivalled
was
finished
in
july
but
jane
was
not
satisfied
with
it
perhaps
her
own
failing
health
and
the
sense
of
tiredness
that
went
with
it
had
made
her
lose
that
grip
of
the
action
that
she
had
hitherto
held
so
well
she
felt
the
story
did
not
end
satisfactorily
that
it
wanted
bringing
together
and
clinching
so
to
speak
says
this
weighed
upon
her
mind
the
more
so
probably
on
account
of
her
weak
state
of
health
so
that
one
night
she
retired
to
rest
in
very
low
spirits
but
such
depression
was
little
in
accordance
with
her
nature
and
was
soon
shaken
off
the
next
morning
she
woke
to
more
cheerful
views
and
brighter
inspirations
the
sense
of
power
revived
and
imagination
resumed
its
course
she
cancelled
the
condemned
chapter
and
wrote
two
others
entirely
different
in
its
these
were
the
tenth
and
eleventh
chapters
and
contained
the
scene
in
which
anne
so
touchingly
expresses
her
ideas
on
the
theme
of
woman
s
love
there
is
no
question
that
the
story
as
it
now
stands
is
improved
by
the
change
and
that
her
instinct
was
true
gives
the
cancelled
chapter
in
his
and
it
certainly
is
tame
and
flat
compared
with
the
others
and
had
she
not
made
the
substitution
it
might
justly
have
been
said
that
however
charming
did
show
signs
of
failing
power
this
book
was
not
published
until
after
her
death
when
it
appeared
in
one
volume
with
the
first
to
which
her
name
was
prefixed
this
came
out
in
with
a
memoir
by
her
brother
henry
up
to
the
time
of
her
death
she
had
received
nearly
seven
hundred
pounds
for
the
published
books
which
considering
her
anonymity
and
entire
lack
of
publicity
and
influence
must
have
appeared
to
her
and
indeed
was
wonderful
though
in
comparison
with
the
true
value
of
the
work
very
little
indeed
in
december
her
brothers
henry
and
charles
were
both
at
chawton
and
she
speaks
of
their
being
in
good
health
and
spirits
she
got
through
the
winter
well
and
wrote
to
a
friend
in
january
such
mild
weather
is
you
know
delightful
to
us
and
though
we
have
a
great
many
ponds
and
a
fine
running
stream
through
the
meadows
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
it
is
nothing
but
what
beautifies
us
and
does
to
talk
of
i
have
certainly
gained
strength
through
the
winter
and
am
not
far
from
being
well
and
i
think
i
understand
my
own
case
now
so
much
better
than
i
did
as
to
be
able
by
care
to
keep
off
any
serious
return
of
she
had
taken
to
using
a
in
good
weather
and
doubtless
this
was
a
great
boon
though
she
was
able
to
walk
one
way
either
to
or
from
alton
without
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
manage
both
ways
when
the
summer
came
in
january
also
she
mentions
that
her
brother
henry
who
was
now
ordained
was
coming
down
to
preach
it
will
be
a
nervous
hour
for
our
pew
though
we
hear
that
he
acquits
himself
with
as
much
ease
and
collectedness
as
if
he
had
been
used
to
it
all
his
her
last
completed
book
was
not
her
last
work
even
in
declining
strength
the
motive
power
was
unabated
upon
a
fitful
revival
of
her
strength
at
the
beginning
of
she
fell
eagerly
to
work
at
a
story
of
which
she
wrote
twelve
chapters
it
has
no
name
and
the
plot
and
purpose
are
undeveloped
but
some
of
the
personages
sketched
have
more
than
promise
there
is
a
parker
with
fixed
theories
as
to
the
fashionable
watering
place
he
hopes
to
evolve
out
of
a
sussex
fishing
village
there
is
a
rich
and
vulgar
lady
denham
who
will
certainly
disappoint
her
relatives
by
the
testamentary
disposition
of
her
property
and
there
are
two
maiden
ladies
who
thoroughly
enjoy
bad
health
and
quack
themselves
to
their
heart
s
content
whatever
the
plot
to
be
unravelled
there
is
no
sign
that
the
writer
s
hand
had
lost
its
austin
dobson
s
preface
to
macmillan
s
edition
of
we
are
told
by
that
the
date
on
the
last
chapter
of
this
was
march
which
as
the
watch
of
a
drowned
man
denotes
the
time
of
his
death
so
does
this
final
date
seem
to
fix
the
period
when
her
mind
could
no
longer
pursue
its
accustomed
it
was
in
march
that
her
own
family
began
to
think
seriously
of
the
malady
that
was
so
insidiously
making
inroads
on
her
vitality
her
niece
caroline
anna
s
and
sister
of
the
to
whose
the
world
is
so
much
indebted
was
then
a
child
of
twelve
she
came
about
the
end
of
march
to
stay
at
chawton
but
found
her
aunt
so
ill
that
she
could
not
be
taken
in
so
she
was
sent
on
to
her
anna
lefroy
in
her
private
records
she
gives
the
following
account
from
recollection
the
next
day
we
walked
over
to
chawton
to
make
enquiries
after
our
aunt
she
was
then
keeping
her
room
but
said
she
would
see
us
and
we
went
up
to
her
she
was
in
her
and
was
sitting
quite
like
an
invalid
in
an
but
she
got
up
and
kindly
greeted
us
and
then
pointing
to
seats
which
had
been
arranged
for
us
by
the
fire
there
is
a
chair
for
the
married
lady
and
a
little
stool
for
you
i
was
struck
by
the
alteration
in
herself
she
was
very
pale
her
voice
was
weak
and
low
and
there
was
about
her
a
general
appearance
of
debility
and
suffering
but
i
have
been
told
that
she
never
had
much
acute
pain
she
was
not
equal
to
the
exertion
of
talking
to
us
and
our
visit
to
the
sick
room
was
a
very
short
one
aunt
cassandra
soon
taking
us
away
i
do
not
suppose
we
stayed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
never
saw
aunt
jane
it
was
in
may
that
jane
was
persuaded
to
go
with
her
sister
to
lodgings
in
winchester
for
the
sake
of
further
medical
advice
and
she
never
returned
to
chawton
though
probably
that
was
the
last
thought
that
would
have
occurred
to
her
on
leaving
it
for
she
was
never
inclined
to
be
analytical
or
valetudinarian
and
certainly
she
was
one
of
the
last
to
affect
illness
or
become
an
invalid
for
fancy
cassandra
can
not
have
known
how
soon
she
was
to
be
bereaved
of
that
dear
sister
whose
life
had
run
in
such
harmony
with
her
own
and
though
anxiety
must
have
darkened
her
heart
jane
s
own
sanguineness
would
buoy
her
with
fresh
hope
and
the
weeks
the
sisters
passed
together
in
winchester
must
have
been
singularly
peaceful
the
house
in
which
jane
stayed
still
stands
it
is
in
college
street
close
to
the
great
archway
that
marks
the
entrance
to
the
college
precincts
she
says
of
it
herself
our
lodgings
are
very
comfortable
we
have
a
neat
little
with
a
bow
window
overlooking
gabell
s
here
her
life
and
strength
slowly
ebbed
away
day
by
day
she
was
longer
chained
to
her
sofa
from
increasing
weakness
the
elementary
medical
knowledge
of
her
day
was
powerless
to
help
her
though
her
life
humanly
speaking
could
probably
have
been
prolonged
if
medical
science
had
then
known
what
it
knows
now
day
by
day
through
the
bow
window
overlooking
the
street
would
come
the
sound
of
boyish
voices
the
clatter
of
boyish
feet
and
she
could
see
the
greenery
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
beyond
the
wall
she
had
plenty
of
companionship
cassandra
was
ever
with
her
and
james
austen
helped
in
the
nursing
the
slight
sharpness
arising
from
unusual
penetration
which
had
sometimes
marked
jane
s
comments
in
earlier
days
had
all
died
down
she
said
gratefully
to
her
you
have
always
been
a
kind
sister
to
me
mary
and
of
her
own
dear
cassandra
she
said
i
will
only
say
further
that
my
dearest
sister
my
tender
watchful
indefatigable
nurse
has
not
been
made
ill
by
her
exertions
as
to
what
i
owe
her
and
the
anxious
affection
of
all
my
beloved
family
on
this
occasion
i
can
only
cry
over
it
and
pray
god
to
bless
them
more
and
and
on
july
when
all
the
trees
were
at
their
greenest
and
the
bright
sunshine
lighted
up
the
walls
of
the
hoary
abbey
she
passed
away
we
can
add
nothing
to
her
sister
s
account
written
in
the
agony
of
the
first
bereavement
to
her
who
was
now
closest
to
her
heart
her
niece
fanny
knight
my
dearest
fanny
dear
to
me
now
for
her
dear
sake
whom
we
have
lost
she
did
love
you
most
sincerely
since
tuesday
evening
when
her
complaint
returned
there
was
a
visible
change
she
slept
more
and
much
more
comfortably
indeed
during
the
last
eight
and
forty
hours
she
was
more
asleep
than
awake
her
looks
altered
and
she
fell
away
but
i
perceived
no
material
diminution
of
strength
and
though
i
was
then
hopeless
of
her
recovery
i
had
no
suspicion
how
rapidly
my
loss
was
approaching
i
have
lost
a
treasure
such
a
sister
such
a
friend
as
never
can
have
been
surpassed
she
was
the
sun
of
my
life
the
gilder
of
every
pleasure
the
soother
of
every
sorrow
i
had
not
a
thought
concealed
from
her
and
it
is
as
if
i
had
lost
a
part
of
myself
she
felt
herself
to
be
dying
about
half
an
hour
before
she
became
tranquil
and
apparently
unconscious
during
that
half
hour
was
her
struggle
poor
soul
she
said
she
could
not
tell
us
what
she
suffered
though
she
complained
of
little
fixed
pain
when
i
asked
her
if
there
was
anything
she
wanted
her
answer
was
she
wanted
nothing
but
death
and
some
of
her
words
were
god
grant
me
patience
pray
for
me
oh
pray
for
me
her
voice
was
affected
but
as
long
as
she
spoke
she
was
intelligible
i
hope
i
do
not
break
your
heart
my
dearest
fanny
by
these
particulars
i
mean
to
afford
you
gratification
while
i
am
relieving
my
own
feelings
i
could
not
write
so
to
anybody
else
on
thursday
when
the
clock
struck
six
she
was
talking
quietly
to
me
i
can
not
say
how
soon
afterwards
she
was
seized
again
with
faintness
which
was
followed
by
the
sufferings
which
she
could
not
describe
but
lyford
who
had
been
sent
for
had
applied
something
to
give
her
ease
and
she
was
in
a
state
of
quiet
insensibility
by
seven
o
clock
at
the
latest
from
that
time
till
half
past
four
when
she
ceased
to
breathe
she
scarcely
moved
a
limb
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
think
with
gratitude
to
the
almighty
that
her
sufferings
were
over
a
slight
motion
of
the
head
with
every
breath
remained
till
almost
the
last
i
sat
close
to
her
with
a
pillow
in
my
lap
to
assist
in
supporting
her
head
which
was
almost
off
the
bed
for
six
hours
fatigue
made
me
then
resign
my
place
to
j
for
two
hours
and
a
half
when
i
took
it
again
and
in
about
an
hour
more
she
breathed
her
last
there
was
nothing
convulsed
which
gave
the
idea
of
pain
in
her
look
on
the
contrary
but
for
the
continual
motion
of
the
head
she
gave
one
the
idea
of
a
beautiful
statue
and
even
now
in
her
coffin
there
is
such
a
sweet
serene
air
over
her
countenance
as
is
quite
pleasant
to
and
later
on
after
the
funeral
she
wrote
again
thursday
was
not
so
dreadful
a
day
to
me
as
you
imagined
everything
was
conducted
with
the
greatest
tranquillity
and
but
that
i
was
determined
that
i
would
see
the
last
and
therefore
was
upon
the
listen
i
should
not
have
known
when
they
left
the
house
i
watched
the
little
mournful
procession
the
length
of
the
street
and
when
it
turned
from
my
sight
and
i
had
lost
her
for
ever
even
then
i
was
not
nor
so
much
agitated
as
i
am
now
in
writing
of
it
never
was
a
human
being
more
sincerely
mourned
by
those
who
attended
her
remains
than
was
this
dear
creature
may
the
sorrow
with
which
she
is
parted
with
on
earth
be
a
prognostic
of
the
joy
with
which
she
is
hailed
in
heaven
oh
if
i
may
one
day
be
reunited
to
her
there
cassandra
herself
survived
for
years
and
spent
her
last
days
in
the
cottage
at
chawton
endeared
to
her
by
recollections
of
her
mother
and
beloved
sister
jane
s
in
the
cathedral
is
almost
opposite
the
tomb
of
the
founder
william
of
wykeham
a
large
black
slab
of
marble
let
into
the
pavement
marks
the
spot
it
bears
an
inscription
including
the
following
words
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
the
sweetness
of
her
temper
and
the
extraordinary
endowments
of
her
mind
obtained
the
regard
of
all
who
knew
her
and
the
warmest
love
of
her
immediate
subsequently
her
nephew
inserted
a
brass
on
the
wall
near
with
an
inscription
which
runs
as
follows
jane
austen
known
to
many
by
her
writing
endeared
to
her
family
by
the
varied
charms
of
her
character
and
ennobled
by
christian
faith
and
piety
was
born
at
steventon
in
the
county
of
hampshire
and
buried
in
this
cathedral
july
she
openeth
her
mouth
with
wisdom
and
in
her
tongue
is
the
law
of
in
a
memorial
window
was
inserted
as
the
result
of
a
public
subscription
it
was
designed
and
executed
by
kemp
in
the
head
of
the
window
is
a
figure
of
augustine
whose
name
in
its
abbreviated
form
is
austin
in
the
centre
of
the
upper
row
of
lights
is
david
with
his
harp
below
his
figure
in
latin
are
the
words
remember
in
the
lord
jane
austen
who
died
july
in
the
centre
of
the
bottom
row
is
the
figure
of
john
and
the
remaining
figures
are
those
of
the
sons
of
korah
carrying
scrolls
with
sentences
in
latin
indicative
of
the
religious
side
of
jane
austen
s
character
namely
come
ye
children
hearken
unto
me
i
will
teach
you
the
fear
of
the
them
that
are
meek
shall
he
guide
in
judgement
and
such
as
are
gentle
them
shall
he
teach
his
my
mouth
shall
speak
of
wisdom
and
my
heart
shall
muse
on
my
mouth
shall
daily
speak
of
thy
righteousness
and
thy
that
jane
was
so
deeply
and
dearly
loved
by
her
own
people
speaks
much
for
her
worth
she
and
cassandra
especially
cassandra
were
very
reticent
in
their
expression
of
feeling
but
seldom
has
heart
been
knit
to
heart
as
were
theirs
the
love
of
sisters
has
not
often
formed
the
theme
of
song
or
romance
we
hear
of
a
mother
s
love
for
her
son
of
a
brother
for
a
brother
but
the
love
of
sisters
is
when
it
exists
in
perfection
as
strong
as
these
as
pure
in
its
spring
and
more
full
of
feeling
sisters
whose
hearts
are
open
to
one
another
who
have
shared
the
same
experiences
look
on
the
world
from
a
similar
standpoint
and
the
breaking
of
such
ties
is
severe
agony
at
only
jane
had
passed
away
still
in
the
highest
maturity
of
her
powers
leaving
behind
her
but
six
completed
books
all
short
but
each
one
perfect
in
itself
this
is
what
will
be
said
of
did
what
she
attempted
to
do
perfectly
the
books
are
all
instinct
with
the
same
qualities
the
precision
of
word
and
phrase
the
genius
for
knowing
what
to
select
and
what
to
leave
unsaid
but
not
one
is
a
repetition
of
another
in
the
whole
gallery
of
characters
each
one
is
distinct
she
was
a
real
artist
her
work
lay
apart
from
and
outside
of
herself
we
do
not
find
a
picture
of
herself
under
different
names
playing
heroine
in
different
sets
of
circumstances
each
heroine
stands
by
herself
and
in
her
women
s
portraits
she
reaches
her
bennet
emma
woodhouse
fanny
price
anne
elliot
catherine
morland
elinor
dashwood
we
know
each
one
as
a
friend
and
each
one
is
completely
differentiated
so
brilliant
so
perfect
so
stamped
with
its
own
individuality
is
each
of
the
books
that
one
wonders
what
she
could
possibly
have
produced
next
to
take
rank
with
its
forerunners
within
so
small
a
compass
with
such
a
narrow
stage
on
which
to
set
the
how
did
she
manage
to
make
so
great
a
variety
it
is
in
keeping
with
her
character
and
work
that
there
should
be
no
decline
no
falling
off
that
all
should
be
good
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
novels
are
preferred
by
one
some
by
another
some
are
stronger
in
one
point
some
in
another
but
neither
decay
nor
improvement
can
justly
be
found
between
first
and
last
this
is
genius
genius
can
not
grow
nor
can
it
be
cultivated
it
is
there
and
its
work
is
done
without
effort
and
without
labour
if
jane
had
not
died
at
so
early
an
age
her
life
would
not
have
seemed
so
complete
so
rounded
as
it
did
her
dying
in
the
full
plenitude
and
maturity
of
power
is
in
keeping
with
the
level
excellence
of
her
work
her
life
had
been
a
happy
one
free
from
mind
worries
free
from
great
sorrows
her
affections
had
wide
play
her
tastes
full
development
she
was
happy
in
the
love
of
one
very
near
and
dear
and
if
she
missed
great
ecstasies
she
at
least
had
no
hideous
sorrows
to
endure
in
the
sin
or
vice
of
those
near
to
her
her
one
great
sorrow
was
perhaps
the
death
of
her
father
but
he
was
not
young
and
in
the
natural
course
of
events
his
death
can
not
be
called
unexpected
sunny
surrounded
with
the
refinements
that
a
sensitive
mind
appreciates
she
lived
out
a
life
on
a
high
uniform
level
her
books
supplied
a
motive
and
mainspring
that
otherwise
might
have
been
felt
to
be
lacking
by
one
so
energetic
if
as
has
been
said
happiness
on
earth
demands
someone
to
love
something
to
do
