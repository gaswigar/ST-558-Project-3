storm
and

the
count
of
with
the
beautiful
haydée
clinging
lovingly
about
his
neck
her
head
pillowed
upon
his
shoulder
stood
on
the
deck
of
his
superb
yacht
the
alcyon
gazing
at
the
isle
where
he
had
left
maximilian
morrel
and
valentine
de
villefort
it
was
just
daybreak
but
by
the
faint
glimmering
light
he
could
plainly
distinguish
the
figures
of
a
man
and
a
woman
upon
the
distant
beach
they
were
walking
arm
in
arm
presently
another
figure
a
man
approached
them
and
seemed
to
deliver
something
look
said
the
count
to
haydée
jacopo
has
given
maximilian
my
letter
he
reads
it
to
valentine
and
now
they
know
all
jacopo
points
toward
the
yacht
they
see
us
and
are
waving
their
handkerchiefs
in
token
of
adieu
haydée
raised
her
head
and
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
isle
of
i
see
them
my
lord
she
replied
in
a
joyous
tone
they
are
happy
yes
said
the
count
they
are
happy
but
they
deserve
their
happiness
and
all
is
well
they
owe
their
happiness
to
you
my
lord
resumed
haydée
meekly
they
owe
it
to
god
answered
solemnly
i
was
but
his
humble
instrument
and
he
has
allowed
me
in
this
to
make
some
slight
atonement
for
the
wrong
i
committed
in
taking
vengeance
into
my
own
mortal
hands
haydée
was
silent
she
knew
the
sad
history
of
edmond
dantès
and
was
aware
of
how
remorselessly
the
count
of
had
avenged
the
wrongs
of
the
humble
sailor
of
marseilles
this
she
had
learned
from
her
lord
own
lips
within
the
past
few
days
the
strict
seclusion
in
which
she
had
lived
in
paris
had
necessarily
excluded
her
from
all
personal
knowledge
of
the
count
subtle
war
upon
his
enemies
true
she
had
emerged
from
her
retirement
to
testify
against
morcerf
at
his
trial
before
the
house
of
peers
but
at
that
time
she
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
by
causing
the
foe
of
her
family
to
be
convicted
of
felony
treason
and
outrage
she
had
simply
promoted
vengeance
on
fernand
the
catalan
but
though
silent
the
beautiful
greek
girl
with
her
thoroughly
oriental
ideas
could
not
realize
that
the
man
who
stood
beside
her
the
being
she
almost
worshiped
had
been
guilty
of
the
least
wrong
in
avenging
himself
besides
she
would
never
have
admitted
even
in
the
most
secret
recesses
of
her
own
heart
that
who
to
her
mind
symbolized
all
that
was
good
pure
and
heroic
in
human
nature
could
have
been
wrong
in
anything
he
did
meanwhile
the
count
also
had
been
silent
and
a
shade
of
the
deepest
sadness
had
settled
upon
his
pallid
but
intellectual
visage
he
gazed
at
the
isle
of
until
it
became
a
mere
dot
in
the
distance
then
putting
his
arm
tenderly
about
his
lovely
companion
waist
he
drew
her
gently
toward
the
cabin
as
they
vanished
down
the
bertuccio
and
the
captain
of
the
alcyon
followed
by
ali
the
nubian
advanced
to
the
prow
of
the
yacht
captain
said
bertuccio
can
you
tell
me
whither
we
are
bound
i
feel
an
irresistible
desire
to
know
yes
answered
the
captain
i
can
tell
you
the
count
ordered
me
to
make
with
all
possible
speed
for
the
island
of
crete
bertuccio
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
i
feared
we
were
bound
for
italy
he
said
but
he
added
after
an
instant
thought
why
should
we
go
to
rome
luigi
vampa
is
amply
able
to
care
for
all
the
count
interests
there
if
indeed
any
remain
now
that
the
baron
danglars
has
been
attended
to
the
captain
who
was
an
old
italian
smuggler
placed
his
finger
warningly
upon
his
lips
and
glanced
warily
around
when
luigi
name
was
mentioned
but
said
nothing
bertuccio
took
the
hint
and
the
conversation
was
dropped
pressing
onward
under
full
sail
the
magnificent
yacht
shot
over
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
with
the
speed
of
an
eagle
on
the
wing
it
sped
past
corsica
and
sardinia
and
soon
the
arid
uninviting
shores
of
tunis
were
visible
then
it
passed
between
sicily
and
malta
steering
directly
toward
the
island
of
crete
up
to
this
time
the
weather
had
been
of
the
most
delightful
description
not
a
cloud
had
obscured
the
sky
and
during
the
entire
voyage
the
unruffled
surface
of
the
mediterranean
had
resembled
that
of
some
peaceful
lake
it
was
now
the
tenth
of
october
and
just
cool
enough
to
be
pleasant
the
breezes
from
the
coast
of
africa
reached
the
yacht
tempered
by
the
moist
atmosphere
of
the
sea
furnishing
an
additional
element
of
enjoyment
the
count
of
and
haydée
who
seemed
inseparable
came
on
deck
every
morning
at
dawn
and
each
evening
walked
back
and
forth
admiring
the
gorgeous
sunset
and
watching
the
shades
of
night
as
they
gradually
settled
down
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
the
waters
it
required
no
unusual
penetration
to
see
that
they
were
lovers
and
that
their
delight
in
each
other
society
was
unalloyed
haydée
clung
to
the
count
who
with
his
arm
wound
about
her
slender
waist
looked
down
into
the
liquid
depths
of
her
eyes
with
a
smile
of
perfect
content
while
his
free
hand
ever
and
anon
toyed
with
her
tresses
one
evening
as
they
were
walking
thus
it
was
the
evening
of
the
fifteenth
of
october
and
crete
was
distant
but
two
sail
tenderly
took
haydée
hand
in
his
and
said
to
her
in
a
tone
of
ineffable
softness
haydée
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
on
the
isle
of
just
before
we
parted
from
valentine
and
maximilian
oh
yes
my
lord
was
the
low
reply
i
said
i
loved
you
as
one
loves
a
father
brother
husband
i
loved
you
as
my
life
and
do
you
now
regret
those
words
regret
them
oh
my
lord
how
could
i
do
that
i
asked
you
said
the
count
slowly
because
we
are
nearing
our
destination
in
two
days
we
shall
land
upon
the
shore
of
crete
and
once
there
it
is
my
intention
to
make
you
my
wife
provided
your
feelings
toward
me
are
still
unchanged
marriage
my
child
is
the
most
important
step
in
life
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
take
that
step
without
fully
understanding
the
promptings
of
your
own
dear
heart
only
misery
can
follow
the
union
of
two
souls
not
in
perfect
accord
not
entirely
devoted
the
one
to
the
other
i
am
much
older
than
you
haydée
and
my
sufferings
have
aged
me
still
more
than
years
i
am
a
sad
and
weary
man
you
on
the
contrary
stand
just
upon
the
threshold
of
existence
the
world
and
its
pleasures
are
all
before
you
think
my
child
think
deeply
before
you
pronounce
the
irrevocable
vow
haydée
threw
herself
passionately
upon
breast
my
lord
she
cried
in
accents
broken
by
extreme
agitation
and
emotion
am
i
not
your
slave
no
haydée
answered
the
count
his
bosom
heaving
and
his
eyes
lighting
up
with
a
strange
flash
you
are
free
your
fate
rests
in
your
own
hands
then
said
the
young
girl
ardently
i
will
decide
it
this
very
instant
i
accept
my
freedom
that
i
may
voluntarily
offer
myself
to
you
my
love
my
husband
you
have
suffered
granted
so
have
i
your
sufferings
have
aged
you
mine
have
transformed
a
child
into
a
woman
a
woman
who
knows
the
promptings
of
her
heart
who
knows
that
it
beats
for
you
and
you
alone
in
all
the
world
my
lord
i
resign
myself
to
you
do
you
accept
the
gift
as
haydée
concluded
her
beautiful
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
and
her
whole
frame
quivered
with
intense
excitement
bent
down
and
kissed
her
upon
the
forehead
haydée
my
own
haydée
he
said
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
manly
voice
i
accept
the
gift
be
my
wife
the
wife
of
and
no
effort
of
mine
shall
be
wanting
to
assure
your
happiness
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sinister
flash
in
the
heavens
that
were
as
yet
without
a
cloud
the
livid
light
shot
downward
to
the
water
and
seemingly
plunged
to
the
depths
of
the
mediterranean
the
count
gave
a
start
and
drew
his
beloved
haydée
closer
to
him
the
frightened
girl
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
clung
to
him
for
protection
oh
my
lord
my
lord
she
murmured
does
heaven
disapprove
of
our
plighted
troth
calm
yourself
haydée
answered
the
lightning
is
seal
and
he
has
set
it
upon
our
betrothal
the
flash
was
now
repeated
and
was
succeeded
by
several
others
of
increased
intensity
but
as
yet
no
thunder
rolled
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
of
an
approaching
storm
took
haydée
hand
and
led
her
to
the
side
of
the
yacht
not
a
single
wave
wrinkled
the
surface
of
the
sea
for
miles
and
miles
the
water
seemed
asleep
while
down
upon
it
the
moon
poured
a
flood
of
silvery
radiance
the
stars
too
were
beaming
brightly
still
however
the
intense
lightning
shot
athwart
the
placid
sky
it
had
become
almost
incessant
could
not
account
for
the
bewildering
phenomenon
he
summoned
the
captain
of
the
alcyon
and
said
to
him
giacomo
you
have
sailed
the
mediterranean
all
your
life
have
you
not
all
my
life
excellency
replied
he
touching
his
cap
have
you
ever
before
seen
lightning
such
as
this
on
a
calm
night
never
excellency
it
certainly
can
not
be
i
think
not
excellency
has
a
quicker
flash
and
is
much
less
intense
what
do
you
suppose
it
portends
i
can
form
no
idea
excellency
oh
my
lord
said
haydée
a
terrible
storm
is
coming
i
am
sure
i
feel
a
premonition
of
approaching
danger
i
pray
you
guard
against
it
nonsense
my
child
returned
with
a
laugh
that
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
at
betrayed
nervous
agitation
and
an
undefinable
dread
the
sky
is
clear
the
moon
is
shining
brilliantly
and
the
sea
is
altogether
tranquil
if
a
storm
were
coming
it
would
not
be
so
banish
your
fears
and
reassure
yourself
the
lightning
is
but
a
freak
of
nature
the
captain
too
was
disturbed
though
he
could
give
himself
no
satisfactory
reason
for
his
uneasiness
ali
with
the
characteristic
superstition
of
the
nubian
race
had
prostrated
himself
upon
the
deck
and
was
making
signs
the
moslems
of
his
country
use
to
drive
away
malignant
spirits
the
night
however
passed
without
accident
though
the
singular
lightning
continued
for
several
hours
next
morning
the
sun
rose
encircled
by
a
ruddy
band
fringed
on
the
outer
rim
with
a
faint
yellow
while
its
beams
had
a
sullen
glare
instead
of
their
normal
brilliancy
the
lightning
of
the
previous
night
was
absent
but
soon
another
and
not
less
disquieting
phenomenon
manifested
itself
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
sea
seemed
boiling
and
at
intervals
a
puff
as
if
of
vapor
would
filter
through
the
waves
rising
and
disappearing
in
the
heavens
meanwhile
the
wind
had
fallen
and
amid
an
almost
dead
calm
the
sails
of
the
alcyon
hung
listlessly
with
only
an
occasional
flapping
the
yacht
moved
forward
indeed
but
so
slowly
that
it
scarcely
appeared
to
move
at
all
and
haydée
came
on
deck
at
dawn
but
the
young
girl
displayed
such
terror
at
the
unwonted
aspect
of
the
sun
and
the
sea
that
the
count
speedily
persuaded
her
to
return
with
him
to
the
cabin
there
she
cowered
upon
a
divan
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
moaning
piteously
her
fiancé
distressed
at
her
condition
endeavored
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
but
utterly
without
avail
her
fears
could
neither
be
banished
nor
allayed
at
length
he
threw
himself
on
a
rug
at
her
feet
and
disengaging
her
hands
from
her
face
drew
them
about
his
neck
haydée
clasped
him
frantically
and
clung
to
him
as
if
she
deemed
that
embrace
a
final
one
as
they
were
sitting
thus
the
alcyon
received
a
sudden
and
violent
shock
that
shook
the
noble
yacht
from
stem
to
stern
instantly
there
was
a
sound
of
hurrying
feet
on
deck
and
the
captain
could
be
heard
shouting
hoarsely
to
the
sailors
leaped
up
and
caught
haydée
in
his
arms
at
that
moment
ali
darted
down
the
and
stood
trembling
before
his
master
what
was
that
shock
demanded
the
count
hurriedly
the
agitated
nubian
made
a
sign
signifying
he
did
not
know
but
that
all
was
yet
safe
remain
with
your
mistress
ali
said
i
am
going
to
see
what
is
the
matter
oh
no
no
cried
haydée
imploringly
as
the
count
placed
her
again
on
the
divan
and
was
moving
away
oh
no
no
do
not
leave
me
my
lord
or
i
shall
die
ashy
pale
haydée
arose
from
the
divan
and
cast
herself
on
her
knees
at
feet
swear
to
me
at
least
that
you
will
not
needlessly
expose
yourself
to
danger
she
uttered
in
a
pleading
tone
i
swear
it
answered
the
count
ali
will
faithfully
guard
you
while
i
am
gone
he
added
and
ere
you
can
realize
my
absence
i
shall
be
again
at
your
side
with
these
words
he
tore
himself
away
and
hastened
to
the
deck
there
a
scene
met
his
eye
as
unexpected
as
it
was
appalling
the
entire
surface
of
the
mediterranean
was
aglow
with
phosphorescence
and
the
sun
was
veiled
completely
by
a
heavy
cloud
that
seemed
to
cover
the
whole
expanse
of
the
sky
this
cloud
was
not
black
but
of
a
bloody
hue
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
densely
charged
with
sulphur
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
breathe
the
sea
was
boiling
more
furiously
than
ever
and
the
puffs
of
vapor
that
had
before
only
occasionally
filtered
through
the
waves
now
leaped
up
incessantly
each
puff
attended
with
a
slight
explosion
the
vapor
was
grayish
when
it
first
arose
from
the
water
but
as
it
ascended
it
became
red
mingling
at
length
with
the
bloody
cloud
that
each
moment
acquired
greater
density
the
wind
blew
fitfully
sometimes
amounting
to
a
gale
and
then
utterly
vanishing
without
the
slightest
warning
soon
the
bloody
cloud
seemed
to
settle
of
its
own
weight
upon
the
sea
growing
so
thick
that
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
it
and
a
few
feet
from
the
yacht
all
was
inky
darkness
hurried
to
the
captain
who
was
endeavoring
to
quiet
the
superstitious
fears
of
the
sailors
drawing
him
aside
he
said
in
a
low
tone
giacomo
we
are
in
frightful
danger
this
elemental
disturbance
is
volcanic
and
how
it
will
end
can
not
be
foretold
no
doubt
an
earthquake
is
devastating
the
nearest
land
or
will
do
so
before
many
hours
have
elapsed
at
any
moment
rocks
or
islands
may
arise
from
the
sea
and
obstruct
our
passage
all
we
can
do
is
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
for
whatever
calamity
may
happen
and
make
for
crete
as
rapidly
as
possible
with
the
hope
of
eventually
getting
beyond
the
volcanic
zone
do
not
enlighten
the
crew
as
to
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
did
they
know
or
even
suspect
it
they
could
not
be
controlled
but
would
become
either
stupefied
or
reckless
try
to
convince
them
that
we
are
simply
in
the
midst
of
a
severe
electrical
storm
that
will
speedily
exhaust
its
fury
and
subside
now
to
work
and
remember
that
everything
depends
upon
your
courage
and
resolution
giacomo
rejoined
the
sailors
who
were
huddled
together
at
the
stern
of
the
yacht
like
so
many
frightened
sheep
he
spoke
to
them
doing
his
utmost
to
reassure
them
and
ultimately
succeeded
so
well
that
they
resumed
their
neglected
duties
with
some
show
of
alacrity
and
even
cheerfulness
meanwhile
with
folded
arms
and
an
outward
show
of
calmness
was
pacing
the
deck
as
if
nothing
unusual
were
in
progress
and
his
demeanor
was
not
without
its
effect
on
the
sailors
who
looked
upon
him
with
a
species
of
awe
and
admiration
at
times
he
went
below
to
cheer
the
drooping
spirits
of
his
beloved
haydée
but
speedily
returned
that
the
influence
of
his
presence
might
not
be
lost
thus
the
day
passed
a
night
of
painful
suspense
succeeded
it
during
which
not
a
soul
on
board
the
alcyon
thought
of
sleeping
nothing
however
occurred
save
that
the
intense
lightning
of
the
previous
night
was
renewed
toward
eleven
the
breeze
freshened
to
such
an
extent
that
the
yacht
sped
along
on
her
course
with
great
fleetness
in
the
morning
the
sun
arose
amid
a
purple
haze
and
the
mediterranean
presented
a
more
tumultuous
and
threatening
aspect
than
it
had
the
preceding
day
the
breeze
was
still
blowing
stiffly
and
the
lightning
continued
giacomo
informed
that
unless
a
calm
should
suddenly
come
on
they
would
certainly
arrive
at
crete
by
noon
the
sailors
he
added
were
in
good
spirits
and
might
be
relied
upon
though
they
were
much
fatigued
by
reason
of
their
unceasing
labor
at
ten
the
man
at
the
wheel
hurriedly
summoned
the
captain
to
his
side
and
with
a
look
of
terror
and
bewilderment
directed
his
attention
to
the
compass
the
needle
of
which
no
longer
pointed
to
the
north
but
was
dancing
a
mad
dance
not
remaining
stationary
for
a
single
instant
to
complicate
the
situation
still
further
the
sun
was
suddenly
obscured
absolute
darkness
invading
both
sea
and
sky
only
when
the
vivid
lightning
tore
the
dense
clouds
apart
were
those
on
board
the
alcyon
enabled
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
about
them
and
that
glimpse
was
but
momentary
thunder
peals
were
now
added
to
the
terrors
of
the
time
while
the
yacht
tossed
and
plunged
on
angry
threatening
billows
showers
of
sparks
and
glowing
cinders
as
if
from
some
mighty
conflagration
poured
down
into
the
water
striking
its
surface
with
an
ominous
hiss
they
resembled
meteors
and
their
brilliancy
was
augmented
by
the
surrounding
gloom
rain
also
began
to
descend
not
in
drops
but
in
broad
sheets
and
with
the
roar
of
a
cataract
in
a
moment
everybody
on
the
alcyon
deck
was
drenched
to
the
skin
haydée
had
not
ventured
from
the
cabin
since
the
first
day
of
the
elemental
commotion
in
obedience
to
his
master
commands
ali
constantly
watched
over
her
whenever
the
count
was
facing
the
strange
storm
with
giacomo
and
the
sailors
as
the
captain
approached
the
man
at
the
wheel
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
old
italian
countenance
and
saw
it
assume
a
deathly
pallor
as
he
noticed
that
the
needle
of
the
compass
could
no
longer
be
depended
on
in
an
instant
the
count
was
beside
him
and
realized
the
extent
of
the
new
evil
that
had
befallen
them
we
can
steer
but
by
guess
now
said
giacomo
in
a
low
hoarse
whisper
god
grant
that
we
may
be
able
to
reach
our
destination
as
he
spoke
a
loud
crash
was
heard
and
the
rudder
torn
from
its
fastenings
by
the
violence
of
the
tempest
swept
by
them
vanishing
amid
the
darkness
the
man
at
the
wheel
gazed
after
it
uttering
a
cry
of
despair
we
are
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
waves
said
in
an
undertone
can
nothing
be
done
he
added
hurriedly
nothing
excellency
returned
the
captain
a
temporary
rudder
might
be
rigged
were
the
sea
calmer
but
boiling
and
seething
as
it
is
such
a
thing
is
utterly
impossible
a
panic
had
seized
upon
the
sailors
as
they
witnessed
the
catastrophe
that
rendered
the
alcyon
helpless
but
this
immediately
gave
place
to
stupor
and
the
men
stood
silent
and
overwhelmed
bertuccio
from
the
time
the
dread
storm
had
broken
forth
had
been
gloomy
and
uncommunicative
he
had
held
persistently
aloof
both
from
and
the
crew
in
the
general
turmoil
and
confusion
his
bearing
and
behavior
had
passed
unnoticed
even
by
the
vigilant
eye
of
the
count
the
steward
now
approached
his
master
and
taking
him
aside
whispered
in
his
ear
heaven
vengeance
is
pursuing
the
alcyon
and
all
on
board
because
of
my
crimes
i
feel
it
i
know
it
the
steward
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
his
eye
betokened
fixed
resolution
not
another
word
of
this
cried
sternly
should
the
superstitious
sailors
hear
you
they
would
demand
with
one
voice
that
you
be
cast
into
the
boiling
sea
and
they
would
be
right
rejoined
bertuccio
doggedly
if
i
remain
where
i
am
the
alcyon
doom
is
sealed
on
the
other
hand
the
moment
you
are
rid
of
me
the
storm
will
cease
as
if
by
magic
and
you
will
be
saved
be
silent
commanded
you
are
a
corsican
show
a
corsican
courage
i
will
was
the
determined
reply
and
the
steward
walked
with
a
firm
tread
to
the
side
of
the
yacht
what
do
you
mean
said
the
count
hurrying
after
him
and
placing
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
shall
see
answered
bertuccio
shaking
off
grasp
he
leaped
upon
the
bulwarks
and
suddenly
sprang
far
out
amid
the
seething
waves
the
count
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
that
was
echoed
by
the
captain
as
for
the
crew
so
utterly
stupefied
were
they
that
they
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
the
suicidal
act
for
an
instant
and
giacomo
saw
the
steward
whirling
about
amid
the
tumultuous
flood
then
he
was
swept
away
and
vanished
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
beyond
the
force
of
the
wind
had
meanwhile
augmented
until
a
perfect
hurricane
was
raging
about
the
alcyon
the
noise
was
deafening
and
the
sails
swelled
to
such
an
extent
that
they
threatened
to
snap
asunder
suddenly
they
gave
way
and
the
tattered
shreds
flew
in
all
directions
like
simultaneously
the
mast
toppled
and
went
by
the
board
the
yacht
now
a
helpless
wreck
pitched
and
tossed
but
still
shot
onward
impelled
by
the
wild
fury
of
the
gale
gigantic
waves
at
intervals
swept
the
deck
each
torrent
as
it
retreated
carrying
with
it
all
it
could
tear
away
and
making
huge
gaps
in
the
bulwarks
to
which
the
sailors
were
clinging
with
all
the
energy
of
desperation
had
grasped
the
stump
of
the
mast
and
the
captain
clung
with
all
his
strength
to
the
remains
of
the
wheel
the
lightning
had
become
terrific
and
the
almost
continuous
roar
of
the
thunder
was
sufficient
to
drown
the
mad
din
of
the
waters
all
at
once
the
jagged
outlines
of
a
gigantic
rock
loomed
up
directly
in
the
course
of
the
fated
vessel
in
another
instant
the
alcyon
struck
and
remained
fast
while
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
revealed
what
appeared
to
be
an
island
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
but
though
the
wreck
of
the
yacht
was
motionless
the
furious
sea
continued
to
break
over
the
deck
and
it
seemed
only
a
question
of
a
few
moments
when
the
battered
and
torn
hull
of
the
alcyon
would
go
to
pieces
the
boat
the
vessel
carried
had
long
since
been
wrenched
from
its
fastenings
and
swept
into
the
whirlpool
quitting
the
stump
of
the
mast
darted
down
the
into
the
cabin
and
quickly
returned
to
the
deck
bearing
in
his
arms
the
swooning
form
of
his
adored
haydée
ali
followed
him
the
nubian
seemed
to
have
entirely
recovered
from
his
fear
and
manifested
both
alertness
and
decision
shifting
his
lifeless
burden
to
his
left
arm
and
grasping
her
firmly
advanced
to
the
side
of
the
alcyon
pausing
there
for
an
instant
he
said
addressing
giacomo
and
the
crew
the
yacht
can
not
hold
together
much
longer
if
we
remain
where
we
are
we
shall
inevitably
be
ground
to
powder
on
the
rock
with
our
vessel
there
is
an
island
some
distance
to
the
right
of
us
and
sustained
by
providence
we
may
succeed
in
reaching
it
by
swimming
for
my
part
i
shall
try
the
venture
and
endeavor
to
save
this
lady
you
men
are
untrammeled
and
stand
a
better
chance
of
success
than
i
do
i
advise
you
all
to
follow
my
example
to
cling
further
to
the
wreck
is
death
with
these
words
the
count
made
his
way
to
a
gap
in
the
bulwarks
and
grasping
haydée
tightly
leaped
with
her
into
the
midst
of
the
angry
sea
ali
followed
his
master
and
soon
they
were
seen
far
in
the
distance
struggling
and
battling
with
the
waves
chapter
ii
the
island
it
was
the
month
of
december
but
on
the
little
island
of
salmis
in
the
grecian
archipelago
the
temperature
was
as
mild
and
genial
as
that
of
june
the
grass
was
rank
and
thick
while
the
blooming
almond
trees
filled
the
atmosphere
with
fragrance
on
a
narrow
strip
of
sandy
beach
three
or
four
fishermen
were
preparing
their
nets
and
boats
for
a
fishing
expedition
to
the
waters
beyond
they
chatted
as
they
toiled
the
eldest
of
them
a
man
about
sixty
with
silvered
locks
and
a
long
gray
beard
said
you
may
talk
of
storms
as
much
as
you
please
but
i
maintain
that
the
most
severe
tempest
ever
experienced
in
this
neighborhood
was
the
one
i
witnessed
ten
years
ago
last
october
when
we
had
the
earthquake
and
the
strange
man
who
now
owns
this
island
was
washed
ashore
the
count
of
you
mean
remarked
one
of
the
party
yes
the
count
of
who
has
done
so
much
for
us
all
and
whose
wife
is
nothing
less
than
an
angel
of
goodness
and
charity
you
rescued
him
did
you
not
alexis
i
found
him
lying
upon
the
beach
with
the
lady
who
is
now
his
wife
tightly
clasped
in
his
arms
so
tightly
that
i
had
no
end
of
trouble
to
separate
them
both
were
unconscious
at
the
time
and
no
wonder
for
the
sea
was
furious
and
they
must
have
been
dashed
about
at
a
fearful
rate
it
was
a
miracle
they
escaped
with
their
lives
near
them
lay
that
african
their
servant
who
styles
himself
ali
as
well
as
the
corpses
of
several
sailors
the
african
however
revived
just
as
i
approached
him
he
a
man
of
iron
i
tell
you
for
he
immediately
leaped
to
his
feet
and
helped
me
to
restore
his
master
and
mistress
when
they
came
to
i
took
the
whole
party
to
my
hut
and
cared
for
them
the
next
day
i
rowed
the
count
and
the
african
out
to
the
wreck
of
their
vessel
on
that
rock
you
see
away
over
there
and
they
brought
back
with
them
a
fabulous
amount
of
money
and
jewels
that
they
found
in
the
strangest
closets
i
ever
saw
in
the
cabin
then
the
count
bought
this
island
and
has
lived
here
ever
since
he
took
the
lady
to
athens
and
was
married
to
her
there
and
on
his
return
he
had
the
palace
they
now
occupy
built
in
the
midst
of
the
palm
grove
by
this
time
the
fishermen
had
completed
their
preparations
and
leaping
into
their
boats
they
started
on
their
expedition
the
palace
in
the
palm
grove
to
which
old
alexis
had
alluded
was
indeed
a
magnificent
dwelling
suitable
in
every
respect
for
the
residence
of
an
oriental
monarch
it
was
built
in
the
turkish
fashion
and
its
exterior
was
singularly
beautiful
and
imposing
huge
palm
trees
surrounded
it
they
were
planted
in
regular
rows
upon
a
vast
lawn
that
was
adorned
with
costly
statues
and
fountains
while
at
intervals
were
scattered
great
flower
beds
filled
with
choice
exotics
and
blooming
plants
of
endless
variety
a
wide
graveled
walk
and
led
to
the
palace
the
main
entrance
to
which
was
flanked
on
either
side
by
columns
of
marble
the
edifice
itself
was
of
green
stone
and
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
like
a
colossal
emerald
it
was
surmounted
by
three
domes
above
each
of
which
towered
a
gilded
crescent
within
all
was
elegance
and
luxury
there
were
immense
salons
with
marble
floors
and
walls
covered
with
smyrna
hangings
of
the
most
beautiful
description
that
of
themselves
must
have
cost
a
fortune
these
salons
were
furnished
with
rich
divans
tables
of
malachite
cabinets
of
ebony
and
oriental
rugs
of
the
most
artistic
and
complicated
workmanship
there
were
dazzling
reception
rooms
filled
with
exquisite
statues
and
superb
paintings
the
works
of
the
greatest
sculptors
and
artists
of
the
east
and
west
of
the
past
and
the
present

thorwaldsen

beside
antique
masterpieces
framed
by
the
genius
of

and
his
brother
sculptors
of

and

masterpieces
that
had
been
torn
from
the
ruins
of
antiquity
by
the
hand
of
the
untiring

specimens

of

murillo
rubens
van
dyck
rembrandt
sir
joshua
reynolds
and
other
votaries
of
the

whose
names
are
immortal
these
paintings
did
not
hang
on
the
walls
for
they
were
covered
with
rich
tapestry
from
the
looms
of
benares
and
the
gobelins
but
rested
on
delicately
fashioned
easels
themselves
entitled
to
a
high
rank
as

were

the
vast
library
was
encircled
by
lofty
bookcases
of
walnut
and
ebony
filled
with
rare
and
costly
volumes
from
the
curiously
illuminated
missals
of
monkish
days
to
the
latest
scientific
works
together
with
a
liberal
sprinkling
of
poetry
and
fiction
upon
tables
stands
and
mantels
were
superb
ornaments
in
brass
repoussé
work
and
grand
old
faïence
including
some
wonderful
specimens
of
ancient
chinese
crackle
ware
the
peculiar
secret
of
the
manufacture
of
which
had
been
lost
in
the
flight
of
ages
at
an
exquisite
desk
of
walnut
carved
with
grotesque
images
sat
the
count
of
he
was
busily
engaged
in
writing
and
beside
him
lay
a
huge
pile
of
manuscript
that
was
ever
and
anon
augmented
by
an
additional
sheet
hastily
scrawled
in
strange
bewildering
semitic
characters
the
count
showed
but
small
trace
of
the
passage
of
years
he
did
not
look
much
older
than
when
he
left
the
isle
of
with
haydée
on
that
voyage
which
was
destined
to
result
so
disastrously
for
the
alcyon
and
her
crew
to
be
sure
his
hair
was
slightly
flecked
with
gray
but
his
visage
still
retained
its
full
outline
and
not
a
wrinkle
marred
its
masculine
beauty
he
was
clad
in
an
exceedingly
picturesque
costume
half
greek
and
half
turkish
while
upon
his
head
was
a
red
fez
from
the
centre
of
which
hung
down
a
gilt
tassel
as
he
wrote
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
seemed
filled
with
enthusiasm
at
length
he
threw
aside
his
pen
and
rising
began
to
pace
the
vast
apartment
with
long
strides
alas
he
muttered
perhaps
after
all
i
am
only
a
vain
dreamer
as
hosts
of
others
have
been
before
me
but
no
my
scheme
is
feasible
and
can
not
fail
it
is
based
on
sound
principles
and
a
thorough
knowledge
of
mankind
besides
the
immense
wealth
that
an
god
has
placed
at
my
disposal
will
aid
me
and
form
a
mighty
factor
in
the
cause
in
the
past
i
used
that
wealth
solely
for
my
own
selfish
ends
but
now
all
is
different
i
have
no
thought
of
self
the
philanthropist
has
replaced
the
egotist
i
have
aided
the
poor
relieved
the
stricken
and
brought
joy
to
many
a
sorrowing
home
but
hitherto
i
have
acted
only
in
isolated
cases
now
i
meditate
a
grand
a
sublime
stroke
to
give
freedom
to
man
throughout
the
entire
length
and
breadth
of
the
continent
of
europe
if
i
succeed
and
succeed
i
must
every
human
being
from
the
coast
of
france
to
the
ural
mountains
from
the
sunny
mediterranean
to
the
frozen
arctic
ocean
will
reap
the
benefit
of
my
efforts
and
shake
off
the
yoke
of
tyranny
where
shall
i
begin
ah
with
france
my
own
country
the
land
that
gave
me
birth
i
shall
thus
return
good
for
evil
and
edmond
dantès
the
prisoner
of
the
château
will
free
the
masses
from
their
galling
chains
my
most
potent
instrument
will
be
the
public
press
by
means
of
journals
i
will
found
or
buy
the
minds
of
all
europeans
shall
become
familiarized
with
the
theory
of
universal
liberty
and
ripened
for
sweeping
revolutions
and
the
establishment
of
republics
i
will
also
call
fiction
to
my
aid
struggling
novelists
and
feuilletonists
shall
receive
liberal
subsidies
from
my
hand
on
condition
that
they
disseminate
my
ideas
theories
and
plans
in
their
romances
and
feuilletons
thus
will
i
reach
thousands
upon
thousands
who
hold
themselves
aloof
from
politics
and
almost
insensibly
they
will
be
transformed
into
zealous
active
partisans
of
the
order
of
things
that
is
to
be
poets
too
shall
sing
the
praises
of
freedom
louder
and
more
enthusiastically
than
ever
before
in
fine
no
instrument
no
means
however
humble
and
apparently
insignificant
shall
be
neglected
when
the
proper
moment
arrives
but
until
it
does
arrive
i
must
wait
wait
patiently
wait
though
while
waiting
an
internal
fire
consume
me
and
my
veins
throb
with
anxiety
and
expectation
to
the
point
of
bursting
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
was
lost
in
profound
thought
meanwhile
a
lovely
woman
leading
a
beautiful
girl
of
eight
years
and
a
handsome
boy
of
nine
had
noiselessly
entered
the
apartment
it
was
haydée
the
wife
of
haydée
grown
mature
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
her
tresses
were
gathered
in
two
wide
braids
at
the
back
of
her
shapely
head
so
long
that
they
reached
below
her
waist
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
stars
and
her
slender
hands
tipped
with
their
pink
nails
as
white
as
the
lily
her
tiny
feet
encased
in
cinderella
slippers
of
satin
peeped
out
from
beneath
ample
turkish
trousers
which
were
and
disclosed
the
outlines
of
her
beautifully
turned
limbs
she
wore
a
gilet
of
pearly
silk
adorned
with
gilt
fringe
and
cut
low
displaying
her
snowy
neck
and
magnificent
shoulders
her
arms
were
encompassed
but
not
hidden
by
flowing
sleeves
of
filmy
gauze
as
fine
as
the
tissue
of
a
web
about
her
neck
flashed
a
collar
of
brilliant
diamonds
of
enormous
value
and
on
her
tapering
fingers
were
rings
of
emerald
ruby
and
sapphire
on
her
head
was
a
red
fez
precisely
similar
to
her
husband
her
countenance
a
perfect
revelation
of
angelic
beauty
was
wreathed
in
sunny
smiles
that
betokened
thorough
happiness
and
contentment
the
little
girl
zuleika
the
daughter
of
was
her
exact
image
a
reproduction
of
her
lovely
mother
in
miniature
a
promise
of
rare
delight
for
the
future
the
child
costume
was
also
modeled
after
haydée
but
with
modifications
suited
to
her
tender
years
zuleika
was
of
a
gentle
loving
disposition
but
a
vein
of
romance
and
poetry
had
already
developed
itself
in
her
notwithstanding
her
extreme
youth
she
sighed
for
the
unknown
delights
of
the
sea
and
the
wail
of
the
surf
sounded
to
her
like
the
most
delicious
of
mysterious
harmonies
her
infant
imagination
peopled
the
watery
realm
with
spirits
of
good
and
evil
always
in
contention
and
the
great
ships
with
their
huge
white
sails
that
she
saw
in
the
distance
from
the
sandy
beach
of
the
island
of
salmis
were
in
her
eyes
the
mighty
birds
of
arabian
story
the
boy
espérance
the
son
of
resembled
his
father
both
in
disposition
and
appearance
his
youthful
soul
was
full
of
noble
aspirations
while
his
daring
and
bravery
filled
even
the
hardy
fishermen
of
the
coast
with
wonder
and
amazement
he
was
a
very
manly
and
handsome
child
quick
enthusiastic
and
energetic
his
father
hope
and
his
mother
idol
though
haydée
saw
with
extreme
uneasiness
that
the
little
lad
was
wise
beyond
his
years
and
was
already
devoted
to
somewhat
visionary
schemes
which
he
appeared
to
grasp
in
all
their
complicated
details
his
attire
was
that
of
a
greek
fisher
boy
his
trousers
rolled
up
above
his
knees
displayed
his
naked
legs
and
bare
feet
in
one
hand
he
held
a
rough
sea
cap
that
he
had
removed
from
his
head
at
the
door
of
the
library
espérance
loved
above
all
other
things
to
be
with
the
fishermen
on
the
beach
and
his
joy
knew
no
bounds
when
he
was
permitted
to
accompany
them
on
their
fishing
expeditions
to
the
waters
beyond
haydée
remained
silently
gazing
at
for
a
moment
then
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
room
she
stood
beside
him
with
the
children
zuleika
dropping
her
mother
hand
sprang
lightly
upon
her
father
knees
and
clasping
him
about
the
neck
with
her
chubby
arms
kissed
him
rapturously
the
count
started
from
his
deep
reverie
and
returned
his
kiss
then
looking
up
he
perceived
haydée
and
espérance
ah
my
loved
ones
said
he
so
you
are
all
here
yes
papa
returned
zuleika
in
a
clear
crystal
voice
that
sounded
like
the
tinkle
of
a
fairy
bell
we
are
all
here
mamma
espérance
and
smiled
faintly
and
patted
the
little
girl
tenderly
on
the
cheek
haydée
said
he
fortune
favors
us
in
our
children
they
are
indeed
a
blessing
to
us
a
veritable
blessing
my
lord
answered
the
lovely
haydée
but
still
i
can
not
help
feeling
some
terror
at
the
thought
that
espérance
may
one
day
be
drawn
into
those
political
struggles
you
have
so
often
foretold
and
in
which
it
is
your
intention
to
act
a
prominent
part
papa
will
lead
the
people
to
victory
and
i
will
fight
by
his
side
cried
espérance
proudly
haydée
gazed
sadly
at
the
enthusiastic
boy
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
oh
my
lord
she
said
to
her
husband
teach
espérance
the
arts
of
peace
implant
in
his
boyish
bosom
while
there
is
yet
time
the
love
of
home
and
domestic
joys
the
count
glanced
admiringly
at
the
little
lad
who
stood
with
dilated
nostrils
and
eyes
flashing
fire
then
turning
to
haydée
he
said
in
an
impressive
tone
my
beloved
wife
espérance
is
but
an
infant
and
it
may
be
years
ere
europe
shall
awake
from
her
lethargy
and
strive
to
overturn
the
thrones
of
her
despots
before
that
period
the
period
of
revolution
and
bloodshed
our
son
may
change
his
opinions
and
cease
to
be
the
ardent
republican
he
is
now
no
no
protested
the
enthusiastic
boy
i
will
be
a
republican
all
my
life
smiled
sadly
and
drawing
the
lad
to
his
knee
said
to
him
espérance
my
son
you
are
yet
too
young
to
know
the
ways
of
the
world
and
the
snares
that
monarchs
set
for
the
inexperienced
and
unwary
there
are
temptations
at
their
command
capable
of
winning
over
even
the
most
zealous
enemies
and
they
never
hesitate
to
use
them
when
the
opportunity
offers
at
the
proper
time
i
will
instruct
you
fully
about
all
this
now
you
can
not
understand
it
as
ceased
to
speak
ali
entered
the
library
followed
by
three
native
servants
attached
to
the
palace
the
nubian
bowed
low
before
his
master
and
reverently
kissed
haydée
hand
the
servants
did
likewise
then
ali
handed
the
count
a
sealed
letter
making
signs
to
the
effect
that
he
had
found
it
tied
with
a
cord
to
one
of
the
palm
trees
on
the
lawn
opened
the
letter
and
glanced
at
the
signature
as
he
did
so
a
look
of
surprise
and
annoyance
settled
upon
his
face
the
note
was
written
in
the
french
language
and
read
as
follows
count
of
i
am
in
hiding
on
the
island
of
salmis
and
must
see
you
without
delay
meet
me
at
midnight
in
the
almond
grove
near
the
eastern
shore
be
sure
to
come
alone
benedetto
humph
said
the
count
to
himself
as
he
finished
reading
this
singular
epistle
i
thought
i
was
rid
of
that
scoundrel
forever
but
it
seems
that
the
galleys
at
toulon
can
not
hold
him
well
i
suppose
i
must
meet
him
otherwise
he
may
take
a
notion
to
come
here
which
would
be
both
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
i
imagine
he
wants
a
little
money
to
enable
him
to
escape
to
the
east
if
that
is
all
i
will
gladly
give
it
to
be
rid
of
his
presence
on
the
island
i
prefer
not
to
have
as
a
neighbor
a
thief
and
an
assassin
even
if
he
did
shine
so
brilliantly
once
in
aristocratic
parisian
society
as
the
prince
cavalcanti
what
is
the
matter
my
lord
asked
haydée
noticing
the
expression
on
countenance
from
whom
is
the
letter
oh
it
is
nothing
answered
the
count
with
a
smile
a
poor
fellow
wishes
my
assistance
and
is
too
modest
to
ask
it
in
person
all
haydée
was
not
satisfied
with
this
indefinite
reply
she
knew
that
the
contents
of
the
letter
so
strangely
conveyed
to
her
husband
had
vexed
and
troubled
him
but
she
also
knew
that
could
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
about
anything
he
wished
to
keep
secret
and
therefore
judged
it
useless
to
attempt
further
questions
besides
a
singular
presentiment
of
evil
had
taken
possession
of
her
at
the
sight
of
the
ominous
note
and
she
felt
certain
that
some
disaster
was
threatened
hence
she
determined
to
be
watchful
and
keep
strict
guard
over
her
children
until
the
mystery
whatever
it
was
should
be
cleared
up
as
the
clock
in
his
library
struck
the
quarter
before
midnight
arose
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
donning
his
fez
and
a
light
cloak
he
prepared
to
go
to
the
almond
grove
on
the
eastern
portion
of
the
island
the
spot
benedetto
had
appointed
for
their
meeting
prior
to
setting
out
he
slipped
into
his
pocket
a
purse
and
thrust
a
loaded
revolver
into
the
belt
he
wore
about
his
waist
the
scoundrel
was
anxious
that
i
should
come
alone
but
he
did
not
prohibit
me
from
arming
myself
muttered
he
with
a
grim
smile
and
i
have
seen
too
much
of
signor
benedetto
to
care
to
leave
the
game
entirely
in
his
hands
quitting
the
palace
by
a
private
door
after
making
sure
that
everybody
was
asleep
and
that
he
was
unobserved
bent
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
almond
grove
it
was
a
moonless
night
and
very
dark
the
air
was
rather
chill
while
the
roar
of
the
surf
sounded
louder
than
usual
in
the
crisp
bracing
atmosphere
the
count
gathered
his
cloak
tightly
about
him
and
walked
steadily
onward
notwithstanding
the
thick
darkness
at
length
the
heavy
odor
of
the
almond
blossoms
warned
him
that
he
was
approaching
his
destination
and
he
paused
to
survey
the
scene
about
fifty
yards
away
the
almond
grove
loomed
up
casting
a
denser
shade
upon
the
surrounding
blackness
the
count
hastened
his
steps
and
in
a
few
seconds
stood
among
the
trees
as
he
paused
the
figure
of
a
man
emerged
from
behind
a
huge
fragment
of
rock
and
thus
hailed
him
are
you
the
count
of
i
am
was
the
firm
reply
and
are
you
alone
as
i
recommended
entirely
alone
now
if
you
have
finished
your
questions
pray
who
are
you
why
do
you
ask
merely
for
form
sake
well
then
i
am
benedetto
of
course
as
it
was
too
dark
for
me
to
distinguish
your
features
i
simply
wanted
to
identify
you
now
state
your
business
as
briefly
as
possible
i
escaped
from
toulon
long
ago
and
after
wandering
all
over
europe
settled
in
athens
where
i
remained
until
a
week
since
when
the
result
of
a
difficulty
compelled
me
to
quit
the
city
an
assassination
yes
an
assassination
shuddered
to
hear
the
villain
talk
so
calmly
of
his
foul
crime
but
conquering
his
aversion
he
said
between
his
teeth
proceed
i
fled
from
athens
under
cover
of
the
night
and
the
next
morning
hired
a
fisherman
to
bring
me
here
in
his
boat
thinking
that
the
island
was
inhabited
only
by
a
few
wretches
who
gained
a
scanty
subsistence
from
the
sea
on
my
arrival
i
was
filled
with
terror
at
beholding
your
magnificent
palace
which
i
was
told
belonged
to
a
great
lord
i
naturally
imagined
that
no
one
could
inhabit
such
a
dwelling
save
some
high
official
of
the
greek
government
and
without
making
further
inquiries
again
secured
the
services
of
the
fisherman
who
took
me
to
the
neighboring
island
of
kylo
there
i
was
in
safety
for
i
fell
in
with
a
band
of
men
of
whom
i
eventually
became
the
chief
bandits
no
doubt
yes
bandits
if
you
will
but
valiant
men
all
the
same
we
prospered
exceedingly
and
imagined
that
our
career
could
be
continued
with
impunity
as
long
as
we
might
desire
in
this
however
we
were
sadly
mistaken
for
one
fatal
night
the
greek
soldiery
suddenly
descended
upon
us
and
hemmed
us
in
on
every
side
ere
we
were
aware
of
their
presence
we
fought
none
the
less
desperately
on
that
account
and
in
the
sanguinary
conflict
all
my
companions
were
slain
i
was
grievously
wounded
and
left
for
dead
but
the
following
day
managed
to
crawl
to
the
beach
and
contrived
to
be
conveyed
hither
having
learned
by
accident
that
the
great
lord
of
the
island
of
salmis
was
no
other
than
my
old
friend
of
happier
days
the
count
of
in
short
yourself
now
you
know
my
story
i
am
a
fugitive
here
as
in
france
and
need
your
aid
to
enable
me
to
escape
you
want
money
yes
how
much
a
million
of
francs
man
cried
breathless
with
astonishment
at
audacious
demand
you
are
out
of
your
senses
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
francs
but
not
a
sou
more
beware
how
you
trifle
with
a
desperate
man
hissed
benedetto
what
have
i
to
fear
said
calmly
you
are
alone
i
am
not
alone
count
of
my
friends
of
the
island
of
kylo
are
with
me
and
ready
to
support
my
demand
then
you
lied
to
me
your
story
was
a
base
fabrication
partly
count
but
enough
of
this
i
want
the
million
of
francs
it
is
a
small
sum
for
you
to
spare
an
old
friend
who
did
you
as
much
service
as
prince
andrea
cavalcanti
are
you
going
to
give
me
the
money
i
am
not
replied
drawing
his
revolver
from
his
belt
and
cocking
it
ho
ho
laughed
benedetto
mockingly
that
your
game
is
it
again
i
tell
you
to
beware
how
you
trifle
with
a
desperate
man
at
the
repetition
of
this
phrase
as
if
it
had
been
a
preconcerted
signal
a
dozen
stalwart
figures
started
up
from
the
darkness
and
surrounded
who
instantly
discharged
his
weapon
right
and
left
among
them
several
of
the
bandits
fell
pierced
by
the
balls
and
benedetto
with
a
loud
oath
leaped
at
the
count
throat
brandishing
a
long
dagger
above
his
head
raising
his
empty
revolver
with
a
hand
of
iron
struck
his
assailant
full
in
the
face
stretching
him
instantly
at
his
feet
but
scarcely
had
he
accomplished
this
when
three
of
the
bandits
sprang
upon
him
and
hurled
him
to
the
earth
beside
benedetto
now
cried
one
of
the
miscreants
with
a
frightful
curse
at
the
same
time
placing
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
at
the
count
temple
now
my
lord
of
salmis
your
time
has
come
as
he
was
about
to
fire
there
arose
a
tremendous
shout
and
headed
by
ali
who
swung
aloft
a
turkish
yataghan
the
entire
force
of
servants
armed
to
the
teeth
swept
down
upon
the
astonished
bandits
at
the
same
instant
a
rang
out
and
the
man
who
had
threatened
to
take
the
count
life
fell
to
the
ground
a
corpse
as
regained
his
feet
he
saw
espérance
standing
a
short
distance
away
the
smoking
weapon
with
which
he
had
just
killed
his
father
murderer
still
clenched
in
his
boyish
hand
the
struggle
that
ensued
was
of
short
duration
for
the
bandits
finding
themselves
outnumbered
speedily
fled
to
their
boats
leaving
their
wounded
comrades
behind
them
when
the
count
realized
that
espérance
his
beloved
son
had
saved
him
from
death
he
rushed
to
the
heroic
lad
took
him
in
his
arms
and
bore
him
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
this
done
he
returned
to
aid
ali
and
the
servants
but
they
were
already
victors
and
in
full
possession
of
the
field
a
search
was
made
for
the
body
of
benedetto
but
it
had
disappeared
chapter
iii
the
conflagration
as
the
count
of
espérance
ali
and
the
servants
approached
the
palace
on
their
return
from
the
struggle
with
the
bandits
in
the
almond
grove
their
ears
were
suddenly
saluted
by
loud
cries
of
terror
they
came
from
the
library
and
thither
hurried
followed
by
his
son
on
the
floor
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
haydée
lay
in
a
swoon
and
bending
over
her
mother
was
zuleika
screaming
and
wringing
her
little
hands
the
count
raised
his
wife
and
placed
her
upon
a
divan
while
espérance
brought
a
and
bathed
her
temples
with
its
cool
refreshing
contents
zuleika
meanwhile
holding
her
mother
hands
and
sobbing
violently
at
last
haydée
recovered
consciousness
and
opening
her
eyes
gazed
wildly
around
her
seeing
her
husband
espérance
and
zuleika
safe
beside
her
she
uttered
a
faint
sigh
of
relief
it
was
several
moments
longer
before
she
could
speak
then
she
exclaimed
in
a
tremulous
voice
oh
my
lord
did
you
meet
that
terrible
man
what
man
haydée
asked
the
count
do
you
mean
benedetto
i
do
not
know
his
name
i
never
saw
him
before
answered
haydée
but
his
face
was
all
battered
and
bleeding
on
his
uncovered
head
the
locks
were
matted
and
unkempt
and
his
garments
were
torn
as
if
in
wrenching
his
way
through
a
thicket
of
tangled
briers
benedetto
it
was
benedetto
cried
you
do
not
mean
to
say
he
was
here
in
this
room
he
was
here
and
only
a
short
time
ago
replied
haydée
with
a
shudder
i
was
standing
at
the
window
with
zuleika
when
he
rushed
by
me
like
a
whirlwind
and
going
to
your
secretary
endeavored
to
open
it
but
in
vain
then
with
a
cry
of
rage
he
ran
to
the
window
leaped
out
into
the
darkness
and
was
gone
i
know
nothing
further
for
as
he
vanished
i
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
swoon
touched
a
bell
and
almost
immediately
ali
stood
bowing
before
him
as
calm
and
unmoved
as
though
nothing
unusual
had
occurred
ali
said
the
count
post
all
the
servants
within
and
without
the
palace
and
let
the
strictest
watch
be
kept
until
dawn
the
chief
of
the
bandits
who
is
no
other
than
the
former
prince
cavalcanti
was
here
in
our
absence
and
must
yet
be
hovering
in
the
vicinity
see
that
he
does
not
effect
another
entrance
as
his
purpose
is
robbery
if
not
murder
ali
signified
by
his
eloquent
pantomime
that
he
had
already
taken
it
upon
himself
to
station
the
servants
as
his
master
directed
and
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
any
one
to
approach
the
palace
without
being
seen
and
seized
as
the
faithful
nubian
turned
to
retire
noticed
that
his
right
hand
was
bandaged
as
if
wounded
and
inquired
whether
he
had
been
hurt
in
the
conflict
with
the
bandits
ali
explained
that
a
dagger
thrust
had
cut
his
palm
but
that
the
wound
had
been
properly
cared
for
and
would
soon
heal
when
the
count
and
his
family
were
once
more
alone
together
haydée
threw
herself
at
her
husband
feet
and
humbly
demanded
pardon
what
have
you
done
to
require
pardon
asked
in
astonishment
speak
but
i
forgive
you
beforehand
oh
my
lord
said
haydée
still
maintaining
her
kneeling
posture
despite
her
husband
efforts
to
raise
her
oh
my
lord
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
despicable
act
but
my
love
for
you
and
fears
for
your
safety
must
be
my
excuse
you
left
the
letter
you
received
so
strangely
this
morning
lying
upon
your
secretary
i
opened
it
and
hurriedly
made
myself
acquainted
with
its
contents
for
i
had
a
premonition
that
some
terrible
danger
threatened
you
oh
my
lord
pardon
pardon
raised
her
to
her
feet
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
her
pallid
brow
so
then
it
is
to
you
haydée
that
i
owe
my
timely
rescue
from
the
hands
of
benedetto
and
his
band
of
had
you
committed
even
a
much
more
serious
fault
than
peeping
into
my
correspondence
that
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
secure
my
full
forgiveness
but
do
you
know
that
espérance
shot
and
killed
the
miscreant
who
held
his
pistol
to
my
temple
and
was
about
to
blow
out
my
brains
espérance
said
haydée
in
bewilderment
did
he
not
remain
behind
with
zuleika
and
myself
no
mamma
said
the
boy
holding
his
head
proudly
erect
i
could
not
remain
behind
i
knew
papa
was
in
danger
and
taking
a
pistol
that
i
had
seen
ali
load
this
morning
from
the
cabinet
of
i
followed
the
servants
arriving
at
the
almond
grove
just
in
time
haydée
ran
to
her
son
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
pressed
him
fondly
to
her
heart
kissing
him
again
and
again
oh
espérance
she
cried
had
i
known
you
were
in
the
midst
of
those
bloodthirsty
i
should
have
died
of
terror
but
you
have
saved
your
father
life
my
son
and
i
bless
you
for
it
he
is
a
little
hero
said
impressively
zuleika
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
divan
and
utterly
worn
out
by
the
excitement
through
which
she
had
passed
was
already
wrapped
in
a
deep
slumber
the
count
haydée
and
espérance
however
could
not
resign
themselves
to
sleep
and
when
the
gray
light
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
eastern
sky
they
were
still
in
the
library
and
still
watching
benedetto
had
not
been
seen
again
and
a
diligent
search
of
the
entire
island
made
by
ali
and
the
servants
failed
to
reveal
even
the
slightest
trace
of
him
he
had
evidently
succeeded
in
finding
some
fisherman
skiff
and
in
it
had
made
his
escape
this
view
of
the
case
was
confirmed
a
few
hours
later
when
old
alexis
came
to
the
palace
and
informed
that
his
smack
had
vanished
during
the
night
having
in
all
probability
been
carried
off
by
thieves
i
knew
said
the
fisherman
that
the
island
of
kylo
was
infested
by
bandits
but
i
had
no
idea
they
would
venture
here
now
however
i
thought
i
had
better
put
you
on
your
guard
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
alexis
said
the
count
then
slipping
a
purse
of
money
into
his
hand
he
added
take
that
and
provide
yourself
with
a
new
boat
alexis
touched
his
cap
bowed
and
was
about
to
withdraw
when
said
to
him
assuming
a
careless
tone
by
the
way
my
good
fellow
have
you
ever
chanced
to
meet
any
of
the
bandits
you
mentioned
often
excellency
replied
alexis
what
kind
of
men
are
they
bold
bad
wretches
whose
hands
have
been
more
than
once
stained
with
innocent
blood
what
is
their
strength
they
number
about
fifty
do
any
women
dwell
among
them
yes
excellency
their
wives
and
sweethearts
who
is
the
leader
of
the
band
a
strange
morose
man
who
has
not
been
long
in
their
midst
is
he
a
greek
no
excellency
he
is
a
foreigner
a
frenchman
quite
likely
though
i
am
not
sure
what
is
his
name
he
calls
himself
demetrius
did
he
ever
question
you
about
me
yes
excellency
and
what
did
you
reply
i
told
him
you
were
the
count
of
ah
what
did
he
say
then
he
said
he
had
heard
of
you
before
that
will
do
alexis
i
have
all
the
information
i
require
the
fisherman
again
touched
his
cap
and
making
a
low
bow
took
his
departure
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
not
have
been
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
bandits
so
near
the
island
of
salmis
but
it
became
an
altogether
different
thing
when
those
bandits
were
led
by
benedetto
a
month
passed
but
in
it
nothing
occurred
calculated
to
break
the
tranquillity
of
the
count
and
his
family
the
bandits
had
not
reappeared
and
benedetto
had
given
no
sign
of
life
the
faithful
ali
no
longer
deemed
it
necessary
to
maintain
his
precautions
against
surprise
and
the
strict
watch
that
had
been
kept
up
day
and
night
ever
since
the
conflict
in
the
almond
grove
was
abandoned
haydée
zuleika
and
espérance
resumed
their
usual
mode
of
life
having
apparently
dismissed
the
robbers
from
their
minds
while
even
seemed
free
from
all
uneasiness
one
night
while
the
count
was
writing
at
a
late
hour
in
the
library
he
yielded
to
fatigue
and
fell
asleep
over
his
papers
his
slumber
was
troubled
with
a
strange
and
vivid
dream
a
man
in
the
picturesque
garb
of
a
greek
peasant
and
wearing
a
mask
on
his
face
suddenly
stood
before
him
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
saw
him
distinctly
though
unable
to
stir
either
hand
or
foot
the
singular
visitant
surveyed
the
count
long
and
steadily
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
him
but
as
to
his
identity
the
sleeper
could
form
no
idea
at
last
he
slowly
removed
the
mask
and
recognition
was
instantaneous
the
man
was
danglars
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
pointing
with
his
forefinger
at
the
count
said
deliberately
with
a
hiss
like
some
venomous
serpent
edmond
dantès
there
is
a
bitter
account
open
between
us
and
i
am
here
to
force
you
to
a
bitter
settlement
the
light
of
the
huge
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
fell
full
upon
danglars
countenance
it
was
as
bloodless
as
that
of
a
corpse
and
the
eyes
shone
with
a
remorseless
vindictive
glare
the
banker
continued
in
the
same
hissing
tone
his
words
penetrating
to
the
very
marrow
of
the
slumberer
bones
count
of
for
by
that
name
it
still
pleases
you
to
be
called
listen
to
me
by
the
most
ingenious
and
fiendish
combinations
possible
for
a
human
being
to
contrive
you
wrecked
my
fortune
and
with
it
my
hopes
you
drove
me
ignominiously
from
paris
in
rome
you
caused
me
to
be
starved
and
robbed
by
luigi
vampa
and
his
brigands
then
with
the
malevolent
magnanimity
of
an
you
sent
me
forth
into
the
world
a
fugitive
and
an
outcast
count
of
edmond
dantès
sailor
of
marseilles
modern
mephistopheles
as
you
are
i
will
be
even
with
you
you
have
had
your
vengeance
now
you
shall
feel
mine
here
in
the
grecian
archipelago
on
the
island
of
salmis
i
will
torture
you
through
your
dearest
affections
and
grind
you
to
dust
beneath
my
heel
as
danglars
finished
his
features
changed
and
became
those
of
villefort
while
his
greek
peasant
garb
was
transformed
into
the
sombre
habiliments
of
the
procureur
du
roi
villefort
face
wore
the
look
of
madness
but
there
was
a
freezing
calmness
in
his
voice
as
he
said
edmond
dantès
count
of
gaze
upon
the
ruin
you
have
made
through
you
i
was
dragged
down
from
my
high
position
exposed
humiliated
and
deprived
of
reason
but
although
the
mere
wreck
of
my
former
self
i
am
not
utterly
powerless
as
you
shall
learn
to
your
cost
you
raised
up
my
infamous
son
benedetto
to
be
the
instrument
of
my
destruction
now
he
shall
work
yours
and
avenge
his
unhappy
father
the
apparition
paused
sighed
deeply
and
then
resumed
in
a
tone
of
still
greater
menace
count
of
look
well
to
your
beloved
wife
haydée
look
well
to
your
heroic
son
espérance
look
well
to
your
darling
daughter
zuleika
for
this
night
they
are
in
frightful
danger
look
well
to
your
fabulous
riches
for
they
are
threatened
look
well
to
your
stately
and
magnificent
palace
for
already
the
element
that
shall
devour
it
is
noiselessly
and
stealthily
at
work
count
of
farewell
a
shriek
rang
in
the
sleeper
ears
a
mighty
flash
dazzled
his
eyes
and
with
a
grim
smile
upon
his
pallid
countenance
villefort
vanished
awoke
with
a
quick
start
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
if
dazed
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
glanced
breathlessly
about
him
danglars
and
villefort
had
been
only
the
idle
coinage
of
his
brain
but
the
shriek
the
mighty
flash
they
were
indeed
stern
realities
the
shriek
was
haydée
and
the
flash
was
fire
my
god
cried
standing
for
an
instant
rooted
to
the
spot
can
it
be
possible
that
this
dream
is
the
truth
after
all
and
that
i
am
even
now
to
feel
the
vengeance
of
those
two
men
he
sprang
into
the
spacious
hall
that
was
as
light
as
day
and
as
he
did
so
the
figure
of
a
man
rushed
by
him
it
was
benedetto
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
long
knife
dripping
with
blood
the
count
turned
and
pursued
him
snatching
a
dagger
from
a
table
as
he
ran
at
the
door
leading
to
the
lawn
he
grasped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulder
and
held
him
murderer
he
shouted
whose
blood
is
that
upon
your
knife
the
blood
of
haydée
the
greek
slave
hissed
benedetto
with
a
glare
of
ferocious
triumph
the
blood
of
haydée
your
wife
edmond
dantès
i
am
even
with
you
struck
at
the
assassin
with
his
dagger
but
benedetto
eluded
the
blow
and
raising
his
own
weapon
inflicted
a
frightful
gash
upon
the
count
cheek
a
terrible
struggle
ensued
was
possessed
of
wonderful
strength
and
activity
but
in
both
these
respects
the
two
desperate
antagonists
seemed
fairly
matched
three
times
did
the
count
bury
his
dagger
in
benedetto
body
but
though
the
assassin
blood
gushed
copiously
from
his
wounds
he
continued
to
fight
with
the
utmost
determination
at
length
the
men
grappled
in
a
supreme
deadly
effort
but
making
a
false
step
slipped
on
the
marble
floor
and
benedetto
with
the
quickness
of
thought
hurling
him
backward
freed
himself
and
bounding
through
the
open
doorway
vanished
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
count
uttered
a
groan
of
despair
as
he
saw
haydée
murderer
escape
him
and
staggered
to
his
feet
the
fierce
conflict
with
benedetto
had
exhausted
him
and
he
stood
for
an
instant
panting
and
breathless
the
shrieks
had
now
grown
fainter
and
the
hall
was
full
of
smoke
during
all
this
time
neither
ali
nor
any
of
the
servants
under
him
had
appeared
a
circumstance
that
to
seemed
inexplicable
he
however
did
not
pause
to
give
it
thought
but
dashed
up
the
stairway
and
strove
to
reach
his
wife
apartment
blinding
stifling
clouds
of
smoke
through
which
penetrated
the
glare
of
the
conflagration
drove
him
back
again
and
again
but
he
renewed
his
attempts
to
force
a
passage
with
undaunted
energy
and
courage
finally
compressing
his
lips
and
holding
his
nostrils
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
he
gave
a
headlong
plunge
and
succeeded
in
reaching
haydée
door
it
was
open
displaying
a
scene
that
caused
the
count
heart
to
sink
within
him
the
whole
chamber
was
one
sea
of
flame
fiery
tongues
like
so
many
writhing
and
hissing
serpents
were
licking
and
consuming
the
costly
tapestry
the
richly
carved
furniture
and
the
magnificent
objects
of
art
the
curtains
of
the
bed
were
blazing
and
upon
the
couch
lay
the
senseless
form
of
the
wife
of
the
pallor
of
her
faultless
countenance
contrasting
painfully
with
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
devouring
element
in
breast
was
a
gaping
wound
from
which
her
life
blood
was
slowly
oozing
in
ruby
drops
rendered
utterly
reckless
by
the
terrible
sight
the
count
madly
rushed
to
the
couch
tore
his
beloved
haydée
from
it
and
clasping
her
tightly
against
his
bosom
staggered
into
the
corridor
with
his
precious
burden
there
the
smoke
had
increased
in
volume
and
density
but
summoning
all
his
resolution
and
endurance
to
his
aid
he
plunged
through
it
and
finally
was
successful
in
reaching
the
library
then
with
the
swiftness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
the
husband
was
replaced
by
the
father
and
for
the
first
time
since
haydée
shrieks
had
awakened
him
from
his
dream
thought
of
his
children
where
were
they
and
what
had
happened
to
them
the
count
felt
a
cold
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
forehead
and
a
feeling
of
unspeakable
dread
took
entire
possession
of
him
haydée
demanded
immediate
attention
but
espérance
and
zuleika
must
instantly
be
found
and
rescued
at
the
top
of
his
voice
shouted
for
ali
but
no
reply
was
returned
fearing
to
leave
haydée
for
even
a
moment
the
count
strode
about
the
library
like
a
caged
wild
animal
still
holding
her
in
his
arms
he
shouted
again
and
again
until
he
was
hoarse
calling
distractedly
upon
espérance
zuleika
and
all
the
servants
in
turn
at
last
an
answering
shout
came
suddenly
from
the
lawn
and
old
alexis
followed
by
several
fishermen
leaped
into
the
library
through
an
open
window
resigning
haydée
to
alexis
the
count
accompanied
by
the
fishermen
fairly
flew
to
the
apartment
of
his
children
situated
on
a
corridor
in
another
portion
of
the
palace
there
espérance
and
zuleika
were
discovered
gagged
and
bound
they
lay
upon
the
floor
of
their
chamber
while
ali
who
had
been
treated
in
like
manner
was
extended
near
them
to
release
the
prisoners
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
and
then
it
was
learned
that
all
the
servants
under
ali
were
confined
in
their
dormitory
they
as
well
as
children
and
the
nubian
had
been
suddenly
seized
by
a
party
of
greeks
evidently
a
portion
of
benedetto
band
meanwhile
the
flames
had
spread
from
haydée
chamber
to
the
adjoining
quarters
of
the
edifice
and
the
entire
palace
seemed
doomed
for
to
check
the
conflagration
appeared
impossible
but
so
happy
had
the
count
been
made
by
the
recovery
of
his
son
and
daughter
unharmed
that
he
gave
himself
no
concern
about
the
probable
destruction
of
his
magnificent
property
seizing
his
children
he
directed
ali
and
the
fishermen
to
release
the
captive
servants
and
hastily
returned
to
the
library
as
he
entered
the
room
haydée
uttered
a
low
groan
and
opened
her
eyes
she
was
lying
on
a
divan
where
old
alexis
had
placed
her
espérance
and
zuleika
sprang
to
her
side
she
took
each
by
the
hand
and
as
she
did
so
they
saw
the
wound
in
her
breast
zuleika
burst
into
tears
espérance
compressed
his
lips
and
grew
deadly
pale
my
loved
ones
said
haydée
faintly
i
feel
that
i
am
about
to
leave
you
forever
perhaps
in
a
few
moments
be
good
children
and
obey
your
father
in
all
things
espérance
zuleika
stoop
and
kiss
me
they
did
as
she
desired
her
lips
were
already
purple
and
cold
the
stamp
of
death
was
upon
her
features
suddenly
her
frame
was
convulsed
and
her
eyes
assumed
a
glassy
look
my
husband
where
are
you
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
here
haydée
answered
the
count
approaching
he
strove
to
appear
calm
but
could
not
control
his
emotion
nearer
nearer
edmond
said
haydée
growing
weaker
and
weaker
the
count
sank
on
his
knees
beside
his
dying
wife
and
put
his
arms
about
her
neck
oh
haydée
haydée
he
sobbed
thrice
accursed
be
the
infamous
wretch
who
has
done
this
edmond
my
children
farewell
gasped
haydée
i
am
going
to
a
better
land
the
death
rattle
was
in
her
throat
she
raised
herself
with
a
mighty
effort
gazed
lovingly
at
her
husband
and
children
and
strove
to
speak
again
but
could
not
then
a
flickering
shade
of
violet
passed
over
her
countenance
and
she
fell
back
dead
espérance
and
zuleika
stood
as
if
stunned
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
despair
the
whole
palace
is
in
flames
save
yourselves
save
yourselves
cried
a
fisherman
rushing
into
the
library
followed
by
his
companions
ali
and
the
servants
leaped
to
his
feet
seizing
the
corpse
of
haydée
and
raising
it
in
his
arms
ali
grasped
espérance
and
zuleika
and
the
entire
party
hastened
from
the
burning
edifice
they
were
not
an
instant
too
soon
for
as
they
quitted
the
library
the
tempest
of
fire
burst
into
it
accompanied
by
torrents
of
smoke
the
fishermen
and
servants
commanded
by
the
nubian
had
made
every
effort
to
save
the
doomed
mansion
but
in
vain
and
his
children
found
refuge
in
the
hut
of
alexis
to
which
haydée
body
was
reverently
borne
the
wife
of
was
buried
on
the
island
of
salmis
and
over
her
remains
her
husband
erected
a
massive
monument
shortly
afterwards
the
count
espérance
and
zuleika
attended
by
the
faithful
ali
quitted
the
island
and
took
passage
on
a
vessel
bound
for
france
chapter
iv
the
news
from
algeria
beauchamp
the
journalist
sat
at
his
desk
in
his
editorial
sanctum
early
one
bright
morning
in
the
autumn
of
he
had
gone
to
work
long
before
his
usual
hour
for
important
movements
were
on
foot
the
political
atmosphere
was
agitated
and
paris
was
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
besides
beauchamp
had
that
day
printed
in
his
journal
a
dispatch
from
algeria
that
would
be
certain
to
cause
a
great
sensation
and
with
the
proper
spirit
of
pride
the
journalist
desired
to
be
at
his
post
that
he
might
receive
the
numerous
congratulations
his
friends
could
not
fail
to
offer
as
the
dispatch
had
appeared
in
his
paper
alone
the
sanctum
had
not
an
attractive
look
in
fact
it
was
rather
dilapidated
while
in
addition
the
disorder
occasioned
by
the
previous
night
work
had
not
been
repaired
and
all
was
chaos
and
confusion
beauchamp
was
busily
engaged
in
glancing
over
the
rival
morning
papers
when
lucien
debray
entered
and
seated
himself
at
another
desk
the
ministerial
secretary
smiled
upon
the
journalist
in
a
knowing
way
and
the
latter
nodding
to
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
silently
pointed
to
the
pile
of
journals
he
had
finished
examining
lucien
took
them
up
and
without
a
word
began
scanning
their
contents
glorious
news
that
from
the
army
in
algeria
cried
rushing
into
the
sanctum
glorious
indeed
replied
the
editor
looking
up
from
the
paper
over
which
he
was
hurriedly
skimming
on
the
huge
table
at
his
side
as
well
as
beneath
it
and
under
his
feet
and
his
capacious
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
newspapers
take
a
chair
renaud
if
you
can
find
one
and
help
yourself
to
the
news
you
see
i
have
lucien
similarly
engaged
yonder
the
ministerial
secretary
glanced
up
from
his
papers
returned
his
friend
salutation
and
resumed
his
reading
he
was
dressed
with
his
customary
elegance
and
richness
but
his
form
and
face
were
fuller
than
when
last
before
the
reader
and
his
brown
hair
was
besprinkled
with
gray
i
congratulate
you
beauchamp
on
being
the
first
to
give
the
news
continued
not
a
paper
in
paris
but
your
own
has
a
line
from
the
army
this
morning
rather
congratulate
me
and
my
paper
on
having
a
friend
at
court
ha
and
that
explains
the
fact
otherwise
inexplicable
that
an
opposition
journal
has
intelligence
which
only
the
bureau
of
war
could
have
anticipated
treason
treason
the
editor
and
the
secretary
exchanged
significant
smiles
oh
i
do
doubt
that
your
favors
are
reciprocal
continued
the
young
aristocrat
laughing
i
half
a
mind
to
be
something
useful
myself
minister
editor
anything
but
an
idler
and
a
just
to
experience
the
exquisite
sensation
of
a
new
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
revealing
and
publishing
to
the
world
something
it
knew
not
before
why
you
two
fellows
in
this
dark
and
dirty
little
room
are
the
two
greatest
men
in
paris
this
morning
or
were
rather
before
your
paper
beauchamp
laid
before
the
world
what
only
you
and
lucien
knew
previously
oh
the
delight
the
rapture
of
knowing
something
that
nobody
else
knows
and
then
of
making
the
revelation
and
this
news
from
algeria
is
really
important
remarked
the
editor
important
so
important
that
it
will
be
before
the
chambers
this
morning
replied
the
secretary
so
i
supposed
said
the
deputy
and
called
to
learn
additional
particulars
if
you
had
any
on
my
way
to
the
chambers
we
gave
all
we
had
my
dear
lycurgus
and
for
that
were
indebted
to
an
official
dispatch
telegraphed
to
the
war
office
and
faithfully
to
us
by
our
lucien
it
true
then
as
i
have
sometimes
suspected
that
the
wires
radiate
from
the
minister
sanctum
to
the
editor
was
the
laughing
rejoinder
it
must
be
so
or
there
witchcraft
in
it
there
witchcraft
at
any
rate
in
this
new
invention
speed
secrecy
security
and
surety
no
eastern
genius
of
arabian
fiction
can
be
compared
to
the
electric
telegraph
and
how
ministers
or
editors
continued
to
keep
the
world
in
vassalage
as
they
always
have
done
without
this
ready
slave
seems
now
scarce
less
wonderful
than
the
invention
itself
instead
of
detracting
from
the
power
of
the
press
the
telegraph
renders
it
more
powerful
than
ever
but
affairs
in
algeria
is
not
the
news
splendid
cried
the
editor
why
did
we
not
all
become
spahis
and
win
immortality
as
some
of
our
generals
have
as
to
immortality
said
the
secretary
we
should
have
been
far
more
likely
to
win
the
phantom
as
dead
men
than
as
living
heroes
debray
was
at
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
constantine
said
beauchamp
laughing
and
knows
all
about
the
honors
of
war
yes
indeed
and
all
about
the
raptures
of
starvation
of
cold
and
hunger
after
victory
and
the
ecstatic
felicity
of
being
pursued
by
six
bedouins
and
after
having
slain
five
having
my
own
neck
encircled
by
the
yataghan
of
the
sixth
and
how
chanced
it
that
you
saved
your
head
lucien
asked
the
count
save
it
i
did
save
it
but
a
most
excellent
friend
of
mine
a
friend
in
need
galloped
up
and
saved
it
for
me
yes
replied
beauchamp
our
gallant
friend
maximilian
morrel
the
captain
of
spahis
now
colonel
of
a
regiment
and
in
the
direct
line
of
promotion
to
the
first
vacant
bâton
eh
lucien
a
lucky
thing
to
save
the
head
of
one
of
the
war
office
from
a
bedouin
yataghan
up
up
up
like
a
balloon
has
this
young
spahi
risen
ever
since
you
are
wrong
beauchamp
not
like
a
balloon
rather
like
a
planet
maximilian
morrel
is
one
of
the
most
gallant
young
men
in
the
french
army
and
step
by
step
from
rank
to
rank
has
he
hewn
his
own
path
with
his
good
sabre
in
a
strong
hand
nerved
by
a
brave
heart
and
proud
ambition
to
the
position
he
now
holds
his
name
i
see
among
the
immortals
in
the
dispatch
of
this
morning
well
well
morrel
is
a
splendid
fellow
no
doubt
but
it
a
splendid
thing
to
have
friends
in
the
war
office
nevertheless
who
will
give
that
splendor
a
chance
to
shine
will
plant
the
lighted
candle
in
a
candlestick
and
not
smother
its
beams
under
a
bushel
morrel
has
now
been
in
africa
five
whole
years
said
the
secretary
a
few
months
only
excepted
after
his
marriage
with
villefort
fair
daughter
valentine
as
was
said
when
he
was
indulged
with
a
furlough
for
his
honeymoon
she
is
not
in
paris
asked
beauchamp
no
she
leads
the
life
of
a
perfect
recluse
with
her
child
during
her
husband
absence
at
his
villa
somewhere
in
the
south
near
marseilles
where
the
department
forwards
her
letters
yet
she
is
said
to
be
a
magnificent
woman
remarked
the
count
wonderful
cried
beauchamp
a
magnificent
woman
and
a
recluse
oh
but
it
was
a
of
the
most
devoted
species
you
must
remember
true
she
was
to
have
married
our
friend
franz
and
died
to
save
herself
from
that
fate
i
suppose
and
afterwards
was
resurrected
and
blessed
morrel
with
her
hand
and
heart
and
the
most
exquisite
person
that
even
a
jaded
voluptuary
could
covet
happy
happy
happy
man
apropos
of
dying
said
the
secretary
do
you
remember
how
fast
people
died
at
de
villefort
house
about
that
time
horrible
a
whole
family
of
two
or
three
generations
one
after
the
other
first
and
madame
de
then
barrois
the
old
servant
of
noirtier
then
valentine
and
last
of
all
madame
de
villefort
and
edward
her
idol
no
wonder
that
le
procureur
du
roi
himself
went
mad
under
such
an
accumulation
of
horrors
by
the
by
debray
is
de
villefort
still
an
inmate
of
the
maison
royale
de
charenton
i
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
replied
the
secretary
who
had
resumed
his
paper
and
to
whom
the
subject
seemed
not
altogether
agreeable
he
is
an
incurable
then
as
if
to
turn
the
subject
he
continued
apropos
of
the
immortals
of
algeria
here
is
a
name
that
seems
destined
even
to
a
more
rapid
apotheosis
than
that
of
the
favored
morrel
you
mean
joliette
said
the
editor
who
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
mysterious
and
heroic
is
this
same
joliette
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
discover
with
all
the
means
at
the
command
of
the
press
and
i
with
all
the
means
at
the
command
of
the
government
all
we
can
discover
is
this
that
he
is
a
man
of
about
that
he
enlisted
at
marseilles
and
in
less
than
three
years
has
risen
from
the
ranks
to
the
command
of
a
battalion
his
career
has
been
most
brilliant
and
to
whose
favor
does
he
owe
his
wonderful
advancement
beauchamp
asked
the
deputy
laughing
to
that
of
marshal
bugeaud
of
algeria
ah
who
has
indulged
him
with
an
appointment
in
every
forlorn
hope
excellent
cried
the
count
what
more
could
a
man
resolved
to
be
a
military
immortal
desire
immortality
the
goal
two
paths
conduct
to
it
each
sure
death
life
the
former
the
shorter
and
perhaps
the
surer
but
there
is
one
name
i
never
see
in
the
war
dispatches
do
you
ever
meet
with
it
editor
and
secretary
i
mean
the
name
of
our
brilliant
friend
albert
de
morcerf
the
rumor
ran
that
after
the
disgrace
and
suicide
of
the
count
his
father
he
and
his
mother
went
south
and
he
later
to
africa
i
have
hardly
seen
the
name
of
morcerf
in
print
since
the
paragraph
headed
in
my
paper
about
which
poor
albert
was
so
anxious
to
fight
me
nor
i
said
debray
but
where
now
is
madame
de
morcerf
without
exception
she
was
the
most
splendid
specimen
of
a
woman
i
ever
saw
high
praise
that
cried
the
count
laughing
who
would
suppose
our
cold
calculating
ambitious
haughty
talented
and
opulent
diplomat
and
aristocrat
had
so
much
blood
in
his
veins
when
before
was
he
known
to
admire
anything
male
or
female
but
himself
or
at
all
events
to
be
guilty
of
the
bad
taste
of
expressing
that
admiration
debray
is
right
replied
the
journalist
somewhat
gravely
madame
de
morcerf
was
indeed
a
noble
and
dignified
woman
accomplished
lovely
dignified
amiable
stop
stop
in
the
name
of
all
that
forbearing
be
considerate
of
my
weak
nerves
you
too
beauchamp
well
she
must
have
been
a
paragon
to
make
the
conquest
of
two
of
the
most
inveterate
bachelors
in
all
paris
but
where
is
this
marvel
of
excellence
pardon
me
beauchamp
perceiving
that
the
journalist
looked
yet
more
grave
and
seemed
in
no
mood
for
bantering
or
being
bantered
where
is
madame
de
morcerf
at
the
present
time
at
marseilles
i
have
heard
and
is
married
again
no
she
is
yet
a
widow
and
is
a
recluse
like
morrel
beautiful
wife
so
says
report
they
dwell
together
how
romantic
the
young
wife
whose
is
winning
glory
amid
the
perils
of
war
and
pestilence
pours
her
griefs
joys
and
anticipations
into
the
bosom
of
the
young
mother
who
appreciates
and
reciprocates
all
because
she
has
a
son
exposed
to
the
same
perils
and
both
beautiful
as
the
morning
a
charming
picture
two
immortals
in
epaulets
and
sashes
in
the
background
are
only
wanted
instead
of
one
but
i
must
to
the
chambers
dantès
is
expected
to
speak
in
the
tribune
this
morning
upon
his
measure
for
the
workmen
do
you
know
count
who
this
dantès
really
is
asked
debray
there
a
question
for
a
ministerial
secretary
to
ask
a
member
while
a
journalist
sits
by
i
only
know
of
dantès
that
he
is
the
most
eloquent
man
i
ever
listened
to
i
do
mean
that
he
the
greatest
man
or
the
profoundest
statesman
or
the
wisest
politician
or
the
sagest
political
economist
but
i
do
mean
that
for
natural
powers
of
persuasion
and
denunciation
for
natural
oratory
i
have
never
known
his
rival
if
plato
maxim
oratory
must
be
estimated
by
its
effects
is
at
all
correct
then
is
dantès
the
greatest
orator
in
france
for
the
effect
of
his
oratory
is
miraculous
there
is
a
sort
of
magic
in
his
clear
sonorous
powerful
yet
most
exquisitely
modulated
voice
and
the
wave
of
his
arm
is
like
that
of
a
necromancer
wand
you
are
enthusiastic
count
observed
beauchamp
but
very
just
dantès
is
indeed
a
remarkable
man
and
possessed
of
remarkable
endowments
both
of
mind
and
body
his
personal
advantages
are
wonderful
such
a
figure
and
grace
as
his
are
alone
worth
more
than
all
the
powers
of
other
distinguished
speakers
for
popular
effect
eyes
of
the
multitude
are
more
eloquent
than
their
ears
as
the
english
shakespeare
says
i
never
saw
such
eyes
and
such
a
face
remarked
debray
but
once
in
my
life
do
you
remember
the
count
of
messieurs
we
shall
not
soon
forget
him
was
the
reply
but
this
man
differs
greatly
from
the
count
in
most
respects
though
certainly
not
unlike
him
in
others
true
replied
the
secretary
in
manners
habits
costume
and
a
thousand
other
things
there
is
a
marked
difference
besides
the
count
was
said
to
be
incalculably
rich
while
the
deputy
has
every
appearance
of
being
in
very
moderate
circumstances
but
he
leads
a
life
so
retired
that
he
is
known
only
in
the
chambers
and
in
his
public
character
i
allude
to
the
deputy
person
when
i
speak
of
resemblance
to
that
wonderful
count
who
set
all
paris
in
a
fever
and
more
wonderful
still
kept
it
so
for
a
whole
season
there
is
i
know
not
what
in
his
air
and
manners
that
often
recalls
to
me
that
extraordinary
man
there
are
the
same
large
and
powerful
eyes
the
same
brilliant
teeth
for
which
the
women
envied
the
count
so
much
the
same
graceful
and
dignified
figure
the
same
peculiar
voice
the
same
good
taste
in
dress
and
above
all
the
same
colorless
pallid
face
as
if
to
borrow
the
idea
of
the
countess
of
g
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
or
was
a
visitant
from
another
world
or
a
vampire
of
this
her
celebrated
friend
lord
b
she
used
to
say
was
the
only
man
she
ever
knew
with
such
a
complexion
but
if
i
recollect
rightly
said
beauchamp
the
count
of
was
somewhat
noted
for
his
profusion
of
black
hair
and
beard
the
deputy
dantès
is
so
utterly
out
of
the
mode
and
out
of
good
taste
too
as
to
wear
no
beard
and
his
hair
is
short
his
face
is
as
smooth
as
a
woman
and
he
always
wears
a
white
cravat
like
a
curé
but
he
is
nevertheless
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
paris
added
the
count
at
least
the
women
say
so
you
might
add
the
deputy
has
many
gray
hairs
among
his
black
ones
and
many
furrows
on
his
white
brow
while
had
neither
besides
dantès
has
a
handsome
daughter
and
a
son
who
resembles
him
greatly
both
well
grown
while
the
count
was
childless
well
well
be
his
person
and
family
what
they
may
said
the
secretary
rising
i
wish
to
god
the
ministry
could
secure
his
talents
i
tell
you
messieurs
that
man
influence
over
the
destinies
of
france
is
to
be
almost
omnipotent
his
powerful
mind
has
grasped
the
great
problem
of
the
age
remuneration
for
labor
the
next
revolution
in
france
will
hinge
upon
that
mark
the
prediction
and
this
man
and
his
coadjutors
among
whom
beauchamp
here
is
one
are
doing
all
they
can
to
hasten
the
crisis
the
whole
soul
of
this
remarkable
man
seems
devoted
to
the
elevation
of
the
masses
the
laboring
classes
the
people
and
to
the
amelioration
of
their
condition
his
efforts
and
those
of
all
like
him
can
not
ultimately
succeed
but
they
will
have
a
temporary
triumph
and
the
streets
of
paris
will
run
with
blood
these
men
are
rousing
terrible
agencies
they
are
evoking
the
fiends
of
hunger
and
misery
which
will
neither
obey
them
nor
lie
down
at
their
bidding
and
the
magicians
who
have
summoned
these
foul
fiends
will
prove
their
earliest
victims
said
in
some
excitement
messieurs
listen
a
moment
cried
beauchamp
rising
pardon
me
but
this
discussion
must
cease
at
least
here
it
can
lead
to
no
good
result
as
the
conductor
of
a
reform
journal
i
entirely
differ
with
you
both
but
let
not
political
differences
interfere
with
our
personal
friendship
come
come
old
friends
let
us
forsake
this
place
redolent
with
politics
having
a
very
atmosphere
of
discussion
and
repair
to
the
chambers
taking
véry
on
our
way
agreed
cried
the
deputy
and
the
secretary
and
the
three
left
the
journalist
sanctum
arm
in
arm
chapter
edmond
dantès
deputy
from
marseilles
beauchamp
lucien
debray
and
were
not
the
only
persons
puzzled
with
regard
to
the
enigmatical
dantès
all
paris
was
more
or
less
bothered
about
him
his
entire
career
prior
to
his
appearance
at
the
capital
as
the
deputy
from
marseilles
seemed
shrouded
in
impenetrable
mystery
and
this
was
the
more
galling
to
the
curious
parisians
as
his
wonderful
oratorical
powers
and
his
intense
republicanism
rendered
him
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
and
made
him
the
sensation
of
the
hour
the
government
had
instituted
investigations
concerning
him
but
without
result
even
in
marseilles
his
antecedents
were
unknown
he
had
come
there
from
the
east
utterly
unheralded
attended
only
by
a
black
servant
and
bringing
with
him
his
son
and
daughter
but
almost
immediately
he
had
plunged
into
politics
winning
his
way
to
the
front
with
startling
rapidity
from
the
first
he
had
ardently
espoused
the
cause
of
the
working
people
and
such
was
his
personal
magnetism
that
he
had
made
hosts
of
admirers
and
had
been
chosen
deputy
with
hardly
a
dissenting
voice
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
marseilles
indeed
remembered
a
youthful
sailor
named
edmond
dantès
but
they
asserted
that
he
had
been
dead
many
years
and
that
the
deputy
was
unlike
him
in
every
particular
as
the
young
men
passed
the
théâtre
français
on
their
way
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
after
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
at
véry
their
attention
was
attracted
by
a
crowd
gathered
around
an
immense
poster
spread
upon
the
there
seemed
no
little
excitement
among
the
throng
a
large
proportion
of
whom
appeared
to
be
artisans
and
laborers
and
loud
expressions
of
admiration
accompanied
by
animated
gestures
were
heard
nor
were
there
wanting
also
words
of
deep
denunciation
and
of
significant
threatening
down
down
with
the
tyrants
bread
or
blood
wages
for
work
food
for
the
laborer
and
other
cries
of
equally
fearful
significance
were
audible
do
you
hear
that
beauchamp
said
debray
quietly
undoubtedly
was
the
equally
quiet
reply
those
laborers
have
deserted
the
daily
toil
which
would
give
them
the
bread
they
so
fiercely
demand
in
order
to
discuss
their
imaginary
misery
and
denounce
those
who
are
richer
than
themselves
but
what
brings
them
to
the
theatre
at
this
hour
asked
the
new
play
suggested
beauchamp
ah
the
new
play
laborer
of
lyons
is
it
not
yes
said
debray
and
one
of
the
most
dangerous
productions
of
the
hour
it
is
evidently
from
the
pen
of
one
unaccustomed
to
dramatic
composition
yet
familiar
with
stage
effect
added
the
journalist
and
yet
without
the
least
claptrap
with
but
little
melodramatic
power
against
strong
opposition
and
bitter
prejudices
and
without
claqueurs
its
own
native
force
and
the
popularity
of
the
principles
it
supports
have
carried
it
triumphantly
through
the
ordeal
of
two
representations
it
will
doubtless
have
a
long
run
and
its
influence
will
be
incalculable
in
the
cause
it
advocates
the
cause
of
human
liberty
and
human
right
no
doubt
it
will
exert
a
most
baneful
influence
bitterly
rejoined
debray
without
containing
a
syllable
to
which
the
ministry
can
object
at
least
sufficiently
to
warrant
its
suppression
it
yet
abounds
with
principles
sentiments
and
theories
of
the
most
incendiary
description
well
calculated
to
rouse
the
disaffection
of
the
laboring
classes
to
frenzy
its
inevitable
effect
will
be
to
give
them
a
false
and
exaggerated
idea
of
their
wrongs
and
their
rights
and
to
stimulate
them
to
revolution
oh
these
men
have
much
to
answer
for
they
are
drawing
down
an
avalanche
they
are
the
champions
of
human
liberty
said
beauchamp
warmly
and
will
be
blessed
by
posterity
if
not
by
the
men
of
the
present
generation
truce
to
politics
messieurs
cried
the
deputy
observing
that
his
friends
were
becoming
excited
i
had
heard
of
this
play
and
its
powerful
character
who
the
author
beauchamp
the
production
is
attributed
to
dantès
the
deputy
from
marseilles
with
what
truth
i
know
not
but
he
is
fully
capable
of
composing
such
a
drama
night
it
is
supposed
the
author
whoever
he
may
be
will
be
compelled
by
the
people
to
appear
and
claim
the
laurels
ready
to
be
showered
on
him
in
such
profusion
but
it
is
nearly
three
continued
beauchamp
and
dantès
is
expected
to
speak
in
the
early
part
of
the
sitting
to
the
chamber
then
said
the
others
and
the
trio
mingled
with
the
crowd
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
what
a
glorious
thing
is
popularity
exclaimed
the
count
what
a
glorious
thing
to
be
the
champion
of
the
people
rejoined
beauchamp
and
how
glorious
is
that
champion
glorious
career
cried
the
secretary
let
the
hydra
alone
like
the
antique
god
of
mythology
it
eats
up
its
own
children
as
soon
as
they
get
large
enough
to
be
eaten
it
is
a
fickle
beast
and
the
idol
of
it
crushes
the
hall
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
was
crowded
when
the
three
friends
entered
although
the
hour
for
the
president
to
take
the
chair
had
not
yet
arrived
the
benches
were
full
and
the
galleries
public
and
private
were
overflowing
strong
agitation
was
visible
among
the
ministerial
benches
of
the
extreme
left
the
premier
himself
was
present
although
his
cold
countenance
like
the
surface
of
a
frozen
lake
betrayed
neither
apprehension
nor
the
reverse
calm
seemingly
insensible
to
surrounding
objects
and
events
this
man
of
iron
with
a
heart
of
ice
and
a
brain
of
fire
glanced
quietly
and
fixedly
around
him
with
his
cold
dark
eye
which
from
time
to
time
rested
on
the
communist
benches
of
the
extreme
right
unmoved
by
the
stern
glances
hurled
at
him
by
his
many
fierce
opponents
and
the
almost
tumultuous
excitement
by
which
they
were
agitated
at
length
president
sauzet
took
the
chair
the
house
came
to
order
and
the
sitting
opened
with
the
usual
preliminary
business
a
large
number
of
petitions
from
the
workmen
of
paris
for
employment
by
the
government
were
presented
and
referred
and
one
immense
roll
containing
a
hundred
thousand
names
which
came
from
the
manufacturing
districts
was
brought
in
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
and
placed
in
the
area
before
the
president
chair
escorted
by
a
deputation
from
the
artisans
it
was
received
with
an
uproar
of
applause
from
the
centre
of
the
extreme
right
of
the
benches
and
from
the
throngs
of
blouses
in
the
galleries
the
tumult
having
at
length
subsided
the
order
of
the
day
was
announced
to
be
the
discussion
of
the
bill
introduced
by
dantès
having
for
its
purpose
the
general
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
industrial
classes
in
the
kingdom
and
dantès
was
himself
announced
to
be
the
first
on
the
list
to
occupy
the
tribune
a
deep
murmur
of
anticipation
ran
around
the
vast
hall
at
this
announcement
the
multitudes
in
the
galleries
leaned
forward
to
gain
a
better
view
of
this
idol
and
to
catch
every
syllable
that
might
fall
from
his
lips
and
every
eye
among
the
members
was
turned
to
the
seat
of
dantès
on
the
centre
right
of
the
benches
a
tall
figure
in
black
with
a
white
cravat
rose
and
advanced
to
the
tribune
slowly
amid
a
stillness
as
hushed
and
breathless
as
the
prior
excitement
had
been
noisy
in
age
dantès
seemed
about
fifty
or
his
form
was
slight
and
his
movements
were
graceful
and
dignified
his
face
was
livid
and
as
calm
as
marble
but
for
the
large
and
eloquent
eye
dark
as
night
one
might
have
thought
that
broad
white
brow
that
massive
chin
those
firmly
compressed
lips
and
that
colorless
mouth
were
those
of
a
statue
yet
in
the
furrows
of
that
forehead
and
the
deep
lines
of
that
face
could
be
read
the
record
of
thought
and
suffering
the
busy
plowshare
had
turned
up
the
deep
graves
of
departed
passions
no
one
could
gaze
or
even
glance
at
that
face
and
not
perceive
at
once
that
it
was
the
visage
of
a
man
of
many
sorrows
yet
of
a
man
proud
calm
and
indomitable
his
hair
which
had
been
raven
black
now
rested
in
thin
waves
around
his
expansive
forehead
and
was
sprinkled
with
gray
while
his
intellectual
countenance
wore
that
expression
of
weariness
and
melancholy
which
illness
deep
study
and
grief
invariably
trace
mounting
the
steps
of
the
tribune
with
slow
and
deliberate
tread
he
drew
up
his
tall
figure
and
resting
his
left
hand
which
grasped
a
roll
of
papers
upon
the
marble
slab
glanced
around
on
the
turbulent
billows
of
upturned
and
excited
faces
as
if
at
a
loss
how
to
address
them
having
read
the
bill
after
the
usual
prefatory
remarks
he
began
by
laying
down
the
platform
which
he
proposed
occupying
in
its
advocacy
and
support
consisting
of
course
of
abstract
propositions
which
none
could
have
the
hardihood
to
gainsay
yet
when
once
admitted
the
deductions
inevitably
flowing
therefrom
none
could
resist
the
propositions
seemed
safe
and
indisputable
but
the
deductions
evolved
from
those
propositions
were
as
frightful
to
the
legitimist
as
they
were
delightful
to
the
liberal
that
each
man
is
born
the
heir
to
the
same
natural
rights
that
each
man
alike
and
equally
with
all
others
has
a
birthright
of
which
he
can
not
be
divested
and
of
which
he
can
not
divest
himself
to
act
to
think
and
to
pursue
happiness
wherever
he
can
find
it
without
infringement
on
the
rights
of
his
fellow
beings
none
were
disposed
to
deny
that
each
human
animal
as
each
animal
of
inferior
grade
has
also
the
right
of
subsistence
drained
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
the
great
mother
of
us
all
which
without
his
foreknowledge
or
wish
gave
him
being
seemed
also
indisputable
but
when
from
these
propositions
were
deduced
that
crime
is
rather
the
result
of
misery
than
depravity
and
that
the
office
of
government
is
more
to
prevent
crime
by
creating
happiness
than
to
punish
it
by
creating
misery
and
that
for
the
natural
rights
resigned
by
the
individual
in
entering
into
and
upholding
the
social
system
human
government
is
bound
to
afford
employment
and
subsistence
to
each
of
its
members
that
labor
and
its
produce
should
be
in
partnership
that
competition
should
be
abolished
and
work
and
wages
so
distributed
by
the
state
as
to
equalize
the
condition
of
each
individual
in
the
community
and
finally
that
the
claims
of
labor
are
not
satisfied
by
wages
but
the
workman
is
entitled
to
a
proprietary
share
in
the
capital
which
employs
him
inasmuch
as
all
the
woes
and
miseries
of
the
laborer
arise
exclusively
from
the
competition
for
work
when
these
deductions
were
advanced
the
opulent
and
the
conservative
started
back
in
terror
and
dismay
distribution
of
property
universal
plunder
havoc
bloodshed
sans
culottism
a
red
republic
and
the
ghastly
shapes
of
another
reign
of
terror
rose
in
frightful
vividness
before
the
fancy
as
the
speaker
proceeded
to
illustrate
and
sustain
his
positions
which
were
those
of
the
communist
socialist
fourierist
call
them
which
we
may
and
poured
forth
a
fiery
flood
of
persuasion
invective
denunciation
and
shouts
of
applause
mingled
with
cries
of
rage
and
dismay
rose
from
all
quarters
of
the
hall
unmoved
and
undaunted
that
marble
man
livid
as
a
spectre
his
dark
eyes
blazing
his
thin
and
writhing
lip
flecked
with
foam
his
tall
form
swaying
to
and
fro
rising
bending
now
thrown
back
then
leaning
over
the
marble
bar
of
the
tribune
continued
to
pour
forth
his
scathing
sarcasm
his
crushing
invective
his
eloquent
persuasion
and
his
unanswerable
argument
in
tones
now
soft
and
tuneful
as
a
silvery
bell
then
sad
and
pitiful
as
an
evening
zephyr
then
clear
high
and
sonorous
as
a
clarion
then
hoarse
and
deep
as
the
thunder
for
a
period
of
four
hours
unbroken
and
continuous
without
stop
or
stay
the
effect
of
this
speech
as
the
orator
pale
exhausted
shattered
unstrung
with
nerves
like
the
torn
cordage
of
a
ship
that
has
outridden
the
tempest
descended
from
the
tribune
baffles
all
description
fearful
of
its
influence
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
at
once
arose
and
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
chamber
asked
leave
to
lay
before
it
the
late
dispatches
from
the
seat
of
war
setting
forth
the
glorious
triumphs
of
the
french
arms
in
algeria
this
intelligence
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
been
received
with
rapturous
enthusiasm
was
listened
to
under
the
influence
of
a
counterirritant
already
at
work
with
comparative
calmness
and
its
only
effect
was
to
cause
a
postponement
of
the
vote
on
the
laborers
bill
upon
the
plea
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
although
not
without
strenuous
opposition
from
the
extreme
right
the
rejoicing
of
the
galleries
at
the
triumph
of
their
champion
and
their
fierce
applause
knew
no
bounds
at
the
close
of
the
sitting
and
their
idol
escaped
being
borne
in
his
chair
to
his
lodgings
only
by
gliding
through
a
private
exit
from
the
hall
to
the
first
carriage
he
could
find
what
think
you
cried
beauchamp
triumphantly
to
the
ministerial
secretary
as
they
were
pressed
together
for
an
instant
by
the
excited
throng
on
the
steps
as
they
left
the
hall
think
monsieur
was
the
bitter
rejoinder
of
the
secretary
whose
agitation
completely
overcame
his
habitual
and
constitutional
i
think
paris
is
on
the
eve
of
another
reign
of
terror
beauchamp
laughed
and
the
friends
were
drawn
apart
by
the
conflicting
billows
of
the
crowd
chapter
vi
the
mystery
thickens
dantès
wonderful
speech
was
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
in
every
quarter
of
paris
exciting
comment
of
the
most
animated
description
of
course
the
workmen
and
their
friends
were
delighted
with
it
and
could
not
find
words
strong
enough
to
adequately
express
their
enthusiastic
admiration
for
the
gifted
orator
those
belonging
to
the
government
party
on
the
other
hand
denounced
the
speaker
as
a
demagogue
and
the
speech
as
in
the
highest
degree
incendiary
and
dangerous
strange
to
relate
whoever
spoke
of
the
oration
always
mentioned
the
new
play
the
laborer
of
lyons
attributing
its
authorship
to
the
mysterious
deputy
from
marseilles
and
the
drama
received
cordial
endorsement
or
scathing
censure
according
to
the
political
opinions
of
those
who
alluded
to
it
for
these
reasons
curiosity
in
regard
to
dantès
ran
higher
than
ever
but
instead
of
decreasing
as
he
became
more
prominent
the
mystery
surrounding
him
seemed
only
to
thicken
nevertheless
the
deputy
was
the
lion
of
the
hour
or
rather
would
have
been
had
he
permitted
himself
to
be
lionized
but
this
he
persistently
declined
to
do
holding
aloof
from
society
and
mingling
with
none
save
his
political
associates
though
even
to
them
he
was
a
problem
they
could
not
solve
they
however
recognized
in
him
a
powerful
coadjutor
and
with
that
were
forced
to
be
content
the
hall
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
was
last
evening
thronged
to
overflowing
it
had
been
understood
that
dantès
was
to
advocate
the
people
bill
and
as
usual
it
had
but
to
be
known
that
this
distinguished
orator
was
to
occupy
the
tribune
to
draw
out
all
classes
of
citizens
nor
was
the
vast
multitude
disappointed
a
more
powerful
speech
has
never
been
heard
within
those
walls
more
than
four
hours
was
the
audience
enchained
by
the
matchless
eloquence
of
this
remarkable
man
which
was
received
with
thunders
of
applause
a
report
of
this
speech
will
be
found
under
the
appropriate
head
the
new
play
entitled
laborer
of
lyons
recently
produced
at
the
théâtre
français
with
triumphant
success
and
which
has
caused
such
a
deep
and
universal
sensation
is
repeated
there
is
reason
to
anticipate
that
the
author
who
is
supposed
to
be
a
celebrated
orator
of
the
opposition
may
be
induced
to
comply
with
the
call
which
will
be
again
renewed
to
avow
himself
such
were
two
paragraphs
which
the
following
morning
appeared
in
beauchamp
journal
and
similar
notices
of
both
speech
and
drama
were
published
in
every
other
opposition
sheet
in
paris
in
the
ministerial
organ
on
the
contrary
and
in
all
the
papers
of
like
political
bias
appeared
the
following
and
similar
paragraphs
the
speech
of
dantès
last
evening
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
diatribes
to
which
we
ever
listened
dangerous
for
the
insidious
and
sophistical
principles
it
advanced
and
the
almost
eloquence
with
which
they
were
urged
where
are
these
things
to
stop
at
what
terrible
catastrophe
do
these
men
aim
what
crisis
do
they
contemplate
the
new
drama
at
the
théâtre
français
called
laborer
of
lyons
which
is
to
be
repeated
is
calculated
and
seems
to
have
been
designed
by
its
reckless
author
to
produce
the
very
worst
effects
among
the
laboring
classes
we
deeply
regret
that
it
has
been
suffered
by
the
censors
to
be
brought
out
the
multitude
called
forth
by
paragraphs
like
these
to
witness
the
new
play
was
of
course
immense
long
before
the
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
the
vast
edifice
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
with
an
eager
and
enthusiastic
assemblage
not
only
were
the
galleries
parquette
and
lobbies
filled
with
blouses
but
the
boxes
were
glittering
with
a
perfect
galaxy
of
fashion
loveliness
and
rank
conspicuous
in
the
orchestra
stalls
were
the
three
friends
the
secretary
the
journalist
and
the
deputy
in
a
small
and
private
loge
in
the
second
tier
concealed
from
all
eyes
by
its
light
curtain
of
green
silk
and
its
position
but
himself
viewing
everything
upon
the
stage
or
in
the
house
sat
the
author
of
the
play
calmly
awaiting
the
rising
of
the
curtain
the
performance
at
length
began
and
the
piece
proceeded
to
its
termination
amid
thunders
of
applause
which
as
the
curtain
finally
descended
on
the
last
scene
of
the
last
act
became
perfectly
deafening
accompanied
by
cries
for
the
author
but
no
author
appeared
behind
the
footlights
or
in
the
proscenium
box
and
at
last
the
uproar
becoming
redoubled
the
manager
came
forward
and
in
the
author
behalf
tendered
grateful
acknowledgments
for
the
unprecedented
favor
even
by
a
parisian
audience
with
which
the
production
had
been
received
but
at
the
same
time
entreated
the
additional
favor
that
they
would
grant
the
author
request
and
permit
his
name
for
the
present
to
remain
unknown
he
would
however
venture
to
reveal
this
much
that
the
author
was
a
distinguished
friend
of
the
people
the
earthquake
of
applause
which
succeeded
this
announcement
was
almost
frightful
and
while
the
scene
was
at
its
height
the
three
friends
with
great
difficulty
managed
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
multitude
which
wedged
up
the
lobbies
and
to
make
their
escape
a
friend
of
the
people
cried
debray
bitterly
as
his
coupé
containing
himself
and
companions
drove
off
to
véry
from
such
friends
let
the
people
be
saved
and
they
may
save
themselves
from
their
foes
and
the
play
what
think
you
of
that
cried
beauchamp
that
it
is
a
most
able
and
abominable
production
eminently
calculated
to
cause
exactly
the
evils
which
we
have
this
night
perceived
to
excite
and
rouse
the
worst
passions
of
the
mob
and
render
the
masses
dissatisfied
with
their
inevitable
and
irredeemable
lot
and
as
dangerous
as
wild
beasts
to
all
whose
lot
is
more
favored
man
has
rights
as
man
and
men
in
masses
have
rights
and
one
of
those
rights
is
to
know
actually
what
those
rights
are
said
beauchamp
the
most
melancholy
feature
in
the
oppression
of
man
is
his
ignorance
that
he
is
oppressed
enlighten
him
as
to
those
rights
elevate
his
mind
to
appreciate
and
value
them
and
then
counsel
him
firmly
and
resolutely
to
demand
those
rights
and
quietly
and
wisely
to
obtain
them
aye
but
will
he
obey
such
counsel
exclaimed
will
not
the
result
of
such
enlightenment
and
excitement
prove
as
it
ever
has
proved
anarchy
revolution
guilt
blood
who
shall
restrain
the
monster
once
lashed
into
madness
but
you
can
surely
perceive
no
such
design
in
this
play
and
no
such
effect
rejoined
beauchamp
in
the
abstract
replied
the
count
this
production
is
unexceptionable
most
beautiful
yet
most
powerful
how
it
could
have
been
the
work
of
an
unpracticed
pen
embodying
as
it
does
passages
of
which
the
first
dramatists
of
the
romantic
school
might
be
proud
i
can
not
imagine
besides
there
seems
familiar
acquaintance
with
stage
effect
and
the
way
in
which
it
is
produced
but
that
might
have
been
and
probably
was
the
result
of
some
professional
player
suggestions
and
then
the
profound
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
evinced
its
passions
motives
and
principles
of
action
added
the
journalist
there
seems
an
individuality
a
personality
in
the
production
which
compels
the
idea
that
the
author
is
himself
the
hero
that
he
has
himself
experienced
the
evils
he
so
vividly
portrays
that
the
drama
is
at
once
the
effusion
of
his
own
heart
and
the
embodiment
of
his
own
history
can
that
man
be
m
dantès
if
it
be
he
cried
the
secretary
there
is
more
reason
than
ever
to
call
him
the
most
dangerous
man
in
paris
what
with
his
speeches
in
the
chamber
and
his
plays
at
the
theatre
all
tending
to
one
most
unrighteous
end
and
all
aiming
to
inflame
such
an
explosive
mass
as
the
workmen
of
paris
he
may
be
regarded
as
little
less
than
the
very
agent
of
the
fiend
to
accomplish
havoc
on
earth
yet
strange
to
say
my
dear
secretary
said
the
journalist
laughing
you
have
not
yet
estimated
the
tithe
of
this
man
influence
for
good
or
as
you
think
for
evil
rumor
proclaims
him
to
be
as
immensely
opulent
as
appearances
would
indicate
him
to
be
impoverished
that
his
whole
soul
as
you
say
is
devoted
to
the
people
with
all
his
wonderful
powers
of
mind
and
person
is
undoubted
that
he
has
availed
himself
of
that
grand
lever
the
press
to
accomplish
his
purposes
be
they
good
or
bad
seems
equally
certain
réforme
the
new
daily
is
undoubtedly
under
his
control
if
not
sustained
by
his
pen
and
his
purse
for
it
has
a
wider
circulation
than
all
the
other
parisian
papers
put
together
it
goes
everywhere
it
seeks
the
alleys
not
the
boulevards
finds
its
way
to
the
threshold
of
all
whether
paid
for
or
not
ah
cried
debray
in
great
agitation
is
it
so
and
then
not
only
is
the
public
press
subsidized
by
this
man
if
report
is
not
even
falser
than
usual
but
a
whole
army
of
pamphleteers
journalists
littérateurs
and
students
await
his
bidding
as
well
as
some
of
the
most
distinguished
novelists
and
dramatists
of
the
nation
and
age
my
god
exclaimed
the
count
can
this
be
so
nay
nay
replied
beauchamp
i
make
no
assertions
i
merely
retail
rumors
but
what
can
not
uncounted
wealth
achieve
directed
by
genius
and
intelligence
but
is
this
man
actually
so
wealthy
asked
debray
pale
with
agitation
his
manners
dress
equipage
residence
and
mode
of
life
would
indicate
just
the
reverse
i
know
not
no
one
knows
said
beauchamp
it
is
only
known
to
myself
and
to
a
few
others
that
he
dwells
in
the
mansion
no
rue
du
helder
formerly
the
residence
of
the
count
de
morcerf
and
that
his
private
apartment
is
that
pavilion
at
the
corner
of
the
court
where
at
ten
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
we
breakfasted
with
our
amiable
friend
albert
and
were
met
by
that
remarkable
man
the
count
of
i
remember
that
morning
well
said
everything
it
is
said
remains
in
that
once
splendid
mansion
precisely
as
when
it
was
deserted
by
the
countess
and
her
son
at
the
time
of
the
suicide
of
the
count
everything
except
that
glorious
picture
of
the
catalan
fisherman
by
leopold
robert
in
albert
exquisite
chamber
which
alone
he
took
with
him
it
is
strange
that
a
man
so
opulent
as
you
represent
dantès
to
be
should
adopt
his
magnificence
at
second
hand
observed
debray
coolly
but
i
do
not
represent
him
as
opulent
my
dear
lucien
and
he
certainly
is
the
last
man
either
to
invent
magnificence
or
to
adopt
it
why
he
is
as
plain
in
manners
and
mode
as
simon
himself
his
dress
you
have
seen
as
to
equipage
his
only
conveyance
is
a
public
fiacre
as
to
diet
household
arrangements
and
everything
else
of
a
personal
nature
nothing
can
be
more
republican
and
less
epicurean
than
is
witnessed
at
his
house
his
study
albert
de
morcerf
pavilion
is
said
to
be
the
only
sumptuous
apartment
in
the
whole
establishment
and
that
sumptuousness
is
of
a
character
entirely
literary
and
practical
his
retinue
consists
of
three
servants
called
baptistin
bertuccio
and
ali
the
latter
being
a
nubian
although
fame
gives
him
a
perfect
army
of
servitors
prompt
to
execute
his
bidding
but
i
will
not
indulge
your
skeptical
and
sarcastic
nature
lucien
with
a
detail
of
all
that
rumor
says
of
this
wonderful
man
i
will
only
say
that
all
he
is
and
has
or
hopes
for
seems
devoted
to
one
single
object
the
welfare
of
his
race
has
he
a
wife
asked
debray
he
is
a
widower
with
two
children
a
young
girl
called
zuleika
and
a
youthful
son
called
espérance
but
my
acquaintance
with
him
is
wholly
of
a
public
character
i
have
never
been
in
his
house
and
very
few
there
are
who
have
been
but
here
we
are
and
the
coupé
stopped
at
véry
chapter
vii
dantès
and
his
daughter
even
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
morcerf
mansion
no
rue
du
helder
no
one
was
aware
that
its
new
tenant
was
dantès
the
famous
deputy
from
marseilles
all
the
neighbors
knew
was
that
the
palatial
edifice
had
been
purchased
by
a
stranger
who
said
he
was
acting
for
his
master
a
man
of
great
wealth
lately
arrived
from
the
east
no
repairs
or
alterations
had
been
made
while
the
morcerf
furniture
was
bought
with
the
house
the
only
new
articles
making
their
appearance
being
several
huge
bookcases
and
a
number
of
large
boxes
evidently
containing
books
together
with
a
host
of
traveling
trunks
filled
as
was
to
be
presumed
with
the
wardrobe
of
the
family
the
servants
took
possession
during
the
day
and
were
duly
noted
but
how
or
when
the
proprietor
came
could
not
be
ascertained
while
after
his
installation
glimpses
of
him
were
exceedingly
rare
occasionally
however
a
beautiful
girl
with
an
oriental
look
notwithstanding
her
tasteful
and
elegant
parisian
attire
would
be
seen
for
a
moment
at
the
windows
but
she
invariably
vanished
on
realizing
that
she
was
observed
sometimes
a
handsome
young
man
stood
at
her
side
but
he
also
seemed
anxious
to
avoid
the
scrutiny
of
the
curious
although
he
evinced
less
timidity
than
his
companion
always
withdrawing
slowly
and
with
great
deliberation
it
was
after
midnight
on
the
second
floor
of
the
pavilion
once
inhabited
by
the
viscount
albert
de
morcerf
was
now
a
spacious
library
the
walls
were
lined
with
tall
mounting
to
the
lofty
ceiling
and
groaning
under
ponderous
piles
of
volumes
from
the
huge
black
letter
folio
of
the
middle
ages
to
the
lightest
duodecimo
of
the
day
while
in
all
parts
of
the
chamber
on
the
floor
tables
and
chairs
and
in
the
deep
embrasures
of
the
windows
were
scattered
huge
masses
of
papers
pamphlets
manuscripts
and
charts
over
the
bookcases
stood
marble
busts
of
danton
mirabeau
napoleon
armand
carrel
the
duc
de
simon
and
other
great
men
whose
names
are
identified
with
france
between
the
windows
looking
out
on
the
garden
shrouded
in
shrubs
and
creeping
plants
hung
a
and
magnificent
picture
of
fourier
near
the
centre
of
the
apartment
stood
a
vast
table
covered
with
books
papers
manuscripts
and
writing
materials
beside
which
stood
one
of
those
sombre
and
massive
on
the
possession
of
which
the
former
proprietor
had
so
felicitated
himself
bearing
on
a
carved
shield
the
of
the
louvre
and
in
whose
sumptuous
and
antique
embrace
had
perhaps
reposed
a
richelieu
a
mazarin
or
a
sully
the
windows
were
hung
with
heavy
tapestry
of
ancient
pattern
and
rich
dye
and
also
the
walls
save
where
covered
with
books
a
soft
and
summery
atmosphere
the
warmth
of
which
emanated
from
concealed
furnaces
neutralized
the
chill
of
an
autumnal
night
and
the
mellow
of
a
vast
astral
diffused
its
lunar
effulgence
on
all
around
within
this
chamber
was
a
man
who
with
arms
crossed
upon
his
bosom
and
eyes
fastened
in
profound
and
seemingly
mournful
contemplation
upon
the
floor
slowly
paced
from
one
extremity
of
the
spacious
apartment
to
the
other
this
man
was
dantès
representative
of
marseilles
in
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
at
last
at
last
he
murmured
the
avenging
nemesis
ceases
to
gnaw
at
length
the
angel
peace
begins
to
smile
the
tempest
which
for
nearly
thirty
years
has
raved
and
swelled
in
my
heart
begins
to
lull
at
length
i
commence
to
live
at
length
i
realize
and
pursue
life
true
end
let
me
reflect
he
continued
after
a
pause
let
me
review
the
past
the
past
alas
my
past
is
a
painful
blank
at
twenty
from
the
very
from
the
side
of
her
whom
more
than
life
i
loved
i
was
torn
by
the
envy
of
one
man
and
the
jealousy
of
another
and
then
by
the
ambition
of
a
third
to
whom
nothing
was
crime
if
it
but
ministered
to
that
unhallowed
impulse
i
was
plunged
into
a
dungeon
whose
counterpart
only
the
vaults
of
hell
can
furnish
for
fourteen
long
years
i
was
the
tenant
of
a
sombre
tomb
the
agony
the
despair
of
those
awful
years
oh
god
oh
god
and
he
shuddered
and
clasped
his
hands
over
his
head
as
if
to
crush
the
recollection
after
a
pause
he
resumed
and
then
those
daily
vows
of
vengeance
oh
vain
and
impotent
vows
as
then
they
seemed
vows
of
awful
agony
of
fiendish
retribution
though
at
that
time
i
knew
not
all
i
knew
not
that
a
venerable
father
had
pined
and
died
of
starvation
through
the
wrong
done
to
me
i
knew
not
that
the
woman
i
loved
had
become
the
bride
of
my
destroyer
yet
those
vows
awful
and
blasphemous
as
they
were
those
vows
of
vengeance
have
been
terribly
dreadfully
fulfilled
as
the
destroying
angel
of
god
retributive
providence
i
was
endowed
with
superhuman
powers
to
walk
the
earth
to
administer
his
justice
and
to
execute
his
decrees
for
fourteen
years
was
that
vengeance
prepared
yet
delayed
at
last
it
fell
it
fell
all
who
had
wronged
me
met
their
dreadful
doom
ambition
was
changed
to
madness
avarice
was
tortured
with
bankruptcy
falsehood
sought
refuge
in
self
destruction
and
all
all
all
even
the
meanest
of
those
who
had
contributed
to
blight
my
life
perished
miserably
at
my
will
and
did
the
guilty
suffer
alone
alas
impious
remorseless
horrible
revenge
the
innocent
and
the
criminal
suffered
alike
a
might
approaching
omnipotence
was
vouchsafed
me
but
no
power
of
omniscience
to
direct
my
hand
or
stay
its
effects
blind
and
mad
i
knew
not
what
i
did
those
i
most
loved
fell
beneath
the
blow
which
crushed
those
i
most
abhorred
and
shared
the
same
fate
the
terrible
agencies
i
had
summoned
as
my
slaves
became
my
masters
the
fiends
which
as
ministers
of
god
justice
garbed
in
the
guise
of
angels
of
light
i
had
by
hideous
necromancy
evoked
to
aid
me
in
righteous
retribution
proved
the
dark
demons
of
hell
and
derided
all
orders
to
accomplish
my
bidding
the
awful
engines
i
had
set
in
motion
i
found
myself
powerless
to
arrest
or
control
effects
ceased
not
with
the
causes
in
which
they
had
their
origin
the
stroke
of
vengeance
aimed
at
foes
recoiled
on
friends
recoiled
on
myself
and
when
i
fain
would
stop
when
i
would
arrest
the
awful
havoc
which
my
will
had
commenced
the
dark
ministers
i
had
called
up
howled
in
my
ears
on
on
vengeance
is
thine
vengeance
is
thine
they
mocked
my
terror
and
laughed
at
my
apprehensions
at
last
there
seemed
a
pause
fate
appeared
to
have
done
her
worst
to
have
executed
her
decrees
the
blind
agencies
of
vengeance
blasted
no
more
because
there
seemed
no
more
to
blast
the
misery
i
had
caused
i
strove
to
alleviate
the
innocent
hearts
i
had
crushed
i
endeavored
to
heal
rejoicing
in
the
joy
i
had
created
and
the
affection
i
gratified
once
more
i
loved
loved
but
oh
not
as
i
first
had
loved
not
with
that
deep
adoring
delirious
passion
of
my
youth
and
yet
with
a
subdued
fraternal
feeling
i
loved
in
the
calm
and
sweet
seclusion
of
a
favored
clime
parted
from
the
world
with
all
its
miseries
and
its
crimes
environed
by
all
that
man
or
nature
could
contribute
to
human
bliss
i
began
to
dream
of
happiness
in
the
happiness
i
had
created
but
alas
i
forgot
that
man
happiness
lies
not
in
his
own
hand
but
in
the
hand
of
his
maker
i
forgot
that
an
omniscient
eye
pursued
me
that
a
blasphemed
and
omnipotent
power
was
over
me
the
blow
paused
hovered
fell
not
upon
me
not
on
the
guilty
but
again
it
fell
on
the
innocent
and
she
who
was
my
only
hope
my
beloved
haydée
my
wife
was
snatched
from
my
heart
ruthlessly
murdered
by
that
fiend
benedetto
the
unhappy
man
pressed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
for
some
time
paced
the
chamber
in
silence
then
approaching
a
small
alcove
at
one
extremity
of
the
apartment
he
raised
the
heavy
and
sumptuous
hangings
and
revealed
a
small
silver
casket
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
appointments
that
sparkled
as
the
mellow
light
poured
in
upon
it
dantès
knelt
beside
the
ebony
table
on
which
this
casket
rested
and
for
some
moments
seemed
absorbed
in
prayer
then
rising
and
taking
the
casket
in
his
hands
he
touched
a
spring
when
the
lid
flew
open
disclosing
a
miniature
portrait
of
haydée
set
in
a
frame
of
gold
ornamented
with
flashing
diamonds
and
emeralds
he
gazed
long
and
lovingly
at
this
portrait
that
seemed
designed
to
show
how
exquisitely
fair
god
creatures
may
be
after
which
he
kissed
it
reverently
closed
the
casket
restored
it
to
the
table
and
slowly
dropped
the
hangings
to
their
place
resuming
his
walk
he
said
mournfully
but
the
deepest
wound
will
close
the
heaviest
grief
the
bitterest
woe
becomes
assuaged
time
the
comforter
soothes
and
consoles
from
this
stroke
of
bereavement
i
at
length
awoke
and
at
the
same
moment
awoke
to
the
conviction
that
my
whole
past
had
been
an
error
that
my
life
had
been
a
lie
that
the
years
which
had
succeeded
my
imprisonment
had
been
more
utterly
lost
than
those
passed
within
my
dungeon
itself
and
there
came
to
me
the
conviction
that
time
talent
power
and
wealth
had
been
worse
than
wasted
that
the
wondrous
riches
undreamed
of
save
in
the
wildest
flights
of
oriental
fiction
and
by
a
miracle
bestowed
upon
me
were
designed
for
nobler
holier
purposes
than
to
subserve
a
fiendish
and
blasphemous
vengeance
for
even
unutterable
wrongs
or
to
minister
to
the
gratification
of
pride
and
the
satisfaction
of
selfish
tastes
and
appetites
however
refined
and
sublimated
i
looked
around
me
the
world
was
full
of
misery
and
the
same
disposition
which
had
plunged
me
into
a
dungeon
was
crushing
the
hearts
and
hopes
of
millions
of
my
race
my
bosom
softened
by
bereavement
yearned
toward
my
suffering
fellows
and
the
path
of
duty
peace
and
happiness
seemed
open
to
my
desolate
and
despairing
heart
resolution
followed
conviction
the
world
was
my
field
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
were
my
objects
not
france
alone
with
her
miserable
millions
but
russia
with
her
serfs
poland
with
her
wrongs
the
enslaved
italian
the
oppressed
german
the
starving
son
of
erin
the
squalid
operative
of
england
the
slave
of
jesuit
spain
and
the
oppressed
but
switzer
great
men
and
good
men
i
found
had
already
with
superhuman
skill
constructed
a
system
a
machine
for
the
amelioration
of
mankind
condition
which
needed
only
the
of
boundless
wealth
to
set
it
in
motion
that
wealth
was
mine
the
common
house
for
the
laborer
the
asylum
for
the
insane
for
the
orphan
the
magdalen
the
destitute
the
sick
the
friendless
the
deserted
the
bereaved
or
the
asylum
for
the
victim
of
his
own
vices
or
the
vices
of
others
for
the
depravity
which
originates
in
misery
ignorance
or
fate
all
these
my
riches
could
sustain
around
me
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
design
the
uncounted
wealth
intrusted
to
my
stewardship
has
already
gathered
the
mightiest
minds
in
every
department
of
intellect
and
the
best
hearts
and
if
but
a
few
years
are
vouchsafed
us
to
carry
out
the
system
we
have
adopted
all
europe
despite
her
throned
and
sceptred
tyrants
impiously
claiming
the
right
to
oppress
by
the
will
of
god
shall
be
free
silently
but
surely
the
principle
of
human
liberty
is
ceaselessly
at
work
undermining
thrones
and
overthrowing
dynasties
the
hush
that
precedes
the
tornado
even
now
broods
over
europe
nations
slumber
the
heavy
sleep
that
preludes
the
earthquake
the
hour
of
revolution
is
at
hand
of
social
regeneration
disenthrallment
redemption
over
all
the
world
in
every
capital
of
europe
the
mine
is
prepared
the
train
laid
to
be
lighted
and
from
this
solitary
chamber
the
free
thought
on
the
lightning
pinion
flies
to
vienna
petersburg
rome
madrid
berlin
london
over
mountain
and
plain
over
sea
and
land
through
the
forest
wilderness
and
the
thronged
city
taken
up
by
the
press
it
makes
thrones
totter
and
tyrants
tremble
tremble
at
an
influence
which
emanates
they
know
not
whence
and
contemplates
a
purpose
they
know
not
what
an
influence
whose
mystery
they
are
impotent
to
penetrate
and
whose
shadowy
but
awful
right
they
are
powerless
to
resist
at
that
instant
the
silvery
tinkle
of
a
bell
was
heard
at
the
table
and
a
low
and
continuous
whizzing
as
of
clockwork
at
once
commenced
the
deputy
advanced
hastily
to
the
table
the
register
of
the
electric
telegraph
like
a
living
thing
was
unfolding
the
secrets
of
events
at
that
moment
transpiring
at
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
kingdom
eagerly
seizing
the
slip
of
paper
which
was
gliding
through
the
machine
he
glanced
over
the
cabalistic
cipher
there
traced
lyons
marseilles
rome
algeria
he
murmured
all
goes
well
and
while
the
wonderful
register
like
a
thing
of
life
still
whizzed
clicked
and
delivered
its
magic
scroll
covered
with
characters
unintelligible
to
all
but
him
for
whose
eye
they
were
designed
he
touched
a
spring
and
a
row
of
ivory
keys
resembling
those
of
a

revealed
then
rapidly
touching
them
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
while
he
held
up
before
him
the
endless
slip
of
paper
in
the
other
as
it
was
evolved
he
transferred
its
cabalistic
contents
character
by
character
to
their
distant
destination
and
when
the
day
dawned
on
paris
berlin
vienna
and
madrid
the
intelligence
thus
concentrated
and
thus
distributed
in
that
solitary
chamber
was
laid
by
the
press
before
a
hundred
thousand
eyes
in
a
language
which
each
could
comprehend
for
in
every
capital
of
europe
unbounded
wealth
had
established
a
press
which
groaned
in
unceasing
parturition
for
human
rights
causing
princes
to
tremble
and
ministers
to
wonder
and
grow
pale
over
each
press
thus
set
in
motion
as
if
literally
by
an
electric
touch
a
thousand
miles
away
presided
men
of
the
greatest
powers
and
most
varied
attainments
which
philanthropy
or
covetousness
could
enlist
while
the
result
of
their
labors
was
sown
broadcast
among
the
poorest
and
humblest
without
price
or
compensation
pouring
light
upon
their
darkened
understandings
and
giving
them
knowledge
of
their
rights
nor
was
the
newspaper
press
alone
active
the
feuilleton
press
was
also
at
work
and
magazines
reviews
pamphlets
whole
libraries
of
volumes
were
flung
like
sibylline
leaves
on
the
four
winds
of
heaven
fiction
the
drama
religion
art
literature
moral
and
mechanical
science
all
departments
of

silently
unseen
yet
surely
exerted
their
omnipotent
influence
for
the
attainment
of
one
single
glorious
end
the
happiness
rights
freedom
of
man
all
this
was
under
the
guidance
of
one
powerful
mind
and
benevolent
heart
wielding
the
resistless
necromancy
of
countless
and
exhaustless
treasure
not
a
point
in
all
europe
whence
influence
could
radiate
and
be
distributed
was
there
at
which
this
man
in
one
brief
year
had
not
set
in
motion
the
press
and
the
telegraph
those
tremendous
levers
of
the
age
to
move
the
world
and
all
the
more
powerfully
to
move
it
because
oft
unseen
not
a
court
was
there
of
emperor
or
prince
czar
or
kaiser
king
duke
or
potentate
in
which
dwelt
not
his
emissary
who
suspected
least
of
all
knew
everything
that
occurred
and
on
the
lightning
wing
dispatched
it
to
its
destination
so
that
the
most
important
decrees
of
the
of
vienna
were
exposed
to
the
whole
world
by
the
parisian
press
long
before
they
had
been
communicated
by
metternich
to
his
sovereign
and
thus
often
the
ruler
first
learned
the
purposes
of
the
minister
not
a
city
or
village
was
there
in
all
europe
which
nourished
not
in
its
bosom
the
germ
of
reform
and
revolution
while
the
great
principle
of
association
combined
embodied
and
concentrated
into
a
focus
energies
and
influences
which
would
otherwise
have
proved
comparatively
powerless
the
click
and
buzz
of
the
register
ceased
the
engine
had
revealed
its
secret
the
shadowy
tale
had
been
caught
up
as
it
fell
and
given
to
the
press
of
all
europe
thence
to
be
laid
before
men
minds
exhausted
by
the
severe
mental
toil
and
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
deputy
sank
back
into
his
and
clasped
his
hands
glorious
omnipotent
science
he
exclaimed
in
low
and
trembling
yet
eager
and
enthusiastic
tones
wealth
must
yield
in
power
to
thee
for
what
wealth
can
rival
thy
achievements
or
secure
thy
results
thou
hast
girt
the
earth
with
forced
the
lightning
to
syllable
the
unspoken
thought
and
made
man
mind
ubiquitous
like
god
ere
long
thou
wilt
have
knit
together
with
thy
magic
spells
a
world
of
mankind
into
one
vast
brotherhood
dantès
ceased
and
closing
his
eyes
wearily
continued
to
think
over
the
possibilities
of
the
future
as
he
sat
there
motionless
and
seemingly
asleep
a
light
footfall
was
heard
in
the
apartment
and
his
daughter
stood
before
him
zuleika
was
now
sixteen
tall
and
matured
beyond
her
years
she
greatly
resembled
her
dead
mother
haydée
the
beautiful
greek
and
the
costume
she
wore
helped
to
render
the
resemblance
still
more
striking
her
abundant
hair
was
the
hue
of
the
raven
wing
her
feet
and
hands
were
those
of
a
fairy
while
her
large
and
expressive
eyes
flashed
like
diamonds
and
her
parted
lips
as
red
as
rubies
disclosed
perfect
teeth
of
the
whiteness
of
pearls
a
shade
of
anxiety
settled
upon
her
handsome
countenance
as
she
bent
over
her
weary
father
the
deputy
opened
his
eyes
and
glanced
at
her
why
are
you
up
so
late
my
child
he
asked
fondly
i
thought
you
were
sleeping
soundly
long
ere
this
i
was
waiting
for
you
papa
replied
zuleika
in
a
low
musical
voice
that
sounded
like
a
chime
of
tiny
bells
i
could
not
retire
to
my
couch
while
you
were
toiling
dantès
pointed
to
a
stool
the
young
girl
brought
it
and
seated
herself
at
his
feet
he
drew
her
to
his
knee
smoothing
her
tresses
gently
and
affectionately
so
you
would
not
desert
me
darling
he
said
with
a
glad
smile
no
indeed
dear
papa
answered
she
nestling
closer
to
him
will
you
always
love
me
as
you
do
now
zuleika
asked
the
father
looking
down
into
the
liquid
depths
of
her
eyes
oh
papa
what
a
question
what
a
singular
question
said
the
girl
springing
to
her
feet
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissing
him
again
and
again
but
love
of
another
kind
and
for
another
will
come
along
after
awhile
said
the
deputy
sadly
and
then
you
will
forget
your
father
zuleika
blushed
and
hung
her
head
in
maidenly
modesty
then
she
exclaimed
no
no
papa
never
will
i
forget
you
whatever
may
happen
ah
my
darling
you
know
not
what
you
are
saying
it
is
only
natural
for
a
woman
to
cast
her
father
aside
and
cleave
unto
her
husband
but
papa
i
have
not
even
a
lover
yet
and
besides
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
merely
a
little
girl
and
your
own
true
loving
daughter
yes
yes
but
you
must
remember
that
last
year
young
as
you
were
then
you
attracted
marked
attention
from
several
youthful
romans
of
the
best
families
in
the
eternal
city
and
that
one
of
them
the
viscount
giovanni
massetti
went
so
far
as
to
ask
me
for
your
hand
at
the
mention
of
massetti
name
the
blush
upon
zuleika
cheek
deepened
she
trembled
slightly
but
said
nothing
her
heart
fluttered
painfully
but
the
pain
was
not
altogether
disagreeable
the
young
viscount
was
evidently
not
unpleasing
to
her
dantès
resumed
looking
at
her
fixedly
the
while
my
daughter
as
you
were
then
attending
the
convent
school
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
deny
giovanni
massetti
solicitation
nay
his
ardent
impetuous
prayer
but
i
did
not
deprive
him
of
all
hope
i
gave
him
permission
to
urge
his
suit
with
you
personally
after
a
year
from
that
time
had
elapsed
did
i
do
right
zuleika
maintained
silence
but
blushed
and
trembled
more
than
ever
while
her
heart
fluttered
so
that
she
placed
her
hand
upon
her
breast
to
still
it
come
come
my
daughter
answer
me
said
the
deputy
kindly
did
i
do
right
tell
me
what
your
little
heart
says
i
do
not
know
oh
i
do
not
know
cried
zuleika
bursting
into
tears
there
there
now
said
her
father
soothingly
i
did
not
mean
either
to
frighten
or
wound
you
if
the
viscount
is
displeasing
to
you
i
will
answer
his
letter
and
tell
him
as
gently
as
possible
that
he
has
no
hope
of
winning
your
hand
what
have
you
received
a
letter
from
giovanni
exclaimed
zuleika
with
sudden
interest
her
tears
vanishing
instantly
and
her
pretty
face
brightening
up
ho
ho
said
dantès
to
himself
mademoiselle
has
waked
up
in
earnest
now
then
he
added
aloud
yes
one
came
this
afternoon
the
viscount
is
in
paris
and
has
claimed
the
privilege
i
accorded
him
a
year
ago
provided
you
interposed
no
objection
however
the
matter
can
speedily
be
settled
young
massetti
is
a
man
of
honor
and
will
not
for
an
instant
think
of
troubling
with
his
attentions
a
lady
to
whom
they
can
not
prove
acceptable
oh
papa
papa
do
tell
him
that
he
would
come
here
if
you
did
besides
did
did
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
giovanni
attentions
would
prove
unacceptable
to
me
no
not
in
so
many
words
answered
dantès
archly
but
i
inferred
as
much
from
your
manner
and
tears
just
now
so
i
am
to
understand
that
you
do
not
want
me
to
reply
to
the
viscount
letter
am
i
oh
yes
i
want
you
to
reply
to
his
letter
but
but
but
what
darling
i
do
not
wish
you
to
tell
him
there
is
no
hope
you
think
there
is
hope
then
i
i
am
afraid
so
dear
papa
yet
a
moment
ago
you
told
me
you
had
no
lover
and
were
merely
a
little
girl
i
did
not
know
then
that
giovanni
was
in
paris
and
i
i
thought
he
had
forgotten
all
about
me
dantès
smiled
as
he
said
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
does
it
mademoiselle
yes
answered
zuleika
innocently
then
she
added
in
a
tone
of
great
earnestness
write
to
giovanni
in
the
morning
and
and
tell
him
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
i
will
write
and
inform
him
that
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
my
daughter
does
not
object
to
receiving
a
visit
from
him
oh
that
would
be
too
cold
and
formal
and
giovanni
is
such
an
old
friend
well
well
said
dantès
i
will
so
frame
my
reply
as
to
give
entire
satisfaction
both
to
you
and
him
now
my
child
kiss
me
and
retire
to
your
couch
for
it
is
very
very
late
zuleika
embraced
her
father
and
kissed
him
repeatedly
then
with
beaming
eyes
and
a
countenance
overflowing
with
happiness
she
ran
lightly
from
the
apartment
as
she
tripped
joyously
away
dantès
arose
from
his
and
gazed
after
her
with
a
look
of
the
utmost
sadness
oh
my
daughter
my
daughter
he
murmured
soon
will
you
also
quit
me
and
then
i
shall
be
alone
indeed
true
espérance
will
remain
but
generous
manly
and
heroic
as
he
is
he
can
never
fill
the
void
zuleika
will
leave
oh
haydée
haydée
my
beloved
wife
why
were
you
torn
so
ruthlessly
from
your
husband
heart
zuleika
dreams
that
night
were
and
delicious
and
in
all
of
them
the
central
figure
was
the
youthful
roman
viscount
when
day
dawned
dantès
was
still
pacing
his
library
chapter
viii
a
vast
printing
house
a
street
somewhat
famous
in
paris
is
the
rue
lepelletier
famous
not
for
its
length
for
its
breadth
for
the
splendid
edifices
it
exhibits
or
for
the
scenes
and
events
it
has
witnessed
but
famous
for
the
exploits
beheld
by
its
neighbors
and
the
magnificent
structures
by
them
displayed
not
that
the
rue
lepelletier
can
boast
no
fine
edifices
for
the
grand
would
give
the
loud
lie
to
such
an
assertion
and
then
there
is
the
foreign
office
near
by
the
hôtel
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
des
capucines
and
other
noted
places
but
there
is
one
structure
on
the
rue
lepelletier
not
very
noticeable
save
for
its
immense
size
and
its
ancient
and
dingy
aspect
which
has
witnessed
more
scenes
and
events
and
is
more
important
than
all
its
more
splendid
neighbors
put
together
this
edifice
is
of
brick
five
stories
in
height
and
as
has
been
intimated
is
and
stained
it
would
seem
by
all
other
conceivable
causes
of
stain
so
begrimed
and
dingy
yet
so
venerable
and
imposing
does
it
seem
this
vast
and
ancient
pile
can
be
said
to
represent
no
order
of
architecture
architectural
elegance
appears
not
to
have
been
thought
of
when
it
was
designed
and
yet
the
façade
of
the
old
building
seems
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
building
itself
as
the
face
of
an
old
man
bears
to
his
body
and
that
face
is
full
of
character
as
are
the
faces
of
some
men
sombre
sedate
serious
almost
sinister
in
aspect
this
old
face
too
seemed
full
of
apertures
through
which
unceasing
and
sleepless
espionage
could
be
kept
up
on
the
good
citizens
of
the
good
city
of
paris
doors
and
especially
windows
numberless
opened
and
looked
upon
the
street
and
on
a
cul
de
sac
at
one
end
of
the
edifice
one
of
the
doors
opening
on
the
cul
de
sac
at
its
further
extremity
was
broad
low
dark
and
sombre
like
the
gates
of
hell
as
portrayed
by
the
english
bard
it
stood
open
night
and
day
if
you
entered
this
door
and
advanced
you
would
immediately
find
yourself
ascending
a
narrow
gloomy
and
winding
flight
of
stairs
having
with
difficulty
groped
your
way
to
the
top
without
having
broken
your
neck
by
having
first
reached
the
point
from
which
you
started
to
wit
the
bottom
or
your
shins
by
stumbling
against
the
steps
having
i
say
accomplished
the
ascent
to
the
first
landing
your
further
passage
is
effectually
stopped
by
a
massive
door
which
resists
all
your
efforts
to
open
it
and
as
you
are
contemplating
the
dangerous
descent
which
you
now
think
you
are
immediately
and
inevitably
forced
to
make
an
ivory
against
the
wall
beside
the
door
arrests
your
attention
with
the
words
around
it
which
with
difficulty
you
decipher
by
the
dim
light
editor
room
no
admittance
followed
by
the
encouraging
but
somewhat
contradictory
word
ring
which
doubtless
means
this
if
you
are
a
particular
friend
of
the
editor
or
have
particular
business
with
him
as
a
journalist
ring
the
bell
and
perhaps
you
may
be
admitted
supposing
either
of
these
positions
yours
you
ring
the
bell
and
immediately
you
are
startled
by
the
tinkling
of
a
small
bell
in
the
darkness
close
beside
you
and
the
ponderous
door
firm
as
a
barricade
till
then
is
now
opened
by
unseen
hands
by
the
same
hand
indeed
and
by
the
same
action
of
that
hand
which
caused
the
bell
to
tinkle
you
enter
the
door
and
find
yourself
in
a
corridor
or
passage
long
and
dark
for
everything
in
this
building
is
dark
and
gaslight
is
the
only
light
eighteen
hours
in
the
you
find
yourself
in
a
corridor
i
say
running
the
entire
depth
of
the
building
and
bringing
you
back
again
toward
the
rue
lepelletier
which
you
left
on
entering
the
cul
de
sac
to
seek
the
low
entrance
below
as
you
traverse
the
endless
gallery
your
attention
is
arrested
by
a
deep
hum
as
of
many
voices
at
a
distance
with
which
the
entire
structure
seems
pervaded
accompanied
by
a
heavier
sound
which
rises
and
falls
with
measured
stroke
this
mysterious
hum
might
have
been
heard
when
you
first
approached
or
entered
the
building
but
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
corridor
have
caused
you
to
notice
it
now
for
the
first
time
and
to
wonder
at
its
cause
now
had
you
the
power
of
those
magicians
necromancers
clairvoyants
and
whether
of
the
flesh
or
the
spirit
who
at
a
glance
can
gaze
through
massive
walls
and
peer
down
the
chimneys
of
a
great
city
and
who
almost
without
glancing
at
all
can
see
through
partitions
and
iron
doors
your
wonder
at
the
cause
of
these
unknown
sounds
would
instantly
cease
while
it
would
be
yet
more
excited
by
those
causes
themselves
for
the
vast
building
all
around
you
and
through
which
you
are
passing
and
which
envelops
you
in
its
ceaseless
hum
like
the
voice
of
a
great
city
would
seem
to
you
nothing
less
than
a
leviathan
of
life
and
action
a
titan
a
frankenstein
a
mental
and
material
giant
with
its
acoustic
tubes
like
veins
and
arteries
running
all
over
the
structure
just
beneath
the
surface
of
the
walls
and
uniting
in
every
apartment
with
its
electric
wires
like
bundles
of
nerves
which
having
webbed
the
whole
body
with
network
converge
into
a
and
thence
pass
down
into
the
vaults
through
the
massive
foundations
and
beneath
the
pavements
of
the
thronged
streets
of
the
metropolis
and
thence
rising
again
to
the
surface
branching
on
distinct
diverse
and
solitary
routes
without
the
suburbs
all
over
europe
you
would
see
too
the
mighty
heart
of
this
titan
whose
heavy
heavings
you
have
felt
heard
and
wondered
at
the
press
in
its
subterranean
tenement
amid
smoke
and
flame
the
press
which
like
the
animal
heart
receives
eventually
all
that
the
veins
convey
to
it
and
flings
forth
everything
in
modified
form
through
lungs
and
arteries
tireless
and
untired
in
its
action
never
ceasing
never
resting
for
as
well
might
a
man
think
to
live
when
his
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
as
a
printing
office
exist
when
the
throbbings
of
its
press
were
no
longer
felt
and
as
well
could
a
man
be
supposed
to
live
without
breath
as
a
of
the
nineteenth
century
without
its
lungs
the
steam
engine
or
its
breath
of
life
the
subtle
fluid
by
which
it
is
moved
but
to
drop
metaphor
in
the
basement
of
the
building
you
would
find
the
with
its
steam
engine
its
furnaces
its
presses
its
dark
and
ghostly
and
ghastly
gnomes
and
genii
groping
or
flitting
about
amid
the
glare
and
gloom
begrimed
and
besmoked
seemingly
at
work
at
unhallowed
yet
supernatural
toil
which
toil
as
if
a
punishment
for
sin
like
that
of
sisyphus
or
the
daughters
of
danae
in
the
heathen
tartarus
was
eternal
the
press
never
stops
on
the
first
floor
you
would
perceive

that
you
will
shortly
behold

find

whence
fly
the
winged
words
all
over
the

peopled
by
its
whole
army
of
compositors
while
from
the
long
platoons
of

click

is
heard
the
sole
and
unceasing
sound
which
alone
in

is
ever
suffered
to
fall
on
the

we
add
that

our
description
will
be
complete
and
we
may
say
such
is
the
printing
office
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
paris
how
changed
from
that
of

or
english
caxton
three
hundred
years
before
such
is
it
by
daylight
flood
every
object

you
have
the
scene
at
night
through
all
the
night
for
couriers

never
cease
to
arrive
and
the
journal
issues
with
the
dawn
and
the
workmen
are
relieved
by
constant
and
continuous
relays
such
an
office
gives
employment
to
hundreds
and
bread
to
thousands
it
demands
twenty

chiefly
valuable
for
reference

bearing
ample

scrupulously
eschewed
practical
utility
is
the
only
question
of
interest
as
touching
the
instruments
of
an

as
of
those
of

bears
no

respects

not
for
its
beauty
of

costliness
of
material
or
construction
in
one
respect
only
was
there
variance
from
this
settled
custom
to
be
perceived

that
was
in
that
delicate
mechanism
embodying
the
triumphs
of
modern
science
which
facilitates
transmission
of
thought
and
which
by
skillful
adaptation
made
this
one
chamber
a
focus
to
which
ideas
and
feeling
in
every
other
apartment
of
that
vast
establishment
converged

which
enabled

his

everything
being

the

of

single
mind
indeed
to
such
an
extent
is
carried
in
the
parisian
printing
office
that

chapter
ix
armand
marrast
the
journalist
who
now
occupied
the
editorial
chair
was
seemingly
about
years
of
age
and
one
whom
the
ladies
would
call
a
man
his
stature
was
about
the
average
his
shoulders
broad
and
his
form
his
face
was
long
and
thin
his
forehead
full
and
capacious
though
not
high
and
was
furrowed
by
thought
his
beard
which
like
his
hair
was
black
encircled
his
chin
and
a
moustache
was
suffered
to
adorn
his
lip
his
dress
was
black
and
a
plain
stock
without
a
collar
surrounded
his
throat
his
eyes
were
large
black
and
piercing
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
contemplative
and
sad
such
is
a
hasty
limning
of
the
personal
outlines
of
the
first
journalist
in
paris
the
chief
editor
of
the
chief
organ
of
the
democracy
in
europe
armand
marrast
of
le
national
an
air
of
depression
exhaustion
and
regret
was
upon
his
face
as
he
sat
beside
the
table
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
and
paper
before
him
in
a
thoughtful
mood
as
if
planning
a
leader
for
his
journal
of
which
but
a
single
line
was
written
whatever
were
his
reflections
they
were
evidently
far
from
pleasant
but
the
single
line
traced
at
the
head
of
the
paper
indicated
the
source
of
his
uneasiness
it
read
again
the
house
of
orléans
triumphs
throwing
down
his
pen
he
folded
his
arms
and
began
hastily
pacing
the
chamber
again
the
house
of
orléans
triumphs
he
bitterly
exclaimed
aye
again
and
again
it
is
thus
forever
and
thus
forever
seems
likely
to
continue
every
measure
however
imperative
of
the
opposition
ignominiously
fails
every
measure
of
the
government
however
infamous
succeeds
and
so
it
has
been
for
twelve
years
ah
what
a
barren
sceptre
did
the
three
days
of
place
in
the
hands
of
the
french
people
the
despotism
of
a
citizen
king
has
been
as
deadly
as
that
of
the
restoration
and
more
insulting
for
twelve
years
his
acts
have
been
but
a
continuous
series
of
infringements
upon
the
rights
and
insults
to
the
opinions
of
the
men
of
july
the
republican
party
is
trampled
on
freedom
of
the
press
electoral
reform
rights
of
labor
restriction
of
the
royal
prerogative
reduction
of
the
civil
list
all
these
measures
are
effectually
crushed
the
press
is
fettered
and
its
conductors
are
incarcerated
out
of
a
population
of
millions
but
two
hundred
thousand
are
electors
out
of
four
hundred
and
sixty
deputies
hold
places
under
the
government
the
aggregate
of
whose
salaries
would
sustain
thousands
of
starving
families
at
their
very
doors
paris
despite
every
struggle
of
freedom
is
at
this
hour
a
bastille
the
line
of
fortification
is
complete
wherever
the
eye
turns
battlements
frown
ordnance
protrudes
bayonets
bristle
corruption
stalks
unblushingly
abroad
in
the
highest
places
and
the
frauds
of
gisquet
all
paris
knows
are
but
those
of
an
individual
the
civil
list
instead
of
being
reduced
is
every
year
enlarged
a
citizen
king
receives
forty
times
the
appropriation
received
by
the
first
consul
while
his
whole
family
are
quartered
on
the
state
the
dotation
to
the
duke
of
orléans
on
his
marriage
would
have
saved
from
starvation
hundreds
of
thousands
whose
claim
for
charity
far
exceeded
his
thank
god
his
own
personal
unpopularity
defeated
the
dotation
designed
for
the
duke
of
nemours
but
the
appanages
were
granted
because
the
life
was
attempted
by
an
assassin
a
citizen
king
indeed
this
man
cares
only
for
his
own
he
would
be
allied
to
every
dynasty
in
europe
his
policy
is
unmixed
selfishness
his
love
for
the
people
who
made
him
their
monarch
is
swallowed
up
in
love
for
himself
millions
have
been
wrung
from
the
sweat
of
toil
to
accomplish
a
worse
than
useless
conquest
thousands
of
frenchmen
have
been
sacrificed
on
the
burning
sands
of
africa
and
all
for
what
that
a
throne
might
be
won
for
a
boy
a
boy
without
ability
or
experience
and
now
the
duke
of
aumale
is
of
algeria
while
hundreds
of
brave
men
are
forgotten
as
these
last
words
which
indicated
the
cause
of
the
present
agitation
were
uttered
by
the
excited
journalist
a
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
softly
opened
and
a
young
man
of
very
low
stature
and
boyish
in
aspect
entered
he
seemed
at
a
first
glance
hardly
to
have
attained
his
majority
though
actually
he
was
ten
years
older
his
face
was
round
yet
pale
his
lips
full
his
brow
commanding
his
eye
large
dark
and
thoughtful
and
his
characteristic
expression
mild
and
benevolent
he
wore
a
dark
frock
coat
buttoned
to
the
chin
and
a
plain
black
cravat
was
tied
around
his
neck
the
journalist
was
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
meditations
that
for
some
moments
he
seemed
unaware
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
and
he
might
have
remained
yet
longer
in
that
ignorance
had
not
the
guest
approached
and
exclaimed
algeria
the
journalist
raised
his
head
and
hastily
turned
ah
louis
is
it
you
he
said
cordially
extending
his
hand
i
glad
you
come
but
why
did
i
not
hear
you
for
two
reasons
my
dear
armand
said
the
visitor
seating
himself
in
an
editorial
chair
one
that
i
came
in
by
the
private
entrance
and
the
other
that
you
were
too
zealously
engaged
in
cursing
the
recent
appointment
of
the
king
to
hear
anything
short
of
a
salvo
of
artillery
ah
that
cursed
appointment
what
next
i
wonder
thank
god
the
old
man
has
no
more
sons
to
make
governors
although
he
never
be
satisfied
till
each
one
of
them
has
a
crown
on
his
head
by
his
own
right
or
the
right
of
a
wife
and
what
care
we
whom
the
boys
marry
so
long
as
marriage
takes
them
out
of
france
montpensier
can
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
spanish
infanta
christina
sister
and
thus
balk
england
be
it
so
yes
be
it
so
especially
since
it
ca
be
helped
or
prevented
but
this
affair
of
algeria
louis
is
a
very
different
affair
you
would
say
no
doubt
no
doubt
as
to
algeria
i
have
always
viewed
it
as
a
very
costly
bauble
for
france
as
the
duke
of
broglie
once
said
too
expensive
for
france
but
then
it
has
been
a
splendid
arena
for
french
valor
it
has
given
the
rough
old
bugeaud
a
marshal
bâton
and
has
made
the
gallant
lamoricière
his
sworn
foe
a
general
officer
thanks
to
his
own
intrepid
conduct
and
the
court
influence
of
his
thiers
in
the
late
dispatch
appear
the
names
of
some
new
candidates
for
advancement
i
perceive
you
allude
to
morrel
and
joliette
among
others
i
suppose
morrel
has
received
a
regiment
and
joliette
is
chef
of
spahis
luckily
for
aspirants
and
thanks
to
disease
and
slaughter
there
is
no
lack
of
vacancies
the
name
of
morrel
i
have
seen
before
in
the
but
joliette
who
is
he
a
sort
of
protégé
of
bugeaud
is
said
he
is
reported
to
have
enlisted
at
marseilles
and
in
three
years
has
risen
to
his
present
position
from
the
ranks
he
is
of
a
good
family
rumor
says
but
suddenly
reduced
by
some
calamity
he
became
a
soldier
he
must
be
a
brave
fellow
armand
as
i
said
before
algeria
has
been
a
fine
field
for
the
development
of
military
genius
my
chief
objections
to
french
conquests
are
these
they
have
drained
millions
from
france
which
should
have
been
devoted
to
the
cause
of
labor
and
have
tended
to
dazzle
the
masses
with
the
glory
of
the
achievements
of
french
valor
abroad
thus
while
thousands
of
the
young
and
enterprising
have
been
lured
away
to
fill
up
the
ranks
and
to
seek
fame
and
fortune
the
minds
of
those
remaining
have
been
withdrawn
from
their
own
wrongs
oppression
and
suffering
and
from
efficiently
concerting
to
sustain
the
measures
of
their
friends
for
their
relief
there
is
not
a
race
in
christendom
so
fond
of
military
glory
and
achievement
as
the
french
dazzled
by
this
the
people
the
masses
the
people
the
masses
impatiently
interrupted
the
journalist
you
know
me
louis
for
years
you
have
known
me
well
for
years
have
we
devoted
every
energy
of
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
of
the
people
and
for
years
ever
since
we
came
to
man
estate
have
we
been
equal
sufferers
in
the
same
cause
sufferers
in
the
cause
of
the
people
of
france
in
the
cause
of
man
we
both
doubtless
have
been
but
not
equal
sufferers
what
have
been
my
sacrifices
or
sufferings
my
dear
armand
compared
to
yours
in
that
dark
hour
when
armand
carrel
fell
fell
by
an
ignoble
bullet
in
an
ignoble
cause
fell
in
bitterness
and
without
a
hope
for
liberty
in
his
beloved
france
i
felt
impelled
to
come
forward
and
exert
myself
for
the
welfare
of
my
race
and
endeavor
to
aid
others
in
filling
the
gap
created
by
his
loss
to
france
to
my
country
did
i
then
though
but
a
boy
devote
myself
france
my
country
for
such
i
feel
her
to
be
though
i
was
born
in
spain
and
my
mother
was
a
corsican
since
that
hour
my
pen
has
been
dedicated
to
the
cause
of
the
people
the
dethronement
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
organization
of
labor
as
to
sacrifice
or
suffering
i
have
sacrificed
only
my
time
and
toil
at
the
worst
i
have
not
been
deemed
worthy
of
suffering
even
a
fine
for
a
newspaper
libel
and
my
paper
has
never
been
thought
worth
suppression
and
what
have
i
accomplished
louis
asked
marrast
gloomily
my
life
seems
almost
a
blank
with
armand
carrel
you
have
for
fifteen
years
been
the
champion
of
republicanism
in
france
and
with
you
as
leaders
has
all
been
accomplished
that
now
exists
when
carrel
died
on
you
fell
his
mantle
as
editor
of
tribune
your
boldness
and
charging
casimir
perier
and
marshal
soult
with
connivance
in
gisquet
scandalous
frauds
brought
upon
you
fine
and
imprisonment
your
boldness
and
patriotism
during
the
insurrection
of
the
and
of
june
once
more
caused
your
paper
to
be
stopped
and
your
presses
to
be
sealed
in
april
your
press
was
again
stopped
and
you
with
godefroi
cavaignac
were
thrown
into
sainté
pélagie
whence
you
so
gallantly
escaped
though
to
become
an
exile
in
england
again
in
you
were
sentenced
to
transportation
so
much
for
sufferings
as
to
sacrifices
why
you
have
been
utterly
ruined
by
fines
well
louis
well
was
the
sad
answer
granting
all
this
my
sacrifices
and
sufferings
are
only
the
more
bitter
from
the
fact
of
having
been
utterly
in
vain
entirely
useless
you
louis
have
been
wiser
than
i
your
journal
is
well
named
sens
possibly
wiser
was
the
reply
and
possibly
less
bold
but
does
not
discretion
sometimes
win
what
boldness
would
sacrifice
in
rashly
struggling
for
all
we
sometimes
lose
all
prudence
and
perseverance
my
dear
armand
are
invaluable
chapter
x
the
communists
at
this
moment
the
private
door
opened
and
three
men
entered
the
editorial
sanctum
marrast
quickly
turned
and
his
friend
was
silent
ha
albert
flocon
rollin
he
cried
welcome
welcome
our
friend
louis
blanc
was
just
about
wasting
on
me
a
sermon
upon
patience
but
now
he
have
an
audience
worthy
of
the
subject
be
seated
and
listen
patience
exclaimed
flocon
well
i
sure
we
need
it
that
we
do
in
our
present
low
estate
echoed
rollin
albert
said
nothing
but
smiled
with
sarcastic
significance
when
the
salutations
were
over
and
the
party
all
but
marrast
who
restlessly
paced
the
room
were
seated
louis
blanc
looked
around
on
his
friends
with
a
sad
smile
and
continued
marrast
is
right
messieurs
i
was
indeed
preaching
patience
i
was
endeavoring
to
soothe
his
irritation
and
chide
his
depression
with
a
sermon
since
we
are
all
old
friends
and
in
the
good
cause
and
have
a
common
interest
in
knowing
the
reasons
of
failure
and
the
means
of
triumph
i
will
by
your
leave
proceed
aye
dear
louis
go
on
cried
marrast
kindly
but
you
are
the
most
youthful
sage
i
ever
listened
to
yes
louis
proceed
you
look
like
a
curé
said
rollin
laughing
i
subscribe
to
louis
blanc
creed
be
it
what
it
may
added
flocon
briskly
and
so
do
i
said
albert
gravely
in
a
deep
tone
of
the
new
visitors
ledru
rollin
was
a
man
of
medium
stature
about
years
of
age
and
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
the
mode
his
complexion
and
hair
were
light
his
eyes
large
blue
and
protruding
his
mouth
prominent
and
his
full
cheeks
covered
with
whiskers
which
like
those
of
marrast
were
closely
trimmed
and
met
beneath
his
chin
his
head
and
shoulders
were
thrown
back
and
his
air
was
bold
and
independent
he
was
a
lawyer
of
talent
who
had
gained
celebrity
as
advocate
of
the
accused
on
many
occasions
of
state
prosecutions
flocon
was
an
older
man
than
rollin
and
his
countenance
bore
the
wary
vigilant
and
suspicious
look
which
experience
alone
gives
he
was
low
in
stature
and
in
figure
his
eyes
seemed
always
half
closed
his
brow
was
broad
and
massive
his
face
was
long
a
moustache
was
on
his
lip
and
his
hair
was
closely
cut
the
outline
of
his
head
and
the
expression
of
his
face
seemed
those
rather
of
one
born
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
than
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
so
calm
and
passionless
did
they
appear
his
dress
was
plain
but
neat
flocon
was
the
chief
editor
of
la
réforme
the
name
of
which
indicates
its
character
it
was
this
man
who
in
february
repressed
the
violence
of
his
partisans
and
saved
the
office
of
the
gazette
de
france
yet
the
very
next
day
published
his
celebrated
letter
to
the
legitimists
which
for
audacity
force
and
pungency
was
only
equaled
by
the
paralyzing
effect
it
produced
the
fines
imprisonments
and
civil
incapacities
to
which
this
man
had
been
subjected
for
assaults
upon
a
government
he
deemed
corrupt
for
the
ten
years
preceding
had
been
literally
numberless
albert
was
a
man
of
fifty
or
more
with
a
large
head
square
german
face
and
forehead
a
large
hazel
eye
fixed
and
unexcitable
hair
closely
cut
and
beard
upon
his
chin
and
lip
his
dress
was
a
long
frock
coat
buttoned
closely
to
his
chin
his
face
was
rather
thin
and
his
complexion
bronzed
his
name
had
for
years
been
identified
with
reform
and
though
a
manufacturer
himself
of
the
class
of
workmen
being
proprietor
and
chief
engineer
of
a
large
machine
factory
at
lyons
he
had
established
and
sustained
in
that
city
a
paper
to
advocate
his
principles
named
la
glaneuse
the
prosecution
of
which
by
the
government
for
libel
and
the
fining
and
imprisonment
of
its
editor
formed
an
originating
cause
of
the
revolt
in
lyons
of
april
for
the
part
played
by
this
man
in
the
revolt
thus
arising
he
was
sentenced
to
transportation
a
penalty
afterwards
commuted
to
fine
and
imprisonment
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
remarkably
few
but
of
deep
thought
and
prompt
action
and
in
moments
of
crisis
and
emergency
a
man
of
unshaken
and
inflexible
nerve
to
the
casual
observer
he
seemed
only
a
silent
man
or
a
sullen
one
astute
or
stolid
in
times
of
peril
he
was
a
man
of
iron
but
a
man
of
action
and
passion
too
moving
with
resistless
might
to
rouse
his
powers
mental
or
physical
demanded
indeed
circumstances
of
unusual
import
but
once
roused
they
were
irresistible
such
were
the
personages
now
assembled
in
the
office
of
le
national
and
of
those
five
men
all
were
connected
with
the
press
directly
as
editor
or
proprietor
save
only
ledru
rollin
and
he
was
a
writer
for
la
réforme
as
well
as
an
advocate
the
name
of
louis
blanc
paper
was
as
has
been
said
le
bon
sens
but
to
return
to
the
narrative
and
you
really
wish
a
sermon
from
me
old
comrades
with
patience
as
the
text
aye
aye
aye
exclaimed
all
suppose
i
add
to
it
this
line
i
find
on
the
paper
before
me
on
the
table
that
our
good
marrast
had
just
written
as
the
text
for
a
paragraph
which
would
probably
have
cost
him
another
fine
and
imprisonment
had
the
paragraph
been
completed
and
published
read
read
cried
rollin
with
your
permission
armand
certainly
replied
the
editor
still
continuing
his
promenade
the
house
of
orléans
triumphs
read
louis
blanc
aloud
and
is
it
not
true
the
accursed
tyrants
vociferated
rollin
aye
true
was
the
mild
answer
alas
too
true
that
perfidious
house
does
triumph
and
for
that
very
reason
the
fact
should
never
be
acknowledged
by
its
opponents
rollin
shook
his
head
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
capacious
chair
folded
his
arms
sunk
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
closed
his
eyes
marrast
continued
his
walk
flocon
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
albert
gave
a
significant
smile
oppose
ceaselessly
but
quietly
every
act
of
despotism
this
bourgeois
government
may
attempt
but
be
the
result
what
it
may
never
admit
yourselves
discouraged
depressed
dismayed
defeated
from
every
fall
rise
like
antaeus
with
renewed
vigor
nor
is
it
wise
or
prudent
in
those
engaged
in
a
great
and
glorious
cause
to
provoke
danger
to
brave
penalty
when
nothing
of
good
to
that
cause
can
reasonably
be
expected
prudence
policy
patience
and
perseverance
accomplish
more
than
rashness
yet
are
not
inconsistent
with
intrepidity
boldness
patriotism
and
philanthropy
the
most
exalted
comrades
what
says
the
past
the
past
ten
years
in
whose
events
we
have
all
so
intimately
mingled
shall
i
tell
you
aye
de

said
flocon
we
are
all
sure
of
being
immortal
there
in
that

book
of
yours
eh
louis
cried
rollin
opening
his
large
blue
eyes
louis
blanc
smiled
and
continued
shall
i
convince
you
comrades
by
the
history
of
the
past
ten
years
the
scenes
we
have
all
witnessed
the
events
we
have
all
deplored
the
defeats
we
have
all
sustained
the
insulting
ovations
we
have
all
been
forced
to
behold
and
the
unceasing
triumphs
and
tyranny
of
the
house
of
orléans
that
had
patience
and
prudence
been
our
motto
these
defeats
and
triumphs
would
never
have
been
witnessed
because
these
premature
revolts
would
never
have
been
made
albert
bowed
and
gave
his
peculiar
smile
our
friend
albert
smiles
and
well
he
may
he
has
had
a
sad
experience
in
this
error
of
premature
outbreaks
in
april
he
exerted
every
energy
to
restrain
the
revolt
in
lyons
as
chief
of
the
société
des
droits
de
and
as
the
undoubted
friend
of
the
operatives
but
his
efforts
were
futile
exasperated
urged
on
by
less
experienced
leaders
they
were
in
full
tide
of
revolution
and
could
no
more
be
restrained
in
their
unwise
rising
than
could
the
mountain
cataract
in
mad
career
be
dammed
the
result
was
of
course
defeat
most
disastrous
defeat
hundreds
of
the
people
perished
and
our
friend
was
imprisoned
and
fined
for
taking
part
in
a
movement
which
he
had
in
vain
attempted
to
quell
and
then
with
the
certainty
of
defeat
had
joined
rather
than
desert
the
people
who
trusted
and
relied
on
him
a
noble
act
cried
marrast
as
he
paced
the
room
albert
quietly
smiled
but
otherwise
his
countenance
remained
unmoved
and
was
it
not
a
most
noble
and
a
most
wise
act
continued
the
author
of
the
ten
years
when
our
friend
flocon
by
an
energetic
and
eloquent
harangue
restrained
the
indignant
people
from
razing
to
the
ground
the
office
of
the
de
france
the
organ
of
the
duchess
of
berri
and
his
bitter
foe
terribly
would
that
rash
act
have
recoiled
on
us
and
yet
at
the
same
time
with
this
most
patriotic
and
prudent
deed
before
us
a
wilder
measure
than
even
that
was
adopted
and
it
was
quelled
only
by
force
you
all
remember
the
events
in
february
eugène
brifault
in
his
alluded
jestingly
to
the
mysterious
pregnancy
of
the
mother
of
henry
duke
of
bordeaux
as
did
every
one
she
then
being
imprisoned
at
baye
because
of
her
prior
conspiracy
to
place
her
son
on
the
throne
and
her
secret
marriage
in
italy
being
unrevealed
the
legitimists
of
revenant
challenged
the
allusion
was
repeated
and
a
second
trial
and
a
death
ensued
national
and
tribune
regarding
these
repeated
challenges
as
a
menace
to
the
republicans
hurled
defiance
at
the
legitimists
and
demanded
twelve
distinct
rencontres
in
behalf
of
as
many
names
of
our
friends
posted
at
their
offices
among
which
those
of
armand
carrel
godefroi
cavaignac
and
armand
marrast
were
conspicuous
the
challenge
is
accepted
the
names
of
twelve
legitimists
are
furnished
armand
carrel
selects
roux
laborie
they
fight
and
carrel
is
dangerously
wounded
the
police
then
interfere
the
affair
ends
with
flocon
terrific
and
audacious
defiance
flung
down
at
the
whole
legitimist
and
orléans
parties
in
the
columns
of
réforme
now
what
to
republicans
were
the
quarrels
of
legitimists
and
orléanists
if
we
were
to
be
ruled
by
a
king
what
cared
we
whether
that
king
were
henry
or
louis
philippe
how
would
the
sacrifice
of
carrel
marrast
cavaignac
or
of
any
of
those
twelve
brave
men
have
been
repaid
or
made
up
and
afterwards
alas
in
july
of
when
armand
carrel
causelessly
assuming
a
quarrel
not
his
own
because
of
a
fancied
attempt
to
degrade
the
press
by
rendering
its
issues
accessible
by
cheapness
to
the
masses
was
slain
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
by
the
vulgar
bullet
of
émile
de
girardin
of
presse
what
reparation
to
our
cause
was
it
that
our
champion
had
died
like
a
hero
and
châteaubriand
arago
cormenin
and
béranger
wept
around
his
grave
alas
that
inestimable
life
belonged
to
his
country
and
his
race
and
not
to
himself
to
fling
away
in
an
obscure
quarrel
but
we
are
not
all
of
us
armand
carrels
said
rollin
and
yet
to
the
great
cause
of
human
liberty
and
the
amelioration
of
man
condition
to
which
each
of
us
stands
sworn
are
pledged
our
lives
to
hazard
that
cause
by
the
sacrifice
of
those
lives
or
by
rashly
and
unwisely
attempting
its
advancement
makes
us
violators
of
our
vows
quite
as
much
in
reality
as
if
we
had
become
traitors
but
the
instances
you
cite
are
those
only
of
individual
rashness
louis
and
not
of
the
people
or
of
their
leaders
acting
in
concert
remarked
marrast
true
concert
of
action
has
been
chiefly
needed
but
i
have
only
to
recall
the
dates
and
places
of
our
repeated
attempts
and
defeats
for
the
past
ten
years
to
convince
you
all
that
those
attempts
were
premature
and
had
they
not
been
so
they
might
have
been
successful
that
they
have
frittered
away
energies
which
properly
concentrated
and
directed
might
have
achieved
a
revolution
and
that
while
they
have
betrayed
our
designs
and
depressed
our
friends
have
enabled
our
foes
insultingly
to
triumph
and
caused
them
to
be
on
the
constant
qui
vive
to
anticipate
our
movements
what
but
premature
and
undigested
uprisings
were
the
conspiracy
of
the
of
nôtre
dame
in
january
of
when
national
was
seized
or
the
disturbances
in
la
vendée
or
those
in
grenoble
or
those
in
marseilles
or
those
in
the
rue
des
prouvaires
or
those
in

during
the
cholera
when
casimir
perier
died
or
those
of
the
and
of
june
on
the
occasion
of
general
lamarque
funeral
on
pretence
of
avenging
upon
the
government
the
affront
offered
during
the
obsequies
of
casimir
perier
the
of
the
cholera
for
the
part
taken
by
tribune
then
conducted
by
marrast
in
this
revolt
its
press
was
seized
and
sealed
the
same
was
the
fate
of
quotidienne
and
the
same
would
have
been
the
fate
of
national
but
for
its
barricades
well
do
i
remember
the
meeting
of
our
friends
in
this
very
apartment
on
the
night
after
general
lamarque
funeral
the
great
shade
of
the
venerable
warrior
seemed
among
us
repeating
for
our
counsel
and
imitation
his
last
impressive
words
die
but
the
cause
lives
but
alas
we
observed
it
not
doubt
dissension
dismay
and
despair
were
in
our
midst
all
was
dark
all
was
defiance
and
denunciation
crimination
and
recrimination
brother
hand
raised
against
brother
armand
carrel
that
night
sat
in
this
chair
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
command
his
own
will
or
opinions
how
could
he
then
bring
to
obedience
and
concert
the
conflicting
impulses
of
others
armand
carrel
was
a
wonderful
man
his
motto
like
that
of
danton
was
this
audacity
always
audacity
yet
with
all
the
audacity
of
danton
he
had
little
of
his
firmness
an
officer
under
the
restoration
a
conspirator
at
bifort
in
arms
in
spain
against
the
white
flag
three
times
a
prisoner
before
a
council
of
war
in
he
was
with
thiers
the
founder
of
this
journal
but
everywhere
he
carried
the
exactitude
of
the
camp
even
in
dress
manner
and
bearing
he
was
a
soldier
lofty
haughty
seemingly
overbearing
yet
at
heart
noble
and
generous
and
to
his
friends
accessible
in
the
extreme
to
his
military
notions
nothing
could
be
accomplished
without
soldiers
and
for
the
people
to
carry
a
revolution
against
soldiers
seemed
to
him
absurd
armand
carrel
would
have
been
nevertheless
a
good
revolutionist
louis
said
marrast
but
he
was
a
bad
conspirator
he
had
no
faith
in
the
people
no
confidence
in
the
efforts
of
undisciplined
and
unarmed
masses
and
therein
said
rollin
he
greatly
erred
although
we
can
as
yet
boast
of
having
accomplished
but
very
little
by
them
ledru
added
flocon
with
a
meaning
smile
the
masses
are
easily
roused
but
they
do
stay
roused
and
then
they
often
get
unmanageable
even
by
those
by
whose
summons
they
were
stirred
up
they
fight
well
but
somehow
or
other
they
always
get
beaten
they
succumb
at
last
and
bow
their
necks
to
the
yoke
lower
than
ever
it
is
not
the
people
said
louis
blanc
it
is
we
the
leaders
who
are
to
be
blamed
we
rouse
them
before
we
are
ready
for
them
before
we
have
prepared
them
or
anything
else
for
a
result
and
then
it
is
not
strange
that
they
only
rush
bravely
on
to
death
and
defeat
we
seize
on
the
occasion
of
a
funeral
for
an
outbreak
without
organization
and
the
cuirassiers
of
the
military
escort
trample
our
ranks
beneath
their
horses
hoofs
but
for
unusual
efforts
such
would
have
been
the
case
at
the
funeral
of
dulong
the
deputy
who
fell
in
a
duel
with
general
bugeaud
in
january
of
what
were
the
circumstances
asked
rollin
armand
recollects
them
better
than
i
replied
louis
blanc
the
circumstances
were
these
as
i
remember
them
said
marrast
general
bugeaud
remarked
in
the
course
of
a
speech
in
the
chamber
that
is
always
a
soldier
duty
if
the
order
be
to
become
a
turnkey
asked
dulong
in
allusion
to
the
general
position
in
relation
to
the
duchess
of
berri
during
her
pregnancy
and
confinement
at
baye
armand
carrel
endeavored
to
pacificate
but
the
effort
failed
they
met
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
weapons
were
pistols
the
distance
forty
paces
bugeaud
fired
almost
as
soon
as
he
turned
advancing
only
a
few
steps
his
ball
entered
above
dulong
right
eye
and
at
six
that
evening
he
was
dead
there
was
a
splendid
ball
at
the
tuileries
that
night
was
there
not
asked
flocon
there
was
and
this
with
other
things
excited
in
the
masses
the
idea
that
their
champion
was
the
victim
of
a
royalist
conspiracy
which
all
the
influence
of
armand
carrel
and
dulong
uncle
dupont
de
was
hardly
sufficient
to
suppress
but
dupont
immediately
resigned
his
seat
in
the
chamber
he
would
sit
no
longer
in
a
body
one
man
of
which
he
deemed
the
murderer
of
a
beloved
nephew
the
obsequies
were
grand
armand
carrel
pronounced
the
eulogy
and
two
hundred
and
deputies
wet
the
grave
with
their
tears
the
people
were
greatly
excited
and
as
has
been
said
were
with
great
difficulty
restrained
by
carrel
and
dupont
had
they
been
suffered
to
revolt
the
only
result
which
could
have
followed
would
have
been
a
terrific
outpouring
of
their
blood
furnishing
another
instance
i
suppose
of
the
evil
of
impatience
is
it
not
so
louis
undoubtedly
was
the
reply
and
only
two
months
after
that
other
instance
actually
occurred
for
our
warning
in
the
revolt
at
lyons
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
and
in
which
we
were
all
actors
most
of
us
to
our
sorrow
this
was
in
april
albert
journal
glaneuse
had
been
seized
for
libel
on
the
government
and
the
editor
fined
and
imprisoned
next
a
reform
banquet
of
the
operatives
was
forbidden
although
but
a
year
before
garnier
pages
had
been
suffered
to
banquet
the
lyonnese
to
the
number
of
two
thousand
and
although
at
no
period
had
so
many
gorgeous
festivities
and
public
balls
been
given
by
the
rich
royalists
as
if
in
premeditated
scorn
of
the
banquet
prohibited
to
the
poor
republicans
the
result
was
so
prompt
as
to
seem
inevitable
there
was
a
strike
of
the
operatives
an
insurrection
of
the
people
albert
was
sent
to
paris
as
an
envoy
to
find
a
man
to
lead
the
revolt
mm
cabet
and
pages
were
deemed
too
moderate
cavaignac
would
go
only
with
cabet
lafayette
was
too
feeble
but
gave
his
name
and
letters
carrel
and
marrast
were
not
members
of
the
société
des
droits
de
and
albert
had
been
cautioned
that
carrel
was
too
moderate
thiers
had
denounced
tribune
and
marrast
friends
were
hiding
him
from
the
police
in
despair
concerning
his
mission
the
envoy
was
about
returning
home
when
he
was
sent
for
to
armand
carrel
house
and
carrel
offered
to
go
to
lyons
and
lead
the
revolt
provided
godefroi
cavaignac
would
accompany
him
now
these
friends
had
long
been
at
feud
but
all
private
grievances
were
forgotten
in
this
crisis
of
the
cause
and
albert
is
just
about
preceding
them
in
the
to
announce
their
coming
when
lo
the
telegraph
says
reigns
in
lyons
here
then
after
a
terrific
slaughter
was
recorded
another
fruitless
revolt
because
a
premature
one
nay
it
was
infinitely
worse
than
fruitless
not
only
did
the
republicans
utterly
fail
in
their
attempts
not
only
were
they
cruelly
crushed
by
the
royal
mercenaries
but
they
were
openly
derided
in
their
defeat
and
the
cause
was
gloomier
than
ever
the
slaughter
of
women
and
children
in
the
streets
of
lyons
and
on
their
own
hearthstones
in
the
course
of
this
insurrection
was
hideous
and
is
graphically
portrayed
in
the
memorial
of
our
friend
ledru
rollin
as
advocate
in
the
matter
but
as
if
all
this
were
not
enough
for
our
persecuted
cause
the
decease
of
the
great
and
good
lafayette
the
idol
of
freemen
all
the
world
over
took
place
in
the
following
may
alas
his
sun
went
down
in
clouds
his
end
was
dark
bitter
maledictions
quivered
on
his
dying
lips
he
had
lived
to
mourn
that
july
day
only
three
years
before
when
on
the
steps
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
he
had
with
his
own
hands
been
called
to
invest
a
perfidious
selfish
and
most
ungrateful
tyrant
with
royal
robes
alas
there
was
order
in
lyons
lafayette
was
in
his
grave
peace
reigned
in
paris
the
house
of
orléans
triumphed
those
were
dark
days
said
marrast
sadly
they
were
dear
armand
dark
indeed
for
you
and
your
friends
for
your
journal
had
been
suppressed
and
you
were
an
inmate
with
cavaignac
of
whence
you
both
bravely
and
boldly
effected
your
escape
more
than
a
year
afterwards
and
fled
to
england
to
the
most
glorious
discomfiture
of
the
knaves
who
put
you
there
cried
rollin
vive
la
république
yet
messieurs
we
all
seen
dark
days
and
the
present
is
none
of
the
brightest
and
we
all
come
together
at
these
old
headquarters
of
liberty
just
to
be
unhappy
together
just
to
help
each
other
be
miserable
which
in
fact
is
vastly
happier
unhappiness
than
being
miserable
alone
at
all
events
that
what
i
want
but
it
ca
always
be
right
i
predict
a
revolution
before
another
ten
years
shall
have
rolled
round
which
shall
make
immortals
of
us
all
that
revolution
for
which
we
have
been
waiting
watching
toiling
and
writing
lo
now
these
thirteen
years
and
upward
for
the
which
waiting
watching
toiling
and
writing
we
have
some
of
us
been
fined
who
had
money
enough
to
pay
a
fine
and
others
imprisoned
and
hunted
about
and
persecuted
why
there
albert
and
flocon
have
been
able
to
get
a
franc
cleverly
warm
in
their
pockets
these
ten
years
before
forth
it
was
drawn
in
the
form
of
a
fine
while
as
for
marrast
he
has
the
perfect
air
and
bearing
of
a
bandit
so
often
has
he
seen
the
inside
of
a
dungeon
and
our
friend
albert
is
much
better
looking
as
for
louis
and
myself
why
we
never
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
franc
get
warm
in
our
pockets
so
we
escaped
having
any
drawn
forth
by
ministers
and
they
have
never
thought
us
worth
prosecuting
or
imprisoning
but
they
may
change
their
minds
when
louis
book
that
is
to
make
us
all
immortal
comes
out
eh
louis
louis
blanc
smiled
but
made
no
answer
well
it
is
only
meet
i
suppose
that
i
should
receive
my
share
of
the
blows
said
marrast
i
sure
i
not
very
delicate
or
very
ceremonious
in
bestowing
them
besides
every
one
of
my
predecessors
has
endured
the
same
carrel
thomas
bastide
while
poor
rouen
the
proprietor
would
have
been
ruined
indeed
a
dozen
times
with
fines
but
for
his
enormous
profits
why
this
old
office
has
been
a
perfect
butt
for
ministers
to
fire
at
it
has
received
a
dozen
fusillades
at
least
but
it
stands
yet
and
strange
as
may
have
been
the
scenes
it
has
witnessed
it
will
witness
yet
other
and
stranger
ones
and
we
shall
all
be
witnesses
thereof
and
actors
in
them
too
or
greatly
do
i
err
so
be
it
with
all
our
hearts
was
the
general
shout
apropos
of
state
prosecutions
against
national
said
louis
blanc
that
was
a
most
exciting
time
when
rouen
was
brought
by
thiers
before
the
court
of
peers
for
a
libel
on
that
most
august
and
erudite
body
aye
and
a
most
liberal
honest
and
honorable
conclave
the
and
most
solemn
knaves
and
mules
cried
rollin
rouen
at
the
bar
demanded
armand
carrel
for
his
defence
continued
louis
blanc
to
refuse
was
impossible
but
a
bitter
pill
must
it
have
been
to
thiers
and
mignet
to
consent
they
must
have
foreseen
what
came
both
now
in
the
ministry
only
four
years
before
both
had
been
in
national
thiers
as
the
colleague
of
carrel
and
mignet
as
a
collaborateur
the
files
of
the
journal
were
produced
and
lo
there
stood
paragraphs
proven
to
have
emanated
from
the
pens
of
the
prosecutors
far
more
libelous
and
venomous
on
the
august
peers
than
anything
rouen
had
published
you
all
remember
the
scene
that
ensued
and
wo
forget
it
soon
no
nor
shall
we
soon
forget
that
noble
passage
in
armand
defence
said
flocon
in
which
he
evoked
the
shade
of
marshal
ney
and
from
the
wild
excitement
that
followed
one
would
suppose
that
it
had
really
risen
in
the
hall
bleeding
and
ghastly
and
pointing
to
its
wounds
like
the
ghost
of
banquo
to
blast
his
hoary
jeweled
and
noble
assassin
who
seated
on
those
very
seats
had
sentenced
him
to
an
infamous
doom
carrel
was
instantly
stopped
but
general
excelmens
rose
in
his
seat
and
pronounced
the
charge
true
it
was
then
reiterated
with
tremendous
applause
from
the
galleries
how
carrel
escaped
punishment
for
contempt
is
not
known
rouen
was
convicted
of
libel
on
the
peers
of
course
his
sentence
was
a
fine
of
ten
thousand
francs
and
imprisonment
for
two
years
but
of
what
words
did
this
famous
libel
actually
consist
asked
ledru
rollin
louis
can
tell
you
better
than
i
said
flocon
why
the
words
were
severe
enough
no
doubt
replied
louis
blanc
but
thiers
and
mignet
had
themselves
expressed
the
same
ideas
a
hundred
times
though
in
less
powerful
and
pointed
language
the
passage
which
seems
particularly
to
have
given
offence
was
this
that
in
the
eyes
of
eternal
justice
and
those
of
posterity
as
well
as
in
the
testimony
of
their
own
consciences
these
renegades
from
the
revolution
these
returned
emigrants
these
men
of
ghent
these
military
and
civil
parvenus
these
old
senators
and
spoiled
marshals
of
bonaparte
these
procureur
generals
these
nobles
of
the
restoration
these
three
or
four
generations
of
ministers
sunk
in
public
hatred
and
contempt
and
stained
with
blood
all
these
seasoned
with
a
few
notabilities
thrown
in
by
the
royalty
of
the
of
august
on
condition
they
should
never
open
their
lips
save
to
approve
their
master
commands
all
this
farrago
of
servilities
was
not
competent
to
pronounce
on
the
culpability
of
men
seeking
to
enforce
the
results
of
the
revolution
of
july
it
was
not
until
the
commencement
of
i
think
said
marrast
that
ministers
opened
a
general
onslaught
upon
the
parisian
press
républicain
was
interdicted
that
year
it
was
then
too
that
the
laws
against
public
criers
and
newspaper
hawkers
were
instituted
as
far
back
as
however
rodde
had
braved
all
such
prohibitions
by
selling
and
with
impunity
too
his
own
paper
in
the
streets
in
may
of
came
on
the
general
prosecution
of
the
press
rollin
was
advocate
in
the
defence
there
were
warm
words
between
armand
carrel
and
his
friend
dupont
the
lawyer
and
there
was
at
one
time
apprehension
of
a
duel
the
position
of
armand
carrel
with
thiers
his
former
colleague
was
at
that
time
a
singular
one
remarked
rollin
each
seemed
to
be
on
the
constant
search
for
opportunities
to
exasperate
the
other
the
editor
assailed
the
minister
in
his
columns
and
the
minister
retaliated
by
an
arrest
carrel
censured
and
ridiculed
thiers
though
he
respected
his
abilities
and
thiers
feared
and
hated
carrel
though
he
admired
his
talents
it
was
about
this
time
that
fieschi
exploded
his
infernal
machine
at
the
king
was
it
not
asked
flocon
thiers
arrested
carrel
then
i
know
it
was
on
the
of
july
of
at
ten
in
the
morning
on
the
boulevard
du
temple
this
was
the
second
attempt
on
the
king
life
the
first
having
been
that
of
bergeron
in
november
of
carrel
was
arrested
as
an
accomplice
it
was
pretended
for
every
one
of
these
attempts
has
been
attributed
to
the
whole
body
of
the
republicans
while
they
were
utterly
ignorant
of
them
until
they
took
place
and
then
bitterly
denounced
them
but
the
government
has
made
capital
out
of
all
these
insane
attempts
and
against
the
opposition
too
i
heard
it
asserted
said
rollin
that
the
government
got
up
some
of
those
little
exhibitions
of
fireworks
for
that
very
purpose
they
are
quite
harmless
so
far
as
the
old
man
is
concerned
wonderfully
so
and
fieschi
was
made
a
perfect
fool
of
so
ridiculously
lionized
was
he
by
king
court
and
ministers
our
friend
marie
was
advocate
for
that
wretched
old
man
pépin
fieschi
accomplice
more
a
ghost
than
a
living
creature
you
are
entirely
right
friend
rollin
said
louis
blanc
in
the
idea
that
every
one
of
these
attempts
strengthens
the
government
and
recoils
on
the
opposition
no
one
should
so
vigilantly
and
vigorously
watch
for
and
suppress
such
attempts
as
we
heaven
defend
the
old
despot
from
the
assassin
weapon
as
it
seems
well
inclined
to
do
or
the
deed
will
surely
be
attributed
to
us
every
unsuccessful
attempt
at
assassination
is
viewed
like
an
unsuccessful
attempt
at
revolt
on
the
part
of
the
opposition
and
injures
our
cause
accordingly
better
never
to
attempt
than
never
to
succeed
do
you
think
it
true
louis
as
was
reported
asked
marrast
that
as
soon
as
the
smoke
of
fieschi
explosion
swept
off
and
the
old
man
found
himself
standing
unharmed
amid
a
heap
of
slain
and
mangled
marshal
mortier
and
colonel
rieussec
being
among
the
killed
his
first
exclamation
was
this
with
gratification
i
shall
get
my
appanages
and
the
dotations
for
the
boys
nothing
is
more
probable
said
louis
blanc
that
old
man
has
but
one
impulse
selfishness
and
but
one
attachment
to
his
family
his
family
because
it
is
his
his
purse
and
family
have
for
years
been
his
sole
objects
of
love
to
aggrandize
his
own
has
been
for
years
his
sole
end
and
aim
he
parcels
out
the
thrones
and
kingdoms
of
europe
among
his
children
as
if
it
were
but
a
family
estate
what
thoughtful
selfishness
exclaimed
flocon
and
at
a
moment
too
when
he
had
but
just
escaped
an
awful
death
and
all
around
him
flowed
the
blood
and
lay
scattered
the
lacerated
limbs
of
his
faithful
servants
either
dead
or
dying
with
groans
and
shrieks
of
most
agonizing
torture
and
all
because
of
himself
how
disgraceful
that
at
such
a
terrible
moment
his
first
thought
should
have
been
of
the
few
more
francs
his
trembling
hand
was
striving
to
tear
from
a
people
by
whom
he
had
already
been
made
the
richest
man
in
europe
and
which
the
occurrence
of
this
dreadful
event
might
serve
to
win
for
him
well
said
rollin
whether
this
event
aided
to
win
the
appanages
and
dotations
and
was
so
designed
or
not
it
is
very
sure
the
aforesaid
appanages
and
dotations
were
secured
no
wonder
that
such
attempts
succeed
each
other
so
rapidly
one
every
year
at
the
least
when
was
the
next
louis
that
of
alibaud
i
think
that
took
place
about
sunset
on
the
of
june
was
the
reply
alibaud
discharged
a
at
the
king
as
he
left
the
tuileries
on
his
way
to
neuilly
at
the
corner
of
the
porte
royale
that
alibaud
was
a
mere
boy
and
a
very
interesting
and
intelligent
boy
too
but
for
some
mysterious
cause
he
did
not
find
favor
with
the
court
as
did
fieschi
he
evidently
attempted
the
assassination
from
conviction
from
a
feeling
of
manifest
destiny
after
his
failure
he
only
wished
to
die
and
to
die
at
once
all
who
have
succeeded
alibaud
have
been
but
vulgar
in
what
year
was
the
insurrection
of
armand
barbes
and
martin
bernard
asked
flocon
that
proved
most
disastrous
to
our
cause
that
was
in
may
i
think
answered
rollin
barbes
blanqui
and
bernard
were
arraigned
as
leaders
marie
and
myself
were
advocates
for
barbes
blanqui
was
sentenced
to
death
and
barbes
to
the
galleys
for
life
but
we
obtained
commutation
of
penalty
for
both
and
where
is
to
be
the
end
of
all
these
things
asked
marrast
gloomily
as
he
continued
pacing
the
chamber
with
folded
arms
his
head
resting
on
his
bosom
are
the
ten
years
on
which
we
have
now
entered
to
be
characterized
by
the
fruitless
efforts
of
the
past
are
the
people
of
france
again
and
again
and
again
to
strike
for
freedom
only
to
be
stricken
into
the
dust
and
trampled
beneath
the
armed
heel
of
a
myrmidons
are
the
streets
of
lyons
paris
and
marseilles
again
to
be
drenched
with
the
of
their
dwellers
poured
out
as
freely
as
water
and
as
fruitlessly
are
we
all
again
for
full
ten
years
to
toil
strive
struggle
and
suffer
to
be
hunted
down
like
the
vilest
criminals
and
like
criminals
plunged
into
the
most
pestilential
dungeons
to
be
stripped
like
slaves
of
our
earnings
and
to
be
deprived
of
the
most
humble
franchises
of
men
claiming
at
all
to
be
free
to
be
treated
with
scorn
and
contumely
and
to
be
debarred
the
exercise
of
those
common
rights
which
like
air
and
water
belong
to
all
i
say
brothers
are
all
these
scenes
to
be
repeated
during
the
ten
years
on
which
we
have
now
entered
as
they
have
been
witnessed
during
the
ten
years
now
past
you
speak
sadly
armand
observed
rollin
not
so
sadly
as
i
feel
i
have
listened
with
attention
to
the
recapitulation
of
the
political
events
of
the
past
ten
years
in
france
and
most
plainly
and
as
sadly
as
plainly
does
the
result
prove
that
every
movement
in
our
cause
has
been
as
premature
as
it
has
been
unsuccessful
may
we
not
gather
wisdom
which
shall
conduct
us
to
success
in
the
future
from
the
very
errors
and
disasters
of
the
past
remarked
flocon
alas
despondingly
replied
marrast
what
is
there
in
our
present
to
promise
a
bright
future
more
than
was
in
our
past
to
promise
us
a
bright
present
our
great
leaders
of
another
generation
have
all
left
us
one
after
another
all
have
dropped
into
their
graves
the
cold
marble
has
closed
over
their
venerable
brows
and
they
rest
well
yet
they
died
and
made
no
sign
of
hope
on
us
young
inexperienced
and
rash
has
devolved
their
task
but
the
mantle
of
their
power
and
virtue
has
not
alas
descended
with
that
task
to
aid
in
its
momentous
accomplishment
general
lamarque
sun
went
down
in
clouds
midnight
deeper
than
egyptian
darkness
brooded
over
the
delirious
deathbed
of
lafayette
armand
carrel
fell
without
hope
and
are
we
wiser
than
they
how
often
oh
how
often
have
i
listened
to
the
words
of
wisdom
that
fell
from
those
eloquent
lips
even
as
a
boy
reverently
listens
to
a
parent
for
such
was
armand
carrel
to
me
upon
this
very
spot
have
i
stood
in
that
very
chair
has
he
sat
that
chair
which
with
mingled
shame
and
pride
i
reflect
is
now
filled
by
me
shame
that
it
is
filled
in
a
manner
so
unworthy
of
him
pride
that
i
should
have
been
deemed
fit
after
him
to
fill
it
at
all
in
that
very
chair
i
say
has
his
noble
form
reclined
when
he
for
hours
even
from
night
till
the
next
day
dawn
dwelt
with
sorrowful
eloquence
upon
his
country
present
and
looked
forward
with
gloomy
foreboding
and
prediction
for
the
future
it
almost
seems
to
me
that
this
mighty
shade
is
with
us
now
and
why
was
all
this
despondency
my
dear
armand
remarked
louis
blanc
mildly
was
it
not
because
our
noble
and
gifted
friend
was
essentially
a
soldier
not
a
civilian
not
a
statesman
not
a
revolutionist
had
armand
carrel
gone
to
algeria
he
would
have
died
if
died
he
had
not
in
an
unknown
duel
with
an
unknown
bravo
he
would
have
died
a
marshal
of
france
a
bugeaud
a
chaugarnier
a
bedeau
a
cavaignac
a
clausel
a
lamoricière
carrel
had
no
faith
in
the
masses
to
achieve
a
revolution
he
never
believed
that
they
could
even
withstand
a
single
charge
of
regular
troops
much
less
repel
and
overcome
it
not
even
with
barricades
asked
rollin
not
even
in
defence
of
barricades
continued
louis
blanc
regular
troops
have
much
to
learn
added
rollin
with
a
significant
smile
they
will
see
the
day
aye
and
we
all
shall
see
it
and
rejoice
at
its
coming
despite
all
melancholy
prognostications
when
the
people
of
paris
will
dictate
abdication
to
the
king
of
the
barricades
from
the
top
of
the
barricades
the
people
throne
nor
will
that
event
tarry
long
i
doubt
it
not
i
doubt
it
not
ledru
exclaimed
louis
blanc
rejoiced
that
one
of
the
youngest
and
least
stable
of
their
number
appeared
free
from
the
apprehensions
of
one
of
the
most
influential
and
seemingly
most
reliable
i
accept
the
omen
indicated
by
your
enthusiasm
but
i
accounted
for
the
vacillation
and
distrust
of
our
lamented
friend
armand
carrel
by
reverting
to
the
fact
that
he
relied
entirely
on
regular
troops
military
skill
scientific
tactics
and
severe
subordination
now
all
of
these
belonged
to
our
oppressors
and
none
of
them
to
us
and
inasmuch
as
he
could
not
perceive
that
enthusiasm
passion
for
freedom
love
of
country
and
family
and
the
very
wrath
and
rage
of
desperation
itself
sometimes
not
only
supply
the
place
of
discipline
arms
and
the
knowledge
requisite
to
use
them
but
even
enable
vast
masses
to
break
down
and
crush
beneath
their
heel
the
serried
ranks
of
veteran
troops
he
could
only
despair
at
the
prospects
apparently
before
him
besides
armand
carrel
like
all
military
men
was
a
man
of
action
not
reflection
of
execution
not
contrivance
a
soldier
not
a
conspirator
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
veteran
troops
he
would
have
charged
on
thrice
their
number
without
discipline
with
the
confident
assurance
of
sweeping
them
from
his
path
as
the
chaff
of
the
threshing
floor
is
swept
before
the
blast
but
with
an
undisciplined
mob
as
he
contemptuously
called
the
masses
he
would
have
moved
not
a
step
the
larger
the
multitude
the
less
effective
and
the
more
impossible
to
manage
he
would
have
deemed
it
a
revolution
accomplished
by
means
of
the
three
arms
of
the
military
service
artillery
cavalry
and
infantry
horse
foot
and
dragoons
he
could
readily
conceive
but
a
revolution
conducted
to
a
successful
issue
only
by
means
of
pikes
axes
muskets
and
barricades
never
to
the
hour
of
his
death
despite
the
victory
of
the
three
days
could
carrel
comprehend
besides
said
flocon
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
armand
carrel
though
a
most
devoted
friend
to
republicanism
was
never
a
member
of
the
société
des
droits
de
was
never
as
we
all
now
are
a
communist
a
socialist
a
fourierist
a
friend
to
the
laborer
no
wonder
he
hoped
so
little
for
the
people
and
trusted
to
accomplish
so
little
through
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
social
principle
which
republicanism
is
now
unconsciously
assuming
all
over
france
mildly
remarked
louis
blanc
is
lending
to
the
cause
incalculable
strength
how
terribly
impressed
with
a
conviction
of
the
justice
of
the
cause
in
which
they
perished
must
have
been
the
unhappy
insurgents
of
lyons
when
with
this
motto
on
their
banner
live
toiling
or
die
fighting
they
marched
firmly
up
to
the
cannon
mouth
and
fought
and
thus
fighting
fell
yet
this
conviction
is
not
peculiar
to
the
workmen
of
lyons
it
pervades
all
paris
all
france
and
needs
only
to
be
roused
to
act
with
an
energy
which
no
human
power
can
resist
social
republican
will
be
the
type
of
the
next
revolution
in
france
it
must
be
the
french
people
have
been
dazzled
by
the
mirage
of
liberty
ever
since
but
it
has
been
only
a
mirage
on
the
last
three
days
of
july
the
people
of
paris
drove
out
one
bourbon
to
enthrone
another
true
state
is
myself
was
not
the
despotic
motto
he
assumed
as
did
one
of
his
successors
but
it
was
and
my
family
which
has
proved
equally
selfish
if
not
so
absolute
and
far
more
dangerous
to
freedom
with
lafayette
and
benjamin
constant
the
citizen
king
they
had
made
quarreled
as
soon
as
on
his
throne
and
lafitte
and
dupont
de
his
supporters
were
banished
from
the
court
casimir
perier
was
called
to
crush
the
liberals
armand
carrel
assailed
the
act
and
urged
a
republic
national
was
prosecuted
and
insurrections
followed
thus
was
the
revolution
of
the
three
days
won
by
the
people
to
be
seized
and
enjoyed
by
the
bourgeoisie
the
next
revolution
will
be
won
by
the
people
too
but
the
people
will
enjoy
it
and
how
progresses
our
principles
louis
among
the
people
asked
marrast
who
had
listened
attentively
to
every
word
that
had
been
uttered
never
so
gloriously
as
now
armand
never
never
has
there
been
such
a
diffusion
of
information
upon
the
subject
of
the
rights
of
labor
as
now
pagnerre
tells
me
every
day
that
volumes
tracts
and
pamphlets
on
this
topic
disappear
like
magic
from
his
shelves
has
not
the
minister
a
hand
in
this
mysterious
disappearance
of
communist
literature
asked
rollin
we
all
know
he
is
quite
frantic
on
the
topic
of
popular
education
oh
yes
we
all
understand
guizot
love
for
the
people
his
system
of
education
promulgated
in
was
so
very
beautiful
that
it
was
almost
a
pity
it
was
utterly
impracticable
but
guizot
has
very
little
to
do
with
pagnerre
or
with
pagnerre
in
any
way
except
to
prosecute
him
from
time
to
time
for
publishing
cormenin
withering
tracts
designed
for
the
minister
himself
and
yet
it
would
almost
seem
there
was
a
design
to
exhaust
the
market
of
the
publications
of
our
friends
only
the
great
mass
of
them
go
to
the
provinces
and
large
quantities
abroad
my
own
little
brochure
organization
of
work
after
having
fallen
stillborn
from
the
press
died
a
natural
death
and
been
laid
out
in

a
year
or
two
on
pagnerre
shelves
all
at
once
is
resurrected
runs
through
half
a
dozen
large
editions
and
is
translated
into
half
a
dozen
languages
the
same
is
true
of
of
the
future
and
the
same
of
cormenin
tracts
and
of
the
ten
thousand
brochures
on
this
same
subject
of
communism
in
all
its
different
shades
and
phrases
and
in
every
variety
of
size
form
and
style
of
writing
and
appearance
these
publications
are
adapted
to
every
taste
and
comprehension
the
workman
is
suited
as
well
as
the
savant
all
this
savors
of
magic
even
my
most
sanguine
anticipations
are
surpassed
by
reality
there
will
never
long
lack
a
supply
for
a
demand
be
that
demand
what
it
may
a
demand
for
fourier
literature
has
turned
all
the
pens
in
paris
hard
at
work
upon
it
novelists
essayists
pamphleteers
while
the
porte
antoine
the
porte
martin
and
all
the
minor
theatres
where
are
found
the
masses
swarm
with
melodramas
farces
and
vaudevilles
on
the
same
subject
and
none
of
you
have
forgotten
the
powerful
play
entitled
laborer
of
lyons
attributed
to
dantès
recently
produced
with
such
success
on
the
boards
of
the
français
itself
and
who
is
this
dantès
asked
ledru
rollin
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
interrupt
decidedly
the
most
remarkable
man
in
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
replied
marrast
in
powers
of
natural
eloquence
i
never
saw
his
rival
nor
is
that
all
added
louis
blanc
unlike
most
men
noted
as
mere
orators
he
is
a
sound
logician
as
well
as
a
polished
rhetorician
as
a
political
economist
he
has
few
equals
to
that
subject
he
seems
to
have
devoted
much
study
while
his
familiarity
with
the
political
history
of
france
and
of
the
times
generally
all
over
christendom
seems
boundless
in
debate
you
observe
he
is
never
at
a
loss
for
fact
or
argument
let
the
discussion
take
what
direction
it
may
and
he
has
celebrity
also
as
a
writer
has
he
not
asked
ledru
rollin
the
author
of
laborer
of
lyons
must
be
a
man
of
distinguished
literary
genius
was
the
reply
better
than
all
said
flocon
he
is
devoted
heart
and
soul
to
the
good
cause
such
devotedness
to
a
cause
i
never
witnessed
said
marrast
he
puts
us
all
to
the
blush
with
him
it
appears
a
matter
of
direct
individual
interest
he
is
perfectly
untiring
he
is
like
one
impelled
by
his
fate
love
or
vengeance
could
not
force
onward
a
man
to
the
attainment
of
an
object
more
irresistibly
than
he
seems
forced
and
that
too
without
the
slightest
apparent
stain
of
personal
interest
or
ambition
that
man
appears
to
me
a
miracle
a
pure
philanthropist
he
strives
struggles
suffers
sacrifices
and
all
with
the
sole
object
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
his
race
it
is
indeed
wonderful
said
rollin
thoughtfully
do
you
know
marrast
anything
of
his
past
history
little
if
anything
of
himself
he
never
speaks
and
i
can
gather
nothing
from
others
even
his
constituents
had
known
nothing
of
him
but
a
few
months
before
he
became
their
representative
in
the
chamber
his
popularity
with
them
he
owes
to
his
efforts
to
ameliorate
their
condition
at
his
own
expense
he
established
among
them
a
phalanstrie

is
now
in
most
successful
operation
he
is
rich
then
asked
flocon
seemingly
not
to
judge
from
his
habits
of
life
replied
marrast
not
a
man
in
the
chamber
is
more
republican
in
garb
manner
equipage
or
residence
than
he
and
yet
he
may
be
rich
is
he
married
asked
rollin
he
has
been
i
am
told
said
marrast
but
we
interrupt
you
louis
you
were
alluding
to
the
unusual
influences
now
at
work
for
our
cause
i
was
about
speaking
of
the
newspaper
press
said
louis
blanc
never
has
there
been
known
such
a
revolution
in
favor
of
reform
and
communist
journals
and
to
none
is
this
better
known
than
to
some
of
ourselves
there
flocon
new
journal
réforme
that
has
leaped
at
once
into
a
circulation
never
before
achieved
but
by
long
years
of
toil
and
enterprise
the
old
we
need
but
to
look
around
us
to
be
sure
was
never
more
prosperous
than
now
while
i
am
free
to
confess
that
my
journal
bon
sens
which
has
been
a
sickly
child
ever
since
its
birth
has
within
three
months
tripled
its
number
of
readers
or
at
least
its
payers
the
same
is
in
the
main
true
of
monde
by
la
croix
journal
du
peuple
by
dubose
courier
français
by
chatelain
commerce
by
bert
minerve
by
lemaine
presse
by
girardin
and
all
the
journals
in
paris
which
diffuse
true
ideas
upon
labor
and
the
rights
of
the
people
be
they
in
other
respects
what
they
may
even
the
which
views
the
old
king
and
his
ministers
as
fair
butts
of
ridicule
perceives
a
marked
increase
in
its
patronage
since
it
commenced
that
course
which
sudden
popularity
naturally
excites
it
to
increase
of
zeal
in
the
same
path
besides
all
this
an
army
of
new
papers
aiming
to
aid
the
great
cause
have
not
only
sprung
up
of
late
like
mushrooms
in
paris
but
all
over
france
and
even
all
over
europe
and
so
far
appear
they
from
interfering
with
each
other
prospects
that
the
more
there
are
the
better
they
seem
sustained
and
the
more
ably
conducted
a
swarm
of
new
and
unknown
writers
for
the
press
on
this
great
subject
seems
all
at
once
to
have
appeared
from
unseen
this
is
very
strange
louis
said
marrast
and
yet
it
is
doubtless
very
true
i
had
observed
what
you
remark
myself
although
i
have
viewed
the
movement
less
hopefully
for
the
cause
of
the
republic
than
you
depend
upon
it
armand
said
louis
blanc
smiling
that
republicanism
and
socialism
are
identical
terms
as
much
so
as
communism
and
despotism
are
antagonistic
terms
but
how
do
you
account
for
this
wonderful
change
this
unprecedented
fever
for
fourierism
asked
flocon
i
do
pretend
to
account
for
it
at
all
the
merits
of
the
cause
have
perhaps
begun
to
be
properly
appreciated
unusual
efforts
have
been
made
by
our
friends
of
late
whole
nations
and
epochs
are
sometimes
seized
with
a
contagious
mania
for
peculiar
species
of
literature
as
for
everything
else
but
i
will
hint
to
you
a
suspicion
which
i
have
recently
entertained
namely
that
after
all
the
rapid
sale
and
ready
market
for
every
species
of
fourier
literature
is
not
an
unerring
indication
of
the
amount
of
reading
of
such
literature
or
the
demand
that
actually
exists
of
buyers
as
well
as
readers
individual
ones
at
least
as
for
the
journalistic
literature
that
i
have
learned
is
without
doubt
gratuitously
distributed
to
a
great
extent
among
the
masses
but
can
the
masses
read
the
papers
asked
marrast
each
family
house
neighborhood
café
or
cabaret
at
any
rate
has
at
least
one
reader
said
rollin
and
all
the
men
women
and
children
have
ears
to
hear
if
not
power
to
comprehend
but
some
of
these
papers
which
i
have
seen
come
down
in
style
to
the
very
humblest
comprehension
can
it
be
asked
flocon
that
there
is
such
a
club
as
a
society
for
the
diffusion
of
social
knowledge
in
paris
after
the
form
of
that
in
london
instituted
by
lord
henry
brougham
and
his
whig
coadjutors
for
the
diffusion
of
general
information
and
so
opposed
by
the
tories
if
there
be
such
an
association
said
louis
blanc
it
has
managed
to
elude
all
my
vigilance
thus
far
and
that
of
the
government
too
for
guizot
can
perceive
if
no
one
else
can
the
inevitable
effect
of
all
this
and
he
has
no
idea
that
the
dear
people
of
france
shall
be
educated
by
any
one
save
himself
but
actually
there
seems
to
me
to
exist
too
much
unity
of
purpose
and
action
in
this
enterprise
for
it
to
be
the
work
of
an
association
i
should
rather
suppose
one
powerful
and
philanthropic
mind
at
the
head
of
the
movement
were
there
not
two
things
so
plainly
opposed
to
it
as
to
forbid
the
idea
the
first
being
that
there
is
no
one
man
in
europe
who
is
rich
enough
to
expend
such
immense
sums
upon
such
an
enterprise
if
he
would
and
the
second
that
there
is
no
man
who
has
the
subject
sufficiently
at
heart
to
do
it
if
he
could
chapter
xi
wait
and
hope
just
then
a
light
rap
was
heard
at
the
private
door
which
marrast
immediately
hastened
to
open
as
if
in
anticipation
of
the
arrival
of
a
friend
a
brief
and
rapid
colloquy
ensued
then
dantès
the
deputy
from
marseilles
was
introduced
he
seemed
acquainted
with
and
to
be
held
in
high
regard
by
all
present
his
dress
as
usual
was
black
with
a
white
cravat
and
his
manner
and
bearing
had
all
that
magnetism
and
dignity
which
so
deeply
impressed
those
he
met
i
find
you
in
private
conference
do
i
not
messieurs
asked
he
glancing
around
with
a
smile
i
pray
you
let
me
not
interrupt
i
have
called
but
for
a
moment
to
speak
with
marrast
respecting
a
measure
in
the
chamber
and
have
consented
to
enter
only
at
his
solicitation
you
are
right
dantès
replied
marrast
in
supposing
us
engaged
in
a
private
conference
and
upon
matters
of
deep
import
though
conferences
in
this
office
can
never
be
so
private
or
so
important
as
not
to
derive
benefit
from
the
presence
and
counsel
of
the
deputy
from
marseilles
most
true
observed
louis
blanc
and
so
far
from
intrusion
do
we
view
your
arrival
that
we
can
but
consider
it
most
opportune
that
we
have
the
privilege
of
referring
to
you
a
question
on
which
between
us
especially
between
our
friend
marrast
and
myself
there
seems
some
little
diversity
of
sentiment
it
would
i
fear
said
dantès
be
unpardonable
arrogance
in
one
so
young
as
i
am
in
the
great
cause
of
human
liberty
to
offer
counsel
to
you
who
are
all
veterans
and
most
of
you
little
less
than
martyrs
to
your
enthusiasm
but
no
good
citizen
will
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
declaring
the
results
of
his
reflections
on
all
topics
which
have
reference
to
the
general
weal
we
differ
mainly
in
this
said
marrast
louis
blanc
attributes
the
republican
failures
of
the
past
ten
years
to
prematurity
and
want
of
preparation
in
our
attempts
and
contends
that
all
those
reverses
may
be
retrieved
by
patience
and
prudence
in
future
while
to
my
mind
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
for
the
future
from
the
same
causes
different
results
than
those
experienced
in
the
past
concert
of
action
said
dantès
mildly
is
always
an
indispensable
requisite
in
the
accomplishment
of
every
enterprise
which
relies
for
its
success
on
association
or
the
combined
efforts
of
individuals
laboring
for
a
common
end
yet
with
all
the
concert
of
action
which
can
possibly
be
attained
the
best
arranged
and
best
digested
scheme
in
the
world
may
be
ruined
by
premature
movement
of
this
we
surely
have
sad
proof
in
the
history
of
the
past
ten
years
alluded
to
there
is
something
of
truth
in
the
declaration
so
frequently
made
that
the
french
people
are
not
yet
prepared
for
freedom
if
this
be
so
then
it
is
the
duty
of
their
friends
to
prepare
them
it
is
folly
to
suppose
that
the
masses
should
at
first
intuitively
know
all
their
rights
and
the
best
mode
of
vindicating
them
this
they
must
be
taught
and
to
this
end
the
press
should
be
unceasingly
at
work
not
only
all
over
france
but
all
over
europe
in
diffusing
correct
views
upon
life
and
labor
and
political
rights
and
powers
there
should
be
also
concert
of
action
among
the
friends
of
freedom
and
clubs
should
at
once
be
instituted
in
every
city
town
and
village
in
france
which
should
be
in
private
and
intimate
correspondence
with
similar
clubs
at
paris
and
in
all
the
capitals
of
christendom
there
should
likewise
be
unity
of
action
introduced
among
the
masses
themselves
in
a
city
like
paris
and
among
a
people
like
the
french
secret
signals
can
easily
be
arranged
by
which
at
any
hour
of
the
night
or
of
the
day
fifty
thousand
laborers
in
their
blouses
might
be
concentrated
at
any
point
where
their
presence
is
required
and
that
too
with
arms
in
their
hands
furnished
from
secret
arsenals
and
thus
would
those
pitiable
slaughters
of
helpless
insurgents
like
those
of
sheep
in
the
shambles
we
have
so
often
witnessed
be
avoided
if
nothing
besides
were
gained
the
people
are
ever
but
too
ready
to
pour
out
their
blood
and
the
most
difficult
and
delicate
task
in
our
enterprise
is
after
all
to
restrain
them
to
impress
upon
them
the
all
important
maxim
without
which
nothing
great
good
or
enduring
is
achieved
those
three
words
in
which
all
human
wisdom
is
contained
and
hope
and
for
what
are
we
to
wait
and
hope
for
which
we
have
not
already
in
vain
waited
and
hoped
the
past
ten
years
asked
marrast
the
true
hour
to
strike
was
the
firm
answer
and
that
hour
when
will
it
come
it
may
come
quickly
as
it
will
come
surely
soon
or
late
it
can
not
be
that
the
revolution
of
july
should
continue
much
longer
to
result
in
the
solemn
mockery
it
has
it
can
not
be
that
its
friends
should
much
longer
be
withheld
from
those
by
whom
it
was
achieved
only
to
aggrandize
one
old
man
and
his
sons
it
can
not
be
that
the
unmitigated
and
disgusting
selfism
of
louis
philippe
and
his
efforts
to
ally
himself
with
every
crowned
head
in
europe
not
for
the
glory
of
france
but
for
his
own
will
much
longer
be
overlooked
or
their
perils
masked
the
appanages
grasped
by
himself
the
dotation
and
bridal
outfit
of
the
duke
of
orléans
the
dotation
sought
for
the
duke
of
nemours
and
his
appointment
as
regent
during
the
minority
of
the
count
of
paris
the
governorship
of
algeria
bestowed
on
the
youthful
and
inexperienced
aumale
to
the
insult
of
so
many
brave
and
victorious
generals
the
naval
supremacy
to
which
has
been
exalted
the
ambitious
joinville
and
his
union
to
the
opulent
brazilian
princess
the
effort
to
unite
the
young
montpensier
with
the
infanta
of
spain
the
environment
of
paris
with
bastilles
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
fortifying
order
by
turning
the
ordnance
which
should
protect
into
enginery
of
destruction
an
immense
standing
army
the
notorious
corruption
of
officials
and
the
audacious
dabbling
of
ministers
in
the
stocks
if
not
the
king
himself
by
means
of
information
obtained
by
the
government
telegraph
and
withheld
from
the
people
or
of
information
manufactured
by
the
telegraph
designed
to
affect
the
bourse
the
unprecedented
number
of
placemen
occupying
seats
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
yet
receiving
exorbitant
salaries
as
incumbents
of
civil
offices
one
man
being
often
in
receipt
of
the
salaries
of
several
offices
though
performing
the
duties
of
none
the
fact
that
ministers
have
maintained
majorities
by
unblushing
bribery
in
elections
that
hardly
one
man
in
two
hundred
is
an
elector
the
profligate
arts
of
corruption
by
which
every
able
man
is
bought
by
the
court
the
disgraceful
censorship
of
the
press
and
the
drama
the
enormous
appropriations
for
the
civil
list
wrung
out
by
grinding
taxes
from
the
toil
and
sweat
of
millions
the
absurd
assumption
yet
the
monstrous
power
over
the
press
and
its
conductors
of
that
conclave
of
hoary
dotards
called
the
chamber
of
peers
the
utter
and
most
impious
disregard
of
the
deprivation
and
misery
of
the
operative
and
laborer
although
arrayed
side
by
side
with
the
insolence
and
wealth
pampered
by
the
taxes
torn
from
themselves
the
total
forgetfulness
of
the
truth
of
the
right
of
all
men
to
labor
unrestricted
by
the
baleful
influences
of
the
competition
of
capitalists
these
facts
properly
urged
and
set
forth
by
the
press
from
the
tribune
and
in
the
clubs
in
connection
with
due
enlightenment
of
the
masses
upon
their
rights
as
to
labor
and
its
reward
and
the
duty
of
government
thereupon
could
not
fail
to
prepare
the
popular
mind
all
over
france
and
all
over
europe
for
reform
for
revolution
unquestionably
cried
louis
blanc
such
would
be
the
effect
and
it
would
not
only
prepare
the
people
for
reform
and
stimulate
them
to
obtain
it
but
it
would
make
them
republicans
true
republicans
american
republicans
the
americans
do
not
plume
themselves
on
the
title
citizen
but
they
work
they
dispute
little
about
words
but
clear
their
lands
they
do
not
talk
of
exterminating
anybody
but
they
cover
the
sea
with
their
ships
they
construct
immense
canals
roads
and
steamers
without
jabbering
at
every
stroke
of
the
spade
about
the
rights
of
man
with
them
labor
merit
talent
and
honest
opulence
are
honored
and
rewarded
aristocracies
such
republicans
would
furnish
france
more
washingtons
jeffersons
and
madisons
and
fewer
robespierres
dantons
and
marats
there
can
be
no
doubt
remarked
flocon
that
the
paramount
interest
in
a
republic
is
that
of
those
who
work
that
the
labor
question
is
of
supreme
importance
that
the
profound
problem
now
submitted
to
the
industrial
nations
of
christendom
demands
satisfactory
solution
and
that
the
and
most
iniquitous
miseries
of
those
who
toil
must
cease
reform
revolution
and
government
which
achieve
not
these
achieve
nothing
they
would
be
worse
than
useless
the
measures
suggested
by
our
distinguished
friend
seem
to
me
eminently
calculated
to
attain
the
consummation
we
desire
a
good
government
must
and
always
will
systematically
uphold
the
poor
and
ever
interpose
to
protect
the
weak
against
the
strong
said
louis
blanc
the
state
should
be
tutelary
for
the
ignorant
the
poor
and
the
suffering
of
every
description
we
must
have
a
guardian
government
a
government
that
will
accord
the
aid
of
that
mighty
engine
credit
not
to
the
rich
only
but
also
to
the
poor
it
must
interpose
likewise
in
the
matter
of
industry
and
exclude
that
antagonistical
principle
of
competition
the
poisoned
fount
of
so
much
virulence
violence
and
ruin
our
maxim
is
brothers
and
in
this
do
we
all
concur
solidarity
and
our
motto
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
all
men
are
of
one
family
and
once
thoroughly
sensible
of
this
kindred
discord
hate
and
selfism
will
no
longer
be
possible
the
views
advanced
said
ledru
rollin
so
far
as
they
tend
to
the
elevation
of
the
masses
and
to
popular
preparation
for
reform
republicanism
or
revolution
have
my
most
cordial
approval
but
i
would
beg
to
ask
how
long
are
the
people
to
and
hope
when
is
to
come
the
hour
to
strike
who
can
tell
said
dantès
in
his
low
clear
and
musical
tones
at
what
moment
the
breath
will
come
which
may
hurl
on
its
errand
of
devastation
the
avalanche
which
the
snows
and
suns
of
centuries
perchance
have
been
preparing
for
its
awful
mission
in
the
stillness
of
the
beneath
the
clear
blue
sky
of
summer
or
amid
the
ravings
of
the
midnight
tempest
its
dread
march
is
ordered
and
in
resistless
crushing
sublimity
it
begins
to
move
on
to
accomplish
its
terrible
errand
who
may
predict
the
precise
moment
when
the
earthquake
shall
rock
the
tornado
sweep
the
red
lightning
scathe
or
the
lava
flood
desolate
and
who
shall
tell
the
day
or
the
hour
when
the

i
subscribe

chapter
xii
the
mysterious
prima
donna
all
fashionable
paris
was
excited
over
the
announcement
of
a
new
prima
donna
whose
wonderful
achievements
in
italian
opera
had
set
even
the
exacting
critics
of
italy
wild
with
enthusiasm
and
delight
this
great
artiste
was
no
other
than
the
renowned
louise
she
had
never
before
sung
in
the
presence
of
a
parisian
audience
but
her
fame
had
preceded
her
and
it
was
accepted
as
certain
that
her
triumph
at
the
académie
royale
would
be
both
instantaneous
and
overwhelming
she
was
to
assume
the
rôle
of
lucrezia
borgia
in
donizetti
brilliant
opera
of
that
name
a
rôle
in
which
the
enterprising
director
of
the
académie
royale
assured
the
expectant
public
that
she
possessed
no
equal
for
weeks
every
parisian
journal
had
been
sounding
her
praises
with
unremitting
zeal
and
now
her
name
was
as
familiar
as
a
household
word
in
all
the
high
society
salons
where
the
ladies
and
their
gallants
could
talk
of
nothing
but
the
approaching
operatic
event
while
in
the
cafés
and
on
the
boulevards
an
equal
degree
of
interest
was
exhibited
even
the
masses
notwithstanding
the
political
agitation
in
which
they
were
involved
had
caught
the
prevailing
excitement
and
the
leaders
of
the
contending
parties
themselves
paused
amid
their
heated
discussions
to
talk
of
louise
the
career
of
this
young
and
beautiful
artiste
had
been
remarkable
her
début
had
been
made
at
brussels
about
two
years
before
in
company
with
her
brother
léon
and
there
as
well
as
at
all
the
theatres
of
italy
la
scala
argentina
and
valle
they
had
roused
a
perfect
storm
of
operatic
enthusiasm
the
origin
of
this
young
artiste
was
veiled
in
the
deepest
mystery
rumor
ascribed
to
her
descent
from
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
respectable
families
of
france
and
domestic
trials
among
which
was
a
matrimonial
misadventure
no
less
than
the
arrest
of
an
italian
prince
whom
she
was
about
to
wed
on
the
bridal
night
as
an
escaped
galley
slave
were
assigned
as
the
cause
which
had
given
her
splendid
powers
to
the
stage
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
for
parisian
fashion
never
fills
the
until
the
curtain
falls
on
the
second
act
the
rue
lepelletier
was
crowded
with
carriages
la
pinon
with
fiacres
and
the
grande
batelière
and
the
passages
to
the
boulevard
des
italiens
with
persons
on
foot
all
hastening
toward
that
magnificent
edifice
constructed
within
the
space
of
a
single
year
by
debret
to
replace
the
building
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
ordered
to
be
razed
by
the
government
because
of
the
assassination
at
its
door
of
the
duke
of
berri
in
that
magnificent
structure
which
accommodates
two
thousand
spectators
with
seats
among
the
first
in
the
orchestra
stalls
were
beauchamp
and
debray
whose
attention
was
divided
between
the
stage
and
the
arrivals
of
splendidly
attired
elégantes
in
the
different
loges
during
the
overture
all
the
élite
of
paris
seemed
on
the
qui
vive
it
will
be
a
splendid
house
observed
debray
the
débutante
be
she
whom
she
may
should
feel
flattered
by
such
an
unexampled
assemblage
of
all
the
ton
of
paris
orchestra
balcony
galleries
amphitheatres
lobbies
and
parterre
were
packed
every
portion
of
the
vast
edifice
in
short
was
thronged
except
a
few
of
the
loges
and
baignoires
into
which
every
moment
brilliant
companies
were
entering
who
is
that
tall
dark
military
man
with
the
heavy
moustache
now
making
his
way
into
the
minister
box
asked
beauchamp
after
a
pause
that
man
is
no
less
a
personage
than
the
governor
of
algeria
eugène
cavaignac
marshal
of
camp
said
debray
he
reported
himself
at
the
war
office
this
morning
and
is
the
lion
of
the
house
ah
cried
the
journalist
and
that
is
the
hero
of
constantine
what
a
frank
open
countenance
and
what
a
distingué
bearing
and
manner
you
would
not
suppose
all
that
man
life
passed
in
a
camp
would
you
his
career
has
i
understand
been
remarkable
said
beauchamp
very
his
father
was
a
conventionist
of
a
famous
old
fellow
who
among
other
terrible
things
laid
at
his
door
is
said
to
have
pawned
an
old
man
life
old
labodère
for
his
daughter
honor
somewhat
you
remember
as
francis
spared
valliar
life
for
the
favor
of
the
lovely
diana
of
poitiers
his
only
child
his
aged
mother
is
yet
living
a
woman
of
strong
mind
though
seventy
and
he
does
nothing
without
her
advice
his
brother
godefroi
name
was
notorious
as
that
of
a
powerful
republican
leader
for
years
before
his
decease
at
eighteen
eugène
entered
the
polytechnic
school
at
he
was
a
in
the
engineer
corps
of
the
second
regiment
in
he
was
first
lieutenant
in
france
in
he
was
captain
in
he
was
in
algeria
and
in
his
cool
bold
decided
but
discreet
conduct
had
made
him
chef
de
bataillon
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
incurred
the
royal
displeasure
some
years
before
by
a
disloyal
toast
at
a
banquet
in
he
was
in
marshal
of
camp
and
first
commander
of
division
of
tlemeen
in
he
was
conqueror
of
constantine
at
the
first
siege
of
which
i
so
nearly
lost
my
own
valuable
head
and
he
is
now
governor
of
algeria
after
service
there
of
fourteen
years
and
the
tall
and
sinewy
man
beside
him
presenting
such
a
contrast
to
cavaignac
with
his
light
complexion
gray
hair
and
sullen
and
not
very
intelligent
expression
oh
that
is
general
bugeaud
by
some
deemed
the
real
conqueror
of
algeria
but
he
not
at
all
popular
with
the
army
his
manners
are
simple
and
excessively
blunt
he
is
a
perfect
despot
with
his
staff
said
yet
he
is
quite
a
wag
when
in
and
at
ministerial
dinners
can
unbend
and
make
himself
as
agreeable
as
need
be
wished
his
voice
is
as
harsh
as
a
cossack
and
in
perfect
contrast
to
that
of
cavaignac
which
is
the
richest
and
most
musical
you
ever
heard
yet
distinct
emphatic
and
impressive
bugeaud
incurred
intense
odium
with
the
opposition
for
his
unwarranted
severity
as
jailor
of
the
duchess
of
berri
in
and
his
killing
dulong
in
a
duel
because
of
a
deserved
taunt
on
the
subject
bugeaud
did
his
duty
said
the
secretary
though
a
man
of
his
nature
could
hardly
perform
such
a
duty
with
gentleness
bugeaud
is
not
a
gentleman
he
knows
it
and
do
try
to
seem
one
he
is
only
a
soldier
but
there
comes
his
very
particular
foe
general
lamoricière
that
magnificent
woman
on
his
arm
is
his
wife
and
the
sister
of
the
lady
who
follows
with
her
husband
the
adolphe
thiers
what
a
contrast
cried
beauchamp
the
tall
and
elegant
figure
of
lamoricière
in
his
brilliant
uniform
of
the
spahis
half
oriental
half
french
with
his
lovely
wife
and
the
low
swarthy
little
in
complete
black
with
his
huge
round
spectacles
on
his
nose
nearly
twice
the
size
of
his
eyes
and
a
wife
on
his
arm
nearly
double
his
stature
why
thiers
reminds
me
of
a
ghoul
gallanting
a
peri
and
yet
that
same
dark
little
has
perhaps
in
many
respects
the
most
powerful
mind
at
all
events
the
most
available
mind
impelled
as
it
is
by
his
restless
ambition
in
all
france
do
you
observe
how
incessantly
his
keen
black
eye
flashes
around
the
house
beneath
his
huge
glasses
he
seems
perfectly
aware
that
every
eye
in
the
house
is
directed
toward
his
loge
but
is
it
true
that
his
owes
his
rapid
rise
to
his
influence
at
court
by
no
means
replied
debray
if
there
is
a
man
in
the
french
army
who
has
achieved
his
own
fortunes
that
man
is
lamoricière
he
went
to
algeria
a
lieutenant
and
bravely
and
gallantly
has
he
attained
his
present
brilliant
position
it
was
he
who
proposed
the
creation
of
a
corps
of
native
arab
troops
like
the
sepoys
of
british
india
and
he
was
appointed
colonel
of
the
first
regiment
of
spahis
our
quondam
friend
maximilian
morrel
has
a
command
in
this
regiment
and
is
a
protégé
of
his
illustrious
exemplar
the
hostility
between
lamoricière
and
bugeaud
arises
i
suppose
from
the
latter
detestable
disposition
his
overbearing
and
dictatorial
temper
lamoricière
is
not
a
man
i
take
it
to
be
the
slave
of
any
one
rivalry
in
africa
is
thought
to
have
originated
the
feud
remarked
debray
and
political
differences
in
paris
to
have
inflamed
it
bugeaud
is
a
legitimist
and
lamoricière
a
republican
silence
cried
the
musical
connoisseurs
in
the
orchestra
the
curtain
rises
as
the
curtain
rose
a
hush
of
expectation
reigned
over
the
audience
the
hum
and
bustle
ceased
and
silence
most
profound
succeeded
the
appearance
of
the
fair
cantatrice
was
the
signal
for
such
a
reception
as
only
a
parisian
audience
can
give
and
the
first
strains
that
issued
from
her
lips
assured
them
that
their
applause
was
not
misplaced
and
surely
never
was
the
dark
duchess
of
ferrara
more
faithfully
personated
than
by
the
present
artiste
this
vraisemblance
which
is
so
seldom
witnessed
in
the
opera
seemed
to
strike
every
eye
her
figure
was
tall
and
majestic
and
voluptuously
developed
her
air
and
bearing
were
haughty
dignified
and
her
complexion
was
very
dark
but
perfectly
clear
her
forehead
broad
and
high
her
brows
heavy
but
gracefully
arched
her
eyes
large
black
and
flashing
her
hair
dark
as
night
and
arranged
with
great
simplicity
in
glossy
bands
and
her
mouth
large
but
filled
with
teeth
of
whiteness
contrasted
by
lips
of
coral
wet
with
the
spray
the
entire
outline
of
her
face
was
roman
and
exhibited
in
its
contour
and
lineaments
even
more
than
roman
sternness
and
decision
and
its
effect
was
still
more
heightened
by
a
large
mole
at
one
corner
of
her
mouth
and
the
velvet
robes
in
which
she
was
appropriately
costumed
the
scene
between
the
duchess
and
the
spaniard
gubetta
was
received
with
the
utmost
applause
and
the
pathos
of
that
between
the
son
and
his
unknown
mother
which
succeeded
touched
the
audience
to
tears
but
when
the
maskers
rushed
in
and
her
vizard
was
torn
off
and
her
true
name
proclaimed
and
amid
her
wailings
the
curtain
fell
on
the
first
act
the
shouts
were
perfectly
thunderous
with
enthusiasm
the
rôle
of
gennaro
was
performed
by
the
brother
of
the
cantatrice
léon
a
young
man
of
twenty
of
delicate
and
graceful
figure
and
as
decidedly
blonde
as
his
sister
was
brunette
nature
seemed
to
have
made
a
great
mistake
in
sex
when
this
brother
and
sister
were
fashioned
indeed
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
they
could
be
brother
and
sister
a
remark
constantly
made
by
the
audience
and
the
kindred
announced
on
the
bills
was
generally
viewed
as
one
of
those
convenient
relationships
often
assumed
on
the
stage
but
having
no
more
reality
than
those
of
the
dramatis
personæ
themselves
a
second
pasta
cried
entering
the
stalls
immediately
on
the
descent
of
the
curtain
heard
you
ever
such
a
magnificent
contralto
saw
you
ever
such
a
magnificent
bust
asked
beauchamp
were
it
not
for
a
few
manifest
impossibilities
thoughtfully
remarked
debray
i
should
swear
that
this
same
angelic
louise
was
no
other
than
a
certain
very
beautiful
very
eccentric
and
very
talented
young
lady
whom
we
all
once
knew
as
a
star
of
parisian
fashion
and
who
the
last
time
she
was
in
this
house
sat
in
the
same
loge
where
now
sit
the
african
generals
whom
can
you
mean
debray
cried
beauchamp
a
certain
haughty
young
lady
who
was
to
have
married
an
italian
prince
but
on
the
night
of
the
bridal
in
the
midst
of
the
festivities
the
house
being
thronged
with
guests
and
even
while
the
contract
was
receiving
the
signatures
the
prince
was
arrested
as
an
escaped
and
at
his
trial
proved
to
be
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
bride
mother
and
a
certain
high
legal
functionary
the
procureur
du
roi
now
at
charenton
through
whose
burning
zeal
for
justice
the
horrible
discovery
transpired
ha
exclaimed
you
can
not
mean
eugénie
danglars
daughter
of
the
bankrupt
baron
whom
our
unhappy
friend
morcerf
was
once
to
have
wed
the
very
same
quietly
rejoined
the
secretary
but
this
lady
can
not
be
mlle
danglars
i
say
absolutely
for
many
sufficient
reasons
he
quickly
added
then
as
if
to
turn
the
conversation
he
hastily
remarked
ah
there
are
dantès
and
lamartine
as
usual
together
m
dantès
exclaimed
the
count
in
surprise
looking
around
impossible
and
yet
most
true
observed
beauchamp
in
the
third
loge
from
the
minister
to
the
right
what
a
wonderful
resemblance
there
is
between
those
men
the
poet
and
the
deputy
one
would
suppose
them
brothers
the
same
tall
and
elegant
figure
the
same
white
and
capacious
brow
the
same
dark
blazing
eye
the
same
raven
hair
and
above
all
the
same
most
unearthly
and
spiritual
pallor
of
complexion
no
wonder
dantès
is
pale
said
the
count
have
you
not
heard
of
the
occurrence
of
this
evening
in
the
chamber
dantès
was
in
the
midst
of
one
of
his
powerful
harangues
against
the
government
when
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
stopped
coughed
violently
several
times
and
pressed
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
then
taking
a
small
vial
from
his
vest
pocket
he
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
instantaneously
as
if
new
life
had
entered
him
proceeded
more
eloquently
than
ever
to
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
i
heard
something
of
this
said
beauchamp
as
he
descended
from
the
tribune
his
friends
thronged
around
him
anxious
about
his
health
he
quieted
their
apprehensions
with
his
peculiar
smile
of
assurance
but
i
observed
that
his
white
handkerchief
was
spotted
with
blood
and
he
almost
immediately
left
the
chamber
that
man
will
kill
himself
in
the
cause
he
has
espoused
remarked
debray
see
how
ghastly
he
now
looks
but
so
much
the
better
for
the
ministry
he
is
a
formidable
foe
indeed
that
loge
contains
the
two
most
powerful
opponents
of
the
government
and
who
are
those
men
just
entering
the
box
asked
beauchamp
none
other
than
the
two
rival
astronomers
of
europe
said
debray
and
yet
most
intimate
friends
the
taller
and
elder
the
one
with
gray
hair
a
dark
sharp
bedouin
countenance
and
that
large
wild
black
eye
with
a
smile
of
mingled
sarcasm
and
humor
ever
on
his
thin
lip
is
emanuel
arago
the
other
the
short
robust
man
with
fair
complexion
sandy
hair
bright
blue
eye
and
vivacious
expression
is
le
verrier
the
most
tireless
science
has
produced
since
galileo
but
hush
the
curtain
is
up
oh
it
matters
not
said
the
count
only
gennaro
and
the
spaniard
appear
in
the
second
act
and
i
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
save
for
the
duchess
but
who
are
those
beauchamp
where
in
the
loge
on
the
first
tier
next
to
the
minister
and
directly
opposite
to
that
of
m
dantès
ah
two
officers
of
the
spahis
and
two
most
exquisite
women
exclaimed
debray
they
belong
doubtless
to
the
african
party
in
the
loge
your
lorgnette
count
what
a
splendid
woman
hardly
had
the
secretary
raised
the
glass
to
his
eyes
before
he
dropped
it
with
the
exclamation
a
miracle
a
miracle
what
cried
both
of
the
other
young
men
turning
to
the
box
at
which
debray
was
gazing
messieurs
do
you
remember
the
fair
valentine
de
villefort
whose
untimely
and
mysterious
demise
all
the
young
people
of
paris
so
much
bewailed
some
two
or
three
years
ago
and
whose
lovely
remains
we
with
our
own
eyes
saw
deposited
in
the
and
de
villefort
vault
at
père
lachaise
one
bitter
cold
autumn
evening
and
there
listened
most
patiently
and
piously
to
a
whole
breviary
of
mournful
speeches
declarative
of
the
said
valentine
most
superlative
excellence
undoubtedly
we
remember
it
well
was
the
reply
then
behold
and
never
dare
to
doubt
the
reappearance
of
the
dead
again
to
the
ocular
organs
of
humanity
valentine
de
villefort
exclaimed
the
count
after
a
careful
and
scrutinizing
survey
by
all
that
supernatural
and
more
exquisitely
lovely
than
ever
then
it
was
true
after
all
the
strange
story
we
heard
said
beauchamp
of
the
young
lady
resurrection
and
marriage
to
maximilian
morrel
somewhere
far
away
in
parts
unknown
no
doubt
replied
the
count
for
if
i
mistake
not
and
i
sure
i
do
mistake
now
that
i
look
more
closely
that
stalwart
splendid
fellow
with
the
broad
forehead
black
eyes
and
moustache
and
the
order
of
the
legion
of
honor
on
his
breast
to
set
off
his
rich
uniform
of
the
spahis
and
on
whose
arm
the
fair
apparition
is
leaning
is
no
other
than
maximilian
morrel
himself
the
identical
man
who
saved
my
worthless
neck
from
a
yataghan
in
algeria
how
dark
he
grown
said
debray
no
more
so
than
all
these
african
heroes
for
instance
cavaignac
and
lamoricière
but
what
a
splendid
contrast
there
is
between
the
young
colonel
of
the
spahis
and
his
lovely
bride
if
such
she
be
he
dark
as
a
corsican
she
fair
as
an
englishwoman
he
upright
as
a
poplar
she
drooping
like
a
willow
his
hair
and
eyes
black
as
midnight
while
her
soft
languishing
orbs
are
as
blue
as
the
summer
sky
and
her
glossy
ringlets
as
brown
as
a
chestnut
on
my
word
said
beauchamp
the
count
grows
poetical
morrel
had
better
keep
his
beautiful
wife
out
of
the
way
but
have
you
discovered
who
are
the
other
couple
in
the
box
he
added
to
the
secretary
who
had
his
lorgnette
in
most
vigilant
requisition
any
more
discoveries
debray
a
sigh
might
have
been
heard
as
the
secretary
took
his
glass
from
his
eye
and
replied
simply
yes
and
who
now
asked
there
seems
no
end
to
discoveries
the
young
man
who
by
his
decorations
seems
a
chef
de
bataillon
of
the
spahis
replied
debray
i
can
not
make
out
but
be
he
whom
he
may
he
is
effectually
disguised
from
his
most
intimate
friends
by
his
luxuriant
beard
and
moustache
as
for
the
lady
there
is
but
one
woman
in
the
world
i
have
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
behold
who
could
be
mistaken
for
her
and
that
is
said
beauchamp
herself
and
who
is
herself
lucien
asked
have
you
forgotten
the
countess
de
morcerf
the
countess
de
morcerf
the
wife
of
the
general
who
was
convicted
by
the
peers
of
felony
treason
and
outrage
in
the
matter
of
ali
tebelen
pacha
of
yanina
said
beauchamp
and
who
blew
his
brains
out
in
despair
added
the
count
the
same
said
debray
she
returned
to
marseilles
with
her
son
albert
you
remember
albert
and
his
strange
conduct
in
the
duel
with
the
count
of
one
could
hardly
forget
such
chivalric
generosity
such
magnificent
magnanimity
and
such
sublime
as
were
exhibited
by
the
young
man
on
that
occasion
said
beauchamp
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
was
not
equally
forbearing
toward
the
arabs
in
his
african
campaigns
although
as
his
name
has
never
been
seen
or
heard
since
he
entered
the
army
in
all
probability
he
was
well
well
cried
the
secretary
impatiently
the
countess
retired
to
marseilles
and
there
she
is
said
to
have
resided
in
utter
seclusion
in
company
only
with
morrel
beautiful
wife
devoting
the
vast
wealth
of
the
deceased
count
to
philanthropic
objects
having
received
it
as
his
widow
only
with
the
understanding
it
should
be
thus
bestowed
but
the
rumor
was
said
beauchamp
and
indeed
i
was
so
assured
by
de
boville
himself
of
the
hospitals
at
the
time
that
the
countess
gave
all
the
count
fortune
to
the
hospitals
and
that
he
himself
registered
the
deed
of
gift
oh
that
was
only
some
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
thousand
francs
said
debray
three
months
after
her
settlement
at
marseilles
in
a
small
house
in
the
allées
de
meillan
said
to
be
her
own
by
maternal
inheritance
a
letter
came
to
her
from
thomson
and
french
of
rome
stating
that
there
was
a
deposit
in
their
house
to
the
credit
of
the
estate
of
the
late
count
of
the
enormous
sum
of
two
millions
of
francs
subject
to
her
sole
control
and
order
as
the
count
only
heir
in
the
absence
of
his
son
two
millions
of
francs
cried
the
two
young
men
in
a
breath
even
so
messieurs
said
debray
the
story
does
sound
rather
oriental
but
i
have
reason
to
know
that
it
is
entirely
true
for
i
made
diligent
inquiry
about
it
when
last
at
marseilles
and
what
took
you
to
marseilles
lucien
asked
the
count
significantly
the
ministry
replied
debray
with
evident
confusion
coloring
deeply
but
why
does
not
the
countess
marry
again
asked
surveying
her
faultless
form
and
face
through
his
glass
in
the
prime
of
life
rich
and
despite
her
past
troubles
most
exquisitely
beautiful
it
is
strange
she
do
make
herself
and
some
one
else
happy
especially
as
no
one
could
ever
accuse
her
of
having
very
desperately
loved
her
dear
first
husband
added
the
journalist
why
do
she
marry
lucien
how
the
devil
should
i
know
replied
the
secretary
in
great
confusion
you
do
suppose
i
ever
asked
her
the
question
do
you
upon
my
word
exclaimed
the
count
laughing
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
have
if
you
take
it
so
warmly
but
hist
the
bell
the
curtain
rises
we
must
lose
the
third
act
of
donizetti
chef
with
such
a
lucrezia
for
any
woman
living
but
it
was
very
evident
that
much
of
the
magnificent
performance
of
the
débutante
and
her
companion
in
the
thrilling
scene
between
the
duke
and
duchess
of
ferrara
and
the
young
captain
gennaro
was
lost
to
the
secretary
do
you
observe
beauchamp
how
strangely
fascinated
with
the
new
cantatrice
seems
the
young
officer
of
the
spahis
who
accompanies
the
countess
he
whispered
do
but
look
he
sits
like
one
transfixed
and
the
countess
seems
transfixed
also
though
not
by
the
same
object
was
the
reply
how
excessively
pale
yet
how
beautiful
she
is
that
plain
black
dress
without
ornament
or
jewel
and
her
raven
hair
parted
simply
on
her
forehead
enhance
her
voluptuous
charms
infinitely
more
than
could
the
most
gorgeous
costume
heavens
what
a
happy
man
will
he
be
who
can
call
her
his
amen
said
debray
and
the
word
seemed
to
rise
from
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
but
she
will
never
marry
some
early
disappointment
even
before
her
union
with
morcerf
has
withered
her
heart
and
the
terrible
divorce
which
parted
her
from
him
although
she
never
loved
him
will
keep
her
single
forever
her
first
and
only
love
is
either
dead
or
worse
married
to
another
see
see
lucien
cried
beauchamp
hurriedly
at
whom
does
she
gaze
so
intently
and
yet
so
sadly
it
can
not
be
lamartine
for
there
sits
his
lovely
young
english
wife
at
his
side
nor
can
it
be
old
arago
nor
young
le
verrier
and
yet
some
one
in
that
box
it
surely
is
m
dantès
cried
debray
impossible
that
man
seems
hardly
conscious
that
there
are
such
beings
as
women
his
whole
soul
is
in
affairs
of
state
his
whole
soul
seems
somewhere
else
just
at
present
exclaimed
the
secretary
bitterly
look
how
dreadfully
pale
he
is
said
beauchamp
and
yet
his
eyes
fairly
blaze
is
it
the
countess
he
gazes
at
is
it
dantès
she
gazes
at
at
that
moment
amid
the
wild
farewell
of
the
mother
to
her
son
upon
the
stage
the
curtain
came
down
and
at
the
same
instant
dantès
hastily
pressed
his
white
handkerchief
to
his
lips
and
leaning
on
the
arms
of
lamartine
and
arago
hastily
left
the
box
ha
the
countess
faints
cried
debray
as
the
door
closed
on
dantès
do
they
know
each
other
then
chapter
xiii
the
italian
lover
it
was
early
in
the
evening
succeeding
the
day
on
which
dantès
had
answered
giovanni
massetti
letter
zuleika
was
seated
in
the
vast
salon
of
the
magnificent
morcerf
mansion
now
as
the
reader
already
knows
the
residence
of
the
famous
and
mysterious
deputy
from
marseilles
she
sat
upon
a
superb
green
sofa
half
reclining
in
an
indolent
picturesque
attitude
behind
the
sofa
and
leaning
over
its
back
stood
a
young
italian
a
perfect
model
of
manly
beauty
his
ardent
black
eyes
were
riveted
on
zuleika
blushing
countenance
with
a
look
of
the
most
profound
and
enthusiastic
adoration
while
his
hand
held
the
young
girl
with
a
gentle
loving
pressure
which
was
returned
with
unmistakable
warmth
the
apartment
was
dimly
lighted
and
huge
sombre
patches
of
shadow
lay
everywhere
zuleika
and
her
lover
were
alone
together
for
some
time
they
seemed
too
full
of
happiness
to
speak
but
finally
giovanni
said
in
a
soft
flutelike
whisper
as
if
unwilling
to
break
with
loudly
uttered
words
the
delicious
spell
of
his
zuleika
darling
zuleika
so
you
did
not
once
forget
me
during
our
long
cruel
separation
never
for
a
single
instant
giovanni
answered
the
young
girl
the
flush
upon
her
cheek
deepening
as
she
spoke
her
hand
tightening
about
her
lover
and
her
lovely
eyes
filling
with
a
soft
fire
but
i
sometimes
feared
you
had
forgotten
me
you
were
always
present
in
my
mind
and
in
my
heart
replied
the
italian
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
her
through
and
through
stooping
he
placed
his
lips
to
her
forehead
and
imprinted
upon
it
a
long
and
silent
kiss
then
flushing
in
his
turn
he
added
still
holding
his
head
against
hers
from
the
very
moment
of
our
first
meeting
you
have
reigned
in
my
bosom
my
own
my
love
the
queen
of
my
destiny
and
my
life
oh
giovanni
giovanni
murmured
the
young
girl
i
am
happy
so
happy
he
kissed
her
again
this
time
upon
her
upturned
lips
that
with
a
slight
movement
almost
imperceptibly
returned
the
kiss
sending
his
blood
tingling
through
his
veins
and
causing
him
to
tremble
with
delight
from
head
to
foot
no
longer
able
to
restrain
himself
he
hastily
quitted
the
back
of
the
sofa
threw
himself
down
beside
her
and
clasping
her
in
his
arms
drew
her
unresistingly
upon
his
bosom
once
there
she
did
not
offer
to
stir
but
even
nestled
closer
to
him
and
pillowed
her
head
on
his
broad
shoulder
the
tumultuous
beating
of
both
their
hearts
was
audible
amid
the
unbroken
silence
that
ensued
with
one
hand
the
viscount
tenderly
smoothed
her
silken
tresses
and
his
arm
tightened
around
her
waist
as
if
he
had
determined
never
to
release
her
again
your
father
in
his
letter
of
this
morning
said
giovanni
finally
told
me
there
was
hope
that
you
did
not
look
upon
my
addresses
with
aversion
and
that
i
had
his
leave
to
pay
court
to
you
and
ascertain
your
wishes
from
your
own
dear
lips
i
hastened
here
this
evening
and
dantès
himself
bade
me
seek
you
in
this
salon
i
came
on
the
wings
of
love
and
found
all
my
fondest
hopes
realized
that
i
possessed
your
heart
as
you
possessed
mine
oh
tell
me
zuleika
that
this
is
not
all
a
dream
for
it
seems
too
delicious
to
be
true
it
is
reality
giovanni
blessed
reality
answered
the
young
girl
in
a
low
voice
and
do
you
really
love
me
with
all
your
soul
with
all
my
soul
giovanni
the
ardent
italian
showered
a
flood
of
burning
kisses
upon
her
forehead
cheeks
and
lips
and
she
quivered
like
a
leaf
in
his
embrace
then
he
said
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
his
tone
and
your
brother
espérance
is
he
disposed
to
look
upon
me
with
approval
you
know
that
in
rome
he
did
not
see
fit
to
include
me
in
the
number
of
his
friends
we
had
a
little
difference
you
will
remember
and
ever
afterwards
he
was
cold
toward
me
zuleika
shuddered
as
she
recalled
the
fact
that
the
little
difference
alluded
to
had
been
a
violent
quarrel
that
had
nearly
resulted
in
a
duel
between
the
two
young
men
she
had
never
known
the
details
for
both
her
brother
and
giovanni
had
studiously
concealed
them
from
her
indeed
espérance
had
carefully
avoided
all
mention
of
the
viscount
name
ever
since
the
day
they
had
become
embroiled
was
dantès
aware
of
the
trouble
between
his
son
and
the
youthful
italian
she
did
not
know
but
at
the
same
time
felt
firmly
persuaded
that
her
father
had
fully
investigated
the
doings
character
and
family
of
her
suitor
and
would
not
have
sanctioned
a
renewal
of
his
addresses
to
her
had
he
not
been
perfectly
satisfied
in
every
respect
she
therefore
answered
i
am
altogether
ignorant
as
to
what
espérance
thinks
of
you
and
can
not
say
whether
he
still
harbors
resentment
against
you
or
not
but
whatever
may
be
his
opinion
and
feelings
rest
assured
that
he
will
never
interfere
to
cause
his
sister
an
instant
of
unhappiness
more
especially
as
he
knows
that
my
father
looks
upon
you
with
a
favoring
eye
but
how
about
the
coldness
existing
between
us
does
it
still
exist
on
both
sides
not
on
mine
zuleika
not
on
mine
i
forgave
and
forgot
all
long
ago
forgave
and
forgot
then
espérance
must
have
wronged
you
he
did
zuleika
and
with
the
proverbial
hot
blood
and
headlong
impulses
of
the
roman
youth
i
resented
that
wrong
but
i
could
not
remain
at
enmity
with
the
brother
of
the
girl
i
loved
so
when
i
became
cooler
i
sought
him
out
and
endeavored
to
apologize
and
he
accepted
your
apology
he
did
not
accept
it
but
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
me
without
a
word
he
evidently
thought
me
a
coward
and
attributed
my
efforts
toward
effecting
a
reconciliation
to
a
desire
to
escape
fighting
him
but
why
did
you
quarrel
in
the
first
place
what
was
the
cause
of
the
difference
between
you
the
young
italian
hung
his
head
and
did
not
answer
zuleika
saw
that
he
had
grown
deadly
pale
and
she
felt
his
hand
tremble
nervously
freeing
herself
from
his
embrace
the
young
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
giovanni
said
she
firmly
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
this
painful
affair
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
know
it
do
you
doubt
me
zuleika
do
you
doubt
me
he
asked
bitterly
and
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
do
i
doubt
you
giovanni
no
but
if
you
love
me
tell
me
all
the
details
of
the
trouble
between
my
brother
and
yourself
i
can
not
i
can
not
zuleika
he
cried
command
me
to
shed
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
for
you
and
i
will
do
it
without
an
hesitation
but
i
can
not
tell
you
that
terrible
tale
of
deceit
treachery
and
bloodshed
he
had
arisen
and
was
walking
excitedly
about
the
salon
his
pallor
had
increased
and
he
trembled
in
every
limb
zuleika
stood
with
folded
arms
and
gazed
at
him
she
was
calm
and
her
eyes
had
a
look
of
determination
the
young
man
had
never
before
beheld
in
them
it
filled
him
with
dismay
a
few
moments
ago
she
had
been
all
love
and
tenderness
a
yielding
trusting
maiden
in
her
lover
arms
now
she
resembled
a
beautiful
amazon
bent
on
achieving
a
victory
whom
nothing
but
unconditional
surrender
would
satisfy
the
story
the
story
she
repeated
tell
me
the
story
her
face
was
as
white
as
marble
and
her
faultless
lips
seemed
chiseled
from
stone
she
looked
so
beautiful
and
tempting
as
she
stood
there
her
surpassing
loveliness
enhanced
by
the
picturesque
dress
she
wore
that
the
viscount
felt
his
passion
for
her
redoubled
he
flung
himself
at
her
feet
and
seizing
the
hem
of
her
superb
robe
kissed
it
rapturously
oh
zuleika
zuleika
he
cried
utterly
unable
to
restrain
himself
i
am
your
slave
place
your
tiny
foot
upon
my
neck
and
crush
me
where
i
lie
i
shall
expire
adoring
you
giovanni
replied
zuleika
greatly
moved
by
this
display
of
devotion
rise
and
be
a
man
the
italian
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
then
he
endeavored
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
but
she
quietly
repulsed
him
zuleika
cried
he
sadly
you
do
not
love
me
you
never
loved
me
i
have
been
the
victim
of
a
cruel
deception
if
you
think
so
answered
the
young
girl
quietly
there
is
but
one
course
you
can
pursue
as
a
man
of
honor
spurn
the
deceiver
from
you
and
never
look
upon
her
face
again
the
young
man
gazed
at
her
reproachfully
what
have
i
done
to
turn
you
thus
against
me
he
asked
his
tone
suddenly
becoming
humble
what
have
you
done
you
refuse
to
reveal
this
mystery
to
me
which
as
you
yourself
admit
involves
deceit
treachery
and
bloodshed
and
which
for
aught
i
know
has
set
an
indelible
stain
upon
your
life
i
love
you
truly
love
you
with
all
the
passion
of
a
woman
nature
but
i
must
know
this
history
that
i
may
judge
whether
you
are
worthy
of
my
love
i
assure
you
zuleika
that
there
is
no
stain
upon
my
life
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
history
that
tends
in
the
least
to
dishonor
me
but
still
i
can
not
speak
then
we
must
separate
oh
zuleika
zuleika
do
not
be
pitiless
you
will
drive
me
mad
the
young
girl
touched
a
bell
and
ali
the
nubian
appeared
monsieur
is
about
taking
his
departure
said
she
to
the
faithful
servant
i
leave
him
in
your
hands
and
without
a
word
of
farewell
to
giovanni
she
swept
from
the
salon
like
a
queen
the
viscount
gazed
after
her
with
indescribable
sadness
pictured
upon
his
handsome
countenance
then
he
followed
ali
put
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
and
regretfully
left
the
house
chapter

the

even
to
the
communists
with
whom
he
had
come
into
such
close
contact
dantès
the
deputy
from
marseilles
remained
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
ever
marrast
though
now
devotedly
attached
to
him
admitted
that
he
was
totally
unable
to
fathom
either
his
designs
or
his
methods
of
accomplishing
them
while
lamartine
who
was
in
his
company
a
large
portion
of
the
time
when
questioned
concerning
him
replied
that
all
he
knew
of
dantès
was
that
he
was
a
firm
friend
of
the
cause
and
an
untiring
worker
in
the
interest
of
the
weary
and
oppressed
masses
debray
though
he
had
no
tangible
foundation
for
it
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
the
dangerous
deputy
and
the
count
of
were
one
and
the
same
individual
but
beauchamp
with
the
usual
incredulity
of
journalists
scoffed
at
the
notion
and
derided
it
whenever
it
was
mentioned
in
his
presence
that
dantès
had
great
wealth
was
however
generally
admitted
though
whence
it
was
derived
or
in
what
manner
it
was
invested
no
one
could
tell
it
was
now
no
longer
a
secret
that
he
had
purchased
and
resided
in
the
magnificent
mansion
formerly
owned
by
the
count
de
morcerf
in
the
rue
du
helder
and
this
circumstance
while
it
vastly
augmented
the
interest
attaching
to
him
did
not
in
the
least
detract
from
the
enthusiasm
felt
for
him
by
the
working
classes
it
was
night
in
a
large
chamber
richly
furnished
but
dimly
lighted
in
the
mansion
in
the
rue
du
helder
the
same
apartment
once
inhabited
by
the
countess
de
morcerf
motionless
and
seemingly
lifeless
with
a
countenance
as
pale
as
alabaster
and
as
still
lay
dantès
the
deputy
from
marseilles
although
in
the
ashy
pallor
of
the
lips
and
brow
and
the
fixed
serene
almost
stern
aspect
of
the
immovable
face
might
be
read
unmistakable
evidence
of
an
exhausting
and
dangerous
constitutional
shock
to
the
system
yet
none
of
that
emaciation
over
which
broods
the
shadow
of
the
angel
of
death
resulting
from
protracted
illness
was
there
to
be
seen
the
broad
white
forehead
the
raven
hair
sparsely
sprinkled
with
silver
the
round
temples
the
delicately
penciled
brow
encircling
like
a
sable
arch
the
large
and
eye
the
full
calm
lip
and
the
chiseled
chin
and
nostril
all
these
were
as
perfect
now
as
when
last
before
the
reader
the
cheek
was
perhaps
slightly
sunken
but
it
could
not
be
more
pallid
than
when
last
beheld
and
but
for
that
nameless
quietude
that
rapture
of
repose
as
lord
byron
well
expresses
it
that
placid
languor
which
sleeps
on
the
features
which
illness
always
creates
and
which
spiritualizes
and
intellectualizes
the
most
common
features
the
invalid
might
be
supposed
to
be
enjoying
the
most
quiet
slumber
excepting
the
invalid
there
was
no
one
in
that
chamber
save
the
faithful
ali
who
moved
noiselessly
about
from
time
to
time
or
sat
immovably
upon
the
floor
and
gazed
on
his
master
pallid
face
as
the
silvery
tones
of
the
chamber
clock
tinkled
forth
the
third
quarter
after
ten
the
door
opened
and
a
small
dark
thin
man
with
large
whiskers
keen
penetrating
eyes
broad
bald
forehead
thinly
covered
with
gray
hair
and
apparently
about
fifty
years
of
age
briskly
entered
it

orfila
a
name
somewhat
known
in
medical
science
approaching
the
bed
he
placed
his
fingers
upon
the
sick
man
pulse
and
gazed
earnestly
on
his
face
for
some
time
in
silence
strange
he
at
length
muttered
the
most
powerful
drugs
in
the
most
quantities
are
powerless
who
then
is
this
man
whose
nature
so
differs
from
that
of
every
one
else
can
he
so
have
accustomed
his
system
to
poisons
that
as
with
the
king
of
pontus
they
are
ineffectual
to
help
or
to
harm
him
his
constitution
must
be
iron
the
vitality
of
a
dozen
men
is
in
him
or
he
have
been
dead
a
month
ago
well
it
plain
he
no
worse
if
he
no
better
drugs
are
useless
and
he
must
be
left
to
nature
and
his
amazing
constitution
this
stupor
this
utter
death
of
all
the
faculties
and
senses
for
so
long
a
time
is
wonderful
fever
delirium
anything
but
this
trance
it
seems
as
if
this
man
had
been
sleepless
all
his
life
before
and
that
now
his
overwrought
brain
and
heart
were
compensating
themselves
for
the
toil
and
wakefulness
of
years
could
i
but
excite
the
nerves
for
some
time
the
physician
gazed
in
deep
thought
at
the
pale
face
of
the
unconscious
slumberer
suddenly
turning
to
the
nubian
he
said
to
him
ali
where
does
your
master
keep
the
drugs
he
has
been
for
years
accustomed
to
take
the
nubian
stared
in
mute
amazement
but
moved
not
from
his
rug
ali
said
orfila
sternly
unless
i
see
and
know
those
drugs
this
night
your
master
dies
the
nubian
looked
anxiously
into
the
face
of
the
physician
and
then
as
if
satisfied
with
the
scrutiny
rose
and
with
noiseless
steps
left
the
room
in
a
few
moments
he
and
placed
in
the
hands
a
small
casket
of
ebony
exquisitely
worked
and
studded
with
gems
taking
it
hastily
to
the
shaded
lamp
upon
a
table
at
the
extremity
of
the
chamber
he
attempted
to
open
it
but
his
attempts
were
vain
indeed
to
all
appearances
it
was
a
solid
block
of
ebony
and
its
extreme
heaviness
compared
with
its
dimensions
seemed
to
favor
the
idea
well
said
the
doctor
returning
the
casket
after
a
close
scrutiny
to
the
nubian
who
had
followed
him
ali
took
the
casket
and
instantly
a
portion
of
the
top
flew
up
disclosing
within
the
centre
of
the
cube
of
ebony
a
cavity
lined
with
crimson
velvet
and
a
dazzling
array
of
minute
vials
of
crystal
each
filled
with
a
fluid
pink
blue
green
and
yellow
in
hue
while
the
contents
of
several
were
colorless
the
nubian
had
touched
a
spring
concealed
in
the
carving
and
known
only
to
his
master
and
himself
the
physician
removed
the
minute
vials
one
after
another
from
their
receptacles
and
held
them
up
to
the
light
on
each
was
a
cipher
and
on
no
two
was
the
same
most
of
them
were
quite
filled
with
the
fluid
contained
but
some
were
only
half
full
while
one
was
nearly
empty
orfila
looked
closely
at
the
cipher
upon
each
vial
as
he
removed
it
from
the
casket
he
then
held
it
to
the
light
to
determine
its
particular
hue
or
shade
and
sometimes
withdrew
the
crystal
stopper
ground
into
the
deep
mouth
touching
it
cautiously
and
quickly
to
his
nostril

the
tip
of
his

thought
as

exclaimed
he
holding
up
the

which
showed
by
being
nearly
empty
that
its
contents
had
been
used
more
frequently
than
those
of
any
of
the
others
how
many

of
this
is
the
greatest
number
your

has
ever
taken
asked
orfila
the

who
it
will
be
remembered
was

up
both
hands
with
the
fingers
outspread
and
then
two
other
fingers
of
one
of
his
hands

cried
the
astonished
physician
impossible
ali
insisted
on
the
assertion
and
yet
it
must
be
so
the
doctor
added
that
would
explain
all
taking
the
vial
and
a
minute
crystal
vessel
which
he
found
in
the
casket
he
hastily
but
carefully
dropped
into
the
latter
thirteen
drops
then
filling
the
vessel
with
water
he
approached
the
patient
who
still
slumbered
heavily
on
and
placed
it
to
his
lips
for
an
instant
he
seemed
conscious
of
the
wish
of
the
physician
and
with
an
effort
the
mixture
was
swallowed
then
he
lay
as
still
and
motionless
as
before
returning
the
vials
and
the
vessel
to
their
places
orfila
closed
the
casket
and
gave
it
to
the
nubian
he
then
gazed
long
and
anxiously
at
the
torpid
slumberer
standing
at
the
bedside
and
watching
that
marble
face
at
length
the
clock
struck
eleven
orfila
started
and
hastily
glanced
at
his
repeater
then
turning
to
the
nubian
who
had
carried
away
the
casket
and
having
noiselessly
returned
stood
silently
beside
him
he
said
ali
in
one
hour
your
master
will
be
in
high
fever
in
two
hours
he
will
probably
be
delirious
he
will
then
sleep
soundly
and
toward
morning
will
wake
i
hope
in
his
right
mind
but
terribly
exhausted
and
profusely
perspiring
at
daylight
i
shall
be
here
you
must
not
leave
him
for
a
single
instant
as
you
value
his
life
the
nubian
clasped
his
hands
above
his
head
and
bent
his
forehead
almost
to
the
floor
if
you
think
necessary
however
ali
send
for
me
before
morning
the
physician
gave
one
more
look
at
his
patient
pressed
his
fingers
on
his
pulse
placed
his
palm
on
his
forehead
and
then
taking
his
hat
and
cane
left

chapter

the
unknown
nurse
when
the
rumor
that
dantès
had
been
taken
seriously
ill
was
first
circulated
throughout
paris
it
caused
excitement
in
every
quarter
of
the
city
filling
the
communists
and
workmen
with
dismay
and
greatly
elating
their
opponents
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
a
strange
lady
very
plainly
attired
but
whose
language
and
bearing
gave
unmistakable
evidence
of
refinement
and
aristocratic
associations
made
her
appearance
one
morning
at
the
office
of
orfila
and
humbly
asked
permission
to
nurse
his
distinguished
patient
the
physician
somewhat
surprised
at
such
a
request
from
such
a
woman
immediately
grew
suspicious
and
demanded
an
explanation
when
the
lady
informed
him
that
she
had
known
the
sick
man
in
his
youth
and
was
still
deeply
interested
in
his
welfare
she
refused
to
give
her
name
but
solemnly
assured
the
doctor
that
should
he
grant
her
petition
dantès
on
his
recovery
would
be
ready
to
thank
him
on
bended
knees
convinced
at
length
that
no
harm
was
intended
the
physician
gave
his
permission
and
the
unknown
lady
was
duly
installed
as
nurse
she
discharged
her
duties
with
unflagging
devotion
and
energy
satisfying
even
the
exacting

whom
she

was
still
there
how
strange
the
bond

connects

the
body
with

more
strange
is
that
phase
of
existence
in
which
the
one
moves
on
without
the
other
the
mind
sometimes
is
all
life
when
the
body
is
dead
and
oftener
still
is
the
body
all
life
when
the
mind
seems
gone
mind
too
may
frequently
act
independently
not
only
of
the
body
as
in
dreams
but
also
of
consciousness
and
of
the
heart
while
the
body
as
in
somnambulism
may
act
altogether
alone
on
on
the
slumberer
breathed
on
but
he
thought
not
felt
not
perceived
not
a
revolution
an
earthquake
might
heave
around
him
but
the
convulsive
throes
of
man
or
of
nature
would
have
been
as
nothing
to
him
the
brow
would
have
remained
as
calm
and
as
cold
and
the
cheek
as
pale
and
as
still
while
in
all
human
probability
the
faithful
nubian
would
have
sat
as
immovable
upon
his
rug
at
the
bedside
of
his
beloved
master
and
have
gazed
upon
him
as
untiringly
with
his
dark
and
sleepless
eye
as
the
last
quarter
after
eleven
sounded
followed
immediately
by
the
hour
of
midnight
a
small
door
beside
the
bed
noiselessly
opened
and
a
female
figure
in
white
silently
entered
the
room
but
not
so
noiselessly
was
the
entrance
effected
as
to
escape
the
ear
of
the
vigilant
ali
he
glanced
hurriedly
around
then
as
if
familiar
with
the
apparition
and
anticipating
its
approach
he
rose
and
taking
his
rug
to
the
further
extremity
of
the
chamber
again
laid
himself
down
like
a
faithful
dog
though
not
now
to
watch
meanwhile
the
lady
quietly
approaching
the
bed
gazed
long
and
mournfully
at
the
slumberer
pale
yet
noble
visage
then
kneeling
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
amid
the
coverings
she
was
probably
forty
yet
in
the
full
and
faultless
perfection
of
her
form
in
her
graceful
and
yielding
motions
in
her
statuesque
bust
rounded
cheek
and
hair
she
would
to
the
casual
observer
have
indicated
hardly
the
half
of
that
age
her
figure
was
tall
and
dignified
yet
mobile
as
a
willow
her
eyes
were
dark
and
luminous
and
in
their
profound
depths
slept
a
world
of
melancholy
meaning
her
hair
was
simply
parted
on
a
broad
forehead
and
was
gathered
in
heavy
masses
low
on
the
neck
her
lips
were
full
and
red
and
when
parted
exhibited
teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
while
her
complexion
which
was
very
dark
was
yet
clear
and
pure
as
the
hue
of
the
magnolia
petal
but
that
face
was
pale
very
pale
almost
as
colorless
as
that
of
the
quiet
sleeper
at
its
side
and
upon
it
rested
an
expression
of
love
unutterable
mingled
with
the
sadness
of
death
such
was
the
unknown
nurse
the
countess
de
morcerf
as
she
again
was
an
inmate
of
that
apartment
of
which
she
had
once
under
circumstances
how
different
been
mistress
such
was
mercédès
the
catalane
of
marseilles
again
at
the
side
of
the
man
whom
all
her
life
she
had
loved
with
none
to
gainsay
or
forbid
upon
that
pale
and
motionless
countenance
she
gazed
long
and
deeply
and
oh
the
world
of
memory
that
passed
through
her
mind
the
world
of
thought
and
feeling
that
centred
in
that
fixed
gaze
at
length
clasping
her
hands
upon
her
forehead
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
she
bowed
her
face
upon
the
bed
from
which
she
had
just
raised
it
and
long
seemed
absorbed
in
prayer
roused
from
this
position
by
some
movement
of
the
slumberer
she
started
up
and
watched
him
the
shaded
rays
of
the
dim
and
distant
lamp
threw
a
faint
glimmering
of
light
upon
the
pale
countenance
but
the
quick
eye
of
love
instantaneously
detected
a
change
a
slight
flush
was
mounting
the
cheek
and
gentle
perspiration
was
distilling
upon
the
brow
while
a
smile
played
on
the
mouth
suddenly
as
she
gazed
those
pallid
lips
moved
astonished
she
listened
marseilles
beautiful
marseilles
said
the
sleeper
home
of
my
boyhood
home
of
my
heart
i
come
then
quickly
and
sternly
came
the
order
let
go
the
anchor
furl
the
sails
mate
take
charge
of
the
ship
then
the
tones
changed
and
a
joyful
light
shot
over
the
face
as
the
lips
exclaimed
now
for
my
father
now
for
my
love
mercédès
mercédès
amazed
the
fair
watcher
retained
her
position
and
gazed
and
listened
so
silently
and
breathlessly
that
the
quick
and
audible
beatings
of
her
heart
might
have
been
numbered
mine
mine
at
last
continued
the
dreamer
the
the
but
instantly
the
expression
of
the
voice
and
the
countenance
altered
the
light
of
joy
was
shrouded
in
clouds
arrest
arrest

was
the
exclamation
me
at
my
a
dungeon
for
me

my
love
my
wife
oh
god
it
is
the

despair
despair
shocked
terrified
at
the
terrible
energy
of
these
words
and
the
expression
of
unutterable
woe
that
rested
on
the
countenance
of
the
sleeper
the
affrighted
woman
who
comprehended
but
too
well
the
fearful
significance
of
the
abrupt
and
disjointed
syllables
hastily
arose
as
if
to
rouse
the
slumberer
from
his
dream
or
to
call
on
the
nubian
for
aid
but
before
she
could
carry
the
purpose
into
execution
the
aspect
of
the
deputy
visage
again
had
changed
a
dark
frown
settled
on
the
brow
a
spirit
of
fixed
resolve
contracted
the
firm
lip
and
dilated
the
nostril
and
the
word
vengeance
vengeance
in
whispers
scarcely
audible
but
repeatedly
and
rapidly
pronounced
was
heard
a
longer
silence
than
before
succeeded
at
length
another
change
swept
over
the
face
and
the
words
free
free
i
am
free
burst
from
the
lips
then
they
murmured
treasure
untold
wondrous
wealth
diamonds
pearls
rubies
ingots
of

the
mad
abbé
dream
was
reality
again
the
countenance
darkened
fourteen
years
in
a
dungeon
for
no
crime
a
father
dead
of
starvation
a
bride
the
bride
of
the
fiend
who
has
done
all
this
and
he
a

and
his
friends
a
millionaire
of
paris
and
the
procureur
du
roi
vengeance
vengeance
vengeance
there
was
a
pause
and
the
dreamer
exultingly
continued
it
is
done
the
peer
of
france
is
a
disgraced
suicide
the
procureur
du
roi
is
a
madman
the
banker
is
a
bankrupt
the
dreamer
again
paused
and
his
countenance
once
more
changed
alas
alas

not

mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
the
innocent

with
the

has
been
the
recompense

henceforth
the
aim
to
that

wealth
untold
the
lips
ceased
to
move
gradually
the
high
excitement
of
the
features
passed
away
and
was
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
sadness
and
love

the
dreamer
spoke
he
spread
wide
his
arms
when
his
eyes
opened
and
his
long
slumbering
senses
returned
mercédès
his
own
mercédès
was
indeed
clasped
to
his
breast

he
faintly
whispered
ah
it
was
no

for
you
are
indeed

was
the
reply
and
she
clasped

feeble
form

a
notable
fête
on
the
night
of
monday
february
all
paris
was
at
the
house
of
gaultier
de
rumilly
in
the
avenue
des
champs
elysées
gaultier
de
rumilly
was
well
known
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
extreme
left
though
the
confidential
friend
of
odillon
barrot
and
the
fête
was
perfectly
understood
to
be
a
political
reunion
rather
than
a
social
one
all
the
accompaniments
of
the
most
splendid
society
events
of
the
season
were
in
requisition
even
the
brilliant
balls
given
by
the
opulent
citizens
of
new
york
were
eclipsed
in
luxury
and
splendor
there
was
the
streaming
of
lamps
and
chandeliers
the
swell
of
enchanting
music
the
whirl
of
the
fascinating
polka
redowa
or
mazurka
while
throngs
of
richly
attired
and
lovely
women
were
constantly
enhancing
the
magnificence
of
the
scene
by
their
arrival
the
brilliancy
of
the
occasion
was
also
richly
diversified
by
the
presence
of
an
unusually
large
number
of
officers
of
the
municipal
and
national
guards
in
full
uniform
as
well
as
of
several
belonging
to
the
line
or
the
regiments
of
algeria
it
was
about
ten
within
all
was
light
life
and
loveliness
without
the
winter
wind
moaned
drearily
through
the
leafless
trees
of
the
boulevard
and
the
drifting
sleet
swept
along
the
deserted
streets
it
was
a
wild
night
throughout
all
paris
seemed
going
forth
a
portentous
murmur
like
that
mysterious
moaning
of
the
ocean
which
with
mariners
is
the
prelude
of
a
storm
an
ominous
whispering
as
of
many
voices
seemed
to
sink
and
swell
on
the
sweeping
night
blast
then
all
was
still
again
in
the
distance
would
rise
a
sharp
shout
or
the
stern
brief
word
of
military
command
at
intervals
also
one
might
imagine
he
heard
a
deep
rumbling
as
of
heavy
ordnance
and
its
tumbrels
over
the
pavements
accompanied
by
the
measured
tread
of
armed
men
and
the
clattering
hoofs
of
cavalry
horses
then
these
sounds
died
away
and
along
the
narrow
streets
of
paris
again
the
night
wind
only
swept
the
bitter
blast
howled
and
the
ominous
whispering
as
of
spirits
rose
and
fell
it
was
a
strange
and
stormy
night
murky
and
chilly
while
at
intervals
the
cold
rain
dashed
down
in
cutting
blasts
but
within
the
magnificent
mansion
of
gaultier
de
rumilly
all
was
light
and
loveliness
as
has
been
said
the
splendid
salons
were
already
thronged
yet
crowds
of
guests
were
constantly
arriving
ha
beauchamp
just
come
cried
to
his
friend
as
he
entered
by
the
grace
of
god
yes
said
the
journalist
what
a
night
what
a
throng
of
men
and
women
say
rather
was
the
reply
very
true
who
here
ask
who
not
here
and
your
question
may
be
easily
answered
all
paris
is
here
women
of
every
age
and
station
and
men
of
all
political
creeds
conservatives
dynastics
legitimists
republicans
and
communists
indeed
this
soirée
seems
to
me
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
were
designed
so
to
be
a
general
reunion
of
the
leaders
of
all
the
great
parties
in
france
to
compare
notes
and
learn
the
news
and
there
is
news
enough
to
learn
it
would
seem
is
dantès
here
he
is
or
was
and
his
beautiful
wife
too
the
most
magnificent
woman
in
paris
morrel
also
is
here
with
his
fair
bride
and
who
is
that
dark
dignified
man
in
the
turkish
costume
around
whom
the
ladies
have
clustered
so
inquisitively
asked
the
deputy
why
that
the
emir
of
algeria
the
famous
captive
of
the
duke
was
the
reply
what
how
comes
he
here
oh
as
a
special
favor
i
suppose
he
has
a
respite
from
his
sad
prison
what
a
splendid
beard
and
what
keen
black
eyes
no
his
eyes
are
decidedly
gray
but
so
shaded
by
his
extraordinary
lashes
that
they
seem
black
they
say
that
he
was
more
distinguished
as
a
scholar
in
algeria
than
as
a
soldier
statesman
or
priest
in
fact
he
is
as
erudite
as
an
arab
can
be
and
his
library
which
is
contained
in
two
leathern
trunks
accompanied
him
in
all
his
wanderings
prior
to
his
submission
and
what
think
you
really
induced
him
to
surrender
himself
policy
of
the
deepest
character
and
worthy
of
talleyrand
metternich
or
nesselrode
if
we
are
to
rely
on
the
eloquent
speech
of
lamoricière
in
the
chamber
the
other
day
i
remember
bugeaud
spoke
first
and
lamoricière
followed
he
thought
that
the
arab
curtius
leaped
into
the
gulf
because
by
so
doing
he
was
convinced
he
could
injure
french
interests
more
than
by
his
freedom
well
perhaps
he
was
right
he
bids
fair
to
be
a
hard
bone
of
contention
between
the
opposition
and
the
ministry
if
i
mistake
not
lamoricière
disclaimed
all
responsibility
for
accepting
the
surrender
and
placed
it
on
the
the
young
duke
for
whom
the
ministry
is
liable
yes
and
guizot
announced
that
he
would
send
the
emir
back
to
alexandria
could
security
be
given
against
his
return
to
algeria
as
to
the
emir
surrender
at
which
you
wonder
the
real
cause
is
said
to
have
been
not
policy
but
the
universal
passion
love
he
is
an
antony
then
instead
of
a
curtius
so
it
seems
at
the
moment
when
with
incredible
efforts
he
had
effected
the
passage
of
the
moorish
camp
and
was
off
like
an
ostrich
for
the
desert
the
firing
of
the
french
who
had
reached
his
deira
struck
his
ear
back
he
flew
like
the
lamiel
twice
his
horse
fell
under
him
dead
twice
he
was
surrounded
and
seized
and
twice
by
his
wonderful
agility
he
regained
his
freedom
at
last
perceiving
that
all
was
lost
he
turned
his
face
again
toward
the
desert
and
for
two
days
and
nights
continued
his
flight
but
his
heart
was
behind
him
certain
of
escape
himself
he
preferred
hopeless
captivity
with
her
he
loved
and
he
returned
quite
poetical
on
my
word
worthy
of
sadi
the
arab
petrarch
himself
said
he
is
decidedly
a
great
man
that
they
say
he
bears
his
misfortunes
like
a
philosopher
or
better
a
turk
unalterably
mild
and
dignified
while
his
wives
and
his
mother
wail
at
his
feet
every
morning
he
reads
the
koran
to
them
and
during
the
orisons
all
the
windows
are
open
and
a
large
fire
blazes
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
is
a
decided
godsend
to
the
quidnuncs
of
paris
so
would
be
a
hottentot
or
a
north
american
savage
replied
beauchamp
rather
a
different
affair
this
from
the
ministerial
soirée
a
week
ago
i
fancy
remarked
the
editor
rather
i
will
confess
to
you
beauchamp
i
attended
that
soirée
from
curiosity
to
see
whether
guizot
retained
his
habitual
placidity
of
manner
amid
the
clouds
every
day
thickening
around
him
and
what
was
the
result
why
this
he
was
as
polite
and
courteous
as
ever
and
the
same
cold
imperturbable
smile
was
on
his
thin
lip
but
he
looked
careworn
and
upon
his
countenance
was
an
expression
of
solicitude
when
it
was
closely
watched
which
i
never
saw
there
before
ah
beauchamp
i
envy
not
the
premier
and
the
guests
asked
the
journalist
of
guests
there
were
but
few
and
the
spacious
salons
of
the
hôtel
des
affaires
étrangères
looked
dismal
and
deserted
the
lovely
countess
leven
even
she
was
absent
and
the
countess
of
dino
absent
too
the
soirée
must
have
been
indeed
dull
without
those
queens
of
intrigue
as
louis
blanc
courteously
calls
them
but
tell
me
count
is
the
minister
really
the
husband
of
the
beautiful
leven
or
is
she
only
his
par
amours
no
one
knows
it
is
certain
however
that
the
great
man
devotes
to
the
enchantress
every
moment
he
can
steal
from
the
state
though
to
look
at
him
one
would
hardly
suppose
him
a
lover
in
any
meaning
of
the
term
but
who
knows
to
read
his
writings
can
one
imagine
a
purer
man
but
then
the
affairs
of
gisquet
cubières
teste
and
last
and
worst
petit
whose
case
was
before
the
chamber
do
they
not
betray
deplorable
lack
of
firmness
or
morality
but
no
more
of
this
who
is
that
dark
splendid
woman
to
whom
young
joliette
seems
so
devoted
i
have
seen
them
together
before
why
you
surely
have
not
forgotten
louise
the
charming
cantatrice
she
has
recently
left
the
boards
to
the
irreparable
loss
of
the
opera
having
come
into
possession
of
an
immense
inheritance
some
millions
it
is
said
left
by
her
father
who
was
once
a
banker
of
paris
she
is
asserted
to
be
very
accomplished
and
very
ambitious
and
as
the
young
african
paladin
is
thoroughly
bewitched
by
her
and
she
by
him
they
will
doubtless
be
matched
as
well
as
paired
has
lucien
been
here
asked
the
deputy
after
a
pause
during
which
the
young
men
surveyed
the
brilliant
throngs
that
passed
before
them
and
returned
the
salutations
of
their
acquaintances
i
think
not
we
have
not
met
at
least
replied
the
journalist
he
can
hardly
be
spared
i
fancy
the
ministry
have
had
a
stormy
day
and
are
doubtless
preparing
for
one
still
more
stormy
there
was
a
perfect
tempest
in
the
chamber
this
evening
i
understand
call
it
rather
a
hurricane
a
tornado
ah
give
me
the
particulars
here
come
with
me
into
this
corner
unfortunately
i
was
not
present
i
was
busy
on
the
general
committee
for
the
banquet
of
the
twelfth
arrondissement
at
chaillot
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
collision
with
the
police
we
resolved
you
know
not
to
have
the
banquet
within
the
walls
of
paris
and
so
there
is
to
be
a
procession
to
the
barrière
de
i
have
been
there
since
morning
and
reached
the
city
only
in
time
to
come
here
so
you
see
i
am
edifyingly
ignorant
of
the
latest
news
then
i
have
to
inform
you
that
there
is
to
be
no
banquet
after
all
no
banquet
why
i
thought
it
was
compromised
between
guizot
and
barrot
that
the
banquet
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
under
protest
in
order
that
the
question
might
be
brought
before
the
supreme
court
such
was
the
purpose
but
a
manifesto
of
the
banquet
committee
drawn
up
by
marrast
it
is
said
and
at
all
events
issued
in
this
morning
declaring
the
design
not
only
of
a
banquet
but
of
a
procession
changed
everything
the
address
sets
forth
that
all
invited
to
the
banquet
would
assemble
at
the
place
de
la
madeleine
at
about
noon
and
thence
escorted
by
the
national
guard
and
accompanied
by
the
students
of
the
universities
should
proceed
by
the
place
de
la
concorde
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
at
the
extremity
of
the
avenue
des
champs
elysées
and
thence
to
the
immense
pavilion
on
the
grounds
of
general
shian
only
one
toast
and
the
right
to
assemble
was
announced
to
be
drunk
and
then
a
commissary
of
police
could
enter
a
formal
protest
against
the
whole
proceeding
on
the
spot
on
which
to
base
a
legal
prosecution
and
the
multitude
would
disperse
a
very
sensible
mode
of
procedure
quietly
remarked
the
journalist
and
one
eminently
calculated
to
relieve
your
friend
guizot
and
my
friend
barrot
from
the
awkward
dilemma
of
a
direct
issue
but
so
thought
not
my
friend
guizot
like
his
oracle
the
sage
montesquieu
he
thought
assembles
the
people
causes
them
to
revolt
he
took
fright
at
the
manifesto
as
he
was
pleased
to
dignify
the
simple
programme
in
this
morning
and
so
early
in
the
sitting
it
was
announced
that
the
reform
banquet
was
utterly
prohibited
by
delessert
préfect
of
police
on
the
express
injunction
and
responsibility
of
duchatel
minister
of
the
interior
by
and
with
the
advice
of
hebert
minister
of
justice
ha
and
what
said
odillon
barrot
cried
the
journalist
he
why
he
said
nothing
at
all
but
immediately
retired
at
the
head
of
the
opposition
from
the
chamber
to
consult
of
course
an
hour
after
they
returned
in
a
body
two
hundred
and
fifty
strong
with
barrot
at
their
head
who
at
once
mounted
the
tribune
and
denounced
the
despotism
of
the
ministry
in
forbidding
the
peaceful
assembling
of
the
citizens
without
tumult
or
arms
to
discuss
their
political
rights
duchatel
replied
under
great
excitement
reform
committees
dare
to
call
out
the
national
guard
at
their
pleasure
he
asked
you
dare
to
call
out
the
national
guard
retorted
de
courtais
fiercely
try
it
government
of
france
will
never
yield
rejoined
the
minister
pale
with
fury
in
your
own
name
monsieur
shouted
flocon
shall
never
speak
in
yours
was
the
answer
play
the
game
of
menace
cried
lesseps
government
will
never
yield
again
vociferated
duchatel
were
the
very
words
of
charles
observed
dantès
sternly
the
entire
left
responded
in
a
terrific
roar
is
blood
in
those
words
shouted
ledru
rollin
government
will
never
yield
the
minister
of
the
interior
for
the
third
time
vehemently
exclaimed
and
the
right
gathered
around
him
is
worse
than
polignac
or
peyronet
vociferated
odillon
barrot
his
trumpet
tones
rising
above
all
others
like
a
clarion
in
a
tempest
those
hated
names
were
greeted
by
a
yell
of
abhorrence
perfectly
savage
from
the
left
then
all
was
uproar
a
dozen
voices
simultaneously
shouting
at
their
loudest
denunciation
menace
defiance
retort
clenched
hands
extended
arms
furious
gesticulations
every
one
on
fiery
eyes
stamping
feet
shouts
of
order
order
and
amid
all
the
incessant
tinkling
of
old
sauzet
little
silver
bell
which
was
just
about
as
effective
in
restoring
peace
as
it
would
be
to
quiet
the
tempest
now
howling
through
the
streets
of
paris
at
length
in
utter
consternation
and
dismay
the
old
president
put
on
his
hat
and
pronouncing
the
séance
ended
rushed
from
his
chair
amid
a
hurricane
of
uproarious
shouts
and
odillon
barrot
odillon
barrot
led
the
opposition
members
immediately
from
the
chamber
to
his
own
house
where
they
have
been
ever
since
in
deliberation
it
was
six
when
the
sitting
closed
and
they
must
be
in
consultation
now
or
barrot
would
surely
be
here
if
but
for
a
moment
out
of
respect
to
his
bosom
friend
our
host
ah
there
he
is
just
entering
surrounded
by
a
perfect
army
of
republicans
de
courtais
marrast
lesseps
duvergier
flocon
lamartine
dupont
and
a
whole
host
besides
how
excited
they
look
exclaimed
the
journalist
ah
thiers
approaches
them
from
the
other
end
of
the
salon
thiers
like
the
and
selfish
man
he
is
has
held
himself
aloof
from
the
banquet
and
even
declined
the
invitation
accepted
by
a
hundred
of
his
party
he
was
absent
from
the
chamber
and
from
the
conclave
all
with
the
aspiring
yet
vain
hope
that
the
king
will
send
for
him
to
form
a
ministry
and
yet
in
the
chamber
a
few
days
ago
he
said
that
he
was
of
the
party
of
the
revolution
in
europe
true
but
he
added
that
he
wished
the
revolution
carried
on
by
its
moderate
supporters
and
that
he
should
do
all
he
could
to
keep
it
in
the
hands
of
the
moderate
party
if
it
should
pass
into
the
hands
of
a
party
not
moderate
continued
the
crafty
shall
not
abandon
the
cause
of
the
revolution
i
shall
be
always
of
the
party
of
the
revolution
but
see
he
singles
out
marrast
of
all
others
and
his
old
colleague
of
national
seems
to
give
him
no
very
cordial
reception
added
the
deputy
but
let
us
move
up
and
hear
the
determination
of
the
opposition
relative
to
the
banquet
that
the
very
question
the
little
historian
has
just
propounded
to
the
great
journalist
now
for
the
answer
the
opposition
decide
monsieur
to
abandon
the
banquet
was
the
angry
reply
of
the
editor
to
the
indeed
was
the
bland
rejoinder
and
has
a
manifesto
of
this
decision
been
issued
to
the
people
it
has
and
it
instantly
called
forth
a
counter
manifesto
from
the
electoral
committee
of
the
twelfth
arrondissement
expressing
very
natural
astonishment
that
at
the
same
time
the
opposition
abandoned
the
banquet
they
had
not
abandoned
their
seats
in
the
chamber
and
inviting
them
so
to
do
at
once
and
the
ministry
anxiously
asked
thiers
will
be
impeached
monsieur
ah
indeed
indeed
cried
the
smart
little
aspirant
gleefully
rubbing
his
hands
at
that
moment
general
lamoricière
the
of
thiers
who
owed
so
much
to
the
house
of
orléans
hastily
approached
i
come
straight
from
the
tuileries
he
said
with
considerable
excitement
general
jacqueminot
has
just
issued
an
order
of
the
day
as
of
the
national
guard
appealing
to
them
as
the
constitutional
protectors
of
the
throne
to
take
no
part
in
the
banquet
orders
have
also
been
issued
for
the
rappel
to
be
beaten
at
dawn
in
the
quartier
honoré
the
scene
of
the
contemplated
procession
but
it
all
folly
to
rely
on
the
national
guard
they
are
of
the
people
only
the
municipal
guard
and
the
troops
of
the
line
can
be
relied
on
in
the
civil
conflict
which
is
sure
to
come
and
the
ministers
what
do
they
asked
thiers
oh
they
are
not
idle
replied
the
soldier
the
bastilles
are
armed
and
those
of
montrouge
and
aubervilliers
are
provisioned
the
at
vincennes
are
ready
on
the
instant
to
gallop
into
the
capital
seventy
additional
pieces
of
ordnance
are
now
entering
the
barrières
the
municipal
guard
are
supplied
with
the
troops
concentrated
at
sunrise
will
not
be
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
strong
with
these
men
in
the
forts
and
faithful
the
city
can
be
starved
in
three
days
national
guard
and
all
if
rebellious
now
is
the
crisis
in
which
to
test
the
remarkable
admission
of
duchatel
in
may
that
the
bastilles
of
paris
were
designed
to
order
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
and
the
marshal
duke
of
islay
where
is
he
quietly
asked
marrast
with
a
significant
shrug
and
smile
at
this
mention
of
his
bitter
foe
a
frown
lowered
on
the
fine
face
of
lamoricière
as
he
briefly
and
sternly
replied
with
the
king
monsieur
general
bugeaud
is
with
the
king
but
they
mistake
monsieur
eugène
cavaignac
is
the
man
for
this
emergency
bugeaud
is
a
soldier
a
mere
soldier
cavaignac
is
a
statesman
a
napoleon
paris
will
discriminate
between
the
two
one
day
and
that
shortly
and
with
an
abrupt
military
salute
the
conqueror
of
algeria
walked
away
followed
by
his
little
who
seemed
yet
shorter
and
more
insignificant
at
the
side
of
his
towering
and
graceful
form
at
the
same
moment
ledru
rollin
entered
in
great
agitation
and
having
glanced
hastily
around
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
in
the
assemblage
advanced
straight
to
the
journalist
and
grasped
his
hand
by
heavens
armand
i
think
the
hour
has
arrived
whence
do
you
come
was
the
quick
question
from
the
boulevards
where
i
left
flocon
louis
blanc
and
dantès
with
the
people
i
tell
you
armand
the
people
are
ripe
ripe
the
ministerial
ordinances
prohibiting
the
banquet
have
kindled
a
flame
wherever
they
have
gone
the
pitiful
manifesto
of
the
opposition
and
the
counter
manifesto
of
the
twelfth
arrondissement
have
only
served
to
fan
this
flame
into
fury
it
has
been
our
care
to
restrain
and
direct
not
to
excite
it
is
dark
and
cold
without
armand
the
winter
wind
howls
dismally
along
the
streets
the
sleet
freezes
as
it
falls
and
the
furious
blast
almost
extinguishes
the
torches
by
which
at
the
corners
and
at
the
cafés
the
different
manifestoes
of
the
day
are
being
read
to
the
eager
throngs
on
whose
faces
in
the
flare
of
the
light
can
be
perceived
the
fury
of
their
hearts
the
people
at
length
are
ripe
all
paris
will
be
in
arms
while
ledru
rollin
was
thus
speaking
louis
blanc
entered
and
quietly
approached
courteously
saluting
his
acquaintances
on
his
way
and
stopping
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
madame
dantès
who
inquired
with
considerable
anxiety
for
her
husband
i
have
this
moment
left
him
madame
said
louis
blanc
be
assured
he
is
safe
and
well
ah
how
glorious
to
be
an
object
of
solicitude
to
one
like
you
he
added
with
a
smile
the
lady
smiled
also
and
offered
an
appropriate
jest
in
reply
to
the
gallantry
of
the
distinguished
author
as
he
moved
on
to
join
his
friends
the
ministry
provokes
its
fate
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
he
approached
the
gods
would
destroy
they
first
make
mad
these
men
suffered
seventy
reform
banquets
all
over
france
the
one
they
prohibit
and
that
too
by
the
exhumation
of
an
old
despotic
edict
of
this
is
exactly
what
we
would
have
it
was
the
first
not
the
last
banquet
they
should
have
suppressed
barrot
was
right
in
the
chamber
when
he
said
that
had
this
manifestation
been
suffered
the
people
would
have
become
tranquil
tranquil
indeed
cried
ledru
rollin
that
exactly
what
we
have
apprehended
no
no
it
is
too
late
this
reform
banquet
was
at
first
but
an
insignificant
thing
in
it
we
now
recognize
the
commencement
of
a
revolution
the
various
announcements
and
postponements
of
this
banquet
have
caused
an
agitation
among
the
masses
favorable
to
our
wishes
and
the
threats
and
obstinacy
of
the
ministry
have
completed
the
work
the
hopes
fears
doubts
and
disappointments
attending
this
affair
have
put
the
mind
of
all
paris
in
a
ferment
and
excited
passions
of
which
we
may
take
immediate
advantage
aye
cried
louis
blanc
we
may
now
do
what
i
have
always
wished
and
counseled
we
the
communists
may
now
take
advantage
of
a
movement
in
the
origin
or
inception
of
which
we
had
no
hand
true
most
true
observed
marrast
this
is
the
work
of
the
dynastics
thiers
barrot
and
the
rest
the
commencement
of
a
reform
under
the
law
which
we
design
to
make
a
revolution
paramount
to
all
law
they
begin
to
fear
already
that
they
have
gone
too
far
those
discreet
men
said
louis
blanc
smiling
bitterly
did
you
observe
how
they
shuffled
at
barrot
and
finally
resolved
to
abandon
the
banquet
but
as
a
sop
to
the
people
pledged
themselves
to
impeach
the
ministry
ah
ha
ha
laughed
ledru
rollin
just
as
if
their
abandonment
of
the
banquet
is
to
keep
the
people
away
from
it
any
more
than
the
ministerial
ordinances
why
not
one
man
in
ten
thousand
knows
of
the
existence
of
these
manifestoes
but
the
faubourgs
have
been
promised
a
holiday
for
a
fortnight
past
and
they
do
intend
to
be
put
off
again
whether
the
dynastics
designed
or
wished
to
be
compromised
in
this
affair
remarked
marrast
they
certainly
are
committed
now
and
it
is
too
late
for
them
to
get
out
of
the
movement
indeed
i
view
it
as
nothing
less
than
a
union
of
all
the
oppositions
against
the
crown
aye
against
the
crown
and
for
a
republic
we
comprehend
this
they
do
they
have
not
like
us
waited
seventeen
years
for
a
signal
for
revolution
and
now
before
god
i
believe
the
hour
is
at
hand
this
is
no
accidental
insurrection
of
the
and
of
june
no
outbreak
at
a
funeral
no
riot
of
operatives
no
unmeaning
revolt
as
in
it
is
a
reform
with
the
first
names
in
france
as
its
advocates
and
supporters
which
we
will
make
a
revolution
if
we
can
secure
the
national
guard
the
national
guard
is
secured
already
said
louis
blanc
are
they
not
of
the
people
at
least
twenty
thousand
of
the
national
guard
are
republicans
of
the
remaining
forty
thousand
nearly
all
are
well
disposed
or
neutral
in
feeling
have
i
studied
the
national
guard
for
twenty
years
in
vain
and
have
all
the
measures
of
the
communists
to
secure
them
when
the
crisis
came
on
proved
utterly
ineffectual
on
the
national
guard
we
may
rely
the
municipal
guard
are
picked
men
and
well
paid
to
support
the
throne
they
will
fight
even
better
than
the
line
with
the
line
and
the
national
guard
the
people
must
seek
to
fraternize
from
the
beginning
with
the
other
troops
they
have
solely
to
fight
but
after
all
general
facts
and
principles
only
can
be
laid
down
circumstances
utterly
beyond
human
control
must
direct
and
govern
and
vary
and
determine
results
when
the
period
of
action
arrives
and
arrive
it
may
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
at
this
moment
paris
sleeps
on
a
volcano
the
fires
of
which
have
long
been
gathering
through
many
a
fair
and
sunny
day
god
only
knows
when
the
volcano
will
burst
but
when
the
hour
comes
let
the
people
be
prepared
as
these
enthusiastic
words
were
uttered
the
dark
eye
of
the
speaker
flashed
and
his
lip
quivered
the
silver
clock
on
the
mantel
beside
which
the
conspirators
stood
struck
the
first
quarter
after
two
the
night
was
waning
but
the
festivity
seemed
rather
to
increase
than
diminish
within
the
salons
of
the
magnificent
mansion
while
the
storm
howled
even
more
drearily
without
and
the
rain
at
intervals
in
heavy
blasts
beat
even
more
fiercely
against
the
northern
casements
as
louis
blanc
ceased
speaking
flocon
entered
the
salon
and
as
if
by
some
preconcerted
arrangement
at
once
sought
his
political
friends
what
of
the
night
watchman
cried
ledru
rollin
as
the
editor
of
la
réforme
approached
the
latest
news
for
of
an
hour
age
doth
hiss
the
speaker
as
the
english
shakespeare
says
the
news
good
or
bad
as
i
entered
said
flocon
the
house
trembled
with
the
jar
of
a
train
of
heavy
ordnance
attended
by
tumbrels
and
artillery
caissons
and
escorted
by
a
regiment
of
horse
which
rolled
along
the
pavement
of
the
champs
elysées
good
answered
marrast
with
enthusiasm
all
night
continued
flocon
eagerly
through
darkness
and
storm
whole
regiments
of
infantry
have
thronged
the
line
of
boulevards
which
stretch
from
the
tuileries
to
vincennes
and
each
soldier
bears
upon
his
knapsack
in
addition
to
all
his
arms
an
axe
to
demolish
barricades
the
garrisons
of
the
arrondissements
of
paris
are
already
seventy
thousand
strong
and
the
troops
of
the
line
are
concentrating
around
the
palais
bourbon
and
the
chamber
of
deputies
excellent
most
excellent
joyfully
exclaimed
louis
blanc
the
affront
will
not
be
wanting
but
where
is
m
dantès
he
is
still
with
the
chiefs
of
the
faubourgs
and
the
committees
of
the
and
workmen
in
the
rue
lepelletier
issuing
his
last
instructions
for
the
morrow
messieurs
that
man
is
a
magician
his
zeal
in
the
good
cause
puts
the
boldest
of
us
all
to
the
blush
by
most
indefatigable
energy
and
indomitable
perseverance
he
has
brought
about
a
systematic
almost
scientific
organization
and
fraternity
through
various
modes
of
rapid
intercommunication
between
the
innumerable
classes
of
operatives
of
every
description
throughout
the
whole
capital
and
its
faubourgs
so
that
within
six
hours
he
can
have
in
military
array
an
armed
mass
of
one
hundred
thousand
blouses
upon
the
boulevards
the
workshops
alone
he
tells
me
can
furnish
fifty
thousand
the
rapidity
with
which
he
conveys
intelligence
through
this
immense
army
and
their
utter
subservience
to
his
will
and
subordination
to
his
orders
are
all
so
wonderful
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
which
is
most
so
to
control
a
parisian
populace
has
hitherto
been
deemed
a
chimera
with
dantès
it
is
an
existing
reality
not
an
army
in
europe
is
so
obedient
or
so
prompt
as
his
army
of
workmen
the
secret
is
this
they
know
him
to
be
their
friend
all
over
paris
are
to
be
seen
his
workshops
savings
banks
hospitals
and
houses
of
industry
and
reform
and
in
the
suburbs
his
phalansteries
and
his
model
farms
that
he
has
the
command
of
boundless
wealth
is
certain
but
whose
it
is
or
whence
it
comes
no
one
can
divine
and
never
did
man
make
use
of
boundless
wealth
to
attain
his
ends
more
wisely
than
he
does
why
i
am
told
that
the
pens
of
half
the
littérateurs
and
feuilletonists
of
paris
have
for
years
past
been
guided
by
his
will
and
compensated
from
his
purse
to
accomplish
his
purposes
mysteries
of
paris
and
wandering
jew
are
but
two
of
the
triumphs
of
his
policy
and
his
system
of
philanthropy
seems
not
bounded
by
france
but
to
embrace
all
europe
the
swiss
protestant
and
the
italian
patriot
have
each
felt
his
effective
sympathy
as
well
as
the
french
workman
and
in
the
same
manner
as
with
the
operatives
so
has
he
obtained
influence
and
weight
with
the
national
guard
and
to
such
an
extent
that
of
the
sixty
thousand
would
obey
his
orders
with
greater
alacrity
than
those
of
jacqueminot
himself
i
tell
you
messieurs
he
is
a
magician
hush
hush
cried
marrast
he
is
entering
now
he
pauses
and
looks
around
him
said
louis
blanc
he
looks
for
us
i
will
go
to
him
remarked
flocon
he
looks
for
his
wife
replied
louis
blanc
there
he
catches
her
eye
see
how
eagerly
she
flies
to
him
that
is
the
finest
pair
in
paris
remarked
the
journalist
and
the
most
devoted
added
ledru
rollin
they
have
been
man
and
wife
for
some
time
it
is
said
and
any
one
would
take
them
for
lovers
at
this
moment
have
they
children
asked
flocon
no
but
dantès
has
by
a
former
wife
a
son
and
daughter
who
rival
in
good
looks
the
celebrated
children
of
our
friend
victor
hugo
returned
louis
blanc
i
met
arago
lamartine
sue
châteaubriand
and
some
other
celebrities
at
his
mansion
in
the
rue
du
helder
one
night
recently
continued
marrast
and
i
thought
i
never
saw
a
house
arranged
with
such
perfect
taste
the
salons
library
cabinet
of
natural
history
conservatory
and
laboratory
were
superb
everything
in
short
was
exquisite
and
then
one
is
always
sure
to
meet
at
madame
dantès
soirées
added
louis
blanc
exactly
the
persons
who
of
all
others
he
wishes
to
see
and
whom
he
would
meet
nowhere
else
poets
painters
authors
orators
statesmen
and
artists
of
every
description
in
fine
every
man
or
woman
whether
native
or
foreigner
distinguished
for
anything
is
certain
to
be
met
with
at
dantès
house
i
once
met
there
said
flocon
rachel
the
actress
and
van
amburgh
the
dantès
is
a
perfect
mæcenas
in
encouraging
merit
as
every
one
knows
remarked
marrast
and
he
manifests
especial
solicitude
to
show
that
he
appreciates
worth
more
highly
than
wealth
genius
than
station
poverty
and
ability
are
sure
recommendations
to
him
madame
dantès
is
i
am
told
as
devoted
to
the
good
cause
as
her
husband
remarked
flocon
she
is
a
second
madame
roland
exclaimed
louis
blanc
france
will
owe
much
to
such
women
as
she
and
her
friend
madame
dudevant
she
differs
greatly
from
madame
george
sand
in
some
respects
i
fancy
said
marrast
but
if
she
at
all
rivals
that
wonderful
woman
in
devotedness
to
the
cause
of
human
rights
whether
of
her
own
sex
or
ours
she
deserves
well
of
france
in
her
charities
it
is
notorious
she
has
no
rival
half
the
mendicants
of
the
capital
bless
her
name
and
she
is
at
the
head
of
a
dozen
associations
and
enterprises
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
destitute
suffering
and
abandoned
of
her
sex
upon
my
word
messieurs
cried
ledru
rollin
your
praises
of
dantès
and
madame
his
beautiful
wife
are
perfectly
enthusiastic
so
much
so
that
in
your
zeal
you
utterly
forgot
another
matter
quite
as
momentous
i
am
so
unfortunate
as
to
know
dantès
only
as
one
of
the
great
pillars
of
our
noble
cause
and
a
man
who
for
nearly
six
years
has
proven
himself
an
apostle
of
man
rights
and
ready
if
need
be
to
become
a
martyr
that
enough
for
me
to
know
of
him
but
who
really
are
dantès
and
his
wife
asked
flocon
who
really
are
any
of
us
laughingly
rejoined
louis
blanc
who
really
is
any
one
in
paris
continued
marrast
the
always
and
alone
excepted
of
dantès
this
only
is
known
said
louis
blanc
that
for
five
or
six
years
past
he
has
been
a
deputy
from
marseilles
lyons
and
other
southern
cities
all
of
which
have
been
eager
to
honor
themselves
by
returning
him
as
their
representative
as
one
of
the
boldest
and
most
eloquent
republicans
in
all
france
as
for
madame
dantès
we
know
her
to
have
once
been
the
countess
de
morcerf
but
now
the
wife
of
our
friend
and
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
lovely
matrons
in
paris
what
need
have
we
to
know
more
but
our
friend
comes
while
this
conversation
was
proceeding
dantès
and
mercédès
had
joined
each
other
and
their
hands
were
quietly
clasped
is
all
well
edmond
was
the
anxious
inquiry
of
the
fond
wife
in
low
soft
musical
tones
as
she
fixed
upon
his
pale
face
her
dark
eyes
beaming
with
the
tenderest
solicitude
all
is
well
love
replied
the
husband
you
will
pardon
my
protracted
absence
when
i
tell
you
it
has
been
unavoidable
will
you
not
mercédès
will
i
not
what
a
question
but
i
have
been
so
anxious
for
your
safety
knowing
the
perilous
business
in
which
you
are
engaged
and
the
night
is
so
tempestuous
you
forget
that
i
have
a
constitution
of
iron
dear
replied
dantès
you
forget
that
i
was
a
sailor
once
and
the
storms
were
my
playthings
but
you
will
go
home
with
me
now
edmond
will
you
not
she
anxiously
asked
placing
her
little
white
hand
on
his
arm
and
gazing
beseechingly
into
his
eyes
have
i
ever
passed
one
night
from
your
arms
my
mercédès
since
we
were
wed
was
the
whispered
response
ah
love
any
pillow
but
thy
soft
bosom
would
be
to
me
a
thorny
one
you
have
spoiled
me
forever
he
added
smiling
and
shall
we
go
now
edmond
eagerly
asked
the
delighted
woman
oh
i
so
weary
of
this
fête
i
must
exchange
a
few
words
with
our
friend
louis
blanc
whom
i
see
yonder
with
others
of
our
party
and
then
dear
we
will
to
our
pillow
we
are
both
weary
au
revoir
edmond
edmond
cried
the
lady
as
her
husband
was
going
do
you
see
joliette
and
louise
in
the
redowa
yonder
dantès
looked
and
with
a
well
pleased
smile
nodded
assent
a
more
brilliant
and
pair
could
hardly
have
been
found
joliette
in
the
splendid
uniform
of
an
officer
of
the
spahis
and
she
in
her
own
magnificent
beauty
fitly
garbed
dantès
was
received
with
marked
respect
by
the
knot
of
republicans
as
he
approached
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
all
and
to
meet
you
or
rather
this
morning
said
dantès
warmly
in
order
that
i
may
render
you
an
account
of
my
stewardship
for
the
past
six
hours
they
have
been
hours
big
with
fate
and
the
first
day
of
republican
france
has
already
commenced
messieurs
we
can
no
longer
remain
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
long
looked
for
hoped
for
expected
hour
has
come
the
hour
to
strike
strike
home
for
liberty
and
for
france
the
streets
of
paris
will
swarm
with
blouses
the
marseillaise
will
be
heard
barricades
rise
the
ministry
be
impeached
next
day
the
national
guards
will
fraternize
with
the
people
blood
will
flow
the
ministry
resign
on
the
third
the
king
abdicates
the
tuileries
are
surrendered
a
regency
is
refused
a
republic
is
declared
and
this
day
two
weeks
hence
liberty
will
be
shouted
in
the
streets
of
vienna
and
berlin
and
every
throne
in
europe
will
tremble
the
honors
of
prophecy
are
easily
won
continued
the
speaker
with
a
significant
smile
that
lighted
up
his
features
pale
with
enthusiasm
and
exhaustion
when
the
problem
of
seventeen
years
approaches
solution
with
mathematical
certainty
are
our
plans
all
complete
asked
louis
blanc
so
far
as
human
forethought
or
power
could
render
them
so
our
efforts
have
i
trust
been
effectual
was
the
reply
yet
the
events
of
every
hour
will
induce
changes
and
render
indispensable
policy
now
undreamed
of
ah
messieurs
we
must
none
of
us
sleep
now
not
a
moment
must
escape
our
vigilance
not
an
advantage
must
be
sacrificed
we
can
afford
to
lose
nothing
without
leaders
the
people
are
blind
not
for
an
instant
must
they
be
abandoned
let
the
masses
gather
at
different
points
next
day
let
barricades
choke
the
boulevards
and
if
the
conflict
come
not
be
it
precipitated
provoked
thursday
an
hundred
thousand
men
must
invest
the
tuileries
and
a
provisional
government
be
declared
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
bourbons
will
then
be
in
full
flight
and
france
will
be
free
and
now
messieurs
will
you
permit
me
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
our
separation
yonder
ministerial
secretary
has
had
his
eye
upon
us
ever
since
he
entered
the
expediency
of
the
suggestion
of
dantès
was
at
once
perceived
the
conspirators
parted
and
one
after
the
other
by
different
routes
shortly
disappeared
as
for
dantès
he
threw
himself
carelessly
in
the
way
of
the
ministerial
secretary
to
whom
he
had
alluded
who
was
no
other
than
our
friend
lucien
debray
and
saluted
him
with
most
marked
and
winning
courtesy
will
the
ministerial
secretary
suffer
me
to
compliment
him
upon
his
indefatigable
industry
and
exertions
to
fortify
order
in
paris
and
sustain
the
administration
debray
bowed
somewhat
confusedly
at
this
remark
and
having
returned
a
diplomatic
reply
from
which
neither
himself
nor
any
one
else
could
have
elicited
an
idea
dantès
continued
the
conversation
let
me
see
it
is
now
nearly
three
he
said
consulting
his
repeater
at
two
you
received
an
order
signed
by
the
duke
of
montpensier
and
directed
to
the
war
ministry
commanding
that
additional
pieces
of
artillery
be
transported
from
vincennes
to
paris
before
dawn
that
order
was
issued
and
the
ordnance
is
now
on
the
boulevard
how
exclaimed
the
astonished
secretary
at
vincennes
the
horses
of
the
flying
artillery
stand
harnessed
in
their
stalls
all
night
infantry
have
been
pouring
into
paris
and
obedient
to
midnight
orders
every
railway
will
disgorge
at
dawn
additional
troops
are
you
a
magician
asked
the
astonished
secretary
shall
i
reveal
to
you
the
ministerial
tactics
for
the
apprehended
insurrection
coolly
asked
dantès
with
a
smile
the
salons
of
the
tuileries
have
not
been
deserted
you
quell
an
insurrection
general
asked
the
king
of
the
marshal
duke
of
islay
can
kill
thirty
thousand
men
was
the
humane
answer
i
sire
can
preserve
order
in
paris
without
killing
a
score
said
marshal
gérard
the
hero
of
antwerp
i
can
rely
on
my
men
is
your
plan
marshal
asked
the
king
shall
i
give
you
the
marshal
reply
my
friend
you
were
present
you
know
all
exclaimed
debray
not
quite
all
thought
dantès
but
i
shall
before
we
part
well
continued
he
aloud
the
marshal
strategy
was
this
exceedingly
simple
and
exceedingly
efficacious
too
provided
to
use
the
own
words
he
can
rely
on
his
men
it
is
this
occupy
the
tuileries
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
halles
the
louvre
and
other
prominent
points
with
a
heavy
reserve
of
infantry
and
artillery
and
sweep
the
boulevards
and
the
rues
honoré
de
rivoli
martin
denis
montmartre
and
richelieu
with
cavalry
a
simple
plan
is
it
not
almost
as
simple
as
that
of
the
insurrectionists
themselves
a
barricade
on
every
street
and
one
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
place
du
carrousel
the
government
will
not
yield
monsieur
said
debray
firmly
the
minister
is
unshaken
to
crush
an
unarmed
mob
can
not
severely
tax
the
most
skillful
generals
in
europe
true
they
are
unarmed
returned
dantès
with
apparent
seriousness
their
leaders
should
have
thought
of
that
arms
are
so
easily
provided
but
then
they
can
rely
on
their
men
we
have
yet
to
see
that
replied
debray
with
some
asperity
true
we
have
yet
to
see
it
it
is
only
a
matter
of
belief
now
then
it
will
be
a
matter
of
knowledge
seeing
is
knowing
added
dantès
with
his
peculiar
smile
but
pray
assure
me
debray
are
the
ministry
and
their
advisers
indeed
sanguine
of
the
issue
they
are
certain
replied
the
secretary
with
energy
then
feeling
that
he
had
perhaps
made
a
dangerous
revelation
he
quickly
added
i
have
the
honor
monsieur
to
wish
you
a
very
good
night
it
is
late
say
rather
it
is
early
monsieur
replied
dantès
i
have
the
honor
to
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
the
secretary
returned
the
courtesy
turned
away
and
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
thiers
disappeared
they
are
certain
then
soliloquized
dantès
as
debray
quitted
the
salon
i
was
sure
i
should
know
all
before
he
left
then
rejoining
mercédès
who
was
patiently
awaiting
him
they
stepped
into
their
carriage
as
the
drowsy
tones
of
the
watchman
rose
on
the
misty
air
past
four
and
all
is
well

and
the
first
of
the
three
days
of
the
french
revolution
of
broke
darkly
and
gloomily
on
paris
the
night
had
been
tempestuous
and
the
wind
still
drove
the
sleet
through
the
leafless
trees
of
the
and
howled
drearily
along
the
cheerless
boulevards
the
streets
were
dismal
desolate
and
deserted
here
and
there
however
through
the
gray
light
of
the
winter
dawn
could
be
caught
the
semblance
of
a
figure
closely
muffled
whether
for
concealment
disguise
or
protection
from
the
biting
blast
was
doubtful
stealing
along
these
figures
often
met
and
exchanged
ominous
signs
of
recognition
is
the
procession
still
to
take
place
asked
one
of
another
of
these
persons
pausing
for
an
instant
as
they
hurried
along
yes
was
the
emphatic
answer
dupont
lamartine
and
the
sixteen
others
who
are
faithful
are
resolute
and
the
rendezvous
is
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
the
hour
twelve
whereupon
the
conspirators
parted
gradually
the
number
of
persons
in
the
streets
increased
as
the
morning
advanced
chiefly
these
were
artisans
lads
blouses
and
workmen
whither
so
early
this
disagreeable
morning
cried
a
shopman
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
who
was
taking
down
his
shutters
for
the
day
to
a
friend
who
was
hurrying
by
i
do
exactly
know
where
i
am
going
was
the
reply
we
were
all
roused
at
daybreak
in
the
quartier
honoré
by
the
rappel
and
so
i
happen
to
be
awake
and
are
the
national
guard
turning
out
in
good
numbers

they
do
turn
out
at
all
the
drummers

followed
by
a
crowd
of
gamins
in
blouses
who
shout
vive
la
réforme
and
sing
the
marseillaise
the
national
guard
do
turn
out
cried
the
alarmed
shopman
then
i
not
take
down
my
shutters
and
as
his
friend
moved
on
to
the
madeleine
he
took
the
precautionary
measure
he
had
spoken
of
at
nine
troops
were
in
motion
all
over
paris
and
the
roll
of
the
drum
was
heard
in

ready
to

on
the
throng
at

two
thousand
students
in
blouses
from
the
parthenon
were
joined
by
an
immense
column
of
workmen
from
the
faubourgs
and
having
fraternized
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
advanced
in
perfect
order
in
procession
led
by
national
guards
shouting
the
marseillaise
and
the
hymn
of
the
girondins
slowly
and
solemnly
moved
the
vast
mass
up
the
rue
royale
to
the
pont
de
la
concorde
leading
to
the
place
of
the
chamber
of

was
drawn
up
a
regiment
of

a
man
in
a
sash
three
times
read
the
summons
and
ordered
the
crowd
disperse
the
order
is
disregarded
the
charge
is
sounded
the
dragoons
rush
with
sheathed
sabres
on
the
mass
again
and
again
they
charge
but
they
cut
down
none
all
at
once
a
heavy
cart
with
a
powerful
horse
is
discovered
the
people
seize
it
the
horse
is
lashed
into
fury
he
rushes
on
the
double
line
of
dragoons
and
chasseurs
a
breach
is
made
the
crowd
dash
through
some
rush
up
the
steps
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
they
force
the
gates
they
even
enter
the
hall
then
suddenly
at
their
own
audacity
they
rush
back
at
this
moment
along
the
quai
gallops
up
a
strong
detachment
of
the
mounted
municipal
guard
led
by
general
peyronet

and
uncle
of

the
crowd
was
driven
over

and
the
municipal
guard
a
company
of

and
a
squadron
of

took
up
a
position
at
the
foot
of

shouted
the
people
down
with
the

guard
accompanied
by
hootings
groans
shouts
and
showers
of
stones
the
troops
with
sheathed
sabres
charged
one
of
the
immense
fountains
afforded
the
gamins
a
place
of
shelter
suddenly
the
flood
of
water
was
let
on
and
they
fled
thus
began
the
revolution
one
tolled
from
the

of
the

area
was
clear

bearing
besides
their

at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
capucines
and
the
boulevard
an
immense
mass
of
men
ebbed
and
flowed
like
tides
of
the
sea
and
a
tempest
of
shouts
groans
and
choruses
to
national
songs
arose
a
commissary
of
police
in
colored
clothes
and
with
the
sash
led
a
body
of
municipal
guards
into
the
court
deliberately
they
charge
their
muskets
with
ball
in
the
name
of

the

slowly
retired

a

embassy

cut

replied
the
artisan
calmly
with
folded
arms
at
that
moment
a
body
of
the
people
rushed
on
the
municipal
guards
and
drove
them
for
safety
into
their
barracks
then
they
fled
themselves
to
avoid
the
fusillade
of
the
enraged
troops
on
the
pont
de
la
concorde
the
people
stopped
the
carriage
of
a
ministerial

time

shouts
down
with

were
heard
and
also
the
roll

as
a
body
of
troops

around

order
in

it
was
twelve
at
night
on
the
of

lights
still
gleamed
in
the
vast
edifice
of
le
national
printing
office
and
in
the
editorial
chamber
were
assembled
the
chiefs
of
the
revolution
all
goes
well
said
louis
blanc
the
blow
is
struck
let
it
only
be
followed
up
and
the
efforts
of
the
past
ten
years
will
not
prove
vain
how
true
was
the
opinion
of
dantès
respecting
the
national
guard
said
marrast
how
true
also
respecting
the
workmen
said
albert
how
true
respecting
the
ministry
said
ledru
rollin
but
where
is
dantès
why
is
he
not
here
at
that
moment
the
private
door
opened
and
dantès
flocon
and
lamartine
entered
the
news
from
the
chambers
cried
marrast
as
they
approached
three
impeachments
of
the
ministry
have
been
proposed
said
lamartine
by
whom
by
whom
asked
louis
blanc
by
whom
presented
one
by
odillon
barrot
one
by
duvergier
and
one
by
de
genoude
deputy
from
toulouse
and
what
said
guizot
asked
marrast
nothing
he
only
laughed
when
the
papers
were
handed
him
by
old
president
sauzet
ah
cried
ledru
rollin
few
deputies
were
there
continued
flocon
the
opposition
benches
were
vacant
guizot
was
there
early
pale
and
troubled
but
stern
and
unbending
all
the
ministers
followed
him
what
was
discussed
asked
marrast
the
bordeaux
bank
bill
ah
cried
ledru
rollin
again
yes
continued
flocon
until
five
that
bill
was
discussed
barrot
then
ascended
the
tribune
and
deposited
a
general
proposition
to
impeach
the
ministry
and
what
was
done
with
it
asked
louis
blanc
the
president
raised
the
sitting
without
reading
it
but
announced
that
the
bureaux
should
have
it
for
examination
on
thursday
infamous
cried
ledru
rollin
it
is
all
as
it
should
be
said
dantès
calmly
and
the
peers
what
of
them
the
marquis
de
boissy
made
an
effort
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
state
of
paris
but
of
course
it
was
in
vain
is
it
true
asked
flocon
that
the
rappel
has
been
beaten
it
was
beaten
in
the
quartier
honoré
at
dawn
said
louis
blanc
and
this
evening
at
about
five
in
several
of
the
arrondissements
but
no
reliance
need
be
placed
on
the
national
guard
they
are
with
us
they
are
of
the
people
they
shout
la
réforme
but
the
municipal
guard
and
the
line
i
am
told
that
an
immense
body
of
them
was
this
evening
at
about
eight
reviewed
by
the
king
and
the
dukes
of
nemours
and
montpensier
in
the
place
du
carrousel
said
flocon
that
true
said
ledru
rollin
i
witnessed
it
myself
in
passing
and
i
could
not
help
saying
is
the
last
six
thousand
troops
of
the
line
are
on
the
boulevards
from
the
madeleine
to
the
porte
martin
said
dantès
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
places
de
la
bastille
de
la
concorde
and
du
carrousel
and
the
quays
frown
with
artillery
will
be
a
warm
day
it
has
been
rather
warm
in
some
parts
of
paris
said
louis
blanc
smiling
was
there
ever
a
grander
spectacle
than
that
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
at
noon
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
men
were
there
assembled
rushing
across
the
bridge
they
gathered
around
the
chamber
of
deputies
then
from
the
southern
gate
of
the
tuileries
issued
two
bodies
of
troops
one
of
mounted
municipal
guards
the
other
infantry
of
the
line
and
pressing
on
the
dense
mass
they
drove
them
over
the
bridge
only
a
few
old
fruitwomen
were
crushed
beneath
the
horses
hoofs
and
a
few
of
the
troops
were
wounded
by
pebbles
however
at
the
same
time
said
flocon
all
the
chains
in
the
were
in
requisition
for
a
barricade
as
well
as
all
the
public
carriages
and
the
people
sang
the
marseillaise
the
parisienne
and
the
hymn
of
the
girondins
a
was
also
consumed
have
you
heard
bugeaud
remark
at
noon
when
looking
upon
the
place
de
la
concorde
asked
marrast
we
have
been
too
busy
to
hear
anything
said
ledru
rollin
we
shall
have
a
day
of
it
said
the
bloodthirsty
old
hero
care
not
for
the
day
said
the
pale
guizot
the
night
the
people
made
quite
a
demonstration
about
guizot
i
hear
said
flocon
they
assailed
him
with
a
shower
of
groans
it
is
said
and
some
of
the
gamins
flung
pebbles
at
his
gates
the
most
significant
shout
before
the
office
of
foreign
affairs
was
this
said
ledru
rollin
of
leven
where
is
the
minister
and
the
very
moment
this
was
occurring
said
flocon
i
understand
that
thiers
on
his
return
from
the
chamber
in
passing
through
the
narrowly
escaped
a
most
unwelcome
ovation
from
the
people
the
two
rivals
were
duly
and
simultaneously
honored
it
seems
thus
much
for
said
marrast
what
of
barricades
rise
all
over
paris
said
dantès
but
we
can
do
no
more
let
us
each
retire
to
his
home
the
national
guard
will
fraternize
with
the
people
and
the
ministry
will
resign
a
few
words
of
parting
salutation
passed
and
all
departed
dantès
and
lamartine
left
the
office
in
company
what
say
you
edmond
asked
lamartine
will
your
wife
spare
you
long
enough
from
her
pillow
to
make
with
me
a
brief
tour
of
the
town
mercédès
is
rather
exacting
said
dantès
with
a
laugh
but
if
your
fair
lady
will
suffer
your
absence
mine
must
do
the
same
i
fear
well
then
let
us
first
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
that
grand
centre
of
paris
in
all
that
is
revolutionary
as
the
two
friends
passed
along
conversing
on
the
events
of
the
day
and
the
anticipations
of
the
morrow
they
were
met
from
time
to
time
by
knots
of
men
at
the
corners
eagerly
recounting
the
incidents
of
the
hour
the
roll
of
drums
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
occasionally
there
came
the
heavy
and
measured
tread
of
infantry
the
clatter
of
cavalry
and
the
lumbering
of
artillery
as
they
passed
on
their
way
all
the
shops
and
cafés
were
closed
many
of
the
lamps
were
demolished
and
others
were
not
lighted
the
gas
being
shut
off
a
fearful
gloom
brooded
over
the
city
the
winter
wind
swept
sharply
and
cuttingly
along
the
deserted
streets
and
rain
which
froze
as
it
fell
at
intervals
dashed
down
the
hôtel
de
ville
was
encompassed
by
troops
as
the
friends
approached
it
is
that
a
cannon
asked
lamartine
pointing
to
a
dark
object
that
protruded
from
an
embrasure
of
the
edifice
it
is
replied
dantès
then
the
revolution
has
indeed
begun
artillery
in
the
streets
of
paris
behind
each
column
of
the
portico
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
this
day
frowned
a
concealed
cannon
was
the
significant
response
the
friends
turned
off
from
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
crossing
the
right
branch
of
the
seine
were
under
the
deep
shadows
of
nôtre
dame
but
all
was
tranquil
and
still
only
the
howlings
of
the
wintry
blast
were
heard
through
the
towers
and
architectural
ornaments
of
the
old
pile
up
the
rue
jacques
into
the
quartier
latin
they
then
proceeded
but
the
students
and
the
grisettes
seemed
to
be
fast
asleep
turning
back
they
passed
the
fish
market
and
here
a
large
body
of
cavalry
had
bivouacked
patrols
marched
to
and
fro
officers
in
huge
dark
cloaks
smoked
laughed
and
chatted
regardless
of
the
morrow
the
friends
went
on
all
was
dark
in
the
faubourg
which
succeeded
not
a
light
gleamed
save
in
some
lofty
casement
the
fainting
candle
of
the
needlewoman
or
of
the
overtasked
student
ah
exclaimed
lamartine
as
they
passed
one
of
these
flickering
lights
who
knows
what
plotting
head
and
ready
hand
may
be
beside
that
candle
who
knows
of
the
weapon
burnished
the
cartridge
filled
and
the
sabre
sharpened
by
that
light
for
the
morrow
the
morrow
exclaimed
dantès
that
morrow
decides
the
fate
of
france
and
the
friends
parted
chapter

the
second
day
the
of
february
dawned
on
paris
as
a
city
under
arms
artillery
frowned
in
all
the
public
places
the
barricades
of
the
preceding
night
had
been
thrown
down
as
fast
as
erected
national
guards
thronged
the
thoroughfares
the
people
swarmed
along
the
boulevards
in
the
neighborhood
of
the

rose
as
if
by
magic
but
were
as
if
by
magic
swept
away
cavalry
bivouacked
in
the
streets
and
ordnance
was
leveled
along
their
entire
extent
the
avenues
were
closely
invested
and
even
old
men
and
women
were
arrested
on
their
way
to
their
own
thresholds
from
time
to
time
single
shots
or
volleys
of
musketry
were
heard
in
the
distance
and
wounded
men
were
carried
past
to
the
hospitals
the
government
had
ordered
all
public
carriages
to
be
cleared
from
the
stands
that
material
for
new
barricades
might
not
exist
when
the
old
ones
were
demolished
but
the
people
were
busy
too
for
the
iron
railings
at
the
hôtel
of
the
minister
of
marine
in
the
place
de

and
at

the
real
defenders
of

these
were
the

intermingled
with
the
choruses
of
national
songs
that
now
rose
from
the
people
and
the
national
guard
at
twelve
the
legion

declared
to
the
duke

that
he
could
not
answer
for

at
one
accompanied
by
an
immense
multitude
with
whom
they
fraternized
they
were
again
on
the

united

turned
back
to
his
men
and
vociferated
in
tones
of
thunder
wheel
forward
and
the
whole
body
resumed
its
march
down
the
boulevard
an
hour
afterwards
a
still
larger
body
of
troops
municipal
guards
mounted
and
on
foot
cuirassiers
and
infantry
of
the
line
came
down
the
boulevard
and
made
a
half
movement
on
the
rue
lepelletier
but
seeing
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
national
guard
continued
their
march
amid
shouts
of
vive
la
réforme
vive
la
garde
nationale
vive
la
ligne
twice
within
an
hour
afterwards
the
same
thing
occurred
it
was
plain
that
the
national
guard
fraternized
with
the
people
the
legion
deputed
their
colonel
besson
to
demand
of
the
king
reform
and
a
change
of

the

manner

the
municipal

was
ordered
to
disarm
the
legion
both
advanced
bayonets
were
crossed
blood
was
about
to
flow
at
that
moment
textorix
of
the
national
guard
rushed
up
and
exclaimed
brothers
will
you
slay
brothers
the
effect
was
electrical
the
muskets
were
instantly
shouldered
and
the
combatants
separated
all
over
paris
the
same
scenes
took
place
with
a
few
exceptions
vive

cried
ledru
rollin
to
albert
who
was
hurrying
down
the
rue
lepelletier
at
about
noon
vive

was
the
hearty
response
what
of
the
national
guard
the
guard
fraternizes
with
the
people
replied
ledru
rollin
what
of
the
blouses
and
the
barricades
last
night
the
barricades
of
yesterday
were
swept
from
the
streets
and
even
the
material
of
which
to
build
them
also
the
pavements
only
excepted
yet
at
dawn
this
morning
the
whole
space
between
the
quartier
des
champs
the
mont
de
piété
and
the
temple
and
all
the
smaller
streets
were
choked
with
barricades
and
they
were
at
once
assailed
by
the
troops
of
the
line
the
municipal
guard
and
the
chasseurs
of
vincennes
who
were
repulsed
with
most
obstinate
bravery
at
the
rue
rambuteau
the
regiment

three
times
driven
back
also
at
the
corner
of
the
rue

then
through
the
head
of
a
voltigeur
behind

the
attack
on
the
barricade
of
the
rue
rambuteau
a
blouse
pointed
a
pistol
at
an
officer
of
the
municipal
guard
the
pistol
hung
fire
and
the
officer
passed
his
sword
through
his
assailant
body
from
this
you
can
infer
that
we
have
had
close
fighting
i
have
heard
that
an
assault
was
made
on
the
armory
of
our
friends
the

to
liberate
some
of
the
people
who
had
been
arrested
they
stopped
at
the
office
of

and
were
eloquently
addressed
by
our
friend
louis
blanc
what
did
he
say
to
them
he
told
them
the
fight
was
not
yet
over
that

time

louis

office
of

without
fail
at
midnight
it
was
on
the
square
at
the
south
end
of
the
palais
royal
that
most
blood
was
spilled
between
the
people
and
the
troops
the
château
was
furiously
assailed
and
obstinately
defended
assailed
by
the
people
and
defended
by
six
thousand

waited
on
the
king
and
informed
him
that
the
national
guard
demanded
reform
and
the
municipal
guard
a
change
of
ministry
the
king
in
dismay
convened
the
ministry
can
the
ministry
maintain
itself
asked
louis
philippe
that
question
brings
its
own
answer
to
your
majesty
replied
guizot
if
you
doubt
the
stability
of
your
ministry
who
can
trust
them
i
have
thought
of
the
count
mole
observed
the
king
he
is
an
able
man
sire
replied
guizot
and
his
political
connections
with
barrot
and
thiers
may
aid
him
to
form
a
ministry
but
sire
not
an
instant
is
to
be
lost
your
faithful
ministers
will
do
all
they
can
but
a
ministerial
crisis
can
not
be
delayed
and
if
your
majesty
will
permit
the
suggestion
the
emergency
demands
that
to
marshal
bugeaud
be
given
the
command
of
paris
you
will
proceed
to
the
chamber
to
announce
that
mole
is
entrusted
with
the
formation
of
a
new
cabinet
said
the
king
and
the
council
closed
at
four
an
officer
of
the
staff
passed
along
the
boulevards
announcing
the
fall
of
the
ministry
instantly
with
the
speed
of
the
telegraph
the
intelligence
flew
to
the
obscurest
parts
of
paris
its
effect
was
at
first
most
cheering
barricades
were
deserted
and
arms
thrown
down
faces
brightened
hands
almost
stained
with
each
other
blood
were
clasped
troops
and
people
unwillingly
fighting
embraced
all
was
triumph
joy
and
congratulation
all
now
is
over
all
is
right
at
last
was
the
exclamation
of
one
man
of
the
people
to
another
guizot
has
fallen
but
the
king
has
sent
for
count
mole
replied
a
third
with
a
dissatisfied
air
no
matter
cried
the
first
speaker
the
system
is
overturned
what
care
we
who
is
minister
it
is
too
late
replied
the
other
guizot
has
been
forced
away
by
the
people
mole
may
be
forced
away
too
so
may
the
king
no
more
tricks
the
people
now
know
their
power
there
shall
be
no
mistake
this
time
and
the
insurrectionists
parted
as
the
day
closed
barricades
rose
in
the
quartier
du
temple
and
there
was
fighting
between
the
people
and
the
municipal
guard
but
the
national
guard
came
to
the
rescue
and
the
latter
surrendered
at
nine
paris
was
illuminated
white

blue
yellow
orange
green
these
were
the
of
the
lamps
that
poured
their
rich
effulgence
from
every
window
on
the
gloomy
scene
without
the
streets
were
thronged
and
the
cafés
crowded
men
of
all
nations
and
parisians
of
all
classes
were
in
the
streets
the
rattle
of
musketry
had
ceased
the
troops
were
in
their
barracks
and
the
people
at
their
homes
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
des
capucines
flocon
and
louis
blanc
met
guizot
has
fallen
cried
the
first
and
the
most
intimate
friend
of
the
king
has
succeeded
him
what
have
we
to
hope
for
from
the
change
what
are
we
to
do
asked
flocon
in
one
hour
the
people
will
sing
the
marseillaise
before
the
hôtel
des
affaires
étrangères
the
regiment
of
the
line
is
there
replied
flocon
so
much
the
better
blood
will
flow
the
revolution
will
not
stop
and
the
conspirators
separated
at
ten
before
the
official
residence
of
guizot
himself
then
absent
and
probably
in
full
flight
for
the
coast
an
immense
crowd
of
the
people
with
torches
was
assembled
their
purpose
was
to
sing
the
marseillaise
the
regiment
barred
the
way
the
street
was
dimly
lighted
a
single
row
of
lamps
along
the
courtyard
wall
was
all
the
illumination
a
double
line
of
troops
was
the
defence
let
me
pass
cried
the
officer
of
the
national
guard
who
led
the
people
to
the
officer
who
led
the
troops
impossible
in
the
name
of
the
people
i
demand
to
pass
in
the
name
of
the
law
you
shall
not
the
people
command
forward
cried
the
national
guard
present
fire
shouted
the
officer
there
was
a
roll
of
musketry
a
shrill
shriek
rang
along
the
boulevard
the
vast
mass
recoiled
the
smoke
floated
off
of
the
people
of
paris
lay
weltering
in
their
gore
the
blow
is
struck
at
last
cried
dantès
rushing
across
the
boulevard
pale
and
excited
to
arms
people
of
paris
to
arms
to
arms
to
arms
vengeance
for
our
brothers
was
now
the
terrible
cry
that
burst
from
the
infuriated
populace
the
congratulation
the
illumination
all
was
lost
in
the
wild
wish
for
vengeance
at
eleven
that
night
an
immense
multitude
composed
chiefly
of
workmen
from
the
faubourgs
was
coming
down
the
boulevard
des
capucines
it
was
the
largest
and
most
regular
throng
yet
seen
in
front
marched
a
platoon
of
men
bearing
torches
and
waving
flags
immediately
behind
walked
an
officer
in
the
full
uniform
of
the
national
guard
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
whose
slightest
command
was
implicitly
observed
next
came
a
tumbrel
bearing
the
naked
corpses
of
the
slain
whose
faces
mutilated
by
their
wounds
and
disfigured
by
blood
glared
horribly
up
with
open
eyes
in
the
red
torchlight
that
flared
in
the
night
blast
around
behind
this
awful
display
marched
a
dense
mass
of
national
guards
succeeded
by
a
countless
mass
of
the
people
armed
with
guns
swords
clubs
and
bars
of
iron
chanting
forth
in
full
chorus
not
the
inspiring
marseillaise
or
the
parisienne
but
in
awful
concert
sending
upon
the
night
air
the
deep
and
dreadful
notes
of
the
of
the
girondins
mourir
pour
la
patrie
intermingled
with
yells
for
vengeance
down
the
boulevards
approach
the
multitude
more
distinct
becomes
the
dirge
more
redly
glare
the
torches
and
amid
all
more
deeply
rumble
the
wheels
of
the
on
the
pavement
the
funeral
column
reaches
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
lepelletier
the
rises
to
a
yell
of
fury
the
officer
of
the
national
guard
turns
the
head
of
the
column
to
the
right
before
it
is
an
edifice
conspicuous
by
its
illumination
of
huge
and
lamps
it
is
the
office
of
le
national
the
crowd
halts
one
long
loud
shriek
of
vengeance
goes
up
it
is
succeeded
by
the
thrilling
notes
of
the
marseillaise
from
ten
thousands
lips
and
marrast
marrast
is
the
shout
that
follows
the
windows
of
the
front
office
were
thrown
up
and
the
editor
surrounded
by
friends
appeared
his
speech
was
brief
but
fervid
he
exhorted
the
people
to
be
firm
to
secure
their
rights
beyond
recall
and
promised
them
ample
retribution
for
past
wrongs
and
security
for
future
rights
garnier
pages
who
stood
at
the
side
of

next
addressed
the
people
in
the
same
strain
amid
thunders
of
applause
making
a
detour
to
the
office
of
la
réforme
the
multitude
were
addressed
by
flocon
its
editor
then
proceeding
to
the
place
de
la
bastille
the
corpses
were
deposited
at
the
foot
of
the
column
of
july
and
the
crowd
dispersed
the
night
that
succeeded
was
an
awful
one
the
streets
which
an
hour
before
blazed
with
the
illumination
were
dark
barricades
rose
in
every
direction
at
every
corner
shopmen
workmen
women
clerks
and
children
were
at
work
the
crash
of
falling
trees
the
clank
of
the
lever
and
the
pickaxe
the
rattle
of
paving
stones
these
were
the
significant
sounds
that
broke
the
stillness
every
tree
on
the
whole
line
of
the
boulevard
was
felled
and
every
overthrown
a
barricade
of
immense
strength
rose
at
the
end
of
the
rue
richelieu
the
troops
offered
no
resistance
they
piled
their
arms
lighted
their
fires
and
bivouacked
close
beside
the
barricades
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
troops
of
the
line
and
the
chasseurs

chapter

another
midnight
conclave
again
it
was
midnight
again
the
chiefs
of
the
revolution
of
assembled
in
conclave
the
second
of
the
three
days
had
passed
but
the
streets
of
paris
were
all
alive
with
excitement
every
leader
of
the
reform
was
there
ledru
rollin
and
flocon
excited
and
fiery
louis
blanc
exhausted
and
agitated
albert
stern
and
collected
lamartine
pale
and
troubled
marrast
sanguine
and
confident
all
of
them
more
or
less
disturbed
but
dantès
as
for
him
the
same
calm
smile
was
on
his
lip
the
same
mild
light
in
his
eye
and
the
same
unchanging
resolution
upon
his
countenance
who
attended
the
chamber
of
deputies
asked
marrast
did
you
lamartine
i
did
was
the
reply
and
witnessed
a
somewhat
stormy
sitting
at
three
as
usual
old
sauzet
took
the
chair
our
friends
were
there
in
large
numbers
the
ministerial
benches
were
also
filled
immediately
after
guizot
entered
he
had
been
saluted
with
groans
by
the
legion
stationed
on
guard
without
and
with
cries
of
with
guizot
calm
undisturbed
stony
in
aspect
though
strangely
pallid
he
entered
and
took
his
seat
vavin
deputy
for
the
seine
instantly
mounted
the
tribune
as
deputy
of
paris
he
had
he
said
a
solemn
duty
to
fulfill
for
hours
paris
had
been
in
insurrection
why
was
this
he
called
on
the
minister
of
the
interior
to
explain
and
what
said
guizot
asked
louis
blanc
eagerly
he
said
he
thought
the
public
interest
did
not
demand
nor
was
it
proper
for
the
chamber
at
that
time
to
enter
into
debate
on
the
subject
the
king
had
called
le
comte
mole
to
form
a
new
cabinet
and
then
the
left
cheered
exclaimed
flocon
most
emphatically
was
the
reply
and
what
said
guizot
then
asked
ledru
rollin
he
calmly
said
that
no
such
demonstrations
could
induce
him
to
add
to
or
withhold
a
single
syllable
of
what
he
designed
to
say
or
to
pretermit
a
single
act
he
had
designed
to
do
as
long
as
his
ministry
remained
in
office
he
should
cause
public
order
to
be
respected
according
to
his
best
judgment
and
as
he
had
always
done
he
should
consider
himself
answerable
for
all
that
might
happen
and
should
in
all
things
act
as
conscience
might
dictate
for
the
best
interests
of
the
country
a
noble
answer
exclaimed
dantès
with
enthusiasm
ledru
rollin
and
louis
blanc
assented
and
what
next
pursued
flocon
after
considerable
confusion
continued
lamartine
odillon
barrot
rose
and
demanded
in
consequence
of
the
situation
of
the
cabinet
a
postponement
of
the
proposition
for
its
impeachment
fixed
for
ah
and
what
said
the
chamber
asked
flocon
the
demand
was
so
loudly
reprobated
that
barrot
immediately
said
he
made
the
proposal
in
entire
submission
to
the
majority
and
what
said
dupin
asked
ledru
rollin
eagerly
dupin
said
the
first
thing
necessary
for
the
capital
was
order
anarchy
must
cease
the
ministry
could
not
at
the
same
time
occupy
themselves
in
order
and
in
caring
for
their
own
safety
he
demanded
the
adjournment
of
the
impeachment
and
of
all
business
and
what
did
barrot
reply
to
that
asked
louis
blanc
barrot
was
silent
but
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
at
once
rose
and
said
with
much
energy
that
as
long
as
his
cabinet
remained
entrusted
with
the
public
interest
which
would
probably
be
for
some
hours
it
would
cause
the
laws
to
be
respected
the
cabinet
saw
no
reason
for
the
suspension
of
the
labors
of
the
chamber
the
crown
was
at
that
moment
exercising
its
prerogative
and
it
must
be
respected
so
long
as
his
cabinet
was
on
those
benches
the
chamber
need
not
suspend
its
labors
what
was
the
vote
on
the
question
to
postpone
consideration
of
the
impeachment
asked
flocon
some
of
the
opposition
supported
the
motion
but
the
whole
centre
opposed
it
and
it
was
lost
the
chamber
immediately
rose
in
great
agitation
and
guizot
disappeared
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
of
odillon
barrot
is
a
somewhat
peculiar
one
at
this
moment
observed
louis
blanc
he
is
neither
with
the
crown
nor
with
the
people
and
yet
both
seem
to
confide
in
him
as
i
passed
his
house
this
evening
at
about
eight
said
flocon
a
large
multitude
were
in
his
courtyard
shouting
live
odillon
barrot
a
deputation
of
the
people
penetrated
i
understand
even
to
his
private
apartment
where
he
was
in
consultation
with
thiers
and
dupin
barrot
then
urged
them
to
be
moderate
in
their
triumph
and
to
retire
garnier
pages
who
chanced
to
be
there
urged
them
to
do
the
same
and
they
went
off
shouting
louder
than
ever
at
that
moment
one
of
the
reporters
of
le
national
hastily
entered
and
handed
marrast
a
note
whence
do
you
come
monsieur
asked
the
editor
from
the
tuileries
monsieur
was
the
reply
and
the
reporter
left
the
editor
opened
the
note
and
read
aloud
one
count
mole
unable
to
form
a
cabinet
has
this
moment
resigned
and
the
king
has
sent
for
guizot
thiers
and

tyburce
sebastiani
has
just
been
signed
by
guizot
and
his
colleagues
the
ministers
of

and
the
interior
and
will
appear
in
the
of
this
morning
bugeaud
plan
is
this
instant
attack
with
an
overwhelming
force
of
artillery
cavalry
and
infantry
of
the
line
which
he
asserts
he
has
now
all
ready
in
position
in
anticipation
of
this
event
and
well
disposed
to
act
on
all
the
barricades
he
promises
to
sweep
away
every
obstruction
from
the
streets
before
dawn
though
at
the
cost
of
fifty
thousand
lives
ha
exclaimed
all
the
conspirators
instantly
springing
to
their
feet
this
indeed
is
resistance
said
dantès
but
bugeaud
can
concentrate
no
more
troops
upon
us
every
avenue
to
paris
will
be
effectually
closed
before
morning
and
even
the
telegraph
stopped
if
this
be
true
we
have
not
an
instant
to
lose
said
louis
blanc
i
had
a
hint
of
this
began
dantès
stay
stay
messieurs
cried
marrast
as
the
whole
company
was
rushing
to
the
door
here
is
another
and
later
dispatch
two
marshal
bugeaud
has
gone
to
complete
his
arrangements
for
instant
attack
thiers
has
arrived
and
with
odillon
barrot
duvergier
de
hauranne
and
de
remusat
has
formed
a
cabinet
general
lamoricière
supersedes
marshal
bugeaud
the
latter
is
recalled
and
forbidden
to
fire
on
the
people
he
protests
with
violence
and
sheathes
his
sword
in
despair
to
be
sure
he
does
the
old
cried
ledru
rollin
the
idea
of
being
let
loose
with
his
mastiffs
on
the
people
of
paris
like
sheep
pent
up
in
a
fold
was
to
him
a
source
of
rapturous
anticipation
and
his
rage
at
the
disappointment
is
proportional
messieurs
cried
dantès
this
last
step
of
the
government
was
all
that
we
required
to
insure
our
success
thiers
and
barrot
mistake
if
they
think
there
is
sufficient
magic
in
their
names
to
quell
a
revolution
in
fact
neither
of
them
are
trusted
by
the
people
it
is
too
late
yesterday
this
might
have
been
done
but
now
the
demand
is
not
reform
but
a
republic
not
with
the
ministry
but
with
the
dynasty
the
conspirators
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
dantès
in
amazement
and
doubt
it
was
apparent
they
were
as
yet
unprepared
for
language
so
plain
dantès
is
right
cried
flocon
night
when
we
meet
we
shall
all
admit
it
it
was
now
nearly
three
and
the
republicans
repaired
to
their
homes
for
a
few
hours
sleep
before
the
exciting
scenes
anticipated
for
the
morrow
as
louis
blanc
and
albert
passed
up
the
rue
lepelletier
and
came
opposite
the
hôtel
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
which
but
a
few
hours
before
had
been
the
scene
of
so
much
confusion
and
bloodshed
they
paused
and
looked
around
the
pavement
was
still
dark
and
wet
with
the
gore
of
the
slaughtered
citizens
but
the
whole
street
was
deserted
and
silent
here
and
there
a
solitary
light
might
be
detected
in
the
attic
windows
of
the
immense
hôtel
but
no
other
sign
of
life
or
human
occupation
was
to
be
perceived
true
there
was
an
ominous
sound
of
rising
barricades
in
the
boulevard
beyond
the
crash
of
trees
the
click
of
steel
on
stone
the
lumbering
of
wheels
and
at
intervals
a
distant
shout
but
this
excepted
all
was
as
quiet
in
paris
as
if
the
old
city
had
never
known
of
insurrection
this
spot
will
be
noted
in
the
future
history
of
france
said
louis
blanc
do
you
know
the
exact
facts
of
the
case
albert
there
are
so
many
rumors
that
we
can
with
difficulty
get
near
the
truth
i
was
not
present
when
the
delivered
their
fire
was
the
reply
but
i
learned
from
de
courtais
who
hastened
to
the
spot
that
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
now
in
prison
asserts
that
at
the
moment
of
the
arrival
of
the
crowd
a
ball
from
a
musket
which
accidentally
went
off
broke
the
leg
of
his
horse
and
he
thinking
this
the
signal
for
an
attack
at
once
gave
orders
to
fire
another
story
is
that
one
of
our
young
blouses
blew
out
an
officer
brains
with
a
pistol
many
of
the
troops
must
have
fired
in
the
air
said
louis
blanc
looking
around
him
for
there
were
two
hundred
of
them
in
line
i
understand
and
their
discharge
was
delivered
across
the
whole
breadth
of
the
boulevard
swarming
with
people
it
was
unfortunate
for
guizot
rejoined
albert
with
a
sardonic
smile
that
his
hôtel
should
have
witnessed
such
a
scene
but
fortunate
for
the
cause
nevertheless
replied
louis
blanc
this
last
movement
is
called
the
movement
of
the
journalists
i
understand
if
suspicions
are
always
as
correct
said
albert
there
will
be
fewer
false
ones
i
fancy
louis
blanc
made
no
reply
and
the
friends
walked
on
up
the
boulevard
reconnoitering
every
spot
at
the
rue
du
faubourg
montmartre
they
were
stopped
by
a
barricade
which
was
rapidly
rising
under
the
united
and
vigorous
exertions
of
several
hundred
men
steadily
sternly
and
silently
all
that
night
they
toiled
and
when
the
barricade
was
completed
the
flag
was
planted
on
its
summit
and
a
stood
beside
its
staff
to
defend
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
boulevard
in
the
rue
montmartre
rose
another
barricade
entirely
finished
these
men
are
resolved
said
louis
blanc
desperate
rather
replied
albert
they
have
counted
the
cost
and
prepared
to
go
on
with
the
attempt
they
have
begun
at
all
hazards
it
is
better
to
fight
than
starve
they
think
but
do
you
observe
how
few
of
them
are
armed
asked
louis
blanc
we
have
provided
for
that
deficiency
you
will
see
arms
enough
for
all
replied
albert
barricades
first
arms
afterwards
and
indeed
while
he
was
yet
speaking
a
tumbrel
loaded
with
arms
of
every
description
drove
silently
up
and
each
man
supplied
himself
with
a
weapon
that
suited
his
fancy
in
some
instances
the
taste
exhibited
was
ludicrous
in
the
extreme
there
were
swords
without
scabbards
and
bayonets
without
guns
a
towering
helmet
on
the
head
of
one
man
and
broad
white
leather
on
the
shoulders
of
another
daggers
and
knives
sabres
and
pikes
mingled
in
grotesque
confusion
but
each
individual
was
armed
with
something
and
to
crown
all
a
small
piece
of
ordnance
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
four
stout
men
who
staggered
beneath
its
weight
was
now
brought
up
and
placed
in
battery
from
such
men
what
may
we
not
hope
exclaimed
louis
blanc
but
it
is
near
morning
let
us
proceed
i
stop
here
quietly
said
albert
what
pass
the
night
here
exclaimed
his
companion
the
night
is
nearly
passed
now
replied
albert
with
a
smile
i
will
sleep
a
few
hours
with
my
men
of
the
barricades
and
be
ready
to
help
them
defend
their
work
in
the
morning
you
are
devoted
to
the
cause
albert
said
louis
blanc
warmly
grasping
his
hand
oh
no
more
than
yourself
was
the
reply
we
are
all
devoted
to
it
but
each
in
his
own
way
you
are
an
author
i
am
a
workman
it
is
a
light
thing
for
me
to
pass
a
night
with
only
the
sky
for
a
canopy
it
is
a
light
thing
for
you
to
pass
a
night
in
your
study
a
change
of
positions
would
possibly
kill
us
both
the
friends
grasped
each
other
warmly
by
the
hand
and
parted
the
author
going
to
his
study
and
the
workman
to
his
barricade

the
third

the
next
morning
the
following
placard
attracted
general
attention
citizens
of
paris
orders
have
been
given
to
cease
firing
everywhere
we
have
just
been
charged
by
the
king
to
form
a
new
ministry
the
chamber
will
be
dissolved
and
an
appeal
made
to
the
country

lamoricière
has
been
appointed
commandant
of
the
national
guard
liberty
order
union

odillon
barrot
thiers
such
was
the
placard
which
appeared
at
every
corner
in
paris
on
the
morning
of
thursday
february
at
three
it
had
been
hastily
struck
at
the
offices
of
la
presse
and
le
constitutionnel
and
given
into
the
hands
of
the
at
daylight
it
was
read
by
the
early
passers
and
as
soon
as
read
indignantly
torn
down
with
the
significant
murmur
it
is
too
late
at
eight
a
proclamation
to
the
national
guard
signed
by
lamoricière
and
countersigned
by
odillon
barrot
was
similarly
received
at
nine
the
regiment
of
the
line
fraternized
with
the
national
guard
the
resigned
its
arms
to
the
people
and
the
five
companies
of
compiers
yielded
their
quarters
with
all
their
arms
and
ammunition
at
the
first
summons
at
ten
a
proclamation
was
posted
up
at
the
bourse
signed
by
odillon
barrot
and
thiers
ordering
the
troops
not
only
to
cease
firing
but
to
retire
to
their
quarters
immediately
the
trumpets
sounded
a
retreat
and
the
most
important
positions
hitherto
held
by
the
line
were
yielded
to
the
people
the
men
of
the
barricades
could
now
concentrate
and
advance
magic
there
was
none
in
the
names
of
barrot
and
thiers
to
restrain
them
both
were
viewed
as
deserters
from
their
cause
the
latter
was
openly
insulted
by
the
populace
wherever
he
appeared
and
the
former
though
at
first
respectfully
listened
to
was
at
length
assailed
with
murmurs
of
disapprobation
on
his
way
to
the
tuileries
in
his
editorial
sanctum
sat
our
friend
beauchamp
of
whom
for
some
time
we
have
lost
sight
but
who
has
meanwhile
been
most
industriously
at
work
in
his
paper
le
charivari
in
concert
with
le
national
and
other
larger
sheets
in
forwarding
the
cause
of
reform
and
finally
of
revolution
the
door
opened
and
appeared
farewell
beauchamp
he
exclaimed
i
not
a
moment
to
lose
a
is
at
the
door
farewell
off
cried
the
journalist
in
astonishment
and
whither
and
why
yes
off
for
england
italy
america
anywhere
but
france
exclaimed
the
young
noble
and
why
why
cried
the
indignant
deputy
look
around
you
and
then
ask
what
there
is
left
in
france
for
me
beauchamp
continued
the
young
man
hurriedly
and
in
low
tones
france
will
have
no
king
at
this
hour
mark
the
prophecy
the
national
guard
fraternizes
with
the
populace
the
line
fraternizes
with
the
guard
the
government
is
of
course
paralyzed
all
is
over
six
hours
hence
the
tuileries
will
be
ransacked
by
a
drunken
mob
farewell
one
moment
why
do
you
leave
in
this
way
why
do
you
not
go
to
boulogne
by
the
cars
and
do
you
not
know
you
a
journalist
that
for
three
leagues
around
in
every
direction
every
railway
radiating
from
paris
has
been
torn
up
do
you
not
know
that
every
public
conveyance
even
to
the
mail
diligences
has
been
stopped
and
that
all
the
telegraph
stations
have
been
dismantled
all
to
prevent
the
further
concentration
of
troops
in
paris
by
the
government
i
did
hear
of
this
indeed
said
beauchamp
at
dawn
i
was
at
the
railway
dépôt
having
late
last
night
with
extreme
difficulty
procured
a
passport
and
whom
think
you
among
crowds
of
others
i
encountered
there
you
would
never
guess
and
i
have
time
for
you
to
try
lucien
debray
and
with
him
but
impossible
for
you
to
divine
she
who
was
madame
danglars
wife
of
the
rich
banker
years
ago
well
the
banker
is
dead
and
she
is
immensely
rich
and
i
suppose
lucien
spouse
into
the
bargain
and
where
go
they
oh
to
england
of
course
that
grand
reservoir
of
all
emigrant
royalists
that
asylum
for
all
who
love
kings
but
farewell
farewell
if
i
am
not
off
soon
i
may
have
to
go
without
my
head
and
if
you
are
not
massacred
by
your
detestable
party
i
hope
to
hear
of
you
yet
as
a
cabinet
minister
despite
your
abominable
principles
you
have
my
best
wishes
farewell
and
with
a
hearty
shake
of
beauchamp
hand
the
young
noble
was
off
for
an
atmosphere
more
congenial
to
monarchists
than
was
that
of
paris
nor
was
he
alone
thousands
fled
from
paris
in
like
manner
that
same
day
and
the
only
cry
that
followed
them
was
this
let
them
go
let
them
go
the
streets
of
paris
were
now
choked
with
barricades
not
the
mere
temporary
breastworks
of
the
first
and
second
days
which
a
single
charge
of
heavy
dragoons
would
sweep
away
but
regular
systematic
scientific
structures
erected
apparently
under
the
direction
of
military
engineers
and
calculated
upon
every
principle
of
art
to
insure
resistance
some
of
them
were
of
immense
size
that
for
example
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
richelieu
some
had
from
which
protruded
the
mouths
of
ordnance
in
battery
all
were
surmounted
by
a
flag
or
red
and
all
were
defended
by
desperate
men
some
other
thoroughfares
were
crossed
by
many
barricades
the
rue
martin
for
instance
by
thirty
or
forty
the
troops
assailing
these
structures
were
mowed
down
throughout
the
day
in
a
manner
which
even
their
opponents
deemed
most
merciless
instances
of
individual
bravery
on
both
sides
were
frequent
in
the
rue
mauconseil
a
young
man
exposed
himself
on
the
top
of
the
barricade
time
after
time
firing
with
fatal
aim
and
every
time
a
shower
of
balls
from
the
troops
assailing
whistled
around
him
but
he
stood
untouched
and
at
length
the
officer
ordering
the
troops
to
fire
at
him
no
more
he
retired
at
once
behind
the
breastwork
a
boy
in
the
rue
honoré
mounted
the
barricade
enveloped
in
a
flag
and
dared
the
troops
to
fire
on
their
colors
he
descended
unharmed
an
officer
of
the
line
was
summoned
to
yield
his
sword
he
did
so
but
first
broke
it
in
twain
across
his
knee
the
same
demand
was
made
to
a
lieutenant
of
the
municipal
guard
with
a
musket
at
his
breast
he
was
bidden
also
to
shout
vive
la
république
but
he
only
cried
vive
le
roi
as
the
weapon
was
wrenched
from
his
grasp
yet
he
was
spared
arms
were
demanded
from
every
householder
and
when
given
the
gift
was
endorsed
on
the
door
in
these
words
here
we
were
given
arms
one
man
received
a
sword
splendidly
decorated
with
gems
upon
its
scabbard
and
hilt
i
want
only
the
blade
he
said
tearing
it
away
from
its
ornaments
and
grasping
the
naked
steel
at
ten
odillon
barrot
general
lamoricière
and
horace
vernet
the
great
marine
artist
proceeded
on
horseback
to
the
barricades
to
induce
the
people
to
disperse
but
all
their
eloquent
entreaties
were
received
only
with
insults
no
truce
no
tricks
no
mistake
this
time
were
the
decisive
shouts
with
which
they
were
greeted
a
second
time
in
the
rue
richelieu
general
lamoricière
accompanied
by
moline
saint
gru
bearing
a
was
equally
unsuccessful
it
is
too
late
was
the
terrible
response
from
the
heart
of
the
barricades
followed
by
a
shower
of
stones
one
of
which
wounded
general
lamoricière
on
the
hand
a
third
time
in
the
rue
rohan
general
gourgaud
who
even
promised
the
abdication
of
the
king
met
with
the
same
utter
defeat
and
hastily
fled
from
the
fury
of
the
monster
now
thoroughly
roused
at
twelve
the
rumor
sped
with
lightning
rapidity
through
the
streets
of
paris
that
the
troops
who
had
ostensibly
been
ordered
to
their
quarters
were
in
fact
concentrated
around
the
palace
instantly
rose
the
shout
to
the
tuileries
to
the
tuileries
and
a
hundred
thousand
men
from
all
sections
of
the
city
marched
toward
the
palais
bourbon
and
the
tuileries
the
rumor
of
the
concentration
at
the
palace
was
true
the
place
du
carrousel
was
crowded
with
troops
of
every
arm
including
several
squadrons
of
cuirassiers
and
six
pieces
of
ordnance
were
in
position
with
their
ammunition
caissons
and
their
provisions
and
baggage
wagons
as
if
for
a
siege
the
king
attended
by
his
staff
and
accompanied
by
the
dukes
of
nemours
and
montpensier
now
descended
into
the
court
to
pass
the
troops
in
review
the
line
shouted
vive
le
roi
as
the
king
rode
along
the
national
guards
with
tones
and
looks
of
menace
and
defiance
cried
reform
the
king
replied
yes
my
friends
you
shall
have
reform
and
sad
and
dispirited
turned
away
to
his
apartments
as
he
retired
the
bitter
murmur
was
heard
from
his
aged
lips
like
charles
x
a
deputation
of
the
people
had
been
admitted
within
the
limits
of
the
place
du
carrousel
to
announce
the
terms
they
would
accept
but
after
a
brief
parley
had
retired
dissatisfied
the
men
of
the
barricades
now
invested
the
tuileries
and
the
palais
royal
on
every
side
such
was
the
scene
without
within
all
was
confusion
and
dismay
the
salons
were
thronged
by
deputies
peers
generals
and
marshals
bugeaud
lamoricière
dupin
thiers
de
lasteyrie
and
many
others
were
there
together
with
all
of
the
royal
family
then
in
the
capital
whether
male
or
female
meanwhile
the
rattle
of
musketry
broken
by
the
occasional
roar
of
ordnance
in
the
direction
of
the
palais
royal
indicated
the
severe
struggle
then
going
on
between
the
people
and
the
troops
from
time
to
time
the
furious
shout
of
to
the
guillotine
with
louis
philippe
reached
the
ear
does
your
majesty
hear
that
asked
the
duke
of
nemours
coldly
of
his
dismayed
father
alas
the
old
man
was
no
longer
the
hero
of
july
i
do
my
son
was
the
trembling
reply
do
you
advise
abdication
is
there
any
other
course
left
asked
the
duke
of
montpensier
any
other
course
cried
the
queen
indignantly
oh
are
you
my
son
are
you
a
son
of
orléans
and
can
you
talk
thus
of
degradation
are
you
a
soldier
and
do
you
fear
mount
mount
charge
on
the
rebels
cut
them
to
the
earth
drench
the
pavement
with
their
blood
perish
but
yield
not
ignominiously
thus
madame
said
thiers
solemnly
it
is
too
late
there
must
be
an
abdication
in
favor
of
the
count
of
paris
and
the
appointment
of
the
duchess
of
orléans
as
regent
or
all
is
lost
then
if
this
must
be
let
it
be
done
with
dignity
becoming
a
monarch
said
the
noble
queen
let
us
all
retire
to
st
cloud
there
may
be
dictated
terms
of
honorable
capitulation
there
at
that
instant
in
rushed
a
man
breathless
bearing
a
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
exclaiming
sire
sire
your
troops
are
delivering
their
arms
to
the
people
in
a
moment
they
will
stand
where
you
now
stand
sign
this
paper
or
your
life
and
the
lives
of
all
your
family
will
be
sacrificed
that
man
was
émile
de
girardin
the
editor
of
la
presse
and
the
murderer
of
armand
carrel
and
that
paper
was
an
act
of
abdication
ah
this
is
a
bitter
cup
said
the
old
king
as
he
placed
his
signature
to
the
sheet
and
doubly
bitter
presented
by
such
a
hand
like
charles
at
one
at
the
bourse
and
at
the
corners
of
all
the
principal
streets
was
posted
this
proclamation
citizens
of
paris
the
king
has
abdicated
in
favor
of
the
count
of
paris
with
the
duchess
of
orléans
as
regent
a
general

dissolution
of
the
chamber
appeal
to
the
country
but
the
people
were
now
in
the
midst
of
the
assault
on
the
palais
royal
and
to
check
them
was
impossible
the
palais
royal
consisted
of
two
portions
the
château
or
palace
and
the
other
part
which
though
the
property
of
the
orléans
family
was
yet
rented
by
private
persons
and
was
occupied
for
cafés
shops
dwellings
and
places
of
entertainment
adorned
by
colonnades
and
arcades
and
by
trees
statues
and
fountains
in
the
magnificent
quadrangle
the
property
of
the
citizens
was
respected
that
of
the
king
only
was
assailed
for
two
hours
did
the
regiment
pour
forth
its
fire
from
the
numerous
windows
of
that
edifice
and
from
the
court
below
at
length
a
band
of
bold
republicans
headed
by
the
chivalric
étienne
arago
musket
in
hand
charged
from
the
side
of
the
café
de
la
régence
followed
by
a
detachment
of
the
national
guard
and
driving
the
troops
into
the
building
surrounded
it
with
straw
which
they
set
on
fire
the
vast
edifice
was
instantly
filled
with
smoke
and
flame
the
defence
ceased
the
soldiers
rushed
out
and
were
instantly
slain
the
commander
of
the
detachment
was
pierced
by
a
bayonet
the
multitude
rushed
in
and
the
building
was
sacked
the
richest
and
most
costly
furniture
and
decorations
were
at
once
torn
down
dashed
to
pieces
and
thrown
from
the
windows
by
the
infuriated
populace
within
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
is
a
subterranean
passage
constructed
for
the
infant
king
of
rome
and
his
nurses
which
plunging
beneath
the
pavements
and
passing
along
the
whole
length
of
the
gardens
under
the
terrace
beside
the
river
bank
suddenly
emerges
at
the
gate
of
the
place
du
carrousel
in
front
of
the
obelisk
into
this
passage
in
wild
panic
descended
the
king
and
queen
of
france
with
all
their
children
and
grandchildren
immediately
upon
the
signing
of
the
abdication
and
just
as
the
doors
were
about
to
be
forced
emerging
from
the
passage
the
king
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
faithful
wife
marie
amélie
and
followed
by
the
royal
party
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
as
far
as
the
asphalt
pavement
the
royal
party
now
consisted
of
the
king
and
queen
the
duchess
of
nemours
and
her
children
the
princess
clémentine
and
her
husband
the
duke
augustus
of
and
the
duke
of
montpensier
with
his
young
and
lovely
spanish
bride
now
enceinte
and
far
advanced
ignorant
of
the
language
only
sixteen
years
of
age
a
stranger
to
the
customs
and
people
of
the
country
and
in
her
delicate
situation
the
position
of
this
young
creature
was
peculiarly
trying
at
one
moment
she
clung
with
terror
to
her
young
husband
arm
which
she
refused
for
an
instant
to
resign
and
the
next
laughed
at
her
own
terror
saying
that
one
who
in
her
infancy
had
twice
in
madrid
been
saved
by
being
carried
off
in
a
sack
ought
not
now
to
fear
when
she
had
feet
to
carry
herself
away
and
was
suffered
to
use
them
it
is
said
that
the
fair
senora
was
forgotten
in
the
hurry
of
the
flight
and
almost
left
behind
as
soon
as
the
royal
party
were
perceived
they
were
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
national
guards
as
an
escort
and
a
large
number
of
officers
of
the
line
in
various
uniforms
the
king
leaned
on
the
queen
as
if
for
support
while
she
boldly
advanced
with
a
firm
step
and
stern
look
both
were
in
deepest
mourning
for
the
recent
death
of
the
beloved
sister
of
the
king
the
princess
adelaide
upon
this
melancholy
procession
the
people
gazed
with
mingled
curiosity
amusement
gratification
and
regret
they

going
to
the
chamber
of

a

herself
of
her
peculiar
rotundity
as
a
to
force
her
way
through
the
crowd
she
had
better
have
remained
at
home
sneered
a
dynastic
bitterly
the
poor
little
children
exclaimed
a
young
woman
more
remarkable
for
prettiness
than
neatness
and
more
remarkable
still
for
the
scantiness
of
her
attire
nearly
all
of
which
had
been
torn
from
her
rounded
shoulders
in
the
throng
the
spirit
which
pervaded
the
mass
was
evidently
by
no
means
unfriendly
to
the
royal
family
and
it
was
as
evidently
misunderstood
by
them
for
suddenly
as
if
by
fatality
on
the
very
spot
where
louis
xvi
was
beheaded
just
beyond
the
pont
tournant
on
the
pavement
of
the
obelisk
of
luxor
the
whole
party
with
no
apparent
necessity
came
to
a
dead
and
complete
halt
instantly
the
multitude
was
crowded
upon
them
and
this
augmented
their
terror
the
king
dropped
the
queen
arm
and
hastily
raising
his
hat
cried
vive
la
réforme
all
was
in
a
moment
uproar
and
confusion
the
queen
in
terror
at
finding
her
husband
arm
was
gone
turned
hurriedly
on
every
side
fear
not

said
a
mild
voice
beside
her

she
exclaimed
in
great
excitement
evidently
mistaking
the
words
then
regaining
her
husband
she
again
grasped
his
arm
and
the
mass
at
the
same
time
opening
its
ranks
the
two
hastened
on
to
a
couple
of
those
little
black
vehicles
chancing
there
to
stand
which
run
to
st
cloud
in
one
of
these
already
sat
the
duchesses
of
montpensier
and
nemours
with
two
of
the
children
in
the
other
stood
the
two
remaining
children
into
the
latter
hurriedly
stepped
the
royal
pair
the
door
was
instantly
closed
and
the
vehicle
drove
off
at
a
furious
rate
surrounded
by
an
escort
of
dragoons
cuirassiers
and
national
guards
two
hundred
in
number
taking
the
toward
st
cloud
the
other

similarly
escorted
followed
at
a
like
rapid
pace
the
children
standing
at
the
windows
their
faces
pressed
to
the
glass
gazing
eagerly
with
the
innocent
curiosity
of
infancy
on
a
scene
from
which
their
future
fate
would
take
shape
he
is
gone
shouted
a
stentorian
voice
breaking
the
momentary
stillness
as
the
carriages
surrounded
by
their
escort
swept
from
the
view
let

go
let
him
go
was
the
stern
and
significant
response
we

regicides
to
the
tuileries
to
the
tuileries
was
now
the
tremendous
shout
which
rose
from
the
multitude
as
they
rushed
toward
the
deserted
palace
but
the
tuileries
had
already
fallen
it
was
no
longer
the
of

even
before
the

was
declared

the
fraternal
shout

elicited
from
the
lips
of
many
of
the
soldiers
the
answering
cry
of
vive

in
vain
was
it
that

the

at
that

was
their

the
and
legions

the

were
on
the
march
accompanied
by
countless
masses
of

courtyard
were
thousand
of
the
best
troops
in
the
world
of
every
arm
and
a
park
of
ordnance
charged
to
the
muzzle
frowned
upon
the
dense
masses
which
swarmed
the
place
du
carrousel
the
watchful
artilleryman
stood
at
his
cannon
breech
with
the
lighted
linstock
in
his
hand
which
he
kept
alive
by
constant
motion
he
awaited
but
a
word
from
the
pale
firm
lips
of
general
lamoricière
and
that
vast
and
magnificent
space
now
swarming
with
life
would
have
been
swept
as
if
by
destruction
besom
death
in
all
its
most
horrid
forms
would
have
been
there
that
pavement
would
have
run
with
gore
the
façades
of
those
splendid
edifices
would
have
been
polluted
with
shreds
and
fragments
of
human
flesh
and
spattered
with
human
blood
yet
dreadful
would
have
been
the
sure
retribution
indiscriminate
massacre
of
all
unfortunate
souls
within
that
royal
palace
would
have
been
inevitable
and
instantaneous
yet
such
a
catastrophe
might
be
precipitated
by
a
single
word
the
avalanche
might
be
started
by
a
single
breath
and
blood
once
shed
paris
would
be
deluged
in
the
name
of
the
people
i

monsieur
said
the

and
on
the
instant
orders
for
the
retreat
were
issued
the
artillery
went
by
the
railing
of
the
palace
and
the

rue
de

their
muskets
shouldered
with
the

at
the
same
moment
the
abdication
of

was
declared
general
lamoricière

resigned
the

there
was
a
tremendous

chapter

the
last
session
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
usual
hour
for
the
opening
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
was
three
but
the
startling
events
of
the
last
two
days
and
especially
of
the
last
two
hours
demanded
that
it
should
be
convened
earlier
at
one
the
president
of
the
chamber
sauzet
took
the
chair
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
all
the
approaches
were
open
save
the
bridges
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
where
strong
detachments
of
cavalry
were
posted
on
guard
within
the
chamber
all
was
solemnity
about
three
hundred
members
were
present
the
opposition
seemed
joyous
and
confident
though
anxious
the
conservative
party
was
troubled
the
ministerial
benches
were
deserted
at
one
the
president
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
a
side
door
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
enter
suddenly
a
bustle
was
heard
in
that
direction
and
the
duchess
of
orléans
in
deep
mourning
attended
by
her
two
sons
and
followed
by
the
dukes
of
montpensier
and
nemours
entered
the
latter
was
received
with
marked
expressions
of
dislike
the
count
of
paris
garbed
in
complete
black
was
conducted
through
the
crowd
to
the
space
in
front
of
the
chair
the
duchess
followed
and
seated
herself
in
a
fauteuil
upon
the
same
spot
on
each
side
of
her
was
one
of
her
sons
and
behind
her
stood
her
brothers
the
dukes
of
nemours
and
montpensier
this
position
was
subsequently
changed
for
one
more
distant
but
otherwise
remained
throughout
relatively
the
same
being
seated
the
duchess
rose
and
bowed
repeatedly
to
the
assembly
at
the
same
moment
an
immense
multitude
of
national
guards
and
the
people
rushed
in
through
the
passages
and
despite
the
shouts
of
the
officers
you
can
not
enter
the
space
beneath
the
tribune
was
instantly
and
densely
thronged
at
the
same
time
the
public
tribunes
were
invaded
by
a
second
body
of
the
people
for
some
minutes
the
greatest
uproar
prevailed
at
length
it
comparatively
ceased
and
in
a
moment
of
quiet
dupin
who
had
accompanied
the
duchess
of

to
the

lamartine
that

the
question
was
put
and
the
duchess
and
her

after
great
hesitation
were
drawn
away
to
a
side
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
at
the
same
moment
a
new
crowd
of

the
sack
of

tuileries
scarcely
had
the
carriages
conveying
the

family
disappeared
on
their
flight
toward
st

when
the
whole
mass
of
the
populace
poured
as
with
one
simultaneous
purpose
into
the
deserted
palace
the
palais
bourbon
had
already
been
sacked
a
like
fate
might
be
supposed
to
await
the
tuileries
but
the
tuileries
belonged
to
france
not
to
the
house
of
orléans
and
a
certain
respect
was
observed
for
everything
but
the
insignia
of
royalty
for
these
was
shown
no
regard
the
throne
itself
of
the
state

became
his
throne
was
torn
from
its
base
and
having
been
hurled
first
in
derision
from
the
windows
into
the
court
was
borne
in
mock
triumph
on
the
shoulders
of
men
who
shouted
that
now
the
throne
was
indeed
supported
by
the
people
to
the
place
de
la
bastille
and
there
consumed
to
ashes
in
the
courtyard
in
the
rue
de

and
on
the
quays
huge

costly
paintings
splendid
works
of

and
the

carriages
glittering
with

the
magnificent
tapestries
of
the
gobelins
were
borne
as
streamers
in
frantic
fury
along
the
boulevards
mischievous
gamins
were
frolicking
about
in
the
long
scarlet
robes
worn
upon
court
occasions
which
they
had
filched
from
the
royal
wardrobe
the
escritoire
of
the
king
the
key
having
been
found
in
a
was
ransacked
and
private
letters
books
and
the
garments
of
ladies
were
strewn
about
the
court
and
gardens
of
the
tuileries
the
cellars
of
the
palace
were
soon
filled
with
the
insurgents
but
they
declared
the
wine
bad
as
it
never
remained
long
enough
in
the
cellars
of
kings
to
get
good
destruction
not
pillage
seemed
the
order
of
the
hour
and
to
guard
against
robbery
the
people
took
upon
themselves
the
arrest
and
punishment
of
offenders
the
walls
bore
the
menace
robbers
shall
die
in
several
instances
the
threat
was
carried
into
immediate
execution
and
bodies
suffered
to
lie
on
the
spot
upon
which
they
had
been
cut
down
bore
on
their
breasts
the
label
thief
in
terrible
warning
sentinels
also
stood
at
the
gates
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
leave
the
palace
without
rigorous
search
in
the
apartments
of
the
duchess
of
orléans
the
table
was
found
spread
for
the
dinner
of
herself
and
her
children
upon
the
table
were
the
little
silver
cups
forks
and
spoons
of
the
young
princes
and
on
the
floor
were
scattered
their
costly
toys
the
latter
were
gathered
carefully
up
by
a
workman
in
a
blouse
and
as
carefully
concealed
in
a
corner
the
former
together
with
all
jewels
and
other
valuables
found
in
the
apartments
of
the
duchess
were
deposited
in
a
on
which
a
workman
seated
himself
as
guard
and
suffered
no
one
to
approach
until
the
aforesaid
valuables
could
be
conveyed
by
a
detachment
of
the
polytechnic
school
to
the
government
treasury
the
story
runs
that
on
the
night
succeeding
the
sack
of
the
tuileries
the
conquerors
chose
a
king
and
queen
and
that
in
the
palace
hall
was
spread
a
banquet
composed
of
the
viands
found
in
the
royal
kitchen
and
the
wines
found
in
the
royal
cellars
the
queen
who
was
a
soubrette
more
noticeable
for
beauty
than
for
cleanliness
of
person
garbed
in
royal
robes
which
she
well
became
and
with
a
coronet
upon
her
stately
brow
was
seated
in
a
chair
of
state
and
received
the
most
extravagant
homage
from
her
willing
subjects
while
groups
of
gamins
in
the
long
crimson
liveries
of
the
royal
household
boisterously
frolicked
before
the
sans
culotte
court
amid
roars
of
merriment
chapter
xxiv
a
memorable
night
generally
the
rogues
throughout
paris
intimidated
by
the
awful
immediate
and
certain
penalty
for
crime
forsook
for
the
time
their
calling
a
man
who
attempted
to
fire
the
palais
royal
was
shot
at
the
préfecture
another
for
a
like
attempt
on
buildings
in
the
rue
monceau
met
a
like
fate
in
the
rue
richelieu
lay
the
bodies
of
two
thieves
each
with
a
ball
through
the
breast
and
over
the
aperture
the
word
thief
on
a
label
in
like
manner
were
eight
more
robbers
executed
at
once
on
the
place
de
la
madeleine
a
woman
of
the
street
wrested
a
bracelet
from
a
lady
wrist
she
was
instantly
seized
by
the
bystanders
and
shot
but
for
this
summary
punishment
of
malefactors
by
the
people
dreadful
that
night
would
have
been
the
state
of
paris
without
laws
to
enforce
or
a
police
to
enforce
them
it
is
true
the
château
of
neuilly
was
sacked
and
burned
as
well
as
the
splendid
villa
of
the
baron
rothschild
at
parennes
but
both
were
supposed
to
be
the
property
of
the
king
it
is
true
also
that
some
rails
on
the
northern
railway
were
torn
up
and
a
viaduct
between
paris
and
amiens
and
another
between
amiens
and
the
frontier
of
belgium
were
demolished
and
that
the
railway
stations
at
denis
enghien
and
pontoise
and
the
bridge
at
asnières
had
been
destroyed
but
all
this
was
done
to
prevent
the
concentration
upon
the
citizens
of
paris
of
additional
royal
troops
a
workman
entered
a
house
and
demanded
bread
meat
and
wine
were
offered
him
no
was
the
reply
bread
and
water
are
all
i
want
yet
such
was
the
scarcity
of
food
that
horses
were
killed
and
eaten
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
on
the
third
day
of
the
revolution
arms
arms
shouted
a
band
of
workmen
entering
a
house
on
the
rue
richelieu
the
proprietor
alarmed
shouted
for
help
do
you
think
us
robbers
was
the
indignant
reply
give
us
your
weapons
the
weapons
were
given
and
the
band
retired
on
the
door
they
wrote
here
we
received
arms
at
five
on
the
evening
of
the
of
february
a
proclamation
to
the
citizens
of
paris
issued
by
the
provisional
government
then
in
session
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
declared
the
revolution
accomplished
that
eighty
thousand
of
the
national
guard
and
one
hundred
thousand
of
the
people
were
in
arms
that
order
as
well
as
liberty
must
now
be
secured
and
the
people
with
the
national
guard
were
appointed
guardians
of
paris
the
effect
of
this
proclamation
was
magical
never
was
paris
so
well
protected
as
on
that
night
of
the
of
february
when
filled
with
barricades
she
had
no
police
and
was
guarded
by
her
citizens
and
how
was
constituted
the
provisional
government
whose
power
was
thus
implicitly
obeyed
it
was
founded
by
the
people
who
obeyed
it
this
was
the
only
secret
from
the
chamber
of
deputies
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
proceeded
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
they
marched
under
a
canopy
of
sabres
pikes
and
bayonets
into
halls
stained
with
blood
and
encumbered
with
the
slain
and
there
at
a
small
table
while
the
conflict
between
the
two
republics
had
already
commenced
within
an
hour
had
they
organized
their
body
by
the
nomination
of
armand

of
le

ferdinand
flocon
of
la
réforme
albert
a
workman
and
louis
blanc
the
editor
and
author
as
secretaries
of
the
government
their
first
official
act
was
to
issue
a
proclamation
to
the
people
the
scenes
witnessed
the
night
which
succeeded
in
paris
will
never
be
forgotten
by
those
who
witnessed
them
patrols
promenaded
the
streets
the
men
of
the
barricades
slept
upon
their
weapons
beside
their
works
and
through
all
that
night
ceaselessly
toiled
the
press
to
spread
over
all
the
world
the
news
of
the
great
events
of
the
three
past
days
in
paris
upon
the
door
of
an
edifice
situated
in
the
rue
jean
jacques
rousseau
a
street
which
was
filled
with
barricades
of
immense
size
and
strength
was
posted
a
printed
placard
the
provisional
government
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
entering
the
door
with
a
vast
multitude
and
ascending
the
dark
and
winding
staircase
you
found
yourself
in
a
large
room
dimly
lighted
and
crowded
with
armed
men
it
was
the
editorial
apartment
of
the
office
of
la
réforme
at
a
large
and
massive
table
sat
a
dozen
persons
most
industriously
employed
in
writing
around
them
looking
on
rose
the
rough
stern
faces
of
the
men
of
the
barricades
seeming
still
more
rough
and
stern
by
reason
of
the
shadowy
light
in
the
hands
of
all
were
weapons
a
copy
of
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
was
the
incessant
demand
of
these
armed
men
a
demand
which
the
dozen
writers
at
the
table
were
unable
even
by
most
indefatigable
industry
to
supply
as
fast
as
made
and
as
fast
as
the
demand
was
satisfied
the
armed
men
would
hurry
away
only
to
leave
room
for
the
crowds
constantly
entering
a
copy
for
the
hôtel
de
ville
cried
one
a
copy
for
the
place
vendôme
shouted
another
a
copy
for
the
palais
bourbon
screamed
a
third
are
there
no
printed
copies
left
asked
many
they
were
gone
long
ago
twenty
thousand
copies
was
the
reply
you
will
see
one
at
every
corner
the
demand
was
not
expected
the
printers
have
just
gone
to
sleep
they
had
not
rested
for
hours
will
réforme
appear
in
the
morning
asked
another
perhaps
so
was
the
answer
but
all
the
people
are
worn
out
writers
and
compositors
here
is
your
copy
of
the
names
many
thanks
vive
la
république
with
this
shout
in
concert
with
the
same
which
constantly
issued
from
a
hundred
lips
the
citizen
folded
up
his
precious
document
and
carefully
depositing
it
in
his
cap
hurried
off
to
communicate
its
contents
to
his
comrades
of
the
neighboring
barricade
in
another
apartment
of
that
same
edifice
were
a
large
number
of
the
republican
party
connected
with
la

the
provisional
government
is
now
in
session
said
one
they
will
doubtless
make
immediate
provision
for
departments
of
state
so
important
as
the
and
the
préfecture

may
be
too
late
interrupted
a
large
and
muscular
man
the
is
more
active
than
ever
every
moment
couriers
are
arriving
and
departing
that
powerful
instrument
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
foes
of
our
cause
who
may
estimate
the
injury
the
irreparable
injury
which
they
may
this
night
accomplish
by
its
means
this
man
was
étienne
arago
brother
of
the
great
astronomer
and
for
sixteen
years
celebrated
as
one
of
the
boldest
members
of
the
republican
party
as
well
as
one
of
the
bravest
men
in
paris
and
the
préfecture
of
police
observed
another
the
present
utter
derangement
of
all
its
functions
may
lead
to
most
serious
results
already
those
foes
of
freedom
guizot
and
his
colleagues
have
been
suffered
to
secure
their
escape
from
the
just
indignation
of
an
outraged
people
delessert
the

has
also
fled

said
this

the
charge
of

this

was
confirmed
by
acclamation
and

into

accompanied
them
to
their
respective

of

surrounded
by

and
its
numerous
windows
were
flashing
with
lights
within
the
utmost
activity
seemed
to
prevail
and
without

leaving
and
arriving

said
étienne

entering
the
private
cabinet
of
the

and
who

my
successor
asked
the
astonished
count
rising
to
his
feet
in

i
am
sent
to

to
succeed

the
answer

pointing
to
the

before

said
the
count
after
some
hesitation
i
must
ask
of
you
for
some
record
of
this
act
bearing
your
signature
to
be
deposited
in
the
archives
of
the
office
certainly
monsieur
your
request
is
but
reasonable
answered
arago
seating
himself
in
the
official
chair
and
writing
a
few
lines
to
which
he
affixed
his
signature
he
coolly
handed
the
document
to
his
astonished
predecessor
it
contained
notice
of
his

he
placed
the
original
on

among
the
papers
of

courteously
bowing
he
took
his
hat

and
marched

the

in

closely
closeted
sat
the
provisional

of

over
that
stern
old
citadel
over
the
dismantled
palace
of
the
tuileries
from
the
tall
summit
of
the
column
of
vendôme
over
the
hôtel
des
invalides
and
in
the
place
de
la
bastille
is
seen
a
banner
streaming
out
like
a
meteor
on
the
keen
blast
eighty
thousand
armed
men
invest
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
wave
on
wave
wave
on
wave
the
living
and
stormy
tide
eddies
and
welters
and
dashes
around
that
dark
old
pile
all
its
avenues
are
held
its
courts
are
thronged
ordnance
frowns
from
its
black
portals
and
against
its
gates
drums

and
from
those

of
hoarse
and

goes
up

one
shout
of

and
command

no

no

down
down
forever
with
the
kings
and
upward
to
that
dark
old
pile
of
despotism
as
to
the
temple
of
liberty
herself
are
turned
those
tens
of
thousands
of
swarthy
faces
dark
with
the
smoke
of
battle
yet
livid
with
excitement
and
exhaustion
and
as
they
realize
that
within
those
walls
the
question
of
their
fate
and
that
of
their
country
is
then
being
settled
that
from
that
night
counsels
in
that
vast
and
ancient
edifice
are
to
flow
peace
and
prosperity
and
freedom
and
plenty
or
else
all
the
untold
terrors
of
anarchy
civil
war
bloodshed
violence
and
strife
what
wonder
that
the
sitting
of
the
council
seemed
endless
and
their
own
impatience
became
intolerable
that
all
imaginable
doubts
and
fears
and
absurd
apprehensions
took
possession
of
their
inflamed
imaginations
that
at
one
time
the
rumor
should
fly
and
win
credence
as
it
flew
that
the
provisional
government
were
consulting
with
the
friends
of
henry
or
again
that
they
were
considering
the
question
of
a
regency
and
that
under
such
influences
they
should
roar
and
yell
and
thunder
for
admission
at
the
gates
and
burden
the
air
with
their
shouts
no
bourbons
no
kings
no
regency
death
death

la

at
times
in
terrific
concert
would
the
thousands
of
uplifted
throats
roar
forth
the
chorus
of
that
startling
canticle
of
vive

then
the
song
would
change
and
the
mournful
notes
of
the
death
hymn
of
the
girondins
mourir
pour
la
patrie
would
swell
in
wild
yet
solemn
cadence
on
the
wintry
blast
death
hymn
of
the

by
the
voice
of

and
thus
all
that
terrible
night
even
until
the
morning
dawn
thronged
those
men
of
the
barricades
around
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
all
the
night
even
until
the
morning
dawn
calmly
continued
those
men
of
the
provisional
government
of
the
french
republic
amid
menace
and
mandate
uproar
and
confusion
in
their
noble
yet
arduous
work
at
midnight
a
proclamation
of
the
provisional
government
was
read
by
torchlight
to
the
excited
masses
by
louis
blanc
from
the
steps
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
declaring
for
a
government
of
the
people
by
itself
with
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
for
its
principles
while
order
was
devised
and
maintained
by
the
people
which
served
somewhat
to
allay
their
apprehensions
and
distrust
this
proclamation
appeared
in
all
the
morning
journals
and
was
placarded
all
over
the
city
the
next
day
that
day
was
friday
the
of
february
but
still
the
provisional
government
remained
in

rushed
into

furious
cries

with
threats

were
well
nigh
accomplished
again

again
at

his
colleagues

the
brave
the
eloquent
the
wise
lamartine
present
himself
upon
the
steps
of
the
hôtel

assuage
and
quiet
the
rising
tempest

again
throughout
that
fearful
day
did
he
come
forth
to
wrestle
with
violence
turbulence
anarchy
and
strife
and
again
and
again
beneath
the
magic
of
his
eloquent
tongue
the
storm
lulled
the
tempest
ceased
again
and
again
throughout
all
that
fearful
day

hours

hour

in

after

hour
of
four
in

the

when
the
people
of
paris
consented
to
retire
to

homes
but
during
all
of
this
period
night
and
day
without
intermission
every
moment
was
the
hôtel
de
ville
surrounded
by
tumultuous
masses
infuriated
by
suspicion
apprehension
and
distrust
for
two
whole
days
and
two
whole
nights
armed
men
incessantly
inundated
the
square
the
courts
and
halls
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
they
insisted
on
giving
to
the
republic
the
character
the
attitude
and
the
emblems
of
the
first
revolution
they
insisted
on
a
republic
violent
sweeping
dictatorial
and
terrorist
in
language
in
gesture
and
in
color
in
place
of
that
determined
on
moderate
pacific
legal
unanimous
and
constitutional
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
the
provisional
government
resisted
this
demand
twenty
times
during
those
hours
was
lamartine
taken
up
dragged
carried
to
the
doors
and
windows
or
to
the
head
of
the
grand
staircase
into
the
courts
and
the
square
to
hurl
down
with
his
eloquence
those
emblems
of
terrorism
with
which
it
was
attempted
to
dishonor
the
republic
but
the
vast
and
infuriated
mass
refused
to
listen
and
drowned
his
voice
in
clamor
and
vociferation
at
length
when
exhausted
in
defence
of
the
emblem
of
a
moderate
republic
he
exclaimed
the
red
flag
has
been
nowhere
except
around
the
trailed
in
the
blood
of
the
people
while
the
has
been
around
the
world
with
our
navy
our
glory
and
our
liberties
the
furious
and
hitherto
obdurate
and
bloodthirsty
populace
became
softened
tears
were
shed
arms
were
lowered
flags
were
thrown
away
and
peaceably
they
departed
to
their
homes
never
never
was
there
a
more
glorious
triumph
of
eloquence
of
patriotism
it
was
on
the
morning
of
sunday
the
day
of
february
that
the
provisional
government
deemed
it
prudent
and
proper
for
them
to
bring
to
a
close
their
initiative
labors
and
once
more
for
the
last
time
lamartine
descended
the
steps
of
the
great
staircase
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
presenting
himself
in
front
of
the
edifice
surrounded
by
his
colleagues
announced
to
the
vast
assembly
the
result
of
their
protracted
toil
royalty
abolished
a
republic
proclaimed
the
people
restored
to
their
political
rights
national
workshops
opened
the
army
and
national
guard
reorganized
the
abolition
of
death
for
political
offences
with
louder
and
more
prolonged
acclamations
than
any
other
decree
was
this
last
received
and
instantly
in
accordance
with
this
proclamation
the
director
of
criminal
affairs
on
the
order
of
crémieux
minister
of
justice
dispatched
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
all
over
france
the
warrant
to
suspend
all
capital
executions
which
were
to
have
taken
place
in
virtue
of
royal
decrees
until
the
will
of
the
national
assembly
at
once
to
be
convened
should
be
promulgated
on
the
subject
of
the
penalty
of
death
the
effects
of
this
decree
as
it
sped
on
the
lightning
wings
like
a
saving
angel
all
over
france
may
be
imagined
perhaps
but
portrayal
is
impossible
who
can
imagine
even
the
joy
the
rapture
it
brought
to
many
a
who
was
counting
the
hours
that
yet
remained
to
him
of
life
and
preceded
his
awful
doom
or
to
those
who
sorrowed
over
his
untimely
perchance
his
unjust
fate
leaning
on
the
arm
of

the
youngest

of
the
government
the
venerable
dupont

by

appeared
on
the
balcony
of
the
room
formerly
called
the
chamber
of
the
throne
but
now
the
chamber
of
the
republic
lamartine
then
advanced
a
step
before
his
colleagues
and
in
a
brief
and
eloquent
address
proclaimed
to
that
immense
throng
the
existence
of
the
republic
the
announcement
was
received
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
shouts
of
vive

mingled
with
those
of

loudly
rose
from
the
hôtel
de

the
provisional
government
proceeded
in
a
body
despite
the
rain
which
fell
in
torrents
accompanied
by
the
people
to
the
place
de
la
bastille
there
officially
to
inaugurate
the
republic
agreeably
to
announcement
at
the
appointed
hour
the
place
de
la
bastille
was
thronged
the
national
guard
consisting
of
two
battalions
from
each
of
the
twelve
legions
of
paris
together
with
the
thirteenth
legion
of
cavalry
and
two
battalions
of
the
banlieu
were
drawn
up
from
the
church
of
the
madeleine
to
the
column
of
july
and
there
at
the
base
of
that
column
erected
in
commemoration
of
the
revolution
which
had
made
louis
philippe
king
of
the
french
his
downfall
was
commemorated
and
on
the
ruins
of
the
throne
then
established
was
now
inaugurated
a
republic
during
the
ceremony
of
the
inauguration
the
marseillaise
was
sung
by
the
national
guard
and
the
people
and
at
its
conclusion
about
the
hour
of
three
the
troops
filed
off
before
the
column
of
july
to
the
thrilling
strains
of
the
marseillaise
and
the
mourir
pour
la
patrie
of
the
girondins
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
preceded
by
a
detachment
of
the
national
guard
and
accompanied
by
the
pupils
of
the
polytechnic
school
and
the
military
school
of
cyr
then
descended
the
boulevards
followed
by
the
whole
of
the
military
and
civic
array
who
chanted
the
national
songs
the
effect
was
stupendous
hour
after
hour
the
immense
procession
moved
on
like
a
huge
serpent
through
the
streets
of
paris
and
at
length
when
its
head
was
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
its
extremity
had
hardly
left
the
column
of
july
it
was
night
on
sunday
the
of
february
when
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
for
the
first
time
during
four
days
returned
to
their
homes
but
their
work
was
accomplished
a
republic
was
gained
proclaimed
and
inaugurated
chapter
xxvi
dantès
and
mercédès
it
was
a
tempestuous
night
the
wind
howled
dismally
through
the
streets
of
paris
and
the
rain
and
sleet
dashed
fiercely
against
the
casements
at
intervals
a
wild
shout
might
be
caught
as
the
blast
paused
in
its
furious
career
and
then
a
distant
shot
might
be
heard
but
they
passed
away
and
nothing
save
the
wail
of
the
or
the
rushing
sleet
of
the
winter
tempest
was
distinguished
but
while
all
was
thus
wild
dark
and
tempestuous
without
light
warmth
comfort
and
elegance
rendered
yet
more
delightful
by
the
elemental
war
reigned
triumphant
within
a
large
and
splendidly
furnished
apartment
in
the
noble
mansion
of
dantès
the
deputy
from
marseilles
in
the
rue
du
helder
every
embellishment
which
art
could
invent
luxury
court
wealth
invoke
or
even
imagination
conceive
seemed
there
lavished
with
a
most
prodigal
hand
the
soft
atmosphere
of
summer
perfumed
by
the
exotics
of
a
neighboring
conservatory
delighted
the
senses
the
mild
effulgence
of
gaslight
transmitted
through
opaque
globes
of
glass
melted
upon
the
sight
while
sofas
divans
and
ottomans
in
luxurious
profusion
invited
repose
to
describe
the
rare
paintings
the
rich
gems
of
statuary
and
the
other
miracles
of
art
which
were
there
to
be
seen
would
be
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
to
portray
the
exquisite
taste
which
enhanced
the
value
of
each
and
constituted
more
than
half
its
charm
upon
one
of
the
elegant
sofas
reclined
edmond
dantès
his
tall
and
graceful
figure
draped
in
a
dressing
robe
while
beside
him
on
a
low
ottoman
sat
his
beautiful
wife
her
arm
resting
on
his
knee
and
her
dark
glorious
eyes
gazing
with
confiding
fondness
into
his
face
mercédès
was
no
longer
the
young
and
thoughtless
being
who
graced
the
village
of
the
catalans
many
years
had
flown
since
then
and
many
sorrows
passed
over
her
each
of
these
years
and
each
of
these
sorrows
like
retiring
waves
of
the
sea
upon
the
smooth
and
sandy
beach
had
left
behind
its
trace
no
mercédès
was
not
now
the
young
and
thoughtless
girl
she
once
was
but
she
was
a
being
far
more
perfect
far
more
winning
far
more
to
be
loved
she
was
a
matured
impassioned
accomplished
and
still
despite
the
flight
of
years
most
lovely
woman
she
was
one
who
could
feel
passion
as
well
as
inspire
it
and
having
once
felt
or
inspired
it
that
passion
it
was
plain
could
never
pass
lightly
away
her
face
could
not
now
boast
perhaps
that
full
and
perfect
oval
which
it
formerly
had
but
the
lines
of
care
and
of
reflection
which
here
and
there
almost
imperceptibly
appeared
rendered
it
all
the
more
charming
in
the
bold
yet
beautiful
contour
of
those
features
in
the
full
red
lips
in
the
high
pale
forehead
and
above
all
in
those
dark
and
haunting
eyes
lay
a
depth
of
feeling
and
profundity
and
nobleness
of
thought
which
to
a
reflective
mind
have
a
charm
infinitely
more
irresistible
than
that
which
belongs
to
mere
youthful
perfection
there
was
a
bland
beauty
in
the
smile
which
slept
upon
her
lips
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
in
the
faint
flush
that
tinged
her
soft
cheek
and
a
deep
meaning
in
her
dark
and
eloquent
eye
which
told
a
whole
history
of
experience
even
to
a
stranger
while
the
full
and
rounded
outline
of
the
figure
garbed
in
a
loose
robe
of
crimson
which
contrasted
beautifully
with
her
luxuriant
dark
tresses
had
that
voluptuous
development
and
grace
which
only
maturity
and
maternity
can
impart
to
the
female
form
in
short
never
had
mercédès
in
the
days
of
her
primal
bloom
presented
a
person
so
fascinating
as
now
she
was
a
woman
to
sigh
for
perchance
to
die
for
and
one
whom
a
man
would
willingly
wish
to
live
for
if
he
might
but
hope
she
would
live
for
him
or
peradventure
he
might
even
be
willing
not
only
to
risk
but
ultimately
to
resign
his
life
would
that
fair
being
not
only
live
for
him
but
love
him
with
that
entire
and
passionate
devotedness
which
beamed
from
her
dark
eyes
up
into
his
who
now
gazed
upon
her
as
she
sat
at
his
feet
as
for
him
as
for
edmond
dantès
his
figure
had
now
the
same
elegance
his
hand
the
same
delicate
whiteness
his
features
the
same
spiritual
beauty
his
brow
the
same
marble
pallor
and
his
eye
which
beamed
beneath
its
calm
expanse
the
same
deep
brilliancy
which
years
before
had
distinguished
him
from
all
other
men
and
made
the
count
of
the
idol
of
every
salon
in
paris
and
the
hero
of
every
maiden
dream
yet
that
face
was
not
without
its
changes
tears
care
thought
and
sorrow
had
done
their
work
in
the
deep
lines
upon
his
brow
and
cheek
in
the
silvery
threads
which
thickly
sprinkled
his
hair
and
more
than
all
in
the
mild
light
of
those
eyes
which
once
glowed
only
with
vindictive
hate
or
gratified
revenge
and
in
the
softened
expression
of
those
lips
which
once
in
their
stern
beauty
had
but
curled
with
scorn
or
quivered
with
rage
could
be
read
that
the
lapse
of
time
though
it
might
indeed
have
made
him
a
sadder
man
had
made
him
also
a
better
one
the
husband
and
wife
were
alone
they
still
loved
as
warmly
as
ever
and
if
possible
more
fondly
than
when
first
they
were
made
one
dantès
stretched
himself
out
on
the
sofa
and
mercédès
dropping
lower
upon
the
low
ottoman
at
his
side
passed
her
full
and
beautiful
arm
around
his
waist
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
he
returned
the
embrace
with
warmth
and
placing
his
own
arm
about
her
form
drew
it
closely
to
his
bosom
thus
they
remained
clasped
in
each
other
arms
and
thus
they
fixed
on
each
other
eyes
beaming
with
love
passion
bliss
happiness
unutterable
my
own
edmond
murmured
mercédès
at
length
you
are
again
with
me
all
my
own
am
i
not
always
your
own
dearest
was
the
fond
reply
but
during
the
week
past
i
might
almost
say
during
the
month
past
you
have
been
compelled
to
be
so
often
absent
from
me
ah
love
you
know
i
was
not
willingly
absent
was
the
quick
answer
no
no
no
but
it
was
hardly
the
more
endurable
for
that
said
the
lady
with
a
smile
oh
the
anxiety
of
the
last
three
days
and
nights
dearest
i
do
believe
i
have
not
slept
three
hours
during
the
whole
of
those
three
days
and
nights
and
i
dear
have
slept
not
one
was
the
laughing
rejoinder
but
all
is
over
now
is
it
not
in
one
sense
all
is
over
and
in
another
all
now
begins
the
monarchy
is
ended
in
france
i
believe
forever
the
republic
has
begun
and
i
trust
will
prove
lasting
and
all
the
grand
objects
for
which
you
have
been
striving
with
your
noble
colleagues
for
years
and
years
are
at
length
accomplished
are
they
not
that
is
a
question
love
not
easily
answered
that
the
cause
of
man
and
france
has
wonderfully
triumphed
during
the
past
three
days
is
no
doubt
most
true
but
this
victory
love
i
foresaw
indeed
it
was
but
the
inevitable
result
of
an
irresistible
cause
it
was
neither
chance
love
nor
a
spontaneous
burst
of
patriotism
that
on
the
first
day
filled
the
boulevards
with
fifty
thousand
blouses
which
on
the
second
won
over
to
the
people
eighty
thousand
national
guards
and
on
the
third
choked
the
streets
of
paris
with
barricades
constructed
by
engineers
and
defended
by
men
completely
armed
the
events
of
the
last
three
days
mercédès
have
been
maturing
in
the
womb
of
providence
for
the
past
ten
years
it
is
their
birth
only
which
has
now
taken
place
and
to
some
the
parturition
seems
a
little
premature
i
suppose
this
banquet
caused
the
fright
that
hastened
the
event
added
dantès
laughing
you
are
very
scientific
in
your
comparisons
replied
mercédès
slightly
blushing
and
i
suppose
i
must
admit
very
apt
but
tell
me
love
is
all
over
that
is
must
you
be
away
from
me
any
more
at
night
and
wander
about
heaven
only
knows
where
in
this
dark
and
dangerous
city
or
heaven
only
knows
with
whom
or
for
what
dantès
kissed
his
fair
wife
and
after
a
pause
during
which
he
gazed
fondly
into
her
eyes
replied
i
hope
i
trust
i
believe
dear
that
all
is
over
at
least
all
that
will
take
me
from
you
as
during
the
past
week
france
has
or
will
have
a
republic
that
is
as
certain
as
fate
can
make
it
but
first
she
will
have
to
pass
through
strife
and
tribulation
perhaps
bloodshed
the
end
surely
love
is
not
yet
but
france
is
now
comparatively
free
the
dreadful
problem
is
now
nearer
solution
than
it
ever
was
labor
will
hereafter
be
granted
to
all
together
with
the
adequate
reward
of
labor
destitution
will
not
be
deemed
guilt
the
is
abolished
the
rich
will
not
with
impunity
grind
the
poor
into
powder
beneath
their
heels
asylums
for
the
suffering
the
distressed
the
abandoned
of
both
sexes
will
be
sustained
the
efforts
which
as
individuals
we
have
some
of
us
made
for
years
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
mankind
to
assuage
human
woes
and
augment
human
joys
will
henceforth
be
encouraged
and
directly
aided
by
the
state
this
revolution
love
is
a
social
revolution
and
during
the
hours
the
provisional
government
was
in
session
in
the
hôtel
de
ville
i
became
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
who
with
sleepless
vigilance
watched
their
proceedings
had
learned
the
deep
lesson
too
well
to
be
further
deceived
and
that
the
fruits
of
the
revolution
they
had
won
would
not
again
be
snatched
from
their
lips
and
the
result
of
this
triumph
of
the
people
you
believe
has
advanced
the
cause
of
human
happiness
asked
mercédès
most
unquestionably
dear
and
most
incalculably
too
perhaps
all
your
friends
are
not
as
disinterested
as
you
have
been
edmond
said
mercédès
and
why
think
you
that
dear
for
six
full
years
i
know
you
have
devoted
all
your
powers
of
mind
and
body
and
all
your
immense
wealth
to
one
single
object
and
that
object
has
been
the
happiness
of
your
race
well
dear
and
now
when
a
triumph
has
been
achieved
now
when
others
who
have
been
but
mere
instruments
blind
instruments
many
of
them
in
your
hands
to
accomplish
they
knew
not
what
come
forward
and
assume
place
and
power
you
edmond
the
noble
author
and
first
cause
of
all
remain
quietly
in
seclusion
unknown
unnamed
unappreciated
and
uncommended
while
the
others
reap
the
fruits
of
your
toil
well
dear
said
dantès
smiling
at
the
warmth
of
his
wife
in
his
behalf
but
it
is
not
edmond
i
say
no
one
is
as
disinterested
as
you
ah
love
what
of
ambition
mercédès
smiled
let
me
tell
you
all
love
and
then
you
will
not
i
fear
think
me
disinterested
said
dantès
seriously
i
should
blush
indeed
at
praise
so
little
deserved
you
know
all
my
early
history
i
suffered
i
was
wronged
i
was
revenged
but
was
i
happy
i
sought
happiness
all
men
do
so
even
the
most
miserable
some
seek
happiness
in
gratified
ambition
some
in
gratified
avarice
some
in
gratified
vanity
and
some
in
the
gratification
of
a
dominant
lust
for
pleasure
or
for
power
i
sought
happiness
in
gratified
revenge
mercédès
shuddered
and
hiding
her
face
on
the
bosom
of
her
husband
clung
to
it
more
closely
as
if
for
protection
dantès
drew
her
form
to
his
as
he
would
have
drawn
that
of
a
child
and
continued
i
sought
happiness
in
vengeance
for
terrible
wrongs
and
to
win
it
i
devoted
a
life
and
countless
wealth
what
was
the
result
misery
misery
misery
poor
edmond
murmured
mercédès
clinging
to
him
closer
than
ever
at
length
i
awoke
as
from
a
dream
i
saw
my
error
my
whole
life
had
been
a
lie
i
saw
that
god
by
a
miracle
had
bestowed
on
me
untold
riches
for
a
nobler
purpose
than
to
make
his
creatures
wretched
i
saw
that
if
i
would
be
happy
i
must
make
others
happy
and
to
this
end
the
happiness
not
the
misery
of
my
race
must
my
wealth
and
power
be
devoted
to
this
end
then
did
i
devote
myself
and
to
this
end
for
six
years
have
i
been
devoted
to
make
myself
happy
by
making
others
happy
you
among
the
rest
dear
dear
mercédès
he
added
pressing
her
to
his
bosom
and
am
i
then
so
disinterested
but
why
should
you
achieve
triumphs
for
others
to
enjoy
edmond
asked
the
wife
you
refer
to
the
provisional
government
said
dantès
with
a
smile
well
i
see
i
must
tell
you
all
even
though
by
the
revelation
i
prove
myself
utterly
unworthy
of
the
praise
of
disinterestedness
i
may
tell
you
love
you
my
second
self
without
danger
of
being
charged
with
egotism
what
i
might
not
say
to
others
our
friend
lamartine
is
the
actual
head
of
this
government
i
had
but
to
assent
to
the
urgent
entreaties
to
secure
that
position
for
myself
these
appointments
seem
the
result
of
nomination
by
the
people
yet
they
are
not
and
why
did
you
refuse
to
head
the
government
edmond
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
to
you
that
i
feared
to
accept
said
dantès
after
a
pause
my
own
selfishness
not
alas
my
disinterestedness
has
kept
me
from
the
post
of
peril
perhaps
indeed
i
can
do
far
more
for
the
cause
of
my
race
as
i
am
than
i
could
by
sacrificing
myself
for
office
and
position
at
least
i
hope
so
is
the
position
of
your
friends
then
so
perilous
asked
mercédès
dearest
they
stand
upon
a
volcano
said
dantès
solemnly
ha
cried
the
lady
in
alarm
mercédès
mercédès
continued
dantès
with
enthusiasm
i
sometimes
am
startled
with
the
idea
that
to
me
have
been
entrusted
the
awful
powers
of
foreknowledge
of
prophecy
so
fearfully
true
have
some
of
my
predictions
proved
the
events
of
the
past
week
i
foresaw
and
foretold
even
to
minute
circumstances
and
the
hours
of
their
occurrence
and
now
glorious
as
is
the
triumph
that
france
and
the
cause
of
man
have
achieved
i
perceive
in
the
dim
future
a
sea
of
commotion
all
is
not
yet
settled
within
one
month
revolution
will
succeed
revolution
throughout
europe
berlin
vienna
and
madrid
perhaps
also
petersburg
london
and
all
the
cities
of
italy
will
be
in
revolt
all
europe
must
and
will
feel
the
events
of
the
past
week
in
paris
europe
must
be
free
and
our
friends
lamartine
louis
blanc
within
six
months
louis
blanc
will
be
an
exile
and
lamartine
he
may
be
in
a
dungeon
or
on
a
scaffold
ah
exclaimed
mercédès
clinging
yet
more
closely
to
her
husband
but
the
cause
of
human
happiness
human
right
and
human
freedom
will
live
forever
that
must
be
will
be
eternal
as
eternal
my
adored
mercédès
as
is
our
own
deathless
love
chapter
xxvii
espérance
and
zuleika
during
the
whole
period
of
the
memorable
revolution
zuleika
never
once
saw
her
brother
though
she
was
burning
with
a
desire
to
have
an
interview
with
him
on
the
subject
that
had
caused
the
separation
between
her
young
italian
lover
and
herself
espérance
made
his
home
behind
the
barricades
from
the
time
the
struggle
began
until
the
people
finally
triumphed
gun
in
hand
he
fought
as
heroically
as
the
most
devoted
workman
fearlessly
exposing
himself
whenever
the
troops
pressed
his
comrades
in
arms
and
always
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
begrimed
with
dust
and
powder
his
garments
torn
by
bullets
and
bayonet
thrusts
his
hat
battered
and
rent
he
encouraged
the
people
by
word
and
example
constantly
shouting
vive
la
république
and
contending
for
liberty
with
the
bravery
of
a
lion
and
a
persistency
that
never
flagged
he
however
escaped
without
a
single
scratch
returning
to
the
paternal
mansion
utterly
worn
out
but
altogether
unhurt
proud
of
having
done
his
duty
as
a
man
and
a
patriot
and
of
having
sustained
the
glorious
cause
for
which
his
father
was
working
heart
and
soul
as
he
was
slowly
and
wearily
wending
his
way
homeward
he
suddenly
encountered
dantès
and
his
friend
lamartine
in
the
rue
richelieu
his
gun
was
on
his
shoulder
and
in
his
tattered
attire
with
the
dust
and
powder
on
his
face
and
hands
he
had
the
exact
appearance
of
an
insurrectionist
and
a
barricader
he
touched
his
hat
in
military
fashion
to
dantès
and
his
illustrious
companion
and
was
about
passing
on
when
his
father
recognized
him
and
ragged
and
begrimed
as
he
was
threw
his
arms
enthusiastically
about
his
neck
lamartine
watched
the
deputy
from
marseilles
and
could
not
restrain
an
expression
of
astonishment
at
his
singular
behavior
dantès
smiled
and
taking
espérance
by
the
hand
said
lamartine
you
will
i
know
make
every
allowance
for
me
when
you
learn
that
this
young
man
who
has
been
fighting
behind
the
barricades
with
the
people
is
my
son
the
head
of
the
provisional
government
instantly
grew
as
enthusiastic
as
dantès
himself
he
grasped
espérance
free
hand
and
shaking
it
with
the
utmost
cordiality
exclaimed
your
son
dantès
let
me
congratulate
you
why
he
is
a
perfect
hero
i
have
but
followed
my
father
teachings
and
done
what
he
would
have
done
had
he
been
my
age
and
unable
to
serve
the
great
cause
of
human
freedom
in
a
more
effective
way
dantès
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
and
a
faint
shade
of
color
appeared
upon
his
pale
cheeks
what
is
your
name
young
patriot
asked
lamartine
his
excitement
and
enthusiasm
continuing
to
hold
possession
of
him
espérance
was
the
reply
espérance
hope
the
name
is
both
appropriate
and
auspicious
with
such
heroic
young
men
as
you
fighting
for
our
cause
there
is
indeed
hope
and
of
the
brightest
and
best
kind
cried
lamartine
nay
nay
said
dantès
do
not
flatter
the
boy
he
has
but
done
his
duty
believe
me
i
do
not
flatter
him
returned
lamartine
i
have
simply
told
him
the
truth
in
time
he
will
rival
the
devotion
and
achievements
of
his
noble
father
enough
enough
said
the
deputy
modestly
we
deserve
only
the
credit
of
executing
god
will
we
are
merely
instruments
in
his
omnipotent
hand
he
added
impressively
and
such
instruments
are
exactly
what
we
need
in
the
present
crisis
god
grant
us
plenty
of
them
the
next
morning
zuleika
encountered
espérance
on
the
stairway
she
led
him
into
the
salon
and
when
they
were
seated
said
my
brother
i
have
a
question
to
ask
of
you
a
shadow
crossed
the
young
man
brow
and
he
quickly
asked
is
it
about
the
viscount
massetti
yes
then
i
must
refuse
to
answer
but
the
matter
concerns
my
happiness
nay
my
very
life
itself
think
of
that
before
you
finally
refuse
to
answer
my
question
espérance
hastily
and
excitedly
arose
from
his
chair
and
stood
in
front
of
his
sister
zuleika
said
he
in
an
agitated
tone
beware
of
that
man
beware
of
giovanni
massetti
beware
of
giovanni
espérance
and
why
the
young
man
began
to
pace
the
salon
with
short
and
nervous
steps
his
hands
twitched
convulsively
and
his
face
had
suddenly
assumed
the
whiteness
of
chalk
zuleika
zuleika
he
murmured
i
can
not
i
can
not
tell
you
why
it
would
crash
you
to
the
very
earth
and
make
you
blush
with
shame
that
you
had
ever
listened
to
the
seductive
tones
of
that
doubly
false
voice
but
espérance
said
zuleika
papa
certainly
knows
all
about
giovanni
if
he
did
not
altogether
approve
of
his
character
and
conduct
he
would
never
have
consented
to
admit
him
as
a
suitor
for
my
hand
a
suitor
for
your
hand
zuleika
my
god
has
he
then
dared
he
has
done
nothing
that
an
upright
and
honorable
man
should
not
do
interrupted
zuleika
warmly
he
did
not
even
call
here
until
he
had
written
to
papa
and
obtained
his
full
permission
to
do
so
zuleika
said
espérance
approaching
his
sister
and
taking
her
hand
no
doubt
giovanni
massetti
has
conducted
himself
in
all
respects
toward
you
like
a
perfect
gentleman
but
nevertheless
he
is
not
fit
to
be
my
sister
husband
but
papa
has
been
deceived
as
have
many
others
in
regard
to
the
true
character
and
standing
of
this
roman
nobleman
and
is
he
not
a
nobleman
once
more
i
must
refuse
to
answer
any
question
in
regard
to
him
i
can
only
tell
you
to
beware
and
shun
him
as
you
would
a
venomous
serpent
espérance
i
love
him
love
him
you
love
him
zuleika
oh
this
is
indeed
torture
the
young
man
dropped
his
sister
hand
and
flung
himself
upon
a
divan
he
was
a
prey
to
the
most
intense
excitement
zuleika
deeply
affected
to
see
him
thus
and
remembering
mysterious
behavior
together
with
his
strange
and
ominous
words
when
she
had
questioned
him
in
regard
to
his
quarrel
with
espérance
felt
for
a
moment
shaken
and
uncertain
she
also
recollected
that
at
the
time
of
the
inexplicable
difficulty
between
the
two
young
men
she
had
heard
rumors
to
the
effect
that
a
youthful
member
of
the
roman
aristocracy
had
abducted
a
beautiful
peasant
girl
in
which
affair
he
had
been
assisted
by
the
notorious
brigand
luigi
vampa
the
matter
however
had
almost
immediately
been
hushed
up
and
she
had
learned
none
of
the
circumstances
could
it
be
possible
that
giovanni
massetti
was
the
youthful
aristocrat
alluded
to
by
the
gossips
and
scandalmongers
of
the
eternal
city
that
he
was
the
abductor
of
the
unfortunate
peasant
girl
she
could
not
entertain
such
an
idea
and
yet
that
abduction
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
would
associate
itself
with
her
italian
lover
in
her
mind
she
arose
from
her
chair
and
going
to
the
divan
seated
herself
beside
espérance
determined
to
make
a
final
attempt
to
draw
his
secret
from
him
throwing
her
arms
tenderly
about
his
neck
she
said
in
a
coaxing
tone
if
any
sound
reason
exists
why
i
should
not
love
giovanni
massetti
and
you
know
it
your
plain
duty
as
my
brother
is
to
tell
me
will
you
not
tell
me
espérance
instead
of
replying
the
young
man
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
fairly
sobbed
in
his
anguish
zuleika
was
filled
with
pity
for
him
and
as
she
gazed
at
him
tears
came
into
her
eyes
but
still
bent
on
discovering
the
nature
of
the
obstacle
that
had
so
suddenly
loomed
up
between
giovanni
and
herself
she
continued
after
a
pause
in
the
same
coaxing
voice
espérance
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
should
not
be
treated
as
one
what
i
ask
of
you
is
only
reasonable
and
just
if
i
stand
on
the
brink
of
a
gulf
i
can
not
see
it
is
your
duty
to
inform
me
not
only
of
my
danger
but
also
of
its
nature
am
i
not
right
heaving
a
deep
sigh
espérance
replied
yes
you
are
right
zuleika
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
all
and
yet
i
can
not
at
least
tell
me
why
you
are
compelled
to
maintain
silence
on
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
did
you
question
the
viscount
i
did
and
what
answer
did
he
return
like
you
he
refused
to
answer
ah
then
he
has
some
sense
of
shame
left
shame
yes
shame
and
what
did
you
do
when
he
refused
to
speak
i
left
him
and
you
will
not
see
him
again
not
until
he
has
decided
to
tell
me
all
then
you
will
never
put
eyes
upon
him
more
he
dare
not
tell
you
dare
not
and
why
because
did
you
know
the
depth
of
his
infamy
you
would
spurn
him
from
you
suddenly
a
grave
suspicion
stole
into
zuleika
mind
and
made
her
tremble
from
head
to
foot
might
it
not
be
that
espérance
had
been
as
deeply
involved
in
the
mysterious
and
infamous
affair
of
which
he
declined
to
speak
as
giovanni
massetti
himself
the
thought
was
torment
and
totally
unable
to
restrain
her
keen
anxiety
to
be
instantly
informed
upon
this
topic
zuleika
gasped
out
were
you
not
espérance
as
guilty
as
your
former
friend
the
young
man
leaped
to
his
feet
as
if
a
tarantula
had
bitten
him
no
no
cried
he
i
was
innocent
of
all
blame
in
the
matter
luigi
vampa
he
abruptly
checked
himself
and
stood
staring
at
his
sister
as
if
in
dismay
at
having
unguardedly
uttered
the
brigand
name
but
zuleika
said
nothing
giovanni
massetti
also
had
protested
his
innocence
and
the
young
girl
knew
not
what
to
believe
luigi
vampa
so
then
he
had
been
a
party
to
this
mysterious
and
terrible
business
whatever
it
was
and
again
she
thought
of
the
abduction
of
the
beautiful
peasant
girl
could
that
be
the
fearful
secret
yes
it
must
be
luigi
vampa
had
assisted
in
that
abduction
if
report
could
be
relied
on
and
the
chief
criminal
had
been
a
youthful
member
of
the
roman
aristocracy
oh
it
was
all
plain
now
zuleika
shuddered
and
felt
her
heart
grow
heavy
as
lead
while
a
sharp
killing
pang
ran
through
it
had
espérance
been
misled
by
vampa
and
the
viscount
had
he
discovered
too
late
the
infamy
of
the
affair
and
challenged
massetti
on
that
account
this
was
doubtless
the
solution
of
the
whole
enigma
and
yet
zuleika
hesitated
to
accept
it
as
such
no
no
she
could
not
accept
it
without
further
and
more
convincing
proof
but
how
was
that
proof
to
be
obtained
neither
the
viscount
nor
her
brother
would
speak
it
was
evident
that
their
lips
were
sealed
possibly
an
oath
to
maintain
silence
had
been
extorted
from
them
under
terrible
circumstances
an
oath
they
feared
to
break
even
to
clear
themselves
from
a
foul
suspicion
but
vampa
he
might
perhaps
be
induced
to
give
the
key
to
the
mystery
vampa
however
was
far
away
in
rome
and
inaccessible
zuleika
made
a
wild
resolve
she
would
write
to
the
brigand
and
throw
herself
upon
his
generosity
then
she
decided
that
the
plan
was
impracticable
her
letter
would
never
reach
vampa
it
would
be
seized
by
the
roman
authorities
and
might
cause
additional
trouble
by
reviving
a
smothered
scandal
and
even
should
it
reach
the
brigand
would
he
answer
it
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
would
not
at
this
instant
an
inspiration
came
to
the
tortured
girl
like
a
flash
of
lightning
her
father
had
known
vampa
in
the
past
and
perhaps
still
possessed
some
influence
over
him
she
had
heard
the
story
of
albert
de
morcerf
adventure
in
the
catacombs
of
saint
sebastian
and
was
aware
that
the
brigand
chief
had
released
him
from
captivity
without
ransom
at
her
father
simple
solicitation
would
not
vampa
answer
her
questions
if
dantès
could
be
influenced
to
write
him
and
ask
them
she
had
full
faith
in
her
father
power
to
get
a
letter
to
the
bandit
notwithstanding
all
the
vigilance
of
the
roman
authorities
yes
she
would
go
to
him
tell
all
her
suspicions
without
reserve
and
beg
him
to
write
the
letter
it
was
hardly
likely
he
would
refuse
he
could
not
he
must
not
thus
resolved
zuleika
looked
her
brother
full
in
the
face
and
said
calmly
i
see
i
torture
you
with
my
questions
espérance
that
for
some
reason
best
known
to
yourself
you
can
not
answer
them
and
that
it
is
useless
to
torment
you
further
but
something
must
be
done
and
that
at
once
i
am
going
to
my
father
espérance
caught
her
wildly
by
the
arm
you
are
mad
cried
he
it
is
you
who
are
mad
you
and
giovanni
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
my
father
if
you
are
innocent
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
any
revelation
i
may
make
with
these
words
she
freed
herself
from
her
brother
grasp
and
quitted
the
salon
leaving
espérance
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
as
if
he
were
rooted
to
the
spot
chapter

captain
joliette
love
in
a
small
but
cosy
and
elegant
suite
of
apartments
in
a
mansion
on
the
rue
des
capucines
resided
mlle
louise
and
her
brother
léon
as
has
already
been
stated
the
celebrated
cantatrice
had
retired
from
the
boards
in
consequence
of
having
inherited
a
fortune
of
several
millions
of
francs
from
the
estate
of
her
deceased
father
who
rumor
asserted
had
been
a
very
wealthy
parisian
banker
léon
had
abandoned
the
stage
simultaneously
with
his
sister
who
had
invited
him
to
share
her
suddenly
acquired
riches
for
strange
to
say
the
banker
had
not
bequeathed
to
him
a
single
sou
the
immense
inheritance
had
been
a
complete
surprise
to
mlle
and
for
some
time
she
had
hesitated
to
accept
it
as
a
condition
imposed
by
the
will
was
her
immediate
withdrawal
from
her
operatic
career
and
the
prima
donna
was
as
ambitious
as
gifted
but
finally
she
had
yielded
to
the
persuasive
eloquence
of
the
notary
and
the
earnest
entreaties
of
her
friends
canceling
all
her
engagements
and
with
them
abandoning
her
bright
professional
future
the
director
of
the
académie
royale
demanded
a
large
sum
to
release
the
artiste
from
her
contract
with
him
and
this
was
paid
by
the
notary
with
an
alacrity
that
seemed
to
suggest
he
was
not
acting
solely
according
to
the
directions
of
the
will
but
was
influenced
by
some
personage
who
chose
to
remain
in
the
background
the
notary
also
paid
all
other
demands
made
by
the
various
operatic
managers
who
claimed
they
would
lose
by
mlle
failure
to
appear
these
amounts
were
not
deducted
from
the
legacy
a
circumstance
that
gave
additional
color
to
the
supposition
that
the
will
of
the
deceased
banker
was
not
the
sole
factor
in
the
celebrated
cantatrice
good
luck
one
evening
shortly
after
paris
had
again
quieted
down
mlle
was
seated
in
the
little
apartment
that
served
her
as
a
salon
and
with
her
was
her
brother
léon
the
contrast
between
the
pair
seemed
intensified
in
private
life
louise
had
that
dark
imperious
majestic
beauty
usually
possessed
by
brunettes
her
figure
was
full
and
finely
developed
her
black
eyes
had
the
deep
intense
fire
of
passion
and
her
faultless
countenance
glowing
with
health
and
loveliness
indicated
at
once
firmness
decision
and
caprices
without
number
léon
on
the
contrary
was
delicate
and
feminine
in
appearance
he
had
exceedingly
small
feet
and
hands
and
a
single
glance
at
his
strikingly
handsome
face
was
sufficient
to
convince
any
experienced
judge
of
human
nature
that
he
possessed
a
mild
and
yielding
disposition
the
young
man
bore
not
the
remotest
family
likeness
to
his
sister
and
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
they
could
be
in
any
way
related
léon
quitted
his
sister
and
going
to
a
piano
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
softly
opened
it
and
commenced
lightly
running
his
fingers
over
the
keys
then
he
seated
himself
at
the
instrument
and
played
an
air
from
lucrezia
borgia
with
brilliancy
and
effect
that
only
a
finished
performer
could
attain
at
the
first
notes
louise
arose
and
approaching
the
piano
stood
beside
the
player
her
eyes
sparkling
with
appreciation
and
delight
so
absorbed
were
the
brother
and
sister
that
they
did
not
hear
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
and
only
at
the
conclusion
of
the
air
did
they
realize
that
a
visitor
was
in
the
apartment
léon
sprang
from
the
instrument
in
confusion
behaving
like
a
startled
girl
but
mlle
with
perfect
turned
to
the
new
comer
and
said
in
a
tone
of
mingled
coquetry
and
merriment
so
so
captain
joliette
your
military
career
has
accustomed
you
to
surprising
the
enemy
to
such
an
extent
that
it
has
become
second
nature
with
you
and
you
can
not
avoid
carrying
your
favorite
tactics
even
into
private
life
captain
joliette
for
it
was
indeed
he
bowed
and
answered
with
a
smile
you
must
allow
me
solemnly
to
protest
against
classing
yourself
and
your
brother
with
the
enemy
you
are
both
of
you
very
dear
friends
especially
louise
said
léon
with
a
sly
look
and
a
pretty
little
ringing
laugh
léon
léon
when
will
you
learn
wisdom
exclaimed
mlle
a
blush
mantling
her
visage
and
adding
to
its
voluptuous
beauty
never
i
suppose
returned
her
brother
still
laughing
but
i
am
already
well
acquainted
with
the
value
of
discretion
and
therefore
will
withdraw
as
he
uttered
those
words
léon
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
louise
and
joliette
and
lightly
ran
from
the
salon
when
he
had
disappeared
the
captain
folded
mlle
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
tenderly
upon
the
forehead
oh
louise
said
he
enthusiastically
i
love
you
more
and
more
every
day
the
former
artiste
gently
disentangled
herself
from
his
embrace
and
smiling
archly
led
him
to
a
chair
then
she
sat
down
upon
another
at
a
short
distance
from
him
no
no
said
joliette
warmly
come
and
sit
beside
me
on
the
sofa
even
léon
sees
that
i
adore
you
and
all
my
friends
in
paris
are
aware
that
i
am
seeking
your
hand
in
marriage
why
will
you
be
so
formal
and
distant
with
me
she
arose
and
did
as
he
requested
joliette
seated
at
her
side
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
louise
did
not
resist
but
still
maintained
an
air
of
coquetry
that
was
displeasing
to
the
ardent
young
soldier
albert
she
said
in
a
low
musical
voice
do
you
indeed
love
me
as
you
say
love
you
louise
cried
joliette
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
you
are
you
quite
sure
you
love
me
for
myself
and
not
because
of
the
resemblance
you
say
i
bear
to
the
woman
you
once
so
ardently
admired
what
was
her
name
ah
eugénie
danglars
said
she
looking
at
him
with
a
piercing
gaze
quite
sure
louise
quite
sure
besides
mlle
danglars
has
disappeared
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
for
several
years
and
no
doubt
is
dead
and
yet
you
do
not
mourn
for
her
how
strange
i
never
loved
her
as
i
love
you
louise
eugénie
danglars
was
a
capricious
and
eccentric
girl
and
had
she
lived
would
have
been
a
capricious
and
eccentric
woman
it
was
well
for
me
she
vanished
when
she
did
but
by
the
way
another
singular
and
inexplicable
coincidence
is
that
louise
the
name
you
bear
was
also
the
name
of
mlle
danglars
music
teacher
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
understand
it
anyhow
it
is
a
coincidence
as
you
say
nothing
more
well
louise
let
us
speak
no
further
about
either
the
resemblance
or
the
coincidence
suffice
it
that
i
love
you
and
you
alone
that
i
love
you
for
yourself
your
words
make
me
very
happy
albert
replied
mlle
and
her
full
red
lips
looked
so
luscious
ripe
and
alluring
that
joliette
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
bestow
a
long
burning
kiss
upon
them
be
my
wife
then
dearest
louise
cried
the
captain
and
i
will
prolong
your
happiness
until
death
shall
strike
me
down
ah
albert
men
are
so
fickle
they
become
infatuated
with
women
and
declare
and
no
doubt
think
they
could
pass
their
lives
at
their
charmers
feet
but
possession
dulls
the
lustre
of
the
brightest
jewel
and
the
devoted
lover
is
speedily
replaced
by
a
careless
if
not
faithless
husband
who
instead
of
making
his
wife
happy
as
he
has
sworn
to
do
forsakes
her
side
to
bask
in
the
smiles
of
sirens
it
will
never
be
so
with
me
my
own
my
love
protested
joliette
kissing
her
again
and
again
i
swear
it
i
know
the
value
of
a
lover
oath
albert
murmured
louise
with
a
meaning
look
when
i
was
the
brightest
operatic
star
of
the
day
many
of
them
were
breathed
in
my
ear
but
they
were
light
as
air
forgotten
as
soon
as
uttered
besides
should
i
consent
to
become
your
wife
you
would
be
forced
to
leave
me
in
france
and
return
to
africa
in
obedience
to
the
call
of
duty
the
lovely
women
of
algeria
are
prodigal
of
their
beauties
and
endearments
and
under
the
spell
of
some
subtle
arab
enchantress
you
would
either
forget
poor
louise
altogether
or
remember
her
only
as
a
clog
upon
your
pleasures
and
amorous
delights
nay
nay
you
wrong
me
among
all
the
dusky
sirens
of
algeria
there
exists
not
one
who
could
make
me
forget
you
for
a
single
instant
they
are
brazen
shameless
women
who
love
with
a
recklessness
and
boldness
that
can
only
disgust
a
frenchman
but
they
can
dazzle
even
a
frenchman
render
him
delirious
with
passion
and
ere
he
is
aware
weave
a
web
around
him
through
which
he
can
not
break
my
heart
tells
me
you
are
as
susceptible
to
feminine
wiles
as
the
rest
of
your
countrymen
and
that
perhaps
you
have
already
had
in
algeria
oh
louise
louise
it
grieves
me
to
the
soul
that
you
can
thus
doubt
me
give
me
a
chance
to
prove
my
love
and
you
shall
be
more
than
satisfied
that
i
can
be
loyal
and
true
mlle
gazed
at
him
with
a
singular
expression
on
her
dark
beautiful
countenance
it
thrilled
him
to
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
and
caused
his
arm
that
was
about
her
waist
to
tremble
violently
at
that
moment
the
former
cantatrice
resembled
eugénie
danglars
more
than
ever
her
breath
was
hot
and
convulsive
as
it
struck
his
cheek
and
a
faint
suspicion
that
all
was
not
right
that
she
was
playing
a
rôle
with
him
shot
across
his
mind
for
the
first
time
with
this
suspicion
came
jealousy
and
releasing
her
waist
he
said
in
a
gasping
tone
you
have
another
lover
louise
a
lover
you
prefer
to
me
am
i
not
right
mlle
laughed
a
short
nervous
laugh
and
answered
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
mock
him
i
have
had
hosts
of
ardent
admirers
in
my
time
do
you
refer
particularly
to
any
individual
i
know
not
i
am
beside
myself
with
passion
for
you
and
the
mere
fancy
that
another
man
may
have
the
first
place
in
your
heart
is
unbearable
to
me
but
there
is
one
conclusive
way
in
which
you
can
prove
my
suspicion
my
jealousy
groundless
marry
me
albert
replied
louise
with
a
renewal
of
the
singular
expression
of
countenance
that
had
so
agitated
him
i
shall
never
marry
any
one
i
can
not
i
dare
not
the
young
man
was
startled
as
if
by
an
electric
shock
he
drew
back
and
gazed
at
her
with
eyes
speechless
from
astonishment
after
a
brief
pause
mlle
continued
in
a
dry
hard
tone
you
do
not
understand
me
and
i
can
not
expect
you
to
for
i
can
neither
tell
you
my
motives
nor
lay
bare
my
sad
history
to
you
you
must
be
content
with
my
decision
i
shall
not
marry
captain
joliette
strong
man
as
he
was
could
not
control
his
emotion
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
the
young
woman
gazed
at
him
half
pityingly
half
triumphantly
she
felt
compassion
for
her
stricken
lover
but
above
all
gloried
in
the
overwhelming
power
of
her
charms
that
could
so
subdue
a
manly
victorious
young
soldier
and
make
him
her
helpless
slave
is
there
then
no
shadow
of
a
hope
at
length
asked
joliette
in
a
hoarse
whisper
not
the
shadow
of
a
hope
replied
mlle
firmly
you
can
be
my
friend
my
brother
if
you
will
but
never
my
husband
the
young
man
recoiled
in
horror
at
the
suggestion
that
seemed
to
be
conveyed
by
this
permission
what
do
you
mean
by
friend
he
asked
a
cold
shiver
passing
through
him
louise
laughed
a
short
nervous
laugh
and
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
replied
you
know
what
i
mean
i
love
you
better
than
any
man
i
ever
met
save
one
captain
joliette
slowly
arose
to
his
feet
and
stood
staring
at
her
his
passion
and
his
scruples
waging
a
bitter
battle
within
him
for
the
mastery
the
temptress
half
reclined
on
the
sofa
a
miracle
of
seductive
grace
and
voluptuous
beauty
he
moved
toward
her
as
if
to
seize
her
in
his
arms
then
suddenly
checking
himself
he
asked
with
a
convulsive
gasp
and
that
man
that
one
was
separated
from
me
forever
through
the
vile
machinations
of
that
mysterious
and
fiend
the
count
of
the
count
of
exclaimed
the
young
man
lost
in
amazement
yes
the
count
of
who
afterwards
disappeared
from
paris
and
has
not
since
been
heard
of
you
mistake
the
count
of
is
in
paris
now
he
calls
himself
edmond
dantès
and
is
the
celebrated
deputy
from
marseilles
over
whom
everybody
has
gone
wild
for
some
time
past
mlle
eyes
flashed
with
fury
then
i
will
have
my
revenge
upon
him
at
last
she
cried
i
will
amply
repay
him
for
introducing
the
prince
cavalcanti
into
my
father
house
and
thus
breaking
off
the
match
between
albert
and
myself
albert
yes
albert
de
morcerf
now
eugénie
danglars
i
know
you
and
it
is
useless
for
you
to
attempt
the
denial
of
your
identity
longer
the
young
woman
leaped
up
from
the
sofa
with
terror
pictured
upon
her
visage
and
seizing
captain
joliette
by
the
arm
with
a
powerful
grasp
cried
out
and
how
pray
do
you
know
i
am
eugénie
danglars
you
unwittingly
betrayed
yourself
by
revealing
the
names
of
and
cavalcanti
besides
eugénie
look
at
me
well
i
am
albert
de
morcerf
with
a
wild
cry
the
retired
prima
donna
sank
back
upon
the
sofa
you
albert
de
morcerf
she
exclaimed
i
can
not
believe
it
but
my
mother
the
former
countess
de
morcerf
who
is
now
the
wife
of
edmond
dantès
will
vouch
for
my
identity
the
young
woman
passed
her
hand
across
her
forehead
as
if
dazed
if
you
are
albert
de
morcerf
you
must
despise
me
after
what
has
taken
place
this
evening
she
said
bitterly
despise
you
no
i
pity
and
forgive
you
albert
said
she
softly
come
here
and
sit
beside
me
on
this
sofa
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
the
soldier
obeyed
when
he
was
seated
he
said
eugénie
why
did
you
tell
me
i
could
be
your
friend
simply
because
i
have
long
suspected
your
secret
and
wished
to
ascertain
the
real
nature
of
your
feelings
toward
me
you
not
only
resisted
a
terrible
temptation
the
most
terrible
temptation
to
which
a
young
ardent
and
man
can
be
exposed
but
by
your
honor
conclusively
established
the
purity
and
sincerity
of
your
love
oh
albert
albert
are
you
satisfied
with
my
explanation
and
do
you
still
think
me
worthy
of
you
my
own
eugénie
my
happiness
is
far
too
great
for
words
murmured
the
delighted
young
man
gathering
his
beautiful
companion
in
a
warm
embrace
and
repeatedly
kissing
her
ripe
lips
and
blushing
cheeks
it
was
soon
known
throughout
paris
that
captain
joliette
and
albert
de
morcerf
were
identical
and
that
mlle
was
in
reality
no
other
than
mlle
eugénie
danglars
daughter
of
baron
danglars
the
once
famous
and
opulent
parisian
banker
the
report
also
was
current
that
albert
and
eugénie
were
engaged
and
would
shortly
be
united
in
the
bonds
of
matrimony
another
bit
of
gossip
was
to
the
effect
that
the
former
cantatrice
brother
léon
was
not
a
man
but
a
woman
in
short
the
real
louise
who
had
loaned
her
name
to
eugénie
danglars
and
assumed
male
attire
solely
for
professional
purposes
this
story
was
speedily
confirmed
for
léon
soon
vanished
and
in
his
place
appeared
a
most
attractive
and
fascinating
lady
who
very
quietly
assumed
or
rather
resumed
the
name
of
louise
still
another
rumor
was
that
the
wealth
so
strangely
inherited
by
the
former
prima
donna
was
not
a
legacy
at
all
but
a
gift
from
the
mysterious
count
of
who
had
thus
striven
to
make
amends
to
the
daughter
for
the
misfortunes
he
had
while
pursuing
his
scheme
of
wholesale
vengeance
so
remorselessly
heaped
upon
the
head
of
the
father
chapter
xxix
zuleika
goes
to
dantès
dantès
was
sitting
alone
in
his
library
busily
engaged
in
reading
a
favorite
work
on
the
subject
of
political
economy
and
from
time
to
time
making
copious
notes
it
was
after
midnight
and
the
vast
mansion
on
the
rue
du
helder
was
as
silent
as
the
tomb
the
lamp
on
the
deputy
table
burned
brightly
but
a
large
metallic
shade
concentrated
the
light
and
reflected
it
upon
the
table
so
that
the
other
portions
of
the
apartment
were
shrouded
in
almost
complete
darkness
as
dantès
read
a
shadow
suddenly
fell
on
the
page
of
his
book
and
quickly
looking
up
he
saw
his
daughter
zuleika
standing
beside
him
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
a
look
of
melancholy
rested
upon
her
countenance
why
child
said
her
father
in
a
startled
tone
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
weeping
and
seem
very
sad
has
anything
happened
to
young
massetti
not
that
i
am
aware
of
papa
answered
zuleika
in
a
low
voice
but
nevertheless
it
is
of
him
i
wish
to
speak
dantès
pushed
his
book
from
him
motioned
his
daughter
to
a
seat
and
prepared
to
listen
as
she
did
not
begin
at
once
but
seemed
to
hesitate
he
said
kindly
i
am
waiting
little
one
proceed
thus
encouraged
zuleika
summoned
up
all
her
strength
and
with
downcast
eyes
commenced
papa
said
she
in
the
first
place
let
me
assure
you
that
this
is
no
mere
lovers
quarrel
but
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
that
demands
immediate
action
dantès
knitted
his
brows
has
the
viscount
been
guilty
of
any
impropriety
toward
you
he
asked
fiercely
no
papa
not
toward
me
but
i
fear
he
may
have
been
guilty
of
impropriety
or
at
least
of
indiscretion
with
regard
to
another
in
the
past
a
woman
no
doubt
yes
papa
a
woman
a
roman
peasant
i
heard
of
some
such
thing
while
you
were
at
the
convent
school
in
rome
but
dismissed
it
as
a
slander
there
may
however
be
some
truth
in
it
but
now
i
recollect
giovanni
name
was
not
associated
with
the
scandal
it
was
a
mere
inference
on
my
part
that
connected
him
with
the
youthful
member
of
the
roman
aristocracy
mentioned
by
the
gossips
perhaps
i
am
unjust
papa
in
reviving
your
suspicions
but
strange
behavior
when
i
asked
him
the
cause
of
his
quarrel
with
espérance
and
of
the
continued
coldness
between
them
forced
me
to
think
there
was
something
wrong
his
quarrel
with
espérance
ah
now
i
remember
there
was
a
quarrel
but
i
imagined
it
was
settled
and
that
their
relations
were
altogether
friendly
they
are
enemies
papa
or
seem
to
be
and
that
is
not
all
espérance
accuses
giovanni
of
having
been
guilty
of
some
infamous
deed
you
have
spoken
to
espérance
then
on
the
subject
yes
papa
and
what
did
he
say
he
dealt
in
vague
denunciations
and
positively
refused
to
give
me
any
definite
information
that
is
singular
but
what
is
still
more
so
is
that
both
giovanni
and
espérance
seem
bound
by
some
fearful
oath
not
to
disclose
the
dread
secret
in
their
possession
bound
by
an
oath
yes
papa
but
why
both
of
them
should
have
been
so
bound
unless
they
were
accomplices
i
can
not
see
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
accuse
espérance
of
complicity
whereupon
he
grew
as
white
as
chalk
and
protested
his
entire
innocence
and
in
his
confusion
uttered
the
name
of
luigi
vampa
zuleika
zuleika
you
certainly
misunderstood
your
brother
he
could
not
have
mentioned
the
name
of
that
man
do
you
know
who
this
luigi
vampa
is
perfectly
papa
luigi
vampa
is
a
notorious
roman
brigand
exactly
my
child
and
therefore
could
not
possibly
have
had
any
dealings
either
with
the
viscount
or
espérance
but
i
am
sure
of
the
name
nevertheless
espérance
said
luigi
vampa
dantès
was
evidently
startled
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
paced
the
library
excitedly
zuleika
had
expected
this
and
hence
was
not
surprised
at
last
her
father
resumed
his
seat
and
when
he
again
came
within
reach
of
the
lamp
rays
she
saw
that
his
visage
was
even
more
pallid
than
usual
and
that
he
was
not
a
little
agitated
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
did
so
zuleika
said
he
in
a
tone
of
decision
i
will
see
both
the
viscount
and
my
son
in
regard
to
this
matter
for
now
that
luigi
vampa
seems
to
have
had
a
share
in
it
close
investigation
is
imperatively
demanded
you
may
interrogate
them
papa
but
i
am
convinced
in
advance
that
you
will
derive
no
information
from
either
of
them
the
strange
power
that
holds
sway
over
them
you
can
not
break
but
there
is
one
thing
you
can
do
what
is
that
zuleika
write
to
luigi
vampa
write
to
vampa
why
should
i
do
that
because
i
feel
assured
that
he
is
in
possession
of
the
full
details
of
the
terrible
secret
whatever
it
may
be
and
will
communicate
them
to
you
if
you
ask
him
to
do
so
dantès
gazed
at
his
daughter
curiously
what
makes
you
think
i
have
such
influence
over
this
roman
brigand
he
asked
sharply
oh
papa
do
not
be
angry
with
me
cried
zuleika
but
i
have
heard
how
vampa
released
the
viscount
de
morcerf
at
your
simple
solicitation
without
a
single
franc
of
ransom
though
he
had
previously
demanded
a
very
large
amount
from
the
unfortunate
man
as
the
price
of
his
liberty
i
have
heard
this
and
the
natural
inference
i
drew
was
that
if
the
brigand
chief
went
so
far
as
to
surrender
his
prey
to
you
he
would
certainly
answer
your
letter
and
tell
you
all
he
knew
about
the
matter
that
so
closely
concerns
my
happiness
and
espérance
good
name
i
am
not
angry
with
you
my
child
replied
the
deputy
in
a
milder
tone
for
i
know
how
deeply
you
have
this
affair
at
heart
i
will
write
to
luigi
vampa
as
you
desire
this
very
night
and
in
two
weeks
at
the
furthest
his
answer
may
be
expected
but
i
will
talk
with
espérance
and
then
will
question
the
viscount
rest
assured
that
this
matter
shall
be
sifted
to
the
bottom
i
know
the
extent
of
your
love
for
giovanni
massetti
i
also
feel
confident
that
i
am
not
deceived
in
him
and
that
he
will
be
amply
able
to
prove
himself
entirely
worthy
of
your
hand
i
have
seen
too
much
of
men
zuleika
and
studied
them
too
deeply
to
be
deceived
in
reading
character
oh
thank
you
thank
you
ever
so
much
papa
both
for
your
promise
and
your
kind
encouraging
words
i
too
have
full
faith
in
giovanni
but
still
i
can
not
rest
satisfied
until
his
record
is
entirely
and
conclusively
cleared
no
one
must
have
the
power
to
breathe
even
a
suspicion
against
the
good
name
of
your
daughter
husband
spoken
like
a
girl
of
spirit
said
dantès
his
eyes
sparkling
with
enthusiasm
and
admiration
now
leave
me
and
i
will
write
to
vampa
zuleika
kissed
her
father
and
quitted
the
library
with
a
much
lighter
heart
than
she
had
entered
it
dantès
by
the
exercise
of
his
iron
will
had
managed
to
control
himself
in
her
presence
but
now
that
she
had
gone
he
gave
free
course
to
his
emotions
for
a
full
hour
he
sat
leaning
on
his
his
frame
convulsed
with
anguish
and
his
mind
filled
with
sad
forebodings
he
did
not
for
an
instant
doubt
that
both
espérance
and
the
viscount
could
clear
themselves
from
any
criminal
or
dishonorable
charge
if
they
would
consent
to
open
their
lips
but
their
silence
and
zuleika
belief
that
they
were
bound
by
some
fearful
oath
gave
him
great
uneasiness
besides
his
son
had
mentioned
luigi
vampa
name
and
the
thought
that
the
young
man
was
involved
in
some
complication
with
the
roman
bandit
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
he
was
convinced
that
whatever
had
occurred
had
been
merely
the
result
of
the
folly
and
headlong
disposition
of
youth
but
this
was
scarcely
a
consolation
for
he
well
knew
to
what
length
young
men
sometimes
allowed
themselves
to
be
carried
especially
in
what
they
considered
a
in
addition
the
more
he
thought
of
the
roman
scandal
the
more
clearly
its
particulars
returned
to
him
he
remembered
that
a
young
and
handsome
peasant
girl
had
been
mysteriously
abducted
and
that
eventually
she
had
been
brought
back
to
her
home
by
one
of
the
shepherds
known
to
be
in
league
with
luigi
vampa
and
his
band
she
asserted
that
she
had
been
carried
off
to
the
bandits
haunt
by
her
youthful
lover
who
had
passed
for
a
peasant
lad
but
was
in
reality
a
nobleman
this
was
all
dantès
could
distinctly
recall
though
he
was
certain
he
had
heard
other
details
that
had
slipped
his
memory
at
the
period
of
the
abduction
he
now
remembered
both
espérance
and
the
viscount
were
temporarily
absent
from
rome
then
followed
their
return
and
the
quarrel
that
had
almost
resulted
in
a
duel
but
had
suddenly
been
patched
up
without
apparent
reason
had
espérance
and
the
viscount
been
concerned
in
the
abduction
that
was
a
question
that
only
they
or
luigi
vampa
could
answer
and
it
was
evident
the
young
men
would
not
speak
vampa
then
must
be
made
to
speak
for
them
that
was
the
sole
course
left
to
pursue
for
the
peasant
girl
had
disappeared
immediately
after
her
return
and
her
whereabouts
were
a
mystery
dantès
drew
writing
materials
before
him
and
wrote
his
letter
to
the
brigand
chief
it
was
brief
but
to
the
point
when
it
was
finished
it
bore
the
signature
edmond
dantès
count
of
the
deputy
placed
it
in
the
drawer
of
his
table
to
go
by
mail
the
following
morning
having
first
folded
and
sealed
it
thomson
and
french
rome
was
the
direction
it
bore
chapter
xxx
two
interviews
the
morning
following
the
events
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
as
espérance
was
in
his
preparing
to
take
a
short
stroll
through
paris
ali
knocked
at
the
door
and
signified
that
dantès
wished
to
see
him
at
once
in
the
library
as
such
a
summons
was
something
unusual
the
young
man
immediately
concluded
that
zuleika
had
been
in
consultation
with
her
father
and
that
he
would
now
have
to
submit
to
a
close
and
rigid
examination
he
had
expected
such
an
examination
but
nevertheless
the
summons
filled
him
with
dismay
and
he
grew
pale
as
wax
his
limbs
trembling
beneath
him
and
his
hands
working
nervously
however
he
braced
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
with
as
firm
a
step
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
assume
walked
toward
the
library
on
the
threshold
he
paused
and
his
courage
so
utterly
forsook
him
that
he
was
tempted
to
take
refuge
in
flight
but
the
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
that
this
would
be
cowardly
and
making
a
supreme
effort
to
control
himself
he
entered
his
father
presence
dantès
who
was
seated
at
his
examining
a
curious
manuscript
written
in
arabic
characters
looked
up
as
he
came
in
and
fixed
his
eyes
searchingly
upon
his
son
countenance
noting
its
extreme
pallor
and
remarking
with
manifest
uneasiness
the
difficulty
espérance
experienced
in
maintaining
a
firm
demeanor
motioning
the
young
man
to
a
seat
he
said
my
son
i
have
sent
for
you
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
and
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
see
fit
to
tell
me
in
all
frankness
whatever
you
may
know
in
regard
to
it
espérance
partially
closed
his
eyes
as
if
suffering
intensely
bringing
his
teeth
firmly
together
and
compressing
his
lips
as
he
did
not
speak
dantès
continued
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
revelation
i
am
about
to
ask
of
you
will
be
exceedingly
painful
for
you
to
make
but
you
must
consider
that
your
sister
happiness
is
deeply
concerned
and
that
for
that
reason
no
matter
what
may
be
your
motives
you
have
not
the
right
to
maintain
silence
i
know
what
you
mean
father
replied
espérance
in
an
unsteady
voice
but
notwithstanding
the
pain
it
gives
me
to
do
so
i
must
ask
you
nay
entreat
you
not
to
question
me
for
i
can
not
answer
you
dantès
cast
upon
his
son
a
glance
that
seemed
to
pierce
him
through
and
through
the
young
man
quailed
beneath
it
and
again
partially
closed
his
eyes
while
a
faint
blue
shade
was
mixed
with
the
waxen
pallor
of
his
visage
the
deputy
though
he
had
made
a
profound
and
exhaustive
study
of
men
and
their
varied
motives
though
he
was
a
skilled
anatomist
of
the
human
heart
and
a
ready
reader
of
the
human
countenance
acknowledged
to
himself
that
this
time
he
was
completely
baffled
was
it
fear
or
guilt
that
espérance
exhibited
he
could
not
tell
but
it
was
abundantly
evident
that
the
young
man
was
not
acting
a
part
that
he
keenly
felt
the
suspicions
to
which
he
was
exposing
himself
by
his
inexplicable
conduct
at
length
dantès
said
in
a
mild
but
determined
tone
espérance
my
son
you
can
at
least
enlighten
me
upon
a
few
points
and
i
request
nay
i
command
you
to
do
so
are
you
bound
by
oath
to
preserve
silence
concerning
this
matter
i
am
bound
by
a
most
solemn
oath
answered
the
young
man
with
a
shudder
and
is
giovanni
massetti
likewise
so
bound
he
is
i
will
not
ask
you
who
administered
that
oath
to
you
or
under
what
circumstances
it
was
taken
although
as
your
father
i
have
a
right
to
do
so
and
to
compel
you
to
answer
neither
will
i
interrogate
you
further
in
regard
to
the
main
question
at
issue
the
complication
in
which
you
and
the
viscount
seem
to
be
so
hopelessly
involved
but
i
insist
that
you
inform
me
whether
any
guilt
or
stain
of
dishonor
rests
upon
you
father
said
espérance
rising
and
lifting
his
right
hand
toward
heaven
i
solemnly
swear
to
you
that
whatever
wrong
may
have
been
done
whatever
crime
may
have
been
committed
i
am
entirely
guiltless
and
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
stain
of
dishonor
upon
me
i
believe
you
my
son
said
dantès
in
a
tone
of
conviction
and
this
unequivocal
assurance
from
your
own
lips
removes
the
weight
of
a
mountain
from
me
now
tell
me
is
the
viscount
massetti
as
blameless
in
this
affair
as
you
are
the
viscount
massetti
is
a
villain
cried
espérance
excitedly
he
is
guilty
of
a
foul
and
revolting
crime
a
crime
that
should
condemn
him
to
a
life
of
penal
servitude
but
may
you
not
be
mistaken
may
you
not
be
the
victim
of
some
delusion
asked
dantès
anxiously
i
am
neither
mistaken
father
nor
the
victim
of
a
delusion
replied
espérance
positively
the
charges
that
i
make
against
that
miserable
apology
for
a
man
i
can
fully
substantiate
should
the
proper
opportunity
ever
be
offered
me
zuleika
informed
me
that
while
you
were
speaking
with
her
upon
this
mysterious
subject
the
name
of
luigi
vampa
escaped
your
lips
does
that
notorious
brigand
posses
a
knowledge
of
this
unfortunate
matter
espérance
became
violently
agitated
and
instantly
answered
that
is
a
question
my
oath
forbids
me
to
reply
to
so
be
it
said
dantès
but
i
have
written
him
and
he
will
reply
for
you
you
have
written
to
vampa
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
a
look
then
all
is
lost
dantès
smiled
and
rising
placed
his
hand
on
his
son
shoulder
espérance
said
he
calmly
if
neither
crime
nor
dishonor
attaches
to
you
in
this
affair
as
you
have
sworn
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
fear
and
besides
vampa
disclosures
may
relieve
you
of
some
portion
of
your
heavy
burden
oh
god
groaned
the
young
man
if
vampa
speaks
how
shall
i
be
able
to
prove
my
innocence
my
son
said
dantès
impressively
god
whose
name
you
have
invoked
will
not
desert
you
in
your
hour
of
need
bowing
his
head
in
his
hands
and
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
espérance
quitted
the
library
with
a
convulsive
sob
as
if
the
last
ray
of
hope
had
been
withdrawn
from
his
life
and
all
was
darkness
and
despair
dantès
threw
himself
in
his
chair
and
for
an
instant
was
plunged
in
absorbing
thought
then
he
arose
and
putting
on
his
hat
and
cloak
left
the
library
a
few
moments
later
he
had
quitted
the
mansion
by
a
private
door
closely
muffling
his
face
in
the
folds
of
his
cloak
that
he
might
not
be
recognized
the
deputy
from
marseilles
passed
hurriedly
from
street
to
street
until
he
stood
before
a
massive
building
in
the
rue
vivienne
he
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
concierge
appeared
said
to
her
is
the
viscount
massetti
at
home
the
woman
a
large
fat
lumbering
creature
cast
a
sleepy
glance
that
was
at
him
and
answered
yes
monsieur
but
he
bade
me
deny
him
to
everybody
he
will
see
me
however
my
good
woman
said
dantès
take
my
card
to
him
the
fat
concierge
took
the
card
and
glanced
at
it
when
she
read
edmond
dantès
deputy
from
marseilles
she
stared
at
the
famous
republican
leader
like
one
possessed
then
filled
with
awe
she
hastened
away
and
climbed
the
stairs
as
fast
as
her
cumbersome
legs
would
let
her
she
returned
panting
and
puffing
followed
by
the
viscount
valet
who
with
much
ceremony
and
obsequiousness
conducted
the
distinguished
visitor
to
his
master
apartments
the
salon
into
which
dantès
was
ushered
was
large
and
sumptuously
furnished
evidences
of
wealth
and
luxury
were
visible
on
every
side
while
everything
displayed
the
utmost
taste
and
elegance
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
the
honor
of
this
unexpected
visit
my
dear
count
said
massetti
rising
from
a
handsomely
carved
red
velvet
upholstered
in
which
he
had
been
indolently
reclining
and
coming
forward
to
greet
his
guest
to
a
matter
that
concerns
both
of
us
deeply
replied
the
deputy
in
a
meaning
tone
a
shadow
crossed
the
viscount
handsome
visage
but
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
and
he
said
with
the
utmost
politeness
pray
be
seated
my
dear
count
and
before
proceeding
to
business
refresh
yourself
with
a
glass
of
rare
old
burgundy
here
stephano
wine
and
glasses
dantès
sat
down
in
an
precisely
resembling
that
from
which
the
viscount
had
arisen
massetti
resumed
his
seat
and
the
valet
brought
the
old
burgundy
and
glasses
placing
the
decanter
and
drinking
vessels
on
a
small
table
of
glistening
ebony
between
his
master
and
the
deputy
after
they
had
duly
drunk
each
other
health
dantès
said
i
regret
my
dear
viscount
that
i
am
compelled
to
disturb
you
but
my
business
was
too
urgent
for
delay
you
do
disturb
me
in
the
least
pray
proceed
you
remember
your
conversation
with
my
daughter
just
before
you
and
she
parted
do
you
not
i
remember
it
replied
the
viscount
coloring
slightly
and
evidently
growing
ill
at
ease
in
that
case
neither
preface
nor
explanation
is
necessary
i
called
to
ask
you
a
few
plain
questions
the
italian
was
now
a
prey
to
singular
excitement
he
grew
pale
and
flushed
by
turns
finally
rising
and
pacing
the
salon
in
great
agitation
count
said
he
abruptly
when
he
could
command
his
voice
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
cosmopolitan
and
of
course
you
know
that
one
often
commits
folly
especially
when
the
ardent
and
uncontrollable
blood
of
youth
is
rushing
through
his
veins
with
this
explanation
imperfect
though
it
be
i
must
ask
you
to
rest
satisfied
for
it
is
utterly
out
of
my
power
to
give
you
any
other
or
to
enter
into
the
details
of
the
unfortunate
affair
which
has
brought
you
here
i
assure
you
however
that
i
am
altogether
blameless
in
the
matter
investigation
will
abundantly
establish
the
truth
of
what
i
say
i
will
make
that
investigation
i
regret
that
i
can
neither
empower
you
to
do
so
nor
aid
you
in
it
what
am
i
to
understand
by
that
simply
what
i
say
you
are
doubtless
aware
that
my
son
makes
grave
accusations
against
you
that
he
accuses
you
in
fact
of
a
dastardly
crime
espérance
is
mistaken
my
dear
count
i
swear
to
you
that
he
is
mistaken
and
that
i
am
as
innocent
as
he
is
but
luigi
vampa
may
have
a
different
tale
to
tell
luigi
vampa
cried
the
viscount
coming
instantly
to
a
dead
halt
and
a
sudden
pallor
overspreading
his
entire
visage
yes
luigi
vampa
i
have
written
to
him
and
in
two
weeks
will
have
his
answer
for
espérance
sake
for
my
sake
for
your
daughter
sake
destroy
that
answer
as
soon
as
received
and
without
reading
it
exclaimed
the
young
italian
wildly
his
pallor
increasing
to
such
a
degree
that
his
face
resembled
that
of
a
corpse
should
i
be
mad
enough
to
do
so
said
dantès
calmly
with
it
all
hope
of
your
marriage
with
zuleika
would
perish
oh
do
not
say
that
do
not
say
that
groaned
massetti
what
would
life
be
worth
to
me
without
zuleika
love
then
deserve
that
love
by
clearing
yourself
by
proving
that
your
record
will
bear
the
light
of
day
i
have
sworn
to
you
that
i
am
innocent
is
not
that
enough
no
replied
dantès
coldly
i
must
have
proof
to
support
your
oath
then
you
believe
me
guilty
in
spite
of
all
this
is
the
worst
blow
yet
it
is
in
your
power
to
completely
justify
yourself
at
least
so
you
give
me
to
understand
and
yet
your
refusal
will
forever
separate
you
from
the
woman
you
love
you
fill
me
with
despair
said
massetti
in
a
smothered
voice
sinking
upon
a
sofa
i
fain
would
reveal
everything
to
you
but
an
awful
oath
of
silence
stands
between
me
and
the
revelation
then
i
must
wait
for
vampa
answer
and
shape
my
course
by
that
said
dantès
firmly
that
answer
will
destroy
both
espérance
and
myself
replied
the
viscount
in
a
hoarse
whisper
we
shall
see
returned
the
deputy
rising
and
resuming
his
cloak
as
he
stood
at
the
door
of
the
salon
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
added
i
thought
you
all
a
man
should
be
viscount
and
that
you
would
make
zuleika
happy
but
my
convictions
have
been
sadly
shaken
i
came
here
thinking
that
love
for
woman
was
all
powerful
in
the
heart
of
man
that
it
would
induce
you
to
speak
even
in
the
face
of
an
oath
perhaps
violently
and
iniquitously
administered
i
was
wrong
farewell
dantès
turned
slowly
and
took
his
departure
leaving
giovanni
massetti
on
the
sofa
plunged
in
grief
and
dismay
chapter
xxxi
vampa
answer
as
the
time
for
the
arrival
of
luigi
vampa
answer
to
dantès
letter
approached
espérance
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
and
serious
he
spent
the
greater
portion
of
every
day
from
home
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
his
father
and
sister
when
he
returned
he
was
moody
depressed
and
silent
and
far
into
the
night
he
could
be
heard
pacing
his
chamber
as
if
unable
to
sleep
from
excitement
and
anxiety
zuleika
endeavored
to
comfort
him
but
all
her
efforts
were
fruitless
she
poor
girl
was
herself
overwhelmed
with
her
own
distress
though
she
strove
to
bear
up
against
it
massetti
had
neither
written
to
nor
attempted
to
see
her
since
their
separation
a
circumstance
she
could
not
reconcile
with
his
protestations
of
ardent
love
for
her
and
this
served
vastly
to
augment
her
sadness
and
anguish
though
she
still
believed
in
her
soul
that
the
viscount
was
entirely
innocent
of
the
crime
laid
to
his
charge
dantès
who
had
plunged
into
politics
deeper
than
ever
since
the
success
of
the
revolution
was
frequently
in
consultation
with
the
republican
leaders
and
many
of
them
visited
him
at
his
residence
and
were
closeted
with
him
for
hours
at
a
time
but
though
seemingly
engrossed
in
state
affairs
the
deputy
did
not
lose
sight
of
his
son
and
daughter
or
of
the
mysterious
complication
that
vampa
was
expected
to
make
clear
ali
had
strict
orders
to
watch
both
zuleika
and
espérance
and
to
report
to
his
master
whatever
they
did
when
at
home
in
his
absence
but
the
faithful
nubian
found
nothing
amiss
save
that
the
young
people
seemed
burdened
with
a
sorrow
he
could
not
fathom
at
length
when
the
two
weeks
that
it
would
take
to
hear
from
rome
had
expired
lamartine
called
one
morning
at
the
mansion
in
the
rue
du
helder
and
having
finished
his
business
with
dantès
was
invited
by
his
host
to
remain
to
lunch
the
repast
was
served
in
the
espérance
and
zuleika
partaking
of
it
with
their
father
and
his
illustrious
guest
when
the
edibles
had
been
removed
and
the
party
were
taking
wine
at
the
dantès
suddenly
remembering
that
he
had
an
engagement
begged
lamartine
to
excuse
him
and
remain
with
his
son
and
daughter
until
his
return
that
would
be
in
half
an
hour
at
the
utmost
this
arrangement
effected
the
deputy
arose
from
his
chair
threw
his
cloak
over
his
arm
and
was
about
to
take
his
departure
when
ali
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
open
doorway
bearing
in
his
hand
a
letter
instantly
divining
that
this
was
answer
upon
which
hung
massetti
fate
and
his
own
espérance
leaped
to
his
feet
and
fixed
his
wild
and
staring
eyes
on
the
ominous
missive
as
if
he
would
read
its
contents
through
its
folds
zuleika
retained
her
seat
but
lifted
her
hands
in
terror
and
stared
at
the
letter
with
pallid
cheeks
and
blanched
lips
even
lamartine
turned
in
his
chair
and
holding
his
glass
in
his
hand
gazed
wonderingly
at
the
nubian
and
the
epistle
dantès
alone
seemed
unmoved
and
his
pale
countenance
gave
no
sign
of
the
emotion
struggling
in
his
breast
he
stood
like
a
man
of
iron
and
extending
his
hand
took
the
letter
without
a
tremor
it
was
enclosed
in
a
envelope
evidently
made
by
the
writer
himself
and
bore
the
roman
postmark
the
direction
written
in
bold
scrawling
but
perfectly
legible
characters
read
edmond
dantès
deputy
from
marseilles
no
rue
du
helder
paris
france
personal
and
private
this
direction
was
in
french
ali
having
retired
the
deputy
calmly
broke
the
seal
and
hurriedly
ran
his
eyes
over
the
missive
espérance
and
zuleika
eagerly
and
breathlessly
watched
his
countenance
while
he
read
but
it
was
as
impassable
as
a
countenance
chiseled
from
marble
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
espérance
and
without
a
word
handed
him
the
letter
for
a
moment
the
young
man
trembled
so
he
could
not
read
cold
perspiration
stood
in
heavy
beads
upon
his
forehead
and
vivid
flashes
of
red
passed
before
his
eyes
like
sheets
of
lurid
lightning
what
thoughts
what
suspicions
what
dread
shot
through
his
tortured
mind
in
that
brief
moment
making
it
seem
an
eternity
of
suffering
at
last
steadying
and
controlling
himself
by
a
supreme
effort
he
read
the
missive
from
which
he
had
feared
such
terrible
consequences
it
was
in
italian
and
ran
as
follows
his
excellency
the
count
of
you
ask
me
to
answer
your
questions
and
i
comply
pasquale
solara
daughter
annunziata
was
abducted
from
her
father
by
giovanni
massetti
known
as
the
viscount
massetti
who
is
no
doubt
the
person
to
whom
you
allude
as
now
in
paris
for
he
has
disappeared
from
rome
you
are
right
in
assuming
that
he
had
aid
he
was
assisted
by
a
young
frenchman
and
that
young
frenchman
was
your
son
espérance
annunziata
suffered
the
usual
fate
of
abducted
peasant
girls
and
was
deserted
by
her
dastardly
abductor
in
a
fastness
controlled
by
my
band
when
the
abduction
took
place
annunziata
brother
strove
to
rescue
her
but
was
attacked
and
killed
by
massetti
through
my
means
the
girl
was
returned
to
her
home
but
she
was
miserable
there
and
fled
she
is
now
in
an
asylum
for
unfortunate
women
founded
at
civita
vecchia
by
the
order
of
sisters
of
refuge
and
superintended
by
a
french
lady
a
madame
helena
de
rancogne
who
as
is
said
was
formerly
called
the
countess
of
it
is
due
to
your
son
to
say
that
he
was
entirely
misled
in
regard
to
the
abduction
of
annunziata
solara
and
is
altogether
innocent
of
crime
or
intention
to
commit
it
the
whole
burden
of
guilt
rests
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
viscount
massetti
who
i
believe
compelled
your
son
at
the
pistol
mouth
to
take
a
fearful
oath
of
silence
luigi
vampa
when
espérance
had
read
this
letter
that
so
effectually
cleared
him
and
was
such
a
fearful
arraignment
of
the
viscount
massetti
he
restored
it
to
his
father
and
sank
into
his
chair
utterly
overcome
by
the
terrible
excitement
and
mental
strain
through
which
he
had
passed
dantès
forced
him
to
swallow
a
glass
of
wine
that
partially
restored
him
then
turning
to
lamartine
who
had
been
an
astonished
spectator
of
this
strange
and
to
him
incomprehensible
family
scene
he
said
my
dear
friend
you
are
amazed
and
you
have
a
right
to
be
this
letter
that
has
caused
my
son
and
daughter
so
much
emotion
comes
from
a
roman
brigand
chief
no
other
than
luigi
vampa
whose
name
is
notorious
throughout
europe
you
will
understand
its
importance
when
i
inform
you
that
it
conclusively
clears
my
son
of
an
exceedingly
grave
charge
lamartine
arose
and
took
espérance
by
the
hand
i
heartily
congratulate
you
said
he
and
giovanni
massetti
asked
zuleika
in
a
tremulous
voice
giovanni
massetti
is
unworthy
of
my
daughter
hand
replied
dantès
let
me
see
that
letter
said
zuleika
her
cheek
growing
paler
and
her
heart
beating
tumultuously
her
father
gave
it
to
her
she
took
it
and
read
each
line
with
an
intensity
of
interest
that
was
painful
to
behold
when
she
had
reached
the
end
her
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
and
the
color
came
rushing
back
to
her
pallid
cheeks
espérance
she
said
facing
her
brother
with
an
air
of
resolution
beneath
which
he
quailed
luigi
vampa
has
not
told
all
something
he
has
kept
back
and
that
something
you
know
what
is
it
speak
luigi
vampa
has
told
the
truth
replied
the
young
man
doggedly
yes
but
not
the
whole
truth
what
has
he
kept
back
espérance
shook
his
head
he
has
told
the
truth
he
repeated
did
the
viscount
massetti
administer
the
oath
of
silence
to
you
he
did
then
who
administered
that
oath
to
giovanni
the
young
man
did
not
answer
there
is
some
mystery
about
this
complicated
affair
yet
unexplained
and
until
it
is
explained
i
can
not
believe
giovanni
massetti
guilty
come
come
my
daughter
said
dantès
soothingly
your
heart
speaks
and
not
your
mind
my
heart
and
mind
both
speak
papa
replied
zuleika
and
both
say
that
giovanni
massetti
is
innocent
let
him
prove
it
then
i
feel
certain
that
he
can
and
will
well
well
child

to
madame
dantès
and
take
counsel
of
her

a
woman

heal
a
young
girl

wounds
zuleika
quitted
the
her
countenance
yet
bearing
the
stamp
of
an
inflexible
belief
and
a
fixed
determination

dantès

blessings

day

well

patriot
said
lamartine
and

feel
assured
that
your
son
will
be
worthy
of
you
and
of
our
beloved
france

very
day

note

tiny
feminine
hand

phrased
