proofreading
team
adventures
in
friendship
by
david
grayson
i
an
adventure
in
fraternity
this
i
am
firmly
convinced
is
a
strange
world
as
strange
a
one
as
i
was
ever
in
looking
about
me
i
perceive
that
the
simplest
things
are
the
most
difficult
the
plainest
things
the
darkest
the
commonest
things
the
rarest
i
have
had
an
amusing
adventure
and
made
a
friend
this
morning
when
i
went
to
town
for
my
marketing
i
met
a
man
who
was
a
mason
an
oddfellow
and
an
elk
and
who
wore
the
evidences
of
his
various
memberships
upon
his
coat
he
asked
me
what
lodge
i
belonged
to
and
he
slapped
me
on
the
back
in
the
heartiest
manner
as
though
he
had
known
me
intimately
for
a
long
time
i
may
say
in
passing
that
he
was
trying
to
sell
me
a
new
kind
of
i
could
not
help
feeling
complimented
both
complimented
and
abashed
for
i
am
not
a
mason
or
an
oddfellow
or
an
elk
when
i
told
him
so
he
seemed
much
surprised
and
disappointed
you
ought
to
belong
to
one
of
our
lodges
he
said
you
be
sure
of
having
loyal
friends
wherever
you
go
he
told
me
all
about
his
grips
and
passes
and
benefits
he
told
me
how
much
it
would
cost
me
to
get
in
and
how
much
more
to
stay
in
and
how
much
for
a
uniform
which
was
not
compulsory
he
told
me
about
the
fine
funeral
the
masons
would
give
me
he
said
that
the
elks
would
care
for
my
widow
and
children
you
just
the
sort
of
a
man
he
said
that
we
like
to
have
in
our
lodge
i
enjoy
giving
you
the
grip
of
fellowship
he
was
a
rotund
man
with
a
shining
red
nose
and
a
husky
voice
he
grew
so
much
interested
in
telling
me
about
his
lodges
that
i
think
i
he
forgot
momentarily
that
he
was
selling
which
was
certainly
to
his
credit
as
i
drove
homeward
this
afternoon
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
masons
the
oddfellows
and
the
elks
and
curiously
not
without
a
sense
of
depression
i
wondered
if
my
friend
of
the
had
found
the
pearl
of
great
price
that
i
have
been
looking
for
so
long
for
is
not
friendliness
the
thing
of
all
things
that
is
most
pleasant
in
this
world
sometimes
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
faculty
of
reaching
out
and
touching
one
neighbour
where
he
really
lives
is
the
greatest
of
human
achievements
and
it
was
with
an
indescribable
depression
that
i
wondered
if
these
masons
and
oddfellows
and
elks
had
in
reality
caught
the
elusive
secret
and
confined
it
within
the
insurmountable
and
impenetrable
walls
of
their
mysteries
secrets
grips
passes
benefits
it
must
indeed
i
said
to
myself
be
a
precious
sort
of
fraternity
that
they
choose
to
protect
so
sedulously
i
felt
as
though
life
contained
something
that
i
was
not
permitted
to
live
i
recalled
how
my
friend
of
the
had
wished
to
give
me
the
grip
of
the
fellowship
only
he
could
not
i
was
not
entitled
to
it
i
knew
no
grips
or
passes
i
wore
no
uniform
it
is
a
complicated
matter
this
fellowship
i
said
to
myself
so
i
jogged
along
feeling
rather
blue
marveling
that
those
things
which
often
seem
so
simple
should
be
in
reality
so
difficult
but
on
such
an
afternoon
as
this
no
man
could
possibly
remain
long
depressed
the
moment
i
passed
the
straggling
outskirts
of
the
town
and
came
to
the
open
road
the
light
and
glow
of
the
countryside
came
in
upon
me
with
a
newness
and
sweetness
impossible
to
describe
looking
out
across
the
wide
fields
i
could
see
the
vivid
green
of
the
young
wheat
upon
the
brown
soil
in
a
distant
high
pasture
the
cows
had
been
turned
out
to
the
freshening
grass
a
late
pool
glistened
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
and
the
crows
were
calling
and
the
robins
had
begun
to
come
and
oh
the
moist
cool
freshness
of
the
air
in
the
highest
heaven
never
so
high
as
at
this
time
of
the
year
floated
a
few
gauzy
clouds
the
whole
world
was
busy
with
spring
i
straightened
up
in
my
buggy
and
drew
in
a
good
breath
the
mare
half
startled
pricked
up
her
ears
and
began
to
trot
she
too
felt
the
spring
here
i
said
aloud
is
where
i
belong
i
am
native
to
this
place
of
all
these
things
i
am
a
part
but
presently
how
one
mind
courses
back
like
some
hound
for
lost
trails
i
began
to
think
again
of
my
friend
lodges
and
do
you
know
i
had
lost
every
trace
of
depression
the
whole
matter
lay
as
clear
in
my
mind
as
little
complicated
as
the
countryside
which
met
my
eye
so
openly
why
i
exclaimed
to
myself
i
need
not
envy
my
friend
lodges
i
myself
belong
to
the
greatest
of
all
fraternal
orders
i
am
a
member
of
the
universal
brotherhood
of
men
it
came
to
me
so
humorously
as
i
sat
there
in
my
buggy
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
aloud
and
i
was
so
deeply
absorbed
with
the
idea
that
i
did
not
at
first
see
the
whiskery
old
man
who
was
coming
my
way
in
a
farm
wagon
he
looked
at
me
curiously
as
he
passed
giving
me
half
the
road
i
glanced
up
at
him
and
called
out
cheerfully
how
are
you
brother
you
should
have
seen
him
look
and
look
and
look
after
i
had
passed
i
glanced
back
he
had
stopped
his
team
turned
half
way
around
in
his
high
seat
and
was
watching
me
for
he
did
not
understand
yes
my
friend
i
said
to
myself
i
intoxicated
with
the
wine
of
spring
i
reflected
upon
his
astonishment
when
i
addressed
him
as
brother
a
strange
word
he
did
not
recognize
it
he
actually
suspected
that
he
was
not
my
brother
so
i
jogged
onward
thinking
about
my
fraternity
and
i
do
know
when
i
have
had
more
joy
of
an
idea
it
seemed
so
explanatory
i
am
glad
i
said
to
myself
that
i
am
a
member
i
am
sure
the
masons
have
no
such
benefits
to
offer
in
their
lodges
as
we
have
in
ours
and
we
do
not
require
money
of
farmers
who
have
little
to
pay
we
will
accept
corn
or
hen
eggs
or
a
sandwich
at
the
door
and
as
for
a
cheerful
glance
of
the
eye
it
is
for
us
the
best
of
minted
coin
item
to
remember
when
a
man
asks
money
for
any
good
thing
beware
of
it
you
can
get
a
better
for
nothing
i
can
not
undertake
to
tell
where
the
amusing
reflections
which
grew
out
of
my
idea
would
finally
have
led
me
if
i
had
not
been
interrupted
just
as
i
approached
the
patterson
farm
near
the
bridge
which
crosses
the
creek
i
saw
a
loaded
wagon
standing
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
ahead
the
horses
seemed
to
have
been
unhooked
for
the
tongue
was
down
and
a
man
was
on
his
knees
between
the
front
wheels
involuntarily
i
said
another
member
of
my
society
and
in
distress
i
had
a
heart
at
that
moment
for
anything
i
felt
like
some
old
neighbourly
knight
travelling
the
earth
in
search
of
adventure
if
there
had
been
a
distressed
mistress
handy
at
that
moment
i
feel
quite
certain
i
could
have
died
for
her
if
absolutely
necessary
as
i
drove
alongside
the
stocky
stout
lad
of
a
farmer
in
his
brown
duck
coat
lined
with
sheep
wool
came
up
from
between
the
wheels
his
cap
was
awry
his
trousers
were
muddy
at
the
knees
where
he
had
knelt
in
the
moist
road
and
his
face
was
red
and
angry
a
true
knight
i
thought
to
myself
looks
not
to
the
beauty
of
his
lady
but
only
to
her
distress
what
the
matter
brother
i
asked
in
the
friendliest
manner
bolt
gone
he
said
gruffly
and
i
got
to
get
to
town
before
nightfall
get
in
i
said
and
we
drive
back
we
shall
see
it
in
the
road
so
he
got
in
i
drove
the
mare
slowly
up
the
hill
and
we
both
leaned
out
and
looked
and
presently
there
in
the
road
the
bolt
lay
my
farmer
got
out
and
picked
it
up
it
all
right
he
said
i
was
afraid
it
was
clean
busted
obliged
to
you
for
the
lift
hold
on
i
said
get
in
i
take
you
back
oh
i
can
walk
but
i
can
drive
you
faster
i
said
and
you
got
to
get
the
load
to
town
before
nightfall
i
could
not
let
him
go
without
taking
tribute
no
matter
what
the
story
books
say
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
no
gentle
knight
who
was
human
ever
parted
with
the
fair
lady
whose
misery
he
had
relieved
without
exchanging
the
time
of
day
or
offering
her
a
bun
from
his
dinner
pail
or
finding
out
for
instance
if
she
were
maid
or
married
my
farmer
laughed
and
got
in
you
see
i
said
when
a
member
of
my
society
is
in
distress
i
always
like
to
help
him
out
he
paused
i
watched
him
gradually
evolve
his
reply
how
did
you
know
i
was
a
mason
well
i
was
i
only
joined
last
winter
he
said
i
like
it
when
a
mason
you
find
friends
everywhere
i
had
some
excellent
remarks
that
i
could
have
made
at
this
point
but
the
distance
was
short
and
bolts
were
irresistibly
uppermost
after
helping
him
to
put
in
the
bolt
i
said
here
the
grip
of
fellowship
he
returned
it
with
a
will
but
afterward
he
said
doubtfully
i
did
feel
the
grip
did
you
i
asked
well
brother
it
was
all
there
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
he
said
just
you
let
me
know
name
forbes
spring
brook
and
so
he
drove
away
a
real
mason
i
said
to
myself
could
not
have
had
any
better
advantage
of
his
society
at
this
moment
than
i
walked
right
into
it
without
a
grip
or
a
pass
and
benefits
have
also
been
distributed
as
i
drove
onward
i
felt
as
though
anything
might
happen
to
me
before
i
got
home
i
know
now
exactly
how
all
old
knights
all
voyageurs
all
crusaders
all
poets
in
new
places
must
have
felt
i
looked
out
at
every
turn
of
the
road
and
finally
after
i
had
grown
almost
discouraged
of
encountering
further
adventure
i
saw
a
man
walking
in
the
road
ahead
of
me
he
was
much
bent
over
and
carried
on
his
back
a
bag
when
he
heard
me
coming
he
stepped
out
of
the
road
and
stood
silent
saving
every
unnecessary
motion
as
a
weary
man
will
he
neither
looked
around
nor
spoke
but
waited
for
me
to
go
by
he
was
weary
past
expectation
i
stopped
the
mare
get
in
brother
i
said
i
am
going
your
way
he
looked
at
me
doubtfully
then
as
i
moved
to
one
side
he
let
his
bag
roll
off
his
back
into
his
arms
i
could
see
the
swollen
veins
of
his
neck
his
face
had
the
drawn
look
of
the
man
who
bears
burdens
pretty
heavy
for
your
buggy
he
remarked
heavier
for
you
i
replied
so
he
put
the
bag
in
the
back
of
my
buggy
and
stepped
in
beside
me
diffidently
pull
up
the
lap
robe
i
said
and
be
comfortable
well
sir
i
glad
of
a
lift
he
remarked
a
bag
of
seed
wheat
is
about
all
a
man
wants
to
carry
for
four
miles
are
you
the
man
who
has
taken
the
old
rucker
farm
i
asked
i
that
man
i
been
intending
to
drop
in
and
see
you
i
said
have
you
he
asked
eagerly
yes
i
said
i
live
just
across
the
hills
from
you
and
i
had
a
notion
that
we
ought
to
be
neighbourly
seeing
that
we
belong
to
the
same
society
his
face
which
had
worn
a
look
of
set
discouragement
he
did
know
beforehand
what
the
rucker
place
was
like
had
brightened
up
but
when
i
spoke
of
the
society
it
clouded
again
you
must
be
mistaken
he
said
i
not
a
mason
no
more
am
i
i
said
nor
an
oddfellow
nor
i
as
i
looked
at
the
man
i
seemed
to
know
all
about
him
some
people
come
to
us
like
that
all
at
once
opening
out
to
some
unsuspected
key
his
face
bore
not
a
few
marks
of
refinement
though
work
and
discouragement
had
done
their
best
to
obliterate
them
his
nose
was
thin
and
high
his
eye
was
blue
too
blue
and
his
chin
somehow
did
not
go
with
the
rucker
farm
i
knew
a
man
who
in
his
time
had
seen
many
an
open
door
but
who
had
found
them
all
closed
when
he
attempted
to
enter
if
any
one
ever
needed
the
benefits
of
my
fraternity
he
was
that
man
what
society
did
you
think
i
belonged
to
he
asked
well
i
said
when
i
was
in
town
a
man
who
wanted
to
sell
me
a
asked
me
if
i
was
a
mason
did
he
ask
you
that
too
interrupted
my
companion
he
did
i
said
he
did
and
i
reflected
not
without
enthusiasm
that
i
had
come
away
without
a
and
when
i
drove
out
of
town
i
was
feeling
rather
depressed
because
i
was
a
member
of
the
lodge
were
you
exclaimed
my
companion
so
was
i
just
felt
as
though
i
had
about
reached
the
last
ditch
i
have
any
money
to
pay
into
lodges
and
it
do
seems
if
a
man
could
get
acquainted
and
friendly
without
farming
is
rather
lonely
work
sometimes
is
it
i
observed
you
bet
it
is
he
responded
you
been
there
yourself
you
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
the
friendship
of
prosperity
but
surely
it
can
not
be
compared
with
the
friendship
of
adversity
men
stooping
come
close
together
but
when
i
got
to
thinking
it
over
i
said
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
belonged
to
the
greatest
of
all
fraternities
and
i
recognized
you
instantly
as
a
charter
member
he
looked
around
at
me
expectantly
half
laughing
i
do
suppose
he
had
so
far
forgotten
his
miseries
for
many
a
day
what
that
he
asked
the
universal
brotherhood
of
men
well
we
both
laughed
and
understood
after
that
what
a
story
he
told
me
the
story
of
a
misplaced
man
on
an
unproductive
farm
is
it
not
marvellous
how
full
people
are
all
people
of
humour
tragedy
passionate
human
longings
hopes
fears
if
only
you
can
unloosen
the
floodgates
as
to
my
companion
he
had
been
growing
bitter
and
sickly
with
the
humours
of
discouragement
all
he
needed
was
a
listener
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
talk
that
he
did
not
at
first
realize
that
we
had
turned
into
his
own
long
lane
when
he
discovered
it
he
exclaimed
i
did
mean
to
bring
you
out
of
your
way
i
can
manage
the
bag
all
right
now
never
mind
i
said
i
want
to
get
you
home
to
say
nothing
of
hearing
how
you
came
out
with
your
pigs
as
we
approached
the
house
a
woman
came
to
the
door
my
companion
sprang
out
of
the
buggy
as
much
elated
now
as
he
had
previously
been
depressed
for
that
was
the
coinage
of
his
temperament
rushed
up
to
his
wife
and
led
her
down
to
the
gate
she
was
evidently
astonished
at
his
enthusiasm
i
suppose
she
thought
he
had
at
length
discovered
his
gold
mine
when
i
finally
turned
the
mare
around
he
stopped
me
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
in
a
confidential
voice
i
glad
we
discovered
that
we
belong
to
the
same
society
as
i
drove
away
i
could
not
help
chuckling
when
i
heard
his
wife
ask
suspiciously
what
society
is
that
i
heard
no
word
of
his
answer
only
the
note
in
his
voice
of
eager
explanation
and
so
i
drove
homeward
in
the
late
twilight
and
as
i
came
up
the
lane
the
door
of
my
home
opened
the
light
within
gleamed
kindly
and
warmly
across
the
darkened
yard
and
harriet
was
there
on
the
step
waiting
ii
a
day
of
pleasant
bread
they
have
all
gone
now
and
the
house
is
very
still
for
the
first
time
this
evening
i
can
hear
the
familiar
sound
of
the
december
wind
blustering
about
the
house
complaining
at
closed
doorways
asking
questions
at
the
shutters
but
here
in
my
room
under
the
green
reading
lamp
it
is
warm
and
still
although
harriet
has
closed
the
doors
covered
the
coals
in
the
fireplace
and
said
the
atmosphere
still
seems
to
tingle
with
the
electricity
of
genial
humanity
the
parting
voice
of
the
scotch
preacher
still
booms
in
my
ears
this
said
he
as
he
was
going
out
of
our
door
wrapped
like
an
arctic
highlander
in
cloaks
and
tippets
has
been
a
day
of
pleasant
bread
one
of
the
very
pleasantest
i
can
remember
i
sometimes
think
we
expect
too
much
of
christmas
day
we
try
to
crowd
into
it
the
long
arrears
of
kindliness
and
humanity
of
the
whole
year
as
for
me
i
like
to
take
my
christmas
a
little
at
a
time
all
through
the
year
and
thus
i
drift
along
into
the
holidays
let
them
overtake
me
unexpectedly
waking
up
some
fine
morning
and
suddenly
saying
to
myself
why
this
is
christmas
day
how
the
discovery
makes
one
bound
out
of
his
bed
what
a
new
sense
of
life
and
adventure
it
imparts
almost
anything
may
happen
on
a
day
like
this
one
thinks
i
may
meet
friends
i
have
not
seen
before
in
years
who
knows
i
may
discover
that
this
is
a
far
better
and
kindlier
world
than
i
had
ever
dreamed
it
could
be
illustration
merry
christmas
harriet
so
i
sing
out
to
harriet
as
i
go
down
merry
christmas
harriet
and
not
waiting
for
her
sleepy
reply
i
go
down
and
build
the
biggest
warmest
friendliest
fire
of
the
year
then
i
get
into
my
thick
coat
and
mittens
and
open
the
back
door
all
around
the
sill
deep
on
the
step
and
all
about
the
yard
lies
the
drifted
snow
it
has
transformed
my
wood
pile
into
a
grotesque
indian
mound
and
it
frosts
the
roof
of
my
barn
like
a
wedding
cake
i
go
at
it
lustily
with
my
wooden
shovel
clearing
out
a
pathway
to
the
gate
cold
too
one
of
the
coldest
mornings
we
had
but
clear
and
very
still
the
sun
is
just
coming
up
over
the
hill
near
horace
farm
from
horace
chimney
the
white
of
an
early
fire
rises
straight
upward
all
golden
with
sunshine
into
the
measureless
blue
of
the
sky
on
its
way
to
heaven
for
aught
i
know
when
i
reach
the
gate
my
blood
is
racing
warmly
in
my
veins
i
straighten
my
back
thrust
my
shovel
into
the
snow
pile
and
shout
at
the
top
of
my
voice
for
i
can
no
longer
contain
myself
merry
christmas
harriet
harriet
opens
the
door
just
a
crack
merry
christmas
yourself
you
arctic
explorer
oo
but
it
cold
and
she
closes
the
door
upon
hearing
these
riotous
sounds
the
barnyard
suddenly
awakens
i
hear
my
horse
whinnying
from
the
barn
the
chickens
begin
to
crow
and
cackle
and
such
a
grunting
and
squealing
as
the
pigs
set
up
from
behind
the
straw
stack
it
would
do
a
man
heart
good
to
hear
it
a
friendly
world
i
say
to
myself
and
full
of
business
i
plow
through
the
snow
to
the
stable
door
i
scuff
and
stamp
the
snow
away
and
pull
it
open
with
difficulty
a
cloud
of
steam
arises
out
of
the
warmth
within
i
step
inside
my
horse
raises
his
head
above
the
stanchion
looks
around
at
me
and
strikes
his
forefoot
on
the
stable
floor
the
best
greeting
he
has
at
his
command
for
a
fine
christmas
morning
my
cow
until
now
silent
begins
to
bawl
i
lay
my
hand
on
the
horse
flank
and
he
steps
over
in
his
stall
to
let
me
go
by
i
slap
his
neck
and
he
lays
back
his
ears
playfully
thus
i
go
out
into
the
passageway
and
give
my
horse
his
oats
throw
corn
and
stalks
to
the
pigs
and
a
handful
of
grain
to
harriet
chickens
the
only
way
to
stop
the
cackling
and
thus
presently
the
barnyard
is
quiet
again
except
for
the
sound
of
contented
feeding
take
my
word
for
it
this
is
one
of
the
pleasant
moments
of
life
i
stand
and
look
long
at
my
barnyard
family
i
observe
with
satisfaction
how
plump
they
are
and
how
well
they
are
bearing
the
winter
then
i
look
up
at
my
mountainous
straw
stack
with
its
capping
of
snow
and
my
corn
crib
with
the
yellow
ears
visible
through
the
slats
and
my
barn
with
its
mow
full
of
hay
all
the
gatherings
of
the
year
now
being
expended
in
growth
i
can
not
at
all
explain
it
but
at
such
moments
the
circuit
of
that
dim
spiritual
battery
which
each
of
us
conceals
within
seems
to
close
and
the
full
current
of
contentment
flows
through
our
lives
all
the
morning
as
i
went
about
my
chores
i
had
a
peculiar
sense
of
expected
pleasure
it
seemed
certain
to
me
that
something
unusual
and
adventurous
was
about
to
happen
and
if
it
did
not
happen
offhand
why
i
was
there
to
make
it
happen
when
i
went
in
to
breakfast
do
you
know
the
fragrance
of
broiling
bacon
when
you
have
worked
for
an
hour
before
breakfast
on
a
morning
of
zero
weather
if
you
do
not
consider
that
heaven
still
has
gifts
in
store
for
you
when
i
went
in
to
breakfast
i
fancied
that
harriet
looked
preoccupied
but
i
was
too
busy
just
then
hot
corn
muffins
to
make
an
inquiry
and
i
knew
by
experience
that
the
best
solvent
of
secrecy
is
patience
david
said
harriet
presently
the
cousins
ca
come
ca
come
i
exclaimed
why
you
act
as
if
you
were
delighted
no
well
yes
i
said
i
knew
that
some
extraordinary
adventure
was
about
to
happen
adventure
it
a
cruel
disappointment
i
was
all
ready
for
them
harriet
i
said
adventure
is
just
what
we
make
it
and
are
we
to
have
the
scotch
preacher
and
his
wife
but
i
got
such
a
dinner
well
i
said
there
are
no
two
ways
about
it
it
must
be
eaten
you
may
depend
upon
me
to
do
my
duty
we
have
to
send
out
into
the
highways
and
compel
them
to
come
in
said
harriet
ruefully
i
had
several
choice
observations
i
should
have
liked
to
make
upon
this
problem
but
harriet
was
plainly
not
listening
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
reflectively
on
the
coffeepot
i
watched
her
for
a
moment
then
i
remarked
there
are
any
david
she
exclaimed
how
did
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
about
i
merely
wanted
to
show
you
i
said
that
my
genius
is
not
properly
appreciated
in
my
own
household
you
thought
of
highways
did
you
then
you
thought
of
the
poor
especially
the
poor
on
christmas
day
then
of
heney
who
is
poor
any
more
having
married
john
daniels
and
then
i
said
are
any
harriet
laughed
it
has
come
to
a
pretty
pass
she
said
when
there
are
no
poor
people
to
invite
to
dinner
on
christmas
day
it
a
tragedy
i
admit
i
said
but
let
be
logical
about
it
i
am
willing
said
harriet
to
be
as
logical
as
you
like
then
i
said
having
no
poor
to
invite
to
dinner
we
must
necessarily
try
the
rich
that
logical
is
it
who
asked
harriet
which
is
just
like
a
woman
whenever
you
get
a
good
healthy
argument
started
with
her
she
will
suddenly
it
and
want
to
know
if
you
mean
smith
or
joe
perkins
boys
which
i
maintain
is
logical
well
there
are
the
starkweathers
i
said
david
they
rich
are
they
yes
but
you
know
how
they
live
what
dinners
they
have
and
besides
they
probably
have
a
houseful
of
company
were
you
telling
me
the
other
day
how
many
people
who
were
really
suffering
were
too
proud
to
let
anyone
know
about
it
were
you
advising
the
necessity
of
getting
acquainted
with
people
and
finding
out
tactfully
of
course
you
made
a
point
of
tact
what
the
trouble
was
but
i
was
talking
of
people
why
should
a
rule
that
is
good
for
poor
people
be
equally
as
good
for
rich
people
are
they
proud
oh
you
can
argue
observed
harriet
and
i
can
act
too
i
said
i
am
now
going
over
to
invite
the
starkweathers
i
heard
a
rumor
that
their
cook
has
left
them
and
i
expect
to
find
them
starving
in
their
parlour
of
course
they
be
very
haughty
and
proud
but
i
be
tactful
and
when
i
go
away
i
casually
leave
a
diamond
tiara
in
the
front
hall
what
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
christmas
i
said
i
ca
tell
how
pleased
i
was
with
the
enterprise
i
had
in
mind
it
suggested
all
sorts
of
amusing
and
surprising
developments
moreover
i
left
harriet
finally
in
the
breeziest
of
spirits
having
quite
forgotten
her
disappointment
over
the
of
the
cousins
if
you
get
the
starkweathers
the
bright
lexicon
of
youth
i
observed
is
no
such
word
as
fail
so
i
set
off
up
the
town
road
a
team
or
two
had
already
been
that
way
and
had
broken
a
track
through
the
snow
the
sun
was
now
fully
up
but
the
air
still
tingled
with
the
electricity
of
zero
weather
and
the
fields
i
have
seen
the
fields
of
june
and
the
fields
of
october
but
i
think
i
never
saw
our
countryside
hills
and
valleys
tree
spaces
and
brook
bottoms
more
enchantingly
beautiful
than
it
was
this
morning
snow
everywhere
the
fences
half
hidden
the
bridges
clogged
the
trees
laden
where
the
road
was
hard
it
squeaked
under
my
feet
and
where
it
was
soft
i
strode
through
the
drifts
and
the
air
went
to
one
head
like
wine
so
i
tramped
past
the
pattersons
the
old
man
a
grumpy
old
fellow
was
going
to
the
barn
with
a
pail
on
his
arm
merry
christmas
i
shouted
he
looked
around
at
me
wonderingly
and
did
not
reply
at
the
corners
i
met
the
newton
boys
so
wrapped
in
tippets
that
i
could
see
only
their
eyes
and
the
red
ends
of
their
small
noses
i
passed
the
house
where
there
was
a
cheerful
smoke
in
the
chimney
and
in
the
window
a
green
wreath
with
a
lively
red
bow
and
i
thought
how
happy
everyone
must
be
on
a
christmas
morning
like
this
at
the
hill
bridge
who
should
i
meet
but
the
scotch
preacher
himself
god
bless
him
well
well
david
he
exclaimed
heartily
merry
christmas
i
drew
my
face
down
and
said
solemnly
mcalway
i
am
on
a
most
serious
errand
why
now
what
the
matter
he
was
all
sympathy
at
once
i
am
out
in
the
highways
trying
to
compel
the
poor
of
this
neighbourhood
to
come
to
our
feast
the
scotch
preacher
observed
me
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
david
he
said
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
as
if
to
speak
in
my
ear
there
is
a
poor
man
you
will
na
have
to
compel
oh
you
do
count
i
said
you
coming
anyhow
then
i
told
him
of
the
errand
with
our
millionaire
friends
into
the
spirit
of
which
he
entered
with
the
greatest
zest
he
was
full
of
advice
and
much
excited
lest
i
fail
to
do
a
thoroughly
competent
job
for
a
moment
i
think
he
wanted
to
take
the
whole
thing
out
of
my
hands
man
man
it
a
lovely
thing
to
do
he
exclaimed
but
i
ha
me
doots
i
ha
me
doots
at
parting
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
with
a
serious
face
inquired
is
it
by
any
chance
a
goose
it
is
i
said
a
goose
a
big
one
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
complete
satisfaction
you
have
comforted
my
mind
he
said
with
the
joys
of
anticipation
a
goose
a
big
goose
so
i
left
him
and
went
onward
toward
the
starkweathers
presently
i
saw
the
great
house
standing
among
its
wintry
trees
there
was
smoke
in
the
chimney
but
no
other
evidence
of
life
at
the
gate
my
spirits
which
had
been
of
the
best
all
the
morning
began
to
fail
me
though
harriet
and
i
were
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
starkweathers
yet
at
this
late
moment
on
christmas
morning
it
did
seem
rather
a
scheme
to
think
of
inviting
them
to
dinner
never
mind
i
said
they
not
be
displeased
to
see
me
anyway
i
waited
in
the
which
was
cold
and
felt
damp
in
the
parlour
beyond
i
could
see
the
innumerable
things
of
beauty
furniture
pictures
books
so
very
very
much
of
everything
with
which
the
room
was
filled
i
saw
it
now
as
i
had
often
seen
it
before
with
a
peculiar
sense
of
weariness
how
all
these
things
though
beautiful
enough
in
themselves
must
clutter
up
a
man
life
do
you
know
the
more
i
look
into
life
the
more
things
it
seems
to
me
i
can
successfully
lack
and
continue
to
grow
happier
how
many
kinds
of
food
i
do
not
need
nor
cooks
to
cook
them
how
much
curious
clothing
nor
tailors
to
make
it
how
many
books
that
i
never
read
and
pictures
that
are
not
worth
while
the
farther
i
run
the
more
i
feel
like
casting
aside
all
such
impedimenta
lest
i
fail
to
arrive
at
the
far
goal
of
my
endeavour
i
like
to
think
of
an
old
japanese
nobleman
i
once
read
about
who
ornamented
his
house
with
a
single
vase
at
a
time
living
with
it
absorbing
its
message
of
beauty
and
when
he
tired
of
it
replacing
it
with
another
i
wonder
if
he
had
the
right
way
and
we
with
so
many
objects
to
hang
on
our
walls
place
on
our
shelves
drape
on
our
chairs
and
spread
on
our
floors
have
mistaken
our
course
and
placed
our
hearts
upon
the
multiplicity
rather
than
the
quality
of
our
possessions
presently
starkweather
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
wore
a
velvet
and
slippers
and
somehow
for
a
bright
morning
like
this
he
seemed
old
and
worn
and
cold
well
well
friend
he
said
i
glad
to
see
you
he
said
it
as
though
he
meant
it
come
into
the
library
it
the
only
room
in
the
whole
house
that
is
comfortably
warm
you
no
idea
what
a
task
it
is
to
heat
a
place
like
this
in
really
cold
weather
no
sooner
do
i
find
a
man
who
can
run
my
furnace
than
he
goes
off
and
leaves
me
i
can
sympathize
with
you
i
said
we
often
have
trouble
at
our
house
with
the
man
who
builds
the
fires
he
looked
around
at
me
quizzically
he
lies
too
long
in
bed
in
the
morning
i
said
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
library
where
a
bright
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
it
was
a
fine
big
room
with
dark
oak
furnishings
and
books
in
cases
along
one
wall
but
this
morning
it
had
a
dishevelled
and
untidy
look
on
a
little
table
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
were
the
remains
of
a
breakfast
at
the
other
a
number
of
wraps
were
thrown
carelessly
upon
a
chair
as
i
came
in
starkweather
rose
from
her
place
drawing
a
silk
scarf
around
her
shoulders
she
is
a
robust
rather
handsome
woman
with
many
rings
on
her
fingers
and
a
pair
of
glasses
hanging
to
a
little
gold
hook
on
her
ample
bosom
but
this
morning
she
too
looked
worried
and
old
oh
yes
she
said
with
a
rueful
laugh
we
beginning
a
merry
christmas
as
you
see
think
of
christmas
with
no
cook
in
the
house
i
felt
as
if
i
had
discovered
a
gold
mine
poor
starving
millionaires
but
starkweather
had
not
told
the
whole
of
her
sorrowful
story
we
had
a
company
of
friends
invited
for
dinner
she
said
and
our
cook
was
ill
or
said
she
was
and
had
to
go
one
of
the
maids
went
with
her
the
man
who
looks
after
the
furnace
disappeared
on
friday
and
the
stableman
has
been
drinking
we
ca
very
well
leave
the
place
without
some
one
who
is
responsible
in
charge
of
it
and
so
here
we
are
merry
christmas
i
could
help
laughing
poor
people
you
might
i
said
apply
for
heney
place
who
is
mrs
heney
asked
starkweather
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
never
heard
of
mrs
heney
i
exclaimed
heney
who
is
now
daniels
you
missed
one
of
our
greatest
celebrities
with
that
of
course
i
had
to
tell
them
about
heney
who
has
for
years
performed
a
most
important
function
in
this
community
alone
and
unaided
she
has
been
the
poor
whom
we
are
supposed
to
have
always
with
us
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
devoted
faithfulness
of
heney
at
thanksgiving
christmas
and
other
times
of
the
year
i
suppose
our
woman
aid
society
and
the
king
daughters
would
have
perished
miserably
of
undistributed
turkeys
and
tufted
comforters
for
years
heney
filled
the
place
most
acceptably
curbing
the
natural
outpourings
of
a
rather
jovial
soul
she
could
upon
occasion
look
as
deserving
of
charity
as
any
person
that
ever
i
met
but
i
pitied
the
little
heneys
it
always
comes
hard
on
the
children
for
weeks
after
every
thanksgiving
and
christmas
they
always
wore
a
painfully
stuffed
and
suffocated
look
i
only
came
to
appreciate
fully
what
a
public
servant
heney
really
was
when
i
learned
that
she
had
taken
the
desperate
alternative
of
marrying
penny
daniels
so
you
think
we
might
possibly
aspire
to
the
position
laughed
starkweather
upon
this
i
told
them
of
the
trouble
in
our
household
and
asked
them
to
come
down
and
help
us
enjoy
mcalway
and
the
goose
when
i
left
after
much
more
pleasant
talk
they
both
came
with
me
to
the
door
seeming
greatly
improved
in
spirits
you
given
us
something
to
live
for
grayson
said
starkweather
so
i
walked
homeward
in
the
highest
spirits
and
an
hour
or
more
later
who
should
we
see
in
the
top
of
our
upper
field
but
starkweather
and
his
wife
floundering
in
the
snow
they
reached
the
lane
literally
covered
from
top
to
toe
with
snow
and
both
of
them
ruddy
with
the
cold
we
walked
over
said
starkweather
breathlessly
and
i
had
so
much
fun
in
years
starkweather
helped
her
over
the
fence
the
scotch
preacher
stood
on
the
steps
to
receive
them
and
we
all
went
in
together
i
ca
pretend
to
describe
harriet
dinner
the
gorgeous
brown
goose
and
the
apple
sauce
and
all
the
other
things
that
best
go
with
it
and
the
pumpkin
pie
at
the
end
the
finest
thickest
most
delicious
pumpkin
pie
i
ever
ate
in
all
my
life
it
melted
in
one
mouth
and
brought
visions
of
celestial
bliss
and
i
wish
i
could
have
a
picture
of
harriet
presiding
i
have
never
seen
her
happier
or
more
in
her
element
every
time
she
brought
in
a
new
dish
or
took
off
a
cover
it
was
a
sort
of
miracle
and
her
coffee
but
i
must
not
and
dare
not
elaborate
and
what
great
talk
we
had
afterward
i
known
the
scotch
preacher
for
a
long
time
but
i
never
saw
him
in
quite
such
a
mood
of
hilarity
he
and
starkweather
told
stories
of
their
boyhood
and
we
laughed
and
laughed
starkweather
the
most
of
all
seeing
her
so
often
in
her
carriage
or
in
the
dignity
of
her
home
i
did
think
she
had
so
much
jollity
in
her
finally
she
discovered
harriet
cabinet
organ
and
nothing
would
do
but
she
must
sing
for
us
none
of
the
ones
clara
cried
her
husband
some
of
the
old
ones
we
used
to
know
so
she
sat
herself
down
at
the
organ
and
threw
her
head
back
and
began
to
sing
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
which
i
gaze
on
so
fondly
starkweather
jumped
up
and
ran
over
to
the
organ
and
joined
in
with
his
deep
voice
harriet
and
i
followed
the
scotch
preacher
wife
nodded
in
time
with
the
music
and
presently
i
saw
the
tears
in
her
eyes
as
for
mcalway
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
wagged
his
shaggy
head
and
before
we
got
through
he
too
joined
in
with
his
big
sonorous
voice
thou
wouldst
still
be
adored
as
this
moment
thou
art
oh
i
ca
tell
here
it
grows
late
and
there
work
all
the
things
we
did
and
said
they
stayed
until
it
was
dark
and
when
starkweather
was
ready
to
go
she
took
both
of
harriet
hands
in
hers
and
said
with
great
earnestness
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
at
christmas
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
the
dear
old
scotch
preacher
when
harriet
and
i
had
wrapped
him
up
went
out
saying
this
has
been
a
day
of
pleasant
bread
it
has
it
has
i
shall
not
soon
forget
it
what
a
lot
of
kindness
and
common
human
nature
childlike
simplicity
if
you
will
there
is
in
people
once
you
get
them
down
together
and
persuade
them
that
the
things
they
think
serious
are
not
serious
at
all
iii
the
open
road
to
make
space
for
wandering
is
it
that
the
world
was
made
so
wide
goethe
i
love
sometimes
to
have
a
day
alone
a
riotous
day
sometimes
i
do
not
care
to
see
even
my
best
friends
but
i
give
myself
up
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
world
around
me
i
go
out
of
my
door
in
the
morning
preferably
a
sunny
morning
though
any
morning
will
do
well
enough
and
walk
straight
out
into
the
world
i
take
with
me
the
burden
of
no
duty
or
responsibility
i
draw
in
the
fresh
air
from
orchard
and
wood
i
look
about
me
as
if
everything
were
new
and
behold
everything
new
my
barn
my
oaks
my
fences
i
declare
i
never
saw
them
before
i
have
no
preconceived
impressions
or
beliefs
or
opinions
my
lane
fence
is
the
end
of
the
known
earth
i
am
a
discoverer
of
new
fields
among
old
ones
i
see
feel
hear
smell
taste
all
these
wonderful
things
for
the
first
time
i
have
no
idea
what
discoveries
i
shall
make
so
i
go
down
the
lane
looking
up
and
about
me
i
cross
the
town
road
and
climb
the
fence
on
the
other
side
i
brush
one
shoulder
among
the
bushes
as
i
pass
i
feel
the
solid
yet
easy
pressure
of
the
sod
the
long
blades
of
the
clasp
at
my
legs
and
let
go
with
reluctance
i
break
off
a
twig
here
and
there
and
taste
the
tart
or
bitter
sap
i
take
off
my
hat
and
let
the
warm
sun
shine
on
my
head
i
am
an
adventurer
upon
a
new
earth
is
it
not
marvellous
how
far
afield
some
of
us
are
willing
to
travel
in
pursuit
of
that
beauty
which
we
leave
behind
us
at
home
we
mistake
unfamiliarity
for
beauty
we
darken
our
perceptions
with
idle
foreignness
for
want
of
that
ardent
inner
curiosity
which
is
the
only
true
foundation
for
the
appreciation
of
beauty
for
beauty
is
inward
not
outward
we
find
ourselves
hastening
from
land
to
land
gathering
mere
curious
resemblances
which
like
unassimilated
property
possess
no
power
of
fecundation
with
what
pathetic
diligence
we
collect
peaks
and
passes
in
switzerland
how
we
come
laden
from
england
with
vain
cathedrals
beauty
what
is
it
but
a
new
way
of
approach
for
wilderness
for
foreignness
i
have
no
need
to
go
a
mile
i
have
only
to
come
up
through
my
thicket
or
cross
my
field
from
my
own
roadside
and
behold
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
things
grow
old
and
stale
not
because
they
are
old
but
because
we
cease
to
see
them
whole
vibrant
significant
worlds
around
us
disappear
within
the
sombre
mists
of
familiarity
whichever
way
we
look
the
roads
are
dull
and
barren
there
is
a
tree
at
our
gate
we
have
not
seen
in
years
a
flower
blooms
in
our
more
wonderful
than
the
shining
heights
of
the
alps
it
has
seemed
to
me
sometimes
as
though
i
could
see
men
hardening
before
my
eyes
drawing
in
a
feeler
here
walling
up
an
opening
there
naming
things
objects
fall
into
categories
for
them
and
wear
little
sure
channels
in
the
brain
a
mountain
is
a
mountain
a
tree
a
tree
to
them
a
field
forever
a
field
life
solidifies
itself
in
words
and
finally
how
everything
wearies
them
and
that
is
old
age
is
it
not
the
prime
struggle
of
life
to
keep
the
mind
plastic
to
see
and
feel
and
hear
things
newly
to
accept
nothing
as
settled
to
defend
the
eternal
right
of
the
questioner
to
reject
every
conclusion
of
yesterday
before
the
surer
observations
of
is
not
that
the
best
life
we
know
and
so
to
the
open
road
not
many
miles
from
my
farm
there
is
a
tamarack
swamp
the
soft
dark
green
of
it
fills
the
round
bowl
of
a
valley
around
it
spread
rising
forests
and
fields
fences
divide
it
from
the
known
land
coming
across
my
fields
one
day
i
saw
it
there
i
felt
the
habit
of
avoidance
it
is
a
custom
well
enough
in
a
practical
land
to
shun
such
a
spot
of
perplexity
but
on
that
day
i
was
following
the
open
road
and
it
led
me
straight
to
the
moist
dark
stillness
of
the
tamaracks
i
can
not
here
tell
all
the
marvels
i
found
in
that
place
i
trod
where
human
foot
had
never
trod
before
cobwebs
barred
my
passage
the
bars
to
most
passages
when
we
came
to
them
are
only
cobwebs
the
earth
was
soft
with
the
thick
swamp
mosses
and
with
many
an
autumn
of
fallen
dead
brown
leaves
i
crossed
the
track
of
a
muskrat
i
saw
the
nest
of
a
hawk
and
how
how
many
other
things
of
the
wilderness
i
must
not
here
relate
and
i
came
out
of
it
renewed
and
refreshed
i
know
now
the
feeling
of
the
pioneer
and
the
discoverer
peary
has
no
more
than
i
stanley
tells
me
nothing
i
have
not
experienced
what
more
than
that
is
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
inventor
poet
painter
such
can
not
abide
wildernesses
they
follow
the
open
road
they
see
for
themselves
and
will
not
accept
the
paths
or
the
names
of
the
world
and
sight
kept
clear
becomes
curiously
insight
a
thousand
had
seen
apples
fall
before
newton
but
newton
was
dowered
with
the
spirit
of
the
open
road
sometimes
as
i
walk
seeking
to
see
hear
feel
everything
newly
i
devise
secret
words
for
the
things
i
see
words
that
convey
to
me
alone
the
thought
or
impression
or
emotion
of
a
peculiar
spot
all
this
i
know
to
some
will
seem
the
acme
of
foolish
illusion
indeed
i
am
not
telling
of
it
because
it
is
practical
there
is
no
cash
at
the
end
of
it
i
am
reporting
it
as
an
experience
in
life
those
who
understand
will
understand
and
thus
out
of
my
journeys
i
have
words
which
bring
back
to
me
with
indescribable
poignancy
the
particular
impression
of
a
time
or
a
place
i
prize
them
more
highly
than
almost
any
other
of
my
possessions
for
they
come
to
me
seemingly
out
of
the
air
and
the
remembrance
of
them
enables
me
to
recall
or
live
over
a
past
experience
with
scarcely
diminished
emotion
and
one
of
these
words
how
it
brings
to
me
the
very
mood
of
a
gray
october
day
a
sleepy
west
wind
blowing
the
fields
are
bare
the
corn
shocks
brown
and
the
long
road
looks
flat
and
dull
away
in
the
marsh
i
hear
a
single
melancholy
crow
a
heavy
day
namelessly
sad
old
sorrows
flock
to
one
memory
and
old
regrets
the
creeper
is
red
in
the
swamp
and
the
grass
is
brown
on
the
hill
it
comes
to
me
that
i
was
a
boy
once
so
to
the
flat
road
and
away
and
turn
at
the
turning
and
rise
with
the
hill
will
the
mood
change
will
the
day
i
see
a
lone
man
in
the
top
of
a
pasture
crying
i
do
not
see
at
first
why
he
cries
and
then
over
the
hill
come
the
ewes
a
dense
gray
flock
of
them
huddling
toward
me
the
yokel
behind
has
a
stick
in
each
hand
he
also
cries
and
the
two
men
gathering
in
threatening
sidling
advancing
slowly
the
sheep
turning
uncertainly
this
way
and
that
come
at
last
to
the
boarded
pen
that
the
idee
says
the
helper
a
poor
lot
remarks
the
leader
such
is
the
farmer
life
from
the
roadway
they
back
their
wagon
to
the
fence
and
unhook
their
team
the
leader
throws
off
his
coat
and
stands
thick
and
muscular
in
his
blue
jeans
a
roistering
fellow
with
a
red
face
thick
neck
and
chapped
hands
i
pass
up
he
says
that
a
man
work
you
stand
in
the
wagon
and
put
in
so
he
springs
into
the
yard
and
the
sheep
huddle
close
into
the
corner
here
and
there
raising
a
timid
head
here
and
there
darting
aside
in
a
panic
hi
there
it
for
you
shouts
the
leader
and
thrusts
his
hands
deep
in
the
wool
of
one
of
the
ewes
come
up
here
you
southdown
with
the
bare
belly
says
the
man
in
the
wagon
that
my
old
game
wrastling
the
leader
remarks
struggling
with
the
next
ewe
stiddy
stiddy
now
i
got
you
up
with
you
dang
you
that
the
idee
says
the
man
in
the
wagon
so
i
watch
and
they
pass
up
the
sheep
one
by
one
and
as
i
go
down
the
road
i
hear
the
leader
thick
voice
stiddy
stiddy
and
the
response
of
the
other
that
the
idee
and
so
on
into
the
gray
day
my
open
road
leads
not
only
to
beauty
not
only
to
fresh
adventures
in
outer
observation
i
believe
in
the
open
road
in
religion
in
education
in
politics
there
is
nothing
really
settled
fenced
in
nor
finally
decided
upon
this
earth
nothing
that
is
not
questionable
i
do
not
mean
that
i
would
immediately
tear
down
fences
or
do
away
with
established
and
beaten
roads
by
no
means
the
wisdom
of
past
ages
is
likely
to
be
wiser
than
any
hasty
conclusions
of
mine
i
would
not
invite
any
other
person
to
follow
my
road
until
i
had
well
proven
it
a
better
way
toward
truth
than
that
which
time
had
established
and
yet
i
would
have
every
man
tread
the
open
road
i
would
have
him
upon
occasion
question
the
smuggest
institution
and
look
askance
upon
the
most
ancient
habit
i
would
have
him
throw
a
doubt
upon
newton
and
defy
darwin
i
would
have
him
look
straight
at
men
and
nature
with
his
own
eyes
he
should
acknowledge
no
common
gods
unless
he
proved
them
gods
for
himself
the
equality
of
men
which
we
worship
is
there
not
a
higher
inequality
the
material
progress
which
we
deify
is
it
real
progress
democracy
is
it
after
all
better
than
monarchy
i
would
have
him
question
the
canons
of
art
literature
music
morals
so
will
he
continue
young
and
useful
and
yet
sometimes
i
ask
myself
what
do
i
travel
for
why
all
this
excitement
and
eagerness
of
inquiry
what
is
it
that
i
go
forth
to
find
am
i
better
for
keeping
my
roads
open
than
my
neighbour
is
who
travels
with
contentment
the
paths
of
ancient
habit
i
am
gnawed
by
the
tooth
of
unrest
to
what
end
often
as
i
travel
i
ask
myself
that
question
and
i
have
never
had
a
convincing
answer
i
am
looking
for
something
i
can
not
find
my
open
road
is
open
too
at
the
end
what
is
it
that
drives
a
man
onward
that
scourges
him
with
unanswered
questions
we
only
know
that
we
are
driven
we
do
not
know
who
drives
we
travel
we
inquire
we
look
we
work
only
knowing
that
these
activities
satisfy
a
certain
deep
and
secret
demand
within
us
we
have
faith
that
there
is
a
reason
and
is
there
not
a
present
joy
in
following
the
open
road
and
o
the
joy
that
is
never
won
but
follows
and
follows
the
journeying
sun
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
open
road
if
we
follow
it
with
wisdom
as
well
as
fervour
will
bring
us
safely
home
again
for
after
all
the
open
road
must
return
to
the
beaten
path
the
open
road
is
for
adventure
and
adventure
is
not
the
food
of
life
but
the
spice
thus
i
came
back
this
evening
from
rioting
in
my
fields
as
i
walked
down
the
lane
i
heard
the
soft
tinkle
of
a
cowbell
a
certain
earthy
exhalation
as
of
work
came
out
of
the
bare
fields
the
duties
of
my
daily
life
crowded
upon
me
bringing
a
pleasant
calmness
of
spirit
and
i
said
to
myself
lord
be
praised
for
that
which
is
common
and
after
i
had
done
my
chores
i
came
in
hungry
to
my
supper
iv
on
being
where
you
belong
sunday
morning
may
on
friday
i
began
planting
my
corn
for
many
days
previously
i
went
out
every
morning
at
in
the
clear
sharp
air
and
thrust
my
hand
deep
down
in
the
soil
of
the
field
i
do
not
know
that
i
followed
any
learned
agricultural
rule
but
somehow
i
liked
to
do
it
it
has
seemed
reasonable
to
me
instead
of
watching
for
a
phase
of
the
moon
for
i
do
not
cultivate
the
moon
to
inquire
of
the
earth
itself
for
many
days
i
had
no
response
the
soil
was
of
an
icy
moist
coldness
as
of
death
i
am
not
ready
yet
it
said
i
have
not
rested
my
time
early
in
the
week
we
had
a
day
or
two
of
soft
sunshine
of
fecund
warmth
to
which
the
earth
lay
open
willing
passive
on
thursday
morning
though
a
white
frost
silvered
the
harrow
ridges
when
i
thrust
my
hand
into
the
soil
i
felt
or
seemed
to
feel
a
curious
response
a
strange
answering
of
life
to
life
the
stone
had
been
rolled
from
the
sepulchre
and
i
knew
then
that
the
destined
time
had
arrived
for
my
planting
that
afternoon
i
marked
out
my
driving
the
mare
to
my
wooden
marker
carefully
observant
of
the
straightness
of
the
rows
for
a
crooked
is
a
sort
of
immorality
i
brought
down
my
seed
corn
from
the
attic
where
it
had
hung
waiting
all
winter
each
ear
suspended
separately
by
the
white
husks
they
were
the
selected
ears
of
last
year
crop
even
of
size
throughout
smooth
of
kernel
with
tips
the
perfect
ones
chosen
among
many
to
perpetuate
the
highest
excellencies
of
the
crop
i
carried
them
to
the
shed
next
my
barn
and
shelled
them
out
in
my
hand
machine
as
fine
a
basket
of
yellow
dent
seed
as
a
man
ever
saw
i
have
listened
to
endless
discussions
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
flint
and
dent
corn
i
here
cast
my
vote
emphatically
for
yellow
dent
it
is
the
best
nature
can
do
i
found
my
hanging
dusty
over
a
rafter
in
the
shed
and
harriet
sewed
a
buckle
on
the
strip
that
goes
around
the
waist
i
cleaned
and
sharpened
my
hoe
now
i
said
to
myself
give
me
a
good
day
and
i
am
ready
to
plant
the
sun
was
just
coming
up
on
friday
looking
over
the
trees
into
a
world
of
misty
and
odorous
freshness
when
i
climbed
the
fence
i
dropped
down
in
the
grass
at
the
far
corner
of
the
field
i
had
looked
forward
this
year
with
pleasure
to
the
planting
of
a
small
field
by
hand
the
adventure
of
it
after
a
number
of
years
of
horse
planting
with
horace
machine
of
far
larger
fields
there
is
an
indescribable
satisfaction
in
answering
present
to
the
of
nature
to
plant
when
the
earth
is
ready
to
cultivate
when
the
soil
begins
to
bake
and
harden
to
harvest
when
the
grain
is
fully
ripe
it
is
the
chief
joy
of
him
who
lives
close
to
the
soil
that
he
comes
in
time
to
beat
in
consonance
with
the
pulse
of
the
earth
its
seasons
become
his
seasons
its
life
his
life
behold
me
then
with
a
full
suspended
before
me
buckled
both
over
the
shoulders
and
around
the
waist
a
shiny
hoe
in
my
hand
the
scepter
of
my
dominion
a
comfortable
rested
feeling
in
every
muscle
of
my
body
standing
at
the
end
of
the
first
long
furrow
there
in
my
field
on
friday
morning
a
whole
spring
day
open
before
me
at
that
moment
i
would
not
have
changed
my
place
for
the
place
of
any
king
prince
or
president
at
first
i
was
awkward
enough
for
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
done
much
hand
planting
but
i
soon
fell
into
the
rhythmic
swing
of
the
sower
the
sure
even
accurate
step
the
turn
of
the
body
and
the
flexing
of
the
wrists
as
the
hoe
strikes
downward
the
deftly
hollowed
hole
the
swing
of
the
hand
to
the
the
sure
fall
of
the
kernels
the
return
of
the
hoe
the
final
determining
pressure
of
the
soil
upon
the
seed
one
falls
into
it
and
follows
it
as
he
would
follow
the
rhythm
of
a
march
even
the
choice
of
seed
becomes
automatic
instinctive
at
first
there
is
a
conscious
counting
by
the
fingers
five
seeds
one
for
the
blackbird
one
for
the
crow
one
for
the
cutworm
two
to
grow
but
after
a
time
one
ceases
to
count
five
and
five
instinctively
rejecting
a
monstrous
six
or
returning
to
complete
an
inferior
four
i
wonder
if
you
know
the
feel
of
the
fresh
soft
soil
as
it
answers
to
your
steps
giving
a
little
responding
a
little
as
life
always
does
and
is
there
not
something
endlessly
good
and
pleasant
about
it
and
the
movement
of
the
arms
and
shoulders
falling
easily
into
that
action
and
reaction
which
yields
the
most
service
to
the
least
energy
scientists
tell
us
that
the
awkward
young
eagle
has
a
wider
than
the
old
skilled
eagle
so
the
corn
planter
at
noon
will
do
his
work
with
half
the
expended
energy
of
the
early
morning
he
attains
the
artistry
of
motion
and
quite
beyond
and
above
this
physical
accomplishment
is
the
scarcely
conscious
sense
of
reward
repayment
which
one
experiences
as
he
covers
each
planting
of
seeds
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
mists
stole
secretly
away
first
toward
the
lower
finally
disappearing
entirely
the
morning
coolness
passed
the
tops
of
the
furrows
dried
out
to
a
lighter
brown
and
still
i
followed
the
long
planting
at
each
return
i
refilled
my
and
sometimes
i
drank
from
the
jug
of
water
which
i
had
hidden
in
the
grass
often
i
stood
a
moment
by
the
fence
to
look
up
and
around
me
through
the
clear
morning
air
i
could
hear
the
roosters
crowing
vaingloriously
from
the
barnyard
and
the
robins
were
singing
and
occasionally
from
the
distant
road
i
heard
the
rumble
of
a
wagon
i
noted
the
slow
kitchen
smoke
from
horace
chimney
the
tip
of
which
i
could
just
see
over
the
hill
from
the
margin
of
my
field
and
my
own
pleasant
home
among
its
trees
and
my
barn
all
most
satisfying
to
look
upon
then
i
returned
to
the
sweat
and
heat
of
the
open
field
and
to
the
steady
swing
of
the
sowing
illustration
often
i
stood
a
moment
by
the
fence
joy
of
life
seems
to
me
to
arise
from
a
sense
of
being
where
one
belongs
as
i
feel
right
here
of
being
foursquare
with
the
life
we
have
chosen
all
the
discontented
people
i
know
are
trying
sedulously
to
be
something
they
are
not
to
do
something
they
can
not
do
in
the
advertisements
of
the
country
paper
i
find
men
angling
for
money
by
promising
to
make
women
beautiful
and
men
learned
or
rich
overnight
by
inspiring
good
farmers
and
carpenters
to
be
poor
doctors
and
lawyers
it
is
curious
is
it
not
with
what
skill
we
will
adapt
our
sandy
land
to
potatoes
and
grow
our
beans
in
clay
and
with
how
little
wisdom
we
farm
the
soils
of
our
own
natures
we
try
to
grow
poetry
where
plumbing
would
thrive
grandly
not
knowing
that
plumbing
is
as
important
and
honourable
and
necessary
to
this
earth
as
poetry
i
understand
it
perfectly
i
too
followed
long
after
false
gods
i
thought
i
must
rush
forth
to
see
the
world
i
must
forthwith
become
great
rich
famous
and
i
hurried
hither
and
thither
seeking
i
knew
not
what
consuming
my
days
with
the
infinite
distractions
of
travel
i
missed
as
one
who
attempts
two
occupations
at
once
the
sure
satisfaction
of
either
beholding
the
exteriors
of
cities
and
of
men
i
was
deceived
with
shadows
my
life
took
no
hold
upon
that
which
is
deep
and
true
colour
i
got
and
form
and
a
superficial
aptitude
in
judging
by
symbols
it
was
like
the
study
of
a
science
a
hasty
review
gives
one
the
general
rules
but
it
requires
a
far
profounder
insight
to
know
the
fertile
exceptions
but
as
i
grow
older
i
remain
here
on
my
farm
and
wait
quietly
for
the
world
to
pass
this
way
my
oak
and
i
we
wait
and
we
are
satisfied
here
we
stand
among
our
clods
our
feet
are
rooted
deep
within
the
soil
the
wind
blows
upon
us
and
delights
us
the
rain
falls
and
refreshes
us
the
sun
dries
and
sweetens
us
we
are
become
calm
slow
strong
so
we
measure
rectitudes
and
regard
essentials
my
oak
and
i
would
be
a
hard
person
to
dislodge
or
uproot
from
this
spot
of
earth
i
belong
here
i
grow
here
i
like
to
think
of
the
old
fable
of
the
wrestler
of
irassa
for
i
am
veritably
that
anteus
who
was
the
wrestler
of
irassa
and
drew
his
strength
from
the
ground
so
long
as
i
tread
the
long
furrows
of
my
planting
with
my
feet
upon
the
earth
i
am
invincible
and
unconquerable
hercules
himself
though
he
comes
upon
me
in
the
guise
of
riches
or
fame
or
power
can
not
overthrow
me
save
as
he
takes
me
away
from
this
soil
for
at
each
step
my
strength
is
renewed
i
forget
weariness
old
age
has
no
dread
for
me
some
there
may
be
who
think
i
talk
dreams
they
do
not
know
reality
my
friend
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
you
are
unhappy
because
you
have
lost
connection
with
life
because
your
feet
are
not
somewhere
firm
planted
upon
the
soil
of
reality
contentment
and
indeed
usefulness
comes
as
the
infallible
result
of
great
acceptances
great
humilities
of
not
trying
to
make
ourselves
this
or
that
to
conform
to
some
dramatized
version
of
ourselves
but
of
surrendering
ourselves
to
the
fullness
of
life
of
letting
life
flow
through
us
to
be
used
that
is
the
sublimest
thing
we
know
it
is
a
distinguishing
mark
of
greatness
that
it
has
a
tremendous
hold
upon
real
things
i
have
seen
men
who
seemed
to
have
behind
them
or
rather
within
them
whole
societies
states
institutions
how
they
come
at
us
like
atlas
bearing
the
world
for
they
act
not
with
their
own
feebleness
but
with
a
strength
as
of
the
whole
of
life
they
speak
and
the
words
are
theirs
but
the
voice
is
the
voice
of
mankind
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
being
right
with
god
or
right
with
life
it
is
strangely
the
same
thing
and
god
is
not
particular
as
to
the
name
we
know
him
by
so
long
as
we
know
him
musing
upon
these
secret
things
i
seem
to
understand
what
the
theologians
in
their
darkness
have
made
so
obscure
is
it
not
just
this
with
life
which
sweetens
and
saves
us
all
in
all
these
writings
i
have
glorified
the
life
of
the
soil
until
i
am
ashamed
i
have
loved
it
because
it
saved
me
the
farm
for
me
i
decided
long
ago
is
the
only
place
where
i
can
flow
strongly
and
surely
but
to
you
my
friend
life
may
present
a
wholly
different
aspect
variant
necessities
knowing
what
i
have
experienced
in
the
city
i
have
sometimes
wondered
at
the
happy
even
serene
faces
i
have
seen
in
crowded
streets
there
must
be
i
admit
those
who
can
flow
and
be
at
one
with
that
life
too
and
let
them
handle
their
money
and
make
shoes
and
sew
garments
and
write
in
ledgers
if
that
completes
and
contents
them
i
have
no
quarrel
with
any
one
of
them
it
is
after
all
a
big
and
various
world
where
men
can
be
happy
in
many
ways
for
every
man
is
a
magnet
highly
and
singularly
sensitized
some
draw
to
them
fields
and
woods
and
hills
and
are
drawn
in
return
and
some
draw
swift
streets
and
the
riches
which
are
known
to
cities
it
is
not
of
importance
what
we
draw
but
that
we
really
draw
and
the
greatest
tragedy
in
life
as
i
see
it
is
that
thousands
of
men
and
women
never
have
the
opportunity
to
draw
with
freedom
but
they
exist
in
weariness
and
labour
and
are
drawn
upon
like
inanimate
objects
by
those
who
live
in
unhappy
idleness
they
do
not
farm
they
are
farmed
but
that
is
a
question
foreign
to
present
considerations
we
may
be
assured
if
we
draw
freely
like
the
magnet
of
steel
which
gathers
its
iron
filings
about
it
in
beautiful
and
symmetrical
forms
that
the
things
which
we
attract
will
also
become
symmetrical
and
harmonious
with
our
lives
thus
flowing
with
life
to
life
a
man
becomes
indispensable
to
life
he
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
conduct
of
this
universe
and
it
is
the
feeling
of
being
necessary
of
being
desired
flowing
into
a
man
that
produces
the
satisfaction
of
contentment
often
and
often
i
think
to
myself
these
fields
have
need
of
me
my
horse
whinnies
when
he
hears
my
step
my
dog
barks
a
welcome
these
my
neighbours
are
glad
of
me
the
corn
comes
up
fresh
and
green
to
my
planting
my
buckwheat
bears
richly
i
am
indispensable
in
this
place
what
is
more
satisfactory
to
the
human
heart
than
to
be
needed
and
to
know
we
are
needed
one
line
in
the
book
of
chronicles
when
i
read
it
flies
up
at
me
out
of
the
printed
page
as
though
it
were
alive
conveying
newly
the
agony
of
a
misplaced
man
after
relating
the
short
and
evil
history
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
the
account
ends
with
the
appalling
terseness
which
often
crowns
the
dramatic
climaxes
of
that
matchless
writing
and
he
departed
without
being
desired
without
being
desired
i
have
wondered
if
any
man
was
ever
cursed
with
a
more
terrible
epitaph
and
so
i
planted
my
corn
and
in
the
evening
i
felt
the
dumb
weariness
of
physical
toil
many
times
in
older
days
i
have
known
the
wakeful
of
cities
this
was
not
it
it
was
the
weariness
which
after
supper
seizes
upon
one
limbs
with
numbness
i
sat
down
on
my
porch
with
a
nameless
content
i
looked
off
across
the
countryside
i
saw
the
evening
shadows
fall
and
the
moon
come
up
and
i
wanted
nothing
i
had
not
and
finally
sleep
swept
in
resistless
waves
upon
me
and
i
stumbled
up
to
bed
and
sank
into
dreamless
slumber
v
the
story
of
anna
it
is
the
prime
secret
of
the
open
road
but
i
may
here
tell
it
aloud
that
you
are
to
pass
nothing
reject
nothing
despise
nothing
upon
this
earth
as
you
travel
many
things
both
great
and
small
will
come
to
your
attention
you
are
to
regard
all
with
open
eyes
and
a
heart
of
simplicity
believe
that
everything
belongs
somewhere
each
thing
has
its
fitting
and
luminous
place
within
this
mosaic
of
human
life
the
true
road
is
not
open
to
those
who
withdraw
the
skirts
of
intolerance
or
lift
the
chin
of
pride
rejecting
the
least
of
those
who
are
called
common
or
unclean
it
is
curiously
you
yourself
that
you
reject
if
you
despise
that
which
is
ugly
you
do
not
know
that
which
is
beautiful
for
what
is
beauty
but
completeness
the
roadside
beggar
belongs
here
too
and
the
idiot
boy
who
wanders
idly
in
the
open
fields
and
the
girl
who
withholds
secretly
the
name
of
the
father
of
her
child
i
remember
as
distinctly
as
though
it
happened
yesterday
the
particular
evening
three
years
ago
when
i
saw
the
scotch
preacher
come
hurrying
up
the
road
toward
my
house
it
was
june
i
had
come
out
after
supper
to
sit
on
my
porch
and
look
out
upon
the
quiet
fields
i
remember
the
grateful
cool
of
the
evening
air
and
the
scents
rising
all
about
me
from
garden
and
roadway
and
orchard
i
was
tired
after
the
work
of
the
day
and
sat
with
a
sort
of
complete
comfort
and
contentment
which
comes
only
to
those
who
work
long
in
the
quiet
of
outdoor
places
i
remember
the
thought
came
to
me
as
it
has
come
in
various
forms
so
many
times
that
in
such
a
big
and
beautiful
world
there
should
be
no
room
for
the
fever
of
unhappiness
or
discontent
and
then
i
saw
mcalway
coming
up
the
road
i
knew
instantly
that
something
was
wrong
his
step
usually
so
deliberate
was
rapid
there
was
agitation
in
every
line
of
his
countenance
i
walked
down
through
the
garden
to
the
gate
and
met
him
there
being
somewhat
out
of
breath
he
did
not
speak
at
once
so
i
said
it
is
not
after
all
as
bad
as
you
anticipate
david
he
said
and
i
think
i
never
heard
him
speak
more
seriously
it
is
bad
enough
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
can
you
hitch
up
your
horse
and
come
with
me
right
away
mcalway
helped
with
the
buckles
and
said
not
a
word
in
ten
minutes
certainly
not
more
we
were
driving
together
down
the
lane
do
you
know
a
family
named
williams
living
on
the
north
road
beyond
the
three
corners
asked
the
scotch
preacher
instantly
a
vision
of
a
somewhat
dilapidated
house
standing
not
unpicturesquely
among
fields
leaped
to
my
mind
yes
i
said
but
i
ca
remember
any
of
the
family
except
a
gingham
girl
with
yellow
hair
i
used
to
see
her
on
her
way
to
school
a
girl
he
said
with
a
curious
note
in
his
voice
but
a
woman
now
he
paused
a
moment
then
he
continued
sadly
as
i
grow
older
it
seems
a
shorter
and
shorter
step
between
child
and
child
david
she
has
a
child
of
her
own
but
i
did
know
she
is
a
woods
child
said
the
scotch
preacher
i
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
i
remember
the
hush
of
the
evening
there
in
the
country
road
the
soft
light
fading
in
the
fields
i
heard
a
whippoorwill
calling
from
the
distant
woods
they
made
it
hard
for
her
said
the
scotch
preacher
especially
her
older
brother
about
four
this
afternoon
she
ran
away
taking
her
baby
with
her
they
found
a
note
saying
they
would
never
again
see
her
alive
her
mother
says
she
went
toward
the
river
i
touched
up
the
mare
for
a
few
minutes
the
scotch
preacher
sat
silent
thinking
then
he
said
with
a
peculiar
tone
of
kindness
in
his
voice
she
was
a
child
just
a
child
when
i
talked
with
her
yesterday
she
was
perfectly
docile
and
apparently
contented
i
can
not
imagine
her
driven
to
such
a
deed
of
desperation
i
asked
her
did
you
do
it
anna
she
answered
do
know
i
i
do
know
her
reply
was
not
defiant
or
remorseful
it
was
merely
explanatory
he
remained
silent
again
for
a
long
time
david
he
said
finally
i
sometimes
think
we
do
know
half
as
much
about
human
nature
as
we
we
preach
if
we
did
i
think
we
be
more
careful
in
our
judgments
he
said
it
slowly
tentatively
i
knew
it
came
straight
from
his
heart
it
was
this
spirit
more
than
the
title
he
bore
far
more
than
the
sermons
he
preached
that
made
him
in
reality
the
minister
of
our
community
he
went
about
thinking
that
after
all
he
did
know
much
and
that
therefore
he
must
be
kind
as
i
drove
up
to
the
bridge
the
scotch
preacher
put
one
hand
on
the
reins
i
stopped
the
horse
on
the
embankment
and
we
both
stepped
out
she
would
undoubtedly
have
come
down
this
road
to
the
river
mcalway
said
in
a
low
voice
it
was
growing
dark
when
i
walked
out
on
the
bridge
my
legs
were
strangely
unsteady
a
weight
seemed
pressing
on
my
breast
so
that
my
breath
came
hard
we
looked
down
into
the
shallow
placid
water
the
calm
of
the
evening
was
upon
it
the
middle
of
the
stream
was
like
a
rumpled
glassy
ribbon
but
the
edges
by
overhanging
trees
were
of
a
mysterious
darkness
in
all
my
life
i
think
i
never
experienced
such
a
degree
of
silence
of
breathless
oppressive
silence
it
seemed
as
if
at
any
instant
it
must
burst
into
some
fearful
excess
of
sound
suddenly
we
heard
a
voice
in
exclamation
i
turned
every
nerve
strained
to
the
uttermost
a
figure
seemingly
materialized
out
of
darkness
and
silence
was
moving
on
the
bridge
oh
mcalway
a
voice
said
then
i
heard
the
scotch
preacher
in
low
tones
have
you
seen
anna
williams
she
is
at
the
house
answered
the
voice
get
your
horse
said
the
scotch
preacher
i
ran
back
and
led
the
mare
across
the
bridge
how
i
remember
in
that
silence
the
thunder
of
her
hoofs
on
the
loose
boards
just
at
the
top
of
the
little
hill
leading
up
from
the
bridge
the
two
men
turned
in
at
a
gate
i
followed
quickly
and
the
three
of
us
entered
the
house
together
i
remember
the
musty
warm
odour
of
the
front
room
i
heard
the
faint
cry
of
a
child
the
room
was
dim
with
a
single
kerosene
lamp
but
i
saw
three
women
huddled
by
the
stove
in
which
a
new
fire
was
blazing
two
looked
up
as
we
entered
with
feminine
instinct
moving
aside
to
hide
the
form
of
the
third
she
all
right
as
soon
as
she
gets
dry
one
of
them
said
the
other
woman
turned
to
us
half
complainingly
she
ai
said
a
single
word
since
we
got
her
in
here
and
she
let
go
of
the
baby
for
a
minute
she
do
cry
said
the
other
but
just
sits
there
like
a
statue
mcalway
stepped
forward
and
said
well
anna
the
girl
looked
up
for
the
first
time
the
light
shone
full
in
her
face
a
look
i
shall
never
forget
yes
it
was
the
girl
i
had
seen
so
often
and
yet
not
the
girl
it
was
the
same
childish
face
but
all
marked
upon
with
inexplicable
wan
lines
of
a
certain
mysterious
womanhood
it
was
childish
but
bearing
upon
it
an
inexpressible
look
of
dignity
that
stirred
a
man
heart
to
its
profoundest
depths
and
there
was
in
it
too
as
i
have
thought
since
a
something
i
have
seen
in
the
faces
of
old
wise
men
a
light
how
shall
i
explain
it
as
of
experience
of
boundless
experience
her
hair
hung
in
wavy
dishevelment
about
her
head
and
shoulders
and
she
clung
passionately
to
the
child
in
her
arms
the
scotch
preacher
had
said
well
anna
she
looked
up
and
replied
they
were
going
to
take
my
baby
away
were
they
exclaimed
mcalway
in
his
hearty
voice
well
we
never
permit
who
got
a
better
right
to
the
baby
than
you
i
like
to
know
without
turning
her
head
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
rolled
unheeded
down
her
face
yes
sir
mcalway
the
man
said
i
was
coming
across
the
bridge
with
the
cows
when
i
see
her
standing
there
in
the
water
her
skirts
all
floating
around
her
she
was
hugging
the
baby
up
to
her
face
and
saying
over
and
over
just
like
this
do
dare
oh
i
do
dare
but
i
must
i
must
she
was
sort
of
singin
the
words
do
dare
i
dare
but
i
must
i
jumped
the
railing
and
run
down
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
i
says
right
out
o
there
and
she
turned
and
come
out
just
as
gentle
as
a
child
and
i
brought
her
up
here
to
the
house
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
at
this
time
that
i
should
take
the
girl
and
her
child
home
to
harriet
she
would
not
go
back
to
her
own
home
though
we
tried
to
persuade
her
and
the
scotch
preacher
wife
was
visiting
in
the
city
so
she
could
not
go
there
but
after
i
found
myself
driving
homeward
with
the
girl
while
mcalway
went
over
the
hill
to
tell
her
family
the
mood
of
action
passed
it
struck
me
suddenly
what
will
harriet
say
upon
which
my
heart
sank
curiously
and
refused
to
resume
its
natural
position
in
the
past
i
had
brought
her
tramps
and
peddlers
and
itinerant
preachers
all
of
whom
she
had
taken
in
with
patience
but
this
i
knew
was
different
for
a
few
minutes
i
wished
devoutly
i
were
in
timbuctu
or
some
other
far
place
and
then
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
struck
me
all
at
once
and
i
could
help
laughing
aloud
it
a
tremendous
old
world
i
said
to
myself
why
anything
may
happen
anywhere
the
girl
stirred
but
did
not
speak
i
was
afraid
i
had
frightened
her
are
you
cold
i
asked
no
sir
she
answered
faintly
i
could
think
of
nothing
whatever
to
say
so
i
said
it
are
you
fond
of
hot
mush
yes
sir
very
faintly
with
cream
on
it
rich
yellow
cream
and
plenty
of
sugar
yes
sir
well
i
bet
a
nickel
that
what
we
going
to
get
yes
sir
we
drove
up
the
lane
and
stopped
at
the
yard
gate
harriet
opened
the
door
i
led
the
small
dark
figure
into
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
kitchen
she
stood
helplessly
holding
the
baby
tight
in
her
arms
as
forlorn
and
dishevelled
a
figure
as
one
could
well
imagine
harriet
i
said
this
is
anna
williams
harriet
gave
me
her
most
tremendous
look
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
moment
that
it
was
my
sister
harriet
at
all
that
i
was
facing
but
some
stranger
and
much
greater
person
than
i
had
ever
known
every
man
has
upon
occasion
beheld
his
wife
his
sister
his
mother
even
become
suddenly
unknown
suddenly
commanding
suddenly
greater
than
himself
or
any
other
man
for
a
woman
possesses
the
occult
power
of
becoming
instantly
miraculously
the
accumulated
and
personified
customs
morals
and
institutions
of
the
ages
at
this
moment
then
i
felt
myself
slowly
but
surely
shrinking
and
shriveling
up
it
is
a
most
uncomfortable
sensation
to
find
one
self
face
to
face
with
under
such
circumstances
i
always
know
what
to
do
i
run
so
i
clapped
my
hat
on
my
head
declared
that
the
mare
must
be
unharnessed
immediately
and
started
for
the
door
harriet
followed
once
outside
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
david
david
she
said
it
occurred
to
me
now
for
the
first
time
which
shows
how
stupid
i
am
that
harriet
had
already
heard
the
story
of
anna
williams
and
it
had
gained
so
much
bulk
and
robustity
in
travelling
as
such
stories
do
in
the
country
that
i
have
no
doubt
the
poor
child
seemed
a
sort
of
devastating
monster
of
iniquity
how
the
country
scourges
those
who
do
not
walk
the
beaten
path
in
the
careless
city
such
a
one
may
escape
to
unfamiliar
streets
and
consort
with
unfamiliar
people
and
still
find
a
way
of
life
but
here
in
the
country
the
eye
of
society
never
sleeps
for
a
moment
i
was
appalled
by
what
i
had
done
then
i
thought
of
the
harriet
i
knew
so
well
the
inexhaustible
heart
of
her
with
a
sudden
inspiration
i
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
we
both
looked
in
the
girl
stood
motionless
just
where
i
left
her
an
infinitely
pathetic
figure
harriet
i
said
that
girl
is
hungry
and
cold
well
it
worked
instantly
harriet
ceased
to
be
and
became
the
harriet
i
know
the
harriet
of
infinite
compassion
for
all
weak
creatures
when
she
had
gone
in
i
pulled
my
hat
down
and
went
straight
for
the
barn
i
guess
i
know
when
it
wise
to
be
absent
from
places
i
unharnessed
the
mare
and
watered
and
fed
her
i
climbed
up
into
the
loft
and
put
down
a
rackful
of
hay
i
let
the
cows
out
into
the
pasture
and
set
up
the
bars
and
then
i
stood
by
the
gate
and
looked
up
into
the
clear
june
sky
no
man
i
think
can
remain
long
silent
under
the
stars
with
the
brooding
mysterious
night
around
about
him
without
feeling
poignantly
how
little
he
understands
anything
how
inconsequential
his
actions
are
how
feeble
his
judgments
and
i
thought
as
i
stood
there
how
many
a
man
deep
down
in
his
heart
knows
to
a
certainty
that
he
has
escaped
being
an
outcast
not
because
of
any
real
moral
strength
or
resolution
of
his
own
but
because
society
has
bolstered
him
up
hedged
him
about
with
customs
and
restrictions
until
he
never
has
had
a
really
good
opportunity
to
transgress
and
some
do
not
sin
for
very
lack
of
courage
and
originality
they
are
helplessly
good
how
many
men
in
their
vanity
take
to
themselves
credit
for
the
virtues
of
men
who
are
dead
there
is
no
cause
for
surprise
when
we
hear
of
a
foremost
citizen
the
leader
in
all
good
works
suddenly
gone
wrong
not
the
least
cause
for
surprise
for
it
was
not
he
that
was
moral
but
society
individually
he
had
never
been
tested
and
when
the
test
came
he
fell
it
will
give
us
a
large
measure
of
true
wisdom
if
we
stop
sometimes
when
we
have
resisted
a
temptation
and
ask
ourselves
why
at
that
moment
we
did
right
and
not
wrong
was
it
the
deep
virtue
the
high
ideals
in
our
souls
or
was
it
the
compulsion
of
the
society
around
us
and
i
think
most
of
us
will
be
astonished
to
discover
what
fragile
persons
we
really
are
in
ourselves
i
stopped
for
several
minutes
at
the
kitchen
door
before
i
dared
to
go
in
then
i
stamped
vigorously
on
the
boards
as
if
i
had
come
rushing
up
to
the
house
without
a
doubt
in
my
mind
i
even
whistled
and
opened
the
door
jauntily
and
had
my
pains
for
nothing
the
kitchen
was
empty
but
full
of
comforting
and
homelike
odours
there
was
undoubtedly
hot
mush
in
the
kettle
a
few
minutes
later
harriet
came
down
the
stairs
she
held
up
one
finger
warningly
her
face
was
transfigured
david
she
whispered
the
baby
asleep
so
i
tiptoed
across
the
room
she
tiptoed
after
me
then
i
faced
about
and
we
both
stood
there
on
our
tiptoes
holding
our
breath
at
least
i
held
mine
david
harriet
whispered
did
you
see
the
baby
no
i
whispered
i
think
it
the
finest
baby
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
when
i
was
a
boy
and
my
who
lived
for
many
years
in
a
little
room
with
dormer
windows
at
the
top
of
my
father
house
used
to
tell
me
stories
the
best
i
ever
heard
i
was
never
content
with
the
endings
of
them
what
happened
next
i
remember
asking
a
hundred
times
and
if
i
did
not
ask
the
question
aloud
it
arose
at
least
in
my
own
mind
if
i
were
writing
fiction
i
might
go
on
almost
indefinitely
with
the
story
of
anna
but
in
real
life
stories
have
a
curious
way
of
coming
to
quick
fruition
and
withering
away
after
having
cast
the
seeds
of
their
immortality
did
you
see
the
baby
harriet
had
asked
she
said
no
word
about
anna
a
baby
had
come
into
the
world
already
the
present
was
beginning
to
draw
the
charitable
curtains
of
its
forgetfulness
across
this
simple
drama
already
harriet
and
anna
and
all
the
rest
of
us
were
beginning
to
look
to
the
finest
baby
we
ever
saw
in
all
our
lives
i
might
indeed
go
into
the
character
of
anna
and
the
whys
and
wherefores
of
her
story
but
there
is
curiously
little
that
is
strange
or
unusual
about
it
it
was
just
life
a
few
days
with
us
worked
miraculous
changes
in
the
girl
like
some
stray
kitten
brought
in
crying
from
the
cold
she
curled
herself
up
comfortably
there
in
our
home
purring
her
contentment
she
was
not
in
the
least
a
tragic
figure
though
down
deep
under
the
curves
and
dimples
of
youth
there
was
something
finally
resistant
or
obstinate
or
defiant
which
kept
its
counsel
regarding
the
past
it
is
curious
how
acquaintanceship
mitigates
our
judgments
we
classify
strangers
into
whose
careers
the
newspapers
or
our
friends
give
us
glimpses
as
bad
or
good
we
separate
humanity
into
inevitable
goathood
and
sheephood
but
upon
closer
acquaintance
a
man
comes
to
be
not
bad
but
ebenezer
smith
or
henry
jones
and
a
woman
is
not
good
but
nellie
morgan
or
arthur
cadwalader
take
it
in
our
own
cases
some
people
knowing
just
a
little
about
us
might
call
us
pretty
good
people
but
we
know
that
down
in
our
hearts
lurk
the
possibilities
if
not
the
actual
accomplishment
of
all
sorts
of
things
not
at
all
good
we
are
exceedingly
charitable
persons
toward
ourselves
and
thus
we
let
other
people
live
the
other
day
at
harriet
suggestion
i
drove
to
town
by
the
upper
road
passing
the
williams
place
the
old
lady
has
a
passion
for
hollyhocks
a
ragged
row
of
them
borders
the
dilapidated
picket
fence
behind
which
crowding
up
to
the
sociable
road
stands
the
house
as
i
drive
that
way
it
always
seems
to
look
out
at
me
like
some
worker
inviting
a
chat
about
the
weather
or
the
county
fair
hence
probably
its
dilapidation
at
the
gate
i
heard
a
voice
and
a
boy
about
three
years
old
in
a
soiled
gingham
apron
a
sturdy
little
chap
whose
face
was
still
eloquent
of
his
recent
breakfast
came
running
to
meet
me
i
stopped
the
mare
a
moment
later
a
woman
was
at
the
gate
between
the
rows
of
hollyhocks
when
she
saw
me
she
began
hastily
to
roll
down
her
sleeves
why
mr
grayson
how
the
boy
anna
and
it
was
the
cheerful
talk
we
had
there
by
the
roadside
and
the
sight
of
the
sturdy
boy
playing
in
the
sunshine
and
the
hollyhocks
and
the
dilapidated
house
that
brought
to
memory
the
old
story
of
anna
which
i
here
set
down
not
because
it
carries
any
moral
but
because
it
is
a
common
little
piece
out
of
real
life
in
which
harriet
and
i
have
been
interested
vi
the
drunkard
it
is
a
strange
thing
adventure
i
looked
for
her
high
and
i
looked
for
her
low
and
she
passed
my
door
in
a
tattered
garment
unheeded
for
i
had
neither
the
eye
of
simplicity
nor
the
heart
of
humility
one
day
i
looked
for
her
anew
and
i
saw
her
beckoning
from
the
open
road
and
underneath
the
tags
and
tatters
i
caught
the
gleam
of
her
celestial
garment
and
i
went
with
her
into
a
new
world
i
have
had
a
singular
adventure
in
which
i
have
made
a
friend
and
i
have
seen
new
things
which
are
also
true
my
friend
is
a
drunkard
at
least
so
i
call
him
following
the
custom
of
the
country
on
his
way
from
town
he
used
often
to
come
by
my
farm
i
could
hear
him
singing
afar
off
beginning
at
the
bridge
where
on
still
days
one
can
hear
the
rattle
of
a
wagon
on
the
loose
boards
he
sang
in
a
peculiar
clear
high
voice
i
make
no
further
comment
upon
the
singing
nor
the
cause
of
it
but
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
the
air
was
still
and
he
usually
came
in
the
evening
i
often
heard
the
cadences
of
his
song
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
then
i
saw
him
come
driving
by
my
farm
sitting
on
the
spring
seat
of
his
wagon
and
if
he
chanced
to
see
me
in
my
field
he
would
take
off
his
hat
and
make
me
a
grandiloquent
bow
but
never
for
a
moment
stop
his
singing
and
so
he
passed
by
the
house
and
i
with
a
smile
saw
him
moving
up
the
hill
in
the
north
road
until
finally
his
voice
still
singing
died
away
in
the
distance
once
i
happened
to
reach
the
house
just
as
the
singer
was
passing
and
harriet
said
there
goes
that
drunkard
it
gave
me
an
indescribable
shock
of
course
i
had
known
as
much
and
yet
i
had
not
directly
applied
the
term
i
had
not
thought
of
my
singer
as
for
i
had
often
been
conscious
in
spite
of
myself
alone
in
my
fields
of
something
human
and
cheerful
which
had
touched
me
in
passing
after
harriet
applied
her
name
to
my
singer
i
was
of
two
minds
concerning
him
i
struggled
with
myself
i
tried
instinctively
to
discipline
my
pulses
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
his
singing
for
was
he
not
a
drunkard
lord
how
we
get
our
moralities
mixed
up
with
our
realities
and
then
one
evening
when
i
saw
him
coming
i
had
been
a
long
day
alone
in
my
fields
i
experienced
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
with
an
indescribable
joyousness
of
adventure
i
stepped
out
toward
the
fence
and
pretended
to
be
hard
at
work
after
all
i
said
to
myself
this
is
a
large
world
with
room
in
it
for
many
curious
people
i
waited
in
excitement
when
he
came
near
me
i
straightened
up
just
as
though
i
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
when
he
lifted
his
hat
to
me
i
lifted
my
hat
as
grandiloquently
as
he
how
are
you
neighbour
i
asked
he
paused
for
a
single
instant
and
gave
me
a
smile
then
he
replaced
his
hat
as
though
he
had
far
more
important
business
to
attend
to
and
went
on
up
the
road
my
next
glimpse
of
him
was
a
complete
surprise
to
me
i
saw
him
on
the
street
in
town
harriet
pointed
him
out
else
i
should
never
have
recognized
him
a
quiet
shy
modest
man
as
different
as
one
could
imagine
from
the
singer
i
had
seen
so
often
passing
my
farm
he
wore
neat
worn
clothes
and
his
horse
stood
tied
in
front
of
the
store
he
had
brought
his
honey
to
town
to
sell
he
was
a
i
stopped
and
asked
him
about
his
honey
and
whether
the
fall
flowers
had
been
plenty
i
ran
my
eye
over
his
horse
and
said
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
good
animal
but
i
could
get
very
little
from
him
and
that
little
in
a
rather
low
voice
i
came
away
with
my
interest
whetted
to
a
still
keener
edge
how
a
man
has
come
to
be
what
he
is
is
there
any
discovery
better
worth
making
illustration
he
usually
came
in
the
evening
after
that
day
in
town
i
watched
for
the
and
i
saw
him
often
on
his
way
to
town
silent
somewhat
bent
forward
in
his
seat
driving
his
horse
with
circumspection
a
jekyll
of
propriety
and
a
few
hours
later
he
would
come
homeward
a
wholly
different
person
straight
of
back
joyous
of
mien
singing
his
songs
in
his
high
clear
voice
a
very
hyde
of
recklessness
even
the
old
horse
seemed
changed
he
held
his
head
higher
and
stepped
with
a
quicker
pace
when
the
went
toward
town
he
never
paused
nor
once
looked
around
to
see
me
in
my
field
but
when
he
came
back
he
watched
for
me
and
when
i
responded
to
his
bow
he
would
sometimes
stop
and
reply
to
my
greeting
one
day
he
came
from
town
on
foot
and
when
he
saw
me
even
though
i
was
some
distance
away
he
approached
the
fence
and
took
off
his
hat
and
held
out
his
hand
i
walked
over
toward
him
i
saw
his
full
face
for
the
first
time
a
rather
handsome
face
the
hair
was
thin
and
curly
the
forehead
generous
and
smooth
but
the
chin
was
small
his
face
was
slightly
flushed
and
his
eyes
his
eyes
i
shook
his
hand
i
had
hoped
i
said
that
you
would
stop
sometime
as
you
went
by
well
i
wanted
to
stop
but
i
a
busy
man
i
have
important
matters
in
hand
almost
all
the
time
you
usually
drive
yes
ordinarily
i
drive
i
do
not
use
a
team
but
i
have
in
view
a
fine
span
of
roadsters
one
of
these
days
you
will
see
me
going
by
your
farm
in
style
my
wife
and
i
both
enjoy
driving
i
wish
i
could
here
convey
the
tone
of
buoyancy
with
which
he
said
these
words
there
was
a
largeness
and
confidence
in
them
that
carried
me
away
he
told
me
that
he
was
now
working
with
the
experts
those
were
his
words
and
that
he
would
soon
begin
building
a
house
that
would
astonish
the
country
upon
this
he
turned
abruptly
away
but
came
back
and
with
fine
courtesy
shook
my
hand
you
see
he
said
i
am
a
busy
man
grayson
and
a
happy
man
so
he
set
off
down
the
road
and
as
he
passed
my
house
he
began
singing
again
in
his
high
voice
i
walked
away
with
a
feeling
of
wonder
not
unmixed
with
sorrow
it
was
a
strange
case
gradually
i
became
really
acquainted
with
the
at
first
with
the
exuberant
confident
imaginative
far
more
slowly
with
the
shy
reserved
it
was
quite
an
adventure
my
first
talk
with
the
shy
i
was
driving
home
i
met
him
near
the
lower
bridge
i
cudgeled
my
brain
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
at
him
as
he
passed
i
leaned
out
and
said
friend
will
you
do
me
a
favour
i
neglected
to
stop
at
the
would
you
call
and
see
whether
anything
has
been
left
for
me
in
the
box
since
the
carrier
started
certainly
he
said
glancing
up
at
me
but
turning
his
head
swiftly
aside
again
on
his
way
back
he
stopped
and
left
me
a
paper
he
told
me
volubly
about
the
way
he
would
run
the
if
he
were
in
a
place
of
suitable
authority
great
things
are
possible
he
said
to
the
man
of
ideas
at
this
point
began
one
of
the
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
the
exuberant
referred
disparagingly
to
the
shy
i
must
have
looked
pretty
seedy
and
stupid
this
morning
on
my
way
in
i
was
up
half
the
night
but
i
feel
all
right
now
the
next
time
i
met
the
shy
he
on
his
part
apologised
for
the
exuberant
hesitatingly
falteringly
winding
up
with
the
words
i
think
you
will
understand
i
grasped
his
hand
and
left
him
with
a
wan
smile
on
his
face
instinctively
i
came
to
treat
the
two
men
in
a
wholly
different
manner
with
the
one
i
was
blustering
listening
with
eagerness
to
his
expansive
talk
but
to
the
other
i
said
little
feeling
my
way
slowly
to
his
friendship
for
i
could
not
help
looking
upon
him
as
a
pathetic
figure
he
needed
a
friend
the
exuberant
was
sufficient
unto
himself
glorious
in
his
visions
and
i
had
from
him
no
little
entertainment
i
told
harriet
about
my
adventures
they
did
not
meet
with
her
approval
she
said
i
was
encouraging
a
vice
harriet
i
said
go
over
and
see
his
wife
i
wonder
what
she
thinks
about
it
thinks
exclaimed
harriet
what
should
the
wife
of
a
drunkard
think
but
she
went
over
as
soon
as
she
returned
i
saw
that
something
was
wrong
but
i
asked
no
questions
during
supper
she
was
extraordinarily
preoccupied
and
it
was
not
until
an
hour
or
more
afterward
that
she
came
into
my
room
david
she
said
i
ca
understand
some
things
is
human
nature
doing
what
it
ought
to
i
asked
but
she
was
not
to
be
joked
with
david
that
man
wife
does
seem
to
be
sorry
because
he
comes
home
drunken
every
week
or
two
i
talked
with
her
about
it
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
she
said
she
knew
it
was
wrong
but
she
intimated
that
when
he
was
in
that
state
she
loved
liked
him
all
the
better
is
it
believable
she
said
you
wo
understand
it
wrong
i
know
but
when
he
comes
home
that
way
he
seems
so
full
of
life
he
he
seems
to
understand
me
better
then
she
was
heartbroken
one
could
see
that
but
she
would
not
admit
it
i
leave
it
to
you
david
what
can
anyone
do
with
a
woman
like
that
how
is
the
man
ever
to
overcome
his
habits
it
is
a
strange
thing
when
we
ask
questions
directly
of
life
how
often
the
answers
are
unexpected
and
confusing
our
logic
becomes
illogical
our
stories
wo
turn
out
she
told
much
more
about
her
interview
the
neat
home
the
bees
in
the
orchard
the
garden
when
he
sober
she
said
he
seems
to
be
a
steady
hard
worker
after
that
i
desired
more
than
ever
to
see
deep
into
the
life
of
the
strange
why
was
he
what
he
was
and
at
last
the
time
came
as
things
come
to
him
who
desires
them
faithfully
enough
one
afternoon
not
long
ago
a
fine
autumn
afternoon
when
the
trees
were
glorious
on
the
hills
the
indian
summer
sun
never
softer
i
was
tramping
along
a
wood
lane
far
back
of
my
farm
and
at
the
roadside
near
the
trunk
of
an
oak
tree
sat
my
friend
the
he
was
a
picture
of
despondency
one
long
hand
hanging
limp
between
his
knees
his
head
bowed
down
when
he
saw
me
he
straightened
up
looked
at
me
and
settled
back
again
my
heart
went
out
to
him
and
i
sat
down
beside
him
have
you
ever
seen
a
finer
afternoon
i
asked
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
fine
he
answered
vaguely
as
if
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
i
saw
instantly
what
the
matter
was
the
exuberant
was
in
process
of
transformation
into
the
shy
i
do
know
exactly
how
it
came
about
for
such
things
are
difficult
to
explain
but
i
led
him
to
talk
of
himself
after
it
is
all
over
he
said
of
course
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
you
do
know
grayson
what
it
all
means
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
now
and
yet
i
know
i
shall
do
it
again
no
i
said
you
will
not
do
it
again
yes
i
shall
something
inside
of
me
argues
why
should
you
be
sorry
were
you
not
free
for
a
whole
afternoon
free
i
asked
yes
free
you
will
not
understand
but
every
day
i
work
work
work
i
have
friends
but
somehow
i
ca
get
to
them
i
ca
even
get
to
my
wife
it
seems
as
if
a
wall
hemmed
me
in
as
if
i
were
bound
to
a
rock
which
i
could
get
away
from
i
am
also
afraid
when
i
am
sober
i
know
how
to
do
great
things
but
i
ca
do
them
after
a
few
glasses
i
never
take
more
i
not
only
know
i
can
do
great
things
but
i
feel
as
though
i
were
really
doing
them
but
you
never
do
no
i
never
do
but
i
that
i
can
all
the
bonds
break
and
the
wall
falls
down
and
i
am
free
i
can
really
touch
people
i
feel
friendly
and
neighbourly
he
was
talking
eagerly
now
trying
to
explain
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
said
how
it
was
that
he
did
what
he
did
he
told
me
how
beautiful
it
made
the
world
where
before
it
was
miserable
and
friendless
how
he
thought
of
great
things
and
made
great
plans
how
his
home
seemed
finer
and
better
to
him
and
his
work
more
noble
the
man
had
a
real
gift
of
imagination
and
spoke
with
an
eagerness
and
eloquence
that
stirred
me
deeply
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
asking
him
where
his
magic
liquor
was
to
be
found
when
he
finally
gave
me
an
opening
i
said
i
think
i
understand
many
men
i
know
are
in
some
respects
drunkards
they
all
want
some
way
to
escape
themselves
to
be
free
of
their
own
limitations
that
it
that
it
he
exclaimed
eagerly
we
sat
for
a
time
side
by
side
saying
nothing
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
that
line
of
virgil
referring
to
quite
another
sort
of
intoxication
with
voluntary
dreams
they
cheat
their
minds
instead
of
that
beautiful
unity
of
thought
and
action
which
marks
the
finest
character
here
was
this
poor
tragedy
of
the
divided
life
when
fate
would
destroy
a
man
it
first
separates
his
forces
it
drives
him
to
think
one
way
and
act
another
it
encourages
him
to
seek
through
outward
stimulation
whether
drink
or
riches
or
fame
a
deceptive
and
unworthy
satisfaction
in
place
of
that
true
contentment
which
comes
only
from
unity
within
no
man
can
be
two
men
successfully
so
we
sat
and
said
nothing
what
indeed
can
any
man
to
another
under
such
circumstances
as
bobbie
burns
remarks
out
of
the
depths
of
his
own
experience
what
done
we
partly
may
compute
but
know
not
what
resisted
i
always
felt
that
the
best
thing
one
man
can
give
another
is
the
warm
hand
of
understanding
and
yet
when
i
thought
of
the
pathetic
shy
hemmed
in
by
his
sunless
walls
i
felt
that
i
should
also
say
something
seeing
two
men
struggling
shall
i
not
assist
the
better
shall
i
let
the
sober
one
be
despoiled
by
him
who
is
riotous
there
are
realities
but
there
are
also
moralities
if
we
can
keep
them
properly
separated
most
of
us
i
said
finally
are
in
some
respects
drunkards
we
give
it
so
harsh
a
name
but
we
are
just
that
drunkenness
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
intoxicating
liquors
it
goes
deeper
far
deeper
drunkenness
is
the
failure
of
a
man
to
control
his
thoughts
the
sat
silent
gazing
out
before
him
i
noted
the
blue
veins
in
the
hand
that
lay
on
his
knee
it
came
over
me
with
sudden
amusement
and
i
said
i
often
get
drunk
myself
you
yes
dreadfully
drunk
he
looked
at
me
and
laughed
for
the
first
time
and
i
laughed
too
do
you
know
there
a
lot
of
human
nature
in
people
and
when
you
think
you
are
deep
in
tragedy
behold
humour
lurks
just
around
the
corner
i
used
to
laugh
at
it
a
good
deal
more
than
i
do
now
he
said
been
through
it
all
sometimes
when
i
go
to
town
i
say
to
myself
will
not
turn
at
that
corner
but
when
i
come
to
the
corner
i
do
turn
then
i
say
will
not
go
into
that
bar
but
i
do
go
in
will
not
order
anything
to
drink
i
say
to
myself
and
then
i
hear
myself
talking
aloud
to
the
barkeeper
just
as
though
i
were
some
other
person
me
a
glass
of
rye
i
say
and
i
stand
off
looking
at
myself
very
angry
and
sorrowful
but
gradually
i
seem
to
grow
weaker
and
weaker
or
rather
stronger
and
stronger
for
my
brain
begins
to
become
clear
and
i
see
things
and
feel
things
i
never
saw
or
felt
before
i
want
to
sing
and
you
do
sing
i
said
i
do
indeed
he
responded
laughing
and
it
seems
to
me
the
most
beautiful
music
in
the
world
sometimes
i
said
when
i
on
kind
of
spree
i
try
not
so
much
to
empty
my
mind
of
the
thoughts
which
bother
me
but
rather
to
fill
my
mind
with
other
stronger
thoughts
before
i
could
finish
he
had
interrupted
have
i
tried
that
too
do
i
think
of
other
things
i
think
of
bees
and
that
leads
me
to
honey
does
it
and
that
makes
me
think
of
putting
the
honey
in
the
wagon
and
taking
it
to
town
then
of
course
i
think
how
it
will
sell
instantly
stronger
than
you
can
imagine
i
see
a
dime
in
my
hand
then
it
appears
on
the
wet
bar
i
the
of
the
liquor
and
there
you
are
we
did
not
talk
much
more
that
day
we
got
up
and
shook
hands
and
looked
each
other
in
the
eye
the
turned
away
but
came
back
hesitatingly
i
am
glad
of
this
talk
grayson
it
makes
me
feel
like
taking
hold
again
i
have
been
in
hell
for
years
of
course
i
said
you
needed
a
friend
you
and
i
will
come
up
together
as
i
walked
toward
home
that
evening
i
felt
a
curious
warmth
of
satisfaction
in
my
soul
and
i
marvelled
at
the
many
strange
things
that
are
to
be
found
upon
this
miraculous
earth
i
suppose
if
i
were
writing
a
story
i
should
stop
at
this
point
but
i
am
dealing
in
life
and
life
does
not
always
respond
to
our
impatience
with
satisfactory
moral
conclusions
life
is
inconclusive
quite
open
at
the
end
i
had
a
vision
of
a
new
life
for
my
neighbour
the
and
have
it
yet
for
i
have
not
done
with
him
but
last
evening
and
that
is
why
i
have
been
prompted
to
write
the
whole
story
my
came
again
along
the
road
by
my
farm
my
exuberant
i
heard
him
singing
afar
off
he
did
not
see
me
as
he
went
by
but
as
i
stood
looking
out
at
him
it
came
over
me
with
a
sudden
sense
of
largeness
and
quietude
that
the
sun
shone
on
him
as
genially
as
it
did
on
me
and
that
the
leaves
did
not
turn
aside
from
him
nor
the
birds
stop
singing
when
he
passed
he
also
belongs
here
i
said
and
i
watched
him
as
he
mounted
the
distant
hill
until
i
could
no
longer
hear
the
high
clear
cadences
of
his
song
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
human
in
passing
had
touched
me
vii
an
old
maid
one
of
my
neighbours
whom
i
never
have
chanced
to
mention
before
in
these
writings
is
a
certain
old
maid
she
lives
about
two
miles
from
my
farm
in
a
small
white
house
set
in
the
midst
of
a
modest
neat
garden
with
apple
trees
in
the
orchard
behind
it
she
lives
all
alone
save
for
a
stupid
nephew
who
does
most
of
the
work
on
the
farm
and
does
it
a
little
unwillingly
harriet
and
i
had
not
been
here
above
a
week
when
we
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
aiken
or
rather
she
made
our
acquaintance
for
she
fills
the
place
most
important
in
a
country
community
of
a
sensitive
social
tentacle
reaching
out
to
touch
with
sympathy
the
stranger
harriet
was
amused
at
first
by
what
she
considered
an
almost
unwarrantable
curiosity
but
we
soon
formed
a
genuine
liking
for
the
little
old
lady
and
since
then
we
have
often
seen
her
in
her
home
and
often
she
has
come
to
ours
she
was
here
only
last
night
i
considered
her
as
she
sat
rocking
in
front
of
our
fire
a
picture
of
wholesome
comfort
i
have
had
much
to
say
of
contentment
she
seems
really
to
live
it
although
i
have
found
that
contentment
is
easier
to
discover
in
the
lives
of
our
neighbours
than
in
our
own
all
her
life
long
she
has
lived
here
in
this
community
a
world
of
small
things
one
is
tempted
to
say
with
a
sort
of
expected
and
predictable
life
i
thought
last
night
as
i
observed
her
gently
stirring
her
how
her
life
must
be
made
up
of
small
events
pancakes
puddings
patchings
who
knows
what
other
orderly
habitual
minute
affairs
who
knows
who
knows
when
he
looks
at
you
or
at
me
that
there
is
anything
in
us
beyond
the
humdrummery
of
this
day
in
front
of
her
house
are
two
long
boarded
beds
of
flowers
mignonette
and
petunias
chiefly
and
over
the
small
very
white
door
with
its
shiny
knob
creeps
a
white
clematis
vine
just
inside
the
you
will
discover
a
bright
clean
oval
rag
rug
which
prepares
you
as
small
things
lead
to
greater
for
the
larger
brighter
cleaner
rug
of
the
there
on
the
you
will
discover
snow
bound
by
john
greenleaf
whittier
tupper
poems
a
large
embossed
bible
the
family
plush
album
and
a
book
with
a
gilt
ladder
on
the
cover
which
leads
upward
to
gilt
stars
called
the
path
of
life
on
the
wall
are
two
companion
pictures
of
a
rosy
fat
child
in
faded
gilt
frames
one
called
wide
awake
the
other
fast
asleep
not
far
away
in
a
corner
on
the
top
of
the
walnut
whatnot
is
a
curious
vase
filled
with
pampas
plumes
there
are
and
a
piece
of
coral
on
the
shelf
below
and
right
in
the
midst
of
the
room
are
three
very
large
black
with
cushions
in
every
conceivable
and
available
place
including
cushions
on
the
arms
two
of
them
are
for
you
and
me
if
we
should
come
in
to
call
the
other
is
for
the
cat
when
you
sit
down
you
can
look
out
between
the
starchiest
of
starchy
curtains
into
the
yard
where
there
is
an
innumerable
busy
flock
of
chickens
she
keeps
chickens
and
all
the
important
ones
are
named
she
has
one
called
martin
luther
another
is
josiah
gilbert
holland
once
she
came
over
to
our
house
with
a
basket
from
one
end
of
which
were
thrust
the
sturdy
red
legs
of
a
pullet
she
informed
us
that
she
had
brought
us
one
of
evangeline
daughters
but
i
am
getting
out
of
the
house
before
i
am
fairly
well
into
it
the
expresses
miss
aiken
but
not
so
well
somehow
as
the
immaculate
bedroom
beyond
into
which
upon
one
occasion
i
was
permitted
to
steal
a
modest
glimpse
it
was
of
an
incomparable
neatness
and
order
all
hung
about
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
with
white
starchy
things
and
ornamented
with
bright
but
inexpensive
nothings
in
this
wonderful
bedroom
there
is
a
secret
and
sacred
drawer
into
which
once
in
her
life
harriet
had
a
glimpse
it
contains
the
clothes
all
gently
folded
exhaling
an
odour
of
lavender
in
which
our
friend
will
appear
when
she
has
closed
her
eyes
to
open
them
no
more
upon
this
earth
in
such
calm
readiness
she
awaits
her
time
upon
the
bureau
in
this
sacred
apartment
stands
a
small
rosewood
box
which
is
locked
into
which
no
one
in
our
neighbourhood
has
had
so
much
as
a
single
peep
i
should
not
dare
of
course
to
speculate
upon
its
contents
perhaps
an
old
letter
or
two
a
ring
and
a
rose
a
ribbon
that
is
more
than
a
ribbon
a
picture
that
is
more
than
art
who
can
tell
as
i
passed
that
way
i
fancied
i
could
distinguish
a
faint
mysterious
odour
which
i
associated
with
the
rosewood
box
an
odour
composed
of
many
simples
on
the
stand
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
close
to
the
candlestick
is
a
bible
a
little
familiar
daily
bible
very
different
indeed
from
the
portentous
and
imposing
family
bible
which
reposes
on
the
in
the
front
room
which
is
never
opened
except
to
record
a
death
it
has
been
well
worn
this
small
nightly
bible
by
much
handling
is
there
a
care
or
a
trouble
in
this
world
here
is
the
sure
talisman
she
seeks
and
finds
the
inspired
text
wherever
she
opens
the
book
she
seizes
the
first
words
her
eyes
fall
upon
as
a
prophetic
message
to
her
then
she
goes
forth
like
some
david
with
his
sling
so
panoplied
with
courage
that
she
is
daunted
by
no
goliath
of
the
philistines
also
she
has
a
worshipfulness
of
all
ministers
sometimes
when
the
scotch
preacher
comes
to
tea
and
remarks
that
her
pudding
is
good
i
firmly
believe
that
she
interprets
the
words
into
a
spiritual
message
for
her
besides
the
drawer
the
rosewood
box
and
the
worn
bible
there
is
a
certain
black
cape
far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
a
description
but
i
can
say
with
some
assurance
that
it
also
occupies
a
shrine
it
may
not
be
in
the
inner
sanctuary
but
it
certainly
occupies
a
goodly
part
of
the
outer
porch
of
the
temple
all
this
of
course
is
figurative
for
the
cape
hangs
just
inside
the
closet
door
on
a
hanger
with
a
white
cloth
over
the
shoulders
to
keep
off
the
dust
for
the
vanities
of
the
world
enter
even
such
a
sanctuary
as
this
i
wish
indeed
that
you
could
see
miss
aiken
wearing
her
cape
on
a
sunday
in
the
late
fall
when
she
comes
to
church
her
sweet
old
face
shining
under
her
black
hat
her
silk
skirt
giving
out
an
audible
not
unimpressive
sound
as
she
moves
down
the
aisle
with
what
dignity
she
steps
into
her
pew
with
what
care
she
sits
down
so
that
she
may
not
crush
the
cookies
in
her
ample
pocket
with
what
meek
pride
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
meek
pride
she
looks
up
at
the
scotch
preacher
as
he
stands
sturdily
in
his
pulpit
announcing
the
first
hymn
and
many
an
eye
turning
that
way
to
look
turns
with
affection
several
times
harriet
and
i
have
been
with
her
to
tea
like
many
another
genius
she
has
no
conception
of
her
own
art
in
such
matters
as
apple
puddings
she
herself
prefers
graham
gems
in
which
she
believes
there
inheres
a
certain
mysterious
efficacy
she
bakes
gems
on
monday
and
has
them
steamed
during
the
remainder
of
the
week
with
tea
and
as
a
sort
of
dessert
she
tells
us
about
the
danas
the
aikens
and
the
carnahans
who
are
in
various
relationships
her
progenitors
we
gravitate
into
the
other
room
and
presently
she
shows
us
in
the
plush
album
the
portraits
of
various
cousins
aunts
and
uncles
and
harriet
warms
up
and
begins
to
tell
about
the
scribners
the
macintoshes
and
the
strayers
who
are
progenitors
the
aikens
says
miss
aiken
were
always
like
that
downright
and
outspoken
it
is
an
aiken
trait
no
aiken
could
ever
help
blurting
out
the
truth
if
he
knew
he
were
to
die
for
it
the
next
minute
that
was
like
the
macintoshes
harriet
puts
in
old
grandfather
macintosh
by
this
time
i
am
settled
comfortably
in
the
cushioned
to
watch
the
fray
miss
aiken
advances
a
dana
harriet
counters
with
a
strayer
miss
aiken
deploys
the
carnahans
in
open
order
upon
which
harriet
entrenches
herself
with
the
heroic
scribners
and
lets
fly
a
macintosh
who
was
a
general
in
the
colonial
army
surprised
but
not
defeated
miss
aiken
withdraws
in
good
order
covering
her
retreat
with
two
ancestors
the
existence
of
whom
she
establishes
with
a
blue
cup
and
an
ancient
silver
spoon
no
one
knows
the
joy
of
fighting
relatives
until
he
has
watched
such
a
battle
following
the
complete
comfort
of
a
good
supper
if
any
one
is
sick
in
the
community
miss
aiken
hears
instantly
of
it
by
a
sort
of
wireless
telegraphy
or
telepathy
which
would
astonish
a
east
indian
she
appears
with
her
little
basket
which
has
two
brown
flaps
for
covers
opening
from
the
middle
and
with
a
spring
in
them
somewhere
so
that
they
fly
shut
with
a
snap
out
of
this
she
takes
a
bowl
of
chicken
broth
a
jar
of
ambrosial
jelly
a
cake
of
delectable
honey
and
a
bottle
of
celestial
raspberry
shrub
if
the
patient
will
only
eat
he
will
immediately
rise
up
and
walk
or
if
he
dies
it
is
a
pleasant
sort
of
death
i
have
myself
thought
on
several
occasions
of
being
taken
with
a
brief
fit
of
sickness
in
telling
all
these
things
about
miss
aiken
which
seem
to
describe
her
i
have
told
only
the
commonplace
the
expected
or
predictable
details
often
and
often
i
pause
when
i
see
an
interesting
man
or
woman
and
ask
myself
how
after
all
does
this
person
live
for
we
all
know
it
is
not
chiefly
by
the
clothes
we
wear
or
the
house
we
occupy
or
the
friends
we
touch
there
is
something
deeper
more
secret
which
furnishes
the
real
motive
and
character
of
our
lives
what
a
triumph
then
is
every
fine
old
man
to
have
come
out
of
a
long
life
with
a
spirit
still
sunny
is
not
that
an
heroic
accomplishment
of
the
real
life
of
our
friend
i
know
only
one
thing
but
that
thing
is
precious
to
me
for
it
gives
me
a
glimpse
of
the
far
dim
alps
that
rise
out
of
the
plains
of
contentment
it
is
nothing
very
definite
such
things
never
are
and
yet
i
like
to
think
of
it
when
i
see
her
treading
the
useful
round
of
her
simple
life
as
i
said
she
has
lived
here
in
this
neighbourhood
oh
sixty
years
the
country
knew
her
father
before
her
out
of
that
past
through
the
dimming
eyes
of
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
i
have
had
glimpses
of
the
sprightly
girlhood
which
our
friend
must
have
enjoyed
there
is
even
a
confused
story
of
a
wooer
how
people
try
to
account
for
every
old
maid
a
long
time
ago
who
came
and
went
away
again
no
one
remembers
much
about
him
such
things
are
not
important
of
course
after
so
many
years
but
i
must
get
to
thing
i
treasure
one
day
harriet
called
at
the
little
house
it
was
in
summer
and
the
door
stood
open
she
presumed
on
the
privilege
of
friendship
and
walked
straight
in
there
she
saw
sitting
at
the
table
her
head
on
her
arm
in
a
curious
girlish
abandon
unlike
the
prim
miss
aiken
we
knew
so
well
our
old
maid
when
she
heard
harriet
step
she
started
up
with
breath
quickly
indrawn
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
something
in
her
hand
she
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
then
impulsively
unlike
her
too
she
threw
an
arm
around
harriet
and
buried
her
face
on
harriet
shoulder
in
response
to
harriet
question
she
said
oh
an
old
old
trouble
no
trouble
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
all
the
new
troubles
were
the
troubles
of
other
people
you
may
say
this
is
much
of
a
clue
well
it
is
and
yet
i
like
to
have
it
in
mind
it
gives
me
somehow
the
woman
who
is
not
expected
or
predictable
or
commonplace
i
seem
to
understand
our
old
maid
the
better
and
when
i
think
of
her
bustling
inquisitive
helpful
gentle
ways
and
the
shine
of
her
white
soul
i
sure
i
know
what
we
should
do
without
her
in
this
community
viii
a
roadside
prophet
from
my
upper
field
when
i
look
across
the
countryside
i
can
see
in
the
distance
a
short
stretch
of
the
gray
town
road
it
winds
out
of
a
little
wood
crosses
a
knoll
and
loses
itself
again
beyond
the
trees
of
an
old
orchard
i
love
that
spot
in
my
upper
field
and
the
view
of
the
road
beyond
when
i
am
at
work
there
i
have
only
to
look
up
to
see
the
world
go
by
part
of
it
going
down
to
the
town
and
part
of
it
coming
up
again
and
i
never
see
a
traveller
on
the
hill
especially
if
he
be
afoot
without
feeling
that
if
i
met
him
i
should
like
him
and
that
whatever
he
had
to
say
i
should
like
to
hear
at
first
i
could
not
make
out
what
the
man
was
doing
most
of
the
travellers
i
see
from
my
field
are
like
the
people
i
commonly
meet
so
intent
upon
their
destination
that
they
take
no
joy
of
the
road
they
travel
they
do
not
even
see
me
here
in
the
fields
and
if
they
did
they
would
probably
think
me
a
slow
and
unprofitable
person
i
have
nothing
that
they
can
carry
away
and
store
up
in
barns
or
reduce
to
percentages
or
calculate
as
profit
and
loss
they
do
not
perceive
what
a
wonderful
place
this
is
they
do
not
know
that
here
too
we
gather
a
crop
of
contentment
but
apparently
this
man
was
the
pattern
of
a
loiterer
i
saw
him
stop
on
the
knoll
and
look
widely
about
him
then
he
stooped
down
as
though
searching
for
something
then
moved
slowly
forward
for
a
few
steps
just
at
that
point
in
the
road
lies
a
great
smooth
boulder
which
long
since
dead
had
rolled
out
upon
the
wayside
here
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
him
kneel
upon
the
ground
he
had
something
in
one
hand
with
which
he
seemed
intently
occupied
after
a
time
he
stood
up
and
retreating
a
few
steps
down
the
road
he
scanned
the
boulder
narrowly
this
i
said
to
myself
may
be
something
for
me
so
i
crossed
the
fence
and
walked
down
the
neighbouring
field
it
was
an
indian
summer
day
with
hazy
hillsides
and
still
sunshine
and
slumbering
brown
fields
the
sort
of
a
day
i
love
i
leaped
the
little
brook
in
the
valley
and
strode
hastily
up
the
opposite
slope
i
can
not
describe
what
a
sense
i
had
of
new
worlds
to
be
found
here
in
old
fields
so
i
came
to
the
fence
on
the
other
side
and
looked
over
my
man
was
kneeling
again
at
the
rock
i
was
scarcely
twenty
paces
from
him
but
so
earnestly
was
he
engaged
that
he
never
once
saw
me
i
had
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
a
small
thin
man
with
straight
gray
hair
above
his
collar
i
could
see
the
wrinkles
of
his
neck
his
coat
was
of
black
of
a
noticeably
neat
appearance
and
i
observed
as
a
further
evidence
of
fastidiousness
rare
upon
the
road
that
he
was
saving
his
trousers
by
kneeling
on
a
bit
of
carpet
what
he
could
be
doing
there
so
intently
by
the
roadside
i
could
not
imagine
so
i
climbed
the
fence
making
some
little
intentional
noise
as
i
did
so
he
arose
immediately
then
i
saw
at
his
side
on
the
ground
two
small
tin
cans
and
in
his
hands
a
pair
of
paint
brushes
as
he
stepped
aside
i
saw
the
words
he
had
been
painting
on
the
boulder
god
is
love
a
meek
figure
indeed
he
looked
and
when
he
saw
me
advancing
he
said
with
a
deference
that
was
almost
timidity
good
morning
sir
good
morning
brother
i
returned
heartily
his
face
brightened
perceptibly
do
stop
on
my
account
i
said
finish
off
your
work
he
knelt
again
on
his
bit
of
carpet
and
proceeded
busily
with
his
brushes
i
stood
and
watched
him
the
lettering
was
somewhat
crude
but
he
had
the
swift
deftness
of
long
practice
how
long
i
inquired
have
you
been
at
this
sort
of
work
ten
years
he
replied
looking
up
at
me
with
a
pale
smile
off
and
on
for
ten
years
winters
i
work
at
my
trade
i
am
a
journeyman
painter
but
when
spring
comes
and
again
in
the
fall
i
follow
the
road
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
dropping
his
voice
in
words
of
the
utmost
seriousness
i
live
by
the
word
by
the
word
i
asked
yes
by
the
word
and
putting
down
his
brushes
he
took
from
an
inner
pocket
a
small
package
of
papers
one
of
which
he
handed
to
me
it
bore
at
the
top
this
sentence
in
large
type
is
not
my
word
like
fire
saith
the
lord
and
like
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces
i
stood
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
i
suppose
no
one
man
is
stranger
than
any
other
but
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
never
met
a
more
curious
person
and
i
was
consumed
with
a
desire
to
know
why
he
was
what
he
was
do
you
always
paint
the
same
sign
i
asked
oh
no
he
answered
i
have
a
feeling
about
what
i
should
paint
when
i
came
up
the
road
here
this
morning
i
stopped
a
minute
and
it
all
seemed
so
calm
and
nice
he
swept
his
arm
in
the
direction
of
the
fields
that
i
says
to
myself
will
paint
god
is
love
an
appropriate
text
i
said
for
this
very
spot
he
seemed
much
gratified
oh
you
can
follow
your
feelings
he
exclaimed
sometimes
near
towns
i
ca
paint
anything
but
yawns
and
to
meet
thy
god
i
do
like
as
well
as
is
love
but
it
seems
like
i
had
to
paint
now
when
i
was
in
arizona
he
paused
a
moment
wiping
his
brushes
when
i
was
in
arizona
he
was
saying
mostly
i
painted
ye
it
seemed
like
i
could
paint
anything
else
and
in
some
places
i
felt
moved
to
put
ye
twice
on
the
same
rock
i
began
to
ask
him
questions
about
arizona
but
i
soon
found
how
little
he
too
had
taken
toll
of
the
road
he
travelled
for
he
seemed
to
have
brought
back
memories
only
of
the
texts
he
painted
and
the
fact
that
in
some
places
good
stones
were
scarce
and
that
he
had
to
carry
extra
turpentine
to
thin
his
paint
the
weather
being
dry
i
do
know
that
he
is
a
lone
representative
of
this
trait
i
have
known
farmers
who
in
travelling
saw
only
plows
and
and
and
preachers
who
looking
across
such
autumn
fields
as
these
would
carry
away
only
a
musty
text
or
two
i
pity
some
of
those
who
expect
to
go
to
heaven
they
will
find
so
little
to
surprise
them
in
the
golden
streets
but
i
persevered
with
my
painter
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
talking
with
the
greatest
friendliness
having
now
finished
his
work
he
shook
out
his
bit
of
carpet
screwed
the
tops
on
his
paint
cans
wrapped
up
his
brushes
and
disposed
of
them
all
with
the
deftness
of
long
experience
in
his
small
black
bag
then
he
stood
up
and
looked
critically
at
his
work
it
all
right
i
said
a
great
many
people
coming
this
way
in
the
next
hundred
years
will
see
it
that
what
i
want
he
said
eagerly
that
what
i
want
most
people
never
hear
the
word
at
all
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
it
a
curious
thing
mister
perhaps
you
noticed
it
yourself
that
the
best
things
of
all
in
the
world
people
wo
have
as
a
gift
i
noticed
it
i
said
it
strange
is
it
he
again
remarked
very
strange
i
said
i
do
know
i
can
blame
them
he
continued
i
was
that
way
myself
for
a
good
many
years
all
around
me
gold
and
diamonds
and
precious
jewels
and
me
never
once
seeing
them
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
stoop
and
take
them
but
i
did
do
it
i
saw
that
i
had
met
a
philosopher
and
i
decided
that
i
would
stop
and
wrestle
with
him
and
not
let
him
go
without
his
story
something
like
jacob
was
it
with
the
angel
do
you
do
all
this
without
payment
he
looked
at
me
in
an
injured
way
who
pay
me
he
asked
mostly
people
think
me
a
sort
of
fool
oh
i
know
but
i
do
mind
i
live
by
the
word
no
nobody
pays
me
i
am
paying
myself
by
this
time
he
was
ready
to
start
so
i
said
friend
i
going
your
way
and
i
walk
with
you
so
we
set
off
together
down
the
hill
you
see
sir
he
said
when
a
man
has
got
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
finds
it
free
he
naturally
wants
to
let
other
people
know
about
it
he
walked
with
the
unmistakable
step
of
those
who
knew
the
long
road
an
easy
swinging
steady
step
carrying
his
small
black
bag
so
i
gradually
drew
him
out
and
when
i
had
his
whole
story
it
was
as
simple
and
common
but
as
wonderful
as
daylight
as
fundamental
as
a
tree
or
a
rock
you
see
mister
he
said
i
was
a
wild
sort
when
i
was
young
the
drink
and
worse
i
hear
folks
say
sometimes
that
if
they
known
what
was
right
they
have
done
it
but
i
think
that
conscience
never
stops
ringing
little
bells
in
the
back
of
a
man
head
and
that
if
he
do
what
is
right
it
because
he
to
do
what
is
wrong
he
thinks
it
more
amusing
and
interesting
i
went
through
all
that
mister
and
plenty
more
besides
i
got
pretty
nearly
as
low
as
a
man
ever
gets
oh
i
was
down
and
out
no
home
no
family
not
a
friend
that
wanted
to
see
me
if
you
never
got
down
that
low
mister
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
are
just
as
much
dead
as
if
you
were
in
your
grave
i
telling
you
i
thought
there
was
no
help
for
me
and
i
do
know
i
wanted
to
be
helped
i
said
to
myself
just
naturally
born
weak
and
it
your
fault
it
makes
a
lot
of
men
easier
in
their
minds
to
lay
up
their
troubles
to
the
way
they
are
born
i
made
all
sorts
of
excuses
for
myself
but
all
the
time
i
knew
i
was
wrong
a
man
ca
fool
himself
so
it
went
along
for
years
i
got
married
and
we
had
a
little
girl
he
paused
for
a
long
moment
i
thought
was
going
to
help
me
i
thought
the
world
and
all
of
that
little
girl
he
paused
again
well
died
then
i
broke
my
wife
heart
and
went
on
down
to
hell
when
a
man
lets
go
that
way
he
kills
everything
he
loves
and
everything
that
loves
him
he
on
the
road
to
loneliness
and
despair
that
man
i
telling
you
one
day
ten
years
ago
this
fall
i
was
going
along
the
main
street
in
quinceyville
i
was
near
the
end
of
my
rope
not
even
money
enough
to
buy
drink
with
and
yet
i
was
then
half
drunk
i
happened
to
look
up
on
the
end
of
that
stone
wall
near
the
bridge
were
you
ever
there
mister
and
i
saw
the
words
is
love
painted
there
it
somehow
hit
me
hard
i
could
anyways
get
it
out
of
my
mind
is
love
well
says
i
to
myself
if
god
is
love
he
the
only
one
that
love
for
a
chap
like
me
and
there
no
one
else
big
enough
to
save
me
i
says
so
i
stopped
right
there
in
the
street
and
you
may
believe
it
or
explain
it
anyhow
you
like
mister
but
it
seemed
to
me
a
kind
of
light
came
all
around
me
and
i
said
will
try
god
he
stopped
a
moment
we
were
walking
down
the
hill
all
about
us
on
either
side
spread
the
quiet
fields
in
the
high
air
above
a
few
lacy
clouds
were
drifting
eastward
upon
this
story
of
tragic
human
life
crept
in
pleasantly
the
calm
of
the
countryside
and
i
did
try
him
my
companion
was
saying
and
i
found
that
the
words
on
the
wall
were
true
they
were
true
back
there
and
they
been
true
ever
since
when
i
began
to
be
decent
again
and
got
back
my
health
and
my
job
i
figured
that
i
owed
a
lot
to
god
i
no
orator
and
no
writer
and
i
had
no
money
to
give
says
i
to
myself
i
a
painter
i
help
god
with
paint
so
here
i
am
up
and
down
the
roads
and
mostly
painting
is
love
but
sometimes
ye
and
yawns
i
do
know
much
about
religion
but
i
do
know
that
his
word
is
like
a
fire
and
that
a
man
can
live
by
it
and
if
once
a
man
has
it
he
has
everything
else
he
wants
he
paused
i
looked
around
at
him
again
his
face
was
set
steadily
ahead
a
plain
face
showing
the
marks
of
his
hard
earlier
life
and
yet
marked
with
a
sort
of
high
beauty
the
trouble
with
people
who
are
unhappy
mister
he
said
is
that
they
wo
try
god
i
could
not
answer
my
companion
there
seemed
indeed
nothing
more
to
be
said
all
my
own
speculative
incomings
and
outgoings
how
futile
they
seemed
compared
with
this
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
is
a
it
is
a
pleasant
quiet
spot
my
companion
stopped
and
put
down
his
bag
what
do
you
think
said
he
i
should
paint
here
well
i
said
you
know
better
than
i
do
what
would
paint
he
looked
around
at
me
and
then
smiled
as
though
he
had
a
quiet
little
joke
with
himself
when
in
doubt
he
said
i
always
paint
is
love
i
sure
of
that
of
course
yawns
and
ye
have
to
be
painted
near
towns
but
i
much
rather
paint
is
love
i
left
him
kneeling
there
on
the
bridge
the
bit
of
carpet
under
his
knees
his
two
little
cans
at
his
side
half
way
up
the
hill
i
turned
to
look
back
he
lifted
his
hand
with
the
paint
brush
in
it
and
i
waved
mine
in
return
i
have
never
seen
him
since
though
it
will
be
a
long
long
time
before
the
sign
of
him
disappears
from
our
roadsides
at
the
top
of
the
hill
near
the
painted
boulder
i
climbed
the
fence
pausing
a
moment
on
the
top
rail
to
look
off
across
the
hazy
countryside
warm
with
the
still
sweetness
of
autumn
in
the
distance
above
the
crown
of
a
little
hill
i
could
see
the
roof
of
my
own
home
and
the
barn
near
it
and
the
cows
feeding
quietly
in
the
pastures
ix
the
gunsmith
harriet
and
i
had
the
first
intimation
of
what
we
have
since
called
the
gunsmith
problem
about
ten
days
ago
it
came
to
us
as
was
to
be
expected
from
that
accomplished
spreader
of
burdens
the
scotch
preacher
when
he
came
in
to
call
on
us
that
evening
after
supper
i
could
see
that
he
had
something
important
on
his
mind
but
i
let
him
get
to
it
in
his
own
way
david
he
said
finally
carlstrom
the
gunsmith
is
going
home
to
sweden
at
last
i
exclaimed
mcalway
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
hesitatingly
he
he
is
going
harriet
laughed
then
it
all
decided
she
said
he
is
going
no
said
the
scotch
preacher
it
not
decided
yet
mcalway
has
made
up
his
mind
i
said
whether
carlstrom
is
to
go
or
not
but
the
scotch
preacher
was
in
no
mood
for
joking
david
he
said
did
you
ever
know
anything
about
the
homesickness
of
the
foreigner
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
nodding
his
great
shaggy
head
man
man
how
my
old
mither
greeted
for
scotland
i
mind
how
a
sprig
of
heather
would
bring
the
tears
to
her
eyes
and
for
twenty
years
i
dared
not
whistle
bonnie
doon
or
charlie
is
my
darling
lest
it
break
her
heart
is
a
pain
you
not
had
i
thinking
davy
we
all
know
the
longing
for
old
places
and
old
times
i
said
no
no
david
it
more
than
that
it
the
wanting
and
the
longing
to
see
the
hills
of
your
own
land
and
the
town
where
you
were
born
and
the
street
where
you
played
and
the
house
he
paused
ah
well
it
hard
for
those
who
have
it
but
i
have
heard
carlstrom
refer
to
sweden
for
years
i
said
is
it
homesickness
or
just
old
age
there
ye
have
it
davy
the
nail
right
on
the
head
exclaimed
the
scotch
preacher
is
it
homesickness
or
is
he
just
old
and
tired
with
that
we
fell
to
talking
about
carlstrom
the
gunsmith
i
have
known
him
pretty
nearly
ever
since
i
came
here
now
more
than
ten
years
ago
and
liked
him
well
too
but
it
seemed
as
mcalway
talked
that
evening
as
though
we
were
making
the
acquaintance
of
quite
a
new
and
wonderful
person
how
dull
we
all
are
how
we
need
such
an
artist
as
the
scotch
preacher
to
mould
heroes
out
of
the
common
human
clay
around
us
it
takes
a
sort
of
greatness
to
recognize
greatness
in
an
hour
time
the
scotch
preacher
had
both
harriet
and
me
much
excited
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
matter
was
that
i
promised
to
call
on
carlstrom
the
next
day
when
i
went
to
town
i
scarcely
needed
the
prompting
of
the
scotch
preacher
for
gunshop
has
for
years
been
one
of
the
most
interesting
places
in
town
for
me
i
went
to
it
now
with
a
new
understanding
afar
off
i
began
to
listen
for
carlstrom
hammer
and
presently
i
heard
the
familiar
sounds
there
were
two
or
three
mellow
strokes
and
i
knew
that
carlstrom
was
making
the
sparks
fly
from
the
red
iron
then
the
hammer
rang
and
i
knew
he
was
striking
down
on
the
cold
steel
of
the
anvil
it
is
a
pleasant
sound
to
hear
carlstrom
shop
is
just
around
the
corner
from
the
main
street
you
may
know
it
by
a
great
wooden
gun
fastened
over
the
doorway
pointing
in
the
daytime
at
the
sky
and
in
the
night
at
the
stars
a
stranger
passing
that
way
might
wonder
at
the
great
gun
and
possibly
say
to
himself
a
gunshop
how
can
a
man
make
a
living
mending
guns
in
such
a
peaceful
community
such
a
remark
merely
shows
that
he
does
know
carlstrom
nor
the
shop
nor
i
tied
my
horse
at
the
corner
and
went
down
to
the
shop
with
a
peculiar
new
interest
i
saw
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
old
wheels
which
have
stood
weathering
so
long
at
one
end
of
the
building
i
saw
under
the
shed
at
the
other
end
the
wonderful
assortment
of
old
iron
pipes
kettles
tires
a
pump
or
two
many
parts
of
farm
machinery
a
broken
water
wheel
and
i
do
know
what
other
flotsam
of
thirty
years
of
diligent
mending
of
the
iron
works
of
an
entire
community
all
this
you
may
say
the
disorder
of
old
iron
the
cinders
which
cover
part
of
the
yard
but
do
not
keep
out
the
tangle
of
goldenrod
and
catnip
and
boneset
which
at
this
time
of
the
year
grows
thick
along
the
neighbouring
fences
all
this
you
say
makes
no
inviting
picture
you
are
wrong
where
honest
work
is
there
is
always
that
which
invites
the
eye
i
know
of
few
things
more
inviting
than
to
step
up
to
the
doors
and
look
into
the
shop
the
floor
half
of
hard
worn
boards
half
of
cinders
the
smoky
rafters
of
the
roof
the
confusion
of
implements
on
the
benches
the
guns
in
the
corners
how
all
of
these
things
form
the
subdued
background
for
the
flaming
forge
and
the
square
chimney
above
it
at
one
side
of
the
forge
you
will
see
the
great
dusty
bellows
and
you
will
hear
its
stertorous
breathing
in
front
stands
the
old
brown
anvil
set
upon
a
gnarly
maple
block
a
long
sweep
made
of
peeled
hickory
wood
controls
the
bellows
and
as
you
look
in
upon
this
lively
and
pleasant
scene
you
will
see
that
the
grimy
hand
of
carlstrom
himself
is
upon
the
hickory
sweep
as
he
draws
it
down
and
lets
it
up
again
with
the
peculiar
rhythmic
swing
of
long
experience
heaping
up
his
fire
with
a
little
iron
paddle
held
in
the
other
hand
he
hums
to
himself
in
a
high
curious
old
voice
no
words
at
all
just
a
tune
of
contented
employment
in
consonance
with
the
breathing
of
the
bellows
and
the
mounting
flames
of
the
forge
as
i
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
the
other
day
before
carlstrom
saw
me
i
wished
i
could
picture
my
friend
as
the
typical
blacksmith
with
the
brawny
arms
the
big
chest
the
deep
voice
and
all
that
but
as
i
looked
at
him
newly
the
scotch
preacher
words
still
in
my
ears
he
seemed
with
his
stooping
shoulders
his
gray
beard
not
very
well
kept
and
his
thin
gray
hair
more
than
ordinarily
small
and
old
i
remember
as
distinctly
as
though
it
were
yesterday
the
first
time
carlstrom
really
impressed
himself
upon
me
it
was
in
my
early
blind
days
at
the
farm
i
had
gone
to
him
with
a
part
of
a
which
i
had
broken
on
one
of
my
stony
hills
can
you
mend
it
i
asked
if
i
had
known
him
better
i
should
never
have
asked
such
a
question
i
saw
indeed
at
the
time
that
i
had
not
said
the
right
thing
but
how
could
i
know
then
that
carlstrom
never
let
any
broken
thing
escape
him
a
watch
or
a
gun
or
a
locomotive
they
are
all
alike
to
him
if
they
are
broken
i
believe
he
would
agree
to
patch
the
wrecked
chariot
of
phaëthon
a
week
later
i
came
back
to
the
shop
come
in
come
in
he
said
when
he
saw
me
he
turned
from
his
forge
set
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
looked
at
me
a
moment
with
feigned
seriousness
so
he
said
you
have
come
for
your
job
he
softened
the
j
in
job
his
whole
speech
indeed
had
the
engaging
inflection
of
the
scandinavian
tongue
overlaid
upon
the
english
words
so
he
said
and
went
to
his
bench
with
a
quick
step
and
an
air
of
almost
childish
eagerness
he
handed
me
the
parts
of
my
without
a
word
i
looked
them
over
carefully
i
ca
see
where
you
mended
them
i
said
you
should
have
seen
his
face
brighten
with
pleasure
he
allowed
me
to
admire
the
work
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
he
had
it
out
of
my
hand
as
if
i
could
be
trusted
with
anything
so
important
and
he
explained
how
he
had
done
it
a
special
tool
for
his
lathe
had
been
found
necessary
in
order
to
do
my
work
properly
this
he
had
made
at
his
forge
and
i
suppose
it
had
taken
him
twice
as
long
to
make
the
special
tool
as
it
had
to
mend
the
parts
of
my
rake
but
when
i
would
have
paid
him
for
it
he
would
take
nothing
save
for
the
mending
itself
nor
was
this
a
mere
rebuke
to
a
doubter
it
had
delighted
him
to
do
a
difficult
thing
to
show
the
really
great
skill
he
had
indeed
i
think
our
friendship
began
right
there
and
was
based
upon
the
favour
i
did
in
bringing
him
a
job
that
i
thought
he
could
do
when
he
saw
me
the
other
day
in
the
door
of
his
shop
he
seemed
greatly
pleased
come
in
come
in
he
said
what
is
this
i
hear
i
said
about
your
going
back
to
sweden
for
forty
years
he
said
i
been
homesick
for
sweden
now
i
an
old
man
and
i
going
home
but
carlstrom
i
said
we
ca
get
along
without
you
who
going
to
keep
us
mended
up
you
have
charles
baxter
he
said
smiling
for
years
there
had
been
a
quiet
sort
of
rivalry
between
carlstrom
and
baxter
though
baxter
is
in
the
country
and
works
chiefly
in
wood
but
baxter
ca
mend
a
gun
or
a
or
a
pump
to
save
his
life
i
said
you
know
that
the
old
man
seemed
greatly
pleased
he
had
the
simple
vanity
which
is
the
right
of
the
true
workman
but
for
answer
he
merely
shook
his
head
i
have
been
here
forty
years
he
said
and
all
the
time
i
have
been
homesick
for
sweden
i
found
that
several
men
of
the
town
had
been
in
to
see
carlstrom
and
talked
with
him
of
his
plans
and
even
while
i
was
there
two
other
friends
came
in
the
old
man
was
delighted
with
the
interest
shown
after
i
left
him
i
went
down
the
street
it
seemed
as
though
everybody
had
heard
of
carlstrom
plans
and
here
and
there
i
felt
that
the
secret
hand
of
the
scotch
preacher
had
been
at
work
at
the
store
where
i
usually
trade
the
merchant
talked
about
it
and
the
postmaster
when
i
went
in
for
my
mail
and
the
clerk
at
the
drug
store
and
the
i
had
known
a
good
deal
about
carlstrom
in
the
past
for
one
learns
much
of
his
neighbours
in
ten
years
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
day
as
though
his
history
stood
out
as
something
separate
and
new
and
impressive
when
he
first
came
here
forty
years
ago
i
suppose
carlstrom
was
not
unlike
most
of
the
foreigners
who
immigrate
to
our
shores
fired
with
faith
in
a
free
country
he
was
poor
as
poor
as
a
man
could
possibly
be
for
several
years
he
worked
on
a
farm
hard
work
for
which
owing
to
his
frail
physique
he
was
not
well
fitted
but
he
saved
money
constantly
and
after
a
time
he
was
able
to
come
to
town
and
open
a
little
shop
he
made
nearly
all
of
his
tools
with
his
own
hands
he
built
his
own
chimney
and
forge
he
even
whittled
out
the
wooden
gun
which
stands
for
a
sign
over
the
door
of
his
shop
he
had
learned
his
trade
in
the
careful
way
not
only
could
he
mend
a
gun
but
he
could
make
one
outright
even
to
the
barrel
and
the
wooden
stock
in
all
the
years
i
have
known
him
he
has
always
had
on
hand
some
such
work
once
i
remember
a
pistol
which
he
was
turning
out
at
odd
times
for
the
very
satisfaction
it
gave
him
he
could
not
sell
one
of
his
guns
for
half
as
much
as
it
cost
him
nor
does
he
seem
to
want
to
sell
them
preferring
rather
to
have
them
stand
in
the
corner
of
his
shop
where
he
can
look
at
them
his
is
the
incorruptible
spirit
of
the
artist
what
a
tremendous
power
there
is
in
work
carlstrom
worked
he
was
up
early
in
the
morning
to
work
and
he
worked
in
the
evening
as
long
as
daylight
lasted
and
once
i
found
him
in
his
shop
in
the
evening
bending
low
over
his
bench
with
a
kerosene
lamp
in
front
of
him
he
was
humming
his
inevitable
tune
and
smoothing
off
with
a
fine
file
the
nice
curves
of
a
rifle
trigger
when
he
had
trouble
and
what
a
lot
of
it
he
has
had
in
his
time
he
worked
and
when
he
was
happy
he
worked
all
the
harder
all
the
leisurely
ones
of
the
town
drifted
by
all
the
children
and
the
fools
and
often
rested
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
he
made
them
all
welcome
he
talked
with
them
but
he
never
stopped
working
clang
clang
would
go
his
anvil
whish
whish
would
respond
his
bellows
creak
creak
would
go
the
hickory
sweep
he
was
helping
the
world
go
round
all
this
time
though
he
had
sickness
in
his
family
though
his
wife
died
and
then
his
children
one
after
another
until
only
one
now
remains
he
worked
and
he
saved
he
bought
a
lot
and
built
a
house
to
rent
then
he
built
another
house
then
he
bought
the
land
where
his
shop
stands
and
rebuilt
the
shop
itself
it
was
an
epic
of
homely
work
he
took
part
in
the
work
of
the
church
and
on
election
days
he
changed
his
coat
and
went
to
the
town
hall
to
vote
illustration
the
children
often
rested
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
in
the
years
since
i
have
known
the
old
gunsmith
and
something
of
the
town
where
he
works
i
have
seen
young
men
born
americans
with
every
opportunity
and
encouragement
of
a
free
country
growing
up
there
and
going
to
waste
one
day
i
heard
one
of
them
sitting
in
front
of
a
store
grumbling
about
the
foreigners
who
were
coming
in
and
taking
up
the
land
the
young
man
thought
it
should
be
prevented
by
law
i
said
nothing
but
i
listened
and
heard
from
the
distance
the
steady
clang
clang
of
carlstrom
hammer
upon
the
anvil
ketchell
the
told
me
how
carlstrom
had
longed
and
planned
and
saved
to
be
able
to
go
back
once
more
to
the
old
home
he
had
left
again
and
again
he
had
got
almost
enough
money
ahead
to
start
and
then
there
would
be
an
interest
payment
due
or
a
death
in
the
family
and
the
money
would
all
go
to
the
banker
the
doctor
or
the
undertaker
of
recent
years
said
ketchell
we
thought
he
given
up
the
idea
his
friends
are
all
here
now
and
if
he
went
back
he
certainly
would
be
disappointed
a
sort
of
serenity
seemed
indeed
to
come
upon
him
his
family
lie
on
the
quiet
hill
old
things
and
old
times
have
grown
distant
and
upon
that
anvil
of
his
before
the
glowing
forge
he
has
beaten
out
for
himself
a
real
place
in
this
community
he
has
beaten
out
the
respect
of
a
whole
town
and
from
the
crude
human
nature
with
which
he
started
he
has
fashioned
himself
wisdom
and
peace
of
mind
and
the
ripe
humour
which
sees
that
god
is
in
his
world
there
are
men
i
know
who
read
many
books
hoping
to
learn
how
to
be
happy
let
me
commend
them
to
carlstrom
the
gunsmith
i
have
often
reflected
upon
the
incalculable
influence
of
one
man
upon
a
community
the
town
is
better
for
having
stood
often
looking
into
the
fire
of
carlstrom
forge
and
seeing
his
hammer
strike
i
do
know
how
many
times
i
have
heard
men
repeat
observations
gathered
in
carlstrom
shop
only
the
other
day
i
heard
the
village
school
teacher
say
when
i
asked
him
why
he
always
seemed
so
merry
and
had
so
little
fault
to
find
with
the
world
why
he
replied
as
carlstrom
the
smith
says
i
feel
like
finding
fault
i
always
begin
with
myself
and
then
i
never
get
any
farther
another
of
carlstrom
sayings
is
current
in
the
country
it
a
good
thing
he
says
when
a
man
knows
what
he
pretends
to
know
the
more
i
circulated
among
my
friends
the
more
i
heard
of
carlstrom
it
is
odd
that
i
should
have
gone
all
these
years
knowing
carlstrom
and
yet
never
consciously
until
last
week
setting
him
in
his
rightful
place
among
the
men
i
know
it
makes
me
wonder
what
other
great
souls
about
me
are
thus
concealing
themselves
in
the
guise
of
familiarity
this
stooped
gray
neighbour
of
mine
whom
i
have
seen
so
often
working
in
his
field
that
he
has
almost
become
a
part
of
the
landscape
who
can
tell
what
heroisms
may
be
locked
away
from
my
vision
under
his
old
brown
hat
on
wednesday
night
carlstrom
was
at
mcalway
house
with
charles
baxter
my
neighbour
horace
and
several
others
and
i
had
still
another
view
of
him
i
think
there
is
always
something
that
surprises
one
in
finding
a
familiar
figure
in
a
wholly
new
environment
i
was
so
accustomed
to
the
carlstrom
of
the
gunshop
that
i
could
not
at
once
reconcile
myself
to
the
carlstrom
of
mcalway
sitting
room
and
indeed
there
was
a
striking
change
in
his
appearance
he
came
dressed
in
the
quaint
black
coat
which
he
wears
at
funerals
his
hair
was
brushed
straight
back
from
his
broad
smooth
forehead
and
his
mild
blue
eyes
were
bright
behind
an
especially
shiny
pair
of
spectacles
he
looked
more
like
some
college
professor
than
he
did
like
a
smith
the
old
gunsmith
had
that
pride
of
humility
which
is
about
the
best
pride
in
this
world
he
was
perfectly
at
home
at
the
scotch
hearth
indeed
he
radiated
a
sort
of
beaming
good
will
he
had
a
native
desire
to
make
everything
pleasant
i
did
not
realize
before
what
a
fund
of
humour
the
old
man
had
the
scotch
preacher
rallied
him
on
the
number
of
houses
he
now
owns
and
suggested
that
he
ought
to
get
a
wife
to
keep
at
least
one
of
them
for
him
carlstrom
looked
around
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
when
i
was
a
poor
man
he
said
and
carried
boxes
from
store
to
help
build
my
first
shop
i
used
to
wish
i
had
a
wheelbarrow
now
i
have
four
when
i
had
no
house
to
keep
my
family
in
i
used
to
wish
that
i
had
one
now
i
have
four
i
have
thought
sometimes
i
would
like
a
wife
but
i
have
not
dared
to
wish
for
one
the
old
gunsmith
laughed
noiselessly
and
then
from
habit
i
suppose
began
to
hum
as
he
does
in
his
shop
stopping
instantly
however
when
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
during
the
evening
the
scotch
preacher
got
me
to
one
side
and
said
david
we
ca
let
the
old
man
go
no
sir
i
said
we
ca
all
he
needs
davy
is
cheering
up
it
a
cold
world
sometimes
to
the
old
i
suppose
the
scotch
preacher
was
saying
the
same
thing
to
all
the
other
men
of
the
company
when
we
were
preparing
to
go
mcalway
turned
to
carlstrom
and
said
how
is
it
carlstrom
that
you
have
come
to
hold
such
a
place
in
this
community
how
is
it
that
you
have
got
ahead
so
rapidly
the
old
man
leaned
forward
beaming
through
his
spectacles
and
said
eagerly
it
ist
america
it
ist
america
no
carlstrom
no
it
is
not
all
america
it
is
carlstrom
too
you
work
carlstrom
and
you
save
every
day
since
wednesday
there
has
been
a
steady
pressure
on
carlstrom
not
so
much
said
in
words
but
people
stopping
in
at
the
shop
and
passing
a
good
word
but
up
to
monday
morning
the
gunsmith
went
forward
steadily
with
his
preparations
to
leave
on
sunday
i
saw
the
scotch
preacher
and
found
him
perplexed
as
to
what
to
do
i
do
know
yet
positively
that
he
had
a
hand
in
it
though
i
suspect
it
but
on
monday
afternoon
charles
baxter
went
by
my
house
on
his
way
to
town
with
a
broken
saw
in
his
buggy
such
is
the
perversity
of
rival
artists
that
i
do
think
charles
baxter
had
ever
been
to
carlstrom
with
any
work
but
this
morning
when
i
went
to
town
and
stopped
at
carlstrom
shop
i
found
the
gunsmith
humming
louder
than
ever
well
carlstrom
when
are
we
to
say
i
asked
i
not
going
he
said
and
taking
me
by
the
sleeve
he
led
me
over
to
his
bench
and
showed
me
a
saw
he
had
mended
now
a
broken
saw
is
one
of
the
high
tests
of
the
genius
of
the
mender
to
put
the
pieces
together
so
that
the
blade
will
be
perfectly
smooth
so
that
the
teeth
match
accurately
is
an
art
which
few
workmen
of
would
even
attempt
charles
baxter
brought
it
in
answered
the
old
gunsmith
unable
to
conceal
his
delight
he
thought
i
could
mend
it
to
the
true
artist
there
is
nothing
to
equal
the
approbation
of
a
rival
it
was
charles
baxter
i
am
convinced
who
was
the
deciding
factor
carlstrom
could
leave
with
one
of
baxter
saws
unmended
but
back
of
it
all
i
know
is
the
hand
and
the
heart
of
the
scotch
preacher
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
think
that
our
gunsmith
possesses
many
of
the
qualities
of
true
greatness
he
has
the
serenity
and
the
humour
and
the
humility
of
greatness
he
has
a
real
faith
in
god
he
works
he
accepts
what
comes
he
thinks
there
is
no
more
honourable
calling
than
that
of
gunsmith
and
that
the
town
he
lives
in
is
the
best
of
all
towns
and
the
people
he
knows
the
best
people
yes
it
greatness
x
the
mowing
now
i
see
the
secret
of
the
making
of
the
best
persons
it
is
to
grow
in
the
open
air
and
to
eat
and
sleep
with
the
earth
this
is
a
well
earned
sunday
morning
my
chores
were
all
done
long
ago
and
i
am
sitting
down
here
after
a
late
and
leisurely
breakfast
with
that
luxurious
feeling
of
irresponsible
restfulness
and
comfort
which
comes
only
upon
a
clean
still
sunday
morning
like
this
after
a
week
of
hard
work
a
clean
sunday
morning
with
clean
clothes
and
a
clean
chin
and
clean
thoughts
and
the
june
airs
stirring
the
clean
white
curtains
at
my
windows
from
across
the
hills
i
can
hear
very
faintly
the
drowsy
sounds
of
early
church
bells
never
indeed
to
be
heard
here
except
on
a
morning
of
surpassing
tranquillity
and
in
the
barnyard
back
of
the
house
harriet
hens
are
cackling
triumphantly
they
are
impiously
unobservant
of
the
sabbath
day
i
turned
out
my
mare
for
a
run
in
the
pasture
she
has
rolled
herself
again
and
again
in
the
warm
earth
and
shaken
herself
after
each
roll
with
an
equine
delight
most
pleasant
to
see
now
from
time
to
time
i
can
hear
her
gossipy
whickerings
as
she
calls
across
the
fields
to
my
neighbour
horace
young
bay
colts
when
i
first
woke
up
this
morning
i
said
to
myself
well
nothing
happened
yesterday
then
i
lay
quiet
for
some
time
it
being
sunday
morning
and
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
all
that
i
had
heard
or
seen
or
felt
or
thought
about
in
that
one
day
and
presently
i
said
aloud
to
myself
why
nearly
everything
happened
yesterday
and
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
interesting
the
more
wonderful
the
more
explanatory
of
high
things
appeared
the
common
doings
of
that
june
saturday
i
had
walked
among
unusual
events
and
had
not
known
the
wonder
of
them
i
had
eyes
but
i
did
not
see
and
ears
but
i
heard
not
it
may
be
it
be
that
the
future
life
of
which
we
have
had
such
confusing
but
wistful
prophecies
is
only
the
reliving
with
a
full
understanding
of
this
marvellous
life
that
we
now
know
to
a
full
understanding
this
day
this
moment
even
here
in
this
quiet
room
would
contain
enough
to
crowd
an
eternity
oh
we
are
children
yet
playing
with
things
much
too
large
for
us
much
too
full
of
meaning
yesterday
i
cut
my
field
of
early
clover
i
should
have
been
at
it
a
full
week
earlier
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
frequent
and
sousing
spring
showers
already
half
the
blossoms
of
the
clover
had
turned
brown
and
were
shriveling
away
into
inconspicuous
seediness
the
leaves
underneath
on
the
lower
parts
of
the
stems
were
curling
up
and
fading
many
of
them
had
already
dropped
away
there
is
a
tide
also
in
the
affairs
of
clover
and
if
a
farmer
would
profit
by
his
crop
it
must
be
taken
at
its
flood
i
began
to
watch
the
skies
with
some
anxiety
and
on
thursday
i
was
delighted
to
see
the
weather
become
clearer
and
a
warm
dry
wind
spring
up
from
the
southwest
on
friday
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
cloud
of
the
size
of
a
man
hand
to
be
seen
anywhere
in
the
sky
not
one
and
the
sun
with
lively
diligence
had
begun
to
make
up
for
the
listlessness
of
the
past
week
it
was
hot
and
dry
enough
to
suit
the
most
exacting
encouraged
by
these
favourable
symptoms
i
sent
word
to
dick
sheridan
by
one
of
horace
men
to
come
over
bright
and
early
on
saturday
morning
my
field
is
only
a
small
one
and
so
rough
and
uneven
that
i
had
concluded
with
dick
help
to
cut
it
by
hand
i
thought
that
on
a
pinch
it
could
all
be
done
in
one
day
harriet
i
said
we
cut
the
clover
that
fortunate
said
harriet
i
already
arranged
to
have
ann
spencer
in
to
help
me
yesterday
morning
then
i
got
out
earlier
than
usual
it
was
a
perfect
june
morning
one
of
the
brightest
and
clearest
i
think
i
ever
saw
the
mists
had
not
yet
risen
from
the
hollows
of
my
lower
fields
and
all
the
earth
was
fresh
with
dew
and
sweet
with
the
mingled
odours
of
growing
things
no
hour
of
the
whole
day
is
more
perfect
than
this
i
walked
out
along
the
edge
of
the
orchard
and
climbed
the
fence
of
the
field
beyond
as
i
stooped
over
i
could
smell
the
heavy
sweet
odour
of
the
clover
blossoms
i
could
see
the
billowy
green
sweep
of
the
glistening
leaves
i
lifted
up
a
mass
of
the
tangled
stems
and
laid
the
palm
of
my
hand
on
the
earth
underneath
it
was
neither
too
wet
nor
too
dry
we
shall
have
good
cutting
i
said
to
myself
so
i
stood
up
and
looked
with
a
satisfaction
impossible
to
describe
across
the
acres
of
my
small
domain
marking
where
in
the
low
spots
the
crop
seemed
heaviest
where
it
was
lodged
and
tangled
by
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
where
in
the
higher
spaces
it
grew
scarce
thick
enough
to
cover
the
sad
baldness
of
the
knolls
how
much
more
we
get
out
of
life
than
we
deserve
so
i
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
field
to
the
orchard
gate
which
i
opened
wide
here
i
said
is
where
we
will
begin
so
i
turned
back
to
the
barn
i
had
not
reached
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
when
who
should
i
see
but
dick
sheridan
himself
coming
in
at
the
lane
gate
he
had
an
old
straw
hat
stuck
resplendently
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
carrying
his
scythe
jauntily
over
his
shoulder
and
whistling
susan
at
the
top
of
his
capacity
dick
sheridan
is
a
cheerful
young
fellow
with
a
thin
brown
face
and
milky
blue
eyes
he
has
an
enormous
adam
apple
which
has
an
odd
way
of
moving
up
and
down
when
he
talks
and
one
large
tooth
out
in
front
his
body
is
like
a
bundle
of
wires
as
thin
and
muscular
and
enduring
as
that
of
a
broncho
pony
he
can
work
all
day
long
and
then
go
down
to
the
at
the
crossing
and
dance
half
the
night
you
should
really
see
him
when
he
dances
he
can
jump
straight
up
and
click
his
heels
twice
together
before
he
comes
down
again
on
such
occasions
he
is
marvellously
clad
as
befits
the
gallant
that
he
really
is
but
this
morning
he
wore
a
faded
shirt
and
one
of
his
suspender
cords
behind
was
fastened
with
a
nail
instead
of
a
button
his
socks
are
sometimes
pale
blue
and
sometimes
lavender
and
commonly
therefore
he
turns
up
his
trouser
legs
so
that
these
vanities
may
not
be
wholly
lost
upon
a
dull
world
his
full
name
is
richard
tecumseh
sheridan
but
every
one
calls
him
dick
a
good
cheerful
fellow
dick
and
a
hard
worker
i
like
him
hello
dick
i
shouted
hello
yourself
grayson
he
replied
he
hung
his
scythe
in
the
branches
of
a
pear
tree
and
we
both
turned
into
the
barnyard
to
get
the
chores
out
of
the
way
i
wanted
to
delay
cutting
as
long
as
i
could
until
the
dew
on
the
clover
should
begin
at
least
to
disappear
by
we
were
ready
for
work
we
rolled
back
our
sleeves
stood
our
scythes
on
end
and
gave
them
a
final
lively
stoning
you
could
hear
the
brisk
sound
of
the
ringing
metal
pealing
through
the
still
morning
air
it
a
great
day
for
haying
i
said
a
dang
good
one
responded
the
laconic
dick
wetting
his
thumb
to
feel
the
edge
of
his
scythe
i
can
not
convey
with
any
mere
pen
upon
any
mere
paper
the
feeling
of
jauntiness
i
had
at
that
moment
as
of
conquest
and
fresh
adventure
as
of
great
things
to
be
done
in
a
great
world
you
may
say
if
you
like
that
this
exhilaration
was
due
to
good
health
and
the
exuberance
of
youth
but
it
was
more
than
that
far
more
i
can
not
well
express
it
but
it
seemed
as
though
at
that
moment
dick
and
i
were
stepping
out
into
some
vast
current
of
human
activity
as
though
we
had
the
universe
itself
behind
us
and
the
warm
regard
and
approval
of
all
men
i
stuck
my
whetstone
in
my
bent
forward
and
cut
the
first
short
sharp
swath
in
the
clover
i
swept
the
mass
of
tangled
green
stems
into
the
open
space
just
outside
the
gate
three
or
four
more
strokes
and
dick
stopped
whistling
suddenly
spat
on
his
hands
and
with
a
lively
here
she
goes
came
swinging
in
behind
me
the
had
begun
at
first
i
thought
the
heat
would
be
utterly
unendurable
and
then
with
dripping
face
and
wet
shoulders
i
forgot
all
about
it
oh
there
is
something
incomparable
about
such
work
the
long
steady
pull
of
willing
and
healthy
muscles
the
mind
undisturbed
by
any
disquieting
thought
the
feeling
of
attainment
through
vigorous
effort
it
was
a
steady
swing
and
swish
swish
and
swing
when
dick
led
i
have
a
picture
of
him
in
my
mind
eye
his
wiry
thin
legs
one
heel
lifted
at
each
step
and
held
rigid
for
a
single
instant
a
glimpse
of
pale
blue
socks
above
his
rusty
shoes
and
three
inches
of
whetstone
sticking
from
his
tight
it
was
good
to
have
him
there
whether
he
led
or
followed
at
each
return
to
the
orchard
end
of
the
field
we
looked
for
and
found
a
gray
stone
jug
in
the
grass
i
had
brought
it
up
with
me
filled
with
cool
water
from
the
pump
dick
had
a
way
of
swinging
it
up
with
one
hand
resting
it
in
his
shoulder
turning
his
head
just
so
and
letting
the
water
gurgle
into
his
throat
i
have
never
been
able
myself
to
reach
this
refinement
in
the
art
of
drinking
from
a
jug
and
oh
the
good
feel
of
a
straightened
back
after
two
long
swathes
in
the
broiling
sun
we
would
stand
a
moment
in
the
shade
whetting
our
scythes
not
saying
much
but
glad
to
be
there
together
then
we
would
go
at
it
again
with
renewed
energy
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
a
working
companion
many
times
that
day
dick
and
i
looked
aside
at
each
other
with
a
curious
sense
of
friendliness
that
sense
of
friendliness
which
grows
out
of
common
rivalries
common
difficulties
and
a
common
weariness
we
did
not
talk
much
and
that
little
of
trivial
matters
jim
brewster
mare
had
a
colt
on
wednesday
this
go
three
tons
to
the
acre
or
i
eat
my
shirt
dick
was
always
about
to
eat
his
shirt
if
some
particular
prophecy
of
his
did
not
materialize
dang
it
all
says
dick
the
moon
drawin
water
something
is
undoubtedly
drawing
it
said
i
wiping
my
dripping
face
a
meadow
lark
sprang
up
with
a
song
in
the
adjoining
field
a
few
heavy
old
bumblebees
droned
in
the
clover
as
we
cut
it
and
once
a
frightened
rabbit
ran
out
darting
swiftly
under
the
orchard
fence
so
the
long
forenoon
slipped
away
at
times
it
seemed
endless
and
yet
we
were
surprised
when
we
heard
the
bell
from
the
house
what
a
sound
it
was
and
we
left
our
cutting
in
the
middle
of
the
field
nor
waited
for
another
stroke
hungry
dick
i
asked
hungry
exclaimed
dick
with
all
the
eloquence
of
a
lengthy
oration
crowded
into
one
word
so
we
drifted
through
the
orchard
and
it
was
good
to
see
the
house
with
smoke
in
the
kitchen
chimney
and
the
shade
of
the
big
maple
where
it
rested
upon
the
porch
and
not
far
from
the
maple
we
could
see
our
friendly
pump
with
the
moist
boards
of
the
in
front
of
it
i
can
not
tell
you
how
good
it
looked
as
we
came
in
from
the
hot
dry
fields
after
you
says
dick
i
gave
my
sleeves
another
roll
upward
and
unbuttoned
and
turned
in
the
moist
collar
of
my
shirt
then
i
stooped
over
and
put
my
head
under
the
pump
spout
pump
dick
said
i
and
dick
pumped
harder
dick
said
i
in
a
strangled
voice
and
dick
pumped
still
harder
and
presently
i
came
up
gasping
with
my
head
and
hair
dripping
with
the
cool
water
then
i
pumped
for
dick
gee
but
that
good
says
dick
harriet
came
out
with
clean
towels
and
we
dried
ourselves
and
talked
together
in
low
voices
and
feeling
a
delicious
sense
of
coolness
we
sat
down
for
a
moment
in
the
shade
of
the
maple
and
rested
our
arms
on
our
knees
from
the
kitchen
as
we
sat
there
we
could
hear
the
engaging
sounds
of
preparation
and
busy
voices
and
the
tinkling
of
dishes
and
agreeable
odours
ah
friend
and
brother
there
may
not
be
better
moments
in
life
than
this
so
we
sat
resting
thinking
of
nothing
and
presently
we
heard
the
screen
door
click
and
ann
spencer
motherly
voice
come
in
now
grayson
and
get
your
dinner
harriet
had
set
the
table
on
the
east
porch
where
it
was
cool
and
shady
dick
and
i
sat
down
opposite
each
other
and
between
us
there
was
a
great
brown
bowl
of
moist
brown
beans
with
crispy
strips
of
pork
on
top
and
a
good
steam
rising
from
its
depths
and
a
small
mountain
of
baked
potatoes
each
a
little
broken
to
show
the
snowy
white
interior
and
two
towers
of
such
new
bread
as
no
one
on
this
earth
or
in
any
other
planet
so
far
as
i
know
but
harriet
can
make
and
before
we
had
even
begun
our
dinner
in
came
the
ample
ann
spencer
quaking
with
hospitality
and
bearing
a
platter
let
me
here
speak
of
it
with
the
bated
breath
of
a
proper
respect
for
i
can
not
even
now
think
of
it
without
a
sort
of
inner
thrill
bearing
a
platter
of
her
most
famous
fried
chicken
harriet
had
sacrificed
the
promising
careers
of
two
young
roosters
upon
the
altar
of
this
important
occasion
i
may
say
in
passing
that
ann
spencer
is
more
celebrated
in
our
neighbourhood
by
virtue
of
her
genius
at
frying
chicken
than
aristotle
or
solomon
or
socrates
or
indeed
all
the
of
the
past
rolled
into
one
so
we
fell
to
with
a
silent
but
none
the
less
fervid
enthusiasm
harriet
hovered
about
us
in
and
out
of
the
kitchen
and
poured
the
tea
and
the
buttermilk
and
ann
spencer
upon
every
possible
occasion
passed
the
chicken
more
chicken
mr
grayson
she
would
inquire
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
made
your
mouth
water
more
chicken
dick
i
ask
more
chicken
grayson
he
would
respond
and
thus
we
kept
up
a
tenuous
but
pleasant
little
joke
between
us
just
outside
the
porch
in
a
thicket
of
lilacs
a
catbird
sang
to
us
while
we
ate
and
my
dog
lay
in
the
shade
with
his
nose
on
his
paws
and
one
eye
open
just
enough
to
show
any
stray
flies
that
he
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
far
away
to
the
north
and
east
one
could
catch
glimpses
if
he
had
eyes
for
such
things
of
the
pleasantness
of
our
countryside
i
soon
saw
that
something
mysterious
was
going
on
in
the
kitchen
harriet
would
look
significantly
at
ann
spencer
and
ann
spencer
who
could
scarcely
contain
her
overflowing
smiles
would
look
significantly
at
harriet
as
for
me
i
sat
there
with
perfect
confidence
in
myself
in
my
ultimate
capacity
as
it
were
whatever
happened
i
was
ready
for
it
and
the
great
surprise
came
at
last
a
a
great
big
red
juicy
buttery
sugary
with
raspberries
heaped
up
all
over
it
when
it
came
in
and
i
am
speaking
of
it
in
that
personal
way
because
it
radiated
such
an
effulgence
that
i
can
not
now
remember
whether
it
was
harriet
or
ann
spencer
who
brought
it
in
when
it
came
in
dick
who
pretends
to
be
abashed
upon
such
occasions
gave
one
swift
glance
upward
and
then
emitted
a
long
low
expressive
whistle
when
beethoven
found
himself
throbbing
with
undescribable
emotions
he
composed
a
sonata
when
keats
felt
odd
things
stirring
within
him
he
wrote
an
ode
to
an
urn
but
my
friend
dick
quite
as
evidently
on
fire
with
his
emotions
merely
whistled
and
then
looked
around
evidently
embarrassed
lest
he
should
have
infringed
upon
the
proprieties
of
that
occasion
harriet
i
said
you
and
ann
spencer
are
benefactors
of
the
human
race
go
now
said
ann
spencer
shaking
all
over
with
pleasure
and
eat
your
shortcake
and
after
dinner
how
pleasant
it
was
to
stretch
at
full
length
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
the
maple
tree
and
look
up
through
the
dusky
thick
shadows
of
the
leaves
if
ever
a
man
feels
the
blissfulness
of
complete
content
it
is
at
such
a
moment
every
muscle
in
the
body
deliciously
resting
and
a
peculiar
exhilaration
animating
the
mind
to
quiet
thoughts
i
have
heard
talk
of
the
hard
work
of
the
but
i
never
yet
knew
a
healthy
man
who
did
not
recall
many
moments
of
exquisite
pleasure
connected
with
the
hardest
and
the
hottest
work
i
think
sometimes
that
the
nearer
a
man
can
place
himself
in
the
full
current
of
natural
things
the
happier
he
is
if
he
can
become
a
part
of
the
universal
process
and
know
that
he
is
a
part
that
is
happiness
all
day
yesterday
i
had
that
deep
quiet
feeling
that
i
was
somehow
not
working
for
myself
not
because
i
was
covetous
for
money
nor
driven
by
fear
not
surely
for
fame
but
somehow
that
i
was
a
necessary
element
in
the
processes
of
the
earth
i
was
a
primal
force
i
was
the
indispensable
harvester
without
me
the
earth
could
not
revolve
oh
friend
there
are
spiritual
values
here
too
for
how
can
a
man
know
god
without
yielding
himself
fully
to
the
processes
of
god
i
yesterday
i
played
my
part
i
took
my
place
and
all
hard
things
grew
simple
and
all
crooked
things
seemed
straight
and
all
roads
were
open
and
clear
before
me
many
times
that
day
i
paused
and
looked
up
from
my
work
knowing
that
i
had
something
to
be
happy
for
at
one
dick
and
i
lagged
our
way
unwillingly
out
to
work
again
rusty
of
muscles
with
a
feeling
that
the
heat
would
now
surely
be
unendurable
and
the
work
impossibly
hard
the
scythes
were
oddly
heavy
and
hot
to
the
touch
and
the
stones
seemed
hardly
to
make
a
sound
in
the
heavy
noon
air
the
cows
had
sought
the
shady
pasture
edges
the
birds
were
still
all
the
air
shook
with
heat
only
man
must
toil
it
danged
hot
said
dick
conclusively
how
reluctantly
we
began
the
work
and
how
difficult
it
seemed
compared
with
the
task
of
the
morning
in
half
an
hour
however
the
reluctance
passed
away
and
we
were
swinging
as
steadily
as
we
did
at
any
time
in
the
forenoon
but
we
said
less
if
that
were
possible
and
made
every
ounce
of
energy
count
i
shall
not
here
attempt
to
chronicle
all
the
events
of
the
afternoon
how
we
finished
the
mowing
of
the
field
and
how
we
went
over
it
swiftly
and
raked
the
long
windrows
into
cocks
or
how
as
the
evening
began
to
fall
we
turned
at
last
wearily
toward
the
house
the
day
work
was
done
dick
had
stopped
whistling
long
before
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
but
now
as
he
shouldered
his
scythe
he
struck
up
my
fairy
fay
with
some
marks
of
his
earlier
enthusiasm
well
dick
said
i
we
had
a
good
day
work
together
you
bet
said
dick
and
i
watched
him
as
he
went
down
the
lane
with
a
pleasant
friendly
feeling
of
companionship
we
had
done
great
things
together
i
wonder
if
you
ever
felt
the
joy
of
utter
physical
weariness
not
exhaustion
but
weariness
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
sat
down
as
i
did
last
night
and
felt
as
though
you
would
like
to
remain
just
there
always
without
stirring
a
single
muscle
without
speaking
without
thinking
even
such
a
moment
is
not
painful
but
quite
the
reverse
it
is
supremely
pleasant
so
i
sat
for
a
time
last
evening
on
my
porch
the
cool
still
night
had
fallen
sweetly
after
the
burning
heat
of
the
day
i
heard
all
the
familiar
sounds
of
the
night
a
whippoorwill
began
to
whistle
in
the
distant
thicket
harriet
came
out
quietly
i
could
see
the
white
of
her
gown
and
sat
near
me
i
heard
the
occasional
sleepy
tinkle
of
a
cowbell
and
the
crickets
were
calling
a
star
or
two
came
out
in
the
perfect
dark
blue
of
the
sky
the
deep
sweet
restful
night
was
on
i
do
know
that
i
said
it
aloud
such
things
need
not
be
said
aloud
but
as
i
turned
almost
numbly
into
the
house
stumbling
on
my
way
to
bed
my
whole
being
seemed
to
cry
out
thank
god
thank
god
xi
an
old
man
today
i
saw
uncle
richard
summers
walking
in
the
town
road
and
can
not
get
him
out
of
my
mind
i
think
i
never
knew
any
one
who
wears
so
plainly
the
garment
of
detached
old
age
as
he
one
would
not
now
think
of
calling
him
a
farmer
any
more
than
one
would
think
of
calling
him
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
no
one
would
think
now
of
calling
him
squire
summers
though
he
bore
that
name
with
no
small
credit
many
years
ago
he
is
no
longer
known
as
hardworking
or
able
or
grasping
or
rich
or
wicked
he
is
just
old
everything
seems
to
have
been
stripped
away
from
uncle
richard
except
age
how
well
i
remember
the
first
time
uncle
richard
summers
impressed
himself
upon
my
mind
it
was
after
the
funeral
of
his
old
wife
now
several
years
ago
i
saw
him
standing
at
the
open
grave
with
his
felt
hat
held
at
his
breast
his
head
was
bowed
and
his
thin
soft
white
hair
stirred
in
the
warm
breeze
i
wondered
at
his
quietude
after
fifty
years
or
more
together
his
nearest
companion
and
friend
had
gone
and
he
did
not
weep
aloud
afterward
i
was
again
impressed
with
the
same
fortitude
or
quietude
i
saw
him
walking
down
the
long
drive
to
the
main
road
with
all
the
friends
of
our
neighbourhood
about
him
and
the
trees
rising
full
and
calm
on
one
side
and
the
still
greenery
of
the
cemetery
stretching
away
on
the
other
half
way
down
the
drive
he
turned
aside
to
the
fence
and
all
unconscious
of
the
halted
procession
he
picked
a
handful
of
the
large
leaves
of
the
wild
grape
it
was
a
hot
day
he
took
off
his
hat
and
put
the
cool
leaves
in
the
crown
of
it
and
rejoined
the
procession
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
mere
forgetfulness
of
old
age
nor
yet
callousness
to
his
own
great
sorrow
it
was
rather
an
instinctive
return
to
the
immeasurable
continuity
of
the
trivial
things
of
life
the
trivial
necessary
things
which
so
often
carry
us
over
the
greatest
tragedies
i
talked
with
the
scotch
preacher
afterward
about
the
incident
he
said
that
he
too
marveling
at
the
old
man
calmness
had
referred
to
it
in
his
presence
uncle
richard
turned
to
him
and
said
slowly
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
have
learned
one
thing
i
have
learned
to
accept
life
since
that
day
i
have
seen
uncle
richard
summers
many
times
walking
on
the
country
roads
with
his
cane
he
always
looks
around
at
me
and
slowly
nods
his
head
but
rarely
says
anything
at
his
age
what
is
there
to
say
that
has
not
already
been
said
his
trousers
appear
a
size
too
large
for
him
his
hat
sets
too
far
down
his
hands
are
long
and
thin
upon
the
head
of
his
cane
but
his
face
is
tranquil
he
has
come
a
long
way
there
have
been
times
of
tempest
and
keen
winds
there
have
been
wild
hills
in
his
road
and
rocky
places
and
threatening
voices
in
the
air
all
that
is
past
now
and
his
face
is
tranquil
i
think
we
younger
people
do
not
often
realize
how
keenly
dependent
we
are
upon
our
contemporaries
in
age
we
get
little
understanding
and
sympathy
either
above
or
below
them
much
of
the
world
is
a
little
misty
to
us
a
little
out
of
focus
uncle
richard
summer
contemporaries
have
nearly
all
gone
mostly
long
ago
one
of
the
last
his
old
wife
at
his
home
i
have
been
there
often
to
see
his
son
he
sits
in
a
large
rocking
chair
with
a
cushion
in
it
and
a
comfortable
high
back
to
lean
upon
no
one
else
ventures
to
sit
in
his
chair
even
when
he
is
not
there
it
is
not
far
from
the
window
and
when
he
sits
down
he
can
lean
his
cane
against
the
wall
where
he
can
easily
reach
it
again
there
is
a
turmoil
of
youth
and
life
always
about
him
of
fevered
incomings
and
excited
outgoings
of
work
and
laughter
and
tears
and
joy
and
anger
he
watches
it
all
for
his
mind
is
still
clear
but
he
does
not
take
sides
he
accepts
everything
refuses
nothing
or
if
you
like
he
refuses
everything
accepts
nothing
he
once
owned
the
house
where
he
now
lives
with
the
great
barns
behind
it
and
the
fertile
acres
spreading
far
on
every
hand
from
his
chair
he
can
look
out
through
a
small
window
and
see
the
sun
on
the
quiet
fields
he
once
went
out
swiftly
and
strongly
he
worked
hotly
he
came
in
wearied
to
sleep
now
he
lives
in
a
small
room
and
that
is
more
than
is
really
necessary
and
when
he
walks
out
he
does
not
inquire
who
owns
the
land
where
he
treads
he
lets
the
hot
world
go
by
and
waits
with
patience
the
logic
of
events
often
as
i
have
passed
him
in
the
road
i
have
wondered
as
i
have
been
wondering
how
he
must
look
out
upon
us
all
upon
our
excited
comings
and
goings
our
immense
concern
over
the
immeasurably
trivial
i
have
wondered
not
without
a
pang
and
a
resolution
whether
i
shall
ever
reach
the
point
where
i
can
let
this
eager
and
fascinating
world
go
by
without
taking
toll
of
it
xii
the
celebrity
not
for
many
weeks
have
i
had
a
more
interesting
more
illuminating
and
when
all
is
told
a
more
amusing
experience
than
i
had
this
afternoon
since
this
afternoon
the
world
has
seemed
a
more
satisfactory
place
to
live
in
and
my
own
home
here
the
most
satisfactory
the
most
central
place
in
all
the
world
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
anything
may
happen
here
we
have
had
a
celebrity
in
our
small
midst
and
the
hills
as
the
psalmist
might
say
have
lifted
up
their
heads
and
the
trees
have
clapped
their
hands
together
he
came
here
last
tuesday
evening
and
spoke
at
the
school
house
i
was
not
there
myself
if
i
had
been
i
should
not
perhaps
have
had
the
adventure
which
has
made
this
day
so
livable
nor
met
the
celebrity
face
to
face
let
me
here
set
down
a
close
secret
regarding
celebrities
can
not
survive
without
common
people
like
you
and
it
follows
that
if
we
do
not
pursue
a
celebrity
sooner
or
later
he
will
pursue
us
he
must
it
is
the
law
of
his
being
so
i
wait
here
very
comfortably
on
my
farm
and
as
i
work
in
my
fields
i
glance
up
casually
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
any
celebrities
are
by
chance
coming
up
the
town
road
to
seek
me
out
oh
we
are
crusty
people
we
farmers
sooner
or
later
they
all
come
this
way
all
the
warriors
and
the
poets
all
the
philosophers
and
the
prophets
and
the
politicians
if
they
do
not
indeed
get
time
to
come
before
they
are
dead
we
have
full
assurance
that
they
will
straggle
along
afterward
clad
neatly
in
sheepskin
or
more
gorgeously
in
green
buckram
with
gilt
lettering
whatever
the
airs
of
pompous
importance
they
may
assume
as
they
come
back
of
it
all
we
farmers
can
see
the
look
of
wistful
eagerness
in
their
eyes
they
know
well
enough
that
they
must
give
us
something
which
we
in
our
commonness
regard
as
valuable
enough
to
exchange
for
a
bushel
of
our
potatoes
or
a
sack
of
our
white
onions
no
poem
that
we
can
enjoy
no
speech
that
tickles
us
no
prophecy
that
thrills
us
neither
dinner
nor
immortality
for
them
and
we
are
yankees
at
our
bargainings
many
a
celebrity
loses
his
puffiness
at
our
doors
this
afternoon
as
i
came
out
on
my
porch
after
dinner
feeling
content
with
myself
and
all
the
world
i
saw
a
man
driving
our
way
in
a
in
the
country
it
is
our
custom
first
to
identify
the
horse
and
that
gives
us
a
sure
clue
to
the
identification
of
the
driver
this
horse
plainly
did
not
belong
in
our
neighbourhood
and
plainly
as
it
drew
nearer
it
bore
the
unmistakable
marks
of
the
town
livery
therefore
the
driver
in
all
probability
was
a
stranger
in
these
parts
what
strangers
were
in
town
who
would
wish
to
drive
this
way
the
man
who
occupied
the
buggy
was
large
and
he
wore
a
black
felt
hat
and
a
black
coat
a
man
evidently
of
some
presence
and
he
drove
slowly
and
awkwardly
not
an
agent
plainly
thus
the
logic
of
the
country
bore
fruitage
harriet
i
said
calling
through
the
open
doorway
i
think
the
honourable
arthur
caldwell
is
coming
here
mercy
me
exclaimed
harriet
appearing
in
the
doorway
and
as
quickly
disappearing
i
did
not
see
her
of
course
but
i
knew
instinctively
that
she
was
slipping
off
her
apron
moving
our
most
celebrated
two
inches
nearer
the
door
and
whisking
a
few
invisible
particles
of
dust
from
the
centre
table
every
time
any
one
of
importance
comes
our
way
or
is
distantly
likely
to
come
our
way
harriet
resolves
herself
into
an
amiable
whirlwind
of
good
order
subsiding
into
placidity
at
the
first
sound
of
a
step
on
the
porch
as
for
me
i
remain
in
my
shirt
sleeves
sitting
on
my
porch
resting
a
moment
after
my
dinner
no
sir
i
will
positively
not
go
in
and
get
my
coat
i
am
an
american
citizen
at
home
in
my
house
with
the
sceptre
of
my
dominion
my
favourite
daily
newspaper
in
my
hand
let
all
kings
queens
and
other
potentates
approach
and
besides
though
i
am
really
much
afraid
that
the
honourable
arthur
caldwell
will
not
stop
at
my
gate
but
will
pass
on
towards
horace
i
am
nursing
a
somewhat
light
opinion
of
caldwell
when
he
spoke
at
the
school
house
on
tuesday
i
did
not
go
to
hear
him
nor
was
my
opinion
greatly
changed
by
what
i
learned
afterward
of
the
meeting
i
take
both
of
our
weekly
county
papers
this
is
necessary
i
add
the
news
of
both
together
divide
by
two
to
strike
a
fair
average
and
then
ask
horace
or
charles
baxter
or
the
scotch
preacher
what
really
happened
the
republican
county
paper
said
of
the
meeting
the
honourable
arthur
caldwell
member
of
congress
who
is
seeking
a
reelection
was
accorded
a
most
enthusiastic
reception
by
a
large
and
sympathetic
audience
of
the
citizens
of
blandford
township
on
tuesday
evening
strangely
enough
the
democratic
paper
observing
exactly
the
same
historic
events
took
this
jaundiced
view
of
the
matter
arty
caldwell
republican
boss
of
the
sixth
district
who
is
out
mending
his
political
fences
spellbound
a
handful
of
his
henchmen
at
the
school
house
near
blandford
crossing
on
tuesday
evening
and
here
was
caldwell
himself
member
of
congress
leader
of
the
sixth
district
favourably
mentioned
for
governor
drawing
up
at
my
gate
deliberately
descending
from
his
buggy
with
dignity
stopping
to
take
the
from
under
the
seat
carefully
tying
his
horse
to
my
i
confess
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
thrill
of
excitement
here
was
a
veritable
celebrity
come
to
my
house
to
explain
himself
i
would
not
have
it
known
of
course
outside
of
our
select
circle
of
friends
but
i
confess
that
although
i
am
a
pretty
independent
person
when
i
talk
in
reality
there
are
few
things
in
this
world
i
would
rather
see
than
a
new
person
coming
up
the
walk
to
my
door
we
can
not
of
course
let
the
celebrities
know
it
lest
they
grow
intolerable
in
their
but
if
they
must
have
us
we
can
not
well
get
along
without
them
without
the
colour
and
variety
which
they
lend
to
a
gray
world
i
have
spent
many
a
precious
moment
alone
in
my
fields
looking
up
the
road
with
what
wistful
casualness
for
some
new
socrates
or
mark
twain
and
i
have
not
been
wholly
disappointed
when
i
have
had
to
content
myself
with
the
travelling
evangelist
or
the
syrian
woman
who
comes
this
way
monthly
bearing
her
pack
of
cheap
suspenders
and
blue
bandana
handkerchiefs
good
afternoon
grayson
said
the
honourable
caldwell
taking
off
his
large
hat
and
pausing
with
one
foot
on
my
step
good
afternoon
sir
i
responded
wo
you
come
up
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
opposite
me
with
a
certain
measured
and
altogether
impressive
dignity
i
can
not
say
that
he
was
exactly
condescending
in
his
manners
yet
he
made
me
feel
that
it
was
no
small
honour
to
have
so
considerable
a
person
sitting
there
on
the
porch
with
me
at
the
same
time
he
was
outwardly
not
without
a
sort
of
patient
deference
which
was
evidently
calculated
to
put
me
at
my
ease
oh
he
had
all
the
arts
of
the
schooled
politician
he
knew
to
the
last
shading
just
the
attitude
that
he
as
a
great
man
a
leader
in
congress
a
dominant
force
in
his
party
a
possible
candidate
for
governor
and
yet
always
a
seeker
for
the
votes
of
the
people
must
observe
in
approaching
a
free
farmer
like
me
sitting
at
ease
in
his
on
his
own
porch
taking
a
moment
rest
after
dinner
it
was
a
perfect
thing
to
see
he
had
evidently
heard
what
was
not
altogether
true
that
i
was
a
questioner
of
authority
a
disturber
of
the
political
peace
and
that
concretely
i
was
opposing
him
for
reëlection
and
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
that
he
was
here
to
lay
down
the
political
law
to
me
he
would
do
it
smilingly
and
patiently
but
firmly
he
would
use
all
the
leverage
of
his
place
his
power
his
personal
appearance
to
crush
the
presumptuous
uprising
against
his
authority
i
confess
my
spirits
rose
at
the
thought
what
in
this
world
is
more
enthralling
than
the
meeting
of
an
unknown
adversary
upon
the
open
field
and
jousting
him
a
tourney
i
felt
like
some
modern
robin
hood
facing
the
panoplied
authority
of
the
king
man
and
what
a
place
and
time
it
was
for
a
combat
in
the
quietude
of
the
summer
afternoon
no
sound
anywhere
breaking
the
still
warmth
and
sweetness
except
the
buzzing
of
bees
in
the
clematis
at
the
end
of
the
porch
and
all
about
the
green
countryside
woods
and
fields
and
old
fences
and
the
brown
road
leading
its
venturesome
way
across
a
distant
hill
toward
the
town
after
explaining
who
he
was
i
told
him
i
had
recognized
him
on
sight
we
opened
with
a
volley
of
small
shot
we
peppered
one
another
with
harmless
comments
on
the
weather
and
the
state
of
the
crops
he
advanced
cabbages
and
i
countered
with
i
am
quite
aware
that
there
are
good
tacticians
who
deprecate
the
use
of
skirmish
lines
and
the
desultory
fire
of
the
musketry
of
small
talk
they
would
advance
in
grim
silence
and
open
at
once
with
the
crushing
fire
of
their
biggest
guns
but
such
fighting
is
not
for
me
i
should
lose
half
the
joy
of
the
battle
and
kill
off
my
adversary
before
i
had
begun
to
like
him
it
would
do
it
would
do
at
all
it
a
warm
day
observes
my
opponent
and
i
take
a
sure
measure
of
his
fighting
form
i
rather
like
the
look
of
his
eye
i
never
saw
the
corn
ripening
better
i
observe
and
let
him
feel
a
little
of
the
cunning
of
the
arrangement
of
my
forces
there
is
much
in
the
tone
of
the
voice
the
cut
of
the
words
the
turn
of
a
phrase
i
can
be
your
servant
with
a
yes
sir
or
your
master
with
a
no
sir
thus
we
warm
up
to
one
another
a
little
at
a
time
we
mass
our
forces
each
sees
the
white
of
his
adversary
eyes
i
can
even
see
my
opponent
with
some
joy
trotting
up
his
reserves
having
found
the
opposition
stronger
than
he
at
first
supposed
i
hear
said
caldwell
finally
with
a
smile
intended
to
be
disarming
that
you
are
opposing
my
reëlection
boom
the
cannon
opening
roar
well
i
replied
also
smiling
and
not
to
be
outdone
in
the
directness
of
my
thrust
i
have
told
a
few
of
my
friends
that
i
thought
gaylord
would
represent
us
better
in
congress
than
you
have
done
boom
the
fight
is
on
you
are
a
republican
are
you
mr
grayson
it
was
the
inevitable
next
stroke
when
he
found
that
i
was
a
doubtful
follower
of
him
personally
he
marshalled
the
authority
of
the
institution
which
he
represented
i
have
voted
the
republican
ticket
i
said
but
i
confess
that
recently
i
have
not
been
able
to
distinguish
republicans
from
democrats
and
i
had
my
doubts
said
i
whether
there
is
any
real
republican
party
left
to
vote
with
i
can
not
well
describe
the
expression
on
his
face
nor
indeed
now
that
the
battle
was
on
horsemen
footmen
and
big
guns
shall
i
attempt
to
chronicle
every
stroke
and
of
that
great
conflict
this
much
is
certain
there
was
something
universal
and
primal
about
the
battle
waged
this
quiet
afternoon
on
my
porch
between
caldwell
and
me
it
was
the
primal
struggle
between
the
leader
and
the
follower
between
the
representative
and
the
represented
and
it
is
a
conflict
when
the
leader
gains
a
small
advantage
the
pendulum
of
civilization
swings
toward
aristocracy
and
when
the
follower
beginning
to
think
beginning
to
struggle
gains
a
small
advantage
then
the
pendulum
inclines
toward
democracy
and
always
and
always
the
leaders
tend
to
forget
that
they
are
only
servants
and
would
be
masters
the
unending
audacity
of
elected
persons
and
always
and
always
there
must
be
a
following
bold
enough
to
prick
the
pretensions
of
the
leaders
and
keep
them
in
their
places
thus
through
the
long
still
afternoon
the
battle
waged
upon
my
porch
harriet
came
out
and
met
the
honourable
caldwell
and
sat
and
listened
and
presently
went
in
again
without
having
got
half
a
dozen
words
into
the
conversation
and
the
bees
buzzed
and
in
the
meadows
the
cows
began
to
come
out
of
the
shade
to
feed
in
the
open
land
gradually
caldwell
put
off
his
air
of
condescension
he
put
off
his
appeal
to
party
authority
he
even
stopped
arguing
the
tariff
and
the
railroad
question
gradually
he
ceased
to
be
the
great
man
favourably
mentioned
for
governor
and
came
down
on
the
ground
with
me
he
moved
his
chair
up
closer
to
mine
he
put
his
hand
on
my
knee
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
see
what
manner
of
man
he
was
to
find
out
how
much
real
fight
he
had
in
him
illustration
he
moved
his
chair
closer
to
mine
you
do
understand
he
said
what
it
means
to
be
down
there
at
washington
in
a
time
like
this
things
clear
to
you
are
not
clear
when
you
have
to
meet
men
in
the
committees
and
on
the
floor
of
the
house
who
have
a
contrary
view
from
yours
and
hold
to
it
just
as
tenaciously
as
you
do
to
your
views
well
sir
he
gave
me
quite
a
new
impression
of
what
a
congressman
job
was
like
of
what
difficulties
and
dissensions
he
had
to
meet
at
home
and
what
compromises
he
had
to
accept
when
he
reached
washington
do
you
know
i
said
to
him
with
some
enthusiasm
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
farming
is
good
enough
for
me
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
uproariously
and
then
moved
up
still
closer
the
trouble
with
you
grayson
he
said
is
that
you
are
looking
for
a
giant
intellect
to
represent
you
at
washington
yes
i
said
i
afraid
i
am
well
he
returned
they
do
happen
along
every
day
i
like
to
see
the
house
of
representatives
full
of
washingtons
and
jeffersons
and
websters
and
roosevelts
but
there
a
lincoln
only
once
in
a
century
he
paused
and
then
added
with
a
sort
of
wry
smile
and
any
quantity
of
caldwells
that
took
me
i
liked
him
for
it
it
was
so
explanatory
the
armour
of
political
artifice
the
symbols
of
political
power
had
now
all
dropped
away
from
him
and
we
sat
there
together
two
plain
and
friendly
human
beings
arriving
through
stress
and
struggle
at
a
common
understanding
he
was
not
a
great
leader
not
a
statesman
at
all
but
plainly
a
man
of
determination
with
a
fair
measure
of
intelligence
and
sincerity
he
had
a
human
desire
to
stay
in
congress
for
the
life
evidently
pleased
him
and
while
he
would
never
be
crucified
as
a
prophet
i
felt
what
i
had
not
felt
before
in
regard
to
him
that
he
was
sincerely
anxious
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
his
constituents
added
to
these
qualities
he
was
a
man
who
was
loyal
to
his
friends
and
not
ungenerous
to
his
enemies
up
to
this
time
he
had
done
most
of
the
talking
but
now
having
reached
a
common
basis
i
leaned
forward
with
some
eagerness
you
wo
mind
i
said
if
i
give
you
my
view
my
common
country
view
of
the
political
situation
i
am
sure
i
do
understand
and
i
think
my
neighbours
here
understand
much
about
the
tariff
or
the
trusts
or
the
railroad
question
in
detail
we
get
general
impressions
and
stick
to
them
like
grim
death
for
we
know
somehow
that
we
are
right
generally
speaking
we
here
in
the
country
work
for
what
we
get
and
sometimes
put
the
big
apples
at
the
top
of
the
barrel
nodded
caldwell
and
sometimes
put
too
much
salt
on
top
of
the
butter
i
added
all
that
but
on
the
whole
we
get
only
what
we
earn
by
the
hard
daily
work
of
ploughing
and
planting
and
reaping
you
admit
that
i
admit
it
said
caldwell
and
we
got
the
impression
that
a
good
many
of
the
men
down
in
new
york
and
boston
and
elsewhere
through
the
advantages
which
the
tariff
laws
and
other
laws
are
giving
them
are
getting
more
than
they
earn
a
lot
more
and
we
feel
that
laws
must
be
passed
which
will
prevent
all
that
now
i
believe
that
too
said
caldwell
very
earnestly
then
we
belong
to
the
same
party
i
said
i
do
know
what
the
name
of
it
is
yet
but
we
both
belong
to
it
caldwell
laughed
and
i
appoint
you
i
said
my
agent
in
washington
to
work
out
the
changes
in
the
laws
well
i
accept
the
appointment
said
caldwell
continuing
very
earnestly
if
you
trust
to
my
honesty
and
not
expect
too
much
of
me
all
at
once
with
that
we
both
sat
back
in
our
chairs
and
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
with
the
greatest
good
humour
and
common
understanding
and
now
said
i
rising
quickly
let
go
and
get
a
drink
of
buttermilk
so
we
walked
around
the
house
arm
in
arm
and
stopped
in
the
shade
of
the
oak
tree
which
stands
near
the
harriet
came
out
in
the
whitest
of
white
dresses
carrying
a
tray
with
the
glasses
and
i
opened
the
door
of
the
and
felt
the
cool
air
on
my
face
and
smelt
the
good
smell
of
butter
and
milk
and
cottage
cheese
and
i
passed
the
cool
pitcher
to
harriet
and
so
we
drank
together
there
in
the
shade
and
talked
and
laughed
i
walked
down
with
caldwell
to
the
gate
he
took
my
arm
and
said
to
me
i
glad
i
came
out
here
and
had
this
talk
i
feel
as
though
i
understood
my
job
better
for
it
let
organize
a
new
party
i
said
let
begin
with
two
members
you
and
i
and
have
only
one
plank
in
the
platform
he
smiled
you
have
to
crowd
a
good
deal
into
that
one
plank
he
said
not
at
all
i
responded
what
would
you
have
it
i
have
it
in
one
sentence
i
said
and
something
like
this
we
believe
in
the
passage
of
legislation
which
shall
prevent
any
man
taking
from
the
common
store
any
more
than
he
actually
earns
caldwell
threw
up
his
arms
grayson
he
said
you
an
outrageous
idealist
caldwell
i
said
you
say
one
of
these
days
that
i
a
practical
politician
well
harriet
i
said
he
got
my
vote
well
david
said
harriet
that
what
he
came
for
it
an
interesting
world
harriet
i
said
it
is
indeed
said
harriet
as
we
stood
on
the
porch
we
could
see
at
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
town
road
crosses
it
the
slow
moving
buggy
and
through
the
open
curtain
at
the
back
the
heavy
form
of
our
congressman
with
his
slouch
hat
set
firmly
on
his
big
head
we
may
be
fooled
harriet
i
observed
on
dogmas
and
doctrines
and
platforms
but
if
we
can
not
trust
human
nature
in
the
long
run
what
hope
is
there
it
men
we
must
work
with
harriet
and
women
said
harriet
and
women
of
course
said
xiii
on
friendship
i
come
now
to
the
last
of
these
adventures
in
friendship
as
i
go
out
i
hope
not
for
long
i
wish
you
might
follow
me
to
the
door
and
then
as
we
continue
to
talk
quietly
i
may
beguile
you
all
unconsciously
to
the
top
of
the
steps
or
even
find
you
at
my
side
when
we
reach
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
lane
i
wish
you
might
hate
to
let
me
go
as
i
myself
hate
to
go
and
when
i
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
if
you
wait
long
enough
you
will
see
me
turn
and
wave
my
hand
and
you
will
know
that
i
am
still
relishing
the
joy
of
our
meeting
and
that
i
part
unwillingly
not
long
ago
a
friend
of
mine
wrote
a
letter
asking
me
an
absurdly
difficult
question
difficult
because
so
direct
and
simple
what
is
friendship
anyway
queried
this
philosophical
correspondent
the
truth
is
the
question
came
to
me
with
a
shock
as
something
quite
new
for
i
have
spent
so
much
time
thinking
of
my
friends
that
i
have
scarcely
ever
stopped
to
reflect
upon
the
abstract
quality
of
friendship
my
attention
being
thus
called
to
the
subject
i
fell
to
thinking
of
it
the
other
night
as
i
sat
by
the
fire
harriet
not
far
away
rocking
and
sewing
and
my
dog
sleeping
on
the
rug
near
me
his
tail
stirring
whenever
i
made
a
motion
to
leave
my
place
and
whether
i
would
or
no
my
friends
came
trooping
into
my
mind
i
thought
of
our
neighbour
horace
the
dryly
practical
and
sufficient
farmer
and
of
our
much
loved
scotch
preacher
i
thought
of
the
shy
and
of
his
boisterous
double
the
bold
i
thought
of
the
old
maid
and
how
she
talks
for
all
the
world
like
a
rabbit
running
in
a
furrow
all
on
the
same
line
until
you
startle
her
out
when
she
slips
quickly
into
the
next
furrow
and
goes
on
running
as
ardently
as
before
and
i
thought
of
john
starkweather
our
rich
man
and
of
the
life
of
the
girl
anna
and
it
was
good
to
think
of
them
all
living
around
me
not
far
away
connected
with
me
through
darkness
and
space
by
a
certain
mysterious
human
cord
oh
there
are
mysteries
still
left
upon
this
scientific
earth
as
i
sat
there
by
the
fire
i
told
them
over
one
by
one
remembering
with
warmth
or
amusement
or
concern
this
or
that
characteristic
thing
about
each
of
them
it
was
the
next
best
thing
to
hearing
the
tramp
of
feet
on
my
porch
to
seeing
the
door
fly
open
letting
in
a
gust
of
the
fresh
cool
air
to
crying
a
hearty
greeting
to
drawing
up
an
easy
chair
to
the
open
fire
to
watching
with
eagerness
while
my
friend
unwraps
exclaiming
all
the
while
of
the
state
of
the
weather
cold
grayson
mighty
cold
and
finally
sits
down
beside
me
not
too
far
away
the
truth
is
my
philosophical
correspondent
i
can
not
formulate
any
theory
of
friendship
which
will
cover
all
the
conditions
i
know
a
few
things
that
friendship
is
not
and
a
few
things
that
it
is
but
when
i
come
to
generalize
upon
the
abstract
quality
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
for
adequate
language
friendship
it
seems
to
me
is
like
happiness
she
flies
pursuit
she
is
shy
and
wild
and
timid
and
will
be
best
wooed
by
indirection
quite
unexpectedly
sometimes
as
we
pass
in
the
open
road
she
puts
her
hand
in
ours
like
a
child
friendship
is
neither
a
formality
nor
a
mode
it
is
rather
a
life
many
and
many
a
time
i
have
seen
charles
baxter
at
work
in
his
just
working
or
talking
in
his
quiet
voice
or
looking
around
occasionally
through
his
spectacles
and
i
have
had
the
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
go
over
and
sit
on
the
bench
near
him
he
literally
talks
me
over
i
even
want
to
touch
him
it
is
not
the
substance
of
what
we
say
to
one
another
that
makes
us
friends
nor
yet
the
manner
of
saying
it
nor
is
it
what
you
do
or
i
do
nor
is
it
what
i
give
you
or
you
give
me
nor
is
it
because
we
chance
to
belong
to
the
same
church
or
society
or
party
that
makes
us
friendly
nor
is
it
because
we
entertain
the
same
views
or
respond
to
the
same
emotions
all
these
things
may
serve
to
bring
us
nearer
together
but
no
one
of
them
can
of
itself
kindle
the
divine
fire
of
friendship
a
friend
is
one
with
whom
we
are
fond
of
being
when
no
business
is
afoot
nor
any
entertainment
contemplated
a
man
may
well
be
silent
with
a
friend
i
do
not
need
to
ask
the
wounded
person
how
he
feels
says
the
poet
i
myself
became
the
wounded
person
not
all
people
come
to
friendship
in
the
same
way
some
possess
a
veritable
genius
for
intimacy
and
will
be
making
a
dozen
friends
where
i
make
one
our
scotch
preacher
is
such
a
person
i
never
knew
any
man
with
a
gift
of
intimacy
so
persuasive
as
his
he
is
so
simple
and
direct
that
he
cuts
through
the
stoniest
reserve
and
strikes
at
once
upon
those
personal
things
which
with
all
of
us
are
so
far
more
real
than
any
outward
interest
friend
i
have
heard
him
say
to
a
total
stranger
and
within
half
an
hour
they
had
their
heads
together
and
were
talking
of
things
which
make
men
cry
it
is
an
extraordinary
gift
as
for
me
i
confess
it
to
be
a
selfish
interest
or
curiosity
which
causes
me
to
stop
almost
any
man
by
the
way
and
to
take
something
of
what
he
has
because
it
pleases
me
to
do
so
i
try
to
pay
in
coin
as
good
as
i
get
but
i
recognize
it
as
a
lawless
procedure
for
the
coin
i
give
being
such
as
i
myself
secretly
make
is
for
them
sometimes
only
spurious
metal
while
what
i
get
is
for
me
the
very
treasure
of
the
indies
for
a
lift
in
my
wagon
a
drink
at
the
door
a
flying
word
across
my
fences
i
have
taken
argosies
of
minted
wealth
especially
do
i
enjoy
all
travelling
people
i
wait
for
them
how
eagerly
here
on
my
farm
i
watch
the
world
drift
by
in
daily
tides
upon
the
road
flowing
outward
in
the
morning
toward
the
town
and
as
surely
at
evening
drifting
back
again
i
look
out
with
a
pleasure
impossible
to
convey
upon
those
who
come
this
way
from
the
town
the
syrian
woman
going
by
in
the
gray
town
road
with
her
and
her
pack
and
the
with
his
dusty
wagon
jangling
his
little
bells
and
the
cheerful
weazened
in
his
faded
hat
and
the
signman
with
his
mouth
full
of
nails
how
they
are
all
marked
upon
by
the
town
all
dusted
with
the
rosy
bloom
of
human
experience
how
often
in
fancy
i
have
pursued
them
down
the
valley
and
watched
them
until
they
drifted
out
of
sight
beyond
the
hill
or
how
often
i
have
stopped
them
or
they
too
willingly
have
stopped
me
and
we
have
fenced
and
parried
with
fine
bold
words
if
you
should
ever
come
by
my
farm
you
whoever
you
are
take
care
lest
i
board
you
hoist
my
pirate
flag
and
sail
you
away
to
the
enchanted
isle
where
i
make
my
rendezvous
it
is
not
short
of
miraculous
how
with
cultivation
one
capacity
for
friendship
increases
once
i
myself
had
scarcely
room
in
my
heart
for
a
single
friend
who
am
now
so
wealthy
in
friendships
it
is
a
phenomenon
worthy
of
consideration
by
all
hardened
disbelievers
in
that
which
is
miraculous
upon
this
earth
that
when
a
man
heart
really
opens
to
a
friend
he
finds
there
room
for
two
and
when
he
takes
in
the
second
behold
the
skies
lift
and
the
earth
grows
wider
and
he
finds
there
room
for
two
more
in
a
curious
passage
which
i
understand
no
longer
darkly
old
mystical
swedenborg
tells
of
his
wonderment
that
the
world
of
spirits
which
he
says
he
visited
so
familiarly
should
not
soon
become
too
small
for
all
the
swelling
hosts
of
its
ethereal
inhabitants
and
was
confronted
with
the
discovery
that
the
more
angels
there
were
the
more
heaven
to
hold
them
so
let
it
be
with
our
friendships
the
end
