bagatelle

to
visit
at
the
parsonage
but
i
mostly
met
her
when
i
went
to
the
lighthouse
to
see
her
father
wangel
those
times
out
there
you
may
believe
me
have
set
deep
marks
upon
her
the
people
in
the
town
here
ca
understand
her
at
all
they
call
her
the
lady
from
the
sea
arnholm
do
they
wangel
yes
and
so
now
you
see
speak
to
her
of
the
old
days
dear
arnholm
it
will
do
her
good
arnholm
looks
at
him
in
doubt
have
you
any
reason
for
thinking
so
wangel
assuredly
i
have
ellida
her
voice
is
heard
outside
the
garden
are
you
there
wangel
wangel
rising
yes
dear
ellida
wangel
in
a
large
light
wrap
and
with
wet
hair
hanging
loose
over
her
shoulders
comes
from
between
the
trees
of
the
arbour
arnholm
rises
wangel
smiling
and
holding
out
his
hands
to
her
ah
so
now
we
have
our
mermaid
ellida
goes
quickly
up
the
verandah
and
seizes
his
hands
thank
god
that
i
see
you
again
when
did
you
come
wangel
just
now
a
little
while
since
pointing
to
arnholm
but
you
greet
an
old
acquaintance
ellida
holding
out
her
hand
to
arnholm
so
here
you
are
welcome
and
forgive
me
for
not
being
at
home
arnholm
do
mention
it
do
stand
on
any
ceremony
wangel
was
the
water
nice
and
fresh
today
ellida
fresh
oh
the
water
here
never
is
fresh
it
is
so
tepid
and
lifeless
ugh
the
water
in
the
fjord
here
is
sick
arnholm
sick
ellida
yes
sick
and
i
believe
it
makes
one
sick
too
wangel
smiling
you
giving
our
bathing
resort
a
good
name
arnholm
i
should
rather
believe
wangel
that
you
have
a
peculiar
relation
to
the
sea
and
to
all
that
belongs
to
it
ellida
perhaps
i
almost
think
so
myself
but
do
you
see
how
festively
the
girls
have
arranged
everything
in
your
honour
wangel
embarrassed
hm
looks
at
his
watch
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
quick
and
arnholm
is
it
really
for
me
ellida
yes
you
may
be
sure
we
do
decorate
like
this
every
day
ugh
how
suffocatingly
hot
it
is
under
this
roof
goes
down
into
the
garden
come
over
here
here
at
least
there
is
a
little
air
sits
down
in
arbour
arnholm
going
thither
i
think
the
air
quite
fresh
here
ellida
yes
you
who
are
used
to
the
stifling
air
of
the
town
terrible
there
in
the
summer
i
hear
wangel
who
has
also
gone
into
the
garden
hm
dear
ellida
you
must
just
entertain
our
friend
alone
for
a
little
while
ellida
are
you
busy
wangel
yes
i
must
go
down
to
the
office
and
then
i
must
change
but
i
wo
be
long
arnholm
sitting
down
in
arbour
now
do
hurry
dear
doctor
your
wife
and
i
will
manage
to
kill
the
time
wangel
nodding
oh
yes
i
sure
you
will
well
goodbye
for
the
present
he
goes
out
through
the
garden
ellida
after
a
short
pause
do
you
think
it
pleasant
sitting
out
here
arnholm
i
think
i
a
pleasant
seat
now
ellida
they
call
this
my
arbour
because
i
had
it
fitted
up
or
rather
wangel
did
for
me
arnholm
and
you
usually
sit
here
ellida
yes
i
pass
most
of
the
day
here
arnholm
with
the
girls
i
suppose
ellida
no
the
girls
usually
sit
on
the
verandah
arnholm
and
wangel
himself
ellida
oh
wangel
goes
to
and
fro
now
he
comes
to
me
and
then
he
goes
to
his
children
arnholm
and
is
it
you
who
wish
this
ellida
i
think
all
parties
feel
most
comfortable
in
this
way
you
know
we
can
talk
across
to
one
another
if
we
happen
to
find
there
is
anything
to
say
arnholm
after
thinking
awhile
when
i
last
crossed
your
path
out
at
skjoldviken
i
mean
hm
that
is
long
ago
now
ellida
it
quite
ten
years
since
you
were
there
with
us
arnholm
yes
about
that
but
when
i
think
of
you
out
there
in
the
lighthouse
the
heathen
as
the
old
clergyman
called
you
because
your
father
had
named
you
as
he
said
after
an
old
ship
and
had
given
you
a
name
fit
for
a
christian
ellida
well
what
then
arnholm
the
last
thing
i
should
then
have
believed
was
that
i
should
see
you
again
down
here
as
the
wife
of
wangel
ellida
no
at
that
time
wangel
was
at
that
time
the
girls
first
mother
was
still
living
their
real
mother
so
arnholm
of
course
of
course
but
even
if
that
had
not
if
he
had
been
free
still
i
could
never
have
believed
this
would
come
about
ellida
nor
i
never
on
earth
then
arnholm
wangel
is
such
a
good
fellow
so
honourable
so
thoroughly
good
and
kind
to
all
men
ellida
warmly
and
heartily
yes
he
is
indeed
arnholm
but
he
must
be
so
absolutely
different
from
you
i
fancy
ellida
you
are
right
there
so
he
is
arnholm
well
but
how
did
it
happen
how
did
it
come
about
ellida
ah
dear
arnholm
you
must
ask
me
about
that
i
explain
it
to
you
and
even
if
i
could
you
would
never
be
able
to
understand
in
the
least
arnholm
hm
in
lower
tone
have
you
ever
confided
anything
about
me
to
your
husband
of
course
i
meant
about
the
useless
step
i
allowed
myself
to
be
moved
to
ellida
no
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
not
said
a
word
to
him
about
about
what
you
speak
of
arnholm
i
am
glad
i
felt
rather
awkward
at
the
thought
that
ellida
there
was
no
need
i
have
only
told
him
what
is
true
that
i
liked
you
very
much
and
that
you
were
the
truest
and
best
friend
i
had
out
there
arnholm
thanks
for
that
but
tell
me
why
did
you
never
write
to
me
after
i
had
gone
away
ellida
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
pain
you
to
hear
from
one
who
who
could
not
respond
as
you
desired
it
seemed
like
a
painful
subject
arnholm
hm
yes
yes
perhaps
you
were
right
ellida
but
why
did
you
write
arnholm
looks
at
her
and
smiles
half
reproachfully
i
make
the
first
advance
perhaps
expose
myself
to
the
suspicion
of
wanting
to
begin
all
over
again
after
such
a
repulse
as
i
had
had
ellida
oh
no
i
understand
very
well
have
you
never
since
thought
of
forming
any
other
tie
arnholm
never
i
have
been
faithful
to
my
first
memories
ellida
half
jestingly
nonsense
let
the
sad
old
memories
alone
better
think
of
becoming
a
happy
husband
i
should
say
arnholm
i
should
have
to
be
quick
about
it
then
wangel
remember
i
already
i
ashamed
to
say
i
past
ellida
well
all
the
more
reason
for
being
quick
she
is
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
says
earnestly
in
a
low
voice
but
listen
dear
arnholm
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
that
i
could
not
have
told
you
then
to
save
my
life
arnholm
what
is
it
ellida
when
you
took
the
the
useless
step
you
were
just
speaking
of
i
could
not
answer
you
otherwise
than
i
did
arnholm
i
know
that
you
had
nothing
but
friendship
to
give
me
i
know
that
well
enough
ellida
but
you
did
not
know
that
all
my
mind
and
soul
were
then
given
elsewhere
arnholm
at
that
time
ellida
yes
arnholm
but
it
is
impossible
you
are
mistaken
about
the
time
i
hardly
think
you
knew
wangel
then
ellida
it
is
not
wangel
of
whom
i
speak
arnholm
not
wangel
but
at
that
time
out
there
at
skjoldviken
i
remember
a
single
person
whom
i
can
imagine
the
possibility
of
your
caring
for
ellida
no
no
i
quite
believe
that
for
it
was
all
such
bewildering
madness
all
of
it
arnholm
but
tell
me
more
of
this
ellida
oh
it
enough
if
you
know
i
was
bound
then
and
you
know
it
now
arnholm
and
if
you
had
not
been
bound
ellida
well
arnholm
would
your
answer
to
my
letter
have
been
different
ellida
how
can
i
tell
when
wangel
came
the
answer
was
different
arnholm
what
is
your
object
then
in
telling
me
that
you
were
bound
ellida
getting
up
as
if
in
fear
and
unrest
because
i
must
have
someone
in
whom
to
confide
no
no
sit
still
arnholm
then
your
husband
knows
nothing
about
this
ellida
i
confessed
to
him
from
the
first
that
my
thoughts
had
once
been
elsewhere
he
never
asked
to
know
more
and
we
have
never
touched
upon
it
since
besides
at
bottom
it
was
simply
madness
and
then
it
was
over
directly
that
is
to
a
certain
extent
arnholm
rising
only
to
a
certain
extent
not
quite
ellida
yes
yes
it
is
oh
good
heavens
dear
arnholm
it
is
not
what
you
think
it
is
something
so
absolutely
incomprehensible
i
do
know
how
i
could
tell
it
you
you
would
only
think
i
was
ill
or
quite
mad
arnholm
my
dearest
lady
now
you
really
must
tell
me
all
about
it
ellida
well
then
i
try
to
how
will
you
as
a
sensible
man
explain
to
yourself
that
looks
round
and
breaks
off
wait
a
moment
here
a
visitor
lyngstrand
comes
along
the
road
and
enters
the
garden
he
has
a
flower
in
his
and
carries
a
large
handsome
bouquet
done
up
in
paper
and
silk
ribbons
he
stands
somewhat
hesitatingly
and
undecidedly
by
the
verandah
ellida
from
the
arbour
have
you
come
to
see
the
girls
lyngstrand
lyngstrand
turning
round
ah
madam
are
you
there
bows
and
comes
nearer
no
it
not
that
it
not
the
young
ladies
it
you
yourself
wangel
you
know
you
gave
me
permission
to
come
and
see
you
ellida
of
course
i
did
you
are
always
welcome
here
lyngstrand
thanks
and
as
it
falls
out
so
luckily
that
it
a
festival
here
today
ellida
oh
do
you
know
about
that
lyngstrand
rather
and
so
i
should
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
presenting
this
to
wangel
bows
and
offers
her
the
bouquet
ellida
smiling
but
my
dear
lyngstrand
ought
you
to
give
these
lovely
flowers
to
arnholm
himself
for
you
know
it
really
he
lyngstrand
looking
uncertainly
at
both
of
them
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
this
gentleman
it
only
i
only
come
about
the
birthday
wangel
ellida
birthday
you
made
a
mistake
lyngstrand
there
no
birthday
here
today
lyngstrand
smiling
slyly
oh
i
know
all
about
that
but
i
think
it
was
to
be
kept
so
dark
ellida
what
do
you
know
lyngstrand
that
it
is
madam
birthday
ellida
mine
arnholm
looks
questioningly
at
her
today
surely
not
ellida
to
lyngstrand
whatever
made
you
think
that
lyngstrand
it
was
miss
hilde
who
let
it
out
i
just
looked
in
here
a
little
while
ago
and
i
asked
the
young
ladies
why
they
were
decorating
the
place
like
this
with
flowers
and
flags
ellida
well
lyngstrand
and
so
miss
hilde
said
why
today
is
mother
birthday
ellida
mother
i
see
arnholm
aha
he
and
ellida
exchange
a
meaning
look
well
now
that
the
young
man
knows
about
it
ellida
to
lyngstrand
well
now
that
you
know
lyngstrand
offering
her
the
bouquet
again
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
congratulating
you
ellida
taking
the
flowers
my
best
thanks
wo
you
sit
down
a
moment
lyngstrand
ellida
arnholm
and
lyngstrand
sit
down
in
the
arbour
this
birthday
business
was
to
have
been
kept
secret
arnholm
arnholm
so
i
see
it
was
for
us
uninitiated
folk
ellida
putting
down
the
bouquet
just
so
not
for
the
uninitiated
lyngstrand
my
word
i
wo
tell
a
living
soul
about
it
ellida
oh
it
was
meant
like
that
but
how
are
you
getting
on
i
think
you
look
better
than
you
did
lyngstrand
oh
i
think
i
getting
on
famously
and
by
next
year
if
i
can
go
south
ellida
and
you
are
going
south
the
girls
tell
me
lyngstrand
yes
for
i
a
benefactor
and
friend
at
bergen
who
looks
after
me
and
has
promised
to
help
me
next
year
ellida
how
did
you
get
such
a
friend
lyngstrand
well
it
all
happened
so
very
luckily
i
once
went
to
sea
in
one
of
his
ships
ellida
did
you
so
you
wanted
to
go
to
sea
lyngstrand
no
not
at
all
but
when
mother
died
father
would
have
me
knocking
about
at
home
any
longer
and
so
he
sent
me
to
sea
then
we
were
wrecked
in
the
english
channel
on
our
way
home
and
that
was
very
fortunate
for
me
arnholm
what
do
you
mean
lyngstrand
yes
for
it
was
in
the
shipwreck
that
i
got
this
little
weakness
of
my
chest
i
was
so
long
in
the
water
before
they
picked
me
up
and
so
i
had
to
give
up
the
sea
yes
that
was
very
fortunate
arnholm
indeed
do
you
think
so
lyngstrand
yes
for
the
weakness
is
dangerous
and
now
i
can
be
a
sculptor
as
i
so
dearly
want
to
be
just
think
to
model
in
that
delicious
clay
that
yields
so
caressingly
to
your
fingers
ellida
and
what
are
you
going
to
model
is
it
to
be
mermen
and
mermaids
or
is
it
to
be
old
vikings
lyngstrand
no
not
that
as
soon
as
i
can
set
about
it
i
am
going
to
try
if
i
can
produce
a
great
work
a
group
as
they
call
it
ellida
yes
but
what
the
group
to
be
lyngstrand
oh
something
i
experienced
myself
arnholm
yes
yes
always
stick
to
that
ellida
but
what
it
to
be
lyngstrand
well
i
thought
it
should
be
the
young
wife
of
a
sailor
who
lies
sleeping
in
strange
unrest
and
she
is
dreaming
i
fancy
i
shall
do
it
so
that
you
will
see
she
is
dreaming
arnholm
is
there
anything
else
lyngstrand
yes
there
to
be
another
figure
a
sort
of
apparition
as
they
say
it
her
husband
to
whom
she
has
been
faithless
while
he
was
away
and
he
is
drowned
at
sea
arnholm
what
ellida
drowned
lyngstrand
yes
he
was
drowned
on
a
sea
voyage
but
that
the
wonderful
part
of
it
he
comes
home
all
the
same
it
is
and
he
is
standing
by
her
bed
looking
at
her
he
is
to
stand
there
dripping
wet
like
one
drawn
from
the
sea
ellida
leaning
back
in
her
chair
what
an
extraordinary
idea
shutting
her
eyes
oh
i
can
see
it
so
clearly
living
before
me
arnholm
but
how
on
earth
i
thought
you
said
it
was
to
be
something
you
had
experienced
lyngstrand
yes
i
did
experience
that
that
is
to
say
to
a
certain
extent
arnholm
you
saw
a
dead
man
lyngstrand
well
i
do
mean
i
actually
seen
this
experienced
it
in
the
flesh
but
still
ellida
quickly
intently
oh
tell
me
all
you
can
about
it
i
must
understand
about
all
this
arnholm
smiling
yes
that
be
quite
in
your
line
something
that
has
to
do
with
sea
fancies
ellida
what
was
it
lyngstrand
lyngstrand
well
it
was
like
this
at
the
time
when
we
were
to
sail
home
in
the
brig
from
a
town
they
called
halifax
we
had
to
leave
the
boatswain
behind
in
the
hospital
so
we
had
to
engage
an
american
instead
this
new
boatswain
ellida
the
american
lyngstrand
yes
one
day
he
got
the
captain
to
lend
him
a
lot
of
old
newspapers
and
he
was
always
reading
them
for
he
wanted
to
teach
himself
norwegian
he
said
ellida
well
and
then
lyngstrand
it
was
one
evening
in
rough
weather
all
hands
were
on
deck
except
the
boatswain
and
myself
for
he
had
sprained
his
foot
and
could
walk
and
i
was
feeling
rather
low
and
was
lying
in
my
berth
well
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
forecastle
reading
one
of
those
old
papers
again
ellida
well
well
lyngstrand
but
just
as
he
was
sitting
there
quietly
reading
i
heard
him
utter
a
sort
of
yell
and
when
i
looked
at
him
i
saw
his
face
was
as
white
as
chalk
and
then
he
began
to
crush
and
crumple
the
paper
and
to
tear
it
into
a
thousand
shreds
but
he
did
it
so
quietly
quietly
ellida
did
he
say
anything
did
he
speak
lyngstrand
not
directly
but
a
little
after
he
said
to
himself
as
it
were
married
to
another
man
while
i
was
away
ellida
closes
her
eyes
and
says
half
to
herself
he
said
that
lyngstrand
yes
and
think
he
said
it
in
perfect
norwegian
that
man
must
have
learnt
foreign
languages
very
easily
ellida
and
what
then
what
else
happened
lyngstrand
well
now
the
remarkable
part
is
coming
that
i
shall
never
forget
as
long
as
i
live
for
he
added
and
that
quite
quietly
too
but
she
is
mine
and
mine
she
shall
remain
and
she
shall
follow
me
if
i
should
come
home
and
fetch
her
as
a
drowned
man
from
the
dark
sea
ellida
pouring
herself
out
a
glass
of
water
her
hand
trembles
ah
how
close
it
is
here
today
lyngstrand
and
he
said
this
with
such
strength
of
will
that
i
thought
he
must
be
the
man
to
do
it
ellida
do
you
know
anything
about
what
became
of
the
man
lyngstrand
oh
madam
he
certainly
not
living
now
ellida
quickly
why
do
you
think
that
lyngstrand
why
because
we
were
shipwrecked
afterwards
in
the
channel
i
had
got
into
the
longboat
with
the
captain
and
five
others
the
mate
got
into
the
and
the
american
was
in
that
too
and
another
man
ellida
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
them
since
lyngstrand
not
a
word
the
friend
who
looks
after
me
said
so
quite
recently
in
a
letter
but
it
just
because
of
this
i
was
so
anxious
to
make
it
into
a
work
of
art
i
see
the
faithless
so
before
me
and
the
avenger
who
is
drowned
and
who
nevertheless
comes
home
from
the
sea
i
can
see
them
both
so
distinctly
ellida
i
too
rises
come
let
us
go
in
or
rather
go
down
to
wangel
i
think
it
is
so
suffocatingly
hot
she
goes
out
of
the
arbour
lyngstrand
who
has
also
risen
i
for
my
part
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
this
was
only
to
be
a
short
visit
because
of
the
birthday
ellida
as
you
wish
holds
out
her
hand
to
him
goodbye
and
thank
you
for
the
flowers
lyngstrand
bows
and
goes
off
through
the
garden
gate
arnholm
rises
and
goes
up
to
ellida
i
see
well
enough
that
this
has
gone
to
your
heart
wangel
ellida
yes
you
may
well
say
so
although
arnholm
but
still
after
all
it
no
more
than
you
were
bound
to
expect
ellida
looks
at
him
surprised
expect
arnholm
well
so
it
seems
to
me
ellida
expect
that
anyone
should
come
back
again
come
to
life
again
like
that
arnholm
but
what
on
earth
is
it
that
mad
sculptor
sea
story
then
ellida
oh
dear
arnholm
perhaps
it
is
so
mad
after
all
arnholm
is
it
that
nonsense
about
the
dead
man
that
has
moved
you
so
and
i
who
thought
that
ellida
what
did
you
think
arnholm
i
naturally
thought
that
was
only
a
of
yours
and
that
you
were
sitting
here
grieving
because
you
had
found
out
a
family
feast
was
being
kept
secret
because
your
husband
and
his
children
live
a
life
of
remembrances
in
which
you
have
no
part
ellida
oh
no
no
that
may
be
as
it
may
i
have
no
right
to
claim
my
husband
wholly
and
solely
for
myself
arnholm
i
should
say
you
had
ellida
yes
yet
all
the
same
i
have
not
that
is
it
why
i
too
live
in
something
from
which
they
are
shut
out
arnholm
you
in
lower
tone
do
you
mean
you
you
do
not
really
love
your
husband
ellida
oh
yes
yes
i
have
learnt
to
love
him
with
all
my
heart
and
that
why
it
is
so
inexplicable
so
absolutely
inconceivable
arnholm
now
you
must
and
shall
confide
all
your
troubles
to
me
will
you
wangel
ellida
i
can
not
dear
friend

now

any
case
later

moment

arbour

town
a
little
in
the
background
a
beacon
and
a
vane
great
stones
arranged
as
seats
around
the
beacon
and
in
the
foreground
farther
back
the
outer
fjord
is
seen
with
islands
and
outstanding
headlands
the
open
sea
is
not
visible
it
is
a
summer
evening
and
twilight
a
shimmer
is
in
the
air
and
over
the
in
the
far
distance
a
quartette
is
faintly
heard
singing
below
in
the
background
young
townsfolk
ladies
and
gentlemen
come
up
in
pairs
from
the
right
and
talking
familiarly
pass
out
beyond
the
beacon
a
little
after
ballested
enters
as
guide
to
a
party
of
foreign
tourists
with
their
ladies
he
is
laden
with
shawls
and
travelling
bags
ballested
pointing
upwards
with
a
stick
sehen
sie
meine
herrschaften
dort
out
there
liegt
eine
andere
mountain
that
wollen
wir
also
besteigen
and
so
herunter
he
goes
on
with
the
conversation
in
french
and
leads
the
party
off
to
the
left
hilde
comes
quickly
along
the
uphill
path
stands
still
and
looks
back
soon
after
bolette
comes
up
the
same
way
bolette
but
dear
why
should
we
run
away
from
lyngstrand
hilde
because
i
ca
bear
going
uphill
so
slowly
look
look
at
him
crawling
up
bolette
ah
but
you
know
how
delicate
he
is
hilde
do
you
think
it
very
dangerous
bolette
i
certainly
do
hilde
he
went
to
consult
father
this
afternoon
i
should
like
to
know
what
father
thinks
about
him
bolette
father
told
me
it
was
a
thickening
of
the
lungs
or
something
of
the
sort
he
wo
live
to
be
old
father
says
hilde
no
did
he
say
it
fancy
that
exactly
what
i
thought
bolette
for
heaven
sake
do
show
it
hilde
how
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
in
an
undertone
look
here
comes
hans
crawling
up
do
you
think
you
can
see
by
the
look
of
him
that
he
called
hans
bolette
whispering
now
do
behave
you
better
lyngstrand
comes
in
from
the
right
a
parasol
in
his
hand
lyngstrand
i
must
beg
the
young
ladies
to
excuse
me
for
not
getting
along
as
quickly
as
they
did
hilde
have
you
got
a
parasol
too
now
lyngstrand
it
your
mother
she
said
i
was
to
use
it
as
a
stick
i
had
mine
with
me
bolette
are
they
down
there
still
father
and
the
others
lyngstrand
yes
your
father
looked
in
at
the
restaurant
for
a
moment
and
the
others
are
sitting
out
there
listening
to
the
music
but
they
were
coming
up
here
presently
your
mother
said
hilde
stands
looking
at
him
i
suppose
you
thoroughly
tired
out
now
lyngstrand
yes
i
almost
think
i
a
little
tired
now
i
really
believe
i
shall
have
to
sit
down
a
moment
he
sits
on
one
of
the
stones
in
the
foreground
hilde
standing
in
front
of
him
do
you
know
there
to
be
dancing
down
there
on
the
parade
lyngstrand
yes
i
heard
there
was
some
talk
about
it
hilde
i
suppose
you
think
dancing
great
fun
bolette
who
begins
gathering
small
flowers
among
the
heather
oh
hilde
now
do
let
lyngstrand
get
his
breath
lyngstrand
to
hilde
yes
miss
hilde
i
should
very
much
like
to
dance
if
only
i
could
hilde
oh
i
see
have
you
ever
learnt
lyngstrand
no
i
not
but
it
was
that
i
meant
i
meant
i
because
of
my
chest
hilde
because
of
that
weakness
you
said
you
suffered
from
lyngstrand
yes
because
of
that
hilde
are
you
very
sorry
you
that
weakness
lyngstrand
oh
no
i
ca
say
i
am
smiling
for
i
think
it
because
of
it
that
everyone
is
so
good
and
friendly
and
kind
to
me
hilde
yes
and
then
besides
it
not
dangerous
lyngstrand
no
it
not
at
all
dangerous
so
i
gathered
from
what
your
father
said
to
me
hilde
and
then
it
will
pass
away
as
soon
as
ever
you
begin
travelling
lyngstrand
of
course
it
will
pass
away
bolette
with
flowers
look
here
lyngstrand
you
are
to
put
this
in
your
lyngstrand
oh
a
thousand
thanks
miss
wangel
it
really
too
good
of
you
hilde
looking
down
the
path
there
they
are
coming
along
the
road
bolette
also
looking
down
if
only
they
know
where
to
turn
off
no
now
they
going
wrong
lyngstrand
rising
i
run
down
to
the
turning
and
call
out
to
them
hilde
you
have
to
call
out
pretty
loud
bolette
no
it
not
worth
while
you
only
tire
yourself
again
lyngstrand
oh
it
so
easy
going
downhill
goes
off
to
the
right
hilde
yes
looking
after
him
why
he
actually
jumping
and
he
never
remembers
he
have
to
come
up
again
bolette
poor
fellow
hilde
if
lyngstrand
were
to
propose
would
you
accept
him
bolette
are
you
quite
mad
hilde
of
course
i
mean
if
he
were
troubled
with
that
weakness
and
if
he
were
to
die
so
soon
would
you
have
him
then
bolette
i
think
you
better
have
him
yourself
hilde
no
that
i
would
why
he
has
a
farthing
he
has
enough
even
to
keep
himself
bolette
then
why
are
you
always
going
about
with
him
hilde
oh
i
only
do
that
because
of
the
weakness
bolette
i
never
noticed
that
you
in
the
least
pity
him
for
it
hilde
no
i
do
but
i
think
it
so
interesting
bolette
what
is
hilde
to
look
at
him
and
make
him
tell
you
it
is
dangerous
and
that
he
going
abroad
and
is
to
be
an
artist
he
really
believes
it
all
and
is
so
thoroughly
happy
about
it
and
yet
nothing
will
ever
come
of
it
nothing
whatever
for
he
wo
live
long
enough
i
feel
that
so
fascinating
to
think
of
bolette
fascinating
hilde
yes
i
think
it
most
fascinating
i
take
that
liberty
bolette
hilde
you
really
are
a
dreadful
child
hilde
that
just
what
i
want
to
be
out
of
spite
looking
down
at
last
i
should
think
arnholm
liked
coming
turns
round
by
the
way
do
you
know
what
i
noticed
about
arnholm
at
dinner
bolette
well
hilde
just
think
his
hair
beginning
to
come
off
right
on
the
top
of
his
head
bolette
nonsense
i
sure
that
not
true
hilde
it
is
and
then
he
has
wrinkles
round
both
his
eyes
good
gracious
bolette
how
could
you
be
so
much
in
love
with
him
when
he
used
to
read
with
you
bolette
smiling
yes
can
you
believe
it
i
remember
i
once
shed
bitter
tears
because
he
thought
bolette
was
an
ugly
name
hilde
only
to
think
looking
down
no
i
say
do
just
look
down
here
there
the
mermaid
walking
along
and
chatting
with
him
not
with
father
i
wonder
if
those
two
are
making
eyes
at
one
another
bolette
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
how
can
you
stand
there
and
say
such
a
thing
of
her
now
when
everything
was
beginning
to
be
so
pleasant
between
us
hilde
of
course
just
try
and
persuade
yourself
of
that
my
child
oh
no
it
will
never
be
pleasant
between
us
and
her
for
she
does
belong
to
us
at
all
and
we
do
belong
to
her
either
goodness
knows
what
father
dragged
her
into
the
house
for
i
should
wonder
if
some
fine
day
she
went
mad
under
our
very
eyes
bolette
mad
how
can
you
think
such
a
thing
hilde
oh
it
would
be
so
extraordinary
her
mother
went
mad
too
she
died
mad
i
know
that
bolette
yes
heaven
only
knows
what
you
do
poke
your
nose
into
but
now
do
go
chattering
about
this
do
be
good
for
father
sake
do
you
hear
hilde
wangel
ellida
arnholm

lyngstrand

up
from
the
right
ellida

that
direction

wangel

suppose

think

hardly
accessible

grounds

this
has
been
done
during
the
last

well
that
it
ca
go
on
like
this
ellida
what
do
you
propose
instead
wangel
perfect
confidence
dear
a
true
life
together
as
before
ellida
oh
if
that
could
be
but
it
is
so
absolutely
impossible
wangel
i
think
i
understand
you
from
certain
things
you
have
let
fall
now
and
again
ellida
passionately
oh
you
do
not
do
say
you
understand
wangel
yes
yours
is
an
honest
nature
ellida
yours
is
a
faithful
mind
ellida
it
is
wangel
any
position
in
which
you
could
feel
safe
and
happy
must
be
a
completely
true
and
real
one
ellida
looking
eagerly
at
him
well
and
then
wangel
you
are
not
suited
to
be
a
man
second
wife
ellida
what
makes
you
think
that
wangel
it
has
often
flashed
across
me
like
a
foreboding
today
it
was
clear
to
me
the
children
memorial
feast
you
saw
in
me
a
kind
of
accomplice
well
yes
a
man
memories
after
all
can
not
be
wiped
out
not
so
mine
anyhow
it
is
in
me
ellida
i
know
that
oh
i
know
that
so
well
wangel
but
you
are
mistaken
all
the
same
to
you
it
is
almost
as
if
the
children
mother
were
still
living
as
if
she
were
still
here
invisible
amongst
us
you
think
my
heart
is
equally
divided
between
you
and
her
it
is
this
thought
that
shocks
you
you
see
something
immoral
in
our
relation
and
that
is
why
you
no
longer
can
or
will
live
with
me
as
my
wife
ellida
rising
have
you
seen
all
that
wangel
seen
into
all
this
wangel
yes
today
i
have
at
last
seen
to
the
very
heart
of
it
to
its
utmost
depths
ellida
to
its
very
heart
you
say
oh
do
not
think
that
wangel
rising
i
see
very
well
that
there
is
more
than
this
dear
ellida
ellida
anxiously
you
know
there
is
more
wangel
yes
you
can
not
bear
your
surroundings
here
the
mountains
crush
you
and
weigh
upon
your
heart
nothing
is
open
enough
for
you
here
the
heavens
above
you
are
not
spacious
enough
the
air
is
not
strong
and
bracing
enough
ellida
you
are
right
night
and
day
winter
and
summer
it
weighs
upon
me
this
irresistible
for
the
sea
wangel
i
know
it
well
dear
ellida
laying
his
hands
upon
her
head
and
that
is
why
the
poor
sick
child
shall
go
home
to
her
own
again
ellida
what
do
you
mean
wangel
something
quite
simple
we
are
going
away
ellida
going
away
wangel
yes
somewhere
by
the
open
sea
a
place
where
you
can
find
a
true
home
after
your
own
heart
ellida
oh
dear
do
not
think
of
that
that
is
quite
impossible
you
can
live
happily
nowhere
on
earth
but
here
wangel
that
must
be
as
it
may
and
besides
do
you
think
i
can
live
happily
here
without
you
ellida
but
i
am
here
and
i
will
stay
here
you
have
me
wangel
have
i
ellida
ellida
oh
do
speak
of
all
this
why
here
you
have
all
that
you
love
and
strive
for
all
your
life
work
lies
here
wangel
that
must
be
as
it
may
i
tell
you
we
are
going
away
from
here
are
going
somewhere
out
there
that
is
quite
settled
now
dear
ellida
ellida
what
do
you
think
we
should
gain
by
that
wangel
you
would
regain
your
health
and
peace
of
mind
ellida
hardly
and
then
you
yourself
think
of
yourself
too
what
of
you
wangel
i
would
win
you
back
again
my
dearest
ellida
but
you
can
not
do
that
no
no
you
ca
do
that
wangel
that
is
the
terrible
part
of
it
to
think
of
wangel
that
remains
to
be
proved
if
you
are
harbouring
such
thoughts
truly
there
is
no
other
salvation
for
you
than
to
go
hence
and
the
sooner
the
better
now
this
is
irrevocably
settled
do
you
hear
ellida
no
then
in
heaven
name
i
had
better
tell
you
everything
straight
out
everything
just
as
it
is
wangel
yes
yes
do
ellida
for
you
shall
not
ruin
your
happiness
for
my
sake
especially
as
it
ca
help
us
in
any
way
wangel
i
have
your
word
now
that
you
will
tell
me
everything
just
as
it
is
ellida
i
tell
you
everything
as
well
as
i
can
and
as
far
as
i
understand
it
come
here
and
sit
by
me
they
sit
down
on
the
stones
wangel
well
ellida
so
ellida
that
day
when
you
came
out
there
and
asked
me
if
i
would
be
yours
you
spoke
so
frankly
and
honestly
to
me
about
your
first
marriage
it
had
been
so
happy
you
said
wangel
and
so
it
was
ellida
yes
yes
i
am
sure
of
that
dear
it
is
not
for
that
i
am
referring
to
it
now
i
only
want
to
remind
you
that
i
on
my
side
was
frank
with
you
i
told
you
quite
openly
that
once
in
my
life
i
had
cared
for
another
that
there
had
been
a
a
kind
of
engagement
between
us
wangel
a
kind
of
ellida
yes
something
of
the
sort
well
it
only
lasted
such
a
very
short
time
he
went
away
and
after
that
i
put
an
end
to
it
i
told
you
all
that
wangel
why
rake
up
all
this
now
it
really
did
concern
me
nor
have
i
once
asked
you
who
he
was
ellida
no
you
have
not
you
are
always
so
thoughtful
for
me
wangel
smiling
oh
in
this
case
i
could
guess
the
name
well
enough
for
myself
ellida
the
name
wangel
out
in
skjoldviken
and
thereabouts
there
were
many
to
choose
from
or
rather
there
was
only
a
single
one
ellida
you
believe
it
was
arnholm
wangel
well
was
it
ellida
no
wangel
not
he
then
i
do
in
the
least
understand
ellida
can
you
remember
that
late
in
the
autumn
a
large
american
ship
once
put
into
skjoldviken
for
repairs
wangel
yes
i
remember
it
very
well
it
was
on
board
that
ship
that
the
captain
was
found
one
morning
in
his
cabin
murdered
i
myself
went
out
to
make
the
ellida
yes
it
was
you
wangel
it
was
the
second
mate
who
had
murdered
him
ellida
no
one
can
say
that
for
it
was
never
proved
wangel
there
was
enough
against
him
anyhow
or
why
should
he
have
drowned
himself
as
he
did
ellida
he
did
not
drown
himself
he
sailed
in
a
ship
to
the
north
wangel
startled
how
do
you
know
ellida
with
an
effort
well
wangel
it
was
this
second
mate
to
whom
i
was
betrothed
wangel
springing
up
what
is
it
possible
ellida
yes
it
is
so
it
was
to
him
wangel
but
how
on
earth
ellida
how
did
you
come
to
betroth
yourself
to
such
a
man
to
an
absolute
stranger
what
is
his
name
ellida
at
that
time
he
called
himself
friman
later
in
his
letters
he
signed
himself
alfred
johnston
wangel
and
where
did
he
come
from
ellida
from
finmark
he
said
for
the
rest
he
was
born
in
finland
had
come
to
norway
there
as
a
child
with
his
father
i
think
wangel
a
finlander
then
ellida
yes
so
he
called
himself
wangel
what
else
do
you
know
about
him
ellida
only
that
he
went
to
sea
very
young
and
that
he
had
been
on
long
voyages
wangel
nothing
more
ellida
no
we
never
spoke
of
such
things
wangel
of
what
did
you
speak
then
ellida
we
spoke
mostly
about
the
sea
wangel
ah
about
the
sea
ellida
about
storms
and
calm
of
dark
nights
at
sea
and
of
the
sea
in
the
glittering
sunshiny
days
we
spoke
also
but
we
spoke
most
of
the
whales
and
the
dolphins
and
the
seals
who
lie
out
there
on
the
rocks
in
the
midday
sun
and
then
we
spoke
of
the
gulls
and
the
eagles
and
all
the
other
sea
birds
i
think
is
it
wonderful
when
we
talked
of
such
things
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
both
the
sea
beasts
and
sea
birds
were
one
with
him
wangel
and
with
you
ellida
yes
i
almost
thought
i
belonged
to
them
all
too
wangel
well
well
and
so
it
was
that
you
betrothed
yourself
to
him
ellida
yes
he
said
i
must
wangel
you
must
had
you
no
will
of
your
own
then
ellida
not
when
he
was
near
ah
afterwards
i
thought
it
all
so
inexplicable
wangel
were
you
often
together
ellida
no
not
very
often
one
day
he
came
out
to
our
place
and
looked
over
the
lighthouse
after
that
i
got
to
know
him
and
we
met
now
and
again
but
then
that
happened
about
the
captain
and
so
he
had
to
go
away
wangel
yes
yes
tell
me
more
about
that
ellida
it
was
just
daybreak
when
i
had
a
note
from
him
he
said
in
it
i
was
to
go
out
to
him
at
the
bratthammer
you
know
the
headland
there
between
the
lighthouse
and
skjoldviken
wangel
i
know
i
know
ellida
i
was
to
go
out
there
at
once
he
wrote
because
he
wanted
to
speak
to
me
wangel
and
you
went
ellida
yes
i
could
not
do
otherwise
well
then
he
told
me
he
had
stabbed
the
captain
in
the
night
wangel
he
said
that
himself
actually
said
so
ellida
yes
but
he
had
only
acted
rightly
and
justly
he
said
wangel
rightly
and
justly
why
did
he
stab
him
then
ellida
he
would
speak
out
about
that
he
said
it
was
not
fit
for
me
to
hear
wangel
and
you
believed
his
naked
bare
word
ellida
yes
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
do
otherwise
well
anyhow
he
had
to
go
away
but
now
when
he
was
to
bid
me
farewell
no
you
never
could
imagine
what
he
thought
of
wangel
well
tell
me
ellida
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
and
drew
a
ring
that
he
always
wore
from
his
finger
and
he
took
a
small
ring
i
had
these
two
he
put
on
the
and
then
he
said
we
should
wed
ourselves
to
the
sea
wangel
wed
ellida
yes
so
he
said
and
with
that
he
threw
the
and
our
rings
with
all
his
might
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
deep
wangel
and
you
ellida
you
did
all
this
ellida
yes
only
think
it
then
seemed
to
me
as
if
it
must
be
so
but
thank
god
i
he
went
away
wangel
and
when
he
was
gone
ellida
oh
you
can
surely
understand
that
i
soon
came
to
my
senses
again
that
i
saw
how
absolutely
mad
and
meaningless
it
had
all
been
wangel
but
you
spoke
just
now
of
letters
so
you
have
heard
from
him
since
ellida
yes
i
have
heard
from
him
first
i
had
a
few
short
lines
from
archangel
he
only
wrote
he
was
going
to
america
and
then
he
told
me
where
to
send
an
answer
wangel
and
did
you
ellida
at
once
i
wrote
him
of
course
that
all
must
be
at
an
end
between
us
and
that
he
must
no
longer
think
of
me
just
as
i
should
no
longer
think
of
him
wangel
but
did
he
write
again
ellida
yes
he
wrote
again
wangel
and
what
was
his
answer
to
your
communication
ellida
he
took
no
notice
of
it
it
was
exactly
as
if
i
had
never
broken
with
him
he
wrote
quite
composedly
and
calmly
that
i
must
wait
for
him
when
he
could
have
me
he
would
let
me
know
and
then
i
was
to
go
to
him
at
once
wangel
so
he
would
not
release
you
ellida
no
then
i
wrote
again
almost
word
for
word
as
i
had
before
or
perhaps
more
firmly
wangel
and
he
gave
in
ellida
oh
no
do
think
that
he
wrote
quietly
as
before
not
a
word
of
my
having
broken
with
him
then
i
knew
it
was
useless
and
so
i
never
wrote
to
him
again
wangel
and
you
never
heard
from
him
ellida
oh
yes
i
have
had
three
letters
since
then
once
he
wrote
to
me
from
california
and
a
second
time
from
china
the
last
letter
i
had
from
him
was
from
australia
he
wrote
he
was
going
to
the
but
since
then
he
has
made
no
sign
wangel
this
man
has
had
a
strange
power
over
you
ellida
ellida
yes
yes
the
terrible
man
wangel
but
you
must
think
of
that
any
more
never
again
never
promise
me
that
my
dear
beloved
ellida
now
we
must
try
another
treatment
for
you
fresher
air
than
here
within
the
fjords
the
salt
fresh
air
of
the
sea
dear
what
say
you
to
that
ellida
oh
do
speak
of
it
do
think
of
it
there
is
no
help
in
this
for
me
i
feel
that
so
well
i
ca
shake
it
off
not
even
there
wangel
what
dear
what
do
you
really
mean
ellida
i
mean
the
horror
of
it
this
incomprehensible
power
over
the
mind
wangel
but
you
have
shaken
it
off
long
since
when
you
broke
with
him
why
all
this
is
long
past
now
ellida
springing
up
no
that
it
is
not
it
is
not
wangel
not
past
ellida
no
wangel
it
is
not
past
and
i
fear
it
never
will
be
never
in
all
our
life
wangel
in
a
pained
voice
do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
your
innermost
heart
you
have
never
been
able
to
forget
this
strange
man
ellida
i
had
forgotten
him
but
then
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
come
back
again
wangel
how
long
ago
is
that
ellida
it
about
three
years
ago
now
or
a
little
longer
it
was
just
when
i
expected
the
child
wangel
ah
at
that
time
yes
ellida
now
i
begin
to
understand
many
things
ellida
you
are
mistaken
dear
what
has
come
to
me
oh
i
believe
nothing
on
earth
will
ever
make
it
clear
wangel
looking
sadly
at
her
only
to
think
that
all
these
three
years
you
have
cared
for
another
man
cared
for
another
not
for
me
but
for
another
ellida
oh
you
are
so
utterly
mistaken
i
care
for
no
one
but
you
wangel
in
a
subdued
voice
why
then
in
all
this
time
have
you
not
lived
with
me
as
my
wife
ellida
because
of
the
horror
that
comes
from
the
strange
man
wangel
the
horror
ellida
yes
the
horror
a
horror
so
terrible
such
as
only
the
sea
could
hold
for
now
you
shall
hear
wangel
the
young
townsfolk
come
back
bow
and
pass
out
to
the
right

them

time
when
i
contracted
this
weakness

do
dance
lyngstrand
no
i
only
look
on
he
goes
out
ellida
johnston
was
on
board
too
i
am
quite
certain
of
it
wangel
what
makes
you
think
so
ellida
without
answering
he
learnt
on
board
that
i
had
married
another
while
he
was
away
and
so
that
very
hour
this
came
over
me
wangel
the
horror
ellida
yes
all
of
a
sudden
i
see
him
alive
right
in
front
of
me
or
rather
a
little
in
profile
he
never
looks
at
me
only
he
is
there
wangel
how
do
you
think
he
looks
ellida
exactly
as
when
i
saw
him
last
wangel
ten
years
ago
ellida
yes
out
there
at
bratthammeren
most
distinctly
of
all
i
see
his
breastpin
with
a
large
pearl
in
it
the
pearl
is
like
a
dead
fish
eye
and
it
seems
to
glare
at
me
wangel
good
god
you
are
more
ill
than
i
thought
more
ill
than
you
yourself
know
ellida
ellida
yes
yes
help
me
if
you
can
for
i
feel
how
it
is
drawing
closer
and
more
close
wangel
and
you
have
gone
about
in
this
state
three
whole
years
bearing
for
yourself
this
secret
suffering
without
confiding
in
me
ellida
but
i
could
not
not
till
it
became
necessary
for
your
own
sake
if
i
had
confided
in
you
i
should
also
have
had
to
confide
to
you
the
unutterable
wangel
unutterable
ellida
no
no
no
do
not
ask
only
one
thing
nothing
more
wangel
when
shall
we
understand
that
mystery
of
the
boy
eyes
wangel
my
dear
love
ellida
i
assure
you
it
was
only
your
own
fancy
the
child
had
exactly
the
same
eyes
as
other
normal
children
have
ellida
no
he
had
not
and
you
could
not
see
it
the
child
eyes
changed
colour
with
the
sea
when
the
fjord
lay
bathed
in
sunshine
so
were
his
eyes
and
so
in
storm
oh
i
saw
it
if
you
did
not
wangel
humouring
her
maybe
but
even
if
it
were
true
what
then
ellida
in
lower
voice
and
coming
nearer
i
have
seen
such
eyes
before
wangel
well
where
ellida
out
at
bratthammeren
ten
years
ago
wangel
stepping
back
what
does
it
mean
ellida
whispers
trembling
the
child
had
the
strange
man
eyes
wangel
cries
out
reluctantly
ellida
ellida
clasps
her
hands
despairingly
about
her
head
now
you
understand
why
i
would
not
why
i
dared
not
live
with
you
as
your
wife
she
turns
suddenly
and
rushes
off
over
the
heights
wangel
hurrying
after
her
and
calling
ellida
ellida
my
poor
unhappy
ellida
act
iii
a
more
remote
part
of
doctor
wangel
garden
it
is
boggy
and
overshadowed
by
large
old
trees
to
the
right
is
seen
the
margin
of
a
dank
pond
a
low
open
fence
separates
the
garden
from
the
footpath
and
the
fjord
in
the
background
beyond
is
the
range
of
mountains
with
its
peaks
it
is
afternoon
almost
evening
bolette
sits
on
a
stone
seat
and
on
the
seat
lie
some
books
and
a
hilde
and
lyngstrand
both
with
walk
along
the
bank
of
the
pond
hilde
making
a
sign
to
lyngstrand
i
can
see
a
large
one
lyngstrand
looking
where
hilde
pointing
ca
you
see
he
down
there
good
gracious
another
looks
through
the
trees
out
there
now
he
coming
to
frighten
him
away
bolette
looking
up
who
coming
hilde
your
tutor
miss
bolette
mine
hilde
yes
goodness
knows
he
never
was
mine
arnholm
enters
from
between
the
trees
arnholm
are
there
fish
in
the
pond
now
hilde
there
are
some
very
ancient
carp
arnholm
no
are
the
old
carp
still
alive
hilde
yes
they
pretty
tough
but
now
we
going
to
try
and
get
rid
of
some
of
them
arnholm
you
better
try
out
there
at
the
fjord
lyngstrand
no
the
pond
is
well
so
to
say
more
mysterious
hilde
yes
it
fascinating
here
have
you
been
in
the
sea
arnholm
yes
i
come
straight
from
the
baths
hilde
i
suppose
you
kept
in
the
enclosure
arnholm
yes
i
not
much
of
a
swimmer
hilde
can
you
swim
on
your
back
arnholm
no
hilde
i
can
to
lyngstrand
let
try
out
there
on
the
other
side
they
go
off
along
the
pond
arnholm
coming
closer
to
bolette
are
you
sitting
all
alone
here
bolette
bolette
yes
i
generally
do
arnholm
is
your
mother
down
here
in
the
garden
bolette
no
she
sure
to
be
out
with
father
arnholm
how
is
she
this
afternoon
bolette
i
do
quite
know
i
forgot
to
ask
arnholm
what
books
have
you
there
bolette
the
one
something
about
botany
and
the
other
a
geography
arnholm
do
you
care
about
such
things
bolette
yes
if
only
i
had
time
for
it
but
first
of
all
i
to
look
after
the
housekeeping
arnholm
does
your
mother
help
you
your
stepmother
does
she
help
with
that
bolette
no
that
my
business
why
i
saw
to
that
during
the
two
years
father
was
alone
and
so
it
has
been
since
arnholm
but
you
as
fond
as
ever
of
reading
bolette
yes
i
read
all
the
useful
books
i
can
get
hold
of
one
wants
to
know
something
about
the
world
for
here
we
live
so
completely
outside
of
all
that
going
on
or
almost
arnholm
now
do
say
that
dear
bolette
bolette
yes
i
think
we
live
very
much
as
the
carp
down
there
in
the
pond
they
have
the
fjord
so
near
them
where
the
shoals
of
wild
fishes
pass
in
and
out
but
the
poor
tame
know
nothing
and
they
can
take
no
part
in
that
arnholm
i
do
think
it
would
fare
very
well
with
them
if
they
could
get
out
there
bolette
oh
it
would
be
much
the
same
i
expect
arnholm
moreover
you
ca
say
that
one
is
so
completely
out
of
the
world
here
not
in
the
summer
anyhow
why
nowadays
this
is
quite
a
rendezvous
for
the
busy
world
almost
a
terminus
for
the
time
being
bolette
ah
yes
you
who
yourself
are
only
here
for
the
time
being
it
is
easy
for
you
to
make
fun
of
us
arnholm
i
make
fun
how
can
you
think
that
bolette
well
all
that
about
this
being
a
rendezvous
and
a
terminus
for
the
busy
world
that
something
you
heard
the
townsfolk
here
saying
yes
they
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
sort
of
thing
arnholm
well
frankly
i
noticed
that
too
bolette
but
really
there
not
an
atom
of
truth
in
it
not
for
us
who
always
live
here
what
good
is
it
to
us
that
the
great
strange
world
comes
hither
for
a
time
on
its
way
north
to
see
the
midnight
sun
we
ourselves
have
no
part
in
that
we
see
nothing
of
the
midnight
sun
no
we
got
to
be
good
and
live
our
lives
here
in
our
carp
pond
arnholm
sitting
down
by
her
now
tell
me
dear
bolette
is
there
something
or
other
something
definite
you
are
longing
for
bolette
perhaps
arnholm
what
is
it
really
what
is
it
you
are
longing
for
bolette
chiefly
to
get
away
arnholm
that
above
all
then
bolette
yes
and
then
to
learn
more
to
really
know
something
about
everything
arnholm
when
i
used
to
teach
you
your
father
often
said
he
would
let
you
go
to
college
bolette
yes
poor
father
he
says
so
many
things
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
he
there
no
real
stamina
in
father
arnholm
no
unfortunately
you
right
there
he
has
not
exactly
stamina
but
have
you
ever
spoken
to
him
about
it
spoken
really
earnestly
and
seriously
bolette
no
i
not
quite
done
that
arnholm
but
really
you
ought
to
before
it
is
too
late
bolette
why
do
you
bolette
oh
i
suppose
it
because
there
no
real
stamina
in
me
either
i
certainly
take
after
father
in
that
arnholm
hm
do
you
think
you
unjust
to
yourself
there
bolette
no
unfortunately
besides
father
has
so
little
time
for
thinking
of
me
and
my
future
and
not
much
desire
to
either
he
prefers
to
put
such
things
away
from
him
whenever
he
can
he
is
so
completely
taken
up
with
ellida
arnholm
with
whom
what
bolette
i
mean
that
he
and
my
stepmother
breaks
off
father
and
mother
suffice
one
another
as
you
see
arnholm
well
so
much
the
better
if
you
were
to
get
away
from
here
bolette
yes
but
i
do
think
i
a
right
to
not
to
forsake
father
arnholm
but
dear
bolette
you
have
to
do
that
sometime
anyhow
so
it
seems
to
me
the
sooner
the
better
bolette
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
after
all
i
must
think
of
myself
too
i
must
try
and
get
occupation
of
some
sort
when
once
father
gone
i
have
no
one
to
hold
to
but
poor
father
i
dread
leaving
him
arnholm
dread
bolette
yes
for
father
sake
arnholm
but
good
heavens
your
stepmother
she
is
left
to
him
bolette
that
true
but
she
not
in
the
least
fit
to
do
all
that
mother
did
so
well
there
is
so
much
she
does
see
or
that
she
see
or
that
she
does
care
about
i
do
know
which
it
is
arnholm
um
i
think
i
understand
what
you
mean
bolette
poor
father
he
is
weak
in
some
things
perhaps
you
noticed
that
yourself
he
has
enough
occupation
either
to
fill
up
his
time
and
then
she
is
so
thoroughly
incapable
of
helping
him
however
to
some
extent
his
own
fault
arnholm
in
what
way
bolette
oh
father
always
likes
to
see
happy
faces
about
him
there
must
be
sunshine
and
joy
in
the
house
he
says
and
so
i
afraid
he
often
gives
her
medicine
which
will
do
her
little
good
in
the
long
run
arnholm
do
you
really
think
that
bolette
yes
i
ca
get
rid
of
the
thought
she
is
so
odd
at
times
passionately
but
is
it
unjust
that
i
should
have
to
stay
at
home
here
really
it
not
of
any
earthly
use
to
father
besides
i
have
a
duty
towards
myself
too
i
think
arnholm
do
you
know
what
bolette
we
two
must
talk
these
matters
over
more
carefully
bolette
oh
that
wo
be
much
use
i
suppose
i
was
created
to
stay
here
in
the
carp
pond
arnholm
not
a
bit
of
it
it
depends
entirely
upon
yourself
bolette
quickly
do
you
think
so
arnholm
yes
believe
me
it
lies
wholly
and
solely
in
your
own
hands
bolette
if
only
that
were
true
will
you
perhaps
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
with
father
arnholm
certainly
but
first
of
all
i
must
speak
frankly
and
freely
with
you
yourself
dear
bolette
looks
out
to
the
left
hush
do
let
them
notice
anything
we
speak
of
this
later
ellida
enters
from
the
left
she
has
no
hat
on
but
a
large
shawl
is
thrown
over
her
head
and
shoulders
ellida
with
restless
animation
how
pleasant
it
is
here
how
delightful
it
is
here
arnholm
rising
have
you
been
for
a
walk
ellida
yes
a
long
long
lovely
walk
up
there
with
wangel
and
now
we
going
for
a
sail
bolette
wo
you
sit
down
ellida
no
thanks
i
wo
sit
down
bolette
making
room
on
seat
here
a
pleasant
seat
ellida
walking
about
no
no
no
i
not
sit
down
not
sit
down
arnholm
i
sure
your
walk
has
done
you
good
you
look
quite
refreshed
ellida
oh
i
feel
so
thoroughly
well
i
feel
so
unspeakably
happy
so
safe
so
safe
looking
out
to
the
left
what
great
steamer
is
that
coming
along
there
bolette
rising
and
also
looking
out
it
must
be
the
large
english
ship
arnholm
it
passing
the
buoy
does
it
usually
stop
here
bolette
only
for
half
an
hour
it
goes
farther
up
the
fjord
ellida
and
then
sails
away
again
tomorrow
away
over
the
great
open
sea
right
over
the
sea
only
think
to
be
with
them
if
one
could
if
only
one
could
arnholm
have
you
never
been
any
long
sea
voyage
wangel
ellida
never
only
those
little
trips
in
the
fjord
here
bolette
with
a
sigh
ah
no
i
suppose
we
must
put
up
with
the
dry
land
arnholm
well
after
all
that
really
is
our
home
ellida
no
i
do
think
it
is
arnholm
not
the
land
ellida
no
i
do
believe
so
i
think
that
if
only
men
had
from
the
beginning
accustomed
themselves
to
live
on
the
sea
or
in
the
sea
perhaps
we
should
be
more
perfect
than
we
are
both
better
and
happier
arnholm
you
really
think
that
ellida
yes
i
should
like
to
know
if
we
should
not
i
often
spoken
to
wangel
about
it
arnholm
well
and
he
ellida
he
thinks
it
might
be
so
arnholm
jestingly
well
perhaps
but
it
ca
be
helped
we
once
for
all
entered
upon
the
wrong
path
and
have
become
land
beasts
instead
of
sea
beasts
anyhow
i
suppose
it
too
late
to
make
good
the
mistake
now
ellida
yes
you
spoken
a
sad
truth
and
i
think
men
instinctively
feel
something
of
this
themselves
and
they
bear
it
about
with
them
as
a
secret
regret
and
sorrow
believe
me
herein
lies
the
deepest
cause
for
the
sadness
of
men
yes
believe
me
in
this
arnholm
but
my
dearest
wangel
i
have
not
observed
that
men
are
so
extremely
sad
it
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
that
most
of
them
take
life
easily
and
pleasantly
and
with
a
great
quiet
unconscious
joy
ellida
oh
no
it
is
not
so
the
joy
is
i
suppose
something
like
our
joy
at
the
long
pleasant
summer
days
it
has
the
presentiment
of
the
dark
days
coming
and
it
is
this
presentiment
that
casts
its
shadows
over
the
joy
of
men
just
as
the
driving
clouds
cast
their
shadow
over
the
fjords
it
lies
there
so
bright
and
blue
and
of
a
sudden
arnholm
you
should
give
way
to
such
sad
thoughts
just
now
you
were
so
glad
and
so
bright
ellida
yes
yes
so
i
was
oh
this
this
is
so
stupid
of
me
looking
about
her
uneasily
if
only
wangel
would
come
he
promised
me
so
faithfully
he
would
and
yet
he
does
not
come
dear
arnholm
you
try
and
find
him
for
me
arnholm
gladly
ellida
tell
him
he
must
come
here
directly
now
for
now
i
ca
see
him
arnholm
not
see
him
ellida
oh
you
do
understand
when
he
is
not
by
me
i
often
remember
how
he
looks
and
then
it
is
as
if
i
had
quite
lost
him
that
is
so
terribly
painful
but
do
go
please
she
paces
round
the
pond
bolette
to
arnholm
i
will
go
with
you
you
do
know
the
way
arnholm
nonsense
i
shall
be
all
right
bolette
aside
no
no
no
i
am
anxious
i
afraid
he
is
on
board
the
steamer
arnholm
afraid
bolette
yes
he
usually
goes
to
see
if
there
are
any
acquaintances
of
his
and
there
a
restaurant
on
board
arnholm
ah
come
then
he
and
bolette
go
off
ellida
stands
still
awhile
staring
down
at
the
pond
now
and
again
she
speaks
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
and
breaks
off
along
the
footpath
beyond
the
garden
fence
a
stranger
in
travelling
dress
comes
from
the
left
his
hair
and
beard
are
bushy
and
red
he
has
a
scotch
cap
on
and
a
travelling
bag
with
strap
across
his
shoulders
the
stranger
goes
slowly
along
by
the
fence
and
peeps
into
the
garden
when
he
catches
sight
of
ellida
he
stands
still
looks
at
her
fixedly
and
searchingly
and
speaks
in
a
low
voice
ellida
ellida
turns
round
with
a
cry
oh
dear
have
you
come
at
last
the
stranger
yes
at
last
ellida
looking
at
him
astonished
and
frightened
who
are

the
stranger
climbs
over
the
fence
and
comes
into
the
garden
well
ellida
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
before
i
go
ellida
wishes
to
fly
but
can
not
she
stands
as
one
paralysed
with
terror
and
leans
for
support
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
by
the
pond
do
touch
me
do
come
near
me
no
nearer
do
touch
me
i
say
the
stranger
cautiously
coming
a
few
steps
nearer
you
need
not
be
so
afraid
of
me
ellida
ellida
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hands
do
look
at
me
like
that
the
stranger
do
not
be
afraid
not
afraid
wangel
comes
through
the
garden
from
the
left
wangel
still
between
the
trees
well
you
had
to
wait
for
me
a
long
while
ellida
rushes
towards
him
clings
fast
to
his
arm
and
cries
out
oh
wangel
save
me
you
save
me
if
you
can
wangel
ellida
what
in
heaven
name
ellida
save
me
wangel
do
you
see
him
there
why
he
is
standing
there
wangel
looking
thither
that
man
coming
nearer
may
i
ask
you
who
you
are
and
what
you
have
come
into
this
garden
for
the
stranger
motions
with
a
nod
towards
ellida
i
want
to
talk
to
her
wangel
oh
indeed
so
i
suppose
it
was
you
to
ellida
i
hear
a
stranger
has
been
to
the
house
and
asked
for
you
the
stranger
yes
it
was
wangel
and
what
do
you
want
with
my
wife
turning
round
do
you
know
him
ellida
ellida
in
a
low
voice
and
wringing
her
hands
do
i
know
him
yes
yes
yes
wangel
quickly
well
ellida
why
it
is
he
wangel
he
himself
he
who
you
know
wangel
what
what
is
it
you
say
turning
are
you
the
johnston
who
once
the
stranger
you
may
call
me
johnston
for
aught
i
care
however
not
my
name
wangel
it
is
not
the
stranger
it
is
no
longer
no
wangel
and
what
may
you
want
with
my
wife
for
i
suppose
you
know
the
daughter
has
been
married
this
long
time
and
whom
she
married
you
of
course
also
know
the
stranger
i
known
it
over
three
years
ellida
eagerly
how
did
you
come
to
know
it
the
stranger
i
was
on
my
way
home
to
you
ellida
i
came
across
an
old
newspaper
it
was
a
paper
from
these
parts
and
in
it
there
was
that
about
the
marriage
ellida
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
the
marriage
so
it
was
that
the
stranger
it
seemed
so
wonderful
to
me
for
the
rings
why
that
too
was
a
marriage
ellida
ellida
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
wangel
how
dare
you
the
stranger
have
you
forgotten
that
ellida
feeling
his
look
suddenly
cries
out
do
stand
there
and
look
at
me
like
that
wangel
goes
up
to
him
you
must
deal
with
me
and
not
with
her
in
short
now
that
you
know
the
circumstances
what
is
it
you
really
want
here
why
do
you
seek
my
wife
the
stranger
i
promised
ellida
to
come
to
her
as
soon
as
i
could
wangel
ellida
again
the
stranger
and
ellida
promised
faithfully
she
would
wait
for
me
until
i
came
wangel
i
notice
you
call
my
wife
by
her
first
name
this
kind
of
familiarity
is
not
customary
with
us
here
the
stranger
i
know
that
perfectly
but
as
she
first
and
above
all
belongs
to
me
wangel
to
you
still
ellida
draws
back
behind
wangel
oh
he
will
never
release
me
wangel
to
you
you
say
she
belongs
to
you
the
stranger
has
she
told
you
anything
about
the
two
rings
my
ring
and
ellida
wangel
certainly
and
what
then
she
put
an
end
to
that
long
ago
you
have
had
her
letters
so
you
know
this
yourself
the
stranger
both
ellida
and
i
agreed
that
what
we
did
should
have
all
the
strength
and
authority
of
a
real
and
full
marriage
ellida
but
you
hear
i
will
not
never
on
earth
do
i
wish
to
know
anything
more
of
you
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
i
will
not
i
tell
you
wangel
you
must
be
mad
to
think
you
can
come
here
and
base
any
claim
upon
such
childish
nonsense
the
stranger
that
true
a
claim
in
your
sense
i
certainly
have
not
wangel
what
do
you
mean
to
do
then
you
surely
do
not
imagine
you
can
take
her
from
me
by
force
against
her
own
will
the
stranger
no
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
if
ellida
wishes
to
be
with
me
she
must
come
freely
ellida
starts
crying
out
freely
wangel
and
you
actually
believe
that
ellida
to
herself
freely
wangel
you
must
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
go
your
ways
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
the
stranger
looking
at
his
watch
it
is
almost
time
for
me
to
go
on
board
again
coming
nearer
yes
yes
ellida
now
i
have
done
my
duty
coming
still
nearer
i
have
kept
the
word
i
gave
you
ellida
beseechingly
drawing
away
oh
do
touch
me
the
stranger
and
so
now
you
must
think
it
over
till
tomorrow
night
wangel
there
is
nothing
to
think
over
here
see
that
you
get
away
the
stranger
still
to
ellida

with
the
steamer
up

will
come

and
then
i
shall
look
for
you
here
you
must
wait
for
me
here
in
the
garden
for
i
prefer
settling
the
matter
with
you
alone
you
understand
ellida
in
low
trembling
tone
do
you
hear
that
wangel
wangel
only
keep
calm
we
shall
know
how
to
prevent
this
visit
the
stranger
goodbye
for
the
present
ellida
so
tomorrow
night
ellida
imploringly
oh
no
no
do
not
come
tomorrow
night
never

here
again
the
stranger
and
should
you
then
have
a
mind
to
follow
me
over
the
seas
ellida
oh
do
look
at
me
like
that
the
stranger
i
only
mean
that
you
must
then
be
ready
to
set
out
wangel
go
up
to
the
house
ellida
ellida
i
can
not
oh
help
me
save
me
wangel
the
stranger
for

must
remember
that
if
you
do
not
go
with
me
tomorrow
all
is
at
an
end
ellida
looks
tremblingly
at
him
then
all
is
at
an
end
forever
the
stranger
nodding
nothing
can
change
it
then
ellida
i
shall
never
again
come
to
this
land
you
will
never
see
me
again
nor
hear
from
me
either
then
i
shall
be
as

forever
ellida
breathing
with
difficulty

carefully

shall
come
and

slowly
and
calmly
down
the
footpath
to
the
right
ellida
looking
after
him
for
a
time
freely
he
said

that

whole
thing

garden
and
thence
on
board
the
great
english
steamer

much
alive

for

distance

garden

her
hilde
nods
to
the
faithless

so
fascinating
ellida
looking
after
the
ship
tomorrow
then
wangel
and
then
never
again
ellida
in
a
low
imploring
tone
oh
wangel
save
me
from
myself
wangel
looks
anxiously
at
her
ellida
i
feel
there
is
something
behind
this
ellida
there
is
the
temptation
wangel
temptation
ellida
the
man
is
like
the
sea
she
goes
slowly
and
thoughtfully
through
the
garden
and
out
to
the
left
wangel
walks
uneasily
by
her
side
watching
her
closely
act
iv
doctor
wangel
doors
right
and
left
in
the
background
between
the
windows
an
open
glass
door
leading
out
on
to
the
verandah
below
this
a
portion
of
the
garden
is
visible
a
sofa
and
table
down
left
to
the
right
a
piano
and
farther
back
a
large
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
round
table
with
chairs
on
the
table
is
a
in
bloom
and
other
plants
around
it
morning
in
the
room
by
the
table
bolette
is
sitting
on
the
sofa
busy
with
some
embroidery
lyngstrand
is
seated
on
a
chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
in
the
garden
below
ballested
sits
painting
hilde
stands
by
watching
him
lyngstrand
with
his
arms
on
the
table
sits
silent
awhile
looking
at
bolette
work
it
must
be
awfully
difficult
to
do
a
border
like
that
miss
wangel
bolette
oh
no
it
not
very
difficult
if
only
you
take
care
to
count
right
lyngstrand
to
count
must
you
count
too
bolette
yes
the
stitches
see
lyngstrand
so
you
do
just
fancy
why
it
almost
a
kind
of
art
can
you
design
too
bolette
oh
yes
when
i
a
copy
lyngstrand
not
unless
bolette
no
lyngstrand
well
then
after
all
it
not
a
real
art
bolette
no
it
is
rather
only
a
sort
of
handicraft
lyngstrand
but
still
i
think
that
perhaps
you
could
learn
art
bolette
if
i
have
any
talent
lyngstrand
yes
if
you
could
always
be
with
a
real
true
artist
bolette
do
you
think
then
i
could
learn
it
from
him
lyngstrand
not
exactly
learn
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
i
think
it
would
grow
upon
you
little
by
little
by
a
kind
of
miracle
as
it
were
miss
wangel
bolette
that
would
be
wonderful
lyngstrand
after
a
pause
have
you
ever
thought
about
i
mean
have
you
ever
thought
deeply
and
earnestly
about
marriage
miss
wangel
bolette
looking
quickly
at
him
about
no
lyngstrand
i
have
bolette
really
have
you
lyngstrand
oh
yes
i
often
think
about
things
of
that
sort
especially
about
marriage
and
besides
i
read
several
books
about
it
i
think
marriage
must
be
counted
a
sort
of
miracle
that
a
woman
should
gradually
change
until
she
is
like
her
husband
bolette
you
mean
has
like
interests
lyngstrand
yes
that
it
bolette
well
but
his
abilities
his
talents
and
his
skill
lyngstrand
hm
well
i
should
like
to
know
if
all
that
too
bolette
then
perhaps
you
also
believe
that
everything
a
man
has
read
for
himself
and
thought
out
for
himself
that
this
too
can
grow
upon
his
wife
lyngstrand
yes
i
think
it
can
little
by
little
as
by
a
sort
of
miracle
but
of
course
i
know
such
things
can
only
happen
in
a
marriage
that
is
faithful
and
loving
and
really
happy
bolette
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
a
man
too
might
perhaps
be
thus
drawn
over
to
his
wife
grow
like
her
i
mean
lyngstrand
a
man
no
i
never
thought
of
that
bolette
but
why
not
one
as
well
as
the
other
lyngstrand
no
for
a
man
has
a
calling
that
he
lives
for
and
what
makes
a
man
so
strong
and
firm
miss
wangel
he
has
a
calling
in
life
bolette
has
every
man
lyngstrand
oh
no
i
am
thinking
more
especially
of
artists
bolette
do
you
think
it
right
of
an
artist
to
get
married
lyngstrand
yes
i
think
so
if
he
can
find
one
he
can
heartily
love
i
bolette
still
i
think
he
should
rather
live
for
his
art
alone
lyngstrand
of
course
he
must
but
he
can
do
that
just
as
well
even
if
he
marries
bolette
but
how
about
her
lyngstrand
her
who
bolette
she
whom
he
marries
what
is
she
to
live
for
lyngstrand
she
too
is
to
live
for
his
art
it
seems
to
me
a
woman
must
feel
so
thoroughly
happy
in
that
bolette
hm
i
do
exactly
know
lyngstrand
yes
miss
wangel
you
may
be
sure
of
that
it
is
not
merely
all
the
honour
and
respect
she
enjoys
through
him
for
that
seems
almost
the
least
important
to
me
but
it
is
this
that
she
can
help
him
to
create
that
she
can
lighten
his
work
for
him
be
about
him
and
see
to
his
comfort
and
tend
him
well
and
make
his
life
thoroughly
pleasant
i
should
think
that
must
be
perfectly
delightful
to
a
woman
bolette
ah
you
do
yourself
know
how
selfish
you
are
lyngstrand
i
selfish
good
heavens
oh
if
only
you
knew
me
a
little
better
than
you
do
bending
closer
to
her
miss
wangel
when
once
i
am
gone
and
that
will
be
very
soon
now
bolette
looks
pityingly
at
him
oh
do
think
of
anything
so
sad
lyngstrand
but
really
i
do
think
it
is
so
very
sad
bolette
what
do
you
mean
lyngstrand
well
you
know
that
i
set
out
in
a
month
first
from
here
and
then
of
course
i
going
south
bolette
oh
i
see
of
course
lyngstrand
will
you
think
of
me
sometimes
then
miss
wangel
bolette
yes
gladly
lyngstrand
pleased
no
promise
bolette
i
promise
lyngstrand
by
all
that
is
sacred
miss
bolette
bolette
by
all
that
is
sacred
in
a
changed
manner
oh
but
what
can
come
of
it
all
nothing
on
earth
can
come
of
it
lyngstrand
how
can
you
say
that
it
would
be
so
delightful
for
me
to
know
you
were
at
home
here
thinking
of
me
bolette
well
and
what
else
lyngstrand
i
do
exactly
know
of
anything
else
bolette
nor
i
either
there
are
so
many
things
in
the
way
everything
stands
in
the
way
i
think
lyngstrand
oh
another
miracle
might
come
about
some
happy
dispensation
of
fortune
or
something
of
the
sort
for
i
really
believe
i
shall
be
lucky
now
bolette
eagerly
really
you
do
believe
that
lyngstrand
yes
i
believe
it
thoroughly
and
so
after
a
few
years
when
i
come
home
again
as
a
celebrated
sculptor
and
well
off
and
in
perfect
health
bolette
yes
yes
of
course
we
will
hope
so
lyngstrand
you
may
be
perfectly
certain
about
it
only
think
faithfully
and
kindly
of
me
when
i
am
down
there
in
the
south
and
now
i
have
your
word
that
you
will
bolette
you
have
shaking
her
head
but
all
the
same
nothing
will
surely
come
of
it
lyngstrand
oh
yes
miss
bolette
at
least
this
will
come
of
it
i
shall
get
on
so
much
more
easily
and
quickly
with
my
art
work
bolette
do
you
believe
that
too
lyngstrand
i
have
an
inner
conviction
of
it
and
i
fancy
it
will
be
so
cheering
for
you
too
here
in
this
know
within
yourself
that
you
are
so
to
say
helping
me
to
create
bolette
looking
at
him
well
but
you
on
your
side
lyngstrand
i
bolette
looking
out
into
the
garden
hush
let
us
speak
of
something
else
here
arnholm
arnholm
is
seen
in
the
garden
below
he
stops
and
talks
to
hilde
and
ballested
lyngstrand
are
you
fond
of
your
old
teacher
miss
bolette
bolette
fond
of
him
lyngstrand
yes
i
mean
do
you
care
for
him
bolette
yes
indeed
i
do
for
he
is
a
true
friend
and
adviser
too
and
then
he
is
always
so
ready
to
help
when
he
can
lyngstrand
is
it
extraordinary
that
he
has
married
bolette
do
you
think
it
is
extraordinary
lyngstrand
yes
for
you
say
he
bolette
he
is
certainly
said
to
be
so
but
probably
it
was
so
easy
to
find
anyone
who
have
him
lyngstrand
why
bolette
oh
he
been
the
teacher
of
nearly
all
the
young
girls
that
he
knows
he
says
that
himself
lyngstrand
but
what
does
that
matter
bolette
why
good
heavens
one
does
marry
a
man
who
been
your
teacher
lyngstrand
do
you
think
a
young
girl
might
love
her
teacher
bolette
not
after
she
really
grown
up
lyngstrand
no
fancy
that
bolette
cautioning
him
sh
sh
meanwhile
ballested
has
been
gathering
together
his
things
and
carries
them
out
from
the
garden
to
the
right
hilde
helps
him
arnholm
goes
up
the
verandah
and
comes
into
the
room
arnholm
my
dear
bolette
hm
he
looks
displeased
and
nods
coldly
to
lyngstrand
who
rises
bolette
rising
up
and
going
up
to
arnholm
arnholm
arnholm
everything
all
right
here
today
bolette
yes
thanks
quite
arnholm
has
your
stepmother
gone
to
bathe
again
today
bolette
no
she
is
upstairs
in
her
room
arnholm
not
very
bright
bolette
i
do
know
for
she
has
locked
herself
in
arnholm
hm
has
she
lyngstrand
i
suppose
wangel
was
very
much
frightened
about
that
american
yesterday
arnholm
what
do
you
know
about
that
lyngstrand
i
told
wangel
that
i
had
seen
him
in
the
flesh
behind
the
garden
arnholm
oh
i
see
bolette
to
arnholm
no
doubt
you
and
father
sat
up
very
late
last
night
talking
arnholm
yes
rather
late
we
were
talking
over
serious
matters
bolette
did
you
put
in
a
word
for
me
and
my
affairs
too
arnholm
no
dear
bolette
i
could
manage
it
he
was
so
completely
taken
up
with
something
else
bolette
sighs
ah
yes
he
always
is
arnholm
looks
at
her
meaningly
but
later
on
today
we
talk
more
fully
about
the
matter
where
your
father
now
not
at
home
bolette
yes
he
is
he
must
be
down
in
the
office
i
fetch
him
arnholm
no
thanks
do
do
that
i
rather
go
down
to
him
bolette
listening
wait
one
moment
arnholm
i
believe
father
on
the
stairs
yes
i
suppose
he
been
up
to
look
after
her
wangel
comes
in
from
the
door
on
the
left
wangel
shaking
arnholm
hand
what
dear
friend
are
you
here
already
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
so
early
for
i
should
like
to
talk
a
little
further
with
you
bolette
to
lyngstrand
had
we
better
go
down
to
hilde
in
the
garden
lyngstrand
i
shall
be
delighted
miss
wangel
he
and
bolette
go
down
into
the
garden
and
pass
out
between
the
trees
in
the
background
arnholm
following
them
with
his
eyes
turns
to
wangel
do
you
know
anything
about
that
young
man
wangel
no
nothing
at
all
arnholm
but
do
you
think
it
right
he
should
knock
about
so
much
with
the
girls
wangel
does
he
i
really
had
noticed
it
arnholm
you
ought
to
see
to
it
i
think
wangel
yes
i
suppose
you
right
but
good
lord
what
a
man
to
do
the
girls
are
so
accustomed
to
look
after
themselves
now
they
listen
to
me
nor
to
ellida
arnholm
not
to
her
either
wangel
no
and
besides
i
really
can
not
expect
ellida
to
trouble
about
such
things
she
not
fit
for
that
breaking
off
but
it
was
that
which
we
were
to
talk
of
now
tell
me
have
you
thought
the
matter
over
thought
over
all
i
told
you
of
arnholm
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
ever
since
we
parted
last
night
wangel
and
what
do
you
think
should
be
done
arnholm
dear
wangel
i
think
you
as
a
doctor
must
know
that
better
than
wangel
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
doctor
to
judge
rightly
about
a
patient
who
is
so
dear
to
him
besides
this
is
no
ordinary
illness
no
ordinary
doctor
and
no
ordinary
medicines
can
help
her
arnholm
how
is
she
today
wangel
i
was
upstairs
with
her
just
now
and
then
she
seemed
to
me
quite
calm
but
behind
all
her
moods
something
lies
hidden
which
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
fathom
and
then
she
is
so
changeable
so
capricious
she
varies
so
suddenly
arnholm
no
doubt
that
is
the
result
of
her
morbid
state
of
mind
wangel
not
altogether
when
you
go
down
to
the
bedrock
it
was
born
in
her
ellida
belongs
to
the
that
is
the
matter
arnholm
what
do
you
really
mean
my
dear
doctor
wangel
have
you
noticed
that
the
people
from
out
there
by
the
open
sea
are
in
a
way
a
people
apart
it
is
almost
as
if
they
themselves
lived
the
life
of
the
sea
there
is
the
rush
of
waves
and
ebb
and
flow
too
both
in
their
thoughts
and
in
their
feelings
and
so
they
can
never
bear
transplanting
oh
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
it
was
a
sin
against
ellida
to
take
her
away
from
there
and
bring
her
here
arnholm
you
have
come
to
that
opinion
wangel
yes
more
and
more
but
i
ought
to
have
told
myself
this
beforehand
oh
i
knew
it
well
enough
at
bottom
but
i
put
it
from
me
for
you
see
i
loved
her
so
therefore
i
thought
of
myself
first
of
all
i
was
inexcusably
selfish
at
that
time
arnholm
hm
i
suppose
every
man
is
a
little
selfish
under
such
circumstances
moreover
i
never
noticed
that
vice
in
you
doctor
wangel
wangel
walks
uneasily
about
the
room
oh
yes
and
i
have
been
since
then
too
why
i
am
so
much
much
older
than
she
is
i
ought
to
have
been
at
once
as
a
father
to
her
and
a
guide
i
ought
to
have
done
my
best
to
develop
and
enlighten
her
mind
unfortunately
nothing
ever
came
of
that
you
see
i
had
stamina
enough
for
i
preferred
her
just
as
she
was
so
things
went
worse
and
worse
with
her
and
then
i
know
what
to
do
in
a
lower
voice
that
was
why
i
wrote
to
you
in
my
trouble
and
asked
you
to
come
here
arnholm
looks
at
him
in
astonishment
what
was
it
for
this
you
wrote
wangel
yes
but
do
let
anyone
notice
anything
arnholm
how
on
earth
dear
doctor
what
good
did
you
expect
me
to
be
i
do
understand
it
wangel
no
naturally
for
i
was
on
an
altogether
false
track
i
thought
ellida
heart
had
at
one
time
gone
out
to
you
and
that
she
still
secretly
cared
for
you
a
little
that
perhaps
it
would
do
her
good
to
see
you
again
and
talk
of
her
home
and
the
old
days
arnholm
so
it
was
your
wife
you
meant
when
you
wrote
that
she
expected
me
and
and
perhaps
longed
for
me
wangel
yes
who
else
arnholm
hurriedly
no
no
you
right
but
i
did
understand
wangel
naturally
as
i
said
for
i
was
on
an
absolutely
wrong
track
arnholm
and
you
call
yourself
selfish
wangel
ah
but
i
had
such
a
great
sin
to
atone
for
i
felt
i
dared
not
neglect
any
means
that
might
give
the
slightest
relief
to
her
mind
arnholm
how
do
you
really
explain
the
power
this
stranger
exercises
over
her
wangel
hm
dear
friend
there
may
be
sides
to
the
matter
that
can
not
be
explained
arnholm
do
you
mean
anything
inexplicable
in
itself
absolutely
inexplicable
wangel
in
any
case
not
explicable
as
far
as
we
know
arnholm
do
you
believe
there
is
something
in
it
then
wangel
i
neither
believe
nor
deny
i
simply
do
know
that
why
i
leave
it
alone
arnholm
yes
but
just
one
thing
her
extraordinary
weird
assertion
about
the
child
eyes
wangel
eagerly
i
do
believe
a
word
about
the
eyes
i
will
not
believe
such
a
thing
it
must
be
purely
fancy
on
her
part
nothing
else
arnholm
did
you
notice
the
man
eyes
when
you
saw
him
yesterday
wangel
of
course
i
did
arnholm
and
you
saw
no
sort
of
resemblance
wangel
evasively
hm
good
heavens
what
shall
i
say
it
was
quite
light
when
i
saw
him
and
besides
ellida
had
been
saying
so
much
about
this
resemblance
i
really
do
know
if
i
was
capable
of
observing
quite
impartially
arnholm
well
well
may
be
but
that
other
matter
all
this
terror
and
unrest
coming
upon
her
at
the
very
time
as
it
seems
this
strange
man
was
on
his
way
home
wangel
that
oh
that
something
she
must
have
persuaded
and
dreamed
herself
into
since
it
happened
she
was
not
seized
with
this
so
suddenly
all
at
once
as
she
now
maintains
but
since
she
heard
from
young
lyngstrand
that
johnston
or
friman
or
whatever
his
name
is
was
on
his
way
hither
three
years
ago
in
the
month
of
march
she
now
evidently
believes
her
unrest
of
mind
came
upon
her
at
that
very
time
arnholm
it
was
not
so
then
wangel
by
no
means
there
were
signs
and
symptoms
of
it
before
this
time
though
it
did
happen
by
chance
that
in
that
month
of
march
three
years
ago
she
had
a
rather
severe
attack
arnholm
after
all
then
wangel
yes
but
that
is
easily
accounted
for
by
the
circumstances
the
condition
she
happened
to
be
in
at
the
time
arnholm
so
symptom
for
symptom
then
wangel
wringing
his
hands
and
not
to
be
able
to
help
her
not
to
know
how
to
counsel
her
to
see
no
way
arnholm
now
if
you
could
make
up
your
mind
to
leave
this
place
to
go
somewhere
else
so
that
she
could
live
amid
surroundings
that
would
seem
more
homelike
to
her
wangel
ah
dear
friend
do
you
think
i
have
offered
her
that
too
i
suggested
moving
out
to
skjoldviken
but
she
will
not
arnholm
not
that
either
wangel
no
for
she
does
think
it
would
be
any
good
and
perhaps
she
right
arnholm
hm
do
you
say
that
wangel
moreover
when
i
think
it
all
over
carefully
i
really
know
how
i
could
manage
it
i
do
think
i
should
be
justified
for
the
sake
of
the
girls
in
going
away
to
such
a
desolate
place
after
all
they
must
live
where
there
is
at
least
a
prospect
of
their
being
provided
for
someday
arnholm
provided
for
are
you
thinking
about
that
already
wangel
heaven
knows
i
must
think
of
that
too
but
then
on
the
other
hand
again
my
poor
sick
ellida
oh
dear
arnholm
in
many
respects
i
seem
to
be
standing
between
fire
and
water
arnholm
perhaps
you
no
need
to
worry
on
bolette
account
breaking
off
i
should
like
to
know
where
she
where
they
have
gone
goes
up
to
the
open
door
and
looks
out
wangel
oh
i
would
so
gladly
make
any
sacrifice
for
all
three
of
them
if
only
i
knew
what
ellida
enters
from
the
door
on
the
left
ellida
quickly
to
wangel
be
sure
you
do
go
out
this
morning
wangel
no
no
of
course
not
i
will
stay
at
home
with
you
pointing
to
arnholm
who
is
coming
towards
them
but
wo
you
speak
to
our
friend
ellida
turning
oh
are
you
here
arnholm
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
arnholm
wangel
so
you
not
been
bathing
as
usual
today
ellida
no
no
no
that
is
out
of
the
question
today
but
wo
you
sit
down
a
moment
arnholm
no
thanks
not
now
looks
at
wangel
i
promised
the
girls
to
go
down
to
them
in
the
garden
ellida
goodness
knows
if
you
find
them
there
i
never
know
where
they
may
be
rambling
wangel
they
sure
to
be
down
by
the
pond
arnholm
oh
i
shall
find
them
right
enough
nods
and
goes
out
across
the
verandah
into
the
garden
ellida
what
time
is
it
wangel
wangel
looking
at
his
watch
a
little
past
eleven
ellida
a
little
past
and
at
eleven
or
eleven
tonight
the
steamer
is
coming
if
only
that
were
over
wangel
going
nearer
to
her
dear
ellida
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
ask
you
ellida
what
is
it
wangel
the
evening
before
last
up
at
the
view
you
said
that
during
the
last
three
years
you
had
so
often
seen
him
bodily
before
you
ellida
and
so
i
have
you
may
believe
that
wangel
but
how
did
you
see
him
ellida
how
did
i
see
him
wangel
i
mean
how
did
he
look
when
you
thought
you
saw
him
ellida
but
dear
wangel
why
you
now
know
yourself
how
he
looks
wangel
did
he
look
exactly
like
that
in
your
imagination
ellida
he
did
wangel
exactly
the
same
as
you
saw
him
in
reality
yesterday
evening
ellida
yes
exactly
wangel
then
how
was
it
you
did
not
at
once
recognise
him
ellida
did
i
not
wangel
no
you
said
yourself
afterwards
that
at
first
you
did
not
at
all
know
who
the
strange
man
was
ellida
perplexed
i
really
believe
you
are
right
do
you
think
that
strange
wangel
fancy
my
not
knowing
him
at
once
wangel
it
was
only
the
eyes
you
said
ellida
oh
yes
the
eyes
the
eyes
wangel
well
but
at
the
view
you
said
that
he
always
appeared
to
you
exactly
as
he
was
when
you
parted
out
there
ten
years
ago
ellida
did
i
wangel
yes
ellida
then
i
suppose
he
did
look
much
as
he
does
now
wangel
no
on
our
way
home
the
day
before
yesterday
you
gave
quite
another
description
of
him
ten
years
ago
he
had
no
beard
you
said
his
dress
too
was
quite
different
and
that
with
the
pearl
that
man
yesterday
wore
nothing
of
the
sort
ellida
no
he
did
not
wangel
looks
searchingly
at
her
now
just
think
a
little
dear
ellida
or
perhaps
you
ca
quite
remember
how
he
looked
when
he
stood
by
you
at
bratthammer
ellida
thoughtfully
closing
her
eyes
for
a
moment
not
quite
distinctly
no
today
i
ca
is
it
not
strange
wangel
not
so
very
strange
after
all
you
have
now
been
confronted
by
a
new
and
real
image
and
that
overshadows
the
old
one
so
that
you
can
no
longer
see
it
ellida
do
you
believe
that
wangel
wangel
yes
and
it
overshadows
your
sick
imaginings
too
that
is
why
it
is
good
a
reality
has
come
ellida
good
do
you
think
it
good
wangel
yes
that
it
has
come
it
may
restore
you
to
health
ellida
sitting
down
on
sofa
wangel
come
and
sit
down
by
me
i
must
tell
you
all
my
thoughts
wangel
yes
do
dear
ellida
he
sits
down
on
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
ellida
it
was
really
a
great
misfortune
for
us
both
that
we
two
of
all
people
should
have
come
together
wangel
amazed
what
are
you
saying
ellida
oh
yes
it
was
and
it
so
natural
it
could
bring
nothing
but
unhappiness
after
the
way
in
which
we
came
together
wangel
what
was
there
in
that
way
ellida
listen
wangel
it
no
use
going
on
lying
to
ourselves
and
to
one
another
wangel
are
we
doing
so
lying
you
say
ellida
yes
we
are
or
at
least
we
suppress
the
truth
for
the
truth
the
pure
and
simple
truth
is
that
you
came
out
there
and
bought
me
wangel
bought
you
say
bought
ellida
oh
i
was
a
bit
better
than
you
i
accepted
the
bargain
sold
myself
to
you
wangel
looks
at
her
full
of
pain
ellida
have
you
really
the
heart
to
call
it
that
ellida
but
is
there
any
other
name
for
it
you
could
no
longer
bear
the
emptiness
of
your
house
you
were
on
the
for
a
new
wife
wangel
and
a
new
mother
for
the
children
ellida
ellida
that
too
perhaps
by
the
way
although
you
did
in
the
least
know
if
i
were
fit
for
the
position
why
you
had
only
seen
me
and
spoken
to
me
a
few
times
then
you
wanted
me
and
so
wangel
yes
you
may
call
it
as
you
will
ellida
and
i
on
my
side
why
i
was
so
helpless
and
bewildered
and
so
absolutely
alone
oh
it
was
so
natural
i
should
accept
the
bargain
when
you
came
and
proposed
to
provide
for
me
all
my
life
wangel
assuredly
it
did
not
seem
to
me
a
providing
for
you
dear
ellida
i
asked
you
honestly
if
you
would
share
with
me
and
the
children
the
little
i
could
call
my
own
ellida
yes
you
did
but
all
the
same
i
should
never
have
accepted
never
have
accepted
that
at
any
price
not
sold
myself
better
the
meanest
work
better
the
poorest
life
after
one
own
choice
wangel
rising
then
have
the
five
six
years
that
we
have
lived
together
been
so
utterly
worthless
to
you
ellida
oh
do
think
that
wangel
i
have
been
as
well
cared
for
here
as
human
being
could
desire
but
i
did
not
enter
your
house
freely
that
is
the
thing
wangel
looking
at
her
not
freely
ellida
no
it
was
not
freely
that
i
went
with
you
wangel
in
subdued
tone
ah
i
remember
your
words
of
yesterday
ellida
it
all
lies
in
those
words
they
have
enlightened
me
and
so
i
see
it
all
now
wangel
what
do
you
see
ellida
i
see
that
the
life
we
two
live
together
is
really
no
marriage
wangel
bitterly
you
have
spoken
truly
there
the
life
we
now
live
is
not
a
marriage
ellida
nor
was
it
formerly
never
not
from
the
very
first
looks
straight
in
front
of
her
the
first
that
might
have
been
a
complete
and
real
marriage
wangel
the
first
what
do
you
mean
ellida
mine
with
him
wangel
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
i
do
not
in
the
least
understand
you
ellida
ah
dear
wangel
let
us
not
lie
to
one
another
nor
to
ourselves
wangel
well
what
more
ellida
you
see
we
can
never
get
away
from
that
one
thing
that
a
freely
given
promise
is
fully
as
binding
as
a
marriage
wangel
but
what
on
earth
ellida
rising
impetuously
set
me
free
wangel
wangel
ellida
ellida
ellida
yes
yes
oh
grant
me
that
believe
me
it
will
come
to
that
all
the
same
after
the
way
we
two
came
together
wangel
conquering
his
pain
it
has
come
to
this
then
ellida
it
has
come
to
this
it
could
not
be
otherwise
wangel
looking
gloomily
at
her
so
i
have
not
won
you
by
our
living
together
never
never
possessed
you
quite
ellida
ah
wangel
if
only
i
could
love
you
how
gladly
i
would
as
dearly
as
you
deserve
but
i
feel
it
so
well
that
will
never
be
wangel
divorce
then
it
is
a
divorce
a
complete
legal
divorce
that
you
want
ellida
dear
you
understand
me
so
little
i
care
nothing
for
such
formalities
such
outer
things
matter
nothing
i
think
what
i
want
is
that
we
should
of
our
own
free
will
release
each
other
wangel
bitterly
nods
slowly
to
cry
off
the
bargain
again
yes
ellida
quickly
exactly
to
cry
off
the
bargain
wangel
and
then
ellida
afterwards
have
you
reflected
what
life
would
be
to
both
of
us
what
life
would
be
to
both
you
and
me
ellida
no
matter
things
must
turn
out
afterwards
as
they
may
what
i
beg
and
implore
of
you
wangel
is
the
most
important
only
set
me
free
give
me
back
my
complete
freedom
wangel
ellida
it
is
a
fearful
thing
you
ask
of
me
at
least
give
me
time
to
collect
myself
before
i
come
to
a
decision
let
us
talk
it
over
more
carefully
and
you
yourself
take
time
to
consider
what
you
are
doing
ellida
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
with
such
matters
i
must
have
my
freedom
again
today
wangel
why
today
ellida
because
he
is
coming
tonight
wangel
starts
coming
he
what
has
this
stranger
to
do
with
it
ellida
i
want
to
face
him
in
perfect
freedom
wangel
and
what
what
else
do
you
intend
to
do
ellida
i
will
not
hide
behind
the
fact
that
i
am
the
wife
of
another
man
nor
make
the
excuse
that
i
have
no
choice
for
then
it
would
be
no
decision
wangel
you
speak
of
a
choice
choice
ellida
a
choice
in
such
a
matter
ellida
yes
i
must
be
free
to
choose
to
choose
for
either
side
i
must
be
able
to
let
him
go
away
alone
or
to
go
with
him
wangel
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
go
with
him
give
your
whole
life
into
his
hands
ellida
did
i
give
my
life
into
your
hands
and
without
any
ado
wangel
maybe
but
he
he
an
absolute
stranger
a
man
of
whom
you
know
so
little
ellida
ah
but
after
all
i
knew
you
even
less
and
yet
i
went
with
you
wangel
then
you
knew
to
some
extent
what
life
lay
before
you
but
now
think
what
do
you
know
you
know
absolutely
nothing
not
even
who
or
what
he
is
ellida
looking
in
front
of
her
that
is
true
but
that
is
the
terror
wangel
yes
indeed
it
is
terrible
ellida
that
is
why
i
feel
i
must
plunge
into
it
wangel
looking
at
her
because
it
seems
terrible
ellida
yes
because
of
that
wangel
coming
closer
listen
ellida
what
do
you
really
mean
by
terrible
ellida
reflectively
the
terrible
is
that
which
repels
and
attracts
wangel
attracts
you
say
ellida
attracts
most
of
all
i
think
wangel
slowly
you
are
one
with
the
sea
ellida
that
too
is
a
terror
wangel
and
that
terror
is
in
you
you
both
repel
and
attract
ellida
do
you
think
so
wangel
wangel
after
all
i
have
never
really
known
you
never
really
now
i
am
beginning
to
understand
ellida
and
that
is
why
you
must
set
me
free
free
me
from
every
bond
to
you
and
yours
i
am
not
what
you
took
me
for
now
you
see
it
yourself
now
we
can
part
as
friends
and
freely
wangel
sadly
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
us
both
if
we
parted
and
yet
i
can
not
you
are
the
terror
to
me
ellida
the
attraction
is
what
is
strongest
in
you
ellida
do
you
say
that
wangel
let
us
try
and
live
through
this
day
wisely
in
perfect
quiet
of
mind
i
dare
not
set
you
free
and
release
you
today
i
have
no
right
to
no
right
for
your
own
sake
ellida
i
exercise
my
right
and
my
duty
to
protect
you
ellida
protect
what
is
there
to
protect
me
from
i
am
not
threatened
by
any
outward
power
the
terror
lies
deeper
wangel
the
terror
is
the
attraction
in
my
own
mind
and
what
can
you
do
against
that
wangel
i
can
strengthen
and
urge
you
to
fight
against
it
ellida
yes
if
i
wished
to
fight
against
it
wangel
then
you
do
not
wish
to
ellida
oh
i
do
know
myself
wangel
tonight
all
will
be
decided
dear
ellida
ellida
bursting
out
yes
think
the
decision
so
near
the
decision
for
one
whole
life
wangel
and
then
tomorrow
ellida
tomorrow
perhaps
my
real
future
will
have
been
ruined
wangel
your
real
ellida
the
whole
full
life
of
freedom
lost
lost
for
me
and
perhaps
for
him
also
wangel
in
a
lower
tone
seizing
her
wrist
ellida
do
you
love
this
stranger
ellida
do
i
oh
how
can
i
tell
i
only
know
that
to
me
he
is
a
terror
and
that
wangel
and
that
ellida
tearing
herself
away
and
that
it
is
to
him
i
think
i
belong
wangel
bowing
his
head
i
begin
to
understand
better
ellida
and
what
remedy
have
you
for
that
what
advice
to
give
me
wangel
looking
sadly
at
her
tomorrow
he
will
be
gone
then
the
misfortune
will
be
averted
from
your
head
and
then
i
will
consent
to
set
you
free
we
will
cry
off
the
bargain
tomorrow
ellida
ellida
ah
wangel
tomorrow

is
too
late

by
contending
thoughts
and
emotions
wangel
and
arnholm

across

outside
the
fence
hallo
doctor
wangel
wangel
noticing
him
oh
is
it
you
is
there
to
be
music
tonight
ballested
yes
the
wind
band
society
thought
of
making
themselves
heard
we
no
dearth
of
festive
occasions
nowadays
tonight
it
in
honour
of
the
english
ship
ellida
the
english
ship
is
she
in
sight
already
ballested
not
yet
but
you
know
she
comes
from
between
the
islands
you
ca
see
anything
of
her
and
then
she
alongside
of
you
ellida
yes
that
is
so
wangel
half
to
ellida
tonight
is
the
last
voyage
then
she
will
not
come
again
ballested
a
sad
thought
doctor
and
that
why
we
going
to
give
them
an
ovation
as
the
saying
is
ah
yes
ah
yes
the
glad
summertime
will
soon
be
over
now
soon
all
ways
will
be
barred
as
they
say
in
the
tragedy
ellida
all
ways
barred
yes
ballested
it
sad
to
think
of
we
have
been
the
joyous
children
of
summer
for
weeks
and
months
now
it
hard
to
reconcile
yourself
to
the
dark
days
just
at
first
i
mean
for
men
can
accli
a
acclimatise
themselves
wangel
ay
indeed
they
can
bows
and
goes
off
to
the
left
ellida
looking
out
at
the
fjord
oh
this
terrible
suspense
this
torturing
last
before
the
decision
wangel
you
are
determined
then
to
speak
to
him
yourself
ellida
i
must
speak
to
him
myself
for
it
is
freely
that
i
must
make
my
choice
wangel
you
have
no
choice
ellida
you
have
no
right
to
choose
no
right
without
my
permission
ellida
you
can
never
prevent
the
choice
neither
you
nor
anyone
you
can
forbid
me
to
go
away
with
him
to
follow
him
in
case
i
should
choose
to
do
that
you
can
keep
me
here
by
force
against
my
will
that
you
can
do
but
that
i
should
choose
choose
from
my
very
soul
choose
him
and
not
you
in
case
i
would
and
did
choose
thus
this
you
can
not
prevent
wangel
no
you
are
right
i
can
not
prevent
that
ellida
and
so
i
have
nothing
to
help
me
to
resist
here
at
home
there
is
no
single
thing
that
attracts
me
and
binds
me
i
am
so
absolutely
rootless
in
your
house
wangel
the
children
are
not
mine
their
hearts
i
mean
never
have
been
when
i
go
if
i
do
go
either
with
him
tonight
or
to
skjoldviken
tomorrow
i
have
a
key
to
give
up
an
order
to
give
about
anything
whatsoever
i
am
absolutely
rootless
in
your
house
i
have
been
absolutely
outside
everything
from
the
very
first
wangel
you
yourself
wished
it
ellida
no
no
i
did
not
i
neither
wished
nor
did
not
wish
it
i
simply
left
things
just
as
i
found
them
the
day
i
came
here
it
is
you
and
no
one
else
who
wished
it
wangel
i
thought
to
do
all
for
the
best
for
you
ellida
yes
wangel
i
know
it
so
well
but
there
is
retribution
in
that
a
something
that
avenges
itself
for
now
i
find
no
binding
power
to
strengthen
me
nothing
to
help
me
nothing
to
draw
me
towards
what
should
have
been
the
strongest
possession
of
us
both
wangel
i
see
it
ellida
and
that
is
why
from
you
shall
have
back
your
freedom
henceforth
you
shall
live
your
own
life
ellida
and
you
call
that
my
own
life
no
my
own
true
life
lost
its
bearings
when
i
agreed
to
live
with
you
clenches
her
hand
in
fear
and
unrest
and
now
tonight
in
half
an
hour
he
whom
i
forsook
is
coming
he
to
whom
i
should
have
cleaved
forever
even
as
he
has
cleaved
to
me
now
he
is
coming
to
offer
me
for
the
last
and
only
time
the
chance
of
living
my
life
over
again
of
living
my
own
true
life
the
life
that
terrifies
and
attracts
and
i
can
not
forgo
that
not
freely
wangel
that
is
why
it
is
necessary
your
husband
and
your
doctor
should
take
the
power
of
acting
from
you
and
act
on
your
behalf
ellida
yes
wangel
i
quite
understand
believe
me
there
are
times
when
i
think
it
would
be
peace
and
deliverance
if
with
all
my
soul
i
could
be
bound
to
you
and
try
to
brave
all
that
terrifies
and
attracts
but
i
can
not
no
no
i
can
not
do
that
wangel
come
ellida
let
us
walk
up
and
down
together
for
awhile
ellida
i
would
gladly
but
i
dare
not
for
he
said
i
was
to
wait
for
him
here
wangel
come
there
is
time
enough
ellida
do
you
think
so
wangel
plenty
of
time
i
tell
you
ellida
then
let
us
go
for
a
little
while
they
pass
out
in
the
foreground
at
the
same
time
arnholm
and
bolette
appear
by
the
upper
bank
of
the
pond
bolette
noticing
the
two
as
they
go
out
see
there
arnholm
in
low
voice
hush
let
them
go
bolette
can
you
understand
what
has
been
going
on
between
them
these
last
few
days
arnholm
have
you
noticed
anything
bolette
have
i
not
arnholm
anything
peculiar
bolette
yes
one
thing
and
another
have
you
arnholm
well
i
do
exactly
know
bolette
yes
you
have
only
you
wo
speak
out
about
it
arnholm
i
think
it
will
do
your
stepmother
good
to
go
on
this
little
journey
bolette
do
you
think
so
arnholm
i
should
say
it
would
be
well
for
all
parties
that
she
should
get
away
every
now
and
then
bolette
if
she
does
go
home
to
skjoldviken
tomorrow
she
will
never
come
back
here
again
arnholm
my
dear
bolette
whatever
makes
you
think
that
bolette
i
am
quite
convinced
of
it
just
you
wait
you
see
that
she
not
come
back
again
not
anyhow
as
long
as
i
and
hilde
are
in
the
house
here
arnholm
hilde
too
bolette
well
it
might
perhaps
be
all
right
with
hilde
for
she
is
scarcely
more
than
a
child
and
i
believe
that
at
bottom
she
worships
ellida
but
you
see
it
different
with
me
a
stepmother
who
is
so
very
much
older
than
oneself
arnholm
dear
bolette
perhaps
it
might
after
all
not
be
so
very
long
before
you
left
bolette
eagerly
really
have
you
spoken
to
father
about
it
arnholm
yes
i
have
bolette
well
what
does
he
say
arnholm
hm
well
your
father
so
thoroughly
taken
up
with
other
matters
just
now
bolette
yes
yes
that
how
i
knew
it
would
be
arnholm
but
i
got
this
much
out
of
him
you
must
reckon
upon
any
help
from
him
bolette
no
arnholm
he
explained
his
circumstances
to
me
clearly
he
thought
that
such
a
thing
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
impossible
for
him
bolette
reproachfully
and
you
had
the
heart
to
come
and
mock
me
arnholm
i
certainly
not
done
that
dear
bolette
it
depends
wholly
and
solely
upon
yourself
whether
you
go
away
or
not
bolette
what
depends
upon
me
arnholm
whether
you
are
to
go
out
into
the
world
learn
all
you
most
care
for
take
part
in
all
you
are
hungering
after
here
at
home
live
your
life
under
brighter
conditions
bolette
bolette
clasping
her
hands
together
good
god
but
it
impossible
if
father
neither
can
nor
will
and
i
have
no
one
else
on
earth
to
whom
i
could
turn
arnholm
could
you
make
up
your
mind
to
accept
a
little
help
from
your
old
from
your
former
teacher
bolette
from
you
arnholm
would
you
be
willing
to
arnholm
stand
by
you
yes
with
all
my
heart
both
with
word
and
in
deed
you
may
count
upon
it
then
you
accept
well
do
you
agree
bolette
do
i
agree
to
get
away
to
see
the
world
to
learn
something
thoroughly
all
that
seemed
to
be
a
great
beautiful
impossibility
arnholm
all
that
may
now
become
a
reality
to
you
if
only
you
yourself
wish
it
bolette
and
to
all
this
unspeakable
happiness
you
will
help
me
oh
no
tell
me
can
i
accept
such
an
offer
from
a
stranger
arnholm
you
can
from
me
bolette
from
me
you
can
accept
anything
bolette
seizing
his
hands
yes
i
almost
think
i
can
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
bursting
out
oh
i
could
both
laugh
and
cry
for
joy
for
happiness
then
i
should
know
life
really
after
all
i
began
to
be
so
afraid
life
would
pass
me
by
arnholm
you
need
not
fear
that
bolette
but
now
you
must
tell
me
quite
frankly
if
there
is
anything
anything
you
are
bound
to
here
bolette
bound
to
nothing
arnholm
nothing
whatever
bolette
no
nothing
at
all
that
is
i
am
bound
to
father
to
some
extent
and
to
hilde
too
but
arnholm
well
you
have
to
leave
your
father
sooner
or
later
and
some
time
hilde
also
will
go
her
own
way
in
life
that
is
only
a
question
of
time
nothing
more
and
so
there
is
nothing
else
that
binds
you
bolette
not
any
kind
of
connection
bolette
nothing
whatever
as
far
as
that
goes
i
could
leave
at
any
moment
arnholm
well
if
that
is
so
dear
bolette
you
shall
go
away
with
me
bolette
clapping
her
hands
oh
god
what
joy
to
think
of
it
arnholm
for
i
hope
you
trust
me
fully
bolette
indeed
i
do
arnholm
and
you
dare
to
trust
yourself
and
your
future
fully
and
confidently
into
my
hands
bolette
is
that
true
you
will
dare
to
do
this
bolette
of
course
how
could
i
not
do
so
could
you
believe
anything
else
you
who
have
been
my
old
teacher
my
teacher
in
the
old
days
i
mean
arnholm
not
because
of
that
i
will
not
consider
that
side
of
the
matter
but
well
so
you
are
free
bolette
there
is
nothing
that
binds
you
and
so
i
ask
you
if
you
could
if
you
could
bind
yourself
to
me
for
life
bolette
steps
back
frightened
what
are
you
saying
arnholm
for
all
your
life
bolette
will
you
be
my
wife
bolette
half
to
herself
no
no
no
that
is
impossible
utterly
impossible
arnholm
it
is
really
so
absolutely
impossible
for
you
to
bolette
but
surely
you
can
not
mean
what
you
are
saying
arnholm
looking
at
him
or
yet
was
that
what
you
meant
when
you
offered
to
do
so
much
for
me
arnholm
you
must
listen
to
me
one
moment
bolette
i
suppose
i
have
greatly
surprised
you
bolette
oh
how
could
such
a
thing
from
you
how
could
it
but
but
surprise
me
arnholm
perhaps
you
are
right
of
course
you
did
you
could
not
know
it
was
for
your
sake
i
made
this
journey
bolette
did
you
come
here
for
for
my
sake
arnholm
i
did
bolette
in
the
spring
i
received
a
letter
from
your
father
and
in
it
there
was
a
passage
that
made
me
think
hm
that
you
held
your
former
teacher
in
in
a
little
more
than
friendly
remembrance
bolette
how
could
father
write
such
a
thing
arnholm
he
did
not
mean
it
so
but
i
worked
myself
into
the
belief
that
here
was
a
young
girl
longing
for
me
to
come
again
no
you
interrupt
me
dear
bolette
and
you
see
when
a
man
like
myself
who
is
no
longer
quite
young
has
such
a
belief
or
fancy
it
makes
an
overwhelming
impression
there
grew
within
me
a
living
a
grateful
affection
for
you
i
thought
i
must
come
to
you
see
you
again
and
tell
you
i
shared
the
feelings
that
i
fancied
you
had
for
me
bolette
and
now
you
know
it
is
not
so
that
it
was
a
mistake
arnholm
it
ca
be
helped
bolette
your
image
as
i
bear
it
within
myself
will
always
be
coloured
and
stamped
with
the
impression
that
this
mistake
gave
me
perhaps
you
can
not
understand
this
but
still
it
is
so
bolette
i
never
thought
such
a
thing
possible
arnholm
but
now
you
have
seen
that
it
is
possible
what
do
you
say
now
bolette
could
you
make
up
your
mind
to
be
yes
to
be
my
wife
bolette
oh
it
seems
so
utterly
impossible
arnholm
you
who
have
been
my
teacher
i
ca
imagine
ever
standing
in
any
other
relation
towards
you
arnholm
well
well
if
you
think
you
really
can
not
then
our
old
relations
remain
unchanged
dear
bolette
bolette
what
do
you
mean
arnholm
of
course
to
keep
my
promise
all
the
same
i
will
take
care
you
get
out
into
the
world
and
see
something
of
it
learn
some
things
you
really
want
to
know
live
safe
and
independent
your
future
i
shall
provide
for
also
bolette
for
in
me
you
will
always
have
a
good
faithful
trustworthy
friend
be
sure
of
that
bolette
good
heavens
arnholm
all
that
is
so
utterly
impossible
now
arnholm
is
that
impossible
too
bolette
surely
you
can
see
that
after
what
you
have
just
said
to
me
and
after
my
answer
oh
you
yourself
must
see
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
now
to
accept
so
very
much
from
you
i
can
accept
nothing
from
you
nothing
after
this
arnholm
so
you
would
rather
stay
at
home
here
and
let
life
pass
you
by
bolette
oh
it
is
such
dreadful
misery
to
think
of
that
arnholm
will
you
renounce
knowing
something
of
the
outer
world
renounce
bearing
your
part
in
all
that
you
yourself
say
you
are
hungering
for
to
know
there
is
so
infinitely
much
and
yet
never
really
to
understand
anything
of
it
think
carefully
bolette
bolette
yes
yes
you
are
right
arnholm
arnholm
and
then
when
one
day
your
father
is
no
longer
here
then
perhaps
to
be
left
helpless
and
alone
in
the
world
or
live
to
give
yourself
to
another
man
whom
you
perhaps
will
also
feel
no
affection
for
bolette
oh
yes
i
see
how
true
all
you
say
is
but
still
and
yet
perhaps
arnholm
quickly
well
bolette
looking
at
him
hesitatingly
perhaps
it
might
not
be
so
impossible
after
all
arnholm
what
bolette
bolette
perhaps
it
might
be
possible
to
accept
what
you
proposed
to
me
arnholm
do
you
mean
that
after
all
you
might
be
willing
to
that
at
all
events
you
could
give
me
the
happiness
of
helping
you
as
a
steadfast
friend
bolette
no
no
no
never
that
for
that
would
be
utterly
impossible
now
no
arnholm
rather
take
me
arnholm
bolette
you
will
bolette
yes
i
believe
i
will
arnholm
and
after
all
you
will
be
my
wife
bolette
yes
if
you
still
think
that
that
you
will
have
me
arnholm
think
seizing
her
hand
oh
thanks
thanks
bolette
all
else
that
you
said
your
former
doubts
these
do
not
frighten
me
if
i
do
not
yet
possess
your
whole
heart
i
shall
know
how
to
conquer
it
oh
bolette
i
will
wait
upon
you
hand
and
foot
bolette
and
then
i
shall
see
something
of
the
world
shall
live
you
have
promised
me
that
arnholm
and
will
keep
my
promise
bolette
and
i
may
learn
everything
i
want
to
arnholm
i
myself
will
be
your
teacher
as
formerly
bolette
do
you
remember
the
last
school
year
bolette
quietly
and
absently
to
think
to
know
one
self
free
and
to
get
out
into
the
strange
world
and
then
not
to
need
to
be
anxious
for
the
future
not
to
be
harassed
about
one
stupid
livelihood
arnholm
no
you
will
never
need
to
waste
a
thought
upon
such
matters
and
that
a
good
thing
too
in
its
way
dear
bolette
is
it
eh
bolette
indeed
it
is
that
is
certain
arnholm
putting
his
arms
about
her
oh
you
will
see
how
comfortably
and
easily
we
shall
settle
down
together
and
how
well
and
safely
and
trustfully
we
two
shall
get
on
with
one
another
bolette
bolette
yes
i
also
begin
to
i
believe
really
it
will
answer
looks
out
to
the
right
and
hurriedly
frees
herself
oh
do
say
anything
about
this
arnholm
what
is
it
dear
bolette
oh
it
that
poor
pointing
see
out
there
arnholm
is
it
your
father
bolette
no
it
the
young
sculptor
he
down
there
with
hilde
arnholm
oh
lyngstrand
what
really
the
matter
with
him
bolette
why
you
know
how
weak
and
delicate
he
is
arnholm
yes
unless
it
simply
imaginary
bolette
no
it
real
enough
he
not
last
long
but
perhaps
best
for
him
arnholm
dear
why
should
that
be
best
bolette
because
because
nothing
would
come
of
his
art
anyhow
go
before
they
come
arnholm
gladly
my
dear
bolette
hilde
and
lyngstrand
appear
by
the
pond
hilde
hi
hi
wo
your
honours
wait
for
us
arnholm
bolette
and
i
would
rather
go
on
a
little
in
advance
he
and
bolette
go
out
to
the
left
lyngstrand
laughs
quietly
it
very
delightful
here
now
everybody
goes
about
in
pairs
always
two
and
two
together
hilde
looking
after
them
i
could
almost
swear
he
proposing
to
her
lyngstrand
really
have
you
noticed
anything
hilde
yes
it
not
very
difficult
if
you
keep
your
eyes
open
lyngstrand
but
miss
bolette
wo
have
him
i
certain
of
that
hilde
no
for
she
thinks
he
got
so
dreadfully
and
she
thinks
he
soon
get
bald
lyngstrand
it
not
only
because
of
that
she
not
have
him
anyhow
hilde
how
can
you
know
lyngstrand
well
because
there
someone
else
she
promised
to
think
of
hilde
only
to
think
of
lyngstrand
while
he
is
away
yes
hilde
oh
then
i
suppose
it
you
she
to
think
of
lyngstrand
perhaps
it
might
be
hilde
she
promised
you
that
lyngstrand
yes
think
she
promised
me
that
but
mind
you
do
tell
her
you
know
hilde
oh
i
be
mum
i
as
secret
as
the
grave
lyngstrand
i
think
it
awfully
kind
of
her
hilde
and
when
you
come
home
again
are
you
going
to
be
engaged
to
her
and
then
marry
her
lyngstrand
no
that
would
very
well
do
for
i
dare
think
of
such
a
thing
during
the
first
years
and
when
i
shall
be
able
to
she
be
rather
too
old
for
me
i
fancy
hilde
and
yet
you
wish
her
to
think
of
you
lyngstrand
yes
that
so
useful
to
me
you
see
i
an
artist
and
she
can
very
well
do
it
because
she
herself
has
no
real
calling
but
all
the
same
it
kind
of
her
hilde
do
you
think
you
be
able
to
get
on
more
quickly
with
your
work
if
you
know
that
bolette
is
here
thinking
of
you
lyngstrand
yes
i
fancy
so
to
know
there
is
a
spot
on
earth
where
a
young
gentle
reserved
woman
is
quietly
dreaming
about
you
i
fancy
it
must
be
so
i
really
do
exactly
know
what
to
call
it
hilde
perhaps
you
mean
fascinating
lyngstrand
fascinating
oh
yes
fascinating
was
what
i
meant
or
something
like
it
looks
at
her
for
a
moment
you
are
so
clever
miss
hilde
really
you
are
very
clever
when
i
come
home
again
you
be
about
the
same
age
as
your
sister
is
now
perhaps
too
you
look
like
your
sister
looks
now
and
perhaps
too
you
be
of
the
same
mind
she
is
now
then
perhaps
you
be
both
yourself
and
your
sister
in
one
form
so
to
say
hilde
would
you
like
that
lyngstrand
i
hardly
know
yes
i
almost
think
i
should
but
now
for
this
summer
i
would
rather
you
were
like
yourself
alone
and
exactly
as
you
are
hilde
do
you
like
me
best
as
i
am
lyngstrand
yes
i
like
you
immensely
as
you
are
hilde
hm
tell
me
you
who
are
an
artist
do
you
think
i
right
always
to
wear
summer
dresses
lyngstrand
yes
i
think
you
quite
right
hilde
you
think
bright
colours
suit
me
then
lyngstrand
they
suit
you
charmingly
to
my
taste
hilde
but
tell
me
as
an
artist
how
do
you
think
i
should
look
in
black
lyngstrand
in
black
miss
hilde
hilde
yes
all
in
black
do
you
think
i
should
look
well
lyngstrand
black
hardly
suitable
for
the
summer
however
probably
look
remarkably
well
in
black
especially
with
your
appearance
hilde
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
all
in
black
up
to
the
throat
black
frilling
round
that
black
gloves
and
a
long
black
veil
hanging
down
behind
lyngstrand
if
you
were
dressed
so
miss
hilde
i
should
wish
i
were
a
painter
and
i
paint
you
as
a
young
beautiful
sorrowing
widow
hilde
or
as
a
young
sorrowing
betrothed
girl
lyngstrand
yes
that
would
be
better
still
but
you
ca
wish
to
be
dressed
like
that
hilde
i
hardly
know
but
i
think
it
fascinating
lyngstrand
fascinating
hilde
fascinating
to
think
of
yes
suddenly
pointing
to
the
left
oh
just
look
there
lyngstrand
looking
the
great
english
steamer
and
right
by
the
pier
wangel
and
ellida
come
in
past
the
pond
wangel
no
i
assure
you
dear
ellida
you
are
mistaken
seeing
the
others
what
are
you
two
here
it
not
in
sight
yet
is
it
lyngstrand
lyngstrand
the
great
english
ship
wangel
yes
lyngstrand
pointing
there
she
is
already
doctor
ellida
i
knew
it
wangel
come
lyngstrand
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
as
one
might
say
so
quietly
and
noiselessly
wangel
you
must
go
to
the
pier
with
hilde
be
quick
i
sure
she
wants
to
hear
the
music
lyngstrand
yes
we
were
just
going
there
doctor
wangel
perhaps
we
follow
you
we
come
directly
hilde
whispering
to
lyngstrand
they
hunting
in
couples
too
hilde
and
lyngstrand
go
out
through
the
garden
music
is
heard
in
the
distance
out
at
the
fiord
during
the
following
ellida
come
he
is
here
yes
yes
i
feel
it
wangel
you
better
go
in
ellida
let
me
talk
with
him
alone
ellida
oh
that
impossible
impossible
i
say
with
a
cry
ah
do
you
see
him
wangel
the
stranger
enters
from
the
left
and
remains
on
the
pathway
outside
the
fence
the
stranger
bowing
you
see
i
am
here
again
ellida
ellida
yes
yes
the
time
has
come
now
the
stranger
and
are
you
ready
to
start
or
not
wangel
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
she
is
not
the
stranger
i
not
asking
about
a
travelling
dress
or
anything
of
that
kind
nor
about
packed
trunks
all
that
is
needed
for
a
journey
i
have
with
me
on
board
i
also
secured
a
cabin
for
her
to
ellida
so
i
ask
you
if
you
are
ready
to
go
with
me
to
go
with
me
freely
ellida
oh
do
not
ask
me
do
not
tempt
me
a
ship
bell
is
heard
in
the
distance
the
stranger
that
is
the
first
bell
for
going
on
board
now
you
must
say
yes
or
no
ellida
wringing
her
hands
to
decide
decide
for
one
whole
life
never
to
be
able
to
undo
it
again
the
stranger
never
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
too
late
ellida
looking
shyly
and
searchingly
at
him
why
is
it
you
hold
to
me
so
resolutely
the
stranger
do
you
feel
as
i
do
that
we
two
belong
together
ellida
do
you
mean
because
of
the
vow
the
stranger
vows
bind
no
one
neither
man
nor
woman
if
i
hold
so
steadfastly
to
you
it
is
because
i
can
not
do
otherwise
ellida
in
a
low
trembling
voice
why
did
you
come
before
wangel
ellida
ellida
bursting
out
ah
all
that
attracts
and
tempts
and
lures
into
the
unknown
all
the
strength
of
the
sea
concentrated
in
this
one
thing
the
stranger
climbs
over
the
fence
ellida
stepping
back
to
wangel
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
the
stranger
i
see
it
and
i
hear
it
in
you
ellida
after
all
you
will
choose
me
in
the
end
wangel
going
towards
him
my
wife
has
no
choice
here
i
am
here
both
to
choose
for
her
and
to
defend
her
yes
defend
if
you
do
not
go
away
from
here
away
from
this
land
and
never
come
back
again
do
you
know
to
what
you
are
exposing
yourself
ellida
no
no
wangel
not
that
the
stranger
what
will
you
do
to
me
wangel
i
will
have
you
arrested
as
a
criminal
at
once
before
you
go
on
board
for
i
know
all
about
the
murder
at
skjoldviken
ellida
ah
wangel
how
can
you
the
stranger
i
was
prepared
for
that
and
so
takes
a
revolver
from
his
breast
pocket
i
provided
myself
with
this
ellida
throwing
herself
in
front
of
him
no
no
do
not
kill
him
better
kill
me
the
stranger
neither
you
nor
him
do
fear
that
this
is
for
myself
for
i
will
live
and
die
a
free
man
ellida
with
growing
excitement
wangel
let
me
tell
you
this
tell
it
you
so
that
he
may
hear
it
you
can
indeed
keep
me
here
you
have
the
means
and
the
power
to
do
it
and
you
intend
to
do
it
but
my
mind
all
my
thoughts
all
the
longings
and
desires
of
my
soul
these
you
can
not
bind
these
will
rush
and
press
out
into
the
unknown
that
i
was
created
for
and
that
you
have
kept
from
me
wangel
in
quiet
sorrow
i
see
it
ellida
step
by
step
you
are
slipping
from
me
the
craving
for
the
boundless
the
infinite
the
unattainable
will
drive
your
soul
into
the
darkness
of
night
at
last
ellida
yes
i
feel
it
hovering
over
me
like
black
noiseless
wings
wangel
it
shall
not
come
to
that
no
other
deliverance
is
possible
for
you
i
at
least
can
see
no
other
and
so
so
i
cry
off
our
bargain
at
once
now
you
can
choose
your
own
path
in
perfect
perfect
freedom
ellida
stares
at
him
a
while
as
if
stricken
dumb
is
it
true
true
what
you
say
do
you
mean
that
mean
it
with
all
your
heart
wangel
yes
with
all
my
sorrowing
heart
i
mean
it
ellida
and
can
you
do
it
can
you
let
it
be
so
wangel
yes
i
can
because
i
love
you
so
dearly
ellida
in
a
low
trembling
voice
and
have
i
come
so
near
so
close
to
you
wangel
the
years
and
the
living
together
have
done
that
ellida
clasping
her
hands
together
and
i
who
so
little
understood
this
wangel
your
thoughts
went
elsewhere
and
now
now
you
are
completely
free
of
me
and
mine
and
and
mine
now
your
own
true
life
may
resume
its
real
bent
again
for
now
you
can
choose
in
freedom
and
on
your
own
responsibility
ellida
ellida
clasps
her
head
with
her
hands
and
stares
at
wangel
in
freedom
and
on
my
own
responsibility
responsibility
too
that
changes
everything
the
ship
bell
rings
again
the
stranger
do
you
hear
ellida
it
has
rung
now
for
the
last
time
come
ellida
turns
towards
him
looks
firmly
at
him
and
speaks
in
a
resolute
voice
i
shall
never
go
with
you
after
this
the
stranger
you
will
not
ellida
clinging
to
wangel
i
shall
never
go
away
from
you
after
this
the
stranger
so
it
is
over
ellida
yes
over
for
all
time
the
stranger
i
see
there
is
something
here
stronger
than
my
will
ellida
your
will
has
not
a
shadow
of
power
over
me
any
longer
to
me
you
are
as
one
dead
who
has
come
home
from
the
sea
and
who
returns
to
it
again
i
no
longer
dread
you
and
i
am
no
longer
drawn
to
you
the
stranger
goodbye
wangel
he
swings
himself
over
the
fence
henceforth
you
are
nothing
but
a
shipwreck
in
my
life
that
i
have
tided
over
he
goes
out
wangel
looks
at
her
for
a
while
ellida
your
mind
is
like
the
sea
it
has
ebb
and
flow
whence
came
the
change
ellida
ah
do
you
understand
that
the
change
came
was
bound
to
come
when
i
could
choose
in
freedom
wangel
and
the
unknown
it
no
longer
lures
you
ellida
neither
lures
nor
frightens
me
i
could
have
seen
it
gone
out
into
it
if
only
i
myself
had
willed
it
i
could
have
chosen
it
and
that
is
why
i
could
also
renounce
it
wangel
i
begin
to
understand
little
by
little
you
think
and
conceive
in
pictures
in
visible
figures
your
longing
and
aching
for
the
sea
your
attraction
towards
this
strange
man
these
were
the
expression
of
an
awakening
and
growing
desire
for
freedom
nothing
else
ellida
i
do
know
about
that
but
you
have
been
a
good
physician
for
me
you
found
and
you
dared
to
use
the
right
remedy
the
only
one
that
could
help
me
wangel
yes
in
utmost
need
and
danger
we
doctors
dare
much
and
now
you
are
coming
back
to
me
again
ellida
ellida
yes
dear
faithful
wangel
now
i
am
coming
back
to
you
again
now
i
can
for
now
i
come
to
you
freely
and
on
my
own
responsibility
wangel
looks
lovingly
at
her
ellida
ellida
to
think
that
now
we
can
live
wholly
for
one
another
ellida
and
with
common
memories
yours
as
well
as
mine
wangel
yes
indeed
dear
ellida
and
for
our
children
wangel
wangel
you
call
them
ours
ellida
they
who
are
not
mine
yet
but
whom
i
shall
win
wangel
ours
gladly
and
quickly
kisses
her
hands
i
can
not
speak
my
thanks
for
those
words
hilde
ballested
lyngstrand
arnholm
and
bolette
come
into
the
garden
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
young
townspeople
and
visitors
pass
along
the
footpath
hilde
aside
to
lyngstrand
see
why
she
and
father
look
exactly
as
if
they
were
a
betrothed
couple
ballested
who
has
overheard
it
is
summertime
little
missie
arnholm
looking
at
wangel
and

english
steamer

putting
off

see
her
best
from
here
lyngstrand
the
last
voyage
this
year

the
will

as
the
poet

for
a
time
tomorrow

to
skjoldviken

to
the
other

between
tears
and
laughter

is
quite
a
surprise
ellida
smiling
earnestly
well

you
remember
we
talked
about
it
yesterday
when
you
have
once
become
a
you
can
no
longer
find
your
way
back
again
to
the
sea
nor
to
the
either
ballested
why
that
exactly
the
case
with
my
mermaid
ellida
something
like
yes
ballested
only
with
this
difference
that
the
mermaid
dies
of
it
it
while
human
beings
can
acclam
acclimatise
themselves
yes
yes
i
assure
you
wangel
they
can
themselves
ellida
in
freedom
they
can
ballested
wangel
and
when
they
act
on
their
own
responsibility
dear
ellida
ellida
quickly
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
exactly
the
great
steamer
glides
noiselessly
out
beyond
the
fjord
the
music
is
heard
nearer
land
