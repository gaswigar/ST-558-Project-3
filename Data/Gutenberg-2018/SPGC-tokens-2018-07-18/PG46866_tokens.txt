the
adventures
of
peter
cottontail
peter
rabbit
decides
to
change
his
name
rabbit
peter
rabbit
i
do
see
what
mother
nature
ever
gave
me
such
a
common
sounding
name
as
that
for
people
laugh
at
me
but
if
i
had
a
fine
sounding
name
they
would
laugh
some
folks
say
that
a
name
does
amount
to
anything
but
it
does
if
i
should
do
some
wonderful
thing
nobody
would
think
anything
of
it
no
sir
nobody
would
think
anything
of
it
at
all
just
because
why
just
because
it
was
done
by
peter
rabbit
peter
was
talking
out
loud
but
he
was
talking
to
himself
he
sat
in
the
dear
old
with
an
ugly
scowl
on
his
usually
happy
face
the
sun
was
shining
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
were
dancing
over
the
green
meadows
the
birds
were
singing
and
happiness
the
glad
joyous
happiness
of
springtime
was
everywhere
but
in
peter
rabbit
heart
there
there
seeded
to
be
no
room
for
anything
but
discontent
and
such
foolish
discontent
discontent
with
his
name
and
yet
do
you
know
there
are
lots
of
people
just
as
foolish
as
peter
rabbit
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
the
voice
made
peter
rabbit
jump
and
turn
around
hastily
there
was
jimmy
skunk
poking
his
head
in
at
the
opening
of
one
of
peter
private
little
paths
he
was
grinning
and
peter
knew
by
that
grin
that
jimmy
had
heard
what
he
had
said
peter
did
know
what
to
say
he
hung
his
head
in
a
very
way
you
got
something
to
learn
said
jimmy
skunk
what
is
it
asked
peter
it
just
this
replied
jimmy
there
nothing
in
a
name
except
just
what
we
choose
to
make
it
it
lies
with
us
and
no
one
else
how
other
folks
shall
take
it
it
what
we
do
and
what
we
say
and
how
we
live
each
passing
day
that
makes
it
big
or
makes
it
small
or
even
worse
than
none
at
all
a
name
just
stands
for
what
we
are
it
what
we
choose
to
make
it
and
that
the
way
and
only
way
that
other
folks
will
take
it
peter
rabbit
made
a
face
at
jimmy
skunk
i
do
like
being
preached
to
i
not
preaching
i
just
telling
you
what
you
ought
to
know
without
being
told
replied
jimmy
skunk
if
you
do
like
your
name
why
do
you
change
it
what
that
cried
peter
sharply
if
you
do
like
your
name
why
do
you
change
it
repeated
jimmy
peter
sat
up
and
the
disagreeable
frown
had
left
his
face
i
i
thought
of
that
he
said
slowly
do
you
suppose
i
could
jimmy
skunk
easiest
thing
in
the
world
replied
jimmy
skunk
just
decide
what
name
you
like
and
then
ask
all
your
friends
to
call
you
by
it
i
believe
i
will
cried
peter
rabbit
well
let
me
know
what
it
is
when
you
have
decided
said
jimmy
as
he
started
for
home
and
all
the
way
up
the
crooked
little
path
jimmy
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
foolish
peter
rabbit
trying
to
change
his
name
ii
peter
finds
a
name
rabbit
had
quite
lost
his
appetite
when
peter
forgets
to
eat
you
may
make
up
your
mind
that
peter
has
something
very
important
to
think
about
at
least
he
has
something
on
his
mind
that
he
thinks
is
important
the
fact
is
peter
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
change
his
name
he
thought
peter
rabbit
too
common
a
name
but
when
he
tried
to
think
of
a
better
one
he
found
that
no
name
that
he
could
think
of
really
pleased
him
any
more
so
he
thought
and
he
thought
and
he
thought
and
he
thought
and
the
more
he
thought
the
less
appetite
he
had
now
jimmy
skunk
was
the
only
one
to
whom
peter
had
told
how
discontented
he
was
with
his
name
and
it
was
jimmy
who
had
suggested
to
peter
that
he
change
it
jimmy
thought
it
a
great
joke
and
he
straightway
passed
the
word
along
among
all
the
little
meadow
and
forest
people
that
peter
rabbit
was
going
to
change
his
name
everybody
laughed
and
chuckled
over
the
thought
of
peter
rabbit
foolishness
and
they
planned
to
have
a
great
deal
of
fun
with
peter
as
soon
as
he
should
tell
them
his
new
name
peter
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
old
one
morning
when
ol
mistah
buzzard
passed
flying
low
good
brer
cottontail
said
ol
mistah
buzzard
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
at
first
peter
did
understand
that
ol
mistah
buzzard
was
speaking
to
him
and
by
the
time
he
did
it
was
too
late
to
reply
for
ol
mistah
buzzard
was
way
way
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
cottontail
cottontail
said
peter
over
and
over
to
himself
and
began
to
smile
every
time
he
said
it
he
liked
it
better
illustration
cottontail
peter
cottontail
how
much
better
sounding
that
is
than
peter
rabbit
that
sounds
as
if
i
really
was
somebody
yes
sir
the
very
name
i
want
now
i
must
send
word
to
all
my
friends
that
hereafter
i
am
no
longer
peter
rabbit
but
peter
cottontail
peter
kicked
up
his
heels
in
just
the
funny
way
he
always
does
when
he
is
pleased
suddenly
he
remembered
that
such
a
fine
long
name
as
peter
cottontail
demanded
dignity
so
he
stopped
kicking
up
his
heels
and
began
to
practise
putting
on
airs
but
first
he
called
to
the
merry
little
breezes
and
told
them
about
his
change
of
name
and
asked
them
to
tell
all
his
friends
that
in
the
future
he
would
not
answer
to
the
name
of
peter
rabbit
but
only
to
the
name
of
peter
cottontail
he
was
very
grave
and
earnest
and
important
as
he
explained
it
to
the
merry
little
breezes
the
merry
little
breezes
kept
their
faces
straight
while
he
was
talking
but
as
soon
as
they
had
left
him
to
carry
his
message
they
burst
out
laughing
it
was
such
a
joke
and
they
giggled
as
they
delivered
this
message
to
each
of
the
little
forest
and
meadow
people
peter
rabbit
changed
his
name
in
the
future
without
fail
you
must
call
him
if
you
please
peter
cottontail
while
they
were
doing
this
peter
was
back
in
the
old
practising
new
airs
and
trying
to
look
very
high
and
mighty
and
important
as
became
one
with
such
a
fine
sounding
name
as
peter
cottontail
iii
there
nothing
like
the
old
name
after
all
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
had
their
heads
together
now
when
these
two
put
their
heads
together
you
may
make
up
your
mind
that
they
are
planning
mischief
yes
sir
there
is
sure
to
be
mischief
afoot
when
bobby
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
put
their
heads
together
as
they
were
doing
now
had
peter
rabbit
seen
them
he
might
not
have
felt
so
easy
in
his
mind
as
he
did
but
peter
did
see
them
he
was
too
much
taken
up
with
trying
to
look
as
important
as
his
new
name
sounded
he
was
putting
on
airs
and
holding
his
head
very
high
as
he
went
down
to
the
smiling
pool
to
call
on
jeny
muskrat
whenever
any
one
called
him
by
his
old
name
peter
pretended
not
to
hear
he
pretended
that
he
had
never
heard
that
name
and
did
know
that
he
was
being
spoken
to
bobby
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
thought
it
a
great
joke
and
they
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
have
some
fun
with
peter
and
perhaps
make
him
see
how
very
foolish
he
was
yes
sir
they
planned
to
teach
peter
a
lesson
bobby
coon
hurried
away
to
find
reddy
fox
and
tell
him
that
peter
had
gone
down
to
the
smiling
pool
and
that
if
he
hid
beside
the
path
he
might
catch
peter
on
the
way
back
jimmy
skunk
hunted
up
blacky
the
crow
and
sammy
jay
and
told
them
of
his
plan
and
what
he
wanted
them
to
do
to
help
of
course
they
promised
that
they
would
then
he
went
to
ol
mistah
buzzard
and
told
him
ol
mistah
buzzard
grinned
and
promised
that
he
would
do
his
share
then
bobby
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
hid
where
they
could
see
all
that
would
happen
peter
had
reached
the
smiling
pool
and
now
sat
on
the
bank
admiring
his
own
reflection
in
the
water
and
talking
to
jerry
muskrat
he
had
just
told
jerry
that
when
his
old
name
was
called
out
he
did
hear
it
any
more
when
along
came
blacky
the
crow
hello
peter
rabbit
you
just
the
fellow
i
am
looking
for
i
a
very
important
message
for
you
shouted
blacky
peter
kept
right
on
talking
with
jerry
muskrat
just
as
if
he
hear
although
he
was
burning
with
curiosity
to
know
what
the
message
was
i
say
peter
rabbit
are
you
deaf
shouted
blacky
the
crow
jerry
muskrat
looked
up
at
blacky
and
winked
peter
rabbit
is
here
said
he
this
is
peter
cottontail
illustration
oh
said
blacky
my
message
is
for
peter
rabbit
and
it
something
he
really
ought
to
know
i
sorry
he
is
here
and
with
that
away
flew
blacky
the
crow
chuckling
to
himself
peter
looked
quite
as
uncomfortable
as
he
felt
but
of
course
he
could
say
a
word
after
boasting
that
he
did
hear
people
who
called
him
peter
rabbit
pretty
soon
along
came
sammy
jay
sammy
seemed
very
much
excited
oh
peter
rabbit
i
so
glad
i
found
you
he
cried
i
some
very
important
news
for
you
peter
had
all
he
could
do
to
sit
still
and
pretend
not
to
hear
but
he
did
this
is
peter
cottontail
said
jerry
muskrat
winking
at
sammy
jay
oh
replied
sammy
my
news
is
for
peter
rabbit
and
off
he
flew
chuckling
to
himself
peter
looked
and
felt
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
he
bade
jerry
muskrat
and
started
for
the
dear
old
to
think
things
over
when
he
was
half
way
there
ol
mistah
buzzard
came
sailing
down
out
of
the
sky
brer
cottontail
said
he
if
yo
see
anything
of
brer
rabbit
tell
him
that
brer
fox
am
hiding
behind
that
big
bunch
of
grass
just
ahead
peter
stopped
short
and
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
there
behind
the
clump
of
grass
was
something
red
sure
enough
peter
did
wait
to
see
more
he
started
for
a
hiding
place
he
knew
of
in
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
he
could
go
and
behind
him
raced
reddy
fox
as
he
ran
he
heard
blacky
the
crow
and
sammy
jay
laughing
and
then
he
knew
that
this
was
the
news
that
they
had
had
for
him
i
i
guess
that
peter
rabbit
is
a
good
enough
name
after
all
he
panted
iv
peter
rabbit
fools
jimmy
skunk
rabbit
came
hopping
and
skipping
down
the
crooked
little
path
unc
billy
possum
always
calls
him
brer
rabbit
but
everybody
else
calls
him
peter
peter
was
feeling
very
fine
that
morning
very
fine
indeed
every
few
minutes
he
jumped
up
in
the
air
and
kicked
his
heels
together
just
for
fun
presently
he
met
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
was
on
his
way
back
from
farmer
brown
corn
field
where
he
had
been
helping
blacky
the
crow
get
free
from
a
snare
jimmy
was
still
tickling
and
laughing
over
the
way
blacky
the
crow
had
been
caught
he
had
to
tell
peter
rabbit
all
about
it
peter
thought
it
just
as
good
a
joke
as
did
jimmy
and
the
two
trotted
along
side
by
side
planning
how
they
would
spread
the
news
all
over
the
green
meadows
that
blacky
the
crow
who
thinks
himself
so
smart
had
been
caught
that
reminds
me
said
jimmy
skunk
suddenly
i
have
had
my
breakfast
yet
have
you
seen
any
beetles
this
morning
peter
rabbit
peter
rabbit
stopped
and
scratched
his
long
left
ear
with
his
long
left
hind
foot
now
you
speak
of
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
did
said
peter
rabbit
where
asked
jimmy
skunk
eagerly
peter
pretended
to
think
very
hard
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
back
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
up
the
hill
said
peter
i
think
i
will
go
look
for
them
at
once
replied
jimmy
all
right
replied
peter
i
show
you
the
way
so
up
the
crooked
little
path
hopped
peter
rabbit
and
right
behind
him
trotted
jimmy
skunk
by
and
by
they
came
to
an
old
pine
stump
peter
rabbit
stopped
he
put
one
hand
on
his
lips
hush
whispered
peter
i
think
there
is
a
whole
family
of
beetles
on
the
other
side
of
this
stump
you
creep
around
the
other
side
and
creep
around
this
side
when
i
thump
the
ground
you
spring
right
around
and
grab
them
before
they
can
run
away
so
jimmy
skunk
crept
around
one
side
of
the
stump
and
peter
rabbit
crept
around
the
other
side
suddenly
peter
thumped
the
ground
hard
twice
jimmy
skunk
was
waiting
and
all
ready
to
spring
when
he
heard
those
thumps
he
just
sprang
as
quickly
as
he
could
what
do
you
think
happened
why
jimmy
skunk
landed
right
on
reddy
fox
who
was
taking
a
sun
nap
on
the
other
side
of
the
pine
stump
ha
ha
ha
shouted
peter
rabbit
and
started
down
the
crooked
little
path
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
reddy
pox
gets
into
trouble
fox
curled
up
behind
the
big
pine
stump
was
dreaming
of
a
coop
full
of
chickens
where
there
was
no
bowser
the
hound
to
watch
over
them
suddenly
something
landed
on
him
with
a
thump
that
knocked
all
his
breath
out
for
an
instant
it
frightened
reddy
so
that
he
just
shook
and
shook
then
he
got
his
senses
together
and
discovered
that
it
was
jimmy
skunk
who
had
jumped
on
him
jimmy
was
very
polite
he
begged
reddy
pardon
he
protested
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
explained
how
peter
rabbit
had
played
a
trick
on
both
of
them
and
how
he
himself
was
just
looking
for
beetles
for
breakfast
now
reddy
fox
is
very
quick
tempered
and
as
soon
as
he
realized
that
he
had
been
made
the
victim
of
a
joke
he
lost
his
temper
completely
he
glared
at
jimmy
skunk
he
was
so
angry
that
he
stuttered
did
that
on
said
reddy
fox
no
such
thing
declared
jimmy
skunk
i
tell
you
it
was
a
joke
on
the
part
of
peter
rabbit
and
if
you
do
believe
me
just
look
down
there
on
the
green
meadows
reddy
fox
looked
there
sat
peter
his
hands
on
his
hips
his
long
ears
pointed
straight
up
to
the
blue
sky
and
his
mouth
wide
open
as
he
laughed
at
the
results
of
his
joke
reddy
shook
his
fist
ha
ha
ha
shouted
peter
rabbit
reddy
fox
looked
hard
at
jimmy
skunk
but
like
all
the
other
little
meadow
and
forest
people
he
has
a
very
great
respect
for
jimmy
skunk
and
though
he
would
have
liked
to
quarrel
with
jimmy
he
thought
it
wisest
not
to
instead
he
started
after
peter
rabbit
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
go
now
reddy
fox
can
run
very
fast
and
when
peter
saw
him
coming
peter
knew
that
he
would
have
to
use
his
own
long
legs
to
the
very
best
of
his
ability
away
they
went
across
the
green
meadows
jimmy
skunk
sitting
on
top
of
the
hill
could
see
the
white
patch
on
the
seat
of
peter
rabbit
trousers
bobbing
this
way
and
that
way
and
right
behind
him
was
reddy
fox
now
peter
rabbit
could
run
fast
enough
to
keep
away
from
reddy
for
a
while
you
remember
that
peter
eyes
are
so
placed
that
he
can
see
behind
him
without
turning
his
head
so
he
knew
when
reddy
was
getting
too
near
in
and
out
among
the
bushes
along
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
they
dodged
and
the
more
he
had
to
run
the
angrier
reddy
fox
grew
he
paid
no
attention
to
where
they
were
going
his
whole
thought
was
of
catching
peter
rabbit
now
when
peter
began
to
grow
tired
he
began
to
work
over
towards
farmer
brown
corn
field
where
he
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
hiding
with
bowser
the
hound
dodging
this
way
and
that
way
peter
worked
over
to
the
fence
corner
where
jimmy
skunk
had
watched
blacky
the
crow
get
caught
in
a
snare
he
let
reddy
almost
catch
him
then
he
dodged
out
into
the
open
corn
field
and
reddy
of
course
followed
him
reddy
did
not
need
to
turn
to
know
what
had
happened
bowser
the
hound
had
seen
him
and
was
after
him
peter
just
ducked
behind
a
big
bunch
of
grass
and
sat
down
to
get
his
breath
while
reddy
started
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
with
bowser
the
hound
behind
him
vi
reddy
fools
bowser
the
hound
across
the
green
meadows
and
up
the
hill
through
the
green
forest
raced
reddy
fox
at
the
top
of
his
speed
behind
him
nose
to
the
ground
came
bowser
the
hound
baying
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
reddy
ran
along
an
old
stone
wall
and
jumped
as
far
out
into
the
field
as
he
could
i
guess
that
will
fool
him
for
a
while
panted
reddy
as
he
sat
down
to
get
his
breath
when
bowser
came
to
the
place
where
reddy
had
jumped
on
the
stone
wall
he
just
grinned
that
too
old
a
trick
to
fool
me
one
minute
said
bowser
to
himself
and
he
just
made
a
big
circle
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
found
reddy
tracks
again
every
trick
that
reddy
had
heard
old
granny
fox
tell
about
he
tried
in
order
to
fool
bowser
the
hound
but
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
bowser
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
reddy
was
doing
and
wasted
no
time
reddy
was
beginning
to
get
worried
he
was
getting
dreadfully
out
of
breath
his
legs
ached
his
big
plumey
tail
of
which
he
is
very
very
proud
had
become
dreadfully
heavy
granny
fox
had
warned
him
never
never
to
run
into
the
snug
house
they
had
dug
unless
he
was
obliged
to
to
save
his
life
for
that
would
tell
bowser
the
hound
where
they
lived
and
then
they
would
have
to
move
how
reddy
did
wish
that
wise
old
granny
fox
would
come
to
his
relief
he
was
running
along
the
back
of
farmer
brown
pasture
and
he
could
hear
bowser
the
hound
altogether
too
near
for
comfort
he
looked
this
way
and
he
looked
that
way
for
a
chance
to
escape
just
ahead
of
him
he
saw
a
lot
of
woolly
friends
they
were
farmer
brown
sheep
reddy
had
a
bright
idea
like
a
flash
he
sprang
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
sheep
it
frightened
the
sheep
as
badly
as
reddy
had
been
frightened
when
jimmy
skunk
had
landed
on
him
that
morning
baa
baa
baa
cried
the
sheep
and
started
to
run
reddy
hung
on
tightly
and
away
they
raced
across
the
pasture
now
bowser
the
hound
trusts
wholly
to
his
nose
to
follow
reddy
fox
or
peter
rabbit
or
his
master
farmer
brown
boy
so
he
did
not
see
reddy
jump
on
the
back
of
the
sheep
and
of
course
when
he
reached
the
place
where
reddy
had
found
his
strange
horse
he
was
puzzled
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
bowser
worked
in
a
circle
but
no
trace
of
reddy
could
he
find
and
all
the
time
reddy
sat
behind
the
stone
wall
on
the
far
side
of
the
pasture
getting
his
wind
and
laughing
and
laughing
at
the
smart
way
in
which
he
had
fooled
bowser
the
hound
vii
reddy
invites
peter
rabbit
to
take
a
walk
granny
fox
was
not
feeling
well
for
three
days
she
had
been
unable
to
go
out
hunting
and
for
three
days
reddy
fox
had
tried
to
find
something
to
tempt
granny
appetite
he
had
brought
in
a
tender
young
chicken
from
farmer
brown
hen
yard
and
he
had
stolen
a
plump
trout
from
billy
mink
storehouse
but
granny
had
just
turned
up
her
nose
what
i
need
said
granny
fox
is
a
tender
young
rabbit
now
reddy
fox
is
very
fond
of
granny
fox
and
when
she
said
that
she
needed
a
tender
young
rabbit
reddy
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
get
it
for
her
though
how
he
was
going
to
do
it
he
did
know
dozens
of
times
he
had
tried
to
catch
peter
rabbit
and
every
time
peter
long
legs
had
taken
him
to
a
place
of
safety
i
just
have
to
fool
peter
rabbit
said
reddy
fox
as
he
sat
on
his
and
looked
over
the
green
meadows
reddy
fox
is
very
sly
he
is
so
sly
that
it
is
hard
work
to
be
sure
when
he
is
honest
and
when
he
is
playing
a
trick
as
he
sat
on
his
looking
across
the
green
meadows
he
saw
the
merry
little
breezes
coming
his
way
reddy
smiled
to
himself
when
they
got
near
enough
he
shouted
to
them
will
you
do
something
for
me
he
asked
of
course
we
will
shouted
the
merry
little
breezes
who
are
always
delighted
to
do
something
for
others
i
wish
you
would
find
peter
rabbit
and
tell
him
that
i
have
found
a
new
bed
of
tender
young
carrots
in
farmer
brown
garden
and
invite
him
to
go
there
with
me
morning
at
said
reddy
fox
away
raced
the
merry
little
breezes
to
find
peter
rabbit
and
give
him
the
invitation
of
reddy
fox
pretty
soon
back
they
came
to
tell
reddy
that
peter
rabbit
would
be
delighted
to
meet
reddy
on
the
edge
of
the
old
at
the
next
morning
and
go
with
him
to
get
some
tender
young
carrots
reddy
smiled
to
himself
for
now
he
was
sure
that
he
would
get
peter
rabbit
for
granny
breakfast
early
the
next
morning
just
before
reddy
fox
started
down
the
lone
little
path
and
hurried
across
the
green
meadows
to
the
old
reddy
was
dressed
in
his
very
best
suit
of
clothes
and
very
smart
and
handsome
he
looked
when
he
reached
the
old
he
could
see
nothing
of
peter
rabbit
he
waited
and
waited
and
waited
but
still
peter
rabbit
did
not
come
finally
he
gave
it
up
and
decided
that
he
would
go
over
and
have
a
look
at
the
young
carrots
in
farmer
brown
garden
when
he
got
there
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
all
around
that
bed
of
tender
young
carrots
were
footprints
and
the
footprints
were
peter
rabbit
reddy
fox
ground
his
teeth
and
snarled
wickedly
for
he
knew
then
that
instead
of
fooling
peter
rabbit
peter
rabbit
had
fooled
him
just
then
up
came
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
good
morning
reddy
fox
said
the
merry
little
breeze
good
morning
replied
reddy
fox
and
if
you
could
have
seen
him
and
heard
him
you
would
never
have
suspected
how
he
was
feeling
peter
rabbit
asked
me
to
come
and
tell
you
that
he
is
very
sorry
that
he
could
not
meet
you
at
the
this
morning
but
that
he
grew
so
hungry
thinking
of
those
tender
young
carrots
that
he
just
had
to
come
and
get
some
before
and
he
is
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
him
about
them
he
says
they
are
the
finest
young
carrots
that
he
has
ever
tasted
said
the
merry
little
breeze
the
heart
of
reddy
fox
was
filled
with
rage
but
he
did
not
let
the
merry
little
breeze
know
it
he
just
smiled
and
sent
the
merry
little
breeze
back
to
peter
rabbit
to
tell
him
how
glad
he
was
that
peter
enjoyed
the
carrots
and
to
invite
peter
to
meet
him
the
next
morning
on
the
edge
of
the
old
at
to
go
with
him
to
a
patch
of
sweet
clover
which
he
had
just
found
near
the
old
the
merry
little
breeze
danced
off
with
the
message
pretty
soon
he
was
back
to
say
that
peter
rabbit
would
be
delighted
to
go
to
the
sweet
clover
patch
the
next
morning
reddy
grinned
as
he
trudged
off
home
i
just
be
at
the
clover
patch
an
hour
before
morning
and
then
we
see
he
said
to
himself
viii
peter
rabbit
gets
an
early
breakfast
rabbit
crept
out
of
his
snug
little
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
old
two
hours
before
and
hurried
over
to
the
big
sure
enough
close
by
he
found
a
beautiful
bed
of
sweet
clover
just
as
reddy
fox
had
said
was
there
peter
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
ate
and
ate
and
ate
until
his
little
round
stomach
was
so
full
that
he
could
hardly
hop
when
he
had
eaten
all
that
he
could
he
hurried
back
to
the
old
to
finish
his
morning
nap
and
all
the
time
he
kept
chuckling
to
himself
you
see
peter
was
suspicious
of
reddy
fox
and
so
he
had
gone
over
to
the
sweet
clover
bed
alone
two
hours
before
peter
rabbit
had
hardly
left
the
sweet
clover
bed
when
reddy
fox
arrived
reddy
lay
down
in
the
long
meadow
grass
and
grinned
to
himself
as
he
waited
slowly
the
minutes
went
by
until
up
from
behind
the
purple
hills
came
jolly
round
red
sun
but
no
peter
rabbit
reddy
stopped
grinning
perhaps
said
he
to
himself
peter
is
waiting
for
me
on
the
edge
of
the
old
and
was
going
to
try
to
fool
me
so
reddy
hurried
over
to
the
old
and
sure
enough
there
was
peter
rabbit
on
the
edge
of
it
when
peter
saw
him
coming
he
dodged
in
behind
a
big
clump
of
friendly
old
brambles
reddy
came
up
with
his
broadest
smile
good
morning
peter
rabbit
said
reddy
shall
we
go
over
to
that
sweet
clover
bed
illustration
peter
put
one
hand
over
his
mouth
to
hide
a
smile
oh
said
he
i
was
so
dreadfully
hungry
for
sweet
clover
that
i
could
wait
until
and
so
i
went
over
two
hours
ago
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
reddy
fox
i
certainly
do
appreciate
your
kindness
in
telling
me
of
that
new
sweet
clover
bed
and
i
hope
i
have
not
put
you
out
certainly
not
replied
reddy
fox
in
his
pleasantest
manner
and
you
know
reddy
fox
can
be
very
pleasant
indeed
when
he
wants
to
be
it
is
a
very
great
pleasure
to
be
able
to
give
you
pleasure
there
is
nothing
i
so
like
to
do
as
to
give
pleasure
to
others
by
the
way
i
have
just
heard
that
farmer
brown
has
a
new
planting
of
young
cabbage
in
the
corner
of
his
garden
will
you
meet
me
here
at
morning
to
go
over
there
i
will
be
delighted
to
i
will
indeed
replied
peter
rabbit
and
all
the
time
he
smiled
to
himself
behind
his
hand
reddy
fox
bade
peter
rabbit
in
the
pleasantest
way
you
can
imagine
yet
all
the
time
down
in
his
heart
reddy
was
so
angry
that
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
for
you
see
he
had
got
to
go
back
to
granny
fox
without
the
tender
young
rabbit
which
he
had
promised
her
this
time
i
will
be
there
two
hours
before
and
then
we
will
see
peter
rabbit
who
is
the
smartest
said
reddy
fox
to
himself
ix
reddy
fox
gets
a
scare
rabbit
looked
up
at
the
silvery
moon
and
laughed
aloud
then
he
kicked
up
his
heels
and
laughed
again
as
he
started
out
across
the
green
meadows
towards
fanner
brown
garden
you
see
peter
was
suspicious
very
suspicious
indeed
of
reddy
fox
so
as
it
was
a
beautiful
night
for
a
walk
he
thought
he
would
just
run
over
to
farmer
brown
garden
and
see
if
he
could
find
that
bed
of
newly
planted
cabbage
about
which
reddy
fox
had
told
him
so
peter
hopped
and
skipped
across
the
green
meadows
singing
as
he
went
hold
ol
miss
moon
hold
up
your
light
show
the
way
show
the
way
the
little
stars
are
shining
bright
night
folks
all
are
out
to
play
when
peter
reached
farmer
brown
garden
he
had
no
trouble
in
finding
the
new
planting
of
cabbage
it
was
tender
it
was
good
my
how
good
it
was
peter
started
in
to
fill
his
little
round
stomach
he
ate
and
ate
and
ate
and
ate
by
and
by
just
when
he
thought
he
could
eat
another
mouthful
he
happened
to
look
over
to
a
patch
of
moonlight
for
just
a
second
peter
heart
stopped
beating
there
was
reddy
fox
coming
straight
over
to
the
new
cabbage
bed
peter
rabbit
did
know
what
to
do
reddy
fox
had
seen
him
yet
but
he
would
in
a
minute
or
two
unless
peter
could
hide
he
was
too
far
from
the
dear
old
to
run
there
peter
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
ha
ha
there
lay
fanner
brown
boy
old
straw
hat
just
where
he
had
left
it
when
the
supper
horn
blew
peter
crawled
under
it
it
covered
him
completely
peter
peeped
out
from
under
one
edge
he
saw
reddy
fox
standing
in
the
moonlight
looking
at
the
bed
of
newly
set
cabbage
reddy
was
smiling
as
if
his
thoughts
were
very
pleasant
peter
shivered
he
could
just
guess
what
reddy
was
thinking
how
he
would
gobble
up
peter
when
once
he
got
him
away
from
the
safety
of
the
old
the
thought
made
peter
so
indignant
that
he
forgot
that
he
was
hiding
and
he
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
of
course
he
lifted
the
straw
hat
with
him
then
he
remembered
and
sat
down
again
in
a
hurry
of
course
the
straw
hat
went
down
quite
as
quickly
presently
peter
peeped
out
reddy
fox
was
staring
and
staring
at
the
old
straw
hat
and
he
was
smiling
now
he
actually
looked
frightened
it
gave
peter
an
idea
he
made
three
long
hops
straight
towards
reddy
fox
all
the
time
keeping
the
old
straw
hat
over
him
of
course
the
hat
went
along
with
him
and
because
it
covered
peter
all
up
it
looked
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
hat
was
alive
reddy
fox
gave
one
more
long
look
at
the
strange
thing
coming
towards
him
through
the
cabbage
bed
and
then
he
started
for
home
as
fast
as
he
could
go
his
tail
between
his
legs
peter
rabbit
just
lay
down
right
where
he
was
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
old
straw
hat
laughed
too
peter
has
another
great
laugh
was
just
as
reddy
fox
started
down
the
lone
little
path
to
the
green
meadows
reddy
was
late
he
should
be
over
at
the
old
by
this
time
he
was
afraid
now
that
peter
rabbit
would
not
be
there
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
old
there
sat
peter
on
the
edge
of
it
good
morning
peter
rabbit
said
reddy
fox
in
his
politest
manner
i
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
it
is
all
because
i
had
a
terrible
fright
last
night
is
that
so
what
was
it
asked
peter
ducking
down
behind
a
big
bramble
bush
to
hide
his
smile
why
i
went
over
to
farmer
brown
garden
to
see
if
that
new
planting
of
young
cabbage
was
all
right
and
there
i
met
a
terrible
monster
it
frightened
me
so
that
i
did
not
dare
to
come
out
this
morning
until
jolly
round
sun
had
begun
to
climb
up
in
the
sky
and
so
i
am
a
little
late
are
you
ready
peter
rabbit
to
go
up
to
the
new
planting
of
young
cabbage
with
me
asked
reddy
in
his
pleasantest
manner
now
what
do
you
think
peter
rabbit
did
why
peter
just
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
and
laughed
and
shouted
he
lay
down
on
his
back
and
kicked
his
heels
for
very
joy
but
all
the
time
he
took
care
to
keep
behind
a
big
friendly
bramble
bush
reddy
fox
stared
at
peter
rabbit
he
just
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
began
to
think
that
peter
had
gone
crazy
he
could
see
a
thing
to
laugh
at
yet
here
was
peter
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
finally
peter
stopped
and
sat
up
did
did
the
monster
catch
you
reddy
fox
he
asked
wiping
his
eyes
no
replied
reddy
it
did
catch
me
because
i
could
run
faster
than
it
could
but
it
chased
me
all
the
way
home
in
that
case
i
think
i
not
go
up
to
the
cabbage
bed
this
morning
for
you
know
i
can
not
run
as
fast
as
you
can
reddy
and
the
monster
might
catch
me
replied
peter
very
gravely
besides
he
added
i
have
had
my
fill
of
tender
young
cabbage
and
it
was
very
nice
indeed
what
shouted
reddy
fox
yes
continued
peter
rabbit
i
just
could
wait
till
morning
so
i
went
up
there
early
last
night
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
of
it
reddy
fox
i
am
indeed
for
just
a
little
minute
an
ugly
look
crept
into
reddy
face
for
now
he
knew
that
once
more
peter
rabbit
had
fooled
him
but
he
kept
his
temper
and
managed
to
smile
as
he
said
oh
do
mention
it
peter
rabbit
do
mention
it
but
tell
me
did
you
meet
the
monster
no
replied
peter
rabbit
and
then
do
what
he
would
he
could
keep
sober
another
minute
but
began
to
laugh
just
as
he
had
before
what
the
joke
peter
rabbit
tell
me
so
that
i
can
laugh
too
begged
reddy
fox
why
said
peter
rabbit
when
he
could
get
his
breath
the
joke
is
that
the
monster
that
frightened
you
so
was
the
old
straw
hat
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
i
was
underneath
it
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
then
reddy
fox
knew
just
how
badly
peter
rabbit
had
fooled
him
with
a
snarl
he
sprang
right
over
the
bramble
bush
at
peter
rabbit
but
peter
was
watching
and
darted
away
along
one
of
his
own
special
little
paths
through
the
old
reddy
tried
to
follow
but
the
brambles
tore
his
clothes
and
scratched
his
face
and
stuck
in
his
feet
finally
he
had
to
give
it
up
tom
and
bleeding
and
angry
he
tinned
back
home
and
as
he
left
the
old
he
could
still
hear
peter
rabbit
laughing
xi
shadow
the
weasel
gets
lost
the
green
meadows
had
heard
how
peter
rabbit
had
frightened
reddy
fox
with
an
old
straw
hat
and
everywhere
that
reddy
went
some
one
was
sure
to
shout
after
him
reddy
fox
is
fine
to
see
he
as
brave
as
brave
can
be
he
meets
an
old
straw
hat
then
he
do
know
where
he
at
then
reddy
would
lose
his
temper
and
chase
his
tormentors
most
of
all
he
wanted
to
catch
peter
rabbit
he
lay
in
wait
for
peter
in
fence
corners
and
behind
bushes
and
trees
but
somehow
peter
seemed
always
to
know
that
reddy
was
there
in
the
old
peter
was
safe
reddy
had
tried
to
follow
him
there
but
he
had
found
that
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
peter
paths
were
so
narrow
and
the
brambles
tore
reddy
clothes
and
scratched
him
so
that
he
had
to
give
it
up
reddy
was
thinking
of
this
one
day
as
he
sat
on
his
scowling
over
at
the
old
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
shadow
the
weasel
shadow
is
so
slim
that
he
can
go
almost
anywhere
that
any
one
else
can
and
he
is
so
fierce
that
nearly
all
of
the
little
meadow
people
are
terribly
afraid
of
him
reddy
smiled
it
was
a
mean
wicked
crafty
smile
then
he
hopped
up
and
hurried
to
find
shadow
the
weasel
and
tell
him
his
plan
shadow
listened
and
then
he
too
began
to
smile
it
easy
reddy
fox
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
we
get
peter
rabbit
just
as
sure
as
fat
hens
are
good
eating
said
he
as
they
started
for
the
old
reddy
plan
was
very
simple
shadow
the
weasel
was
to
follow
peter
rabbit
along
peter
narrow
little
paths
and
drive
peter
out
of
the
old
on
to
the
green
meadows
where
reddy
fox
could
surely
catch
him
so
reddy
fox
sat
down
to
wait
while
shadow
started
into
the
old
peter
rabbit
heard
him
coming
and
of
course
peter
began
to
run
now
when
peter
first
made
his
home
in
the
old
he
had
foreseen
that
some
day
shadow
the
weasel
might
come
to
hunt
him
there
so
peter
had
made
dozens
and
dozens
of
little
paths
twisting
and
turning
and
crossing
and
recrossing
in
the
most
puzzling
way
of
course
peter
himself
knew
every
twist
and
turn
of
every
one
of
them
but
shadow
had
not
gone
very
far
before
he
was
all
mixed
up
he
kept
his
sharp
little
nose
to
the
ground
to
smell
peter
footsteps
but
peter
kept
crossing
his
own
tracks
so
often
that
pretty
soon
shadow
could
not
tell
which
path
peter
had
last
taken
peter
led
him
farther
and
farther
into
the
middle
of
the
old
right
there
shadow
came
to
a
great
big
puddle
of
water
peter
had
jumped
clear
across
it
for
you
know
peter
legs
are
long
and
meant
for
jumping
now
shadow
hates
to
get
his
feet
wet
and
when
he
reached
the
puddle
he
stopped
he
glared
with
fierce
little
red
eyes
across
at
peter
rabbit
sitting
on
the
other
side
then
he
started
around
the
edge
peter
waited
until
shadow
was
almost
around
and
then
he
jumped
back
across
the
puddle
there
was
nothing
for
shadow
to
do
but
go
back
around
which
he
did
of
course
peter
just
did
the
same
thing
over
again
all
the
time
in
his
sleeve
for
shadow
the
weasel
was
growing
angrier
and
angrier
finally
he
grew
so
angry
that
he
tried
to
jump
the
puddle
himself
and
in
he
fell
with
a
great
splash
when
shadow
crawled
out
wet
and
muddy
peter
had
disappeared
and
shadow
could
tell
which
path
he
had
taken
worse
still
he
know
which
path
to
take
to
get
out
himself
he
tried
one
after
another
but
after
a
little
while
he
would
find
himself
back
at
the
puddle
in
the
middle
of
the
old
shadow
the
weasel
was
lost
yes
sir
shadow
the
weasel
was
lost
in
the
old
outside
reddy
fox
waited
and
watched
but
no
frightened
peter
rabbit
came
jumping
out
as
he
expected
what
could
it
mean
after
a
long
long
time
he
saw
some
one
very
muddy
and
very
wet
and
very
tired
crawl
out
of
one
of
peter
rabbit
little
paths
it
was
shadow
the
weasel
reddy
took
one
good
look
at
him
and
then
he
hurried
away
he
did
want
to
hear
what
shadow
the
weasel
would
say
and
as
he
hurried
across
the
green
meadows
he
heard
peter
rabbit
voice
from
the
middle
of
the
old
if
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
again
shouted
peter
rabbit
reddy
fox
ground
his
teeth
xii
the
plot
of
two
scamps
jay
looking
around
for
mischief
found
reddy
fox
sitting
on
his
with
his
chin
in
both
hands
and
looking
as
if
he
had
a
friend
in
the
world
what
are
you
doing
asked
sammy
jay
i
just
replied
reddy
fox
what
are
you
studying
perhaps
i
can
help
you
said
sammy
jay
reddy
fox
heaved
a
long
sigh
i
how
i
can
catch
peter
rabbit
replied
reddy
sammy
jay
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
reddy
fox
still
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
sammy
jay
sat
on
one
foot
and
scratched
and
scratched
and
scratched
his
head
with
the
other
suddenly
sammy
looked
up
i
have
it
said
he
you
remember
the
hollow
log
over
beyond
the
old
reddy
nodded
his
head
well
i
go
down
and
invite
peter
rabbit
to
come
over
there
and
see
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
you
know
what
great
curiosity
peter
rabbit
has
now
you
be
hiding
in
the
hollow
log
and
when
you
hear
me
say
to
peter
rabbit
strangest
thing
in
the
world
is
waiting
for
you
over
there
peter
you
spring
out
and
you
have
peter
reddy
fox
brightened
up
this
plan
certainly
did
look
good
to
reddy
peter
had
fooled
him
so
many
times
that
he
was
almost
in
despair
he
knew
that
if
he
sent
another
invitation
to
peter
peter
would
suspect
right
away
that
it
meant
mischief
but
peter
would
think
that
sammy
jay
was
planning
mischief
because
he
knew
that
sammy
is
the
greatest
news
teller
in
the
green
forest
so
reddy
fox
trotted
off
to
the
hollow
log
down
by
the
big
and
crept
inside
sammy
jay
flew
over
to
the
old
to
look
for
peter
rabbit
he
found
him
sitting
under
a
big
bramble
bush
good
morning
peter
rabbit
said
sammy
jay
with
his
finest
manner
peter
looked
at
sammy
sharply
as
he
returned
his
greeting
sammy
jay
was
in
the
habit
of
being
so
polite
to
peter
and
peter
began
to
study
just
what
it
could
mean
i
saw
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
this
morning
said
sammy
jay
peter
pricked
up
his
ears
in
spite
of
himself
he
began
to
grow
curious
what
was
it
sammy
jay
he
asked
sammy
looked
very
mysterious
i
really
do
know
what
it
is
he
replied
but
i
can
show
it
to
you
if
you
want
to
see
for
yourself
peter
rabbit
of
course
peter
wanted
to
see
it
so
he
started
out
across
the
green
meadows
with
sammy
jay
now
the
farther
he
went
the
more
time
he
had
to
think
and
by
the
time
he
had
nearly
reached
the
old
peter
began
to
suspect
a
trick
sammy
jay
motioned
peter
to
approach
very
carefully
it
right
over
there
in
that
hollow
log
peter
he
whispered
you
go
peep
in
and
you
see
it
then
sammy
prepared
to
give
the
signal
to
reddy
fox
peter
hopped
a
couple
of
steps
nearer
and
then
he
sat
up
very
straight
and
gazed
at
the
hollow
log
somehow
he
did
just
like
the
looks
of
it
he
did
know
why
but
he
just
did
then
along
came
one
of
old
mother
west
wind
merry
little
breezes
dancing
right
past
the
hollow
log
and
up
to
peter
rabbit
and
with
him
he
brought
a
funny
smell
peter
little
wobbly
nose
wrinkled
that
funny
smell
certainly
reminded
peter
of
reddy
fox
he
wrinkled
his
nose
again
then
he
suddenly
whirled
about
excuse
me
sammy
jay
he
exclaimed
i
just
remember
something
very
important
and
before
sammy
jay
could
open
his
mouth
peter
had
started
like
a
little
brown
streak
for
the
old
xiii
reddy
fox
comes
to
life
fox
lay
on
the
side
hill
bobby
coon
found
him
there
and
when
bobby
spoke
to
him
reddy
made
no
reply
bobby
went
over
and
looked
at
him
reddy
eyes
were
closed
bobby
grinned
to
himself
then
he
a
little
nearer
and
shouted
boo
right
in
one
of
little
black
ears
still
reddy
did
not
move
bobby
coon
face
grew
sober
he
poked
reddy
with
his
foot
but
still
reddy
did
not
move
then
he
pulled
reddy
tail
and
still
reddy
did
not
move
it
must
be
that
reddy
fox
is
dead
thought
bobby
coon
and
he
hurried
away
to
tell
the
news
illustration
there
was
great
excitement
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
when
the
little
people
there
heard
that
reddy
fox
was
dead
of
course
every
one
wanted
to
see
reddy
and
soon
there
was
a
procession
of
little
meadow
and
forest
people
hurrying
across
the
green

to

all
were
there
they
formed
a
big
circle
around
reddy
fox
then
they
began
to
talk
about
reddy
some
told
of
the
good
things
that
reddy
had
done
and
what
a
fine
gentleman
he
was
others
told
of
the
mean
things
that
reddy
fox
had
done
and
how
glad
they
were
that
they
would
no
longer
have
to
watch
out
for
him
it
was
surprising
the
number
of
bad
things
that
were
said
but
then
they
felt
safe
in
saying
them
for
was
not
reddy
lying
right
there
before
them
stone
dead
now
peter
rabbit
had
not
heard
the
news
until
late
in
the
day
and
when
he
did
hear
it
he
started
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
to
have
a
last
look
at
reddy
half
way
there
he
suddenly
stopped
and
scratched
one
of
his
long
ears
peter
was
thinking
it
was
mighty
funny
that
reddy
fox
should
have
died
without
any
one
having
heard
that
he
was
sick
peter
started
on
again
but
this
time
he
did
not
hurry
presently
he
cut
a
long
twig
which
he
carried
along
with
him
when
he
reached
the
circle
around
reddy
fox
he
stole
up
behind
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
and
whispered
in
his
ear
prickly
porky
took
the
long
twig
which
peter
handed
to
him
while
peter
went
off
at
a
little
distance
and
climbed
up
on
an
old
stump
where
he
could
see
prickly
porky
reached
over
and
tickled
one
of
reddy
black
ears
for
a
minute
nothing
happened
then
the
black
ear
twitched
prickly
porky
tickled
the
end
of
reddy
little
black
nose
then
he
tickled
it
again
what
do
you
think
happened
why
reddy
fox
sneezed
my
my
my
how
that
circle
around
reddy
fox
did
disappear
all
the
little
people
who
were
afraid
of
reddy
fox
scampered
away
as
fast
as
they
could
run
while
all
the
other
little
people
who
were
not
afraid
of
reddy
fox
began
to
laugh
and
the
one
who
laughed
loudest
of
all
was
peter
rabbit
as
he
started
back
to
the
old
of
course
reddy
fox
knew
then
that
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
to
pretend
that
he
was
dead
so
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
after
peter
rabbit
at
the
top
of
his
speed
but
when
he
reached
the
old
peter
was
safely
inside
and
reddy
could
hear
him
laughing
as
if
he
would
split
his
sides
if
at
first
you
do
succeed

peter

for
days
and
days
reddy
fox
had
been
trying
to
catch
peter
and
peter
had
had
to
keep
his
wits
very
sharp
indeed
in
order
to
keep
out
of
reddy
way
still
it
did
seem
to
worry
peter
much
just
now
he
was
hopping
and
skipping
down
the
lone
little
path
without
a
care
in
the
world
presently
peter
found
a
nice
shady
spot
close
by
a
big
rock
underneath
one
edge
of
the
rock
was
a
place
just
big
enough
for
peter
to
crawl
in
it
was
just
the
place
for
a
nap
peter
was
beginning
to
feel
sleepy
so
he
crawled
in
there
and
soon
was
fast
asleep
by
and
by
peter
began
to
dream
he
dreamed
that
he
had
gone
for
a
long
walk
way
way
off
from
the
safe
old
and
that
out
from
behind
a
big
bush
had
sprung
reddy
fox
just
as
reddy
teeth
were
about
to
close
on
peter
peter
woke
up
it
was
such
a
relief
to
find
that
he
was
really
snug
and
safe
under
the
big
rock
that
he
almost
shouted
aloud
but
he
did
and
a
minute
later
he
was
oh
so
glad
he
had
for
he
heard
a
voice
that
seemed
as
if
it
was
right
in
his
ear
it
was
the
voice
of
reddy
fox
yes
sir
it
was
the
voice
of
reddy
fox
peter
hardly
dared
to
breathe
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
did
not
make
even
the
smallest
sound
for
reddy
fox
was
sitting
on
the
very
rock
under
which
peter
was
resting
reddy
fox
was
talking
to
blacky
the
crow
peter
listened
with
all
his
might
for
what
do
you
think
reddy
fox
was
saying
why
he
was
telling
blacky
the
crow
of
a
new
plan
to
catch
peter
rabbit
and
was
asking
blacky
to
help
him
peter
had
never
been
so
frightened
in
his
life
for
here
was
reddy
fox
so
close
to
him
that
peter
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
one
of
reddy
legs
as
he
kicked
his
heels
over
the
edge
of
the
big
rock
by
and
by
blacky
the
crow
spoke
i
saw
peter
rabbit
coming
down
this
way
early
this
morning
said
blacky
and
i
do
think
he
has
gone
home
why
do
you
go
over
and
hide
near
the
old
and
catch
peter
when
he
comes
back
i
will
watch
out
and
if
i
see
peter
i
will
tell
him
that
you
have
gone
hunting
your
breakfast
way
over
beyond
the
big
hill
then
he
will
not
be
on
the
watch
the
very
thing
exclaimed
reddy
fox
and
if
i
catch
him
i
will
surely
do
something
for
you
blacky
i
believe
that
i
will
go
right
away
then
the
two
rascals
planned
and
chuckled
as
they
thought
how
they
would
outwit
peter
rabbit
i
getting
hungry
said
reddy
fox
as
he
arose
and
stretched
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
field
mouse
hiding
under
this
old
rock
i
believe
i
look
and
see
peter
heart
almost
stood
still
as
he
heard
reddy
fox
slide
down
off
the
big
rock
he
wriggled
himself
still
further
under
the
rock
and
held
his
breath
just
then
blacky
the
crow
gave
a
sharp
caw
caw
caw
that
meant
that
blacky
saw
something
and
almost
at
once
peter
heard
a
sound
that
sometimes
filled
his
heart
with
fear
but
which
now
filled
it
with
great
joy
it
was
the
voice
of
bowser
the
hound
reddy
fox
heard
it
too
and
he
did
stop
to
look
under
the
big
rock
a
little
later
peter
very
cautiously
crawled
out
of
his
resting
place
and
climbed
up
where
he
could
look
over
the
green
meadows
way
over
on
the
far
side
he
could
see
reddy
fox
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
behind
him
was
bowser
the
hound
my
but
that
was
a
tight
place
said
peter
rabbit
as
he
stretched
himself
xv
johnny
chuck
helps
peter
chuck
had
watched
reddy
fox
try
to
fool
and
catch
peter
rabbit
and
sometimes
johnny
had
been
very
much
afraid
that
reddy
would
succeed
but
peter
had
been
too
smart
for
reddy
every
time
and
johnny
had
laughed
with
the
other
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
whenever
the
merry
little
breezes
had
brought
a
new
story
of
how
peter
had
outwitted
reddy
peter
have
to
watch
out
sharper
than
ever
now
for
granny
fox
is
almost
well
and
she
is
very
angry
because
reddy
could
not
catch
peter
rabbit
for
her
when
she
was
she
says
that
she
is
going
to
show
that
stupid
reddy
how
to
do
it
and
do
it
quickly
said
jimmy
skunk
when
he
stopped
to
chat
with
johnny
chuck
one
fine
morning
johnny
had
just
been
laughing
very
hard
over
one
of
peter
tricks
but
now
his
face
grew
very
sober
very
sober
indeed
it
do
to
let
old
granny
fox
catch
peter
it
wo
do
at
all
we
must
all
turn
in
and
help
peter
said
johnny
why
what
would
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
be
like
with
no
peter
rabbit
he
added
late
that
afternoon
johnny
chuck
happened
to
find
peter
rabbit
taking
a
nap
yes
sir
peter
had
actually
gone
to
sleep
outside
the
dear
old
at
first
johnny
thought
that
he
would
waken
him
and
tell
him
that
reddy
fox
was
hunting
right
near
but
just
then
bright
eyes
saw
something
that
made
him
chuckle
it
was
the
home
of
some
friends
of
his
a
beautiful
home
made
of
what
looked
like
gray
paper
it
was
fastened
to
a
bush
just
above
a
little
path
leading
to
the
very
spot
where
peter
lay
fast
asleep
johnny
chuckled
again
then
off
he
hurried
he
sat
down
on
top
of
a
little
hill
pretty
soon
reddy
fox
came
along
through
the
hollow
below
hello
reddy
fox
do
you
want
to
know
how
you
can
catch
peter
rabbit
asked
johnny
reddy
looked
up
he
did
know
just
what
to
say
he
knew
that
johnny
chuck
and
peter
had
always
been
the
very
best
of
friends
still
friends
fall
out
sometimes
and
perhaps
johnny
and
peter
had
reddy
decided
that
he
would
be
polite
i
certainly
do
johnny
chuck
he
replied
can
you
tell
me
how
to
do
it
yes
said
johnny
peter
is
fast
asleep
over
yonder
behind
that
little
bunch
of
huckleberry
bushes
there
is
a
little
path
through
them
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
hurry
up
that
little
path
as
fast
and
as
still
as
you
can
reddy
fox
waited
to
hear
no
more
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
started
off
at
the
top
of
his
speed
up
the
little
path
just
as
johnny
had
expected
reddy
went
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
did
use
his
eyes
for
anything
but
signs
of
peter
rabbit
bang
reddy
had
run
head
first
into
the
paper
house
of
johnny
friends
in
fact
he
had
smashed
the
whole
side
in
out
poured
old
hornet
and
all
her
family
and
they
had
their
little
needles
with
them
reddy
forgot
all
about
peter
rabbit
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
and
started
for
home
slapping
at
old
hornet
whom
he
never
could
hit
and
stopping
every
few
minutes
to
roll
over
and
over
of
course
when
he
yelled
peter
rabbit
awoke
and
sat
up
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
he
saw
reddy
running
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
over
on
the
little
hill
he
saw
johnny
chuck
laughing
so
that
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
then
peter
began
to
laugh
too
and
ran
over
to
ask
johnny
chuck
to
tell
him
all
about
it
xvi
reddy
fox
tells
a
wrong
story
fox
was
a
sight
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
when
he
started
down
on
to
the
green
meadows
that
morning
he
limped
like
an
old
old
man
yes
indeed
reddy
was
a
sorry
looking
sight
his
head
was
swelled
so
that
one
eye
was
closed
and
he
could
hardly
see
out
of
the
other
reddy
never
would
have
ventured
out
but
that
he
just
had
to
have
some
fresh
mud
from
the
smiling
pool
reddy
had
waited
until
most
of
the
little
meadow
people
were
out
of
the
way
then
he
had
tried
to
hurry
so
as
to
get
back
again
as
quickly
as
possible
but
johnny
chuck
sharp
eyes
had
spied
reddy
and
johnny
had
guessed
right
away
what
the
trouble
was
he
hurried
over
to
tell
peter
rabbit
then
the
two
little
scalawags
hunted
up
jimmy
skunk
and
bobby
coon
to
tell
them
and
the
four
hid
near
the
lone
little
path
to
wait
for
reddy
return
pretty
soon
reddy
came
limping
along
even
johnny
chuck
was
surprised
at
the
way
reddy
face
had
swelled
it
was
plastered
all
over
with
mud
and
he
was
a
sorry
sight
indeed
bobby
coon
appeared
very
much
astonished
to
see
reddy
in
such
condition
though
of
course
johnny
chuck
had
told
him
all
about
how
reddy
had
run
head
first
into
the
home
of
old
hornet
and
her
family
the
day
before
bobby
stepped
out
in
the
lone
little
path
why
reddy
fox
what
has
happened
to
you
he
exclaimed
reddy
did
see
the
others
hiding
in
the
long
grass
he
did
want
bobby
coon
to
know
that
he
had
been
so
careless
as
to
run
his
head
into
a
hornets
nest
so
he
told
a
wrong
story
he
put
on
a
long
face
that
is
it
was
as
long
as
he
could
make
it
considering
that
it
was
so
swelled
i
had
a
most
terrible
accident
bobby
coon
said
reddy
sighing
pitifully
it
happened
yesterday
as
i
was
returning
from
an
errand
over
beyond
the
hill
just
as
i
was
coming
through
the
deepest
part
of
the
wood
i
heard
some
one
crying
of
course
i
stopped
to
find
out
what
the
matter
was
of
course
interrupted
bobby
coon
certainly
to
be
sure
of
course
reddy
looked
at
him
suspiciously
but
went
on
with
his
tale
right
down
in
the
thickest
blackest
place
i
found
one
of
unc
billy
children
being
worried
to
death
by
digger
the
badger
i
could
see
that
little
possum
hurt
of
course
not
broke
in
bobby
coon
so
i
jumped
in
and
tackled
old
man
badger
and
i
had
him
almost
whipped
when
i
slipped
over
the
edge
of
a
big
rock
on
the
side
of
the
hill
it
took
the
skin
off
my
face
and
bruised
me
something
terrible
but
i
do
care
so
long
as
i
saved
that
little
possum
child
concluded
reddy
as
he
started
on
johnny
chuck
stole
up
behind
him
and
thrust
a
sharp
brier
into
the
seat
of
reddy
pants
at
the
same
time
johnny
made
a
noise
like
a
whole
family
of
hornets
reddy
fox
forgot
his
limp
he
never
even
turned
his
head
to
look
behind
instead
he
started
off
at
his
best
speed
and
it
was
until
he
heard
a
roar
of
laughter
behind
him
that
he
realized
that
he
had
been
fooled
again
xvii
reddy
almost
gets
peter
rabbit
fox
really
was
almost
ill
from
the
effects
of
the
stings
which
old
hornet
and
her
family
had
given
him
when
he
knocked
in
the
side
of
their
house
for
several
days
he
limped
around
his
head
badly
swollen
yes
sir
reddy
fox
was
in
a
dreadful
bad
way
the
worst
of
it
was
that
none
of
the
other
little
meadow
and
forest
people
seemed
to
be
the
least
bit
sorry
for
him
some
of
them
actually
laughed
at
him
peter
rabbit
did
reddy
fox
had
made
life
very
uncomfortable
for
peter
for
a
long
time
and
now
peter
was
actually
enjoying
reddy
discomfort
now
while
he
was
laid
up
this
way
reddy
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
he
noticed
that
when
he
went
out
to
walk
all
those
who
kept
at
a
safe
distance
when
he
was
well
now
hardly
got
out
of
his
way
they
knew
that
he
felt
too
sore
and
mean
to
try
to
catch
them
peter
rabbit
hardly
turned
out
of
his
path
a
bright
idea
came
to
reddy
he
would
continue
to
appear
to
feel
badly
even
after
he
was
well
he
would
keep
his
head
bound
up
and
would
limp
down
to
the
smiling
pool
for
some
mud
every
day
then
when
peter
rabbit
came
near
enough
reddy
would
catch
him
so
day
after
day
reddy
limped
down
to
the
smiling
pool
he
kept
his
head
tied
up
as
if
it
was
as
bad
as
ever
and
as
he
walked
he
groaned
as
if
in
great
pain
even
some
of
those
who
hated
him
most
began
to
feel
a
little
bit
sorry
for
reddy
fox
peter
has
a
very
soft
heart
and
although
he
knew
that
reddy
fox
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
gobble
him
up
he
began
to
feel
sorry
for
reddy
one
morning
peter
sat
just
outside
the
old
when
reddy
came
limping
along
he
looked
more
miserable
than
usual
just
as
it
had
been
for
several
days
one
of
reddy
eyes
was
closed
it
must
be
hard
work
to
see
with
only
one
eye
said
peter
rabbit
it
is
replied
reddy
with
a
great
sigh
it
is
very
hard
work
indeed
i
do
see
how
you
manage
to
get
enough
to
eat
continued
peter
in
his
most
sympathetic
voice
reddy
sighed
again
i
do
peter
rabbit
i
do
get
enough
to
eat
and
i
nearly
starved
this
very
minute
when
he
said
this
such
a
note
of
longing
crept
into
his
voice
that
peter
instantly
grew
suspicious
while
he
was
sorry
for
reddy
he
had
no
desire
to
make
reddy
feel
better
by
furnishing
himself
for
a
meal
peter
hopped
around
to
the
blind
side
of
reddy
and
turned
his
back
to
him
as
he
inquired
for
the
health
of
old
granny
fox
now
you
know
that
peter
eyes
are
so
placed
in
his
head
that
he
can
see
behind
him
without
turning
his
head
reddy
fox
did
not
know
this
or
if
he
did
he
had
forgotten
it
very
slowly
and
craftily
the
closed
eye
opened
a
wee
bit
and
in
that
line
of
yellow
was
a
hungry
look
peter
rabbit
saw
it
and
with
a
great
jump
landed
behind
a
friendly
bramble
bush
in
the
old
ha
ha
shouted
peter
i
rather
talk
with
you
reddy
fox
when
you
have
got
a
closed
eye
with
such
a
hungry
look
in
it
ta
ta
reddy
fox
just
shook
his
fist
at
peter
rabbit
and
started
off
home
pulling
the
bandage
from
his
head
as
he
went
xviii
johnny
chuck
prepares
for
winter
was
something
in
the
air
that
peter
rabbit
could
understand
it
made
him
feel
frisky
and
happy
and
ready
to
run
a
race
or
have
a
frolic
with
any
one
who
might
happen
along
he
could
understand
why
it
did
make
all
his
friends
and
neighbors
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
feel
the
same
way
but
it
did
no
sir
it
did
some
of
those
with
whom
he
best
liked
to
play
would
play
at
all
not
even
for
a
few
minutes
said
they
had
time
peter
was
puzzling
over
it
as
he
scampered
down
the
lone
little
path
kicking
his
heels
and
trying
to
jump
over
his
own
shadow
just
ahead
of
him
sitting
on
his
own
sat
johnny
chuck
my
goodness
how
fat
johnny
chuck
is
getting
thought
peter
rabbit
then
he
shouted
come
on
and
play
hide
and
seek
johnny
chuck
but
johnny
chuck
shook
his
head
ca
said
he
i
got
to
get
ready
for
winter
peter
rabbit
sat
down
and
looked
at
johnny
chuck
curiously
he
understand
why
anybody
should
take
the
trouble
to
get
ready
for
winter
he
did
excepting
that
he
put
on
a
warmer
coat
so
he
imagine
why
johnny
chuck
should
have
to
get
ready
for
winter
how
do
you
do
it
he
asked
do
what
johnny
chuck
looked
up
in
surprise
why
get
ready
for
winter
of
course
peter
replied
just
a
wee
bit
impatiently
johnny
chuck
looked
at
peter
as
if
he
thought
peter
very
stupid
indeed
why
i
eat
of
course
said
he
shortly
and
began
to
stuff
himself
as
if
he
had
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
week
when
all
the
time
he
was
so
fat
and
that
he
could
hardly
waddle
peter
eyes
twinkled
i
should
think
you
did
he
exclaimed
i
would
mind
getting
ready
for
winter
that
way
myself
you
know
peter
thinks
a
very
great
deal
of
his
stomach
then
he
added
i
should
think
you
were
trying
to
eat
enough
to
last
you
all
winter
johnny
chuck
yawned
sleepily
and
then
once
more
began
to
eat
i
am
he
said
briefly
talking
with
his
mouth
full
what
that
cried
peter
rabbit
his
big
eyes
popping
out
i
said
i
trying
to
eat
enough
to
last
me
all
winter
that
the
way
i
get
ready
for
winter
replied
johnny
chuck
just
a
wee
bit
crossly
i
think
i
got
enough
now
he
added
how
cool
it
is
getting
i
think
i
go
down
and
go
to
sleep
i
see
you
in
the
spring
peter
rabbit
wha
what
that
exclaimed
peter
rabbit
looking
as
if
he
thought
he
had
heard
aright
but
johnny
chuck
had
disappeared
inside
his
house

rabbit
gets
another
surprise
rabbit
sat
on
johnny
chuck
for
five
long
minutes
scratching
his
head
first
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
now
what
did
johnny
chuck
mean
by
saying
that
he
would
see
me
in
the
spring
said
peter
rabbit
to
himself
here
it
is
winter
yet
and
it
will
be
a
long
long
time
before
spring
yet
johnny
chuck
spoke
just
as
if
he
did
expect
to
see
me
until
winter
has
passed
is
he
going
away
somewhere
if
he
is
why
wo
i
see
him
all
winter
just
as
i
have
all
summer
the
more
peter
thought
about
it
the
more
puzzled
he
became
at
last
he
had
a
happy
thought
i
just
run
down
to
the
smiling
pool
and
ask
grandfather
frog
he
is
very
old
and
very
wise
and
he
will
surely
know
what
johnny
chuck
meant
so
kicking
up
his
heels
peter
rabbit
started
down
the
lone
little
path
across
the
green
meadows
to
the
smiling
pool
there
he
found
grandfather
frog
sitting
as
usual
on
his
big
but
the
was
as
green
as
it
used
to
be
and
grandfather
frog
did
look
as
smart
as
usual
his
big
goggly
eyes
looked
heavy
and
dull
just
as
if
they
did
see
much
of
anything
at
all
grandfather
frog
nodded
sleepily
and
once
nearly
fell
off
the
big
good
morning
grandfather
frog
shouted
peter
rabbit
eh
what
said
grandfather
frog
blinking
his
eyes
and
putting
one
hand
behind
an
ear
as
if
he
was
hard
of
hearing
i
said
good
morning
grandfather
frog
shouted
peter
rabbit
a
little
louder
than
before
no
replied
grandfather
frog
grumpily
it
is
a
good
morning
too
chilly
he
shivered
as
he
spoke
peter
rabbit
pretended
not
to
notice
how
grumpy
grandfather
frog
was
in
his
most
polite
way
he
asked
can
you
tell
me
grandfather
frog
where
johnny
chuck
spends
the
winter
spends
it
at
home
of
course
do
bother
me
with
such
foolish
questions
snapped
grandfather
frog
but
if
he
is
going
to
spend
the
winter
at
home
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
that
he
would
see
me
in
the
spring
just
as
if
he
did
expect
to
see
me
before
then
persisted
peter
rabbit
grandfather
frog
yawned
shook
himself
yawned
again
and
said
johnny
chuck
probably
meant
just
what
he
said
and
i
think
i
follow
his
example
it
getting
too
cold
for
an
old
fellow
like
me
i
begin
to
feel
it
in
my
bones
i
getting
so
sleepy
that
i
guess
the
sooner
i
hunt
up
my
bed
in
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
smiling
pool
the
better
chugarum
johnny
chuck
is
wise
i
see
you
in
the
spring
peter
rabbit
and
tell
you
all
about
it
and
with
that
grandfather
frog
dived
with
a
great
splash
into
the
smiling
pool
xx
peter
tries
ol
mistah
buzzard
rabbit
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
and
stared
at
the
place
where
grandfather
frog
had
disappeared
with
a
great
splash
he
watched
the
tiny
waves
spread
out
in
rings
that
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
then
finally
disappeared
too
now
what
did
grandfather
frog
mean
when
he
said
i
see
you
in
the
spring
peter
rabbit
johnny
chuck
had
said
that
very
same
thing
as
he
had
gone
down
the
long
hall
of
his
snug
house
yet
it
would
be
a
long
long
time
before
spring
for
it
was
not
winter
yet
where
did
they
expect
to
be
all
winter
and
what
did
they
expect
to
do
the
more
peter
puzzled
over
it
the
less
he
could
understand
it
my
head
is
whirling
round
and
round
so
many
funny
things
i
found
folks
say
it
grows
too
cold
to
stay
yet
do
not
seem
to
go
away
they
talk
of
meeting
in
the
spring
but
do
explain
a
single
thing
they
just
go
into
their
houses
and
say
i
do
understand
it
at
all
at
all
said
peter
rabbit
staring
at
the
big
on
which
grandfather
frog
had
sat
all
summer
watching
for
foolish
green
flies
to
come
his
way
somehow
that
big
made
peter
rabbit
feel
terribly
lonely
then
he
had
a
happy
thought
i
just
run
over
and
ask
ol
mistah
buzzard
what
it
all
means
he
be
sure
to
know
said
peter
rabbit
and
off
he
started
for
the
green
forest
when
peter
got
where
he
could
see
the
tall
dead
tree
that
ol
mistah
buzzard
had
made
his
favorite
he
could
see
ol
mistah
buzzard
stretching
his
big
wings
as
if
he
was
getting
ready
to
fly
peter
hurried
faster
he
did
want
mistah
buzzard
to
get
away
before
he
could
ask
him
what
johnny
chuck
and
grandfather
frog
had
meant
peter
could
shout
because
he
has
much
of
a
voice
you
know
and
then
he
was
out
of
breath
anyway
so
he
just
made
those
long
legs
of
his
go
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
which
is
very
fast
indeed
just
as
peter
rabbit
almost
reached
the
tall
dead
tree
ol
mistah
buzzard
jumped
off
the
branch
he
had
been
sitting
on
gave
two
or
three
flaps
with
his
great
wings
and
then
spreading
them
out
wide
began
to
sail
round
and
round
and
up
and
up
as
only
ol
mistah
buzzard
can
wait
wait
please
wait
panted
peter
rabbit
but
his
voice
was
so
weak
that
ol
mistah
buzzard
did
hear
him
he
saw
peter
however
but
of
course
he
did
know
that
peter
wanted
to
talk
with
him
with
a
long
swoop
ol
mistah
buzzard
sailed
off
right
over
peter
head
brer
rabbit
ah
see
yo
in
the
spring
said
ol
mistah
buzzard
and
before
peter
could
say
a
word
he
was
out
of
hearing
up
in
the
sky
peter
watched
him
go
up
and
up
until
he
was
just
a
speck
in
the
blue
blue
sky
now
what
did
he
mean
by
that
is
he
going
to
stay
up
in
the
sky
until
spring
asked
peter
rabbit
of
himself
but
not
knowing
of
course
he
could
answer
xi
happy
jack
squirrel
is
to
busy
to
talk
rabbit
sat
with
his
mouth
wide
open
staring
up
into
the
blue
blue
sky
where
ol
mistah
buzzard
was
growing
smaller
and
smaller
finally
he
was
just
a
teeny
weeny
speck
and
then
peter
could
see
him
at
all
peter
hitched
up
his
trousers
and
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
very
thoughtful
he
was
troubled
in
his
mind
was
peter
rabbit
first
johnny
chuck
had
said
i
see
you
in
the
spring
and
had
disappeared
underground
then
grandfather
frog
had
said
i
see
you
in
the
spring
and
had
disappeared
in
the
smiling
pool
now
ol
mistah
buzzard
had
said
ah
see
yo
in
the
spring
and
had
disappeared
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
and
they
all
spoke
just
as
if
they
meant
it
said
peter
to
himself
i
believe
i
go
over
and
see
happy
jack
squirrel
perhaps
he
can
tell
me
what
it
all
means
so
off
started
peter
rabbit
through
the
green
forest
looking
for
happy
jack
squirrel
pretty
soon
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
happy
jack
gray
coat
hi
happy
jack
called
peter
hurrying
as
fast
as
he
could
hello
peter
rabbit
do
bother
me
this
morning
i
got
too
much
to
do
to
be
bothered
said
happy
jack
digging
a
little
hole
in
the
ground
while
he
talked
peter
grew
curious
at
once
so
curious
that
he
forgot
all
about
what
he
was
going
to
ask
happy
jack
he
sat
down
and
watched
happy
jack
put
a
nut
in
the
hole
and
cover
it
up
then
happy
jack
hurried
to
dig
another
hole
and
do
the
same
thing
over
again
what
are
you
doing
that
for
asked
peter
rabbit
doing
it
for
why
i
getting
ready
for
winter
of
course
stupid
said
happy
jack
as
he
paused
for
breath
but
i
thought
you
stored
your
nuts
and
corn
in
a
hollow
tree
exclaimed
peter
rabbit
so
i
do
replied
happy
jack
but
i
would
be
foolish
to
put
all
my
supplies
in
one
place
so
i
bury
some
of
them
but
how
do
you
remember
where
you
bury
them
persisted
peter
i
do
always
but
when
i
forget
my
nose
helps
me
out
then
i
just
dig
down
and
get
them
said
happy
jack
now
i
ca
stop
to
talk
any
more
for
i
am
late
this
year
and
the
first
thing
i
know
winter
will
be
here
then
peter
remembered
what
he
had
come
for
oh
happy
jack
what
did
johnny
chuck
and
grandfather
frog
and
ol
mistah
buzzard
mean
by
saying
that
they
would
see
me
in
the
spring
he
cried
ca
stop
to
tell
you
now
replied
happy
jack
running
this
way
and
that
way
and
pulling
over
the
fallen
leaves
to
hunt
for
another
nut
winter
coming
and
i
got
to
be
ready
for
it
ca
stop
to
talk
and
that
was
all
peter
rabbit
could
get
out
of
him
although
he
followed
happy
jack
about
and
bothered
him
with
questions
until
happy
jack
quite
lost
his
temper
peter
sighed
he
saw
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
and
striped
chipmunk
both
quite
as
busy
as
happy
jack
it
of
no
use
to
ask
them
for
they
are
doing
the
same
thing
that
happy
jack
is
thought
peter
i
do
see
the
use
of
all
this
fuss
about
winter
anyway
i
do
have
to
get
ready
for
it
i
believe
go
down
to
the
smiling
pool
again
and
see
if
maybe
grandfather
frog
has
come
up
xxii
unc
billy
possum
explains
things
rabbit
had
sat
still
all
day
long
in
his
safe
in
the
middle
of
the
dear
old
jolly
round
red
sun
had
gone
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
had
raced
out
across
the
green
meadows
and
into
the
green
forest
now
the
moonlight
was
driving
them
back
a
little
way
peter
hopped
out
of
the
old
into
the
moonlight
and
stretched
first
one
leg
and
then
another
then
he
jumped
up
and
down
three
or
four
times
to
get
the
kinks
out
of
his
long
hind
legs
and
finally
started
off
up
the
lone
little
path
half
way
up
the
lone
little
path
peter
almost
ran
headlong
into
billy
possum
mah
goodness
brer
rabbit
done
give
me
a
powerful
start
exclaimed
unc
billy
what
in
such
a
right
smart
hurry
fo
peter
rabbit
grinned
as
he
stopped
running
i
did
mean
to
frighten
you
uncle
billy
the
fact
is
i
was
on
my
way
up
to
your
house
to
see
how
you
and
old
possum
and
all
the
children
do
this
fine
fall
weather
said
peter
rabbit
unc
billy
possum
looked
at
peter
rabbit
sharply
seems
to
me
that
have
taken
a
powerful
sudden
interest
in
ah
remember
seeing
yo
up
our
way
fo
a
long
time
brer
rabbit
said
he
peter
looked
a
little
foolish
for
it
was
true
that
he
had
been
near
unc
billy
hollow
tree
for
a
long
time
you
see
i
been
very
busy
getting
ready
for
winter
said
peter
by
way
of
an
excuse
unc
billy
began
to
chuckle
and
then
to
laugh
he
rested
both
hands
on
his
knees
and
laughed
and
laughed
peter
rabbit
could
see
anything
to
laugh
at
and
he
began
to
get
just
a
wee
bit
provoked
what
the
joke
he
demanded
the
very
idea
of
brer
rabbit
getting
ready
for
winter
or
of
being
busy
about
anything
but
other
people
affairs
cried
unc
billy
wiping
his
eyes
peter
tried
to
feel
and
to
look
very
angry
but
he
could
no
sir
he
could
the
very
twinkle
in
unc
billy
possum
eyes
made
peter
want
to
laugh
too
in
fact
peter
just
had
to
laugh
finally
both
stopped
laughing
and
peter
told
unc
billy
all
about
the
things
that
had
troubled
him
johnny
chuck
disappeared
down
in
his
house
and
said
he
would
see

in
the
spring

did
he
mean
by
that
asked
peter

looked
as
if
they
would
pop
right
out
of
his
head
and

what
has
become
of
him
he
asked

unc

blue
blue

and
ah

added
billy
suddenly
growing
sober
then
peter
rabbit
had
a
sudden
thought

to
sleep
all

uncle
billy
he
asked
anxiously
the
grin
came
back
to
unc

face
no

replied
billy
xxiii
peter
rabbit
has
a
bright
idea
rabbit
had
a
bright
idea
at
least
peter
thought
it
was
and
he
chuckled
over
it
a
great
deal
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
better
it
seemed
what
was
it
why
to
follow
the
plan
of
johnny
chuck
and
grandfather
frog
to
avoid
the
cold
stormy
weather
by
sleeping
all
winter
yes
sir
that
was
peter
rabbit
bright
idea
if
johnny
chuck
can
sleep
and
sleep
the
whole
long
stormy
winter
through
it
ought
to
be
it
seems
to
me
the
very
thing
for
me
to
do
peter
rabbit
said
this
to
himself
as
he
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
old
chewing
the
end
of
a
straw
if
johnny
chuck
could
do
it
of
course
he
could
do
it
all
he
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
find
a
snug
warm
house
which
nobody
else
was
using
fix
himself
a
comfortable
bed
curl
up
and
go
to
sleep
peter
tried
to
picture
himself
sleeping
away
while
the
snow
lay
deep
all
over
the
green
meadows
and
the
smiling
pool
could
smile
no
more
because
the
ice
the
hard
black
ice
would
not
let
it
finally
peter
could
sit
still
no
longer
he
just
had
to
tell
some
one
about
his
bright
idea
and
and
well
he
was
quite
sure
of
just
the
way
to
go
to
sleep
and
sleep
so
long
for
never
in
his
life
had
peter
rabbit
slept
more
than
a
very
very
short
time
without
waking
to
see
that
no
danger
was
near
i
just
run
up
and
see
uncle
billy
possum
said
peter
unc
billy
possum
was
sitting
in
his
doorway
in
his
big
hollow
tree
in
the
green
forest
when
peter
rabbit
came
hurrying
up
peter
hardly
waited
to
say
good
morning
before
he
began
to
tell
unc
billy
all
about
his
bright
idea
unc
billy
listened
gravely
although
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
the
first
thing
yo
must
do
is
to
find
a
warm
place
to
sleep
brer
rabbit
said
unc
billy
illustration
oh
that
easy
enough
said
peter
and
then
yo
must
get
fat
brer
rabbit
continued
unc
billy
what
that
exclaimed
peter
rabbit
looking
very
much
puzzled
ah

yo
must
get
fat
repeated
unc
billy
slapping
his
own
fat
sides
what
for
asked
peter
to
keep
yo
warm
while
yo
are
asleep
replied
unc
billy
must
i
get
very
fat
peter
asked
yes
sah
yo
must
get
very
fat

said
unc
billy
and
smiled
for
it
was
hard
to
think
of
peter
rabbit
as
very
fat
how
how
can
i
get
fat
asked
peter
and
looked
just
a
little
bit
worried
by
eating
and
eating
and
eating
and
between
times
sitting
still
replied
unc

peter
who
you
know
thinks
a
great
deal
of
his
stomach
is
that
all

said
unc
billy
and
grinned
when
peter
happened
to
turn
his
head
peter
thanked
unc
billy
and
hurried
back
to
the
old
to
think
over
all
that
unc
billy
had
told
him
i
certainly
will
try
it
said
peter
xxiv
peter
prepares
for
a
long
sleep
after
day
peter
rabbit
ran
about
this
way
and
that
over
the
green
meadows
and
through
the
green
forest
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
jimmy
skunk
noticed
it
so
did
billy
mink
and
bobby
coon
but
peter
would
stop
to
explain
indeed
he
was
always
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
would
stop
at
all
but
when
he
met
them
would
shout
hello
over
his
shoulder
and
keep
right
on
running
unc
possum
was
the
only
one
who
guessed
what
it
meant
unc
billy
grinned
as
he
watched
peter
running
about
with
such
a
serious
and
important
air
brer
rabbit
is
trying
dreadful
hard
to
fool
hisself
ah
reckon
he
looking
fo
a
place
to
curl
up
and
try
to
sleep
all
winter
said
unc
billy
unc
billy
had
guessed
just
right
peter
was
looking
for
a
place
to
curl
up
to
sleep
all
winter
peter
was
too
lazy
to
dig
a
new
house
for
himself
then
it
was
too
late
in
the
fall
anyway
he
would
just
find
some
old
deserted
house
that
some
of
jimmy
skunk
relatives
or
johnny
chuck
relations
had
given
up
using
so
peter
went
poking
into
every
old
house
he
knew
of
trying
to
find
one
that
was
so
that
it
would
do
at
last
he
found
one
that
he
thought
would
be
just
the
place
and
peter
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
planned
how
he
would
curl
up
in
the
bedchamber
way
down
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
nobody
ever
guess
where
i
am
he
said
to
himself
and
laughed
aloud
then
peter
remembered
that
unc
billy
possum
had
told
him
that
it
was
necessary
to
eat
a
great
deal
so
as
to
be
very
fat
before
going
to
sleep
for
that
was
the
way
to
keep
warm
all
winter
so
peter
started
out
to
grow
fat
this
would
be
fun
the
very
best
kind
of
fun
for
there
is
nothing
peter
rabbit
loves
more
than
to
fill
his
stomach
unless
it
is
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
peter
rabbit
stomach
is
a
thing
that
most
amazing
it
takes
so
long
to
fill
it
up
his
time
is
short
for
lazing
perhaps
this
is
the
reason
why
when
peter
is
eating
he
wants
to
loaf
around
and
watch
other
people
work
anyway
peter
is
a
tremendous
eater
and
now
that
he
wanted
to
grow
fat
he
felt
that
he
must
eat
more
than
ever
so
he
began
at
once
to
eat
and
eat
and
eat
but
there
was
one
very
important
thing
that
peter
had
forgotten
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
it
was
now
late
in
the
fall
and
the
tender
young
green
things
which
peter
dearly
loves
to
eat
were
gone
he
could
no
longer
go
down
to
the
sweet
clover
patch
and
fill
himself
full
to
bursting
farmer
brown
had
taken
away
all
the
cabbages
and
carrots
and
turnips
that
had
made
his
garden
so
attractive
to
peter
so
now
peter
had
to
hunt
for
what
he
had
to
eat
that
made
a
great
deal
of
running
about
and
it
is
very
hard
work
to
grow
fat
when
one
runs
about
the
more
peter
ate
the
more
he
had
to
hunt
for
his
food
and
the
more
he
had
to
hunt
for
his
food
the
more
he
had
to
run
about
and
the
more
he
had
to
run
about
the
more
he
hurried
and
the
faster
he
ran
now
of
course
running
takes
fat
off
oh
dear
cried
peter
rabbit
getting
fat
is
not
as
easy
as
i
thought
xxv
unc
billy
possum
plays
a
joke
some
folks
never
seem
to
be
satisfied
or
quite
content
always
wanting
something
more
that
fo
them
was
never
meant
billy
possum
said
this
to
himself
as
he
watched
peter
rabbit
hurrying
about
through
the
green
forest
and
over
the
green
meadows
eating
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
so
as
to
grow
fat
that
he
might
keep
warm
while
he
slept
all
winter
now
unc
billy
possum
knew
perfectly
well
that
peter
rabbit
could
sleep
all
winter
as
johnny
chuck
does
for
old
mother
nature
had
never
planned
that
peter
should
but
billy
knew
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
tell
peter
that
for
peter
believe
him
so
he
chuckled
as
he
watched
peter
rush
around
hunting
for
food
and
actually
running
off
what
little
fat
he
did
have
instead
of
putting
on
more
of
course
it
just
happened
that
unc
billy
possum
was
right
over
near
the
old
house
built
by
grandfather
skunk
a
long
time
ago
which
peter
rabbit
had
decided
to
sleep
in
all
winter
it
just
happened
that
he
saw
peter
when
he
finally
went
down
to
the
little
bedchamber
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
to
curl
up
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
unc
billy
grinned
then
he
chuckled
finally
he
laughed
until
his
fat
sides
shook
ah
reckon
ah
gwine
to
have
some
fun
with
brer
rabbit
said
billy
still
chuckling
as
he
trotted
off
through
the
green
forest
he
went
over
to
bobby
coon
house
and
found
bobby
who
had
been
out
all
night
just
getting
ready
for
bed
but
bobby
is
always
ready
to
play
a
joke
and
when
unc
billy
told
him
about
peter
rabbit
and
what
fun
it
would
be
to
give
peter
a
scare
bobby
scrambled
down
from
his
hollow
tree
right
away
then
they
hunted
up
jimmy
skunk
and
the
three
started
for
the
old
house
of
grandfather
skunk
where
peter
rabbit
was
trying
to
go
to
sleep
for
the
winter
ah
done
tell
peter
that
when
he
tried
to
go
to
sleep
he
must
get
to
thinking
about
what
would
happen
if
brer
fox
should
jes
happen
along
and
find
him
asleep
ah
reckons
that
that
is
the
very
first
thing
peter
did
think
of
as
soon
as
he
curled
himself
up
and
that
he
thinking
of
it
ever
right
this
blessed
minute
wait
while
ah
listen
at
the
door
unc
billy
stole
very
softly
to
the
door
of
the
old
house
then
he
began
to
grin
and
beckoned
to
bobby
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
to
come
listen
they
could
hear
long
sighs
from
way
down
in
the
bedchamber
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
they
heard
peter
twist
and
turn
as
he
tried
to
make
himself
comfortable
but
when
they
heard
him
saying
a
verse
over
and
over
to
try
to
make
himself
go
to
sleep
they
had
to
clap
their
hands
over
their
mouths
to
keep
from
laughing
out
loud
when
they
grew
tired
of
listening
unc
billy
whispered
to
jimmy
skunk
jimmy
skunk
grinned
and
then
he
crept
a
little
way
down
the
long
hall
and
began
to
scratch
with
his
stout
claws
as
if
he
were
digging
when
he
stopped
unc
billy
put
his
mouth
down
close
to
the
doorway
and
barked
as
nearly
like
reddy
fox
as
he
could
then
jimmy
began
to
dig
again
and
pretty
soon
unc
billy
barked
again
then
all
three
stole
softly
away
and
hid
behind
some
bushes
ah
reckon
brer
rabbit
is
right
smart
instead
of
going
to
sleep
fo
the
winter
chuckled
unc
billy
xxvi
peter
rabbit
learns
his
lesson
rabbit
curled
up
in
the
little
bedchamber
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
in
the
old
house
made
a
long
time
ago
by
grandfather
skunk
twisted
and
turned
and
tried
to
make
himself
feel
sleepy
but
the
harder
he
tried
the
more
he
seemed
to
feel
then
he
began
to
think
of
reddy
and
granny
fox
and
what
would
happen
if
by
any
chance
they
should
find
him
there
fast
asleep
and
right
while
he
was
thinking
about
it
he
heard
a
noise
that
made
him
jump
so
that
he
bumped
his
head
peter
did
think
anything
about
the
bump
on
his
head
no
sir
peter
did
even
notice
it
he
was
too
frightened
he
held
his
breath
and
listened
while
his
heart
went
there
it
was
again
that
noise
he
had
heard
before
some
one
was
in
the
long
dark
hall
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
could
hear
claws
scratching
whoever
it
was
was
digging
digging
the
very
thought
made
every
hair
on
peter
rabbit
stand
on
end
he
knew
that
johnny
chuck
had
gone
to
sleep
for
the
winter
he
knew
that
jimmy
skunk
could
walk
right
in
without
any
trouble
and
that
jimmy
never
takes
any
trouble
that
he
can
avoid
he
knew
that
bobby
coon
and
unc
billy
possum
do
go
into
houses
underground
unless
they
have
to
to
get
away
from
danger
and
very
seldom
then
if
some
one
was
digging
in
the
long
dark
hall
it
could
mean
but
one
thing
that
it
must
be
some
one
too
big
to
get
in
without
making
the
hall
larger
and
the
only
ones
he
could
think
of
were
bowser
the
hound
and
reddy
and
granny
fox
peter
shivered
and
shook
for
unlike
johnny
chuck
house
this
one
had
no
back
door
if
it
bowser
the
hound
he
may
get
tired
and
go
away
anyway
i
can
soon
tell
for
he
will
sniff
and
snuff
and
blow
the
sand
out
of
his
nose
thought
peter
and
strained
his
ears
to
hear
the
first
sniff
but
there
were
no
sniffs
or
snuffs
instead
peter
heard
a
sound
that
made
his
heart
almost
stop
beating
again
it
was
a
bark
a
bark
that
sounded
very
much
like
the
bark
of
reddy
fox
and
it
came
from
just
outside
the
door
that
could
mean
but
one
thing
that
old
granny
fox
was
digging
her
way
in
to
the
little
bedchamber
while
reddy
kept
watch
outside
oh
dear
oh
dear
why
was
i
content
to
live
as
i
always
have
lived
whatever
did
i
try
to
do
something
i
never
was
intended
to
do
for
cried
peter
to
himself
and
shook
with
fright
harder
than
ever
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
still
and
wait
peter
sat
as
still
as
ever
he
could
after
a
little
while
the
noise
in
the
long
dark
hall
stopped
peter
waited
and
waited
but
all
was
still
and
he
began
to
feel
better
perhaps
old
granny
fox
did
know
that
he
was
there
at
all
and
had
grown
tired
of
digging
and
had
gone
away
peter
waited
a
long
time
and
then
peeped
out
into
the
long
hall
way
up
at
the
end
he
could
see
light
where
the
doorway
was
and
by
this
he
knew
that
no
one
was
in
the
hall
little
by
little
his
heart
going
peter
crept
up
until
he
could
peep
outside
no
one
was
to
be
seen
with
his
heart
almost
in
his
mouth
peter
sprang
out
and
started
for
the
dear
old
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
and
then
he
heard
a
sound
that
made
him
stop
suddenly
and
sit
up
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
hoi
hee
hee
hee
there
behind
some
bushes
unc
billy
possum
bobby
coon
and
jimmy
skunk
were
laughing
fit
to
kill
themselves
then
peter
knew
that
they
had
played
a
joke
on
him
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
them
but
down
in
his
heart
he
was
glad
for
he
knew
that
he
had
learned
his
lesson
that
he
had
no
business
to
try
to
do
what
old
mother
nature
had
never
intended
that
he
should
do
of
course
these
are
not
all
of
peter
rabbit
adventures
oh
my
no
but
there
are
so
many
other
little
people
who
live
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
who
have
adventures
too
and
get
into
funny
scrapes
that
i
am
sure
you
will
be
willing
to
say
good
night
to
peter
for
a
little
while
and
hear
about
the
things
that
have
happened
to
some
of
the
others

book

am
going
to
tell
you
about

worries
and
troubles
and
exciting
escapes
