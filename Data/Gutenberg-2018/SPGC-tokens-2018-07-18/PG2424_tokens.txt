black

prologue
the
frenchman
beside
me
had
been
dead
since
dawn
his
scarred
and
shackled
body
swayed
limply
back
and
forth
with
every
sweep
of
the
great
oar
as
we
his
less
fortunate
tugged
and
strained
to
keep
time
to
the
stroke
two
men
had
i
seen
die
beside
me
yet
death
ever
passed
me
by
nay
it
seemed
rather
that
despite
the
pain
of
stripes
despite
the
travail
and
hardship
my
strength
waxed
the
mightier
upon
arm
and
thigh
burnt
nigh
black
by
fierce
suns
the
muscles
showed
hard
and
knotted
within
my
body
scarred
by
the
lash
the
life
leapt
and
glowed
yet
was
the
soul
of
me
sick
unto
death
but
it
seemed
i
could
not
die
finding
thereby
blessed
rest
and
a
surcease
from
this
agony
of
life
as
had
this
frenchman
who
of
all
the
naked
wretches
about
me
was
the
only
one
with
whom
i
had
any
sort
of
fellowship
he
had
died
as
i
say
with
the
dawn
so
quietly
that
at
first
i
thought
he
but
fainted
and
pitied
him
but
when
i
knew
pity
changed
to
bitterness
therefore
as
i
strove
at
the
heavy
oar
i
prayed
gnashing
teeth
a
prayer
i
had
often
prayed
and
the
matter
of
my
praying
was
thus
o
god
of
justice
for
the
agony
i
needs
must
now
endure
for
the
bloody
stripes
and
bitter
anguish
give
to
me
vengeance
vengeance
o
god
on
mine
enemy
so
prayed
i
and
with
the
sweat
trickling
down
whiles
i
stared
at
the
naked
back
of
him
that
rowed
before
me
a
great
fat
fellow
he
had
been
once
but
now
the
skin
hung
in
numberless
creases
whereon
were
many
weals
some
raw
and
bloody
that
crossed
and
each
other
after
the
manner
of
justice
o
god
upon
mine
enemy
since
death
is
not
for
me
let
me
live
until
i
be
avenged
for
the
pain
i
suffer
so
may
i
see
him
suffer
for
the
anguish
that
is
mine
so
may
i
watch
his
agony
thou
art
a
just
god
so
god
of
justice
give
to
me
vengeance
the
sun
rose
high
and
higher
over
our
quarter
beating
down
upon
our
naked
backs
and
adding
greatly
to
our
torments
thereby
waking
the
pain
of
old
stripes
and
lending
an
added
sting
to
new
ever
and
anon
would
come
the
sharp
crack
of
the
drivers
whips
followed
by
the
squealing
cry
of
quivering
flesh
a
cry
wherein
was
none
of
the
human
the
which
dying
to
a
whine
was
lost
in
the
stir
and
bustle
of
the
great
galleass
but
ever
and
always
beneath
the
hoarse
voices
of
the
mariners
beneath
the
clash
of
armour
and
tramp
of
feet
beneath
the
creak
and
rumble
of
the
long
oars
came
yet
another
sound
rising
and
falling
yet
never
ceasing
a
dull
low
sound
the
like
of
which
you
shall
sometimes
hear
among
trees
when
the
wind
is
high
the
deep
sobbing
moan
that
was
the
voice
of
our
anguish
as
we
poor
wretches
urged
the
great
esmeralda
galleass
upon
her
course
the
oar
whereto
i
was
chained
along
with
my
three
had
at
some
time
been
badly
sprung
so
that
the
armourers
had
made
shift
to
strengthen
it
with
a
stout
iron
fillet
some
six
inches
wide
now
it
so
happened
that
my
grasp
came
upon
this
fillet
and
with
every
stroke
of
the
oar
day
after
day
week
in
and
week
out
it
had
become
my
wont
to
rub
the
links
of
my
chain
to
and
fro
across
this
iron
band
whereby
they
had
become
very
smooth
and
shining
the
words
of
my
prayer
were
yet
upon
my
lips
when
chancing
to
look
upon
one
of
these
links
i
beheld
that
which
set
my
heart
and
my
riotous
blood
to
my
fingers
ends
yet
was
a
very
small
thing
no
more
than
a
mark
that
showed
upon
the
polished
surface
of
the
link
a
line
not
so
thick
as
a
hair
and
not
to
be
noticed
without
close
looking
but
when
i
bore
upon
the
link
this
grew
and
widened
it
needed
but
a
sudden
wrench
and
i
should
be
free
this
threw
me
into
such
a
rapturous
transport
that
i
had
much
ado
to
contain
myself
howbeit
after
some
while
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
the
heaven
all
flushed
and
rosy
with
the
young
day
for
it
seemed
that
god
had
indeed
heard
my
prayer
presently
along
the
gangway
amidships
comes
none
other
than
that
accursed
portugal
pedro
the
who
espying
the
drooping
form
of
the
frenchman
beside
me
forthwith
falls
in
his
vile
tongue
and
gives
a
prodigious
flourish
with
his
whip
now
by
reason
of
much
practice
they
do
become
very
expert
with
these
same
whips
insomuch
that
they
shall
with
a
certain
cunning
flick
of
the
lash
gash
you
a
man
as
it
were
with
a
knife
the
like
of
which
none
may
bear
and
not
cry
out
for
the
exceeding
pain
of
it
ha
thou
lazy
dog
cries
he
think
ye
to
snore
and
take
your
ease
whiles
pedro
is
aboard
and
with
the
word
the
long
lash
hissed
and
cracked
upon
the
frenchman
naked
back
like
a
and
lo
he
that
meseemed
was
dead
stirred
i
felt
the
scarred
body
leap
and
quiver
the
swooning
eyes
opened
rolling
dim
and
sightless
and
the
pallid
face
was
twisted
in
sharp
anguish
but
even
as
i
watched
the
lines
of
agony
were
smoothed
away
into
the
wild
eyes
came
a
wondrous
light
and
uttering
a
great
glad
cry
he
sank
forward
across
the
and
hung
there
hereupon
this
accursed
pedro
betook
him
to
his
whip
smiting
right
heartily
but
seeing
the
frenchman
stirred
not
and
perceiving
moreover
the
blood
to
come
but
slow
and
in
no
great
quantity
he
presently
desisted
and
bade
us
cease
rowing
one
and
all
this
sudden
respite
from
labour
served
but
to
teach
me
how
stiff
and
painful
were
my
limbs
more
especially
my
left
wrist
and
ankle
where
the
fetters
had
worn
great
sores
the
wind
was
fallen
light
and
there
rose
that
hot
sickening
reek
that
suffocating
stench
that
is
like
unto
nothing
on
earth
save
one
of
these
floating
hells
and
the
which
if
a
man
hath
but
smelled
it
once
he
shall
nevermore
forget
after
some
while
back
cometh
pedro
with
certain
of
the
armourers
and
having
by
divers
methods
learned
the
frenchman
was
in
sooth
dead
they
struck
off
his
fetters
hand
and
leg
in
the
doing
of
which
they
must
needs
free
me
also
since
we
were
chained
together
he
and
i
and
binding
a
great
shot
to
his
feet
made
ready
to
heave
him
overboard
and
now
seeing
no
man
heeded
me
i
snapped
asunder
the
cracked
link
and
was
free
save
for
the
heavy
chain
that
cumbered
my
leg
stooping
i
lifted
this
chain
and
crouched
to
spring
for
the
bulwark
but
now
even
in
this
moment
remembering
all
that
i
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
this
most
accursed
pedro
i
turned
and
wrapping
the
broken
about
my
fist
crept
towards
where
he
stood
to
oversee
the
armourers
his
back
was
towards
me
and
i
was
within
a
yard
of
him
when
he
turned
and
seeing
me
uttered
a
shout
and
raised
his
whip
but
ere
the
blow
could
fall
i
leapt
and
smote
him
my
fist
took
him
full
betwixt
the
eyes
and
looking
down
upon
his
crushed
and
spattered
face
as
he
lay
i
knew
that
pedro
the
would
whip
men
no
more
these
many
days
then
not
minded
to
die
by
the
whip
or
upon
a
turned
i
and
sprang
for
the
ship
side
but
the
chain
about
my
leg
hampered
me
sorely
and
ere
i
could
mount
the
high
bulwark
i
was
beset
from
behind
so
would
i
have
faced
them
and
died
fighting
but
fierce
strokes
battered
me
to
my
knees
fierce
hands
wrenched
and
tore
at
me
and
grown
faint
with
blows
i
was
overborne
my
hands
lashed
behind
me
and
thus
helpless
i
was
dragged
along
the
gangway
and
so
up
the
ladder
to
the
poop
where
plain
to
all
men
sight
a
had
been
set
up
yet
even
so
i
struggled
still
panting
out
curses
on
them
french
and
spanish
and
english
drawing
upon
all
the
vile
abuse
of
the
and
lazarette
since
fain
would
i
have
them
slay
me
out
of
hand
the
rather
than
endure
the
miseries
and
anguish
of
my
lot
yet
this
might
not
be
since
slaves
were
hard
to
come
by
and
i
was
mighty
and
strong
wherefore
i
struggled
no
more
but
suffered
them
to
strike
off
my
broken
fetters
and
bind
me
to
the
as
they
listed
yet
scarce
had
they
made
an
end
when
there
comes
a
loud
hail
from
the
masthead
whereupon
was
sudden
mighty
of
men
running
hither
and
yon
laughing
and
shouting
one
to
another
some
buckling
on
armour
as
they
ran
some
casting
loose
the
great
ordnance
while
eyes
turned
and
hands
pointed
in
the
one
direction
but
turn
and
twist
me
how
i
might
i
could
see
nought
of
any
strange
sail
by
reason
of
the
high
bulkhead
beside
me
of
a
sudden
all
voices
were
hushed
as
up
the
comes
the
commander
don
miguel
in
his
black
armour
who
looking
long
and
steadily
to
windward
gives
a
sign
with
his
gauntleted
hand
whereon
divers
of
the
officers
go
off
some
to
muster
the
long
files
of
arquebusiers
others
to
overlook
the
setting
of
more
sail
and
the
like
and
now
was
a
prodigious
cracking
of
whips
followed
by
groans
and
cries
and
screaming
curses
and
straightway
the
long
oars
began
to
swing
with
a
swifter
beat
from
where
i
stood
in
my
bonds
i
could
look
down
upon
the
poor
naked
wretches
as
they
rose
and
fell
each
and
all
at
the
same
moment
in
time
to
the
stroke
for
maybe
half
an
hour
the
chase
was
kept
up
and
then
all
at
once
the
decks
quivered
the
discharge
of
one
of
the
forward
culverins
and
presently
as
the
great
galleass
altered
her
course
obedient
to
the
motion
of
don
miguel
hand
i
beheld
some
to
windward
the
towering
stern
of
the
ship
we
were
pursuing
whose
length
gradually
grew
upon
me
as
we
overhauled
her
until
she
was
fairly
in
view
she
was
a
small
ship
and
by
her
build
i
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
was
english
even
as
i
watched
up
to
her
fluttered
the
english
flag
and
hereupon
a
great
yearning
came
upon
me
insomuch
that
of
a
sudden
her
high
weatherbeaten
sides
her
towering
masts
and
patched
canvas
grew
all
blurred
and
indistinct
thrice
already
our
guns
had
roared
yet
though
she
was
now
so
close
that
i
made
out
her
very
rope
and
spar
she
made
no
sign
in
a
little
our
guns
fell
silent
also
wherefore
looking
about
i
beheld
don
miguel
standing
beside
the
tiller
yet
with
his
impassive
gaze
ever
bent
upon
the
foe
and
as
i
watched
i
read
his
deadly
purpose
and
a
great
fear
for
the
english
ship
came
upon
me
and
i
fell
beneath
my
breath
for
we
carried
a
weapon
more
terrible
than
any
culverin
that
was
ever
cast
the
long
sharp
ram
below
the
water
the
english
ship
was
now
so
near
that
i
could
see
the
yawning
muzzles
of
her
guns
while
her
high
curving
sides
seemed
to
tower
over
us
as
i
gazed
with
my
heart
full
of
a
pitiful
fear
for
her
i
saw
a
head
appear
above
her
a
very
round
head
whereon
was
a
mariner
red
cap
came
a
puff
of
smoke
the
sharp
crack
of
a
caliver
and
one
of
the
officers
beside
don
miguel
threw
up
his
hands
and
twisting
on
his
heels
fell
clashing
in
his
armour
when
i
looked
again
for
the
red
cap
it
was
gone
but
don
miguel
waited
silent
and
impassive
as
ever
suddenly
he
gestured
with
his
hand
i
saw
the
heave
of
the
steersmen
shoulders
as
they
obeyed
while
the
air
rang
with
shouts
of
command
as
the
starboard
oars
holding
water
the
larboard
thrashed
and
churned
amain
and
the
great
esmeralda
galleass
turning
thus
in
her
own
length
drove
straight
for
the
side
of
her
foe
never
had
i
seen
it
better
done
and
i
set
my
teeth
waiting
for
the
grinding
crash
that
was
to
send
the
english
ship
to
the
bottom
but
lo
her
creaking
yards
were
braced
round
and
paying
off
before
the
wind
which
now
blew
strongly
she
stood
away
upon
a
course
at
right
angles
to
her
old
whereby
both
vessels
were
running
parallel
as
before
yet
it
had
been
close
so
very
close
indeed
that
as
we
drove
past
her
i
heard
the
sickening
crack
of
our
oars
as
they
snapped
off
one
after
the
other
against
her
side
tossing
those
that
manned
them
in
bloody
struggling
heaps
and
now
from
every
english
gun
leaped
roaring
flame
the
air
was
full
of
shrieks
and
groans
and
the
crash
of
splintering
wood
and
through
the
eddying
smoke
i
could
see
many
of
our
soldiery
that
lay
in
strange
contorted
attitudes
while
others
crawled
sobbing
on
hands
and
knees
but
on
the
i
dared
not
look
hotter
waxed
the
fight
louder
swelled
the
din
and
tumult
with
the
thunder
of
the
guns
and
amid
it
all
don
miguel
paced
to
and
fro
impassive
as
always
the
blade
of
his
long
rapier
gleaming
here
and
there
as
he
directed
the
fire
up
rolled
the
smoke
thicker
and
denser
but
ever
and
anon
through
some
rift
i
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
scarred
blackened
side
of
the
english
ship
or
the
litter
and
confusion
of
our
decks
twice
shots
ploughed
up
the
planking
hard
by
me
and
once
my
post
itself
was
struck
so
that
for
a
moment
i
had
some
hope
of
winning
free
of
my
bonds
yet
struggle
how
i
would
i
could
not
move
the
which
filled
me
with
a
keen
despair
for
i
made
no
doubt
what
with
the
smoke
and
tumult
i
might
have
plunged
overboard
unnoticed
and
belike
have
gained
the
english
ship
slowly
and
by
degrees
our
fire
slackened
one
by
one
the
guns
fell
silent
and
in
their
place
rose
the
more
hateful
sounds
of
anguish
now
as
i
stood
thus
my
eyes
smarting
with
burnt
powder
my
ears
yet
ringing
with
the
din
i
grew
aware
how
the
deck
sloped
in
strange
fashion
at
first
i
paid
small
heed
yet
with
every
minute
this
slope
became
steeper
and
with
this
certainty
came
the
knowledge
that
we
were
sinking
and
moreover
judging
by
the
angle
of
the
deck
sinking
by
the
stern
hereupon
impelled
by
that
lust
of
life
the
which
is
implanted
in
each
one
of
us
i
fell
to
a
wild
struggling
against
my
bonds
until
seeing
in
a
little
the
hopelessness
of
this
i
grew
resigned
to
despair
and
ceasing
my
passionate
efforts
looked
about
me
for
the
smoke
was
thinned
away
and
truly
an
evil
sight
was
this
great
galleass
with
its
decks
and
huddled
heaps
of
dead
its
litter
of
broken
spars
and
dismantled
guns
and
with
everywhere
great
gouts
and
pools
of
blood
while
below
and
beyond
were
the
shattered
cumbered
now
with
awful
red
heaps
silent
for
the
most
part
yet
some
there
were
who
screamed
high
and
shrill
save
for
myself
and
divers
of
the
dead
the
poop
lay
deserted
but
forward
such
of
the
soldiers
and
mariners
who
yet
lived
were
fighting
for
the
boats
and
all
was
riot
and
confusion
as
i
stared
about
me
thus
i
espied
don
miguel
lying
among
the
wreckage
of
a
dismantled
gun
his
face
was
towards
me
and
looked
as
i
had
seen
it
an
hundred
times
save
for
a
smear
of
blood
upon
his
cheek
even
as
i
gazed
his
eyes
met
mine
full
and
square
for
a
moment
he
lay
without
motion
then
his
face
with
the
effort
he
came
slowly
to
his
elbow
gazed
about
him
and
so
back
to
me
again
then
i
saw
his
hand
creep
down
to
the
dagger
at
his
hip
to
fumble
weakly
there
howbeit
at
the
third
essay
he
drew
the
blade
and
began
to
creep
towards
me
very
slowly
and
painfully
he
dragged
himself
along
and
once
i
heard
him
groan
but
he
stayed
not
till
he
was
come
within
striking
distance
yet
was
he
sore
wounded
and
so
weak
withal
that
he
was
fain
to
rest
him
awhile
and
ever
his
impassive
eyes
looked
up
into
mine
the
while
i
nerved
myself
to
meet
the
blow
unflinching
an
it
might
be
so
once
more
he
raised
himself
his
arm
lifted
slowly
the
dagger
gleamed
and
fell
its
keen
edge
severing
the
cords
that
bound
me
and
with
a
sudden
effort
i
broke
free
and
stood
staring
down
into
those
impassive
eyes
as
one
in
a
dream
then
lifting
a
feeble
hand
he
pointed
to
the
tattered
sails
of
the
english
ship
hard
by
and
so
resting
his
head
upon
his
arm
as
one
that
is
very
weary
he
sighed
and
with
the
sigh
i
think
the
life
passed
out
of
him
turning
i
was
upon
the
in
a
single
leap
and
without
a
glance
at
the
red
havoc
behind
me
i
plunged
over
and
down
the
sharp
sting
of
the
brine
struck
me
like
a
myriad
but
the
sweet
cool
of
the
waters
was
wondrous
grateful
to
my
body
as
coming
to
the
surface
i
struck
out
for
the
english
ship
though
sore
hampered
by
my
chain
presently
coming
beneath
her
lofty
stern
i
found
hanging
therefrom
a
tangle
of
ropes
and
cordage
whereby
i
contrived
to
clamber
aboard
and
so
beheld
a
man
in
a
red
seaman
bonnet
who
sat
upon
the
wreckage
of
one
of
the
quarter
guns
tying
up
a
in
his
arm
with
hand
and
teeth
perceiving
me
he
rolled
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
up
at
me
and
nodded
welcome
aboard
lad
says
he
having
knotted
the
bandage
to
his
liking
be
ye
one
as
can
understand
good
english
aye
says
i
nodding
why
then
bear
witness
as
i
be
a
patient
soul
and
marciful
be
witness
as
i
held
my
fire
so
long
as
any
marciful
soul
might
by
token
that
i
knew
what
a
broadside
can
do
among
crowded
having
rowed
aboard
one
o
they
spanish
hells
afore
now
so
i
held
my
fire
till
yon
devil
craft
came
nigh
cutting
me
asunder
and
marcy
hath
its
limits
timothy
spence
o
the
tiger
master
is
me
homeward
bound
for
the
port
of
london
and
by
this
fight
am
short
five
good
men
but
you
a
proper
big
go
to
the
you
shall
know
him
by
reason
that
he
lacketh
his
starboard
yere
ask
him
for
clothes
to
cover
thy
nakedness
lad
and
oho
there
goeth
yon
devil
craft
turning
as
he
spoke
i
saw
the
sharp
bows
of
the
esmeralda
lift
and
lift
high
and
higher
and
with
a
gurgling
roar
the
great
galleass
plunged
down
stern
foremost
burying
her
shame
and
misery
from
the
eyes
of
man
for
evermore
thus
then
i
sailed
with
master
timothy
spence
aboard
the
tiger
a
free
man
after
five
years
of
anguish
chapter
i
of
what
befell
on
pembury
hill
it
was
a
night
of
tempest
with
rain
and
wind
a
great
wild
wind
that
shouted
mightily
near
and
far
filling
the
world
with
halloo
while
ever
and
anon
thunder
crashed
and
lightning
flamed
athwart
the
muddy
road
that
wound
steeply
up
betwixt
grassy
banks
topped
by
swaying
trees
broken
twigs
whirling
down
the
wind
smote
me
in
the
dark
fallen
branches
reached
out
arms
that
grappled
me
unseen
but
i
held
on
steadfastly
since
every
stride
carried
me
nearer
to
vengeance
that
vengeance
for
the
which
i
prayed
and
lived
so
with
bared
head
lifted
exulting
to
the
tempest
and
grasping
the
stout
that
served
me
for
staff
i
climbed
the
long
ascent
of
pembury
hill
reaching
the
summit
at
last
i
must
needs
stay
awhile
to
catch
my
breath
and
shelter
me
as
well
as
i
might
the
weather
bank
for
upon
this
eminence
the
rain
lashed
and
the
wind
smote
me
with
a
fury
redoubled
and
now
as
i
stood
amid
that
howling
darkness
my
back
propped
by
the
bank
my
face
lifted
to
the
tempest
i
was
aware
of
a
strange
sound
very
shrill
and
fitful
that
reached
me
the
booming
a
sound
that
came
and
went
now
loud
and
clear
anon
faint
and
remote
and
i
wondered
what
it
might
be
then
the
rushing
dark
was
split
asunder
by
a
jagged
and
i
saw
stark
against
the
glare
rose
black
shaft
and
crossbeam
wherefrom
swung
a
creaking
shape
of
rusty
chains
and
iron
bands
that
held
together
something
shrivelled
and
black
and
wet
with
rain
a
grisly
thing
that
leapt
on
the
buffeting
wind
that
strove
and
jerked
as
it
would
fain
break
free
and
hurl
itself
down
upon
me
now
hearkening
to
the
dismal
creak
of
this
chained
thing
i
fell
to
meditation
this
awful
shape
thought
i
had
been
a
man
once
hale
and
strong
even
as
i
but
this
man
had
contravened
the
law
even
as
i
purposed
to
do
and
he
had
died
a
rogue
death
and
so
hung
rotting
in
his
chains
even
as
this
my
own
body
might
do
some
day
and
hearkening
to
the
shrill
wail
of
his
fetters
my
flesh
crept
with
loathing
and
i
shivered
but
the
fit
passed
and
in
my
vain
pride
i
smote
my
staff
into
the
mud
at
my
feet
and
vowed
within
myself
that
nought
should
baulk
me
of
my
just
vengeance
come
what
might
as
my
father
had
suffered
death
untimely
and
hard
so
should
die
the
enemy
of
my
race
for
the
anguish
he
had
made
me
endure
so
should
he
know
anguish
i
bethought
me
how
long
and
deadly
had
been
this
feud
of
ours
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
a
dark
record
of
bitter
wrongs
bitterly
avenged
to
hate
like
a
brandon
and
revenge
like
a
conisby
this
had
been
a
saying
in
our
south
country
upon
a
time
and
now
he
was
the
last
of
his
race
as
i
was
the
last
of
mine
and
i
had
come
back
out
of
hell
that
this
saying
might
be
fulfilled
soon
ha
yes
in
a
few
short
hours
the
feud
should
be
ended
once
and
for
all
and
the
house
of
conisby
avenged
to
the
uttermost
thinking
thus
i
heeded
no
more
the
raving
tempest
around
me
until
roused
by
the
plunge
and
rattle
of
the
i
raised
my
head
and
shaking
my
staff
up
at
that
black
and
shrivelled
thing
i
laughed
loud
and
fierce
and
even
as
i
did
so
there
leapt
a
great
blaze
of
crackling
flame
and
thereafter
a
that
seemed
to
shake
the
very
earth
and
smite
the
roaring
wind
to
awed
silence
and
in
this
silence
i
heard
a
whisper
o
mercy
of
god
somewhere
in
the
darkness
hard
by
a
woman
had
cried
instinctively
i
turned
thitherward
searching
the
night
vainly
until
the
lightning
flared
again
and
i
beheld
a
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
huddled
miserably
against
the
bank
of
the
road
and
as
darkness
came
i
spoke
woman
doth
the
gibbet
fright
you
or
i
if
is
the
gibbet
go
hence
if
is
i
rest
assured
who
are
you
said
a
breathless
voice
one
of
no
more
account
than
the
poor
thing
that
danceth
aloft
in
his
chains
and
for
you
as
harmless
and
now
she
was
beside
me
a
dark
shape
and
above
the
howling
tempest
her
voice
reached
me
in
passionate
pleading
sir
sir
will
you
aid
one
in
sore
danger
and
distress
yourself
i
questioned
nay
indeed
nay
she
panted
is
marjorie
my
poor
poor
brave
marjorie
they
stopped
my
coach
drunken
men
i
know
not
what
came
of
gregory
and
i
leapt
out
and
escaped
them
in
the
dark
but
marjorie
they
carried
her
off
there
is
a
light
down
the
lane
yonder
i
followed
and
saw
o
sir
you
will
save
marjorie
you
are
a
man
a
hand
was
upon
my
ragged
sleeve
a
hand
that
gripped
and
shook
at
me
in
desperate
supplication
you
will
save
her
from
from
worse
than
death
speak
speak
lead
on
quoth
i
answering
this
compelling
voice
the
griping
fingers
slipped
down
and
clasped
my
hand
in
the
dark
and
with
never
another
word
she
led
me
away
unseeing
and
unseen
until
we
came
where
we
were
more
sheltered
from
rain
and
wind
and
now
i
took
occasion
to
notice
that
the
hand
that
gripped
mine
so
masterfully
was
small
and
soft
so
that
what
with
this
and
her
voice
and
speech
i
judged
her
one
of
condition
but
my
curiosity
went
no
further
nor
did
i
question
her
for
in
my
world
was
no
place
for
women
so
she
led
me
on
at
haste
despite
the
dark
like
one
that
was
sure
of
her
whereabouts
until
i
suddenly
espied
a
dim
light
that
shone
out
from
the
open
lattice
of
what
i
judged
to
be
a
small
here
my
companion
halted
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
light
go
she
whispered
go
nay
first
take
this
and
she
thrust
a
small
pistol
into
my
hand
haste
she
panted
o
haste
and
i
do
pray
god
shield
and
bless
you
then
with
never
a
word
i
left
her
and
strode
towards
the
beam
of
light
being
come
nigh
the
casement
i
paused
to
cock
the
weapon
and
to
glance
at
the
priming
then
creeping
to
the
open
lattice
i
looked
into
the
room
three
men
scowled
at
each
other
across
a
table
fellows
scarred
and
with
clothes
that
smacked
of
the
sea
behind
them
in
a
corner
crouched
a
maid
comely
of
seeming
but
pallid
of
cheek
and
with
cloak
torn
by
rough
hands
and
as
she
crouched
her
wide
eyes
stared
at
the
that
one
of
the
men
was
shaking
vigorously
a
tall
hairy
fellow
this
with
great
rings
in
his
ears
thus
stood
he
rattling
the
dice
and
smiling
while
his
companions
cursed
him
hoarsely
with
a
twist
of
the
hand
the
hairy
man
made
his
throw
and
as
the
three
evil
heads
stooped
above
the
dice
i
clambered
through
the
window
levelled
pistol
in
one
hand
heavy
staff
in
the
other
what
d
set
quoth
i
the
three
sprang
apart
and
stared
at
me
quite
chapfallen
what
to
do
growled
one
first
your
lay
them
here
on
the
table
and
quick
the
word
one
after
another
they
drew
the
weapons
from
their
belts
and
one
by
one
i
tossed
them
through
the
window
what
quoth
one
a
lank
rogue
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
winking
the
other
how

o
mine

i
and

i
but
first
you
wi
the
rings
open
the
door
here
the
hairy
fellow
growled
an
oath
and
reached
for
an
empty
tankard
and
thereupon
got
the
end
of
my
staff
driven
shrewdly
into
his
midriff
so
that
he
sank
to
the
floor
and
lay
gasping
nay
now
shipmate
quoth
the
plump
man
in
wheedling
tone
but
round
eyes
snapping

lubberly
manners

open

door
says
i
heartily

he
his
eye
upon

cudgel
and
edging
to
the
door
drew
the
bolts
and
set
it
wide
woman
quoth
i
run
with
never
a
word
the
maid
sprang
erect
caught
her
torn
cloak
about
her
and
speeding
across
the
room
was
gone
whereupon
the
lank
fellow
sat
him
down
and
fell
viciously
in
spanish
and
english
the
plump
man
clicked
his
teeth
and
grinned
while
leaning
against
the
wall
clasped
his
belly
and
groaned
well
so
my
bully
roarer
and
what
now
demanded
the
plump
man
softly
why
now
says
i
was
share
and
share

but
she
off
slipped
her
moorings
d
see
my
good
lad
and
be
damned

all
my
heart
said
the
little
plump
man
smiling
but
with
the
devil
peeping
through
his
narrowed
lids
says
i
laying
a
groat
upon
the
table
there
my
all
come
turn
out

pockets
pockets
murmured
the
plump
man
lord

what
this

cheated
of

bit
of
daintiness
here
abner
wi
all
the
wind
knocked

and
now
here

for
thieving
and
robbing
three
poor
lorn
as
never
raised

agin
ye
shame
shipmate
od

your
bones
snarled
the
man
and
spat
towards
me
whereat
i
raised
my
staff
and
he
lifting
an
arm
took
the
blow
on
his
and
writhed
cursing
but
while
i
laughed
at
the
contortions
the
plump
man
sprang
marvellous
nimble
and
dashed
out
the
light
and
as
i
stepped
from
before
the
window
i
heard
the
lattice
go
with
a
crash
of
glass
followed
a
long
tense
moment
wherein
we
all
as
i
judge
held
our
breath
for
though
the
storm
yet
roared
beyond
the
shattered
casement
within
was
a
comparative
quiet
thus
as
i
stood
in
the
dark
listening
for
some
rustle
some
stealthy
creeping
step
to
guide
my
next
blow
i
thrust
away
my
pistol
and
changing
my
staff
to
my
right
hand
drew
forth
the
sailor
knife
i
carried
and
so
waited
mighty
eager
and
alert
but
heard
only
the
booming
of
the
wind
then
a
floorboard
creaked
faintly
to
my
left
and
turning
short
i
whirled
my
staff
felt
it
strike
home
and
heard
a
fierce
cry
and
the
uneven
tread
of
staggering
feet
fight
rogues
cried
i
here
meat
and
drink
to
me
fight
and
setting
my
back
to
the
wall
i
waited
for
their
rush
instead
i
heard
a
hoarse
whispering
lost
all
at
once
in
a
woman
shrill
scream
out
beyond
the
casement
and
thereafter
a
loud
voice
that
hailed
house
ho
house
ahoy
light
ho
show
a
glim
ye
drunken
dogs
and
here
followed
a
rush
of
roaring
drowned
in
a
scream
louder
wilder
than
before
then
while
this
distressful
cry
yet
thrilled
upon
the
air
pandemonium
broke
loose
about
me
shouts
cries
and
a
rush
and
trample
of
feet
the
table
went
over
with
a
crash
and
the
darkness
about
me
rained
blows
but
as
they
struck
random
and
fierce
so
struck
i
and
as
i
do
think
made
right
goodly
play
with
my
until
caught
by
a
chance
blow
i
staggered
tripped
and
falling
headlong
found
myself
rolling
upon
sodden
grass
outside
the
shattered
window
for
a
moment
i
lay
and
found
in
the
wind
and
rain
vasty
comfort
and
refreshment
then
in
the
pitchy
gloom
hard
by
i
heard
that
which
brought
me
to
my
feet
an
evil
scuffling
a
close
and
desperate
struggling
a
hoarse
laugh
and
a
woman
pitiful
pleading
and
sobbing
i
had
lost
my
staff
but
i
yet
grasped
my
knife
and
with
this
held
point
upwards
and
my
left
hand
outstretched
before
me
i
crept
forward
guided
by
these
sounds
my
fingers
came
upon
hair
a
woman
long
soft
tresses
and
i
remember
marvelling
at
the
silky
feel
of
them
from
these
my
hand
slipped
to
her
waist
and
found
there
an
arm
that
grasped
her
close
then
drawing
back
my
hand
i
smote
with
my
knife
well
beneath
this
arm
and
drove
in
the
stout
blade
twice
the
fellow
grunted
and
loosing
the
maid
leapt
full
at
me
but
i
met
him
with
clenched
fist
and
he
went
down
headlong
and
i
crouched
above
him
and
feeling
him
struggle
to
his
knees
kicked
him
back
into
the
mud
and
thereafter
leapt
on
him
with
both
feet
as
i
had
been
wont
to
do
when
fighting
my
in
some
lazarette
then
seeing
he
stirred
no
more
i
left
him
doubting
nothing
i
had
done
his
business
yet
as
i
went
i
felt
myself
shiver
for
though
i
had
been
compelled
to
fight
the
naked
wretches
who
had
been
my
i
had
killed
no
man
as
yet
thus
as
i
went
chancing
to
stumble
against
a
tree
i
leaned
there
awhile
and
now
remembering
those
two
blows
under
the
armpit
what
with
this
stabbing
and
my
fall
and
lack
of
food
for
i
had
eaten
but
once
that
day
i
grew
faint
and
sick
but
as
i
leaned
there
out
of
the
gloom
came
a
hand
that
fumbled
timidly
my
bowed
head
my
arm
my
hand
sir
are
you
hurt
questioned
a
voice
and
here
once
again
i
was
struck
by
the
strange
vital
quality
of
this
voice
its
depth
and
sweetness
no
whit
says
i
now
as
i
spoke
it
chanced
she
touched
the
knife
in
my
grasp
and
i
felt
her
shiver
a
little
did
you
o
sir
did
you
kill
him
and
wherefore
no
i
questioned
and
why
call
me
you
do
speak
as
one
of
gentle
birth
and
go
like
the
beggar
i
am
in
rags
i
am
no
how
may
i
call
you
call
me
rogue
thief
murderer
what
ye
will
is
all
one
but
as
for
you
quoth
i
lifting
my
head
is
time
you
were
gone
see
yonder
and
i
pointed
where
a
light
winked
through
the
trees
a
light
that
danced
to
and
fro
coming
slowly
nearer
until
it
stopped
all
at
once
then
rose
a
shout
answered
by
other
shouts
and
a
roar
of
dismayed
blasphemy
at
this
my
companion
pressed
nearer
so
that
i
felt
her
shiver
again
let
us
be
gone
she
whispered
marjorie
come
child
let
us
haste
so
we
went
on
together
at
speed
and
ever
as
we
went
that
small
soft
hand
was
upon
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
so
we
sped
on
through
the
dark
these
two
maids
and
i
unseeing
and
unseen
speaking
little
by
reason
of
our
haste
presently
the
rain
ceased
the
wind
abated
its
rage
and
the
thunder
pealed
faint
with
distance
while
ever
and
anon
the
gloom
gave
place
to
a
vague
light
where
beyond
the
flying
a
faint
moon
peeped
guided
by
that
slender
hand
so
soft
and
yet
instinct
with
warm
and
vigorous
life
i
stumbled
on
through
leafy
ways
traversed
a
little
wood
on
and
ever
on
until
the
trees
thinning
showed
beyond
a
glimmer
of
the
great
high
road
here
i
stayed
madam
says
i
making
some
ado
over
the
unfamiliar
word
you
should
be
safe
now
and
as
i
do
think
your
road
lieth
yonder
pembury
is
but
a
mile
hence
says
she
and
there
we
may
get
horses
come
at
least
this
night
you
shall
find
comfort
and
shelter
no
says
i
no
i
am
a
thing
of
the
roads
and
well
enough
in
hedge
or
rick
and
i
would
have
turned
but
her
hand
upon
my
sleeve
restrained
me
sir
says
she
be
you
what
you
will
you
are
a
man
who
you
are
i
know
and
care
not
but
you
have
this
night
wrought
that
i
shall
nevermore
forget
and
now
i
we
would
fain
express
our
gratitude
indeed
and
indeed
said
the
maid
marjorie
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
want
no
gratitude
says
i
mighty
gruff
yet
shall
it
follow
thee
for
the
passion
of
gratitude
is
strong
and
may
not
be
denied
even
by
beggar
so
proud
and
arrogant
and
now
hearkening
to
this
voice
so
deep
and
soft
and
strangely
sweet
i
knew
not
if
she
laughed
at
me
or
no
but
even
as
i
debated
this
within
myself
she
lifted
my
hand
the
hand
that
grasped
the
knife
and
i
felt
the
close
firm
pressure
of
two
warm
soft
lips
then
she
had
freed
me
and
i
fell
back
a
step
striving
for
speech
yet
finding
none
god
love
me
quoth
i
at
last
why
must
you
do
so
and
wherefore
not
she
questioned
proudly
is
the
hand
of
a
vagrant
an
outcast
a
poor
creeper
o
ditches
says
i
but
a
man
hand
she
answered
is
at
hand
that
hath
slain
once
this
night
and
shall
slay
again
ere
many
hours
be
sped
now
here
i
heard
her
sigh
as
one
that
is
troubled
and
yet
says
she
gently
is
no
murderer
hand
and
you
that
are
vagrant
and
outcast
are
no
rogue
how
judge
ye
this
having
never
seen
me
i
questioned
in
that
i
am
a
woman
for
god
hath
armed
our
weakness
with
a
gift
of
knowledge
whereby
we
may
know
truth
from
falsehood
the
noble
from
the
base
all
their
outward
seeming
so
do
i
judge
you
no
rogue
a
strong
man
but
very
aye
very
young
that
belike
hath
suffered
unjustly
and
being
so
young
art
fierce
and
impatient
of
all
things
and
apt
to
rail
bitterly
the
world
not
so
aye
says
i
marvelling
truly
is
like
witchcraft
mayhap
you
will
speak
me
my
name
at
this
she
laughed
most
wonderful
to
hear
and
vastly
so
to
such
coarse
rogue
as
i
whose
ears
had
long
been
strangers
to
aught
but
sounds
of
evil
and
foul
obscenity
nay
says
she
my
knowledge
of
you
goeth
no
further
but
and
here
she
paused
to
fetch
a
shuddering
breath
but
for
him
you
killed
that
beast
you
did
but
what
i
would
have
done
for
o
man
had
you
not
come
i
i
should
have
killed
him
maid
though
i
am
see
here
is
the
dagger
i
snatched
from
his
girdle
as
he
strove
with
me
o
take
it
take
it
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
she
thrust
the
weapon
into
my
grasp
o
madam
my
lady
cried
her
companion
look
yonder
be
lights
lanthorns
aflare
on
the
road
is
gregory
as
i
do
think
with
folk
come
to
seek
for
us
shall
we
go
meet
them
nay
wait
child
first
let
us
be
sure
so
side
by
side
we
stood
all
three
amid
the
dripping
trees
watching
the
tossing
lights
that
grew
ever
nearer
until
we
might
hear
the
voices
of
those
that
bare
them
raised
ever
and
anon
in
confused
shouting
aye
is
gregory
sighed
my
lady
after
some
while
he
hath
raised
the
village
and
we
are
safe
hark
cried
i
starting
forward
what
name
do
they
cry
upon
mine
sir
oho
my
lady
roared
the
hoarse
chorus
oho
my
lady
joan
my
lady
brandon
brandon
brandon
brandon
cried
i
choking
upon
the
word
indeed
sir
i
am
the
lady
joan
brandon
of
shene
manor
and
so
long
as
life
be
mine
needs
must
i
bear
within
my
grateful
heart
the
memory
of
but
waiting
for
no
more
i
turned
and
sprang
away
into
the
denser
gloom
of
the
wood
and
ever
as
i
went
crashing
and
stumbling
through
the
underbrush
above
the
noise
of
my
headlong
flight
rang
the
hated
name
of
the
enemy
i
had
journeyed
so
far
to
kill
brandon
brandon
brandon
chapter
ii
how
i
heard
a
song
in
the
wood
at
midnight
headlong
went
i
staying
for
nought
and
heedless
of
all
direction
but
presently
being
weary
and
short
of
breath
i
halted
and
leaning
against
a
tree
stood
thus
very
full
of
bitter
thought
the
storm
was
quite
passed
but
a
chill
wind
was
abroad
that
moaned
dismally
while
all
about
me
sodden
trees
dripped
with
mournful
sobbing
noises
and
hearkening
to
all
this
what
should
i
be
thinking
but
of
the
sweet
soft
tones
of
a
woman
voice
that
had
stirred
within
me
memories
of
better
days
a
voice
that
had
set
me
to
dreams
of
a
future
to
fond
and
foolish
imaginings
for
though
shamed
and
brutalised
by
my
sufferings
i
was
a
man
and
in
this
past
hour
strange
though
it
do
seem
felt
scorn
of
myself
and
a
yearning
for
higher
things
and
all
this
by
no
greater
reason
than
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
in
the
dark
and
the
touch
of
her
warm
lips
on
my
hand
and
she
a
brandon
and
now
as
the
bitter
mockery
of
it
all
rushed
upon
me
fierce
anger
swept
me
and
i
broke
forth
into
vile
oaths
and
cursings
english
and
spanish
foul
invectives
picked
up
from
the
rogues
my
fellows
in
misery
and
feeling
a
new
shame
therefore
did
but
curse
the
more
so
there
crouched
i
the
tree
shivering
like
the
miserable
wretch
i
was
and
consumed
with
a
ravening
hunger
at
last
becoming
aware
that
i
yet
grasped
a
weapon
in
either
hand
i
thrust
my
knife
in
my
girdle
and
fell
to
handling
this
other
judging
it
by
touch
since
it
was
yet
too
dark
for
eyes
to
serve
me
and
by
its
feel
i
knew
it
for
no
honest
knife
here
was
a
thing
wrought
by
foreign
hands
a
haft
cunningly
shaped
and
wrought
a
blade
curiously
slender
and
long
and
a
very
deadly
thing
i
judged
by
the
feel
now
since
it
had
no
sheath
and
it
so
sharp
i
twisted
my
neckerchief
about
it
from
pommel
to
and
thrusting
it
into
the
leathern
wallet
at
my
belt
went
on
some
way
further
the
trees
seeking
some
place
where
i
might
be
sheltered
from
the
cold
wind
then
all
at
once
i
heard
that
which
brought
me
to
a
stand
a
man
was
singing
and
at
no
great
distance
a
strange
merry
air
and
stranger
words
and
the
voice
was
loud
yet
tuneful
and
mellow
and
the
words
the
which
i
came
to
know
all
too
well
were
these
cheerly
o
and
cheerly
o
right
cheerly
i
sing
o
whiles
at
the
mainyard
to
and
fro
we
watch
a
dead
man
swing
o
with
a
rumbelow
and
to
and
fro
he
by
the
neck
doth
swing
o
one
by
the
knife
did
part
wi
life
and
three
the
bullet
took
o
but
three
times
three
died
plaguily
on
a
hook
o
a
hook
both
strong
and
bright
and
long
they
died
by
gash
o
hook
o
so
cheerly
o
and
cheerly
o
come
shake
a
leg
lads
all
wi
a
and
a
rumbelow
and
shipmates
haul
o
some
swam
in
rum
to
kingdom
come
full
many
a
lusty
fellow
and
since
they
dead
i
lay
my
head
they
flaming
now
in
hell
o
so
cheerly
o
so
cheerly
o
waiting
for
no
more
of
the
vile
rant
i
strode
forward
and
thus
presently
came
on
a
small
dell
or
dingle
full
of
the
light
of
a
fire
that
crackled
right
merrily
at
the
which
most
welcome
sight
i
made
shift
to
scramble
down
the
steepy
bank
forthright
and
approached
the
blaze
on
eager
feet
drawing
near
i
saw
the
fire
burned
within
a
small
cave
beneath
the
bank
and
as
i
came
within
its
radiance
the
song
broke
off
suddenly
and
a
man
rose
up
facing
me
across
the
fire
and
with
one
hand
hid
under
the
flap
of
his
side
pocket
fibs
off
your
popps
cull
quoth
in
the
vernacular
of
the
roads
here
none
but
a
pal
as
lacketh
warmth
and
a
bite
aha
quoth
the
fellow
peering
across
the
blaze
and
who
be
you
stand
and
give
a
show
o
your
figurehead
obediently
i
stood
with
hands
outspread
to
the
flame
warming
my
shivering
body
at
its
grateful
heat
well
says
i
why
quoth
he
nodding
you
big
enough
and
wild
enough
and
as
likely
a
as
another
what
the
lay
the
high
pad
says
i
where
away
is
no
matter
all
i
asks
is
quoth
the
fellow
with
a
quizzical
look
how
fobbed
the
so
long
and
what
i
ask
is
quoth
i
how
a
comes
to
know
the
patter
o
the
flash
coves
is
no
matter
says
he
but
since
you
o
the
brotherhood
sit
ye
and
welcome
is
dry
enough
here
in
this
cave
staying
for
no
second
bidding
i
entered
the
little
cave
and
sat
me
down
in
the
comforting
warmth
of
the
fire
the
man
was
a
comely
fellow
of
a
hectoring
swashing
air
bright
of
eyes
and
instant
of
gesture
close
to
hand
lay
a
short
pistols
bulged
his
deep
while
betwixt
his
knees
was
a
battered
well
says
he
eyeing
me
over
what
the
word
food
says
i
nary
a
bite
he
answered
shaking
his
head
but
here
rum
now
if
you
a
mind
to
sluice
the
ivories
ha
not
a
drop
says
i
good
the
more
for
me
he
nodded
rum
ha
some
swam
in
rum
to
kingdom
come
you
sing
a
mighty
strange
song
quoth
i
ha
d
like
it
no
i
do
and
wherefore
no
there
seems
overmuch
death
in
it
death
cries
he
with
a
great
laugh
and
hugging
his
death
says
you
aye
aye
says
i
and
so
there
is
death
in
every
line
o
is
song
as
was
made
for
dead
men
of
dead
men
by
a
dead
man
and
there
for
ye
now
here
he
lifted
the
bottle
drank
and
thereafter
smacked
his
lips
with
great
gusto
made
by
a
dead
man
he
repeated
for
dead
men
of
dead
men
and
there
for
ye
i
like
your
song
less
and
less
you
a
cursed
queasy
stomach
i
think
he
hiccupped
and
an
empty
one
says
i
is
a
song
well
bethought
on
by
by
better
men
nor
you
for
all
your
size
says
he
glancing
at
me
over
his
bottle
with
a
truculent
eye
and
though
his
glance
was
steady
i
perceived
the
drink
was
affecting
him
more
and
more
aye
many
a
better
man
he
nodded
frowning
as

questioned

lay
to

delicate
cove

took
another
draught
and
nodded
at
me
in
drunken
solemnity
and
my
dainty
cull
when

as
much
death
as
abnegation
mings
you
know

i
at
a
venture

nodded
and
then
ha

i
met

where
away
in
a
tavern
some
mile
hence

cried
he
scowling
i
would
quick
as

he
clapped
hand
to
pocket
but
the
pistol
caught
on
the
lining
and
before
he
could
free
it
i
had
covered
him
with
mine
whereat
he
grew
suddenly
rigid
and
still
up
wi
your
fambles
says
obediently
he
raised
his
hands
and
taking
his
pistols
i
opened
the
pan
of

and
having
blown
out

primings

and
wha
what

could

and
there
women
i
too
here
he
fell
to
singing
certain
lewd
ribaldry
that
i
will
not
here
set
down
until
what
with
the
rum
and
the
drowsy
heat
of
the
fire
that
i
had
replenished
he
yawned
stretched
and
laying
himself
down
very
soon
fell
to
my
no
small
comfort
as
for
me
i
sat
there
waiting
for
the
dayspring
the
fire
sank
lower
and
lower
filling
the
little
cave
with
a
rosy
glow
falling
athwart
the
sprawling
form
of
the
sleeper
and
making
his
red
face
seem
purplish
and
suffused
like
the
face
of
one
i
had
once
seen
dead
of
strangulation
howbeit
he
slept
well
enough
judging
from
his
lusty
snoring
now
presently
in
the
surrounding
dark
beyond
the
smouldering
fire
was
a
glimmer
a
vague
blur
of
sloping
trampled
bank
backed
by
misty
trees
so
came
the
dawn
very
chill
and
full
of
eddying
mists
that
crawled
filling
the
little
dingle
brimful
and
blotting
out
the
surrounding
trees
in
a
little
i
arose
and
coming
without
the
cave
shivered
in
the
colder
air
shaken
with
raging
hunger
and
now
remembering
my
utter
destitution
i
stooped
to
peer
down
at
the
sleeper
half
minded
to
go
through
his
pockets
but
in
a
while
i
turned
away
and
left
him
sprawled
in
his
sottish
slumber
chapter
iii
tells
how
i
stole
my
breakfast
the
mist
lay
very
thick
all
about
me
but
when
i
had
climbed
to
higher
ground
it
thinned
away
somewhat
so
that
as
the
pallid
light
grew
i
began
to
see
something
of
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
storm
here
and
there
lay
trees
uprooted
while
everywhere
was
a
tangle
of
broken
boughs
and
trailing
branches
insomuch
that
i
found
my
going
no
small
labour
but
presently
as
i
forced
a
way
through
these
leafy
tangles
the
birds
awaking
began
to
fill
the
dim
world
with
blithe
chirpings
that
grew
and
grew
to
a
sweet
clamour
ever
swelling
until
the
dark
woods
thrilled
with
gladsome
music
and
i
beholding
the
first
beam
of
sun
felt
heartened
thereby
my
lack
of
sleep
and
the
gnawing
of
hunger
sharp
fangs
and
hastened
with
blither
steps
thus
in
a
while
i
brake
forth
of
the
desolate
trees
and
came
out
upon
a
fair
rolling
meadow
with
blooming
hedgerows
before
me
and
beyond
the
high
road
and
now
as
i
stayed
to
get
my
bearings
up
rose
the
sun
in
majesty
all
glorious
in
purple
and
pink
and
gold
whose
level
beams
turned
the
world
around
me
into
a
fair
garden
all
sweet
and
fresh
and
green
while
in
the
scowling
woods
behind
the
sullen
mists
crept
furtive
away
till
they
were
vanished
quite
and
those
leafy
solitudes
became
a
very
glory
but
my
hunger
was
very
sore
a
need
i
purposed
to
satisfy
soon
and
at
all
hazards
therefore
having
marked
my
direction
i
went
at
speed
and
crossing
the
meadow
came
into
the
highway
and
struck
south
on
my
going
through
the
woods
i
had
chosen
me
a
cudgel
in
place
of
the
one
lost
shortish
and
knotted
and
very
apt
for
quick
and
i
plucked
forth
my
sailor
knife
meaning
to
trim
my
staff
therewith
but
with
it
poised
in
my
hand
i
stopped
all
at
once
for
i
saw
that
the
point
of
the
stout
blade
the
which
i
had
sharpened
and
whetted
to
an
extreme
keenness
i
perceived
i
say
that
the
blade
was
bent
somewhat
and
the
point
turned
now
as
i
strode
on
again
the
early
sun
flashing
back
from
the
steel
i
fell
to
wondering
how
this
had
chanced
and
bethinking
me
of
those
two
deadly
blows
i
had
struck
in
the
dark
i
scrutinised
my
knife
blade
and
haft
yet
found
nowhere
on
it
any
trace
of
blood
so
that
was
manifest
the
fellow
had
worn
some
protection
were
common
enough
and
many
a
rogue
went
with
a
steel
skull
to
line
his
hat
so
it
seemed
the
fellow
lived
yet
and
black
rogue
though
he
was
i
was
vaguely
glad
was
not
my
hand
had
sent
him
to
his
account
i
was
yet
revolving
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
i
heard
a
loud
and
merry
whistling
and
glancing
up
beheld
a
country
fellow
approaching
down
a
side
lane
he
wore
a
hat
and
his
smock
was
and
speckless
but
that
which
drew
and
held
my
eyes
that
which
brought
me
to
a
sudden
stand
was
the
bundle
he
bore
wrapped
in
a
fair
white
clout
so
with
my
gaze
on
this
i
stood
leaning
on
my
knotted
untrimmed
staff
waiting
him
suddenly
chancing
to
turn
his
head
he
espied
me
halted
in
his
stride
then
eyeing
me
askance
advanced
again
a
small
man
he
was
with
rosy
face
little
merry
eyes
and
a
wide
mouth
goo
marnin
to
it
do
have
been
a
bad
starm
las
night
master
aye
says
i
and
my
heart
warmed
to
him
by
reason
of
his
good
kentish
tongue
the
like
of
which
i
had
not
heard
these
many
weary
years
but
at
sight
of
that
bundle
my
mouth
watered
and
hunger
gnawed
with
sharper
tooth
what
have
ye
here
i
questioned
touching
this
with
my
staff
but
my
dinner
master
ever
was
nay
says
i
scowling
i
think
not
aye
but
it
be
master
he
nodded
bread
and
beef
wi
a
mossel
of
cheese
like
ever
was
bread
says
i
beef
cheese
liar
here
is
no
dinner
o
yours
aye
master
but
it
do
be
so
sure
quoth
he
staring
my
very
own
dinner
cut
by
my
very
own
darter
beef
an
bread
an
a
mossel
cheese
i
take
my
bible
oath
t
it
i
do
bread
an
beef
an
a
mossel
show
me
with
notable
haste
he
undid
the
wrapping
discovering
a
good
a
thick
slice
of
roast
beef
and
a
slab
of
yellow
cheese
ha
man
quoth
i
shut
teeth
so
you
lied
to
me
then
lied
to
master
says
he
faintly
you
told
me
was
your
dinner
aye
and
so
it
be
so
it
be
i
lay
my
oath
beef
d
see
an
a
mossel
nay
says
i
gathering
up
the
viands
here
my
breakfast
is
it
says
he
gaping
it
is
would
ye
deny
it
not
for
a
moment
says
he
eyeing
my
staff
and
the
gleaming
knife
in
my
belt
lordy
no
only
how
was
i
to
know
yourn
master
when
my
darter
cut
it
for
her
very
own
feyther
we
live
and
we
learn
says
i
turning
away
what
might
your
name
be
tucker
master
why
then
though
my
gain
be
your
loss
take
comfort
in
that
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
receive
moreover
though
you
lack
a
dinner
you
have
a
daughter
and
a
roof
to
shelter
you
and
i
neither
one
nor
other
a
poor
hungry
rogue
methinks
of
the
two
of
us
you
have
the
better
of
life
why
now
master
says
he
scratching
his
shaven
chin
since
you
got
your
breakfus
surely
if
you
minded
t
step
along
t
my
cottage
down
t
lane
i
can
give
ye
a
jug
of
good
ale
to
wash
it
down
now
as
he
spoke
thus
seeing
the
sturdy
manliness
of
him
i
dropped
my
staff
and
reached
out
my
hand
says
i
a
starving
man
must
eat
by
hook
or
crook
but
if
you
give
your
honest
hand
to
a
thief
there
mine
the
man
stared
from
my
hand
to
my
face
his
wide
mouth
curved
then
rubbing
hand
on
snowy
smock
he
grasped
my
fingers
and
wrung
them
heartily
a
clean
and
honest
grip
such
as
i
had
not
known
for
many
a
long
day
will
come
master
he
questioned
i
shook
my
head
quoth
i
you
have
a
daughter
and
i
no
fit
company
for
a
good
sweet
maid
nor
ever
shall
be
for
that
matter
so
saying
i
dropped
his
hand
and
turning
strode
away
down
the
road
his
dinner
beneath
my
arm
and
when
at
last
i
glanced
back
i
saw
him
standing
where
i
had
left
him
staring
after
me
chin
in
hand
presently
turning
in
at
a
gate
beside
the
way
i
sat
down
beneath
a
hedge
in
the
warm
level
beams
of
the
sun
and
fell
to
eating
with
huge
appetite
and
stolen
though
it
was
never
tasted
food
more
sweet
i
was
thus
rapturously
employed
when
i
heard
a
dolorous
whine
and
starting
about
beheld
a
ragged
creature
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hedge
who
glared
at
the
food
with
haggard
eyes
and
reached
out
hands
in
supplication
o
for
the
love
o
christ
spare
a
crust
she
wailed
spare
a
bite
to
a
grannam
as
dieth
o
hunger
o
sweet
jesu
a
mouthful
to
a
poor
soul
as
do
be
pined
for
lack
o
food
off
cries
i
fiercely
what
know
you
of
hunger
away
hag
and
i
reached
for
my
staff
whereupon
she
wailed
and
wept
and
clawing
her
dismal
rags
about
her
crept
away
moaning
but
now
while
my
jaws
champed
ravenously
the
food
had
lost
its
savour
wherefore
i
cursed
and
choked
and
springing
to
my
feet
made
after
her
but
seeing
me
follow
at
speed
she
cried
out
in
fear
and
striving
to
flee
from
me
sank
on
feeble
knees
old
hag
quoth
i
be
damned
for
spoiling
a
hungry
man
appetite
and
robbing
him
of
what
he
was
at
pains
to
rob
for
himself
then
i
thrust
the
napkin
into
her
clutching
fingers
and
hasted
away
but
her
raptured
cry
followed
me
as
i
went
i
trudged
on
slow
and
heavy
through
the
mud
being
very
weary
for
lack
of
sleep
and
mightily
down
cast
heedless
of
gladsome
morn
and
the
fair
fresh
world
about
me
conscious
but
of
my
own
most
miserable
estate
insomuch
that
i
presently
sank
down
on
the
grass
by
the
road
and
with
heavy
head
bowed
between
my
hands
gave
myself
up
to
black
despond
but
now
as
i
sat
thus
very
sick
and
sorrowful
i
heard
a
sound
of
wheels
and
plodding
hoofs
drawing
slowly
near
and
lifting
my
head
at
last
espied
a
great
wain
piled
high
with
fragrant
hay
whereon
the
driver
sprawled
asleep
a
great
fat
fellow
whose
snores
rose
above
the
jingle
of
harness
and
creak
of
wheels
now
hearkening
to
his
snoring
beholding
him
so
gross
and
and
i
starving
my
sadness
gave
place
to
sudden
hot
anger
and
as
the
waggon
lumbered
by
i
swung
myself
up
behind
and
clambering
over
the
hay
raised
my
staff
minded
to
drub
the
fellow
into
wakefulness
but
even
then
i
stayed
the
blow
for
i
spied
a
wallet
that
hung
to
the
a
large
wallet
of
plump
and
inviting
aspect
reaching
it
down
i
opened
it
forthwith
and
found
therein
a
loaf
a
roast
capon
delicately
browned
and
a
jar
of
small
beer
and
now
couched
luxuriously
among
the
hay
i
fell
to
work
tooth
and
nail
and
though
i
ate
in
voracious
haste
never
before
or
since
have
i
tasted
aught
so
delicate
and
savoury
as
that
stolen
fowl
i
was
yet
busied
with
what
remained
of
the
carcass
when
the
fat
fellow
choked
in
his
snoring
sighed
grunted
propped
himself
on
lazy
elbow
and
catching
sight
of
me
fell
so
whiles
he
watched
i
finished
what
remained
of
the
capon
and
tossed
the
bones
over
the
hedge
ecod
quoth
he
faintly
o
ecod
my
dinner
as
for
me
having
my
mouth
full
i
spake
not
ad
bobs
says
he
a
rascally
robbing
thief
of
the
roads
even
so
i
nodded
and
took
a
long
draught
of
his
beer
and
of
a
honest
man
dinner
by
the
lord
says
he
clenching
fat
fists
o
ecod
a
rogue
a
very
lousy
scurvy
dog
as
shall
be
carted
and
whipped
and
set
in
sir
richard
new
pillory
at
this
being
engaged
with
the
bread
i
reached
out
my
foot
and
kicked
him
very
featly
in
the
belly
whereat
he
gasped
and
growing
thoughtful
dolefully
watched
me
make
an
end
if
there
is
aught
left
to
eat
says
i
show
it
me
as
fine
a
capon
as
was
ever
plucked
by
the
lord
he
groaned
most
true
says
i
stretching
myself
in
the
hay
o
quoth
he
as
to
himself
o
the
pity
o
so
foul
an
end
to
so
fair
a
bird
never
whine
says
i
but
tell
me
how
far
hence
lieth
lamberhurst
better
nor
six
mile
he
sighed
heaving
himself
into
the
why
then
do
you
carry
me
thither
ad
love
he
mourned
is
manifest
shame
a
rogue
should
thieve
the
food
of
an
honest
man
a
man
like
i
be
as
do
slave
morning
noon
and
slave
says
i
frowning
what
know
you
of

curst

a
great
fat
fool
that
speaketh
lies
now
watching
him
as
i
lay
i
saw
his
hand
close
stealthily
on
his
heavy
whip
but
or
ever
he
could
turn
to
strike
i
rose
and
fetched
him
a
buffet
the
ear
that
pitched
him
sprawling
upon
the
broad
backs
of
his
horses
whence
with
much
groaning
and
puffing
he
presently
got
him
safely
into
the
road
seeing
the
which
i
took
the
reins
whipping
the
team
to
faster
gait
so
that
to
keep
pace
he
must
needs
trot
it
in
the
mud
hold
cries
he
what
would

wi
my
waggon
ride
in

then
suffer
me
to

scant
o

i
and

i
aloft
and
at
mine
ease
and
the
fat
fellow
trotting
breathless
at
the
wheel
we
went
awhile
and
never
another
word
until
what
with
fear
of
losing
his
goods
what
with
the
mud
and
heat
and
sweat
the
poor
gross
fool
looked
wellnigh
spent
and
all
foredone
as
i
had
seen
many
a
better
man
than
he
whereupon
i
brought
the
waggon
to
a
stand
and
reached
down
to
stir
him
where
he
lent
across

wheel

and

and
cast
a
yearning
eye
towards
his
wallet
parched
wi
thirst

groaned

i
and
having

trueman
nodding
until
his
fat
cheeks
quivered
and
one
that
doth
abhor
vagrants
and
vermin
as
myself
says
i
to
this
trueman
answered
nothing
but
fell
himself
with
his
hat
again
eyeing
me
warily
the
while
art
strange
in
these
parts
he
questioned
aye
and
no
hast
met

the

but
what
of

strong

a
power

trueman
flicking
his
plodding
horses
neither

not
quoth
i
and
wherefore
because
he
dead
dead
says
i
starting
up
dead
why
if
he
ai
dead
leastways
but
here
i
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
twisting
him
round
shook
him
to
and
fro
till
he
choked
rogue
damned
rogue
i
cried
gnashing
teeth
will
ye
mock
me
then
no

he
gasped
then
tell
me

then
sir
richard
lieth
snug
in
his
manor
of
shene
doth
he
not
aye
or
no
aye
aye
at
shene
at
shene
hereupon
i
loosed
him
and
falling
back
on
the
hay
found
myself
all
breathless
and
shaking
as
with
an
and
these
tremors
were
within
me
as
without
since
by
reason
of
this
fellow
lying
words
i
had
for
one
black
moment
doubting
god
justice
seen
as
it
were
my
countless
anguished
supplications
for
vengeance
on
mine
enemy
so
much
vain
breath
and
this
my
toilsome
journey
a
labour
to
no
purpose
but
now
bowing
my
head
i
who
knew
no
forgiveness
humbly
prayed
forgiveness
of
god
for
my
doubting
of
god
and
passionately
besought
him
that
he
would
cherish
mine
enemy
and
save
him
in
health
and
this
to
no
other
end
but
that
i
myself
might
destroy
him
his
life
o
god
give
this
man
life
into
mine
hand
so
prayed
i
in
my
vain
pride
and
selfish
blindness
as
i
jogged
along
that
sunny
midsummer
morn
and
thereafter
my
trembling
having
passed
from
me
i
stretched
myself
out
amid
the
hay
and
fell
to
blissful
slumber
now
to
all
such
as
reading
this
my
narrative
shall
contemn
and
abhor
me
for
the
purblind
fool
and
poor
desperate
wretch
i
was
and
who
living
but
for
murder
could
cry
thus
on
god
for
the
blood
of
his
to
all
such
i
would
say
that
none
can
despise
me
more
utterly
than
i
who
write
these
words
for
life
since
then
hath
learned
me
many
truths
and
in
some
few
things
i
am
mayhap
a
little
wiser
but
because
i
was
proud
and
stubborn
beyond
belief
because
hate
begetteth
hate
and
evil
evil
so
came
i
to
consort
and
make
fellowship
with
pirates
and
the
like
rogues
and
to
endure
much
of
harms
and
dangers
as
battle
shipwreck
prison
and
solitude
until
god
of
his
infinite
mercy
brought
me
forth
a
better
man
therefor
and
in
some
sense
a
more
worthy
all
of
the
which
i
have
fully
and
faithfully
recorded
for
such
as
shall
trouble
to
read
this
narrative
to
the
end
and
so
will
i
again
to
my
story
chapter
iv
telleth
how
i
met
one
adam
penfeather
i
awoke
to
find
the
waggon
at
a
standstill
and
master
trueman
watching
me
with
a
scowl
the
while
his
plump
fingers
toyed
lovingly
with
his
but
as
i
roused
this
hand
crept
up
to
finger
his
several
chins
yonder
lieth
lamberhurst
quoth
he
sulkily
and
nodded
where
in
the
valley
below
was
a
village
with
a
green
wherein
was
a
placid
pool
shaded
by
trees
and
about
this
green
stood
cottages
many
of
them
bowered
in
roses
or
honeysuckle
to
the
very
thatch
right
pleasant
to
the
eye
while
beyond
these
again
rose
gables
of
barns
or
the
pointed
roofs
of
oasthouses
lamberhurst
says
trueman
again
whereon
having
yawned
and
stretched
myself
i
clambered
down
into
the
road
well
i
questioned
seeing
how
he
watched
me
triple
chin
in
hand
well
quoth
he
stoutly
i
be
wondering
what
the
likes
o
you
should
be
wanting
wi
the
likes
o
sir
richard
brandon
o
shene
nought
but
this
says
i
shaking
the
hay
from
my
tattered
cloak
i
am
come
to
watch
him
die
and
the
manner
of
it
shall
mayhap
be
something
slow
and
painful
and
speaking
i
clenched
my
right
hand
to
a
sunburnt
fist
now
looking
on
this
clutching
hand
trueman
blinked
and
saying
no
word
whipped
his
horses
and
the
heavy
wain
rumbled
and
creaked
on
its
way
but
when
he
had
gone
some
distance
he
grinned
at
me
over
his
shoulder
and
called
something
whereof
i
caught
the
words
labour
lost
for
a
moment
i
was
minded
to
run
after
and
demand
his
meaning
howbeit
in
a
little
i
turned
and
went
down
the
hill
very
full
of
thought
reaching
the
village
i
found
it
not
yet
astir
for
the
clock
of
the
church
tower
showed
the
time
was
but
half
after
four
and
now
leaning
on
my
staff
i
stared
up
at
the
church
tower
with
its
new
weathercock
brave
with
gilding
agleam
in
the
early
sun
and
from
thence
turned
my
gaze
where
hard
beside
the
pool
upon
the
green
rose
the
grim
shape
of
sir
richard
new
pillory
just
now
it
stood
untenanted
and
i
wondered
idly
what
unhappy
wight
was
destined
next
to
suffer
there
thus
stood
i
some
while
staring
round
me
on
this
peaceful
hamlet
where
all
save
only
myself
forgot
their
cares
awhile
in
blessed
sleep
the
wide
road
the
gabled
cottages
and
fragrant
rick
yard
all
was
as
i
minded
it
five
weary
years
since
nothing
strange
was
there
saving
only
sir
richard
hateful
pillory
wherefore
i
smote
it
with
my
staff
and
cursing
him
that
set
it
there
turned
away
now
within
a
of
the
church
was
a
goodly
tavern
with
a
weatherbeaten
signboard
above
the
door
whereon
was
painted
what
purported
to
be
a
leopard
asleep
and
below
the
following
legend
viz
rouse
me
not
and
below
this
again
ye
conisby
arms
from
this
i
glanced
at
the
third
finger
of
my
left
hand
which
was
a
battered
signet
ring
that
bore
the
semblance
of
another
sleeping
leopard
and
the
like
inscription
and
looking
from
the
sleeping
leopard
on
the
signboard
to
the
sleeping
leopard
on
my
ring
i
fell
to
deep
and
gloomy
thought
howbeit
rousing
in
a
while
i
perceived
a
hard
by
full
of
clean
water
and
came
thither
minded
to
wash
the
dust
and
sweat
from
me
but
stooping
i
paused
and
stood
thus
staring
down
at
the
face
that
scowled
up
at
me
a
face
lean
and
haggard
with
wide
fierce
eyes
agleam
beneath
knitted
brows
a
prominent
nose
and
square
chin
with
short
peaked
golden
beard
an
unlovely
face
framed
in
shaggy
yellow
hair
patched
and
streaked
with
silver
and
beholding
lowering
brow
and
ferocious
mouth
and
jaw
i
stood
awhile
marvelling
at
the
evil
and
hardship
had
wrought
in
me
for
thus
was
it
that
i
first
beheld
myself
after
five
years
of
slavery
having
looked
my
fill
i
nodded
grimly
at
my
watery
image
and
plunged
my
face
and
head
within
the
trough
to
my
great
refreshment
which
done
i
made
shift
to
dry
myself
on
my
tattered
shirt
thereafter
coming
to
the
broad
oak
settle
beside
the
tavern
door
i
sat
down
and
fell
to
meditation
but
now
moved
by
sudden
impulse
i
unbuckled
the
wallet
at
my
girdle
and
taking
thence
the
strange
dagger
unwound
the
neckerchief
that
swathed
it
and
began
to
examine
the
weapon
first
carelessly
enough
then
with
growing
interest
and
wonder
the
blade
as
i
have
told
elsewhere
was
triangular
of
form
very
narrow
and
some
eight
inches
in
length
and
exceeding
sharp
of
point
but
that
which
drew
and
held
my
gaze
was
the
wonder
of
its
haft
i
have
seen
and
handled
many
fair
weapons
in
my
day
but
never
before
or
since
have
i
beheld
such
rare
craftsmanship
as
went
to
the
chiselling
of
this
hilt
of
silver
it
was
wrought
into
the
shape
of
a
standing
woman
her
feet
poised
upon
the
small
chiselled
her
head
forming
the
pommel
naked
she
stood
in
languorous
pose
arms
raised
and
hands
locked
behind
her
head
the
delicate
chiselling
of
the
features
was
worn
somewhat
by
handling
and
rough
usage
but
even
so
the
evil
beauty
of
the
face
was
plain
and
manifest
the
wanton
languor
of
the
long
eyes
the
mocking
cruelty
of
the
smiling
mouth
the
longer
i
viewed
it
the
more
manifest
became
the
nameless
evil
of
the
thing
so
that
i
was
greatly
minded
to
whirl
it
into
the
and
be
done
with
it
but
bethinking
me
of
my
destitution
and
not
doubting
but
that
i
might
find
a
ready
market
for
a
thing
so
rare
i
lapped
it
up
again
and
thrusting
it
back
into
my
wallet
stretched
myself
out
upon
the
broad
settle
and
presently
fell
asleep
but
even
as
i
slept
methought
i
was
back
in
torment
i
seemed
to
hear
again
the
crack
of
whips
the
harsh
cries
of
the
drivers
the
shrill
screams
and
curses
the
long
groaning
breaths
with
the
rattle
and
creak
of
the
great
oars
as
they
swung
ceaselessly
back
and
forth
nay
i
could
even
feel
the
kick
of
the
that
had
escaped
my
fainting
grasp
so
real
was
it
all
that
i
waked
groaning
as
i
had
done
many
a
time
and
oft
waked
to
find
the
kindly
sun
making
a
glory
about
me
and
a
blackbird
hard
by
most
sweet
to
hear
while
before
me
stood
a
little
thin
fellow
in
a
hat
who
peered
at
me
through
narrowed
eyes
and
poked
at
me
with
a
stick
and
how
the
wind
shipmate
he
questioned
i
sat
up
and
scowled
whereupon
he
tucked
the
stick
beneath
an
arm
and
stood
viewing
me
chin
in
hand
you
sleep
mighty
sound
says
he
here
i
stood
at
ye
with
my
stick
d
see
and
you
snore
but
the
louder
or
was
it
groans
for
the
which
poking
i
minded
to
throw
you
into
the
why
that
as
may
be
says
he
falling
back
a
step
but
no
offence
shipmate
then
leave
me
in
peace
and
i
laid
me
down
again
you
sleep
mighty
sound
says
he
and
your
bed
none
so
easy
i
known
worse
aye
the
of
a
spanish
floating
hell
shipmate
ha
at
this
i
started
and
turned
to
look
at
him
again
he
was
as
i
say
a
little
man
and
clad
in
suit
of
very
trim
and
sober
but
at
his
hip
he
bore
a
long
rapier
or
tuck
while
in
his
ears
which
were
trimmed
to
points
in
mighty
strange
fashion
swung
great
gold
rings
such
as
mariners
do
wear
his
face
was
lean
and
sharp
and
wide
of
mouth
and
lighted
by
very
quick
bright
eyes
seeming
to
take
in
all
things
with
glances
a
scar
that
ran
from
brow
to
chin
lent
to
him
a
certain
hangdog
air
as
to
his
age
it
might
have
been
thirty
or
forty
or
sixty
for
though
he
seemed
vigorous
and
active
with
smooth
unwrinkled
face
his
hair
was
well
shipmate
he
questioned
meeting
my
searching
gaze
and
how
d
like
me
no
whit
sink
me
but
that
plain
enough
says
he
smiling
ruefully
so
there
nought
in
me
as
draws
you
then
no
is
pity
for
i
a
feeling
we
shall
sail
aboard
ship
together
yet
how
should
you
know
i
rowed
aboard
a
spanish
ship
you
bear
the
mark
shipmate
as
you
lay
in
your
sleep
i
took
occasion
to
cast
an
eye
over
ye
d
see
and
what
wi
the
scars
on
your
wrist
your
sunburnt
skin
and
the
desperate
look
o
you
i
judged
you
from
slavery
and
named
a
spanish
galleass
at
a
venture
d
see
you
are
an
observant
man
it
seems
says
i
frowning
i
have
a
way
o
putting
one
and
one
together
is
a
trick
i
found
useful
now
and
then
ha
says
i
mighty
scornful
you
be
telling
me
my
own
name
next
why
as
to
that
says
he
pinching
his
long
chin
thoughtfully
how
would
conisby
suit
damned
spy
i
cried
and
caught
him
in
my
grip
the
fellow
never
so
much
as
flinched
and
there
was
something
formidable
in
his
very
quietude
easy
all
shipmate
says
he
mildly
and
staring
up
at
me
eye
to
eye
use
me
kindly
for
i
a
timid
soul
with
a
good
heart
meaning
no
offence
how
learned
ye
my
name
what
devilry
is
here
none
in
the
world
lord
love
ye
is
just
my
trick
of
adding
one
and
one
d
see
there
the
ring
on
your
finger
and
the
signboard
above
you
and
wherefore
spy
on
a
sleeping
man
because
i
a
lonely
soul
doth
seek
a
comrade
because
the
moment
i
clapped
eyes
on
you
i
felt
drawn
to
ye
and
seeing
the
scars
on
your
wrist
knew
for
and
was
a
bond
betwixt
us
how
a
bond
loose
me
shipmate
and
i
show
ye
which
done
he
bared
a
long
and
sinewy
arm
discovering
thereon
marks
of
old
like
those
upon
my
own
so
you
slaved
at
an
oar
then
says
i
aye
shipmate
endured
the
shame
of
stripes
and
nakedness
and
filth
aye
shipmate
and
more
i
fought
for
my
life
on
the
inca
ere
now
as
you
may
see
by
my
ears
if
you
know
aught
of
the
maya
indians
and
here
without
so
much
as
a
by
your
leave
he
sat
him
down
on
the
bench
beside
me
and
leaning
forward
began
to
trace
idle
patterns
in
the
dust
with
his
stick
shipmate
says
he
i
a
timid
man
as
a
snake
quoth
i
and
as
deadly
here
he
stayed
his
drawing
to
glance
at
me
askance
to
sigh
and
shake
his
head
you
misjudge
me
says
he
howbeit
we
say
cautious
a
cautious
man
with
an
honest
kindly
heart
as
yearns
to
fellowship
and
with
a
pistol
each
armpit
true
he
nodded
i
might
ha
shot
ye
a
moment
since
and
did
which
doth
but
prove
my
words
for
i
one
as
never
harmed
any
man
without
just
cause
save
once
and
that
here
he
sighed
was
years
agone
and
me
a
lonely
man
to
this
day
so
is
i
seek
a
comrade
a
right
man
one
at
odds
wi
fortune
and
the
world
and
therefore
apt
to
desperate
ploys
one
hath
suffered
and
endured
and
therefore
scornful
of
harms
and
dangers
one
as
knoweth
the
sea
now
let
that
man
pledge
me
the
let
him
stand
staunch
and
faithful
blow
fair
blow
foul
and
i
help
him
to
a
fortune
greater
than
ever
came
out
of
manoa
el
dorado
or
the
indies
come
what
d
say
friend
i
say
sheer
off
and
leave
me
to
my
sleep
lest
i
mischief
you
ha
ye
no
lust
for
riches
then
no
more
than
i
have
to
your
company
and
i
love
that
less
and
less
is
pity
says
he
shaking
his
head
aye
is
pity
for
i
do
like
you
more
and
more
such
a
fine
figure
of
a
rogue
shipmate
as
would
grace
a
better
than
most
which
is
one
reason
i
was
drawn
to
ye
d
see
i
being
a
quiet
soul
and
a
pirate
like
as
not
easy
shipmate
easy
passion
is
an
ill
word
to
steer
by
and
i
a
lonely
man
as
seeks
a
comrade
and
i
a
lonely
man
that
loveth
solitude
so
now
will
i
go
seek
it
and
i
rose
stay
a
bit
shipmate
haul
your
wind
and
listen
says
he
laying
hand
on
my
arm
stand
in
wi
me
blow
high
blow
low
and
i
offer
you
wealth
untold
riches
fortune
tush
says
i
empty
things
all
at
this
his
hold
tightened
while
his
keen
gaze
held
mine
more
than
this
says
he
slowly
i
offer
you
rank
honours
power
and
mayhap
love
shipmate
enough
quoth
i
you
offer
nought
i
desire
why
then
says
he
in
the
fiend
name
what
would
ye
have
vengeance
i
answered
and
shaking
off
his
grasp
i
turned
and
strode
away
along
the
dusty
road
chapter
v
how
i
came
to
conisby
shene
it
being
yet
full
early
for
my
purpose
i
took
to
the
woods
and
presently
chancing
upon
a
little
stream
that
bubbled
pleasantly
shady
willows
i
sat
myself
down
within
this
greeny
bower
and
fell
to
watching
the
hurrying
waters
of
this
brook
and
hearkening
to
its
drowsy
murmur
and
lying
thus
with
the
good
green
world
around
me
the
sunny
air
blithe
with
the
mellow
piping
of
birds
and
the
soft
wind
rustling
the
leaves
about
me
what
must
i
have
in
mind
but
bloodshed
and
the
destruction
of
my
enemy
insomuch
that
reaching
a
stone
from
the
brook
i
drew
the
knife
from
my
girdle
and
set
about
straightening
the
blade
thereof
i
was
thus
employed
when
all
at
once
the
leaves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
brook
were
parted
and
a
appeared
for
a
long
moment
we
eyed
each
other
across
the
brook
then
all
at
once
her
pretty
lips
curved
to
a
smile
little
maid
says
i
furtively
thrusting
the
knife
into
my
belt
art
not
afraid
of
me
then
nay
she
answered
smiling
yet
and
shaking
her
golden
head
and
why
i
do
like
your
eyes
big
man
kind
eyes
they
be
are
they
says
i
glancing
from
her
smiling
innocence
into
the
brook
aye
and
your
voice
i
do
like
that
too
is
low
and
soft
like
father
and
who
your
father
he
be
th
blacksmith
how
old
are
you
seven
an
a
big
maid
i
be
will
aid
me
now
so
i
lifted
her
over
and
there
we
sat
side
by
side
she
laughing
and
talking
and
i
hearkening
to
her
childish
prattle
with
marvellous
great
pleasure
presently
i
ventured
to
touch
her
soft
cheek
to
stroke
her
curls
and
finding
she
took
this
not
amiss
summoned
courage
to
stoop
and
kiss
her
how
long
we
had
sat
thus
i
know
not
when
i
was
aroused
by
a
shrill
harsh
voice
and
turning
beheld
a
bony
woman
who
peered
at
us
through
the
leaves
susan
ann
she
cried
o
you
susan
come
away
come
quick
or
run
for
your
mother
the
child
is
safe
enough
says
i
frowning
but
clasping
the
small
damsel
closer
within
my
arm
safe
cries
the
woman
turning
on
me
in
fury
safe
aye
for
sooth
wi
a
great
ill
rogue
the
like
o
you
loose
her
loose
her
or
scream
and
rouse
the
village
on
ye
for
a
wild
gipsy
wastrel
that
ye
are
and
here
the
old
harridan
railed
at
me
until
the
child
whimpered
for
fear
and
even
i
blenched
before
the
woman
fierce
aspect
and
shrewish
tongue
then
while
she
loaded
me
with
abuse
a
ceaseless
torrent
and
no
lack
of
breath
i
kissed
the
little
maid
cheek
and
setting
her
back
across
the
brook
stood
to
watch
until
the
child
and
woman
were
lost
to
my
sight
then
i
sat
down
scowling
at
the
hurrying
water
chin
on
fist
for
my
black
humour
banished
awhile
by
the
child
innocent
faith
in
me
was
returned
and
therewith
an
added
bitterness
scowling
yet
i
plucked
forth
my
knife
and
seizing
my
staff
set
to
trim
and
shape
it
to
a
formidable
weapon
and
as
i
worked
i
cursed
this
woman
deep
and
oft
yet
even
so
knew
she
had
the
right
o
for
truly
i
was
a
rogue
an
outcast
of
unlovely
look
and
unlovely
ways
a
desperate
fellow
unfit
for
the
company
of
decent
folk
much
less
an
innocent
child
and
yet
remembering
those
fearless
the
kiss
of
those
pure
i
sighed
amain
betwixt
my
muttered
cursings
at
last
having
trimmed
my
bludgeon
to
a
nicety
i
laid
it
by
and
sat
brooding
the
knife
betwixt
my
knees
now
a
beam
of
sun
falling
athwart
the
leaves
lit
upon
the
broad
blade
of
the
knife
and
made
of
it
a
glory
and
beholding
this
and
the
hand
that
grasped
it
i
took
pleasure
to
heed
how
strong
and
sinewy
were
my
fingers
and
how
the
muscles
bulged
beneath
the
brown
skin
of
my
forearm
and
turning
the
glittering
steel
this
way
and
that
i
fell
to
joyous
thought
of
my
enemy
and
of
my
vengeance
now
so
near
says
i
to
myself
death
ever
cometh
with
more
terrors
in
the
dark
but
now
little
by
little
my
joy
gave
place
to
anger
that
the
night
must
be
so
long
and
glancing
up
i
cursed
the
sun
that
it
must
needs
shine
and
the
gladsome
day
that
it
was
not
grim
night
and
presently
to
anger
was
added
a
growing
fear
lest
mine
enemy
might
by
some
hap
elude
me
at
the
eleventh
hour
might
even
now
be
slipping
from
my
reach
now
at
this
a
sweat
brake
out
on
me
and
leaping
to
my
feet
i
was
minded
to
seek
him
out
and
end
the
matter
there
and
then
why
wait
for
i
asked
myself
surely
in
the
gladsome
light
of
day
death
findeth
an
added
bitterness
why
wait
for
night
then
so
i
stood
awhile
debating
within
myself
then
catching
up
my
knotted
bludgeon
i
set
off
along
the
stream
incontinent
following
a
path
i
had
trodden
many
a
time
when
but
a
lad
a
path
that
led
on
through
mazy
thickets
shady
dells
and
green
coppices
dappled
with
sunlight
and
glad
with
the
trilling
melody
of
birds
but
ever
as
i
went
before
my
eyes
was
a
man
who
twisted
in
my
grasp
and
died
over
and
over
again
and
in
my
ears
the
sounds
of
his
agony
and
ever
as
i
went
trees
reached
out
arms
as
if
to
stay
me
and
bushes
stretched
forth
little
thorny
fingers
that
caught
my
garments
as
if
to
hinder
me
from
my
purpose
but
i
brushed
them
aside
with
my
scarred
arms
or
beat
them
down
with
my
heavy
staff
hedge
and
ditch
and
fallen
tree
until
i
reached
the
highway
and
even
as
i
came
there
a
distant
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
ten
i
quickened
my
pace
twirling
my
staff
as
i
went
so
that
the
two
or
three
wayfarers
i
chanced
to
meet
drew
from
my
neighbourhood
and
eyed
me
mightily
askance
having
gone
thus
some
mile
or
so
i
came
to
a
wall
that
bordered
the
road
a
high
and
mossy
wall
and
following
this
to
a
pair
of
gates
set
well
back
from
the
highway
with
pillars
of
stone
each
surmounted
by
a
couchant
leopard
carved
in
the
stone
now
these
gates
were
of
iron
very
lofty
and
strong
and
fast
shut
but
besides
these
was
a
smaller
gate
or
postern
of
wood
hard
by
the
gatehouse
where
stood
a
lusty
fellow
in
fair
livery
picking
his
teeth
with
a
straw
and
staring
at
the
square
toes
of
his
shoes
hearing
me
approach
he
glanced
up
and
frowning
shook
his
head
and
waved
me
away
here
no
road
for
the
likes
o
you
said
he
while
i
was
yet
at
some
distance
off
wi
you
howbeit
seeing
i
still
advanced
he
clapped
to
the
gate
and
letting
fall
the
bar
cursed
me
roundly
through
the
grille
i
would
see
sir
richard
brandon
says
i
then
ye
ca
nowise
so
be
off
and
be
danged
open
the
gate
says
i
be
hanged
for
a
rogue
a
lousy
thief
a
wastrel
and
a
hangdog
knave
says
he
all
in
a
breath
all
true
enough
says
i
and
now
open
the
gate
be
danged
for
a
prigging
gipsy
gad
i
have
ye
clapped
i
the
pillory
for
a
unbar
says
i
or
it
shall
go
plaguy
ill
wi
you
when
i
come
in
at
this
he
spat
upon
me
through
the
grille
and
chuckled
now
glancing
about
i
espied
a
stone
hard
by
about
the
bigness
of
a
man
head
and
laying
by
my
staff
i
wrenched
the
stone
from
where
it
lay
and
raising
it
aloft
hove
it
with
all
my
strength
whereon
the
gate
crashed
open
so
suddenly
as
to
catch
the
fellow
a
buffet
that
laid
him
sprawling
on
his
back
and
as
he
strove
to
rise
i
pinned
him
down
with
my
staff
and
kicked
him
heartily
and
now
says
i
up
with
you
and
bring
me
to
your
master
but
or
ever
he
could
do
aught
but
groan
and
rub
his
hurts
i
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
and
turning
beheld
a
lady
bravely
mounted
who
galloped
furiously
towards
us
down
the
avenue
when
almost
upon
us
she
swung
her
powerful
beast
aside
and
checking
him
with
strong
wrist
sat
looking
down
at
me
from
the
shade
of
her
plumed
hat
what
is
this
she
demanded
and
her
eyes
swept
over
me
grey
and
wide
and
fearless
who
who
are
you
now
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
so
rich
and
i
felt
strangely
abashed
and
finding
no
word
turned
from
her
to
scowl
down
at
the
man
i
had
pinned
beneath
my
broken
shoe
who
are
you
she
questioned
again
speak
a
rogue
says
i
keeping
my
head
averted
a
creeper
o
hedges
ah
you
said
she
in
softer
tone
i
saw
you
for
a
moment
by
near
the
gibbet
you
are
my
man
o
the
woods
and
sir
i
owe
you
much
very
much
indeed
sir
if
i
am
no
quoth
i
shortly
gregory
says
she
looking
down
on
the
fellow
my
foot
gregory
get
up
gregory
says
i
stir
not
sir
would
you
hurt
my
servant
says
she
knitting
her
slender
black
brows
i
faith
i
nodded
the
uncivil
rogue
forced
me
to
burst
open
the
gate
and
why
are
you
here
who
are
you
what
is
your
name
cried
she
a
little
breathlessly
and
i
wondered
at
the
fixed
intensity
of
her
gaze
gregory
says
i
taking
my
foot
from
his
middle
but
threatening
him
with
my
staff
i
am
come
for
no
traffic
with
maids
so
rise
up
and
bring
me
to
your
master
nay
groans
the
fellow
turning
up
his
eyes
is
thing
impossible
here
only
my
lady
and
i
seek
your
master
is
he
within
nay
says
gregory
flinching
beneath
my
staff
as
my
lady
shall
tell
he
is
not
here
ha
quoth
i
that
will
i
see
for
myself
but
as
i
turned
to
stride
up
the
avenue
my
lady
wheeled
her
horse
barring
my
way
whither
go
you
she
demanded
her
eyes
holding
mine
to
the
house
for
sir
richard
i
have
been
at
some
small
pains
to
gain
speech
with
him
to
what
end
why
truly
i
answered
leaning
upon
my
staff
and
viewing
her
eye
to
eye
is
a
matter
of
vital
moment
aye
in
a
manner
of
speaking
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
betwixt
us
now
as
i
stood
thus
i
could
not
but
be
conscious
of
her
glowing
vigorous
beauty
her
body
noble
shape
and
the
easy
grace
of
her
as
she
sat
her
fretting
horse
swaying
to
his
every
movement
and
to
me
in
my
rags
she
seemed
no
woman
but
a
goddess
rather
proud
immaculate
and
very
far
removed
and
yet
these
proud
lips
could
mayhap
grow
soft
and
tender
these
clear
eyes
that
met
mine
so
fearlessly
the
staff
was
wrenched
from
my
loosened
grasp
and
gregory
leaping
to
his
feet
fetched
me
therewith
staggering
blow
on
blow
shouting
with
his
every
stroke
ho
peter
roger
will
ho
hither
lads
all
loose
the
dogs
hither
to
me
god
name
but
though
mused
with
blows
i
rushed
in
blindly
and
closing
with
the
fellow
got
him
fairly
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
to
and
fro
and
now
was
i
minded
to
choke
him
outright
but
even
then
spied
a
cavalier
who
spurred
his
horse
against
me
hereupon
i
dashed
the
breathless
gregory
aside
and
turned
to
meet
my
new
assailant
a
spruce
young
gallant
he
from
curling
lovelock
to
spanish
boots
i
remember
cursing
savagely
as
his
whip
caught
me
then
or
ever
he
could
reach
me
again
i
sprang
in
beneath
the
head
of
his
rearing
horse
and
seizing
the
rein
close
by
the
bridle
began
to
drag
and
wrench
at
the
bit
i
heard
shouts
and
a
woman
cry
of
fear
but
i
strove
only
the
fiercer
while
up
and
up
reared
the
great
roan
horse
snorting
in
terror
his
forelegs
lashing
wildly
above
tossing
mane
the
eyes
of
his
rider
glared
down
at
me
as
laughing
exultant
i
wrenched
savagely
at
the
bridle
until
whinnying
with
pain
and
terror
the
great
beast
losing
his
balance
crashed
over
backwards
into
the
dust
leaping
clear
of
those
desperate
hooves
i
found
myself
beset
by
divers
fellows
armed
with
staves
who
closed
upon
me
shouting
and
above
these
her
eyes
wide
her
full
red
lips
my
lady
looked
down
on
me
and
i
meeting
that
look
laughed
even
as
her
fellows
rushed
at
me
go
cosset
your
pretty
springald
wench
but
even
then
dazed
and
by
a
hail
of
blows
i
staggered
sank
to
my
knees
struggled
up
again
smiting
with
bare
fists
a
flame
seemed
to
flash
before
my
eyes
a
taste
of
blood
was
on
my
tongue
and
all
sounds
grew
faint
and
far
away
as
stumbling
blindly
i
threw
up
my
arms
tripped
and
plunged
down
and
down
into
an
engulfing
darkness
and
knew
no
more
chapter
vi
of
my
shameful
sufferings
and
how
i
was
delivered
therefrom
i
awoke
with
a
sound
in
my
ears
like
the
surge
and
hiss
of
waters
a
sound
that
waxed
ever
louder
hearkening
to
this
i
presently
sought
to
move
and
wondered
vaguely
uneasy
to
find
this
impossible
i
strove
now
to
lift
my
right
hand
found
it
fast
held
tried
my
left
and
found
it
in
like
case
and
so
became
conscious
of
something
that
gripped
me
about
the
throat
and
ever
my
wonder
and
unease
grew
and
now
opening
my
eyes
the
first
thing
they
lighted
on
was
a
small
pool
of
blood
and
beyond
this
a
battered
turnip
and
beyond
this
the
carcass
of
a
dead
cat
and
beyond
this
again
a
pair
of
trim
buckled
shoes
cotton
stockings
wide
breeches
and
a
broad
belt
where
swung
a
tuck
or
rapier
prodigiously
long
of
blade
in
a
while
my
eyes
ranging
higher
yet
i
beheld
a
thin
face
scarred
from
mouth
to
eyebrow
a
brown
face
with
bright
very
quick
eyes
and
strange
ears
they
being
cut
to
points
like
a
dog
ears
now
looking
at
this
face
it
seemed
to
me
in
hazy
fashion
that
somewhere
and
at
some
time
i
had
seen
such
a
face
before
all
this
while
the
noise
i
have
likened
to
the
sea
had
been
growing
louder
so
that
i
began
to
recognise
voices
and
even
words
and
lifting
my
head
as
well
as
i
might
by
reason
of
the
thing
that
gripped
my
throat
i
saw
faces
all
about
me
they
hemmed
me
in
on
every
side
and
stretched
away
to
the
churchyard
wall
then
all
at
once
the
knowledge
of
my
situation
rushed
upon
me
i
was
in
the
pillory
huroor
be
round
cried
a
voice
time
too
shouted
a
great
strapping
fellow
near
by
is
sinful
shame
to
waste
good
on
rogue
as
knoweth
not
when
do
be
hit
he
be
a
mark
as
babe
could
miss
a
proper
big
so
saying
the
fellow
let
fly
an
egg
at
me
the
which
striking
the
board
within
an
inch
of
my
face
filled
the
air
with
suffocating
stench
this
was
a
signal
for
me
to
become
a
target
for
all
the
garbage
of
the
village
and
now
indeed
good
cause
had
i
to
be
thankful
for
my
thick
mane
of
hair
which
in
some
sort
saved
me
from
sundry
cuts
and
bruises
howbeit
my
face
was
soon
clotted
with
blood
and
filth
vain
were
it
to
tell
all
the
frenzy
of
rage
that
possessed
me
as
i
stood
thus
helpless
against
my
howling
tormentors
chief
of
whom
was
the
great
fellow
i
have
mentioned
who
by
reason
of
height
and
length
of
arm
struck
me
oftenest
once
indeed
when
beside
myself
with
fury
i
raised
my
head
to
curse
him
he
took
me
a
blow
in
the
mouth
with
some
vile
missile
that
set
my
very
gums
lord
love
ye
shipmate
that
the
spirit
said
a
voice
below
me
but
keep
the
wind
o
them
do
let
rake
ye
douse
your
lie
low
shipmate
lie
low
and
trust
to
your
comrade
adam
penfeather
and
that
me
patience
is
the
word
looking
whence
the
voice
came
i
beheld
the
man
with
whom
i
had
talked
that
morning
now
as
our
glances
met
one
of
his
bright
eyes
closed
slowly
and
nodding
twice
he
turned
and
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
small
liking
had
i
for
this
fellow
but
with
his
departure
a
sense
of
loneliness
gripped
me
and
needs
must
i
lift
my
head
to
stare
after
him
whereupon
a
rotten
egg
struck
me
above
the
eye
causing
a
most
intolerable
smart
at
this
moment
too
the
great
fellow
swung
a
cat
carcass
by
the
tail
but
or
ever
he
could
hurl
this
stinking
missile
a
hand
clouted
him
heavily
over
the
ear
from
behind
tumbling
his
hat
off
whereupon
he
turned
bellowing
with
rage
and
smote
his
nearest
neighbour
with
the
foul
thing
meant
for
me
in
an
instant
all
was
uproar
around
these
two
as
the
crowd
forgetting
me
surged
about
them
thus
for
some
while
during
which
the
fight
raged
i
was
left
unmolested
and
looked
hither
and
thither
amid
the
swaying
throng
for
this
fellow
adam
penfeather
but
he
was
vanished
quite
at
length
the
big
fellow
having
sufficiently
trounced
his
opponent
the
crowd
betook
itself
and
very
joyously
to
my
further
baiting
and
torment
now
as
i
hung
thus
in
my
shame
and
misery
faint
with
my
hurts
and
parched
with
cruel
thirst
my
gaze
lighted
upon
a
small
bony
man
a
fellow
with
wide
mouth
who
laughed
and
jested
continually
it
was
as
he
stooped
for
some
missile
or
other
that
his
eye
met
mine
and
in
that
bright
eye
methought
i
read
a
sudden
pity
o
cull
says
i
hoarsely
a
mouthful
o
water
pal
says
he
winking
all
bowmon
whereupon
he
turned
and
vanished
in
the
crowd
and
i
burning
in
a
fever
of
thirst
panted
for
his
return
straining
my
eyes
for
sight
of
him
then
as
he
came
not
i
groaned
and
drooped
my
head
and
lo
even
then
he
was
before
me
bearing
a
tin
pannikin
full
of
water
this
in
hand
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
pillory
and
despite
the
jeers
and
hootings
of
the
crowd
was
lifting
the
water
to
my
eager
lips
when
forth
leapt
the
big
fellow
and
sent
water
and
pannikin
flying
with
a
savage
blow
of
his
fist
none
o
that
peddler
he
roared
and
now
as
i
groaned
and
licked
at
bleeding
lips
with
swollen
tongue
the
little
man
turned
quick
as
a
flash
tripped
up
the
great
fellow
heels
and
staying
for
no
more
made
off
through
the
crowd
that
gave
him
passage
howling
its
acclaim
the
afternoon
dragged
wearily
on
and
what
with
the
suffocating
stench
of
the
filth
that
plastered
me
what
with
heat
and
dust
and
agonising
thirst
my
suffering
grew
almost
beyond
endurance
a
deadly
nausea
seized
me
and
i
came
nigh
to
swooning
but
now
in
this
my
great
extremity
of
a
sudden
from
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
rose
a
shrill
cry
of
fire
the
which
cry
being
taken
up
by
others
filled
the
air
with
panic
the
crowd
melted
as
if
by
magic
until
the
village
green
and
the
road
were
quite
deserted
all
this
i
noted
but
dimly
being
more
dead
than
alive
when
i
became
conscious
of
one
that
spake
in
my
ear
stand
by
shipmate
stand
by
there
never
a
rogue
left
all
run
to
the
fire
stand
by
to
slip
your
moorings
let
be
i
groaned
i
a
dead
man
then
here
that
shall
make
ye
quick
says
this
fellow
penfeather
dangling
a
great
key
before
my
swimming
eyes
here
freedom
from
your
devil
trap
and
a
plaguy
time
i
had
to
come
by
it
then
for
the
love
o
god
let
me
out
i
groaned
easy
all
shipmate
says
he
turning
the
key
upon
his
finger
for
now
here
me
a
timid
man
run
no
small
risk
this
last
and
all
for
you
now
a
bargain
a
bargain
you
agree
well
says
i
faintly
why
then
shipmate
if
i
free
ye
of
your
bonds
wilt
be
my
comrade
sworn
aye
or
no
no
says
i
plague
take
ye
that
bargain
with
dying
man
no
why
then
sighs
he
here
a
good
rick
ablaze
here
john
purdy
the
beadle
wi
his
head
broke
and
here
me
in
a
sweat
alack
and
all
to
no
purpose
since
needs
must
you
in
your
bilboes
bide
do
but
get
me
a
draft
of
water
i
pleaded
nary
a
drop
says
he
spinning
the
key
on
his
finger
under
my
nose
nor
yet
a
foaming
stoup
o
good
kentish
ale
nut
brown
ha
rogue
rogue
i
panted
parched
lips
i
yet
avenge
this
torment
an
i
live
the
legs
of
a
man
says
he
are
a
vain
thing
and
his
strength
likewise
and
as
to
vengeance
shipmate
well
how
goeth
your
vengeance
as
be
more
to
ye
than
fortune
or
riches
here
he
paused
but
i
held
my
peace
and
he
continued
here
you
now
you
that
was
so
mighty
and
fierce
aye
a
very
roarer
here
that
same
you
here
a
very
helpless
pitiful
fool
shipmate
and
thirsty
seem
here
i
groaned
again
and
one
not
over
sweet
says
he
stopping
his
nose
hereupon
i
cursed
him
though
faintly
and
he
comes
a
step
nearer
is
said
my
lady
brandon
and
her
gallant
sir
rupert
dering
him
you
overthrew
shipmate
do
mean
to
come
and
take
a
look
at
you
anon
though
is
shame
you
should
be
made
a
raree
show
burn
me
hereupon
i
fell
into
a
sudden
raging
fury
striving
so
desperately
against
my
bonds
that
the
devilish
engine
wherein
i
stood
shook
and
rattled
again
but
i
strove
to
no
purpose
and
so
presently
hung
there
spent
and
bruised
and
breathless
whiles
penfeather
spun
the
key
on
his
finger
and
sighed
shipmate
says
he
wherefore
irk
yourself
wi
bonds
say
but
the
word
and
i
deliver
ye
bring
ye
to
safe
harbourage
and
cherish
ye
with
much
good
ale
be
persuaded
now
why
then
groans
i
give
me
but
until
to
do
what
i
will
and
i
yours
done
says
he
and
forthwith
set
key
to
padlock
but
scarce
had
he
freed
the
than
he
falls
his
breath
easy
comrade
easy
quoth
he
softly
bide
still
awhile
hither
cometh
yon
beefy
fool
back
again
so
will
i
make
show
of
miscalling
ye
till
he
be
gone
the
which
he
did
forthwith
giving
me
scurvy
rogue
and
the
like
now
lifting
my
head
whom
should
i
behold
but
that
same
tall
fellow
had
been
my
chief
tormenter
and
who
now
hasted
over
the
green
towards
us
it
be
but
farmer
darrell
rick
ablaze
says
he
to
penfeather
so
let
burn
says
i
farmer
darrell
be
no
friend
o
mine
so
i
be
come
to
sport
wi
yon
big
rogue
awhile
herewith
he
stooped
for
some
missile
to
cast
at
me
but
now
i
straightened
my
back
the
gave
and
ere
the
fellow
was
aware
i
was
creeping
swiftly
upon
him
taken
thus
by
surprise
small
chance
had
he
for
leaping
on
him
i
bore
him
over
on
his
back
and
kneeling
on
him
buried
my
fingers
in
his
throat
and
so
i
choked
him
right
joyfully
till
penfeather
gripped
my
arm
lord
love
me
cries
he
will
ye
kill
the
fool
that
will
i
and
hang
for
him
nay
he
scarce
worth
it
then
devil
burn
ye
loose
his
windpipe
so
i
loosed
the
throat
and
despite
his
feeble
kicks
began
to
drag
him
over
the
grass
what
now
comrade
says
penfeather
sink
me
what
now
watch
and
see
so
i
brought
the
fellow
to
the
pillory
wherein
i
set
him
and
plucking
the
key
from
penfeather
locked
him
there
in
my
stead
which
done
i
kicked
him
once
or
twice
and
having
found
the
cat
carcass
made
shift
to
hang
the
stinking
thing
about
his
neck
then
tossing
the
key
into
the
pond
i
took
to
my
heels
and
left
the
fellow
groaning
mighty
dismal
chapter
vii
how
i
heard
tell
of
black
bartlemy
treasure
now
scarce
was
i
clear
of
the
village
than
i
was
again
seized
of
a
deadly
sickness
and
vertigo
so
that
i
stumbled
and
was
like
to
fall
but
that
penfeather
propped
me
with
his
shoulder
in
this
fashion
i
made
shift
to
drag
myself
along
nor
would
he
suffer
me
stay
or
respite
maugre
my
weakness
until
following
the
brook
he
had
brought
me
into
the
green
solitude
of
the
woods
here
then
i
sank
down
sucking
up
the
cool
sweet
water
parched
lips
drinking
until
penfeather
stayed
me
lest
i
should
do
myself
hurt
thereby
thereafter
from
strength
reviving
i
bathed
my
divers
wounds
the
which
though
painful
were
of
small
account
and
fell
to
cleansing
my
spattered
garments
as
well
as
i
might
so
we
to
be
comrades
after
all
says
penfeather
watching
me
where
he
sat
hard
by
aye
and
how
goeth
vengeance
shipmate
at
this
i
turned
on
him
with
clenched
fist
nay
easy
does
it
says
he
never
budging
for
if
the
folly
of
vengeance
brought
ye
in
the
peccadille
was
your
comrade
adam
penfeather
got
ye
out
again
so
easy
all
was
you
fired
the
rick
then
none
other
is
a
hanging
matter
i
heard
why
a
man
must
needs
run
some
small
risk
for
his
comrade
d
see
then
adam
penfeather
i
your
debtor
nay
says
he
there
be
no
debts
comrades
o
the
brotherhood
give
and
take
share
and
share
and
speaking
he
drew
forth
a
purse
and
emptying
store
of
money
on
the
grass
betwixt
us
divided
it
equally
and
pushed
a
pile
of
silver
and
copper
towards
me
and
what
this
i
demanded
share
and
share
comrade
but
i
no
comrade
o
yours
till
after
aha
says
he
pinching
his
long
chin
more
vengeance
then
keep
your
money
till
it
be
earned
i
muttered
sink
me
and
there
pride
for
ye
says
he
pride
which
is
a
vain
thing
and
vengeance
which
is
a
vainer
lord
love
me
shipmate
is
plain
to
see
you
o
the
quality
your
rags
blue
blood
noblesse
oblige
and
all
the
rest
o
stint
your
gab
says
i
scowling
is
writ
large
all
over
ye
he
went
on
placidly
enough
as
for
me
i
but
a
plain
man
wi
no
time
for
vengeance
and
no
whit
o
pride
about
me
anywhere
what
i
says
to
you
is
get
to
vengeance
nay
heave
it
overboard
shipmate
and
you
ride
the
easier
aye
and
sweeter
and
seek
something
more
useful
gold
for
instance
is
a
handy
thing
i
heard
say
so
ha
done
vengeance
no
says
i
frowning
not
nay
not
for
all
bartlemy
treasure
aha
quoth
he
softly
so
you
heard
tell
of
it
then
along
the
spanish
main
i
heard
tell
of
it
last
night
in
a
cave
from
a
how
says
he
starting
and
with
keen
eyes
glancing
hither
and
thither
a
hereabouts
damme
says
i
the
country
seems
thick
o
ha
d
say
so
and
what
like
was
this
one
a
comely
rogue
that
sang
strange
song
ah
said
penfeather
his
eyes
narrowing
a
song
says
you
and
strange
how
strange
was
all
of
dead
men
and
murder
d
mind
any
line
shipmate
aye
the
words
of
it
went
somewhat
like
this
on
a
knife
did
part
wi
life
and
some
a
bullet
took
o
but
now
here
as
i
stopped
at
a
loss
my
companion
took
up
the
rhyme
almost
unconsciously
and
below
his
breath
three
times
three
died
plaguily
a
wriggling
on
a
hook
o
comrade
says
he
in
the
same
low
voice
did
ye
see
ever
among
these
mariners
a
man
a
tall
man
wi
a
hook
in
place
of
his
left
hand
a
very
bright
sharp
hook
and
now
as
penfeather
questioned
me
he
seized
my
wrist
and
i
was
amazed
at
the
iron
grip
of
him
no
i
answered
nay
says
he
loosing
his
hold
how
should
you
he
dead
along
so
many
on
he
done
for
him
and
his
hook
devil
burn
him
hook
both
long
and
stout
and
strong
they
died
by
gash
o
hook
o
ah
i
cried
so
that
was
the
kind
of
hook
aye
nodded
penfeather
that
was
the
kind
a
bullet
bad
a
knife
worse
but
a
steel
hook
shipmate
very
sharp
d
see
is
a
death
no
man
should
die
shipmate
i
seen
divers
men
dead
by
that
same
hook
torn
and
ripped
d
see
like
a
dog
fangs
i
seen
many
die
ere
then
but
that
way
was
an
ill
sight
for
queasy
stomachs
and
he
this
man
with
the
hook
is
dead
you
say
and
burning
in
are
you
sure
i
killed
him
shipmate
you
says
i
i
shipmate
we
fought
on
a
shelf
o
rock
high
above
the
sea
my
knife
agin
his
knife
and
hook
was
that
same
hook
gave
me
this
scar
athwart
my
jaw
but
as
he
struck
i
struck
and
saw
him
go
spinning
over
and
over
down
and
down
and
splash
into
the
sea
and
for
three
days
i
watched
that
bit
o
shore
living
on
and
watching
for
him
to
make
sure
i
had
finished
him
at
last
and
these
other
rogues
says
i
what
like
were
they
shipmate
hereupon
i
described
as
fully
as
i
might
the
three
i
had
fought
with
in
the
albeit
i
made
no
mention
of
the
maid
while
penfeather
listened
nodding
now
and
then
and
pinching
at
his
long
chin
and
this
other
fellow
says
he
when
i
had
done
this
fellow
that
sang
d
know
if
his
name
chanced
to
be
mings
abnegation
mings
comrade
the
very
same
says
i
strange
quoth
penfeather
and
thereafter
sat
staring
gloomily
down
into
the
rippling
waters
of
the
brook
for
a
while
i
wonder
says
he
at
last
i
wonder
what
think
ye
shall
bring
these
fellows
so
far
from
the
coast
what
should
they
be
after
me
shipmate
you
says
i
for
the
second
time
marvelling
at
the
strange
quiet
of
him
and
what
would
they
have
of
you
my
life
shipmate
and
one
other
thing
what
that
thing
is
i
will
tell
you
when
we
have
drunk
the
but
now
it
behoveth
me
to
be
so
i
away
but
when
you
shall
seek
me
as
seek
me
ye
will
shipmate
shalt
hear
of
me
at
the
tavern
which
is
a
small
quiet
place
here
and

or
night
and
say
faithful
friend
and
you
shall
find

you
can
choose
your
time

better
so
saying
he
arose
wait
says
i
pointing
to
the
coins
yet
lying
on
the
grass
take
your
money
is
none
o
mine
says
he
shaking
his
head
keep
it
or
throw
it
away
is
all
one
to
me
then
he
went
away
through
the
wood
and
as
he
went
i
thought
he
walked
with
a
new
and
added
caution
chapter
viii
how
i
fell
in
with
one
a
peddler
evening
was
at
hand
as
i
reached
a
little
alehouse
well
away
from
the
road
and
pleasantly
secluded
by
trees
thither
came
i
fondling
penfeather
money
in
my
pocket
for
i
was
again
mightily
sharp
set
but
all
at
once
i
stopped
for
passing
the
open
lattice
i
heard
loud
laughter
and
a
merry
voice
and
there
believe
me
gossips
quoth
this
voice
as
sure
as
this
be
beef
aye
and
good
beef
and
cooked
to
a
turn
mistress
this
great
hectoring
tom
button
fast
i
the
pillory
and
by
this
good
ale
a
woeful
sight
his
eyes
blacked
his
nose
his
jerkin
torn
and
a
dead
cat
about
his
neck
oho
aha
tom
button
big
tom
fighting
tom
so
loud
o
tongue
and
ready
o
fist
tom
as
have
cowed
so
many
there
is
he
fast
by
the
neck
and
see
ye
gossips
loud
enough
for
six
wish
i
may
die
else
and
the
best
the
joke
is
the
key
be
gone
as
i
a
sinner
so
they
needs
must
break
the
lock
to
get
him
out
big
tom
as
have
thrashed
every
man
for
miles
but
here
merry
voice
and
laughter
ceased
and
a
buxom
woman
thrust
smiling
face
from
the
window
and
face
like
her
voice
was
kindly
when
she
addressed
me
what
would
ye
young
master
a
little
food
mistress
says
i
touching
my
hat
and
pulling
it
lower
over
my
bruised
and
swollen
features
why
come
in
master
come
in
there
be
none
here
but
my
roger
and
godby
the
peddler
as
knoweth
everyone
so
i
entered
forthwith
a
small
snug
chamber
and
seating
myself
in
the
darkest
corner
acknowledged
the
salutations
of
the
two
men
while
the
woman
bustling
to
and
fro
soon
set
before
me
a
fine
joint
of
roast
beef
with
bread
and
ale
upon
which
i
incontinent
fell
to
the
two
men
sat
cheek
by
jowl
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
one
a
lusty
fellow
the
other
a
small
bony
man
who
laughed
and
ate
and
ate
and
laughed
and
yet
contrived
to
talk
all
the
while
that
it
was
a
wonder
to
behold
was
you
over
to
lamberhurst
way

says
he
to
me
all
at
once

with

i

happened
to
be
that
same
rogue
here
roger
the
landlord
stared
his
buxom
wife
shrank
away
and
even
the
talkative
peddler
grew
silent
awhile
viewing
me
with
his
shrewd
merry
eyes
aha

he
at
last

he
questioned
his
bright
eyes
all
of
a
twinkle
how
so
my
bully
boy
that
pannikin
of
water
which
you
did
get
my
lad

table

a
goodly
thing

that
true
o

the
buxom
cicely
and
ye
find
no
better
brew
than
our
own
quoth
roger
and
that
i
swear
to
laughed
the
peddler
cram
me
wi
spiders
else
so
the
good
ale
was
brought
and
godby
lifting
his
tankard
smiled
and
nodded
over
the
creamy
foam
here
a
griping
colic
to
every
catchpoll
and
the
like
vermin
this
and
london
town
says
he
and
lifted
the
ale
to
his
lips
but
suddenly
he
sat
it
down
untasted
and
rose
friends
took
quoth
he
see
yonder
as
he
spake
the
narrow
doorway
was
darkened
and
two
rough
fellows
entered
and
each
bore
a
formidable
bludgeon

one
a
big

and
a
month
in
maidstone
jail
and
that
what
and
enough
too
growled
roger
the
landlord
clenching
hairy
fist
and
glancing
furtively
towards
a
rusty
sword
suspended
above
the
hearth
let
be
roger
i
a
lamb
sighed
the
peddler
and
i
would
you
in
trouble
by
me
besides
this
room
o
yourn
though
snug
fit
for
struggling
nor
striving
so
friends
then
he
turned
away
between
his
two
captors
but
as
he
did
so
his
bright
eyes
for
one
moment
met
mine
and
in
his
look
i
read
appeal
now
scarce
were
they
gone
when
i
got
me
to
my
feet
whereat
the
landlord
roger
did
the
like
what
to
do
he
questioned
glancing
yearningly
from
me
to
the
rusty
sword
why
now
says
i
counting
out
my
reckoning
bide
you
here
for
your
good
wife
sake
aye
do
now
roger
she
pleaded
be
ruination
to
us
moreover
says
i
reaching
for
my
cudgel
they
are
but
two
so
bide
you
here
then
i
stepped
forth
of
the
tavern
and
very
soon
came
up
with
the
two
fellows
their
prisoner
walking
betwixt
them
meekly
enough
but
as
i
approached
they
halted
all
three
and
what
be
you
after
demanded
the
surly
fellow
you
and
what
d
want
of
us
hey
your
prisoner

and
what
for
him
i
a
mind
to
him
o

be
curst
for
a
black
ugly
rogue
that
no
answer
is
all
you
get
o
we
save
knocks
says
the
man
spitting
in
his
hand
and
taking
firm
grip
of
his
bludgeon
why
then
i
must
take
him
says
i
try
and
be
damned
roared
the
fellow
ha
look
alive
jem
and
whirling
up
his
staff
he
made
at
me
amain
but
i
sprang
aside
and
as
his
rush
carried
him
past
my
answering
stroke
caught
him
fairly
wrist
and
elbow
and
his
cudgel
spun
harmlessly
into
the
hedge
breathing
curses
he
sought
to
close
with
me
but
i
keeping
my
distance
smote
him
very
blithely
how
and
where
i
would
until
he
his
arm
useless
misliking
my
and
reading
no
mercy
in
my
look
very
wisely
betook
him
to
his
heels
hereupon
i
turned
to
find
the
little
peddler
sitting
astride
his
man
neck
and
his
fist
against
the
fellow
nose
smell
it
job
he
was
saying

the
fist
of
a

old

and
all
along
o

good
old

ye
so
the
fellow
got
him
to
his
legs
mighty
rueful
and
sped
away
after
his
comrade
pal
says
the
little
peddler
reaching
out
and
grasping
my
hand
here
full
quittance
for
that
pannikin
o
water
as
you
never

and
now
what

quoth
the
peddler
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
wi
all
my
heart
thus
we
presently
returned
to
the
little
tavern
and
found
there
roger
the
landlord
the
rusty
sword
in
one
brawny
fist
his
wife
holding
fast
to
the
other
at
sight
of
us
he
dropped
the
weapon
and
roared
joyously
and
cicely
running
to
us
clasped
our
hands
in
hearty
welcome

sat
down

four
and

ashore

the
more
i
saw
of
this
little
peddler
the
better
i
liked
him
so
that
the
hour
was
late
when
having
supped
excellently
well
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
if
you
must
be
away
young
master

buxom

nodded
the

likewise
a
pipkin
of
ale
and
a
bite
and
all
gratus
to
a
pal
and
look
martin
my

quoth
the
peddler
grasping
my
hand
there

ever
and
always
the
good
leading
on
and
away
to
better
things
so
happen
ye
should
change
your
mind

and

to
sail
with
me
go
to
the
at
bedgbury
cross
the
word
is
faithful
friend
and
ask
for
adam
penfeather
so
i
presently
stepped
forth
of
the
little
tavern
where
i
had
found
such
kindliness
and
turning
from
the
narrow
lane
struck
off
across
the
fields
it
was
a
sweet
warm
night
the
moon
not
up
as
yet
thus
as
i
went
i
lifted
my
gaze
to
the
heavens
where
stars
made
a
glory
and
beholding
these
wondrous
fires
i
needs
must
recall
the
little
peddler
saying
and
ponder
his
good
times
his
times
of
stars
and
birds
of
noon
and
eventide
of
welcomes
sweet
and
eyes
of
love
and
now
i
was
of
a
sudden
filled
with
a
great
yearning
and
passionate
desire
that
i
too
might
know
such
times
but
as
i
climbed
a
stile
my
hand
by
chance
came
upon
the
knife
at
my
girdle
and
sitting
on
the
stile
i
drew
it
forth
and
fell
to
handling
its
broad
blade
and
doing
so
knew
in
my
heart
that
such
times
were
not
for
me
nor
ever
could
be
and
sitting
there
knife
in
hand
desire
and
yearning
were
lost
and
in
fierce
and
black
despair
chapter
ix
how
i
had
word
with
the
lady
joan
brandon
for
the
third
time
the
moon
was
well
up
when
striking
out
from
the
gloom
of
the
woods
i
reached
a
wall
very
high
and
strong
whereon
moss
and
lichens
grew
skirting
this
i
presently
espied
that
i
sought
a
place
where
the
coping
was
gone
with
sundry
of
the
bricks
making
here
a
gap
very
apt
to
escalade
and
here
years
agone
i
had
been
wont
to
climb
this
wall
to
the
furtherance
of
some
boyish
prank
on
many
a
night
such
as
this
awhile
stood
i
staring
up
at
this
gap
then
seizing
hold
of
massy
brickwork
i
drew
myself
up
and
dropped
into
a
walled
garden
here
were
beds
of
herbs
well
tended
and
orderly
and
as
i
went
i
breathed
an
air
sweet
with
the
smell
of
thyme
and
lavender
and
a
thousand
other
scents
an
air
fraught
with
memories
of
sunny
days
and
joyous
youth
insomuch
that
i
clenched
my
hands
and
hasted
from
the
place
past
sombre
trees
mighty
of
girth
and
branch
i
hurried
past
still
pools
full
of
a
moony
radiance
where
lilies
floated
past
marble
fauns
and
dryads
that
peeped
from
leafy
solitudes
past
sundial
and
carven
bench
by
clipped
and
winding
walks
until
screened
in
shadow
i
paused
to
look
upon
a
great
and
goodly
house
and
as
i
stood
there
viewing
it
over
from
to
gabled
roof
i
heard
a
distant
clock
chime
ten
the
great
house
lay
very
silent
and
dark
not
a
light
showed
save
in
one
lower
chamber
so
i
waited
patiently
my
gaze
on
this
light
while
ever
and
anon
the
leaves
about
me
stirred
in
the
soft
with
a
sound
like
one
that
sighed
mournfully
thus
stayed
i
some
while
howbeit
the
light
yet
aglow
and
my
patience
waning
i
stole
forward
keeping
ever
in
the
shadows
and
ascending
the
terrace
came
where
grew
ivy
very
thick
and
gnarled
overspreading
this
wing
of
the
house
groping
amid
the
leaves
i
found
that
i
sought
a
stout
staple
between
the
bricks
with
above
this
another
and
yet
other
again
the
which
formed
a
sort
of
ladder
whereby
as
a
boy
i
had
been
wont
to
come
and
go
by
night
or
day
as
i
listed
forthwith
i
began
to
climb
by
means
of
these
staples
and
the
ivy
until
at
last
my
fingers
grasped
the
stone
sill
of
a
window
and
now
the
lattice
being
open
i
contrived
albeit
it
with
much
ado
to
clamber
into
the
room
it
was
a
chamber
and
the
moonlight
falling
athwart
the
floor
lit
upon
a
great
carven
bed
brave
with
tapestried
hangings
just
now
the
silken
curtains
were
and
upon
the
bed
i
saw
a
bundle
of
garments
all
ribands
laces
and
the
like
the
which
of
themselves
gave
me
sudden
pause
from
these
my
gaze
wandered
to
where
against
the
panelling
hung
a
goodly
rapier
complete
with
girdle
and
slings
its
silver
hilt
its
guards
and
curling
quillons
bright
in
the
moonbeams
so
came
i
and
reaching
it
down
drew
it
from
the
scabbard
and
saw
the
blade
very
bright
as
it
had
been
well
cared
for
and
graven
on
the
forte
of
the
blade
was
the
conisby
blazon
and
the
legend
rouse
me
not
now
as
i
stood
watching
the
moonbeams
play
up
and
down
the
long
blade
i
heard
the
light
quick
tread
of
feet
ascending
the
stairs
without
and
a
voice
very
rich
and
sweetly
melodious
that
brake
out
and
the
words
it
sang
these
a
poor
soul
sat
sighing
by
a
green
willow
tree
with
hand
on
his
bosom
his
head
on
his
knee
sighing
willow
willow
willow
o
willow
willow
willow
and
o
the
green
willow
my
garland
shall
be
nearer
came
the
singing
while
i
stood
sword
in
hand
waiting
the
song
ended
suddenly
and
the
sweet
voice
called
o
marjorie
wake
me
betimes
i
must
be
abroad
with
the
sun
sweet
wench
i
crouched
in
the
curtains
of
the
great
bed
as
the
latch
clicked
and
the
room
filled
with
the
soft
glow
of
a
candle
a
moment
silence
then
o
marjorie
i
wear
the
green
taffety
in
the
morning
nay
indeed
i
be
my
own
tirewoman
the
light
was
borne
across
the
room
then
coming
softly
to
the
door
i
closed
it
and
setting
my
back
against
it
leaned
there
at
the
small
sound
i
made
she
turned
and
beholding
me
shrank
back
and
i
saw
the
candlestick
shaking
in
her
hand
ere
she
set
it
down
upon
the
carved
press
beside
her
who
is
it
who
is
it
she
questioned
breathlessly
staring
at
my
bruised
and
swollen
features
a
rogue
you
had
dragged
lifeless
to
the
pillory
you
she
breathed
you
and
they
set
you
in
the
pillory
was
by
no
order
of
me
is
no
matter
lady
here
was
just
reward
for
a
rogue
says
i
but
now
i
seek
sir
richard
nay
indeed
indeed
you
shall
not
find
him
here
that
will
i
prove
for
myself
says
i
and
laid
hand
on
latch
sir
says
she
in
the
same
breathless
fashion
why
will
you
not
believe
me
seek
him
an
you
will
but
i
tell
you
sir
richard
sailed
into
the
spanish
main
two
years
since
and
was
lost
lost
says
i
feeling
a
tremor
of
apprehension
shake
me
as
i
met
her
truthful
eyes
lost
say
you
how
lost
he
and
his
ship
were
taken
by
the
spaniards
off
hispaniola
taken
i
repeated
like
one
sore
mazed
taken
off
hispaniola
and
here
bethinking
me
of
the
cruel
mockery
of
it
all
should
this
indeed
be
so
black
anger
seized
me
you
lie
to
me
i
cried
ha
by
god
you
lie
an
there
be
aught
of
justice
in
heaven
then
richard
brandon
must
be
here
who
are
you
she
questioned
viewing
me
with
the
same
stare
who
are
you
so
fierce
so
young
yet
with
whitened
hair
and
that
trembles
at
the
truth
who
are
you
speak
you
have
lied
to
save
him
from
me
i
cried
you
lie
ha
confess
and
i
strode
towards
her
the
long
blade
in
my
quivering
grasp
would
you
kill
me
says
she
all
unflinching
and
with
eyes
that
never
wavered
would
you
murder
a
helpless
maid
martin
conisby
the
rapier
fell
to
the
rug
at
my
feet
and
lay
there
my
breath
caught
and
thus
we
stood
awhile
staring
into
each
other
eyes
martin
conisby
is
dead
says
i
at
last
for
answer
she
pointed
to
the
wall
above
my
head
and
looking
thither
i
saw
the
picture
of
a
young
cavalier
richly
habited
who
smiled
down
and
all
youth
and
gaiety
and
beneath
this
portrait
ran
the
words
martin
conisby
lord
wendover
aetat
madam
quoth
i
at
last
turning
my
back
on
the
picture
yon
innocent
was
whipped
to
death
aboard
a
spanish
galleass
years
since
wherefore
i
a
poor
rogue
come
seeking
his
destroyer
sir
says
she
clasping
her
hands
and
viewing
me
with
troubled
eyes
o
sir
whom
mean
you
one
who
having
slain
the
father
sold
the
son
into
slavery
to
the
hell
of
spanish
dungeon
and
to
stripes
and
shame
and
torment
one
the
just
god
hath
promised
to
my
vengeance
i
mean
richard
brandon
ah
mercy
of
god
my
father
ah
no
no
it
can
not
be
my
father
sure
here
is
some
black
mistake
being
his
daughter
you
should
know
is
very
truth
being
a
brandon
you
must
know
of
the
feud
hath
cursed
and
rent
our
families
time
out
of
mind
the
bitter
faction
and
bloodshed
aye
she
murmured
this
i
do
know
well
madam
five
years
agone
or
thereabouts
my
father
falsely
attainted
of
treason
died
in
his
prison
and
i
drugged
and
trepanned
aboard
ship
was
sold
into
the
plantations
whence
few
return
and
richard
brandon
enriched
by
our
loss
and
great
at
court
dreamed
he
had
made
an
end
o
the
conisbys
and
that
the
feud
was
ended
once
and
for
all
my
lord
says
she
proud
head
upflung
i
deny
all
this
such
suspicion
so
base
and
unfounded
shameth
but
yourself
you
have
dared
force
your
way
into
my
house
at
dead
of
night
and
now
o
now
you
would
traduce
my
absent
father
charging
him
with
shameful
crimes
and
this
to
me
his
daughter
enough
i
hear
no
more
begone
ere
i
summon
my
servants
and
have
you
driven
forth
and
seizing
the
that
hung
against
the
panelling
she
faced
me
her
deep
bosom
heaving
tempestuous
white
hands
clenched
and
scorning
me
with
her
eyes
ring
says
i
and
seated
myself
in
a
chair
beside
her
great
bed
have
you
no
shame
none
madam
was
all
whipped
out
o
me
aboard
the
galleass
ring
madam
but
i
go
not
till
i
learn
once
and
for
all
if
sir
richard
be
here
or
no
now
at
this
she
loosed
the
very
suddenly
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
stood
thus
awhile
god
pity
me
says
she
at
last
in
weeping
voice
i
may
not
forget
how
you
saved
me
from
here
a
tremor
seemed
to
shake
her
then
she
spake
again
yet
now
scarce
above
a
whisper
your
face
hath
looked
upon
me
night
and
morn
these
two
years
and
now
o
martin
conisby
were
you
but
the
man
i
dreamed
you
i
a
rogue
from
slavery
says
i
aye
she
cried
suddenly
lifting
her
head
and
viewing
me
with
new
and
bitter
scorn
and
one
that
speaketh
lies
of
an
absent
man
lies
quoth
i
choking
on
the
word
lies
madam
why
then
how
cometh
my
picture
here
my
coat
of
arms
above
the
mantel
yonder
the
conisby
on
your
gates
what
do
you
at
conisby
shene
now
in
her
look
i
saw
a
sudden
doubt
a
growing
dread
her
breath
caught
and
she
shrank
back
to
the
panelled
wall
and
leaned
there
and
ever
the
trouble
in
her
eyes
grew
well
my
lady
i
questioned
have
ye
no
answer
was
said
i
have
heard
the
conisbys
were
no
more
even
so
how
came
sir
richard
by
this
our
house
nay
nay
i
i
know
little
of
my
father
business
he
was
ever
a
silent
man
and
i
have
passed
my
days
in
london
or
abroad
but
you
ah
tell
me
why
seek
you
my
father
that
is
betwixt
him
and
me
was
it
murder
was
it
vengeance
my
lord
here
as
i
made
no
answer
she
crosses
over
to
me
and
lays
one
slender
hand
on
my
shoulder
whereat
i
would
have
risen
but
her
touch
stayed
me
speak
says
she
in
a
whisper
was
it
his
life
you
sought
meeting
the
look
in
her
deep
soft
eyes
i
was
silent
for
a
while
finding
no
word
then
dumbly
i
nodded
and
now
i
felt
her
hand
trembling
on
my
shoulder
ere
it
was
withdrawn
and
looking
up
i
saw
she
had
clasped
her
hands
and
stood
with
head
bowed
like
one
in
prayer
o
martin
conisby
she
whispered
now
thank
god
that
in
his
mercy
he
hath
stayed
thee
from
murder
so
she
stood
awhile
then
crossing
to
the
carven
press
took
thence
divers
papers
and
set
them
before
me
read
she
commanded
so
i
examined
these
papers
and
found
therein
indisputable
evidence
that
my
journey
here
was
vain
indeed
that
sir
richard
sailing
westward
had
been
taken
by
spaniards
off
hispaniola
and
carried
away
prisoner
none
knew
whither
and
in
a
while
having
read
these
papers
i
laid
them
by
and
rising
stumbled
towards
the
open
casement
well
my
lord
says
she
in
strange
breathless
fashion
and
what
now
why
now
says
i
wearily
it
seems
my
vengeance
is
yet
to
seek
vengeance
she
cried
ah
god
pity
thee
doth
life
hold
for
thee
nought
better
nought
vengeance
is
a
consuming
fire
so
seek
i
vengeance
o
martin
conisby
bethink
you
vengeance
is
but
a
sickness
of
the
mind
a
wasting
disease
so
seek
i
vengeance
for
him
that
questeth
after
vengeance
this
fair
world
can
hold
nought
beside
so
give
me
vengeance
nought
else
seek
i
of
this
world
ah
poor
soul
poor
man
that
might
be
so
do
i
pity
thee
i
seek
no
man
pity
but
i
am
a
woman
so
shall
i
pity
thee
alway
now
as
i
prepared
to
climb
through
the
lattice
she
beholding
the
sword
where
it
yet
lay
stooped
and
taking
it
up
sheathed
it
this
was
thine
own
once
i
heard
says
she
take
it
martin
conisby
keep
it
clean
free
from
dishonour
and
leave
thy
vengeance
to
god
not
so
says
i
shaking
my
head
i
have
my
knife
is
weapon
better
suited
to
my
rags
so
saying
i
clambered
out
through
the
lattice
even
as
i
had
come
being
upon
the
terrace
i
glanced
up
to
find
her
leaning
to
watch
me
and
with
the
moon
bright
on
her
face
live
you
for
nought
but
vengeance
she
questioned
softly
so
aid
me
god
says
i
so
shall
i
pity
thee
alway
martin
conisby
she
repeated
and
sighed
and
so
was
gone
then
i
turned
slow
of
foot
and
went
my
solitary
way
chapter
x
how
i
swore
to
the
i
remember
the
moon
was
very
bright
as
reaching
the
end
of
a
grassy
lane
or
rather
i
saw
before
me
a
small
tavern
with
a
board
over
the
door
whereon
were
the
words
ye
peck
of
malt
by
joel
bym
and
looking
the
place
over
from
trim
white
steps
before
the
door
to
trim
thatched
roof
i
marvelled
at
its
air
of
prosperity
for
here
it
stood
so
far
removed
from
road
and
so
apparently
away
from
all
habitation
and
so
lost
and
hid
by
trees
it
standing
within
a
little
copse
that
it
was
great
wonder
any
customer
should
ever
find
his
way
hither
the
place
was
very
quiet
not
a
light
showed
anywhere
and
the
door
was
fast
shut
which
was
nothing
strange
for
the
hour
was
late
stepping
up
to
the
door
i
knocked
loudly
thereon
with
my
cudgel
at
first
without
effect
but
having
repeated
the
summons
a
voice
from
within
hailed
me
gruffly
who
knocks
faithful
friend
says
i
at
this
the
door
swung
suddenly
open
and
a
lanthorn
was
thrust
into
my
face
whereupon
i
fell
back
a
step
dazzled
then
gradually
beyond
this
glare
i
made
out
a
dark
shape
blocking
the
doorway
a
great
fellow
so
prodigiously
hairy
of
head
and
face
that
little
was
there
to
see
of
features
save
two
round
eyes
and
a
great
hooked
nose
and
who
d
seek
faithful
friend
says
he
master
adam
penfeather
why
then
faithful
friend
heave
ahead
says
he
and
making
way
for
me
to
enter
closed
the
door
the
which
i
noticed
was
mighty
stout
and
strong
and
having
locked
and
bolted
it
barred
it
with
a
stout
iron
set
into
massy
sockets
in
either
wall
you
go
mighty
secure
says
i
cock
quoth
the
giant
eyeing
me
over
slowly
cock
be
ye
a
cackler
because
if
so
be
you
do
cackle
overly
here
we
as
wo
love
ye
no
whit
my
cock
good
says
i
returning
his
look
i
seek
no
man
love
cock
quoth
he
plunging
huge
fist
into
his
beard
and
giving
it
a
tug
i
begin
to
love
ye
better
nor
i
thought
this
way
cock
herewith
he
led
me
along
a
wide
flagged
passage
and
up
a
broad
stair
with
massy
carven
handrail
and
as
i
went
i
saw
the
place
was
much
bigger
than
i
had
deemed
it
the
walls
too
were
panelled
and
i
judged
it
had
once
formed
part
of
a
noble
house
at
last
we
reached
a
door
whereon
the
fellow
knocked
softly
and
so
presently
ushered
me
into
a
fair
chamber
lit
by
wax
candles
and
here
seated
at
a
table
with
papers
before
him
and
a
pen
in
his
fingers
sat
master
adam
penfeather
ha
shipmate
says
he
motioning
to
a
chair
you
be
something
earlier
than
i
expected
suffer
me
to
make
an
end
o
this
business
sit
ye
comrade
sit
as
for
you
have
up
a
flask
the
spanish
wine
the
black
seal
aye
says
he
and
seizing
a
fistful
of
hair
above
his
eyebrow
strode
away
closing
the
door
behind
him
now
beholding
penfeather
as
he
bent
to
his
writing
the
lean
aquiline
face
of
him
so
smooth
and
youthful
in
contrast
to
his
silver
hair
i
was
struck
by
his
changed
look
indeed
he
seemed
some
bookish
student
rather
than
the
lawless
rover
i
had
thought
him
despite
the
pistols
at
his
elbow
and
the
long
rapier
that
dangled
at
his
moreover
there
was
about
him
also
an
air
of
latent
power
i
had
not
noticed
ere
this
at
length
having
made
an
end
of
his
writing
he
got
up
and
stretched
himself
so
shipmate
art
ready
to
swear
the
wi
me
aye
says
i
when
do
we
sail
at
this
he
glanced
at
me
swiftly
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
so
ho
he
murmured
pinching
his
chin
the
wind
changed
it
seems
you
grow
eager
and
wherefore
is
no
matter
shipmate
says
he
shaking
his
head
an
we
sail
as
brothers
and
comrades
there
must
be
never
a
secret
betwixt
us
speak
as
ye
will
quoth
i
leaning
back
in
my
chair
i
learn
then
you
are
sailing
as
master
in
a
ship
bound
for
the
main
in
quest
of
sir
richard
brandon
lost
off
hispaniola
two
years
agone
sir
richard
brandon
is
the
man
i
have
sought
ever
since
i
broke
out
of
the
hell
he
sold
me
into
now
adam
penfeather
says
i
springing
to
my
feet
and
grasping
his
arm
now
put
me
in
the
way
of
meeting
this
man
aid
me
to
get
my
hand
on
this
man
and
i
am
yours
aye
body
and
soul
to
the
end
o
things
and
this
i
swear
while
i
spake
thus
my
voice
hoarse
with
passion
my
fingers
clutching
his
arm
penfeather
stood
pinching
his
chin
and
watching
me
beneath
his
black
brows
when
i
had
ended
he
turned
and
falls
to
and
fro
across
the
room
as
it
had
been
the
narrow
poop
of
a
ship
ah
i
know
you
now
my
lord
says
he
pausing
suddenly
before
me
as
the
who
watched
you
as
you
lay
in
your
sleep
outside
the
conisby
arms
i
guessed
you
one
o
the
conisby
breed
by
your
ring
and
as
one
born
and
bred
here
in
kent
i
mind
well
the
adage
hate
like
a
brandon
and
revenge
like
a
conisby
and
by
god
my
lord
you
are
a
true
conisby
it
seemeth
vengeance
says
he
his
thin
features
grown
sharp
and
austere
ah
i
have
seen
much
and
overmuch
of
it
aboard
lawless
craft
and
among
the
wild
islands
of
the
caribbees
i
have
seen
the
devilish
cruelties
of
spaniard
portugal
and
the
red
horrors
of
indian
vengeance
but
for
cold
merciless
ferocity
for
the
vengeance
that
dieth
not
biding
its
time
and
battening
on
poisonous
hate
it
needeth
your
man
o
noble
birth
your
gentleman
o
quality
here
he
turned
his
back
and
paced
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
room
when
he
faced
me
again
his
austere
look
was
gone
in
its
stead
was
the
grimly
whimsical
expression
of
the
mariner
as
i
had
seen
him
first
damme
says
i
scowling
was
it
to
read
me
homilies
that
you
had
me
here
aha
shipmate
says
he
with
rueful
smile
there
spake
the
young
divine
the
excellent
divinity
student
who
committed
a
peccadillo
long
years
agone
and
sailing
to
the
golden
west
gave
place
to
one
adam
penfeather
a
as
you
shall
hear
tell
of
at
kitt
tortuga
santa
catalina
and
a
score
o
places
along
the
main
as
to
yourself
shipmate
if
is
only
vengeance
ye
seek
vengeance
let
it
be
though
when
all
done
is
but
wind
hist
here
cometh
the
come
in
jo
lad
come
in
was
trusty
joel
bym
here
gave
me
my
first
lesson
in
navigation
eh
jo
aye
growled
the
hairy
giant
by
cock
them
was
the
days
a
fair
wind
a
quick
eye
an
no
favour
aye
them
was
the
days
by
so
saying
he
placed
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table
together
with
a
curious
silver
cup
and
at
a
sign
from
penfeather
left
us
together
and
now
comrade
says
penfeather
filling
the
goblet
draw
up
your
chair
and
do
as
i
do
and
now
as
we
sat
facing
each
other
across
the
table
penfeather
turns
back
his
left
sleeve
and
whipping
out
a
knife
nicked
himself
therewith
on
the
wrist
and
squeezed
thence
a
few
drops
of
blood
into
the
wine
which
done
he
passed
the
knife
to
me
and
i
though
misliking
the
extravagance
of
the
thing
nevertheless
did
the
same
martin
says
he
give
me
your
hand
so
now
swear
as
i
do
and
thus
clasping
each
other
hands
we
swore
the
oath
of
brotherhood
and
this
as
followeth
viz
to
keep
ever
each
other
counsel
to
aid
each
other
in
all
things
against
all
men
soever
to
cherish
and
comfort
each
other
in
every
adversity
to
be
faithful
each
to
each
unto
the
death
thereafter
at
his
command
i
drank
of
the
wine
wherein
our
blood
was
mingled
and
he
did
the
like
and
now
says
he
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
viewing
me
with
his
pensive
smile
since
we
be
brothers
and
comrades
sworn
how
d
like
me
now
better
than
i
did
says
i
speaking
on
impulse
for
sure
you
are
the
strangest
picaroon
that
ever
cheated
the
gallows
ah
says
he
pinching
his
chin
an
i
am
neither
hanged
nor
murdered
you
shall
one
day
find
me
a
worshipful
magistrate
martin
justice
the
peace
and
quorum
custos
rotulorum
and
the
rest
o
there
my
ambition
lies
as
for
you
martin
lord
wendover
there
is
your
enemy
ha
bloody
vengeance
and
murder
and
what
beside
that
is
mine
own
concern
i
retorted
angrily
and
look
since
comrades
we
are
you
will
forget
who
and
what
i
am
why
so
i
have
martin
so
i
have
art
a
poor
destitute
rogue
that
might
be
a
man
and
rich
but
for
this
vengeful
maggot
i
thy
brain
howbeit
my
comrade
sworn
and
and
as
such
i
shall
trust
thee
to
the
death
martin
and
shall
find
me
worthy
adam
despite
thy
curst
tongue
death
is
an
ill
thing
martin
is
it
says
i
and
laughed
aye
he
nodded
an
ill
thing
to
him
that
hath
ambitions
above
the
brute
see
here
unbuttoning
his
doublet
he
showed
me
a
shirt
of
fine
beneath
his
linen
turn
any
point
ever
forged
and
stop
a
bullet
handsomely
as
i
do
know
why
sure
says
i
a
little
scornful
you
avowed
yourself
a
cautious
man
true
martin
i
have
another
shirt
the
like
o
this
for
you
and
as
for
caution
i
have
need
d
see
comrade
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
is
an
ill
enough
thing
but
the
knife
that
stabbeth
i
the
dark
is
worse
this
shirt
hath
turned
death
thrice
already
once
i
the
breast
here
and
twice
the
shoulders
i
am
a
man
marked
for
death
martin
murder
creepeth
at
my
heels
it
hath
dogged
me
overseas
and
found
me
here
in
kent
at
last
it
seems
and
comrade
henceforth
the
steel
that
smiteth
me
shall
smite
you
also
belike
and
why
is
your
life
sought
thus
by
reason
of
a
secret
i
bear
about
me
wherefore
saving
only
my
good
friend
nicholas
frant
who
perished
i
have
ever
been
a
solitary
man
walking
alone
and
distrustful
of
my
fellows
for
martin
i
have
here
the
secret
of
a
treasure
that
hath
been
the
dream
and
hope
of
roving
adventurers
along
the
main
this
many
a
year
a
treasure
beyond
price
men
have
sought
it
vainly
have
striven
and
fought
suffered
and
died
for
it
have
endured
plague
battle
shipwreck
famine
have
died
screaming
indian
tortures
languished
in
spanish
dungeon
and
slaveship
and
all
for
sake
of
bartlemy
treasure
and
of
all
that
ever
sought
it
but
one
man
hath
ever
seen
this
treasure
and
i
am
that
man
martin
and
this
treasure
is
so
marvellous
well
hid
that
without
me
it
shall
lie
unfound
till
the
trump
of
doom
but
now
since
we
are
brethren
and
comrades
needs
must
i
share
with
thee
the
treasure
and
the
secret
of
it
no
no
adam
says
i
keep
it
to
yourself
i
none
of
it
share
and
share
says
he
is
the
law
of
the
coast
none
the
less
i
want
nought
of
it
is
the
law
he
repeated
and
moreover
with
such
vast
wealth
a
man
shall
buy
anything
in
this
world
even
vengeance
martin
now
here
the
secret
of
our
treasure
hereupon
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
and
drew
out
a
small
oilskin
packet
or
bag
suspended
about
his
lean
throat
by
a
thin
steel
chain
and
from
this
he
drew
forth
a
small
roll
of
parchment
here
is
martin
says
he
softly
here
that
so
many
lusty
men
have
perished
for
not
much
to
look
at
shipmate
torn
d
see
and
stained
but
here
wealth
martin
fame
honours
all
the
vices
and
all
the
evils
and
chief
among
vengeance
so
saying
he
unrolled
the
small
scrap
of
parchment
and
holding
it
before
me
i
saw
it
was
a
rough
chart
take
it
martin
and
study
it
the
while
i
tell
you
my
story
chapter
xi
adam
penfeather
his
narrative
mine
is
a
strange
wild
story
martin
but
needs
must
i
tell
it
and
in
few
words
as
may
be
fifteen
years
agone
or
thereabouts
i
became
one
of
that
league
known
as
the
brotherhood
of
the
coast
and
swore
comradeship
with
one
nicholas
frant
a
kent
man
even
as
i
now
though
i
was
full
young
and
a
cautious
man
yet
having
a
natural
hatred
of
spaniards
and
their
ways
i
wrought
right
well
against
them
and
was
mighty
diligent
in
many
desperate
affrays
against
their
ships
and
along
the
coast
was
i
and
my
good
comrade
nick
frant
with
sixteen
lusty
lads
took
sea
in
an
open
pinnace
and
captured
the
great
treasure
galleon
del
principe
off
carthagena
and
what
with
all
this
martin
and
my
being
blessed
with
some
education
and
a
gift
of
adding
two
and
two
together
i
got
me
rapid
advancement
in
the
brotherhood
until
well
shipmate
i
that
am
poor
and
solitary
was
once
rich
and
with
nigh
a
thousand
bully
fellows
at
command
and
then
it
was
that
i
fell
in
with
that
that
master
rogue
whose
deeds
had
long
been
a
terror
throughout
the
main
a
fellow
more
bloody
than
any
spaniard
more
treacherous
than
any
portugal
and
more
cruel
than
any
indian
inca
mosquito
maya
or
aztec
and
this
man
an
englishman
and
one
of
birth
and
breeding
who
hid
his
identity
under
the
name
of
bartlemy
i
met
him
first
in
tortuga
where
we
o
the
brotherhood
lay
six
stout
ships
and
nigh
four
hundred
men
convened
for
an
expedition
against
santa
catalina
and
this
for
two
reasons
first
because
was
a
notable
rich
city
and
second
to
rescue
certain
of
the
brotherhood
that
lay
there
waiting
to
be
burnt
at
the
next
well
martin
is
upon
a
certain
evening
that
this
bartlemy
comes
aboard
my
ship
and
with
him
his
mate
by
name
tressady
and
never
was
greater
difference
than
these
two
tressady
being
a
great
wild
fellow
with
a
steel
hook
in
place
of
his
left
hand
d
see
and
bartlemy
a
slender
gentleman
very
nice
as
to
speech
and
deportment
and
clad
in
the
latest
mode
from
curling
periwig
to
jewelled
penfeather
says
he
most
dutiful
humble
ha
let
me
parish
but
here
is
curst
reek
o
tar
with
which
martin
he
claps
a
jewelled
pomander
to
the
delicate
nose
of
him
heard
of
me
i
think
captain
says
he
of
my
ship
yonder
the
delight
i
told
him
i
had
martin
bluntly
and
to
the
point
whereat
he
laughs
and
bows
and
forthwith
proffers
to
aid
us
against
santa
catalina
the
which
i
refused
forthwith
but
my
council
of
captains
seeing
his
ship
was
larger
than
any
we
possessed
and
exceeding
well
armed
and
manned
overruled
me
and
the
end
of
it
was
we
sailed
six
ships
of
the
brotherhood
and
this
accursed
pirate
well
martin
santa
catalina
fell
according
to
my
plans
and
the
governor
and
council
agreeing
to
pay
ransom
i
drew
off
my
companies
and
camped
outside
the
walls
of
the
town
till
they
should
collect
the
money
now
the
women
of
this
place
were
exceeding
comely
martin
in
especial
the
governor
lady
and
upon
the
second
night
was
sudden
outcry
and
uproar
within
the
city
whereupon
i
marched
into
the
place
forthwith
and
found
this
curst
bartlemy
and
his
rogues
grown
impatient
were
at
their
devil
work
hastening
to
the
house
i
found
it
gutted
and
him
dragged
from
his
bed
and
with
the
life
gashed
out
of
him
aye
martin
torn
body
and
throat
d
see
as
by
the
fangs
of
some
great
beast
that
was
the
first
time
i
saw
what
a
steel
hook
may
do
as
for
this
poor
gentleman
lady
she
was
gone
hereupon
we
o
the
brotherhood
fell
upon
these
pirate
rogues
and
fought
them
by
light
o
the
blazing
houses
for
they
had
fired
the
city
and
i
thus
espying
the
devil
bartlemy
met
him
point
to
point
he
was
very
full
o
rapier
tricks
but
so
was
i
martin
also
i
was
younger
and
winged
him
sore
and
had
surely
ended
him
but
that
tressady
and
divers
others
got
him
away
and
what
with
the
dark
night
and
the
woods
that
lie
shorewards
he
together
with
some
few
of
his
crew
got
them
back
aboard
his
ship
the
ladies
delight
and
so
away
but
twelve
of
his
rogues
we
took
beyond
divers
we
slew
in
fight
and
those
twelve
i
saw
hanged
that
same
hour
a
week
later
we
sailed
for
tortuga
with
no
less
than
ninety
and
one
thousand
pieces
of
eight
for
our
labour
but
i
and
those
with
me
never
had
the
spending
of
a
single
piece
martin
for
we
ran
into
a
storm
such
as
i
never
saw
the
like
of
even
in
those
seas
well
we
ran
afore
it
for
three
days
and
its
fury
nothing
abating
all
this
time
i
never
quit
the
deck
but
i
had
been
wounded
and
on
the
third
night
being
fevered
and
outworn
turned
in
below
i
was
awakened
by
nick
frant
roaring
in
my
ear
for
the
tempest
was
very
loud
and
fierce
cried
he
lost
every
soul
and
the
good
money
struck
a
reef
adam
and
is
the
end
and
o
the
good
money
hereupon
i
climbed
deck
the
vessel
on
her
beam
ends
and
in
desperate
plight
and
nought
to
be
seen
i
the
dark
save
the
white
spume
as
the
seas
broke
over
us
none
the
less
i
set
the
crew
to
cutting
away
her
masts
and
heaving
the
ordnance
overboard
to
lighten
her
thereby
but
while
this
was
doing
comes
a
great
wave
roaring
out
of
the
dark
and
dashing
aboard
us
whirled
me
up
and
away
and
i
borne
aloft
on
that
mighty
hissing
sea
strove
no
more
doubting
not
my
course
was
run
so
blinded
choking
i
was
borne
aloft
and
then
martin
found
myself
adrift
in
water
calm
as
any
millpond
a
small
lagoon
and
spying
through
the
dark
a
grove
of
palmetto
trees
presently
managed
to
climb
ashore
more
dead
than
alive
and
lying
there
i
prayed
a
thing
i
had
not
done
for
many
a
year
as
the
dawn
came
i
saw
the
great
wave
had
hurled
me
over
the
barrier
reef
into
this
small
lagoon
and
beyond
the
reef
lay
all
that
remained
of
my
good
ship
i
was
yet
viewing
this
dolorous
sight
and
much
cast
down
for
the
loss
of
my
companions
in
especial
my
sworn
friend
nicholas
frant
when
i
heard
a
sound
behind
me
and
turning
about
espied
a
woman
and
in
this
woman
face
fair
though
it
was
i
read
horror
and
sadness
beyond
tears
and
yet
i
knew
her
for
the
same
had
been
wife
to
the
murdered
governor
of
santa
catalina
back
says
she
in
spanish
pointing
to
the
surf
that
thundered
beyond
the
reef
back
here
is
the
devil
the
sea
hath
more
mercy
go
back
whiles
ye
may
and
now
she
checked
all
at
once
and
falls
for
a
voice
reached
us
a
man
voice
fair
to
hear
and
the
song
he
sang
was
this
cheerly
o
and
cheerly
o
and
cheerly
come
sing
o
while
at
the
mainyard
to
and
fro
and
knowing
this
voice
to
my
cost
i
looked
around
for
some
weapon
since
i
had
none
and
was
all
but
naked
and
whipping
up
a
jagged
and
serviceable
stone
stood
awaiting
him
with
this
in
my
fist
and
down
the
beach
he
comes
jocund
and
debonair
in
his
finery
albeit
something
pale
by
reason
of
excess
and
my
rapier
work
and
now
i
come
to
look
at
you
martin
he
was
just
such
another
as
you
as
to
face
and
feature
though
lacking
your
beef
and
bone
now
he
beholding
me
where
i
stood
flourishes
off
his
belaced
hat
and
making
me
a
bow
comes
on
smiling
says
he
gaily
captain
penfeather
of
the
brotherhood
with
my
latest
wife
is
she
not
a
pearl
o
dainty
captain
a
sweet
and
luscious
piece
a
passionate
proud
beauty
worth
the
taming
ha
captain
and
she
is
tamed
see
you
to
your
dainty
knees
wench
down
now
though
he
smiled
yet
and
spake
her
gentle
she
bowing
proud
head
sank
to
her
knees
crouching
on
the
ground
before
him
while
he
looked
down
on
her
the
devil
in
his
eyes
and
his
jewelled
fingers
toying
with
the
dagger
in
his
girdle
a
strange
dagger
with
a
hilt
wrought
very
artificially
in
the
shape
of
a
naked
woman
how
says
i
leaning
across
the
table
a
woman
penfeather
aye
shipmate
so
i
stood
mighty
alert
my
eyes
on
this
dagger
being
minded
to
whip
it
into
his
rogue
heart
as
chance
might
offer
wonder
says
he
to
this
poor
lady
wonder
how
long
i
shall
keep
thee
madonna
a
week
a
month
a
year
venus
knoweth
for
you
amuse
me
sweet
rise
rise
dear
my
lady
my
dolores
of
joy
rise
and
aid
me
with
thy
counsel
for
here
hath
this
misfortunate
clumsy
captain
fool
blundered
into
our
amorous
paradise
this
tender
cyprian
isle
sacred
to
our
passion
yet
here
is
he
profaning
our
joys
with
his
base
material
presence
how
then
shall
we
rid
ourselves
of
this
offence
the
knife
this
lover
o
men
of
mine
the
bullet
yet
is
a
poor
small
naked
rogue
and
in
two
days
cometh
my
delight
and
tressady
with
his
hook
see
my
dolores
for
two
days
he
shall
be
our
slave
and
thereafter
for
thy
joy
shall
show
thee
how
to
die
my
sweet
torn
pimento
trees
or
tressady
hook
thou
shalt
choose
the
manner
and
now
unveil
unveil
my
goddess
of
the
isle
so
shall
ha
martin
my
stone
took
him
the
ear
and
as
he
swayed
reeling
to
the
blow
lithe
and
swift
as
any
panther
this
tortured
woman
sprang
and
i
saw
the
flash
of
steel
ere
it
was
buried
in
his
breast
even
then
he
did
fall
but
staggering
to
a
pimento
tree
leans
him
there
and
falls
a
strange
gasping
laugh
and
as
he
laughed
thus
i
saw
the
silver
haft
of
the
dagger
that
was
a
woman
leap
and
quiver
in
his
breast
then
laughing
yet
he
never
heeding
me
plucked
and
levelled
sudden
pistol
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
the
brave
spanish
lady
lay
dead
upon
the
sands
noble
piece
captain
says
he
gasping
for
breath
and
then
to
her
gone
my
goddess
i
follow
thee
and
now
he
sinks
to
his
knees
and
begins
to
crawl
where
she
lay
but
getting
no
further
than
her
feet
by
reason
of
his
faintness
he
clasps
her
feet
and
kisses
them
and
laying
his
head
upon
them
closes
his
eyes
he
groans
treasure
hidden
dagger
then
i
came
very
hastily
and
raised
his
head
for
i
had
oft
heard
talk
o
this
treasure
and
in
that
moment
he
died
so
i
left
them
lying
and
coming
to
the
seaboard
sat
there
a
great
while
watching
the
break
o
the
seas
on
what
was
left
o
the
wreck
yet
seeing
it
not
i
sat
there
till
noon
martin
until
driven
by
thirst
and
hunger
and
heat
of
sun
i
set
off
to
seek
their
habitation
for
by
their
looks
i
judged
them
and
housed
but
and
here
was
the
marvel
martin
seek
how
i
might
i
found
no
sign
of
any
hut
or
shelter
save
that
afforded
by
nature
as
caves
and
trees
and
was
forced
to
satisfy
my
cravings
with
such
fruits
as
flourished
in
profusion
for
this
island
martin
is
a
very
earthly
paradise
that
night
the
moon
being
high
and
bright
i
came
to
that
stretch
of
silver
sand
beside
the
lagoon
where
they
lay
together
rigid
and
pale
and
though
i
had
no
other
tool
but
his
dagger
and
a
piece
o
driftwood
made
shift
to
bury
them
the
great
pimento
tree
that
stood
beside
the
rock
and
both
in
the
same
grave
which
done
i
betook
me
to
a
dry
cave
hard
by
a
notable
fall
of
water
that
plungeth
into
a
lake
and
there
passed
the
night
next
day
having
explored
the
island
very
thoroughly
and
dined
as
best
i
might
on
that
do
abound
i
sat
me
down
where
i
might
behold
the
sea
and
fell
to
viewing
of
this
dagger
the
which
was
shaped
like
to
a
woman
says
i
aye
martin
and
now
bethinking
me
of
bartlemy
dying
words
anent
this
same
dagger
and
of
the
tales
i
had
heard
full
oft
along
the
main
regarding
this
same
bartlemy
and
his
hidden
treasure
i
fell
to
handling
this
dagger
turning
and
twisting
it
this
way
and
that
and
suddenly
shipmate
i
felt
the
head
turn
upon
the
shoulders
the
clasping
hands
turn
and
turn
until
it
came
away
and
showed
a
cavity
and
in
this
cavity
a
roll
of
parchment
and
that
parchment
none
other
than
this
map
with
the
cryptogram
the
which
i
could
make
nought
of
now
as
i
sat
thus
studying
this
meaningless
jumble
of
words
i
of
a
sudden
espied
a
man
below
me
on
the
reef
a
wild
figure
his
scanty
clothing
all
shreds
and
tatters
and
as
he
went
seeking
of
that
were
plenteous
enough
i
knew
him
for
my
sworn
comrade
nick
frant
and
then
martin
i
did
strange
thing
for
though
we
were
i
made
haste
and
all
of
a
tremble
to
slip
back
this
map
into
its
which
done
i
arose
hailing
my
comrade
and
went
to
meet
him
joyously
enough
and
no
two
men
in
the
world
more
rejoiced
than
we
as
we
clasped
hands
and
embraced
each
other
as
only
comrades
may
it
seemed
the
hugeous
sea
that
had
caught
me
had
caught
him
likewise
and
hurled
him
sore
bruised
some
mile
to
the
south
of
the
reef
so
now
i
told
him
of
the
deaths
of
bartlemy
and
the
poor
lady
yet
martin
and
this
was
strange
i
spoke
nothing
of
knife
or
treasure
i
told
him
of
the
expectation
i
had
of
the
pirate
ship
return
and
yet
i
never
once
spake
o
the
map
and
chart
and
methinks
the
secret
cast
a
shadow
betwixt
us
that
grew
ever
deeper
for
as
the
days
passed
and
no
sail
appeared
there
came
a
strangeness
an
unlove
betwixt
us
that
grew
until
one
day
we
fell
to
open
quarrel
disputation
and
deadly
strife
and
the
matter
no
more
than
a
dead
man
shirt
and
that
ragged
that
had
come
ashore
and
we
being
in
rags
and
the
sun
scorching
each
claimed
this
shirt
and
from
words
came
blows
he
had
his
seaman
knife
and
i
bartlemy
accursed
dagger
and
so
we
fought
after
the
manner
of
the
buccaneers
his
leg
bound
fast
to
mine
and
martin
though
he
was
a
great
fellow
and
strong
and
wounded
me
sore
in
the
end
i
got
in
a
thrust
under
the
armpit
and
he
fell
and
i
with
him
then
i
seeing
death
in
his
eyes
martin
clasped
him
in
my
arms
and
kissed
him
and
besought
him
not
to
die
whereat
he
smiled
says
he
adam
lad
and
so
died
then
i
took
that
accursed
dagger
wet
with
my
comrade
and
hurled
it
from
me
and
so
with
many
tears
and
lamentations
i
presently
buried
poor
nick
frant
in
the
sands
and
lay
there
face
down
upon
his
grave
wetting
it
with
my
tears
and
groaning
there
till
nightfall
but
all
next
day
martin
though
my
heart
yearned
to
my
slain
friend
all
next
day
i
spent
seeking
and
searching
for
the
dagger
had
killed
him
and
as
the
sun
set
i
found
it
thereafter
i
passed
my
days
since
the
pirate
ship
came
not
doubtless
owing
to
the
late
tempest
studying
the
writing
on
the
chart
here
yet
came
no
nearer
a
solution
though
my
imagination
was
inflamed
by
mention
of
diamonds
rubies
and
pearls
as
ye
may
see
written
here
for
yourself
so
the
time
passed
till
one
day
at
dawn
i
beheld
a
great
ship
her
mizzen
and
gone
standing
in
for
my
island
and
as
she
drew
nearer
i
knew
her
at
last
for
that
accursed
pirate
ship
called
delight
being
come
to
anchor
within
some
or
so
i
saw
a
boat
put
off
for
the
reef
and
lying
well
hid
i
watched
this
boat
steered
by
a
knowing
hand
pass
through
the
reef
by
a
narrow
channel
and
so
enter
the
lagoon
now
in
this
boat
were
six
men
and
at
the
rudder
sat
tressady
and
i
saw
his
hook
flash
in
the
sun
as
he
sprang
ashore
having
beached
their
boat
they
fell
to
letting
off
their
calivers
and
pistols
and
hallooing
captain
they
roared
ahoy
and
this
outcry
maintained
they
for
some
while
but
none
appearing
to
answer
they
seemed
to
take
counsel
together
and
thereafter
set
off
three
and
three
shouting
as
they
went
and
now
it
seemed
they
knew
no
more
of
bartlemy
than
i
whereat
i
rejoiced
greatly
so
lay
i
all
that
forenoon
watching
their
motions
and
hearing
their
outcries
now
here
now
there
until
marvelling
at
the
absence
of
bartlemy
they
sat
down
all
six
upon
the
spit
of
sand
whereby
i
lay
hid
and
fell
to
eating
and
drinking
talking
the
while
though
too
low
for
me
to
hear
what
passed
but
all
at
once
they
seemed
to
fall
to
disputation
tressady
and
a
small
dark
fellow
against
the
four
and
thereafter
to
brawl
and
fight
though
this
was
more
butchery
than
fight
martin
for
tressady
shoots
down
two
ere
they
can
rise
and
leaping
up
falls
on
the
other
two
with
his
hook
so
with
aid
from
the
small
dark
fellow
they
soon
have
made
an
end
o
their
four
companions
and
leaving
them
lying
come
up
the
beach
and
sitting
below
the
ledge
of
rock
whereon
i
lay
snug
hidden
fell
to
talk
ben
camarado
mio
we
be
committed
to
it
now
since
these
four
be
dead
and
all
men
by
bartlemy
needs
must
bartlemy
follow
says
the
man
ben
we
have
found
him
though
bartlemy
a
fighting
man
being
a
man
can
die
ben
and
he
once
dead
we
stand
his
heirs
you
and
i
ben
i
and
you
and
good
says
ben
for
this
treasure
where
lieth
it
and
for
that
matter
roger
where
is
bartlemy
to
find
ben
so
let
us
set
about
it
forthwith
the
which
they
did
martin
for
three
days
they
sought
the
island
over
and
i
watching
on
the
third
day
as
they
are
sitting
the
great
pimento
tree
i
have
mentioned
and
i
watching
close
by
tressady
sits
up
all
at
once
says
he
be
yon
and
he
pointed
to
a
mound
of
sand
hard
by
knoweth
says
ben
been
digging
says
tressady
none
so
long
since
said
ben
now
what
says
tressady
us
dig
likewise
but
what
with
says
ben
fingers
says
tressady
so
there
and
then
they
fell
to
digging
casting
up
the
loose
sand
with
their
two
hands
and
i
watching
turned
my
head
that
i
might
not
see
says
tressady
in
a
while
is
foul
reek
ben
foul
reek
curst
says
ben
and
then
uttered
a
great
hoarse
cry
and
i
knowing
what
they
had
come
upon
kept
my
face
turned
away
she
says
ben
in
a
whisper
and
him
says
tressady
man
is
ill
thing
but
needs
must
his
dagger
ben
his
dagger
no
dagger
says
ben
empty
sheath
but
no
steel
i
fallen
out
says
tressady
in
a
strangled
voice
ben
seek
so
despite
the
horror
of
the
thing
they
sought
martin
violating
death
and
careless
of
corruption
they
sought
and
all
the
time
the
thing
they
sought
was
quivering
in
this
right
hand
says
tressady
when
they
were
done
how
came
he
dead
how
shall
say
roger
mayhap
they
did
each
other
business
then
where
the
dagger
o
the
woman
the
silver
goddess
where
and
how
came
they
buried
there
the
rub
roger
says
tressady
ben
is
in
my
mind
we
not
alone
on
this
island
who
should
be
here
roger
man
that
slew
our
captain
here
there
was
silence
awhile
then
the
man
ben
arose
and
spat
says
he
away
roger
ere
i
stifle
come
i
the
devil
name
so
they
went
and
i
lying
hid
secure
watched
them
out
of
sight
now
when
they
were
gone
i
took
counsel
with
myself
for
here
were
two
desperate
bloody
rogues
very
well
armed
and
here
was
i
a
solitary
man
with
nought
to
my
defence
save
for
nick
knife
and
the
dagger
which
was
heavy
odds
martin
as
you
agree
now
i
have
ever
accounted
myself
a
something
timid
man
wherefore
in
cases
of
desperate
need
and
danger
i
have
been
wont
to
rely
on
my
wit
rather
than
weapons
on
head
rather
than
hands
so
now
as
i
looked
upon
this
cursed
dagger
wherewith
i
had
slain
my
poor
friend
beholding
this
evil
silver
woman
whose
smile
seemed
verily
to
allure
men
to
strife
and
bloodshed
the
end
of
it
was
i
stole
from
my
and
set
the
dagger
amid
the
gnarled
roots
of
the
great
pimento
tree
where
it
might
have
slipped
from
dying
fingers
and
so
got
me
back
into
hiding
and
sure
enough
in
a
while
comes
the
big
man
tressady
and
falls
to
hunting
both
in
the
open
grave
and
round
about
it
but
finding
nothing
steals
him
off
again
scarce
was
he
out
of
martin
than
cometh
the
little
dark
fellow
ben
who
likewise
fell
to
stealthy
search
grubbing
here
and
there
on
hands
and
knees
yet
with
none
better
fortune
than
his
comrade
but
of
a
sudden
he
gives
a
spring
and
stooping
stands
erect
with
dagger
in
his
hand
now
scarce
had
he
found
it
than
comes
tressady
creeping
from
where
he
had
lain
watching
ben
says
he
jovially
then
lad
how
then
hast
found
what
we
sought

he
gripping

in
quivering
fist
and
glancing
up
sideways
and
blade
ben
the
chart
roger
and
the
chart
ben
says
tressady
coming
a
pace
nearer
and
i
saw
his
hook
glitter

treasure

says
ben
making
little
passes
in
the
air

blue

and
whips
a
pistol
from
his
belt
roger
says
he
found
the
dagger
without
ye
and
i
find
the
chart
stand
back
here
ill

to

ben
ill

sink
me
but
as
ye
will
only
out
wi

and
let

the
treasure
ben
d
know
the
secret
o
this
thing
roger
i
ben
then
must
i
break
it
asunder
hand
me
yon
piece
o
of
rock
says
ben
pointing
to
a
heavy
stone
that
chanced
to
be
near
ben
lad
pity
to
crush
the
silver
woman
but
if
you
will
you
will
ben
take
a
hold
so
saying
tressady
picked
up
the
stone
but
as
his
comrade
reached
to
take
it
let
it
fall
whereupon
ben
stooped
for
it
and
in
that
moment
tressady
was
on
him
and
then
ha
martin
i
heard
the
man
ben
scream
and
as
he
writhed
saw
tressady
hook
at
work
the
man
screamed
but
once
and
then
wiping
the
hook
on
his
dead
comrade
coat
he
took
up
the
dagger
and
began
to
unscrew
the
head
but
now
martin
methought
was
time
for
me
to
act
if
i
meant
to
save
my
life
for
i
had
nought
but
nick
knife
while
within
tressady
reach
lay
the
dead
man
pistols
and
divers
musquetoons
and
fusees
on
the
beach
behind
him
which
put
me
to
no
small
panic
lest
he
shoot
me
ere
i
could
come
at
him
with
my
knife
thus
as
i
lay
watching
i
took
counsel
with
myself
how
i
might
lure
him
away
from
these
firearms
wherewith
he
might
hunt
me
down
and
destroy
me
at
his
ease
and
the
end
of
it
was
i
started
up
all
at
once
and
leaning
down
towards
him
shook
the
parchment
in
his
face
tressady
says
i
this
the
thing
you
murdered
your
comrade
for
now
at
this
tressady
sprang
back
to
stare
from
me
to
the
thing
in
my
hand
martin
and
then
ha
then
with
a
roar
he
sprang
straight
at
me
with
his
hook
even
as
i
had
judged
he
would
as
for
me
i
turned
and
ran
making
for
a
rocky
ledge
i
knew
with
tressady
panting
behind
me
his
hook
ringing
on
the
rocks
as
he
scrambled
in
pursuit
so
at
last
we
reached
the
place
i
sought
a
shelf
of
rock
the
cliff
on
one
side
martin
and
on
the
other
a
void
with
the
sea
thundering
far
below
a
narrow
ledge
where
his
great
bulk
hampered
him
and
his
strength
availed
little
and
there
we
fought
his
dagger
and
hook
against
my
dead
comrade
knife
and
thus
as
he
sprang
i
falling
on
my
knee
smote
up
beneath
raised
arm
heard
him
roar
and
saw
him
go
whirling
over
and
down
and
splash
into
the
sea
and
he
had
the
dagger
with
him
adam
says
i
in
eager
question
aye
martin
which
was
the
end
of
an
ill
rogue
and
an
evil
thing
the
end
says
i
the
end
adam
why
then
what
o
this
so
saying
i
whipped
the
strange
dagger
from
my
wallet
and
held
it
towards
him
balanced
upon
my
palm
now
beholding
this
eyes
opened
suddenly
wide
then
narrowed
to
slits
as
viewing
this
deadly
thing
he
drew
back
and
back
and
so
sat
huddled
in
his
chair
utterly
still
only
i
heard
his
breath
hiss
softly
clenched
teeth
martin
says
he
in
the
same
hushed
voice
when
a
man
dead
dead
and
the
dead
can
never
come
back
can
they
shipmate
but
now
as
we
sat
thus
eyeing
the
evil
thing
on
the
table
betwixt
us
my
answer
died
on
my
lips
for
there
came
a
sharp
quick
rapping
of
fingers
on
the
lattice
chapter
xii
telleth
of
a
fight
in
the
dark
penfeather
was
at
the
casement
had
whipped
open
the
lattice
and
pinning
the
intruder
by
the
throat
thrust
a
pistol
into
his
face
all
in
a
moment
and
then
i
recognised
godby
the
peddler
let
be
adam
i
cried
springing
forward
let
be
here
a
friend
saying
nothing
penfeather
thrust
away
the
weapon
and
gripping
the
little
man
in
both
hands
with
prodigious
strength
jerked
him
bodily
in
through
the
window
which
done
he
clapped
to
the
lattice
and
drawing
the
curtain
stood
fronting
godby
and
now
what
says
he
softly

gasped

adam
pinching

chin
did

a
loose
cloak
about

then
master
adam
you
shall
offer
to
him
such
employ
in
my
ship
the
friend
as
he
will
accept
and
this
is
my
wish
and
command
joan
brandon
he
is
great
and
tall
and
fierce
with
yellow
hair
and
cruell
mouth
yet
seemeth
more
cruell
than
he
trulie
is
so
there
you
are
to
a
hair
martin
and
here
our
enterprise
brought
to
nought
if
she
sail
on
this
venture
why
then
she
must
sail
says
i
is
her
ship
martin
and
she
a
brandon
then
sail
without
her
and
be
taken
before
we
clear
o
the
downs
and
strung
up
at
execution
dock
for
piracy
why
then
if
she
goeth
aboard
i
do
and
wherefore
not
martin
i
take
no
service
with
a
brandon
aye
verily
there
your
pride
martin
which
is
cumbersome
cargo
call
it
what
you
will
i
not
sail
and
your
oath
comrade
sail
along
o
me
you
must
and
shall
but
having
respect
for
your
pride
you
shall
stow
away
in
some
hole
or
corner
and
she
never
know
you
aboard
hereupon
i
scowled
but
perceiving
him
so
serene
albeit
a
little
grim
i
said
no
more
and
he
fell
to
pacing
slowly
back
and
forth
head
bowed
and
hands
locked
behind
him
i
need
you
martin
says
he
at
last
aye
i
need
you
even
more
than
i
thought
the
one
man
i
may
trust
to
in
a
pinch
for
martin
that
i
do
understand
so
saying
he
halted
by
the
table
and
presently
taking
up
the
dagger
and
with
a
strange
reluctance
fell
to
twisting
it
this
way
and
that
finally
he
gave
a
sudden
twist
and
the
smiling
head
of
the
silver
woman
coming
away
showed
a
hollow
cavity
running
the
length
of
the
haft
roomy
and
cunningly
contrived
slowly
he
fitted
the
head
into
place
again
and
laying
the
weapon
down
shook
his
head
here
bartlemy
dagger
true
enough
martin
says
he
touching
its
keen
point
here
what
found
bartlemy
black
heart
aye
and
many
another
here
what
went
hurtling
over
cliff
in
tressady
fist
and
yet
here
it
lies
which
is
great
matter
for
wonder
martin
and
since
here
why
then
where
is
the
vile
rogue
tressady
which
is
matter
for
painful
speculation
martin
where
snoring
likely
enough
says
i
not
so
far
hence
or
tramping
hither
if
so
martin
then
death
can
not
touch
him
the
which
is
out
of
all
reason
is
more
like
the
fall
did
not
kill
him
adam
had
you
but
seen
the
place
shipmate
but
if
water
wo
drown
him
and
steel
wo
harm
him
like
you
he
wears
a
adam
that
i
do
know
moreover
the
devil
cherisheth
his
own
i
heard
why
here
reason
martin
plain
reason
i
grant
and
yet
but
is
late
and
you
be
for
sleep
and
there
reason
in
that
too
come
i
show
your
bed
spare
yourself
i
want
no
bed
says
i
bitterly
a
luxury
wasted
on
the
likes
o
me
my
couch
shall
be
the
corner
yonder
ah
prideful
youth
is
sweet
to
be
young
martin
says
penfeather
with
his
sudden
whimsical
and
clapping
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
sleep
where
ye
will
that
corner
is
as
good
as
another
see
there
stands
my
tuck
a
spanish
blade
of
notable
good
temper
it
hath
been
a
true
friend
to
me
many
a
time
ere
now
and
should
be
a
trusty
bedfellow
as
for
me
i
for
a
and
martin
says
he
pausing
to
pinch
his
chin
and
view
me
sideways
if
aught
should
chance
to
me
at
any
time
the
chart
and
treasure
will
be
yours
so
comrade
and
sleep
sound
for
is
like
we
shall
wake
betimes
saying
which
he
turned
slow
and
thoughtful
and
went
out
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
as
for
me
being
very
drowsy
i
wrapped
myself
in
my
cloak
blew
out
the
candles
and
lying
down
in
the
corner
was
presently
fast
asleep
now
as
i
slept
i
dreamed
that
penfeather
long
rapier
standing
in
the
dark
corner
close
by
was
stealthily
endeavouring
to
free
itself
from
its
leathern
scabbard
with
intent
to
skewer
me
to
the
floor
as
i
lay
and
striving
thus
to
draw
itself
made
soft
strange
noises
and
rustlings
insomuch
that
i
presently
woke
and
staring
motionless
into
the
darkness
above
knew
that
these
sounds
were
real
somewhere
close
by
was
a
furtive
whisper
of
sound
that
came
and
went
a
breath
a
scraping
of
fingers
on
the
panelling
above
me
in
the
darkness
and
in
that
moment
also
i
became
aware
that
the
lattice
yawned
wide
upon
a
square
of
glimmering
blackness
suddenly
a
foot
touched
me
unseen
and
then
even
as
the
owner
of
this
foot
tripped
over
me
came
the
roaring
flash
of
a
pistol
hard
by
followed
immediately
by
another
and
as
i
lay
deafened
and
the
floor
quivered
to
the
soft
vicious
thud
of
leaping
feet
and
on
the
air
was
a
confused
scuffling
mingled
with
an
awful
worrying
sound
and
now
though
i
was
and
tingling
for
action
i
constrained
myself
to
lie
still
nothing
stirring
for
here
as
i
judged
was
desperate
indeed
more
than
once
i
heard
the
faint
click
of
steel
and
now
rose
shouts
and
cries
and
a
tramp
of
feet
on
the
stair
without
someone
reeled
staggering
across
the
room
came
at
the
open
casement
and
as
i
leapt
up
the
door
burst
open
and
joel
bym
appeared
flourishing
a
naked
hanger
and
with
godby
behind
bearing
a
lanthorn
whose
flickering
light
showed
adam
knife
in
hand
where
he
leaned
panting
against
the
wall
a
smear
of
blood
across
his
pallid
face
and
with
shirt
and
doublet
torn
in
horrid
fashion
the
window
he
gasped
shutters
bullets
i
sprang
forward
but
joel
was
before
me
and
crouching
beneath
the
open
lattice
swung
the
heavy
shutters
into
position
but
even
as
he
did
so
a
bullet
crashed
through
the
stout
oak
doors
all
fast
joel
aye
but
who
here
the
preventive
and
me
wi
the
cellars
my
cock
the
customs
worse
joel
says
penfeather
wiping
sweat
from
him
art
hurt
adam
i
questioned
eyeing
his
wild
figure
and
now
i
saw
that
the
thin
steel
chain
was
gone
from
his
sinewy
throat
no
shipmate
but
the
dagger
look
ye
is
clean
disappeared
martin
and
good
riddance
quoth
i
but
adam

your
chart

the
dagger

says
he
sheathing
his
knife

snug
in
that
wallet

my
wallet
i
cried
clapping
hand
on
it
where
it
hung
at
my
girdle
aye
shipmate
i
slipped
it
there
as
i
bid

but
martin
o

how
i
all

his
hook

hairy
head
forward

ye
say

hook

joel
tressady
alive

god
love

gasped
the
giant
and
sank
into
a
chair
chapter
xiii
we
set
out
for
deptford
pool
penfeather
drew
clenched
hand
across
his
brow
and
coming
to
the
table
reached
the
flagon
and
drank
what
remained
of
the
wine
thirstily
while
bym
his
great
body
huddled
in
the
chair
stared
at
the
bullet
hole
in
the
shutter
with
starting
eyes
as
to
me
i
picked
up
penfeather
fallen
pistols
and
laid
them
on
the
table
where
godby
had
set
the
lanthorn
tressady
says
bym
at
last
in
a
hoarse
whisper
tressady
o
be
ye
sarten
sure
sure
says
penfeather
in
the
same
hushed
manner
and
reaching
powder
and
bullets
from
a
cupboard
he
began
methodically
to
reload
his
pistols
he
be
outside
now
where
the
shadows
be
thickest
waiting
me
with
abnegation
and
sol
and
rory
and
god
knoweth
how
many
more
then
he
are
dead
penfeather
black
brows
flickered
and
his
keen
eyes
glanced
from
his
rent
doublet
round
about
the
room
howbeit
he
was
here
joel
said
he
why
then
the
dying
woman
curse
holds
and
he
ca
die
says
bym
clawing
at
his
great
beard
he
was
here
joel
in
this
room
says
penfeather
busy
with
man
to
man
knife
to
knife
and
i
missed
him
since
midnight
i
waited
wi
pistols
cocked
and
never
closed
eye
and
yet
here
was
he
or
ever
i
was
aware
for
as
i
sat
there
i
the
dark
by
the
window
above
the
porch
which
is
therefore
easiest
to
come
at
i
spied
mings
and
him
staring
up
at
the
lattice
of
this
chamber
so
here
creeps
i
and
opening
the
door
saw
him
move
against
the
open
lattice
yonder
a
shot
no
man
could
miss
aye
aye
and
i
missed
him
joel
with
both
weapons
and
i
within
three
yards
of
him
aye
i
missed
him
with
both
pistols
which
is
small
wonder
says
i
for
as
you
fired
he
tripped
over
me
adam
and
why
should
he
trip
just
then
at
the
one
and
only
moment
martin
chance
says
you
why
when
he
came
leaping
on
me
in
the
black
dark
should
his
hook
meet
and
turn
my
knife
from
his
throat
chance
again
says
you
why
when
he
flung
me
off
and
made
for
the
window
why
must
i
catch
my
foot
that
staff
o
yours
and
bring
up
against
the
wall
with
all
the
strength
and
breath
knocked
out
o
me
and
no
chance
for
one
thrust
as
he
clambered
through
the
lattice
by
the
lord
martin
here
more
than
chance
says
i
aye
by
cock
muttered
joel
shaking
his
head
is
he
be
you
mind
what
i
told
ye
the
poor
lady
as
died
raving
mad
aboard
the
how
she
died
cursing
him
wi
life
and
him
standing
by
o
that
hook
o
his
ah
i
never
forget
the
work
o
that
same
hook
many
the
time
prisoners
men
and
women
aboard
that
cursed
delight
by
cock
i
dream
o
sometimes
and
wake
all
of
a
sweat
here
no
time
for
dreams
says
penfeather
ramming
home
the
charge
of
his
second
pistol
is
the
passage
clear
save
for
the
matter
of
a
few
kegs
but
serve
we
start
in
half
an
hour
joel
the
three
o
you
aye
we
must
be
aboard
as
soon
as
maybe
now
captain
says
godby
speaking
as
a
a
mariner
and
a
peddler
i
bold
to
say
as
there
nought
like
bite
and
sup
to
hasten
a
man
for
a
journey
or
aught
beside
flog
me
else
and
there
nought
more
heartening
than
ham
or
neat
tongue
or
brisket
o
beef
the
which
i
chanced
to
spy
i
the
kitchen
why
then
says
penfeather
go
you
and
engage
those
same
in
close
action
and
i
join
ye
as
soon
as
i
shifted
these
rags
o
mine
adam
says
i
unstrapping
my
wallet
as
bym
and
godby
descended
the
stair
if
we
are
to
have
our
throats
cut
as
well
i
handed
back
your
chart
first
and
i
laid
it
on
the
table
why
is
as
safe
with
you
comrade
but
as
you
will
says
he
slipping
the
chain
about
his
neck
as
for
any
martin
you
find
that
with
danger
my
inborn
caution
groweth
to
timidity
ha
yes
i
nodded
such
timidity
as
walks
under
the
very
noses
of
desperate
rogues
of
a
moonlight
night
why
the
moon
is
down
or
nearly
so
martin
and
then
besides
this
trim
little
inn
hath
divers
exits
discreetly
was
a
monastery
once
i
heard
and
now
a
it
seems
adam
even
so
comrade
and
no
place
better
suited
and
there
the
hailing
says
he
as
a
hoarse
roar
of
supper
o
reached
us
go
down
martin
i
stay
but
to
make
things
and
he
nodded
towards
the
books
and
papers
that
littered
the
table
upon
the
stairs
i
met
godby
who
brought
me
to
a
kitchen
very
spacious
and
lofty
paved
with
great
flagstones
and
with
groined
arches
supporting
the
roof
and
what
with
this
and
the
wide
fireplace
flanked
with
fluted
columns
and
enriched
by
carvings
i
did
not
doubt
that
here
had
once
stood
a
noble
abbey
or
the
like
pal
said
godby
as
i
stared
about
me
you
never
guess
as
there
be
nigh
three
hundred
kegs
stowed
hereabouts
besides
bales
and
the
like
choke
me
else
ha
many
the
good
cargo
i
helped
jo
and
the
lads
to
run
eh
joel
so
you
a
smuggler
godby
says
i
cock
says
bym
reproachfully
and
setting
a
goodly
cheese
on
the
table
with
a
bang
say
cock
a
cackling
word
and
i
do
like
cackle
aye
nodded
godby
that
the
word
so
i
am
and
what
then
was
summat
o
the
sort
as
got
me
suspicioned
by
gregory
and
his
catchpolls
rot
but
here
adam
entered
very
soberly
dressed
in
clothes
and
we
sat
down
to
sup
forthwith
do
we
sail
soon
captain
questioned
godby
in
a
while
i
hope
to
be
clear
o
the
downs
a
few
days
hence
says
adam
and
you
so
quoth
bym
sir
rupert

thirty
new
men
i
hear
and
rogues
every
one
i
be
sworn
sir
rupert
says
i
my
lady
cousin
martin
and
captain
of
the
expedition
is
he
a
sailor
adam
no
martin
like
most
o
your
fine

no
more
of
navigation
than
this
cheese
which
is
just
as
well
martin
aye
mighty
well
how
so
who
shall
say
martin
who
shall
say
and
here
he
took
a
long
draught
of
ale
in
a
while
our
meal
being
ended
penfeather
rose
as
to
arms
martin
ha
ye
aught
beside
your
knife
my
staff
and
this
pistol
says
i
taking
out
the
weapon
my
lady
brandon
had
thrust
upon
me
loaded
martin
i
examined
charge
and
priming
and
nodded
good
says
adam
here
five
shot
betwixt
us
that
should
suffice
up
wi
the
trap
jo
and
we
out
hereupon
bym
lighted
his
lanthorn
and
putting
aside
the
great
settle
by
the
hearth
stooped
and
raised
one
of
the
flagstones
discovering
a
flight
of
worn
stone
steps
down
which
we
followed
him
and
so
into
a
great
cellar
or
vaulted
crypt
where
stood
row
upon
row
of
barrels
and
casks
piled
very
orderly
to
the
stone
roof
along
the
narrow
way
between
strode
bym
and
halting
suddenly
stooped
and
lifted
another
flagstone
with
more
steps
below
down
which
we
followed
him
into
a
fairly
paved
whence
divers
other
passages
opened
right
and
left
and
when
we
had
gone
some
distance
adam
halted
best
bring
the
light
no
further

says
he
and
joel
as
to
this
black
rogue
this
who
i
mean
jo
aye
him
that
same
jo
well
keep
an
eye
lifting
and
if

the
telling

o
your
lads

post
to
deptford

he
grasping

hook
joel
says
penfeather
softly
whereat
joel
clawed
at
his
beard
and
blinked
into
the
lanthorn
finally
he
gives
a
great
tug
to
his
beard
and
nods
aye
says
he
for
you
even
that
by
cock
good
lad

penfeather
clapping
him
on
brawny
shoulder
bide

jo
and
fortune
with
you
and
yours
this
way
martin
so
having
taken
our
leave
of
bym
godby
and
i
followed
adam
along
the
passage
guided
by
the
lanthorn
until
turning
a
sudden
sharp
corner
we
plunged
into
pitchy
gloom
wherein
i
groped
my
way
until
penfeather
voice
stayed
me
easy
all
says
he
softly
have
your
pistols
ready
and
heed
how
you
come
creeping
cautiously
i
found
myself
amid
leaves
that
yielded
before
me
and
stepping
through
this
natural
screen
i
stumbled
into
a
bush
and
presently
found
myself
standing
in
a
small
copse
by
a
waning
moon
and
never
a
sound
to
be
heard
save
the
soft
whisper
of
leaves
about
us
and
the
faint
far
cry
of
some
ha
says
adam
at
last
gazing
away
to
the
sinking
moon
so
our
journey
begins
and
from

look
o
things
martin
from
the
look

here
going
to
be
need
of
all
your
resolution
and
all
my
caution
ere
we
can
see
the
end
come
chapter
xiv
how
i
came
aboard
the
faithful
friend
we
followed
a
roundabout
course
now
across
broad
meadows
now
treading
green
now
climbing
some
grassy
upland
anon
plunging
into
the
shadow
of
lonely
wood
or
coppice
until
the
moon
was
down
until
was
a
glimmer
of
dawn
with
mists
brimming
every
grassy
hollow
and
creeping
in
leafy
boskages
until
in
the
east
was
a
glory
warming
the
grey
mist
to
pink
and
amber
and
gold
and
the
sun
uprising
darted
his
level
beams
athwart
our
way
and
it
was
day
and
now
from
coppice
and
hedgerow
near
and
far
was
stir
and
flutter
a
whistling
and
a
piping
that
rose
ever
louder
and
swelled
to
a
trilling
ecstasy
of
gladness
hark
to
o
pal
hark
to
quoth
godby
lifting
head
to
watch
a
lark
that
soared
aloft
here
music
martin
here
cure
for
the
megrims
hope
for
the
downcast
and
promise
o
joys
to
come
o
hark
to
all
the
day
penfeather
led
us
on
by
lonely
ways
never
seeming
to
weary
and
never
at
a
loss
silent
for
the
most
part
as
one
in
profound
thought
and
i
speaking
little
as
is
my
wont
but
godby
talked
and
sang
and
laughed
for
the
three
of
us
it
was
as
we
sat
outside
a
little
snugged
trees
eating
of
bread
and
cheese
that
penfeather
turned
suddenly
and
gripped
my
arm
martin
says
he
be
plaguy
business
carrying
women
aboard
ship
along
o
these
lambs
o
mine
there
scarce
a
rogue
but
cheats
the
gallows
with
his
every
breath
why
then
tell
her
so
adam
plain
and
to
the
point
be
vain
breath
martin
i
know
her
too
well
and
she
is
a
brandon
a
curse
on
the
name
says
i
whereupon
godby
choked
into
his
ale
stared
in
surprise
and
would
fain
have
questioned
me
but
meeting
my
eye
spake
no
word
d
know
aught
of
navigation
martin
says
adam
suddenly
no
whit
adam
but
i
handle
a
boat
with
any
man
ha
says
he
and
sat
there
pinching
his
chin
until
our
hunger
being
appeased
and
the
ale
all
drank
we
fared
on
again
so
we
tramped
and
though
our
road
was
long
i
will
here
make
short
work
of
it
and
say
that
at
last
we
came
very
hot
and
dusty
into
the
village
of
lewisham
where
we
would
fain
have
baited
awhile
at
the
and
lamb
a
fair
inn
but
this
adam
would
by
no
means
permit
so
leaving
the
village
we
presently
turned
aside
from
the
main
road
into
a
lane
very
pleasantly
shaded
by
tall
trees
and
bloomy
hedgerows
the
which
as
i
do
think
is
called
mill
lane
in
a
while
we
reached
a
narrow
track
down
which
adam
turned
and
now
as
we
went
i
was
aware
of
strange
sounds
a
confused
hubbub
growing
ever
louder
until
deep
amid
the
green
we
espied
a
lonely
tavern
before
which
stood
a
short
stout
man
who
alternately
wrung
his
hands
in
lamentation
mopped
at
bloody
pate
and
stamped
and
swore
mighty
vehement
in
the
midst
of
which
chancing
to
behold
penfeather
he
uttered
joyful
shout
and
came
running
master
penfeather
cried
he
o
master
penfeather
here
fine
doings
love
my
eyes
here
your
rogues
and
of
each
other
which
is
no
great
matter
but
here
them
o
my
house
which
is
great
matter
here
them
has
broke
my
head
wi
one
my
own
pottlepots
which
is
greater
matter
here
me
durse
set
of
it
i
the
place
and
my
wife
and
maids
all
of
a
swound
o
master
penfeather
here
doings
love
my
limbs
ha
says
penfeather
fighting
are
they
jerry
like
devils
captain
your
rogues
and
the
rogues
as
my
lord
dering
and
brought
here
yesterday
o
love
my
liver
look
at
yon
as
he
spoke
was
a
crash
of
splintered
glass
and
a
broken
chair
hurtled
through
the
wide
lattice
so
says
adam
striding
towards
the
inn
and
i
saw
a
pistol
in
his
hand
following
hard
on
his
heels
i
entered
the
inn
with
him
and
so
to
the
scene
of
the
riot
a
long
low
room
full
of
swirling
dust
and
amid
this
choking
cloud
a
huddle
of
men
who
fought
and
struggled
fiercely
roaring
blasphemy
and
curses
two
or
three
lay
twisted
among
overturned
chairs
and
tables
others
had
crawled
into
corners
to
look
to
their
hurts
while
to
and
fro
the
battle
raged
the
fiercer
leaning
in
the
doorway
penfeather
surveyed
the
combatants
with
his
quick
keen
glance
and
then
the
hubbub
was
drowned
by
the
roar
of
his
long
pistol
the
thunderous
report
seemed
to
stun
the
combatants
to
silence
who
falling
apart
turned
one
and
all
to
glare
at
the
intruder
and
in
this
moment
of
comparative
silence
while
all
men
panted
and
stared
from
grim
lips
there
burst
a
string
of
blistering
such
as
even
i
had
scarce
heard
till
now
for
a
long
minute
he
reviled
them
the
smoke
curling
from
his
pistol
his
black
brows
knit
across
glittering
eyes
his
thin
nostrils
the
scar
glowing
on
his
pallid
cheek
his
face
indeed
so
changed
and
evil
that
i
scarce
knew
him
ye
filthy
scum
ye
lousy
sons
o
dogs
he
ended
ha
will
ye
fight
agin
my
orders
then
mutiny
is
it
and
who
a
plague
are
you
and
be
cursed
to
ye
panted
a
great
fellow
flourishing
a
broken
threateningly
and
scowling
in
murderous
fashion
he
tell
ye
there
behind
ye
fool
snarled
penfeather
pointing
sinewy
finger
the
big
man
turned
penfeather
sprang
with
uplifted
pistol
and
smote
him
stunned
and
bleeding
to
the
floor
then
bestriding
the
prostrate
carcass
fronted
the
rest
with
head
viciously
and
who
next
come
says
he
softly
scowling
from
one
to
other
of
the
shrinking
company
you
amos
penarth
and
you
richard
farnaby
aye
and
half
a
dozen
others
o

wi
me
ere
now
and
you

say
a
thing
i
mean

and

my
last
words
to
you

it

no
quarrelling
or

new
rogues

another
and
that

learn
to
be

penfeather
stand
forward
the
new
men
show
a
leg
and
bustle
ye
dogs
scowling
and
muttering
some
twelve
unlovely
fellows
obeyed
i
faith
says
penfeather
looking
them
over
here
fine
stuff
for
the
gallows
and
where
the
rest
of
gone
aboard
this
morning
along
o
toby
hudd

bright
lads
quoth
penfeather
eyeing
each
scowling
face
in
turn

when
you
come
aboard
my
ship
and
i
say
to
one
ye
do
this
or
do
that

or
up
to
the
he
swings
by
his
thumbs
or
his
neck
as
occasion
warrants
d
get
me
my
bully
roarers
not
a
man
of
them
spake
a
word
but
all
stood
shifting
uneasily
beneath
penfeather
quick
bright
eye
shuffling
their
feet
and
casting
furtive
glances
on
their
fellows
now
as
to
this
lump
o
roguery
says
penfeather
spurning
the
still
unconscious
man
with
his
foot
have
him
into
the
yard
and
heave
a
bucket
o
water
over
him
as
to
you
farnaby
muster
the
hands
and
stand
by
to
go
aboard
in
half
an
hour
every
unhung
rascal
without
we
came
on
the
misfortunate
landlord
still
in
the
deeps
of
gloom
but
upon
adam
assurance
that
all
damages
should
be
made
good
he
brought
us
up
a
pair
of
stairs
to
a
fair
chamber
and
there
served
us
a
most
excellent
meal
scarce
had
we
risen
from
table
than
comes
the
man
penarth
cap
in
hand
to
say
the
men
stood
ready
to
go
aboard
we
found
some
score
fellows
drawn
up
before
the
inn
and
a
desperate
lot
of
they
looked
what
with
their
hurts
and
general
air
as
they
stood
there
in
the
light
of
a
rising
moon
having
looked
them
over
each
and
every
penfeather
spat
and
setting
them
in
charge
ordered
them
to
go
on
before
well
martin
says
he
as
we
followed
together
and
how
think
ye
of
my
lambs
call
them
raging
tigers
rather
nay
says
he
tigers
be
cleanly
creatures
i
heard
god
name
adam
why
truck
with
such
ill
rogues
sure
there
be
many
honest
mariners
to
be
had
why
as
to
that
martin
good
men
be
scarce
and
ever
hard
to
come
by
moreover
these
scum
are
a
means
to
an
end
d
see
how
so
just
that
martin
says
he
glancing
at
me
in
his
furtive
manner
a
means
to
an
end
what
end
ah
who
may
tell
martin
he
sighed
shaking
his
head
now
when
i
would
have
questioned
him
further
he
put
me
off
thus
with
side
answers
until
we
were
come
to
the
waterside
which
is
called
deptford
creek
here
having
seen
the
others
safe
embarked
we
took
boat
also
and
were
soon
rowing
between
the
huge
bulk
of
ships
where
dim
lights
burned
and
whence
came
ever
and
anon
the
sound
of
voices
the
rattle
of
a
hawser
a
snatch
of
song
and
the
like
as
we
paddled
betwixt
the
vast
hulls
presently
we
were
beneath
the
towering
stern
of
a
great
ship
and
glancing
up
at
this
lofty
structure
brave
with
and
gilding
i
read
the
name
the
faithfull
friend
at
a
word
from
adam
the
oars
were
unshipped
and
we
glided
alongside
her
side
where
hung
a
ladder
up
which
i
followed
adam
forthwith
she
was
a
great
ship
as
i
say
of
some
two
hundred
tons
at
least
with
high
forecastle
and
lofty
stern
though
i
saw
little
else
ere
at
a
sign
from
adam
i
followed
him
down
the
where
taking
a
flickering
lanthorn
that
hung
from
a
he
led
me
a
clutter
of
stores
not
yet
stowed
past
the
grim
shapes
of
great
ordnance
and
so
down
and
down
to
a
noisome
place
beneath
the
orlop
is
not
over
sweet
martin
says
he
but
then
never
is
you
mind
but
you
grow
used
to
it
in
time
shipmate
unless
instead
o
swallowing
this
unholy
reek
you
swallow
your
pride
and
as
master
mate
i
no
knowledge
of
navigation
says
i
but
i
enough
for
the
two
of
us
martin
is
a
comrade
at
my
back
i
need
what
the
word
no
says
i
mighty
short
as
you
will
shipmate
he
sighed
as
you
will
pride
and
go
well
together
which
said
he
brought
me
to
a
dark
unlovely
hole
abaft
the
mizzen
is
none
too
clean
martin
says
he
casting
the
light
round
the
dingy
place
but
that
shall
be
remedied
and
godby
shall
bring
ye
bedding
and
the
like
so
although
plaguy
dark
and
wi
rats
still
despite
the
stench
you
lie
snug
as
your
pride
will
permit
of
as
for
me
shipmate
i
shall
scarce
close
an
eye
till
we
be
clear
o
the
downs
so
is
a
man
i
shall
be
this
next
two
days
heigho
so
martin
i
send
godby
below
with
all
you
lack
saying
which
penfeather
turned
and
groping
his
way
into
the
darkness
left
me
scowling
at
the
flickering
lanthorn
chapter
xv
telleth
of
a
nameless
black
ship
and
now
within
my
gloomy
by
flickering
lanthorn
i
passed
many
weary
hours
while
all
about
me
was
a
stir
and
bustle
a
confused
sound
made
up
of
many
as
the
tread
of
feet
the
sound
of
hoarse
voices
now
faint
and
far
and
anon
clear
and
loud
the
scrape
of
a
fiddle
snatches
of
rough
song
the
ceaseless
ring
and
tap
of
hammers
a
very
babel
that
telling
of
life
and
action
made
my
gloomy
prison
the
harder
to
endure
and
here
mindful
of
what
is
to
follow
i
do
think
it
well
to
describe
in
few
words
the
place
wherein
i
lay
it
was
indeed
a
very
just
below
the
orlop
some
ten
feet
square
or
thereabouts
shut
in
bulkheads
mighty
solid
and
strong
but
with
a
crazy
door
so
as
to
leave
a
good
three
inches
it
and
the
flooring
it
had
been
a
as
i
guessed
and
judging
by
the
reek
that
reached
me
above
the
stench
of
the
bilge
had
of
late
held
rancid
fat
of
some
sort
just
abaft
the
mizzen
it
lay
and
hard
against
the
massy
for
i
could
hear
the
creek
and
groan
of
the
pintles
as
the
rudder
swung
to
the
tide
against
one
bulkhead
i
had
contrived
a
rough
bunk
with
divers
planks
and
barrels
the
which
with
mattress
and
bedding
was
well
enough
now
opposite
my
berth
within
easy
reach
of
my
hand
was
a
the
which
by
some
trick
of
the
grain
had
much
the
look
of
a
great
staring
eye
insomuch
that
having
no
better
employ
i
fell
to
improving
on
nature
handiwork
with
my
knife
carving
and
trimming
around
it
and
in
betwixt
my
sleeping
my
eating
and
drinking
for
adam
and
godby
kept
me
excellent
well
supplied
i
would
betake
me
to
my
carving
and
fashioning
of
this
eye
and
with
my
initials
below
it
the
which
foolish
business
fond
and
futile
though
it
was
served
in
no
small
measure
to
abate
my
consuming
impatience
and
the
dreary
tedium
howbeit
on
the
third
day
my
situation
becoming
unbearable
i
stumbled
out
from
my
and
groping
my
way
past
kegs
and
barrels
in
place
against
the
rolling
of
the
vessel
i
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
orlop
here
i
must
needs
pause
for
dim
though
it
was
the
light
from
the
open
scuttle
nigh
blinded
me
in
a
while
my
eyes
growing
strong
i
got
me
to
the
where
again
i
must
stay
to
shade
my
eyes
by
reason
of
the
radiance
that
poured
through
an
open
glancing
around
after
some
while
i
saw
no
one
and
wondered
for
here
was
the
main
ten
great
pieces
a
side
i
counted
with
ports
for
divers
more
i
was
yet
wondering
at
the
emptiness
about
me
when
i
heard
sudden
uproar
from
the
deck
above
my
head
shouts
cries
a
rush
and
patter
of
many
feet
and
above
all
furious
hail
wondering
i
came
to
the
open
port
and
leaning
out
saw
it
was
evening
with
a
heavy
mist
creeping
down
upon
the
waters
and
through
the
mist
loomed
a
great
black
ship
drifting
lubberly
across
our
hawse
louder
and
more
furious
grew
the
shouting
above
answered
by
a
hail
aboard
the
great
black
craft
as
broadside
on
she
swung
towards
us
and
now
creeping
in
the
mist
i
beheld
a
small
boat
with
a
great
shapeless
bundle
in
the
and
rowed
by
a
single
waterman
who
swung
easily
to
his
oars
scanning
now
the
faithful
friend
now
the
great
black
ship
like
one
who
bided
the
inevitable
crash
sudden
i
heard
the
roar
of
one
of
penfeather
pistols
followed
by
his
voice
up
raised
in
vicious
and
glancing
up
saw
the
black
ship
right
aboard
of
us
and
braced
myself
for
the
impact
came
a
shock
a
quiver
of
creaking
timbers
and
the
groan
of
our
straining
hawsers
as
the
black
ship
falling
off
drifted
by
in
a
roaring
storm
of
oaths
and
blasphemy
now
when
her
battered
was
nigh
lost
in
the
mist
bethinking
me
of
the
boat
i
had
seen
i
glanced
about
and
beheld
matter
that
set
me
wondering
for
he
was
the
fellow
plying
his
oars
with
a
will
and
so
near
that
i
might
have
tossed
a
biscuit
aboard
him
moreover
the
great
misshapen
bundle
had
lain
in
the
was
there
no
longer
which
set
me
mightily
long
after
man
and
boat
were
swallowed
up
in
the
fog
i
sat
there
lost
in
thought
insomuch
that
i
started
to
feel
a
hearty
clap
on
the
shoulder
and
turning
beheld
godby
a
pair
of
great
gold
rings
in
his
ears

godby
says
i
did
ye
chance
to
see
aught
of
a
boat
carrying
a
great
bundle
in
the
and
rowed
by
a
man
in
a
red
cap
nary
a
blink
why
i
wondering
what
came
of
that
same
bundle
hove
overboard
belike
pal
there
many
a
strange
thing
goes
out
to

from
hereabouts

belike
you
right
says
i
sir
rupert
ashore
to
meet
her
ladyship
so
you
free
to
come
deck
if
so
minded
nay
i
bide
where
i
am
godby
why
then
come
clap
your
eye
on
my
beauties
here
guns
six
culverins
and
sakers
and
yonder
astern
two
basilisks
as
shall
work
ye
death
and
destruction
at
two
or
three
thousand
paces
deck
amidships
i
divers
goodly
pieces
as
minions
falcons
and
patereros
with
murderers
mounted
aft
to
sweep
the
waist
for
her
size
she
well
armed
is
the
friend
thus
godby
as
he
led
me
from
gun
to
gun
slapping
hand
on
breech
or
trunnion
and
as
i
hearkened
was
hard
to
recognise
the
merry
peddler
in
this
short
square
gunner
who
spake
with
tongue
hitched
ever
and
anon
at
the
broad
belt
of
his
galligaskins
and
rolled
in
his
gait
already
she
a
fair
ship
says
i
seating
myself
on
one
of
the
great
guns
mounted
astern
she
is
so
there
no
finer
sailed
from
deptford
pool
which
is
saying
much
split
me
if
it
is
though
when
all
said
martin
i
could
wish
for
twenty
more
men
to
do
justice
to
my
noble
guns
aye
thirty
at
the
least
are
we
so
short
we
carry
but
ninety
and
two
all
told
pal
which
considering
my
guns
is
pity
aye
vast
pity
plague
me
else
leave
me
shorthanded
to
serve
my
guns
should
they
be
necessary
which
is
fair
and
likely
martin
and
black
rogues
they
are
says
i
never
clapped
eyes
on
worse
pal
kick
me
endwise
else
but
captain
adam
the
man
for
such
and
i
mean
to
work
daily
each
and
every
at
my
guns
as
soon
as
we
be
well
at
sea
ah
there
soundeth
toby
hudd
pipe
all
hands
on
deck
this
should
be
her
ladyship
coming
aboard
so
here
me
aloft
and
you
alow
and
good
luck
to
both
pal
saying
which
he
nodded
gave
a
hitch
to
his
wide
galligaskins
and
rolled
away
now
coming
to
the
i
have
mentioned
i
must
needs
pause
there
awhile
to
look
out
across
the
misty
river
already
darkening
to
evening
and
thus
presently
beheld
a
boat
vague
and
blurred
at
first
but
as
it
drew
nearer
saw
in
the
four
gallants
who
laughed
and
talked
gaily
enough
and
the
muffled
forms
of
two
women
and
in
one
from
the
bold
free
carriage
of
her
head
i
recognised
despite
hood
and
cloak
my
lady
joan
brandon
nay
as
the
boat
drew
in
i
heard
the
sweet
vital
tones
of
her
voice
and
with
this
in
my
ears
i
caught
up
my
lanthorn
and
so
descended
to
the
orlop
now
as
i
paused
at
the
narrow
scuttle
that
gave
down
to
my
noxious
i
thought
to
hear
a
step
somewhere
in
the
gloom
below
ha
godby
says
i
are
you
down
there
man
but
getting
no
answer
i
descended
the
ladder
bethinking
me
of
the
rats
whereof
i
had
no
lack
of
company
and
coming
into
my
closed
the
rickety
door
and
having
supped
cast
myself
down
upon
my
bed
and
blew
out
the
light
and
despite
the
rustle
and
scutter
away
there
in
the
dark
beyond
my
crazy
door
i
was
very
soon
asleep
and
in
my
sleep
what
must
i
dream
of
but
rats
with
eyes
that
glared
in
the
dark
that
crawled
ever
nearer
while
one
that
crept
upon
my
bosom
grew
and
swelled
into
a
great
fellow
with
a
steel
hook
in
place
of
one
hand
a
face
with
flashing
white
teeth
and
glowing
eyes
that
peered
close
ere
eyes
and
teeth
vanished
and
i
sunk
down
and
down
into
a
black
emptiness
of
dreamless
slumber
chapter
xvi
tells
how
we
were
dogged
by
the
black
ship
i
awoke
in
panic
and
leaping
up
groped
in
the
until
my
eager
fingers
closed
on
the
haft
of
the
under
my
pillow
and
with
this
naked
in
my
hand
i
crouched
awaiting
i
knew
not
what
for
all
about
me
was
direful
sound
groans
and
cries
with
wailings
long
drawn
out
in
shuddering
complaint
then
all
at
once
my
panic
was
lost
in
sudden
great
content
and
thrusting
away
the
knife
i
took
flint
and
steel
and
therewith
lighted
my
lanthorn
since
now
indeed
i
knew
these
dismal
sounds
nought
but
the
creak
and
groan
of
the
stout
ship
the
voice
of
her
travail
as
she
rose
to
the
seas
and
as
i
hearkened
every
individual
timber
seemed
to
find
a
voice
and
what
with
this
and
the
uneasy
pitching
and
rolling
of
the
ship
i
judged
we
were
well
under
weigh
and
beyond
the
this
bethinking
me
of
the
damage
we
had
sustained
from
the
great
black
ship
set
me
to
wondering
insomuch
that
i
reached
for
my
lanthorn
minded
to
steal
on
deck
that
i
might
know
our
whereabouts
and
if
it
were
day
or
night
since
here
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
it
was
always
night
so
as
i
say
i
reached
for
the
lanthorn
then
paused
as
above
all
other
sounds
rose
a
cheery
hail
and
under
the
door
was
the
flicker
of
a
light
hereupon
i
opened
the
door
though
with
strangely
awkward
fingers
and
thus
espied
godby
lurching
towards
me
what
pal
says
he
sitting
beside
me
on
my
berth
and
setting
down
the
food
and
drink
he
had
brought
are
ye
waking
at
last
have
i
slept
long
godby
you
slept
a
full
thirty
hours
thirty
hours
godby
split
me
crosswise
else
pal
mighty
strange
says
i
reaching
for
the
flask
he
had
brought
for
i
felt
my
mouth
bitterly
parched
and
dry
while
added
to
the
consuming
thirst
my
head
throbbed
miserably
well
here
we
be
pal
clear
o
the
river
this
twelve
hours
and
more
and
this
is
a
ship
aye
by
hokey
a
sailer
so
true
on
a
wind
so
sweet
to
her
helm
and
master
adam
worthy
of
her
blister
me
else
is
strange
i
should
sleep
so
long
says
i
clasping
my
aching
head
why
you
wise
to
sleep
all
ye
can
pal
seeing
there
be
nought
better
to
do
here
i
the
dark
says
he
setting
out
the
viands
before
me
what
no
appetite
i
shook
my
head
lord
love
ye
the
dark
and
the
curst
reek
o
this
place
pal
come
aloft
bowmon
the
fine
folk
ha
found
their
yet
nor
like
to
while
this
wind
holds
so
come
aloft
wi
godby
nothing
loth
i
rose
and
stumbled
towards
the
ladder
marvelling
to
find
my
hands
and
feet
so
unwieldy
as
i
climbed
the
higher
i
went
the
more
the
rolling
and
pitching
of
the
ship
grew
on
me
so
that
when
at
last
i
dragged
myself
out
on
deck
it
was
no
wonder
to
find
the
weather
very
blusterous
and
with
ever
and
anon
clouds
of
white
spray
lashing
aboard
out
of
the
hissing
dark
with
much
wind
that
piped
shrill
and
high
in
cordage
and
rigging
being
sheltered
by
the
high
bulwark
hard
beside
the
ladder
i
leaned
awhile
to
stare
about
me
and
drink
in
great
draughts
of
sweet
clean
air
so
that
in
a
little
my
head
grew
easier
and
the
heaviness
passed
from
me
ever
and
anon
the
moon
peeped
through
wrack
of
flying
cloud
by
whose
pale
beam
i
caught
glimpses
of
bellying
sails
towering
aloft
with
their
indefinable
mass
of
gear
and
rigging
and
the
heel
and
lift
of
her
looming
forecastle
as
the
stately
vessel
rose
to
the
heaving
seas
or
plunged
in
a
white
smother
of
foam
she
rides
well
roared
godby
in
my
ear
aha
here
duck
of
a
ship
pal
where
adam
i
questioned
poop
lord
love
ye
it
little
sleep
he
had
since
we
hove
anchor
pal
he
got
it
into
his
head
as
being
dogged
dogged
man
by
what
by
that
same
great
black
ship
as
fouled
us
he
has
so
pal
roast
me
else
but
come
your
ways
so
saying
godby
climbed
to
the
and
i
after
him
and
mounting
the
presently
came
on
penfeather
peering
hard
over
our
lee
ha
is
it
you
shipmate
says
he
drawing
me
out
of
the
wind
look
yonder
d
see
aught
of
a
rag
o
sail
martin
following
his
pointing
finger
i
stared
away
into
the
distance
across
a
tumbling
spume
of
waters
vague
in
the
d
glimpse
aught
martin
nothing
adam
wait
for
the
moon
shipmate
now
look
yonder
as
the
light
grew
i
swept
the
distant
horizon
with
my
eyes
until
all
at
once
against
the
night
i
saw
the
sheen
of
distant
canvas
that
gleamed
and
was
gone
again
as
a
cloud
veiled
the
moon
you
saw
it
martin
plainly
says
i
whereupon
he
sprang
away
to
the
men
at
the
helm
came
the
hoarse
roar
of
and
decks
and
waist
below
seemed
alive
with
scurrying
dim
figures
and
now
was
a
chorus
of
shouts
and
as
the
faithful
friend
obedient
to
his
commands
swung
off
upon
an
altered
course
godby
says
adam
beckoning
us
where
stood
the
compass
or
bittacle
as
she
bears
now
we
should
be
nigh
enough
yon
curst
ship
to
learn
more
of
her
by
peep
o
dawn
aye
and
then
then
you
shall
try
what
you
can
do
wi
one
o
those
long
guns
yours
lord
love
ye
that
the
spirit
cried
godby
hitching
joyously
at
his
broad
belt
all
i
asks
is
a
fair
light
and
no
favour
and
you
have
the
middle
watch
godby
man
so
i
get
a
wink
sleep
says
adam
but
do
you
call
me
so
soon
as
we
raise
her
hull
as
for
you
martin
you
have
slept
your
fill
i
judge
and
yet
i
plaguy
drowsy
still
says
i
there
a
spare
berth
in
the
coach
comrade
an
you
so
minded
nay
adam
i
watch
awhile
with
godby
good
you
keen
eyes
martin
use
says
he
and
goes
down
the
ladder
forthwith
and
now
pacing
the
lofty
poop
beside
godby
i
was
aware
that
the
faithful
friend
was
dark
fore
and
aft
not
a
light
twinkled
anywhere
how
comes
this
godby
says
i
pointing
to
the
dim
shapes
of
the
great
stern
lanthorns
above
us
orders
we
been
dark
these
two
nights
and
yet
if
yon
craft
is
what
we
think
seem
she
follows
us
by
smell
pal
smell
as
how
say
you
says
i
last
night
she
was
fair
to
be
seen
having
closed
us
during
the
day
so
out
go
our
lights
and
up
goes
our
helm
and
we
stand
away
from
her
at
dawn
she
was
nowhere
and
yet
here
she
is
again
if
yon
ship
be
the
same
which
we
shall
learn
in
an
hour
or
so
godby
aye
if
she
do
smell
us
and
bear
away
from
us
and
yet
she
must
be
a
clean
fast
vessel
but
we
overhaul
her
going
roomer
or
on
a
bowline
roomer
speak
plain
godby
i
no
mariner
time
teach
ye
pal
now
means
and
means
and
means
wi
a
and
that
means
going
away
from
the
wind
or
the
wind
astarn
of
us
whiles
a
bowline
means
agin
the
wind
d
see
godby
is
hard
to
believe
you
that
same
peddler
i
fell
in
with
at
the
why
i
a
cove
as
adapts
himself
according
give
me
a
pack
and
i
all
peddler
and
in
it
me
a
ship
and
i
all
mariner
to
handle
her
sweet
and
kind
and
lay
ye
a
course
wi
any
though
guns
is
my
meat
fifteen
year
i
followed
the
sea
and
a
man
is
apt
to
learn
a
little
in
such
time
so
here
stand
i
this
day
not
only
gunner
but
master
mate
beside
of
as
tight
a
ship
maugre
the
crew
as
ever
sailed
and
all
along
o
that
same
chance
meeting
at
the
and
though
a
friend
of
bym
you
knew
little
of
adam
penfeather
little
enough
joel
be
no
talker
but
it
do
seem
jo
was
one
of
the
once
when
penfeather
saved
his
life
and
that
years
agone
so
joel
comes
home
and
sets
up
marriage
and
what
not
when
one
day
lately
master
adam
walks
into
the
malt
and
no
whit
changed
for
all
the
years
save
his
white
hair
and
here
comes
rain
and
wind
says
i
as
the
stout
ship
reeled
and
plunged
to
the
howling
gust
no
roared
godby
above
the
piping
tumult
not
real
wind
pal
a
stiffish
breeze
jolly
capful
slowly
the
night
wore
away
and
therewith
the
buffeting
wind
gentled
somewhat
gradually
in
the
east
was
a
pale
glimmer
that
growing
showed
great
black
masses
of
torn
cloud
scudding
fast
above
our
reeling
mastheads
and
all
about
us
a
troubled
sea
but
as
the
light
grew
look
how
i
might
nowhere
could
i
descry
aught
of
any
ship
upon
that
vast
horizon
of
foaming
waters
ha
says
godby
venting
huge
sigh
there
to
be
no
play
for
my
guns
this
day
nay
but
says
i
mighty
perplexed
what
come
of
her
she
could
never
have
marked
our
change
of
course
at
the
distance
and
was
black
dark
beside
and
we
bore
no
lights
mayhap
she
smelt
us
pal
as
i
said
afore
howbeit
is
beyond
me
cram
me
wi
else
now
as
he
spoke
up
came
the
sun
turning
lowering
sky
and
tempestuous
ocean
to
glory
every
ragged
cloud
became
as
it
were
streaming
banners
enwrought
of
scarlet
and
gold
every
foaming
billow
a
rolling
splendour
insomuch
that
i
stood
awed
by
the
very
beauty
of
it
all
i
love
the
good
kind
earth
wi
its
green
grass
and
flowers
a
peep
is
a
fair
for
a
man
when
all
done
and
said
but
yonder
pal
ah
there
glory
for
ye
many
the
time
watched
it
dawn
and
sunset
and
minding
all
the
goodly
ships
and
the
jolly
lads
as
are
down
below
at
such
times
it
do
seem
to
me
as
if
all
the
good
and
glory
of
came
aloft
for
eyes
to
see
awhile
howbeit
is
a
noble
pal
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
amen
and
by
that
same
token
the
wind
veering
which
meaneth
a
spell
and
i
must
trim
meantime
do
you
rouse
master
adam
and
here
setting
hands
to
mouth
godby
roared
high
above
the
wind
watch
ho
watch
brace
about
bowse
away
there
as
i
crossed
the
deck
up
the
poop
ladder
comes
adam
himself
his
red
seaman
bonnet
about
his
ears
and
a
under
his
arm
is
as
i
thought
martin
says
he
pinching
his
chin
and
scowling
away
to
leeward
she
changed
course
as
we
did
nay
but
adam
how
should
she
know
we
changed
and
the
night
so
black
very
easily
shipmate
by
means
of
a
light
we
bore
no
lights
adam
none
the
less
someone
aboard
this
ship
signalled
yon
black
craft
by
means
of
a
lanthorn
is
beyond
doubt
and
why
should
she
follow
us
think
ye
why
am

a
marked
man

i
been
dogged
hither
and
yon
across
seas

into
the
coach
and
i
tell

soon

accursed
topsails

i
as
we
climbed
from
the
lofty
poop
you
think
she
will
dog
us
still
then
i
know
it
martin
says
he
gloomily
and
so
brought
me
into
a
smallish
cabin
under
the
poop
here
were
bunks
to
larboard
and
starboard
with
a
table
furnished
with
calendars
charts
a
an
astrolabe
with
globes
and
the
like
while
against
the
walls
stood
rows
of
calivers
musquetoons
and
fusees
set
in
racks
very
orderly
aye
shipmate
says
he
noting
my
gaze
every
firelock
aboard
is
either
here
or
in
the
i
the
below
and
our
powder
is
all
stored
well
aft
by
reason
that
i
am
a
cautious
man
d
see
sit
ye
martin
now
as
to
this
black
ship
first
of
all
she
fouls
us
in
the
river
the
which
was
no
accident
martin
though
just
what
the
motive
was
i
yet
second
as
she
drifted
past
us
whom
should
i
see
aboard
her
but
abnegation
mings
and
pulled
trigger
a
moment
too
late
but
winged
another
o
the
rogues
third
when
we
repaired
our
damage
and
got
us
clear
of
the
river
what
should
we
see
but
this
same
black
ship
hove
short
waiting
us
for
she
presently
stands
after
us
and
so
she
dogged
us
ever
since
and
so
dog
us
she
will
to
the
world
end
unless
i
can
bring
her
to
action
she
a
fighting
ship
by
her
looks
and
heavily
armed
says
i
so

we
martin
and
our
men

says
he
pinching
his
chin
there
it
is
martin

is

all
this
crew
there
are
no
more
than
twenty
men

what
of
the
captain
sir
rupert
dering
that
martin
says
penfeather
snapping
his
fingers
a
very
fool
d
see
a
bladder
of
air
like
his
three
fellows
so
we
have
four
gentlemen
aboard
adam
aye
princocks
all
that
do
nothing
but
vie
in
court
to
her
ladyship
now
martin
what
with
one
thing
or
another
and
this
ship
on
our
heels
in
especial
there
stir
and
disaffection
among
the
crew
o
corners
that
i
do
like
and
which
is
apt
to
spread
unless
looked
to
wherefore
this
morning
i
ordered
a
certain
rascal
fifty
lashes
athwart
a
gun
but
the
had
laid
on
but
poor
ten
and
the
fellow
roaring
lustily
when
into
the
cometh
my
lady
in
mighty
taking
and
seeing
the
back
a
little
bloody
ordered
him
freed
and
thereafter
cossets
him
dainties
from
her
own
table
lord
love
ye
which
cometh
o
women
aboard
ship
and
here
adam
sighed
mighty
dismal
why
then
says
i
here
work
for
me
belike
as
how
martin
nay
leave
it
to
me
being
little
better
than
rogue
myself
i
should
know
how
to
outmatch
roguery
meaning
you
spy
on
shipmate
and
lie
and
cozen
and
join
fellowship
with
if
need
be
howbeit
there
aught
afoot
i
bottom
it
one
rascally
fashion
or
is
desperate
risk
martin
and
should
they
suspicion
you
why
look
adam
my
life
none
so
sweet
or
precious
that
i
cherish
it
in
lavender
besides
i
a
feeling
i
may
not
die
until
at
least
not
yet
wait
says
he
as
i
rose
bide
a
while
martin
and
opening
a
locker
beneath
his
bunk
he
took
thence
a
shirt
of
fine
like
that
he
himself
wore
shaking
my
head
i
would
have
put
it
by
but
he
caught
my
arm
in
his
powerful
grip
and
shook
me
insistent
take
it
martin
says
he
take
it
man
is
easy
and
pleasant
as
any
glove
yet
mighty
efficacious
point
or
edge
and
you
go
where
knives
are
sudden
stay
then
take
it
for
my
sake
shipmate
since
trusty
comrades
be
few
and
mighty
hard
come
by
so
in
the
end
i
did
it
on
beneath
my
doublet
and
found
it
to
irk
me
nothing
and
now
what
he
questioned
as
i
opened
the
door
sleep
says
i
yawning
there
a
bunk
yonder
martin
says
he
eyeing
me
narrowed
lids
nay
i
for
my
adam
you
seem
to
sleep
much
and
mighty
well
despite
stench
and
rats
shipmate
i
grown
used
to
says
i
with
another
yawn
and
as
to
sleeping
i
do
little
else
of
late
is
the
dark
belike
or
bad
air
or
lack
of
exercise
now
as
i
rose
to
be
gone
the
deck
seemed
to
heave
oddly
beneath
my
feet
and
the
cabin
to
swing
dizzily
round
so
that
i
must
needs
grip
at
the
table
to
steady
myself
while
adam
peered
at
me
through
a
haze
as
it
were
what
here
martin
are
ye
sick
he
questioned
a
vertigo
i
mumbled
i
into
the
air
in
a
little
the
dizziness
abating
i
got
me
out
on
deck
and
found
in
the
rushing
wind
mighty
comfort
and
refreshment
while
adam
steadied
me
with
his
arm
let
be
says
i
shaking
off
his
hold
was
nought
i
go
sleep
again
and
waiting
for
no
more
i
stumbled
down
the
but
even
as
i
went
the
haze
seemed
to
close
about
me
thicker
than
ever
and
groping
my
way
to
the
ship
side
i
sank
across
the
bulwark
and
was
miserably
sick
this
agony
passing
i
made
my
way
below
until
i
reached
the
orlop
but
now
feeling
my
sickness
upon
me
again
i
crept
away
into
a
dark
corner
and
cast
me
down
there
and
lying
thus
in
my
misery
i
little
by
little
became
aware
of
someone
weeping
hard
by
a
desolate
sobbing
very
pitiful
to
hear
insomuch
that
maugre
my
weakness
i
got
up
and
going
whence
this
sobbing
proceeded
presently
came
on
a
small
huddled
figure
and
stooping
saw
it
was
a
little
lad
at
my
step
he
started
to
his
knees
elbow
upraised
as
if
expecting
a
blow
why
d
weep
boy
i
questioned
what
your
trouble
nowt
says
he
cowering
away
but
taking
him
by
his
little
thin
shoulders
i
lifted
him
into
the
dim
light
of
a
swinging
lanthorn
and
looked
into
a
small
pallid
face
swollen
and
disfigured
by
cuts
and
bruises
wrought
by
some
brutal
hand
who
did
this
i
demanded
nobody
says
he
gulping
a
sob
who
are
you
boy
how
old
are
you
child
at
this
he
stared
up
at
me
out
of
his
swollen
eyes
then
covering
his
face
in
ragged
sleeve
broke
into
convulsive
sobbing
what
now
says
i
drawing
him
beside
me
what
now
she
used
to
call
me
my
mother
and
here
his
grief
choked
him
now
as
i
looked
down
upon
this
little
pitiful
creature
i
forgot
my
sickness
in
sudden
fierce
anger
boy
said
i
who
been
flogging
you
speak
red
andy
he
gasped
be
always
a
doin
of
it
be
wish
i
was
dead
like
my
mother
jim
ho
jimmy
roared
a
voice
from
somewhere
in
the
gloom
forward
jim
plague
seize
ye
show
a
leg
will
here
and
before
i
could
stay
him
the
boy
started
up
and
pattered
away
drying
his
tears
as
he
ran
now
as
i
lay
there
i
kicked
off
my
shoes
and
hearkened
expectant
thus
all
at
once
i
heard
a
murmur
rising
to
a
wail
that
ended
in
a
shrill
scream
and
getting
to
my
feet
i
crept
stealthily
forward
past
main
and
foremasts
i
crept
past
dark
and
and
so
to
a
crack
of
light
and
clapping
my
eye
thereto
espied
two
fellows
rolling
dice
and
beyond
them
the
boy
his
hands
lashed
miserably
to
a
staple
in
the
bulkhead
his
little
body
writhing
under
the
cruel
blows
of
a
wielded
by
a
great
fellow
now
in
my
many
desperate
affrays
with
my
those
beasts
i
had
learned
that
it
is
the
first
blow
that
tells
wherefore
groping
for
the
latch
i
stealthily
opened
the
door
and
or
ever
the
fellow
was
aware
i
was
upon
him
from
behind
and
giving
him
no
chance
for
defence
i
smote
him
a
buffet
under
the
ear
that
tumbled
him
against
the
bulkhead
whence
he
sank
to
hands
and
knees
then
while
he
strove
to
rise
i
kicked
him
down
again
and
setting
my
foot
upon
his
chest
caught
up
the
he
had
dropped
and
beat
him
therewith
until
he
roared
until
he
groaned
and
lay
writhing
face
hid
beneath
his
crossed
arms
then
whipping
out
my
knife
i
fronted
his
two
mates
the
one
a
doleful
bony
man
with
a
squint
the
other
a
small
mean
fellow
in
a
striped
shirt
who
closing
one
bright
eye
leered
at
them
with
the
other
all
at
once
he
nodded
and
pointing
from
the
knife
in
my
fist
to
the
fellow
groaning
beneath
my
foot
drew
a
long
thumb
across
his
own
stringy
throat
and
nodded
again
hereupon
i
stooped
above
my
captive
and
set
the
flat
of
my
blade
to
his
forehead
just
below
his
thick
red
hair
dog
i
panted
while
he
glared
up
at
me
beneath
his
bruised
arms
set
so
much
as
a
finger
on
yon
pitiful
brat
again
and
i
cut
a
mark
in
your
shall
last
your
life
out
his
throat
cully
quick
the
word
breathed
a
voice
in
my
ear
but
now
as
i
turned
and
the
little
fellow
leapt
nimbly
back
was
a
creaking
and
groaning
of
the
ladder
that
led
to
the
above
and
down
comes
a
pair
of
prodigious
stout
legs
and
after
these
a
round
body
and
last
of
all
a
great
flat
face
small
of
mouth
small
of
nose
and
with
a
pair
of
little
quick
eyes
that
winked
and
blinked
betwixt
hairless
lids
the
fat
fellow
having
got
him
down
the
ladder
and
with
wondrous
ease
for
one
of
his
bulk
stood
winking
and
blinking
at
me
the
while
he
patted
one
of
his
plump
cheeks
with
plump
fingers
love
my
limbs
says
he
in
soft
voice
perish
and
plague
me
but

the
fat
man
blinking
harder
than
ever
so
bad
as
that

fine
upstanding
cock

thrashed

the
fellow

snarl
and
groan
and
writhing
under
my
feet
and

the

smiling
at
me

as
he
spoke
and
smiling
yet
he
caught
the
boy
ear
and
wrung
it
vicious
thumb
and
finger
whereon
i
whirled
the
but
he
sprang
out
of
reach
with
wondrous
agility
and
stood
patting
plump
cheek
and
smiling
more
kindly
than
ever
the
while
i
cut
the
cords
that
bound
the
boy
wrists
who
with
an
wondering
look
at
me
sped
away
into
the
orlop
and
was
gone
now

says
i
but
hereupon
he
retreated
to
the
ladder
and
i
feeling
my
sickness
upon
me
again
contented
me
by
throwing
the
at
the
fellow
and
stepping
out
backward
clapped
to
the
door
so
with
what
speed
i
might
i
got
me
down
into
the
hold
and
to
my
and
here
i
saw
i
had
left
my
lanthorn
burning
and
found
in
this
light
strange
comfort
now
being
mighty
athirst
i
reached
the
demijohn
from
the
corner
and
drank
deep
but
the
good
water
tasted
ill
on
my
parched
tongue
moreover
the
place
seemed
strangely
close
and
airless
and
i
in
great
heat
wherefore
i
tore
off
my
sleeved
doublet
and
kicking
off
my
shoes
cast
myself
upon
my
miserable
bed
but
now
as
i
lay
blinking
at
the
lanthorn
i
was
seized
of
sudden
great
dread
though
of
what
i
knew
not
and
ever
as
my
drowsiness
increased
so
grew
my
fear
until
and
all
at
once
i
knew
that
the
thing
i
dreaded
was
sleep
and
fain
would
i
have
started
up
but
even
then
sleep
seized
me
and
strive
how
i
would
my
eyes
closed
and
i
fell
into
deep
and
slumber
chapter
xvii
telleth
how
an
eye
watched
me
from
the
dark
it
is
not
my
intention
to
chronicle
all
those
minor
happenings
that
befell
us
at
this
time
lest
my
narrative
prove
and
therefore
tedious
to
the
reader
suffice
it
then
that
the
fair
weather
foretold
by
godby
had
set
in
and
day
by
day
we
stood
on
with
a
favouring
wind
nevertheless
despite
calm
weather
and
propitious
gale
the
disaffection
among
the
crew
waxed
apace
by
reason
of
the
great
black
ship
that
dogged
us
some
holding
her
to
be
a
bloody
pirate
and
others
a
foredooming
us
to
destruction
as
to
myself
never
was
poor
wretch
in
more
woeful
plight
for
in
the
stifling
hold
where
no
ray
of
kindly
sun
might
ever
penetrate
and
void
of
all
human
fellowship
i
became
a
prey
to
wild
unholy
fancies
and
a
bred
of
my
brooding
humours
my
evil
thoughts
seemed
to
take
on
stealthy
shapes
that
haunted
the
fetid
gloom
about
me
shapes
of
horror
and
murder
conjured
up
of
my
own
vengeful
imaginations
an
evil
time
indeed
this
of
long
uneasy
sleepings
of
hateful
dreams
and
ill
wakings
of
sullen
humours
and
a
horror
of
all
companionship
insomuch
that
when
came
godby
or
adam
to
supply
my
daily
wants
i
would
hide
myself
until
they
should
be
gone
thereafter
tossing
feverishly
upon
my
miserable
bed
i
would
brood
upon
my
wrongs
hugging
to
myself
the
thought
of
vengeance
and
joying
in
the
knowledge
that
every
hour
brought
me
the
nearer
its
fulfilment
and
now
it
was
that
i
became
possessed
of
an
uneasy
feeling
that
i
was
not
alone
that
beyond
my
crazy
door
was
a
thing
that
lurked
in
the
gloom
hearkening
for
my
smallest
movement
and
following
on
soundless
feet
whithersoever
i
went
this
unease
so
grew
upon
me
that
when
not
lost
in
fevered
sleep
i
would
lie
with
breath
in
check
listening
to
such
sounds
as
reached
me
above
the
groaning
of
the
vessel
labour
until
the
squeak
and
scutter
of
some
rat
hard
by
or
any
unwonted
rustling
beyond
the
door
would
bring
me
to
an
elbow
in
sweating
panic
to
combat
the
which
sick
fancies
it
became
my
custom
to
steal
up
from
my
fetid
at
dead
of
night
and
to
prowl
about
the
ship
where
none
stirred
save
myself
and
the
drowsy
watch
above
deck
none
the
less
and
go
where
i
would
it
seemed
i
was
haunted
still
that
behind
me
lurked
a
nameless
dread
a
silent
unseen
presence
night
after
night
i
roamed
the
ship
thus
my
fingers
clenched
on
the
knife
in
my
girdle
my
ears
on
the
strain
and
eyes
that
sought
vainly
every
dark
corner
or
patch
of
shadow
at
last
on
a
night
as
i
crouched
beside
a
gun
on
the
i
espied
of
a
sudden
a
shape
dim
and
in
the
gloom
that
flitted
silently
past
me
and
up
the
ladder
to
the
deck
above
up
started
i
knife
in
hand
but
in
my
haste
i
stumbled
over
some
obstacle
and
fell
but
up
the
ladder
i
sprang
in
pursuit
out
into
moonlight
and
hastening
forward
came
face
to
face
with
adam
i
cried
and
sprang
at
him
with
up
lifted
knife
but
as
i
came
he
stepped
aside
incredibly
quick
and
thrusting
out
a
foot
tripped
me
sprawling
easy
shipmate
easy
says
he
thrusting
a
pistol
under
my
nose
lord
love
you
martin
what
would
you
now
so
you
follow
me
will
you
i
panted
you
creep
and
crawl
and
spy
on
me
will
you
neither
one
nor
martin
was
you
climbed
the
gangway
but
now
not
i
martin
not
i
and
as
i
scowled
up
at
him
i
knew
he
spoke
truth
and
a
new
fear
seized
me
and
you
saw
no
one
adam
nothing
no
shape
that
flitted
up
the
ladder
hitherwards
and
no
sound
to
it
never
a
thing
martin
save
yourself
why
then
says
i
clasping
my
temples
why
then
i
mad
how
so
comrade
because
i
followed
i
watched
spied
upon
sleeping
and
waking
aye
but
how
d
know
he
questioned
stooping
to
peer
at
me
i
feel
it
i
known
it
for
days
past
and
i
saw
it
haunted
i
tell
you
who
by
shipmate
aye
i
cried
who
is
it
what
is
a
thing
that
flits
i
the
dark
and
with
never
a
sound
that
watches
and
listens
it
mounted
the
ladder
yonder
scarce
a
moment
since
plain
to
my
sight
yet
i
saw
nothing
martin
and
not
a
soul
stirring
save
the
watch
forward
the
steersman
aft
and
myself
why
then
i
verily
mad
says
i
not
you
shipmate
not
you
is
nought
but
the
solitude
and
darkness
they
take
many
a
man
that
way
so
ha
done
with
martin
my
lady
offer
of
employ
yet
holdeth
good
so
with
me
as
master
mate
say
but
the
word
and
no
says
i
fiercely
come
what
may
i
take
no
service
under
an
accursed
brandon
saying
which
i
got
me
to
my
feet
and
presently
back
to
the
haunted
dark
thus
the
days
dragged
by
all
unmarked
by
me
that
took
no
more
heed
of
time
for
my
fevered
restlessness
gave
place
to
a
heaviness
a
growing
inertia
that
gripped
me
mind
and
body
thus
when
not
lost
in
troubled
sleep
i
would
lie
motionless
staring
dully
at
the
dim
flame
of
the
lanthorn
or
blinking
sightless
on
the
dark
this
strange
sickness
as
hath
been
said
i
then
set
down
to
no
more
than
confinement
and
my
unwholesome
situation
in
the
which
supposition
i
was
very
far
beside
the
mark
as
you
shall
hear
for
there
now
befell
a
thing
that
roused
me
from
my
apathy
once
and
for
all
and
thereby
saved
me
from
miserably
perishing
and
others
with
me
and
the
manner
of
it
thus
on
a
time
as
i
lay
sleep
and
wake
my
glance
and
for
no
reason
in
the
world
chanced
upon
that
in
the
opposite
bulkhead
the
which
as
already
told
i
had
wrought
into
the
likeness
of
a
great
eye
now
as
i
stared
at
it
the
thing
seemed
all
at
once
to
grow
instinct
with
life
and
to
stare
back
at
me
i
continued
to
view
it
dully
enough
until
little
by
little
i
became
aware
of
something
strange
about
it
and
then
as
i
watched
this
that
was
no
more
than
a
the
thing
winked
at
me
thinking
this
but
some
wild
fancy
or
a
trick
of
the
light
i
lay
still
watching
it
beneath
my
lowered
lids
and
thus
i
suddenly
caught
the
glitter
of
the
thing
as
it
moved
and
knew
it
for
a
very
bright
human
eye
that
watched
me
through
the
now
this
may
seem
a
very
small
matter
in
the
telling
but
to
me
at
that
moment
overwrought
by
my
long
sojourn
in
the
dark
it
was
vastly
otherwise
for
maybe
a
full
minute
the
eye
stared
at
me
fixed
and
motionless
and
with
a
piercing
intensity
then
suddenly
was
gone
and
i
lying
there
my
flesh
my
heart
in
a
strange
terror
so
that
i
marvelled
to
find
myself
so
shaken
leaping
up
in
sudden
fierce
anger
i
wrenched
open
the
door
and
rushed
forth
only
to
fall
headlong
over
some
obstacle
and
lying
there
bruised
and
dazed
heard
the
soft
thud
and
scamper
of
rats
in
the
dark
hard
by
so
i
got
me
back
to
my
bunk
and
lying
there
fell
to
a
gloomy
reflection
and
the
more
i
thought
the
fiercer
grew
my
anger
that
any
should
dare
so
to
spy
upon
me
thus
it
was
in
one
of
my
blackest
humours
that
godby
found
me
when
having
set
down
the
victuals
he
had
brought
he
closed
the
crazy
door
and
seated
himself
on
the
cask
that
served
me
as
chair
and
bent
to
peer
at
me
where
i
lay
said
he
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
be
ye
awake
at
last
for
answer
i
cursed
him
heartily
avast
pal
says
he
shaking
his
head
is
in
my
mind
the
devil
aboard
this
ship
and
what
then
i
demanded
angrily
am
i
a
raree
show
to
be
peeped
at
and
watched
and
spied
upon
anan
pal

yonder

since

up
as

rustling

door

under
his
breath
and
whipping
round
knife
in
hand
was
like
a
shoeless
foot
creeping
murder

there
again
speaking
he
tore
open
the
door
and
i
saw
his
knife
flash
as
he
sprang
into
the
darkness
beyond
as
for
me
i
quaffed
my
ale
presently
back
he
comes
claps
to
the
door
mighty
careful
and
sinking
upon
the
upturned
cask

at
his
brow
content

each
of
them
i
the
middle
watch

sleepy
hour
just
afore
dawn
in
a
fair
night
pal
wi
a
calm
sea
these
men
vanish
and
none
to
see
go
and
all
of
prime
and
trusty
the
which
sets
a
cove
to
wondering
who
be
next
but
are
you
sure
they
are
gone
aye
we
sought
alow
and
aloft
all
over
the
ship
save
only
this
hole
o
yourn
the
which
you
might
ha
known
had
ye
slept
less
have
i
slept
so
much
then
pal
you
done
little
else
since
you
came
aboard
seemingly
all
yesterday
as
i
do
know
you
slept
and
never
stirred
nor
took
so
much
as
bite
or
sup
and
i
know
because
while
we
was
a
turning
out
the
hold
and
i
come
and
took
a
look
at
ye
every
now
and
then
and
here
you
like
a
dead
man
but
for
your
snoring
here
strange
thing
and
mighty
strange
for
until
i
came
aboard
i
was
ever
a
wondrous
light
sleeper
godby
why
is
the
stench
o
this
place
faugh
come
aloft
and
take
a
mouthful
o
good
sweet
air
pal
you
say
you
sought
these
men
everywhere
even
down
here
in
the
hold
aye
alow
and
aloft
every
bulkhead
and
timber
from
trucks
to
keelson
and
all
this
time
i
was
asleep
godby
aye
like
a
log
and
breathing
heavily
aye
ye
did
so
pal
groaning
ye
might
call
it
aye
fit
to
chill
a
man
good
blood
and
neither
you
nor
adam
nor
the
others
thought
to
search
this
of
mine
lord
love
ye
no
how
should
three
men
hide
here
three
men
aye
true
enough
says
i
clasping
my
head
to
stay
the
rush
and
hurry
of
my
thoughts
come
aloft
pal
is
a
fair
evening
and
the
fine
folk
all
in
the
great
cabin
come
into
the
air
yes
i
nodded
yes
clear
my
head
and
i
must
think
godby
i
must
think
reach
me
my
doublet
says
i
for
now
i
felt
myself
all
shivering
as
with
cold
so
godby
took
up
the
garment
where
it
lay
and
held
it
out
to
me
but
all
at
once
let
it
fall
and
drawing
back
stood
staring
down
at
it
and
all
with
never
a
word
whiles
i
sat
crouched
upon
my
bed
my
head
between
my
clenched
fists
and
my
mind
reeling
beneath
the
growing
horror
of
the
thought
that
filled
me
and
now
even
as
this
thought
took
dreadful
shape
and
meaning
even
as
suspicion
grew
to
certainty
i
heard
godby
draw
a
gasping
breath
saw
him
reach
a
stealthy
fumbling
hand
behind
him
and
open
the
door
and
then
leaping
backwards
he
was
swallowed
in
the
dark
and
with
a
hurry
of
stumbling
feet
was
gone
but
i
scarcely
heeded
his
going
or
the
manner
of
it
so
stunned
was
i
by
the
sudden
realisation
of
the
terror
that
had
haunted
my
ghastly
slumbers
and
evil
wakings
a
terror
that
if
my
dreadful
speculations
were
true
was
very
real
after
all
a
peril
deadly
and
imminent
the
truth
of
which
i
now
and
feverishly
set
myself
to
prove
beyond
all
doubt
and
reached
for
the
lanthorn
now
in
so
doing
my
foot
caught
in
the
doublet
lying
where
godby
had
dropped
it
and
i
picked
it
up
out
of
the
way
but
as
i
lifted
it
into
the
light
i
let
it
fall
again
even
as
godby
had
done
and
now
staring
down
at
it
felt
my
flesh
suddenly
for
as
it
lay
there
at
my
feet
i
saw
upon
one
sleeve
a
great
dark
stain
that
smeared
it
up
from
wrist
to
elbow
the
hideous
stain
of
blood
chapter
xviii
concerning
the
mark
of
a
bloody
hand
and
how
i
lay
in
the
bilboes
on
suspicion
of
murder
it
was
with
an
effort
at
last
that
i
dragged
my
gaze
from
the
hateful
thing
at
my
feet
only
to
meet
the
wide
stare
of
that
great
eye
my
knife
had
wrought
and
albeit
no
human
eye
now
glittered
there
yet
it
seemed
none
the
less
to
watch
my
every
move
so
persistently
that
i
snatched
off
my
neckerchief
and
pinning
it
against
the
bulkhead
with
my
knife
hid
the
thing
from
sight
which
done
i
spurned
my
doublet
into
a
corner
and
getting
to
hands
and
knees
with
the
light
beside
me
began
my
search
my
bunk
was
formed
of
boards
supported
by
four
casks
and
stretched
the
whole
length
of
my
small
chamber
upon
these
boards
was
a
pallet
covered
by
a
great
blanket
that
hung
down
to
the
very
flooring
lifting
this
i
advanced
the
lanthorn
and
so
began
to
examine
very
narrowly
this
space
beneath
my
bed
and
first
i
noticed
that
the
flooring
hereabouts
was
free
of
dust
as
it
had
been
and
presently
in
the
far
corner
espied
a
blurred
mark
that
as
i
looked
took
grim
form
and
semblance
stooping
nearer
i
stared
at
this
in
the
full
glare
of
the
lanthorn
then
shrank
back
as
well
i
might
for
now
i
saw
this
mark
was
indeed
the
print
of
a
great
bloody
hand
open
at
full
stretch
crouching
thus
i
felt
again
all
the
horror
i
had
known
in
my
dreams
that
dread
of
some
unseen
haunting
presence
seeming
to
breathe
in
the
very
air
about
me
a
feeling
of
some
evil
thing
that
moved
and
crept
in
the
dark
beyond
the
door
of
ears
that
hearkened
to
my
every
move
and
eyes
that
watched
me
unseen
and
this
terror
waxed
and
grew
until
hearing
a
faint
stirring
behind
me
i
whirled
about
in
panic
to
see
the
neckerchief
gently
against
the
bulkhead
where
i
had
pinned
it
and
though
this
was
caused
by
no
more
than
the
motion
of
the
ship
as
i
judged
yet
in
my
then
state
of
mind
i
whipped
out
my
pistol
and
levelling
at
the
pulled
the
trigger
whereon
was
a
mere
flash
in
the
pan
and
no
more
this
of
itself
steadied
me
and
sitting
on
my
bed
i
found
that
the
charge
had
been
withdrawn
laying
by
the
useless
weapon
for
i
had
neither
powder
nor
ball
i
fell
to
profound
meditation
and
now
indeed
many
things
were
plain
here
methought
had
been
the
ghost
here
had
lain
the
murderer
of
three
men
here
in
the
one
and
only
safe
place
for
him
in
the
whole
ship
beneath
my
bed
the
while
i
lay
there
in
drugged
sleep
it
would
be
simple
matter
to
steal
hither
in
my
absence
and
drug
my
food
and
would
explain
the
strange
nausea
had
so
afflicted
me
of
late
here
then
i
had
the
secret
of
my
sleeping
my
vapours
and
black
humours
here
the
explanation
of
my
evil
dreams
and
ghastly
visions
while
death
in
human
guise
crept
about
my
couch
or
stooped
above
my
unconscious
form
but
i
reasoned
i
was
not
to
be
murdered
since
i
was
of
more
use
to
him
alive
than
dead
and
for
three
reasons
as
i
judged
first
that
in
his
stealthy
comings
and
goings
he
might
be
mistaken
for
me
and
thus
left
alone
secondly
that
dressed
in
my
habit
he
might
haply
father
his
crimes
on
me
and
thirdly
that
i
lying
here
drugged
and
asleep
might
afford
him
the
one
and
only
escape
from
pursuit
and
capture
and
yet
thinks
i
what
manner
of
man
or
rather
devil
should
this
be
who
clad
in
my
doublet
could
make
away
with
three
lusty
fellows
and
no
one
the
wiser
hereupon
and
all
in
a
flash
i
seemed
to
see
again
the
great
black
ship
drifting
down
on
us
in
the
river
and
the
man
who
rowed
the
skiff
with
the
misshapen
bundle
in
the
the
bundle
that
had
vanished
so
inexplicably
by
the
living
god
says
i
in
a
whisper
here
an
end
to
all
the
mystery
at
last
and
so
remained
a
great
while
sitting
motionless
on
my
bed
being
mightily
cast
down
and
utterly
confounded
rousing
myself
at
last
i
drew
my
knife
from
the
bulkhead
and
put
out
the
light
then
very
cautiously
set
wide
the
door
and
thus
lapped
in
the
pitchy
dark
and
mighty
thankful
for
the
good
beneath
my
jerkin
stood
holding
my
breath
to
listen
but
hearing
no
more
than
the
usual
stir
and
bustle
of
the
ship
i
stole
forward
silent
in
my
stockinged
feet
and
groping
before
me
with
my
left
hand
the
knife
clenched
in
my
right
began
to
steal
towards
the
ladder
and
now
despite
shirt
of
mail
i
felt
a
cold
chill
that
crept
betwixt
my
twitching
as
i
went
for
that
which
i
feared
was
more
hateful
than
any
knife
howbeit
reaching
the
ladder
i
got
me
to
the
orlop
and
mighty
thankful
and
so
to
the
upper
deck
to
find
a
wondrous
fair
night
breathing
a
sweet
and
balmy
air
and
with
a
round
moon
uprising
against
a
great
plenitude
of
stars
the
moon
was
low
as
yet
and
taking
advantage
of
the
shadows
i
got
me
into
the
gloom
of
the
mainmast
where
the
boats
were
stowed
and
here
being
well
screened
from
chance
view
i
sat
me
down
to
drink
in
the
glory
of
sea
and
sky
and
to
wait
for
chance
of
speech
with
adam
and
huge
joy
was
it
to
behold
these
vast
waters
as
they
heaved
to
a
slumberous
swell
and
all
radiant
with
the
moon
loveliness
or
gazing
aloft
through
the
maze
of
ropes
and
rigging
marvelled
at
the
glory
of
the
heaven
set
with
its
myriad
starry
fires
and
contrasting
all
this
with
the
place
of
black
horror
whence
i
had
come
i
fell
to
a
very
ecstasy
and
now
even
as
i
sat
thus
lost
in
pleasing
wonderment
from
the
hard
by
came
the
sweet
throbbing
melody
of
a
lute
touched
by
skilled
fingers
and
therewith
a
voice
richly
soft
and
plaintive
yet
thrilling
with
that
strange
vital
ring
had
first
arrested
me
and
which
i
should
have
known
the
world
over
so
she
sang
an
air
that
i
knew
not
yet
methought
it
wondrous
sweet
anon
she
breaks
off
all
at
once
and
falls
to
the
song
i
had
heard
her
sing
before
now
viz
a
poor
soul
sat
sighing
by
a
green
willow
tree
now
as
i
hearkened
my
gaze
bent
aloft
the
starry
heavens
grew
all
sudden
blurred
and
misty
on
my
sight
and
i
knew
again
that
deep
yearning
for
a
life
far
different
from
that
i
in
my
blind
selfishness
had
marked
out
for
myself
here
truly
thinks
i
is
one
of
of
stars
the
which
are
good
times
being
times
of
promise
for
all
that
are
blessed
with
eyes
to
see
saving
only
myself
who
though
possessing
eyes
am
yet
not
as
other
men
being
indeed
one
set
apart
and
dedicated
to
a
just
act
of
vengeance
but
for
this
i
too
might
have
been
happy
perchance
and
with
a
hope
of
greater
happiness
to
be
something
the
like
of
this
was
in
my
thoughts
while
the
song
was
and
i
by
tears
that
would
not
be
blinked
away
howbeit
the
song
ending
i
was
aware
of
a
man
voice
something
and
precise
i
vow
and
protest
dear
madam
is
rare
a
night
angelic
and
an
angel
here
to
sing
us
to
an
ecstasy
faith
joan
says
another
voice
your
singing
might
draw
any
heart
out
of
him
sweet
cousin
and
that
is
but
bald
truth
i
vow
my
lady
spoke
a
third
why
then
gentlemen
says
she
laughing
here
an
angel
will
to
bed
ere
so
ill
a
chance
befall
you
now
here
being
minded
to
steal
a
look
upon
her
i
rose
and
creeping
to
the
great
mast
edged
myself
into
the
shadow
and
so
beheld
one
that
crouched
there
already
and
knew
him
for
that
same
fellow
i
had
belaboured
with
the
he
was
staring
up
at
the
and
following
his
look
i
saw
my
lady
stand
leaning
upon
the
rail
her
shapely
figure
outlined
against
the
moonlight
her
face
upraised
to
the
sky
so
stood
she
awhile
the
gentlemen
beside
her
very
brave
in
their
velvets
and
great
periwigs
until
came
her
maid
marjorie
then
she
sighed
acknowledged
the
gentlemen
bows
and
flourishes
with
a
graceful
curtesy
and
bidding
them
a
laughing
went
her
way
her
shapely
arm
about
marjorie
trim
waist
hereupon
the
fellow
uttered
a
sound
a
sigh
and
groan
and
beholding
him
now
as
he
yet
stared
after
her
i
saw
his
face
convulse
and
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
tongued
his
lips
as
made
my
very
gorge
rise
and
i
crept
a
pace
nearer
be
that
you
smiler
says
he
his
gaze
still
fixed
o
mate
yon
a
rare
dainty
bit
a
sweet
armful
smiler
dog
i
cried
in
sudden
choking
fury
at
this
he
leapt
back
hardly
escaping
my
fist
ha
you
again
cries
he
and
with
the
words
sprang
at
me
and
fetched
me
a
staggering
buffet
in
the
mouth
at
this
forgetting
all
prudence
i
closed
with
him
and
heedless
of
his
blows
secured
the
wrestling
grip
i
sought
and
wrenching
him
down
and
across
my
knee
saw
his
face
suddenly
with
the
blood
from
my
cut
mouth
the
while
i
strove
to
choke
him
to
silence
but
he
struggled
mightily
and
thrice
he
cried
murder
in
despite
of
me
whereupon
the
cry
was
taken
up
by
one
here
and
others
there
until
the
very
ship
seemed
to
roar
murder
followed
a
rush
of
feet
a
confusion
of
voices
all
about
me
and
loosing
my
adversary
i
reeled
back
to
the
mast
under
a
rain
of
blows
stand
away
back
all
cried
a
voice
mea
shot
at
the
rogue
and
the
muzzle
of
a
caliver
was
thrust
into
my
face
only
to
be
dashed
aside
as
adam
sprang
before
me
hold
off
says
he
whereupon
they
shrank
back
from
me
one
and
all
before
his
levelled
pistol
and
there
came
a
moment
silence
wherein
i
heard
godby
utter
a
gasp
and
letting
fall
the
caliver
he
stared
at
me
here
no
murderer
ye
fools
says
adam
scowling
round
on
them
is
no
more
than
ha
way
for
sir
rupert
make
way
for
the
captain
there
pray
what
to
do
master
penfeather
demanded
sir
rupert
hasting
forward
with
drawn
sword
and
the
three
gentlemen
behind
him
all
this
riot
nought
but
a
stowaway
rogue
sir
rupert
and
one
beknown
to
me
in
england
ha
says
sir
rupert
stroking
a
curl
of
his
great
peruke
how
cometh
he
brawling
with
the
watch
my
masters
cried
the
fellow
gasping
and
making
great
of
gurgling
and
clasping
his
throat
where
i
had
squeezed
him
sirs
at
my
bloody
face
all
bloodied
i
be
and
nigh
done
for
by
yon
murdering
rogue
here
me
on
my
watch
and
no
thought
harm
and
suddenly
out
o
nowhere
he
takes
him
and
grips
me
from
behind
and
would
ha
murdered
me
as
he
murdered
ha
cried
sir
rupert
the
man
reeks
blood
observe
master
penfeather
and
here
grave
charge
beside
now
as
i
leaned
there
against
the
mast
i
saw
a
figure
flit
down
the
and
fain
would
have
fled
yet
seeing
this
vain
hung
my
head
and
cowered
in
a
very
agony
of
mortified
pride
and
you
know
this
man
you
say
master
adam
questioned
sir
rupert
aye
i
do
sir
for
a
desperate
fellow
and
so
doth
my
lady
brandon
and
yourself
also
ha
bring
him
forward
where
i
may
get
look
of
him
the
which
being
done
sir
rupert
starts
back
with
raised
by
heaven
he
cried
how
cometh
this
fellow
aboard
a
stowaway
as
i
said
sir
quoth
adam
you
mind
him
very
well
it
seemeth
aye
verily
says
sir
rupert
tapping
me
lightly
with
his
sword
as
i
stood
between
my
captors
ha
you
the
rogue
stood
i
the
pillory
aye
i
nodded
scowling
at
his
dainty
person
and
you
the
one
that
set
me
there
is
a
rogue
ingrain
said
sir
rupert
frowning
in
turn
o
a
very
desperate
fellow
as
you
say
master
adam
and
like
enough
the
murderer
we
are
hereupon
i
laughed
and
was
kicked
unseen
therefor
by
adam
my
lady
says
he
turning
where
she
stood
hard
by
you
have
seen
this
fellow
i
think
yes
says
she
readily
and
indeed
cousin
rupert
i
know
more
of
this
of
him
than
you
do
and
very
sure
am
i
he
is
no
murderer
nor
ever
will
be
here
for
a
moment
her
glance
rested
on
me
and
meeting
that
look
i
forgot
my
wounded
vanity
and
degradation
awhile
sweet
my
lady
says
sir
rupert
your
gentle
woman
heart
may
not
brook
scenes
the
like
of
this
go
seek
thy
tender
pillow
and
leave
such
to
us
of
sterner
mould
nay
cousin
my
gentle
woman
heart
knoweth
innocence
from
guilt
methinks
and
here
standeth
innocent
man
stowaway
though
he
be
why
then
as
stowaway
will
i
entreat
him
fair
cousin
master
penfeather
clap
him
in
irons
till
the
morning
away
with
him
nay
i
myself
will
see
him
safely
lodged
here
and
without
further
parley
i
was
led
below
watched
by
the
whole
ship
company
and
so
to
a
dismal
place
abaft
the
lazarette
where
the
armourer
master
taffery
duly
locked
me
into
the
manacles
arm
and
leg
beneath
the
eyes
of
penfeather
and
sir
rupert
who
seeing
me
this
secure
presently
left
me
to
darkness
and
my
solitary
reflections
howbeit
after
some
while
i
heard
the
sound
of
key
turning
and
adam
bearing
a
light
having
locked
the
door
on
us
he
set
down
the
lanthorn
on
the
floor
and
seating
himself
on
the
bench
whereto
i
was
shackled
falls
into
a
passion
of
cursing
both
in
english
spanish
and
indian
for
aught
i
know
for
never
had
i
heard
the
like
words
or
such
deep
fervour
adam
says
i
he
being
at
a
pause
is
hard
to
think
you
were
ever
a
student
of
divinity
hereupon
he
glances
at
me
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
shakes
his
head
your
face
is
bloody
martin
are
ye
hurt
my
belly
empty
adam
why
i
guessed
as
much
shipmate
godby
bringing
ye
the
wherewithal
to
fill
it
in
the
meantime
i
free
you
o
your
bilboes
awhile
though
i
must
lock
you
up
again
that
you
may
be
found
snug
and
secure
in
the
morning
so
saying
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
therewith
set
me
at
liberty
ah
martin
quoth
he
as
i
stretched
myself
why
must
ye
go
of
tumults
above
deck
under
our
very
noses
here
mighty
ill
plight
you
got
yourself
into
and
here
me
how
i
am
to
get
ye
out
again
here
been
murder
done
and
this
coxcombly
captain
hath
got
it
into
his
skull
that
you
the
murderer
aye
and
what
worse
every
soul
aboard
likewise
save
only
godby
and
myself
and
my
lady
says
i
true
shipmate
true
she
spoke
for
ye
as
i
guessed
she
might
and
how
should
you
guess
this
adam
by
adding
one
and
one
martin
but
even
so
comrade
even
though
she
stand
by
you
what
can
she
do
or
godby
and
i
for
that
matter
a
whole
ship
company
crazed
wi
panic
fear
fear
aye
and
small
wonder
martin
death
is
bad
enough
murder
worse
but
for
three
hearty
fellows
to
disappear
and
leave
no
trace
aye
but
was
there
no
trace
adam
none
shipmate
none
no
blood
anywhere
never
a
spot
shipmate
why
then
is
there
ever
a
man
aboard
with
a
wounded
hand
adam
not
one
to
my
knowing
and
i
turned
up
the
crew
on
deck
twice
these
last
two
days
every
man
and
boy
but
saw
not
so
much
as
cut
finger
or
stained
garment
among
and
i
sharp
eyes
martin
but
why
d
ask
because
the
man
who
made
away
with
these
three
fellows
was
wounded
in
the
hand
adam
howbeit
that
hand
was
bloody
hand
shipmate
says
penfeather
softly
would
it
be
a
right
hand
ha
it
was
i
nodded
the
mark
of
a
great
right
hand
aye
aye
says
adam
pinching
his
chin
a
right
hand
martin
and
where
was
the
mark
d
say
beneath
my
bed
bed
martin
your
bed
here
he
caught
his
breath
and
rose
up
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
betwixt
narrowed
lids
and
at
his
square
chin
aye
there
adam
the
only
place
in
the
ship
you
never
thought
to
search
there
he
lay
safe
hid
and
i
above
him
in
a
drugged
sleep
drugged
says
adam
betwixt
shut
teeth
aye
drugged
crass
fool
it
was
not
to
ha
guessed
it
ere
this
and
now
he
falls
silent
and
stands
very
still
only
his
sinewy
fingers
pinched
and
pinched
at
his
chin
as
he
stared
blindly
down
at
the
floor
so
now
i
told
him
of
my
fevered
dreams
and
black
imaginations
of
my
growing
fears
and
suspicions
of
the
eye
had
watched
me
through
the
and
of
the
man
on
the
river
with
the
boat
wherein
was
the
great
bundle
which
had
vanished
just
after
the
black
ship
ran
foul
of
us
lord
says
adam
at
last
so
the
mystery
is
resolved
the
matter
lies
plain
as
a
pikestaff
ha
martin
we
shipped
the
devil
aboard
it
seems
who
weareth
a
steel
hook
adam
and
yet
martin
and
yet
says
he
looking
at
me
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
herein
if
we
seek
far
enough
we
may
find
the
hand
of
providence
i
think
how
says
i
providence
d
call
it
aye
martin
if
we
do
but
seek
far
enough
here
he
turned
in
answer
to
a
furtive
rapping
and
opening
the
door
i
heard
godby
voice
come
in
man
come
in
says
adam
here
only
martin
aye
quoth
i
heartily
come
in
jenkins
that
was
my
friend
at
this
in
he
comes
unwillingly
enough
and
with
never
so
much
as
a
glance
in
my
direction
here
the
wittles
says
he
and
setting
down
the
food
and
drink
he
had
brought
turned
away
what
godby
ha
ye
no
word
for
a
poor
murderer
in
his
abasement
says
whereat
he
shakes
his
head
mighty
gloomy
and
keeping
his
gaze
averted
as
for
adam
he
stood
pinching
his
chin
the
while
his
quick
bright
eyes
darted
from
one
to
other
of
us
how
are
ye
going
and
never
a
word
quoth
i
as
godby
crossed
to
the
door
aye
i
am
says
he
with
gaze
still
averted
why
you
left
me
in
mighty
hurry
last
time
godby
aye
i
did
says
he
why
then
tell
us
wherefore
speak
out
man
not
i
martin
not
i
says
he
and
touching
his
bonnet
to
penfeather
hasted
away
ha
says
adam
closing
and
locking
the
door
and
what
the
riddle
martin
my
doublet
godby
chancing
to
take
it
up
finds
it
all
with
blood
and
incontinent
suspects
me
for
this
black
murderer
which
comes
hard
since
here
an
end
of
godby
faith
and
my
friendship
why
look
now
martin
his
suspicions
are
in
reason
seeing
that
what
with
drugs
deviltries
and
what
not
you
been
mighty
strange
o
late
and
more
unlovely
company
than
usual
d
see
howbeit
says
i
scowling
and
reaching
for
the
food
here
an
end
to
my
friendship
for
godby
now
as
to
you
what
say
i
think
shipmate
that
your
doublet
bloody
and
you
the
grimly
desperate
gallowsy
rogue
you
strive
so
hard
to
appear
martin
i
say
here
enough
to
hang
you
ten
times
over
one
thing
is
sure
you
must
leave
this
ship
not
i
adam
the
astern
victualled
and
ready
no
matter
says
i
be
no
hard
matter
to
get
you
safe
away
martin
howbeit
i
stay
here
says
i
mighty
determined
i
no
murderer
but
you
a
man
to
hang
and
hanged
you
be
and
you
can
lay
to
that
d
see
so
be
it
says
i
very
fine
shipmate
but
as
i
was
saying
the
is
towing
astern
a
good
boat
and
well
stored
the
moon
will
be
down
in
an
hour
and
what
of
it
i
demanded
be
easy
for
you
to
slip
down
from
the
stern
gallery
never

and
all
at
once
adam
started
up
as
again
there
came
a
soft
knocking
at
the
door
who
there
he
cried
and
then
in
my
ear
is
she
martin
as
i
guess
though
sooner
than
i
had
expected
into
the
bilboes
with
you
thus
whispering
and
with
action
incredibly
quick
he
clapped
and
locked
me
back
in
my
shackles
whisked
food
platter
and
bottle
into
a
dark
corner
and
crossed
to
the
door
there
he
demanded
gruffly
ensued
a
murmur
whereupon
he
turned
the
key
set
wide
the
door
and
fell
back
bowing
bonnet
in
hand
all
in
a
moment
good
master
adam
says
she
gently
pray
you
leave
us
awhile
and
let
none
intrude
on
us
at
this
adam
bows
again
very
low
with
a
whimsical
glance
at
me
and
goes
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
chapter
xix
concerning
the
princess
damaris
for
a
while
she
stood
looking
down
on
me
and
i
meeting
that
look
glanced
otherwhere
yet
conscious
of
her
regard
stirred
uneasily
so
that
my
irons
rattled
dismally
sir
says
she
at
last
but
there
i
stayed
her
madam
once
and
for
all
i
am
no
martin
conisby
she
amended
in
the
same
gentle
voice
master
penfeather
telleth
you
refused
the
honourable
service
i
offered
i
pray
you
wherefore
because
i
no
mind
to
serve
a
brandon
yet
you
steal
aboard
my
ship
master
conisby
you
eat
the
food
my
money
hath
paid
for
doth
this
suffice
your
foolish
stubborn
pride
here
finding
nought
to
say
i
scowled
at
my
fetters
and
held
my
peace
whereat
she
sighed
a
little
as
i
had
been
some
fretful
peevish
child
why
are
you
here
in
my
ship
she
questioned
patiently
was
it
for
vengeance
tell
me
she
demanded
is
it
that
you
came
yet
seeking
your
wicked
vengeance
mine
is
a
just
vengeance
vengeance
howsoever
just
is
god
leave
it
unto
god
at
this
i
was
silent
again
whereupon
she
continued
her
voice
more
soft
and
pleading
even
though
my
father
had
indeed
wronged
you
and
yours
how
shall
his
death
profit
you
ha
i
cried
staring
up
at
her
troubled
face
can
it
be
you
know
this
for
very
truth
at
last
are
you
satisfied
of
my
wrongs
and
know
my
vengeance
just
have
ye
proof
of
sir
richard
black
treachery
confess
now
at
this
her
eyes
quailed
before
my
look
and
she
shrank
away
god
forgive
him
she
whispered
bowing
stately
head
speak
says
i
fiercely
have
ye
the
truth
of
it
at
last
is
that
bringeth
me
here
to
you
martin
conisby
to
confess
this
wrong
on
his
behalf
and
on
his
behalf
to
offer
such
reparation
as
i
may
alas
for
the
bodily
sufferings
you
did
endure
we
can
never
atone
but
in
all
other
ways
never
says
i
scowling
what
is
done
is
done
and
i
am
what
i
am
but
for
yourself
his
sin
toucheth
you
no
whit
how
cried
she
passionately
am
i
not
his
flesh
his
blood
was
but
lately
i
learned
the
truth
from
his
secret
papers
and
o
all
there
even
the
price
he
paid
to
have
you
carried
to
the
plantations
so
am
i
come
pleading
your
forgiveness
for
him
and
for
me
to
humble
myself
before
you
see
thus
thus
upon
my
knees
now
beholding
all
the
warm
beauty
of
her
as
she
knelt
humbly
before
me
the
surge
and
tumult
of
her
bosom
the
quiver
of
her
red
lips
the
tearful
light
of
her
eyes
i
was
moved
beyond
speech
and
ever
she
knelt
there
bowed
and
shaken
in
her
mute
abasement
my
lady
joan
said
i
at
last
for
your
pure
self
i
can
have
nought
to
forgive
i
that
am
all
unworthy
to
touch
the
latchet
of
your
shoe
rise
i
pray
and
for
my
father
she
whispered
alas
my
poor
miserable
father
speak
not
of
him
i
cried
needs
must
there
be
hate
and
enmity
betwixt
us
until
the
end
so
was
silence
awhile
nor
did
i
look
up
dreading
to
see
her
grief
your
face
is
cut
martin
said
she
at
last
very
softly
suffer
that
i
bathe
it
now
turning
in
amaze
i
saw
her
yet
upon
her
knees
looking
up
at
me
despite
her
falling
tears
wilt
suffer
me
to
bathe
it
martin
says
she
her
voice
unshaken
by
any
sob
i
shook
my
head
but
rising
she
crossed
to
the
door
and
came
back
bearing
a
small
pannikin
of
water
i
brought
this
for
the
purpose
says
she
nay
indeed
i
i
am
well
enough
then
i
will
make
you
better
no
says
i
angrily
yes
says
she
patiently
but
setting
dimpled
chin
at
me
and
wherefore
madam
because
i
so
minded
sir
so
saying
she
knelt
close
beside
me
and
fell
my
bruised
face
as
she
would
and
i
helpless
to
stay
her
yet
marvelling
within
me
at
the
gentle
touch
of
her
soft
hands
and
the
tender
pity
in
her
eyes
martin
says
she
as
i
do
thus
cherish
your
hurts
you
shall
one
day
mayhap
cherish
your
enemy
never
says
i
you
can
know
me
not
at
all
to
think
so
i
know
you
better
than
you
guess
martin
you
think
it
strange
belike
and
unmaidenly
in
me
that
i
should
seek
you
thus
that
your
name
should
come
so
readily
to
my
lip
but
i
have
remembered
the
name
for
the
sake
of
a
boy
long
years
since
who
found
a
little
maid
she
was
just
ten
year
old
found
her
lost
and
wandering
in
a
wood
very
woeful
and
frightened
and
forlorn
and
this
boy
seemed
very
big
and
strong
he
was
just
eleven
he
said
and
was
armed
with
a
bow
and
arrows
shoot
outlaws
and
yet
he
was
very
gentle
and
kindly
laying
by
his
weapons
the
better
to
comfort
her
sorrows
and
dry
her
tears
so
he
brought
her
to
a
cave
he
called
his
and
showed
her
a
real
sword
he
kept
hidden
there
albeit
a
very
rusty
one
and
said
he
would
be
her
knight
to
do
great
things
for
her
some
day
then
he
brought
her
safely
home
and
he
told
her
his
name
was
martin
and
she
said
hers
was
damaris
damaris
said
i
starting
often
after
this
they
used
to
meet
by
a
corner
of
the
old
park
wall
where
he
had
made
a
place
to
go
up
and
down
by
for
six
months
i
think
they
played
together
daily
and
once
he
fought
a
great
rough
boy
on
her
behalf
and
when
the
boy
had
run
away
she
bathed
her
champion
hurts
in
a
little
brook
bathed
them
with
her
scarf
as
thus
i
do
yours
at
last
she
was
sent
away
to
a
school
and
the
years
passed
but
she
never
forgot
the
name
of
martin
though
he
forgot
her
quite
but
you
you
remember
now
martin
o
you
remember
now
says
she
with
a
great
sob
aye
i
remember
now
quoth
i
hoarsely
it
is
for
the
sake
of
this
boy
martin
so
brave
so
strong
yet
so
very
gentle
and
kindly
for
him
and
all
he
might
have
been
that
i
pray
you
forego
your
vengeance
i
beseech
you
to
here
renounce
it
never
i
cried
clenching
my
shackled
hands
but
for
my
enemy
this
boy
might
now
be
as
other
men
of
outcast
rogue
and
scarred
he
might
have
come
to
love
and
win
love
to
have
known
the
joy
of
life
and
its
fulness
howbeit
he
must
go
his
way
rogue
and
outcast
to
the
end
no
she
cried
no
the
wrong
may
be
undone
must
shall
be
wounds
will
heal
and
even
scars
will
fade
with
time
scars
of
the
body
aye
belike
said
i
but
there
be
scars
of
the
mind
wounds
of
the
soul
shall
never
heal
so
shall
my
just
vengeance
sleep
not
nor
die
whiles
i
have
life
here
for
awhile
she
was
silent
again
and
i
saw
a
tear
fall
sparkling
and
yet
said
she
at
last
and
never
stirring
from
her
humble
posture
and
yet
i
have
faith
in
you
still
for
despite
all
your
cruel
wrongs
and
grievous
suffering
you
are
so
young
headstrong
and
wilful
and
very
desolate
and
forlorn
thus
whiles
i
have
life
my
faith
in
you
shall
sleep
not
nor
die
yet
greatly
do
i
pity
pity
says
i
fiercely
you
were
wiser
to
hate
and
see
me
hanged
out
of
hand
poor
soul
she
sighed
and
rising
laid
one
white
hand
upon
my
shackled
fist
and
yet
mayhap
you
shall
one
day
find
again
your
sweet
and
youth
meanwhile
strive
to
be
worthy
a
sorrowing
honest
pity
pity
says
i
again
is
akin
to
love
so
give
me
hate
is
thing
most
natural
your
blood
and
mine
poor
soul
she
repeated
viewing
me
with
her
great
calm
eyes
albeit
their
lashes
were
wet
with
tears
how
may
i
hate
one
so
wretched
here
seeing
mayhap
how
the
words
stung
me
she
must
needs
repeat
them
poor
wretched
soul
far
far
beneath
my
hate
belike
you
come
to
learn
in
time
says
i
beside
myself
at
this
i
saw
the
white
hand
clench
itself
but
her
voice
was
tender
as
ever
when
she
answered
sorrow
and
suffering
may
lift
a
man
to
greatness
if
he
be
strong
of
soul
or
debase
him
to
the
brute
if
he
be
weak
why
then
says
i
begone
to
your
gallants
and
leave
me
to
the
brutes
nay
first
will
i
do
that
which
brought
me
and
she
showed
the
key
of
my
gyves
let
be
i
cried
i
seek
no
freedom
at
your
hands
let
be
i
say
as
you
will
says
she
gently
so
endeth
my
hope
of
righting
a
great
wrong
i
have
humbled
myself
to
you
martin
conisby
i
have
begged
and
prayed
you
to
forego
your
vengeance
to
forgive
the
evil
done
not
so
much
for
my
father
sake
as
for
your
own
and
this
because
of
the
boy
i
dreamed
a
man
ennobled
by
his
sufferings
and
one
great
enough
to
forgive
past
wrongs
since
by
forgiveness
cometh
regeneration
here
ends
my
dream
alas
you
are
but
rogue
and
after
all
so
shall
i
ever
pity
you
greatly
and
greatly
despise
you
then
she
turned
slowly
away
and
went
from
me
closing
and
locking
the
door
and
left
me
once
more
in
the
black
dark
but
now
full
of
yet
blacker
thoughts
to
be
scorned
by
her
and
she
a
brandon
and
now
i
miserable
wretch
that
i
was
giving
no
thought
to
the
possibility
of
my
so
speedy
dissolution
raged
in
my
bonds
wasting
myself
in
futile
imprecations
against
this
woman
who
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
blind
and
brutish
anger
had
but
come
to
triumph
over
me
in
my
abasement
thus
of
my
wounded
did
i
make
me
a
whip
of
scorpions
whereby
i
knew
an
agony
beyond
expression
chapter
xx
how
i
came
out
of
my
bonds
and
of
the
terrors
of
a
fire
at
sea
the
devil
ever
zealous
for
the
undoing
of
poor
humanity
surely
findeth
no
readier
ally
than
the
blind
and
merciless
spirit
of
mortified
pride
thus
i
minding
the
lady
joan
scornful
look
and
the
sting
of
her
words
fell
to
black
and
raging
fury
and
vowed
that
since
rogue
and
she
had
named
me
rogue
she
should
find
me
in
very
truth
henceforward
if
i
might
but
escape
my
perilous
situation
and
now
it
was
that
chance
or
fate
or
the
devil
sent
me
a
means
whereby
i
might
put
this
desperate
and
most
unworthy
resolution
into
practice
for
scarce
had
i
uttered
this
vow
when
a
key
turned
softly
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
and
closed
stealthily
and
though
i
could
not
see
it
being
i
knew
that
someone
stood
within
a
yard
of
me
and
all
with
scarce
a
sound
and
never
a
word
and
when
this
silence
had
endured
a
while
i
spoke
sudden
and
harsh
what
now
is
it
the
noose
so
soon
or
a
knife
sooner
i
heard
a
breath
a
soft
footfall
and
a
small
hand
groping
in
the
dark
touched
my
cheek
and
crept
thence
to
my
helpless
manacled
fist
who
is
it
i
demanded
blenching
from
the
touch
who
is
it
speak
hush
whispered
a
voice
in
my
ear
it
be
only
me
master
jimmy
little
jim
as
you
was
good
to
red
andy
do
beat
me
no
more
he
be
afeared
o
you
good
to
me
you
was
master
an
so
she
took
me
to
be
her
page
she
whom
mean
boy
i
mean
her
her
wi
the
beautiful
kind
eyes
an
little
feet

as
sings
her
they
calls
lady
her
good
t
me
she
is
an
you
so
i
be
come
to
ye
master
ha
did
she
send
you
no
i
just
come
to
save
you
from
being
hung
like
they
says
you
must
and
how
shall
you
do
this
boy
first
wi
this
key
master
stay
did
she
give
you
this
key
no
master
i
took
it
so
albeit
was
very
dark
the
boy
very
soon
had
freed
me
of
my
shackles
which
done
and
all
with
haste
he
seizes
my
hand
and
tugs
at
it
come
master
he
whispered
this
way
this
way
so
with
his
little
rough
hand
in
mine
i
suffered
him
to
bring
me
whither
he
would
in
the
dimness
for
not
a
lanthorn
burned
anywhere
until
at
last
he
halted
me
at
a
ladder
propped
against
a
bulkhead
and
mounting
before
bade
me
follow
up
i
climbed
forthwith
and
so
to
a
narrow
trap
or
scuttle
through
which
i
clambered
with
no
little
and
found
myself
in
a
strange
place
the
roof
so
low
i
could
barely
sit
upright
and
so
strait
that
i
might
barely
lie
lie
you
here
master
he
whispers
and
for
the
love
o
god
speak
nor
make
a
sound
saying
which
he
got
him
back
through
the
scuttle
closing
the
trap
after
him
and
i
heard
the
clatter
of
the
ladder
as
he
removed
it
hereupon
lying
snug
in
my
i
presently
became
aware
of
a
sweetness
that
breathed
upon
the
air
a
fragrance
very
faint
but
vastly
pleasing
and
fell
what
this
should
be
my
speculations
were
banished
by
the
opening
of
a
door
near
by
and
a
light
appeared
by
which
i
saw
myself
lying
in
a
narrow
space
shut
off
by
a
valance
or
curtain
that
yet
showed
a
strip
of
carpet
beyond
and
all
at
once
upon
this
carpet
came
a
little
buckled
shoe
i
was
yet
staring
on
this
in
dumb
amaze
when
a
voice
spoke
softly
are
you
there
martin
conisby
hush
speak
low
i
do
command
you
for
answer
i
dragged
myself
into
the
light
and
stared
up
at
the
lady
joan
brandon
where
am
i
i
demanded
in
my
cabin
says
she
meeting
my
scowl
with
eyes
serene
and
all
untroubled
i
had
you
brought
hither
to
save
you
to
save
me
ha
you
you
to
save
me
because
you
are
not
man
enough
to
die
yet
she
went
on
in
her
calm
grave
voice
so
i
will
save
you
alive
that
haply
you
may
grow
more
worthy
so
was
by
your
orders
the
boy
lied
then
says
i
choking
with
my
anger
was
you
gave
him
the
key
was
you
bade
him
bring
me
hither
where
none
shall
dare
seek
you
says
she
all
unmoved
by
my
bitter
rage
so
do
i
give
you
life
martin
conisby
praying
god
you
may
find
your
manhood
one
day
life
quoth
i
getting
to
my
feet
my
life
at
your
hands
now
look
ye
madam
rather
will
i
hang
unjustly
rather
will
i
endure
again
the
shame
of
the
lash
aye
by
god
light
rather
will
i
rot
in
chains
or
perish
of
plague
than
take
my
life
at
your
hands
so
now
madam
out
of
this
perfumed
nest
and
hang
if
i
must
saying
which
i
turned
to
the
door
but
she
checked
me
with
a
gesture
stay
she
commanded
would
you
shame
me
and
now
though
she
fronted
me
with
proud
head
erect
i
saw
her
cheek
flush
painfully
aye
verily
quoth
i
a
lady
honour
is
delicate
ware
and
not
to
be
cheapened
by
such
poor
rogue
as
i
fear
nothing
lady
i
will
go
as
i
stopped
all
at
once
as
came
footsteps
without
and
a
light
tapping
on
the
door
who
is
it
she
called
lightly
enough
and
shot
the
bolt
with
nimble
fingers
only
i
sweet
coz
answered
a
gay
voice
and
i
come
but
to
warn
you
not
to
venture
on
deck
till
justice
hath
been
done
upon
our
prisoner
shall
you
hang
him
rupert
assuredly
is
a
black
rogue
and
merits
a
worse
fate
is
he
then
tried
and
condemned
already
rupert
nay
though
be
soon
done
we
have
come
on
such
evidence
of
his
guilt
as
doth
condemn
him
out
of
hand
what
evidence
cousin
his
doublet
all
besmirched
with
his
victim
blood
the
man
is
a
very
devil
and
must
hang
at
dawn
so
joan
stir
not
abroad
in
the
morning
until
i
come
to
fetch
you
a
fair
good
night
sweet
coz
and
sweet
dreams
attend
thee
and
away
trips
sir
rupert
and
leaves
us
staring
on
one
another
she
proud
and
gracious
in
all
her
dainty
finery
and
i
a
very
fellow
my
worn
garments
smirched
by
the
grime
of
my
many
was
this
indeed
your
doublet
she
questioned
at
last
it
was
how
came
it
stained
with
blood
for
answer
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
turned
away
have
you
nothing
to
say
nothing
madam
you
would
have
me
think
you
this
murderer
i
would
have
you
think
of
me
none
at
all
i
answered
and
smiled
to
see
how
i
had
stirred
her
anger
at
last
nay
sighs
she
needs
must
i
think
of
you
as
the
poor
mean
thing
you
are
and
pity
you
accordingly
howbeit
says
i
scowling
blacker
than
ever
i
will
get
me
out
of
your
sight
aye
but
the
ladder
is
gone
no
matter
says
i
better
a
broken
neck
than
a
noose
aye
the
dawn
is
like
to
see
an
end
of
the
feud
and
the
conisbys
both
together
and
so
shameful
an
end
says
she
at
this
i
turned
my
back
on
her
for
anger
was
very
strong
in
me
so
nothing
speaking
i
got
to
my
knees
that
i
might
come
at
the
trap
beneath
her
berth
but
next
moment
i
was
on
my
feet
glaring
round
for
some
weapon
to
my
defence
for
on
the
air
was
sudden
wild
tumult
and
hubbub
a
running
of
feet
and
confused
shouting
that
waxed
ever
louder
then
as
i
listened
i
knew
it
was
not
me
they
hunted
for
now
was
the
shrill
braying
of
a
trumpet
and
the
loud
throbbing
of
a
drum
martin
o
martin
conisby
she
stood
with
hands
clasped
and
eyes
wide
in
a
dreadful
expectancy
what
is
it
she
panted
o
what
is
it
hark
what
do
they
cry
rigid
and
motionless
we
stood
to
listen
then
every
other
emotion
was
and
lost
in
sudden
paralysing
fear
as
above
the
trampling
rush
of
feet
above
the
shrill
blast
of
tucket
and
rolling
of
drum
we
caught
the
awful
word
fire
now
god
help
us
all
cries
she
wringing
her
hands
then
sinking
to
her
knees
she
leaned
against
the
door
yet
i
saw
her
pallid
lips
moving
in
passionate
supplication
as
for
me
my
first
panic
over
i
sat
me
on
her
bed
revolving
how
i
might
turn
the
general
confusion
to
the
preservation
of
my
life
in
this
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
my
lady
hand
on
my
bowed
shoulder
hark
cries
she
hark
where
they
cry
for
aid
why
so
they
do
says
i
and
so
they
may
then
come
let
us
out
you
are
a
strong
man
you
will
help
to
save
the
ship
and
hang
thereafter
not
i
madam
will
you
do
nothing
cried
she
clenching
her
hands
verily
madam
i
shall
do
my
earnest
endeavour
to
preserve
this
poor
rogue
body
o
mine
from
noose
and
flame
but
as
for
the
ship
let
it
burn
say
i
spoke
like
a
very
coward
says
she
in
bitter
scorn
and
a
coward
is
selfish
always
so
saying
she
crossed
to
the
door
and
reached
her
hand
to
the
bolt
but
in
a
leap
i
was
beside
her
and
caught
this
hand
it
there
madam
quoth
i
you
tell
me
that
to
hang
is
a
shameful
death
and
the
noose
as
good
as
round
my
neck
but
before
god
madam
i
see
this
ship
go
up
in
flame
and
perish
with
it
ere
that
noose
shall
strangle
the
life
out
of
me
and
my
wrongs
unavenged
so
the
ship
may
burn
an
it
will
meantime
do
you
seek
your
salvation
and
leave
me
to
seek
mine
then
opening
the
door
i
stood
aside
to
give
her
way
instead
she
stood
a
moment
looking
on
me
o
blind
says
she
at
last
to
treasure
life
for
your
wicked
vengeance
o
blind
blind
then
and
very
suddenly
she
sped
out
and
away
left
alone
i
stood
hearkening
to
the
distant
uproar
and
casting
about
in
my
mind
how
best
i
might
contrive
my
preservation
and
now
in
my
desperate
need
it
seemed
there
was
but
one
hope
for
me
and
this
but
slender
to
steal
myself
up
to
adam
lodgment
under
the
poop
and
that
as
soon
as
might
be
to
this
end
i
stepped
forth
of
the
cabin
and
so
into
a
narrow
with
divers
doors
to
right
and
left
that
opened
upon
other
cabins
in
one
of
which
i
espied
a
cloak
and
feathered
hat
lying
where
their
owner
had
dropped
them
whipping
the
cloak
about
me
i
clapped
on
the
hat
and
staying
for
no
more
hasted
on
breathing
an
air
acrid
with
drifting
smoke
reaching
a
broad
stairway
i
climbed
at
speed
and
found
myself
out
upon
the
lofty
poop
whence
i
might
look
down
on
the
decks
through
a
haze
of
smoke
that
poured
up
through
the
after
hatchway
mounting
in
billowy
wreaths
against
the
splendour
of
the
moon
here
it
seemed
was
gathered
the
whole
company
with
mighty
stir
and
and
none
with
eyes
to
spare
for
me
howbeit
i
stayed
for
no
second
glance
but
running
to
adam
cabin
found
the
door
unlocked
the
which
i
closed
and
bolted
after
me
in
the
doing
of
which
i
noticed
to
my
comfort
that
this
door
was
mighty
thick
and
strong
and
in
it
moreover
a
loophole
newly
cut
with
others
in
the
bulkheads
to
right
and
left
and
all
very
neatly
plugged
from
within
and
what
with
this
and
the
musquetoons
that
stood
in
racks
very
orderly
the
place
small
though
it
was
had
all
the
virtues
of
a
fort
or
citadel
here
then
so
far
as
might
be
i
was
safe
whatever
chanced
since
i
had
but
to
lift
the
trap
in
the
floor
and
descend
into
the
roundhouse
below
whence
i
might
gain
the
and
so
the
sea
itself
and
now
laying
by
the
hat
and
cloak
i
cast
myself
on
adam
bed
and
there
outstretched
in
great
content
hearkened
to
the
distant
voices
and
tramp
of
feet
where
they
laboured
to
put
out
the
fire
little
by
little
these
sounds
became
merged
with
the
droning
of
the
wind
and
the
surge
and
hiss
of
the
seas
lulled
by
this
and
the
sense
of
my
comparative
safety
i
presently
fell
and
sleeping
thus
dreamed
myself
young
again
and
playing
with
the
child
damaris
thrilling
to
the
clasp
of
her
little
childish
hands
joying
in
the
tones
of
her
clear
sweet
child
voice
she
that
grown
up
i
knew
for
none
other
than
joan
brandon
chapter
xxi
telleth
how
the
said
fire
came
about
lord
love
me
shipmate
here
you
to
hang
at
peep
o
day
and
in
your
dreams
what
adam
says
i
sitting
up
in
few
short
hours
martin
here
will
be
ninety
odd
souls
earnestly
seeking
to
swing
you
up
to
the
and
you
sweet
as
any
innocent
babe
and
burn
me
shipmate
i
love
you
the
better
what
of
the
fire
adam
why
was
an
excellent
fire
martin
and
smoked
bravely
what
more
it
served
its
divers
purposes
whiles
it
lasted
is
it
out
then
adam
this
two
hours
and
what
might
you
mean
by
its
purposes
well
mayhap
you
were
one
o
them
martin
here
the
second
time
fire
hath
served
ye
well
you
mind
how
i
cried
starting
to
my
feet
will
you
be
telling
me
was
you
set
this
fire
going
as
to
the
other
purpose
shipmate
is
yonder
hark
to
it
and
smiling
grimly
adam
held
up
a
sinewy
finger
as
from
somewhere
forward
rose
a
confused
and
dismal
wailing
in
heaven
name
what
toward
now
adam
the
crew
are
singing
martin
likewise
they
dance
presently
they
shall
fall
then
grow
all
in
regular
and
accepted
order
already
one
poor
rogue
hath
been
aft
to
demand
the
women
of
us
d
see
and
to
demand
the
women
says
i
in
gasping
astonishment
aye
the
women
martin
my
lady
joan
and
her
maid
d
see
god
love
adam
i
cried
gripping
his
arm
and
you
what
said
you
to
the
vile
dog
nought
i
shot
him
is
the
mutiny
broke
out
then
not
yet
shipmate
but
is
coming
aye
is
coming
which
is
very
well
and
what
hath
brought
things
to
this
pass
rum
martin
the
fire
was
in
the
where
there
is
rum
d
see
and
what
was
to
prevent
the
rogues
making
off
with
a
keg
or
so
that
chanced
to
lie
handy
not
i
shipmate
not
i
and
why
not
in
the
devil
name
because
martin
says
adam
sitting
at
the
table
and
beginning
to
set
his
papers
in
order
because
there
nought
like
liquor
for
putting
the
devil
into
a
man
and
of
all
liquor
commend
me
to
rum
with
a
dash
o
tobacco
or
gunpowder
d
see
we
shall
be
heaving
dead
men
overboard
ere
dawn
i
judge
and
all
along
of
this
same
rum
martin
black
mutiny
murder
and
sudden
death
shipmate
and
more
the
pity
say
i
but
if
providence
seeth
fit
why
so
be
it
providence
quoth
i
scowling
down
into
his
impassive
face
dare
ye
talk
of
providence
was
you
set
this
bloody
business
aye
martin
it
was
says
he
nodding
as
to
providence
now
if
you
can
ape
providence
to
your
own
ends
which
is
vengeance
and
bloody
murder
i
can
do
as
much
for
mine
which
is
to
save
the
lives
of
such
as
stand
true
to
me
and
the
ship
not
to
mention
the
women
there
tressady
skulking
below
and
i
have
but
contrived
that
the
mutiny
should
come
in
my
time
rather
than
his
and
theirs
as
it
is
we
are
prepared
fifteen
stout
lads
lie
in
the
below
with
musquetoon
and
fusee
and
every
gun
and
swivel
that
will
bear
falconet
and
paterero
aimed
to
sweep
the
waist
when
they
rush
as
rush
they
will
martin
when
the
drink
hath
maddened
properly
and
having
maddened
them
with
your
hellish
decoctions
you
shoot
the
poor
rogues
down
aye
martin
i
will
so
lest
peradventure
they
shoot
me
then
besides
shipmate
what
o
the
women
i
have
the
lady
joan
and
her
maid
to
think
on
be
an
ill
fate
theirs
in
the
hands
of
yon
filthy
rabblement
hark
to
yonder
hark
what
they
sing
for
a
while
i
could
hear
nought
but
a
clamour
of
fierce
shouts
and
hallooing
then
little
by
little
this
wild
hoarse
tumult
rose
and
swelled
to
a
fierce
chaunt
some
swam
in
rum
to
kingdom
come
full
many
a
lusty
fellow
and
since
they
sped
all
stark
and
dead
they
flaming
now
in
hell
o
so
cheerly
o
hey
cheerly
o
they
burning
down
in
hell
o
d
hear
it
martin
did
ye
hear
it
shoot
the
poor
rogues
d
say
sink
me
but
i
will
so
if
fortune
be
so
kind
yonder
short
shrift
and
quick
dispatch
for
me
shipmate
and
then
the
women
think
of
my
lady
joan
writhing
in
their
clutches
to
the
lewd
rogues
is
women
now
hark
to
and
here
again
their
vile
song
burst
forth
with
much
the
same
obscenity
as
i
had
once
heard
sung
by
abnegation
mings
in
a
wood
and
the
which
i
will
not
here
transcribe
well
shipmate
says
adam
glancing
up
from
his
papers
last
of
all
there
yourself
here
you
with
the
rope
in
prospect
unless
you
quit
this
ship
and
yonder
martin
yonder
is
the
towing
astern
all
stored
ready
a
calm
sea
and
a
fair
wind
no
more
of
that
says
i
angrily
but
will
ye
dangle
in
a
noose
martin
when
you
might
be
away
in
the
as
tows
astern
of
us
and
with
a
fair
wind
as
i
say
and
have
done
says
i
clenching
my
fists
be
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
martin
he
went
on
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
nodding
up
at
me
mighty
pleasant
aye
a
very
simple
matter
for
you
to
drop
down
from
the
yonder
d
see
and
setting
a
course
you
should
make
our
island
in
hours
or
less
what
with
this
wind
and
the
sea
so
calm
never
cried
i
in
growing
fury
come
what
will
i
stay
aboard
this
ship
until
we
reach
our
destination
hum
says
he
pinching
his
chin
and
eyeing
me
narrowed
lids
are
ye
still
bent
on
nought
but
vengeance
then
why
martin
none
so
far
to
seek
for
seeing
you
may
not
reach
the
father
why
not
smite
him
through
the
daughter
she
make
fine
sport
for
our
beastly
crew
hark
to
roaring
sport
for
them
and
a
mighty
full
vengeance
for
you
the
table
betwixt
us
hampered
my
blow
and
then
as
i
strove
to
come
at
him
i
brought
up
with
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
within
a
foot
of
my
brow
easy
shipmate
easy
says
he
leaning
back
in
his
chair
but
keeping
me
covered
damned
rogue
i
panted
true
he
nodded
true
martin
vengeance
is
kin
to
roguery
d
see
if
you
for
murdering
the
father
what
to
hinder
you
from
giving
the
proud
daughter
up
to
steady
martin
steady
it
is
your
sudden
ways
be
apt
to
startle
a
timid
man
and
my
finger
on
the
trigger
now
shipmate
if
your
scheme
of
vengeance
doth
not
permit
of
such
methods
towards
a
woman
what
to
prevent
you
going
on
another
track
and
carrying
her
with
you
safe
from
all
chance
of
brutality
there
stowage
for
her
in
the
which
is
a
stout
roomy
craft
now
towing
astern
stored
and
victualled
a
smooth
sea
a
fair
wind
adam
penfeather
says
i
choking
with
passion
once
and
for
all
i
bide
on
this
ship
until
she
brings
up
off
hispaniola
but
then
martin
she
never
will
bring
up
off
hispaniola
not
whiles
i
navigate
her
ha
i
cried
doth
my
lady
know
of
this
doth
sir
rupert
not
yet
martin
then
by
heaven
they
shall
learn
this
very
hour
i
think
not
martin
and
i
swear
they
shall
let
them
hang
me
an
they
will
but
first
they
shall
hear
you
intend
to
seize
the
ship
to
your
own
purposes
aye
by
god
they
shall
know
you
for
the
pirate
you
are
now
as
i
turned
and
strode
for
the
door
i
heard
the
sudden
scrape
of
adam
chair
behind
me
and
whirling
about
saw
his
pistol
above
my
head
felt
the
vicious
staggering
blow
and
reeling
to
the
door
sank
weakly
to
my
knees
and
thence
seemed
to
plunge
into
a
black
immensity
and
knew
no
more
chapter
xxii
telleth
how
we
were
cast
adrift
i
awoke
to
a
wind
on
my
brow
very
pleasant
and
sweet
and
in
my
ears
the
soft
and
drowsy
ripple
of
water
right
soothing
to
hear
and
thus
would
have
slumbered
on
but
for
another
sound
that
broke
out
at
intervals
a
thunderous
roar
that
seemed
to
shake
me
where
i
lay
therefore
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
above
me
a
great
multitude
of
stars
and
lay
staring
up
at
them
in
vague
and
dreamy
wonderment
until
roused
again
by
another
thunderclap
i
raised
myself
and
saw
i
lay
in
the
of
a
large
open
boat
that
rocked
to
a
gentle
swell
and
all
about
me
a
misty
sea
grey
with
the
dawn
now
as
i
gazed
around
me
greatly
troubled
and
amazed
i
beheld
far
away
across
these
dim
waters
a
flash
of
red
flame
and
after
some
while
heard
again
the
thunder
of
a
gun
little
by
little
as
the
light
waxed
i
made
out
the
loom
of
two
ships
and
despite
the
distance
i
knew
the
foremost
for
the
faithful
friend
ever
and
anon
would
come
the
faint
crack
of
caliver
or
petronel
from
her
high
poop
and
the
thunder
of
her
guns
and
with
my
mind
eyes
i
seemed
to
espy
adam
firing
from
his
loopholes
to
sweep
the
decks
forward
the
while
godby
and
his
few
gunners
served
the
great
basilisks
aft
aiming
them
at
a
tall
black
ship
that
stood
hard
in
their
wake
yawing
now
and
then
to
bring
her
to
bear
on
them
in
answer
suddenly
up
flamed
the
sun
turning
sea
and
sky
to
glory
but
i
crouched
miserable
in
my
helplessness
for
now
i
saw
the
faithful
friend
steered
a
course
that
was
taking
her
rapidly
away
from
me
upon
the
freshening
wind
perceiving
which
bitter
truth
beholding
myself
thus
befooled
bubbled
and
tricked
and
my
head
throbbing
from
the
blow
of
penfeather
a
mighty
anger
against
him
surged
within
me
and
shaking
my
fists
i
fell
to
fierce
curses
and
revilings
like
any
madman
until
what
with
my
aching
head
and
lack
of
breath
i
cast
myself
face
down
and
lay
there
spent
with
my
futile
ravings
yet
even
so
bethinking
me
of
all
my
fine
schemes
and
purposes
thus
brought
to
nothingness
and
myself
drifting
impotent
at
the
mercy
of
wind
and
wave
i
sought
to
spit
my
puny
anger
against
the
god
that
made
me
in
blasphemies
and
bitter
imprecations
o
shame
shame
on
you
martin
conisby
the
god
you
rail
upon
is
my
god
also
have
done
i
say
be
silent
nor
tempt
his
mercy
with
your
childish
clamours
i
turned
and
beheld
the
lady
brandon
upon
her
knees
within
a
yard
of
me
saw
her
shrink
before
my
gaze
and
the
griping
passion
of
my
hands
for
now
reading
in
her
look
all
her
scorn
and
loathing
for
the
thing
i
was
i
must
needs
turn
my
fury
upon
her
and
did
that
the
which
shames
me
to
this
day
for
even
as
she
fronted
me
all
defenceless
but
with
head
erect
and
eyes
unflinching
despite
the
sick
pallor
of
her
cheeks
i
seized
her
in
cruel
hold
and
dragging
her
to
me
bent
her
backward
across
a
thwart
ha
i
gasped
will
ye
dare
cry
shame
on
me
will
ye
mock
will
ye
flout
will
ye
scorn
me
still
and
you
but
a
lying
thieving
brandon
would
you
trample
me
your
proud
feet
all
this
says
she
staring
up
into
my
eyes
but
i
do
pity
you
most
for
what
you
are
become
o
kill
me
if
you
will
be
very
easy
for
you
and
mayhap
best
for
me
and
i
do
not
fear
to
die
so
do
as
you
will
martin
conisby
i
do
not
fear
you
since
death
is
my
kind
friend
and
shall
free
me
of
the
shame
of
you
if
need
be
hereupon
i
loosed
her
and
crouched
again
in
the
bowed
my
head
upon
my
fists
whiles
she
kneeling
patiently
beside
the
midship
thwart
ordered
her
wrenched
garments
with
shaking
hands
and
after
some
while
her
voice
with
its
sweet
vital
ring
pierced
to
those
black
deeps
where
lay
the
soul
of
me
is
growing
very
rough
what
must
we
do
lifting
my
head
i
saw
that
the
sea
was
risen
considerably
and
the
boat
drifting
broadside
to
the
wind
so
that
the
waves
taking
us
abeam
spilled
aboard
us
ever
and
anon
so
i
arose
and
made
shift
to
step
the
mast
and
hoist
sail
nothing
heeding
her
proffered
aid
then
shipping
the
tiller
i
put
our
little
vessel
before
the
wind
and
now
from
a
log
pitching
and
rolling
at
mercy
of
the
waves
this
boat
became
as
it
were
alive
and
purposeful
lifting
to
the
seas
with
joyous
motion
shaking
the
water
from
her
bows
in
flashing
brine
that
sparkled
in
the
early
sun
her
every
timber
thrilling
to
the
buffets
of
the
waters
that
rushed
bubbling
astern
all
and
with
a
sound
like
elfin
laughter
until
what
with
all
this
and
the
strong
sweet
air
even
i
felt
the
joy
of
it
but
though
my
black
humour
lifted
somewhat
my
shame
was
sore
upon
me
wherefore
i
kept
my
gaze
for
the
peak
of
the
sail
the
cloudless
heaven
the
deep
blue
of
the
seas
and
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
the
patient
solitary
figure
amidships
whither
do
we
sail
she
questioned
at
last
what
matter
says
i
sullenly
aye
true
she
sighed
besides
i
have
no
compass
there
is
one
in
the
locker
here
and
with
it
a
packet
and
a
letter
writ
to
you
shall
i
bring
them
as
you
will
says
i
keeping
my
gaze
averted
so
she
makes
her
way
over
to
me
and
mighty
dexterous
despite
the
motion
of
the
boat
and
setting
the
compass
beside
me
gives
me
the
letter
it
was
sealed
and
subscribed
thus
to
my
trusty
friend
comrade
and
martin
these
breaking
the
seal
i
read
as
follows
for
your
sore
head
martin
i
grieve
but
the
blow
i
regret
no
whit
seeing
it
was
struck
to
our
mutual
advantage
hereafter
now
you
reading
this
being
at
sea
betwixt
the
parallels
and
in
an
open
boat
and
all
by
reason
of
circumstances
proving
too
strong
for
you
martin
it
much
behoveth
you
to
mark
and
heed
well
these
my
directions
to
wit
you
shall
lay
your
course
and
that
for
these
several
and
sufficing
reasons
you
lie
out
of
the
track
of
ships
these
be
treacherous
seas
given
to
sudden
furies
of
wind
and
raging
tempest
i
like
not
the
look
of
the
weather
our
island
lieth
scarce
hours
sail
due
whereof
i
have
drawn
for
your
guidance
a
chart
of
these
waters
together
with
a
plan
of
our
island
very
just
and
exact
also
a
chart
of
the
passage
or
channel
through
the
for
saving
this
passage
there
is
no
landing
upon
the
island
that
i
know
of
nor
shall
you
attempt
this
passage
except
at
the
flood
and
the
seas
calm
being
landed
martin
you
shall
with
due
regard
to
rest
and
refreshment
forthwith
secure
our
treasure
the
secret
whereof
i
have
included
with
this
my
letter
thereupon
and
with
all
dispatch
you
shall
troubling
not
for
the
gold
or
silver
take
but
the
four
caskets
of
jewels
and
setting
them
aboard
your
boat
sail
away
due
west
three
days
until
you
shall
fetch
up
with
another
island
the
which
you
shall
know
by
its
three
several
hills
plain
to
be
seen
and
called
gibbet
island
since
was
there
i
hanged
one
juan
maldonada
and
richly
deserved
it
here
then
you
shall
bury
our
treasure
four
caskets
in
such
place
as
seemeth
to
you
proper
and
there
await
my
coming
and
if
i
join
you
not
within
two
months
then
shall
this
mighty
treasure
thereof
be
yours
and
if
i
come
not
within
six
months
then
shall
this
fortune
be
wholly
yours
since
i
shall
be
beyond
all
need
of
it
so
now
martin
good
fortune
attend
you
your
boat
chosen
by
me
long
since
and
for
this
very
purpose
is
staunch
and
an
excellent
and
very
well
stored
with
everything
for
your
needs
as
arms
clothes
food
and
the
like
moreover
within
the
is
all
manner
of
stores
so
that
a
man
even
though
he
bides
on
the
land
to
his
life
end
need
suffer
no
lack
but
have
his
every
comfort
supplied
and
now
as
to
your
head
martin
be
none
the
worse
by
this
i
judge
and
for
the
blow
was
no
harder
than
called
for
and
very
well
intentioned
as
you
shall
confess
one
day
mayhap
unless
you
be
greater
fool
and
blinder
than
i
take
you
for
howbeit
i
trust
you
martin
and
in
bidding
you
farewell
for
the
nonce
subscribe
myself
your
faithful
friend
and
comrade
to
serve
adam
penfeather
having
read
this
wordy
missive
i
crumpled
it
in
angry
fist
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
but
now
she
gives
me
the
packet
named
therein
the
which
i
forthwith
tossed
overboard
like
the
wilful
fool
i
was
thereby
involving
us
in
divers
and
many
great
dangers
and
difficulties
as
you
shall
learn
hereafter
howbeit
the
wind
serving
i
altered
our
course
and
stood
away
even
as
adam
had
directed
since
i
perceived
the
weather
thickening
behind
us
and
the
sea
heaving
with
uneasy
motion
and
presently
my
companion
questions
me
again
whither
do
we
sail
aye
but
whither
to
an
island
is
it
far
two
days
journey
or
thereabouts
do
you
know
this
island
i
have
never
seen
it
then
why
sail
thither
is
thereabouts
penfeather
would
meet
with
us
again
if
he
may
and
being
there
what
then
god
knoweth
here
was
silence
again
save
for
the
creak
of
mast
and
timbers
as
we
rose
to
the
gentle
swell
and
the
ripple
of
water
our
keel
while
the
sun
high
risen
blazed
down
from
the
blue
his
fierce
beams
tempered
by
the
cool
sweet
wind
are
you
hungry
martin
is
there
aught
to
eat
plenty
so
saying
she
opened
one
of
the
lockers
and
brought
thence
a
loaf
of
fine
white
bread
a
neat
tongue
a
flask
of
wine
and
a
small
barrico
of
water
upon
which
i
for
one
made
an
excellent
meal
which
done
she
sets
all
things
away
again
very
orderly
and
sits
elbow
on
knee
staring
away
into
the
distance
and
with
her
back
to
me
hereupon
i
opened
the
and
found
therein
a
couple
of
musquetoons
a
brace
of
pistols
a
sword
with
belt
and
hangers
and
divers
kegs
of
powder
and
ball
how
came
you
lying
stunned
in
the
boat
says
my
companion
at
last
but
without
turning
her
head
by
roguery
i
answered
but
how
and
when
did
the
mutiny
start
was
when
we
went
to
fetch
the
boy
my
little
page
marjorie
and
i
he
lay
hurt
and
crying
on
the
deck
so
we
ran
out
to
him
and
took
him
up
betwixt
us
and
then
i
heard
shouts
and
rush
of
feet
and
they
were
all
about
us
drunken
men
singing
and
dancing
and
they
struggled
with
us
till
came
master
penfeather
with
godby
and
others
and
after
much
bitter
fighting
brought
us
away
but
marjorie
my
dear
faithful
marjorie
had
taken
a
blow
aimed
at
me
and
died
in
my
arms
and
the
great
cabin
choking
with
and
wounded
men
who
cried
and
shouted
my
dear
brave
marjorie
with
the
dark
the
fight
began
again
and
twice
i
feared
they
would
break
in
upon
us
then
master
adam
brought
me
into
the
and
lowered
me
into
the
boat
where
i
might
lie
secure
and
so
got
him
back
into
the
battle
but
in
a
little
i
saw
a
hand
in
the
gloom
cutting
at
the
and
i
screamed
but
none
heard
and
so
the
boat
drifted
away
and
with
the
dawn
i
found
you
lying
under
a
when
she
had
done
i
sat
awhile
staring
up
at
the
peak
of
the
sail
my
lady
brandon
says
i
at
length
fate
hath
set
you
in
scurvy
company
for
i
am
an
ill
rogue
very
rough
and
and
no
fit
company
for
any
woman
as
you
do
very
well
know
howbeit
i
swear
that
henceforth
so
long
as
we
company
together
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
than
i
may
either
by
act
or
speech
you
to
your
place
in
the
bows
yonder
in
mine
here
at
the
tiller
you
to
your
thoughts
i
to
mine
and
thus
methinks
we
shall
do
well
enough
until
we
can
go
our
several
ways
must
we
not
speak
she
questioned
keeping
her
face
turned
from
me
when
needful
madam
am
i
but
to
answer
when
you
deign
me
notice
will
it
plague
you
if
i
sing
am
i
to
sit
with
my
hands
folded
henceforth
and
do
nought
but
think
must
i
stay
in
the
bows
until
you
summon
me
thence
says
she
and
all
in
the
same
small
soft
voice
so
that
i
perceived
my
fine
speech
had
been
thrown
away
wherefore
i
stared
up
at
the
sail
and
with
never
a
word
in
answer
but
presently
chancing
to
look
at
her
i
found
her
regarding
me
with
her
dimpled
chin
set
mighty
resolute
because
says
she
meeting
my
look
i
shall
talk
when
i
will
and
sing
when
so
minded
martin
conisby
i
shall
not
sit
in
the
bows
for
is
wet
there
and
i
shall
not
fold
my
hands
but
you
shall
teach
me
how
to
steer
and
handle
the
boat
and
do
my
share
of
the
labour
for
look
now
here
are
we
by
no
will
of
our
own
god
knoweth
companions
in
misfortune
let
us
then
aid
each
other
that
our
troubles
be
the
easier
and
o
pray
do
you
forget
martin
conisby
his
woes
awhile
and
away
she
goes
and
getting
to
her
knees
before
one
of
the
lockers
begins
rearranging
the
contents
singing
away
the
while
merry
as
any
grig
as
the
day
wore
on
the
skies
clouded
over
with
a
wind
very
sudden
and
blusterous
wherefore
misliking
the
look
of
things
i
was
for
shortening
sail
but
feared
to
leave
the
helm
lest
the
boat
should
broach
to
and
swamp
while
this
was
but
the
wind
increasing
i
was
necessitated
to
call
my
companion
beside
me
and
teach
her
how
she
must
counter
each
with
the
helm
and
found
her
very
apt
and
quick
to
learn
so
leaving
the
boat
to
her
manage
i
got
me
forward
and
with
no
little
our
sail
leaving
just
sufficient
to
steer
by
which
done
i
glanced
to
my
companion
where
she
leaned
to
the
tiller
her
long
hair
streaming
out
upon
the
wind
her
lithe
body
to
the
pitching
of
the
boat
and
steering
as
well
as
i
myself
from
her
i
gazed
to
windward
where
an
ominous
and
blackness
filled
me
with
no
small
apprehensions
wherefore
i
made
fast
all
our
loose
gear
as
oars
spare
sail
spars
and
the
like
now
in
the
bows
were
stowed
her
belongings
a
leathern
trunk
and
divers
bundles
the
which
i
proceeded
to
secure
in
their
turn
this
done
i
got
me
aft
again
but
when
i
would
have
relieved
her
of
the
tiller
she
shook
her
head
nay
let
me
steer
a
while
she
cried
looking
up
through
her
hair
is
joy
to
me
lay
you
down
and
rest
a
while
and
trust
the
boat
to
me
and
seeing
how
quick
she
was
to
meet
each
send
of
the
seas
that
were
already
running
high
glad
enough
was
i
to
humour
her
whim
and
clambered
forward
again
and
there
having
nought
better
to
do
i
set
about
rigging
a
rough
awning
athwart
the
bows
with
canvas
and
a
stout
spar
which
methought
should
keep
out
the
spray
and
any
chance
sea
that
might
break
forward
though
indeed
the
boat
seemed
mighty
staunch
and
to
a
miracle
with
every
hour
the
wind
waxed
in
fury
and
therewith
the
sea
rose
huge
rolling
billows
that
came
roaring
up
astern
to
whirl
us
aloft
amid
hissing
brine
and
passing
left
us
in
great
foaming
hollows
being
got
back
aft
at
last
and
with
no
small
exertion
by
reason
of
the
boat
pitching
i
stared
amazed
to
hear
my
companion
singing
right
joyously
o
martin
she
cried
her
voice
with
the
clear
vital
ring
i
knew
so
well
o
martin
the
wonder
and
glory
of
it
see
yonder
on
these
mighty
waters
death
rides
crying
to
us
but
god
is
there
also
and
if
these
rushing
surges
us
we
dying
shall
find
god
there
and
beholding
her
as
she
sat
her
face
uplifted
to
the
tempest
her
hair
upborne
upon
the
wind
i
marvelled
within
myself
and
the
boat
martin
cries
she
as
we
rose
on
a
hissing
this
dear
brave
boat
see
how
nobly
she
rides
indeed
and
indeed
i
do
love
her
every
timber
and
verily
to
me
awed
by
these
mighty
waters
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
our
little
craft
rose
to
the
seas
buoyant
as
any
cork
now
poised
hissing
foam
high
in
air
now
plunging
dizzily
down
and
ever
the
wind
gathered
fury
until
the
very
air
seemed
full
of
whirling
spindrift
in
a
while
i
took
the
tiller
and
wondered
to
see
my
companion
droop
all
at
once
with
head
bowed
upon
her
hands
are
you
sick
i
cried
is
but
weariness
she
answered
i
slept
no
wink
last
night
why
then
go
forward
and
lie
down
says
i
the
which
she
did
forthwith
and
made
less
business
of
it
than
i
reaching
the
mast
she
paused
thereby
to
behold
my
handiwork
then
going
on
her
knees
crept
beneath
the
awning
and
vanished
from
my
view
left
alone
i
stared
around
me
on
the
raging
tumult
and
beholding
all
its
terrors
my
mind
was
full
of
wonder
of
this
maid
who
could
sing
so
blithely
with
death
all
about
her
and
behold
god
as
it
were
riding
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
presently
she
comes
and
sits
close
beside
me
that
we
might
talk
for
the
wind
was
very
loud
it
was
kind
of
you
to
make
me
so
fair
a
shelter
martin
and
a
bed
also
kind
and
very
thoughtful
but
i
shall
not
sleep
unless
it
be
here
and
why
here
death
hath
more
terrors
in
the
dark
and
i
grow
a
little
fearful
martin
so
saying
she
wrapped
a
about
her
and
spreading
out
the
other
lay
down
thereon
and
so
near
that
i
might
have
touched
her
where
she
lay
and
in
a
while
night
rushed
down
upon
us
and
it
was
dark
but
from
the
dark
her
voice
reached
me
where
she
lay
her
head
pillowed
at
my
feet
and
i
crouching
above
her
strove
to
shelter
her
somewhat
from
the
lashing
spray
and
buffeting
wind
thus
in
despite
of
raging
tempest
we
contrived
to
make
each
other
hear
though
with
difficulty
talking
on
this
wise
she
are
you
afraid
myself
no
she
have
you
then
no
fears
of
death
myself
i
have
prayed
for
it
ere
now
she
and
vainly
for
god
instead
hath
made
you
very
hale
and
strong
myself
aye
for
a
purpose
she
what
purpose
here
seeing
i
held
my
peace
she
questioned
me
again
was
your
purpose
the
slaying
of
my
father
he
is
an
old
man
and
feeble
myself
he
plotted
the
downfall
of
our
house
and
slew
my
father
she
and
so
you
have
prayed
for
vengeance
myself
i
have
she
and
god
hath
denied
you
this
also
should
you
die
you
go
to
him
innocent
of
your
enemy
blood
myself
aye
but
if
i
live
she
you
shall
grow
wiser
mayhap
and
forgetting
the
ill
that
lies
behind
you
reach
out
to
the
good
that
lieth
before
myself
and
what
of
my
just
vengeance
she
vengeance
is
but
for
the
weak
of
soul
is
only
the
strong
can
forgive
myself
what
of
my
sacred
vow
what
of
my
many
prayers
for
vengeance
she
empty
breath
myself
dare
you
say
so
she
i
dare
more
for
lying
here
with
death
all
about
us
i
tell
you
martin
conisby
despite
your
size
and
strength
you
are
no
better
than
a
pitiful
peevish
child
ha
cried
i
fiercely
bending
over
her
in
the
dimness
until
i
might
stare
into
her
eyes
wide
and
dark
in
the
pale
oval
of
her
face
will
ye
dare
a
child
says
she
again
nodding
at
me
lost
and
wilful
and
very
selfish
with
no
thought
above
martin
conisby
and
his
wrongs
nay
scowl
not
nor
grind
your
teeth
is
vain
for
how
may
i
that
fear
not
god
dreadful
tempest
stoop
to
fear
poor
martin
conisby
stoop
madam
i
cried
hoarsely
aye
stoop
says
she
the
wrongs
you
have
endured
have
plunged
you
to
the
very
deeps
have
stripped
you
of
your
manhood
and
yet
yours
is
no
murderer
face
even
when
you
scowl
and
clench
your
fist
was
so
you
looked
when
you
fought
that
rough
boy
on
my
behalf
so
many
years
ago
when
you
were
sir
martin
the
and
i
was
princess
damaris
and
now
martin
you
that
were
my
playmate
and
had
forgot
you
that
were
so
ready
to
fight
on
my
behalf
in
this
desolation
there
is
none
you
may
do
battle
with
for
my
sake
saving
only
martin
conisby
now
here
she
turned
her
face
hid
from
me
a
fold
of
the
great
and
spake
no
more
and
i
crouched
above
her
staring
down
at
her
muffled
form
outstretched
thus
at
my
mercy
felt
my
quivering
fist
relax
felt
my
brutish
anger
cower
before
her
trust
and
fearlessness
and
so
leaning
across
the
tiller
i
stared
away
into
the
raging
dark
and
now
it
seemed
that
the
soul
of
me
had
sunk
to
deeps
more
black
and
groping
blindly
there
hungered
for
the
light
so
all
night
long
we
drove
before
the
tempest
through
a
pitchy
gloom
full
of
the
hiss
of
mighty
seas
that
roared
past
us
in
the
dark
like
raging
giants
and
all
night
long
she
lay
her
head
pillowed
at
my
feet
sleeping
like
a
wearied
child
and
her
long
hair
within
touch
of
my
hand
chapter
xxiii
divers
perils
and
dangers
at
sea
towards
dawn
the
wind
abated
more
and
more
and
glancing
into
the
lightening
east
i
saw
the
black
pierced
as
it
were
by
a
sword
of
glory
a
single
vivid
ray
that
smote
across
the
angry
waters
waxing
ever
more
glorious
until
up
flamed
the
sun
before
whose
joyous
beams
the
sullen
clouds
scattered
little
by
little
and
melted
away
and
now
i
that
was
doomed
to
be
my
own
undoing
instead
of
thanking
that
merciful
god
who
had
delivered
us
from
such
dire
peril
must
needs
scowl
upon
this
kindly
sun
and
fall
again
to
my
black
humours
for
the
immediate
dangers
past
i
began
to
ponder
the
future
and
inwardly
to
rage
against
that
perverse
fate
the
which
was
driving
me
whither
it
would
so
crouched
chin
on
fist
scowling
across
these
tempestuous
waters
for
though
the
wind
was
fallen
the
seas
ran
very
high
within
myself
i
cursed
adam
penfeather
and
all
his
works
you
are
hungry
martin
turning
about
i
beheld
my
companion
sitting
up
regarding
me
with
eyes
that
belied
her
solemn
mouth
how
should
you
know
this
you
frown
martin
though
the
storm
is
done
and
we
alive
yet
you
frown
have
patience
and
you
shall
eat
and
sleep
i
want
neither
one
nor
other
i
began
and
you
are
wet
martin
is
no
matter
and
cold
the
sun
shall
warm
me
so
you
shall
eat
and
lie
here
i
the
sunshine
and
sleep
and
away
she
goes
to
vanish
under
the
dripping
forward
the
which
had
served
its
purpose
admirably
well
whiles
i
perceiving
the
waves
subsiding
and
the
wind
blowing
steady
and
fair
laid
our
course
due
again
and
lashing
the
helm
went
forward
to
shake
out
the
reefs
finding
it
no
easy
task
what
with
the
stiffness
of
my
cramped
limbs
and
the
pitching
of
the
boat
howbeit
was
done
at
last
but
coming
back
i
tripped
across
a
thwart
and
fell
cursing
are
you
hurt
she
questioned
stooping
over
me
whereupon
for
very
shame
i
turned
my
back
answering
short
and
ungraciously
and
sat
frowning
like
the
sullen
rogue
i
was
whiles
she
busily
set
forth
the
wherewithal
to
break
our
fast
and
singing
softly
to
herself
i
told
you
i
was
an
ill
rogue
and
rough
says
i
bitterly
why
so
you
did
says
she
meeting
my
scowl
with
her
wide
calm
gaze
also
you
are
hungry
and
the
food
is
unspoiled
despite
the
storm
come
and
eat
so
i
ate
though
with
mighty
ill
grace
and
found
little
savour
in
the
food
for
all
my
hunger
but
she
waited
on
my
wants
with
heedful
care
my
surliness
notwithstanding
whose
was
the
hand
set
this
boat
adrift
think
you
says
i
suddenly
nay
was
too
dark
to
see
was
penfeather
says
i
clenching
my
fist
aye
it
was
adam
stake
my
life
o
then
poor
master
adam
she
sighed
how
will
you
pity
a
rogue
i
speak
of
master
penfeather
says
she
if
he
indeed
cut
the
boat
adrift
it
was
doubtless
because
the
battle
was
going
against
him
and
he
did
this
to
save
me
hereupon
i
laughed
and
she
flushing
angrily
turns
her
back
on
me
pray
you
she
questioned
when
may
we
hope
to
reach
the
island
and
be
free
of
each
other
or
unless
the
storm
hath
driven
us
further
than
i
judge
and
now
our
meal
done
she
sets
away
everything
in
its
appointed
place
and
thereafter
sat
watching
the
sea
all
foam
and
sparkle
beneath
the
young
sun
and
presently
a
sigh
brake
from
her
and
she
turned
her
anger
forgotten
quite
o
cries
she
is
joy
to
be
alive
to
breathe
such
air
and
behold
such
a
glory
of
sea
and
sky
look
around
us
martin
and
give
thanks
and
truly
the
sea
was
smooth
enough
save
for
a
long
rolling
swell
out
of
the
east
and
with
a
soft
and
gentle
wind
to
abate
the
generous
heat
are
you
not
glad
to
be
alive
martin
says
she
to
what
end
i
answered
of
what
avail
is
life
to
me
cast
away
on
a
desolate
island
desolate
says
she
starting
do
you
mean
we
shall
be
alone
aye
i
do
but
surely
says
she
with
troubled
look
surely
master
adam
will
fetch
us
away
there
is
a
chance
and
if
not
god
knoweth
says
i
gloomily
is
a
small
island
as
i
learn
little
known
and
out
of
the
track
of
vessels
yet
a
ship
may
come
thither
to
our
relief
and
if
one
doth
not
then
must
we
tempt
the
sea
again
in
our
boat
i
am
no
navigator
and
these
seas
are
strange
to
me
howbeit
says
she
bravely
we
have
good
store
of
provisions
and
when
they
are
gone
how
then
think
you
i
think
you
do
lack
for
sleep
go
take
your
rest
mayhap
you
shall
waken
a
little
bolder
and
less
despairing
and
you
says
i
you
that
so
look
on
all
this
as
a
joyous
adventure
joyous
ah
god
she
cried
do
you
think
because
i
do
not
weep
that
my
heart
is
not
full
of
misery
and
grief
to
lose
thus
home
and
friends
and
country
and
live
and
solitary
with
such
as
you
that
think
but
on
your
own
selfish
woes
and
in
your
big
body
bear
the
soul
of
a
fretful
babe
i
hate
you
martin
conisby
scorn
and
despise
you
and
now
give
me
the
tiller
and
begone
to
your
sleep
saying
which
she
pointed
where
she
had
spread
the
cloaks
hard
by
the
midship
thwart
and
i
amazed
by
her
fierce
outburst
suffered
her
to
take
the
tiller
from
my
hold
and
coming
amidships
laid
myself
down
even
as
she
had
commanded
but
no
thought
of
sleep
had
i
rather
i
lay
that
i
might
watch
her
furtively
beneath
my
arm
where
she
sat
head
aloft
cheeks
flushed
and
bosom
tempestuous
and
despite
her
beauty
a
very
termagant
shrew
i
thought
her
then
all
at
once
i
saw
a
tear
fall
and
another
and
she
that
had
sung
undaunted
to
the
tempest
and
outfaced
its
fury
sat
bitterly
weeping
like
any
maid
yet
giving
due
heed
to
our
course
none
the
less
presently
chancing
to
look
my
way
she
catches
me
watching
her
and
knits
her
slender
brows
at
me
get
you
to
sleep
says
she
o
get
you
to
sleep
nor
trouble
my
grief
hereupon
and
feeling
mighty
guilty
i
pillowed
my
head
and
closing
my
eyes
presently
fell
to
sweet
and
dreamless
slumber
chapter
xxiv
how
we
came
to
black
bartlemy
island
martin
martin
look
i
started
up
and
rubbing
sleep
from
my
eyes
turned
to
gaze
whither
she
pointed
and
there
faint
and
far
above
the
rolling
blue
of
the
seas
rose
a
blue
shape
is
the
island
martin
our
voyaging
is
nigh
ended
aye
is
the
island
says
i
is
like
an
island
of
dream
martin
nay
is
real
enough
quoth
i
and
solitary
there
is
a
perspective
glass
in
the
locker
yonder
martin
master
adam
was
vastly
thoughtful
quoth
i
bitterly
and
reaching
the
glass
i
gave
it
to
her
will
you
not
look
at
the
island
she
questioned
wonderingly
nay
i
shall
see
more
than
enough
of
it
ere
long
do
you
give
me
the
tiller
and
view
it
as
you
will
i
see
rocks
says
she
after
some
while
ha
a
barren
place
as
i
thought
nay
there
are
trees
many
trees
o
is
wonderful
and
so
she
sat
viewing
it
all
untiring
every
moment
discovering
some
new
marvel
but
i
fell
to
my
old
black
humour
since
to
me
this
island
was
no
better
than
a
prison
by
we
were
come
so
close
that
i
might
see
the
place
very
well
a
smallish
island
with
sheer
cliffs
very
jagged
and
grim
where
the
seas
broke
in
foam
and
crowned
with
many
and
divers
trees
beyond
which
rose
greeny
slopes
with
more
trees
that
mounted
up
and
up
to
a
lofty
summit
of
rocks
and
brush
being
within
some
two
miles
of
these
forbidding
cliffs
i
steered
to
fetch
a
compass
about
the
island
and
so
presently
opened
a
bay
of
white
sand
with
cliffs
beyond
and
before
a
sheet
of
placid
water
or
lagoon
shut
off
from
the
sea
by
a
semicircular
such
as
adam
had
described
in
his
story
and
now
bethinking
me
that
by
his
account
this
was
the
only
means
of
landing
upon
the
island
i
stood
for
this
reef
against
which
the
foaming
seas
dashed
with
a
mighty
roaring
looking
for
that
narrow
channel
through
the
reef
that
opening
amid
these
breakers
whereby
we
might
steer
into
those
calm
waters
beyond
and
presently
sure
enough
i
espied
it
in
the
middle
of
the
reef
even
as
adam
had
said
and
putting
up
the
helm
ran
for
it
straightway
an
evil
enough
place
it
looked
perilously
narrow
and
with
mighty
seas
that
broke
in
thunderous
spray
to
right
and
left
of
it
insomuch
that
heedful
of
adam
warning
and
all
too
late
i
was
minded
to
bear
up
and
stand
away
plying
off
and
on
until
the
waves
should
have
moderated
but
in
my
folly
i
had
sailed
too
near
and
now
swept
onward
by
some
current
the
boat
responding
no
more
to
her
helm
was
borne
on
at
speed
so
thus
helpless
and
at
mercy
of
the
seas
we
drove
straight
for
this
perilous
channel
until
i
had
some
desperate
hope
that
she
might
make
it
on
we
sped
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
spume
of
the
breakers
was
all
about
us
and
i
deafened
by
their
roar
but
this
roar
was
pierced
suddenly
by
a
cry
o
martin
god
pity
us
look
turning
my
head
i
saw
a
hugeous
wave
hard
upon
us
felt
my
companion
arms
about
me
and
then
deafened
blinded
choking
i
was
whirled
aloft
on
this
mighty
sea
tossed
buffeted
hurled
into
blinding
sunlight
buried
beneath
green
deeps
and
expectant
of
death
suddenly
found
myself
face
down
on
warm
sands
wherein
my
griping
fingers
clutched
desperately
against
the
of
the
sea
so
lay
i
gasping
and
gripping
this
kindly
earth
and
waited
to
do
battle
for
what
remained
of
life
hearkening
for
the
fierce
hiss
of
that
great
wave
that
was
to
bear
me
back
to
the
horror
of
those
green
deeps
the
which
should
bury
me
for
ever
instead
i
heard
the
gentle
drowsy
lapping
of
water
all
about
me
and
opening
my
eyes
beheld
myself
lying
on
the
edge
of
those
white
sands
that
bordered
the
lagoon
while
behind
me
the
seas
thundered
impotent
against
the
reef
and
now
little
by
little
i
saw
that
the
great
wave
must
have
borne
me
hither
in
miraculous
fashion
and
lying
thus
bruised
and
spent
i
must
needs
remember
how
adam
had
experienced
the
like
but
all
at
once
i
staggered
up
to
my
feet
and
began
staring
hither
and
thither
then
as
my
brain
cleared
and
strength
came
back
i
took
to
running
along
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
like
one
demented
staring
down
into
those
placid
waters
and
searching
the
white
sands
with
eyes
of
dreadful
expectancy
yet
nowhere
could
i
discover
sign
or
trace
of
my
companion
none
the
less
i
continued
to
run
aimlessly
back
and
forth
heedless
of
my
going
slipping
and
stumbling
and
often
falling
but
never
staying
my
search
until
the
sweat
poured
from
me
and
ever
as
i
ran
i
kept
repeating
these
words
to
myself
over
and
over
again
adam
comrade
nicholas
frant
was
cast
safe
ashore
with
him
thus
i
ran
to
and
fro
gasping
these
words
to
myself
until
tripping
over
a
piece
of
driftwood
i
lay
bruised
and
spent
howbeit
i
forced
myself
up
again
and
my
search
and
this
time
with
more
method
for
i
swore
to
myself
that
i
would
find
her
or
perish
also
to
this
end
i
determined
to
get
me
out
upon
the
reef
now
to
come
thither
i
must
needs
climb
over
certain
rocks
so
came
i
thither
and
breathless
with
haste
made
shift
to
mount
these
rocks
heedless
of
bruises
or
bleeding
hands
and
reaching
the
summit
at
last
paused
all
at
once
she
lay
face
down
almost
below
these
rocks
outstretched
within
a
little
cove
and
her
long
wet
hair
like
drifted
seaweed
all
about
her
now
seeing
how
still
she
lay
a
great
sickness
seized
me
so
that
i
sank
weakly
to
my
knees
and
crouched
thus
a
while
and
with
no
strength
nor
will
to
move
at
last
and
very
slowly
i
made
my
way
the
rocks
and
being
within
the
little
cove
found
myself
all
trembling
and
holding
my
breath
then
though
the
soft
sand
deadened
all
sound
of
my
going
i
crept
forward
so
came
i
where
she
lay
her
wet
draperies
clinged
fast
about
her
and
standing
above
this
stilly
form
i
looked
down
upon
her
slender
shapeliness
yet
feared
to
touch
her
and
now
i
saw
that
one
sleeve
was
torn
away
and
upon
her
round
white
arm
the
marks
my
cruel
hands
had
wrought
damaris
says
i
falling
on
my
knees
beside
her
and
the
word
was
a
groan
and
in
that
moment
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
and
in
her
eyes
methought
to
read
wonder
and
a
sudden
great
joy
martin
she
whispered
o
thank
god
and
so
hid
her
face
again
now
being
yet
on
my
knees
i
looked
from
her
to
the
blue
heaven
and
round
about
me
like
one
that
wakes
upon
a
new
world
chapter
xxv
how
i
was
haunted
of
black
bartlemy
are
you
hurt
says
i
at
last
indeed
she
answered
all
over
yet
am
i
alive
and
there
the
wonder
the
wave
cast
me
into
the
lagoon
and
i
crept
ashore
here
then
methought
you
surely
dead
and
i
alone
within
these
solitudes
and
so
i
swooned
martin
being
afraid
of
the
loneliness
yes
martin
even
fellow
as
rough
as
i
is
better
than
loneliness
yes
martin
though
your
arms
be
bruised
by
my
handling
for
this
i
i
would
crave
your
pardon
is
all
forgot
says
she
making
shift
to
cover
up
her
arm
but
your
hand
is
bleeding
a
scratch
have
you
no
other
hurts
a
bruise
or
so
and
did
you
come
me
martin
yes
are
you
glad
to
find
me
alive
yes
even
a
brandon
is
better
than
nobody
martin
but
at
this
i
arose
albeit
stiffly
and
turned
away
whither
would
you
go
she
questioned
to
seek
some
shelter
ere
night
catch
us
shall
i
not
come
with
you
can
you
walk
hereupon
she
made
to
rise
but
getting
to
her
knees
flinched
and
bit
her
lip
i
so
bruised
martin
says
she
why
then
bide
you
here
yonder
cleft
i
the
rock
should
serve
for
howbeit
i
go
look
so
i
limped
across
the
beach
to
where
showed
a
great
fissure
in
the
cliff
hard
beside
a
lofty
tree
being
come
within
this
cleft
i
found
it
narrow
suddenly
and
at
the
end
a
small
cave
very
dry
and
excellent
suited
to
our
purpose
moreover
close
at
hand
was
a
little
rill
that
bubbled
among
mossy
rocks
mighty
pleasant
to
be
heard
and
hereabouts
grew
all
manner
of
vines
shrubs
and
fern
of
these
i
gathered
goodly
quantity
and
strowing
them
within
the
cave
therewith
made
a
very
passable
bed
which
done
i
went
back
where
she
lay
her
wet
garments
in
the
warm
sun
as
well
as
she
might
martin
says
she
mighty
doleful
i
have
lost
my
comb
and
all
my
hairpins
i
will
fashion
you
others
aye
but
the
boat
martin
our
dear
brave
boat
i
will
seek
what
remains
of
her
and
our
stores
all
lost
martin
i
can
find
more
where
among
the
rocks
and
on
the
trees
there
should
be
no
lack
of
fruit
and
fish
according
to
adam
nay
but
sighed
she
shaking
woeful
head
even
though
we
contrive
to
live
thus
yet
here
must
we
far
from
our
kind
with
small
hopes
of
relief
and
destitute
of
all
things
to
our
comfort
why
look
now
says
i
here
in
my
pocket
is
a
tinder
box
the
which
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
here
in
my
belt
a
good
stout
knife
which
is
another
comfortable
thing
and
yonder
is
a
cave
dry
and
airy
shall
make
you
a
goodly
chamber
so
take
comfort
at
least
and
drawing
my
knife
i
betook
me
to
whetting
the
blade
on
the
sole
of
my
damp
shoe
glancing
up
at
last
i
found
my
companion
regarding
me
with
strange
expression
methinks
you
are
greatly
changed
says
she
how
changed
in
the
boat
you
did
nought
but
cry
out
and
rail
fortune
but
now
martin
now
says
i
the
sun
is
low
and
night
cometh
apace
in
these
latitudes
let
me
know
you
sheltered
ere
it
be
dark
and
sheathing
my
knife
i
rose
then
seeing
what
effort
she
made
to
come
to
her
knees
i
reached
her
my
hand
aiding
her
up
to
her
feet
so
she
takes
a
step
and
stifling
a
cry
of
pain
would
have
fallen
but
for
my
arm
o
martin
says
she
with
rueful
shake
of
the
head
i
fear
i
can
not
walk
lean
on
me
is
vain
says
she
catching
her
breath
i
can
not
set
this
foot
to
ground
have
you
any
bones
broke
nay
is
none
so
bad
as
that
where
your
hurt
my
knee
my
ankle
and
i
direly
bruised
martin
but
you
can
not
sleep
out
here
i
needs
must
the
sand
is
warm
and
soft
to
my
bed
there
is
a
better
waiting
you
in
the
cave
yonder
but
if
i
can
not
walk
martin
why
then
says
i
why
then
you
must
suffer
that
i
carry
you
i
fear
i
am
greatly
heavy
martin
as
to
that
says
i
and
lifting
her
as
gently
as
i
might
began
to
bear
her
across
the
beach
and
after
we
had
gone
thus
some
way
she
spoke
i
fear
me
i
am
vastly
heavy
no
says
i
keeping
my
gaze
before
me
yet
you
go
very
slowly
is
that
i
would
not
jostle
you
and
the
sand
is
belike
martin
most
true
says
i
pretending
to
stumble
why
then
i
pray
you
take
your
time
at
this
i
ventured
to
glance
down
at
her
but
saw
no
more
than
the
curve
of
a
cheek
and
the
tip
of
a
little
ear
and
staring
at
this
came
very
near
blundering
into
a
rock
so
i
bore
her
into
the
rocky
cleft
already
full
of
shadow
taking
due
heed
in
my
going
yet
mighty
conscious
of
all
the
yielding
softness
of
her
none
the
less
your
clothes
are
very
damp
says
i
they
will
be
dry
ere
morning
she
answered
her
voice
muffled
i
had
best
light
a
fire
then
there
is
no
need
is
very
warm
i
do
think
is
good
against
wild
beasts
and
the
like
says
i
why
then
as
you
will
martin
reaching
the
little
cave
at
last
she
would
have
had
me
set
her
down
but
i
bade
her
lie
still
and
getting
to
my
knees
within
the
cave
i
laid
her
upon
her
ferny
bed
whereat
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
why
martin
says
she
snugging
down
here
is
wondrous
soft
bed
and
fragrant
serve
until
i
can
contrive
a
better
quoth
i
and
coming
without
the
cave
stood
looking
down
on
her
while
the
night
deepened
about
us
apace
and
what
of
you
martin
i
shall
sleep
here
beyond
the
fire
do
you
think
there
be
any
wild
beasts
hereabouts
god
knoweth
says
i
howbeit
you
may
sleep
secure
and
fear
nothing
i
know
that
o
i
know
that
says
she
gently
do
you
lack
for
aught
only
sleep
martin
why
then
i
set
about
making
the
fire
so
i
fell
to
gathering
twigs
and
driftwood
of
which
there
was
no
lack
and
taking
out
my
albeit
the
tinder
was
still
damp
soon
contrived
to
have
the
fire
crackling
right
merrily
this
done
and
with
store
of
fuel
to
hand
i
scooped
me
out
a
hollow
in
the
warm
sand
and
lying
therein
found
myself
very
well
the
aches
of
my
many
bruises
notwithstanding
the
night
air
struck
chill
through
my
damp
garments
but
now
stretched
in
the
comfort
of
the
fire
there
grew
within
me
a
great
wonder
at
our
miraculous
deliverance
and
this
led
me
to
ponder
upon
our
present
situation
cast
thus
destitute
upon
this
lonely
island
where
devoid
of
every
comfort
and
necessity
we
must
needs
live
in
barbarous
fashion
as
best
we
might
until
either
penfeather
should
come
to
our
relief
or
we
be
taken
off
by
some
chance
vessel
and
supposing
thinks
i
that
neither
chance
befall
and
we
doomed
to
drag
out
our
days
to
their
miserable
end
here
i
must
needs
bethink
me
of
all
the
woeful
tales
i
had
heard
of
marooners
or
poor
shipwrecked
mariners
who
by
reason
of
wretchedness
and
hardship
had
run
mad
or
become
baser
than
the
brutes
and
now
i
must
needs
take
out
and
read
penfeather
crumpled
letter
and
bethinking
me
how
in
my
wicked
folly
i
had
cast
overboard
the
packet
of
instructions
whereby
we
must
at
least
have
found
all
those
stores
he
made
mention
of
from
cursing
him
i
straightway
fell
to
bitter
recriminations
of
my
vain
self
are
you
asleep
martin
no
here
i
heard
her
sigh
and
a
rustle
as
she
turned
on
her
leafy
couch
o
martin
surely
god
hath
had
us
in
his
care
to
bring
us
safe
through
so
many
dangers
and
methinks
his
gentle
hand
will
be
over
us
still
have
you
no
fear
of
what
is
to
be
none
martin
not
now
but
had
i
found
myself
alone
here
hurt
and
helpless
in
the
dark
and
really
alone
o
methinks
i
should
have
died
indeed
or
lost
my
wits
and
perished
so
o
truly
truly
god
is
infinitely
merciful
thus
and
all
unknowing
she
rebuked
my
ungrateful
despondency
for
thinks
i
if
she
a
woman
accustomed
to
ease
and
comfort
may
thus
front
our
desperate
fortunes
undismayed
and
with
faith
unshaken
how
much
more
should
i
a
man
inured
to
suffering
and
hardened
by
privation
thus
checking
my
gloomy
foreboding
i
too
breathed
a
prayer
to
god
for
his
infinite
mercies
and
thereafter
fell
to
pondering
how
i
might
supply
our
more
pressing
needs
with
such
small
means
as
i
possessed
and
so
in
a
while
dozed
off
to
sleep
i
started
up
knife
in
hand
to
find
the
moon
very
big
and
bright
flooding
the
world
with
a
radiance
wondrous
to
behold
and
blinking
drowsily
i
wondered
what
had
waked
me
now
as
i
gazed
about
me
the
place
seemed
all
at
once
to
take
on
an
evil
look
what
with
its
steepy
sides
with
tangled
vines
and
bushes
and
pierced
here
and
there
with
black
holes
and
fissures
and
i
shivered
the
fire
being
low
i
minded
to
replenish
it
was
groping
for
my
fuel
when
i
started
and
remained
peering
up
at
the
cliff
above
with
ears
on
the
stretch
and
every
nerve
the
night
was
very
calm
and
still
for
the
wind
had
died
away
and
save
for
the
distant
murmur
of
the
surf
beyond
the
reef
nought
was
to
hear
then
and
all
at
once
from
one
of
those
black
holes
in
the
rock
above
i
heard
a
sighing
breath
and
therewith
a
faint
scuffling
slowly
and
cautiously
i
got
to
my
feet
and
with
knife
gripped
ready
began
to
creep
thither
and
now
within
one
of
these
gloomy
crevices
in
the
i
saw
a
crouching
shape
that
as
i
drew
nearer
sprang
away
with
a
snort
and
clatter
and
i
saw
this
was
a
large
goat
and
surely
no
poor
wight
ever
more
relieved
than
i
as
sheathing
my
knife
i
wiped
the
sweat
from
me
and
now
to
relief
was
added
a
mighty
satisfaction
for
where
was
one
goat
would
be
others
thus
my
fears
allayed
and
bethinking
me
how
savoury
was
a
mess
of
i
fell
at
the
mouth
like
the
hungry
animal
i
was
having
no
more
mind
to
sleep
and
the
moon
so
marvellous
bright
i
wandered
forth
of
these
shadowy
rocks
and
being
upon
the
sands
stood
to
look
about
me
before
me
stretched
the
wide
ocean
a
desolation
of
heaving
waters
that
rolling
shorewards
broke
in
splendour
the
moon
to
my
right
lay
a
curve
of
silver
beach
backed
by
cliffs
and
groves
of
stately
palms
and
to
my
left
and
hard
beside
these
rocks
was
a
great
and
lofty
tree
now
observing
this
tree
more
closely
its
mighty
writhen
branches
and
gnarled
roots
and
how
it
stood
close
against
the
opening
in
the
cliff
an
uneasy
feeling
possessed
me
that
this
tree
and
its
immediate
surroundings
were
all
familiar
almost
as
i
had
seen
it
before
though
i
knew
this
could
not
be
so
stood
i
chin
in
hand
staring
about
me
and
ever
my
unease
grew
and
then
so
that
night
martin
the
moon
being
high
and
bright
i
came
to
that
stretch
of
silver
sand
where
they
lay
together
rigid
and
pale
and
though
i
had
no
tool
but
his
dagger
and
a
piece
of
driftwood
i
contrived
to
bury
them
the
great
pimento
tree
that
stood
beside
the
and
both
in
the
same
grave
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
though
adam
had
repeated
the
words
in
my
ear
insomuch
that
i
glanced
round
as
almost
expecting
to
see
him
so
then
it
was
here
black
bartlemy
had
died
at
the
hands
of
the
poor
tortured
spanish
lady
and
here
they
lay
buried
their
bones
mouldering
together
within
a
yard
of
me
and
standing
in
this
dismal
spot
i
must
needs
mind
adam
narrative
and
great
was
my
pity
for
this
poor
spanish
lady
in
a
while
i
got
me
back
to
the
fire
and
lying
down
fain
would
have
slept
but
my
mind
was
full
of
adam
story
howbeit
after
some
while
what
with
fatigue
and
the
warmth
of
the
fire
slumber
took
me
but
in
my
sleep
the
dead
arose
and
stood
fronting
each
other
beneath
a
pallid
moon
bartlemy
in
all
the
bravery
of
velvet
and
lace
and
flowing
periwig
and
the
spanish
lady
tall
and
proud
and
deadly
pale
and
now
as
she
shrank
from
his
evil
touch
i
saw
that
her
face
was
the
face
of
joan
brandon
sweating
in
dumb
anguish
i
watched
bartlemy
grip
her
in
cruel
hands
and
bend
her
backward
across
his
knee
while
she
stared
up
at
him
with
eyes
of
horror
her
lips
moving
in
passionate
entreaty
but
as
he
bent
over
her
was
a
flash
of
steel
and
he
staggered
back
to
the
great
tree
and
leaning
there
fell
into
a
fit
of
wild
laughter
so
that
the
silver
that
was
shaped
like
a
woman
seemed
to
dance
and
leap
upon
his
breast
then
as
he
swayed
there
laughing
his
life
out
he
raised
his
face
to
the
pale
moon
and
i
saw
that
the
face
of
black
bartlemy
was
my
own
chapter
xxvi
we
come
upon
grim
evidences
of
adam
penfeather
waking
to
a
glory
of
sun
i
found
my
companion
looking
down
on
me
all
where
she
knelt
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
why
joan
says
i
drowsily
my
lady
you
are
groaning
martin
so
i
came
to
you
groaning
says
i
flinching
from
her
touch
was
nought
an
ill
fancy
a
dream
no
more
but
here
is
the
sun
well
up
and
i
nay
you
groaned
and
cried
out
martin
and
is
yet
full
early
and
you
be
mighty
hungry
and
for
that
matter
so
am
i
so
saying
i
rose
and
without
more
ado
strode
away
across
the
sands
towards
the
reef
now
as
i
went
i
chanced
upon
a
great
to
my
joy
and
divers
others
marvellously
shaped
and
tinted
and
chose
such
as
might
serve
us
for
cups
and
the
like
with
these
beneath
my
arm
i
clambered
out
upon
the
reef
and
the
tide
being
out
saw
many
rocks
amongst
which
i
had
soon
collected
good
store
of
as
limpets
oysters
and
others
much
like
to
a
periwinkle
though
larger
filling
my
with
these
i
took
it
my
arm
again
and
went
on
following
the
curve
of
the
reef
clambering
over
these
slimy
rocks
and
found
it
no
small
labour
what
with
my
burden
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
but
i
persevered
seeking
some
fragment
of
our
boat
or
the
stores
wherewith
she
had
been
so
well
laden
yet
and
search
how
i
might
found
nought
to
reward
me
having
thus
traversed
the
whole
reef
and
explored
the
rocks
beyond
very
thoroughly
i
cast
me
down
beside
the
lagoon
to
bathe
my
hands
and
face
and
rest
myself
awhile
presently
chancing
to
turn
my
head
i
saw
a
place
of
trees
hard
by
and
started
up
my
weariness
clean
forgotten
for
divers
of
these
trees
bore
great
clusters
of
yellowish
fruit
the
which
i
knew
for
a
sort
of
plantain
very
wholesome
and
of
delicate
savour
so
casting
out
my
limpets
and
periwinkles
i
hasted
to
pluck
good
store
of
this
fruit
and
with
my
thus
well
laden
hastened
back
to
our
refuge
very
well
content
my
companion
being
absent
i
seated
myself
in
the
shade
and
began
opening
the
oysters
with
my
knife
as
well
as
i
might
in
the
which
occupation
she
presently
found
me
and
grew
very
merry
at
my
clumsy
efforts
and
now
i
noticed
that
she
had
wrought
her
long
hair
into
two
braids
very
thick
and
glossy
also
she
had
somehow
contrived
to
mend
the
rents
in
her
gown
and
her
torn
sleeve
why
you
have
combed
your
hair
says
i
wondering
and
speaking
my
thought
aloud
with
my
fingers
they
must
be
my
comb
until
you
can
make
me
a
better
alack
my
poor
hair
why
then
you
must
have
a
comb
so
soon
as
i
can
contrive
one
but
now
see
the
breakfast
nature
hath
provided
us
withal
and
who
so
full
of
pleased
wonderment
as
she
particularly
as
regarded
the
fruit
which
she
pronounced
delicious
but
my
she
showed
small
liking
for
though
i
found
them
eatable
enough
seeing
her
so
pleased
i
told
her
i
hoped
to
provide
better
fare
very
soon
and
recounted
my
adventure
with
the
goat
but
says
she
how
shall
you
go
and
no
firearms
with
a
bow
and
arrows
have
you
found
these
also
no
i
must
make
them
i
shall
look
out
a
sapling
shaped
to
my
purpose
and
trim
it
with
my
knife
for
the
cord
of
my
bow
i
will
have
leather
strips
cut
from
my
jerkin
aye
but
your
arrows
martin
how
shall
you
barb
them
without
iron
true
says
i
somewhat
hipped
but
in
that
moment
my
eye
lighted
on
a
piece
of
driftwood
i
had
gathered
for
fuel
and
reaching
it
i
laid
it
at
her
feet
there
says
i
pointing
to
the
heads
of
divers
rusty
bolts
that
pierced
it
here
is
iron
enough
to
arm
a
score
of
arrows
but
how
shall
you
make
them
martin
heat
the
iron
soft
and
hammer
it
into
shape
but
you
have
neither
hammer
nor
anvil
stones
shall
do
o
wonderful
she
cried
nay
it
is
not
done
yet
says
i
a
little
shamefaced
and
how
may
i
help
you
watch
me
work
indeed
and
i
will
keep
your
fire
going
so
come
let
us
begin
our
meal
done
i
gathered
twigs
for
kindling
and
a
great
pile
of
driftwood
of
which
was
no
lack
and
with
small
boulders
i
builded
a
fireplace
against
the
cliff
where
we
soon
had
a
fire
drawing
merrily
wherein
i
set
my
precious
piece
of
timber
having
charred
it
sufficiently
i
found
it
an
easy
matter
to
break
out
the
iron
bolts
and
nails
five
of
them
there
were
of
from
four
to
eight
inches
in
length
and
though
the
ends
were
much
corroded
by
the
sea
there
yet
remained
enough
sound
iron
for
my
purpose
and
now
my
bolts
ready
for
the
fire
i
began
to
look
for
some
stone
that
might
serve
me
for
hammer
and
my
companion
likewise
suddenly
as
i
sought
and
mighty
diligent
i
heard
her
cry
out
to
me
and
beholding
her
leaning
in
the
cave
mouth
all
pale
and
trembling
came
running
what
cries
i
struck
by
the
horror
of
her
look
o
martin
she
gasped
o
martin
is
in
there
all
huddled
in
the
darkest
corner
and
i
i
slept
with
it
beside
me
all
night
coming
within
the
cave
i
looked
whither
her
shaking
hand
pointed
and
saw
what
i
took
at
first
for
a
monstrous
egg
and
beyond
this
the
staves
of
a
small
barrel
then
bending
nearer
i
saw
these
were
the
skull
and
ribs
of
a
man
and
this
man
had
died
very
suddenly
for
the
skeleton
lay
face
down
one
bony
arm
folded
under
him
the
other
and
the
skull
shattered
behind
showed
a
small
round
hole
just
above
and
betwixt
the
cavernous
about
the
ribs
were
the
mouldering
remains
of
a
leathern
jerkin
girt
by
a
broad
belt
wherein
was
a
knife
and
a
rusty
sword
but
that
which
pleased
me
mightily
was
a
thing
still
in
these
bony
fingers
and
this
no
other
than
a
heavy
hatchet
so
disturbing
these
poor
bones
as
little
as
need
be
i
took
the
hatchet
and
thereafter
sword
and
knife
and
then
turning
to
go
stopped
all
at
once
for
tied
about
the
bony
neck
by
a
leathern
thong
i
espied
a
shrivelled
parchment
wondering
i
took
this
also
and
coming
without
the
cave
found
my
companion
leaning
as
i
had
left
her
and
very
shaky
o
martin
says
she
shivering
and
i
slept
within
touch
of
it
but
you
slept
very
well
and
he
poor
soul
is
long
past
harming
you
or
any
so
saying
i
smoothed
out
the
crackling
parchment
and
holding
it
in
her
view
saw
this
writ
very
bold
and
clear
benjamin
galbally
slain
of
necessity
june
this
for
a
sign
to
like
rogues
adam
penfeather
will
this
be
our
adam
penfeather
martin
indeed
says
i
there
is
methinks
but
one
adam
penfeather
in
this
world
the
which
is
just
as
well
mayhap
then
he
murdered
this
poor
man
why
the
fellow
had
this
hatchet
in
his
fist
it
hath
lain
rusting
in
his
grasp
all
these
years
methinks
his
blow
came
something
too
late
though
he
must
be
mighty
quick
who
outmatch
penfeather
i
guess
no
this
man
i
take
it
died
in
fight
though
why
adam
must
set
this
placard
about
the
poor
rogue
neck
is
beyond
me
let
us
go
away
martin
this
is
an
evil
place
it
is
says
i
glancing
at
the
great
pimento
tree
that
marked
the
grave
of
the
poor
spanish
lady
and
black
bartlemy
truly
we
will
seek
out
another
habitation
and
that
at
once
howbeit
i
have
gotten
me
my
hammer
and
i
showed
her
the
hatchet
the
which
unlike
the
ordinary
was
furnished
with
a
flat
behind
the
blade
thus
line
drawing
of
the
hatchet
chapter
xxvii
divers
adventures
on
the
island
seeing
my
companion
so
anxious
to
be
gone
i
left
my
fire
to
burn
out
and
giving
her
my
hand
forthwith
turned
my
back
on
this
place
of
death
nor
sorry
to
do
it
following
the
base
of
the
cliff
we
found
an
opening
in
the
rock
vaulted
and
arched
by
nature
so
that
it
was
of
white
sands
bordering
the
lagoon
the
which
we
there
and
then
agreed
to
call
deliverance
in
memory
of
our
escape
what
with
the
soft
sand
and
scattered
rocks
it
was
for
my
companion
but
though
she
limped
painfully
she
held
bravely
on
nevertheless
being
of
a
mighty
resolute
mind
as
this
narrative
will
show
now
as
we
went
slowly
thus
i
pointed
out
caves
and
very
proper
to
our
purpose
but
she
would
have
none
of
them
and
was
forever
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
cliffs
and
greeny
slopes
beyond
let
us
seek
above
says
she
where
there
be
trees
and
mayhap
flowers
for
martin
i
do
love
trees
nay
but
says
i
none
save
a
bird
or
a
goat
may
climb
yonder
let
us
be
patient
and
seek
a
way
martin
and
you
all
bruised
and
lame
nay
i
am
very
well
and
see
yonder
looking
whither
she
would
have
me
i
saw
beyond
this
great
jutting
rock
a
green
opening
in
the
cliffs
with
a
gentle
ascent
o
martin
cries
she
stopping
suddenly
o
martin
is
like
england
like
one
of
our
dear
kentish
lanes
and
indeed
so
it
was
being
narrow
and
grassy
and
shady
with
trees
save
that
these
were
such
trees
as
never
grew
on
english
soil
let
us
go
martin
let
us
go
so
we
began
the
ascent
and
despite
the
blazing
sun
the
slope
being
gradual
found
it
easier
than
it
had
looked
on
we
went
and
though
she
often
stumbled
she
made
nought
of
it
nor
stayed
until
we
were
come
to
a
green
level
or
plateau
whence
the
ground
before
us
trended
downwards
to
a
wondrous
fertile
little
valley
where
ran
a
notable
stream
reedy
banks
here
also
bloomed
flowers
a
blaze
of
varied
colours
and
beyond
these
again
were
flowery
thickets
a
very
maze
of
green
boskages
besplashed
with
the
vivid
colour
of
flower
or
bird
for
here
were
many
such
birds
that
flew
hither
and
thither
on
gaudy
wings
and
filling
the
air
with
chatterings
and
whistlings
strange
to
be
heard
now
beholding
all
this
my
companion
sank
to
the
ground
and
sat
very
still
and
silent
like
one
rapt
in
pleasing
wonder
o
says
she
at
last
and
very
softly
surely
here
is
an
earthly
paradise
o
martin
the
beauty
of
it
yet
these
flowers
have
no
smell
says
i
and
for
these
gaudy
birds
i
would
give
them
all
for
one
honest
english
robin
or
black
bird
but
she
chin
in
hand
sat
upon
this
prospect
as
she
would
never
tire
as
for
me
i
began
to
look
around
and
the
more
i
looked
the
better
i
liked
this
place
pleasantly
shaded
as
it
was
by
trees
and
affording
from
this
eminence
a
wide
view
of
the
sea
the
lagoon
and
deliverance
beach
below
moreover
i
heard
near
by
the
pleasant
sound
of
falling
water
and
drawn
by
this
came
to
a
flowery
thicket
and
forcing
my
way
through
paused
suddenly
as
well
i
might
for
before
me
set
in
the
face
of
a
rock
was
a
door
all
askew
it
hung
and
grown
over
with
a
riot
of
weed
and
vines
and
behind
the
weatherworn
timber
i
saw
the
gloom
of
a
cavern
approaching
this
door
i
found
it
built
with
ship
timbers
exceeding
stout
and
strong
joined
by
great
battens
clamped
with
bolts
and
nails
and
in
the
midst
a
loophole
and
besides
this
i
saw
divers
in
these
timbers
the
which
set
me
now
having
my
hatchet
in
hand
i
set
about
cutting
away
bush
and
vines
and
forcing
wide
the
door
the
which
swung
great
beams
like
jambs
clamped
to
the
rock
i
stepped
into
the
cool
dimness
beyond
the
place
was
irregular
of
shape
but
very
spacious
and
lighted
by
a
narrow
crevice
high
up
that
admitted
a
soft
greeny
glow
very
pleasing
after
the
glare
of
the
sun
by
which
light
i
perceived
that
from
this
cave
two
smaller
caves
opened
now
seeing
this
place
had
once
been
the
abode
of
some
poor
castaway
i
sought
high
and
low
in
hopes
of
finding
something
to
our
use
if
no
more
than
a
broken
cup
but
came
on
nothing
save
the
ruin
of
a
small
table
the
place
was
bare
as
my
hand
i
was
yet
busied
in
my
fruitless
search
when
comes
my
companion
all
wonderment
why
is
as
good
as
any
cottage
cries
she
and
better
than
some
says
i
for
here
is
no
thatch
to
leak
and
no
windows
to
break
and
let
in
the
rain
o
martin
for
a
broom
says
she
looking
around
upon
the
floor
in
dead
leaves
twigs
and
the
like
o
for
a
broom
these
leaves
be
well
enough
but
better
for
a
broom
martin
why
then
a
broom
you
shall
have
says
i
and
coming
without
the
cave
i
cut
twigs
sufficient
to
my
purpose
and
divers
lengths
of
vine
very
strong
and
tough
and
therewith
bound
my
twigs
about
a
stick
i
had
trimmed
for
a
handle
whiles
she
sitting
upon
a
great
stone
that
lay
hard
by
watched
me
with
mighty
interest
you
are
very
clever
martin
says
she
is
very
rough
i
doubt
i
have
seen
many
a
worse
broom
used
in
england
martin
why
serve
mayhap
is
excellent
says
she
and
taking
the
broom
from
me
away
she
limps
with
it
forthwith
and
i
standing
without
the
cave
presently
heard
her
sweeping
away
despite
her
bruises
and
singing
sweet
as
any
mounting
lark
i
now
set
out
to
bring
away
such
things
as
i
had
left
behind
as
my
iron
and
the
the
which
i
held
of
more
account
than
all
the
jewels
in
adam
treasure
and
on
my
way
stopped
to
cut
a
stout
curved
branch
that
i
thought
might
furnish
me
a
powerful
bow
and
another
that
bladed
with
iron
should
become
a
formidable
spear
though
why
my
mind
should
run
to
weapons
of
offence
seeing
that
the
island
so
far
as
i
knew
was
deserted
and
no
wild
beasts
i
know
not
reaching
deliverance
sands
i
paused
to
look
about
me
for
such
pieces
of
driftwood
as
might
serve
us
and
came
on
several
full
of
nails
and
bolts
some
of
these
timbers
being
warped
with
age
and
others
comparatively
new
and
looking
on
these
poor
remains
of
so
many
noble
ships
and
thinking
of
the
numberless
poor
souls
that
had
manned
them
and
gone
to
their
account
i
could
not
but
feel
some
awe
for
these
timbers
as
i
handled
them
and
presently
as
i
laboured
i
spied
a
piece
and
dragging
it
forth
from
sand
and
seaweed
knew
it
for
the
gunwale
of
our
own
boat
this
put
me
in
great
hopes
that
i
might
come
upon
some
of
our
stores
but
though
i
sought
diligently
then
and
for
days
after
i
never
found
anything
but
this
poor
fragment
having
laid
by
such
timbers
as
shewed
iron
of
any
sort
i
went
my
way
and
so
at
last
reached
our
first
shelter
and
what
should
i
espy
upon
a
ledge
of
rock
just
above
me
but
a
goat
for
a
moment
the
creature
blinked
at
me
chewing
busily
then
scrambled
to
its
feet
but
in
that
instant
i
caught
up
a
heavy
stone
that
chanced
handy
and
hurled
it
the
poor
beast
bleated
once
and
rolling
down
the
rock
thudded
at
my
feet
where
i
despatched
it
with
my
knife
my
next
care
was
to
skin
it
which
unlovely
task
i
made
worse
by
my
bungling
howbeit
it
was
done
at
last
and
i
reeking
of
blood
and
sweat
none
the
less
i
persevered
and
having
cleaned
the
carcass
i
cut
therefrom
such
joints
as
might
satisfy
our
immediate
needs
and
setting
them
in
my
with
my
irons
hung
up
the
carcass
within
the
coolest
part
of
the
cave
out
of
reach
of
any
prowling
beast
this
done
i
went
down
to
the
lagoon
and
laved
my
arms
and
hands
and
face
cleansing
myself
as
well
as
i
might
and
so
taking
my
under
one
arm
and
the
reeking
skin
beneath
the
other
i
set
off
now
it
was
and
the
sun
very
hot
insomuch
that
the
sweat
poured
from
me
and
more
than
once
i
must
needs
pause
to
moisten
my
hair
to
keep
off
the
heat
at
last
espying
a
palmetto
that
grew
adjacent
i
made
shift
to
get
me
a
leaf
whereof
with
twigs
to
skewer
and
shape
it
i
made
me
the
semblance
of
a
hat
and
so
tramped
on
again
being
come
to
the
plateau
i
set
down
my
burdens
very
thankful
for
the
kindly
shade
and
the
sweet
cool
wind
that
stirred
up
here
and
turned
to
find
my
companion
regarding
me
and
with
eyes
wide
and
why
what
now
says
i
taking
a
step
towards
her
but
seeing
how
she
shrank
away
i
paused
and
glancing
down
at
myself
saw
my
clothes
all
smirched
with
the
blood
of
the
goat
how
is
it
this
says
i
well
a
little
blood
is
no
great
matter
but
she
still
eyeing
me
mightily
askance
i
grew
angry
ha
quoth
i
you
be
thinking
doubtless
of
the
murders
aboard
ship
and
my
bloody
jerkin
why
then
madam
think
and
grow
as
wise
as
you
may
saying
which
i
strode
off
and
thus
i
presently
heard
the
soothing
sound
of
falling
water
yet
look
where
i
might
could
see
none
save
that
in
the
little
valley
below
being
direly
athirst
i
began
to
seek
for
this
unseen
rill
and
little
by
little
was
led
up
a
steep
acclivity
until
all
at
once
i
found
myself
in
a
right
pleasant
place
for
here
all
set
about
with
soft
mosses
fern
and
flowers
i
beheld
a
great
oval
basin
or
rocky
hollow
some
twelve
feet
across
and
of
pellucid
water
through
which
i
might
see
the
bottom
carpeted
with
mosses
and
in
this
water
my
image
mirrored
and
what
with
the
blood
that
fouled
me
my
shaggy
hair
and
beard
and
the
shapeless
thing
upon
my
head
an
rogue
i
looked
this
pool
was
fed
by
a
little
rill
that
gurgled
down
from
rocks
above
and
having
filled
the
basin
flowed
out
through
a
wide
fissure
and
down
the
cliff
to
lose
itself
amid
flowery
banks
which
it
ran
bubbling
joyously
to
meet
the
river
and
now
having
satisfied
my
thirst
and
found
the
water
very
sweet
and
cool
i
stripped
and
bathing
me
in
this
pool
found
great
solace
and
content
insomuch
that
to
my
great
wonder
i
presently
found
myself
whistling
like
any
boy
at
last
i
got
me
forth
mightily
refreshed
and
that
the
wind
and
sun
might
dry
me
strove
to
cleanse
my
garments
but
finding
it
a
thankless
task
i
got
dressed
at
last
but
my
i
left
folded
beside
the
pool
and
i
much
more
comfortable
therefor
following
the
dancing
rill
i
clambered
down
the
rocks
and
so
into
the
little
valley
where
ran
the
stream
fording
this
i
came
amid
thickets
where
was
a
glory
of
flowers
of
all
colours
but
one
in
especial
i
noticed
white
and
and
here
i
was
often
stayed
by
quickset
and
creeping
plants
their
stems
very
pliant
and
strong
and
of
the
bigness
of
my
little
finger
on
went
i
haphazard
through
a
green
twilight
of
leaves
for
here
as
hath
been
said
were
many
trees
both
great
and
small
some
of
which
were
utterly
strange
to
me
but
others
i
knew
for
plantain
and
the
which
rejoiced
me
greatly
and
hereabouts
i
found
growing
great
bunches
of
black
fruit
like
to
grapes
though
smaller
and
which
i
would
not
dare
touch
until
seeing
divers
birds
peck
at
them
i
ventured
to
taste
and
found
them
excellent
so
gathering
some
of
these
to
stay
my
hunger
i
pressed
on
despite
the
heat
for
from
somewhere
before
me
was
the
roar
of
great
waters
and
forced
me
a
passage
with
my
hatchet
until
this
denser
wood
gave
place
to
a
grove
of
mighty
palm
trees
and
beyond
these
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
great
barren
rock
that
overhung
a
lake
whose
dark
waters
were
troubled
by
a
torrent
hard
by
that
poured
into
it
with
a
great
rushing
sound
a
torrent
of
prodigious
volume
though
of
no
great
height
so
here
thinks
i
is
adam
fall
of
water
and
sitting
down
i
fell
to
viewing
the
place
munching
my
grapes
the
while
opposite
me
the
lake
was
bounded
by
a
sandy
beach
with
trees
beyond
while
beyond
these
again
rose
that
high
hill
whose
barren
rocky
dome
we
had
seen
from
afar
now
the
waters
of
this
lake
flooded
away
through
a
great
rent
in
the
surrounding
rocks
betwixt
which
i
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
distant
sea
and
beholding
this
rushing
cataract
i
must
needs
fall
where
so
great
a
body
of
water
should
come
from
and
to
ponder
on
the
marvels
of
nature
and
from
this
i
got
to
considering
how
we
might
cross
this
stream
supposing
we
should
explore
the
island
i
was
yet
puzzling
this
when
glancing
up
i
found
the
sun
already
westering
wherefore
not
minded
to
be
caught
in
the
dark
i
rose
and
turning
my
back
on
these
troubled
waters
set
out
on
my
return
ever
and
anon
as
i
went
i
caught
glimpses
of
that
rocky
eminence
with
its
silver
thread
of
falling
water
whence
i
had
come
and
guided
by
this
strode
on
amain
bethinking
me
how
best
i
might
cook
the
for
despite
the
grapes
i
was
mightily
an
hungered
but
reaching
the
denser
woods
i
lost
my
way
for
here
nought
was
to
see
but
the
greeny
gloom
of
tangled
thickets
and
boskages
where
i
must
needs
cut
a
path
yet
even
so
i
troubled
myself
with
divers
bunches
of
grapes
that
my
companion
might
prove
my
discovery
thus
my
progress
was
slow
and
wearisome
and
night
found
me
still
forcing
my
way
through
this
tangled
underwood
being
lost
and
in
the
dark
i
sat
me
down
to
wait
for
the
moon
and
stayed
my
hunger
with
the
grapes
meant
for
better
purpose
but
one
bunch
that
methought
the
better
i
preserved
soon
this
leafy
gloom
glowed
with
a
silvery
radiance
and
by
this
light
i
went
on
and
so
at
last
came
upon
the
stream
but
hereabouts
it
ran
fast
and
deep
and
i
must
needs
seek
about
till
i
found
a
ford
thus
the
moon
was
high
as
after
desperate
scramble
i
came
out
upon
our
grassy
plateau
and
saw
the
welcome
glow
of
a
fire
moreover
as
i
approached
i
smelt
right
savoury
and
most
delectable
savour
and
hurrying
forward
saw
my
companion
crouched
upon
that
stone
i
have
mentioned
her
head
bowed
upon
her
hands
hearing
my
step
she
glanced
up
and
rose
to
her
feet
are
you
come
at
last
martin
says
she
in
her
sweet
voice
supper
is
ready
this
hour
and
more
supper
says
i
the
i
made
a
stew
but
fear
is
spoiled
indeed
says
i
it
smells
mighty
appetising
i
had
no
salt
nor
spices
martin
but
in
a
little
garden
yonder
that
is
all
run
wild
i
found
some
sage
and
sweet
herbs
good
says
i
so
she
brought
me
to
the
fire
and
there
in
our
great
was
as
savoury
a
stew
as
ever
greeted
eyes
of
hungry
man
by
her
directions
and
will
all
due
care
i
lifted
this
from
the
fire
and
propping
it
with
stones
we
sat
down
side
by
side
and
now
she
shows
me
two
of
my
smaller
shells
and
dipping
hers
into
the
stew
i
did
the
like
and
though
we
had
no
salt
the
which
set
my
wits
at
work
and
though
we
lacked
for
bread
a
very
excellent
meal
we
made
of
it
and
the
moon
shedding
its
glory
all
about
us
the
meal
done
and
while
she
cleansed
the
things
at
a
rill
that
murmured
hard
by
i
made
up
the
fire
for
after
the
heat
of
the
day
night
struck
chill
and
by
the
time
she
came
back
i
had
the
flame
crackling
merrily
and
now
as
she
sat
over
against
me
on
the
stone
i
saw
she
had
been
weeping
and
she
knowing
i
saw
this
nodded
her
head
scorning
all
subterfuge
i
feared
you
had
met
with
some
mischance
and
lay
hurt
martin
or
worse
you
mean
dead
aye
dead
would
it
have
mattered
so
much
only
that
i
should
have
died
likewise
because
of
the
loneliness
says
i
indeed
she
sighed
staring
into
the
fire
because
of
the
loneliness
i
serve
some
purpose
then
in
the
scheme
of
things
yes
martin
you
teach
a
woman
how
even
in
this
desolation
being
weak
and
defenceless
she
may
trust
to
a
man
honour
and
find
courage
and
great
comfort
in
his
strength
was
foolish
of
me
to
be
at
your
stained
garments
when
you
had
been
slaying
that
i
might
eat
is
all
forgot
says
i
hastily
and
as
for
the
murders
on
the
ship
o
martin
as
if
you
might
ever
make
me
believe
you
had
committed
murder
or
ever
could
you
that
under
all
your
bitterness
are
still
the
same
gentle
boy
i
knew
so
long
ago
and
why
should
you
be
so
sure
of
all
this
and
i
but
what
i
am
says
i
staring
also
into
the
fire
mayhap
because
i
am
a
woman
with
all
a
woman
instinct
to
know
the
evil
from
the
good
hereupon
i
began
telling
her
of
my
exploration
and
describing
the
wonders
i
had
seen
as
the
and
waterfall
whereupon
she
grew
eager
to
explore
the
island
so
soon
as
she
might
in
a
while
i
arose
and
drawing
my
knife
turned
where
i
knew
was
fern
where
away
she
questioned
rising
also
i
must
make
you
a
bed
is
done
martin
and
yours
also
mine
says
i
staring
how
should
you
do
all
this
with
the
old
rusty
sword
martin
come
and
see
so
she
brought
me
to
the
cave
the
moon
flooding
the
place
with
its
pale
radiance
and
i
espied
a
goodly
bed
of
fern
very
neatly
contrived
in
one
corner
bravely
done
says
i
at
least
martin
be
more
easy
than
your
bed
of
sand
and
methinks
you
shall
have
no
ill
dreams
dreams
quoth
i
and
bethinking
me
of
my
last
night
hateful
visions
and
now
beholding
the
beauty
of
her
i
shivered
are
you
cold
no
why
then
martin
wait
says
i
wait
and
hasting
out
i
brought
her
the
grapes
i
had
saved
telling
her
that
though
small
she
would
find
them
sweet
and
wholesome
why
martin
says
she
under
her
breath
as
one
greatly
surprised
why
martin
and
so
vanishes
into
her
little
cave
forthwith
and
never
a
word
of
thanks
now
being
yet
haunted
by
my
dreams
of
yesternight
i
went
forth
into
the
moonlight
and
walked
there
awhile
my
eyes
uplifted
to
the
glory
of
the
heavens
and
now
i
must
needs
bethink
me
of
godby
of
the
dark
lonely
road
of
the
beckoning
light
beyond
and
the
welcoming
arms
of
love
and
hereupon
i
scowled
and
turned
to
stare
away
across
the
placid
sea
dimpling
the
moon
at
the
stilly
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
the
white
curve
of
deliverance
beach
below
but
look
where
i
would
i
could
see
only
the
proud
lovely
face
and
the
great
truthful
eyes
of
this
woman
joan
brandon
even
when
my
scowling
brows
were
bent
on
that
distant
pimento
tree
beneath
whose
towering
shadow
black
bartlemy
had
laughed
his
life
out
so
in
a
while
i
came
within
the
cave
and
found
it
dim
for
the
moonbeam
was
there
no
longer
and
cast
myself
upon
my
bed
very
full
of
gloomy
thoughts
martin
i
thank
you
for
your
grapes
we
will
gather
more
aye
i
found
a
shirt
of
by
the
pool
martin
is
mine
i
have
set
it
by
against
your
need
nay
i
done
with
it
here
is
no
fear
of
knives
in
the
back
are
you
sleepy
martin
no
but
is
plaguy
dark
but
you
are
there
says
she
so
i
do
not
fear
the
dark
i
will
make
a
lamp
here
she
fell
silent
and
i
think
to
sleep
but
as
for
me
i
lay
long
oppressed
by
my
thoughts
aye
verily
says
i
at
last
speaking
my
thought
aloud
as
had
become
my
custom
in
my
solitude
i
will
contrive
a
lamp
for
light
is
a
goodly
thing
now
here
i
heard
a
rustle
from
the
inner
cave
as
she
had
turned
in
her
sleep
for
she
spake
no
word
and
so
despite
my
thoughts
i
too
presently
fell
to
blessed
slumber
now
if
there
be
any
who
reading
this
my
narrative
shall
think
me
too
diffuse
and
particular
in
the
chapters
to
follow
i
do
hereby
humbly
crave
their
pardon
but
maugre
my
reader
weariness
shall
not
abate
one
word
or
sentence
since
herein
i
that
by
my
own
folly
have
known
so
little
of
happiness
do
record
some
of
the
happiest
hours
that
ever
man
knew
so
that
it
is
joy
again
to
write
therefore
to
such
as
would
read
of
rogues
and
roguish
doings
of
desperate
fights
encounters
and
affrays
i
would
engage
him
to
pass
over
these
next
few
chapters
for
he
shall
find
overmuch
of
these
things
ere
i
make
an
end
of
this
tale
of
black
bartlemy
treasure
which
very
proper
advice
having
duly
set
down
i
will
again
to
my
narrative
chapter
xxviii
i
become
a
early
next
morning
having
bathed
me
in
the
pool
and
breakfasted
with
my
companion
on
what
remained
of
our
i
set
to
work
to
build
me
a
fireplace
in
a
fissure
of
the
rock
over
against
the
little
valley
and
close
beside
a
great
stone
smooth
and
that
should
make
me
an
anvil
what
time
my
companion
collected
a
pile
of
soon
we
had
the
fire
going
merrily
and
whilst
my
iron
was
heating
i
chose
a
likely
piece
of
wood
and
splitting
it
with
the
hatchet
fell
to
carving
it
with
my
knife
what
do
you
make
now
martin
here
shall
be
a
spoon
for
you
help
you
in
your
cooking
indeed
it
will
martin
but
you
are
very
skilful
nay
is
simple
matter
says
i
whittling
away
but
very
conscious
of
her
watchful
eyes
i
have
outworn
many
a
weary
hour
carving
things
with
my
knife
given
time
and
patience
a
man
may
make
anything
some
men
says
she
whereat
i
grew
foolishly
pleased
with
myself
the
wood
being
soft
and
dry
and
my
knife
sharp
the
spoon
grew
apace
and
her
interest
in
it
and
because
it
was
for
her
and
she
so
full
of
pleased
wonder
i
elaborated
upon
it
here
and
there
until
having
shaped
it
to
my
fancy
i
drew
my
iron
from
the
fire
and
with
the
glowing
end
burned
out
the
bowl
scraping
away
the
charred
wood
until
i
had
hollowed
it
sufficiently
and
the
spoon
was
finished
and
because
she
took
such
pleasure
in
it
now
and
hereafter
i
append
here
a
rough
drawing
of
it
drawing
of
a
spoon
is
wonderful
cries
she
turning
it
this
way
and
that
is
admirable
it
might
be
better
says
i
wishing
i
had
given
more
labour
to
it
i
want
no
better
martin
and
now
she
would
have
me
make
another
for
myself
nay
mine
can
wait
but
there
is
your
comb
to
make
how
shall
you
do
that
martin
of
wood
like
the
indians
but
take
time
why
then
it
shall
wait
with
your
spoon
first
should
come
necessities
as
what
dear
heaven
they
be
so
many
says
she
with
rueful
laugh
for
one
thing
a
martin
there
is
our
says
i
why
is
very
well
martin
for
a
but
clumsy
a
little
i
would
have
a
pan
with
handles
if
you
could
contrive
and
then
plates
would
be
a
good
thing
handles
says
i
rubbing
my
chin
handles
aye
by
all
means
a
pan
with
handles
but
for
this
we
must
have
clay
and
then
martin
platters
would
be
useful
things
so
they
will
i
nodded
these
i
can
fashion
of
wood
and
then
chairs
and
a
table
martin
true
says
i
growing
gloomy
table
and
chairs
would
be
easy
had
i
but
a
saw
i
could
make
you
shelves
and
a
cupboard
had
i
but
fortuned
to
find
a
saw
instead
of
this
hatchet
nay
martin
says
she
smiling
at
my
doleful
visage
why
this
despond
if
you
can
make
me
so
wondrous
a
spoon
with
nought
but
your
knife
and
a
piece
of
driftwood
i
know
you
will
make
me
chairs
and
table
of
sorts
saw
or
no
aye
if
our
table
be
but
a
board
laid
across
stones
and
our
chairs
the
same
what
more
do
we
need
says
i
sighing
and
scowling
at
my
hatchet
that
it
was
not
a
saw
well
martin
if
there
be
many
goats
in
the
island
and
if
you
could
take
two
or
three
alive
i
have
been
thinking
we
might
use
their
milk
in
many
ways
if
we
had
pans
to
put
the
milk
in
as
butter
and
cheese
if
you
could
make
me
a
press
here
be
of
ifs
martin
and
i
should
not
waste
breath
with
so
many
if
you
were
not
the
man
you
are
as
how
i
questioned
beginning
to
grind
the
hatchet
on
a
stone
a
man
strong
to
overcome
difficulty
and
with
such
clever
hands
here
i
ground
my
hatchet
harder
than
before
but
scowled
at
it
no
longer
and
what
more
would
you
have
i
questioned
if
you
could
make
our
front
door
to
open
and
shut
that
is
easily
done
and
what
else
beside
nay
here
is
enough
for
the
present
we
are
like
to
be
very
busy
people
martin
why
pass
the
time
says
i
and
work
is
a
very
good
thing
quoth
she
thoughtfully
it
is
says
i
grinding
away
at
my
hatchet
again
o
martin
sighs
she
after
awhile
i
grow
impatient
to
explore
our
island
and
so
you
shall
so
soon
as
you
are
strong
enough
and
that
will
be
very
soon
says
she
the
is
life
to
me
and
what
with
this
sweet
air
i
grow
stronger
every
day
meantime
there
is
much
to
be
done
and
here
sit
i
in
idleness
nay
you
are
sharpening
your
axe
and
i
am
talking
to
you
and
wondering
what
you
will
make
next
a
lamp
says
i
how
martin
with
a
shell
the
fat
of
our
goat
rendered
down
and
cotton
from
my
shirt
nay
if
you
so
yearn
for
a
lamp
i
can
do
this
much
good
says
i
rising
meantime
i
turn
carpenter
and
to
begin
with
try
my
hand
at
a
stool
for
you
but
if
you
have
no
saw
martin
i
will
make
me
a
chisel
instead
crossing
to
the
fire
i
found
my
iron
and
taking
it
betwixt
two
flat
pieces
of
wood
that
served
me
for
tongs
i
laid
it
upon
my
stone
anvil
and
fell
forthwith
to
beating
and
shaping
it
with
the
of
my
hatchet
until
i
had
beaten
out
a
blade
some
two
inches
wide
having
cooled
my
chisel
in
the
brook
i
betook
me
to
sharpening
it
on
a
stone
moistened
with
water
and
soon
had
wrought
it
to
a
good
edge
i
now
selected
from
my
timber
a
board
sufficiently
wide
and
laying
this
on
my
began
to
cut
a
piece
from
the
plank
with
hammer
and
chisel
the
which
i
found
a
work
requiring
great
care
lest
i
split
my
wood
and
patience
since
my
chisel
being
of
iron
needed
much
and
repeated
grinding
howbeit
it
was
done
at
last
and
the
result
of
my
labour
a
piece
of
wood
about
two
feet
square
and
behold
the
seat
of
my
stool
now
was
my
companion
idle
for
while
all
this
is
she
sets
the
on
the
fire
with
water
and
collops
of
meat
cut
with
my
knife
and
soon
as
it
simmers
breaks
into
it
divers
herbs
she
had
dried
in
the
sun
and
so
comes
to
watch
and
question
me
at
my
work
yet
turning
ever
and
anon
to
stir
at
the
stew
with
her
new
spoon
whereby
i
soon
began
to
snuff
a
savour
methought
right
appetising
as
time
passed
this
savour
grew
ever
more
inviting
and
my
hunger
with
it
my
mouth
so
that
i
might
scarce
endure
as
i
told
her
to
her
no
small
pleasure
had
i
but
a
handful
of
salt
martin
sighs
she
why
comrade
says
i
pausing
two
wherefore
this
despond
if
you
can
make
stew
so
savoury
and
with
nought
but
flesh
of
an
old
goat
and
a
few
dried
herbs
what
matter
for
salt
at
this
she
laughed
and
bent
to
stir
at
her
stew
again
there
plenty
of
salt
in
the
sea
yonder
says
she
presently
true
but
how
to
come
at
it
how
if
we
boiled
martin
is
method
unknown
to
me
says
i
whittling
at
a
leg
of
my
stool
but
we
can
try
and
now
in
the
seat
of
my
stool
i
burned
three
holes
or
sockets
and
having
trimmed
three
lengths
of
wood
i
fitted
these
into
my
and
there
was
my
stool
complete
this
done
i
must
needs
call
her
from
her
cooking
to
behold
it
and
though
it
was
no
more
than
a
square
of
roughish
wood
set
upon
three
pegs
she
praised
and
viewed
it
as
it
had
been
a
great
elbow
chair
and
cushioned
at
that
hereupon
puffed
up
with
my
success
i
must
immediately
begin
to
think
upon
building
us
a
table
and
chairs
but
being
summoned
to
dinner
i
obeyed
her
gladly
enough
and
she
seated
on
her
stool
with
me
on
the
ground
beside
her
and
our
dish
before
us
we
ate
with
hearty
until
our
hunger
appeased
we
fell
to
talk
she
is
marvellous
how
well
i
eat
myself
is
the
open
air
she
and
the
work
martin
i
have
swept
and
dusted
our
cottage
every
hole
and
corner
myself
and
found
nothing
left
by
its
last
tenant
she
nothing
myself
had
he
but
thought
to
leave
us
a
saw
our
chairs
and
table
would
have
been
the
better
she
then
you
will
make
them
martin
myself
aye
with
time
she
o
is
bravely
determined
and
here
for
a
moment
i
felt
the
light
touch
of
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
myself
they
will
be
very
unlovely
things
very
rough
she
and
very
wonderful
martin
myself
as
to
these
goats
now
is
an
excellent
thought
to
catch
some
alive
and
rear
them
she
i
could
make
you
excellent
cheese
and
butter
myself
if
i
can
not
run
them
down
i
must
contrive
to
wound
one
or
two
with
arrows
she
why
then
martin
why
not
head
your
arrows
with
pebbles
in
place
of
iron
points
myself
good
again
or
i
might
make
a
couple
of
gins
running
nooses
cut
from
the
howbeit
i
try
herewith
i
arose
and
she
also
then
while
she
busied
herself
to
scald
out
our
i
set
off
to
get
my
and
finding
it
where
i
had
left
it
hanging
on
a
rock
to
dry
i
fell
to
myself
for
very
chagrin
for
what
with
the
heat
of
the
rock
and
the
fierce
glare
of
the
sun
here
was
my
all
shrivelled
and
hard
as
any
board
so
stood
i
scowling
at
the
thing
chin
in
hand
and
mightily
cast
down
and
so
she
presently
found
me
and
beholding
my
disconsolate
look
falls
o
martin
says
she
is
well
there
are
some
things
you
can
not
do
saying
which
she
takes
up
the
skin
albeit
it
smelt
none
too
sweet
and
away
she
goes
with
it
into
the
cave
so
i
got
me
back
to
my
carpentry
and
selecting
as
many
boards
as
i
required
for
the
width
of
my
table
fell
to
cutting
them
to
their
proper
lengths
with
hammer
and
chisel
and
despite
the
shade
of
the
mighty
trees
that
girt
us
round
and
the
soft
wind
that
stirred
plaguy
hot
work
i
found
it
but
ever
and
anon
she
would
bring
me
water
in
one
of
our
shells
cool
from
the
spring
or
would
sit
beside
me
as
i
laboured
aiding
me
in
a
thousand
ways
and
showing
herself
vastly
capable
and
thus
as
the
sun
sank
westwards
i
had
all
my
boards
cut
to
an
even
size
and
two
of
the
legs
though
these
being
square
i
must
needs
chop
asunder
with
the
hatchet
yet
i
persevered
being
minded
to
complete
the
work
ere
nightfall
if
possible
but
where
are
your
nails
says
she
where
she
sat
watching
our
nails
be
too
few
and
precious
quoth
i
pausing
to
my
hatchet
i
shall
burn
holes
and
pin
our
table
together
with
pegs
why
then
says
she
readily
let
me
split
and
shape
you
some
pegs
spoke
like
a
true
comrade
says
i
impulsively
sometimes
i
do
forget
you
are
a
woman
she
questioned
as
i
paused
and
i
wondered
to
see
her
eyes
so
bright
and
shining
here
is
twice
you
have
named
me
your
comrade
martin
and
so
will
i
be
so
long
as
i
may
you
sometimes
would
call
me
your
comrade
when
we
played
together
years
ago
and
is
a
good
name
martin
come
now
teach
me
how
i
must
make
these
pegs
for
our
table
so
i
showed
her
how
to
split
divers
lengths
of
wood
and
shape
these
as
round
and
smooth
as
might
be
the
while
i
bored
holes
for
them
with
a
heated
iron
and
thus
we
sat
side
by
side
at
our
labour
seldom
speaking
yet
i
for
one
very
well
content
at
length
with
her
assistance
i
began
setting
the
framework
of
our
table
together
joining
and
pinning
it
with
my
wooden
pegs
driven
mighty
secure
last
of
all
i
laid
the
boards
across
and
pinning
these
in
place
there
was
our
table
and
though
it
was
rude
and
primitive
so
far
as
looks
went
yet
very
serviceable
we
were
to
find
it
well
martin
says
she
when
i
had
borne
it
into
our
cave
methinks
my
shelves
and
cupboard
are
none
so
far
to
seek
here
she
falls
to
patting
this
unlovely
thing
and
viewing
it
as
it
were
the
wonder
of
the
world
and
i
must
needs
leap
upon
it
to
prove
its
strength
is
says
i
giving
it
a
final
shake
but
serve
to
admiration
says
she
smoothing
its
rough
surface
with
gentle
hand
we
will
sup
from
it
which
reminds
me
that
supper
is
to
cook
and
our
meat
nearly
all
gone
martin
though
we
have
plenty
of
plantains
left
so
i
told
her
i
would
go
fetch
what
remained
of
the
carcass
after
supper
so
soon
as
the
moon
rose
and
now
whiles
she
bustled
to
and
fro
i
chose
me
a
little
piece
of
wood
and
sitting
where
i
might
watch
her
at
her
labours
began
to
carve
her
the
hair
pin
i
had
promised
our
third
cave
should
make
us
a
very
good
larder
says
she
busy
at
her
new
table
preparing
supper
aye
is
so
marvellous
cool
aye
i
think
because
the
pool
lieth
above
it
mayhap
indeed
these
are
wonderful
caves
martin
they
are
who
lived
here
before
us
i
wonder
penfeather
like
as
not
why
should
you
think
this
well
that
door
yonder
was
never
a
carpenter
work
yet
is
well
made
and
furnished
with
a
narrow
and
horizontal
to
give
a
lateral
fire
the
which
i
have
seen
but
once
ere
this
then
again
the
timbers
of
this
door
do
carry
many
marks
of
shot
and
adam
penfeather
is
no
stranger
to
such
violence
and
danger
steel
and
bullet
seem
to
follow
him
why
so
martin
he
hath
ever
seemed
a
man
very
quiet
and
gentle
most
unlike
such
rough
as
i
have
seen
hitherto
true
says
i
but
this
attitude
of
mind
is
a
wily
cunning
and
desperate
bloodthirsty
courage
and
determination
worthy
any
pirate
or
buccaneer
of
them
all
why
courage
and
determination
are
good
things
martin
and
as
for
master
penfeather
he
is
as
i
do
know
a
skilful
navigator
and
very
well
read
more
especially
in
the
scriptures
and
methought
your
friend
for
his
own
purposes
quoth
i
and
what
are
these
martin
at
this
i
merely
scowled
at
the
wood
i
was
carving
whereupon
she
questions
me
further
master
adam
is
such
a
grave
and
sober
man
true
says
i
and
so
wise
in
counsel
say
rather
cunning
though
to
be
sure
he
once
had
a
poor
man
beaten
cruelly
wherein
he
was
exactly
right
says
i
grinding
my
teeth
at
memory
of
red
andy
aye
there
penfeather
was
very
right
this
fellow
was
a
vile
and
beastly
rogue
what
dreadful
thing
had
he
done
martin
stared
at
you
says
i
and
stopped
and
glancing
up
found
her
regarding
me
with
look
mighty
strange
did
you
mind
so
much
she
questioned
no
whit
madam
why
should
i
aye
why
indeed
says
she
and
turns
to
her
cooking
again
and
i
to
my
carving
yet
in
a
little
hearing
her
gasp
i
glanced
up
to
find
her
nigh
stifled
with
her
laughter
ha
why
must
ye
laugh
madam
i
demanded
o
martin
says
she
and
must
this
poor
man
be
whipped
and
for
a
mere
look
and
you
so
fierce
withal
i
fear
there
be
many
men
do
merit
whipping
if
this
be
sin
so
great
i
see
no
reason
in
your
laughter
my
lady
quoth
i
scowling
up
at
her
because
you
have
no
gift
of
laughter
my
lord
says
she
and
turns
her
back
on
me
here
i
came
nigh
to
tossing
her
hairpin
into
the
fire
but
seeing
her
turn
her
head
carved
on
for
very
shame
and
are
you
so
very
angry
martin
i
bent
to
sharpen
my
knife
i
would
that
you
might
laugh
yourself
once
in
a
while
martin
i
tested
my
knife
on
my
thumb
you
are
always
so
grave
martin
so
very
solemn
and
young
finding
my
knife
still
blunt
i
went
on
sharpening
it
here
and
all
suddenly
she
was
beside
me
on
her
knees
and
clasps
my
in
hers
indeed
i
had
no
thought
to
anger
you
are
you
truly
angered
or
is
it
only
that
you
are
so
very
hungry
now
here
i
glanced
at
her
and
beholding
all
the
roguish
mischief
in
her
eyes
try
how
i
might
i
could
not
but
smile
too
a
little
of
both
comrade
says
i
though
verily
i
am
a
surly
animal
by
nature
indeed
yes
martin
she
sighs
yet
a
very
comfortable
animal
and
though
strong
and
fierce
and
woefully
trying
at
times
a
very
gentle
animal
to
such
as
know
you
and
do
you
know
me
so
well
better
than
you
think
o
a
great
deal
better
because
i
am
a
woman
and
now
are
we
friends
again
yes
says
i
heartily
yes
and
away
she
goes
to
her
cooking
and
i
mighty
glad
i
had
not
destroyed
her
hairpin
the
which
my
knife
being
sharp
i
began
to
ornament
with
all
sorts
of
elaborations
presently
back
she
comes
spoon
in
one
hand
stool
in
the
other
and
sits
to
watch
me
at
work
what
do
you
make
now
martin
a
pin
for
your
hair
why
is
beautiful
is
scarce
begun
yet
here
she
must
needs
lavish
all
manner
of
praises
on
my
skill
until
i
came
nigh
cutting
myself
how
many
will
you
make
me
martin
as
many
as
you
will
three
should
suffice
why
you
have
a
prodigious
lot
of
hair
do
you
think
so
martin
says
she
glancing
down
at
the
two
great
braids
that
fell
over
her
bosom
to
her
waist
was
well
enough
in
england
but
here
is
greatly
in
my
way
and
hampers
me
in
my
work
i
had
thought
of
cutting
it
off
then
do
why
not
martin
well
says
i
glancing
at
the
nearest
braid
that
showed
coppery
lights
where
the
setting
sun
caught
it
well
because
and
finding
nought
else
to
say
i
fell
to
my
carving
again
and
away
she
goes
to
her
cooking
martin
says
she
at
last
what
do
you
know
of
master
penfeather
where
did
you
fall
in
with
him
and
why
is
his
life
so
threatened
all
by
reason
of
black
bartlemy
treasure
treasure
says
she
and
back
she
comes
and
onto
her
stool
all
in
a
moment
tell
me
of
it
martin
is
a
great
treasure
of
gold
and
jewels
in
such
and
who
is
black
bartlemy
a
foul
rogue
of
a
pirate
that
was
killed
by
a
poor
spanish
lady
and
lieth
buried
with
her
under
the
great
pimento
tree
on
the
beach
yonder
o
martin
says
she
getting
up
that
she
might
behold
the
tree
o
martin
i
knew
i
knew
was
an
evil
place
and
the
poor
lady
died
too
he
killed
her
after
she
had
stabbed
him
how
do
you
know
of
this
adam
penfeather
told
me
he
saw
it
done
hereupon
she
sits
down
and
is
silent
awhile
and
where
is
this
great
treasure
on
this
island
here
says
she
starting
to
her
feet
again
here
martin
aye
was
this
i
was
despatched
to
secure
after
i
had
been
rapped
over
the
head
with
a
and
how
must
you
find
it
i
never
shall
the
secret
of
it
was
in
the
packet
i
tossed
overboard
adam
may
find
it
himself
an
he
will
and
you
have
no
desire
for
this
treasure
none
in
the
world
and
now
at
her
earnest
solicitation
i
told
her
all
my
association
with
adam
of
my
haunted
days
and
nights
aboard
ship
and
my
suspicions
of
tressady
only
i
spoke
nothing
of
adam
avowed
intent
to
steal
the
faithful
friend
to
his
own
purposes
o
wonderful
says
she
when
i
had
done
and
then
again
o
wonderful
so
this
was
why
we
were
cut
adrift
truly
master
penfeather
hath
quick
and
subtle
wits
a
guileful
rogue
and
very
wily
says
i
clenching
my
fist
but
wherein
is
he
rogue
martin
how
quoth
i
was
it
not
a
wicked
vile
and
most
roguish
act
to
set
you
adrift
thus
to
run
the
peril
of
sea
and
a
desolate
island
what
other
could
he
do
martin
and
the
ship
good
as
taken
by
the
mutineers
i
heard
them
shouting
for
me
and
here
she
shivered
true
we
have
faced
perils
have
lost
all
our
stores
but
at
least
here
am
i
safe
with
you
martin
saying
which
she
rose
and
presently
summoned
me
to
our
evening
meal
having
supped
i
took
beneath
my
arm
my
rusty
sword
the
which
i
had
sharpened
and
burnished
as
well
as
i
might
being
minded
to
fetch
what
remained
of
our
goat
but
now
she
comes
very
earnest
to
go
with
me
and
i
agreeing
readily
enough
we
set
out
together
forthwith
chapter
xxix
of
my
encounter
beneath
bartlemy
tree
the
moon
was
very
bright
casting
great
black
shadows
athwart
our
way
and
now
once
our
familiar
surroundings
were
left
behind
we
fell
silent
or
spake
only
in
low
voices
awed
by
the
universal
hush
of
all
things
for
the
night
was
very
still
and
hot
and
breathless
not
a
leaf
stirred
and
no
sound
to
hear
save
the
unceasing
roar
of
the
surf
martin
says
she
very
softly
here
is
a
night
of
such
infinite
quiet
that
i
grow
almost
afraid
of
what
i
demanded
pausing
to
look
down
on
her
where
she
limped
beside
me
and
then
my
teeth
is
it
me
you
fear
ah
no
no
cries
she
slipping
her
hand
within
my
arm
never
never
that
you
foolish
martin
and
here
she
looks
at
me
with
such
a
smile
that
i
must
needs
glance
otherwhere
yet
methought
her
cheeks
showed
pale
in
the
moonlight
why
then
what
amiss
i
questioned
as
we
went
on
again
and
i
very
conscious
of
her
hand
yet
upon
my
arm
i
know
not
she
sighed
is
the
stillness
mayhap
the
loneliness
and
dreadful
solitude
i
feel
as
though
some
danger
threatened
a
storm
belike
says
i
glancing
round
about
us
and
across
the
placid
sea
o
martin
is
hateful
to
be
a
woman
why
should
i
fear
thus
and
no
reason
is
folly
and
here
she
must
pause
to
stamp
her
foot
at
herself
and
yet
i
do
fear
says
she
after
a
while
o
martin
glad
am
i
to
have
man
like
you
beside
me
though
another
man
might
serve
as
well
says
i
of
course
of
course
martin
at
this
i
turned
to
scowl
at
the
placid
sea
again
any
man
says
i
at
last
o
martin
no
how
foolish
under
grow
man
might
be
evil
as
black
bartlemy
i
heard
i
am
much
like
him
in
looks
but
then
you
are
martin
and
he
was
black
bartlemy
after
this
we
were
silent
a
great
while
nor
spoke
again
until
we
had
traversed
the
whole
length
of
deliverance
sands
then
what
manner
of
man
i
demanded
now
at
this
she
turns
to
look
at
me
and
i
saw
their
lips
quiver
to
a
little
smile
that
came
but
to
vanish
again
something
your
sort
martin
but
without
your
gloom
and
evil
tempers
and
one
who
could
laugh
betimes
sir
rupert
quoth
i
he
was
very
gay
and
says
she
yet
suffered
you
to
be
beguiled
and
cast
adrift
to
your
great
peril
but
stayed
to
do
his
share
of
the
fighting
martin
ha
says
i
scowling
is
great
pity
we
may
not
change
places
he
and
i
would
you
change
places
with
him
willingly
martin
aye
i
would
so
at
this
she
whipped
her
hand
from
my
arm
and
turned
to
frown
up
at
me
whiles
i
scowled
sullenly
on
her
why
then
master
conisby
says
she
i
would
you
were
anywhere
but
here
and
know
this
when
you
scowl
so
all
i
know
you
for
the
very
image
of
black
bartlemy
now
as
she
spake
thus
we
were
standing
almost
in
the
very
shadow
of
that
tall
pimento
tree
beneath
which
bartlemy
had
laughed
and
died
and
now
from
this
gloomy
shadow
came
something
that
whirred
by
my
ear
and
was
gone
but
in
that
moment
i
had
swept
my
companion
behind
a
rock
and
with
sword
advanced
leapt
straight
for
the
tree
and
there
in
the
came
on
a
fantastic
shape
and
closed
with
it
in
deadly
grapple
my
rusty
sword
had
snapped
short
at
the
first
onset
yet
twice
i
smote
with
the
broken
blade
while
arm
locked
with
arm
we
writhed
and
twisted
to
and
fro
we
staggered
and
so
out
into
the
moonlight
and
i
saw
my
opponent
for
an
indian
his
long
hair
was
bound
by
a
fillet
that
bore
a
feather
a
feather
cloak
was
about
him
this
much
i
saw
as
we
strove
together
twice
he
broke
my
hold
and
twice
i
grappled
him
and
ever
we
strove
more
fiercely
he
with
his
knife
and
i
with
my
broken
sword
and
once
i
felt
the
searing
pain
of
a
wound
and
now
as
we
swayed
locked
together
thus
i
saw
over
his
bowed
shoulder
my
lady
where
she
crouched
against
a
rock
to
watch
us
and
knowing
myself
hurt
and
my
opponent
very
mighty
and
strong
great
fear
seized
me
run
joan
cried
i
gasping
o
damaris
run
back
never
martin
never
without
you
if
you
must
die
i
come
with
you
mightily
heartened
by
her
voice
i
strove
desperately
to
secure
the
hold
i
sought
but
my
antagonist
was
supple
as
any
eel
moreover
his
skin
was
greased
after
the
manner
of
indian
warriors
but
in
our
struggling
we
had
come
nigh
to
the
rock
where
crouched
my
lady
and
biding
my
time
i
let
go
my
broken
sword
and
seizing
him
by
a
sort
of
collar
he
wore
i
whirled
him
backward
against
the
rock
saw
his
knife
fly
from
his
hold
at
the
impact
felt
his
body
relax
and
grow
limp
and
then
as
my
grasp
loosened
staggered
back
from
a
blow
of
his
knee
and
saw
him
leap
for
the
lagoon
but
i
being
greatly
minded
to
make
an
end
of
him
and
for
good
reasons
set
after
him
and
so
came
running
hard
behind
him
to
the
reef
here
the
way
being
difficult
i
must
needs
slack
my
pace
but
he
surer
footed
ran
fleetly
enough
until
he
was
gotten
to
the
middle
of
the
reef
there
for
a
moment
he
paused
and
looking
back
on
me
where
i
held
on
in
pursuit
i
saw
his
dark
face
darker
for
a
great
splash
of
blood
suddenly
he
raised
one
hand
aloft
shaking
it
to
and
fro
and
so
vanished
down
the
rocks
when
i
came
there
it
was
to
behold
him
paddling
away
in
a
long
piragua
panting
i
stood
to
watch
and
yearning
for
a
bow
or
firelock
until
his
boat
was
hardly
to
be
seen
amid
the
moonlit
ripples
that
furrowed
the
placid
waters
yet
still
i
watched
but
feeling
at
hand
touch
me
turned
to
find
my
lady
beside
me
martin
says
she
looking
up
at
me
o
martin
you
are
wounded
come
let
me
cherish
your
hurts
why
damaris
says
i
yet
panting
with
my
running
you
said
this
to
me
when
i
fought
the
big
village
boy
years
agone
come
martin
you
are
bleeding
nought
to
matter
and
i
let
him
go
to
bring
others
like
enough
i
will
make
my
bow
nay
i
can
walk
but
now
indeed
sea
and
rocks
grew
all
blurred
and
misty
on
my
sight
and
twice
i
must
needs
rest
awhile
ere
we
came
on
deliverance
sands
and
so
homewards
a
weary
journey
whereof
i
remember
nothing
save
that
i
fell
that
i
had
suffered
this
indian
to
escape
so
came
we
to
the
plateau
at
last
her
arm
about
me
and
mine
upon
her
shoulders
and
angered
at
my
weakness
i
strove
to
go
alone
yet
reeled
in
my
gait
like
a
drunken
man
and
so
suffered
her
to
get
me
into
our
cave
as
she
would
being
upon
my
bed
she
brings
the
lamp
and
kneeling
by
me
would
examine
my
hurt
whether
i
would
or
no
and
i
being
weak
off
came
my
shirt
and
then
i
heard
her
give
a
little
gasping
cry
is
it
so
bad
says
i
finding
my
tongue
more
unready
than
usual
nay
is
not
not
your
wound
martin
then
what
your
poor
back
all
these
cruel
scars
o
martin
nought
but
the
lash
they
whipped
us
well
aboard
the
galleass
in
a
while
i
was
aware
of
her
soft
gentle
hands
as
she
bathed
me
with
water
cool
from
the
spring
thereafter
she
made
a
compress
of
moss
and
leaves
and
laying
it
to
my
wound
bound
it
there
as
well
as
she
might
the
which
i
found
very
grateful
and
comforting
this
done
she
sits
close
beside
me
to
hush
and
soothe
me
to
sleep
as
i
had
been
a
sick
child
and
i
lying
sleep
and
wake
knew
i
might
not
rest
until
i
told
her
what
i
had
in
mind
damaris
says
i
this
night
i
lied
to
you
i
would
not
have
another
man
in
my
place
now
or
ever
and
so
sank
to
sleep
chapter
xxx
of
my
sick
humours
next
day
i
awoke
early
and
my
wound
very
painful
and
troublesome
this
notwithstanding
i
presently
got
me
out
into
the
early
sunshine
and
to
my
wonder
found
the
fire
already
lighted
and
no
sign
of
my
companion
hereupon
i
fell
to
shouting
and
hallooing
but
getting
no
answer
sat
me
down
mighty
doleful
and
seeing
her
stool
where
it
stood
straddled
on
its
three
legs
i
cursed
it
for
its
unsightliness
and
turned
my
back
on
it
and
now
crouched
in
the
sunlight
i
grew
mightily
sorry
for
myself
thus
solitary
and
deserted
and
the
hurt
in
my
shoulder
all
on
fire
and
in
a
little
my
gave
place
to
a
fretful
unease
so
that
i
must
needs
shout
her
name
again
and
again
listening
for
sound
of
her
voice
for
some
rustle
to
tell
me
she
was
nigh
but
heard
only
the
faint
booming
of
the
surf
so
i
arose
and
albeit
i
found
my
legs
mighty
unwilling
came
out
upon
the
plateau
but
look
how
and
where
i
might
saw
only
a
desolation
of
sea
and
beach
whereupon
being
greatly
disquieted
i
set
out
minded
to
seek
her
by
the
time
i
reached
deliverance
the
sun
was
well
up
its
heat
causing
my
wound
to
throb
and
itch
intolerably
and
i
very
fretful
and
peevish
but
as
i
tramped
on
and
no
trace
of
her
i
needs
must
remember
how
i
had
sought
her
hereabouts
when
i
had
thought
her
dead
whereupon
a
great
and
unreasoning
panic
seized
me
and
i
began
to
run
and
then
all
at
once
i
spied
her
she
was
sitting
upon
a
rock
her
head
bowed
wearily
upon
her
hands
and
seeing
how
her
shoulders
heaved
i
knew
she
was
bitterly
therefore
i
stopped
and
glancing
from
her
desolate
figure
round
about
upon
her
desolate
surroundings
knew
this
grim
solitude
for
the
reason
of
her
tears
at
this
thought
a
wave
of
hot
anger
swept
over
me
and
a
rage
that
like
my
panic
reasoned
not
as
clenching
my
fists
i
strode
on
suddenly
she
looked
up
and
seeing
me
rose
at
once
and
lifting
the
great
limped
wearily
towards
me
with
this
borne
before
her
ha
says
i
viewing
her
cheeks
as
she
came
must
ye
weep
madam
must
ye
weep
may
i
not
weep
martin
says
she
head
pitifully
come
let
us
go
back
you
look
very
pale
was
wrong
of
you
to
come
so
far
here
is
our
breakfast
is
the
best
i
can
find
and
she
showed
me
a
few
poor
shellfish
give
me
the
says
i
indeed
i
can
bear
it
very
easily
martin
and
you
so
white
and
haggard
your
wound
is
troubling
you
come
let
me
bathe
it
give
me
the
no

be
wise
and
let
us
will
you
gainsay
me
d
defy
me
o
martin
no
but
you
are
so
weak
weak
am
i
so
and
stooping
i
caught
her
up
in
my
arms
upsetting
the
and
spilling
the
result
of
her
labours
so
with
her
crushed
to
me
i
turned
and
set
off
along
the
beach
and
she
lying
thus
helpless
must
needs
fall
to
weeping
again
and
i
in
my
selfish
and
blind
folly
to
plaguing
the
sweet
soul
therewith
as
england
is
far
away
my
lady
joan
here
be
no
courtly
swains
no
perfumed
mincing
lovers
to
sigh
and
bow
and
languish
for
you
here
is
solitude
lady
desolation
hath
you
fast
and
is
not
like
to
let
you
go
here
mayhap
shall
you
live
and
die
an
ill
place
this
and
like
nature
strong
and
cruel
an
ill
place
and
an
ill
rogue
for
company
you
named
me
rogue
once
and
rogue
forsooth
you
find
me
england
is
far
away
but
god
is
farther
thus
i
babbled
scowling
down
on
her
as
i
bore
her
on
until
my
breath
came
in
great
gasps
until
the
sweat
poured
from
me
until
i
sank
to
my
knees
and
striving
to
rise
found
i
might
not
and
glaring
wildly
up
saw
we
were
come
bartlemy
cursed
pimento
tree
then
she
loosing
herself
from
my
fainting
arms
bent
down
to
push
the
matted
hair
from
my
eyes
to
support
my
failing
strength
in
tender
arms
and
to
lower
my
heavy
head
to
her
knee
foolish
child
she
murmured
poor
foolish
child
england
is
very
far
i
know
but
this
i
know
also
martin
god
is
all
about
us
and
here
in
our
loneliness
within
these
great
solitudes
doth
walk
beside
us
yet
you
weep
says
i
aye
i
did
martin
because
of
the
loneliness
no
martin
your
lost
friends
no
martin
then
wherefore
o
trouble
not
for
thing
so
small
a
woman
tears
come
easily
they
say
not
yours
joan
yet
you
wept
your
wound
bleeds
afresh
lie
you
there
and
stir
not
till
i
bring
water
to
bathe
it
and
away
she
hastes
and
i
burning
in
a
fever
of
doubt
and
questioning
must
needs
lie
there
and
watch
her
bring
the
to
fill
it
at
the
little
rill
that
bubbled
in
that
rocky
cleft
as
i
have
described
before
while
this
was
i
stared
up
at
the
pimento
tree
and
bethinking
me
of
black
bartlemy
and
the
poor
spanish
lady
and
of
my
hateful
dream
i
felt
sudden
great
shame
for
here
had
i
crushed
my
lady
in
arms
as
cruel
as
his
this
put
me
to
such
remorse
that
i
might
not
lie
still
and
strove
to
rise
up
yet
got
no
further
than
my
knees
and
was
thus
she
found
me
and
now
when
i
would
have
sued
her
forgiveness
for
my
roughness
she
soothed
me
with
gentle
words
though
what
she
spake
i
knew
not
and
gave
me
to
drink
and
so
fell
to
cherishing
my
hurt
until
my
strength
coming
back
somewhat
i
got
to
my
feet
and
suffered
her
to
bring
me
where
she
would
speaking
no
word
since
in
my
fevered
brain
i
was
asking
myself
this
question
why
must
she
weep
now
whether
the
indian
knife
was
poisoned
or
no
i
can
not
say
but
for
two
days
i
lay
direly
sick
and
scarce
able
to
crawl
conscious
only
of
the
soothing
tones
of
her
voice
and
touch
of
her
hands
but
upon
the
third
day
opening
my
eyes
i
found
myself
greatly
better
though
marvellous
weak
and
as
i
stirred
she
was
beside
me
on
her
knees
drink
this
martin
says
she
and
i
obeying
found
it
was
excellent
broth
and
when
i
had
drunk
all
i
closed
my
eyes
mighty
content
and
so
lay
a
while
my
lady
joan
says
i
at
last
wherefore
did
you
weep
o
martin
she
sighed
was
because
that
morning
i
had
sought
so
long
and
found
so
little
to
give
you
and
you
so
sick
here
was
silence
a
while
but
whence
cometh
the
broth
quoth
i
at
last
i
caught
a
young
goat
martin
in
a
noose
of
hide
set
among
the
rocks
and
then
then
i
had
to
kill
it
o
martin
you
caught
and
killed
a
goat
yes
martin
you
had
to
be
fed
but
o
the
poor
thing
surely
said
i
at
last
o
surely
never
had
man
so
brave
a
comrade
as
i
how
may
i
ever
show
you
all
my
gratitude
by
going
to
sleep
martin
your
wound
is
healed
sleep
is
all
you
need
and
sleep
i
did
though
at
that
time
and
for
many
nights
to
come
my
slumber
was
haunted
by
a
fear
that
the
indian
was
back
again
and
others
with
him
all
stealing
upon
us
to
our
torment
and
destruction
but
in
this
night
i
awoke
parched
with
thirst
and
the
night
very
hot
and
with
the
moon
making
pale
glory
all
about
me
so
i
got
to
my
feet
albeit
with
much
ado
being
yet
very
feeble
when
her
voice
reached
me
what
is
it
martin
are
you
thirsty
beyond
enduring
says
i
bide
you
still
she
commanded
and
next
moment
she
flits
into
the
moonlight
with
one
of
our
larger
shells
to
bring
me
water
from
the
rill
near
by
but
seeing
me
on
my
feet
looks
on
me
then
shakes
reproving
head
lie
you
down
says
she
mighty
serious
lie
you
down
nay
i
go
myself
but
she
was
past
me
and
out
of
the
cave
or
ever
i
might
stay
her
but
scarce
had
i
seated
myself
upon
my
bed
than
she
was
back
again
the
shell
brimming
in
her
hands
so
i
drank
eagerly
enough
but
with
my
gaze
on
the
sheen
of
white
rounded
arm
and
dimpled
shoulder
having
emptied
the
shell
i
stooped
to
set
it
by
and
when
i
looked
again
she
had
vanished
into
her
own
small
cave
i
am
glad
you
are
so
greatly
better
martin
says
she
from
the
dark
indeed
i
am
well
again
quoth
i
i
make
my
bow
and
arrows
had
i
done
this
before
the
indian
should
never
have
got
away
think
you
he
will
return
and
with
others
martin
no
says
i
albeit
my
mind
misgave
me
yet
is
best
to
be
prepared
so
i
will
have
a
good
stout
pike
also
in
place
of
my
broken
sword
and
strengthen
our
door
martin
aye
i
will
so
is
a
mighty
stout
door
thank
god
thank
god
says
she
mighty
reverent
and
now
go
to
sleep
martin
so
here
was
silence
wherein
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
the
breakers
afar
and
the
soft
bubbling
of
the
rill
hard
by
and
yet
sleep
i
could
not
and
you
caught
and
killed
a
goat
says
i
nay
martin
is
a
horror
i
would
forget
and
you
did
it
that
i
might
eat
yes
martin
and
now
hush
thee
though
indeed
says
i
in
a
little
thus
much
you
would
have
done
for
any
man
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
martin
unless
he
were
man
like
black
bartlemy
and
close
your
eyes
are
they
shut
yes
says
i
to
thee
comrade
chapter
xxxi
i
try
my
hand
at
pottery
next
morning
having
bathed
me
in
the
pool
i
descended
thence
to
find
breakfast
two
noble
steaks
propped
before
the
fire
on
skewers
stuck
upright
in
the
ground
a
device
methought
very
ingenious
and
told
her
so
the
which
did
seem
to
please
her
mightily
are
you
hungry
martin
is
a
poor
word
for
it
says
i
sniffing
at
the
roasting
steaks
alas
our
poor
is
all
perished
with
the
fire
martin
if
you
could
but
contrive
me
a
pan
with
handles
i
have
found
plenty
of
clay
along
the
river
bank
yonder
here
she
gives
me
my
steak
on
a
piece
of
wood
for
platter
and
i
being
so
must
needs
burn
my
mouth
in
my
eagerness
whereon
she
gravely
reproves
me
as
i
had
been
a
ravenous
boy
yet
laughs
thereafter
to
see
me
eat
with
such
huge
appetite
now
a
bite
of
plantain
and
now
a
slice
of
steak
cut
with
my
knife
as
to
your
pan
with
handles
says
i
my
hunger
appeased
somewhat
i
will
set
about
it
as
soon
as
i
have
made
my
bow
and
arrows
there
is
no
need
of
them
quoth
she
and
rising
away
she
goes
and
presently
comes
back
with
a
goodly
bow
and
quiver
full
of
arrows
lord
love
you
says
i
leaping
up
in
my
eagerness
here
mighty
good
weapon
as
indeed
it
was
being
longer
than
most
indian
bows
and
of
good
power
moreover
it
was
tufted
with
feathers
rare
to
fancy
and
garnished
here
and
there
with
fillets
of
very
artificially
wrought
as
were
also
the
arrows
nine
of
these
there
were
in
a
quiver
of
tanned
leather
adorned
with
featherwork
and
gold
beads
so
that
i
did
not
doubt
but
that
their
late
owner
had
been
of
some
account
among
his
fellows
i
found
them
two
days
ago
martin
but
kept
them
until
you
should
be
well
again
and
this
i
found
too
and
she
showed
me
a
gold
collar
of
twisted
wire
delicately
wrought
all
of
the
which
put
me
in
high
good
humour
and
i
was
minded
to
set
off
there
and
then
to
try
a
shot
at
something
but
she
prevailed
upon
me
to
finish
my
meal
first
the
which
i
did
though
hastily
there
was
a
knife
also
says
i
suddenly
yes
martin
but
i
threw
it
into
the
lagoon
o
folly
says
i
nay
we
have
two
knives
already
and
this
as
i
do
think
was
poisoned
no
matter
was
a
goodly
knife
why
must
you
throw
it
away
because
i
was
so
minded
says
she
mighty
serene
and
regarding
me
with
her
calm
level
gaze
never
scowl
martin
though
indeed
was
goodly
knife
with
handle
all
at
this
i
scowled
the
more
and
she
must
needs
laugh
calling
me
black
bartlemy
whereon
i
turned
my
back
on
her
and
she
fell
to
herself
think
you
these
arrows
are
poisoned
also
says
she
as
i
rose
at
this
i
emptied
them
from
the
quiver
and
though
their
iron
barbs
looked
innocent
enough
i
held
each
in
the
fire
until
i
judged
i
had
rendered
them
harmless
if
poisoned
they
were
indeed
and
now
though
sore
tempted
to
try
my
skill
with
this
good
bow
i
followed
her
down
to
the
to
try
my
hand
at
pottery
though
taking
good
care
to
carry
my
bow
with
me
being
come
to
the
river
i
laid
aside
bow
and
quiver
and
cutting
divers
lumps
of
clay
the
which
seemed
very
proper
to
my
purpose
i
fell
to
kneading
these
lumps
until
i
had
wrought
them
to
a
plastic
consistency
and
so
keeping
my
hands
continually
moistened
i
began
to
mould
and
shape
a
pot
to
her
directions
and
now
since
i
was
about
it
i
determined
to
have
as
many
as
need
be
and
of
different
sizes
my
first
was
a
great
thing
and
my
second
little
better
but
as
i
progressed
i
grew
more
skilful
so
that
after
some
while
i
had
six
pots
of
varying
size
and
shape
and
each
with
handles
and
though
ill
things
to
look
at
my
lady
found
them
all
she
desired
surely
they
are
very
clumsy
says
i
viewing
them
doubtfully
but
very
strong
martin
and
very
ponderous
but
they
have
handles
martin
and
very
is
no
matter
so
long
as
they
will
hold
water
martin
hereupon
heartened
by
her
encouragement
i
tried
my
hand
at
a
set
of
dishes
platters
and
the
like
for
as
i
grew
more
expert
at
the
art
my
interest
increased
so
i
laboured
all
the
morning
working
a
tree
upon
the
and
my
pots
set
out
to
dry
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
all
of
a
row
and
i
in
my
heart
not
a
little
proud
of
them
but
turning
to
look
at
them
after
some
while
i
saw
divers
of
them
beginning
to
crack
and
gape
here
and
there
with
the
sun
heat
whereon
my
vain
pride
gave
place
to
sudden
petulant
anger
and
leaping
up
i
demolished
them
one
and
all
with
a
couple
of
savage
kicks
o
martin
cries
my
lady
desponding
is
all
your
labour
wasted
are
you
done
no
says
i
clenching
my
teeth
i
begin
now
and
down
i
sat
to
my
again
but
this
time
i
worked
it
more
thoroughly
and
so
began
to
mould
my
pots
and
pipkins
over
again
and
she
aiding
me
as
well
as
she
might
this
time
the
thing
came
easier
at
the
which
my
companion
did
admire
and
very
full
of
encouragement
as
the
vessels
took
shape
under
my
hands
come
martin
says
she
at
last
is
no
matter
quoth
i
will
you
not
eat
no
says
i
mighty
determined
here
sit
i
nor
will
i
go
eat
till
i
can
contrive
you
a
pot
worthy
the
name
and
i
bent
to
my
work
again
but
missing
her
from
beside
me
turned
to
see
her
seated
upon
the
grassy
bank
and
with
two
roasted
steaks
set
out
upon
two
great
green
leaves
a
delectable
sight
pray
lend
me
your
knife
martin
what
have
you
brought
dinner
hither
says
i
to
be
sure
martin
why
then
says
i
and
laving
the
clay
from
my
hands
came
beside
her
and
using
our
knife
alternately
a
very
pleasant
meal
we
made
of
it
all
that
afternoon
i
wrought
at
our
pots
until
i
had
made
a
dozen
or
so
of
all
sizes
and
each
and
every
furnished
with
one
or
more
handles
and
though
i
scowled
at
a
crack
here
and
there
they
looked
none
the
less
serviceable
on
the
whole
and
hardening
apace
and
now
comrade
quoth
i
rising
now
we
will
fire
them
so
having
collected
wood
sufficient
i
reached
for
my
biggest
pot
the
which
being
made
first
was
the
and
taking
it
up
with
infinite
care
off
tumbled
the
handles
at
this
i
was
minded
to
dash
the
thing
to
pieces
but
her
touch
restrained
me
and
i
set
it
down
staring
at
it
mighty
discomfited
and
downcast
whereat
she
laughs
right
merrily
o
martin
says
she
never
gloom
so
is
an
excellent
pot
even
without
handles
indeed
i
do
prefer
it
so
no
says
i
handles
you
wanted
and
handles
you
shall
have
so
taking
a
stick
that
lay
handy
i
sharpened
it
to
a
point
and
therewith
bored
me
two
holes
beneath
the
lip
of
the
pot
and
other
two
opposite
this
pot
shall
have
iron
handle
says
i
unless
it
perish
in
the
fire
then
setting
the
pots
as
close
as
might
be
i
covered
them
with
brushwood
and
thereupon
and
with
infinite
caution
builded
a
fire
and
presently
had
it
now
i
would
have
stayed
to
tend
the
fire
but
my
companion
showed
me
the
sun
already
low
vowed
i
had
done
enough
that
i
was
tired
etc
so
having
set
upon
the
fire
wood
enough
to
burn
good
time
i
turned
away
and
found
myself
weary
even
as
she
said
says
i
as
we
sat
side
by
side
after
supper
is
an
excellent
wholesome
diet
and
as
you
cook
it
delicious
is
kind
of
you
to
say
so
martin
but
we
have
had
it
says
i
we
have
had
it
boiled
and
baked
and
roast
and
stewed
and
broiled
across
your
iron
bolts
martin
and
yet
is
always
and
i
do
yearn
for
a
change
and
so
do
you
lord
says
i
you
do
read
my
very
thoughts
sometimes
is
that
so
wonderful
martin
why
a
man
thoughts
are
but
thoughts
says
i
watching
where
she
braided
a
long
tress
of
her
hair
some
men
thoughts
are
so
easily
read
says
she
are
mine
sometimes
martin
now
at
this
i
blenched
and
well
i
might
and
she
smiled
down
at
the
long
tress
of
hair
she
was
braiding
and
then
glances
at
me
mighty
demure
quoth
she
but
only
sometimes
martin
now
for
instance
you
are
wondering
why
of
late
i
have
taken
to
wearing
my
hair
twisted
round
my
head
and
pinned
with
these
two
small
pieces
of
wood
in
fashion
so
unsightly
aye
truly
says
i
wondering
indeed
and
so
i
was
though
i
do
not
think
it
unsightly
i
wear
it
so
martin
first
because
my
hairpins
are
yet
to
make
and
second
because
i
would
not
have
you
find
my
hairs
in
your
baked
goat
boiled
goat
roast
fried
or
stewed
goat
and
speaking
of
goat
brings
us
back
where
we
began
and
we
began
yearning
for
a
change
of
food
as
to
that
says
i
taking
her
hairpin
from
my
pocket
and
drawing
my
knife
the
lagoon
is
full
of
fish
had
i
but
a
hook
or
a
net
martin
how
should
we
contrive
our
net
in
the
woods
all
about
us
do
grow
vines
very
strong
and
pliable
would
these
serve
think
you
ha
an
excellent
thought
says
i
we
will
attempt
it
as
to
i
might
contrive
them
out
of
my
nails
hammered
small
though
i
fear
they
be
but
clumsy
had
i
but
a
good
stout
pin
i
have
two
martin
here
in
my
show
me
stooping
she
slipped
off
one
of
her
shoes
and
gave
it
to
me
and
turning
it
over
in
my
hand
i
saw
the
poor
little
thing
all
cut
and
torn
and
in
woeful
estate
i
must
contrive
you
other
shoes
and
soon
says
i
can
you
make
shoes
martin
i
tell
you
this
o
martin
be
wonderful
if
you
could
and
a
great
comfort
to
me
why
then
you
shall
have
them
though
unlovely
things
they
be
i
fear
no
matter
so
long
as
they
keep
out
sharp
stones
and
briars
martin
your
foot
is
wonderfully
small
says
i
studying
her
shoe
is
it
martin
why
is
a
very
ordinary
foot
i
think
and
the
pins
are
behind
the
buckles
sure
enough
i
found
these
silver
buckles
furnished
each
with
a
good
stout
pin
to
my
design
so
breaking
them
from
the
buckles
i
had
soon
bent
them
into
hooks
and
with
the
back
of
my
knife
and
a
stone
i
shaped
each
with
a
small
ring
whereby
i
might
secure
them
to
my
line
and
though
they
had
no
barbs
i
thought
they
might
catch
any
fish
were
i
quick
enough
how
shall
you
do
for
a
line
martin
i
shall
take
the
gut
of
one
of
our
goats
and
worsted
unravelled
from
my
stocking
will
worsted
be
strong
enough
i
shall
make
it
fourfold
nay
i
will
plait
it
into
a
line
for
you
good
quoth
i
and
whipping
off
one
of
my
stockings
i
unravelled
therefrom
sufficient
of
the
worsted
but
what
shall
you
do
for
stockings
says
she
while
this
was
i
will
make
me
leggings
of
so
she
took
the
worsted
and
now
sitting
in
a
patch
of
radiant
moonlight
fell
to
work
she
weaving
our
with
fingers
very
quick
and
dexterous
and
i
carving
away
at
the
pin
for
her
hair
how
old
are
you
martin
says
she
suddenly
and
i
shall
be
i
judged
you
older
do
i
look
it
martin
yes
no
no
meaning
what
martin
you
do
seem
older
being
no
silly
maid
but
of
a
constant
mind
and
one
to
endure
hardship
also
you
are
very
brave
in
peril
very
courageous
and
moreover
you
are
wise
do
you
think
me
all
this
says
she
softly
and
wherefore
i
have
never
heard
you
complain
yet
save
of
me
and
i
have
never
seen
you
afraid
moreover
you
caught
a
goat
and
killed
it
you
are
like
to
make
me
vain
of
my
so
many
virtues
martin
laughs
she
yet
her
laugh
was
very
soft
and
her
eyes
kind
when
she
looked
at
me
this
hairpin
shall
be
my
birthday
gift
to
you
says
i
and
surely
none
like
to
it
in
the
whole
world
martin
after
this
we
worked
a
great
while
speaking
no
word
but
presently
she
shows
me
my
very
neatly
plaited
and
a
good
five
feet
long
the
which
did
please
me
mightily
and
so
i
told
her
heigho
says
she
leaning
back
against
the
rock
our
days
grow
ever
more
busy
and
will
do
quoth
i
here
is
strange
rude
life
for
you
days
of
hardship
and
labour
unceasing
your
hands
shall
grow
all
hard
and
rough
and
yourself
sick
with
longing
to
be
hence
alas
poor
me
she
sighed
why
be
no
wonder
if
you
grieve
for
england
and
ease
says
i
be
but
natural
o
very
martin
for
here
are
you
i
went
on
beginning
to
scowl
up
at
the
waning
moon
here
are
you
bred
up
to
soft
and
silken
comfort
very
dainty
and
delicate
and
belike
with
lovers
courtly
gallants
full
up
of
fine
phrases
and
eager
for
your
service
well
martin
instead
of
the
which
you
have
this
island
an
earthly
paradise
says
she
and
myself
a
foolish
being
and
gloomy
says
she
one
that
loveth
to
be
woeful
and
having
nought
to
grieve
him
for
the
moment
must
needs
seek
somewhat
so
will
i
to
bed
ere
he
find
it
look
now
quoth
i
as
she
rose
in
losing
the
world
you
do
lose
everything
and
you
also
martin
nay
says
i
in
losing
the
world
of
yesterday
i
may
find
more
than
ever
i
possessed
meaning
you
are
content
martin
is
anyone
ever
content
in
this
world
well
i
might
be
says
she
slowly
but
you
i
do
fear
you
will
never
know
true
content
it
is
not
in
you
i
think
and
off
she
goes
to
bed
leaving
me
very
full
of
thought
howbeit
the
moon
being
very
bright
though
on
the
wane
i
stayed
there
until
i
had
finished
her
hairpin
of
the
which
i
give
here
a
cut
viz
sketch
of
a
hairpin
chapter
xxxii
tells
how
i
found
a
secret
cave
next
morning
i
was
up
mighty
early
and
away
to
the
little
valley
first
to
view
my
pots
and
then
to
pick
some
flowers
for
her
birthday
remembering
her
great
love
for
such
toys
coming
to
the
ashes
of
the
fire
i
must
needs
fall
most
vilely
like
the
ill
fellow
i
was
and
to
swearing
many
great
and
vain
oaths
and
it
her
birthday
for
here
were
my
pots
what
the
fire
had
left
of
them
all
swollen
and
bulged
with
the
heat
warped
and
misshapen
beyond
imagining
so
i
stood
plucking
my
beard
and
cursing
them
severally
and
all
together
and
fetched
the
nearest
a
kick
that
nigh
broke
my
toe
and
set
the
pot
leaping
and
bounding
a
couple
of
yards
but
all
unbroken
going
to
it
i
took
it
up
and
found
it
not
so
much
as
scratched
and
hard
as
any
stone
this
comforted
me
somewhat
and
made
me
to
regret
my
ill
language
more
especially
having
regard
to
this
day
being
as
it
were
a
day
apart
and
now
as
i
went
on
crossing
the
stream
at
a
place
where
were
set
there
by
other
hands
than
mine
as
i
went
i
say
i
must
needs
think
what
a
surly
fellow
i
was
contrasting
the
gross
man
i
was
become
with
the
gentle
lad
i
had
been
well
but
thinks
i
excusing
myself
the
plantations
and
a
be
a
school
where
a
man
is
apt
to
learn
nought
but
evil
and
brutality
my
wrongs
have
made
me
what
i
am
but
again
thinks
i
blaming
myself
wrong
and
hardship
cruelty
and
suffering
do
not
debase
all
men
as
witness
the
brave
frenchman
that
was
whipped
to
death
beside
me
in
the
galleass
wrong
and
suffering
either
lift
a
man
to
greatness
or
debase
him
to
the
very
brute
she
had
said
as
much
to
me
once
and
she
was
right
thinks
i
for
the
frenchman
had
died
the
noble
gentleman
he
was
born
whiles
i
as
as
he
and
suffering
no
greater
wrong
than
he
according
to
his
own
account
i
had
sullied
myself
with
all
the
vileness
and
filth
of
slavedom
had
fought
and
rioted
with
the
worst
of
them
and
now
remembering
the
shame
of
it
all
i
sat
me
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
fell
to
gloomy
and
sad
reflection
grieving
sorely
over
things
long
past
and
forgotten
until
now
and
very
full
of
remorse
and
scorn
of
myself
howbeit
thinks
i
if
rogue
and
brute
i
am
which
is
beyond
all
doubt
i
will
keep
such
for
my
own
kind
and
she
shall
know
nought
of
it
and
here
getting
upon
my
knees
i
took
a
great
and
solemn
oath
to
this
effect
never
by
look
or
word
or
gesture
to
give
her
cause
for
shame
or
fear
so
long
as
we
should
abide
together
in
this
solitude
so
aid
me
god
this
done
i
arose
from
my
knees
and
betook
me
to
culling
flowers
great
silver
lilies
and
others
of
divers
hues
being
minded
to
lay
them
on
the
threshold
of
her
door
to
greet
her
when
she
should
arise
with
these
in
my
arms
i
recrossed
the
brook
and
stepping
out
from
a
thicket
came
full
upon
her
ere
she
was
aware
and
seeing
her
so
suddenly
i
stood
like
any
fool
my
poor
flowers
hidden
behind
me
she
had
taken
up
one
of
my
misshapen
pots
and
was
patting
it
softly
as
she
viewed
it
and
a
little
smile
on
her
red
lips
all
at
once
she
turned
and
spying
me
came
towards
me
all
smiling
fresh
and
radiant
as
the
morning
o
martin
says
she
turning
the
pot
this
way
and
that
o
martin
wonderful
is
an
abomination
quoth
i
and
hold
water
is
like
an
ill
dream
says
i
and
so
strong
martin
true
is
the
only
merit
the
things
possess
they
are
like
stone
watch
now
and
here
to
prove
my
words
i
let
one
drop
though
indeed
i
chose
a
soft
place
for
it
and
they
will
be
so
easy
to
carry
with
these
handles
and
why
what
have
you
there
saying
which
she
sets
down
the
pot
gently
as
it
had
been
an
and
comes
to
me
whereupon
i
showed
her
my
posy
and
i
more
than
ever
i
chanced
to
see
them
growing
says
i
and
thought
your
birthday
they
might
pleasure
you
a
little
mayhap
please
me
says
she
taking
them
please
me
o
the
dear
beautiful
things
i
love
them
and
she
buries
her
face
among
them
was
kind
of
you
to
bring
them
for
me
martin
says
she
her
face
hidden
in
the
flowers
indeed
you
are
very
good
to
me
after
all
you
are
that
same
dear
martin
i
knew
long
ago
that
boy
who
used
to
brandish
his
rusty
sword
and
vow
he
suffer
no
evil
to
come
near
me
and
yearned
for
ogres
and
dragons
to
fight
and
slay
on
my
behalf
and
one
day
you
caught
a
boy
pulling
my
hair
it
was
very
long
hair
even
then
says
i
and
he
made
your
lip
bleed
martin
and
i
hit
him
on
the
nose
says
i
and
he
ran
away
martin
and
you
bathed
my
lip
in
the
pool
and
afterwards
you
you
yes
i
did
martin
though
is
a
long
time
to
remember
i
shall
never
forget
says
i
shall
you
here
she
buries
her
face
in
her
flowers
again
as
to
the
pots
martin
there
are
four
quite
unbroken
will
you
help
me
bear
them
to
our
refuge
breakfast
will
be
ready
breakfast
is
a
sweet
word
quoth
i
and
as
to
these
things
if
you
will
have
them
well
and
good
and
thus
she
with
her
flowers
and
i
with
the
gallipots
we
came
to
our
habitation
what
do
we
work
at
she
questioned
as
we
rose
from
our
morning
meal
i
make
you
a
pair
of
shoes
how
may
i
aid
you
martin
in
a
thousand
ways
says
i
and
i
plucked
a
great
leaf
that
grew
adjacent
first
sit
you
down
and
now
give
me
your
foot
so
kneeling
before
her
i
traced
out
the
shape
of
her
foot
upon
the
leaf
and
got
no
further
for
a
while
so
that
presently
she
goes
about
her
household
duties
leaving
me
staring
at
my
leaf
and
scratching
my
head
puzzling
out
how
i
must
cut
and
shape
my
all
that
morning
i
sat
scheming
and
studying
how
best
i
might
achieve
my
purpose
and
the
end
of
it
was
this
sketch
of
a
leaf
cut
to
shape
this
shape
i
cut
from
the
leaf
and
with
it
went
to
find
my
lady
then
she
sitting
upon
the
stool
i
took
off
one
of
her
shoes
and
she
all
laughing
wonderment
and
fitting
this
pattern
to
her
foot
found
it
well
enough
for
shape
though
something
too
large
i
now
took
the
and
laying
it
on
the
table
cut
therefrom
a
piece
to
my
pattern
then
with
one
of
my
nails
ground
to
a
sharp
point
like
a
cobbler
awl
i
pierced
it
with
holes
and
sewed
it
together
with
gut
in
this
fashion
four
sketches
of
shaped
hide
showing
stages
of
manufacture
this
is
quickly
over
in
the
telling
but
it
was
long
so
that
having
wrought
steadily
all
day
night
was
at
hand
ere
her
shoes
were
completed
with
two
thicknesses
of
hide
for
soles
and
all
sewed
mighty
secure
now
though
they
were
not
things
of
beauty
as
may
plainly
be
seen
from
my
drawing
herewith
yet
once
i
had
laced
them
snug
upon
her
feet
they
shaping
and
moulding
themselves
to
her
slender
ankles
and
dainty
feet
were
none
so
after
all
and
now
she
walking
to
and
fro
in
them
must
needs
admire
at
their
construction
and
the
comfort
of
them
and
very
lavish
in
her
praise
of
them
and
me
the
which
did
pleasure
me
mightily
though
i
took
pains
to
hide
it
why
martin
says
she
thrusting
out
a
foot
and
wagging
it
to
and
fro
very
taking
to
behold
i
vow
our
cobbler
surpasseth
our
carpenter
dian
buskins
were
no
better
nay
not
so
good
judging
by
pictures
i
have
seen
they
will
at
least
keep
out
any
thorns
says
i
though
as
to
looks
they
look
what
they
are
martin
the
shoes
of
a
huntress
you
will
find
her
very
swift
and
when
her
bruises
are
quite
gone
i
glad
they
please
you
says
i
yet
upon
my
knees
and
stooping
to
view
them
her
petticoat
though
now
i
see
i
might
better
them
by
trimming
and
shaping
them
here
and
there
no
no
martin
leave
well
alone
but
now
and
all
at
once
i
started
to
feel
a
great
splash
of
rain
upon
my
cheek
and
glancing
up
saw
the
sky
all
overcast
while
seaward
the
whole
horizon
was
very
black
and
ominous
great
masses
of
writhing
vapour
and
these
threatening
clouds
lit
ever
and
anon
by
a
reddish
glow
and
pierced
by
vivid
lightning
flashes
all
of
which
took
us
mightily
by
surprise
we
having
been
too
intent
upon
these
new
buskins
to
heed
aught
else
yonder
is
storm
and
tempest
says
i
see
how
it
sweeps
towards
us
and
i
pointed
where
far
across
the
dark
sea
a
line
of
foam
marked
the
oncoming
fury
of
the
wind
and
presently
we
heard
it
a
faint
hum
growing
ever
louder
and
fiercer
o
martin
see
yonder
and
she
pointed
to
the
onrushing
of
the
foaming
waters
is
very
awful
but
very
grand
let
us
go
in
says
i
catching
up
my
tools
come
soon
will
be
roaring
havoc
all
about
us
nay
let
us
stay
awhile
and
watch
as
she
spoke
it
seemed
as
the
sea
gathered
itself
into
one
great
and
mighty
wave
a
huge
wall
of
foaming
waters
that
rolled
onward
hissing
and
roaring
as
it
would
the
very
island
beneath
it
on
it
rushed
swelling
ever
higher
and
so
burst
in
thunder
upon
the
barrier
reef
filling
the
air
with
whirling
foam
and
then
then
came
the
wind
a
screaming
howling
vicious
titan
that
hurled
us
flat
and
pinned
me
breathless
and
scarce
able
to
move
howbeit
i
crawled
where
she
crouched
somewhat
sheltered
by
a
rock
and
clasping
her
within
my
arm
lay
there
nor
dared
to
stir
until
the
mad
fury
of
the
wind
abated
somewhat
then
side
by
side
on
hands
and
knees
we
gained
our
rocky
fastness
and
closing
the
door
which
was
screened
from
the
direct
force
of
the
tempest
i
barred
it
with
the
beam
i
had
made
for
the
purpose
and
stood
staring
at
my
companion
and
she
on
me
while
all
the
world
about
us
roared
and
clamoured
loud
and
louder
until
it
seemed
here
was
to
be
an
end
of
all
things
and
now
suddenly
came
darkness
and
in
this
darkness
her
hand
found
mine
and
nestled
there
thus
we
remained
a
great
while
hearkening
to
the
awful
booming
of
this
rushing
mighty
wind
a
sound
indescribable
in
itself
yet
one
to
shake
the
very
soul
in
a
while
the
tumult
subsiding
a
little
we
might
distinguish
other
sounds
as
the
rolling
of
thunder
the
rending
crash
of
falling
trees
hard
by
and
the
roar
of
mighty
waters
and
presently
her
voice
came
to
me
god
pity
all
poor
mariners
martin
amen
says
i
and
needs
must
think
of
adam
and
godby
and
wonder
where
they
might
be
is
very
dark
shall
we
not
have
a
light
she
questioned
if
i
can
find
our
lamp
says
i
groping
about
for
it
here
is
a
candle
a
candle
says
i
and
where
should
we
find
a
candle
we
have
three
martin
i
made
them
with
tallow
from
our
goat
though
they
are
poor
things
i
fear
taking
out
my
i
very
soon
had
these
candles
burning
and
though
they
smoked
somewhat
a
very
excellent
light
we
thought
them
and
now
for
supper
says
she
beginning
to
bustle
about
our
meat
is
in
the
larder
martin
now
this
larder
was
our
third
and
smallest
cave
and
going
therein
i
was
immediately
struck
by
the
coldness
of
it
moreover
the
flame
of
the
candle
i
bore
flickered
as
in
a
draught
of
air
insomuch
that
forgetting
the
meat
i
began
searching
high
and
low
looking
for
some
crack
or
crevice
whence
this
draught
issued
yet
found
none
this
set
me
to
wondering
for
here
was
the
cave
some
ten
feet
by
twelve
or
more
and
set
deep
within
the
living
rock
the
walls
smoothed
off
here
and
there
as
by
hand
but
with
never
a
crack
or
fissure
in
roof
or
walls
so
far
as
i
might
discover
yet
was
i
conscious
of
this
cold
breath
of
air
so
that
my
puzzlement
grew
the
greater
presently
as
i
stood
thus
staring
about
to
me
comes
my
lady
good
lack
martin
says
she
if
we
sup
on
goat
we
must
eat
it
raw
for
we
have
no
fire
fire
says
i
hum
smoke
would
do
it
is
an
excellent
thought
do
what
martin
look
at
the
and
hark
and
now
the
booming
of
the
wind
dying
down
somewhat
we
heard
a
strange
and
dismal
wailing
and
therewith
a
sound
of
water
afar
o
martin
she
whispered
clasping
her
hands
and
coming
nearer
to
me
what
is
it
nought
to
fear
comrade
but
somewhere
in
this
larder
of
ours
is
an
opening
or
fissure
the
question
is
where
and
this
i
go
to
find
out
aye
but
how
she
questioned
coming
nearer
yet
for
now
the
wailing
had
sunk
to
a
groan
and
this
gave
place
to
a
bubbling
gasp
mighty
unpleasant
to
hear
with
smoke
says
i
setting
the
candle
in
a
niche
of
rock
i
will
light
a
fire
here
but
we
have
no
fuel
martin
there
is
plenty
in
my
bed
but
how
will
you
sleep
and
no
bed
well
enough
as
i
have
done
many
a
time
and
oft
but
o
martin
make
such
dire
mess
and
this
our
larder
no
matter
i
clean
it
up
howbeit
i
must
learn
whence
cometh
this
air
besides
the
fire
shall
cook
our
supper
and
moreover
but
here
i
checked
speaking
all
at
once
for
above
the
dismal
groans
and
wailing
i
had
heard
a
sudden
fierce
whispering
o
martin
o
martin
sighed
my
companion
we
are
not
alone
somewhere
there
are
people
whispering
did
you
hear
martin
o
did
you
hear
and
i
felt
her
all
of
where
she
leaned
against
me
is
gone
now
says
i
speaking
under
my
breath
but
was
there
martin
a
hateful
whispering
aye
i
heard
it
says
i
fierce
and
loud
and
i
find
out
who
or
what
who
or
what
hissed
a
soft
voice
hereupon
i
sheathed
the
knife
i
had
drawn
and
laughed
and
immediately
there
came
another
laugh
though
very
soft
ahoy
i
shouted
and
presently
back
came
the
answer
ahoy
and
then
again
though
much
fainter
ahoy
is
nought
but
an
echo
says
i
laughing
yet
mighty
relieved
all
the
same
thank
god
says
she
faintly
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
my
arm
why
comrade
how
now
says
i
and
for
a
moment
her
soft
cheek
rested
against
my
leathern
jerkin
o
martin
says
she
sighing
i
do
fear
me
i
a
monstrous
craven
sometimes
forgive
me
forgive
you
says
i
and
looking
down
on
her
bowed
head
feeling
her
thus
all
against
me
i
fell
forgive
you
nay
where
here
was
an
unchancy
thing
is
small
wonder
no
wonder
you
should
grow
affrighted
and
tremble
a
little
you
are
trembling
also
says
she
her
voice
muffled
against
me
am
i
yes
martin
were
you
afraid
likewise
no
yes
says
i
and
feeling
her
stir
in
my
hold
i
loosed
her
and
now
bringing
fern
and
bracken
from
my
bed
i
kindled
a
fire
and
damping
this
a
little
made
a
smoke
the
which
rising
to
a
certain
height
blew
back
upon
us
but
always
from
the
one
direction
and
peering
up
thither
i
judged
here
must
be
a
space
the
roof
and
the
face
of
the
rock
though
marvellous
from
all
observation
hereupon
the
place
being
full
of
smoke
i
must
needs
stamp
out
the
fire
lest
we
stifle
yet
i
had
discovered
what
i
sought
so
whilst
my
companion
busied
herself
about
supper
i
dragged
our
table
from
the
outer
cave
setting
it
in
a
certain
corner
and
mounted
thereon
reached
up
and
grasped
a
ledge
of
rock
by
which
i
drew
myself
up
and
found
i
was
in
a
narrow
opening
or
tunnel
and
so
low
that
i
must
creep
on
hands
and
knees
will
you
have
a
candle
martin
and
there
was
my
lady
standing
below
me
on
the
table
all
so
i
took
the
candle
and
creeping
through
this
narrow
passage
suddenly
found
myself
in
another
cavern
very
spacious
and
lofty
and
now
standing
in
this
place
i
stared
about
me
very
full
of
wonder
as
well
i
might
be
for
i
saw
this
before
me
a
narrow
door
very
stout
and
pierced
with
a
loophole
and
beyond
this
a
rocky
passage
that
led
steeply
down
on
my
right
hand
in
a
corner
a
rough
bed
with
a
bundle
of
and
sheets
that
looked
like
sailcloth
on
my
left
a
table
and
armchair
like
the
bed
and
above
these
a
row
of
shelves
against
the
rocky
wall
whereon
stood
three
pipkins
an
iron
a
candlestick
and
an
inkhorn
with
pen
in
it
lastly
in
a
corner
close
beside
the
bed
i
spied
a
firelock
with
bandoliers
complete
i
was
about
to
reach
this
and
very
joyously
when
my
voice
arrested
me
martin
are
you
there
are
you
safe
indeed
says
i
and
damaris
i
have
found
you
treasure
beyond
price
o
martin
is
it
bartlemy
treasure
the
jewels
better
than
that
a
thousand
times
i
have
found
you
a
real
o
wonderful
show
me
nay
let
me
see
for
myself
come
and
aid
me
up
martin
setting
down
my
candle
i
crawled
back
where
she
stood
all
eager
impatience
and
clasping
her
hands
in
mine
drew
her
up
and
on
hands
and
knees
brought
her
into
the
cave
here
a
goodly
place
comrade
says
i
yes
martin
with
a
ladder
to
come
and
go
by
this
should
make
you
a
noble
bedchamber
never
says
she
o
never
and
wherefore
not
first
because
i
like
my
little
cave
best
and
second
because
this
is
too
much
like
a
dungeon
and
third
because
i
like
it
not
and
hark
and
indeed
as
we
spoke
the
echoes
hissed
and
whispered
all
about
us
why
is
airy
and
very
dry
and
very
dark
by
day
martin
true
enough
still
is
a
wondrous
place
o
very
martin
only
i
like
it
not
at
all
why
then
the
bed
the
bed
should
serve
you
handsomely
no
says
she
mighty
vehement
you
shall
make
me
a
better
an
you
will
or
i
will
do
with
my
bed
of
fern
well
then
this
pot
here
is
noble
iron
pot
for
you
at
least
why
yes
says
she
smiling
to
see
me
all
chapfallen
is
indeed
a
very
good
pot
let
us
bring
it
away
with
us
though
indeed
i
could
do
very
well
without
it
lord
says
i
gloomily
here
have
i
found
you
all
these
goodly
things
not
to
mention
chair
and
table
thinking
to
please
you
and
instead
i
know
martin
forgive
me
but
i
love
not
the
place
nor
anything
in
it
i
am
very
foolish
belike
but
so
it
is
and
here
she
must
needs
shiver
as
to
these
things
the
bed
the
chair
and
table
and
the
shelves
yonder
why
you
can
contrive
better
in
time
martin
and
by
your
thought
and
labour
they
will
be
doubly
ours
made
by
you
for
our
two
selves
and
used
by
none
but
us
true
says
i
greatly
mollified
but
this
pot
now
i
can
never
make
you
so
brave
a
pot
as
this
why
very
well
martin
says
she
smiling
at
my
earnestness
bring
it
and
let
us
begone
so
i
reached
down
the
pot
and
espied
therein
a
pistol
whipping
it
out
i
blew
off
the
dust
and
saw
primed
and
loaded
and
with
flint
in
place
albeit
very
rusty
i
was
yet
staring
at
this
when
my
lady
gives
a
little
soft
cry
of
pleasure
and
comes
to
me
with
somewhat
hidden
behind
her
martin
says
she
is
a
good
place
after
all
for
see
see
what
it
hath
given
you
and
she
shewed
me
that
which
i
had
yawned
for
so
bitterly
viz
a
good
stout
saw
tossing
aside
the
pistol
i
took
it
eagerly
enough
and
though
it
was
rusty
a
very
serviceable
tool
i
found
it
to
be
ha
comrade
says
i
now
shall
you
have
a
chair
with
arms
a
cupboard
and
a
bed
fit
to
lie
on
here
is
all
the
furniture
you
may
want
and
now
says
she
let
us
begone
if
you
would
have
your
supper
martin
so
i
followed
her
through
the
little
tunnel
and
having
lowered
her
on
to
the
table
gave
her
the
pot
and
then
albeit
she
was
mighty
unwilling
turned
back
minded
to
bring
away
the
firelock
and
pistol
and
any
such
odds
and
ends
as
might
serve
me
reaching
the
cave
i
heard
again
the
dismal
groans
and
wailing
but
much
louder
than
before
and
coming
to
the
door
saw
it
opened
on
a
steep
declivity
of
rock
wherein
were
rough
steps
or
rather
notches
that
yet
gave
good
foothold
so
i
began
to
descend
this
narrow
way
my
candle
before
me
and
taking
vast
heed
to
my
feet
but
as
i
got
lower
the
rock
grew
moist
and
slimy
so
that
i
was
to
turn
back
but
having
come
this
far
determined
to
see
where
it
might
bring
me
for
now
from
the
glooms
below
i
could
hear
the
soft
lapping
of
water
then
all
at
once
i
stopped
and
stood
shivering
as
well
i
might
for
immediately
beneath
me
i
saw
a
narrow
ledge
of
rock
and
beyond
this
a
pit
black
and
noisome
and
full
of
sluggish
water
for
a
long
while
as
it
seemed
i
stared
down
into
this
water
scarce
daring
to
move
lest
i
plunge
into
this
dreadful
abyss
where
the
black
water
lapping
sluggishly
made
stealthy
menacing
noises
very
evil
to
hear
at
last
i
turned
about
and
mighty
careful
and
so
made
my
ways
up
and
out
of
this
unhallowed
place
more
painfully
than
i
had
come
reaching
the
cave
at
last
and
very
thankful
i
sought
to
close
the
door
but
found
it
to
resist
my
efforts
this
but
made
me
the
more
determined
to
shut
out
this
evil
place
with
its
air
and
i
began
to
examine
this
door
to
discover
the
reason
of
its
immobility
now
this
as
i
have
said
was
a
narrow
door
and
set
betwixt
jambs
and
with
lintel
above
very
strong
and
excellent
well
contrived
but
as
i
lifted
my
candle
to
view
it
better
i
stopped
all
at
once
to
stare
up
at
a
something
fixed
midway
in
this
lintel
a
strange
shrivelled
black
thing
very
like
to
a
great
spider
with
writhen
legs
updrawn
and
now
peering
closer
i
saw
this
was
a
human
hand
hacked
off
midway
wrist
and
elbow
and
skewered
to
the
lintel
by
a
great
nail
and
as
i
stood
staring
up
at
this
evil
thing
from
somewhere
in
the
black
void
beyond
the
door
rose
a
long
agonised
wailing
that
rose
to
a
bubbling
shriek
and
though
i
knew
this
for
no
more
than
some
trick
of
the
wind
i
felt
my
flesh
tingle
to
sudden
chill
howbeit
i
lifted
my
candle
higher
yet
and
thus
saw
beneath
this
shrivelled
hand
a
parchment
nailed
very
precisely
at
its
four
corners
though
black
with
dust
wiping
this
dust
away
i
read
these
words
very
fair
writ
in
bold
clear
characters
james
ballantyne
his
hand
wherewith
he
foully
murdered
a
good
man
this
hand
cut
off
by
me
this
june
the
same
ballantyne
having
perished
suddenly
by
a
pistol
shot
according
to
my
oath
like
rogues
take
warning
adam
penfeather
in
a
while
i
turned
from
this
hateful
thing
and
coming
to
the
bed
began
to
examine
the
huddle
of
goatskins
and
though
full
of
dust
and
something
stiff
found
them
little
the
worse
for
their
long
disuse
the
same
applied
equally
to
the
sailcloth
the
which
though
yellow
was
still
strong
and
serviceable
reaching
the
firelock
from
the
corner
i
found
it
to
be
furnished
with
a
snaphaunce
or
flintlock
and
though
very
rusty
methought
cleaned
and
oiled
it
might
make
me
a
very
good
weapon
had
i
but
powder
and
shot
for
it
but
the
bandoliers
held
in
all
but
two
poor
charges
which
powder
i
determined
to
keep
for
the
pistol
therefore
i
set
the
musket
back
in
the
corner
and
doing
so
espied
a
book
that
lay
open
and
face
down
beneath
the
bedstead
taking
it
up
i
wiped
off
the
dust
and
opening
this
book
at
the
first
page
i
came
on
this
adam
penfeather
hys
journal
hereupon
perceiving
in
it
many
charts
and
maps
together
with
a
plan
of
the
island
very
well
drawn
i
thrust
it
into
my
bosom
and
hearing
my
lady
calling
me
took
pistol
and
bandolier
and
so
to
supper
thus
amidst
howling
storm
and
tempest
we
sat
down
side
by
side
to
sup
very
silent
for
the
most
part
by
reason
of
this
elemental
strife
that
raged
about
our
habitation
filling
the
world
with
awful
stir
and
clamour
but
in
a
while
seeing
her
so
downcast
and
with
head
i
must
needs
fall
gloomy
also
and
full
of
a
growing
bitterness
art
grieving
for
england
says
i
at
last
yearning
for
home
and
friends
and
some
man
belike
that
loves
and
is
beloved
again
and
why
not
martin
because
is
vain
and
yet
be
but
natural
aye
indeed
says
i
gloomily
and
forgetting
my
supper
for
contrasting
all
you
have
lost
home
and
friends
and
love
with
your
present
evil
plight
here
in
this
howling
wilderness
is
small
wonder
you
weep
but
i
am
not
weeping
says
she
flushing
yet
you
well
may
quoth
i
for
here
are
you
at
the
world
end
and
with
none
but
myself
for
company
why
truly
here
is
good
cause
for
tears
says
she
flashing
her
eyes
at
me
aye
i
nodded
is
a
pity
fate
hath
chosen
you
so
ill
a
companion
indeed
and
so
it
is
says
she
and
turns
her
back
on
me
and
so
we
sat
awhile
she
with
her
back
to
me
and
i
gloomy
and
despondent
hearkening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
you
eat
no
supper
says
i
at
last
neither
do
you
i
am
not
hungry
nor
i
myself
speaking
after
some
while
humbly
have
i
angered
you
she
mightily
myself
aye
but
how
she
by
your
idle
foolish
talk
for
if
i
grow
thoughtful
sometimes
why
must
you
ever
dream
me
repining
against
my
lot
hearkening
to
this
dreadful
tempest
i
was
full
of
gratitude
to
god
that
he
had
brought
us
to
this
safe
harbourage
and
set
me
in
your
companionship
and
if
my
heart
cry
out
for
england
sometimes
is
because
i
do
love
england
yet
my
days
here
are
too
full
of
labour
for
vain
grieving
and
my
labour
like
my
sleep
is
joy
to
me
and
there
is
no
man
i
love
in
england
or
anywhere
else
myself
and
more
humbly
than
ever
why
then
i
pray
you
forgive
me
comrade
at
this
she
looks
at
me
over
her
shoulder
frowning
and
a
little
askance
for
indeed
says
i
meeting
this
look
i
would
have
you
know
me
ever
as
your
comrade
to
serve
you
faithfully
seeking
only
your
friendship
and
nought
beyond
one
you
may
trust
unfearing
despite
my
ungentle
ways
and
now
i
saw
her
frown
was
vanished
quite
her
eyes
grown
wondrous
gentle
and
her
lips
curving
to
a
smile
and
so
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
me
and
thus
we
two
poor
desolate
souls
found
great
solace
and
comfort
in
each
other
companionship
and
hearkening
to
the
roar
of
this
mighty
tempest
felt
the
bonds
of
our
comradeship
only
strengthened
thereby
when
my
lady
was
gone
to
bed
i
remembering
adam
journal
took
it
out
and
drawing
the
candle
nearer
fell
to
examining
the
book
more
closely
it
was
a
smallish
volume
but
very
thick
and
with
very
many
pages
its
stout
leathern
covers
battered
and
stained
and
an
thing
i
thought
it
but
opening
it
haphazard
i
forgot
all
save
the
words
i
read
these
written
in
adam
small
clerkly
hand
for
i
came
on
this
may
glory
be
and
thanks
unto
that
providence
hath
been
my
salvation
and
poured
upon
unworthy
me
his
blessing
in
that
i
this
day
have
fought
and
killed
this
murderous
rogue
and
detestable
pirate
roger
tressady
here
followed
divers
accounts
of
his
labours
his
discovery
of
these
caves
and
many
cunning
devices
day
by
day
until
i
came
on
this
may
a
pinnace
standing
in
for
my
island
and
in
it
abnegation
mings
and
divers
others
of
bartlemy
rogues
survivors
as
i
judge
of
that
cursed
ship
lady
delight
they
landed
being
fifteen
in
all
and
i
in
great
fear
and
distress
therefore
they
leaving
their
boat
unwatched
i
stole
thither
and
to
my
great
joy
found
therein
a
and
bonnet
muskets
swords
pistols
with
powder
and
shot
all
of
which
did
hide
among
the
rocks
adjacent
a
cunning
where
i
may
fetch
them
at
my
leisure
providence
aiding
may
this
day
hour
before
dawn
secured
arms
powder
and
very
grateful
therefore
may
set
about
strengthening
and
fortifying
my
door
since
though
roger
tressady
is
dead
there
be
other
rogues
yet
to
slay
their
evil
minds
being
full
of
lust
for
black

this
morning
having
gotten
all
my

secret
chamber
do
find
myself
very
comfortable
but
my
stores
beginning
to
run
low
do
put
myself
on
june
my
murderers
very
silent
with
intent
to
lure
me
to
my
death
but
i
the
rest
of
this
page
was
so
stained
and
blotted
that
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
save
a
word
or
phrase
here
and
there
as
secret
pass
pit
of
black
water
and
very
fear
of
death
head
over

to
my
chin
so
that
i
miserably
wet
on
hands
and
knees
being
determined
wonderful
beyond
thought
for
here
tlemy
treasure
very
great
this
gold
i
saw
was
emeralds

and
pearls
through
my
fingers

any
poor
crazed

was
treasure
greater
moreover
and
wealth
undreamed

of
suddenly
the
valley
sore
annoyed
i
stood
to
he
knelt
seeking
the
water
turned
our
knives
through
my
forearm
but
i
broke
short
against
my
and
i
beneath
the
armpit
so
back
by
the
secret
way
to
bind
up
my
hurt
and
behold
again
my
treasure
here
my
candle
dying
out
and
i
in
the
dark
i
laid
the
book
aside
and
presently
got
me
to
sleep
chapter
xxxiii
we
explore
the
island
i
opened
my
eyes
to
a
great
beam
of
sun
pouring
in
at
the
open
doorway
whereby
i
judged
my
companion
already
astir
so
i
arose
forthwith
and
going
out
of
the
cave
stood
amazed
to
see
the
havoc
wrought
by
last
night
storm
for
everywhere
lay
trees
torn
and
uprooted
and
in
divers
of
the
more
exposed
places
the
wind
it
seemed
had
swept
them
utterly
away
so
that
the
landscape
here
and
there
wore
an
air
unfamiliar
and
not
to
be
recognised
though
the
wind
was
died
away
i
saw
the
sea
yet
rolling
tempestuous
to
break
in
foam
upon
the
reef
and
with
dreadful
roar
looking
down
on
deliverance
beach
i
beheld
its
white
sands
littered
with
piles
of
driftwood
and
over
all
a
cloudless
blue
with
the
sun
and
very
hot
and
now
taking
my
hooks
and
line
and
a
pliant
bough
for
rod
i
went
forth
to
angle
for
breakfast
reaching
the
lagoon
great
wonder
was
it
to
behold
these
waters
so
smooth
and
placid
while
the
surf
foamed
and
thundered
beyond
the
reef
i
now
baited
my
hooks
with
fat
of
the
goat
and
betook
me
to
my
angling
nor
had
i
long
to
wait
ere
i
felt
a
jerk
on
my
line
and
tingling
with
the
joy
of
it
i
whipped
my
rod
so
furiously
that
my
fish
whirled
glittering
through
the
air
and
flying
from
my
barbless
hook
lay
floundering
on
the
sands
behind
me
and
though
of
no
great
size
yet
a
very
good
fish
i
thought
him
and
indeed
i
found
the
fish
to
bite
readily
enough
and
mighty
dexterous
to
filch
my
bait
and
though
i
lost
yet
i
becoming
more
expert
contrived
to
land
five
likely
fish
of
different
sizes
and
of
marvellous
colouring
so
there
sat
i
in
the
shade
of
a
rock
mighty
content
and
quite
lost
in
the
joy
of
my
sport
until
chancing
to
lift
my
gaze
i
beheld
my
companion
upon
the
rocks
over
against
me
gazing
away
across
the
troubled
ocean
and
beholding
all
the
grace
of
her
as
she
stood
there
her
shapely
figure
poised
and
outlined
against
the
blue
sky
her
long
hair
rippling
in
the
soft
wind
i
clean
forgot
my
fish
for
indeed
it
seemed
i
had
not
noticed
the
vigorous
beauty
of
her
until
now
and
in
this
moment
as
i
sat
staring
up
at
her
she
turned
and
spying
me
waved
her
hand
in
cheery
greeting
and
begins
to
descend
these
rocks
leaping
from
ledge
to
ledge
lithe
and
graceful
as
any
fabled
nymph
or
goddess
of
them
all
but
i
well
knowing
the
danger
of
these
rocks
watched
her
with
breath
in
check
and
mighty
anxious
until
she
sprang
nimbly
to
the
sands
and
so
came
running
all
joyous
to
meet
me
hereupon
i
caught
up
my
forgotten
angle
and
found
my
hook
empty
whereat
she
must
needs
fall
at
my
discomfiture
o
martin
says
she
what
a
glory
of
sun
and
sea
and
sky
and
the
wind
so
sweet
indeed
it
seems
as
nature
would
make
us
amends
for
the
cruel
storm
for
the
poor
trees
have
suffered
greatly
aye
comrade
quoth
i
so
is
there
much
fruit
for
us
to
gather
ere
it
rot
and
great
store
of
which
are
good
food
and
useful
in
a
thousand
ways
but
nature
is
very
cruel
martin
for
i
have
seen
many
birds
lying
dead
and
over
yonder
a
poor
goat
crushed
by
a
tree
why
then
says
i
these
will
we
eat
also
at
least
such
as
we
may
nay
martin
your
mind
runneth
overmuch
on
food
methinks
mayhap
says
i
howbeit
here
are
fish
to
our
breakfast
hereupon
she
falls
on
her
knees
to
behold
my
catch
and
very
full
of
wonder
indeed
says
she
meseemeth
we
have
strayed
into
paradise
for
even
the
fish
are
beautiful
why
stare
you
so
martin
is
it
so
wonderful
i
joy
in
life
and
find
it
sweet
in
so
fair
a
world
and
on
such
a
day
moreover
i
have
been
swimming
how
says
i
and
the
sea
so
rough
i
have
found
me
a
little
bay
where
the
waters
run
smooth
and
deep
but
come
let
us
breakfast
for
martin
we
will
explore
our
island
why
i
had
thought
to
try
my
saw
says
i
i
had
intended
to
begin
a
chair
for
you
nay
let
this
rest
awhile
martin
i
yearn
to
adventure
the
unknown
who
can
say
what
marvels
and
wonders
lie
waiting
us
as
you
will
says
i
rising
and
so
away
to
the
plateau
now
very
soon
i
had
the
fire
and
while
she
bustled
to
and
fro
preparing
breakfast
and
singing
very
sweet
and
blithe
to
hear
i
took
the
pistol
and
having
cleaned
and
oiled
it
found
it
very
well
then
i
loaded
it
with
one
of
my
six
bullets
using
a
strip
from
my
ragged
shirtsleeve
for
wads
this
done
i
laid
it
by
and
going
for
adam
journal
i
cut
therefrom
the
map
of
the
island
and
fell
to
studying
it
with
a
view
to
our
forthcoming
journey
the
which
map
i
give
herewith
map
of
the
island
hearing
my
companion
call
me
i
went
out
to
find
breakfast
ready
the
fish
broiled
and
very
appetising
while
we
ate
i
showed
her
adam
map
and
she
greatly
pleased
therewith
and
anxious
to
know
how
i
came
by
it
all
of
which
i
told
her
and
she
examining
this
plan
grows
but
the
more
eager
to
be
gone
on
this
expedition
but
martin
says
she
all
at
once
as
she
studied
the
map
master
penfeather
would
seem
to
have
been
forced
to
slay
a
great
number
of
poor
men
here
be
one
two
three
o
many
men
all
dead
by
his
hand
and
each
marked
with
a
little
cross
aye
i
nodded
and
each
and
every
of
necessity
which
meaneth
what
martin
murder
like
as
not
though
is
all
cunningly
glozed
in
his
journal
i
would
fain
see
this
journal
martin
why
so
you
shall
and
judge
thereby
whether
he
be
rogue
or
no
for
beyond
me
but
now
says
she
rising
let
us
make
ready
for
our
journey
though
be
no
great
matter
for
according
to
this
plan
the
island
is
no
more
than
seven
miles
long
and
some
five
miles
wide
even
so
quoth
i
be
ill
travelling
by
reason
of
woods
and
tangled
thickets
swamps
and
the
like
so
i
judge
take
the
whole
day
why
then
says
she
leaping
up
the
sooner
we
start
the
better
martin
hereupon
finding
her
so
set
on
it
i
proceeded
to
equip
myself
for
the
journey
in
my
belt
i
thrust
my
trusty
knife
and
the
hatchet
these
balanced
by
the
pistol
and
over
my
shoulder
i
slung
my
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
and
chose
me
a
good
stout
sapling
for
staff
soon
cometh
my
companion
her
slender
middle
girt
by
a
goatskin
girdle
whereto
she
had
hung
our
other
and
my
wallet
so
we
set
out
together
side
by
side
reaching
the
little
valley
we
turned
off
to
the
right
or
westerly
according
to
adam
map
following
the
stream
that
rippled
amid
great
boulders
or
flowed
banks
adorned
with
flowers
most
rare
to
be
seen
and
here
were
bushes
of
all
kinds
and
trees
untouched
by
the
gale
for
the
little
valley
being
well
secluded
it
fortuned
the
wind
had
passed
over
it
up
rose
the
sun
waxing
ever
hotter
so
that
reaching
a
grove
of
trees
i
would
have
my
companion
rest
awhile
in
this
right
pleasant
shade
the
whiles
i
with
certain
great
leaves
contrived
a
covering
for
her
head
and
another
for
my
own
which
done
we
fared
on
again
and
she
very
merry
by
reason
of
the
strange
figures
we
cut
thus
we
presently
came
out
of
the
valley
into
a
pleasant
champain
a
rolling
grassy
upland
with
dim
woods
beyond
even
as
adam
had
set
forth
in
his
map
wherefore
guided
by
this
map
we
struck
off
north
and
so
in
a
while
came
again
to
the
river
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
away
to
our
left
and
turning
thither
i
being
minded
to
show
her
this
wonder
we
saw
before
us
a
high
land
well
girt
by
bush
and
fern
and
flowering
shrubs
up
which
we
scrambled
forthwith
the
roar
of
the
fall
waxing
louder
as
we
climbed
reaching
the
summit
we
saw
it
had
once
been
covered
by
noble
trees
some
few
of
which
the
storm
had
left
standing
yet
but
for
the
most
part
they
lay
in
wild
and
tangled
confusion
o
martin
says
my
companion
o
martin
and
so
stood
awed
by
the
destruction
wrought
by
this
mighty
and
pitiless
tempest
here
was
but
by
dint
of
labour
with
my
hatchet
i
forced
us
a
way
through
the
wreckage
until
we
suddenly
came
where
we
might
behold
the
fall
that
leapt
from
the
adjacent
rocks
all
to
plunge
into
those
deep
and
troubled
waters
below
and
now
instead
of
bursting
forth
into
cries
of
delighted
wonder
as
i
had
expected
my
companion
stood
mute
and
still
her
hands
viewing
now
the
splendour
of
these
falling
waters
now
the
deeps
below
like
one
quite
dumbfounded
at
last
o
martin
says
she
in
my
ear
for
the
noise
of
the
fall
was
very
loud
here
is
wonder
on
wonder
as
how
comrade
this
great
body
of
water
for
all
its
weight
yet
disturbeth
yonder
black
depths
very
little
and
how
should
this
chance
except
this
dark
lake
be
immeasurably
deep
aye
true
says
i
here
belike
was
a
volcano
once
and
this
the
crater
hard
by
a
great
rock
jutted
out
above
the
lake
that
same
barren
rock
wherein
i
had
sat
the
day
i
discovered
this
cataract
now
as
i
viewed
this
rock
i
was
struck
by
its
grotesque
shape
and
then
all
at
once
i
saw
it
was
hatefully
like
to
a
shrivelled
head
there
were
the
fleshless
jaws
the
shrunken
nose
and
great
hollow
and
now
even
as
i
stared
at
the
thing
my
companion
spied
it
also
for
i
felt
her
hand
on
my
arm
and
saw
her
stand
to
view
it
so
we
speaking
no
word
stared
upon
this
shape
and
ever
as
we
stared
the
nameless
evil
of
it
seemed
to
grow
insomuch
that
we
turned
with
one
accord
and
hasted
away
yonder
was
an
ill
sight
martin
indeed
says
i
was
like
the
face
of
one
long
dead
and
yet
is
no
more
than
a
volcanic
rock
nature
playeth
strange
tricks
sometimes
and
here
was
one
vastly
strange
and
most
unlovely
after
this
we
went
on
side
by
side
and
never
a
word
betwixt
us
until
we
had
reached
that
pleasant
champain
country
where
flowed
the
river
shaded
by
goodly
trees
in
whose
branches
fluttered
birds
of
a
plumage
marvellously
coloured
and
diverse
and
beneath
which
bloomed
flowers
as
vivid
insomuch
that
my
lady
brake
forth
ever
and
anon
into
little
soft
cries
of
delighted
wonder
and
yet
despite
all
these
marvels
it
was
long
ere
we
shook
off
the
evil
of
that
ghastly
rock
presently
as
we
journeyed
came
a
wind
sweet
and
fresh
from
the
sea
offsetting
the
sun
immoderate
heat
to
our
great
comfort
so
that
though
ofttimes
our
way
was
toilsome
our
spirits
rose
notwithstanding
and
we
laughed
and
talked
unfeignedly
as
only
good
comrades
may
by
noon
we
had
reached
a
place
of
rocks
where
according
to
adam
map
should
be
a
ford
though
hereabouts
the
stream
swollen
by
the
late
rains
ran
deep
howbeit
we
presently
came
upon
the
ford
sure
enough
and
having
crossed
it
my
lady
must
needs
fall
to
admiring
at
her
new
shoes
again
finding
them
and
they
so
comfortable
and
easy
to
go
in
martin
why
you
have
footed
it
bravely
thus
far
says
i
but
but
says
she
and
what
then
you
shall
find
me
no
laggard
these
days
martin
indeed
i
could
run
fast
as
you
for
all
your
long
legs
sir
so
she
challenges
me
to
race
her
forthwith
whereupon
and
despite
the
sun
we
started
off
side
by
side
and
she
so
fleet
that
i
might
scarce
keep
pace
with
her
thus
we
ran
until
at
last
we
stopped
all
flushed
and
breathless
and
laughing
for
the
pure
joy
of
it
presently
in
our
going
we
came
on
a
little
dell
very
shady
and
pleasantly
secluded
where
flowers
bloomed
and
great
clusters
of
wild
grapes
hung
ripe
for
the
plucking
and
mighty
pleasant
methought
it
to
behold
my
companion
pleased
wonderment
here
we
sat
to
rest
and
found
these
grapes
very
sweet
and
refreshing
much
might
i
tell
of
the
marvels
of
this
island
of
fruit
and
bird
and
beast
of
the
great
butterflies
that
wheeled
and
hovered
resplendent
and
of
the
many
and
divers
wonders
that
beset
us
at
every
turn
but
lest
my
narrative
grow
to
immoderate
length
of
the
which
i
do
already
begin
to
entertain
some
doubt
i
will
pass
these
with
this
mere
mention
and
hurry
on
to
say
that
we
tramped
blithely
on
until
the
sun
declining
westwards
warned
us
to
be
turning
back
but
close
before
us
rose
that
high
hill
whose
summit
towered
above
the
island
and
my
companion
mighty
determined
that
she
must
climb
it
for
martin
says
she
scornful
of
all
weariness
once
up
there
we
may
behold
all
our
domain
spread
out
before
us
so
having
skirted
the
woods
and
avoided
tangled
thickets
as
well
as
we
might
we
began
the
ascent
which
we
found
to
be
no
great
matter
after
all
and
now
i
bethought
me
how
adam
had
sped
hotfoot
up
hereabouts
on
a
time
and
with
tressady
glittering
hook
ringing
loud
on
the
rocks
behind
him
more
than
once
as
we
climbed
we
came
on
flocks
of
goats
that
scampered
off
at
sight
of
us
here
too
i
remarked
divers
great
birds
and
determined
to
try
a
shot
at
one
if
chance
should
offer
as
to
my
companion
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
up
with
her
until
flushed
and
breathless
she
turned
to
view
me
all
where
we
stood
panting
upon
the
summit
and
now
beholding
the
prospect
below
she
uttered
a
soft
inarticulate
cry
and
sinking
down
upon
the
sward
pushed
the
damp
curls
from
her
brow
the
better
to
survey
the
scene
outstretched
before
us
a
rolling
wooded
country
of
broad
savannahs
of
stately
groves
and
mazy
boskages
of
dim
woods
and
flashing
streams
a
blended
harmony
of
greens
here
and
there
with
blossoming
thickets
or
flowering
trees
the
whole
shut
in
by
towering
cliffs
and
bounded
by
a
limitless
ocean
blue
as
any
sapphire
viewing
the
island
from
this
eminence
i
could
see
that
adam
map
was
true
in
all
essentials
as
to
shape
and
general
trend
of
the
country
and
sitting
beside
my
lady
i
fell
to
viewing
the
island
more
narrowly
especially
this
eminent
place
and
looking
about
me
i
called
to
mind
how
adam
according
to
his
story
had
waged
desperate
fight
with
tressady
hereabouts
indeed
i
thought
to
recognise
the
very
spot
itself
a
narrow
ledge
of
rock
with
far
below
a
sea
that
ran
deeply
blue
to
break
in
foam
against
the
base
of
these
precipitous
cliffs
away
over
hill
and
dale
i
saw
that
greeny
cliff
with
its
silver
thread
of
falling
water
that
marked
our
refuge
and
beyond
this
again
on
my
right
hand
the
white
spume
of
the
breakers
on
the
reef
and
beholding
the
beauties
thus
spread
out
before
my
eyes
and
knowing
myself
undisputed
lord
of
it
all
there
grew
within
me
a
sense
of
joy
unknown
hitherto
at
last
moved
by
a
sudden
thought
i
turned
from
the
beauties
of
this
our
island
to
study
the
beauty
of
her
who
sat
beside
me
the
proud
carriage
of
her
shapely
head
its
silky
masses
of
hair
the
level
brows
the
calm
deep
serenity
of
her
blue
eyes
the
delicate
nose
full
red
lips
and
dimpled
chin
the
soft
round
column
of
her
throat
deep
bosom
and
slender
waist
thus
sat
i
staring
upon
her
loveliness
heedless
of
all
else
until
she
stirred
uneasily
as
if
conscious
of
my
regard
and
looked
at
me
then
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
serene
no
longer
whiles
all
at
once
throat
and
cheeks
and
brow
were
suffused
with
slow
and
painful
colour
yet
even
as
i
gazed
on
her
she
met
my
look
unflinching
what
is
it
martin
she
questioned
a
little
breathless
still
suppose
says
i
slowly
suppose
we
are
never
taken
hence
suppose
we
are
destined
to
end
our
days
here
surely
this
is
an
ill
thought
martin
indeed
and
is
it
my
lady
can
the
world
offer
a
home
more
fair
surely
not
martin
then
wherein
lieth
the
ill
damaris
is
it
that
you
do
yearn
so
mightily
for
england
there
lieth
my
home
martin
is
home
then
so
dear
to
you
here
finding
no
answer
she
grew
troubled
or
is
it
says
i
bending
my
staff
across
my
knee
and
beginning
to
frown
or
is
it
that
there
waits
some
man
yonder
that
you
love
no
martin
have
i
not
told
you
why
then
says
i
is
it
that
you
grow
of
my
unlovely
ways
and
would
be
quit
of
me
no
martin
only
only
here
she
fell
silent
and
i
saw
her
flush
again
or
is
it
that
you
fear
i
might
grow
to
love
you
in
time
to
love
me
says
she
very
softly
and
now
i
saw
her
red
lips
dimple
to
a
smile
as
she
stooped
to
cull
a
flower
blooming
hard
by
nay
says
she
lightly
here
were
a
wonder
beyond
thought
martin
and
wherefore
should
this
be
so
great
wonder
i
demanded
because
i
am
joan
brandon
and
you
are
a
man
vowed
and
sworn
to
vengeance
martin
vengeance
says
i
and
with
the
word
the
staff
snapped
in
my
hands
is
it
not
so
martin
she
questioned
wistfully
given
freedom
from
this
island
would
you
not
go
seeking
your
enemy
life
dream
you
not
of
vengeance
still
aye
true
says
i
true
how
should
it
be
otherwise
come
let
us
begone
and
casting
away
my
broken
staff
i
got
to
my
feet
but
she
sitting
there
lifted
her
head
to
view
me
with
look
mighty
strange
poor
martin
says
she
softly
poor
martin
then
she
arose
albeit
slow
and
wearily
and
we
went
down
the
hill
together
now
as
we
went
thus
i
in
black
humour
and
never
a
word
i
espied
one
of
those
great
birds
i
have
mentioned
within
easy
range
and
whipping
off
my
bow
i
strung
it
and
setting
arrow
on
cord
let
fly
and
brought
down
my
quarry
as
luck
would
have
it
and
running
forward
had
very
soon
despatched
it
why
must
you
kill
the
poor
thing
martin
for
supper
supper
waiteth
us
at
home
home
says
i
the
cave
martin
we
shall
not
reach
there
this
night
be
dark
in
another
hour
and
there
is
no
moon
so
needs
must
we
bide
here
as
you
will
martin
hard
beside
the
river
that
wound
a
devious
course
through
the
green
was
a
little
grove
and
sitting
here
i
fell
to
plucking
the
bird
shall
i
not
do
that
martin
i
can
do
it
well
enough
as
you
wish
martin
you
are
weary
doubtless
why
is
no
great
labour
to
cook
supper
martin
howbeit
i
try
my
hand
very
well
says
she
and
away
she
goes
to
collect
sticks
for
the
fire
whiles
i
sat
feathering
the
bird
and
found
the
flesh
of
it
very
white
and
delicate
but
all
the
while
my
anger
swelled
within
me
for
the
folly
i
had
uttered
to
her
in
a
moment
of
impulse
concerning
love
thus
as
she
knelt
to
build
the
fire
i
spoke
my
thought
i
said
a
vain
and
foolish
thing
to
you
a
while
since
aye
martin
you
did
says
she
bending
over
her
pile
of
sticks
but
which
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
folly
regarding
love
o
was
that
folly
martin
she
questioned
busy
laying
the
sticks
in
place
arrant
folly
for
i
could
never
love
you
or
any
woman
o
why
not
martin
because
i
have
no
gift
no
leaning
that
way
nor
ever
shall
why
indeed
you
are
no
ordinary
man
martin
shall
i
light
the
fire
no
i
will
yes
martin
and
down
she
sits
with
folded
hands
watching
me
mighty
solemn
and
demure
and
i
very
conscious
of
her
scrutiny
having
plucked
and
drawn
my
bird
i
fell
to
trimming
it
with
my
knife
yet
all
the
time
feeling
her
gaze
upon
me
so
that
what
with
this
and
my
anger
i
pricked
my
thumb
and
cursed
beneath
my
breath
whereupon
she
arose
and
left
me
having
thus
prepared
my
bird
for
cooking
i
set
it
upon
two
sticks
and
lighting
the
fire
sat
down
to
watch
it
but
scarce
had
i
done
so
when
back
comes
my
lady
martin
says
she
should
you
not
truss
your
bird
first
martin
do
as
it
is
very
well
martin
but
why
are
you
so
short
with
me
i
am
surly
by
nature
quoth
i
aye
true
she
nodded
but
why
are
you
angry
with
me
this
time
i
ha
forgot
you
were
merry
enough
this
noon
and
laughed
gaily
and
once
you
fell
the
more
fool
i
why
then
methinks
i
do
like
your
folly
sometimes
says
she
softly
but
now
see
this
river
martin
is
called
the
serpent
water
in
the
map
and
indeed
it
winds
and
twists
like
any
snake
but
where
should
so
much
water
come
from
think
you
let
us
go
look
nay
not
i
here
the
bird
to
tend
why
then
says
she
stamping
her
foot
at
me
in
sudden
anger
stay
where
you
are
until
you
find
your
temper
and
may
your
bird
burn
to
a
cinder
and
away
she
goes
forthwith
and
i
staring
after
her
like
any
fool
until
she
was
out
of
sight
so
there
sat
i
beside
the
fire
and
giving
all
due
heed
to
my
cooking
but
in
a
while
i
fell
to
deep
reflection
and
became
so
lost
in
my
thoughts
that
roused
by
a
smell
of
burning
i
started
up
to
find
my
bird
woefully
singed
this
put
me
in
fine
rage
so
that
i
was
minded
to
cast
the
carcass
into
the
fire
and
have
done
with
it
and
my
anger
grew
as
the
time
passed
and
my
companion
came
not
the
sun
sank
rapidly
and
the
bird
i
judged
done
wherefore
i
began
to
shout
and
halloo
bidding
her
to
supper
but
the
shadows
deepening
and
getting
no
answer
to
my
outcries
i
started
up
clean
forgetting
my
cookery
and
hasted
off
in
search
of
my
companion
calling
her
name
now
and
then
as
i
went
following
the
stream
i
found
it
to
narrow
suddenly
and
it
running
very
furious
and
deep
perceiving
which
i
began
to
fear
lest
some
mischance
had
befallen
my
wilful
lady
presently
as
i
hurried
on
casting
my
eyes
here
and
there
in
search
of
her
i
heard
above
the
rush
of
the
water
a
strange
and
intermittent
roaring
the
which
i
could
make
nothing
of
until
at
last
forcing
my
way
through
the
underbrush
i
saw
before
me
a
column
of
water
that
spouted
up
into
the
air
from
a
fissure
at
the
base
of
the
hill
and
this
waterspout
was
about
the
bigness
of
a
tree
and
gushed
up
some
twenty
feet
or
so
now
sinking
to
half
this
height
only
to
rise
again
scarce
pausing
to
behold
this
wonder
i
would
have
hasted
on
and
roaring
louder
than
the
water
when
i
beheld
her
seated
close
by
upon
a
rock
and
watching
me
chin
in
hand
why
must
you
shout
so
loud
says
she
reprovingly
i
feared
you
lost
says
i
like
any
fool
would
it
matter
so
much
and
you
so
angry
with
me
and
no
reason
howbeit
supper
is
ready
i
am
not
hungry
i
thank
you
sir
but
i
am
then
go
eat
not
alone
says
i
and
then
very
humbly
prithee
comrade
come
to
supper
indeed
you
should
be
hungry
and
indeed
martin
says
she
rising
and
giving
me
her
hand
i
do
think
i
am
vastly
hungry
after
all
so
back
we
went
together
and
reaching
the
fire
found
the
accursed
bird
burned
black
as
any
coal
whereupon
i
stood
mighty
downcast
and
abashed
the
while
she
laughed
and
laughed
until
she
needs
must
lean
against
a
tree
and
i
seeing
her
thus
merry
at
my
expense
presently
laughed
also
hereupon
she
falls
on
her
knees
and
taking
the
thing
from
the
fire
sets
it
upon
a
great
leaf
for
dish
and
turns
it
this
way
and
that
good
lack
martin
says
she
is
burned
as
black
as
i
wished
this
cometh
of
your
usurpation
of
my
duties
sir
and
yet
methinks
not
utterly
spoiled
and
drawing
her
knife
she
scrapes
and
trims
it
cutting
away
the
burned
parts
until
there
little
enough
remained
but
that
mighty
delectable
judging
by
the
smell
of
it
so
down
we
sat
to
supper
forthwith
and
mighty
amicable
nay
indeed
methought
her
kinder
than
ordinary
and
our
friendship
only
the
stronger
which
did
comfort
me
mightily
but
our
supper
done
we
spake
little
for
night
was
come
upon
us
very
still
and
dark
save
for
a
glitter
of
stars
by
whose
unearthly
light
all
things
took
on
strange
shapes
and
our
solitude
seemed
but
the
more
profound
and
awesome
above
us
a
purple
sky
by
a
myriad
stars
a
countless
host
whose
distant
splendour
throbbed
upon
the
night
round
about
us
a
gloom
of
woods
and
thickets
that
hemmed
us
in
like
a
dark
and
sombre
tide
whence
stole
a
sweet
air
fraught
with
spicy
odours
and
over
all
a
deep
and
brooding
quietude
but
little
by
little
upon
this
silence
crept
sounds
near
and
far
leafy
rustlings
a
stirring
in
the
undergrowth
the
whimper
of
some
animal
the
croak
of
a
bird
and
the
faint
murmur
of
the
surge
and
i
gazing
thus
upon
this
measureless
immensity
felt
myself
humbled
thereby
and
with
this
came
a
knowledge
of
the
futility
of
my
life
hitherto
and
now
as
often
she
had
done
ere
this
my
companion
voiced
the
thought
i
had
no
words
for
martin
says
she
softly
what
pitiful
things
are
we
lost
thus
in
god
infinity
and
doth
it
affright
you
damaris
no
martin
for
god
is
yet
i
needs
must
think
how
vain
our
little
strivings
our
hopes
and
fears
how
small
our
joys
and
sorrows
aye
truly
truly
quoth
i
but
says
she
leaning
towards
me
in
the
firelight
and
with
her
gaze
uplifted
to
the
starry
heavens
he
who
made
the
heavens
is
a
merciful
god
hath
made
great
lights
the
moon
and
the
stars
to
govern
the
night
so
martin
us
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
forever
and
in
this
knowledge
methinks
we
may
surely
rest
secure
after
this
we
fell
silent
again
i
for
one
being
very
full
of
troublesome
thought
and
perplexity
and
the
sum
of
it
this
whether
a
woman
cast
alone
on
a
desolate
island
with
a
man
such
as
i
had
need
to
fear
him
to
the
which
question
answer
found
i
none
wherefore
i
got
me
another
speculation
to
wit
whether
a
man
and
woman
thus
solitary
must
needs
go
in
love
with
one
another
finding
no
answer
to
this
either
i
turned
to
put
the
question
to
my
companion
and
found
her
fast
asleep
she
lay
in
the
light
of
the
fire
her
face
a
tress
of
shining
hair
and
i
viewing
her
chin
in
fist
saw
in
her
only
the
last
of
her
hated
race
and
knew
in
that
moment
that
never
might
there
be
aught
of
true
love
that
pure
passion
high
and
ennobling
the
which
may
lift
man
above
his
baser
self
never
might
this
be
her
blood
and
mine
and
knowing
this
i
knew
also
great
doubt
and
fear
of
myself
and
in
my
fear
i
lifted
my
gaze
to
the
stars
those
great
lights
set
there
by
the
hand
of
god
and
spake
thus
within
myself
lord
god
quoth
i
since
love
is
not
nor
ever
shall
be
this
my
companion
and
me
do
thou
protect
her
from
the
devil
within
me
do
thou
aid
me
to
keep
the
oath
i
sware
in
thy
name
but
now
and
my
prayer
scarce
uttered
the
devil
sprang
and
was
upon
me
and
i
forgetting
all
my
oaths
and
resolutions
yielded
me
joyously
to
his
will
stirring
in
her
slumbers
my
lady
sighed
turned
and
throwing
her
arm
out
it
chanced
that
her
hand
came
upon
my
knee
and
rested
there
and
i
shivering
at
her
touch
seized
this
hand
and
caught
it
to
my
lips
and
began
to
kiss
these
helpless
fingers
and
the
round
soft
arm
above
i
felt
her
start
heard
her
breath
catch
in
a
sob
but
in
my
madness
i
swept
her
to
my
embrace
then
as
i
stooped
she
held
me
off
striving
fiercely
against
me
all
at
once
her
struggles
ceased
and
i
heard
her
breath
come
in
a
long
tremulous
sigh
martin
says
she
o
thank
god
is
you
i
dreamed
these
black
bartlemy
cruel
arms
about
me
and
i
was
sick
with
fear
and
horror
thank
god
is
you
dear
martin
and
i
safe
from
all
harms
soever
so
hold
me
an
you
will
martin
you
that
have
saved
me
from
so
much
and
will
do
till
the
end
aye
by
god
says
i
bending
my
head
above
her
that
she
might
not
see
my
face
and
so
i
will
faithfully
truly
until
the
very
end
do
i
not
know
it
o
do
i
not
know
it
says
she
in
choking
voice
and
here
lying
beside
me
she
must
take
my
hand
and
hold
it
to
her
soft
cheek
indeed
i
do
think
there
is
no
man
like
you
in
the
whole
world
at
this
knowing
myself
so
unworthy
i
thought
no
man
in
the
world
so
miserable
as
i
as
i
would
have
told
her
but
dared
not
god
make
me
worthy
of
your
trust
says
i
at
last
is
a
good
prayer
martin
now
hear
mine
is
one
i
have
prayed
full
oft
god
make
you
strong
enough
to
forgive
past
wrongs
and
forgetting
vengeance
to
love
your
enemy
is
thing
impossible
says
i
yet
the
impossible
shall
come
to
pass
soon
or
late
martin
this
am
i
sure
and
why
so
sure
my
heart
telleth
me
so
says
she
drowsily
and
looking
down
i
saw
her
eyes
were
closed
and
she
on
the
verge
of
slumber
and
beholding
her
thus
my
grew
insomuch
that
her
fingers
loosing
their
hold
i
stole
away
my
hand
and
seeing
her
asleep
crept
from
the
place
being
come
to
the
stream
i
stood
awhile
staring
down
at
the
hurrying
waters
minded
to
cast
myself
therein
but
presently
i
turned
aside
and
coming
amid
leafy
gloom
lay
there
outstretched
my
face
hidden
from
the
stars
and
i
very
full
of
bitterness
for
it
seemed
that
i
was
as
great
a
rogue
and
as
vile
as
ever
bartlemy
had
been
and
thus
merciful
sleep
found
me
at
last
chapter
xxxiv
how
i
stood
resolute
in
my
folly
the
day
was
still
young
when
we
reached
our
habitation
and
both
of
us
glad
to
return
especially
my
lady
for
truly
i
do
grow
to
love
this
home
of
ours
says
she
and
sets
herself
to
sweeping
out
her
three
caves
as
for
me
i
was
determined
on
making
her
an
arm
chair
forthright
to
the
which
end
i
took
my
saw
and
set
out
for
deliverance
sands
there
to
cut
and
select
such
timber
as
i
needed
from
my
store
but
scarce
was
i
come
hither
than
i
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
for
there
cast
up
high
upon
these
white
sands
lay
a
great
mast
in
a
tangle
of
ropes
and
cordage
drawing
near
i
saw
this
for
the
mainmast
of
some
noble
ship
but
lately
wrecked
wherefore
i
hasted
along
the
beach
and
out
upon
the
reef
to
see
if
haply
any
other
wreckage
had
come
ashore
but
found
nothing
to
reward
my
search
returning
to
the
mast
i
saw
to
my
joy
that
this
cordage
was
all
new
and
sound
though
woefully
tangled
howbeit
i
had
soon
unravelled
some
fifty
yards
of
good
stout
twine
and
abundance
of
more
yet
to
hand
together
with
the
heavier
ropes
such
as
shrouds
and
taking
this
line
i
came
to
that
rocky
cleft
where
i
had
killed
the
goat
and
clambering
up
the
cliff
found
it
to
be
with
caves
large
and
small
and
with
abundant
evidences
of
the
animals
i
sought
wherefore
choosing
me
a
narrow
track
i
set
there
a
trap
formed
of
a
running
noose
and
this
did
i
in
divers
other
places
which
done
i
returned
to
my
labours
on
the
mast
at
the
which
occupation
my
lady
finding
me
must
needs
fall
to
work
beside
me
aiding
as
well
as
she
might
like
the
true
comrade
she
was
thus
by
late
afternoon
i
had
coiled
and
stowed
safely
away
more
good
hempen
rope
and
cordage
than
i
could
ever
want
this
accomplished
i
found
time
to
praise
my
companion
diligence
but
finding
her
all
wearied
out
with
such
rough
and
arduous
labour
grew
mighty
vexed
with
my
heedlessness
reproaching
myself
therewith
but
she
and
all
toilworn
as
she
was
laughed
her
weariness
to
scorn
as
was
ever
her
way
why
martin
says
she
labour
is
a
good
thing
and
noble
since
it
giveth
health
and
strength
to
both
mind
and
body
and
is
my
joy
to
share
in
your
labours
when
i
may
and
a
delight
to
see
how
cast
here
destitute
of
all
things
you
have
contrived
so
much
already
the
more
i
work
and
the
harder
the
more
able
am
i
for
work
so
trouble
not
if
i
do
grow
a
little
weary
sometimes
this
comforted
me
somewhat
until
chancing
to
see
her
hands
i
caught
them
in
mine
and
turning
them
saw
these
tender
palms
all
red
and
blistered
with
the
ropes
and
grieving
over
them
i
would
have
kissed
the
poor
little
things
had
i
dared
and
indeed
came
mighty
nigh
doing
it
as
she
perceived
i
think
for
she
flushed
and
laughed
and
drew
them
from
my
hold
nay
martin
says
she
softly
i
would
have
you
forget
my
sex
sometimes
a
thing
impossible
says
i
whereat
she
stealing
a
glance
at
me
flushed
all
the
hotter
why
then
says
she
you
must
not
coddle
and
cosset
me
because
i
am
a
woman
never
quoth
i
is
not
my
nature
to
do
so
and
yet
you
do
martin
as
how
o
in
many
ways
these
blisters
now
why
should
your
hands
grow
rough
and
hard
and
not
mine
nature
hath
formed
me
woman
but
fate
hath
made
me
your
comrade
martin
and
how
may
i
be
truly
your
comrade
except
i
share
your
toil
now
when
i
would
have
answered
i
could
not
and
turning
from
her
to
stare
away
across
the
limitless
ocean
saw
it
through
a
mist
as
it
were
surely
says
i
at
last
o
surely
never
had
man
so
sweet
and
true
a
comrade
and
i
so
rude
and
unlovely
and
in
all
ways
so
unworthy
but
you
are
not
martin
you
are
not
aye
but
i
am
beyond
your
guessing
you
that
are
so
pure
so
saintly
saintly
o
martin
and
here
she
laughs
albeit
a
little
tremulously
surely
i
am
a
very
human
saint
for
i
do
grow
mighty
hungry
and
yearn
for
my
supper
so
prithee
let
us
go
and
eat
but
on
our
way
we
turned
aside
to
see
if
we
had
any
fortune
with
my
snares
sure
enough
coming
nigh
the
place
we
heard
a
shuffling
and
snorting
and
presently
discovered
a
goat
fast
by
the
neck
and
and
beside
her
a
little
kid
pitifully
o
martin
cries
my
lady
and
falling
on
her
knees
began
caressing
and
fondling
the
little
creature
whiles
i
secured
the
dam
and
mighty
joyful
the
goat
for
all
its
strangling
strove
mightily
but
lashing
its
fore
and
hind
legs
i
contrived
to
get
it
upon
my
shoulders
and
thus
burdened
set
off
homewards
my
lady
carrying
the
kid
clasped
to
her
bosom
and
it
very
content
there
and
small
wonder
is
sweet
pretty
thing
says
my
lady
stroking
its
silky
hair
and
shall
soon
grow
tame
and
here
is
the
beginning
of
our
flock
our
cheese
and
butter
shall
not
be
long
now
comrade
you
must
fashion
me
a
press
martin
and
a
churn
says
i
nay
i
can
manage
well
enough
with
one
of
our
pipkins
but
a
churn
would
be
easier
for
you
so
a
churn
you
shall
have
of
sorts
this
evening
after
supper
sitting
by
our
fire
my
lady
and
despite
her
weariness
was
merrier
than
her
wont
and
very
full
of
plans
for
the
future
deciding
for
me
what
furniture
i
must
construct
next
as
chairs
two
a
cupboard
with
shelves
and
where
these
should
stand
when
made
and
martin
says
she
now
that
we
own
goats
i
must
have
a
dairy
for
my
and
my
dairy
shall
be
our
larder
aye
and
stillroom
too
for
i
have
been
tending
our
garden
lately
and
found
growing
many
good
herbs
and
simples
in
time
martin
these
caves
shall
grow
into
a
home
indeed
and
all
wrought
by
our
own
hands
and
this
is
a
sweet
thought
why
so
it
is
says
i
in
very
truth
but
but
what
sir
she
questioned
lifting
admonishing
finger
there
may
come
a
day
when
we
may
weary
of
it
how
then
nay
we
are
too
busy
can
it
could
it
be
says
i
beginning
to
stammer
that
you
might
live
here
thus
content
to
the
end
of
your
days
the
end
of
my
days
says
she
staring
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
why
martin
this
is
a
long
way
in
the
future
i
do
pray
and
our
future
is
in
the
hands
of
god
so
wherefore
trouble
because
i
who
have
been
stranger
to
happiness
hitherto
dread
lest
it
may
desert
me
and
leave
me
the
more
woeful
are
you
then
happy
at
last
and
so
suddenly
martin
now
this
put
me
to
no
little
and
perplexity
for
casting
back
over
the
time
since
our
landing
on
the
island
i
knew
that
despite
my
glooms
and
happiness
had
come
to
me
in
that
hour
i
had
found
her
alive
why
i
am
no
longer
the
miserable
wretch
i
was
quoth
i
at
last
because
of
late
you
have
forgot
to
grieve
for
yourself
and
past
wrong
and
sorrows
martin
mayhap
you
shall
one
day
forget
them
quite
never
quoth
i
yet
so
do
i
hope
martin
with
all
my
heart
says
she
and
with
a
great
sigh
why
then
fain
would
i
forget
an
i
might
but
is
beyond
me
the
agony
of
the
the
shame
of
stripes
the
blood
and
bestiality
of
it
all
these
i
may
never
forget
why
then
martin
dear
martin
says
she
all
suddenly
slipping
from
her
stool
to
kneel
before
me
and
reach
out
her
two
hands
i
do
pray
our
heavenly
father
here
and
now
before
you
that
you
remembering
all
this
agony
and
shame
may
make
of
it
a
crown
of
glory
ennobling
your
manhood
that
you
forgetting
nothing
may
yet
put
vengeance
from
you
now
and
for
ever
and
strive
to
forget
to
forgive
martin
and
win
thereby
your
manhood
and
a
happiness
undreamed
here
she
stopped
her
bosom
heaving
her
eyes
all
tender
pleading
and
i
o
deaf
and
purblind
fool
hearing
heard
not
and
seeing
saw
nought
but
the
witching
beauty
of
her
and
now
having
her
hands
in
mine
beholding
her
so
near
i
loosed
her
hands
and
turned
away
lest
i
should
crush
her
to
me
is
impossible
i
muttered
i
am
a
man
and
no
angel
is
impossible
hereupon
she
rose
and
stood
some
while
looking
down
into
the
fire
and
never
a
word
suddenly
she
turned
as
to
leave
me
then
sitting
on
her
stool
drew
out
her
hairpins
and
shook
down
her
shining
hair
that
showed
where
the
light
caught
it
and
beholding
her
thus
her
lovely
face
offset
by
the
curtain
of
her
hair
her
deep
eyes
the
vivid
scarlet
of
her
mouth
i
knew
the
world
might
nowhere
show
me
a
maid
so
perfect
in
beauty
nor
so
vitally
a
woman
martin
says
she
very
softly
as
she
began
braiding
a
thick
tress
of
hair
have
you
ever
truly
loved
any
woman
no
says
i
no
could
you
so
love
i
wonder
no
says
i
again
and
clenching
my
hands
no
never
why
true
says
she
more
softly
methinks
in
your
heart
is
no
room
for
poor
love
is
of
hate
and
hate
is
a
disease
incurable
with
you
not
so
martin
yes
no
nay
how
should
i
know
quoth
i
yet
should
love
befall
you
upon
a
day
be
love
unworthy
any
good
woman
martin
why
then
says
i
god
keep
me
from
the
folly
of
love
pray
rather
that
love
of
its
infinite
wisdom
teach
you
the
folly
of
hate
martin
is
a
truth
says
i
bitterly
a
truth
that
hath
become
part
of
me
it
hath
been
my
companion
in
solitude
my
comfort
in
my
shameful
misery
my
hope
my
very
life
or
i
had
died
else
and
now
now
you
bid
me
forget
it
as
some
mere
whimsy
some
idle
fancy
this
thought
that
hath
made
me
strong
to
endure
such
shames
and
tribulations
as
few
have
been
forced
to
suffer
aye
i
do
i
do
she
cried
for
your
own
sake
martin
and
for
mine
no
quoth
i
a
thousand
times
this
thought
hath
been
life
to
me
and
only
with
life
may
i
forego
it
at
this
the
busy
fingers
faltered
in
their
pretty
labour
and
bowing
her
head
upon
her
hand
she
sat
her
face
hid
from
me
until
i
not
doubting
that
she
wept
grew
uneasy
and
questioned
her
at
last
nay
my
lady
since
this
must
be
so
wherefore
grieve
grieve
says
she
lifting
her
head
and
i
saw
her
eyes
all
radiant
and
her
red
lips
in
a
smile
nay
martin
i
do
marvel
how
eloquent
you
grow
upon
your
wrongs
indeed
is
as
though
you
feared
you
might
forget
them
thus
do
you
spur
up
slothful
memory
which
giveth
me
sure
hope
that
one
day
sleep
to
wake
no
more
and
now
or
ever
i
might
find
answer
she
rose
and
giving
me
was
gone
singing
to
her
bed
and
i
full
of
bewilderment
but
suddenly
as
i
sat
thus
staring
into
the
dying
fire
she
was
back
again
what
now
i
questioned
our
goat
martin
i
may
not
sleep
until
i
know
her
safe
come
let
us
go
look
and
speaking
she
reached
me
her
hand
so
i
arose
and
thus
with
her
soft
warm
fingers
in
mine
we
went
amid
the
shadows
where
i
had
tethered
the
goat
to
a
tree
hard
beside
the
murmurous
rill
and
found
the
animal
lying
secure
and
placidly
enough
the
kid
beside
her
the
which
sight
seemed
to
please
my
lady
mightily
but
is
shame
the
poor
mother
should
go
tied
always
thus
could
you
not
make
a
picket
fence
martin
and
she
should
have
some
refuge
against
the
storms
to
the
which
i
agreed
thus
as
we
went
back
we
fell
to
making
plans
one
project
begetting
another
and
we
very
blithe
about
it
chapter
xxxv
how
my
dear
lady
was
lost
to
me
and
now
followed
a
season
of
much
hard
work
each
day
bringing
its
varied
tasks
and
we
right
joyous
in
our
labour
so
that
ofttimes
i
would
hear
her
singing
away
in
her
sweet
voice
merry
as
any
grig
or
find
myself
whistling
lustily
to
the
tap
of
my
hammer
and
now
indeed
my
saw
and
all
rusty
though
it
was
served
me
faithfully
and
well
and
my
carpentry
went
forward
apace
during
this
time
also
we
added
four
goats
and
six
kids
to
our
flock
so
that
we
had
good
store
of
milk
and
having
with
my
lady
help
made
our
net
with
strands
of
cord
knotted
crosswise
we
caught
therewith
great
plenty
of
fish
remembering
my
adventure
with
the
indian
i
furnished
myself
with
a
good
stout
pike
and
a
couple
of
javelins
moreover
i
set
up
divers
marks
like
rovers
and
every
day
i
would
shoot
at
these
with
my
bow
so
that
i
soon
became
so
dexterous
i
could
bring
down
a
bird
on
the
wing
six
times
out
of
seven
though
in
teaching
myself
this
proficiency
i
lost
four
of
my
indian
arrows
beyond
recovery
thus
sped
the
time
all
too
quickly
but
with
each
day
came
a
greater
understanding
and
a
deeper
amity
betwixt
my
lady
and
me
now
much
and
very
much
might
i
set
down
here
concerning
this
my
sweet
comrade
her
many
noble
qualities
and
how
as
our
fellowship
lengthened
i
that
was
a
man
selfish
beyond
thought
finding
her
unselfish
always
and
uncomplaining
seeing
her
so
brave
in
the
face
of
adversity
and
indomitable
to
overcome
all
difficulty
yet
ever
and
always
a
woman
gracious
and
tender
i
by
my
very
reverence
for
her
sweet
womanhood
became
in
some
sense
a
better
man
i
might
tell
how
when
my
black
moods
took
me
the
mere
sight
of
her
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
touch
of
her
hand
nay
her
very
nearness
was
enough
to
dispel
them
i
might
paint
to
your
imagination
the
way
her
hair
curled
at
her
temples
the
trick
she
had
of
biting
her
nether
lip
when
at
all
put
out
of
the
jut
of
her
pretty
chin
when
angered
then
the
sweet
vibrant
softness
of
her
voice
her
laughter
the
wonder
of
her
changing
moods
all
these
i
would
dilate
upon
if
i
might
since
is
joy
to
me
but
lest
i
prove
wearisome
i
will
hasten
on
to
the
finding
of
black
bartlemy
treasure
of
all
that
led
up
to
it
and
all
those
evils
that
followed
after
it
and
this
bringeth
me
to
a
time
whenas
we
sat
she
and
i
eating
our
breakfast
and
the
world
all
radiant
with
a
young
sun
says
she
if
my
calculations
be
right
should
be
a
new
moon
and
i
am
glad
for
i
do
love
the
moon
aye
but
how
should
you
judge
this
says
i
wondering
because
i
have
kept
a
record
martin
a
stroke
for
each
day
and
a
cross
for
every
sunday
excellent
quoth
i
then
you
will
know
how
long
we
have
lived
here
two
months
and
five
days
martin
so
long
a
time
says
i
amazed
hath
it
seemed
so
very
long
she
questioned
no
indeed
says
i
no
and
there
the
marvel
is
no
marvel
martin
you
have
been
too
full
of
business
to
heed
time
let
us
reckon
up
what
we
have
achieved
thus
far
first
of
all
a
stool
for
me
hairpins
says
i
a
spoon
martin
and
shoes
for
me
lamps
and
candles
quoth
i
a
table
martin
a
fishing
line
and
two
hooks
two
armchairs
martin
a
cupboard
and
a
press
a
churn
says
i
you
are
forgetting
our
five
pipkins
martin
true
says
i
and
clumsy
things
they
are
but
very
useful
sir
next
a
and
a
bed
for
me
here
is
fine
achievement
martin
are
you
not
proud
to
have
wrought
so
much
and
with
so
little
but
there
is
much
yet
to
do
quoth
i
so
much
the
better
says
she
thus
far
i
am
well
content
and
happy
i
demanded
aye
martin
are
you
now
at
this
i
fell
to
profound
reverie
and
she
also
and
this
the
subject
of
my
musings
in
every
man
and
woman
born
into
this
world
as
it
doth
seem
to
me
god
putteth
some
of
his
infinite
self
whereby
all
things
are
possible
in
degree
greater
or
smaller
for
to
the
god
within
us
all
things
are
possible
is
our
very
humanity
that
limits
our
potentialities
confidence
in
this
power
within
us
is
a
mighty
aid
to
all
endeavour
whereby
we
our
coward
flesh
notwithstanding
may
attempt
great
things
and
though
being
human
we
ofttimes
fail
yet
this
very
effort
strengthens
and
ennobles
us
who
art
thou
cries
flesh
to
adventure
thing
so
great
and
above
thy
puny
strength
to
perform
who
art
thou
i
am
god
answers
since
finite
man
am
i
only
by
reason
of
thee
base
coward
flesh
thus
to
my
thinking
in
every
man
is
angel
and
demon
each
striving
each
for
the
soul
of
him
whereby
he
doeth
evil
or
good
according
to
the
which
of
these
twain
he
aideth
to
victory
howbeit
thus
it
is
with
me
i
being
despite
my
seeming
slowness
of
quick
and
passionate
temper
and
of
such
desperate
determination
that
once
set
on
a
course
needs
would
i
pursue
it
though
it
led
to
my
own
confounding
and
destruction
for
now
indeed
i
wrought
that
the
which
brought
on
my
lady
great
sorrow
and
grievous
peril
and
on
myself
shame
bloodshed
and
a
black
despair
and
this
the
manner
of
it
are
you
not
happy
martin
says
she
happy
and
proud
to
have
accomplished
so
much
with
so
little
no
says
i
and
so
that
she
blenched
from
me
for
look
now
says
i
clenching
my
fist
here
have
we
wrought
and
slaved
together
day
in
and
day
out
and
to
what
end
that
we
may
live
to
our
comfort
says
she
a
little
breathlessly
and
to
what
end
i
demanded
to
what
purpose
have
you
cozened
me
to
labour
thus
i
i
do
understand
you
martin
says
she
unsteadily
here
you
cast
alone
with
me
on
this
island
is
a
man
says
you
to
yourself
i
a
lonely
woman
so
must
i
keep
him
busy
his
mind
ever
employed
on
some
labour
no
matter
what
lest
peradventure
he
make
love
to
me
stop
cries
she
angrily
leaping
up
to
her
feet
all
in
a
moment
for
shame
martin
conisby
you
wrong
me
and
yourself
i
am
your
comrade
nay
you
are
a
woman
very
subtle
and
as
you
are
beautiful
so
have
you
kept
me
in
ploy
thus
yearning
meanwhile
for
some
ship
anything
to
bear
you
safe
away
from
me
often
have
i
seen
you
staring
seaward
and
praying
for
a
sail
o
you
lie
martin
you
lie
ah
have
i
not
trusted
you
aye
as
one
might
a
tiger
by
humouring
me
and
distracting
my
attention
all
these
weeks
i
have
scarce
touched
you
and
kissed
you
never
nor
had
i
thought
to
but
now
by
god
martin
o
martin
what
would
you
kiss
you
says
i
savagely
and
caught
her
wrists
nay
that
you
shall
never
do
with
that
look
on
your
face
cries
she
and
twisted
so
strongly
as
nigh
broke
my
hold
but
despite
all
her
desperate
striving
struggle
how
she
might
i
dragged
her
to
me
pinning
her
arms
in
my
cruel
embrace
but
still
she
withstood
me
and
with
such
fury
of
strength
that
twice
we
staggered
and
came
near
falling
until
all
at
once
she
yielded
and
lay
all
soft
her
breath
coming
in
little
pitiful
panting
groans
so
i
kissed
her
as
i
would
her
hair
her
eyes
her
parted
lips
her
cool
soft
throat
until
sun
and
trees
and
green
grass
seemed
to
spin
and
whirl
dizzily
about
me
until
my
lips
were
wet
with
her
salt
tears
o
god
o
god
she
whispered
o
martin
that
i
trusted
so
will
you
kill
my
faith
and
trust
will
you
shame
your
comrade
you
that
i
loved
loved
says
i
catching
my
breath
and
staring
down
at
her
lashes
loved
me
o
damaris
aye
loved
and
honoured
you
above
all
men
until
the
beast
broke
loose
and
now
cried
i
hoarsely
and
now
what
speak
god
pity
loose
me
martin
and
now
what
tell
me
hate
now
scorn
and
contempt
as
was
aboard
ship
o
martin
let
me
go
she
sobbed
answer
me
is
it
hate
henceforth
yes
she
panted
yes
and
tore
herself
from
my
hold
but
as
she
turned
to
fly
me
i
caught
her
back
to
me
and
madman
that
i
was
bent
her
backward
across
my
knee
that
i
might
look
down
into
her
eyes
and
meeting
my
look
she
folded
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
closing
her
eyes
spoke
broken
and
humbled
take
take
your
will
of
me
black
bartlemy
i
am
not
brave
enough
to
stab
you
as
she
did
now
at
this
i
shivered
and
must
needs
cast
my
gaze
towards
that
great
pimento
tree
that
towered
afar
off
so
then
my
hateful
dream
had
come
true
and
now
i
knew
myself
for
black
a
rogue
as
ever
bartlemy
had
been
so
i
loosed
her
and
starting
up
stood
staring
across
the
desolation
of
ocean
o
damaris
says
i
at
last
here
in
my
belt
was
my
knife
to
your
hand
better
you
had
stabbed
me
indeed
and
i
dying
would
have
kissed
your
feet
after
the
manner
of
yon
dead
rogue
as
it
is
i
must
live
hating
myself
for
having
destroyed
the
best
the
sweetest
thing
life
could
offer
me
and
that
your
trust
but
o
my
lady
says
i
looking
down
where
she
knelt
her
face
bowed
upon
her
hands
i
do
love
you
reverently
and
beyond
my
life
even
greatly
enough
to
forego
your
vengeance
she
questioned
softly
and
without
glancing
up
god
help
me
cried
i
how
may
i
forget
the
oath
i
swore
on
my
father
grave
you
broke
your
oath
to
me
says
she
never
stirring
so
do
i
know
that
true
love
hath
not
touched
you
think
of
me
as
you
will
quoth
i
but
i
know
says
she
raising
her
head
at
last
and
looking
up
at
me
i
am
sure
martin
where
hate
is
true
love
can
never
be
and
love
howsoever
vehement
is
gentle
and
reverent
and
being
of
god
a
very
holy
thing
but
you
have
made
of
it
a
thing
of
passion
merciless
and
cruel
is
love
debased
so
will
i
get
hence
says
i
for
since
i
have
destroyed
your
faith
how
shall
you
ever
sleep
again
and
know
yourself
secure
and
such
rogue
as
i
near
you
i
go
damaris
i
away
and
take
your
fears
along
with
me
then
the
while
she
watched
me
dumbly
i
slung
my
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
about
me
set
the
hatchet
in
my
girdle
and
taking
my
pike
turned
to
go
but
checking
my
haste
went
into
the
cave
she
following
me
silent
always
and
taking
the
pistol
from
where
it
hung
examined
flint
and
priming
and
charge
and
laid
it
on
the
table
should
you
need
me
at
any
time
shoot
off
this
pistol
and
i
will
come
says
i
so
my
lady
but
scarce
was
i
without
the
cave
than
she
comes
to
me
with
my
in
her
hands
and
when
i
would
have
none
of
it
grew
the
more
insistent
put
it
on
says
she
gently
who
can
tell
what
may
befall
you
so
put
it
on
i
pray
thus
in
the
end
i
donned
it
though
with
ill
grace
which
done
i
took
my
pike
across
my
shoulder
and
strode
away
and
when
i
had
gone
some
distance
i
glanced
back
and
saw
her
standing
where
i
had
left
her
watching
me
and
with
her
hands
clasped
tight
together
martin
says
she
o
and
vanished
into
the
gloom
of
the
cave
as
for
me
i
strode
on
at
speed
and
careless
of
direction
for
my
mind
was
a
whirl
of
conflicting
thoughts
and
a
bitter
rage
against
myself
thus
went
i
a
goodish
while
and
and
so
at
last
found
myself
lost
amidst
mazy
thickets
and
my
pike
very
troublesome
howbeit
i
presently
gained
more
open
ways
and
went
at
speed
though
whither
i
cared
not
the
sun
was
westering
when
coming
out
from
the
denser
woods
i
saw
before
me
that
high
hill
whose
rocky
summit
dominated
the
island
and
bent
my
steps
thitherward
and
then
all
in
a
moment
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
i
stood
still
for
borne
to
me
on
the
soft
air
came
a
sudden
sharp
sound
and
though
faint
with
distance
i
knew
it
for
the
report
of
a
firearm
at
this
sound
an
overwhelming
great
joy
and
gratitude
surged
within
me
since
thus
of
her
infinite
mercy
my
lady
had
summoned
me
back
and
now
as
i
retraced
my
steps
full
of
thankfulness
i
marvelled
to
find
my
eyes
and
myself
all
trembling
eagerness
to
behold
her
loveliness
again
to
hear
her
voice
mayhap
to
touch
her
hand
indeed
i
felt
as
we
had
been
parted
a
year
rather
than
a
brief
hour
and
now
i
got
me
to
dreaming
how
i
should
meet
her
and
how
she
would
greet
me
she
should
find
a
new
martin
i
told
myself
suddenly
these
deluding
dreams
were
shivered
to
horrible
fear
and
myself
brought
sweating
to
a
standstill
by
another
sound
that
smote
me
like
a
blow
for
i
knew
this
for
the
report
of
a
musket
for
a
moment
i
stood
leaning
on
my
pike
as
one
dazed
then
the
hateful
truth
of
it
seized
me
and
i
began
to
run
like
any
madman
headlong
i
went
bursting
my
way
through
tangled
vines
and
undergrowth
heedless
of
the
thorns
that
gashed
me
cursing
such
obstacles
as
stayed
me
now
thorny
tangles
now
pausing
to
beat
me
a
way
with
my
pikestaff
running
at
breathless
speed
whenever
i
might
until
having
taken
a
wrong
direction
in
my
frenzy
i
came
out
amid
those
vines
and
bushes
that
bordered
the
lake
of
the
waterfall
and
right
over
against
the
great
rock
i
have
mentioned
but
from
where
i
was
the
place
being
high
i
could
see
over
and
beyond
this
rock
and
as
i
stood
panting
and
spent
mighty
distraught
and
my
gaze
bent
thitherward
i
shivered
despite
the
sweat
that
streamed
from
me
with
sudden
awful
chill
for
from
those
greeny
depths
i
heard
a
scream
wild
and
heartrending
and
knowing
this
voice
grew
sick
and
faint
and
sank
weakly
to
my
knees
and
now
i
heard
vile
laughter
then
hoarse
shouts
and
forth
of
the
underbrush
opposite
broke
a
wild
piteous
figure
all
rent
and
torn
yet
running
very
fleetly
as
i
watched
cursing
my
helplessness
she
tripped
and
fell
but
was
up
again
all
in
a
moment
yet
too
late
for
then
i
saw
her
struggling
in
the
clasp
of
a
ragged
fellow
and
with
divers
other
men
running
towards
them
and
now
madness
seized
me
indeed
for
between
us
was
the
lake
and
though
my
bow
was
strung
and
ready
i
dared
not
shoot
lest
i
harm
her
thus
as
i
watched
in
an
agony
at
my
impotence
my
lady
broke
her
captor
hold
and
came
running
and
he
and
his
fellows
hard
after
her
straight
for
the
rock
she
came
and
being
there
stood
a
moment
to
stare
about
her
like
the
piteous
hunted
creature
she
was
martin
she
cried
o
martin
and
uttering
this
dolorous
cry
and
or
ever
i
might
answer
she
tossed
wild
arms
to
heaven
and
plunged
over
and
down
i
saw
her
body
strike
the
water
in
a
clean
dive
and
vanish
into
those
dark
and
troubled
deeps
and
with
breath
in
check
and
glaring
eyes
waited
for
her
to
reappear
i
heard
vague
shouts
and
cries
where
her
pursuers
watched
for
her
likewise
but
i
heeded
them
nothing
staring
ever
and
waiting
waiting
but
these
gloomy
waters
gave
no
sign
and
so
at
last
my
breath
burst
from
me
in
a
bitter
sobbing
groan
one
by
one
the
minutes
dragged
by
until
i
thought
my
brain
must
crack
for
nowhere
was
sign
of
that
beloved
shape
and
then
all
at
once
i
knew
she
must
be
dead
this
sweet
innocent
slain
thus
before
my
eyes
snatched
out
of
life
and
lost
forever
to
me
for
all
time
lost
to
me
beyond
recovery
at
last
i
turned
my
haggard
burning
eyes
upon
her
murderers
four
of
them
there
were
and
all
staring
into
those
cruel
black
waters
below
and
not
a
word
betwixt
them
suddenly
the
man
snapped
his
fingers
and
laughed
even
as
my
bowstring
twanged
then
i
saw
him
leap
backwards
screaming
with
pain
his
shoulder
transfixed
by
my
arrow
immediately
and
ere
i
might
shoot
again
his
fellows
dragged
him
down
and
lying
prone
on
their
bellies
let
fly
wildly
in
my
direction
with
petronel
and
musquetoon
and
now
had
i
been
near
enough
i
would
have
leaped
upon
them
to
slay
and
be
slain
since
life
was
become
a
hateful
thing
as
it
was
crouched
there
the
leaves
i
watched
them
crawl
from
the
rock
dragging
their
hurt
comrade
with
them
then
seeing
them
stealing
off
thus
a
mighty
rage
filled
me
ousting
all
other
emotion
and
my
bow
in
one
hand
and
pike
in
the
other
i
started
running
in
pursuit
but
my
great
pike
proving
i
cast
it
away
that
i
might
go
the
faster
trusting
rather
to
my
five
arrows
and
the
knife
in
my
girdle
and
the
thought
of
this
knife
and
its
deadly
work
at
close
quarters
heartened
me
mightily
as
i
ran
yet
in
a
while
the
passion
of
my
anger
subsiding
grief
took
its
place
again
and
a
hopeless
desolation
beyond
words
so
ran
i
blinded
by
scalding
tears
and
my
heart
breaking
within
me
and
thus
came
i
to
a
place
of
rocks
and
looking
not
to
my
feet
it
chanced
that
i
fell
and
striking
my
head
against
a
rock
knew
no
more
and
lost
in
a
blessed
unconsciousness
forgot
awhile
the
anguish
of
my
breaking
heart
chapter
xxxvi
telleth
some
part
of
a
night
of
agony
when
at
last
i
opened
my
eyes
i
found
myself
in
a
place
of
gloom
and
very
stiff
and
sore
therefore
i
lay
where
i
was
nor
sought
to
move
little
by
little
as
i
lay
thus
sleep
and
wake
i
was
aware
of
a
pallid
glow
all
about
me
and
lifting
heavy
head
saw
the
moon
low
down
in
the
sky
like
a
great
golden
sickle
and
staring
up
at
this
of
a
sudden
back
rushed
memory
and
with
it
my
hopeless
misery
for
now
i
remembered
how
but
a
few
short
hours
since
my
dear
lady
had
prophesied
this
new
moon
hereupon
crouching
there
my
aching
head
bowed
upon
my
hands
i
gave
myself
up
to
my
despair
and
a
corroding
grief
beyond
all
comforting
from
where
i
crouched
i
might
look
down
upon
this
accursed
lake
a
misty
horror
of
gloomy
waters
and
beholding
this
i
knew
that
my
gentle
patient
comrade
was
gone
from
me
that
somewhere
within
those
black
and
awful
depths
her
tender
body
was
lying
she
was
dead
her
sweet
voice
for
ever
hushed
she
that
had
been
so
vitally
alive
and
remembering
all
her
pretty
ways
i
grew
suddenly
all
blind
with
tears
and
casting
myself
down
lay
a
great
while
sobbing
and
groaning
until
i
could
weep
no
more
at
last
sitting
up
i
wondered
to
find
my
head
so
painful
and
putting
up
my
hand
found
my
face
all
wet
and
sticky
with
blood
that
flowed
from
a
gash
in
my
hair
and
remembering
how
i
had
fallen
and
the
reason
of
my
haste
i
started
up
and
forthwith
began
seeking
my
knife
and
hatchet
and
presently
found
them
hard
by
where
i
had
tripped
now
standing
thus
knife
in
one
hand
and
hatchet
in
the
other
i
turned
to
look
down
upon
these
dark
and
evil
waters
goodbye
my
lady
says
i
fare
thee
well
sweet
comrade
before
dawn
we
will
meet
again
i
pray
and
shalt
know
me
for
truer
man
and
better
than
i
seemed
so
turning
my
back
on
the
lake
i
went
to
seek
my
vengeance
on
her
destroyers
and
death
at
their
hands
an
it
might
be
so
in
a
while
i
came
to
that
torrent
where
the
water
flowed
out
from
the
lake
its
bed
strewn
with
tumbled
rocks
and
easy
enough
to
cross
the
water
being
less
in
volume
by
reason
of
the
dry
weather
all
at
once
i
stopped
for
amid
these
rocks
and
boulders
i
saw
caught
all
manner
of
drift
as
sticks
and
bushes
branches
and
the
like
washed
down
by
the
current
and
which
all
tangled
and
twisted
together
choked
this
narrow
defile
forming
a
kind
of
barrier
against
the
current
now
as
i
gazed
at
this
my
eyes
as
if
directed
by
the
finger
of
god
beheld
something
caught
in
this
barrier
something
small
and
piteous
to
see
but
which
set
me
all
and
sent
me
clambering
down
these
rocks
and
reaching
out
shaking
hand
i
took
up
that
same
pin
i
had
carved
and
wrought
for
her
hair
thus
stood
i
to
view
this
through
my
blinding
tears
and
to
kiss
and
kiss
it
many
times
over
because
it
had
known
her
better
than
i
but
all
at
once
i
thrust
this
precious
relic
into
my
bosom
and
stared
about
me
with
new
and
awful
expectation
for
the
current
which
had
brought
this
thing
would
bring
more
so
i
began
to
seek
among
these
rocks
where
the
stream
ran
fast
and
in
each
pool
and
shallow
and
once
sweating
and
shivering
stooped
to
peer
at
something
that
gleamed
white
from
a
watery
hollow
and
gasped
my
relief
to
find
it
was
no
more
than
a
stone
none
the
less
sought
i
with
a
prayer
on
my
lips
dreading
to
find
that
white
and
tender
body
mangled
by
the
cruel
rocks
yet
searching
feverishly
none
the
less
long
i
stayed
there
until
the
moon
sent
down
her
tender
beam
as
though
to
aid
me
but
of
this
time
i
will
write
no
more
since
even
now
it
is
a
misery
to
recall
at
last
i
that
knew
myself
a
man
about
to
die
turned
me
towards
our
habitation
those
rocks
she
had
called
home
and
reaching
the
plateau
i
stood
still
swept
alternately
by
grief
and
passion
to
see
this
our
refuge
all
desecrated
by
vile
hands
our
poor
furniture
scattered
without
the
cave
and
presently
i
espied
her
stool
standing
where
she
had
been
wont
to
sit
to
watch
and
cheer
me
at
my
labour
coming
thither
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
laying
my
head
thereon
wetted
this
unlovely
thing
with
my
tears
and
kissed
it
many
times
as
i
lay
thus
much
that
she
had
done
and
said
little
things
forgot
till
now
rushed
upon
my
memory
her
sweet
calm
presence
seemed
all
about
me
soothing
away
the
passion
of
my
grief
and
in
this
hour
that
was
to
end
my
miserable
life
i
knew
at
last
that
i
had
loved
her
purely
and
truly
from
the
first
and
with
such
love
as
might
have
lifted
me
to
heaven
and
kneeling
thus
i
spake
aloud
to
this
her
sweet
presence
that
seemed
to
hover
about
me
o
damaris
beloved
as
thou
to
shame
hast
chosen
death
in
death
i
follow
thee
trusting
to
a
merciful
god
that
i
may
find
thee
again
then
uprising
from
my
knees
i
came
out
from
the
shadows
and
standing
in
the
moon
radiance
looked
heedfully
to
the
edge
of
my
axe
and
with
it
gripped
in
my
hand
went
out
to
find
death
chapter
xxxvii
how
i
sought
death
but
found
it
not
beyond
deliverance
sands
i
saw
the
glow
of
their
fire
and
drawing
thither
knew
them
camped
in
the
shadow
of
that
great
pimento
tree
and
within
that
rocky
gorge
the
which
had
afforded
my
dear
lady
and
me
our
first
night
shelter
being
come
thither
i
sat
me
down
and
took
counsel
how
best
to
attack
them
that
i
might
slay
as
many
as
possible
ere
they
gave
me
the
death
i
hungered
for
and
the
end
of
it
was
i
began
to
scale
the
cliff
my
goatskin
buskins
soundless
and
very
sure
amid
the
rocks
as
i
mounted
i
heard
the
hoarse
murmur
of
their
voices
and
knew
by
their
very
intonation
since
i
could
hear
no
words
as
yet
that
they
were
speaking
english
reaching
the
summit
and
mighty
cautious
i
came
where
i
might
look
down
into
the
cleft
they
lay
sprawled
about
their
fire
four
fellows
ragged
and
unkempt
three
of
them
talking
together
and
one
who
lay
groaning
ever
and
anon
be
damned
joel
for
a

a
great
bony
fellow

wait
till

as

death
gasped
humphrey
here
for
you
first
and
whipping
out
a
knife
he
made
a
fierce
thrust
at
the
speaker
but
the
others
closed
with
him
then
as
they
strove
together
panting
and
cursing
i
rose
to
come
at
them
but
the
wounded
man
chancing
to
lift
his
head
saw
me
where
i
stood
the
moonlight
on
my
bloody
face
and
uttered
a
hoarse
scream
death
cries
he
is
on
us
mates
look
look
yonder
death
and
wounds
yonder
he
comes
for
all
of
us
o
mates
look
yon
death
for
all
on
us
but
in
this
moment
i
leaped
down
upon
them
from
above
sending
one
man
sprawling
and
scattering
their
fire
and
whirling
sparks
and
smoke
within
this
dim
we
fought
with
a
merciless
fury
and
desperation
beyond
words
a
pistol
flashed
and
roared
and
then
another
as
i
leapt
with
whirling
axe
and
darting
knife
i
remember
a
wild
of
random
blows
voices
that
shouted
hoarse
blasphemies
screams
and
groans
a
whirl
of
vicious
arms
of
hands
that
clutched
once
i
reeled
to
a
knife
flashed
and
stabbed
beneath
my
arm
but
twice
i
got
home
with
my
knife
and
once
a
man
sobbed
and
went
down
beneath
my
hatchet
and
then
they
were
running
and
i
after
them
but
i
had
taken
a
scathe
in
my
leg
and
twice
i
fell
thus
they
reached
their
boat
with
some
hundred
yards
to
spare
and
i
saw
their
frantic
struggles
to
launch
it
as
i
staggered
after
them
but
ere
i
could
reach
them
they
had
it
afloat
and
tumbled
aboard
then
came
i
panting
curses
and
plunged
into
the
sea
wading
after
them
up
to
my
middle
and
so
near
that
aiming
a
blow
at
one
of
them
i
cut
a
great
chip
from
the
gunwale
but
reeling
from
the
blow
of
an
oar
sank
to
my
knees
and
a
wave
breaking
over
me
bore
me
backward
choking
thus
when
i
found
my
feet
again
they
were
well
away
and
plying
their
oars
lustily
whiles
i
roaring
and
shouting
stood
to
watch
them
until
the
boat
was
lost
in
the
distance
now
as
i
stood
thus
raging
bitterly
at
my
impotence
i
bethought
me
that
i
had
seen
but
three
men
run
and
turning
about
hasted
back
to
deal
with
the
fourth
reaching
the
scene
of
the
struggle
i
came
on
the
man
humphrey
outstretched
upon
his
back
in
the
moonlight
and
his
face
shorn
asunder
seeing
him
thus
so
horribly
dead
i
went
aside
and
fell
to
scrubbing
my
hatchet
blade
and
haft
with
the
cleanly
sand
then
came
i
and
grasping
this
thing
had
been
named
humphrey
i
dragged
it
the
sands
and
hove
it
forthwith
into
the
sea
standing
thereafter
to
watch
it
borne
out
on
the
receding
tide
now
as
i
watched
thus
came
a
wave
that
lifted
the
thing
so
that
this
dead
man
seemed
to
rise
up
and
wave
an
arm
to
me
ere
he
vanished
this
done
and
i
yet
alive
i
took
to
wandering
aimlessly
hither
and
thither
and
chancing
into
the
rocky
cleft
found
lying
three
muskets
and
four
pistols
with
bandoliers
together
with
a
knife
and
a
couple
of
swords
these
i
set
orderly
together
and
so
wandered
away
again
all
this
night
i
rambled
about
thus
and
dawn
found
me
seated
bartlemy
tree
staring
at
the
ocean
yet
seeing
it
not
so
god
had
refused
my
appeal
it
seemed
i
could
not
die
and
presently
chancing
to
look
down
at
myself
in
the
growing
light
i
understood
the
reason
for
here
was
i
armed
in
my
shirt
of
mail
forgotten
till
now
and
scowling
down
at
this
i
saw
its
fine
steel
links
scratched
and
scored
by
many
blows
and
bedaubed
here
and
there
with
blood
so
then
thinks
i
was
she
had
saved
me
alive
and
in
this
thought
found
me
some
small
solace
hereupon
i
arose
and
went
down
to
the
sea
limping
by
reason
of
my
hurt
an
ugly
gash
above
my
knee
being
minded
to
wash
from
me
the
grime
and
smears
that
fouled
me
but
or
ever
i
reached
the
water
i
stopped
for
there
more
hateful
in
sun
than
moonlight
lay
that
ghastly
thing
that
had
been
humphrey
there
he
lay
cast
up
by
the
tide
and
now
with
every
wave
that
broke
he
stirred
gently
and
moved
arms
and
legs
in
wanton
silly
fashion
and
nodding
with
his
shattered
head
as
in
mockery
of
me
so
i
went
and
seizing
hold
upon
the
thing
swung
it
upon
my
back
and
thus
burdened
climbed
out
upon
the
reef
and
with
mighty
trouble
for
my
strength
seemed
oozing
out
of
me
reaching
a
place
at
last
where
the
water
ran
deep
i
paused
and
with
sudden
painful
effort
whirled
the
thing
above
my
head
and
hove
it
far
out
where
splashing
it
fell
with
sullen
plunge
and
vanished
from
my
sight
but
even
so
i
was
possessed
of
sudden
uneasy
feeling
that
the
thing
had
turned
on
me
and
was
swimming
back
to
shore
so
that
drawing
my
knife
i
must
needs
sit
there
awhile
to
watch
if
this
were
so
indeed
at
last
i
arose
but
being
come
to
deliverance
sands
whirled
suddenly
about
expectant
to
behold
that
dead
thing
uprising
from
the
surge
to
flap
derisive
arms
at
me
and
this
did
i
many
times
being
haunted
thus
all
that
day
and
for
many
weary
hours
thereafter
by
this
dead
man
humphrey
presently
as
i
went
heedless
of
all
direction
and
the
sun
very
hot
i
began
to
stagger
in
my
gait
and
to
mutter
her
name
to
myself
and
presently
to
shouting
it
until
the
cliffs
gave
back
my
cries
and
the
hollow
caves
murmured
damaris
o
damaris
and
now
was
a
mist
all
about
me
wherein
dim
forms
moved
mocking
me
and
ever
and
anon
methought
to
behold
my
lady
but
dim
and
very
far
removed
from
me
so
that
sometimes
i
ran
and
i
fell
to
moaning
and
shedding
weak
and
impotent
tears
truly
a
black
and
evil
day
for
me
this
whereof
i
have
but
a
vague
memory
save
only
of
pain
a
hopeless
weariness
and
intolerable
thirst
thus
it
was
sunset
when
i
found
myself
once
more
upon
that
grassy
plateau
creeping
on
hands
and
knees
though
how
i
came
thither
i
knew
not
i
remember
drinking
from
the
little
rill
and
staggering
within
the
cave
there
to
fall
and
lie
filling
the
place
with
my
lamentations
and
cry
of
damaris
o
damaris
i
remember
a
patch
of
silver
light
a
radiance
that
crept
across
the
gloom
and
of
dreaming
my
lady
beside
me
as
of
old
and
of
babbling
of
love
and
forgiveness
of
pain
and
heartbreak
whiles
i
watched
the
beam
of
light
creeping
nigh
me
upon
the
floor
until
sobbing
and
moaning
yet
gazing
ever
upon
this
light
i
saw
grow
upon
it
a
sudden
dark
shape
that
moved
heard
a
rustle
behind
me
a
footstep
a
cry
and
knowing
this
for
the
man
humphrey
come
upon
me
at
last
in
my
weakness
i
strove
to
rise
to
turn
and
face
him
but
finding
this
vain
cried
out
upon
him
for
murderer
was
you
killed
her
my
love
the
very
soul
of
me
was
you
humphrey
that
are
dead
come
that
i
may
slay
you
again
then
feeling
his
hands
upon
me
i
strove
to
draw
my
knife
but
could
not
and
groaned
and
so
knowledge
passed
from
me
chapter
xxxviii
concerning
the
dead
man
humphrey
and
how
i
saw
a
vision
in
the
moonlight
my
next
memory
was
of
sun
and
a
dance
of
leafy
shadows
on
the
wall
of
the
cave
the
which
shadows
held
my
attention
so
that
i
had
no
will
to
look
otherwhere
for
these
were
merry
shadows
that
leapt
in
sportive
gambols
that
danced
and
swayed
pleasing
me
mightily
and
as
i
watched
these
antic
shadows
i
could
hear
the
pleasant
murmur
of
the
little
rill
without
the
cave
that
bubbled
with
sweet
soft
noises
like
small
babbling
voices
and
brake
ever
and
anon
into
elfin
laughter
and
presently
mingled
with
this
pretty
babblement
i
seemed
to
hear
a
whisper
martin
dear
martin
and
now
i
saw
my
lady
plunge
to
death
from
the
rock
and
started
up
filling
the
place
with
my
lamentations
until
for
very
weakness
i
lay
hushed
and
heard
again
the
soft
rippling
of
the
brook
and
therewith
her
voice
very
sweet
and
faint
and
far
away
martin
dear
martin
i
remember
a
season
of
blackness
in
which
evil
things
menaced
me
and
a
horror
of
dreams
wherein
i
fettered
and
fast
bound
must
watch
my
sweet
lady
struggle
weeping
in
the
arms
of
vile
rogues
whiles
i
strove
desperately
to
break
my
bonds
and
finding
this
vain
fell
to
raging
madness
and
dashed
myself
hither
and
thither
to
slay
myself
and
end
my
torment
or
axe
in
hand
amid
smoke
and
flame
i
fell
upon
her
murderers
then
would
i
smite
down
the
man
humphrey
only
for
him
to
rise
to
be
smitten
again
and
yet
again
nodding
shattered
head
and
flapping
nerveless
arms
in
derision
of
me
until
knowing
i
might
never
slay
him
he
being
already
dead
i
turned
to
flee
but
with
him
ever
behind
me
and
in
my
ears
his
sobbing
cry
of
death
for
all
of
us
death
and
feeling
his
hands
on
me
i
would
fall
to
desperate
struggle
until
the
blackness
closed
over
me
again
thick
and
stifling
like
a
sea
and
behind
all
these
horrors
was
a
haunting
knowledge
that
i
was
going
mad
that
this
man
humphrey
was
waiting
for
me
out
beyond
the
surf
beckoning
to
me
with
flapping
arms
and
had
cast
on
me
a
spell
whereby
as
my
brain
shrivelled
to
madness
my
body
was
shrivelling
and
changing
into
that
of
black
bartlemy
always
i
knew
that
humphrey
waited
me
beyond
the
reef
watchful
for
my
coming
and
growing
ever
more
querulous
and
eager
as
the
spell
wrought
on
me
so
that
he
began
to
call
to
me
in
strange
sobbing
voice
hailing
me
by
my
new
name
bartlemy
ahoy
black
bartlemy
bartlemy
ho
come
your
ways
to
humphrey
that
being
dead
can
die
no
more
and
knowing
all
doth
know
you
for
bartlemy
crept
back
from
hell
so
come
bartlemy
come
and
be
as
i
am
and
there
others
here
proper
lads
as
wants
ye
too
dead
men
all
by
the
rope
by
the
knife
by
the
bullet
oho
there
be
two
at
the
fore
at
the
main
be
three
more
dead
men
that
swing
all
of
a
row
here
fine
dainty
meat
for
the
fishes
to
eat
black
bartlemy
bartlemy
ho
there
a
fine
spanish
dame
joanna
her
name
must
follow
wherever
ye
go
till
your
black
heart
shall
feel
your
own
cursed
steel
black
bartlemy
bartlemy
ho
and
i
hearkening
to
this
awful
sobbing
voice
sweating
and
shivering
in
the
dark
knew
that
since
i
was
indeed
black
bartlemy
sooner
or
later
i
must
go
thus
it
befell
that
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
dazzled
by
a
fierce
sun
supporting
me
against
a
rock
and
my
breath
coming
in
great
gasps
and
in
a
while
my
eyes
growing
stronger
i
stared
away
to
the
reef
where
this
man
humphrey
waited
me
with
his
dead
men
all
and
since
i
must
needs
go
there
i
wept
because
it
was
so
far
off
now
as
i
stood
grieving
thus
i
saw
one
stand
below
me
on
deliverance
looking
also
towards
the
reef
a
woman
tall
and
very
stately
and
habited
in
gown
of
rich
satin
and
embroidery
caught
in
at
slender
waist
with
golden
girdle
and
about
her
head
a
scarf
of
lace
and
this
woman
stood
with
bowed
head
and
hands
as
one
that
grieved
also
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
lifted
folded
hands
to
the
cloudless
heaven
in
passionate
supplication
and
beholding
her
face
i
knew
her
for
the
poor
spanish
lady
imploring
just
heaven
for
vengeance
on
me
that
had
been
her
undoing
and
uttering
a
great
cry
i
sank
on
my
knees
mercy
o
god
mercy
let
me
not
be
mad
yet
even
as
i
prayed
i
knew
that
madness
was
upon
me
ere
i
plunged
again
into
the
dreadful
dark
but
god
whose
mercy
is
infinite
hearkened
to
my
distressful
cry
for
in
a
while
he
brought
me
up
from
that
black
abyss
and
showed
me
two
marvels
the
which
filled
me
with
wonder
and
a
sudden
passionate
hope
and
the
first
was
the
bandage
that
swathed
my
thigh
and
this
of
itself
enough
to
set
my
poor
wits
in
a
maze
of
speculation
for
this
bandage
was
of
linen
very
fine
and
delicate
such
as
i
knew
was
not
to
be
found
upon
the
whole
island
yet
here
was
it
bound
about
my
hurt
plain
and
manifest
and
set
there
by
hands
in
such
kindly
work
and
my
second
wonder
was
a
silver
beaker
or
ewer
very
artfully
wrought
and
all
chased
and
embossed
with
designs
of
fruit
and
flower
and
of
a
rare
craftsmanship
and
this
jug
set
within
my
reach
and
of
milk
the
better
to
behold
this
i
raised
myself
and
with
infinite
labour
but
now
and
suddenly
she
was
before
me
again
this
poor
spanish
lady
i
had
slain
upon
a
time
wherefore
i
blenched
and
shrank
from
her
coming
but
she
falling
upon
her
knees
sought
to
clasp
me
in
her
arms
crying
words
i
heeded
not
as
maugre
my
weakness
i
strove
wildly
to
hold
her
off
i
am
bartlemy
that
killed
you
says
i
i
am
black
bartlemy
they
know
out
yonder
beyond
the
reef
hark
and
you
shall
hear
how
they
hail
me
o
kind
god
teach
me
how
i
may
win
him
back
to
knowledge
so
crying
this
spanish
lady
of
a
sudden
unpinned
her
hair
and
shook
its
glossy
ripples
all
about
her
look
martin
cries
she
do
you
know
me
o
do
you
know
me
now
i
am
joan
come
back
to
you
no
says
i
no
damaris
is
dead
and
lost
i
saw
her
die
then
who
am
i
martin
the
spanish
lady
or
one
of
the
ghosts
do
haunt
me
but
now
her
hands
were
clasping
mine
her
soft
hair
all
about
me
as
she
stooped
and
feeling
these
hands
so
warm
and
vital
so
quick
and
strong
with
life
i
began
to
tremble
and
strove
against
her
no
longer
and
so
she
stooped
above
me
that
i
might
feel
her
sweet
breath
on
fevered
cheek
and
brow
is
your
damaris
martin
says
she
her
tears
falling
fast
is
your
comrade
hath
come
back
to
comfort
you
now
seeing
how
i
stared
all
trembling
and
amazed
she
set
her
arms
about
me
and
drawing
me
to
her
bosom
clasped
me
there
and
my
head
pillowed
thus
i
fell
but
these
tears
were
tears
of
joy
and
thankfulness
beyond
all
words
o
damaris
quoth
i
at
last
if
this
be
death
i
care
not
since
i
have
seen
thee
again
why
martin
says
she
weeping
with
me
art
indeed
so
glad
so
glad
to
find
again
thy
poor
comrade
and
thus
knowing
myself
forgiven
a
great
joy
sang
within
me
chapter
xxxix
how
my
dear
lady
came
back
to
me
i
was
sitting
in
one
of
our
armchairs
amid
the
leafy
shade
watching
her
knead
dough
with
her
two
pretty
fists
to
this
end
she
had
rolled
up
the
sleeves
of
her
splendid
gown
and
thus
i
hearkening
to
her
story
must
needs
stare
at
her
soft
round
arms
and
yearn
mightily
to
kiss
their
velvety
smoothness
and
instantly
myself
therefor
shifted
my
gaze
from
these
temptations
to
my
own
unlovely
figure
contrasting
myself
and
my
worn
garments
with
her
rich
attire
and
proud
and
radiant
beauty
she
was
again
the
great
lady
and
far
removed
above
such
poor
wretch
as
i
for
all
her
pitiful
tenderness
and
so
when
i
plunged
from
the
rock
she
was
saying
i
never
thought
to
see
this
dear
place
again
or
the
blessed
sun
and
i
sank
o
deep
deep
then
martin
i
seemed
to
be
caught
in
some
current
far
down
there
in
the
darkness
that
whirled
and
tossed
me
and
swept
me
up
behind
the
torrent
and
in
the
rock
was
a
great
cavern
sloping
to
the
water
and
there
this
current
threw
me
all
breathless
and
nigh
dead
martin
god
be
thanked
says
i
fervently
and
there
i
lay
all
night
martin
very
sick
and
fearful
when
day
came
i
saw
this
great
cave
opened
into
a
smaller
and
this
into
yet
another
so
i
came
to
a
passage
in
the
rock
and
because
there
was
none
other
way
for
me
i
followed
this
and
then
o
martin
what
quoth
i
leaning
forward
have
you
ever
been
to
the
palace
at
versailles
martin
once
as
a
boy
with
my
father
well
martin
the
cave
the
hall
i
came
to
at
last
was
more
splendid
than
any
versailles
can
show
and
then
i
knew
that
i
had
found
black
bartlemy
treasure
ha
quoth
i
and
is
it
indeed
so
great
beyond
description
says
she
clasping
her
floury
hands
and
turning
on
me
with
shining
eyes
i
have
held
in
my
hands
jewels
o
by
the
handful
great
pearls
and
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
sapphires
beyond
price
aye
i
nodded
but
was
this
all
all
martin
says
she
staring
why
according
to
adam
there
should
be
all
manner
of
stores
says
i
powder
and
shot
tools
a
carpenter
chest
they
are
all
there
with
provisions
of
every
kind
as
witness
this
flour
martin
but
i
heeded
only
these
wondrous
jewels
hereupon
she
turns
to
her
work
again
describing
to
me
the
splendour
of
these
precious
stones
and
the
wonder
of
bartlemy
treasure
whiles
i
viewing
her
loveliness
would
have
given
such
foolish
treasure
a
thousand
times
for
but
her
little
finger
as
watching
the
play
of
her
round
arms
again
i
fell
whereupon
she
turns
all
anxious
questioning
doth
your
wound
trouble
you
martin
nay
indeed
says
i
shaking
my
head
i
am
very
well
i
thank
you
then
wherefore
sigh
so
deep
and
oft
i
am
a
vasty
fool
are
you
martin
why
but
in
place
of
answer
i
rose
and
coming
beside
her
scowled
to
see
the
tender
flesh
of
her
arms
all
black
and
bruised
what
is
this
i
demanded
nought
to
matter
who
did
it
you
martin
in
your
raving
you
were
very
strong
mistaking
me
for
the
poor
spanish
lady
o
forgive
me
i
cried
and
stooping
to
this
pretty
arm
would
have
touched
my
lips
thereto
for
mere
pity
but
checked
myself
fearing
to
grieve
her
perceiving
this
she
comes
a
little
nearer
you
may
an
you
so
desire
martin
says
she
though
is
all
floury
so
i
kissed
her
arm
tenderly
and
very
reverently
as
it
had
been
some
holy
thing
as
indeed
so
i
thought
it
i
glad
was
i
did
this
comrade
glad
martin
aye
i
had
rather
was
myself
than
yon
evil
rogues
nay
forget
them
says
i
seeing
her
shiver
plague
on
me
for
reminding
you
hush
martin
why
then
forget
them
and
i
have
their
weapons
to
cope
with
should
they
return
now
thank
god
cries
she
clasping
my
hand
in
both
of
hers
thank
god
martin
i
feared
you
had
killed
them
all
why
i
did
my
best
i
sighed
shaking
my
head
but
they
were
too
strong
for
me
would
to
god
i
had
indeed
slain
hush
martin
o
hush
and
here
she
claps
her
pretty
hand
to
my
lips
where
i
straightway
it
to
my
kisses
though
truly
says
she
the
whiles
this
was
from
your
raving
i
feared
them
all
slain
at
your
hand
so
do
i
rejoice
to
know
you
innocent
of
their
deaths
here
her
hand
released
she
fell
albeit
a
little
tremulously
to
see
my
face
all
patched
with
flour
and
so
back
to
her
labour
but
martin
says
she
turning
to
glance
at
me
in
a
while
you
must
be
very
terrible
to
drive
away
these
four
great
men
and
very
brave
here
was
no
bravery
quoth
i
methought
you
surely
dead
and
i
meant
them
to
slay
me
also
did
you
miss
me
so
greatly
she
questioned
and
not
looking
at
me
yes
you
fought
them
in
skeleton
cove
beyond
deliverance
martin
aye
you
found
their
guns
there
and
the
sand
all
trampled
and
hatefully
stained
is
an
evil
place
martin
and
so
it
is
says
i
but
as
to
these
weapons
there
were
two
good
firelocks
i
mind
and
besides
they
are
all
here
martin
guns
and
swords
and
pistols
you
raved
for
them
in
your
sickness
so
i
fetched
them
while
you
slept
though
indeed
you
have
no
need
of
these
there
be
weapons
of
every
sort
in
the
treasure
cave
is
like
an
arsenal
ha
with
good
store
of
powder
and
shot
comrade
yes
martin
how
many
weeks
have
i
lain
sick
comrade
nay
was
only
four
days
at
this
i
fell
to
marvelling
that
so
much
of
agony
might
be
endured
in
so
little
time
and
you
tended
me
damaris
why
to
be
sure
martin
and
so
saved
my
life
so
i
pray
may
it
be
a
life
lived
to
noble
purpose
martin
and
now
i
sat
awhile
very
thoughtful
and
watched
her
shape
the
dough
into
little
cakes
and
set
them
to
bake
i
must
contrive
you
an
oven
and
this
at
once
says
i
when
you
are
strong
again
martin
nay
i
well
thanks
to
your
care
of
me
and
truly
be
wonderful
to
eat
bread
again
but
i
warned
you
i
had
no
yeast
says
she
looking
at
me
a
little
anxiously
nay
sir
why
must
you
smile
is
strange
to
see
you
at
such
labour
and
clad
so
vastly
fine
indeed
sir
needs
must
this
your
go
bedight
like
any
queen
since
nought
is
there
in
black
bartlemy
treasure
that
is
not
sumptuous
and
splendid
have
you
no
desire
to
behold
these
wonders
for
yourself
not
a
tittle
says
i
but
martin
three
months
are
nigh
sped
and
master
penfeather
not
come
and
according
to
his
letter
of
this
great
treasure
is
yours
why
then
my
lady
i
do
freely
bestow
it
on
you
nay
this
have
i
taken
already
because
i
needed
it
look
so
saying
she
drew
a
comb
from
her
hair
and
showed
me
how
it
was
all
fashioned
of
wrought
gold
and
set
with
great
gems
pearls
and
sapphires
and
rubies
marvellous
to
see
is
mighty
handsome
quoth
i
and
beyond
price
i
judge
and
yet
says
she
i
would
rather
have
my
wooden
pin
in
its
stead
for
surely
there
was
none
like
to
it
in
all
this
world
hereupon
groping
in
my
pocket
i
brought
out
that
pin
i
had
carved
for
her
beholding
which
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
glad
surprise
and
letting
fall
her
golden
comb
took
the
pin
to
turn
it
this
way
and
that
viewing
it
as
it
had
been
the
very
wonder
of
the
world
rather
than
the
poor
thing
it
was
why
martin
says
she
at
last
why
martin
where
found
you
this
so
i
told
her
and
though
my
words
were
lame
and
halting
i
think
she
guessed
somewhat
of
the
agony
of
that
hour
for
i
felt
her
hand
touch
my
shoulder
like
a
caress
death
shadow
hath
been
over
us
of
late
martin
says
she
and
hath
made
us
wiser
methinks
death
says
i
is
mayhap
but
the
beginning
of
a
greater
life
wherein
shall
be
no
more
partings
i
pray
is
a
sweet
thought
martin
and
you
have
never
feared
death
says
i
aye
but
i
do
martin
i
do
cries
she
i
am
grown
craven
these
days
mayhap
yet
you
sought
death
because
there
was
no
other
way
martin
but
when
death
clutched
at
me
from
those
black
depths
i
agonised
for
life
is
life
then
become
so
sweet
to
you
damaris
yes
martin
says
she
softly
since
when
i
questioned
since
when
but
instead
of
answering
she
falls
softly
and
keeping
her
back
to
me
thus
i
saw
that
she
had
set
the
pin
back
in
her
hair
whereat
i
grew
all
suddenly
and
beyond
reason
glad
though
indeed
the
thing
accorded
but
ill
with
her
fine
gown
as
i
told
her
forthwith
think
you
so
martin
says
she
gravely
but
with
a
dimple
in
her
cheek
i
do
is
manifestly
out
of
keeping
with
your
your
pleats
tags
lappets
galoons
and
the
rest
o
almost
seem
you
do
not
like
me
thus
says
she
frowning
down
at
her
finery
but
with
the
dimple
showing
plainer
than
ever
why
truly
says
i
stooping
to
take
up
the
jewelled
comb
where
it
lay
i
liked
your
ragged
gown
better
because
your
own
clothes
are
so
worn
and
sorry
sir
is
time
you
had
better
i
must
see
to
it
nay
never
trouble
be
joy
says
she
sweetly
but
setting
her
chin
at
me
and
then
good
lack
your
hair
martin
what
of
it
all
and
then
your
beard
what
o
my
beard
so
wild
and
shaggy
and
is
so
completely
out
o
the
mode
mode
says
i
frowning
mode
martin
your
spade
beard
was
then
came
your
dagger
or
stiletto
and
now
hum
says
i
it
may
be
your
broadsword
or
for
aught
i
care
but
as
to
yon
gown
alas
poor
thing
soon
look
worn
and
ragged
as
you
can
wish
martin
i
have
already
lost
three
pearl
studs
and
should
grieve
for
them
were
there
not
a
coffer
full
of
better
that
i
wot
of
o
martin
when
i
think
of
all
these
wonders
these
great
diamonds
emeralds
sapphires
pearls
and
rubies
i
do
tingle
and
can
these
toys
so
please
you
says
i
yes
cries
she
yes
and
so
would
they
any
other
that
was
not
a
stock
or
a
stone
or
martin
conisby
who
is
above
such
vanities
vanities
indeed
says
i
in
this
wilderness
more
especially
how
if
we
should
find
the
world
again
hum
says
i
but
this
powder
and
shot
now
pho
cries
she
and
stamping
her
foot
turns
her
back
on
me
here
am
i
yearning
to
show
you
all
these
hidden
marvels
martin
but
i
never
will
until
you
beg
me
no
never
and
now
is
time
you
took
your
medicine
what
medicine
i
questioned
wondering
is
a
soothing
draught
i
have
decocted
from
some
of
my
simples
it
will
make
you
sleep
but
i
have
no
mind
to
sleep
is
why
you
must
drink
your
potion
never
in
this
world
says
i
mighty
determined
why
yes
you
will
dear
martin
says
she
gently
but
setting
her
dimpled
chin
at
me
i
go
fetch
it
and
away
she
goes
forthwith
and
is
presently
back
bearing
an
embossed
cup
like
unto
a
little
porringer
and
of
gold
curiously
ornamented
here
is
a
noble
cup
says
i
in
these
secret
caves
martin
is
nothing
that
is
not
beautiful
the
walls
are
all
hung
with
rich
arras
the
floors
adorned
with
marvellous
rugs
and
carpets
and
there
are
many
pictures
excellent
well
painted
pirate
and
wicked
as
he
was
black
bartlemy
understood
and
loved
beautiful
things
aye
he
did
so
says
i
scowling
and
amongst
these
pictures
is
one
of
himself
how
should
you
know
this
because
were
you
shaven
martin
this
might
pass
for
picture
of
you
though
to
be
sure
your
expression
is
different
except
when
you
scowl
as
you
do
now
sir
come
take
your
medicine
like
a
good
martin
and
here
she
sets
the
cup
to
my
lips
no
says
i
yes
martin
is
sleep
you
need
and
sleep
you
shall
have
for
indeed
i
do
long
to
hear
you
at
work
again
and
whistling
so
drink
it
for
my
sake
martin
indeed
is
none
so
very
bitter
so
in
the
end
i
swallowed
the
stuff
to
be
done
with
it
and
in
a
while
sure
enough
i
grew
drowsy
and
limping
into
the
cave
stared
to
behold
my
bed
no
longer
a
heap
of
bracken
but
a
real
bed
with
sheets
and
pillows
such
indeed
as
i
had
not
slept
in
for
many
a
long
day
thus
instead
of
throwing
myself
down
all
dressed
as
i
had
been
minded
i
laid
aside
my
rough
clothes
lest
they
soil
this
dainty
gear
and
getting
into
bed
joyed
in
the
feel
of
these
cool
white
sheets
and
closing
my
eyes
fell
to
dreamless
slumber
chapter
xl
of
clothes
i
awoke
late
next
morning
to
find
my
clothes
clean
gone
and
others
in
their
place
but
garments
these
whose
like
i
had
never
seen
for
here
were
purple
breeches
and
ribbanded
at
the
knee
and
buttoning
there
with
great
gold
buttons
six
a
side
and
each
set
with
a
great
pearl
a
fine
cambric
shirt
a
doublet
cut
in
at
the
waist
with
lappets
the
sleeves
slashed
and
very
wide
and
turned
up
at
the
wrists
with
and
this
wondrous
garment
fastening
in
front
with
many
gold
buttons
all
set
with
goodly
pearls
so
that
i
judged
this
coat
to
be
a
very
fortune
in
itself
besides
this
i
found
a
great
lace
collar
or
falling
band
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
shoes
with
gold
buckles
set
with
diamonds
and
a
great
penthouse
of
a
hat
adorned
with
a
curling
feather
fastened
by
a
diamond
brooch
whiles
hard
by
was
an
embroidered
carrying
a
long
rapier
its
guards
and
quillons
of
wrought
gold
its
pommel
flaming
with
great
brilliants
beholding
all
of
which
gauds
and
fopperies
i
vowed
none
of
them
and
cowering
beneath
the
sheets
fell
to
shouting
and
hallooing
for
my
lady
but
finding
this
vain
scowled
at
these
garments
instead
they
were
of
a
fashion
such
as
i
remembered
my
father
had
worn
and
now
as
i
gazed
on
them
a
strange
fancy
took
me
to
learn
how
i
that
had
gone
so
long
and
in
rags
might
feel
in
such
sumptuous
apparel
so
up
i
got
and
dressed
forthwith
and
found
this
a
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
what
with
the
unfamiliar
shape
of
these
garments
and
their
numberless
points
and
buttons
howbeit
was
done
at
last
and
now
coming
without
the
cave
there
was
my
lady
upon
her
stool
preparing
breakfast
beholding
me
she
stared
for
a
moment
then
rose
smiling
roguishly
and
sank
down
in
a
slow
and
gracious
curtsey
good
morrow
to
your
lordship
says
she
your
lordship
called
i
think
but
i
could
not
answer
your
lordship
shouts
since
i
was
busied
preparing
your
lordship
breakfast
now
beholding
all
the
sweet
and
roguish
witchery
of
her
the
sun
so
bright
and
the
world
about
us
so
joyous
what
could
i
do
but
smile
and
sweeping
off
my
great
hat
make
her
as
deep
and
profound
a
reverence
as
ever
was
seen
at
whitehall
or
versailles
madame
quoth
i
your
ladyship
most
humble
and
very
obedient
servant
i
trust
your
ladyship
hath
breakfast
ready
for
of
a
truth
my
magnificence
is
mighty
sharp
set
o
martin
cries
she
clapping
her
hands
i
vow
was
most
gallant
it
needeth
but
for
you
to
trim
your
hair
and
beard
no
i
think
i
will
have
you
mind
me
of
the
boyish
martin
of
years
ago
yes
you
shall
shave
shave
quoth
i
staring
like
any
fool
yes
martin
i
have
all
things
ready
come
it
shall
not
take
you
long
we
will
breakfast
when
you
are
shaved
and
trimmed
so
she
brings
me
back
to
the
cave
and
presently
comes
bearing
a
box
wherein
lay
razors
with
soap
and
everything
needful
to
a
fine
gentleman
toilet
then
she
sets
before
me
a
mirror
and
taking
a
pair
of
scissors
at
her
bidding
i
began
to
clip
the
hair
from
my
face
but
so
bungled
the
business
that
she
presently
took
the
scissors
and
did
it
for
me
thereafter
i
shaved
awkwardly
enough
and
she
mighty
anxious
lest
i
cut
myself
the
which
i
did
and
having
at
last
washed
and
dried
my
face
i
stood
all
amazed
to
find
myself
so
much
now
seeing
how
she
stared
at
me
and
with
rosy
lips
all
i
smiled
then
wondered
to
behold
her
eyes
suddenly
with
tears
o
martin
you
do
look
the
same
martin
after
all
says
she
and
so
away
into
the
sunshine
yet
when
i
presently
joined
her
i
found
her
blithe
enough
are
you
hungry
sir
ravenous
my
lady
why
then
here
we
have
broiled
fish
caught
by
my
ladyship
salt
martin
butter
churned
by
my
ladyship
and
bread
martin
bread
baked
by
my
ladyship
own
two
hands
o
marvellous
sweet
lady
says
i
and
is
none
so
ill
though
i
had
no
yeast
is
it
martin
delicious
says
i
my
mouth
full
and
now
all
our
recent
woes
and
sorrows
clean
forgotten
a
right
joyous
meal
had
we
our
hearts
light
as
the
sweet
air
that
breathed
around
us
and
untroubled
as
the
placid
ocean
and
broad
serenity
of
heaven
with
no
dark
shadow
anywhere
to
warn
us
of
those
evils
to
come
thus
we
ate
and
talked
finding
joy
in
everything
often
my
fingers
must
go
to
feel
my
smooth
cheeks
and
chin
and
she
catching
me
must
needs
laugh
and
vow
a
smooth
face
suited
me
well
and
that
i
should
be
handsome
were
my
nose
another
shape
and
my
eyes
a
different
colour
thus
as
i
say
brooding
sorrow
seemed
clean
vanished
from
my
world
so
that
my
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
for
that
i
should
live
to
breathe
the
air
she
made
sweet
breakfast
done
i
fetched
my
saw
and
despite
her
remonstrances
and
my
resplendent
breeches
forthwith
set
about
making
a
cupboard
vowing
i
was
well
again
that
i
never
felt
better
etc
hereupon
finding
me
set
on
it
she
presently
brings
me
the
following
an
excellent
new
saw
divers
chisels
of
goodly
edge
a
plane
a
hammer
an
auger
and
an
adze
the
which
rejoiced
me
greatly
more
especially
the
adze
the
which
is
an
exceeding
useful
tool
in
skilled
hands
all
these
she
had
brought
from
the
secret
store
and
i
mighty
grateful
therefor
and
told
her
so
why
then
martin
says
she
if
your
gratitude
be
real
and
true
you
shall
do
somewhat
for
me
what
you
will
says
i
eagerly
nay
she
laughed
is
no
more
than
this
keep
you
shaved
henceforth
and
so
it
was
agreed
chapter
xli
of
the
voice
that
sang
on
deliverance
sands
if
clothes
be
the
outward
and
visible
albeit
silent
expression
of
a
man
his
tastes
and
certain
attitudes
of
his
mind
yet
have
they
of
themselves
a
mighty
influence
on
their
wearer
being
as
it
were
an
inspiration
to
him
in
degree
more
or
less
and
this
is
truth
i
will
maintain
let
say
who
will
to
the
contrary
since
is
so
my
experience
teacheth
me
hitherto
my
ragged
shirt
my
rough
leathern
jerkin
and
sailor
breeches
had
been
a
constant
reminder
of
the
poor
desperate
rogue
i
had
become
my
wild
hair
and
shaggy
beard
evidences
of
slavedom
thus
i
had
been
indeed
what
i
had
seemed
in
looks
a
rude
ungentle
creature
expectant
of
scorns
and
and
therefore
very
prone
to
fight
and
quarrel
bitter
of
speech
and
in
all
circumstances
sullen
ungoverned
and
very
desperate
but
now
seeing
myself
thus
gently
dight
my
wild
hair
tamed
by
comb
and
scissors
there
grew
within
me
a
new
respect
for
my
manhood
so
that
little
by
little
those
evils
that
slavery
had
wrought
slipped
from
me
thus
though
i
still
laboured
at
my
carpentry
and
such
business
as
was
to
do
yet
the
fine
linen
rolled
high
above
my
scarred
and
knotted
arm
put
me
to
the
thought
that
i
was
no
longer
the
poor
wild
wretch
full
of
despairing
rage
against
fate
her
cruel
dealings
but
rather
a
man
gently
born
and
therefore
one
who
must
endure
all
things
as
uncomplainingly
as
might
be
and
one
moreover
who
to
greater
or
less
degree
was
master
of
his
own
fate
and
now
came
hope
that
most
blessed
and
beneficent
spirit
that
lifteth
the
fallen
from
the
slough
that
bindeth
up
the
broken
heart
that
cheereth
the
sad
and
downcast
and
maketh
the
bold
and
courageous
to
attempt
fortune
yet
again
o
thou
that
we
call
hope
thou
sweet
bright
angel
of
god
without
thee
life
were
an
evil
unendurable
with
thee
for
companion
gloomy
doubt
sullen
fear
and
dark
despair
flee
utterly
away
and
we
patient
and
undismayed
by
any
dangers
or
difficulties
may
realise
our
dreams
at
last
o
sweet
strong
angel
of
god
with
thee
to
companion
us
all
things
are
possible
thus
every
morning
came
hope
to
greet
me
on
my
waking
and
i
forgetting
the
futile
past
began
to
look
forward
to
a
future
more
glorious
than
i
had
ever
dreamed
so
i
from
a
sullen
rogue
full
of
black
humours
grew
to
know
again
the
joy
of
laughter
and
put
off
my
ungracious
speech
and
ways
with
my
rough
attire
though
how
much
the
change
thus
wrought
in
me
was
the
work
of
my
sweet
comrade
these
pages
i
do
think
will
show
as
for
my
lady
she
very
quick
to
mark
this
change
grew
ever
the
more
kind
and
trusting
sharing
with
me
all
her
doubts
and
perplexities
thus
did
some
problem
vex
her
she
must
come
to
me
biting
her
pretty
lips
and
her
slender
brows
wrinkled
to
ask
my
advice
at
this
time
and
at
her
suggestion
i
builded
a
fireplace
and
oven
within
our
third
or
inmost
cave
that
was
by
turns
her
larder
stillroom
dairy
and
kitchen
and
with
a
chimney
to
carry
off
the
smoke
the
which
i
formed
of
clay
and
large
pebbles
and
found
it
answer
very
well
thus
what
with
those
things
i
contrived
and
others
she
brought
from
her
the
secret
whereof
she
kept
mighty
close
we
lacked
for
nothing
to
our
comfort
even
as
adam
had
promised
in
his
letter
moreover
i
was
very
well
armed
both
for
offence
and
defence
for
one
by
one
she
brought
me
the
following
pieces
a
spanish
helmet
inlaid
with
gold
and
very
cumbersome
a
back
and
breast
of
fine
steel
of
proof
four
arquebuses
curiously
chased
and
gilded
with
shot
and
powder
for
the
same
three
brace
of
pistols
and
very
accurate
and
what
with
these
my
sword
axe
and
trusty
knife
i
felt
myself
capable
to
drive
away
any
should
dare
molest
us
be
he
indian
buccaneer
or
pirate
as
i
told
her
aye
but
says
she
whiles
you
fought
for
our
lives
what
must
i
be
doing
lying
secure
within
your
secret
never
says
she
setting
her
chin
at
me
o
never
martin
since
i
am
your
comrade
my
place
must
be
beside
you
but
distress
me
and
spoil
my
shooting
why
then
my
aim
should
be
truer
martin
come
now
teach
me
how
to
use
gun
and
pistol
so
then
and
there
i
fetched
a
pistol
and
one
of
the
arquebuses
and
showed
her
their
manage
namely
how
to
hold
them
to
level
sight
etc
next
i
taught
her
how
to
charge
them
how
to
wad
powder
and
then
shot
lest
the
ball
roll
out
of
the
barrel
how
having
primed
she
must
be
careful
ever
to
close
the
pan
against
the
priming
being
blown
away
all
of
the
which
she
was
mighty
quick
to
apprehend
moreover
i
took
care
to
keep
all
my
firearms
cleaned
and
loaded
that
i
might
be
ready
for
any
disturbers
of
our
peace
so
the
days
sped
each
with
its
meed
of
work
but
each
of
joy
and
dear
to
me
beyond
expressing
is
the
memory
of
those
days
whenas
i
labouring
with
my
new
tools
had
but
to
lift
my
head
to
behold
my
dear
comrade
herself
busy
as
i
truly
how
dear
how
the
memory
of
it
all
a
memory
this
indeed
that
was
to
become
for
me
sacred
beyond
all
others
for
now
came
happiness
with
arms
outstretched
to
me
and
i
poor
blind
wretch
suffered
it
to
plead
in
vain
and
pass
me
by
as
you
shall
hear
it
was
a
night
of
splendour
with
a
full
moon
uprising
in
majesty
to
fill
the
world
with
her
soft
radiance
a
night
very
warm
and
still
and
we
silent
i
think
because
of
the
tender
beauty
of
the
night
martin
says
my
companion
softly
at
last
here
is
another
day
sped
alas
and
more
the
pity
quoth
i
o
says
she
looking
at
me
askance
our
days
fly
all
too
fast
damaris
here
is
a
time
i
fain
would
linger
upon
an
i
might
it
hath
been
a
very
wonderful
time
truly
martin
and
hath
taught
me
very
much
we
are
both
the
better
for
it
i
think
and
you
what
of
me
comrade
i
questioned
as
she
paused
you
are
grown
so
much
gentler
since
your
sickness
so
much
more
my
dear
friend
and
companion
why
is
all
your
doing
damaris
i
am
glad
o
very
glad
says
she
almost
in
a
whisper
why
is
you
who
have
taught
me
to
to
love
all
good
sweet
things
to
rule
myself
that
i
i
may
some
day
mayhap
be
a
little
more
worthy
of
of
here
beginning
to
flounder
i
came
to
sudden
halt
and
casting
about
in
my
mind
for
a
likely
phrase
saw
her
regarding
me
the
dimple
in
her
cheek
but
her
eyes
all
compassionate
and
ineffably
tender
dear
man
says
she
and
reached
me
her
hand
damaris
says
i
heavily
and
looking
down
at
these
slender
fingers
yet
not
daring
to
kiss
them
lest
my
passion
sweep
me
away
you
know
that
i
do
love
you
yes
martin
and
that
my
love
be
it
what
it
may
is
yet
an
honest
love
yes
dear
martin
here
was
silence
a
while
she
looking
up
at
the
moon
and
i
at
her
i
broke
my
oath
to
you
once
says
i
nor
will
i
swear
again
but
dear
my
lady
know
this
though
i
do
hunger
and
thirst
for
you
yet
mine
is
such
reverent
love
that
should
we
live
thus
together
long
years
aye
until
the
end
of
our
lives
i
will
school
myself
to
patience
and
wait
ever
upon
your
will
though
be
hard
says
i
my
teeth
thrilling
to
the
sudden
clasp
of
her
fingers
but
martin
says
she
softly
how
if
our
days
together
here
should
all
suddenly
end
end
cries
i
starting
wherefore
end
when
why
end
and
i
trembled
in
a
sick
panic
at
the
mere
possibility
end
quoth
i
again
would
you
have
an
end
no
ah
no
says
she
leaning
to
me
that
i
could
look
down
into
her
eyes
doth
this
o
damaris
can
this
mean
that
you
are
happy
with
me
in
this
solitude
content
so
happy
martin
so
content
that
i
do
fear
lest
it
may
all
suddenly
end
and
vanish
like
some
loved
dream
damaris
o
damaris
says
i
kissing
her
sweet
fingers
look
now
there
is
question
hath
oft
been
on
my
lips
yet
one
i
have
it
dared
to
ask
ask
me
now
martin
is
this
could
it
might
it
perchance
be
possible
you
should
learn
with
time
mayhap
to
love
me
a
little
nay
not
a
little
not
gently
nor
with
reason
but
fiercely
mightily
beyond
the
cramping
bounds
of
all
reason
now
here
she
laughed
a
small
sad
laugh
with
no
mirth
in
it
and
leaned
her
brow
against
my
arm
as
one
very
weary
o
foolish
martin
she
sighed
how
little
you
have
seen
how
little
guessed
how
little
you
know
the
real
me
for
i
am
a
woman
martin
as
you
are
a
man
and
joy
in
it
all
these
months
i
have
watched
you
growing
back
to
your
nobler
self
i
have
seen
you
strive
with
yourself
for
my
sake
and
gloried
in
your
victories
though
sometimes
i
have
tempted
you
just
a
little
martin
nay
wait
dear
martin
at
night
i
have
known
you
steal
forth
and
hearkened
to
your
step
going
to
and
fro
out
in
the
dark
and
getting
to
my
knees
have
thanked
god
for
you
martin
was
not
all
in
vain
then
says
i
hoarsely
bethinking
me
of
the
agony
of
those
sleepless
nights
vain
she
cried
vain
is
for
this
i
do
honour
you
honour
me
says
i
wincing
above
all
men
martin
is
for
this
i
wait
says
i
fronting
her
all
shamefaced
i
do
love
you
so
greatly
i
would
not
have
you
dream
me
better
than
i
am
so
now
must
i
tell
you
this
i
stole
to
you
once
at
midnight
you
were
asleep
the
moonlight
all
about
you
and
looked
like
an
angel
of
god
and
now
it
was
my
turn
to
stare
up
at
the
moon
whiles
i
waited
miserably
enough
for
her
answer
and
when
you
went
away
martin
says
she
at
last
when
i
heard
you
striding
to
and
fro
out
here
beneath
god
stars
i
knew
that
yours
was
the
greatest
noblest
love
in
all
the
world
you
saw
me
yes
martin
yet
your
eyes
were
fast
shut
yes
but
not
not
all
the
time
and
o
martin
dear
dear
martin
i
saw
your
great
strong
arms
reach
out
to
take
me
but
they
did
they
did
because
true
love
is
ever
greatly
merciful
and
your
triumph
was
mine
also
martin
and
so
it
is
i
love
you
worship
you
and
needs
must
all
my
days
and
now
we
were
on
our
feet
her
hands
in
mine
eyes
staring
into
eyes
and
never
award
to
speak
is
it
true
says
i
at
last
god
damaris
is
it
true
seems
it
so
wonderful
dear
martin
why
this
love
of
mine
reacheth
back
through
the
years
to
sir
martin
my
little
and
hath
grown
with
the
years
till
now
it
filleth
me
and
the
universe
about
me
have
you
forgot
was
your
picture
hung
opposite
my
bed
at
home
your
sword
i
kept
bright
because
it
had
been
yours
and
often
martin
here
on
our
dear
island
i
have
wept
sometimes
for
love
of
you
because
it
pained
me
so
nay
wait
beloved
first
let
me
speak
though
i
do
yearn
for
your
kisses
but
this
night
is
the
greatest
ever
was
or
mayhap
ever
shall
be
and
we
alone
here
in
the
wild
do
lie
beyond
all
human
laws
soever
save
those
of
our
great
love
and
o
martin
you
you
do
love
me
now
when
i
would
have
answered
i
could
not
so
i
sank
to
my
knees
and
stooping
ere
she
knew
clasped
and
kissed
the
pretty
feet
of
her
no
martin
beloved
ah
no
cries
she
as
it
were
pain
to
her
and
kneeling
before
me
set
her
soft
arms
about
my
neck
martin
says
she
as
we
kneel
thus
in
this
wilderness
alone
with
god
here
and
now
before
your
lips
touch
mine
before
your
dear
strong
hands
take
me
to
have
and
hold
forever
so
great
and
trusting
is
my
love
i
ask
of
you
no
pledge
but
this
swear
now
in
god
sight
to
renounce
and
put
away
all
thought
of
vengeance
now
and
for
ever
swear
this
martin
now
i
all
bemused
by
words
so
unexpected
all
dazzled
as
it
were
by
the
pleading
passionate
beauty
of
her
closed
my
eyes
that
i
might
think
give
me
until
i
groaned
be
too
late
choose
now
martin
let
me
think
is
no
time
for
thought
choose
martin
this
hour
shall
never
come
again
so
martin
speak
now
or
the
words
died
on
her
lip
her
eyes
opened
in
sudden
dreadful
amaze
and
thus
we
remained
kneeling
rigid
in
one
another
arms
for
away
across
deliverance
deep
and
full
and
clear
a
voice
was
singing
there
are
two
at
the
fore
at
the
main
are
three
more
dead
men
that
swing
all
in
a
row
here
fine
dainty
meat
for
the
fishes
to
eat
black
bartlemy
bartlemy
ho
chapter
xlii
concerning
the
song
of
a
dead
man
long
after
the
singing
was
died
away
i
like
one
dazed
could
think
of
nought
but
this
accursed
song
these
words
the
which
had
haunted
my
and
methought
no
more
than
the
outcome
of
my
own
fevered
imagination
thus
my
mind
running
on
this
and
very
full
of
troubled
perplexity
i
suffered
my
lady
to
bring
me
within
our
refuge
but
with
my
ears
on
the
stretch
as
expectant
to
hear
again
that
strange
deep
voice
sing
these
words
i
had
heard
chanted
by
a
dead
man
in
my
dreams
being
come
within
our
third
cave
or
kitchen
my
lady
shows
me
a
small
cord
that
dangled
in
certain
shadowy
corner
and
pulling
on
this
cord
down
falls
a
and
hangs
suspended
and
i
knew
this
for
adam
ladder
of
cords
whereby
he
had
been
wont
to
mount
into
his
fourth
and
secret
cavern
as
mentioned
in
his
chronicle
here
lieth
safety
martin
says
my
lady
for
as
master
penfeather
writes
in
his
journal
resolute
man
lying
upon
the
hidden
up
yonder
withstand
a
whole
army
so
long
as
his
shot
last
and
you
are
very
resolute
and
so
am
i
true
says
i
true
yet
even
as
i
spake
stood
all
tense
and
rigid
straining
my
ears
to
catch
again
the
words
of
this
hateful
song
but
now
my
dear
lady
catches
my
hand
and
peering
up
at
me
in
the
dimness
presently
draws
me
into
the
outer
cave
where
the
moon
made
a
glory
o
martin
says
she
looking
up
at
me
with
troubled
eyes
dear
martin
what
is
it
aye
what
quoth
i
wiping
sweat
from
me
god
knoweth
but
you
heard
that
song
the
words
i
heard
a
man
singing
martin
but
what
of
it
we
are
safe
here
ah
why
are
you
so
strange
damaris
says
i
joying
in
the
comfort
of
her
soft
strong
arms
about
me
dear
love
of
mine
here
is
thing
beyond
my
understanding
for
these
were
words
i
dreamed
sung
to
me
by
a
dead
man
the
man
humphrey
out
beyond
the
reef
nay
but
dear
martin
this
was
a
real
voice
is
some
shipwrecked
mariner
belike
some
castaway
aye
but
did
you
mark
these
words
damaris
nay
o
my
dear
how
should
i
at
such
a
moment
they
were
all
of
black
bartlemy
and
what
should
this
mean
think
you
nay
dear
love
never
heed
says
she
clasping
me
the
closer
aye
but
i
must
damaris
for
in
a
while
this
singing
shall
come
again
mayhap
and
if
it
doth
i
know
what
be
o
martin
martin
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
be
about
the
poor
spanish
lady
says
i
and
catching
up
my
belt
where
it
hung
i
buckled
it
about
me
ah
what
would
you
do
martin
i
for
deliverance
then
will
i
come
also
no
says
i
catching
her
in
fierce
arms
no
you
are
mine
henceforth
and
more
precious
than
life
to
me
so
must
you
bide
here
i
charge
you
by
our
love
for
look
now
is
in
my
mind
tressady
and
his
pirates
are
upon
us
at
last
those
same
rogues
that
dogged
the
friend
over
seas
howbeit
i
must
find
out
who
or
what
is
it
is
that
sings
this
hateful
i
stopped
all
at
once
for
the
voice
was
come
again
nearer
louder
than
before
and
singing
the
very
words
i
had
been
hearkening
for
and
dreading
to
hear
there
a
fine
spanish
dame
and
joanna
her
name
shall
follow
wherever
ye
go
your
black
heart
shall
feel
yow
cursed
steel
black
bartlemy
bartlemy
ho
you
heard
says
i
clapping
hand
on
knife
you
heard
yes
yes
she
whispered
her
embrace
tightening
until
i
might
feel
her
soft
body
all
against
mine
but
you
are
safe
here
martin
so
safe
says
i
that
needs
must
i
go
and
find
out
this
thing
nay
never
fear
beloved
life
hath
become
so
infinite
precious
that
i
shall
be
a
very
coward
a
craven
for
your
sake
here
shall
be
no
fighting
damaris
but
go
i
must
meanwhile
do
you
wait
me
in
the
secret
cave
and
let
down
the
ladder
only
to
my
whistle
but
now
and
lying
all
trembling
in
my
embrace
she
brake
into
passionate
weeping
and
i
powerless
to
comfort
her
farewell
happiness
she
sobbed
only
martin
dear
martin
whatsoever
may
chance
know
and
remember
always
that
i
loved
and
shall
love
you
to
the
end
of
time
then
and
all
suddenly
she
was
her
sweet
calm
self
again
and
bringing
me
my
insisted
i
must
don
it
there
and
then
beneath
my
fine
doublet
the
which
to
please
her
i
did
then
she
brought
me
one
of
the
arquebuses
but
this
i
put
by
as
too
cumbersome
taking
one
of
the
pistols
in
its
stead
so
armed
with
this
together
with
my
hatchet
and
trusty
knife
i
stepped
from
the
cave
and
she
beside
me
and
now
i
saw
she
had
dried
her
tears
and
the
hand
clasping
mine
was
firm
and
resolute
so
that
my
love
and
wonder
grew
damaris
i
cried
casting
me
on
my
knees
before
her
o
god
how
i
do
love
thee
and
kneeling
thus
i
clasped
her
slender
loveliness
kissing
the
robes
that
covered
her
and
so
rising
to
my
feet
i
hasted
away
yet
in
a
little
i
turned
to
see
her
watching
me
but
with
hands
clasped
as
one
in
prayer
now
beholding
her
thus
i
was
seized
of
a
sudden
great
desire
to
go
back
to
give
her
that
promise
and
swear
that
oath
she
sought
of
me
that
i
would
forego
my
vengeance
and
all
thought
thereof
forgetting
past
wrongs
in
the
wonder
of
her
love
but
even
as
i
stood
hesitating
she
waved
her
hand
in
farewell
and
was
gone
into
the
cave
chapter
xliii
of
the
of
the
silver
woman
a
small
wind
had
sprung
up
that
came
in
fitful
gusts
and
with
sound
very
mournful
and
desolate
but
the
moon
was
wonderfully
bright
and
though
i
went
cautiously
my
hand
on
the
butt
of
the
pistol
in
my
girdle
yet
ever
and
always
at
the
back
of
my
mind
was
an
infinitude
of
joy
by
reason
of
my
dear
lady
love
for
me
and
the
wonder
of
it
i
chose
me
a
devious
course
avoiding
the
white
sands
of
deliverance
beach
trending
towards
that
fatal
cleft
hard
by
bartlemy
tree
the
which
we
had
come
to
call
skeleton
cove
though
why
i
must
go
hither
i
knew
no
more
then
than
i
do
now
thus
went
i
my
eyes
and
ears
on
the
stretch
pondering
what
manner
of
man
this
should
be
who
sang
words
the
which
had
so
haunted
my
sick
dreams
more
than
once
i
stopped
to
stare
round
about
me
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
ocean
dreading
and
half
expecting
to
behold
the
loom
of
that
black
craft
had
dogged
us
over
seas
full
of
these
disquieting
thoughts
i
reached
the
cove
and
began
to
descend
the
steep
side
following
long
grown
familiar
the
place
hereabouts
was
honeycombed
with
small
caves
and
with
ledges
screened
by
bushes
and
tangled
vines
and
here
well
hid
from
observation
i
paused
to
look
about
me
but
and
all
in
a
moment
i
was
down
on
my
knees
for
from
somewhere
close
by
came
the
sharp
snapping
of
a
dried
stick
beneath
a
stealthy
foot
very
still
i
waited
every
nerve
and
then
forth
into
the
moonlight
sudden
and
silent
as
death
a
man
crept
and
verily
if
ever
murderous
death
stood
in
human
shape
it
was
before
me
now
the
man
stood
his
head
twisted
back
over
his
shoulder
as
watching
one
who
followed
beneath
the
vivid
scarf
that
swathed
his
temples
was
a
shock
of
red
hair
and
upon
his
cheek
the
sweat
was
glittering
then
he
turned
his
head
and
i
knew
him
for
the
man
red
andy
that
same
i
had
fought
aboard
ship
for
a
long
moment
he
stood
thus
staring
back
ever
and
anon
across
deliverance
and
so
comes
creeping
into
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
and
i
saw
the
moon
glint
on
the
barrel
of
the
long
pistol
he
clutched
as
sinking
down
behind
a
great
boulder
he
waited
there
upon
his
knees
now
suddenly
as
i
lay
there
watching
red
andy
murderous
figure
and
strung
for
swift
action
i
started
and
albeit
the
night
was
very
warm
felt
a
chill
pass
over
me
as
loud
and
clear
upon
the
stilly
air
rose
again
that
full
deep
voice
singing
hard
by
upon
deliverance
go
seek
ye
women
everywhere
north
south
lads
east
or
west
let
be
dark
let
be
fair
my
silver
woman
best
blow
high
blow
low
where
ye
go
the
silver
woman
best
aha
my
silver
woman
best
thus
sang
the
unknown
who
all
unwitting
was
coming
to
his
death
sudden
as
it
came
the
voice
was
hushed
and
nought
to
hear
save
the
hiss
and
murmur
of
the
surge
and
i
saw
the
man
andy
stir
restlessly
as
minute
after
minute
dragged
by
the
rock
where
he
crouched
lay
at
the
mouth
of
this
cove
towards
deliverance
it
being
one
of
many
that
lay
piled
thereabout
now
chancing
to
look
towards
these
scattered
rocks
and
for
no
reason
in
the
world
i
saw
a
thing
that
held
me
as
it
were
spellbound
and
this
a
small
enough
thing
in
itself
a
sharp
glittering
thing
that
seemed
fast
caught
in
a
fissure
of
one
of
those
rocks
and
i
knew
it
for
a
steel
hook
but
even
as
i
stared
at
it
the
thing
was
gone
and
so
noiselessly
that
i
if
i
had
seen
it
or
no
but
out
from
the
shadow
of
this
rock
flashed
something
that
whirled
glittering
as
it
flew
and
red
andy
starting
up
from
his
knees
was
shaken
by
a
fit
of
strange
and
awful
coughing
and
came
stumbling
forward
so
that
i
could
see
his
chin
and
breast
bedabbled
with
the
blood
that
spurted
from
his
gaping
mouth
all
at
once
he
sank
to
his
knees
and
thence
to
his
face
spreading
his
arms
wide
like
one
very
weary
but
with
the
moonlight
flashing
back
from
that
which
stood
upright
betwixt
his
and
thus
i
saw
again
the
silver
haft
of
the
dagger
that
was
shaped
like
to
a
woman
saw
this
silver
woman
dance
and
leap
glittering
ere
it
grew
terribly
still
then
came
roger
tressady
from
the
shadows
and
stooping
turned
up
the
dead
face
to
the
moon
and
tapped
it
gently
with
his
shining
hook
and
now
whipping
out
his
dagger
he
bent
to
wipe
it
on
the
dead
shirt
but
checked
suddenly
as
a
pebble
started
beneath
my
foot
and
stooped
thus
he
glared
up
beneath
thick
brows
as
i
rose
up
with
pistol
levelled
and
the
moon
bright
upon
my
face
whereupon
he
leaped
backwards
uttering
a
choking
cry
black
bartlemy
by
god
he
gasped
and
let
fall
his
reeking
dagger
upon
the
sand
and
so
we
stood
staring
on
each
other
and
with
the
dead
man
sprawling
betwixt
us
chapter
xliv
how
i
had
speech
with
roger
tressady
to
my
undoing
for
maybe
a
full
minute
we
fronted
each
other
unmoving
and
with
never
a
word
and
thus
at
last
i
beheld
this
man
tressady
a
tall
lusty
fellow
square
of
face
and
with
pale
eyes
beneath
a
jut
of
shaggy
brow
a
vivid
neckerchief
was
twisted
about
his
head
and
in
his
hairy
ears
swung
great
gold
rings
his
powerful
right
hand
was
clenched
to
knotted
fist
in
place
of
his
left
glittered
the
deadly
hook
sink
me
says
he
at
last
drawing
clenched
fist
across
his
brow
sink
me
but
ye
gave
me
a
turn
my
lord
took
ye
for
a
ghost
i
did
the
ghost
of
a
shipmate
o
mine
one
as
do
lie
buried
yonder
nought
but
poor
bones
aye
rotten
bones
as
this
will
be
soon
here
he
spurned
the
dead
man
with
his
foot
is
black
rogue
this
my
lord
one
as
would
ha
made
o
poor
tressady
aye
a
lump
murdered
clay
like
my
shipmate
bartlemy
yonder
but
for
this
silver
woman
o
mine
here
he
stooped
for
the
dagger
and
having
cleaned
it
in
the
sand
held
it
towards
me
upon
his
open
palm
aha
here
woman
hath
never
failed
me
yet
she
faithful
and
true
friend
faithful
and
true
this
silver
woman
o
mine
but
is
an
ill
world
my
master
and
full
o
bloody
rogues
like
this
sly
dog
as
stole
ashore
to
murder
me
the
fool
o
is
a
black
and
bloody
world
so
it
is
quoth
i
shut
teeth
and
all
the
worse
for
the
likes
o
you
roger
tressady
so
ho
he
knoweth
my
name
then
says
tressady
rubbing
shaven
chin
with
silver
and
viewing
me
with
his
pale
keen
gaze
but
do
i
know
him
now
do
i
i
know
you
for
pirate
and
damned
murderer
roger
tressady
so
shall

quit
this
island
this
very
hour
or
stay
here
to
rot
along
with
bartlemy
and
red
andy
now
at
this
and
all
careless
of
my
pistol
he
drew
a
slow
pace
nearer
great
head
peering
why

he
at
last
why

the
dagger
into

girdle
he
nodded
mighty
affable
but

and
all
at
once
he
turned
to
stare
away
across
deliverance
then
shrinking
cowered
towards
me
as
in
sudden
terror
stabbing
at
the
empty
air
with
his
glittering
hook
ha
what
yon
cried
he
in
awful
voice
and
i
turning
whither
his
glaring
eyes
stared
and
to
behold
my
lady
had
the
pistol
wrenched
from
my
hold
and
the
muzzle
under
my
ear
all
in
a
moment
and
stood
scowling
and
defenceless
like
the
vast
fool
i
was
split
me
says
he
tapping
me
gently
with
his
hook
o
blind
me
if
i
thought

such
a
lubberly
fool
so
old
a
trick
marty

with
the
pistol
at

by
side
and
the
dead
man
sprawling
at
our
feet
now
first
marty
lad
how
come

here
alone
on

but
sitting
thus
chin
on
fist
i
stared
down
at
red
andy
stiffening
body
silent
as
he
i
being
too
full
of
fierce
anger
and
bitter
scorn
of
my
folly

says
tressady
tapping
my
cheek
with

cunning
rogue

cunning
fierce
rogue

adam
and

i
bitterly
and
he

a
small
timid
man

timid

bold
desperate
fellows
to
beware

felt
more
comfort

ha
took
it
kinder

silver
woman

thrust
his
hook
before
my
eyes

a
pretty
thing

but

useful
at
all
times
and
serves
to
shepherd
my
lambs

many
small
malevolent
eyes
upon

distant
stir

creak
and
rumble
of
oars

to

ways
marty

done
wi
you
more
the
pity
hereupon
he
hailed
loudly
and
was
answered
from
the
lagoon
and
glancing
thither
i
saw
two
boats
crowded
with
men
pulling
for
the
beach
a
wildish
company
martin
desperate
fellows
as
ever
roved
the
main
as
i
do
love
no
more
than
they
love
me
so
say
the
word
and
share
black
bartlemy
treasure
betwixt
us
just
you
and
me
lad
me
and
you
come
what
your
will
but
shaking
my
head
and
hopelessly
enough
i
set
my
teeth
and
watched
the
coming
of
my
tormentors
and
foremost
was
a
short
plump
man
who
lacked
an
ear
and
at
his
elbows
two
others
the
one
a
lank
rogue
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
the
third
a
tall
hairy
fellow
and
observing
them
as
they
came
i
knew
them
for
those
same
three
rogues
i
had
fought
with
in
the
beside
pembury
hill
on
that
night
i
had
first
seen
my
dear
lady
hard
upon
their
heels
came
a
riotous
company
variously
armed
and
accoutred
who
forthwith
thronged
upon
me
pushing
and
jostling
for
sight
of
me
desecrating
the
quiet
night
with
their
hoarse
and
clamorous
ribaldry
unlovely
fellows
indeed
and
clad
in
garments
of
every
shape
and
cut
from
stained
home
spun
and
tattered
shirts
to
velvet
coats
and
and
beholding
this
tarnished
and
sordid
finery
these
clothes
looted
from
sinking
ships
and
blazing
towns
i
wondered
vaguely
what
had
become
of
their
late
owners
at
gesture
from
tressady
i
was
dragged
to
my
feet
and
my
arms
jerked
twisted
and
bound
before
me
crosswise
and
so
stood
i
helpless
and
in
much
painful
discomfort
whiles
tressady
harangued
his
fellows
tapping
me
gently
with
his
hook
my
bullies
quoth
he
i
promised
ye
gold
a
plenty
and
here
somewhere
on
this
island
it
lieth
waiting
to
be
found
it
needeth
but
for
this
fool
martin
here
as
some
o
you
will
mind
for
adam
penfeather
comrade
with
a
curse
it
needeth
but
for
him
to
speak
i
say
and
in
that
same
hour
each
one
o
you
may
fill
your
clutch
wi
more
treasure
than
ever
came
out
o
eldorado
or
manoa
so
speak
he
must
and
shall
eh
bullies
eh
aye
aye
they
roared
pressing
upon
me
with
a
shaking
of
fists
and
glitter
of
eager
steel
twist
his
thumbs
cried
one
slit
his
nose
roared
another
trim
his
yeres
cried
a
third
but
tressady
silenced
them
with
a
flourish
of
his
hook
lads
says
he
you
all
mean
well
but
you
bunglers
here
a
little
delicate
matter
as
none
can
handle
like
the
smiler
there
none
like
sam
can
make
a
man
give
tongue
pass
the
word
for
smiling
sam
step
forward
sammy
hereupon
cometh
the
great
fat
fellow
spraggons
who
had
been
mate
aboard
the
faithful
friend
forcing
his
way
with
vicious
elbows
and
mighty
anxious
to
come
at
me
o
love
my
limbs
says
he
in
his
voice
and
blinking
his
hairless
lids
at
me
o
cherish
my
guts
leave
him
to
me
the
lad
to
make
this
yer
cock
crow
see
now
a
good
sharp
knife
the
finger
or
drew
slow
mates
slow
or
a
hot
iron
close
agen
his
eyes
is
good
or
boiling
water
poured
in
his
yeres
might
serve
then
aha
i
know
a
dainty
little
trick
a
small
cord
d
see
twisted
athwart
his
head
just
the
brows
twisted
and
twisted
as
shall
start
his
eyes
out
right
pretty
to
behold
i
mind
too
as
lollonais
had
a
trick
o
bursting
a
man
guts
wi
water
bring
him
to
the
beach
yonder
says
tressady
watching
me
ever
with
his
pale
eyes
there
shall
be
more
room
yonder
so
they
hailed
me
along
betwixt
them
and
with
huge
merriment
but
scarce
were
we
out
of
the
cove
and
hard
beside
bartlemy
tree
than
i
started
to
the
vicious
prick
of
a
knife
and
whirling
about
despite
the
fierce
hands
that
sought
to
hold
me
i
saw
smiling
sam
about
to
stab
me
again
but
now
as
i
strove
with
my
reeling
captors
was
a
flicker
of
vicious
steel
as
tressady
sprang
and
whipping
his
hook
beneath
the
great
fellow
belt
whirled
smiling
sam
from
his
feet
despite
his
prodigious
weight
and
forthwith
trampled
upon
him
my
merry
lad
quoth
tressady
glaring
down
into
smiling
convulsed
face
and
must
ye
be
at
it
afore
i
give
the
word
captain
here
who
come
speak
up
my
roaring
boy
and
he
thrust
his
hook
beneath
the
smiler
great
flabby
chin
mercy
mercy
cried
spraggons
his
voice
rising
to
a
pitiful
squeal
not
the
hook
o
lord
love
me
not
the
hook
hook
and
why
not
sam
why
not
is
sharp
and
clean
and
quick
and
hath
done
the
business
o
nicer
rogues
than
you
bully
aye
and
better
sam
better
o
for
god
sake
who
you
to
call
on
god
so
glib
sammy
is
marvel
he
do
strike
ye
blind
lad
or
there
your
innards
sam
here
that
may
whip
out
your
liver
lad
so
i
saw
the
glitter
of
the
hook
heard
smiling
sam
gasping
scream
as
the
steel
bit
into
him
and
then
tressady
was
on
his
feet
smiling
round
upon
his
awed
and
silent
company
bullies
says
he
pointing
to
the
smiler
inanimate
form
here
poor
sam
all
swounded
away
at
touch
o
my
hook
like
any
woman
and
him
my
pshaw
i
want
a
man
here
he
stooped
and
wrenching
the
silver
pipe
from
smiling
sam
fat
throat
stared
from
one
shuffling
rogue
to
another
step
forward
abner
says
he
at
last
come
you
do
you
a
prime
you
my
henceforth
but
now
smiling
sam
awaking
from
his
swoon
moaned
feebly
and
sat
up
not
the
hook
he
wailed
o
not
that
no
smiler
no
i
keep
it
for
better
men
disobey
me
again
and
drown
ye
in
a
puddle
and
now
up
wi
you
sammy
up
wi
you
and
stand
by
to
teach
martin
here
how
to
talk
aye
aye
aye
aye
says
the
gross
fellow
rising
nimbly
enough
whiles
his
comrades
closed
about
us
expectant
and
glancing
from
me
to
tressady
where
he
had
seated
himself
on
a
boulder
here
will
do
says
he
pointing
to
a
brilliant
strip
of
moonlit
sand
midway
betwixt
the
shadows
of
the
cliff
and
bartlemy
tree
on
his
back
hearties
and
grapple
him
fast
he
strong
as
i
am
now
his
hand
smiler
his
right
hand
aye
aye
quoth
the
fellow
kneeling
above
me
where
i
lay
helpless
will
i
cut
it
adrift
slow
like
and
as
he
flourished
his
knife
i
saw
a
trickle
of
saliva
at
the
corners
of
his
great
loose
mouth
off
at
the
wrist
or
fingers
first
no
fool
his
first
try
that
sweating
and
with
every
nerve
i
watched
that
cruel
knife
holding
my
breath
in
expectation
of
the
coming
agony
and
then
from
the
black
gloom
of
the
cliff
beyond
burst
a
sudden
echoing
roar
i
heard
the
whine
of
a
bullet
and
immediately
all
was
confusion
and
uproar
shouts
of
dismay
and
a
wild
rush
for
shelter
from
this
sudden
attack
but
as
i
struggled
to
my
knees
tressady
great
hand
gripped
my
throat
and
dragging
me
behind
a
boulder
he
pinned
me
there
stand
by
lads
he
roared
level
at
the
cliff
yonder
but
let
no
man
pull
trigger
wait
till
they
fire
again
and
mark
the
flash
helpless
in
my
bonds
and
crushed
beneath
tressady
knee
i
heard
a
stir
and
rustle
to
right
and
left
of
me
the
click
of
cocking
triggers
and
thereafter
silence
and
marking
the
gleam
of
pistol
and
i
fell
to
an
agony
of
dread
well
knowing
whence
that
merciful
shot
had
come
for
mayhap
five
minutes
nought
was
to
hear
save
the
rustle
of
stealthy
arm
or
leg
and
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
until
at
length
one
spoke
what
now
captain
us
ca
bide
here
all
night
how
many
are
we
purdy
thirty
and
nine
captain
then
do
you
take
ten
and
scale
the
starboard
cliff
and
you
abner
with
other
ten
take
the
cliff
to
larboard
i
bide
here
wi
the
rest
and
so
we
have
them
cliffs
be
perilous
high
my
hook
is
more
perilous
tom
day
off
wi
you
ye
dogs
or
i
show
ye
a
liver
yet
and
be
he
stopped
all
at
once
as
faint
at
first
yet
most
dreadful
to
hear
there
rose
a
man
cry
chilling
the
flesh
with
horror
a
cry
that
waxed
and
swelled
louder
and
louder
to
a
hideous
screaming
that
shrilled
upon
the
night
and
sinking
to
an
awful
bubbling
murmur
was
gone
up
sprang
tressady
to
stare
away
across
deliverance
whence
this
dreadful
cry
had
come
and
i
saw
his
hook
at
his
great
chin
then
beyond
these
shining
sands
was
the
thunderous
roar
of
a
great
gun
a
furious
rattle
of
that
echoed
and
near
and
far
and
thereafter
single
shots
in
rapid
succession
hereupon
rose
shouts
and
cries
of
dismay
lord
love
us
we
beset
o
we
be
took
fore
and
aft
what
shall
us
do
yon
was
a
gun
what
o
the
ship
what
o
the
ship
yonder
look
yonder
who
comes
cried
tressady
pointing
towards
deliverance
beach
with
his
glittering
hook
twisting
my
head
as
i
lay
i
looked
whither
he
pointed
and
saw
one
that
ran
towards
us
yet
in
mighty
strange
fashion
reeling
in
wide
like
a
drunken
man
and
sometimes
he
checked
only
to
come
on
again
and
sometimes
he
fell
only
to
struggle
up
by
god
it
abnegation
cries
tressady
is
my
comrade
mings
look
to
the
prisoner
ye
dogs
you
tom
purdy
i
for
abnegation
and
off
he
went
at
a
run
at
his
going
was
mighty
talk
and
discussion
what
they
should
do
some
men
being
for
stealing
away
in
the
boats
others
for
taking
to
the
woods
and
all
clean
forgetting
me
where
i
lay
but
suddenly
they
fell
silent
all
for
abnegation
was
hailing
feebly
and
was
come
so
nigh
that
we
might
see
him
his
face
all
bloody
his
knees
bending
under
him
with
weakness
as
he
stumbled
on
suddenly
beholding
tressady
he
stopped
and
hailed
him
in
wild
gasping
voice
roger
o
roger
the
devil
aboard
us
roger
penfeather
on
us
penfeather
took
the
ship
i
all
that
left
alive
they
killed
sol
first
did
ye
hear
him
die
roger
o
did
ye
hear
i
saw
him
fall
and
tressady
run
to
lift
him
and
watched
these
pirate
rogues
as
with
oaths
and
cries
of
dismay
they
hasted
hither
to
throng
about
the
two
then
rolling
into
the
nearest
shadow
i
struggled
to
my
feet
and
found
myself
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
tree
and
now
as
i
strove
desperately
against
the
rope
that
bit
into
the
flesh
of
me
i
felt
the
rope
fall
away
felt
two
soft
arms
close
about
me
and
a
soft
breath
on
my
cheek
martin
o
thank
god
turning
i
caught
my
dear
brave
lady
to
my
heart
heedless
of
aught
else
in
the
world
beside
i
clasped
her
in
my
aching
arms
and
kissed
her
until
she
stayed
me
and
showing
me
where
stood
our
enemies
a
wild
disordered
company
took
my
hand
and
began
to
run
reaching
the
cliff
we
climbed
together
nor
stayed
until
she
had
brought
me
to
a
little
cave
where
lay
an
arquebus
together
with
bandoliers
i
tried
to
reload
it
dear
martin
but
was
vain
my
poor
silly
hands
shook
so
for
o
my
dear
i
heard
them
saw
them
and
thought
i
should
run
mad
o
martin
my
love
so
now
whiles
i
loaded
the
arquebus
i
told
her
as
well
as
i
might
something
of
what
i
thought
concerning
her
brave
spirit
of
my
undying
love
for
her
though
in
fashion
very
lame
and
halting
thereafter
the
weapon
being
ready
i
placed
it
near
and
sitting
within
the
gloom
of
this
little
cave
i
took
my
love
into
my
arms
her
dear
head
pillowed
on
my
breast
and
kissed
the
tremors
from
her
sweet
mouth
and
the
horror
from
her
eyes
and
thus
with
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
her
soft
smooth
cheek
against
mine
we
waited
for
what
was
to
be
chapter
xlv
of
the
coming
of
adam
penfeather
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
below
our
crept
divers
of
these
pirate
rogues
and
crouching
there
cheek
by
jowl
fell
to
a
hoarse
mutter
of
talk
yet
all
too
low
for
us
to
catch
but
presently
there
brake
out
a
voice
the
which
i
knew
for
that
of
smiling
sam

done

tell

along
of

and
watch
our
chance
t
heave
penfeather
overboard
and
go
on
our
own
account
well
at
this
was
sudden
silence
and
thereafter
a
fierce
mutter
of
whispering
lost
all
at
once
in
the
clatter
of
arms
and
breathless
scuffling
as
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
for
there
within
a
yard
of
them
stood
tressady
hand
grasping
the
dagger
in
his
belt
his
glittering
hook
tapping
softly
at
his
great
chin
as
he
stared
from
one
to
other
of
them
ha
my
pretty
lambs
says
he
coming
a
pace
nearer

upon

and

for
the
first
time
you
tom
purdy
step
forward
so
now
where
the
prisoner
as
i
set
i
your
charge
where
my
merry
bird
where
the
fellow
shrank
away
muttering
some
sullen
rejoinder
that
ended
in
a
choking
scream
as
tressady
sprang
then
i
knowing
what
was
toward
clasped
my
lady
to
me
covering
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
those
ghastly
bubbling
groans
yet
felt
her
sweet
body
shaking
with
the
horror
that
shook
me
so
there
an
end
o
tom
purdy
my
bullies
gasped
tressady
stooping
to
clean
his
hook
in
the
sand
and
i
did
it
because
he
failed
me
once
d
see
who
be
next
who
for

and

has
is

the
island
and

and

and

fourteen
and
in

little
be

the

then
aha
look
yonder
the
fools
be
coming
into
our
very
clutches
to
cover
lads
and
look
to
your
primings
and
wait
my
word
now
glancing
whither
he
pointed
i
saw
above
the
adjacent
headland
the
tapering
spars
of
a
ship
slowly
she
hove
into
view
boltsprit
forecastle
waist
and
poop
until
she
was
plain
to
view
and
i
knew
her
for
that
same
black
ship
that
fouled
us
in
deptford
pool
she
was
standing
in
for
the
island
under
her
lower
courses
only
although
the
wind
was
very
light
but
on
she
came
and
very
slowly
until
she
was
so
near
that
i
might
see
the
very
muzzles
of
her
guns
suddenly
with
a
cheery
her
yards
were
braced
round
her
anchor
was
let
go
and
she
brought
to
opposite
skeleton
cove
and
within
fair
now
glancing
below
i
saw
tressady
stand
alone
and
with
abnegation
mings
huddled
at
his
feet
but
in
the
gloom
of
the
cave
and
to
right
and
left
in
every
patch
of
shadow
and
behind
every
bush
and
rock
was
the
glimmer
of
pistol
or
and
all
levelled
in
the
one
direction
presently
up
to
the
lofty
poop
of
the
ship
clambered
a
short
squat
man
in
marvellous
wide
breeches
and
a
great
cutlass
on
hip
who
clapping
to
mouth
roared
amain
ahoy

i
heard
a
whisper
a
murmur
and
the
word
england
oft
repeated
tressady
heard
it
also
and
stepping
forward
he
drew
a
long
furrow
in
the
sand
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
my
hearty
boys
says
he
pointing
to
this
furrow
with

a
murmur

angry

saying
he
turned
and
i
watched

stride
out
upon
that
spit
of
sand
hard
by
bartlemy
tree
and
this
great
fat
fellow
trotting
at
his
heels
upon
the
edge
of
the

o

ye
rogue
round
sprang
tressady
as
out
from
the
dense
shadow
of
bartlemy
tree
stepped
adam
penfeather
himself
he
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
very
still
and
viewing
tressady
with
head
grimly
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
a
pistol
in
the
fist
and
deadly
menace
in
every
line
of
his
small
spare
figure
i
here
tressady
says
he
his
voice
ringing
loud
and
clear
and
i
am

and
eight
o
my

but

broadside

hour

adam
says
tressady
and
with
swift
glance
towards
the
sinking
moon
and
who
to
do
it
who
there
be
thirty
and
eight
shall
swing
ye
aloft
so
soon
as
i
give
the
word
tressady
you
do
talk
rank
folly
adam
folly
and
ye
know
it
says
he
smiling
and
stealing
furtive
hand
to
the
dagger
in
his
girdle
but
and
i
should
die
this
night
i
take
you
along
wi
me
and
you
can
lay
to
but
he
got
no
further
for
smiling
sam
and
marvellous
nimble
whipped
up
a
stone
and
leaping
on
him
from
behind
smote
him
two
murderous
blows
and
staggering
helplessly
tressady
pitched
forward
upon
his
face
and
lay
upon
the
verge
of
the
incoming
tide
beholding
his
handiwork
smiling
sam
uttered
a
thin
laugh
and
spitting
upon
that
still
form
kicked
it
viciously
oho
penfeather
cries
he
is
the
smiler
hath
saved
ye
the
labour
is
sam
hath
finished
tressady
at
last
and
be
damned
t
him
and
now
is
the
smiler
as
do
be
first
to
wi
ye
and
he
began
to
shamble
across
the
sands
but
passing
that
rock
where
crouched
abnegation
mings
he
tripped
and
fell
and
i
saw
the
flash
of
abnegation
knife
as
they
rolled
and
twisted
in
the
shadow
of
this
rock
whiles
from
this
shadow
rose
a
shrill
crying
like
the
wail
of
a
hurt
child
and
into
the
moonlight
came
a
great
fat
hand
that
clutched
and
tore
at
the
sand
then
grew
suddenly
still
and
with
crooked
fingers
plunged
deep
into
the
sand
like
a
white
claw
then
tossing
aside
his
bloody
knife
abnegation
mings
struggled
to
his
feet
and
came
staggering
to
kneel
above
his
comrade
tressady
and
to
turn
up
the
pallid
face
of
him
to
the
moon
and
now
adam
thrust
away
his
pistols
and
with
hands
clasped
behind
him
turned
to
face
the
gloomy
shadows
of
skeleton
cove
come
out
sons
o
dogs
says
he
step
forward
and
show
yourselves
and
lively
it
is
ensued
a
moment
breathless
pause
then
from
bush
and
shadow
and
rocks
they
stole
forth
these
thirty
and
eight
and
at
adam
harsh
command
lined
up
before
him
shoulder
and
shoulder
well
says
adam
pacing
slowly
along
their
rank
to
peer
into
every
sullen
face
am
i
captain
here
aye
or
no
aye
aye
they
cried
in
eager
chorus
and
us
was
promised
a
free
pardon
quoth
one
and
a
share
of
the
treasure
says
another
and
england
cried
a
third
there
some
on
us
as
do
be
honest
and
forced
to
turn
pirate
in
spite
o
we
avast
says
adam
what
i
promise
i
stand
by
but
mark

let
any
man
fail
of
his
duty
to
me
but
once

agreed
we
serve

faithful
and
true
they
cried
why
then
bring
ropes
says
adam
and
with
his
new
men
at
his
heels
goes
whither
lay
tressady
and
with
abnegation
mings
yet
crouched
above
him
what
now
was
doing
i
might
not
see
by
reason
of
the
crowd
but
i
heard
the
voice
of
mings
upraised
in
fierce
invective
and
the
throng
presently
parting
beheld
him
trussed
hand
and
foot
and
dragged
along
with
tressady
towards
bartlemy
tree
there
a
noose
was
set
about
the
neck
of
each
and
the
rope
ends
cast
over
a
branch
but
as
at
command
these
miserable
wretches
were
hauled
aloft
to
their
deaths
my
lady
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
grasped
my
arm
in
desperate
hands
martin
she
panted
o
martin
is
horrible
save
them
this
must
not
shall
not
be
is
but
justice
says
i
these
men
are
pirates
and
murderers
this
is
no
justice
cries
she
breathlessly
her
face
all
pale
and
drawn
and
these
men
are
sore
hurt
beside
ah
god
look
stop
them
martin
o
stop
them
nay
then
i
will
and
here
or
ever
i
could
let
or
stay
her
she
begins
to
clamber
down
into
the
cove
howbeit
quick
and
though
she
was
i
was
presently
before
her
and
so
came
running
knife
in
hand
nor
was
i
any
too
soon
for
as
i
reached
the
tree
tressady
and
mings
were
dragged
choking
from
their
feet
but
with
a
couple
of
strokes
my
keen
knife
had
cut
those
deadly
ropes
asunder
and
as
the
two
fell
gasping
on
the
sand
i
turned
to
stare
into
the
scowling
eyes
of
adam
penfeather
now
as
i
stood
thus
someone
spoke
sigh
and
groan
bartlemy
is
bartlemy
and
the
word
was
taken
up
by
others
bartlemy
black
bartlemy
and
all
men
fell
back
from
me
whiles
adam
scowled
at
me
above
levelled
pistol
hold
off
adam
i
panted
let
be
adam
penfeather
let
be
what
says
he
peering
and

i
came
ashore
to
see

two
rogues

and

penfeather
says
i
scowling
in
turn
you

cozened
and
tricked

that
drugged

aboard

what
to
stay

from
hanging
you
along
with

shooting

the
fool

i
cried
a
voice
and
there
betwixt
us
was
my
lady
she
all
stately
dignity
despite
her
hurried
breathing
at
sight
of
whom
these
lawless
fellows
gave
back
one
and
all
even
adam
himself
retreated
a
step
staring
upon
her
then
very
slowly
he
thrust
pistols
into
belt
and
uncovering
his
head
bowed
full
low
and
i
fancied
his
thin
lips
twitched
as
he
did
so
so
be
it
my
lady
says
he
i
call
on
your
ladyship
to
witness
that
i
sell
two
bundles
of
very
unseemly
merchandise
and
he
pointed
towards
the
two
helpless
forms
at
his
feet
and
now
with
your
fair
leave
madam
i
see
these
fellows
safe
aboard
and
warn
my
lord
dering
and
gentlemen
of
your
welfare
and
presence
here
wait
says
i
as
he
turned
to
go
first
i
would
have
these
my
purchases
set
aboard
a
boat
with
such
stores
needful
and
cast
adrift
why
this
was
not
in
the
bargain
martin
says
he
shaking
his
head
but
it
shall
be
done
for
sake
of
our
comradeship
and
away
he
goes
and
his
fellows
with
him
true
to
his
word
he
orders
the
pinnace
launched
and
sends
divers
men
to
bear
these
two
rogues
aboard
hereupon
i
cut
away
their
bonds
doing
the
which
i
found
tressady
still
unconscious
but
mings
for
all
his
wounds
seemed
lively
enough
master
says
he
staring
hard
at
me
your
name
martin
as
i
think
and
what
then
says
i
mighty
short
is
a
name
i
shall
mind
as
long
as
i
do
my
own
and
that
is
mings
abnegation
mings
aye
says
i
you
told
me
this
when
you
sang
of
dead
men
in
a
wood
at
midnight
ha
was
you
was
it
master
well
here
lieth
poor
roger
dead
or
dying
and
me
little
better
and
is
far
to
the
main
and
an
ill
journey
but
should
we
come
there
and
live
there
be
two
men
shall
wonder
at
ye
master
nor
ever
forget
the
name
o
the
man
as
saved
our
necks
howsoever
come
life
or
death
here
abnegation
doth
wish
ye
a
fair
wind
ever
and
always
master
so
they
bore
him
together
with
tressady
to
the
pinnace
and
setting
them
aboard
shoved
them
adrift
and
i
watched
abnegation
ply
feeble
oars
until
the
boat
was
through
the
passage
in
the
reef
and
out
in
the
open
sea
beyond
chapter
xlvi
how
i
doubted
myself
now
as
i
stood
thus
staring
out
to
sea
the
moon
sank
and
with
it
my
heart
also
for
as
the
dark
came
about
me
so
came
darkness
within
me
and
sudden
sorrow
with
great
fear
of
the
future
wherefore
beholding
the
loom
of
the
ship
where
lights
twinkled
i
would
gladly
have
seen
her
a
shattered
wreck
and
hearing
the
hoarse
laughter
and
voices
of
these
lawless
fellows
waking
the
echoes
of
deliverance
beach
i
hated
them
one
and
all
and
to
my
fear
and
sorrow
anger
was
added
but
now
cometh
my
dear
lady
to
stand
beside
me
to
steal
her
hand
into
mine
and
never
a
word
betwixt
us
for
a
while
at
last
so
endeth
our
solitude
martin
aye
our
deliverance
is
come
says
she
and
then
very
softly
doth
not
this
rejoice
you
here
answer
found
i
none
since
now
at
last
i
knew
this
the
very
thing
i
had
come
most
to
dread
so
was
silence
again
save
for
these
hoarse
unlovely
voices
where
they
launched
and
boarded
the
longboat
master
adam
would
have
me
go
on
board
martin
but
is
near
dawn
so
will
i
bide
with
you
to
welcome
this
new
day
i
glad
you
stayed
damaris
at
this
i
felt
her
clasp
tighten
on
my
fingers
and
so
she
brings
me
to
a
rock
hard
by
and
sinking
on
the
warm
sand
would
have
me
sit
by
her
thus
side
by
side
we
watched
the
boat
pull
away
to
the
ship
and
presently
all
about
us
was
hushed
and
still
save
for
the
murmur
of
the
surge
martin
says
she
in
a
while
with
this
new
day
beginneth
for
us
a
new
life
in
a
few
short
hours
we
sail
for
england
england
aye
to
be
sure
says
i
mighty
doleful
but
conscious
of
her
regard
strove
to
look
happy
yet
made
such
a
botch
of
it
that
getting
to
her
knees
she
takes
my
face
betwixt
her
two
hands
o
but
you
are
glad
she
questions
a
little
breathlessly
glad
to
come
with
me
to
england
to
leave
this
wilderness
aye
i
nodded
choking
on
the
word
dear
martin
look
at
me
she
commanded
now
speak
me
plain
whence
is
your
grief
o
my
lady
quoth
i
is
the
knowledge
of
my
unworthiness
my
unloveliness
my
rude
and
graceless
ways
england
is
no
place
for
like
of
me
i
am
well
enough
here
in
the
wild
to
work
for
you
fight
for
you
an
need
be
but
how
may
i
compare
with
your
fine
gallants
and
courtly
gentlemen
now
at
this
she
clasps
me
all
sudden
in
her
arms
and
setting
soft
cheek
to
mine
falls
me
yet
kissing
me
full
oft
calling
me
silly
dear
foolish
and
beloved
how
shall
you
compare
cries
she
thus
and
thus
dear
martin
so
infinitely
above
and
beyond
all
other
men
that
unless
you
wed
me
needs
must
i
die
a
maid
thus
did
she
comfort
me
soothing
my
fears
and
thus
the
dawn
found
us
o
is
day
she
sighed
is
day
already
and
now
was
her
voice
was
doleful
whiles
her
eyes
gazed
regretful
round
about
the
white
sands
of
deliverance
and
the
highlands
beyond
o
indeed
i
do
love
this
dear
island
of
ours
martin
sudden
upon
the
stilly
air
was
the
beat
of
oars
and
we
beheld
a
boat
rowed
by
a
couple
of
mariners
and
in
the
sir
rupert
dering
and
the
three
gentlemen
his
companions
hereupon
my
lady
would
have
me
go
with
her
to
meet
them
then
and
there
but
i
shook
my
head
do
you
go
damaris
i
not
speak
them
before
i
must
and
should
you
have
cause
to
mention
me
i
pray
you
will
not
tell
my
name
as
you
will
dear
martin
says
she
and
pressing
my
hand
goes
her
way
from
the
shadow
of
the
rock
i
watched
these
gentlemen
leap
gaily
ashore
to
bow
before
her
with
many
and
divers
elegant
posturings
flourishes
and
flauntings
of
hats
kissing
of
her
hands
and
the
like
gallantries
until
i
must
needs
scowl
otherwhere
yet
even
so
was
conscious
of
their
merry
laughter
where
they
paced
to
and
fro
and
the
new
risen
sun
making
a
glory
about
her
at
last
she
curtseys
and
staying
them
with
a
gesture
comes
hasting
back
to
me
martin
says
she
it
seems
there
be
men
wounded
and
dying
on
board
ship
so
must
i
go
to
them
will
you
not
come
with
me
nay
i
answered
i
to
the
caves
for
such
things
as
you
would
bring
away
why
then
my
spoon
martin
and
stool
bring
these
nay
wait
is
there
i
would
bid
farewell
to
this
our
dear
island
wait
me
there
martin
so
away
she
goes
on
her
errand
of
mercy
leaving
me
to
my
thoughts
and
these
all
of
england
and
my
future
life
there
i
was
fain
to
picture
myself
married
and
happy
in
my
lady
love
my
life
thenceforth
a
succession
of
peaceful
days
amid
the
ordered
quiet
of
that
kentish
countryside
i
knew
and
loved
so
well
with
the
eye
of
my
mind
i
seemed
to
see
a
road
winding
bloomy
hedgerows
past
chattering
brooks
and
pleasant
meadows
past
sleepy
hamlet
bowered
trees
and
so
a
leafy
shade
to
where
rose
tall
gates
their
pillars
crowned
by
couchant
leopards
wrought
in
the
stone
and
beyond
these
a
broad
avenue
its
green
shadow
splashed
with
sunlight
leading
away
to
the
house
of
conisby
shene
with
its
wide
terrace
where
stood
my
lady
waiting
and
expectant
yet
nowhere
could
i
vision
myself
and
now
i
must
needs
bethink
me
of
godby
long
dark
road
with
the
beckoning
light
and
the
waiting
arms
of
love
and
in
my
heart
the
old
doubt
waked
and
a
fear
that
such
peace
such
tender
meetings
and
welcomes
sweet
were
not
for
such
as
i
nor
ever
could
be
from
these
gloomy
reflections
i
was
roused
by
a
giggling
laugh
and
glancing
about
espied
sir
rupert
and
his
three
fellows
their
finery
somewhat
the
worse
for
their
late
hardship
yet
themselves
very
gay
and
debonair
none
the
less
as
they
stood
viewing
me
and
mighty
interested
presently
sir
rupert
steps
up
to
me
with
his
haughtiest
air
and
no
civility
of
bowing
let
me
perish
but
here
notable
change
says
he
surveying
my
rich
attire
so
that
i
yearned
for
my
rags
again
here
is
strange
metamorphosis
the
sullen
and
rustic
cymon
bloometh
at
mandate
caliban
is
tamed
at
the
which
sally
his
companions
giggled
again
sir
quoth
i
and
awkwardly
enough
i
am
in
no
mood
for
your
pleasantries
if
therefore
you
have
aught
else
to
say
of
me
pray
remove
out
o
my
hearing
this
protest
sir
rupert
fanned
airily
aside
with
hand
i
gather
says
he
that
you
have
been
at
some
pains
of
service
to
my
lady
brandon
in
her
late
dolorous
situation
here
receive
my
thanks
i
wish
none
o
your
thanks
sir
none
the
less
i
bestow
on
my
lady
brandon
behalf
furthermore
enough
sir
i
would
be
alone
furthermore
he
continued
and
with
another
airy
motion
of
his
white
fingers
i
would
have
you
particularly
remark
that
if
my
lady
brandon
lacking
better
company
hath
stooped
to
any
small
familiarities
with
you
these
must
be
forgot
and
ha
i
cried
springing
to
my
feet
begone
paltry
fool
lest
i
kick
you
harder
than
i
did
last
time
at
conisby
shene
insolent
he
panted
reaching
for
his
but
as
he
freed
it
from
scabbard
i
closed
with
him
and
wrenching
it
from
his
hold
belaboured
him
soundly
with
the
flat
of
it
and
such
of
his
companions
as
chanced
within
my
reach
until
hearing
shouts
i
espied
adam
approaching
with
divers
of
his
grinning
fellows
whereupon
i
snapped
the
blade
across
my
knee
and
hasted
from
the
place
i
strode
on
haphazard
in
a
blind
fury
but
reaching
the
woods
at
last
and
safe
from
all
observation
i
cast
myself
down
therein
and
gradually
my
anger
grew
to
a
great
bitterness
for
thinks
i
am
i
in
very
truth
an
outcast
from
my
kind
a
creature
shamed
by
pillory
and
lash
a
poor
wretch
for
spiteful
buffets
hereupon
being
a
blind
fool
ever
i
cursed
the
world
and
all
men
in
it
saving
only
my
unworthy
self
and
next
bethinking
me
of
my
dear
lady
who
of
her
infinite
mercy
had
stooped
to
love
such
as
i
it
seemed
that
my
shame
must
smirch
her
also
that
rather
than
lifting
me
to
her
level
i
must
needs
drag
her
down
to
mine
she
wedding
me
gave
all
whiles
i
taking
all
had
nought
to
offer
in
return
save
my
unworthiness
verily
it
seemed
that
my
hopes
of
life
with
her
in
england
were
but
empty
dreams
that
i
had
been
living
in
the
very
paradise
of
fools
unless
here
i
raised
bowed
head
and
clenching
my
fists
stared
blindly
before
me
how
if
the
ship
should
sail
without
us
chapter
xlvii
how
my
doubting
was
resolved
for
me
the
sun
being
and
myself
famished
with
hunger
i
set
off
for
our
habitation
by
paths
from
observation
and
yearning
mightily
to
find
my
lady
there
having
scaled
the
cliff
i
reached
the
little
plateau
and
parting
the
bushes
recoiled
from
the
muzzle
of
a
piece
levelled
at
me
by
a
squat
grim
fellow
what
godby
says
i
frowning
d
take
me
for
murderer
still
then
at
this
he
let
fall
his
musket
in
blank
amaze
and
then
came
running
and
with
hands
outstretched
o
pal
cries
he
o
pal
have
i
found
ye
at
last
ha
many
the
time
i
grieved
for
ye
and
my
fool
doubts
o
you
martin
choke
me
else
i
sorry
pal
burn
me
but
i
repented
my
suspecting
o
you
ever
since
though
to
be
sure
you
was
mighty
strange
aboard
the
friend
and
small
wonder
but
here
me
full
o
repentance
martin
so
if
you
can
forgive
poor
godby
full
and
freely
says
i
whereupon
he
hugs
me
and
the
tears
running
down
his
sunburned
cheeks
then
we
pals
again
martin
and
all
bowmon
and
what
o
me
turning
about
i
beheld
adam
on
the
threshold
of
the
cave
what
o
me
shipmate
aye
what
says
i
folding
my
arms
ha
doth
the
tap
o
my
smart
yet
martin
i
know
you
beyond
all
doubt
for
pirate
and
buccaneer
all
past
and
done
martin
i
know
you
planned
from
the
first
to
seize
the
friend
aye
but
where
your
proof
the
friend
is
blown
up
and
by
your
hand
like
as
not
true
again
so
it
was
martin
and
thereby
did
i
outwit
tressady
and
saved
the
lives
of
my
own
people
you
have
been
at
great
pains
to
befool
me
to
your
evil
ends
at
no
pains
martin
was
purely
simple
matter
you
have
been
the
death
of
divers
men
on
this
island
but
always
in
fair
fight
says
he
glancing
at
me
in
his
furtive
fashion
was
them
or
me
comrade
and
black
rogues
all
so
you
say
and
who
to
deny
it
shipmate
aye
who
indeed
it
seems
you
killed
all
ha
d
doubt
my
word
martin
aye
i
do
so
and
judging
from
what
i
know
i
do
take
ye
for
a
very
rogue
and
so
i
done
with
you
henceforth
rogue
says
he
is
an
ill
word
and
yet
i
had
rather
be
rogue
than
fool
and
you
are
the
fool
of
the
world
martin
for
here
are
you
seeking
quarrel
with
your
best
friend
friend
quoth
i
o
god
protect
me
from
such
now
you
have
named
me
rogue
and
good
as
called
me
liar
which
is
great
folly
seeing
you
do
lie
in
my
power
so
here
will
i
prove
my
friendship
and
the
depth
of
your
folly
nay
i
hear
no
more
aye
but
you
will
cover
him
godby
and
fire
if
i
say
so
o
lord
love
me
groaned
godby
but
obeyed
nevertheless
and
looking
where
he
stood
his
piece
levelled
at
me
i
knew
he
would
obey
word
despite
his
anguished
looks
and
now
says
adam
crossing
his
arms
here
the
truth
o
i
found
a
poor
wretch
bent
on
vengeance
murder
and
a
rogue
death
which
was
pure
folly
i
offered
you
riches
the
which
you
refused
and
this
was
arrant
folly
i
took
you
for
comrade
brought
you
aboard
ship
with
offer
of
honest
employ
which
you
likewise
refused
and
here
was
more
folly
your
conduct
on
board
ship
was
all
folly
so
despite
yourself
i
set
you
on
a
fair
island
with
the
right
noble
and
handsome
lady
that
you
by
love
might
perchance
learn
some
little
wisdom
well
you
fall
in
love
stop
cried
i
clenching
my
fists
not
i
says
he
uncrossing
his
arms
and
i
saw
he
had
levelled
a
pistol
at
me
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
i
no
fine
gentleman
for
ye
to
bruise
so
haul
your
wind
and
listen
you
fall
in
love
with
my
lady
as
how
could
you
help
and
she
with
you
which
is
a
matter
of
some
wonder
so
here
are
you
full
o
love
but
doth
this
teach
ye
wisdom
never
a
whit
for
now
must
you
fall
foul
and
belabour
our
four
gallants
and
from
mere
fine
gentlemen
transform
into
your
deadly
enemies
and
here
was
folly
stupendous
and
now
you
must
quarrel
with
me
the
which
is
folly
absolute
thus
do
i
find
ye
fool
persistent
and
consistent
ever
and
i
being
so
infinitely
the
opposite
do
contemn
you
therefore
and
now
ha
you
done
i
demanded
raging
not
quite
martin
you
balked
me
i
the
hanging
o
these
two
rogues
tressady
and
mings
and
here
was
pitiful
folly
since
to
hang
such
were
a
wise
and
prudent
measure
thus
have
you
loosed
murder
on
my
heels
again
well
let
that
go
but
you
doubted
my
word
you
named
me
rogue
and
for
this
you
shall
fight
me
so
saying
he
stepped
into
the
cave
and
brought
thence
that
same
spanish
rapier
i
no
mind
to
fight
with
you
says
i
turning
away
an
excellent
blade
says
he
making
a
pass
in
the
air
then
he
tendered
it
to
me
hilt
foremost
and
with
the
little
bow
is
right
you
should
know
i
am
wearing
the
no
matter
quoth
he
drawing
there
is
your
throat
or
your
eye
come
so
point
to
point
we
fell
to
it
i
had
been
somewhat
esteemed
at
the
art
once
and
now
i
matched
his
vicious
thrusts
with
cunning
parades
with
volts
and
passes
pushing
at
him
when
i
might
so
that
twice
i
was
very
near
but
suddenly
as
he
retreated
before
my
attack
his
blade
darted
and
flashed
and
he
called
out
one
and
now
he
pressed
me
in
turn
with
quick
thrusts
and
bewildering
feints
and
presently
called
out
again
two
three
four
then
i
saw
he
was
cutting
the
buttons
from
my
sleeve
how
and
when
he
would
therefore
i
cast
away
my
sword
in
petulant
anger
and
folded
my
arms
lord
love
me
are
ye
done
martin
o
make
an
end
one
way
or
i
not
be
played
with
verily
you
were
more
dangers
with
the
club
says
he
and
sheathed
his
rapier
as
for
me
espying
the
stool
i
sat
me
down
mighty
dejected
and
full
of
bitter
thoughts
until
feeling
a
touch
on
my
bowed
shoulder
i
looked
up
and
found
him
beside
me
martin
says
he
is
true
you
are
a
fool
but
your
folly
harmeth
none
but
yourself
and
such
honest
fool
that
i
must
needs
love
thee
which
is
strange
yet
so
it
is
we
have
quarrelled
and
fought
very
well
what
to
let
us
from
being
friends
again
but
if
i
doubt
you
adam
why
as
to
that
says
he
with
his
whimsical
look
i
verily
do
think
myself
a
something
doubtful
being
at
times
now
at
this
up
i
rose
and
gripped
his
hand
right
heartily
which
done
he
brought
me
into
the
cave
whiles
godby
posted
himself
on
the
threshold
leaning
on
his
musket
what
now
adam
i
questioned
now
let
us
divide
our
treasure
martin
but
i
bartered
my
share
for
the
lives
of
tush
says
he
and
reaching
a
valise
from
shadowy
corner
he
opened
it
and
i
beheld
such
a
glory
of
flashing
gems
as
nigh
dazzled
me
with
their
splendour
look
at
martin
look
at
he
whispered
here
love
and
hate
life
and
death
every
good
and
all
the
sins
look
at
and
catching
up
a
handful
he
let
them
fall
glittering
through
his
fingers
lord
love
me
martin
he
whispered
is
enough
to
turn
a
man
brain
have
ye
counted
over
comrade
i
never
saw
them
until
this
moment
adam
and
i
confessed
how
in
my
folly
i
had
cast
his
letter
of
instruction
into
the
sea
and
of
how
my
lady
had
found
the
secret
at
her
dire
peril
and
she
never
showed
you
martin
i
was
always
too
busy
busy
says
he
sitting
back
on
his
heels
to
stare
up
at
me
busy
o
lord
love
me
sure
there
not
your
like
i
the
whole
world
martin
which
is
mighty
well
for
the
world
says
i
bitterly
is
vasty
treasure
martin
and
worth
some
little
risk
and
in
the
cave
lie
yet
fifty
and
four
bars
of
gold
and
others
of
silver
with
store
of
doubloons
moidores
and
pieces
of
eight
gold
coins
of
all
countries
there
let
rot
here
more
wealth
than
we
shall
ever
spend
shall
we
divide
it
here
or
aboard
ship
wait
rather
until
we
reach
england
so
be
it
comrade
then
i
minded
to
apportion
a
share
to
godby
here
what
d
say
with
all
my
heart
why
then
is
time
we
got
it
safe
on
board
but
how
to
do
it
what
of
tressady
rogues
adam
having
buried
such
of
themselves
as
needed
it
martin
you
shall
see
playing
on
the
sands
down
yonder
happy
as
any
innocent
and
never
a
firearm
amongst
hist
says
godby
suddenly
alert
the
man
abner
and
his
two
mates
and
where
away
godby
man
hove
to
in
the
lee
o
them
bushes
yonder
is
sly
skulking
rogue
abner
says
adam
closing
and
strapping
the
valise
is
in
my
mind
godby
this
abner
will
never
live
to
see
england
summon
hither
all
three
this
godby
did
forthwith
and
presently
the
three
fellows
appeared
who
knuckling
their
foreheads
made
us
their
several
reverences
what
now
lads
says
adam
viewing
them
with
his
keen
eyes
i
seem
to
mind
your
looks
you
sailed
with
black
bartlemy
aboard
the
i
think
nay
is
no
matter
we
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
we
be
all
marvellous
honest
these
days
the
which
is
well
meantime
take
this
dunnage
down
to
the
boat
and
he
pointed
to
the
valise
hereupon
one
of
the
fellows
took
it
up
and
knuckled
an
eyebrow
to
us
in
turn
we
sail
at
sundown
says
adam
so
godby
you
may
as
well
go
aboard
and
see
that
all
be
ready
aye
aye
says
godby
tightening
the
belt
where
swung
his
great
cutlass
and
shouldering
his
musket
set
off
after
the
three
so
there
goeth
our
fortune
aboard
comrade
and
in
desperate
risky
fashion
adam
in
safe
straightforward
fashion
rather
and
in
broad
daylight
the
which
is
surer
than
stealing
it
aboard
in
the
dark
but
should
these
rogues
guess
what
they
carry
they
wo
martin
and
if
they
should
they
have
but
their
knives
godby
musket
and
pistols
ha
murder
adam
would
you
call
this
murder
comrade
what
other
i
wonder
what
manner
of
man
you
be
away
there
in
england
a
worthy
right
worshipful
justice
o
the
peace
martin
if
providence
seeth
fit
in
laced
coat
and
great
peruke
to
see
that
my
cottages
be
sound
and
wholesome
to
pat
the
touzled
heads
o
the
children
bless
and
to
have
word
with
every
soul
i
the
village
to
snooze
i
my
great
pew
o
sundays
and
dying
at
last
snug
abed
to
leave
behind
me
a
kindly
memory
and
what
for
you
martin
what
see
you
in
the
ship
yonder
god
knoweth
says
i
gloomily
why
not
a
woman
love
comrade
why
not
good
works
rank
and
belike
children
to
honour
your
memory
were
i
but
worthy
all
this
adam
zounds
but
here
humility
yet
your
true
lover
is
ever
humble
heard
so
is
very
well
martin
and
this
doth
mind
me
i
bear
you
a
message
from
my
lady
a
message
from
her
i
cried
gripping
his
arm
out
with
it
man
out
with
it
and
god
forgive
you
this
delay
what
says
my
lady
this
martin
she
would
have
you
shave
according
to
late
custom
why
so
i
will
but
said
she
no
more
aye
something
of
meeting
you
here
so
get
to
your
shaving
and
cheerily
comrade
cheerily
i
to
the
ship
for
at
sunset
is
up
anchor
and
hey
for
england
i
fire
two
guns
to
warn
you
aboard
and
tarry
not
for
the
ship
lieth
within
a
sunken
reef
and
we
must
catch
the
flood
here
he
turned
to
go
then
paused
to
glance
round
the
horizon
with
a
seaman
eye
the
wind
is
fair
to
serve
us
martin
says
he
pinching
his
chin
yet
i
could
wish
for
a
tempest
out
o
the
north
and
a
rising
sea
and
why
adam
in
heaven
name
be
the
sure
and
certain
end
of
tressady
and
mings
comrade
howbeit
what
done
is
done
and
all
things
do
lie
in
the
hands
of
providence
so
do
i
cherish
hope
go
and
shave
martin
go
and
shave
left
alone
i
betook
me
to
my
razors
and
shaved
me
with
unwonted
care
yet
hearkening
for
her
quick
light
step
the
while
scarce
was
my
labour
ended
that
i
thought
to
hear
the
rustle
of
leaves
and
hasted
from
the
cave
calling
on
her
name
and
mighty
joyous
and
eager
damaris
art
here
at
last
dear
my
lady
and
so
came
face
to
face
with
sir
rupert
he
stood
smiling
at
my
discomfiture
yet
his
black
brows
were
close
but
he
halted
and
folded
his
arms
and
i
could
see
the
betraying
bulge
of
the
pistol
on
his
great
for
a
while
he
measured
me
with
his
eye
at
last
he
spoke
within
the
hour
my
lady
brandon
sails
for
england
and
from
this
hour
you
will
forget
my
lady
brandon
ever
existed
or
tush
man
says
i
begone
you
weary
me
or
he
went
on
with
an
airy
gesture
of
his
hand
i
shall
cure
your
weariness
for
good
shoot
me
most
joyfully
whatsoever
hath
chanced
betwixt
you
in
this
wilderness
my
lady
brandon
honour
must
and
warned
by
my
look
he
clapped
hand
to
his
pocket
but
as
he
freed
the
weapon
i
was
upon
him
grasping
his
for
a
moment
we
swayed
together
he
striving
frantically
to
break
my
hold
i
to
wrest
the
weapon
from
him
then
it
exploded
and
uttering
a
sudden
gasp
he
sank
to
the
grass
at
my
feet
and
lay
very
mute
and
still
whilst
i
yet
stared
from
his
pallid
face
to
the
pistol
where
it
had
fallen
i
heard
shouts
a
running
of
feet
and
glancing
up
saw
the
three
gentlemen
his
companions
standing
at
gaze
motionless
then
suddenly
they
turned
and
hasted
away
crying
murder
on
me
as
they
ran
like
one
in
a
dream
i
stared
down
at
sir
rupert
motionless
form
until
i
was
aware
of
my
lady
beside
him
on
her
knees
and
of
the
pallor
of
her
face
as
she
looked
from
him
to
me
her
eyes
wide
with
horror
if
you
have
killed
him
martin
if
you
have
killed
him
here
is
an
end
of
our
happiness
god
forgive
you
now
would
i
have
spoken
but
found
no
words
for
in
this
moment
i
knew
that
sir
rupert
was
surely
dead
dumbly
i
watched
the
passionate
labour
of
her
dexterous
hands
saw
them
pause
at
last
to
clasp
and
wring
themselves
in
helpless
despair
saw
the
three
gentlemen
obedient
to
her
word
stoop
and
lift
that
limp
form
and
bear
it
slowly
away
towards
deliverance
sands
and
she
going
beside
them
now
as
i
stood
watching
her
leave
me
i
heard
the
sudden
roar
of
a
gun
and
glancing
towards
the
ship
saw
they
were
already
making
sail
roused
by
this
i
came
beside
my
lady
and
found
my
voice
at
last
here
was
the
work
of
chance
not
i
damaris
not
i
but
she
gazing
ever
on
that
piteous
limp
form
sought
to
silence
me
with
a
gesture
god
damaris
you
never
doubt
my
word
speak
will
you
not
speak
to
me
he
threatened
me
we
strove
together
and
the
pistol
went
off
in
his
grasp
damned
murderer
cried
one
of
the
gentlemen
after
this
i
held
my
peace
despairing
and
thus
we
went
in
silence
until
before
us
was
deliverance
beach
all
at
once
i
caught
her
up
in
my
arms
and
despite
her
struggles
began
to
bear
her
back
up
the
ascent
for
a
moment
only
she
strove
uttering
no
word
then
hiding
her
face
against
me
suffered
me
to
bear
her
where
i
would
but
now
i
heard
shouts
and
cries
that
told
me
i
was
pursued
you
are
mine
damaris
i
cried
mine
henceforth
and
no
man
shall
take
you
from
me
whiles
i
live
despite
my
haste
the
noise
of
pursuit
waxed
louder
spurring
me
to
greater
effort
and
now
it
became
the
end
and
aim
of
my
existence
to
reach
the
cave
in
time
wherefore
i
began
to
run
on
and
up
until
my
breath
came
in
great
panting
sobs
my
heart
seemed
bursting
and
in
my
throbbing
brain
a
confusion
of
wild
thoughts
better
die
thus
my
love
upon
my
heart
the
ship
shall
sail
without
us
the
door
of
the
cave
is
stout
god
be
thanked
and
firing
from
the
loophole
i
may
withstand
them
all
breathless
and
reeling
i
gained
the
plateau
at
last
but
as
i
staggered
towards
the
cave
i
tripped
and
fell
heavily
crushing
her
beneath
me
but
i
struggled
up
and
bearing
her
within
the
cave
laid
her
upon
my
bed
and
closing
the
door
barred
it
then
i
reached
my
muskets
from
their
rack
and
set
them
in
readiness
this
done
and
finding
my
lady
so
still
and
silent
i
came
to
view
her
where
she
lay
and
peering
in
the
dimness
uttered
a
great
cry
to
see
the
pale
oval
of
cheek
horribly
bedabbled
with
blood
trembling
in
a
sickness
of
fear
i
sank
beside
her
on
my
knees
then
seeing
she
yet
breathed
i
parted
the
silky
hair
above
her
temple
and
so
came
on
a
cruel
gash
now
as
i
strove
to
staunch
this
precious
blood
i
heard
again
the
echoing
thunder
of
a
gun
damaris
says
i
clasping
her
to
me
and
kissing
her
pallid
lips
o
damaris
they
are
summoning
us
to
england
d
hear
beloved
d
hear
well
they
shall
call
in
vain
they
shall
sail
without
us
love
hath
found
us
and
here
with
love
will
we
abide
wake
beloved
wake
and
tell
me
you
would
have
it
so
but
save
for
her
breathing
and
despite
all
my
pleading
and
caresses
she
lay
like
one
dead
so
i
brought
water
and
bathed
her
face
and
throat
and
wrists
yet
all
to
no
purpose
so
that
fear
grew
to
agony
how
if
she
die
thus
thinks
i
why
then
i
can
die
likewise
but
again
how
if
she
wake
and
finding
the
ship
gone
despise
me
and
in
place
of
her
lover
look
on
me
as
her
gaoler
for
a
long
while
i
crouched
there
my
head
bowed
on
my
fists
since
well
i
knew
that
england
might
shelter
me
nevermore
and
yet
to
part
with
her
that
was
become
my
very
life
as
i
knelt
thus
in
an
agony
of
indecision
was
sudden
tumult
of
knocking
upon
the
door
and
the
sound
of
fierce
voices
come
forth
murderer
open
to
us
rogue
open
but
still
i
knelt
there
heeding
only
the
hurry
of
my
thoughts
how
if
the
ship
sail
without
us
how
if
she
wake
and
know
me
for
her
gaoler
how
might
i
endure
loneliness
how
part
with
her
that
was
become
my
life
belike
she
might
not
hate
me
open
murderer
open
roared
the
voices
a
murderer
how
if
she
believe
this
better
loneliness
and
death
than
to
read
horror
of
me
in
her
every
look
and
now
beyond
the
door
was
silence
and
then
i
heard
adam
hailing
me
oho
shipmate
unbar
tide
on
the
turn
and
we
must
aboard
and
trust
me
martin
for
your
comrade
as
will
see
justice
done
ye
so
come
martin
you
and
my
lady
and
let
aboard
aye
aye
adam
quoth
i
better
die
o
solitude
than
live
with
a
breaking
heart
so
cheerily
it
is
adam
then
rising
i
took
my
dear
lady
in
my
arms
and
holding
her
against
my
heart
i
kissed
her
hair
her
closed
eyes
her
pale
unresponsive
lips
and
bearing
her
to
the
door
contrived
to
open
it
and
stepped
forth
of
the
cave
and
here
i
found
adam
pistol
in
hand
with
divers
of
his
fellows
and
the
three
gentlemen
who
scowled
amain
yet
eyeing
weapon
did
no
more
than
clench
their
fists
and
mutter
of
gibbets
and
the
like
look
you
adam
says
i
my
lady
is
stunned
of
a
fall
but
be
no
great
matter
once
we
come
aboard
let
us
go
why
then
lord
love
you
martin
hasten
says
he
for
tide
falling
and
it
all
we
shall
do
to
clear
the
reef
reaching
deliverance
sands
i
saw
the
boat
already
launched
and
manned
and
wading
into
the
water
laid
my
lady
in
the
stern
sheets
come
cried
adam
reaching
me
his
hand
in
with
ye
man
not
i
adam
why

comrade
says
he
staring
now
my
hand
adam
and
a
prosperous
voyage
how
comrade
will
ye
stay
marooned
in
this
desolation
and
he
stooped
to
peer
down
at
me
martin
says
he
gripping
my
hand
and
staring
into
my
eyes
doth
this
mean
you
are
safer
here
by
reason
of
the
mystery
of
sir
rupert
sudden
end
mayhap
says
i
and
loosed
his
hand
what
think
you
that
you
are
no
murderer
comrade
nor
ever
will
be
my
lady
said
as
much
once
farewell
adam
and
i
waded
back
to
the
beach
give
way
lads
cries
he
give
way
i
heard
the
splash
and
beat
of
their
oars
and
when
i
turned
to
look
i
saw
them
across
the
lagoon
then
i
turned
and
wandered
aimlessly
along
these
white
sands
that
had
known
so
often
the
light
tread
of
her
pretty
feet
very
slowly
i
went
with
eyes
that
saw
not
ears
that
heard
not
and
my
mind
a
confusion
of
bitter
thoughts
at
last
i
reached
the
little
plateau
and
from
this
eminence
beheld
the
ship
standing
away
under
a
press
of
sail
and
saw
that
night
was
at
hand
suddenly
as
i
watched
the
ship
her
lofty
masts
and
gleaming
canvas
swam
all
blurred
and
misty
on
my
sight
and
sinking
to
my
knees
i
bowed
my
head
almighty
god
says
i
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
the
wonder
of
love
and
the
heaven
it
might
have
been
but
since
love
is
not
for
me
teach
me
how
i
may
be
avenged
but
now
even
as
i
prayed
thus
my
voice
brake
upon
a
great
sob
insomuch
that
i
might
pray
no
more
therefore
i
cast
myself
upon
my
face
forgetting
all
things
but
my
great
and
bitter
loneliness
and
so
came
night
and
shut
me
in
here
then
i
make
an
end
of
this
narrative
of
black
bartlemy
treasure
but
how
and
in
what
manner
i
came
to
my
vengeance
is
yet
to
tell
