brief
biographical
sketch
charles
ives
was
probably
one
of
the
most
brilliant
imaginative
and
flexible
americans
to
ever
walk
the
land
of
freedom
a
graduate
of
yale
he
became
a
in
the
american
insurance
industry
introducing
brilliant
innovations
within
that
industry
he
also
unlike
a
few
composers
found
the
time
and
the
money
being
a
shrewd
and
practical
businessman
to
get
married
and
have
children
his
accomplishments
for
which
he
is
best
known
however
are
those
in
the
field
of
music
at
the
time
of
its
composition
ives
music
was
probably
the
most
radically
modern
in
history
and
by
itself
had
enough
material
to
serve
as
the
foundation
of
modern
century
music
for
example
at
the
turn
of
the
century
this
eccentric
composer
created
band
works
featuring
multiple
melodies
of
multiple
time
signatures
opposing
and
complimenting
each
other
within
the
same
piece
ives
was
also
a
revolutionary
atonal
composer
who
created
essentially
without
precedent
many
atonal
works
that
not
only
those
of
schoenberg
but
are
just
as
sophisticated
and
arguably
even
more
so
than
those
of
the
serialist
among
those
atonal
works
was
his
second
concord
piano
sonata
one
of
the
finest
and
some
would
say
the
finest
works
of
classical
music
by
an
american
it
reflects
the
musical
innovations
of
its
creator
featuring
revolutionary
atmospheric
effects
unprecedented
atonal
musical
syntax
and
surprising
technical
approaches
to
playing
the
piano
such
as
pressing
down
on
over
notes
simultaneously
using
a
flat
piece
of
wood
what
a
mischievious
creative
genius
and
yet
despite
the
musically
innovative
nature
of
these
works
from
a
thematic
standpoint
they
are
strictly
century
ives
like
american
sousa
consciously
infused
patriotic
or
themes
into
his
pieces
in
the
concord
he
attempted
to
project
within
the
music
the
century
philosophical
ideas
of
the
american
transcendentalists
who
obviously
had
a
great
impact
on
his
thus
while
other
atonal
composers
such
as
schoenberg
or
berg
attempted
to
infuse
their
music
with
century
themes
of
hostility
violence
and
estrangement
within
their
atonal
music
the
atonal
music
of
ives
is
from
a
thematic
standpoint
really
quite
tonal
ives
wrote
the
following
essays
as
a
very
big
set
of
program
notes
to
accompany
his
second
piano
sonata
here
he
puts
forth
his
elaborate
theory
of
music
and
what
it
represents
and
discusses
transcendental
philosophy
and
its
relation
to
music
the
essays
explain
ives
own
philosophy
of
and
understanding
of
music
and
art
they
also
serve
as
an
analysis
of
music
itself
as
an
artform
and
provide
a
critical
explanation
of
the
concord
and
the
role
that
the
philosophies
of
emerson
hawthorne
thoreau
and
the
alcotts
play
in
forming
its
thematic
structure

introductory
footnote
by
charles
ives
these
prefatory
essays
were
written
by
the
composer
for
those
who
ca
stand
his
music
and
the
music
for
those
who
ca
stand
his
essays
to
those
who
ca
stand
either
the
whole
is
respectfully
dedicated
introduction
the
following
pages
were
written
primarily
as
a
preface
or
reason
for
the
writer
second
pianoforte
sonata
concord
a
group
of
four
pieces
called
a
sonata
for
want
of
a
more
exact
name
as
the
form
perhaps
substance
does
not
justify
it
the
music
and
prefaces
were
intended
to
be
printed
together
but
as
it
was
found
that
this
would
make
a
cumbersome
volume
they
are
separate
the
whole
is
an
attempt
to
present
one
person
impression
of
the
spirit
of
transcendentalism
that
is
associated
in
the
minds
of
many
with
concord
of
over
a
half
century
ago
this
is
undertaken
in
impressionistic
pictures
of
emerson
and
thoreau
a
sketch
of
the
alcotts
and
a
scherzo
supposed
to
reflect
a
lighter
quality
which
is
often
found
in
the
fantastic
side
of
hawthorne
the
first
and
last
movements
do
not
aim
to
give
any
programs
of
the
life
or
of
any
particular
work
of
either
emerson
or
thoreau
but
rather
composite
pictures
or
impressions
they
are
however
so
general
in
outline
that
from
some
viewpoints
they
may
be
as
far
from
accepted
impressions
from
true
conceptions
for
that
matter
as
the
valuation
which
they
purport
to
be
of
the
influence
of
the
life
thought
and
character
of
emerson
and
thoreau
is
inadequate
i
prologue
how
far
is
anyone
justified
be
he
an
authority
or
a
layman
in
expressing
or
trying
to
express
in
terms
of
music
in
sounds
if
you
like
the
value
of
anything
material
moral
intellectual
or
spiritual
which
is
usually
expressed
in
terms
other
than
music
how
far
afield
can
music
go
and
keep
honest
as
well
as
reasonable
or
artistic
is
it
a
matter
limited
only
by
the
composer
power
of
expressing
what
lies
in
his
subjective
or
objective
consciousness
or
is
it
limited
by
any
limitations
of
the
composer
can
a
tune
literally
represent
a
stonewall
with
vines
on
it
or
with
nothing
on
it
though
it
the
tune
be
made
by
a
genius
whose
power
of
objective
contemplation
is
in
the
highest
state
of
development
can
it
be
done
by
anything
short
of
an
act
of
mesmerism
on
the
part
of
the
composer
or
an
act
of
kindness
on
the
part
of
the
listener
does
the
extreme
materializing
of
music
appeal
strongly
to
anyone
except
to
those
without
a
sense
of
humor
or
rather
with
a
sense
of
humor
or
except
possibly
to
those
who
might
excuse
it
as
herbert
spencer
might
by
the
theory
that
the
sensational
element
the
sensations
we
hear
so
much
about
in
experimental
psychology
is
the
true
pleasurable
phenomenon
in
music
and
that
the
mind
should
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
does
the
success
of
program
music
depend
more
upon
the
program
than
upon
the
music
if
it
does
what
is
the
use
of
the
music
if
it
does
not
what
is
the
use
of
the
program
does
not
its
appeal
depend
to
a
great
extent
on
the
listener
willingness
to
accept
the
theory
that
music
is
the
language
of
the
emotions
and
only
that
or
inversely
does
not
this
theory
tend
to
limit
music
to
programs
a
limitation
as
bad
for
music
itself
for
its
wholesome
progress
as
a
diet
of
program
music
is
bad
for
the
listener
ability
to
digest
anything
beyond
the
sensuous
or
to
a
great
extent
this
depends
on
what
is
meant
by
emotion
or
on
the
assumption
that
the
word
as
used
above
refers
more
to
the
expression
of
rather
than
to
a
meaning
in
a
deeper
sense
which
may
be
a
feeling
influenced
by
some
experience
perhaps
of
a
spiritual
nature
in
the
expression
of
which
the
intellect
has
some
part
the
nearer
we
get
to
the
mere
expression
of
emotion
says
professor
sturt
in
his
philosophy
of
art
and
personality
as
in
the
antics
of
boys
who
have
been
promised
a
holiday
the
further
we
get
away
from
art
on
the
other
hand
is
not
all
music
is
not
pure
music
so
called
representative
in
its
essence
is
it
not
raised
to
the
nth
power
or
rather
reduced
to
the
minus
nth
power
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
expression
of
subjective
and
objective
emotion
it
is
easier
to
know
what
each
is
than
when
each
becomes
what
it
is
the
separateness
of
art
theory
that
art
is
not
life
but
a
reflection
of
it
that
art
is
not
vital
to
life
but
that
life
is
vital
to
it
does
not
help
us
nor
does
thoreau
who
says
not
that
life
is
art
but
that
life
is
an
art
which
of
course
is
a
different
thing
than
the
foregoing
tolstoi
is
even
more
helpless
to
himself
and
to
us
for
he
eliminates
further
from
his
definition
of
art
we
may
learn
little
more
than
that
a
kick
in
the
back
is
a
work
of
art
and
beethoven
symphony
is
not
experiences
are
passed
on
from
one
man
to
another
abel
knew
that
and
now
we
know
it
but
where
is
the
bridge
placed
at
the
end
of
the
road
or
only
at
the
end
of
our
vision
is
it
all
a
bridge
or
is
there
no
bridge
because
there
is
no
gulf
suppose
that
a
composer
writes
a
piece
of
music
conscious
that
he
is
inspired
say
by
witnessing
an
act
of
great
another
piece
by
the
contemplation
of
a
certain
trait
of
nobility
he
perceives
in
a
friend
character
and
another
by
the
sight
of
a
mountain
lake
under
moonlight
the
first
two
from
an
inspirational
standpoint
would
naturally
seem
to
come
under
the
subjective
and
the
last
under
the
objective
yet
the
chances
are
there
is
something
of
the
quality
of
both
in
all
there
may
have
been
in
the
first
instance
physical
action
so
intense
or
so
dramatic
in
character
that
the
remembrance
of
it
aroused
a
great
deal
more
objective
emotion
than
the
composer
was
conscious
of
while
writing
the
music
in
the
third
instance
the
music
may
have
been
influenced
strongly
though
subconsciously
by
a
vague
remembrance
of
certain
thoughts
and
feelings
perhaps
of
a
deep
religious
or
spiritual
nature
which
suddenly
came
to
him
upon
realizing
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
which
overpowered
the
first
sensuous
pleasure
perhaps
some
such
feeling
as
of
the
conviction
of
immortality
that
thoreau
experienced
and
tells
about
in
walden
i
penetrated
to
those
meadows
when
the
wild
river
and
the
woods
were
bathed
in
so
pure
and
bright
a
light
as
would
have
waked
the
dead
if
they
had
been
slumbering
in
their
graves
as
some
suppose
there
needs
no
stronger
proof
of
immortality
enthusiasm
must
permeate
it
but
what
it
is
that
inspires
an
is
not
easily
determined
much
less
classified
the
word
inspire
is
used
here
in
the
sense
of
cause
rather
than
effect
a
critic
may
say
that
a
certain
movement
is
not
inspired
but
that
may
be
a
matter
of
taste
perhaps
the
most
inspired
music
sounds
the
least
so
to
the
critic
a
true
inspiration
may
lack
a
true
expression
unless
it
is
assumed
that
if
an
inspiration
is
not
true
enough
to
produce
a
true
expression
if
there
be
anyone
who
can
definitely
determine
what
a
true
expression
is
it
is
not
an
inspiration
at
all
again
suppose
the
same
composer
at
another
time
writes
a
piece
of
equal
merit
to
the
other
three
as
estimates
go
but
holds
that
he
is
not
conscious
of
what
inspired
it
that
he
had
nothing
definite
in
mind
that
he
was
not
aware
of
any
mental
image
or
process
that
naturally
the
actual
work
in
creating
something
gave
him
a
satisfying
feeling
of
pleasure
perhaps
of
elation
what
will
you
substitute
for
the
mountain
lake
for
his
friend
character
will
you
substitute
anything
if
so
why
if
so
what
or
is
it
enough
to
let
the
matter
rest
on
the
pleasure
mainly
physical
of
the
tones
their
color
succession
and
relations
formal
or
informal
can
an
inspiration
come
from
a
blank
mind
well
he
tries
to
explain
and
says
that
he
was
conscious
of
some
emotional
excitement
and
of
a
sense
of
something
beautiful
he
does
know
exactly
what
a
vague
feeling
of
exaltation
or
perhaps
of
profound
sadness
what
is
the
source
of
these
instinctive
feelings
these
vague
intuitions
and
introspective
sensations
the
more
we
try
to
analyze
the
more
vague
they
become
to
pull
them
apart
and
classify
them
as
subjective
or
objective
or
as
this
or
as
that
means
that
they
may
be
well
classified
and
that
is
about
all
it
leaves
us
as
far
from
the
origin
as
ever
what
does
it
all
mean
what
is
behind
it
all
the
voice
of
god
says
the
artist
the
voice
of
the
devil
says
the
man
in
the
front
row
are
we
because
we
are
human
beings
born
with
the
power
of
innate
perception
of
the
beautiful
in
the
abstract
so
that
an
inspiration
can
arise
through
no
external
stimuli
of
sensation
or
experience
no
association
with
the
outward
or
was
there
present
in
the
above
instance
some
kind
of
subconscious
instantaneous
composite
image
of
all
the
mountain
lakes
this
man
had
ever
seen
blended
as
kind
of
overtones
with
the
various
traits
of
nobility
of
many
of
his
friends
embodied
in
one
personality
do
all
inspirational
images
states
conditions
or
whatever
they
may
be
truly
called
have
for
a
dominant
part
if
not
for
a
source
some
actual
experience
in
life
or
of
the
social
relation
to
think
that
they
do
not
always
at
least
would
be
a
relief
but
as
we
are
trying
to
consider
music
made
and
heard
by
human
beings
and
not
by
birds
or
angels
it
seems
difficult
to
suppose
that
even
subconscious
images
can
be
separated
from
some
human
experience
there
must
be
something
behind
subconsciousness
to
produce
consciousness
and
so
on
but
whatever
the
elements
and
origin
of
these
images
are
that
they
do
stir
deep
emotional
feelings
and
encourage
their
expression
is
a
part
of
the
unknowable
we
know
they
do
often
arouse
something
that
has
not
yet
passed
the
border
line
between
subconsciousness
and
consciousness
an
artistic
intuition
well
named
but
object
and
cause
unknown
here
is
a
program
conscious
or
subconscious
what
does
it
matter
why
try
to
trace
any
stream
that
flows
through
the
garden
of
consciousness
to
its
source
only
to
be
confronted
by
another
problem
of
tracing
this
source
to
its
source
perhaps
emerson
in
the
answers
by
not
trying
to
explain
that
if
eyes
were
made
for
seeing
then
beauty
is
its
own
excuse
for
being
why
thou
wert
there
o
rival
of
the
rose
i
never
thought
to
ask
i
never
knew
but
in
my
simple
ignorance
suppose
the
power
that
brought
me
there
brought
you
perhaps
sturt
answers
by
substitution
we
can
not
explain
the
origin
of
an
artistic
intuition
any
more
than
the
origin
of
any
other
primary
function
of
our
nature
but
if
as
i
believe
civilization
is
mainly
founded
on
those
kinds
of
unselfish
human
interests
which
we
call
knowledge
and
morality
it
is
easily
intelligible
that
we
should
have
a
parallel
interest
which
we
call
art
closely
akin
and
lending
powerful
support
to
the
other
two
it
is
intelligible
too
that
moral
goodness
intellectual
power
high
vitality
and
strength
should
be
approved
by
the
intuition
this
reduces
or
rather
brings
the
problem
back
to
a
tangible
basis
namely
the
translation
of
an
artistic
intuition
into
musical
sounds
approving
and
reflecting
or
endeavoring
to
approve
and
reflect
a
moral
goodness
a
high
vitality
or
any
other
human
attribute
mental
moral
or
spiritual
can
music
do
more
than
this
can
it
do
this
and
if
so
who
and
what
is
to
determine
the
degree
of
its
failure
or
success
the
composer
the
performer
if
there
be
any
or
those
who
have
to
listen
one
hearing
or
a
century
of
hearings
if
it
is
successful
or
if
it
fail
what
matters
it
the
fear
of
failure
need
keep
no
one
from
the
attempt
for
if
the
composer
is
sensitive
he
need
but
launch
forth
a
countercharge
of
being
misunderstood
and
hide
behind
it
a
theme
that
the
composer
sets
up
as
moral
goodness
may
sound
like
high
vitality
to
his
friend
and
but
like
an
outburst
of
nervous
weakness
or
only
a
stagnant
pool
to
those
not
even
his
enemies
expression
to
a
great
extent
is
a
matter
of
terms
and
terms
are
anyone
the
meaning
of
god
may
have
a
billion
interpretations
if
there
be
that
many
souls
in
the
world
there
is
a
moral
in
the
nominalist
and
realist
that
will
prove
all
sums
it
runs
something
like
this
no
matter
how
sincere
and
confidential
men
are
in
trying
to
know
or
assuming
that
they
do
know
each
other
mood
and
habits
of
thought
the
net
result
leaves
a
feeling
that
all
is
left
unsaid
for
the
reason
of
their
incapacity
to
know
each
other
though
they
use
the
same
words
they
go
on
from
one
explanation
to
another
but
things
seem
to
stand
about
as
they
did
in
the
beginning
because
of
that
vicious
assumption
but
we
would
rather
believe
that
music
is
beyond
any
analogy
to
word
language
and
that
the
time
is
coming
but
not
in
our
lifetime
when
it
will
develop
possibilities
unconceivable
now
a
language
so
transcendent
that
its
heights
and
depths
will
be
common
to
all
mankind
ii
emerson
it
has
seemed
to
the
writer
that
emerson
is
greater
his
identity
more
complete
perhaps
in
the
realms
of
revelation
natural
disclosure
than
in
those
of
poetry
philosophy
or
prophecy
though
a
great
poet
and
prophet
he
is
greater
possibly
as
an
invader
of
the
unknown
america
deepest
explorer
of
the
spiritual
immensities
a
seer
painting
his
discoveries
in
masses
and
with
any
color
that
may
lie
at
hand
cosmic
religious
human
even
sensuous
a
recorder
freely
describing
the
inevitable
struggle
in
the
soul
uprise
perceiving
from
this
inward
source
alone
that
every
ultimate
fact
is
only
the
first
of
a
new
series
a
discoverer
whose
heart
knows
with
voltaire
that
man
seriously
reflects
when
left
alone
and
would
then
discover
if
he
can
that
wondrous
chain
which
links
the
heavens
with
earth
the
world
of
beings
subject
to
one
law
in
his
reflections
emerson
unlike
plato
is
not
afraid
to
ride
arion
dolphin
and
to
go
wherever
he
is
carried
to
parnassus
or
to
musketaquid
we
see
him
standing
on
a
summit
at
the
door
of
the
infinite
where
many
men
do
not
care
to
climb
peering
into
the
mysteries
of
life
contemplating
the
eternities
hurling
back
whatever
he
discovers
there
now
thunderbolts
for
us
to
grasp
if
we
can
and
translate
now
placing
quietly
even
tenderly
in
our
hands
things
that
we
may
see
without
effort
if
we
wo
see
them
so
much
the
worse
for
us
we
see
him
a
so
intensely
on
the
lookout
for
the
trail
of
his
star
that
he
has
no
time
to
stop
and
retrace
his
footprints
which
may
often
seem
indistinct
to
his
followers
who
find
it
easier
and
perhaps
safer
to
keep
their
eyes
on
the
ground
and
there
is
a
chance
that
this
guide
could
not
always
retrace
his
steps
if
he
tried
and
why
should
he
he
is
on
the
road
conscious
only
that
though
his
star
may
not
lie
within
walking
distance
he
must
reach
it
before
his
wagon
can
be
hitched
to
it
a
prometheus
illuminating
a
privilege
of
the
gods
lighting
a
fuse
that
is
laid
towards
men
emerson
reveals
the
less
not
by
an
analysis
of
itself
but
by
bringing
men
towards
the
greater
he
does
not
try
to
reveal
personally
but
leads
rather
to
a
field
where
revelation
is
a
where
it
is
known
by
the
perceptions
of
the
soul
towards
the
absolute
law
he
leads
us
towards
this
law
which
is
a
realization
of
what
experience
has
suggested
and
philosophy
hoped
for
he
leads
us
conscious
that
the
aspects
of
truth
as
he
sees
them
may
change
as
often
as
truth
remains
constant
revelation
perhaps
is
but
prophecy
intensified
the
intensifying
of
its
as
well
as
its
steeple
simple
prophecy
while
concerned
with
the
past
reveals
but
the
future
while
revelation
is
concerned
with
all
time
the
power
in
emerson
prophecy
confuses
it
with
or
at
least
makes
it
seem
to
approach
revelation
it
is
prophecy
with
no
time
element
emerson
tells
as
few
bards
could
of
what
will
happen
in
the
past
for
his
future
is
eternity
and
the
past
is
a
part
of
that
and
so
like
all
true
prophets
he
is
always
modern
and
will
grow
modern
with
the
years
for
his
substance
is
not
relative
but
a
measure
of
eternal
truths
determined
rather
by
a
universalist
than
by
a
partialist
he
measured
as
michel
angelo
said
true
artists
should
with
the
eye
and
not
the
hand
but
to
attribute
modernism
to
his
substance
though
not
to
his
expression
is
an
anachronism
and
as
futile
as
calling
today
sunset
modern
as
revelation
and
prophecy
in
their
common
acceptance
are
resolved
by
man
from
the
absolute
and
universal
to
the
relative
and
personal
and
as
emerson
tendency
is
fundamentally
the
opposite
it
is
easier
safer
and
so
apparently
clearer
to
think
of
him
as
a
poet
of
natural
and
revealed
philosophy
and
as
such
a
prophet
but
not
one
to
be
confused
with
those
singing
soothsayers
whose
pockets
are
filled
as
are
the
pockets
of
and
radical
demagoguery
in
pulpit
bank
and
columns
with
dogmatic
emerson
as
a
prophet
in
these
lower
heights
was
a
conservative
in
that
he
seldom
lost
his
head
and
a
radical
in
that
he
seldom
cared
whether
he
lost
it
or
not
he
was
a
born
radical
as
are
all
true
conservatives
he
was
too
much
absorbed
by
the
absolute
too
much
of
the
universal
to
be
either
though
he
could
be
both
at
once
to
cotton
mather
he
would
have
been
a
demagogue
to
a
real
demagogue
he
would
not
be
understood
as
it
was
with
no
self
interest
that
he
laid
his
hand
on
reality
the
nearer
any
subject
or
an
attribute
of
it
approaches
to
the
perfect
truth
at
its
base
the
more
does
qualification
become
necessary
radicalism
must
always
qualify
itself
emerson
clarifies
as
he
qualifies
by
plunging
into
rather
than
emerging
from
carlyle
labyrinths
of
speculative
radicalism
the
radicalism
that
we
hear
much
about
today
is
not
emerson
kind
but
of
thinner
fiber
it
qualifies
itself
by
going
to
root
and
often
cutting
other
roots
in
the
process
it
is
usually
impotent
as
dynamite
in
its
cause
and
sometimes
as
harmful
to
the
wholesome
progress
of
all
causes
it
is
qualified
by
its
failure
but
the
radicalism
of
emerson
plunges
to
all
roots
it
becomes
greater
than
itself
greater
than
all
its
formal
or
informal
doctrines
too
advanced
and
too
conservative
for
any
specific
result
too
catholic
for
all
the
churches
for
the
nearer
it
is
to
truth
the
farther
it
is
from
a
truth
and
the
more
it
is
qualified
by
its
future
possibilities
hence
comes
the
difficulty
the
futility
of
attempting
to
fasten
on
emerson
any
particular
doctrine
philosophic
or
religious
theory
emerson
wrings
the
neck
of
any
law
that
would
become
exclusive
and
arrogant
whether
a
definite
one
of
metaphysics
or
an
indefinite
one
of
mechanics
he
hacks
his
way
up
and
down
as
near
as
he
can
to
the
absolute
the
oneness
of
all
nature
both
human
and
spiritual
and
to
god
benevolence
to
him
the
ultimate
of
a
conception
is
its
vastness
and
it
is
probably
this
rather
than
the
in
his
expression
that
makes
us
incline
to
go
with
him
but
and
then
stand
and
build
dogmas
but
if
we
can
not
follow
all
the
way
if
we
do
not
always
clearly
perceive
the
whole
picture
we
are
at
least
free
to
imagine
it
he
makes
us
feel
that
we
are
free
to
do
so
perhaps
that
is
the
most
he
asks
for
he
is
but
reaching
out
through
and
beyond
mankind
trying
to
see
what
he
can
of
the
infinite
and
its
immensities
throwing
back
to
us
whatever
he
can
but
ever
conscious
that
he
but
occasionally
catches
a
glimpse
conscious
that
if
he
would
contemplate
the
greater
he
must
wrestle
with
the
lesser
even
though
it
dims
an
outline
that
he
must
struggle
if
he
would
hurl
back
anything
even
a
broken
fragment
for
men
to
examine
and
perchance
in
it
find
a
germ
of
some
part
of
truth
conscious
at
times
of
the
futility
of
his
effort
and
its
message
conscious
of
its
vagueness
but
ever
hopeful
for
it
and
confident
that
its
foundation
if
not
its
medium
is
somewhere
near
the
eventual
and
absolute
good
the
divine
truth
underlying
all
life
if
emerson
must
be
dubbed
an
optimist
then
an
optimist
fighting
pessimism
but
not
wallowing
in
it
an
optimist
who
does
not
study
pessimism
by
learning
to
enjoy
it
whose
imagination
is
greater
than
his
curiosity
who
seeing
the
to
erebus
is
strong
enough
to
go
the
other
way
this
strength
of
optimism
indeed
the
strength
we
find
always
underlying
his
tolerance
his
radicalism
his
searches
prophecies
and
revelations
is
heightened
and
made
efficient
by
a
thing
concerned
not
with
the
combining
but
the
apprehending
of
things
a
possession
akin
to
the
power
ruskin
says
all
great
pictures
have
which
depends
on
the
penetration
of
the
imagination
into
the
true
nature
of
the
thing
represented
and
on
the
scorn
of
the
imagination
for
all
shackles
and
fetters
of
mere
external
fact
that
stand
in
the
way
of
its
suggestiveness
a
possession
which
gives
the
strength
of
distance
to
his
eyes
and
the
strength
of
muscle
to
his
soul
with
this
he
slashes
down
through
the
loam
nor
would
he
have
us
rest
there
if
we
would
dig
deep
enough
only
to
plant
a
doctrine
from
one
part
of
him
he
would
show
us
the
in
that
furrow
if
we
would
creed
his
compensation
there
is
hardly
a
sentence
that
could
not
wreck
it
or
could
not
show
that
the
idea
is
no
tenet
of
a
philosophy
but
a
clear
though
perhaps
not
clearly
hurled
on
the
canvas
illustration
of
universal
justice
of
god
perfect
balances
a
story
of
the
analogy
or
better
the
identity
of
polarity
and
duality
in
nature
with
that
in
morality
the
essay
is
no
more
a
doctrine
than
the
law
of
gravitation
is
if
we
would
stop
and
attribute
too
much
to
genius
he
shows
us
that
what
is
best
written
or
done
by
genius
in
the
world
was
no
one
work
but
came
by
wide
social
labor
when
a
thousand
wrought
like
one
sharing
the
same
impulse
if
we
would
find
in
his
essay
on
montaigne
a
biography
we
are
shown
a
biography
of
scepticism
and
in
reducing
this
to
relation
between
sensation
and
the
morals
we
are
shown
a
true
montaigne
we
know
the
man
better
perhaps
by
this
less
presentation
if
we
would
stop
and
trust
heavily
on
the
harvest
of
originality
he
shows
us
that
this
plant
this
part
of
the
garden
is
but
a
relative
thing
it
is
dependent
also
on
the
richness
that
ages
have
put
into
the
soil
every
thinker
is
retrospective
thus
is
emerson
always
beating
down
through
the
crust
towards
the
first
fire
of
life
of
death
and
of
eternity
read
where
you
will
each
sentence
seems
not
to
point
to
the
next
but
to
the
undercurrent
of
all
if
you
would
label
his
a
religion
of
ethics
or
of
morals
he
shames
you
at
the
outset
for
ethics
is
but
a
reflection
of
a
divine
personality
all
the
religions
this
world
has
ever
known
have
been
but
the
aftermath
of
the
ethics
of
one
or
another
holy
person
as
soon
as
character
appears
be
sure
love
will
the
intuition
of
the
moral
sentiment
is
but
the
insight
of
the
perfection
of
the
laws
of
the
soul
but
these
laws
can
not
be
catalogued
if
a
versatilist
a
modern
goethe
for
instance
could
put
all
of
emerson
admonitions
into
practice
a
constant
permanence
would
result
an
eternal
a
focus
of
equal
even
the
value
or
success
of
but
one
precept
is
dependent
like
that
of
a
as
much
on
the
as
on
the
the
inactivity
of
permanence
is
what
emerson
will
not
permit
he
will
not
accept
repose
against
the
activity
of
truth
but
this
almost
constant
resolution
of
every
insight
towards
the
absolute
may
get
a
little
on
one
nerves
if
one
is
at
all
to
the
specific
one
begins
to
ask
what
is
the
absolute
anyway
and
why
try
to
look
clear
through
the
eternities
and
the
unknowable
even
out
of
the
other
end
fondness
for
flying
to
definite
heights
on
indefinite
wings
and
the
tendency
to
becomes
unsatisfying
to
the
impatient
who
want
results
to
come
as
they
walk
probably
this
is
a
reason
that
it
is
occasionally
said
that
emerson
has
no
vital
message
for
the
rank
and
file
he
has
no
definite
message
perhaps
for
the
literal
but
messages
are
all
vital
as
much
by
reason
of
his
indefiniteness
as
in
spite
of
it
there
is
a
suggestion
of
irony
in
the
thought
that
the
power
of
his
vague
but
compelling
vitality
which
ever
sweeps
us
on
in
spite
of
ourselves
might
not
have
been
his
if
it
had
not
been
for
those
definite
religious
doctrines
of
the
old
new
england
theologians
for
almost
two
centuries
emerson
mental
and
spiritual
muscles
had
been
in
training
for
him
in
the
moral
and
intellectual
contentions
a
part
of
the
religious
exercise
of
his
forebears
a
kind
of
higher
sensitiveness
seems
to
culminate
in
him
it
gives
him
a
power
of
searching
for
a
wider
freedom
of
soul
than
theirs
the
religion
of
puritanism
was
based
to
a
great
extent
on
a
search
for
the
unknowable
limited
only
by
the
dogma
of
its
theology
a
search
for
a
path
so
that
the
soul
could
better
be
conducted
to
the
next
world
while
transcendentalism
was
based
on
the
wider
search
for
the
unknowable
unlimited
in
any
way
or
by
anything
except
the
vast
bounds
of
innate
goodness
as
it
might
be
revealed
to
him
in
any
phenomena
of
man
nature
or
god
this
distinction
tenuous
in
spite
of
the
words
we
like
to
believe
has
something
peculiar
to
emerson
in
it
we
like
to
feel
that
it
superimposes
the
one
that
makes
all
transcendentalism
but
an
intellectual
state
based
on
the
theory
of
innate
ideas
the
reality
of
thought
and
the
necessity
of
its
freedom
for
the
philosophy
of
the
religion
or
whatever
you
will
call
it
of
the
concord
transcendentalists
is
at
least
more
than
an
intellectual
state
it
has
even
some
of
the
functions
of
the
puritan
church
it
is
a
spiritual
state
in
which
both
soul
and
mind
can
better
conduct
themselves
in
this
world
and
also
in
the
next
when
the
time
comes
the
search
of
the
puritan
was
rather
along
the
path
of
logic
spiritualized
and
the
transcendentalist
of
reason
spiritualized
a
difference
in
a
broad
sense
between
objective
and
subjective
contemplation
the
dislike
of
inactivity
repose
and
barter
drives
one
to
the
indefinite
subjective
emerson
lack
of
interest
in
permanence
may
cause
him
to
present
a
subjectivity
harsher
on
the
outside
than
is
essential
his
very
universalism
occasionally
seems
a
limitation
somewhere
here
may
lie
a
weakness
real
to
some
apparent
to
others
a
weakness
in
so
far
as
his
relation
becomes
less
vivid
to
the
many
insofar
as
he
the
personal
unit
in
the
universal
if
genius
is
the
most
indebted
how
much
does
it
owe
to
those
who
would
but
do
not
easily
ride
with
it
if
there
is
a
weakness
here
is
it
the
fault
of
substance
or
only
of
manner
if
of
the
former
there
is
organic
error
somewhere
and
emerson
will
become
less
and
less
valuable
to
man
but
this
seems
impossible
at
least
to
us
without
considering
his
manner
or
expression
here
it
forms
the
general
subject
of
the
second
section
of
this
paper
let
us
ask
if
emerson
substance
needs
an
affinity
a
supplement
or
even
a
complement
or
a
gangplank
and
if
so
of
what
will
it
be
composed
perhaps
emerson
could
not
have
risen
to
his
own
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
unitarian
training
and
association
with
the
churchmen
emancipators
christianity
is
founded
on
and
supposes
the
authority
of
reason
and
can
not
therefore
oppose
it
without
subverting
itself
its
office
is
to
discern
universal
truths
great
and
eternal
principles
the
highest
power
of
the
soul
thus
preached
channing
who
knows
but
this
pulpit
aroused
the
younger
emerson
to
the
possibilities
of
intuitive
reasoning
in
spiritual
realms
the
influence
of
men
like
channing
in
his
fight
for
the
dignity
of
human
nature
against
the
arbitrary
revelations
that
calvinism
had
strapped
on
the
church
and
for
the
belief
in
the
divine
in
human
reason
doubtless
encouraged
emerson
in
his
unshackled
search
for
the
infinite
and
gave
him
premises
which
he
later
took
for
granted
instead
of
carrying
them
around
with
him
an
not
an
in
christian
ideal
aims
may
have
caused
him
to
feel
that
the
definite
paths
were
well
established
and
doing
their
share
and
that
for
some
to
reach
the
same
infinite
ends
more
paths
might
be
opened
paths
which
would
in
themselves
and
in
a
more
transcendent
way
partake
of
the
spiritual
nature
of
the
land
in
quest
another
expression
of
god
kingdom
in
man
would
you
have
the
indefinite
paths
always
supplemented
by
the
shadow
of
the
definite
one
of
a
first
influence
a
characteristic
of
rebellion
is
that
its
results
are
often
deepest
when
the
rebel
breaks
not
from
the
worst
to
the
greatest
but
from
the
great
to
the
greater
the
youth
of
the
rebel
increases
this
characteristic
the
innate
rebellious
spirit
in
young
men
is
active
and
buoyant
they
could
rebel
against
and
improve
the
millennium
this
excess
of
enthusiasm
at
the
inception
of
a
movement
causes
loss
of
perspective
a
natural
tendency
to
undervalue
the
great
in
that
which
is
being
taken
as
a
base
of
departure
a
youthful
sedition
of
emerson
was
his
withdrawal
from
the
communion
perhaps
the
most
socialistic
doctrine
or
rather
symbol
of
the
church
a
commune
above
property
or
class
picking
up
an
essay
on
religion
of
a
rather
boy
perhaps
with
a
touch
of
genius
written
when
he
was
still
in
college
and
so
serving
as
a
good
illustration
in
point
we
read
every
thinking
man
knows
that
the
church
is
dead
but
every
thinking
man
knows
that
the
of
the
church
always
has
been
dead
that
part
seen
by
not
enthusiasm
is
restless
and
has
time
to
see
that
if
the
church
holds
itself
as
nothing
but
the
symbol
of
the
greater
light
it
is
life
itself
as
a
symbol
of
a
symbol
it
is
dead
many
of
the
sincerest
followers
of
christ
never
heard
of
him
it
is
the
better
influence
of
an
institution
that
arouses
in
the
deep
and
earnest
souls
a
feeling
of
rebellion
to
make
its
aims
more
certain
it
is
their
very
sincerity
that
causes
these
seekers
for
a
freer
vision
to
strike
down
for
more
fundamental
universal
and
perfect
truths
but
with
such
feverish
enthusiasm
that
they
appear
to
overthink
themselves
a
subconscious
way
of
going
godward
perhaps
the
rebel
of
the
twentieth
century
says
let
us
discard
god
immortality
miracle
but
be
not
untrue
to
ourselves
here
he
no
doubt
in
a
sincere
and
exalted
moment
confuses
god
with
a
name
he
apparently
feels
that
there
is
a
separable
difference
between
natural
and
revealed
religion
he
mistakes
the
powers
behind
them
to
be
fundamentally
separate
in
the
excessive
keenness
of
his
search
he
forgets
that
being
true
to
ourselves
is
god
that
the
faintest
thought
of
immortality
is
god
and
that
god
is
miracle
keeps
one
from
letting
a
common
experience
of
a
day
translate
what
is
stirring
the
soul
the
same
inspiring
force
that
arouses
the
young
rebel
brings
later
in
life
a
kind
of
a
realization
that
the
soul
can
not
discard
or
limit
anything
would
you
have
the
youthful
enthusiasm
of
rebellion
which
emerson
carried
beyond
his
youth
always
supplemented
by
the
shadow
of
experience
perhaps
it
is
not
the
narrow
minded
alone
that
have
no
interest
in
anything
but
in
its
relation
to
their
personality
is
the
christian
religion
to
which
emerson
owes
anything
but
the
revelation
of
god
in
a
personality
a
revelation
so
that
the
narrow
mind
could
become
opened
but
the
tendency
to
personality
may
also
have
suggested
to
emerson
the
necessity
for
more
universal
and
impersonal
paths
though
they
be
indefinite
of
outline
and
vague
of
ascent
could
you
journey
with
equal
benefit
if
they
were
less
so
would
you
have
the
universal
always
supplemented
by
the
shadow
of
the
personal
if
this
view
is
accepted
and
we
doubt
that
it
can
be
by
the
majority
emerson
substance
could
well
bear
a
supplement
perhaps
an
affinity
something
that
will
support
that
which
some
conceive
he
does
not
offer
something
that
will
help
answer
alton
locke
question
what
has
emerson
for
the
and
questions
of
others
who
look
for
the
before
the
ship
comes
in
sight
something
that
will
supply
the
definite
banister
to
the
infinite
which
it
is
said
he
keeps
invisible
something
that
will
point
a
crossroad
from
his
personal
to
his
nature
something
that
may
be
in
thoreau
or
wordsworth
or
in
another
poet
whose
songs
breathe
of
a
new
morning
of
a
higher
life
though
a
definite
beauty
in
nature
or
something
that
will
show
the
birth
of
his
ideal
and
hold
out
a
background
of
revealed
religion
as
a
perspective
to
his
transcendent
religion
a
counterpoise
in
his
rebellion
which
we
feel
channing
or
bushnell
or
other
saints
known
and
unknown
might
supply
if
the
arc
must
be
completed
if
there
are
those
who
would
have
the
great
dim
outlines
of
emerson
fulfilled
it
is
fortunate
that
there
are
bushnells
and
wordsworths
to
whom
they
may
appeal
to
say
nothing
of
the
vedas
the
bible
or
their
own
souls
but
such
possibilities
and
conceptions
the
deeper
they
are
received
the
more
they
seem
to
reduce
their
need
emerson
circle
may
be
a
better
whole
without
its
complement
perhaps
his
unsatiable
demand
for
unity
the
need
to
recognize
one
nature
in
all
variety
of
objects
would
have
been
impaired
if
something
should
make
it
simpler
for
men
to
find
the
identity
they
at
first
want
in
his
substance
draw
if
thou
canst
the
mystic
line
severing
rightly
his
from
thine
which
is
human
which
divine
whatever
means
one
would
use
to
personalize
emerson
natural
revelation
whether
by
a
vision
or
a
board
walk
the
vastness
of
his
aims
and
the
dignity
of
his
tolerance
would
doubtless
cause
him
to
accept
or
at
least
try
to
accept
and
use
magically
as
a
part
of
his
fortune
he
would
modestly
say
perhaps
that
the
world
is
enlarged
for
him
not
by
finding
new
objects
but
by
more
affinities
and
potencies
than
those
he
already
has
but
indeed
is
not
enough
manifestation
already
there
is
not
the
asking
that
it
be
made
more
manifest
forgetting
that
we
are
not
strong
by
our
power
to
penetrate
but
by
our
relatedness
will
more
signs
create
a
greater
sympathy
is
not
our
weak
suggestion
needed
only
for
those
content
with
their
own
hopelessness
others
may
lead
others
to
him
but
he
finds
his
problem
in
making
gladness
hope
and
fortitude
flow
from
his
page
rather
than
in
arranging
that
our
hearts
be
there
to
receive
it
the
first
is
his
duty
the
last
ours
a
devotion
to
an
end
tends
to
undervalue
the
means
a
power
of
revelation
may
make
one
more
concerned
about
his
perceptions
of
the
soul
nature
than
the
way
of
their
disclosure
emerson
is
more
interested
in
what
he
perceives
than
in
his
expression
of
it
he
is
a
creator
whose
intensity
is
consumed
more
with
the
substance
of
his
creation
than
with
the
manner
by
which
he
shows
it
to
others
like
petrarch
he
seems
more
a
discoverer
of
beauty
than
an
imparter
of
it
but
these
discoveries
these
devotions
to
aims
these
struggles
toward
the
absolute
do
not
these
in
themselves
impart
something
if
not
all
of
their
own
unity
and
coherence
which
is
not
received
as
such
at
first
nor
is
foremost
in
their
expression
it
must
be
remembered
that
truth
was
what
emerson
was
after
not
strength
of
outline
or
even
beauty
except
in
so
far
as
they
might
reveal
themselves
naturally
in
his
explorations
towards
the
infinite
to
think
hard
and
deeply
and
to
say
what
is
thought
regardless
of
consequences
may
produce
a
first
impression
either
of
great
translucence
or
of
great
muddiness
but
in
the
latter
there
may
be
hidden
possibilities
some
accuse
orchestration
of
being
muddy
this
may
be
a
good
name
for
a
first
impression
of
it
but
if
it
should
seem
less
so
he
might
not
be
saying
what
he
thought
the
mud
may
be
a
form
of
sincerity
which
demands
that
the
heart
be
translated
rather
than
handed
around
through
the
pit
a
clearer
scoring
might
have
lowered
the
thought
carlyle
told
emerson
that
some
of
his
paragraphs
did
cohere
emerson
wrote
by
sentences
or
phrases
rather
than
by
logical
sequence
his
underlying
plan
of
work
seems
based
on
the
large
unity
of
a
series
of
particular
aspects
of
a
subject
rather
than
on
the
continuity
of
its
expression
as
thoughts
surge
to
his
mind
he
fills
the
heavens
with
them
crowds
them
in
if
necessary
but
seldom
arranges
them
along
the
ground
first
among
excuses
for
emerson
imperfect
coherence
and
lack
of
unity
is
one
that
remembers
that
his
essays
were
made
from
lecture
notes
his
habit
often
in
lecturing
was
to
compile
his
ideas
as
they
came
to
him
on
a
general
subject
in
scattered
notes
and
when
on
the
platform
to
trust
to
the
mood
of
the
occasion
to
assemble
them
this
seems
a
specious
explanation
though
true
to
fact
vagueness
is
at
times
an
indication
of
nearness
to
a
perfect
truth
the
definite
glory
of
bernard
of
cluny
celestial
city
is
more
beautiful
than
true
probably
orderly
reason
does
not
always
have
to
be
a
visible
part
of
all
great
things
logic
may
possibly
require
that
unity
means
something
ascending
in
relation
to
the
parts
and
to
the
whole
with
no
ellipsis
in
the
ascent
but
reason
may
permit
even
demand
an
ellipsis
and
genius
may
not
need
the
part
in
fact
these
parts
may
be
the
in
the
progress
of
unity
they
may
be
filled
with
little
but
repetition
nature
loves
analogy
and
hates
repetition
botany
reveals
evolution
not
permanence
an
apparent
confusion
if
lived
with
long
enough
may
become
orderly
emerson
was
not
writing
for
lazy
minds
though
one
of
the
keenest
of
his
academic
friends
said
that
he
emerson
could
not
explain
many
of
his
own
pages
but
why
should
he
he
explained
them
when
he
discovered
them
the
moment
before
he
spoke
or
wrote
them
a
rare
experience
of
a
moment
at
daybreak
when
something
in
nature
seems
to
reveal
all
consciousness
can
not
be
explained
at
noon
yet
it
is
a
part
of
the
day
unity
at
evening
nature
is
absorbed
by
another
experience
she
dislikes
to
explain
as
much
as
to
repeat
it
is
conceivable
that
what
is
unified
form
to
the
author
or
composer
may
of
necessity
be
formless
to
his
audience
a
will
cause
more
unity
in
the
grand
stand
than
in
the
season
batting
average
if
a
composer
once
starts
to
compromise
his
work
will
begin
to
drag
on
him
before
the
end
is
reached
his
inspiration
has
all
gone
up
in
sounds
pleasing
to
his
audience
ugly
to
him
sacrificed
for
the
first
acoustic
an
opaque
clarity
a
picture
painted
for
its
hanging
easy
unity
like
easy
virtue
is
easier
to
describe
when
judged
from
its
lapses
than
from
its
constancy
when
the
infidel
admits
god
is
great
he
means
only
i
am
lazy
it
is
easier
to
talk
than
live
ruskin
also
says
suppose
i
like

best
who
shall
say
i
right

no

it
is
simply
a
question
of
experience
you
may
not
be
able
to
experience
a
symphony
even
after
twenty
performances
initial
coherence
today
may
be
dullness
tomorrow
probably
because
formal
or
outward
unity
depends
so
much
on
repetition
sequences
antitheses
paragraphs
with
inductions
and
summaries
macaulay
had
that
kind
of
unity
can
you
read
him
today
emerson
rather
goes
out
and
shouts
thinking
of
the
sun
glory
today
and
i
let
his
light
shine
through
me
i
say
any
damn
thing
that
this
inspires
me
with
perhaps
there
are
flashes
of
light
still
in
cipher
kept
there
by
unity
the
code
of
which
the
world
has
not
yet
discovered
the
unity
of
one
sentence
inspires
the
unity
of
the
whole
though
its
physique
is
as
ragged
as
the
dolomites
intense
lights
vague
shadows
great
pillars
in
a
horizon
are
difficult
things
to
nail
signboards
to
emerson
qualities
make
him
hard
to
classify
but
easy
for
some
there
are
many
who
like
to
say
that
he
even
all
the
concord
men
are
intellectuals
perhaps
but
intellectuals
who
wear
their
brains
nearer
the
heart
than
some
of
their
critics
it
is
as
dangerous
to
determine
a
characteristic
by
manner
as
by
mood
emerson
is
a
pure
intellectual
to
those
who
prefer
to
take
him
as
literally
as
they
can
there
are
reformers
and
in
the
form
lies
their
interest
who
prefer
to
stand
on
the
plain
and
then
insist
they
see
from
the
summit
indolent
legs
supply
the
strength
of
eye
for
their
inspiration
the
intellect
is
never
a
whole
it
is
where
the
soul
finds
things
it
is
often
the
only
track
to
the
it
appears
a
whole
but
never
becomes
one
even
in
the
stock
exchange
or
the
convent
or
the
laboratory
in
the
cleverest
criminal
it
is
but
a
way
to
a
low
ideal
it
can
never
discard
the
other
part
of
its
duality
the
soul
or
the
void
where
the
soul
ought
to
be
so
why
classify
a
quality
always
so
relative
that
it
is
more
an
agency
than
substance
a
quality
that
disappears
when
classified
the
life
of
the
all
must
stream
through
us
to
make
the
man
and
the
moment
great
a
sailor
with
a
precious
cargo
does
analyze
the
water
because
emerson
had
generations
of
calvinistic
sermons
in
his
blood
some
cataloguers
would
localize
or
provincialize
him
with
the
sternness
of
the
old
puritan
mind
they
make
him
that
hold
him
there
they
lean
heavily
on
what
they
find
of
the
above
influence
in
him
they
wo
follow
the
rivers
in
his
thought
and
the
play
of
his
soul
and
their
cousin
cataloguers
put
him
in
another
they
label
him
ascetic
they
translate
his
outward
serenity
into
an
impression
of
severity
but
truth
keeps
one
from
being
hysterical
is
a
demagogue
a
friend
of
the
people
because
he
will
lie
to
them
to
make
them
cry
and
raise
false
hopes
a
search
for
perfect
truths
throws
out
a
beauty
more
spiritual
than
sensuous
a
sombre
dignity
of
style
is
often
confused
by
and
by
with
austerity
if
emerson
manner
is
not
always
beautiful
in
accordance
with
accepted
standards
why
not
accept
a
few
other
standards
he
is
an
ascetic
in
that
he
refuses
to
compromise
content
with
manner
but
a
real
ascetic
is
an
extremist
who
has
but
one
height
thus
may
come
the
confusion
of
one
who
says
that
emerson
carries
him
high
but
then
leaves
him
always
at
that
height
no
higher
a
confusion
mistaking
a
latent
exultation
for
an
ascetic
reserve
the
rules
of
thorough
bass
can
be
applied
to
his
scale
of
flight
no
more
than
they
can
to
the
planetary
system
jadassohn
if
emerson
were
literally
a
composer
could
no
more
analyze
his
harmony
than
a
could
a
microscope
might
show
that
he
uses
chords
of
the
or
the
but
a
lens
far
different
tells
us
they
are
used
with
different
aims
from
those
of
debussy
emerson
is
definite
in
that
his
art
is
based
on
something
stronger
than
the
amusing
or
at
its
best
the
beguiling
of
a
few
mortals
if
he
uses
a
sensuous
chord
it
is
not
for
sensual
ears
his
harmonies
may
float
if
the
wind
blows
in
that
direction
through
a
voluptuous
atmosphere
but
he
has
not
debussy
fondness
for
trying
to
blow
a
sensuous
atmosphere
from
his
own
voluptuous
cheeks
and
so
he
is
an
ascetic
there
is
a
distance
between
jowl
and
soul
and
it
is
not
measured
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
between
concord
and
paris
on
the
other
hand
if
one
thinks
that
his
harmony
contains
no
dramatic
chords
because
no
theatrical
sound
is
heard
let
him
listen
to
the
finale
of
success
or
of
spiritual
laws
or
to
some
of
the
poems
brahma
or
sursum
corda
for
example
of
a
truth
his
codas
often
seem
to
crystallize
in
a
dramatic
though
serene
and
sustained
way
the
truths
of
his
subject
they
become
more
active
and
intense
but
quieter
and
deeper
then
there
comes
along
another
set
of
cataloguers
they
put
him
down
as
a
classicist
or
a
romanticist
or
an
eclectic
because
a
prophet
is
a
child
of
romanticism
because
revelation
is
classic
because
eclecticism
quotes
from
eclectic
hindu
philosophy
a
more
sympathetic
cataloguer
may
say
that
emerson
inspires
courage
of
the
quieter
kind
and
delight
of
the
higher
kind
the
same
school
teacher
who
told
the
boys
that
thoreau
was
a
naturalist
because
he
did
like
to
work
puts
down
emerson
as
a
classic
and
hawthorne
as
a
romantic
a
loud
voice
made
this
doubly
true
and
sure
to
be
on
the
examination
paper
but
this
teacher
of
truth
and
dogma
apparently
forgot
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
classicism
or
romanticism
one
has
but
to
go
to
the
various
definitions
of
these
to
know
that
if
you
go
to
a
classic
definition
you
know
what
a
true
classic
is
and
similarly
a
true
romantic
but
if
you
go
to
both
you
have
an
algebraic
formula
x
x
a
cancellation
an
apercu
and
hence
satisfying
if
you
go
to
all
definitions
you
have
another
formula
x
x
a
destruction
another
apercu
and
hence
satisfying
professor
beers
goes
to
the
dictionary
you
would
think
a
college
professor
would
be
as
reckless
as
that
and
so
he
can
say
that
romantic
is
pertaining
to
the
style
of
the
christian
and
popular
literature
of
the
middle
ages
a
roman
catholic
mode
of
salvation
not
this
definition
but
having
a
definition
and
so
can
say
that
walter
scott
is
a
romanticist
and
billy
phelps
a
classic
sometimes
but
for
our
part
dick
croker
is
a
classic
and
job
a
romanticist
another
professor
babbitt
by
name
links
up
romanticism
with
rousseau
and
charges
against
it
many
of
man
troubles
he
somehow
likes
to
mix
it
up
with
sin
he
throws
saucers
at
it
but
in
a
scholarly
interesting
sincere
and
accurate
way
he
uncovers
a
deformed
foot
gives
it
a
name
from
which
we
are
allowed
to
infer
that
the
covered
foot
is
healthy
and
named
classicism
but
no
christian
scientist
can
prove
that
christ
never
had
a
the
architecture
of
humanism
footnote
geoffrey
scott
constable
tells
us
that
romanticism
consists
of
a
poetic
sensibility
towards
the
remote
as
such
but
is
plato
a
classic
or
towards
the
remote
is
classicism
a
poor
relation
of
time
not
of
man
is
a
thing
classic
or
romantic
because
it
is
or
is
not
passed
by
that
biologic
that
indescribable
going
on
in
all
life
let
us
settle
the
point
for
good
and
say
that
a
thing
is
classic
if
it
is
thought
of
in
terms
of
the
past
and
romantic
if
thought
of
in
terms
of
the
future
and
a
thing
thought
of
in
terms
of
the
present
is
well
that
is
impossible
hence
we
allow
ourselves
to
say
that
emerson
is
neither
a
classic
or
romantic
but
both
and
both
not
only
at
different
times
in
one
essay
but
at
the
same
time
in
one
sentence
in
one
word
and
must
we
admit
it
so
is
everyone
if
you
do
believe
it
there
must
be
some
true
definition
you
have
seen
chopin
shows
a
few
things
that
bach
forgot
but
he
is
not
eclectic
they
say
brahms
shows
many
things
that
bach
did
remember
so
he
is
an
eclectic
they
say
leoncavallo
writes
pretty
verses
and
palestrina
is
a
priest
and
confucius
inspires
scriabin
a
choice
is
freedom
natural
selection
is
but
one
of
nature
tunes
all
melodious
poets
shall
be
hoarse
as
street
ballads
when
once
the
penetrating
keynote
of
nature
and
spirit
is
sounded
the
which
make
the
tune
to
which
the
sun
rolls
and
the
globule
of
blood
and
the
sap
of
the
trees
an
intuitive
sense
of
values
tends
to
make
emerson
use
social
political
and
even
economic
phenomena
as
means
of
expression
as
the
accidental
notes
in
his
scale
rather
than
as
ends
even
lesser
ends
in
the
realization
that
they
are
essential
parts
of
the
greater
values
he
does
not
confuse
them
with
each
other
he
remains
undisturbed
except
in
rare
instances
when
the
lower
parts
invade
and
seek
to
displace
the
higher
he
was
not
afraid
to
say
that
there
are
laws
which
should
not
be
too
well
obeyed
to
him
slavery
was
not
a
social
or
a
political
or
an
economic
question
nor
even
one
of
morals
or
of
ethics
but
one
of
universal
spiritual
freedom
only
it
mattered
little
what
party
or
what
platform
or
what
law
of
commerce
governed
men
was
man
governing
himself
social
error
and
virtue
were
but
relative
this
habit
of
not
being
hindered
by
using
but
still
going
beyond
the
great
truths
of
living
to
the
greater
truths
of
life
gave
force
to
his
influence
over
the
materialists
thus
he
seems
to
us
more
a
regenerator
than
a
reformer
more
an
interpreter
of
life
reflexes
than
of
life
facts
perhaps
here
he
appears
greater
than
voltaire
or
rousseau
and
helped
perhaps
by
the
centrality
of
his
conceptions
he
could
arouse
the
deeper
spiritual
and
moral
emotions
without
causing
his
listeners
to
distort
their
physical
ones
to
prove
that
mind
is
over
matter
he
does
place
matter
over
mind
he
is
not
like
the
man
who
because
he
could
afford
both
gave
up
metaphysics
for
an
automobile
and
when
he
ran
over
a
man
blamed
metaphysics
he
would
not
have
us
get
about
physical
disturbance
but
have
it
accepted
as
a
part
of
any
progress
in
culture
moral
spiritual
or
aesthetic
if
a
poet
retires
to
the
to
avoid
the
vulgar
unculture
of
men
and
their
physical
disturbance
so
that
he
may
better
catch
a
nobler
theme
for
his
symphony
emerson
tells
him
that
man
culture
can
spare
nothing
wants
all
material
converts
all
impediments
into
instruments
all
enemies
into
power
the
latest
product
of
man
culture
the
aeroplane
then
sails
the
mountain
and
instead
of
an
inspiration
a
spray
of
falls
on
the
poet
calm
yourself
poet
says
emerson
culture
will
convert
furies
into
muses
and
hells
into
benefit
this
would
have
befallen
you
if
it
been
for
the
latest
transcendent
product
of
the
genius
of
culture
we
wo
say
what
kind
a
consummation
of
the
dreams
of
poets
from
david
to
tennyson
material
progress
is
but
a
means
of
expression
realize
that
man
coarseness
has
its
future
and
will
also
be
refined
in
the
gradual
uprise
turning
the
world
upside
down
may
be
one
of
its
lesser
incidents
it
is
the
cause
seldom
the
effect
that
interests
emerson
he
can
help
the
cause
the
effect
must
help
itself
he
might
have
said
to
those
who
talk
knowingly
about
the
cause
of
war
or
of
the
last
war
and
who
would
trace
it
down
through
long
vistas
of
cosmic
political
moral
evolution
and
what
not
he
might
say
that
the
cause
of
it
was
as
simple
as
that
of
any
dogfight
the
of
the
minority
against
the
universal
mind
the
majority
the
of
the
former
fears
to
believe
in
the
innate
goodness
of
mankind
the
cause
is
always
the
same
the
effect
different
by
chance
it
is
as
easy
for
a
hog
even
a
stupid
one
to
step
on
a
box
of
matches
under
a
tenement
with
a
thousand
souls
as
under
an
empty
the
many
kindly
burn
up
for
the
few
for
the
minority
is
selfish
and
the
majority
generous
the
minority
has
ruled
the
world
for
physical
reasons
the
physical
reasons
are
being
removed
by
this
converting
culture
webster
will
not
much
longer
have
to
grope
for
the
mind
of
his
constituency
the
majority
the
people
will
need
no
intermediary
governments
will
pass
from
the
representative
to
the
direct
the
is
the
principal
thing
that
is
making
this
transition
slow
the
biggest
prop
to
the
is
pride
pride
in
property
and
the
power
property
gives
ruskin
backs
this
up
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
great
mistakes
other
passions
do
occasional
good
but
whenever
pride
puts
in
its
word
it
is
all
over
with
the
artist
the
and
its
handmaidens
in
disorder
superficial
brightness
fundamental
dullness
then
cowardice
and
suspicion
all
a
part
of
the
minority
the
the
antithesis
of
everything
called
soul
spirit
christianity
truth
freedom
will
give
way
more
and
more
to
the
great
primal
truths
that
there
is
more
good
than
evil
that
god
is
on
the
side
of
the
majority
the
people
that
he
is
not
enthusiastic
about
the
minority
the
that
he
has
made
men
greater
than
man
that
he
has
made
the
universal
mind
and
the
greater
and
a
part
of
the
individual
mind
and
soul
that
he
has
made
the
divine
a
part
of
all
again
if
a
picture
in
economics
is
before
him
emerson
plunges
down
to
the
things
that
are
because
they
are
better
than
they
are
if
there
is
a
row
which
there
usually
is
between
the
ebb
and
flood
tide
in
the
material
ocean
for
example
between
the
theory
of
the
present
order
of
competition
and
of
attractive
and
associated
labor
he
would
sympathize
with
ricardo
perhaps
that
labor
is
the
measure
of
value
but
embrace
as
do
generous
minds
the
proposition
of
labor
shared
by
all
he
would
go
deeper
than
political
economics
strain
out
the
from
both
theories
and
make
the
measure
of
each
pretty
much
the
same
so
that
the
natural
the
majority
would
win
but
not
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
minority
the
artificial
because
this
has
disappeared
it
is
of
the
majority
john
stuart
mill
political
economy
is
losing
value
because
it
was
written
by
a
mind
more
a
banker
than
a
poet
the
poet
knows
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
perpetual
law
of
supply
and
demand
perhaps
not
of
demand
and
supply
or
of
the
or
or
increments
earned
or
unearned
and
that
the
existence
of
personal
or
public
property
may
not
prove
the
existence
of
god
emerson
seems
to
use
the
great
definite
interests
of
humanity
to
express
the
greater
indefinite
spiritual
values
to
fulfill
what
he
can
in
his
realms
of
revelation
thus
it
seems
that
so
close
a
relation
exists
between
his
content
and
expression
his
substance
and
manner
that
if
he
were
more
definite
in
the
latter
he
would
lose
power
in
the
former
perhaps
some
of
those
occasional
flashes
would
have
been
unexpressed
flashes
that
have
gone
down
through
the
world
and
will
flame
on
through
the
ages
flashes
that
approach
as
near
the
divine
as
beethoven
in
his
most
inspired
moments
flashes
of
transcendent
beauty
of
such
universal
import
that
they
may
bring
of
a
sudden
some
intimate
personal
experience
and
produce
the
same
indescribable
effect
that
comes
in
rare
instances
to
men
from
some
common
sensation
in
the
early
morning
of
a
memorial
day
a
boy
is
awakened
by
martial
music
a
village
band
is
marching
down
the
street
and
as
the
strains
of
reeves
majestic
seventh
regiment
march
come
nearer
and
nearer
he
seems
of
a
sudden
translated
a
moment
of
vivid
power
comes
a
consciousness
of
material
nobility
an
exultant
something
gleaming
with
the
possibilities
of
this
life
an
assurance
that
nothing
is
impossible
and
that
the
whole
world
lies
at
his
feet
but
as
the
band
turns
the
corner
at
the
soldiers
monument
and
the
march
steps
of
the
grand
army
become
fainter
and
fainter
the
vision
slowly
vanishes
his
world
becomes
less
and
less
probable
but
the
experience
ever
lies
within
him
in
its
reality
later
in
life
the
same
boy
hears
the
sabbath
morning
bell
ringing
out
from
the
white
steeple
at
the
center
and
as
it
draws
him
to
it
through
the
autumn
fields
of
sumac
and
asters
a
gospel
hymn
of
simple
devotion
comes
out
to
him
there
a
wideness
in
god
mercy
an
instant
suggestion
of
that
memorial
day
morning
comes
but
the
moment
is
of
deeper
import
there
is
no
personal
exultation
no
intimate
world
vision
no
magnified
personal
hope
and
in
their
place
a
profound
sense
of
a
spiritual
truth
a
sin
within
reach
of
forgiveness
and
as
the
hymn
voices
die
away
there
lies
at
his
feet
not
the
world
but
the
figure
of
the
saviour
he
sees
an
unfathomable
courage
an
immortality
for
the
lowest
the
vastness
in
humility
the
kindness
of
the
human
heart
man
noblest
strength
and
he
knows
that
god
is
nothing
nothing
but
love
whence
cometh
the
wonder
of
a
moment
from
sources
we
know
not
but
we
do
know
that
from
obscurity
and
from
this
higher
orpheus
come
measures
of
sphere
melodies
note
paraphrased
from
a
passage
in
sartor
resartus
flowing
in
wild
native
tones
ravaging
the
souls
of
men
flowing
now
with
accompaniments
and
rich
symphonies
through
all
our
hearts
modulating
and
divinely
leading
them
what
is
character
in
how
far
does
it
sustain
the
soul
or
the
soul
it
is
it
a
part
of
the
soul
and
then
what
is
the
soul
plato
knows
but
can
not
tell
us
every
man
knows
but
no
one
tells
us
nature
will
not
be
disposed
of
easily
no
power
of
genius
has
ever
yet
had
the
smallest
success
in
explaining
existence
the
perfect
enigma
remains
as
every
blind
man
sees
the
sun
so
character
may
be
the
part
of
the
soul
we
the
blind
can
see
and
then
have
the
right
to
imagine
that
the
soul
is
each
man
share
of
god
and
character
the
muscle
which
tries
to
reveal
its
mysteries
a
kind
of
its
first
visible
radiance
the
right
to
know
that
it
is
the
voice
which
is
always
calling
the
pragmatist
a
fool
at
any
rate
it
can
be
said
that
emerson
character
has
much
to
do
with
his
power
upon
us
men
who
have
known
nothing
of
his
life
have
borne
witness
to
this
it
is
directly
at
the
root
of
his
substance
and
affects
his
manner
only
indirectly
it
gives
the
sincerity
to
the
constant
spiritual
hopefulness
we
are
always
conscious
of
and
which
carries
with
it
often
even
when
the
expression
is
somber
a
note
of
exultation
in
the
victories
of
the
innate
virtues
of
man
and
it
is
this
perhaps
that
makes
us
feel
his
courage
not
a
but
a
sympathetic
one
courageous
even
to
tenderness
it
is
the
open
courage
of
a
kind
heart
of
not
forcing
opinions
a
thing
much
needed
when
the
cowardly
underhanded
courage
of
the
fanatic
would
force
opinion
it
is
the
courage
of
believing
in
freedom
per
se
rather
than
of
trying
to
force
everyone
to
see
that
you
believe
in
it
the
courage
of
the
willingness
to
be
reformed
rather
than
of
reforming
the
courage
teaching
that
sacrifice
is
bravery
and
force
fear
the
courage
of
righteous
indignation
of
stammering
eloquence
of
spiritual
insight
a
courage
ever
contracting
or
unfolding
a
philosophy
as
it
grows
a
courage
that
would
make
the
impossible
possible
oliver
wendell
holmes
says
that
emerson
attempted
the
impossible
in
the
an
overflow
of
spiritual
imagination
but
he
emerson
accomplished
the
impossible
in
attempting
it
and
still
leaving
it
impossible
a
courageous
struggle
to
satisfy
as
thoreau
says
hunger
rather
than
the
palate
the
hunger
of
a
lifetime
sometimes
by
one
meal
his
essay
on
the
which
he
did
not
write
treats
of
that
part
of
the
influence
on
unborn
ages
and
attempts
the
impossible
only
when
it
stops
attempting
it
like
all
courageous
souls
the
higher
emerson
soars
the
more
lowly
he
becomes
do
you
think
the
porter
and
the
cook
have
no
experiences
no
wonders
for
you
everyone
knows
as
much
as
the
savant
to
some
the
way
to
be
humble
is
to
admonish
the
humble
not
learn
from
them
carlyle
would
have
emerson
teach
by
more
definite
signs
rather
than
interpret
his
revelations
or
shall
we
say
preach
admitting
all
the
inspiration
and
help
that
sartor
resartus
has
given
in
spite
of
its
vaudeville
and
tragic
stages
to
many
young
men
getting
under
way
in
the
life
of
tailor
or
king
we
believe
it
can
be
said
but
very
broadly
said
that
emerson
either
in
the
first
or
second
series
of
essays
taken
as
a
whole
gives
it
seems
to
us
greater
inspiration
partly
because
his
manner
is
less
didactic
less
personally
suggestive
perhaps
less
clearly
or
obviously
human
than
carlyle
how
direct
this
inspiration
is
is
a
matter
of
personal
viewpoint
temperament
perhaps
inheritance
augustine
birrell
says
he
does
not
feel
it
and
he
seems
not
to
even
indirectly
apparently
a
author
inspire
him
for
emerson
seems
to
him
a
little
thin
and
vague
is
emerson
or
the
english
climate
to
blame
for
this
he
birrell
says
a
really
great
author
dissipates
all
fears
as
to
his
staying
power
though
fears
for
our
not
emerson
is
what
we
would
like
dissipated
besides
around
a
really
great
author
there
are
no
fears
to
dissipate
a
wise
author
never
allows
his
reader
mind
to
be
at
large
but
emerson
is
not
a
wise
author
his
essay
on
prudence
has
nothing
to
do
with
prudence
for
to
be
wise
and
prudent
he
must
put
explanation
first
and
let
his
substance
dissolve
because
of
it
how
carefully
says
birrell
again
a
really
great
author
like
newman
or
renan
explains
to
you
what
he
is
going
to
do
and
how
he
is
going
to
do
it
personally
we
like
the
chance
of
having
a
hand
in
the
explaining
we
prefer
to
look
at
flowers
but
not
through
a
botany
for
it
seems
that
if
we
look
at
them
alone
we
see
a
beauty
of
poetry
a
direct
gift
from
the
divine
and
if
we
look
at
botany
alone
we
see
the
beauty
of
nature
intellect
a
direct
gift
of
the
divine
if
we
look
at
both
together
we
see
nothing
thus
it
seems
that
carlyle
and
birrell
would
have
it
that
courage
and
humility
have
something
to
do
with
explanation
and
that
it
is
not
a
respect
for
all
a
faith
in
the
power
of
innate
virtue
to
perceive
by
relativeness
rather
than
penetration
that
causes
emerson
to
withhold
explanation
to
a
greater
degree
than
many
writers
carlyle
asks
for
more
utility
and
birrell
for
more
inspiration
but
we
like
to
believe
that
it
is
the
height
of
emerson
character
evidenced
especially
in
his
courage
and
humility
that
shades
its
quality
rather
than
that
its
virtue
is
less
that
it
is
his
height
that
will
make
him
more
and
more
valuable
and
more
and
more
within
the
reach
of
all
whether
it
be
by
utility
inspiration
or
other
needs
of
the
human
soul
can
not
some
of
the
most
valuable
kinds
of
utility
and
inspiration
come
from
humility
in
its
highest
and
purest
forms
for
is
not
the
truest
kind
of
humility
a
kind
of
glorified
or
transcendent
democracy
the
practicing
it
rather
than
the
talking
it
the
to
level
all
finite
things
but
the
being
willing
to
be
leveled
towards
the
infinite
until
humility
produces
that
frame
of
mind
and
spirit
in
the
artist
can
his
audience
gain
the
greatest
kind
of
utility
and
inspiration
which
might
be
quite
invisible
at
first
emerson
realizes
the
value
of
the
many
that
the
law
of
averages
has
a
divine
source
he
recognizes
the
various
in
reality
not
by
reason
of
their
closeness
or
remoteness
but
because
he
sympathizes
with
men
who
live
them
and
the
majority
do
the
private
store
of
reason
is
not
great
would
that
there
were
a
public
store
for
man
cries
pascal
but
there
is
says
emerson
it
is
the
universal
mind
an
institution
congenital
with
the
common
or
pascal
is
discouraged
for
he
lets
himself
be
influenced
by
surface
political
and
religious
history
which
shows
the
struggle
of
the
group
led
by
an
individual
rather
than
that
of
the
individual
led
by
himself
a
struggle
as
much
privately
caused
as
privately
led
the
of
all
social
progress
has
been
spiritual
rather
than
intellectual
in
character
but
the
many
bypaths
of
though
never
obliterating
the
highway
have
dimmed
its
outlines
and
caused
travelers
to
confuse
the
colors
along
the
road
a
more
natural
way
of
freeing
the
congestion
in
the
benefits
of
material
progress
will
make
it
less
difficult
for
the
majority
to
recognize
the
true
relation
between
the
important
spiritual
and
religious
values
and
the
less
important
intellectual
and
economic
values
as
the
action
of
the
intellect
and
universal
mind
becomes
more
and
more
identical
the
clearer
will
the
relation
of
all
values
become
but
for
physical
reasons
the
group
has
had
to
depend
upon
the
individual
as
leaders
and
the
leaders
with
few
exceptions
restrained
the
universal
mind
they
trusted
to
the
private
store
but
now
thanks
to
the
lessons
of
evolution
which
nature
has
been
teaching
men
since
and
before
the
days
of
socrates
the
public
store
of
reason
is
gradually
taking
the
place
of
the
leader
from
the
chaldean
tablet
to
the
wireless
message
this
public
store
has
been
wonderfully
opened
the
results
of
these
lessons
the
possibilities
they
are
offering
for
ever
coordinating
the
mind
of
humanity
the
culmination
of
this
are
seen
today
in
many
ways
labor
federation
suffrage
extension
are
two
instances
that
come
to
mind
among
the
many
in
these
manifestations
by
reason
of
tradition
or
the
part
of
tradition
the
of
the
few
the
minority
comes
in
play
the
possessors
of
this
are
called
leaders
but
even
these
are
beginning
to
see
that
the
movement
is
the
leader
and
that
they
are
only
clerks
broadly
speaking
the
effects
evidenced
in
the
political
side
of
history
have
so
much
of
the
physical
because
the
causes
have
been
so
much
of
the
physical
as
a
result
the
leaders
for
the
most
part
have
been
men
with
skins
thick
wits
slick
and
hands
quick
with
otherwise
they
would
not
have
become
leaders
but
the
day
of
leaders
as
such
is
gradually
closing
the
people
are
beginning
to
lead
themselves
the
public
store
of
reason
is
slowly
being
opened
the
common
universal
mind
and
the
common
is
slowly
but
inevitably
coming
into
its
own
let
a
man
believe
in
god
not
in
names
and
places
and
persons
let
the
great
soul
incarnated
in
some
poor
sad
and
simple
joan
go
out
to
service
and
sweep
chimneys
and
scrub
floors
its
effulgent
day
beams
can
not
be
muffled
and
then
to
sweep
and
scrub
will
instantly
appear
supreme
and
beautiful
actions
and
all
people
will
get
brooms
and
mops
perhaps
if
all
of
emerson
his
works
and
his
life
were
to
be
swept
away
and
nothing
of
him
but
the
record
of
the
following
incident
remained
to
men
the
influence
of
his
soul
would
still
be
great
a
working
woman
after
coming
from
one
of
his
lectures
said
i
love
to
go
to
hear
emerson
not
because
i
understand
him
but
because
he
looks
as
though
he
thought
everybody
was
as
good
as
he
was
is
it
not
the
courage
the
spiritual
hopefulness
in
his
humility
that
makes
this
story
possible
and
true
is
it
not
this
trait
in
his
character
that
sets
him
above
all
creeds
that
gives
him
inspired
belief
in
the
common
mind
and
soul
is
it
not
this
courageous
universalism
that
gives
conviction
to
his
prophecy
and
that
makes
his
symphonies
of
revelation
begin
and
end
with
nothing
but
the
strength
and
beauty
of
innate
goodness
in
man
in
nature
and
in
god
the
greatest
and
most
inspiring
theme
of
concord
transcendental
philosophy
as
we
hear
it
and
it
is
from
such
a
theme
and
from
such
vantage
ground
that
emerson
rises
to
almost
perfect
freedom
of
action
of
thought
and
of
soul
in
any
direction
and
to
any
height
a
vantage
ground
somewhat
vaster
than
schelling
conception
of
transcendental
philosophy
a
philosophy
of
nature
become
subjective
in
concord
it
includes
the
objective
and
becomes
subjective
to
nothing
but
freedom
and
the
absolute
law
it
is
this
underlying
courage
of
the
purest
humility
that
gives
emerson
that
outward
aspect
of
serenity
which
is
felt
to
so
great
an
extent
in
much
of
his
work
especially
in
his
codas
and
perorations
and
within
this
poised
strength
we
are
conscious
of
that
original
authentic
fire
which
emerson
missed
in
shelley
we
are
conscious
of
something
that
is
not
dispassionate
something
that
is
at
times
almost
turbulent
a
kind
of
furious
calm
lying
deeply
in
the
conviction
of
the
eventual
triumph
of
the
soul
and
its
union
with
god
let
us
place
the
transcendent
emerson
where
he
himself
places
milton
in
wordsworth
apostrophe
pure
as
the
naked
heavens
majestic
free
so
didst
thou
travel
on
life
common
way
in
cheerful
godliness
the
godliness
of
spiritual
courage
and
hopefulness
these
fathers
of
faith
rise
to
a
glorified
peace
in
the
depth
of
his
greater
perorations
there
is
an
oracle
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
symphony
in
those
four
notes
lies
one
of
beethoven
greatest
messages
we
would
place
its
translation
above
the
relentlessness
of
fate
knocking
at
the
door
above
the
greater
of
destiny
and
strive
to
bring
it
towards
the
spiritual
message
of
revelations
even
to
the
common
heart
of
concord
the
soul
of
humanity
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
divine
mysteries
radiant
in
the
faith
that
it
will
be
opened
and
the
human
become
the
divine
iii
hawthorne
the
substance
of
hawthorne
is
so
dripping
wet
with
the
supernatural
the
phantasmal
the
mystical
so
surcharged
with
adventures
from
the
deeper
picturesque
to
the
illusive
fantastic
one
unconsciously
finds
oneself
thinking
of
him
as
a
poet
of
greater
imaginative
impulse
than
emerson
or
thoreau
he
was
not
a
greater
poet
possibly
than
they
but
a
greater
artist
not
only
the
character
of
his
substance
but
the
care
in
his
manner
throws
his
workmanship
in
contrast
to
theirs
into
a
kind
of
like
poe
he
quite
naturally
and
unconsciously
reaches
out
over
his
subject
to
his
reader
his
mesmerism
seeks
to
mesmerize
us
beyond
zenobia
sister
but
he
is
too
great
an
artist
to
show
his
hand
in
getting
his
audience
as
poe
and
tschaikowsky
occasionally
do
his
intellectual
muscles
are
too
strong
to
let
him
become
as
ravel
and
stravinsky
seem
to
be
by
the
morbidly
fascinating
a
kind
of
false
beauty
obtained
by
artistic
monotony
however
we
can
not
but
feel
that
he
would
weave
his
spell
over
us
as
would
the
grimms
and
aesop
we
feel
as
much
under
magic
as
the
enchanted
frog
this
is
part
of
the
artist
business
the
effect
is
a
part
of
his
in
its
inception
emerson
substance
and
even
his
manner
has
little
to
do
with
a
designed
effect
his
thunderbolts
or
delicate
fragments
are
flashed
out
regardless
they
may
knock
us
down
or
just
spatter
us
it
matters
little
to
him
but
hawthorne
is
more
considerate
that
is
he
is
more
artistic
as
men
say
hawthorne
may
be
more
noticeably
indigenous
or
may
have
more
local
color
perhaps
more
national
color
than
his
concord
contemporaries
but
the
work
of
anyone
who
is
somewhat
more
interested
in
psychology
than
in
transcendental
philosophy
will
weave
itself
around
individuals
and
their
personalities
if
the
same
anyone
happens
to
live
in
salem
his
work
is
likely
to
be
colored
by
the
salem
wharves
and
salem
witches
if
the
same
anyone
happens
to
live
in
the
old
manse
near
the
concord
battle
bridge
he
is
likely
of
a
rainy
day
to
betake
himself
to
the
huge
garret
the
secrets
of
which
he
wonders
at
but
is
too
reverent
of
their
dust
and
cobwebs
to
disturb
he
is
likely
to
bow
below
the
shriveled
canvas
of
an
old
puritan
clergyman
in
wig
and
gown
the
parish
priest
of
a
century
ago
a
friend
of
whitefield
he
is
likely
to
come
under
the
spell
of
this
reverend
ghost
who
haunts
the
manse
and
as
it
rains
and
darkens
and
the
sky
glooms
through
the
dusty
attic
windows
he
is
likely
to
muse
deeply
and
wonderingly
upon
the
humiliating
fact
that
the
works
of
man
intellect
decay
like
those
of
his
hands
that
thought
grows
moldy
and
as
the
garret
is
in
massachusetts
the
thought
and
the
mold
are
likely
to
be
quite
native
when
the
same
anyone
puts
his
poetry
into
novels
rather
than
essays
he
is
likely
to
have
more
to
say
about
the
life
around
him
about
the
inherited
mystery
of
the
town
than
a
poet
of
philosophy
is
in
hawthorne
usual
vicinity
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
the
somber
errors
and
romance
of
eighteenth
century
new
england
ascetic
or
noble
new
england
as
you
like
a
novel
of
necessity
nails
an
down
to
some
definite
part
or
parts
of
the
surface
the
novelist
wagon
ca
always
be
hitched
to
a
star
to
say
that
hawthorne
was
more
deeply
interested
than
some
of
the
other
concord
writers
emerson
for
example
in
the
idealism
peculiar
to
his
native
land
in
so
far
as
such
idealism
of
a
country
can
be
conceived
of
as
separate
from
the
political
would
be
as
unreasoning
as
to
hold
that
he
was
more
interested
in
social
progress
than
thoreau
because
he
was
in
the
consular
service
and
thoreau
was
in
no
one
service
or
that
the
war
governor
of
massachusetts
was
a
greater
patriot
than
wendell
phillips
who
was
ashamed
of
all
political
parties
art
was
true
and
typically
american
as
is
the
art
of
all
men
living
in
america
who
believe
in
freedom
of
thought
and
who
live
wholesome
lives
to
prove
it
whatever
their
means
of
expression
any
comprehensive
conception
of
hawthorne
either
in
words
or
music
must
have
for
its
basic
theme
something
that
has
to
do
with
the
influence
of
sin
upon
the
conscience
something
more
than
the
puritan
conscience
but
something
which
is
permeated
by
it
in
this
relation
he
is
wont
to
use
what
hazlitt
calls
the
moral
power
of
imagination
hawthorne
would
try
to
spiritualize
a
guilty
conscience
he
would
sing
of
the
relentlessness
of
guilt
the
inheritance
of
guilt
the
shadow
of
guilt
darkening
innocent
posterity
all
of
its
sins
and
morbid
horrors
its
specters
its
phantasmas
and
even
its
hellish
hopelessness
play
around
his
pages
and
vanishing
between
the
lines
are
the
less
guilty
elves
of
the
concord
elms
which
thoreau
and
old
man
alcott
may
have
felt
but
knew
not
as
intimately
as
hawthorne
there
is
often
a
pervading
melancholy
about
hawthorne
as
faguet
says
of
de
musset
without
posture
without
noise
but
penetrating
there
is
at
times
the
mysticism
and
serenity
of
the
ocean
which
jules
michelet
sees
in
its
horizon
rather
than
in
its
waters
there
is
a
sensitiveness
to
supernatural
sound
waves
hawthorne
feels
the
mysteries
and
tries
to
paint
them
rather
than
explain
them
and
here
some
may
say
that
he
is
wiser
in
a
more
practical
way
and
so
more
artistic
than
emerson
perhaps
so
but
no
greater
in
the
deeper
ranges
and
profound
mysteries
of
the
interrelated
worlds
of
human
and
spiritual
life
this
fundamental
part
of
hawthorne
is
not
attempted
in
our
music
the
movement
of
the
series
which
is
but
an
extended
fragment
trying
to
suggest
some
of
his
wilder
fantastical
adventures
into
the
phantasmal
realms
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
children
excitement
on
that
frosty
berkshire
morning
and
the
frost
imagery
on
the
enchanted
hall
window
or
something
to
do
with
feathertop
the
scarecrow
and
his
looking
glass
and
the
little
demons
dancing
around
his
pipe
bowl
or
something
to
do
with
the
old
hymn
tune
that
haunts
the
church
and
sings
only
to
those
in
the
churchyard
to
protect
them
from
secular
noises
as
when
the
circus
parade
comes
down
main
street
or
something
to
do
with
the
concert
at
the
stamford
camp
meeting
or
the
slave
shuffle
or
something
to
do
with
the
concord
or
the
seven
vagabonds
or
palace
or
something
else
in
the
wonderbook
not
something
that
happens
but
the
way
something
happens
or
something
to
do
with
the
celestial
railroad
or
phoebe
garden
or
something
personal
which
tries
to
be
national
suddenly
at
twilight
and
universal
suddenly
at
midnight
or
something
about
the
ghost
of
a
man
who
never
lived
or
about
something
that
never
will
happen
or
something
else
that
is
not
iv
the
alcotts
if
the
dictagraph
had
been
perfected
in
bronson
alcott
time
he
might
now
be
a
great
writer
as
it
is
he
goes
down
as
concord
greatest
talker
great
expecter
says
thoreau
great
feller
says
sam
staples
for
talkin
big
but
his
daughters
is
the
gals
though
always
doin
somethin
old
man
alcott
however
was
usually
doin
somethin
within
an
internal
grandiloquence
made
him
melodious
without
an
exuberant
irrepressible
visionary
absorbed
with
philosophy
as
such
to
him
it
was
a
kind
of
transcendental
business
the
profits
of
which
supported
his
inner
man
rather
than
his
family
apparently
his
deep
interest
in
spiritual
physics
rather
than
metaphysics
gave
a
kind
of
hypnotic
mellifluous
effect
to
his
voice
when
he
sang
his
oracles
a
manner
something
of
a
cross
between
an
inside
pompous
and
an
outside
serious
benevolence
but
he
was
sincere
and
kindly
intentioned
in
his
eagerness
to
extend
what
he
could
of
the
better
influence
of
the
philosophic
world
as
he
saw
it
in
fact
there
is
a
strong
didactic
streak
in
both
father
and
daughter
louisa
may
seldom
misses
a
chance
to
bring
out
the
moral
of
a
homely
virtue
the
power
of
repetition
was
to
them
a
natural
means
of
illustration
it
is
said
that
the
elder
alcott
while
teaching
school
would
frequently
whip
himself
when
the
scholars
misbehaved
to
show
that
the
divine
pained
when
his
children
of
the
earth
were
bad
quite
often
the
boy
next
to
the
bad
boy
was
punished
to
show
how
sin
involved
the
guiltless
and
miss
alcott
is
fond
of
working
her
story
around
so
that
she
can
better
rub
in
a
moral
precept
and
the
moral
sometimes
browbeats
the
story
but
with
all
the
elder
vehement
impracticable
visionary
qualities
there
was
a
sturdiness
and
a
courage
at
least
we
like
to
think
so
a
yankee
boy
who
would
cheerfully
travel
in
those
days
when
distances
were
long
and
unmotored
as
far
from
connecticut
as
the
carolinas
earning
his
way
by
peddling
laying
down
his
pack
to
teach
school
when
opportunity
offered
must
possess
a
basic
sturdiness
this
was
apparently
not
very
evident
when
he
got
to
preaching
his
idealism
an
incident
in
life
helps
confirm
a
theory
not
a
popular
one
that
men
accustomed
to
wander
around
in
the
visionary
unknown
are
the
quickest
and
strongest
when
occasion
requires
ready
action
of
the
lower
virtues
it
often
appears
that
a
contemplative
mind
is
more
capable
of
action
than
an
actively
objective
one
emerson
says
it
is
good
to
know
that
it
has
been
recorded
of
alcott
the
benign
idealist
that
when
the
rev
thomas
wentworth
higginson
heading
the
rush
on
the
court
house
in
boston
to
rescue
a
fugitive
slave
looked
back
for
his
following
at
the
door
only
the
apostolic
philosopher
was
there
cane
in
hand
so
it
seems
that
his
idealism
had
some
substantial
virtues
even
if
he
could
make
a
living
the
daughter
does
not
accept
the
father
as
a
prototype
she
seems
to
have
but
few
of
her
father
qualities
in
female
she
supported
the
family
and
at
the
same
time
enriched
the
lives
of
a
large
part
of
young
america
starting
off
many
little
minds
with
wholesome
thoughts
and
many
little
hearts
with
wholesome
emotions
she
leaves
of
healthy
new
england
childhood
days
pictures
which
are
turned
to
with
affection
by
children
pictures
that
bear
a
sentiment
a
leaven
that
america
needs
nowadays
more
than
we
care
to
admit
concord
village
itself
reminds
one
of
that
common
virtue
lying
at
the
height
and
root
of
all
the
concord
divinities
as
one
walks
down
the
street
passing
the
white
house
of
emerson
ascetic
guard
of
a
former
prophetic
beauty
he
comes
presently
beneath
the
old
elms
overspreading
the
alcott
house
it
seems
to
stand
as
a
kind
of
homely
but
beautiful
witness
of
concord
common
virtue
it
seems
to
bear
a
consciousness
that
its
past
is
living
that
the
mosses
of
the
old
manse
and
the
hickories
of
walden
are
not
far
away
here
is
the
home
of
the
marches
all
pervaded
with
the
trials
and
happiness
of
the
family
and
telling
in
a
simple
way
the
story
of
the
richness
of
not
having
within
the
house
on
every
side
lie
remembrances
of
what
imagination
can
do
for
the
better
amusement
of
fortunate
children
who
have
to
do
for
lessons
in
these
days
of
automatic
easy
entertainment
which
deaden
rather
than
stimulate
the
creative
faculty
and
there
sits
the
little
old
sophia
thoreau
gave
to
the
alcott
children
on
which
beth
played
the
old
scotch
airs
and
played
at
the
fifth
symphony
there
is
a
commonplace
beauty
about
orchard
house
a
kind
of
spiritual
sturdiness
underlying
its
quaint
picturesqueness
a
kind
of
common
triad
of
the
new
england
homestead
whose
overtones
tell
us
that
there
must
have
been
something
aesthetic
fibered
in
the
puritan
severity
the
part
of
the
ideal
a
value
that
seems
to
stir
a
deeper
feeling
a
stronger
sense
of
being
nearer
some
perfect
truth
than
a
gothic
cathedral
or
an
etruscan
villa
all
around
you
under
the
concord
sky
there
still
floats
the
influence
of
that
human
faith
melody
transcendent
and
sentimental
enough
for
the
enthusiast
or
the
cynic
respectively
reflecting
an
innate
hope
a
common
interest
in
common
things
and
common
men
a
tune
the
concord
bards
are
ever
playing
while
they
pound
away
at
the
immensities
with
a
beethovenlike
sublimity
and
with
may
we
say
a
vehemence
and
perseverance
for
that
part
of
greatness
is
not
so
difficult
to
emulate
we
dare
not
attempt
to
follow
the
philosophic
raptures
of
bronson
alcott
unless
you
will
assume
that
his
apotheosis
will
show
how
practical
his
vision
in
this
world
would
be
in
the
next
and
so
we
wo
try
to
reconcile
the
music
sketch
of
the
alcotts
with
much
besides
the
memory
of
that
home
under
the
elms
the
scotch
songs
and
the
family
hymns
that
were
sung
at
the
end
of
each
day
though
there
may
be
an
attempt
to
catch
something
of
that
common
sentiment
which
we
have
tried
to
suggest
above
strength
of
hope
that
never
gives
way
to
despair
a
conviction
in
the
power
of
the
common
soul
which
when
all
is
said
and
done
may
be
as
typical
as
any
theme
of
concord
and
its
transcendentalists
v
thoreau
thoreau
was
a
great
musician
not
because
he
played
the
flute
but
because
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
boston
to
hear
the
symphony
the
rhythm
of
his
prose
were
there
nothing
else
would
determine
his
value
as
a
composer
he
was
divinely
conscious
of
the
enthusiasm
of
nature
the
emotion
of
her
rhythms
and
the
harmony
of
her
solitude
in
this
consciousness
he
sang
of
the
submission
to
nature
the
religion
of
contemplation
and
the
freedom
of
simplicity
a
philosophy
distinguishing
between
the
complexity
of
nature
which
teaches
freedom
and
the
complexity
of
materialism
which
teaches
slavery
in
music
in
poetry
in
all
art
the
truth
as
one
sees
it
must
be
given
in
terms
which
bear
some
proportion
to
the
inspiration
in
their
greatest
moments
the
inspiration
of
both
beethoven
and
thoreau
express
profound
truths
and
deep
sentiment
but
the
intimate
passion
of
it
the
storm
and
stress
of
it
affected
beethoven
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
not
but
be
ever
showing
it
and
thoreau
that
he
could
not
easily
expose
it
they
were
equally
imbued
with
it
but
with
different
results
a
difference
in
temperament
had
something
to
do
with
this
together
with
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
expression
between
the
two
arts
who
that
has
heard
a
strain
of
music
feared
lest
he
would
speak
extravagantly
forever
says
thoreau
perhaps
music
is
the
art
of
speaking
extravagantly
herbert
spencer
says
that
some
men
as
for
instance
mozart
are
so
peculiarly
sensitive
to
emotion
that
music
is
to
them
but
a
continuation
not
only
of
the
expression
but
of
the
actual
emotion
though
the
theory
of
some
more
modern
thinkers
in
the
philosophy
of
art
does
always
bear
this
out
however
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
its
nature
music
is
predominantly
subjective
and
tends
to
subjective
expression
and
poetry
more
objective
tending
to
objective
expression
hence
the
poet
when
his
muse
calls
for
a
deeper
feeling
must
invert
this
order
and
he
may
be
reluctant
to
do
so
as
these
depths
often
call
for
an
intimate
expression
which
the
physical
looks
of
the
words
may
repel
they
tend
to
reveal
the
nakedness
of
his
soul
rather
than
its
warmth
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
relative
value
of
the
aspiration
or
a
difference
between
subconsciousness
and
consciousness
but
a
difference
in
the
arts
themselves
for
example
a
composer
may
not
shrink
from
having
the
public
hear
his
love
letter
in
tones
while
a
poet
may
feel
sensitive
about
having
everyone
read
his
letter
in
words
when
the
object
of
the
love
is
mankind
the
sensitiveness
is
changed
only
in
degree
but
the
message
of
thoreau
though
his
fervency
may
be
inconstant
and
his
human
appeal
not
always
direct
is
both
in
thought
and
spirit
as
universal
as
that
of
any
man
who
ever
wrote
or
sang
as
universal
as
it
is
nontemporaneous
as
universal
as
it
is
free
from
the
measure
of
history
as
solitude
is
free
from
the
measure
of
the
miles
of
space
that
intervene
between
man
and
his
fellows
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
henry
james
who
knows
almost
everything
says
that
thoreau
is
more
than
provincial
that
he
is
parochial
let
us
repeat
that
henry
thoreau
in
respect
to
thought
sentiment
imagination
and
soul
in
respect
to
every
element
except
that
of
place
of
physical
being
a
thing
that
means
so
much
to
some
is
as
universal
as
any
personality
in
literature
that
he
said
upon
being
shown
a
specimen
grass
from
iceland
that
the
same
species
could
be
found
in
concord
is
evidence
of
his
universality
not
of
his
parochialism
he
was
so
universal
that
he
did
not
need
to
travel
around
the
world
to
prove
it
i
have
more
of
god
they
more
of
the
road
it
is
not
worth
while
to
go
around
the
world
to
count
the
cats
in
zanzibar
with
marcus
aurelius
if
he
had
seen
the
present
he
had
seen
all
from
eternity
and
all
time
forever
thoreau
susceptibility
to
natural
sounds
was
probably
greater
than
that
of
many
practical
musicians
true
this
appeal
is
mainly
through
the
sensational
element
which
herbert
spencer
thinks
the
predominant
beauty
of
music
thoreau
seems
able
to
weave
from
this
source
some
perfect
transcendental
symphonies
strains
from
the
orient
get
the
best
of
some
of
the
modern
french
music
but
not
of
thoreau
he
seems
more
interested
in
than
influenced
by
oriental
philosophy
he
admires
its
ways
of
resignation
and
but
he
does
contemplate
himself
in
the
same
way
he
often
quotes
from
the
eastern
scriptures
passages
which
were
they
his
own
he
would
probably
omit
the
vedas
say
all
intelligences
awake
with
the
morning
this
seems
unworthy
of
accompanying
the
undulations
of
celestial
music
found
on
this
same
page
in
which
an
ode
to
morning
is
sung
the
awakening
to
newly
acquired
forces
and
aspirations
from
within
to
a
higher
life
than
we
fell
asleep
from
for
all
memorable
events
transpire
in
the
morning
time
and
in
the
morning
atmosphere
thus
it
is
not
the
whole
tone
scale
of
the
orient
but
the
scale
of
a
walden
morning
music
in
single
strains
as
emerson
says
which
inspired
many
of
the
polyphonies
and
harmonies
that
come
to
us
through
his
poetry
who
can
be
forever
melancholy
with
aeolian
music
like
this
this
is
but
one
of
many
ways
in
which
thoreau
looked
to
nature
for
his
greatest
inspirations
in
her
he
found
an
analogy
to
the
fundamental
of
transcendentalism
the
innate
goodness
of
nature
is
or
can
be
a
moral
influence
mother
nature
if
man
will
but
let
her
will
keep
him
straight
straight
spiritually
and
so
morally
and
even
mentally
if
he
will
take
her
as
a
companion
and
teacher
and
not
as
a
duty
or
a
creed
she
will
give
him
greater
thrills
and
teach
him
greater
truths
than
man
can
give
or
teach
she
will
reveal
mysteries
that
mankind
has
long
concealed
it
was
the
soul
of
nature
not
natural
history
that
thoreau
was
after
a
naturalist
mind
is
one
predominantly
scientific
more
interested
in
the
relation
of
a
flower
to
other
flowers
than
its
relation
to
any
philosophy
or
anyone
philosophy
a
transcendent
love
of
nature
and
writing
rhus
glabra
after
sumac
does
necessarily
make
a
naturalist
it
would
seem
that
although
thorough
in
observation
not
very
thorough
according
to
burroughs
and
with
a
keen
perception
of
the
specific
a
naturalist
inherently
was
exactly
what
thoreau
was
not
he
seems
rather
to
let
nature
put
him
under
her
microscope
than
to
hold
her
under
his
he
was
too
fond
of
nature
to
practice
vivisection
upon
her
he
would
have
found
that
painful
for
was
he
not
a
part
with
her
but
he
had
this
trait
of
a
naturalist
which
is
usually
foreign
to
poets
even
great
ones
he
observed
acutely
even
things
that
did
not
particularly
interest
him
a
useful
natural
gift
rather
than
a
virtue
the
study
of
nature
may
tend
to
make
one
dogmatic
but
the
love
of
nature
surely
does
not
thoreau
no
more
than
emerson
could
be
said
to
have
compounded
doctrines
his
thinking
was
too
broad
for
that
if
thoreau
was
a
religion
of
nature
as
some
say
and
by
that
they
mean
that
through
nature
influence
man
is
brought
to
a
deeper
contemplation
to
a
more
spiritual
and
thus
closer
to
god
it
had
apparently
no
definite
doctrines
some
of
his
theories
regarding
natural
and
social
phenomena
and
his
experiments
in
the
art
of
living
are
certainly
not
doctrinal
in
form
and
if
they
are
in
substance
it
did
disturb
thoreau
and
it
need
us
in
proportion
as
he
simplifies
his
life
the
laws
of
the
universe
will
appear
less
complex
and
solitude
will
not
be
solitude
nor
poverty
poverty
nor
weakness
weakness
if
you
have
built
castles
in
the
air
your
work
need
not
be
lost
that
is
where
they
should
be
now
put
the
foundations
under
them
then
we
will
love
with
the
license
of
a
higher
order
of
beings
is
that
a
doctrine
perhaps
at
any
rate
between
the
lines
of
some
such
passage
as
this
lie
some
of
the
fountain
heads
that
water
the
spiritual
fields
of
his
philosophy
and
the
seeds
from
which
they
are
sown
if
indeed
his
whole
philosophy
is
but
one
spiritual
garden
his
experiments
social
and
economic
are
a
part
of
its
cultivation
and
for
the
harvest
and
its
transmutation
he
trusts
to
moments
of
inspiration
only
what
is
thought
said
and
done
at
a
certain
rare
coincidence
is
good
thoreau
experiment
at
walden
was
broadly
speaking
one
of
these
moments
it
stands
out
in
the
casual
and
popular
opinion
as
a
kind
of
adventure
harmless
and
amusing
to
some
significant
and
important
to
others
but
its
significance
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
trying
to
practice
an
ideal
he
prepared
his
mind
so
that
it
could
better
bring
others
into
the
he
did
not
ask
for
a
literal
approval
or
in
fact
for
any
approval
i
would
not
stand
between
any
man
and
his
genius
he
would
have
no
one
adopt
his
manner
of
life
unless
in
doing
so
he
adopts
his
own
besides
by
that
time
i
may
have
found
a
better
one
but
if
he
preached
hard
he
practiced
harder
what
he
preached
harder
than
most
men
throughout
walden
a
text
that
he
is
always
pounding
out
is
time
time
for
inside
work
preferably
though
you
perhaps
may
have
some
pleasant
thrilling
glorious
hours
even
in
a
poor
house
wherever
the
place
time
there
must
be
time
to
show
the
unnecessariness
of
necessities
which
clog
up
time

to
contemplate
the
value
of
man
to
the
universe

the
art
of
living
thoreau
has
been
criticized
for
practicing
his
policy
of
expansion
by
living
in
a
vacuum
but
he
peopled
that
vacuum
with
a
race
of
beings
and
established
a
social
order
there
surpassing
any
of
the
precepts
in
social
or
political
history
for
he
put
some
things
behind
and
passed
an
invisible
boundary
new
universal
and
more
liberal
laws
were
around
and
within
him
the
old
laws
were
expanded
and
interpreted
in
a
more
liberal
sense
and
he
lived
with
the
license
of
a
higher
order
a
community
in
which
god
was
the
only
president
and
thoreau
not
webster
was
his
orator
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
thoreau
really
refused
to
believe
that
there
was
any
other
life
but
his
own
though
he
probably
did
think
that
there
was
not
any
other
life
besides
his
own
for
him
living
for
society
may
not
always
be
best
accomplished
by
living
with
society
is
there
any
virtue
in
a
man
skin
that
you
must
touch
it
and
the
rubbing
of
elbows
may
not
bring
men
minds
closer
together
or
if
he
were
talking
through
a
worst
seller
magazine
that
had
to
put
it
over
he
might
say
forty
thousand
souls
at
a
ball
game
does
not
necessarily
make
baseball
the
highest
expression
of
spiritual
emotion
thoreau
however
is
no
cynic
either
in
character
or
thought
though
in
a
side
glance
at
himself
he
may
have
held
out
to
be
one
a
cynic
in
independence
possibly
because
of
his
rule
laid
down
that
admits
of
no
compromise
it
is
conceivable
that
though
some
of
his
philosophy
and
a
good
deal
of
his
personality
in
some
of
its
manifestations
have
outward
colors
that
do
not
seem
to
harmonize
the
true
and
intimate
relations
they
bear
each
other
are
not
affected
this
peculiarity
frequently
seen
in
his
attitude
towards
problems
is
perhaps
more
emphasized
in
some
of
his
personal
outbursts
i
love
my
friends
very
much
but
i
find
that
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
to
see
them
i
hate
them
commonly
when
i
am
near
it
is
easier
to
see
what
he
means
than
it
is
to
forgive
him
for
saying
it
the
cause
of
this
apparent
lack
of
harmony
between
philosophy
and
personality
as
far
as
they
can
be
separated
may
have
been
due
to
his
refusal
to
keep
the
very
delicate
balance
which
van
doren
in
his
critical
study
of
thoreau
says
it
is
necessary
for
a
great
and
good
man
to
keep
between
his
public
and
private
lives
between
his
own
personality
and
the
whole
outside
universe
of
personalities
somehow
one
feels
that
if
he
had
kept
this
balance
he
would
have
lost
hitting
power
again
it
seems
that
something
of
the
above
depends
upon
the
degree
of
greatness
or
goodness
a
very
great
and
especially
a
very
good
man
has
no
separate
private
and
public
life
his
own
personality
though
not
identical
with
outside
personalities
is
so
clear
or
can
be
so
clear
to
them
that
it
appears
identical
and
as
the
world
progresses
towards
its
inevitable
perfection
this
appearance
becomes
more
and
more
a
reality
for
the
same
reason
that
all
great
men
now
agree
in
principle
but
not
in
detail
in
so
far
as
words
are
able
to
communicate
agreement
on
the
great
fundamental
truths
someone
says
be
specific
what
great
fundamentals
freedom
over
slavery
the
natural
over
the
artificial
beauty
over
ugliness
the
spiritual
over
the
material
the
goodness
of
man
the
godness
of
man
have
been
greater
if
he
had
written
plays
some
say
that
a
true
composer
will
never
write
an
opera
because
a
truly
brave
man
will
not
take
a
drink
to
keep
up
his
courage
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
shakespeare
is
not
the
greatest
figure
in
all
literature
in
fact
it
is
an
attempt
to
say
that
many
novels
most
operas
all
shakespeares
and
all
brave
men
and
women
rum
or
no
rum
are
among
the
noblest
blessings
with
which
god
has
endowed
mankind
because
not
being
perfect
they
are
perfect
examples
pointing
to
that
perfection
which
nothing
yet
has
attained
thoreau
mysticism
at
times
throws
him
into
elusive
moods
but
an
elusiveness
held
by
a
thread
to
something
concrete
and
specific
for
he
had
too
much
integrity
of
mind
for
any
other
kind
in
these
moments
it
is
easier
to
follow
his
thought
than
to
follow
him
indeed
if
he
were
always
easy
to
follow
after
one
had
caught
up
with
him
one
might
find
that
it
was
not
thoreau
it
is
however
with
no
mystic
rod
that
he
strikes
at
institutional
life
here
again
he
felt
the
influence
of
the
great
transcendental
doctrine
of
innate
goodness
in
human
nature
a
reflection
of
the
like
in
nature
a
philosophic
part
which
by
the
way
was
a
more
direct
inheritance
in
thoreau
than
in
his
brother
transcendentalists
for
besides
what
he
received
from
a
native
unitarianism
a
good
part
must
have
descended
to
him
through
his
huguenot
blood
from
the
french
philosophy
we
trace
a
reason
here
for
his
lack
of
interest
in
the
church
for
if
revealed
religion
is
the
path
between
god
and
man
spiritual
part
a
kind
of
formal
causeway
thoreau
highly
developed
spiritual
life
felt
apparently
unconsciously
less
need
of
it
than
most
men
but
he
might
have
been
more
charitable
towards
those
who
do
need
it
and
most
of
us
do
if
he
had
been
more
conscious
of
his
freedom
those
who
look
today
for
the
cause
of
a
seeming
deterioration
in
the
influence
of
the
church
may
find
it
in
a
wider
development
of
this
feeling
of
thoreau
that
the
need
is
less
because
there
is
more
of
the
spirit
of
christianity
in
the
world
today
another
cause
for
his
attitude
towards
the
church
as
an
institution
is
one
always
too
common
among
the
narrow
minds
to
have
influenced
thoreau
he
could
have
been
more
generous
he
took
the
arc
for
the
circle
the
exception
for
the
rule
the
solitary
bad
example
for
the
many
good
ones
his
persistent
emphasis
on
the
value
of
example
may
excuse
this
lower
viewpoint
the
silent
influence
of
the
example
of
one
sincere
life
has
benefited
society
more
than
all
the
projects
devised
for
its
salvation
he
has
little
patience
for
the
unpracticing
preacher
in
some
countries
a
hunting
parson
is
no
uncommon
sight
such
a
one
might
make
a
good
shepherd
dog
but
is
far
from
being
a
good
shepherd
it
would
have
been
interesting
to
have
seen
him
handle
the
speculating
parson
who
takes
a
good
salary
more
per
annum
than
all
the
disciples
had
to
sustain
their
bodies
during
their
whole
lives
from
a
metropolitan
religious
corporation
for
speculating
on
sunday
about
the
beauty
of
poverty
who
preaches
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
nor
yet
what
ye
shall
put
on
lay
not
up
for
yourself
treasure
upon
earth
take
up
thy
cross
and
follow
me
who
on
monday
becomes
a
speculating
disciple
of
another
god
and
by
questionable
investments
successful
enough
to
get
into
the
press
seeks
to
lay
up
a
treasure
of
a
million
dollars
for
his
old
age
as
if
a
million
dollars
could
keep
such
a
man
out
of
the
thoreau
might
observe
that
this
one
good
example
of
christian
degeneracy
undoes
all
the
acts
of
regeneracy
of
a
thousand
humble
country
parsons
that
it
the
unconscious
influence
of
a
dozen
bushnells
if
there
be
that
many
that
the
repentance
of
this
man
who
did
not
fall
from
grace
because
he
never
fell
into
it
that
this
unnecessary
repentance
might
save
this
man
own
soul
but
not
necessarily
the
souls
of
the
million
readers
that
repentance
would
put
this
preacher
right
with
the
powers
that
be
in
this
world
and
the
next
thoreau
might
pass
a
remark
upon
this
intimacy
with
god
as
if
he
had
a
monopoly
of
the
subject
an
intimacy
that
perhaps
kept
him
from
asking
god
exactly
what
his
son
meant
by
the
camel
the
needle
to
say
nothing
of
the
rich
man
thoreau
might
have
wondered
how
this
man
nailed
down
the
last
plank
in
his
bridge
to
salvation
by
rising
to
sublime
heights
of
patriotism
in
his
war
against
materialism
but
would
even
thoreau
be
so
unfeeling
as
to
suggest
to
this
exhorter
that
his
salvation
might
be
clinched
if
he
would
sacrifice
his
income
not
himself
and
come
in
to
a
real
salvation
army
or
that
the
final
triumph
the
supreme
happiness
in
casting
aside
this
mere
or
every
year
must
be
denied
him
for
was
he
not
captain
of
the
ship
must
he
not
stick
to
his
passengers
in
the
first
cabin
the
very
first
cabin
not
that
the
ship
was
sinking
but
that
he
was
we
will
go
no
further
even
thoreau
would
not
demand
sacrifice
for
sacrifice
sake
no
not
even
from
nature
property
from
the
standpoint
of
its
influence
in
checking
natural
and
from
the
standpoint
of
personal
and
inherent
right
is
another
institution
that
comes
in
for
straight
and
jabs
now
to
the
stomach
now
to
the
head
but
seldom
sparring
for
breath
for
does
he
not
say
that
wherever
a
man
goes
men
will
pursue
him
with
their
dirty
institutions
the
influence
of
property
as
he
saw
it
on
morality
or
immorality
and
how
through
this
it
mayor
should
influence
government
is
seen
by
the
following
i
am
convinced
that
if
all
men
were
to
live
as
simply
as
i
did
then
thieving
and
robbery
would
be
unknown
these
take
place
only
in
communities
where
some
have
got
more
than
is
sufficient
while
others
have
not
enough
nec

you
who
govern
public
affairs
what
need
have
you
to
employ
punishments
have
virtue
and
the
people
will
be
virtuous
if
thoreau
had
made
the
first
sentence
read
if
all
men
were
like
me
and
were
to
live
as
simply
everyone
would
agree
with
him
we
may
wonder
here
how
he
would
account
for
some
of
the
degenerate
types
we
are
told
about
in
some
of
our
backwoods
and
mountain
regions
possibly
by
assuming
that
they
are
an
instance
of
perversion
of
the
species
that
the
little
civilizing
their
forbears
experienced
rendered
these
people
more
susceptible
to
the
physical
than
to
the
spiritual
influence
of
nature
in
other
words
if
they
had
been
purer
naturists
as
the
aztecs
for
example
they
would
have
been
purer
men
instead
of
turning
to
any
theory
of
ours
or
of
thoreau
for
the
true
explanation
of
this
condition
which
is
a
kind
of
for
its
true
diagnosis
and
permanent
cure
are
we
not
far
more
certain
to
find
it
in
the
radiant
look
of
humility
love
and
hope
in
the
strong
faces
of
those
inspired
souls
who
are
devoting
their
lives
with
no
little
sacrifice
to
these
outcasts
of
civilization
and
nature
in
truth
may
not
mankind
find
the
solution
of
its
eternal
problem
find
it
after
and
beyond
the
last
most
perfect
system
of
wealth
distribution
which
science
can
ever
devise
after
and
beyond
the
last
sublime
echo
of
the
greatest
socialistic
symphonies
after
and
beyond
every
transcendent
thought
and
expression
in
the
simple
example
of
these
souls
be
they
pagan
gentile
jew
or
angel
however
underlying
the
practical
or
impractical
suggestions
implied
in
the
quotation
above
which
is
from
the
last
paragraph
of
village
is
the
same
transcendental
theme
of
innate
goodness
for
this
reason
there
must
be
no
limitation
except
that
which
will
free
mankind
from
limitation
and
from
a
perversion
of
this
innate
possession
and
property
may
be
one
of
the
causes
of
this
perversion
property
in
the
two
relations
cited
above
it
is
conceivable
that
thoreau
to
the
consternation
of
the
richest
members
of
the
bolsheviki
and
bourgeois
would
propose
a
policy
of
liberation
a
policy
of
a
limited
personal
property
right
on
the
ground
that
congestion
of
personal
property
tends
to
limit
the
progress
of
the
soul
as
well
as
the
progress
of
the
stomach
letting
the
economic
noise
thereupon
take
care
of
itself
for
dissonances
are
becoming
beautiful
and
do
not
the
same
waters
that
roar
in
a
storm
take
care
of
the
eventual
calm
that
this
limit
of
property
be
determined
not
by
the
voice
of
the
majority
but
by
the
brain
of
the
majority
under
a
government
limited
to
no
national
boundaries
the
government
of
the
world
i
live
in
is
not
framed
in
conversation
around
a
table
in
a
capital
city
for
there
is
no
capital
a
government
of
principles
not
parties
of
a
few
fundamental
truths
and
not
of
many
political
expediencies
a
government
conducted
by
virtuous
leaders
for
it
will
be
led
by
all
for
all
are
virtuous
as
then
their
innate
virtue
will
no
more
be
perverted
by
unnatural
institutions
this
will
not
be
a
millennium
but
a
practical
and
possible
application
of
uncommon
common
sense
for
is
it
not
sense
common
or
otherwise
for
nature
to
want
to
hand
back
the
earth
to
those
to
whom
it
belongs
that
is
to
those
who
have
to
live
on
it
is
it
not
sense
that
the
average
brains
like
the
average
stomachs
will
act
rightly
if
they
have
an
equal
amount
of
the
right
kind
of
food
to
act
upon
and
universal
education
is
on
the
way
with
the
right
kind
of
food
is
it
not
sense
then
that
all
grown
men
and
women
for
all
are
necessary
to
work
out
the
divine
law
of
averages
shall
have
a
direct
not
an
indirect
say
about
the
things
that
go
on
in
this
world
some
of
these
attitudes
ungenerous
or
radical
generous
or
conservative
as
you
will
towards
institutions
dear
to
many
have
no
doubt
given
impressions
unfavorable
to
thoreau
thought
and
personality
one
hears
him
called
by
some
who
ought
to
know
what
they
say
and
some
who
ought
not
a
crabbed
yankee
a
kind
of
a
visionary
a
egotistic
recluse
even
but
it
is
easier
to
make
a
statement
than
prove
a
reputation
thoreau
may
be
some
of
these
things
to
those
who
make
no
distinction
between
these
qualities
and
the
manner
which
often
comes
as
a
kind
of
of
an
intense
devotion
of
a
principle
or
ideal
he
was
rude
and
unfriendly
at
times
but
shyness
probably
had
something
to
do
with
that
in
spite
of
a
certain
he
was
diffident
in
most
company
but
though
he
may
have
been
subject
to
those
spells
when
words
do
not
rise
and
the
mind
seems
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
dull
cloth
which
everyone
dumbly
stares
at
instead
of
looking
through
he
would
easily
get
off
a
rejoinder
upon
occasion
when
a
party
of
visitors
came
to
walden
and
some
one
asked
thoreau
if
he
found
it
lonely
there
he
replied
only
by
your
help
a
remark
characteristic
true
rude
if
not
witty
the
writer
remembers
hearing
a
schoolteacher
in
english
literature
dismiss
thoreau
and
a
half
hour
lesson
in
which
time
all
of
walden
its
surface
was
sailed
over
by
saying
that
this
author
he
called
everyone
author
from
solomon
down
to
parkhurst
was
a
kind
of
a
crank
who
styled
himself
a
and
who
idled
about
the
woods
because
he
did
want
to
work
some
such
stuff
is
a
common
conception
though
not
as
common
as
it
used
to
be
if
this
teacher
had
had
more
brains
it
would
have
been
a
lie
the
word
idled
is
the
hopeless
part
of
this
criticism
or
rather
of
this
uncritical
remark
to
ask
this
kind
of
a
man
who
plays
all
the
choice
gems
from
celebrated
composers
literally
always
literally
and
always
with
the
loud
pedal
who
plays
all
hymns
wrong
notes
right
notes
games
people

literally

who
will
die
literally
and
with
the
loud
pedal
to
ask
this
man
to
smile
even
faintly
at
thoreau
humor
is
like
casting
a
pearl
before
a
coal
baron
emerson
implies
that
there
is
one
thing
a
genius
must
have
to
be
a

that
is
mother

doctor
johnson
milton

aunt
mary
moody
emerson
has
it
and
can
write
scrap
letters
who
has
it
need
never
write
anything
but
scraps
henry
thoreau
has
it
his
humor
though
a
part
of
this
wit
is
not
always
as
spontaneous
for
it
is
sometimes
pun
shape
so
is
charles
lamb
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
kind
that
can
serenely
transport
us
and
which
we
can
enjoy
without
disturbing
our
neighbors
if
there
are
those
who
think
him
and
with
but
little
human
sympathy
let
them
read
his
letters
to
emerson
little
daughter
or
hear
emerson
tell
about
the
thoreau
home
life
and
the
stories
of
his
boyhood
the
ministrations
to
a
runaway
slave
or
let
them
ask
old
sam
staples
the
concord
sheriff
about
him
that
he
was
fond
of
a
few
intimate
friends
but
cared
not
one
fig
for
people
in
the
mass
is
a
statement
made
in
a
school
history
and
which
is
superficially
true
he
cared
too
much
for
the
masses
too
much
to
let
his
personality
be
massed
too
much
to
be
unable
to
realize
the
futility
of
wearing
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
but
not
of
wearing
his
path
to
the
shore
of
walden
for
future
masses
to
walk
over
and
perchance
find
the
way
to
themselves
some
are
fond
of
telling
us
that
thoreau
came
so
close
to
nature
that
she
killed
him
before
he
had
discovered
her
whole
secret
they
remind
us
that
he
died
with
consumption
but
forget
that
he
lived
with
consumption
and
without
using
much
charity
this
can
be
made
to
excuse
many
of
his
irascible
and
uncongenial
moods
you
to
whom
that
gaunt
face
seems
forbidding
look
into
the
eyes
if
he
seems
dry
and
priggish
to
you
stevenson
with
little
of
that
large
unconscious
geniality
of
the
world
heroes
follow
him
some
spring
morning
to
baker
farm
as
he
rambles
through
pine
groves
like
temples
or
like
fleets
at
sea
with
wavy
boughs
and
rippling
with
light
so
soft
and
green
and
shady
that
the
druids
would
have
forsaken
their
oaks
to
worship
in
them
follow
him
to
the
cedar
wood
beyond
flint
pond
where
the
trees
covered
with
hoary
blue
berries
spiring
higher
and
higher
are
fit
to
stand
before
valhalla
follow
him
but
not
too
closely
for
you
may
see
little
if
you
do
as
he
walks
in
so
pure
and
bright
a
light
gilding
its
withered
grass
and
leaves
so
softly
and
serenely
bright
that
he
thinks
he
has
never
bathed
in
such
a
golden
flood
follow
him
as
he
saunters
towards
the
holy
land
till
one
day
the
sun
shall
shine
more
brightly
than
ever
it
has
done
perchance
shine
into
your
minds
and
hearts
and
light
up
your
whole
lives
with
a
great
awakening
light
as
warm
and
serene
and
golden
as
on
a
bankside
in
autumn
follow
him
through
the
golden
flood
to
the
shore
of
that
holy
land
where
he
lies
dying
as
men
say
dying
as
bravely
as
he
lived
you
may
be
near
when
his
stern
old
aunt
in
the
duty
of
her
puritan
conscience
asks
him
have
you
made
your
peace
with
god
and
you
may
see
his
kindly
smile
as
he
replies
i
did
not
know
that
we
had
ever
quarreled
moments
like
these
reflect
more
nobility
and
equanimity
perhaps
than
geniality
qualities
however
more
serviceable
to
world
heroes
the
personal
trait
that
one
who
has
affection
for
thoreau
may
find
worst
is
a
combative
streak
in
which
he
too
often
takes
refuge
an
obstinate
elusiveness
almost
a
contrary
cussedness
as
if
he
would
say
which
he
did
if
a
truth
about
something
is
not
as
i
think
it
ought
to
be
i
make
it
what
i
think
and
it
will
be
the
truth
but
if
you
agree
with
me
then
i
begin
to
think
it
may
not
be
the
truth
the
causes
of
these
unpleasant
colors
rather
than
characteristics
are
too
easily
attributed
to
a
lack
of
human
sympathy
or
to
the
assumption
that
they
are
at
least
symbols
of
that
lack
instead
of
to
a
supersensitiveness
magnified
at
times
by
ill
health
and
at
times
by
a
subconsciousness
of
the
futility
of
actually
living
out
his
ideals
in
this
life
it
has
been
said
that
his
brave
hopes
were
unrealized
anywhere
in
his
career
but
it
is
certain
that
they
started
to
be
realized
on
or
about
may
and
we
doubt
if
will
end
their
fulfillment
or
his
career
but
there
were
many
in
concord
who
knew
that
within
their
village
there
was
a
tree
of
wondrous
growth
the
shadow
of
which
alas
too
frequently
was
the
only
part
they
were
allowed
to
touch
emerson
was
one
of
these
he
was
not
only
deeply
conscious
of
thoreau
rare
gifts
but
in
the
woodland
notes
pays
a
tribute
to
a
side
of
his
friend
that
many
others
missed
emerson
knew
that
sensibilities
too
often
veiled
his
nobilities
that
a
stoicism
ever
fortified
with
sarcasm
none
the
less
securely
because
it
seemed
voluntary
covered
a
warmth
of
feeling
his
great
heart
him
a
hermit
made
a
breadth
of
heart
not
easily
measured
found
only
in
the
highest
type
of
sentimentalists
the
type
which
does
not
perpetually
discriminate
in
favor
of
mankind
emerson
has
much
of
this
sentiment
and
touches
it
when
he
sings
of
nature
as
the
incarnation
of
a
thought
when
he
generously
visualizes
thoreau
standing
at
the
walden
shore
invoking
the
vision
of
a
thought
as
it
drifts
heavenward
into
an
incarnation
of
nature
there
is
a
godlike
patience
in
nature
her
mists
her
trees
her
mountains
as
if
she
had
a
more
abiding
faith
and
a
clearer
vision
than
man
of
the
resurrection
and
immortality
there
comes
to
memory
an
old
composition
of
days
whose
peroration
closed
with
poor
thoreau
he
communed
with
nature
for
forty
odd
years
and
then
died
the
forty
odd
years
we
still
grant
that
part
but
he
is
over
a
hundred
now
and
maybe
lowell
he
is
more
lovable
kindlier
and
more
radiant
with
human
sympathy
today
than
perchance
you
were
fifty
years
ago
it
may
be
that
he
is
a
far
stronger
a
far
greater
an
incalculably
greater
force
in
the
moral
and
spiritual
fibre
of
his
throughout
the
world
today
than
you
dreamed
of
fifty
years
ago
you
james
russell
lowells
you
robert
louis
stevensons
you
mark
van
dorens
with
your
literary
perception
your
power
of
illumination
your
brilliancy
of
expression
yea
and
with
your
love
of
sincerity
you
know
your
thoreau
but
not
my
thoreau
that
reassuring
and
true
friend
who
stood
by
me
one
low
day
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
long
long
before
sunset
you
may
know
something
of
the
affection
that
heart
yearned
for
but
knew
it
a
duty
not
to
grasp
you
may
know
something
of
the
great
human
passions
which
stirred
that
soul
too
deep
for
animate
expression
you
may
know
all
of
this
all
there
is
to
know
about
thoreau
but
you
know
him
not
unless
you
love
him
and
if
there
shall
be
a
program
for
our
music
let
it
follow
his
thought
on
an
autumn
day
of
indian
summer
at
walden
a
shadow
of
a
thought
at
first
colored
by
the
mist
and
haze
over
the
pond
low
anchored
cloud
fountain
head
and
source
of
rivers
dew
cloth
dream
drapery
drifting
meadow
of
the
air
but
this
is
momentary
the
beauty
of
the
day
moves
him
to
a
certain
restlessness
to
aspirations
more
specific
an
eagerness
for
outward
action
but
through
it
all
he
is
conscious
that
it
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
mood
for
this
day
as
the
mists
rise
there
comes
a
clearer
thought
more
traditional
than
the
first
a
meditation
more
calm
as
he
stands
on
the
side
of
the
pleasant
hill
of
pines
and
hickories
in
front
of
his
cabin
he
is
still
disturbed
by
a
restlessness
and
goes
down
the
and
sandy
eastern
shore
but
it
seems
not
to
lead
him
where
the
thought
suggests
he
climbs
the
path
along
the
bolder
northern
and
western
shore
with
deep
bays
indented
and
now
along
the
railroad
track
where
the
aeolian
harp
plays
but
his
eagerness
throws
him
into
the
lithe
springy
stride
of
the
specie
hunter
the
naturalist
he
is
still
aware
of
a
restlessness
with
these
faster
steps
his
rhythm
is
of
shorter
span
it
is
still
not
the
tempo
of
nature
it
does
not
bear
the
mood
that
the
genius
of
the
day
calls
for
it
is
too
specific
its
nature
is
too
external
the
introspection
too
buoyant
and
he
knows
now
that
he
must
let
nature
flow
through
him
and
slowly
he
releases
his
more
personal
desires
to
her
broader
rhythm
conscious
that
this
blends
more
and
more
with
the
harmony
of
her
solitude
it
tells
him
that
his
search
for
freedom
on
that
day
at
least
lies
in
his
submission
to
her
for
nature
is
as
relentless
as
she
is
benignant
he
remains
in
this
mood
and
while
outwardly
still
he
seems
to
move
with
the
slow
almost
monotonous
swaying
beat
of
this
autumnal
day
he
is
more
contented
with
a
homely
burden
and
is
more
assured
of
the
broad
margin
to
his
life
he
sits
in
his
sunny
doorway
rapt
in
revery
amidst
goldenrod
sandcherry
and
sumac
in
undisturbed
solitude
at
times
the
more
definite
personal
strivings
for
the
ideal
freedom
the
former
more
active
speculations
come
over
him
as
if
he
would
trace
a
certain
intensity
even
in
his
submission
he
grew
in
those
seasons
like
corn
in
the
night
and
they
were
better
than
any
works
of
the
hands
they
were
not
time
subtracted
from
his
life
but
so
much
over
and
above
the
usual
allowance
he
realized
what
the
orientals
meant
by
contemplation
and
forsaking
of
works
the
day
advanced
as
if
to
light
some
work
of
his
it
was
morning
and
lo
now
it
is
evening
and
nothing
memorable
is
accomplished
the
evening
train
has
gone
by
and
all
the
restless
world
with
it
the
fishes
in
the
pond
no
longer
feel
its
rumbling
and
he
is
more
alone
than
ever
his
meditations
are
interrupted
only
by
the
faint
sound
of
the
concord
bell
is
night
in
the
village
a
melody
as
it
were
imported
into
the
wilderness
at
a
distance
over
the
woods
the
sound
acquires
a
certain
vibratory
hum
as
if
the
pine
needles
in
the
horizon
were
the
strings
of
a
harp
which
it
swept
a
vibration
of
the
universal
lyre
just
as
the
intervening
atmosphere
makes
a
distant
ridge
of
earth
interesting
to
the
eyes
by
the
azure
tint
it
imparts
part
of
the
echo
may
be
the
voice
of
the
wood
the
same
trivial
words
and
notes
sung
by
the
wood
nymph
it
is
darker
the
poet
flute
is
heard
out
over
the
pond
and
walden
hears
the
swan
song
of
that
day
and
faintly
echoes
is
it
a
transcendental
tune
of
concord
is
an
evening
when
the
whole
body
is
one
sense
and
before
ending
his
day
he
looks
out
over
the
clear
crystalline
water
of
the
pond
and
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
shadow
thought
he
saw
in
the
morning
mist
and
haze
he
knows
that
by
his
final
submission
he
possesses
the
freedom
of
the
night
he
goes
up
the
pleasant
hillside
of
pines
hickories
and
moonlight
to
his
cabin
with
a
strange
liberty
in
nature
a
part
of
herself
vi
epilogue
the
futility
of
attempting
to
trace
the
source
or
primal
impulse
of
an
may
be
admitted
without
granting
that
human
qualities
or
attributes
which
go
with
personality
can
not
be
suggested
and
that
artistic
intuitions
which
parallel
them
can
not
be
reflected
in
music
actually
accomplishing
the
latter
is
a
problem
more
or
less
arbitrary
to
an
open
mind
more
or
less
impossible
to
a
prejudiced
mind
that
which
the
composer
intends
to
represent
as
high
vitality
sounds
like
something
quite
different
to
different
listeners
that
which
i
like
to
think
suggests
thoreau
submission
to
nature
may
to
another
seem
something
like
hawthorne
conception
of
the
relentlessness
of
an
evil
conscience
and
to
the
rest
of
our
friends
but
a
series
of
unpleasant
sounds
how
far
can
the
composer
be
held
accountable
beyond
a
certain
point
the
responsibility
is
more
or
less
undeterminable
the
outside
characteristics
that
is
the
points
furthest
away
from
the
mergings
are
obvious
to
mostly
anyone
a
child
knows
a
strain
of
joy
from
one
of
sorrow
those
a
little
older
know
the
dignified
from
the
frivolous
the
spring
song
from
the
season
in
which
the
melancholy
days
have
come
though
is
there
not
a
glorious
hope
in
autumn
but
where
is
the
definite
expression
of
against
of
happiness
against
optimism
a
painter
paints
a
sunset
can
he
paint
the
setting
sun
in
some
century
to
come
when
the
school
children
will
whistle
popular
tunes
in
when
the
diatonic
scale
will
be
as
obsolete
as
the
pentatonic
is
now
perhaps
then
these
borderland
experiences
may
be
both
easily
expressed
and
readily
recognized
but
maybe
music
was
not
intended
to
satisfy
the
curious
definiteness
of
man
maybe
it
is
better
to
hope
that
music
may
always
be
a
transcendental
language
in
the
most
extravagant
sense
possibly
the
power
of
literally
distinguishing
these
shades
of
abstraction
these
attributes
paralleled
by
artistic
intuitions
call
them
what
you
will
ever
to
be
denied
man
for
the
same
reason
that
the
beginning
and
end
of
a
circle
are
to
be
denied
there
may
be
an
analogy
and
on
first
sight
it
seems
that
there
must
be
between
both
the
state
and
power
of
artistic
perceptions
and
the
law
of
perpetual
change
that
stream
partly
biological
partly
cosmic
ever
going
on
in
ourselves
in
nature
in
all
life
this
may
account
for
the
difficulty
of
identifying
desired
qualities
with
the
perceptions
of
them
in
expression
many
things
are
constantly
coming
into
being
while
others
are
constantly
going
out
one
part
of
the
same
thing
is
coming
in
while
another
part
is
going
out
of
existence
perhaps
this
is
why
the
above
conformity
in
art
a
conformity
which
we
seem
naturally
to
look
for
appears
at
times
so
unrealizable
if
not
impossible
it
will
be
assumed
to
make
this
theory
clearer
that
the
flow
or
change
does
not
go
on
in
the
itself
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
probably
does
to
a
certain
extent
a
picture
or
a
song
may
gain
or
lose
in
value
beyond
what
the
painter
or
composer
knew
by
the
progress
and
higher
development
in
all
art
keats
may
be
only
partially
true
when
he
says
that
a
work
of
beauty
is
a
joy
forever
a
thing
that
is
beautiful
to
me
is
a
joy
to
me
as
long
as
it
remains
beautiful
to
me
and
if
it
remains
so
as
long
as
i
live
it
is
so
forever
that
is
forever
to
me
if
he
had
put
it
this
way
he
would
have
been
tiresome
inartistic
but
perhaps
truer
so
we
will
assume
here
that
this
change
only
goes
on
in
man
and
nature
and
that
this
eternal
process
in
mankind
is
paralleled
in
some
way
during
each
temporary
personal
life
a
young
man
two
generations
ago
found
an
identity
with
his
ideals
in
rossini
when
an
older
man
in
wagner
a
young
man
one
generation
ago
found
his
in
wagner
but
when
older
in
cesar
franck
or
brahms
some
may
say
that
this
change
may
not
be
general
universal
or
natural
and
that
it
may
be
due
to
a
certain
kind
of
education
or
to
a
certain
inherited
or
contracted
prejudice
we
can
not
deny
or
affirm
this
absolutely
nor
will
we
try
to
even
qualitatively
except
to
say
that
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
rossini
today
does
not
appeal
to
this
generation
as
he
did
to
that
of
our
fathers
as
far
as
prejudice
or
undue
influence
is
concerned
and
as
an
illustration
in
point
the
following
may
be
cited
to
show
that
training
may
have
but
little
effect
in
this
connection
at
least
not
as
much
as
usually
supposed
for
we
believe
this
experience
to
be
to
a
certain
extent
normal
or
at
least
not
uncommon
a
man
remembers
when
he
was
a
boy
of
about
fifteen
years
hearing
his
and
father
who
had
just
returned
from
a
performance
of
siegfried
say
with
a
look
of
anxious
surprise
that
somehow
or
other
he
felt
ashamed
of
enjoying
the
music
as
he
did
for
beneath
it
all
he
was
conscious
of
an
undercurrent
of
the
bravery
was
the
love
was
the
passion
the
virtue
all
as
was
the
dragon
barnum
would
have
been
brave
enough
to
have
gone
out
and
captured
a
live
one
but
that
same
boy
at
was
listening
to
wagner
with
enthusiasm
his
reality
was
real
enough
to
inspire
a
devotion
the
for
instance
stirred
him
deeply
but
when
he
became
and
long
before
the
hohenzollern
into
belgium
this
music
had
become
cloying
the
melodies
threadbare
a
sense
of
something
commonplace
yes
of
came
these
feelings
were
fought
against
for
association
sake
and
because
of
gratitude
for
bygone
pleasures
but
the
former
beauty
and
nobility
were
not
there
and
in
their
place
stood
irritating
intervals
of
descending
fourths
and
fifths
those
once
transcendent
progressions
luxuriant
suggestions
of
debussy
chords
of
the
were
becoming
slimy
an
unearned
exultation
a
sentimentality
deadening
something
within
hides
around
in
the
music
wagner
seems
less
and
less
to
measure
up
to
the
substance
and
reality
of
cesar
franck
brahms
or
even
elgar
with
all
his
tiresomeness
the
wholesomeness
manliness
humility
and
deep
spiritual
possibly
religious
feeling
of
these
men
seem
missing
and
not
made
up
for
by
his
wagner
manner
and
eloquence
even
if
greater
than
theirs
which
is
very
doubtful
from
the
above
we
would
try
to
prove
that
as
this
stream
of
change
flows
towards
the
eventual
ocean
of
mankind
perfection
the
in
which
we
identify
our
higher
ideals
come
by
this
process
to
be
identified
with
the
lower
ideals
of
those
who
embark
after
us
when
the
stream
has
grown
in
depth
if
we
stop
with
the
above
experience
our
theory
of
the
effect
of
man
changing
nature
as
thus
explaining
artistic
progress
is
perhaps
sustained
thus
would
we
show
that
the
perpetual
flow
of
the
life
stream
is
affected
by
and
affects
each
individual
riverbed
of
the
universal
watersheds
thus
would
we
prove
that
the
wagner
period
was
normal
because
we
intuitively
recognized
whatever
identity
we
were
looking
for
at
a
certain
period
in
our
life
and
the
fact
that
it
was
so
made
the
franck
period
possible
and
then
normal
at
a
later
period
in
our
life
thus
would
we
assume
that
this
is
as
it
should
be
and
that
it
is
not
wagner
content
or
substance
or
his
lack
of
virtue
that
something
in
us
has
made
us
flow
past
him
and
not
he
past
us
but
something
blocks
our
theory
something
makes
our
hypotheses
seem
purely
speculative
if
not
useless
it
is
men
like
bach
and
beethoven
is
it
not
a
matter
nowadays
of
common
impression
or
general
opinion
for
the
law
of
averages
plays
strongly
in
any
theory
relating
to
human
attributes
that
the
world
attitude
towards
the
substance
and
quality
and
spirit
of
these
two
men
or
other
men
of
like
character
if
there
be
such
has
not
been
affected
by
the
flowing
stream
that
has
changed
us
but
if
by
the
measure
of
this
public
opinion
as
well
as
it
can
be
measured
bach
and
beethoven
are
being
flowed
past
not
as
fast
perhaps
as
wagner
is
but
if
they
are
being
passed
at
all
from
this
deeper
viewpoint
then
this
change
theory
holds
here
we
shall
have
to
assume
for
we
have
proved
it
that
artistic
intuitions
can
sense
in
music
a
weakening
of
moral
strength
and
vitality
and
that
it
is
sensed
in
relation
to
wagner
and
not
sensed
in
relation
to
bach
and
beethoven
if
in
this
common
opinion
there
is
a
particle
of
change
toward
the
latter
art
our
theory
stands
mind
you
this
admits
a
change
in
the
manner
form
external
expression
but
not
in
substance
if
there
is
no
change
here
towards
the
substance
of
these
two
men
our
theory
not
only
falls
but
its
failure
superimposes
or
allows
us
to
presume
a
fundamental
duality
in
music
and
in
all
art
for
that
matter
does
the
progress
of
intrinsic
beauty
or
truth
we
assume
there
is
such
a
thing
have
its
exposures
as
well
as
its
discoveries
does
the
of
the
foregoing
theory
mean
that
wagner
substance
and
reality
are
lower
and
his
manner
higher
that
his
beauty
was
not
intrinsic
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
repose
of
pride
than
in
the
truth
of
humility
it
appears
that
he
chose
the
representative
instead
of
the
spirit
itself
that
he
chose
consciously
or
unconsciously
it
matters
not
the
lower
set
of
values
in
this
dualism
these
are
severe
accusations
to
bring
especially
when
a
man
is
a
little
down
as
wagner
is
today
but
these
convictions
were
present
some
time
before
he
was
banished
from
the
metropolitan
wagner
seems
to
take
hugo
place
in
faguet
criticism
of
de
vigny
that
the
staging
to
him
hugo
was
the
important
thing
not
the
conception
that
in
de
vigny
the
artist
was
inferior
to
the
poet
finally
that
hugo
and
so
wagner
have
a
certain
pauvrete
de
fond
thus
would
we
ungenerously
make
wagner
prove
our
sum
but
it
is
a
sum
that
wo
prove
the
theory
at
its
best
does
little
more
than
suggest
something
which
if
it
is
true
at
all
is
a
platitude
viz
that
progressive
growth
in
all
life
makes
it
more
and
more
possible
for
men
to
separate
in
an
moral
weakness
from
artistic
strength
human
attributes
are
definite
enough
when
it
comes
to
their
description
but
the
expression
of
them
or
the
paralleling
of
them
in
an
has
to
be
as
said
above
more
or
less
arbitrary
but
we
believe
that
their
expression
can
be
less
vague
if
the
basic
distinction
of
this
is
kept
in
mind
it
is
morally
certain
that
the
higher
part
is
founded
as
sturt
suggests
on
something
that
has
to
do
with
those
kinds
of
unselfish
human
interests
which
we
call
knowledge
and
morality
knowledge
not
in
the
sense
of
erudition
but
as
a
kind
of
creation
or
creative
truth
this
allows
us
to
assume
that
the
higher
and
more
important
value
of
this
dualism
is
composed
of
what
may
be
called
reality
quality
spirit
or
substance
against
the
lower
value
of
form
quantity
or
manner
of
these
terms
substance
seems
to
us
the
most
appropriate
cogent
and
comprehensive
for
the
higher
and
manner
for
the
substance
in
a
suggests
the
body
of
a
conviction
which
has
its
birth
in
the
spiritual
consciousness
whose
youth
is
nourished
in
the
moral
consciousness
and
whose
maturity
as
a
result
of
all
this
growth
is
then
represented
in
a
mental
image
this
is
appreciated
by
the
intuition
and
somehow
translated
into
expression
by
manner
a
process
always
less
important
than
it
seems
or
as
suggested
by
the
foregoing
in
fact
we
apologize
for
this
attempted
definition
so
it
seems
that
substance
is
too
indefinite
to
analyze
in
more
specific
terms
it
is
practically
indescribable
intuitions
artistic
or
not
will
sense
it
process
unknown
perhaps
it
is
an
unexplained
consciousness
of
being
nearer
god
or
being
nearer
the
devil
of
approaching
truth
or
approaching
unreality
a
silent
something
felt
in
the
in
turner
against
the
in
botticelli
or
in
the
fine
thinking
of
ruskin
against
the
fine
soundings
of
kipling
or
in
the
wide
expanse
of
titian
against
the
of
carpaccio
or
in
some
such
distinction
that
pope
sees
between
what
he
calls
homer
invention
and
virgil
judgment
apparently
an
inspired
imagination
against
an
artistic
care
a
sense
of
the
difference
perhaps
between
bushnell
knowing
god
and
knowing
about
god
a
more
vivid
explanation
or
illustration
may
be
found
in
the
difference
between
emerson
and
poe
the
former
seems
to
be
almost
wholly
substance
and
the
latter
manner
the
measure
in
artistic
satisfaction
of
poe
manner
is
equal
to
the
measure
of
spiritual
satisfaction
in
emerson
substance
the
total
value
of
each
man
is
high
but
emerson
is
higher
than
because
substance
is
higher
than
manner
because
substance
leans
towards
optimism
and
manner
pessimism
we
do
not
know
that
all
this
is
so
but
we
feel
or
rather
know
by
intuition
that
it
is
so
in
the
same
way
we
know
intuitively
that
right
is
higher
than
wrong
though
we
ca
always
tell
why
a
thing
is
right
or
wrong
or
what
is
always
the
difference
or
the
margin
between
right
and
wrong
beauty
in
its
common
conception
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
substance
unless
it
be
granted
that
its
outward
aspect
or
the
expression
between
sensuous
beauty
and
spiritual
beauty
can
be
always
and
distinctly
known
which
it
can
not
as
the
art
of
music
is
still
in
its
infancy
on
reading
this
over
it
seems
only
decent
that
some
kind
of
an
apology
be
made
for
the
beginning
of
the
preceding
sentence
it
can
not
justly
be
said
that
anything
that
has
to
do
with
art
has
nothing
to
do
with
beauty
in
any
degree
that
is
whether
beauty
is
there
or
not
it
has
something
to
do
with
it
a
casual
idea
of
it
a
kind
of
a
first
impression
was
what
we
had
in
mind
probably
nobody
knows
what
actual
beauty
is
except
those
serious
writers
of
humorous
essays
in
art
magazines
who
accurately
but
kindly
with
club
in
hand
demonstrate
for
all
time
and
men
that
beauty
is
a
quadratic
monomial
that
it
absolute
that
it
is
relative
that
it
relative
that
it
the
word
beauty
is
as
easy
to
use
as
the
word
degenerate
both
come
in
handy
when
one
does
or
does
not
agree
with
you
for
our
part
something
that
says
comes
nearer
to
what
we
like
to
think
beauty
is
an
infinite
source
of
good
the
love
of
the
beautiful
a
constant
anxiety
for
moral
beauty
even
here
we
go
around
in
a
circle
a
thing
apparently
inevitable
if
one
tries
to
reduce
art
to
philosophy
but
personally
we
prefer
to
go
around
in
a
circle
than
around
in
a
parallelepipedon
for
it
seems
cleaner
and
perhaps
freer
from
mathematics
or
for
the
same
reason
we
prefer
whittier
to
baudelaire
a
poet
to
a
genius
or
a
healthy
to
a
rotten
apple
probably
not
so
much
because
it
is
more
nutritious
but
because
we
like
its
taste
better
we
like
the
beautiful
and
do
like
the
ugly
therefore
what
we
like
is
beautiful
and
what
we
do
like
is
ugly
and
hence
we
are
glad
the
beautiful
is
not
ugly
for
if
it
were
we
would
like
something
we
do
like
so
having
unsettled
what
beauty
is
let
us
go
on
at
any
rate
we
are
going
to
be
arbitrary
enough
to
claim
with
no
definite
qualification
that
substance
can
be
expressed
in
music
and
that
it
is
the
only
valuable
thing
in
it
and
moreover
that
in
two
separate
pieces
of
music
in
which
the
notes
are
almost
identical
one
can
be
of
substance
with
little
manner
and
the
other
can
be
of
manner
with
little
substance
substance
has
something
to
do
with
character
manner
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
substance
of
a
tune
comes
from
somewhere
near
the
soul
and
the
manner
comes
from
god
knows
where
the
lack
of
interest
to
preserve
or
ability
to
perceive
the
fundamental
divisions
of
this
duality
accounts
to
a
large
extent
we
believe
for
some
or
many
various
phenomena
pleasant
or
unpleasant
according
to
the
personal
attitude
of
modern
art
and
all
art
it
is
evidenced
in
many
ways
the
sculptors
on
the
mold
the
outer
rather
than
the
inner
subject
or
content
of
his
statue
for
local
color
in
the
multiplicity
of
techniques
in
the
idiomatic
in
the
effect
as
shown
by
the
appreciation
of
an
audience
rather
than
in
the
effect
on
the
ideals
of
the
inner
conscience
of
the
artist
or
the
composer
this
lack
of
perceiving
is
too
often
shown
by
an
in
the
material
value
of
the
effect
the
pose
of
which
some
men
in
the
advertising
business
and
incidentally
in
the
recital
and
composing
business
put
into
their
photographs
or
the
portraits
of
themselves
while
all
dolled
up
in
their
in
their
twofold
wealth
of
golden
hair
in
their
postures
over
the
piano
keys
this
pose
of
manner
sometimes
sounds
out
so
loud
that
the
more
their
music
is
played
the
less
it
is
heard
for
does
not
emerson
tell
them
this
when
he
says
what
you
are
talks
so
loud
that
i
can
not
hear
what
you
say
the
unescapable
impression
that
one
sometimes
gets
by
a
glance
at
these
and
without
having
heard
or
seen
any
of
their
music
is
that
the
one
great
underlying
desire
of
these
is
to
impress
perhaps
startle
and
shock
their
audiences
and
at
any
cost
this
may
have
some
such
effect
upon
some
of
the
male
or
female
of
their
listeners
but
possibly
the
members
of
the
who
as
boys
liked
hockey
better
than
may
feel
like
shocking
a
few
of
these
with
something
stronger
than
their
own
forzandos
the
insistence
upon
manner
in
its
relation
to
local
color
is
wider
than
a
for
effect
if
local
color
is
a
natural
part
that
is
a
part
of
substance
the
can
not
help
but
show
its
color
and
it
will
be
a
true
color
no
matter
how
colored
if
it
is
a
part
even
a
natural
part
of
manner
either
the
color
part
is
bound
eventually
to
drive
out
the
local
part
or
the
local
drive
out
all
color
here
a
process
of
cancellation
or
destruction
is
going
on
a
kind
of
compromise
which
destroys
by
deadlock
a
compromise
purchasing
a
selfish
pleasure
a
decadence
in
which
art
becomes
first
dull
then
dark
then
dead
though
throughout
this
process
it
is
outwardly
very
much
alive
especially
after
it
is
dead
the
same
tendency
may
even
be
noticed
if
there
is
upon
the
national
in
art
substance
tends
to
create
affection
manner
prejudice
the
latter
tends
to
efface
the
distinction
between
the
love
of
both
a
country
virtue
and
vices
and
the
love
of
only
the
virtue
a
true
love
of
country
is
likely
to
be
so
big
that
it
will
embrace
the
virtue
one
sees
in
other
countries
and
in
the
same
breath
so
to
speak
a
composer
born
in
america
but
who
has
not
been
interested
in
the
cause
of
the
freedmen
may
be
so
interested
in
negro
melodies
that
he
writes
a
symphony
over
them
he
is
conscious
perhaps
only
subconscious
that
he
wishes
it
to
be
american
music
he
tries
to
forget
that
the
paternal
negro
came
from
africa
is
his
music
american
or
african
that
is
the
great
question
which
keeps
him
awake
but
the
sadness
of
it
is
that
if
he
had
been
born
in
africa
his
music
might
have
been
just
as
american
for
there
is
good
authority
that
an
african
soul
under
an
looks
identically
like
an
american
soul
there
is
a
futility
in
selecting
a
certain
type
to
represent
a
whole
unless
the
interest
in
the
spirit
of
the
type
coincides
with
that
of
the
whole
in
other
words
if
this
composer
is
as
deeply
interested
in
the
cause
as
wendell
phillips
was
when
he
fought
his
way
through
that
crowd
at
faneuil
hall
his
music
is
liable
to
be
less
american
than
he
wishes
if
a
man
upon
picking
up
the
scottish
chiefs
finds
that
his
boyhood
enthusiasm
for
the
prowess
and
noble
deeds
and
character
of
sir
wm
wallace
and
of
bruce
is
still
present
let
him
put
or
try
to
put
that
glory
into
an
overture
let
him
fill
it
of
scotch
tunes
if
he
will
but
after
all
is
said
and
sung
he
will
find
that
his
music
is
american
to
the
core
assuming
that
he
is
an
american
and
wishes
his
music
to
be
it
will
be
as
national
in
character
as
the
heart
of
that
grand
army
grandfather
who
read
those
cragmore
tales
of
a
summer
evening
when
that
boy
had
brought
the
cows
home
without
witching
perhaps
the
memories
of
the
old
soldier
to
which
this
man
still
holds
tenderly
may
be
turned
into
a
strain
or
a
sonata
and
though
the
music
does
not
contain
or
even
suggest
any
of
the
old
it
will
be
as
sincerely
american
as
the
subject
provided
his
the
composer
interest
spirit
and
character
sympathize
with
or
intuitively
coincide
with
that
of
the
subject
again
if
a
man
finds
that
the
cadences
of
an
apache
come
nearest
to
his
soul
provided
he
has
taken
pains
to
know
enough
other
cadences
for
eclecticism
is
part
of
his
duty
sorting
potatoes
means
a
better
crop
next
year
let
him
assimilate
whatever
he
finds
highest
of
the
indian
ideal
so
that
he
can
use
it
with
the
cadences
fervently
transcendentally
inevitably
furiously
in
his
symphonies
in
his
operas
in
his
whistlings
on
the
way
to
work
so
that
he
can
paint
his
house
with
them
make
them
a
part
of
his
this
is
all
possible
and
necessary
if
he
is
confident
that
they
have
a
part
in
his
spiritual
consciousness
with
this
assurance
his
music
will
have
everything
it
should
of
sincerity
nobility
strength
and
beauty
no
matter
how
it
sounds
and
if
with
this
he
is
true
to
none
but
the
highest
of
american
ideals
that
is
the
ideals
only
that
coincide
with
his
spiritual
consciousness
his
music
will
be
true
to
itself
and
incidentally
american
and
it
will
be
so
even
after
it
is
proved
that
all
our
indians
came
from
asia
the
man
born
down
to
babbitt
corners
may
find
a
deep
appeal
in
the
simple
but
acute
gospel
hymns
of
the
new
england
camp
meetin
of
a
generation
or
so
ago
he
finds
in
them
some
of
them
a
vigor
a
depth
of
feeling
a
rhythm
a
sincerity
emphatic
but
inartistic
which
in
spite
of
a
vociferous
sentimentality
carries
him
nearer
the
christ
of
the
people
than
does
the
te
deum
of
the
greatest
cathedral
these
tunes
have
for
him
a
truer
ring
than
many
of
those
monotonous
academic
english
or
hymns
and
anthems
things
and
well
by
well
corrected
mus
bac
sounds
correct
and
inevitable
to
sight
and
hearing
in
a
word
those
proper
forms
of
beauty
which
our
are
limited
to
but
if
the
yankee
can
reflect
the
fervency
with
which
his
gospels
were
sung
the
fervency
of
aunt
sarah
who
scrubbed
her
life
away
for
her
brother
ten
orphans
the
fervency
with
which
this
woman
after
a
work
day
on
the
farm
would
hitch
up
and
drive
five
miles
through
the
mud
and
rain
to
prayer
meetin
her
one
articulate
outlet
for
the
fullness
of
her
unselfish
soul
if
he
can
reflect
the
fervency
of
such
a
spirit
he
may
find
there
a
local
color
that
will
do
all
the
world
good
if
his
music
can
but
catch
that
spirit
by
being
a
part
with
itself
it
will
come
somewhere
near
his
ideal
and
it
will
be
american
too
perhaps
nearer
so
than
that
of
the
devotee
of
indian
or
negro
melody
in
other
words
if
local
color
national
color
any
color
is
a
true
pigment
of
the
universal
color
it
is
a
divine
quality
it
is
a
part
of
substance
in
art
not
of
manner
the
preceding
illustrations
are
but
attempts
to
show
that
whatever
excellence
an
artist
sees
in
life
a
community
in
a
people
or
in
any
valuable
object
or
experience
if
sincerely
and
intuitively
reflected
in
his
work
and
so
he
himself
is
in
a
way
a
reflected
part
of
that
excellence
whether
he
be
accepted
or
rejected
whether
his
music
is
always
played
or
never
played
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
is
true
or
false
by
his
own
measure
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
leave
out
two
words
and
add
a
few
more
a
sentence
of
hegel
appears
to
sum
up
this
idea
the
universal
need
for
expression
in
art
lies
in
rational
impulse
to
exalt
the
inner
world
the
highest
ideals
he
sees
in
the
inner
life
of
others
together
with
what
he
finds
in
his
own
life
into
a
spiritual
consciousness
for
himself
the
artist
does
feel
or
does
not
feel
that
a
sympathy
has
been
approved
by
an
artistic
intuition
and
so
reflected
in
his
work
whether
he
feels
this
sympathy
is
true
or
not
in
the
final
analysis
is
a
thing
probably
that
no
one
but
he
the
artist
knows
but
the
truer
he
feels
it
the
more
substance
it
has
or
as
sturt
puts
it
his
work
is
art
so
long
as
he
feels
in
doing
it
as
true
artists
feel
and
so
long
as
his
object
is
akin
to
the
objects
that
true
artists
admire
griggs
in
an
essay
on
debussy
john
griggs
debussy
yale
review
asks
if
this
composer
content
is
worthy
the
manner
perhaps
so
perhaps
not
debussy
himself
doubtless
could
not
give
a
positive
answer
he
would
better
know
how
true
his
feeling
and
sympathy
was
and
anyone
else
personal
opinion
can
be
of
but
little
help
here
we
might
offer
the
suggestion
that
debussy
content
would
have
been
worthier
his
manner
if
he
had
hoed
corn
or
sold
newspapers
for
a
living
for
in
this
way
he
might
have
gained
a
deeper
vitality
and
truer
theme
to
sing
at
night
and
of
a
sunday
or
we
might
say
that
what
substance
there
is
is
too
coherent
it
is
too
clearly
expressed
in
the
first
thirty
seconds
there
you
have
the
whole
fragment
a
translucent
syllogism
but
then
the
reality
the
spirit
the
substance
stops
and
the
form
the
perfume
the
manner
shimmer
right
along
as
the
soapsuds
glisten
after
one
has
finished
washing
or
we
might
say
that
his
substance
would
have
been
worthier
if
his
adoration
or
contemplation
of
nature
which
is
often
a
part
of
it
and
which
rises
to
great
heights
as
is
felt
for
example
in
la
mer
had
been
more
the
quality
of
thoreau
debussy
attitude
toward
nature
seems
to
have
a
kind
of
sensual
sensuousness
underlying
it
while
thoreau
is
a
kind
of
spiritual
sensuousness
it
is
rare
to
find
a
farmer
or
peasant
whose
enthusiasm
for
the
beauty
in
nature
finds
outward
expression
to
compare
with
that
of
the
who
comes
out
for
a
sunday
in
the
country
but
thoreau
is
that
rare
and
debussy
the
with
his
weekend
flights
into
we
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
thoreau
leaned
towards
substance
and
debussy
towards
manner
there
comes
from
concord
an
offer
to
every
mind
the
choice
between
repose
and
truth
and
god
makes
the
offer
take
which
you
please
between
these
as
a
pendulum
man
oscillates
he
in
whom
the
love
of
repose
predominates
will
accept
the
first
creed
the
first
philosophy
the
first
political
party
he
meets
most
likely
his
father
he
gets
rest
commodity
and
reputation
here
is
another
aspect
of
but
it
is
more
drastic
than
ours
as
it
would
eliminate
one
part
or
the
other
a
man
may
aim
as
high
as
beethoven
or
as
high
as
richard
strauss
in
the
former
case
the
shot
may
go
far
below
the
mark
in
truth
it
has
not
been
reached
since
that
thunder
storm
of
and
there
is
little
chance
that
it
will
be
reached
by
anyone
living
today
but
that
matters
not
the
shot
will
never
rebound
and
destroy
the
marksman
but
in
the
latter
case
the
shot
may
often
hit
the
mark
but
as
often
rebound
and
harden
if
not
destroy
the
shooter
heart
even
his
soul
what
matters
it
men
say
he
will
then
find
rest
commodity
and
reputation
what
matters
it
if
he
find
there
but
few
perfect
truths
what
matters
men
say
he
will
find
there
perfect
media
those
perfect
instruments
of
getting
in
the
way
of
perfect
truths
this
choice
tells
why
beethoven
is
always
modern
and
strauss
always
mediaeval
try
as
he
may
to
cover
it
up
in
new
bottles
he
has
chosen
to
capitalize
a
talent
he
has
chosen
the
complexity
of
media
the
shining
hardness
of
externals
repose
against
the
inner
invisible
activity
of
truth
he
has
chosen
the
first
creed
the
easy
creed
the
philosophy
of
his
fathers
among
whom
he
found
a
nietzsche
his
choice
naturally
leads
him
to
glorify
and
to
magnify
all
kind
of
dull
things
geigermusik
which
in
turn
naturally
leads
him
to
windmills
and
human
heads
on
silver
platters
magnifying
the
dull
into
the
colossal
produces
a
kind
of
comfort
the
comfort
of
a
woman
who
takes
more
pleasure
in
the
fit
of
fashionable
clothes
than
in
a
healthy
body
the
kind
of
comfort
that
has
brought
so
many
adventures
of
at
county
fairs
the
sensation
of
teddy
bears
smoking
their
first
cigarette
on
the
program
of
symphony
orchestras
of
one
hundred
performers
the
lure
of
the
media
the
means
not
the
end
but
the
finish
thus
the
failure
to
perceive
that
thoughts
and
memories
of
childhood
are
too
tender
and
some
of
them
too
sacred
to
be
worn
lightly
on
the
sleeve
life
is
too
short
for
these
one
hundred
men
to
say
nothing
of
the
composer
and
the
to
spend
an
afternoon
in
this
way
they
are
but
like
the
rest
of
us
and
have
only
the
expectancy
of
the
to
survive
perhaps
only
this
piece
we
can
not
but
feel
that
a
too
great
desire
for
repose
accounts
for
such
phenomena
a
score
is
brought
to
a
concertmaster
he
may
be
a
violinist
he
is
kindly
disposed
he
looks
it
over
and
casually
fastens
on
a
passage
that
bad
for
the
fiddles
it
does
hang
just
right
write
it
like
this
they
will
play
it
better
but
that
one
phrase
is
the
germ
of
the
whole
thing
never
mind
it
will
fit
the
hand
better
this
way
it
will
sound
better
my
god
what
has
sound
got
to
do
with
music
the
waiter
brings
the
only
fresh
egg
he
has
but
the
man
at
breakfast
sends
it
back
because
it
does
fit
his
eggcup
why
ca
music
go
out
in
the
same
way
it
comes
in
to
a
man
without
having
to
crawl
over
a
fence
of
sounds
thoraxes
catguts
wire
wood
and
brass
are
as
harmless
as
blue
laws
compared
with
the
relentless
tyranny
of
the
media
the
instrument
there
is
the
perennial
difficulty
there
is
limitations
why
must
the
scarecrow
of
the
keyboard
the
tyrant
in
terms
of
the
mechanism
be
it
caruso
or
a
stare
into
every
measure
is
it
the
composer
fault
that
man
has
only
ten
fingers
why
ca
a
musical
thought
be
presented
as
it
is
born
perchance
a
bastard
of
the
slums
or
a
daughter
of
a
bishop
and
if
it
happens
to
go
better
later
on
a
than
upon
a
harp
get
a
good
footnote
the
first
movement
emerson
of
the
music
which
is
the
cause
of
all
these
words
was
first
thought
of
we
believe
in
terms
of
a
large
orchestra
the
second
hawthorne
in
terms
of
a
piano
or
a
dozen
pianos
the
third
alcotts
of
an
organ
or
piano
with
voice
or
violin
and
the
last
thoreau
in
terms
of
strings
colored
possibly
with
a
flute
or
horn
that
music
must
be
heard
is
not
essential
what
it
sounds
like
may
not
be
what
it
is
perhaps
the
day
is
coming
when
music
believers
will
learn
that
silence
is
a
solvent
that
gives
us
leave
to
be
universal
rather
than
personal
some
fiddler
was
once
honest
or
brave
enough
or
perhaps
ignorant
enough
to
say
that
beethoven
did
know
how
to
write
for
the
violin
that
maybe
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
beethoven
is
not
a
vieuxtemps
another
man
says
beethoven
piano
sonatas
are
not
pianistic
with
a
little
effort
perhaps
beethoven
could
have
become
a
thalberg
his
symphonies
are
and
perfect
for
the
orchestra
of
but
mahler
could
have
made
them
possibly
did
make
them
we
will
say
more
perfect
as
far
as
their
media
clothes
are
concerned
and
beethoven
is
today
big
enough
to
rather
like
it
he
is
probably
in
the
same
amiable
state
of
mind
that
the
jesuit
priest
said
god
was
in
when
he
looked
down
on
the
camp
ground
and
saw
the
priest
sleeping
with
a
congregational
chaplain
or
in
the
same
state
of
mind
you
be
in
when
you
look
down
and
see
the
sexton
keeping
your
tombstone
up
to
date
the
truth
of
joachim
offsets
the
repose
of
paganini
and
kubelik
the
repose
and
reputation
of
a
successful
pianist
whatever
that
means
who
plays
chopin
so
cleverly
that
he
covers
up
a
sensuality
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
see
nothing
but
sensuous
beauty
in
it
which
by
the
way
does
disturb
him
as
much
as
the
size
of
his
the
repose
and
fame
of
this
man
is
offset
by
the
truth
and
obscurity
of
the
village
organist
who
plays
lowell
mason
and
bach
with
such
affection
that
he
would
give
his
life
rather
than
lose
them
the
truth
and
courage
of
this
organist
who
risks
his
job
to
fight
the
prejudice
of
the
congregation
offset
the
repose
and
large
salary
of
a
more
celebrated
choirmaster
who
holds
his
job
by
lowering
his
ideals
who
is
willing
to
let
the
organ
smirk
under
an
insipid
barcarolle
for
the
offertory
who
is
willing
to
please
the
sentimental
ears
of
the
music
committee
and
its
wives
who
is
more
willing
to
observe
these
forms
of
politeness
than
to
stand
up
for
a
stronger
and
deeper
music
of
simple
devotion
and
for
a
service
of
a
spiritual
unity
the
kind
of
thing
that
bossitt
who
owns
the
biggest
country
place
the
biggest
bank
and
the
biggest
house
of
god
in
town
for
is
it
not
the
divine
handiwork
of
his
the
kind
of
music
that
this
man
his
wife
and
his
party
of
property
right
in
pews
ca
stand
because
it
is
pretty
the
doctrine
of
this
choice
may
be
extended
to
the
distinction
between
and
right
or
wrong
notes
good
or
bad
tones
against
good
or
bad
interpretation
good
or
bad
sentiment
or
between
observation
and
introspection
or
to
the
distinction
between
remembering
and
dreaming
strauss
remembers
beethoven
dreams
we
see
this
distinction
also
in
goethe
confusion
of
the
moral
with
the
intellectual
there
is
no
such
confusion
in
beethoven
to
him
they
are
one
it
is
told
and
the
story
is
so
well
known
that
we
hesitate
to
repeat
it
here
that
both
these
men
were
standing
in
the
street
one
day
when
the
emperor
drove
by
goethe
like
the
rest
of
the
crowd
bowed
and
uncovered
but
beethoven
stood
bolt
upright
and
refused
even
to
salute
saying
let
him
bow
to
us
for
ours
is
a
nobler
empire
goethe
mind
knew
this
was
true
but
his
moral
courage
was
not
instinctive
this
remembering
faculty
of
repose
throws
the
mind
in
unguarded
moments
quite
naturally
towards
manner
and
thus
to
the
many
things
the
media
can
do
it
brings
on
an
itching
to
them
to
be
original
if
anyone
will
tell
what
that
is
with
nothing
but
numbers
to
be
original
with
we
are
told
that
a
conductor
of
the
orchestra
has
written
a
symphony
requiring
an
orchestra
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
if
his
work
perhaps
had
one
hundred
and
fifty
valuable
ideas
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
might
be
justifiable
but
as
it
probably
contains
not
more
than
a
dozen
the
composer
may
be
unconsciously
ashamed
of
them
and
glad
to
cover
them
up
under
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
a
man
may
become
famous
because
he
is
able
to
eat
nineteen
dinners
a
day
but
posterity
will
decorate
his

breeds
a
only
to
be
clever
a
satellite
of
and
perhaps
to
be
witty
in
the
bargain
not
the
wit
in
but
a
kind
of
indoor
artificial
mental
arrangement
of
things
quickly
put
together
and
which
have
been
learned
and
studied
it
is
of
the

and
stays
there
while

is
of
the
emotional
and
of
the
approaching
spiritual
even
dukas
and
perhaps
other
gauls
in
their
critical
heart
of
hearts
may
admit
that
wit
in
music
is
as
impossible
as
wit
at
a
funeral
the
wit
is
evidence
of
its
lack
mark
twain
could
be
humorous
at
the
death
of
his
dearest
friend
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
put
a
blessing
into
the
heart
of
the
bereaved
humor
in
music
has
the
same
possibilities
but
its
quantity
has
a
serious
effect
on
its
quality
inverse
ratio
is
a
good
formula
to
adopt
here
comedy
has
its
part
but
wit
never
strauss
is
at
his
best
in
these
lower
rooms
but
his
comedy
reminds
us
more
of
the
physical
fun
of
lever
rather
than
comedy
in
the
meredithian
sense
as
mason
suggests
meredith
is
a
little
too
deep
or
too
subtle
for
strauss
unless
it
be
granted
that
cynicism
is
more
a
part
of
comedy
than
a
part
of
let
us
also
remember
that
disston
not
strauss
put
the
funny
notes
in
the
bassoon
a
symphony
written
only
to
amuse
and
entertain
is
likely
to
amuse
only
the
writer
and
him
not
long
after
the
check
is
cashed
genius
is
always
ascetic
and
piety
and
love
thus
emerson
reinforces
god
offer
of
this
choice
by
a
transcendental
definition
the
moment
a
famous
violinist
refused
to
appear
until
he
had
received
his
check
at
that
moment
precisely
assuming
for
argument
sake
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
materialism
had
the
ascendancy
in
this
man
soul
at
that
moment
he
became
but
a
man
of
talent
incidentally
a
small
man
and
a
small
violinist
regardless
of
how
perfectly
he
played
regardless
to
what
heights
of
emotion
he
stirred
his
audience
regardless
of
the
sublimity
of
his
artistic
and
financial
success
it
is
told
becoming
somewhat
discouraged
at
the
result
of
some
of
his
fiume
adventures
said
we
are
the
only
idealists
left
this
remark
may
have
been
made
in
a
moment
of
careless
impulse
but
if
it
is
taken
at
its
face
value
the
moment
it
was
made
that
moment
his
idealism
started
downhill
a
grasp
at
monopoly
indicates
that
a
sudden
shift
has
taken
place
from
the
heights
where
genius
may
be
found
to
the
lower
plains
of
talent
the
mind
of
a
true
idealist
is
great
enough
to
know
that
a
monopoly
of
idealism
or
of
wheat
is
a
thing
nature
does
not
support
a
newspaper
music
column
prints
an
incident
so
how
can
we
assume
that
it
is
not
true
of
an
american
violinist
who
called
on
max
reger
to
tell
him
how
much
he
the
american
appreciated
his
music
reger
gives
him
a
hopeless
look
and
cries
what
a
musician
and
not
speak
german
at
that
moment
by
the
clock
regardless
of
how
great
a
genius
he
may
have
been
before
that
sentence
was
uttered
at
that
moment
he
became
but
a
man
of
talent
for
the
man
of
talent
affects
to
call
his
transgressions
of
the
laws
of
sense
trivial
and
to
count
them
nothing
considered
with
his
devotion
to
his
art
his
art
never
taught
him
prejudice
or
to
wear
only
one
eye
his
art
is
less
for
every
deduction
from
his
holiness
and
less
for
every
defect
of
common
sense
and
this
common
sense
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
this
distinguishing
difference
of
emerson
between
genius
and
talent
repose
and
truth
and
between
all
evidences
of
substance
and
manner
in
art
manner
breeds
partialists
is
america
a
musical
nation
if
the
man
who
is
ever
asking
this
question
would
sit
down
and
think
something
over
he
might
find
less
interest
in
asking
it
he
might
possibly
remember
that
all
nations
are
more
musical
than
any
nation
especially
the
nation
that
pays
the
most
and
pays
the
most
eagerly
for
anything
after
it
has
been
stamped
music
may
be
yet
unborn
perhaps
no
music
has
ever
been
written
or
heard
perhaps
the
birth
of
art
will
take
place
at
the
moment
in
which
the
last
man
who
is
willing
to
make
a
living
out
of
art
is
gone
and
gone
forever
in
the
history
of
this
youthful
world
the
best
product
that
can
boast
of
is
probably
beethoven
but
maybe
even
his
art
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
future
product
of
some
soul
in
the
century
and
the
same
man
who
is
ever
asking
about
the
most
musical
nation
is
ever
discovering
the
most
musical
man
of
the
most
musical
nation
when
particularly
hysterical
he
shouts
i
have
found
him
smith
grabholz
the
one
great
american
poet
at
last
here
is
the
moses
the
country
has
been
waiting
for
of
course
we
all
know
that
the
country
has
not
been
waiting
for
anybody
and
we
have
many
moses
always
with
us
but
the
discoverer
keeps
right
on
shouting
here
is
the
one
true
american
poetry
i
pronounce
it
the
work
of
a
genius
i
predict
for
him
the
most
brilliant
career
for
his
is
an
art
that
for
his
is
a
soul
that
for
his
is
a
and
grabholz
is
ruined
but
ruined
not
alone
by
this
perennial
discoverer
of
pearls
in
any
that
treats
him
the
best
but
ruined
by
his
own
grabholz
talent
for
genius
will
never
let
itself
be
discovered
by
a
man
then
the
world
may
ask
can
the
one
true
national
this
or
that
be
killed
by
its
own
discoverer
no
the
country
replies
but
each
discovery
is
proof
of
another
impossibility
it
is
a
sad
fact
that
the
one
true
man
and
the
one
true
art
will
never
behave
as
they
should
except
in
the
mind
of
the
partialist
whom
god
has
forgotten
but
this
matters
little
to
him
the
man
his
business
is
good
for
it
is
easy
to
sell
the
future
in
terms
of
the
past
and
there
are
always
some
who
will
buy
anything
the
individual
usually
gains
if
he
is
willing
to
but
lean
on
manner
the
evidence
of
this
is
quite
widespread
for
if
the
discoverer
happens
to
be
in
any
other
line
of
business
his
sudden
discoveries
would
be
just
as
important
to
him
in
fact
the
theory
of
substance
and
manner
in
art
and
its
related
dualisms
repose
and
truth
genius
and
talent
may
find
illustration
in
many
perhaps
most
of
the
human
activities
and
when
examined
it
the
illustration
is
quite
likely
to
show
how
manner
is
always
discovering
partisans
for
example
enthusiastic
discoveries
of
the
paragon
are
common
in
politics
an
art
to
some
these
revelations
in
this
profession
are
made
easy
by
the
of
the
people
and
the
genius
who
is
discovered
forthwith
starts
his
speeches
of
talent
though
they
are
hardly
that
they
are
hardly
more
than
a
string
of
subplatitudes
things
that
almost
everybody
has
seen
known
and
heard
since
rome
or
man
fell
nevertheless
these
signs
of
perfect
manner
these
series
of
noble
sentiments
that
the
noble
never
get
off
are
forcibly
clearly
and
persuasively
handed
out
eloquently
even
beautifully
expressed
and
with
such
personal
charm
magnetism
and
strength
that
their
profound
messages
speed
right
through
the
minds
and
hearts
without
as
much
as
spattering
the
walls
and
land
right
square
in
the
middle
of
the
listener
vanity
for
all
this
is
a
part
of
manner
and
its
quality
is
of
splendor
for
manner
is
at
times
a
good
bluff
but
substance
a
poor
one
and
knows
it
the
discovered
one
usual
and
first
great
outburst
is
probably
the
greatest
truth
that
he
ever
utters
fearlessly
standing
he
looks
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
populace
and
with
a
strong
ringing
voice
for
strong
voices
and
strong
statesmanship
are
inseparable
and
with
words
far
more
eloquent
than
the
following
he
sings
this
honor
is
greater
than
i
deserve
but
duty
calls
me
what
not
stated
if
elected
i
shall
be
your
servant
for
it
is
told
that
he
believes
in
modesty
that
he
has
even
boasted
that
he
is
the
most
modest
man
in
the
country
thus
he
has
the
right
to
shout
first
last
and
forever
i
am
for
the
people
i
am
against
all
bosses
i
have
no
sympathy
for
politicians
i
am
for
strict
economy
liberal
improvements
and
justice
i
am
also
for
the
ten
commandments
his
intuitive
political
sagacity
keeps
him
from
mentioning
any
particular
one
but
a
sublime
height
is
always
reached
in
his
perorations
here
we
learn
that
he
believes
in
honesty
repeat
honesty
we
are
even
allowed
to
infer
that
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
who
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
and
we
also
learn
that
since
he
was
a
little
boy
barefoot
his
motto
has
been
do
right
he
swerves
not
from
the
right
he
believes
in
nothing
but
the
right
to
him
everything
is
right
if
it
gets
him
elected
but
cheers
invariably
stop
this
great
final
truth
in
brackets
from
rising
to
animate
expression
now
all
of
these
translucent
axioms
are
true
are
not
axioms
always
true
as
far
as
manner
is
concerned
in
other
words
the
manner
functions
perfectly
but
where
is
the
divine
substance
this
is
not
there
why
should
it
be
if
it
were
he
might
not
be
there
substance
is
not
featured
in
this
discovery
for
the
truth
of
substance
is
sometimes
silence
sometimes
ellipses
and
the
latter
if
supplied
might
turn
some
of
the
declarations
above
into
perfect
truths
for
instance
first
and
last
and
forever
i
am
for
the
people
votes
i
against
all
bosses
against
me
i
have
no
sympathy
for
rival
politicians
etc
but
these
tedious
attempts
at
comedy
should
stop
too
serious
besides
the
illustration
may
be
a
little
hard
on
a
few
the
minority
the
though
not
on
the
many
the
majority
the
people
but
even
an
assumed
parody
may
help
to
show
what
a
power
manner
is
for
reaction
unless
it
is
counterbalanced
and
then
saturated
by
the
other
part
of
the
duality
thus
it
appears
that
all
there
is
to
this
great
discovery
is
that
one
good
politician
has
discovered
another
good
politician
for
manner
has
brought
forth
its
usual
talent
for
manner
can
not
discover
the
genius
who
has
discarded
platitudes
the
genius
who
has
devised
a
new
and
surpassing
order
for
mankind
simple
and
intricate
enough
abstract
and
definite
enough
locally
impractical
and
universally
practical
enough
to
wipe
out
the
need
for
further
discoveries
of
talent
and
incidentally
the
discoverer
own
fortune
and
political
manner
furthermore
he
this
genius
never
will
be
discovered
until
the
the
the
the
source
of
all
great
values
converts
all
talent
into
genius
all
manner
into
substance
until
the
direct
expression
of
the
mind
and
soul
of
the
majority
the
divine
right
of
all
consciousness
social
moral
and
spiritual
discloses
the
one
true
art
and
thus
finally
discovers
the
one
true
leader
even
itself
then
no
leaders
no
politicians
no
manner
will
hold
sway
and
no
more
speeches
will
be
heard
the
intensity
today
with
which
techniques
and
media
are
organized
and
used
tends
to
throw
the
mind
away
from
a
common
sense
and
towards
manner
and
thus
to
resultant
weak
and
mental
states
for
example
the
byronic
fallacy
that
one
who
is
full
of
turbid
feeling
about
himself
is
qualified
to
be
some
sort
of
an
artist
in
this
relation
manner
also
leads
some
to
think
that
emotional
sympathy
for
self
is
as
true
a
part
of
art
as
sympathy
for
others
and
a
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
good
and
bad
of
one
personality
against
the
virtue
of
many
personalities
it
may
be
that
when
a
poet
or
a
whistler
becomes
conscious
that
he
is
in
the
easy
path
of
any
particular
idiom
that
he
is
helplessly
prejudiced
in
favor
of
any
particular
means
of
expression
that
his
manner
can
be
catalogued
as
modern
or
classic
that
he
favors
a
contrapuntal
groove
a
one
a
sensuous
one
a
successful
one
or
a
melodious
one
whatever
that
means
that
his
interests
lie
in
the
french
school
or
the
german
school
or
the
school
of
saturn
that
he
is
involved
in
this
particular
that
or
that
particular
this
or
in
any
particular
brand
of
emotional
complexes
in
a
word
when
he
becomes
conscious
that
his
style
is
his
personal
own
that
it
has
monopolized
a
geographical
part
of
the
world
sensibilities
then
it
may
be
that
the
value
of
his
substance
is
not
growing
that
it
even
may
have
started
on
its
way
backwards
it
may
be
that
he
is
trading
an
inspiration
for
a
bad
habit
and
finally
that
he
is
reaching
fame
permanence
or
some
other
and
that
he
is
getting
farther
and
farther
from
a
perfect
truth
but
on
the
contrary
side
of
the
picture
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
imagine
that
if
he
this
poet
composer
and
laborer
is
open
to
all
the
overvalues
within
his
reach
if
he
stands
unprotected
from
all
the
showers
of
the
absolute
which
may
beat
upon
him
if
he
is
willing
to
use
or
learn
to
use
or
at
least
if
he
is
not
afraid
of
trying
to
use
whatever
he
can
of
any
and
all
lessons
of
the
infinite
that
humanity
has
received
and
thrown
to
man
that
nature
has
exposed
and
sacrificed
that
life
and
death
have
translated
if
he
accepts
all
and
sympathizes
with
all
is
influenced
by
all
whether
consciously
or
drastically
or
humbly
audibly
or
inaudibly
whether
it
be
all
the
virtue
of
satan
or
the
only
evil
of
heaven
and
all
even
at
one
time
even
in
one
chord
then
it
may
be
that
the
value
of
his
substance
and
its
value
to
himself
to
his
art
to
all
art
even
to
the
common
soul
is
growing
and
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
perfect
truths
whatever
they
are
and
wherever
they
may
be
again
a
certain
kind
of
may
be
caused
by
a
germ
the
by
the
of
and
the
with
a
particular
artistic
personality
or
a
particular
type
or
group
of
personalities
tends
to
produce
equally
favorable
and
unfavorable
symptoms
but
the
unfavorable
ones
seem
to
be
more
contagious
perhaps
the
impulse
remark
of
some
famous
man
whose
name
we
forget
that
he
loved
music
but
hated
musicians
might
be
followed
with
some
good
results
at
least
part
of
the
time
to
see
the
sun
rise
a
man
has
but
to
get
up
early
and
he
can
always
have
bach
in
his
pocket
we
hear
that
smith
or
morgan
et
al
design
to
establish
a
course
at
rome
to
raise
the
standard
of
american
music
or
the
standard
of
american
composers
which
is
it
but
possibly
the
more
our
composer
accepts
from
his
patrons
et
al
the
less
he
will
accept
from
himself
it
may
be
possible
that
a
day
in
a
kansas
wheat
field
will
do
more
for
him
than
three
years
in
rome
it
may
be
that
many
men
perhaps
some
of
genius
if
you
wo
admit
that
all
are
geniuses
have
been
started
on
the
downward
path
of
subsidy
by
trying
to
write
a
thousand
dollar
prize
poem
or
a
ten
thousand
dollar
prize
opera
how
many
masterpieces
have
been
prevented
from
blossoming
in
this
way
a
cocktail
will
make
a
man
eat
more
but
will
not
give
him
a
healthy
normal
appetite
if
he
had
not
that
already
if
a
bishop
should
offer
a
prize
living
to
the
curate
who
will
love
god
the
hardest
for
fifteen
days
whoever
gets
the
prize
would
love
god
the
least
such
stimulants
it
strikes
us
tend
to
industrialize
art
rather
than
develop
a
spiritual
sturdiness
a
sturdiness
which
sedgwick
says
footnote
sedgwick
the
new
american
type
riverside
press
shows
itself
in
a
close
union
between
spiritual
life
and
the
ordinary
business
of
life
against
spiritual
feebleness
which
shows
itself
in
the
separation
of
the
two
if
one
spiritual
sturdiness
is
congenital
and
somewhat
perfect

is

this
by
and
upon
manner
may
finally
lead
some
to
believe
that
manner
for
manner

is
a
basis
of
music
someone
is
quoted
as
saying
that
ragtime
is
the
true
american
music
anyone
will
admit
that
it
is
one
of
the
many
true
natural
and
nowadays
conventional
means
of
expression
it
is
an
idiom
perhaps
a
set
or
series
of
colloquialisms
similar
to
those
that
have
added
through
centuries
and
through
natural
means
some
beauty
to
all
languages
every
language
is
but
the
evolution
of
slang
and
possibly
the
broad
a
in
harvard
may
have
come
down
from
the
butcher
of
southwark
to
examine
ragtime
rhythms
and
the
syncopations
of
schumann
or
of
brahms
seems
to
the
writer
to
show
how
much
alike
they
are
not
ragtime
as
we
hear
it
is
of
course
more
but
not
much
more
than
a
natural
dogma
of
shifted
accents
or
a
mixture
of
shifted
and
minus
accents
it
is
something
like
wearing
a
derby
hat
on
the
back
of
the
head
a
shuffling
lilt
of
a
happy
soul
just
let

a
baptist

ragtime
has
its
possibilities
but
it
does
not
represent
the
american
nation
any
more
than
some
fine
old
senators
represent
it
perhaps
we
know
it
now
as
an
ore
before
it
has
been
refined
into
a
product
it
may
be

of
nature

of
giving
art
raw
material
time
will
throw
its
vices
away
and
weld
its
virtues
into
the
fabric
of
our
music
it
has
its
uses
as
the
cruet
on
the
table
has
but
to
make
a
meal
of
tomato
ketchup
and
to
plant
a
whole
farm
with
sunflowers
even
to
put
a
sunflower
into
every
bouquet
would
be
calling
nature
something
worse
than
a
politician

whose
wholesome
influence
by
the
way
is
doing
as
much
perhaps
for
music
in
america
as
american
music
is
amusingly
says
if
indeed
the
land
of
lincoln
and
emerson
has
degenerated
until
nothing
remains
of
it
but
a
and
rattle
then
we
at
least
are
free
to
repudiate
this
false
patriotism
of
country
right
or
wrong
to
insist
that
better
than
bad
music
is
no
music
and
to
let
our
beloved
art
subside
finally
under
the
clangor
of
the
subway
gongs
and
automobile
horns
dead
but
not
dishonored
and
so
may
we
ask
is
it
better
to
sing
inadequately
of
the
leaf
on
walden
floating
and
die
dead
but
not
dishonored
or
to
sing
adequately
of
the
cherry
on
the
cocktail
and
live
forever
if
anyone
has
been
strong
enough
to
escape
these
rocks
this
scylla
and
charybdis
has
survived
these
wrong
choices
these
with
their
prizes
bohemias
and
heroes
is
not
such
a
one
in
a
better
position
is
he
not
abler
and
freer
to
declare
himself
and
so
to
love
his
cause
so
singly
that
he
will
cleave
to
it
and
forsake
all
else
what
is
this
cause
for
the
american
composer
but
the
utmost
musical
beauty
that
he
as
an
individual
man
with
his
own
qualities
and
defects
is
capable
of
understanding
and
striving
towards
forsaking
all
else
except
those
types
of
musical
beauty
that

sidney
lanier
in
a
letter
to
bayard
taylor
writes
i
have
so
many
fair
dreams
and
hopes
about
music
in
these
days
it
is
gospel
whereof
the
people
are
in
great
need
as
christ
gathered
up
the
ten
commandments
and
redistilled
them
into
the
clear
liquid
of
the
wondrous
eleventh
love
god
utterly
and
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
so
i
think
the
time
will
come
when
music
rightly
developed
to
its
now
little
forseen
grandeur
will
be
found
to
be
a
late
revelation
of
all
gospels
in
one
could
the
art
of
music
or
the
art
of
anything
have
a
more
profound
reason
for
being
than
this
a
conception
unlimited
by
the
narrow
names
of
christian
pagan
jew
or
angel
a
vision
higher
and
deeper
than
art
itself
the
humblest
composer
will
not
find
true
humility
in
aiming
low
he
must
never
be
timid
or
afraid
of
trying
to
express
that
which
he
feels
is
far
above
his
power
to
express
any
more
than
he
should
be
afraid
of
breaking
away
when
necessary
from
easy
first
sounds
or
afraid
of
admitting
that
those
half
truths
that
come
to
him
at
rare
intervals
are
half
true
for
instance
that
all
art
galleries
contain
masterpieces
which
are
nothing
more
than
a
history

should
never

always

a
if

truly
seeks
he
will
surely
find
many
things
to
sustain
him
he
can
go
to
a
part
of
alcott
philosophy
that
all
occupations
of
man
body
and
soul
in
their
diversity
come
from
but
one
mind
and
soul
if
he
feels
that
to
subscribe
to
all
of
the
foregoing
and
then
submit
though
not
as
evidence
the
work
of
his
own
hands
is
presumptuous
let
him
remember
that
a
man
is
not
always
responsible
for
the
wart
on
his
face
or
a
girl
for
the
bloom
on
her
cheek
and
as
they
walk
out
of
a
sunday
for
an
airing
people
will
see
them
but
they
must
have
the
air
he
can
remember
with
plotinus
that
in
every
human
soul
there
is
the
ray
of
the
celestial
beauty
and
therefore
every
human
outburst
may
contain
a
partial
ray
and
he
can
believe
that
it
is
better
to
go
to
the
plate
and
strike
out
than
to
hold
the
bench
down
for
by
facing
the
pitcher
he
may
then
know
the
umpire
better
and
possibly
see
a
new
parabola

presumption
if
it
be

be

no

can
then
be
done
either
side
cantabit
vacuus

latrone

to
divide
by
an
arbitrary
line
something
that
can
not
be
divided
is
a
process
that
is
disturbing
to
some
perhaps
our
deductions
are
not
as
inevitable
as
they
are
logical
which
suggests
that
they
are
not
logic
an
arbitrary
assumption
is
never
fair
to
all
any
of
the
time
or
to
anyone
all
the
time
many
will
resent
the
abrupt
separation
that
a
theory
of
duality
in
music
suggests
and
say
that
these
general
subdivisions
are
too
closely
to
be
labeled
decisively
this
or
that
there
is
justice
in
this
criticism
but
our
answer
is
that
it
is
better
to
be
short
on
the
long
than
long
on
the
short
in
such
an
abstruse
art
as
music
it
is
easy
for
one
to
point
to
this
as
substance
and
to
that
as
manner
some
will
hold
and
it
is
undeniable
in
fact
quite
obvious
that
manner
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
beauty
of
substance
and
that
to
make
a
too
arbitrary
division
or
distinction
between
them
is
to
interfere
to
some
extent
with
an
art
beauty
and
unity
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
this
too
but
on
the
other
hand
beauty
in
music
is
too
often
confused
with
something
that
lets
the
ears
lie
back
in
an
easy
chair
many
sounds
that
we
are
used
to
do
not
bother
us
and
for
that
reason
we
are
inclined
to
call
them
beautiful
frequently
possibly
almost
invariably
analytical
and
impersonal
tests
will
show
we
believe
that
when
a
new
or
unfamiliar
work
is
accepted
as
beautiful
on
its
first
hearing
its
fundamental
quality
is
one
that
tends
to
put
the
mind
to
sleep
a
narcotic
is
not
always
unnecessary
but
it
is
seldom
a
basis
of
progress
that
is
wholesome
evolution
in
any
creative
experience
this
kind
of
progress
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
beauty
at
least
in
its
deeper
emotional
interests
if
not
in
its
moral
values
the
above
is
only
a
personal
impression
but
it
is
based
on
carefully
remembered
instances
during
a
period
of
about
fifteen
or
twenty
years
possibly
the
fondness
for
individual
utterance
may
throw
out
a
arrangement
which
is
readily
accepted
as
beautiful
formulae
that
weaken
rather
than
toughen
up
the
if
the
composer
sincere
conception
of
his
art
and
of
its
functions
and
ideals
coincide
to
such
an
extent
with
these
permutations
of
tried
out
progressions
in
expediency
that
he
can
arrange
them
over
and
over
again
to
his
transcendent
delight
has
he
or
has
he
not
been
drugged
with
an
overdose
of
sounds
and
as
a
result
do
not
the
muscles
of
his
clientele
become
flabbier
and
flabbier
until
they
give
way
altogether
and
find
refuge
only
in
a
seasoned
opera
box
where
they
can
see
without
thinking
and
unity
is
too
generally
conceived
of
or
too
easily
accepted
as
analogous
to
form
and
form
as
analogous
to
custom
and
custom
to
habit
and
habit
may
be
one
of
the
parents
of
custom
and
form
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
parents
perhaps
all
unity
in
art
at
its
inception
is
and
but
time
insists
or
at
least
makes
us
or
inclines
to
make
us
feel
that
it
is
all
natural
it
is
easy
for
us
to
accept
it
as
such
the
unity
of
dress
for
a
man
at
a
ball
requires
a
collar
yet
he
could
dance
better
without
it
coherence
to
a
certain
extent
must
bear
some
relation
to
the
listener
subconscious
perspective
for
example
a
critic
has
to
listen
to
a
thousand
concerts
a
year
in
which
there
is
much
repetition
not
only
of
the
same
pieces
but
the
same
formal
relations
of
tones
cadences
progressions
etc
there
is
present
a
certain
routine
series
of
which
he
does
seem
to
need
until
they
disappear
instead
of
listening
to
music
he
listens
around
it
and
from
this
subconscious
viewpoint
he
inclines
perhaps
more
to
the
thinking
about
than
thinking
in
music
if
he
could
go
into
some
other
line
of
business
for
a
year
or
so
perhaps
his
perspective
would
be
more
naturally
normal
the
unity
of
a
sonata
movement
has
long
been
associated
with
its
form
and
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
necessary
a
first
theme
a
development
a
second
in
a
related
key
and
its
development
the
free
fantasia
the
recapitulation
and
so
on
and
over
again
richter
or
parker
may
tell
us
that
all
this
is
natural
for
it
is
based
on
the
form
but
in
spite
of
your
teachers
a
vague
feeling
sometimes
creeps
over
you
that
the
of
the
song
has
been
stretched
out
into
deformity
some
claim
for
tchaikowsky
that
his
clarity
and
coherence
of
design
is
unparalleled
or
some
such
word
in
works
for
the
orchestra
that
depends
it
seems
to
us
on
how
far
repetition
is
an
essential
part
of
clarity
and
coherence
we
know
that
butter
comes
from
cream
but
how
long
must
we
watch
the
churning
arm
if
nature
is
not
enthusiastic
about
explanation
why
should
tschaikowsky
be
beethoven
had
to
churn
to
some
extent
to
make
his
message
carry
he
had
to
pull
the
ear
hard
and
in
the
same
place
and
several
times
for
the
ear
was
tougher
than
the
one
but
the
great
russian
weeper
might
have
spared
us
to
emerson
unity
and
the
or
the
are
synonymous
unity
is
at
least
nearer
to
these
than
to
solid
geometry
though
geometry
may
be
all
unity
but
to
whatever
unpleasantness
the
holding
to
this
theory
of
duality
brings
us
we
feel
that
there
is
a
natural
law
underneath
it
all
and
like
all
laws
of
nature
a
liberal
interpretation
is
the
one
nearest
the
truth
what
part
of
these
supplements
are
opposites
what
part
of
substance
is
manner
what
part
of
this
duality
is
polarity
these
questions
though
not
immaterial
may
be
disregarded
if
there
be
a
sincere
appreciation
intuition
is
always
sincere
of
the
divine
spirit
of
the
thing
enthusiasm
for
and
recognition
of
these
higher
over
these
lower
values
will
transform
a
destructive
iconoclasm
into
creation
and
a
mere
devotion
into
consecration
a
consecration
which
like
amphion
music
will
raise
the
walls
of
thebes
assuming
and
then
granting
that
can
be
transformed
or
led
towards
an
eventual
consecration
by
recognizing
and
using
in
their
true
relation
as
much
as
one
can
these
higher
and
lower
dual
values
and
that
the
doing
so
is
a
part
if
not
the
whole
of
our
old
problem
of
paralleling
or
approving
in
art
the
highest
attributes
moral
and
spiritual
one
sees
in
life
if
you
will
grant
all
this
let
us
offer
a
practical
suggestion
a
thing
that
one
who
has
imposed
the
foregoing
should
try
to
do
just
out
of
common
decency
though
it
be
but
an
attempt
perhaps
to
make
his
speculations
less
speculative
and
to
beat
off
metaphysics
all
with
a
divine
spark
and
bards
without
feel
the
need
at
times
of
an
inspiration
from
without
the
breath
of
another
soul
to
stir
our
inner
flame
especially
when
we
are
in
pursuit
of
a
part
of
that
utmost
musical
beauty
that
we
are
capable
of
understanding
when
we
are
breathlessly
running
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
unforeseen
grandeur
of
lanier
dream
in
this
beauty
and
grandeur
perhaps
marionettes
and
their
souls
have
a
part
though
how
great
their
part
is
we
hear
is
still
undetermined
but
it
is
morally
certain
that
at
times
a
part
with
itself
must
be
some
of
those
greater
contemplations
that
have
been
caught
in
the
world
soul
as
it
were
and
nourished
for
us
there
in
the
soil
of
its
literature
if
an
interest
in
and
a
sympathy
for
the
of
men
like
charles
kingsley
marcus
aurelius
whit
tier
montaigne
paul

robert
browning
pythagoras
channing
milton

swedenborg

garrison
plutarch
ruskin
ariosto
and
all
kindred
spirits
and
souls
of
great
measure
from
david
down
to
rupert
brooke
if
a
study
of
the
thought
of
such
men
creates
a
sympathy
even
a
love
for
them
and
their
it
is
certain
that
this
however
inadequately
expressed
is
nearer
to
what

was
given

for
than
a
devotion
to
sensual
love
of

matters
little
here
whether
a
man
who
paints
a
picture
of
a
useless
beautiful
landscape
imperfectly
is
a
greater
genius
than
the
man
who
paints
a
useful
bad
smell
perfectly
it
is
not
intended
in
this
suggestion
that
inspirations
coming
from
the
higher
planes
should
be
limited
to
any
particular
thought
or
work
as
the
mind
receives
it
the
plan
rather
embraces
all
that
should
go
with
an
expression
of
the
it
is
of
the
underlying
spirit
the
direct
unrestricted
imprint
of
one
soul
on
another
a
portrait
not
a
photograph
of
the
personality
it
is
the
ideal
part
that
would
be
caught
in
this
canvas
it
is
a
sympathy
for
substance
the
together
with
a
consciousness
that
there
must
be
a
lower
value
the
demosthenic
part
of
the
philippics
the
ciceronic
part
of
the
catiline
the
sublimity
against
the
vileness
of
confessions
it
is
something
akin
to
but
something
more
than
these
predominant
partial
tones
of
hawthorne
the
grand
old
countenance
of
homer
the
decrepit
form
but
vivid
face
of
aesop
the
dark
presence
of
dante
the
wild
ariosto
rabelais
smile
of
mirth
the
profound
pathetic
humor
of
cervantes
the
shakespeare
spenser
meet
guest
for
allegoric
structure
the
severe
divinity
of
milton
and
bunyan
molded
of
humblest
clay
but
instinct
with
celestial
fire
there
are
communities
now
partly
vanished
but
cherished
and
sacred
scattered
throughout
this
world
of
ours
in
which
freedom
of
thought
and
soul
and
even
of
body
have
been
fought
for
and
we
believe
that
there
ever
lives
in
that
part
of
the
native
to
them
the
thoughts
which
these
have
inspired
america
is
not
too
young
to
have
its
divinities
and
its
place
legends
many
of
those
transcendent
thoughts
and
visions
which
had
their
birth
beneath
our
concord
elms
messages
that
have
brought
salvation
to
many
listening
souls
throughout
the
world
are
still
growing
day
by
day
to
greater
and
greater
beauty
are
still
showing
clearer
and
clearer
man
way
to
god
no
true
composer
will
take
his
substance
from
another
finite
being
but
there
are
times
when
he
feels
that
his
needs
some
liberation
from
at
least
a
part
of
his
own
soul
at
such
times
shall
he
not
better
turn
to
those
greater
souls
rather
than
to
the
external
the
immediate
and
the
garish
day
the
strains
of
one
man
may
fall
far
below
the
course
of
those
phaetons
of
concord
or
of
the
aegean
sea
or
of
westmorland
but
the
greater
the
distance
his
music
falls
away
the
more
reason
that
some
greater
man
shall
bring
his
nearer
those
higher
spheres
