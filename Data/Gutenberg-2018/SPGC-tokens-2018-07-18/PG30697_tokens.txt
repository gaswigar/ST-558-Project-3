i

for
this
day
i
the
mountain
in
the
summer
of
i
was
stationed
at
fort
wrangell
in
southeastern
alaska
whence
i
had
come
the
year
before
a
green
young
student
fresh
from
college
and
seminary
very
green
and
very
fresh
to
do
what
i
could
towards
establishing
the
white
man
civilization
among
the
thlinget
indians
i
had
very
many
things
to
learn
and
many
more
to
unlearn
thither
came
by
the
monthly
mail
steamboat
in
july
to
aid
and
counsel
me
in
my
work
three
men
of
national
reputation
henry
kendall
of
new
york
aaron
lindsley
of
portland
oregon
and
sheldon
jackson
of
denver
and
the
west
their
wives
accompanied
them
and
they
were
to
spend
a
month
with
us
standing
a
little
apart
from
them
as
the
steamboat
drew
to
the
dock
his
peering
blue
eyes
already
eagerly
scanning
the
islands
and
mountains
was
a
lean
sinewy
man
of
forty
with
waving
hair
and
beard
and
shoulders
slightly
stooped
he
wore
a
scotch
cap
and
a
long
gray
tweed
ulster
which
i
have
always
since
associated
with
him
and
which
seemed
the
same
garment
unsoiled
and
unchanged
that
he
wore
later
on
his
northern
trips
he
was
introduced
as
professor
muir
the
naturalist
a
hearty
grip
of
the
hand
and
we
seemed
to
coalesce
at
once
in
a
friendship
which
to
me
at
least
has
been
one
of
the
very
best
things
i
have
known
in
a
life
full
of
blessings
from
the
first
he
was
the
strongest
and
most
attractive
of
these
four
fine
personalities
to
me
and
i
began
to
recognize
him
as
my
master
who
was
to
lead
me
into
enchanting
regions
of
beauty
and
mystery
which
without
his
aid
must
forever
have
remained
unseen
by
the
eyes
of
my
soul
i
sat
at
his
feet
and
at
the
feet
of
his
spirit
i
still
sit
a
student
absorbed
surrendered
as
this
priest
of
nature
inmost
shrine
unfolds
to
me
the
secrets
of
his

fort
wrangell
near
the
mouth
of
the
stickeen
the
starting
point
of
the
expeditions
minor
excursions
culminated
in
the
chartering
of
the
little
steamer
on
which
our
party
augmented
by
two
or
three
friends
steamed
between
the
tremendous
glaciers
and
through
the
columned
canyons
of
the
swift
stickeen
river
through
the
narrow
strip
of
to
glenora
in
british
columbia
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
river
mouth
our
captain
was
nat
lane
a
grandson
of
the
famous
senator
joseph
lane
of
oregon
stocky
muscular
given
somewhat
to
strange
oaths
and
strong
liquids
and
eying
askance
our
group
as
we
struck
the
bargain
he
was
withal
a
genial
man
and
a
splendid
river
pilot
dropping
down
from
telegraph
creek
so
named
because
it
was
a
principal
station
of
the
great
projected
and
line
of
the
western
union
that
bubble
pricked
by
cyrus
field
cable
we
tied
up
at
glenora
about
noon
of
a
cloudless
day
amuse
yourselves
said
captain
lane
at
lunch
here
we
stay
till
two
morning
this
gale
blowing
from
the
sea
makes
safe
steering
through
the
canyon
impossible
unless
we
take
the
calm
i
saw
muir
eyes
light
up
with
a
peculiar
meaning
as
he
glanced
quickly
at
me
across
the
table
he
knew
the
leading
strings
i
was
in
how
those
and
their
motherly
wives
thought
they
had
a
special
mission
to
suppress
all
my
proclivities
toward
dangerous
adventure
and
especially
to
protect
me
from
that
wild
muir
and
his
schemes
of
mountain
climbing
where
is
it
i
asked
as
we
met
behind
the
pilot
house
a
moment
later
he
pointed
to
a
little
group
of
jagged
peaks
rising
right
up
from
where
we
stood
a
pulpit
in
the
center
of
a
vast
rotunda
of
magnificent
mountains
one
of
the
finest
viewpoints
in
the
world
he
said
how
far
to
the
highest
point
about
ten
miles
how
high
seven
or
eight
thousand
feet
that
was
enough
i
caught
the
with
guile
there
were
stickeen
indians
there
catching
salmon
and
among
them
chief
shakes
who
our
interpreter
said
was
the
youngest
but
the
headest
chief
of
all
last
night
palaver
had
whetted
the
appetites
of
both
sides
for
more
on
the
part
of
the
indians
a
talk
with
these
great
white
chiefs
from
washington
offered
unlimited
possibilities
for
material
favor
and
to
the
good
divines
the
simple
faith
and
childlike
docility
of
these
children
of
the
forest
were
a
constant
delight
and
then
how
well
their
compliments
and
flowery
metaphors
would
sound
in
article
and
speech
to
the
wondering
east
so
i
sent
stickeen
johnny
the
interpreter
to
call
the
natives
to
another
big
talk
and
in
hand
the
doctors
went
gayly
to
the
fray
i
set
the
speeches
and
then
slipped
out
to
join
the
impatient
muir
take
off
your
coat
he
commanded
and
here
your
supper
pocketing
two
hardtacks
apiece
we
were
off
keeping
in
shelter
of
house
and
bush
till
out
of
sight
of
the
and
the
ladies
then
we
broke
out
what
a
matchless
climate
what
sweet
air
sunshine
that
had
no
weakness
in
it
as
if
we
were
springing
plants
our
sinews
like
steel
springs
muscles
like
india
rubber
feet
soled
with
iron
to
grip
the
rocks
ten
miles
eight
thousand
feet
why
i
felt
equal
to
forty
miles
and
the
matterhorn
eh
mon
said
muir
lapsing
into
the
broad
scotch
he
was
so
fond
of
using
when
enjoying
himself
ye
see
the
sicht
o
yer
life
the
day
ye
get
that
be
o
mair
use
till
ye
than
a
the
gowd
o
cassiar
from
the
first
it
was
a
hard
climb
fallen
timber
at
the
foot
covered
with
thick
brush
swallowed
us
up
and
plucked
us
back
beyond
on
the
steeper
slopes
grew
dwarf
evergreens
five
or
six
feet
high
the
same
fir
that
towers
a
hundred
feet
with
a
diameter
of
three
or
four
on
the
river
banks
but
here
stunted
by
icy
mountain
winds
the
curious
blasting
of
the
branches
on
the
side
next
to
the
mountain
gave
them
the
appearance
of
humpbacked
hairy
gnomes
bristling
with
anger
stretching
forbidding
arms
downwards
to
bar
our
passage
to
their
sacred
heights
sometimes
an
inviting
vista
through
the
branches
would
lure
us
in
when
it
would
narrow
and
at
its
upper
angle
we
would
find
a
solid
phalanx
of
these
grumpy
dwarfs
then
we
had
to
attack
boldly
scrambling
over
the
obstinate
elastic
arms
and
against
the
clusters
of
stiff
needles
till
we
gained
the
upper
side
and
found
another
green
slope
muir
led
of
course
picking
with
sure
instinct
the
easiest
way
three
hours
of
steady
work
brought
us
suddenly
beyond
the
and
the
real
joy
of
the
day
began
nowhere
else
have
i
see
anything
approaching
the
luxuriance
and
variety
of
delicate
blossoms
shown
by
these
high
mountain
pastures
of
the
north
you
scarce
could
see
the
grass
for
flowers
everything
that
was
marvelous
in
form
fair
in
color
or
sweet
in
fragrance
seemed
to
be
represented
there
from
daisies
and
campanulas
to
muir
favorite
the
cassiope
with
its
exquisite
little
bells
shaped
like
and
its
subtle
perfume
muir
at
once
went
wild
when
we
reached
this
fairyland
from
cluster
to
cluster
of
flowers
he
ran
falling
on
his
knees
babbling
in
unknown
tongues
prattling
a
curious
mixture
of
scientific
lingo
and
baby
talk
worshiping
his
little
goddesses
ah
my
darlin
little
did
i
think
to
see
you
here
how
did
you
stray
away
from
shasta
well
well
who
thought
that
you
have
left
that
niche
in
the
merced
mountains
to
come
here
and
who
might
you
be
now
with
your
wonder
look
is
it
possible
that
you
can
be
two
latin
polysyllables
you
lost
my
dear
you
belong
in
tennessee
ah
i
thought
i
find
you
my
homely
little
sweetheart
and
so
on
unceasingly
so
absorbed
was
he
in
this
amatory
botany
that
he
seemed
to
forget
my
existence
while
i
as
glad
as
he
tagged
along
running
up
and
down
with
him
asking
now
and
then
a
question
learning
something
of
plant
life
but
far
more
of
that
spiritual
insight
into
nature
lore
which
is
granted
only
to
those
who
love
and
woo
her
in
her
great
outdoor
palaces
but
how
i
anathematized
my
foolishness
for
having
as
a
student
at
old
wooster
shirked
botany
for
the
more
important
studies
of
language
and
metaphysics
for
here
was
a
man
whose
natural
science
had
a
thorough
technical
basis
while
the
superstructure
was
built
of
lively
stones
and
was
itself
a
living
temple
of
love
with
all
his
boyish
enthusiasm
muir
was
a
most
painstaking
student
and
any
unsolved
question
lay
upon
his
mind
like
a
personal
grievance
until
it
was
settled
to
his
full
understanding
one
plant
after
another
with
its
roots
went
into
his
pockets
his
handkerchief
and
the
full
of
his
shirt
until
he
was
bulbing
and
sprouting
all
over
and
could
carry
no
more
he
was
taking
them
to
the
boat
to
analyze
and
compare
at
leisure
then
he
began
to
requisition
my
receptacles
i
stood
it
while
he
stuffed
my
pockets
but
rebelled
when
he
tried
to
poke
the
prickly
scratchy
things
inside
my
shirt
i
had
not
yet
attained
that
sublime
indifference
to
physical
comfort
that
nirvana
of
passivity
that
muir
had
found
hours
had
passed
in
this
entrancing
work
and
we
were
progressing
upwards
but
slowly
we
were
on
the
southeastern
slope
of
the
mountain
and
the
sun
was
still
staring
at
us
from
a
cloudless
sky
suddenly
we
were
in
the
shadow
as
we
worked
around
a
spur
of
rock
muir
looked
up
startled
then
he
jammed
home
his
last
handful
of
plants
and
hastened
up
to
where
i
stood
man
he
said
i
was
forgetting
we
have
to
hurry
now
or
we
miss
it
we
miss
it
miss
what
i
asked
the
jewel
of
the
day
he
answered
the
sight
of
the
sunset
from
the
top
then
muir
began
to
up
that
mountain
i
had
been
with
mountain
climbers
before
but
never
one
like
him
a
over
the
smoother
slopes
a
sure
instinct
for
the
easiest
way
into
a
rocky
fortress
an
instant
and
unerring
attack
a
up
the
steep
eye
hand
and
foot
all
connected
dynamically
with
no
appearance
of
weight
to
his
body
as
though
he
had
stockton
negative
gravity
machine
strapped
on
his
back
fifteen
years
of
enthusiastic
study
among
the
sierras
had
given
him
the
same
over
the
ordinary
climber
as
the
big
horn
of
the
rockies
shows
over
the
cotswold
it
was
only
by
exerting
myself
to
the
limit
of
my
strength
that
i
was
able
to
keep
near
him
his
example
was
at
the
same
time
my
inspiration
and
despair
i
longed
for
him
to
stop
and
rest
but
would
not
have
suggested
it
for
the
world
i
would
at
least
be
game
and
furnish
no
hint
as
to
how
tired
i
was
no
matter
how
chokingly
my
heart
thumped
muir
spirit
was
in
me
and
my
chief
end
just
then
was
to
win
that
peak
with
him
the
impending
calamity
of
being
beaten
by
the
sun
was
not
to
be
contemplated
without
horror
the
loss
of
a
fortune
would
be
as
nothing
to
that
illustration
the
mountain
he
pointed
to
a
little
group
of
jagged
peaks
rising
right
up
from
where
we
stood
a
pulpit
in
the
center
of
a
vast
rotunda
of
magnificent
mountains
we
were
now
beyond
the
flower
garden
of
the
gods
in
a
land
of
rocks
and
cliffs
with
patches
of
short
grass
caribou
moss
and
lichens
between
along
a
narrowing
arm
of
the
mountain
a
deep
canyon
flumed
a
rushing
torrent
of
icy
water
from
a
small
glacier
on
our
right
then
came
moraine
matter
rounded
pebbles
and
boulders
and
beyond
them
the
glacier
once
a
giant
it
is
nothing
but
a
baby
now
but
the
ice
is
still
blue
and
clear
and
the
crevasses
many
and
deep
and
that
day
it
had
to
be
crossed
which
was
a
ticklish
task
a
misstep
or
slip
might
land
us
at
once
fairly
into
the
heart
of
the
glacier
there
to
be
preserved
in
cold
storage
for
the
wonderment
of
future
generations
but
glaciers
were
muir
special
pets
his
intimate
companions
with
whom
he
held
sweet
communion
their
voices
were
plain
language
to
his
ears
their
work
as
god
landscape
gardeners
of
the
wisest
and
best
that
nature
could
offer
no
swiss
guide
was
ever
wiser
in
the
habits
of
glaciers
than
muir
or
proved
to
be
a
better
pilot
across
their
deathly
crevasses
half
a
mile
of
careful
walking
and
jumping
and
we
were
on
the
ground
again
at
the
base
of
the
great
cliff
of
metamorphic
slate
that
crowned
the
summit
muir
aneroid
barometer
showed
a
height
of
about
seven
thousand
feet
and
the
wall
of
rock
towered
threateningly
above
us
leaning
out
in
places
a
thousand
feet
or
so
above
the
glacier
but
the
that
had
melted
and
heaved
it
the
ice
mass
that
chiseled
and
shaped
it
the
wind
and
rain
that
corroded
and
crumbled
it
had
left
plenty
of
bricks
out
of
that
battlement
had
covered
its
face
with
knobs
and
horns
had
ploughed
ledges
and
cleaved
fissures
and
fastened
crags
and
pinnacles
upon
it
so
that
while
its
surface
was
full
of
and
blind
ways
the
human
spider
might
still
find
some
hold
for
his
claws
the
shadows
were
dark
upon
us
but
the
lofty
icy
peaks
of
the
main
range
still
lay
bathed
in
the
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
a
quick
glance
to
the
right
and
left
and
muir
who
had
steered
his
course
wisely
across
the
glacier
attacked
the
cliff
simply
saying
we
must
climb
cautiously
here
now
came
the
most
wonderful
display
of
his
had
i
been
alone
at
the
feet
of
these
crags
i
should
have
said
it
ca
be
done
and
have
turned
back
down
the
mountain
but
muir
was
my
control
as
the
spiritists
say
and
i
never
thought
of
doing
anything
else
but
following
him
he
thought
he
could
climb
up
there
and
that
settled
it
he
would
do
what
he
thought
he
could
and
such
climbing
there
was
never
an
instant
when
both
feet
and
hands
were
not
in
play
and
often
elbows
knees
thighs
upper
arms
and
even
chin
must
grip
and
hold
clambering
up
a
steep
slope
crawling
under
an
overhanging
rock
spreading
out
like
a
flying
squirrel
and
edging
along
an
projection
while
fingers
clasped
knobs
above
the
head
bending
about
sharp
angles
pulling
up
smooth
by
sheer
strength
of
arm
and
chinning
over
the
edge
leaping
fissures
sliding
flat
around
a
dangerous
testing
crumbly
spurs
before
risking
his
weight
always
going
up
up
no
hesitation
no
pause
that
was
muir
my
task
was
the
lighter
one
he
did
the
i
had
but
to
imitate
the
thin
fragment
of
projecting
slate
that
stood
the
weight
of
his
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
would
surely
sustain
my
hundred
and
thirty
as
far
as
possible
i
did
as
he
did
took
his
and
stepped
in
his
steps
but
i
was
handicapped
in
a
way
that
muir
was
ignorant
of
and
i
would
not
tell
him
for
fear
of
his
veto
upon
my
climbing
my
legs
were
all
right
hard
and
sinewy
my
body
light
and
supple
my
wind
good
my
nerves
steady
heights
did
not
make
me
dizzy
but
my
arms
there
lay
the
trouble
ten
years
before
i
had
been
fond
of
breaking
colts
till
the
colts
broke
me
on
successive
summers
in
west
virginia
two
colts
had
fallen
with
me
and
dislocated
first
my
left
shoulder
then
my
right
since
that
both
arms
had
been
out
of
joint
more
than
once
my
left
was
especially
weak
it
would
not
sustain
my
weight
and
i
had
to
favor
it
constantly
now
and
again
as
i
pulled
myself
up
some
difficult
reach
i
could
feel
the
head
of
the
humerus
move
from
its
socket
muir
climbed
so
fast
that
his
movements
were
almost
like
flying
legs
and
arms
moving
with
perfect
precision
and
unfailing
judgment
i
must
keep
close
behind
him
or
i
would
fail
to
see
his
points
of
vantage
but
the
pace
was
a
killing
one
for
me
as
we
neared
the
summit
my
strength
began
to
fail
my
breath
to
come
in
gasps
my
muscles
to
twitch
the
overwhelming
fear
of
losing
sight
of
my
guide
of
being
left
behind
and
failing
to
see
that
sunset
grew
upon
me
and
i
hurled
myself
blindly
at
every
fresh
obstacle
determined
to
keep
up
at
length
we
climbed
upon
a
little
shelf
a
foot
or
two
wide
that
corkscrewed
to
the
left
here
we
paused
a
moment
to
take
breath
and
look
around
us
we
had
ascended
the
cliff
some
nine
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
the
glacier
and
were
within
forty
or
fifty
feet
of
the
top
among
the
gifts
of
this
good
world
one
of
the
very
richest
was
given
to
me
in
that
hour
it
is
securely
locked
in
the
safe
of
my
memory
and
nobody
can
rob
me
of
it
an
imperishable
treasure
standing
out
on
the
rounded
neck
of
the
cliff
and
facing
the
southwest
we
could
see
on
three
sides
of
us
the
view
was
much
the
finest
of
all
my
experience
we
seemed
to
stand
on
a
high
rostrum
in
the
center
of
the
greatest
amphitheater
in
the
world
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
level
sun
flooding
all
the
landscape
with
golden
light
from
the
base
of
the
mountain
on
which
we
stood
stretched
the
rolling
upland
striking
boldly
across
our
front
was
the
deep
valley
of
the
stickeen
a
line
of
foliage
light
green
cottonwoods
and
darker
alders
sprinkled
with
black
fir
and
spruce
through
which
the
river
gleamed
with
a
silvery
sheen
now
spreading
wide
among
its
islands
now
foaming
white
through
narrow
canyons
beyond
among
the
undulating
hills
was
a
marvelous
array
of
lakes
there
must
have
been
thirty
or
forty
of
them
from
the
pond
of
an
acre
to
the
wide
sheet
two
or
three
miles
across
the
strangely
elongated
and
rounded
hills
had
the
appearance
of
giants
in
bed
wrapped
in
blankets
while
the
lakes
were
their
deep
blue
eyes
lashed
with
dark
evergreens
gazing
steadfastly
heavenward
look
long
at
these
recumbent
forms
and
you
will
see
the
heaving
of
their
breasts
the
whole
landscape
was
alert
expectant
of
glory
around
this
great
camp
of
prostrate
cyclops
there
stood
an
unbroken
semicircle
of
mighty
peaks
in
solemn
grandeur
some
some
with
locks
of
brown
but
all
wearing
white
glacier
collars
the
taller
peaks
seemed
almost
sharp
enough
to
be
the
helmets
and
spears
of
watchful
sentinels
and
the
colors
great
stretches
of
crimson
fireweed
acres
and
acres
of
them
smaller
patches
of
dark
blue
lupins
and
hills
of
shaded
yellow
red
and
brown
the
green
of
the
woods
the
amethyst
and
purple
of
the
far
horizon
who
can
tell
it
we
did
not
stand
there
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
but
the
whole
wonderful
scene
is
deeply
etched
on
the
tablet
of
my
memory
a
photogravure
never
to
be
effaced
the
rescue
the
mountain
faith
at
eventide
upon
a
dreary
sea
i
watched
a
mountain
rear
its
hoary
head
to
look
with
steady
gaze
in
the
near
heaven
the
earth
was
cold
and
still
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
of
the
sleeping
sea
the
mountain
drew
its
gray
close
like
roman
senator
erect
and
old
raising
aloft
an
earnest
brow
and
calm
with
upward
look
intent
of
steadfast
faith
the
sky
was
dim
no
shone
forth
to
crown
the
mountain
faith
which
faltered
not
but
ever
hopeful
waited
patiently
at
morn
i
looked
again
expectance
sat
of
immanent
glory
on
the
mountain
brow
and
in
a
moment
lo
the
glory
an
angel
hand
rolled
back
a
crimson
cloud
deep
light
of
wondrous
tone
and
power
a
crown
of
matchless
splendor
graced
its
head
majestic
kingly
pure
as
heaven
yet
warm
with
earthward
love
a
motion
like
a
heart
with
rich
blood
beating
seemed
to
sway
and
pulse
with
might
of
ecstasy
the
granite
peak
a
poem
grand
it
was
of
love
divine
an
anthem
sweet
and
strong
of
praise
to
god
a
from
barren
fields
of
death
its
gaze
was
heavenward
still
but
earthward
too
for
love
seeks
not
her
own
and
joy
is
full
only
when
freest
given
the
sun
shone
forth
and
now
the
mountain
doffed
its
ruby
crown
for
one
of
diamonds
still
the
light
streamed
down
no
longer
chill
and
bleak
the
morning
glowed
with
warmth
and
light
and
clouds
of
fiery
hue
mantled
the
crystal
glacier
chilly
stream
and
all
the
landscape
throbbed
with
sudden
joy
ii
the
rescue
muir
was
the
first
to
awake
from
his
trance
like
schiller
king
in
the
diver
nothing
could
slake
his
wild
thirst
of
desire
the
sunset
he
cried
we
must
have
the
whole
horizon
then
he
started
running
along
the
ledge
like
a
mountain
goat
working
to
get
around
the
vertical
cliff
above
us
to
find
an
ascent
on
the
other
side
he
was
soon
out
of
sight
although
i
followed
as
fast
as
i
could
i
heard
him
shout
something
but
could
not
make
out
his
words
i
know
now
he
was
warning
me
of
a
dangerous
place
then
i
came
to
a
fissure
which
lay
across
my
path
a
gash
in
the
rock
as
if
one
of
the
cyclops
had
struck
it
with
his
axe
it
sloped
very
steeply
for
some
twelve
feet
below
opening
on
the
face
of
the
precipice
above
the
glacier
and
was
filled
to
within
about
four
feet
of
the
surface
with
flat
slaty
gravel
it
was
only
four
or
five
feet
across
and
i
could
easily
have
leaped
it
had
i
not
been
so
tired
but
a
rock
the
size
of
my
head
projected
from
the
slippery
stream
of
gravel
in
my
haste
to
overtake
muir
i
did
not
stop
to
make
sure
this
stone
was
part
of
the
cliff
but
stepped
with
springing
force
upon
it
to
cross
the
fissure
instantly
the
stone
melted
away
beneath
my
feet
and
i
shot
with
it
down
towards
the
precipice
with
my
peril
sharp
upon
me
i
cried
out
as
i
whirled
on
my
face
and
struck
out
both
hands
to
grasp
the
rock
on
either
side
falling
forward
hard
my
hands
struck
the
walls
of
the
chasm
my
arms
were
twisted
behind
me
and
instantly
both
shoulders
were
dislocated
with
my
paralyzed
arms
flopping
helplessly
above
my
head
i
slid
swiftly
down
the
narrow
chasm
instinctively
i
flattened
down
on
the
sliding
gravel
digging
my
chin
and
toes
into
it
to
check
my
descent
but
not
until
my
feet
hung
out
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
did
i
feel
that
i
had
stopped
even
then
i
dared
not
breathe
or
stir
so
precarious
was
my
hold
on
that
treacherous
shale
every
moment
i
seemed
to
be
slipping
inch
by
inch
to
the
point
when
all
would
give
way
and
i
would
go
whirling
down
to
the
glacier
after
the
first
wild
moment
of
panic
when
i
felt
myself
falling
i
do
not
remember
any
sense
of
fear
but
i
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
thousand
thoughts
flash
through
the
brain
in
a
single
instant
an
anguished
thought
of
my
young
wife
at
wrangell
with
her
immanent
motherhood
an
indignant
thought
of
the
insurance
companies
that
refused
me
policies
on
my
life
a
thought
of
wonder
as
to
what
would
become
of
my
poor
flocks
of
indians
among
the
islands
recollections
of
events
far
and
near
in
time
important
and
trivial
but
each
thought
printed
upon
my
memory
by
the
instantaneous
photography
of
deadly
peril
i
had
no
hope
of
escape
at
all
the
gravel
was
rattling
past
me
and
piling
up
against
my
head
the
jar
of
a
little
rock
and
all
would
be
over
the
situation
was
too
desperate
for
actual
fear
dull
wonder
as
to
how
long
i
would
be
in
the
air
and
the
hope
that
death
would
be
instant
that
was
all
then
came
the
wish
that
muir
would
come
before
i
fell
and
take
a
message
to
my
wife
illustration
one
of
the
marvelous
array
of
lakes
suddenly
i
heard
his
voice
right
above
me
my
god
he
cried
then
he
added
grab
that
rock
man
just
by
your
right
hand
i
gurgled
from
my
throat
not
daring
to
inflate
my
lungs
my
arms
are
out
there
was
a
pause
then
his
voice
rang
again
cheery
confident
unexcited
hold
fast
i
going
to
get
you
out
of
this
i
ca
get
to
you
on
this
side
the
rock
is
sheer
i
have
to
leave
you
now
and
cross
the
rift
high
up
and
come
down
to
you
on
the
other
side
by
which
we
came
keep
cool
then
i
heard
him
going
away
whistling
the
blue
bells
of
scotland
singing
snatches
of
scotch
songs
calling
to
me
his
voice
now
receding
as
the
rocks
intervened
then
sounding
louder
as
he
came
out
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
but
in
me
hope
surged
at
full
tide
i
entertained
no
more
thoughts
of
last
messages
i
did
not
see
how
he
could
possibly
do
it
but
he
was
john
muir
and
i
had
seen
his
wonderful
so
i
determined
not
to
fall
and
made
myself
as
flat
and
heavy
as
possible
not
daring
to
twitch
a
muscle
or
wink
an
eyelid
for
i
still
felt
myself
slipping
slipping
down
the
greasy
slate
and
now
a
new
peril
threatened
a
chill
ran
through
me
of
cold
and
nervousness
and
i
slid
an
inch
i
suppressed
the
growing
shivers
with
all
my
will
i
would
keep
perfectly
quiet
till
muir
came
back
the
sickening
pain
in
my
shoulders
increased
till
it
was
torture
and
i
could
not
ease
it
it
seemed
like
hours
but
it
was
really
only
about
ten
minutes
before
he
got
back
to
me
by
that
time
i
hung
so
far
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
could
last
another
second
now
i
heard
muir
voice
low
and
steady
close
to
me
and
it
seemed
a
little
below
hold
steady
he
said
i
have
to
swing
you
out
over
the
cliff
then
i
felt
a
careful
hand
on
my
back
fumbling
with
the
waistband
of
my
pants
my
vest
and
shirt
gathering
all
in
a
firm
grip
i
could
see
only
with
one
eye
and
that
looked
upon
but
a
foot
or
two
of
gravel
on
the
other
side
now
he
said
and
i
slid
out
of
the
cleft
with
a
rattling
shower
of
stones
and
gravel
my
head
swung
down
my
impotent
arms
dangling
and
i
stared
straight
at
the
glacier
a
thousand
feet
below
then
my
feet
came
against
the
cliff
work
downwards
with
your
feet
i
obeyed
he
drew
me
close
to
him
by
crooking
his
arm
and
as
my
head
came
up
past
his
level
he
caught
me
by
my
collar
with
his
teeth
my
feet
struck
the
little
shelf
on
which
he
was
standing
and
i
could
see
muir
flattened
against
the
face
of
the
rock
and
facing
it
his
right
hand
stretched
up
and
clasping
a
little
spur
his
left
holding
me
with
an
iron
grip
his
head
bent
sideways
as
my
weight
drew
it
i
felt
as
alert
and
cool
as
he
i
got
to
let
go
of
you
he
hissed
through
his
clenched
teeth
i
need
both
hands
here
climb
upward
with
your
feet
how
he
did
it
i
know
not
the
miracle
grows
as
i
ponder
it
the
wall
was
almost
perpendicular
and
smooth
my
weight
on
his
jaws
dragged
him
outwards
and
yet
holding
me
by
his
teeth
as
a
panther
her
cub
and
clinging
like
a
squirrel
to
a
tree
he
climbed
with
me
straight
up
ten
or
twelve
feet
with
only
the
help
of
my
feet
scrambling
on
the
rock
it
was
utterly
impossible
yet
he
did
it
when
he
landed
me
on
the
little
shelf
along
which
we
had
come
my
nerve
gave
way
and
i
trembled
all
over
i
sank
down
exhausted
muir
only
less
tired
but
supporting
me
the
sun
had
set
the
air
was
icy
cold
and
we
had
no
coats
we
would
soon
chill
through
muir
task
of
rescue
had
only
begun
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
a
minute
he
was
up
again
examining
my
shoulders
the
right
one
had
an
upward
dislocation
the
ball
of
the
humerus
resting
on
the
process
of
the
scapula
the
rim
of
the
cup
i
told
him
how
and
he
soon
snapped
the
bone
into
its
socket
but
the
left
was
a
harder
proposition
the
luxation
was
downward
and
forward
and
the
strong
nervous
reaction
of
the
muscles
had
pulled
the
head
of
the
bone
deep
into
my
armpit
there
was
no
room
to
work
on
that
narrow
ledge
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
make
a
rude
sling
with
one
of
my
suspenders
and
our
handkerchiefs
so
as
to
both
support
the
elbow
and
keep
the
arm
from
swinging
then
came
the
task
to
get
down
that
terrible
wall
to
the
glacier
by
the
only
practicable
way
down
the
mountain
that
muir
after
a
careful
search
could
find
again
i
am
at
loss
to
know
how
he
accomplished
it
for
an
unencumbered
man
to
descend
it
in
the
deepening
dusk
was
a
most
difficult
task
but
to
get
a
tottery
cripple
down
was
a
feat
of
positive
wonder
my
right
arm
though
in
place
was
almost
helpless
i
could
only
move
my
forearm
the
muscles
of
the
upper
part
simply
refusing
to
obey
my
will
muir
would
let
himself
down
to
a
lower
shelf
brace
himself
and
i
would
get
my
right
hand
against
him
crawl
my
fingers
over
his
shoulder
until
the
arm
hung
in
front
of
him
and
falling
against
him
would
be
eased
down
to
his
standing
ground
sometimes
he
would
pack
me
a
short
distance
on
his
back
again
taking
me
by
the
wrist
he
would
swing
me
down
to
a
lower
shelf
before
descending
himself
my
right
shoulder
came
out
three
times
that
night
and
had
to
be
reset
it
was
dark
when
we
reached
the
base
there
was
no
moon
and
it
was
very
cold
the
glacier
provided
an
operating
table
and
i
lay
on
the
ice
for
an
hour
while
muir
having
slit
the
sleeve
of
my
shirt
to
the
collar
tugged
and
twisted
at
my
left
arm
in
a
vain
attempt
to
set
it
but
the
ball
was
too
deep
in
its
false
socket
and
all
his
pulling
only
bruised
and
made
it
swell
so
he
had
to
do
up
the
arm
again
and
tie
it
tight
to
my
body
it
must
have
been
near
midnight
when
we
left
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
started
down
the
mountain
we
had
ten
hard
miles
to
go
and
no
supper
for
the
hardtack
had
disappeared
ere
we
were
up
the
mountain
muir
dared
not
take
me
across
the
glacier
in
the
dark
i
was
too
weak
to
jump
the
crevasses
so
we
skirted
it
and
came
after
a
mile
to
the
head
of
a
great
slide
of
gravel
the
fine
moraine
matter
of
the
receding
glacier
muir
sat
down
on
the
gravel
i
sat
against
him
with
my
feet
on
either
side
and
my
arm
over
his
shoulder
then
he
began
to
hitch
and
kick
and
presently
we
were
sliding
at
great
speed
in
a
cloud
of
dust
a
full
we
flew
and
were
almost
buried
when
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
slide
it
was
the
easiest
part
of
our
trip
now
we
found
ourselves
in
the
canyon
down
which
tumbled
the
glacial
stream
and
far
beneath
the
ridge
along
which
we
had
ascended
the
sides
of
the
canyon
were
sheer
cliffs
we
try
it
said
muir
sometimes
these
canyons
are
passable
but
the
way
grew
rougher
as
we
descended
the
rapids
became
falls
and
we
often
had
to
retrace
our
steps
to
find
a
way
around
them
after
we
reached
the
some
four
miles
from
the
summit
the
going
was
still
harder
for
we
had
a
thicket
of
alders
and
willows
to
fight
here
muir
offered
to
make
a
fire
and
leave
me
while
he
went
forward
for
assistance
but
i
refused
no
i
said
i
going
to
make
it
to
the
boat
all
that
night
this
man
of
steel
and
lightning
worked
never
resting
a
minute
doing
the
work
of
three
men
helping
me
along
the
slopes
easing
me
down
the
rocks
pulling
me
up
cliffs
dashing
water
on
me
when
i
grew
faint
with
the
pain
and
always
cheery
full
of
talk
and
anecdote
cracking
jokes
with
me
infusing
me
with
his
own
indomitable
spirit
he
was
eyes
hands
feet
and
heart
to
me
my
caretaker
in
whom
i
trusted
absolutely
my
eyes
brim
with
tears
even
now
when
i
think
of
his
utter
as
he
ministered
to
my
infirmities
about
four
in
the
morning
we
came
to
a
fall
that
we
could
not
compass
sheer
a
hundred
feet
or
more
so
we
had
to
attack
the
steep
walls
of
the
canyon
after
a
hard
struggle
we
were
on
the
mountain
ridges
again
traversing
the
flower
pastures
creeping
through
openings
in
the
brush
scrambling
over
the
dwarf
fir
then
down
through
the
fallen
timber
it
was
seven
when
we
descended
the
last
slope
and
found
the
path
to
glenora
here
we
met
a
straggling
party
of
whites
and
indians
just
starting
out
to
search
the
mountain
for
us
as
i
was
coming
wearily
up
the
teetering
feeling
as
if
i
could
keep
up
another
minute
kendall
stepped
upon
its
end
barring
my
passage
bent
his
bushy
white
brows
upon
me
from
his
six
feet
of
height
and
began
to
scold
see
here
young
man
give
an
account
of
yourself
do
you
know
kept
us
waiting
just
then
captain
lane
jumped
forward
to
help
me
digging
the
old
doctor
of
divinity
with
his
elbow
in
the
stomach
and
nearly
knocking
him
off
the
boat
oh
hell
he
roared
ca
you
see
the
man
hurt
kendall
was
a
very
tall
thin
old
lady
with
face
lined
with
grief
by
the
loss
of
her
children
she
never
smiled
she
had
not
gone
to
bed
at
all
that
night
but
walked
the
deck
and
would
not
let
her
husband
or
the
others
sleep
soon
after
daylight
she
began
to
lash
the
men
with
the
whip
of
her
tongue
for
their
cowardice
and
inhumanity
in
not
starting
at
once
to
search
for
me
young
is
undoubtedly
lying
mangled
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
or
else
one
of
those
terrible
bears
has
wounded
him
and
you
are
lolling
around
here
instead
of
starting
to
his
rescue
for
shame
when
they
objected
that
they
did
not
know
where
we
had
gone
she
snapped
go
everywhere
until
you
find
him
her
fierce
energy
started
the
men
we
met
when
i
came
on
board
she
at
once
took
charge
and
issued
her
orders
which
everybody
jumped
to
obey
she
had
blankets
spread
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
and
laid
me
on
them
she
obtained
some
whisky
from
the
captain
some
water
porridge
and
coffee
from
the
steward
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
my
head
in
her
lap
feeding
me
coffee
with
a
spoon
when
kendall
came
in
and
began
on
me
again
suppose
you
had
fallen
down
that
precipice
what
would
your
poor
wife
have
done
what
would
have
become
of
your
indians
and
your
new
church
then
kendall
turned
and
thrust
her
spoon
like
a
sword
at
him
henry
kendall
she
blazed
shut
right
up
and
leave
this
room
have
you
no
sense
go
instantly
i
say
and
the
good
doctor
went
my
recollections
of
that
day
are
not
very
clear
the
shoulder
was
in
a
bad
condition
swollen
bruised
very
painful
i
had
to
be
strengthened
with
food
and
rest
and
muir
called
from
his
sleep
of
exhaustion
so
that
with
four
other
men
he
could
pull
and
twist
that
poor
arm
of
mine
for
an
hour
they
got
it
into
its
socket
but
scarcely
had
muir
got
to
sleep
again
before
the
strong
nervous
twitching
of
the
shoulder
dislocated
it
a
second
time
and
seemingly
placed
it
in
a
worse
condition
than
before
captain
lane
was
now
summoned
and
with
muir
to
direct
they
worked
for
two
or
three
hours
whisky
was
poured
down
my
throat
to
relax
my
stubborn
muscles
then
they
went
at
it
with
two
men
pulling
at
the
towel
knotted
about
my
wrist
two
others
pulling
against
them
foot
braced
to
foot
muir
manipulating
my
shoulder
with
his
sinewy
hands
and
the
stocky
captain
strong
and
compact
as
a
bear
with
his
heel
against
the
yarn
ball
in
my
armpit
takes
me
by
the
elbow
and
says
i

it

he
almost
does
the

i
am
conscious
of
a
frightful
strain
a
spasm
of
anguish
in
my
side

his
heel
slips
from

kicks
in

of
my
ribs
a
snap

in

i
wrapped
like
a

in

was
able
to
join
in
his
laughter
as
he
told
of
the
big
heroics
when
in
the
middle
of
an
acre
of
alder
brush
he
asked
indignantly
in
response
to
the
calls
do
you
think
i
going
to
leave
my
wife
in
this
forest
one
overpowering
regret
one
only
abides
in
my
heart

i
think
back
upon
that
golden
day
with
john
muir
he
could
and
did
go
back
to
glenora
on
the
return

ascend

see
the

from

top

charming

stay
all
night
and
see
the
sunrise
filling
his
cup
of
joy
so
full
that
he
could
pour
out
entrancing
descriptions
for
days

i
well
with
entreating
arms
about
one
neck
and
pleading
tearful
eyes
looking
into

could
one
do

promise
to
climb
no
more

my
lifelong
lamentation
over
a
treasure
forever
lost

iii
the
voyage
the
summer
and
fall
of
muir
always
referred
to
as
the
most
interesting
period
of
his
adventurous
life
from
about
the
tenth
of
july
to
the
twentieth
of
november
he
was
in
southeastern
alaska
very
little
of
this
time
did
he
spend
indoors
until
steamboat
navigation
of
the
stickeen
river
was
closed
by
the
forming
ice
he
made
frequent
trips
to
the
great
glacier
thirty
miles
up
the
river
to
the
hot
springs
the
mud
glacier
and
the
interior
lakes
ranges
forests
and
flower
pastures
always
upon
his
return
for
my
house
was
his
home
the
most
of
that
time
he
would
be
full
to
intoxication
of
what
he
had
seen
and
dinners
would
grow
cold
and
lamps
burn
out
while
he
held
us
entranced
with
his
impassioned
stories
although
his
books
are
all
masterpieces
of
lucid
and
glowing
english
muir
was
one
of
those
rare
souls
who
talk
better
than
they
write
and
he
made
the
trees
the
animals
and
especially
the
glaciers
live
before
us
somehow
a
glacier
never
seemed
cold
when
john
muir
was
talking
about
it
on
september
nineteenth
a
little
stranger
whose
expected
advent
was
keeping
me
at
home
arrived
in
the
person
of
our
daughter
for
two
or
three
weeks
preceding
and
following
this
event
muir
was
busy
writing
his
summer
notes
and
finishing
his
pencil
sketches
and
also
studying
the
flora
of
the
islands
it
was
a
season
of
constant
rains
when
the
the
southeast
blew
a
gale
but
these
stormy
days
and
nights
which
kept
ordinary
people
indoors
always
lured
him
out
into
the
woods
or
up
the
mountains
one
wild
night
dark
as
erebus
the
rain
dashing
in
sheets
and
the
wind
blowing
a
hurricane
muir
came
from
his
room
into
ours
about
ten
with
his
long
gray
overcoat
and
his
scotch
cap
on
where
now
i
asked
oh
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
he
replied
it
is
a
rare
chance
to
study
this
fine
storm
my
expostulations
were
in
vain
he
rejected
with
scorn
the
proffered
lantern
it
would
spoil
the
effect
i
retired
at
my
usual
time
for
i
had
long
since
learned
not
to
worry
about
muir
at
two
in
the
morning
there
came
a
hammering
at
the
front
door
i
opened
it
and
there
stood
a
group
of
our
indians
and
trembling
chief
moses
aaron
matthew
thomas
why
men
i
cried
what
wrong
what
brings
you
here
we
want
you
play
pray
answered
matthew
i
brought
them
into
the
house
and
putting
on
my
clothes
and
lighting
the
lamp
i
set
about
to
find
out
the
trouble
it
was
not
easy
they
were
greatly
excited
and
frightened
we
scare
all
stickeen
scare
plenty
cly
we
want
you
play
god
plenty
play
by
dint
of
much
questioning
i
gathered
at
last
that
the
whole
tribe
were
frightened
by
a
mysterious
light
waving
and
flickering
from
the
top
of
the
little
mountain
that
overlooked
wrangell
and
they
wished
me
to
pray
to
the
white
man
god
and
avert
dire
calamity
some
miner
has
camped
there
i
ventured
an
eager
chorus
protested
it
was
not
like
the
light
of
a
in
the
least
it
waved
in
the
air
like
the
wings
of
a
spirit
besides
there
was
no
gold
on
the
top
of
a
hill
like
that
and
no
human
being
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
camp
up
there
on
such
a
night
when
there
were
plenty
of
comfortable
houses
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
it
was
a
spirit
a
malignant
spirit
suddenly
the
true
explanation
flashed
into
my
brain
and
i
shocked
my
indians
by
bursting
into
a
roar
of
laughter
in
imagination
i
could
see
him
so
plainly
john
muir
wet
but
happy
feeding
his
fire
with
spruce
sticks
studying
and
enjoying
the
storm
but
i
explained
to
my
natives
who
ever
afterwards
eyed
muir
askance
as
a
mysterious
being
whose
ways
and
motives
were
beyond
all
conjecture
why
does
this
strange
man
go
into
the
wet
woods
and
up
the
mountains
on
stormy
nights
they
asked
why
does
he
wander
alone
on
barren
peaks
or
on
dangerous
there
is
no
gold
up
there
and
he
never
takes
a
gun
with
him
or
a
pick
what
make
why
why
the
first
week
in
october
saw
the
culmination
of
plans
long
and
eagerly
discussed
almost
the
whole
of
the
alexandrian
archipelago
that
great
group
of
eleven
hundred
wooded
islands
that
forms
the
southeastern
of
alaska
was
at
that
time
a
the
only
seaman
chart
of
the
region
in
existence
was
that
made
by
the
great
english
navigator
vancouver
in
it
was
a
wonderful
chart
considering
what
an
absurd
little
sailing
vessel
he
had
in
which
to
explore
those
intricate
waters
with
their
treacherous
winds
and
tides
but
vancouver
chart
was
hastily
made
after
all
in
a
land
of
fog
and
rain
and
snow
he
had
not
the
modern
surveyor
instruments
boats
or
other
helps
and
besides
this
region
was
changing
more
rapidly
than
perhaps
any
other
part
of
the
globe
volcanic
islands
were
being
born
out
of
the
depths
of
the
ocean
landslides
were
filling
up
channels
between
the
islands
tides
and
rivers
were
opening
new
passages
and
closing
old
ones
and
more
than
all
those
mightiest
tools
of
the
great
engineer
the
glaciers
were
furrowing
valleys
dumping
millions
of
tons
of
silt
into
the
sea
forming
islands
promontories
and
isthmuses
and
by
their
recession
letting
the
sea
into
deep
and
long
fiords
forming
great
bays
inlets
and
passages
many
of
which
did
not
exist
in
vancouver
time
in
certain
localities
the
living
glacier
stream
was
breaking
off
bergs
so
fast
that
the
resultant
bays
were
lengthening
a
mile
or
more
each
year
where
vancouver
saw
only
a
great
crystal
wall
across
the
sea
we
were
to
paddle
for
days
up
a
long
and
sinuous
fiord
and
where
he
saw
one
glacier
we
were
to
find
a
dozen
my
mission
in
the
proposed
voyage
of
discovery
was
to
locate
and
visit
the
tribes
and
villages
of
thlingets
to
the
north
and
west
of
wrangell
to
take
their
census
confer
with
their
chiefs
and
report
upon
their
condition
with
a
view
to
establishing
schools
and
churches
among
them
the
most
of
these
tribes
had
never
had
a
visit
from
a
missionary
and
i
felt
the
eager
zeal
an
eliot
or
a
martin
at
the
prospect
of
telling
them
for
the
first
time
the
good
news
muir
mission
was
to
find
and
study
the
forests
mountains
and
glaciers
i
also
was
eager
to
see
these
and
learn
about
them
and
muir
was
glad
to
study
the
natives
with
me
so
our
plans
fitted
into
each
other
well
we
are
going
to
write
some
history
my
boy
muir
would
say
to
me
think
of
the
honor
we
have
been
chosen
to
put
some
interesting
people
and
some
of
nature
grandest
scenes
on
the
page
of
human
record
and
on
the
map
hurry
we
are
daily
losing
the
most
important
news
of
all
the
world
in
many
respects
we
were
most
congenial
companions
we
both
loved
the
same
poets
and
could
repeat
verse
about
many
poems
of
tennyson
keats
shelley
and
burns
he
took
with
him
a
volume
of
thoreau
and
i
one
of
emerson
and
we
enjoyed
them
together
i
had
my
printed
bible
with
me
and
he
had
his
in
his
head
the
result
of
a
scotch
father
discipline
our
studies
supplemented
each
other
and
our
tastes
were
similar
we
had
both
lived
clean
lives
and
our
conversation
together
was
sweet
and
high
while
we
both
had
a
sense
of
humor
and
a
large
fund
of
stories
but
muir
knowledge
of
nature
and
his
insight
into
her
plans
and
methods
were
so
far
beyond
mine
that
while
i
was
organizer
and
commander
of
the
expedition
he
was
my
teacher
and
guide
into
the
inner
recesses
and
meanings
of
the
islands
bays
and
mountains
we
explored
together
our
ship
for
this
voyage
of
discovery
while
not
so
large
as
vancouver
was
much
more
shapely
and
manageable
a
six
fathom
canoe
it
belonged
to
our
captain
old
chief
a
chief
who
had
lately
embraced
christianity
with
his
whole
heart
one
of
the
simplest
most
faithful
dignified
and
brave
souls
i
ever
knew
he
fully
expected
to
meet
a
martyr
death
among
his
heathen
enemies
of
the
northern
islands
yet
he
did
not
shrink
from
the
voyage
on
that
account
his
crew
numbered
three
first
in
importance
was
kadishan
also
a
chief
of
the
stickeens
chosen
because
of
his
powers
of
oratory
his
kinship
with
chief
shathitch
of
the
chilcat
tribe
and
his
friendly
relations
with
other
chiefs
he
was
a
born
courtier
learned
in
indian
lore
songs
and
customs
and
able
to
instruct
me
in
the
proper
thlinget
etiquette
to
suit
all
occasions
the
other
two
were
sturdy
young
men
stickeen
john
our
interpreter
and
sitka
charley
they
were
to
act
as
cooks
oarsmen
hunters
and
general
utility
men
we
stowed
our
baggage
which
was
not
burdensome
in
one
end
of
the
canoe
taking
a
simple
store
of
provisions
flour
beans
bacon
sugar
salt
and
a
little
dried
fruit
we
were
to
depend
upon
our
guns
fishhooks
spears
and
clamsticks
for
other
diet
as
a
preliminary
to
our
palaver
with
the
natives
we
followed
the
old
hudson
bay
custom
then
firmly
established
in
the
north
we
took
materials
for
a
rice
and
sugar
our
indian
crew
laid
in
their
own
stock
of
provisions
chiefly
dried
salmon
and
while
our
table
was
to
be
separate
set
out
with
the
white
man
viands
we
did
not
get
off
without
trouble
kadishan
mother
who
looked
but
little
older
than
himself
strongly
objected
to
my
taking
her
son
on
so
perilous
a
voyage
and
so
late
in
the
fall
and
when
her
scoldings
and
entreaties
did
not
avail
she
said
if
anything
happens
to
my
son
i
will
take
your
baby
as
mine
in
payment
illustration
voyages
of
muir
and
young
and
in
southeastern
alaska
one
sunny
october
day
we
set
our
prow
to
the
unknown
northwest
our
hearts
beat
high
with
anticipation
every
passage
between
the
islands
was
a
corridor
leading
into
a
new
and
more
enchanting
room
of
great
gallery
the
lapping
waves
whispered
enticing
secrets
while
the
seabirds
screaming
overhead
and
the
eagles
shrilling
from
the
sky
promised
wonderful
adventures
the
voyage
naturally
divides
itself
into
the
human
interest
and
the
study
of
nature
yet
the
two
constantly
blended
throughout
the
whole
voyage
i
can
only
select
a
few
instances
from
that
trip
of
six
weeks
whose
every
hour
was
new
and
strange
our
captain
taciturn
and
commanded
muir
admiration
from
the
first
his
paddle
was
sure
in
the
stern
his
knowledge
of
the
wind
and
tide
unfailing
whenever
we
landed
the
crew
would
begin
to
dispute
concerning
the
best
place
to
make
camp
but
old
with
the
mast
in
his
hand
would
march
straight
as
an
arrow
to
the
likeliest
spot
of
all
stick
down
his
mast
as
a
and
begin
to
set
up
the
tent
the
others
invariably
acquiescing
in
his
decision
as
the
best
possible
choice
at
our
first
meal
muir
sense
of
humor
cost
us
of
a
roll
of
butter
we
invited
our
captain
to
take
dinner
with
us
i
got
out
the
bread
and
other
viands
and
set
the
roll
of
butter
beside
the
bread
and
placed
both
by
he
glanced
at
the
roll
of
butter
and
at
the
three
who
were
to
eat
measured
with
his
eye
of
the
roll
cut
it
off
with
his
hunting
knife
and
began
to
cut
it
into
squares
and
eat
it
with
great
gusto
i
was
about
to
interfere
and
show
him
the
use
we
made
of
butter
but
muir
stopped
me
with
a
wink
the
old
chief
calmly
devoured
his
third
of
the
roll
and
rubbing
his
stomach
with
great
satisfaction
pronounced
it
very
good
glease
of
necessity
we
had
chosen
the
rainiest
season
of
the
year
in
that
dampest
climate
of
north
america
where
there
are
two
hundred
and
rainy
days
out
of
the
three
hundred
and
during
our
voyage
it
did
not
rain
every
day
but
the
periods
of
sunshine
were
so
rare
as
to
make
us
hail
them
with
joyous
acclamation
we
steered
our
course
due
westward
for
forty
miles
then
through
a
sinuous
passage
called
rocky
strait
stopping
one
day
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
venison
before
sailing
on
to
the
village
of
the
kake
indians
my
habit
throughout
the
voyage
when
coming
to
a
native
town
was
to
find
where
the
head
chief
lived
feed
him
with
rice
and
regale
him
with
tobacco
and
then
induce
him
to
call
all
his
chiefs
and
head
men
together
for
a
council
when
they
were
all
assembled
i
would
give
small
presents
of
tobacco
to
each
and
then
open
the
floodgate
of
talk
proclaiming
my
mission
and
telling
them
in
simplest
terms
the
great
new
story
muir
would
generally
follow
me
unfolding
in
turn
some
of
the
wonders
of
god
handiwork
and
the
beauty
of
clean
pure
living
and
then
in
turn
beginning
with
the
head
chief
each
indian
would
make
his
speech
we
were
received
with
joy
everywhere
and
if
there
was
suspicion
at
first
old
tearful
pleadings
and
kadishan
oratory
speedily
brought
about
peace
and
unity
these
palavers
often
lasted
a
whole
day
and
far
into
the
night
and
usually
ended
with
our
being
feasted
in
turn
by
the
chief
in
whose
house
we
had
held
the
council
i
took
the
census
of
each
village
getting
the
heads
of
the
families
to
count
their
relatives
with
the
aid
of
beans
the
large
brown
beans
representing
men
the
large
white
ones
women
and
the
small
boston
beans
children
in
this
manner
the
first
census
of
southeastern
alaska
was
taken
before
starting
on
the
voyage
we
heard
that
there
was
a
harvard
graduate
bearing
an
honored
new
england
name
living
among
the
kake
indians
on
kouyou
island
on
arriving
at
the
chief
town
of
that
tribe
we
inquired
for
the
white
man
and
were
told
that
he
was
camping
with
the
family
of
a
at
the
mouth
of
a
salmon
stream
we
set
off
to
find
him
as
we
neared
the
shore
we
saw
a
circular
group
of
natives
around
a
fire
on
the
beach
sitting
on
their
heels
in
the
stoical
indian
way
we
landed
and
came
up
to
them
not
one
of
them
deigned
to
rise
or
show
any
excitement
at
our
coming
the
eight
or
nine
men
who
formed
the
group
were
all
dressed
in
colored
blankets
with
the
exception
of
one
who
had
on
a
ragged
fragment
of
a
filthy
hudson
bay
blanket
the
back
of
this
man
was
towards
us
and
after
speaking
to
the
chief
muir
and
i
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
saw
his
face
it
was
the
white
man
and
the
ragged
blanket
was
all
the
clothing
he
had
upon
him
an
effort
to
open
conversation
with
him
proved
futile
he
answered
only
with
grunts
and
mumbled
monosyllables
thus
the
most
filthy
degraded
hopelessly
lost
savage
that
we
found
in
this
whole
voyage
was
a
college
graduate
of
great
new
england
stock
lift
a
stone
to
mountain
height
and
let
it
fall
said
muir
and
it
will
sink
the
deeper
into
the
mud
at
angoon
one
of
the
towns
of
the
tribe
occurred
an
incident
of
another
type
we
found
this
village
hilariously
drunk
there
was
a
very
stringent
prohibition
law
over
alaska
at
that
time
which
absolutely
forbade
the
importation
of
any
spirituous
liquors
into
the
territory
but
the
law
was
deficient
in
one
vital
respect
it
did
not
prohibit
the
importation
of
molasses
and
a
soldier
during
the
military
occupancy
of
the
territory
had
instructed
the
natives
in
the
art
of
making
rum
the
method
was
simple
a
oil
can
was
taken
and
partly
filled
with
molasses
as
a
base
into
that
alcohol
was
placed
if
it
were
obtainable
dried
apples
berries
potatoes
flour
anything
that
would
rot
and
ferment
then
to
give
it
the
proper
tang
ginger
cayenne
pepper
and
mustard
were
added
this
mixture
was
then
set
in
a
warm
place
to
ferment
another
oil
can
was
cut
up
into
long
strips
the
solder
melted
out
and
used
to
make
a
pipe
with
two
or
three
turns
through
cool
water
forming
the
worm
and
the
still
talk
about
your
whiskey
i
have
seen
this
hooch
as
it
was
called
because
these
same
natives
first
made
it
kill
at
more
than
forty
rods
for
it
generally
made
the
natives
drunk
through
the
large
company
of
screaming
dancing
and
singing
natives
we
made
our
way
to
the
chief
house
by
some
miracle
this
savage
was
sober
perhaps
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
as
host
not
to
partake
himself
of
the
luxuries
with
which
he
regaled
his
guests
he
took
us
hospitably
into
his
great
community
house
of
split
cedar
planks
with
carved
totem
poles
for
corner
posts
and
called
his
young
men
to
take
care
of
our
canoe
and
to
bring
wood
for
a
fire
that
he
might
feast
us
the
wife
of
this
chief
was
one
of
the
finest
looking
indian
women
i
have
ever
met
tall
straight
lithe
and
dignified
but
crawling
about
on
the
floor
on
all
fours
was
the
most
piteous
travesty
of
the
human
form
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
an
idiot
boy
sixteen
years
of
age
he
had
neither
the
comeliness
of
a
beast
nor
the
intellect
of
a
man
his
name
was
bear
heart
and
indeed
all
his
motions
were
those
of
a
bear
rather
than
of
a
human
being
crossing
the
floor
with
the
swinging
gait
of
a
bear
he
would
crouch
back
on
his
haunches
and
resume
his
constant
occupation
of
sucking
his
wrist
into
which
he
had
thus
formed
a
livid
hole
when
disturbed
at
this
horrid
task
he
would
strike
with
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
snarling
and
grunting
yet
the
beautiful
chieftainess
was
his
mother
and
she
him
for
sixteen
years
she
had
cared
for
this
monster
feeding
him
with
her
choicest
food
putting
him
to
sleep
always
in
her
arms
taking
him
with
her
and
guarding
him
day
and
night
when
a
short
time
before
our
visit
the
medicine
men
accusing
him
of
causing
the
illness
of
some
of
the
head
men
of
the
village
proclaimed
him
a
witch
and
the
whole
tribe
came
to
take
and
torture
him
to
death
she
fought
them
like
a
lioness
not
counting
her
own
life
dear
unto
her
and
saved
her
boy
when
i
said
to
her
thoughtlessly
oh
would
you
not
be
relieved
at
the
death
of
this
poor
idiot
boy
she
saw
in
my
words
a
threat
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
pathetic
hunted
look
with
which
she
said
oh
no
it
must
not
be
he
shall
not
die
is
he
not
my
son
my
dear
little
son
if
our
voyage
had
yielded
me
nothing
but
this
wonderful
instance
of
i
should
have
counted
myself
richly
repaid
one
more
human
story
before
i
come
to
muir
part
it
was
during
the
latter
half
of
the
voyage
and
after
our
discovery
of
glacier
bay
the
climax
of
the
trip
so
far
as
the
missionary
interests
were
concerned
was
our
visit
to
the
chilcat
and
chilcoot
natives
on
lynn
canal
the
most
northern
tribes
of
the
alexandrian
archipelago
here
reigned
the
proudest
and
worst
old
savage
of
alaska
chief
shathitch
his
wealth
was
very
great
in
indian
treasures
and
he
was
reputed
to
have
cached
away
in
different
places
several
houses
full
of
blankets
guns
boxes
of
beads
ancient
carved
pipes
spears
knives
and
other
valued
heirlooms
he
was
said
to
have
stored
away
over
one
hundred
of
the
elegant
chilcat
blankets
woven
by
hand
from
the
hair
of
the
mountain
goat
his
tribe
was
rich
and
unscrupulous
its
members
were
the
between
the
whites
and
the
indians
of
the
interior
they
did
not
allow
these
indians
to
come
to
the
coast
but
took
over
the
mountains
articles
purchased
from
the
whites
guns
ammunition
blankets
knives
and
so
forth
and
bartered
them
for
furs
it
was
said
that
they
claimed
to
be
the
manufacturers
of
these
wares
and
so
charged
for
them
what
prices
they
pleased
they
had
these
indians
of
the
interior
in
a
bondage
of
fear
and
would
not
allow
them
to
trade
directly
with
the
white
men
thus
they
carried
out
literally
the
story
told
of
hudson
bay
traffic
piling
beaver
skins
to
the
height
of
a
hudson
bay
musket
as
the
of
the
musket
they
were
the
most
quarrelsome
and
warlike
of
the
tribes
of
alaska
and
their
villages
were
full
of
slaves
procured
by
forays
upon
the
coasts
of
vancouver
island
puget
sound
and
as
far
south
as
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river
i
was
eager
to
visit
these
large
and
untaught
tribes
and
establish
a
mission
among
them
illustration
chilcat
woman
weaving
a
blanket
chief
shathitch
was
said
to
have
over
one
hundred
of
the
elegant
chilcat
blankets
woven
by
hand
from
the
hair
of
the
mountain
goat
about
the
first
of
november
we
came
in
sight
of
the
long
village
of
as
we
paddled
up
the
winding
channel
of
the
chilcat
river
we
saw
great
excitement
in
the
town
we
had
hoisted
the
american
flag
as
was
our
custom
and
had
put
on
our
best
apparel
for
the
occasion
when
we
got
within
long
of
the
village
we
saw
the
native
men
come
rushing
from
their
houses
with
their
guns
in
their
hands
and
mass
in
front
of
the
largest
house
upon
the
beach
then
we
were
greeted
by
what
seemed
rather
too
warm
a
reception
a
shower
of
bullets
falling
unpleasantly
around
us
instinctively
muir
and
i
ceased
to
paddle
but
commanded
pull
pull
and
slowly
amid
the
dropping
bullets
we
zigzagged
our
way
up
the
channel
towards
the
village
as
we
drew
near
the
shore
a
line
of
runners
extended
down
the
beach
to
us
keeping
within
shouting
distance
of
each
other
then
came
the
questions
like
bullets
who
are
you
whence
do
you
come
what
is
your
business
here
and
stickeen
john
shouted
back
the
reply
a
great
and
a
great
have
come
to
bring
you
a
good
message
the
answer
was
shouted
back
along
the
line
and
then
returned
a
message
of
greeting
and
welcome
we
were
to
be
the
guests
of
the
chief
of
old
silver
eye
so
called
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
wearing
on
all
state
occasions
a
huge
pair
of
spectacles
which
a
russian
officer
had
given
him
he
confessed
he
could
not
see
through
them
but
thought
they
lent
dignity
to
his
countenance
we
paddled
slowly
up
to
the
village
and
muir
and
i
watching
with
interest
saw
the
warriors
all
disappear
as
our
prow
touched
the
sand
however
here
they
came
forty
or
fifty
of
them
without
their
guns
this
time
but
charging
down
upon
us
with
as
if
they
were
going
to
take
us
prisoners
dashing
into
the
water
they
ranged
themselves
along
each
side
of
the
canoe
then
lifting
up
our
canoe
with
us
in
it
they
rushed
with
excited
cries
up
the
bank
to
the
chief
house
and
set
us
down
at
his
door
it
was
the
thlinget
way
of
paying
us
honor
as
great
guests
then
we
were
solemnly
ushered
into
the
presence
of
his
house
was
large
covering
about
fifty
by
sixty
feet
of
ground
the
interior
was
built
in
the
usual
fashion
of
a
chief
house
carved
corner
posts
a
square
of
gravel
in
the
center
of
the
room
for
the
fire
surrounded
by
great
hewn
cedar
planks
set
on
edge
a
platform
of
some
six
feet
in
width
running
clear
around
the
room
then
other
planks
on
edge
and
a
high
platform
where
the
chieftain
household
goods
were
stowed
and
where
the
family
took
their
repose
a
brisk
fire
was
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
after
a
short
palaver
with
gifts
of
tobacco
and
rice
to
the
chief
it
was
announced
that
he
would
pay
us
the
distinguished
honor
of
feasting
us
first
it
was
a
banquet
we
were
seated
on
the
lower
platform
with
our
feet
towards
the
fire
and
before
muir
and
me
were
placed
huge
washbowls
of
blue
hudson
bay
ware
before
each
of
our
native
attendants
was
placed
a
great
carved
wooden
trough
holding
about
as
much
as
the
washbowls
we
had
learned
enough
indian
etiquette
to
know
that
at
each
course
our
respective
vessels
were
to
be
filled
full
of
food
and
we
were
expected
to
carry
off
what
we
could
not
devour
it
was
indeed
a
feast
of
fat
things
the
first
course
was
what
for
the
indian
takes
the
place
of
bread
among
the
whites
dried
salmon
it
was
served
a
whole
washbowlful
for
each
of
us
with
a
dressing
of
muir
and
i
adroitly
manoeuvred
so
as
to
get
our
salmon
and
served
separately
for
our
stomachs
had
not
been
sufficiently
trained
to
endure
that
rancid
grease
this
course
finished
what
was
left
was
dumped
into
receptacles
in
our
canoe
and
guarded
from
the
dogs
by
young
men
especially
appointed
for
that
purpose
our
washbowls
were
cleansed
and
the
second
course
brought
on
this
consisted
of
the
back
fat
of
the
deer
great
long
hunks
of
it
served
with
a
gravy
of
the
third
course
was
little
russian
potatoes
about
the
size
of
walnuts
dished
out
to
us
a
washbowlful
with
a
dressing
of
the
final
course
was
the
only
berry
then
in
season
the
long
fleshy
apple
of
the
wild
rose
mellowed
with
frost
served
to
us
in
the
usual
quantity
with
the
invariable
sauce
of
mon
mon
said
muir
aside
to
me
i
fashed
we
be
floppin
aboot
i
the
sea
whiles
wi
flippers
an
forked
tails
when
we
had
partaken
of
as
much
of
this
feast
of
fat
things
as
our
civilized
stomachs
would
stand
it
was
suddenly
announced
that
we
were
about
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
great
chief
of
the
chilcats
and
the
chilcoots
old
chief
shathitch
in
order
to
properly
receive
his
majesty
muir
and
i
and
our
two
chiefs
were
each
given
a
whole
bale
of
hudson
bay
blankets
for
a
couch
shathitch
made
us
wait
a
long
time
doubtless
to
impress
us
with
his
dignity
as
supreme
chief
the
heat
of
the
fire
after
the
wind
and
cold
of
the
day
made
us
very
drowsy
we
fought
off
sleep
however
and
at
last
in
came
stalking
the
biggest
chief
of
all
alaska
clothed
in
his
robe
of
state
which
was
an
elegant
chinchilla
blanket
and
upon
its
yellow
surface
as
the
chief
slowly
turned
about
to
show
us
what
was
written
thereon
we
were
astonished
to
see
printed
in
black
letters
these
words
to
chief
shathitch
from
his
friend
william
h
seward
we
learned
afterwards
that
seward
in
his
voyage
of
investigation
had
penetrated
to
this
town
had
been
received
in
royal
state
by
the
old
chief
and
on
his
return
to
the
states
had
sent
back
this
token
of
his
appreciation
of
the
chief
hospitality
whether
seward
was
regaled
with
viands
similar
to
those
offered
to
us
history
does
not
relate
to
me
the
inspiring
part
of
that
voyage
came
next
day
when
i
preached
from
early
morning
until
midnight
only
occasionally
relieved
by
muir
and
by
the
responsive
speeches
of
the
natives
more
more
tell
us
more
they
would
cry
it
is
a
good
talk
we
never
heard
this
story
before
and
when
i
would
inquire
of
what
do
you
wish
me
now
to
talk
they
would
always
say
tell
us
more
of
the
man
from
heaven
who
died
for
us
runners
had
been
sent
to
the
chilcoot
village
on
the
eastern
arm
of
lynn
canal
and
miles
up
the
chilcat
river
to
shathitch
town
of
klukwan
and
as
the
day
wore
away
the
crowd
of
indians
had
increased
so
greatly
that
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
large
house
i
heard
a
scrambling
upon
the
roof
and
looking
up
i
saw
a
row
of
black
heads
around
the
great
in
the
center
of
the
roof
after
a
little
a
ripping
tearing
sound
came
from
the
sides
of
the
building
they
were
prying
off
the
planks
in
order
that
those
outside
might
hear
when
my
voice
faltered
with
long
talking
and
kadishan
took
up
the
story
telling
what
they
had
learned
of
the
white
man
religion
or
muir
told
the
eager
natives
wonderful
things
about
what
the
great
one
god
whose
name
is
love
was
doing
for
them
the
meeting
was
only
interrupted
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
when
we
walked
with
the
chiefs
across
the
narrow
isthmus
between
pyramid
harbor
and
the
eastern
arm
of
lynn
canal
and
i
selected
the
harbor
farm
and
townsite
now
occupied
by
haines
mission
and

and
fort

this
was
the

of

iv
the

the
part
of
the
voyage
was
woven
in
with
the
missionary
trip
as
intimately
as
warp
with
woof
no
island
rock
forest
mountain
or
glacier
which
we
passed
near
or
far
was
neglected
we
went
so
at
our
own
sweet
will
without
any
set
time
or
schedule
that
we
were
constantly
finding
objects
and
points
of
surprise
and
interest
when
we
landed
the
algæ
which
sometimes
filled
the
little
harbors
the
limpets
and
lichens
of
the
rocks
the
fucus
pods
that
snapped
beneath
our
feet
the
grasses
of
the
beach
the
moss
and
shrubbery
among
the
trees
and
more
than
all
the
majestic
forests
claimed
attention
and
study
muir
was
one
of
the
most
expert
foresters
this
country
has
ever
produced
he
was
never
at
a
loss
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
this
wet
coast
filled
him
with
admiration
and
he
never
took
a
walk
from
camp
but
he
had
a
whole
volume
of
things
to
tell
me
and
he
was
constantly
bringing
in
trophies
of
which
he
was
prouder
than
any
hunter
of
his
antlers
now
it
was
a
bunch
of
ferns
as
high
as
his
head
now
a
cluster
of
minute
and
wonderfully
beautiful
moss
blossoms
now
a
curious
fungous
growth
now
a
spruce
branch
heavy
with
cones
and
again
he
would
call
me
into
the
forest
to
see
a
strange
and
grotesque
moss
formation
on
a
dead
stump
looking
like
a
tree
standing
upon
its
head
thus
although
his
objective
was
the
glaciers
his
thorough
knowledge
of
botany
and
his
interest
in
that
study
made
every
camp
just
the
place
he
wished
to
be
he
always
claimed
that
there
was
more
of
pure
ethics
and
even
of
moral
evil
and
good
to
be
learned
in
the
wilderness
than
from
any
book
or
in
any
abode
of
man
he
was
fond
of
quoting
wordsworth
stanza
one
impulse
from
a
vernal
wood
will
teach
you
more
of
man
of
moral
evil
and
of
good
than
all
the
sages
can
muir
was
a
devout
theist
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
unity
of
god
the
immanence
of
god
in
nature
and
his
management
of
all
the
affairs
of
the
universe
was
his
constantly
reiterated
belief
he
saw
design
in
many
things
which
the
ordinary
naturalist
overlooks
such
as
the
symmetry
of
an
island
the
balancing
branches
of
a
tree
the
harmony
of
colors
in
a
group
of
flowers
the
completion
of
a
fully
rounded
landscape
in
his
view
the
creator
of
it
all
saw
every
beautiful
and
sublime
thing
from
every
viewpoint
and
had
thus
formed
it
not
merely
for
his
own
delight
but
for
the
delectation
and
instruction
of
his
human
children
look
at
that
now
he
would
say
when
on
turning
a
point
a
wonderful
vista
of
sea
between
mountains
with
one
of
matchless
sunsets
at
the
end
would
wheel
into
sight
why
it
looks
as
if
these
giants
of
god
great
army
had
just
now
marched
into
their
stations
every
one
placed
just
right
just
right
what
landscape
gardening
what
a
scheme
of
things
and
to
think
that
he
should
plan
to
bring
us
feckless
creatures
here
at
the
right
moment
and
then
flash
such
glories
at
us
man
we
not
worthy
of
such
honor
thus
muir
was
always
discovering
to
me
things
which
i
would
never
have
seen
myself
and
opening
up
to
me
new
avenues
of
knowledge
delight
and
adoration
there
was
something
so
intimate
in
his
theism
that
it
purified
elevated
and
broadened
mine
even
when
i
could
not
agree
with
him
his
constant
exclamation
when
a
fine
landscape
would
burst
upon
our
view
or
a
shaft
of
light
would
pierce
the
clouds
and
glorify
a
mountain
was
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
two
or
three
great
adventures
stand
out
prominently
in
this
wonderful
voyage
of
discovery
two
weeks
from
home
brought
us
to
icy
straits
and
the
homes
of
the
hoonah
tribe
here
the
knowledge
of
the
way
on
the
part
of
our
crew
ended
we
put
into
the
large
hoonah
village
on
chichagof
island
after
the
usual
preaching
and
we
took
aboard
a
of
the
hoonahs
who
was
a
noted
seal
hunter
and
therefore
able
to
guide
us
among
the
of
the
mysterious
glacier
bay
of
which
we
had
heard
vancouver
chart
gave
us
no
intimation
of
any
inlet
whatever
but
the
natives
told
of
vast
masses
of
floating
ice
of
a
constant
noise
of
thunder
when
they
crashed
from
the
glaciers
into
the
sea
and
also
of
fearsome
bays
and
passages
full
of
evil
spirits
which
made
them
very
perilous
to
navigate
in
one
bay
there
was
said
to
be
a
giant
with
arms
as
long
as
a
tree
lurking
in
malignant
patience
awaiting
the
passage
that
way
of
an
unwary
canoe
when
up
would
flash
those
terrible
arms
with
their
thousand
suckers
and
seizing
their
prey
would
drag
down
the
men
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
to
be
mangled
and
devoured
by
the
horrid
beak
another
deep
fiord
was
the
abode
of
the
the
mischievous
puck
of
indian
lore
who
was
waiting
for
voyagers
to
land
and
camp
when
he
would
seize
their
sleeping
forms
and
transport
them
a
dozen
miles
in
a
moment
or
cradle
them
on
the
tops
of
the
highest
trees
again
there
was
a
most
rapacious
and
ferocious
in
a
piece
of
swift
water
whose
delight
it
was
to
take
into
his
great
jaws
whole
canoes
with
their
crews
of
men
mangling
them
and
gulping
them
down
as
a
single
mouthful
many
were
these
stories
of
fear
told
us
at
the
hoonah
village
the
night
before
we
started
to
explore
the
icy
bay
and
our
credulous
stickeens
gave
us
rather
broad
hints
that
it
was
time
to
turn
back
there
are
no
natives
up
in
that
region
there
is
nothing
to
hunt
there
is
no
gold
there
why
do
you
persist
in
this
aimless
journey
you
are
likely
to
meet
death
and
nothing
else
if
you
go
into
that
dangerous
region
all
these
stories
made
us
the
more
eager
to
explore
the
wonders
beyond
and
we
hastened
away
from
hoonah
with
our
guide
aboard
a
day
sail
brought
us
to
a
little
heavily
wooded
island
near
the
mouth
of
glacier
bay
this
we
named
pleasant
island
as
we
broke
camp
in
the
morning
our
guide
said
we
must
take
on
board
a
supply
of
dry
wood
here
as
there
is
none
beyond
leaving
this
last
green
island
we
steered
northwest
into
the
great
bay
the
country
of
ice
and
bare
rocks
muir
excitement
was
increasing
every
moment
and
as
the
majestic
arena
opened
before
us
and
the
muir
geicke
pacific
and
other
great
glaciers
all
nameless
as
yet
began
to
appear
he
could
hardly
contain
himself
he
was
impatient
of
any
delay
and
was
constantly
calling
to
the
crew
to
redouble
their
efforts
and
get
close
to
these
wonders
now
the
marks
of
recent
glaciation
showed
plainly
here
was
a
conical
island
of
gray
granite
whose
rounded
top
and
symmetrical
shoulders
were
worn
smooth
as
a
scotch
monument
by
grinding
glaciers
here
was
a
great
mountain
slashed
sheer
across
its
face
showing
sharp
edge
and
flat
surface
as
if
a
slab
of
mountain
size
had
been
sawed
from
it
yonder
again
loomed
a
granite
range
whose
huge
breasts
were
rounded
and
polished
by
the
resistless
sweep
of
that
great
ice
mass
which
vancouver
saw
filling
the
bay
soon
the
icebergs
were
charging
down
upon
us
with
the
receding
tide
and
dressing
up
in
compact
phalanx
when
the
tide
arose
first
would
come
the
advance
guard
of
smaller
bergs
with
here
and
there
a
mass
of
cobalt
blue
with
streaks
of
white
and
deeper
recesses
of
here
we
passed
an
solid
figure
of
ice
there
towered
an
antlered
formation
like
the
horns
of
a
stag
now
we
must
use
all
caution
and
give
the
larger
icebergs
a
wide
berth
they
are
treacherous
creatures
these
icebergs
you
may
be
paddling
along
by
a
peaceful
looking
berg
sleeping
on
the
water
as
mild
and
harmless
as
a
lamb
when
suddenly
he
will
take
a
notion
to
turn
over
and
up
under
your
canoe
will
come
a
spear
of
ice
impaling
it
and
lifting
it
and
its
occupants
skyward
then
turning
over
down
will
go
canoe
and
men
to
the
depths
our
progress
up
the
sixty
miles
of
glacier
bay
was
very
slow
three
nights
we
camped
on
the
bare
granite
rock
before
we
reached
the
limit
of
the
bay
all
vegetation
had
disappeared
hardly
a
bunch
of
grass
was
seen
the
only
signs
of
former
life
were
the
sodden
and
splintered
spruce
and
fir
stumps
that
projected
here
and
there
from
the
bases
of
huge
gravel
heaps
the
moraine
matter
of
the
mighty
ice
mass
that
had
engulfed
them
they
told
the
story
of
great
forests
which
had
once
covered
this
whole
region
until
the
great
sea
of
ice
of
the
second
glacial
period
overwhelmed
and
ground
them
down
and
buried
them
deep
under
its
moraine
matter
when
we
landed
there
were
no
level
spots
on
which
to
pitch
our
tent
and
no
sandy
beaches
or
gravel
beds
in
which
to
sink
our
i
learned
from
muir
the
gentle
art
of
sleeping
on
a
rock
curled
like
a
squirrel
around
a
boulder
we
passed
by
muir
glacier
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
seeking
to
attain
the
extreme
end
of
the
great
fiord
we
estimated
the
distance
by
the
tide
and
our
rate
of
rowing
tracing
the
and
islands
as
we
went
along
and
getting
the
points
of
the
compass
from
our
little
pocket
instrument
rain
was
falling
almost
constantly
during
the
week
we
spent
in
glacier
bay
now
and
then
the
clouds
would
lift
showing
the
twin
peaks
of
la
perouse
and
the
majestic
summits
of
mts
fairweather
and
crillon
these
mighty
summits
twelve
thousand
fifteen
thousand
and
sixteen
thousand
feet
high
respectively
pierced
the
sky
directly
above
us
sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
hanging
over
us
threateningly
only
once
did
the
sky
completely
clear
and
then
was
preached
to
us
the
wonderful
sermon
of
glacier
bay
early
that
morning
we
quitted
our
camp
on
a
barren
rock
steering
towards
mt
fairweather
a
night
of
sleepless
discomfort
had
ushered
in
a
bleak
gray
morning
our
indians
were
sullen
and
silent
their
scowling
looks
resenting
our
relentless
purpose
to
attain
to
the
head
of
the
bay
the
air
was
damp
and
raw
chilling
us
to
the
marrow
the
forbidding
granite
mountains
showing
here
and
there
through
the
fog
seemed
suddenly
to
push
out
threatening
fists
and
shoulders
at
us
all
night
long
the
had
bombarded
us
from
four
or
five
directions
when
the
great
masses
of
ice
from
living
glaciers
toppled
into
the
sea
crashing
and
grinding
with
the
noise
of
thunder
the
granite
walls
hurled
back
the
sound
in
reiterated
peals
multiplying
its
volume
a
hundredfold
there
was
no
love
apparent
on
that
bleak
gray
morning
power
was
there
in
appalling
force
visions
of
those
evergreen
forests
that
had
once
clung
trustingly
to
these
mountain
walls
but
had
been
swept
one
and
all
by
the
relentless
forces
of
the
ice
and
buried
deep
under
mountains
of
moraine
matter
but
added
to
the
present
desolation
we
could
not
enjoy
we
could
only
endure
death
from
overturning
icebergs
from
charging
tides
from
mountain
avalanche
threatened
us
suddenly
i
heard
muir
catch
his
breath
with
a
fervent
ejaculation
god
almighty
he
said
following
his
gaze
towards
mt
crillon
i
saw
the
summit
highest
of
all
crowned
with
glory
indeed
it
was
not
sunlight
there
was
no
appearance
of
shining
it
was
as
if
the
great
artist
with
one
sweep
of
his
brush
had
laid
upon
the
of
all
a
crown
of
the
most
brilliant
of
all
colors
as
if
a
pigment
perfectly
made
and
thickly
spread
too
delicate
for
crimson
too
intense
for
pink
had
leaped
in
a
moment
upon
the
mountain
top
an
awful
rose
of
dawn
the
summit
nearest
heaven
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
its
glory
it
was
a
rose
blooming
in
a
in
the
midst
of
a
stern
epic
a
drop
from
the
heart
of
christ
upon
the
icy
desolation
and
barren
affections
of
a
world
it
warmed
and
thrilled
us
in
an
instant
we
who
had
been
dull
and
apathetic
a
moment
before
shivering
in
our
wet
blankets
were
glowing
and
exultant
now
even
the
indians
ceased
their
paddling
gazing
with
faces
of
awe
upon
the
wonder
now
as
we
watched
that
kingly
peak
we
saw
the
color
leap
to
one
and
another
and
another
of
the
snowy
summits
around
it
the
monarch
had
a
whole
family
of
royal
princes
about
him
to
share
his
glory
their
radiant
heads
ruby
crowned
were
above
the
clouds
which
seemed
to
form
their
silken
garments
as
we
looked
in
ecstatic
silence
we
saw
the
light
creep
down
the
mountains
it
was
changing
now
the
glowing
crimson
was
suffused
with
soft
creamy
light
if
it
was
less
divine
it
was
more
warmly
human
heaven
was
coming
down
to
man
the
dark
recesses
of
the
mountains
began
to
lighten
they
stood
forth
as
at
the
word
of
command
from
the
master
of
all
and
as
the
changing
mellow
light
moved
downward
that
wonderful
colosseum
appeared
clearly
with
its
battlements
and
peaks
and
columns
until
the
whole
majestic
landscape
was
revealed
now
we
saw
the
design
and
purpose
of
it
all
now
the
text
of
this
great
sermon
was
emblazoned
across
the
landscape
is
and
we
understood
that
these
relentless
forces
that
had
pushed
the
molten
mountains
heavenward
cooled
them
into
granite
peaks
covered
them
with
snow
and
ice
dumped
the
moraine
matter
into
the
sea
filling
up
the
sea
preparing
the
world
for
a
stronger
and
better
race
of
men
who
knows
were
all
a
part
of
that
great
all
things
that
work
together
for
good
our
minds
cleared
with
the
landscape
our
courage
rose
our
indians
dipped
their
paddles
silently
steering
without
fear
amidst
the
dangerous
masses
of
ice
but
there
was
no
profanity
in
exclamation
we
have
met
with
god
a
lifelong
devoutness
of
gratitude
filled
us
to
think
that
we
were
guided
into
this
most
wonderful
room
of
god
great
gallery
on
perhaps
the
only
day
in
the
year
when
the
skies
were
cleared
and
the
sunrise
the
atmospheric
conditions
and
the
point
of
view
all
prepared
for
the
matchless
spectacle
the
discomforts
of
the
voyage
the
toil
the
cold
and
rain
of
the
past
weeks
were
a
small
price
to
pay
for
one
glimpse
of
its
surpassing
loveliness
again
and
again
muir
would
break
out
after
a
long
silence
of
blissful
memory
with
exclamations
we
saw
it
we
saw
it
he
sent
us
to
his
most
glorious
exhibition
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
two
or
three
inspiring
days
followed
muir
must
climb
the
most
accessible
of
the
mountains
my
weak
shoulders
forbade
me
to
ascend
more
than
two
or
three
thousand
feet
but
muir
went
more
than
twice
as
high
upon
two
or
three
of
the
glaciers
he
climbed
although
the
speed
of
these
icy
streams
was
so
great
and
their
frozen
cataracts
were
so
frequent
that
it
was
difficult
to
ascend
them
i
began
to
understand
muir
whole
new
theory
which
theory
made
tyndall
pronounce
him
the
greatest
authority
on
glacial
action
the
world
had
seen
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
mechanical
laws
that
governed
those
resistless
streams
how
they
carved
their
own
valleys
how
the
lower
valley
and
glacier
were
often
the
resultant
in
size
and
velocity
of
the
two
or
three
glaciers
that
now
formed
the
branches
of
the
main
glaciers
how
the
harder
strata
of
rock
resisted
and
turned
the
masses
of
ice
how
the
steely
ploughshares
were
often
inserted
into
softer
leads
and
a
whole
mountain
split
apart
as
by
a
wedge
muir
would
explore
all
day
long
often
rising
hours
before
daylight
and
disappearing
among
the
mountains
not
coming
to
camp
until
after
night
had
fallen
again
and
again
the
indians
said
that
he
was
lost
but
i
had
no
fears
for
him
when
he
would
return
to
camp
he
was
so
full
of
his
discoveries
and
of
the
new
facts
garnered
that
he
would
talk
until
long
into
the
night
almost
forgetting
to
eat
returning
down
the
bay
we
passed
the
largest
glacier
of
all
which
was
to
bear
muir
name
it
was
then
fully
a
mile
and
a
half
in
width
and
the
perpendicular
face
of
it
towered
from
four
to
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
the
ice
masses
were
breaking
off
so
fast
that
we
were
forced
to
put
off
far
from
the
face
of
the
glacier
the
great
waves
threatened
constantly
to
dash
us
against
the
sharp
points
of
the
icebergs
we
wished
to
land
and
scale
the
glacier
from
the
eastern
side
we
rowed
our
canoe
about
half
a
mile
from
the
edge
of
the
glacier
but
attempting
to
land
were
forced
hastily
to
put
off
again
a
great
wave
formed
by
the
masses
of
ice
breaking
off
into
the
water
threatened
to
dash
our
loaded
canoe
against
the
boulders
on
the
beach
rowing
further
away
we
tried
it
again
and
again
with
the
same
result
as
soon
as
we
neared
the
shore
another
huge
wave
would
threaten
destruction
we
were
fully
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
edge
of
the
glacier
before
we
found
it
safe
to
land
illustration
muir
glacier
returning
down
glacier
bay
we
visited
the
largest
glacier
of
all
which
was
to
bear
muir
name
muir
spent
a
whole
day
alone
on
the
glacier
walking
over
twenty
miles
across
what
he
called
the
glacial
lake
between
two
mountains
a
cold
penetrating
rain
was
falling
and
dark
clouds
swept
up
the
bay
and
clung
about
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
when
night
approached
and
muir
had
not
returned
i
set
the
indians
to
digging
out
from
the
bases
of
the
gravel
hills
the
frazzled
stumps
and
logs
that
remained
of
the
buried
forests
these
were
full
of
resin
and
burned
brightly
i
made
a
great
fire
and
cooked
a
good
supper
of
venison
beans
biscuit
and
coffee
when
pitchy
darkness
gathered
and
still
muir
did
not
come
made
some
torches
of
fat
spruce
and
taking
with
him
charley
laden
with
more
wood
he
went
up
the
beach
a
mile
and
a
half
climbed
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
kindled
a
beacon
which
flashed
its
cheering
rays
far
over
the
glacier
muir
came
stumbling
into
camp
with
these
two
indians
a
little
before
midnight
very
tired
but
very
happy
ah
he
sighed
i
glad
to
be
in
camp
the
glacier
almost
got
me
this
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
beacon
and
old
i
might
have
had
to
spend
the
night
on
the
ice
the
crevasses
were
so
many
and
so
bewildering
in
their
mazy
crisscross
windings
that
i
was
actually
going
farther
into
the
glacier
when
i
caught
the
flash
of
light
i
brought
him
to
the
tent
and
placed
the
hot
viands
before
him
he
attacked
them
ravenously
but
presently
was
talking
again
man
man
you
ought
to
have
been
with
me
you
never
make
up
what
you
have
lost
i
been
wandering
through
a
thousand
rooms
of
crystal
temple
i
been
a
thousand
feet
down
in
the
crevasses
with
matchless
domes
and
sculptured
figures
and
carved
all
about
me
solomon
marble
and
ivory
palaces
were
nothing
to
it
such
purity
such
color
such
delicate
beauty
i
was
tempted
to
stay
there
and
feast
my
soul
and
softly
freeze
until
i
would
become
part
of
the
glacier
what
a
great
death
that
would
be
again
and
again
i
would
have
to
remind
muir
that
he
was
eating
his
supper
but
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
i
could
get
him
to
finish
the
meal
and
two
or
three
hours
longer
before
he
stopped
talking
and
went
to
sleep
i
wish
i
had
taken
down
his
descriptions
what
splendid
reading
they
would
make
but
scurries
of
snow
warned
us
that
winter
was
coming
and
much
to
the
relief
of
our
natives
we
turned
the
prow
of
our
canoe
towards
chatham
strait
again
landing
our
hoonah
guide
at
his
village
we
took
our
route
northward
again
up
lynn
canal
the
beautiful
davison
glacier
with
its
great
snowy
fan
drew
our
gaze
and
excited
our
admiration
for
two
days
then
the
visit
to
the
chilcats
and
the
return
trip
commenced
bowling
down
the
canal
before
a
strong
north
wind
we
entered
stevens
passage
and
visited
the
two
villages
of
the
auk
indians
a
squalid
miserable
tribe
we
camped
at
the
site
of
what
is
now
juneau
the
capital
of
alaska
and
no
dream
of
the
millions
of
gold
that
were
to
be
taken
from
those
mountains
disturbed
us
if
we
had
known
i
do
not
think
that
we
would
have
halted
a
day
or
staked
a
claim
our
treasures
were
richer
than
gold
and
securely
laid
up
in
the
vaults
of
our
memories
an
excursion
into
taku
bay
that
miniature
of
glacier
bay
with
its
then
three
living
glaciers
a
visit
to
two
villages
of
the
taku
indians
past
snettisham
up
whose
arms
we
pushed
mapping
them
then
to
sumdum
here
the
two
arms
of
holkham
bay
filled
with
ice
enticed
us
to
exploration
but
the
constant
rains
of
the
fall
had
made
the
ice
of
the
glaciers
more
viscid
and
the
glacier
streams
more
rapid
hence
the
vast
array
of
icebergs
charging
down
upon
us
like
an
army
spreading
out
in
loose
formation
and
then
gathering
into
a
barrier
when
the
tide
turned
made
exploration
to
the
end
of
the
bay
impossible
muir
would
not
give
up
his
quest
of
the
mother
glacier
until
the
indians
frankly
refused
to
go
any
further
and
old
called
our
interpreter
johnny
as
for
a
counsel
of
state
and
carefully
set
forth
to
muir
that
if
he
persisted
in
his
purpose
of
pushing
forward
up
the
bay
he
would
have
the
blood
of
the
whole
party
on
his
hands
said
the
old
chief
my
life
is
of
no
account
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
i
live
or
die
but
you
shall
not
sacrifice
the
life
of
my
minister
i
laughed
at
muir
discomfiture
and
gave
the
word
to
retreat
this
one
defeat
of
a
victorious
expedition
so
weighed
upon
muir
mind
that
it
brought
him
back
from
the
california
coast
next
year
and
from
the
arms
of
his
bride
to
discover
and
climb
upon
that
glacier
on
down
now
through
prince
frederick
sound
past
the
beautiful
norris
glacier
then
into
le
conte
bay
with
its
living
glacier
and
icebergs
across
the
stickeen
flats
and
so
joyfully
home
again
muir
to
take
the
november
steamboat
back
to
his
sunland
i
have
made
many
voyages
in
that
great
alexandrian
archipelago
since
traveling
by
canoe
over
fifteen
thousand
miles
not
one
of
them
a
dull
one
through
its
intricate
passages
but
none
compared
in
the
number
and
intensity
of
its
thrills
in
the
variety
and
excitement
of
its
incidents
and
in
its
lasting
impressions
of
beauty
and
grandeur

john
muir
was
married
in
the
spring
of
to
miss
strentzel
the
daughter
of
a
polish
physician
who
had
come
out
in
the
great
stampede
of
to
california
but
had
found
his
gold
in
oranges
lemons
and
apricots
on
a
great
fruit
ranch
at
martinez
california
a
brief
letter
from
muir
told
of
his
marriage
with
just
one
note
in
it
the
depth
of
joy
and
peace
of
which
i
could
fathom
knowing
him
so
well
then
no
word
of
him
until
the
monthly
mailboat
came
in
september
as
i
stood
on
the
wharf
with
the
rest
of
the
wrangell
population
as
was
the
custom
of
our
isolation
watching
the
boat
come
in
i
was
overjoyed
to
see
john
muir
on
deck
in
that
same
old
long
gray
ulster
and
scotch
cap
he
waved
and
shouted
at
me
before
the
boat
touched
the
wharf
springing
ashore
he
said
when
can
you
be
ready
are
you
a
little
fast
i
replied
what
does
this
mean
your
wife
man
he
exclaimed
have
you
forgotten
do
you
know
we
lost
a
glacier
last
fall
do
you
think
i
could
sleep
soundly
in
my
bed
this
winter
with
that
hanging
on
my
conscience
my
wife
could
not
come
so
i
have
come
alone
and
you
got
to
go
with
me
to
find
the
lost
get
your
canoe
and
crew
and
let
us
be
off
the
ten
months
since
muir
had
left
me
had
not
been
spent
in
idleness
at
wrangell
i
had
made
two
long
voyages
of
discovery
and
missionary
work
on
my
own
account
one
in
the
spring
of
four
hundred
fifty
miles
around
prince
of
wales
island
visiting
the
five
towns
of
hydah
indians
and
the
three
villages
of
the
hanega
tribe
of
thlingets
another
in
the
summer
down
the
coast
to
the
cape
fox
and
tongass
tribes
of
thlingets
and
across
dixon
entrance
to
simpson
where
there
was
a
mission
among
the
tsimpheans
and
on
fifteen
miles
further
to
the
famous
mission
of
father
duncan
at
metlakahtla
i
had
written
accounts
of
these
trips
to
muir
but
for
him
the
greatest
interest
was
in
the
glaciers
and
mountains
of
the
mainland
our
preparations
were
soon
made
alas
we
could
not
have
our
noble
old
captain
this
time
on
the
tenth
of
january
the
darkest
day
of
my
life
this
noblest
roman
of
them
all
fell
dead
at
my
feet
with
a
bullet
through
his
forehead
shot
by
a
member
of
that
same
tribe
where
he
had
preached
the
gospel
of
peace
so
simply
and
eloquently
a
few
months
before
the
maddened
by
the
fiery
liquor
that
bore
their
name
came
to
wrangell
and
a
preliminary
skirmish
led
to
an
attack
at
daylight
of
that
winter
day
upon
the
stickeen
village
old
had
stood
for
peace
and
rather
than
have
any
bloodshed
had
offered
all
his
blankets
as
a
peace
offering
although
in
no
physical
fear
himself
but
when
the
encouraged
by
the
seeming
cowardice
of
the
stickeens
broke
into
their
houses
and
the
christianized
tribe
provoked
beyond
endurance
came
out
with
their
guns
came
forth
armed
only
with
his
old
carved
spear
the
emblem
of
his
position
as
chief
to
see
if
he
could
not
call
his
tribe
back
again
at
my
instance
as
i
stood
with
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
lifted
up
his
voice
to
recall
his
people
to
their
houses
when
in
an
instant
the
volley
commenced
on
both
sides
and
this
christian
man
one
of
the
simplest
and
grandest
souls
i
ever
knew
fell
dead
at
my
feet
and
the
tribe
was
tumbled
back
into
barbarism
and
the
white
man
who
had
taught
the
indians
the
art
of
making
rum
and
the
white
man
government
which
had
afforded
no
safeguard
against
such
scenes
were
responsible
illustration
davidson
glacier
the
beautiful
davidson
glacier
with
its
great
fan
drew
our
gaze
and
excited
our
admiration
for
two
days
muir
mourned
with
me
the
fate
of
this
old
chief
but
another
of
my
men
lot
tyeen
was
ready
with
a
swift
canoe
joe
his
and
billy
dickinson
a
boy
of
seventeen
who
acted
as
interpreter
formed
the
crew
when
we
were
about
to
embark
i
suddenly
thought
of
my
little
dog
stickeen
and
made
the
resolve
to
take
him
along
my
wife
and
muir
both
protested
and
i
almost
yielded
to
their
persuasion
i
shudder
now
to
think
what
the
world
would
have
lost
had
their
arguments
prevailed
that
little
brisk
beautiful
but
very
independent
dog
in
with
muir
genius
was
to
give
to
the
world
one
of
its
greatest
muir
story
of
stickeen
ranks
with
rab
and
his
friends
bob
son
of
battle
and
far
above
the
call
of
the
wild
indeed
in
subtle
analysis
of
dog
character
as
well
as
beauty
of
description
i
think
it
outranks
all
of
them
all
over
the
world
men
women
and
children
are
reading
with
laughter
thrills
and
tears
this
exquisite
little
story
i
have
told
muir
that
in
his
book
he
did
not
do
justice
to
my
beauty
i
think
that
he
was
the
handsomest
dog
i
have
ever
known
his
markings
were
very
much
like
those
of
an
american
shepherd
dog
black
white
and
tan
although
he
was
not
half
the
size
of
one
but
his
hair
was
so
silky
and
so
long
his
tail
so
heavily
fringed
and
beautifully
curved
his
eyes
so
deep
and
expressive
and
his
shape
so
perfect
in
its
graceful
contours
that
i
have
never
seen
another
dog
quite
like
him
otherwise
muir
description
of
him
is
perfect
when
stickeen
was
only
a
round
ball
of
silky
fur
as
big
as
one
fist
he
was
given
as
a
wedding
present
to
my
bride
two
years
before
this
voyage
i
carried
him
in
my
overcoat
pocket
to
and
from
the
steamer
as
we
sailed
from
sitka
to
wrangell
soon
after
we
arrived
a
solemn
delegation
of
stickeen
indians
came
to
call
on
the
bride
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
puppy
they
were
solemn
no
longer
his
gravely
humorous
antics
were
irresistible
it
was
moses
who
named
him
stickeen
after
their
tribe
an
exceptional
honor
thereafter
the
whole
tribe
adopted
and
protected
him
and
woe
to
the
indian
dog
which
molested
him
once
when
i
was
passing
the
house
of
this
same
lot
tyeen
one
of
his
large
hunting
dogs
dashed
out
at
stickeen
and
began
to
worry
him
lot
rescued
the
little
fellow
delivered
him
to
me
and
walked
into
his
house
soon
he
came
out
with
his
gun
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
about
he
had
shot
the
offending
indian
dog
a
valuable
hunting
animal
stickeen
lacked
the
obtrusively
affectionate
manner
of
many
of
his
species
did
not
like
to
be
fussed
over
would
even
growl
when
our
babies
enmeshed
their
hands
in
his
long
hair
and
yet
to
a
degree
i
have
never
known
in
another
dog
he
attracted
the
attention
of
everybody
and
won
all
hearts
as
instances
kendall
the
grand
old
man
of
our
church
during
his
visit
of
used
to
break
away
from
solemn
counsels
with
the
other
and
the
carpenters
to
run
after
and
shout
at
stickeen
and
mcfarland
the
mother
of
protestant
missions
in
alaska
often
begged
us
to
give
her
the
dog
and
when
later
he
was
stolen
from
her
care
by
an
unscrupulous
tourist
and
so
forever
lost
to
us
she
could
hardly
afterwards
speak
of
him
without
tears
stickeen
was
a
born
aristocrat
dainty
and
scrupulously
clean
from
puppyhood
he
never
cared
to
play
with
the
indian
dogs
and
i
was
often
amused
to
see
the
dignified
but
decided
way
in
which
he
repulsed
all
attempts
at
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
indian
children
he
admitted
to
his
friendship
only
a
few
of
the
natives
choosing
those
who
had
adopted
the
white
man
dress
and
mode
of
living
and
were
devoid
of
the
rank
native
odors
his
likes
and
dislikes
were
very
strong
and
always
evident
from
the
moment
of
his
meeting
with
a
stranger
there
was
something
almost
uncanny
about
the
accuracy
of
his
judgment
when
sizing
up
a
man
it
was
stickeen
himself
who
really
decided
the
question
whether
we
should
take
him
with
us
on
this
trip
he
listened
to
the
discussion
pro
and
con
as
he
stood
with
me
on
the
wharf
turning
his
sharp
expressive
eyes
and
sensitive
ears
up
to
me
or
down
to
muir
in
the
canoe
when
the
argument
seemed
to
be
going
against
the
dog
he
suddenly
turned
deliberately
walked
down
the
to
the
canoe
picked
his
steps
carefully
to
the
bow
where
my
seat
with
muir
was
arranged
and
curled
himself
down
on
my
coat
the
discussion
ended
abruptly
in
a
general
laugh
and
stickeen
went
along
then
the
acute
little
fellow
set
about
in
the
wisest
possible
way
to
conquer
muir
he
was
not
obtrusive
never
butted
in
never
offended
by
a
too
affectionate
tongue
he
listened
silently
to
discussions
on
his
merits
those
first
days
but
when
muir
comparisons
of
the
brilliant
dogs
of
his
acquaintance
with
stickeen
grew
too
odious
stickeen
would
rise
yawn
openly
and
retire
to
a
distance
not
slinkingly
but
with
tail
up
and
lie
down
again
out
of
earshot
of
such
calumnies
when
we
landed
after
a
day
journey
stickeen
was
always
the
first
ashore
exploring
for
field
mice
and
squirrels
but
when
we
would
start
to
the
woods
the
mountains
or
the
glaciers
the
dog
would
join
us
coming
mysteriously
from
the
forest
when
our
paths
separated
stickeen
looking
to
me
for
permission
would
follow
muir
trotting
at
first
behind
him
but
gradually
ranging
alongside
after
a
few
days
muir
changed
his
tone
saying
there
more
in
that
wee
beastie
than
i
thought
and
before
a
week
passed
stickeen
victory
was
complete
he
slept
at
muir
feet
went
with
him
on
all
his
rambles
and
even
among
dangerous
crevasses
or
far
up
the
steep
slopes
of
granite
mountains
the
little
dog
splendid
tail
would
be
seen
ahead
of
muir
waving
cheery
signals
to
his
human
companion
our
canoe
was
light
and
easily
propelled
our
outfit
was
very
simple
for
this
was
to
be
a
quick
voyage
and
there
were
not
to
be
so
many
missionary
visits
this
time
it
was
principally
a
voyage
of
discovery
we
were
in
search
of
the
glacier
that
we
had
lost
perched
in
the
high
stern
sat
our
captain
lot
tyeen
massive
and
capable
handling
his
broad
steering
paddle
with
power
and
skill
in
front
of
him
joe
and
billy
pulled
oars
joe
a
strong
young
man
our
cook
hunter
and
best
oarsman
billy
a
lad
of
seventeen
our
interpreter
and
joe
assistant
towards
the
bow
just
behind
the
mast
sat
muir
and
i
each
with
a
paddle
in
his
hands
stickeen
slumbered
at
our
feet
or
gazed
into
our
faces
when
our
conversation
interested
him
when
we
began
to
discuss
a
landing
place
he
would
climb
the
high
bow
and
brace
himself
on
the
top
of
the
beak
an
animated
ready
to
jump
into
the
water
when
we
were
about
to
camp
our
route
was
different
from
that
of
now
we
struck
through
wrangell
narrows
that
tortuous
and
narrow
passage
between
mitkof
and
kupreanof
islands
past
norris
glacier
with
its
shaft
of
ice
appearing
above
the
forests
as
if
suspended
in
air
past
the
bold
pt
windham
with
its
bluff
of
three
thousand
feet
frowning
upon
the
waters
of
prince
frederick
sound
across
port
houghton
whose
deep
fiord
had
no
ice
in
it
and
therefore
was
not
worthy
of
an
extended
visit
we
made
all
haste
for
muir
was
as
the
indians
said
always
hungry
for
ice
and
this
was
more
especially
his
expedition
he
was
the
commander
now
as
i
had
been
the
year
before
he
had
set
for
himself
the
limit
of
a
month
and
must
return
by
the
october
boat
often
we
ran
until
late
at
night
against
the
protests
of
our
indians
whose
life
of
infinite
leisure
was
not
accustomed
to
such
rude
interruption
they
could
not
understand
muir
at
all
nor
in
the
least
comprehend
his
object
in
visiting
icy
bays
where
there
was
no
chance
of
finding
gold
and
nothing
to
hunt
the
vision
rises
before
me
as
my
mind
harks
back
to
this
second
trip
of
seven
hundred
miles
of
cold
rainy
nights
when
urged
by
muir
to
make
one
more
point
the
natives
passed
the
last
favorable
camping
place
and
we
blindly
groped
for
hours
in
pitchy
darkness
trying
to
find
a
friendly
beach
the
intensely
phosphorescent
water
flashed
about
us
the
only
relief
to
the
inky
blackness
of
the
night
occasionally
a
salmon
or
a
big
halibut
disturbed
by
our
canoe
went
streaming
like
a
meteor
through
the
water
throwing
off
coruscations
of
light
as
we
neared
the
shore
the
waves
breaking
upon
the
rocks
furnished
us
the
only
illumination
sometimes
their
black
tops
with
waving
seaweed
surrounded
by
phosphorescent
breakers
would
have
the
appearance
of
mouths
set
with
gleaming
teeth
rushing
at
us
out
of
the
dark
as
if
to
devour
us
then
would
come
the
landing
on
a
sandy
beach
the
march
through
the
seaweed
up
to
the
wet
woods
a
fusillade
of
exploding
fucus
pods
accompanying
us
as
if
the
outraged
fairies
were
bombarding
us
with
tiny
guns
then
would
ensue
a
tedious
groping
with
the
lantern
for
a
camping
place
and
for
some
dry
fat
spruce
wood
from
which
to
coax
a
fire
then
the
big
the
and
the
cheerful
song
and
story
and
the
deep
dreamless
sleep
that
only
the
weary
voyageur
or
hunter
can
know
four
or
five
days
sufficed
to
bring
us
to
our
first
objective
sumdum
or
holkham
bay
with
its
three
wonderful
arms
here
we
were
to
find
the
lost
glacier
this
deep
fiord
has
two
great
prongs
neither
of
them
figured
in
vancouver
chart
and
so
far
as
records
go
we
were
the
first
to
enter
and
follow
to
its
end
the
longest
of
these
endicott
arm
we
entered
the
bay
at
night
caught
again
by
the
darkness
and
groped
our
way
uncertainly
we
probably
would
have
spent
most
of
the
night
trying
to
find
a
landing
place
had
not
the
gleam
of
a
fire
greeted
us
flashing
through
the
trees
disappearing
as
an
island
intervened
and
again
opening
up
with
its
fair
ray
as
we
pushed
on
an
hour
steady
paddling
brought
us
to
the
camp
of
some
cassiar
miners
my
friends
they
were
here
at
the
foot
of
a
glacier
stream
from
the
bed
of
which
they
had
been
sluicing
gold
just
now
they
were
in
hard
luck
as
the
constant
rains
had
swelled
the
glacial
stream
burst
through
their
swept
away
their
and
destroyed
the
work
of
the
summer
strong
men
of
the
wilderness
as
they
were
they
were
not
discouraged
but
were
discussing
plans
for
prospecting
new
places
and
trying
it
again
here
next
summer
hot
coffee
and
fried
venison
emphasized
their
welcome
and
we
in
return
could
give
them
a
little
news
from
the
outside
world
from
which
they
had
been
shut
off
completely
for
months
muir
called
us
before
daylight
the
next
morning
he
had
been
up
since
two
or
three
studying
the
night
effects
he
said
listening
to
the
roaring
and
crunching
of
the
charging
ice
as
it
came
out
of
endicott
arm
spreading
out
like
the
skirmish
line
of
an
army
and
grinding
against
the
rocky
point
just
below
us
he
had
even
attempted
a
moonlight
climb
up
the
sloping
face
of
a
high
promontory
with
stickeen
as
his
companion
but
was
unable
to
get
to
the
top
owing
to
the
smoothness
of
the
granite
rock
it
was
newly
glaciated
this
whole
region
and
the
hard
rubbing
had
polished
the
granite
like
a
monument
a
hasty
meal
and
we
were
off
we
find
it
this
time
said
muir
a
miner
crawled
out
of
his
blankets
and
came
to
see
us
start
if
scenery
you
after
he
said
ten
miles
up
the
bay
there
the
nicest
canyon
you
ever
saw
it
has
no
name
that
i
know
of
but
it
is
sure
some
scenery
the
long
straight
fiord
stretched
southeast
into
the
heart
of
the
granite
range
its
funnel
shape
producing
tremendous
tides
when
the
tide
was
ebbing
that
charging
phalanx
of
ice
was
irresistible
storming
down
the
canyon
with
speed
no
canoe
could
stem
that
current
we
waited
until
the
turn
then
getting
inside
the
outer
fleet
of
icebergs
we
paddled
up
with
the
flood
tide
mile
after
mile
we
raced
past
those
smooth
mountain
shoulders
higher
and
higher
they
towered
and
the
ice
closing
in
upon
us
threatened
a
trap
the
only
way
to
navigate
safely
that
dangerous
fiord
was
to
keep
ahead
of
the
charging
ice
as
we
came
up
towards
the
end
of
the
bay
the
narrowing
walls
of
the
fiord
compressed
the
ice
until
it
crowded
dangerously
around
us
our
captain
lot
had
taken
the
precaution
to
put
a
false
bow
and
stern
on
his
canoe
cunningly
fashioned
out
of
curved
branches
of
trees
and
hollowed
with
his
to
fit
the
ends
of
the
canoe
these
were
lashed
to
the
bow
and
stern
by
thongs
of
deer
sinew
they
were
needed
it
was
like
penetrating
an
arctic
sometimes
we
would
have
to
skirt
the
granite
rock
and
with
our
poles
shove
out
the
to
secure
a
passage
it
was
fully
thirty
miles
to
the
head
of
the
bay
but
we
made
it
in
half
a
day
so
strong
was
the
current
of
the
rising
tide
i
shall
never
forget
the
view
that
burst
upon
us
as
we
rounded
the
last
point
the
face
of
the
glacier
where
it
discharged
its
icebergs
was
very
narrow
in
comparison
with
the
giants
of
glacier
bay
but
the
ice
cliff
was
higher
than
even
the
face
of
muir
glacier
the
narrow
canyon
of
hard
granite
had
compressed
the
ice
of
the
great
glacier
until
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
frozen
torrent
broken
into
innumerable
crevasses
the
great
masses
of
ice
tumbling
over
one
another
and
bulging
out
for
a
few
moments
before
they
came
crashing
and
splashing
down
into
the
deep
water
of
the
bay
the
fiord
was
simply
a
cleft
in
high
mountains
and
the
depth
of
the
water
could
only
be
conjectured
it
must
have
been
hundreds
of
feet
perhaps
thousands
from
the
surface
of
the
water
to
the
bottom
of
that
fissure
smooth
polished
shining
breasts
of
bright
gray
granite
crowded
above
the
glacier
on
every
side
seeming
to
overhang
the
ice
and
the
bay
struggling
clumps
of
evergreens
clung
to
the
mountain
sides
below
the
glacier
and
up
away
up
dizzily
to
the
sky
towered
the
walls
of
the
canyon
hundreds
of
other
alaskan
glaciers
excel
this
in
masses
of
ice
and
in
grandeur
of
front
but
none
that
i
have
seen
condense
beauty
and
grandeur
to
finer
results
what
a
plucky
little
giant
was
muir
exclamation
as
we
stood
on
a
in
front
of
this
glacier
to
think
of
his
shouldering
his
way
through
the
mountain
range
like
this
samson
pushing
down
the
pillars
of
the
temple
at
gaza
was
nothing
to
this
fellow
hear
him
roar
and
laugh
without
consulting
me
muir
named
this
young
glacier
and
right
proud
was
i
to
see
that
name
on
the
charts
for
the
next
ten
years
or
more
for
we
mapped
endicott
arm
and
the
other
arm
of
sumdum
bay
as
we
had
glacier
bay
but
later
maps
have
a
different
name
some
ambitious
young
ensign
on
a
surveying
vessel
perhaps
stole
my
glacier
and
later
charts
give
it
the
name
of
dawes
i
have
not
found
in
the
alaskan
statute
books
any
penalty
attached
to
the
crime
of
stealing
a
glacier
but
certainly
it
ought
to
be
ranked
as
a
felony
of
the
first
magnitude
the
grandest
of
grand
larcenies
a
couple
of
days
and
nights
spent
in
the
vicinity
of
young
glacier
were
a
period
of
unmixed
pleasure
muir
spent
all
of
these
days
and
part
of
the
nights
climbing
the
pinnacled
mountains
to
this
and
that
viewpoint
crossing
the
deep
narrow
and
dangerous
glacier
five
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
exploring
its
tributaries
and
their
side
canyons
making
sketches
in
his
for
future
elaboration
stickeen
by
this
time
constantly
followed
muir
exciting
my
jealousy
by
his
plainly
expressed
preference
because
of
my
bad
shoulder
the
higher
and
steeper
ascents
of
this
very
rugged
region
were
impossible
to
me
and
i
must
content
myself
with
two
thousand
feet
and
even
lesser
climbs
my
favorite
perch
was
on
the
summit
of
a
rock
which
formed
the
point
of
a
promontory
jutting
into
the
bay
directly
in
front
of
my
glacier
and
distant
from
its
face
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
was
a
granite
fragment
which
had
evidently
been
broken
off
from
the
mountain
indeed
there
was
a
niche
five
thousand
feet
above
into
which
it
would
exactly
fit
the
sturdy
evergreens
struggled
up
its
sides
but
the
top
was
bare
on
this
splendid
pillar
i
spent
many
hours
generally
i
could
see
muir
fortunate
in
having
sound
arms
and
legs
scaling
the
high
now
coming
out
on
a
jutting
spur
now
spread
like
a
spider
against
the
mountain
wall
here
he
would
be
botanizing
in
a
patch
of
green
that
relieved
the
gray
of
the
granite
there
he
was
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
blue
crevasses
of
the
upper
glacial
falls
darting
before
him
or
creeping
behind
was
a
little
black
speck
which
i
made
out
to
be
stickeen
climbing
steeps
up
which
a
fox
would
hardly
venture
occasionally
i
would
see
him
dancing
about
at
the
base
of
a
cliff
too
steep
for
him
up
which
muir
was
climbing
and
his
piercing
howls
of
protest
at
being
left
behind
would
come
echoing
down
to
me
but
chiefly
i
was
engrossed
in
the
great
drama
which
was
being
acted
before
me
by
the
glacier
itself
it
was
the
battle
of
gravity
with
flinty
hardness
and
strong
cohesion
the
stage
setting
was
perfect
the
great
hall
formed
by
encircling
mountains
the
side
curtains
of
forest
fold
on
fold
the
gray
and
brown
of
the
mountain
heights
stretching
clear
across
the
glacier
relieved
by
vivid
moss
and
flower
patches
of
yellow
magenta
violet
and
crimson
but
the
face
of
the
glacier
was
so
high
and
rugged
and
the
ice
so
pure
that
it
showed
a
variety
of
blue
and
purple
tints
i
have
never
seen
surpassed
sapphire
turquoise
cobalt
indigo
peacock
shading
at
the
top
into
lilac
and
amethyst
the
base
of
the
next
to
the
water
of
the
bay
resembled
a
great
mass
of
vitriol
while
the
top
where
it
swept
out
of
the
canyon
had
the
curves
and
tints
and
delicate
lines
of
the
iris
illustration
taku
glacier
there
followed
an
excursion
into
taku
bay
that
miniature
of
glacier
bay
with
its
three
living
glaciers
but
the
glacier
front
was
not
still
in
form
and
color
it
was
changing
every
minute
the
descent
was
so
steep
that
the
glacial
rapids
above
the
bay
must
have
flowed
forward
eighty
or
a
hundred
feet
a
day
the
ice
cliff
towering
a
thousand
feet
over
the
water
would
present
a
slight
incline
from
the
perpendicular
inwards
toward
the
canyon
the
face
being
white
from
powdered
ice
the
result
of
the
grinding
descent
of
the
ice
masses
here
and
there
would
be
little
cascades
of
this
fine
ice
spraying
out
as
they
fell
with
glints
of
prismatic
colors
when
the
sunlight
struck
them
as
i
gazed
i
could
see
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
cliff
slowly
moving
forward
until
the
was
vertical
then
foot
by
foot
it
would
be
pushed
out
until
the
upper
edge
overhung
the
water
now
the
outer
part
denuded
of
the
ice
powder
would
present
a
face
of
delicate
blue
with
darker
shades
where
the
mountain
peaks
cast
their
shadows
suddenly
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
ice
cliff
two
deep
lines
of
prussian
blue
appeared
they
were
crevasses
made
by
the
ice
current
flowing
more
rapidly
in
the
center
of
the
stream
fascinated
i
watched
this
great
pyramid
of
onyx
lean
forward
until
it
became
a
tower
of
pisa
with
fragments
falling
thick
and
fast
from
its
upper
apex
and
from
the
cliffs
out
of
which
it
had
been
split
breathless
and
anxious
i
awaited
the
final
catastrophe
and
its
long
delay
became
almost
a
greater
strain
than
i
could
bear
i
jumped
up
and
down
and
waved
my
arms
and
shouted
at
the
glacier
to
hurry
up
suddenly
the
climax
came
in
a
surprising
way
the
great
tower
of
crystal
shot
up
into
the
air
two
hundred
feet
or
more
impelled
by
the
pressure
of
a
hundred
fathoms
of
water
and
then
toppling
over
came
crashing
into
the
water
with
a
roar
as
of
rending
mountains
its
weight
of
thousands
of
tons
falling
from
such
a
height
splashed
great
sheets
of
water
high
into
the
air
and
a
rainbow
of
wondrous
brilliance
flashed
and
vanished
a
mighty
wave
swept
majestically
down
the
bay
rocking
the
massive
bergs
like
corks
and
breaking
against
my
granite
pillar
tossed
its
spray
up
to
my
lofty
perch
muir
shout
of
applause
and
stickeen
sharp
bark
came
faintly
to
my
ears
when
the
deep
rumbling
of
the
newly
formed
icebergs
had
subsided
that
night
i
waited
supper
long
for
muir
it
was
a
good
supper
a
mulligan
stew
of
mallard
duck
with
biscuits
and
coffee
stickeen
romped
into
camp
about
ten
and
his
new
master
soon
followed
ah
sighed
muir
between
sips
of
coffee
what
a
lord
mercy
it
is
that
we
lost
this
glacier
last
fall
when
we
were
pressed
for
time
to
find
it
again
in
these
glorious
days
that
have
flashed
out
of
the
mists
for
our
special
delectation
this
has
been
a
day
of
days
i
have
found
four
new
varieties
of
moss
and
have
learned
many
new
and
wonderful
facts
about
and
then
the
wonder
and
glory
why
all
the
values
of
beauty
and
sublimity
form
color
motion
and
sound
have
been
present
at
their
very
best
my
friend
we
are
the
richest
men
in
all
the
world
charging
down
the
canyon
with
the
charging
ice
on
our
return
we
kept
to
the
shore
on
the
watch
for
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
of
some
scenery
we
had
not
been
able
to
discover
it
from
the
other
side
as
we
ascended
the
fiord
we
were
almost
swept
past
the
mouth
of
it
by
the
force
of
the
current
paddling
into
an
eddy
we
were
suddenly
halted
as
if
by
a
strong
hand
pushed
against
the
bow
for
the
current
was
flowing
like
a
cataract
out
of
the
narrow
mouth
of
this
side
canyon
a
rocky
shelf
afforded
us
a
landing
place
we
hastily
unloaded
the
canoe
and
pulled
it
up
upon
the
beach
out
of
reach
of
the
floating
ice
and
there
we
had
to
wait
until
the
next
morning
before
we
could
penetrate
the
depths
of
this
great
canyon
we
shot
through
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
at
dangerous
speed
indeed
we
could
not
do
otherwise
we
were
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
the
torrent
at
certain
stages
the
surging
tide
forms
an
actual
fall
for
the
entrance
is
so
narrow
that
the
water
heaps
up
and
pours
over
we
took
the
beginning
of
the
flood
tide
and
so
escaped
that
danger
but
our
speed
must
have
been
at
the
narrows
twenty
miles
an
hour
then
suddenly
the
bay
widened
out
the
water
ceased
to
swirl
and
boil
and
the
current
became
gentle
when
we
could
lay
aside
our
paddles
and
look
up
one
of
the
most
glorious
views
of
the
whole
world
smote
us
in
the
face
and
chant
arose
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
before
entering
this
bay
i
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
yosemite
valley
now
muir
said
there
is
your
yosemite
only
this
one
is
on
much
the
grander
scale
yonder
towers
el
capitan
grown
to
twice
his
natural
size
there
are
the
sentinel
and
the
majestic
dome
and
see
all
the
falls
those
three
have
some
resemblance
to
yosemite
falls
nevada
and
bridal
veil
but
the
mountain
breasts
from
which
they
leap
are
much
higher
than
in
yosemite
and
the
sheer
drop
much
greater
and
there
are
so
many
more
of
these
and
they
fall
into
the
sea
we
call
this
yosemite
bay
a
bigger
yosemite
as
alaska
is
bigger
than
california
two
very
beautiful
glaciers
lay
at
the
head
of
this
canyon
they
did
not
descend
to
the
water
but
the
narrow
strip
of
moraine
matter
without
vegetation
upon
it
between
the
glaciers
and
the
bay
showed
that
it
had
not
been
long
since
they
were
glaciers
of
the
first
class
sending
out
a
stream
of
icebergs
to
join
those
from
the
young
glacier
these
glaciers
stretched
away
miles
and
miles
like
two
great
antennæ
from
the
head
of
the
bay
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
range
but
the
most
striking
features
of
this
scene
were
the
wonderfully
rounded
and
polished
granite
breasts
of
these
great
heights
in
one
stretch
of
about
a
mile
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
bay
parallel
mouldings
like
massive
cornices
of
gray
granite
five
or
six
thousand
feet
high
overhung
the
water
these
had
been
fluted
and
rounded
and
polished
by
the
glacier
stream
until
they
seemed
like
the
upper
walls
and
corinthian
capitals
of
a
great
temple
the
power
of
the
ice
stream
could
be
seen
in
the
striated
shoulders
of
these
cliffs
what
awful
force
that
tool
of
ice
must
have
possessed
driven
by
millions
of
tons
of
weight
to
mould
and
shape
and
scoop
out
these
flinty
rock
faces
as
the
carpenter
forming
plane
flutes
a
board
when
we
were
up
this
wonderful
bay
the
sun
burst
through
a
rift
of
cloud
look
look
exclaimed
muir
nature
is
turning
on
the
colored
lights
in
her
great
show
house
instantly
this
severe
bare
hall
of
polished
rock
was
transformed
into
a
fairy
palace
a
score
of
cascades
the
most
of
them
invisible
before
leapt
into
view
falling
from
the
dizzy
mountain
heights
and
spraying
into
misty
veils
as
they
descended
and
from
all
of
them
flashed
rainbows
of
marvelous
distinctness
and
brilliance
waving
and
dancing
a
very
riot
of
color
the
tinkling
water
falling
into
the
bay
waked
a
thousand
echoes
weird
musical
and
sweet
a
riot
of
sound
it
was
an
enchanted
palace
and
we
left
it
with
reluctance
remaining
only
six
hours
and
going
out
at
the
turn
of
the
flood
tide
to
escape
the
dangerous
rapids
had
there
not
been
any
so
many
things
to
see
beyond
and
so
little
time
in
which
to
see
them
i
doubt
if
muir
would
have
quit
yosemite
bay
for
days
the
dog
and
the
man
my
friends
two
friends
i
have
and
close
akin
are
they
for
both
are
free
and
wild
and
proud
full
of
the
ecstasy
of
life
untrammeled
living
day
by
day
a
law
unto
themselves
yet
breaking
none
of
nature
perfect
code
and
far
afield
remote
from
man
abode
they
roam
the
wilds
together
two
as
one
yet
one
a
dog
a
wisp
of
silky
hair
two
sharp
black
eyes
a
face
alert
mysterious
and
wise
a
shadowy
tail
a
body
lithe
and
fair
and
one
a
man
of
nature
work
the
best
a
heart
of
gold
a
mind
stored
full
of
treasures
new
and
old
of
men
the
greatest
strongest
tenderest
they
love
each
other
these
two
friends
of
mine
yet
both
agree
in
this
with
that
pure
love
that
half
divine
they
both
love
me
vi
the
dog
and
the
man
there
is
no
time
to
tell
of
all
the
bays
we
explored
of
holkham
bay
port
snettisham
tahkou
harbor
all
of
which
we
rudely
put
on
the
map
or
at
least
extended
the
arms
beyond
what
was
previously
known
through
gastineau
channel
now
famous
for
some
of
the
greatest
quartz
mines
and
mills
in
the
world
we
pushed
camping
on
the
site
of
what
is
now
juneau
the
capital
city
of
alaska
an
interesting
bit
of
history
is
to
be
recorded
here
pushing
across
the
flats
at
the
head
of
the
bay
at
high
tide
the
next
morning
for
the
narrow
flat
between
gastineau
channel
and
stevens
passage
can
only
be
crossed
with
canoes
at
flood
tide
we
met
two
old
gold
prospectors
whom
i
had
frequently
seen
at
wrangell
joe
harris
and
joe
juneau
exchanging
greetings
and
news
they
told
us
they
were
out
from
sitka
on
a
leisurely
hunting
and
prospecting
trip
asking
us
about
our
last
camping
place
harris
said
to
juneau
suppose
we
camp
there
and
try
the
gravel
of
that
creek
these
men
found
placer
gold
and
rock
float
at
our
camp
and
made
quite
a
that
fall
returning
to
sitka
with
a
sufficiently
plethoric
to
start
a
stampede
to
the
new
diggings
both
placer
and
quartz
locations
were
made
and
a
brisk
camp
was
built
the
next
summer
this
town
was
first
called
harrisburg
for
one
of
the
prospectors
and
afterwards
juneau
for
the
other
the
great
treadwell
gold
quartz
mine
was
located
three
miles
from
juneau
in
and
others
subsequently
the
territorial
capital
was
later
removed
from
sitka
to
juneau
and
the
city
has
grown
in
size
and
importance
until
it
is
one
of
the
great
mining
and
commercial
centers
of
the
northwest
through
stevens
passage
we
paddled
stopping
to
preach
to
the
auk
indians
then
down
chatham
strait
and
into
icy
strait
where
the
crystal
masses
of
muir
and
pacific
glaciers
flashed
a
greeting
from
afar
we
needed
no
hoonah
guide
this
time
and
it
was
well
we
did
not
for
both
hoonah
villages
were
deserted
the
inhabitants
had
gone
to
their
hunting
fishing
or
grounds
at
pleasant
island
we
loaded
as
on
the
previous
trip
with
dry
wood
for
our
voyage
into
glacier
bay
we
were
not
to
attempt
the
head
of
the
bay
this
time
but
to
confine
our
exploration
to
muir
glacier
which
we
had
only
touched
upon
the
previous
fall
pleasant
island
was
the
scene
of
one
of
stickeen
many
escapades
the
little
island
fairly
teemed
with
big
field
mice
and
pine
squirrels
and
stickeen
went
wild
we
could
hear
his
shrill
bark
now
here
now
there
from
all
parts
of
the
island
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
the
next
morning
he
was
not
to
be
seen
we
got
aboard
as
usual
thinking
that
he
would
follow
a
quarter
of
a
paddling
and
still
no
little
black
head
could
be
discovered
in
our
wake
muir
who
was
becoming
very
much
attached
to
the
little
dog
was
plainly
worried
row
back
he
said
so
we
rowed
back
and
called
but
no
stickeen
around
the
next
point
we
rowed
and
whistled
still
no
stickeen
at
last
discouraged
i
gave
the
signal
to
move
off
so
we
rounded
the
curving
shore
and
pushed
towards
glacier
bay
at
the
far
point
of
the
island
a
mile
from
our
camping
place
we
suddenly
discovered
stickeen
away
out
in
the
water
paddling
calmly
and
confidently
towards
our
canoe
how
he
had
ever
got
there
i
can
not
imagine
i
think
he
must
have
been
taking
a
long
swim
out
on
the
bay
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
it
muir
always
insisted
that
he
had
listened
to
our
discussion
of
the
route
to
be
taken
and
with
an
uncanny
intuition
that
approached
clairvoyance
knew
just
where
to
head
us
off
when
we
took
him
aboard
he
went
through
his
usual
performance
making
his
way
the
whole
length
of
the
canoe
until
he
got
under
muir
legs
before
shaking
himself
no
protests
or
discipline
availed
for
kicks
always
failed
of
their
pretended
mark
to
the
end
of
his
acquaintance
with
muir
he
always
chose
the
vicinity
of
muir
legs
as
the
place
to
shake
himself
after
a
swim
at
muir
glacier
we
spent
a
week
this
time
making
long
trips
up
the
mountains
that
overlooked
the
glacier
and
across
its
surface
on
one
occasion
muir
with
the
little
dog
at
his
heels
crossed
entirely
in
a
diagonal
direction
the
great
glacial
lake
a
trip
of
some
thirty
miles
starting
before
daylight
in
the
morning
and
not
appearing
at
camp
until
long
after
dark
muir
always
carried
several
handkerchiefs
in
his
pockets
but
this
time
he
returned
without
any
having
used
them
all
up
making
moccasins
for
stickeen
whose
feet
were
cut
and
bleeding
from
the
sharp
honeycomb
ice
of
the
glacial
surface
this
mass
of
ice
is
so
vast
and
so
comparatively
still
that
it
has
but
few
crevasses
and
muir
day
for
traversing
it
was
a
perfect
one
warm
and
sunny
illustration
the
front
of
muir
glacier
we
could
understand
the
constant
breaking
off
and
leaping
up
and
smashing
down
of
the
ice
and
the
formation
of
the
great
mass
of
bergs
another
day
he
and
i
climbed
the
mountain
that
overlooked
it
and
skirted
the
mighty
for
some
distance
then
walked
across
the
face
of
the
glacier
just
back
of
the
rapids
keeping
away
from
the
deep
crevasses
we
drove
a
straight
line
of
stakes
across
the
glacial
stream
and
visited
them
each
day
to
watch
the
deflection
and
curves
of
the
stakes
and
thus
arrive
at
some
conception
of
the
rate
at
which
the
ice
mass
was
moving
in
some
parts
of
the
glacial
stream
this
ice
current
flowed
as
fast
as
fifty
or
sixty
feet
a
day
and
we
could
understand
the
constant
breaking
off
and
leaping
up
and
smashing
down
of
the
ice
and
the
formation
of
that
great
mass
of
bergs
shortly
before
we
left
muir
glacier
i
saw
muir
furiously
angry
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
acquaintance
with
him
we
had
noticed
day
after
day
whenever
the
mists
admitted
a
view
of
the
mountain
slopes
bands
of
mountain
goats
looking
like
little
white
mice
against
the
green
of
the
high
pastures
i
said
to
joe
the
hunter
one
morning
go
up
and
get
us
a
kid
it
will
be
a
great
addition
to
our
larder
he
took
my
rifle
and
went
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
with
a
fine
young
buck
on
his
shoulders
while
we
were
examining
it
he
said
i
picked
the
fattest
and
most
tender
of
those
that
i
killed
what
i
exclaimed
did
you
kill
more
than
this
one
he
put
up
both
hands
with
fingers
extended
and
then
one
finger
eleven
he
replied
muir
face
flushed
red
and
with
an
exclamation
that
was
as
near
to
an
oath
as
he
ever
came
he
started
for
joe
luckily
for
that
indian
he
saw
muir
and
fled
like
a
deer
up
the
rocks
and
would
not
come
down
until
he
was
assured
that
he
would
not
be
hurt
i
shared
muir
indignation
and
would
have
enjoyed
seeing
him
administer
the
richly
deserved
thrashing
muir
had
a
strong
aversion
to
taking
the
life
of
any
animal
although
he
would
eat
meat
when
prepared
he
never
killed
a
wild
animal
even
the
rattlesnakes
he
did
not
molest
during
his
rambles
in
california
often
his
softness
of
heart
was
a
source
of
some
annoyance
and
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
to
our
natives
for
he
would
take
pleasure
in
rocking
the
canoe
when
they
were
trying
to
get
a
bead
on
a
flock
of
ducks
or
a
deer
standing
on
the
shore
on
leaving
the
mouth
of
glacier
bay
we
spent
a
week
or
more
exploring
the
inlets
and
glaciers
to
the
west
these
days
were
rainy
and
cold
we
groped
blindly
into
unknown
unmapped
fiords
and
bayous
exploring
them
to
their
ends
and
often
making
excursions
to
the
glaciers
above
them
the
climax
of
the
trip
however
was
the
last
glacier
we
visited
taylor
glacier
the
scene
of
muir
great
adventure
with
stickeen
we
reached
this
fine
glacier
in
the
afternoon
of
a
very
stormy
day
we
were
approaching
the
open
pacific
and
the
the
southeast
was
howling
through
the
narrow
entrance
into
cross
sound
for
twenty
miles
we
had
been
facing
strong
head
winds
and
tidal
waves
as
we
crept
around
rocky
points
and
along
the
bases
of
dizzy
cliffs
and
we
were
drenched
to
the
skin
indeed
our
clothing
and
blankets
had
been
soaking
wet
for
days
for
two
hours
before
we
turned
the
point
into
the
cozy
harbor
in
front
of
the
glacier
we
had
been
exerting
every
ounce
of
our
strength
lot
in
the
stern
wielding
his
big
steering
paddle
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
grunting
with
each
mighty
stroke
calling
encouragement
to
his
crew
hlitsin
pull
pull
strong
with
strength
joe
and
billy
rising
from
their
seats
with
every
stroke
and
throwing
their
whole
weight
and
force
savagely
into
their
oars
muir
and
i
in
the
bow
bent
forward
with
heads
down
butting
into
the
slashing
rain
paddling
for
dear
life
stickeen
the
only
idle
one
looking
over
the
side
of
the
boat
as
though
searching
the
channel
and
then
around
at
us
as
if
he
would
like
to
help
all
except
the
dog
were
exhausted
when
we
turned
into
the
sheltered
cove
while
the
men
pitched
the
tents
and
made
camp
muir
and
i
walked
through
the
thick
grass
to
the
front
of
the
large
glacier
which
front
stretched
from
a
high
perpendicular
rock
wall
about
three
miles
to
a
narrow
promontory
of
moraine
boulders
next
to
the
ocean
now
here
is
something
new
exclaimed
muir
as
we
stood
close
to
the
edge
of
the
ice
this
glacier
is
the
great
exception
all
the
others
of
this
region
are
receding
this
has
been
coming
forward
see
the
mighty
ploughshare
and
its
furrow
for
the
icy
mass
was
heaving
up
the
ground
clear
across
its
front
and
on
the
side
where
we
stood
had
evidently
found
a
softer
stratum
under
a
hill
and
inserted
its
shovel
point
under
the
hill
heaved
it
upon
the
ice
cracking
the
rocks
into
a
thousand
fragments
and
was
carrying
the
whole
hill
upon
its
back
towards
the
sea
the
large
trees
were
leaning
at
all
angles
some
of
them
submerged
splintered
and
ground
by
the
crystal
torrent
some
of
the
shattered
trunks
sticking
out
of
the
ice
it
was
one
of
the
most
tremendous
examples
of
glacial
power
i
have
ever
seen
i
must
climb
this
glacier
said
muir
i
shall
have
a
great
day
of
it
i
wish
you
could
come
along
i
sighed
not
with
resignation
but
with
a
grief
that
was
akin
to
despair
the
condition
of
my
shoulders
was
such
that
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
to
join
muir
on
his
longer
and
more
perilous
climbs
i
should
only
spoil
his
day
and
endanger
his
life
as
well
as
my
own
that
night
i
baked
a
good
batch
of
camp
bread
boiled
a
fresh
kettle
of
beans
and
roasted
a
leg
of
venison
ready
for
muir
breakfast
fixed
the
and
prepared
dry
kindling
for
the
fire
i
knew
he
would
be
up
and
off
at
daybreak
perhaps
long
before
wake
me
up
i
admonished
him
or
at
least
take
time
to
make
hot
coffee
before
you
start
for
the
wind
was
rising
and
the
rain
pouring
and
i
knew
how
imperative
the
call
of
such
a
morning
as
was
promised
would
be
to
him
to
traverse
a
great
new
living
rapidly
moving
glacier
would
be
high
joy
but
to
have
a
tremendous
storm
added
to
this
would
simply
drive
muir
wild
with
desire
to
be
himself
a
part
of
the
great
drama
played
on
the
several
times
during
the
night
i
was
awakened
by
the
flapping
of
the
tent
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
in
the
and
the
thundering
of
the
ocean
surf
on
the
outer
barrier
of
rocks
the
tremulous
howling
of
a
persistent
wolf
across
the
bay
soothed
me
to
sleep
again
and
i
did
not
wake
when
muir
arose
as
i
had
feared
he
was
in
too
big
a
hurry
to
take
time
for
breakfast
but
pocketed
a
small
cake
of
camp
bread
and
hastened
out
into
the
woods
i
was
aroused
however
by
the
controversy
between
him
and
stickeen
outside
of
the
tent
the
little
dog
who
always
slept
with
one
eye
and
ear
alert
for
muir
movements
had
as
usual
quietly
left
his
warm
nest
and
followed
his
adopted
master
muir
was
scolding
and
expostulating
with
him
as
if
he
were
a
boy
i
chuckled
to
myself
at
the
futility
of
muir
efforts
stickeen
would
now
as
always
do
just
as
he
pleased
and
he
would
please
to
go
along
although
i
was
forced
to
stay
at
the
camp
this
stormy
day
was
a
most
interesting
one
to
me
there
was
an
old
hoonah
chief
camped
at
the
mouth
of
the
little
river
which
flowed
from
under
taylor
glacier
he
had
with
him
his
three
wives
and
a
little
company
of
children
and
grandchildren
the
many
salmon
weirs
and
summer
houses
at
this
point
showed
that
it
had
been
at
one
time
a
very
important
fishing
place
but
the
advancing
glacier
had
played
havoc
with
the
chief
salmon
stream
the
icy
mass
had
been
for
several
years
traveling
towards
the
sea
at
the
rate
of
at
least
a
mile
every
year
there
were
still
silver
hordes
of
fine
red
salmon
swimming
in
the
sea
outside
of
the
mouth
but
the
stream
was
now
so
short
that
the
most
of
these
salmon
swam
a
little
ways
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
then
out
into
the
salt
water
again
bewildered
and
circling
about
doubtless
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
parent
stream
the
old
chief
came
to
our
camp
early
followed
by
his
squaws
bearing
gifts
of
salmon
porpoise
meat
clams
and
crabs
and
at
his
command
two
of
the
girls
of
his
family
picked
me
a
basketful
of
delicious
wild
strawberries
he
sat
motionless
by
my
fire
all
the
forenoon
smoking
my
leaf
tobacco
and
pondering
deeply
after
the
noon
meal
which
i
shared
with
him
he
called
billy
my
interpreter
and
asked
for
a
big
talk
with
all
ceremony
i
made
preparations
gave
more
presents
of
leaf
tobacco
and
hardtack
and
composed
myself
for
the
palaver
after
the
usual
preliminaries
in
which
he
told
me
at
great
length
what
a
great
man
i
was
how
like
a
father
to
all
the
people
comparing
me
to
sun
moon
stars
and
all
other
great
things
i
broke
in
upon
his
stream
of
compliments
and
asked
what
he
wanted
recalled
to
earth
he
said
i
wish
you
to
pray
to
your
god
for
what
do
you
wish
me
to
pray
i
asked
the
old
man
raised
his
blanketed
form
to
its
full
height
and
waved
his
hand
with
a
magnificent
gesture
towards
the
glacier
do
you
see
that
great
ice
mountain
yes
once
he
said
i
had
the
finest
salmon
stream
upon
the
coast
pointing
to
a
point
of
rock
five
or
six
miles
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
glacier
he
continued
once
the
salmon
stream
extended
far
beyond
that
point
of
rock
there
was
a
great
fall
there
and
a
deep
pool
below
it
and
here
for
years
great
schools
of
king
salmon
came
crowding
up
to
the
foot
of
that
fall
to
spear
them
or
net
them
was
very
easy
they
were
the
fattest
and
best
salmon
among
all
these
islands
my
household
had
abundance
of
meat
for
the
winter
need
but
the
cruel
spirit
of
that
glacier
grew
angry
with
me
i
know
not
why
and
drove
the
ice
mountain
down
towards
the
sea
and
spoiled
my
salmon
stream
a
year
or
two
more
and
it
will
be
blotted
out
entirely
i
have
done
my
best
i
have
prayed
to
my
gods
last
spring
i
sacrificed
two
of
my
slaves
members
of
my
household
my
best
slaves
a
strong
man
and
his
wife
to
the
spirit
of
that
glacier
to
make
the
ice
mountain
stop
but
it
comes
on
and
now
i
want
you
to
pray
to
god
the
god
of
the
white
man
to
see
if
he
will
make
the
glacier
stop
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
pathetic
earnestness
of
this
old
indian
the
simplicity
with
which
he
told
of
the
sacrifice
of
his
slaves
and
the
eager
look
with
which
he
awaited
my
answer
when
i
exclaimed
in
horror
at
his
deed
of
blood
he
was
astonished
he
could
not
understand
why
they
were
slaves
he
said
and
the
man
suggested
it
himself
he
was
glad
to
go
to
death
to
help
his
chief
a
few
years
after
this
our
missionary
at
hoonah
had
the
pleasure
of
baptizing
this
old
chief
into
the
christian
faith
he
had
put
away
his
slaves
and
his
plural
wives
had
surrendered
the
implements
of
his
old
superstition
and
as
a
child
embraced
the
new
gospel
of
peace
and
love
he
could
not
get
rid
of
his
superstition
about
the
glacier
however
and
about
eight
years
afterwards
visiting
at
wrangell
he
told
me
as
an
item
of
news
which
he
expected
would
greatly
please
me
that
doubtless
as
a
result
of
my
prayers
taylor
glacier
was
receding
again
and
the
salmon
beginning
to
come
into
that
stream
at
intervals
during
this
eventful
day
i
went
to
the
face
of
the
glacier
and
even
climbed
the
disintegrating
hill
that
was
riding
on
the
glacier
ploughshare
in
an
effort
to
see
the
bold
wanderers
but
the
jagged
ice
peaks
of
the
high
glacial
rapids
blocked
my
vision
and
the
rain
driving
passionately
in
horizontal
sheets
shut
out
the
mountains
and
the
upper
plateau
of
ice
i
could
see
that
it
was
snowing
on
the
glacier
and
imagined
the
weariness
and
peril
of
dog
and
man
exposed
to
the
storm
in
that
dangerous
region
i
could
only
hope
that
muir
had
not
ventured
to
face
the
wind
on
the
glacier
but
had
contented
himself
with
tracing
its
eastern
side
and
was
somewhere
in
the
woods
bordering
it
beside
a
big
fire
studying
storm
and
glacier
in
comparative
safety
when
the
shadows
of
evening
were
added
to
those
of
the
storm
i
had
my
men
gather
materials
for
a
big
bonfire
and
kindle
it
well
out
on
the
flat
where
it
could
be
seen
from
mountain
and
glacier
i
placed
dry
clothing
and
blankets
in
the
fly
tent
facing
the
and
got
ready
the
best
supper
at
my
command
clam
chowder
fried
porpoise
bacon
and
beans
savory
meat
made
of
mountain
kid
with
potatoes
onions
rice
and
curry
camp
biscuit
and
coffee
with
dessert
of
wild
strawberries
and
condensed
milk
it
grew
before
seven
and
it
was
after
ten
when
the
dear
wanderers
staggered
into
camp
out
of
the
dripping
forest
stickeen
did
not
bounce
in
ahead
with
a
bark
as
was
his
custom
but
crept
silently
to
his
piece
of
blanket
and
curled
down
too
tired
to
shake
himself
billy
and
i
laid
hands
on
muir
without
a
word
and
in
a
trice
he
was
stripped
of
his
wet
garments
rubbed
dry
clothed
in
dry
underwear
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
set
down
on
a
bed
of
spruce
twigs
with
a
plate
of
hot
chowder
before
him
when
the
chowder
disappeared
the
other
hot
dishes
followed
in
quick
succession
without
a
question
asked
or
a
word
uttered
lot
kept
the
fire
blazing
just
right
joe
kept
the
victuals
hot
and
baked
fresh
bread
while
billy
and
i
waited
on
muir
not
till
he
came
to
the
coffee
and
strawberries
did
muir
break
the
silence
yon
a
brave
doggie
he
said
stickeen
who
could
not
yet
be
induced
to
eat
responded
by
a
glance
of
one
eye
and
a
feeble
pounding
of
the
blanket
with
his
heavy
tail
then
muir
began
to
talk
and
little
by
little
between
sips
of
coffee
the
story
of
the
day
was
unfolded
soon
memories
crowded
for
utterance
and
i
listened
till
midnight
entranced
by
a
succession
of
vivid
descriptions
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
heard
before
or
since
the
fierce
music
and
grandeur
of
the
storm
the
expanse
of
ice
with
its
bewildering
crevasses
its
mysterious
contortions
its
solemn
voices
were
made
to
live
before
me
illustration
glacial
crevasses
we
had
to
make
long
narrow
tacks
and
doublings
tracing
the
edges
of
tremendous
transverse
and
longitudinal
crevasses
beautiful
and
awful
when
muir
described
his
marooning
on
the
narrow
island
of
ice
surrounded
by
fathomless
crevasses
with
a
sliver
curving
deeply
like
the
cable
of
a
suspension
bridge
diagonally
across
it
as
the
only
means
of
escape
i
shuddered
at
his
peril
i
held
my
breath
as
he
told
of
the
terrible
risks
he
ran
as
he
cut
his
steps
down
the
wall
of
ice
to
the
bridge
end
knocked
off
the
sharp
edge
of
the
sliver
hitched
across
inch
by
inch
and
climbed
the
still
more
difficult
ascent
on
the
other
side
but
when
he
told
of
stickeen
cries
of
despair
at
being
left
on
the
other
side
of
the
crevasse
of
his
heroic
determination
at
last
to
do
or
die
of
his
careful
progress
across
the
sliver
as
he
braced
himself
against
the
gusts
and
dug
his
little
claws
into
the
ice
and
of
his
passionate
revulsion
to
the
heights
of
exultation
when
intoxicated
by
his
escape
he
became
a
living
whirlwind
of
joy
flashing
about
in
mad
gyrations
shouting
and
screaming
saved
saved
my
tears
streamed
down
my
face
before
the
close
of
the
story
stickeen
arose
stepped
slowly
across
to
muir
and
crouched
down
with
his
head
on
muir
foot
gazing
into
his
face
and
murmuring
soft
canine
words
of
adoration
to
his
god
not
until
seventeen
years
after
the
event
did
muir
give
to
the
public
his
story
of
stickeen
how
many
times
he
had
written
and
rewritten
it
i
know
not
he
told
me
at
the
time
of
its
first
publication
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
story
all
of
these
years
and
jotting
down
paragraphs
and
sentences
as
they
occurred
to
him
he
was
never
satisfied
with
a
sentence
until
it
balanced
well
he
had
the
keenest
sense
of
melody
as
well
as
of
harmony
in
his
sentence
structure
and
this
great
of
his
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
growth
to
perfection
of
the
great
production
of
a
great
master
the
wonderful
power
of
endurance
of
this
man
whom
theodore
roosevelt
has
well
called
a
perfectly
natural
man
is
instanced
by
the
fact
that
although
he
was
gone
about
seventeen
hours
on
this
day
of
his
adventure
with
stickeen
with
only
a
bite
of
bread
to
eat
and
never
rested
a
minute
of
that
time
but
was
battling
with
the
storm
all
day
and
often
racing
at
full
speed
across
the
glacier
yet
he
got
up
at
daylight
the
next
morning
breakfasted
with
me
and
was
gone
all
day
again
with
stickeen
at
his
heels
climbing
a
high
mountain
to
get
a
view
of
the
snow
fountains
and
upper
reaches
of
the
glacier
and
when
he
returned
after
nightfall
he
worked
for
two
or
three
hours
at
his
notes
and
sketches
the
latter
part
of
this
voyage
was
hurried
muir
had
a
wife
waiting
for
him
at
home
and
he
had
promised
to
stay
in
alaska
only
one
month
he
had
dallied
so
long
with
his
icy
loves
the
glaciers
that
we
were
obliged
to
make
all
haste
to
sitka
where
he
expected
to
take
the
return
steamer
to
miss
that
would
condemn
him
to
alaska
and
absence
from
his
wife
for
another
month
through
a
continually
pouring
rain
we
sailed
by
the
then
deserted
town
of
hoonah
ascended
with
the
rising
tide
a
long
narrow
shallow
inlet
dragged
our
canoe
a
hundred
yards
over
a
little
hill
and
then
descended
with
the
receding
tide
another
long
narrow
passage
down
to
chatham
strait
and
so
on
to
the
mouth
of
peril
strait
which
divided
baranof
from
chichagof
island
on
the
other
side
of
chatham
strait
opposite
the
mouth
of
peril
we
visited
again
angoon
the
village
of
the
from
this
town
the
painted
and
drunken
warriors
had
come
the
winter
before
and
attacked
the
stickeens
killing
old
moses
and
another
of
our
christian
indians
the
trouble
was
not
settled
yet
and
although
the
two
tribes
had
exchanged
some
pledges
and
promised
to
fight
no
more
i
feared
a
fresh
outbreak
and
so
thought
it
wise
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
as
we
approached
angoon
however
i
heard
the
beating
with
their
peculiar
cadence
a
beat
off
as
we
came
up
to
the
beach
i
saw
what
was
seemingly
the
whole
tribe
dancing
their
arrayed
in
their
with
their
fantastic
on
so
earnestly
engaged
were
they
in
their
dance
that
they
at
first
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
me
my
heart
sank
into
my
boots
they
are
going
back
to
wrangell
to
attack
the
stickeens
i
thought
and
there
will
be
another
bloody
war
driving
our
canoe
ashore
we
hurried
up
to
the
head
chief
of
the
who
was
alternately
haranguing
his
people
and
directing
the
dances
anatlask
i
called
what
does
this
mean
you
are
going
on
the
warpath
tell
me
what
you
are
about
are
you
going
back
to
stickeen
he
looked
at
me
vacantly
a
little
while
and
then
a
grin
spread
from
ear
to
ear
it
was
the
same
chief
in
whose
house
i
had
seen
the
idiot
boy
a
year
before
come
with
me
he
said
he
led
us
into
his
house
and
across
the
room
to
where
in
state
surrounded
by
all
kinds
of
chieftain
gear
chilcat
blankets
totemic
carvings
and
paintings
chieftain
hats
and
cunningly
woven
baskets
there
lay
the
body
of
a
stalwart
young
man
wrapped
in
a
blanket
the
chief
silently
removed
the
blanket
from
the
face
of
the
dead
the
skull
was
completely
crushed
on
one
side
as
by
a
heavy
blow
then
the
story
came
out
the
hootz
or
big
brown
bear
of
that
country
is
as
large
and
savage
as
the
grizzly
bear
of
the
rockies
at
certain
seasons
he
is
as
the
natives
say
always
mad
the
natives
seldom
attack
these
bears
confining
their
attention
to
the
more
timid
and
easily
killed
black
bears
but
this
young
man
with
a
companion
hunting
on
baranof
island
across
the
strait
found
himself
suddenly
confronted
by
an
enormous
hootz
the
young
man
rashly
shot
him
with
his
musket
wounding
him
sufficiently
to
make
him
furious
the
tremendous
brute
hurled
his
thousand
pounds
of
ferocity
at
the
hunter
and
one
little
tap
of
that
huge
paw
crushed
his
skull
like
an
his
companion
brought
his
body
home
and
now
the
whole
tribe
had
formally
declared
war
on
that
bear
and
all
this
dancing
and
painting
and
drumming
was
in
preparation
for
a
war
party
composed
of
all
the
men
dogs
and
guns
in
the
town
they
were
going
on
the
warpath
to
get
that
bear
greatly
relieved
i
gave
them
my
blessing
and
sped
them
on
their
way
we
had
been
rowing
all
night
before
this
incident
and
all
the
next
night
we
sailed
up
the
tortuous
peril
strait
going
upward
with
the
flood
one
man
steering
while
the
other
slept
to
the
meeting
place
of
the
waters
then
down
with
the
receding
tide
through
the
islands
and
so
on
to
sitka
here
we
met
a
warm
reception
from
the
missionaries
and
also
from
the
captain
and
officers
of
the
old
afterwards
used
as
a
school
ship
for
the
navy
in
the
harbor
of
san
francisco
alaska
at
that
time
had
no
vestige
of
civil
government
no
means
of
punishing
crime
no
civil
officers
except
the
customs
collectors
no
magistrate
or
police
everyone
was
a
law
to
himself
the
only
sign
of
authority
was
this
cumbersome
sailing
vessel
with
its
marines
and
sailors
it
could
not
move
out
of
sitka
harbor
without
first
sending
by
the
monthly
mail
steamer
to
san
francisco
for
a
tug
to
come
and
tow
it
through
these
intricate
channels
to
the
sea
where
the
sails
could
be
spread
of
course
it
was
not
of
much
use
to
this
vast
territory
the
officers
of
the
were
supposed
to
be
doing
some
surveying
but
lacking
the
means
of
travel
what
they
did
amounted
to
very
little
they
were
interested
at
once
in
our
account
of
the
discovery
of
glacier
bay
and
of
the
other
unmapped
bays
and
inlets
that
we
had
entered
at
their
request
from
muir
notes
and
our
estimate
of
distances
by
our
rate
of
sailing
and
of
directions
from
observations
of
our
little
compass
we
drew
a
rough
map
of
glacier
bay
this
was
sent
on
to
washington
by
these
officers
and
published
by
the
navy
department
for
six
or
seven
years
it
was
the
only
sailing
chart
of
glacier
bay
and
two
or
three
steamers
were
wrecked
groping
their
way
in
these
uncharted
passages
before
surveying
vessels
began
to
make
accurate
maps
so
from
its
beginning
has
uncle
sam
neglected
this
greatest
and
richest
of
all
his
possessions
our
little
company
separated
at
sitka
stickeen
and
our
indian
crew
were
the
first
to
leave
embarking
for
a
return
trip
to
wrangell
by
canoe
stickeen
had
stuck
close
to
muir
following
him
everywhere
crouching
at
his
feet
where
he
sat
sleeping
in
his
room
at
night
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
leave
muir
explained
the
matter
to
him
fully
talking
to
and
reasoning
with
him
as
if
he
were
human
billy
led
him
aboard
the
canoe
by
a
and
the
last
muir
saw
of
him
he
was
standing
on
of
the
canoe
howling
a
sad
farewell
muir
sailed
south
on
the
monthly
mail
steamer
while
i
took
passage
on
a
trading
steamer
for
another
missionary
trip
among
the
northern
tribes
so
ended
my
canoe
voyages
with
john
muir
their
memory
is
fresh
and
sweet
as
ever
the
flowing
stream
of
years
has
not
washed
away
nor
dimmed
the
impressions
of
those
great
days
we
spent
together
nearly
all
of
them
were
cold
wet
and
uncomfortable
if
one
were
merely
an
animal
to
be
depressed
or
enlivened
by
physical
conditions
but
of
these
hardships
muir
made
nothing
and
i
caught
his
spirit
therefore
the
beauty
the
glory
the
wonder
and
the
thrills
of
those
weeks
of
exploration
are
with
me
yet
and
shall
endure
a
rustless
inexhaustible
treasure

man

lived
aloft
exultant
unafraid
all
things
were
good
to
him
the
mountain

stretched
gnarled
hands
to
help
him
climb
the
peak
waved
blithe
greeting
and
for
him
the
storm
aprowl
for
human
life
purred
like
the
lion

his

him
on
the
narrow
ledge
gave
gruff
good
morning
and
the
right
of
way
the
glacier
cold
of
heart
and
pale
warmed
at
his
gaze
to
amethystine
blush
and
murmured
deep
fond
undertones
of
love
he
walked
apart
from
men
yet
loved
his
kind
and
brought
them
treasures
from
his
larger
store
for
them
he
delved
in
mines
of
richer
gold
earth
messenger
he
was
to
human
hearts
the
starry
moss
flower
from
its
dizzy
shelf
the
ouzel
shaking
forth
its
spray
of
song
the
glacial
runlet
tinkling
its
clear
bell
the
abloom
on
snowy
heights
each
sent
by
him
a
of
cheer
blind
eyes
he
opened
and
deaf
ears
unstopped
he
lived
aloft
apart
he
talked
with
god
in
all
the
myriad
tongues
of
god
sweet
world
but
still
he
came
anear
and
talked
with

vii
the
man
in
perspective
the
friendship
between
john
muir
and
myself
was
of
that
fine
sort
which
grows
and
deepens
with
absence
almost
as
well
as
with
companionship
occasional
letters
passed
from
one
to
the
other
when
i
felt
like
writing
to
muir
i
obeyed
the
impulse
without
asking
whether
i
owed
him
a
letter
and
he
followed
the
same
rule
or
rather
lack
of
rule
sometimes
answers
to
these
letters
came
quickly
sometimes
they
were
long
delayed
so
long
that
they
were
not
answers
at
all
when
i
sent
him
news
of
his
mountains
and
glaciers
that
contained
items
really
novel
to
him
his
replies
were
immediate
and
enthusiastic
when
he
had
found
in
his
great
outdoor
museum
some
peculiar
treasure
he
talked
over
his
find
with
me
by
letter
muir
letters
were
never
commonplace
and
sometimes
they
were
long
and
rich
i
preserved
them
all
and
when
a
few
years
ago
an
alaska
steamboat
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
yukon
carrying
with
it
my
library
and
all
my
literary
possessions
the
loss
of
these
letters
from
my
friend
caused
me
more
sorrow
than
the
loss
of
almost
any
other
of
my
many
priceless
treasures
the
summer
of
the
year
following
that
of
our
second
canoe
voyage
muir
went
as
scientific
and
literary
expert
with
the
revenue
cutter
which
was
sent
by
the
government
into
the
arctic
ocean
in
search
of
the
de
long
exploring
party
his
published
articles
written
on
the
revenue
cutter
were
of
great
interest
but
in
his
more
intimate
letters
to
me
there
was
a
note
of
disappointment
there
have
been
no
mountains
to
climb
he
wrote
although
i
have
had
entrancing
views
of
many
i
have
not
had
a
chance
to
visit
any
glaciers
there
were
no
trees
in
those
arctic
regions
and
but
few
flowers
of
god
process
of
modeling
the
world
i
saw
but
little
nothing
for
days
but
that
limitless
relentless
i
was
confined
within
the
narrow
prison
of
the
ship
i
had
no
freedom
i
went
at
the
will
of
other
men
not
of
my
own
it
was
very
different
from
those
glorious
canoe
voyages
with
you
in
your
beautiful
fruitful
wilderness
a
very
brief
visit
at
muir
home
near
martinez
california
in
the
spring
of
found
him
at
what
he
frankly
said
was
very
distasteful
work
managing
a
large
fruit
ranch
he
was
doing
the
work
well
and
making
his
orchards
pay
large
dividends
but
his
heart
was
in
the
hills
and
woods
eagerly
he
questioned
me
of
my
travels
and
of
the
progress
of
the
glaciers
and
woods
of
alaska
beyond
a
few
short
mountain
trips
he
had
seen
nothing
for
two
years
of
his
beloved
wilds
passionately
he
voiced
his
discontent
i
am
losing
the
precious
days
i
am
degenerating
into
a
machine
for
making
money
i
am
learning
nothing
in
this
trivial
world
of
men
i
must
break
away
and
get
out
into
the
mountains
to
learn
the
news
in
the
ten
years
limit
which
i
had
set
for
service
in
alaska
expired
the
educational
necessities
of
my
children
and
the
feeling
that
was
growing
upon
me
like
a
smothering
cloud
that
if
i
remained
much
longer
among
the
indians
i
would
lose
all
power
to
talk
or
write
good
english
drove
me
from
the
northwest
to
find
a
temporary
home
in
southern
california
i
had
not
notified
muir
of
my
coming
but
suddenly
appeared
in
his
orchard
at
martinez
one
day
in
early
summer
it
was
time
and
he
was
out
among
his
trees
superintending
a
large
force
of
workmen
he
saw
me
as
soon
as
i
discovered
him
and
dropping
the
basket
he
was
carrying
came
running
to
greet
me
with
both
hands
outstretched
ah
my
friend
he
cried
i
have
been
longing
mightily
for
you
you
have
come
to
take
me
on
a
canoe
trip
to
the
countries
beyond
to
lituya
and
yakutat
bays
and
prince
william
sound
have
you
not
my
weariness
of
this
life
has
grown
so
heavy
it
is
like
to
crush
me
i
ready
to
break
away
and
go
with
you
whenever
you
say
no
i
replied
i
am
leaving
alaska
man
man
protested
muir
how
can
you
do
it
you
never
carry
out
such
a
notion
as
that
in
the
world
your
heart
will
cry
every
day
for
the
north
like
a
lost
child
and
in
your
sleep
the
of
your
white
peaks
will
beckon
to
you
why
look
at
me
he
said
and
take
warning
i
a
horrible
example
i
who
have
breathed
the
mountain
air
who
have
really
lived
a
life
of
freedom
condemned
to
penal
servitude
with
these
miserable
little
holding
up
a
bunch
of
cherries
boxing
them
up
putting
them
in
prison
and
for
money
man
i
like
to
die
of
the
shame
of
it
and
then
you
not
safe
a
day
in
this
sordid
world
of
men
i
came
near
dying
a
mean
civilized
death
the
other
day
a
chinaman
emptied
a
bucket
of
phosphorus
over
me
and
almost
burned
me
up
how
different
that
would
have
been
from
a
nice
white
death
in
the
crevasse
of
a
glacier
gin
it
were
na
for
my
bairnies
i
rin
awa
frae
a
this
tribble
hale
ye
back
north
wi
me
so
muir
would
run
on
now
in
english
now
in
broad
scotch
but
through
all
his
raillery
there
ran
a
note
of
longing
for
the
wilderness
i
want
to
see
what
is
going
on
he
said
so
many
great
events
are
happening
and
i
not
there
to
see
them
i
learning
nothing
here
that
will
do
me
any
good
i
spent
the
night
with
him
and
we
talked
till
long
after
midnight
sailing
anew
our
voyages
of
enchantment
he
had
just
completed
his
work
of
editing
picturesque
california
and
gave
me
a
set
of
the
beautiful
volumes
our
paths
did
not
converge
again
for
nine
years
but
i
was
to
have
after
all
a
few
more
alaska
days
with
john
muir
the
itch
of
the
wanderlust
in
my
feet
had
become
a
wearisome
nervous
ache
increasing
with
the
years
and
the
call
of
the
wild
more
imperative
until
the
fierce
yearning
for
the
north
was
at
times
more
than
i
could
bear
the
first
of
the
great
northward
gold
stampedes
that
of
to
the
klondyke
in
northwestern
canada
on
the
borders
of
alaska
afforded
me
the
opportunity
for
which
i
was
longing
to
return
to
the
land
of
my
heart
the
latter
part
of
august
saw
me
on
the
largest
of
that
great
fleet
of
passenger
boats
that
were
traversing
the
thousand
miles
of
wonder
and
beauty
between
seattle
and
skagway
these
steamboats
were
all
laden
with
gold
seekers
and
their
goods
seattle
sprang
into
prominence
and
wealth
doubling
her
population
in
a
few
months
from
every
community
in
the
united
states
from
all
canada
and
from
many
lands
across
the
oceans
came
that
strange
mob
of
lawyers
doctors
clerks
merchants
farmers
mechanics
engineers
reporters
sharpers
all
all
mad
with
excitement
all
rushing
into
a
thousand
new
and
hard
experiences
as
i
stood
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
vessel
watching
the
strange
scene
on
the
dock
who
should
come
up
the
but
john
muir
wearing
the
same
old
gray
ulster
and
scotch
cap
it
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
i
would
have
looked
for
him
but
he
was
not
stampeding
to
the
klondyke
his
being
there
at
that
time
was
really
an
accident
in
company
with
two
other
eminent
he
had
been
spending
the
summer
in
the
study
of
the
forests
of
canada
and
the
three
were
climaxing
as
they
said
in
the
forests
of
alaska
five
pleasurable
days
we
had
together
on
board
muir
was
vastly
amused
by
the
motley
crowd
of
excited
men
their
various
outfits
their
queer
equipment
their
ridiculous
notions
of
camping
and
life
in
the
wilderness
a
nest
of
ants
he
called
them
taken
to
a
strange
country
and
stirred
up
with
a
stick
as
our
steamboat
touched
at
port
townsend
muir
received
a
long
telegram
from
a
san
francisco
newspaper
offering
him
a
large
sum
if
he
would
go
over
the
mountains
and
down
the
yukon
to
the
klondyke
and
write
them
letters
about
conditions
there
he
brought
the
telegram
to
me
laughing
heartily
at
the
absurdity
of
anybody
making
him
such
a
proposition
do
they
think
i
daft
he
asked
like
a
the
lave
o
thae
puir
bodies
when
i
go
into
that
wild
it
will
not
be
in
a
crowd
like
this
or
on
such
a
sordid
mission
ah
my
old
friend
they
be
spoiling
our
grand
alaska
he
offered
to
secure
for
me
the
reporter
job
tendered
to
him
i
refused
urging
my
lack
of
training
for
such
work
and
my
more
important
and
responsible
position
why
that
same
paper
has
a
host
of
reporters
on
the
way
to
the
klondyke
now
i
said
there
is
naming
a
noted
poet
and
author
of
the
coast
he
must
be
down
to
dawson
by
this
time
does
count
replied
muir
for
the
patent
reason
that
everybody
knows
he
ca
tell
the
truth
the
poor
fellow
is
not
to
blame
for
it
he
was
just
made
that
way
everybody
will
read
with
delight
his
wonderful
tales
of
the
trail
but
nobody
will
believe
him
we
all
know
him
too
well
muir
contracted
a
hard
cold
the
first
night
out
from
seattle
the
hot
close
stateroom
and
a
cold
blast
through
the
narrow
window
were
the
cause
a
distressing
cough
racked
his
whole
frame
when
he
refused
to
go
to
a
physician
who
was
on
the
boat
i
brought
the
doctor
to
him
after
the
usual
examination
the
physician
asked
what
do
you
generally
do
for
a
cold
oh
said
muir
i
shiver
it
away
explain
yourself
said
the
puzzled
doctor
drawled
muir
two
or
three
years
ago
i
camped
by
the
muir
glacier
for
a
week
i
had
caught
just
such
a
cold
as
this
from
the
same
cause
a
stuffy
stateroom
so
i
made
me
a
little
sled
out
of
spruce
boughs
put
a
blanket
and
some
sea
biscuit
on
it
and
set
out
up
the
glacier
i
got
into
a
labyrinth
of
crevasses
and
a
driving
snowstorm
and
had
to
spend
the
night
on
the
ice
ten
miles
from
land
i
sat
on
the
sled
all
night
or
thrashed
about
it
and
had
a
dickens
of
a
time
i
shivered
so
hard
i
shook
the
sled
to
pieces
when
morning
came
my
cold
was
all
gone
that
is
my
prescription
doctor
you
are
welcome
to
use
it
in
your
practice
well
laughed
the
doctor
if
i
had
such
patients
as
you
in
such
a
country
as
this
i
might
try
your
heroic
remedy
but
i
am
afraid
it
would
hardly
serve
in
general
practice
muir
and
i
made
the
most
of
these
few
days
together
and
walked
the
decks
till
late
each
night
for
he
had
much
to
tell
me
he
had
at
last
written
his
story
of
stickeen
and
was
working
on
books
treating
of
the
big
trees
the
national
parks
and
the
glaciers
of
alaska
at
wrangell
as
we
went
ashore
we
were
greeted
by
joyful
exclamations
from
the
little
company
of
old
stickeen
indians
we
found
on
the
dock
that
sharp
intaking
of
the
breath
which
is
the
thlinget
note
of
surprise
and
delight
and
the
words
ankow
ka
glate
priest
chief
and
ice
chief
passed
along
the
line
death
had
made
many
gaps
in
the
old
circle
of
friends
both
white
and
native
but
the
welcome
from
those
who
remained
warmed
our
hearts
from
wrangell
northward
the
steamboat
followed
the
route
of
our
canoe
voyage
of
through
wrangell
narrows
into
prince
frederick
sound
past
norris
glacier
and
holkham
bay
into
stevens
passage
past
taku
bay
to
juneau
and
on
to
lynn
canal
then
on
the
track
of
our
voyage
of
up
to
haines
and
beyond
fifteen
miles
to
that
new
chaotic
camp
in
the
woods
called
skagway
the
two
or
three
days
which
it
took
to
discharge
her
load
of
passengers
and
cargo
of
their
outfits
were
spent
by
muir
and
his
scientific
companions
in
roaming
the
forests
and
mountains
about
skagway
and
examining
the
flora
of
that
region
they
kept
mostly
off
the
trail
of
the
struggling
straggling
army
of
newcomers
who
were
blunderingly
trying
to
get
their
goods
and
themselves
across
the
rugged
jagged
mountains
on
their
way
to
the
promised
land
of
gold
but
muir
found
time
to
spend
some
hours
with
me
in
my
camp
under
a
hemlock
where
he
ate
again
of
my
cooking
over
a
you
are
going
on
a
strange
journey
this
time
my
friend
he
admonished
me
i
do
envy
you
you
have
a
hard
time
keeping
your
heart
light
and
simple
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
of
madmen
instead
of
the
music
of
the
wind
among
the
and
the
tinkling
of
the
waterfalls
your
ears
will
be
filled
with
the
oaths
and
groans
of
these
poor
deluded
men
keep
close
to
nature
heart
yourself
and
break
clear
away
once
in
a
while
and
climb
a
mountain
or
spend
a
week
in
the
woods
wash
your
spirit
clean
from
the
of
this
sordid
crowd
in
god
pure
air
it
will
help
you
in
your
efforts
to
bring
to
these
men
something
better
than
gold
do
lose
your
freedom
and
your
love
of
the
earth
as
god
made
it
in
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
have
one
more
alaska
day
with
john
muir
at
skagway
after
a
year
in
the
klondyke
i
had
spent
the
winter
of
in
the
eastern
states
arousing
the
christian
public
to
the
needs
of
this
newly
discovered
empire
of
the
north
and
was
returning
with
other
ministers
to
interior
and
western
alaska
the
white
pass
railroad
was
completed
only
to
the
summit
and
it
was
a
laborious
task
requiring
a
month
of
very
hard
work
to
get
our
goods
from
skagway
over
the
thirty
miles
of
mountains
to
lake
bennett
where
we
could
load
them
on
our
open
boat
for
the
voyage
of
two
thousand
miles
down
the
yukon
while
i
was
engaged
in
this
task
there
came
to
skagway
the
steamship
carrying
one
of
the
most
remarkable
companies
of
scientific
men
ever
gathered
together
in
one
expedition
harriman
the
great
railroad
magnate
had
chartered
the
steamer
and
had
invited
as
his
guests
many
men
of
world
reputation
in
various
branches
of
natural
science
among
them
were
john
burroughs
drs
merriam
and
dahl
of
the
smithsonian
institute
and
not
least
john
muir
indeed
he
was
called
the
nestor
of
the
expedition
and
his
advice
followed
as
that
of
no
other
the
enticing
proposition
was
made
me
by
muir
and
backed
by
harriman
personal
invitation
that
i
should
join
this
distinguished
company
share
muir
stateroom
and
spend
the
summer
cruising
along
the
southern
and
western
coasts
of
alaska
however
the
new
mining
camps
were
calling
with
a
still
more
imperative
voice
and
i
had
to
turn
my
back
to
the
coast
and
face
the
great
interior
but
what
a
joy
and
inspiration
it
would
have
been
to
climb
muir
geicke
and
taylor
glaciers
again
with
muir
note
the
rapid
progress
god
was
making
in
his
work
of
landscape
gardening
by
means
of
these
great
tools
make
at
last
our
deferred
visits
to
lituya
and
yakutat
bays
and
the
fine
glaciers
of
prince
william
sound
and
renew
my
studies
of
this
good
world
under
my
great
master
a
letter
from
muir
about
his
summer
cruise
written
in
november
reached
me
at
nome
in
june
for
those
of
us
who
had
reached
that
bleak
exposed
northwestern
coast
and
wintered
there
did
not
get
any
mail
for
six
months
we
were
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
a
in
his
letter
muir
wrote
the
voyage
was
a
grand
one
and
i
saw
much
that
was
new
to
me
and
packed
full
of
interest
and
instruction
but
do
you
know
i
longed
to
break
away
from
the
steamboat
and
its
splendid
company
get
a
dugout
canoe
and
a
crew
of
indians
and
with
you
as
my
companion
poke
into
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
the
mountains
and
glaciers
which
we
could
not
reach
from
the
steamer
what
great
days
we
have
had
together
you
and
i
this
day
at
skagway
in
was
the
last
of
my
alaska
days
with
john
muir
except
as
i
bring
them
back
and
live
them
over
in
my
thoughts
how
often
in
my
long
voyages
by
canoe
or
steamer
among
the
thousand
islands
of
southeastern
alaska
the
intricate
channels
of
prince
william
sound
the
great
rivers
and
multitudinous
lakes
of
the
interior
and
the
treeless
windswept
coasts
of
bering
sea
and
the
arctic
ocean
or
in
my
tramps
in
the
summer
over
the
mountains
and
plains
of
alaska
or
in
the
winter
with
my
dogs
over
the
frozen
wilderness
fighting
the
great
battle
with
the
fierce
cold
or
spellbound
under
the
magic
of
the
aurora
how
often
have
i
longed
for
the
presence
of
muir
to
heighten
my
enjoyment
by
his
higher
ecstasy
or
reveal
to
me
what
i
was
too
dull
to
see
or
understand
i
have
had
inspiring
companions
and
my
life
has
been
blessed
by
many
friendships
inestimably
precious
and
rich
but
for
me
the
world
has
produced
but
one
john
muir
and
to
no
other
man
do
i
feel
that
i
owe
so
much
for
i
was
blind
and
he
made
me
see
only
once
since
did
i
meet
him
and
then
but
for
an
hour
at
his
temporary
home
in
los
angeles
in
he
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
his
rich
volume
the
story
of
my
boyhood
and
youth
i
submitted
for
his
review
and
correction
the
article
which
forms
the
first
two
chapters
of
this
book
with
that
nice
regard
for
absolute
verity
which
always
characterized
him
he
pointed
out
two
or
three
passages
in
which
his
recollection
clashed
with
mine
and
i
at
once
made
the
changes
he
suggested
muir
never
grew
old
after
he
was
sixty
years
of
age
as
men
count
age
some
of
his
most
daring
feats
of
mountain
climbing
and
some
of
his
longest
journeys
into
the
wilds
were
undertaken
when
he
was
past
seventy
he
was
still
tramping
and
camping
in
the
forests
and
among
the
hills
when
he
was
he
made
long
trips
to
south
america
and
africa
and
to
the
very
end
he
was
exploring
studying
working
and
enjoying
all
his
writings
exult
with
the
spirit
of
immortal
youth
there
is
in
his
books
an
intimate
companionship
with
the
trees
the
mountains
the
flowers
and
the
animals
that
is
altogether
fine
surely
no
such
books
of
mountains
and
forests
were
ever
written
as
his
mountains
of
california
my
first
summer
in
the
sierra
the
yosemite
and
our
national
parks
his
brooks
and
trees
are
the
abode
of
dryads
and
hamadryads
they
live
and
talk
and
when
he
writes
of
the
animals
he
has
met
in
his
rambles
without
any
attempt
to
put
into
their
characters
anything
that
does
not
belong
to
them
without
manufacturing
his
data
he
somehow
manages
to
do
much
more
than
introduce
them
to
you
he
makes
you
their
intimate
and
admiring
friends
as
he
was
his
ouzel
bobs
you
a
cheery
good
morning
and
sprays
you
with
its
ripple
of
song
his
douglas
squirrel
scolds
and
swears
at
you
with
rough
and
his
gazes
at
you
with
frank
and
friendly
eyes
and
challenges
you
to
follow
to
its
splendid
heights
not
as
a
hunter
but
as
a
companion
you
love
them
all
as
muir
did
as
an
instance
of
this
power
in
his
writings
when
i
returned
from
the
klondyke
in
the
story
of
stickeen
had
been
published
in
a
magazine
a
few
months
before
i
met
in
new
york
a
daughter
of
the
great
field
family
who
when
a
child
had
heard
me
tell
of
muir
exploit
in
rescuing
me
from
the
mountain
top
and
who
had
shouted
with
delight
when
i
told
of
our
sliding
down
the
mountain
in
the
moraine
gravel
she
asked
me
eagerly
if
i
was
the
young
mentioned
in
muir
story
when
i
said
that
i
was
she
called
to
her
companions
and
introduced
me
as
the
owner
of
stickeen
and
i
was
content
to
have
as
my
claim
to
an
earthly
immortality
my
ownership
of
an
immortalized
dog
i
can
not
think
of
john
muir
as
dead
or
as
much
changed
from
the
man
with
whom
i
canoed
and
camped
he
was
too
much
a
part
of
nature
too
natural
to
be
separated
from
his
mountains
trees
and
glaciers
somewhere
i
am
sure
he
is
making
other
explorations
solving
other
natural
problems
using
that
brilliant
inventive
genius
to
good
effect
and
some
time
again
i
shall
hear
him
unfold
anew
with
still
clearer
insight
and
more
eloquent
words
fresh
secrets
of
his
mountains
of
god
the
thlingets
have
a
happy
hunting
ground
in
the
spirit
land
for
dogs
as
well
as
for
men
and
muir
used
to
contend
that
they
were
right
that
the
lower
animals
have
as
much
right
to
a
heaven
as
humans
i
wonder
if
he
has
found
a
still
more
beautiful
a
glorified
stickeen
and
if
the
little
fellow
still
follows
and
frisks
about
him
as
in
those
old
days
i
like
to
think
so
and
when
i
too
cross
the
great
divide
and
it
ca
be
long
now
i
shall
look
eagerly
for
them
both
to
be
my
companions
in
fresh
adventures
in
the
meantime
i
am
lonely
for
them
and
think
of
them
often
and
say
with
what
a
dog
and
what
a
man

in
the
united
states

america
