the

and
a
wind
came
up
and
carried
them
away
standing
up
he
was
terribly
tall

hairs
out
of
my

with
that
he
took
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
by
the
shoulders
and
lifted
him
on
his
horse
turning
the
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
king
s
castle
the
king
s
son
rode
on
his
hound
at
his
heel
his
hawk
on
his
wrist
a
brave
steed
to
carry
him
whither
he
list
and
the
blue
sky
over
him
that
evening
the
king
noticed
that
his
son
was
greatly
troubled
and
when
he
lay
down
to
sleep
everyone
in
the
castle
heard
his
groans
and
his
moans
the
next
day
he
told
his
father
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
the
king
sent
for
maravaun
his
councillor
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
who
the
enchanter
was
and
where
his
son
would
be
likely
to
find
him
from
what
he
said
said
maravaun
we
may
guess
who
he
is
he
is
the
enchanter
of
the
black
and
his
is
hard
to
find
nevertheless
your
son
must
seek
for
him
and
take
the
three
hairs
out
of
his
beard
or
else
lose
his
head
for
if
the
heir
to
your
kingdom
does
not
honorably
pay
his
forfeit
the
ground
of
ireland
won
t
give
crops
and
the
cattle
won
t
give
and
said
the
councillor
as
a
year
is
little
for
his
search
he
should
start
off
at
once
although
i
m
bound
to
say
that
i
don
t
know
what
direction
he
should
go
the
next
day
the
king
s
son
said
to
his
father
and
his
and
started
off
on
his
journey
his

not
give
him
her
blessing
on
account
of
his
having
brought
in
the
brown
bear
that
turned
her
from
her
chair
in
the
nor
would
she
let
him
have
the
good
horse
he
always
rode
instead
the
prince
was
given
a
horse
that
was
lame
in
a
leg
and
short
in
the
tail
and
neither
hawk
nor
hound
went
with
him
this
time
all
day
the
king
s
son
was
going
traveling
through
wood
and
waste
until
the
coming
on
of
night
the
little
fluttering
birds
were
going
from
the
bush
tops
from
tuft
to
tuft
and
to

but
if
they
were
he
was
not

on

and
dark
then
the
king
s
son
ate
his
bread
and
meat
put
his
satchel
under
his
head
and
lay
down
to
take
his
rest
on
the
edge
of
a
great
waste
in
the
morning
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
on
and
as
he
went
across
the
waste
he
saw
an
extraordinary
sight
everywhere
were
the
bodies
of
dead
creatures
a
cock
a
wren
a
mouse
a
weasel
a
fox
a

the
birds
and

had
ever
known
he
went
on
but
he
saw
no
living
creature
before
him
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
waste
he
came
upon
two
living
creatures
struggling
one
was
an
eagle
and
the
other
was
an
eel
and
the
eel
had
twisted
itself
round
the
eagle
and
the
eagle
had
covered
her
eyes
with
the
black
films
of
death
the
king
s
son
jumped
off
his
horse
and
cut
the
eel
in
two
with
a
sharp
stroke
of
his
sword
the
eagle
drew
the
films
from
her
eyes
and
looked
full

tree

my
she
rose
up
as
a
swan
and
flew
away
the
blue
falcon
went
flying
from
bush
to
bush
and
from
rock
to
rock
the
night
came
but
in
the
morning
the
blue
falcon
was
seen
again
the
king
s
son
followed
and
at
last
he
saw
a
house
before
him
he
went
in
and
there
seated
on
a
chair
of
gold
was
the
man
who
seemed
so
tall
when
he
threw
down
the
cards
upon
the
heap
of
stones
the
enchanter
did
not
recognize
the
king
s
son
without
his
hawk
and
his
hound
and
the
fine
clothes
he
used
to
wear
he
asked
who
he
was
and
the
king
s
son
said
he
was
a
youth
who
had
just
finished
an
apprenticeship
to
a
wizard
and
said
he
i
have
heard
that
you
have
three
fair
daughters
and
i
came
to
strive
to
gain
one
of
them
for
a

that
case
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
you
will
have
to
do
three
tasks
for
me
if
you
are
able
to
do
them
i
will
give
you
one
of
my
three
daughters
in
marriage
if
you
fail
to
do
any
one
of
them
you
will
lose
your
head
are
you
willing
to
make
the
trial
i
am
willing
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
then
i
shall
give
you
your
first
task
it
is
unlucky
that
you
came
in
this
country
we
eat
a
meal
only
once
a
week
and
we
have
had
our
meal
this
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
said
the
king
s
son
i
can
do
without
food
or
drink
for
a
month
without
any
i
suppose
you
can
do
without
sleep
too
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
easily
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
that
is
good
come
outside
now
and
i
ll
show
you
your
he
took
the
king
s
son
outside
and
showed
him
a
dry
narrow
at
the
gable
end
of
the
house
there
is
where
you
are
to
sleep
said
the
enchanter
tuck
yourself
into
it
now
and
be
ready
for
your
first
task
at
the
rising
of
the
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
into
the
little
tank
he
was
uncomfortable
there
you
may
be
sure
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
fedelma
came
and
brought
him
into
a
fine
room
where
he
ate
and
then
slept
until
the
sun
was
about
to
rise
in
the
morning
she
called
him
and
he
went
outside
and
laid
himself
down
in
the
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
the
enchanter
of
the
black
came
out
of
the
house
and
stood
beside
the
come
now
said
he
and
i
will
show
you
the
first
task
you
have
to
he
took
him
to
where
a
herd
of
goats
was
grazing
away
from
the
goats
was
a
fawn
with
white
feet
and
little
bright
horns
the
fawn
saw
them
bounded
into
the
air
and
raced
away
to
the
wood
as
quickly
as
any
arrow
that
a
man
ever
shot
from
a
bow
that
is
whitefoot
the
fawn
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
she
grazes
with
my
goats
but
none
of
my
gillies
can
bring
her
into
my
here
is
your
first
task
run
down
whitefoot
the
fawn
and
bring
her
with
my
goats
into
the
this
when
he
said
that
the
enchanter
of
the
black
went
away
laughing
to
himself
my
life
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
i
might
as
well
try
to
catch
an
eagle
on
the
wing
as
to
run
down
the
deer
that
has
gone
out
of
sight
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
his
despair
was
great
then
his
name
was
called
and
he
saw
fedelma
coming
towards
him
she
looked
at
him
as
though
she
were
in
dread
and
said
what
task
has
my
father
set
you
he
told
her
and
then
she
smiled
i
was
in
dread
it
would
be
a
more
terrible
task
she
said
this
one
is
easy
i
can
help
you
to
catch
whitefoot
the
fawn
but
first
eat
what
i
have
brought
she
put
down
bread
and
meat
and
wine
and
they
sat
down
and
he
ate
and
drank
i
thought
he
might
set
you
this
task
she
said
and
so
i
brought
you
something
from
my
father
s
store
of
enchanted
things
here
are
the
shoes
of
swiftness
with
these
on
your
feet
you
can
run
down
whitefoot
the
fawn
but
you
must
catch
her
before
she
has
gone
very
far
away
remember
that
she
must
be
brought
in
when
the
goats
are
going
into
their
shelter
at
sunset
you
will
have
to
walk
back
for
all
the
time
you
must
keep
hold
of
her
silver
horns
hasten
now
run
her
down
with
the
shoes
of
swiftness
and
then
lay
hold
of
her
horns
above
all
things
whitefoot
dreads
the
loss
of
her
silver
he
thanked
fedelma
he
put
on
the
shoes
of
swiftness
and
went
into
the
wood
now
he
could
go
as
the
eagle
flies
he
found
whitefoot
the
fawn
drinking
at
the
raven
s
pool
when
she
saw
him
she
went
from
thicket
to
thicket
the
shoes
of
swiftness
were
hardly
any
use
to
him
in
these
places
at
last
he
beat
her
from
the
last
thicket
it
was
the
hour
of
then
there
was
a
clear
plain
before
them
and
with
the
shoes
of
swiftness
he
ran
her
down
there
were
tears
in
the
fawn
s
eyes
and
he
knew
she
was
troubled
with
the
dread
of
losing
her
silver
horns
he
kept
his
hands
on
the
horns
and
they
went
back
over
miles
of
plain
and
pasture
bog
and
wood
the
hours
were
going
quicker
than
they
were
going
when
he
came
within
the
domain
of
the
enchanter
of
the
black
he
saw
the
goats
going
quickly
before
him
they
were
hurrying
from
their
pastures
to
the
one
stopping
maybe
to
bite
the
top
of
a
hedge
and
another
giving
this
one
a
blow
with
her
horns
to
hurry
her
on
by
your
silver
horns
we
must
go
faster
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
to
the
fawn
they
went
more
quickly
then
he
saw
the
enchanter
of
the
black
waiting
at
the
now
counting
the
goats
that
came
along
and
now
looking
at
the
sun
when
he
saw
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
coming
with
his
capture
he
was
so
angry
that
he
struck
an
old
goat
that
had
stopped
to
rub
itself
the
goat
reared
up
and
struck
him
with
his
horns
well
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
you
have
performed
your
first
task
i
see
you
are
a
greater
enchanter
than
i
thought
you
were
whitefoot
the
fawn
can
go
in
with
my
goats
go
back
now
to
your
own
i
ll
come
to
you
early
and
give
you
your
second
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
back
and
into
the
dry
he
was
tired
with
his
day
s
journey
after
whitefoot
the
fawn
it
was
his
hope
that
fedelma
would
come
to
him
and
give
him
shelter
for
that
night
iv
until
the
white
moon
rose
above
the
trees
until
the
hounds
went
out
hunting
for
themselves
until
the
foxes
came
down
and
hid
in
the
hedges
waiting
for
the
cocks
and
hens
to
stir
out
at
the
first
light
so
long
did
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
stay
huddled
in
the
dry
by
that
time
he
was
stiff
and
sore
and
hungry
he
saw
a
great
white
owl
flying
towards
the
tank
the
owl
perched
on
the
edge
and
stared
at
the
king
s
son
have
you
a
message
for
me
he
asked
the
owl
shrugged
with
its
wings
three
times
he
thought
that
meant
a
message
he
got
out
of
the
tank
and
prepared
to
follow
the
owl
it
flew
slowly
and
near
the
ground
so
he
was
able
to
follow
it
along
a
path
through
the
wood
the
king
s
son
thought
the
owl
was
bringing
him
to
a
place
where
fedelma
was
and
that
he
would
get
food
there
and
shelter
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
sure
enough
the
owl
flew
to
a
little
house
in
the
wood
the
king
s
son
looked
through
the
window
and
he
saw
a
room
lighted
with
candles
and
a
table
with
plates
and
dishes
and
cups
with
bread
and
meat
and
wine
and
he
saw
at
the
fire
a
young
woman
spinning
at
a
spinning
wheel
and
her
back
was
towards
him
and
her
hair
was
the
same
as
fedelma
s
then
he
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
and
went
very
joyfully
into
the
little
house
but
when
the
young
woman
at
the
spinning
wheel
turned
round
he
saw
that
she
was
not
fedelma
at
all
she
had
a
little
mouth
a
long
and
a
hooked
nose
and
her
eyes
looked
at
a
person
the
thread
she
was
spinning
she
bit
with
her
long
teeth
and
she
said
you
are
welcome
here
and
who
are
you
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
aefa
is
my
name
said
she
i
am
the
eldest
and
the
wisest
daughter
of
the
enchanter
of
the
black
my
father
is
preparing
a
task
for
you
said
she
and
it
will
be
a
terrible
task
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
help
you
with
it
so
you
will
lose
your
head
surely
and
what
i
would
advise
you
to
do
is
to
escape
out
of
this
country
at
and
how
can
i
escape
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
there
s
only
one
way
to
escape
said
she
and
that
is
for
you
to
take
the
slight
red
steed
that
my
father
has
secured
under
nine
locks
that
steed
is
the
only
creature
that
can
bring
you
to
your
own
country
i
will
show
you
how
to
get
it
and
then
i
will
ride
to
your
home
with

why
should
you
do
that
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
because
i
would
marry
you
said
aefa
but
said
he
if
i
live
at
all
fedelma

the
one
i
will
no
sooner
did
he
say
the
words
than
aefa
screamed
out
seize
him
my
seize
him
and
hold
then
the
that
was
under
the
table
sprang
across
the
room
and
fixed
himself
on
his
shoulder
he
ran
out
of
the
house
all
the
time
he
was
running
the
was
trying
to
tear
his
eyes
out
he
made
his
way
through
woods
and
thickets
and
mighty
glad
he
was
when
he
saw
the
tank
at
the
of
the
house
the
dropped
from
his
back
then
he
got
into
the
tank
and
waited
and
waited
no
message
came
from
fedelma
he
was
a
long
time
there
stiff
and
sore
and
hungry
before
the
sun
rose
and
the
enchanter
of
the
black
came
out
of
the
house
v
i
hope
you
had
a
good
night
s
rest
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
when
he
came
to
where
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
crouched
just
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
i
had
indeed
said
the
king
s
son
and
i
suppose
you
feel
fit
for
another
task
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
more
fit
than
ever
in
my
life
before
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
enchanter
of
the
black
took
him
past
the
and
to
where
there
was
an
open
shelter
for

he
and
i

he
and

enough
feathers
of
wild
birds
and

shelter
for

and
let

be
done
before

set
of
he
gave
the
king
s
son
arrows
and
a
bow
and
a
bag
to
put
the
feathers
in
and
advised
him
to
search
the
moor
for
birds
then
he
went
back
to
the
house
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
ran
to
the
moor
and
watched
for
birds
to
fly
across
at
last
one
came
he
shot
at
it
with
an
arrow
but
did
not
bring
it
down
he
hunted
the
moor
all
over
but
found
no
other
bird
he
hoped
that
he
would
see
fedelma
before
his
head
was
taken
off
then
he
heard
his
name
called
and
he
saw
fedelma
coming
towards
him
she
looked
at
him
as
before
with
dread
in
thier
eyes
and
asked
him
what
task
her
father
had
set
him
a
terrible
task
he
said
and
he
told
her
what
it
was

would
give
you

task
she
said

this
one
sit
down
now
and
eat
and
drink
from
what
i
have
brought
he
sat
down
and
ate
and
drank
and
he
felt
hopeful
seeing
fedelma
beside
him
when
he
had
eaten
fedelma
said
my
blue
falcon
will
gather
the
birds
and
pull
the
feathers
off
for
you
still
unless
you
gather
them
quickly
there
is
danger
for
the
roof
must
be
thatched
with
feathers
at
the
set
of
she
whistled
and
her
blue
falcon
came
he
followed
it
across
the
moor
the
blue
falcon
flew
up
in
the
air
and
gave
a
birds
gathered
and
she
swooped
amongst
them
pulling
feathers
off
their
backs
and
out
of
their
wings
soon
there
was
a
heap
of
feathers
on
the
ground
pigeons
feathers
and
pie
s
feathers
crane
s
and
crow
s
blackbird
s
and
starling
s
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
quickly
gathered
them
into
his
bag
the
falcon
flew
to
another
place
and
gave
her
again
the
birds
gathered
and
she
went
amongst
them
plucking
their
feathers
the
king
s
son
gathered
them
and
the
blue
falcon
flew
to
another
place
over
and
over
again
the
blue
falcon
called
to
the
birds
and
plucked
out
their
feathers
and
over
and
over
again
the
king
s
son
gathered
them
into
his
bag
when
he
thought
he
had
feathers
enough
to
thatch
the
roof
he
ran
back
to
the
shelter
he
began
the
thatching
binding
the
feathers
down
with
little
willow
rods
he
had
just
finished
when
the
sun
went
down
the
old
enchanter
came
up
and
when
he
saw
what
the
king
s
son
had
done
he
was
greatly
surprised
you
surely
learned
from
the
wizard
you
were
apprenticed
to
said
but
i
will
try
you
with
another
task
go
now
and
sleep
in
the
place
where
you
were
last
the
king
s
son
glad
that
the
head
was
still
on
his
shoulders
went
and
lay
down
in
the
vi
until
the
white
moon
went
out
in
the
sky
until
the
secret
people
began
to
whisper
in
the
woods
so
long
did
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
remain
in
the
dry
that
night
and
then
when
it
was
neither
dark
nor
light
he
saw
a
crane
flying
towards
him
it
lighted
on
the
edge
of
the
tank
have
you
a
message
for
me
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
crane
tapped
three
times
with
its
beak
then
the
king
s
son
got
out
of
the
tank
and
prepared
to
follow
the
this
was
the
way
the
crane
went
it
would
fly
a
little
way
and
then
light
on
the
ground
until
the
prince
came
up
to
it
then
it
would
fly
again
over
marshes
and
across
little
streams
the
crane
led
him
and
all
the
time
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
thought
he
was
being
brought
to
the
place
where
fedelma
was
to
the
place
where
he
would
get
food
and
where
he
could
rest
until
just
before
the
sun
rose
they
went
on
and
on
till
they
came
to
an
old
tower
the
crane
lighted
upon
it
the
king
s
son
saw
there
was
an
iron
door
in
the
tower
and
he
pulled
a
chain
until
it
opened
then
he
saw
a
little
room
lighted
with
candles
and
he
saw
a
young
woman
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
her
back
was
towards
him
and
her
hair
was
the
same
as
fedelma
s
but
when
the
young
woman
turned
round
he
saw
she
was
not
fedelma
she
was
little
and
she
had
a
face
that
was
brown
and
tight
like
a
nut
she
made
herself
very
friendly
to
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
went
to
him
and
took
his
hands
and
smiled
into
his
face
you
are
welcome
here
said
she
who
are
you
he
asked
i
am
gilveen
said
she
the
second
and
the
most
loving
of
the
three
daughters
of
the
enchanter
of
the
black
she
stroked
his
face
and
his
hands
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
why
did
you
send
for
me
because
i
know
what
great
trouble
you
are
in
my
father
is
preparing
a
task
for
you
and
it
will
be
a
terrible
one
you
will
never
be
able
to
carry
it
and
what
should
you
advise
me
to
do
king
s
daughter
let
me
help
you
in
this
tower
said
she
there
are
the
wisest
books
in
the
world
we
ll
surely
find
in
one
of
them
a
way
for
you
to
get
from
this
country
and
then
i
ll
go
back
with
you
to
your
own
why
would
you
do
that
asked
the
king
of
s
son
because
i
wish
to
be
your
wife
gilveen
said
but
said
he
if
i
live
at
all
fedelma
is
the
one
i
ll
when
he
said
that
gilveen
drew
her
lips
together
and
her
chin
became
like
a
horn
then
she
whistled
through
her
teeth
and
instantly
everything
in
the
room
began
to
attack
the
king
s
son
the
looking
glass
on
the
wall
flung
itself
at
him
and
hit
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
the
leg
of
the
table
gave
him
a
terrible
blow
at
the
back
of
the
knees
he
saw
the
two
candles
hopping
across
the
floor
to
burn
his
legs
he
ran
out
of
the
room
and
when
he
got
to
the
door
it
swung
around
and
gave
him
a
blow
that
flung
him
away
from
the
tower
the
crane
that
was
waiting
on
the
tower
flew
down
its
neck
and
beak
outstretched
and
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
back
so
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
back
over
the
marshes
and
across
the
little
streams
and
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
of
the
house
again
je
went
into
the
tank
he
knew
that
he
had
not
long
to
wait
before
the
sun
would
rise
and
the
enchanter
of
the
black
would
come
to
him
and
give
him
the
third
and
the
most
difficult
of
the
three
tasks
and
he
thought
that
fedelma
was
surely
shut
away
from
him
and
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
help
him
that
day
vii
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
the
enchanter
of
the
black
came
to
where
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
huddled
and
said
i
am
now
going
to
set
you
the
third
and
last
task
rise
up
now
and
come
with
the
king
s
son
came
out
of
the
and
the
enchanter
they
went
to
where
there
was
a
well
the
king
s
son
looked
down
and
he
could
not
see
the
bottom
so
deep
the
well
was
at
the
bottom
said
the
enchanter
is
the
ring
of
youth
you
must
get
it
and
bring
it
to
me
or
else
you
must
lose
your
head
at
the
setting
of
that
that
was
all
he
said
he
turned
then
and
went
away
the
king
s
son
looked
into
the
well
and
he
saw
no
way
of
getting
down
its
deep
smooth
sides
he
walked
back
towards
the
castle
on
his
way
he
met
fedelma
and
she
looked
at
him
with
deep
dread
in
her
eyes
what
task
did
my
father
set
you
said
she
he
bids
me
go
down
into
a
well
said
the
king
s
son
a
well
said
fedelma
and
she
became
all
dread
i
have
to
take
the
ring
of
youth
from
the
and
bring
it
to
him
said
the
king
s
son
oh
said
fedelma
he
has
set
you
the
task
i
then
she
said
you
will
lose
your
life
if
the
ring
of
youth
is
not
taken
out
of
the
well
and
if
you
lose
yours
i
shall
lose
my
life
too
there
is
one
way
to
get
down
the
sides
of
the
well
you
must
kill
me
take
my
bones
and
make
them
as
steps
while
you
go
down
the
sides
then
when
you
have
taken
the
ring
of
youth
out
of
the
water
put
my
bones
as
they
were
before
and
put
the
ring
above
my
heart
i
shall
be
alive
again
but
you
must
be
careful
that
you
leave
every
bone
as
it
the
king
s
son
fell
into
a
deeper
dread
than
fedelma
when
he
heard
what
she
said
this
can
never
be
he
cried
it
must
be
said
she
and
by
all
your
vows
and
promises
i
command
that
you
do
it
kill
me
now
and
do
as
i
have
bidden
you
if
it
be
done
i
shall
live
if
it
be
not
done
you
will
lose
your
life
and
i
will
never
regain
he
killed
her
he
took
the
bones
as
she
had
bidden
him
and
he
made
steps
down
the
sides
of
the
well
he
searched
at
the
bottom
and
he
found
the
ring
of
youth
he
brought
the
bones
together
again
down
on
his
knees
he
went
and
his
heart
did
not
beat
nor
did
his
breath
come
or
go
until
he
had
fixed
them
in
their
places
over
the
heart
he
placed
the
ring
life
came
back
to
fedelma
you
have
done
well
she
said
one
thing
only
is
not
in
its
place
the
joint
of
my
little
she
held
up
her
hand
and
he
saw
that
her
little
finger
was
bent
i
have
helped
you
in
everything
said
fedelma
and
in
the
last
task
i
could
not
have
helped
you
if
you
had
not
been
true
to
me
when
aefa
and
gilveen
brought
you
to
them
now
the
three
tasks
are
done
and
you
can
ask
my
father
for
one
of
his
daughters
in
marriage
when
you
bring
him
the
ring
of
youth
he
will
ask
you
to
make
a
choice
i
pray
that
the
one
chosen
will
be
none
other
will
i
have
but
you
fedelma
love
of
my
heart
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
viii
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
into
the
house
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
the
enchanter
of
the
black
was
seated
on
his
chair
of
gold
have
you
brought
me
the
ring
of
youth
he
asked
i
have
brought
it
said
the
king
s
son

it
to
me
then
said
the
enchanter
i
will
not

the
king
s
son
until
you
give
what
you
promised
me
at
the
end
of
my
tasks
one
of
your
three
daughters
for
my
the
enchanter
brought
him
to
a
closed
door
my
three
daughters
are
within
that
room
said
he
put
your
hand
through
the
hole
in
the
door
and
the
one
whose
hand
you
hold
when
i
open
it
it
is
she
you
will
have
to
then
wasn
t
the
mind
of
the
king
s
son
greatly
troubled
if
he
held
the
hand
of
aefa
or
gilveen
he
would
lose
his
love
fedelma
he
stood
without
putting
out
his
hand
put
your
hand
through
the
hole
of
the
door
or
go
away
from
my
house
altogether
said
the
enchanter
of
the
black
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
ventured
to
put
his
hand
through
the
hole
in
the
door
the
hands
of
the
maidens
inside
were
all
held
in
a
bunch
but
no
sooner
did
he
touch
them
than
he
found
that
one
had
a
broken
finger
this
he
knew
was
fedelma
s
hand
and
this
was
the
hand
he
held
you
may
open
the
door
now
said
he
to
the
enchanter
he
opened
the
door
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
drew
fedelma
to
him
this
is
the
maiden
i
choose
said
he
and
now
give
her
her
the
dowry
that
should
go
with
me
said
fedelma
is
the
slight
red
what
dowry
do
you
want
with
her
young
man
said
the
enchanter
no
other
dowry
but
the
slight
red
go
round
to
the
stable
then
and
get
it
and
i
hope
no
wizard
like
you
will
come
this
way
no
wizard
am
i
but
the
king
of
s
son
and
i
have
found
your
within
a
year
and
a
day
and
now
i
pluck
the
three
hairs
out
of
your
heard
enchanter
of
the
black
the
beard
of
the
enchanter
bristled
like
spikes
on
a
hedgehog
and
the
balls
of
his
eyes
stuck
out
of
his
head
the
king
s
son
plucked
the
three
hairs
of
his
beard
before
he
could
lift
a
hand
or
say
a
word
mount
the
slight
red
steed
and
be
off
the
two
of
you
said
the
enchanter
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
fedelma
mounted
the
slight
red
steed
and
rode
off
and
the
enchanter
of
the
black
and
his
two
daughters
aefa
and
gilveen
in
a
rage
watched
them
ride
away
ix
they
crossed
the
river
of
the
ox
and
went
over
the
mountain
of
the
fox
and
were
in
the
glen
of
the
badger
before
the
sun
rose
and
there
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
horns
they
found
an
old
man
gathering
dew
from
the
grass
could
you
tell
us
where
we
might
find
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
fedelma
asked
the
old
man
i
am
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
said
he
and
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
to
betroth
us
for
marriage
said
fedelma
i
will
do
that
come
to
my
house
the
pair
of
you
and
as
you
are
both
young
and
better
able
to
walk
than
i
am
it
would
be
fitting
to
let
me
ride
on
your
the
king
s
son
and
fedelma
got
off
and
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
got
on
the
slight
red
steed
they
took
the
path
that
went
round
the
hill
of
horns
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
hill
they
found
a
hut
thatched
with
one
great
wing
of
a
bird
the
little
sage
got
off
the
slight
red
steed
now
said
he
you
re
both
young
and
i
m
an
old
man
and
it
would
be
fitting
for
you
to
do
my
day
s
work
before
you
call
upon
me
to
do
anything
for
you
now
would
you
said
he
to
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
take
this
spade
in
your
hand
and
go
into
the
garden
and
dig
my
potatoes
for
me
and
would
you
said
he
to
fedelma
sit
down
at
the
and
grind
the
wheat
for
me
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
into
the
garden
and
fedelma
sat
at
the
that
was
just
outside
the
door
he
dug
and
she
ground
while
the
little
sage
sat
at
the
fire
looking
into
a
big
book
and
when
fedelma
and
the
king
s
son
were
tired
with
their
labor
he
gave
them
a
drink
of
buttermilk
she
made
cakes
out
of
the
wheat
she
had
ground
and
the
king
s
son
washed
the
potatoes
and
the
little
sage
boiled
them
and
so
they
made
their
supper
then
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
melted
lead
and
made
two
rings
and
one
ring
he
gave
to
fedelma
to
give
to
the
king
s
son
and
one
he
gave
to
the
king
s
son
to
give
to
fedelma
and
when
the
rings
were
given
he
said
you
are
betrothed
for
your
marriage
they
stayed
with
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
that
night
and
when
the
sun
rose
they
left
the
house
that
was
thatched
with
the
great
wing
of
a
bird
and
they
turned
towards
the
meadow
of
brightness
and
the
wood
of
shadows
that
were
between
them
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
domain
they
rode
on
the
slight
red
steed
and
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
went
with
them
a
part
of
the
way
he
seemed
downcast
and
when
they
asked
him
the
reason
he
said
i
see
dividing
ways
and
far
journeys
for
you
but
how
can
that
be
said
the
king
s
son
when
in
a
little
while
we
will
win
to
my
father
s
domain
it
may
be
i
am
wrong
said
the
little
sage
and
if
i
am
not
remember
that
devotion
brings
together
dividing
ways
and
that
high
hearts
win
to
the
end
of
every
he
bade
them
then
and
turned
back
to
his
hut
that
was
thatched
with
the
great
wing
of
a
bird
they
rode
across
the
meadow
of
brightness
and
fedelma
s
blue
falcon
sailed
above
them
yonder
is
a
field
of
white
flowers
said
she
and
while
we
are
crossing
it
you
must
tell
me
a
i
know
by
heart
said
the
king
s
son
only
the
stories
that
maravaun
my
father
s
councillor
has
put
into
the
book
he
is
composing
the
book
that
is
called
the
breastplate
of
then
said
fedelma
tell
me
a
story
from
the
breastplate
of
instruction
while
we
are
crossing
this
field
of
white
i
will
tell
you
the
first
story
that
is
in
it
said
the
king
s
son
then
while
they
were
crossing
the
field
of
white
flowers
the
king
s
son
told
fedelma
the
story
of
the
ass
and
the
seal
x
a
seal
that
had
spent
a
curious
paddling
around
the
island
of
drew
itself
up
on
a
rock
the
better
to
carry
on
its
investigations
it
was
now
within
five
yards
of
the
actual
island
on
the
little
beach
there
were
three
curraghs
in
which
the
went
over
the
sea
they
were
turned
bottom
up
and
heavy
stones
were
placed
upon
them
to
prevent
their
being
carried
away
by
the
high
winds
the
seal
noted
them
as
he
rested
upon
the
flat
rock
he
noted
too
a
little
ass
that
was
standing
beyond
the
curraghs
sheltering
himself
where
the
cliffs
hollowed
in
now
this
ass
was
as
curious
as
the
seal
and
when
he
saw
the
smooth
creature
that
was
moving
its
head
about
with
such
intelligence
he
came
down
to
the
water
s
edge
two
of
his
legs
were
spancelled
with
a
piece
of
straw
rope
but
being
used
to
such
impediment
he
came
over
without
any
awkwardness
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
seal
the
crow
of
the
cliff
lighted
on
a
spar
of
rock
and
made
herself
an
interpreter
between
the
two
shaggy
beast
of
the
island
said
the
seal
friend
and
follower
of
men
tell
me
about
their
fabulous
do
you
mean
the
said
the
ass
you
know
well
whom
he
means
said
the
crow
viciously
answer
him
you
gravell
me
entirely
when
you
ask
about
men
said
the
ass
i
don
t
know
much
about
them
they
live
to
themselves
and
i
live
to
myself
their
houses
are
full
of
smoke
and
it
blinds
my
eyes
to
go
in
there
used
to
be
green
fields
here
and
high
grass
that
became
hay
but
there
s
nothing
like
that
now
i
think
men
have
given
up
eating
what
grows
out
of
the
ground
i
see
nothing
i
smell
nothing
but
fish
fish
the
crow
had
a
vicious
eye
fixed
on
the
ass
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
you
re
saying
all
that
said
she
because
they
let
the
little
horse
stay
all
night
in
the
house
and
beat
you
out
of
my
friend
said
the
seal
it
is
evident
that
men
deceive
you
by
appearances
i
know
men
i
have
followed
their
boats
and
have
listened
to
the
wonderful
sounds
they
make
with
their
voices
and
with
instruments
do
they
not
draw
fish
out
of
the
depths
by
enchantments
do
they
not
build
their
habitations
with
music
do
they
not
draw
the
moon
out
of
the
sea
and
set
it
for
a
light
in
their
houses
and
is
it
not
known
that
the
fairest
daughters
of
the
sea
have
loved
men
when
i
m
awake
long
o
moonlit
nights
i
feel
like
that
myself
said
the
ass
then
the
recollections
of
these
long
frosty
nights
made
him
yawn
then
he
brayed
what
it
is
to
live
near
men
said
the
seal
in
admiration
what
wonderful
sounds
i
d
cross
the
water
and
rub
noses
with
you
said
the
ass
only
i
m
afraid
of
crocodiles
said
the
crow
yes
said
the
ass
it
s
because
i
m
of
a
very
old
family
you
know
they
were
egyptians
my
people
never
liked
to
cross
water
in
their
own
country
there
were
crocodiles
i
don
t
want
to
waste
any
more
time
listening
to
nonsense
said
the
crow
she
flew
to
the
ass
s
back
and
plucked
out
some
of
the
felt
i
ll
take
this
for
my
own
habitation
she
said
and
flew
back
to
the
cliff
the
ass
would
have
kicked
up
his
heels
only
two
of
his
legs
were
fastened
with
the
straw
rope
he
turned
away
and
without
a
word
of
farewell
to
the
seal
went
scrambling
up
the
bank
of
the
island
the
seal
stayed
for
a
while
moving
his
head
about
intelligently
then
he
slipped
into
the
water
and
paddled
off
one
feels
their
lives
in
music
he
said
great
tones
vibrate
round
the
island
where
men
live
it
is
very
that
said
the
king
s
son
is
the
first
story
in
the
breastplate
of
instruction
the
ass
and
the
and
now
you
must
tell
me
a
story
while
we
are
crossing
the
field
of
blue
then
it
will
be
a
very
little
story
said
fedelma
they
crossed
a
little
field
of
blue
flowers
and
fedelma
told
the
sending
of
the
crystal
egg
xi
the
kings
of
murias
heard
that
king
atlas
had
to
bear
the
world
upon
his
back
so
they
sent
him
then
and
there
the
crystal
egg
that
would
be
the
swan
of
endless
tales
that
his
burthen
for
a
while
might
lie
on
his
while
he
heard
the
tales
the
swan
poured
forth
tales
for
the
while
he
watched
the
star
of
the
north
and
tales
he
would
hear
in
the
morning
swart
and
cool
when
the
lions
nimrod
had
spared
came
up
from
the
drinking
pool
tales
for
the
king
when
he
turned
him
with
the
sun
then
whispers
of
magic
tales
from
africa
his
own
but
the
kings
of
murias
made
the
crane
their
messenger
the
fitful
crane
whose
thoughts
are
always
frightening
her
she
slipped
from
islet
to
isle
she
sloped
from
foreland
to
coast
she
passed
through
cracks
in
the
mountains
and
came
over
trees
like
a
ghost
and
then
fled
back
in
dismay
when
she
saw
on
the
hollow
plains
the
final
battle
between
the
pigmies
and
the
cranes
where
is
the
crystal
egg
that
was
sent
king
atlas
then
hatched
it
will
be
one
day
and
the
tales
will
be
told
to
men
that
is
if
it
be
not
laid
in
some
king
s
old
treasury
that
is
if
the
fitful
crane
did
not
lose
it
threading
the
sea
they
were
not
long
going
through
the
little
field
of
blue
flowers
and
when
they
went
through
it
they
came
to
another
field
of
white
flowers
fedelma
asked
the
king
s
son
to
tell
her
another
story
and
thereupon
he
told
her
the
second
story
in
the
breastplate
of
the
story
of
the
young
cuckoo
xii
the
young
cuckoo
made
desperate
attempts
to
get
himself
through
the
narrow
opening
in
the
hollow
tree
he
screamed
when
he
failed
to
get
through
his
had
remained
so
long
beside
him
that
they
were
wasted
and
sad
while
the
other
birds
their
broods
reared
were
vigorous
and
joyful
they
heard
the
one
that
had
been
reared
in
their
nest
the
young
cuckoo
scream
but
this
time
they
did
not
fly
towards
him
the
young
cuckoo
screamed
again
but
there
was
something
in
that
scream
that
reminded
the
of
hawks
they
flew
away
they
were
miserable
in
their
flight
these
birds
for
they
knew
they
were
committing
a
treason
they
had
built
their
nest
in
a
hollow
tree
that
had
a
little
opening
a
cuckoo
laid
her
egg
on
the
ground
and
carrying
it
in
her
beak
had
placed
it
in
the
nest
their
own
young
had
been
pushed
out
they
had
worn
themselves
to
get
provision
for
the
terrible
and
fascinating
creature
who
had
remained
in
their
nest
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
make
his
flight
he
could
not
get
his
body
through
the
little
opening
yesterday
he
had
begun
to
try
the
two
flew
to
him
again
and
again
with
food
but
now
their
own
nesting
place
had
become
strange
to
them
they
would
never
go
near
it
again
the
young
cuckoo
was
forsaken
a
woodpecker
ran
round
the
tree
he
looked
into
the
hollow
and
saw
the
big
bird
crumpled
up
hello
said
the
woodpecker
how
did
you
get
here
born
here
said
the
young
cuckoo
sulkily
oh
were
you
said
the
woodpecker
and
he
ran
round
the
tree
again
when
he
came
back
to
the
opening
the
young
cuckoo
was
standing
up
with
his
mouth
open
feed
me
said
he
i
ve
to
rush
round
frightfully
to
get
something
for
myself
said
the
woodpecker
at
least
someone
ought
to
bring
me
food
said
the
young
cuckoo
how
is
that
said
the
woodpecker
well
oughtn
t
they
to
said
the
young
cuckoo
i
wouldn
t
say
so
said
the
woodpecker
you
have
the
use
of
your
wits
haven
t
you
he
ran
round
the
trunk
of
the
tree
again
and
devoured
a
lean
grub
the
young
cuckoo
struggled
at
the
opening
and
screamed
again
don
t
be
drawing
too
much
attention
to
yourself
advised
the
woodpecker
when
he
came
to
the
opening
again
they
might
take
you
for
a
young
hawk
you
who
might
said
the
cuckoo
the
neighbors
they
would
pull
a
young
hawk
to
what
am
i
to
do
said
the
young
cuckoo
what
s
in
your
nature
to
do
my
nature
said
the
young
cuckoo
it
s
my
nature
to
swing
myself
on
branches
high
up
in
a
tree
it
s
my
nature
to
spread
out
my
wings
and
fly
over
pleasant
places
it
is
my
nature
to
be
alone
but
not
alone
as
here
alone
with
the
sound
of
my
own
suddenly
he
cried
cuckoo
cuckoo
cuckoo
i
know
you
now
said
the
woodpecker
there
s
going
to
be
a
storm
he
said
trust
a
woodpecker
to
know
the
young
cuckoo
strove
towards
the
big
sky
again
and
he
screamed
so
viciously
that
a
rat
that
had
just
come
out
of
the
ditch
fastened
his
eyes
on
him
that
creature
looked
bad
to
the
young
cuckoo
rain
plopped
on
the
leaves
thunder
crashed
a
bolt
struck
the
tree
and
the
part
above
the
opening
was
torn
away
the
young
cuckoo
flung
himself
out
on
the
grass
and
went
awkwardly
amongst
the
blue
bells
what
a
world
said
he
all
this
wet
and
fire
and
noise
to
get
me
out
of
the
nest
what
a
world
the
young
cuckoo
was
free
and
these
were
the
first
words
he
said
when
he
went
into
the
world
that
was
the
last
story
the
king
s
son
told
from
maravaun
s
book
the
breastplate
of
they
had
another
little
field
of
blue
flowers
to
cross
and
as
they
went
across
it
fedelma
told
the
king
s
son
the
story
of
the
xiii
the
mor
was
the
daughter
of
griann
the
sun
well
and
she
made
a
marriage
to

that
grandeur
for
her
goodman
was
lir
the

the
mor
she
had
seven
strong
sons
and
the
say
their
inches
grew
in
the
and
grew
over
again
in
the
day
the
mor
as
they
grew
in
their
bone
she
grew
in
her
pride
till
her
haughtiness
turned
away
men
say
her
goodman
lir
from
her
side
then
she
lived
in
mor
s
home
and
she
watched
with
pride
her
sons
and
her
crop
till
one
day
the
wish
in
her
grew
to
view
from
the
all
all
that
she
owned
so
she
traveled
without
any
stop
and
what
did
she
see
a
thousand
fields
and
her
own
fields
small
small
what
a
fine
and
wide
place
is
eirinn
said
she
i
am
mor
but
not
great
after
then
a
herdsman
came
and
he
told
her
that
her
sons
had
stolen
away
they
had
left
the
calves
in
the
hollow
with
the

would
not
stay
they
had
seen
three
ships
on
the
sea
and
nothing
would
do
them
but
go
mor
wept
and
wept
when
she
heard
it
and
her
tears
made
runnels
below
then
her
shining
splendor
departed
she
went
and
she
left
no
trace
and
the
mor
was
never
beheld
again
in
that
place
the
proud
woman
mor
who
was
daughter
of
griann
the
sun
and
who
made
a
marriage
to
equal
that
grandeur
passed
away
as
a
shade
xiv
and
that
was
the
last
story
that
fedelma
told
for
they
had
crossed
the
meadows
of
brightness
and
had
come
to
a
nameless
place
a
stretch
of
broken
ground
where
there
were
black
rocks
and
dead
grass
and
bare
roots
of
trees
with
here
and
there
a
hawthorn
tree
in
blossom
i
fear
this
place
we
must
not
halt
here
fedelma
said
and
then
a
flock
of
ravens
came
from
the
rocks
and
flying
straight
at
them
attacked
fedelma
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
king
s
son
sprang
from
the
steed
and
taking
his
sword
in
his
hand
he
fought
the
ravens
until
he
drove
them
away
they
rode
on
again
but
now
the
ravens
flew
back
and
attacked
them
again
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
fought
them
until
his
hands
were
wearied
he
mounted
the
steed
again
and
they
rode
swiftly
on
and
the
ravens
came
the
third
time
and
attacked
them
more
fiercely
than
before
the
king
s
son
fought
them
until
he
had
killed
all
but
three
and
until
he
was
covered
with
their
blood
and
feathers
the
three
that
had
escaped
flew
away
oh
mount
the
slight
red
steed
and
let
us
ride
fast
said
fedelma
to
the
king
s
son
i
am
filled
with
weariness
he
said
bid
the
steed
stay
by
the
rock
lay
my
sword
at
my
side
and
let
me
sleep
with
my
head
on
your
i
fear
for
us
both
if
you
slumber
here
said
fedelma
i
must
sleep
and
i
pray
that
you
let
me
lay
my
head
on
your

know
not
what

awaken
you

the
king

son
but
now
i
must
sleep
and
i
would
slumber
with
my
head
on
your
she
got
down
from
the
slight
red
steed
and
she
bade
it
stay
by
a
rock
she
put
his
sword
by
the
place
he
would
sleep
and
she
took
his
head
upon
her
lap
the
king
s
son
slept
as
she
watched
over
him
a
great
fear
grew
in
fedelma
every
hour
she
would
say
to
him
are
you
near
waking
my
dear
my
dear
but
no
flush
of
waking
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
then
she
saw
a
man
coming
across
the
nameless
place
across
the
broken
ground
with
its
dead
grass
and
black
rocks
and
with
its
roots
and
stumps
of
trees
the
man
who
came
near
them
was
taller
than
any
man
she
had
seen
before
he
was
tall
as
a
tree
fedelma
knew
him
from
what
she
had
heard
told
about
him
she
knew
him
to
be
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
came
straight
to
them
he
stood
before
fedelma
and
he
said

of
the
enchanter
of
the
black

then
the
king
of

high
he
held
him

held
up
the
king
of

son
again
and
again
he
was
about
to

him
against

rocks

blue
falcon

down
and

on
the
rock

and
gave

she
held

flowers
against

and
fell
into
slumber

were
side

side
in
sleep
then
the
king
of

took
fedelma
in

arms
and
strode
along
that
nameless
place
over
the
broken
ground
with
its
dead
grass
and
its
black
rocks
and
its
stumps
and
roots
of
trees
and
the
three
ravens

roots
of
trees

remembered
he
had
come
to
it

he
sprang
up
and
looked
for
her
but
no
one
was
near
him
fedelma
fedelma
he
searched
and
he
called
but
it
was
as
if
no
one
had
ever
been
with
him
he
found
his
sword
be
searched
for
his
steed
but
the
slight
red
steed
was
gone
too
he
thought
that
the
enchanter
of
the
black
had
followed
them
and
had
taken
fedelma
from
him
he
turned
to
go
towards
the
enchanter
s
country
and
then
he
found
what
fedelma
had
written
upon
the
ground
in
ogham
letters
iiii
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
he
did
not
know
what
direction
to
take
to
get
to
the
dominion
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
he
crossed
the
broken
ground
and
he
found
no
trace
of
fedelma
nor
of
him
who
had
taken
her
he
found
himself
close
to
the
wood
of
shadows
he
went
through
it
as
he
went
on
he
saw
scores
and
scores
of
shadows
nothing
else
was
in
the
wood
no
bird
no
squirrel
no
cricket
the
shadows
had
the
whole
wood
to
themselves
they
ran
swiftly
from
tree
to
tree
and
now
and
then
one
would
stop
at
a
tree
and
wait
often
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
came
close
to
a
waiting
shadow
one
became
like
a
small
old
man
with
a
beard
the
king
s
son
saw
this
shadow
again
and
again
what
were
they
the
shadows
he
asked
himself
maybe
they
were
wise
creatures
and
could
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
he
thought
he
heard
them
whispering
together
then
one
little
shadow
with
trailing
legs
went
slowly
from
tree
to
tree
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
thought
he
would
catch
and
hold
a
shadow
and
make
it
tell
him
where
he
should
go
to
find
the
dominion
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
he
went
after
one
shadow
and
another
and
waited
beside
a
tree
for
one
to
come
often
he
thought
he
saw
the
small
old
man
with
the
beard
and
the
little
creature
with
trailing
legs
and
then
he
began
to
see
other
shadows
men
with
the
heads
of
rooks
and
men
with
queer
heavy
swords
upon
their
shoulders
he
followed
them
on
and
on
through
the
wood
and
he
heard
their
whispering
becoming
louder
and
louder
and
then
he
thought
that
as
he
went
on
the
shadows
instead
of
slipping
before
him
began
to
turn
back
and
go
past
and
surround
him
then
he
heard
a
voice
just
under
the
ground
at
his
feet
say
shout
shout
out
your
own
name
son
of
king
connal
then
the
king
s
son
shouted
out
his
own
name
and
the
whispers
ceased
in
the
wood
and
the
shadows
went
backward
and
forward
no
more
he
went
on
and
came
to
a
stream
within
the
wood
and
he
went
against
its
flow
all
night
as
well
as
all
day
hoping
to
meet
some
living
thing
that
would
tell
him
how
he
might
come
to
the
dominion
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
in
the
forenoon
of
another
day
he
came
to
where
the
wood
grew
thin
and
then
he
went
past
the
last
trees
he
saw
a
horse
grazing
he
ran
up
to
it
and
found
that
it
was
the
slight
red
steed
that
had
carried
fedelma
and
himself
from
the
house
of
the
enchanter
then
as
he
laid
hold
of
the
steed
a
hound
ran
up
to
him
and
a
hawk
flew
down
and
he
saw
that
they
were
the
hawk
and
the
hound
that
used
to
be
with
him
when
he
rode
abroad
from
his
father
s
castle
he
mounted
and
seeing
his
hound
at
his
heel
and
his
hawk
circling
above
he
felt
a
longing
to
go
back
to
his
father
s
castle
which
he
knew
to
be
near
and
where
he
might
find
out
where
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
had
his
dominion
so
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rode
back
to
his
father
s
castle
his
hound
at
his
heel
his
hawk
on
his
wrist
when
the
king
of
the
cats
came
to
king
connal
s
dominion
i
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
home
again
but
as
he
kept
asking
about
a
king
and
a
kingdom
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
people
thought
he
had
lost
his
wits
in
his
search
for
the
enchanter
of
the
black
he
rode
abroad
every
day
to
ask
strangers
if
they
knew
where
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
had
his
dominion
and
he
came
back
to
his
father
s
every
night
in
the
hope
that
one
would
be
at
the
castle
who
could
tell
him
where
the
place
that
he
sought
was
maravaun
wanted
to
relate
to
him
fables
from
the
breastplate
of
instruction
but
the
king
s
son
did
not
hear
a
word
that
maravaun
said
after
a
while
he
listened
to
the
things
that
art
the
king
s
steward
related
to
him
for
it
was
art
who
had
shown
the
king
s
son
the
leaden
ring
that
was
on
his
finger
he
took
it
off
remembering
the
betrothal
ring
that
the
little
sage
had
made
and
then
he
saw
that
it
was
not
his
but
fedelma
s
ring
that
he
wore
then
he
felt
as
if
fedelma
had
sent
a
message
to
him
and
he
was
less
wild
in
his
thoughts
afterwards
in
the
evenings
when
he
came
back
from
his
ridings
he
would
cross
the
meadows
with
art
the
king
s
steward
or
would
stand
with
him
while
the
herdsmen
drove
the
cattle
into
the
byres
then
he
would
listen
to
what
art
related
to
him
and
one
evening
he
heard
art
say
the
most
remarkable
event
that
happened
was
the
coming
into
this
land
of
the
king
of
the
i
will
listen
to
what
you
tell
me
about
it
said
the
king
s
son
then
said
art
the
king
s
steward
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth
be
it
told
the
king
of
the
cats
stood
up
he
was
a
grand
creature
his
body
was
brown
and
striped
across
as
if
one
had
burned
on
wood
with
a
hot
poker
like
all
the
race
of
the
royal
cats
of
the
isle
of
man
he
was
without
a
tail
but
he
had
extraordinarily
fine
whiskers
they
went
each
side
of
his
face
to
the
length
of
a
he
had
such
eyes
that
when
he
turned
one
of
them
upward
the
bird
that
was
flying
across
dropped
from
the
sky
and
when
he
turned
the
other
one
down
he
could
make
a
hole
in
the
floor
he
lived
in
the
isle
of
man
once
he
had
been
king
of
the
cats
of
ireland
and
britain
of
norway
and
denmark
and
the
whole
northern
and
western
world
but
after
the
norsemen
won
in
the
wars
the
cats
of
norway
and
britain
swore
by
thor
and
odin
that
they
would
give
him
no
more
allegiance
so
for
a
hundred
years
and
a
day
he
had
got
allegiance
only
from
the
cats
of
the
western
world
that
is
from
ireland
and
the
islands
beyond
the
tribute
he
received
was
still
worth
having
in
may
he
was
sent
a
boatful
of
herring
in
august
he
was
let
have
two
boatfuls
of
mackerel
in
november
he
was
given
five
barrels
of
preserved
mice
at
other
seasons
he
had
for
his
tribute
one
out
of
every
hundred
birds
that
flew
across
the
island
on
their
way
to
ireland
tomtits
linnets
siskins
starlings
martins
wrens
and
tender
young
barn
owls
he
was
also
sent
the
following
as
marks
of
allegiance
and
respect
a
salmon
to
show
his
dominion
over
the
rivers
the
skin
of
a
marten
to
show
his
dominion
in
the
woods
a
live
cricket
to
show
his
dominion
in
the
houses
of
men
the
horn
of
a
cow
to
show
his
right
to
a
portion
of
the
milk
produced
in
the
western
world
but
the
tribute
from
the
western
world
became
smaller
and
smaller
one
year
the
boat
did
not
come
with
the
herring
mackerel
was
sent
to
him
afterwards
but
he
knew
it
was
sent
to
him
because
so
much
was
being
taken
out
of
the
sea
that
the
were
plowing
their
into
the
land
to
make
their
crops
grow
then
a
year
came
when
he
got
neither
the
salmon
nor
the
marten
skin
neither
the
live
cricket
nor
the
cow
s
horn
then
he
got
righteously
and
royally
indignant
he
stood
up
on
his
four
paws
on
the
floor
of
his
palace
and
declared
to
his
wife
that
he
himself
was
going
to
ireland
to
know
what
prevented
the
sending
of
his
lawful
tribute
to
him
he
called
for
his
prime
minister
then
and
said
prepare
for
us
our
speech
from
the
the
prime
minister
went
to
the
parliament
house
and
wrote
down
oyez
oyez
oyez
but
he
could
not
remember
any
more
of
the
ancient
language
in
which
the
speeches
from
the
throne
were
always
written
he
went
home
and
hanged
himself
with
a
measure
of
tape
and
his
wife
buried
the
body
under
the
speech
or
no
speech
said
the
king
of
the
cats
i
m
going
to
pay
a
royal
visit
to
my
subjects
in
he
went
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
he
made
a
spring
he
landed
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
that
was
bringing
the
king
of
norway
s
daughter
to
be
married
to
the
king
of
scotland
s
son
the
ship
nearly
sank
with
the
crash
of
his
body
on
it
he
ran
up
the
sails
and
placed
himself
on
the
mast
of
the
ship
there
he
gathered
his
feet
together
and
made
another
spring
this
time
he
landed
on
a
boat
that
was
bringing
to
build
a
king
s
palace
in
london
he
stood
where
the
timber
was
highest
and
made
another
spring
this
time
he
landed
on
the
giant
s
causeway
that
runs
from
ireland
out
into
the
sea
he
picked
his
steps
from
boulder
to
boulder
and
then
walked
royally
and
resolutely
on
the
ground
of
ireland
a
man
was
riding
on
horseback
with
a
woman
seated
on
the
saddle
behind
him
the
king
of
the
cats
waited
until
they
came
up
my
good
man
said
he
very
grandly
when
you
go
back
to
your
house
tell
the
cat
in
the
corner
that
the
king
of
the
cats
has
come
to
ireland
to
see
his
manner
was
so
grand
that
the
man
took
off
his
hat
and
the
woman
made
a
courtesy
then
the
king
of
the
cats
sprang
into
the
branch
of
a
tree
of
the
forest
and
slept
till
it
was
past
the
heat
i
nearly
forgot
to
tell
you
that
as
he
slept
on
the
branch
his
whiskers
stood
around
his
face
the
breadth
of
a
either
way
ii
the
next
day
the
king
s
son
rode
abroad
and
where
he
went
that
day
he
saw
no
man
nor
woman
nor
living
creature
in
the
land
around
but
coming
back
he
saw
a
falcon
sailing
in
the
air
above
he
rode
on
and
the
falcon
sailed
above
never
rising
high
in
the
air
and
never
swooping
down
the
king
s
son
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
and
shot
at
the
falcon
immediately
it
rose
in
the
air
and
flew
swiftly
away
but
a
feather
from
it
fell
before
him
the
king
s
son
picked
the
feather
up
it
was
a
blue
feather
then
the
king
s
son
thought
of
fedelma
s
falcon
of
the
bird
that
flew
above
them
when
they
rode
across
the
meadows
of
brightness
it
might
be
fedelma
s
falcon
the
one
he
had
shot
at
and
it
might
have
come
to
show
him
the
way
to
the
land
of
mist
but
the
falcon
was
not
to
be
seen
now
he
did
not
go
amongst
the
strangers
in
his
father
s
castle
that
evening
but
he
stood
with
art
who
was
watching
the
herdsmen
drive
the
cattle
into
the
byres
and
art
after
a
while
said
i
will
tell
you
more
about
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
cats
into
king
connal
s
dominion
and
as
before
i
say
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth
be
it
told
the
king
of
the
cats
waited
on
the
branch
of
the
tree
until
the
moon
was
in
the
sky
like
a
roast
duck
on
a
dish
of
gold
and
still
neither
retainer
vassal
nor
subject
came
to
do
him
service
he
was
vexed
i
tell
you
at
the
want
of
respect
shown
him
this
was
the
reason
why
none
of
his
subjects
came
to
him
for
such
a
long
time
the
man
and
woman
he
had
spoken
to
went
into
their
house
and
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
king
of
the
cats
until
they
had
eaten
their
supper
then
when
the
man
had
smoked
his
second
pipe
he
said
to
the
woman
that
was
a
wonderful
thing
that
happened
to
us
a
cat
to
walk
up
to
two
christians
and
say
to
them
tell
the
ashy
pet
in
your
chimney
corner
at
home
that
the
king
of
the
cats
has
come
to
see
no
sooner
were
the
words
said
than
the
lean
gray
cat
that
lay
on
the
hearthstone
sprang
on
the
back
of
the
man
s
chair
i
will
say
this
said
the
man
it
s
a
bad
time
when
two
christians
like
ourselves
are
stopped
on
their
way
back
from
the
market
and
ordered
ordered
no
less
to
give
a
message
to
one
s
own
cat
lying
on
one
s
own
by
my
fur
and
daws
you
re
a
long
time
coming
to
his
message
said
the
cat
on
the
back
of
the
chair
what
was
it
anyway
the
king
of
the
cats
has
come
to
ireland
to
see
you
said
the
man
very
much
surprised
it
s
a
wonder
you
told
it
at
all
said
the
cat
going
to
the
door
and
where
did
you
see
his
majesty
you
shouldn
t
have
spoken
said
the
man
s
wife
and
how
did
i
know
a
cat
could
understand
said
the
man
when
you
have
done
talking
amongst
yourselves
said
the
cat
would
you
tell
me
where
you
met
his
majesty
nothing
will
i
tell
you
said
the
man
until
i
hear
your
own
name
from
my
name
said
the
cat
is
and
well
you
should
know
not
a
word
will
we
tell
you
said
the
woman
until
we
hear
what
the
king
of
the
cats
is
doing
in
ireland
is
he
bringing
wars
and
rebellions
into
the
country
wars
and
rebellions
no
ma
am
said
but
deliverance
from
oppression
why
are
the
cats
of
the
country
lean
and
lazy
and
covered
with
ashes
it
is
because
the
cat
that
goes
outside
the
house
in
the
sunlight
to
hunt
or
to
play
is
made
to
suffer
with
the
loss
of
an
and
who
makes
them
suffer
with
the
loss
of
an
eye
said
the
woman
one
whose
reign
is
nearly
over
now
said
but
tell
me
where
you
saw
his
majesty
no
said
the
man
no
said
the
woman
for
we
don
t
like
your
impertinence
back
with
you
to
the
hearthstone
and
watch
the
for
walked
straight
out
of
the
door
may
no
prosperity
come
to
this
house
said
he
for
denying
me
when
i
asked
where
the
king
of
the
cats
was
pleased
to
speak
to
but
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
when
he
went
outside
and
he
heard
the
woman
say
the
horse
will
tell
him
that
we
saw
the
king
of
the
cats
a
mile
this
side
of
the
giant
s
that
was
a
mistake
the
horse
could
not
have
told
it
at
all
because
horses
never
know
the
language
that
is
spoken
in
houses
only
cats
know
it
fully
and
dogs
know
a
little
of
it
now
knew
where
the
king
of
the
cats
might
be
found
he
went
creeping
by
hedges
loping
across
fields
bounding
through
woods
until
he
came
under
the
branch
in
the
forest
where
the
king
of
the
cats
rested
his
whiskers
standing
round
his
face
the
breadth
of

round
his
neck
then
the
king
and
his
prime
minister
parted
the
king
of
the
cats
took
up
quarters
for
a
day
or
two
in
a
round
tower
made
a
journey
through
the
he
went
into
every
house
and
whispered
a
word
to
every
cat
that
was
there
and
whether
the
cat
was
watching
a
or
chasing
crickets
or
playing
with
kittens
when
he
or
she
heard
that
word
they
sat
up
and
considered
iii
early
early
next
day
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rode
out
in
search
of
the
blue
falcon
but
although
he
rode
from
the
ring
of
day
to
the
gathering
of
the
dark
clouds
he
saw
no
sign
of
it
on
rock
or
tree
or
in
the
air
very
wearily
he
rode
back
and
after
his
horse
was
stabled
he
stood
with
art
in
the
meadows
watching
the
cattle
being
driven
by
and
art
the
king
s
steward
said
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
cats
into
king
connal
s
dominion
is
a
story
still
to
be
told
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth
be
it
told
in
consultation
with
the
seven
elders
of
the
decided
that
the
blacksmith
s
forge
would
be
a
fit
residence
for
the
king
of
the
cats
it
was
clean
and
commodious
but
the
best
reason
of
all
for
his
going
there
was
this
people
and
beasts
from
all
parts
came
into
the
forge
and
the
king
of
the
cats
might
learn
from
their
discussions
where
the
was
and
how
he
might
be
destroyed
his
majesty
found
that
the
forge
was
not
a
bad
residence
for
a
king
living
unbeknownst
it
was
dry
and
warm
he
liked
the
look
of
the
flames
that
mounted
up
with
the
blowing
of
the
bellows
he
used
to
sit
on
a
heap
of
old
saddles
on
the
floor
and
watch
the
horses
being
shod
or
waiting
to
be
shod
he
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
men
the
people
in
the
forge
treated
him
respectfully
and
often
referred
to
his
size
his
appearance
and
his
fine
manners
every
night
he
went
out
to
a
feast
that
the
cats
had
prepared
for
him
always
walked
back
to
the
forge
with
him
to
give
a
prime
minister
s
advice
he
warned
his
majesty
not
to
let
the
human
beings
know
that
he
understood
and
could
converse
in
their
language
all
cats
know
men
s
language
but
men
do
not
know
that
the
cats
know
he
told
him
not
to
be
too
haughty
as
a
king
might
be
inclined
to
be
to
any
creature
in
the
forge
the
king
of
the
cats
took
this
advice
he
used
even
to
twitch
his
ears
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
mahon
the
hound
whose
kennel
was
just
outside
the
forge
and
to
the
hounds
that
mahon
had
to
visit
him
he
even
made
advances
to
the
cock
who
walked
up
and
down
outside
this
cock
made
himself
very
annoying
to
the
king
of
the
cats
he
used
to
strut
up
and
down
saying
to
himself
over
and
over
again
i
m
i
m
sometimes
he
would
come
into
the
forge
and
say
it
to
the
horses
the
king
of
the
cats
wondered
how
the
human
beings
could
put
up
with
a
creature
who
was
so
stupid
and
so
vain
he
had
a
red
comb
that
fell
over
one
eye
he
had
purple
feathers
on
his
tail
he
had
great
spurs
on
his
heels
he
used
to
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
yawn
when
the
king
of
the
cats
appeared
used
to
come
into
the
forge
at
night
and
sleep
on
the
bellows
and
when
the
king
of
the
cats
came
back
from
the
feasts
he
used
to
waken
up
and
say
to
himself
i
m
i
m
the
cats
are
not
a
respectable
one
noonday
there
were
men
in
the
forge
they
were
talking
to
the
smith
said
one
could
you
tell
us
smith
where
iron
came
from
the
king
of
the
cats
knew
but
he
said
nothing
came
to
the
door
and
held
his
head
as
if
he
were
listening
i
can
t
tell
where
iron
came
from
said
the
smith
but
if
that
cock
could
talk
he
could
tell
you
the
world
knows
that
the
cock
is
the
wisest
and
the
most
ancient
of
i
m
said
the
cock
to
a
rusty
ass
s
shoe
yes
the
cock
is
a
wonderful
creature
said
the
man
who
had
asked
the
question
not
wonderful
at
all
said
the
king
of
the
cats
and
if
you
had
asked
me
i
could
have
told
you
where
iron
came
and
where
did
iron
come
from
said
the
smith
from
the
mountains
of
the
moon
said
the
king
of
the
cats
the
men
in
the
forge
put
their
hands
on
their
knees
and
looked
down
at
him
mahon
the
hound
came
into
the
forge
with
other
hounds
at
his
tail
and
seeing
the
men
looking
at
the
king
of
the
cats
mahon
put
his
nose
to
him
flapped
his
wings
insolently
the
king
of
the
cats
struck
at
the
red
hanging
comb
with
his
paw
the
cock
flew
up
in
the
air
the
king
of
the
cats
sprang
out
of
the
window
and
as
he
did
mahon
and
the
other
hounds
sprang
after
him
iv
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rode
towards
the
east
the
next
day
and
in
the
first
hour
s
journey
he
saw
the
blue
falcon
sailing
above
he
followed
where
it
went
and
the
falcon
never
lifted
nor
stooped
but
sailed
steadily
on
only
now
and
again
beating
the
air
with
its
wings
over
benns
and
through
glens
and
across
moors
the
blue
falcon
flew
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
followed
then
his
horse
stumbled
he
could
not
go
any
further
and
he
lost
sight
of
the
blue
falcon
black
night
was
falling
down
on
the
ground
when
he
came
back
to
the
king
s
castle
art
the
king
s
steward
was
waiting
for
him
and
he
walked
beside
his
limping
horse
and
art
said
when
they
were
a
little
way
together
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
cats
is
a
story
still
to
be
told
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth
be
it
told
by
the
magic
powers
they
possessed
it
was
made
known
to
all
the
cats
in
the
country
that
their
king
was
being
pursued
by
the
hounds
then
on
every
hearthstone
a
cat
howled
cats
sprang
to
the
doors
overturning
cradles
upon
children
they
stood
upon
the
thresholds
and
they
all
made
the
same
curse
that
ye
may
break
your
backs
that
ye
may
break
your
backs
before
ye
catch
the
king
of
the
when
he
heard
the
howls
of
his
vassals
retainers
and
subjects
the
king
of
the
cats
turned
over
on
his
back
and
clawed
at
the
first
hound
that
came
after
him
he
stood
up
then
so
firmly
did
he
set
himself
on
his
four
legs
that
those
that
dashed
at
him
did
not
overthrow
him
he
humped
up
his
body
and
lifted
his
forepaws
the
hounds
held
back
a
horn
sounded
and
that
gave
them
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
the
claws
and
the
teeth
the
power
and
the
animosity
of
the
king
of
the
cats
then
even
though
it
might
cost
each
and
every
one
of
them
the
loss
of
an
eye
the
cats
that
had
sight
of
him
came
running
up
we
will
go
with
you
my
lord
we
will
help
you
my
lord
they
cried
all
together
go
back
to
the
hearthstones
said
the
king
of
the
cats
go
back
and
be
civil
and
quiet
again
in
the
houses
you
will
hear
of
my
deeds
i
go
to
find
the
tracks
of
our
enemy
the
when
they
heard
that
announcement
the
cats
lamented
and
the
noise
of
their
lamentation
was
so
dreadful
that
horses
broke
their
harnesses
where
they
were
yoked
men
and
women
lost
the
color
of
their
faces
thinking
some
dreadful
visitation
was
coming
on
the
land
every
bag
of
oats
and
rye
turned
five
times
to
the
right
and
five
times
to
the
left
with
the
fright
it
got
dishes
were
broken
knives
were
hurled
round
and
the
king
s
castle
was
shaken
to
the
bottom
stone
it
is
not
the
time
to
seek
the
tracks
of
the
said
stay
for
a
while
longer
in
men
s
never
said
the
king
of
the
cats
never
will
i
stay
by
the
hearthstone
and
submit
to
be
abused
by
cocks
and
hounds
and
men
i
will
range
the
world
openly
now
and
seek
out
the
enemy
of
the
the
without
once
turning
his
back
he
went
towards
the
wood
that
was
filled
with
his
enemies
the
birds
the
cats
when
they
saw
their
petitions
were
no
use
went
everyone
back
to
the
house
where
he
or
she
stayed
each
one
sat
before
a
and
pretended
to
be
watching
but
though
mice
stirred
all
round
them
the
cats
of
ireland
never
turned
a
head
that
night
it
was
the
wren
the
smallest
of
birds
that
saw
him
and
knew
him
for
the
king
of
the
cats
the
wren
flew
through
the
wood
to
summon
the
but
it
was
towards
sunset
now
and
the
hawks
had
taken
up
their
stations
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
watch
that
they
might
pick
up
the
farmers
chickens
they
wouldn
t
turn
an
eye
when
the
wren
told
them
that
a
cat
was
in
the
wood
during
the
time
forbidden
to
cats
to
be
outside
the
houses
of
men
it
is
the
king
of
the
cats
said
the
wren
none
of
the
hawks
lifted
a
wing
they
were
waiting
for
the
chickens
that
would
stray
about
the
moment
after
sunset
but
if
the
wren
couldn
t
rouse
the
she
was
able
to
rouse
the
other
a
cat
a
cat
on
your
lives
a
cat
she
called
out
as
she
flew
through
the
wood
the
rooks
that
were
going
home
now
rose
above
the
trees
cawing
threats
the
blackbirds
thrushes
and
jays
screamed
as
they
flew
before
the
king
of
the
cats
the
woodpeckers
robins
and
linnets
chattered
as
they
flew
behind
him
sometimes
the
young
rooks
made
a
great
show
of
attacking
him
they
flew
down
from
the
flock
he
is
here
here
here
they
cawed
and
flew
up
again
the
rooks
kept
telling
themselves
and
the
other
birds
in
the
wood
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
the
king
of
the
cats
but
a
single
raven
did
more
against
him
than
the
thousand
rooks
that
made
so
much
noise
this
raven
was
in
a
hole
in
the
tree
she
struck
the
king
of
the
cats
on
the
head
with
her
beak
as
he
went
past
the
king
of
the
cats
was
annoyed
by
the
uproar
the
birds
were
making
and
he
was
angered
by
the
raven
s
stroke
but
he
did
not
want
to
enter
into
a
battle
with
the
birds
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
house
of
the
hag
of
the
wood
who
was
then
known
as
the
hag
of
the
ashes
now
as
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
heard
of
the
hag
of
the
ashes
i
ll
have
to
tell
you
how
the
king
of
the
cats
had
heard
of
her
and
how
he
knew
where
her
house
was
in
the
wood
v
the
next
day
the
king
s
son
put
a
bridle
on
the
slight
red
steed
and
rode
towards
the
east
again
he
saw
the
blue
falcon
and
he
followed
where
it
flew
over
benns
and
through
glens
and
across
mountains
and
moors
the
blue
falcon
went
and
the
slight
red
steed
neither
swerved
nor
stumbled
but
went
as
the
bird
flew
the
falcon
lighted
on
a
pine
tree
that
grew
alone
the
king
s
son
rode
up
and
put
his
hands
to
the
tree
to
climb
and
put
his
head
against
it
and
as
he
did
he
heard
speech
from
the
tree
the
stroke
of
the
sword
of
light
will
slay
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
and
the
stroke
of
the
sword
of
light
that
will
cut
a
tress
of
her
hair
will
awaken
there
was
no
more
speech
from
the
tree
and
the
falcon
rose
from
its
branches
and
flew
high
up
in
the
air
then
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rode
back
towards
his
father
s
castle
he
went
to
the
meadow
and
stood
with
art
and
listened
to
what
art
had
to
tell
him
and
as
before
the
king
s
steward
began
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth

told

said
to
the
king
of
the
cats
if
ever
you
need
the
counsel
of
a
human
being
go
to
no
one
else
but
the
hag
of
the
ashes
who
was
once
called
the
hag
of
the
wood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
wood
four
ash
trees
are
drawn
together
at
the
tops
wattles
are
woven
round
these
ash
trees
and
in
the
little
house
made
in
this
way
the
hag
of
the
ashes
lives
with
no
one
near
her
since
her
nine
daughters
went
away
but
her
goat
that
s
her
only
the
king
of
the
cats
was
now
in
the
centre
of
the
wood
he
saw
four
ash
trees
drawn
together
at
the
tops
and
he
jumped
to
them
now
the
hag
of
the
ashes
had
a
bad
neighbor
this
was
a
crane
that
had
built
her
nest
across
the
roof
of
the
little
house
the
nest
prevented
the
smoke
from
coming
out
at
the
top
and
the
house
below
was
filled
with
it
the
hag
could
hardly
keep
alive
on
account
of
the
smoke
and
she
could
neither
take
away
the
nest
nor
banish
the
bird
the
crane
was
there
when
the
king
of
the
cats
sprang
on
the
roof
she
was
sitting
with
her
two
legs
stretched
out
and
when
the
king
of
the
cats
came
down
beside
her
she
slipped
away
and
sailed
over
the
trees
time
for
me
to
be
going
said
the
crane
and
from
that
day
to
this
she
never
came
back
to
the
house
of
the
hag
of
the
ashes
oh

to
you
good
creature
said
the
hag
of
the
ashes
coming
out
of
the
house
tear
down
her
nest
now
and
let
the
smoke
rise
up
through
the
the
king
of
the
cats
tore
up
the
sticks
and
wool
that
the
crane
s
nest
was
made
of
and
the
smoke
came
up
through
the
top
of
the
house

nest

my
floor

of

built
her
nest
on
the
top
of
the
house

vi
the

the
next
day
but
stayed
to
question
those
who
came
to
it
about
the
sword
of
light
and
some
had
heard
of
the
sword
of
light
and
some
had
not
heard
of
it
in
the
afternoon
he
was
in
the
chambers
of
the
castle
and
he
watched
his
two
dermott
and
downal
the
sons
of
caintigern
the
queen
playing
chess
they
played
the
game
upon
his

when

went
up
to
them
and
told

board
and
the
figures
they
said
we
had

saw
that
everything
in
the
castle
was
coming
into
the
possession
of
his
he
found
another
board
with
other
and
he
played
a
game
with
the
king
s
steward
and
art
said
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
cats
into
king
connal
s
dominion
is
a
story
still
to
be
told
to
your
father
s
son
in
all
truth
be
it
told
what
should
a
goat
do
but
ramble
down
laneways
wander
across
fields
stray
along
hedges
and
stay
to
rest
under
shady
trees
all
this
the
hag
s
goat
did
but
at
last
he
brought
the
king
of
the
cats
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
horns
and
what
was
the
hill
of
horns
like
asks
my
kind
it
was
hills
of
stones
on
the
top
of
a
hill
of
stones
only
a
goat
could
foot
it
from
pebble
to
stone
from
stone
to
boulder
from
boulder
ko
crag
and
from
crag
to
it
was
well
and
not
ill
what
the
hag
s
goat
did
but
then
thunder
sounded
lightning
struck
fire
out
of
the
stones
the
wind
mixed
itself
with
the
rain
and
the
tempest
pelted
cat
and
goat
the
goat
stood
on
a
the
wind
rushed
up
from
the
bottom
and
carried
the
companions
to
the
top
of
the
hill
of
horns
down
sprang
the
cat
but
the
goat
stood
on
his
to
butt
back
at
the
wind
the
wind
caught
him
between
the
beard
and
the
and
swept
him
from
the
top
and
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
and
what
happened
to
the
hag
s
goat
after
this
i
never
heard
the
king
of
the
cats
put
his
claws
into
the
crevices
of
a
standing
stone
and
held
to
it
with
great
tenacity
and
then
when
the
wind
abated
and
he
looked
across
his
shoulder
he
found
that
he
was
standing
beside
the
nest
of
the
it
was
a
hollow
edged
with
rocks
and
round
that
hollow
were
scattered
the
horns
of
the
deer
and
goats
that
the
had
carried
off
and
in
the
hollow
there
was
a
calf
and
a
hare
and
a
salmon
the
king
of
the
cats
sprang
into
the
s
nest
first
he
ate
the
salmon
then
he
stretched
himself
between
the
hare
and
the
calf
and
waited
for
the
at
last
he
appeared
down
he
came
to
the
nest
making
circles
in
the
air
he
lighted
on
the
rocky
rim
the
king
of
the
cats
rose
with
body
bent
for
the
spring
and
if
the
was
not
astonished
at
his
appearance
it
was
because
an
eagle
can
never
be
astonished
a
brave
man
would
be
glad
if
he
could
have
seen
the
as
he
crouched
there
on
the
rock
rim
of
his
nest
he
spread
down
his
wings
till
they
were
great
strong
shields
he
bent
down
his
outspread
tail
he
bent
down
his
neck
so
that
his
eyes
might
look
into
the
creature
that
faced
him
and
his
cruel
curved
heavy
beak
was
ready
for
the
stroke
but
the
king
of
the
cats
sprang
into
the
air
the
eagle
lifted
himself
up
but
the
cat
came
down
on
his
broad
back
the
screamed
his
and
flew
off
the
hill
he
struck
at
the
king
of
the
cats
with
the
backs
of
his
broad
wings
then
he
plunged
down
on
the
stones
below
he
would
tear
his
enemy
with
beak
and
claws
it
was
the
cat
that
reached
the
ground
as
the
eagle
went
to
strike
at
him
he
sprang
again
and
tore
the
eagle
s
breast
then
the
caught
the
king
of
the
cats
in
his
claws
and
flew
up
again
screaming
his
drops
of
blood
from
both
fell
on
the
ground
the
eagle
had
not
a
conqueror
s
grip
on
his
enemy
and
the
king
of
the
cats
was
able
to
tear
at
him
it
happened
that
curoi
king
of
the
munster
fairies
was
marching
at
the
head
of
his
troop
to
play
a
game
of
hurling
with
the
fianna
of
ireland
captained
by
fergus
and
for
the
hand
of
aine
the
daughter
of
mananaun
the
lord
of
the
sea
just
when
the
ball
was
about
to
be
thrown
in
the
air
the
and
the
king
of
the
cats
were
seen
mixed
together
in
their
struggle
one
troop
took
the
side
of
the
eagle
and
the
other
took
the
side
of
the
cat
the
men
of
the
country
came
up
and
took
sides
too
then
the
men
began
to
fight
amongst
themselves
and
some
were
left
dead
on
the
ground
and
this
went
on
until
there
were
hosts
of
the
men
of
ireland
fighting
each
other
on
account
of
the
and
the
king
of
the
cats
the
king
of
the
fairies
and
the
chief
of
the
fianna
marched
their
men
away
to
a
hill
top
where
they
might
watch
the
battle
in
the
air
and
the
battles
on
the
ground
if
this
should
go
on
said
curoi
our
troops
will
join
in
and
men
and
fairies
will
be
slaughtered
we
must
end
the
combat
in
the
saying
this
he
took
up
the
and
flung
it
at
the
cat
and
eagle
both
came
down
on
the
ground
the
cat
was
about
to
spring
the
eagle
was
about
to
pounce
when
curoi
darted
between
them
and
struck
both
with
his
spear
eagle
and
cat
became
figures
of
stone
and
there
they
are
now
a
stone
eagle
with
his
wings
outspread
and
a
stone
cat
with
his
teeth
bared
and
his
paws
raised
and
the
and
the
king
of
the
cats
will
remain
like
that
until
curoi
strikes
them
again
with
his
when
the
cat
and
the
eagle
were
turned
into
stone
the
men
of
the
country
wondered
for
a
while
and
then
they
went
away
and
the
fairies
of
munster
and
the
fianna
of
ireland
played
the
hurling
match
for
the
hand
of
aine
the
daughter
of
mananaun
who
is
lord
of
the
sea
and
what
the
result
of
that
hurling
match
was
is
told
in
another
book
and
that
ends
my
history
of
the
coming
into
of
the
king
of
the
cats
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
left
art
and
went
into
an
unused
room
in
the
castle
to
search
for
a
little
bell
that
he
might
put
upon
the
slight
red
steed
he
found
the
little
bell
but
it
fell
out
of
his
hand
and
slipped
through
a
crack
in
the
floor
he
went
and
looked
through
the
crack
he
saw
below
a
room
and
in
it
was
caintigern
the
queen
and
beside
her
were
two
women
in
the
cloaks
of
enchantresses
and
when
he
looked
again

knew
the
two
of
them

were
aefa

of
the
enchanter
of
the

found
the
builder
and
shaper
for
the

in
a
certain
place
he
came
to
where
the
gobaun
saor
had
set
up
his
forge
and
planted
his
anvil
and
he
saw
the
gobaun
saor
beating
on
a
shape
of
iron
you

to
find
the
sword
of

said
the
gobaun
his
eyes
as
straight
as
the
line
of
a
but

first
your
will
your
mind
and

said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
guard
my
anvil
for
a
few
nights
said
the
gobaun
saor
a
fua
comes
out
of
the
river
sometimes
and
tries
to
carry
it
the
gobaun
saor
had
to
make
a
journey
to
look
at
trees
that
were
growing
in
the
forest
and
the
king
s
son
guarded
his
anvil
and
at
night
a
fua
came
out
of
the
river
and
flung
great
stones
striving
to
drive
him
away
from
the
anvil
he
ran
down
to
the
river
bank
to
drive
it
away
but
the
creature
caught
him
in
its
long
arms
and
tried
to
drown
him
in
the
deep
water
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
near
his
death
but
he
broke
away
from
the
fua
and
when
the
creature
caught
him
again
he
dragged
it
up
the
bank
and
held
it
against
a
tree
i
will
give
you
the
mastery
of
all
arts
because
you
have
mastered
me
said
the
fua
i
do
not
want
the
mastery
of
arts
but
maybe
you
can
tell
me
where
to
find
the
sword
of
you
want
to
know
that
do
you
said
the
fua
and
then
it
twisted
from
him
and
went
into
the
river
the
fua
came
the
next
night
and
flung
stones
as
before
and
the
king
s
son
wrestled
with
it
in
the
very
middle
of
the
river
and
held
him
so
that
he
could
not
get
to
the
other
bank
i
will
give
you
heaps
of
wealth
because
you
have
mastered
me
said
the
creature
with
the
big
eyes
and
the
long
arms
not
wealth
but
the
knowledge
of
where
to
come
on
the
sword
of
light
is
what
i
want
from
you
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
but
the
fua
twisted
from
him
and
ran
away
again
the
next
night
the
fua
came
again
and
the
king
s
son
wrestled
with
him
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
followed
him
up
the
other
bank
and
held
him
against
a
tree
i
will
give
you
the
craft
that
will
make
you
the
greatest
of
kings
because
you
have
mastered
not
craft
but
knowledge
of
where
the
sword
of
light
is
i
want
from
you
said
the
king
s
son
only
one
of
the
people
of
light
can
tell
you
that
said
the
fua
it
became
a
small
empty
sort
of
creature
and
lay
on
the
ground
like
a
shadow
the
gobaun
saor
came
back
to
his
forge
and
his
anvil
you
have
guarded
my
anvil
for
me
he
said
and
i
will
tell
you
where
to
go
for
the
sword
of
light
it
is
in
the
palace
of
the
ancient
ones
under
the
lake
you
have
an
enchanted
steed
that
can
go
to
that
lake
i
shall
turn
his
head
and
he
shall
go
straight
to
it
when
you
come
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
pull
the
branches
of
the
fountain
tree
and
give
the
slight
red
steed
the
leaves
to
eat
mount
now
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
mounted
the
slight
red
steed
and
went
traveling
again
ii
from
all
its
branches
high
and
low
water
was
falling
in
little
streams
this
was
the
fountain
tree
indeed
he
did
not
dismount
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
but
pulled
the
branches
and
he
gave
them
to
the
slight
red
steed
to
eat
he
ate
no
more
than
three
mouthfuls
then
he
stamped
on
the
ground
with
his
hooves
lifted
his
head
high
and
neighed
three
times
with
that
he
plunged
into
the
water
of
the
lake
and
swam
and
swam
as
if
he
had
the
strength
of
a
dragon
he
swam
while
there
was
light
on
the
water
and
he
swam
while
there
was
night
on
the
water
and
when
the
sun
of
the
next
day
was
a
hand
s
breadth
above
the
lake
he
came
to
the
black
island
all
on
that
island
was
black
and
burnt
and
there
were
black
ashes
up
to
the
horse
s
knees
and
no
sooner
had
the
slight
red
steed
put
his
hooves
on
the
island
than
he
galloped
straight
to
the
middle
of
it
he
galloped
through
an
opening
in
the
black
rock
and
went
through
a
hundred
passages
each
going
lower
than
the
other
and
at
last
he
came
into
the
wide
space
of
a
hall
the
hall
was
lighted
when
the
king
s
son
looked
to
see
where
the
light
came
from
he
saw
a
sword
hanging
from
the
roof
and
the
brightness
of
the
sword
was
such
that
the
hall
was
well
lighted
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
galloped
the
slight
red
steed
forward
and
made
it
rear
up
his
hand
grasped
the
hilt
of
the
sword
as
he
pulled
it
down
the
sword
screeched
in
his
hand
he
flashed
it
about
and
saw
what
other
things
were
in
the
cave
he
saw
one
woman
and
two
women
and
three
women
he
came
to
them
and
he
saw
they
were
sleeping
and
as
he
flashed
the
sword
about
he
saw
other
women
sleeping
too
there
were
twelve
women
in
the
cave
where
the
sword
of
light
had
been
hanging
and
the
women
were
sleeping
and
in
the
hands
of
each
of
the
sleeping
women
was
a
great
gemmed
cup
the
spirit
of
the
king
s
son
had
grown
haughty
since
he
felt
the
sword
in
his
hands
you
have
the
sword
why
should
you
not
have
the
cup
something
within
him
said
he
took
a
cup
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
sleeping
women
and
drank
the
bubbling
water
that
it
held
his
spirit
grew
more
haughty
with
that
draught
from
the
hands
of
each
of
the
twelve
sleeping
women
he
took
the
cup
and
he
drank
the
draught
of
bubbling
water
that
it
held
and
when
he
had
drunk
the
twelve
draughts
of
bubbling
water
he
felt
that
with
the
sword
of
light
in
his
hands
he
could
cut
his
way
through
the
earth
he
mounted
the
slight
red
steed
and
rode
it
through
the
cave
and
swam
it
across
the
lake
with
no
name
he
held
the
sword
of
light
across
his
saddle
the
steed
went
as
the
current
drew
him
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
eaten
the
leaves
of
the
fountain
tree
and
the
spirit
that
had
made
him
vigorous
coming
was
feeble
now
the
current
brought
them
to
the
shore
below
where
the
fountain
tree
grew
and
there
on
the
shore
he
saw
a
bunch
of
little
men
little
women
and
littler
children
all
with
skins
all
with
but
one
eye
in
their
heads
all
crying
and
screaming
at
each
other
like
and
all
sitting
round
a
fire
of
dried
water
weeds
cooking
and
eating
eels
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
put
his
hands
on
the
and
drew
the
slight
red
steed
out
of
the
water
the
women
with
one
right
eye
and
the
men
with
one
left
eye
and
the
children
in
their
bare
smoky
skins
screamed
at
him
what
do
you
want
what
do
you
want
man
with
the
horse
feed
and
water
my
steed
for
me
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
we
are
the
swallow
people
and
no
one
commands
us
to
do
things
said
an
old
fellow
with
a
beard
like
knots
of
ropes
feed
my
steed
with
red
wheat
and
water
it
with
pure
spring
water
said
the
king
s
son
fiercely
i
am
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
the
sword
of
light
is
in
my
hands
and
what
i
command
must
be
we
are
the
swallow
people
and
we
are
accounted
a
harmless
people
said
the
old
fellow
why
are
ye
harmless
said
the
king
s
son
and
he
flourished
the
sword
at
them
come
into
our
cave
king
s
son
said
the
old
fellow
we
will
give
you
refreshment
there
and
the
children
will
attend
to
your
he
went
into
the
cave
with
certain
of
the
swallow
people
they
were
all
unmannerly
they
kept
screaming
and
crying
to
each
other
they
pulled
at
the
clothes
of
the
king
s
son
and
pinched
him
one
of
them
bit
his
hands
when
they
came
into
the
cave
they
all
sat
down
on
black
stones
one
pulled
in
a
black
ass
loaded
with
nets
they
took
the
nets
off
its
back
and
before
the
king
s
son
knew
that
anything
was
about
to
happen
they
threw
the
nets
around
him
the
meshes
of
the
nets
were
sticky
he
felt
himself
caught
he
ran
at
the
swallow
people
and
fell
over
a
stone
then
they
drew
more
nets
around
his
legs
the
old
fellow
whom
he
had
commanded
took
up
the
sword
of
light
then
the
swallow
people
pulled
up
the
ass
that
had
carried
the
nets
and
rubbed
its
hard
hoof
on
the
sword
the
king
s
son
did
not
know
what
happened
to
it
then
he
heard
them
cry
the
brightness
is
gone
off
the
thing
they
left
the
sword
on
a
black
rock
and
now
no
light
came
from
it
then
all
the
swallow
people
scrambled
out
of
the
cave
they
came
back
eating
eels
and
out
of
their
hands
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
but
climbed
into
a
cave
above
where
he
was
lying
he
broke
the
nets
that
were
round
him
he
found
the
sword
on
the
black
stones
with
the
brightness
all
gone
from
it
because
of
the
rubbing
with
the
ass
s
hoof
he
climbed
up
the
wall
of
the
other
cave
to
punish
the
swallow
people
they
saw
him
before
he
could
see
them
in
the
darkness
and
they
all
went
into
holes
and
hid
themselves
as
if
they
were
rats
and
mice
with
the
blackened
sword
in
his
hands
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
out
of
the
cave
and
the
horse
he
had
left
behind
the
slight
red
steed
was
not
to
be
found
iii
without
a
steed
and
with
a
blackened
sword
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
came
to
where
the
gobaun
saor
had
set
up
his
forge
and
planted
his
anvil
no
water
nor
sand
would
clean
the
sword
but
he
left
it
down
before
the
gobaun
saor
hoping
that
he
would
show
him
a
way
to
dean
it
the
sword
must

the
king
of

and
day
long
days
and
short
days
the
only
garment
he
ever
put
on
was
a
goatskin
a
hunter
had
once
put
it
down
on
the

ways
of
diverting
himself
he
used
to
shoot
arrows
with
a
bow
out
of
the
door
of
the
house
and
hit
a
mark
on
a
tree
that
was
opposite
him
where
did
he
get
the
bow
and
arrows
the
bow
fell
down
from
the
roof
of
the
house
and
into

cradle
and
as
for
arrows
he
used
to
make
them
out
of
the
wands
that
the
hags
brought
in
to
make
baskets
with
but
the
hags
never
saw
him
using
the
bow
and
sending
off
the
arrows
all
day
they
would
be
going
along
the
streams
gathering
the
willow
wands
for
the
baskets
they
made
he
knew
nobody
except
the
three
hags
of
the
long
teeth
and
he
had
never
heard
the
name
of
mother
or
father
often
when
she
was
peeling
the
wands
with
a
knife
the
hag
of
the
house
used
to
tell
gilly
of
the

the
troubles
that

for
him
danger
from
the
sword
and
the
spear
and
the

earth
and
the
birds
of
the
air
she
delighted
to
tell
him
about
the
evils
that
would
befall
him
and
she
used
to
laugh
when
she
told
him
he
was
a
and
that
people
would
throw
stones
at
him
one
day
when
the
hags
were
away
gathering
willow
wands
gilly
turned
the
cradle
over
and
lay
under
it
he
wanted
to
see
what
they
would
do
when
they
did
not
see
him
sitting
up
in
the
cradle
they
came
in
gilly
looked
through
a
crack
in
the
cradle
and
saw
the
hags
they
were
old
and
crooked
and
had
long
teeth
that
came
down
below
their
chins
he
s
gone
he

screamed
the
hag
of
the
house
when

one
of
the
hags

long
teeth

son

he
said
the
hag
of
the
house
with
great
anger
he
ll
never
become
a
champion
he
s
only
a
little
fellow
with
no
weapons
and
with
no
garment
but
a
it
would
be
better
to
kill
him
when
he
comes
back
said
the
first
of
the
hags
with
the
long
teeth
and
if
he
doesn
t
come
back
tell
the
giant
crom
duv
said
the
second
gilly
of
the
goatskin
crept
from
under
the
cradle
put
his
bow
resting
on
the
bottom
that
was
now
turned
uppermost
took
up
some
of
the
rods
that
were
on
the
floor
and
then
shouted
at
the
hags
oh
if
that
s
a
hazel
rod
he
has
at
his
bow
he
will
kill
us
all
they
screamed
out
together
he
drew
back
the
string
fired
the
willow
rod
and
struck
the
middle
hag
full
on
the
breast
the
three
hags
fell
down
on
the
ground
the
pot
that
was
always
hanging
over
the
fire
turned
itself
upside
down
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
gilly
of
the
goatskin
the
bow
in
his
hand
sprang
across
the
cradle
over
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
out
into
the
width
and
the
height
the
length
and
the
breadth
the
gloom
and
the
gleam
of
the
world
vii
he
was
out
as
i
have
said
in
the
width
and
the
height
the
length
and
the
breadth
the
gloom
and
the
gleam
of
the
world
he
fired
arrows
into
the
air
he
leaped
over
ditches
he
rolled
down
hillsides
he
raced
over
level
places
until
he
came
to
what
surprised
him
more
than
all
the
things
in
the
world
a
river
he
had
never
seen
such
water
before
and
he
wondered
to
see
it
moving
with
swiftness
where
is
it
going
said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
does
it
go
on
like
that
in
the
night
as
well
as
in
the
day
he
ran
by
its
side
and
shouted
to
the
river
he
saw
a
bird
flying
across
it
it
was
the
bird
that
we
call
the
crane
or
the
heron
and
as
gilly
watched
the
great
winged
thing
he
saw
that
it
held
a
little
animal
in
its
claws
gilly
fired
an
arrow
and
the
crane
dropped
towards
the
ground
the
little
animal
that
was
in
its
claws
fell
down
the
crane
rose
up
again
and
flew
back
across
the
river
the
little
animal
that
had
been
in
the
claws
of
the
crane
came
to
gilly
of
the
goatskin

was
smaller
than
the

to
sit
on
the
hearth
of

at
carrying
the
weasel
went
into
the
water
and
put
his
mouth
to
the
egg
and
tried
to
lift
it
he
could
not
move
it
he
tried
to
lift
it
with
his
paws
as
well
as
with
his
mouth
but
this
did
not
do
either
he
came
up
the
bank
then
and
said
to
gilly
you
ll
think
i
m
a
poor
sort
of
a
servant
because
i
can
t
take
an
egg
out
of
the
water
but
if
i
can
t
win
one
way
i
ll
win
another
he
went
into
the
reeds
by
the
river
and
he
said
hear
me
frogs
there
s
a
great
army
coming
to
take
you
out
of
the
reeds
and
eat
you
red
and
then
gilly
saw
the
queer
frogs
lifting
up
their
heads
oh
what
will
we
do
what
will
we
do
they
cried
to
the
weasel
there
s
only
one
thing
to
be
done
said
the
weasel
you
gather
up
all
the
pebbles
in
the
bed
of
the
fiver
and
we
ll
make
a
big
wail
on
the
bank
to
defend
the
frogs
dived
into
the
water
at
once
and
dragged
up
pebbles
gilly
and
the
weasel
piled
them
on
the
bank
then
three
frogs
carried
up
the
crystal
egg
the
weasel
took
it
from
them
when
they
left
it
on
the
bank
then
he
climbed
a
tree
and
cried
out
to
the
frogs
the
army
is
frightened
and
is
running
oh
thank
you
thank
you
said
the
frogs
we
ll
never
forget
your
goodness
to
then
they
sat
down
in
the
marsh
and
told
each
other
what
a
narrow
escape
they
all
had
the
weasel
gave
gilly
the
crystal
egg
it
was
heavy
and
he
carried
it
for
a
while
in
his
hand
they
went
on
after
a
while
said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
the
night
s
coming
on
and
the
fiver
shows
no
sign
of
turning
back
i
wish
there
was
a
nice
place
to
shelter
no
sooner
did
he
say
the
word
than
he
and
the
weasel
found
standing
before
the
open
door
of
a
nice
little
house
they
went
in
a
clear
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
an
arm
chair
was
before
it
and
a
bed
was
made
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
this
is
good
said
gilly
and
now
i
wish
that
we
had
something
to
no
sooner
did
he
say
the
words
than
a
table
appeared
with
bread
and
meat
fruit
and
wine
on
it
where
do
these
fine
things
come
from
i
wonder
said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
it
s
my
belief
said
the
weasel
that
all
these
things
come
to
us
on
account
of
the
egg
you
have
in
your
hand
it
s
a
magic
gilly
of
the
goatskin
put
the
egg
on
the
table
and
wished
that
he
might
see
himself
as
he
had
seen
himself
in
the
river
nothing
appeared
then
he
took
the
egg
in
his
hand
and
wished
again
and
then
there
was
a
looking
glass
on
the
wall
before
him
and
he
saw
himself
in
it
better
than
he
had
seen
himself
in
the
river
gilly
of
the
goatskin
knew
that
he
had
only
to
hold
the
crystal
egg
in
his
hand
and
wish
to
get
all
he
could
think
of
viii
gilly
of
the
goatskin
wished
for
wide
windows
in
his
house
and
he
got
them
he
wished
for
a
light
within
when
there
was
darkness
without
and
he
got
a
silver
lamp
that
burned
until
he
wished
to
sleep
he
wished
for
the
songs
of
birds
and
he
had
a
blackbird
singing
upon
his
a
lark
over
his
chimney
a
goldfinch
and
a
green
linnet
within
his
window
and
a
shy
wren
in
the
evening
singing
from
the
top
of
his
dresser
then
he
wished
to
hear
the
conversation
of
the
beasts
and
all
the
creatures
of
the
fields
and
the
wood
and
the
mountain
top
came
into
his
house
the
hare
used
to
come
in
early
in
the
morning
he
was
always
the
first
visitor
and
he
never
remained
long
and
always
while
he
was
there
he
kept
running
up
and
down
the
house
and
he
generally
ended
his
visit
by
jumping
through
the
open
window
the
martens
the
beautiful
wild
cats
of
the
wood
came
in
to
see
gilly
once
they
were
very
proud
and
told
him
nothing
the
little
black
rabbits
were
very
much
impressed
by
the
martens
and
all
the
time
the
martens
were
there
they
stayed
under
the
bed
and
the
chairs
two
or
three
times
the
king
of
the
wood
himself
the
boar
of
the
bristles
and
the
long
tusks
came
to
see
gilly
he
used
to
push
open
the
door
and
then
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
grunting
and
grunting
once
he
brought
his
wife
with
him
and
six
or
seven
of
their
little
pigs
that
went
running
over
the
floor
with
their
ears
hanging
over
their
eyes
came
with
them
too
the
hedgehogs
used
to
come
but
they
always
made
themselves
disagreeable
they
just
lay
down
by
the
fire
and
snored
and
when
they
wakened
up
they
quarrelled
with
each
other
everybody
said
that
the
hedgehogs
children
were
very
badly
brought
up
and
very
badly
provided
for
the
squirrels
who
were
so
clean
and
careful
and
so
fond
of
their
children
thought
the
hedgehogs
were
very
bad
creatures
indeed
it
is
just
like
them
to
have
dirty
sticky
thorns
around
them
instead
of
nice
clean
fur
said
the
squirrel
s
wife
but
my
dear
said
the
squirrel
every
animal
can
t
have
how
well
said
she
the
rabbits
have
fur
though
dear
knows
they
re
creatures
of
not
much
account
it
s
all
just
to
let
us
see
that
they
re
some
relation
of
that
horrible
horrible
boar
that
goes
crashing
and
marching
through
the
the
deer
never
came
into
the
house
and
gilly
had
a
shed
made
for
them
outside
they
would
come
into
it
and
stay
there
for
many
nights
and
days
and
gilly
used
to
go
out
and
talk
with
them
they
knew
about
far
countries
and
strange
paths
and
passes
but
they
did
not
know
so
much
about
men
and
about
the
doings
of
other
creatures
as
the
fox
did
the
fox
used
to
come
in
the
evening
and
stay
until
nearly
morning
whether
gilly
fell
asleep
or
kept
awake
the
fox
was
a
very
good
talker
he
used
to
lie
down
at
the
hearth
with
his
paws
stretched
out
and
tell
about
this
one
and
that
one
and
what
she
said
and
what
he
did
if
the
fox
came
to
see
you
and
if
he
was
in
good
humor
for
talking
you
would
stay
up
all
night
to
listen
to
him
i
know
i
should
it
was
the
fox
who
told
gilly
what
the
crow
of
achill
did
to
laheen
the
eagle
she
had
stolen
the
crystal
egg
that
laheen
was
about
to
hatch
the
crystal
egg
that
the
crane
had
left
on
a
bare
rock
it
was
the
fox
who
told
gilly
how
the
first
cat
came
into
the
world
and
it
was
the
fox
who
told
gilly
about
the
generations
of
the
eel
all
i
say
is
that
it
is
a
pity
the
fox
can
not
be
trusted
for
a
better
one
to
talk
and
tell
a
story
it
would
be
hard
to
find
he
was
always
picking
up
and
eating
things
that
had
been
left
over
a
potato
roasting
in
the
ashes
an
apple
left
upon
a
plate
a
piece
of
meat
under
a
cover
gilly
did
not
grudge
these
things
to
rory
the
fox
and
he
always
left
something
in
a
bag
for
him
to
take
home
to
the
young
foxes
i
had
nearly
forgotten
to
tell
you
about
gilly
s
friend
the
brave
weasel
he
had
made
a
home
for
himself
under
the
roof
sometimes
he
would
go
away
for
a
day
or
so
and
he
would
never
tell
gilly
where
he
had
been
when
he
was
at
home
he
made
himself
the
of
gilly
s
house
if
any
of
the
creatures
made
themselves
disagreeable
by
quarrelling
amongst
each
other
or
by
being
uncivil
to
gilly
the
weasel
would
just
walk
over
to
them
and
look
them
in
the
eyes
then
that
creature
went
away
always
he
held
his
head
up
and
if
gilly
asked
him
for
advice
he
would
say
three
words
have
no
fear
have
no
one
day
gilly
wanted
to
have
a
bunch
of
cherries
with
his
dinner
and
he
went
to
find
the
crystal
egg
so
that
he
might
wish
for
it
the
crystal
egg
was
not
in
the
place
he
had
left
it
he
called
the
weasel
and
the
two
of
them
searched
the
house
the
crystal
egg
was
nowhere
to
be
found
one
of
the
creatures
has
stolen
the
egg
said
the
weasel
but
whoever
stole
it
i
will
make
bring
it
back
i
ll
soon
find
out
who
did
the
weasel
walked
up
to
every
creature
that
came
in
looked
him
or
her
in
the
eye
and
said
did
you
steal
the
crystal
egg
and
every
creature
that
came
in
said
no
little
lion
i
didn
t
steal
next
day
they
had
examined
every
creature
except
the
fox
the
fox
had
not
been
in
the
night
before
nor
the
night
before
that
again
he
did
not
come
in
the
evening
they
missed
the
crystal
egg
nor
the
evening
after
that
evening
that
night
the
weasel
said
as
sure
as
there
are
teeth
in
my
head
the
fox
stole
the
crystal
egg
as
soon
as
there
is
light
we
ll
search
for
him
and
make
him
give
the
egg
back
to
ix
the
weasel
was
right
it
was
rory
the
fox
who
had
stolen
gilly
s
crystal
egg
one
night
just
as
he
was
leaving
gilly
s
house
the
moon
shone
full
upon
the
crystal
egg
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
rory
the
fox
had
made
a
little
spring
and
had
taken
the
egg
in
his
mouth
then
he
slipped
out
by
the
door
as
quick
and
as
quiet
as
a
leaf
blown
in
the
wind
he
couldn
t
help
himself
stealing
the
egg
when
the
chance
came
he
had
had
a
dream
about
it
he
dreamt
that
the
egg
had
been
hatched
and
that
out
of
it
had
come
the
most
toothsome
bird
that
a
fox
had
ever
taken
by
the
neck
he
snapped
his
teeth
in
his
sleep
when
he
dreamt
of
it
the
fox
told
his
youngsters
about
the
bird
he
had
dreamt
of
a
bird
as
big
as
a
goose
and
so
fat
on
the
neck
and
the
breast
that
it
could
hardly
stir
from
sitting
the
youngsters
had
smacked
their
lips
and
snapped
their
teeth
every
time
he
came
home
now
they
used
to
say
to
him
father
have
you
brought
us
the
boobrie
bird
no
wonder
that
his
eyes
used
to
turn
to
the
crystal
egg
when
he
sat
in
gilly
s
house
and
then
because
the
moon
shone
on
it
just
as
he
was
leaving
and
because
he
knew
that
gilly
s
back
was
turned
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
making
a
little
spring
and
taking
the
crystal
egg
softly
in
his
mouth
he
went
amongst
the
dark
dark
trees
with
the
soft
and
easy
trot
of
a
fox
he
knew
well
what
he
should
do
with
the
egg
he
had
dreamt
that
it
had
been
hatched
by
the
s
old
rheumatic
goose
this
goose
was
called
old
mother
hatchie
and
the
fox
had
never
carried
her
off
because
he
knew
she
was
always
hatching
out
goslings
for
his
table
he
went
through
the
trees
and
across
the
fields
towards
the
s
house
the
lived
by
telling
people
their
fortunes
and
reading
them
their
dreams
that
is
why
she
was
called
the
the
people
gave
her
goods
for
telling
them
their
dreams
and
fortunes
and
she
left
her
land
and
stock
to
whatever
chanced
the
fences
of
her
fields
were
broken
and
rotted
her
hens
had
been
carried
off
by
the
fox
her
goat
had
gone
wild
she
had
neither
ox
nor
ass
nor
sheep
nor
pig
the
fox
went
through
her
fence
now
as
lightning
would
go
through
a
gooseberry
bush
and
he
came
out
before
her
barn
there
was
a
hole
in
the
and
he
went
through
that
and
in
the
corner
of
the
barn
he
saw
old
mother
hatchie
sitting
on
a
nest
of
straw
and
he
knew
that
there
was
a
clutch
of
eggs
under
her
she
cackled
when
she
saw
the
fox
on
the
floor
of
the
barn
but
she
never
stirred
off
the
nest
rory
left
what
was
in
his
mouth
on
the
ground
old
mother
hatchie
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
the
egg
that
was
clear
in
the
full
moonlight
this
egg
mistress
hatchie
said
rory
the
fox
is
from
the
of
the
queen
of
ireland
the
queen
asked
the
to
ask
me
to
leave
it
with
you
she
thinks
there
s
no
bird
in
the
world
but
yourself
that
is
worthy
to
hatch
it
and
to
rear
the
gosling
that
comes
out
of
that
s
right
that
s
right
said
mother
hatchie
put
it
here
put
it
she
lifted
her
wing
and
the
fox
put
the
crystal
egg
into
the
he
went
out
of
the
barn
crossed
the
field
again
and
went
amongst
the
dark
dark
trees
he
went
along
slowly
now
for
he
began
to
think
that
gilly
might
find
out
who
stole
the
crystal
egg
and
be
vexed
with
him
then
he
thought
of
the
weasel
the
fox
began
to
think
he
might
be
sorry
for
himself
if
the
weasel
was
set
on
his
track
rory
did
not
go
to
gilly
s
house
the
next
night
nor
the
night
after
the
third
night
as
he
was
going
home
from
a
ramble
the
owl
hooted
at
him
why
do
you
hoot
at
me
big
moth
said
the
fox
stopping
in
his
trot
he
always
called
the
owl
big
moth
to
pretend
that
he
thought
she
wasn
t
a
bird
at
all
but
a
moth
he
made
this
pretence
because
he
was
annoyed
that
he
could
never
get
an
owl
to
eat
why
do
you
hoot
at
me
big
moth
said
he
the
weasel
s
going
to
have
your
bones
for
his
and
your
blood
for
his
morning
dram
said
the
owl
balefully
as
she
went
amongst
the
dark
dark
trees
the
fox
stopped
long
to
consider
then
he
went
to
his
burrow
and
told
his
youngsters
they
would
have
to
move
house
he
had
them
stirring
at
the
first
light
he
gave
them
a
frog
each
for
their
breakfast
and
took
them
across
the
country
they
came
to
a
burrow
that
badger
had
just
left
and
rory
the
fox
brought
his
youngsters
into
it
and
told
them
that
it
would
be
their
new
house
x
the
evening
after
when
rory
the
fox
was
taking
his
nap
he
heard
one
of
his
youngsters
give
a
sharp
cry
they
were
playing
outside
the
burrow
lie
looked
out
and
he
saw
that
his
three
youngsters
were
afraid
of
something
that
was
between
them
and
the
burrow
he
looked
again
and
saw
the
weasel
ahem
said
rory
the
fox
and
how
are
we
this
morning
the
weasel
had
marked
one
of
rory
s
youngsters
for
attack
although
rory
spoke
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
youngster
he
had
marked
my
dear
friend
said
the
fox
i
was
just
going
to
say
if
you
are
looking
for
anything
perhaps
i
could
tell
you
where
it
might
be
crystal
egg
said
the
weasel
without
ever
taking
away
his
gaze
from
rory
s
youngster
oh
the
crystal
egg
said
rory
the
fox
yes
to
be
sure
i
could
bring
you
at
once
to
the
place
where
the
crystal
egg
he
came
out
of
the
burrow
and
saw
gilly
standing
on
the
bank
behind
i
think
it
is
time
for
my
children
to
go
back
to
their
burrow
said
rory
the
fox
please
excuse
them
my
the
weasel
took
his

the
clear
day
going
and

said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
eat
as
you
like
said
the
old
woman
of
beare
she
pushed
him
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
bottle
of
water
when
he
cut
a
slice
of
the
loaf
it
was
just
as
if
nothing
had
been
cut
off
and
when
he
took
a
cupful
out
of
the
bottle
it
was
as
if
no
water
had
been
taken
out
of
it
at
all
when
he
had
drunk
and
eaten
he
left
the
complete
loaf
and
the
full
bottle
of
water
on
the
shelf
went
outside
and
began
to
count
the
horns
on
the
side
on
the
second
day
a
strange
youth
came
to
him
and
saluted
him
and
then
went
to
count
the
horns
in
the
quarry
on
the
side
this
youth
was
none
other
than
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
on
the
third
day
they
had
the
horns
all
counted
then
gilly
of
the
goatskin
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
met
together
under
a
bush
how
many
horns
have
you
counted
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
so
many
said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
and
how
many
horns
have
you
counted
so
many
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
just
as
they
were
adding
the
two
numbers
together
they
both
heard
sounds
in
the
air
they
were
like
the
sounds
that
bards
make
chanting
their
verses
and
when
they
looked
up
they
saw
a
swan
flying
round
and
round
above
them
and
the
swan
chanted
the
story
of
the
coming
of
the
milesians
to
eirinn
and
as
the
two
youths
listened
they
forgot
the
number
of
horns
they
had
counted
and
when
the
swan
had
flown
away
they
looked
at
each
other
and
as
they
were
hungry
they
went
into
the
house
and
ate
slices
of
the
unwasted
loaf
and
drank
cupfuls
out
of
the
inexhaustible
bottle
then
the
old
woman
of
beare
wakened
up
and
asked
them
to
tell
her
the
number
of
her
years
we
can
not
tell
you
although
we
counted
all
the
horns
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
for
just
as
we
were
putting
the
numbers
together
a
swan
sang
to
us
and
we
forgot
the
number
we
had
you
didn
t
do
your
task
rightly
she
said
but
as
i
promised
to
give
this
youth
a
name
and
to
listen
to
the
story
he
had
to
tell
i
shall
have
to
let
it
be
you
may
tell
the
story
now
gilly
of
the
they
sat
at
the
fire
and
while
the
old
woman
of
beare
spun
threads
on
a
very
ancient
spindle
and
while
the
corncrake
the
cuckoo
and
the
swallow
picked
up
grains
and
murmured
to
themselves
gilly
of
the
goatskin
told
them
the
unique
tale
and
the
story
as
gilly
of
the
goatskin
told
it
follows
a
unique
tale
a
king
and
a
queen
were
walking
one
day
by
the
blue
pool
in
their
domain
the
swan
had
come
to
the
blue
pool
and
the
bright
yellow
flowers
of
the
broom
were
above
the
water
och
said
the
queen
if
i
might
have
a
daughter
that
would
show
such
colors
the
blue
of
the
pool
in
her
eyes
the
bright
yellow
of
the
broom
in
her
hair
and
the
white
of
the
swan
in
her
skin
i
would
let
my
seven
sons
go
with
the
wild
hush
said
the
king
you
ask
for
a
doom
and
it
may
be
sent
a
shivering
came
upon
the
queen
they
went
back
to
the
castle
and
that
evening
the
nurse
told
them
that
a
gray
man
had
passed
in
a
circle
round
her
seven
sons
saying
if
it
be
as
your
mother
desired
let
it
be
as
she
has
well
before
the
broom
blossomed
again
and
before
the
swan
came
to
the
blue
pool
a
child
was
born
to
the
queen
it
was
a
girl
the
king
was
sitting
with
his
seven
sons
when
the
women
came
to
tell
him
of
the
new
birth
o
my
sons
said
he
may
ye
be
with
me
all
my
but
his
sons
moved
from
him
as
he
said
it
out
through
the
door
they
went
and
up
the
mound
that
was
before
the
door
there
they
changed
into
gray
wild
geese
and
the
seven
flew
towards
the
empty
hills
no
councillor
that
the
king
consulted
could
help
to
win
them
back
again
and
no
hunter
that
he
sent
through
the
country
could
gain
tale
or
tidings
of
them
the
king
and
queen
were
left
with
one
child
only
the
girl
just
born
they
called
her
sheen
a
word
that
means
storm
because
her
coming
was
a
storm
that
swept
away
her
seven
brothers
the
queen
died
my
hearers
then
little
sheen
was
forgotten
by
her
father
and
she
was
reared
and
companioned
by
the
servants
of
the
house
one
day
when
she
was
the
age
her
eldest
brother
was
when
he
was
changed
from
his
human
form
sheen
went
with
mor
the
woodman
s
daughter
and
siav
the
s
to
gather
berries
in
the
wood
going
here
and
there
she
got
separated
from
siav
and
mor
she
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
lots
of
berries
and
went
step
after
step
to
pick
them
her
feet
went
down
in
a
marsh
she
cried
to
mor
and
siav
but
no
answers
came
from
them
she
cried
and
cried
again
her
cries
startled
seven
wild
geese
that
rose
up
and
flew
round
her
save
me
she
cried
to
them
then
one
of
the
wild
geese
spoke
to
her
anyone
but
a
girl
we
would
save
from
the
marsh
but
such
a
one
we
can
not
save
because
it
was
a
girl
who
lost
us
our
human
forms
and
the
loving
companionship
of
our
then
sheen
knew
for
the
servants
had
often
told
her
the
story
that
it
was
one
of
her
seven
brothers
who
spoke
since
ever
i
knew
of
it
said
she
the
whole
of
my
trouble
has
been
that
i
was
the
cause
of
your
losing
your
human
form
and
the
companionship
of
our
father
who
is
now
called
the
lonely
king
believe
me
said
she
that
i
would
have
striven
and
striven
to
win
you
there
was
so
much
feeling
in
her
voice
that
her
seven
brothers
although
they
had
been
hardened
by
thinking
about
their
misfortune
were
touched
at
their
hearts
and
they
flew
down
to
help
her
they
bore
up
her
arms
they
caught
at
her
shoulders
they
raised
up
her
feet
they
carried
her
beyond
the
marsh
then
she
knelt
down
and
cried
to
them
o
my
brothers
dear
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
restore
you
to
your
human
forms
there
is
said
the
first
of
the
seven
wild
geese
she
begged
them
to
tell
it
to
her
it
s
a
long
and
a
tiresome
labor
we
would
put
on
you
said
one
if
you
would
gather
the
light
down
that
grows
on
the
bogs
with
your
own
hands
said
another
and
if
you
spun
that
down
into
threads
and
wove
the
threads
into
a
cloth
and
sewed
the
cloth
into
a
shirt
and
did
that
over
and
over
again
until
you
had
made
seven
shirts
for
us
all
that
time
without
laughing
or
crying
or
saying
a
word
you
could
save
us
one
shirt
you
could
weave
and
spin
and
sew
in
a
year
and
it
would
not
be
until
the
seven
shirts
were
put
upon
us
that
the
human
form
would
be
restored
to
each
of
i
would
be
glad
to
do
all
that
said
sheen
and
i
would
cry
no
tear
laugh
no
laugh
and
say
no
word
all
the
time
i
was
doing
this
then
said
the
eldest
brother
the
marsh
is
between
you
and
our
father
s
house
and
between
you
and
the
companions
who
were
with
you
if
you
would
do
the
task
that
would
restore
us
to
our
human
forms
it
were
best
you
did
not
go
back
beyond
the
trees
is
the
house
of
a
lone
woman
and
there
you
may
live
until
your
task
is
the
seven
wild
geese
then
flew
back
to
the
marsh
and
sheen
went
to
the
house
beyond
the
trees
the
lived
there
she
took
sheen
to
be
a
dumb
girl
and
she
gave
her
food
and
shelter
for
the
services
she
did
bringing
water
from
the
well
in
the
daytime
and
grinding
corn
at
the
quern
at
dusk
she
had
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
for
her
own
task
she
gathered
the
between
noon
and
sunset
and
spun
the
thread
at
night
when
she
had
lengths
of
thread
spun
she
began
to
weave
them
on
the
loom
at
the
end
of
a
year
she
had
the
first
shirt
made
in
another
year
she
made
the
second
then
the
third
then
the
fourth
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
and
all
the
time
she
said
no
word
laughed
no
laugh
and
cried
no
tear
she
was
gathering
the
for
the
seventh
and
last
shirt
once
she
went
abroad
on
a
day
when
the
snow
was
melted
and
she
felt
her
footsteps
light
hundreds
of
birds
were
on
the
ground
eating
plentifully
and
calling
to
one
another
sheen
could
hardly
keep
from
her
mouth
the
song
that
was
in
her
mind
she
would
sing
and
laugh
and
talk
when
the
last
thread
was
spun
and
woven
when
the
last
stitch
was
sewn
and
when
the
shirts
of
she
had
made
in
silence
would
have
brought
back
her
brothers
to
their
own
human
forms
she
gathered
the
scarce
heads
of
the
cannavan
or
with
one
hand
while
she
held
the
other
hand
to
her
lips
something
dropped
down
at
her
feet
it
was
a
white
grouse
and
it
remained
cowering
on
the
ground
sheen
looked
up
and
she
saw
a
hawk
above
and
when
she
looked
round
she
saw
a
man
coming
across
the
bog
the
hawk
flew
towards
him
and
lighted
on
his
shoulder
sheen
held
the
white
grouse
to
her
breast
the
man
came
near
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
and
his
voice
made
her
stand
he
wore
the
dress
of
a
hunter
his
face
was
brown
and
lean
and
his
eyes
were
like
no
word
did
sheen
say
to
him
and
he
passed
on
with
the
hawk
on
his
shoulder
then
with
the
grouse
held
at
her
breast
she
went
back
to
the
s
house
that
night
when
she
spun
her
thread
she
thought
of
the
man
would
any
of
her
brothers
be
like
him
she
wondered
when
they
were
restored
to
their
human
shapes
she
fed
the
white
grouse
with
grains
of
corn
and
left
it
to
rest
in
the
above
her
bed
and
then
she
lay
awake
and
tried
to
know
the
meaning
in
the
song
the
sang
when
she
sat
spinning
wool
in
the
chimney
corner
you
would
not
slumber
if
laid
at
my
breast
little
sister
i
ll
rock
you
to
rest
the
flood
on
the
river
beats
the
swan
from
its
nest
you
would
not
slumber
if
laid
at
my
breast
the
encumber
the
hawthorn
s
crest
my
thoughts
have
no
number
you
would
not
slumber
if
laid
at
my
breast
little
sister
i
ll
rock
you
to
rest
she
passed
the
night
between
sleeping
and
waking
and
when
the
light
grew
she
saw
the
white
grouse
crouching
against
the
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
outside
to
let
the
grouse
fly
from
her
hands
and
there
on
the
ground
before
her
was
a
sword
sheen
knew
it
to
be
the
sword
of
the
man
she
had
seen
yesterday
and
she
knew
the
man
had
been
before
the
door
in
the
she
knelt
on
the
ground
to
look
at
the
bright
blue
blade
o
my
listeners
if
i
was
there
i
was
in
the
crows
that
flew
down
heavily
and
cawed
as
they
picked
up
something
that
pleased
them
in
the
that
cooed
in
the
trees
in
the
small
birds
that
quarreled
in
the
thatch
of
the
house
and
in
the
breeze
that
blew
round
the
first
breeze
of
the
day
the
came
outside
and
saw
what
sheen
was
looking
at
the
sword
on
the
ground
it
is
wrought
with
cunning
that
only
the
smiths
of
kings
possess
she
said
she
took
the
sword
and
hung
it
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
so
that
the
dews
of
the
ground
might
not
rust
it
i
think
the
one
who
owns
it
is
the
stranger
who
is
seen
in
the
wild
places
hereabouts
the
man
whom
the
neighbors
call
the
she
said
to
sheen
on
another
day
sheen
went
to
gather
this
time
she
crossed
the
river
by
the
and
went
into
a
country
where
there
were
many
cattle
she
stood
wondering
at
their
numbers
and
wishing
that
such
a
cow
and
such
a
calf
might
belong
to
the
then
the
next
thing
she
saw
was
two
black
horses
striving
with
each
other
they
showed
their
teeth
at
each
other
and
bit
and
kicked
then
they
came
racing
towards
her
oh
said
sheen
to
herself
they
are
breogan
s
wild
she
ran
but
the
horses
were
able
to
make
circles
round
her
breogan
s
wild
stallions
said
she
they
will
rush
in
and
trample
me
to
then
she
heard
someone
shouting
commands
to
the
horses
she
saw
a
man
strike
one
of
the
stallions
with
a
staff
making
him
rear
high
she
saw
him
make
the
other
stand
with
the
command
that
was
in
his
voice
she
ran
to
the
river
but
she
slipped
on
the
she
fell
down
and
she
felt
the
water
flowing
upon
her
the
man
came
and
lifting
her
up
carried
her
to
her
own
side
of
the
river
across
the
bog
he
carried
her
and
when
she
looked
at
him
she
saw
the
lean
face
and
eyes
blue
like
she
saw
the
face
of
the
man
who
was
called
the
he
left
her
on
the
ground
when
they
passed
the
bog
and
she
went
on
her
way
without
speaking
nothing
of
this
no
more
than
of
anything
else
that
happened
to
her
or
anything
that
she
thought
of
did
sheen
tell
the
but
she
wished
and
she
wished
that
the
might
come
past
while
there
was
a
light
in
the
house
and
step
within
and
talk
to
the
so
that
she
herself
while
spinning
the
thread
could
hear
his
voice
and
listen
to
the
things
he
talked
about
she
often
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
across
the
bog
to
see
if
anything
was
coming
to
her
a
came
across
the
one
evening
and
sheen
went
into
the
house
after
her
for
she
felt
that
something
was
going
to
be
told
there
was
a
dead
man
in
a
house
he
had
been
found
in
the
wood
he
was
known
as
the
sheen
stood
at
her
bed
and
heard
what
the
said
the
was
being
waked
in
the
s
house
and
her
eldest
daughter
had
been
the
the
first
night
in
the
morning
they
found
that
the
girl
s
hand
had
been
withered
the
woman
s
second
daughter
was
the
the
second
night
and
her
right
hand
had
been
left
trembling
this
was
the
third
and
last
night
that
the
would
be
waked
and
there
was
no
one
to
watch
his
corpse
sheen
thought
that
nothing
would
ever
happen
in
the
world
again
now
that
the
was
dead
she
thought
that
there
was
no
loneliness
so
great
as
that
of
his
corpse
with
no
one
to
watch
it
on
the
last
strange
night
it
would
be
above
ground
the
went
from
the
and
sheen
went
after
her
she
was
standing
on
the
of
her
house
oh
colleen
said
the
i
am
wanting
a
girl
to
watch
a
corpse
in
my
house
the
third
and
the
last
night
for
watching
will
you
watch
and
i
will
give
you
a
comb
for
your
hair
sheen
showed
that
she
would
serve
the
woman
and
she
went
into
the
at
first
she
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
bed
then
she
went
over
and
saw
the
with
his
face
still
his
eyes
closed
down
and
the
plate
of
salt
on
his
breast
his
gray
gaunt
hound
was
stretched
across
his
feet
the
woman
and
her
daughters
lighted
candles
and
placed
them
in
the
window
recesses
and
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
then
they
went
into
their
and
left
sheen
to
her
watching
she
sat
at
the
fire
and
made
one
fagot
after
another
blaze
up
she
had
brought
her
basket
of
and
she
began
to
spin
a
thread
upon
the
s
wheel
she
finished
the
thread
and
put
it
round
her
neck
then
she
began
to
search
for
more
candles
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
light
one
as
another
went
out
but
as
she
rose
up
all
the
candles
went
out
all
at
once
the
hound
started
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
then
she
saw
the
corpse
sitting
up
stiffly
in
the
place
where
it
had
been
laid
something
in
sheen
overcame
her
dread
and
she
went
over
to
the
corpse
and
took
the
salt
that
was
on
its
breast
and
put
it
on
its
lips
then
a
voice
came
from
between
the
lips
fair
maid
said
the
voice
have
you
the
courage
to
follow
me
the
others
failed
me
and
they
have
been
stricken
are
you
faithful
i
will
follow
you
said
sheen
then
said
the
corpse
put
your
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
come
with
me
i
must
go
over
the
quaking
bog
and
through
the
burning
forest
and
across
the
icy
sheen
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
a
storm
came
and
they
were
swept
through
the
roof
of
the
house
they
were
carried
through
the
night
down
they
came
on
the
ground
and
the
dead
man
sprang
away
from
sheen
she
went
to
follow
him
and
found
her
feet
upon
a
shaking
sod
they
were
on
the
quaking
bog
she
knew
the
corpse
of
the
went
ahead
and
she
knew
that
she
must
keep
it
in
sight
he
went
swiftly
the
sod
went
under
her
feet
and
she
was
in
the
watery
mud
she
struggled
out
and
jumped
over
a
pool
that
was
hidden
with
heather
all
the
time
she
was
in
dread
that
the
figure
that
went
before
her
so
quickly
would
be
lost
to
her
she
sank
and
she
struggled
and
she
sprang
across
pools
and
morasses
all
the
time
what
had
been
the
corpse
of
the
went
before
her
then
she
saw
fires
against
the
sky
and
she
knew
they
were
coming
to
the
burning
forest
the
figure
before
her
sprang
across
a
ditch
and
went
into
the
forest
sheen
sprang
across
it
too
burning
branches
fell
across
her
path
as
she
went
on
hot
winds
burnt
her
face
flames
dazzled
and
smoke
dazed
her
but
the
figure
before
her
went
straight
on
and
sheen
went
straight
on
too
the
forest
ended
on
a
cliff
below
was
the
sea
the
figure
before
her
dived
down
and
sheen
dived
too
the
cold
chilled
her
to
the
marrow
she
thought
the
chill
would
drive
the
life
out
of
her
but
she
saw
the
head
of
one
swimming
before
her
and
she
swam
on
and
then
they
were
on
land
again
fair
maid
said
the
corpse
of
the
put
your
hands
on
my
shoulders
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
a
storm
came
and
swept
them
away
they
were
driven
through
the
roof
of
the
s
house
the
fluttered
and
light
came
on
them
again
she
saw
the
hound
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
she
saw
the
corpse
sitting
where
it
had
been
laid
and
the
eyes
were
now
open
fair
maid
said
the
voice
of
the
you
have
brought
me
back
to
life
i
am
a
man
under
enchantment
there
is
a
in
the
wood
that
i
gave
my
love
to
she
enchanted
me
so
that
the
soul
was
out
of
my
body
and
wandering
away
it
was
my
soul
you
followed
and
the
enchantment
was
to
be
broken
when
i
found
a
heart
so
faithful
that
it
would
follow
my
soul
over
the
quaking
bog
through
the
burning
forest
and
across
the
icy
sea
you
have
brought
my
soul
and
my
life
back
to
then
she
ran
out
of
the
neighbor
s
house
the
night
after
in
the
s
house
she
finished
weaving
the
threads
that
were
on
the
loom
the
next
night
she
stitched
the
cloth
and
made
the
sixth
shirt
the
day
after
she
went
into
the
bog
to
gather
the
for
the
seventh
shirt
she
had
gathered
her
basketful
and
was
going
through
the
wood
about
the
hour
of
sunset
at
the
edge
of
the
thin
wood
she
saw
the
standing
he
took
her
hands
and
his
were
warm
hands
his
brown
face
and
his
eyes
were
high
and
noble
and
sheen
felt
a
joy
like
the
sharpness
of
a
sword
when
he
sang
to
her
about
the
brightness
of
her
hair
and
the
blue
of
her
eyes
o
maid
said
he
is
there
anything
that
binds
you
to
this
place
sheen
showed
him
the
in
the
basket
and
the
woven
thread
that
was
round
her
neck
come
with
me
to
my
kingdom
said
he
and
you
shall
be
my
wife
and
the
love
of
my
the
next
evening
sheen
went
with
him
she
took
the
six
shirts
she
had
spun
and
woven
and
stitched
the
lifted
her
before
him
on
a
black
horse
and
they
rode
into
his
kingdom
and
now
sheen
was
the
wife
of
the
she
would
have
been
happy
if
her
husband
s
sisters
had
been
kind
but
they
were
jealous
and
they
made
everything
in
the
castle
unfriendly
to
her
and
often
they
talked
before
her
brother
saying
that
sheen
was
not
noble
at
all
and
that
the
reason
she
did
not
speak
was
because
her
language
was
a
base
one
they
watched
her
when
she
went
out
to
gather
in
the
daytime
and
they
watched
her
when
she
spun
by
herself
at
night
sheen
longed
for
the
days
and
nights
to
pass
so
that
the
last
threads
might
be
spun
and
woven
and
the
last
stitches
put
in
the
seventh
shirt
then
her
brothers
would
be
with
her
she
could
tell
the
king
about
herself
and
silence
the
bad
talk
of
his
sisters
but
as
she
neared
the
end
of
her
task
she
became
more
and
more
in
dread
the
threads
were
spun
and
woven
for
the
seventh
shirt
the
cloth
was
made
and
the
first
stitches
were
put
in
it
then
sheen
s
little
son
was
born
the
king
was
away
at
the
time
gathering
his
men
together
at
far
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
he
sent
a
message
saying
that
sheen
and
her
baby
were
to
be
and
that
his
sisters
were
not
to
leave
the
chamber
where
she
was
until
he
returned
on
the
third
night
while
sheen
was
in
her
bed
with
her
baby
beside
her
and
while
her
were
in
the
room
a
strange
music
was
heard
outside
it
was
played
all
round
the
king
s
house
whoever
heard
it
fell
into
deep
slumber
the
kern
that
were
on
guard
slept
the
maids
that
were
whispering
together
fell
into
a
slumber
and
a
deep
sleep
came
upon
sheen
and
her
child
and
on
her
three
who
watched
in
the
chamber
then
a
gray
wolf
that
had
been
seen
outside
sprang
in
through
the
window
opening
he
took
sheen
s
child
in
his
mouth
he
sprang
back
through
the
window
opening
and
was
seen
about
the
place
no
more
her
wakened
while
sheen
still
slept
they
went
to
tend
it
and
found
the
child
was
gone
then
they
were
afraid
of
what
their
brother
would
do
to
them
for
letting
this
happen
they
made
a
plot
to
clear
themselves
and
before
sheen
wakened
they
had
killed
a
little
beast
and
smeared
its
blood
upon
the
pillows
of
the
bed
when
the
king
came
into
his
wife
s
chamber
he
saw
his
sisters
on
the
ground
lamenting
and
tearing
the
hairs
out
of
their
heads
he
went
to
where
his
wife
was
sleeping
and
saw
blood
upon
her
hands
and
upon
the
pillows
he
turned
on
his
sisters
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
they
cried
out
that
they
could
not
have
prevented
the
thing
that
had
happened
that
the
queen
had
laid
hands
on
the
child
and
having
killed
it
had
thrown
its
body
to
the
gray
wolf
that
had
been
watching
outside
and
while
they
were
speaking
sheen
awakened
she
put
out
her
arms
but
her
child
was
not
beside
her
she
found
blood
upon
the
pillows
then
she
heard
her
accuse
her
to
the
king
of
having
killed
her
child
and
flung
its
body
to
the
gray
wolf
outside
she
fell
into
a
swoon
and
when
she
came
out
of
it
her
mind
was
lost
to
her
the
king
knelt
to
her
and
begged
her
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
but
she
only
knew
she
was
to
say
no
word
then
he
used
to
watch
her
and
he
wondered
why
she
cried
no
tear
on
the
fourth
day
after
she
rose
from
her
bed
and
searched
the
castle
for
the
piece
of
cloth
she
had
spun
and
woven
out
of
the
she
found
it
and
began
to
sew
it
for
the
seventh
shirt
the
king
s
sisters
came
to
him
and
said
the
woman
you
brought
here
is
of
another
race
from
ours
she
has
forgotten
that
a
child
was
born
to
her
and
that
she
killed
it
and
flung
its
body
to
the
gray
wolf
she
sits
there
now
just
stitching
a
the
king
went
and
saw
her
stitching
and
stitching
as
if
her
life
depended
on
each
stitch
she
put
into
the
cloth
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
looked
up
but
did
not
speak
then
the
king
s
heart
was
hardened
he
took
her
and
brought
her
outside
the
gate
of
the
castle
go
back
to
the
people
you
came
from
said
he
for
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
be
here
and
not
speak
to
me
of
what
has
sheen
knew
she
was
being
sent
from
the
house
he
had
brought
her
to
a
bitter
cry
came
from
her
then
the
stitched
cloth
that
was
in
her
hand
became
and
was
blown
away
on
the
breeze
when
she
saw
this
happen
she
turned
from
the
king
s
castle
and
ran
through
the
woods
crying
and
crying
she
went
through
the
woods
for
many
days
living
on
berries
and
the
water
of
springs
at
last
she
came
to
the
s
house
the
was
before
the
door
and
she
welcomed
sheen
back
she
gave
her
drinks
she
had
made
from
strange
herbs
and
in
a
season
sheen
s
mind
and
health
came
back
to
her
and
she
knew
all
that
had
happened
she
thought
she
would
win
back
her
seven
brothers
and
then
with
their
help
win
back
her
child
and
her
husband
but
she
knew
she
would
have
to
gather
the
spin
the
threads
and
weave
them
all
over
again
as
her
tears
and
cries
had
broken
her
task
she
told
her
story
to
the
then
she
went
into
silence
again
gathering
the
and
spinning
the
thread
but
when
the
first
thread
was
spun
the
memory
of
her
child
blew
against
her
heart
and
she
cried
tears
down
the
thread
she
had
spun
became
and
was
blown
away
for
days
she
wept
and
wept
then
the
said
to
her
commit
the
child
you
have
lost
to
diachbha
that
is
to
destiny
and
diachbha
may
bring
it
about
that
he
shall
be
the
one
that
will
restore
your
seven
brothers
their
human
forms
and
when
you
have
committed
your
lost
little
son
to
diachbha
go
back
to
your
husband
and
tell
him
all
you
have
lived
sheen
believing
in
the
s
wisdom
did
what
was
told
her
she
made
an
image
of
her
lost
little
son
with
leaves
and
left
it
on
the
top
of
the
house
where
it
was
blown
away
by
the
winds
then
she
was
ready
to
go
back
to
her
husband
and
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
in
her
life
but
on
the
day
she
was
bringing
the
last
pitcher
of
water
from
the
well
she
met
him
on
the
path
before
her
do
you
remember
that
i
carried
you
across
the
bog
he
said
and
do
you
remember
that
i
followed
your
soul
said
she
these
were
the
first
words
she
ever
spoke
to
him
they
went
back
together
to
the
s
and
she
told
him
all
that
had
been
in
her
life
he
told
her
how
his
sisters
had
acknowledged
that
they
had
spoken
falsely
against
her
he
took
her
back
to
his
own
kingdom
and
there
as
king
and
queen
they
still
live
but
the
name
she
bears
is
not
sheen
or
storm
now
two
sons
more
were
born
to
her
but
her
seven
brothers
are
still
seven
wild
geese
and
the
queen
has
found
no
trace
of
her
son
but
the
has
had
a
dream
and
the
dream
has
revealed
this
to
her
the
son

sheen
lost

driving
a
load
of
hay
to
the
fair
and
when
he
got
into
the

he
lay
against
the
hay
and
slept
when

parted
with
the

cut
a
holly
stick
and
journeyed
along
the
road
by
himself
at
the
fall
of
night
he
came
to
a
place
that
made
him
think
he
had
been
there
before

looked
around
and
then
he
knew
that
this
was
the
place
he
had

the
crystal
egg

looked
to
see
if
the

them
out
until

and
three
in
the

bold
and
he
spoke
so
bold
that
the
robbers
began
to
think
he
might
have
some
reason
for
talking
as
he
did
they
left
him
and
went
off
to
their
beds
gilly

one
robber
and
i
couldn

said
the
captain
of

the
goat
before
you
are
through

your
he
went
outside
gilly
knew
that
country
well
and
he
ran
through
the
wood
until
he
was
a
bend
of
the
road
ahead
of
the
farmer
who
was
leading
his
goat
to
the
fair
he
took
off
one
shoe
and
left
it
in
the
middle
of
the
road

ran
on
then
until
he
was
round
another
bend
of
the
road
he
took
off
the
other

and
left
it
down
then
he
hid
behind
the
hedge
and
waited
the
farmer
came
to
where
the
first
shoe
was
that
s
not
a
bad
shoe
said
he
and
if
there
was
a
comrade
for
it
it
would
be
worth
picking

went
on
then
and
came
to
where
the
other
shoe
was
lying
here
is
the
comrade
said
he
and
it
s
worth
my
while
now
to
go
back
for
the
he
tied
the
goat
to
the
and
went
back
as
soon
as
the

hedge
he
brought
it
to
the
house
before
the
robbers
were
through
with
their

were
all
terribly
surprised
the
captain
began
to
bite
at
his
nails
the
farmer
with
the
two
shoes
under

arm
came
to
where
he
had
left
the

never
stop
scolding
me
if

back
to
her
now
with
one
hand
as
long
as
the

is
in
good
humor
on

to
the
field

down
to
a
game
of

after
breakfast
the
six
robbers
and
gilly
when
they

the
farmer
going
past
with
the
sheep
i

sheep
more
closely
than
he
watched
the
goat
said
one
of

that
bird
now
said
gilly
on

waves
of

then
they
showed
him
the
bird
that
was
on
the
waves
of
the
lake
a
swan
she
was
and
she
floated
proudly
the
swan
came
towards
them
and
as
she
drew
nearer
they
could
hear
her
voice
the
sounds
she
made
were
not
like
any
sound
of
birds
but
like
the
sounds
bards
make
chanting
their
verses
words
came
on
high
notes
and
low
notes
but
they
were
like
words
in
a
strange
language
and
still
the
swan
chanted
as
she
drew
near
to
the
shore
where
gilly
and
the
six
robbers
stood
she
spread
out
her
wings
and
raising
her
neck
she
curved
it
while
she
stayed
watching
the
men
on
the
bank
hear
the
swan
of
endless
tales
the
swan
of
endless
tales
she
sang
in
words
they
knew
then
she
raised
herself
out
of
the
water
turned
round
in
the
air
and
flew
back
to
the
middle
of
the
lake
time
for
us
to
be
leaving
the
place
when
there
is
a
bird
on
the
lake
that
can
speak
like
that
said
mogue
who

been
the
captain
of
the
robbers

this
place
said
gilly
of
the
goatskin
the
robbers
went
away
from
him
and
back
to
the
house
and
gilly
sat
by
the
edge
of
the
lake
waiting
to
see
if
the
swan
of
endless
tales
would
come
back
and
tell
him
something
she
did
not
come
as
gilly
sat
there
the
farmer
who
had
lost
his
goat
his
sheep
and
his
bullock
came
by
he
was
dragging
one
foot
after
the
other
and
looking
very
downcast
what
is
the
matter
with
you
honest
man
said
gilly
the
farmer
told
him
how
he
had
lost
his
goat
his
sheep
and
his
bullock
he
told
him
how
he
had
thought
he
heard
his
goat
bleating
and
his
sheep
ba
ing
and
how
he
went
through
the
wood
to
search
for
them
and
how
his
bullock
was
gone
when
he
came
back
to
the
road
and
what
to
say
to
my
wife
ann
i
don
t
know
said
he
particularly
as
i
have
brought
no
shawl
to
put
her
in
good
humor
heavy
is
the
blame
she
ll
give
me
on
account
of
my
losing
a
goat
a
sheep
and
a
gilly
took
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
do
you
see
this
key
said
he
take
it
and
open
the
byre
door
at
such
a
place
and
you
ll
find
in
that
byre
your
goat
your
sheep
and
your
bullock
there
are
robbers
in
that
house
but
if
they
try
to
prevent
your
taking
your
own
tell
them
that
all
the
threshers
of
the
country
are
coming
to
beat
them
with
the
farmer
took
the
key
and
went
away
very
thankful
to
gilly
the
story
says
that
he
got
back
his
goat
his
sheep
and
his
bullock
and
made
it
an
excuse
that
he
had
seen
three
magpies
on
the
road
for
not
going
to
the
fair
to
buy
a
shawl
for
his
wife
ann
the
robbers
were
very
frightened
when
he
told
them
about
the
threshers
coming
and
they
went
away
from
that
part
of
the
country
as
for
gilly
he
thought
he
would
go
back
to
the
old
woman
of
beare
for
his
name
he
took
the
path
by
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
as
he
journeyed
along
with
his
in
his
hand
he
heard
the
swan
of
endless
tales
chanting
the
town
of
the
red
castle
i
flann
was
the
name
that
the
old
woman
of
beare
gave
to
gilly
of
the
goatskin
when
he
came
back
to
tell
her
that
the
swan
of
endless
tales
had
been
hatched
out
of
the
crystal
egg
he
went
from
her
house
then
and
came
to
where
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
waited
for
him
the
two
comrades
went
along
a
road
as
they
went
on
they
fell
in
with
men
driving
herds
of
ponies
men
carrying
packs
on
their
backs
men
with
tools
for
working
gold
and
silver
bronze
and
iron
every
man
whom
they
asked
said
we
are
going
to
the
town
of
the
red
castle
and
to
the
great
fair
that
will
be
held
the
king
s
son
and
flann
thought
they
should
go
to
the
town
of
the
red
castle
too
for
where
so
many
people
would
be
there
was
a
chance
of
hearing
what
went
before
and
what
came
after
the
unique
tale
so
they
went
on
and
when
they
had
come
to
a
well
that
was
under
a
great
rock
those
whom
they
were
with
halted
they
said
it
was
the
custom
for
the
merchants
and
sellers
to
wait
there
for
a
day
and
to
go
into
the
town
of
the
red
castle
the
day
following
on
this
day
they
said
the
people
of
the
town
celebrate
the
festival
of
midsummer
and
they
do
not
like
a
great
company
of
people
to
go
into
their
town
until
the
festival
is
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
flann
went
on
and
they
were
let
into
the
town
the
people
had
lighted
great
fires
in
their
and
they
were
driving
their
cattle
through
the
fires
if
there
be
evil
on
you
may
it
burn
may
it
burn
they
were
crying
they
were
afraid
that
witches
and
enchanters
might
come
into
the
town
with
the
merchants
and
the
sellers
and
that
was
the
reason
they
did
not
permit
a
great
company
to
enter
the
fires
in
all
their
houses
had
been
quenched
that
day
and
they
might
not
be
lighted
except
from
the
fires
the
cattle
had
gone
through
the
fires
were
left
blazing
high
and
the
king
s
son
and
flann
spent
hours
watching
them
and
watching
the
crowds
that
were
around
then
the
time
came
to
take
fire
to
the
houses
they
who
came
for
fire
were
all
young
maidens
each
came
into
the
light
of
one
of
the
great
fires
took
coals
from
a
fire
that
had
burnt
low
placed
them
in
a
new
earthen
vessel
and
went
away
flann
thought
that
all
the
maidens
were
beautiful
and
wonderful
although
the
king
s
son
told
him
that
some
were
and
some
and
some
hunchbacked
then
a
maiden
came
who
was
so
high
above
the
rest
that
flann
had
no
words
to
speak
of
her
she
had
silver
on
her
head
and
silver
on
her
arms
and
the
people
around
the
fires
all
bowed
to
her
she
had
black
black
hair
and
she
had
a
smiling
face
not
happily
smiling
but
proudly
smiling
flann
thought
that
a
star
had
bent
down
with
her
and
when
she
had
taken
the
fire
and
had
gone
away
flann
said
she
is
surely
the
king
s
daughter
she
is
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
people
here
have
spoken
her
what
is
her
name
asked
flann
it
is
lassarina
said
the
king
s
son
shall
we
see
her
again
said
flann
that
i
do
not
know
said
the
king
s
son
come
now
and
let
us
ask
the
people
here
if
they
have
knowledge
of
the
unique
wait
said
flann
they
are
talking
about
princess
he
did
not
move
but
listened
to
what
was
said
all
said
that
the
king
s
daughter
was
proud
some
said
she
was
beautiful
but
others
answered
that
her
lips
were
thin
and
her
eyes
were
mocking
no
other
maidens
came
for
fire
flann
stood
before
the
one
that
still
blazed
and
thought
and
thought
the
king
s
son
asked
many
if
they
had
knowledge
of
the
unique
tale
but
no
one
had
heard
of
it
some
told
him
that
there
would
be
merchants
and
sellers
from
many
parts
of
the
world
at
the
fair
that
would
be
held
on
the
morrow
and
that
there
would
be
a
chance
of
meeting
one
who
had
knowledge
of
it
then
the
king
s
son
went
with
one
who
brought
him
to
a
brufir
s
that
is
to
a
house
of
hospitality
maintained
by
the
king
for
strangers
as
for
flann
he
sat
looking
into
the
fire
until
it
died
down
and
then
he
slept
before
it
ii
flann
was
wakened
by
a
gander
and
his
flock
of
geese
that
stood
round
him
shook
their
wings
and
set
up
their
it
was
day
then
although
there
was
still
a
star
in
the
sky
he
threw
where
there
was
a
glow
and
made
a
fire
blaze
up
again
then
the
dogs
of
the
town
came
down
to
look
at
him
and
then
stole
away
horns
were
blown
outside
and
the
watchman
opened
the
gates
flann
shook
himself
and
stood
up
to
see
the
folk
that
were
coming
in
first
came
the
men
who
drove
the
mountain
ponies
that
had
lately
fed
with
the
deer
in
wild
places
then
came
men
in
leathern
jerkins
who
led
bulls
a
black
bull
and
a
white

and
a
white

and
a

closed
in
packs
that
merchants
carried
on
their
shoulders
the
famous
bards
and
and
harpists
would
not
come
until
when
the
business
of
the
fair
would
have
abated
but
with
the
crowd
of
beggars
came
and
the
tellers
of
the
stories

they

and
sat
on
the
benches
to
wait
for
the
king
s
steward
who
would
receive
them
and
while
they
waited
they
watched
the
play
of
a
pet
fox
in
the
courtyard
flann
was
wondering
all
the
time
if
the
princess
would
pass
through
the
or
come
into
the
hall
where
they
waited
then
he
saw
her
come
up
the
courtyard
she
saw
the
youths
in
the
hall
and
she
turned
round
to
watch
the
pet
fox
for
a
while
then
she
came
into
the
chamber
and
stood
near
the
door
she
wore
a
mask
across
her
face
but
her
brow
and
mouth
and
chin
were
shown
the
youths
saluted
her
and
she
bent
her
head
to
them
one
of
the
women
who
had
brought
birds
to
the
fair
followed
her
bringing
a
cage
talked
to
this
woman
in
a
strange
language
although
she
talked
to
the
woman
flann
saw
that
she
watched
his
three
companions
him
she
did
not
notice
because
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
was
behind
the
others
looked
at
the
king
s
son
first
and
then
turned
her
eyes
from
him
she
bent
her
head
to
listen
to
what
downal
and
dermott
were
saying
flann
she
did
not
look
at
at
all
and
he
became
sick
at
heart
of
the
red
castle
the
king
s
steward
came
into
the
hall
and
when
he
announced
who
the
youths
were
three
sons
of
the
king
of

might
be
pleasant
for
you
to
hear
music
in
the
king
s
she
smiled
on
downal
and
dermott
and
on
the
king
s
son
and
went
out
of
the
chamber
the
king
s
steward
feasted
the
four
youths
and
afterwards
made
them
presents
but
flann
did
not
heed
what
he
ate
nor
what
he
heard
said
nor
what
present
was
given
him
iii
the
four
youths
left
the
castle
and
downal
and
dermott
took
their
own
way
when
they
came
to
the
that
was
across
the
river
then
when
they
were
crossing
it
the
king
s
son
and
flann
saw
two
figures
a
sturdy
man
and
an
old
woman

they
went
to
them
each
wishing
to
greet
his
friend
and
helper
there
they
saw
a
sturdy
man
and
a
old
woman
but
the
woman
looking
on
the
man
saw
one
who
had
full
wisdom
to
plan
and
full
strength
to
build
whose
wisdom
and
whose
strength
could
neither
grow
nor
diminish
and
the
man
looking
on
the
woman
saw
one
whose
brow
had
all
quiet
whose
heart
had
all
benignity
hail
gobaun
builder
for
the
gods

the
woman

then
the
two
youths
came
swiftly
up
to
them
and
the

greeted
the

and

away
and
walked
along
the
road
that
went
out
of
the
town
the
had
brought
besoms
to
the
town
to
sell
she
showed
the
two
youths
the
little
house
she
lived
in
while
she
was
there
it
was
filled
with
the
which
she
bound
together
for
besoms
they
left
the
and
went
through
the
town
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
searching
every
place
for
a
man
he
knew
or
a
horse
he
had
mounted
before
while
flann
thought
about
the
princess
and
how
little
she
considered
him
beside
the
king
s
son
and
dermott
and
downal
they
came
to
where
a
crowd
was
standing
before
a
conjurer
s
booth
they
halted
and
stood
waiting
for
the
conjurer
to
appear
he
came
out
and
put
a
ladder
standing
upright
with
nothing
to
lean
against
and
began
climbing
up
up
up
up
he
went
and
the
ladder
grew
higher
and
higher
as
he
climbed
flann
thought
he
would
climb
into
the
sky
then
the
ladder
got
smaller
and
smaller
and
flann
saw
the
conjurer
coming
down
on
the
other
side
he
has
come
here
to
take
that
horse
said
a
voice
behind
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
king
s
son
looked
round
and
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
he
saw
a
man
with
a
cap
and
a
protruding
eye
who
was
holding
a
reddish
horse
while
he
watched
the
conjuror
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
knew
the
horse
it
was
the
slight
red
steed
that
had
carried
him
and
fedelma
from
the
enchanter
s
house
and
had
brought
him
to
the
cave
where
he
had
found
the
sword
of
light
he
looked
at
the
conjuror
again
and
he
saw
he
was
no
other
than
the
enchanter
of
the
black
then
it
crossed
his
mind
what
the
gobaun
saor
had
said
to
him
he
had
seen
a
man
he
knew
and
a
horse
he
had
mounted
before
he
was
to
mount
that
horse
follow
the
man
and
force
him
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
unique
tale
the
king
s
son
drew
back
to
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
he
snatched
the
bridle
from
the
hands
of
mogue
the
man
who
held
it
and
jumped
up
on
the
back
of
the
slight
red
steed
as
soon
as
he
did
this
the
ladder
that
was
standing
upright
fell
on
the
ground
the
people
shouted
and
broke
away
and
then
the
king
s
son
saw
the
enchanter
jump
across
a
house
and
make
for
the
gate
of
the
town
but
if
he
could
jump
across
a
house
so
could
the
slight
red
steed
the
king
s
son
turned
its
head
plucked
at
its
rein
and
over
the
same
house
it
sprang
too
the
more
he
ran
the
more
swift
the
enchanter
became
he
jumped
over
the
gate
of
the
town
the
slight
red
steed
after
him
he
went
swiftly
across
the
country
making
high
springs
over
ditches
and
hedges
no
other
steed
but
the
slight
red
steed
could
have
kept
its
rider
in
sight
of
him
iv
up
hill
and
down
dale
the
enchanter
went
but
mounted
on
the
slight
red
steed
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
in
hot
pursuit
the
enchanter
raced
up
the
side
of
the
seventh
hill
and
when
the
king
s
son
came
to
the
top
of
it
he
found
no
one
in
sight
he
raced
on
however
and
he
passed
a
dead
man
hanging
from
a
tree
he
raced
on
and
on
but
still
the
enchanter
was
not
to
be
seen
then
the
thought
came
into
his
mind
that
the
man
who
was
hanging
from
the
tree
and
who
he
thought
was
dead
was
the
crafty
old
enchanter
he
turned
the
slight
red
steed
round
and
raced
back
the
man
that
had
been
hanging
from
the
tree
was
there
no
longer
the
king
s
son
turned
his
horse
amongst
the
trees
and
began
to
search
for
the
enchanter
he
found
no
trace
of
him
i
have
lost
again
he
said
then
he
threw
the
bridle
on
the
neck
of
the
horse
and
he
said
go
your
own
way
now
my
slight
red
when
he
said
that
the
slight
red
steed
twitched
its
ears
and
galloped
towards
the
west
it
went
through
woods
and
across
streams
and
when
the
crows
were
flying
home
and
the
kites
were
flying
abroad
it
brought
the
king
s
son
to
a
stone
house
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
bog
it
may
be
the
enchanter
is
in
this
house
said
the
king
s
son
he
jumped
off
the
slight
red
steed
pushed
the
door
of
the
house
open
and
there
seated
on
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
a
woman
sitting
beside
him
was
the
enchanter
of
the
black
so
said
the
enchanter
my
slight
red
steed
has
brought
you
to
so
said
the
king
s
son
i
have
found
you
my
crafty
old
and
now
that
you
have
found
me
what
do
you
want
of
me
said
the
enchanter
your
head
said
the
king
s
son
drawing
the
tarnished
sword
of
light
will
nothing
less
than
my
head
content
you
said
the
enchanter
nothing
less
unless
it
be
what
went
before
and
what
comes
after
the
unique
the
unique
tale
said
the
enchanter
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
of
thereupon
he
began
i
was
a
druid
and
the
son
of
a
druid
and
i
had
learned
the
language
of
the
birds
and
one
morning
as
i
walked
abroad
i
heard
a
blackbird
and
a
robin
talking
and
when
i
heard
what
they
said
i
smiled
to
myself
now
the
woman
i
had
just
married
noticed
that
i
kept
smiling
and
she
questioned
me
why
do
you
keep
smiling
to
yourself
i
would
not
tell
her
is
that
not
the
truth
said
the
enchanter
to
a
woman
who
sat
beside
him
it
is
the
truth
said
she
on
the
third
day
i
was
still
smiling
to
myself
and
my
wife
questioned
me
and
when
i
did
not
answer
threw
into
my
face
may
blindness
come
upon
you
if
you
do
not
tell
me
why
you
are
smiling
said
she
then
i
told
her
why
i
smiled
to
myself
i
had
heard
what
the
birds
said
the
blackbird
said
to
the
robin
do
you
know
that
just
under
where
we
are
sitting
are
three
rods
of
enchantment
and
if
one
were
to
take
one
of
them
and
strike
a
man
with
it
he
would
be
changed
to
any
creature
one
named
that
is
what
i
had
heard
the
birds
say
and
i
smiled
because
i
was
the
only
creature
who
knew
about
the
rods
of
enchantment
my
wife
made
me
show
her
where
the
rods
were
she
cut
one
of
them
when
i
went
away
that
evening
she
came
behind
me
and
struck
me
with
a
rod
go
out
now
and
roam
as
a
wolf
she
said
and
there
and
then
i
was
changed
into
a
wolf
is
that
not
true
said
he
to
the
woman
it
is
true
she
said
and
being
changed
into
a
wolf
i
went
through
the
woods
seeking
wolf
s
meat
and
now
you
must
ask
my
wife
to
tell
you
more
of
the
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
turned
to
the
woman
who
sat
on
the
seat
next
the
enchanter
and
asked
her
to
tell
him
more
of
the
story
and
thereupon
she
began
before
all
that
happened
i
was
known
as
the
maid
of
the
green
mantle
one
day
a
king
rode
up
a
mountain
with
five
score
followers
and
a
mist
came
on
them
as
they
rode
the
king
saw
his
followers
no
more
he
called
out
after
a
while
and
four
score
answered
him
and
he
called
out
again
after
another
while
and
two
score
answered
him
and
after
another
while
he
called
out
again
and
only
a
score
answered
him
through
the
mist
and
when
he
called
out
again
no
one
answered
him
at
all
the
king
went
up
the
mountain
until
he
came
to
the
place
where
i
lived
with
the
druids
who
reared
me
he
stayed
long
in
that
place
the
king
loved
me
for
a
while
and
i
loved
the
king
and
when
he
went
away
i
followed
him
because
he
would
not
come
back
to
me
i
enchanted
him
so
that
there
were
times
when
he
was
left
between
life
and
death
once
when
he
was
seemingly
dead
a
girl
watched
by
him
and
she
followed
his
spirit
into
many
terrible
places

the
king
of
ireland

the
enchanter
i
went
through
the
woods
searching
for
what
a
wolf
might
eat
but
could
find
nothing
to
stay
my
hunger
then
i
came
back
and
stood
outside
my
house
and
the
woman
who
had
been
called
the
maid
of
the
green
mantle
came
to
me
i
will

went
into
the
chamber
and
i
stole
the
child
from
the
mother

side
then
i
ran
through
the
woods
but
in
the
end
i
fell
into
a

child
to
one
of
them
telling
her
to

it
so
that

put
me
into
a
sack
promising
himself
that
he
would
give
me
a
good
beating

on
the
floor
of
his

and

into
a

again
is
that
not

he
to
the
woman
it
is

she
that

of
the
unique
tale

of
the
black
and
now
that
i
have
told

to
you

i
will

said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
until
you
tell
me
what
king
and
queen
were
the
father
and
mother
of
the
child
that
was
reared
by
the
hags
of
the
long
i
made
no
promise
to

that

now

me
see
your
back
going
through
my
yes
you
have
got
the
story
and
be
off
with
you
now
said
the
woman
who
sat
by
the
fire
he
put
up
his
sword
he
went
to
the
door
he
left
the
house
of
the
enchanter
of
the
black
he
mounted
the
slight
red
steed
and
rode
off
he
knew
now
what
went
before
and
what
came
after
the
unique
tale
the
gobaun
saor
would
clean
the
blemish
of
the
blade
of
the
sword
of
light
and
would
show
him
how
to
come
to
the
land
of
mist
then
he
would
win
back
his
love
fedelma
he
thought
too
on
the
tidings
he
had
for
his
comrade
flann
flann
was
the
son
of
the
king
who
was
called
the
and
of
sheen
whose
brothers
had
been
changed
into
seven
wild
geese
he
shook
his
horse
s
reins
and
went
back
towards
the
town
of
the
red
castle
v
flann
thought
upon
the
princess
he
walked
through
the
town
after
the
king
s
son
had
ridden
after
the
enchanter
without
noticing
anyone
until
he
heard
a
call
and
saw
mogue
standing
beside
a
little
tent
that
he
had
set
up
before
the
bull
s
field
flann
went
to
mogue
and
found
him
very
disconsolate
on
account
of
the
loss
of
the
horse
he
had
brought
into
the
town
this
is
a
bad
town
to
be
in
said
mogue
and
unless
i
persuade
yourself
to
become
partners
with
me
i
shall
have
done
badly
in
it
join
with
me
now
and
we
ll
do
some
fine
feats
it
would
not
become
a
king
s
son
to
join
with
a
said
flann
fine
talk
fine
talk
said
mogue
he
thought
that
flann
was
jesting
with
him
when
he
spoke
of
himself
as
a
king
s
son
i
want
to
sell
three
treasures
i
have
with
me
said
mogue
i
have
the
most
wonderful
things
that
were
ever
brought
into
this
show
them
to
me
said
flann
mogue
opened
one
of
his
packs
and
took
out
a
box
when
he
opened
this
box
a
fragrance
came
such
as
flann
had
never
felt
before
what
is
that
that
smells
like
a
garden
of
sweet
flowers
said
flann
it
is
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
said
mogue
and
he
took
a
little
rose
out
of
the
box
it
never
withers
and
its
fragrance
is
never
any
less
it
is
a
treasure
for
a
king
s
daughter
but
i
will
not
show
it
in
this
and
what
is
that
shining
thing
in
the
box
it
is
the
comb
of
magnificence
that
is
another
treasure
for
a
king
s
daughter
the
maiden
who
would
wear
it
would
look
the
most
queenly
woman
in
the
kingdom
but
i
won
t
show
that
what
else
have
you
mogue
a
girdle
the
woman
who
wears
it
would
have
to
speak
the
the
town
of
flann
thought
he
would
do
much
to
get
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
or
the
comb
of
magnificence
and
bring
them
as
presents
to
the
princess
he
slept
in
mogue
s
tent
and
at
the
peep
of
day
he
rose
up
and
went
to
the
house
of
hospitality
where
dermott
and
downal
were
with
them
he
would
go
to
the
king
s
orchard
and
he
would
see
and
perhaps
he
would
speak
to
but
dermott
and
downal
were
not
in
the
brufir
s
flann
wakened
their
grooms
and
he
and
they
made
search
for
the
two
youths
but
there
was
no
trace
of
dermott
and
downal
it
seemed
they
had
left
before
daybreak
with
their
horses
flann
went
with
the
grooms
to
the
gate
of
the
town
there
they
heard
from
the
watchman
that
the
two
youths
had
gone
through
the
gate
and
that
they
had
told
the
watchman
to
tell
the
grooms
that
they
had
gone
to
take
the
world
for
their
pillow
the
grooms
were
dismayed
to
hear
this
and
so
indeed
was
flann
without
the
king
s
son
and
without
downal
and
dermott
how
would
he
go
to
the
king
s
garden
he
went
back
to
mogue
s
tent
to
consider
what
he
should
do
and
first
he
thought
he
would
not
go
to
the
festival
of
the
gathering
of
the
apples
as
he
knew
that
had
only
asked
him
with
his
comrades
and
then
he
thought
that
whatever
else
happened
he
would
go
to
the
king
s
orchard
and
see
if
he
had
one
of
the
wonderful
things
that
mogue
had
shown
him
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
or
the
comb
of
magnificence
these
would
show
her
that
he
was
of
some
consequence
if
he
had
either
of
these
wonderful
things
and
offered
it
to
her
she
might
be
pleased
with
him
he
sat
outside
the
tent
and
waited
for
mogue
to
return
when
he
came
flann
said
to
him
i
will
go
with
you
as
a
servant
and
i
will
serve
you
well
although
i
am
a
king
s
son
if
you
will
give
me
something
what
do
you
want
from
me
said
mogue
give
me
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
said
flann
sure
that
s
the
finest
thing
i
have
i
couldn
t
give
you
i
will
serve
you
for
two
years
if
you
will
give
it
to
me
said
flann
no
said
mogue
i
will
serve
you
for
three
years
if
you
will
give
it
to
me
said
flann
i
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
will
serve
me
for
three
thereupon
mogue
opened
his
pack
and
took
the
box
out
he
opened
it
and
put
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
into
flann
s
hand
at
once
flann
started
off
for
the
king
s
orchard
the
steward
who
had
seen
him
the
day
before
signed
to
the
servants
to
let
him
pass
through
the
gate
he
went
into
the
king
s
orchard
maidens
were
singing
the
song
for
the
time
of
the
blossoming
of
the
and
all
that
day
and
night
flann
held
their
song
in
his
mind
the
touch
of
hands
that
drew
it
down
kindled
to
blossom
all
the
bough
o
breathe
the
wonder
of
the
branch
and
let
it
through
the
darkness
go
youths
were
gathering
apples
and
the
princess
walked
by
herself
on
the
orchard
paths
at
last
she
came
to
where
flann
stood
and
lifting
her
eyes
she
looked
at
him
i
had
companions
said
flann
but
they
have
gone
they
are
unmannerly
said
with
anger
and
she
turned
away
flann
took
the
rose
from
under
his
cloak
its
fragrance
came
to
and
she
turned
to
him
again
this
is
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
said
flann
will
you
take
it
from
me
princess
she
came
back
to
him
and
took
the
rose
in
her
hand
and
there
was
wonder
in
her
face
it
will
never
wither
and
its
fragrance
will
never
fail
said
flann
it
is
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
a
king
s
daughter
should
have
held
the
rose
in
her
hand
and
smiled
on
flann
what
is
your
name
king
s
son
said
she
with
bright
and
friendly
eyes
flann
he
said
walk
with
me
flann
said
she
they
walked
along
the
orchard
paths
and
the
youths
and
maidens
turned
towards
the
fragrance
that
the
rose
of
sweet
smells
gave
laughed
and
said
they
all
wonder
at
the
treasure
you
have
brought
me
flann
if
you
could
hear
what
i
shall
tell
them
about
you
i
shall
tell
them
that
you
are
the
son
of
a
king
of
arabia
no
less
they
will
believe
me
because
you
have
brought
me
such
a
treasure
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
more
wonderful
than
this
rose
then
flann
told
her
about
the
other
wonderful
thing
he
had
seen
the
comb
of
magnificence
a
king
s
daughter
should
have
such
a
treasure
said
oh
how
jealous
i
should
be
if
someone
brought
the
comb
of
magnificence
to
either
of
my
two
sisters
to
or
i
should
think
then
that
this
rose
was
not
such
a
treasure
after
when
he
was
leaving
the
orchard
she
plucked
a
flower
and
gave
it
to
him
come
and
walk
in
the
orchard
with
me
she
said
surely
i
will
come
said
flann
bring
the
comb
of
magnificence
to
me
too
said
she
i
could
not
be
proud
of
this
rose
and
i
could
not
love
you
so
well
for
bringing
it
to
me
if
i
thought
that
any
other
maiden
had
the
comb
of
magnificence
bring
it
to
me
i
will
bring
it
to
you
said
flann
vi
he
was
at
the
gate
of
the
town
when
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rode
back
on
the
slight
red
steed
the
king
s
son
dismounted
put
his
arm
about
flann
and
told
him
that
he
now
had
the
whole
of
the
unique
tale
they
sat
before
mogue
s
tent
and
the
king
s
son
told
flann
the
whole
of
the
story
he
had
searched
for
how
a
king
traveling
through
the
mist
had
come
to
where
druids
and
the
maid
of
the
green
mantle
lived
how
the
king
was
enchanted
and
how
the
maiden
sheen
released
him
from
the
enchantment
he
told
him
too
how
the
enchanter
was
changed
into
a
wolf
and
how
the
wolf
carried
away
sheen
s
child
and
the
unique
tale
is
in
part
your
own
history
flann
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
for
the
child
that
was
left
with
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
was
no
one
else
than
yourself
for
you
flann
have
on
your
breast
the
stars
that
denote
the
son
of
a
it
is

and
i
will

to
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
and
force
them
to
tell
you
said
the
king
s
son
i
will
do
that
said
flann
but
in
his
own
mind
he
said
i
will
first
bring
the
comb
of
magnificence
to
and
i
will
tell
her
that
i
will
have
to
be
away
for
so
many
years
with
mogue
and
i
shall
ask
her
to
remember
me
until

then
i
shall
go
to
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
and
force
them
to
tell
me
what
king
and
queen
were
my
father
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
left
flann
to
his
thoughts
and
went
to
find
the
gobaun
saor
who
would
clear
for
him
the
tarnished
blade
of
the
sword
of
light
and
would
show
him
the
way
to
where
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
had
his
dominion
mogue
spent
his
time
with
the
and
the
around
the
and
when
he
came
back
to
his
tent
he
wanted
to
drink
ale
and
go
to
sleep
but
flann
turned
him
from
the
by
saying
to
him
i
want
the
comb
of
magnificence
from
you
by
my
skin
said
mogue
it
s
my
blood

if
you
give
me
the
comb
of
magnificence
mogue
i
shall
serve
you
for
six
years
three
years
more
than
i
said
yesterday
i
shall
serve
you
well
even
though
i
am
the
son
of
a
king
and

find
out
who

father
and
mother
i
won
t
give
you
the
comb
of
i
ll
serve
you
seven
years
if
you
do
mogue
drank
and
drank
out
of
the
frowning
to
himself
he
put
the
away
and
said
i
suppose
your
life
won
t
be
any
good
to
you
unless
i
give
you
the
comb
of
magnificence
that
is
so
mogue
sighed
heavily
but
he
went
to
his
pack
and
took
out
the
box
that
the
treasures
were
in
he
let
flann
take
out
the
comb
of
magnificence
seven
years
you
will
have
to
serve
me
said
mogue
and
you
will
have
to
begin
your
service
i
will
begin
it
now
said
flann
but
he
stole
out
of
the
tent
put
on
his
red
cloak
and
went
to
the
king
s
orchard
vii
oh
flann
my
said
when
she
came
to
him
i
have
brought
you
the
comb
of
magnificence
said
he
her
hands
went
out
and
her
eyes
became
large
and
shining
he
put
the
comb
of
magnificence
into
her
hands
she
put
the
comb
into
the
back
of
her
hair
and
she
became
at
once
like
the
tower
that
is
builded
what
broke
its
height
and
turned
the
full
sunlight
from
it
has
been
taken
away
and
the
tower
stands
the
pride
of
a
king
and
the
delight
of
a
people
when
she
put
the
comb
of
magnificence
into
her
hair
she
became
of
all
kings
daughters
the
most
stately
she
walked
with
flann
along
the
paths
of
the
orchard
but
always
she
was
watching
her
shadow
to
see
if
it
showed
her
added
magnificence
her
shadow
showed
nothing
she
took
flann
to
the
well
in
the
orchard
and
looked
down
into
it
but
her
image
in
the
well
did
not
show
her
added
magnificence
either
soon
she
became
tired
of
walking
on
the
orchard
paths
and
when
she
came
to
the
gate
she
walked
no
further
but
stood
with
flann
at
the
gate
a
kiss
for
you
flann
my
said
she
and
she
kissed
him
and
then
went
hurrying
away
and
as
flann
watched
her
he
thought
that
although
she
had
kissed
him
he
was
not
now
in
her
mind
he
went
out
of
the
orchard
disconsolate
thinking
that
when
he
was
on
his
seven
years
service
with
mogue
princess
might
forget
him
as
he
walked
on
he
passed
the
little
house
where
the
had
her
besoms
and
she
ran
to
him
when
she
saw
him
have
you
heard
that
the
king
s
son
has
found
what
went
before
and
what
comes
after
the
unique
tale
said
she
that
i
have
and
i
have
to
go
to
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
to
find
out
who
my
father
and
mother
were
for
surely
i
am
the
child
who
was
taken
from
and
do
you
remember
that
sheen
s
seven
brothers
were
changed
into
seven
wild
geese
said
she
i
remember
that
and
seven
wild
geese
they
will
be
until
a
maiden
who
loves
you
will
give
seven
drops
of
her
heart
s
blood
to
bring
them
back
to
their
human
i
remember
that
whatever
maid
you
love
her
you
must
ask
if
she
would
give
seven
drops
of
her
heart
s
blood
it
may
be
that
she
would
it
may
be
that
she
would
not
and
that
you
would
still
love
her
without
thought
of
her
giving
one
drop
of
blood
of
her
little
i
can
not
ask
the
maiden
i
love
to
give
seven
drops
of
her
heart
s
who
is
the
maiden
you
love
the
king
s
daughter
he
told
the
about
the
presents
he
had
given
her
he
told
the
too
that
he
had
bound
himself
to
seven
years
service
to
mogue
on
account
of
these
presents
the
said
what
other
treasures
are
in
mogue
s
pack
one
treasure
more
the
girdle
of
truth
whoever
puts
it
on
can
speak
nothing
but
the
said
the
you
are
to
take
the
girdle
of
truth
and
give
it
to
tell
mogue
that
i
said
he
is
to
give
it
to
you
without
adding
one
day
to
your
years
service
when
has
put
the
girdle
around
her
waist
ask
her
for
the
seven
drops
of
heart
s
blood
that
will
bring
your
mother
s

shown
him
the
way
to
the

the
river
that
he
followed
takes
the
name
of
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
it
is
called
by
that
name
because
the
men
of
the
old
days
tried
to
build
towers
across
its
course
the
towers
were
built
a
little
way
across
the
river
that
at
this
place
was
tremendously
wide

glashan
will
carry
you
across
the

now
he
was
at
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
but
the
was
not
to
be
seen
then
he
saw
the
glashan
he
was
leaning
his
back
against
one
of
the
towers
and
smoking
a
short
pipe
the
water
of
the
river
was
up
to
his
knees
he
was
covered
with
hair
and
had
a
big
head
with
horse
s
ears
and
the
glashan
twitched
his
horse
s
ears
as
he
smoked
in
great
contentment

the
king
of

of
the
broken
towers
shouted
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
the
glashan
went
on
smoking
and
twisting
his
ears

the
king
of
ireland

son
might
have
known
that
the
whole
clan
of
the
gruagachs
and
glashans
are
fond
of
their
own
ease
and
will
do
nothing
if
they
can
help
it
he
twitched
his
ears
more
sharply
when
the
king
s
son
threw
a
pebble
at
him
then
after
about
three
hours
he
came
slowly
across
the
river

they
went
on
and
just
at
the
screech
of
the
day
they
came
to
the
other
shore
of
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
sprang
from
the
shoulders
of
the
glashan
and
went
into
the
mist
ii
he
came
to
where
turrets
and
pinnacles
appeared
above
the
mist
he
climbed
the
rock
upon
which
the
castle
was
built
he
came
to
the
first
gate
and
as
he
did
the
plover
that
was
on
the
third
pinnacle
above
rose
up
and
flew
round
the
castle
with
sharp
cries
he
raised
a
fragment
of
the
and
flung
it
against
the
gate
he
burst
it
open
he
dashed
in
then
and
through
the
first
courtyard
of
the
castle
as
he
went
towards
the
second
gate
it
was
flung
open
and
the
five
ran
upon
him
but
they
had
not
counted
on
what
was
to
face
them
the
sword
of
light
in
the
bands
of
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
its
stroke
cut
the
spear
heads
from
the
and
its
quick
glancing
dazzled
the
eyes
of
the
on
each
and
every
one
of
them
it
inflicted
the
wound
of
death
he
dashed
through
the
second
gate
and
into
the
third
courtyard
but
as
he
did
the
third
gate
was
flung
open
and
seven
swordsmen
came
forth
they
made
themselves
like
a
half
circle
and
came
towards
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
he
dazzled
their
eyes
with
a
wide
sweep
of
his
sword
he
darted
it
swiftly
at
each
of
them
and
on
the
seven
swordsmen
too
he
inflicted
wounds
of
death
he
went
through
the
third
courtyard
and
towards
the
fourth
gate
as
he
did
it
opened
slowly
and
a
single
champion
came
forth
he
closed
the
gate
behind
him
and
stood
with
a
long
gray
sword
in
his
hand
this
was
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
his
shoulders
were
where
a
tall
man
s
head
would
be
his
face
was
like
a
stone
and
his
eyes
had
never
looked
except
with
scorn
upon
a
foe
when
his
enemy
began
his
attack
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
had
power
to
do
nothing
else
but
guard
himself
from
that
weighty
sword
he
had
the
sword
of
light
for
a
guard
and
well
did
that
bright
swift
blade
guard
him
the
two
fought
across
the
courtyard
making
hard
places
soft
and
soft
places
hard
with
their
trampling
they
fought
from
when
it
was
early
to
when
it
was
noon
and
they
fought
from
when
it
was
noon
until
it
was
long
afternoon
and
not
a
single
wound
did
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
inflict
upon
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
and
not
a
single
wound
did
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
inflict
upon
him
but
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
was
growing
faint
and
weary
his
eyes
were
worn
with
watching
the
strokes
and
thrusts
of
the
sword
that
was
battling
against
him
his
arms
could
hardly
bear
up
his
own
sword
his
heart
became
a
stream
of
blood
that
would
have
gushed
from
his
breast
and
then
as
he
was
about
to
fall
down
with
his
head
under
the
sword
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
a
name
rose
above
all
his
thoughts
if
he
sank
down
and
the
sword
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
fell
on
him
never
would
she
be
saved
the
will
became
strong
again
in
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
his
heart
became
a
steady
beating
thing
the
weight
that
was
upon
his
arms
passed
away
strongly
he
held
the
sword
in
his
hand
and
he
began
to
attack
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
and
now
he
saw
that
the
sword
in
the
hand
of
his
enemy
was
broken
and
worn
with
the
guard
that
the
sword
of
light
had
put
against
it
and
now
he
made
a
strong
attack
as
the
light
was
leaving
the
sky
and
as
the
darkness
was
coming
down
he
saw
that
the
strength
was
waning
in
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
the
sword
in
his
hand
was
more
worn
and
more
broken
at
last
the
blade
was
only
a
span
from
the
hilt
as
he
drew
back
to
the
gate
of
the
fourth
courtyard
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
sprang
at
him
and
thrust
the
sword
of
light
through
his
breast
he
stood
with
his
face
becoming
exceedingly
terrible
he
flung
what
remained
of
his
sword
and
the
broken
blade
struck
the
foot
of
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
pierced
it
then
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
fell
down
on
the
ground
before
the
fourth
gate
so
weary
from
his
battles
so
pained
with
the
wound
of
his
foot
was
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
that
he
did
not
try
to
cross
the
body
and
go
towards
the
fifth
gate
he
turned
back
he
climbed
down
the
rock
and
went
towards
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
the
glashan
was
broiling
on
a
hot
stone

eel
he
had
taken
out
of
the

my
wound

the
king
of

portion
of
the

said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
there
is
no
one
to
guard
the
gates
now
but
the
hag
you
spoke
of
i
shall
take
fedelma
out
of
her
captivity
and
we
will
both
leave
the
land
of
mist
but
i
must
sleep
he
laid
the
sword
of
light
beside
him
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
and
went
to
sleep
the
glashan
drew
his
horse
s
legs
under
him
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
ear
and
smoked
all
through
the
night
iii
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
rose
in
the
morning
but
he
was
in
pain
and
weariness
on
account
of
his
wounded
foot
he
ate
the
cresses
and
drank
the
water
that
the
glashan
gave
him
and
he
started
off
for
the
castle
of
the
king
of
the
mist
tis
only
an
old
woman
i
shall
have
to
deal
with
he
said
and
then
i
shall
awaken
fedelma
my
he
passed
through
the
first
gate
and
the
first
through
the
second
gate
and
the
second
through
the
third
gate
and
the
third
courtyard
the
fourth
gate
was
closed
and
as
he
went
towards
it
it
opened
slowly
and
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
stood
there
as
high
as
and
as
scornful
as
before
and
in
his
hand
he
had
a
weighty
gray
sword
they
fought
as
they
fought
the
day
before
but
the
guard
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
made
against
the
sword
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
was
weaker
than
before
because
of
the
pain
and
weariness
that
came
from
his
wound
but
still
he
kept
the
sword
of
light
before
him
and
the
sword
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
could
not
pass
it
they
fought
until
it
was
afternoon
the
heart
in
his
body
seemed
turned
to
a
jet
of
blood
that
would
gush
forth
his
eyes
were
straining
themselves
out
of
their
sockets
his
arms
could
hardly
bear
up
his
sword
he
fell
down
upon
one
knee
but
he
was
able
to
hold
the
sword
so
that
it
guarded
his
head
then
the
image
of
fedelma
appeared
before
him
he
sprang
up
and
his
arms
regained
their
power
his
heart
became
steady
in
his
breast
and
as
he
made
an
attack
upon
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
he
saw
that
the
blade
in
his
hand
was
broken
and
worn
because
of
its
strokes
against
the
sword
of
light
they
fought
with
blades
that
seemed
to
kindle
each
other
into
sparks
and
flashes
of
light
they
fought
until
the
blade
in
the
hand
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
was
worn
to
a
hand
breadth
above
the
hilt
he
drew
back
towards
the
gate
of
the
fifth
courtyard
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
sprang
at
him
and
thrust
the
sword
of
light
through
his
breast
down
on
the
stones
before
the
fifth
gate
of
his
castle
fell
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
stepped
over
the
body
and
went
towards
the
fifth
gate
then
he
remembered
what
the
glashan
had
said
his
life
is
in
his
he
went
back
to
where
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
had
fallen
with
a
clean
sweep
of
his
sword
he
cut
the
head
off
the
body
then
out
of
the
mist
that
was
all
around
three
ravens
came
with
beak
and
claws
they
laid
hold
of
the
head
and
lifted
it
up
they
fluttered
heavily
away
keeping
near
the
ground
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
chased
the
ravens
he
followed
them
through
the
fourth
courtyard
the
third
courtyard
the
second
and
the
first
they
flew
off
the
rock
on
which
the
castle
was
built
and
disappeared
in
the
mist
he
knew
he
would
have
to
watch
by
the
body
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
so
that
the
head
might
not
be
placed
upon
it
he
sat
down
before
the
fifth
gate
pain
and
weariness
hunger
and
thirst
oppressed
him
he
longed
for
something
that
would
allay
his
hunger
and
thirst
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
go
to
the
river
to
get
refreshment
of
water
and
cresses
from
the
glashan
something
fell
beside
him
in
the
courtyard
it
was
a
beautiful
apple
he
went
to
pick
it
up
but
it
rolled
away
towards
the
third
courtyard
he
followed
it
then
as
he
looked
back
he
saw
that
the
ravens
had
lighted
near
the
body
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
holding
the
head
in
their
beaks
and
claws
he
ran
back
and
the
ravens
lifted
the
head
up
again
and
flew
away
he
watched
for
another
long
time
and
his
hunger
and
his
thirst
made
him
long
for
the
apple
he
had
seen
another
apple
fell
down
he
went
to
pick
it
up
and
it
rolled
away
but
now
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
thought
of
nothing
hut
that
apple
he
followed
it
as
it
rolled
it
roiled
through
the
third
courtyard
and
the
second
and
the
first
it
rolled
out
of
the
first
gate
and
on
to
the
rock
upon
which
the
castle
was
built
it
rolled
off
the
rock
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
sprang
down
and
he
saw
the
apple
become
a
raven
s
head
and
beak
he
climbed
up
the
rock
and
ran
back
and
when
he
came
into
the
first
courtyard
he
saw
that
the
three
ravens
had
come
back
again
they
had
brought
the
head
to
the
body
and
body
and
head
were
now
joined
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
stood
up
again
and
his
head
was
turned
towards
his
left
shoulder
he
went
to
the
sixth
gate
and
took
up
a
sword
that
was
beside
it
iv
they
fought
their
last
battle
before
the
sixth
gate
the
guard
that
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
made
was
weak
and
if
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
could
have
turned
fully
upon
him
he
could
have
disarmed
and
killed
him
but
his
head
had
been
so
placed
upon
his
body
that
it
looked
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
over
his
left
shoulder
he
was
able
to
draw
his
sword
down
the
breast
of
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
wounding
him
the
king
s
son
whirled
his
sword
around
his
head
and
flung
it
at
his
enemy
it
swept
his
head
off
and
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
fell
down
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
saw
on
the
outstretched
neck
the
mark
of
the
other
beheading
he
took
up
the
sword
of
light
again
and
prepared
to
hold
the
head
against
all
that
might
come
for
it
but
no
creature
came
and
then
the
hair
on
the
severed
head
became
loose
and
it
was
blown
away
by
the
wind
and
the
bones
of
the
head
became
a
powder
and
the
flesh
became
a
froth
and
all
was
blown
away
by
the
wind
then
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
went
through
the
sixth
courtyard
and
came
to
the
seventh
gate
and
before
it
he
saw
the
last
of
the
sentinels
a
hag
she
was
seated
on
the
top
of
a
taking
white
doves
out
of
a
basket
and
throwing
them
to
ravens
that
flew
down
from
the
walls
and
tore
the
doves
to
pieces
when
the
hag
saw
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
she
sprang
down
from
the
and
ran
towards
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
long
poisoned
nails
with
a
sweep
of
his
sword
he
cut
the
nails
from
her
hands
ravens
picked
up
the
nails
and
then
as
they
tried
to
fly
away
they
fell
dead
the
sword
of
light
will
take
off
your
head
if
you
do
not
take
me
on
the
moment
to
where
fedelma
is
said
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
i
am
sorry
to
do
it
said
the
hag
but
come
since
you
are
the
he
followed
the
hag
into
the
castle
in
a
net
hanging
across
a
chamber
he
saw
fedelma
she
was
still
but
she
breathed
and
the
branch
of
hawthorn
that
put
her
asleep
was
fresh
beside
her
strands
of
her
bright
hair
came
through
the
meshes
of
the
net
and
were
fastened
to
the
wall
with
a
sweep
of
the
sword
of
light
he
cut
the
strands
her
eyes
opened
she
saw
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
the
full
light
came
back
to
her
eyes
and
the
full
life
into
her
face
he
cut
the
net
from
where
it
hung
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
he
cut
open
the
meshes
fedelma
rose
out
of
it
and
went
into
his
arms
he
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
out
into
the
seventh
courtyard
then
the
hag
who
had
been
one
of
the
sentinels
came
out
of
the
castle
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
ran
away
into
the
mist
three
ravens
flying
after
her
and
as
for
fedelma
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
they
went
through
the
courtyards
of
the
castle
and
through
the
mists
of
the
country
and
down
to
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
they
found
the
glashan
broiling
a
salmon
upon
hot
stones
salmon
were
coming
from
the
sea
and
the
glashan
went
in
and
caught
more
the
king
of
the
land
of
mist
broiled
and
gave
them
to
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
fedelma
to
eat
the
little
black
came
out
of
the
river
and
they
fed
it
the
next
day
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
bade
the
glashan
take
fedelma
on
his
shoulders
and
carry
her
to
the
other
shore
of
the
river
of
the
broken
towers
and
he
himself
followed
the
little
black
who
showed
him
all
the
shallow
places
in
the
river
so
that
he
crossed
with
the
water
never
above
his
waist
but
he
was
nearly
dead
from
cold
and
weariness
and
from
the
wounds
on
breast
and
foot
when
he
came
to
the
other
side
and
found
the
glashan
and
fedelma
waiting
for
him
they
ate
salmon
again
and
rested
for
a
day
they
bade
to
the
glashan
who
went
back
to
the
river
to
hunt
for
salmon
then
they
went
along
the
bank
of
the
river
hand
in
hand
while
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
told
fedelma
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
to
him
in
his
search
for
her
they
came
to
where
the
river
became
known
as
the
river
of
the
morning
star
and
then
in
the
distance
they
saw
the
hill
of
horns
towards
the
hill
of
horns
they
went
and
at
the
near
side
of
it
they
found
a
house
thatched
with
the
wing
of
a
bird
it
was
the
house
of
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
to
the
house
of
the
little
sage
of
the
mountain
fedelma
and
the
king
s
son
now
went
to
the
memory
of
beatrice
cassidy
colum
the
house
of
crom
duv
i
the
story
is
now
about
flann
he
went
through
the
east
gate
of
the
town
of
the
red
castle
and
his
journey
was
to
the
house
of
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
where
he
might
learn
what
queen
and
king
were
his
mother
and
his
father
it
is
with
the
youth
flann
once
called
the
gilly
of
the
goatskin
that
we
will
go
if
it
be
pleasing
to
you
son
of
my
heart
he
went
his
way
in
the
evening
when
as
the
bard
said
the
blackbird
shakes
his
metal
notes
against
the
edge
of
day
and
i
am
left
upon
my
road
with
one
star
on
my
way
and
he
went
his
way
in
the
night
when
as
the
same
bard
said
the
night
has
told
it
to
the
hills
and
told
the
partridge
in
the
nest
and
left
it
on
the
long
white
roads
she
will
give
light
instead
of
rest
and
he
went
on
between
the
dusk
and
the
dawn
when
as
the
same
bard
said
again
behold
the
sky
is
covered
as
with
a
mighty
shroud
a
forlorn
light
is
lying
between
the
earth
and
cloud
and
he
went
on
in
the
dawn
when
as
the
bard
said
and
this
is
the
last
stanza
he
made
for
the
king
said
there
was
nothing
at
all
in
his
adventure
in
the
silence
of
the
morning
myself
myself
went
by
where
lonely
trees
sway
branches
against
spaces
of
the
sky
and
then
when
the
sun
was
looking
over
the
first
high
hills
he
came
to
a
river
he
knew
it
was
the
river
he
followed
before
for
no
other
river
in
the
country
was
so
wide
or
held
so
much
water
as
he
had
gone
with
the
flow
of
the
river
then
he
thought
he
would
go
against
the
flow
of
the
river
now
and
so
he
might
come
back
to
the
glens
and
ridges
and
deep
boggy
places
he
had
traveled
from
he
met
a
fisherman
who
was
drying
his
nets
and
he
asked
him
what
name
the
river
had
the
fisherman
said
it
had
two
names
the
people
on
the
right
bank
called
it
the
river
and
the
people
on
the
left
bank
called
it
the
river
of
the
morning
star
and
the
fisherman
told
him
he
was
to
be
careful
not
to
call
it
the
river
of
the
morning
star
when
he
was
on
the
right
bank
nor
the
daybreak
river
when
he
was
on
the
left
as
the
people
on
either
side
wanted
to
keep
to
the
name
their
fathers
had
for
it
and
were
to
the
stranger
who
gave
it
a
different
name
the
fisherman
told
flann
he
was
sorry
he
had
told
him
the
two
names
for
the
river
and
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
forget
one
of
the
names
and
call
it
just
the
river
of
the
morning
star
as
he
was
on
the
left
bank
flann
went
on
with
the
day
widening
before
him
and
when
the
height
of
the
noon
was
past
he
came
to
the
glens
and
ridges
and
deep
boggy
places
he
had
traveled
from
he
went
on
with
the
bright
day
going
before
him
and
the
brown
night
coming
behind
him
and
at
dusk
he
came
to
the
black
and
burnt
place
where
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
had
their
house
of
stone
he
saw
the
house
with
a
puff
of
smoke
coming
through
every
crevice
in
the
stones
he
went
to
the
shut
door
and
knocked
on
it
with
the
who
s
without
said
one
of
the
hags
who
s
within
said
flann
the
three
hags
of
the
long
teeth
said
one
of
the
hags
and
if
you
want
to
know
it
said
she
they
are
the
runners
and
summoners
the
brewers
and
for
crom
duv
the
flann
struck
a
heavier
blow
with
the
and
the
door
broke
in
he
stepped
into
the
house
no
welcome
to
you
whoever
you
are
said
one
of
the
three
hags
who
were
seated
around
the
fire
i
am
the
lad
who
was
called
gilly
of
the
goatskin
and
whom
you
reared
up
here
said
he
and
i
have
come
back
to
the
three
hags
turned
from
the
fire
then
and
screamed
at
him
and
what
brought
you
back
to
us
humpy
fellow
said
the
first
hag
i
came
back
to
make
you
tell
me
what
queen
and
king
were
my
mother
and
why
should
you
think
a
king
and
queen
were
your
father
and
mother
they
said
to
him
because
i
have
on
my
breast
the
stars
of
a
son
of
a
king
said
flann
and
said
he
i
have
in
my
hand
a
sword
that
will
make
you
tell
he
came
towards
them
and
they
were
afraid
then
the
first
hag
bent
her
knee
to
him
and
said
she
loosen
the
hearthstone
with
your
sword
and
you
will
find
a
token
that
will
let
you
know
who
your
father
flann
put
his
sword
under
the
hearthstone
and
pried
it
up
but
if
it
were
a
token
what
was
under
the
hearthstone
was
an
evil
thing
a
cockatrice
it
had
been
hatched
out
of
a
serpent
s
egg
by
a
black
cock
of
nine
years
it
had
the
head
and
crest
of
a
cock
and
the
body
of
a
black
serpent
the
cockatrice
lifted
itself
up
on
its
tail
and
looked
at
him
with
red
eyes
the
sight
of
that
head
made
flann
dizzy
and
he
fell
down
on
the
floor
then
it
went
down
and
the
hags
put
the
hearthstone
above
it
what
will
we
do
with

said
one
of
the
hags
looking
at

who
was
in
a

on

cut
of
his
head
with

hag
crom

what
he
has
promised

for
so
long
a
berry
to
each
of
us
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
that

be
said
the
other
hags
they
put
green
branches
on
the
fire
so
that
crom
duv
would
see
the
smoke
and
come
to
the
house
in
the
morning
he
came
he
brought
flann
outside
and
after
awhile
flann
s
senses
came
back
to
him
then
the
giant
tied
a
rope
round
his
arms
and
drove
him
before
him
with
a
long
iron
spike
that
he
had
for
a
staff
ii
crom
duv
s
arms
stretched
down
to

was
as
high
as
a
haystack
he
carried
in
his
twisted
hand
an
iron
spike
pointed
at
the
end
and
wherever
he
was
going
he
went
as
quickly
as
a
running
mule
he
tied
flann
s
hands
behind
his
back
and
drew
the
rope
round
flann
s
body
then
he
started
off
flann
was
dragged
on
as
if
at
the
tail
of
a
cart
over
ditches
and
through
streams
up
hillsides
and
down
into
hollows
he
was
hauled
then
they
came
into
a
plain
as
round
as
the
wheel
of
a
cart
across
the
plain
they
went
and
into
a
wood
beyond
the
wood
there
were
buildings
such
walls
and
such
heaps
of
stones
flann
never
saw
before
but
before
they
had
entered
the
wood
they
had
come
to
a
high
grassy
mound
and
standing
on
that
grassy
mound
was
the
most
tremendous

and
the

stood
still
with
his
tremendous
head

lapped
up
great
crocks
of
milk
morag
s
little
red
hen
went
hopping
round
the
courtyard
she
seemed
to
be
sleepy
or
to
be
always
considering
something
if
one
of
the
yellow
cats
looked
at
her
the
little
red
hen
would
waken
up
murmur
something
and
hop

without
crom

he
has
gone
on

morag
if
you

by
the
front
the
bull
of
the
mound
will
toss
you
in
the
air
and
then
trample
you
into
the
but
i
have
strength
and
cunning
and
activity
enough
to
climb
the
wall
at
the
but
if
you
climb
the
wall
at
the
back
said
morag
you
will
only
come
to
the
moat
of
poisoned
the
moat
of
poisoned
water
the
moat
of
poisoned
water
said
morag
the
water
poisons
the
skin
of
any
creature
that
tries
to
swim
across
the
flann
was
downcast
when
he
heard
of
the
moat
of
poisoned
water
but
his
mind
was
fixed
on
climbing
the
wall
i
may
find
some
way
of
crossing
the
poisoned
water
he
said
so
bake
my
cake
and
give
me
provision
for
my
morag
baked
a
cake
and
put
it
on
the
griddle
and
when
it
was
baked
she
wrapped
it
in
a
napkin
and
gave
it
to
him

my
blessing
with
it
said
she
and
if
you
escape
may
you
meet
someone
who
will
be
a
better
help
to
you
than
i
was
i
must
keep
the
cats
from
watching
you
while
you
are
climbing
the
and
how
will
you
do
that
said
flann
she
showed
him
what
she
would
do
with
a
piece
of
glass
she
made
on
the
wall
of
the
byre
the
shadows
of
flying
birds
birds
never
flew
across
the
house
of
crom
duv
and
the
cats
were
greatly
taken
with
the
appearances
that
morag
made
with
the
piece
of
glass
six
cats
watched
and
then
another
six
came
and
after
them
six
more
and
after
them
the
six
that
watched
in
the
rowan
tree
and
the
yellow
cats
sat
round
and
watched
with
burning
eyes
the
appearances
of
birds
that
morag
made
on
the
flann
looked
back
and
saw
her
seated
on
a
stone
and
he
thought
the
looked
lonesome
he
tried
with
all
his
activity
all
his
cunning
and
all
his
strength
and
at
last
he
climbed
the
wall
at
the
back
of
crom
duv
s
house
he
gave
a
whistle
to
let
morag
know
he
was
over
then
he
went
through
a
little
wood
and
came
to
the
moat
of
poisoned
water
very
ugly
the
dead
water
looked
ugly
stakes
stuck
up
from
the
mud
to
pierce
any
creature
that
tried
to
leap
across
and
here
and
there
on
the
water
were
patches
of
green
poison
as
big
as
cabbage
leaves
flann
drew
back
from
the
moat
leap
it
he
could
not
and
swim
it
he
dare
not
and
just
as
he
drew
back
he
saw
a
creature
he
knew
come
down
to
the
bank
opposite
to
him
it
was
rory
the
fox
rory
carried
in
his
mouth
the
skin
of
a
calf
he
dropped
the
skin
into
the
water
and
pushed
it
out
before
him
then
he
got
into
the
water
and
swam
very
cautiously
always
pushing
the
calf
s
skin
before
him
then
rory
climbed
up
on
the
bank
where
flann
was
and
the
skin
all
green
and
wrinkled
sank
down
into
the
water
rory
was
going
to
turn
tail
but
then
he
recognized
flann
master
said
he
and
he
licked
the
dust
on
the
ground
what
are
you
doing
here
rory
said
flann
i
won
t
mind
telling
you
if
you
promise
to
tell
no
other
creature
said
rory
i
won
t
tell
said
flann
well
then
said
rory
i
have
moved
my
little
family
over
here
i
was
being
chased
about
a
good
deal
and
my
little
family
wasn
t
safe
so
i
moved
them
over
the
fox
turned
and
looked
round
at
the
country
behind
him
it
suits
me
very
well
said
he
no
creature
would
think
of
crossing
this
moat
after
well
said
flann
tell
me
how
you
are
able
to
cross
i
will
said
the
fox
if
you
promise
never
to
hunt
me
nor
any
of
my
little
i
promise
said
flann
well
said
rory
the
water
poisons
every
skin
now
the
reason
that
i
pushed
the
calf
s
skin
across
was
that
it
might
take
the
poison
out
of
the
water
the
water
poisons
every
skin
but
where
the
skin
goes
the
poison
is
taken
out
of
the
water
for
a
while
and
a
living
creature
can
cross
behind
it
if
he
is
i
thank
you
for
showing
me
the
way
to
cross
the
moat
said
flann
i
don
t
mind
showing
you
said
rory
the
fox
and
he
went
off
to
his
burrow
there
were
and
both
sides
of
the
moat
flann
took
a
calf
s
skin
he
pushed
it
into
the
water
with
a
stick
he
swam
cautiously
behind
it
when
he
reached
the
other
side
of
the
moat
the
skin
all
green
and
wrinkled
sank
in
the
water
flann
jumped
and
laughed
and
shouted
when
he
found
himself
in
the
forest
and
clear
of
crom
duv
s
house
he
went
on
it
was
grand
to
see
the
woodpecker
hammering
on
the
branch
and
to
see
him
stop
busy
as
he
was
to
say
pass
two
young
deer
came
out
of
the
depths
of
the
wood
they
were
too
young
and
too
innocent
to
have
anything
to
tell
him
but
they
bounded
alongside
of
him
as
he
raced
along
the
hunter
s
path
he
jumped
and
he
shouted
again
when
he
saw
the
river
before
him
the
river
that
was
called
the
daybreak
river
on
the
right
bank
and
the
river
of
the
morning
star
on
the
left
he
said
to
himself
this
time
in
troth
i
will
go
the
whole
way
with
the
river
a
moving
thing
is
my
delight
the
river
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
things
i
have
seen
on
my
then
he
thought
he
would
eat
some
of
the
cake
that
morag
had
baked
for
him
he
sat
down
and
broke
it
then
as
he
ate
it
the
thought
of
morag
came
into
his
mind
he
thought
he
was
looking
at
her
putting
the
cake
on
the
griddle
he
went
a
little
way
along
the
river
and
then
he
began
to
feel
lonesome
he
turned
back
i
ll
go
to
crom
duv
s
house

wanted
to
think
of
what
we
could

asked
baun
to

to
me
she
said
she
would
if
i
washed
her
feet

got
a
basin
of
water
and
washed
baun
s
feet
and
while
she
sang
and
while
the
hags
thought
we
were
not
minding
them
i
considered
what
we
might
do
to
escape
the
hags
hung
a
pot
over
the
fire
and
the
three
of
them
sat
around
it
once
more
when
i
had
washed
my
s
feet
i
took
a
besom
and
began
to
sweep
the
floor
of
the
house
one
of
the
hags
was
very
pleased
to
see
me
doing
that
she
said
i
would
make
a
good
servant
and
after
a
while
she
asked
me
to

at
the
fire

sat
in
the
corner
of
the
chimney
they
had
put
meal
in

i
began
to
stir
it
with
a
then
the
hag
that
had
asked
me
to
the
fire
said
i
will
give
you
a
good
share
of
milk

the
pot
for
this
was
just
what
i
wanted
to

and

i
got
a
dish
and
ladle
and
took
out
of
the
pot
some
porridge
this
i
left

side
then
i
took
down
the
that

on
the
and
mixed
handfuls
of
salt
in
the
porridge

in
the
pot
when
it
was
all
cooked
i
emptied
it
into
another
dish
and
brought
the
two
dishes
to
the
table
then
i
told
the
hags
that

over
to
the
table
and
they
gave
my
and
myself

depths
of
the
sea
said
another
of
the
hags
my
respects
to
you
ma
am
said
baun
but
i
do
not
taste
any
salt
on
it
at
my
were
so
earnest
that
the
hags
thought
themselves
mistaken
and
they
ate
the
whole
dishful
of
porridge
the
bed
was
made
for
us
and
the
pillows
were
laid
on
the
bed
and
i
knew
that
the
was
in
each
of
the
pillows
i
wanted
to
put
off
the
time
for
going
to

so
i
began
to
tell
stories
baun
and
deelish
said
it
was
still
young
in
the
night
and
that
i
should
tell
no
short
ones
but
the
long
story
of
eithne
balor

just
begun
that
story
when

of
the
hags
cried
out
that
she
was
consumed
with
thirst
she
ran
to
the
pitcher
and
there
was
no
water
in
it
then
another
hag
shouted
out
that
the
thirst
was
strangling
her
the
third
one
said
she
could
not
live
another
minute
without
a
mouthful
of
water
she
took
the
pitcher
and
started
for
the
well
no
sooner
was
she
gone
than
the
second
hag
said
she
couldn
t
wait
for
the
first
one
to
come
back
and
she
started
out
after
her
then
the
third
one
thought
that
the
pair
would
stay
too
long
talking
at
the
well
and
she
started
after
them
immediately
i
took
the
pillows
off
our
bed
and
put
them
on
the
hags
bed
taking
their
pillows
instead
the
hags
came
back
with
a
pitcher
and
they
ordered
us
to
go
to
our
bed

went
and
they
sat
for
a
while
drinking
porringers
of
water

be
here
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
heard
one
of
them
say

their
heads
on
the
pillows
and
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
they
were
asleep
i
told
my
then
what
i
had
done
and
why
i
had
done
it
they
were
very
frightened
but
seeing
the
hags
so
sound
asleep
they
composed
themselves
and
slept
too
before
the
screech
of
day
crom
duv
came
to
the
house
i
went
outside
and
saw
the
giant

said
i
was
the
servant
of
the
hags
and
that
they
were
sleeping
still
he
said
they
are
my
runners
and
summoners
my
brewers
bakers
and
and
they
have
no
right
to
be
sleeping
so
then
he
went
away
i
knew
that
the
three
hags
would
slumber
until
we
took
the
pillows
from
under
their
heads
we
left
them
sleeping
while
we
put
down
a
fire
and

up
then
but
we
were
out
on

the
first
three
steps

were
not
long
at
the
court
of

my

fell
so
deeply
in
love
with
the
two
youths
that
every
night
the
pillow
on
each
side
of
me
was
wet
with
their
tears
i
went
to
work
in
the
king
s
kitchen
now
the
king
had
a
dish
of
such
fine
earthware
and
with
such
beautiful
patterns
upon
it
that
he
never
let
it
be
carried
from
the
kitchen
to
the
nor
from
the
to
the
kitchen
without
going
himself
behind
the
servant
who
carried
it

day
the
servant
brought
it
into
the
kitchen
to
be
washed
and
the
king
came
behind
the
servant
i
took
the
dish
and
cleaned
it
with
water
and
dried
it
with
cloths
of
three
different
kinds
then
i
covered
it
with
herbs
and
left
it
in
a
bin
where
it
was
sunk
in
soft
bran
the
king
was
pleased
to
see
the
good
care
i
took
of
his
dish
and
he
said
before
his
servant
that
he
would
do
me
any
favor
i
would
ask
there
and
then
i
told
him
about
my
two
baun
and
deelish
and
how
they
were
in
love
with
the
two
youths
dermott
and
downal

of
ireland
i
asked
that
when
these
two
youths
were
being
given
wives
that
the
king
should
remember
my
the
king
was
greatly
vexed
at
my
request
he
declared
that
the
two
youths
had
on
their
breasts
the
stars
that
denoted
the
sons
of
kings
and
that
he
intended
they
should
marry
his
own
two
when
the
maidens
were
of
age
to
it
may
be
he
said
that
these
two
youths
will
bring
what
my
queen
longs
for
a
berry
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
that
is
guarded

the
giant
crom
duv
guarded
and
why
it
was
that

what
mananaun
had
brought
from

a
branch
of
rowan
berries

berries
were
to
be
eaten
by
the
players
mananaun
said
and
not
one
of
them
was
to
be
taken
into
the
world
of
the
mortals
or
the
world
of
the
fairies
when
they
stopped
playing
at
the
high
tide
of

the
mortal
fergus
saw
aine
and
saw
her
for
the
first
time

spirit
that
he
had
never

into
him
at
the
sight
of
mananaun

the
berry
he
was
given

it
the
double
stroke
first
with
the
handle
and
then
with
the
weighted
end
of
the
hurl
and
drove
it
beautifully
as
a
flying
bird
between
the
that
mananaun
had
set
up
the
match
was
won
by
the
goal
that
fergus
had
gained
the
fianna
then
invited
the
fairies
of
munster
to
a
feast
that
they
were
giving
to
fergus
and
his
bride
the
fairies
went
and
mananaun
and
aine
went
before
them
all
fergus
marched
at
the
head
of
his
troop
with
the
rowan
berry
still
hanging
from
his
mouth
and
as
he
went
he
bit
the
stalk
and
the
berry
fell
to
the
ground
fergus
never
heeded
that
when
the
feast
was
over
he
went
to
where
mananaun
stood
with
his
daughter
aine
gave
him
her
hand
and
it
is
well
said
conan
the
fool
of
the
fianna
that
this
fergus
has
at
last
dropped
the
berry
out
of
his
what
berry
said
curoi
who
was
standing
by
the
rowan
berry
said
conan
that
he
carried
across
two
townlands
the
same
as
if
he
were
a
when
mananaun
heard
this
he
asked
about
the
berry
that
fergus
had
carried
it
was
not
to
be
found
then
the
fianna
and
the
fairies
of
munster
started
back
to
look
for
a
trace
of
it
what
they
found
was
a
wonderful
rowan
tree
it
had
grown
out
of
the
berry
that
fergus
had
let
fall
but
as
yet
there
were
no
berries
on
its
branches
mananaun
when
he
saw
the
tree
said
no
mortal
may
take
a
berry
that
grows
on
it
hear
my
sentence
now
fergus
will
have
to
guard
this
tree
until
he
gets
one
who
will
guard
it
for
him
and
he
may
not
see
nor
keep
company
with
aine
his
bride
until
he
finds
one
who
will
guard
it
better
than
he
can
guard
it
then
mananaun
wrapped
his
daughter
in
his
cloak
and
strode
away
in
a
mist
the
fairy
host
went
in
one
direction
and
the
fianna
in
another
and
fergus
was
left
standing
sorrowfully
by
the
fairy
rowan
tree
next
day
said
morag
when
the
king
s
councillor
was
feeding
the
birds
and
i
was
sifting
the
corn
he
told
me
the
rest
of
the
history
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
fergus
thought
and
thought
how
he
might
leave
off
watching
it
and
be
with
aine
his
bride
at
last
he
bethought
him
of
a
giant
who
lived
on
a
rocky
island
with
only
a
flock
of
goats
for
his
possessions
this
giant
had
begged
finn
the
chief
of
the
fianna
for
a
strip
of
the
land
of
ireland
even
if
it
were
only
the
breadth
of
a
bull
s
hide
finn
had
refused
him
but
now
fergus
sent
to
finn
and
asked
him
to
bring
the
giant
to
be
the
guardian
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
and
to
give
him
the
land
around
it
i
mislike
letting
this
giant
crom
duv
have
any
portion
of
the
land
of
ireland
said
finn
nevertheless
we
can
not
refuse
so
finn
sent
some
of
the
fianna
to
the
giant
and
they
found
him
living
on
a
bare
rock
of
an
island
with
only
a
flock
of
goats
for
his
possessions
crom
duv
lay
on
his
back
and
laughed
when
he
heard
what
message
the
men
of
the
fianna
brought
to
him
then
he
put
them
and
his
flock
of
goats
into
his
big
boat
and
rowed
them
over
to
ireland
crom
duv
swore
by
his
flock
of
goats
he
would
guard
the
fairy
rowan
tree
until
the
red
berries
ceased
to
come
on
its
branches
fergus
left
his
place
at
the
tree
then
and
went
to
aine
and
it
may
be
that
she
and
he
are
still
together
well
did
crom
duv
guard
the
tree
never
going
far
from
it
and
sleeping
at
night
in
its
branches
and
one
year
a
heifer
came
and
fed
with
his
flock
of
goats
and
another
year
a
bullock
came
and
these
were
the
beginning
of
his
great
herd
of
cattle
he
has
become
more
and
more
greedy
for
cattle
said
the
king
s
councillor
and
now
he
takes
them
away
to
far
pastures
but
still
the
fairy
rowan
tree
is
well
guarded
the
bull
that
is
called
the
bull
of
the
mound
is
on
guard
near
by
and
fierce
yellow
cats
watch
the
tree
night
and
day
the
queen
of
senlabor
and
many
another
woman
besides
desires
a
berry
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
that
stands
in
crom
duv
s
courtyard
for
the
woman
who
is
old
and
who
eats
a
berry
from
that
tree
becomes
young
again
and
the
maid
who
is
young
and
who
eats
a
berry
gets
all
the
beauty
that
should
be
hers
of
right
and
now
my
maid
said
the
king
s
councillor
to
me
i
have
told
you
the
history
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
when
i
heard
all
this
said
morag
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
a
berry
for
the
queen
and
maybe
another
berry
besides
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
in
crom
duv
s
courtyard
when
the
king
came
into
the
kitchen
again
i
asked
him
would
he
permit
my
to
marry
downal
and
dermott
if
i
brought
to
his
queen
a
berry
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
he
said
he
would
give
permission
heartily
that
night
when
i
felt
the
tears
of
baun
and
deelish
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
search
for
such
a
dowry
for
them
that
when
they
had
it
the
king
would
let
them
marry
the
youths
they
had
set
their
hearts
on
they
did
not
believe
i
could
do
anything
to
help
them
but
they
gave
me
leave
to
go
the
next
day
i
told
the
queen
i
was
going
to
seek
for
a
berry
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
she
told
me
that
if
i
could
bring
back
one
berry
to
her
she
would
give
me
all
the
things
she
possessed
i
said
to
my
and
with
the
little
red
hen
under
my
arm
i
went
towards
the
house
of
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
i
built
a
shelter
and
waited
till
crom
duv
came
that
way
one
early
morning
he
came
by
i
stood
before
him
and
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
to
take
service
in
his
house
crom
duv
had
never
had
a
servant
in
his
house
but
i
told
him
that
he
should
have
a
and
that
i
was
well
fitted
to
look
after
his
cattle
he
told
me
to
follow
him
i
saw
the
bull
of
the
mound
and
i
was
made
wonder
how
i
could
get
away
with
the
berry
from
the
fairy
rowan
tree
then
i
saw
the
fierce
yellow
cats
and
i
was
made
wonder
how
i
could
get
the
berry
from
the
tree
and
after
that
i
found
out
about
the
moat
of
poisoned
water
that
is
behind
the
high
wall
at
the
back
of
crom
duv
s
house
and
so
now
said
morag
you
know
why
i
have
come
here
and
how
hard
the
task
is
i
have
taken
on
myself
vi
now
that
he
had
heard
the
history
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
flann
often
looked
at
the
clusters
of
scarlet
berries
that
were
high
up
on
its
branches
the
tree
could
be
climbed
flann
knew
but
on
the
top
of
the
tree
and
along
its
branches
were
the
fierce
yellow
cats
the
cats
that
the
hags
of
the
long
teeth
had
reared
for
crom
duv
thinking
that
he
would
some
time
give
each
of
them
the
berry
that
would
make
them
young
again
and
at
the
butt
of
the
tree
there
were
more
cats
and
all
about
the
courtyard
the
hags
fierce
cats
paraded
themselves
the
walls
round
the
giant
s
keep
were
being
built
higher
by
crom
duv
helped
by
his
servant
flann
the
giant
s
herd
was
now
increased
by
many
calves
and
morag
the
had
much
to
do
to
keep
all
the
cows
milked
and
day
and
night
morag
and
flann
heard
the
bellowing
of
the
bull
of
the
mound
now
one
day
while
crom
duv
was
away
with
his
herd
flann
and
morag
were
in
the
courtyard
they
saw
the
little
red
hen
rouse
herself
up
shake
her
wings
and
turn
a
bright
eye
on
them
what
dost
thou
say
my
little
red
hen
said
morag
the
pooka
murmured
the
little
red
hen
the
pooka
rides
a
fierce
horse
but
the
pooka
himself
is
a
timid
little
then
the
little
red
hen
drooped
her
wings
again
and
went
on
picking
in
the
courtyard
the
pooka
rides
a
fierce
horse
said
morag
if
the
pooka
rides
a
fierce
horse
he
might
carry
us
past
the
bull
of
the
and
if
the
pooka
himself
is
a
timid
little
fellow
we
might
take
the
fierce
horse
from
him
said
flann
but
this
does
not
tell
us
how
to
get
the
berries
off
the
fairy
rowan
tree
said
morag
no
said
flann
it
does
not
tell
us
how
to
get
the
berries
off
the
tree
the
cats
the
next
day
morag
gave
grains
to
the
little
red
hen
and
begged
for
words
after
a
while
the
little
red
hen
murmured
there
are
things
i
know
and
things
i
don
t
know
but
i
do
know
what
grows
near
the
ground
and
if
you
pull
a
certain
herb
and
put
it
round
the
necks
of
the
cats
they
will
not
be
able
to
see
in
the
light
nor
in
the
dark
and
is
the
day
of
sowain
said
the
little
red
hen
she
said
no
more
words
she
had
become
sleepy
and
now
she
flew
down
and
roosted
under
the
table
there
she
went
on
murmuring
to
herself
as
all
hens
murmur
where
the
children
of
dana
hid
their
treasures
they
know
for
it
was
the
children
of
dana
who
brought
the
hens
to
ireland
said
morag
to
flann
follow
the
little
red
hen
and
if
she
makes
any
sign
when
she
touches
an
herb
that
grows
near
the
ground
pluck
that
herb
and
bring
it
to
that
night
morag
and
flann
talked
about
the
pooka
and
his
fierce
horse
on
sowain
night
the
night
before
the
real
short
days
begin
the
pooka
rides
through
the
countryside
touching
any
fruit
that
remains
so
that
it
may
bring
no
taste
into
winter
the
blackberries
that
were
good
to
eat
the
day
before
are
no
good
on
november
day
because
the
pooka
touched
them
the
night
before
what
else
the
pooka
does
no
one
really
knows
he
is
a
timid
fellow
as
the
little
red
hen
said
and
he
hopes
that
the
sight
of
his
big
black
horse
and
the
sound
of
its
trampling
and
panting
as
he
rides
by
will
frighten
people
out
of
his
way
for
he
has
a
great
fear
of
being
seen
the
next
day
the
little
red
hen
stayed
in
the
courtyard
until
crom
duv
left
with
his
herd
flann
followed
her
she
went
here
and
there
between
the
house
and
the
wall
at
the
back
now
picking
a
grain
of
sand
and
now
an
ant
or
spider
or
fly
and
as
she
went
about
the
little
red
hen
murmured
a
song
to
herself
when
sleep
would
settle
on
me
like
the
wild
bird
down
on
the
nest
the
wind
comes
out
of
the
west
it
tears
at
the
door
maybe
and
frightens
away
my
rest
when
sleep
would
come
upon
me
like
the
wild
bird
down
on
the
nest
the
cock
is
aloft
with
his
crest
the
comes
from
her
quest
she
fixes
an
eye
upon
me
and
frightens
away
my
rest
when
sleep
would
settle
on
me
like
the
wild
bird
down
on
its
nest
flann
watched
all
the
little
red
hen
did
he
saw
her
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
look
down
for
a
while
at
a
certain
herb
that
grew
near
the
ground
flann
plucked
that
herb
and
brought
it
to
morag
the
cattle
had
come
home
but
crom
duv
was
not
with
them
morag
milked
the
cows
and
brought
all
the
milk
within
leaving
no
milk
for
the
cats
to
drink
outside
six
came
into
the
kitchen
to
get
their
supper
there
one
after
another
they
sprang
up
on
the
table
one
more
proud
and
overbearing
than
the
other
each
cat
ate
without
condescending
to
make
a
single
mew
cat
of
my
heart
said
morag
to
the
first
when
he
had
finished
drinking
his
milk
cat
of
my
heart
how
noble
you
would
look
with
this
red
around
your
she
held
out
a
little
satchel
in
which
a
bit
of
the
herb
was
sewn
the
first
cat
gave
a
look
that
said
well
you
may
put
it
on
morag
put
the
red
satchel
around
his
neck
and
he
jumped
off
the
table
it
was
so
with
all
the
other
cats
they
finished
lapping
their
milk
and
morag
showed
them
the
red
ribbon
satchel
they
let
her
put
it
round
each
of
their
necks
and
then
they
sprang
off
the
table
and
marched
off
more
scornful
and
overbearing
than
before
six
of
the
fierce
yellow
cats
climbed
into
the
branches
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
six
stayed
in
the
kitchen
six
went
into
crom
duv
s
chamber
and
six
went
to
march
round
the
house
three
taking
each
side
no
sound
came
from
the
cats
that
were
within
or
without
morag
drew
a
ball
of
cotton
across
the
floor
and
the
cats
that
were
in
the
kitchen
gave
no
sign
of
seeing
it
the
sight
has
left
their
eyes
said
morag
then
said
flann
i
will
climb
the
fairy
rowan
tree
and
bring
down
two

sure

bring
down
two
my
dear
my

said
morag
they
went
out
to
the
courtyard
and
flann
began
to
climb
the
fairy
rowan
tree
with
all
suppleness
strength
and
cunning
the
cats
that
were
below
felt
him
going
up
the
tree
and
the
cats
that
were
above
humped
themselves
up
flann
passed
the
first
branch
on
which
a
cat
was
crouched
he
went
above
where
the
rowan
berries
were
and
bending
down
he
picked
two
of
them
and
put
them
into
his
mouth
he
came
down
quickly
with
the
cats
tearing
at
him
others
had
come
out
of
the
house
and
were
mewing
and
spitting
in
the
courtyard
only
one
had
fastened
itself
on
flann
s
jerkin
and
this
one
would
not
let
go
come
into
the
wood
come
into
the
wood
said
morag
now
we
must
stand
between
the
house
and
the
mound
and
wait
till
the
pooka
rides
flann
put
the
two
berries
into
her
hand
they
jumped
across
the
chain
and
ran
from
the
house
of
the
giant
crom
duv
vii
they
went
into
the
wood
flann
and
morag
and
the
little
red
hen
was
under
morag
s
arm
they
thought
they
would
hide
behind
trees
until
they
heard
the
coming
of
the
pooka
and
his
horse
but
they
were
not
far
in
the
wood
when
they
heard
crom
duv
coming
towards
his
house
he
came
towards
them
with
the
iron
spike
in
his
hand
flann
and
morag
ran
then
from
tree
to
tree
crom
duv
chased
them
shouting
and
snorting
and
smashing
down
branches
with
the
iron
spike
in
his
hand
morag
and
flann
came
to
a
stream
and
as
they
ran
along
its
bank
they
heard
the
trampling
and
panting
of
a
horse
coming
towards
them
up
it
came
a
great
black
horse
with
a
sweeping
mane
halt
pooka
said
flann
in
a
commanding
voice
the
black
horse
halted
and
the
pooka
that
was
its
rider
slipped
down
to
its
tail
flann
held
the
snorting
horse
and
morag
got
on
its
back
then
flann
sprang
up
between
morag
and
the
horse
s
head
crom
duv
was
just
beside
them
away
pooka
away
said
flann
and
the
horse
started
through
the
wood
like
the
wind
of
march
and
then
crom
duv
blew
on
the
horn
that
was
across
his
breast
and
the
bull

and
when

s
journey
away
so
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
flann
fedelma
and
gilveen
bade
to
the
queen
to
the
and
to
the
s
house
and
started
their
journey
towards
the
king
s
castle
with
macstairn
the
woodman
who
walked
beside
their
horses
a
big
axe
in
his
hands
at
night
macstairn
built
two
bothies
for
them
one
covered
with
green
boughs
for
fedelma
and
gilveen
and
one
covered
with
cut
sods
for
flann
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
flann
lay
near
the
opening
of
this
bothie
and
at
night
when
the
only
stir
in
the
forest
was
that
of
the
leaves
whispering
to
the
secret
people
gilveen
arose
from
where
she
lay
and
came
to
the
other
bothie
and
whispered
flann
s
name
he
awakened
and
thinking
that
morag
had
come
back
to
him
he
had
been
dreaming
of
her
he
put
out
his
arms
drew
gilveen
to
him
and
kissed
her
then
gilveen
ran
back
to
her
own
bothie
and
flann
did
not
know
whether
he
had
awakened
or
whether
he
had
remained
in
a
dream
but
when
he
arose
the
next
morning
no
thought
of
morag
was
in
his
mind
and
when
the
king
s
son
rode
with
fedelma
he
rode
with
gilveen
afterwards
gilveen
gave
him
a
drink
that
enchanted
him
so
that
he
thought
of
her
night
and
day
neither
fedelma
nor
the
king
s
son
knew
what
had
come
over
flann
they
mentioned
the
name
he
had
spoken
of
so
often
morag
s
name
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
no
meaning
for
him
at
noon
they
halted
to
bide
until
the
queen
came
with
or
without
her
seven
brothers
flann
and
gilveen
were
always
together
and
always
gilveen
was
smiling
iii
when
caintigern
had
come
when
she
knew
her
son
flann
and
when
it
was
known
to
her
and
to
the
that
the
token
morag
had
given
him
held
the
seven
drops
of
heart
s
blood
that
would
bring
back
to
their
own
forms
the
seven
wild
geese
that
were
caintigern
s
brothers
when
all
this
was
known
the
sent
her
most
secret
messenger
to
the
marshes
to
give
word
to
the
seven
wild
geese
that
they
were
to
fly
to
her
house
on
the
night
when
the
moon
was
full
her
messenger
was
the
corncrake
she
traveled
night
and
day
running
swiftly
through
the
meadows
she
hid
on
the
edge
of
the
marshes
and
craked
out
her
message
to
the
seven
wild
geese
at
last
they
heard
what
she
said
on
the
day
before
the
night
of
the
full
moon
they
flew
the
seven
together
towards
the
s
house
no
one
was
in
the
house
but
caintigern
the
queen
the
door
was
left
open
to
the
light
of
the
moon
the
seven
wild
geese
flew
down
and
stayed
outside
the
door
moving
their
heads
and
wings
in
the
full
moonlight
then
caintigern
arose
and
took
bread
that
the
had
made
she
moistened
it
in
her
mouth
and
into
each
bit
of
moistened
bread
she
put
a
piece
of
the
handkerchief
that
had
a
drop
of
blood
she
held
out
her
hand
giving
each
the
moistened
bread
the
first
that
ate
it
fell
forward
on
the
floor
of
the
s
house
his
head
down
on
the
ground
his
sister
saw
him
then
as
a
kneeling
man
with
this
arms
held
behind
him
as
if
they
were
bound
and
when
she
looked
outside
she
saw
the
others
like
kneeling
men
with
their
heads
bent
and
their
arms
held
behind
them
then
caintigern
said
giving
the
her
secret
name
o
grania
oi
let
it
be
that
my
brothers
be
changed
back
to
men
when
she
said
this
she
saw
the
coming
across
the
the
waved
her
hands
over
the
bent
figures
they
lifted
themselves
up
as
men
as
naked
gray
men
the
gave
each
a
garment
and
the
seven
men
came
into
the
house
they
would
stand
and
not
sit
and
for
long
they
had
no
speech
their
sister
knelt
before
each
and
wet
his
hand
with
her
tears
she
thought
she
should
see
them
as
youths
or
as
young
men
and
they
were
gray
now
and
past
the
prime
of
their
lives
they
stayed
at
the
house
and
speech
came
back
to
them
then
they
longed
to
go
back
to
their
father
s
but
caintigern
could
not
bear
that
they
should
go
from
her
sight
at
last
four
of
her
brothers
went
and
three
stayed
with
her
they
would
go
to
her
husband
s
castle
and
the
others
would
go
too
after
they
had
been
at
their
father
s
then
one
day
caintigern
said
farewell
the
thanks
that
was
due
to
the
she
said
she
would
give
by
her
treatment
of
the
maid
who
had
given
the
token
to
her
son
flann
and
she
prayed
that
morag
would
soon
come
to
the
king
s
castle
she
went
with
her
three
brothers
to
the
place
where
flann
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
fedelma
and
gilveen
waited
for
them

smith
groomed
and
decked
horses
for
all
of
them
and
they
rode
towards
the
king
of
ireland
s
castle
macstairn
the
woodman
going
before
to
announce
their
coming
the

at
the
stone
where
the
riders
to
his
castle
dismount
and
his
steward
his
councillor
and
his
druid
were
beside
him
he
lifted
his
wife
off
her
horse
and
she
brought
him
to
flann
and
when
the
king
looked
into
flann
s
eyes
he
knew
he
was
his
son
and
the
son
of
sheen
now
known
as
caintigern
he
gave
flann
a
father
s
clasp
of
welcome
and
the
queen
brought
him
to
her
own
three
brothers
who
had
been
estranged
from
human
companionship
from
before
he
knew
her
and
she
brought
him
to
the
youth
who
was
always
known
as
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
him
his
father
welcomed
from
the
path
of
danger
and
then
the
king
s
son
took
fedelma
to
his
father
and
told
him
she
was
his
love
and
his
wife
to
be
and
the
king
welcomed
fedelma
to
the
castle
then
said
gilveen
there
is
a
secret
between
this
young
man
flann
and
what
is
the
secret
said
the
queen
laying
her
hands
suddenly
upon
gilveen
s
shoulders
that
i
am
his
wife
to
be
said
gilveen
the
queen
went
to
her
son
and
said
dost
thou
not
remember
morag
flann
who
gave
the
token
that
thou
gavest
me
and
flann
said
morag
i
think

a
i
am
flann
s
wife
to
be
said
gilveen
smiling
in
his
face
yes

then
the
king
welcomed
gilveen
too
and
they
all
went
into
the
castle
he
told
his
wife
he
had
messages
from
the
king
of
senlabor
about
his
other
sons
dermott
and
downal
saying
that
they
were
making
good
names
for
themselves
and
that
everything
they
did
was
becoming
to
sons
of
kings
in
the
hall
fedelma
saw
aefa
her
other
sister
aefa
was
so
proud
of
herself
since
she
married
maravaun
the
king
s
councillor
that
she
would
hardly
speak
to
anyone
she
gave
her
sisters
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
she
bowed
very
slightingly
to
the
two
youths
the
king
questioned
his
druid
as
to
when
it
would
be
well
to
have
marriages
made
in
his
castle
and
the
druid
said
it
would
be
well
not
to
make
them
until
the
next
appearance
of
the
full
moon
iv
as
for
morag
she
went
by
track
and
path
by
boher
and
bohereen
through
fords
in
rivers
and
over
across
them
until
at
last
she
came
to
the
country
of
senlabor
and
to
the
castle
of
the
king
no
one
of
high
degree
was
in
the
castle
for
all
had
gone
to
watch
the
young
horses
being
broken
in
the
meadow
by
the
river
the
king
and
queen
had
gone
and
the
king
s
and
of
the
maids
in
the
castle
baun
and
deelish
had
gone
too
the
king
s
councillor
also
had
gone
from
the
castle
morag
went
and
stayed
in
the
kitchen
and
the
maids
who
were
there
did
not
know
her
either
because
they
were
new
and
had
not
heard
her
spoken
of
at
all
or
because
she
had
changed
to
such
beauty
through
eating
the
berry
of
the
fairy
rowan
tree
that
no
one
could
know
her
now
for
morag
who
had
cleaned
dishes
in
that
kitchen
before
it
was
breas
the
king
s
steward
who
came
to
her
and
asked
her
who
she
was
she
told
him
then
breas
looked
sharply
at
her
and
saw
she
was
indeed
morag
who
had
been
in
the
king
s
kitchen
then
he
said
loudly
before
you
left
you
broke
the
dish
that
the
king
looked
on
as
his
especial
treasure
and
for
this
you
will
be
left
in
the
stone
house
i
who
have
power
in
this
matter
order
that
it
be
then
he
said
in
her
ear
but
kisses
and
sweet
words
would
make
me
willing
to
save
morag
in
a
voice
raised
called
him
by
that
evil
name
that
he
was
known
by
to
the
servants
and
their
gossips
but
the
servants
hearing
that
name
said
in
the
hearing
of
breas
pretended
to
be
scandalized
they
went
to
morag
and
struck
her
with
the
besoms
they
had
for
sweeping
the
floor
just
then
her
baun
and
deelish
came
into
the
kitchen
seeing
her
there
they
knew
her
they
spoke
to
her
quietly
but
with
anger
saying
they
had
not
wanted
her
to
go
on
the
journey
she
had
taken
but
as
she
had
gone
it
was
a
pity
she
had
come
back
for
now
she
had
behaved
in
an
way
and
they
who
were
her
would
be
thought
to
be
as
they
told
her
too
that
before
she
came
back
they
were
by
all
and
that
breas
had
even
ordered
a
shady
place
to
be
given
them
at
the
sports
and
they
had
been
able
to
see
the
two
youths
who
had
broken
the
horses
dermott
and
downal
it
was
for
a
benefit
to
you
that
i
came
back
said
morag
i
shall
ask
one
of
you
to
do
a
thing
for
me
you
baun
sing
for
the
of
the
king
before
they
sleep
ask
them
to
tell
the
queen
that
morag
has
returned
and
has
a
thing
to
give
i
shall
try
to
remember
that
morag
said
baun
morag
was
taken
to
the
stone
house
by
bondswomen
and
baun
and
deelish
sat
in
corners
and
cried
and
did
not
go
near
her
that
night
the
king
s
kept
awake
for
long
and
after
baun
had
sung
to
them
they
asked
her
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
in
the
castle
then
baun
remembered
the
tumult
in
the
kitchen
that
had
come
from
the
name
given
to
breas
she
told
the
king
s
that
morag
had
come
back
she
was
reared
in
the
same
house
with
us
said
baun
but
she
is
not
of
the
same
and
then
she
said
if
your
fair
finenesses
can
remember
tell
the
queen
that
morag
has
come
the
next
day
when
they
were
walking
with
the
queen
one
of
the
king
s
said
did
you
know
of
a
maid
named
morag
i
have
heard
that
she
has
been
away
and
has
come
how

she
fare
said
the
queen
we
have
not
heard
that
said
the
maiden
who
spoke
the
queen
went
to
where
baun
and
deelish
were
and
from
them
she
heard
that
morag

into
the
stone
house
on
the
charge
that
she
had
broken
the
king
s
dish
when

been
in
the
castle
before
now
the
queen
knew
that
the
dish
had
been
safe
after
morag
had
left
she
went
to
the
king
s
steward
and
accused
him
of
having
broken
it
and
breas
admitted
that
it
was
so
thereupon
he
lost
his
rank
and
became
the
meanest
and
the
most
despised
servant
in
the
castle
the
queen
went
to
the
stone
house
and
took
morag
out
she
asked
her
how
she
had
fared
and
thereupon
morag
put
the
rowan
berry
in
the
queen
s
hand
she
hastened
to
her
own
chamber
and
ate
it
and
her
youth
and
beauty
came
back
to
her
and
the
king
who
had
grown
solitary
loved
the
queen
again
then
morag
came
to
great
honor
in
the
castle
and
the
queen
asked
her
to
name
the
greatest
favor
she
could
think
of
and
the
favor
that
morag
named
was

for
her
with

said
the
little
red
hen
and
flann
heard
the
words
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
little
red
hen
on
the
table
and
knew
that
she
belonged
to
one
that
he
had
known
morag
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
looked
strange
and
shadowy
to
him
but
he
threw
crumbs
on
the
table
and
fed
the
little
red
hen
and
as
he
watched
her
picking
up
the
crumbs
the
memory
of
morag
came
back
to
him
then
he
saw
her
he
knew
her
for
his
sweetheart
and
his
promised
wife
and
he
went
to
her
and
asked
her
how
it
came
that
she
had
not
been
in
his
mind
for
so
long
i
will
tell
you
how
you
came
to
forget
me
said
she
it
was
because
of
the
kiss
you
gave
gilveen
and
the
enchantment
she
was
able
to
put
on
you
because
of
that
there
was
sorrow
on
morag
s
face
when
she
said
that
but
the
sorrow
went
as
the
thin
clouds
go
from
before
the
face
of
the
moon
and
flann
saw
her
as
his
kind
comrade
of
crom
duv
s
and
as
his
beautiful
friend
of
the
s
house
they
kissed
each
other
then
and
every
enchantment
went
but
the
lasting
enchantment
of
love
and
they
sat
with
hands
joined
until
the
log
in
the
fire
beside
them
had
burnt
itself
down
into
a
brand
and
the
brand
had
burnt
itself
into
ashes
and
all
the
time
that
passed
was
as
they
thought
only
while
the
outside
walked
from
one
side
of
the
castle
gate
to
the
other
gilveen
had
come
into
the
room
and
she
saw
flann
and
morag
give
each
other
a
s
kiss
she
went
away
but
the
next
day
she
came
to
the
king
s
steward
art
who
at
one
time
wanted
to
marry
her
and
whom
she
had
refused
because
aefa
her
sister
had
married
one
of
a
higher
degree
she
came
to
art
and
she
told
him
that
she
would
not
marry
flann
because
she
had
found
out
that
he
had
a
sweetheart
and
i
am
ready
to
marry
you
art
she
said
and
art
was
well
pleased
and
he
and
gilveen
left
the
castle
to
be
married
then
the
day
came
when
fedelma
and
the
king
of
ireland
s
son
and
morag
and
flann
were
married
they
were
plighted
to
each
other
in
the
circle
of
stones
by
the
druids
who
invoked
upon
them
the
powers
of
the
sun
the
moon
the
earth
and
the
air
they
were
married
at
the
height
of
the
day
and
they
feasted
at
night
when
the
wax
candles
were
lighted
round
the
tables
they
had
greek
honey
and
lochlinn
beer
ducks
from
achill
apples
from
emain
and
venison
from
the
hunting
hill
they
had
trout
and
grouse
and
plovers
eggs
and
a
boar
s
head
for
every
king
in
the
company
and
these
were
the
kings
who
sat
down
to
table
with
the
king
of
eirinn
the
king
of
sorcha
the
king
of
hispania
the
king
of
lochlinn
and
the
king
of
the
green
island
who
had
sunbeam
for
his
daughter
and
they
had
there
the
best
heroes
of
lochlinn
the
best
of
alba
the
best
bards
of
eirinn
they
laid
sorrow
and
they
raised
music
and
the
harpers
played
until
the
great
champion
told
a
tale
of
the
realm
of
greece
and
how
he
slew
the
three
lions
that
guarded
the
daughter
of
the
king
they
feasted
for
six
days
and
the
last
day
was
better
than
the
first
and
the
laugh
they
laughed
when
witless
the
saxon
fool
told
how
s
story
should
have
ended
shook
the
young
jackdaws
out
of
every
chimney
in
the
castle
and
brought
them
down
fluttering
on
the
floors
the
king
of
ireland
lived
long
but
he
died
while
his
sons
were
in
their
strong
manhood
and
after
he
passed
away
the
island
of
destiny
came
under
the
equal
rule
of
the
two
and
one
had
rule
over
the
courts
and
cities
the
harbors
and
the
military
encampments
and
the
other
had
rule
over
the
waste
places
and
the
villages
and
the
roads
where
masterless
men
walked
and
the
deeds
of
one
are
in
the
histories
the
shanachies
have
written
in
the
language
of
the
learned
and
the
deeds
of
the
other
are
in
the
stories
the
people
tell
to
you
and
to
me
when
i
crossed
the
ford
they
were
turning
the
mountain
pass
when
i
stood
on
the
they
were
travelling
the
road
of
glass
