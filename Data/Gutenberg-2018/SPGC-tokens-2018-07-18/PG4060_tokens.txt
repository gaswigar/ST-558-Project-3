many
attempts
have
been
made
by
writers
on
art
and
poetry
to
define
beauty
in
the
abstract
to
express
it
in
the
most
general
terms
to
find
some
universal
formula
for
it
the
value
of
these
attempts
has
most
often
been
in
the
suggestive
and
penetrating
things
said
by
the
way
such
discussions
help
us
very
little
to
enjoy
what
has
been
well
done
in
art
or
poetry
to
discriminate
between
what
is
more
and
what
is
less
excellent
in
them
or
to
use
words
like
beauty
excellence
art
poetry
with
a
more
precise
meaning
than
they
would
otherwise
have
beauty
like
all
other
qualities
presented
to
human
experience
is
relative
and
the
definition
of
it
becomes
unmeaning
and
useless
in
proportion
to
its
abstractness
to
define
beauty
not
in
the
most
abstract
but
in
the
most
concrete
terms
possible
to
find
not
its
universal
formula
but
the
formula
which
expresses
most
adequately
this
or
that
viii
special
manifestation
of
it
is
the
aim
of
the
true
student
of
aesthetics
to
see
the
object
as
in
itself
it
really
is
has
been
justly
said
to
be
the
aim
of
all
true
criticism
whatever
and
in
aesthetic
criticism
the
first
step
towards
seeing
one
object
as
it
really
is
is
to
know
one
own
impression
as
it
really
is
to
discriminate
it
to
realise
it
distinctly
the
objects
with
which
aesthetic
criticism
deals
music
poetry
artistic
and
accomplished
forms
of
human
life
are
indeed
receptacles
of
so
many
powers
or
forces
they
possess
like
the
products
of
nature
so
many
virtues
or
qualities
what
is
this
song
or
picture
this
engaging
personality
presented
in
life
or
in
a
book
to
me
what
effect
does
it
really
produce
on
me
does
it
give
me
pleasure
and
if
so
what
sort
or
degree
of
pleasure
how
is
my
nature
modified
by
its
presence
and
under
its
influence
the
answers
to
these
questions
are
the
original
facts
with
which
the
aesthetic
critic
has
to
do
and
as
in
the
study
of
light
of
morals
of
number
one
must
realise
such
primary
data
for
one
self
or
not
at
all
and
he
who
experiences
these
impressions
strongly
and
drives
directly
at
the
discrimination
and
analysis
of
them
has
no
need
to
trouble
himself
with
the
abstract
question
what
beauty
is
in
itself
or
what
its
exact
relation
to
truth
or
ix
experience
metaphysical
questions
as
unprofitable
as
metaphysical
questions
elsewhere
he
may
pass
them
all
by
as
being
answerable
or
not
of
no
interest
to
him
the
aesthetic
critic
then
regards
all
the
objects
with
which
he
has
to
do
all
works
of
art
and
the
fairer
forms
of
nature
and
human
life
as
powers
or
forces
producing
pleasurable
sensations
each
of
a
more
or
less
peculiar
or
unique
kind
this
influence
he
feels
and
wishes
to
explain
by
analysing
and
reducing
it
to
its
elements
to
him
the
picture
the
landscape
the
engaging
personality
in
life
or
in
a
book
la
gioconda
the
hills
of
carrara
pico
of
mirandola
are
valuable
for
their
virtues
as
we
say
in
speaking
of
a
herb
a
wine
a
gem
for
the
property
each
has
of
affecting
one
with
a
special
a
unique
impression
of
pleasure
our
education
becomes
complete
in
proportion
as
our
susceptibility
to
these
impressions
increases
in
depth
and
variety
and
the
function
of
the
aesthetic
critic
is
to
distinguish
to
analyse
and
separate
from
its
adjuncts
the
virtue
by
which
a
picture
a
landscape
a
fair
personality
in
life
or
in
a
book
produces
this
special
impression
of
beauty
or
pleasure
to
indicate
what
the
source
of
that
impression
is
and
under
what
conditions
it
is
experienced
his
end
is
reached
when
he
has
disengaged
that
x
virtue
and
noted
it
as
a
chemist
notes
some
natural
element
for
himself
and
others
and
the
rule
for
those
who
would
reach
this
end
is
stated
with
great
exactness
in
the
words
of
a
recent
critic
of
de
se
borner
ŕ
connaître
de
prčs
les
belles
choses
et
ŕ
nourrir
en
exquis
amateurs
en
humanistes
accomplis
what
is
important
then
is
not
that
the
critic
should
possess
a
correct
abstract
definition
of
beauty
for
the
intellect
but
a
certain
kind
of
temperament
the
power
of
being
deeply
moved
by
the
presence
of
beautiful
objects
he
will
remember
always
that
beauty
exists
in
many
forms
to
him
all
periods
types
schools
of
taste
are
in
themselves
equal
in
all
ages
there
have
been
some
excellent
workmen
and
some
excellent
work
done
the
question
he
asks
is
always
in
whom
did
the
stir
the
genius
the
sentiment
of
the
period
find
itself
where
was
the
receptacle
of
its
refinement
its
elevation
its
taste
the
ages
are
all
equal
says
william
blake
but
genius
is
always
above
its
age
often
it
will
require
great
nicety
to
disengage
this
virtue
from
the
commoner
elements
with
which
it
may
be
found
in
combination
few
artists
not
goethe
or
byron
even
work
quite
cleanly
casting
off
all
débris
and
leaving
us
only
what
the
heat
of
their
imagination
has
wholly
xi
fused
and
transformed
take
for
instance
the
writings
of
wordsworth
the
heat
of
his
genius
entering
into
the
substance
of
his
work
has
crystallised
a
part
but
only
a
part
of
it
and
in
that
great
mass
of
verse
there
is
much
which
might
well
be
forgotten
but
scattered
up
and
down
it
sometimes
fusing
and
transforming
entire
compositions
like
the
stanzas
on
resolution
and
independence
or
the
ode
on
the
recollections
of
childhood
sometimes
as
if
at
random
depositing
a
fine
crystal
here
or
there
in
a
matter
it
does
not
wholly
search
through
and
transmute
we
trace
the
action
of
his
unique
incommunicable
faculty
that
strange
mystical
sense
of
a
life
in
natural
things
and
of
man
life
as
a
part
of
nature
drawing
strength
and
colour
and
character
from
local
influences
from
the
hills
and
streams
and
from
natural
sights
and
sounds
well
that
is
the
virtue
the
active
principle
in
poetry
and
then
the
function
of
the
critic
of
wordsworth
is
to
follow
up
that
active
principle
to
disengage
it
to
mark
the
degree
in
which
it
penetrates
his
verse
the
subjects
of
the
following
studies
are
taken
from
the
history
of
the
renaissance
and
touch
what
i
think
the
chief
points
in
that
complex
movement
i
have
explained
in
the
first
of
them
what
i
understand
by
the
word
xii
giving
it
a
much
wider
scope
than
was
intended
by
those
who
originally
used
it
to
denote
that
revival
of
classical
antiquity
in
the
fifteenth
century
which
was
only
one
of
many
results
of
a
general
excitement
and
enlightening
of
the
human
mind
but
of
which
the
great
aim
and
achievements
of
what
as
christian
art
is
often
falsely
opposed
to
the
renaissance
were
another
result
this
outbreak
of
the
human
spirit
may
be
traced
far
into
the
middle
age
itself
with
its
motives
already
clearly
pronounced
the
care
for
physical
beauty
the
worship
of
the
body
the
breaking
down
of
those
limits
which
the
religious
system
of
the
middle
age
imposed
on
the
heart
and
the
imagination
i
have
taken
as
an
example
of
this
movement
this
earlier
renaissance
within
the
middle
age
itself
and
as
an
expression
of
its
qualities
two
little
compositions
in
early
french
not
because
they
constitute
the
best
possible
expression
of
them
but
because
they
help
the
unity
of
my
series
inasmuch
as
the
renaissance
ends
also
in
france
in
french
poetry
in
a
phase
of
which
the
writings
of
joachim
du
bellay
are
in
many
ways
the
most
perfect
illustration
the
renaissance
in
truth
put
forth
in
france
an
aftermath
a
wonderful
later
growth
the
products
of
which
have
to
the
full
that
subtle
and
delicate
sweetness
which
belongs
to
a
refined
and
comely
xiii
decadence
just
as
its
earliest
phases
have
the
freshness
which
belongs
to
all
periods
of
growth
in
art
the
charm
of
ascęsis
of
the
austere
and
serious
girding
of
the
loins
in
youth
but
it
is
in
italy
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
the
interest
of
the
renaissance
mainly
lies
in
that
solemn
fifteenth
century
which
can
hardly
be
studied
too
much
not
merely
for
its
positive
results
in
the
things
of
the
intellect
and
the
imagination
its
concrete
works
of
art
its
special
and
prominent
personalities
with
their
profound
aesthetic
charm
but
for
its
general
spirit
and
character
for
the
ethical
qualities
of
which
it
is
a
consummate
type
the
various
forms
of
intellectual
activity
which
together
make
up
the
culture
of
an
age
move
for
the
most
part
from
different
and
by
unconnected
roads
as
products
of
the
same
generation
they
partake
indeed
of
a
common
character
and
unconsciously
illustrate
each
other
but
of
the
producers
themselves
each
group
is
solitary
gaining
what
advantage
or
disadvantage
there
may
be
in
intellectual
isolation
art
and
poetry
philosophy
and
the
religious
life
and
that
other
life
of
refined
pleasure
and
action
in
the
conspicuous
places
of
the
world
are
each
of
them
confined
to
its
own
circle
of
ideas
and
those
who
prosecute
either
of
them
are
generally
little
xiv
curious
of
the
thoughts
of
others
there
come
however
from
time
to
time
eras
of
more
favourable
conditions
in
which
the
thoughts
of
men
draw
nearer
together
than
is
their
wont
and
the
many
interests
of
the
intellectual
world
combine
in
one
complete
type
of
general
culture
the
fifteenth
century
in
italy
is
one
of
these
happier
eras
and
what
is
sometimes
said
of
the
age
of
pericles
is
true
of
that
of
lorenzo
it
is
an
age
productive
in
personalities
centralised
complete
here
artists
and
philosophers
and
those
whom
the
action
of
the
world
has
elevated
and
made
keen
do
not
live
in
isolation
but
breathe
a
common
air
and
catch
light
and
heat
from
each
other
thoughts
there
is
a
spirit
of
general
elevation
and
enlightenment
in
which
all
alike
communicate
the
unity
of
this
spirit
gives
unity
to
all
the
various
products
of
the
renaissance
and
it
is
to
this
intimate
alliance
with
the
mind
this
participation
in
the
best
thoughts
which
that
age
produced
that
the
art
of
italy
in
the
fifteenth
century
owes
much
of
its
grave
dignity
and
influence
i
have
added
an
essay
on
winckelmann
as
not
incongruous
with
the
studies
which
precede
it
because
winckelmann
coming
in
the
eighteenth
century
really
belongs
in
spirit
to
an
earlier
age
by
his
enthusiasm
for
the
things
of
the
intellect
xv
and
the
imagination
for
their
own
sake
by
his
hellenism
his
struggle
to
attain
the
greek
spirit
he
is
in
sympathy
with
the
humanists
of
a
previous
century
he
is
the
last
fruit
of
the
renaissance
and
explains
in
a
striking
way
its
motive
and
tendencies
two
early
french
stories
yet
shall
ye
be
as
the
wings
of
a
dove
the
history
of
the
renaissance
ends
in
france
and
carries
us
away
from
italy
to
the
beautiful
cities
of
the
country
of
the
loire
but
it
was
in
france
also
in
a
very
important
sense
that
the
renaissance
had
begun
french
writers
who
are
fond
of
connecting
the
creations
of
italian
genius
with
a
french
origin
who
tell
us
how
saint
francis
of
assisi
took
not
his
name
only
but
all
those
notions
of
chivalry
and
romantic
love
which
so
deeply
penetrated
his
thoughts
from
a
french
source
how
boccaccio
borrowed
the
outlines
of
his
stories
from
the
old
french
fabliaux
and
how
dante
himself
expressly
connects
the
origin
of
the
art
of
with
the
city
of
paris
have
often
dwelt
on
this
notion
of
a
renaissance
in
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
renaissance
within
the
limits
of
the
middle
age
itself
a
brilliant
but
in
part
abortive
effort
to
do
for
human
life
and
the
human
mind
what
was
afterwards
done
in
the
fifteenth
the
word
renaissance
indeed
is
now
generally
used
to
denote
not
merely
the
revival
of
classical
antiquity
which
took
place
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
to
which
the
word
was
first
applied
but
a
whole
complex
movement
of
which
that
revival
of
classical
antiquity
was
but
one
element
or
symptom
for
us
the
renaissance
is
the
name
of
a
but
yet
united
movement
in
which
the
love
of
the
things
of
the
intellect
and
the
imagination
for
their
own
sake
the
desire
for
a
more
liberal
and
comely
way
of
conceiving
life
make
themselves
felt
urging
those
who
experience
this
desire
to
search
out
first
one
and
then
another
means
of
intellectual
or
imaginative
enjoyment
and
directing
them
not
only
to
the
discovery
of
old
and
forgotten
sources
of
this
enjoyment
but
to
the
divination
of
fresh
sources
thereof
new
experiences
new
subjects
of
poetry
new
forms
of
art
of
such
feeling
there
was
a
great
outbreak
in
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
following
century
here
and
there
under
rare
and
happy
conditions
in
pointed
architecture
in
the
doctrines
of
romantic
love
in
the
poetry
of
provence
the
rude
strength
of
the
middle
age
turns
to
sweetness
and
the
taste
for
sweetness
generated
there
becomes
the
seed
of
the
classical
revival
in
it
prompting
it
constantly
to
seek
after
the
springs
of
perfect
sweetness
in
the
hellenic
world
and
coming
after
a
long
period
in
which
this
instinct
had
been
crushed
that
true
dark
age
in
which
so
many
sources
of
intellectual
and
imaginative
enjoyment
had
actually
disappeared
this
outbreak
is
rightly
called
a
renaissance
a
revival
theories
which
bring
into
connexion
with
each
other
modes
of
thought
and
feeling
periods
of
taste
forms
of
art
and
poetry
which
the
narrowness
of
men
minds
constantly
tends
to
oppose
to
each
other
have
a
great
stimulus
for
the
intellect
and
are
almost
always
worth
understanding
it
is
so
with
this
theory
of
a
renaissance
within
the
middle
age
which
seeks
to
establish
a
continuity
between
the
most
characteristic
work
of
that
period
the
sculpture
of
chartres
the
windows
of
le
mans
and
the
work
of
the
later
renaissance
the
work
of
jean
cousin
and
germain
pilon
thus
healing
that
rupture
between
the
middle
age
and
the
renaissance
which
has
so
often
been
exaggerated
but
it
is
not
so
much
the
ecclesiastical
art
of
the
middle
age
its
sculpture
and
painting
work
certainly
done
in
a
great
measure
for
sake
in
which
even
a
secular
a
rebellious
spirit
often
betrays
itself
but
rather
its
profane
poetry
the
poetry
of
provence
and
the
magnificent
of
that
poetry
in
italy
and
france
which
those
french
writers
have
in
view
when
they
speak
of
this
medieval
renaissance
in
that
poetry
earthly
passion
with
its
intimacy
its
freedom
its
variety
the
liberty
of
the
heart
makes
itself
felt
and
the
name
of
abelard
the
great
scholar
and
the
great
lover
connects
the
expression
of
this
liberty
of
heart
with
the
free
play
of
human
intelligence
around
all
subjects
presented
to
it
with
the
liberty
of
the
intellect
as
that
age
understood
it
every
one
knows
the
legend
of
abelard
a
legend
hardly
less
passionate
certainly
not
less
characteristic
of
the
middle
age
than
the
legend
of
tannhäuser
how
the
famous
and
comely
clerk
in
whom
wisdom
herself
pleasant
and
discreet
seemed
to
sit
enthroned
came
to
live
in
the
house
of
a
canon
of
the
church
of
where
dwelt
a
girl
heloďse
believed
to
be
the
old
priest
orphan
niece
how
the
old
priest
had
testified
his
love
for
her
by
giving
her
an
education
then
unrivalled
so
that
rumour
asserted
that
through
the
knowledge
of
languages
enabling
her
to
penetrate
into
the
mysteries
of
the
older
world
she
had
become
a
sorceress
like
the
celtic
druidesses
and
how
as
abelard
and
heloďse
sat
together
at
home
there
to
refine
a
little
further
on
the
nature
of
abstract
ideas
love
made
himself
of
the
party
with
them
you
conceive
the
temptations
of
the
scholar
who
in
such
dreamy
tranquillity
amid
the
bright
and
busy
spectacle
of
the
island
lived
in
a
world
of
something
like
shadows
and
that
for
one
who
knew
so
well
how
to
assign
its
exact
value
to
every
abstract
thought
those
restraints
which
lie
on
the
consciences
of
other
men
had
been
relaxed
it
appears
that
he
composed
many
verses
in
the
vulgar
tongue
already
the
young
men
sang
them
on
the
quay
below
the
house
those
songs
says
de
rémusat
were
probably
in
the
taste
of
the
trouvčres
of
whom
he
was
one
of
the
first
in
date
or
so
to
speak
the
predecessor
it
is
the
same
spirit
which
has
moulded
the
famous
letters
written
in
the
quaint
latin
of
the
middle
age
at
the
foot
of
that
early
gothic
tower
which
the
next
generation
raised
to
grace
the
precincts
of
abelard
school
on
the
mountain
of
saint
genevičve
the
historian
michelet
sees
in
thought
a
terrible
assembly
not
the
hearers
of
abelard
alone
fifty
bishops
twenty
cardinals
two
popes
the
whole
body
of
scholastic
philosophy
not
only
the
learned
heloďse
the
teaching
of
languages
and
the
renaissance
but
arnold
of
brescia
that
is
to
say
the
revolution
and
so
from
the
rooms
of
this
shadowy
house
by
the
seine
side
we
see
that
spirit
going
abroad
with
its
qualities
already
well
defined
its
intimacy
its
languid
sweetness
its
rebellion
its
subtle
skill
in
dividing
the
elements
of
human
passion
its
care
for
physical
beauty
its
worship
of
the
body
which
penetrated
the
early
literature
of
italy
and
finds
an
echo
even
in
dante
that
abelard
is
not
mentioned
in
the
divine
comedy
may
appear
a
singular
omission
to
the
reader
of
dante
who
seems
to
have
inwoven
into
the
texture
of
his
work
whatever
had
impressed
him
as
either
effective
in
colour
or
spiritually
significant
among
the
recorded
incidents
of
actual
life
nowhere
in
his
great
poem
do
we
find
the
name
nor
so
much
as
an
allusion
to
the
story
of
one
who
had
left
so
deep
a
mark
on
the
philosophy
of
which
dante
was
an
eager
student
of
whom
in
the
latin
quarter
and
from
the
lips
of
scholar
or
teacher
in
the
university
of
paris
during
his
sojourn
among
them
he
can
hardly
have
failed
to
hear
we
can
only
suppose
that
he
had
indeed
considered
the
story
and
the
man
and
abstained
from
passing
judgment
as
to
his
place
in
the
scheme
of
eternal
justice
in
the
famous
legend
of
tannhäuser
the
erring
knight
makes
his
way
to
rome
to
seek
absolution
at
the
centre
of
christian
religion
so
soon
thought
and
said
the
pope
as
the
staff
in
his
hand
should
bud
and
blossom
so
soon
might
the
soul
of
tannhäuser
be
saved
and
no
sooner
and
it
came
to
pass
not
long
after
that
the
dry
wood
of
a
staff
which
the
pope
had
carried
in
his
hand
was
covered
with
leaves
and
flowers
so
in
the
cloister
of
godstow
a
petrified
tree
was
shown
of
which
the
nuns
told
that
the
fair
rosamond
who
had
died
among
them
had
declared
that
the
tree
being
then
alive
and
green
it
would
be
changed
into
stone
at
the
hour
of
her
salvation
when
abelard
died
like
tannhäuser
he
was
on
his
way
to
rome
what
might
have
happened
had
he
reached
his
journey
end
is
uncertain
and
it
is
in
this
uncertain
twilight
that
his
relation
to
the
general
beliefs
of
his
age
has
always
remained
in
this
as
in
other
things
he
prefigures
the
character
of
the
renaissance
that
movement
in
which
in
various
ways
the
human
mind
wins
for
itself
a
new
kingdom
of
feeling
and
sensation
and
thought
not
opposed
to
but
only
beyond
and
independent
of
the
spiritual
system
then
actually
realised
the
opposition
into
which
abelard
is
thrown
which
gives
its
colour
to
his
career
which
breaks
his
soul
to
pieces
is
a
no
less
subtle
opposition
than
that
between
the
merely
professional
official
hireling
ministers
of
that
system
with
their
ignorant
worship
of
system
for
its
own
sake
and
the
true
child
of
light
the
humanist
with
reason
and
heart
and
senses
quick
while
theirs
were
almost
dead
he
reaches
out
towards
he
attains
modes
of
ideal
living
beyond
the
prescribed
limits
of
that
system
though
in
essential
germ
it
may
be
contained
within
it
as
always
happens
the
adherents
of
the
poorer
and
narrower
culture
had
no
sympathy
with
because
no
understanding
of
a
culture
richer
and
more
ample
than
their
own
after
the
discovery
of
wheat
they
would
still
live
upon
acorns
aprčs
du
blé
ils
voulaient
encore
vivre
du
gland
and
would
hear
of
no
service
to
the
higher
needs
of
humanity
with
instruments
not
of
their
forging
but
the
human
spirit
bold
through
those
needs
was
too
strong
for
them
abelard
and
heloďse
write
their
letters
letters
with
a
wonderful
outpouring
of
soul
in
medieval
latin
and
abelard
though
he
composes
songs
in
the
vulgar
tongue
writes
also
in
latin
those
treatises
in
which
he
tries
to
find
a
ground
of
reality
below
the
abstractions
of
philosophy
as
one
bent
on
trying
all
things
by
their
congruity
with
human
experience
who
had
felt
the
hand
of
heloďse
and
looked
into
her
eyes
and
tested
the
resources
of
humanity
in
her
great
and
energetic
nature
yet
it
is
only
a
little
later
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
french
prose
romance
begins
and
in
one
of
the
pretty
volumes
of
the
bibliothčque
elzevirienne
some
of
the
most
striking
fragments
of
it
may
be
found
edited
with
much
intelligence
in
one
of
these
stories
li
amitiez
de
ami
et
amile
that
free
play
of
human
affection
of
the
claims
of
which
abelard
story
is
an
assertion
makes
itself
felt
in
the
incidents
of
a
great
friendship
a
friendship
pure
and
generous
pushed
to
a
sort
of
passionate
exaltation
and
more
than
faithful
unto
death
such
comradeship
though
instances
of
it
are
to
be
found
everywhere
is
still
especially
a
classical
motive
chaucer
expressing
the
sentiment
of
it
so
strongly
in
an
antique
tale
that
one
knows
not
whether
the
love
of
both
palamon
and
arcite
for
emelya
or
of
those
two
for
each
other
is
the
chiefer
subject
of
the
tale
he
cast
his
eyen
upon
emelya
and
therewithal
he
bleynte
and
cried
ah
as
that
he
stongen
were
unto
the
herte
what
reader
does
not
refer
something
of
the
bitterness
of
that
cry
to
the
spoiling
already
foreseen
of
the
fair
friendship
which
had
made
the
prison
of
the
two
lads
sweet
hitherto
with
its
daily
offices
the
friendship
of
amis
and
amile
is
deepened
by
the
romantic
circumstance
of
an
entire
personal
resemblance
between
the
two
heroes
through
which
they
pass
for
each
other
again
and
again
and
thereby
into
many
strange
adventures
that
curious
interest
of
the
doppelgänger
which
begins
among
the
stars
with
the
dioscuri
being
entwined
in
and
out
through
all
the
incidents
of
the
story
like
an
outward
token
of
the
inward
similitude
of
their
souls
with
this
again
is
connected
like
a
second
reflection
of
that
inward
similitude
the
conceit
of
two
marvellously
beautiful
cups
also
exactly
like
each
other
children
cups
of
wood
but
adorned
with
gold
and
precious
stones
these
two
cups
which
by
their
resemblance
help
to
bring
the
friends
together
at
critical
moments
were
given
to
them
by
the
pope
when
he
baptized
them
at
rome
whither
the
parents
had
taken
them
for
that
purpose
in
gratitude
for
their
birth
they
cross
and
recross
very
strangely
in
the
narrative
serving
the
two
heroes
almost
like
living
things
and
with
that
effect
of
a
beautiful
object
kept
constantly
before
the
eye
in
a
story
or
poem
of
keeping
sensation
well
awake
and
giving
a
certain
air
of
refinement
to
all
the
scenes
into
which
it
enters
that
sense
of
fate
which
hangs
so
much
of
the
shaping
of
human
life
on
trivial
objects
like
othello
strawberry
handkerchief
is
thereby
heightened
while
witness
is
borne
to
the
enjoyment
of
beautiful
handiwork
by
primitive
people
their
simple
wonder
at
it
so
that
they
give
it
an
oddly
significant
place
among
the
factors
of
a
human
history
amis
and
amile
then
are
true
to
their
comradeship
through
all
trials
and
in
the
end
it
comes
to
pass
that
at
a
moment
of
great
need
amis
takes
the
place
of
amile
in
a
tournament
for
life
or
death
after
this
it
happened
that
a
leprosy
fell
upon
amis
so
that
his
wife
would
not
approach
him
and
wrought
to
strangle
him
he
departed
therefore
from
his
home
and
at
last
prayed
his
servants
to
carry
him
to
the
house
of
amile
and
it
is
in
what
follows
that
the
curious
strength
of
the
piece
shows
itself
his
servants
willing
to
do
as
he
commanded
carried
him
to
the
place
where
amile
was
and
they
began
to
sound
their
rattles
before
the
court
of
amile
house
as
lepers
are
accustomed
to
do
and
when
amile
heard
the
noise
he
commanded
one
of
his
servants
to
carry
meat
and
bread
to
the
sick
man
and
the
cup
which
was
given
to
him
at
rome
filled
with
good
wine
and
when
the
servant
had
done
as
he
was
commanded
he
returned
and
said
sir
if
i
had
not
thy
cup
in
my
hand
i
should
believe
that
the
cup
which
the
sick
man
has
was
thine
for
they
are
alike
the
one
to
the
other
in
height
and
fashion
and
amile
said
go
quickly
and
bring
him
to
me
and
when
amis
stood
before
his
comrade
amile
demanded
of
him
who
he
was
and
how
he
had
gotten
that
cup
i
am
of
briquain
le
chastel
answered
amis
and
the
cup
was
given
to
me
by
the
bishop
of
rome
who
baptized
me
and
when
amile
heard
that
he
knew
that
it
was
his
comrade
amis
who
had
delivered
him
from
death
and
won
for
him
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
france
to
be
his
wife
and
straightway
he
fell
upon
him
and
began
weeping
greatly
and
kissed
him
and
when
his
wife
heard
that
she
ran
out
with
her
hair
in
disarray
weeping
and
distressed
exceedingly
for
she
remembered
that
it
was
he
who
had
slain
the
false
ardres
and
thereupon
they
placed
him
in
a
fair
bed
and
said
to
him
abide
with
us
until
god
will
be
accomplished
in
thee
for
all
we
have
is
at
thy
service
so
he
and
the
two
servants
abode
with
them
and
it
came
to
pass
one
night
when
amis
and
amile
lay
in
one
chamber
without
other
companions
that
god
sent
his
angel
raphael
to
amis
who
said
to
him
amis
art
thou
asleep
and
he
supposing
that
amile
had
called
him
answered
and
said
i
am
not
asleep
fair
comrade
and
the
angel
said
to
him
thou
hast
answered
well
for
thou
art
the
comrade
of
the
heavenly
am
raphael
the
angel
of
our
lord
and
am
come
to
tell
thee
how
thou
mayest
be
healed
for
thy
prayers
are
heard
thou
shalt
bid
amile
thy
comrade
that
he
slay
his
two
children
and
wash
thee
in
their
blood
and
so
thy
body
shall
be
made
whole
and
amis
said
to
him
let
not
this
thing
be
that
my
comrade
should
become
a
murderer
for
my
sake
but
the
angel
said
it
is
convenient
that
he
do
this
and
thereupon
the
angel
departed
and
amile
also
as
if
in
sleep
heard
those
words
and
he
awoke
and
said
who
is
it
my
comrade
that
hath
spoken
with
thee
and
amis
answered
no
man
only
i
have
prayed
to
our
lord
as
i
am
accustomed
and
amile
said
not
so
but
some
one
hath
spoken
with
thee
then
he
arose
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
finding
it
shut
he
said
tell
me
my
brother
who
it
was
said
those
words
to
thee
and
amis
began
to
weep
greatly
and
told
him
that
it
was
raphael
the
angel
of
the
lord
who
had
said
to
him
amis
our
lord
commands
thee
that
thou
bid
amile
slay
his
two
children
and
wash
thee
in
their
blood
and
so
thou
shalt
be
healed
of
thy
leprosy
and
amile
was
greatly
disturbed
at
those
words
and
said
i
would
have
given
to
thee
my
and
my
and
all
my
goods
and
thou
feignest
that
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
thee
that
i
should
slay
my
two
children
and
immediately
amis
began
to
weep
and
said
i
know
that
i
have
spoken
to
thee
a
terrible
thing
but
constrained
thereto
i
pray
thee
cast
me
not
away
from
the
shelter
of
thy
house
and
amile
answered
that
what
he
had
covenanted
with
him
that
he
would
perform
unto
the
hour
of
his
death
but
i
conjure
thee
said
he
by
the
faith
which
there
is
between
me
and
thee
and
by
our
comradeship
and
by
the
baptism
we
received
together
at
rome
that
thou
tell
me
whether
it
was
man
or
angel
said
that
to
thee
and
amis
answered
again
so
truly
as
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
me
this
night
so
may
god
deliver
me
from
my
infirmity
then
amile
began
to
weep
in
secret
and
thought
within
himself
if
this
man
was
ready
to
die
before
the
king
for
me
shall
i
not
for
him
slay
my
children
shall
i
not
keep
faith
with
him
who
was
faithful
to
me
even
unto
death
and
amile
tarried
no
longer
but
departed
to
the
chamber
of
his
wife
and
bade
her
go
hear
the
sacred
office
and
he
took
a
sword
and
went
to
the
bed
where
the
children
were
lying
and
found
them
asleep
and
he
lay
down
over
them
and
began
to
weep
bitterly
and
said
hath
any
man
yet
heard
of
a
father
who
of
his
own
will
slew
his
children
alas
my
children
i
am
no
longer
your
father
but
your
cruel
murderer
and
the
children
awoke
at
the
tears
of
their
father
which
fell
upon
them
and
they
looked
up
into
his
face
and
began
to
laugh
and
as
they
were
of
the
age
of
about
three
years
he
said
your
laughing
will
be
turned
into
tears
for
your
innocent
blood
must
now
be
shed
and
therewith
he
cut
off
their
heads
then
he
laid
them
back
in
the
bed
and
put
the
heads
upon
the
bodies
and
covered
them
as
though
they
slept
and
with
the
blood
which
he
had
taken
he
washed
his
comrade
and
said
lord
jesus
christ
who
hast
commanded
men
to
keep
faith
on
earth
and
didst
heal
the
leper
by
thy
word
cleanse
now
my
comrade
for
whose
love
i
have
shed
the
blood
of
my
children
then
amis
was
cleansed
of
his
leprosy
and
amile
clothed
his
companion
in
his
best
robes
and
as
they
went
to
the
church
to
give
thanks
the
bells
by
the
will
of
god
rang
of
their
own
accord
and
when
the
people
of
the
city
heard
that
they
ran
together
to
see
the
marvel
and
the
wife
of
amile
when
she
saw
amis
and
amile
coming
asked
which
of
the
twain
was
her
husband
and
said
i
know
well
the
vesture
of
them
both
but
i
know
not
which
of
them
is
amile
and
amile
said
to
her
i
am
amile
and
my
companion
is
amis
who
is
healed
of
his
sickness
and
she
was
full
of
wonder
and
desired
to
know
in
what
manner
he
was
healed
give
thanks
to
our
lord
answered
amile
but
trouble
not
thyself
as
to
the
manner
of
the
healing
now
neither
the
father
nor
the
mother
had
yet
entered
where
the
children
were
but
the
father
sighed
heavily
because
they
were
dead
and
the
mother
asked
for
them
that
they
might
rejoice
together
but
amile
said
dame
let
the
children
sleep
and
it
was
already
the
hour
of
tierce
and
going
in
alone
to
the
children
to
weep
over
them
he
found
them
at
play
in
the
bed
only
in
the
place
of
the
about
their
throats
was
as
it
were
a
thread
of
crimson
and
he
took
them
in
his
arms
and
carried
them
to
his
wife
and
said
rejoice
greatly
for
thy
children
whom
i
had
slain
by
the
commandment
of
the
angel
are
alive
and
by
their
blood
is
amis
healed
there
as
i
said
is
the
strength
of
the
old
french
story
for
the
renaissance
has
not
only
the
sweetness
which
it
derives
from
the
classical
world
but
also
that
curious
strength
of
which
there
are
great
resources
in
the
true
middle
age
and
as
i
have
illustrated
the
early
strength
of
the
renaissance
by
the
story
of
amis
and
amile
a
story
which
comes
from
the
north
in
which
a
certain
racy
teutonic
flavour
is
perceptible
so
i
shall
illustrate
that
other
element
its
early
sweetness
a
languid
excess
of
sweetness
even
by
another
story
printed
in
the
same
volume
of
the
bibliothčque
elzevirienne
and
of
about
the
same
date
a
story
which
comes
characteristically
from
the
south
and
connects
itself
with
the
literature
of
provence
the
central
of
provence
the
poetry
of
the
tenson
and
the
aubade
of
bernard
de
ventadour
and
pierre
vidal
is
poetry
for
the
few
for
the
elect
and
peculiar
people
of
the
kingdom
of
sentiment
but
below
this
intenser
poetry
there
was
probably
a
wide
range
of
literature
less
serious
and
elevated
reaching
by
lightness
of
form
and
comparative
homeliness
of
interest
an
audience
which
the
concentrated
passion
of
those
higher
lyrics
left
untouched
this
literature
has
long
since
perished
or
lives
only
in
later
french
or
italian
versions
one
such
version
the
only
representative
of
its
species
fauriel
thought
he
detected
in
the
story
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
written
in
the
french
of
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
preserved
in
a
unique
manuscript
in
the
national
library
of
paris
and
there
were
reasons
which
made
him
divine
for
it
a
still
more
ancient
ancestry
traces
in
it
of
an
arabian
origin
as
in
a
leaf
lost
out
of
some
early
arabian
nights
the
little
book
loses
none
of
its
interest
through
the
criticism
which
finds
in
it
only
a
traditional
subject
handed
on
by
one
people
to
another
for
after
passing
thus
from
hand
to
hand
its
outline
is
still
clear
its
surface
untarnished
and
like
many
other
stories
books
literary
and
artistic
conceptions
of
the
middle
age
it
has
come
to
have
in
this
way
a
sort
of
personal
history
almost
as
full
of
risk
and
adventure
as
that
of
its
own
heroes
the
writer
himself
calls
the
piece
a
cantefable
a
tale
told
in
prose
but
with
its
incidents
and
sentiment
helped
forward
by
songs
inserted
at
irregular
intervals
in
the
junctions
of
the
story
itself
there
are
signs
of
roughness
and
want
of
skill
which
make
one
suspect
that
the
prose
was
only
put
together
to
connect
a
series
of
songs
a
series
of
songs
so
moving
and
attractive
that
people
wished
to
heighten
and
dignify
their
effect
by
a
regular
framework
or
setting
yet
the
songs
themselves
are
of
the
simplest
kind
not
rhymed
even
but
only
imperfectly
assonant
stanzas
of
twenty
or
thirty
lines
apiece
all
ending
with
a
similar
vowel
sound
and
here
as
elsewhere
in
that
early
poetry
much
of
the
interest
lies
in
the
spectacle
of
the
formation
of
a
new
artistic
sense
a
novel
art
is
arising
the
music
of
rhymed
poetry
and
in
the
songs
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
which
seem
always
on
the
point
of
passing
into
true
rhyme
but
which
halt
somehow
and
can
never
quite
take
flight
you
see
people
just
growing
aware
of
the
elements
of
a
new
music
in
their
possession
and
anticipating
how
pleasant
such
music
might
become
the
piece
was
probably
intended
to
be
recited
by
a
company
of
trained
performers
many
of
whom
at
least
for
the
lesser
parts
were
probably
children
the
songs
are
introduced
by
the
rubric
or
se
cante
ici
on
chante
and
each
division
of
prose
by
the
rubric
or
dient
et
content
et
fabloient
ici
on
conte
the
musical
notes
of
a
portion
of
the
songs
have
been
preserved
and
some
of
the
details
are
so
descriptive
that
they
suggested
to
fauriel
the
notion
that
the
words
had
been
accompanied
throughout
by
dramatic
action
that
mixture
of
simplicity
and
refinement
which
he
was
surprised
to
find
in
a
composition
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
shown
sometimes
in
the
turn
given
to
some
passing
expression
or
remark
thus
the
count
de
garins
was
old
and
frail
his
time
was
over
li
quens

and
then
all
is
so
realised
one
sees
the
ancient
forest
with
its
disused
roads
grown
deep
with
grass
and
the
place
where
seven
roads
meet
u
a
forkeut
set
cemin

we
hear
the
hearted
country
people
calling
each
other
by
their
rustic
names
and
putting
forward
as
their
spokesman
one
among
them
who
is
more
eloquent
and
ready
than
the
rest
li
un

for
the
little
book
has
its
burlesque
element
also
so
that
one
hears
the
faint
laughter
still
rough
as
it
is
the
piece
certainly
possesses
this
high
quality
of
poetry
that
it
aims
at
a
purely
artistic
effect
its
subject
is
a
great
sorrow
yet
it
claims
to
be
a
thing
of
joy
and
refreshment
to
be
entertained
not
for
its
matter
only
but
chiefly
for
its
manner
it
is
cortois
it
tells
us
et
bien
assis
for
the
student
of
manners
and
of
the
old
french
language
and
literature
it
has
much
interest
of
a
purely
antiquarian
order
to
say
of
an
ancient
literary
composition
that
it
has
an
antiquarian
interest
often
means
that
it
has
no
distinct
aesthetic
interest
for
the
reader
of
antiquarianism
by
a
purely
historical
effort
by
putting
its
object
in
perspective
and
setting
the
reader
in
a
certain
point
of
view
from
which
what
gave
pleasure
to
the
past
is
pleasurable
for
him
also
may
often
add
greatly
to
the
charm
we
receive
from
ancient
literature
but
the
first
condition
of
such
aid
must
be
a
real
direct
aesthetic
charm
in
the
thing
itself
unless
it
has
that
charm
unless
some
purely
artistic
quality
went
to
its
original
making
no
merely
antiquarian
effort
can
ever
give
it
an
aesthetic
value
or
make
it
a
proper
subject
of
aesthetic
criticism
this
quality
wherever
it
exists
it
is
always
pleasant
to
define
and
discriminate
from
the
sort
of
borrowed
interest
which
an
old
play
or
an
old
story
may
very
likely
acquire
through
a
true
antiquarianism
the
story
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
has
something
of
this
quality
aucassin
the
only
son
of
count
garins
of
beaucaire
is
passionately
in
love
with
nicolette
a
beautiful
girl
of
unknown
parentage
bought
of
the
saracens
whom
his
father
will
not
permit
him
to
marry
the
story
turns
on
the
adventures
of
these
two
lovers
until
at
the
end
of
the
piece
their
mutual
fidelity
is
rewarded
these
adventures
are
of
the
simplest
sort
adventures
which
seem
to
be
chosen
for
the
happy
occasion
they
afford
of
keeping
the
eye
of
the
fancy
perhaps
the
outward
eye
fixed
on
pleasant
objects
a
garden
a
ruined
tower
the
little
hut
of
flowers
which
nicolette
constructs
in
the
forest
whither
she
escapes
from
her
enemies
as
a
token
to
aucassin
that
she
has
passed
that
way
all
the
charm
of
the
piece
is
in
its
details
in
a
turn
of
peculiar
lightness
and
grace
given
to
the
situations
and
traits
of
sentiment
especially
in
its
quaint
fragments
of
early
french
prose
all
through
it
one
feels
the
influence
of
that
faint
air
of
overwrought
delicacy
almost
of
wantonness
which
was
so
strong
a
characteristic
of
the
poetry
of
the
troubadours
the
troubadours
themselves
were
often
men
of
great
rank
they
wrote
for
an
exclusive
audience
people
of
much
leisure
and
great
refinement
and
they
came
to
value
a
type
of
personal
beauty
which
has
in
it
but
little
of
the
influence
of
the
open
air
and
sunshine
there
is
a
languid
eastern
deliciousness
in
the
very
scenery
of
the
story
the
roses
the
chamber
painted
in
some
mysterious
manner
where
nicolette
is
imprisoned
the
cool
brown
marble
the
almost
nameless
colours
the
odour
of
plucked
grass
and
flowers
nicolette
herself
well
becomes
this
scenery
and
is
the
best
illustration
of
the
quality
i
mean
the
beautiful
weird
foreign
girl
whom
the
shepherds
take
for
a
fay
who
has
the
knowledge
of
simples
the
healing
and
beautifying
qualities
of
leaves
and
flowers
whose
skilful
touch
heals
aucassin
sprained
shoulder
so
that
he
suddenly
leaps
from
the
ground
the
mere
sight
of
whose
white
flesh
as
she
passed
the
place
where
he
lay
healed
a
pilgrim
stricken
with
sore
disease
so
that
he
rose
up
and
returned
to
his
own
country
with
this
girl
aucassin
is
so
deeply
in
love
that
he
forgets
all
knightly
duties
at
last
nicolette
is
shut
up
to
get
her
out
of
his
way
and
perhaps
the
prettiest
passage
in
the
whole
piece
is
the
fragment
of
prose
which
describes
her
escape
aucassin
was
put
in
prison
as
you
have
heard
and
nicolette
remained
shut
up
in
her
chamber
it
was
in
the
month
of
may
when
the
days
are
warm
and
long
and
clear
and
the
nights
coy
and
serene
one
night
nicolette
lying
on
her
bed
saw
the
moon
shine
clear
through
the
little
window
and
heard
the
nightingale
sing
in
the
garden
and
then
came
the
memory
of
aucassin
whom
she
so
much
loved
she
thought
of
the
count
garins
of
beaucaire
who
mortally
hated
her
and
to
be
rid
of
her
might
at
any
moment
cause
her
to
be
burned
or
drowned
she
perceived
that
the
old
woman
who
kept
her
company
was
asleep
she
rose
and
put
on
the
fairest
gown
she
had
she
took
the
and
the
towels
and
knotted
them
together
like
a
cord
as
far
as
they
would
go
then
she
tied
the
end
to
a
pillar
of
the
window
and
let
herself
slip
down
quite
softly
into
the
garden
and
passed
straight
across
it
to
reach
the
town
her
hair
was
yellow
in
small
curls
her
smiling
eyes
her
face
clear
and
feat
the
little
lips
very
red
the
teeth
small
and
white
and
the
daisies
which
she
crushed
in
passing
holding
her
skirt
high
behind
and
before
looked
dark
against
her
feet
the
girl
was
so
white
she
came
to
the
and
opened
it
and
walked
through
the
streets
of
beaucaire
keeping
on
the
dark
side
of
the
way
to
be
out
of
the
light
of
the
moon
which
shone
quietly
in
the
sky
she
walked
as
fast
as
she
could
until
she
came
to
the
tower
where
aucassin
was
the
tower
was
set
about
with
pillars
here
and
there
she
pressed
herself
against
one
of
the
pillars
wrapped
herself
closely
in
her
mantle
and
putting
her
face
to
a
chink
of
the
tower
which
was
old
and
ruined
she
heard
aucassin
crying
bitterly
within
and
when
she
had
listened
awhile
she
began
to
speak
but
scattered
up
and
down
through
this
lighter
matter
always
tinged
with
humour
and
often
passing
into
burlesque
which
makes
up
the
general
substance
of
the
piece
there
are
morsels
of
a
different
quality
touches
of
some
intenser
sentiment
coming
it
would
seem
from
the
profound
and
energetic
spirit
of
the
provençal
poetry
itself
to
which
the
inspiration
of
the
book
has
been
referred
let
me
gather
up
these
morsels
of
deeper
colour
these
expressions
of
the
ideal
intensity
of
love
the
motive
which
really
unites
together
the
fragments
of
the
little
composition
dante
the
perfect
flower
of
ideal
love
has
recorded
how
the
tyranny
of
that
lord
of
terrible
aspect
became
actually
physical
blinding
his
senses
and
suspending
his
bodily
forces
in
this
dante
is
but
the
central
expression
and
type
of
experiences
known
well
enough
to
the
initiated
in
that
passionate
age
aucassin
represents
this
ideal
intensity
of
passion
aucassin
le
biax
li
blons
li
gentix
li
amorous
the
slim
tall
debonair
dansellon
as
the
singers
call
him
with
his
curled
yellow
hair
and
eyes
of
vair
who
faints
with
love
as
dante
fainted
who
rides
all
day
through
the
forest
in
search
of
nicolette
while
the
thorns
tear
his
flesh
so
that
one
might
have
traced
him
by
the
blood
upon
the
grass
and
who
weeps
at
eventide
because
he
has
not
found
her
who
has
the
malady
of
his
love
and
neglects
all
knightly
duties
once
he
is
induced
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
people
that
they
seeing
him
before
them
might
have
more
heart
to
defend
themselves
then
a
song
relates
how
the
sweet
grave
figure
goes
forth
to
battle
in
dainty
armour
it
is
the
very
image
of
the
provençal
no
longer
a
child
but
grown
to
pensive
youth
as
pierre
vidal
met
him
riding
on
a
white
horse
fair
as
the
morning
his
vestment
embroidered
with
flowers
he
rode
on
through
the
gates
into
the
open
plain
beyond
but
as
he
went
that
great
malady
of
his
love
came
upon
him
the
bridle
fell
from
his
hands
and
like
one
who
sleeps
walking
he
was
carried
on
into
the
midst
of
his
enemies
and
heard
them
talking
together
how
they
might
most
conveniently
kill
him
one
of
the
strongest
characteristics
of
that
outbreak
of
the
reason
and
the
imagination
of
that
assertion
of
the
liberty
of
the
heart
in
the
middle
age
which
i
have
termed
a
medieval
renaissance
was
its
antinomianism
its
spirit
of
rebellion
and
revolt
against
the
moral
and
religious
ideas
of
the
time
in
their
search
after
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
and
the
imagination
in
their
care
for
beauty
in
their
worship
of
the
body
people
were
impelled
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
christian
ideal
and
their
love
became
sometimes
a
strange
idolatry
a
strange
rival
religion
it
was
the
return
of
that
ancient
venus
not
dead
but
only
hidden
for
a
time
in
the
caves
of
the
venusberg
of
those
old
pagan
gods
still
going
to
and
fro
on
the
earth
under
all
sorts
of
disguises
and
this
element
in
the
middle
age
for
the
most
part
ignored
by
those
writers
who
have
treated
it
as
the
age
of
faith
this
rebellious
and
antinomian
element
the
recognition
of
which
has
made
the
delineation
of
the
middle
age
by
the
writers
of
the
romantic
school
in
france
by
victor
hugo
for
instance
in
de
paris
so
suggestive
and
exciting
is
found
alike
in
the
history
of
abelard
and
the
legend
of
tannhäuser
more
and
more
as
we
come
to
mark
changes
and
distinctions
of
temper
in
what
is
often
in
one
confusion
called
the
middle
age
that
rebellion
that
sinister
claim
for
liberty
of
heart
and
thought
comes
to
the
surface
the
albigensian
movement
connected

franciscan
order
with
its
poetry
its
mysticism
its
illumination
from
the

justly
suspect
it
influences
the
thoughts
of
those
obscure
prophetical
writers
like
joachim

strange

in

world
of

away
of
this
spirit
aucassin
and
nicolette
contains
perhaps
the
most
famous
expression
it
is
the
answer
aucassin
gives
when
he
is
threatened
with
the
pains
of
hell
if
he
makes
nicolette
his
mistress
a
creature
wholly
of
affection
and
the
senses
he
sees
on
the
way
to
paradise
only
a
feeble
and
out
company
of
aged
priests
clinging
day
and
night
to
the
chapel
altars
barefoot
or
in
patched
sandals
with
or
even
without
nicolette
his
sweet
mistress
whom
he
so
much
loves
he
for
his
part
is
ready
to
start
on
the
way
to
hell
along
with
the
good
scholars
as
he
says
and
the
actors
and
the
fine
horsemen
dead
in
battle
and
the
men
of
fashion
and
the
fair
courteous
ladies
who
had
two
or
three
chevaliers
apiece
beside
their
own
true
lords
all
gay
with
music
in
their
gold
and
silver
and
beautiful
furs
the
vair
and
the
grey
but
in
the
house
beautiful
the
saints
too
have
their
place
and
the
student
of
the
renaissance
has
this
advantage
over
the
student
of
the
emancipation
of
the
human
mind
in
the
reformation
or
the
french
revolution
that
in
tracing
the
footsteps
of
humanity
to
higher
levels
he
is
not
beset
at
every
turn
by
the
inflexibilities
and
antagonisms
of
some
controversy
with
rigidly
defined
opposites
exhausting
the
intelligence
and
limiting
one
sympathies
the
opposition
of
the
professional
defenders
of
a
mere
system
to
that
more
sincere
and
generous
play
of
the
forces
of
human
mind
and
character
which
i
have
noted
as
the
secret
of
abelard
struggle
is
indeed
always
powerful
but
the
incompatibility
with
one
another
of
souls
really
fair
is
not
essential
and
within
the
enchanted
region
of
the
renaissance
one
needs
not
be
for
ever
on
one
guard
here
there
are
no
fixed
parties
no
exclusions
all
breathes
of
that
unity
of
culture
in
which
whatsoever
things
are
comely
are
reconciled
for
the
elevation
and
adorning
of
our
spirits
and
just
in
proportion
as
those
who
took
part
in
the
renaissance
become
centrally
representative
of
it
just
so
much
the
more
is
this
condition
realised
in
them
the
wicked
popes
and
the
loveless
tyrants
who
from
time
to
time
became
its
patrons
or
mere
speculators
in
its
fortunes
lend
themselves
easily
to
disputations
and
from
this
side
or
that
the
spirit
of
controversy
lays
just
hold
upon
them
but
the
painter
of
the
last
supper
with
his
kindred
lives
in
a
land
where
controversy
has
no
they
refuse
to
be
classified
in
the
story
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
in
the
literature
which
it
represents
the
note
of
defiance
of
the
opposition
of
one
system
to
another
is
sometimes
harsh
let
me
conclude
then
with
a
morsel
from
amis
and
amile
in
which
the
harmony
of
human
interests
is
still
entire
for
the
story
of
the
great
traditional
friendship
in
which
as
i
said
the
liberty
of
the
heart
makes
itself
felt
seems
as
we
have
it
to
have
been
written
by
a
monk
la
vie
des
saints
martyrs
amis
et
amile
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
their
names
were
finally
excluded
from
the
martyrology
and
their
story
ends
with
this
monkish
miracle
of
earthly
comradeship
more
than
faithful
unto
death
for
as
god
had
united
them
in
their
lives
in
one
accord
so
they
were
not
divided
in
their
death
falling
together
side
by
side
with
a
host
of
other
brave
men
in
battle
for
king
charles
at
mortara
so
called
from
that
great
slaughter
and
the
bishops
gave
counsel
to
the
king
and
queen
that
they
should
bury
the
dead
and
build
a
church
in
that
place
and
their
counsel
pleased
the
king
greatly
and
there
were
built
two
churches
the
one
by
commandment
of
the
king
in
honour
of
saint
oseige
and
the
other
by
commandment
of
the
queen
in
honour
of
saint
peter
and
the
king
caused
the
two
chests
of
stone
to
be
brought
in
the
which
the
bodies
of
amis
and
amile
lay
and
amile
was
carried
to
the
church
of
saint
peter
and
amis
to
the
church
of
saint
oseige
and
the
other
corpses
were
buried
some
in
one
place
and
some
in
the
other
but
lo
next
morning
the
body
of
amile
in
his
coffin
was
found
lying
in
the
church
of
saint
oseige
beside
the
coffin
of
amis
his
comrade
behold
then
this
wondrous
amity
which
by
death
could
not
be
dissevered
this
miracle
god
did
who
gave
to
his
disciples
power
to
remove
mountains
and
by
reason
of
this
miracle
the
king
and
queen
remained
in
that
place
for
a
space
of
thirty
days
and
performed
the
offices
of
the
dead
who
were
slain
and
honoured
the
said
churches
with
great
gifts
and
the
bishop
ordained
many
clerks
to
serve
in
the
church
of

them
that

should

no
account
of
the
renaissance
can
be
complete
without
some
notice
of
the
attempt
made
by
certain
italian
scholars
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
reconcile
christianity
with
the
religion
of
ancient
greece
to
reconcile
forms
of
sentiment
which
at
first
sight
seem
incompatible
to
adjust
the
various
products
of
the
human
mind
to
one
another
in
one
type
of
intellectual
culture
to
give
humanity
for
heart
and
imagination
to
feed
upon
as
much
as
it
could
possibly
receive
belonged
to
the
generous
instincts
of
that
age
an
earlier
and
simpler
generation
had
seen
in
the
gods
of
greece
so
many
malignant
spirits
the
defeated
but
still
living
centres
of
the
religion
of
darkness
struggling
not
always
in
vain
against
the
kingdom
of
light
little
by
little
as
the
natural
charm
of
pagan
story
reasserted
itself
over
minds
emerging
out
of
barbarism
the
religious
significance
which
had
once
belonged
to
it
was
lost
sight
of
and
it
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
subject
of
a
purely
artistic
or
poetical
treatment
but
it
was
inevitable
that
from
time
to
time
minds
should
arise
deeply
enough
impressed
by
its
beauty
and
power
to
ask
themselves
whether
the
religion
of
greece
was
indeed
a
rival
of
the
religion
of
christ
for
the
older
gods
had
rehabilitated
themselves
and
men
allegiance
was
divided
and
the
fifteenth
century
was
an
impassioned
age
so
ardent
and
serious
in
its
pursuit
of
art
that
it
consecrated
everything
with
which
art
had
to
do
as
a
religious
object
the
restored
greek
literature
had
made
it
familiar
at
least
in
plato
with
a
style
of
expression
concerning
the
earlier
gods
which
had
about
it
something
of
the
warmth
and
unction
of
a
christian
hymn
it
was
too
familiar
with
such
language
to
regard
mythology
as
a
mere
story
and
it
was
too
serious
to
play
with
a
religion
let
me
briefly
remind
the
reader
says
heine
in
the
gods
in
exile
an
essay
full
of
that
strange
blending
of
sentiment
which
is
characteristic
of
the
traditions
of
the
middle
age
concerning
the
pagan
religions
how
the
gods
of
the
older
world
at
the
time
of
the
definite
triumph
of
christianity
that
is
in
the
third
century
fell
into
painful
embarrassments
which
greatly
resembled
certain
tragical
situations
of
their
earlier
life
they
now
found
themselves
beset
by
the
same
troublesome
necessities
to
which
they
had
once
before
been
exposed
during
the
primitive
ages
in
that
revolutionary
epoch
when
the
titans
broke
out
of
the
custody
of
orcus
and
piling
pelion
on
ossa
scaled
olympus
unfortunate
gods
they
had
then
to
take
flight
ignominiously
and
hide
themselves
among
us
here
on
earth
under
all
sorts
of
disguises
the
larger
number
betook
themselves
to
egypt
where
for
greater
security
they
assumed
the
forms
of
animals
as
is
generally
known
just
in
the
same
way
they
had
to
take
flight
again
and
seek
entertainment
in
remote
when
those
iconoclastic
zealots
the
black
brood
of
monks
broke
down
all
the
temples
and
pursued
the
gods
with
fire
and
curses
many
of
these
unfortunate
emigrants
now
entirely
deprived
of
shelter
and
ambrosia
must
needs
take
to
vulgar
handicrafts
as
a
means
of
earning
their
bread
under
these
circumstances
many
whose
sacred
groves
had
been
confiscated
let
themselves
out
for
hire
as
in
germany
and
were
forced
to
drink
beer
instead
of
nectar
apollo
seems
to
have
been
content
to
take
service
under
graziers
and
as
he
had
once
kept
the
cows
of
admetus
so
he
lived
now
as
a
shepherd
in
lower
austria
here
however
having
become
suspected
on
account
of
his
beautiful
singing
he
was
recognised
by
a
learned
monk
as
one
of
the
old
pagan
gods
and
handed
over
to
the
spiritual
tribunal
on
the
rack
he
confessed
that
he
was
the
god
apollo
and
before
his
execution
he
begged
that
he
might
be
suffered
to
play
once
more
upon
the
lyre
and
to
sing
a
song
and
he
played
so
touchingly
and
sang
with
such
magic
and
was
withal
so
beautiful
in
form
and
feature
that
all
the
women
wept
and
many
of
them
were
so
deeply
impressed
that
they
shortly
afterwards
fell
sick
some
time
afterwards
the
people
wished
to
drag
him
from
the
grave
again
that
a
stake
might
be
driven
through
his
body
in
the
belief
that
he
had
been
a
vampire
and
that
the
sick
women
would
by
this
means
recover
but
they
found
the
grave
empty
the
renaissance
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
in
many
things
great
rather
by
what
it
designed
than
by
what
it
achieved
much
which
it
aspired
to
do
and
did
but
imperfectly
or
mistakenly
was
accomplished
in
what
is
called
the
éclaircissement
of
the
eighteenth
century
or
in
our
own
generation
and
what
really
belongs
to
the
revival
of
the
fifteenth
century
is
but
the
leading
instinct
the
curiosity
the
initiatory
idea
it
is
so
with
this
very
question
of
the
reconciliation
of
the
religion
of
antiquity
with
the
religion
of
christ
a
modern
scholar
occupied
by
this
problem
might
observe
that
all
religions
may
be
regarded
as
natural
products
that
at
least
in
their
origin
their
growth
and
decay
they
have
common
laws
and
are
not
to
be
isolated
from
the
other
movements
of
the
human
mind
in
the
periods
in
which
they
respectively
prevailed
that
they
arise
spontaneously
out
of
the
human
mind
as
expressions
of
the
varying
phases
of
its
sentiment
concerning
the
unseen
world
that
every
intellectual
product
must
be
judged
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
age
and
the
people
in
which
it
was
produced
he
might
go
on
to
observe
that
each
has
contributed
something
to
the
development
of
the
religious
sense
and
ranging
them
as
so
many
stages
in
the
gradual
education
of
the
human
mind
justify
the
existence
of
each
the
basis
of
the
reconciliation
of
the
religions
of
the
world
would
thus
be
the
inexhaustible
activity
and
creativeness
of
the
human
mind
itself
in
which
all
religions
alike
have
their
root
and
in
which
all
alike
are
reconciled
just
as
the
fancies
of
childhood
and
the
thoughts
of
old
age
meet
and
are
laid
to
rest
in
the
experience
of
the
individual
far
different
was
the
method
followed
by
the
scholars
of
the
fifteenth
century
they
lacked
the
very
rudiments
of
the
historic
sense
which
by
an
imaginative
act
throws
itself
back
into
a
world
unlike
one
own
and
estimates
every
intellectual
creation
in
its
connexion
with
the
age
from
which
it
proceeded
they
had
no
idea
of
development
of
the
differences
of
ages
of
the
process
by
which
our
race
has
been
educated
in
their
attempts
to
reconcile
the
religions
of
the
world
they
were
thus
thrown
back
upon
the
quicksand
of
allegorical
interpretation
the
religions
of
the
world
were
to
be
reconciled
not
as
successive
stages
in
a
regular
development
of
the
religious
sense
but
as
subsisting
side
by
side
and
substantially
in
agreement
with
one
another
and
here
the
first
necessity
was
to
misrepresent
the
language
the
conceptions
the
sentiments
it
was
proposed
to
compare
and
reconcile
plato
and
homer
must
be
made
to
speak
agreeably
to
moses
set
side
by
side
the
mere
surfaces
could
never
unite
in
any
harmony
of
design
therefore
one
must
go
below
the
surface
and
bring
up
the
supposed
secondary
or
still
more
remote
meaning
that
diviner
signification
held
in
reserve
in
recessu
divinius
aliquid
latent
in
some
stray
touch
of
homer
or
figure
of
speech
in
the
books
of
moses
and
yet
as
a
curiosity
of
the
human
mind
a
if
you
will
into
which
we
may
peep
for
a
moment
and
see
it
at
work
weaving
strange
fancies
the
allegorical
interpretation
of
the
fifteenth
century
has
its
interest
with
its
strange
web
of
imagery
its
quaint
conceits
its
unexpected
combinations
and
subtle
moralising
it
is
an
element
in
the
local
colour
of
a
great
age
it
illustrates
also
the
faith
of
that
age
in
all
oracles
its
desire
to
hear
all
voices
its
generous
belief
that
nothing
which
had
ever
interested
the
human
mind
could
wholly
lose
its
vitality
it
is
the
counterpart
though
certainly
the
feebler
counterpart
of
that
practical
truce
and
reconciliation
of
the
gods
of
greece
with
the
christian
religion
which
is
seen
in
the
art
of
the
time
and
it
is
for
his
share
in
this
work
and
because
his
own
story
is
a
sort
of
analogue
or
visible
equivalent
to
the
expression
of
this
purpose
in
his
writings
that
something
of
a
general
interest
still
belongs
to
the
name
of
pico
della
mirandola
whose
life
written
by
his
nephew
francis
seemed
worthy
for
some
touch
of
sweetness
in
it
to
be
translated
out
of
the
original
latin
by
sir
thomas
more
that
great
lover
of
italian
culture
among
whose
works
the
life
of
pico
earl
of
mirandola
and
a
great
lord
of
italy
as
he
calls
him
may
still
be
read
in
its
quaint
antiquated
english
marsilio
ficino
has
told
us
how
pico
came
to
florence
it
was
the
very
day
some
day
probably
in
the
year
on
which
ficino
had
finished
his
famous
translation
of
plato
into
latin
the
work
to
which
he
had
been
dedicated
from
childhood
by
cosmo
de
medici
in
furtherance
of
his
desire
to
resuscitate
the
knowledge
of
plato
among
his
florence
indeed
as
renan
has
pointed
out
had
always
had
an
affinity
for
the
mystic
and
dreamy
philosophy
of
plato
while
the
colder
and
more
practical
philosophy
of
aristotle
had
flourished
in
padua
and
other
cities
of
the
north
and
the
florentines
though
they
knew
perhaps
very
little
about
him
had
had
the
name
of
the
great
idealist
often
on
their
lips
to
increase
this
knowledge
cosmo
had
founded
the
platonic
academy
with
periodical
discussions
at
the
villa
careggi
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
and
the
council
in
for
the
reconciliation
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
had
brought
to
florence
many
a
needy
greek
scholar
and
now
the
work
was
completed
the
door
of
the
mystical
temple
lay
open
to
all
who
could
construe
latin
and
the
scholar
rested
from
his
labour
when
there
was
introduced
into
his
study
where
a
lamp
burned
continually
before
the
bust
of
plato
as
other
men
burned
lamps
before
their
favourite
saints
a
young
man
fresh
from
a
journey
of
feature
and
shape
seemly
and
beauteous
of
stature
goodly
and
high
of
flesh
tender
and
soft
his
visage
lovely
and
fair
his
colour
white
intermingled
with
comely
reds
his
eyes
grey
and
quick
of
look
his
teeth
white
and
even
his
hair
yellow
and
abundant
and
trimmed
with
more
than
the
usual
artifice
of
the
time
it
is
thus
that
sir
thomas
more
translates
the
words
of
the
biographer
of
pico
who
even
in
outward
form
and
appearance
seems
an
image
of
that
inward
harmony
and
completeness
of
which
he
is
so
perfect
an
example
the
word
mystic
has
been
usually
derived
from
a
greek
word
which
signifies
to
shut
as
if
one
shut
one
lips
brooding
on
what
can
not
be
uttered
but
the
platonists
themselves
derive
it
rather
from
the
act
of
shutting
the
eyes
that
one
may
see
the
more
inwardly
perhaps
the
eyes
of
the
mystic
ficino
now
long
past
the
midway
of
life
had
come
to
be
thus
but
when
a
young
man
not
unlike
the
archangel
raphael
as
the
florentines
of
that
age
depicted
him
in
his
wonderful
walk
with
tobit
or
mercury
as
he
might
have
appeared
in
a
painting
by
sandro
botticelli
or
piero
di
cosimo
entered
his
chamber
he
seems
to
have
thought
there
was
something
not
wholly
earthly
about
him
at
least
he
ever
afterwards
believed
that
it
was
not
without
the
of
the
stars
that
the
stranger
had
arrived
on
that
day
for
it
happened
that
they
fell
into
a
conversation
deeper
and
more
intimate
than
men
usually
fall
into
at
first
sight
during
this
conversation
ficino
formed
the
design
of
devoting
his
remaining
years
to
the
translation
of
plotinus
that
new
plato
in
whom
the
mystical
element
in
the
platonic
philosophy
had
been
worked
out
to
the
utmost
limit
of
vision
and
ecstasy
and
it
is
in
dedicating
this
translation
to
lorenzo
de
medici
that
ficino
has
recorded
these
incidents
it
was
after
many
wanderings
wanderings
of
the
intellect
as
well
as
physical
journeys
that
pico
came
to
rest
at
florence
born
in
he
was
then
about
twenty
years
old
he
was
called
giovanni
at
baptism
pico
like
all
his
ancestors
from
picus
nephew
of
the
emperor
constantine
from
whom
they
claimed
to
be
descended
and
mirandola
from
the
place
of
his
birth
a
little
town
afterwards
part
of
the
duchy
of
modena
of
which
small
territory
his
family
had
long
been
the
feudal
lords
pico
was
the
youngest
of
the
family
and
his
mother
delighting
in
his
wonderful
memory
sent
him
at
the
age
of
fourteen
to
the
famous
school
of
law
at
bologna
from
the
first
indeed
she
seems
to
have
had
some
presentiment
of
his
future
fame
for
with
a
faith
in
omens
characteristic
of
her
time
she
believed
that
a
strange
circumstance
had
happened
at
the
time
of
pico
birth
the
appearance
of
a
circular
flame
which
suddenly
vanished
away
on
the
wall
of
the
chamber
where
she
lay
he
remained
two
years
at
bologna
and
then
with
an
inexhaustible
unrivalled
thirst
for
knowledge
the
strange
confused
uncritical
learning
of
that
age
passed
through
the
principal
schools
of
italy
and
france
penetrating
as
he
thought
into
the
secrets
of
all
ancient
philosophies
and
many
eastern
languages
and
with
this
flood
of
erudition
came
the
generous
hope
so
often
disabused
of
reconciling
the
philosophers
with
one
another
and
all
alike
with
the
church
at
last
he
came
to
rome
there
like
some
errant
of
philosophy
he
offered
to
defend
nine
hundred
bold
paradoxes
drawn
from
the
most
opposite
sources
against
all
comers
but
the
pontifical
court
was
led
to
suspect
the
orthodoxy
of
some
of
these
propositions
and
even
the
reading
of
the
book
which
contained
them
was
forbidden
by
the
pope
it
was
not
until
that
pico
was
finally
absolved
by
a
brief
of
alexander
the
sixth
ten
years
before
that
date
he
had
arrived
at
florence
an
early
instance
of
those
who
after
following
the
vain
hope
of
an
impossible
reconciliation
from
system
to
system
have
at
last
fallen
back
unsatisfied
on
the
simplicities
of
their
belief
the
oration
which
pico
composed
for
the
opening
of
this
philosophical
tournament
still
remains
its
subject
is
the
dignity
of
human
nature
the
greatness
of
man
in
common
with
nearly
all
medieval
speculation
much
of
pico
writing
has
this
for
its
drift
and
in
common
also
with
it
pico
theory
of
that
dignity
is
founded
on
a
misconception
of
the
place
in
nature
both
of
the
earth
and
of
man
for
pico
the
earth
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
around
it
as
a
fixed
and
motionless
point
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
revolve
like
diligent
servants
or
ministers
and
in
the
midst
of
all
is
placed
man
nodus
et
vinculum
mundi
the
bond
or
copula
of
the
world
and
the
interpreter
of
nature
that
famous
expression
of
bacon
really
belongs
to
pico
tritum

he
says
esse

et

coelestis
et
plantarum
anima
vegetalis
et
brutorum
sensus
et
ratio
et
angelica
mens
et
dei
similitudo
conspicitur
it
is
a
commonplace
of
the
schools
that
man
is
a
little
world
in
which
we
may
discern
a
body
mingled
of
earthy
elements
and
ethereal
breath
and
the
vegetable
life
of
plants
and
the
senses
of
the
lower
animals
and
reason
and
the
intelligence
of
angels
and
a
likeness
to
god
a
commonplace
of
the
schools
but
perhaps
it
had
some
new
significance
and
authority
when
men
heard
one
like
pico
reiterate
it
and
false
as
its
basis
was
the
theory
had
its
use
for
this
high
dignity
of
man
thus
bringing
the
dust
under
his
feet
into
sensible
communion
with
the
thoughts
and
affections
of
the
angels
was
supposed
to
belong
to
him
not
as
renewed
by
a
religious
system
but
by
his
own
natural
right
the
proclamation
of
it
was
a
counterpoise
to
the
increasing
tendency
of
medieval
religion
to
depreciate
man
nature
to
sacrifice
this
or
that
element
in
it
to
make
it
ashamed
of
itself
to
keep
the
degrading
or
painful
accidents
of
it
always
in
view
it
helped
man
onward
to
that
reassertion
of
himself
that
rehabilitation
of
human
nature
the
body
the
senses
the
heart
the
intelligence
which
the
renaissance
fulfils
and
yet
to
read
a
page
of
one
of
forgotten
books
is
like
a
glance
into
one
of
those
ancient
sepulchres
upon
which
the
wanderer
in
classical
lands
has
sometimes
stumbled
with
the
old
disused
ornaments
and
furniture
of
a
world
wholly
unlike
ours
still
fresh
in
them
that
whole
conception
of
nature
is
so
different
from
our
own
for
pico
the
world
is
a
limited
place
bounded
by
actual
crystal
walls
and
a
material
firmament
it
is
like
a
painted
toy
like
that
map
or
system
of
the
world
held
as
a
great
target
or
shield
in
the
hands
of
the
creative
logos
by
whom
the
father
made
all
things
in
one
of
the
earlier
frescoes
of
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
how
different
from
this
childish
dream
is
our
own
conception
of
nature
with
its
unlimited
space
its
innumerable
suns
and
the
earth
but
a
mote
in
the
beam
how
different
the
strange
new
awe
or
superstition
with
which
it
fills
our
minds
the
silence
of
those
infinite
spaces
says
pascal
contemplating
a
starlight
night
the
silence
of
those
infinite
spaces

he
was
already
almost
wearied
out
when
he
came
to
florence
he
had
loved
much
and
been
beloved
by
women
wandering
over
the
crooked
hills
of
delicious
pleasure
but
their
reign
over
him
was
over
and
long
before
savonarola
famous
bonfire
of
vanities
he
had
destroyed
those
in
the
vulgar
tongue
which
would
have
been
so
great
a
relief
to
us
after
the
scholastic
prolixity
of
his
latin
writings
it
was
in
another
spirit
that
he
composed
a
platonic
commentary
the
only
work
of
his
in
italian
which
has
come
down
to
us
on
the
song
of
divine
love
secondo
la
mente
ed
opinione
dei
platonici
according
to
the
mind
and
opinion
of
the
platonists
by
his
friend
hieronymo
beniveni
in
which
with
an
ambitious
array
of
every
sort
of
learning
and
a
profusion
of
imagery
borrowed
indifferently
from
the
astrologers
the
cabala
and
homer
and
scripture
and
dionysius
the
areopagite
he
attempts
to
define
the
stages
by
which
the
soul
passes
from
the
earthly
to
the
unseen
beauty
a
change
indeed
had
passed
over
him
as
if
the
chilling
touch
of
the
abstract
and
disembodied
beauty
platonists
profess
to
long
for
were
already
upon
him
some
sense
of
this
perhaps
coupled
with
that
which
in
the
popular
imagination
always
betokens
an
early
death
made
camilla
rucellai
one
of
those
prophetic
women
whom
the
preaching
of
savonarola
had
raised
up
in
florence
declare
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
would
depart
in
the
time
of
lilies
prematurely
that
is
like
the
which
are
withered
by
the
scorching
sun
almost
as
soon
as
they
are
sprung
up
he
now
wrote
down
those
thoughts
on
the
religious
life
which
sir
thomas
more
turned
into
english
and
which
another
english
translator
thought
worthy
to
be
added
to
the
books
of
the
imitation
it
is
not
hard
to
know
god
provided
one
will
not
force
oneself
to
define
him
has
been
thought
a
great
saying
of
joubert
love
god
pico
writes
to
angelo
politian
we
rather
may
than
either
know
him
or
by
speech
utter
him
and
yet
had
men
liefer
by
knowledge
never
find
that
which
they
seek
than
by
love
possess
that
thing
which
also
without
love
were
in
vain
found
yet
he
who
had
this
fine
touch
for
spiritual
things
did
not
and
in
this
is
the
enduring
interest
of
his
story
even
after
his
conversion
forget
the
old
gods
he
is
one
of
the
last
who
seriously
and
sincerely
entertained
the
claim
on
men
faith
of
the
pagan
religions
he
is
anxious
to
ascertain
the
true
significance
of
the
obscurest
legend
the
lightest
tradition
concerning
them
with
many
thoughts
and
many
influences
which
led
him
in
that
direction
he
did
not
become
a
monk
only
he
became
gentle
and
patient
in
disputation
retaining
somewhat
of
the
old
plenty
in
dainty
viand
and
silver
vessel
he
gave
over
the
greater
part
of
his
property
to
his
friend
the
mystical
poet
beniveni
to
be
spent
by
him
in
works
of
charity
chiefly
in
the
sweet
charity
of
providing
for
the
peasant
girls
of
florence
his
end
came
in
when
amid
the
prayers
and
sacraments
of
savonarola
he
died
of
fever
on
the
very
day
on
which
charles
the
eighth
entered
florence
the
seventeenth
of
november
yet
in
the
time
of
lilies
the
lilies
of
the
shield
of
france
as
the
people
now
said
remembering
prophecy
he
was
buried
in
the
conventual
church
of
saint
mark
in
the
hood
and
white
frock
of
the
dominican
order
it
is
because
the
life
of
pico
thus
lying
down
to
rest
in
the
dominican
habit
yet
amid
thoughts
of
the
older
gods
himself
like
one
of
those
comely
divinities
reconciled
indeed
to
the
new
religion
but
still
with
a
tenderness
for
the
earlier
life
and
desirous
literally
to
bind
the
ages
each
to
each
by
natural
piety
is
because
this
life
is
so
perfect
a
parallel
to
the
attempt
made
in
his
writings
to
reconcile
christianity
with
the
ideas
of
paganism
that
pico
in
spite
of
the
scholastic
character
of
those
writings
is
really
interesting
thus
in
the
heptaplus
or
discourse
on
the
seven
days
of
the
creation
he
endeavours
to
reconcile
the
accounts
which
pagan
philosophy
had
given
of
the
origin
of
the
world
with
the
account
given
in
the
books
of
moses
the
timaeus
of
plato
with
the
book
of
genesis
the
heptaplus
is
dedicated
to
lorenzo
the
magnificent
whose
interest
the
preface
tells
us
in
the
secret
wisdom
of
moses
is
well
known
if
moses
seems
in
his
writings
simple
and
even
popular
rather
than
either
a
philosopher
or
a
theologian
that
is
because
it
was
an
institution
with
the
ancient
philosophers
either
not
to
speak
of
divine
things
at
all
or
to
speak
of
them
dissemblingly
hence
their
doctrines
were
called
mysteries
taught
by
them
pythagoras
became
so
great
a
master
of
silence
and
wrote
almost
nothing
thus
hiding
the
words
of
god
in
his
heart
and
speaking
wisdom
only
among
the
perfect
in
explaining
the
harmony
between
plato
and
moses
pico
lays
hold
on
every
sort
of
figure
and
analogy
on
the
double
meanings
of
words
the
symbols
of
the
jewish
ritual
the
secondary
meanings
of
obscure
stories
in
the
later
greek
mythologists
everywhere
there
is
an
unbroken
system
of
correspondences
every
object
in
the
terrestrial
world
is
an
analogue
a
symbol
or
counterpart
of
some
higher
reality
in
the
starry
heavens
and
this
again
of
some
law
of
the
angelic
life
in
the
world
beyond
the
stars
there
is
the
element
of
fire
in
the
material
world
the
sun
is
the
fire
of
heaven
and
in
the
world
there
is
the
fire
of
the
seraphic
intelligence
but
behold
how
they
differ
the
elementary
fire
burns
the
heavenly
fire
vivifies
the
celestial
fire
loves
in
this
way
every
natural
object
every
combination
of
natural
forces
every
accident
in
the
lives
of
men
is
filled
with
higher
meanings
omens
prophecies
supernatural
coincidences
accompany
pico
himself
all
through
life
there
are
oracles
in
every
tree
and
and
a
significance
in
every
accidental
combination
of
the
events
of
life
this
constant
tendency
to
symbolism
and
imagery
gives
work
a
figured
style
by
which
it
has
some
real
resemblance
to
plato
and
he
differs
from
other
mystical
writers
of
his
time
by
a
genuine
desire
to
know
his
authorities
at
first
hand
he
reads
plato
in
greek
moses
in
hebrew
and
by
this
his
work
really
belongs
to
the
higher
culture
above
all
we
have
a
constant
sense
in
reading
him
that
his
thoughts
however
little
their
positive
value
may
be
are
connected
with
springs
beneath
them
of
deep
and
passionate
emotion
and
when
he
explains
the
grades
or
steps
by
which
the
soul
passes
from
the
love
of
a
physical
object
to
the
love
of
unseen
beauty
and
unfolds
the
analogies
between
this
process
and
other
movements
upward
of
human
thought
there
is
a
glow
and
vehemence
in
his
words
which
remind
one
of
the
manner
in
which
his
own
brief
existence
flamed
itself
away
i
said
that
the
renaissance
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
in
many
things
great
rather
by
what
it
designed
or
aspired
to
do
than
by
what
it
actually
achieved
it
remained
for
a
later
age
to
conceive
the
true
method
of
effecting
a
scientific
reconciliation
of
christian
sentiment
with
the
imagery
the
legends
the
theories
about
the
world
of
pagan
poetry
and
philosophy
for
that
age
the
only
possible
reconciliation
was
an
imaginative
one
and
resulted
from
the
efforts
of
artists
trained
in
christian
schools
to
handle
pagan
subjects
and
of
this
artistic
reconciliation
work
like
pico
was
but
the
feebler
counterpart
whatever
philosophers
had
to
say
on
one
side
or
the
other
whether
they
were
successful
or
not
in
their
attempts
to
reconcile
the
old
to
the
new
and
to
justify
the
expenditure
of
so
much
care
and
thought
on
the
dreams
of
a
dead
faith
the
imagery
of
the
greek
religion
the
direct
charm
of
its
story
were
by
artists
valued
and
cultivated
for
their
own
sake
hence
a
new
sort
of
mythology
with
a
tone
and
qualities
of
its
own
when
the
of
sacred
earth
from
the
soil
of
jerusalem
was
mingled
with
the
common
clay
in
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
a
new
flower
grew
up
from
it
unlike
any
flower
men
had
seen
before
the
anemone
with
its
concentric
rings
of
strangely
blended
colour
still
to
be
found
by
those
who
search
long
enough
for
it
in
the
long
grass
of
the
maremma
just
such
a
strange
flower
was
that
mythology
of
the
italian
renaissance
which
grew
up
from
the
mixture
of
two
traditions
two
sentiments
the
sacred
and
the
profane
classical
story
was
regarded
as
so
much
imaginative
material
to
be
received
and
assimilated
it
did
not
come
into
men
minds
to
ask
curiously
of
science
concerning
the
origin
of
such
story
its
primary
form
and
import
its
meaning
for
those
who
projected
it
the
thing
sank
into
their
minds
to
issue
forth
again
with
all
the
tangle
about
it
of
medieval
sentiment
and
ideas
in
the
doni
madonna
in
the
tribune
of
the
uffizii
michelangelo
actually
brings
the
pagan
religion
and
with
it
the
unveiled
human
form
the
fauns
of
a
dionysiac
revel
into
the
presence
of
the
madonna
as
simpler
painters
had
introduced
there
other
products
of
the
earth
birds
or
flowers
while
he
has
given
to
that
madonna
herself
much
of
the
uncouth
energy
of
the
older
and
more
primitive
mighty
mother
this
picturesque
union
of
contrasts
belonging
properly
to
the
art
of
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
pervades
in
pico
della
mirandola
an
actual
person
and
that
is
why
the
figure
of
pico
is
so
attractive
he
will
not
let
one
go
he
wins
one
on
in
spite
of
one
self
to
turn
again
to
the
pages
of
his
forgotten
books
although
we
know
already
that
the
actual
solution
proposed
in
them
will
satisfy
us
as
little
as
perhaps
it
satisfied
him
it
is
said
that
in
his
eagerness
for
mysterious
learning
he
once
paid
a
great
sum
for
a
collection
of
cabalistic
manuscripts
which
turned
out
to
be
forgeries
and
the
story
might
well
stand
as
a
parable
of
all
he
ever
seemed
to
gain
in
the
way
of
actual
knowledge
he
had
sought
knowledge
and
passed
from
system
to
system
and
hazarded
much
but
less
for
the
sake
of
positive
knowledge
than
because
he
believed
there
was
a
spirit
of
order
and
beauty
in
knowledge
which
would
come
down
and
unite
what
ignorance
had
divided
and
renew
what
time
had
made
dim
and
so
while
his
actual
work
has
passed
away
yet
his
own
qualities
are
still
active
and
himself
remains
as
one
alive
in
the
grave
caesiis
et
vigilibus
oculis
as
his
biographer
describes
him
and
with
that
sanguine
clear
skin
decenti
rubore
interspersa
as
with
the
light
of
morning
upon
it
and
he
has
a
true
place
in
that
group
of
great
italians
who
fill
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
with
their
names
he
is
a
true
humanist
for
the
essence
of
humanism
is
that
belief
of
which
he
seems
never
to
have
doubted
that
nothing
which
has
ever
interested
living
men
and
women
can
wholly
lose
its
vitality
no
language
they
have
spoken
nor
oracle
beside
which
they
have
hushed
their
voices
no
dream
which
has
once
been
entertained
by
actual
human
minds
nothing
about
which
they
have
ever
been
passionate
or
expended
time
and
zeal
sandro
botticelli
in
leonardo
treatise
on
painting
only
one
contemporary
is
mentioned
by
name
sandro
botticelli
this
may
be
due
to
chance
only
but
to
some
will
rather
appear
a
result
of
deliberate
judgment
for
people
have
begun
to
find
out
the
charm
of
botticelli
work
and
his
name
little
known
in
the
last
century
is
quietly
becoming
important
in
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
he
had
already
anticipated
much
of
that
meditative
subtlety
which
is
sometimes
supposed
peculiar
to
the
great
imaginative
workmen
of
its
close
leaving
the
simple
religion
which
had
occupied
the
followers
of
giotto
for
a
century
and
the
simple
naturalism
which
had
grown
out
of
it
a
thing
of
birds
and
flowers
only
he
sought
inspiration
in
what
to
him
were
works
of
the
modern
world
the
writings
of
dante
and
boccaccio
and
in
new
readings
of
his
own
of
classical
stories
or
if
he
painted
religious
incidents
painted
them
with
an
of
original
sentiment
which
touches
you
as
the
real
matter
of
the
picture
through
the
veil
of
its
ostensible
subject
what
is
the
peculiar
sensation
what
is
the
peculiar
quality
of
pleasure
which
his
work
has
the
property
of
exciting
in
us
and
which
we
can
not
get
elsewhere
for
this
especially
when
he
has
to
speak
of
a
comparatively
unknown
artist
is
always
the
chief
question
which
a
critic
has
to
answer
in
an
age
when
the
lives
of
artists
were
full
of
adventure
his
life
is
almost
colourless
criticism
indeed
has
cleared
away
much
of
the
gossip
which
vasari
accumulated
has
touched
the
legend
of
lippo
and
lucrezia
and
rehabilitated
the
character
of
andrea
del
castagno
but
in
botticelli
case
there
is
no
legend
to
dissipate
he
did
not
even
go
by
his
true
name
sandro
is
a
nickname
and
his
true
name
is
filipepi
botticelli
being
only
the
name
of
the
goldsmith
who
first
taught
him
art
only
two
things
happened
to
him
two
things
which
he
shared
with
other
artists
he
was
invited
to
rome
to
paint
in
the
sistine
chapel
and
he
fell
in
later
life
under
the
influence
of
savonarola
passing
apparently
almost
out
of
men
sight
in
a
sort
of
religious
melancholy
which
lasted
till
his
death
in
according
to
the
received
date
vasari
says
that
he
plunged
into
the
study
of
dante
and
even
wrote
a
comment
on
the
divine
comedy
but
it
seems
strange
that
he
should
have
lived
on
inactive
so
long
and
one
almost
wishes
that
some
document
might
come
to
light
which
fixing
the
date
of
his
death
earlier
might
relieve
one
in
thinking
of
him
of
his
dejected
old
age
he
is
before
all
things
a
poetical
painter
blending
the
charm
of
story
and
sentiment
the
medium
of
the
art
of
poetry
with
the
charm
of
line
and
colour
the
medium
of
abstract
painting
so
he
becomes
the
illustrator
of
dante
in
a
few
rare
examples
of
the
edition
of
the
blank
spaces
left
at
the
beginning
of
every
canto
for
the
hand
of
the
illuminator
have
been
filled
as
far
as
the
nineteenth
canto
of
the
inferno
with
impressions
of
engraved
plates
seemingly
by
way
of
experiment
for
in
the
copy
in
the
bodleian
library
one
of
the
three
impressions
it
contains
has
been
printed
upside
down
and
much
awry
in
the
midst
of
the
luxurious
printed
page
giotto
and
the
followers
of
giotto
with
their
almost
childish
religious
aim
had
not
learned
to
put
that
weight
of
meaning
into
outward
things
light
colour
everyday
gesture
which
the
poetry
of
the
divine
comedy
involves
and
before
the
fifteenth
century
dante
could
hardly
have
found
an
illustrator
botticelli
illustrations
are
crowded
with
incident
blending
with
a
naďve
carelessness
of
pictorial
propriety
three
phases
of
the
same
scene
into
one
plate
the
grotesques
so
often
a
to
painters
who
forget
that
the
words
of
a
poet
which
only
feebly
present
an
image
to
the
mind
must
be
lowered
in
key
when
translated
into
visible
form
make
one
regret
that
he
has
not
rather
chosen
for
illustration
the
more
subdued
imagery
of
the
purgatorio
yet
in
the
scene
of
those
who
go
down
quick
into
hell
there
is
an
inventive
force
about
the
fire
taking
hold
on
the
upturned
soles
of
the
feet
which
proves
that
the
design
is
no
mere
translation
of
dante
words
but
a
true
painter
vision
while
the
scene
of
the
centaurs
wins
one
at
once
for
forgetful
of
the
actual
circumstances
of
their
appearance
botticelli
has
gone
off
with
delight
on
the
thought
of
the
centaurs
themselves
bright
small
creatures
of
the
woodland
with
arch
baby
faces
and
mignon
forms
drawing
tiny
bows
botticelli
lived
in
a
generation
of
naturalists
and
he
might
have
been
a
mere
naturalist
among
them
there
are
traces
enough
in
his
work
of
that
alert
sense
of
outward
things
which
in
the
pictures
of
that
period
fills
the
lawns
with
delicate
living
creatures
and
the
hillsides
with
pools
of
water
and
the
pools
of
water
with
flowering
reeds
but
this
was
not
enough
for
him
he
is
a
visionary
painter
and
in
his
visionariness
he
resembles
dante
giotto
the
tried
companion
of
dante
masaccio
ghirlandajo
even
do
but
transcribe
with
more
or
less
refining
the
outward
image
they
are
dramatic
not
visionary
painters
they
are
almost
impassive
spectators
of
the
action
before
them
but
the
genius
of
which
botticelli
is
the
type
usurps
the
data
before
it
as
the
exponent
of
ideas
moods
visions
of
its
own
in
this
interest
it
plays
fast
and
loose
with
those
data
rejecting
some
and
isolating
others
and
always
combining
them
anew
to
him
as
to
dante
the
scene
the
colour
the
outward
image
or
gesture
comes
with
all
its
incisive
and
importunate
reality
but
awakes
in
him
moreover
by
some
subtle
law
of
his
own
structure
a
mood
which
it
awakes
in
no
one
else
of
which
it
is
the
double
or
repetition
and
which
it
clothes
that
all
may
share
it
with
visible
circumstance
but
he
is
far
enough
from
accepting
the
conventional
orthodoxy
of
dante
which
referring
all
human
action
to
the
simple
formula
of
purgatory
heaven
and
hell
leaves
an
insoluble
element
of
prose
in
the
depths
of
dante
poetry
one
picture
of
his
with
the
portrait
of
the
donor
matteo
palmieri
below
had
the
credit
or
discredit
of
attracting
some
shadow
of
ecclesiastical
censure
this
matteo
palmieri
two
dim
figures
move
under
that
name
in
contemporary
history
was
the
reputed
author
of
a
poem
still
unedited
la
cittŕ
divina
which
represented
the
human
race
as
an
incarnation
of
those
angels
who
in
the
revolt
of
lucifer
were
neither
for
jehovah
nor
for
his
enemies
a
fantasy
of
that
earlier
alexandrian
philosophy
about
which
the
florentine
intellect
in
that
century
was
so
curious
botticelli
picture
may
have
been
only
one
of
those
familiar
compositions
in
which
religious
reverie
has
recorded
its
impressions
of
the
various
forms
of
beatified
existence
glorias
as
they
were
called
like
that
in
which
giotto
painted
the
portrait
of
dante
but
somehow
it
was
suspected
of
embodying
in
a
picture
the
wayward
dream
of
palmieri
and
the
chapel
where
it
hung
was
closed
artists
so
entire
as
botticelli
are
usually
careless
about
philosophical
theories
even
when
the
philosopher
is
a
florentine
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
his
work
a
poem
in
terza
rima
but
botticelli
who
wrote
a
commentary
on
dante
and
became
the
disciple
of
savonarola
may
well
have
let
such
theories
come
and
go
across
him
true
or
false
the
story
interprets
much
of
the
peculiar
sentiment
with
which
he
infuses
his
profane
and
sacred
persons
comely
and
in
a
certain
sense
like
angels
but
with
a
sense
of
displacement
or
loss
about
them
the
wistfulness
of
exiles
conscious
of
a
passion
and
energy
greater
than
any
known
issue
of
them
explains
which
runs
through
all
his
varied
work
with
a
sentiment
of
ineffable
melancholy
so
just
what
dante
scorns
as
unworthy
alike
of
heaven
and
hell
botticelli
accepts
that
middle
world
in
which
men
take
no
side
in
great
conflicts
and
decide
no
great
causes
and
make
great
refusals
he
thus
sets
for
himself
the
limits
within
which
art
undisturbed
by
any
moral
ambition
does
its
most
sincere
and
surest
work
his
interest
is
neither
in
the
untempered
goodness
of
angelico
saints
nor
the
untempered
evil
of
inferno
but
with
men
and
women
in
their
mixed
and
uncertain
condition
always
attractive
clothed
sometimes
by
passion
with
a
character
of
loveliness
and
energy
but
saddened
perpetually
by
the
shadow
upon
them
of
the
great
things
from
which
they
shrink
his
morality
is
all
sympathy
and
it
is
this
sympathy
conveying
into
his
work
somewhat
more
than
is
usual
of
the
true
complexion
of
humanity
which
makes
him
visionary
as
he
is
so
forcible
a
realist
it
is
this
which
gives
to
his
madonnas
their
unique
expression
and
charm
he
has
worked
out
in
them
a
distinct
and
peculiar
type
definite
enough
in
his
own
mind
for
he
has
painted
it
over
and
over
again
sometimes
one
might
think
almost
mechanically
as
a
pastime
during
that
dark
period
when
his
thoughts
were
so
heavy
upon
him
hardly
any
collection
of
note
is
without
one
of
these
circular
pictures
into
which
the
attendant
angels
depress
their
heads
so
naďvely
perhaps
you
have
sometimes
wondered
why
those
madonnas
conformed
to
no
acknowledged
or
obvious
type
of
beauty
attract
you
more
and
more
and
often
come
back
to
you
when
the
sistine
madonna
and
the
virgins
of
fra
angelico
are
forgotten
at
first
contrasting
them
with
those
you
may
have
thought
that
there
was
something
in
them
mean
or
abject
even
for
the
abstract
lines
of
the
face
have
little
nobleness
and
the
colour
is
wan
for
with
botticelli
she
too
though
she
holds
in
her
hands
the
desire
of
all
nations
is
one
of
those
who
are
neither
for
jehovah
nor
for
his
enemies
and
her
choice
is
on
her
face
the
white
light
on
it
is
cast
up
hard
and
cheerless
from
below
as
when
snow
lies
upon
the
ground
and
the
children
look
up
with
surprise
at
the
strange
whiteness
of
the
ceiling
her
trouble
is
in
the
very
caress
of
the
mysterious
child
whose
gaze
is
always
far
from
her
and
who
has
already
that
sweet
look
of
devotion
which
men
have
never
been
able
altogether
to
love
and
which
still
makes
the
born
saint
an
object
almost
of
suspicion
to
his
earthly
brethren
once
indeed
he
guides
her
hand
to
transcribe
in
a
book
the
words
of
her
exaltation
the
ave
and
the
magnificat
and
the
gaude
maria
and
the
young
angels
glad
to
rouse
her
for
a
moment
from
her
dejection
are
eager
to
hold
the
inkhorn
and
to
support
the
book
but
the
pen
almost
drops
from
her
hand
and
the
high
cold
words
have
no
meaning
for
her
and
her
true
children
are
those
others
among
whom
in
her
rude
home
the
intolerable
honour
came
to
her
with
that
look
of
wistful
inquiry
on
their
irregular
faces
which
you
see
in
startled
animals
gipsy
children
such
as
those
who
in
apennine
villages
still
hold
out
their
long
brown
arms
to
beg
of
you
but
on
sundays
become
enfants
du
choeur
with
their
thick
black
hair
nicely
combed
and
fair
white
linen
on
their
sunburnt
throats
what
is
strangest
is
that
he
carries
this
sentiment
into
classical
subjects
its
most
complete
expression
being
a
picture
in
the
uffizii
of
venus
rising
from
the
sea
in
which
the
grotesque
emblems
of
the
middle
age
and
a
landscape
full
of
its
peculiar
feeling
and
even
its
strange
draperies
powdered
all
over
in
the
gothic
manner
with
a
quaint
conceit
of
daisies
frame
a
figure
that
reminds
you
of
the
faultless
nude
studies
of
ingres
at
first
perhaps
you
are
attracted
only
by
a
quaintness
of
design
which
seems
to
recall
all
at
once
whatever
you
have
read
of
florence
in
the
fifteenth
century
afterwards
you
may
think
that
this
quaintness
must
be
incongruous
with
the
subject
and
that
the
colour
is
cadaverous
or
at
least
cold
and
yet
the
more
you
come
to
understand
what
imaginative
colouring
really
is
that
all
colour
is
no
mere
delightful
quality
of
natural
things
but
a
spirit
upon
them
by
which
they
become
expressive
to
the
spirit
the
better
you
will
like
this
peculiar
quality
of
colour
and
you
will
find
that
quaint
design
of
botticelli
a
more
direct
inlet
into
the
greek
temper
than
the
works
of
the
greeks
themselves
even
of
the
finest
period
of
the
greeks
as
they
really
were
of
their
difference
from
ourselves
of
the
aspects
of
their
outward
life
we
know
far
more
than
botticelli
or
his
most
learned
contemporaries
but
for
us
long
familiarity
has
taken
off
the
edge
of
the
lesson
and
we
are
hardly
conscious
of
what
we
owe
to
the
hellenic
spirit
but
in
pictures
like
this
of
botticelli
you
have
a
record
of
the
first
impression
made
by
it
on
minds
turned
back
towards
it
in
almost
painful
aspiration
from
a
world
in
which
it
had
been
ignored
so
long
and
in
the
passion
the
energy
the
industry
of
realisation
with
which
botticelli
carries
out
his
intention
is
the
exact
measure
of
the
legitimate
influence
over
the
human
mind
of
the
imaginative
system
of
which
this
is
perhaps
the
central
myth
the
light
is
indeed
cold
mere
sunless
dawn
but
a
later
painter
would
have
cloyed
you
with
sunshine
and
you
can
see
the
better
for
that
quietness
in
the
morning
air
each
long
promontory
as
it
slopes
down
to
the
water
edge
men
go
forth
to
their
labours
until
the
evening
but
she
is
awake
before
them
and
you
might
think
that
the
sorrow
in
her
face
was
at
the
thought
of
the
whole
long
day
of
love
yet
to
come
an
emblematical
figure
of
the
wind
blows
hard
across
the
grey
water
moving
forward
the
shell
on
which
she
sails
the
sea
showing
his
teeth
as
it
moves
in
thin
lines
of
foam
and
sucking
in
one
by
one
the
falling
roses
each
severe
in
outline
plucked
off
short
at
the
stalk
but
embrowned
a
little
as
botticelli
flowers
always
are
botticelli
meant
all
this
imagery
to
be
altogether
pleasurable
and
it
was
partly
an
incompleteness
of
resources
inseparable
from
the
art
of
that
time
that
subdued
and
chilled
it
but
this
predilection
for
minor
tones
counts
also
and
what
is
unmistakable
is
the
sadness
with
which
he
has
conceived
the
goddess
of
pleasure
as
the
depositary
of
a
great
power
over
the
lives
of
men
i
have
said
that
the
peculiar
character
of
botticelli
is
the
result
of
a
blending
in
him
of
a
sympathy
for
humanity
in
its
uncertain
condition
its
attractiveness
its
investiture
at
rarer
moments
in
a
character
of
loveliness
and
energy
with
his
consciousness
of
the
shadow
upon
it
of
the
great
things
from
which
it
shrinks
and
that
this
conveys
into
his
work
somewhat
more
than
painting
usually
attains
of
the
true
complexion
of
humanity
he
paints
the
story
of
the
goddess
of
pleasure
in
other
episodes
besides
that
of
her
birth
from
the
sea
but
never
without
some
shadow
of
death
in
the
grey
flesh
and
wan
flowers
he
paints
madonnas
but
they
shrink
from
the
pressure
of
the
divine
child
and
plead
in
unmistakable
undertones
for
a
warmer
lower
humanity
the
same
figure
tradition
connects
it
with
simonetta
the
mistress
of
giuliano
medici
appears
again
as
judith
returning
home
across
the
hill
country
when
the
great
deed
is
over
and
the
moment
of
revulsion
come
when
the
olive
branch
in
her
hand
is
becoming
a
burthen
as
justice
sitting
on
a
throne
but
with
a
fixed
look
of
which
makes
the
sword
in
her
hand
seem
that
of
a
suicide
and
again
as
veritas
in
the
allegorical
picture
of
calumnia
where
one
may
note
in
passing
the
suggestiveness
of
an
accident
which
identifies
the
image
of
truth
with
the
person
of
venus
we
might
trace
the
same
sentiment
through
his
engravings
but
his
share
in
them
is
doubtful
and
the
object
of
this
brief
study
has
been
attained
if
i
have
defined
aright
the
temper
in
which
he
worked
but
after
all
it
may
be
asked
is
a
painter
like
botticelli
a
secondary
painter
a
proper
subject
for
general
criticism
there
are
a
few
great
painters
like
michelangelo
or
leonardo
whose
work
has
become
a
force
in
general
culture
partly
for
this
very
reason
that
they
have
absorbed
into
themselves
all
such
workmen
as
sandro
botticelli
and
over
and
above
mere
technical
or
antiquarian
criticism
general
criticism
may
be
very
well
employed
in
that
sort
of
interpretation
which
adjusts
the
position
of
these
men
to
general
culture
whereas
smaller
men
can
be
the
proper
subjects
only
of
technical
or
antiquarian
treatment
but
besides
those
great
men
there
is
a
certain
number
of
artists
who
have
a
distinct
faculty
of
their
own
by
which
they
convey
to
us
a
peculiar
quality
of
pleasure
which
we
can
not
get
elsewhere
and
these
too
have
their
place
in
general
culture
and
must
be
interpreted
to
it
by
those
who
have
felt
their
charm
strongly
and
are
often
the
object
of
a
special
diligence
and
a
consideration
wholly
affectionate
just
because
there
is
not
about
them
the
stress
of
a
great
name
and
authority
of
this
select
number
botticelli
is
one
he
has
the
freshness
the
uncertain
and
diffident
promise
which
belong
to
the
earlier
renaissance
itself
and
make
it
perhaps
the
most
interesting
period
in
the
history
of
the
mind
in
studying
his
work
one
begins
to
understand
to
how
great
a
place
in
human
culture
the
art
of
italy
had
been
called
notes
none
luca
della
robbia
the
italian
sculptors
of
the
earlier
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
are
more
than
mere
forerunners
of
the
great
masters
of
its
close
and
often
reach
perfection
within
the
narrow
limits
which
they
chose
to
impose
on
their
work
their
sculpture
shares
with
the
paintings
of
botticelli
and
the
churches
of
brunelleschi
that
profound
expressiveness
that
intimate
impress
of
an
indwelling
soul
which
is
the
peculiar
fascination
of
the
art
of
italy
in
that
century
their
works
have
been
much
neglected
and
often
almost
hidden
away
amid
the
frippery
of
modern
decoration
and
we
come
with
some
surprise
on
the
places
where
their
fire
still
smoulders
one
longs
to
penetrate
into
the
lives
of
the
men
who
have
given
expression
to
so
much
power
and
sweetness
but
it
is
part
of
the
reserve
the
austere
dignity
and
simplicity
of
their
existence
that
their
histories
are
for
the
most
part
lost
or
told
but
briefly
from
their
lives
as
from
their
work
all
tumult
of
sound
and
colour
has
passed
away
mino
the
raphael
of
sculpture
maso
del
rodario
whose
works
add
a
further
grace
to
the
church
of
como
donatello
even
one
asks
in
vain
for
more
than
a
shadowy
outline
of
their
actual
days
something
more
remains
of
luca
della
robbia
something
more
of
a
history
of
outward
changes
and
fortunes
is
expressed
through
his
work
i
suppose
nothing
brings
the
real
air
of
a
tuscan
town
so
vividly
to
mind
as
those
pieces
of
pale
blue
and
white
earthenware
by
which
he
is
best
known
like
fragments
of
the
milky
sky
itself
fallen
into
the
cool
streets
and
breaking
into
the
darkened
churches
and
no
work
is
less
imitable
like
tuscan
wine
it
loses
its
savour
when
moved
from
its
birthplace
from
the
crumbling
walls
where
it
was
first
placed
part
of
the
charm
of
this
work
its
grace
and
purity
and
finish
of
expression
is
common
to
all
the
tuscan
sculptors
of
the
fifteenth
century
for
luca
was
first
of
all
a
worker
in
marble
and
his
works
in
terra
cotta
only
transfer
to
a
different
material
the
principles
of
his
sculpture
these
tuscan
sculptors
of
the
fifteenth
century
worked
for
the
most
part
in
low
relief
giving
even
to
their
monumental
effigies
something
of
its
depression
of
surface
getting
into
them
by
this
means
a
pathetic
suggestion
of
the
wasting
and
etherealisation
of
death
they
are
haters
of
all
heaviness
and
emphasis
of
light
and
shade
and
seek
their
means
of
delineation
among
those
last
refinements
of
shadow
which
are
almost
invisible
except
in
a
strong
light
and
which
the
finest
pencil
can
hardly
follow
the
whole
essence
of
their
work
is
expression
the
passing
of
a
smile
over
the
face
of
a
child
the
ripple
of
the
air
on
a
still
day
over
the
curtain
of
a
window
ajar
what
is
the
precise
value
of
this
system
of
sculpture
this
low
relief
luca
della
robbia
and
the
other
sculptors
of
the
school
to
which
he
belongs
have
before
them
the
universal
problem
of
their
art
and
this
system
of
low
relief
is
the
means
by
which
they
meet
and
overcome
the
special
limitation
of
sculpture
that
limitation
results
from
the
material
and
other
necessary
conditions
of
all
sculptured
work
and
consists
in
the
tendency
of
such
work
to
a
hard
realism
a
presentment
of
mere
form
that
solid
material
frame
which
only
motion
can
relieve
a
thing
of
heavy
shadows
and
an
individuality
of
expression
pushed
to
caricature
against
this
tendency
to
the
hard
presentment
of
mere
form
trying
vainly
to
compete
with
the
reality
of
nature
itself
all
noble
sculpture
constantly
struggles
each
great
system
of
sculpture
resisting
it
in
its
own
way
etherealising
spiritualising
relieving
its
stiffness
its
heaviness
and
death
the
use
of
colour
in
sculpture
is
but
an
unskilful
contrivance
to
effect
by
borrowing
from
another
art
what
the
nobler
sculpture
effects
by
strictly
appropriate
means
to
get
not
colour
but
the
equivalent
of
colour
to
secure
the
expression
and
the
play
of
life
to
expand
the
too
firmly
fixed
individuality
of
pure
unrelieved
uncoloured
form
this
is
the
problem
which
the
three
great
styles
in
sculpture
have
solved
in
three
different
ways
allgemeinheit
breadth
generality
universality
is
the
word
chosen
by
winckelmann
and
after
him
by
goethe
and
many
german
critics
to
express
that
law
of
the
most
excellent
greek
sculptors
of
pheidias
and
his
pupils
which
prompted
them
constantly
to
seek
the
type
in
the
individual
to
abstract
and
express
only
what
is
structural
and
permanent
to
purge
from
the
individual
all
that
belongs
only
to
him
all
the
accidents
the
feelings
and
actions
of
the
special
moment
all
that
because
in
its
own
nature
it
endures
but
for
a
moment
is
apt
to
look
like
a
frozen
thing
if
one
arrests
it
in
this
way
their
works
came
to
be
like
some
subtle
extract
or
essence
or
almost
like
pure
thoughts
or
ideas
and
hence
the
breadth
of
humanity
in
them
that
detachment
from
the
conditions
of
a
particular
place
or
people
which
has
carried
their
influence
far
beyond
the
age
which
produced
them
and
insured
them
universal
acceptance
that
was
the
greek
way
of
relieving
the
hardness
and
unspirituality
of
pure
form
but
it
involved
to
a
certain
degree
the
sacrifice
of
what
we
call
expression
and
a
system
of
abstraction
which
aimed
always
at
the
broad
and
general
type
at
the
purging
away
from
the
individual
of
what
belonged
only
to
him
and
of
the
mere
accidents
of
a
particular
time
and
place
imposed
upon
the
range
of
effects
open
to
the
greek
sculptor
limits
somewhat
narrowly
defined
when
michelangelo
came
therefore
with
a
genius
spiritualised
by
the
reverie
of
the
middle
age
penetrated
by
its
spirit
of
inwardness
and
introspection
living
not
a
mere
outward
life
like
the
greek
but
a
life
full
of
intimate
experiences
sorrows
consolations
a
system
which
sacrificed
so
much
of
what
was
inward
and
unseen
could
not
satisfy
him
to
him
lover
and
student
of
greek
sculpture
as
he
was
work
which
did
not
bring
what
was
inward
to
the
surface
which
was
not
concerned
with
individual
expression
with
individual
character
and
feeling
the
special
history
of
the
special
soul
was
not
worth
doing
at
all
and
so
in
a
way
quite
personal
and
peculiar
to
himself
which
often
is
and
always
seems
the
effect
of
accident
he
secured
for
his
work
individuality
and
intensity
of
expression
while
he
avoided
a
too
heavy
realism
that
tendency
to
harden
into
caricature
which
the
representation
of
feeling
in
sculpture
is
apt
to
display
what
time
and
accident
its
centuries
of
darkness
under
the
furrows
of
the
little
melian
farm
have
done
with
singular
felicity
of
touch
for
the
venus
of
melos
fraying
its
surface
and
softening
its
lines
so
that
some
spirit
in
the
thing
seems
always
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
as
though
in
it
classical
sculpture
had
advanced
already
one
step
into
the
mystical
christian
age
its
expression
being
in
the
whole
range
of
ancient
work
most
like
that
of
michelangelo
own
this
effect
michelangelo
gains
by
leaving
nearly
all
his
sculpture
in
a
puzzling
sort
of
incompleteness
which
suggests
rather
than
realises
actual
form
something
of
the
wasting
of
that
image
which
he
moulded
at
the
command
of
piero
de
medici
when
the
snow
lay
one
night
in
the
court
of
the
pitti
palace
almost
always
lurks
about
it
as
if
he
had
determined
to
make
the
quality
of
a
task
exacted
from
him
half
in
derision
the
pride
of
all
his
work
many
have
wondered
at
that
incompleteness
suspecting
however
that
michelangelo
himself
loved
and
was
loath
to
change
it
and
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
they
too
would
lose
something
if
the
form
ever
quite
emerged
from
the
stone
so
here
so
delicately
finished
there
and
they
have
wished
to
fathom
the
charm
of
this
incompleteness
well
that
incompleteness
is
equivalent
for
colour
in
sculpture
it
is
his
way
of
etherealising
pure
form
of
relieving
its
stiff
realism
and
communicating
to
it
breath
pulsation
the
effect
of
life
it
was
a
characteristic
too
which
fell
in
with
his
peculiar
temper
and
mode
of
living
his
disappointments
and
hesitations
and
it
was
in
reality
perfect
finish
in
this
way
he
combines
the
utmost
amount
of
passion
and
intensity
with
the
sense
of
a
yielding
and
flexible
life
he
gets
not
vitality
merely
but
a
wonderful
force
of
expression
midway
between
these
two
systems
the
system
of
the
greek
sculptors
and
the
system
of
michelangelo
comes
the
system
of
luca
della
robbia
and
the
other
tuscan
sculptors
of
the
fifteenth
century
partaking
both
of
the
allgemeinheit
of
the
greeks
their
way
of
extracting
certain
select
elements
only
of
pure
form
and
sacrificing
all
the
rest
and
the
studied
incompleteness
of
michelangelo
relieving
that
sense
of
intensity
passion
energy
which
might
otherwise
have
stiffened
into
caricature
like
michelangelo
these
sculptors
fill
their
works
with
intense
and
individualised
expression
their
noblest
works
are
the
careful
sepulchral
portraits
of
particular
persons
the
monument
of
conte
ugo
in
the
badía
of
florence
of
the
youthful
medea
colleoni
with
the
wonderful
long
throat
in
the
chapel
on
the
cool
north
side
of
the
church
of
santa
maria
maggiore
at
bergamo
monuments
such
as
abound
in
the
churches
of
rome
inexhaustible
in
suggestions
of
repose
of
a
subdued
sabbatic
joy
a
kind
of
sacred
grace
and
refinement
and
these
elements
of
tranquillity
of
repose
they
unite
to
an
intense
and
individual
expression
by
a
system
of
conventionalism
as
skilful
and
subtle
as
that
of
the
greeks
repressing
all
such
curves
as
indicate
solid
form
and
throwing
the
whole
into
low
relief
the
life
of
luca
a
life
of
labour
and
frugality
with
no
adventure
and
no
excitement
except
what
belongs
to
the
trial
of
new
artistic
processes
the
struggle
with
new
artistic
difficulties
the
solution
of
purely
artistic
problems
fills
the
first
seventy
years
of
the
fifteenth
century
after
producing
many
works
in
marble
for
the
duomo
and
the
campanile
of
florence
which
place
him
among
the
foremost
masters
of
the
sculpture
of
his
age
he
became
desirous
to
realise
the
spirit
and
manner
of
that
sculpture
in
a
humbler
material
to
unite
its
science
its
exquisite
and
expressive
system
of
low
relief
to
the
homely
art
of
pottery
to
introduce
those
high
qualities
into
common
things
to
adorn
and
cultivate
daily
household
life
in
this
he
is
profoundly
characteristic
of
the
florence
of
that
century
of
that
in
it
which
lay
below
its
superficial
vanity
and
caprice
a
certain
modesty
and
seriousness
and
simplicity
people
had
not
yet
begun
to
think
that
what
was
good
art
for
churches
was
not
so
good
or
less
fitted
for
their
own
houses
luca
new
work
was
in
plain
white
earthenware
at
first
a
mere
rough
imitation
of
the
costly
laboriously
wrought
marble
finished
in
a
few
hours
but
on
this
humble
path
he
found
his
way
to
a
fresh
success
to
another
artistic
grace
the
fame
of
the
oriental

the

possessed
in
an
unusual
measure
that
special
characteristic

belongs

all
the

a
characteristic

even
in
the

seems
to
bring

near

bear
the
impress

a
personal
quality
a
expressiveness
what
the
french
call
intimité

which
is

is
rare
in

rarer
still
in

rarest
of

in

yet
essentially
perhaps
it
is
the
quality
which
alone
makes
work
in
the
imaginative
order
really
worth
having
at
all
it
is
because
the
works
of
the
artists
of

fifteenth
century
possess
this
quality
in
an
unmistakable
way
that
one
is
anxious
to
know

the
poetry
of
michelangelo
critics
of
michelangelo
have
sometimes
spoken
as
if
the
only
characteristic
of
his
genius
were
a
wonderful
strength
verging
as
in
the
things
of
the
imagination
great
strength
always
does
on
what
is
singular
or
strange
a
certain
strangeness
something
of
the
blossoming
of
the
aloe
is
indeed
an
element
in
all
true
works
of
art
that
they
shall
excite
or
surprise
us
is
indispensable
but
that
they
shall
give
pleasure
and
exert
a
charm
over
us
is
indispensable
too
and
this
strangeness
must
be
sweet
also
a
lovely
strangeness
and
to
the
true
admirers
of
michelangelo
this
is
the
true
type
of
the
michelangelesque
sweetness
and
strength
pleasure
with
surprise
an
energy
of
conception
which
seems
at
every
moment
about
to
break
through
all
the
conditions
of
comely
form
recovering
touch
by
touch
a
loveliness
found
usually
only
in
the
simplest
natural
things
ex
forti
dulcedo
in
this
way
he
sums
up
for
them
the
whole
character
of
medieval
art
itself
in
that
which
distinguishes
it
most
clearly
from
classical
work
the
presence
of
a
convulsive
energy
in
it
becoming
in
lower
hands
merely
monstrous
or
forbidding
and
felt
even
in
its
most
graceful
products
as
a
subdued
quaintness
or
grotesque
yet
those
who
feel
this
grace
or
sweetness
in
michelangelo
might
at
the
first
moment
be
puzzled
if
they
were
asked
wherein
precisely
such
quality
resided
men
of
inventive
temperament
victor
hugo
for
instance
in
whom
as
in
michelangelo
people
have
for
the
most
part
been
attracted
or
repelled
by
the
strength
while
few
have
understood
his
sweetness
have
sometimes
relieved
conceptions
of
merely
moral
or
spiritual
greatness
but
with
little
aesthetic
charm
of
their
own
by
lovely
accidents
or
accessories
like
the
butterfly
which
alights
on
the
barricade
in
les
misérables
or
those
for
whom
the
monstrous
gilliatt
comes
to
be
as
some
wild
natural
thing
so
that
they
are
no
longer
afraid
of
him
in
les
travailleurs
de
la
mer
but
the
austere
genius
of
michelangelo
will
not
depend
for
its
sweetness
on
any
mere
accessories
like
these
the
world
of
natural
things
has
almost
no
existence
for
him
when
one
speaks
of
him
says
grimm
woods
clouds
seas
and
mountains
disappear
and
only
what
is
formed
by
the
spirit
of
man
remains
behind
and
he
quotes
a
few
slight
words
from
a
letter
of
his
to
vasari
as
the
single
expression
in
all
he
has
left
of
a
feeling
for
nature
he
has
traced
no
flowers
like
those
with
which
leonardo
stars
over
his
gloomiest
rocks
nothing
like
the
of
wings
and
flames
in
which
blake
frames
his
most
startling
conceptions
no
like
titian
fills
his
backgrounds
but
only
blank
ranges
of
rock
and
dim
vegetable
forms
as
blank
as
they
as
in
a
world
before
the
creation
of
the
first
five
days
of
the
whole
story
of
the
creation
he
has
painted
only
the
creation
of
the
first
man
and
woman
and
for
him
at
least
feebly
the
creation
of
light
it
belongs
to
the
quality
of
his
genius
thus
to
concern
itself
almost
exclusively
with
the
making
of
man
for
him
it
is
not
as
in
the
story
itself
the
last
and
crowning
act
of
a
series
of
developments
but
the
first
and
unique
act
the
creation
of
life
itself
in
its
supreme
form
and
immediately
in
the
cold
and
lifeless
stone
with
him
the
beginning
of
life
has
all
the
characteristics
of
resurrection
it
is
like
the
recovery
of
suspended
health
or
animation
with
its
gratitude
its
effusion
and
eloquence
fair
as
the
young
men
of
the
elgin
marbles
the
adam
of
the
sistine
chapel
is
unlike
them
in
a
total
absence
of
that
balance
and
completeness
which
express
so
well
the
sentiment
of
a
independent
life
in
that
languid
figure
there
is
something
rude
and
something
akin
to
the
rugged
hillside
on
which
it
lies
his
whole
form
is
gathered
into
an
expression
of
mere
expectancy
and
reception
he
has
hardly
strength
enough
to
lift
his
finger
to
touch
the
finger
of
the
creator
yet
a
touch
of
the
will
suffice
this
creation
of
life
life
coming
always
as
relief
or
recovery
and
always
in
strong
contrast
with
the
mass
in
which
it
is
kindled
is
in
various
ways
the
motive
of
all
his
work
whether
its
immediate
subject
be
pagan
or
christian
legend
or
allegory
and
this
although
at
least
of
his
work
was
designed
for
the
adornment
of
tombs
the
tomb
of
julius
the
tombs
of
the
medici
not
the
judgment
but
the
resurrection
is
the
real
subject
of
his
last
work
in
the
sistine
chapel
and
his
favourite
pagan
subject
is
the
legend
of
leda
the
delight
of
the
world
breaking
from
the
egg
of
a
bird
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
he
secures
that
ideality
of
expression
which
in
greek
sculpture
depends
on
a
delicate
system
of
abstraction
and
in
early
italian
sculpture
on
lowness
of
relief
by
an
incompleteness
which
is
surely
not
always
undesigned
and
which
as
i
think
no
one
regrets
and
trusts
to
the
spectator
to
complete
the
emergent
form
and
as
his
persons
have
something
of
the
unwrought
stone
about
them
so
as
if
to
realise
the
expression
by
which
the
old
florentine
records
describe
a
sculptor
master
of
live
stone
with
him
the
very
rocks
seem
to
have
life
they
have
but
to
cast
away
the
dust
and
scurf
that
they
may
rise
and
stand
on
their
feet
he
loved
the
very
quarries
of
carrara
those
strange
grey
peaks
which
even
at
convey
into
any
scene
from
which
they
are
visible
something
of
the
solemnity
and
stillness
of
evening
sometimes
wandering
among
them
month
after
month
till
at
last
their
pale
ashen
colours
seem
to
have
passed
into
his
painting
and
on
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
david
there
still
remains
a
morsel
of
uncut
stone
as
if
by
one
touch
to
maintain
its
connexion
with
the
place
from
which
it
was
hewn
and
it
is
in
this
penetrative
suggestion
of
life
that
the
secret
of
that
sweetness
of
his
is
to
be
found
he
gives
us
indeed
no
lovely
natural
objects
like
leonardo
or
titian
but
only
the
coldest
most
elementary
shadowing
of
rock
or
tree
no
lovely
draperies
and
comely
gestures
of
life
but
only
the
austere
truths
of
human
nature
simple
persons
as
he
replied
in
his
rough
way
to
the
querulous
criticism
of
julius
the
second
that
there
was
no
gold
on
the
figures
of
the
sistine
chapel
simple
persons
who
wore
no
gold
on
their
garments
but
he
penetrates
us
with
a
feeling
of
that
power
which
we
associate
with
all
the
warmth
and
fulness
of
the
world
the
sense
of
which
brings
into
one
thoughts
a
swarm
of
birds
and
flowers
and
insects
the
brooding
spirit
of
life
itself
is
there
and
the
summer
may
burst
out
in
a
moment
he
was
born
in
an
interval
of
a
rapid
journey
in
march
at
a
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
arezzo
the
thin
clear
air
of
which
was
then
thought
to
be
favourable
to
the
birth
of
children
of
great
parts
he
came
of
a
race
of
grave
and
dignified
men
who
claiming
kinship
with
the
family
of
canossa
and
some
colour
of
imperial
blood
in
their
veins
had
generation
after
generation
received
honourable
employment
under
the
government
of
florence
his
mother
a
girl
of
nineteen
years
put
him
out
to
nurse
at
a
country
house
among
the
hills
of
settignano
where
every
other
inhabitant
is
a
worker
in
the
marble
quarries
and
the
child
early
became
familiar
with
that
strange
first
stage
in
the
sculptor
art
to
this
succeeded
the
influence
of
the
sweetest
and
most
placid
master
florence
had
yet
seen
domenico
ghirlandajo
at
fifteen
he
was
at
work
among
the
curiosities
of
the
garden
of
the
medici
copying
and
restoring
antiques
winning
the
condescending
notice
of
the
great
lorenzo
he
knew
too
how
to
excite
strong
hatreds
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
in
a
quarrel
with
a
he
received
a
blow
on
the
face
which
deprived
him
for
ever
of
the
comeliness
of
outward
form
it
was
through
an
accident
that
he
came
to
study
those
works
of
the
early
italian
sculptors
which
suggested
much
of
his
own
grandest
work
and
impressed
it
with
so
deep
a
sweetness
he
believed
in
dreams
and
omens
one
of
his
friends
dreamed
twice
that
lorenzo
then
lately
dead
appeared
to
him
in
grey
and
dusty
apparel
to
michelangelo
this
dream
seemed
to
portend
the
troubles
which
afterwards
really
came
and
with
the
suddenness
which
was
characteristic
of
all
his
movements
he
left
florence
having
occasion
to
pass
through
bologna
he
neglected
to
procure
the
little
seal
of
red
wax
which
the
stranger
entering
bologna
must
carry
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
he
had
no
money
to
pay
the
fine
and
would
have
been
thrown
into
prison
had
not
one
of
the
magistrates
interposed
he
remained
in
this
man
house
a
whole
year
rewarding
his
hospitality
by
readings
from
the
italian
poets
whom
he
loved
bologna
with
its
endless
colonnades
and
fantastic
leaning
towers
can
never
have
been
one
of
the
lovelier
cities
of
italy
but
about
the
portals
of
its
vast
unfinished
churches
and
its
dark
shrines
half
hidden
by
votive
flowers
and
candles
lie
some
of
the
sweetest
works
of
the
early
tuscan
sculptors
giovanni
da
pisa
and
jacopo
della
quercia
things
as
winsome
as
flowers
and
the
year
which
michelangelo
spent
in
copying
these
works
was
not
a
lost
year
it
was
now
on
returning
to
florence
that
he
put
forth
that
unique
presentment
of
bacchus
which
expresses
not
the
mirthfulness
of
the
god
of
wine
but
his
sleepy
seriousness
his
enthusiasm
his
capacity
for
profound
dreaming
no
one
ever
expressed
more
truly
than
michelangelo
the
notion
of
inspired
sleep
of
faces
charged
with
dreams
a
vast
fragment
of
marble
had
long
lain
below
the
loggia
of
orcagna
and
many
a
sculptor
had
had
his
thoughts
of
a
design
which
should
just
fill
this
famous
block
of
stone
cutting
the
diamond
as
it
were
without
loss
under
michelangelo
hand
it
became
the
david
which
stood
till
lately
on
the
steps
of
the
palazzo
vecchio
when
it
was
replaced
below
the
loggia
michelangelo
was
now
thirty
years
old
and
his
reputation
was
established
three
great
works
fill
the
remainder
of
his
life
three
works
often
interrupted
carried
on
through
a
thousand
hesitations
a
thousand
disappointments
quarrels
with
his
patrons
quarrels
with
his
family
quarrels
perhaps
most
of
all
with
himself
the
sistine
chapel
the
mausoleum
of
julius
the
second
and
the
sacristy
of
san
lorenzo
in
the
story
of
michelangelo
life
the
strength
often
turning
to
bitterness
is
not
far
to
seek
a
discordant
note
sounds
throughout
it
which
almost
spoils
the
music
he
treats
the
pope
as
the
king
of
france
himself
would
not
dare
to
treat
him
he
goes
along
the
streets
of
rome
like
an
executioner
raphael
says
of
him
once
he
seems
to
have
shut
himself
up
with
the
intention
of
starving
himself
to
death
as
we
come
in
reading
his
life
on
its
harsh
untempered
incidents
the
thought
again
and
again
arises
that
he
is
one
of
those
who
incur
the
judgment
of
dante
as
having
wilfully
lived
in
sadness
even
his
tenderness
and
pity
are
embittered
by
their
strength
what
passionate
weeping
in
that
mysterious
figure
which
in
the
creation
of
adam
crouches
below
the
image
of
the
almighty
as
he
comes
with
the
forms
of
things
to
be
woman
and
her
progeny
in
the
fold
of
his
garment
what
a
sense
of
wrong
in
those
two
captive
youths
who
feel
the
chains
like
scalding
water
on
their
proud
and
delicate
flesh
the
idealist
who
became
a
reformer
with
savonarola
and
a
republican
superintending
the
fortification
of
florence
the
nest
where
he
was
born
il
nido
ove
as
he
calls
it
once
in
a
sudden
throb
of
affection
in
its
last
struggle
for
liberty
yet
believed
always
that
he
had
imperial
blood
in
his
veins
and
was
of
the
kindred
of
the
great
matilda
had
within
the
depths
of
his
nature
some
secret
spring
of
indignation
or
sorrow
we
know
little
of
his
youth
but
all
tends
to
make
one
believe
in
the
vehemence
of
its
passions
beneath
the
platonic
calm
of
the
sonnets
there
is
latent
a
deep
delight
in
carnal
form
and
colour
there
and
still
more
in
the
madrigals
he
often
falls
into
the
language
of
less
tranquil
affections
while
some
of
them
have
the
colour
of
penitence
as
from
a
wanderer
returning
home
he
who
spoke
so
decisively
of
the
supremacy
in
the
imaginative
world
of
the
unveiled
human
form
had
not
been
always
we
may
think
a
mere
platonic
lover
vague
and
wayward
his
loves
may
have
been
but
they
partook
of
the
strength
of
his
nature
and
sometimes
it
may
be
would
by
no
means
become
music
so
that
the
comely
order
of
his
days
was
quite
put
out
par
che
amaro
ogni
mio
dolce
io
senta
but
his
genius
is
in
harmony
with
itself
and
just
as
in
the
products
of
his
art
we
find
resources
of
sweetness
within
their
exceeding
strength
so
in
his
own
story
also
bitter
as
the
ordinary
sense
of
it
may
be
there
are
select
pages
shut
in
among
the
rest
pages
one
might
easily
turn
over
too
lightly
but
which
yet
sweeten
the
whole
volume
the
interest
of
poems
is
that
they
make
us
spectators
of
this
struggle
the
struggle
of
a
strong
nature
to
adorn
and
attune
itself
the
struggle
of
a
desolating
passion
which
yearns
to
be
resigned
and
sweet
and
pensive
as
dante
was
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
occasional
and
informal
character
of
his
poetry
that
it
brings
us
nearer
to
himself
his
own
mind
and
temper
than
any
work
done
only
to
support
a
literary
reputation
could
possibly
do
his
letters
tell
us
little
that
is
worth
knowing
about
him
a
few
poor
quarrels
about
money
and
commissions
but
it
is
quite
otherwise
with
these
songs
and
sonnets
written
down
at
odd
moments
sometimes
on
the
margins
of
his
sketches
themselves
often
unfinished
sketches
arresting
some
salient
feeling
or
unpremeditated
idea
as
it
passed
and
it
happens
that
a
true
study
of
these
has
become
within
the
last
few
years
for
the
first
time
possible
a
few
of
the
sonnets
circulated
widely
in
manuscript
and
became
almost
within
michelangelo
own
lifetime
a
subject
of
academical
discourses
but
they
were
first
collected
in
a
volume
in
by
the
of
michelangelo
michelangelo
buonarroti
the
younger
he
omitted
much
the
sonnets
in
part
and
sometimes
compressed
two
or
more
compositions
into
one
always
losing
something
of
the
force
and
incisiveness
of
the
original
so
the
book
remained
neglected
even
by
italians
themselves
in
the
last
century
through
the
influence
of
that
french
taste
which
despised
all
compositions
of
the
kind
as
it
despised
and
neglected
dante
his
reputation
will
ever
be
on
the
increase
because
he
is
so
little
read
says
voltaire
of
but
in
the
last
of
the
buonarroti
bequeathed
to
the
municipality
of
florence
the
curiosities
of
his
family
among
them
was
a
precious
volume
containing
the
autograph
of
the
sonnets
a
learned
italian
signor
cesare
guasti
undertook
to
collate
this
autograph
with
other
manuscripts
at
the
vatican
and
elsewhere
and
in
published
a
true
version
of
michelangelo
poems
with
dissertations
and
a
paraphrase
people
have
often
spoken
of
these
poems
as
if
they
were
a
mere
cry
of
distress
a
lover
complaint
over
the
obduracy
of
vittoria
colonna
but
those
who
speak
thus
forget
that
though
it
is
quite
possible
that
michelangelo
had
seen
vittoria
that
somewhat
shadowy
figure
as
early
as
yet
their
closer
intimacy
did
not
begin
till
about
the
year
when
michelangelo
was
nearly
seventy
years
old
vittoria
herself
an
ardent
vowed
to
perpetual
widowhood
since
the
news
had
reached
her
seventeen
years
before
that
her
husband
the
youthful
and
princely
marquess
of
pescara
lay
dead
of
the
wounds
he
had
received
in
the
battle
of
pavia
was
then
no
longer
an
object
of
great
passion
in
a
dialogue
written
by
the
painter
francesco
d
ollanda
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
together
in
an
empty
church
at
rome
one
sunday
afternoon
discussing
indeed
the
characteristics
of
various
schools
of
art
but
still
more
the
writings
of
saint
paul
already
following
the
ways
and
tasting
the
sunless
pleasures
of
weary
people
whose
care
for
external
things
is
slackening
in
a
letter
still
extant
he
regrets
that
when
he
visited
her
after
death
he
had
kissed
her
hands
only
he
made
or
set
to
work
to
make
a
crucifix
for
her
use
and
two
drawings
perhaps
in
preparation
for
it
are
now
in
oxford
from
allusions
in
the
sonnets
we
may
divine
that
when
they
first
approached
each
other
he
had
debated
much
with
himself
whether
this
last
passion
would
be
the
most
unsoftening
the
most
desolating
of
all
un
dolce
amaro
un
sě
e
no
mi
muovi
is
it
carnal
affection
or
del
suo
prestino
stato
of
plato
state
il
raggio
ardente
the
older
conventional
criticism
dealing
with
the
text
of
had
lightly
assumed
that
all
or
nearly
all
the
sonnets
were
actually
addressed
to
vittoria
herself
but
signor
guasti
finds
only
four
or
at
most
five
which
can
be
so
attributed
on
genuine
authority
still
there
are
reasons
which
make
him
assign
the
majority
of
them
to
the
period
between
and
and
we
may
regard
the
volume
as
a
record
of
this
in
michelangelo
story
we
know
how
goethe
escaped
from
the
stress
of
sentiments
too
strong
for
him
by
making
a
book
about
them
and
for
michelangelo
to
write
down
his
passionate
thoughts
at
all
to
express
them
in
a
sonnet
was
already
in
some
measure
to
command
and
have
his
way
with
them
la
vita
del
mia
amor
non
č
il
cor
mio
ch
amor
di
quel
ch
io
t
amo
č
senza
core
it
was
just
because
vittoria
raised
no
great
passion
that
the
space
in
his
life
where
she
reigns
has
such
peculiar
suavity
and
the
spirit
of
the
sonnets
is
lost
if
we
once
take
them
out
of
that
dreamy
atmosphere
in
which
men
have
things
as
they
will
because
the
hold
of
all
outward
things
upon
them
is
faint
and
uncertain
their
prevailing
tone
is
a
calm
and
meditative
sweetness
the
cry
of
distress
is
indeed
there
but
as
a
mere
residue
a
trace
of
bracing
chalybeate
salt
just
discernible
in
the
song
which
rises
like
a
clear
sweet
spring
from
a
charmed
space
in
his
life
this
charmed
and
temperate
space
in
michelangelo
life
without
which
its
excessive
strength
would
have
been
so
imperfect
which
saves
him
from
the
judgment
of
dante
on
those
who
wilfully
lived
in
sadness
is
then
a
period
there
reaching
from
the
year
to
the
year
the
year
of
vittoria
death
in
it
the
lifelong
effort
to
tranquillise
his
vehement
emotions
by
withdrawing
them
into
the
region
of
ideal
sentiment
becomes
successful
and
the
significance
of
vittoria
is
that
she
realises
for
him
a
type
of
affection
which
even
in
disappointment
may
charm
and
sweeten
his
spirit
in
this
effort
to
tranquillise
and
sweeten
life
by
idealising
its
vehement
sentiments
there
were
two
great
traditional
types
either
of
which
an
italian
of
the
sixteenth
century
might
have
followed
there
was
dante
whose
little
book
of
the
vita
nuova
had
early
become
a
pattern
of
imaginative
love
maintained
somewhat
feebly
by
the
later
followers
of
petrarch
and
since
plato
had
become
something
more
than
a
name
in
italy
by
the
publication
of
the
latin
translation
of
his
works
by
marsilio
ficino
there
was
the
platonic
tradition
also
dante
belief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
through
which
even
in
heaven
beatrice
loses
for
him
no
tinge
of
or
fold
of
raiment
even
and
the
platonic
dream
of
the
passage
of
the
soul
through
one
form
of
life
after
another
with
its
passionate
haste
to
escape
from
the
burden
of
bodily
form
altogether
are
for
all
effects
of
art
or
poetry
principles
diametrically
opposite
now
it
is
the
platonic
tradition
rather
than
dante
that
has
moulded
verse
in
many
ways
no
sentiment
could
have
been
less
like
dante
love
for
beatrice
than
michelangelo
for
vittoria
colonna
dante
comes
in
early
youth
beatrice
is
a
child
with
the
wistful
ambiguous
vision
of
a
child
with
a
character
still
unaccentuated
by
the
influence
of
outward
circumstances
almost
expressionless
vittoria
on
the
other
hand
is
a
woman
already
weary
in
advanced
age
of
grave
intellectual
qualities
dante
story
is
a
piece
of
figured
work
inlaid
with
lovely
incidents
in
michelangelo
poems
frost
and
fire
are
almost
the
only
images
the
refining
fire
of
the
goldsmith
once
or
twice
the
phoenix
ice
melting
at
the
fire
fire
struck
from
the
rock
which
it
afterwards
consumes
except
one
doubtful
allusion
to
a
journey
there
are
almost
no
incidents
but
there
is
much
of
the
bright
sharp
unerring
skill
with
which
in
boyhood
he
gave
the
look
of
age
to
the
head
of
a
faun
by
chipping
a
tooth
from
its
jaw
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
hammer
for
dante
the
amiable
and
devout
materialism
of
the
middle
age
sanctifies
all
that
is
presented
by
hand
and
eye
while
michelangelo
is
always
pressing
forward
from
the
outward
beauty
il
bel
del
fuor
che
agli
occhi
piace
to
apprehend
the
unseen
beauty
trascenda
nella
forma
universale
that
abstract
form
of
beauty
about
which
the
platonists
reason
and
this
gives
the
impression
in
him
of
something
flitting
and
unfixed
of
the
houseless
and
complaining
spirit
almost
clairvoyant
through
the
frail
and
yielding
flesh
he
accounts
for
love
at
first
sight
by
a
previous
state
of
existence
la
dove
io
amai
prima
and
yet
there
are
many
points
in
which
he
is
really
like
dante
and
comes
very
near
to
the
original
image
beyond
those
later
and
feebler
followers
in
the
wake
of
petrarch
he
learns
from
dante
rather
than
from
plato
that
for
lovers
the
surfeiting
of
desire
ove
gran
desir
gran
copia
affrena
is
a
state
less
happy
than
poverty
with
abundance
of
hope
una
miseria
di
speranza
piena
he
recalls
him
in
the
repetition
of
the
words
gentile
and
cortesia
in
the
personification
of
amor
in
the
tendency
to
dwell
minutely
on
the
physical
effects
of
the
presence
of
a
beloved
object
on
the
pulses
and
the
heart
above
all
he
resembles
dante
in
the
warmth
and
intensity
of
his
political
utterances
for
the
lady
of
one
of
his
noblest
sonnets
was
from
the
first
understood
to
be
the
city
of
florence
and
he
avers
that
all
must
be
asleep
in
heaven
if
she
who
was
created
of
angelic
form
for
a
thousand
lovers
is
appropriated
by
one
alone
some
piero
or
alessandro
de
medici
once
and
again
he
introduces
love
and
death
who
dispute
concerning
him
for
like
dante
and
all
the
nobler
souls
of
italy
he
is
much
occupied
with
thoughts
of
the
grave
and
his
true
mistress
is
death
death
at
first
as
the
worst
of
all
sorrows
and
disgraces
with
a
clod
of
the
field
for
its
brain
afterwards
death
in
its
high
distinction
its
detachment
from
vulgar
needs
the
angry
stains
of
life
and
action
escaping
fast
some
of
those
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
this
man
because
the
gods
loved
him
lingered
on
to
be
of
immense
patriarchal
age
till
the
sweetness
it
had
taken
so
long
to
secrete
in
him
was
found
at
last
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
ex
forti
dulcedo
the
world
had
changed
around
him
the
new
catholicism
had
taken
the
place
of
the
renaissance
the
spirit
of
the
roman
church
had
changed
in
the
vast
world
cathedral
which
his
skill
had
helped
to
raise
for
it
it
looked
stronger
than
ever
some
of
the
first
members
of
the
oratory
were
among
his
intimate
associates
they
were
of
a
spirit
as
unlike
as
possible
from
that
of
lorenzo
or
savonarola
even
the
opposition
of
the
reformation
to
art
has
been
often
enlarged
upon
far
greater
was
that
of
the
catholic
revival
but
in
thus
fixing
itself
in
a
frozen
orthodoxy
the
roman
church
had
passed
beyond
him
and
he
was
a
stranger
to
it
in
earlier
days
when
its
beliefs
had
been
in
a
fluid
state
he
too
might
have
been
drawn
into
the
controversy
he
might
have
been
for
spiritualising
the
papal
sovereignty
like
savonarola
or
for
adjusting
the
dreams
of
plato
and
homer
with
the
words
of
christ
like
pico
of
mirandola
but
things
had
moved
onward
and
such
adjustments
were
no
longer
possible
for
himself
he
had
long
since
fallen
back
on
that
divine
ideal
which
above
the
wear
and
tear
of
creeds
has
been
forming
itself
for
ages
as
the
possession
of
nobler
souls
and
now
he
began
to
feel
the
soothing
influence
which
since
that
time
the
roman
church
has
often
exerted
over
spirits
too
independent
to
be
its
subjects
yet
brought
within
the
neighbourhood
of
its
action
consoled
and
tranquillised
as
a
traveller
might
be
resting
for
one
evening
in
a
strange
city
by
its
stately
aspect
and
the
sentiment
of
its
many
fortunes
just
because
with
those
fortunes
he
has
nothing
to
do
so
he
lingers
on
a
revenant
as
the
french
say
a
ghost
out
of
another
age
in
a
world
too
coarse
to
touch
his
faint
sensibilities
very
closely
dreaming
in
a
society
theatrical
in
its
life
theatrical
in
its
art
theatrical
even
in
its
devotion
on
the
morning
of
the
world
history
on
the
primitive
form
of
man
on
the
images
under
which
that
primitive
world
had
conceived
of
spiritual
forces
i
have
dwelt
on
the
thought
of
michelangelo
as
thus
lingering
beyond
his
time
in
a
world
not
his
own
because
if
one
is
to
distinguish
the
peculiar
savour
of
his
work
he
must
be
approached
not
through
his
followers
but
through
his
predecessors
not
through
the
marbles
of
saint
peter
but
through
the
work
of
the
sculptors
of
the
fifteenth
century
over
the
tombs
and
altars
of
tuscany
he
is
the
last
of
the
florentines
of
those
on
whom
the
peculiar
sentiment
of
the
florence
of
dante
and
giotto
descended
he
is
the
consummate
representative
of
the
form
that
sentiment
took
in
the
fifteenth
century
with
men
like
luca
signorelli
and
mino
da
fiesole
up
to
him
the
tradition
of
sentiment
is
unbroken
the
progress
towards
surer
and
more
mature
methods
of
expressing
that
sentiment
continuous
but
his
professed
disciples
did
not
share
this
temper
they
are
in
love
with
his
strength
only
and
seem
not
to
feel
his
grave
and
temperate
sweetness
theatricality
is
their
chief
characteristic
and
that
is
a
quality
as
little
attributable
to
michelangelo
as
to
mino
or
luca
signorelli
with
him
as
with
them
all
is
serious
passionate
impulsive
this
discipleship
of
michelangelo
this
dependence
of
his
on
the
tradition
of
the
florentine
schools
is
nowhere
seen
more
clearly
than
in
his
treatment
of
the
creation
the
creation
of
man
had
haunted
the
mind
of
the
middle
age
like
a
dream
and
weaving
it
into
a
hundred
carved
ornaments
of
capital
or
doorway
the
italian
sculptors
had
early
impressed
upon
it
that
pregnancy
of
expression
which
seems
to
give
it
many
veiled
meanings
as
with
other
artistic
conceptions
of
the
middle
age
its
treatment
became
almost
conventional
handed
on
from
artist
to
artist
with
slight
changes
till
it
came
to
have
almost
an
independent
and
abstract
existence
of
its
own
it
was
characteristic
of
the
medieval
mind
thus
to
give
an
independent
traditional
existence
to
a
special
pictorial
conception
or
to
a
legend
like
that
of
tristram
or
tannhäuser
or
even
to
the
very
thoughts
and
substance
of
a
book
like
the
imitation
so
that
no
single
workman
could
claim
it
as
his
own
and
the
book
the
image
the
legend
had
itself
a
legend
and
its
fortunes
and
a
personal
history
and
it
is
a
sign
of
the
medievalism
of
michelangelo
that
he
thus
receives
from
tradition
his
central
conception
and
does
but
add
the
last
touches
in
transferring
it
to
the
frescoes
of
the
sistine
chapel
but
there
was
another
tradition
of
those
earlier
more
serious
florentines
of
which
michelangelo
is
the
inheritor
to
which
he
gives
the
final
expression
and
which
centres
in
the
sacristy
of
san
lorenzo
as
the
tradition
of
the
creation
centres
in
the
sistine
chapel
it
has
been
said
that
all
the
great
florentines
were
preoccupied
with
death
is
the
burden
of
their
thoughts
from
dante
to
savonarola
even
the
gay
and
licentious
boccaccio
gives
a
keener
edge
to
his
stories
by
putting
them
in
the
mouths
of
a
party
of
people
who
had
taken
refuge
in
a
from
the
danger
of
death
by
plague
it
was
to
this
inherited
sentiment
this
practical
decision
that
to
be
preoccupied
with
the
thought
of
death
was
in
itself
dignifying
and
a
note
of
high
quality
that
the
seriousness
of
the
great
florentines
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
partly
due
and
it
was
reinforced
in
them
by
the
actual
sorrows
of
their
times
how
often
and
in
what
various
ways
had
they
seen
life
stricken
down
in
their
streets
and
houses

pazzi
conspirators
botticelli
is
employed
to
paint
their
portraits
this
preoccupation
with
serious
thoughts
and
sad
images
might
easily
have
resulted
as
it
did
for
instance
in
the
gloomy
villages
of
the
rhine
or
in
the
overcrowded
parts
of
medieval
paris
as
it
still
does
in
many
a
village
of
the
alps
in
something
merely
morbid
or
grotesque
in
the
danse
macabre
of
many
french
and
german
painters
or
the
grim
inventions
of
dürer
from
such
a
result
the
florentine
masters
of
the
fifteenth
century
were
saved
by
the
nobility
of
their
italian
culture
and
still
more
by
their
tender
pity
for
the
thing
itself
they
must
often
have
leaned
over
the
lifeless
body
when
all
was
at
length
quiet
and
smoothed
out
after
death
it
is
said
the
traces
of
slighter
and
more
superficial
dispositions
disappear
the
lines
become
more
simple
and
dignified
only
the
abstract
lines
remain
in
a
great
indifference
they
came
thus
to
see
death
in
its
distinction
then
following
it
perhaps
one
stage
further
dwelling
for
a
moment
on
the
point
where
all
this
transitory
dignity
must
break
up
and
discerning
with
no
clearness
a
new
body
they
paused
just
in
time
and
abstained
with
a
sentiment
of
profound
pity
of
all
this
sentiment
michelangelo
is
the
achievement
and
first
of
all
of
pity
pietŕ
pity
the
pity
of
the
virgin
mother
over
the
dead
body
of
christ
expanded
into
the
pity
of
all
mothers
over
all
dead
sons
the
entombment
with
its
cruel
hard
stones
this
is
the
subject
of
his
predilection
he
has
left
it
in
many
forms
sketches
designs
finished
and
unfinished
groups
of
sculpture
but
always
as
a
hopeless
rayless
almost
heathen
sorrow
no
divine
sorrow
but
mere
pity
and
awe
at
the
stiff
limbs
and
colourless
lips
there
is
a
drawing
of
his
at
oxford
in
which
the
dead
body
has
sunk
to
the
earth
between
the
mother
feet
with
the
arms
extended
over
her
knees
the
tombs
in
the
sacristy
of
san
lorenzo
are
memorials
not
of
any
of
the
nobler
and
greater
medici
but
of
giuliano
and
lorenzo
the
younger
noticeable
chiefly
for
their
somewhat
early
death
it
is
mere
human
nature
therefore
which
has
prompted
the
sentiment
here
the
titles
assigned
traditionally
to
the
four
symbolical
figures
night
and
day
the
twilight
and
the
dawn
are
far
too
definite
for
them
for
these
figures
come
much
nearer
to
the
mind
and
spirit
of
their
author
and
are
a
more
direct
expression
of
his
thoughts
than
any
merely
symbolical
conceptions
could
possibly
have
been
they
concentrate
and
express
less
by
way
of
definite
conceptions
than
by
the
touches
the
promptings
of
a
piece
of
music
all
those
vague
fancies
misgivings
presentiments
which
shift
and
mix
and
are
defined
and
fade
again
whenever
the
thoughts
try
to
fix
themselves
with
sincerity
on
the
conditions
and
surroundings
of
the
disembodied
spirit
i
suppose
no
one
would
come
to
the
sacristy
of
san
lorenzo
for
consolation
for
seriousness
for
solemnity
for
dignity
of
impression
perhaps
but
not
for
consolation
it
is
a
place
neither
of
consoling
nor
of
terrible
thoughts
but
of
vague
and
wistful
speculation
here
again
michelangelo
is
the
disciple
not
so
much
of
dante
as
of
the
platonists
dante
belief
in
immortality
is
formal
precise
and
firm
almost
as
much
so
as
that
of
a
child
who
thinks
the
dead
will
hear
if
you
cry
loud
enough
but
in
michelangelo
you
have
maturity
the
mind
of
the
grown
man
dealing
cautiously
and
dispassionately
with
serious
things
and
what
hope
he
has
is
based
on
the
consciousness
of
ignorance
ignorance
of
man
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
mind
its
origin
and
capacities
michelangelo
is
so
ignorant
of
the
spiritual
world
of
the
new
body
and
its
laws
that
he
does
not
surely
know
whether
the
consecrated
host
may
not
be
the
body
of
christ
and
of
all
that
range
of
sentiment
he
is
the
poet
a
poet
still
alive
and
in
possession
of
our
inmost
thoughts
dumb
inquiry
over
the
relapse
after
death
into
the
formlessness
which
preceded
life
the
change
the
revolt
from
that
change
then
the
correcting
hallowing
consoling
rush
of
pity
at
last
far
off
thin
and
vague
yet
not
more
vague
than
the
most
definite
thoughts
men
have
had
through
three
centuries
on
a
matter
that
has
been
so
near
their
hearts
the
new
body
a
passing
light
a
mere
intangible
external
effect
over
those
too
rigid
or
too
formless
faces
a
dream
that
lingers
a
moment
retreating
in
the
dawn
incomplete
aimless
helpless
a
thing
with
faint
hearing
faint
memory
faint
power
of
touch
a
breath
a
flame
in
the
doorway
a
feather
in
the
wind
the
qualities
of
the
great
masters
in
art
or
literature
the
combination
of
those
qualities
the
laws
by
which
they
moderate
support
relieve
each
other
are
not
peculiar
to
them
but
most
often
typical
standards
or
revealing
instances
of
the
laws
by
which
certain
aesthetic
effects
are
produced
the
old
masters
indeed
are
simpler
their
characteristics
are
written
larger
and
are
easier
to
read
than
the
analogues
of
them
in
all
the
mixed
confused
productions
of
the
modern
mind
but
when
once
we
have
succeeded
in
defining
for
ourselves
those
characteristics
and
the
law
of
their
combination
we
have
acquired
a
standard
or
measure
which
helps
us
to
put
in
its
right
place
many
a
vagrant
genius
many
an
unclassified
talent
many
precious
though
imperfect
products
of
art
it
is
so
with
the
components
of
the
true
character
of
michelangelo
that
strange
interfusion
of
sweetness
and
strength
is
not
to
be
found
in
those
who
claimed
to
be
his
followers
but
it
is
found
in
many
of
those
who
worked
before
him
and
in
many
others
down
to
our
own
time
in
william
blake
for
instance
and
victor
hugo
who
though
not
of
his
school
and
unaware
are
his
true
sons
and
help
us
to
understand
him
as
he
in
turn
interprets
and
justifies
them
perhaps
this
is
the
chief
use
in
studying
old
masters
leonardo
da
vinci
homo
minister
et
interpres
naturae
in
vasari
life
of
leonardo
da
vinci
as
we
now
read
it
there
are
some
variations
from
the
first
edition
there
the
painter
who
has
fixed
the
outward
type
of
christ
for
succeeding
centuries
was
a
bold
speculator
holding
lightly
by
other
men
beliefs
setting
philosophy
above
christianity
words
of
his
trenchant
enough
to
justify
this
impression
are
not
recorded
and
would
have
been
out
of
keeping
with
a
genius
of
which
one
characteristic
is
the
tendency
to
lose
itself
in
a
refined
and
graceful
mystery
the
suspicion
was
but
the
mode
in
which
the
world
stamps
its
appreciation
of
one
who
has
thoughts
for
himself
alone
his
high
indifference
his
intolerance
of
the
common
forms
of
things
and
in
the
second
edition
the
image
was
changed
into
something
fainter
and
more
conventional
but
it
is
still
by
a
certain
mystery
in
his
work
and
something
enigmatical
beyond
the
usual
measure
of
great
men
that
he
fascinates
or
perhaps
half
repels
his
life
is
one
of
sudden
revolts
with
intervals
in
which
he
works
not
at
all
or
apart
from
the
main
scope
of
his
work
by
a
strange
fortune
the
pictures
on
which
his
more
popular
fame
rested
disappeared
early
from
the
world
like
the
battle
of
the
standard
or
are
mixed
obscurely
with
the
product
of
meaner
hands
like
the
last
supper
his
type
of
beauty
is
so
exotic
that
it
fascinates
a
larger
number
than
it
delights
and
seems
more
than
that
of
any
other
artist
to
reflect
ideas
and
views
and
some
scheme
of
the
world
within
so
that
he
seemed
to
his
contemporaries
to
be
the
possessor
of
some
unsanctified
and
secret
wisdom
as
to
michelet
and
others
to
have
anticipated
modern
ideas
he
trifles
with
his
genius
and
crowds
all
his
chief
work
into
a
few
tormented
years
of
later
life
yet
he
is
so
possessed
by
his
genius
that
he
passes
unmoved
through
the
most
tragic
events
overwhelming
his
country
and
friends
like
one
who
comes
across
them
by
chance
on
some
secret
errand
his
legend
as
the
french
say
with
the
anecdotes
which
every
one
remembers
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
chapters
of
vasari
later
writers
merely
copied
it
until
in
carlo
amoretti
applied
to
it
a
criticism
which
left
hardly
a
date
fixed
and
not
one
of
those
anecdotes
untouched
the
various
questions
thus
raised
have
since
that
time
become
one
after
another
subjects
of
special
study
and
mere
antiquarianism
has
in
this
direction
little
more
to
do
for
others
remain
the
editing
of
the
thirteen
books
of
his
manuscripts
and
the
separation
by
technical
criticism
of
what
in
his
reputed
works
is
really
his
from
what
is
only
half
his
or
the
work
of
his
pupils
but
a
lover
of
strange
souls
may
still
analyse
for
himself
the
impression
made
on
him
by
those
works
and
try
to
reach
through
it
a
definition
of
the
chief
elements
of
leonardo
genius
the
legend
as
corrected
and
enlarged
by
its
critics
may
now
and
then
intervene
to
support
the
results
of
this
analysis
his
life
has
three
divisions
thirty
years
at
florence
nearly
twenty
years
at
milan
then
nineteen
years
of
wandering
till
he
sinks
to
rest
under
the
protection
of
francis
the
first
at
the
château
de
clou
the
dishonour
of
illegitimacy
hangs
over
his
birth
piero
antonio
his
father
was
of
a
noble
florentine
house
of
vinci
in
the
val
and
leonardo
brought
up
delicately
among
the
true
children
of
that
house
was
the
of
his
youth
with
the
keen
puissant
nature
such
children
often
have
we
see
him
in
his
boyhood
fascinating
all
men
by
his
beauty
improvising
music
and
songs
buying
the
caged
birds
and
setting
them
free
as
he
walked
the
streets
of
florence
fond
of
odd
bright
dresses
and
spirited
horses
from
his
earliest
years
he
designed
many
objects
and
constructed
models
in
relief
of
which
vasari
mentions
some
of
women
smiling
his
father
pondering
over
this
promise
in
the
child
took
him
to
the
workshop
of
andrea
del
verrocchio
then
the
most
famous
artist
in
florence
beautiful
objects
lay
about
there
reliquaries
pyxes
silver
images
for
the
chapel
at
rome
strange
of
the
middle
age
keeping
odd
company
with
fragments
of
antiquity
then
but
lately
discovered
another
student
leonardo
may
have
seen
there
a
lad
into
whose
soul
the
level
light
and
aërial
illusions
of
italian
sunsets
had
passed
in
after
days
famous
as
perugino
verrocchio
was
an
artist
of
the
earlier
florentine
type
carver
painter
and
worker
in
metals
in
one
designer
not
of
pictures
only
but
of
all
things
for
sacred
or
household
use
ambries
instruments
of
music
making
them
all
fair
to
look
upon
filling
the
common
ways
of
life
with
the
reflexion
of
some
brightness
and
years
of
patience
had
refined
his
hand
till
his
work
was
now
sought
after
from
distant
places
it
happened
that
verrocchio
was
employed
by
the
brethren
of
vallombrosa
to
paint
the
baptism
of
christ
and
leonardo
was
allowed
to
finish
an
angel
in
the
corner
it
was
one
of
those
moments
in
which
the
progress
of
a
great
thing
here
that
of
the
art
of
italy
presses
hard
on
the
happiness
of
an
individual
through
whose
discouragement
and
decrease
humanity
in
more
fortunate
persons
comes
a
step
nearer
to
its
final
success
for
beneath
the
cheerful
exterior
of
the
mere
craftsman
chasing
brooches
for
the
copes
of
santa
maria
novella
or
twisting
metal
screens
for
the
tombs
of
the
medici
lay
the
ambitious
desire
to
expand
the
destiny
of
italian
art
by
a
larger
knowledge
and
insight
into
things
a
purpose
in
art
not
unlike
leonardo
still
unconscious
purpose
and
often
in
the
modelling
of
drapery
or
of
a
lifted
arm
or
of
hair
cast
back
from
the
face
there
came
to
him
something
of
the
freer
manner
and
richer
humanity
of
a
later
age
but
in
this
baptism
the
pupil
had
surpassed
the
master
and
verrocchio
turned
away
as
one
stunned
and
as
if
his
sweet
earlier
work
must
thereafter
be
distasteful
to
him
from
the
bright
animated
angel
of
hand
the
angel
may
still
be
seen
in
florence
a
space
of
sunlight
in
the
cold
laboured
old
picture
but
the
legend
is
true
only
in
sentiment
for
painting
had
always
been
the
art
by
which
verrocchio
set
least
store
and
as
in
a
sense
he
anticipates
leonardo
so
to
the
last
leonardo
recalls
the
studio
of
verrocchio
in
the
love
of
beautiful
toys
such
as
the
vessel
of
water
for
a
mirror
and
lovely
about
the
implicated
hands
in
the
modesty
and
vanity
and
of
reliefs
like
those
cameos
which
in
the
virgin
of
the
balances
hang
all
round
the
girdle
of
saint
michael
and
of
bright
variegated
stones
such
as
the
agates
in
the
saint
anne
and
in
a
hieratic
preciseness
and
grace
as
of
a
sanctuary
swept
and
garnished
amid
all
the
cunning
and
intricacy
of
his
lombard
manner
this
never
left
him
much
of
it
there
must
have
been
in
that
lost
picture
of
paradise
which
he
prepared
as
a
cartoon
for
tapestry
to
be
woven
in
the
looms
of
flanders
it
was
the
perfection
of
the
older
florentine
style
of
with
patient
putting
of
each
leaf
upon
the
trees
and
each
flower
in
the
grass
where
the
first
man
and
woman
were
standing
and
because
it
was
the
perfection
of
that
style
it
awoke
in
leonardo
some
seed
of
discontent
which
lay
in
the
secret
places
of
his
nature
for
the
way
to
perfection
is
through
a
series
of
disgusts
and
this
picture
all
that
he
had
done
so
far
in
his
life
at
florence
was
after
all
in
the
old
slight
manner
his
art
if
it
was
to
be
something
in
the
world
must
be
weighted
with
more
of
the
meaning
of
nature
and
purpose
of
humanity
nature
was
the
true
mistress
of
higher
intelligences
he
plunged
then
into
the
study
of
nature
and
in
doing
this
he
followed
the
manner
of
the
older
students
he
brooded
over
the
hidden
virtues
of
plants
and
crystals
the
lines
traced
by
the
stars
as
they
moved
in
the
sky
over
the
correspondences
which
exist
between
the
different
orders
of
living
things
through
which
to
eyes
opened
they
interpret
each
other
and
for
years
he
seemed
to
those
about
him
as
one
listening
to
a
voice
silent
for
other
men
he
learned
here
the
art
of
going
deep
of
tracking
the
sources
of
expression
to
their
subtlest
retreats
the
power
of
an
intimate
presence
in
the
things
he
handled
he
did
not
at
once
or
entirely
desert
his
art
only
he
was
no
longer
the
cheerful
objective
painter
through
whose
soul
as
through
clear
glass
the
bright
figures
of
florentine
life
only
made
a
little
mellower
and
more
pensive
by
the
transit
passed
on
to
the
white
wall
he
wasted
many
days
in
curious
tricks
of
design
seeming
to
lose
himself
in
the
spinning
of
intricate
devices
of
line
and
colour
he
was
smitten
with
a
love
of
the
impossible
the
perforation
of
mountains
changing
the
course
of
rivers
raising
great
buildings
such
as
the
church
of
san
giovanni
in
the
air
all
those
feats
for
the
performance
of
which
natural
magic
professed
to
have
the
key
later
writers
indeed
see
in
these
efforts
an
anticipation
of
modern
mechanics
in
him
they
were
rather
dreams
thrown
off
by
the
overwrought
and
labouring
brain
two
ideas
were
especially
confirmed
in
him
as
reflexes
of
things
that
had
touched
his
brain
in
childhood
beyond
the
depth
of
other
impressions
the
smiling
of
women
and
the
motion
of
great
waters
and
in
such
studies
some
interfusion
of
the
extremes
of
beauty
and
terror
shaped
itself
as
an
image
that
might
be
seen
and
touched
in
the
mind
of
this
gracious
youth
so
fixed
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
it
never
left
him
as
if
catching
glimpses
of
it
in
the
strange
eyes
or
hair
of
chance
people
he
would
follow
such
about
the
streets
of
florence
till
the
sun
went
down
of
whom
many
sketches
of
his
remain
some
of
these
are
full
of
a
curious
beauty
that
remote
beauty
which
may
be
apprehended
only
by
those
who
have
sought
it
carefully
who
starting
with
acknowledged
types
of
beauty
have
refined
as
far
upon
these
as
these
refine
upon
the
world
of
common
forms
but
mingled
inextricably
with
this
there
is
an
element
of
mockery
also
so
that
whether
in
sorrow
or
scorn
he
caricatures
dante
even
legions
of
grotesques
sweep
under
his
hand
for
has
not
nature
too
her
grotesques
the
rent
rock
the
distorting
lights
of
evening
on
lonely
roads
the
unveiled
structure
of
man
in
the
embryo
or
the
skeleton
all
these
swarming
fancies
unite
in
the
medusa
of
the
uffizii
vasari
story
of
an
earlier
medusa
painted
on
a
wooden
shield
is
perhaps
an
invention
and
yet
properly
told
has
more
of
the
air
of
truth
about
it
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
legend
for
its
real
subject
is
not
the
serious
work
of
a
man
but
the
experiment
of
a
child
the
lizards
and
and
other
strange
small
creatures
which
haunt
an
italian
vineyard
bring
before
one
the
whole
picture
of
a
child
life
in
a
tuscan
dwelling
half
castle
half
farm
and
are
as
true
to
nature
as
the
pretended
astonishment
of
the
father
for
whom
the
boy
has
prepared
a
surprise
it
was
not
in
play
that
he
painted
that
other
medusa
the
one
great
picture
which
he
left
behind
him
in
florence
the
subject
has
been
treated
in
various
ways
leonardo
alone
cuts
to
its
centre
he
alone
realises
it
as
the
head
of
a
corpse
exercising
its
powers
through
all
the
circumstances
of
death
what
may
be
called
the
fascination
of
corruption
penetrates
in
every
touch
its
exquisitely
finished
beauty
about
the
dainty
lines
of
the
cheek
the
bat
flits
unheeded
the
delicate
snakes
seem
literally
strangling
each
other
in
terrified
struggle
to
escape
from
the
medusa
brain
the
hue
which
violent
death
always
brings
with
it
is
in
the
features
features
singularly
massive
and
grand
as
we
catch
them
inverted
in
a
dexterous
foreshortening
crown
foremost
like
a
great
calm
stone
against
which
the
wave
of
serpents
breaks
the
science
of
that
age
was
all
divination
clairvoyance
unsubjected
to
our
exact
modern
formulas
seeking
in
an
instant
of
vision
to
concentrate
a
thousand
experiences
later
writers
thinking
only
of
the
treatise
on
painting
which
a
frenchman
raffaelle
du
fresne
a
hundred
years
afterwards
compiled
from
leonardo
bewildered
manuscripts
written
strangely
as
his
manner
was
from
right
to
left
have
imagined
a
rigid
order
in
his
inquiries
but
this
rigid
order
would
have
been
little
in
accordance
with
the
restlessness
of
his
character
and
if
we
think
of
him
as
the
mere
reasoner
who
subjects
design
to
anatomy
and
composition
to
mathematical
rules
we
shall
hardly
have
that
impression
which
those
around
leonardo
received
from
him
poring
over
his
crucibles
making
experiments
with
colour
trying
by
a
strange
variation
of
the
alchemist
dream
to
discover
the
secret
not
of
an
elixir
to
make
man
natural
life
immortal
but
of
giving
immortality
to
the
subtlest
and
most
delicate
effects
of
painting
he
seemed
to
them
rather
the
sorcerer
or
the
magician
possessed
of
curious
secrets
and
a
hidden
knowledge
living
in
a
world
of
which
he
alone
possessed
the
key
what
his
philosophy
seems
to
have
been
most
like
is
that
of
paracelsus
or
cardan
and
much
of
the
spirit
of
the
older
alchemy
still
hangs
about
it
with
its
confidence
in
short
cuts
and
odd
byways
to
knowledge
to
him
philosophy
was
to
be
something
giving
strange
swiftness
and
double
sight
divining
the
sources
of
springs
beneath
the
earth
or
of
expression
beneath
the
human
countenance
clairvoyant
of
occult
gifts
in
common
or
uncommon
things
in
the
reed
at
the
or
the
star
which
draws
near
to
us
but
once
in
a
century
how
in
this
way
the
clear
purpose
was
overclouded
the
fine
chaser
hand
perplexed
we
but
dimly
see
the
mystery
which
at
no
point
quite
lifts
from
leonardo
life
is
deepest
here
but
it
is
certain
that
at
one
period
of
his
life
he
had
almost
ceased
to
be
an
artist
the
year
the
year
of
the
birth
of
raphael
and
the
first
of
leonardo
life
is
fixed
as
the
date
of
his
visit
to
milan
by
the
letter
in
which
he
recommends
himself
to
ludovico
sforza
and
offers
to
tell
him
for
a
price
strange
secrets
in
the
art
of
war
it
was
that
sforza
who
murdered
his
young
nephew
by
slow
poison
yet
was
so
susceptible
of
religious
impressions
that
he
blended
mere
earthly
passion
with
a
sort
of
religious
sentimentalism
and
who
took
for
his
device
the
symbol
in
its
long
delay
and
sudden
yielding
of
flowers
and
fruit
together
of
a
wisdom
which
economises
all
forces
for
an
opportunity
of
sudden
and
sure
effect
the
fame
of
leonardo
had
gone
before
him
and
he
was
to
model
a
colossal
statue
of
francesco
the
first
duke
of
milan
as
for
leonardo
himself
he
came
not
as
an
artist
at
all
or
careful
of
the
fame
of
one
but
as
a
player
on
the
harp
a
strange
harp
of
silver
of
his
own
construction
shaped
in
some
curious
likeness
to
a
horse
skull
the
capricious
spirit
of
ludovico
was
susceptible
also
to
the
power
of
music
and
leonardo
nature
had
a
kind
of
spell
in
it
fascination
is
always
the
word
descriptive
of
him
no
portrait
of
his
youth
remains
but
all
tends
to
make
us
believe
that
up
to
this
time
some
charm
of
voice
and
aspect
strong
enough
to
balance
the
disadvantage
of
his
birth
had
played
about
him
his
physical
strength
was
great
it
was
said
that
he
could
bend
a
horseshoe
like
a
coil
of
lead
the
duomo
work
of
artists
from
beyond
the
alps
so
fantastic
to
the
eye
of
a
florentine
used
to
the
mellow
unbroken
surfaces
of
giotto
and
arnolfo
was
then
in
all
its
freshness
and
below
in
the
streets
of
milan
moved
a
people
as
fantastic
changeful
and
dreamlike
to
leonardo
least
of
all
men
could
there
be
anything
poisonous
in
the
exotic
flowers
of
sentiment
which
grew
there
it
was
a
life
of
brilliant
sins
and
exquisite
amusements
leonardo
became
a
celebrated
designer
of
pageants
and
it
suited
the
quality
of
his
genius
composed
in
almost
equal
parts
of
curiosity
and
the
desire
of
beauty
to
take
things
as
they
came
curiosity
and
the
desire
of
beauty
these
are
the
two
elementary
forces
in
leonardo
genius
curiosity
often
in
conflict
with
the
desire
of
beauty
but
generating
in
union
with
it
a
type
of
subtle
and
curious
grace
the
movement
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
twofold
partly
the
renaissance
partly
also
the
coming
of
what
is
called
the
modern
spirit
with
its
realism
its
appeal
to
experience
it
comprehended
a
return
to
antiquity
and
a
return
to
nature
raphael
represents
the
return
to
antiquity
and
leonardo
the
return
to
nature
in
this
return
to
nature
he
was
seeking
to
satisfy
a
boundless
curiosity
by
her
perpetual
surprises
a
microscopic
sense
of
finish
by
her
finesse
or
delicacy
of
operation
that
subtilitas
naturae
which
bacon
notices
so
we
find
him
often
in
intimate
relations
with
men
of
science
with
fra
luca
paccioli
the
mathematician
and
the
anatomist
marc
antonio
della
torre
his
observations
and
experiments
fill
thirteen
volumes
of
manuscript
and
those
who
can
judge
describe
him
as
anticipating
long
before
by
rapid
intuition
the
later
ideas
of
science
he
explained
the
obscure
light
of
the
unilluminated
part
of
the
moon
knew
that
the
sea
had
once
covered
the
mountains
which
contain
shells
and
of
the
gathering
of
the
equatorial
waters
above
the
polar
he
who
thus
penetrated
into
the
most
secret
parts
of
nature
preferred
always
the
more
to
the
less
remote
what
seeming
exceptional
was
an
instance
of
law
more
refined
the
construction
about
things
of
a
peculiar
atmosphere
and
mixed
lights
he
paints
flowers
with
such
curious
felicity
that
different
writers
have
attributed
to
him
a
fondness
for
particular
flowers
as
clement
the
cyclamen
and
rio
the
jasmin
while
at
venice
there
is
a
stray
leaf
from
his
portfolio
dotted
all
over
with
studies
of
violets
and
the
wild
rose
in
him
first
appears
the
taste
for
what
is
bizarre
or
recherché
in
landscape
hollow
places
full
of
the
green
shadow
of
bituminous
rocks
ridged
reefs
of
which
cut
the
water
into
quaint
sheets
of
light
their
exact
antitype
is
in
our
own
western
seas
all
the
solemn
effects
of
moving
water
you
may
follow
it
springing
from
its
distant
source
among
the
rocks
on
the
heath
of
the
madonna
of
the
balances
passing
as
a
little
fall
into
the
treacherous
calm
of
the
madonna
of
the
lake
as
a
goodly
river
next
below
the
cliffs
of
the
madonna
of
the
rocks
washing
the
white
walls
of
its
distant
villages
stealing
out
in
a
network
of
divided
streams
in
la
gioconda
to
the
seashore
of
the
saint
anne
that
delicate
place
where
the
wind
passes
like
the
hand
of
some
fine
etcher
over
the
surface
and
the
untorn
shells
are
lying
thick
upon
the
sand
and
the
tops
of
the
rocks
to
which
the
waves
never
rise
are
green
with
grass
grown
fine
as
hair
it
is
the
landscape
not
of
dreams
or
of
fancy
but
of
places
far
withdrawn
and
hours
selected
from
a
thousand
with
a
miracle
of
finesse
through
strange
veil
of
sight
things
reach
him
so
in
no
ordinary
night
or
day
but
as
in
faint
light
of
eclipse
or
in
some
brief
interval
of
falling
rain
at
daybreak
or
through
deep
water
and
not
into
nature
only
but
he
plunged
also
into
human
personality
and
became
above
all
a
painter
of
portraits
faces
of
a
modelling
more
skilful
than
has
been
seen
before
or
since
embodied
with
a
reality
which
almost
amounts
to
illusion
on
the
dark
air
to
take
a
character
as
it
was
and
delicately
sound
its
stops
suited
one
so
curious
in
observation
curious
in
invention
he
painted
thus
the
portraits
of
ludovico
mistresses
lucretia
crivelli
and
cecilia
galerani
the
poetess
of
ludovico
himself
and
the
duchess
beatrice
the
portrait
of
cecilia
galerani
is
lost
but
that
of
lucretia
crivelli
has
been
identified
with
la
belle
feroničre
of
the
louvre
and
ludovico
pale
anxious
face
still
remains
in
the
ambrosian
library
opposite
is
the
portrait
of
beatrice
in
whom
leonardo
seems
to
have
caught
some
presentiment
of
early
death
painting
her
precise
and
grave
full
of
the
refinement
of
the
dead
in
sad
raiment
set
with
pale
stones
sometimes
this
curiosity
came
in
conflict
with
the
desire
of
beauty
it
tended
to
make
him
go
too
far
below
that
outside
of
things
in
which
art
really
begins
and
ends
this
struggle
between
the
reason
and
its
ideas
and
the
senses
the
desire
of
beauty
is
the
key
to
leonardo
life
at
milan
his
restlessness
his
endless
his
odd
experiments
with
colour
how
much
must
he
leave
unfinished
how
much
recommence
his
problem
was
the
transmutation
of
ideas
into
images
what
he
had
attained
so
far
had
been
the
mastery
of
that
earlier
florentine
style
with
its
naďve
and
limited
sensuousness
now
he
was
to
entertain
in
this
narrow
medium
those
divinations
of
a
humanity
too
wide
for
it
that
larger
vision
of
the
opening
world
which
is
only
not
too
much
for
the
great
irregular
art
of
shakespeare
and
everywhere
the
effort
is
visible
in
the
work
of
his
hands
this
agitation
this
perpetual
delay
give
him
an
air
of
weariness
and
ennui
to
others
he
seems
to
be
aiming
at
an
impossible
effect
to
do
something
that
art
that
painting
can
never
do
often
the
expression
of
physical
beauty
at
this
or
that
point
seems
strained
and
marred
in
the
effort
as
in
those
heavy
german
foreheads
too
heavy
and
german
for
perfect
beauty
for
there
was
a
touch
of
germany
in
that
genius
which
as
goethe
said
had
thought
itself
weary
müde
sich
gedacht
what
an
anticipation
of
modern
germany
for
instance
in
that
debate
on
the
question
whether
sculpture
or
painting
is
the
nobler
art
but
there
is
this
difference
between
him
and
the
german
that
with
all
that
curious
science
the
german
would
have
thought
nothing
more
was
needed
the
name
of
goethe
himself
reminds
one
how
great
for
the
artist
may
be
the
danger
of
overmuch
science
how
goethe
who
in
the
elective
affinities
and
the
first
part
of
faust
does
transmute
ideas
into
images
who
wrought
many
such
transmutations
did
not
invariably
find
the
and
in
the
second
part
of
faust
presents
us
with
a
mass
of
science
which
has
almost
no
artistic
character
at
all
but
leonardo
will
never
work
till
the
happy
moment
comes
that
moment
of
which
to
imaginative
men
is
a
moment
of
invention
on
this
he
waits
with
a
perfect
patience
other
moments
are
but
a
preparation
or
of
it
few
men
distinguish
between
them
as
jealously
as
he
hence
so
many
flaws
even
in
the
choicest
work
but
for
leonardo
the
distinction
is
absolute
and
in
the
moment
of
the
alchemy
complete
the
idea
is
stricken
into
colour
and
imagery
a
cloudy
mysticism
is
refined
to
a
subdued
and
graceful
mystery
and
painting
pleases
the
eye
while
it
satisfies
the
soul
this
curious
beauty
is
seen
above
all
in
his
drawings
and
in
these
chiefly
in
the
abstract
grace
of
the
bounding
lines
let
us
take
some
of
these
drawings
and
pause
over
them
awhile
and
first
one
of
those
at
florence
the
heads
of
a
woman
and
a
little
child
set
side
by
side
but
each
in
its
own
separate
frame
first
of
all
there
is
much
pathos
in
the
reappearance
in
the
fuller
curves
of
the
face
of
the
child
of
the
sharper
more
chastened
lines
of
the
worn
and
older
face
which
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
heads
are
those
of
a
little
child
and
its
mother
a
feeling
for
maternity
is
indeed
always
characteristic
of
leonardo
and
this
feeling
is
further
indicated
here
by
the
pathos
of
the
diminutive
rounded
shoulders
of
the
child
you
may
note
a
like
pathetic
power
in
drawings
of
a
young
man
seated
in
a
stooping
posture
his
face
in
his
hands
as
in
sorrow
of
a
slave
sitting
in
an
uneasy
inclined
attitude
in
some
brief
interval
of
rest
of
a
small
madonna
and
child
peeping
sideways
in
terror
as
a
mighty
griffin
with
batlike
wings
one
of
finest
inventions
descends
suddenly
from
the
air
to
snatch
up
a
great
wild
beast
wandering
near
them
but
note
in
these
as
that
which
especially
belongs
to
art
the
contour
of
the
young
hair
the
poise
of
the
slave
arm
above
his
head
and
the
curves
of
the
head
of
the
child
following
the
little
skull
within
thin
and
fine
as
some
worn
by
the
wind
take
again
another
head
still
more
full
of
sentiment
but
of
a
different
kind
a
little
drawing
in
red
chalk
which
every
one
will
remember
who
has
examined
at
all
carefully
the
drawings
by
old
masters
at
the
louvre
it
is
a
face
of
doubtful
sex
set
in
the
shadow
of
its
own
hair
the
in
high
light
against
it
with
something
voluptuous
and
full
in
the
and
the
lips
another
drawing
might
pass
for
the
same
face
in
childhood
with
parched
and
feverish
lips
but
much
sweetness
in
the
loose
waisted
childish
dress
with
necklace
and
bulla
and
in
the
daintily
bound
hair
we
might
take
the
thread
of
suggestion
which
these
two
drawings
offer
when
thus
set
side
by
side
and
following
it
through
the
drawings
at
florence
venice
and
milan
construct
a
sort
of
series
illustrating
better
than
anything
else
leonardo
type
of
womanly
beauty
daughters
of
herodias
with
their
fantastic
knotted
and
folded
so
strangely
to
leave
the
dainty
oval
of
the
face
disengaged
they
are
not
of
the
christian
family
or
of
raphael
they
are
the
clairvoyants
through
whom
as
through
delicate
instruments
one
becomes
aware
of
the
subtler
forces
of
nature
and
the
modes
of
their
action
all
that
is
magnetic
in
it
all
those
finer
conditions
wherein
material
things
rise
to
that
subtlety
of
operation
which
constitutes
them
spiritual
where
only
the
final
nerve
and
the
keener
touch
can
follow
it
is
as
if
in
certain
significant
examples
we
actually
saw
those
forces
at
their
work
on
human
flesh
nervous
electric
faint
always
with
some
inexplicable
faintness
these
people
seem
to
be
subject
to
exceptional
conditions
to
feel
powers
at
work
in
the
common
air
unfelt
by
others
to
become
as
it
were
the
receptacle
of
them
and
pass
them
on
to
us
in
a
chain
of
secret
influences
but
among
the
more
youthful
heads
there
is
one
at
florence
which
love
chooses
for
its
own
the
head
of
a
young
man
which
may
well
be
the
likeness
of
andrea
salaino
beloved
of
leonardo
for
his
curled
and
waving
hair
belli
capelli
ricci
e
inanellati
and
afterwards
his
favourite
pupil
and
servant
of
all
the
interests
in
living
men
and
women
which
may
have
filled
his
life
at
milan
this
attachment
alone
is
recorded
and
in
return
salaino
identified
himself
so
entirely
with
leonardo
that
the
picture
of
saint
anne
in
the
louvre
has
been
attributed
to
him
it
illustrates
leonardo
usual
choice
of
pupils
men
of
some
natural
charm
of
person
or
intercourse
like
salaino
or
men
of
birth
and
princely
habits
of
life
like
francesco
melzi
men
with
just
enough
genius
to
be
capable
of
initiation
into
his
secret
for
the
sake
of
which
they
were
ready
to
efface
their
own
individuality
among
them
retiring
often
to
the
villa
of
the
melzi
at
canonica
al
vaprio
he
worked
at
his
fugitive
manuscripts
and
sketches
working
for
the
present
hour
and
for
a
few
only
perhaps
chiefly
for
himself
other
artists
have
been
as
careless
of
present
or
future
applause
in
or
because
they
set
moral
or
political
ends
above
the
ends
of
art
but
in
him
this
solitary
culture
of
beauty
seems
to
have
hung
upon
a
kind
of
and
a
carelessness
in
the
work
of
art
of
all
but
art
itself
out
of
the
secret
places
of
a
unique
temperament
he
brought
strange
blossoms
and
fruits
hitherto
unknown
and
for
him
the
novel
impression
conveyed
the
exquisite
effect
woven
counted
as
an
end
in
itself
a
perfect
end
and
these
pupils
of
his
acquired
his
manner
so
thoroughly
that
though
the
number
of
leonardo
authentic
works
is
very
small
indeed
there
is
a
multitude
of
other
men
pictures
through
which
we
undoubtedly
see
him
and
come
very
near
to
his
genius
sometimes
as
in
the
little
picture
of
the
madonna
of
the
balances
in
which
from
the
bosom
of
his
mother
christ
weighs
the
pebbles
of
the
brook
against
the
sins
of
men
we
have
a
hand
rough
enough
by
contrast
working
upon
some
fine
hint
or
sketch
of
his
sometimes
as
in
the
subjects
of
the
daughter
of
herodias
and
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
the
lost
originals
have
been
and
varied
upon
again
and
again
by
luini
and
others
at
other
times
the
original
remains
but
has
been
a
mere
theme
or
motive
a
type
of
which
the
accessories
might
be
modified
or
changed
and
these
variations
have
but
brought
out
the
more
the
purpose
or
expression
of
the
original
it
is
so
with
the
saint
john
the
baptist
of
the
louvre
one
of
the
few
naked
figures
leonardo
painted
whose
delicate
brown
flesh
and
woman
hair
no
one
would
go
out
into
the
wilderness
to
seek
and
whose
treacherous
smile
would
have
us
understand
something
far
beyond
the
outward
gesture
or
circumstance
but
the
long
reedlike
cross
in
the
hand
which
suggests
saint
john
the
baptist
becomes
faint
in
a
copy
at
the
ambrosian
library
and
disappears
altogether
in
another
version
in
the
palazzo
rosso
at
genoa
returning
from
the
latter
to
the
original
we
are
no
longer
surprised
by
saint
john
strange
likeness
to
the
bacchus
which
hangs
near
it
and
which
set
théophile
gautier
thinking
of
heine
notion
of
decayed
gods
who
to
maintain
themselves
after
the
fall
of
paganism
took
employment
in
the
new
religion
we
recognise
one
of
those
symbolical
inventions
in
which
the
ostensible
subject
is
used
not
as
matter
for
definite
pictorial
realisation
but
as
the
of
a
train
of
sentiment
subtle
and
vague
as
a
piece
of
music
no
one
ever
ruled
over
the
mere
subject
in
hand
more
entirely
than
leonardo
or
bent
it
more
dexterously
to
purely
artistic
ends
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
though
he
handles
sacred
subjects
continually
he
is
the
most
profane
of
painters
the
given
person
or
subject
saint
john
in
the
desert
or
the
virgin
on
the
knees
of
saint
anne
is
often
merely
the
pretext
for
a
kind
of
work
which
carries
one
altogether
beyond
the
range
of
its
conventional
associations
about
the
last
supper
its
decay
and
restorations
a
whole
literature
has
risen
up
goethe
pensive
sketch
of
its
sad
fortunes
being
perhaps
the
best
the
death
in
childbirth
of
the
duchess
beatrice
was
followed
in
ludovico
by
one
of
those
paroxysms
of
religious
feeling
which
in
him
were
constitutional
the
low
gloomy
dominican
church
of
saint
mary
of
the
graces
had
been
the
favourite
oratory
of
beatrice
she
had
spent
her
last
days
there
full
of
sinister
presentiments
at
last
it
had
been
almost
necessary
to
remove
her
from
it
by
force
and
now
it
was
here
that
mass
was
said
a
hundred
times
a
day
for
her
repose
on
the
damp
wall
of
the
refectory
oozing
with
mineral
salts
leonardo
painted
the
last
supper
effective
anecdotes
were
told
about
it
his
retouchings
and
delays
they
show
him
refusing
to
work
except
at
the
moment
of
invention
scornful
of
any
one
who
supposed
that
art
could
be
a
work
of
mere
industry
and
rule
often
coming
the
whole
length
of
milan
to
give
a
single
touch
he
painted
it
not
in
fresco
where
all
must
be
impromptu
but
in
oils
the
new
method
which
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
welcome
because
it
allowed
of
so
many
so
refined
a
working
out
of
perfection
it
turned
out
that
on
a
plastered
wall
no
process
could
have
been
less
durable
within
fifty
years
it
had
fallen
into
decay
and
now
we
have
to
turn
back
to
leonardo
own
studies
above
all
to
one
drawing
of
the
central
head
at
the
brera
which
in
a
union
of
tenderness
and
severity
in
the
reminds
one
of
the
monumental
work
of
mino
da
fiesole
to
trace
it
as
it
was
here
was
another
effort
to
lift
a
given
subject
out
of
the
range
of
its
traditional
associations
strange
after
all
the
mystic
developments
of
the
middle
age
was
the
effort
to
see
the
eucharist
not
as
the
pale
host
of
the
altar
but
as
one
taking
leave
of
his
friends
five
years
afterwards
the
young
raphael
at
florence
painted
it
with
sweet
and
solemn
effect
in
the
refectory
of
saint
onofrio
but
still
with
all
the
mystical
unreality
of
the
school
of
perugino
vasari
pretends
that
the
central
head
was
never
finished
but
finished
or
unfinished
or
owing
part
of
its
effect
to
a
mellowing
decay
the
head
of
jesus
does
but
consummate
the
sentiment
of
the
whole
company
ghosts
through
which
you
see
the
wall
faint
as
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
upon
the
wall
on
autumn
afternoons
this
figure
is
but
the
faintest
the
most
spectral
of
them
all
the
last
supper
was
finished
in
in
the
french
entered
milan
and
whether
or
not
the
gascon
bowmen
used
it
as
a
mark
for
their
arrows
the
model
of
francesco
sforza
certainly
did
not
survive
what
in
that
age
such
work
was
capable
of
being
of
what
nobility
amid
what
racy
truthfulness
to
fact
we
may
judge
from
the
bronze
statue
of
bartolomeo
colleoni
on
horseback
modelled
by
leonardo
master
verrocchio
he
died
of
grief
it
was
said
because
the
mould
accidentally
failing
he
was
unable
to
complete
it
still
standing
in
the
piazza
of
saint
john
and
saint
paul
at
venice
some
traces
of
the
thing
may
remain
in
certain
of
leonardo
drawings
and
perhaps
also
by
a
singular
circumstance
in
a
town
of
france
for
ludovico
became
a
prisoner
and
ended
his
days
at
loches
in
touraine
after
many
years
of
captivity
in
the
dungeons
below
where
all
seems
sick
with
barbarous
feudal
memories
he
was
allowed
at
last
it
is
said
to
breathe
fresher
air
for
awhile
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
great
tower
still
shown
its
walls
covered
with
strange
painted
arabesques
ascribed
by
tradition
to
his
hand
amused
a
little
in
this
way
through
the
tedious
years
in
those
vast
helmets
and
human
faces
and
pieces
of
armour
among
which
in
great
letters
the
motto
infelix
sum
is
woven
in
and
out
it
is
perhaps
not
too
fanciful
to
see
the
fruit
of
a
wistful
dreaming
over
leonardo
sundry
experiments
on
the
armed
figure
of
the
great
duke
which
had
occupied
the
two
so
much
during
the
days
of
their
good
fortune
at
milan
the
remaining
years
of
leonardo
life
are
more
or
less
years
of
wandering
from
his
brilliant
life
at
court
he
had
saved
nothing
and
he
returned
to
florence
a
poor
man
perhaps
necessity
kept
his
spirit
excited
the
next
four
years
are
one
prolonged
rapture
or
ecstasy
of
invention
he
painted
now
the
pictures
of
the
louvre
his
most
authentic
works
which
came
there
straight
from
the
cabinet
of
francis
the
first
at
fontainebleau
one
picture
of
his
the
saint
anne
not
the
saint
anne
of
the
louvre
but
a
simple
cartoon
now
in
london
revived
for
a
moment
a
sort
of
appreciation
more
common
in
an
earlier
time
when
good
pictures
had
still
seemed
miraculous
for
two
days
a
crowd
of
people
of
all
qualities
passed
in
naďve
excitement
through
the
chamber
where
it
hung
and
gave
leonardo
a
taste
of
the
triumph
of
cimabue
but
his
work
was
less
with
the
saints
than
with
the
living
women
of
florence
for
he
lived
still
in
the
polished
society
that
he
loved
and
in
the
houses
of
florence
left
perhaps
a
little
subject
to
light
thoughts
by
the
death
of
savonarola
the
latest
gossip
is
of
an
undraped
monna
lisa
found
in
some
corner
of
the
late
orleans
collection
he
saw
ginevra
di
benci
and
lisa
the
young
third
wife
of
francesco
del
giocondo
as
we
have
seen
him
using
incidents
of
sacred
story
not
for
their
own
sake
or
as
mere
subjects
for
pictorial
realisation
but
as
a
cryptic
language
for
fancies
all
his
own
so
now
he
found
a
vent
for
his
thought
in
taking
one
of
these
languid
women
and
raising
her
as
leda
or
pomona
as
modesty
or
vanity
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
symbolical
expression
la
gioconda
is
in
the
truest
sense
leonardo
masterpiece
the
revealing
instance
of
his
mode
of
thought
and
work
in
suggestiveness
only
the
melancholia
of
dürer
is
comparable
to
it
and
no
crude
symbolism
disturbs
the
effect
of
its
subdued
and
graceful
mystery
we
all
know
the
face
and
hands
of
the
figure
set
in
its
marble
chair
in
that
circle
of
fantastic
rocks
as
in
some
faint
light
under
sea
perhaps
of
all
ancient
pictures
time
has
chilled
it
least
as
often
happens
with
works
in
which
invention
seems
to
reach
its
limit
there
is
an
element
in
it
given
to
not
invented
by
the
master
in
that
inestimable
folio
of
drawings
once
in
the
possession
of
vasari
were
certain
designs
by
verrocchio
faces
of
such
impressive
beauty
that
leonardo
in
his
boyhood
copied
them
many
times
it
is
hard
not
to
connect
with
these
designs
of
the
elder
master
as
with
its
germinal
principle
the
unfathomable
smile
always
with
a
touch
of
something
sinister
in
it
which
plays
over
all
leonardo
work
besides
the
picture
is
a
portrait
from
childhood
we
see
this
image
defining
itself
on
the
fabric
of
his
dreams
and
but
for
express
historical
testimony
we
might
fancy
that
this
was
but
his
ideal
lady
embodied
and
beheld
at
last
what
was
the
relationship
of
a
living
florentine
to
this
creature
of
his
thought
by
what
strange
affinities
had
the
dream
and
the
person
grown
up
thus
apart
and
yet
so
closely
together
present
from
the
first
incorporeally
in
leonardo
brain
dimly
traced
in
the
designs
of
verrocchio
she
is
found
present
at
last
in
il
giocondo
house
that
there
is
much
of
mere
portraiture
in
the
picture
is
attested
by
the
legend
that
by
artificial
means
the
presence
of
mimes
and
that
subtle
expression
was
protracted
on
the
face
again
was
it
in
four
years
and
by
renewed
labour
never
really
completed
or
in
four
months
and
as
by
stroke
of
magic
that
the
image
was
projected
the
presence
that
rose
thus
so
strangely
beside
the
waters
is
expressive
of
what
in
the
ways
of
a
thousand
years
men
had
come
to
desire
hers
is
the
head
upon
which
all
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come
and
the
eyelids
are
a
little
weary
it
is
a
beauty
wrought
out
from
within
upon
the
flesh
the
deposit
little
cell
by
cell
of
strange
thoughts
and
fantastic
reveries
and
exquisite
passions
set
it
for
a
moment
beside
one
of
those
white
greek
goddesses
or
beautiful
women
of
antiquity
and
how
would
they
be
troubled
by
this
beauty
into
which
the
soul
with
all
its
maladies
has
passed
all
the
thoughts
and
experience
of
the
world
have
etched
and
moulded
there
in
that
which
they
have
of
power
to
refine
and
make
expressive
the
outward
form
the
animalism
of
greece
the
lust
of
rome
the
mysticism
of
the
middle
age
with
its
spiritual
ambition
and
imaginative
loves
the
return
of
the
pagan
world
the
sins
of
the
borgias
she
is
older
than
the
rocks
among
which
she
sits
like
the
vampire
she
has
been
dead
many
times
and
learned
the
secrets
of
the
grave
and
has
been
a
diver
in
deep
seas
and
keeps
their
fallen
day
about
her
and
trafficked
for
strange
webs
with
eastern
merchants
and
as
leda
was
the
mother
of
helen
of
troy
and
as
saint
anne
the
mother
of
mary
and
all
this
has
been
to
her
but
as
the
sound
of
lyres
and
flutes
and
lives
only
in
the
delicacy
with
which
it
has
moulded
the
changing
lineaments
and
tinged
the
eyelids
and
the
hands
the
fancy
of
a
perpetual
life
sweeping
together
ten
thousand
experiences
is
an
old
one
and
modern
philosophy
has
conceived
the
idea
of
humanity
as
wrought
upon
by
and
summing
up
in
itself
all
modes
of
thought
and
life
certainly
lady
lisa
might
stand
as
the
embodiment
of
the
old
fancy
the
symbol
of
the
modern
idea
during
these
years
at
florence
leonardo
history
is
the
history
of
his
art
for
himself
he
is
lost
in
the
bright
cloud
of
it
the
outward
history
begins
again
in
with
a
wild
journey
through
central
italy
which
he
makes
as
the
chief
engineer
of
caesar
borgia
the
biographer
putting
together
the
stray
jottings
of
his
manuscripts
may
follow
him
through
every
day
of
it
up
the
strange
tower
of
siena
elastic
like
a
bent
bow
down
to
the
seashore
at
piombino
each
place
appearing
as
fitfully
as
in
a
fever
dream
one
other
great
work
was
left
for
him
to
do
a
work
all
trace
of
which
soon
vanished
the
battle
of
the
standard
in
which
he
had
michelangelo
for
his
rival
the
citizens
of
florence
desiring
to
decorate
the
walls
of
the
great
had
offered
the
work
for
competition
and
any
subject
might
be
chosen
from
the
florentine
wars
of
the
fifteenth
century
michelangelo
chose
for
his
cartoon
an
incident
of
the
war
with
pisa
in
which
the
florentine
soldiers
bathing
in
the
arno
are
surprised
by
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
run
to
arms
his
design
has
reached
us
only
in
an
old
engraving
which
helps
us
less
perhaps
than
our
remembrance
of
the
background
of
his
holy
family
in
the
uffizii
to
imagine
in
what
superhuman
form
such
as
might
have
beguiled
the
heart
of
an
earlier
world
those
figures
ascended
out
of
the
water
leonardo
chose
an
incident
from
the
battle
of
anghiari
in
which
two
parties
of
soldiers
fight
for
a
standard
like
michelangelo
his
cartoon
is
lost
and
has
come
to
us
only
in
sketches
and
in
a
fragment
of
rubens
through
the
accounts
given
we
may
discern
some
lust
of
terrible
things
in
it
so
that
even
the
horses
tore
each
other
with
their
teeth
and
yet
one
fragment
of
it
in
a
drawing
of
his
at
florence
is
far
different
a
waving
field
of
lovely
armour
the
chased
edgings
running
like
lines
of
sunlight
from
side
to
side
michelangelo
was
seven
years
old
leonardo
more
than
fifty
and
raphael
then
nineteen
years
of
age
visiting
florence
for
the
first
time
came
and
watched
them
as
they
worked
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
leonardo
again
at
rome
in
surrounded
by
his
mirrors
and
vials
and
furnaces
making
strange
toys
that
seemed
alive
of
wax
and
quicksilver
the
hesitation
which
had
haunted
him
all
through
life
and
made
him
like
one
under
a
spell
was
upon
him
now
with
double
force
no
one
had
ever
carried
political
indifferentism
farther
it
had
always
been
his
philosophy
to
fly
before
the
storm
he
is
for
the
sforzas
or
against
them
as
the
tide
of
their
fortune
turns
yet
now
in
the
political
society
of
rome
he
came
to
be
suspected
of
secret
french
sympathies
it
paralysed
him
to
find
himself
among
enemies
and
he
turned
wholly
to
france
which
had
long
courted
him
france
was
about
to
become
an
italy
more
italian
than
italy
itself
francis
the
first
like
lewis
the
twelfth
before
him
was
attracted
by
the
finesse
of
leonardo
work
la
gioconda
was
already
in
his
cabinet
and
he
offered
leonardo
the
little
château
de
clou
with
its
vineyards
and
meadows
in
the
pleasant
valley
of
the
masse
just
outside
the
walls
of
the
town
of
amboise
where
especially
in
the
hunting
season
the
court
then
frequently
resided
a
monsieur
lyonard
peinteur
du
roy
pour
amboyse
so
the
letter
of
francis
the
first
is
headed
it
opens
a
prospect
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
history
of
art
where
in
a
peculiarly
blent
atmosphere
italian
art
dies
away
as
a
french
exotic
two
questions
remain
after
much
busy
antiquarianism
concerning
leonardo
death
the
question
of
the
exact
form
of
his
religion
and
the
question
whether
francis
the
first
was
present
at
the
time
they
are
of
about
equally
little
importance
in
the
estimate
of
leonardo
genius
the
directions
in
his
will
concerning
the
thirty
masses
and
the
great
candles
for
the
church
of
saint
florentin
are
things
of
course
their
real
purpose
being
immediate
and
practical
and
on
no
theory
of
religion
could
these
hurried
offices
be
of
much
consequence
we
forget
them
in
speculating
how
one
who
had
been
always
so
desirous
of
beauty
but
desired
it
always
in
such
precise
and
definite
forms
as
hands
or
flowers
or
hair
looked
forward
now
into
the
vague
land
and
experienced
the
last
curiosity
notes
princely
how
characteristic
of
leonardo
the
answer
quanto
piů
un
arte
porta
seco

di

tanto

č

return
for
vasari
there
was
some
further
magic
of
crimson
in
the
lips
and
cheeks
lost
for
us
with
eastern
merchants
is
the
punctuation
used
in
the
macmillan
edition
macmillan
library
edition
erroneously
uses
a
space
followed
only
by
a
period
the
norton
anthology
editors
emend
the
text
to
contain
a
comma
after
merchants
rather
than
a
colon
but
i
have
chosen
to
follow
the
unusual
but
seemingly
correct
punctuation
the
school
of
giorgione
it
is
the
mistake
of
much
popular
criticism
to
regard
poetry
music
and
painting
all
the
various
products
of
art
as
but
translations
into
different
languages
of
one
and
the
same
fixed
quantity
of
imaginative
thought
supplemented
by
certain
technical
qualities
of
colour
in
painting
of
sound
in
music
of
rhythmical
words
in
poetry
in
this
way
the
sensuous
element
in
art
and
with
it
almost
everything
in
art
that
is
essentially
artistic
is
made
a
matter
of
indifference
and
a
clear
apprehension
of
the
opposite
principle
that
the
sensuous
material
of
each
art
brings
with
it
a
special
phase
or
quality
of
beauty
untranslatable
into
the
forms
of
any
other
an
order
of
impressions
distinct
in
kind
is
the
beginning
of
all
true
aesthetic
criticism
for
as
art
addresses
not
pure
sense
still
less
the
pure
intellect
but
the
imaginative
reason
through
the
senses
there
are
differences
of
kind
in
aesthetic
beauty
corresponding
to
the
differences
in
kind
of
the
gifts
of
sense
themselves
each
art
therefore
having
its
own
peculiar
and
untranslatable
sensuous
charm
has
its
own
special
mode
of
reaching
the
imagination
its
own
special
responsibilities
to
its
material
one
of
the
functions
of
aesthetic
criticism
is
to
define
these
limitations
to
estimate
the
degree
in
which
a
given
work
of
art
fulfils
its
responsibilities
to
its
special
material
to
note
in
a
picture
that
true
pictorial
charm
which
is
neither
a
mere
poetical
thought
or
sentiment
on
the
one
hand
nor
a
mere
result
of
communicable
technical
skill
in
colour
or
design
on
the
other
to
define
in
a
poem
that
true
poetical
quality
which
is
neither
descriptive
nor
meditative
merely
but
comes
of
an
inventive
handling
of
rhythmical
language
the
element
of
song
in
the
singing
to
note
in
music
the
musical
charm
that
essential
music
which
presents
no
words
no
matter
of
sentiment
or
thought
separable
from
the
special
form
in
which
it
is
conveyed
to
us
to
such
a
philosophy
of
the
variations
of
the
beautiful
analysis
of
the
spheres
of
sculpture
and
poetry
in
the
laocoon
was
an
important
contribution
but
a
true
appreciation
of
these
things
is
possible
only
in
the
light
of
a
whole
system
of
such
casuistries
now
painting
is
the
art
in
the
criticism
of
which
this
truth
most
needs
enforcing
for
it
is
in
popular
judgments
on
pictures
that
the
false
generalisation
of
all
art
into
forms
of
poetry
is
most
prevalent
to
suppose
that
all
is
mere
technical
acquirement
in
delineation
or
touch
working
through
and
addressing
itself
to
the
intelligence
on
the
one
side
or
a
merely
poetical
or
what
may
be
called
literary
interest
addressed
also
to
the
pure
intelligence
on
the
other
this
is
the
way
of
most
spectators
and
of
many
critics
who
have
never
caught
sight
all
the
time
of
that
true
pictorial
quality
which
lies
between
unique
pledge
as
it
is
of
the
possession
of
the
pictorial
gift
that
inventive
or
creative
handling
of
pure
line
and
colour
which
as
almost
always
in
dutch
painting
as
often
also
in
the
works
of
titian
or
veronese
is
quite
independent
of
anything
definitely
poetical
in
the
subject
it
accompanies
it
is
the
drawing
the
design
projected
from
that
peculiar
pictorial
temperament
or
constitution
in
which
while
it
may
possibly
be
ignorant
of
true
anatomical
proportions
all
things
whatever
all
poetry
all
ideas
however
abstract
or
obscure
float
up
as
visible
scene
or
image
it
is
the
colouring
that
weaving
of
light
as
of
just
perceptible
gold
threads
through
the
dress
the
flesh
the
atmosphere
in
that
staining
of
the
whole
fabric
of
the
thing
with
a
new
delightful
physical
quality
this
drawing
then
the
arabesque
traced
in
the
air
by
tintoret
flying
figures
by
titian
forest
branches
this
colouring
the
magic
conditions
of
light
and
hue
in
the
atmosphere
of
titian
or
descent
from
the
cross
these
essential
pictorial
qualities
must
first
of
all
delight
the
sense
delight
it
as
directly
and
sensuously
as
a
fragment
of
venetian
glass
and
through
this
delight
alone
become
the
vehicle
of
whatever
poetry
or
science
may
lie
beyond
them
in
the
intention
of
the
composer
in
its
primary
aspect
a
great
picture
has
no
more
definite
message
for
us
than
an
accidental
play
of
sunlight
and
shadow
for
a
few
moments
on
the
wall
or
floor
is
itself
in
truth
a
space
of
such
fallen
light
caught
as
the
colours
are
in
an
eastern
carpet
but
refined
upon
and
dealt
with
more
subtly
and
exquisitely
than
by
nature
itself
and
this
primary
and
essential
condition
fulfilled
we
may
trace
the
coming
of
poetry
into
painting
by
fine
gradations
upwards
from
japanese
for
instance
where
we
get
first
only
abstract
colour
then
just
a
little
interfused
sense
of
the
poetry
of
flowers
then
sometimes
perfect
and
so
onwards
until
in
titian
we
have
as
his
poetry
in
the
ariadne
so
actually
a
touch
of
true
childlike
humour
in
the
diminutive
quaint
figure
with
its
silk
gown
which
ascends
the
temple
stairs
in
his
picture
of
the
presentation
of
the
virgin
at
venice
but
although
each
art
has
thus
its
own
specific
order
of
impressions
and
an
untranslatable
charm
while
a
just
apprehension
of
the
ultimate
differences
of
the
arts
is
the
beginning
of
aesthetic
criticism
yet
it
is
noticeable
that
in
its
special
mode
of
handling
its
given
material
each
art
may
be
observed
to
pass
into
the
condition
of
some
other
art
by
what
german
critics
term
an
a
partial
alienation
from
its
own
limitations
through
which
the
arts
are
able
not
indeed
to
supply
the
place
of
each
other
but
reciprocally
to
lend
each
other
new
forces
thus
some
of
the
most
delightful
music
seems
to
be
always
approaching
to
figure
to
pictorial
definition
architecture
again
though
it
has
its
own
laws
laws
esoteric
enough
as
the
true
architect
knows
only
too
well
yet
sometimes
aims
at
fulfilling
the
conditions
of
a
picture
as
in
the
arena
chapel
or
of
sculpture
as
in
the
flawless
unity
of
giotto
tower
at
florence
and
often
finds
a
true
poetry
as
in
those
strangely
twisted
staircases
of
the
châteaux
of
the
country
of
the
loire
as
if
it
were
intended
that
among
their
odd
turnings
the
actors
in
a
theatrical
mode
of
life
might
pass
each
other
unseen
there
being
a
poetry
also
of
memory
and
of
the
mere
effect
of
time
by
which
architecture
often
profits
greatly
thus
again
sculpture
aspires
out
of
the
hard
limitation
of
pure
form
towards
colour
or
its
equivalent
poetry
also
in
many
ways
finding
guidance
from
the
other
arts
the
analogy
between
a
greek
tragedy
and
a
work
of
greek
sculpture
between
a
sonnet
and
a
relief
of
french
poetry
generally
with
the
art
of
engraving
being
more
than
mere
figures
of
speech
and
all
the
arts
in
common
aspiring
towards
the
principle
of
music
music
being
the
typical
or
ideally
consummate
art
the
object
of
the
great
of
all
art
of
all
that
is
artistic
or
partakes
of
artistic
qualities
all
art
constantly
aspires
towards
the
condition
of
music
for
while
in
all
other
kinds
of
art
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
the
matter
from
the
form
and
the
understanding
can
always
make
this
distinction
yet
it
is
the
constant
effort
of
art
to
obliterate
it
that
the
mere
matter
of
a
poem
for
instance
its
subject
namely
its
given
incidents
or
situation
that
the
mere
matter
of
a
picture
the
actual
circumstances
of
an
event
the
actual
topography
of
a
landscape
should
be
nothing
without
the
form
the
spirit
of
the
handling
that
this
form
this
mode
of
handling
should
become
an
end
in
itself
should
penetrate
every
part
of
the
matter
this
is
what
all
art
constantly
strives
after
and
achieves
in
different
degrees
this
abstract
language
becomes
clear
enough
if
we
think
of
actual
examples
in
an
actual
landscape
we
see
a
long
white
road
lost
suddenly
on
the
that
is
the
matter
of
one
of
the
etchings
of
alphonse
legros
only
in
this
etching
it
is
informed
by
an
indwelling
solemnity
of
expression
seen
upon
it
or
within
the
limits
of
an
exceptional
moment
or
caught
from
his
own
mood
perhaps
but
which
he
maintains
as
the
very
essence
of
the
thing
throughout
his
work
sometimes
a
momentary
tint
of
stormy
light
may
invest
a
homely
or
too
familiar
scene
with
a
character
which
might
well
have
been
drawn
from
the
deep
places
of
the
imagination
then
we
might
say
that
this
particular
effect
of
light
this
sudden
inweaving
of
gold
thread
through
the
texture
of
the
haystack
and
the
poplars
and
the
grass
gives
the
scene
artistic
qualities
that
it
is
like
a
picture
and
such
tricks
of
circumstance
are
commonest
in
landscape
which
has
little
salient
character
of
its
own
because
in
such
scenery
all
the
material
details
are
so
easily
absorbed
by
that
informing
expression
of
passing
light
and
elevated
throughout
their
whole
extent
to
a
new
and
delightful
effect
by
it
and
hence
the
superiority
for
most
conditions
of
the
picturesque
of
a
in
france
to
a
swiss
valley
because
on
the
french
mere
topography
the
simple
material
counts
for
so
little
and
all
being
very
pure
untouched
and
tranquil
in
itself
mere
light
and
shade
have
such
easy
work
in
modulating
it
to
one
dominant
tone
the
venetian
landscape
on
the
other
hand
has
in
its
material
conditions
much
which
is
hard
or
harshly
definite
but
the
masters
of
the
venetian
school
have
shown
themselves
little
burdened
by
them
of
its
alpine
background
they
retain
certain
abstracted
elements
only
of
cool
colour
and
tranquillising
line
and
they
use
its
actual
details
the
brown
windy
turrets
the
fields
the
forest
arabesques
but
as
the
notes
of
a
music
which
duly
accompanies
the
presence
of
their
men
and
women
presenting
us
with
the
spirit
or
essence
only
of
a
certain
sort
of
landscape
a
country
of
the
pure
reason
or
memory
poetry
again
works
with
words
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
the
pure
intelligence
and
it
deals
most
often
with
a
definite
subject
or
situation
sometimes
it
may
find
a
noble
and
quite
legitimate
function
in
the
conveyance
of
moral
or
political
aspiration
as
often
in
the
poetry
of
victor
hugo
in
such
instances
it
is
easy
enough
for
the
understanding
to
distinguish
between
the
matter
and
the
form
however
much
the
matter
the
subject
the
element
which
is
addressed
to
the
mere
intelligence
has
been
penetrated
by
the
informing
artistic
spirit
but
the
ideal
types
of
poetry
are
those
in
which
this
distinction
is
reduced
to
its
minimum
so
that
lyrical
poetry
precisely
because
in
it
we
are
least
able
to
detach
the
matter
from
the
form
without
a
deduction
of
something
from
that
matter
itself
is
at
least
artistically
the
highest
and
most
complete
form
of
poetry
and
the
very
perfection
of
such
poetry
often
appears
to
depend
in
part
on
a
certain
suppression
or
vagueness
of
mere
subject
so
that
the
meaning
reaches
us
through
ways
not
distinctly
traceable
by
the
understanding
as
in
some
of
the
most
imaginative
compositions
of
william
blake
and
often
in
shakespeare
songs
as
eminently
in
that
song
of
mariana
page
in
measure
for
measure
in
which
the
kindling
force
and
poetry
of
the
whole
play
seems
to
pass
for
a
moment
into
an
actual
strain
of
music
and
this
principle
holds
good
of
all
things
that
partake
in
any
degree
of
artistic
qualities
of
the
furniture
of
our
houses
and
of
dress
for
instance
of
life
itself
of
gesture
and
speech
and
the
details
of
daily
intercourse
these
also
for
the
wise
being
susceptible
of
a
suavity
and
charm
caught
from
the
way
in
which
they
are
done
which
gives
them
a
worth
in
themselves
herein
again
lies
what
is
valuable
and
justly
attractive
in
what
is
called
the
fashion
of
a
time
which
elevates
the
trivialities
of
speech
and
manner
and
dress
into
ends
in
themselves
and
gives
them
a
mysterious
grace
and
attractiveness
in
the
doing
of
them
art
then
is
thus
always
striving
to
be
independent
of
the
mere
intelligence
to
become
a
matter
of
pure
perception
to
get
rid
of
its
responsibilities
to
its
subject
or
material
the
ideal
examples
of
poetry
and
painting
being
those
in
which
the
constituent
elements
of
the
composition
are
so
welded
together
that
the
material
or
subject
no
longer
strikes
the
intellect
only
nor
the
form
the
eye
or
the
ear
only
but
form
and
matter
in
their
union
or
identity
present
one
single
effect
to
the
imaginative
reason
that
complex
faculty
for
which
every
thought
and
feeling
is
with
its
sensible
analogue
or
symbol
it
is
the
art
of
music
which
most
completely
realises
this
artistic
ideal
this
perfect
identification
of
matter
and
form
in
its
consummate
moments
the
end
is
not
distinct
from
the
means
the
form
from
the
matter
the
subject
from
the
expression
they
inhere
in
and
completely
saturate
each
other
and
to
it
therefore
to
the
condition
of
its
perfect
moments
all
the
arts
may
be
supposed
constantly
to
tend
and
aspire
in
music
then
rather
than
in
poetry
is
to
be
found
the
true
type
or
measure
of
perfected
art
therefore
although
each
art
has
its
incommunicable
element
its
untranslatable
order
of
impressions
its
unique
mode
of
reaching
the
imaginative
reason
yet
the
arts
may
be
represented
as
continually
struggling
after
the
law
or
principle
of
music
to
a
condition
which
music
alone
completely
realises
and
one
of
the
chief
functions
of
aesthetic
criticism
dealing
with
the
products
of
art
new
or
old
is
to
estimate
the
degree
in
which
each
of
those
products
approaches
in
this
sense
to
musical
law
by
no
school
of
painters
have
the
necessary
limitations
of
the
art
of
painting
been
so
unerringly
though
instinctively
apprehended
and
the
essence
of
what
is
pictorial
in
a
picture
so
justly
conceived
as
by
the
school
of
venice
and
the
train
of
thought
suggested
in
what
has
been
now
said
is
perhaps
a
not
unfitting
introduction
to
a
few
pages
about
giorgione
who
though
much
has
been
taken
by
recent
criticism
from
what
was
reputed
to
be
his
work
yet
more
entirely
than
any
other
painter
sums
up
in
what
we
know
of
himself
and
his
art
the
spirit
of
the
venetian
school
the
beginnings
of
venetian
painting
link
themselves
to
the
last
stiff
splendours
of
byzantine
decoration
and
are
but
the
introduction
into
the
crust
of
marble
and
gold
on
the
walls
of
the
duomo
of
murano
or
of
saint
mark
of
a
little
more
of
human
expression
and
throughout
the
course
of
its
later
development
always
subordinate
to
architectural
effect
the
work
of
the
venetian
school
never
escaped
from
the
influence
of
its
beginnings
unassisted
and
therefore
unperplexed
by
naturalism
religious
mysticism
philosophical
theories
it
had
no
giotto
no
angelico
no
botticelli
exempt
from
the
stress
of
thought
and
sentiment
which
taxed
so
severely
the
resources
of
the
generations
of
florentine
artists
those
earlier
venetian
painters
down
to
carpaccio
and
the
bellini
seem
never
for
a
moment
to
have
been
so
much
as
tempted
to
lose
sight
of
the
scope
of
their
art
in
its
strictness
or
to
forget
that
painting
must
be
before
all
things
decorative
a
thing
for
the
eye
a
space
of
colour
on
the
wall
only
more
dexterously
blent
than
the
marking
of
its
precious
stone
or
the
chance
interchange
of
sun
and
shade
upon
it
this
to
begin
and
end
with
whatever
higher
matter
of
thought
or
poetry
or
religious
reverie
might
play
its
part
therein
between
at
last
with
final
mastery
of
all
the
technical
secrets
of
his
art
and
with
somewhat
more
than
a
spark
of
the
divine
fire
to
his
share
comes
giorgione
he
is
the
inventor
of
genre
of
those
easily
movable
pictures
which
serve
neither
for
uses
of
devotion
nor
of
allegorical
or
historic
teaching
little
groups
of
real
men
and
women
amid
congruous
furniture
or
landscape
morsels
of
actual
life
conversation
or
music
or
play
but
refined
upon
or
idealised
till
they
come
to
seem
like
glimpses
of
life
from
afar
those
spaces
of
more
cunningly
blent
colour
obediently
filling
their
places
hitherto
in
a
mere
architectural
scheme
giorgione
detaches
from
the
wall
he
frames
them
by
the
hands
of
some
skilful
carver
so
that
people
may
move
them
readily
and
take
with
them
where
they
go
as
one
might
a
poem
in
manuscript
or
a
musical
instrument
to
be
used
at
will
as
a
means
of
stimulus
or
solace
coming
like
an
animated
presence
into
one
cabinet
to
enrich
the
air
as
with
some
choice
aroma
and
like
persons
live
with
us
for
a
day
or
a
lifetime
of
all
art
such
as
this
art
which
has
played
so
large
a
part
in
men
culture
since
that
time
giorgione
is
the
initiator
yet
in
him
too
that
old
venetian
clearness
or
justice
in
the
apprehension
of
the
essential
limitations
of
the
pictorial
art
is
still
undisturbed
while
he
interfuses
his
painted
work
with
a
sort
of
poetry
caught
directly
from
a
singularly
rich
and
sort
of
life
yet
in
his
selection
of
subject
or
phase
of
subject
in
the
subordination
of
mere
subject
to
pictorial
design
to
the
main
purpose
of
a
picture
he
is
typical
of
that
aspiration
of
all
the
arts
towards
music
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
towards
the
perfect
identification
of
matter
and
form
born
so
near
to
titian
though
a
little
before
him
that
these
two
companion
pupils
of
the
aged
giovanni
bellini
may
almost
be
called
contemporaries
giorgione
stands
to
titian
in
something
like
the
relationship
of
sordello
to
dante
in
browning
poem
titian
when
he
leaves
bellini
becomes
in
turn
the
pupil
of
giorgione
he
lives
in
constant
labour
more
than
sixty
years
after
giorgione
is
in
his
grave
and
with
such
fruit
that
hardly
one
of
the
greater
towns
of
europe
is
without
some
fragment
of
his
work
but
the
slightly
older
man
with
his
so
limited
actual
product
what
remains
to
us
of
it
seeming
when
narrowly
explained
to
reduce
itself
to
almost
one
picture
like
one
fragment
of
lovely
verse
yet
expresses
in
elementary
motive
and
principle
that
spirit
itself
the
final
acquisition
of
all
the
long
endeavours
of
venetian
art
which
titian
spreads
over
his
whole
life
activity
and
as
we
might
expect
something
fabulous
and
illusive
has
always
mingled
itself
in
the
brilliancy
of
giorgione
fame
the
exact
relationship
to
him
of
many
works
drawings
portraits
painted
idylls
often
fascinating
enough
which
in
various
collections
went
by
his
name
was
from
the
first
uncertain
still
six
or
eight
famous
pictures
at
dresden
florence
and
the
louvre
were
with
no
doubt
attributed
to
him
and
in
these
if
anywhere
something
of
the
splendour
of
the
old
venetian
humanity
seemed
to
have
been
preserved
but
of
those
six
or
eight
famous
pictures
it
is
now
known
that
only
one
is
certainly
from
giorgione
hand
the
accomplished
science
of
the
subject
has
come
at
last
and
as
in
other
instances
has
not
made
the
past
more
real
for
us
but
assured
us
only
that
we
possess
less
of
it
than
we
seemed
to
possess
much
of
the
work
on
which
giorgione
immediate
fame
depended
work
done
for
instantaneous
effect
in
all
probability
passed
away
almost
within
his
own
age
like
the
frescoes
on
the
façade
of
the
fondaco
dei
tedeschi
at
venice
some
crimson
traces
of
which
however
still
give
a
strange
additional
touch
of
splendour
to
the
scene
of
the
rialto
and
then
there
is
a
barrier
or
borderland
a
period
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
passing
through
which
the
tradition
miscarries
and
the
true
outlines
of
giorgione
work
and
person
are
obscured
it
became
fashionable
for
wealthy
lovers
of
art
with
no
critical
standard
of
authenticity
to
collect
works
of
giorgione
and
a
multitude
of
imitations
came
into
circulation
and
now
in
the
new
vasari
the
great
traditional
reputation
woven
with
so
profuse
demand
on
admiration
has
been
scrutinised
thread
by
thread
and
what
remains
of
the
most
vivid
and
stimulating
of
venetian
masters
a
live
flame
as
it
seemed
in
those
old
shadowy
times
has
been
reduced
almost
to
a
name
by
his
most
recent
critics
yet
enough
remains
to
explain
why
the
legend
grew
up
above
the
name
why
the
name
attached
itself
in
many
instances
to
the
bravest
work
of
other
men
the
concert
in
the
pitti
palace
in
which
a
monk
with
cowl
and
tonsure
touches
the
keys
of
a
harpsichord
while
a
clerk
placed
behind
him
grasps
the
handle
of
the
viol
and
a
third
with
cap
and
plume
seems
to
wait
upon
the
true
interval
for
beginning
to
sing
is
undoubtedly
giorgione
the
outline
of
the
lifted
finger
the
trace
of
the
plume
the
very
threads
of
the
fine
linen
which
fasten
themselves
on
the
memory
in
the
moment
before
they
are
lost
altogether
in
that
calm
unearthly
glow
the
skill
which
has
caught
the
waves
of
wandering
sound
and
fixed
them
for
ever
on
the
lips
and
hands
these
are
indeed
the
master
own
and
the
criticism
which
while
dismissing
so
much
hitherto
believed
to
be
giorgione
has
established
the
claims
of
this
one
picture
has
left
it
among
the
most
precious
things
in
the
world
of
art
it
is
noticeable
that
the
distinction
of
this
concert
its
sustained
evenness
of
perfection
alike
in
design
in
execution
and
in
choice
of
personal
type
becomes
for
the
new
vasari
the
standard
of
giorgione
genuine
work
finding
here
sufficient
to
explain
his
influence
and
the
true
seal
of
mastery
its
authors
assign
to
pellegrino
da
san
daniele
the
holy
family
in
the
louvre
in
consideration
of
certain
points
where
it
comes
short
of
this
standard
such
shortcoming
however
will
hardly
diminish
the
spectator
enjoyment
of
a
singular
charm
of
liquid
air
with
which
the
whole
picture
seems
instinct
filling
the
eyes
and
lips
the
very
garments
of
its
sacred
personages
with
some
searched
brightness
and
energy
of
which
fine
air
the
blue
peak
clearly
defined
in
the
distance
is
as
it
were
the
visible
pledge
similarly
another
favourite
picture
in
the
louvre
the
subject
of
a
delightful
sonnet
by
a
whose
own
painted
work
often
comes
to
mind
as
one
ponders
over
these
precious
things
the
fęte
champętre
is
assigned
to
an
imitator
of
sebastian
del
piombo
and
the
tempest
in
the
academy
at
venice
to
paris
bordone
or
perhaps
to
some
advanced
craftsman
of
the
sixteenth
century
from
the
gallery
at
dresden
the
knight
embracing
a
lady
where
the
knight
broken
gauntlets
seem
to
mark
some
pause
in
a
story
we
would
willingly
hear
the
rest
of
is
conceded
to
a
brescian
hand
and
jacob
meeting
rachel
to
a
pupil
of
palma
and
then
whatever
their
charm
we
are
called
on
to
give
up
the
ordeal
and
the
finding
of
moses
with
its
pools
of
water
perhaps
to
bellini
nor
has
the
criticism
which
thus
so
freely
diminishes
the
number
of
his
authentic
works
added
anything
important
to
the
known
outline
of
the
life
and
personality
of
the
man
only
it
has
fixed
one
or
two
dates
one
or
two
circumstances
a
little
more
exactly
giorgione
was
born
before
the
year
and
spent
his
childhood
at
castelfranco
where
the
last
crags
of
the
venetian
alps
break
down
romantically
with
something
of
parklike
grace
to
the
plain
a
natural
child
of
the
family
of
the
barbarelli
by
a
of
vedelago
he
finds
his
way
early
into
the
circle
of
notable
persons
people
of
courtesy
he
is
initiated
into
those
differences
of
personal
type
manner
and
even
of
dress
which
are
best
understood
there
that
distinction
of
the
concert
of
the
pitti
palace
not
far
from
his
home
lives
catherine
of
cornara
formerly
queen
of
cyprus
and
up
in
the
towers
which
still
remain
tuzio
costanzo
the
famous
condottiere
a
picturesque
remnant
of
medieval
manners
amid
a
civilisation
rapidly
changing
giorgione
paints
their
portraits
and
when
tuzio
son
matteo
dies
in
early
youth
adorns
in
his
memory
a
chapel
in
the
church
of
castelfranco
painting
on
this
occasion
perhaps
the
foremost
among
his
authentic
works
still
to
be
seen
there
with
the
figure
of
the
liberale
of
which
the
original
little
study
in
oil
with
the
delicately
gleaming
grey
armour
is
one
of
the
greater
treasures
of
the
national
gallery
in
that
figure
as
in
some
other
knightly
personages
attributed
to
him
people
have
supposed
the
likeness
of
the
painter
own
presumably
gracious
presence
thither
at
last
he
is
himself
brought
home
from
venice
early
dead
but
celebrated
it
happened
about
his
year
that
in
one
of
those
parties
at
which
he
entertained
his
friends
with
music
he
met
a
certain
lady
of
whom
he
became
greatly
enamoured
and
they
rejoiced
greatly
says
vasari
the
one
and
the
other
in
their
loves
and
two
quite
different
legends
concerning
it
agree
in
this
that
it
was
through
this
lady
he
came
by
his
death
ridolfi
relating
that
being
robbed
of
her
by
one
of
his
pupils
he
died
of
grief
at
the
double
treason
vasari
that
she
being
secretly
stricken
of
the
plague
and
he
making
his
visits
to
her
as
usual
giorgione
took
the
sickness
from
her
mortally
along
with
her
kisses
and
so
briefly
departed
but
although
the
number
of
giorgione
extant
works
has
been
thus
limited
by
recent
criticism
all
is
not
done
when
the
real
and
the
traditional
elements
in
what
concerns
him
have
been
discriminated
for
in
what
is
connected
with
a
great
name
much
that
is
not
real
is
often
very
stimulating
for
the
aesthetic
philosopher
therefore
over
and
above
the
real
giorgione
and
his
authentic
extant
works
there
remains
the
giorgionesque
also
an
influence
a
spirit
or
type
in
art
active
in
men
so
different
as
those
to
whom
many
of
his
supposed
works
are
really
assignable
a
veritable
school
in
fact
grew
together
out
of
all
those
fascinating
works
rightly
or
wrongly
attributed
to
him
out
of
many
copies
from
or
variations
on
him
by
unknown
or
uncertain
workmen
whose
drawings
and
designs
were
for
various
reasons
prized
as
his
out
of
the
immediate
impression
he
made
upon
his
contemporaries
and
with
which
he
continued
in
men
minds
out
of
many
traditions
of
subject
and
treatment
which
really
descend
from
him
to
our
own
time
and
by
retracing
which
we
fill
out
the
original
image
giorgione
thus
becomes
a
sort
of
impersonation
of
venice
itself
its
projected
reflex
or
ideal
all
that
was
intense
or
desirable
in
it
crystallising
about
the
memory
of
this
wonderful
young
man
and
now
finally
let
me
illustrate
some
of
the
characteristics
of
this
school
of
giorgione
as
we
may
call
it
which
for
most
of
us
notwithstanding
all
that
negative
criticism
of
the
new
vasari
will
still
identify
itself
with
those
famous
pictures
at
florence
at
dresden
and
paris
a
certain
artistic
ideal
is
there
defined
for
conception
of
a
peculiar
aim
and
procedure
in
art
which
we
may
understand
as
the
giorgionesque
wherever
we
find
it
whether
in
venetian
work
generally
or
in
work
of
our
own
time
of
this
the
concert
that
undoubted
work
of
giorgione
in
the
pitti
palace
is
the
typical
instance
and
a
pledge
authenticating
the
connexion
of
the
school
and
the
spirit
of
the
school
with
the
master
i
have
spoken
of
a
certain
interpenetration
of
the
matter
or
subject
of
a
work
of
art
with
the
form
of
it
a
condition
realised
absolutely
only
in
music
as
the
condition
to
which
every
form
of
art
is
perpetually
aspiring
in
the
art
of
painting
the
attainment
of
this
ideal
condition
this
perfect
interpenetration
of
the
subject
with
the
elements
of
colour
and
design
depends
of
course
in
great
measure
on
dexterous
choice
of
that
subject
or
phase
of
subject
and
such
choice
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
school
it
is
the
school
of
genre
and
employs
itself
mainly
with
painted
idylls
but
in
the
production
of
this
pictorial
poetry
exercises
a
wonderful
tact
in
the
selecting
of
such
matter
as
lends
itself
most
readily
and
entirely
to
pictorial
form
to
complete
expression
by
drawing
and
colour
for
although
its
productions
are
painted
poems
they
belong
to
a
sort
of
poetry
which
tells
itself
without
an
articulated
story
the
master
is
for
the
resolution
the
ease
and
quickness
with
which
he
reproduces
instantaneous
motion
the
of
armour
with
the
head
bent
back
so
stately
the
fainting
lady
the
embrace
rapid
as
the
kiss
caught
with
death
itself
from
dying
lips
some
momentary
conjunction
of
mirrors
and
polished
armour
and
still
water
by
which
all
the
sides
of
a
solid
image
are
exhibited
at
once
solving
that
casuistical
question
whether
painting
can
present
an
object
as
completely
as
sculpture
the
sudden
act
the
rapid
transition
of
thought
the
passing
expression
this
he
arrests
with
that
vivacity
which
vasari
has
attributed
to
him
il
fuoco
giorgionesco
as
he
terms
it
now
it
is
part
of
the
ideality
of
the
highest
sort
of
dramatic
poetry
that
it
presents
us
with
a
kind
of
profoundly
significant
and
animated
instants
a
mere
gesture
a
look
a
smile
perhaps
some
brief
and
wholly
concrete
moment
into
which
however
all
the
motives
all
the
interests
and
effects
of
a
long
history
have
condensed
themselves
and
which
seem
to
absorb
past
and
future
in
an
intense
consciousness
of
the
present
such
ideal
instants
the
school
of
giorgione
selects
with
its
admirable
tact
from
that
feverish
tumultuously
coloured
world
of
the
old
citizens
of
venice
exquisite
pauses
in
time
in
which
arrested
thus
we
seem
to
be
spectators
of
all
the
fulness
of
existence
and
which
are
like
some
consummate
extract
or
quintessence
of
life
it
is
to
the
law
or
condition
of
music
as
i
said
that
all
art
like
this
is
really
aspiring
and
in
the
school
of
giorgione
the
perfect
moments
of
music
itself
the
making
or
hearing
of
music
song
or
its
accompaniment
are
themselves
prominent
as
subjects
on
that
background
of
the
silence
of
venice
so
impressive
to
the
modern
visitor
the
world
of
italian
music
was
then
forming
in
choice
of
subject
as
in
all
besides
the
concert
of
the
pitti
palace
is
typical
of
everything
that
giorgione
himself
an
admirable
musician
touched
with
his
influence
in
sketch
or
finished
picture
in
various
collections
we
may
follow
it
through
many
intricate
variations
men
fainting
at
music
music
at
the
while
people
fish
or
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
pitcher
in
the
well
or
heard
across
running
water
or
among
the
flocks
the
tuning
of
instruments
people
with
intent
faces
as
if
listening
like
those
described
by
plato
in
an
ingenious
passage
of
the
republic
to
detect
the
smallest
interval
of
musical
sound
the
smallest
undulation
in
the
air
or
feeling
for
music
in
thought
on
a
stringless
instrument
ear
and
finger
refining
themselves
infinitely
in
the
appetite
for
sweet
sound
a
momentary
touch
of
an
instrument
in
the
twilight
as
one
passes
through
some
unfamiliar
room
in
a
chance
company
in
these
then
the
favourite
incidents
of
giorgione
school
music
or
the
musical
intervals
in
our
existence
life
itself
is
conceived
as
a
sort
of
listening
listening
to
music
to
the
reading
of
bandello
novels
to
the
sound
of
water
to
time
as
it
flies
often
such
moments
are
really
our
moments
of
play
and
we
are
surprised
at
the
unexpected
blessedness
of
what
may
seem
our
least
important
part
of
time
not
merely
because
play
is
in
many
instances
that
to
which
people
really
apply
their
own
best
powers
but
also
because
at
such
times
the
stress
of
our
servile
everyday
attentiveness
being
relaxed
the
happier
powers
in
things
without
are
permitted
free
passage
and
have
their
way
with
us
and
so
from
music
the
school
of
giorgione
passes
often
to
the
play
which
is
like
music
to
those
masques
in
which
men
avowedly
do
but
play
at
real
life
like
children
dressing
up
disguised
in
the
strange
old
italian
dresses
or
fantastic
with
embroidery
and
furs
of
which
the
master
was
so
curious
a
designer
and
which
above
all
the
spotless
white
linen
at
wrist
and
throat
he
painted
so
dexterously
but
when
people
are
happy
in
this
thirsty
land
water
will
not
be
far
off
and
in
the
school
of
giorgione
the
presence
of
water
the
well
or
pool
the
drawing
or
pouring
of
water
as
the
woman
pours
it
from
a
pitcher
with
her
jewelled
hand
in
the
fęte
champętre
listening
perhaps
to
the
cool
sound
as
it
falls
blent
with
the
music
of
the
pipes
is
as
characteristic
and
almost
as
suggestive
as
that
of
music
itself
and
the
landscape
feels
and
is
glad
of
it
also
a
landscape
full
of
clearness
of
the
effects
of
water
of
fresh
rain
newly
passed
through
the
air
and
collected
into
the
grassy
channels
the
air
moreover
in
the
school
of
giorgione
seems
as
vivid
as
the
people
who
breathe
it
and
literally
empyrean
all
impurities
being
burnt
out
of
it
and
no
taint
no
floating
particle
of
anything
but
its
own
proper
elements
allowed
to
subsist
within
it
its
scenery
is
such
as
in
england
we
call
park
scenery
with
some
elusive
refinement
felt
about
the
rustic
buildings
the
choice
grass
the
grouped
trees
the
undulations
deftly
economised
for
graceful
effect
only
in
italy
all
natural
things
are
as
it
were
woven
through
and
through
with
gold
thread
even
the
cypress
revealing
it
among
the
folds
of
its
blackness
and
it
is
with
gold
dust
or
gold
thread
that
these
venetian
painters
seem
to
work
spinning
its
fine
filaments
through
the
solemn
human
flesh
away
into
the
white
plastered
walls
of
the
thatched
huts
the
harsher
details
of
the
mountains
recede
to
a
harmonious
distance
the
one
peak
of
rich
blue
above
the
horizon
remaining
but
as
the
sensible
warrant
of
that
due
coolness
which
is
all
we
need
ask
here
of
the
alps
with
their
dark
rains
and
streams
yet
what
real
airy
space
as
the
eye
passes
from
level
to
level
through
the
drawn
valley
in
which
jacob
embraces
rachel
among
the
flocks
nowhere
is
there
a
truer
instance
of
that
balance
that
modulated
unison
of
landscape
and
persons
of
the
human
image
and
its
accessories
already
noticed
as
characteristic
of
the
venetian
school
so
that
in
it
neither
personage
nor
scenery
is
ever
a
mere
pretext
for
the
other
something
like
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
vraie
vérité
about
giorgione
if
i
may
adopt
a
serviceable
expression
by
which
the
french
recognise
those
more
liberal
and
durable
impressions
which
in
respect
of
any
really
considerable
person
or
subject
anything
that
has
at
all
intricately
occupied
men
attention
lie
beyond
and
must
supplement
the
narrower
range
of
the
strictly
ascertained
facts
about
it
in
this
giorgione
is
but
an
illustration
of
a
valuable
general
caution
we
may
abide
by
in
all
criticism
as
regards
giorgione
himself
we
have
indeed
to
take
note
of
all
those
negations
and
exceptions
by
which
at
first
sight
a
new
vasari
seems
merely
to
have
confused
our
apprehension
of
a
delightful
object
to
have
explained
away
in
our
inheritance
from
past
time
what
seemed
of
high
value
there
yet
it
is
not
with
a
full
understanding
even
of
those
exceptions
that
one
can
leave
off
just
at
this
point
properly
qualified
such
exceptions
are
but
a
salt
of
genuineness
in
our
knowledge
and
beyond
all
those
strictly
ascertained
facts
we
must
take
note
of
that
indirect
influence
by
which
one
like
giorgione
for
instance
enlarges
his
permanent
efficacy
and
really
makes
himself
felt
in
our
culture
in
a
just
impression
of
that
is
the
essential
truth
the
vraie
vérité
concerning
him
notes
and
cavalcaselle
history
of
painting
in
north
italy
gabriel
rossetti
joachim
du
bellay
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
was
everywhere
and
people
had
begun
to
look
back
with
distaste
on
the
works
of
the
middle
age
the
old
gothic
manner
had
still
one
chance
more
in
borrowing
something
from
the
rival
which
was
about
to
supplant
it
in
this
way
there
was
produced
chiefly
in
france
a
new
and
peculiar
phase
of
taste
with
qualities
and
a
charm
of
its
own
blending
the
somewhat
attenuated
grace
of
italian
ornament
with
the
general
outlines
of
northern
design
it
created
the
château
de
gaillon
as
you
may
still
see
it
in
the
delicate
engravings
of
isräel
silvestre
a
gothic
donjon
veiled
faintly
by
a
surface
of
dainty
italian
traceries
chenonceaux
blois
chambord
and
the
church
of
brou
in
painting
there
came
from
italy
workmen
like
maître
roux
and
the
masters
of
the
school
of
fontainebleau
to
have
their
later
italian
voluptuousness
attempered
by
the
naďve
and
silvery
qualities
of
the
native
style
and
it
was
characteristic
of
these
painters
that
they
were
most
successful
in
painting
on
glass
an
art
so
essentially
medieval
taking
it
up
where
the
middle
age
had
left
it
they
found
their
whole
work
among
the
last
subtleties
of
colour
and
line
and
keeping
within
the
true
limits
of
their
material
they
got
quite
a
new
order
of
effects
from
it
and
felt
their
way
to
refinements
on
colour
never
dreamed
of
by
those
older
workmen
the
of
chartres
or
le
mans
what
is
called
the
renaissance
in
france
is
thus
not
so
much
the
introduction
of
a
wholly
new
taste
from
italy
but
rather
the
finest
and
subtlest
phase
of
the
middle
age
itself
its
last
fleeting
splendour
and
temperate
saint
martin
summer
in
poetry
the
gothic
spirit
in
france
had
produced
a
thousand
songs
so
in
the
renaissance
french
poetry
too
did
but
borrow
something
to
blend
with
a
native
growth
and
the
poems
of
ronsard
with
their
ingenuity
their
delicately
figured
surfaces
their
slightness
their
fanciful
combinations
of
rhyme
are
the
correlative
of
the
traceries
of
the
house
of
jacques
coeur
at
bourges
or
the
maison
de
justice
at
rouen
there
was
indeed
something
in
the
native
french
taste
naturally
akin
to
that
italian
finesse
the
characteristic
of
french
work
had
always
been
a
certain
nicety
a
remarkable
daintiness
of
hand
une
netteté
remarquable
in
the
paintings
of
françois
clouet
for
example
or
rather
of
the
clouets
for
there
was
a
whole
family
of
them
painters
remarkable
for
their
resistance
to
italian
influences
there
is
a
silveriness
of
colour
and
a
clearness
of
expression
which
distinguish
them
very
definitely
from
their
flemish
neighbours
hemling
or
the
van
eycks
and
this
nicety
is
not
less
characteristic
of
old
french
poetry
a
light
aërial
delicacy
a
simple
elegance
une
netteté
remarquable
these
are
essential
characteristics
alike
of
poetry
and
of
the
hours
of
anne
of
brittany
they
are
characteristic
too
of
a
hundred
french
gothic
carvings
and
traceries
alike
in
the
old
gothic
cathedrals
and
in
their
counterpart
the
old
gothic
chansons
de
geste
the
rough
and
ponderous
mass
becomes
as
if
by
passing
for
a
moment
into
happier
conditions
or
through
a
more
gracious
stratum
of
air
graceful
and
refined
like
the
carved
ferneries
on
the
granite
church
at
folgoat
or
the
lines
which
describe
the
fair
priestly
hands
of
archbishop
turpin
in
the
song
of
roland
although
below
both
alike
there
is
a
fund
of
mere
gothic
strength
or
heaviness
now
villon
songs
and
clouet
painting
are
like
these
it
is
the
higher
touch
making
itself
felt
here
and
there
betraying
itself
like
nobler
blood
in
a
lower
stock
by
a
fine
line
or
gesture
or
expression
the
turn
of
a
wrist
the
tapering
of
a
finger
in
ronsard
time
that
rougher
element
seemed
likely
to
predominate
no
one
can
turn
over
the
pages
of
rabelais
without
feeling
how
much
need
there
was
of
softening
of
castigation
to
effect
this
softening
is
the
object
of
the
revolution
in
poetry
which
is
connected
with
ronsard
name
casting
about
for
the
means
of
thus
refining
upon
and
saving
the
character
of
french
literature
he
accepted
that
influx
of
renaissance
taste
which
leaving
the
buildings
the
language
the
art
the
poetry
of
france
at
bottom
what
they
were
old
french
gothic
still
gilds
their
surfaces
with
a
strange
delightful
foreign
aspect
passing
over
all
that
northern
land
in
itself
neither
deeper
nor
more
permanent
than
a
chance
effect
of
light
he
reinforces
he
doubles
the
french
daintiness
by
italian
finesse
thereupon
nearly
all
the
force
and
all
the
seriousness
of
french
work
disappear
only
the
elegance
the
aërial
touch
the
perfect
manner
remain
but
this
elegance
this
manner
this
daintiness
of
execution
are
consummate
and
have
an
unmistakable
aesthetic
value
so
the
old
french
chanson
which
like
the
old
northern
gothic
ornament
though
it
sometimes
refined
itself
into
a
sort
of
weird
elegance
was
often
in
its
essence
something
rude
and
formless
became
in
the
hands
of
ronsard
a
pindaric
ode
he
gave
it
structure
a
sustained
system
strophe
and
antistrophe
and
taught
it
a
changefulness
and
variety
of
metre
which
keep
the
curiosity
always
excited
so
that
the
very
aspect
of
it
as
it
lies
written
on
the
page
carries
the
eye
lightly
onwards
and
of
which
this
is
a
good
instance

that
is
not
by
ronsard
but
by
remy
belleau
for
ronsard
soon
came
to
have
a
school
six
other
poets
threw
in
their
lot
with
him
in
his
literary
revolution
this
remy
belleau
antoine
de
baif
pontus
de
tyard
étienne
jodelle
jean
daurat
and
lastly
joachim
du
bellay
and
with
that
strange
love
of
emblems
which
is
characteristic
of
the
time
which
covered
all
the
works
of
francis
the
first
with
the
salamander
and
all
the
works
of
henry
the
second
with
the
double
crescent
and
all
the
works
of
anne
of
brittany
with
the
knotted
cord
they
called
themselves
the
pleiad
seven
in
all
although
as
happens
with
the
celestial
pleiad
if
you
scrutinise
this
constellation
of
poets
more
carefully
you
may
find
there
a
great
number
of
minor
stars
the
first
note
of
this
literary
revolution
was
struck
by
joachim
du
bellay
in
a
little
tract
written
at
the
early
age
of
which
coming
to
us
through
three
centuries
seems
of
yesterday
so
full
is
it
of
those
delicate
critical
distinctions
which
are
sometimes
supposed
peculiar
to
modern
writers
the
piece
has
for
its
title
la
deffense
et
illustration
de
la
langue
françoyse
and
its
problem
is
how
to
illustrate
or
ennoble
the
french
language
to
give
it
lustre
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
varied
critical
and
creative
movement
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
as
the
renaissance
and
because
we
have
a
single
name
for
it
we
may
sometimes
fancy
that
there
was
more
unity
in
the
thing
itself
than
there
really
was
even
the
reformation
that
other
great
movement
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
had
far
less
unity
far
less
of
combined
action
than
is
at
first
sight
supposed
and
the
renaissance
was
infinitely
less
united
less
conscious
of
combined
action
than
the
reformation
but
if
anywhere
the
renaissance
became
conscious
as
a
german
philosopher
might
say
if
ever
it
was
understood
as
a
systematic
movement
by
those
who
took
part
in
it
it
is
in
this
little
book
of
joachim
du
bellay
which
it
is
impossible
to
read
without
feeling
the
excitement
the
animation
of
change
of
discovery
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
says
and
an
inversion
of
what
is
true
of
other
languages
that
in
french
prose
has
always
had
the
precedence
over
poetry
du
bellay
prose
is
perfectly
transparent
flexible
and
chaste
in
many
ways
it
is
a
more
characteristic
example
of
the
culture
of
the
pleiad
than
any
of
its
verse
and
those
who
love
the
whole
movement
of
which
the
pleiad
is
a
part
for
a
weird
foreign
grace
in
it
and
may
be
looking
about
for
a
true
specimen
of
it
can
not
have
a
better
than
joachim
du
bellay
and
this
little
treatise
of
his
du
bellay
object
is
to
adjust
the
existing
french
culture
to
the
rediscovered
classical
culture
and
in
discussing
this
problem
and
developing
the
theories
of
the
pleiad
he
has
lighted
upon
many
principles
of
permanent
truth
and
applicability
there
were
some
who
despaired
of
the
french
language
altogether
who
thought
it
naturally
incapable
of
the
fulness
and
elegance
of
greek
and
latin
cette
élégance
et
copie
qui
est
en
la
langue
greque
et
romaine
that
science
could
be
adequately
discussed
and
poetry
nobly
written
only
in
the
dead
languages
those
who
speak
thus
says
du
bellay
make
me
think
of
the
relics
which
one
may
only
see
through
a
little
pane
of
glass
and
must
not
touch
with
one
hands
that
is
what
these
people
do
with
all
branches
of
culture
which
they
keep
shut
up
in
greek
and
latin
books
not
permitting
one
to
see
them
otherwise
or
transport
them
out
of
dead
words
into
those
which
are
alive
and
wing
their
way
daily
through
the
mouths
of
men
languages
he
says
again
are
not
born
like
plants
and
trees
some
naturally
feeble
and
sickly
others
healthy
and
strong
and
apter
to
bear
the
weight
of
men
conceptions
but
all
their
virtue
is
generated
in
the
world
of
choice
and
men
freewill
concerning
them
therefore
i
can
not
blame
too
strongly
the
rashness
of
some
of
our
countrymen
who
being
anything
rather
than
greeks
or
latins
depreciate
and
reject
with
more
than
stoical
disdain
everything
written
in
french
nor
can
i
express
my
surprise
at
the
odd
opinion
of
some
learned
men
who
think
that
our
vulgar
tongue
is
wholly
incapable
of
erudition
and
good
literature
it
was
an
age
of
translations
du
bellay
himself
translated
two
books
of
the
aeneid
and
other
poetry
old
and
new
and
there
were
some
who
thought
that
the
translation
of
the
classical
literature
was
the
true
means
of
ennobling
the
french
language
strangers
are
ever
favourites
with
us
nous
favorisons
toujours
les
étrangers
du
bellay
moderates
their
expectations
i
do
not
believe
that
one
can
learn
the
right
use
of
them
he
is
speaking
of
figures
and
ornament
in
language
from
translations
because
it
is
impossible
to
reproduce
them
with
the
same
grace
with
which
the
original
author
used
them
for
each
language
has
i
know
not
what
peculiarity
of
its
own
and
if
you
force
yourself
to
express
the
naturalness
le
naďf
of
this
in
another
language
observing
the
law
of
translation
not
to
expatiate
beyond
the
limits
of
the
author
himself
your
words
will
be
constrained
cold
and
ungraceful
then
he
fixes
the
test
of
all
good
translation
to
prove
this
read
me
demosthenes
and
homer
in
latin
cicero
and
virgil
in
french
and
see
whether
they
produce
in
you
the
same
affections
which
you
experience
in
reading
those
authors
in
the
original
in
this
effort
to
ennoble
the
french
language
to
give
it
grace
number
perfection
and
as
painters
do
to
their
pictures
that
last
so
desirable
touch
cette
derničre
main
que
nous
du
bellay
is
really
pleading
for
is
his
the
language
that
is
in
which
one
will
have
the
utmost
degree
of
what
is
moving
and
passionate
he
recognised
of
what
force
the
music
and
dignity
of
languages
are
how
they
enter
into
the
inmost
part
of
things
and
in
pleading
for
the
cultivation
of
the
french
language
he
is
pleading
for
no
merely
scholastic
interest
but
for
freedom
impulse
reality
not
in
literature
only
but
in
daily
communion
of
speech
after
all
it
was
impossible
to
have
this
impulse
in
greek
and
latin
dead
languages
shut
up
in
books
as
in
reliquaries
péris
et
mises
en
reliquaires
de
livres
by
aid
of
this
starveling
stock
pauvre
plante
et
vergette
of
the
french
language
he
must
speak
delicately
movingly
if
he
is
ever
to
speak
so
at
all
that
or
none
must
be
for
him
the
medium
of
what
he
calls
in
one
of
his
great
phrases
le
discours
fatal
des
choses
mondaines
that
discourse
about
affairs
which
decides
fates
and
it
is
his
patriotism
not
to
despair
of
it
he
sees
it
already
perfect
in
all
elegance
and
beauty
of
words
parfait
en
toute
élégance
et

du
bellay
was
born
in
the
disastrous
year
the
year
of
the
battle
of
pavia
and
the
captivity
of
francis
the
first
his
parents
died
early
and
to
him
as
the
younger
son
his
mother
little
estate
ce
petit
liré
the
beloved
place
of
his
birth
descended
he
was
brought
up
by
a
brother
only
a
little
older
than
himself
and
left
to
themselves
the
two
boys
passed
their
lives
in
of
military
glory
their
education
was
neglected
the
time
of
my
youth
says
du
bellay
was
lost
like
the
flower
which
no
shower
waters
and
no
hand
cultivates
he
was
just
twenty
years
old
when
the
elder
brother
died
leaving
joachim
to
be
the
guardian
of
his
child
it
was
with
regret
with
a
shrinking
sense
of
incapacity
that
he
took
upon
him
the
burden
of
this
responsibility
hitherto
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
profession
of
a
soldier
hereditary
in
his
family
but
at
this
time
a
sickness
attacked
him
which
brought
him
cruel
sufferings
and
seemed
likely
to
be
mortal
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
he
read
the
greek
and
latin
poets
these
studies
came
too
late
to
make
him
what
he
so
much
desired
to
be
a
trifler
in
greek
and
latin
verse
like
so
many
others
of
his
time
now
forgotten
instead
they
made
him
a
lover
of
his
own
homely
native
tongue
that
poor
starveling
stock
of
the
french
language
it
was
through
this
fortunate
in
his
education
that
he
became
national
and
modern
and
he
learned
afterwards
to
look
back
on
that
wild
garden
of
his
youth
with
only
a
half
regret
a
certain
cardinal
du
bellay
was
the
successful
member
of
the
family
a
man
often
employed
in
high
official
business
to
him
the
thoughts
of
joachim
turned
when
it
became
necessary
to
choose
a
profession
and
in
he
accompanied
the
cardinal
to
rome
he
remained
there
nearly
five
years
burdened
with
the
weight
of
affairs
and
languishing
with
yet
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
his
genius
yielded
its
best
fruits
from
rome
so
full
of
pleasurable
sensation
for
men
of
an
imaginative
temperament
such
as
his
with
all
the
curiosities
of
the
renaissance
still
fresh
in
it
his
thoughts
went
back
painfully
longingly
to
the
country
of
the
loire
with
its
wide
expanse
of
waving
corn
its
homely
pointed
roofs
of
grey
slate
and
its
off
scent
of
the
sea
he
reached
home
at
last
but
only
to
die
there
quite
suddenly
one
wintry
day
at
the
early
age
of
five
much
of
du
bellay
poetry
illustrates
rather
the
age
and
school
to
which
he
belonged
than
his
own
temper
and
genius
as
with
the
writings
of
ronsard
and
the
other
poets
of
the
pleiad
its
interest
depends
not
so
much
on
the
impress
of
individual
genius
upon
it
as
on
the
circumstance
that
it
was
once
poetry
ŕ
la
mode
that
it
is
part
of
the
manner
of
a
time
a
time
which
made
much
of
manner
and
carried
it
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
it
is
one
of
the
decorations
of
an
age
which
threw
a
large
part
of
its
energy
into
the
work
of
decoration
we
feel
a
pensive
pleasure
in
gazing
on
these
faded
adornments
and
observing
how
a
group
of
actual
men
and
women
pleased
themselves
long
ago
poems
are
a
kind
of
epitome
of
his
age
of
one
side
of
that
age
it
is
true
of
the
strenuous
the
progressive
the
serious
movement
which
was
then
going
on
there
is
little
but
of
the
catholic
side
the
losing
side
the
forlorn
hope
hardly
a
figure
is
absent
the
queen
of
scots
at
whose
desire
ronsard
published
his
odes
reading
him
in
her
northern
prison
felt
that
he
was
bringing
back
to
her
the
true
flavour
of
her
early
days
in
the
court
of
catherine
at
the
louvre
with
its
exotic
italian
gaieties
those
who
disliked
that
poetry
disliked
it
because
they
found
that
age
itself
distasteful
the
poetry
of
malherbe
came
with
its
sustained
style
and
weighty
sentiment
but
with
nothing
that
set
people
singing
and
the
lovers
of
such
poetry
saw
in
the
poetry
of
the
pleiad
only
the
latest
trumpery
of
the
middle
age
but
the
time
arrived
when
the
school
of
malherbe
also
had
had
its
day
and
the
romanticists
who
in
their
eagerness
for
excitement
for
strange
music
and
imagery
went
back
to
the
works
of
the
middle
age
accepted
the
pleiad
too
with
the
rest
and
in
that
new
middle
age
which
their
genius
has
evoked
the
poetry
of
the
pleiad
has
found
its
place
at
first
with
malherbe
you
may
think
it
like
the
architecture
the
whole
mode
of
life
the
very
dresses
of
that
time
fantastic
faded
rococo
but
if
you
look
long
enough
to
understand
it
to
conceive
its
sentiment
you
will
find
that
those
wanton
lines
have
a
spirit
guiding
their
caprices
for
there
is
style
there
one
temper
has
shaped
the
whole
and
everything
that
has
style
that
has
been
done
as
no
other
man
or
age
could
have
done
it
as
it
could
never
for
all
our
trying
be
done
again
has
its
true
value
and
interest
let
us
dwell
upon
it
for
a
moment
and
try
to
gather
from
it
that
special
flower
ce
fleur
particulier
which
ronsard
himself
tells
us
every
garden
has
it
is
poetry
not
for
the
people
but
for
a
confined
circle
for
courtiers
great
lords
and
erudite
persons
people
who
desire
to
be
humoured
to
gratify
a
certain
refined
voluptuousness
they
have
in
them
ronsard
loves
or
dreams
that
he
loves
a
rare
and
peculiar
type
of
beauty
la
petite
pucelle
angevine
with
golden
hair
and
dark
eyes
but
he
has
the
ambition
not
only
of
being
a
courtier
and
a
lover
but
a
great
scholar
also
he
is
anxious
about
orthography
about
the
letter
č
grecque
the
true
spelling
of
latin
names
in
french
writing
and
the
restoration
of
the
letter
i
to
its
primitive
liberty
del
i
voyelle
en
sa
premičre
liberté
his
poetry
is
full
of
quaint
remote
learning
he
is
just
a
little
pedantic
true
always
to
his
own
express
judgment
that
to
be
natural
is
not
enough
for
one
who
in
poetry
desires
to
produce
work
worthy
of
immortality
and
therewithal
a
certain
number
of
greek
words
which
charmed
ronsard
and
his
circle
by
their
gaiety
and
daintiness
and
a
certain
air
of
foreign
elegance
about
them
crept
into
the
french
language
as
there
were
other
strange
words
which
the
poets
of
the
pleiad
forged
for
themselves
and
which
had
only
an
ephemeral
existence
with
this
was
united
the
desire
to
taste
a
more
exquisite
and
various
music
than
that
of
the
older
french
verse
or
of
the
classical
poets
the
music
of
the
measured
scanned
verse
of
latin
and
greek
poetry
is
one
thing
the
music
of
the
rhymed
unscanned
verse
of
villon
and
the
old
french
poets
la
poésie
chantée
is
another
to
combine
these
two
kinds
of
music
in
a
new
school
of
french
poetry
to
make
verse
which
should
scan
and
rhyme
as
well
to
search
out
and
harmonise
the
measure
of
every
syllable
and
unite
it
to
the
swift
flitting
motion
of
rhyme
to
penetrate
their
poetry
with
a
double
music
this
was
the
ambition
of
the
pleiad
they
are
insatiable
of
music
they
can
not
have
enough
of
it
they
desire
a
music
of
greater
compass
perhaps
than
words
can
possibly
yield
to
drain
out
the
last
drops
of
sweetness
which
a
certain
note
or
accent
contains
it
was
goudimel
the
serious
and
protestant
goudimel
who
set
ronsard
songs
to
music
but
except
in
this
eagerness
for
music
the
poets
of
the
pleiad
seem
never
quite
in
earnest
the
old
greek
and
roman
mythology
which
the
great
italians
had
found
a
motive
so
weighty
and
severe
becomes
with
them
a
mere
toy
that
lord
of
terrible
aspect
amor
has
become
love
the
boy
or
the
babe
they
are
full
of
fine
railleries
they
delight
in
diminutives
ondelette
fontelette
doucelette
cassandrette
their
loves
are
only
half
real
a
vain
effort
to
prolong
the
imaginative
loves
of
the
middle
age
beyond
their
natural
lifetime
they
write
for
hire
like
that
party
of
people
who
tell
the
tales
in
boccaccio
decameron
they
form
a
circle
which
in
an
age
of
great
troubles
losses
anxieties
can
amuse
itself
with
art
poetry
intrigue
but
they
amuse
themselves
with
wonderful
elegance
and
sometimes
their
gaiety
becomes
satiric
for
as
they
play
real
passions
insinuate
themselves
and
at
least
the
reality
of
death
their
dejection
at
the
thought
of
leaving
this
fair
abode
of
our
common
daylight
le
beau
sejour
du
commun
jour
is
expressed
by
them
with
almost
wearisome
reiteration
but
with
this
sentiment
too
they
are
able
to
trifle
the
imagery
of
death
serves
for
delicate
ornament
and
they
weave
into
the
airy
nothingness
of
their
verses
their
trite
reflections
on
the
vanity
of
life
just
so
the
grotesque
details
of
the
nest
themselves
together
with
birds
and
flowers
and
the
fancies
of
the
pagan
mythology
in
the
traceries
of
the
architecture
of
that
time
which
wantons
in
its
graceful
arabesques
with
the
images
of
old
age
and
death
ronsard
became
deaf
at
sixteen
and
it
was
this
circumstance
which
finally
determined
him
to
be
a
man
of
letters
instead
of
a
diplomatist
significantly
one
might
fancy
of
a
certain
premature
agedness
and
of
the
tranquil
temperate
sweetness
appropriate
to
that
in
the
school
of
poetry
which
he
founded
its
charm
is
that
of
a
thing
not
vigorous
or
original
but
full
of
the
grace
which
comes
of
long
study
and
reiterated
refinements
and
many
steps
repeated
and
many
angles
worn
down
with
an
exquisite
faintness
une
fadeur
exquise
a
certain
tenuity
and
caducity
as
for
those
who
can
bear
nothing
vehement
or
strong
for
princes
weary
of
love
like
francis
the
first
or
of
pleasure
like
henry
the
third
or
of
action
like
henry
the
fourth
its
merits
are
those
of
the
old
grace
and
finish
perfect
in
minute
detail
for
these
people
are
a
little
jaded
and
have
a
constant
desire
for
a
subdued
and
delicate
excitement
to
warm
their
creeping
fancy
a
little
they
love
a
constant
change
of
rhyme
in
poetry
and
in
their
houses
that
strange
fantastic
interweaving
of
thin
lines
which
are
a
kind
of
rhetoric
in
architecture
but
the
poetry
of
the
pleiad
is
true
not
only
to
the
physiognomy
of
its
age
but
also
to
its
country
ce
pays
du
vendomois
the
names
and
scenery
of
which
so
often
recur
in
it
great
loire
with
its
long
spaces
of
white
sand
the
little
river
loir
the
heathy
upland
country
with
its
scattered
pools
of
water
and
waste
and
retired
manors
with
their
crazy
old
feudal
defences
half
fallen
into
decay
la
beauce
where
the
vast
rolling
fields
seem
to
anticipate
the
great
western
sea
itself
it
is
full
of
the
traits
of
that
country
we
see
du
bellay
and
ronsard
gardening
or
hunting
with
their
dogs
or
watch
the
pastimes
of
a
rainy
day
and
with
all
this
is
connected
a
domesticity
a
homeliness
and
simple
goodness
by
which
the
northern
country
gains
upon
the
south
they
have
the
love
of
the
aged
for
warmth
and
understand
the
poetry
of
winter
for
they
are
not
far
from
the
atlantic
and
the
west
wind
which
comes
up
from
it
turning
the
poplars
white
spares
not
this
new
italy
in
france
so
the
fireside
often
appears
with
the
pleasures
of
the
frosty

is
thus
a
characteristic
specimen
of
the
poetical
taste
of
that
age
is
indeed
du

chief
interest
but
if
his
work
is
to
have
the
highest
sort
of
interest
if
it
is
to
do
something
more
than
satisfy
curiosity
if
it
is
to
have
an
aesthetic
as
distinct
from
an
historical
value
it
is
not
enough
for
a
poet
to
have
been
the
true
child
of
his
age
to
have
conformed
to
its
aesthetic
conditions
and
by
so
conforming
to
have
charmed
and
stimulated
that
age
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
perceptible
in
his
work
something
individual
inventive
unique
the
impress
there
of
the
writer
own
temper
and
personality
this
impress
thought
he
found
in
the
antiquités
de
rome
and
the
regrets
which
he
ranks
as
what
has
been
called
poésie
intime
that
intensely
modern
sort
of
poetry
in
which
the
writer
has
for
his
aim
the
portraiture
of
his
own
most
intimate
moods
and
to
take
the
reader
into
his
confidence
that
age
had
other
instances
of
this
intimacy
of
sentiment
montaigne
essays
are
full
of
it
the
carvings
of
the
church
of
brou
are
full
of
it
has
perhaps
exaggerated
the
influence
of
this
quality
in
du
bellay
regrets
but
the
very
name
of
the
book
has
a
touch
of
rousseau
about
it
and
reminds
one
of
a
whole
generation
of
poets
in
modern
times
it
was
in
the
atmosphere
of
rome
to
him
so
strange
and
mournful
that
these
pale
flowers
grew
up
for
that
journey
to
italy
which
he
deplored
as
the
greatest
misfortune
of
his
life
put
him
in
full
possession
of
his
talent
and
brought
out
all
its
originality
and
in
effect
you
do
find
intimacy
intimité
here
the
trouble
of
his
life
is
analysed
and
the
sentiment
of
it
conveyed
directly
to
our
minds
not
a
great
sorrow
or
passion
but
only
the
sense
of
loss
in
passing
days
the
ennui
of
a
dreamer
who
must
plunge
into
the
world
affairs
the
opposition
between
actual
life
and
the
ideal
a
longing
for
rest
nostalgia
that
childish
but
so
suggestive
sorrow
as
significant
of
the
final
regret
of
all
human
creatures
for
the
familiar
earth
and
limited
sky
the
feeling
for
landscape
is
often
described
as
a
modern
one
still
more
so
is
that
for
antiquity
the
sentiment
of
ruins
du
bellay
has
this
sentiment
the
duration
of
the
hard
sharp
outlines
of
things
is
a
grief
to
him
and
passing
his
wearisome
days
among
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
he
is
consoled
by
the
thought
that
all
must
one
day
end
by
the
sentiment
of
the
grandeur
of
nothingness
la
grandeur
du
rien
with
a
strange
touch
of
mysticism
he
thinks
that
the
great
whole
le
grand
tout
into
which
all
other
things
pass
and
lose
themselves
ought
itself
sometimes
to
perish
and
pass
away
nothing
less
can
relieve
his
weariness
from
the
stately
aspects
of
rome
his
thoughts
went
back
continually
to
france
to
the
smoking
chimneys
of
his
little
village
the
longer
twilight
of
the
north
the
soft
climate
of
anjou
la
douceur
angevine
yet
not
so
much
to
the
real
france
we
may
be
sure
with
its
dark
streets
and
roofs
of
slate
as
to
that
other
country
with
slenderer
towers
and
more
winding
rivers
and
trees
like
flowers
and
with
softer
sunshine
on
more
fields
and
ways
which
the
fancy
of
the
exile
and
the
pilgrim
and
of
the
schoolboy
far
from
home
and
of
those
kept
at
home
unwillingly
everywhere
builds
up
before
or
behind
them
he
came
home
at
last
through
the
grisons
by
slow
journeys
and
there
in
the
cooler
air
of
his
own
country
under
its
skies
of
milkier
blue
the
sweetest
flower
of
his
genius
sprang
up
there
have
been
poets
whose
whole
fame
has
rested
on
one
poem
as
gray
on
the
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
or
ronsard
as
many
critics
have
thought
on
the
eighteen
lines
of
one
famous
ode
du
bellay
has
almost
been
the
poet
of
one
poem
and
this
one
poem
of
his
is
an
italian
product
transplanted
into
that
green
country
of
anjou
out
of
the
latin
verses
of
andrea
navagero
into
french
but
it
is
a
composition
in
which
the
matter
is
almost
nothing
and
the
form
almost
everything
and
the
form
of
the
poem
as
it
stands
written
in
old
french
is
all
du

it
is
a
song
which
the
winnowers

to

pages
of
strange

on
the
character
of
winckelmann

speaks
of
the

who
had
made
his
career
possible
but
whom
he
had
never
seen
as
of
an
abstract
type

consummate
tranquil
withdrawn
already
into
the
region
of
ideals
yet
retaining
colour
from
the
incidents
of

passionate
intellectual
life
he
classes
him
with
certain
works

possessing
an
inexhaustible
gift
of
suggestion

which
criticism

return
again
and

with
renewed
freshness
hegel
in
his
lectures
on

the

has
also
passed
a
remarkable
judgment
on
writings
winckelmann
by
contemplation
of
the
ideal
works
of
the
ancients
received
a
sort
of
inspiration
through
which
he
opened
a
new
sense
for
the
study
of
art
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
those
who
in
the
sphere
of
art
have
known
how
to
initiate
a
new
organ
for
the
human
spirit
that
it
has
given
a
new
sense
that
it
has
laid
open
a
new
organ
is
the
highest
that
can
be
said
of
any
critical
effort
it
is
interesting
then

ask
what
kind
of

it
was

thus
laid
open

under
what
conditions
was

johann
joachim
winckelmann
was
born
at
stendal
in
brandenburg
in
the
year
the
child
of
a
poor
tradesman
he
passed
through
many
struggles
in
early
youth
the
memory
of
which
ever
remained
in
him
as
a
fitful
cause
of
dejection
in
in
the
full
emancipation
of
his
spirit
looking
over
the
beautiful
roman
prospect
he
writes
one
gets
spoiled
here
but
god
owed
me
this
in
my
youth
i
suffered
too
much
destined
to
assert
and
interpret
the
charm
of
the
hellenic
spirit
he
served
first
a
painful
apprenticeship
in
the
tarnished
intellectual
world
of
germany
in
the
earlier
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
passing
out
of
that
into
the
happy
light
of
the
antique
he
had
a
sense
of
exhilaration
almost
physical
we
find
him
as
a
child
in
the
dusky
precincts
of
a
german
school
hungrily
feeding
on
a
few
colourless
books
the
master
of
this
school
grows
blind
winckelmann
becomes
his
famulus
the
old
man
would
have
had
him
study
theology
winckelmann
free
of
the
library
chooses
rather
to
become
familiar
with
the
greek
classics
herodotus
and
homer
win
with
their
vowelled
greek
his
warmest
enthusiasm
whole
nights
of
fever
are
devoted
to
them
disturbing
dreams
of
an
odyssey
of
his
own
come
to
him
he
felt
in
himself
says
madame
de
staël
an
ardent
attraction
towards
the
south
in
german
imaginations
even
now
traces
are
often
to
be
found
of
that
love
of
the
sun
that
weariness
of
the
north
cette
fatigue
du
nord
which
carried
the
northern
peoples
away
into
the
countries
of
the
south
a
fine
sky
brings
to
birth
sentiments
not
unlike
the
love
of
fatherland
to
most
of
us
after
all
our
steps
towards
it
the
antique
world
in
spite
of
its
intense
outlines
its
own
perfect
still
remains
faint
and
remote
to
him
closely
limited
except
on
the
side
of
the
ideal
building
for
his
dark
poverty
a
house
not
made
with
hands
it
early
came
to
seem
more
real
than
the
present
in
the
fantastic
plans
of
foreign
travel
continually
passing
through
his
mind
to
egypt
for
instance
and
to
france
there
seems
always
to
be
rather
a
wistful
sense
of
something
lost
to
be
regained
than
the
desire
of
discovering
anything
new
goethe
has
told
us
how
in
his
eagerness
actually
to
handle
the
antique
he
became
interested
in
the
insignificant
vestiges
of
it
which
the
neighbourhood
of
strasburg
afforded
so
we
hear
of
winckelmann
boyish
antiquarian
wanderings
among
the
ugly
brandenburg
sandhills
such
a
conformity
between
himself
and
winckelmann
goethe
would
have
gladly
noted
at
he
enters
the
university
of
halle
to
study
theology
as
his
friends
desire
instead
he
becomes
the
enthusiastic
translator
of
herodotus
the
condition
of
greek
learning
in
german
schools
and
universities
had
fallen
and
there
were
no
professors
at
halle
who
could
satisfy
his
sharp
intellectual
craving
of
his
professional
education
he
always
speaks
with
scorn
claiming
to
have
been
his
own
teacher
from
first
to
last
his
appointed
teachers
did
not
perceive
that
a
new
source
of
culture
was
within
their
hands
homo
vagus
et
inconstans
one
of
them
pedantically
reports
of
the
future
pilgrim
to
rome
unaware
on
which
side
his
irony
was
whetted
when
professional
education
confers
nothing
but
irritation
on
a
schiller
no
one
ought
to
be
surprised
for
schiller
and
such
as
he
are
primarily
spiritual
adventurers
but
that
winckelmann
the
votary
of
the
gravest
of
intellectual
traditions
should
get
nothing
but
an
attempt
at
suppression
from
the
professional
guardians
of
learning
is
what
may
well
surprise
us
in
he
became
master
of
a
school
at
seehausen
this
was
the
most
wearisome
period
of
his
life
notwithstanding
a
success
in
dealing
with
children
which
seems
to
testify
to
something
simple
and
primeval
in
his
nature
he
found
the
work
of
teaching
very
depressing
engaged
in
this
work
he
writes
that
he
still
has
within
him
a
longing
desire
to
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
beauty
sehnlich
wünschte
zur
kenntniss
des
schönen
zu
gelangen
he
had
to
shorten
his
nights
sleeping
only
four
hours
to
gain
time
for
reading
and
here
winckelmann
made
a
step
forward
in
culture
he
multiplied
his
intellectual
force
by
detaching
from
it
all
flaccid
interests
he
renounced
mathematics
and
law
in
which
his
reading
had
been
considerable
all
but
the
literature
of
the
arts
nothing
was
to
enter
into
his
life
unpenetrated
by
its
central
enthusiasm
at
this
time
he
undergoes
the
charm
of
voltaire
voltaire
belongs
to
that
flimsier
more
artificial
classical
tradition
which
winckelmann
was
one
day
to
supplant
by
the
clear
ring
the
eternal
outline
of
the
genuine
antique
but
it
proves
the
authority
of
such
a
gift
as
voltaire
that
it
allures
and
wins
even
those
born
to
supplant
it
voltaire
impression
on
winckelmann
was
never
effaced
and
it
gave
him
a
consideration
for
french
literature
which
contrasts
with
his
contempt
for
the
literary
products
of
germany
german
literature
transformed
siderealised
as
we
see
it
in
goethe
reckons
winckelmann
among
its
initiators
but
germany
at
that
time
presented
nothing
in
which
he
could
have
anticipated
iphigenie
and
the
formation
of
an
effective
classical
tradition
in
german
literature
under
this
purely
literary
influence
winckelmann
protests
against
christian
wolff
and
the
philosophers
goethe
in
speaking
of
this
protest
alludes
to
his
own
obligations
to
emmanuel
kant
kant
influence
over
the
culture
of
goethe
which
he
tells
us
could
not
have
been
resisted
by
him
without
loss
consisted
in
a
severe
limitation
to
the
concrete
but
he
adds
that
in
born
antiquaries
like
winckelmann
a
constant
handling
of
the
antique
with
its
eternal
outline
maintains
that
limitation
as
effectually
as
a
critical
philosophy
plato
however
saved
so
often
for
his
redeeming
literary
manner
is
excepted
from
winckelmann
proscription
of
the
philosophers
the
modern
student
most
often
meets
plato
on
that
side
which
seems
to
pass
beyond
plato
into
a
world
no
longer
pagan
based
upon
the
conception
of
a
spiritual
life
but
the
element
of
affinity
which
he
presents
to
winckelmann
is
that
which
is
wholly
greek
and
alien
from
the
christian
world
represented
by
that
group
of
brilliant
youths
in
the
lysis
still
uninfected
by
any
spiritual
sickness
finding
the
end
of
all
endeavour
in
the
aspects
of
the
human
form
the
continual
stir
and
motion
of
a
comely
human
life
this
interest
in
plato
dialogues
could
not
fail
to
increase
his
desire
to
visit
the
countries
of
the
classical
tradition
it
is
my
misfortune
he
writes
that
i
was
not
born
to
great
place
wherein
i
might
have
had
cultivation
and
the
opportunity
of
following
my
instinct
and
forming
myself
a
visit
to
rome
probably
was
already
designed
and
he
silently
preparing
for
it
count
bünau
the
author
of
a
historical
work
then
of
note
had
collected
at
nöthenitz
a
valuable
library
now
part
of
the
library
of
dresden
in
winckelmann
wrote
to
bünau
in
halting
french
he
is
emboldened
he
says
by
indulgence
for
needy
men
of
letters
he
desires
only
to
devote
himself
to
study
having
never
allowed
himself
to
be
dazzled
by
favourable
prospects
in
the
church
he
hints
at
his
doubtful
position
in
a
metaphysical
age
by
which
humane
literature
is
trampled
under
foot
at
present
he
goes
on
little
value
is
set
on
greek
literature
to
which
i
have
devoted
myself
so
far
as
i
could
penetrate
when
good
books
are
so
scarce
and
expensive
finally
he
desires
a
place
in
some
corner
of
bünau
library
perhaps
at
some
future
time
i
shall
become
more
useful
to
the
public
if
drawn
from
obscurity
in
whatever
way
i
can
find
means
to
maintain
myself
in
the
capital
soon
afterwards
we
find
winckelmann
in
the
library
at
nöthenitz
thence
he
made
many
visits
to
the
collection
of
antiquities
at
dresden
he
became
acquainted
with
many
artists
above
all
with
oeser
goethe
future
friend
and
master
who
uniting
a
high
culture
with
the
practical
knowledge
of
art
was
fitted
to
minister
to
winckelmann
culture
and
now
a
new
channel
of
communion
with
the
greek
life
was
opened
for
him
hitherto
he
had
handled
the
words
only
of
greek
poetry
stirred
indeed
and
roused
by
them
yet
divining
beyond
the
words
some
unexpressed
pulsation
of
sensuous
life
suddenly
he
is
in
contact
with
that
life
still
fervent
in
the
relics
of
plastic
art
filled
as
our
culture
is
with
the
classical
spirit
we
can
hardly
imagine
how
deeply
the
human
mind
was
moved
when
at
the
renaissance
in
the
midst
of
a
frozen
world
the
buried
fire
of
ancient
art
rose
up
from
under
the
soil
winckelmann
here
reproduces
for
us
the
earlier
sentiment
of
the
renaissance
on
a
sudden
the
imagination
feels
itself
free
how
facile
and
direct
it
seems
to
say
is
this
life
of
the
senses
and
the
understanding
when
once
we
have
apprehended
it
here
surely
is
that
more
liberal
mode
of
life
we
have
been
seeking
so
long
so
near
to
us
all
the
while
how
mistaken
and
roundabout
have
been
our
efforts
to
reach
it
by
mystic
passion
and
monastic
reverie
how
they
have
deflowered
the
flesh
how
little
have
they
really
emancipated
us
hermione
melts
from
her
stony
posture
and
the
lost
proportions
of
life
right
themselves
here
then
in
vivid
realisation
we
see
the
native
tendency
of
winckelmann
to
escape
from
abstract
theory
to
intuition
to
the
exercise
of
sight
and
touch
lessing
in
the
laocoon
has
theorised
finely
on
the
relation
of
poetry
to
sculpture
and
philosophy
may
give
us
theoretical
reasons
why
not
poetry
but
sculpture
should
be
the
most
sincere
and
exact
expression
of
the
greek
ideal
by
a
happy
unperplexed
dexterity
winckelmann
solves
the
question
in
the
concrete
it
is
what
goethe
calls
his
gewahrwerden
der
griechischen
kunst
his
finding
of
greek
art
through
the
tumultuous
richness
of
goethe
culture
the
influence
of
winckelmann
is
always
discernible
as
the
strong
regulative
of
a
clear
antique
motive
one
learns
nothing
from
him
he
says
to
eckermann
but
one
becomes
something
if
we
ask
what
the
secret
of
this
influence
was
goethe
himself
will
tell
us
wholeness
unity
with
one
self
intellectual
integrity
and
yet
these
expressions
because
they
fit
goethe
with
his
universal
culture
so
well
seem
hardly
to
describe
the
narrow
exclusive
interest
of
winckelmann
doubtless
winckelmann
perfection
is
a
narrow
perfection
his
feverish
nursing
of
the
one
motive
of
his
life
is
a
contrast
to
goethe
various
energy
but
what
affected
goethe
what
instructed
him
and
ministered
to
his
culture
was
the
integrity
the
truth
to
its
type
of
the
given
force
the
development
of
this
force
was
the
single
interest
of
winckelmann
unembarrassed
by
anything
else
in
him
other
interests
practical
or
intellectual
those
slighter
talents
and
motives
not
supreme
which
in
most
men
are
the
waste
part
of
nature
and
drain
away
their
vitality
he
plucked
out
and
cast
from
him
the
protracted
longing
of
his
youth
is
not
a
vague
romantic
longing
he
knows
what
he
longs
for
what
he
wills
within
its
severe
limits
his
enthusiasm
burns
like
lava
you
know
says
lavater
speaking
of
winckelmann
countenance
that
i
consider
ardour
and
indifference
by
no
means
incompatible
in
the
same
character
if
ever
there
was
a
striking
instance
of
that
union
it
is
in
the
countenance
before
us
a
lowly
childhood
says
goethe
insufficient
instruction
in
youth
broken
distracted
studies
in
early
manhood
the
burden
of
he
was
thirty
years
old
before
he
enjoyed
a
single
favour
of
fortune
but
so
soon
as
he
had
attained
to
an
adequate
condition
of
freedom
he
appears
before
us
consummate
and
entire
complete
in
the
ancient
sense
but
his
hair
is
turning
grey
and
he
has
not
yet
reached
the
south
the
saxon
court
had
become
roman
catholic
and
the
way
to
favour
at
dresden
was
through
roman
ecclesiastics
probably
the
thought
of
a
profession
of
the
papal
religion
was
not
new
to
winckelmann
at
one
time
he
had
thought
of
begging
his
way
to
rome
from
cloister
to
cloister
under
the
pretence
of
a
disposition
to
change
his
faith
in
the
papal
nuncio
archinto
was
one
of
the
visitors
at
nöthenitz
he
suggested
rome
as
the
fitting
stage
for
winckelmann
accomplishments
and
held
out
the
hope
of
a
place
in
the
pope
library
cardinal
passionei
charmed
with
winckelmann
beautiful
greek
writing
was
ready
to
play
the
part
of
maecenas
if
the
indispensable
change
were
made
winckelmann
accepted
the
bribe
and
visited
the
nuncio
at
dresden
unquiet
still
at
the
word
profession
not
without
a
struggle
he
joined
the
roman
church
july
the
goethe
boldly
pleads
that
winckelmann
was
a
pagan
that
the
landmarks
of
christendom
meant
nothing
to
him
it
is
clear
that
he
intended
to
deceive
no
one
by
his
disguise
fears
of
the
inquisition
are
sometimes
visible
during
his
life
in
rome
he
entered
rome
notoriously
with
the
works
of
voltaire
in
his
possession
the
thought
of
what
count
bünau
might
be
thinking
of
him
seems
to
have
been
his
greatest
difficulty
on
the
other
hand
he
may
have
had
a
sense
of
a
certain
antique
and
as
it
were
pagan
grandeur
in
the
roman
catholic
religion
turning
from
the
crabbed
protestantism
which
had
been
the
ennui
of
his
youth
he
might
reflect
that
while
rome
had
reconciled
itself
to
the
renaissance
the
protestant
principle
in
art
had
cut
off
germany
from
the
supreme
tradition
of
beauty
and
yet
to
that
transparent
nature
with
its
simplicity
as
of
the
earlier
world
the
loss
of
absolute
sincerity
must
have
been
a
real
loss
goethe
understands
that
winckelmann
had
made
this
sacrifice
yet
at
the
bar
of
the
highest
criticism
perhaps
winckelmann
may
be
absolved
the
insincerity
of
his
religious
profession
was
only
one
incident
of
a
culture
in
which
the
moral
instinct
like
the
religious
or
political
was
merged
in
the
artistic
but
then
the
artistic
interest
was
that
by
desperate
faithfulness
to
which
winckelmann
was
saved
from
the
mediocrity
which
breaking
through
no
bounds
moves
ever
in
a
bloodless
routine
and
misses
its
one
chance
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
and
the
intellect
there
have
been
instances
of
culture
developed
by
every
high
motive
in
turn
and
yet
intense
at
every
point
and
the
aim
of
our
culture
should
be
to
attain
not
only
as
intense
but
as
complete
a
life
as
possible
but
often
the
higher
life
is
only
possible
at
all
on
condition
of
the
selection
of
that
in
which
one
motive
is
native
and
strong
and
this
selection
involves
the
renunciation
of
a
crown
reserved
for
others
which
is
better
to
lay
open
a
new
sense
to
initiate
a
new
organ
for
the
human
spirit
or
to
cultivate
many
types
of
perfection
up
to
a
point
which
leaves
us
still
beyond
the
range
of
their
transforming
power
savonarola
is
one
type
of
success
winckelmann
is
another
criticism
can
reject
neither
because
each
is
true
to
itself
winckelmann
himself
explains
the
motive
of
his
life
when
he
says
it
will
be
my
highest
reward
if
posterity
acknowledges
that
i
have
written
worthily
for
a
time
he
remained
at
dresden
there
his
first
book
appeared
thoughts
on
the
imitation
of
greek
works
of
art
in
painting
and
sculpture
full
of
obscurities
as
it
was
obscurities
which
baffled
but
did
not
offend
goethe
when
he
first
turned
to
its
purpose
was
direct
an
appeal
from
the
artificial
classicism
of
the
day
to
the
study
of
the
antique
the
book
was
well
received
and
a
pension
supplied
through
the
confessor
in
september
he
started
for
rome
in
the
company
of
a
young
jesuit
he
was
introduced
to
raphael
mengs
a
painter
then
of
note
and
found
a
home
near
him
in
the
artists
quarter
in
a
place
where
he
could
overlook
far
and
wide
the
eternal
city
at
first
he
was
perplexed
with
the
sense
of
being
a
stranger
on
what
was
to
him
spiritually
native
soil
unhappily
he
cries
in
french
often
selected
by
him
as
the
vehicle
of
strong
feeling
i
am
one
of
those
whom
the
greeks
call
i
have
come
into
the
world
and
into
italy
too
late
more
than
thirty
years
afterwards
goethe
also
after
many
aspirations
and
severe
preparation
of
mind
visited
italy
in
early
manhood
just
as
he
too
was
finding
greek
art
the
rumour
of
that
true
artist
life
of
winckelmann
in
italy
had
strongly
moved
him
at
rome
spending
a
whole
year
drawing
from
the
antique
in
preparation
for
iphigenie
he
finds
the
stimulus
of
winckelmann
memory
ever
active
winckelmann
roman
life
was
simple
primeval
greek
his
delicate
constitution
permitted
him
the
use
only
of
bread
and
wine
condemned
by
many
as
a
renegade
he
had
no
desire
for
places
of
honour
but
only
to
see
his
merits
acknowledged
and
existence
assured
to
him
he
was
simple
without
being
niggardly
he
desired
to
be
neither
poor
nor
rich
winckelmann
first
years
in
rome
present
all
the
elements
of
an
intellectual
situation
of
the
highest
interest
the
beating
of
the
soul
against
its
bars
the
sombre
aspect
the
alien
traditions
the
still
barbarous
literature
of
germany
are
afar
off
before
him
are
adequate
conditions
of
culture
the
sacred
soil
itself
the
first
tokens
of
the
advent
of
the
new
german
literature
with
its
broad
horizons
its
boundless
intellectual
promise
dante
passing
from
the
darkness
of
the
inferno
is
filled
with
a
sharp
and
joyful
sense
of
light
which
makes
him
deal
with
it
in
the
opening
of
the
purgatorio
in
a
wonderfully
touching
and
penetrative
way
hellenism
which
is
the
principle
of
intellectual
light
our
modern
culture
may
have
more
colour
the
medieval
spirit
greater
heat
and
profundity
but
hellenism
is
for
light
has
always
been
most
effectively
conceived
by
those
who
have
crept
into
it
out
of
an
intellectual
world
in
which
the
sombre
elements
predominate
so
it
had
been
in
the
ages
of
the
renaissance
this
repression
removed
at
last
gave
force
and
glow
to
winckelmann
native
affinity
to
the
hellenic
spirit
there
had
been
known
before
him
says
madame
de
staël
learned
men
who
might
be
consulted
like
books
but
no
one
had
if
i
may
say
so
made
himself
a
pagan
for
the
purpose
of
penetrating
antiquity
one
is
always
a
poor
executant
of
conceptions
not
one
own
on
exécute
mal
ce
pas

are
true
in
their
measure
of
every
genuine
enthusiasm
enthusiasm
that
in
the
broad
platonic
sense
of
the
phaedrus
was
the
secret
of
his
divinatory
power
over
the
hellenic
world
this
enthusiasm
dependent
as
it
is
to
a
great
degree
on
bodily
temperament
has
a
power
of
the
purer
emotions
of
the
intellect
with
an
almost
physical
excitement
that
his
affinity
with
hellenism
was
not
merely
intellectual
that
the
subtler
threads
of
temperament
were
inwoven
in
it
is
proved
by
his
romantic
fervent
friendships
with
young
men
he
has
known
he
says
many
young
men
more
beautiful
than
guido
archangel
these
friendships
bringing
him
into
contact
with
the
pride
of
human
form
and
staining
the
thoughts
with
its
bloom
perfected
his
reconciliation
to
the
spirit
of
greek
sculpture
a
letter
on
taste
addressed
from
rome
to
a
young
nobleman
friedrich
von
berg
is
the
record
of
such
a
friendship
i
shall
excuse
my
delay
he
begins
in
fulfilling
my
promise
of
an
essay
on
the
taste
for
beauty
in
works
of
art
in
the
words
of
pindar
he
says
to
agesidamus
a
youth
of
locri
idea
te
kalon
hôra
te
kekramenon
whom
he
had
kept
waiting
for
an
intended
ode
that
a
debt
paid
with
usury
is
the
end
of
reproach
this
may
win
your
on
behalf
of
my
present
essay
which
has
turned
out
far
more
detailed
and
circumstantial
than
i
had
at
first
intended
it
is
from
yourself
that
the
subject
is
taken
our
intercourse
has
been
short
too
short
both
for
you
and
me
but
the
first
time
i
saw
you
the
affinity
of
our
spirits
was
revealed
to
me
your
culture
proved
that
my
hope
was
not
groundless
and
i
found
in
a
beautiful
body
a
soul
created
for
nobleness
gifted
with
the
sense
of
beauty
my
parting
from
you
was
therefore
one
of
the
most
painful
in
my
life
and
that
this
feeling
continues
our
common
friend
is
witness
for
your
separation
from
me
leaves
me
no
hope
of
seeing
you
again
let
this
essay
be
a
memorial
of
our
friendship
which
on
my
side
is
free
from
every
selfish
motive
and
ever
remains
subject
and
dedicate
to
yourself
alone
the
following
passage
is
characteristic
as
it
is
confessedly
the
beauty
of
man
which
is
to
be
conceived
under
one
general
idea
so
i
have
noticed
that
those
who
are
observant
of
beauty
only
in
women
and
are
moved
little
or
not
at
all
by
the
beauty
of
men
seldom
have
an
impartial
vital
inborn
instinct
for
beauty
in
art
to
such
persons
the
beauty
of
greek
art
will
ever
seem
wanting
because
its
supreme
beauty
is
rather
male
than
female
but
the
beauty
of
art
demands
a
higher
sensibility
than
the
beauty
of
nature
because
the
beauty
of
art
like
tears
shed
at
a
play
gives
no
pain
is
without
life
and
must
be
awakened
and
repaired
by
culture
now
as
the
spirit
of
culture
is
much
more
ardent
in
youth
than
in
manhood
the
instinct
of
which
i
am
speaking
must
be
exercised
and
directed
to
what
is
beautiful
before
that
age
is
reached
at
which
one
would
be
afraid
to
confess
that
one
had
no
taste
for
it
certainly
of
that
beauty
of
living
form
which
regulated
winckelmann
friendships
it
could
not
be
said
that
it
gave
no
pain
one
notable
friendship
the
fortune
of
which
we
may
trace
through
his
letters
begins
with
an
antique
chivalrous
letter
in
french
and
ends
noisily
in
a
burst
of
angry
fire
far
from
reaching
the
quietism
the
bland
indifference
of
art
such
attachments
are
nevertheless
more
susceptible
than
any
others
of
equal
strength
of
a
purely
intellectual
culture
of
passion
of
physical
excitement
they
contain
only
just
so
much
as
stimulates
the
eye
to
the
finest
delicacies
of
colour
and
form
these
friendships
often
the
caprices
of
a
moment
make
winckelmann
letters
with
their
troubled
colouring
an
instructive
but
bizarre
addition
to
the
history
of
art
that
shrine
of
grave
and
mellow
light
around
the
mute
olympian
family
the
impression
which
winckelmann
literary
life
conveyed
to
those
about
him
was
that
of
excitement
intuition
inspiration
rather
than
the
contemplative
evolution
of
general
principles
the
quick
susceptible
enthusiast
betraying
his
temperament
even
in
appearance
by
his
olive
complexion
his
piercing
eyes
his
rapid
movements
apprehended
the
subtlest
principles
of
the
hellenic
manner
not
through
the
understanding
but
by
instinct
or
touch
a
german
biographer
of
winckelmann
has
compared
him
to
columbus
that
is
not
the
aptest
of
comparisons
but
it
reminds
one
of
a
passage
in
which
edgar
quinet
describes
the
great
discoverer
famous
voyage
his
science
was
often
at
fault
but
he
had
a
way
of
estimating
at
once
the
slightest
indication
of
land
in
a
floating
weed
or
passing
bird
he
seemed
actually
to
come
nearer
to
nature
than
other
men
and
that
world
in
which
others
had
moved
with
so
much
embarrassment
seems
to
call
out
in
winckelmann
new
senses
fitted
to
deal
with
it
he
is
in
touch
with
it
it
penetrates
him
and
becomes
part
of
his
temperament
he
remodels
his
writings
with
constant
renewal
of
insight
he
catches
the
thread
of
a
whole

had
formed
in
his

a
precious

had
just
opened
its
treasures
winckelmann
gathered
its
but
his
plan
of
a
visit
to
greece
remained
unfulfilled
from
his
first
arrival
in
rome
he
had
kept
the
history
of
ancient
art
ever
in
view
all
his
other
writings
were
a
preparation
for
that
it
appeared
finally
in
but
even
after
its
publication
winckelmann
was
still
employed
in
perfecting
it
it
is
since
his
time
that
many
of
the
most
significant
examples
of
greek
art
have
been
submitted
to
criticism
he
had
seen
little
or
nothing
of
what
we
ascribe
to
the
age
of
pheidias
and
his
conception
of
greek
art
tends
therefore
to
put
the
mere
elegance
of
the
imperial
society
of
ancient
rome
in
place
of
the
severe
and
chastened
grace
of
the
palaestra
for
the
most
part
he
had
to
penetrate
to
greek
art
through
copies
imitations
and
later
roman
art
itself
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
turbid
medium
has
left
in
winckelmann
actual
results
much
that
a
more
privileged
criticism
can
correct
he
had
been
twelve
years
in
rome
admiring
germany
had
made
many
calls
to
him
at
last
in
he
set
out
to
revisit
the
country
of
his
birth
and
as
he
left
rome
a
strange
inverted
a
strange
reluctance
to
leave
it
at
all
came
over
him
he
reached
vienna
there
he
was
loaded
with
honours
and
presents
other
cities
were
awaiting
him
goethe
then
nineteen
years
old
studying
art
at
leipsic
was
expecting
his
coming
with
that
wistful
eagerness
which
marked
his
youth
when
the
news
of
winckelmann
murder
arrived
all
his
weariness
of
the
north
had
revived
with
double
force
he
left
vienna
intending
to
hasten
back
to
rome
and
at
trieste
a
delay
of
a
few
days
occurred
with
characteristic
openness
winckelmann
had
confided
his
plans
to
a
a
man
named
arcangeli
and
had
shown
him
the
gold
medals
received
at
vienna
arcangeli
avarice
was
aroused
one
morning
he
entered
winckelmann
room
under
pretence
of
taking
leave
winckelmann
was
then
writing
memoranda
for
the
future
editor
of
the
history
of
art
still
seeking
the
perfection
of
his
great
work
arcangeli
begged
to
see
the
medals
once
more
as
winckelmann
stooped
down
to
take
them
from
the
chest
a
cord
was
thrown
round
his
neck
some
time
afterwards
a
child
with
whose
companionship
winckelmann
had
beguiled
his
delay
knocked
at
the
door
and
receiving
no
answer
gave
the
alarm
winckelmann
was
found
dangerously
wounded
and
died
a
few
hours
later
after
receiving
the
last
sacraments
it
seemed
as
if
the
gods
in
reward
for
his
devotion
to
them
had
given
him
a
death
which
for
its
swiftness
and
its
opportunity
he
might
well
have
desired
he
has
says
goethe
the
advantage
of
figuring
in
the
memory
of
posterity
as
one
eternally
able
and
strong
for
the
image
in
which
one
leaves
the
world
is
that
in
which
one
moves
among
the
shadows
yet
perhaps
it
is
not
fanciful
to
regret
that
his
proposed
meeting
with
goethe
never
took
place
goethe
then
in
all
the
pregnancy
of
his
wonderful
youth
still
unruffled
by
the
press
and
storm
of
his
earlier
manhood
was
awaiting
winckelmann
with
a
curiosity
of
the
worthiest
kind
as
it
was
winckelmann
became
to
him
something
like
what
virgil
was
to
dante
and
winckelmann
with
his
fiery
friendships
had
reached
that
age
and
that
period
of
culture
at
which
emotions
hitherto
fitful
sometimes
concentrate
themselves
in
a
vital
unchangeable
relationship
german
literary
history
seems
to
have
lost
the
chance
of
one
of
those
famous
friendships
the
very
tradition
of
which
becomes
a
stimulus
to
culture
and
exercises
an
imperishable
influence
in
one
of
the
frescoes
of
the
vatican

of
the
catholic
religion

of

it
is
the
classical

the
orthodoxy
of
taste
that
raphael
commemorates
winckelmann
intellectual
history
authenticates
the
claims
of
this
tradition
in
human
culture
in
the
countries
where
that
tradition
arose
where
it
still
lurked
about
its
own
artistic
relics
and
changes
of
language
had
not
broken
its
continuity
national
pride
might
sometimes
light
up
anew
an
enthusiasm
for
it
aliens
might
imitate
that
enthusiasm
and
classicism
become
from
time
to
time
an
intellectual
fashion
but
winckelmann
was
not
further
removed
by
language
than
by
local
aspects
and
associations
from
those
vestiges
of
the
classical
spirit
and
he
lived
at
a
time
when
in
germany
classical
studies
were
out
of
favour
yet
remote
in
time
and
place
he
feels
after
the
hellenic
world
divines
those
channels
of
ancient
art
in
which
its
life
still
circulates
and
like
scyles
the
yet
hellenising
king
in
the
beautiful
story
of
herodotus
is
irresistibly
attracted
by
it
this
testimony
to
the
authority
of
the
hellenic
tradition
its
fitness
to
satisfy
some
vital
requirement
of
the
intellect
which
winckelmann
contributes
as
a
solitary
man
of
genius
is
offered
also
by
the
general
history
of
the
mind
the
spiritual
forces
of
the
past
which
have
prompted
and
informed
the
culture
of
a
succeeding
age
live
indeed
within
that
culture
but
with
an
absorbed
underground
life
the
hellenic
element
alone
has
not
been
so
absorbed
or
content
with
this
underground
life
from
time
to
time
it
has
started
to
the
surface
culture
has
been
drawn
back
to
its
sources
to
be
clarified
and
corrected
hellenism
is
not
merely
an
absorbed
element
in
our
intellectual
life
it
is
a
conscious
tradition
in
it
again
individual
genius
works
ever
under
conditions
of
time
and
place
its
products
are
coloured
by
the
varying
aspects
of
nature
and
type
of
human
form
and
outward
manners
of
life
there
is
thus
an
element
of
change
in
art
criticism
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
that
the
artist
is
the
child
of
his
time
but
besides
these
conditions
of
time
and
place
and
independent
of
them
there
is
also
an
element
of
permanence
a
standard
of
taste
which
genius
confesses
this
standard
is
maintained
in
a
purely
intellectual
tradition
it
acts
upon
the
artist
not
as
one
of
the
influences
of
his
own
age
but
through
those
artistic
products
of
the
previous
generation
which
first
excited
while
they
directed
into
a
particular
channel
his
sense
of
beauty
the
supreme
artistic
products
of
succeeding
generations
thus
form
a
series
of
elevated
points
taking
each
from
each
the
reflection
of
a
strange
light
the
source
of
which
is
not
in
the
atmosphere
around
and
above
them
but
in
a
stage
of
society
remote
from
ours
the
standard
of
taste
then
was
fixed
in
greece
at
a
definite
historical
period
a
tradition
for
all
succeeding
generations
it
originates
in
a
spontaneous
growth
out
of
the
influences
of
greek
society
what
were
the
conditions
under
which
this
ideal
this
standard
of
artistic
orthodoxy
was
generated
how
was
greece
enabled
to
force
its
thought
upon
europe
greek
art
when
we
first
catch
sight
of
it
is
entangled
with
greek
religion
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
greek
religion
as
the
religion
of
art
and
beauty
the
religion
of
which
the
olympian
zeus
and
the
athena
polias
are
the
idols
the
poems
of
homer
the
sacred
books
thus
cardinal
newman
speaks
of
the
classical
polytheism
which
was
gay
and
graceful
as
was
natural
in
a
civilised
age
yet
such
a
view
is
only
a
partial
one
in
it
the
eye
is
fixed
on
the
sharp
bright
edge
of
high
hellenic
culture
but
loses
sight
of
the
sombre
world
across
which
it
strikes
greek
religion
where
we
can
observe
it
most
distinctly
is
at
once
a
magnificent
ritualistic
system
and
a
cycle
of
poetical
conceptions
religions
as
they
grow
by
natural
laws
out
of
man
life
are
modified
by
whatever
modifies
his
life
they
brighten
under
a
bright
sky
they
become
liberal
as
the
social
range
widens
they
grow
intense
and
shrill
in
the
clefts
of
human
life
where
the
spirit
is
narrow
and
confined
and
the
stars
are
visible
at
noonday
and
a
fine
analysis
of
these
differences
is
one
of
the
gravest
functions
of
religious
criticism
still
the
broad
foundation
in
mere
human
nature
of
all
religions
as
they
exist
for
the
greatest
number
is
a
universal
pagan
sentiment
a
paganism
which
existed
before
the
greek
religion
and
has
lingered
far
onward
into
the
christian
world
ineradicable
like
some
persistent
vegetable
growth
because
its
seed
is
an
element
of
the
very
soil
out
of
which
it
springs
this
pagan
sentiment
measures
the
sadness
with
which
the
human
mind
is
filled
whenever
its
thoughts
wander
far
from
what
is
here
and
now
it
is
beset
by
notions
of
irresistible
natural
powers
for
the
most
part
ranged
against
man
but
the
secret
also
of
his
fortune
making
the
earth
golden
and
the
grape
fiery
for
him
he
makes
gods
in
his
own
image
gods
smiling
and
crowned
or
bleeding
by
some
sad
fatality
to
console
him
by
their
wounds
never
closed
from
generation
to
generation
it
is
with
a
rush
of
that
the
thought
of
death
presents
itself
he
would
remain
at
home
for
ever
on
the
earth
if
he
could
as
it
loses
its
colour
and
the
senses
fail
he
clings
ever
closer
to
it
but
since
the
mouldering
of
bones
and
flesh
must
go
on
to
the
end
he
is
careful
for
charms
and
talismans
which
may
chance
to
have
some
friendly
power
in
them
when
the
inevitable
shipwreck
comes
such
sentiment
is
a
part
of
the
eternal
basis
of
all
religions
modified
indeed
by
changes
of
time
and
place
but
indestructible
because
its
root
is
so
deep
in
the
earth
of
nature
the
breath
of
religious
initiators
passes
over
them
a
few
rise
up
with
wings
as
eagles
but
the
broad
level
of
religious
life
is
not
permanently
changed
religious
progress
like
all
purely
spiritual
progress
is
confined
to
a
few
this
sentiment
attaches
itself
in
the
earliest
times
to
certain
usages
of
patriarchal
life
the
kindling
of
fire
the
washing
of
the
body
the
slaughter
of
the
flock
the
gathering
of
harvest
holidays
and
dances
here
are
the
beginnings
of
a
ritual
at
first
as
occasional
and
unfixed
as
the
sentiment
which
it
expresses
but
destined
to
become
the
permanent
element
of
religious
life
the
usages
of
patriarchal
life
change
but
this
germ
of
ritual
remains
promoted
now
with
a
consciously
religious
motive
losing
its
domestic
character
and
therefore
becoming
more
and
more
inexplicable
with
each
generation
such
pagan
worship
in
spite
of
local
variations
essentially
one
is
an
element
in
all
religions
it
is
the
anodyne
which
the
religious
principle
like
one
administering
opiates
to
the
incurable
has
added
to
the
law
which
makes
life
sombre
for
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
more
definite
religious
conceptions
come
from
other
sources
and
fix
themselves
upon
this
ritual
in
various
ways
changing
it
and
giving
it
new
meanings
in
greece
they
were
derived
from
mythology
itself
not
due
to
a
religious
source
at
all
but
developing
in
the
course
of
time
into
a
body
of
religious
conceptions
entirely
human
in
form
and
character
to
the
unprogressive
ritual
element
it
brought
these
conceptions
hę
pterou
dynamis
the
power
of
the
wing
an
element
of
refinement
of
ascension
with
the
promise
of
an
endless
destiny
while
the
ritual
remains
unchanged
the
aesthetic
element
only
accidentally
connected
with
it
expands
with
the
freedom
and
mobility
of
the
things
of
the
intellect
always
the
fixed
element
is
the
religious
observance
the
fluid
unfixed
element
is
the
myth
the
religious
conception
this
religion
is
itself
pagan
and
has
in
any
broad
view
of
it
the
pagan
sadness
it
does
not
at
once
and
for
the
majority
become
the
higher
hellenic
religion
the
country
people
of
course
cherish
the
unlovely
idols
of
an
earlier
time
such
as
those
which
pausanias
found
still
devoutly
preserved
in
arcadia
athenaeus
tells
the
story
of
one
who
coming
to
a
temple
of
latona
had
expected
to
find
some
worthy
presentment
of
the
mother
of
apollo
and
laughed
on
seeing
only
a
shapeless
wooden
figure
the
wilder
people
have
wilder
gods
which
however
in
athens
or
corinth
or
lacedaemon
changing
ever
with
the
worshippers
in
whom
they
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
borrow
something
of
the
lordliness
and
distinction
of
human
nature
there
greek
religion
too
has
its
mendicants
its
purifications
its
antinomian
mysticism
its
garments
offered
to
the
gods
its
statues
worn
with
kissing
its
exaggerated
superstitions
for
the
vulgar
only
its
worship
of
sorrow
its
addolorata
its
mournful
mysteries
scarcely
a
wild
or
melancholy
note
of
the
medieval
church
but
was
anticipated
by
greek
polytheism
what
should
we
have
thought
of
the
vertiginous
prophetess
at
the
very
centre
of
greek
religion
the
supreme
hellenic
culture
is
a
sharp
edge
of
light
across
this
gloom
the
fiery
stupefying
wine
becomes
in
a
happier
climate
clear
and
exhilarating
the
dorian
worship
of
apollo
rational
chastened
debonair
with
his
unbroken
daylight
always
opposed
to
the
sad
chthonian
divinities
is
the
aspiring
element
by
force
and
spring
of
which
greek
religion
sublimes
itself
out
of
greek
religion
under
happy
conditions
arises
greek
art
to
minister
to
human
culture
it
was
the
privilege
of
greek
religion
to
be
able
to
transform
itself
into
an
artistic
ideal
for
the
thoughts
of
the
greeks
about
themselves
and
their
relation
to
the
world
generally
were
ever
in
the
happiest
readiness
to
be
transformed
into
objects
for
the
senses
in
this
lies
the
main
distinction
between
greek
art
and
the
mystical
art
of
the
christian
middle
age
which
is
always
struggling
to
express
thoughts
beyond
itself
take
for
instance
a
characteristic
work
of
the
middle
age
angelico
coronation
of
the
virgin
in
the
cloister
of
saint
mark
at
florence
in
some
strange
halo
of
a
moon
jesus
and
the
virgin
mother
are
seated
clad
in

white
raiment
half
shroud
half
priestly
linen
jesus
with

nimbus
and
the
long
pale

of
the
figure
in
the
apocalypse
with
slender
is
setting
a
crown
of
pearl
on
the
head
of
mary
who
like
in
her
refinement
is
bending
forward
to
receive
it
the
light
lying
like
snow
upon
her
forehead
certainly
it
can
not
be
said
of
angelico
fresco
that
it
throws
into
a
sensible
form
our
highest
thoughts
about
man
and
his
relation
to
the
world
but
it
did
not
do
this
adequately
even
for
angelico
for
him
all
that
is
outward
or
sensible
in
his
work
the
hair
like
wool
the
rosy
nimbus
the
crown
of
pearl
is
only
the
symbol
or
type
of
a
really
inexpressible
world
to
which
he
wishes
to
direct
the
thoughts
he
would
have
shrunk
from
the
notion
that
what
the
eye
apprehended
was
all
such
forms
of
art
then
are
inadequate
to
the
matter
they
clothe
they
remain
ever
below
its
level
something
of
this
kind
is
true
also
of
oriental
art
as
in
the
middle
age
from
an
exaggerated
inwardness
so
in
the
east
from
a
vagueness
a
want
of
definition
in
thought
the
matter
presented
to
art
is
unmanageable
and
the
forms
of
sense
struggle
vainly
with
it
the
gods
of
the
east
the
orientalised
diana
of
ephesus
like
angelico
fresco
are
at
best
overcharged
symbols
a
means
of
hinting
at
an
idea
which
art
can
not
fitly
or
completely
express
which
still
remains
in
the
world
of
shadows
but
take
a
work
of
greek
art
the
venus
of
melos
that
is
in
no
sense
a
symbol
a
suggestion
of
anything
beyond
its
own
victorious
fairness
the
mind
begins
and
ends
with
the
finite
image
yet
loses
no
part
of
the
spiritual
motive
that
motive
is
not
lightly
and
loosely
attached
to
the
sensuous
form
as
its
meaning
to
an
allegory
but
saturates
and
is
identical
with
it
the
greek
mind
had
advanced
to
a
particular
stage
of
but
was
careful
not
to
pass
beyond
it
in
oriental
thought
there
is
a
vague
conception
of
life
everywhere
but
no
true
appreciation
of
itself
by
the
mind
no
knowledge
of
the
distinction
of
nature
in
its
consciousness
of
itself
humanity
is
still
confused
with
the
fantastic
indeterminate
life
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
in
greek
thought
on
the
other
hand
the
lordship
of
the
soul
is
recognised
that
lordship
gives
authority
and
divinity
to
human
eyes
and
hands
and
feet
inanimate
nature
is
thrown
into
the
background
but
just
there
greek
thought
finds
its
happy
limit
it
has
not
yet
become
too
inward
the
mind
has
not
yet
learned
to
boast
its
independence
of
the
flesh
the
spirit
has
not
yet
absorbed
everything
with
its
emotions
nor
reflected
its
own
colour
everywhere
it
has
indeed
committed
itself
to
a
train
of
reflexion
which
must
end
in
defiance
of
form
of
all
that
is
outward
in
an
exaggerated
idealism
but
that
end
is
still
distant
it
has
not
yet
plunged
into
the
depths
of
religious
mysticism
this
ideal
art
in
which
the
thought
does
not
outstrip
or
lie
beyond
the
proper
range
of
its
sensible
embodiment
could
not
have
arisen
out
of
a
phase
of
life
that
was
uncomely
or
poor
that
delicate
pause
in
greek
reflexion
was
joined
by
some
supreme
good
luck
to
the
perfect
animal
nature
of
the
greeks
here
are
the
two
conditions
of
an
artistic
ideal
the
influences
which
perfected
the
animal
nature
of
the
greeks
are
part
of
the
process
by
which
the
ideal
was
evolved
those
mothers
who
in
the
second
part
of
faust
mould
and
remould
the
typical
forms
that
appear
in
human
history
preside
at
the
beginning
of
greek
culture
over
such
a
concourse
of
happy
physical
conditions
as
ever
generates
by
natural
laws
some
rare
type
of
intellectual
or
spiritual
life
that
delicate
air
nimbly
and
sweetly
recommending
itself
to
the
senses
the
finer
aspects
of
nature
the
finer
lime
and
clay
of
the
human
form
and
modelling
of
the
dainty
framework
of
the
human
countenance
these
are
the
good
luck
of
the
greek
when
he
enters
upon
life
beauty
becomes
a
distinction
like
genius
or
noble
place
by
no
people
says
winckelmann
has
beauty
been
so
highly
esteemed
as
by
the
greeks
the
priests
of
a
youthful
jupiter
at
aegae
of
the
ismenian
apollo
and
the
priest
who
at
tanagra
led
the
procession
of
mercury
bearing
a
lamb
upon
his
shoulders
were
always
youths
to
whom
the
prize
of
beauty
had
been
awarded
the
citizens
of
egesta
erected
a
monument
to
a
certain
philip
who
was
not
their
but
of
croton
for
his
distinguished
beauty
and
the
people
made
offerings
at
it
in
an
ancient
song
ascribed
to
simonides
or
epicharmus
of
four
wishes
the
first
was
health
the
second
beauty
and
as
beauty
was
so
longed
for
and
prized
by
the
greeks
every
beautiful
person
sought
to
become
known
to
the
whole
people
by
this
distinction
and
above
all
to
approve
himself
to
the
artists
because
they
awarded
the
prize
and
this
was
for
the
artists
an
occasion
for
having
supreme
beauty
ever
before
their
eyes
beauty
even
gave
a
right
to
fame
and
we
find
in
greek
histories
the
most
beautiful
people
distinguished
some
were
famous
for
the
beauty
of
one
single
part
of
their
form
as
demetrius
phalereus
for
his
beautiful
eyebrows
was
called
blepharos
it
seems
even
to
have
been
thought
that
the
procreation
of
beautiful
children
might
be
promoted
by
prizes
this
is
shown
by
the
existence
of
contests
for
beauty
which
in
ancient
times
were
established
by
cypselus
king
of
arcadia
by
the
river
alpheus
and
at
the
feast
of
apollo
of
philae
a
prize
was
offered
to
the
youths
for
the
deftest
kiss
this
was
decided
by
an
umpire
as
also
at
megara
by
the
grave
of
diocles
at
sparta
and
at
lesbos
in
the
temple
of
juno
and
among
the
parrhasii
there
were
contests
for
beauty
among
women
the
general
esteem
for
beauty
went
so
far
that
the
spartan
women
set
up
in
their
bedchambers
a
nireus
a
narcissus
or
a
hyacinth
that
they
might
bear
beautiful
children
so
from
a
few
stray
antiquarianisms
a
few
faces
cast
up
sharply
from
the
waves
winckelmann
as
his
manner
was
divines
the
temperament
of
the
antique
world
and
that
in
which
it
had
delight
it
has
passed
away
with
that
distant
age
and
we
may
venture
to
dwell
upon
it
what
sharpness
and
reality
it
has
is
the
sharpness
and
reality
of
suddenly
arrested
life
the
greek
system
of
gymnastics
originated
as
part
of
a
religious
ritual
the
worshipper
was
to
recommend
himself
to
the
gods
by
becoming
fleet
and
fair
white
and
red
like
them
the
beauty
of
the
palaestra
and
the
beauty
of
the
artist
workshop
reacted
on
one
another
the
youth
tried
to
rival
his
gods
and
his
increased
beauty
passed
back
into
i
take
the
gods
to
witness
i
had
rather
have
a
fair
body
than
a
king
crown
omnymi

theous
mę
helesthai
an

basileôs
archęn
anti
tou

that
is
the
form
in
which
one
age
of
the
world
chose
the
higher
a
perfect
world
if
the
gods
could
have
seemed
for
ever
only
fleet
and
fair
white
and
red
let
us
not
regret
that
this
unperplexed
youth
of
humanity
satisfied
with
the
vision
of
itself
passed
at
the
due
moment
into
a
mournful
maturity
for
already
the
deep
joy
was
in
store
for
the
spirit
of
finding
the
ideal
of
that
youth
still
red
with
life
in
the
grave
it
followed
that
the
greek
ideal
expressed
itself
in
sculpture
all
art
has
a
sensuous
element
colour
form
sound
in
poetry
a
dexterous
recalling
of
these
together
with
the
profound
joyful
sensuousness
of
motion
and
each
of
them
may
be
a
medium
for
the
ideal
it
is
partly
accident
which
in
any
individual
case
makes
the
born
artist
poet
or
painter
rather
than
sculptor
but
as
the
mind
itself
has
had
an
historical
development
one
form
of
art
by
the
very
limitations
of
its
material
may
be
more
adequate
than
another
for
the
expression
of
any
one
phase
of
that
development
different
attitudes
of
the
imagination
have
a
native
affinity
with
different
types
of
sensuous
form
so
that
they
combine
together
with
completeness
and
ease
the
arts
may
thus
be
ranged
in
a
series
which
corresponds
to
a
series
of
developments
in
the
human
mind
itself
architecture
which
begins
in
a
practical
need
can
only
express
by
vague
hint
or
symbol
the
spirit
or
mind
of
the
artist
he
closes
his
sadness
over
him
or
wanders
in
the
perplexed
intricacies
of
things
or
projects
his
purpose
from
him
and
sincere
or
bares
himself
to
the
sunlight
but
these
spiritualities
felt
rather
than
seen
can
but
lurk
about
architectural
form
as
volatile
effects
to
be
gathered
from
it
by
reflexion
their
expression
is
indeed
not
really
sensuous
at
all
as
human
form
is
not
the
subject
with
which
it
deals
architecture
is
the
mode
in
which
the
artistic
effort
centres
when
the
thoughts
of
man
concerning
himself
are
still
indistinct
when
he
is
still
little
preoccupied
with
those
harmonies
storms
victories
of
the
unseen
and
intellectual
world
which
wrought
out
into
the
bodily
form
give
it
an
interest
and
significance
communicable
to
it
alone
the
art
of
egypt
with
its
supreme
architectural
effects
is
according
to
hegel
beautiful
comparison
a
memnon
waiting
for
the
day
the
day
of
the
greek
spirit
the
humanistic
spirit
with
its
power
of
speech
again
painting
music
and
poetry
with
their
endless
power
of
complexity
are
the
special
arts
of
the
romantic
and
modern
ages
into
these
with
the
utmost
attenuation
of
detail
may
be
translated
every
delicacy
of
thought
and
feeling
incidental
to
a
consciousness
brooding
with
delight
over
itself
through
their
gradations
of
shade
their
exquisite
intervals
they
project
in
an
external
form
that
which
is
most
inward
in
passion
or
sentiment
between
architecture
and
those
romantic
arts
of
painting
music
and
poetry
comes
sculpture
which
unlike
architecture
deals
immediately
with
man
while
it
contrasts
with
the
romantic
arts
because
it
is
not
it
has
to
do
more
exclusively
than
any
other
art
with
the
human
form
itself
one
entire
medium
of
spiritual
expression
trembling
blushing
melting
into
dew
with
inward
excitement
that
spirituality
which
only
lurks
about
architecture
as
a
volatile
effect
in
sculpture
takes
up
the
whole
given
material
and
penetrates
it
with
an
imaginative
motive
and
at
first
sight
sculpture
with
its
solidity
of
form
seems
a
thing
more
real
and
full
than
the
faint
abstract
world
of
poetry
or
painting
still
the
fact
is
the
reverse
discourse
and
action
show
man
as
he
is
more
directly
than
the
play
of
the
muscles
and
the
moulding
of
the
flesh
and
over
these
poetry
has
command
painting
by
the
flushing
of
colour
in
the
face
and
dilatation
of
light
in
the
eye
music
by
its
subtle
range
of
tones
can
refine
most
delicately
upon
a
single
moment
of
passion
unravelling
its
subtlest
threads
but
why
should
sculpture
thus
limit
itself
to
pure
form
because
by
this
limitation
it
becomes
a
perfect
medium
of
expression
for
one
peculiar
motive
of
the
imaginative
intellect
it
therefore
renounces
all
those
attributes
of
its
material
which
do
not
forward
that
motive
it
has
had
indeed
from
the
beginning
an
unfixed
claim
to
colour
but
this
element
of
colour
in
it
has
always
been
more
or
less
conventional
with
no
melting
or
modulation
of
tones
never
permitting
more
than
a
very
limited
realism
it
was
maintained
chiefly
as
a
religious
tradition
in
proportion
as
the
art
of
sculpture
ceased
to
be
merely
decorative
and
subordinate
to
architecture
it
threw
itself
upon
pure
form
it
renounces
the
power
of
expression
by
lower
or
heightened
tones
in
it
no
member
of
the
human
form
is
more
significant
than
the
rest
the
eye
is
wide
and
without
pupil
the
lips
and
brow
are
hardly
less
significant
than
hands
and
breasts
and
feet
but
the
limitation
of
its
resources
is
part
of
its
pride
it
has
no
backgrounds
no
sky
or
atmosphere
to
suggest
and
interpret
a
train
of
feeling
a
little
of
suggested
motion
and
much
of
pure
light
on
its
gleaming
surfaces
with
pure
form
only
these
and
it
gains
more
than
it
loses
by
this
limitation
to
its
own
distinguishing
motives
it
unveils
man
in
the
repose
of
his
unchanging
characteristics
that
white
light
purged
from
the
angry
stains
of
action
and
passion
reveals
not
what
is
accidental
in
man
but
the
tranquil
godship
in
him
as
opposed
to
the
restless
accidents
of
life
the
art
of
sculpture
records
the
first
naďve
unperplexed
recognition
of
man
by
himself
and
it
is
a
proof
of
the
high
artistic
capacity
of
the
greeks
that
they
apprehended
and
remained
true
to
these
exquisite
limitations
yet
in
spite
of
them
gave
to
their
creations
a
mobile
a
vital
individuality
heiterkeit
blitheness
or
repose
and
allgemeinheit
generality
or
breadth
are
then
the
supreme
characteristics
of
the
hellenic
ideal
but
that
generality
or
breadth
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
lax
observation
the
unlearned
thought
the
flaccid
execution
which
have
sometimes
claimed
superiority
in
art
on
the
plea
of
being
broad
or
general
hellenic
breadth
and
generality
come
of
a
culture
minute
severe
constantly
renewed
rectifying
and
concentrating
its
impressions
into
certain
pregnant
types
the
basis
of
all
artistic
genius
lies
in
the
power
of
conceiving
humanity
in
a
new
and
striking
way
of
putting
a
happy
world
of
its
own
creation
in
place
of
the
meaner
world
of
our
common
days
generating
around
itself
an
atmosphere
with
a
novel
power
of
refraction
selecting
transforming
recombining
the
images
it
transmits
according
to
the
choice
of
the
imaginative
intellect
in
exercising
this
power
painting
and
poetry
have
a
variety
of
subject
almost
unlimited
the
range
of
characters
or
persons
open
to
them
is
as
various
as
life
itself
no
character
however
trivial
misshapen
or
unlovely
can
resist
their
magic
that
is
because
those
arts
can
accomplish
their
function
in
the
choice
and
development
of
some
special
situation
which
lifts
or
glorifies
a
character
in
itself
not
poetical
to
realise
this
situation
to
define
in
a
chill
and
empty
atmosphere
the
focus
where
rays
in
themselves
pale
and
impotent
unite
and
begin
to
burn
the
artist
may
have
indeed
to
employ
the
most
cunning
detail
to
complicate
and
refine
upon
thought
and
passion
a
let
us
take
a
brilliant
example
from
the
poems
of
robert
browning
his
poetry
is
the
poetry
of
situations
the
characters
themselves
are
always
of
secondary
importance
often
they
are
characters
in
themselves
of
little
interest
they
seem
to
come
to
him
by
strange
accidents
from
the
ends
of
the
world
his
gift
is
shown
by
the
way
in
which
he
accepts
such
a
character
throws
it
into
some
situation
or
apprehends
it
in
some
delicate
pause
of
life
in
which
for
a
moment
it
becomes
ideal
in
the
poem
entitled
le
byron
de
nos
jours
in
his
dramatis
personae
we
have
a
single
moment
of
passion
thrown
into
relief
after
this
exquisite
fashion
those
two
jaded
parisians
are
not
intrinsically
interesting
they
begin
to
interest
us
only
when
thrown
into
a
choice
situation
but
to
discriminate
that
moment
to
make
it
appreciable
by
us
that
we
may
find
it
what
a
cobweb
of
allusions
what
double
and
treble
reflexions
of
the
mind
upon
itself
what
an
artificial
light
is
constructed
and
broken
over
the
chosen
situation
on
how
fine
a
needle
point
that
little
world
of
passion
is
balanced
yet
in
spite
of
this
intricacy
the
poem
has
the
clear
ring
of
a
central
motive
we
receive
from
it
the
impression
of
one
imaginative
tone
of
a
single
creative
act
to
produce
such
effects
at
all
requires
all
the
resources
of
painting
with
its
power
of
indirect
expression
of
subordinate
but
significant
detail
its
atmosphere
its
foregrounds
and
backgrounds
to
produce
them
in
a
degree
requires
all
the
resources
of
poetry
language
in
its
most
purged
form
its
remote
associations
and
suggestions
its
double
and
treble
lights
these
appliances
sculpture
can
not
command
in
it
therefore
not
the
special
situation
but
the
type
the
general
character
of
the
subject
to
be
delineated
is
in
poetry
and
painting
the
situation
predominates
over
the
character
in
sculpture
the
character
over
the
situation
excluded
by
the
proper
limitation
of
its
material
from
the
development
of
exquisite
situations
it
has
to
choose
from
a
select
number
of
types
intrinsically
interesting
interesting
that
is
independently
of
any
special
situation
into
which
they
may
be
thrown
sculpture
finds
the
secret
of
its
power
in
presenting
these
types
in
their
broad
central
incisive
lines
this
it
effects
not
by
accumulation
of
detail
but
by
abstracting
from
it
all
that
is
accidental
all
that
distracts
the
simple
effect
upon
us
of
the
supreme
types
of
humanity
all
traces
in
them
of
the
commonness
of
the
world
it
gradually
purges
away
works
of
art
produced
under
this
law
and
only
these
are
really
characterised
by
hellenic
generality
or
breadth
in
every
direction
it
is
a
law
of
restraint
it
keeps
passion
always
below
that
degree
of
intensity
at
which
it
must
necessarily
be
transitory
never
winding
up
the
features
to
one
note
of
anger
or
desire
or
surprise
in
some
of
the
feebler
allegorical
designs
of
the
middle
age
we
find
isolated
qualities
portrayed
as
by
so
many
masks
its
religious
art
has
familiarised
us
with
faces
fixed
immovably
into
blank
types
of
placid
reverie
men
and
women
again
in
the
hurry
of
life
often
wear
the
sharp
impress
of
one
absorbing
motive
from
which
it
is
said
death
sets
their
features
free
all
such
instances
may
be
ranged
under
the
grotesque
and
the
hellenic
ideal
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
grotesque
it
allows
passion
to
play
lightly
over
the
surface
of
the
individual
form
losing
thereby
nothing
of
its
central
impassivity
its
depth
and
repose
to
all
but
the
highest
culture
the
reserved
faces
of
the
gods
will
ever
have
something
of
insipidity
again
in
the
best
greek
sculpture
the
archaic
immobility
has
been
stirred
its
forms
are
in
motion
but
it
is
a
motion
ever
kept
in
reserve
and
very
seldom
committed
to
any
definite
action
endless
as
are
the
attitudes
of
greek
sculpture
exquisite
as
is
the
invention
of
the
greeks
in
this
direction
the
actions
or
situations
it
permits
are
simple
and
few
there
is
no
greek
madonna
the
goddesses
are
always
childless
the
actions
selected
are
those
which
would
be
without
significance
except
in
a
divine
person
binding
on
a
sandal
or
preparing
for
the
bath
when
a
more
complex
and
significant
action
is
permitted
it
is
most
often
represented
as
just
finished
so
that
eager
expectancy
is
excluded
as
in
the
image
of
apollo
just
after
the
slaughter
of
the
python
or
of
venus
with
the
apple
of
paris
already
in
her
hand
the
laocoon
with
all
that
patient
science
through
which
it
has
triumphed
over
an
almost
unmanageable
subject
marks
a
period
in
which
sculpture
has
begun
to
aim
at
effects
legitimate
because
delightful
only
in
painting
the
hair
so
rich
a
source
of
expression
in
painting
because
relatively
to
the
eye
or
the
lip
it
is
mere
drapery
is
withdrawn
from
attention
its
texture
as
well
as
its
colour
is
lost
its
arrangement
but
faintly
and
severely
indicated
with
no
broken
or
enmeshed
light
the
eyes
are
wide
and
directionless
not
fixing
anything
with
their
gaze
nor
riveting
the
brain
to
any
special
external
object
the
brows
without
hair
again
greek
sculpture
deals
almost
exclusively
with
youth
where
the
moulding
of
the
bodily
organs
is
still
as
if
suspended
between
growth
and
completion
indicated
but
not
emphasised
where
the
transition
from
curve
to
curve
is
so
delicate
and
elusive
that
winckelmann
compares
it
to
a
quiet
sea
which
although
we
understand
it
to
be
in
motion
we
nevertheless
regard
as
an
image
of
repose
where
therefore
the
exact
degree
of
development
is
so
hard
to
apprehend
if
a
single
product
only
of
hellenic
art
were
to
be
saved
in
the
wreck
of
all
beside
one
might
choose
perhaps
from
the
beautiful
multitude
of
the
panathenaic
frieze
that
line
of
youths
on
horseback
with
their
level
glances
their
proud
patient
lips
their
chastened
reins
their
whole
bodies
in
exquisite
service
this
colourless
unclassified
purity
of
life
with
its
blending
and
interpenetration
of
intellectual
spiritual
and
physical
elements
still
folded
together
pregnant
with
the
possibilities
of
a
whole
world
closed
within
it
is
the
highest
expression
of
the
indifference
which
lies
beyond
all
that
is
relative
or
partial
everywhere
there
is
the
effect
of
an
awaking
of
a
child
sleep
just
disturbed
all
these
effects
are
united
in
a
single
instance
the
adorante
of
the
museum
of
berlin
a
youth
who
has
gained
the
wrestler
prize
with
hands
lifted
and
open
in
praise
for
the
victory
fresh
unperplexed
it
is
the
image
of
a
man
as
he
springs
first
from
the
sleep
of
nature
his
white
light
taking
no
colour
from
any
experience
he
is
characterless
so
far
as
character
involves
subjection
to
the
accidental
influences
of
life
this
sense
says
hegel
for
the
consummate
modelling
of
divine
and
human
forms
was
at
home
in
greece
in
its
poets
and
orators
its
historians
and
philosophers
greece
can
not
be
conceived
from
a
central
point
unless
one
brings
as
a
key
to
the
understanding
of
it
an
insight
into
the
ideal
forms
of
sculpture
and
regards
the
images
of
statesmen
and
philosophers
as
well
as
epic
and
dramatic
heroes
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
for
those
who
act
as
well
as
those
who
create
and
think
have
in
those
beautiful
days
of
greece
this
plastic
character
they
are
great
and
free
and
have
grown
up
on
the
soil
of
their
own
individuality
creating
themselves
out
of
themselves
and
moulding
themselves
to
what
they
were
and
willed
to
be
the
age
of
pericles
was
rich
in
such
characters
pericles
himself
pheidias
plato
above
all
sophocles
thucydides
also
xenophon
and
socrates
each
in
his
own
order
the
perfection
of
one
remaining
undiminished
by
that
of
the
others
they
are
ideal
artists
of
themselves
cast
each
in
one
flawless
mould
works
of
art
which
stand
before
us
as
an
immortal
presentment
of
the
gods
of
this
modelling
also
are
those
bodily
works
of
art
the
victors
in
the
olympic
games
yes
and
even
phryne
who
as
the
most
beautiful
of
women
ascended
naked
out
of
the
water
in
the
presence
of
assembled
greece
this
key
to
the
understanding
of
the
greek
spirit
winckelmann
possessed
in
his
own
nature
itself
like
a
relic
of
classical
antiquity
laid
open
by
accident
to
our
alien
modern
atmosphere
to
the
criticism
of
that
consummate
greek
modelling
he
brought
not
only
his
culture
but
his
temperament
we
have
seen
how
definite
was
the
leading
motive
of
that
culture
how
like
some
central
it
maintained
the
unity
of
his
life
through
a
thousand
distractions
interests
not
his
nor
meant
for
him
never
disturbed
him
in
morals
as
in
criticism
he
followed
the
clue
of
instinct
of
an
unerring
instinct
penetrating
into
the
antique
world
by
his
passion
his
temperament
he
enunciated
no
formal
principles
always
hard
and
minute
and
anxious
as
his
culture
was
he
never
became
analytical
occupied
ever
with
himself
perfecting
himself
and
developing
his
genius
he
was
not
content
as
so
often
happens
with
such
natures
that
the
atmosphere
between
him
and
other
minds
should
be
thick
and
clouded
he
was
ever
jealously
refining
his
meaning
into
a
form
express
clear
objective
this
temperament
he
nurtured
and
invigorated
by
friendships
which
kept
him
always
in
direct
contact
with
the
spirit
of
youth
the
beauty
of
the
greek
statues
was
a
sexless
beauty
the
statues
of
the
gods
had
the
least
traces
of
sex
here
there
is
a
moral
sexlessness
a
kind
of
ineffectual
wholeness
of
nature
yet
with
a
true
beauty
and
significance
of
its
own
one
result
of
this
temperament
is
a
serenity
heiterkeit
which
characterises
winckelmann
handling
of
the
sensuous
side
of
greek
art
this
serenity
is
perhaps
in
great
measure
a
negative
quality
it
is
the
absence
of
any
sense
of
want
or
corruption
or
shame
with
the
sensuous
element
in
greek
art
he
deals
in
the
pagan
manner
and
what
is
implied
in
that
it
has
been
sometimes
said
that
art
is
a
means
of
escape
from
the
tyranny
of
the
senses
it
may
be
so
for
the
spectator
he
may
find
that
the
spectacle
of
supreme
works
of
art
takes
from
the
life
of
the
senses
something
of
its
turbid
fever
but
this
is
possible
for
the
spectator
only
because
the
artist
in
producing
those
works
has
gradually
sunk
his
intellectual
and
spiritual
ideas
in
sensuous
form
he
may
live
as
keats
lived
a
pure
life
but
his
soul
like
that
of
plato
false
astronomer
becomes
more
and
more
immersed
in
sense
until
nothing
which
lacks
the
appeal
to
sense
has
interest
for
him
how
could
such
an
one
ever
again
endure
the
greyness
of
the
ideal
or
spiritual
world
the
spiritualist
is
satisfied
as
he
watches
the
escape
of
the
sensuous
elements
from
his
conceptions
his
interest
grows
as
the
dyed
garment
bleaches
in
the
keener
air
but
the
artist
steeps
his
thought
again
and
again
into
the
fire
of
colour
to
the
greek
this
immersion
in
the
sensuous
was
religiously
at
least
indifferent
greek
sensuousness
therefore
does
not
fever
the
conscience
it
is
shameless
and
childlike
christian
asceticism
on
the
other
hand
discrediting
the
slightest
touch
of
sense
has
from
time
to
time
provoked
into
strong
emphasis
the
contrast
or
antagonism
to
itself
of
the
artistic
life
with
its
inevitable
i
did
but
taste
a
little
honey
with
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
mine
hand
and
lo
i
must
it
has
sometimes
seemed
hard
to
pursue
that
life
without
something
of
conscious
disavowal
of
a
spiritual
world
and
this
imparts
to
genuine
artistic
interests
a
kind
of
intoxication
from
this
intoxication
winckelmann
is
free
he
fingers
those
pagan
marbles
with
unsinged
hands
with
no
sense
of
shame
or
loss
that
is
to
deal
with
the
sensuous
side
of
art
in
the
pagan
manner
the
longer
we
contemplate
that
hellenic
ideal
in
which
man
is
at
unity
with
himself
with
his
physical
nature
with
the
outward
world
the
more
we
may
be
inclined
to
regret
that
he
should
ever
have
passed
beyond
it
to
contend
for
a
perfection
that
makes
the
blood
turbid
and
frets
the
flesh
and
discredits
the
actual
world
about
us
but
if
he
was
to
be
saved
from
the
ennui
which
ever
attaches
itself
to
realisation
even
the
realisation
of
the
perfect
life
it
was
necessary
that
a
conflict
should
come
that
some
sharper
note
should
grieve
the
existing
harmony
and
the
spirit
chafed
by
it
beat
out
at
last
only
a
larger
and
profounder
music
in
greek
tragedy
this
conflict
has
begun
man
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
rival
claims
greek
tragedy
shows
how
such
a
conflict
may
be
treated
with
serenity
how
the
evolution
of
it
may
be
a
spectacle
of
the
dignity
not
of
the
impotence
of
the
human
spirit
but
it
is
not
only
in
tragedy
that
the
greek
spirit
showed
itself
capable
of
thus
bringing
joy
out
of
matter
in
itself
full
of
discouragements
theocritus
too
strikes
often
a
note
of
romantic
sadness
but
what
a
blithe
and
steady
poise
above
these
discouragements
in
a
clear
and
sunny
stratum
of
the
air
into
this
stage
of
greek
achievement
winckelmann
did
not
enter
supreme
as
he
is
where
his
true
interest
lay
his
insight
into
the
typical
unity
and
repose
of
the
highest
sort
of
sculpture
seems
to
have
involved
limitation
in
another
direction
his
conception
of
art
excludes
that
bolder
type
of
it
which
deals
confidently
and
serenely
with
life
conflict
evil
living
in
a
world
of
exquisite
but
abstract
and
colourless
form
he
could
hardly
have
conceived
of
the
subtle
and
penetrative
yet
somewhat
grotesque
art
of
the
modern
world
what
would
he
have
thought
of
gilliatt
in
victor
hugo
travailleurs
de
la
mer
or
of
the
bleeding
mouth
of
fantine
in
the
first
part
of
les
misérables
penetrated
as
those
books
are
with
a
sense
of
beauty
as
lively
and
transparent
as
that
of
a
greek
nay
a
sort
of
preparation
for
the
romantic
temper
is
noticeable
even
within
the
limits
of
the
greek
ideal
itself
which
for
his
part
winckelmann
failed
to
see
for
greek
religion
has
not
merely
its
mournful
mysteries
of
adonis
of
hyacinthus
of
demeter
but
it
is
conscious
also
of
the
fall
of
earlier
divine
dynasties
hyperion
gives
way
to
apollo
oceanus
to
poseidon
around
the
feet
of
that
tranquil
olympian
family
still
crowd
the
weary
shadows
of
an
earlier
more
formless
divine
world
the
placid
minds
even
of
olympian
gods
are
troubled
with
thoughts
of
a
limit
to
duration
of
inevitable
decay
of
dispossession
again
the
supreme
and
colourless
abstraction
of
those
divine
forms
which
is
the
secret
of
their
repose
is
also
a
premonition
of
the
fleshless
consumptive
refinements
of
the
pale
medieval
artists
that
high
indifference
to
the
outward
that
impassivity
has
already
a
touch
of
the
corpse
in
it
we
see
already
angelico
and
the
master
of
the
passion
in
the
artistic
future
the
suppression
of
the
sensuous
the
shutting
of
the
door
upon
it
the
ascetic
interest
may
be
even
now
foreseen
those
abstracted
gods
ready
to
melt
out
their
essence
fine
into
the
winds
who
can
fold
up
their
flesh
as
a
garment
and
still
remain
themselves
seem
already
to
feel
that
bleak
air
in
which
like
helen
of
troy
they
wander
as
the
spectres
of
the
middle
age
gradually
as
the
world
came
into
the
church
an
artistic
interest
native
in
the
human
soul
reasserted
its
claims
but
christian
art
was
still
dependent
on
pagan
examples
building
the
shafts
of
pagan
temples
into
its
churches
perpetuating
the
form
of
the
basilica
in
later
times
working
the
disused
amphitheatres
as
stone
quarries
the
sensuous
expression
of
ideas
which
unreservedly
discredit
the
world
of
sense
was
the
delicate
problem
which
christian
art
had
before
it
if
we
think
of
medieval
painting
as
it
ranges
from
the
early
german
schools
still
with
something
of
the
air
of
the
about
them
to
the
clear
loveliness
of
perugino
we
shall
see
how
that
problem
was
solved
in
the
very
worship
of
sorrow
the
native
blitheness
of
art
asserted
itself
the
religious
spirit
as
hegel
says
smiled
through
its
tears
so
perfectly
did
the
young
raphael
infuse
that
heiterkeit
that
pagan
blitheness
into
religious
works
that
his
picture
of
saint
agatha
at
bologna
became
to
goethe
a
step
in
the
evolution
of
iphigenie
but
in
proportion
as
the
gift
of
smiling
was
found
once
more
there
came
also
an
aspiration
towards
that
lost
antique
art
some
relics
of
which
christian
art
had
buried
in
itself
ready
to
work
wonders
when
their
day
came
the
history
of
art
has
suffered
as
much
as
any
history
by
trenchant
and
absolute
divisions
pagan
and
christian
art
are
sometimes
harshly
opposed
and
the
renaissance
is
represented
as
a
fashion
which
set
in
at
a
definite
period
that
is
the
superficial
view
the
deeper
view
is
that
which
preserves
the
identity
of
european
culture
the
two
are
really
continuous
and
there
is
a
sense
in
which
it
may
be
said
that
the
renaissance
was
an
uninterrupted
effort
of
the
middle
age
that
it
was
ever
taking
place
when
the
actual
relics
of
the
antique
were
restored
to
the
world
in
the
view
of
the
christian
ascetic
it
was
as
if
an
ancient
had
been
opened
all
the
world
took
the
contagion
of
the
life
of
nature
and
of
the
senses
and
now
it
was
seen
that
the
medieval
spirit
too
had
done
something
for
the
new
fortunes
of
the
antique
by
hastening
the
decline
of
art
by
withdrawing
interest
from
it
and
yet
keeping
unbroken
the
thread
of
its
traditions
it
had
suffered
the
human
mind
to
repose
itself
that
when
day
came
it
might
awake
with
eyes
refreshed
to
those
ancient
ideal
forms
the
aim
of
a
right
criticism
is
to
place
winckelmann
in
an
intellectual
perspective
of
which
goethe
is
the
foreground
for
after
all
he
is
infinitely
less
than
goethe
and
it
is
chiefly
because
at
certain
points
he
comes
in
contact
with
goethe
that
criticism
entertains
consideration
of
him
his
relation
to
modern
culture
is
a
peculiar
one
he
is
not
of
the
modern
world
nor
is
he
wholly
of
the
eighteenth
century
although
so
much
of
his
outer
life
is
characteristic
of
it
but
that
note
of
revolt
against
the
eighteenth
century
which
we
detect
in
goethe
was
struck
by
winckelmann
goethe
illustrates
a
union
of
the
romantic
spirit
in
its
adventure
its
variety
its
profound
subjectivity
of
soul
with
hellenism
in
its
transparency
its
rationality
its
desire
of
beauty
that
marriage
of
faust
and
helena
of
which
the
art
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
the
child
the
beautiful
lad
euphorion
as
goethe
conceives
him
on
the
crags
in
the
splendour
of
battle
and
in
harness
as
for
victory
his
brows
bound
with
light
goethe
illustrates
too
the
preponderance
in
this
marriage
of
the
hellenic
element
and
that
element
in
its
true
essence
was
made
known
to
him
by
winckelmann
breadth
centrality
with
blitheness
and
repose
are
the
marks
of
hellenic
culture
is
such
culture
a
lost
art
the
local
accidental
colouring
of
its
own
age
has
passed
from
it
and
the
greatness
that
is
dead
looks
greater
when
every
link
with
what
is
slight
and
vulgar
has
been
severed
we
can
only
see
it
at
all
in
the
reflected
refined
light
which
a
great
education
creates
for
us
can
we
bring
down
that
ideal
into
the
gaudy
perplexed
light
of
modern
life
certainly
for
us
of
the
modern
world
with
its
conflicting
claims
its
entangled
interests
distracted
by
so
many
sorrows
with
many
preoccupations
so
bewildering
an
experience
the
problem
of
unity
with
ourselves
in
blitheness
and
repose
is
far
harder
than
it
was
for
the
greek
within
the
simple
terms
of
antique
life
yet
not
less
than
ever
the
intellect
demands
completeness
centrality
it
is
this
which
winckelmann
imprints
on
the
imagination
of
goethe
at
the
beginning
of
life
in
its
original
and
simplest
form
as
in
a
fragment
of
greek
art
itself
stranded
on
that
littered
indeterminate
shore
of
germany
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
winckelmann
this
type
comes
to
him
not
as
in
a
book
or
a
theory
but
more
importunately
because
in
a
passionate
life
in
a
personality
for
goethe
possessing
all
modern
interests
ready
to
be
lost
in
the
perplexed
currents
of
modern
thought
he
defines
in
clearest
outline
the
eternal
problem
of
culture
balance
unity
with
one
self
consummate
greek
modelling
it
could
no
longer
be
solved
as
in
phryne
ascending
naked
out
of
the
water
by
perfection
of
bodily
form
or
any
joyful
union
with
the
external
world
the
shadows
had
grown
too
long
the
light
too
solemn
for
that
it
could
hardly
be
solved
as
in
pericles
or
pheidias
by
the
direct
exercise
of
any
single
talent
amid
the
manifold
claims
of
our
modern
intellectual
life
that
could
only
have
ended
in
a
thin
growth
goethe
hellenism
was
of
another
order
the
allgemeinheit
and
heiterkeit
the
completeness
and
serenity
of
a
watchful
exigent
intellectualism
im

is
description
of
his
own
higher
life
and
what
is
meant
by
life
in
the
whole
im
ganzen
it
means
the
life
of
one
for
whom
over
and
over
again
what
was
once
precious
has
become
indifferent
every
one
who
aims
at
the
life
of
culture
is
met
by
many
forms
of
it
arising
out
of
the
intense
laborious
development
of
some
special
talent
they
are
the
brightest
enthusiasms
the
world
has
to
show
and
it
is
not
their
part
to
weigh
the
claims
which
this
or
that
alien
form
of
genius
makes
upon
them
but
the
proper
instinct
of
cares
not
so
much
to
reap
all
that
those
various
forms
of
genius
can
give
as
to
find
in
them
its
own
strength
the
demand
of
the
intellect
is
to
feel
itself
alive
it
must
see
into
the
laws
the
operation
the
intellectual
reward
of
every
divided
form
of
culture
but
only
that
it
may
measure
the
relation
between
itself
and
them
it
struggles
with
those
forms
till
its
secret
is
won
from
each
and
then
lets
each
fall
back
into
its
place
in
the
supreme
artistic
view
of
life
with
a
kind
of
passionate
coldness
such
natures
rejoice
to
be
away
from
and
past
their
former
selves
and
above
all
they
are
jealous
of
that
abandonment
to
one
special
gift
which
really
limits
their
capabilities
it
would
have
been
easy
for
goethe
with
the
gift
of
a
sensuous
nature
to
let
it
overgrow
him
it
comes
easily
and
naturally
perhaps
to
certain
natures
to
be
even
as
the
schöne
seele
that
ideal
of
gentle
pietism
in
wilhelm
meister
but
to
the
large
vision
of
goethe
this
seemed
to
be
a
phase
of
life
that
a
man
might
feel
all
round
and
leave
behind
him
again
it
is
easy
to
indulge
the
commonplace
metaphysical
instinct
but
a
taste
for
metaphysics
may
be
one
of
those
things
which
we
must
renounce
if
we
mean
to
mould
our
lives
to
artistic
perfection
philosophy
serves
culture
not
by
the
fancied
gift
of
absolute
or
transcendental
knowledge
but
by
suggesting
questions
which
help
one
to
detect
the
passion
and
strangeness
and
dramatic
contrasts
of
life
but
goethe
culture
did
not
remain
behind
the
veil
it
ever
emerged
in
the
practical
functions
of
art
in
actual
production
for
him
the
problem
came
to
be
can
the
blitheness
and
universality
of
the
antique
ideal
be
communicated
to
artistic
productions
which
shall
contain
the
fulness
of
the
experience
of
the
modern
world
we
have
seen
that
the
development
of
the
various
forms
of
art
has
corresponded
to
the
development
of
the
thoughts
of
man
concerning
humanity
to
the
growing
revelation
of
the
mind
to
itself
sculpture
corresponds
to
the
unperplexed
emphatic
outlines
of
hellenic
humanism
painting
to
the
mystic
depth
and
intricacy
of
the
middle
age
music
and
poetry
have
their
fortune
in
the
modern
world
let
us
understand
by
poetry
all
literary
production
which
attains
the
power
of
giving
pleasure
by
its
form
as
distinct
from
its
matter
only
in
this
varied
literary
form
can
art
command
that
width
variety
delicacy
of
resources
which
will
enable
it
to
deal
with
the
conditions
of
modern
life
what
modern
art
has
to
do
in
the
service
of
culture
is
so
to
rearrange
the
details
of
modern
life
so
to
reflect
it
that
it
may
satisfy
the
spirit
and
what
does
the
spirit
need
in
the
face
of
modern
life
the
sense
of
freedom
that
naďve
rough
sense
of
freedom
which
supposes
man
will
to
be
limited
if
at
all
only
by
a
will
stronger
than
his
he
can
never
have
again
the
attempt
to
represent
it
in
art
would
have
so
little
verisimilitude
that
it
would
be
flat
and
uninteresting
the
chief
factor
in
the
thoughts
of
the
modern
mind
concerning
itself
is
the
intricacy
the
universality
of
natural
law
even
in
the
moral
order
for
us
necessity
is
not
as
of
old
a
sort
of
mythological
personage
without
us
with
whom
we
can
do
warfare
it
is
rather
a
magic
web
woven
through
and
through
us
like
that
magnetic
system
of
which
modern
science
speaks
penetrating
us
with
a
network
subtler
than
our
subtlest
nerves
yet
bearing
in
it
the
central
forces
of
the
world
can
art
represent
men
and
women
in
these
bewildering
toils
so
as
to
give
the
spirit
at
least
an
equivalent
for
the
sense
of
freedom
certainly
in
romances
and
even
more
in
the
romances
of
victor
hugo
we
have
high
examples
of
modern
art
dealing
thus
with
modern
life
regarding
that
life
as
the
modern
mind
must
regard
it
yet
reflecting
upon
it
blitheness
and
repose
natural
laws
we
shall
never
modify
embarrass
us
as
they
may
but
there
is
still
something
in
the
nobler
or
less
noble
attitude
with
which
we
watch
their
fatal
combinations
in
those
romances
of
goethe
and
victor
hugo
in
some
excellent
work
done
after
them
this
entanglement
this
network
of
law
becomes
the
tragic
situation
in
which
certain
groups
of
noble
men
and
women
work
out
for
themselves
a
supreme
dénouement
who
if
he
saw
through
all
would
fret
against
the

has
more

more
become
the
tendency
of
modern
thought
let
us
begin
with
that
which
is
without
our
physical
life
fix
upon
it
in
one
of
its
more
exquisite
intervals
the
moment
for
instance
of
delicious
recoil
from
the
flood
of
water
in
summer
heat
what
is
the
whole
physical
life
in
that
moment
but
a
combination
of
natural
elements
to
which
science
gives
their
names
but
those
elements
phosphorus
and
lime
and
delicate
fibres
are
present
not
in
the
human
body
alone
we
detect
them
in
places
most
remote
from
it
our
physical
life
is
a
perpetual
motion
of
them
the
passage
of
the
blood
the
waste
and
repairing
of
the
lenses
of
the
eye
the
modification
of
the
tissues
of
the
brain
under
every
ray
of
light
and
sound
processes
which
science
reduces
to
simpler
and
more
elementary
forces
like
the
elements
of
which
we
are
composed
the
action
of
these
forces
extends
beyond
us
it
rusts
iron
and
ripens
corn
far
out
on
every
side
of
us
those
elements
are
broadcast
driven
in
many
currents
and
birth
and
gesture
and
death
and
the
springing
of
violets
from
the
grave
are
but
a
few
out
of
ten
thousand
resultant
combinations
that
clear
perpetual
outline
of
face
and
limb
is
but
an
image
of
ours
under
which
we
group
them
a
design
in
a
web
the
actual
threads
of
which
pass
out
beyond
it
this
at
least
of
flamelike
our
life
has
that
it
is
but
the
concurrence
renewed
from
moment
to
moment
of
forces
parting
sooner
or
later
on
their
ways
or
if
we
begin
with
the
inward
world
of
thought
and
feeling
the
whirlpool
is
still
more
rapid
the
flame
more
eager
and
devouring
there
it
is
no
longer
the
gradual
darkening
of
the
eye
the
gradual
fading
of
colour
from
the
wall
movements
of
the
where
the
water
flows
down
indeed
though
in
apparent
rest
but
the
race
of
the
a
drift
of
momentary
acts
of
sight
and
passion
and
thought
at
first
sight
experience
seems
to
bury
us
under
a
flood
of
external
objects
pressing
upon
us
with
a
sharp
and
importunate
reality
calling
us
out
of
ourselves
in
a
thousand
forms
of
action
but
when
reflexion
begins
to
play
upon
these
objects
they
are
dissipated
under
its
influence
the
cohesive
force
seems
suspended
like
some
trick
of
magic
each
object
is
loosed
into
a
group
of
impressions
colour
odour
texture
in
the
mind
of
the
observer
and
if
we
continue
to
dwell
in
thought
on
this
world
not
of
objects
in
the
solidity
with
which
language
invests
them
but
of
impressions
unstable
flickering
inconsistent
which
burn
and
are
extinguished
with
our
consciousness
of
them
it
contracts
still
further
the
whole
scope
of
observation
is
dwarfed
into
the
narrow
chamber
of
the
individual
mind
experience
already
reduced
to
a
group
of
impressions
is
ringed
round
for
each
one
of
us
by
that
thick
wall
of
personality
through
which
no
real
voice
has
ever
pierced
on
its
way
to
us
or
from
us
to
that
which
we
can
only
conjecture
to
be
without
every
one
of
those
impressions
is
the
impression
of
the
individual
in
his
isolation
each
mind
keeping
as
a
solitary
prisoner
its
own
dream
of
a
world
analysis
goes
a
step
farther
still
and
assures
us
that
those
impressions
of
the
individual
mind
to
which
for
each
one
of
us
experience
dwindles
down
are
in
perpetual
flight
that
each
of
them
is
limited
by
time
and
that
as
time
is
infinitely
divisible
each
of
them
is
infinitely
divisible
also
all
that
is
actual
in
it
being
a
single
moment
gone
while
we
try
to
apprehend
it
of
which
it
may
ever
be
more
truly
said
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
than
that
it
is
to
such
a
tremulous
wisp
constantly
itself
on
the
stream
to
a
single
sharp
impression
with
a
sense
in
it
a
relic
more
or
less
fleeting
of
such
moments
gone
by
what
is
real
in
our
life
fines
itself
down
it
is
with
this
movement
with
the
passage
and
dissolution
of
impressions
images
sensations
that
analysis
leaves
off
that
continual
vanishing
away
that
strange
perpetual
weaving
and
unweaving
of
ourselves
philosophiren
says
novalis
ist
dephlegmatisiren
the
service
of
philosophy
of
speculative
culture
towards
the
human
spirit
is
to
rouse
to
startle
it
to
a
life
of
constant
and
eager
observation
every
moment
some
form
grows
perfect
in
hand
or
face
some
tone
on
the
hills
or
the
sea
is
choicer
than
the
rest
some
mood
of
passion
or
insight
or
intellectual
excitement
is
irresistibly
real
and
attractive
to
us
for
that
moment
only
not
the
fruit
of
experience
but
experience
itself
is
the
end
a
counted
number
of
pulses
only
is
given
to
us
of
a
variegated
dramatic
life
how
may
we
see
in
them
all
that
is
to
seen
in
them
by
the
finest
senses
how
shall
we
pass
most
swiftly
from
point
to
point
and
be
present
always
at
the
focus
where
the
greatest
number
of
vital
forces
unite
in
their
purest
energy
to
burn
always
with
this
hard
gemlike
flame
to
maintain
this
ecstasy
is
success
in
life
in
a
sense
it
might
even
be
said
that
our
failure
is
to
form
habits
for
after
all
habit
is
relative
to
a
stereotyped
world
and
meantime
it
is
only
the
roughness
of
the
eye
that
makes
any
two
persons
things
situations
seem
alike
while
all
melts
under
our
feet
we
may
well
grasp
at
any
exquisite
passion
or
any
contribution
to
knowledge
that
seems
by
a
lifted
horizon
to
set
the
spirit
free
for
a
moment
or
any
stirring
of
the
senses
strange
dyes
strange
colours
and
curious
odours
or
work
of
the
artist
hands
or
the
face
of
one
friend
not
to
discriminate
every
moment
some
passionate
attitude
in
those
about
us
and
in
the
very
brilliancy
of
their
gifts
some
tragic
dividing
of
forces
on
their
ways
is
on
this
short
day
of
frost
and
sun
to
sleep
before
evening
with
this
sense
of
the
splendour
of
our
experience
and
of
its
awful
brevity
gathering
all
we
are
into
one
desperate
effort
to
see
and
touch
we
shall
hardly
have
time
to
make
theories
about
the
things
we
see
and
touch
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
be
for
ever
curiously
testing
new
opinions
and
courting
new
impressions
never
acquiescing
in
a
facile
orthodoxy
of
comte
or
of
hegel
or
of
our
own
philosophical
theories
or
ideas
as
points
of
view
instruments
of
criticism
may
help
us
to
gather
up
what
might
otherwise
pass
unregarded
by
us
philosophy
is
the
microscope
of
thought
the
theory
or
idea
or
system
which
requires
of
us
the
sacrifice
of
any
part
of
this
experience
in
consideration
of
some
interest
into
which
we
can
not
enter
or
some
abstract
theory
we
have
not
identified
with
ourselves
or
of
what
is
only
conventional
has
no
real
claim
upon
us
one
of
the
most
beautiful
passages
of
rousseau
is
that
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
confessions
where
he
describes
the
awakening
in
him
of
the
literary
sense
an
undefinable
taint
of
death
had
clung
always
about
him
and
now
in
early
manhood
he
believed
himself
smitten
by
mortal
disease
he
asked
himself
how
he
might
make
as
much
as
possible
of
the
interval
that
remained
and
he
was
not
biassed
by
anything
in
his
previous
life
when
he
decided
that
it
must
be
by
intellectual
excitement
which
he
found
just
then
in
the
clear
fresh
writings
of
voltaire
well
we
are
all
condamnés
as
victor
hugo
says
we
are
all
under
sentence
of
death
but
with
a
sort
of
indefinite
reprieve
les

we
have
an
