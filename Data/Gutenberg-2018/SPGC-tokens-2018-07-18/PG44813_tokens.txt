placed
the
black
box
on
the
study
table
ensign
mills
interviewed
sally
you
mean
i
ll
have
to
drop
from
the
sky
she
stepped
out
on
the
roof
and
clung
to
the
gable
barbara
s
head
came
out
from
beneath
the
covers
barbara
was
staring
gloomily
at
the
floor
good
old
chute
sally
murmured
danny
what
are
you
doing
here
they
swung
out
over
the
sea
again
it
could
be
a
flight
of
our
riggs
i
m
convinced
the
captain
declared
i
thought
you
might
need
me
she
said
danny
watched
the
last
little
traveler
pass
sally
stood
looking
at
the
endless
black
waters
a
sailor
helped
sally
to
her
feet
sally
saw
two
sailors
carry
riggs
out
they
watched
breathlessly
as
the
bomb
struck
see
i
have
a
present
for
you
said
sally
she
hit
the
water
near
danny
s
raft
illustration
sally
placed
the
black
box
on
the
study
table
sally
scott
of
the
waves
chapter
one
up
the
ladder
it
was
of
a
cloudy
day
in
early
autumn
sally
scott
glided
to
the
one
wide
window
in
her
room
and
pulled
down
the
shade
then
with
movements
that
somehow
suggested
deep
secrecy
she
took
an
oblong
black
box
not
unlike
an
overnight
bag
from
the
closet
after
placing
this
with
some
care
on
her
study
table
she
pressed
a
button
and
caught
the
broad
side
of
the
box
that
falling
away
revealed
a
neat
row
of
buttons
and
switches
above
these
was
an
opening
where
a
number
of
spots
shone
dimly
after
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
sally
shook
her
head
tossing
her
hair
about
fixed
her
eyes
on
this
strange
box
and
then
with
her
long
slender
nervous
fingers
threw
on
a
switch
another
and
yet
another
in
quick
succession
settling
back
in
her
chair
she
watched
the
spots
above
the
switches
turn
into
tiny
gleaming
red
lamps
that
gave
off
an
eerie
light
red
for
blood
black
for
death
someone
had
said
to
her
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
from
the
box
came
a
low
humming
sound
she
turned
a
switch
the
hum
increased
she
turned
it
again
and
once
more
the
hum
rose
in
intensity
this
time
however
it
was
different
suddenly
the
hum
was
broken
by
a
low
indistinct
oh
the
girl
s
lips
parted
as
a
look
of
surprise
and
almost
of
triumph
spread
over
her
face
and
then
suddenly
she
started
to
leap
from
her
chair
a
key
had
rattled
in
the
door
before
she
could
decide
what
she
should
do
the
door
swung
open
and
someone
snapped
on
a
light
and
then
a
voice
said
oh
i
m
sorry
i
ve
been
in
the
bright
sunlight
the
room
seemed
completely
it
really
doesn
t
matter
sally
spoke
slowly
studying
the
other
girl
s
face
as
she
did
so
the
girl
was
large
and
tall
her
hair
was
jet
black
she
had
a
round
face
and
dark
friendly
eyes
this
much
sally
learned
at
a
glance
it
doesn
t
matter
she
repeated
i
suppose
we
are
to
be
it
looks
that
way
the
other
girl
agreed
i
just
she
set
her
bag
on
the
floor
i
sally
was
still
thinking
her
way
along
then
i
suppose
you
don
t
know
that
we
are
not
allowed
to
have
radios
in
our
but
you
see
i
have
one
sally
went
on
i
suppose
i
could
be
sent
home
for
keeping
it
but
i
m
going
to
chance
it
ve
just
got
to
s
terribly
important
that
i
keep
it
you
can
see
it
s
not
like
other
radios
it
s
red
eyes
the
other
girl
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
but
that
s
not
all
you
couldn
t
listen
to
a
program
on
it
if
you
tried
s
very
different
there
are
only
two
others
like
it
in
all
the
i
see
said
the
new
girl
no
you
don
t
see
at
all
sally
declared
you
couldn
t
possibly
the
only
question
right
now
is
will
you
share
my
secret
can
i
count
on
you
yes
the
girl
replied
simply
and
she
meant
just
that
sally
was
sure
of
it
thanks
her
eyes
shone
you
won
t
be
sorry
whatever
may
happen
you
ll
not
be
dragged
into
it
and
she
added
after
a
pause
there
s
nothing
really
wrong
about
it
i
m
a
loyal
american
citizen
too
loyal
perhaps
but
you
see
my
father
was
in
the
world
war
grandfather
at
manila
bay
and
all
my
father
died
in
france
the
large
girl
said
simply
i
was
too
young
to
recall
that
was
really
tough
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
fun
with
my
dad
but
excuse
once
again
sally
s
fingers
gripped
a
knob
and
the
mysterious
radio
set
up
a
new
sort
of
hum
with
a
headset
clamped
over
her
ears
she
listened
intently
then
said
in
a
low
tone
hello
nancy
are
you
there
again
she
listened
then
laughed
low
i
m
sorry
nancy
she
apologized
speaking
through
a
small
mouthpiece
something
terribly
exciting
happened
i
got
something
on
the
shortest
where
nothing
s
supposed
to
be
yes
i
did
she
exclaimed
then
no
it
can
t
be
fifteen
minutes
oh
boy
i
ll
have
to
step
on
it
ll
be
right
down
meet
you
at
the
foot
of
the
what
ladder
the
big
girl
asked
in
surprise
the
one
from
first
floor
to
second
of
course
we
don
t
have
stairways
in
this
place
you
know
only
sally
laughed
low
after
turning
off
the
switches
sally
snapped
the
black
box
shut
then
hid
it
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
closet
but
i
just
came
up
a
stairway
the
new
girl
insisted
oh
no
you
didn
t
sally
laughed
it
was
a
ladder
you
re
new
here
so
you
ll
have
to
work
that
one
out
i
m
sure
you
ll
find
i
m
sally
was
hastily
putting
on
hat
coat
and
gloves
i
ve
got
to
skip
have
my
personal
interview
in
fifteen
minutes
that
s
where
they
try
to
find
out
what
we
re
good
for
what
s
your
specialty
oh
yes
and
what
s
your
name
i
m
barbara
brown
and
i
m
scared
to
death
for
fear
they
ll
send
me
home
i
haven
t
done
a
thing
but
sew
and
work
in
a
laundry
and
cook
a
they
ll
find
a
place
for
you
just
tell
them
your
life
story
don
t
be
afraid
you
ll
sally
was
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
ladder
before
barbara
could
have
counted
ten
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
she
met
nancy
mcbride
a
girl
she
had
known
well
in
the
days
of
basketball
it
s
perfectly
terrible
starting
out
in
a
new
place
with
a
deep
secret
sally
said
in
a
low
tone
as
they
hurried
away
toward
the
mary
sacks
where
interviews
for
all
recent
recruits
were
conducted
yes
it
is
nancy
agreed
soberly
a
trifle
wacky
if
you
d
ask
but
it
s
so
very
important
sally
insisted
more
important
than
making
good
with
the
waves
nancy
asked
soberly
for
my
part
i
can
t
think
of
a
thing
in
the
world
that
could
be
half
as
important
as
that
that
s
just
how
i
feel
about
yes
that
s
right
oh
if
i
were
thrown
out
of
the
waves
i
d
just
want
to
sally
s
face
took
on
a
tragic
look
and
and
yet
what
well
you
just
don
t
know
old
kennedy
that
s
all
i
ve
been
working
with
him
since
i
was
fifteen
and
now
i
m
working
at
radio
what
did
you
know
about
radio
when
you
were
fifteen
that
s
just
it
i
didn
t
know
a
thing
you
see
a
radio
came
dropping
right
out
of
the
sky
out
of
the
sky
nancy
stared
yes
right
into
the
middle
of
a
meadow
where
i
was
looking
for
a
meadowlark
s
say
why
don
t
you
talk
sense
you
can
t
expect
shush
sally
whispered
here
s
the
gangplank
of
the
mary
we
ll
have
to
get
right
in
don
t
betray
me
i
ll
explain
it
all
as
they
entered
a
girl
in
the
nobby
blue
uniform
of
a
wave
said
take
the
ladder
to
deck
two
turn
to
the
right
and
there
you
yes
sally
said
to
nancy
with
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
there
we
are
right
in
the
midst
of
things
some
examiner
will
probe
our
minds
to
find
out
how
much
we
know
how
keen
we
are
what
our
motives
for
joining
up
were
and
then
she
ll
start
deciding
what
we
can
do
best
nancy
broke
in
and
if
she
decides
i
ll
make
a
good
secretary
to
an
admiral
sally
sighed
i
ll
wish
i
hadn
t
come
she
took
a
long
breath
here
we
go
up
fortune
s
ladder
wish
you
same
to
then
up
they
went
in
the
meantime
the
big
girl
barbara
opened
her
bag
shook
out
her
clothes
packed
some
away
in
a
drawer
hung
others
up
then
dropped
into
a
chair
for
a
few
long
long
thoughts
the
truth
was
at
that
moment
she
wished
she
hadn
t
come
she
thought
of
the
steam
laundry
where
she
had
worked
for
three
years
all
the
girls
laughing
and
talking
the
fine
clean
smell
of
sheets
as
they
ran
through
the
mangle
the
rattle
and
clank
of
machines
and
the
slap
of
all
came
to
her
with
a
rush
it
s
all
so
strange
she
whispered
go
down
the
ladder
that
s
what
she
said
what
ladder
i
wonder
then
she
jumped
up
she
would
have
to
get
out
of
here
begin
to
face
things
what
things
just
any
things
if
you
faced
them
they
lost
their
terror
they
stepped
to
one
side
and
let
you
by
after
putting
on
her
hat
and
coat
she
opened
the
door
to
stand
there
for
a
moment
truth
was
she
was
looking
for
the
ladder
hi
there
came
in
a
cheery
voice
as
a
girl
in
a
natty
blue
suit
and
jaunty
hat
rounded
a
corner
in
the
hall
you
re
one
of
the
new
ones
aren
t
you
close
the
hatch
and
let
s
get
down
the
ladder
for
a
coke
at
the
the
barbara
faltered
what
s
a
hatch
and
where
s
the
ladder
right
the
girl
in
blue
broke
off
i
forgot
of
course
you
wouldn
t
know
you
see
we
are
waves
you
and
yes
so
this
place
we
live
in
is
a
ship
at
least
we
say
it
is
this
is
not
the
second
floor
but
the
second
deck
the
door
is
a
hatch
the
walls
bulkheads
and
of
course
the
stairway
is
a
oh
barbara
beamed
that
s
the
way
it
is
of
course
sally
and
nancy
had
not
boarded
a
ship
for
their
interview
the
mary
sacks
was
a
two
story
building
turned
over
by
the
college
to
the
waves
and
it
was
up
a
stairs
not
a
real
ladder
that
the
two
girls
climbed
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
program
that
was
to
turn
girls
from
all
walks
of
life
into
sailors
your
name
is
sally
scott
said
a
girl
in
a
waves
uniform
that
s
right
said
sally
come
into
my
parlor
the
girl
said
smiling
broadly
and
indicating
a
small
booth
furnished
with
two
chairs
and
a
narrow
table
said
the
spider
to
the
sally
returned
the
smile
as
she
finished
the
oh
it
s
not
nearly
as
bad
as
that
said
the
blonde
examiner
the
fly
did
not
escape
you
will
i
am
six
months
after
the
war
is
sally
did
not
smile
yes
that
sounds
a
bit
serious
doesn
t
it
it
certainly
does
sally
agreed
it
s
nice
to
have
a
sense
of
humor
and
also
a
serious
side
said
the
examiner
we
like
them
that
way
you
should
get
on
thanks
i
m
glad
you
think
my
name
is
marjory
mills
i
won
t
keep
you
long
at
least
not
longer
than
you
wish
to
ensign
mills
motioned
sally
to
a
chair
by
the
way
she
said
as
she
dropped
into
the
opposite
chair
why
did
you
want
to
join
the
waves
it
s
our
war
we
re
all
in
it
i
hate
the
way
the
people
of
france
belgium
and
all
the
rest
are
treated
they
re
slaves
they
ve
got
to
be
yes
of
i
ve
three
cousins
in
the
war
we
were
great
pals
all
the
boys
of
our
crowd
are
gone
and
some
of
the
lonesome
is
that
it
no
not
entirely
i
want
them
to
come
back
never
wanted
anything
quite
so
much
they
can
t
come
back
until
we
ve
done
all
we
can
to
help
that
s
true
ensign
mills
spoke
quietly
you
re
sure
that
it
wasn
t
romance
love
of
excitement
the
desire
to
go
places
and
see
things
that
brought
you
here
sally
looked
into
the
other
girl
s
eyes
then
said
yes
of
course
it
was
in
part
no
one
motive
ever
draws
us
into
making
a
great
decision
at
least
not
often
of
course
i
dream
of
romance
adventure
and
travel
who
doesn
t
we
all
do
marjory
mills
agreed
frankly
the
only
thing
is
those
can
t
be
our
main
motives
if
they
were
we
should
meet
disappointment
and
perhaps
miserably
fail
blood
sweat
and
that
is
what
we
have
ahead
of
yes
sally
replied
soberly
i
know
my
father
has
told
me
he
was
in
france
for
more
than
a
in
the
last
war
yes
then
you
would
know
we
like
to
have
daughters
of
veterans
some
of
them
are
among
our
best
and
now
marjory
mills
s
voice
was
brisk
again
what
do
you
think
you
d
like
to
do
or
first
would
you
like
to
tell
me
your
story
i
d
love
to
how
much
time
have
i
sally
looked
at
her
watch
as
much
as
you
ensign
mills
settled
back
in
her
chair
shoot
chapter
two
the
radio
from
the
sky
i
grew
up
as
every
child
must
sally
began
until
i
was
fifteen
we
weren
t
rich
not
terribly
poor
either
middle
class
the
examiner
murmured
best
people
in
the
and
then
something
happened
sally
announced
what
was
that
i
was
in
a
meadow
looking
for
a
meadowlark
s
nest
when
a
radio
fell
from
the
you
wouldn
t
by
any
chance
be
kidding
marjory
mills
s
eyes
opened
wide
sally
sat
up
straight
no
i
wouldn
t
it
wasn
t
a
big
radio
only
a
tiny
how
far
did
it
fall
about
seventy
thousand
only
about
fourteen
miles
not
much
of
a
tumble
after
once
again
marjory
mills
s
eyes
were
wide
it
didn
t
hit
the
ground
very
hard
it
wasn
t
illustration
ensign
mills
interviewed
sally
no
i
suppose
well
it
wasn
sally
talked
rapidly
it
was
attached
to
what
was
left
of
a
large
paper
balloon
as
it
went
up
taking
the
radio
with
it
the
balloon
expanded
it
got
larger
and
larger
at
seventy
thousand
feet
the
balloon
burst
and
the
radio
came
i
see
said
marjory
mills
don
t
see
at
least
i
m
quite
sure
you
don
sally
half
apologized
the
radio
had
been
sent
up
by
a
very
nice
old
man
who
wanted
to
know
about
the
weather
as
it
went
up
the
radio
a
sending
set
broadcast
certain
information
about
the
weather
don
t
ask
me
how
because
i
don
t
know
all
about
that
all
i
knew
at
the
time
was
that
attached
to
the
radio
was
a
card
and
on
the
card
was
written
if
the
finder
of
this
radio
will
return
it
to
kennedy
at
ferndale
he
will
receive
a
five
dollar
reward
and
you
needed
a
new
spring
dress
so
you
returned
the
exactly
how
did
you
ever
guess
that
they
joined
in
a
merry
laugh
but
i
m
not
sally
s
face
sobered
it
s
every
bit
of
course
was
the
quick
response
tell
me
the
well
you
know
that
nice
old
man
kennedy
had
lived
in
my
own
town
for
three
years
and
i
d
never
heard
of
him
he
owned
a
tiny
house
down
by
the
river
back
of
the
house
was
his
shop
where
he
invented
oh
then
he
was
an
inventor
sure
he
is
when
i
brought
him
the
radio
i
asked
him
why
he
sent
it
up
into
the
sky
he
told
me
all
about
it
how
he
could
learn
all
sorts
of
things
about
how
cold
it
would
be
when
it
would
rain
and
all
that
just
by
sending
up
radios
to
listen
in
for
him
that
s
the
way
it
sally
heaved
a
sigh
old
called
him
that
and
i
never
knew
his
first
was
so
kind
and
told
me
so
much
that
i
went
back
again
lots
of
times
by
and
by
i
started
helping
him
just
doing
little
things
i
told
people
how
good
he
was
with
radios
and
they
started
bringing
them
to
be
fixed
we
came
to
have
quite
a
business
as
soon
as
high
school
was
over
i
worked
there
all
the
you
must
have
made
quite
a
lot
of
oh
no
not
so
much
you
see
sally
leaned
forward
we
were
like
some
very
fine
surgeons
we
charged
what
people
could
afford
to
i
and
there
are
lots
more
poor
people
than
rich
when
a
little
lame
boy
came
in
with
a
very
cheap
radio
that
got
the
stations
all
jumbled
up
we
put
in
more
transformers
and
tubes
practically
made
a
new
radio
out
of
it
then
it
worked
and
then
you
charged
just
a
but
when
a
rich
man
brought
you
his
big
fussy
radio
that
would
get
berlin
tokio
london
and
maybe
mars
you
charged
plenty
sally
laughed
yes
your
old
must
have
been
a
fine
man
but
what
about
the
inventions
oh
sally
frowned
he
s
such
a
sensitive
old
man
is
we
invented
something
quite
is
did
that
was
quite
a
while
ago
i
didn
t
know
much
about
it
but
we
could
ride
about
at
night
in
his
rattly
old
car
and
every
now
and
then
he
d
stop
and
say
see
some
young
fellow
off
there
is
operating
a
sending
we
could
have
driven
right
up
to
his
door
if
we
wanted
to
but
we
never
it
was
a
yes
and
said
it
was
the
best
one
ever
what
came
of
it
nothing
you
see
was
very
fond
of
his
country
he
thought
uncle
sam
should
have
his
invention
so
mother
and
i
fixed
him
up
the
best
we
just
wasn
t
interested
in
we
sent
him
off
to
washington
and
sally
sighed
deeply
he
just
couldn
t
stand
waiting
they
kept
him
waiting
three
days
then
because
he
was
old
and
a
little
bit
shabby
they
thought
he
didn
t
know
much
so
nothing
came
of
it
just
nothing
came
back
discouraged
and
downhearted
but
pretty
soon
we
were
working
as
hard
as
ever
and
now
sally
s
eyes
shone
you
just
ought
to
the
light
in
sally
s
eyes
faded
just
in
time
she
caught
herself
she
had
been
about
to
betray
the
secret
of
the
black
box
up
there
in
her
room
can
t
tell
you
she
apologized
i
just
must
not
it
s
his
of
course
that
s
all
right
marjory
mills
agreed
that
really
doesn
t
matter
the
only
thing
that
matters
just
now
is
how
do
you
fit
in
with
the
waves
s
sally
leaned
forward
eager
and
alert
i
ll
just
go
down
our
little
list
marjory
mills
smiled
you
can
tell
me
which
category
you
d
like
to
try
for
the
dollar
question
now
listen
carefully
and
tell
me
when
to
stop
here
they
are
secretarial
work
typing
bookkeeping
aviation
ground
work
parachute
rigging
operating
a
link
to
all
this
sally
shook
her
head
but
when
the
examiner
read
communication
including
radio
she
sat
up
with
a
start
to
exclaim
that
s
it
yes
marjory
mills
agreed
that
beyond
a
doubt
is
it
ultimately
you
ll
go
to
a
special
school
for
perfecting
your
training
you
ll
need
to
know
about
sending
and
receiving
in
code
blinker
signaling
flag
signaling
and
a
lot
more
but
first
she
settled
back
in
her
chair
you
ll
have
to
stay
right
here
in
mt
morris
college
learning
for
the
most
part
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
oh
must
i
sally
cried
in
sudden
dismay
you
ll
love
marjory
mills
s
words
carried
conviction
when
it
s
all
over
you
ll
agree
i
m
sure
that
we
ve
made
a
real
sailor
out
of
you
and
that
you
would
not
have
missed
it
for
and
after
that
special
school
sally
asked
eagerly
after
that
perhaps
you
ll
find
yourself
in
an
airplane
directing
tower
saying
to
the
pilots
of
great
flying
fortresses
come
in
all
right
you
re
off
and
things
like
that
thrilling
what
wonderful
and
after
that
perhaps
i
ll
be
on
some
small
airplane
carrier
in
a
convoy
crossing
the
yes
just
perhaps
there
is
a
law
before
congress
now
which
if
passed
will
permit
us
to
send
waves
on
sea
voyages
and
to
service
overseas
the
wacs
are
already
oh
congress
must
pass
that
sally
half
rose
in
her
chair
again
she
was
thinking
of
her
secret
in
the
black
box
they
just
must
pass
that
don
t
hope
too
much
the
examiner
warned
ours
not
to
reason
ours
but
to
do
or
die
sally
finished
in
a
whisper
and
so
her
interview
came
to
an
end
in
the
meantime
nancy
mcbride
was
going
through
her
examination
with
much
the
same
result
she
too
was
a
radio
bug
she
and
her
lame
brother
had
been
radio
hams
since
she
was
a
dozen
years
old
though
she
had
lived
in
another
small
city
she
and
sally
had
been
good
friends
for
some
time
that
was
why
sally
had
dared
trust
her
with
s
secret
and
one
of
her
much
treasured
black
boxes
oh
she
had
exclaimed
on
seeing
nancy
on
the
train
that
carried
her
to
mt
morris
and
her
new
home
you
re
really
going
to
be
a
wave
surest
thing
nancy
had
thrown
her
arms
about
her
and
you
too
that
s
right
sally
agreed
oh
boy
she
had
whispered
when
they
had
found
a
seat
together
do
you
take
the
load
off
my
mind
why
how
come
nancy
demanded
in
great
surprise
shush
it
s
a
sally
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
it
s
a
deep
secret
you
know
old
yes
of
course
he
s
given
s
my
brother
you
me
a
lot
of
fine
well
he
and
i
have
been
working
on
something
for
weeks
and
weeks
it
s
a
lot
too
deep
for
me
but
it
s
a
radio
that
works
with
shorter
than
any
that
have
been
used
yet
you
know
what
that
might
mean
yes
guess
so
you
could
send
messages
to
someone
having
the
same
sort
of
radio
and
no
one
else
could
hear
not
a
wonderful
did
you
get
it
worked
out
yes
only
a
few
days
before
i
was
to
leave
i
took
one
portable
radio
to
a
place
twenty
miles
away
and
talked
to
back
there
in
his
shop
we
could
hear
each
other
plainly
that
was
a
great
day
for
and
for
yes
but
a
greater
one
came
when
he
took
me
into
his
shop
that
day
before
i
left
and
said
sally
i
want
you
to
take
these
two
black
boxes
with
but
i
said
those
are
your
two
secret
secret
radios
your
choicest
possessions
i
can
make
more
of
that
s
what
he
said
then
he
went
on
once
i
tried
to
give
one
of
my
inventions
to
our
country
i
failed
and
later
someone
stole
it
from
me
now
sally
it
s
your
how
strange
nancy
whispered
what
did
he
mean
that
s
what
i
asked
him
sally
whispered
excitedly
he
said
i
was
to
take
these
radios
with
me
that
i
was
to
get
someone
who
could
be
trusted
to
help
me
and
as
i
found
time
to
test
the
radios
listen
in
for
any
other
radios
that
might
be
using
those
do
all
i
could
to
see
what
could
be
accomplished
with
them
to
aid
our
that
nancy
said
is
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
not
so
strange
after
all
sally
said
soberly
he
knew
i
was
going
first
to
a
school
close
to
the
sea
where
i
might
listen
for
messages
then
too
i
am
to
be
a
wave
perhaps
i
shall
travel
in
a
convoy
across
the
sea
what
a
chance
that
will
be
to
try
out
the
radios
yes
what
a
chance
nancy
sally
whispered
tensely
will
you
be
the
one
who
can
be
trusted
will
you
join
me
in
testing
s
radios
why
nancy
hesitated
yes
yes
i
will
you
are
my
friend
is
my
friend
i
also
love
america
and
want
to
help
so
why
not
and
that
is
how
it
came
about
that
as
they
walked
slowly
back
to
their
staterooms
on
a
ship
that
was
a
ship
in
name
only
sally
and
nancy
talked
of
radio
and
of
the
day
when
they
would
be
waves
serving
their
country
and
here
s
hoping
they
put
us
on
an
ship
sally
exclaimed
here
s
hoping
nancy
echoed
chapter
three
a
message
in
code
in
the
meantime
with
a
worried
look
still
on
her
face
barbara
sat
at
a
small
table
drinking
hot
chocolate
while
her
companion
in
the
chic
blue
waves
suit
enjoyed
a
coke
hot
chocolate
will
make
you
fat
said
belle
mason
barbara
s
new
friend
i
m
fat
already
barbara
smiled
an
even
hundred
and
you
re
big
not
fat
her
companion
corrected
that
s
not
a
bad
weight
at
all
for
your
height
what
are
you
to
do
for
the
waves
that
s
just
barbara
s
frown
deepened
i
don
t
know
much
about
anything
but
cooking
housework
and
home
laundry
no
steam
laundry
i
know
you
ll
think
i
was
silly
but
just
out
of
i
went
into
a
laundry
to
work
i
ve
never
done
anything
you
liked
it
of
course
or
you
wouldn
t
have
yes
i
like
the
nice
clean
smell
of
the
shiny
white
sheets
and
pillow
cases
and
the
cozy
warm
feeling
of
everything
i
like
to
run
the
sheets
through
the
mangle
fold
them
just
right
then
run
them
through
again
i
like
to
stack
them
up
just
right
in
clean
white
piles
oh
i
guess
i
m
hopeless
barbara
sighed
just
an
old
hag
of
a
laundry
worker
what
can
the
waves
do
with
a
creature
like
that
you
ll
be
just
wonderful
her
companion
beamed
barbara
stared
sure
they
ll
make
a
parachute
rigger
out
of
parachute
rigger
what
s
that
you
know
that
all
fighting
airmen
wear
parachutes
don
t
you
yes
of
course
and
that
those
parachutes
often
save
their
lives
in
fact
have
already
saved
thousands
of
lives
yes
parachutes
don
t
just
grow
on
trees
like
walnuts
they
have
to
be
made
with
great
care
and
arranged
with
greater
care
the
rigger
is
the
one
who
packs
them
into
their
oh
i
d
love
that
sure
you
would
and
it
s
a
tremendously
important
job
one
slip
is
all
it
takes
if
a
parachute
is
folded
wrong
some
fine
fellow
comes
shooting
down
down
thousands
of
feet
to
his
death
but
love
to
do
things
just
right
even
bed
yes
i
then
you
ll
be
the
best
there
is
good
parachute
riggers
are
hard
to
get
of
course
belle
went
on
you
don
t
just
fold
parachutes
and
pack
them
you
select
large
ones
for
large
and
small
ones
for
small
people
sure
in
some
of
them
you
pack
iron
rations
food
for
a
day
or
so
in
others
you
ll
put
light
pneumatic
rubber
rafts
and
fishing
s
in
case
the
flier
might
land
in
the
sea
then
of
course
there
are
paper
balloons
to
be
rigged
for
dropping
food
and
medicine
and
small
silk
ones
for
dogs
yes
of
course
the
dogs
of
real
dogs
certainly
dogs
have
played
an
important
part
in
all
wars
they
carry
messages
keep
the
night
watches
and
warn
their
masters
of
approaching
enemies
yes
they
have
their
parachutes
and
many
of
them
beg
to
have
their
chutes
strapped
do
they
really
like
dropping
from
the
sky
oh
don
t
they
though
and
that
reminds
me
i
don
t
want
to
frighten
you
but
because
of
the
great
importance
of
their
work
and
so
they
will
realize
to
the
full
just
how
important
it
is
there
is
talk
of
having
each
parachute
rigger
make
at
least
one
parachute
what
you
barbara
appeared
to
shrink
up
in
her
chair
you
mean
i
ll
have
to
drop
from
way
up
in
the
sky
you
might
be
asked
i
d
barbara
s
face
paled
oh
no
you
wouldn
t
thousands
are
doing
it
every
i
m
so
big
i
d
go
right
on
down
into
the
barbara
laughed
nervously
oh
no
parachutes
are
made
to
fit
their
owners
some
are
made
for
dropping
five
hundred
pound
antiaircraft
guns
but
don
t
let
that
worry
you
belle
hastened
to
add
you
may
never
be
asked
to
jump
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
i
didn
t
think
that
up
but
it
s
good
all
the
one
thing
still
worries
barbara
said
a
moment
later
what
s
that
my
interview
my
roommate
just
went
to
take
you
may
forget
belle
smiled
an
odd
smile
you
ve
practically
had
yours
i
had
mine
illustration
you
mean
i
ll
have
to
drop
from
the
sky
sure
i
m
one
of
the
examiners
this
is
my
hour
off
when
your
time
comes
just
ask
to
be
examined
by
ensign
belle
mason
we
ll
get
it
over
with
in
a
jiffy
and
belle
stood
up
i
must
get
back
to
my
post
and
help
solve
other
cases
that
are
really
difficult
it
s
nice
to
have
had
a
talk
with
s
been
then
belle
mason
was
gone
that
evening
after
they
had
eaten
their
dinner
in
an
attractive
college
dining
room
the
two
girls
sally
and
barbara
walked
slowly
back
to
their
room
already
sally
was
beginning
to
know
what
her
examiner
had
meant
when
she
said
speaking
of
the
life
at
mt
morris
you
ll
love
sally
had
never
even
dreamed
of
a
college
education
there
was
not
nearly
enough
money
for
that
but
now
here
she
was
a
student
in
a
real
college
it
s
quite
an
old
college
isn
t
it
barbara
said
one
of
the
oldest
in
new
england
sally
agreed
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
see
how
the
sun
shines
through
those
great
old
and
how
the
ivy
clings
to
the
red
brick
walls
it
s
wonderful
i
could
almost
forgive
the
war
just
because
it
s
given
us
a
new
sort
of
life
but
oh
gee
barbara
exclaimed
just
think
of
having
to
drop
from
way
up
there
in
the
sky
who
said
we
had
to
sally
demanded
sharply
not
all
of
us
just
me
barbara
told
her
of
the
impromptu
interview
well
if
you
have
to
go
up
i
ll
go
with
you
sally
declared
you
wouldn
t
why
not
if
i
m
to
work
with
radio
i
may
be
sent
up
as
a
radioman
for
a
bomber
then
i
ll
want
to
know
just
how
to
step
out
into
thin
all
right
barbara
exclaimed
it
s
a
date
if
i
step
through
a
hole
in
the
sky
you
re
to
come
stepping
right
after
it
s
a
date
sally
agreed
that
evening
barbara
went
to
a
movie
with
one
of
the
girls
who
had
come
in
on
the
same
train
left
to
herself
sally
sat
for
a
long
time
in
her
dark
room
just
thinking
those
were
long
long
thoughts
she
had
been
there
long
enough
to
realize
as
never
before
what
a
change
was
to
come
into
her
life
i
m
in
for
the
duration
she
thought
with
a
thrill
and
a
shudder
how
long
would
the
duration
be
no
one
knew
that
one
thing
was
sure
life
all
kinds
of
life
grows
broader
it
s
like
a
river
on
its
way
to
the
sea
she
thought
the
life
of
the
waves
was
sure
to
be
like
that
just
now
they
were
not
asked
to
go
outside
the
united
states
how
long
would
this
last
not
long
perhaps
i
almost
hope
it
won
t
she
told
herself
and
yet
she
shuddered
afresh
at
the
thought
of
life
aboard
a
transport
or
a
destroyer
with
of
enemy
subs
haunting
the
black
waters
but
there
s
s
radio
she
told
herself
a
sea
trip
would
give
me
a
grand
chance
to
try
it
that
this
radio
was
a
marvelous
invention
she
did
not
doubt
yet
the
modest
old
man
had
forbidden
her
to
mention
it
to
a
single
person
who
might
be
interested
in
its
use
and
promotion
i
may
discover
flaws
in
it
had
been
his
word
there
is
always
plenty
of
time
you
just
take
these
two
sets
and
try
them
out
test
them
in
every
way
you
can
then
let
me
know
what
you
let
me
know
what
you
discover
she
whispered
she
had
made
a
discovery
of
a
sort
that
very
afternoon
something
very
like
a
radio
message
in
code
had
come
in
on
her
secret
wave
length
where
it
was
thought
no
messages
had
ever
been
sent
i
ll
try
it
again
she
told
herself
springing
to
her
feet
she
dragged
the
black
box
from
its
hiding
place
with
the
lights
still
off
she
turned
on
a
switch
to
watch
the
many
tubes
glow
red
after
twisting
two
dials
and
adjusting
one
of
them
very
carefully
she
listened
intently
and
after
a
moment
s
wait
was
thrilled
once
again
by
the
low
wait
wait
again
after
turning
a
dial
half
around
she
listened
again
the
sound
came
but
this
time
very
faintly
yes
even
as
she
listened
there
came
another
it
was
louder
and
of
a
different
quality
of
sound
ah
she
breathed
two
of
you
so
she
worked
for
an
hour
at
the
end
of
that
hour
she
knew
there
were
four
out
there
somewhere
were
they
radios
of
american
planes
enemy
subs
or
ships
of
our
allies
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
snapping
off
two
switches
she
turned
on
a
third
after
ten
seconds
of
waiting
she
whispered
into
her
mouthpiece
i
m
alone
come
on
down
can
you
after
that
she
whispered
that
s
swell
two
minutes
later
nancy
came
tiptoeing
into
the
dark
room
what
s
the
meaning
of
all
this
darkness
and
secrecy
she
whispered
low
it
s
for
effect
sally
laughed
close
the
hatch
softly
and
sit
down
here
beside
me
on
the
deck
i
ve
something
for
you
to
sally
turned
on
the
radio
then
as
the
began
she
turned
the
dial
to
catch
the
different
grades
of
sound
that
s
someone
broadcasting
in
code
she
declared
sounds
more
like
a
mouse
chewing
a
board
nancy
laughed
all
the
same
it
s
code
of
some
sally
insisted
and
i
m
going
to
figure
it
out
trouble
is
it
comes
in
low
and
an
outside
aerial
would
help
wouldn
t
it
yes
of
there
s
one
on
top
of
this
there
is
sally
exclaimed
then
we
ll
run
a
wire
up
to
it
but
how
will
we
get
it
up
there
without
being
seen
let
s
nancy
counted
up
to
six
on
her
fingers
then
she
slipped
out
through
the
door
she
was
back
almost
at
once
with
the
good
news
that
her
room
was
directly
over
sally
s
we
can
run
the
wires
along
the
heat
pipes
she
explained
there
s
even
a
pipe
running
from
my
room
to
the
attic
though
i
can
t
see
even
then
we
ll
not
be
on
the
roof
sally
mourned
there
are
two
gable
windows
on
each
side
of
the
attic
nancy
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
up
to
the
attic
you
can
step
right
out
on
the
roof
from
a
and
i
suppose
you
re
going
to
tell
me
you
have
a
key
to
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
attic
stairway
sally
laughed
no
but
i
have
quite
a
way
with
locks
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
said
nancy
but
sally
she
protested
you
d
think
we
were
sweet
sixteen
and
in
a
boarding
school
instead
of
grown
young
ladies
sworn
in
to
serve
we
ll
serve
america
in
a
big
way
sally
insisted
stoutly
if
only
we
get
this
secret
short
wave
doing
its
bit
you
just
wait
and
see
and
i
m
going
to
get
my
connection
with
that
aerial
on
the
roof
sooner
than
chapter
four
danny
duke
makes
a
catch
the
days
that
followed
were
busy
ones
there
were
shots
for
typhoid
smallpox
and
all
the
rest
with
many
a
sore
arm
they
marched
until
their
legs
ached
and
their
feet
were
sore
but
all
the
time
their
officers
were
so
kind
and
all
their
companions
so
friendly
that
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
long
hours
were
filled
with
classes
they
learned
history
of
the
navy
from
the
beginning
a
glorious
story
of
which
they
could
all
be
proud
navy
customs
came
in
for
their
full
share
of
discussion
boy
am
i
glad
i
am
getting
this
first
sally
exclaimed
one
day
without
it
i
d
be
completely
lost
aboard
a
but
we
re
not
sailing
on
a
ship
at
least
not
the
way
things
stand
now
said
nancy
all
the
same
we
re
going
in
for
communications
and
you
can
t
communicate
with
anyone
unless
you
speak
his
language
sally
laughed
you
ve
got
something
there
nancy
agreed
as
for
barbara
besides
her
regular
assigned
work
she
was
taken
to
an
airfield
where
paratroopers
were
being
trained
as
she
watched
ten
boys
one
by
one
slip
from
a
captive
balloon
hundreds
of
feet
in
the
sky
she
exclaimed
oh
i
could
never
do
that
when
she
saw
the
parachutes
white
against
a
blue
sky
come
drifting
down
and
watched
the
boys
drop
to
the
ground
as
if
they
were
dead
then
spring
up
laughing
she
exclaimed
that
s
wonderful
i
ll
do
anything
just
anything
to
have
a
part
in
that
for
a
time
the
two
black
boxes
were
neglected
then
one
night
they
came
back
with
a
bang
that
was
the
night
following
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
sally
s
old
friend
it
ran
dear
sally
received
yours
of
the
note
what
you
say
about
the
black
boxes
your
recent
discovery
may
be
of
the
greatest
importance
i
refer
to
the
disturbances
you
think
may
be
messages
in
code
on
that
it
can
hardly
be
anything
else
keep
it
up
you
may
make
a
startling
discovery
i
have
definite
theory
regarding
those
supposed
messages
but
will
not
tell
you
about
it
until
you
have
further
details
you
don
t
know
how
to
receive
in
code
do
you
it
s
not
difficult
get
someone
there
to
teach
you
i
agree
with
you
that
an
outside
aerial
will
help
bring
out
the
sounds
but
don
t
take
too
many
chances
just
to
make
an
old
man
s
dream
come
true
yours
for
success
too
many
chances
sally
exploded
after
reading
the
letter
there
couldn
t
possibly
be
too
many
that
very
night
she
started
taking
the
chances
it
was
a
cloudy
windy
night
just
the
night
for
a
murder
sally
whispered
to
nancy
as
they
embarked
on
their
enterprise
or
something
nancy
agreed
it
was
saturday
all
the
waves
have
saturday
afternoon
and
night
off
for
shore
leave
most
of
them
would
be
away
so
there
would
be
few
prying
eyes
that
was
why
they
had
picked
on
this
night
for
connecting
the
black
boxes
with
the
aerial
set
up
on
the
roof
the
wires
running
from
sally
s
room
up
to
nancy
s
and
to
the
attic
were
in
place
the
lock
to
the
attic
door
was
old
nancy
had
solved
that
with
a
skeleton
key
bought
at
the
five
and
ten
there
s
no
counting
of
noses
at
bedcheck
tonight
sally
said
so
we
ll
start
work
at
ten
you
can
be
the
lookout
and
i
ll
do
the
don
t
forget
you
re
going
to
be
quite
a
way
up
in
the
air
nancy
cautioned
oh
i
ve
always
been
a
sally
did
a
cartwheel
i
ll
put
on
gray
slacks
and
a
gray
sweater
just
in
case
the
moon
comes
out
the
roof
is
gray
you
you
d
better
wear
oh
sure
and
so
everything
was
set
for
the
hour
of
ten
all
clear
nancy
whispered
tiptoeing
down
the
hall
deck
three
is
deserted
come
on
armed
with
two
pairs
of
small
pliers
a
coil
of
wire
a
flashlight
and
the
key
to
the
attic
sally
followed
in
silence
to
the
floor
above
a
swift
glide
the
rattle
of
a
key
the
silent
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
and
sally
found
herself
tiptoeing
up
the
attic
stairs
it
was
a
dark
and
gloomy
spot
that
attic
as
nancy
had
put
it
a
hundred
years
look
at
you
up
this
was
true
for
an
accumulation
of
furniture
long
outmoded
was
stored
there
there
too
were
all
manner
of
stage
drops
and
settings
left
over
from
amateur
plays
with
her
flashlight
aimed
low
sally
picked
her
way
with
care
to
the
nearest
gable
window
the
window
was
nailed
down
but
her
pliers
soon
took
care
of
that
as
she
stepped
out
on
the
roof
clinging
to
the
gable
she
took
one
good
look
at
the
world
beneath
and
above
her
then
shuddered
with
dark
clouds
rolling
through
a
black
windy
sky
it
was
one
of
those
nights
that
always
seemed
to
depress
sally
shaking
herself
free
from
her
moodiness
she
gave
close
attention
to
the
problem
that
lay
before
her
to
discover
the
end
of
a
wire
they
had
thrust
up
along
the
heat
pipe
and
to
attach
the
end
of
her
coil
to
it
was
simple
enough
from
there
it
was
to
be
a
trifle
difficult
the
roof
was
not
too
steep
but
shingles
do
not
offer
much
chance
for
a
hand
grip
as
nancy
had
said
it
was
quite
a
distance
to
the
ground
from
there
and
though
she
would
not
have
admitted
it
for
worlds
sally
found
herself
a
little
dizzy
one
fact
gave
her
a
little
comfort
just
beneath
the
part
of
the
roof
where
she
must
do
her
climbing
was
an
elm
tree
its
top
was
broad
and
its
strong
flexible
branches
all
but
brushed
the
building
as
she
stood
there
hesitating
a
group
of
freshman
boys
came
marching
by
singing
illustration
she
stepped
out
on
the
roof
and
clung
to
the
gable
flattening
herself
against
the
gray
roof
she
waited
for
them
to
pass
then
having
steeled
herself
for
her
task
she
thrust
her
tools
into
her
pockets
held
the
loose
end
of
the
wire
in
her
teeth
and
began
to
climb
clutching
with
her
hands
and
pushing
with
her
feet
she
crept
upward
she
made
slow
progress
now
the
ridge
seemed
not
so
far
away
she
dared
not
look
back
or
down
she
was
halfway
up
when
with
startling
suddenness
the
moon
came
from
behind
a
cloud
gosh
she
exclaimed
flattening
herself
against
the
shingles
she
went
so
flat
that
she
started
slowly
to
slide
after
digging
in
with
toes
and
fingers
she
managed
to
hold
her
ground
and
then
the
moon
hid
its
face
one
more
desperate
struggle
and
she
found
herself
sitting
triumphantly
astride
the
ridge
now
she
breathed
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
pull
the
wire
tight
attach
it
to
the
aerial
and
then
slide
yes
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
just
to
slide
down
with
fingers
that
trembled
slightly
she
drew
the
gray
wire
tight
against
the
roof
cut
it
at
the
right
place
and
then
with
the
skill
of
a
lineman
wound
it
tight
round
and
round
the
original
wire
leading
to
the
aerial
she
had
twisted
herself
back
to
a
place
astride
the
roof
when
again
the
moon
showed
its
face
at
the
same
instant
she
thought
she
heard
someone
far
below
let
out
a
low
whistle
she
couldn
t
let
herself
be
seen
sitting
there
just
couldn
t
that
might
mean
catastrophe
then
it
happened
in
attempting
to
throw
herself
flat
she
overdid
the
matter
missing
a
grip
on
the
ridge
she
heard
her
flashlight
go
rolling
down
the
roof
and
in
quite
an
involuntary
manner
she
came
gliding
clawing
and
kicking
after
it
recalling
the
tree
and
at
the
same
time
realizing
that
she
was
powerless
to
check
her
slow
glide
she
managed
somehow
to
swing
half
about
when
she
left
the
roof
she
rolled
off
felt
the
brush
of
a
leafy
branch
struck
out
desperately
with
her
hands
gripped
a
branch
clung
there
and
found
herself
at
last
dangling
in
or
was
she
of
the
way
down
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
clinging
desperately
to
the
cracking
branch
she
dared
not
call
for
help
what
was
to
be
done
feeling
a
larger
branch
against
her
back
she
tried
to
turn
about
she
had
made
half
the
swing
just
as
her
slender
branch
gave
an
ominous
crack
at
the
same
time
a
voice
from
below
said
come
on
down
sister
i
ll
catch
good
grief
she
thought
it
s
a
and
then
the
branch
broke
she
landed
rather
solidly
in
a
pair
of
strong
arms
then
her
feet
hit
the
ground
also
the
moon
came
out
what
were
you
doing
up
there
the
man
held
her
as
if
she
were
a
sack
of
wheat
that
might
fall
over
the
moonlight
was
on
his
face
he
was
young
and
wore
a
heavy
blue
coat
his
cap
had
been
knocked
off
that
she
replied
slowly
is
a
military
secret
but
the
way
i
came
down
it
seems
is
common
she
did
not
try
to
escape
rather
uncommon
knowledge
i
d
say
he
drawled
you
might
have
broken
your
yes
or
been
you
were
that
he
chuckled
and
you
re
not
a
bad
catch
at
that
this
is
a
rather
lonesome
college
for
some
folks
tell
me
who
you
are
and
i
ll
let
you
go
i
will
anyway
he
said
dropping
his
hands
i
m
sally
scott
and
i
m
a
wave
she
confessed
a
wave
then
we
belong
to
the
same
outfit
i
m
a
flying
sailor
shake
he
put
out
a
hand
for
a
good
handclasp
oh
a
flying
sailor
she
exclaimed
then
you
could
teach
me
to
receive
in
certainly
i
could
and
will
in
my
spare
we
have
an
hour
after
suits
me
but
say
now
that
i
have
you
how
about
a
coke
and
a
chat
somewhere
she
did
not
reply
at
once
have
to
be
careful
mind
taking
my
pal
along
not
a
then
it
s
a
go
boy
nancy
will
think
i
m
dead
or
something
wait
i
ll
be
i
ll
she
was
gone
sally
scott
how
did
you
get
down
that
way
nancy
exclaimed
as
sally
came
racing
up
the
second
story
ladder
instead
of
coming
down
from
the
attic
found
a
new
way
to
get
down
and
and
i
found
a
nice
new
boy
sally
panted
he
wants
to
buy
us
a
coke
come
on
let
s
sally
you
didn
t
nancy
protested
besides
there
s
a
scratch
on
your
face
it
s
all
right
then
i
didn
sally
dabbed
at
her
cheek
you
won
t
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
the
try
all
right
then
after
i
got
the
wire
all
fixed
i
fell
off
the
roof
landed
in
a
tree
and
hung
to
a
branch
as
long
as
i

them
even
off
duty
you
know
so
sally
was
off
to
the
washroom
to
bathe
her
cheek
now
i
ask
you
nancy
challenged
the
empty
air
how
can
they
hope
to
make
a
wave
out
of
a
girl
like
that
sally
was
back
in
a
minute
and
slipped
into
her
uniform
nancy
was
ready
a
moment
later
and
then
they
were
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
night
this
is
nancy
sally
introduced
her
companion
to
the
flying
sailor
who
had
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
i
m
pleased
to
meet
you
nancy
i
m
danny
duke
he
said
distant
relative
of
the
famous
dukes
so
distant
that
they
never
even
sent
me
a
package
of
duke
s
mixture
do
you
also
walk
in
your
sleep
and
may
i
be
looking
for
you
on
the
roof
tops
sally
wasn
t
walking
in
her
sleep
said
nancy
but
tell
me
did
she
really
fall
off
the
roof
and
did
you
catch
her
shall
i
tell
her
danny
turned
to
sally
sure
tell
her
she
wouldn
t
believe
well
then
said
danny
in
a
voice
it
s
really
true
i
made
a
real
catch
that
time
but
then
the
elm
helped
out
a
good
old
elm
sally
exclaimed
i
ll
never
forget
it
and
now
she
added
i
feel
in
need
of
the
reviving
came
with
good
steaming
cups
of
coffee
danny
duke
could
stand
the
glare
of
a
neon
light
sally
found
as
she
looked
at
his
strong
friendly
face
i
m
just
past
twenty
he
told
them
with
a
touch
of
boyish
pride
and
my
training
is
about
finished
right
how
is
it
you
re
here
so
far
from
the
navy
flying
schools
nancy
asked
i
was
back
on
some
math
so
they
sent
me
here
to
brush
up
i
ve
about
got
it
now
another
two
weeks
will
do
too
bad
sally
sighed
but
that
will
be
time
enough
to
teach
me
to
receive
code
won
t
it
oh
sure
danny
grinned
but
say
are
you
the
practical
young
miss
here
i
save
your
life
and
first
thing
you
insist
that
i
do
something
more
for
it
s
not
for
leaning
across
the
table
sally
allowed
her
voice
to
drop
it
s
much
more
important
than
that
i
hope
it
s
for
our
old
friend
uncle
sam
the
things
i
did
up
there
on
the
roof
are
part
of
it
just
as
my
learning
code
will
be
you
are
such
a
nice
boy
i
want
you
to
have
a
part
in
well
danny
was
visibly
embarrassed
thanks
a
lot
i
ll
help
all
i
the
truth
is
that
danny
was
to
have
a
much
greater
part
in
the
undertaking
than
either
he
or
sally
knew
and
now
for
one
more
try
at
the
two
black
boxes
sally
whispered
excitedly
after
the
girls
had
said
at
the
gangplank
of
their
ship
that
really
wasn
t
a
ship
at
all
it
works
and
it
s
going
to
help
a
lot
that
aerial
is
sally
exclaimed
a
few
minutes
later
this
was
true
they
were
able
now
to
catch
the
of
those
secret
broadcasts
sent
from
radios
out
somewhere
on
land
or
sea
very
plainly
that
night
they
stayed
up
till
midnight
and
were
able
to
locate
seven
different
broadcasters
they
are
all
part
of
something
big
i
know
that
sally
insisted
but
is
it
a
sub
pack
a
flight
of
planes
or
a
convoy
of
ships
only
time
will
tell
was
nancy
s
reply
just
then
they
caught
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
hall
and
suddenly
their
secret
listenings
to
the
great
unknown
were
at
an
end
for
if
the
secret
radio
were
to
remain
just
that
they
must
take
great
care
not
to
expose
either
the
black
box
or
the
purpose
of
their
own
midnight
meetings
the
two
conspirators
did
not
intend
to
be
found
out
chapter
five
danny
shares
a
secret
there
was
a
glorious
hour
at
sunset
in
every
day
of
work
when
sally
was
free
to
do
as
she
chose
what
she
chose
more
often
than
not
in
the
days
that
followed
was
to
visit
a
certain
radio
lab
in
one
of
the
school
s
regular
buildings
here
she
found
danny
waiting
to
help
her
with
her
problems
she
discovered
at
once
that
he
did
know
a
very
great
deal
about
communication
and
about
radio
in
particular
when
she
complimented
him
on
his
knowledge
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
it
s
no
fault
of
mine
he
exclaimed
i
ve
had
it
drilled
into
me
from
the
very
start
we
re
in
the
navy
don
t
forget
that
most
of
us
will
be
on
aircraft
carriers
that
means
we
ll
be
out
over
the
sea
in
small
alone
sally
asked
sometimes
sometimes
not
you
may
have
a
radioman
and
may
not
anyway
he
may
get
killed
so
you
have
to
know
all
about
radio
blinking
lights
waving
flags
and
a
lot
more
say
he
laughed
i
could
propose
to
a
good
signal
girl
in
ten
different
wait
till
i
get
up
on
all
the
codes
sally
laughed
oh
yes
well
then
let
s
get
he
picked
up
a
booklet
entitled
international
code
and
turning
to
page
twelve
said
morse
code
isn
t
half
bad
see
here
it
sally
looked
over
his
shoulder
a
is
dot
dash
b
is
dash
dot
dot
dot
and
so
on
down
the
line
you
can
learn
all
that
in
about
no
time
but
receiving
takes
longer
those
birds
send
out
messages
like
greased
lightning
you
ve
got
to
think
fast
and
be
accurate
at
the
same
time
that
s
tough
but
it
s
absolutely
necessary
especially
in
your
work
to
read
a
message
wrong
skip
a
dot
here
and
miss
a
dash
there
may
sink
a
ship
or
even
a
half
dozen
oh
sally
held
her
head
that
sounds
serious
it
is
but
see
here
why
do
we
waste
a
beautiful
sunset
hour
on
code
you
ll
get
that
in
your
next
school
yes
i
know
but
i
want
it
now
it
she
hesitated
it
s
not
my
secret
alone
so
i
can
t
tell
you
too
you
don
t
have
to
tell
me
anything
he
replied
with
a
generous
smile
but
i
want
to
that
night
when
i
fell
off
the
roof
i
was
running
a
wire
from
my
room
to
the
aerial
on
the
roof
i
ve
been
working
for
a
long
time
with
a
dear
old
man
who
s
a
real
genius
he
invented
a
special
kind
of
radio
and
he
gave
me
two
of
them
to
try
i
see
that
s
what
you
re
doing
now
did
the
outside
aerial
help
oh
yes
a
whole
lot
the
come
in
a
whole
lot
more
the
what
he
stared
the
that
s
what
we
call
them
i
suppose
it
s
some
special
form
of
code
but
it
s
not
like
any
i
ve
ever
heard
on
the
short
wave
section
of
our
i
wish
you
d
tried
to
write
it
down
he
said
thoughtfully
perhaps
they
have
a
secret
code
they
may
substitute
numbers
for
letters
see
here
are
the
numbers
in
morse
code
dot
dash
dash
dot
are
for
one
for
two
you
add
two
dots
and
drop
a
dot
dash
dot
three
is
dot
dot
dot
dash
dot
and
so
that
doesn
t
sound
too
hard
interrupted
sally
it
s
simple
take
this
book
home
and
learn
the
numbers
then
listen
to
your
radio
and
try
to
write
down
the
in
dots
and
i
will
if
they
are
there
tonight
sometimes
they
re
not
there
at
all
and
sometimes
there
are
a
lot
of
them
five
six
or
a
dozen
all
talking
to
one
another
like
frogs
in
a
is
that
right
he
suddenly
became
excited
say
perhaps
they
are
in
a
pond
the
big
pond
perhaps
they
are
wolves
instead
of
wolves
sure
enemy
subs
of
them
you
know
wouldn
t
that
be
a
break
i
suppose
you
suppose
so
say
you
don
t
know
the
half
of
it
these
are
known
to
have
some
means
of
talking
to
one
another
under
the
they
d
almost
have
sure
they
would
but
all
the
bright
minds
in
europe
and
america
can
t
find
out
how
they
do
it
but
then
his
voice
dropped
probably
your
come
from
a
flight
of
planes
crossing
to
north
or
from
a
sure
we
too
have
our
secret
methods
of
communication
but
if
your
old
friend
has
invented
a
new
one
they
ll
make
him
an
it
s
up
to
me
to
prove
it
that
s
why
i
m
so
anxious
about
it
is
well
then
we
ll
really
dig
in
try
out
my
code
idea
then
we
ll
meet
again
at
sunset
it
s
a
she
left
the
lab
with
a
smile
even
if
nothing
came
of
this
code
idea
she
had
made
a
grand
friend
and
that
was
always
worth
while
late
that
evening
while
others
wrote
letters
read
or
slept
sally
gave
herself
over
once
more
to
solving
the
riddle
of
the
secret
radio
and
its
she
had
made
very
little
progress
when
the
signal
sounded
for
lights
out
oh
dear
she
sighed
no
day
is
ever
long
she
had
been
in
bed
for
a
half
hour
but
had
not
fallen
asleep
when
suddenly
she
caught
a
gleam
of
light
from
barbara
s
bed
barbara
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
the
light
blinked
out
and
barbara
s
head
came
out
from
beneath
the
covers
i
m
sorry
barbara
whispered
back
these
studies
are
so
hard
and
there
are
so
many
of
them
i
never
get
caught
up
so
i
ve
been
studying
with
a
flashlight
under
the
covers
no
one
would
know
it
but
such
determination
sally
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
you
should
have
a
medal
or
something
but
you
ll
smother
oh
no
barbara
laughed
i
m
like
a
seal
i
come
up
for
anyway
it
s
an
idea
said
sally
hopping
out
of
bed
she
gathered
in
her
precious
radio
and
with
a
bed
cover
for
a
tent
studied
the
for
another
hour
illustration
barbara
s
head
came
out
from
beneath
the
covers
the
close
of
that
hour
found
her
thoroughly
disgusted
on
a
paper
she
had
made
a
few
marks
when
she
had
compared
these
to
the
code
marks
for
letters
and
figures
they
added
up
to
exactly
nothing
terrible
she
thought
i
know
what
i
ll
do
i
ll
take
the
radio
over
to
the
lab
and
show
it
to
danny
i
m
sure
he
can
be
trusted
we
ll
work
things
out
what
s
that
black
box
danny
asked
when
she
arrived
next
evening
that
s
my
secret
radio
i
couldn
t
do
a
thing
last
night
i
want
you
to
help
it
s
nice
of
you
to
trust
he
beamed
people
have
said
i
was
simple
but
could
be
trusted
only
time
will
time
doesn
t
need
to
tell
me
i
know
do
you
well
then
that
s
fine
how
do
you
open
this
black
box
she
snapped
it
open
oh
we
need
an
aerial
there
s
one
on
this
building
much
better
than
the
one
you
ve
been
using
there
s
a
connection
over
in
the
in
a
few
minutes
the
radio
was
ready
to
operate
sally
turned
the
switches
nothing
came
out
not
a
sound
what
s
up
danny
asked
those
gremlins
subs
or
whatever
they
are
are
not
always
turn
the
dial
get
something
else
that
will
tell
us
whether
our
connections
are
there
s
nothing
else
on
the
air
for
that
s
a
queer
yes
it
is
but
if
we
wait
five
minutes
station
nancy
will
be
on
the
and
in
the
meantime
tell
me
about
parachutes
she
begged
you
ve
dropped
a
time
or
two
haven
t
you
naturally
i
m
a
how
does
it
feel
to
drop
for
the
first
time
just
fine
if
you
think
of
something
else
most
of
the
time
it
helps
to
sing
he
d
fly
through
the
air
with
the
greatest
of
ease
a
daring
young
man
on
the
flying
but
why
all
the
interest
in
parachutes
my
roommate
is
going
to
be
a
parachute
i
hope
she
s
a
careful
sort
of
lady
i
saw
a
boy
drop
two
thousand
feet
straight
down
his
rigger
had
failed
i
ll
rig
my
sally
s
lips
were
a
straight
line
why
should
you
go
in
for
parachutes
but
go
in
for
all
sorts
of
he
laughed
no
she
said
i
don
t
i
get
dizzy
but
i
promised
barbara
that
i
d
go
down
with
her
it
they
asked
her
to
try
you
did
that
takes
courage
where
s
the
war
job
that
doesn
t
oh
it
s
not
so
he
blew
an
imaginary
smoke
ring
you
just
sit
on
the
edge
of
a
hole
until
they
give
you
the
word
then
you
look
up
slide
through
the
hole
and
down
you
go
when
the
parachute
is
open
it
is
really
swell
like
dreams
we
have
of
flying
just
with
our
hands
when
you
land
you
curl
up
like
a
sleepy
kitten
roll
on
the
ground
then
get
you
make
it
sound
so
nice
why
not
sally
turned
a
knob
on
the
radio
she
snapped
on
a
headset
and
said
hello
are
you
there
then
she
listened
how
do
you
get
me
she
spoke
into
the
mouthpiece
again
good
as
ever
that
s
fine
this
is
sally
signing
off
see
she
turned
to
danny
pete
s
sake
what
do
you
use
i
don
t
what
only
one
person
in
the
world
knows
that
he
s
the
man
who
made
it
my
old
friend
all
i
know
is
it
s
very
short
watch
she
snapped
off
the
lights
then
pulled
down
the
shades
the
radio
s
tubes
glowed
red
say
a
radio
with
its
own
private
wave
length
is
worth
a
fortune
i
know
a
man
high
up
in
communications
let
me
show
it
to
not
for
you
ll
be
rich
and
no
no
oh
i
wish
i
hadn
t
brought
it
here
can
t
you
see
that
it
was
loaned
to
me
by
a
very
dear
friend
and
that
he
alone
can
release
it
yes
he
replied
soberly
i
won
t
breathe
a
word
about
it
until
you
give
me
the
thanks
she
stammered
you
really
had
me
and
now
he
said
how
about
having
another
try
at
the
of
the
gremlins
or
subs
for
ten
minutes
more
they
sat
there
in
the
dark
watching
the
red
glow
of
the
strange
radio
tubes
but
hearing
just
nothing
at
all
then
suddenly
it
came
a
low
for
a
long
time
danny
sat
there
silently
listening
it
s
code
all
right
he
murmured
once
there
s
a
sort
of
rhythm
to
it
just
as
there
is
to
all
if
you
turn
this
dial
sally
whispered
it
will
throw
them
she
turned
the
dial
silence
followed
but
not
for
long
again
came
they
re
back
he
whispered
no
that
s
another
one
listen
you
can
tell
the
she
brought
the
first
one
back
then
switched
to
the
second
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
was
all
ears
perhaps
the
put
stands
for
dot
and
for
dash
he
suggested
i
ll
just
try
it
that
might
be
the
opposite
sure
just
he
snapped
on
a
small
light
and
then
began
marking
down
dots
and
dashes
as
he
listened
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
that
might
be
it
he
breathed
at
last
it
s
hard
to
take
down
but
i
ve
got
dot
dot
dot
dash
dot
that
s
three
dash
dash
dash
for
five
and
dash
dash
dot
dot
for
seven
then
there
are
some
numbers
that
seem
like
seventeen
and
i
can
t
be
give
me
a
pencil
and
paper
she
suggested
let
me
play
the
for
a
long
time
after
that
they
listened
and
marked
down
dots
and
dashes
when
one
sender
went
off
the
air
they
switched
to
another
in
time
they
came
to
believe
that
number
one
and
number
two
were
holding
a
conversation
then
number
two
went
off
the
air
followed
by
number
one
a
little
search
found
a
third
when
number
three
went
dead
number
one
was
at
it
again
it
became
an
interesting
game
of
in
the
air
could
it
be
one
of
our
convoys
sally
asked
hardly
that
they
maintain
radio
silence
i
m
told
but
with
such
a
radio
who
knows
but
if
they
are
subs
a
whole
of
them
he
exclaimed
a
moment
later
and
if
we
could
spot
them
while
we
were
on
a
ship
an
aircraft
carrier
spot
them
some
distance
away
and
go
after
them
with
a
dozen
planes
loaded
with
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
exclaimed
becoming
greatly
excited
i
ll
be
ready
to
sail
in
a
month
or
two
on
an
aircraft
carrier
you
get
a
radio
job
on
my
ship
then
we
ll
really
try
this
radio
they
re
not
sending
waves
on
ships
yet
she
reminded
oh
we
ll
manage
it
he
insisted
we
ll
just
have
we
may
discover
that
we
re
mostly
just
duplicating
one
of
uncle
sam
s
sally
was
cautious
by
nature
these
code
signals
may
come
from
american
ships
or
tell
you
what
he
exclaimed
we
ve
just
got
to
their
messages
so
we
can
tell
what
they
say
then
we
ll
know
but
that
he
sighed
heavily
looks
like
a
long
long
they
pitched
into
that
job
once
more
and
had
been
working
for
some
time
when
he
said
by
the
way
did
you
have
a
class
tonight
yes
from
eight
to
never
mind
then
it
s
nine
oh
she
exclaimed
i
must
go
i
ll
get
a
black
mark
unhook
my
radio
and
let
me
there
you
are
he
said
a
moment
later
as
he
handed
her
the
radio
but
you
ll
be
back
oh
sure
it
s
been
exciting
just
think
what
it
will
mean
if
we
really
do
something
big
with
old
s
i
have
been
thinking
he
replied
soberly
just
keep
trying
and
mum
s
the
word
we
ll
get
there
yet
chapter
six
through
a
hole
in
the
sky
during
the
that
followed
there
were
no
more
long
night
trysts
over
the
secret
radio
sally
had
a
record
to
maintain
she
had
resolved
at
the
very
beginning
to
be
one
of
the
best
waves
ever
entrusted
with
a
job
in
communications
she
had
decided
too
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
a
spot
on
some
ship
sailing
the
seven
seas
she
knew
quite
well
that
the
best
way
to
get
what
you
want
is
to
earn
it
classes
must
always
come
first
for
all
that
she
and
danny
did
each
day
spend
one
glorious
twilight
hour
working
away
at
the
secret
radio
when
saturday
night
came
the
waves
one
free
night
nancy
joined
them
and
working
both
radios
at
once
they
really
went
places
and
did
things
using
both
radios
they
spotted
as
many
as
eight
broadcasters
of
the
mysterious
pack
on
a
single
night
are
they
really
enemy
subs
nancy
asked
who
knows
was
all
danny
would
say
if
they
are
we
ve
really
got
but
they
may
be
cargo
ships
in
a
convoy
or
airplanes
going
to
europe
said
nancy
then
why
don
t
we
ask
our
communications
people
in
washington
whether
they
are
using
that
two
good
reasons
danny
grinned
we
don
t
know
the
we
re
using
and
if
we
did
the
folks
in
washington
wouldn
t
tell
probably
send
an
agent
to
look
us
up
sally
said
no
dearie
we
ve
got
to
work
it
out
all
by
just
give
us
time
and
we
ll
make
it
danny
declared
ah
yes
there
was
the
rub
all
too
soon
the
bugle
would
blow
and
they
would
be
scattered
far
and
wide
to
new
fields
of
endeavor
they
made
some
progress
one
evening
danny
exclaimed
see
here
the
numbers
they
are
they
are
all
odd
seven
seventeen
there
s
not
an
even
number
in
the
that
narrows
it
down
said
sally
it
sure
two
evenings
later
sally
made
a
more
important
discovery
look
she
jumped
to
her
feet
in
her
excitement
to
point
at
a
row
of
numbers
not
one
of
them
is
evenly
divisible
seven
seventeen
every
last
one
of
them
does
that
mean
anything
it
may
mean
a
lot
was
danny
s
excited
comment
oh
there
s
the
bell
she
exclaimed
time
for
class
think
of
dropping
this
discovery
just
like
it
s
not
danny
dragged
out
a
tall
stack
of
papers
i
ll
still
be
working
on
that
when
you
re
fast
danny
you
re
a
treasure
she
exclaimed
giving
his
hand
a
quick
squeeze
it
s
all
part
of
the
game
he
grinned
we
ll
be
famous
both
of
us
and
your
old
friend
as
the
hour
was
striking
midnight
when
at
last
danny
stacked
the
papers
in
a
neat
pile
got
it
he
breathed
it
s
the
berries
can
t
be
any
mistake
about
that
we
re
really
making
progress
but
we
ve
still
got
a
long
way
to
that
very
night
one
more
major
problem
brought
sally
s
radio
experimentation
to
an
abrupt
halt
she
returned
to
her
room
after
her
late
hour
of
study
to
find
barbara
sitting
in
her
bed
staring
gloomily
at
the
floor
what
s
the
matter
she
asked
been
caught
out
of
bounds
or
something
i
haven
t
done
a
thing
barbara
replied
gloomily
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
did
when
you
never
step
off
the
beaten
path
just
plug
along
day
by
day
people
ask
you
to
do
such
terrible
why
what
have
they
asked
you
to
do
now
it
s
that
parachute
barbara
stared
gloomily
at
her
feet
they
say
it
s
not
really
required
that
a
parachute
rigger
should
take
parachute
training
but
that
if
they
do
take
it
and
if
they
do
take
just
one
drop
they
make
better
of
course
they
do
sally
agreed
they
know
what
it
s
all
that
sounds
all
right
but
would
you
want
to
go
to
an
airfield
where
only
men
are
training
and
go
through
all
the
practice
and
finally
take
the
drop
all
by
yourself
no
of
course
not
are
they
asking
you
to
do
that
not
asking
just
which
in
this
war
is
the
same
thing
tell
you
sally
came
to
a
sudden
decision
if
lieutenant
mayfare
will
let
me
i
ll
go
through
the
training
with
you
wouldn
t
barbara
stared
i
said
i
would
didn
t
i
yes
but
you
don
t
have
no
of
course
not
but
i
want
to
if
i
m
to
go
in
for
radio
and
communications
i
want
to
be
prepared
to
serve
anywhere
on
land
on
the
sea
or
in
the
illustration
barbara
was
staring
gloomily
at
the
floor
you
re
the
daffiest
person
i
ever
the
dandiest
at
that
big
barbara
hugged
sally
until
she
thought
her
ribs
would
crack
but
sally
you
don
t
have
to
go
in
for
parachute
jumping
if
you
re
going
in
for
radio
lieutenant
mayfare
protested
when
sally
made
her
unusual
request
next
day
but
i
want
to
sally
insisted
you
re
doing
it
to
help
barbara
is
that
fair
to
yourself
who
knows
what
is
fair
sally
asked
quietly
it
s
not
fair
to
ask
a
boy
to
give
up
his
college
work
right
in
the
middle
of
his
first
year
to
go
to
war
or
is
it
it
s
not
fair
to
ask
a
father
to
leave
two
small
children
for
the
same
reason
or
is
it
who
anyway
i
d
like
the
experience
she
added
after
a
brief
silence
there
are
several
things
we
are
not
being
asked
to
do
now
perhaps
tomorrow
or
next
month
we
will
be
asked
i
want
to
be
prepared
and
after
all
i
think
it
s
a
small
not
so
the
officer
spoke
slowly
you
ll
have
to
spend
the
last
half
of
every
afternoon
for
a
week
preparing
for
it
of
course
she
added
your
work
here
has
been
excellent
the
time
lost
will
not
matter
so
much
then
i
may
do
it
sally
exclaimed
eagerly
yes
you
may
oh
thank
you
thank
you
a
lot
it
is
barbara
who
should
be
thankful
i
doubt
if
she
could
take
the
test
she
couldn
t
sally
agreed
barbara
is
a
fine
girl
she
s
true
blue
there
are
not
many
things
she
could
do
in
our
organization
for
parachute
rigging
she
s
that
s
and
i
want
her
to
be
a
great
with
your
help
i
m
sure
she
will
be
you
and
she
may
start
your
training
this
afternoon
the
sooner
the
better
there
s
not
much
time
and
that
is
why
danny
duke
had
to
wait
so
long
to
tell
sally
of
his
grand
discoveries
that
afternoon
sally
and
barbara
rode
five
miles
to
the
training
field
with
six
boys
who
were
to
take
the
same
training
pipe
the
girls
one
fellow
called
when
they
were
first
sighted
shut
up
another
boy
exclaimed
low
if
they
are
going
to
take
to
the
chutes
it
s
not
just
for
fun
it
really
takes
guts
if
they
ve
got
what
it
takes
you
have
to
hand
it
to
ever
run
a
children
s
playground
the
director
asked
sally
yes
once
quite
a
while
well
this
is
just
another
one
of
them
only
difference
is
you
swing
on
your
chute
straps
just
to
get
used
to
them
instead
of
from
the
old
apple
tree
and
if
you
don
t
fasten
your
straps
just
right
you
get
a
good
and
you
learn
by
bumps
sally
laughed
yes
and
that
way
you
don
t
get
killed
it
s
the
same
way
with
the
slide
the
instructor
added
it
s
just
a
kid
s
slide
only
longer
and
you
fall
is
if
you
don
t
relax
after
that
for
a
full
two
girls
practiced
swinging
sliding
tumbling
whirling
round
and
round
i
feel
as
if
i
d
been
put
in
a
cement
mixer
and
whirled
round
and
round
a
thousand
times
sally
confided
to
danny
on
saturday
afternoon
but
i
do
believe
that
barbara
will
go
through
with
it
monday
is
our
zero
hour
we
drop
at
dusk
and
i
m
keeping
my
fingers
i
ll
say
a
prayer
for
you
danny
grinned
and
now
about
this
secret
code
of
the
gremlins
the
enemy
subs
or
what
have
sally
exclaimed
eagerly
what
did
you
find
out
a
whole
lot
and
yet
not
half
enough
come
over
just
after
chow
if
you
can
bring
the
radios
and
i
ll
tell
you
oh
no
surely
not
that
much
sally
held
up
her
hands
in
mock
horror
all
the
same
i
ll
be
there
it
s
like
this
danny
said
as
they
sat
before
the
radio
that
night
listening
to
the
they
ve
made
their
code
from
numbers
that
can
be
divided
evenly
i
m
sure
of
that
but
does
one
stand
for
the
letter
a
or
have
they
arranged
it
all
backwards
they
may
have
started
in
the
middle
and
gone
both
yes
but
i
don
t
think
they
did
why
should
they
they
had
the
all
to
themselves
why
not
have
a
simple
code
i
even
think
they
let
one
stand
for
a
three
for
b
five
for
c
and
so
what
makes
you
think
that
because
eleven
which
should
stand
for
e
is
used
more
times
than
any
other
number
and
e
is
the
letter
in
the
alphabet
other
vowels
stand
out
in
the
same
proportion
so
i
think
we
ve
got
that
far
but
now
he
sighed
we
ve
got
to
find
out
whether
they
re
sending
in
german
or
english
that
is
going
to
be
and
must
be
continued
in
our
there
was
a
suggestion
of
gloom
in
sally
s
voice
she
was
tired
and
sore
much
lay
ahead
monday
we
drop
from
that
hole
in
the
sky
tuesday
we
take
our
finals
she
sighed
and
wednesday
you
scatter
he
supplied
i
got
that
on
good
authority
some
of
you
go
to
other
schools
and
some
to
work
depending
on
what
you
re
taking
that
s
about
it
we
ll
just
have
to
work
and
hope
we
meet
again
over
this
blessed
tantalizing
mesmerizing
radio
she
laughed
and
now
what
do
you
say
we
take
the
radio
over
to
my
house
and
then
make
a
night
of
it
and
that
was
just
what
they
did
monday
afternoon
came
and
with
it
many
a
breath
sally
i
m
scared
barbara
whispered
as
they
piled
into
the
car
that
was
to
take
them
on
their
last
trip
to
the
field
you
wouldn
t
be
natural
if
you
weren
t
was
the
cheering
response
all
the
same
try
to
forget
in
the
week
that
had
passed
the
eight
of
them
two
girls
and
six
boys
had
formed
the
habit
of
singing
on
the
way
out
now
when
at
last
they
rolled
away
a
youthful
voice
struck
up
he
d
fly
through
the
air
with
the
greatest
of
ease
a
daring
young
man
on
the
flying
trapeze
where
have
i
heard
that
before
another
boy
groaned
for
all
that
they
sang
it
with
gusto
sailing
sailing
over
the
bounding
main
came
next
then
the
boy
from
kentucky
started
the
sun
shines
bright
on
my
old
kentucky
his
voice
broke
on
the
second
line
sally
swallowed
hard
but
they
sang
it
through
to
the
end
ioway
ioway
shouted
the
boy
from
the
midwest
that
s
where
the
tall
corn
they
all
laughed
but
when
the
strains
of
swanee
river
came
rolling
out
they
were
in
a
mellow
mood
once
more
when
they
arrived
at
the
field
they
found
a
captive
balloon
straining
at
its
ropes
beneath
it
hung
a
platform
and
at
the
very
center
of
the
platform
was
a
round
hole
that
said
sally
is
the
famous
hole
in
the
on
fields
where
paratroops
are
trained
we
have
towers
to
jump
from
but
they
cost
a
pile
of
money
a
balloon
works
just
as
well
a
friendly
lieutenant
explained
sure
even
better
wisecracked
the
boy
from
kentucky
then
if
you
don
t
feel
like
dropping
off
you
can
just
cut
the
rope
and
go
for
a
balloon
i
m
in
favor
of
a
balloon
ride
right
now
said
his
pal
a
latticework
of
ropes
formed
a
wall
about
the
platform
over
this
they
climbed
then
slowly
majestically
the
balloon
rose
skyward
once
sailing
sailing
rang
out
on
the
air
old
kentucky
home
was
a
little
too
much
this
time
it
expired
in
the
middle
of
the
second
verse
pack
up
your
troubles
went
very
well
and
the
man
on
the
flying
trapeze
was
as
popular
as
ever
one
big
fellow
they
called
samson
sat
hunched
up
in
a
corner
not
singing
and
saying
nothing
what
s
the
matter
scared
sally
asked
thunder
no
he
exploded
sleepy
that
s
all
what
s
a
little
parachute
jump
if
you
d
grown
up
on
a
cattle
ranch
with
the
big
bulls
chasin
you
and
the
lonesome
coyotes
callin
you
wouldn
t
mind
i
fell
off
a
mountain
once
and
no
parachute
stopped
me
just
a
pine
i
m
scared
barbara
whispered
sally
made
no
reply
truth
was
her
stomach
was
pumping
in
a
strange
way
she
saw
the
boy
from
kentucky
gulp
twice
that
didn
t
help
any
we
re
about
there
the
instructor
announced
if
your
stomachs
don
t
feel
good
forget
it
that
s
the
way
mine
feels
right
now
and
i
ve
jumped
three
hundred
times
now
remember
he
added
when
you
slide
off
keep
looking
up
that
way
your
chin
doesn
t
hook
on
the
parachute
straps
now
he
said
in
a
strong
clear
voice
we
re
here
see
that
green
light
that
s
the
signal
don
t
be
nervous
your
parachutes
have
been
properly
rigged
i
watched
it
done
don
t
forget
i
ll
be
right
behind
before
they
went
up
they
had
been
given
numbers
barbara
s
number
was
seven
sally
s
eight
that
meant
that
except
for
the
instructor
they
would
be
last
sally
did
not
know
whether
this
was
good
or
bad
for
barbara
to
go
first
would
be
terrible
but
would
watching
the
others
disappear
wear
away
her
slender
thread
of
courage
she
could
only
hope
that
it
would
not
action
stations
the
instructor
snapped
number
one
the
big
fellow
raised
on
a
cattle
ranch
took
his
place
dangling
his
feet
over
the
hole
with
his
arms
hanging
straight
down
he
looked
up
number
one
the
big
fellow
vanished
into
the
thin
air
below
number
two
one
more
vanished
sally
s
throat
went
dry
number
three
there
they
went
number
four
oppressive
silence
followed
sally
gasped
had
something
gone
wrong
then
she
remembered
they
were
to
go
down
by
fours
with
a
space
between
each
group
two
fast
sticks
they
called
it
she
felt
quite
like
a
stick
just
then
unconsciously
she
began
to
two
three
four
she
mopped
her
brow
she
dared
not
look
at
barbara
five
six
she
had
reached
fifteen
when
the
instructor
took
up
the
counting
once
more
number
one
more
man
vanished
get
ready
sally
whispered
on
barbara
s
face
was
a
look
of
number
the
last
boy
vanished
barbara
slid
into
her
place
her
hands
were
at
her
sides
her
chin
high
when
she
heard
number
seven
she
slid
from
sight
in
her
eagerness
to
follow
sally
nearly
went
down
without
an
order
as
it
was
she
sank
breathlessly
down
until
with
startling
suddenness
she
felt
a
pull
at
her
straps
and
knew
her
parachute
had
opened
good
old
chute
she
murmured
as
she
glanced
up
to
catch
its
white
gleam
against
the
sky
she
looked
for
barbara
yes
there
she
was
off
to
the
left
floating
down
with
the
greatest
of
ease
this
was
barbara
s
big
moment
perhaps
the
biggest
moment
of
all
her
life
illustration
good
old
chute
sally
murmured
but
here
was
a
voice
coming
up
from
below
you
re
coming
down
nicely
number
seven
it
said
that
would
be
barbara
number
four
bend
those
knees
don
t
be
trying
to
land
stiff
it
was
the
voice
again
an
instructor
was
talking
through
a
loudspeaker
his
voice
carried
up
to
them
perfectly
number
eight
he
called
oh
he
s
calling
me
sally
thought
in
sudden
panic
number
eight
you
must
turn
round
reach
up
grab
the
sally
obeyed
she
swung
half
about
that
s
it
always
land
with
the
wind
not
against
it
now
all
of
you
knees
bent
feet
together
relax
relax
for
a
one
by
one
they
tumbled
on
the
ground
then
jumped
up
laughing
sally
made
a
quick
count
yes
all
eight
were
up
and
moving
then
having
unfastened
her
parachute
she
rushed
over
to
barbara
to
exclaim
barbara
you
were
wonderful
throwing
her
arms
about
her
barbara
burst
into
tears
of
joy
when
the
shower
had
passed
she
exclaimed
now
i
am
going
to
be
a
parachute
rigger
always
for
i
know
just
how
much
it
means
boy
oh
boy
sally
exclaimed
when
at
last
she
was
alone
with
her
instructor
i
hope
i
get
a
chance
to
make
use
of
that
experience
that
certainly
was
something
it
s
been
my
experience
he
replied
soberly
that
in
this
war
sooner
or
later
we
find
a
place
for
every
bit
of
practice
we
ve
ever
had
your
time
will
would
it
sally
wondered
a
long
long
wonder
she
was
still
wondering
when
she
got
back
to
school
secret
radios
ships
airplanes
parachutes
all
went
round
and
round
in
her
head
what
was
in
store
for
her
in
a
day
or
two
she
would
be
whirled
away
to
another
school
for
further
training
and
after
that
what
she
asked
the
elm
that
had
once
saved
her
from
disaster
the
elm
whispered
to
the
breeze
but
she
could
not
understand
what
the
tree
and
the
breezes
were
saying
chapter
seven
silent
storm
and
then
like
autumn
leaves
caught
in
a
miniature
whirlwind
they
were
sent
spinning
away
in
all
directions
there
was
one
happy
evening
hour
when
sally
nancy
barbara
and
danny
had
lunch
together
in
the
purple
cow
just
off
the
campus
theirs
was
the
of
good
fellows
well
met
of
soldiers
who
might
never
meet
again
and
yet
behind
all
their
jokes
and
laughter
was
a
feeling
of
friendship
and
devotion
to
one
another
that
in
all
the
years
could
never
die
we
ll
be
seeing
you
they
shouted
next
morning
oh
sure
we
ll
be
together
again
sooner
than
you
think
sally
and
nancy
were
sent
to
the
beautiful
campus
of
a
great
university
where
they
would
learn
much
more
about
radio
and
communications
barbara
was
shipped
off
to
a
big
airport
to
receive
her
final
training
in
the
art
of
rigging
parachutes
danny
remained
behind
but
not
for
long
the
autumn
winds
would
soon
whisk
him
away
to
new
fields
of
adventure
and
duty
both
sally
and
nancy
had
dreamed
of
attending
some
truly
great
university
and
at
last
here
they
were
but
for
how
long
just
long
enough
to
make
you
efficient
in
your
chosen
field
was
the
precise
answer
and
always
remember
your
services
are
badly
needed
right
now
good
communications
and
radio
men
are
scarce
they
are
badly
needed
but
won
t
we
two
be
sent
overseas
nancy
asked
of
the
major
who
gave
them
the
information
that
remains
to
be
seen
however
one
thing
is
certain
no
wave
will
be
sent
overseas
until
she
has
perfected
herself
in
her
particular
branch
and
has
served
long
enough
at
one
of
our
bases
here
in
america
to
prove
that
she
will
be
a
valuable
addition
to
our
navy
either
aboard
ship
or
right
here
is
where
i
forget
this
gothic
architecture
the
shady
walks
the
cozy
nooks
that
help
to
make
this
big
school
what
it
is
sally
said
as
a
look
of
determination
spread
over
her
face
i
m
going
to
work
and
study
day
and
night
for
we
are
in
the
navy
i
m
right
behind
you
nancy
agreed
all
the
same
when
this
terrible
scrap
is
over
i
m
coming
right
back
here
and
be
a
regular
student
as
long
as
i
please
and
believe
me
i
m
going
to
have
all
the
dances
proms
shady
walks
and
all
the
shake
on
sally
held
out
her
hand
that
handshake
was
a
solemn
ceremony
and
now
to
from
that
time
on
their
heads
were
bent
for
long
hours
over
study
desks
radios
clattering
keys
their
day
was
not
done
when
darkness
fell
nor
their
week
when
saturday
rolled
round
they
did
not
like
barbara
hide
under
the
covers
to
study
with
a
flashlight
when
night
came
they
rented
bicycles
for
the
entire
period
of
their
stay
at
the
university
on
many
a
night
farmers
saw
strange
lights
winking
and
blinking
from
one
hill
to
another
in
their
pastures
sally
and
nancy
were
practicing
the
code
they
had
studied
that
day
twice
they
were
reported
as
spies
but
nothing
came
of
it
for
they
never
returned
to
the
same
pasture
twice
and
it
would
have
been
a
farm
boy
who
could
have
rounded
them
up
in
the
dark
saturday
afternoon
armed
with
dozens
of
multicolored
flags
they
returned
to
these
same
hills
to
practice
flag
signals
white
and
blue
with
a
notch
in
the
end
stood
for
a
blue
white
red
white
and
blue
in
stripes
was
c
and
so
on
and
on
to
white
with
a
red
spot
for
one
blue
with
a
white
spot
for
two
and
so
on
with
good
memories
and
a
zeal
for
learning
seldom
witnessed
by
those
gray
stone
walls
they
went
through
the
school
in
record
time
and
were
once
more
on
the
move
now
we
re
really
going
to
work
sally
cried
enthusiastically
yes
and
at
one
of
the
biggest
air
bases
on
our
long
seacoast
nancy
agreed
florida
and
the
sea
sally
breathed
that
s
worth
working
it
sure
is
there
s
something
else
i
m
going
to
work
harder
than
ever
sally
spoke
with
conviction
what
s
that
i
m
going
to
try
to
cut
florida
and
the
sea
down
to
just
the
good
old
all
my
life
i
ve
waited
for
oh
i
don
t
know
there
are
the
enemy
they
re
really
dangerous
the
water
s
awfully
that
s
just
sally
s
eyes
shone
there
are
the
haven
t
forgotten
our
secret
radios
almost
nancy
admitted
i
tried
them
twice
back
at
the
u
when
you
were
gone
sally
confided
nothing
doing
guess
we
were
too
far
from
the
florida
will
be
much
better
but
the
sea
will
be
better
i
suppose
so
nancy
replied
dreamily
but
don
t
forget
your
enemy
may
turn
out
to
be
friendly
ships
or
i
won
t
forget
all
the
same
i
want
to
wonder
where
danny
and
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
had
a
letter
from
barbara
this
morning
guess
where
she
is
now
where
we
re
going
that
s
just
where
she
is
won
t
it
be
great
if
you
can
hop
off
from
the
sky
with
her
again
nancy
laughed
i
wouldn
t
mind
i
ll
bet
you
an
soda
i
ll
have
a
chance
to
use
that
experience
before
the
year
is
easy
aces
you
re
on
if
i
never
win
another
bet
that
s
one
for
was
nancy
too
confident
in
this
world
at
war
many
strange
things
can
happen
and
many
do
not
so
long
after
that
sally
found
herself
seated
on
the
top
of
a
high
tower
that
overlooked
a
vast
airfield
the
skies
were
full
of
floating
planes
the
roar
of
powerful
motors
beat
upon
her
eardrums
in
her
hand
she
held
a
score
sheet
and
at
the
steady
carefully
spoken
words
of
a
marine
in
a
major
s
uniform
she
recorded
hours
moments
numbers
and
names
on
the
officer
s
head
was
a
set
of
earphones
about
his
neck
a
was
attached
from
time
to
time
speaking
always
in
that
steady
even
tone
he
said
come
on
down
six
four
three
wind
velocity
fifteen
miles
per
hour
and
again
circle
once
more
fast
one
coming
in
from
the
there
were
long
periods
of
time
when
he
said
nothing
just
stood
there
staring
dreamily
away
toward
the
sea
but
always
he
appeared
to
listen
as
indeed
he
did
for
listening
to
the
radio
voice
of
great
bombers
inviting
them
to
come
in
advising
them
to
wait
telling
them
when
to
take
off
informing
them
regarding
weather
was
his
duty
and
on
his
ears
eyes
and
voice
hung
the
life
of
many
a
fine
young
flier
red
storm
his
fellow
officers
called
him
some
times
silent
his
real
name
was
robert
storm
silent
storm
was
the
name
sally
liked
best
although
of
course
she
never
called
him
that
always
major
storm
he
seemed
young
for
a
major
and
certainly
was
handsome
in
a
big
tall
way
he
seldom
spoke
to
her
except
to
instruct
her
in
her
work
he
was
teaching
her
his
own
work
so
she
could
take
his
place
nancy
too
was
learning
the
work
but
at
a
different
period
as
major
storm
stood
there
looking
away
during
quiet
times
she
often
wondered
about
that
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
then
too
there
was
the
long
scar
across
his
right
cheek
and
the
look
of
utter
weariness
that
came
over
his
face
at
times
when
he
slumped
down
in
his
chair
major
storm
she
said
one
day
speaking
with
a
sudden
impulse
that
surprised
her
what
does
one
do
to
make
people
want
one
as
a
friend
you
don
t
make
people
want
you
as
a
friend
was
his
quick
reply
they
either
wish
to
be
your
friend
or
they
don
t
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
you
sure
she
asked
a
little
startled
well
then
they
might
not
care
to
have
you
as
a
friend
but
you
might
be
able
to
do
something
that
would
make
them
wish
to
do
something
for
know
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
the
answer
to
that
is
simple
then
take
an
interest
in
them
first
find
out
about
their
lives
their
families
their
problems
have
a
sympathetic
interest
in
them
if
they
re
human
they
ll
do
the
same
for
you
that
s
simple
isn
t
it
very
suddenly
he
spoke
in
a
different
tone
come
on
in
after
sweeping
the
sky
with
his
binoculars
he
settled
down
in
his
chair
that
radio
boy
on
that
big
bomber
is
johnny
one
of
my
own
boys
i
taught
him
he
s
a
fine
boy
i
suppose
the
war
will
get
him
sooner
or
later
it
seems
rather
useless
to
care
for
them
too
much
they
go
away
you
never
see
them
that
s
but
by
the
way
his
voice
rose
you
have
one
very
good
friend
eminently
worth
while
i
d
i
have
several
she
smiled
she
was
happy
happier
than
she
had
been
for
days
she
had
really
started
silent
storm
talking
but
then
she
thought
with
a
shy
smile
who
ever
heard
of
a
really
truly
silent
storm
anyway
this
friend
of
yours
he
said
quietly
is
also
a
very
old
friend
of
we
used
to
call
you
don
t
mean
kennedy
she
stared
in
disbelief
that
s
exactly
who
i
do
mean
he
taught
me
most
of
what
i
know
about
radio
he
s
one
man
in
a
oh
she
exclaimed
then
we
re
practically
cousins
something
like
that
he
replied
dryly
then
springing
to
his
feet
he
said
in
and
that
was
all
for
then
evening
was
coming
on
many
big
ships
were
coming
in
through
the
blue
every
moment
was
taken
from
then
to
the
end
of
the
shift
yes
that
was
all
for
then
but
it
was
enough
to
keep
the
girl
dreaming
in
the
golden
twilight
under
the
palms
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
and
those
were
strange
dreams
secret
radios
ships
submarines
giant
bombers
old
and
silent
storm
were
all
there
in
one
glorious
mixup
of
lights
and
shadows
chapter
eight
danger
is
my
duty
since
there
were
many
waves
stationed
at
this
great
air
and
marine
base
they
had
taken
over
a
very
fine
little
hotel
down
by
the
sea
nancy
this
is
gorgeous
sally
had
exclaimed
on
their
arrival
if
it
weren
t
for
the
secret
radio
i
would
be
glad
to
stay
here
until
the
war
is
it
wonderful
nancy
replied
thoughtfully
florida
the
blue
blue
sea
and
these
lovely
quarters
it
s
really
hard
to
believe
but
you
know
this
isn
t
the
sort
of
thing
i
joined
up
for
i
expected
a
truly
hard
life
the
boys
in
the
jungles
of
those
south
sea
islands
and
on
the
sandy
deserts
of
don
t
have
it
easy
so
why
should
that
s
right
was
the
quick
response
if
all
the
people
of
america
especially
those
who
have
lived
soft
i
don
t
mean
who
don
t
those
who
have
had
all
they
want
always
always
slept
in
a
soft
bed
and
always
gone
for
a
long
ride
in
the
old
bus
on
a
sunday
afternoon
could
really
be
dragged
out
of
it
all
and
have
it
good
and
tough
for
a
while
wouldn
t
it
be
grand
but
then
sally
added
in
a
quieter
voice
we
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
all
this
beauty
and
comfort
for
something
tells
me
that
it
won
t
last
too
after
her
first
real
talk
with
major
storm
sally
returned
to
her
hotel
ate
her
dinner
then
returning
to
her
room
dragged
out
her
secret
radio
she
had
barely
started
thumbing
its
dials
when
a
phone
call
announced
a
caller
hurrying
down
to
the
hotel
lobby
she
barely
refrained
from
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of
this
guest
danny
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
here
taking
a
little
final
training
and
waiting
for
a
ship
he
whispered
what
kind
of
ship
danny
ah
ah
he
held
up
a
finger
loose
talk
may
sink
a
oh
i
m
sorry
then
how
about
our
radio
may
we
talk
about
that
not
only
may
but
must
i
ve
studied
those
records
from
their
code
messages
they
re
really
revealing
that
s
why
i
i
just
got
out
the
radio
but
danny
you
re
not
allowed
in
my
illustration
danny
what
are
you
doing
here
of
course
not
but
we
re
both
allowed
in
the
radio
experimental
station
providing
one
of
us
has
a
friend
there
which
i
have
so
what
are
we
waiting
for
sure
what
ll
be
right
sally
was
off
for
the
radio
we
ll
have
such
an
aerial
as
you
never
dreamed
of
over
at
the
station
he
confided
once
they
were
on
their
way
we
ll
bring
those
enemy
subs
up
so
close
we
can
practically
talk
to
danny
she
whispered
do
you
really
think
they
were
enemy
subs
we
were
hearing
well
he
hesitated
i
d
hate
to
say
i
am
sure
of
it
but
i
ve
studied
that
secret
code
so
carefully
that
i
am
positive
that
it
goes
the
way
we
thought
it
but
the
language
is
it
english
or
german
yes
he
replied
thoughtfully
that
s
the
real
question
i
got
out
my
old
german
dictionary
and
gave
it
a
really
good
workout
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
s
a
lot
easier
to
make
sense
out
of
those
code
messages
in
german
than
it
is
in
oh
danny
you
are
wonderful
she
pressed
his
arm
just
think
what
a
glorious
victory
it
will
be
if
we
succeed
in
listening
to
the
message
of
those
when
no
one
else
has
done
it
boy
oh
boy
what
a
triumph
for
old
yes
i
suppose
danny
you
ve
never
met
him
that
s
too
but
i
ve
met
fact
once
i
actually
caught
you
he
laughed
danny
today
i
talked
with
my
boss
major
storm
and
he
told
me
old
taught
him
radio
he
says
is
one
man
in
a
million
isn
t
that
a
great
break
i
suppose
so
but
why
because
if
i
want
a
chance
to
do
something
different
like
going
to
sea
so
i
can
try
out
this
radio
if
i
tell
him
it
s
really
for
old
silent
storm
will
help
silent
storm
what
a
name
danny
laughed
low
it
s
not
the
name
that
counts
but
the
man
and
think
he
s
going
to
be
sure
sure
i
know
he
will
danny
agreed
and
now
here
s
the
in
a
small
room
they
set
up
the
radio
and
having
attached
it
to
the
aerial
connections
turned
on
the
current
almost
at
once
there
came
the
of
a
code
message
ah
got
em
danny
breathed
and
it
s
so
much
louder
so
much
more
distinct
sally
was
delighted
danny
scarcely
heard
for
he
was
busy
recording
dots
and
dashes
soon
sally
was
at
it
too
for
by
now
she
too
could
read
code
very
well
from
time
to
time
however
by
turning
that
certain
dial
she
switched
from
one
sender
to
another
she
located
six
in
all
but
even
as
they
continued
to
listen
and
record
there
came
a
change
at
first
the
messages
were
sent
in
a
slow
methodical
manner
but
now
they
came
in
close
together
excited
irregular
and
jerky
at
the
same
time
they
appeared
to
draw
closer
to
one
another
danny
dropped
his
pencil
once
i
watched
a
pack
of
wolves
chase
an
old
and
disabled
moose
their
barks
and
howls
were
just
like
this
radio
business
we
re
hearing
at
first
there
was
the
regular
yap
yap
of
the
chase
but
when
they
closed
in
they
became
greatly
excited
their
barks
howling
and
snarls
came
from
excited
minds
and
bloodthirsty
throats
they
were
in
for
the
as
sally
listened
she
seemed
to
see
six
subs
closing
in
on
a
ship
carrying
supplies
of
food
guns
or
ammunition
to
our
soldiers
in
africa
and
at
the
end
caught
the
excited
of
their
radios
as
they
closed
in
for
the
kill
perhaps
tomorrow
we
will
hear
on
the
radio
of
another
ship
sunk
off
our
shore
she
whispered
hoarsely
who
knows
was
the
sober
reply
tonight
they
seem
very
danny
we
must
hurry
she
gripped
his
hand
we
must
learn
more
i
must
go
to
sea
somehow
i
must
i
am
sure
that
will
help
most
of
perhaps
you
will
go
was
his
quiet
reply
the
next
afternoon
as
she
worked
at
her
highly
important
if
slightly
tiring
task
of
bringing
in
the
big
planes
only
to
send
them
out
again
sally
said
major
storm
why
is
that
faraway
look
on
your
face
why
he
gave
her
a
sharp
look
is
it
noticeable
thanks
for
telling
me
i
shall
discipline
my
is
it
so
terribly
bad
to
want
to
be
in
one
place
when
you
are
serving
in
another
she
asked
rather
bad
was
the
slow
reply
we
do
not
always
give
our
best
that
way
do
you
want
to
be
in
some
other
place
he
asked
abruptly
just
now
she
stammered
taken
aback
but
sometime
not
too
far
away
i
d
like
to
be
transferred
to
a
fighting
why
ships
are
danger
is
my
she
felt
that
she
was
quoting
someone
but
could
not
recall
where
she
had
heard
those
words
before
danger
is
my
duty
he
repeated
after
her
that
s
rather
good
but
you
haven
t
answered
my
question
danger
can
t
be
an
end
you
i
have
a
secret
was
the
odd
reply
i
m
told
that
most
young
ladies
of
your
age
have
several
not
important
ones
this
one
may
be
of
great
importance
it
has
to
do
with
our
mutual
friend
oh
then
it
is
important
he
exclaimed
tell
me
about
is
if
you
are
free
to
do
i
m
sure
he
would
tell
you
at
least
part
of
it
if
he
were
here
he
has
invented
a
new
radio
that
operates
on
a
secret
wave
length
i
think
the
enemy
operate
on
that
same
the
enemy
he
stared
wait
there
s
a
plane
come
in
let
s
not
talk
about
this
now
he
suggested
it
s
too
vital
we
might
become
absorbed
in
it
and
neglect
our
duty
commit
a
tragic
blunder
suppose
you
have
dinner
at
my
house
tonight
it
s
quite
proper
my
sister
lives
with
sally
found
herself
strangely
excited
i
ll
call
for
you
at
i
ll
be
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
was
pure
routine
but
sally
s
mind
wandered
often
to
thoughts
of
that
dinner
date
much
may
come
of
that
very
very
much
she
told
herself
more
than
once
chapter
nine
sally
steps
out
the
place
sally
and
silent
storm
entered
a
few
hours
later
was
a
bungalow
hidden
among
the
trees
the
windows
were
small
and
high
no
chance
for
spying
here
sally
thought
to
herself
they
were
met
at
the
door
by
a
tall
handsome
lady
who
sally
did
not
need
to
be
told
was
silent
storm
s
sister
she
appeared
to
take
sally
to
her
heart
at
once
robert
has
often
spoken
of
you
she
said
in
a
friendly
manner
oh
has
he
sally
was
a
little
surprised
she
had
thought
of
herself
as
just
one
more
of
those
waves
they
sat
down
to
a
delightful
dinner
salad
made
from
fruit
just
taken
from
the
trees
delicious
crabmeat
fried
sea
bass
hot
corn
bread
sweet
potatoes
and
coffee
a
great
for
three
cups
apiece
dinner
over
miss
storm
took
up
some
knitting
that
lay
in
a
chair
and
settled
down
by
herself
because
she
knew
her
brother
wished
it
and
she
had
sensed
that
there
was
some
serious
business
in
the
air
it
s
not
that
my
sister
can
not
be
trusted
silent
storm
half
apologized
when
he
and
sally
were
seated
in
a
small
secret
den
quite
evidently
all
his
own
she
is
to
be
trusted
completely
however
it
is
a
rule
of
war
that
a
military
secret
is
to
be
shared
with
no
outsider
and
the
thing
you
were
about
to
tell
me
up
there
in
the
tower
is
something
of
a
military
it
might
she
hesitated
it
s
really
kennedy
s
secret
he
confided
it
to
me
because
he
hoped
he
could
trust
and
he
yes
that
s
right
he
is
a
wonderful
man
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
but
such
an
invention
should
be
of
great
service
to
our
he
thought
it
might
be
he
wasn
t
so
he
wanted
it
tried
out
i
see
tell
me
only
what
you
think
he
would
like
to
have
me
lighting
his
pipe
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
i
have
very
little
curiosity
left
in
me
he
went
on
i
ve
seen
too
much
for
that
i
m
interested
in
only
one
thing
to
see
this
war
brought
to
a
successful
end
i
have
many
fine
friends
back
he
swept
the
west
with
his
hand
i
shall
never
be
able
to
go
back
to
them
but
i
can
serve
where
i
then
you
have
already
seen
sally
s
eyes
lighted
plenty
of
it
too
much
i
was
at
pearl
harbor
a
flier
and
i
was
in
about
all
that
came
after
in
the
next
seven
months
then
a
smart
jap
got
me
in
the
oh
she
breathed
it
wasn
t
so
much
i
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
a
month
but
my
spine
will
never
be
the
same
i
was
once
a
swimmer
something
of
a
champion
that
s
all
over
too
but
it
doesn
t
matter
what
really
hurts
is
that
i
can
t
get
back
to
help
finish
what
my
friends
and
i
started
over
and
you
don
t
fly
any
more
that
seemed
a
terrible
fate
to
sally
oh
yes
he
smiled
i
have
a
fast
little
and
sometimes
i
haunt
the
sky
chasing
seagulls
and
wild
a
sounds
a
bit
it
s
not
really
you
see
i
don
t
trust
myself
too
much
there
s
always
the
chance
something
might
go
wrong
with
you
yes
i
m
not
willing
to
take
a
chance
with
other
people
s
lives
but
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
that
he
changed
the
subject
abruptly
yes
it
s
the
most
remarkable
invention
launching
at
once
into
her
theme
she
talked
for
an
hour
from
time
to
time
he
interrupted
to
ask
a
question
his
pipe
went
out
twice
he
tried
to
light
it
and
failed
then
he
gave
it
up
at
last
she
spread
a
pile
of
papers
covered
with
dots
and
dashes
on
the
table
these
were
the
records
of
the
broadcast
which
she
and
danny
had
kept
after
that
for
a
half
hour
their
heads
were
bent
over
these
records
this
he
said
at
last
after
his
pipe
promises
to
be
something
of
great
importance
i
wish
you
could
stay
with
me
on
the
he
added
after
a
moment
both
you
and
nancy
are
working
in
very
well
you
could
relieve
me
of
much
tiresome
routine
but
for
your
sake
and
for
old
i
ll
do
all
i
can
to
get
you
on
a
ship
i
do
know
that
there
is
talk
of
giving
over
the
communications
and
radio
work
of
one
ship
for
a
single
trip
to
a
group
of
waves
just
to
see
how
it
works
out
i
ll
look
into
oh
please
do
she
begged
eagerly
you
should
be
devoting
your
entire
time
to
this
secret
radio
business
right
now
he
said
thoughtfully
but
i
m
a
you
could
be
given
a
leave
of
not
without
a
reason
it
would
be
necessary
to
explain
to
the
officials
about
the
radio
and
that
s
just
what
doesn
t
why
well
you
know
the
story
about
his
other
invention
yes
his
radio
detector
that
was
a
disgrace
some
unscrupulous
person
stole
and
sold
it
to
a
foreign
country
he
doesn
t
want
that
to
happen
surely
not
well
you
just
keep
working
in
your
spare
time
and
after
that
we
shall
and
that
was
the
way
matters
were
left
but
not
for
so
very
long
the
next
afternoon
was
regular
time
out
for
sally
the
first
person
she
saw
as
she
entered
the
lobby
of
her
hotel
was
a
big
girl
with
a
round
beaming
face
barbara
you
stranger
she
exclaimed
where
have
you
been
hiding
haven
t
been
hiding
been
working
hard
was
the
big
girl
s
reply
i
ve
been
rigging
the
parachutes
for
a
ship
danny
s
ship
i
saw
him
on
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
but
barbara
they
don
t
use
parachutes
on
a
on
this
one
they
do
shush
barbara
held
a
finger
to
her
lips
don
t
ask
me
another
thing
about
sally
thought
she
understood
they
went
out
to
lunch
together
after
that
they
spent
three
hours
shopping
when
sally
returned
she
found
a
notice
for
a
phone
call
in
her
box
a
phone
call
on
my
day
off
she
exclaimed
maybe
a
date
how
grand
it
was
danny
and
a
date
as
well
he
was
going
for
a
spin
in
the
air
just
a
little
advanced
trainer
cabin
plane
four
hundred
and
fifty
horse
power
would
sally
like
a
look
at
the
airfield
the
palms
and
the
sea
from
the
air
sally
most
certainly
would
and
so
it
was
a
date
i
suppose
it
s
no
use
hanging
one
of
those
things
on
you
danny
said
with
a
grin
as
he
strapped
on
his
parachute
you
wouldn
t
know
what
to
do
about
it
if
something
did
go
oh
wouldn
t
i
she
challenged
you
forget
that
barbara
and
i
took
the
shorter
course
and
graduated
with
honors
from
the
say
that
s
right
you
at
that
he
produced
a
second
parachute
and
helped
her
strap
it
on
you
aren
t
planning
to
drop
me
in
the
big
pond
are
you
she
joked
nothing
like
that
this
is
a
land
plane
oh
we
ll
take
a
turn
or
two
out
over
the
sea
but
the
plane
s
been
thoroughly
worked
over
not
a
chance
of
her
going
anyway
i
ll
keep
my
fingers
she
laughed
as
she
climbed
in
when
danny
had
gone
through
the
ritual
of
turning
on
the
current
gas
and
oil
warming
up
his
motor
and
setting
his
wheels
for
the
run
they
were
off
it
was
one
of
those
cloudless
florida
evenings
when
little
fishing
boats
looking
from
the
sky
like
toys
glide
over
the
dark
blue
waters
when
a
distant
steamer
sends
off
a
slow
lazy
drifting
cloud
of
smoke
and
all
seems
at
peace
they
took
a
turn
out
over
the
ocean
then
swung
inland
where
little
blue
lakes
dot
the
dark
green
of
forests
and
the
lighter
green
of
farms
nice
place
florida
said
danny
we
ve
been
missing
something
should
have
taken
a
vacation
down
here
every
oh
so
you
re
the
son
of
a
millionaire
sally
laughed
not
quite
but
if
i
worked
hard
all
the
year
guess
i
could
make
it
what
do
you
say
we
try
it
after
the
war
is
over
illustration
they
swung
out
over
the
sea
again
don
t
mind
if
i
do
but
danny
her
voice
hit
a
serious
note
did
you
ever
think
that
war
is
not
all
a
dead
loss
think
of
the
boys
who
would
have
grown
up
to
sell
socks
or
run
a
streetcar
or
mend
and
never
get
twenty
miles
away
from
good
old
and
now
they
re
seeing
the
world
africa
india
china
south
sea
islands
this
country
of
ours
will
never
be
the
same
after
the
it
sure
won
they
swung
out
over
the
sea
again
beneath
them
a
large
ship
under
full
steam
was
gliding
out
to
sea
going
out
to
make
a
secret
meeting
with
other
ships
of
a
convoy
sally
said
wonder
how
soon
i
ll
be
sailing
with
that
ship
or
some
perhaps
never
danny
replied
soberly
they
haven
t
said
they
d
take
waves
abroad
yet
but
i
am
about
all
set
just
a
day
or
so
more
at
the
most
they
never
tell
us
oh
danny
no
oh
sally
yes
he
echoed
what
s
the
matter
want
me
to
stay
a
landlubber
all
my
life
she
did
not
answer
a
small
plane
darling
through
the
air
like
a
bird
had
caught
her
eye
that
s
your
boss
silent
storm
danny
said
when
i
learned
he
was
your
boss
i
sort
of
looked
him
up
the
boys
told
me
that
was
his
plane
no
one

he
s
a
fine
man
that
s
what
they
all
say
he
was
very
badly
shot
up
out
there
in
the
pacific
they
didn
t
expect
him
to
live
but
the
nurses
pulled
him
and
now
he
might
be
sitting
in
the
sun
living
on
a
but
who
would
want
to
in
exciting
times
like
these
not

he
works
harder
than
the
rest
of
but
danny
look
her
voice
rose
sharply
look
at
his
plane
acting
crazy
all
right
seems
to
be
out
of
danny
he
said
something
strange
once
he
said
he
wouldn
t
take
other
people
up
because
he
wasn
t
sure
of
himself
you
don
t
danny
was
thinking
and
thinking
fast
advancing
the
throttle
he
sent
his
plane
speeding
toward
the
spot
in
the
sky
where
the
small
plane
was
going
through
all
the
motions
of
a
fighter
shot
out
of
the
clouds
he
s
really
going
down
he
muttered
grimly
and
ours
is
a
land
plane
worse
they
remained
at
two
thousand
feet
starting
at
that
same
level
the
other
plane
had
gone
into
a
slow
spiral
and
was
slowly
drifting
down
if
he
hits
the
water
at
that
speed
he
s
done
danny
groaned
why
in
the
world
doesn
t
he
bail
out
perhaps
he
can
t
may
be
sally
gripped
her
hands
until
the
nails
cut
deep
into
the
flesh
there
she
exclaimed
he
s
getting
control
he
s
leveling
danny
spoke
slowly
but
he
ll
crash
all
the
same
and
his
plane
is
a
land
plane
let
s
hope
he
s
a
good
but
he
isn
sally
s
words
came
quick
and
fast
he
used
to
be
the
japs
wrecked
his
tough
luck
there
he
s
down
his
plane
is
still
it
will
sink
all
the
same
in
no
time
at
danny
sally
gripped
his
arm
tight
just
circle
over
that
spot
she
stood
up
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
m
going
over
the
side
i
m
a
good
swimmer
i
can
save
the

i
can

never
okay
good
girl

luck

he
dragged
a
rubber
raft
from
beneath
his
feet
tucking
the
raft
under
her
left
arm
and
gripping
the
ripcord
with
her
right
hand
sally
opened
the
cabin
door
stood
there
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
she
was
gone
chapter
ten
sally
saves
a
life
fifty
seconds
is
not
a
lot
of
time
but
sally
had
taken
her
chute
training
seriously
in
just
that
many
seconds
she
did
several
things
she
pulled
her
ripcord
waited
breathless
then
felt
the
pull
of
the
opening
chute
finding
that
she
was
facing
the
wind
she
turned
herself
about
looking
down
she
judged
that
she
would
hit
the
water
only
fifty
yards
or
so
from
major
storm
s
rapidly
vanishing
plane
catching
the
raft
by
its
edges
she
held
it
before
her
and
waited
ten
seconds
later
as
the
lapping
waves
reached
for
her
she
did
a
sort
of
swan
dive
and
landed
flat
with
the
raft
beneath
her
she
laughed
in
spite
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
freeing
herself
from
her
parachute
harness
rearing
up
on
her
elbows
she
looked
for
the
plane
gone
she
cried
in
dismay
just
then
she
saw
a
hand
go
up
silent
storm
was
doing
his
best
throwing
herself
flat
on
the
raft
and
using
her
hands
for
paddles
she
threw
all
her
strength
into
an
effort
to
reach
him
even
so
weakened
by
his
efforts
and
the
pain
his
back
gave
him
he
had
gone
down
once
before
she
reached
him
a
brief
struggle
followed
and
then
he
lay
on
the
raft
and
stared
up
at
the
sky
shouldn
t
have
done
he
talked
with
difficulty
i
m
really
not
worth
it
shouldn
t
have
gone
up
but
flying
somehow
gets
into
your
i
know
she
replied
quietly
it
s
all
right
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
this
for
anything
somehow
i
thought
that
parachuting
was
a
good
thing
to
know
now
i
m
sure
of
it
you
ll
be
fine
when
you
get
your
breath
danny
will
send
out
a
they
were
both
wet
to
the
skin
that
didn
t
matter
too
much
there
was
a
warm
land
breeze
from
the
shore
stripping
off
their
sodden
jackets
they
allowed
their
thin
cotton
shirts
to
bag
and
flutter
in
the
breeze
i
ve
often
dreamed
of
being
on
the
sea
in
one
of
these
rubber
rafts
he
mused
men
have
lived
in
them
for
it
wouldn
t
be
bad
if
the
weather
were
always
like
she
leaned
back
in
lazy
comfort
it
s
rather
rough
on
me
this
experience
he
said
at
last
it
s
too
bad
you
lost
your
oh
it
s
not
that
i
could
buy
another
thing
is
i
ve
really
proved
to
myself
that
i
m
no
good
for
flying
i
went
out
cold
right
up
in
the
air
i
came
out
of
it
in
time
to
save
myself
but
not
my
ship
even
so
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
i
d
have
you
re
too
important
to
be
taking
such
needless
there
was
a
note
of
kindness
in
her
voice
yes
i
suppose
you
re
right
but
i
have
so
wanted
to
be
back
there
in
the
islands
with
my
friends
fighting
it
out
with
those
unspeakable
japs
i
kept
sort
of
kidding
myself
along
but
now
you
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
ah
so
you
re
a
preacher
he
laughed
well
i
don
t
mind
what
s
the
rest
of
the
sermon
you
ll
have
to
make
new
friends
where
you
are
you
ve
made
some
already
i
am
one
of
them
one
of
the
least
of
far
from
that
one
of
the
greatest
i
prize
your
but
you
have
asked
to
be
sent
away
on
a
i
ll
come
back
i
oh
his
voice
rose
i
meant
to
tell
you
it
s
more
than
half
arranged
already
there
s
a
new
type
of
fighting
ship
going
out
with
a
convoy
in
a
day
or
two
she
s
a
small
airplane
carrier
built
specially
for
convoy
duty
but
he
hastened
to
add
you
ll
not
whisper
a
word
of
of
course
to
herself
she
thought
that
must
be
danny
s
ship
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
if
i
were
to
sail
on
his
ship
this
hope
was
lost
for
the
time
at
least
for
storm
went
on
this
is
the
ship
s
maiden
voyage
she
will
carry
a
crew
all
men
but
if
all
goes
well
on
the
following
trip
it
is
planned
to
use
some
women
nurses
and
a
number
of
waves
for
secretarial
work
storekeepers
radio
and
a
testing
trip
exactly
i
have
already
put
in
a
word
for
you
i
hated
that
for
i
wanted
both
nancy
and
yourself
on
my
own
force
but
there
s
that
secret
yes
there
s
the
radio
she
agreed
with
enthusiasm
we
ll
work
it
out
together
i
have
two
sets
i
ve
already
written
asking
permission
to
leave
one
with
you
in
case
i
am
sent
across
that
way
we
can
try
it
it
s
good
of
you
to
suggest
it
but
don
t
hope
for
too
much
there
is
a
lot
of
radio
silence
when
you
re
on
convoy
duty
it
s
necessary
you
that
s
just
it
she
exclaimed
if
we
get
in
a
really
tight
place
and
don
t
dare
use
the
regular
radio
we
can
switch
to
our
secret
radio
you
could
stand
by
with
your
set
at
regular
hours
couldn
t
you
then
it
s
all
arranged
don
t
you
see
if
you
and
i
can
work
out
this
secret
radio
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
really
big
thing
it
will
make
up
for
the
other
things
you
want
to
do
and
can
t
you
re
wonderful
he
exclaimed
we
ll
do
things
together
look
she
exclaimed
here
s
a
small
flashlight
attached
to
the
boat
yes
and
a
fish
line
with
artificial
bait
attached
we
re
all
set
for
a
long
sail
he
laughed
at
least
the
flashlight
will
come
in
handy
for
signaling
our
rescuers
it
s
getting
sally
tried
the
flashlight
it
worked
the
line
and
tackle
too
was
tried
and
with
rather
startling
results
after
unwinding
the
line
sally
propped
herself
up
on
her
knees
then
gave
the
bright
nickel
spinner
a
fling
well
out
over
the
dusky
blue
waters
she
drew
it
in
slowly
at
first
then
faster
and
faster
ah
he
murmured
i
see
you
are
a
not
an
expert
was
her
modest
comment
my
father
loves
to
fish
i
go
with
him
to
the
lakes
sometimes
we
cast
for
pike
and
bass
and
sometimes
a
big
then
there
s
a
a
wonderful
battle
i
love
it
she
gave
the
spinner
one
more
fling
this
time
far
out
from
the
boat
scarcely
had
she
begun
speeding
up
her
pull
when
suddenly
she
all
but
pitched
head
foremost
into
the
sea
hey
he
exclaimed
seizing
her
by
the
waist
and
pulling
her
back
not
so
fast
she
exclaimed
i
ve
got
something
big
reaching
around
her
he
grasped
the
line
and
together
they
pulled
now
he
breathed
i
ll
pull
and
you
roll
in
the
line
now
he
heaved
away
and
she
rolled
line
the
fish
came
sometimes
slowly
sometimes
faster
a
quarter
of
the
line
was
in
half
two
thirds
and
oh
give
him
line
she
exclaimed
he
ll
have
us
both
in
the
they
gave
him
line
then
started
pulling
in
three
times
this
was
repeated
at
last
apparently
the
fish
came
all
the
way
in
give
us
a
light
storm
said
as
the
fish
came
close
to
the
boat
let
s
see
what
we
she
switched
on
the
small
flashlight
ah
a
small
tuna
a
beauty
he
breathed
we
must
have
a
small
one
she
exclaimed
perhaps
twenty
how
big
is
a
big
one
five
hundred
pounds
is
a
nice
size
watch
out
his
words
rang
out
sharply
she
dodged
back
there
had
been
a
sudden
white
flash
in
the
water
then
the
line
gave
a
great
yank
a
shark
a
bad
one
he
exclaimed
again
he
got
our
no
the
fish
is
still
there
pull
him
in
quick
the
fish
came
flapping
into
the
boat
all
here
but
the
tail
was
his
comment
baked
tuna
is
not
half
bad
we
ll
have
a
for
a
time
after
that
they
sat
watching
the
waters
the
shark
did
not
return
the
night
really
settled
down
the
city
s
lights
painted
a
picture
against
the
wall
of
darkness
beyond
and
all
was
still
out
of
that
stillness
came
the
of
a
motorboat
they
re
coming
for
us
she
said
huskily
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
it
s
nice
to
have
been
with
you
he
said
when
an
hour
later
he
let
her
out
of
a
taxi
at
her
hotel
door
thanks
for
saving
my
life
and
all
it
s
been
fun
she
said
it
really
has
think
i
ll
resign
from
the
waves
and
join
the
life
oh
yes
he
exclaimed
with
one
foot
on
the
running
board
don
t
forget
we
have
one
more
dinner
date
our
tuna
catch
must
be
honored
shall
we
say
tomorrow
evening
that
will
be
then
it
s
a
if
i
hear
from
and
have
his
permission
she
added
i
ll
bring
over
the
secret
good
you
can
give
me
a
few
lessons
regarding
its
and
we
ll
have
a
at
the
sub
if
that
s
what
it
is
and
here
s
here
s
hoping
good
night
good
night
his
taxi
rolled
away
it
s
a
strange
world
she
thought
as
she
walked
up
the
marble
steps
chapter
eleven
secret
meeting
three
weeks
later
sally
was
again
on
those
fine
waters
again
it
was
night
once
more
the
city
painted
its
many
colored
pictures
against
the
sky
but
how
strangely
different
was
the
craft
on
which
she
rode
gone
was
the
small
rubber
raft
the
tuna
and
the
shark
gone
too
was
strange
intriguing
silent
storm
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
see
him
again
she
told
herself
but
i
may
talk
to
him
perhaps
many
this
was
true
during
the
weeks
that
had
just
passed
she
had
secured
permission
from
her
aged
benefactor
the
radio
inventor
to
show
the
secret
radio
to
silent
storm
she
had
taken
it
to
his
house
for
the
first
time
on
the
night
of
the
tuna
feast
that
feast
had
been
a
great
success
nancy
had
gone
with
her
never
had
she
seen
silent
storm
so
carefree
and
gay
as
on
that
night
when
the
feast
was
over
the
three
of
them
sally
nancy
and
silent
storm
had
retired
to
his
den
there
the
secret
radio
was
set
up
since
he
had
a
private
with
the
station
s
great
aerial
things
had
gone
very
well
for
a
time
it
is
true
no
sound
came
over
that
secret
wave
length
but
this
had
happened
many
times
before
when
at
last
the
began
the
strange
broadcasters
had
put
on
a
real
show
as
on
one
other
occasion
the
six
separate
units
broadcasting
were
some
distance
apart
then
came
the
sudden
loud
and
insistent
bark
of
a
broadcast
for
all
the
world
like
the
call
of
a
wolf
leader
to
his
pack
a
call
to
the
kill
sally
had
thought
to
herself
she
was
thrilled
to
the
very
center
of
her
being
but
said
never
a
word
she
wanted
silent
storm
to
listen
and
form
his
own
opinions
slowly
surely
quite
like
the
wolves
of
the
great
white
north
the
broadcasters
drew
closer
and
closer
together
closing
in
on
the
scarcely
could
she
avoid
speaking
aloud
then
came
the
loud
irregular
barks
of
apparent
command
strangely
enough
when
all
this
excitement
was
over
and
the
broadcasters
began
to
separate
there
were
only
five
one
had
gone
silent
that
said
silent
storm
mopping
his
brow
is
one
of
the
strangest
things
i
ever
is
it
an
enemy
sub
sally
asked
it
would
be
only
one
other
thing
storm
spoke
slowly
it
could
be
a
flight
of
our
bombers
concentrating
on
a
target
and
then
delivering
their
cargoes
of
death
and
yes
sally
agreed
the
broadcasts
fit
that
picture
quite
as
we
can
only
wait
and
see
said
storm
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
get
nancy
and
you
on
a
ship
at
the
earliest
possible
nancy
seemed
a
bit
startled
by
this
but
sally
said
that
will
be
swell
illustration
it
could
be
a
flight
of
our
you
see
said
storm
when
you
are
on
a
ship
you
are
constantly
changing
your
position
once
you
are
at
the
center
of
the
atlantic
if
these
secret
broadcasters
put
on
a
show
like
this
for
you
and
if
it
is
north
south
or
west
of
you
you
ll
know
at
once
that
they
are
subs
and
not
bombers
and
then
he
struck
the
table
a
blow
then
we
ll
go
after
them
last
year
we
lost
twelve
million
tons
of
shipping
to
those
think
of
it
a
million
tons
a
month
that
might
mean
the
losing
of
the
war
but
with
this
secret
radio
of
yours
if
things
are
as
we
suppose
them
to
be
what
we
won
t
do
to
those
inhuman
beasts
who
have
men
struggling
in
the
water
and
women
on
rafts
after
that
night
sally
had
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
danny
s
ship
then
one
day
she
met
danny
on
the
street
yes
he
whispered
we
are
safely
back
she
s
a
grand
old
ship
i
got
a
danny
good
for
you
she
wanted
to
hug
him
right
there
on
the
street
we
re
sailing
tomorrow
night
with
a
fresh
convoy
he
confided
and
i
ve
been
told
you
are
to
sail
with
and
now
here
i
am
sally
thought
as
she
watched
the
city
s
lights
fade
while
they
sailed
out
into
the
dark
mysterious
night
she
was
standing
on
a
great
flat
top
deck
nancy
was
at
her
side
a
dim
shadow
larger
shadows
that
were
airplanes
loomed
at
their
backs
no
lights
were
showing
the
radio
was
silent
they
were
alone
on
the
sea
and
yet
there
was
to
be
a
convoy
that
will
come
later
lieutenant
riggs
radio
officer
for
their
told
her
the
ships
of
our
convoy
come
from
many
places
boston
new
york
portland
even
san
francisco
someone
stuck
a
pin
in
a
map
the
spot
is
right
out
there
in
the
our
secret
meeting
sally
wet
her
lips
it
was
all
so
strange
it
s
all
of
that
was
the
quiet
response
and
it
better
be
mighty
secret
at
that
forty
ships
all
loaded
food
airplanes
soldiers
there
are
even
a
hundred
wacs
going
over
in
one
of
those
a
hundred
wacs
sally
thought
as
she
caught
the
last
spark
of
light
from
the
shore
there
were
twelve
waves
on
this
airplane
carrier
and
they
weren
t
just
going
over
but
over
and
back
there
were
six
women
nurses
as
well
this
was
to
be
a
trial
trip
i
hope
we
make
good
she
had
said
to
lieutenant
riggs
oh
you
will
i
can
see
it
in
your
will
we
make
good
she
asked
nancy
we
ll
do
our
best
was
the
solemn
reply
but
what
about
the
secret
radio
we
can
always
listen
for
the
subs
they
can
t
detect
our
listening
perhaps
that
s
the
most
important
of
silent
storm
has
the
other
set
yes
he
ll
be
standing
by
for
a
half
hour
in
the
morning
and
again
at
night
in
an
emergency
the
secret
radio
might
help
other
than
that
silence
is
the
order
of
the
yes
subs
have
ears
nancy
agreed
loose
talk
may
sink
a
it
s
nice
to
have
danny
on
the
which
do
you
like
best
danny
or
storm
nancy
asked
i
like
them
both
but
in
different
ways
storm
is
like
a
big
brother
he
helps
a
lot
danny
s
just
a
very
nice
and
really
nice
boys
are
about
the
nicest
creatures
in
the
nancy
laughed
low
i
m
going
below
for
a
few
winks
of
sally
turned
away
there
ll
be
work
to
do
i
couldn
t
sleep
now
it
s
all
too
strange
nancy
murmured
her
eyes
on
the
sea
and
indeed
for
this
american
girl
it
was
strange
all
her
life
she
had
been
looked
after
cared
for
the
things
she
wanted
she
got
she
had
joined
the
waves
to
do
her
bit
but
with
the
thought
that
she
would
remain
in
america
now
caught
up
and
carried
on
by
sally
s
enthusiasm
she
had
gone
to
sea
she
had
been
told
that
theirs
was
to
be
a
slow
convoy
that
they
would
be
twelve
days
at
sea
twelve
days
she
whispered
looking
away
at
the
dark
waters
of
night
twelve
losses
from
sinking
were
greater
in
these
days
than
ever
before
she
could
swim
but
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
being
thrown
into
those
cold
black
miserable
waters
how
was
it
all
to
end
whatever
happens
i
m
in
it
to
the
end
she
had
written
her
mother
just
before
she
sailed
and
that
s
that
she
told
herself
stoutly
as
she
turned
to
make
her
way
down
the
ladder
to
the
forward
cabins
on
the
deck
below
where
the
nurses
and
the
waves
had
their
quarters
four
hours
later
sally
found
herself
standing
on
the
ship
s
tower
beside
her
stood
lieutenant
riggs
riggs
was
a
veteran
ship
s
radio
engineer
no
one
seemed
to
know
how
old
he
was
he
was
tall
erect
every
inch
a
sailor
his
steel
gray
hair
told
that
he
was
not
young
his
sharp
darting
eyes
had
told
sally
that
here
was
a
man
who
would
demand
exactness
of
service
and
loyalty
and
she
loved
him
for
that
she
was
feeling
a
bit
nervous
for
this
was
to
be
her
first
testing
at
sea
they
had
arrived
at
the
place
of
meeting
an
unmarked
spot
in
an
endless
sea
ahead
of
the
other
members
of
the
convoy
just
a
moment
before
she
had
caught
a
winking
blink
on
the
horizon
there
s
one
south
southwest
she
had
said
to
riggs
you
have
good
eyes
he
commended
give
them
this
message
see
if
they
get
as
he
read
off
the
location
the
other
ship
was
to
take
in
relation
to
the
airplane
carrier
she
blinked
it
out
in
code
with
the
aid
of
an
electric
blinker
aimed
like
a
gun
at
the
other
ship
they
waited
then
came
the
answering
blinks
they
got
it
she
said
simply
they
will
go
at
once
to
their
very
good
was
his
quiet
reply
for
a
full
hour
after
that
they
stood
there
he
giving
orders
in
a
low
monotone
and
she
blinking
them
across
the
waters
to
some
ship
as
the
work
went
forward
her
heart
swelled
with
pride
she
was
part
of
something
really
big
great
ships
moved
in
on
the
dark
horizon
ships
loaded
with
oil
airplanes
food
soldiers
everything
that
is
vital
to
war
like
an
usher
in
some
great
theater
of
the
sea
she
told
each
ship
where
its
place
was
to
be
and
it
silently
glided
into
position
this
she
murmured
is
the
life
you
are
doing
very
well
was
riggs
s
comment
not
a
mistake
there
were
no
mistakes
when
the
last
ship
had
taken
its
position
there
came
low
orders
passed
from
man
to
man
then
they
began
moving
on
into
the
night
still
sally
and
lieutenant
riggs
held
their
places
one
ship
had
forgotten
or
failed
to
receive
the
hour
of
departure
a
question
blinked
to
them
was
speedily
answered
then
they
too
began
to
move
a
half
hour
later
a
tanker
lagging
behind
was
ordered
to
put
on
more
steam
and
so
it
went
until
four
hours
were
gone
then
nancy
appeared
with
a
young
lieutenant
and
sally
crept
away
to
her
quarters
for
more
sleep
how
do
you
like
it
a
nurse
with
a
kindly
face
asked
fine
so
far
was
her
answer
just
swell
and
so
different
yes
it
s
different
all
right
you
might
like
to
know
the
nurse
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
i
m
danny
duke
s
danny
s
mother
he
told
me
about
you
and
nancy
he
likes
the
woman
gave
her
a
fine
smile
and
we
like
him
he
caught
me
once
saved
me
from
a
broken
leg
or
something
was
sally
s
reply
yes
he
told
me
about
she
laughed
danny
s
just
a
boy
you
know
he
s
my
only
child
you
won
t
tell
that
i
m
his
mother
she
begged
it
s
a
bit
irregular
my
being
on
a
ship
with
him
but
i
wanted
it
so
i
told
them
if
sons
could
sail
the
sea
then
mothers
could
too
so
they
took
me
on
just
for
this
trip
it
s
sort
of
a
tryout
for
all
of
us
you
yes
i
know
i
won
t
tell
a
soul
thanks
so
much
for
telling
sally
moved
on
chapter
twelve
they
fly
at
dawn
sally
awoke
with
a
start
she
had
had
a
strange
dream
in
the
dream
three
of
her
best
friends
had
stood
by
her
berth
looking
down
at
her
the
older
of
the
three
said
she
won
t
wake
up
in
not
in
time
the
next
in
line
agreed
oh
yes
she
will
the
third
exclaimed
confidently
well
i
m
awake
sally
thought
now
i
have
all
the
bother
of
going
back
to
sleep
she
closed
her
eyes
then
opened
them
wide
again
through
her
eyelids
she
had
received
an
impression
of
red
light
and
yes
there
it
was
the
cabin
was
dark
but
the
faint
red
light
was
there
all
the
same
my
secret
radio
she
thought
i
can
t
have
left
it
on
she
propped
herself
on
an
elbow
to
peer
into
the
darkness
she
had
left
the
radio
close
to
her
berth
just
in
there
was
no
harm
in
that
for
only
nancy
slept
in
the
berth
above
it
s
on
she
thought
i
m
sure
i
turned
it
this
was
strange
for
nancy
had
been
fast
asleep
when
she
turned
in
sally
had
tried
picking
up
some
sound
of
the
of
the
mysterious
broadcasters
and
failed
then
she
at
that
her
thoughts
broke
off
short
for
very
faintly
because
the
radio
was
turned
low
there
came
the
familiar
i
turned
the
radio
on
in
my
sleep
she
told
herself
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
possible
conclusion
yet
it
seemed
close
to
a
miracle
that
she
had
done
so
for
during
the
two
preceding
days
she
had
caught
not
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
broadcast
on
her
secret
radio
and
now
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
was
coming
in
strong
needless
to
say
she
listened
with
both
her
ears
for
two
whole
days
she
and
nancy
together
with
riggs
and
the
second
radioman
had
kept
their
convoy
together
with
blinker
lights
by
night
and
flags
by
day
not
a
sound
had
come
from
a
radio
on
any
ship
of
the
convoy
it
had
been
one
of
the
strangest
experiences
of
sally
s
entire
life
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
after
a
look
at
dark
bulks
looming
here
and
there
on
the
horizon
and
to
wake
up
with
those
same
ships
in
the
identical
position
in
regard
to
one
another
yet
some
hundreds
of
miles
on
their
way
had
seemed
unbelievable
but
now
here
was
the
secret
radio
talking
again
this
may
be
the
hour
she
whispered
excitedly
as
having
turned
the
dial
she
listened
once
again
slipping
from
her
berth
she
drew
on
a
heavy
velvet
dressing
gown
turned
the
radio
up
a
little
then
sat
there
listening
turning
a
dial
now
and
then
listening
some
more
and
all
the
time
growing
more
excited
after
twenty
minutes
of
listening
her
face
took
on
a
look
of
sheer
horror
i
can
t
do
it
she
thought
i
may
be
but
i
must
i
must
for
a
full
five
minutes
she
sat
there
deep
in
perplexing
thought
having
at
last
reached
a
decision
she
went
into
action
after
dressing
hurriedly
she
shut
off
the
radio
and
disconnected
its
wires
then
seizing
it
by
the
handle
she
slipped
out
of
the
stateroom
glided
along
one
passageway
after
another
to
wind
up
at
last
in
the
radio
room
where
lieutenant
riggs
was
standing
watch
alone
why
hello
sally
riggs
exclaimed
what
s
up
he
glanced
down
at
the
black
box
you
re
not
planning
to
leave
the
ship
i
hope
during
the
days
of
fine
sailing
they
had
enjoyed
together
since
the
start
of
the
convoy
voyage
she
and
riggs
had
become
quite
good
friends
she
did
not
join
in
his
laugh
instead
she
said
lieutenant
riggs
something
terrible
is
happening
we
are
being
surrounded
by
an
enemy
of
sally
he
exclaimed
you
ve
been
having
a
bad
dream
you
d
better
go
back
to
it
s
no
her
face
was
white
it
s
a
terrible
but
sally
how
could
you
know
that
the
moon
is
down
the
sky
is
black
it
s
three
in
the
morning
you
haven
t
a
radio
and
even
i
have
heard
nothing
within
a
thousand
that
i
can
hear
those
wolves
he
added
no
nor
you
yes
she
replied
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
do
have
a
radio
and
i
can
hear
the
sub
have
been
hearing
them
for
half
an
what
he
stared
at
her
as
if
he
thought
her
mad
then
his
eyes
fell
on
her
black
box
what
s
that
thing
he
asked
in
a
not
unkindly
voice
it
s
a
secret
she
was
ready
to
cry
by
now
sending
and
receiving
there
s
only
one
other
like
it
in
the
world
perhaps
they
ll
me
for
it
i
know
how
strict
the
regulations
are
about
radios
but
that
does
not
matter
now
she
squared
her
shoulders
all
that
matters
now
is
that
you
connect
up
this
radio
that
you
listen
to
it
and
believe
what
i
tell
i
ll
he
did
not
smile
in
no
time
at
all
the
radio
was
hooked
up
and
louder
than
ever
that
s
a
sub
giving
orders
to
another
sub
she
said
quietly
ah
he
breathed
now
watch
i
turn
this
dial
that
changes
the
direction
of
our
listening
for
a
space
of
seconds
there
came
no
sound
and
then
again
that
s
a
different
sub
answering
the
there
was
quiet
confidence
in
her
voice
it
has
a
different
so
it
does
he
agreed
in
the
next
ten
minutes
she
located
six
different
radios
operating
out
there
somewhere
in
the
night
there
are
two
others
she
said
as
she
straightened
up
eight
in
eight
he
repeated
after
her
they
re
on
every
side
of
us
she
said
quietly
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
comes
tells
on
every
side
of
riggs
seemed
in
a
daze
but
you
can
t
know
unless
you
ve
listened
to
them
as
i
she
gripped
his
arm
in
her
excitement
they
re
closing
in
on
our
convoy
from
all
sides
closing
in
for
the
closing
in
for
the
the
lieutenant
spoke
like
one
in
a
trance
thousands
of
lives
soldiers
nurses
wacs
airplanes
ammunition
in
for
the
kill
watch
the
radio
he
ordered
i
ll
be
back
with
the
captain
the
captain
oh
oh
no
she
cried
but
he
was
gone
to
say
that
sally
was
frightened
would
not
have
expressed
it
at
all
for
some
time
after
riggs
left
she
sat
there
shivering
with
fear
riggs
had
gone
for
the
captain
did
that
mean
that
he
believed
what
she
had
told
him
or
had
he
been
shocked
by
the
realization
that
she
had
laid
herself
open
to
he
s
gone
for
the
captain
she
told
herself
at
last
he
d
never
think
of
doing
that
just
to
get
me
into
deeper
trouble
he
s
not
that
kind
of
a
at
that
she
drew
in
three
deep
breaths
and
felt
better
he
s
gone
for
the
captain
she
thought
and
shuddered
she
had
seen
the
captain
on
the
bridge
that
was
all
he
had
seemed
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
the
sort
you
saw
on
the
bridge
in
movies
stern
unsmiling
inflexible
she
shuddered
again
but
here
was
riggs
and
with
him
the
captain
miss
scott
said
riggs
will
you
kindly
repeat
your
performance
with
that
that
radio
for
the
captain
s
benefit
sally
s
fingers
trembled
as
she
turned
on
the
radio
noting
this
the
captain
said
as
you
his
dark
eyes
twinkled
as
he
added
we
re
not
angin
danny
deever
in
the
mornin
so
the
captain
has
a
sense
of
humor
the
girl
thought
and
at
once
felt
much
better
not
only
did
she
repeat
the
demonstration
she
had
put
on
for
riggs
but
for
a
full
half
hour
she
turned
dials
bringing
in
first
this
broadcaster
then
another
and
at
the
same
time
demonstrating
by
circles
and
angles
that
they
were
moving
in
closer
ever
closer
to
the
convoy
not
this
alone
but
in
her
eagerness
to
be
understood
and
trusted
she
told
the
whole
story
of
the
secret
radio
and
the
experiments
that
had
been
carried
on
from
the
beginning
illustration
riggs
i
m
convinced
the
captain
declared
riggs
i
m
convinced
the
captain
declared
at
last
they
will
strike
at
dawn
in
a
half
hour
our
men
will
be
ordered
to
battle
stations
twenty
minutes
before
dawn
ten
planes
will
leave
the
ship
to
scour
the
sea
at
the
same
time
half
our
destroyers
will
take
up
the
search
miss
scott
i
salute
he
clicked
his
heels
instantly
sally
was
on
her
feet
with
a
true
sailor
s
salute
they
believe
me
she
thought
as
the
pair
left
the
radio
cabin
by
rights
i
should
want
to
shout
or
burst
into
she
wanted
to
do
neither
just
felt
cold
and
numb
that
was
all
then
as
red
blood
flooded
back
to
her
cheeks
and
she
thought
of
fighting
planes
and
destroyers
shooting
away
before
dawn
practically
at
her
command
she
suddenly
felt
like
joan
of
arc
or
helen
of
troy
then
a
terrible
thought
assailed
her
what
if
it
were
all
a
mistake
only
time
could
answer
that
question
time
and
the
dawn
they
fly
at
dawn
she
whispered
just
then
someone
entered
the
cabin
it
was
nancy
sally
she
exclaimed
why
are
you
here
this
is
not
your
watch
i
woke
up
and
missed
you
what
have
you
been
doing
plenty
said
sally
sit
down
and
i
ll
tell
chapter
thirteen
among
the
missing
presently
riggs
came
hurrying
back
nancy
and
sally
remained
in
the
radio
room
dividing
their
time
between
listening
for
messages
from
the
outside
world
and
watching
with
awe
the
circle
being
drawn
about
the
convoy
by
the
enemy
sub
pack
riggs
busied
himself
getting
off
messages
from
station
to
station
on
the
ship
all
men
were
ordered
to
their
posts
planes
not
in
readiness
were
prepared
for
flight
some
were
hoisted
from
the
lower
deck
to
flight
deck
it
s
like
a
calm
before
a
terrible
storm
nancy
said
to
sally
soon
enough
they
were
to
learn
what
an
actual
storm
could
mean
to
a
convoy
at
sea
for
the
present
however
there
was
quite
enough
to
occupy
their
minds
once
when
sally
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
flight
deck
for
a
breath
of
air
she
chanced
to
bump
into
danny
duke
oh
danny
she
exclaimed
must
you
go
out
he
was
garbed
in
flying
togs
a
parachute
hung
at
his
back
sure
he
laughed
what
do
you
think
i
trained
for
a
game
of
volleyball
she
didn
t
think
she
just
didn
t
want
anyone
she
liked
as
well
as
danny
to
be
out
there
fighting
subs
dodging
antiaircraft
fire
and
watching
the
black
sea
that
waited
to
swallow
him
up
at
last
as
dawn
approached
and
a
young
officer
came
to
take
her
place
sally
closed
up
her
black
box
removed
the
wires
and
marched
away
to
store
it
under
her
berth
stay
there
a
while
she
whispered
until
we
know
whether
you
mean
honor
or
disaster
for
it
was
with
a
sober
face
that
she
returned
to
the
flight
deck
she
found
the
planes
that
were
to
go
all
in
place
their
motors
turning
over
slowly
she
caught
a
quick
breath
as
the
first
plane
took
off
then
the
second
and
third
had
whirled
away
when
a
hand
waved
to
her
as
a
voice
shouted
hi
sally
see
you
later
it
was
danny
in
ten
seconds
he
was
not
there
gone
just
like
she
swallowed
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
yes
just
like
that
came
in
a
quiet
voice
sally
turned
to
find
danny
s
mother
standing
beside
her
was
danny
sally
murmured
hoarsely
yes
that
was
my
boy
you
want
him
to
go
sally
asked
of
course
my
child
he
s
well
prepared
danny
is
it
s
the
work
he
was
trained
to
do
our
country
is
at
war
we
must
all
do
our
the
mother
s
eyes
were
bright
but
no
tears
gleamed
there
it
s
so
much
easier
to
dream
of
war
than
it
is
to
see
it
feel
it
and
be
a
part
of
it
sally
murmured
yes
dreams
are
often
more
pleasing
than
the
realities
of
life
danny
s
mother
agreed
sally
stood
where
she
was
there
was
comfort
to
be
had
from
communing
with
this
big
motherly
woman
comfort
and
peace
and
just
then
she
was
greatly
in
need
of
peace
for
she
was
being
weighed
in
the
balance
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
everything
and
so
she
stood
there
waiting
for
the
answer
and
then
the
answer
came
a
muffled
roar
that
seemed
to
shake
the
sea
they
ve
found
them
duke
said
that
s
a
they
were
there
they
ve
found
them
sally
wanted
to
shout
for
joy
she
said
never
a
word
just
stood
there
thinking
good
old
will
be
famous
because
of
his
secret
radio
i
won
t
be
and
thrown
out
of
service
for
bringing
it
on
board
perhaps
it
has
saved
the
convoy
from
attack
may
save
it
again
and
again
glory
glory
just
then
there
came
another
roar
this
was
followed
by
a
series
of
that
s
antiaircraft
fire
said
danny
s
mother
does
it
come
from
our
destroyers
sally
asked
no
we
are
the
ones
who
have
airplanes
not
they
besides
our
guns
on
the
destroyers
don
t
sound
like
that
you
ll
hear
them
there
there
s
one
now
there
had
come
a
boom
that
seemed
to
roll
away
to
sea
there
was
another
and
another
all
this
time
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
were
anchored
in
some
harbor
the
forty
ships
laden
with
freight
and
human
cargo
kept
their
places
and
moved
majestically
forward
it
s
beautiful
danny
s
mother
murmured
and
terrible
sally
added
with
a
sigh
soon
from
all
sides
there
came
the
roar
of
bombs
the
of
antiaircraft
fire
and
all
the
time
sally
was
thinking
danny
oh
danny
and
what
of
danny
having
been
told
the
course
he
should
take
he
had
gone
gliding
straight
away
toward
his
supposed
objective
nor
did
he
miss
it
feeling
safe
in
their
false
security
the
eight
enemy
submarines
on
the
surface
had
come
gliding
silently
toward
the
apparently
defenseless
convoy
at
the
sound
of
danny
s
roaring
motor
the
sub
he
had
been
sent
to
destroy
crashdived
but
too
late
swooping
low
danny
released
a
bomb
with
unerring
accuracy
it
missed
them
by
feet
but
when
it
exploded
it
brought
the
sub
to
the
surface
with
a
rush
and
roar
of
foam
by
the
time
danny
could
swing
back
three
of
the
enemy
had
manned
an
antiaircraft
gun
but
nothing
daunted
danny
again
swung
low
and
this
time
he
did
not
miss
his
bomb
fell
squarely
on
the
craft
and
it
exploded
with
a
terrific
roar
but
before
this
could
happen
the
antiaircraft
gun
had
put
a
shell
squarely
through
the
body
of
danny
s
plane
ripping
the
radio
away
damaging
the
plane
s
controls
and
missing
sending
danny
to
oblivion
by
only
a
foot
or
two
that
said
danny
as
if
talking
of
someone
other
than
himself
was
your
closest
miss
another
time
they
d
get
you
but
that
other
time
won
t
so
how
about
getting
back
to
the
ship
yes
how
his
motor
was
missing
and
his
controls
stuck
at
every
turn
in
the
meantime
three
planes
came
zooming
back
anxiously
sally
waited
as
the
landing
crews
made
them
fast
danny
s
plane
was
not
among
them
one
plane
a
had
been
shot
up
its
pilot
was
wounded
duke
went
away
to
care
for
him
the
other
two
planes
remained
on
board
just
long
enough
to
take
on
more
bombs
then
they
were
off
again
catching
sally
s
eye
the
captain
motioned
her
to
join
him
at
the
bridge
it
s
marvelous
he
told
her
that
secret
radio
of
yours
has
saved
ships
and
lives
eight
subs
all
ready
to
pounce
on
us
and
now
he
swung
his
arm
in
a
broad
circle
taking
in
all
the
gliding
ships
this
was
high
praise
sally
s
bosom
swelled
with
pride
danny
she
said
without
thinking
what
about
danny
he
laughed
hell
be
back
with
the
rest
a
fine
boy
danny
there
are
few
better
we
need
a
lot
of
dannys
in
this
a
lot
of
dannys
but
there
s
only
one
she
replied
she
left
the
bridge
to
wander
back
to
the
deck
one
more
badly
crippled
plane
made
a
try
for
the
deck
but
missed
and
fell
into
the
sea
a
line
was
thrown
to
the
pilot
and
he
was
pulled
on
board
have
you
seen
danny
she
asked
as
the
man
came
up
dripping
wet
he
sputtered
coughing
up
salt
water
why
yes
once
he
was
after
a
sub
got
him
i
guess
but
there
were
the
aa
guns
you
yes
sally
knew
she
had
heard
them
her
heart
ached
at
the
thought
of
them
other
planes
came
in
had
they
seen
danny
no
were
they
going
out
again
orders
were
not
to
go
all
subs
had
been
accounted
for
looked
as
if
a
fog
would
blow
in
any
time
it
had
been
a
grand
day
at
last
all
planes
were
in
but
one
and
that
was
danny
s
then
came
the
fog
drifting
in
from
the
north
where
fogs
are
born
it
hid
every
ship
of
the
convoy
from
sally
s
view
turning
she
walked
bravely
along
the
deck
climbed
down
the
ladder
entered
her
room
threw
herself
on
her
berth
and
sobbed
her
heart
out
to
an
empty
world
finally
she
sat
up
resolutely
and
her
eyes
fell
on
the
secret
radio
here
was
an
idea
perhaps
a
way
out
danny
was
out
there
on
the
sea
he
must
be
his
plane
carried
a
rubber
raft
she
would
not
give
up
hope
they
were
not
yet
too
far
from
shore
for
heavy
searching
planes
to
reach
the
spot
she
would
get
their
location
then
she
would
radio
to
silent
storm
he
d
send
out
a
plane
a
dozen
big
planes
from
the
shore
they
could
not
fail
to
find
danny
yes
she
would
get
storm
tonight
on
the
secret
radio
but
dared
she
do
it
her
splendid
body
went
limp
at
the
thought
this
was
a
terrible
world
chapter
fourteen
the
captain
s
dinner
that
evening
at
the
hour
when
silent
storm
had
promised
to
be
waiting
at
his
florida
airport
to
receive
any
urgent
message
sally
might
send
sally
sat
alone
in
her
cabin
her
fingers
were
on
the
dial
headphones
over
her
ears
speaker
under
her
chin
i
will
she
whispered
i
must
it
s
for
the
best
pal
i
ever
had
for
and
yet
she
hesitated
it
was
very
still
in
the
cabin
there
was
only
the
faint
sound
of
water
rushing
along
the
ship
s
side
the
thin
fog
continued
the
convoy
moved
majestically
on
everyone
said
they
had
won
a
marvelous
victory
five
perhaps
six
submarines
had
been
destroyed
no
one
could
tell
for
sure
about
the
other
two
that
her
secret
radio
had
played
a
major
role
in
this
victory
she
knew
quite
well
with
her
help
this
radio
with
its
gleaming
red
eyes
had
put
out
long
fingers
and
touched
the
subs
here
there
and
everywhere
then
those
brave
boys
in
their
planes
had
gone
out
and
destroyed
them
danny
got
one
and
she
did
not
finish
she
could
not
she
started
as
there
came
a
knock
at
her
door
after
hastily
throwing
a
blanket
over
the
radio
she
said
come
the
door
opened
oh
duke
she
exclaimed
i
m
glad
you
i
thought
you
might
need
me
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
surprisingly
calm
voice
yes
sally
lifted
the
blanket
from
the
radio
that
s
good
it
s
a
fine
and
noble
danny
s
mother
took
a
chair
s
not
just
a
gesture
the
girl
exclaimed
it
s
the
realest
thing
i
ever
thought
of
doing
in
all
my
life
yes
but
you
must
not
do
it
you
must
not
send
the
it
s
for
danny
your
son
my
friend
and
pal
yes
danny
is
my
the
woman
spoke
slowly
my
only
s
been
my
life
but
you
must
not
send
that
message
it
would
almost
surely
mean
for
know
i
don
t
sally
s
hand
was
on
the
dial
illustration
thought
you
might
need
me
she
said
yes
i
know
you
would
sacrifice
your
freedom
and
your
honor
for
danny
that
is
noble
i
would
do
the
same
and
much
more
but
there
are
others
to
the
woman
s
voice
sounded
tired
so
many
others
there
are
more
soldiers
in
this
convoy
than
we
know
about
thousands
of
them
they
too
are
fine
young
men
just
as
fine
as
our
danny
they
too
are
prepared
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
their
country
it
would
be
tragic
if
their
lives
were
but
our
boys
destroyed
those
submarines
not
all
of
them
not
for
sure
and
there
are
other
enemy
there
were
never
as
many
as
now
we
know
that
they
use
the
same
as
your
radio
does
they
will
hear
your
message
and
will
hunt
us
we
will
be
listening
nancy
and
i
night
and
day
let
them
come
our
airplanes
will
destroy
them
perhaps
perhaps
not
the
weather
may
not
be
right
for
flying
and
then
try
to
think
what
it
might
be
but
danny
the
words
came
in
a
whisper
that
was
like
a
prayer
danny
is
alive
i
feel
sure
of
that
he
s
on
his
rubber
raft
the
sea
is
but
it
may
god
will
look
after
danny
you
believe
in
god
s
care
for
his
children
don
t
you
don
t
know
i
ve
never
been
able
to
think
that
then
you
ll
have
to
trust
danny
s
duke
smiled
a
rare
smile
the
time
may
come
when
danny
will
mean
more
to
you
than
he
does
to
me
when
that
time
comes
i
shan
t
mind
you
are
a
splendid
young
lady
but
until
that
time
i
shall
have
the
right
to
say
sally
don
t
send
that
all
sally
went
limp
all
over
you
a
moment
later
after
giving
herself
a
shake
she
stood
up
i
ll
put
the
radio
away
there
ll
be
no
more
subs
for
a
time
nancy
and
i
have
been
invited
by
the
captain
to
have
our
evening
meal
with
him
at
the
officers
that
s
splendid
duke
stood
up
you
ll
enjoy
it
you
re
a
real
will
i
am
i
sally
asked
these
questions
of
herself
after
danny
s
mother
had
gone
she
did
not
know
the
answers
danny
s
mother
was
right
for
the
moment
at
least
danny
was
safe
and
quite
comfortable
after
battling
his
plane
to
a
point
where
further
struggle
and
loss
of
altitude
might
prove
fatal
he
gave
up
the
fight
and
circling
down
went
in
for
a
crash
landing
his
was
as
successful
as
any
crash
landing
can
be
between
the
time
he
hit
the
water
and
his
plane
sank
he
was
able
to
inflate
his
rubber
raft
look
into
its
equipment
and
even
salvage
a
heavy
leather
coat
he
carried
for
an
emergency
scarcely
had
he
accomplished
this
and
paddled
a
short
distance
when
the
plane
put
its
nose
into
the
water
stood
there
quivering
then
disappeared
from
sight
good
old
plane
he
murmured
as
a
strange
feeling
of
loneliness
swept
over
him
you
did
your
full
duty
you
sank
a
sub
and
probably
saved
a
ship
now
in
davy
jones
s
locker
you
can
rest
in
peace
looks
as
if
i
d
get
some
rest
too
he
thought
as
a
short
time
later
he
settled
back
against
the
soft
rounded
side
of
his
raft
a
good
long
rest
he
added
as
a
cool
damp
mist
touched
his
cheek
and
the
chill
gray
fog
came
drifting
in
when
he
first
hit
the
water
the
boom
bang
and
of
battle
were
still
in
the
air
after
that
had
come
comparative
silence
disturbed
only
by
the
low
roar
of
planes
returning
to
their
ship
a
fine
bunch
of
fellows
he
thought
as
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
finest
ever
here
s
hoping
they
all
land
a
faint
hope
remained
that
one
of
those
planes
would
get
away
to
search
for
him
when
the
fog
came
in
he
knew
that
hope
was
at
an
end
he
found
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
of
little
waves
oppressive
going
to
be
lonesome
he
thought
as
he
started
to
examine
the
gadgets
that
came
with
the
rubber
raft
there
was
a
fish
line
and
some
artificial
bait
i
ll
try
them
all
out
he
chuckled
if
i
catch
a
whopper
with
one
of
the
lures
i
ll
send
the
manufacturer
a
picture
of
it
with
a
story
he
ll
like
it
for
his
catalogue
only
i
won
t
he
murmured
a
moment
later
they
forgot
to
pack
a
candid
instead
of
a
camera
he
found
a
device
for
distilling
fresh
water
from
salt
some
iron
rations
and
a
small
bottle
of
vitamin
what
no
vitamin
d
he
roared
but
then
i
ve
heard
that
there
s
lots
of
the
sunshine
vitamin
in
the
ocean
at
that
he
settled
back
for
a
rest
even
if
worse
came
to
worst
he
was
better
off
than
those
pirates
who
had
come
after
them
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
misgiving
that
sally
allowed
herself
along
with
nancy
to
be
led
to
the
door
of
the
officers
mess
hall
that
evening
but
when
the
captain
met
them
at
the
door
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
instead
of
a
stiff
salute
things
began
looking
better
as
they
entered
the
mess
hall
they
found
all
of
the
officers
standing
in
their
places
when
the
captain
had
escorted
them
to
their
places
at
the
head
of
his
table
he
stood
smartly
erect
every
inch
a
commander
as
he
said
gentlemen
i
propose
a
salute
to
the
ladies
of
the
day
sally
scott
and
nancy
mcbride
of
the
instantly
every
man
stood
erect
and
snapped
to
a
salute
it
was
a
simple
and
impressive
ceremony
one
long
to
be
remembered
but
to
sally
s
utter
confusion
she
almost
forgot
to
return
the
salute
it
was
all
over
in
twenty
seconds
of
time
then
they
were
all
seated
in
their
places
ready
for
the
meal
that
was
to
be
quite
a
feast
in
celebration
of
a
real
victory
there
was
fried
chicken
with
cranberry
sauce
and
sweet
potatoes
fresh
crisp
celery
and
baked
squash
all
this
was
topped
with
ice
cream
and
very
fine
coffee
was
sally
conscious
of
all
this
wealth
of
good
things
well
hardly
she
was
first
of
all
tremendously
interested
in
captain
donald
macqueen
who
sat
at
her
side
all
her
life
she
had
dreamed
of
really
knowing
great
and
important
people
not
that
she
wished
to
brag
about
it
far
from
that
she
did
long
for
an
opportunity
to
study
them
to
feel
their
greatness
to
try
to
absorb
some
of
the
qualities
that
had
made
them
great
now
just
such
a
man
was
giving
the
major
portion
of
his
time
to
her
for
one
blissful
half
hour
a
young
lieutenant
had
taken
over
the
task
of
entertaining
nancy
and
he
did
not
seem
at
all
unhappy
about
it
either
important
to
sally
also
were
the
things
captain
macqueen
was
saying
to
her
this
old
friend
of
name
is
kennedy
i
be
a
great
genius
he
suggested
oh
he
is
she
beamed
but
it
does
seem
strange
that
he
should
have
entrusted
such
a
priceless
device
to
a
well
to
any
young
perhaps
it
may
seem
that
way
to
you
was
her
slow
reply
but
captain
macqueen
i
think
that
too
often
those
who
boast
of
gray
hairs
underestimate
the
dependability
the
devotion
yes
and
the
wisdom
of
the
young
people
of
she
checked
herself
i
have
worked
with
him
for
six
everything
you
say
is
his
dark
eyes
twinkled
but
such
a
priceless
invention
look
what
it
has
accomplished
us
a
victory
perhaps
saved
hundreds
of
lives
and
very
precious
cargo
miss
scott
he
leaned
close
speaking
low
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
convoys
ever
to
cross
the
atlantic
our
enemy
is
not
through
he
will
attack
again
and
yet
again
perhaps
but
if
we
can
always
know
as
we
did
today
the
hour
the
very
moment
of
his
a
boon
c
kennedy
is
a
very
old
she
was
speaking
slowly
again
he
is
an
extremely
modest
man
in
the
case
of
another
important
invention
he
met
with
disappointment
i
am
sure
he
did
not
realize
the
real
value
of
this
secret
but
now
he
shall
know
he
shall
be
richly
rewarded
of
course
the
government
will
want
to
take
over
his
invention
but
even
he
does
not
ask
for
reward
only
he
shall
have
both
and
in
good
measure
the
captain
declared
and
now
let
s
talk
for
a
little
while
about
the
radio
that
is
in
your
stateroom
right
ah
sally
thought
with
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
now
it
is
coming
of
course
you
realize
miss
scott
he
said
speaking
low
but
distinctly
that
for
the
present
and
probably
for
a
long
time
to
come
your
radio
has
value
to
the
navy
only
as
a
listening
no
she
replied
quite
frankly
i
m
not
sure
of
that
it
works
quite
well
as
a
sending
in
bringing
such
a
radio
on
board
you
must
have
realized
that
you
were
laying
yourself
open
to
serious
yes
of
then
why
did
you
do
it
his
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
that
betrayed
only
a
kindly
interest
because
i
believed
the
radio
to
be
a
great
invention
one
that
could
be
made
to
serve
my
country
and
because
i
wanted
to
bring
honor
to
a
real
you
did
not
really
mean
to
try
communicating
with
anyone
on
land
he
asked
in
a
quiet
tone
only
in
case
of
a
great
emergency
and
then
only
with
an
her
voice
was
low
i
can
think
of
no
emergency
that
would
warrant
the
sending
of
such
a
message
the
truth
is
that
such
a
message
would
be
almost
certain
to
bring
in
one
more
sub
to
hunt
us
down
that
is
not
he
was
still
speaking
in
a
low
friendly
voice
the
moment
our
enemy
realizes
that
we
are
able
to
listen
in
on
his
talk
from
sub
to
sub
that
moment
your
radio
loses
its
value
think
what
it
will
mean
if
the
escorting
vessel
in
every
convoy
should
be
able
in
the
future
to
listen
as
we
did
today
while
the
moves
in
have
sally
wet
her
dry
lips
i
shall
not
attempt
to
contact
anyone
with
my
radio
unless
you
sanction
she
swallowed
hard
not
for
that
is
being
a
good
putting
out
a
hand
he
said
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
shake
the
hand
of
a
lady
who
does
honor
to
the
they
shook
hands
solemnly
when
at
last
sally
and
nancy
found
themselves
on
the
open
deck
once
more
they
were
in
prime
condition
for
a
long
promenade
my
head
is
in
a
whirl
nancy
exclaimed
how
could
all
this
happen
to
us
we
re
just
what
danny
would
call
fools
for
kick
was
sally
s
reply
and
then
at
the
very
mention
of
danny
she
felt
an
all
but
irrepressible
desire
to
sink
down
on
the
deck
danny
too
should
have
had
a
part
in
all
this
and
where
was
he
now
the
captain
was
wonderful
she
said
to
nancy
he
must
know
how
we
feel
about
of
course
he
does
he
knows
we
all
worked
together
on
the
and
yet
he
never
once
mentioned
didn
t
he
no
and
i
think
that
is
about
the
most
wonderful
of
for
a
time
after
that
they
marched
on
in
silence
in
a
shadowy
corner
they
passed
two
other
waves
seated
on
a
pile
of
canvas
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
their
faces
after
passing
beyond
a
ladder
they
paused
to
watch
the
moon
a
faint
yellow
ball
rolling
through
the
fog
that
was
thinning
and
blowing
away
then
they
heard
one
of
the
other
waves
talking
know
who
those
girls
are
she
was
saying
they
are
the
ladies
of
the
day
imagine
her
laugh
was
not
good
to
hear
one
of
them
worked
in
a
radio
shop
the
other
was
a
radio
ham
now
they
re
the
ladies
of
the
day
and
i
gave
up
a
secretarial
job
to
act
as
yeoman
to
captain
mac
queen
isn
t
war
just
wonderful
who
is
that
girl
sally
whispered
as
she
and
nancy
hurried
on
she
s
the
old
man
s
yeoman
all
right
secretary
to
you
nancy
replied
i
recognized
her
what
s
she
got
against
us
sally
asked
in
a
puzzled
voice
that
s
for
her
to
know
and
for
us
to
find
out
said
nancy
but
she
ll
bear
watching
chapter
fifteen
danny
s
busy
day
before
falling
asleep
that
night
sally
found
two
faces
appearing
and
disappearing
before
her
tired
eyes
by
drawing
on
her
memory
she
had
been
able
to
recall
the
face
of
erma
stone
the
skipper
s
secretary
erma
was
tall
and
dark
rather
she
told
herself
she
dismissed
the
idea
that
she
might
really
be
a
foreigner
and
perhaps
a
spy
foreigners
could
not
join
the
waves
and
on
such
a
mission
as
this
all
members
would
be
chosen
with
great
care
she
s
smart
and
has
been
successful
she
thought
for
some
reason
she
does
not
like
nancy
and
me
it
may
be
pure
jealousy
because
of
the
favors
just
shown
us
or
it
may
go
much
deeper
than
that
i
ll
be
on
my
the
second
face
that
seemed
to
hang
on
the
black
wall
of
darkness
was
the
smiling
countenance
of
danny
if
she
was
troubled
about
danny
as
indeed
she
was
she
might
well
enough
have
put
her
mind
to
rest
for
at
the
moment
at
least
danny
was
doing
very
well
indeed
he
was
fast
asleep
never
given
much
to
worrying
he
had
munched
some
iron
rations
then
as
darkness
fell
had
spread
his
heavy
coat
over
him
and
using
the
side
of
the
craft
as
a
pillow
had
drifted
off
to
peaceful
slumber
his
awakening
was
rude
and
startling
something
hard
and
wet
like
a
dishrag
had
struck
him
squarely
in
the
face
he
came
up
fighting
and
clawing
one
hand
caught
the
damp
and
slimy
thing
the
thing
bit
his
fingers
but
he
hung
on
after
dragging
himself
to
a
balanced
position
he
gave
both
hands
to
conquering
the
intruder
feathers
he
muttered
a
food
from
the
at
that
he
felt
for
the
creature
s
neck
got
one
more
bite
from
the
beak
then
put
the
wandering
bird
to
rest
with
neatness
and
dispatch
hardly
had
he
accomplished
this
when
with
all
the
force
of
a
big
league
baseball
a
second
object
struck
him
squarely
in
the
chest
completely
bowled
over
he
barely
avoided
going
overboard
this
intruder
escaped
after
searching
about
he
located
a
small
flashlight
he
started
casting
its
gleams
over
the
sea
all
about
him
the
black
waters
seemed
alive
birds
he
exclaimed
thousands
of
them
he
had
not
exaggerated
a
great
host
of
sea
parrots
beating
the
water
with
their
tough
little
wings
were
making
their
way
south
from
their
summer
home
three
more
of
them
fell
into
his
small
boat
and
were
added
to
his
slender
larder
i
must
make
the
most
of
everything
he
told
himself
stoutly
men
have
lived
for
weeks
on
such
a
raft
as
at
that
after
watching
the
last
ugly
little
traveler
pass
he
once
more
drew
his
heavy
coat
over
him
and
lay
down
to
peaceful
sleep
next
morning
sally
awoke
with
mingled
feelings
of
joy
sorrow
and
fear
she
was
glad
that
the
secret
radio
had
proved
to
be
so
great
a
boon
old
could
die
happy
he
had
achieved
a
great
success
and
this
would
not
go
unrewarded
she
was
sorry
about
danny
she
would
miss
him
terribly
it
s
not
a
case
of
love
she
told
herself
almost
fiercely
we
re
just
good
pals
that
s
she
did
not
believe
in
that
word
love
it
could
stand
for
so
much
and
so
little
a
stuffy
night
on
a
dance
for
some
was
love
men
loved
their
ladies
so
well
they
killed
them
so
no
one
else
would
get
them
bah
the
word
might
as
well
be
marked
out
of
the
dictionary
perhaps
the
old
man
s
yeoman
thought
she
was
in
love
with
danny
who
could
tell
illustration
danny
watched
the
last
little
traveler
pass
it
was
this
same
yeoman
erma
stone
who
sent
a
shudder
running
through
her
being
i
won
t
think
of
it
she
sprang
from
her
berth
to
turn
on
the
secret
radio
turning
the
dials
first
this
one
then
that
for
some
time
she
caught
nothing
subs
are
far
away
this
morning
she
reported
to
riggs
in
the
radio
room
as
she
passed
on
her
way
for
coffee
bacon
and
toast
that
s
fine
sally
he
beamed
keep
up
the
good
work
as
long
as
the
weather
remains
fair
that
secret
radio
of
yours
will
be
your
assignment
yours
and
nancy
s
don
t
sit
over
it
all
the
time
but
tune
in
for
a
few
minutes
every
hour
we
can
t
afford
to
take
okay
chief
was
her
cheerful
reply
if
the
weather
gets
nasty
we
may
need
your
help
he
added
it
better
stay
her
brow
wrinkled
danny
s
out
there
the
storm
gods
don
t
care
for
danny
he
replied
soberly
nor
for
any
of
the
rest
of
riggs
she
said
coming
close
and
speaking
low
do
you
know
any
reason
why
the
captain
s
yeoman
should
not
like
me
erma
stone
no
why
doesn
t
she
like
you
i
m
afraid
you
never
know
about
riggs
looked
away
if
one
gets
a
grouch
on
me
i
keep
my
eyes
peeled
that
s
thanks
riggs
one
thing
more
do
you
think
they
will
send
a
plane
back
to
look
for
danny
why
we
ve
come
too
far
since
then
besides
a
plane
rising
from
our
ship
might
catch
the
eye
of
some
sub
commander
that
would
be
just
too
bad
this
is
a
mighty
important
sally
drank
her
coffee
in
a
cloud
of
gray
gloom
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
danny
absolutely
nothing
but
when
she
came
out
on
the
deck
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
gulls
were
sailing
high
and
all
seemed
at
peace
since
there
was
work
to
be
done
she
snapped
out
of
her
blue
mood
and
stepped
into
things
in
the
usual
manner
that
night
since
the
weather
was
still
beautiful
and
no
dangers
appeared
to
threaten
the
captain
authorized
a
dance
for
the
fliers
the
sailors
off
duty
the
nurses
and
the
waves
some
of
the
sailors
had
organized
an
orchestra
of
a
sort
two
fiddlers
two
sax
players
and
a
drummer
to
sally
this
seemed
to
offer
an
hour
of
glorious
relaxation
she
loved
dancing
and
did
it
very
well
too
it
seemed
however
that
a
whole
flock
of
gremlins
had
joined
the
ship
just
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
the
captain
was
on
hand
to
lead
off
the
first
dance
and
chose
her
as
his
partner
she
wanted
to
say
oh
captain
please
no
but
she
dared
not
so
they
led
off
the
dance
it
was
a
glorious
waltz
the
boys
jazzed
it
a
little
still
it
was
glorious
the
old
man
was
a
splendid
dancer
she
lost
herself
to
the
rhythm
and
swing
of
the
music
until
with
a
startling
suddenness
her
eyes
met
those
of
erma
stone
from
the
shock
of
that
flashing
look
of
hate
she
received
such
a
jolt
that
had
not
the
skipper
held
her
steady
she
must
have
fallen
to
the
floor
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
dizzy
i
shouldn
t
wonder
you
ve
been
working
rather
hard
and
had
a
shock
or
that
was
as
close
as
he
would
come
to
speaking
of
danny
it
s
nothing
summoning
all
her
will
power
she
pulled
herself
back
into
the
swing
and
so
the
dark
siren
was
forgotten
but
not
for
long
out
on
the
wide
open
sea
danny
had
had
a
busy
day
where
he
was
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
hot
after
breakfast
he
began
studying
his
watermaking
machine
and
in
due
time
had
water
that
was
a
little
better
than
city
water
and
not
as
good
as
that
from
the
old
oaken
bucket
on
his
uncle
s
farm
after
that
he
skinned
and
cleaned
his
birds
then
he
sliced
the
meat
thin
and
spread
it
out
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
where
the
sun
shone
hot
to
dry
that
will
do
for
dinner
tonight
he
told
himself
if
i
only
had
a
cookstove
i
d
get
along
he
would
want
something
for
supper
perhaps
a
fish
would
do
after
attaching
a
lure
to
his
line
he
cast
out
into
the
deep
at
the
third
cast
a
gray
shadow
followed
his
lure
halfway
in
then
rising
to
the
surface
it
thrust
out
a
fin
like
a
plowshare
huh
he
hauled
in
his
line
seems
to
me
this
isn
t
friday
after
he
thought
what
would
happen
if
that
shark
threw
one
flipper
over
the
side
of
his
raft
it
s
always
something
but
it
ain
t
never
nothin
he
murmured
setting
his
coat
up
as
a
shade
he
lay
down
to
avoid
the
sun
and
there
with
the
raft
lifting
and
falling
beneath
him
he
fell
to
musing
on
the
width
of
the
ocean
the
number
of
ships
passing
that
way
and
the
probability
of
a
storm
in
the
midst
of
this
his
eye
caught
a
sudden
gleam
of
light
a
dark
cloud
was
rolling
along
the
horizon
and
from
it
came
an
ominous
roar
apparently
danny
need
no
longer
wonder
about
the
probability
of
a
storm
the
flash
of
lightning
which
had
attracted
his
attention
together
with
the
rolling
thunder
which
accompanied
it
made
a
squall
at
any
rate
a
distinct
possibility
chapter
sixteen
the
dark
siren
watch
out
for
that
it
was
danny
s
flying
pal
who
spoke
the
dance
was
still
on
and
he
fred
angel
was
dancing
with
sally

mean
the
captain

yeoman
she
suggested

i
do
while
you
were
dancing
with
him
she
looked
as
if
she
d
like
to
murder
fred
why
doesn
t
she
like
me
can
t
you
guess
he
grinned
i
might
try
but
i
d
probably
be
she
thinks
her
boss
is
sweet
on
fred
that
s
ridiculous
he
s
been
good
to
me
because
i
ve
been
lucky
enough
to
help
sure
that
s
it
he
agreed
he
s
interested
in
just
one
thing
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
helping
to
bring
this
terrible
war
to
an
the
thing
that
most
of
us
are
interested
in
fred
corrected
her
some
people
never
get
their
minds
off
themselves
for
long
miss
stone
is
like
that
you
never
worked
in
a
large
organization
did
you
where
there
were
a
lot
of
really
big
shots
no
i
m
a
small
town
that
s
where
you
were
lucky
me
i
worked
with
a
big
city
outfit
and
i
saw
a
lot
of
private
secretaries
like
erma
were
they
all
like
her
most
of
them
were
the
very
successful
ones
they
work
like
slaves
do
the
boss
s
work
as
well
as
their
own
by
and
by
they
get
to
thinking
they
own
the
boss
erma
is
like
and
she
thinks
i
m
trying
to
steal
her
property
that
s
absurd
sally
laughed
that
s
just
part
of
it
erma
is
a
she
has
got
to
like
danny
pretty
well
you
don
t
blame
her
do
you
sally
spoke
with
feeling
not
a
bit
danny
s
one
of
the
swellest
guys
i
ve
ever
known
he
got
a
real
break
last
trip
sank
a
sub
all
by
himself
and
the
rest
of
us
never
even
got
a
fred
replied
with
enthusiasm
so
erma
set
a
trap
to
catch
him
too
sally
asked
that
s
what
she
did
and
now
well
you
know
the
answer
from
the
books
you
have
read
keep
an
eye
on
her
sally
she
ll
get
to
you
sooner
or
later
she
may
beat
your
time
with
the
old
man
but
never
with
danny
for
you
re
in
solid
danny
she
whispered
swallowing
hard
we
may
never
see
him
there
s
a
chance
there
but
i
m
betting
on
danny
the
dance
was
at
an
end
i
ll
keep
my
eyes
open
she
whispered
fred
her
voice
was
low
and
were
walking
slowly
toward
her
post
of
duty
will
we
go
back
the
way
we
came
no
one
knows
but
do
you
think
we
will
she
insisted
he
knew
she
was
still
thinking
of
danny
and
wanted
to
help
her
but
lies
he
knew
never
help
well
yes
he
spoke
slowly
the
old
man
will
return
this
way
for
he
never
forgets
his
boys
grand
old
boy
captain
macqueen
thanks
fred
that
really
helps
a
lot
and
fred
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
radio
cabin
if
you
are
sent
out
to
search
for
danny
on
the
way
back
will
you
take
me
along
well
now
he
pondered
yes
i
will
if
i
can
i
ll
even
let
you
stow
stowaway
that
s
a
lovely
word
she
laughed
shake
it
s
a
with
a
hearty
handclasp
they
parted
that
night
sally
insisted
on
taking
a
shift
with
riggs
blinking
out
her
messages
to
the
ships
of
the
convoy
i
want
to
do
something
besides
sitting
and
listening
for
trouble
she
told
him
truth
was
a
great
loneliness
had
come
sweeping
over
her
perhaps
the
dance
had
done
that
certainly
it
had
brought
back
memories
of
other
times
gay
days
at
high
school
when
she
joined
in
the
school
hops
which
had
not
been
so
grand
but
had
for
all
that
given
her
a
feeling
of
buoyant
youth
there
had
been
times
too
when
out
with
her
father
on
a
fishing
trip
she
had
fallen
in
with
a
jolly
crowd
and
had
danced
by
the
light
of
a
campfire
now
that
the
ship
s
dance
was
over
and
she
stood
looking
at
the
endless
black
waters
rolling
by
she
felt
very
blue
but
the
instant
the
blinker
was
in
her
hands
and
bright
little
messages
came
to
her
out
of
the
night
loneliness
fled
we
re
a
big
family
she
said
to
riggs
a
family
of
ships
he
agreed
and
on
those
ships
are
enough
people
to
populate
a
town
as
large
as
the
one
where
i
was
quite
a
young
city
he
agreed
but
it
seems
so
sad
that
they
should
all
be
carried
away
from
their
home
illustration
sally
stood
looking
at
the
endless
black
waters
some
of
them
got
pretty
tired
of
the
old
home
town
he
mused
but
boy
won
t
they
be
happy
when
they
get
a
chance
to
go
back
i
hope
it
may
be
riggs
was
a
fine
fellow
sally
liked
him
a
lot
riggs
she
said
if
i
get
into
trouble
really
serious
trouble
i
ll
come
to
you
first
you
do
just
that
he
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
you
just
spill
it
all
to
old
riggs
he
ll
pull
you
out
of
it
or
die
in
the
thanks
riggs
i
feel
so
much
it
s
the
dance
that
did
that
he
slowly
insisted
really
there
must
be
some
change
in
our
lives
or
we
break
the
old
man
knows
that
great
old
fellow
the
sally
and
nancy
worked
out
a
schedule
all
their
own
four
hours
on
and
four
off
day
and
night
turn
and
turn
about
they
stayed
by
the
secret
radio
it
seems
such
a
simple
thing
to
do
nancy
exclaimed
after
a
full
hours
of
it
yes
i
know
sally
agreed
nothing
ever
happens
i
hear
a
little
now
and
sure
so
do
i
but
it
sounds
far
away
the
subs
seem
close
together
so
they
can
t
be
so
we
just
set
the
dials
and
sit
and
listen
and
wait
but
just
think
what
has
already
happened
and
may
happen
again
yes
we
stopped
them
stopped
them
dead
ships
and
lives
would
have
been
and
so
we
must
stick
to
our
post
for
it
may
happen
all
over
in
the
quiet
days
that
followed
there
was
an
hour
of
dancing
every
night
these
were
hours
of
real
joy
for
sally
the
captain
apparently
considering
that
he
had
shown
her
all
due
courtesy
seldom
asked
for
a
dance
this
left
her
free
to
enjoy
fred
and
his
fellow
fliers
erma
stone
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
but
this
she
told
herself
was
only
a
lull
before
another
storm
one
night
while
she
stood
by
the
rail
watching
the
black
waters
roll
by
and
thinking
gloomy
thoughts
she
suddenly
found
the
captain
at
her
side
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
sally
there
was
a
mellow
tone
in
his
voice
that
i
haven
t
forgotten
danny
i
shall
never
forget
him
he
was
one
of
my
finest
i
am
hoping
our
paths
may
cross
can
they
she
asked
huskily
we
are
taking
this
convoy
to
a
certain
port
in
england
there
it
will
be
split
up
into
smaller
groups
and
convoyed
by
other
fighting
ships
to
other
that
leaves
us
free
there
was
a
glad
ring
in
her
voice
yes
we
will
follow
the
same
course
back
we
have
the
spot
where
danny
was
lost
marked
on
the
chart
and
have
a
record
of
currents
and
winds
that
may
carry
him
off
our
then
you
really
think
there
is
a
chance
most
certainly
a
real
chance
we
shall
send
out
planes
and
scour
the
what
a
pity
it
could
not
have
been
done
the
hour
he
was
the
battle
was
still
on
then
came
the
fog
after
that
we
were
far
away
and
this
great
convoy
hung
on
our
shoulders
like
a
crushing
the
skipper
sounded
old
and
very
tired
it
s
war
sally
war
god
grant
that
it
may
soon
be
at
an
as
she
returned
to
her
cabin
after
this
talk
she
had
with
the
captain
she
ran
upon
danny
s
mother
she
had
seen
her
several
times
of
late
but
they
had
never
spoken
of
danny
now
she
had
something
cheery
to
tell
come
in
duke
she
invited
i
ll
make
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
on
my
electric
plate
and
we
ll
have
a
when
the
cocoa
had
been
poured
steaming
hot
she
said
i
had
a
talk
with
the
was
it
about
danny
duke
smiled
knowingly
yes
who
else
sally
smiled
back
danny
s
all
right
that
is
up
to
sally
did
not
ask
how
she
knew
that
would
have
been
questioning
a
mother
s
faith
and
he
s
going
to
be
all
right
sally
replied
cheerfully
the
captain
says
we
are
to
turn
right
back
the
moment
we
reach
england
and
that
we
ll
have
a
look
for
that
s
fine
really
the
captain
is
a
great
and
grand
duke
was
warm
in
her
praise
sally
told
all
she
knew
danny
s
mother
beamed
her
gratitude
but
as
she
rose
to
go
a
wrinkle
came
to
her
brow
it
s
going
to
storm
she
said
i
feel
it
in
my
sally
didn
t
say
that
will
be
bad
for
she
said
nothing
at
all
just
watched
the
older
woman
as
she
walked
out
into
the
night
those
had
been
strange
hard
days
for
danny
he
was
not
long
in
learning
that
there
is
nothing
so
lonely
as
an
empty
sea
if
i
get
out
of
this
alive
he
told
himself
i
ll
always
carry
some
book
with
thin
pages
and
lots
of
reading
a
bible
a
volume
of
shakespeare
just
his
threatened
storm
turned
into
a
gentle
shower
spreading
out
his
coat
he
caught
a
quart
of
water
and
poured
it
into
a
rubber
bottle
the
supply
of
water
that
could
be
produced
by
his
still
he
knew
was
limited
and
this
might
be
a
long
journey
that
he
was
slowly
going
somewhere
he
knew
well
enough
winds
and
currents
would
see
to
that
perhaps
he
would
in
time
come
to
land
what
land
some
wild
uninhabited
island
a
friendly
shore
or
beneath
an
enemy
s
frowning
fortifications
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
at
times
he
tried
reciting
poetry
one
verse
amused
him
this
is
the
ship
of
pearl
which
poets
feign
sails
the
unshadowed
it
s
a
rubber
ship
he
told
himself
but
why
quibble
over
small
details
as
he
recalled
the
poem
it
ended
something
like
this
build
thee
more
stately
mansions
o
my
soul
as
the
swift
seasons
roll
leave
thy
past
let
each
new
new
what
well
skip
it
shut
thee
from
heaven
with
a
dome
more
vast
till
thou
at
length
art
free
leaving
thine
outgrown
shell
by
life
s
unresting
that
s
a
fine
idea
he
thought
if
i
could
make
this
rubber
raft
grow
but
i
can
t
so
i
d
better
catch
me
a
the
sharks
were
gone
his
fishing
on
that
day
met
with
marvelous
success
after
a
terrific
struggle
in
which
his
boat
was
all
but
capsized
a
dozen
times
he
succeeded
in
landing
a
king
salmon
boy
oh
boy
he
exclaimed
how
did
you
get
way
out
here
that
was
not
an
important
question
after
cutting
off
the
salmon
s
head
he
sliced
the
rich
red
steaks
into
strips
and
set
them
drying
along
the
sides
of
his
boat
take
eat
and
be
content
he
quoted
these
fishes
in
your
stead
were
sent
by
him
who
sent
the
tangled
ram
to
spare
the
child
of
he
didn
t
know
what
that
was
all
about
but
it
did
somehow
seem
to
fit
his
case
so
he
liked
it
one
evening
his
sea
was
visited
by
one
more
flight
of
small
birds
with
big
ugly
heads
by
one
device
and
another
he
captured
six
of
these
five
went
into
his
larder
but
the
sixth
being
and
innocent
got
a
new
lease
on
life
he
tied
it
to
the
boat
by
a
string
at
first
his
pet
objected
strenuously
but
in
the
end
he
settled
down
to
a
diet
of
dried
salmon
meat
and
was
content
to
sit
by
the
hour
perched
on
the
side
of
danny
s
boat
he
looked
like
a
parrot
but
try
as
he
might
danny
could
not
make
him
talk
and
then
this
young
ancient
mariner
was
visited
by
both
hope
and
despair
a
lone
boat
appeared
on
the
horizon
it
remained
there
for
hours
at
last
came
much
closer
and
then
was
swallowed
up
by
a
great
bank
of
clouds
rolling
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
chapter
seventeen
little
shepherdess
of
the
big
ships
that
same
night
after
dreaming
of
being
in
the
old
garden
swing
beneath
the
apple
tree
at
home
and
of
swinging
higher
and
higher
until
the
swing
broke
letting
her
down
on
her
head
sally
awoke
to
find
herself
standing
first
on
her
feet
and
then
on
her
head
something
is
terribly
wrong
she
thought
still
half
asleep
where
am
i
what
is
happening
just
then
her
head
did
bump
the
boards
at
the
head
of
her
berth
and
she
knew
she
was
still
aboard
the
aircraft
carrier
a
terrific
storm
had
set
the
craft
to
doing
nose
dives
and
near
somersaults
i
suppose
i
should
be
seasick
she
told
herself
but
i
am
not
not
a
bit
the
lord
be
praised
for
just
then
her
ears
caught
a
low
moan
nancy
she
exclaimed
springing
out
of
bed
what
s
happened
thing
was
the
faltering
answer
oh
sally
i
do
wish
i
could
die
on
nonsense
sally
exclaimed
you
won
t
die
you
re
seasick
that
s
all
i
ve
got
some
lea
and
perrins
sauce
in
my
bag
it
s
swell
for
seasickness
they
say
wait
i
ll
get
you
i
ll
after
downing
the
pepper
sauce
nancy
felt
a
little
better
but
hid
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
refused
to
move
sally
had
left
her
three
hours
before
listening
in
at
the
secret
radio
now
she
herself
took
a
turn
at
listening
after
a
half
hour
of
absolute
radio
silence
she
dragged
the
headset
off
her
ears
rolled
the
radio
in
her
blankets
drew
on
a
raincoat
then
slipped
out
into
the
storm
slipped
was
exactly
the
right
word
the
instant
she
was
outside
the
wind
took
her
off
her
feet
she
went
down
with
a
slithering
rush
and
slid
fifteen
feet
to
come
up
at
last
against
a
bulkhead
it
must
be
storming
she
said
to
a
sailor
who
volunteered
to
help
her
to
her
feet
shouldn
t
wonder
he
laughed
just
as
they
went
down
in
a
heap
guess
this
is
a
good
place
to
crawl
he
suggested
setting
the
example
the
wind
comes
through
here
something
fierce
so
bad
up
there
illustration
a
sailor
helped
sally
to
her
feet
following
his
example
sally
crept
on
hands
and
knees
to
a
more
sheltered
spot
then
getting
to
their
feet
and
gripping
hands
they
made
a
dash
for
it
at
the
end
of
this
wild
race
they
were
caught
by
one
more
mad
rush
of
wind
and
piled
up
against
the
radio
cabin
door
sally
was
on
top
this
she
said
is
where
i
get
off
thanks
thanks
a
she
pushed
the
door
open
allowed
herself
to
be
blown
in
then
closed
the
door
in
the
face
of
the
gale
do
you
think
it
will
storm
she
asked
riggs
who
was
there
alone
it
might
at
that
he
grumbled
he
looked
just
terrible
sally
thought
good
grief
sally
he
exploded
aren
t
you
seasick
not
a
bit
she
laughed
at
least
not
you
won
t
be
then
thank
god
for
that
how
about
taking
over
i
m
about
through
for
i
ll
be
glad
to
we
ve
had
to
give
up
blinker
signals
it
s
so
dark
you
couldn
t
see
a
watt
searchlight
besides
the
ships
go
up
and
down
so
you
d
never
get
their
messages
but
we
ve
got
to
keep
in
touch
with
every
blasted
ship
in
the
convoy
get
lost
if
we
didn
t
bang
into
one
another
and
sink
yes
i
know
we
ve
given
up
radio
silence
had
to
anyway
no
sub
pack
would
attack
in
this
howling
hurricane
we
use
sound
and
radio
to
keep
the
ships
yes
i
know
she
replied
quietly
oh
you
do
then
you
tell
even
riggs
got
a
little
peeved
at
times
when
these
lady
sailors
tried
to
tell
him
all
right
here
goes
every
two
minutes
you
give
the
call
number
of
some
ship
in
the
convoy
on
the
radio
and
then
he
began
who
s
telling
this
she
demanded
okay
sally
okay
riggs
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
you
give
a
toot
on
the
ship
s
whistle
sally
continued
at
the
same
time
you
send
out
a
radio
impulse
the
radio
sound
reaches
the
ship
instantly
the
sound
of
the
whistle
is
slower
the
signal
man
on
that
other
boat
notes
the
difference
between
the
time
of
arrival
of
radio
impulse
and
whistle
he
does
a
little
figuring
then
he
radios
his
approximate
position
in
relation
to
your
ship
after
that
you
tell
him
to
move
so
far
this
way
and
that
then
everything
is
until
next
sally
caught
her
breath
say
you
know
all
the
answers
he
laughed
not
all
but
some
of
them
she
corrected
you
don
t
have
to
be
dumb
all
the
time
even
if
you
are
a
guess
that
s
right
well
now
go
to
riggs
threw
himself
down
on
a
long
seat
that
ran
the
length
of
the
room
and
sally
took
up
her
work
for
a
full
hour
the
ship
s
whistle
spoke
and
the
radio
joined
in
sally
was
there
at
the
center
of
it
all
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
the
tanker
at
the
back
of
the
convoy
and
to
the
right
was
slipping
behind
she
advised
them
to
shovel
more
coal
the
english
packet
was
crowding
its
mate
to
the
right
she
shoved
it
out
to
sea
the
big
ocean
liner
now
a
transport
laden
with
boys
in
khaki
was
straying
and
might
get
itself
lost
she
called
it
in
a
few
the
three
liberty
ships
were
getting
too
chummy
with
one
another
she
spread
them
apart
at
the
end
of
the
hour
she
glanced
at
the
long
seat
riggs
was
gone
she
was
alone
with
the
ships
and
the
storm
with
a
little
gasp
she
returned
to
her
duties
when
she
made
the
rounds
of
the
ships
for
the
second
time
the
other
radiomen
began
to
notice
her
say
you
re
all
right
the
man
on
the
big
transport
exclaimed
over
the
radio
you
re
all
right
but
you
sound
like
a
lady
are
you
no
chance
was
the
snapping
answer
only
a
what
do
you
know
about
that
hello
sally
came
from
a
liberty
ship
how
are
you
i
saw
your
picture
in
a
movie

didn
t
she
exploded

on
over
and
i
ll
show
it
to
you
he
jibed
can
t
just
now
i
m
she
cut
him
off
at
the
end
of
two
hours
danny
s
mother
appeared
with
sandwiches
and
hot
coffee
thought
i
d
find
you
here
was
her
quiet
comment
so
you
re
the
little
shepherdess
of
the
big
sally
joined
her
in
the
laugh
that
followed
never
a
word
was
said
about
danny
nor
would
there
be
have
you
seen
nancy
sally
asked
oh
yes
don
t
you
worry
about
her
i
fixed
her
up
just
and
riggs
yes
riggs
too
he
said
to
tell
you
he
d
take
over
any
time
you
sent
for
i
m
doing
fine
i
guess
sally
smiled
and
i
m
enjoying
it
no
end
but
what
about
lieutenant
tobin
sally
asked
the
second
oh
he
s
sick
too
but
he
said
he
d
drag
himself
around
lieutenant
tobin
lurched
into
the
cabin
a
few
moments
later
very
unsteady
on
his
feet
but
fighting
to
keep
up
his
spirits
he
said
nice
storm
sally
i
never
saw
a
better
one
i
ll
take
over
thanks
lieutenant
just
send
for
me
any
time
storms
don
t
mean
much
to
lucky
girl
wish
i
was
like
sally
returned
to
her
quarters
looked
to
nancy
s
comfort
then
crept
under
the
blankets
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
when
a
sailor
pounded
on
her
door
lieutenant
tobin
s
busted
two
ribs
he
announced
he
got
slammed
against
a
stanchion
lieutenant
riggs
requests
that
you
take
i
ll
be
there
in
no
again
she
hurried
into
her
clothes
i
m
sorry
riggs
seemed
shaken
by
the
very
violence
of
the
storm
that
s
all
right
i
love
she
managed
a
smile
got
to
see
that
tobin
has
proper
care
tried
to
get
to
the
rail
know
why
a
big
wave
slammed
him
hard
it
s
terrible
this
storm
is
i
ll
relieve
you
riggs
went
away
sally
settled
back
in
her
place
never
before
had
sally
experienced
such
a
sense
of
power
she
held
many
great
ships
and
thousands
of
lives
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
some
of
them
know
i
m
a
girl
some
even
know
who
i
am
and
yet
they
trust
the
thought
made
her
feel
warm
inside
it
s
worth
the
whole
cost
just
this
she
told
herself
the
whole
cost
yes
giving
up
her
work
with
old
bidding
to
her
family
and
friends
it
was
worth
all
that
and
more
but
danny
if
she
had
lost
him
forever
she
dared
not
think
of
danny
the
very
thought
would
unnerve
her
her
work
would
suffer
she
might
make
some
terrible
blunder
one
increasing
purpose
a
very
good
man
had
said
to
her
that
s
what
we
need
in
these
terrible
one
increasing
purpose
that
was
what
she
must
have
in
this
hour
of
trial
riggs
returned
sitting
down
dizzily
he
watched
and
listened
for
a
time
then
leaning
back
he
seemed
to
go
into
a
sort
of
coma
at
the
end
of
four
hours
he
came
out
of
this
pushed
her
aside
mumbled
go
get
some
rest
then
took
over
after
fighting
her
way
down
the
deck
she
tumbled
into
her
stateroom
banged
the
door
shut
shoved
the
secret
radio
into
a
corner
rolled
the
blankets
about
her
and
fell
fast
asleep
three
hours
later
she
was
once
more
at
her
post
ll
be
here
if
you
need
riggs
threw
himself
on
the
hard
seat
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
an
hour
later
the
skipper
looked
in
upon
her
how
are
they
coming
he
asked
closing
the
door
without
a
bang
all
right
i
sally
nodded
to
a
sort
of
map
that
indicated
the
location
of
each
ship
in
the
convoy
at
any
particular
moment
he
studied
the
map
for
a
time
in
silence
that
s
fine
was
his
comment
really
first
how
s
your
yeoman
she
asked
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
his
eyes
returned
the
twinkle
she
hasn
t
bothered
me
for
quite
a
time
she
s
under
the
weather
i
he
looked
at
riggs
with
a
questioning
eye
he
s
all
right
she
hastened
to
assure
him
doing
all
he
it
s
a
terrible
storm
worst
i
ve
ever
seen
in
these
waters
i
m
having
ropes
strung
along
the
ship
you
d
better
stick
to
them
pretty
closely
we
can
t
afford
to
lose
then
he
was
gone
his
visit
had
made
her
happy
it
is
something
when
a
really
big
man
says
we
can
t
afford
to
lose
well
they
wouldn
t
lose
her
nor
even
have
occasion
to
miss
her
for
long
at
a
time
the
storm
roared
on
boats
pitched
and
tossed
the
english
packet
had
its
rigging
blown
away
the
tanker
reported
a
damaged
rudder
and
a
destroyer
went
to
her
aid
day
dawned
at
last
and
they
began
using
flags
for
signals
with
very
little
rest
buried
in
heavy
sweaters
and
slicker
sally
stood
like
a
ship
s
on
the
tower
and
signaled
all
day
long
once
nancy
came
to
take
her
place
she
lasted
for
an
hour
s
not
that
i
can
t
nancy
was
ready
to
cry
when
sally
relieved
her
it
s
this
terrible
yes
i
know
just
forget
it
the
storm
will
be
over
before
you
know
it
wasn
t
over
when
sally
went
for
a
few
hours
of
rest
but
the
clouds
were
gone
the
moon
was
out
and
because
of
possible
submarine
menace
they
had
gone
back
to
blinker
signals
at
ten
she
was
at
her
new
post
blinking
signals
time
and
again
as
the
hours
passed
waves
sent
their
spray
dashing
over
her
when
at
last
she
was
relieved
she
was
half
frozen
and
soaked
to
the
skin
to
her
surprise
when
she
reached
her
cabin
she
found
the
door
swinging
what
now
she
whispered
nancy
she
knew
had
been
removed
to
the
sick
bay
where
duke
could
look
after
her
as
she
bounced
into
the
room
slamming
the
door
after
her
she
surprised
a
tall
figure
bending
over
her
secret
radio
the
instant
she
saw
the
girl
s
face
she
gasped
it
was
erma
stone
the
captain
s
yeoman
her
face
was
a
sight
to
behold
she
had
been
sick
all
right
perhaps
she
s
delirious
sally
thought
the
instant
she
caught
the
look
of
hate
and
cunning
in
the
girl
s
eyes
she
knew
this
guess
was
wrong
what
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
i
was
sent
here
to
make
sure
you
had
not
been
sending
messages
on
this
miss
stone
stood
her
ground
how
would
you
know
whether
i
had
or
not
sally
demanded
i
you
were
not
sent
here
sally
was
rapidly
getting
in
beyond
her
depths
you
came
of
your
own
accord
why
i
don
t
know
but
i
ll
know
why
you
left
she
took
a
step
forward
dodging
past
her
the
girl
threw
the
door
open
and
was
gone
she
was
going
to
send
a
message
sally
told
herself
then
i
d
get
the
blame
she
couldn
t
do
that
there
is
no
one
to
listen
at
this
hour
of
the
night
sally
s
thoughts
broke
off
short
yes
someone
might
be
listening
the
enemy
subs
and
if
they
heard
all
her
secrets
would
be
out
had
the
girl
succeeded
in
sending
a
message
she
doubted
that
for
this
was
a
secret
radio
in
more
ways
than
one
a
brief
study
of
the
radio
assured
her
that
no
messages
could
have
been
sent
after
making
sure
of
this
she
snapped
on
her
headset
to
sit
listening
for
a
half
hour
she
caught
again
that
it
seemed
nearer
now
tomorrow
she
and
nancy
should
get
back
to
this
secret
radio
at
that
she
dragged
off
her
sodden
garments
rubbed
herself
dry
drew
on
a
heavy
suit
of
pajamas
then
rolled
up
in
her
blankets
soon
she
was
fast
asleep
and
the
storm
roared
on
chapter
eighteen
the
secret
radio
wins
again
when
sally
awoke
hours
later
the
sun
was
shining
great
billowing
waves
with
no
foam
on
their
crests
were
rolling
their
ship
up
and
down
the
worst
of
the
storm
was
over
looking
like
a
ghost
riggs
crawled
out
of
his
hole
to
resume
his
duties
even
nancy
was
back
to
her
old
normal
self
you
take
it
nice
and
easy
sally
was
riggs
s
advice
you
ve
done
a
swell
job
and
deserve
a
after
drinking
her
coffee
and
eating
toast
and
oatmeal
at
a
real
mess
table
sally
felt
swell
she
took
a
turn
or
two
along
the
deck
then
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
flight
deck
there
she
came
across
fred
quite
some
storm
he
grinned
we
had
a
heck
of
a
time
keeping
the
planes
from
taking
off
all
by
themselves
but
say
his
face
sobered
what
about
danny
what
do
you
know
about
him
out
there
on
a
rubber
raft
i
don
t
know
a
thing
and
i
try
not
to
think
about
it
was
her
solemn
reply
oh
well
some
ship
may
have
picked
him
up
and
then
again
this
storm
might
not
even
have
gone
his
fred
was
a
cheerful
soul
sally
went
back
to
the
lower
deck
in
her
own
stateroom
she
hooked
up
the
secret
radio
then
lay
propped
up
in
her
berth
listening
almost
at
once
she
caught
a
low
still
far
away
she
murmured
for
three
hours
she
lay
there
turning
dials
listening
then
turning
more
dials
now
and
then
she
dozed
off
into
a
cat
nap
but
not
for
long
she
was
disturbed
each
passing
hour
found
the
coming
in
stronger
there
was
one
particular
broadcaster
whose
code
messages
fairly
rang
in
her
ears
by
working
on
her
record
of
messages
and
her
german
dictionary
she
was
able
to
tell
that
this
particular
broadcaster
was
directing
the
course
of
several
other
subs
they
must
be
subs
she
told
herself
and
such
a
lot
of
them
twelve
or
fourteen
and
they
are
coming
this
what
did
it
mean
had
one
or
two
of
the
enemy
subs
from
that
other
pack
escaped
had
they
joined
another
larger
and
were
they
all
coming
in
to
attack
she
took
all
these
questions
to
the
captain
s
cabin
she
found
the
siren
at
her
typewriter
but
ignored
her
when
she
had
made
her
report
to
the
captain
he
said
our
radio
was
going
yesterday
that
was
unavoidable
we
may
be
attacked
how
soon
do
you
think
it
may
come
they
seem
quite
a
distance
away
it
may
be
several
hours
yet
sally
replied
thoughtfully
several
hours
i
hope
so
by
that
time
we
shall
be
in
waters
that
are
within
striking
distance
of
powerful
planes
in
england
when
we
re
sure
the
attack
is
to
be
made
we
ll
radio
for
aid
those
big
planes
will
blast
the
subs
from
the
sea
but
do
you
think
they
will
come
right
in
as
they
did
subs
i
mean
sally
asked
why
not
he
asked
seeming
a
little
surprised
perhaps
they
have
been
warned
they
may
try
some
new
trick
sally
suggested
it
s
hard
to
imagine
what
that
might
be
certainly
they
can
t
sink
our
ships
without
coming
in
where
we
are
keep
a
sharp
watch
stick
to
that
radio
of
yours
and
report
to
riggs
every
sally
returned
to
her
cabin
with
grave
misgiving
that
the
enemy
would
repeat
the
performance
of
that
other
day
seemed
improbable
there
was
of
course
a
fair
chance
that
they
did
not
know
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
that
other
sub
pack
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
had
enough
for
one
trip
nancy
said
when
sally
told
her
what
was
happening
in
war
no
one
ever
has
enough
trouble
was
sally
s
sober
reply
there
is
no
such
word
as
enough
in
the
war
god
s
dictionary
it
is
always
more
and
more
and
more
i
ve
heard
that
we
re
losing
two
hundred
ships
a
month
no
one
seems
to
know
for
sure
one
thing
is
certain
haven
t
lost
any
and
we
re
about
two
days
from
it
did
seem
after
an
hour
had
passed
and
then
another
that
this
sub
pack
was
going
to
do
just
as
the
other
had
done
as
sally
listened
turned
dials
and
waited
the
broadcasters
on
the
enemy
subs
began
to
fan
out
after
that
with
a
slow
movement
that
was
ominous
they
began
to
surround
the
convoy
after
the
circle
had
been
completed
they
started
moving
in
it
was
the
hour
before
sunset
when
she
hurried
to
the
radio
room
she
was
stammering
in
her
excitement
they
are
all
around
us
how
close
he
blinked
tired
eyes
there
s
no
way
to
know
that
she
replied
cautiously
they
ll
attack
at
dusk
always
do
you
can
t
see
the
wake
of
their
periscopes
so
well
don
t
you
think
we
should
send
for
the
big
planes
from
the
mainland
she
asked
it
may
be
too
soon
we
want
them
to
arrive
at
what
you
might
call
the
psychological
moment
wait
i
ll
ask
the
he
called
the
captain
on
the
ship
s
phone
then
stated
his
problem
you
don
t
think
so
he
spoke
into
the
phone
i
thought
that
might
be
best
sir
yes
sir
all
the
men
are
at
battle
stations
now
i
ll
wait
he
hung
up
the
skipper
says
to
wait
he
explained
he
broke
off
short
for
at
that
moment
the
lookout
sang
out
a
sub
off
the
port
off
the
port
side
came
echoing
back
at
once
there
came
the
sound
of
running
feet
of
guns
swung
to
position
and
more
shouts
subs
subs
sally
dashed
to
the
rail
just
what
she
meant
to
do
she
did
not
know
at
any
rate
it
was
never
done
for
at
that
instant
a
gun
roared
and
in
three
split
seconds
a
shell
crashed
into
the
radio
cabin
torpedo
a
voice
shouted
hard
to
port
hard
to
port
the
man
on
the
bridge
roared
with
a
sense
of
doom
sally
saw
the
radio
cabin
smashed
then
saw
a
torpedo
leave
the
sub
fascinated
terrified
she
watched
it
come
it
seemed
alive
it
played
like
a
porpoise
first
it
was
in
the
air
above
the
water
then
beneath
the
water
with
sudden
terror
she
realized
that
the
torpedo
would
strike
the
ship
directly
beneath
her
the
order
to
turn
the
ship
had
come
too
late
and
when
it
does
strike
her
knees
trembled
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
paralyzed
with
fear
the
torpedo
came
on
rapidly
now
it
was
fifty
feet
away
forty
thirty
it
dove
beneath
the
water
rose
sharply
sped
through
the
air
shaking
herself
into
action
sally
turned
and
ran
headed
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
ship
she
was
all
prepared
for
a
terrific
roar
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
rending
and
crashing
of
timbers
but
none
came
racing
headlong
she
banged
into
the
gunwale
on
the
opposite
side
to
stand
there
panting
suddenly
she
rubbed
her
eyes
then
looked
at
the
sea
it
s
gone
she
murmured
the
torpedo
is
going
away
it
must
have
plunged
low
and
gone
under
the
her
instant
of
relief
was
cut
short
by
the
realization
that
there
were
other
torpedoes
and
shells
that
the
battle
had
just
begun
and
that
a
shell
had
gone
through
their
radio
cabin
riggs
she
cried
riggs
was
in
that
cabin
she
reached
the
radio
door
just
as
two
sailors
carried
riggs
out
his
face
was
terribly
white
asking
no
questions
she
brushed
past
them
and
into
the
cabin
with
tobin
and
riggs
gone
she
must
carry
on
a
look
at
the
radio
gave
her
a
sense
of
relief
it
had
not
been
damaged
she
tested
it
and
her
heart
sank
dead
she
murmured
then
it
s
the
power
wires
they
ve
been
one
moment
for
inspection
and
she
was
gripping
a
hatchet
cutting
away
a
varnished
panel
that
hid
the
wires
finding
rubber
gloves
tape
pliers
and
a
coil
of
wire
she
set
about
the
business
of
repairing
the
wires
every
second
counts
she
told
herself
those
bombers
from
the
mainland
must
be
the
wires
had
been
connected
she
was
just
testing
out
the
radio
when
the
skipper
bounded
into
the
cabin
the
radio
he
exclaimed
can
it
be
repaired
it
has
been
repaired
it
s
working
she
replied
straightening
up
illustration
sally
saw
two
sailors
carry
riggs
out
working
thank
god
call
repeat
it
in
code
three
she
put
in
the
call
then
they
waited
suddenly
the
radio
began
to
snap
that
s
their
answer
she
said
quietly
tell
them
to
send
bombers
we
re
being
attacked
by
subs
this
he
laid
a
paper
before
her
she
set
the
accelerator
talking
again
they
waited
again
came
the
of
code
repeat
she
wired
back
the
message
was
repeated
okay
she
wired
they
re
sending
twenty
bombers
she
said
quietly
good
what
about
riggs
the
captain
asked
i
wasn
t
here
they
carried
him
out
said
sally
and
tobin
he
has
two
broken
ribs
was
the
quiet
reply
i
ll
send
you
a
young
second
lieutenant
he
knows
ll
make
sally
hated
herself
for
stammering
good
he
was
gone
had
the
enemy
gun
crew
had
their
way
sally
would
by
this
time
have
been
among
the
missing
but
thanks
to
the
timely
warning
all
the
men
of
the
aircraft
carrier
had
been
at
their
posts
when
the
sub
appeared
on
the
surface
the
instant
the
sub
poked
its
snout
out
of
the
water
the
long
noses
of
guns
were
being
trained
on
it
the
first
enemy
shot
had
crashed
into
the
radio
cabin
but
every
other
shot
went
wild
one
went
singing
over
sally
s
head
and
another
cut
a
stanchion
not
ten
feet
from
where
she
stood
but
she
had
worked
on
more
and
more
guns
were
trained
on
the
sub
a
colored
crew
chanted
mm
i
got
shoes
you
got
shoes
all
god
s
chillun
got
bang
pass
up
another
shell
brother
that
un
wrecked
the
conning
tower
ummm
i
got
shoes
you
got
bang
one
split
second
passed
and
there
came
a
terrific
explosion
the
sub
had
blown
up
by
this
time
the
enemy
s
plan
was
plain
to
see
this
sub
had
been
sent
in
to
wreck
the
ship
s
radio
at
once
then
to
sink
her
at
their
leisure
it
would
be
impossible
this
way
for
the
carrier
to
summon
aid
from
land
planes
it
was
true
that
this
task
might
have
been
taken
over
by
a
cargo
ship
or
a
destroyer
but
before
these
ships
could
know
of
the
need
it
would
be
too
late
with
the
threat
to
his
ship
removed
the
captain
ordered
his
planes
off
on
a
search
for
the
remainder
of
the
with
a
strange
feeling
at
the
pit
of
her
stomach
sally
heard
them
take
off
one
after
the
other
fred
and
all
his
comrades
she
whispered
what
will
the
score
be
now
a
youthful
face
appeared
at
the
door
i
m
second
lieutenant
burns
said
the
boy
i
was
sent
to
on
the
that
s
fine
sally
gave
him
her
best
smile
you
just
look
things
over
if
you
want
to
give
me
a
few
moments
off
it
will
be
a
blessing
straight
from
things
happen
pretty
he
smiled
back
at
her
too
she
was
rocking
a
little
on
her
feet
you
were
lucky
at
he
grinned
i
watched
those
shots
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
singing
gun
crew
one
of
those
shells
would
have
blown
this
cabin
sky
but
it
didn
sally
felt
a
little
sick
i
ll
just
get
back
to
my
secret
radio
for
a
moment
she
said
okay
i
ll
take
he
settled
down
in
his
place
the
messages
she
picked
up
on
her
radio
were
a
jumble
of
sounds
every
broadcaster
of
the
enemy
subs
was
trying
to
talk
to
every
other
we
got
their
leader
she
thought
as
her
heart
gave
a
triumphant
leap
now
they
re
all
looking
for
orders
and
getting
her
hope
for
a
quick
and
easy
victory
over
this
new
and
more
powerful
sub
pack
was
soon
dashed
to
the
ground
in
a
very
short
time
there
came
into
the
enemy
broadcasts
a
firmer
and
more
confident
note
oh
sally
exclaimed
some
other
sub
commander
has
taken
charge
of
the
pack
now
there
will
be
a
real
soon
enough
the
fliers
who
went
out
to
the
attack
found
this
to
be
true
warned
no
doubt
by
the
experience
of
that
other
sub
pack
these
subs
came
in
with
only
their
periscopes
showing
fred
who
carried
a
radioman
who
was
also
a
gunner
in
his
plane
searched
the
sea
in
vain
for
a
full
fifteen
minutes
then
suddenly
he
caught
over
his
radio
a
call
for
help
from
one
of
the
tankers
we
re
about
to
be
attacked
was
the
terse
message
only
twenty
seconds
from
that
very
tanker
fred
swung
sharply
about
barked
an
order
to
his
gunner
then
moved
in
there
s
the
sub
the
gunner
shouted
over
to
the
sighting
his
target
fred
swung
wide
and
low
aiming
at
the
white
wake
of
the
sub
s
periscope
he
let
go
a
depth
bomb
it
was
a
near
hit
and
brought
the
sub
to
the
surface
but
it
seemed
to
the
young
flier
that
she
came
up
shooting
at
least
by
the
time
they
had
swung
back
the
sub
s
gun
was
barking
hang
onto
your
shirt
fred
called
to
his
gunner
get
ready
to
mow
em
down
we
re
dropping
in
on
at
that
he
shot
straight
down
two
thousand
feet
leveled
off
with
a
wide
swoop
then
sent
a
murderous
hail
of
bullets
sweeping
across
the
sub
s
crowded
deck
as
they
passed
on
his
gunner
sent
one
more
wild
burst
tearing
at
them
on
the
sub
men
went
down
in
rows
the
sea
was
dotted
by
their
struggling
forms
those
who
remained
crowded
down
the
conning
tower
then
the
sub
for
the
time
at
least
the
tanker
and
its
priceless
cargo
were
saved
but
now
there
came
a
call
from
the
big
transport
which
carried
a
thousand
men
in
khaki
on
its
crowded
decks
she
too
was
about
to
be
attacked
sally
standing
on
the
tower
watching
ready
to
blink
signals
caught
the
message
but
could
do
nothing
the
small
english
packet
the
also
caught
the
message
small
as
she
was
and
armed
with
but
one
gun
she
moved
swiftly
in
cutting
off
the
sub
s
line
of
attack
on
the
big
transport
as
if
angered
by
this
interference
the
sub
commander
brought
his
sub
to
the
surface
prepared
to
finish
off
the
small
ship
with
gunfire
but
two
can
play
with
firearms
the
packet
carried
a
gun
crew
that
had
done
service
on
many
seas
the
foam
was
hardly
off
the
sub
when
a
shell
from
the
blasted
off
one
side
of
the
sub
s
conning
tower
the
shot
was
returned
but
without
great
harm
one
more
shot
from
the
plucky
gunners
and
the
sub
s
gun
was
out
of
commission
perhaps
after
this
beating
the
sub
s
commander
planned
to
submerge
and
leave
the
scene
of
action
whatever
his
plans
might
have
been
they
were
never
carried
out
for
a
fighter
from
the
aircraft
carrier
that
had
come
to
the
rescue
swung
low
to
place
a
bomb
squarely
on
the
sub
s
deck
the
was
showered
with
bits
of
broken
steel
as
the
sub
blew
up
with
a
great
roar
this
was
a
good
start
but
there
were
many
subs
some
of
them
very
large
without
doubt
they
had
received
orders
to
get
that
convoy
at
any
cost
for
they
kept
coming
in
fred
and
his
partner
still
scouring
the
sea
discovered
a
sub
slipping
up
on
one
of
the
liberty
ships
swinging
low
they
scored
a
near
hit
with
a
bomb
the
sub
s
periscope
vanished
was
it
a
hit
they
could
not
tell
one
more
miss
and
they
were
soaring
back
to
their
own
deck
for
a
fresh
cargo
of
death
seeing
them
coming
in
sally
handed
her
blinker
to
nancy
and
raced
down
to
find
out
how
things
were
going
it
s
bad
enough
was
fred
s
instant
response
we
ve
lost
one
plane
to
aa
fire
but
the
pilot
bailed
out
and
was
picked
up
by
a
destroyer
a
sub
scored
a
hit
on
one
of
the
liberty
ships
but
it
is
all
shored
up
and
holding
its
own
if
only
those
big
bombers
from
england
would
come
his
brow
wrinkled
well
i
ll
be
seein
he
climbed
into
his
plane
and
was
once
more
in
the
air
if
only
those
big
bombers
would
come
sally
echoed
his
words
as
she
returned
to
the
tower
now
once
again
a
large
sub
apparently
assigned
to
the
task
slipped
in
close
to
the
aircraft
carrier
and
life
on
board
became
tense
indeed
two
additional
airplanes
were
thrown
into
the
battle
one
of
these
brought
the
sub
to
the
surface
with
a
depth
charge
sally
drew
in
a
deep
breath
as
she
saw
the
sub
s
size
big
as
a
regular
ship
she
murmured
to
herself
and
twice
as
dangerous
said
the
young
lieutenant
who
stood
at
her
side
the
truth
of
this
was
not
long
in
proving
itself
for
suddenly
a
shell
went
screaming
past
them
and
a
second
tore
bits
of
the
tower
away
but
the
sub
was
not
having
things
all
her
own
way
a
daring
young
flier
swooped
low
to
pour
a
deadly
fire
across
her
bow
for
a
moment
her
guns
were
silenced
but
no
longer
this
time
she
directed
her
fire
skyward
and
with
deadly
effect
a
fighter
some
three
thousand
feet
in
the
air
was
hit
and
all
but
cut
in
two
oh
sally
exclaimed
they
got
that
she
knew
the
plane
and
the
boys
who
flew
her
now
her
eyes
were
glued
on
the
sky
her
lips
parted
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
a
parachute
blossomed
in
the
sky
but
where
was
the
other
one
it
never
blossomed
the
plane
came
hurtling
down
to
vanish
instantly
if
only
those
big
bombers
would
come
sally
s
cry
was
one
of
anguish
she
could
not
stand
seeing
those
fine
boys
go
down
to
death
another
shell
sped
across
their
deck
at
the
same
time
there
came
again
the
cry
torpedo
off
the
port
once
more
with
terror
in
her
eyes
sally
watched
a
torpedo
speed
toward
the
broad
side
of
their
ship
this
time
it
seemed
it
could
not
miss
but
again
came
that
strange
hum
as
the
gun
crew
began
to
sing
i
got
shoes
you
got
there
was
a
splash
close
to
the
speeding
torpedo
and
another
and
yet
another
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
gun
could
fire
so
fast
and
then
an
explosion
rocked
the
ship
what
had
happened
sally
had
looked
away
for
the
moment
that
s
some
gun
crew
the
lieutenant
exclaimed
they
just
blew
that
torpedo
out
of
the
wonderful
sally
exclaimed
all
the
same
this
can
t
last
there
are
too
many
of
those
subs
i
do
wish
the
big
bombers
would
as
if
in
answer
to
her
prayer
there
came
a
great
rumbling
in
the
clouds
that
hung
high
over
them
in
the
evening
sky
and
suddenly
as
if
it
had
seen
all
and
had
been
sent
to
deliver
them
from
the
giant
sub
a
bomber
came
sweeping
down
as
sally
watched
breathless
she
saw
a
dozen
white
spots
emerge
from
the
big
bomber
and
come
shooting
down
it
was
strange
at
first
they
seemed
a
child
s
toy
then
they
were
like
large
arrows
with
no
shafts
just
heads
and
feathered
ends
and
then
they
were
a
line
of
bombs
speeding
toward
their
target
she
watched
eyes
wide
lips
parted
as
they
hit
the
sea
the
first
one
fell
short
and
the
second
and
third
and
then
once
more
there
was
a
roar
a
direct
hit
the
young
lieutenant
shouted
that
does
when
the
smoke
and
spray
had
drifted
away
sally
saw
the
giant
sub
standing
on
one
end
then
as
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
gilded
it
with
a
sort
of
false
glory
the
sub
slowly
sank
from
sight
oh
sally
breathed
how
grand
for
all
that
there
was
a
sinking
feeling
at
the
pit
of
her
stomach
the
men
on
that
sub
too
were
human
and
some
were
very
young
illustration
they
watched
breathlessly
as
the
bomb
struck
suddenly
the
sky
was
full
of
giant
bombers
and
the
air
noisy
with
the
shouts
of
thousands
of
voices
welcoming
the
deliverers
here
sally
handed
the
blinker
to
nancy
take
this
i
ve
just
thought
of
something
that
needs
at
that
she
sped
away
a
moment
later
sally
was
in
her
stateroom
listening
to
the
secret
radio
the
question
uppermost
in
her
mind
at
that
moment
was
how
will
the
enemy
subs
take
this
new
turn
in
the
battle
she
had
the
answer
very
soon
they
were
not
taking
it
at
first
there
came
a
series
of
hurried
and
more
or
less
jumbled
messages
from
very
close
in
after
that
the
enemy
radio
messages
settled
down
and
were
spaced
farther
apart
each
new
burst
of
came
in
more
faintly
which
meant
that
the
subs
were
withdrawing
when
at
last
she
was
sure
that
for
the
time
the
fight
was
over
she
hurried
to
the
captain
s
cabin
the
subs
have
withdrawn
she
announced
good
the
captain
exclaimed
how
far
are
they
still
withdrawing
that
s
hard
to
tell
sally
replied
cautiously
they
ll
withdraw
for
now
he
prophesied
and
come
back
to
the
attack
at
dawn
their
theory
will
be
that
the
big
bombers
will
have
to
return
to
their
land
which
they
that
s
right
but
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
return
at
dawn
if
there
is
still
work
for
them
to
do
our
enemy
does
not
yet
realize
that
thanks
to
your
secret
radio
we
can
keep
track
of
their
movements
perhaps
we
can
catch
them
off
guard
at
dawn
and
finish
them
that
the
captain
added
will
depend
on
you
and
your
secret
it
s
a
terrible
responsibility
was
the
girl
s
quiet
reply
but
i
accept
it
i
shall
be
listening
all
through
the
that
night
will
live
long
in
sally
s
memory
she
slept
not
at
all
at
all
hours
the
headset
was
over
her
ears
at
first
there
were
few
messages
passing
from
sub
to
sub
they
are
sleeping
she
told
herself
then
the
lines
of
a
very
old
poem
ran
through
her
mind
at
midnight
in
his
guarded
tent
the
turk
lay
dreaming
of
the
hour
when
greece
her
knee
in
suppliance
bent
should
tremble
at
his
power
there
will
be
no
trembling
she
told
herself
stoutly
she
knew
that
all
had
been
arranged
if
she
reported
that
the
subs
were
again
moving
in
to
the
attack
the
big
land
bombers
would
be
notified
and
would
return
to
surprise
the
wary
foe
but
would
the
subs
attack
only
time
could
tell
at
the
eerie
hour
of
three
in
the
morning
she
began
picking
up
messages
sent
from
sub
to
sub
some
near
some
far
away
i
think
reinforcements
are
coming
in
she
phoned
the
skipper
who
was
at
the
bridge
good
then
we
will
have
more
to
destroy
was
his
reply
the
hour
before
dawn
came
at
last
and
with
it
the
enemy
subs
at
least
ten
in
number
slowly
closing
in
with
a
radio
message
sent
to
the
mainland
they
could
but
wait
the
dawn
this
time
confident
of
success
and
eager
for
the
kill
the
subs
surfaced
and
came
racing
in
they
were
met
by
bombs
from
every
plane
the
aircraft
carrier
could
muster
and
from
thirty
land
bombers
as
well
their
rout
was
complete
and
the
destruction
insofar
as
could
be
learned
was
to
them
a
great
disaster
leaving
the
bombers
to
finish
the
job
the
convoy
steamed
on
toward
its
destination
chapter
nineteen
oh
danny
boy
in
the
hours
that
followed
every
nerve
was
tense
they
had
won
another
battle
but
not
without
loss
the
terrors
of
war
at
sea
had
come
to
stand
out
before
every
wave
on
board
in
sharper
reality
than
ever
before
it
was
so
with
sally
and
nancy
they
had
volunteered
for
sea
duty
and
as
long
as
their
services
in
this
capacity
were
required
there
would
be
no
turning
back
the
spirit
of
youth
that
had
flowed
in
their
veins
as
they
boarded
the
ship
only
a
few
days
before
was
being
exchanged
for
sterner
stuff
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
all
was
the
question
of
enemy
subs
twice
they
had
been
defeated
but
the
convoy
they
had
hoped
to
destroy
was
priceless
would
they
strike
again
throughout
one
long
sleepless
night
both
sally
and
nancy
hovered
over
their
secret
radio
the
of
strange
enemy
broadcasts
was
coming
in
constantly
there
were
still
plenty
of
subs
about
at
first
they
appeared
to
be
scattered
far
apart
but
in
time
they
seemed
to
be
assembling
for
attack
every
hour
sally
reported
to
the
captain
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
exact
position
of
this
sub
pack
at
three
in
the
morning
huge
bombers
hovering
overhead
were
radioed
a
message
and
they
went
zooming
away
in
the
bright
moonlight
an
hour
later
a
message
came
in
that
they
had
surprised
two
large
subs
on
the
surface
probably
engaged
in
charging
batteries
and
had
sunk
them
both
just
before
dawn
sally
tired
but
happy
reported
to
the
captain
the
loss
of
those
two
subs
seems
to
have
broken
the
pack
what
s
happening
now
he
asked
they
re
spreading
out
their
messages
are
perhaps
they
have
given
it
up
and
are
heading
for
their
home
ports
if
so
that
s
good
news
in
less
than
hours
we
shall
be
safe
in
oh
happy
day
sally
exclaimed
and
it
was
indeed
a
happy
day
when
with
her
convoy
every
precious
ship
of
it
safe
the
aircraft
carrier
dropped
anchor
in
a
broad
harbor
a
small
puffing
tug
came
alongside
to
take
members
of
the
crew
who
had
been
granted
shore
leave
to
the
dock
among
these
were
sally
nancy
erma
stone
riggs
and
duke
sally
nancy
and
danny
s
mother
stuck
close
together
once
they
entered
the
streets
of
the
only
european
city
they
had
ever
known
so
this
is
merry
england
said
nancy
it
doesn
t
seem
very
and
indeed
it
did
not
a
heavy
fog
hung
over
the
city
the
streets
were
narrow
and
dark
the
people
were
poorly
dressed
they
seemed
overworked
and
weary
they
are
merry
in
a
way
all
the
same
said
sally
take
a
look
at
their
nancy
did
just
that
and
was
amazed
in
every
face
was
the
glorious
light
of
hope
how
can
you
be
happy
after
so
many
months
of
war
sally
asked
of
a
very
old
lady
oh
the
americans
are
coming
the
cracked
old
voice
replied
you
are
an
american
aren
t
you
she
asked
peering
at
sally
s
blue
uniform
yes
of
course
i
m
a
oh
a
lady
soldier
no
a
lady
sailor
sally
laughed
then
you
were
in
the
convoy
that
just
came
the
woman
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
how
many
of
your
ships
did
they
get
sally
hesitated
she
looked
the
woman
over
she
was
english
from
head
to
toe
she
was
old
and
tired
hungry
too
yet
she
dared
be
cheerful
she
wanted
good
news
well
then
she
should
have
it
not
a
ship
she
whispered
oh
then
you
brought
us
good
luck
the
old
woman
cackled
joyously
you
must
come
again
and
i
think
i
shall
said
sally
it
s
been
truly
wonderful
and
terrible
she
whispered
to
herself
when
the
old
woman
had
moved
on
sally
put
a
hand
in
her
coat
pocket
then
laughed
low
in
that
pocket
was
a
present
for
someone
a
little
farther
on
they
overtook
a
small
girl
she
was
thinly
clad
her
thin
face
appeared
pinched
by
the
fog
and
cold
see
i
have
a
present
for
you
said
sally
taking
her
hand
out
of
the
pocket
in
the
hand
were
two
eggs
she
had
saved
them
from
her
breakfast
the
girl
s
eyes
shone
but
she
did
not
take
the
eggs
instead
she
grasped
sally
by
the
hand
after
leading
her
down
a
narrow
alley
she
opened
a
door
in
the
brick
wall
then
stood
politely
aside
while
sally
nancy
and
duke
walked
in
illustration
see
i
have
a
present
for
you
said
sally
the
room
they
entered
was
a
small
kitchen
it
was
scrupulously
clean
beside
a
small
fire
on
an
open
hearth
stood
the
girl
s
mother
oh
you
have
brought
us
company
mary
she
exclaimed
these
fine
ladies
from
the
boats
won
t
you
be
seated
she
invited
oh
we
won
t
stay
sally
smiled
i
offered
mary
two
eggs
i
saved
them
just
for
her
why
didn
t
she
take
them
two
eggs
in
the
middle
of
the
month
the
mother
exclaimed
that
is
unheard
of
one
egg
at
the
first
of
each
month
that
is
all
we
are
but
if
the
eggs
are
a
present
from
america
sally
insisted
oh
that
is
the
woman
s
face
beamed
then
you
and
mary
shall
each
have
an
extra
sally
placed
them
on
the
table
may
god
bless
the
woman
was
close
to
tears
that
said
danny
s
mother
once
they
were
on
the
street
is
why
we
all
those
ships
sally
exclaimed
and
all
safe
i
ve
been
told
that
our
convoy
brought
three
shiploads
of
food
will
win
the
war
said
nancy
we
ll
come
sally
s
impatience
grew
with
every
passing
hour
why
weren
t
they
heading
back
every
hour
s
delay
seemed
a
crime
for
danny
was
still
out
there
on
the
tossing
sea
or
was
he
she
dared
still
to
hope
we
ll
be
heading
back
just
as
soon
as
we
take
on
fuel
and
get
our
clearance
said
the
captain
i
m
as
anxious
to
be
moving
as
you
are
and
once
we
get
started
we
ll
really
make
time
when
it
s
not
hampered
by
a
convoy
our
ship
can
do
close
to
thirty
knots
we
ll
steer
a
straight
course
it
won
t
be
long
once
we
are
on
our
sally
did
not
say
long
before
what
she
knew
he
meant
long
before
they
reached
the
spot
where
danny
had
last
been
seen
the
skipper
never
forgets
one
of
his
boys
had
been
riggs
s
word
for
it
and
he
never
fails
to
do
all
he
can
for
on
the
second
day
nancy
remained
on
board
but
sally
and
danny
s
mother
once
again
went
ashore
the
time
will
pass
quicker
that
way
duke
said
yes
and
while
we
are
in
england
we
should
see
all
we
can
of
the
english
people
the
more
we
learn
of
them
the
more
we
ll
know
the
things
we
re
fighting
by
they
were
ready
for
a
rest
seeing
a
throng
entering
a
service
club
they
followed
an
entertainment
was
in
progress
a
group
of
tommies
was
putting
on
an
amusing
skit
about
life
on
the
african
front
when
this
was
done
the
band
from
sally
s
own
ship
came
on
the
platform
to
give
the
english
people
a
taste
of
real
american
swing
tunes
they
were
received
with
hilarious
applause
then
a
beautiful
lady
in
a
gorgeous
costume
mounted
the
platform
and
as
a
pianist
gave
her
the
chords
began
to
sing
she
had
a
marvelous
deep
voice
being
english
and
having
known
the
cruel
war
as
only
the
english
people
do
she
sang
with
power
and
feeling
the
song
was
entitled
danny
come
on
sally
whispered
with
something
like
a
sob
i
can
t
listen
to
all
of
that
let
s
get
they
did
hear
more
for
as
they
moved
down
the
aisle
and
out
into
the
open
air
the
words
were
wafted
back
to
them
after
walking
away
a
little
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
at
the
edge
of
a
narrow
square
neither
spoke
there
was
no
need
the
rare
bright
sun
came
out
to
bless
them
from
the
harbor
came
the
hoarse
call
of
a
ship
s
whistle
sally
wished
it
were
her
own
but
knew
it
was
not
then
suddenly
another
sound
reached
their
ears
the
rather
laugh
that
could
only
come
from
the
throat
of
an
american
sally
looked
back
it
was
erma
stone
who
had
laughed
her
arm
was
linked
in
that
of
an
admiral
she
had
had
a
shampoo
her
suit
was
pressed
she
looked
like
a
million
and
was
beaming
on
the
admiral
in
a
dazzling
manner
life
is
strange
sally
whispered
to
her
companion
yes
child
was
the
solemn
reply
very
very
that
night
sally
was
awakened
by
the
throb
of
the
ship
s
motors
they
were
on
their
way
back
chapter
twenty
a
gleam
from
the
sea
as
she
lay
there
in
her
berth
still
too
tired
and
dreamy
to
do
more
than
think
all
the
events
of
the
past
few
months
seemed
to
pass
in
review
before
her
mind
s
eye
she
saw
herself
a
normal
young
lady
in
a
normal
slightly
humdrum
world
going
her
regular
daily
rounds
work
at
the
shop
during
the
day
dinner
with
her
father
at
night
and
after
that
an
easy
chair
and
a
book
varied
now
and
then
by
a
party
or
a
ride
in
the
moonlight
some
life
she
whispered
had
it
been
she
did
not
really
know
she
found
herself
longing
for
it
now
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
way
but
would
she
be
happy
there
now
she
doubted
that
and
then
again
she
saw
herself
at
the
great
airport
directing
huge
bombers
and
other
planes
to
their
places
on
the
field
with
silent
storm
as
her
guide
instructor
and
friend
she
had
lived
a
happy
life
the
work
she
had
been
doing
had
been
important
very
important
one
false
move
one
misdirected
training
bomber
and
a
dozen
fine
young
men
from
colorado
vermont
have
gone
crashing
to
earth
silent
storm
she
whispered
a
grand
friend
barbara
a
good
staunch
pal
i
am
going
back
to
the
speedy
aircraft
carrier
seemed
to
fairly
leap
along
carrying
her
home
to
america
shall
i
stay
there
always
she
asked
herself
to
this
question
she
found
no
certain
answer
probably
she
would
not
be
the
one
to
answer
that
question
this
trip
made
by
a
dozen
waves
had
been
an
experiment
had
it
been
successful
would
it
be
repeated
she
could
not
tell
she
found
herself
hoping
it
might
be
for
the
good
of
others
as
well
as
herself
the
captain
had
told
her
that
on
this
trip
his
men
had
been
happier
steadier
more
contented
than
ever
before
ladies
add
a
touch
to
every
organization
that
can
be
had
in
no
other
that
was
his
way
of
putting
it
on
shore
in
the
harbor
city
many
fine
american
boys
were
located
she
had
talked
to
some
of
them
one
boy
had
said
you
don
t
know
what
it
means
to
meet
an
american
girl
over
why
not
she
asked
herself
now
almost
fiercely
if
the
boys
can
die
for
their
country
why
not
the
girls
as
well
thousands
of
good
english
women
died
in
the
terrible
bombings
but
the
others
never
yes
she
was
sure
that
she
wanted
to
stay
with
the
ship
to
sail
the
sea
to
do
her
bit
to
fight
and
die
if
need
be
for
her
beloved
land
but
would
they
let
her
only
time
could
tell
after
listening
in
vain
for
any
sound
of
enemy
subs
she
drew
on
slacks
slippers
and
a
heavy
bathrobe
and
went
out
on
the
deck
as
she
passed
along
toward
the
ladder
leading
to
the
flight
deck
above
she
saw
gunners
standing
like
wax
statues
by
their
guns
there
won
t
be
any
subs
tonight
she
paused
to
whisper
i
have
had
my
radio
on
for
half
an
hour
not
a
perhaps
not
was
the
low
response
but
the
skipper
isn
t
taking
any
boy
we
gave
them
subs
plenty
comin
over
came
from
another
statue
i
ll
bet
we
got
twenty
of
not
that
many
old
kentuck
said
another
statue
but
plenty
and
they
say
it
s
on
account
of
one
of
them
waves
having
some
queer
sort
of
radio
great
little
dame
i
d
sure
brought
us
a
lot
of
luck
said
the
first
shadow
they
haven
t
recognized
me
sally
thought
feeling
all
sort
of
good
inside
and
i
won
t
tell
them
that
would
spoil
it
i
ve
always
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
be
famous
if
nobody
ever
found
it
wrapping
her
robe
a
little
more
tightly
about
her
she
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
flight
deck
where
she
could
get
a
better
view
of
the
sea
the
view
was
worth
the
climb
riding
high
the
moon
had
painted
a
path
of
gold
across
the
sea
they
were
heading
into
the
wind
they
cut
across
long
lines
of
low
waves
all
this
made
the
boat
seem
to
race
like
mad
over
the
sea
it
won
t
be
long
now
she
whispered
then
her
heart
sank
three
days
the
old
man
had
said
three
days
and
we
ll
be
near
the
spot
where
danny
was
last
oh
danny
boy
she
sang
softly
oh
danny
boy
something
stirred
she
turned
about
danny
s
mother
stood
beside
her
m
sorry
she
said
i
didn
t
know
you
were
there
or
i
wouldn
t
have
sung
it
was
lovely
the
woman
s
voice
was
low
out
here
where
you
can
catch
the
full
sweep
of
the
sea
he
seems
very
near
tonight
i
wish
you
would
sing
it
so
again
softly
sally
began
to
sing
oh
danny
he
is
in
god
s
hands
tonight
and
god
s
hands
are
good
hands
said
the
mother
no
matter
whether
danny
comes
back
or
not
i
want
to
stay
with
danny
s
least
until
the
ship
goes
down
to
be
with
for
some
time
after
that
they
stood
there
in
silence
looking
away
at
the
sea
and
at
the
path
of
gold
that
seemed
to
lead
to
danny
from
that
night
on
to
sally
every
throb
of
the
great
ship
s
engines
seemed
to
be
the
beating
of
a
mighty
heart
a
throbbing
that
each
hour
brought
them
nearer
to
a
spot
where
they
might
have
a
tryst
with
life
or
death
on
the
second
night
as
she
stood
alone
on
the
upper
deck
now
watching
the
dark
waters
swirl
by
and
now
lifting
her
face
to
the
sky
where
a
million
stars
shone
she
was
joined
by
the
skipper
captain
she
said
after
a
few
moments
of
talk
where
s
your
lady
yeoman
i
haven
t
seen
her
since
we
left
port
is
she
ill
he
rumbled
miss
stone
isn
t
with
us
anymore
i
traded
her
to
an
admiral
for
a
young
man
and
two
very
fine
old
french
etchings
i
like
the
etchings
they
just
hang
on
the
wall
and
don
t
say
a
he
laughed
in
a
dry
sort
of
way
but
miss
stone
must
have
been
a
good
yeoman
she
gave
up
a
very
fine
position
to
join
the
waves
sally
suggested
yes
that
s
true
she
did
but
in
this
man
s
war
in
fact
any
war
it
s
not
the
wonderful
things
you
have
done
in
the
past
it
s
what
you
can
do
now
that
counts
not
to
the
strong
is
the
battle
he
quoted
not
to
the
swift
is
the
race
but
to
the
true
and
the
the
faithful
always
the
faithful
sally
he
repeated
most
of
the
girls
we
took
on
trial
have
been
very
fine
you
sally
and
your
pal
nancy
may
stay
on
my
ship
as
long
as
she
flies
the
stars
and
stripes
and
sails
the
seas
i
ll
even
offer
you
the
honor
of
going
over
her
side
with
me
when
the
subs
get
her
and
she
prepares
to
sink
beneath
the
they
ll
never
get
her
sally
declared
stoutly
but
captain
i
wish
to
thank
you
from
deep
in
my
heart
those
are
the
finest
words
i
ve
ever
heard
they
were
spoken
from
the
heart
for
a
time
after
that
they
were
silent
then
sally
spoke
in
a
deep
voice
captain
do
you
really
think
we
ll
find
danny
only
time
will
tell
we
have
taken
account
of
wind
and
tide
done
everything
we
could
when
we
think
we
have
located
the
approximate
spot
we
ll
heave
to
and
send
out
a
full
complement
of
planes
to
search
for
but
the
storm
she
whispered
hoarsely
it
seems
from
reports
i
have
received
i
am
led
to
believe
that
the
storm
may
not
have
passed
over
danny
s
part
of
the
ocean
it
was
a
tropical
storm
violent
in
intensity
but
narrow
in
oh
she
breathed
if
that
is
only
true
if
it
it
won
t
be
long
now
sally
tonight
we
ll
say
a
prayer
for
let
s
do
she
whispered
captain
she
spoke
again
when
the
planes
go
out
on
the
search
may
danny
s
pal
fred
fly
a
and
may
i
ride
in
the
second
seat
yes
sally
you
just
tell
fred
i
said
he
must
take
you
for
a
few
moments
later
she
was
back
in
her
quarters
saying
her
prayer
for
danny
the
hour
came
at
last
when
on
a
wide
open
sea
the
big
ship
came
to
a
halt
turned
half
about
to
give
the
planes
the
advantage
of
the
wind
then
stood
by
while
one
by
one
they
roared
away
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
sally
thought
as
she
strapped
on
her
parachute
would
it
be
a
sad
or
a
happy
ending
she
dared
not
hazard
a
guess
she
did
not
dare
to
hope
their
plane
was
slower
in
its
upward
climb
than
any
that
had
gone
before
our
plane
seems
tired
she
said
to
fred
that
s
because
i
m
carrying
an
extra
gas
tank
lashed
to
the
fuselage
he
explained
we
may
not
find
danny
but
we
ll
be
the
last
ones
back
from
the
after
sailing
aloft
they
began
to
circle
while
with
powerful
binoculars
sally
searched
the
sea
for
some
sign
a
speck
of
white
a
dark
drifting
object
just
anything
that
spoke
of
life
as
the
moments
passed
their
circle
grew
ever
wider
slowly
the
big
ship
faded
into
the
distance
from
time
to
time
with
eager
eyes
sally
lifted
her
glasses
to
scan
the
sky
and
count
the
planes
slowly
soaring
there
she
hoped
against
hope
that
one
of
these
might
show
some
sign
of
an
all
important
discovery
but
still
they
circled
on
at
last
she
saw
them
one
by
one
start
winging
their
way
back
toward
the
carrier
their
gas
is
about
gone
said
fred
will
they
refuel
and
come
back
sally
asked
there
was
a
choke
in
her
voice
and
an
ache
in
her
heart
i
don
t
know
was
the
solemn
reply
that
s
up
to
the
big
danny
s
out
here
somewhere
she
insisted
he
just
must
still
they
circled
on
suddenly
sally
cried
look
fred
way
off
there
to
the
left
there
s
a
bright
gleam
on
the
water
a
sun
spot
was
the
quiet
response
we
often
see
them
on
the
water
you
don
t
think
danny
would
set
fire
to
his
raft
do
you
no
but
fred
she
gripped
his
arm
in
her
excitement
i
read
about
it
in
a
read
what
about
some
chemical
i
can
t
remember
the
name
when
you
pour
it
on
the
water
it
throws
back
the
light
of
the
sun
makes
the
water
never
heard
of
oh
yes
fred
it
s
true
at
first
the
chemical
didn
t
work
so
well
it
disappeared
too
soon
but
they
mixed
it
with
other
chemicals
then
it
lasted
for
a
long
time
they
were
going
to
put
small
bottles
of
it
on
the
rubber
rafts
it
just
must
be
true
she
pounded
him
on
the
back
we
ll
soon
he
headed
the
plane
toward
that
gleaming
spot
for
a
time
the
light
gleamed
brightly
then
it
began
to
fade
oh
it
can
t
fail
us
sally
whispered
it
just
can
t
it
s
our
last
and
it
did
not
fail
them
for
as
sally
watched
through
her
binoculars
a
dark
spot
appeared
at
the
center
of
the
fading
light
it
s
danny
she
cried
it
just
has
to
be
and
it
was
the
small
bottle
of
chemicals
was
not
a
dream
but
a
blessed
reality
danny
had
discovered
it
and
had
used
it
at
just
the
right
time
as
they
circled
low
he
stood
up
and
waved
excitedly
fred
got
off
a
message
to
the
boat
they
promised
to
send
a
fast
power
boat
to
the
spot
at
once
after
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
circle
over
the
spot
and
wait
as
sally
s
eye
caught
the
gray
spot
that
was
the
rescue
boat
a
sudden
impulse
seized
her
fred
i
m
going
to
jump
she
said
what
take
to
the
parachute
why
we
ve
got
plenty
of
gas
for
getting
back
to
the
all
the
same
i
m
going
to
jump
i
want
to
be
with
danny
when
the
boat
arrives
nothing
will
happen
to
me
i
ve
done
it
sally
pulled
off
her
shoes
all
right
he
agreed
but
wait
until
the
boat
is
almost
impatiently
sally
waited
at
last
she
said
now
here
i
go
over
the
side
she
went
she
pulled
the
ripcord
the
parachute
opened
then
she
went
drifting
down
her
aim
had
been
good
she
hit
the
water
not
a
hundred
yards
from
danny
s
raft
after
releasing
herself
from
her
parachute
she
went
into
the
australian
crawl
and
soon
was
there
at
the
raft
s
side
danny
would
have
welcomed
anyone
after
his
long
days
on
the
sea
but
to
have
sally
drop
from
the
sky
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
danny
s
pet
sea
parrot
however
was
not
so
friendly
he
had
become
very
fond
of
danny
particularly
fond
of
his
dried
fish
he
didn
t
propose
to
have
anyone
come
between
him
and
danny
so
with
his
beak
he
had
taken
a
firm
grip
on
one
of
sally
s
pink
toes
by
the
time
danny
had
settled
the
quarrel
between
sally
and
his
pet
the
boat
was
at
their
side
danny
are
you
all
right
his
mother
cried
from
the
boat
oh
sure
fit
as
a
fiddle
and
i
have
lots
more
brain
cells
i
ve
been
living
on
he
laughed
gaily
when
the
raft
the
pet
sea
parrot
all
danny
s
dried
fish
and
of
course
danny
and
sally
had
been
taken
aboard
the
boat
headed
for
the
carrier
danny
sally
asked
how
did
you
ever
ride
out
that
storm
illustration
she
hit
the
water
near
danny
s
raft
that
why
that
was
easy
was
his
smiling
reply
you
see
i
didn
t
really
get
the
worst
of
it
just
the
aftermath
big
rolling
waves
high
as
a
church
just
rolling
and
rolling
i
went
to
the
top
of
one
slid
down
its
side
then
started
up
another
talk
about
your
roller
coaster
say
that
s
tame
needless
to
say
both
sally
and
danny
ate
at
the
captain
s
table
that
night
when
danny
had
told
of
his
glorious
fishing
expedition
when
sally
had
added
the
story
of
the
rescue
and
the
sea
parrot
had
screamed
his
approval
the
applause
that
followed
made
the
bulkheads
ring
chapter
dreams
the
moment
they
were
tied
up
at
the
dock
in
their
home
port
captain
macqueen
got
in
touch
with
silent
storm
i
understand
you
know
this
inventor
kennedy
he
said
over
the
phone
how
well
do
you
know
him
quite
well
i
think
was
storm
s
modest
reply
fine
said
macqueen
how
about
having
dinner
with
my
friend
sally
and
me
tonight
that
will
be
a
pleasure
said
silent
storm
sensing
at
once
that
something
big
regarding
sally
s
secret
radio
was
in
the
offing
but
why
don
t
we
have
the
dinner
at
my
house
it
s
quiet
and
very
that
s
okay
with
me
was
the
prompt
reply
make
it
seven
o
clock
said
storm
sally
and
i
will
be
and
they
were
when
sally
had
enjoyed
one
more
delightful
dinner
in
the
storm
home
she
was
led
away
once
more
to
silent
storm
s
secret
den
there
over
black
coffee
the
three
of
them
talked
over
the
future
i
have
asked
you
to
take
a
part
in
this
captain
macqueen
said
to
storm
because
you
are
an
old
friend
of
kennedy
and
will
perhaps
know
the
best
manner
in
which
to
approach
him
this
matter
of
the
secret
radio
is
one
of
great
importance
and
we
can
not
forget
that
he
alone
holds
the
secret
of
its
extraordinary
you
overestimate
my
influence
was
storm
s
reply
wouldn
t
sally
do
quite
as
well
perhaps
the
captain
admitted
but
in
battles
of
major
importance
i
bring
up
all
my
forces
what
i
want
to
propose
is
that
sally
you
and
i
take
a
plane
to
ship
is
to
be
tied
up
long
enough
for
we
pick
up
a
rather
important
government
man
there
and
that
we
then
go
on
to
sally
s
home
town
to
interview
kennedy
what
do
you
think
of
that
sally
sounds
all
right
to
me
said
sally
i
agree
with
you
that
major
storm
will
be
a
great
how
about
it
storm
said
the
captain
can
you
arrange
for
the
time
off
oh
beyond
a
doubt
it
can
be
arranged
said
storm
then
we
are
all
captain
macqueen
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
the
rest
of
that
evening
was
given
over
to
telling
of
the
aircraft
carrier
s
journey
and
the
important
part
the
secret
radio
had
played
in
the
winning
of
her
battles
when
he
had
heard
the
story
silent
storm
was
more
than
eager
to
accompany
them
on
their
journey
to
the
home
of
the
great
inventor
one
thing
must
be
understood
from
the
start
he
said
as
the
skipper
and
sally
prepared
to
leave
that
is
that
i
am
a
real
friend
of
old
and
of
sally
as
well
if
there
are
negotiations
going
on
for
old
s
secret
i
shall
act
in
a
way
as
his
and
you
will
see
that
he
is
treated
fairly
said
the
captain
not
only
that
but
i
shall
see
that
he
knows
that
he
is
being
treated
fairly
storm
amended
that
s
just
what
i
had
hoped
for
the
captain
agreed
the
very
next
day
with
danny
as
for
a
big
plane
they
set
off
on
their
journey
hours
later
they
were
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
modest
shop
where
the
secret
radio
had
first
seen
the
light
of
day
sally
the
aged
inventor
exclaimed
at
sight
of
her
i
m
glad
to
see
you
but
how
is
it
that
you
are
back
so
soon
these
men
can
tell
you
more
about
that
than
i
sally
was
beaming
you
know
major
oh
yes
indeed
the
two
men
shook
hands
the
other
men
were
introduced
and
then
seated
on
rustic
benches
and
chairs
they
told
the
delighted
old
man
the
story
of
his
secret
radio
sally
you
have
done
all
that
i
hoped
and
much
more
he
exclaimed
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
i
shall
never
that
s
just
fine
said
sally
rising
a
bit
unsteadily
to
her
feet
m
glad
you
are
happy
and
now
i
am
going
to
leave
you
men
to
finish
the
business
of
the
hour
i
promised
to
show
danny
our
danny
the
old
man
laughed
happily
so
you
ve
got
you
a
danny
well
then
run
along
i
wouldn
t
keep
you
for
the
after
a
long
delightful
tramp
over
the
river
trail
sally
and
danny
came
to
rest
on
a
rustic
bench
overlooking
the
river
it
s
really
slow
and
peaceful
sally
murmured
i
ll
say
it
is
after
what
we
ve
gone
through
danny
agreed
my
hands
fairly
ache
for
the
controls
of
my
hands
said
sally
with
a
sly
smile
are
sometimes
used
for
other
that
s
right
they
are
danny
exclaimed
seizing
sally
s
hand
sally
didn
t
mind
so
they
sat
there
for
a
time
in
silence
then
came
the
sound
of
voices
they
are
looking
for
us
said
sally
time
for
a
crash
she
pulled
her
hand
away
so
here
you
are
captain
macqueen
said
a
moment
later
well
folks
said
silent
storm
everything
is
arranged
the
government
gets
the
secret
radio
and
your
gets
a
liberal
and
you
sally
are
to
receive
half
of
it
said
the
captain
what
sally
sprang
to
her
feet
why
that
s
unfair
he
didn
t
see
it
that
way
storm
replied
quietly
he
felt
that
you
have
done
more
than
he
to
make
the
radio
a
success
i
advise
that
you
accept
his
offer
and
allow
things
to
stand
as
they
are
it
is
for
the
good
of
your
country
as
well
as
yourself
and
there
will
be
plenty
for
you
both
i
assure
sally
settled
back
in
her
place
well
she
admitted
it
will
be
a
good
opportunity
to
help
my
country
in
another
way
i
ll
invest
it
in
war
bonds
right
away
will
really
be
aiding
our
nation
in
that
way
then
yes
said
the
captain
that
is
true
kennedy
wants
you
to
have
the
bungalow
you
have
always
dreamed
of
when
peace
has
come
won
t
that
be
sweet
sally
said
turning
to
danny
with
a
teasing
smile
danny
said
never
a
word
and
wants
you
to
come
back
to
