note
i
feel
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
book
is
part
of
the
caledonian
series
the
caledonian
series
is
a
group
of
books
comprising
all
of
sir
walter

works

or
is
sixty
years
since
by

volume
i
publishers
note
it
has
long
been
the
ambition
of
the
present
publishers
to
offer
to
the
public
an
ideal
edition
of
the
writings
of
sir
walter
scott
the
great
poet
and
novelist
of
whom
william
hazlitt
said
works
are
almost
like
a
new
edition
of
human
nature
secure
in
the
belief
not
only
that
his
writings
have
achieved
a
permanent
place
in
the
literature
of
the
world
but
that
succeeding
generations
will
prize
them
still
more
highly
we
have
after
the
most
careful
planning
and
study
undertaken
the
publication
of
this
edition
of
the
waverley
novels
and
the
complete
poetical
writings
it
is
evident
that
the
ideal
edition
of
a
great
classic
must
be
distinguished
in
typography
must
present
the
best
available
text
and
must
be
illustrated
in
such
a
way
as
at
once
to
be
beautiful
in
itself
and
to
add
to
the
reader
pleasure
and
his
understanding
of
the
book
as
to
the
typography
and
text
little
need
be
said
here
the
format
of
the
edition
has
been
most
carefully
studied
and
represents
the
use
of
the
best
resources
of
the
riverside
press
the
text
has
been
carefully
edited
in
the
light
of
scott
own
revisions
all
of
his
own
latest
notes
have
been
included
glossaries
have
been
added
and
full
descriptive
notes
to
the
illustrations
have
been
prepared
which
will
we
hope
add
greatly
to
the
reader
interest
and
instruction
in
the
reading
of
the
novels
and
poems
of
the
illustrations
which
make
the
special
feature
of
this
edition
something
more
may
be
said
in
the
case
of
an
author
like
sir
walter
scott
the
ideal
edition
requires
that
the
beautiful
and
romantic
scenery
amid
which
he
lived
and
of
which
he
wrote
shall
be
adequately
presented
to
the
reader
no
other
author
ever
used
more
charming
backgrounds
or
employed
them
to
better
advantage
to
see
scotland
and
to
visit
in
person
all
the
scenes
of
the
novels
and
poems
would
enable
the
reader
fully
to
understand
these
backgrounds
and
thereby
add
materially
to
his
appreciation
of
the
author
before
beginning
the
preparation
of
this
edition
the
head
of
the
department
having
it
in
charge
made
a
visit
in
person
to
the
scenes
of
the
novels
and
poems
determined
to
explore
all
the
localities
referred
to
by
the
author
so
far
as
they
could
be
identified
the
field
proved
even
more
productive
than
had
been
at
first
supposed
and
photographs
were
obtained
in
sufficient
quantity
to
illustrate
all
the
volumes
these
pictures
represent
the
scenes
very
much
as
scott
saw
them
the
natural
scenery
mountains
woods
lakes
rivers
seashore
and
the
like
is
nearly
the
same
as
in
his
day
the
ruins
of
ancient
castles
and
abbeys
were
found
to
correspond
very
closely
with
his
descriptions
though
in
many
instances
he
had
in
imagination
rebuilt
these
ruins
and
filled
them
with
the
children
of
his
fancy
the
scenes
of
the
stories
extend
into
nearly
every
county
in
scotland
and
through
a
large
part
of
england
and
wales
all
of
these
were
thoroughly
investigated
and
photographs
were
made
of
everything
of
interest
one
of
the
novels
has
to
do
with
france
and
belgium
one
with
switzerland
one
with
the
holy
land
one
with
constantinople
and
one
with
india
for
all
of
these
lands
which
scott
did
not
visit
in
person
and
therefore
did
not
describe
with
the
same
attention
to
detail
as
in
the
case
of
his
own
country
interesting
pictures
of
characteristic
scenery
were
secured
by
this
method
the
publishers
have
hoped
to
bring
before
the
reader
a
series
of
photographs
which
will
not
only
please
the
eye
and
give
a
satisfactory
artistic
effect
to
the
volumes
but
also
increase
the
reader
knowledge
of
the
country
described
and
add
a
new
charm
to
the
delightful
work
of
the
author
in
addition
to
the
photographs
old
engravings
and
paintings
have
been
reproduced
for
the
illustration
of
novels
having
to
do
with
old
buildings
streets
which
have
long
since
disappeared
for
this
material
a
careful
search
was
made
in
the
british
museum
the
library
and
city
museum
edinburgh
the
library
at
abbotsford
the
bibliotheque
nationale
paris
and
other
collections
it
has
been
thought
too
that
the
ideal
edition
of
scott
works
would
not
be
complete
without
an
adequate
portrayal
of
his
more
memorable
characters
this
has
been
accomplished
in
a
series
of
frontispieces
specially
painted
for
this
edition
by
twenty
of
the
most
distinguished
illustrators
of
england
park
street
boston
advertisement
to
the
waverley
novels
it
has
been
the
occasional
occupation
of
the
author
of
waverley
for
several
years
past
to
revise
and
correct
the
voluminous
series
of
novels
which
pass
under
that
name
in
order
that
if
they
should
ever
appear
as
his
avowed
productions
he
might
render
them
in
some
degree
deserving
of
a
continuance
of
the
public
favour
with
which
they
have
been
honoured
ever
since
their
first
appearance
for
a
long
period
however
it
seemed
likely
that
the
improved
and
illustrated
edition
which
he
meditated
would
be
a
posthumous
publication
but
the
course
of
the
events
which
occasioned
the
disclosure
of
the
author
name
having
in
a
great
measure
restored
to
him
a
sort
of
parental
control
over
these
works
he
is
naturally
induced
to
give
them
to
the
press
in
a
corrected
and
he
hopes
an
improved
form
while
life
and
health
permit
the
task
of
revising
and
illustrating
them
such
being
his
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
plan
of
the
proposed
edition
in
stating
it
to
be
revised
and
corrected
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
any
attempt
is
made
to
alter
the
tenor
of
the
stories
the
character
of
the
actors
or
the
spirit
of
the
dialogue
there
is
no
doubt
ample
room
for
emendation
in
all
these
points
but
where
the
tree
falls
it
must
lie
any
attempt
to
obviate
criticism
however
just
by
altering
a
work
already
in
the
hands
of
the
public
is
generally
unsuccessful
in
the
most
improbable
fiction
the
reader
still
desires
some
air
of
vraisemblance
and
does
not
relish
that
the
incidents
of
a
tale
familiar
to
him
should
be
altered
to
suit
the
taste
of
critics
or
the
caprice
of
the
author
himself
this
process
of
feeling
is
so
natural
that
it
may
be
observed
even
in
children
who
can
not
endure
that
a
nursery
story
should
be
repeated
to
them
differently
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
first
told
but
without
altering
in
the
slightest
degree
either
the
story
or
the
mode
of
telling
it
the
author
has
taken
this
opportunity
to
correct
errors
of
the
press
and
slips
of
the
pen
that
such
should
exist
can
not
be
wondered
at
when
it
is
considered
that
the
publishers
found
it
their
interest
to
hurry
through
the
press
a
succession
of
the
early
editions
of
the
various
novels
and
that
the
author
had
not
the
usual
opportunity
of
revision
it
is
hoped
that
the
present
edition
will
be
found
free
from
errors
of
that
accidental
kind
the
author
has
also
ventured
to
make
some
emendations
of
a
different
character
which
without
being
such
apparent
deviations
from
the
original
stories
as
to
disturb
the
reader
old
associations
will
he
thinks
add
something
to
the
spirit
of
the
dialogue
narrative
or
description
these
consist
in
occasional
pruning
where
the
language
is
redundant
compression
where
the
style
is
loose
infusion
of
vigour
where
it
is
languid
the
exchange
of
less
forcible
for
more
appropriate
epithets
slight
alterations
in
short
like
the
last
touches
of
an
artist
which
contribute
to
heighten
and
finish
the
picture
though
an
inexperienced
eye
can
hardly
detect
in
what
they
consist
the
general
preface
to
the
new
edition
and
the
introductory
notices
to
each
separate
work
will
contain
an
account
of
such
circumstances
attending
the
first
publication
of
the
novels
and
tales
as
may
appear
interesting
in
themselves
or
proper
to
be
communicated
to
the
public
the
author
also
proposes
to
publish
on
this
occasion
the
various
legends
family
traditions
or
obscure
historical
facts
which
have
formed
the
of
these
novels
and
to
give
some
account
of
the
places
where
the
scenes
are
laid
when
these
are
altogether
or
in
part
real
as
well
as
a
statement
of
particular
incidents
founded
on
fact
together
with
a
more
copious
glossary
and
notes
explanatory
of
the
ancient
customs
and
popular
superstitions
referred
to
in
the
romances
upon
the
whole
it
is
hoped
that
the
waverley
novels
in
their
new
dress
will
not
be
found
to
have
lost
any
part
of
their
attractions
in
consequence
of
receiving
illustrations
by
the
author
and
undergoing
his
careful
revision

iv
having
undertaken
to
give
an
introductory
account
of
the
compositions
which
are
here
offered
to
the
public
with
notes
and
illustrations
the
author
under
whose
name
they
are
now
for
the
first
time
collected
feels
that
he
has
the
delicate
task
of
speaking
more
of
himself
and
his
personal
concerns
than
may
perhaps
be
either
graceful
or
prudent
in
this
particular
he
runs
the
risk
of
presenting
himself
to
the
public
in
the
relation
that
the
dumb
wife
in
the
held
to
her
husband
when
having
spent
half
of
his
fortune
to
obtain
the
cure
of
her
imperfection
he
was
willing
to
have
bestowed
the
other
half
to
restore
her
to
her
former
condition
but
this
is
a
risk
inseparable
from
the
task
which
the
author
has
undertaken
and
he
can
only
promise
to
be
as
little
of
an
egotist
as
the
situation
will
permit
it
is
perhaps
an
indifferent
sign
of
a
disposition
to
keep
his
word
that
having
introduced
himself
in
the
third
person
singular
he
proceeds
in
the
second
paragraph
to
make
use
of
the
first
but
it
appears
to
him
that
the
seeming
modesty
connected
with
the
former
mode
of
writing
is
overbalanced
by
the
inconvenience
of
stiffness
and
affectation
which
attends
it
during
a
narrative
of
some
length
and
which
may
be
observed
less
or
more
in
every
work
in
which
the
third
person
is
used
from
the
commentaries
of
caesar
to
the
autobiography
of
alexander
the
corrector
i
must
refer
to
a
very
early
period
of
my
life
were
i
to
point
out
my
first
achievements
as
a
but
i
believe
some
of
my
old
schoolfellows
can
still
bear
witness
that
i
had
a
distinguished
character
for
that
talent
at
a
time
when
the
applause
of
my
companions
was
my
recompense
for
the
disgraces
and
punishments
which
the
future
incurred
for
being
idle
himself
and
keeping
others
idle
during
hours
that
should
have
been
employed
on
our
tasks
the
chief
enjoyment
of
my
holidays
was
to
escape
with
a
chosen
friend
who
had
the
same
taste
with
myself
and
alternately
to
recite
to
each
other
such
wild
adventures
as
we
were
able
to
devise
we
told
each
in
turn
interminable
tales
of
and
battles
and
enchantments
which
were
continued
from
one
day
to
another
as
opportunity
offered
without
our
ever
thinking
of
bringing
them
to
a
conclusion
as
we
observed
a
strict
secrecy
on
the
subject
of
this
intercourse
it
acquired
all
the
character
of
a
concealed
pleasure
and
we
used
to
select
for
the
scenes
of
our
indulgence
long
walks
through
the
solitary
and
romantic
environs
of
seat
salisbury
crags
braid
hills
and
similar
places
in
the
vicinity
of
edinburgh
and
the
recollection
of
those
holidays
still
forms
an
oasis
in
the
pilgrimage
which
i
have
to
look
back
upon
i
have
only
to
add
that
my
friend
still
lives
a
prosperous
gentleman
but
too
much
occupied
with
graver
business
to
thank
me
for
indicating
him
more
plainly
as
a
confidant
of
my
childish
mystery
when
boyhood
advancing
into
youth
required
more
serious
studies
and
graver
cares
a
long
illness
threw
me
back
on
the
kingdom
of
fiction
as
if
it
were
by
a
species
of
fatality
my
indisposition
arose
in
part
at
least
from
my
having
broken
a
and
motion
and
speech
were
for
a
long
time
pronounced
positively
dangerous
for
several
weeks
i
was
confined
strictly
to
my
bed
during
which
time
i
was
not
allowed
to
speak
above
a
whisper
to
eat
more
than
a
spoonful
or
two
of
boiled
rice
or
to
have
more
covering
than
one
thin
counterpane
when
the
reader
is
informed
that
i
was
at
this
time
a
growing
youth
with
the
spirits
appetite
and
impatience
of
fifteen
and
suffered
of
course
greatly
under
this
severe
regimen
which
the
repeated
return
of
my
disorder
rendered
indispensable
he
will
not
be
surprised
that
i
was
abandoned
to
my
own
discretion
so
far
as
reading
my
almost
sole
amusement
was
concerned
and
still
less
so
that
i
abused
the
indulgence
which
left
my
time
so
much
at
my
own
disposal
there
was
at
this
time
a
circulating
library
in
edinburgh
founded
i
believe
by
the
celebrated
allan
ramsay
which
besides
containing
a
most
respectable
collection
of
books
of
every
description
was
as
might
have
been
expected
peculiarly
rich
in
works
of
fiction
it
exhibited
specimens
of
every
kind
from
the
romances
of
chivalry
and
the
ponderous
folios
of
cyrus
and
cassandra
down
to
the
most
approved
works
of
later
times
i
was
plunged
into
this
great
ocean
of
reading
without
compass
or
pilot
and
unless
when
some
one
had
the
charity
to
play
at
chess
with
me
i
was
allowed
to
do
nothing
save
read
from
morning
to
night
i
was
in
kindness
and
pity
which
was
perhaps
erroneous
however
natural
permitted
to
select
my
subjects
of
study
at
my
own
pleasure
upon
the
same
principle
that
the
humours
of
children
are
indulged
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
as
my
taste
and
appetite
were
gratified
in
nothing
else
i
indemnified
myself
by
becoming
a
glutton
of
books
accordingly
i
believe
i
read
almost
all
the
romances
old
plays
and
epic
poetry
in
that
formidable
collection
and
no
doubt
was
unconsciously
amassing
materials
for
the
task
in
which
it
has
been
my
lot
to
be
so
much
employed
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
in
all
respects
abuse
the
license
permitted
me
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
specious
miracles
of
fiction
brought
with
it
some
degree
of
satiety
and
i
began
by
degrees
to
seek
in
histories
memoirs
voyages
and
travels
and
the
like
events
nearly
as
wonderful
as
those
which
were
the
work
of
imagination
with
the
additional
advantage
that
they
were
at
least
in
a
great
measure
true
the
lapse
of
nearly
two
years
during
which
i
was
left
to
the
exercise
of
my
own
free
will
was
followed
by
a
temporary
residence
in
the
country
where
i
was
again
very
lonely
but
for
the
amusement
which
i
derived
from
a
good
though
library
the
vague
and
wild
use
which
i
made
of
this
advantage
i
can
not
describe
better
than
by
referring
my
reader
to
the
desultory
studies
of
waverley
in
a
similar
situation
the
passages
concerning
whose
course
of
reading
were
imitated
from
recollections
of
my
own
it
must
be
understood
that
the
resemblance
extends
no
farther
time
as
it
glided
on
brought
the
blessings
of
confirmed
health
and
personal
strength
to
a
degree
which
had
never
been
expected
or
hoped
for
the
severe
studies
necessary
to
render
me
fit
for
my
profession
occupied
the
greater
part
of
my
time
and
the
society
of
my
friends
and
companions
who
were
about
to
enter
life
along
with
me
filled
up
the
interval
with
the
usual
amusements
of
young
men
i
was
in
a
situation
which
rendered
serious
labour
indispensable
for
neither
possessing
on
the
one
hand
any
of
those
peculiar
advantages
which
are
supposed
to
favour
a
hasty
advance
in
the
profession
of
the
law
nor
being
on
the
other
hand
exposed
to
unusual
obstacles
to
interrupt
my
progress
i
might
reasonably
expect
to
succeed
according
to
the
greater
or
less
degree
of
trouble
which
i
should
take
to
qualify
myself
as
a
pleader
it
makes
no
part
of
the
present
story
to
detail
how
the
success
of
a
few
ballads
had
the
effect
of
changing
all
the
purpose
and
tenor
of
my
life
and
of
converting
a
painstaking
lawyer
of
some
standing
into
a
follower
of
literature
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
had
assumed
the
latter
character
for
several
years
before
i
seriously
thought
of
attempting
a
work
of
imagination
in
prose
although
one
or
two
of
my
poetical
attempts
did
not
differ
from
romances
otherwise
than
by
being
written
in
verse
but
yet
i
may
observe
that
about
this
time
now
alas
thirty
years
since
i
had
nourished
the
ambitious
desire
of
composing
a
tale
of
chivalry
which
was
to
be
in
the
style
of
the
castle
of
otranto
with
plenty
of
border
characters
and
supernatural
incident
having
found
unexpectedly
a
chapter
of
this
intended
work
among
some
old
papers
i
have
subjoined
it
to
this
introductory
essay
thinking
some
readers
may
account
as
curious
the
first
attempts
at
romantic
composition
by
an
author
who
has
since
written
so
much
in
that
department
footnote
see
appendix
no
i
and
those
who
complain
not
unreasonably
of
the
profusion
of
the
tales
which
have
followed
waverley
may
bless
their
stars
at
the
narrow
escape
they
have
made
by
the
commencement
of
the
inundation
which
had
so
nearly
taken
place
in
the
first
year
of
the
century
being
postponed
for
fifteen
years
later
this
particular
subject
was
never
resumed
but
i
did
not
abandon
the
idea
of
fictitious
composition
in
prose
though
i
determined
to
give
another
turn
to
the
style
of
the
work
my
early
recollections
of
the
highland
scenery
and
customs
made
so
favourable
an
impression
in
the
poem
called
the
lady
of
the
lake
that
i
was
induced
to
think
of
attempting
something
of
the
same
kind
in
prose
i
had
been
a
good
deal
in
the
highlands
at
a
time
when
they
were
much
less
accessible
and
much
less
visited
than
they
have
been
of
late
years
and
was
acquainted
with
many
of
the
old
warriors
of
who
were
like
most
veterans
easily
induced
to
fight
their
battles
over
again
for
the
benefit
of
a
willing
listener
like
myself
it
naturally
occurred
to
me
that
the
ancient
traditions
and
high
spirit
of
a
people
who
living
in
a
civilised
age
and
country
retained
so
strong
a
tincture
of
manners
belonging
to
an
early
period
of
society
must
afford
a
subject
favourable
for
romance
if
it
should
not
prove
a
curious
tale
marred
in
the
telling
it
was
with
some
idea
of
this
kind
that
about
the
year
i
threw
together
about
part
of
the
first
volume
of
waverley
it
was
advertised
to
be
published
by
the
late
john
ballantyne
bookseller
in
edinburgh
under
the
name
of
waverley
or
is
fifty
years
since
a
title
afterwards
altered
to
is
sixty
years
since
that
the
actual
date
of
publication
might
be
made
to
correspond
with
the
period
in
which
the
scene
was
laid
having
proceeded
as
far
i
think
as
the
seventh
chapter
i
showed
my
work
to
a
critical
friend
whose
opinion
was
unfavourable
and
having
then
some
poetical
reputation
i
was
unwilling
to
risk
the
loss
of
it
by
attempting
a
new
style
of
composition
i
therefore
threw
aside
the
work
i
had
commenced
without
either
reluctance
or
remonstrance
i
ought
to
add
that
though
my
ingenious
sentence
was
afterwards
reversed
on
an
appeal
to
the
public
it
can
not
be
considered
as
any
imputation
on
his
good
taste
for
the
specimen
subjected
to
his
criticism
did
not
extend
beyond
the
departure
of
the
hero
for
scotland
and
consequently
had
not
entered
upon
the
part
of
the
story
which
was
finally
found
most
interesting
be
that
as
it
may
this
portion
of
the
manuscript
was
laid
aside
in
the
drawers
of
an
old
which
on
my
first
coming
to
reside
at
abbotsford
in
was
placed
in
a
lumber
garret
and
entirely
forgotten
thus
though
i
sometimes
among
other
literary
avocations
turned
my
thoughts
to
the
continuation
of
the
romance
which
i
had
commenced
yet
as
i
could
not
find
what
i
had
already
written
after
searching
such
repositories
as
were
within
my
reach
and
was
too
indolent
to
attempt
to
write
it
anew
from
memory
i
as
often
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
that
nature
two
circumstances
in
particular
recalled
my
recollection
of
the
mislaid
manuscript
the
first
was
the
extended
and
fame
of
miss
edgeworth
whose
irish
characters
have
gone
so
far
to
make
the
english
familiar
with
the
character
of
their
gay
and
neighbours
of
ireland
that
she
may
be
truly
said
to
have
done
more
towards
completing
the
union
than
perhaps
all
the
legislative
enactments
by
which
it
has
been
followed
up
without
being
so
presumptuous
as
to
hope
to
emulate
the
rich
humour
pathetic
tenderness
and
admirable
tact
which
pervade
the
works
of
my
accomplished
friend
i
felt
that
something
might
be
attempted
for
my
own
country
of
the
same
kind
with
that
which
miss
edgeworth
so
fortunately
achieved
for
ireland
something
which
might
introduce
her
natives
to
those
of
the
sister
kingdom
in
a
more
favourable
light
than
they
had
been
placed
hitherto
and
tend
to
procure
sympathy
for
their
virtues
and
indulgence
for
their
foibles
i
thought
also
that
much
of
what
i
wanted
in
talent
might
be
made
up
by
the
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
subject
which
i
could
lay
claim
to
possess
as
having
travelled
through
most
parts
of
scotland
both
highland
and
lowland
having
been
familiar
with
the
elder
as
well
as
more
modern
race
and
having
had
from
my
infancy
free
and
unrestrained
communication
with
all
ranks
of
my
countrymen
from
the
scottish
peer
to
the
scottish
such
ideas
often
occurred
to
me
and
constituted
an
ambitious
branch
of
my
theory
however
far
short
i
may
have
fallen
of
it
in
practice
but
it
was
not
only
the
triumphs
of
miss
edgeworth
which
worked
in
me
emulation
and
disturbed
my
indolence
i
chanced
actually
to
engage
in
a
work
which
formed
a
sort
of
essay
piece
and
gave
me
hope
that
i
might
in
time
become
free
of
the
craft
of
writing
and
be
esteemed
a
tolerable
workman
in
the
year
i
undertook
at
the
request
of
john
murray
of
albemarle
street
to
arrange
for
publication
some
posthumous
productions
of
the
late
joseph
strutt
distinguished
as
an
artist
and
an
antiquary
amongst
which
was
an
unfinished
romance
entitled
queenhoo
hall
the
scene
of
the
tale
was
laid
in
the
reign
of
henry
vi
and
the
work
was
written
to
illustrate
the
manners
customs
and
language
of
the
people
of
england
during
that
period
the
extensive
acquaintance
which
strutt
had
acquired
with
such
subjects
in
compiling
his
laborious
horda
his
regal
and
ecclesiastical
antiquities
and
his
essay
on
the
sports
and
pastimes
of
the
people
of
england
had
rendered
him
familiar
with
all
the
antiquarian
lore
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
composing
the
projected
romance
and
although
the
manuscript
bore
the
marks
of
hurry
and
incoherence
natural
to
the
first
rough
draught
of
the
author
it
evinced
in
my
opinion
considerable
powers
of
imagination
as
the
work
was
unfinished
i
deemed
it
my
duty
as
editor
to
supply
such
a
hasty
and
inartificial
conclusion
as
could
be
shaped
out
from
the
story
of
which
strutt
had
laid
the
foundation
this
concluding
chapter
footnote
see
appendix
no
ii
is
also
added
to
the
present
introduction
for
the
reason
already
mentioned
regarding
the
preceding
fragment
it
was
a
step
in
my
advance
towards
romantic
composition
and
to
preserve
the
traces
of
these
is
in
a
great
measure
the
object
of
this
essay
queenhoo
hall
was
not
however
very
successful
i
thought
i
was
aware
of
the
reason
and
supposed
that
by
rendering
his
language
too
ancient
and
displaying
his
antiquarian
knowledge
too
liberally
the
ingenious
author
had
raised
up
an
obstacle
to
his
own
success
every
work
designed
for
mere
amusement
must
be
expressed
in
language
easily
comprehended
and
when
as
is
sometimes
the
case
in
queenhoo
hall
the
author
addresses
himself
exclusively
to
the
antiquary
he
must
be
content
to
be
dismissed
by
the
general
reader
with
the
criticism
of
mungo
in
the
padlock
on
the
mauritanian
music
signifies
me
hear
if
me
no
understand
i
conceived
it
possible
to
avoid
this
error
and
by
rendering
a
similar
work
more
light
and
obvious
to
general
comprehension
to
escape
the
rock
on
which
my
predecessor
was
shipwrecked
but
i
was
on
the
other
hand
so
far
discouraged
by
the
indifferent
reception
of
strutt
romance
as
to
become
satisfied
that
the
manners
of
the
middle
ages
did
not
possess
the
interest
which
i
had
conceived
and
was
led
to
form
the
opinion
that
a
romance
founded
on
a
highland
story
and
more
modern
events
would
have
a
better
chance
of
popularity
than
a
tale
of
chivalry
my
thoughts
therefore
returned
more
than
once
to
the
tale
which
i
had
actually
commenced
and
accident
at
length
threw
the
lost
sheets
in
my
way
i
happened
to
want
some
for
the
use
of
a
guest
when
it
occurred
to
me
to
search
the
old
already
mentioned
in
which
i
used
to
keep
articles
of
that
nature
i
got
access
to
it
with
some
difficulty
and
in
looking
for
lines
and
flies
the
manuscript
presented
itself
i
immediately
set
to
work
to
complete
it
according
to
my
original
purpose
and
here
i
must
frankly
confess
that
the
mode
in
which
i
conducted
the
story
scarcely
deserved
the
success
which
the
romance
afterwards
attained
the
tale
of
waverley
was
put
together
with
so
little
care
that
i
can
not
boast
of
having
sketched
any
distinct
plan
of
the
work
the
whole
adventures
of
waverley
in
his
movements
up
and
down
the
country
with
the
highland
cateran
bean
lean
are
managed
without
much
skill
it
suited
best
however
the
road
i
wanted
to
travel
and
permitted
me
to
introduce
some
descriptions
of
scenery
and
manners
to
which
the
reality
gave
an
interest
which
the
powers
of
the
author
might
have
otherwise
failed
to
attain
for
them
and
though
i
have
been
in
other
instances
a
sinner
in
this
sort
i
do
not
recollect
any
of
these
novels
in
which
i
have
transgressed
so
widely
as
in
the
first
of
the
series
among
other
unfounded
reports
it
has
been
said
that
the
copyright
of
waverley
was
during
the
book
progress
through
the
press
offered
for
sale
to
various
in
london
at
a
very
inconsiderable
price
this
was
not
the
case
constable
and
cadell
who
published
the
work
were
the
only
persons
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
publication
and
they
offered
a
large
sum
for
it
while
in
the
course
of
printing
which
however
was
declined
the
author
not
choosing
to
part
with
the
copyright
the
origin
of
the
story
of
waverley
and
the
particular
facts
on
which
it
is
founded
are
given
in
the
separate
introduction
prefixed
to
that
romance
in
this
edition
and
require
no
notice
in
this
place
waverley
was
published
in
and
as
the
was
without
the
name
of
the
author
the
work
was
left
to
win
its
way
in
the
world
without
any
of
the
usual
recommendations
its
progress
was
for
some
time
slow
but
after
the
first
two
or
three
months
its
popularity
had
increased
in
a
degree
which
must
have
satisfied
the
expectations
of
the
author
had
these
been
far
more
sanguine
than
he
ever
entertained
great
anxiety
was
expressed
to
learn
the
name
of
the
author
but
on
this
no
authentic
information
could
be
attained
my
original
motive
for
publishing
the
work
anonymously
was
the
consciousness
that
it
was
an
experiment
on
the
public
taste
which
might
very
probably
fail
and
therefore
there
was
no
occasion
to
take
on
myself
the
personal
risk
of
discomfiture
for
this
purpose
considerable
precautions
were
used
to
preserve
secrecy
my
old
friend
and
schoolfellow
james
ballantyne
who
printed
these
novels
had
the
exclusive
task
of
corresponding
with
the
author
who
thus
had
not
only
the
advantage
of
his
professional
talents
but
also
of
his
critical
abilities
the
original
manuscript
or
as
it
is
technically
called
copy
was
transcribed
under
ballantyne
eye
by
confidential
persons
nor
was
there
an
instance
of
treachery
during
the
many
years
in
which
these
precautions
were
resorted
to
although
various
individuals
were
employed
at
different
times
double
were
regularly
printed
off
one
was
forwarded
to
the
author
by
ballantyne
and
the
alterations
which
it
received
were
by
his
own
hand
copied
upon
the
other
for
the
use
of
the
printers
so
that
even
the
corrected
proofs
of
the
author
were
never
seen
in
the
printing
office
and
thus
the
curiosity
of
such
eager
inquirers
as
made
the
most
minute
investigation
was
entirely
at
fault
but
although
the
cause
of
concealing
the
author
name
in
the
first
instance
when
the
reception
of
waverley
was
doubtful
was
natural
enough
it
is
more
difficult
it
may
be
thought
to
account
for
the
same
desire
for
secrecy
during
the
subsequent
editions
to
the
amount
of
betwixt
eleven
and
twelve
thousand
copies
which
followed
each
other
close
and
proved
the
success
of
the
work
i
am
sorry
i
can
give
little
satisfaction
to
queries
on
this
subject
i
have
already
stated
elsewhere
that
i
can
render
little
better
reason
for
choosing
to
remain
anonymous
than
by
saying
with
shylock
that
such
was
my
humour
it
will
be
observed
that
i
had
not
the
usual
stimulus
for
desiring
personal
reputation
the
desire
namely
to
float
amidst
the
conversation
of
men
of
literary
fame
whether
merited
or
undeserved
i
had
already
as
much
as
might
have
contented
a
mind
more
ambitious
than
mine
and
in
entering
into
this
new
contest
for
reputation
i
might
be
said
rather
to
endanger
what
i
had
than
to
have
any
considerable
chance
of
acquiring
more
i
was
affected
too
by
none
of
those
motives
which
at
an
earlier
period
of
life
would
doubtless
have
operated
upon
me
my
friendships
were
formed
my
place
in
society
fixed
my
life
had
attained
its
middle
course
my
condition
in
society
was
higher
perhaps
than
i
deserved
certainly
as
high
as
i
wished
and
there
was
scarce
any
degree
of
literary
success
which
could
have
greatly
altered
or
improved
my
personal
condition
i
was
not
therefore
touched
by
the
spur
of
ambition
usually
stimulating
on
such
occasions
and
yet
i
ought
to
stand
exculpated
from
the
charge
of
ungracious
or
unbecoming
indifference
to
public
applause
i
did
not
the
less
feel
gratitude
for
the
public
favour
although
i
did
not
proclaim
it
as
the
lover
who
wears
his
mistress
favour
in
his
bosom
is
as
proud
though
not
so
vain
of
possessing
it
as
another
who
displays
the
token
of
her
grace
upon
his
bonnet
far
from
such
an
ungracious
state
of
mind
i
have
seldom
felt
more
satisfaction
than
when
returning
from
a
pleasure
voyage
i
found
waverley
in
the
zenith
of
popularity
and
public
curiosity
in
full
cry
after
the
name
of
the
author
the
knowledge
that
i
had
the
public
approbation
was
like
having
the
property
of
a
hidden
treasure
not
less
gratifying
to
the
owner
than
if
all
the
world
knew
that
it
was
his
own
another
advantage
was
connected
with
the
secrecy
which
i
observed
i
could
appear
or
retreat
from
the
stage
at
pleasure
without
attracting
any
personal
notice
or
attention
other
than
what
might
be
founded
on
suspicion
only
in
my
own
person
also
as
a
successful
author
in
another
department
of
literature
i
might
have
been
charged
with
too
frequent
intrusions
on
the
public
patience
but
the
author
of
waverley
was
in
this
respect
as
impassible
to
the
critic
as
the
ghost
of
hamlet
to
the
partisan
of
marcellus
perhaps
the
curiosity
of
the
public
irritated
by
the
existence
of
a
secret
and
kept
afloat
by
the
discussions
which
took
place
on
the
subject
from
time
to
time
went
a
good
way
to
maintain
an
unabated
interest
in
these
frequent
publications
there
was
a
mystery
concerning
the
author
which
each
new
novel
was
expected
to
assist
in
unravelling
although
it
might
in
other
respects
rank
lower
than
its
predecessors
i
may
perhaps
be
thought
guilty
of
affectation
should
i
allege
as
one
reason
of
my
silence
a
secret
dislike
to
enter
on
personal
discussions
concerning
my
own
literary
labours
it
is
in
every
case
a
dangerous
intercourse
for
an
author
to
be
dwelling
continually
among
those
who
make
his
writings
a
frequent
and
familiar
subject
of
conversation
but
who
must
necessarily
be
partial
judges
of
works
composed
in
their
own
society
the
habits
of
which
are
thus
acquired
by
authors
are
highly
injurious
to
a
mind
for
the
cup
of
flattery
if
it
does
not
like
that
of
circe
reduce
men
to
the
level
of
beasts
is
sure
if
eagerly
drained
to
bring
the
best
and
the
ablest
down
to
that
of
fools
this
risk
was
in
some
degree
prevented
by
the
mask
which
i
wore
and
my
own
stores
of
were
left
to
their
natural
course
without
being
enhanced
by
the
partiality
of
friends
or
adulation
of
flatterers
if
i
am
asked
further
reasons
for
the
conduct
i
have
long
observed
i
can
only
resort
to
the
explanation
supplied
by
a
critic
as
friendly
as
he
is
intelligent
namely
that
the
mental
organisation
of
the
novelist
must
be
characterised
to
speak
craniologically
by
an
extraordinary
development
of
the
passion
for
delitescency
i
the
rather
suspect
some
natural
disposition
of
this
kind
for
from
the
instant
i
perceived
the
extreme
curiosity
manifested
on
the
subject
i
felt
a
secret
satisfaction
in
baffling
it
for
which
when
its
unimportance
is
considered
i
do
not
well
know
how
to
account
my
desire
to
remain
concealed
in
the
character
of
the
author
of
these
novels
subjected
me
occasionally
to
awkward
embarrassments
as
it
sometimes
happened
that
those
who
were
sufficiently
intimate
with
me
would
put
the
question
in
direct
terms
in
this
case
only
one
of
three
courses
could
be
followed
either
i
must
have
surrendered
my
secret
or
have
returned
an
equivocating
answer
or
finally
must
have
stoutly
and
boldly
denied
the
fact
the
first
was
a
sacrifice
which
i
conceive
no
one
had
a
right
to
force
from
me
since
i
alone
was
concerned
in
the
matter
the
alternative
of
rendering
a
doubtful
answer
must
have
left
me
open
to
the
degrading
suspicion
that
i
was
not
unwilling
to
assume
the
merit
if
there
was
any
which
i
dared
not
absolutely
lay
claim
to
or
those
who
might
think
more
justly
of
me
must
have
received
such
an
equivocal
answer
as
an
indirect
avowal
i
therefore
considered
myself
entitled
like
an
accused
person
put
upon
trial
to
refuse
giving
my
own
evidence
to
my
own
conviction
and
flatly
to
deny
all
that
could
not
be
proved
against
me
at
the
same
time
i
usually
qualified
my
denial
by
stating
that
had
i
been
the
author
of
these
works
i
would
have
felt
myself
quite
entitled
to
protect
my
secret
by
refusing
my
own
evidence
when
it
was
asked
for
to
accomplish
a
discovery
of
what
i
desired
to
conceal
the
real
truth
is
that
i
never
expected
or
hoped
to
disguise
my
connection
with
these
novels
from
any
one
who
lived
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
me
the
number
of
coincidences
which
necessarily
existed
between
narratives
recounted
modes
of
expression
and
opinions
broached
in
these
tales
and
such
as
were
used
by
their
author
in
the
intercourse
of
private
life
must
have
been
far
too
great
to
permit
any
of
my
familiar
acquaintances
to
doubt
the
identity
betwixt
their
friend
and
the
author
of
waverley
and
i
believe
they
were
all
morally
convinced
of
it
but
while
i
was
myself
silent
their
belief
could
not
weigh
much
more
with
the
world
than
that
of
others
their
opinions
and
reasoning
were
liable
to
be
taxed
with
partiality
or
confronted
with
opposing
arguments
and
opinions
and
the
question
was
not
so
much
whether
i
should
be
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
author
in
spite
of
my
own
denial
as
whether
even
my
own
avowal
of
the
works
if
such
should
be
made
would
be
sufficient
to
put
me
in
undisputed
possession
of
that
character
i
have
been
often
asked
concerning
supposed
cases
in
which
i
was
said
to
have
been
placed
on
the
verge
of
discovery
but
as
i
maintained
my
point
with
the
composure
of
a
lawyer
of
thirty
years
standing
i
never
recollect
being
in
pain
or
confusion
on
the
subject
in
captain
medwyn
conversations
of
lord
byron
the
reporter
states
himself
to
have
asked
my
noble
and
highly
gifted
friend
if
he
was
certain
about
these
novels
being
sir
walter
scott
to
which
lord
byron
replied
as
much
as
owned
himself
the
author
of
waverley
to
me
in
murray
shop
i
was
talking
to
him
about
that
novel
and
lamented
that
its
author
had
not
carried
back
the
story
nearer
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
scott
entirely
off
his
guard
replied
ay
i
might
have
done
so
but
there
he
stopped
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
correct
himself
he
looked
confused
and
relieved
his
embarrassment
by
a
precipitate
retreat
i
have
no
recollection
whatever
of
this
scene
taking
place
and
i
should
have
thought
that
i
was
more
likely
to
have
laughed
than
to
appear
confused
for
i
certainly
never
hoped
to
impose
upon
lord
byron
in
a
case
of
the
kind
and
from
the
manner
in
which
he
uniformly
expressed
himself
i
knew
his
opinion
was
entirely
formed
and
that
any
disclamations
of
mine
would
only
have
savoured
of
affectation
i
do
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
the
incident
did
not
happen
but
only
that
it
could
hardly
have
occurred
exactly
under
the
circumstances
narrated
without
my
recollecting
something
positive
on
the
subject
in
another
part
of
the
same
volume
lord
byron
is
reported
to
have
expressed
a
supposition
that
the
cause
of
my
not
avowing
myself
the
author
of
waverley
may
have
been
some
surmise
that
the
reigning
family
would
have
been
displeased
with
the
work
i
can
only
say
it
is
the
last
apprehension
i
should
have
entertained
as
indeed
the
inscription
to
these
volumes
sufficiently
proves
the
sufferers
of
that
melancholy
period
have
during
the
last
and
present
reign
been
honoured
both
with
the
sympathy
and
protection
of
the
reigning
family
whose
magnanimity
can
well
pardon
a
sigh
from
others
and
bestow
one
themselves
to
the
memory
of
brave
opponents
who
did
nothing
in
hate
but
all
in
honour
while
those
who
were
in
habitual
intercourse
with
the
real
author
had
little
hesitation
in
assigning
the
literary
property
to
him
others
and
those
critics
of
no
mean
rank
employed
themselves
in
investigating
with
persevering
patience
any
characteristic
features
which
might
seem
to
betray
the
origin
of
these
novels
amongst
these
one
gentleman
equally
remarkable
for
the
kind
and
liberal
tone
of
his
criticism
the
acuteness
of
his
reasoning
and
the
very
gentlemanlike
manner
in
which
he
conducted
his
inquiries
displayed
not
only
powers
of
accurate
investigation
but
a
temper
of
mind
deserving
to
be
employed
on
a
subject
of
much
greater
importance
and
i
have
no
doubt
made
converts
to
his
opinion
of
almost
all
who
thought
the
point
worthy
of
consideration
footnote
letters
on
the
author
of

rodwell
and
martin

of
those
letters
and
other
attempts
of
the
same
kind
the
author
could
not
complain
though
his
incognito
was
endangered
he
had
challenged
the
public
to
a
game
at
and
if
he
was
discovered
in

must
submit
to
the
shame

reports
were
of
course
circulated
in
various
ways
some
founded
on
an
inaccurate
rehearsal
of
what
may
have
been
partly
real
some
on
circumstances
having
no
concern
whatever
with
the
subject
and
others
on
the
invention
of
some
importunate
persons
who
might
perhaps
imagine
that
the
readiest
mode
of
forcing
the
author
to
disclose
himself
was
to
assign
some
dishonourable
and
discreditable
cause
for
his
silence
it
may
be
easily
supposed
that
this
sort
of
inquisition
was
treated
with
contempt
by
the
person
whom
it
principally
regarded
as
among
all
the
rumours
that
were
current
there
was
only
one
and
that
as
unfounded
as
the
others
which
had
nevertheless
some
alliance
to
probability
and
indeed
might
have
proved
in
some
degree
true
i
allude
to
a
report
which
ascribed
a
great
part
or
the
whole
of
these
novels
to
the
late
thomas
scott
of
the
regiment
then
stationed
in
canada
those
who
remember
that
gentleman
will
readily
grant
that
with
general
talents
at
least
equal
to
those
of
his
elder
brother
he
added
a
power
of
social
humour
and
a
deep
insight
into
human
character
which
rendered
him
an
universally
delightful
member
of
society
and
that
the
habit
of
composition
alone
was
wanting
to
render
him
equally
successful
as
a
writer
the
author
of
waverley
was
so
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
this
that
he
warmly
pressed
his
brother
to
make
such
an
experiment
and
willingly
undertook
all
the
trouble
of
correcting
and
superintending
the
press
thomas
scott
seemed
at
first
very
well
disposed
to
embrace
the
proposal
and
had
even
fixed
on
a
subject
and
a
hero
the
latter
was
a
person
well
known
to
both
of
us
in
our
boyish
years
from
having
displayed
some
strong
traits
of
character
scott
had
determined
to
represent
his
youthful
acquaintance
as
emigrating
to
america
and
encountering
the
dangers
and
hardships
of
the
new
world
with
the
same
dauntless
spirit
which
he
had
displayed
when
a
boy
in
his
native
country
scott
would
probably
have
been
highly
successful
being
familiarly
acquainted
with
the
manners
of
the
native
indians
of
the
old
french
settlers
in
canada
and
of
the
brules
or
woodsmen
and
having
the
power
of
observing
with
accuracy
what
i
have
no
doubt
he
could
have
sketched
with
force
and
expression
in
short
the
author
believes
his
brother
would
have
made
himself
distinguished
in
that
striking
field
in
which
since
that
period
cooper
has
achieved
so
many
triumphs
but
scott
was
already
affected
by
bad
health
which
wholly
unfitted
him
for
literary
labour
even
if
he
could
have
reconciled
his
patience
to
the
task
he
never
i
believe
wrote
a
single
line
of
the
projected
work
and
i
only
have
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
preserving
in
the
appendix
footnote
see
appendix
no
iii
the
simple
anecdote
on
which
he
proposed
to
found
it
to
this
i
may
add
i
can
easily
conceive
that
there
may
have
been
circumstances
which
gave
a
colour
to
the
general
report
of
my
brother
being
interested
in
these
works
and
in
particular
that
it
might
derive
strength
from
my
having
occasion
to
remit
to
him
in
consequence
of
certain
family
transactions
some
considerable
sums
of
money
about
that
period
to
which
it
is
to
be
added
that
if
any
person
chanced
to
evince
particular
curiosity
on
such
a
subject
my
brother
was
likely
enough
to
divert
himself
with
practising
on
their
credulity
it
may
be
mentioned
that
while
the
paternity
of
these
novels
was
from
time
to
time
warmly
disputed
in
britain
the
foreign
booksellers
expressed
no
hesitation
on
the
matter
but
affixed
my
name
to
the
whole
of
the
novels
and
to
some
besides
to
which
i
had
no
claim
the
volumes
therefore
to
which
the
present
pages
form
a
preface
are
entirely
the
composition
of
the
author
by
whom
they
are
now
acknowledged
with
the
exception
always
of
avowed
quotations
and
such
unpremeditated
and
involuntary
plagiarisms
as
can
scarce
be
guarded
against
by
any
one
who
has
read
and
written
a
great
deal

original
manuscripts
are
all

entirely
written

in
the
author
own
hand
excepting
during
the
years
and
when
being
affected
with
severe
illness
he
was
obliged
to
employ
the
assistance
of
a
friendly
amanuensis
the
number
of
persons
to
whom
the
secret
was
necessarily
entrusted
or
communicated
by
chance
amounted
i
should
think
to
twenty
at
least
to
whom
i
am
greatly
obliged
for
the
fidelity
with
which
they
observed
their
trust
until
the
derangement
of

affairs
of

and
the
exposure
of
their

which
was
the
necessary
consequence
rendered

introduction
to

preliminary
advertisement
has
given
a
sketch
of
the
purpose
of
this
edition
i
have
some
reason
to
fear
that
the
notes
which
accompany
the
tales
as
now
published
may
be
thought
too
miscellaneous
and
too
egotistical
it
maybe
some
apology
for
this
that
the
publication
was
intended
to
be
posthumous
and
still
more
that
old
men
may
be
permitted
to
speak
long
because
they
can
not
in
the
course
of
nature
have
long
time
to
speak
in
preparing
the
present
edition
i
have
done
all
that
i
can
do
to
explain
the
nature
of
my
materials
and
the
use
i
have
made
of
them
nor
is
it
probable
that
i
shall
again
revise
or
even
read
these
tales
i
was
therefore
desirous
rather
to
exceed
in
the
portion
of
new
and
explanatory
matter
which
is
added
to
this
edition
than
that
the
reader
should
have
reason
to
complain
that
the
information
communicated
was
of
a
general
and
merely
nominal
character
it
remains
to
be
tried
whether
the
public
like
a
child
to
whom
a
watch
is
shown
will
after
having
been
satiated
with
looking
at
the
outside
acquire
some
new
interest
in
the
object
when
it
is
opened
and
the
internal
machinery
displayed
to
them
that
waverly
and
its
successors
have
had
their
day
of
favour
and
popularity
must
be
admitted
with
sincere
gratitude
and
the
author
has
studied
with
the
prudence
of
a
beauty
whose
reign
has
been
rather
long
to
supply
by
the
assistance
of
art
the
charms
which
novelty
no
longer
affords
the
publishers
have
endeavoured
to
gratify
the
honourable
partiality
of
the
public
for
the
encouragement
of
british
art
by
illustrating
this
edition
with
designs
by
the
most
eminent
living

introduction
the
plan
of
this
edition
leads
me
to
insert
in
this
place
some
account
of
the
incidents
on
which
the
novel
of
waverley
is
founded
they
have
been
already
given
to
the
public
by
my

lamented
friend

quarterly
review

particulars

derived
by

critic

afterwards
they
were
published
in
the
preface

are
now
inserted

their
proper
place
the
mutual
protection
afforded
by
waverley
and
talbot
to
each
other
upon
which
the
whole
plot
depends
is
founded
upon
one
of
those
anecdotes
which
soften
the
features
even
of
civil
war
and
as
it
is
equally
honourable
to
the
memory
of
both
parties
we
have
no
hesitation
to
give
their
names
at
length
when
the
highlanders
on
the
morning
of
the
battle
of
preston
made
their
memorable
attack
on

alexander
stewart
of
invernahylewas
one
of
the
foremost
in
the
charge
and
observing
an
officer
of
the
forces
who
scorning
to
join
the
flight
of
all
around
remained
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
as
if
determined
to
the
very
last
to
defend
the
post
assigned
to
him
the
highland
gentleman
commanded
him
to
surrender
and
received
for
reply
a
thrust
which
he
caught
in
his
target
the
officer
was
now
defenceless
and
the
of
a
gigantic
highlander
the
miller
of
invernahyle
mill
was
uplifted
to
dash
his
brains
out
when
stewart
with
difficulty
prevailed
on
him
to
yield
he
took
charge
of
his
enemy
property
protected
his
person
and
finally
obtained
him
liberty
on
his
parole
the
officer
proved
to
be
colonel
whitefoord
an
ayrshire
gentleman
of
high
character
and
influence
and
warmly
attached
to
the
house
of
hanover
yet
such
was
the
confidence
existing
between
these
two
honourable
men
though
of
different
political
principles
that
while
the
civil
war
was
raging
and
straggling
officers
from
the
highland
army
were
executed
without
mercy
invernahyle
hesitated
not
to
pay
his
late
captive
a
visit
as
he
returned
to
the
highlands
to
raise
fresh
recruits
on
which
occasion
he
spent
a
day
or
two
in
ayrshire
among
colonel
whitefoord
whig
friends
as
pleasantly
and
as
as
if
all
had
been
at
peace
around
him
after
the
battle
of
culloden
had
ruined
the
hopes
of
charles
edward
and
dispersed
his
proscribed
adherents
it
was
colonel
whitefoord
turn
to
strain
every
nerve
to
obtain
pardon
he
went
to
the
lord
justice
clerk
to
the
lord
advocate
and
to
all
the
officers
of
state
and
each
application
was
answered
by
the
production
of
a
list
in
which
invernahyle
as
the
good
old
gentleman
was
wont
to
express
it
appeared
with
the
sign
of
the
beast
as
a
subject
unfit
for
favour
or
pardon
at
length
colonel
whitefoord
applied
to
the
duke
of
cumberland
in
person
from
him
also
he
received
a
positive
refusal
he
then
limited
his
request
for
the
present
to
a
protection
for
stewart
house
wife
children
and
property
this
was
also
refused
by
the
duke
on
which
colonel
whitefoord
taking
his
commission
from
his
bosom
laid
it
on
the
table
before
his
royal
highness
with
much
emotion
and
asked
permission
to
retire
from
the
service
of
a
sovereign
who
did
not
know
how
to
spare
a
vanquished
enemy
the
duke
was
struck
and
even
affected
he
bade
the
colonel
take
up
his
commission
and
granted
the
protection
he
required
it
was
issued
just
in
time
to
save
the
house
corn
and
cattle
at
invernahyle
from
the
troops
who
were
engaged
in
laying
waste
what
it
was
the
fashion
to
call
country
of
the
enemy
a
small
encampment
of
soldiers
was
formed
on
property
which
they
spared
while
plundering
the
country
around
and
searching
in
every
direction
for
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
and
for
stewart
in
particular
he
was
much
nearer
them
than
they
suspected
for
hidden
in
a
cave
like
the
baron
of
bradwardine
he
lay
for
many
days
so
near
the
english
sentinels
that
he
could
hear
their
called
his
food
was
brought
to
him
by
one
of
his
daughters
a
child
of
eight
years
old
whom
stewart
was
under
the
necessity
of
entrusting
with
this
commission
for
her
own
motions
and
those
of
all
her
elder
inmates
were
closely
watched
with
ingenuity
beyond
her
years
the
child
used
to
stray
about
among
the
soldiers
who
were
rather
kind
to
her
and
thus
seize
the
moment
when
she
was
unobserved
and
steal
into
the
thicket
when
she
deposited
whatever
small
store
of
provisions
she
had
in
charge
at
some
marked
spot
where
her
father
might
find
it
invernahyle
supported
life
for
several
weeks
by
means
of
these
precarious
supplies
and
as
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
of
culloden
the
hardships
which
he
endured
were
aggravated
by
great
bodily
pain
after
the
soldiers
had
removed
their
quarters
he
had
another
remarkable
escape
as
he
now
ventured
to
his
own
house
at
night
and
left
it
in
the
morning
he
was
espied
during
the
dawn
by
a
party
of
the
enemy
who
fired
at
and
pursued
him
the
fugitive
being
fortunate
enough
to
escape
their
search
they
returned
to
the
house
and
charged
the
family
with
harbouring
one
of
the
proscribed
traitors
an
old
woman
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
maintain
that
the
man
they
had
seen
was
the
shepherd
did
he
not
stop
when
we
called
to
him
said
the
soldier
is
as
deaf
poor
man
as
a
stack
answered
the
domestic
him
be
sent
for
directly
the
real
shepherd
accordingly
was
brought
from
the
hill
and
as
there
was
time
to
tutor
him
by
the
way
he
was
as
deaf
when
he
made
his
appearance
as
was
necessary
to
sustain
his
character
invernahyle
was
afterwards
pardoned
under
the
act
of
indemnity
the
author
knew
him
well
and
has
often
heard
these
circumstances
from
his
own
mouth
he
was
a
noble
specimen
of
the
old
highlander
far
descended
gallant
courteous
and
brave
even
to
chivalry
he
had
been
out
i
believe
in
and
was
an
active
partaker
in
all
the
stirring
scenes
which
passed
in
the
highlands
betwixt
these
memorable
eras
and
i
have
heard
was
remarkable
among
other
exploits
for
having
fought
a
duel
with
the
broadsword
with
the
celebrated
rob
roy
macgregor
at
the
clachan
of
balquidder
invernahyle
chanced
to
be
in
edinburgh
when
paul
jones
came
into
the
firth
of
forth
and
though
then
an
old
man
i
saw
him
in
arms
and
heard
him
exult
to
use
his
own
words
in
the
prospect
of
drawing
his
claymore
once
more
before
he
died
in
fact
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
the
capital
of
scotland
was
menaced
by
three
trifling
sloops
or
brigs
scarce
fit
to
have
sacked
a
fishing
village
he
was
the
only
man
who
seemed
to
propose
a
plan
of
resistance
he
offered
to
the
magistrates
if
broadswords
and
dirks
could
be
obtained
to
find
as
many
highlanders
among
the
lower
classes
as
would
cut
off
any
boat
crew
who
might
be
sent
into
a
town
full
of
narrow
and
winding
passages
in
which
they
were
like
to
disperse
in
quest
of
plunder
i
know
not
if
his
plan
was
attended
to
i
rather
think
it
seemed
too
hazardous
to
the
constituted
authorities
who
might
not
even
at
that
time
desire
to
see
arms
in
highland
hands
a
steady
and
powerful
west
wind
settled
the
matter
by
sweeping
paul
jones
and
his
vessels
out
of
the
firth
if
there
is
something
degrading
in
this
recollection
it
is
not
unpleasant
to
compare
it
with
those
of
the
last
war
when
edinburgh
besides
regular
forces
and
militia
furnished
a
volunteer
brigade
of
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
to
the
amount
of
six
thousand
men
and
upwards
which
was
in
readiness
to
meet
and
repel
a
force
of
a
far
more
formidable
description
than
was
commanded
by
the
adventurous
american
time
and
circumstances
change
the
character
of
nations
and
the
fate
of
cities
and
it
is
some
pride
to
a
scotchman
to
reflect
that
the
independent
and
manly
character
of
a
country
willing
to
entrust
its
own
protection
to
the
arms
of
its
children
after
having
been
obscured
for
half
a
century
has
during
the
course
of
his
own
lifetime
recovered
its
lustre
other
illustrations
of
waverley
will

several
volumes
preface
to
the
third
edition
to
this
slight
attempt
at
a
sketch
of
ancient
scottish
manners
the
public
have
been
more
favourable
than
the
author
durst
have
hoped
or
expected
he
has
heard
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
humility
his
work
ascribed
to
more
than
one
respectable
name
considerations
which
seem
weighty
in
his
particular
situation
prevent
his
releasing
those
gentlemen
from
suspicion
by
placing
his
own
name
in
the
so
that
for
the
present
at
least
it
must
remain
uncertain
whether
waverley
be
the
work
of
a
poet
or
a
critic
a
lawyer
or
a
clergyman
or
whether
the
writer
to
use
malaprop
phrase
be
cerberus
three
gentlemen
at
once
the
author
as
he
is
unconscious
of
anything
in
the
work
itself
except
perhaps
its
frivolity
which
prevents
its
finding
an
acknowledged
father
leaves
it
to
the
candour
of
the
public
to
choose
among
the
many
circumstances
peculiar
to
different
situations
in
life
such
as
may
induce
him
to
suppress
his
name
on
the
present
occasion
he
may
be
a
writer
new
to
publication
and
unwilling
to
avow
a
character
to
which
he
is
unaccustomed
or
he
may
be
a
hackneyed
author
who
is
ashamed
of
too
frequent
appearance
and
employs
this
mystery
as
the
heroine
of
the
old
comedy
used
her
mask
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
to
whom
her
face
had
become
too
familiar
he
may
be
a
man
of
a
grave
profession
to
whom
the
reputation
of
being
a
might
be
prejudicial
or
he
may
be
a
man
of
fashion
to
whom
writing
of
any
kind
might
appear
pedantic
he
may
be
too
young
to
assume
the
character
of
an
author
or
so
old
as
to
make
it
advisable
to
lay
it
aside
the
author
of
waverley
has
heard
it
objected
to
this
novel
that
in
the
character
of
callum
beg
and
in
the
account
given
by
the
baron
of
bradwardine
of
the
petty
trespasses
of
the
highlanders
upon
trifling
articles
of
property
he
has
borne
hard
and
unjustly
so
upon
their
national
character
nothing
could
be
farther
from
his
wish
or
intention
the
character
of
callum
beg
is
that
of
a
spirit
naturally
turned
to
daring
evil
and
determined
by
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
to
a
particular
species
of
mischief
those
who
have
perused
the
curious
letters
from
the
highlands
published
about
will
find
instances
of
such
atrocious
characters
which
fell
under
the
writer
own
observation
though
it
would
be
most
unjust
to
consider
such
villains
as
representatives
of
the
highlanders
of
that
period
any
more
than
the
murderers
of
marr
and
williamson
can
be
supposed
to
represent
the
english
of
the
present
day
as
for
the
plunder
supposed
to
have
been
picked
up
by
some
of
the
insurgents
in
it
must
be
remembered
that
although
the
way
of
that
unfortunate
little
army
was
neither
marked
by
devastation
nor
bloodshed
but
on
the
contrary
was
orderly
and
quiet
in
a
most
wonderful
degree
yet
no
army
marches
through
a
country
in
a
hostile
manner
without
committing
some
depredations
and
several
to
the
extent
and
of
the
nature
jocularly
imputed
to
them
by
the
baron
were
really
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
highland
insurgents
for
which
many
traditions
and
particularly
one
respecting
the
knight
of
the
mirror
may
be
quoted
as
good
evidence
footnote
a
homely
metrical
narrative
of
the
events
of
the
period
which
contains
some
striking
particulars
and
is
still
a
great
favourite
with
the
lower
classes
gives
a
very
correct
statement
of
the
behaviour
of
the
mountaineers
respecting
this
same
military
license

waverley
or

sixty
years
since
chapter
i
introductory
the
title
of
this
work
has
not
been
chosen
without
the
grave
and
solid
deliberation
which
matters
of
importance
demand
from
the
prudent
even
its
first
or
general
denomination
was
the
result
of
no
common
research
or
selection
although
according
to
the
example
of
my
predecessors
i
had
only
to
seize
upon
the
most
sounding
and
euphonic
surname
that
english
history
or
topography
affords
and
elect
it
at
once
as
the
title
of
my
work
and
the
name
of
my
hero
but
alas
what
could
my
readers
have
expected
from
the
chivalrous
epithets
of
howard
mordaunt
mortimer
or
stanley
or
from
the
softer
and
more
sentimental
sounds
of
belmour
belville
belfield
and
belgrave
but
pages
of
inanity
similar
to
those
which
have
been
so
christened
for
half
a
century
past
i
must
modestly
admit
i
am
too
diffident
of
my
own
merit
to
place
it
in
unnecessary
opposition
to
preconceived
associations
i
have
therefore
like
a
maiden
knight
with
his
white
shield
assumed
for
my
hero
waverley
an
uncontaminated
name
bearing
with
its
sound
little
of
good
or
evil
excepting
what
the
reader
shall
hereafter
be
pleased
to
affix
to
it
but
my
second
or
supplemental
title
was
a
matter
of
much
more
difficult
election
since
that
short
as
it
is
may
be
held
as
pledging
the
author
to
some
special
mode
of
laying
his
scene
drawing
his
characters
and
managing
his
adventures
had
i
for
example
announced
in
my
frontispiece
a
tale
of
other
days
must
not
every
have
anticipated
a
castle
scarce
less
than
that
of
udolpho
of
which
the
eastern
wing
had
long
been
uninhabited
and
the
keys
either
lost
or
consigned
to
the
care
of
some
aged
butler
or
housekeeper
whose
trembling
steps
about
the
middle
of
the
second
volume

introduce

or
if
i
had

call

of

the

solitary
hours

always
the

from

jump
out

is
more
than

bewildered
on

a

peasant
girl

hardly
can

again
if

waverley
had
been
entitled
tale
of

times
wouldst
thou
not
gentle
reader
have
demanded
from
me
a
dashing
sketch
of
the
fashionable
world
a
few
anecdotes
of
private
scandal
thinly
veiled
and
if
lusciously
painted
so
much
the
better
a
heroine
from
grosvenor
square
and
a
hero
from
the
barouche
club
or
the
with
a
set
of
subordinate
characters
from
the
elegantes
of
queen
anne
street
east
or
the
dashing
heroes
of
the
office
i
could
proceed
in
proving
the
importance
of
a
and
displaying
at
the
same
time
my
own
intimate
knowledge
of
the
particular
ingredients
necessary
to
the
composition
of
romances
and
novels
of
various
descriptions
but
it
is
enough
and
i
scorn
to
tyrannise
longer
over
the
impatience
of
my
reader
who
is
doubtless
already
anxious
to
know
the
choice
made
by
an
author
so
profoundly
versed
in
the
different
branches
of
his
art
by
fixing
then
the
date
of
my
story
sixty
years
before
this
present
november
i
would
have
my
readers
understand
that
they
will
meet
in
the
following
pages
neither
a
romance
of
chivalry
nor
a
tale
of
modern
manners
that
my
hero
will
neither
have
iron
on
his
shoulders
as
of
yore
nor
on
the
heels
of
his
boots
as
is
the
present
fashion
of
bond
street
and
that
my
damsels
will
neither
be
clothed
purple
and
in
pall
like
the
lady
alice
of
an
old
ballad
nor
reduced
to
the
primitive
nakedness
of
a
modern
fashionable
at
a
rout
from
this
my
choice
of
an
era
the
understanding
critic
may
farther
presage
that
the
object
of
my
tale
is
more
a
description
of
men
than
manners
a
tale
of
manners
to
be
interesting
must
either
refer
to
antiquity
so
great
as
to
have
become
venerable
or
it
must
bear
a
vivid
reflection
of
those
scenes
which
are
passing
daily
before
our
eyes
and
are
interesting
from
their
novelty
thus
the
mail
of
our
ancestors
and
the
pelisse
of
our
modern
beaux
may
though
for
very
different
reasons
be
equally
fit
for
the
array
of
a
fictitious
character
but
who
meaning
the
costume
of
his
hero
to
be
impressive
would
willingly
attire
him
in
the
court
dress
of
george
the
second
reign
with
its
no
collar
large
sleeves
and
low
the
same
may
be
urged
with
equal
truth
of
the
gothic
hall
which
with
its
darkened
and
tinted
windows
its
elevated
and
gloomy
roof
and
massive
oaken
table
garnished
with
and
rosemary
pheasants
and
peacocks
cranes
and
cygnets
has
an
excellent
effect
in
fictitious
description
much
may
also
be
gained
by
a
lively
display
of
a
modern
fete
such
as
we
have
daily
recorded
in
that
part
of
a
newspaper
entitled
the
mirror
of
fashion
if
we
contrast
these
or
either
of
them
with
the
splendid
formality
of
an
entertainment
given
sixty
years
since
and
thus
it
will
be
readily
seen
how
much
the
painter
of
antique
or
of
fashionable
manners
gains
over
him
who
delineates
those
of
the
last
generation
considering
the
disadvantages
inseparable
from
this
part
of
my
subject
i
must
be
understood
to
have
resolved
to
avoid
them
as
much
as
possible
by
throwing
the
force
of
my
narrative
upon
the
characters
and
passions
of
the
actors
those
passions
common
to
men
in
all
stages
of
society
and
which
have
alike
agitated
the
human
heart
whether
it
throbbed
under
the
steel
corslet
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
brocaded
coat
of
the
eighteenth
or
the
blue
frock
and
white
dimity
waistcoat
of
the
present
day
footnote
alas
that
attire
respectable
and
gentlemanlike
in
or
thereabouts
is
now
as
antiquated
as
the
author
of
waverley
has
himself
become
since
that
period
the
reader
of
fashion
will
please
to
fill
up
the
costume
with
an
embroidered
waistcoat
of
purple
velvet
or
silk
and
a
coat
of
whatever
colour
he
pleases
upon
these
passions
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
state
of
manners
and
laws
casts
a
necessary
colouring
but
the
bearings
to
use
the
language
of
heraldry
remain
the
same
though
the
tincture
may
be
not
only
different
but
opposed
in
strong
contradistinction
the
wrath
of
our
ancestors
for
example
was
coloured
gules
it
broke
forth
in
acts
of
open
and
sanguinary
violence
against
the
objects
of
its
fury
our
malignant
feelings
which
must
seek
gratification
through
more
indirect
channels
and
undermine
the
obstacles
which
they
can
not
openly
bear
down
may
be
rather
said
to
be
tinctured
sable
but
the
impulse
is
the
same
in
both
cases
and
the
proud
peer
who
can
now
only
ruin
his
neighbour
according
to
law
by
protracted
suits
is
the
genuine
descendant
of
the
baron
who
wrapped
the
castle
of
his
competitor
in
flames
and
knocked
him
on
the
head
as
he
endeavoured
to
escape
from
the
conflagration
it
is
from
the
great
book
of
nature
the
same
through
a
thousand
editions
whether
of
or
and
that
i
have
venturously
essayed
to
read
a
chapter
to
the
public
some
favourable
opportunities
of
contrast
have
been
afforded
me
by
the
state
of
society
in
the
northern
part
of
the
island
at
the
period
of
my
history
and
may
serve
at
once
to
vary
and
to
illustrate
the
moral
lessons
which
i
would
willingly
consider
as
the
most
important
part
of
my
plan
although
i
am
sensible
how
short
these
will
fall
of
their
aim
if
i
shall
be
found
unable
to
mix
them
with
amusement
a
task
not
quite
so
easy
in
this
critical
generation

it
was

a
retrospect
it
is
then
sixty
years
since
edward
waverley
the
hero
of
the
following
pages
took
leave
of
his
family
to
join
the
regiment
of
dragoons
in
which
he
had
lately
obtained
a
commission
it
was
a
melancholy
day
at
when
the
young
officer
parted
with
sir
everard
the
affectionate
old
uncle
to
whose
title
and
estate
he
was
presumptive
heir
a
difference
in
political
opinions
had
early
separated
the
baronet
from
his
younger
brother
richard
waverley
the
father
of
our
hero
sir
everard
had
inherited
from
his
sires
the
whole
train
of
tory
or
predilections
and
prejudices
which
had
distinguished
the
house
of
waverley
since
the
great
civil
war
richard
on
the
contrary
who
was
ten
years
younger
beheld
himself
born
to
the
fortune
of
a
second
brother
and
anticipated
neither
dignity
nor
entertainment
in
sustaining
the
character
of
will
wimble
he
saw
early
that
to
succeed
in
the
race
of
life
it
was
necessary
he
should
carry
as
little
weight
as
possible
painters
talk
of
the
difficulty
of
expressing
the
existence
of
compound
passions
in
the
same
features
at
the
same
moment
it
would
be
no
less
difficult
for
the
moralist
to
analyse
the
mixed
motives
which
unite
to
form
the
impulse
of
our
actions
richard
waverley
read
and
satisfied
himself
from
history
and
sound
argument
that
in
the
words
of
the
old
song
passive
obedience
was
a
jest
and
pshaw
was
yet
reason
would
have
probably
been
unable
to
combat
and
remove
hereditary
prejudice
could
richard
have
anticipated
that
his
elder
brother
sir
everard
taking
to
heart
an
early
disappointment
would
have
remained
a
bachelor
at
the
prospect
of
succession
however
remote
might
in
that
case
have
led
him
to
endure
dragging
through
the
greater
part
of
his
life
as
richard
at
the
hall
the
baronet
brother
in
the
hope
that
ere
its
conclusion
he
should
be
distinguished
as
sir
richard
waverley
of
successor
to
a
princely
estate
and
to
extended
political
connections
as
head
of
the
county
interest
in
the
shire
where
it
lay
but
this
was
a
consummation
of
things
not
to
be
expected
at
richard
outset
when
sir
everard
was
in
the
prime
of
life
and
certain
to
be
an
acceptable
suitor
in
almost
any
family
whether
wealth
or
beauty
should
be
the
object
of
his
pursuit
and
when
indeed
his
speedy
marriage
was
a
report
which
regularly
amused
the
neighbourhood
once
a
year
his
younger
brother
saw
no
practicable
road
to
independence
save
that
of
relying
upon
his
own
exertions
and
adopting
a
political
creed
more
consonant
both
to
reason
and
his
own
interest
than
the
hereditary
faith
of
sir
everard
in
and
in
the
house
of
stuart
he
therefore
read
his
recantation
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
and
entered
life
as
an
avowed
whig
and
friend
of
the
hanover
succession
the
ministry
of
george

first

prudently
anxious
to
diminish
the
phalanx

tory
nobility

their
reflected
lustre

sunshine

court

for
some
time
been

reconciling
themselves

new

rank
which
retained
with
much
of
ancient
manners
and
primitive
integrity
a
great
proportion
of
obstinate
and
unyielding
prejudice
stood
aloof
in
haughty
and
sullen
opposition
and
cast
many
a
look
of
mingled
regret
and
hope
to

the

shift

inflexible
opponents

therefore
richard

met
with
a

ministerial
favour
more
than
proportioned
to
his
talents

his
political
importance
it
was
however
discovered
that
he
had
respectable
talents
for
public
business
and
the
first
admittance
to

negotiated
his

sir

learned
from
the

that

taken

that

been
honoured
with
a

at
one
of

boards

the
pleasure

serving
the
country
is
combined
with

important
gratifications

render
them
the

regularly

followed
each

so
closely

the
sagacity

would
have
presaged

it
was
generally
worn
to

in
about
a

to

the
case
before

had
the
sum
total
of
his
enormities
reached
the
ears
of
sir
everard
at
once
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
new
commissioner
would
have
had
little
reason
to
pique
himself
on
the
success
of
his
politics
the
baronet
although
the
mildest
of
human
beings
was
not
without
sensitive
points
in
his
character
his
brother
conduct
had
wounded
these
deeply
the
waverley
estate
was
fettered
by
no
entail
for
it
had
never
entered
into
the
head
of
any
of
its
former
possessors
that
one
of
their
progeny
could
be
guilty
of
the
atrocities
laid
by
dyer
to
the
door
of
richard
and
if
it
had
the
marriage
of
the
proprietor
might
have
been
fatal
to
a
collateral
heir
these
various
ideas
floated
through
the
brain
of
sir
everard
without
however
producing
any
determined
conclusion
he
examined
the
tree
of
his
genealogy
which
emblazoned
with
many
an
emblematic
mark
of
honour
and
heroic
achievement
hung
upon
the
wainscot
of
his

the
nearest
descendants

hildebrand
waverley
failing
those
of
his
eldest
son
wilfred
of
whom
sir
everard
and
his
brother
were
the
only
representatives
were
as
this
honoured
register
informed
him
and
indeed
as
he
himself
well
knew
the
waverleys
of
highley
park
com
hants
with
whom
the
main
branch
or
rather
stock
of
the
house
had
renounced
all
connection
since
the
great
in
this
degenerate
scion
had
committed
a
farther
offence
against
the
head
and
source
of
their
gentility
by
the
intermarriage
of
their
representative
with
judith
heiress
of
oliver
bradshawe
of

whose
arms
the
same
with
those
of
bradshawe
the
regicide
they
had
quartered
with
the
ancient
coat
of
waverley
these
offences
however
had
vanished
from
sir
recollection
in
the
heat
of
his
resentment
and
had
lawyer
clippurse
for
whom
his
groom
was
despatched
express
arrived

an
hour
earlier
he
might
have
had
the
benefit
of
drawing
a
new
settlement
of
the
lordship
and
manor
of

all
its
dependencies
but
an
hour
of
cool
reflection
is
a
great
matter
when
employed
in
weighing
the
comparative
evil
of
two
measures
to
neither
of
which
we
are
internally
partial
lawyer
clippurse
found
his
patron
involved
in
a
deep
study
which
he
was
too
respectful
to
disturb
otherwise
than
by
producing
his
paper
and
leathern
as
prepared
to
minute
his
honour
commands
even
this
slight
manoeuvre
was
embarrassing
to
sir
everard
who
felt
it
as
a
reproach
to
his
indecision
he
looked
at
the
attorney
with
some
desire
to
issue
his
fiat
when
the
sun
emerging
from
behind
a
cloud
poured
at
once
its
chequered
light
through
the
stained
window
of
the
gloomy
cabinet
in
which
they
were
seated
the
baronet
eye
as
he
raised
it
to
the
splendour
fell
right
upon
the
central
scutcheon

his

was
said
to

exclaimed
sir
everard
that
ancient

loyal
symbol
should
be
blended
with
the
dishonoured
insignia

traitorous
roundhead
all
this
was
the
effect
of
the
glimpse
of
a
sunbeam
just
sufficient
to
light

clippurse
to
mend
his
pen
the
pen
was
mended
in

was
dismissed
with
directions
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
on
the
first
summons
the
apparition
of

of
this
microcosm
augured
yet
worse
consequences
to
richard
waverley
from
a
movement
which
shortly
followed
his
apostasy
this
was
no
less
than
an
excursion
of
the
baronet
in
his
with
four
attendants
in
rich
liveries
to
make
a
visit
of
some
duration
to
a
noble
peer
on
the
confines
of
the
shire
of
untainted
descent
steady
tory
principles
and
the
happy
father
of
six
unmarried
and
accomplished
daughters
sir
everard
reception
in
this
family
was
as
it
may
be
easily
conceived
sufficiently
favourable
but
of
the
six
young
ladies
his
taste
unfortunately
determined
him
in
favour
of
lady
emily
the
youngest
who
received
his
attentions
with
an
embarrassment
which
showed
at
once
that
she
durst
not
decline
them
and
that
they
afforded
her
anything
but
pleasure
sir
everard
could
not
but
perceive
something
uncommon
in
the
restrained
emotions
which
the
young
lady
testified
at
the
advances
he
hazarded
but
assured
by
the
prudent
countess
that
they
were
the
natural
effects
of
a
retired
education
the
sacrifice
might
have
been
completed
as
doubtless
has
happened
in
many
similar
instances
had
it
not
been
for
the
courage
of
an
elder
sister
who
revealed
to
the
wealthy
suitor
that
lady
emily
affections
were
fixed
upon
a
young
soldier
of
fortune
a
near
relation
of
her
own
sir
everard
manifested
great
emotion
on
receiving
this
intelligence
which
was
confirmed
to
him
in
a
private
interview
by
the
young
lady
herself
although
under
the
most
dreadful
apprehensions
of
her
father
indignation
honour
and
generosity
were
hereditary
attributes
of
the
house
of
waverley
with
a
grace
and
delicacy
worthy
the
hero
of
a
romance
sir
everard
withdrew
his
claim
to
the
hand
of
lady
emily
he
had
even
before
leaving
blandeville
castle
the
address
to
extort
from
her
father
a
consent
to
her
union
with
the
object
of
her
choice
what
arguments
he
used
on
this
point
can
not
exactly
be
known
for
sir
everard
was
never
supposed
strong
in
the
powers
of
persuasion
but
the
young
officer
immediately
after
this
transaction
rose
in
the
army
with
a
rapidity
far
surpassing
the
usual
pace
of
unpatronised
professional
merit
although
to
outward
appearance
that
was
all
he
had
to
depend
upon
the
shock
which
sir
everard
encountered
upon
this
occasion
although
diminished
by
the
consciousness
of
having
acted
virtuously
and
generously
had
its
effect
upon
his
future
life
his
resolution
of
marriage
had
been
adopted
in
a
fit
of
indignation
the
labour
of
courtship
did
not
quite
suit
the
dignified
indolence
of
his
habits
he
had
but
just
escaped
the
risk
of
marrying
a
woman
who
could
never
love
him
and
his
pride
could
not
be
greatly
flattered
by
the
termination
of
his
amour
even
if
his
heart
had
not
suffered
the
result
of
the
whole
matter
was
his
return
to
without
any
transfer
of
his
affections
notwithstanding
the
sighs
and
languishments
of
the
fair
who
had
revealed
in
mere
sisterly
affection
the
secret
of
lady
emily
attachment
and
in
despite
of
the
nods
winks
and
innuendos
of
the
officious
lady
mother
and
the
grave
eulogiums
which
the
earl
pronounced
successively
on
the
prudence
and
good
sense
and
admirable
dispositions
of
his
first
second
third
fourth
and
fifth
daughters
the
memory
of
his
unsuccessful
amour
was
with
sir
everard
as
with
many
more
of
his
temper
at
once
shy
proud
sensitive
and
indolent
a
beacon
against
exposing
himself
to
similar
mortification
pain
and
fruitless
exertion
for
the
time
to
come
he
continued
to
live
at
in
the
style
of
an
old
english
gentleman
of
an
ancient
descent
and
opulent
fortune
his
sister
miss
rachel
waverley
presided
at
his
table
and
they
became
by
degrees
an
old
bachelor
and
an
ancient
maiden
lady
the
gentlest
and
kindest
of
the
votaries
of
celibacy
the
vehemence
of
sir
everard
resentment
against
his
brother
was
but
yet
his
dislike
to
the
whig
and
the
placeman
though
unable
to
stimulate
him
to
resume
any
active
measures
prejudicial
to
richard
interest
in
the
succession
to
the
family
estate
continued
to
maintain
the
coldness
between
them
richard
knew
enough
of
the
world
and
of
his
brother
temper
to
believe
that
by
any
or
precipitate
advances
on
his
part
he
might
turn
passive
dislike
into
a
more
active
principle
it
was
accident
therefore
which
at
length
occasioned
a
renewal
of
their
intercourse
richard
had
married
a
young
woman
of
rank
by
whose
family
interest
and
private
fortune
he
hoped
to
advance
his
career
in
her
right
he
became
possessor
of
a
manor
of
some
value
at
the
distance
of
a
few
miles
from
little
edward
the
hero
of
our
tale
then
in
his
fifth
year
was
their
only
child
it
chanced
that
the
infant
with
his
maid
had
strayed
one
morning
to
a
mile
distance
from
the
avenue
of
brerewood
lodge
his
father
seat
their
attention
was
attracted
by
a
carriage
drawn
by
six
stately
black
horses
and
with
as
much
carving
and
gilding
as
would
have
done
honour
to
my
lord
mayor
it
was
waiting
for
the
owner
who
was
at
a
little
distance
inspecting
the
progress
of
a
i
know
not
whether
the
boy
nurse
had
been
a
welsh
or
a
woman
or
in
what
manner
he
associated
a
shield
emblazoned
with
three
ermines
with
the
idea
of
personal
property
but
he
no
sooner
beheld
this
family
emblem
than
he
stoutly
determined
on
vindicating
his
right
to
the
splendid
vehicle
on
which
it
was
displayed
the
baronet
arrived
while
the
boy
maid
was
in
vain
endeavouring
to
make
him
desist
from
his
determination
to
appropriate
the
gilded
the
rencontre
was
at
a
happy
moment
for
edward
as
his
uncle
had
been
just
eyeing
wistfully
with
something
of
a
feeling
like
envy
the
chubby
boys
of
the
stout
yeoman
whose
mansion
was
building
by
his
direction
in
the
rosy
cherub
before
him
bearing
his
eye
and
his
name
and
vindicating
a
hereditary
title
to
his
family
affection
and
patronage
by
means
of
a
tie
which
sir
everard
held
as
sacred
as
either
garter
or
providence
seemed
to
have
granted
to
him
the
very
object
best
calculated
to
fill
up
the
void
in
his
hopes
and
affections
sir
everard
returned
to
upon
a
led
horse
which
was
kept
in
readiness
for
him
while
the
child
and
his
attendant
were
sent
home
in
the
carriage
to
brerewood
lodge
with
such
a
message
as
opened
to
richard
waverley
a
door
of
reconciliation
with
his
elder
brother
their
intercourse
however
though
thus
renewed
continued
to
be
rather
formal
and
civil
than
partaking
of
brotherly
cordiality
yet
it
was
sufficient
to
the
wishes
of
both
parties
sir
everard
obtained
in
the
frequent
society
of
his
little
nephew
something
on
which
his
hereditary
pride
might
found
the
anticipated
pleasure
of
a
continuation
of
his
lineage
and
where
his
kind
and
gentle
affections
could
at
the
same
time
fully
exercise
themselves
for
richard
waverley
he
beheld
in
the
growing
attachment
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
the
means
of
securing
his
son
if
not
his
own
succession
to
the
hereditary
estate
which
he
felt
would
be
rather
endangered
than
promoted
by
any
attempt
on
his
own
part
towards
a
closer
intimacy
with
a
man
of
sir
everard
habits
and
opinions
thus
by
a
sort
of
tacit
compromise
little
edward
was
permitted
to
pass
the
greater
part
of
the
year
at
the
hall
and
appeared
to
stand
in
the
same
intimate
relation
to
both
families
although
their
mutual
intercourse
was
otherwise
limited
to
formal
messages
and
more
formal
visits
the
education
of
the
youth
was
regulated
alternately
by
the
taste
and
opinions
of
his
uncle
and
of
his
father
but
more
of
this
in
a
subsequent
chapter
chapter
iii
education
the
education
of
our
hero
edward
waverley
was
of
a
nature
somewhat
desultory
in
infancy
his
health
suffered
or
was
supposed
to
suffer
which
is
quite
the
same
thing
by
the
air
of
london
as
soon
therefore
as
official
duties
attendance
on
parliament
or
the
prosecution
of
any
of
his
plans
of
interest
or
ambition
called
his
father
to
town
which
was
his
usual
residence
for
eight
months
in
the
year
edward
was
transferred
to
honour
and
experienced
a
total
change
of
instructors
and
of
lessons
as
well
as
of
residence
this
might
have
been
remedied
had
his
father
placed
him
under
the
superintendence
of
a
permanent
tutor
but
he
considered
that
one
of
his
choosing
would
probably
have
been
unacceptable
at
and
that
such
a
selection
as
sir
everard
might
have
made
were
the
matter
left
to
him
would
have
burdened
him
with
a
disagreeable
inmate
if
not
a
political
spy
in
his
family
he
therefore
prevailed
upon
his
private
secretary
a
young
man
of
taste
and
accomplishments
to
bestow
an
hour
or
two
on
edward
education
while
at
brerewood
lodge
and
left
his
uncle
answerable
for
his
improvement
in
literature
while
an
inmate
at
the
hall
this
was
in
some
degree
respectably
provided
for
sir
everard
chaplain
an
oxonian
who
had
lost
his
fellowship
for
declining
to
take
the
oaths
at
the
accession
of
george
i
was
not
only
an
excellent
classical
scholar
but
reasonably
skilled
in
science
and
master
of
most
modern
languages
he
was
however
old
and
indulgent
and
the
recurring
interregnum
during
which
edward
was
entirely
freed
from
his
discipline
occasioned
such
a
relaxation
of
authority
that
the
youth
was
permitted
in
a
great
measure
to
learn
as
he
pleased
what
he
pleased
and
when
he
pleased
this
slackness
of
rule
might
have
been
ruinous
to
a
boy
of
slow
understanding
who
feeling
labour
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
would
have
altogether
neglected
it
save
for
the
command
of
a
taskmaster
and
it
might
have
proved
equally
dangerous
to
a
youth
whose
animal
spirits
were
more
powerful
than
his
imagination
or
his
feelings
and
whom
the
irresistible
influence
of
alma
would
have
engaged
in
from
morning
till
night
but
the
character
of
edward
waverley
was
remote
from
either
of
these
his
powers
of
apprehension
were
so
uncommonly
quick
as
almost
to
resemble
intuition
and
the
chief
care
of
his
preceptor
was
to
prevent
him
as
a
sportsman
would
phrase
it
from
his
game
that
is
from
acquiring
his
knowledge
in
a
slight
flimsy
and
inadequate
manner
and
here
the
instructor
had
to
combat
another
propensity
too
often
united
with
brilliancy
of
fancy
and
vivacity
of
talent
that
indolence
namely
of
disposition
which
can
only
be
stirred
by
some
strong
motive
of
gratification
and
which
renounces
study
as
soon
as
curiosity
is
gratified
the
pleasure
of
conquering
the
first
difficulties
exhausted
and
the
novelty
of
pursuit
at
an
end
edward
would
throw
himself
with
spirit
upon
any
classical
author
of
which
his
preceptor
proposed
the
perusal
make
himself
master
of
the
style
so
far
as
to
understand
the
story
and
if
that
pleased
or
interested
him
he
finished
the
volume
but
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
fixing
his
attention
on
critical
distinctions
of
philology
upon
the
difference
of
idiom
the
beauty
of
felicitous
expression
or
the
artificial
combinations
of
syntax
can
read
and
understand
a
latin
author
said
young
edward
with
the
and
rash
reasoning
of
fifteen
scaliger
or
bentley
could
not
do
much
more
alas
while
he
was
thus
permitted
to
read
only
for
the
gratification
of
his
amusement
he
foresaw
not
that
he
was
losing
for
ever
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
habits
of
firm
and
assiduous
application
of
gaining
the
art
of
controlling
directing
and
concentrating
the
powers
of
his
mind
for
earnest
investigation
an
art
far
more
essential
than
even
that
intimate
acquaintance
with
classical
learning
which
is
the
primary
object
of
study
i
am
aware
i
may
be
here
reminded
of
the
necessity
of
rendering
instruction
agreeable
to
youth
and
of
tasso
infusion
of
honey
into
the
medicine
prepared
for
a
child
but
an
age
in
which
children
are
taught
the
driest
doctrines
by
the
insinuating
method
of
instructive
games
has
little
reason
to
dread
the
consequences
of
study
being
rendered
too
serious
or
severe
the
history
of
england
is
now
reduced
to
a
game
at
cards
the
problems
of
mathematics
to
puzzles
and
riddles
and
the
doctrines
of
arithmetic
may
we
are
assured
be
sufficiently
acquired
by
spending
a
few
hours
a
week
at
a
new
and
complicated
edition
of
the
royal
game
of
the
goose
there
wants
but
one
step
further
and
the
creed
and
ten
commandments
may
be
taught
in
the
same
manner
without
the
necessity
of
the
grave
face
deliberate
tone
of
recital
and
devout
attention
hitherto
exacted
from
the
governed
childhood
of
this
realm
it
may
in
the
meantime
be
subject
of
serious
consideration
whether
those
who
are
accustomed
only
to
acquire
instruction
through
the
medium
of
amusement
may
not
be
brought
to
reject
that
which
approaches
under
the
aspect
of
study
whether
those
who
learn
history
by
the
cards
may
not
be
led
to
prefer
the
means
to
the
end
and
whether
were
we
to
teach
religion
in
the
way
of
sport
our
pupils
may
not
thereby
be
gradually
induced
to
make
sport
of
their
religion
to
our
young
hero
who
was
permitted
to
seek
his
instruction
only
according
to
the
bent
of
his
own
mind
and
who
of
consequence
only
sought
it
so
long
as
it
afforded
him
amusement
the
indulgence
of
his
tutors
was
attended
with
evil
consequences
which
long
continued
to
influence
his
character
happiness
and
utility
edward
power
of
imagination
and
love
of
literature
although
the
former
was
vivid
and
the
latter
ardent
were
so
far
from
affording
a
remedy
to
this
peculiar
evil
that
they
rather
inflamed
and
increased
its
violence
the
library
at
a
large
gothic
room
with
double
arches
and
a
gallery
contained
such
a
miscellaneous
and
extensive
collection
of
volumes
as
had
been
assembled
together
during
the
course
of
two
hundred
years
by
a
family
which
had
been
always
wealthy
and
inclined
of
course
as
a
mark
of
splendour
to
furnish
their
shelves
with
the
current
literature
of
the
day
without
much
scrutiny
or
nicety
of
discrimination
throughout
this
ample
realm
edward
was
permitted
to
roam
at
large
his
tutor
had
his
own
studies
and
church
politics
and
controversial
divinity
together
with
a
love
of
learned
ease
though
they
did
not
withdraw
his
attention
at
stated
times
from
the
progress
of
his
patron
presumptive
heir
induced
him
readily
to
grasp
at
any
apology
for
not
extending
a
strict
and
regulated
survey
towards
his
general
studies
sir
everard
had
never
been
himself
a
student
and
like
his
sister
miss
rachel
waverley
he
held
the
common
doctrine
that
idleness
is
incompatible
with
reading
of
any
kind
and
that
the
mere
tracing
the
alphabetical
characters
with
the
eye
is
in
itself
a
useful
and
meritorious
task
without
scrupulously
considering
what
ideas
or
doctrines
they
may
happen
to
convey
with
a
desire
of
amusement
therefore
which
better
discipline
might
soon
have
converted
into
a
thirst
for
knowledge
young
waverley
drove
through
the
sea
of
books
like
a
vessel
without
a
pilot
or
a
rudder
nothing
perhaps
increases
by
indulgence
more
than
a
desultory
habit
of
reading
especially
under
such
opportunities
of
gratifying
it
i
believe
one
reason
why
such
numerous
instances
of
erudition
occur
among
the
lower
ranks
is
that
with
the
same
powers
of
mind
the
poor
student
is
limited
to
a
narrow
circle
for
indulging
his
passion
for
books
and
must
necessarily
make
himself
master
of
the
few
he
possesses
ere
he
can
acquire
more
edward
on
the
contrary
like
the
epicure
who
only
deigned
to
take
a
single
morsel
from
the
sunny
side
of
a
peach
read
no
volume
a
moment
after
it
ceased
to
excite
his
curiosity
or
interest
and
it
necessarily
happened
that
the
habit
of
seeking
only
this
sort
of
gratification
rendered
it
daily
more
difficult
of
attainment
till
the
passion
for
reading
like
other
strong
appetites
produced
by
indulgence
a
sort
of
satiety
ere
he
attained
this
indifference
however
he
had
read
and
stored
in
a
memory
of
uncommon
tenacity
much
curious
though
arranged
and
miscellaneous
information
in
english
literature
he
was
master
of
shakespeare
and
milton
of
our
earlier
dramatic
authors
of
many
picturesque
and
interesting
passages
from
our
old
historical
chronicles
and
was
particularly
well
acquainted
with
spenser
drayton
and
other
poets
who
have
exercised
themselves
on
romantic
fiction
of
all
themes
the
most
fascinating
to
a
youthful
imagination
before
the
passions
have
roused
themselves
and
demand
poetry
of
a
more
sentimental
description
in
this
respect
his
acquaintance
with
italian
opened
him
yet
a
wider
range
he
had
perused
the
numerous
romantic
poems
which
from
the
days
of
pulci
have
been
a
favourite
exercise
of
the
wits
of
italy
and
had
sought
gratification
in
the
numerous
collections
of
novelle
which
were
brought
forth
by
the
genius
of
that
elegant
though
luxurious
nation
in
emulation
of
the
in
classical
literature
waverley
had
made
the
usual
progress
and
read
the
usual
authors
and
the
french
had
afforded
him
an
almost
exhaustless
collection
of
memoirs
scarcely
more
faithful
than
romances
and
of
romances
so
well
written
as
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
memoirs
the
splendid
pages
of
froissart
with
his
and
descriptions
of
war
and
of
tournaments
were
among
his
chief
favourites
and
from
those
of
brantome
and
de
la
noue
he
learned
to
compare
the
wild
and
loose
yet
superstitious
character
of
the
nobles
of
the
league
with
the
stern
rigid
and
sometimes
turbulent
disposition
of
the
huguenot
party
the
spanish
had
contributed
to
his
stock
of
chivalrous
and
romantic
lore
the
earlier
literature
of
the
northern
nations
did
not
escape
the
study
of
one
who
read
rather
to
awaken
the
imagination
than
to
benefit
the
understanding
and
yet
knowing
much
that
is
known
but
to
few
edward
waverley
might
justly
be
considered
as
ignorant
since
he
knew
little
of
what
adds
dignity
to
man
and
qualifies
him
to
support
and
adorn
an
elevated
situation
in
society
the
occasional
attention
of
his
parents
might
indeed
have
been
of
service
to
prevent
the
dissipation
of
mind
incidental
to
such
a
desultory
course
of
reading
but
his
mother
died
in
the
seventh
year
after
the
reconciliation
between
the
brothers
and
richard
waverley
himself
who
after
this
event
resided
more
constantly
in
london
was
too
much
interested
in
his
own
plans
of
wealth
and
ambition
to
notice
more
respecting
edward
than
that
he
was
of
a
very
bookish
turn
and
probably
destined
to
be
a
bishop
if
he
could
have
discovered
and
analysed
his
son
waking
dreams
he
would
have
formed
a
very
different
conclusion
chapter
iv
i
have
already
hinted
that
the
dainty
squeamish
and
fastidious
taste
acquired
by
a
surfeit
of
idle
reading
had
not
only
rendered
our
hero
unfit
for
serious
and
sober
study
but
had
even
disgusted
him
in
some
degree
with
that
in
which
he
had
hitherto
indulged
he
was
in
his
sixteenth
year
when
his
habits
of
abstraction
and
love
of
solitude
became
so
much
marked
as
to
excite
sir
affectionate
apprehension
he
tried
to
counterbalance
these
propensities
by
engaging
his
nephew
in
which
had
been
the
chief
pleasure
of
his
own
youthful
days
but
although
edward
eagerly
carried
the
gun
for
one
season
yet
when
practice
had
given
him
some
dexterity
the
pastime
ceased
to
afford
him
amusement
in
the
succeeding
spring
the
perusal
of
old
isaac
fascinating
volume
determined
edward
to
become
brother
of
the
angle
but
of
all
diversions
which
ingenuity
ever
devised
for
the
relief
of
idleness
fishing
is
the
worst
qualified
to
amuse
a
man
who
is
at
once
indolent
and
impatient
and
our
hero
rod
was
speedily
flung
aside
society
and
example
which
more
than
any
other
motives
master
and
sway
the
natural
bent
of
our
passions
might
have
had
their
usual
effect
upon
the
youthful
visionary
but
the
neighbourhood
was
thinly
inhabited
and
the
young
squires
whom
it
afforded
were
not
of
a
class
fit
to
form
usual
companions
far
less
to
excite
him
to
emulation
in
the
practice
of
those
pastimes
which
composed
the
serious
business
of
their
lives
there
were
a
few
other
youths
of
better
education
and
a
more
liberal
character
but
from
their
society
also
our
hero
was
in
some
degree
excluded
sir
everard
had
upon
the
death
of
queen
anne
resigned
his
seat
in
parliament
and
as
his
age
increased
and
the
number
of
his
contemporaries
diminished
had
gradually
withdrawn
himself
from
society
so
that
when
upon
any
particular
occasion
edward
mingled
with
accomplished
and
young
men
of
his
own
rank
and
expectations
he
felt
an
inferiority
in
their
company
not
so
much
from
deficiency
of
information
as
from
the
want
of
the
skill
to
command
and
to
arrange
that
which
he
possessed
a
deep
and
increasing
sensibility
added
to
this
dislike
of
society
the
idea
of
having
committed
the
slightest
solecism
in
politeness
whether
real
or
imaginary
was
agony
to
him
for
perhaps
even
guilt
itself
does
not
impose
upon
some
minds
so
keen
a
sense
of
shame
and
remorse
as
a
modest
sensitive
and
inexperienced
youth
feels
from
the
consciousness
of
having
neglected
etiquette
or
excited
ridicule
where
we
are
not
at
ease
we
can
not
be
happy
and
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
edward
waverley
supposed
that
he
disliked
and
was
unfitted
for
society
merely
because
he
had
not
yet
acquired
the
habit
of
living
in
it
with
ease
and
comfort
and
of
reciprocally
giving
and
receiving
pleasure
the
hours
he
spent
with
his
uncle
and
aunt
were
exhausted
in
listening
to
the
tale
of
narrative
old
age
yet
even
there
his
imagination
the
predominant
faculty
of
his
mind
was
frequently
excited
family
tradition
and
genealogical
history
upon
which
much
of
sir
everard
discourse
turned
is
the
very
reverse
of
amber
which
itself
a
valuable
substance
usually
includes
flies
straws
and
other
trifles
whereas
these
studies
being
themselves
very
insignificant
and
trifling
do
nevertheless
serve
to
perpetuate
a
great
deal
of
what
is
rare
and
valuable
in
ancient
manners
and
to
record
many
curious
and
minute
facts
which
could
have
been
preserved
and
conveyed
through
no
other
medium
if
therefore
edward
waverley
yawned
at
times
over
the
dry
deduction
of
his
line
of
ancestors
with
their
various
intermarriages
and
inwardly
deprecated
the
remorseless
and
protracted
accuracy
with
which
the
worthy
sir
everard
rehearsed
the
various
degrees
of
propinquity
between
the
house
of
honour
and
the
doughty
barons
knights
and
squires
to
whom
they
stood
allied
if
notwithstanding
his
obligations
to
the
three
ermines
passant
he
sometimes
cursed
in
his
heart
the
jargon
of
heraldry
its
griffins
its
moldwarps
its
wyverns
and
its
dragons
with
all
the
bitterness
of
hotspur
himself
there
were
moments
when
these
communications
interested
his
fancy
and
rewarded
his
attention
the
deeds
of
wilibert
of
waverley
in
the
holy
land
his
long
absence
and
perilous
adventures
his
supposed
death
and
his
return
on
the
evening
when
the
betrothed
of
his
heart
had
wedded
the
hero
who
had
protected
her
from
insult
and
oppression
during
his
absence
the
generosity
with
which
the
crusader
relinquished
his
claims
and
sought
in
a
neighbouring
cloister
that
peace
which
passeth
not
away
footnote
see
note
to
these
and
similar
tales
he
would
hearken
till
his
heart
glowed
and
his
eye
glistened
nor
was
he
less
affected
when
his
aunt
rachel
narrated
the
sufferings
and
fortitude
of
lady
alice
waverley
during
the
great
civil
war
the
benevolent
features
of
the
venerable
spinster
kindled
into
more
majestic
expression
as
she
told
how
charles
had
after
the
field
of
worcester
found
a
refuge
at
and
how
when
a
troop
of
cavalry
were
approaching
to
search
the
mansion
lady
alice
dismissed
her
youngest
son
with
a
handful
of
domestics
charging
them
to
make
good
with
their
lives
an
hour
diversion
that
the
king
might
have
that
space
for

god
help

would
rachel
continue
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
heroine
portrait
as
she
spoke
dearly
did
she
purchase
the
safety
of
her
prince
with
the
life
of
her
darling
child
they
brought
him
here
a
prisoner
mortally
wounded
and
you
may
trace
the
drops
of
his
blood
from
the
great
hall
door
along
the
little
gallery
and
up
to
the
saloon
where
they
laid
him
down
to
die
at
his
mother
feet
but
there
was
comfort
exchanged
between
them
for
he
knew
from
the
glance
of
his
mother
eye
that
the
purpose
of
his
desperate
defence
was
attained
ah
i
remember
she
continued
remember
well
to
have
seen
one
that
knew
and
loved
him
miss
lucy
saint
aubin
lived
and
died
a
maid
for
his
sake
though
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
wealthy
matches
in
this
country
all
the
world
ran
after
her
but
she
wore
widow
mourning
all
her
life
for
poor
william
for
they
were
betrothed
though
not
married
and
died
in
i
can
not
think
of
the
date
but
i
remember
in
the
november
of
that
very
year
when
she
found
herself
sinking
she
desired
to
be
brought
to
once
more
and
visited
all
the
places
where
she
had
been
with
my
and
caused
the
carpets
to
be
raised
that
she
might
trace
the
impression
of
his
blood
and
if
tears
could
have
washed
it
out
it
had
not
been
there
now
for
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
house
you
would
have
thought
edward
that
the
very
trees
mourned
for
her
for
their
leaves
dropt
around
her
without
a
gust
of
wind
and
indeed
she
looked
like
one
that
would
never
see
them
green
again
from
such
legends
our
hero
would
steal
away
to
indulge
the
fancies
they
excited
in
the
corner
of
the
large
and
sombre
library
with
no
other
light
than
was
afforded
by
the
decaying
brands
on
its
ponderous
and
ample
hearth
he
would
exercise
for
hours
that
internal
sorcery
by
which
past
or
imaginary
events
are
presented
in
action
as
it
were
to
the
eye
of
the
muser
then
arose
in
long
and
fair
array
the
splendour
of
the
bridal
feast
at
castle
the
tall
and
emaciated
form
of
its
real
lord
as
he
stood
in
his
pilgrim
weeds
an
unnoticed
spectator
of
the
festivities
of
his
supposed
heir
and
intended
bride
the
electrical
shock
occasioned
by
the
discovery
the
springing
of
the
vassals
to
arms
the
astonishment
of
the
bridegroom
the
terror
and
confusion
of
the
bride
the
agony
with
which
wilibert
observed
that
her
heart
as
well
as
consent
was
in
these
nuptials
the
air
of
dignity
yet
of
deep
feeling
with
which
he
flung
down
the
sword
and
turned
away
for
ever
from
the
house
of
his
ancestors
then
would
he
change
the
scene
and
fancy
would
at
his
wish
represent
aunt
rachel
tragedy
he
saw
the
lady
waverley
seated
in
her
bower
her
ear
strained
to
every
sound
her
heart
throbbing
with
double
agony
now
listening
to
the
decaying
echo
of
the
hoofs
of
the
king
horse
and
when
that
had
died
away
hearing
in
every
breeze
that
shook
the
trees
of
the
park
the
noise
of
the
remote
skirmish
a
distant
sound
is
heard
like
the
rushing
of
a
swoln
stream
it
comes
nearer
and
edward
can
plainly
distinguish
the
galloping
of
horses
the
cries
and
shouts
of
men
with
straggling
between
rolling
forwards
to
the
hall
the
lady
starts
up
a
terrified
menial
rushes
in
but
why
pursue
such
a
description
as
living
in
this
ideal
world
became
daily
more
delectable
to
our
hero
interruption
was
disagreeable
in
proportion
the
extensive
domain
that
surrounded
the
hall
which
far
exceeding
the
dimensions
of
a
park
was
usually
termed
had
originally
been
forest
ground
and
still
though
broken
by
extensive
glades
in
which
the
young
deer
were
sporting
retained
its
pristine
and
savage
character
it
was
traversed
by
broad
avenues
in
many
places
half
grown
up
with
where
the
beauties
of
former
days
used
to
take
their
stand
to
see
the
stag
coursed
with
greyhounds
or
to
gain
an
aim
at
him
with
the
crossbow
in
one
spot
distinguished
by
a
gothic
monument
which
retained
the
name
of
queen
standing
elizabeth
herself
was
said
to
have
pierced
seven
bucks
with
her
own
arrows
this
was
a
very
favourite
haunt
of
waverley
at
other
times
with
his
gun
and
his
spaniel
which
served
as
an
apology
to
others
and
with
a
book
in
his
pocket
which
perhaps
served
as
an
apology
to
himself
he
used
to
pursue
one
of
these
long
avenues
which
after
an
ascending
sweep
of
four
miles
gradually
narrowed
into
a
rude
and
contracted
path
through
the
cliffy
and
woody
pass
called
mirkwood
dingle
and
opened
suddenly
upon
a
deep
dark
and
small
lake
named
from
the
same
cause
there
stood
in
former
times
a
solitary
tower
upon
a
rock
almost
surrounded
by
the
water
which
had
acquired
the
name
of
the
strength
of
waverley
because
in
perilous
times
it
had
often
been
the
refuge
of
the
family
there
in
the
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
the
last
adherents
of
the
red
rose
who
dared
to
maintain
her
cause
carried
on
a
harassing
and
predatory
warfare
till
the
stronghold
was
reduced
by
the
celebrated
richard
of
gloucester
here
too
a
party
of
cavaliers
long
maintained
themselves
under
nigel
waverley
elder
brother
of
that
william
whose
fate
aunt
rachel
commemorated
through
these
scenes
it
was
that
edward
loved
to
the
cud
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
and
like
a
child
among
his
toys
culled
and
arranged
from
the
splendid
yet
useless
imagery
and
emblems
with
which
his
imagination
was
stored
visions
as
brilliant
and
as
fading
as
those
of
an
evening
sky
the
effect
of
this
indulgence
upon
his
temper
and
character
will
appear
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
v
choice
of
a
profession
from
the
minuteness
with
which
i
have
traced
waverley
pursuits
and
the
bias
which
these
unavoidably
communicated
to
his
imagination
the
reader
may
perhaps
anticipate
in
the
following
tale
an
imitation
of
the
romance
of
cervantes
but
he
will
do
my
prudence
injustice
in
the
supposition
my
intention
is
not
to
follow
the
steps
of
that
inimitable
author
in
describing
such
total
perversion
of
intellect
as
misconstrues
the
objects
actually
presented
to
the
senses
but
that
more
common
aberration
from
sound
judgment
which
apprehends
occurrences
indeed
in
their
reality
but
communicates
to
them
a
tincture
of
its
own
romantic
tone
and
colouring
so
far
was
edward
waverley
from
expecting
general
sympathy
with
his
own
feelings
or
concluding
that
the
present
state
of
things
was
calculated
to
exhibit
the
reality
of
those
visions
in
which
he
loved
to
indulge
that
he
dreaded
nothing
more
than
the
detection
of
such
sentiments
as
were
dictated
by
his
musings
he
neither
had
nor
wished
to
have
a
confidant
with
whom
to
communicate
his
reveries
and
so
sensible
was
he
of
the
ridicule
attached
to
them
that
had
he
been
to
choose
between
any
punishment
short
of
ignominy
and
the
necessity
of
giving
a
cold
and
composed
account
of
the
ideal
world
in
which
he
lived
the
better
part
of
his
days
i
think
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
prefer
the
former
infliction
this
secrecy
became
doubly
precious
as
he
felt
in
advancing
life
the
influence
of
the
awakening
passions
female
forms
of
exquisite
grace
and
beauty
began
to
mingle
in
his
mental
adventures
nor
was
he
long
without
looking
abroad
to
compare
the
creatures
of
his
own
imagination
with
the
females
of
actual
life
the
list
of
the
beauties
who
displayed
their
hebdomadal
finery
at
the
parish
church
of
waverley
was
neither
numerous
nor
select
by
far
the
most
passable
was
miss
sissly
or
as
she
rather
chose
to
be
called
miss
cecilia
stubbs
daughter
of
squire
stubbs
at
the
grange
i
know
not
whether
it
was
by
the
accident
in
the
world
a
phrase
which
from
female
lips
does
not
always
exclude
malice
prepense
or
whether
it
was
from
a
conformity
of
taste
that
miss
cecilia
more
than
once
crossed
edward
in
his
favourite
walks
through
he
had
not
as
yet
assumed
courage
to
accost
her
on
these
occasions
but
the
meeting
was
not
without
its
effect
a
romantic
lover
is
a
strange
idolater
who
sometimes
cares
not
out
of
what
log
he
frames
the
object
of
his
adoration
at
least
if
nature
has
given
that
object
any
passable
proportion
of
personal
charms
he
can
easily
play
the

into

her
at
least
to

level
with
the
saint
her
namesake
rachel
waverley
gained
some
intimation
which
determined
her
to
prevent
the
approaching
apotheosis
even
the
most
simple
and
unsuspicious
of

sharpness

perception

goes
the
length
of
observing
partialities
that
never
existed
but
rarely
misses
to
detect
such
as
pass
actually
under
their
observation
rachel
applied
herself
with
great
prudence
not
to
combat
but
to
elude
the
approaching
danger
and
suggested
to
her
brother
the
necessity
that
the
heir
of
his
house
should
see
something
more
of
the
world
than
was
consistent
with
constant
residence
at
sir
everard
would
not
at
first
listen
to
a
proposal
which
went
to
separate
his
nephew
from
him
edward
was
a
little
bookish
he
admitted
but
youth
he
had
always
heard
was
the
season
for
learning
and
no
doubt
when
his
rage
for
letters
was
abated
and
his
head
fully
stocked
with
knowledge
his
nephew
would
take
to
and
country
business
he
had
often
he
said
himself
regretted
that
he
had
not
spent
some
time
in
study
during
his
youth
he
would
neither
have
shot
nor
hunted
with
less
skill
and
he
might
have
made
the
roof
of
saint
stephen
echo
to
longer
orations
than
were
comprised
in
those
zealous
noes
with
which
when
a
member
of
the
house
during
godolphin
administration
he
encountered
every
measure
of
government
aunt
rachel
anxiety
however
lent
her
address
to
carry
her
point
every
representative
of
their
house
had
visited
foreign
parts
or
served
his
country
in
the
army
before
he
settled
for
life
at
and
she
appealed
for
the
truth
of
her
assertion
to
the
genealogical
pedigree
an
authority
which
sir
everard
was
never
known
to
contradict
in
short
a
proposal
was
made
to
richard
waverley
that
his
son
should
travel
under
the
direction
of
his
present
tutor
pembroke
with
a
suitable
allowance
from
the
baronet
liberality
the
father
himself
saw
no
objection
to
this
overture
but
upon
mentioning
it
casually
at
the
table
of
the
minister
the
great
man
looked
grave
the
reason
was
explained
in
private
the
unhappy
turn
of
sir
everard
politics
the
minister
observed
was
such
as
would
render
it
highly
improper
that
a
young
gentleman
of
such
hopeful
prospects
should
travel
on
the
continent
with
a
tutor
doubtless
of
his
uncle
choosing
and
directing
his
course
by
his
instructions
what
might
edward
waverley
society
be
at
paris
what
at
rome
where
all
manner
of
snares
were
spread
by
the
pretender
and
his
sons
these
were
points
for
waverley
to
consider
this
he
could
himself
say
that
he
knew
his
majesty
had
such
a
just
sense
of
richard
waverley
merits
that
if
his
son
adopted
the
army
for
a
few
years
a
troop
he
believed
might
be
reckoned
upon
in
one
of
the
dragoon
regiments
lately
returned
from
flanders
a
hint
thus
conveyed
and
enforced
was
not
to
be
neglected
with
impunity
and
richard
waverley
though
with
great
dread
of
shocking
his
brother
prejudices
deemed
he
could
not
avoid
accepting
the
commission
thus
offered
him
for
his
son
the
truth
is
he
calculated
much
and
justly
upon
sir
everard
fondness
for
edward
which
made
him
unlikely
to
resent
any
step
that
he
might
take
in
due
submission
to
parental
authority
two
letters
announced
this
determination
to
the
baronet
and
his
nephew
the
latter
barely
communicated
the
fact
and
pointed
out
the
necessary
preparations
for
joining
his
regiment
to
his
brother
richard
was
more
diffuse
and
circuitous
he
coincided
with
him
in
the
most
flattering
manner
in
the
propriety
of
his
son
seeing
a
little
more
of
the
world
and
was
even
humble
in
expressions
of
gratitude
for
his
proposed
assistance
was
however
deeply
concerned
that
it
was
now
unfortunately
not
in
edward
power
exactly
to
comply
with
the
plan
which
had
been
chalked
out
by
his
best
friend
and
benefactor
he
himself
had
thought
with
pain
on
the
inactivity
at
an
age
when
all
his
ancestors
had
borne
arms
even
royalty
itself
had
deigned
to
inquire
whether
young
waverley
was
not
now
in
flanders
at
an
age
when
his
grandfather
was
already
bleeding
for
his
king
in
the
great
civil
war
this
was
accompanied
by
an
offer
of
a
troop
of
horse
what
could
he
do
there
was
no
time
to
consult
his
brother
inclinations
even
if
he
could
have
conceived
there
might
be
objections
on
his
part
to
his
following
the
glorious
career
of
his
predecessors
and
in
short
that
edward
was
now
the
intermediate
steps
of
cornet
and
lieutenant
being
overleapt
with
great
agility
captain
waverley
of
gardiner
regiment
of
dragoons
which
he
must
join
in
their
quarters
at
dundee
in
scotland
in
the
course
of
a
month
sir
everard
waverley
received
this
intimation
with
a
mixture
of
feelings
at
the
period
of
the
hanoverian
succession
he
had
withdrawn
from
parliament
and
his
conduct
in
the
memorable
year
had
not
been
altogether
unsuspected
there
were
reports
of
private
musters
of
tenants
and
horses
in
by
moonlight
and
of
cases
of
carbines
and
pistols
purchased
in
holland
and
addressed
to
the
baronet
but
intercepted
by
the
vigilance
of
a
riding
officer
of
the
excise
who
was
afterwards
tossed
in
a
blanket
on
a
moonless
night
by
an
association
of
stout
yeomen
for
his
officiousness
nay
it
was
even
said
that
at
the
arrest
of
sir
william
wyndham
the
leader
of
the
tory
party
a
letter
from
sir
everard
was
found
in
the
pocket
of
his
but
there
was
no
overt
act
which
an
attainder
could
be
founded
on
and
government
contented
with
suppressing
the
insurrection
of
felt
it
neither
prudent
nor
safe
to
push
their
vengeance
farther
than
against
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
actually
took
up
arms
nor
did
sir
everard
apprehensions
of
personal
consequences
seem
to
correspond
with
the
reports
spread
among
his
whig
neighbours
it
was
well
known
that
he
had
supplied
with
money
several
of
the
distressed
northumbrians
and
scotchmen
who
after
being
made
prisoners
at
preston
in
lancashire
were
imprisoned
in
newgate
and
the
marshalsea
and
it
was
his
solicitor
and
ordinary
counsel
who
conducted
the
defence
of
some
of
these
unfortunate
gentlemen
at
their
trial
it
was
generally
supposed
however
that
had
ministers
possessed
any
real
proof
of
sir
everard
accession
to
the
rebellion
he
either
would
not
have
ventured
thus
to
brave
the
existing
government
or
at
least
would
not
have
done
so
with
impunity
the
feelings
which
then
dictated
his
proceedings
were
those
of
a
young
man
and
at
an
agitating
period
since
that
time
sir
everard
jacobitism
had
been
gradually
decaying
like
a
fire
which
burns
out
for
want
of
fuel
his
tory
and
principles
were
kept
up
by
some
occasional
exercise
at
elections
and
but
those
respecting
hereditary
right
were
fallen
into
a
sort
of
abeyance
yet
it
jarred
severely
upon
his
feelings
that
his
nephew
should
go
into
the
army
under
the
brunswick
dynasty
and
the
more
so
as
independent
of
his
high
and
conscientious
ideas
of
paternal
authority
it
was
impossible
or
at
least
highly
imprudent
to
interfere
authoritatively
to
prevent
it
this
suppressed
vexation
gave
rise
to
many
poohs
and
pshaws
which
were
placed
to
the
account
of
an
incipient
fit
of
gout
until
having
sent
for
the
army
list
the
worthy
baronet
consoled
himself
with
reckoning
the
descendants
of
the
houses
of
genuine
loyalty
mordaunts
granvilles
and
stanleys
whose
names
were
to
be
found
in
that
military
record
and
calling
up
all
his
feelings
of
family
grandeur
and
warlike
glory
he
concluded
with
logic
something
like
falstaff
that
when
war
was
at
hand
although
it
were
shame
to
be
on
any
side
but
one
it
were
worse
shame
to
be
idle
than
to
be
on
the
worst
side
though
blacker
than
usurpation
could
make
it
as
for
aunt
rachel
her
scheme
had
not
exactly
terminated
according
to
her
wishes
but
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
submitting
to
circumstances
and
her
mortification
was
diverted
by
the
employment
she
found
in
fitting
out
her
nephew
for
the
campaign
and
greatly
consoled
by
the
prospect
of
beholding
him
blaze
in
complete
uniform
edward
waverley
himself
received
with
animated
and
undefined
surprise
this
most
unexpected
intelligence
it
was
as
a
fine
old
poem
expresses
it
a
fire
to
heather
set
that
covers
a
solitary
hill
with
smoke
and
illumines
it
at
the
same
time
with
dusky
fire
his
tutor
or
i
should
say
pembroke
for
he
scarce
assumed
the
name
of
tutor
picked
up
about
edward
room
some
fragments
of
irregular
verse
which
he
appeared
to
have
composed
under
the
influence
of
the
agitating
feelings
occasioned
by
this
sudden
page
being
turned
up
to
him
in
the
book
of
life
the
doctor
who
was
a
believer
in
all
poetry
which
was
composed
by
his
friends
and
written
out
in
fair
straight
lines
with
a
capital
at
the
beginning
of
each
communicated
this
treasure
to
aunt
rachel
who
with
her
spectacles
dimmed
with
tears
transferred
them
to
her
commonplace
book
among
choice
receipts
for
cookery
and
medicine
favourite
texts
and
portions
from
divines
and
a
few
songs
amatory
and
jacobitical
which
she
had
carolled
in
her
younger
days
from
whence
her
nephew
poetical
tentamina
were
extracted
when
the
volume
itself
with
other
authentic
records
of
the
waverley
family
were
exposed
to
the
inspection
of
the
unworthy
editor
of
this
memorable
history
if
they
afford
the
reader
no
higher
amusement
they
will
serve
at
least
better
than
narrative
of
any
kind
to
acquaint
him
with
the
wild
and
irregular
spirit
of
our
hero
late
when
the
autumn
evening
fell

from

and

a
world
than

to

and
roused
the
genius
of

as

bade
his
surge

that
fond
ideal
world
and
to
the
shore
in

tost
the
realms
of

bliss
were
lost

with
a
stern
delight
and
strange
i
saw
the
change
as
warr

tranquil
scene

loud
of

each
fair
vision
pass
away
like
landscape
on

lay

as

that
glided
by
while
dreams
of
love
and
lady
charms
give
place
to
honour
and
to
arms
in
sober
prose
as
perhaps
these
verses
intimate
less
decidedly
the
transient
idea
of
miss
cecilia
stubbs
passed
from
captain
waverley
heart
amid
the
turmoil
which
his
new
destinies
excited
she
appeared
indeed
in
full
splendour
in
her
father
pew
upon
the
sunday
when
he
attended
service
for
the
last
time
at
the
old
parish
church
upon
which
occasion
at
the
request
of
his
uncle
and
aunt
rachel
he
was
induced
nothing
both
if
the
truth
must
be
told
to
present
himself
in
full
uniform
there
is
no
better
antidote
against
entertaining
too
high
an
opinion
of
others
than
having
an
excellent
one
of
ourselves
at
the
very
same
time
miss
stubbs
had
indeed
summoned
up
every
assistance
which
art
could
afford
to
beauty
but
alas
hoop
patches
frizzled
locks
and
a
new
mantua
of
genuine
french
silk
were
lost
upon
a
young
officer
of
dragoons
who
wore
for
the
first
time
his
hat
and
broadsword
i
know
not
whether
like
the
champion
of
an
old
ballad
his
heart
was
all
on
honour
bent
he
could
not
stoop
to
love
no
lady
in
the
land
had
power
his
frozen
heart
to
move
or
whether
the
deep
and
flaming
bars
of
embroidered
gold
which
now
fenced
his
breast
defied
the
artillery
of
cecilia
eyes
but
every
arrow
was
launched
at
him
in
vain
yet
did
i
mark
where
cupid
shaft
did
light
it
lighted
not
on
little
western
flower
but
on
bold
yeoman

of
all

west

jonas
culbertfield
the
steward
son
craving
pardon
for
my
heroics
which
i
am
unable
in
certain
cases
to
resist
giving
way
to
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
my
history
must
here
take
leave
of
the
fair
cecilia
who
like
many
a
daughter
of
eve
after
the
departure
of
edward
and
the
dissipation
of
certain
idle
visions
which
she
had
adopted
quietly
contented
herself
with
a
pisaller
and
gave
her
hand
at
the
distance
of
six
months
to
the
aforesaid
jonas
son
of
the
baronet
steward
and
heir
no
unfertile
prospect
to
a
fortune
besides
the
snug
probability
of
succeeding
to
his
father
office
all
these
advantages
moved
squire
stubbs
as
much
as
the
ruddy
brown
and
manly
form
of
the
suitor
influenced
his
daughter
to
abate
somewhat
in
the
article
of
their
gentry
and
so
the
match
was
concluded
none
seemed
more
gratified
than
aunt
rachel
who
had
hitherto
looked
rather
askance
upon
the
presumptuous
damsel
as
much
so
peradventure
as
her
nature
would
permit
but
who
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
pair
at
church
honoured
the
bride
with
a
smile
and
a
profound
curtsy
in
presence
of
the
rector
the
curate
the
clerk
and
the
whole
congregation
of
the
united
parishes
of
waverley
cum
beverley
i
beg
pardon
once
and
for
all
of
those
readers
who
take
up
novels
merely
for
amusement
for
plaguing
them
so
long
with
fashioned
politics
and
whig
and
tory
and
hanoverians
and
jacobites
the
truth
is
i
can
not
promise
them
that
this
story
shall
be
intelligible
not
to
say
probable
without
it
my
plan
requires
that
i
should
explain
the
motives
on
which
its
action
proceeded
and
these
motives
necessarily
arose
from
the
feelings

and

of

do
not
invite
my
fair

whose
sex
and
impatience
give
them
the

right
to
complain
of

vi
the

of

it
was
upon
the
evening
of
this
memorable
sunday
that
sir
everard
entered
the
library

he
narrowly
missed
surprising
our
young
hero
as
he
went
through
the
guards
of
the
broadsword
with
the
ancient
weapon
of
old
sir
hildebrand
which
being
preserved
as
an
heirloom
usually
hung
over
the
chimney
in
the
library
beneath
a
picture
of
the
knight
and
his
horse
where
the
features
were
almost
entirely
hidden
by
the
knight
profusion
of
curled
hair
and
the
bucephalus
which
he
bestrode
concealed
by
the
voluminous
robes
of
the
bath
with
which
he
was
decorated
sir
everard
entered
and
after
a
glance
at
the
picture
and
another
at
his
nephew
began
a
little
speech
which
however
soon
dropt
into
the
natural
simplicity
of
his
common
manner
agitated
upon
the
present
occasion
by
no
common
feeling
he
said
and
then
as
mending
his
phrase
dear
edward
it
is
god
will
and
also
the
will
of
your
father
whom
under
god
it
is
your
duty
to
obey
that
you
should
leave
us
to
take
up
the
profession
of
arms
in
which
so
many
of
your
ancestors
have
been
distinguished
i
have
made
such
arrangements
as
will
enable
you
to
take
the
field
as
their
descendant
and
as
the
probable
heir
of
the
house
of
waverley
and
sir
in
the
field
of
battle
you
will
remember
what
name
you
bear
and
edward
my
dear
boy
remember
also
that
you
are
the
last
of
that
race
and
the
only
hope
of
its
revival
depends
upon
you
therefore
as
far
as
duty
and
honour
will
permit
avoid
danger
i
mean
unnecessary
danger
and
keep
no
company
with
rakes
gamblers
and
whigs
of
whom
it
is
to
be
feared
there
are
but
too
many
in
the
service
into
which
you
are
going
your
colonel
as
i
am
informed
is
an
excellent
man
for
a
presbyterian
but
you
will
remember
your
duty
to
god
the
church
of
england
and
the
this
breach
ought
to
have
been
supplied
according
to
the
rubric
with
the
word
king
but
as
unfortunately
that
word
conveyed
a
double
and
embarrassing
sense
one
meaning
de
facto
and
the
other
de
jure
the
knight
filled
up
the
blank
otherwise
church
of
england
and
all
constituted
authorities
then
not
trusting
himself
with
any
further
oratory
he
carried
his
nephew
to
his
stables
to
see
the
horses
destined
for
his
campaign
two
were
black
the
regimental
colour
superb
chargers
both
the
other
three
were
stout
active
hacks
designed
for
the
road
or
for
his
domestics
of
whom
two
were
to
attend
him
from
the
hall
an
additional
groom
if
necessary
might
be
picked
up
in
scotland
will
depart
with
but
a
small
retinue
quoth
the
baronet
to
sir
hildebrand
when
he
mustered
before
the
gate
of
the
hall
a
larger
body
of
horse
than
your
whole
regiment
consists
of
i
could
have
wished
that
these
twenty
young
fellows
from
my
estate
who
have
enlisted
in
your
troop
had
been
to
march
with
you
on
your
journey
to
scotland
it
would
have
been
something
at
least
but
i
am
told
their
attendance
would
be
thought
unusual
in
these
days
when
every
new
and
foolish
fashion
is
introduced
to
break
the
natural
dependence
of
the
people
upon
their
landlords
sir
everard
had
done
his
best
to
correct
this
unnatural
disposition
of
the
times
for
he
had
brightened
the
chain
of
attachment
between
the
recruits
and
their
young
captain
not
only
by
a
copious
repast
of
beef
and
ale
by
way
of
parting
feast
but
by
such
a
pecuniary
donation
to
each
individual
as
tended
rather
to
improve
the
conviviality
than
the
discipline
of
their
march
after
inspecting
the
cavalry
sir
everard
again
conducted
his
nephew
to
the
library
where
he
produced
a
letter
carefully
folded
surrounded
by
a
little
stripe
of
according
to
ancient
form
and
sealed
with
an
accurate
impression
of
the
waverley
it
was
addressed
with
great
formality
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
of
bradwardine
at
his
principal
mansion
of
in
perthshire
north
britain
these
by
the
hands
of
captain
edward
waverley
nephew
of
sir
everard
waverley
of
bart
the
gentleman
to
whom
this
enormous
greeting
was
addressed
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
say
in
the
sequel
had
been
in
arms
for
the
exiled
family
of
stuart
in
the
year
and
was
made
prisoner
at
preston
in
lancashire
he
was
of
a
very
ancient
family
and
somewhat
embarrassed
fortune
a
scholar
according
to
the
scholarship
of
scotchmen
that
is
his
learning
was
more
diffuse
than
accurate
and
he
was
rather
a
reader
than
a
grammarian
of
his
zeal
for
the
classic
authors
he
is
said
to
have
given
an
uncommon
instance
on
the
road
between
preston
and
london
he
made
his
escape
from
his
guards
but
being
afterwards
found
loitering
near
the
place
where
they
had
lodged
the
former
night
he
was
recognised
and
again
arrested
his
companions
and
even
his
escort
were
surprised
at
his
infatuation
and
could
not
help
inquiring
why
being
once
at
liberty
he
had
not
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
a
place
of
safety
to
which
he
replied
that
he
had
intended
to
do
so
but
in
good
faith
he
had
returned
to
seek
his
titus
livius
which
he
had
forgot
in
the
hurry
of
his
escape
footnote
see
note
the
simplicity
of
this
anecdote
struck
the
gentleman
who
as
we
before
observed
had
managed
the
defence
of
some
of
those
unfortunate
persons
at
the
expense
of
sir
everard
and
perhaps
some
others
of
the
party
he
was
besides
himself
a
special
admirer
of
the
old
patavinian
and
though
probably
his
own
zeal
might
not
have
carried
him
such
extravagant
lengths
even
to
recover
the
edition
of
sweynheim
and
pannartz
supposed
to
be
the
princeps
he
did
not
the
less
estimate
the
devotion
of
the
north
briton
and
in
consequence
exerted
himself
to
so
much
purpose
to
remove
and
soften
evidence
detect
legal
flaws
et
cetera
that
he
accomplished
the
final
discharge
and
deliverance
of
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
from
certain
very
awkward
consequences
of
a
plea
before
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
in
westminster
the
baron
of
bradwardine
for
he
was
generally
so
called
in
scotland
although
his
intimates
from
his
place
of
residence
used
to
denominate
him
or
more
familiarly
tully
no
sooner
stood
rectus
in
curia
than
he
posted
down
to
pay
his
respects
and
make
his
acknowledgments
at
a
congenial
passion
for
and
a
general
coincidence
in
political
opinions
cemented
his
friendship
with
sir
everard
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
their
habits
and
studies
in
other
particulars
and
having
spent
several
weeks
at
honour
the
baron
departed
with
many
expressions
of
regard
warmly
pressing
the
baronet
to
return
his
visit
and
partake
of
the
diversion
of
upon
his
moors
in
perthshire
next
season
shortly
after
bradwardine
remitted
from
scotland
a
sum
in
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred
in
the
king
high
court
of
westminster
which
although
not
quite
so
formidable
when
reduced
to
the
english
denomination
had
in
its
original
form
of
scotch
pounds
shillings
and
pence
such
a
formidable
effect
upon
the
frame
of
duncan
macwheeble
the
laird
confidential
factor
and
man
of
resource
that
he
had
a
fit
of
the
cholic
which
lasted
for
five
days
occasioned
he
said
solely
and
utterly
by
becoming
the
unhappy
instrument
of
conveying
such
a
serious
sum
of
money
out
of
his
native
country
into
the
hands
of
the
false
english
but
patriotism
as
it
is
the
fairest
so
it
is
often
the
most
suspicious
mask
of
other
feelings
and
many
who
knew
bailie
macwheeble
concluded
that
his
professions
of
regret
were
not
altogether
disinterested
and
that
he
would
have
grudged
the
moneys
paid
to
the
loons
at
westminster
much
less
had
they
not
come
from
bradwardine
estate
a
fund
which
he
considered
as
more
particularly
his
own
but
the
bailie
protested
he
was
absolutely
disinterested
woe
for
scotland
not
a
whit
for
me
the
laird
was
only
rejoiced
that
his
worthy
friend
sir
everard
waverley
of
was
reimbursed
of
the
expenditure
which
he
had
outlaid
on
account
of
the
house
of
bradwardine
it
concerned
he
said
the
credit
of
his
own
family
and
of
the
kingdom
of
scotland
at
large
that
these
disbursements
should
be
repaid
forthwith
and
if
delayed
it
would
be
a
matter
of
national
reproach
sir
everard
accustomed
to
treat
much
larger
sums
with
indifference
received
the
remittance
of
without
being
aware
that
the
payment
was
an
international
concern
and
indeed
would
probably
have
forgot
the
circumstance
altogether
if
bailie
macwheeble
had
thought
of
comforting
his
cholic
by
intercepting
the
subsidy
a
yearly
intercourse
took
place
of
a
short
letter
and
a
hamper
or
a
cask
or
two
between
and
the
english
exports
consisting
of
mighty
cheeses
and
mightier
ale
pheasants
and
venison
and
the
scottish
returns
being
vested
in
grouse
white
hares
pickled
salmon
and
usquebaugh
all
which
were
meant
sent
and
received
as
pledges
of
constant
friendship
and
amity
between
two
important
houses
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
of
could
not
with
propriety
visit
scotland
without
being
furnished
with
credentials
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
when
this
matter
was
explained
and
settled
pembroke
expressed
his
wish
to
take
a
private
and
particular
leave
of
his
dear
pupil
the
good
man
ex
hortations
to
edward
to
preserve
an
unblemished
life
and
morals
to
hold
fast
the
principles
of
the
christian
religion
and
to
eschew
the
profane
company
of
scoffers
and
latitudinarians
too
much
abounding
in
the
army
were
not
unmingled
with
his
political
prejudices
it
had
pleased
heaven
he
said
to
place
scotland
doubtless
for
the
sins
of
their
ancestors
in
in
a
more
deplorable
state
of
darkness
than
even
this
unhappy
kingdom
of
england
here
at
least
although
the
candlestick
of
the
church
of
england
had
been
in
some
degree
removed
from
its
place
it
yet
afforded
a
glimmering
light
there
was
a
hierarchy
though
schismatical
and
fallen
from
the
principles
maintained
by
those
great
fathers
of
the
church
sancroft
and
his
brethren
there
was
a
liturgy
though
woefully
perverted
in
some
of
the
principal
petitions
but
in
scotland
it
was
utter
darkness
and
excepting
a
sorrowful
scattered
and
persecuted
remnant
the
pulpits
were
abandoned
to
presbyterians
and
he
feared
to
sectaries
of
every
description
it
should
be
his
duty
to
fortify
his
dear
pupil
to
resist
such
unhallowed
and
pernicious
doctrines
in
church
and
state
as
must
necessarily
be
forced
at
times
upon
his
unwilling
ears
here
he
produced
two
immense
folded
packets
which
appeared
each
to
contain
a
whole
ream
of
closely
written
manuscript
they
had
been
the
labour
of
the
worthy
man
whole
life
and
never
were
labour
and
zeal
more
absurdly
wasted
he
had
at
one
time
gone
to
london
with
the
intention
of
giving
them
to
the
world
by
the
medium
of
a
bookseller
in
little
britain
well
known
to
deal
in
such
commodities
and
to
whom
he
was
instructed
to
address
himself
in
a
particular
phrase
and
with
a
certain
sign
which
it
seems
passed
at
that
time
current
among
the
initiated
jacobites
the
moment
pembroke
had
uttered
the
shibboleth
with
the
appropriate
gesture
the
bibliopolist
greeted
him
notwithstanding
every
disclamation
by
the
title
of
doctor
and
conveying
him
into
his
back
shop
after
inspecting
every
possible
and
impossible
place
of
concealment
he
commenced

under

how

light
its
candle
at
the
old
eh
what
cautious
i
like
you
the
better
but
no
fear
here
pembroke
with
some
difficulty
stopt
a
torrent
of
interrogations
eked
out
with
signs
nods
and
winks
and
having
at
length
convinced
the
bookseller
that
he
did
him
too
much
honour
in
supposing
him
an
emissary
of
exiled
royalty
he
explained
his
actual
business
the
man
of
books
with
a
much
more
composed
air
proceeded
to
examine
the
manuscripts
the
title
of
the
first
was
dissent
from
dissenters
or
the
comprehension
confuted
showing
the
impossibility
of
any
composition
between
the
church
and
puritans
presbyterians
or
sectaries
of
any
description
illustrated
from
the
scriptures
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
the
soundest
controversial
divines
to
this
work
the
bookseller
positively
demurred
meant
he
said
learned
doubtless
but
the
time
had
gone
by
printed
on
it
would
run
to
eight
hundred
pages
and
could
never
pay
begged
therefore
to
be
excused

honoured
the
true

his
soul

had
it
been
a
sermon
on
the
martyrdom
or
any
touch

i
would
venture
something
for
the
honour
of
the

you
what
once
a

when
a

does
not

where
to

i
must
show
the

every

the
next
day
pembroke
again
called
on
the
publisher
but
found
tom
alibi
advice
had
determined
him
against
undertaking
the
work
but
what
i
would
go
to
what
was
i
going
to
say
to
the
plantations
for
the
church
with
pleasure
but
dear
doctor
i
have
a
wife
and
family
but
to
show
my
zeal
i
recommend
the
job
to
my
neighbour
trimmel
he
is
a
bachelor
and
leaving
off
business
so
a
voyage
in
a
western
barge
would
not
inconvenience
him
but
trimmel
was
also
obdurate
and
pembroke
fortunately
perchance
for
himself
was
compelled
to
return
to
with
his
treatise
in
vindication
of
the
real
fundamental
principles
of
church
and
state
safely
packed
in
his
as
the
public
were
thus
likely
to
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
arising
from
his
lucubrations
by
the
selfish
cowardice
of
the
trade
pembroke
resolved
to
make
two
copies
of
these
tremendous
manuscripts
for
the
use
of
his
pupil
he
felt
that
he
had
been
indolent
as
a
tutor
and
besides
his
conscience
checked
him
for
complying
with
the
request
of
richard
waverley
that
he
would
impress
no
sentiments
upon
edward
mind
inconsistent
with
the
present
settlement
in
church
and
state
but
now
thought
he
i
may
without
breach
of
my
word
since
he
is
no
longer
under
my
tuition
afford
the
youth
the
means
of
judging
for
himself
and
have
only
to
dread
his
reproaches
for
so
long
concealing
the
light
which
the
perusal
will
flash
upon
his
mind
while
he
thus
indulged
the
reveries
of
an
author
and
a
politician
his
darling
proselyte
seeing
nothing
very
inviting
in
the
title
of
the
tracts
and
appalled
by
the
bulk
and
compact
lines
of
the
manuscript
quietly
consigned
them
to
a
corner
of
his
travelling
trunk
aunt
rachel
farewell
was
brief
and
affectionate
she
only
cautioned
her
dear
edward
whom
she
probably
deemed
somewhat
susceptible
against
the
fascination
of
scottish
beauty
she
allowed
that
the
northern
part
of
the
island
contained
some
ancient
families
but
they
were
all
whigs
and
presbyterians
except
the
highlanders
and
respecting
them
she
must
needs
say
there
could
be
no
great
delicacy
among
the
ladies
where
the
usual
attire
was
as
she
had
been
assured
to
say
the
least
very
singular
and
not
at
all
decorous
she
concluded
her
farewell
with
a
kind
and
moving
benediction
and
gave
the
young
officer
as
a
pledge
of
her
regard
a
valuable
diamond
ring
often
worn
by
the
male
sex
at
that
time
and
a
purse
of
broad
which
also
were
more
common
sixty
years
since

they
have
been

vii
a
in
scotland
the
next
morning
amid
varied
feelings
the
chief
of
which
was
a
predominant
anxious
and
even
solemn
impression
that
he
was
now
in
a
great
measure
abandoned
to
his
own
guidance
and
direction
edward
waverley
departed
from
the
hall
amid
the
blessings
and
tears
of
all
the
old
domestics
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
mingled
with
some
sly
petitions
for
sergeantcies
and
corporalships
and
so
forth
on
the
part
of
those
who
professed
that
never
thoft
to
ha
seen
jacob
and
giles
and
jonathan
go
off
for
soldiers
save
to
attend
his
honour
as
in
duty
bound
edward
as
in
duty
bound
extricated
himself
from
the
supplicants
with
the
pledge
of
fewer
promises
than
might
have
been
expected
from
a
young
man
so
little
accustomed
to
the
world
after
a
short
visit
to
london
he
proceeded
on
horseback
then
the
general
mode
of
travelling
to
edinburgh
and
from
thence
to
dundee
a
seaport
on
the
eastern
coast
of
where
his
regiment
was
then
quartered
he
now
entered
upon
a
new
world
where
for
a
time
all
was
beautiful
because
all
was
new
colonel
gardiner
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
was
himself
a
study
for
a
romantic
and
at
the
same
time
an
inquisitive
youth
in
person
he
was
tall
handsome
and
active
though
somewhat
advanced
in
life
in
his
early
years
he
had
been
what
is
called
by
manner
of
palliative
a
very
gay
young
man
and
strange
stories
were
circulated
about
his
sudden
conversion
from
doubt
if
not
infidelity
to
a
serious
and
even
enthusiastic
turn
of
mind
it
was
whispered
that
a
supernatural
communication
of
a
nature
obvious
even
to
the
exterior
senses
had
produced
this
wonderful
change
and
though
some
mentioned
the
proselyte
as
an
enthusiast
none
hinted
at
his
being
a
hypocrite
this
singular
and
mystical
circumstance
gave
colonel
gardiner
a
peculiar
and
solemn
interest
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
soldier
footnote
see
note
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
the
officers
of
a
regiment
commanded
by
so
respectable
a
person
composed
a
society
more
sedate
and
orderly
than
a
military
mess
always
exhibits
and
that
waverley
escaped
some
temptations
to
which
he
might
otherwise
have
been
exposed
meanwhile
his
military
education
proceeded
already
a
good
horseman
he
was
now
initiated
into
the
arts
of
the
manege
which
when
carried
to
perfection
almost
realise
the
fable
of
the
centaur
the
guidance
of
the
horse
appearing
to
proceed
from
the
rider
mere
volition
rather
than
from
the
use
of
any
external
and
apparent
signal
of
motion
he
received
also
instructions
in
his
field
duty
but
i
must
own
that
when
his
first
ardour
was
past
his
progress
fell
short
in
the
latter
particular
of
what
he
wished
and
expected
the
duty
of
an
officer
the
most
imposing
of
all
others
to
the
inexperienced
mind
because
accompanied
with
so
much
outward
pomp
and
circumstance
is
in
its
essence
a
very
dry
and
abstract
task
depending
chiefly
upon
arithmetical
combinations
requiring
much
attention
and
a
cool
and
reasoning
head
to
bring
them
into
action
our
hero
was
liable
to
fits
of
absence
in
which
his
blunders
excited
some
mirth
and
called
down
some
reproof
this
circumstance
impressed
him
with
a
painful
sense
of
inferiority
in
those
qualities
which
appeared
most
to
deserve
and
obtain
regard
in
his
new
profession
he
asked
himself
in
vain
why
his
eye
could
not
judge
of
distance
or
space
so
well
as
those
of
his
companions
why
his
head
was
not
always
successful
in
disentangling
the
various
partial
movements
necessary
to
execute
a
particular
evolution
and
why
his
memory
so
alert
upon
most
occasions
did
not
correctly
retain
technical
phrases
and
minute
points
of
etiquette
or
field
discipline
waverley
was
naturally
modest
and
therefore
did
not
fall
into
the
egregious
mistake
of
supposing
such
minuter
rules
of
military
duty
beneath
his
notice
or
conceiting
himself
to
be
born
a
general
because
he
made
an
indifferent
subaltern
the
truth
was
that
the
vague
and
unsatisfactory
course
of
reading
which
he
had
pursued
working
upon
a
temper
naturally
retired
and
abstracted
had
given
him
that
wavering
and
unsettled
habit
of
mind
which
is
most
averse
to
study
and
riveted
attention
time
in
the
mean
while
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
were
disaffected
and
showed
little
hospitality
to
the
military
guests
and
the
people
of
the
town
chiefly
engaged
in
mercantile
pursuits
were
not
such
as
waverley
chose
to
associate
with
the
arrival
of
summer
and
a
curiosity
to
know
something
more
of
scotland
than
he
could
see
in
a
ride
from
his
quarters
determined
him
to
request
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
weeks
he
resolved
first
to
visit
his
ancient
friend
and
correspondent
with
the
purpose
of
extending
or
shortening
the
time
of
his
residence
according
to
circumstances
he
travelled
of
course
on
and
with
a
single
attendant
and
passed
his
first
night
at
a
miserable
inn
where
the
landlady
had
neither
shoes
nor
stockings
and
the
landlord
who
called
himself
a
gentleman
was
disposed
to
be
rude
to
his
guest
because
he
had
not
bespoke
the
pleasure
of
his
society
to
supper

the
next
day
traversing
an
open
and
uninclosed
country
edward
gradually
approached
the
highlands
of
perthshire
which
at
first
had
appeared
a
blue
outline
in
the
horizon
but
now
swelled
into
huge
gigantic
masses
which
frowned
defiance
over
the

chapter
viii
a
scottish
sixty
years
since
it
was
about
noon
when
captain
waverley
entered
the
straggling
village
or
rather
hamlet
of
close
to
which
was
situated
the
mansion
of
the
proprietor
the
houses
seemed
miserable
in
the
extreme
especially
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
the
smiling
neatness
of
english
cottages
they
stood
without
any
respect
for
regularity
on
each
side
of
a
straggling
kind
of
unpaved
street
where
children
almost
in
a
primitive
state
of
nakedness
lay
sprawling
as
if
to
be
crushed
by
the
hoofs
of
the
first
passing
horse
occasionally
indeed
when
such
a
consummation
seemed
inevitable
a
watchful
old
grandam
with
her
close
cap
distaff
and
spindle
rushed
like
a
sibyl
in
frenzy
out
of
one
of
these
miserable
cells
dashed
into
the
middle
of
the
path
and
snatching
up
her
own
charge
from
among
the
sunburnt
loiterers
saluted
him
with
a
sound
cuff
and
transported
him
back
to
his
dungeon
the
little
varlet
screaming
all
the
while
from
the
very
top
of
his
lungs
a
shrilly
treble
to
the
growling
remonstrances
of
the
enraged
matron
another
part
in
this
concert
was
sustained
by
the
incessant
yelping
of
a
score
of
idle
useless
curs
which
followed
snarling
barking
howling
and
snapping
at
the
horses
heels
a
nuisance
at
that
time
so
common
in
scotland
that
a
french
tourist
who
like
other
travellers
longed
to
find
a
good
and
rational
reason
for
everything
he
saw
has
recorded
as
one
of
the
memorabilia
of
caledonia
that
the
state
maintained
in
each
village
a
relay
of
curs
called
collies
whose
duty
it
was
to
chase
the
chevaux
de
poste
too
starved
and
exhausted
to
move
without
such
a
stimulus
from
one
hamlet
to
another
till
their
annoying
convoy
drove
them
to
the
end
of
their
stage
the
evil
and
remedy
such
as
it
is
still
but
this
is
remote
from
our
present
purpose
and
is
only
thrown
out
for
consideration
of
the
collectors
under
dent
dog
bill
as
waverley
moved
on
here
and
there
an
old
man
bent
as
much
by
toil
as
years
his
eyes
bleared
with
age
and
smoke
tottered
to
the
door
of
his
hut
to
gaze
on
the
dress
of
the
stranger
and
the
form
and
motions
of
the
horses
and
then
assembled
with
his
neighbours
in
a
little
group
at
the
smithy
to
discuss
the
probabilities
of
whence
the
stranger
came
and
where
he
might
be
going
three
or
four
village
girls
returning
from
the
well
or
brook
with
pitchers
and
pails
upon
their
heads
formed
more
pleasing
objects
and
with
their
thin
and
single
petticoats
bare
arms
legs
and
feet
uncovered
heads
and
braided
hair
somewhat
resembled
italian
forms
of
landscape
nor
could
a
lover
of
the
picturesque
have
challenged
either
the
elegance
of
their
costume
or
the
symmetry
of
their
shape
although
to
say
the
truth
a
mere
englishman
in
search
of
the
comfortable
a
word
peculiar
to
his
native
tongue
might
have
wished
the
clothes
less
scanty
the
feet
and
legs
somewhat
protected
from
the
weather
the
head
and
complexion
shrouded
from
the
sun
or
perhaps
might
even
have
thought
the
whole
person
and
dress
considerably
improved
by
a
plentiful
application
of
spring
water
with
a
quantum
sufficit
of
soap
the
whole
scene
was
depressing
for
it
argued
at
the
first
glance
at
least
a
stagnation
of
industry
and
perhaps
of
intellect
even
curiosity
the
busiest
passion
of
the
idle
seemed
of
a
listless
cast
in
the
village
of
the
curs
aforesaid
alone
showed
any
part
of
its
activity
with
the
villagers
it
was
passive
they
stood
and
gazed
at
the
handsome
young
officer
and
his
attendant
but
without
any
of
those
quick
motions
and
eager
looks
that
indicate
the
earnestness
with
which
those
who
live
in
monotonous
ease
at
home
look
out
for
amusement
abroad
yet
the
physiognomy
of
the
people
when
more
closely
examined
was
far
from
exhibiting
the
indifference
of
stupidity
their
features
were
rough
but
remarkably
intelligent
grave
but
the
very
reverse
of
stupid
and
from
among
the
young
women
an
artist
might
have
chosen
more
than
one
model
whose
features
and
form
resembled
those
of
minerva
the
children
also
whose
skins
were
burnt
black
and
whose
hair
was
bleached
white
by
the
influence
of
the
sun
had
a
look
and
manner
of
life
and
interest
it
seemed
upon
the
whole
as
if
poverty
and
indolence
its
too
frequent
companion
were
combining
to
depress
the
natural
genius
and
acquired
information
of
a
hardy
intelligent
and
reflecting
peasantry
some
such
thoughts
crossed
waverley
mind
as
he
paced
his
horse
slowly
through
the
rugged
and
flinty
street
of
interrupted
only
in
his
meditations
by
the
occasional
caprioles
which
his
charger
exhibited
at
the
reiterated
assaults
of
those
canine
cossacks
the
collies
before
mentioned
the
village
was
more
than
half
a
mile
long
the
cottages
being
irregularly
divided
from
each
other
by
gardens
or
yards
as
the
inhabitants
called
them
of
different
sizes
where
for
it
is
sixty
years
since
the
now
universal
potato
was
unknown
but
which
were
stored
with
gigantic
plants
of
kale
or
colewort
encircled
with
groves
of
nettles
and
exhibited
here
and
there
a
huge
hemlock
or
the
national
thistle
overshadowing
a
quarter
of
the
petty
inclosure
the
broken
ground
on
which
the
village
was
built
had
never
been
levelled
so
that
these
inclosures
presented
declivities
of
every
degree
here
rising
like
terraces
there
sinking
like
the
walls
which
fenced
or
seemed
to
fence
for
they
were
sorely
breached
these
hanging
gardens
of
were
intersected
by
a
narrow
lane
leading
to
the
common
field
where
the
joint
labour
of
the
villagers
cultivated
alternate
ridges
and
patches
of
rye
oats
barley
and
pease
each
of
such
minute
extent
that
at
a
little
distance
the
unprofitable
variety
of
the
surface
resembled
a
tailor
book
of
patterns
in
a
few
favoured
instances
there
appeared
behind
the
cottages
a
miserable
wigwam
compiled
of
earth
loose
stones
and
turf
where
the
wealthy
might
perhaps
shelter
a
starved
cow
or
sorely
galled
horse
but
almost
every
hut
was
fenced
in
front
by
a
huge
black
stack
of
turf
on
one
side
of
the
door
while
on
the
other
the
family
dunghill
ascended
in
noble
emulation
about
a
bowshot
from
the
end
of
the
village
appeared
the
inclosures
proudly
denominated
the
parks
of
being
certain
square
fields
surrounded
and
divided
by
stone
walls
five
feet
in
height
in
the
centre
of
the
exterior
barrier
was
the
upper
gate
of
the
avenue
opening
under
an
archway
battlemented
on
the
top
and
adorned
with
two
large
mutilated
masses
of
upright
stone
which
if
the
tradition
of
the
hamlet
could
be
trusted
had
once
represented
at
least
had
been
once
designed
to
represent
two
rampant
bears
the
supporters
of
the
family
of
bradwardine
this
avenue
was
straight
and
of
moderate
length
running
between
a
double
row
of
very
ancient
chestnuts
planted
alternately
with
sycamores
which
rose
to
such
huge
height
and
nourished
so
luxuriantly
that
their
boughs
completely
the
broad
road
beneath
beyond
these
venerable
ranks
and
running
parallel
to
them
were
two
high
walls
of
apparently
the
like
antiquity
overgrown
with
ivy
honeysuckle
and
other
climbing
plants
the
avenue
seemed
very
little
trodden
and
chiefly
by
so
that
being
very
broad
and
enjoying
a
constant
shade
it
was
clothed
with
grass
of
a
deep
and
rich
verdure
excepting
where
a
worn
by
occasional
passengers
tracked
with
a
natural
sweep
the
way
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
gate
this
nether
portal
like
the
former
opened
in
front
of
a
wall
ornamented
with
some
rude
sculpture
with
battlements
on
the
top
over
which
were
seen
by
the
trees
of
the
avenue
the
high
steep
roofs
and
narrow
gables
of
the
mansion
with
lines
indented
into
steps
and
corners
decorated
with
small
turrets
one
of
the
folding
leaves
of
the
lower
gate
was
open
and
as
the
sun
shone
full
into
the
court
behind
a
long
line
of
brilliancy
was
flung
upon
the
aperture
up
the
dark
and
gloomy
avenue
it
was
one
of
those
effects
which
a
painter
loves
to
represent
and
mingled
well
with
the
struggling
light
which
found
its
way
between
the
boughs
of
the
shady
arch
that
vaulted
the
broad
green
alley
the
solitude
and
repose
of
the
whole
scene
seemed
almost
monastic
and
waverley
who
had
given
his
horse
to
his
servant
on
entering
the
first
gate
walked
slowly
down
the
avenue
enjoying
the
grateful
and
cooling
shade
and
so
much
pleased
with
the
placid
ideas
of
rest
and
seclusion
excited
by
this
confined
and
quiet
scene
that
he
forgot
the
misery
and
dirt
of
the
hamlet
he
had
left
behind
him
the
opening
into
the
paved
corresponded
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
the
house
which
seemed
to
consist
of
two
or
three
high
narrow
and
buildings
projecting
from
each
other
at
right
angles
formed
one
side
of
the
inclosure
it
had
been
built
at
a
period
when
castles
were
no
longer
necessary
and
when
the
scottish
architects
had
not
yet
acquired
the
art
of
designing
a
domestic
residence
the
windows
were
numberless
but
very
small
the
roof
had
some
nondescript
kind
of
projections
called
bartizans
and
displayed
at
each
frequent
angle
a
small
turret
rather
resembling
a
box
than
a
gothic
watchtower
neither
did
the
front
indicate
absolute
security
from
danger
there
were
for
musketry
and
iron
stanchions
on
the
lower
windows
probably
to
repel
any
roving
band
of
gypsies
or
resist
a
predatory
visit
from
the
caterans
of
the
neighbouring
highlands
stables
and
other
offices
occupied
another
side
of
the
square
the
former
were
low
vaults
with
narrow
slits
instead
of
windows
resembling
as
groom
observed
a
prison
for
murderers
and
larceners
and
such
like
as
are
tried
at
than
a
place
for
any
christian
cattle
above
these
stables
were
granaries
called
girnels
and
other
offices
to
which
there
was
access
by
outside
stairs
of
heavy
masonry
two
battlemented
walls
one
of
which
faced
the
avenue
and
the
other
divided

court
from

garden

the
inclosure
nor
was
the
court
without
its
ornaments

eked
out

perfectly
clean

everything
around
appeared
solitary
and
would
have
been
silent

for
the
continued
plashing
of
the

the
whole

still
maintained
the
monastic
illusion
which
the

of

had
conjured
up

bore
the
date

no

was
returned

the
peal
resounded
through

was
echoed
from
the

without

startling
the

from

anew

victorious
prince

loudly
through

almost
with

at

may

such
a
garden
which
the
taste
of
the
proprietor
the
author
friend
and
kinsman
sir
alexander
keith
knight
mareschal
has
judiciously
preserved
that
as
well
as

of

are

the
southern
side
of
the
house
clothed
with

having
many
evergreens
trained
upon
its
walls
extended
its
irregular
yet
venerable
front
along
a
terrace
partly
paved
partly
gravelled
partly
bordered
with
flowers
and
choice
shrubs
this
elevation
descended
by
three
several
flights
of
steps
placed
in
its
centre
and
at
the
extremities
into
what
might
be
called
the
garden
proper
and
was
fenced
along
the
top
by
a
stone
parapet
with
a
heavy
balustrade
ornamented
from
space

with
huge
grotesque
figures

seated
upon

middle
of

opening
from

house
and
the
central
flight
of

a
huge
animal
of
the
same
species
supported
on
his
head
and
paws
a
of
large
circumference
inscribed
with
more
diagrams
than
edward
mathematics
enabled
him
to
decipher
the
garden
which
seemed
to
be
kept
with
great
accuracy
abounded
in
and
exhibited
a
profusion
of
flowers
and
evergreens
cut
into
grotesque
forms
it
was
laid
out
in
terraces
which
descended
rank
by
rank
from
the
western
wall
to
a
large
brook
which
had
a
tranquil
and
smooth
appearance
where
it
served
as
a
boundary
to
the
garden
but
near
the
extremity
leapt
in
tumult
over
a
strong
dam
or
the
cause
of
its
temporary
tranquillity
and
there
forming
a
cascade
was
overlooked
by
an
octangular
with
a
gilded
bear
on
the
top
by
way
of
vane
after
this
feat
the
brook
assuming
its
natural
rapid
and
fierce
character
escaped
from
the
eye
down
a
deep
and
wooded
dell
from
the
copse
of
which
arose
a
massive
but
ruinous
tower
the
former
habitation
of
the
barons
of
bradwardine
the
margin
of
the
brook
opposite
to
the
garden
displayed
a
narrow
meadow
or
haugh
as
it
was
called
which
formed
a
small
the
bank
which
retired
behind
it
was
covered
by
ancient
trees

scene
though
pleasing
was
not
quite
equal
to
the
gardens
of
alcina
yet
wanted
not
the
donzellette
garrule
of
that
enchanted
paradise
for
upon
the
green
aforesaid
two
damsels
each
standing
in
a
spacious
tub
performed
with
their
feet
the
office
of
a
patent
these
did
not
however
like
the
maidens
of
armida
remain
to
greet
with
their
harmony
the
approaching
guest
but
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
a
handsome
stranger
on
the
opposite
side
dropped
their
garments
i
should
say
garment
to
be
quite
correct
over
their
limbs
which
their
occupation
exposed
somewhat
too
freely
and
with
a
shrill
exclamation
of
sirs
uttered
with
an
accent
between
modesty
and
coquetry
sprung
off
like
deer
in
different
directions
waverley
began
to
despair
of
gaining
entrance
into
this
solitary
and
seemingly
enchanted
mansion
when
a
man
advanced
up
one
of
the
garden
alleys
where
he
still
retained
his
station
trusting
this
might
be
a
gardener
or
some
domestic
belonging
to
the
house
edward
descended
the
steps
in
order
to
meet
him
but
as
the
figure
approached
and
long
before
he
could
descry
its
features
he
was
struck
with
the
oddity
of
its
appearance
and
gestures
sometimes
this
mister
wight
held
his
hands
clasped
over
his
head
like
an
indian
jogue
in
the
attitude
of
penance
sometimes
he
swung
them
perpendicularly
like
a
pendulum
on
each
side
and
anon
he
slapped
them
swiftly
and
repeatedly
across
his
breast
like
the
substitute
used
by
a
for
his
usual
flogging
exercise
when
his
cattle
are
idle
upon
the
stand
in
a
clear
frosty
day
his
gait
was
as
singular
as
his
gestures
for
at
times
he
hopped
with
great
perseverance
on
the
right
foot
then
exchanged
that
supporter
to
advance
in
the
same
manner
on
the
left
and
then
putting
his
feet
close
together
he
hopped
upon
both
at
once
his
attire
also
was
antiquated
and
extravagant
it
consisted
in
a
sort
of
grey
jerkin
with
scarlet
cuffs
and
slashed
sleeves
showing
a
scarlet
lining
the
other
parts
of
the
dress
corresponded
in
colour
not
forgetting
a
pair
of
scarlet
stockings
and
a
scarlet
bonnet
proudly
surmounted
with
a
turkey
feather
edward
whom
he
did
not
seem
to
observe
now
perceived
confirmation
in
his
features
of
what
the
mien
and
gestures
had
already
announced
it
was
apparently
neither
idiocy
nor
insanity
which
gave
that
wild
unsettled
irregular
expression
to
a
face
which
naturally
was
rather
handsome
but
something
that
resembled
a
compound
of
both
where
the
simplicity
of
the
fool
was
mixed
with
the
extravagance
of
a
crazed
imagination
he
sung
with
great
earnestness
and
not
without
some
taste
a
fragment
of
an
old
scottish
ditty
false
love
and
hast
thou
play
me
this
in
summer
among
the
flowers
i
will
repay
thee
back
again
in
winter
among
the
showers
unless
again
again
my
love
unless
you
turn
again
as
you
with
other
maidens
rove
i
smile
on
other
men
footnote
this
is
a
genuine
ancient
fragment
with
some
alteration
in
the
two
last
lines
here
lifting
up
his
eyes
which
had
hitherto
been
fixed
in
observing
how
his
feet
kept
time
to
the
tune
he
beheld
waverley
and
instantly
doffed
his
cap
with
many
grotesque
signals
of
surprise
respect
and
salutation
edward
though
with
little
hope
of
receiving
an
answer
to
any
constant
question
requested
to
know
whether
bradwardine
were
at
home
or
where
he
could
find
any
of
the
domestics
the
questioned
party
replied
and
like
the
witch
of
thalaba
his
speech
was
song
the
knight
to
the
mountain
his
bugle
to
wind
the
lady
to
greenwood
her
garland
to
bind
the
bower
of
burd
ellen
has
moss
on
the
floor
that
the
step
of
lord
william
be
silent
and
sure
this
conveyed
no
information
and
edward
repeating
his
queries
received
a
rapid
answer
in
which
from
the
haste
and
peculiarity
of
the
dialect
the
word
was
alone
intelligible
waverley
then
requested
to
see
the
butler
upon
which
the
fellow
with
a
knowing
look
and
nod
of
intelligence
made
a
signal
to
edward
to
follow
and
began
to
dance
and
caper
down
the
alley
up
which
he
had
made
his
approaches
a
strange
guide
this
thought
edward
and
not
much
unlike
one
of
shakespeare
roynish
clowns
i
am
not
over
prudent
to
trust
to
his
pilotage
but
wiser
men
have
been
led
by
fools
by
this
time
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
alley
where
turning
short
on
a
little
parterre
of
flowers
shrouded
from
the
east
and
north
by
a
close
yew
hedge
he
found
an
old
man
at
work
without
his
coat
whose
appearance
hovered
between
that
of
an
upper
servant
and
gardener
his
red
nose
and
ruffled
shirt
belonging
to
the
former
profession
his
hale
and
sunburnt
visage
with
his
green
apron
appearing
to
indicate
old
adam
likeness
set
to
dress
this
garden
the
major
domo
for
such
he
was
and
indisputably
the
second
officer
of
state
in
the
barony

as
chief
minister
of
the
interior
superior
even
to
bailie
macwheeble
in
his
own
department
of
the
kitchen
and
cellar
the
major
domo
laid
down
his
spade
slipped
on
his
coat
in
haste
and
with
a
wrathful
look
at
guide
probably
excited
by
his
having
introduced
a
stranger
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
laborious
and
as
he
might
suppose
it
degrading
office
requested
to
know
the
gentleman
commands
being
informed
that
he
wished
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
master
that
his
name
was
waverley
and
so
forth
the
old
countenance
assumed
a
great
deal
of
respectful
importance
could
take
it
upon
his
conscience
to
say
his
honour
would
have
exceeding
pleasure
in
seeing
him

some
refreshment

admitted

seemed
to
confirm

observation
by
twisting
his
features
at

it
may
be
noticed
that
waverley
learned

dedicated
rose

festive
occasion
three
cheers
were
given
by
all
the
sitting
members
of
that
respectable
society
whose
throats
the

had
left
capable
of
such
exertion
nay
i
am
well
assured
that
the
sleeping
partners
of
the
company
snorted
applause
and
that
although
strong
bumpers
and
weak
brains
had
consigned
two
or
three

inarticulate
sounds
intimating

assent

motion
such
unanimous
applause
could
not
be
extorted
but
by
acknowledged
merit
and
rose
bradwardine
not
only
deserved
it
but
also
the
approbation
of
much
more
rational
persons
than
the
bautherwhillery
club
could
have
mustered
even
before
discussion
of
the
first
magnum
she
was
indeed
a
very
pretty
girl
of
the
scotch
cast
of
beauty
that
is
with
a
profusion
of
hair
of
paley
gold
and
a
skin
like
the
snow
of
her
own
mountains
in
whiteness
yet
she
had
not
a
pallid
or
pensive
cast
of
countenance
her
features
as
well
as
her
temper
had
a
lively
expression
her
complexion
though
not
florid
was
so
pure
as
to
seem
transparent
and
the
slightest
emotion
sent
her
whole
blood
at
once
to
her
face
and
neck
her
form
though
under
the
common
size
was
remarkably
elegant
and
her
motions
light
easy
and
unembarrassed
she
came
from
another
part
of
the
garden
to
receive
captain
waverley
with
a
manner
that
hovered
between
bashfulness
and
courtesy
the
first
greetings
past
edward
learned
from
her
that
the
dark
hag
which
had
somewhat
puzzled
him
in
the
butler
account
of
his
master
avocations
had
nothing
to
do
either
with
a
black
cat
or
a
broomstick
but
was
simply
a
portion
of
oak
copse
which
was
to
be
felled
that
day
she
offered
with
diffident
civility
to
show
the
stranger
the
way
to
the
spot
which
it
seems
was
not
far
distant
but
they
were
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
in
person
who
summoned
by
david
gellatley
now
appeared
hospitable
thoughts
intent
clearing
the
ground
at
a
prodigious
rate
with
swift
and
long
strides
which
reminded
waverley
of
the
boots
of
the
nursery
fable
he
was
a
tall
thin
athletic
figure
old
indeed
and
but
with
every
muscle
rendered
as
tough
as
by
constant
exercise
he
was
dressed
carelessly
and
more
like
a
frenchman
than
an
englishman
of
the
period
while
from
his
hard
features
and
perpendicular
rigidity
of
stature
he
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
swiss
officer
of
the
guards
who
had
resided
some
time
at
paris
and
caught
the
costume
but
not
the
ease
or
manner
of
its
inhabitants
the
truth
was
that
his
language
and
habits
were
as
heterogeneous
as
his
external
appearance
owing
to
his
natural
disposition
to
study
or
perhaps
to
a
very
general
scottish
fashion
of
giving
young
men
of
rank
a
legal
education
he
had
been
bred
with
a
view
to
the
bar
but
the
politics
of
his
family
precluding
the
hope
of
his
rising
in
that
profession
bradwardine
travelled
with
high
reputation
for
several
years
and
made
some
campaigns
in
foreign
service
after
his
demele
with
the
law
of
high
treason
in
he
had
lived
in
retirement
conversing
almost
entirely
with
those
of
his
own
principles
in
the
vicinage
the
pedantry
of
the
lawyer
superinduced
upon
the
military
pride
of
the
soldier
might
remind
a
modern
of
the
days
of
the
zealous
volunteer
service
when
the
of
our
pleaders
was
often
flung
over
a
blazing
uniform
to
this
must
be
added
the
prejudices
of
ancient
birth
and
jacobite
politics
greatly
strengthened
by
habits
of
solitary
and
secluded
authority
which
though
exercised
only
within
the
bounds
of
his
estate
was
there
indisputable
and
undisputed
for
as
he
used
to
observe
lands
of
bradwardine
veolan
and
others
had
been
erected
into
a
free
barony
by
a
charter
from
david
the
first
cum

and

et
saka

thol
et
theam
et
et
sive
sive
the
peculiar
meaning
of
all
these
cabalistical
words
few
or
none
could
explain
but
they
implied
upon
the
whole
that
the
baron
of
bradwardine
might
in
case
of
delinquency
imprison
try
and
execute
his
vassals
at
his
pleasure
like
james
the
first
however
the
present
possessor
of
this
authority
was
more
pleased
in
talking
about
prerogative
than
in
exercising
it
and
excepting
that
he
imprisoned
two
poachers
in
the
dungeon
of
the
old
tower
of
where
they
were
sorely
frightened
by
ghosts
and
almost
eaten
by
rats
and
that
he
set
an
old
woman
in
the
jougs
or
scottish
pillory
for
there
were
mair
fules
in
the
laird
ha
house
than
davie
gellatley
i
do
not
learn
that
he
was
accused
of
abusing
his
high
powers
still
however
the
conscious
pride
of
possessing
them
gave
additional
importance
to
his
language
and
deportment
at
his
first
address
to
waverley
it
would
seem
that
the
hearty
pleasure
he
felt
to
behold
the
nephew
of
his
friend
had
somewhat
discomposed
the
stiff
and
upright
dignity
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
demeanour
for
the
tears
stood
in
the
old
gentleman
eyes
when
having
first
shaken
edward
heartily
by
the
hand
in
the
english
fashion
he
embraced
him
a
la
mode
francoise
and
kissed
him
on
both
sides
of
his
face
while
the
hardness
of
his
gripe
and
the
quantity
of
scotch
snuff
which
his
accolade
communicated
called
corresponding
drops
of
moisture
to
the
eyes
of
his
guest
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
he
said
it
makes
me
young
again
to
see
you
here
waverley
a
worthy
scion
of
the
old
stock
of
spes
altera
as
maro
hath
it
and
you
have
the
look
of
the
old
line
captain
waverley
not
so
portly
yet
as
my
old
friend
sir
everard
mais

so
ye

i
could
have

different

so
i
would

deemed

no
more

how

the

tripped
off
demurely
enough
till
she
turned
the
first
corner
and
then
ran
with
the
speed
of
a
fairy
that
she
might
gain
leisure
after
discharging
her
father
commission
to
put
her
own
dress
in
order
and
produce
all
her
little
finery
an
occupation
for
which
the
approaching
left
but
limited
time
can
not
rival
the
luxuries
of
your
english
table
captain
waverley
or
give
you
the

the

is
popular

glad

that

this
speech
with
the
necessary
interjectional
answers
continued
from
the
lower
alley
where
they
met
up
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
four
or
five
servants
in
liveries
headed
by
alexander
saunderson
the
butler
who
now
bore
no
token
of
the
sable
stains
of
the
garden
received
them
in
grand
costume
in
an
old
hall
hung
round
with
pikes
and
with
bows
with
old
bucklers
and
corslets
that
had
borne
many
shrewd
blows
with
much
ceremony
and
still
more
real
kindness
the
baron
without
stopping
in
any
intermediate
apartment
conducted
his
guest
through
several
into
the
great
dining
parlour
wainscotted
with
black
oak
and
hung
round
with
the
pictures
of
his
ancestry
where
a
table
was
set
forth
in
form
for
six
persons
and
an
fashioned
beaufet
displayed
all
the
ancient
and
massive
plate
of
the
bradwardine
family
a
bell
was
now
heard
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
for
an
old
man
who
acted
as
porter
upon
gala
days
had
caught
the
alarm
given
by
waverley
arrival
and
repairing
to
his
post
announced
the
arrival
of
other
guests
these
as
the
baron
assured
his
young
friend
were
very
estimable
persons
was
the
young
laird
of
balmawhapple
a
falconer
by
surname
of
the
house
of
glenfarquhar
given
right
much
to
sports
gaudet
equis
et
canibus
but
a
very
discreet
young
gentleman
then
there
was
the
laird
of
killancureit
who
had
devoted
his
leisure
untill
tillage
and
agriculture
and
boasted
himself
to
be
possessed
of
a
bull
of
matchless
merit
brought
from
the
county
of
devon
the
damnonia
of
the
romans
if
we
can
trust
robert
of
cirencester
he
is
as
ye
may
well
suppose
from
such
a
tendency
but
of
yeoman
extraction
servabit
odorem
testa
diu
and
i
believe
between
ourselves
his
grandsire
was
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
border
one
bullsegg
who
came
hither
as
a
steward
or
bailiff
or
or
something
in
that
department
to
the
last
girnigo
of
killancureit
who
died
of
an
atrophy
after
his
master
death
sir
ye
would
hardly
believe
such
a
scandal
but
this
bullsegg
being
portly
and
comely
of
aspect
intermarried
with
the
lady
dowager
who
was
young
and
amorous
and
possessed
himself
of
the
estate
which
devolved
on
this
unhappy
woman
by
a
settlement
of
her
umwhile
husband
in
direct
contravention
of
an
unrecorded
taillie
and
to
the
prejudice
of
the
disponer
own
flesh
and
blood
in
the
person
of
his
natural
heir
and
seventh
cousin
girnigo
of
tipperhewit
whose
family
was
so
reduced
by
the
ensuing
that
his
representative
is
now
serving
as
a
private
in
the
highland
black
watch
but
this
gentleman
bullsegg
of
killancureit
that
now
is
has
good
blood
in
his
veins
by
the
mother
and
grandmother
who
were
both
of
the
family
of
pickletillim
and
he
is
well
liked
and
looked
upon
and
knows
his
own
place
and
god
forbid
captain
waverley
that
we
of
irreproachable
lineage
should
exult
over
him
when
it
may
be
that
in
the
eighth
ninth
or
tenth
generation
his
progeny
may
rank
in
a
manner
with
the
old
gentry
of
the
country
rank
and
ancestry
sir
should
be
the
last
words
in
the
mouths
of
us
of
unblemished
race
vix

as

saith
there
is
besides
a
clergyman
of
the
true
though
suffering
episcopal
church
of
scotland
footnote
see
note
he
was
a
confessor
in
her
cause
after
the
year
when
a
whiggish
mob
destroyed
his
tore
his
surplice
and
plundered
his
of
four
silver
spoons
intromitting
also
with
his
mart
and
his
mealark
and
with
two
barrels
one
of

one
of

besides
three
bottles
of
brandy
my
and
doer
duncan
macwheeble
is
the
fourth
on
our
list
there
is
a
question
owing
to
the
incertitude
of
ancient
orthography
whether
he
belongs
to
the
clan
of
wheedle
or
of
quibble
but
both
have
produced
persons
eminent
in
the
law
as
such
he
described
them
by
person
and
name
they
enter
and
dinner
was
served
as
they
came
chapter
xi
the
banquet
the
entertainment
was
ample
and
handsome
according
to
the
scotch
ideas
of
the
period
and
the
guests
did
great
honour
to
it
the
baron
eat
like
a
famished
soldier
the
laird
of
balmawhapple
like
a
sportsman
bullsegg
of
killancureit
like
a
farmer
waverley
himself
like
a
traveller
and
bailie
macwheeble
like
all
four
together
though
either
out
of
more
respect
or
in
order
to
preserve
that
proper
declination
of
person
which
showed
a
sense
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
his
patron
he
sat
upon
the
edge
of
his
chair
placed
at
three
feet
distance
from
the
table
and
achieved
a
communication
with
his
plate
by
projecting
his
person
towards
it
in
a
line
which
obliqued
from
the
bottom
of
his
spine
so
that
the
person
who
sat
opposite
to
him
could
only
see
the
foretop
of
his
riding
periwig
this
stooping
position
might
have
been
inconvenient
to
another
person
but
long
habit
made
it
whether
seated
or
walking
perfectly
easy
to
the
worthy
bailie
in
the
latter
posture
it
occasioned
no
doubt
an
unseemly
projection
of
the
person
towards
those
who
happened
to
walk
behind
but
those
being
at
all
times
his
inferiors
for
macwheeble
was
very
scrupulous
in
giving
place
to
all
others
he
cared
very
little
what
inference
of
contempt
or
slight
regard
they
might
derive
from
the
circumstance
hence
when
he
waddled
across
the
court
to
and
from
his
old
grey
pony
he
somewhat
resembled
a
turnspit
walking
upon
its
hind
legs
the
nonjuring
clergyman
was
a
pensive
and
interesting
old
man
with
much
of
the
air
of
a
sufferer
for
conscience
sake
he
was
one
of
those
who
undeprived
their
benefice
forsook
for
this
whim
when
the
baron
was
out
of
hearing
the
bailie
used
sometimes
gently
to
rally
rubrick
upbraiding
him
with
the
nicety
of
his
scruples
indeed
it
must
be
owned
that
he
himself
though
at
heart
a
keen
partisan
of
the
exiled
family
had
kept
pretty
fair
with
all
the
different
turns
of
state
in
his
time
so
that
davie
gellatley
once
described
him
as
a
particularly
good
man
who
had
a
very
quiet
and
peaceful
conscience
that
never
did
him
any
harm
when
the
dinner
was
removed
the
baron
announced
the
health
of
the
king
politely
leaving
to
the
consciences
of
his
guests
to
drink
to
the
sovereign
de
facto
or
de
jure
as
their
politics
inclined
the
conversation
now
became
general
and
shortly
afterwards
miss
bradwardine
who
had
done
the
honours
with
natural
grace
and
simplicity
retired
and
was
soon
followed
by
the
clergyman
among
the
rest
of
the
party
the
wine
which
fully
justified
the
encomiums
of
the
landlord
flowed
freely
round
although
waverley
with
some
difficulty
obtained
the
privilege
of
sometimes
neglecting
the
glass
at
length
as
the
evening
grew
more
late
the
baron
made
a
private
signal
to
saunders
saunderson
or
as
he
facetiously
denominated
him
alexander
ab
alexandro
who
left
the
room
with
a
nod
and
soon
after
returned
his
grave
countenance
mantling
with
a
solemn
and
mysterious
smile
and
placed
before
his
master
a
small
oaken
casket
mounted
with
brass
ornaments
of
curious
form
the
baron
drawing
out
a
private
key
unlocked
the
casket
raised
the
lid
and
produced
a
golden
goblet
of
a
singular
and
antique
appearance
moulded
into
the
shape
of
a
rampant
bear
which
the
owner
regarded
with
a
look
of
mingled
reverence
pride
and
delight
that
irresistibly
reminded
waverley
of
ben
jonson
tom
otter
with
his
bull
horse
and
dog
as
that
wag
wittily
denominated
his
chief
carousing
cups
but
bradwardine
turning
towards
him
with
complacency
requested
him
to
observe
this
curious
relic
of
the
olden
time
represents
he
said
chosen
crest
of
our
family
a
bear
as
ye
observe
and
rampant
because
a
good
herald
will
depict
every
animal
in
its
noblest
posture
as
a
horse
salient
a
greyhound
currant
and
as
may
be
inferred
a
ravenous
animal
in
actu
ferociori
or
in
a
voracious
lacerating
and
devouring
posture
now
sir
we
hold
this
most
honourable
achievement
by
the
or
concession
of
arms
of
frederick
emperor
of
germany
to
my
predecessor
godmund
bradwardine
it
being
the
crest
of
a
gigantic
dane
whom
he
slew
in
the
lists
in
the
holy
land
on
a
quarrel
touching
the
chastity
of
the
spouse
or
daughter
tradition
saith
not
precisely
which
and
thus
as
virgilius
hath
it
mutemus
clypeos
danaumque
insignia
nobis
aptemus
then
for
the
cup
captain
waverley
it
was
wrought
by
the
command
of
saint
duthac
abbot
of
aberbrothock
for
behoof
of
another
baron
of
the
house
of
bradwardine
who
had
valiantly
defended
the
patrimony
of
that
monastery
against
certain
encroaching
nobles
it
is
properly
termed
the
blessed
bear
of
bradwardine
though
old
doctor
doubleit
used
jocosely
to
call
it
ursa
major
and
was
supposed
in
old
and
catholic
times
to
be
invested
with
certain
properties
of
a
mystical
and
supernatural
quality
and
though
i
give
not
in
to
such
anilia
it
is
certain
it
has
always
been
esteemed
a
solemn
standard
cup
and
heirloom
of
our
house
nor
is
it
ever
used
but
upon
seasons
of
high
festival
and
such
i
hold
to
be
the
arrival
of
the
heir
of
sir
everard
under
my
roof
and
i
devote
this
draught
to
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
ancient
and
house
of
waverley
during
this
long
harangue
he
carefully
decanted
a
bottle
of
claret
into
the
goblet
which
held
nearly
an
english
pint
and
at
the
conclusion
delivering
the
bottle
to
the
butler
to
be
held
carefully
in
the
same
angle
with
the
horizon
he
devoutly
quaffed
off
the
contents
of
the
blessed
bear
of
bradwardine
edward
with
horror
and
alarm
beheld
the
animal
making
his
rounds
and
thought
with
great
anxiety
upon
the
appropriate
motto
the
bear
but
at
the
same
time
plainly
foresaw
that
as
none
of
the
guests
scrupled
to
do
him
this
extraordinary
honour
a
refusal
on
his
part
to
pledge
their
courtesy
would
be
extremely
ill
received
resolving
therefore
to
submit
to
this
last
piece
of
tyranny
and
then
to
quit
the
table
if
possible
and
confiding
in
the
strength
of
his
constitution
he
did
justice
to
the
company
in
the
contents
of
the
blessed
bear
and
felt
less
inconvenience
from
the
draught
than
he
could
possibly
have
expected
the
others
whose
time
had
been
more
actively
employed
began
to
show
symptoms
of
innovation
good
wine
did

bring
discredit
on

honest
house
when
there
was

she
seconded

flinging

dexterity
over

combatants

rushed
in

repentance
and
a
reconciliation
waverley
was
unaccustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
excepting
with
great
temperance
he
slept
therefore
soundly
till
late
in
the
succeeding
morning
and
then
awakened
to
a
painful
recollection
of
the
scene
of
the
preceding
evening
he
had
received
a
personal
affront
he
a
gentleman
a
soldier
and
a
waverley
true
the
person
who
offered
it
was
not
at
the
time
it
was
given
possessed
of
the
moderate
share
of
sense
which
nature
had
allotted
him
true
also
in
resenting
this
insult
he
would
break
the
laws
of
heaven
as
well
as
of
his
country
true
in
doing
so
he
might
take
the
life
of
a
young
man
who
perhaps
respectably
discharged
the
social
duties
and
render
his
family
miserable
or
he
might
lose
his
own
no
pleasant
alternative
even
to
the
bravest
when
it
is
debated
coolly
and
in
private
all
this
pressed
on
his
mind
yet
the
original
statement
recurred
with
the
same
irresistible
force
he
had
received
a
personal
insult
he
was
of
the
house
of
waverley
and
he
bore
a
commission
there
was
no
alternative
and
he
descended
to
the
breakfast
parlour
with
the
intention
of
taking
leave
of
the
family
and
writing
to
one
of
his
brother
officers
to
meet
him
at
the
inn
midway
between
and
the
town
where
they
were
quartered
in
order
that
he
might
convey
such
a
message
to
the
laird
of
balmawhapple
as
the
circumstances
seemed
to
demand
he
found
miss
bradwardine
presiding
over
the
tea
and
coffee
the
table
loaded
with
warm
bread
both
of
flour
oatmeal
and
barleymeal
in
the
shape
of
loaves
cakes
biscuits
and
other
varieties
together
with
eggs
reindeer
ham
mutton
and
beef
ditto
smoked
salmon
marmalade
and
all
the
other
delicacies
which
induced
even
johnson
himself
to
extol
the
luxury
of
a
scotch
breakfast
above
that
of
all
other
countries
a
mess
of
oatmeal
porridge
flanked
by
a
silver
jug
which
held
an
equal
mixture
of
cream
and
was
placed
for
the
baron
share
of
this
repast
but
rose
observed
he
had
walked
out
early
in
the
morning
after
giving
orders
that
his
guest
should
not
be
disturbed
waverley
sat
down
almost
in
silence
and
with
an
air
of
absence
and
abstraction
which
could
not
give
miss
bradwardine
a
favourable
opinion
of
his
talents
for
conversation
he
answered
at
random
one
or
two
observations
which
she
ventured
to
make
upon
ordinary
topics
so
that
feeling
herself
almost
repulsed
in
her
efforts
at
entertaining
him
and
secretly
wondering
that
a
scarlet
coat
should
cover
no
better
breeding
she
left
him
to
his
mental
amusement
of
cursing
doctor
doubleit
favourite
constellation
of
ursa
major
as
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
which
had
already
happened
and
was
likely
to
ensue
at
once
he
started
and
his
colour
heightened
as
looking
toward
the
window
he
beheld
the
baron
and
young
balmawhapple
pass
arm
in
arm
apparently
in
deep
conversation
and
he
hastily
asked
falconer
sleep
here
last
night
rose
not
much
pleased
with
the
abruptness
of
the
first
question
which
the
young
stranger
had
addressed
to
her
answered
drily
in
the
negative
and
the
conversation
again
sunk
into
silence
at
this
moment
saunderson
appeared
with
a
message
from
his
master
requesting
to
speak
with
captain
waverley
in
another
apartment
with
a
heart
which
beat
a
little
quicker
not
indeed
from
fear
but
from
uncertainty
and
anxiety
edward
obeyed
the
summons
he
found
the
two
gentlemen
standing
together
an
air
of
complacent
dignity
on
the
brow
of
the
baron
while
something
like
sullenness
or
shame
or
both
blanked
the
bold
visage
of
balmawhapple
the
former
slipped
his
arm
through
that
of
the
latter
and
thus
seeming
to
walk
with
him
while
in
reality
he
led
him
advanced
to
meet
waverley
and
stopping
in
the
midst
of
the
apartment
made
in
great
state
the
following
oration
waverley
my
young
and
esteemed
friend
falconer
of
balmawhapple

craved

my
age
and
experience

of
one
not
wholly
unskilled

the
dependencies
and
punctilios
of
the
duello
or
monomachia

be
his
interlocutor
in
expressing
to
you
the
regret
with
which
he
calls
to
remembrance
certain
passages
of

symposion
last
night
which
could
not
but
be
highly
displeasing
to
you
as
serving
for
the
time
under
this
present
existing
government
he
craves
you
sir
to
drown
in
oblivion
the
memory
of
such
solecisms
against
the
laws
of
politeness
as
being
what
his
better
reason
disavows
and
to
receive
the
hand
which
he
offers
you
in
amity
and
i
must
needs
assure
you
that
nothing
less
than
a
sense
of
being
dans
son
tort
as
a
gallant
french
chevalier
mons
le
bretailleur
once
said
to
me
on
such
an
occasion
and
an
opinion
also
of
your
peculiar
merit
could
have
extorted
such
concessions
for
he
and
all
his
family
are
and
have
been
time
out
of
mind
mavortia
pectora
as
buchanan
saith
a
bold
and
warlike
sept
or
people
edward
immediately
and
with
natural
politeness
accepted
the
hand
which
balmawhapple
or
rather
the
baron
in
his
character
of
mediator
extended
towards
him
was
impossible
he
said
him
to
remember
what
a
gentleman
expressed
his
wish
he
had
not
uttered
and
he
willingly
imputed
what
had
passed
to
the
exuberant
festivity
of
the
day
is
very
handsomely
said
answered
the
baron
undoubtedly
if
a
man
be
ebrius
or
intoxicated
an
incident
which
on
solemn
and
festive
occasions
may
and
will
take
place
in
the
life
of
a
man
of
honour
and
if
the
same
gentleman
being
fresh
and
sober
recants
the
contumelies
which
he
hath
spoken
in
his
liquor
it
must
be
held
vinum
locutum
est
the
words
cease
to
be
his
own
yet
would
i
not
find
this
exculpation
relevant
in
the
case
of
one
who
was
ebriosus
or
an
habitual
drunkard
because
if
such
a
person
choose
to
pass
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
the
predicament
of
intoxication
he
hath
no
title
to
be
exeemed
from
the
obligations
of
the
code
of
politeness
but
should
learn
to
deport
himself
peaceably
and
courteously
when
under
influence
of
the
vinous
stimulus
and
now
let
us
proceed
to
breakfast
and
think
no
more
of
this
daft
business
i
must
confess
whatever
inference
may
be
drawn
from
the
circumstance
that
edward
after
so
satisfactory
an
explanation
did
much
greater
honour
to
the
delicacies
of
miss
than
his
commencement
had
promised
balmawhapple
on
the
contrary
seemed
embarrassed
and
dejected
and
waverley
now
for
the
first
time
observed
that
his
arm
was
in
a
sling
which
seemed
to
account
for
the
awkward
and
embarrassed
manner
with
which
he
had
presented
his
hand
to
a
question
from
miss
bradwardine
he
muttered
in
answer
something
about
his
horse
having
fallen
and
seeming
desirous
to
escape
both
from
the
subject
and
the
company
he
arose
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
made
his
bow
to
the
party
and
declining
the
baron
invitation
to
tarry
till
after
dinner
mounted
his
horse
and
returned
to
his
own
home
waverley
now
announced
his
purpose
of
leaving
early
enough
after
dinner
to
gain
the
stage
at
which
he
meant
to
sleep
but
the
unaffected
and
deep
mortification
with
which
the
natured
and
affectionate
old
gentleman
heard
the
proposal
quite
deprived
him
of
courage
to
persist
in
it
no
sooner
had
he
gained
waverley
consent
to
lengthen
his
visit
for
a
few
days
than
he
laboured
to
remove
the
grounds
upon
which
he
conceived
he
had
meditated
a
more
early
retreat
would
not
have
you
opine
captain
waverley
that
i
am
by
practice
or
precept
an
advocate
of
ebriety
though
it
may
be
that
in
our
festivity
of
last
night
some
of
our
friends
if
not
perchance
altogether
ebrii
or
drunken
were
to
say
the
least
ebrioli
by
which
the
ancients
designed
those
who
were
fuddled
or
as
your
english
vernacular
and
metaphorical
phrase
goes
not
that
i
would
so
insinuate
respecting
you
captain
waverley
who
like
a
prudent
youth
did
rather
abstain
from
potation
nor
can
it
be
truly
said
of
myself
who
having
assisted
at
the
tables
of
many
great
generals
and
marechals
at
their
solemn
carousals
have
the
art
to
carry
my
wine
discreetly
and
did
not
during
the
whole
evening
as
ye
must
have
doubtless
observed
exceed
the
bounds
of
a
modest
hilarity
there
was
no
refusing
assent
to
a
proposition
so
decidedly
laid
down
by
him
who
undoubtedly
was
the
best
judge
although
had
edward
formed
his
opinion
from
his
own
recollections
he
would
have
pronounced
that
the
baron
was
not
only
ebriolus
but
verging
to
become
ebrius
or
in
plain
english
was
incomparably
the
most
drunk
of
the
party
except
perhaps
his
antagonist
the
laird
of
balmawhapple
however
having
received
the
expected
or
rather
the
required
compliment
on
his
sobriety
the
baron
proceeded
sir
though
i
am
myself
of
a
strong
temperament
i
abhor
ebriety
and
detest
those
who
swallow
wine
gulce
causa
for
the
oblectation
of
the
gullet
albeit
i
might
deprecate
the
law
of
pittacus
of
mitylene
who
punished
doubly
a
crime
committed
under
the
influence
of
pater
nor
would
i
utterly
accede
to
the
objurgation
of
the
younger
plinius
in
the
fourteenth
book
of
his
naturalis
no
sir
i
distinguish
i
discriminate
and
approve
of
wine
so
far
only
as
it
maketh
glad
the
face
or
in
the
language
of
flaccus
recepto
amico
thus
terminated
the
apology
which
the
baron
of
bradwardine
thought
it
necessary
to
make
for
the
superabundance
of
his
hospitality
and
it
may
be
easily
believed
that
he
was
neither
interrupted
by
dissent
nor
any
expression
of
incredulity
he
then
invited
his
guest
to
a
morning
ride
and
ordered
that
davie
gellatley
should
meet
them
at
the
dern
path
with
ban
and
buscar
until
the
shooting
season
commence
i
would
willingly
show
you
some
sport
and
we
may
god
willing
meet
with
a
roe
the
roe
captain
waverley
may
be
hunted
at
all
times
alike
for
never
being
in
what
is
called
pride
of
grease
he
is
also
never
out
of
season
though
it
be
a
truth
that
his
venison
is
not
equal
to
that
of
either
the
red
or
fallow
deer

the

therefore

with
david
gellatley
waverley
expressed
his
surprise
that
his
friend
davie
was
capable
of
such
trust
but
the
baron
gave
him
to
understand
that
this
poor
simpleton
was
neither
fatuous
nec
naturaliter
idiota
as
is
expressed
in
the
brieves
of
furiosity
but
simply
a
knave
who
could
execute
very
well
any
commission
which
jumped
with
his
own
humour
and
made
his
folly
a
plea
for
avoiding
every
other
has
made
an
interest
with
us
continued
the
baron
saving
rose
from
a
great
danger
with
his
own
proper
peril
and
the
roguish
loon
must
therefore
eat
of
our
bread
and
drink
of
our
cup
and
do
what
he
can
or
what
he
will
which
if
the
suspicions
of
saunderson
and
the
bailie
are
well
founded
may
perchance
in
his
case
be
commensurate
terms
miss
bradwardine
then
gave
waverley
to
understand
that
this
poor
simpleton
was
dotingly
fond
of
music
deeply
affected
by
that
which
was
melancholy
and
transported
into
extravagant
gaiety
by
light
and
lively
airs
he
had
in
this
respect
a
prodigious
memory
stored
with
miscellaneous
snatches
and
fragments
of
all
tunes
and
songs
which
he
sometimes
applied
with
considerable
address
as
the
vehicles
of
remonstrance
explanation
or
satire
davie
was
much
attached
to
the
few
who
showed
him
kindness
and
both
aware
of
any
slight
or
ill
usage
which
he
happened
to
receive
and
sufficiently
apt
where
he
saw
opportunity
to
revenge
it
the
common
people
who
often
judge
hardly
of
each
other
as
well
as
of
their
betters
although
they
had
expressed
great
compassion
for
the
poor
innocent
while
suffered
to
wander
in
rags
about
the
village
no
sooner
beheld
him
decently
clothed
provided
for
and
even
a
sort
of
favourite
than
they
called
up
all
the
instances
of
sharpness
and
ingenuity
in
action
and
repartee
which
his
annals
afforded
and
charitably
bottomed
thereupon
a
hypothesis
that
david
gellatley
was
no
farther
fool
than
was
necessary
to
avoid
hard
labour
this
opinion
was
not
better
founded
than
that
of
the
negroes
who
from
the
acute
and
mischievous
pranks
of
the
monkeys
suppose
that
they
have
the
gift
of
speech
and
only
suppress
their
powers
of
elocution
to
escape
being
set
to
work
but
the
hypothesis
was
entirely
imaginary
david
gellatley
was
in
good
earnest
the
simpleton
which
he
appeared
and
was
incapable
of
any
constant
and
steady
exertion
he
had
just
so
much
solidity
as
kept
on
the
windy
side
of
insanity
so
much
wild
wit
as
saved
him
from
the
imputation
of
idiocy
some
dexterity
in
in
which
we
have
known
as
great
fools
excel
great
kindness
and
humanity
in
the
treatment
of
animals
entrusted
to
him
warm
affections
a
prodigious
memory
and
an
ear
for
music
the
stamping
of
horses
was
now
heard
in
the
court
and
voice
singing
to
the
two
large
deer
greyhounds
hie
away
hie
away
over
bank
and
over
brae
where
the
copsewood
is
the
greenest
where
the
fountains
glisten
sheenest
where
the
grows
strongest
where
the
morning
dew
lies

where
the
sweetest
sips

where
the
fairy

and

hie

hie

the
verses
he
sings
asked
waverley
to
old
scottish
poetry
miss
bradwardine
believe
not
she
replied
poor
creature
had
a
brother
and
heaven
as
if
to
compensate
to
the
family
deficiencies
had
given
him
what
the
hamlet
thought
uncommon
talents
an
uncle
contrived
to
educate
him
for
the
scottish
kirk
but
he
could
not
get
preferment
because
he
came
from
our
ground
he
returned
from
college
hopeless
and
brokenhearted
and
fell
into
a
decline
my
father
supported
him
till
his
death
which
happened
before
he
was
nineteen
he
played
beautifully
on
the
flute
and
was
supposed
to
have
a
great
turn
for
poetry
he
was
affectionate
and
compassionate
to
his
brother
who
followed
him
like
his
shadow
and
we
think
that
from
him
davie
gathered
many
fragments
of
songs
and
music
unlike
those
of
this
country
but
if
we
ask
him
where
he
got
such
a
fragment
as
he
is
now
singing
he
either
answers
with
wild
and
long
fits
of
laughter
or
else
breaks
into
tears
of
lamentation
but
was
never
heard
to
give
any
explanation
or
to
mention
his
brother
name
since
his
death
said
edward
who
was
readily
interested
by
a
tale
bordering
on
the
romantic
more
might
be
learned
by
more
particular
inquiry
so
answered
rose
my
father
will
not
permit
any
one
to
practise
on
his
feelings
on
this
subject
by
this
time
the
baron
with
the
help
of
saunderson
had
indued
a
pair
of
of
large
dimensions
and
now
invited
our
hero
to
follow
him
as
he
stalked
clattering
down
the
ample
tapping
each
huge
balustrade
as
he
passed
with
the
butt
of
his
massive
and
humming
with
the
air
of

chapter
xiii
a
more
rational
day
than
the
last
the
baron
of
bradwardine
mounted
on
an
active
and
horse
and
seated
on
a
saddle
with
deep
housings
to
agree
with
his
livery
was
no
bad
representative
of
the
old
school
his
embroidered
coat
and
superbly
barred
waistcoat
his
brigadier
wig
surmounted
by
a
small
completed
his
personal
costume
but
he
was
attended
by
two
servants
on
horseback
armed
with
pistols
in
this
guise
he
ambled
forth
over
hill
and
valley
the
admiration
of
every
which
they
passed
in
their
progress
till
down
in
a
grassy
vale
they
found
david
gellatley
leading
two
very
tall
deer
greyhounds
and
presiding
over
half
a
dozen
curs
and
about
as
many
and
boys
who
to
procure
the
chosen
distinction
of
attending
on
the
chase
had
not
failed
to
tickle
his
ears
with
the
dulcet
appellation
of
maister
gellatley
though
probably
all
and
each
had
hooted
him
on
former
occasions
in
the
character
of
daft
davie
but
this
is
no
uncommon
strain
of
flattery
to
persons
in
office
nor
altogether
confined
to
the
barelegged
villagers
of
it
was
in
fashion
sixty
years
since
is
now
and
will
be
six
hundred
years
hence
if
this
admirable
compound
of
folly
and
knavery
called
the
world
shall
be
then
in
existence
these
as
they
were
called
were
destined
to
beat
the
bushes
which
they
performed
with
so
much
success
that
after
half
an
hour
search
a
roe
was
started
coursed
and
killed
the
baron
following
on
his
white
horse
like
earl
percy
of
yore
and
magnanimously
flaying
and
embowelling
the
slain
animal
which
he
observed
was
called
by
the
french
chasseurs
faire
la
curee
with
his
own
baronial
couteau
de
chasse
after
this
ceremony
he
conducted
his
guest
homeward
by
a
pleasant
and
circuitous
route
commanding
an
extensive
prospect
of
different
villages
and
houses
to
each
of
which
bradwardine
attached
some
anecdote
of
history
or
genealogy
told
in
language
whimsical
from
prejudice
and
pedantry
but
often
respectable
for
the
good
sense
and
honourable
feelings
which
his
narrative
displayed
and
almost
always
curious
if
not
valuable
for
the
information
they
contained
the
truth
is
the
ride
seemed
agreeable
to
both
gentlemen
because
they
found
amusement
in
each
other
conversation
although
their
characters
and
habits
of
thinking
were
in
many
respects
totally
opposite
edward
we
have
informed
the
reader
was
warm
in
his
feelings
wild
and
romantic
in
his
ideas
and
in
his
taste
of
reading
with
a
strong
disposition
towards
poetry
mr
bradwardine
was
the
reverse
of
all
this
and
piqued
himself
upon
stalking
through
life
with
the
same
upright
starched
stoical
gravity
which
distinguished
his
evening
promenade
upon
the
terrace
of
where
for
hours
together
the
very
model
of
old
hardyknute
stately
stepp
he
east
the
wa
and
stately
stepp
he
west
as
for
literature
he
read
the
classic
poets
to
be
sure
and
the
of
georgius
buchanan
and
arthur
johnston
psalms
of
a
sunday
and
the
poetarum
scotorum
and
sir
david
lindsay
and
barbour
and
blind
and
gentle
shepherd
and
cherry
and
the
slae
but
though
he
thus
far
sacrificed
his
time
to
the
muses
he
would
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
have
been
much
better
pleased
had
the
pious
or
sapient
apothegms
as
well
as
the
historical
narratives
which
these
various
works
contained
been
presented
to
him
in
the
form
of
simple
prose
and
he
sometimes
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
contempt
of
the
and
unprofitable
art
of
making
in
which
he
said
only
one
who
had
excelled
in
his
time
was
allan
ramsay
the
periwigmaker
footnote
the
baron
ought
to
have
remembered
that
the
joyous
allan
literally
drew
his
blood
from
the
house
of
the
noble
earl
whom
he
terms
dalhousie
of
an
old
descent
my
stoup
my
pride
my
ornament
but
although
edward
and
he
differed
toto
coelo
as
the
baron
would
have
said
upon
this
subject
yet
they
met
upon
history
as
on
a
neutral
ground
in
which
each
claimed
an
interest
the
baron
indeed
only
cumbered
his
memory
with
matters
of
fact
the
cold
dry
hard
outlines
which
history
delineates
edward
on
the
contrary
loved
to
fill
up
and
round
the
sketch
with
the
colouring
of
a
warm
and
vivid
imagination
which
gives
light
and
life
to
the
actors
and
speakers
in
the
drama
of
past
ages
yet
with
tastes
so
opposite
they
contributed
greatly
to
each
other
amusement
bradwardine
minute
narratives
and
powerful
memory
supplied
to
waverley
fresh
subjects
of
the
kind
upon
which
his
fancy
loved
to
labour
and
opened
to
him
a
new
mine
of
incident
and
of
character
and
he
repaid
the
pleasure
thus
communicated
by
an
earnest
attention
valuable
to
all
more
especially
to
the
baron
who
felt
his
habits
of
flattered
by
it
and
sometimes
also
by
reciprocal
communications
which
interested
bradwardine
as
confirming
or
illustrating
his
own
favourite
anecdotes
besides
bradwardine
loved
to
talk
of
the
scenes
of
his
youth
whichl
had
been
spent
in
camps
and
foreign
lands
and
had
many
interesting
particulars
to
tell
of
the
generals
under
whom
he
had
served
and
the
actions
he
had
witnessed
both
parties
returned
to
in
great
with
each
other
waverley
desirous
of
studying
more
attentively
what
he
considered
as
a
singular
and
interesting
character
gifted
with
a
memory
containing
a
curious
register
of
ancient
and
modern
anecdotes
and
bradwardine
disposed
to
regard
edward
as
puer
or
rather
juvenis
bonae
spei
et
magnae
indolis
a
youth
devoid
of
that
petulant
volatility
which
is
impatient
of
or
vilipends
the
conversation
and
advice
of
his
seniors
from
which
he
predicted
great
things
of
his
future
success
and
deportment
in
life
there
was
no
other
guest
except
rubrick
whose
information
and
discourse
as
a
clergyman
and
a
scholar
harmonised
very
well
with
that
of
the
baron
and
his
guest
shortly
after
dinner
the
baron
as
if
to
show
that
his
temperance
was
not
entirely
theoretical
proposed
a
visit
to
apartment
or
as
he
termed
it
her
troisieme
etage
waverley
was
accordingly
conducted
through
one
or
two
of
those
long
awkward
passages
with
which
ancient
architects
studied
to
puzzle
the
inhabitants
of
the
houses
which
they
planned
at
the
end
of
which
bradwardine
began
to
ascend
by
two
steps
at
once
a
very
steep
narrow
and
winding
stair
leaving
rubrick
and
waverley
to
follow
at
more
leisure
while
he
should
announce
their
approach
to
his
daughter
after
having
climbed
this
perpendicular
corkscrew
until
their
brains
were
almost
giddy
they
arrived
in
a
little
matted
lobby
which
served
as
an
anteroom
to
rose
sanctum
sanctorum
and
through
which
they
entered
her
parlour
it
was
a
small
but
pleasant
apartment
opening
to
the
south
and
hung
with
tapestry
adorned
besides
with
two
pictures
one
of
her
mother
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherdess
with
a
the
other
of
the
baron
in
his
tenth
year
in
a
blue
coat
embroidered
waistcoat
laced
hat
and
with
a
bow
in
his
hand
edward
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
costume
and
at
the
odd
resemblance
between
the
round
smooth
staring
visage
in
the
portrait
and
the
gaunt
bearded
swarthy
features
which
travelling
fatigues
of
war
and
advanced
age
had
bestowed
on
the
original
the
baron
joined
in
the
laugh
he
said
picture
was
a
fantasy
of
my
good
mother
a
daughter
of
the
laird
of
tulliellum
captain
waverley
i
indicated
the
house
to
you
when
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
shinnyheuch
it
was
burnt
by
the
dutch
auxiliaries
brought
in
by
the
government
in
i
never
sate
for
my
pourtraicture
but
once
since
that
was
painted
and
it
was
at
the
special
and
reiterated
request
of
the
marechal
duke
of
berwick
the
good
old
gentleman
did
not
mention
what
rubrick
afterwards
told
edward
that
the
duke
had
done
him
this
honour
on
account
of
his
being
the
first
to
mount
the
breach
of
a
fort
in
savoy
during
the
memorable
campaign
of
and
his
having
there
defended
himself
with
his
for
nearly
ten
minutes
before
any
support
reached
him
to
do
the
baron
justice
although
sufficiently
prone
to
dwell
upon
and
even
to
exaggerate
his
family
dignity
and
consequence
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
real
courage
ever
to
allude
to
such
personal
acts
of
merit
as
he
had
himself
manifested
miss
rose
now
appeared
from
the
interior
room
of
her
apartment
to
welcome
her
father
and
his
friends
the
little
labours
in
which
she
had
been
employed
obviously
showed
a
natural
taste
which
required
only
cultivation
her
father
had
taught
her
french
and
italian
and
a
few
of
the
ordinary
authors
in
those
languages
ornamented
her
shelves
he
had
endeavoured
also
to
be
her
preceptor
in
music
but
as
he
began
with
the
more
abstruse
doctrines
of
the
science
and
was
not
perhaps
master
of
them
himself
she
had
made
no
proficiency
farther
than
to
be
able
to
accompany
her
voice
with
the
harpsichord
but
even
this
was
not
very
common
in
scotland
at
that
period
to
make
amends
she
sung
with
great
taste
and
feeling
and
with
a
respect
to
the
sense
of
what
she
uttered
that
might
be
proposed
in
example
to
ladies
of
much
superior
musical
talent
her
natural
good
sense
taught
her
that
if
as
we
are
assured
by
high
authority
music
be
to
immortal
verse
they
are
very
often
divorced
by
the
performer
in
a
most
shameful
manner
it
was
perhaps
owing
to
this
sensibility
to
poetry
and
power
of
combining
its
expression
with
those
of
the
musical
notes
that
her
singing
gave
more
pleasure
to
all
the
unlearned
in
music
and
even
to
many
of
the
learned
than
could
have
been
communicated
by
a
much
finer
voice
and
more
brilliant
execution
unguided
by
the
same
delicacy
of
feeling
a
bartizan
or
projecting
gallery
before
the
windows
of
her
parlour
served
to
illustrate
another
of
rose
pursuits
for
it
was
crowded
with
flowers
of
different
kinds
which
she
had
taken
under
her
special
protection
a
projecting
turret
gave
access
to
this
gothic
balcony
which
commanded
a
most
beautiful
prospect
the
formal
garden
with
its
high
bounding
walls
lay
below
contracted
as
it
seemed
to
a
mere
parterre
while
the
view
extended
beyond
them
down
a
wooded
glen
where
the
small
river
was
sometimes
visible
sometimes
hidden
in
copse
the
eye
might
be
delayed
by
a
desire
to
rest
on
the
rocks
which
here
and
there
rose
from
the
dell
with
massive
or
spiry
fronts
or
it
might
dwell
on
the
noble
though
ruined
tower
which
was
here
beheld
in
all
its
dignity
frowning
from
a
promontory
over
the
river
to
the
left
were
seen
two
or
three
cottages
a
part
of
the
village
the
brow
of
the
hill
concealed
the
others
the
glen
or
dell
was
terminated
by
a
sheet
of
water
called
loch
veolan
into
which
the
brook
discharged
itself
and
which
now
glistened
in
the
western
sun
the
distant
country
seemed
open
and
varied
in
surface
though
not
wooded
and
there
was
nothing
to
interrupt
the
view
until
the
scene
was
bounded
by
a
ridge
of
distant
and
blue
hills
which
formed
the
southern
boundary
of
the
strath
or
valley

this
pleasant
station

some
family
anecdotes
and
tales
of
scottish
chivalry
which
the

told
with
great
enthusiasm
the
projecting
peak
of
an
impending
crag
which
rose
near
it
had
acquired
the
name
of
saint
swithin
chair
it
was
the
scene
of
a
peculiar
superstition
of
which
rubrick
mentioned
some
curious
particulars
which
reminded
waverley
of
a
rhyme
quoted
by
edgar
in
king
lear
and
rose
was
called
upon
to
sing
a
little
legend
in
which
they
had
been
interwoven
by
some
village
poet
who
noteless
as
the
race
from
which
he
sprung
saved
others
names
but
left
his
own
unsung
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
the
simple
beauty
of
her
music
gave
all
the
advantage
which
the
minstrel
could
have
desired
and
which
his
poetry
so
much
wanted
i
almost
doubt
if
it
can
be
read
with
patience
destitute
of
these
advantages
although
i
conjecture
the
following
copy
to
have
been
somewhat
corrected
by
waverley
to
suit
the
taste
of
those
who
might
not

of

divines
were
put
to
the
rout
by
a
sudden

fiend
waverley
looked
as
if
desirous
to
hear
more
i
tell
my
story
as
well
as
sing
my
song
well
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
an
old
woman
called
janet
gellatley
who
was
suspected
to
be
a
witch
on
the
infallible
grounds
that
she
was
very
old
very
ugly
very
poor
and
had
two
sons
one
of
whom
was
a
poet
and
the
other
a
fool
which
visitation
all
the
neighbourhood
agreed
had
come
upon
her
for
the
sin
of
witchcraft
and
she
was
imprisoned
for
a
week
in
the
steeple
of
the
parish
church
and
sparely
supplied
with
food
and
not
permitted
to
sleep
until
she
herself
became
as
much
persuaded
of
her
being
a
witch
as
her
accusers
and
in
this
lucid
and
happy
state
of
mind
was
brought
forth
to
make
a
clean
breast
that
is
to
make
open
confession
of
her
sorceries
before
all
the
whig
gentry
and
ministers
in
the
vicinity
who
were
no
conjurors
themselves
my
father
went
to
see
fair
play
between
the
witch
and
the
clergy
for
the
witch
had
been
born
on
his
estate
and
while
the
witch
was
confessing
that
the
enemy
appeared
and
made
his
addresses
to
her
as
a
handsome
black
man
which
if
you
could
have
seen
poor
old
janet
reflected
little
honour
on
apollyon
taste
and
while
the
auditors
listened
with
astonished
ears
and
the
clerk
recorded
with
a
trembling
hand
she
all
of
a
sudden
changed
the
low
mumbling
tone
with
which
she
spoke
into
a
shrill
yell
and
exclaimed
look
to
yourselves

the
surprise

happy
were
those
who
were
next
the
door
and
many
were
the
disasters
that
befell
hats
bands
cuffs
and
wigs
before
they
could
get
out
of
the
church
where
they
left
the
obstinate
prelatist
to
settle
matters
with
the
witch
and
her
admirer
at
his
own
peril

second

of
chapter

a
discovery
waverley
becomes
domesticated
at
the
next
day
edward
arose
betimes
and
in
a
morning
walk
around
the
house
and
its
vicinity
came
suddenly
upon
a
small
court
in
front
of
the
where
his
friend
davie
was
employed
about
his
charge
one
quick
glance
of
his
eye
recognised
waverley
when
instantly
turning
his
back
as
if
he
had
not
observed
him
he
began
to
sing
part
of
an
old
ballad
young
men
will
love
thee
more
fair
and
more
fast
heard
ye
so
merry
the
little
bird
sing
old
men
love
the
longest
will
last
and
the
head
is
under
his
wing
the
young
man
wrath
is
like
light
straw
on
fire
heard
ye
so
merry
the
little
bird
sing
but
like
steel
is
the
old
man
ire
and
the
head
is
under
his
wing
the
young
man
will
brawl
at
the
evening
board
heard
ye
so
merry
the
little
bird
sing
but
the
old
man
will
draw
at
the
dawning
the
sword
and
the
head
is
under
his
wing
waverley
could
not
avoid
observing
that
davie
laid
something
like
a
satirical
emphasis
on
these
lines
he
therefore
approached
and
endeavoured
by
sundry
queries
to
elicit
from
him
what
the
innuendo
might
mean
but
davie
had
no
mind
to
explain
and
had
wit
enough
to
make
his
folly
cloak
his
knavery
edward
could
collect
nothing
from
him
excepting
that
the
laird
of
balmawhapple
had
gone
home
yesterday
morning
his
boots
fu
o
bluid
in
the
garden
however
he
met
the
old
butler
who
no
longer
attempted
to
conceal
that
having
been
bred
in
the
nursery
line
with
sumack
and
of
newcastle
he
sometimes
wrought
a
turn
in
the
borders
to
oblige
the
laird
and
miss
rose
by
a
series
of
queries
edward
at
length
discovered
with
a
painful
feeling
of
surprise
and
shame
that
balmawhapple
submission
and
apology
had
been
the
consequence
of
a
rencontre
with
the
baron
before
his
guest
had
quitted
his
pillow
in
which
the
younger
combatant
had
been
disarmed
and
wounded
in
the
sword
arm
greatly
mortified
at
this
information
edward
sought
out
his
friendly
host
and
anxiously
expostulated
with
him
upon
the
injustice
he
had
done
him
in
anticipating
his
meeting
with
falconer
a
circumstance
which
considering
his
youth
and
the
profession
of
arms
which
he
had
just
adopted
was
capable
of
being
represented
much
to
his
prejudice
the
baron
justified
himself
at
greater
length
than
i
choose
to
repeat
he
urged
that
the
quarrel
was
common
to
them
and
that
balmawhapple
could
not
by
the
code
of
honour
evite
giving
satisfaction
to
both
which
he
had
done
in
his
case
by
an
honourable
meeting
and
in
that
of
edward
by
such
a
palinode
as
rendered
the
use
of
the
sword
unnecessary
and
which
being
made
and
accepted
must
necessarily
sopite
the
whole
affair
with
this
excuse
or
explanation
waverley
was
silenced
if
not
satisfied
but
he
could
not
help
testifying
some
displeasure
against
the
blessed
bear
which
had
given
rise
to
the
quarrel
nor
refrain
from
hinting
that
the
sanctified
epithet
was
hardly
appropriate
the
baron
observed
he
could
not
deny
that
bear
though
allowed
by
heralds
as
a
most
honourable
ordinary
had
nevertheless
somewhat
fierce
churlish
and
morose
in
his
disposition
as
might
be
read
in
archibald
simson
pastor
of
dalkeith
animalium
and
had
thus
been
the
type
of
many
quarrels
and
dissensions
which
had
occurred
in
the
house
of
bradwardine
of
which
he
continued
might
commemorate
mine
own
unfortunate
dissension
with
my
third
cousin
by
the
side
sir
hew
halbert
who
was
so
unthinking
as
to
deride
my
family
name
as
if
it
had
been
quasi
a
most
uncivil
jest
since
it
not
only
insinuated
that
the
founder
of
our
house
occupied
such
a
mean
situation
as
to
be
a
custodier
of
wild
beasts
a
charge
which
ye
must
have
observed
is
only
entrusted
to
the
very
basest
plebeians
but
moreover
seemed
to
infer
that
our
had
not
been
achieved
by
honourable
actions
in
war
but
bestowed
by
way
of
paranomasia
or
pun
upon
our
family
appellation
a
sort
of
bearing
which
the
french
call
armoires
parlantes
the
latins
arma
cantantia
and
your
english
authorities
canting
heraldry
footnote
see
note
being
indeed
a
species
of
emblazoning
more
befitting
canters
gaberlunzies
and
such
like
mendicants
whose
gibberish
is
formed
upon
playing
upon
the
word
than
the
noble
honourable
and
useful
science
of
heraldry
which
assigns
armorial
bearings
as
the
reward
of
noble
and
generous
actions
and
not
to
tickle
the
ear
with
vain
quodlibets
such
as
are
found
in
jestbooks
of
his
quarrel
with
sir
hew
he
said
nothing
more
than
that
it
was
settled
in
a
fitting
manner
having
been
so
minute
with
respect
to
the
diversions
of
veolan
on
the
first
days
of
edward
arrival
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
its
inmates
to
the
reader
acquaintance
it
becomes
less
necessary
to
trace
the
progress
of
his
intercourse
with
the
same
accuracy
it
is
probable
that
a
young
man
accustomed
to
more
cheerful
society
would
have
tired
of
the
conversation
of
so
violent
an
assertor
of
the
of
heraldry
as
the
baron
but
edward
found
an
agreeable
variety
in
that
of
miss
bradwardine
who
listened
with
eagerness
to
his
remarks
upon
literature
and
showed
great
justness
of
taste
in
her
answers
the
sweetness
of
her
disposition
had
made
her
submit
with
complacency
and
even
pleasure
to
the
course
of
reading
prescribed
by
her
father
although
it
not
only
comprehended
several
heavy
folios
of
history
but
certain
gigantic
tomes
in
polemics
in
heraldry
he
was
fortunately
contented
to
give
her
only
such
a
slight
tincture
as
might
be
acquired
by
perusal
of
the
two
folio
volumes
of
nisbet
rose
was
indeed
the
very
apple
of
her
father
eye
her
constant
liveliness
her
attention
to
all
those
little
observances
most
gratifying
to
those
who
would
never
think
of
exacting
them
her
beauty
in
which
he
recalled
the
features
of
his
beloved
wife
her
unfeigned
piety
and
the
noble
generosity
of
her
disposition
would
have
justified
the
affection
of
the
most
doting
father
his
anxiety
on
her
behalf
did
not
however
seem
to
extend
itself
in
that
quarter
where
according
to
the
general
opinion
it
is
most
efficiently
displayed
in
labouring
namely
to
establish
her
in
life
either
by
a
large
dowry
or
a
wealthy
marriage
by
an
old
settlement
almost
all
the
landed
estates
of
the
baron
went
after
his
death
to
a
distant
relation
and
it
was
supposed
that
miss
bradwardine
would
remain
but
slenderly
provided
for
as
the
good
gentleman
cash
matters
had
been
too
long
under
the
exclusive
charge
of
bailie
macwheeble
to
admit
of
any
great
expectations
from
his
personal
succession
it
is
true
the
said
bailie
loved
his
patron
and
his
patron
daughter
next
though
at
an
incomparable
distance
to
himself
he
thought
it
was
possible
to
set
aside
the
settlement
on
the
male
line
and
had
actually
procured
an
opinion
to
that
effect
and
as
he
boasted
without
a
fee
from
an
eminent
scottish
counsel
under
whose
notice
he
contrived
to
bring
the
point
while
consulting
him
regularly
on
some
other
business
but
the
baron
would
not
listen
to
such
a
proposal
for
an
instant
on
the
contrary
he
used
to
have
a
perverse
pleasure
in
boasting
that
the
barony
of
bradwardine
was
a
male
fief
the
first
charter
having
been
given
at
that
early
period
when
women
were
not
deemed
capable
to
hold
a
feudal
grant
because
according
to
les
coustusmes
de
normandie
ki
se
bast
et
ki
conseille
or
as
is
yet
more
ungallantly
expressed
by
other
authorities
all
of
whose
barbarous
names
he
delighted
to
quote
at
full
length
because
a
woman
could
not
serve
the
superior
or
feudal
lord
in
war
on
account
of
the
decorum
of
her
sex
nor
assist
him
with
advice
because
of
her
limited
intellect
nor
keep
his
counsel
owing
to
the
infirmity
of
her
disposition
he
would
triumphantly
ask
how
it
would
become
a
female
and
that
female
a
bradwardine
to
be
seen
employed
in
servitio
exuendi
seu
detrahendi

post

that
is
in
pulling
off
the
king
boots
after
an
engagement
which
was
the
feudal
service
by
which
he
held
the
barony
of
bradwardine
he
said
hesitation
procul

many
females
as
worthy
as
rose

been
excluded
in

to
make
way
for
my

heaven
forbid
that
i
should
do
aught
that
might
contravene
the
destination
of
my

impinge
upon
the

of

prime
minister
having
received
this
decisive
communication
from
his
sovereign
durst
not
press
his
own
opinion

farther

contented
himself
with
deploring
on
all
suitable
occasions
to
saunderson
the
minister
of
the
interior
the
laird
and
with
laying
plans
for
uniting
rose
with
the
young
laird
of
balmawhapple
who
had
a
fine
estate
only
moderately
burdened
and
was
a
faultless
young
gentleman
being
as
sober
as
a
saint
if
you
keep
brandy
from
him
and
him
from
brandy
and
who
in
brief
had
no
imperfection
but
that
of
keeping
light
company

a
time

as

davie
gellatley
who
happened
to
be
nearer
the
conclave
than
they
were
aware
of
miss
bradwardine
such
as
we
have
described
her
with
all
the
simplicity
and
curiosity
of
a
recluse
attached
herself
to
the
opportunities
of
increasing
her
store
of
literature
which
visit
afforded
her
he
sent
for
some
of
his
books
from
his
quarters
and
they
opened
to
her
sources
of
delight
of
which
she
had
hitherto
had
no
idea
the
best
english
poets
of
every
description
and
other
works
on
made
a
part
of
this
precious
cargo
her
music
even
her
flowers
were
neglected
and
saunders
not
only
mourned
over
but
began
to
mutiny
against
the
labour
for
which
he
now
scarce
received
thanks
these
new
pleasures
became
gradually
enhanced
by
sharing
them
with
one
of
a
kindred
taste
edward
readiness
to
comment
to
recite
to
explain
difficult
passages
rendered
his
assistance
invaluable
and
the
wild
romance
of
his
spirit
delighted
a
character
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
observe
its
deficiencies
upon
subjects
which
interested
him
and
when
quite
at
ease
he
possessed
that
flow
of
natural
and
somewhat
florid
eloquence
which
has
been
supposed
as
powerful
even
as
figure
fashion
fame
or
fortune
in
winning
the
female
heart
there
was
therefore
an
increasing
danger
in
this
constant
intercourse
to
poor
rose
peace
of
mind
which
was
the
more
imminent
as
her
father
was
greatly
too
much
abstracted
in
his
studies
and
wrapped
up
in
his
own
dignity
to
dream
of
his
daughter
incurring
it
the
daughters
of
the
house
of
bradwardine
were
in
his
opinion
like
those
of
the
house
of
bourbon
or
austria
placed
high
above
the
clouds
of
passion
which
might
obfuscate
the
intellects
of
meaner
females
they
moved
in
another
sphere
were
governed
by
other
feelings
and
amenable
to
other
rules
than
those
of
idle
and
fantastic
affection
in
short
he
shut
his
eyes
so
resolutely
to
the
natural
consequences
of
edward
intimacy
with
miss
bradwardine
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
concluded
that
he
had
opened
them
to
the
advantages
of
a
match
between
his
daughter
and
the
wealthy
young
englishman
and
pronounced
him
much
less
a
fool
than
he
had
generally
shown
himself
in
cases
where
his
own
interest
was
concerned
if
the
baron
however
had
really
meditated
such
an
alliance
the
indifference
of
waverley
would
have
been
an
insuperable
bar
to
his
project
our
hero
since
mixing
more
freely
with
the
world
had
learned
to
think
with
great
shame
and
confusion
upon
his
mental
legend
of
saint
cecilia
and
the
vexation
of
these
reflections
was
likely
for
some
time
at
least
to
counterbalance
the
natural
susceptibility
of
his
disposition
besides
rose
bradwardine
beautiful
and
amiable
as
we
have
described
her
had
not
precisely
the
sort
of
beauty
or
merit
which
captivates
a
romantic
imagination
in
early
youth
she
was
too
frank
too
confiding
too
kind
amiable
qualities
undoubtedly
but
destructive
of
the
marvellous
with
which
a
youth
of
imagination
delights
to
dress
the
empress
of
his
affections
was
it
possible
to
bow
to
tremble
and
to
adore
before
the
timid
yet
playful
little
girl
who
now
asked
edward
to
mend
her
pen
now
to
construe
a
stanza
in
tasso
and
now
how
to
spell
a
very
very
long
word
in
her
version
of
it
all
these
incidents
have
their
fascination
on
the
mind
at
a
certain
period
of
life
but
not
when
a
youth
is
entering
it
and
rather
looking
out
for
some
object
whose
affection
may
dignify
him
in
his
own
eyes
than
stooping
to
one
who
looks
up
to
him
for
such
distinction
hence
though
there
can
be
no
rule
in
so
capricious
a
passion
early
love
is
frequently
ambitious
in
choosing
its
object
or
which
comes
to
the
same
selects
her
as
in
the
case
of
saint
cecilia
aforesaid
from
a
situation
that
gives
fair
scope
for
le
beau
ideal
which
the
reality
of
intimate
and
familiar
life
rather
tends
to
limit
and
impair
i
knew
a
very
accomplished
and
sensible
young
man
cured
of
a
violent
passion
for
a
pretty
woman
whose
talents
were
not
equal
to
her
face
and
figure
by
being
permitted
to
bear
her
company
for
a
whole
afternoon
thus
it
is
certain
that
had
edward
enjoyed
such
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
miss
stubbs
aunt
rachel
precaution
would
have
been
unnecessary
for
he
would
as
soon
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
and
although
miss
bradwardine
was
a
very
different
character
it
seems
probable
that
the
very
intimacy
of
their
intercourse
prevented
his
feeling
for
her
other
sentiments
than
those
of
a
brother
for
an
amiable
and
accomplished
sister
while
the
sentiments
of
poor
rose
were
gradually
and
without
her
being
conscious
assuming
a
shade
of
warmer
affection
i
ought
to
have
said
that
edward
when
he
sent
to
dundee
for
the
books
before
mentioned
had
applied
for
and
received
permission
extending
his
leave
of
absence
but
the
letter
of
his
commanding
officer
contained
a
friendly
recommendation
to
him
not
to
spend
his
time
exclusively
with
persons
who
estimable
as
they
might
be
in
a
general
sense
could
not
be
supposed
well
affected
to
a
government
which
they
declined
to
acknowledge
by
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
the
letter
further
insinuated
though
with
great
delicacy
that
although
some
family
connections
might
be
supposed
to
render
it
necessary
for
captain
waverley
to
communicate
with
gentlemen
who
were
in
this
unpleasant
state
of
suspicion
yet
his
father
situation
and
wishes
ought
to
prevent
his
prolonging
those
attentions
into
exclusive
intimacy
and
it
was
intimated
that
while
his
political
principles
were
endangered
by
communicating
with
laymen
of
this
description
he
might
also
receive
erroneous
impressions
in
religion
from
the
prelatic
clergy
who
so
perversely
laboured
to
set
up
the
royal
prerogative
in
things
sacred
this
last
insinuation
probably
induced
waverley
to
set
both
down
to
the
prejudices
of
his
commanding
officer
he
was
sensible
that
bradwardine
had
acted
with
the
most
scrupulous
delicacy
in
never
entering
upon
any
discussion
that
had
the
most
remote
tendency
to
bias
his
mind
in
political
opinions
although
he
was
himself
not
only
a
decided
partisan
of
the
exiled
family
but
had
been
trusted
at
different
times
with
important
commissions
for
their
service
sensible
therefore
that
there
was
no
risk
of
his
being
perverted
from
his
allegiance
edward
felt
as
if
he
should
do
his
uncle
old
friend
injustice
in
removing
from
a
house
where
he
gave
and
received
pleasure
and
amusement
merely
to
gratify
a
prejudiced
and
suspicion
he
therefore
wrote
a
very
general
answer
assuring
his
commanding
officer
that
his
loyalty
was
not
in
the
most
distant
danger
of
contamination
and
continued
an
honoured
guest
and
inmate
of
the
house
of
chapter
xv
a
creagh
and
its
consequences
when
edward
had
been
a
guest
at
nearly
six
weeks
he
descried
one
morning
as
he
took
his
usual
walk
before
the
breakfast
hour
signs
of
uncommon
perturbation
in
the
family
four
with
each
an
empty
in
her
hand
ran
about
with
frantic
gestures
and
uttering
loud
exclamations
of
surprise
grief
and
resentment
from
their
appearance
a
pagan
might
have
conceived
them
a
detachment
of
the
celebrated
belides
just
come
from
their
baling
penance
as
nothing
was
to
be
got
from
this
distracted
chorus
excepting
guide
us
and
sirs
ejaculations
which
threw
no
light
upon
the
cause
of
their
dismay
waverley
repaired
to
the
as
it
was
called
where
he
beheld
bailie
macwheeble
cantering
his
white
pony
down
the
avenue
with
all
the
speed
it
could
muster
he
had
arrived
it
would
seem
upon
a
hasty
summons
and
was
followed
by
half
a
score
of
peasants
from
the
village
who
had
no
great
difficulty
in
keeping
pace
with
him
the
bailie
greatly
too
busy
and
too
important
to
enter
into
explanations
with
edward
summoned
forth
saunderson
who
appeared
with
a
countenance
in
which
dismay
was
mingled
with
solemnity
and
they
immediately
entered
into
close
conference
davie
gellatley
was
also
seen
in
the
group
idle
as
diogenes
at
sinope
while
his
countrymen
were
preparing
for
a
siege
his
spirits
always
rose
with
anything
good
or
bad
which
occasioned
tumult
and
he
continued
frisking
hopping
dancing
and
singing
the
burden
of
an
old
ballad
gear
a
gane
until
happening
to
pass
too
near
the
bailie
he
received
an
admonitory
hint
from
his
which
converted
his
songs
into
lamentation
passing
from
thence
towards
the
garden
waverley
beheld
the
baron
in
person
measuring
and
with
swift
and
tremendous
strides
the
length
of
the
terrace
his
countenance
clouded
with
offended
pride
and
indignation
and
the
whole
of
his
demeanour
such
as
seemed
to
indicate
that
any
inquiry
concerning
the
cause
of
his
discomposure
would
give
pain
at
least
if
not
offence
waverley
therefore
glided
into
the
house
without
addressing
him
and
took
his
way
to
the
where
he
found
his
young
friend
rose
who
though
she
neither
exhibited
the
resentment
of
her
father
the
turbid
importance
of
bailie
macwheeble
nor
the
despair
of
the
handmaidens
seemed
vexed
and
thoughtful
a
single
word
explained
the
mystery
breakfast
will
be
a
disturbed
one
captain
waverley
a
party
of
caterans
have
come
down
upon
us
last
night
and
have
driven
off
all
our
milch
cows
party
of
caterans
robbers
from
the
neighbouring
highlands
we
used
to
be
quite
free
from
them
while
we
paid
blackmail
to
fergus
vich
ian
vohr
but
my
father
thought
it
unworthy
of
his
rank
and
birth
to
pay
it
any
longer
and
so
this
disaster
has
happened
it
is
not
the
value
of
the
cattle
captain
waverley
that
vexes
me
but
my
father
is
so
much
hurt
at
the
affront
and
is
so
bold
and
hot
that
i
fear
he
will
try
to
recover
them
by
the
strong
hand
and
if
he
is
not
hurt
himself
he
will
hurt
some
of
these
wild
people
and
then
there
will
be
no
peace
between
them
and
us
perhaps
for
our
and
we
can
not
defend
ourselves
as
in
old
times
for
the
government
have
taken
all
our
arms
and
my
dear
father
is
so
rash
o
what
will
become
of
us
here
poor
rose
lost
heart
altogether
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
the
baron
entered
at
this
moment
and
rebuked
her
with
more
asperity
than
waverley
had
ever
heard
him
use
to
any
one
it
not
a
shame
he
said
she
should
exhibit
herself
before
any
gentleman
in
such
a
light
as
if
she
shed
tears
for
a
drove
of
horned
nolt
and
milch
kine
like
the
daughter
of
a
cheshire
yeoman
captain
waverley
i
must
request
your
favourable
construction
of
her
grief
which
may
or
ought
to
proceed
solely
from
seeing
her
father
estate
exposed
to
spulzie
and
depredation
from
common
thieves
and
sorners
while
we
are
not
allowed
to
keep
half
a
score
of
muskets
whether
for
defence
or
rescue
bailie
macwheeble
entered
immediately
afterwards
and
by
his
report
of
arms
and
ammunition
confirmed
this
statement
informing
the
baron
in
a
melancholy
voice
that
though
the
people
would
certainly
obey
his
honour
orders
yet
there
was
no
chance
of
their
following
the
gear
to
ony
guid
purpose
in
respect
there
were
only
his
honour
body
servants
who
had
swords
and
pistols
and
the
depredators
were
twelve
highlanders
completely
armed
after
the
manner
of
their
country
having
delivered
this
doleful
annunciation
he
assumed
a
posture
of
silent
dejection
shaking
his
head
slowly
with
the
motion
of
a
pendulum
when
it
is
ceasing
to
vibrate
and
then
remained
stationary
his
body
stooping
at
a
more
acute
angle
than
usual
and
the
latter
part
of
his
person
projecting
in
proportion
the
baron
meanwhile
paced
the
room
in
silent
indignation
and
at
length
fixing
his
eye
upon
an
old
portrait
whose
person
was
clad
in
armour
and
whose
features
glared
grimly
out
of
a
huge
bush
of
hair
part
of
which
descended
from
his
head
to
his
shoulders
and
part
from
his
chin
and
to
his
gentleman
captain
waverley
my
grandsire
he
said
two
hundred
horse
whom
he
levied
within
his
own
bounds
discomfited
and
put
to
the
rout
more
than
five
hundred
of
these
highland
reivers
who
have
been
ever
lapis
offensionis
et
petra
scandali
a
and
a
rock
of
offence
to
the
lowland
vicinage
he
discomfited
them
i
say
when
they
had
the
temerity
to
descend
to
harry
this
country
in
the
time
of
the
civil
dissensions
in
the
year
of
grace
sixteen
hundred
forty
and
two
and
now
sir
i
his
grandson
am
thus
used
at
such
unworthy
hands
here
there
was
an
awful
pause
after
which
all
the
company
as
is
usual
in
cases
of
difficulty
began
to
give
separate
and
inconsistent
counsel
alexander
ab
alexandro
proposed
they
should
send
some
one
to
compound
with
the
caterans
who
would
readily
he
said
give
up
their
prey
for
a
dollar
a
head
the
bailie
opined
that
this
transaction
would
amount
to
or
composition
of
felony
and
he
recommended
that
some
canny
hand
should
be
sent
up
to
the
glens
to
make
the
best
bargain
he
could
as
it
were
for
himself
so
that
the
laird
might
not
be
seen
in
such
a
transaction
edward
proposed
to
send
off
to
the
nearest
garrison
for
a
party
of
soldiers
and
a
magistrate
warrant
and
rose
as
far
as
she
dared
endeavoured
to
insinuate
the
course
of
paying
the
arrears
of
tribute
money
to
fergus
vich
ian
vohr
who
they
all
knew
could
easily
procure
restoration
of
the
cattle
if
he
were
properly
propitiated
none
of
these
proposals
met
the
baron
approbation
the
idea
of
composition
direct
or
implied
was
absolutely
ignominious
that
of
waverley
only
showed
that
he
did
not
understand
the
state
of
the
country
and
of
the
political
parties
which
divided
it
and
standing
matters
as
they
did
with
fergus
vich
ian
vohr
the
baron
would
make
no
concession
to
him
were
it
he
said
procure
restitution
in
integrum
of
every
stirk
and
stot
that
the
chief
his
forefathers
and
his
clan
had
stolen
since
the
days
of
malcolm
canmore
in
fact
his
voice
was
still
for
war
and
he
proposed
to
send
expresses
to
balmawhapple
killancureit
tulliellum
and
other
lairds
who
were
exposed
to
similar
depredations
inviting
them
to
join
in
the
pursuit
then
sir
shall
these
nebulones
nequissimi
as
leslaeus
calls
them
be
brought
to
the
fate
of
their
predecessor
cacus
elisos
oculos
et
siccum
sanguine
guttur
the
bailie
who
by
no
means
relished
these
warlike
counsels
here
pulled
forth
an
immense
watch
of
the
colour
and
nearly
of
the
size
of
a
pewter
and
observed
it
was
now
past
noon
and
that
the
caterans
had
been
seen
in
the
pass
of
ballybrough
soon
after
sunrise
so
that
before
the
allied
forces
could
assemble
they
and
their
prey
would
be
far
beyond
the
reach
of
the
most
active
pursuit
and
sheltered
in
those
pathless
deserts
where
it
was
neither
advisable
to
follow
nor
indeed
possible
to
trace
them
this
proposition
was
undeniable
the
council
therefore
broke
up
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
as
has
occurred
to
councils
of
more
importance
only
it
was
determined
that
the
bailie
should
send
his
own
three
milkcows
down
to
the
mains
for
the
use
of
the
baron
family
and
brew
small
ale
as
a
substitute
for
milk
in
his
own
to
this
arrangement
which
was
suggested
by
saunderson
the
bailie
readily
assented
both
from
habitual
deference
to
the
family
and
an
internal
consciousness
that
his
courtesy
would
in
some
mode
or
other
be
repaid
tenfold
the
baron
having
also
retired
to
give
some
necessary
directions
waverley
seized
the
opportunity
to
ask
whether
this
fergus
with
the
unpronounceable
name
was
the
chief
of
the
district
answered
rose
laughing
is
a
gentleman
of
great
honour
and
consequence
the
chieftain
of
an
independent
branch
of
a
powerful
highland
clan
and
is
much
respected
both
for
his
own
power
and
that
of
his
kith
kin
and
allies
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
thieves
then
is
he
a
magistrate
or
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
asked
waverley
commission
of
war
rather
if
there
be
such
a
thing
said
rose
he
is
a
very
unquiet
neighbour
to
his
unfriends
and
keeps
a
greater
following
on
foot
than
many
that
have
thrice
his
estate
as
to
his
connection
with
the
thieves
that
i
can
not
well
explain
but
the
boldest
of
them
will
never
steal
a
hoof
from
any
one
that
pays
to
vich
lan
vohr
what
is
sort
of
that
gentlemen
and
heritors
lying
near
the
highlands
pay
to
some
highland
chief
that
he
may
neither
do
them
harm
himself
nor
suffer
it
to
be
done
to
them
by
others
and
then
if
your
cattle
are
stolen
you
have
only
to
send
him
word
and
he
will
recover
them
or
it
may
be
he
will
drive
away
cows
from
some
distant
place
where
he
has
a
quarrel
and
give
them
to
you
to
make
up
your
loss

admitted
into
society
and
called
a
gentleman
much
so
said
rose
the
quarrel
between
my
father
and
fergus
began
at
a
county
meeting
where
he
wanted
to
take
precedence
of
all
the
lowland
gentlemen
then
present
only
my
father
would
not
suffer
it
and
then
he
upbraided
my
father
that
he
was
under
his
banner
and
paid
him
tribute
and
my
father
was
in
a
towering
passion
for
bailie
macwheeble
who
manages
such
things
his
own
way
had
contrived
to
keep
this
a
secret
from
him
and
passed
it
in
his
account
for
and
they
would
have
fought
but
fergus
said
very
gallantly
he
would
never
raise
his
hand
against
a
grey
head
that
was
so
much
respected
as
my
o

wish
i
wish
they
had
continued
friends
did
you
ever
see
this
if
that
be
his
name
miss
bradwardine
that
is
not
his
name
and
he
would
consider
master
as
a
sort
of
affront
only
that
you
are
an
englishman
and
know
no
better
but
the
lowlanders
call
him
like
other
gentlemen
by
the
name
of
his
estate
glennaquoich
and
the
highlanders
call
him
vich
ian
vohr
that
is
the
son
of
john
the
great
and
we
upon
the
braes
here
call
him
by
both
names
indifferently
am
afraid
i
shall
never
bring
my
english
tongue
to
call
him
by
either
one
or
other
he
is
a
very
polite
handsome
man
continued
rose
his
sister
flora
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
young
ladies
in
this
country
she
was
bred
in
a
convent
in
france
and
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
before
this
unhappy
dispute
dear
captain
waverley
try
your
influence
with
my
father
to
make
matters
up
i
am
sure
this
is
but
the
beginning
of
our
troubles
for
has
never
been
a
safe
or
quiet
residence
when
we
have
been
at
feud
with
the
highlanders
when
i
was
a
girl
about
ten
there
was
a
skirmish
fought
between
a
party
of
twenty
of
them
and
my
father
and
his
servants
behind
the
mains
and
the
bullets
broke
several
panes
in
the
north
windows
they
were
so
near
three
of
the
highlanders
were
killed
and
they
brought
them
in
wrapped
in
their
plaids
and
laid
them
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
hall
and
next
morning
their
wives
and
daughters
came
clapping
their
hands
and
crying
the
coronach
and
shrieking
and
carried
away
the
dead
bodies
with
the
pipes
playing
before
them
i
could
not
sleep
for
six
weeks
without
starting
and
thinking
i
heard
these
terrible
cries
and
saw
the
bodies
lying
on
the
steps
all
stiff
and
swathed
up
in
their
bloody
tartans
but
since
that
time
there
came
a
party
from
the
garrison
at
stirling
with
a
warrant
from
the
lord
justice
clerk
or
some
such
great
man
and
took
away
all
our
arms
and
now
how
are
we
to
protect
ourselves
if
they
come
down
in
any
strength
waverley
could
not
help
starting
at
a
story
which
bore
so
much
resemblance
to
one
of
his
own
here
was
a
girl
scarce
seventeen
the
gentlest
of
her
sex
both
in
temper
and
appearance
who
had
witnessed
with
her
own
eyes
such
a
scene
as
he
had
used
to
conjure
up
in
his
imagination
as
only
occurring
in
ancient
times
and
spoke
of
it
coolly
as
one
very
likely
to
recur
he
felt
at
once
the
impulse
of
curiosity
and
that
slight
sense
of
danger
which
only
serves
to
heighten
its
interest
he
might
have
said
with
malvolio
i
do
not
now
fool
myself
to
let
imagination
jade
me
i
am
actually
in
the
land
of
military
and
romantic
adventures
and
it
only
remains
to
be
seen
what
will
be
my
own
share
in
them
the
whole
circumstances
now
detailed
concerning
the
state
of
the
country
seemed
equally
novel
and
extraordinary
he
had
indeed
often
heard
of
highland
thieves
but
had
no
idea
of
the
systematic
mode
in
which
their
depredations
were
conducted
and
that
the
practice
was
connived
at
and
even
encouraged
by
many
of
the
highland
chieftains
who
not
only
found
the
creaghs
or
forays
useful
for
the
purpose
of
training
individuals
of
their
clan
to
the
practice
of
arms
but
also
of
maintaining
a
wholesome
terror
among
their
lowland
neighbours
and
levying
as
we
have
seen
a
tribute
from
them
under
colour
of
bailie
macwheeble
who
soon
afterwards
entered
expatiated
still
more
at
length
upon
the
same
topic
this
honest
conversation
was
so
formed
upon
his
professional
practice
that
davie
gellatley
once
said
his
discourse
was
like
a
of
horning
he
assured
our
hero
that
the
maist
ancient
times
of
record
the
lawless
thieves
limmers
and
broken
men
of
the
highlands
had
been
in
fellowship
together
by
reason
of
their
surnames
for
the
committing
of
divers
thefts
reifs
and
herships
upon
the
honest
men
of
the
low
country
when
they
not
only
intromitted
with
their
whole
goods
and
gear
corn
cattle
horse
nolt
sheep
outsight
and
insight
plenishing
at
their
wicked
pleasure
but
moreover
made
prisoners
ransomed
them
or
concussed
them
into
giving
borrows
pledges
to
enter
into
captivity
again
all
which
was
directly
prohibited
in
divers
parts
of
the
statute
book
both
by
the
act
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
and
various
others
the
whilk
statutes
with
all
that
had
followed
and
might
follow
thereupon
were
shamefully
broken
and
vilipended
by
the
said
sorners
limmers
and
broken
men
associated
into
fellowships
for
the
aforesaid
purposes
of
theft
stouthreef
murther
raptus
mulierum
or
forcible
abduction
of
women
and
such
like
as
aforesaid
it
seemed
like
a
dream
to
waverley
that
these
deeds
of
violence
should
be
familiar
to
men
minds
and
currently
talked
of
as
falling
within
the
common
order
of
things
and
happening
daily
in
the
immediate
vicinity
without
his
having
crossed
the
seas
and
while
he
was
yet
in
the
otherwise
island
of
great
britain
chapter
xvi
an
unexpected
ally
appears
the
baron
returned
at
the
and
had
in
a
great
measure
recovered
his
composure
and
he
not
only
confirmed
the
stories
which
edward
had
heard
from
rose
and
bailie
macwheeble
but
added
many
anecdotes
from
his
own
experience
concerning
the
state
of
the
highlands
and
their
inhabitants
the
chiefs
he
pronounced
to
be
in
general
gentlemen
of
great
honour
and
high
pedigree
whose
word
was
accounted
as
a
law
by
all
those
of
their
own
sept
or
clan
did
not
indeed
he
said
them
as
had
occurred
in
late
instances
to
propone
their
prosapia
a
lineage
which
rested
for
the
most
part
on
the
vain
and
fond
rhymes
of
their
seannachies
or
bhairds
as
aequiponderate
with
the
evidence
of
ancient
charters
and
royal
grants
of
antiquity
conferred
upon
distinguished
houses
in
the
low
country
by
divers
scottish
monarchs
nevertheless
such
was
their
outrecuidance
and
presumption
as
to
undervalue
those
who
possessed
such
evidents
as
if
they
held
their
lands
in
a
skin
this
by
the
way
pretty
well
explained
the
cause
of
quarrel
between
the
baron
and
his
highland
ally
but
he
went
on
to
state
so
many
curious
particulars
concerning
the
manners
customs
and
habits
of
this
patriarchal
race
that
edward
curiosity
became
highly
interested
and
he
inquired
whether
it
was
possible
to
make
with
safety
an
excursion
into
the
neighbouring
highlands
whose
dusky
barrier
of
mountains
had
already
excited
his
wish
to
penetrate
beyond
them
the
baron
assured
his
guest
that
nothing
would
be
more
easy
providing
this
quarrel
were
first
made
up
since
he
could
himself
give
him
letters
to
many
of
the
distinguished
chiefs
who
would
receive
him
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
hospitality
while
they
were
on
this
topic
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
ushered
by
saunders
saunderson
a
highlander
fully
armed
and
equipped
entered
the
apartment
had
it
not
been
that
saunders
acted
the
part
of
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
this
martial
apparition
without
appearing
to
deviate
from
his
usual
composure
and
that
neither
bradwardine
nor
rose
exhibited
any
emotion
edward
would
certainly
have
thought
the
intrusion
hostile
as
it
was
he
started
at
the
sight
of
what
he
had
not
yet
happened
to
see
a
mountaineer
in
his
full
national
costume
the
individual
gael
was
a
stout
dark
young
man
of
low
stature
the
ample
folds
of
whose
plaid
added
to
the
appearance
of
strength
which
his
person
exhibited
the
short
kilt
or
petticoat
showed
his
sinewy
and
limbs
the
goatskin
purse
flanked
by
the
usual
defences
a
dirk
and
pistol
hung
before
him
his
bonnet
had
a
short
feather
which
indicated
his
claim
to
be
treated
as
a
or
sort
of
gentleman
a
broadsword
dangled
by
his
side
a
target
hung
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
long
spanish
occupied
one
of
his
hands
with
the
other
hand
he
pulled
off
his
bonnet
and
the
baron
who
well
knew
their
customs
and
the
proper
mode
of
addressing
them
immediately
said
with
an
air
of
dignity
but
without
rising
and
much
as
edward
thought
in
the
manner
of
a
prince
receiving
an
embassy

between
you
and
him
which
has
kept
you
from
seeing
and
considering
the
friendship
and
alliances
that
have
been
between
your
houses
and
forebears
of
old
and
he
prays
you
that
the
cloud
may
pass
away
and
that
things
may
be
as
they
have
been
heretofore
between
the
clan
ivor
and
the
house
of
bradwardine
when
there
was
an
egg
between
them
for
a
flint
and
a
knife
for
a
sword
and
he
expects
you
will
also
say
you
are
sorry
for
the
cloud
and
no
man
shall
hereafter
ask
whether
it
descended
from
the
bill
to
the
valley
or
rose
from
the
valley
to
the
hill
for
they
never
struck
with
the
scabbard
who
did
not
receive
with
the
sword
and
woe
to
him
who
would
lose
his
friend
for
the
stormy
cloud
of
a
spring
morning
to
this
the
baron
of
bradwardine
answered
with
suitable
dignity
that
he
knew
the
chief
of
clan
ivor
to
be
a
to
the
king
and
he
was
sorry
there
should
have
been
a
cloud
between
him
and
any
gentleman
of
such
sound
principles
when
folks
are
banding
together
feeble
is
he
who
hath
no
brother
this
appearing
perfectly
satisfactory
that
the
peace
between
these
august
persons
might
be
duly
solemnised
the
baron
ordered
a
stoup
of
usquebaugh
and
filling
a
glass
drank
to
the
health
and
prosperity
of
of
glennaquoich
upon
which
the
celtic
ambassador
to
requite
his
politeness
turned
down
a
mighty
bumper
of
the
same
generous
liquor
seasoned
with
his
good
wishes
to
the
house
of
bradwardine
having
thus
ratified
the
preliminaries
of
the
general
treaty
of
pacification
the
envoy
retired
to
adjust
with
macwheeble
some
subordinate
articles
with
which
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
trouble
the
baron
these
probably
referred
to
the
discontinuance
of
the
subsidy
and
apparently
the
bailie
found
means
to
satisfy
their
ally
without
suffering
his
master
to
suppose
that
his
dignity
was
compromised
at
least
it
is
certain
that
after
the
plenipotentiaries
had
drunk
a
bottle
of
brandy
in
single
drams
which
seemed
to
have
no
more
effect
upon
such
seasoned
vessels
than
if
it
had
been
poured
upon
the
two
bears
at
the
top
of
the
avenue
evan
dhu
maccombich
having
possessed
himself
of
all
the
information
which
he
could
procure
respecting
the
robbery
of
the
preceding
night
declared
his
intention
to
set
off
immediately
in
pursuit
of
the
cattle
which
he
pronounced
to
be
that
far
off
they
have
broken
the
bone
he
observed
they
have
had
no
time
to
suck
the
marrow
our
hero
who
had
attended
evan
dhu
during
his
perquisitions
was
much
struck
with
the
ingenuity
which
he
displayed
in
collecting
information
and
the
precise
and
pointed
conclusions
which
he
drew
from
it
evan
dhu
on
his
part
was
obviously
flattered
with
the
attention
of
waverley
the
interest
he
seemed
to
take
in
his
inquiries
and
his
curiosity
about
the
customs
and
scenery
of
the
highlands
without
much
ceremony
he
invited
edward
to
accompany
him
on
a
short
walk
of
ten
or
fifteen
miles
into
the
mountains
and
see
the
place
where
the
cattle
were
conveyed
to
adding
it
be
as
i
suppose
you
never
saw
such
a
place
in
your
life
nor
ever
will
unless
you
go
with
me
or
the
like
of
me
our
hero
feeling
his
curiosity
considerably
excited
by
the
idea
of
visiting
the
den
of
a
highland
cacus
took
however
the
precaution
to
inquire
if
his
guide
might
be
trusted
he
was
assured
that
the
invitation
would
on
no
account
have
been
given
had
there
been
the
least
danger
and
that
all
he
had
to
apprehend
was
a
little
fatigue
and
as
evan
proposed
he
should
pass
a
day
at
his
chieftain
house
in
returning
where
he
would
be
sure
of
good
accommodation
and
an
excellent
welcome
there
seemed
nothing
very
formidable
in
the
task
he
undertook
rose
indeed
turned
pale
when
she
heard
of
it
but
her
father
who
loved
the
spirited
curiosity
of
his
young
friend
did
not
attempt
to
damp
it
by
an
alarm
of
danger
which
really
did
not
exist
and
a
knapsack
with
a
few
necessaries
being
bound
on
the
shoulders
of
a
sort
of
deputy
gamekeeper
our
hero
set
forth
with
a
in
his
hand
accompanied
by
his
new
friend
evan
dhu
and
followed
by
the
gamekeeper
aforesaid
and
by
two
wild
highlanders
the
attendants
of
evan
one
of
whom
had
upon
his
shoulder
a
hatchet
at
the
end
of
a
pole
called

and
the
other
a
long
evan
upon
edward
inquiry
gave
him
to
understand
that
this
martial
escort
was
by
no
means
necessary
as
a
guard
but
merely
as
he
said
drawing
up
and
adjusting
his
plaid
with
an
air
of
dignity
that
he
might
appear
decently
at

edward
in
some
surprise
that

with
all
his
usual
followers
when
he
visits
those
of
the
same
rank
there
is
he
continued
stopping
and
drawing
himself
proudly
up
while
he
counted
upon
his
fingers

replied

fair

would
not

where
to
lay
itself
but
for
the
mickle

at

with
similar
tales
of
the
grandeur
of
the
chief
in
peace
and
war
evan
dhu
beguiled
the
way
till
they
approached
more
closely
those
huge
mountains
which
edward
had
hitherto
only
seen
at
a
distance
it
was
towards
evening
as
they
entered
one
of
the
tremendous
passes
which
afford
communication
between
the
high
and
low
country
the
path
which
was
extremely
steep
and
rugged
winded
up
a
chasm
between
two
tremendous
rocks
following
the
passage
which
a
foaming
stream
that
brawled
far
below
appeared
to
have
worn
for
itself
in
the
course
of
ages
a
few
slanting
beams
of
the
sun
which
was
now
setting
reached
the
water
in
its
darksome
bed
and
showed
it
partially
chafed
by
a
hundred
rocks
and
broken
by
a
hundred
falls
the
descent
from
the
path
to
the
stream
was
a
mere
precipice
with
here
and
there
a
projecting
fragment
of
granite
or
a
scathed
tree
which
had
warped
its
twisted
roots
into
the
fissures
of
the
rock
on
the
right
hand
the
mountain
rose
above
the
path
with
almost
equal
inaccessibility
but
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
displayed
a
shroud
of
copsewood
with
which
some
pines
were
intermingled
said
evan
the
pass
of
which
was
kept
in
former
times
by
ten
of
the
clan
donnochie
against
a
hundred
of
the
carles
the
graves
of
the
slain
are
still
to
be
seen
in
that
little
corrie
or
bottom
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
burn
if
your
eyes
are
good
you
may
see
the
green
specks
among
the
heather

is
an

laird

but
i

a

after

he
fired
his
piece
accordingly
but
missed
the
superb
monarch
of
the
feathered
tribes
who
without
noticing
the
attempt
to
annoy
him
continued
his
majestic
flight
to
the
southward
a
thousand
birds
of
prey
hawks
kites
and
ravens
disturbed
from
the
lodgings
which
they
had
just
taken
up
for
the
evening
rose
at
the
report
of
the
gun
and
mingled
their
hoarse
and
discordant
notes
with
the
echoes
which
replied
to
it
and
with
the
roar
of
the
mountain
cataracts
evan
a
little
disconcerted
at
having
missed
his
mark
when
he
meant
to
have
displayed
peculiar
dexterity
covered
his
confusion
by
whistling
part
of
a
pibroch
as
he
reloaded
his
piece
and
proceeded
in
silence
up
the
pass
it
issued
in
a
narrow
glen
between
two
mountains
both
very
lofty
and
covered
with
heath
the
brook
continued
to
be
their
companion
and
they
advanced
up
its
mazes
crossing
them
now
and
then
on
which
occasions
evan
dhu
uniformly
offered
the
assistance
of
his
attendants
to
carry
over
edward
but
our
hero
who
had
been
always
a
tolerable
pedestrian
declined
the
accommodation
and
obviously
rose
in
his
guide
opinion
by
showing
that
he
did
not
fear
wetting
his
feet
indeed
he
was
anxious
so
far
as
he
could
without
affectation
to
remove
the
opinion
which
evan
seemed
to
entertain
of
the
effeminacy
of
the
lowlanders
and
particularly
of
the
english
through
the
gorge
of
this
glen
they
found
access
to
a
black
bog
of
tremendous
extent
full
of
large
which
they
traversed
with
great
difficulty
and
some
danger
by
tracks
which
no
one
but
a
highlander
could
have
followed
the
path
itself
or
rather
the
portion
of
more
solid
ground
on
which
the
travellers
half
walked
half
waded
was
rough
broken
and
in
many
places
quaggy
and
unsound
sometimes
the
ground
was
so
completely
unsafe
that
it
was
necessary
to
spring
from
one
hillock
to
another
the
space
between
being
incapable
of
bearing
the
human
weight
this
was
an
easy
matter
to
the
highlanders
who
wore
brogues
fit
for
the
purpose
and
moved
with
a
peculiar
springing
step
but
edward
began
to
find
the
exercise
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
more
fatiguing
than
he
expected
the
lingering
twilight
served
to
show
them
through
this
serbonian
bog
but
deserted
them
almost
totally
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
and
very
stony
hill
which
it
was
the
travellers
next
toilsome
task
to
ascend
the
night
however
was
pleasant
and
not
dark
and
waverley
calling
up
mental
energy
to
support
personal
fatigue
held
on
his
march
gallantly
though
envying
in
his
heart
his
highland
attendants
who
continued
without
a
symptom
of
abated
vigour
the
rapid
and
swinging
pace
or
rather
trot
which
according
to
his
computation
had
already
brought
them
fifteen
miles
upon
their
journey
after
crossing
this
mountain
and
descending
on
the
other
side
towards
a
thick
wood
evan
dhu
held
some
conference
with
his
highland
attendants
in
consequence
of
which
edward
baggage
was
shifted
from
the
shoulders
of
the
gamekeeper
to
those
of
one
of
the
gillies
and
the
former
was
sent
off
with
the
other
mountaineer
in
a
direction
different
from
that
of
the
three
remaining
travellers
on
asking
the
meaning
of
this
separation
waverley
was
told
that
the
lowlander
must
go
to
a
hamlet
about
three
miles
off
for
the
night
for
unless
it
was
some
very
particular
friend
donald
bean
lean
the
worthy
person
whom
they
supposed
to
be
possessed
of
the
cattle
did
not
much
approve
of
strangers
approaching
his
retreat
this
seemed
reasonable
and
silenced
a
qualm
of
suspicion
which
came
across
edward
mind
when
he
saw
himself
at
such
a
place
and
such
an
hour
deprived
of
his
only
lowland
companion
and
evan
immediately
afterwards
added
indeed
he
himself
had
better
get
forward
and
announce
their
approach
to
donald
bean
lean
as
the
arrival
of
a
sidier
roy
red
soldier
might
otherwise
be
a
disagreeable
surprise
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
in
jockey
phrase
he
trotted
out
and
putting
himself
to
a
very
round
pace
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
waverley
was
now
left
to
his
own
meditations
for
his
attendant
with
the
spoke
very
little
english
they
were
traversing
a
thick
and
as
it
seemed
an
endless
wood
of
pines
and
consequently
the
path
was
altogether
indiscernible
in
the
murky
darkness
which
surrounded
them
the
highlander
however
seemed
to
trace
it
by
instinct
without
the
hesitation
of
a
moment
and
edward
followed
his
footsteps
as
close
as
he
could
after
journeying
a
considerable
time
in
silence
he
could
not
help
asking
it
far
to
the
end
of
their
journey
cove
was
tree
four
mile
but
as
was
a
wee
taiglit
donald
could
tat
is
might
would
should
send
ta
curragh
this
conveyed
no
information
the
curragh
which
was
promised
might
be
a
man
a
horse
a
cart
or
chaise
and
no
more
could
be
got
from
the
man
with
the
but
a
repetition
of
ay
ta
curragh
but
in
a
short
time
edward
began
to
conceive
his
meaning
when
issuing
from
the
wood
he
found
himself
on
the
banks
of
a
large
river
or
lake
where
his
conductor
gave
him
to
understand
they
must
sit
down
for
a
little
while
the
moon
which
now
began
to
rise
showed
obscurely
the
expanse
of
water
which
spread
before
them
and
the
shapeless
and
indistinct
forms
of
mountains
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
surrounded
the
cool
and
yet
mild
air
of
the
summer
night
refreshed
waverley
after
his
rapid
and
toilsome
walk
and
the
perfume
which
it
wafted
from
the
birch
trees
footnote
it
is
not
the
weeping
birch
the
most
common
species
in
the
highlands
but
the
lowland
birch
that
is
distinguished
by
this
fragrance
bathed
in
the
evening
dew
was
exquisitely
fragrant
he
had
now
time
to
give
himself
up
to
the
full
romance
of
his
situation
here
he
sate
on
the
banks
of
an
unknown
lake
under
the
guidance
of
a
wild
native
whose
language
was
unknown
to
him
on
a
visit
to
the
den
of
some
renowned
outlaw
a
second
robin
hood
perhaps
or
adam
o
gordon
and
that
at
deep
midnight
through
scenes
of
difficulty
and
toil
separated
from
his
attendant
left
by
his
guide
what
a
variety
of
incidents
for
the
exercise
of
a
romantic
imagination
and
all
enhanced
by
the
solemn
feeling
of
uncertainty
at
least
if
not
of
danger
the
only
circumstance
which
assorted
ill
with
the
rest
was
the
cause
of
his
journey
the
baron
this
degrading
incident
he
kept
in
the
background
while
wrapt
in
these
dreams
of
imagination
his
companion
gently
touched
him
and
pointing
in
a
direction
nearly
straight
across
the
lake
said
ta
cove
a
small
point
of
light
was
seen
to
twinkle
in
the
direction
in
which
he
pointed
and
gradually
increasing
in
size
and
lustre
seemed
to
flicker
like
a
meteor
upon
the
verge
of
the
horizon
while
edward
watched
this
phenomenon
the
distant
dash
of
oars
was
heard
the
measured
sound
approached
near
and
more
near
and
presently
a
loud
whistle
was
heard
in
the
same
direction
his
friend
with
the
immediately
whistled
clear
and
shrill
in
reply
to
the
signal
and
a
boat
manned
with
four
or
five
highlanders
pushed
for
a
little
inlet
near
which
edward
was
sitting
he
advanced
to
meet
them
with
his
attendant
was
immediately
assisted
into
the
boat
by
the
officious
attention
of
two
stout
mountaineers
and
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
than
they
resumed
their
oars
and
began
to
row
across
the
lake

great
rapidity

by
the

and

chant
of

song
sung
in
a
kind
of
low
recitative
by

by

to
rest
on

surface

the

genius
of
an
oriental
tale
traverses
land
and

they
approached
nearer
and
the
light
of
the
fire
sufficed
to
show
that
it
was
kindled
at
the
bottom
of
a
huge
dark
crag
or
rock
rising
abruptly
from
the
very
edge
of
the
water
its
front
changed
by
the
reflection
to
dusky
red
formed
a
strange
and
even
awful
contrast
to
the
banks
around
which
were
from
time
to
time
faintly
and
partially
illuminated
by
pallid
moonlight
the
boat
now
neared
the
shore
and
edward
could
discover
that
this
large
fire
amply
supplied
with
branches
of
by
two
figures
who
in
the
red
reflection
of
its
light
appeared
like
demons
was
kindled
in
the
jaws
of
a
lofty
cavern
into
which
an
inlet
from
the
lake
seemed
to
advance
and
he
conjectured
which
was
indeed
true
that
the
fire
had
been
lighted
as
a
beacon
to
the
boatmen
on
their
return
they
rowed
right
for
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
then
shifting
their
oars
permitted
the
boat
to
enter
in
obedience
to
the
impulse
which
it
had
received
the
skiff
passed
the
little
point
or
platform
of
rock
on
which
the
fire
was
blazing
and
running
about
two
boats
lengths
farther
stopped
where
the
cavern
for
it
was
already
arched
overhead
ascended
from
the
water
by
five
or
six
broad
ledges
of
rock
so
easy
and
regular
that
they
might
be
termed
natural
steps
at
this
moment
a
quantity
of
water
was
suddenly
flung
upon
the
fire
which
sunk
with
a
hissing
noise
and
with
it
disappeared
the
light
it
had
hitherto
afforded
four
or
five
active
arms
lifted
waverley
out
of
the
boat
placed
him
on
his
feet
and
almost
carried
him
into
the
recesses
of
the
cave
he
made
a
few
paces
in
darkness
guided
in
this
manner
and
advancing
towards
a
hum
of
voices
which
seemed
to
sound
from
the
centre
of
the
rock
at
an
acute
turn
donald
bean
lean
and
his
whole
establishment
were
before
his
eyes
the
interior
of
the
cave
which
here
rose
very
high
was
illuminated
by
torches
made
of
which
emitted
a
bright
and
bickering
light
attended
by
a
strong
though
not
unpleasant
odour
their
light
was
assisted
by
the
red
glare
of
a
large
charcoal
fire
round
which
were
seated
five
or
six
armed
highlanders
while
others
were
indistinctly
seen
couched
on
their
plaids
in
the
more
remote
recesses
of
the
cavern
in
one
large
aperture
which
the
robber
facetiously
called
his
spence
or
pantry
there
hung
by
the
heels
the
carcasses
of
a
sheep
or
ewe
and
two
cows
lately
slaughtered
the
principal
inhabitant
of
this
singular
mansion
attended
by
evan
dhu
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
came
forward
to
meet
his
guest
totally
different
in
appearance
and
manner
from
what
his
imagination
had
anticipated
the
profession
which
he
followed
the
wilderness
in
which
he
dwelt
the
wild
warrior
forms
that
surrounded
him
were
all
calculated
to
inspire
terror
from
such
accompaniments
waverley
prepared
himself
to
meet
a
stern
gigantic
ferocious
figure
such
as
salvator
would
have
chosen
to
be
the
central
object
of
a
group
of
banditti

donald

was
the
very
reverse
of

he
was
thin
in

low
in

with
light
hair
and
small
pale
features
from
which
he
derived
his
agnomen

although
his

was

well

appeared
on

a

insignificant
figure

had
served
in

inferior

in

in

to
receive
his
english
visitor
in
great
form

probably
meaning
in
his

him
a

had
laid
aside
the

for
the
time
to
put
on
an
old
blue

uniform
and
a

in
which
he
was
far
from

to

and
indeed
looked

incongruous

on

bestowed

waverley
who
was
much
puzzled
to
reconcile
their
voracity
with
what
he
had
heard
of
the
abstemiousness
of
the
highlanders
he
was
ignorant
that
this
abstinence
was
with
the
lower
ranks
wholly
compulsory
and
that
like

those
who
practise
it

with

did
not

it

a

bailie
of
perth
from
this
discourse
he
passed
to
the
political
and
military
state
of
the
country
and
waverley
was
astonished
and
even
alarmed
to
find
a
person
of
this
description
so
accurately
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
various
garrisons
and
regiments
quartered
north
of
the
tay
he
even
mentioned
the
exact
number
of
recruits
who
had
joined
waverley
troop
from
his
uncle
estate
and
observed
they
were
pretty
men
meaning
not
handsome
but
stout
warlike
fellows
he
put
waverley
in
mind
of
one
or
two
minute
circumstances
which
had
happened
at
a
general
review
of
the
regiment
which
satisfied
him
that
the
robber
had
been
an
witness
of
it
and
evan
dhu
having
by
this
time
retired
from
the
conversation
and
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
plaid
to
take
some
repose
donald
asked
edward
in
a
very
significant
manner
whether
he
had
nothing
particular
to
say
to
him
waverley
surprised
and
somewhat
startled
at
this
question
from
such
a
character
answered
he
had
no
motive
in
visiting
him
but
curiosity
to
see
his
extraordinary
place
of
residence
donald
bean
lean
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
for
an
instant
and
then
said
with
a
significant
nod
might
as
well
have
confided
in
me
i
am
as
much
worthy
of
trust
as
either
the
baron
of
bradwardine
or
vich
ian
vohr
but
you
are
equally
welcome
to
my
house
waverley
felt
an
involuntary
shudder
creep
over
him
at
the
mysterious
language
held
by
this
outlawed
and
lawless
bandit
which
in
despite
of
his
attempts
to
master
it
deprived
him
of
the
power
to
ask
the
meaning
of
his
insinuations
a
heath
pallet
with
the
flowers
stuck
uppermost
had
been
prepared
for
him
in
a
recess
of
the
cave
and
here
covered
with
such
spare
plaids
as
could
be
mustered
he
lay
for
some
time
watching
the
motions
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
cavern
small
parties
of
two
or
three
entered
or
left
the
place
without
any
other
ceremony
than
a
few
words
in
gaelic
to
the
principal
outlaw
and
when
he
fell
asleep
to
a
tall
highlander
who
acted
as
his
lieutenant
and
seemed
to
keep
watch
during
his
repose
those
who
entered
seemed
to
have
returned
from
some
excursion
of
which
they
reported
the
success
and
went
without
farther
ceremony
to
the
larder
where
cutting
with
their
dirks
their
rations
from
the
carcasses
which
were
there
suspended
they
proceeded
to
broil
and
eat
them
at
their
own
pleasure
and
leisure
the
liquor
was
under
strict
regulation
being
served
out
either
by
donald
himself
his
lieutenant
or
the
strapping
highland
girl
aforesaid
who
was
the
only
female
that
appeared
the
allowance
of
whisky
however
would
have
appeared
prodigal
to
any
but
highlanders
who
living
entirely
in
the
open
air
and
in
a
very
moist
climate
can
consume
great
quantities
of
ardent
spirits
without
the
usual
baneful
effects
either
upon
the
brain
or
constitution
at
length
the
fluctuating
groups
began
to
swim
before
the
eyes
of
our
hero
as
they
gradually
closed
nor
did
he
them
till
the
morning
sun
was
high
on
the

there
was
but
a

and
glimmering

xviii
waverley
proceeds
on
his
journey
when
edward
had
collected
his
scattered
recollection
he
was
surprised
to
observe
the
cavern
totally
deserted
having
arisen
and
put
his
dress
in
some
order
he
looked
more
accurately
round
him
but
all
was
still
solitary
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
decayed
brands
of
the
fire
now
sunk
into
grey
ashes
and
the
remnants
of
the
festival
consisting
of
bones
half
burnt
and
half
gnawed
and
an
empty
keg
or
two
there
remained
no
traces
of
donald
and
his
band
when
waverley
sallied
forth
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
he
perceived
that
the
point
of
rock
on
which
remained
the
marks
of
last
night
beacon
was
accessible
by
a
small
path
either
natural
or
roughly
hewn
in
the
rock
along
the
little
inlet
of
water
which
ran
a
few
yards
up
into
the
cavern
where
as
in
a
wetdock
the
skiff
which
brought
him
there
the
night
before
was
still
lying
moored
when
he
reached
the
small
projecting
platform
on
which
the
beacon
had
been
established
he
would
have
believed
his
further
progress
by
land
impossible
only
that
it
was
scarce
probable
but
what
the
inhabitants
of
the
cavern
had
some
mode
of
issuing
from
it
otherwise
than
by
the
lake
accordingly
he
soon
observed
three
or
four
shelving
steps
or
ledges
of
rock
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
little
platform
and
making
use
of
them
as
a
staircase
he
clambered
by
their
means
around
the
projecting
shoulder
of
the
crag
on
which
the
cavern
opened
and
descending
with
some
difficulty
on
the
other
side
he
gained
the
wild
and
precipitous
shores
of
a
highland
loch
about
four
miles
in
length
and
a
mile
and
a
half
across
surrounded
by
heathy
and
savage
mountains
on
the
crests
of
which
the
morning
mist
was
still
sleeping
looking
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
came
he
could
not
help
admiring
the
address
which
had
adopted
a
retreat
of
such
seclusion
and
secrecy
the
rock
round
the
shoulder
of
which
he
had
turned
by
a
few
imperceptible
notches
that
barely
afforded
place
for
the
foot
seemed
in
looking
back
upon
it
a
huge
precipice
which
barred
all
further
passage
by
the
shores
of
the
lake
in
that
direction
there
could
be
no
possibility
the
breadth
of
the
lake
considered
of
descrying
the
entrance
of
the
narrow
and
cave
from
the
other
side
so
that
unless
the
retreat
had
been
sought
for
with
boats
or
disclosed
by
treachery
it
might
be
a
safe
and
secret
residence
to
its
garrison
as
long
as
they
were
supplied
with
provisions
having
satisfied
his
curiosity
in
these
particulars
waverley
looked
around
for
evan
dhu
and
his
attendants
who
he
rightly
judged
would
be
at
no
great
distance
whatever
might
have
become
of
donald
bean
lean
and
his
party
whose
mode
of
life
was
of
course
liable
to
sudden
migrations
of
abode
accordingly
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
he
beheld
a
highlander
evan
apparently
angling
in
the
lake
with
another
attending
him
whom
from
the
weapon
which
he
shouldered
he
recognised
for
his
friend
with
the
much
nearer
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
heard
the
notes
of
a
lively
gaelic
song
guided
by
which
in
a
sunny
recess
shaded
by
a
glittering
and
carpeted
with
a
bank
of
firm
white
sand
he
found
the
damsel
of
the
cavern
whose
lay
had
already
reached
him
busy
to
the
best
of
her
power
in
arranging
to
advantage
a
morning
repast
of
milk
eggs
fresh
butter
and
the
poor
girl
had
already
made
a
circuit
of
four
miles
that
morning
in
search
of
the
eggs
of
the
meal
which
baked
her
cakes
and
of
the
other
materials
of
the
breakfast
being
all
delicacies
which
she
had
to
beg
or
borrow
from
distant
cottagers
the
followers
of
donald
bean
lean
used
little
food
except
the
flesh
of
the
animals
which
they
drove
away
from
the
lowlands
bread
itself
was
a
delicacy
seldom
thought
of
because
hard
to
be
obtained
and
all
the
domestic
accommodations
of
milk
poultry
butter
were
out
of
the
question
in
this
scythian
camp
yet
it
must
not
be
omitted
that
although
alice
had
occupied
a
part
of
the
morning
in
providing
those
accommodations
for
her
guest
which
the
cavern
did
not
afford
she
had
secured
time
also
to
arrange
her
own
person
in
her
best
trim
her
finery
was
very
simple
a
short
jacket
and
a
petticoat
of
scanty
longitude
was
her
whole
dress
but
these
were
clean
and
neatly
arranged
a
piece
of
scarlet
embroidered
cloth
called
the
snood
confined
her
hair
which
fell
over
it
in
a
profusion
of
rich
dark
curls
the
scarlet
plaid
which
formed
part
of
her
dress
was
laid
aside
that
it
might
not
impede
her
activity
in
attending
the
stranger
i
should
forget
alice
proudest
ornament
were
i
to
omit
mentioning
a
pair
of
gold
and
a
golden
rosary
which
her
father
for
she
was
the
daughter
of
donald
bean
lean
had
brought
from
france
the
plunder
probably
of
some
battle
or
storm
her
form
though
rather
large
for
her
years
was
very
well
proportioned
and
her
demeanour
had
a
natural
and
rustic
grace
with
nothing
of
the
sheepishness
of
an
ordinary
peasant
the
smiles
displaying
a
row
of
teeth
of
exquisite
whiteness
and
the
laughing
eyes
with
which
in
dumb
show
she
gave
waverley
that
morning
greeting
which
she
wanted
english
words
to
express
might
have
been
interpreted
by
a
coxcomb
or
perhaps
by
a
young
soldier
who
without
being
such
was
conscious
of
a
handsome
person
as
meant
to
convey
more
than
the
courtesy
of
an
hostess
nor
do
i
take
it
upon
me
to
say
that
the
little
wild
mountaineer
would
have
welcomed
any
staid
old
gentleman
advanced
in
life
the
baron
of
bradwardine
for
example
with
the
cheerful
pains
which
she
bestowed
upon
edward
accommodation
she
seemed
eager
to
place
him
by
the
meal
which
she
had
so
sedulously
arranged
and
to
which
she
now
added
a
few
bunches
of
cranberries
gathered
in
an
adjacent
morass
having
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
seated
at
his
breakfast
she
placed
herself
demurely
upon
a
stone
at
a
few
yards
distance
and
appeared
to
watch
with
great
complacency
for
some
opportunity
of
serving
him
evan
and
his
attendant
now
returned
slowly
along
the
beach
the
latter
bearing
a
large
the
produce
of
the
sport
together
with
the
while
evan
strolled
forward
with
an
easy
and
important
gait
towards
the
spot
where
waverley
was
so
agreeably
employed
at
the
after
morning
greetings
had
passed
on
both
sides
and
evan
looking
at
waverley
had
said
something
in
gaelic
to
alice
which
made
her
laugh
yet
colour
up
to
her
eyes
through
a
complexion
well
by
sun
and
wind
evan
intimated
his
commands
that
the
fish
should
be
prepared
for
breakfast
a
spark
from
the
lock
of
his
pistol
produced
a
light
and
a
few
withered
fir
branches
were
quickly
in
flame
and
as
speedily
reduced
to
hot
embers
on
which
the
trout
was
broiled
in
large
slices
to
crown
the
repast
evan
produced
from
the
pocket
of
his
short
jerkin
a
large
scallop
shell
and
from
under
the
folds
of
his
plaid
a
ram
horn
full
of
whisky
of
this
he
took
a
copious
dram
observing
he
had
already
taken
his
morning
with
donald
bean
lean
before
his
departure
he
offered
the
same
cordial
to
alice
and
to
edward
which
they
both
declined
with
the
bounteous
air
of
a
lord
evan
then
proffered
the
scallop
to
dugald
mahony
his
attendant
who
without
waiting
to
be
asked
a
second
time
drank
it
off
with
great
gusto
evan
then
prepared
to
move
towards
the
boat
inviting
waverley
to
attend
him
meanwhile
alice
had
made
up
in
a
small
basket
what
she
thought
worth
removing
and
flinging
her
plaid
around
her
she
advanced
up
to
edward
and
with
the
utmost
simplicity
taking
hold
of
his
hand
offered
her
cheek
to
his
salute
dropping
at
the
same
time
her
little
curtsy
evan
who
was
esteemed
a
wag
among
the
mountain
fair
advanced
as
if
to
secure
a
similar
favour
but
alice
snatching
up
her
basket
escaped
up
the
rocky
bank
as
fleetly
as
a
roe
and
turning
round
and
laughing
called
something
out
to
him
in
gaelic
which
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
and
language
then
waving
her
hand
to
edward
she
resumed
her
road
and
was
soon
lost
among
the
thickets
though
they
continued
for
some
time
to
hear
her
lively
carol
as
she
proceeded
gaily
on
her
solitary
journey
they
now
again
entered
the
gorge
of
the
cavern
and
stepping
into
the
boat
the
highlander
pushed
off
and
taking
advantage
of
the
morning
breeze
hoisted
a
clumsy
sort
of
sail
while
evan
assumed
the
helm
directing
their
course
as
it
appeared
to
waverley
rather
higher
up
the
lake
than
towards
the
place
of
his
embarkation
on
the
preceding
night
as
they
glided
along
the
silver
mirror
evan
opened
the
conversation
with
a
panegyric
upon
alice
who
he
said
was
both
canny
and
fendy
and
was
to
the
boot
of
all
that
the
best
dancer
of
a
strathspey
in
the
whole
strath
edward
assented
to
her
praises
so
far
as
he
understood
them
yet
could
not
help
regretting
that
she
was
condemned
to
such
a
perilous
and
dismal
life
for
that
said
evan
is
nothing
in
perthshire
that
she
need
want
if
she
ask
her
father
to
fetch
it

drew

creek
among

and
reeds
where
it
lay
perfectly
concealed
the

they
put

for

when

bring
him
to

place
the
travellers
followed
for
some
time
a
delightful
opening
into
the

down
which
a
little
brook
found
its
way
to
the
lake
when
they
had
pursued
their

waverley
renewed
his
questions
about

always
reside
in

cave
no
it
past
the
skill
of

to
tell

to
be

at
a
times
there
not
a

nook

or

others
beside
your

shelter
him
master
my

answered
evan
haughtily
and
then
immediately
assuming
his
usual
civility
of
manner
you

my
chief
no
he
does
not
shelter
donald
bean
lean
nor
any
that
are

him
he
only
allows
him
with
a

wood
and
water
great
boon
i
should
think
evan
when
both
seem
to
be
very
plenty
but
ye
dinna
see
through
it
when
i
say
wood
and
water
i
mean
the
loch
and
the
land
and
i
fancy
donald
would
be
put
till
if
the
laird
were
to
look
for
him
wi
threescore
men
in

wood
of

suppose
a

came

would
not
your
chief
defend
him
he
would
not
ware
the

must
donald

fall
back
it

upon

if

quoth
evan
beyond
all

indeed
to
tell
you
the
truth
there
durst
not

ye

dhu
because
they
wear
the
tartans
as
they
call
your

king
george

sidier
roy
or
red

but
when
you
were
in

evan
you
were
surely
king
george
soldiers

you
must
ask
vich
ian

about

this

i
can
not

been
misguggled
by
ane
of

he
had
been
closed
in
a
glazed
chamber
and
a
bed
with
curtains
and
fed
with
red
wine

and
donald
was
sae
vexed
about
it
that
when
he
was
stout
and
weel
he
even
sent
him
free
home
and
said
he
would
be
pleased
with
onything
they
would
like
to
gie
him
for
the
plague
and
trouble
which
he
had
about
gilliewhackit
to
an
unkenn
degree
and
i
can
not
tell
you
precisely
how
they
sorted
but
they
agreed
sae
right
that
donald
was
invited
to
dance
at
the
wedding
in
his
highland
trews
and
they
said
that
there
was
never

clinked
in

the
evidence
what
it
liked
if
he
had
the
luck
to
be
on
donald
inquest
he
would
bring
him
in
guilty

nothing

and
disjointed

state

perhaps
to
the
amusement
of

that
of
our

at
length
after
having
marched
over
bank

brae
moss
and

edward
though
not
unacquainted
with
the
scottish
liberality
in
computing
distance
began
to
think
that
evan
five
miles
were
nearly
doubled
his
observation
on
the
large
measure
which
the
scottish
allowed
of
their
land
in
comparison
to
the
computation
of
their
money
was
readily
answered
by
evan
with
the
old
jest
deil
take

wha
have
the

footnote
the
scotch
are
liberal
in
computing
their

can
the

pretend
to
sense
their

and
now
the
report
of
a
gun
was
heard
and
a
sportsman
was
seen
with
his
dogs
and
attendant
at
the
upper
end
of
the
glen

not

imperiously
you
think
he
would
come

in
such
a
way
as
that
but
as
they
approached
a
little
nearer
he
said
with
an
appearance
of
mortification
it
is
even
he
sure
enough
and
he
has
not
his
tail
on
after
all
there
is
no
living
creature
with
him
but
callum

of
whom
a
frenchman
might
have
said
as
truly
as
of
any
man
in
the
highlands
connoit
bien
ses
gens
had
no
idea
of
raising
himself
in
the
eyes
of
an
english
young
man
of
fortune
by
appearing
with
a
retinue
of
idle
highlanders
disproportioned
to
the
occasion
he
was
well
aware
that
such
an
unnecessary
attendance
would
seem
to
edward
rather
ludicrous
than
respectable
and
while
few
men
were
more
attached
to
ideas
of
chieftainship
and
feudal
power
he
was
for
that
very
reason
cautious
of
exhibiting
external
marks
of
dignity
unless
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner
when
they
were
most
likely
to
produce
an
imposing
effect
therefore
although
had
he
been
to
receive
a
brother
chieftain
he
would
probably
have
been
attended
by
all
that
retinue
which
evan
described
with
so
much
unction
he
judged
it
more
respectable
to
advance
to
meet
waverley
with
a
single
attendant
a
very
handsome
highland
boy
who
carried
his
master
and
his
broadsword
without
which
he
seldom
went
abroad
when
fergus
and
waverley
met
the
latter
was
struck
with
the
peculiar
grace
and
dignity
of
the
chieftain
figure
above
the
middle
size
and
finely
proportioned
the
highland
dress
which
he
wore
in
its
simplest
mode
set
off
his
person
to
great
advantage
he
wore
the
trews
or
close
trowsers
made
of
tartan
chequed
scarlet
and
white
in
other
particulars
his
dress
strictly
resembled
evan
excepting
that
he
had
no
weapon
save
a
dirk
very
richly
mounted
with
silver
his
page
as
we
have
said
carried
his
claymore
and
the
which
he
held
in
his
hand
seemed
only
designed
for
sport
he
had
shot
in
the
course
of
his
walk
some
young
as
though
close
time
was
then
unknown
the
broods
of
grouse
were
yet
too
young
for
the
sportsman
his
countenance
was
decidedly
scottish
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
the
northern
physiognomy
but
yet
had
so
little
of
its
harshness
and
exaggeration
that
it
would
have
been
pronounced
in
any
country
extremely
handsome
the
martial
air
of
the
bonnet
with
a
single
eagle
feather
as
a
distinction
added
much
to
the
manly
appearance
of
his
head
which
was
besides
ornamented
with
a
far
more
natural
and
graceful
cluster
of
close
black
curls
than
ever
were
exposed
to
sale
in
bond
street
an
air
of
openness
and
affability
increased
the
favorable
impression
derived
from
this
handsome
and
dignified
exterior
yet
a
skilful
physiognomist
would
have
been
less
satisfied
with
the
countenance
on
the
second
than
on
the
first
view
the
eyebrow
and
upper
lip
bespoke
something
of
the
habit
of
peremptory
command
and
decisive
superiority
even
his
courtesy
though
open
frank
and
unconstrained
seemed
to
indicate
a
sense
of
personal
importance
and
upon
any
check
or
accidental
excitation
a
sudden
though
transient
lour
of
the
eye
showed
a
hasty
haughty
and
vindictive
temper
not
less
to
be
dreaded
because
it
seemed
much
under
its
owner
command
in
short
the
countenance
of
the
chieftain
resembled
a
smiling
summer
day
in
which
notwithstanding
we
are
made
sensible
by
certain
though
slight
signs
that
it
may
thunder
and
lighten
before
the
close
of
evening
it
was
not
however
upon
their
first
meeting
that
edward
had
an
opportunity
of
making
these
less
favourable
remarks
the
chief
received
him
as
a
friend
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
with
the
utmost
expression
of
kindness
and
obligation
for
the
visit
upbraided
him
gently
with
choosing
so
rude
an
abode
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
and
entered
into
a
lively
conversation
with
him
about
donald
bean
housekeeping
but
without
the
least
hint
as
to
his
predatory
habits
or
the
immediate
occasion
of
visit
a
topic
which
as
the
chief
did
not
introduce
it
our
hero
also
avoided
while
they
walked
merrily
on
towards
the
house
of
glennaquoich
evan
who
now
fell
respectfully
into
the
rear
followed
with
callum
beg
and
dugald
mahony
we
shall
take
the
opportunity
to
introduce
the
reader
to
some
particulars
of
fergus
character
and
history
which
were
not
completely
known
to
waverley
till
after
a
connection
which
though
arising
from
a
circumstance
so
casual
had
for
a
length
of
time
the
deepest
influence
upon
his
character
actions
and
prospects
but
this
being
an
important
subject
must
form
the
commencement
of
a
new
chapter
chapter
xix
the
chief
and
his
mansion
the
ingenious
licentiate
francisco
de
ubeda
when
he
commenced
his
history
of
picara
justina
diez
which
by
the
way
is
one
of
the
most
rare
books
of
spanish
literature
complained
of
his
pen
having
caught
up
a
hair
and
forthwith
begins
with
more
eloquence
than
common
sense
an
affectionate
expostulation
with
that
useful
implement
upbraiding
it
with
being
the
quill
of
a
goose
a
bird
inconstant
by
nature
as
frequenting
the
three
elements
of
water
earth
and
air
indifferently
and
being
of
course
one
thing
constant
never
now
i
protest
to
thee
gentle
reader
that
i
entirely
dissent
from
francisco
de
ubeda
in
this
matter
and
hold
it
the
most
useful
quality
of
my
pen
that
it
can
speedily
change
from
grave
to
gay
and
from
description
and
dialogue
to
narrative
and
character
so
that
if
my
quill
display
no
other
properties
of
its
than
her
mutability
truly
i
shall
be
well
pleased
and
i
conceive
that
you
my
worthy
friend
will
have
no
occasion
for
discontent
from
the
jargon
therefore
of
the
highland
gillies
i
pass
to
the
character
of
their
chief
it
is
an
important
examination
and
therefore
like
dogberry
we
must
spare
no
wisdom
the
ancestor
of
fergus
about
three
centuries
before
had
set
up
a
claim
to
be
recognised
as
chief
of
the
numerous
and
powerful
clan
to
which
he
belonged
the
name
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
being
defeated
by
an
opponent
who
had
more
justice
or
at
least
more
force
on
his
side
he
moved
southwards
with
those
who
adhered
to
him
in
quest
of
new
settlements
like

adventurer
united
himself
with
those
who
were
commissioned
by
the
king
to
chastise
him
and
did
such
good
service
that
he
obtained
a
grant
of
the
property
upon
which
he
and
his
posterity
afterwards
resided
he
followed
the
king
also
in
war
to
the
fertile
regions
of
england
where
he
employed
his
leisure
hours
so
actively
in
raising
subsidies
among
the
boors
of
northumberland
and
durham
that
upon
his
return
he
was
enabled
to
erect
a
stone
tower
or
fortalice
so
much
admired
by
his
dependants
and
neighbours
that
he
who
had
hitherto
been
called
ian

son
of

was
thereafter
distinguished
both
in
song
and
genealogy
by
the
high
title
of
ian

or
john
of

the
descendants
of
this

were
so
proud
of
him
that
the
reigning

always
bore
the
patronymic
title
of

footnote
see
note
it
was
soon
perceived
that
he
possessed
a
character
of
uncommon
acuteness
fire
and
ambition
which
as
he
became
acquainted
with
the
state
of
the
country
gradually
assumed
a
mixed
and
peculiar
tone
that
could
only
have
been
acquired
sixty
years
since
had
fergus
lived
sixty
years
sooner
than
he
did
he
would
in
all
probability
have
wanted
the
polished
manner
and
knowledge
of
the
world
which
he
now
possessed
and
had
he
lived
sixty
years
later
his
ambition
and
love
of
rule
would
have
lacked
the
fuel
which
his
situation
now
afforded
he
was
indeed
within
his
little
circle
as
perfect
a
politician
as
castruccio
castracani
himself
he
applied
himself
with
great
earnestness
to
appease
all
the
feuds
and
dissensions
which
often
arose
among
other
clans
in
his
neighbourhood
so
that
he
became
a
frequent
umpire
in
their
quarrels
his
own
patriarchal
power
he
strengthened
at
every
expense
which
his
fortune
would
permit
and
indeed
stretched
his
means
to
the
uttermost
to
maintain
the
rude
and
plentiful
hospitality
which
was
the
most
valued
attribute
of
a
chieftain
for
the
same
reason
he
crowded
his
estate
with
a
tenantry
hardy
indeed
and
fit
for
the
purposes
of
war
but
greatly
outnumbering
what
the
soil
was
calculated
to
maintain
these
consisted
chiefly
of
his
own
clan
not
one
of
whom
he
suffered
to
quit
his
lands
if
he
could
possibly
prevent
it
but
he
maintained
besides
many
adventurers
from
the
mother
sept
who
deserted
a
less
warlike
though
more
wealthy
chief
to
do
homage
to
fergus
other
individuals
too
who
had
not
even
that
apology
were
nevertheless
received
into
his
allegiance
which
indeed
was
refused
to
none
who
were
like
poins
proper
men
of
their
hands
and
were
willing
to
assume
the
name
of
he
was
enabled
to
discipline
these
forces
from
having
obtained
command
of
one
of
the
independent
companies
raised
by
government
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
highlands
while
in
this
capacity
he
acted
with
vigour
and
spirit
and
preserved
great
order
in
the
country
under
his
charge
he
caused
his
vassals
to
enter
by
rotation
into
his
company
and
serve
for
a
certain
space
of
time
which
gave
them
all
in
turn
a
general
notion
of
military
discipline
in
his
campaigns
against
the
banditti
it
was
observed
that
he
assumed
and
exercised
to
the
utmost
the
discretionary
power
which
while
the
law
had
no
free
course
in
the
highlands
was
conceived
to
belong
to
the
military
parties
who
were
called
in
to
support
it
he
acted
for
example
with
great
and
suspicious
lenity
to
those
freebooters
who
made
restitution
on
his
summons
and
offered
personal
submission
to
himself
while
he
rigorously
pursued
apprehended
and
sacrificed
to
justice
all
such
interlopers
as
dared
to
despise
his
admonitions
or
commands
on
the
other
hand
if
any
officers
of
justice
military
parties
or
others
presumed
to
pursue
thieves
or
marauders
through
his
territories
and
without
applying
for
his
consent
and
concurrence
nothing
was
more
certain
than
that
they
would
meet
with
some
notable
foil
or
defeat
upon
which
occasions
fergus
was
the
first
to
condole
with
them
and
after
gently
blaming
their
rashness
never
failed
deeply
to
lament
the
lawless
state
of
the
country
these
lamentations
did
not
exclude
suspicion
and
matters
were
so
represented
to
government
that
our
chieftain
was
deprived
of
his
military
command
footnote
see
note
whatever
fergus
felt
on
this
occasion
he
had
the
art
of
entirely
suppressing
every
appearance
of
discontent
but
in
a
short
time
the
neighbouring
country
began
to
feel
bad
effects
from
his
disgrace
donald
bean
lean
and
others
of
his
class
whose
depredations
had
hitherto
been
confined
to
other
districts
appeared
from
thenceforward
to
have
made
a
settlement
on
this
devoted
border
and
their
ravages
were
carried
on
with
little
opposition
as
the
lowland
gentry
were
chiefly
jacobites
and
disarmed
this
forced
many
of
the
inhabitants
into
contracts
of
with
fergus
which
not
only
established
him
their
protector
and
gave
him
great
weight
in
all
their
consultations
but
moreover
supplied
funds
for
the
waste
of
his
feudal
hospitality
which
the
discontinuance
of
his
pay
might
have
otherwise
essentially
diminished
in
following
this
course
of
conduct
fergus
had
a
further
object
than
merely
being
the
great
man
of
his
neighbourhood
and
ruling
despotically
over
a
small
clan
from
his
infancy
upward
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
cause
of
the
exiled
family
and
had
persuaded
himself
not
only
that
their
restoration
to
the
crown
of
britain
would
be
speedy
but
that
those
who
assisted
them
would
be
raised
to
honour
and
rank
it
was
with
this
view
that
he
laboured
to
reconcile
the
highlanders
among
themselves
and
augmented
his
own
force
to
the
utmost
to
be
prepared
for
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
rising
with
this
purpose
also
he
conciliated
the
favour
of
such
lowland
gentlemen
in
the
vicinity
as
were
friends
to
the
good
cause
and
for
the
same
reason
having
incautiously
quarrelled
with
bradwardine
who
notwithstanding
his
peculiarities
was
much
respected
in
the
country
he
took
advantage
of
the
foray
of
donald
bean
lean
to
solder
up
the
dispute
in
the
manner
we
have
mentioned
some
indeed
surmised
that
he
caused
the
enterprise
to
be
suggested
to
donald
on
purpose
to
pave
the
way
to
a
reconciliation
which
supposing
that
to
be
the
case
cost
the
laird
of
bradwardine
two
good
milch
cows
this
zeal
in
their
behalf
the
house
of
stuart
repaid
with
a
considerable
share
of
their
confidence
an
occasional
supply
of
abundance
of
fair
words
and
a
parchment
with
a
huge
waxen
seal
appended
purporting
to
be
an
earl
patent
granted
by
no
less
a
person
than
james
the
third
king
of
england
and
eighth
king
of
scotland
to
his
right
feal
trusty
and
fergus
of
glennaquoich
in
the
county
of
perth
and
kingdom
of
scotland
with
this
future
coronet
glittering
before
his
eyes
fergus
plunged
deeply
into
the
correspondence
and
plots
of
that
unhappy
period
and
like
all
such
active
agents
easily
reconciled
his
conscience
to
going
certain
lengths
in
the
service
of
his
party
from
which
honour
and
pride
would
have
deterred
him
had
his
sole
object
been
the
direct
advancement
of
his
own
personal
interest
with
this
insight
into
a
bold
ambitious
and
ardent
yet
artful
and
politic
character
we
resume
the
broken
thread
of
our
narrative
the
chief
and
his
guest
had
by
this
time
reached
the
house
of
glennaquoich
which
consisted
of
ian
nan
chaistel
mansion
a
high
square
tower
with
the
addition
of
a
lofted
house
that
is
a
building
of
two
stories
constructed
by
grandfather
when
he
returned
from
that
memorable
expedition
well
remembered
by
the
western
shires
under
the
name
of
the
highland
host
upon
occasion
of
this
crusade
against
the
ayrshire
whigs
and
covenanters
the
vich
ian
vohr
of
the
time
had
probably
been
as
successful
as
his
predecessor
was
in
harrying
northumberland
and
therefore
left
to
his
posterity
a
rival
edifice
as
a
monument
of
his
magnificence
around
the
house
which
stood
on
an
eminence
in
the
midst
of
a
narrow
highland
valley
there
appeared
none
of
that
attention
to
convenience
far
less
to
ornament
and
decoration
which
usually
surrounds
a
gentleman
habitation
an
inclosure
or
two
divided
by
walls
were
the
only
part
of
the
domain
that
was
fenced
as
to
the
rest
the
narrow
slips
of
level
ground
which
lay
by
the
side
of
the
brook
exhibited
a
scanty
crop
of
barley
liable
to
constant
depredations
from
the
herds
of
wild
ponies
and
black
cattle
that
grazed
upon
the
adjacent
hills
these
ever
and
anon
made
an
incursion
upon
the
arable
ground
which
was
repelled
by
the
loud
uncouth
and
dissonant
shouts
of
half
a
dozen
highland
swains
all
running
as
if
they
had
been
mad
and
every
one
hallooing
a
dog
to
the
rescue
of
the
forage
at
a
little
distance
up
the
glen
was
a
small
and
stunted
wood
of
birch
the
hills
were
high
and
heathy
but
without
any
variety
of
surface
so
that
the
whole
view
was
wild
and
desolate
rather
than
grand
and
solitary
yet
such
as
it
was
no
genuine
descendant
of
ian
nan
chaistel
would
have
changed
the
domain
for
stow
or
blenheim
there
was
a
sight
however
before
the
gate
which
perhaps
would
have
afforded
the
first
owner
of
blenheim
more
pleasure
than
the
finest
view
in
the
domain
assigned
to
him
by
the
gratitude
of
his
country
this
consisted
of
about
a
hundred
highlanders
in
complete
dress
and
arms
at
sight
of
whom
the
chieftain
apologised
to
waverley
in
a
sort
of
negligent
manner
had
forgot
he
said
he
had
ordered
a
few
of
his
clan
out
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
that
they
were
in
a
fit
condition
to
protect
the
country
and
prevent
such
accidents
as
he
was
sorry
to
learn
had
befallen
the
baron
of
bradwardine
before
they
were
dismissed
perhaps
captain
waverley
might
choose
to
see
them
go
through
a
part
of
their
exercise
edward
assented
and
the
men
executed
with
agility
and
precision
some
of
the
ordinary
military
movements
they
then
practised
individually
at
a
mark
and
showed
extraordinary
dexterity
in
the
management
of
the
pistol
and
firelock
they
took
aim
standing
sitting
leaning
or
lying
prostrate
as
they
were
commanded
and
always
with
effect
upon
the
target
next
they
paired
off
for
the
broadsword
exercise
and
having
manifested
their
individual
skill
and
dexterity
united
in
two
bodies
and
exhibited
a
sort
of
mock
encounter
in
which
the
charge
the
rally
the
flight
the
pursuit
and
all
the
current
of
a
heady
fight
were
exhibited
to
the
sound
of
the
great
war
bagpipe
on
a
signal
made
by
the
chief
the
skirmish
was
ended
matches
were
then
made
for
running
wrestling
leaping
pitching
the
bar
and
other
sports
in
which
this

a
highland
feast
ere
waverley
entered
the
banqueting
hall
he
was
offered
the
patriarchal
refreshment
of
a
bath
for
the
feet
which
the
sultry
weather
and
the
morasses
he
had
traversed
rendered
highly
acceptable
he
was
not
indeed
so
luxuriously
attended
upon
this
occasion
as
the
heroic
travellers
in
the
odyssey
the
task
of
ablution
and
abstersion
being
performed
not
by
a
beautiful
damsel
trained
to
chafe
the
limb
and
pour
the
fragrant
oil
but
by
a
skinny
old
highland
woman
who
did
not
seem
to
think
herself
much
honoured
by
the
duty
imposed
upon
her
but
muttered
between
her
teeth
fathers
herds
did
not
feed
so
near
together
that
i
should
do
you
this
service
a
small
donation
however
amply
reconciled
this
ancient
handmaiden
to
the
supposed
degradation
and
as
edward
proceeded
to
the
hall
she
gave
him
her
blessing
in
the
gaelic
proverb
the
open
hand
be
filled
the
fullest
the
hall
in
which
the
feast
was
prepared

all
the
first
story
of
lan
nan
chaistel
original
erection
and
a
huge
oaken
table
extended
through
its
whole
length
the
apparatus
for
dinner
was
simple
even
to
rudeness
and
the
company
numerous
even
to
crowding
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
the
chief
himself
with
edward
and
two
or
three
highland
visitors
of
neighbouring
clans
the
elders
of
his
own
tribe
wadsetters
and
tacksmen
as
they
were
called
who
occupied
portions
of
his
estate
as
mortgagers
or
lessees
sat
next
in
rank
beneath
them
their
sons
and
nephews
and
then
the
officers
of
the
chief
household
according
to
their
order
and
lowest
of
all
the
tenants
who
actually
cultivated
the
ground
even
beyond
this
long
perspective
edward
might
see
upon
the
green
to
which
a
huge
pair
of
folding
doors
opened
a
multitude
of
highlanders
of
a
yet
inferior
description
who
nevertheless
were
considered
as
guests
and
had
their
share
both
of
the
countenance
of
the
entertainer
and
of
the
cheer
of
the
day
in
the
distance
and
fluctuating
round
this
extreme
verge
of
the
banquet
was
a
changeful
group
of
women
ragged
boys
and
girls
beggars
young
and
old
large
greyhounds
and
terriers
and
pointers
and
curs
of
low
degree
all
of
whom
took
some
interest
more
or
less
immediate
in
the
main
action
of
the
piece
this
hospitality
apparently
unbounded
had
yet
its
line
of
economy
some
pains
had
been
bestowed
in
dressing
the
dishes
of
fish
game
which
were
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
and
immediately
under
the
eye
of
the
english
stranger
lower
down
stood
immense
clumsy
joints
of
mutton
and
beef
which

the
absence
of
pork

abhorred
in
the
highlands
resembled
the
rude
festivity
of
the
banquet
of
penelope
suitors
but
the
central
dish
was
a
yearling
lamb
called
hog
in
roasted
whole
it
was
set
upon
its
legs
with
a
bunch
of
parsley
in
its
mouth
and
was
probably
exhibited
in
that
form
to
gratify
the
pride
of
the
cook
who
piqued
himself
more
on
the
plenty
than
the
elegance
of
his
master
table
the
sides
of
this
poor
animal
were
fiercely
attacked
by
the
clansmen
some
with
dirks
others
with
the
knives
which
were
usually
in
the
same
sheath
with
the
dagger
so
that
it
was
soon
rendered
a
mangled
and
rueful
spectacle

victuals
seemed
of

coarser
quality

feast
regaled
the
sons
of
ivor
who
feasted
in
the
open
air
the
liquor
was
supplied
in
the
same
proportion
and
under
similar
regulations
excellent
claret
and
champagne
were
liberally
distributed
among
the
chief
immediate
neighbours
whisky
plain
or
diluted
and
strong
beer
refreshed
those
who
sat
near
the
lower
end
nor
did
this
inequality
of
distribution
appear
to
give
the
least
offence
every
one
present
understood
that
his
taste
was
to
be
formed
according
to
the
rank
which
he
held
at
table
and
consequently
the
tacksmen
and
their
dependants
always
professed
the
wine
was
too
cold
for
their
stomachs
and
called
apparently
out
of
choice
for
the
liquor
which
was
assigned
to
them
from
economy

the

screamed
during
the
whole
time
of
dinner
a
tremendous
and
the
echoing
of
the
vaulted
roof
and
clang
of
the
celtic
tongue
produced
such
a
babel
of
noises
that
waverley
dreaded
his
ears
would
never
recover
it
indeed
apologised
for
the
confusion
occasioned
by
so
large
a
party
and
pleaded
the
necessity
of
his
situation
on
which
unlimited
hospitality
was
imposed
as
a
paramount
duty

of
mine

said
my

i
must

the
rogues
will
do
nothing
for

practise
the
broadsword
or
wander
about
the
hills
shooting
fishing
hunting
drinking
and
making
love
to
the
lasses
of
the
strath
but
what
can
i
do
captain
waverley
everything
will
keep
after
its
kind
whether
it
be
a
hawk
or
a
highlander
edward
made
the
expected
answer
in
a
compliment
upon
his
possessing
so
many
bold
and
attached
followers
yes
replied
the
chief
i
disposed
like
my
father
to
put
myself
in
the
way
of
getting
one
blow
on
the
head
or
two
on
the
neck
i
believe
the
loons
would
stand
by
me
but
who
thinks
of
that
in
the
present
day
when
the
maxim
is
better
an
old
woman
with
a
purse
in
her
hand
than
three
men
with
belted
brands
then
turning
to
the
company
he
proposed
the
of
captain
waverley
a
worthy
friend
of
his
kind
neighbour
and
ally
the
baron
of
bradwardine
is
welcome
hither
said
one
of
the
elders
he
come
from
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
say
nay
to
that
said
an
old
man
who
apparently
did
not
mean
to
pledge
the
toast
say
nay
to
that
while
there
is
a
green
leaf
in
the
forest
there
will
be
fraud
in
a
comyne
is
nothing
but
honour
in
the
baron
of
bradwardine
answered
another
ancient
the
guest
that
comes
hither
from
him
should
be
welcome
though
he
came
with
blood
on
his
hand
unless
it
were
blood
of
the
race
of
ivor
the
old
man
whose
cup
remained
full
replied
has
been
blood
enough
of
the
race
of
ivor
on
the
hand
of
bradwardine
ballenkeiroch
replied
the
first
think
rather
of
the
flash
of
the
carbine
at
the
mains
of
than
the
glance
of
the
sword
that
fought
for
the
cause
at
preston
well
i
may
answered
ballenkeiroch
flash
of
the
gun
cost
me
a
son
and
the
glance
of
the
sword
has
done
but
little
for
king
james
the
chieftain
in
two
words
of
french
explained
to
waverley
that
the
baron
had
shot
this
old
man
son
in
a
fray
near
about
seven
years
before
and
then
hastened
to
remove
ballenkeiroch
prejudice
by
informing
him
that
waverley
was
an
englishman
unconnected
by
birth
or
alliance
with
the
family
of
bradwardine
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
raised
the
untasted
cup
and
courteously
drank
to
his
health
this
ceremony
being
requited
in
kind
the
chieftain
made
a
signal
for
the
pipes
to
cease
and
said
aloud
is
the
song
hidden
my
friends
that
can
not
find
it
the
family
bhairdh
an
aged
man
immediately
took
the
hint
and
began
to
chant
with
low
and
rapid
utterance
a
profusion
of
celtic
verses
which
were
received
by
the
audience
with
all
the
applause
of
enthusiasm
as
he
advanced
in
his
declamation
his
ardour
seemed
to
increase
he
had
at
first
spoken
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
now
cast
them
around
as
if
beseeching
and
anon
as
if
commanding
attention
and
his
tones
rose
into
wild
and
impassioned
notes
accompanied
with
appropriate
gestures
he
seemed
to
edward
who
attended
to
him
with
much
interest
to
recite
many
proper
names
to
lament
the
dead
to
apostrophise
the
absent
to
exhort
and
entreat
and
animate
those
who
were
present
waverley
thought
he
even
discerned
his
own
name
and
was
convinced
his
conjecture
was
right
from
the
eyes
of
the
company
being
at
that
moment
turned
towards
him
simultaneously
the
ardour
of
the
poet
appeared
to
communicate
itself
to
the
audience
their
wild
and
countenances
assumed
a
fiercer
and
more
animated
expression
all
bent
forward
towards
the
reciter
many
sprung
up
and
waved
their
arms
in
ecstasy
and
some
laid
their
hands
on
their
swords
when
the
song
ceased
there
was
a
deep
pause
while
the
aroused
feelings
of
the
poet
and
of
the
hearers
gradually
subsided
into
their
usual
channel
the
chieftain
who
during
this
scene
had
appeared
rather
to
watch
the
emotions
which
were
excited
than
to
partake
their
high
tone
of
enthusiasm
filled
with
claret
a
small
silver
cup
which
stood
by
him
this
he
said
to
an
attendant
nan
fonn
of
the
songs
and
when
he
has
drank
the
juice
bid
him
keep
for
the
sake
of
vich
ian
vohr
the
shell
of
the
gourd
which
contained
it
the
gift
was
received
by
with
profound
gratitude
he
drank
the
wine
and
kissing
the
cup
shrouded
it
with
reverence
in
the
plaid
which
was
folded
on
his
bosom
he
then
burst
forth
into
what
edward
justly
supposed
to
be
an
extemporaneous
effusion
of
thanks
and
praises
of
his
chief
it
was
received
with
applause
but
did
not
produce
the
effect
of
his
first
poem
it
was
obvious
however
that
the
clan
regarded
the
generosity
of
their
chieftain
with
high
approbation
many
approved
gaelic
toasts
were
then
proposed
of
some
of
which
the
chieftain
gave
his
guest
the
following
versions
him
that
will
not
turn
his
back
on
friend
or
foe
him
that
never
forsook
a
comrade
him
that
never
bought
or
sold
justice
to
the
exile
and
broken
bones
to
the
tyrant
lads
with
the
kilts
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
many
other
pithy
sentiments
of
the
like
nature
edward
was
particularly
solicitous
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
song
which
appeared
to
produce
such
effect
upon
the
passions
of
the
company
and
hinted
his
curiosity
to
his
host
i
observe
said
the
chieftain
you
have
passed
the
bottle
during
the
last
three
rounds
i
was
about
to
propose
to
you
to
retire
to
my
sister
who
can
explain
these
things
to
you
better
than
i
can
although
i
can
not
stint
my
clan
in
the
usual
current
of
their
festivity
yet
i
neither
am
addicted
myself
to
exceed
in
its
amount
nor
do
i
added
he
smiling
a
bear
to
devour
the
intellects
of
such
as
can
make
good
use
of
them
edward
readily
assented
to
this
proposal
and
the
chieftain
saying
a
few
words
to
those
around
him
left
the
table
followed
by
waverley
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
edward
heard
vich
ian
vohr
health
invoked
with
a
wild
and
animated
cheer
that
expressed
the
satisfaction
of
the
guests
and
the
depth
of
their
devotion
to
his
service
chapter
xxi
the
chieftain
sister
the
of
flora
was
furnished
in
the
plainest
and
most
simple
manner
for
at
glennaquoich
every
other
sort
of
expenditure
was
retrenched
as
much
as
possible
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
in
its
full
dignity
the
hospitality
of
the
chieftain
and
retaining
and
multiplying
the
number
of
his
dependants
and
adherents
but
there
was
no
appearance
of
this
parsimony
in
the
dress
of
the
lady
herself
which
was
in
texture
elegant
and
even
rich
and
arranged
in
a
manner
which
partook
partly
of
the
parisian
fashion
and
partly
of
the
more
simple
dress
of
the
highlands
blended
together
with
great
taste
her
hair
was
not
disfigured
by
the
art
of
the
friseur
but
fell
in
jetty
ringlets
on
her
neck
confined
only
by
a
circlet
richly
set
with
diamonds
this
peculiarity
she
adopted
in
compliance
with
the
highland
prejudices
which
could
not
endure
that
a
woman
head
should
be
covered
before
wedlock
flora
bore
a
most
striking
resemblance
to
her
brother
fergus
so
much
so
that
they
might
have
played
viola
and
sebastian
with
the
same
exquisite
effect
produced
by
the
appearance
of
henry
siddons
and
her
brother
william
murray
in
these
characters
they
had
the
same
antique
and
regular
correctness
of
profile
the
same
dark
eyes
and
the
same
clearness
of
complexion
excepting
that
fergus
was
embrowned
by
exercise
and
flora
possessed
the
utmost
feminine
delicacy
but
the
haughty
and
somewhat
stern
regularity
of
fergus
features
was
beautifully
softened
in
those
of
flora
their
voices
were
also
similar
in
tone
though
differing
in
the
key
that
of
fergus
especially
while
issuing
orders
to
his
followers
during
their
military
exercise
reminded
edward
of
a
favourite
passage
in
the
description
of
emetrius
whose
voice
was
heard
around
loud
as
a
trumpet
with
a
silver
sound
that
of
flora
on
the
contrary
was
soft
and
sweet
excellent
thing
in
woman
yet
in
urging
any
favourite
topic
which
she
often
pursued
with
natural
eloquence
it
possessed
as
well
the
tones
which
impress
awe
and
conviction
as
those
of
persuasive
insinuation
the
eager
glance
of
the
keen
black
eye
which
in
the
chieftain
seemed
impatient
even
of
the
material
obstacles
it
encountered
had
in
his
sister
acquired
a
gentle
pensiveness
his
looks
seemed
to
seek
glory
power
all
that
could
exalt
him
above
others
in
the
race
of
humanity
while
those
of
his
sister
as
if
she
were
already
conscious
of
mental
superiority
seemed
to
pity
rather
than
envy
those
who
were
struggling
for
any
farther
distinction
her
sentiments
corresponded
with
the
expression
of
her
countenance
early
education
had
impressed
upon
her
mind
as
well
as
on
that
of
the
chieftain
the
most
devoted
attachment
to
the
exiled
family
of
stuart
she
believed
it
the
duty
of
her
brother
of
his
clan
of
every
man
in
britain
at
whatever
personal
hazard
to
contribute
to
that
restoration
which
the
partisans
of
the
chevalier
george
had
not
ceased
to
hope
for
for
this
she
was
prepared
to
do
all
to
suffer
all
to
sacrifice
all
but
her
loyalty
as
it
exceeded
her
brother
in
fanaticism
excelled
it
also
in
purity
accustomed
to
petty
intrigue
and
necessarily
involved
in
a
thousand
paltry
and
selfish
discussions
ambitious
also
by
nature
his
political
faith
was
tinctured
at
least
if
not
tainted
by
the
views
of
interest
and
advancement
so
easily
combined
with
it
and
at
the
moment
he
should
unsheathe
his
claymore
it
might
be
difficult
to
say
whether
it
would
be
most
with
the
view
of
making
james
stuart
a
king
or
fergus
an
earl
this
indeed
was
a
mixture
of
feeling
which
he
did
not
avow
even
to
himself
but
it
existed
nevertheless
in
a
powerful
degree
in
flora
bosom
on
the

views

patriotism

instances
of
devotion
were
not
uncommon
among
the
followers
of
the
unhappy
race
of
stuart
of
which
many
memorable
proofs
will
recur
to
the
minds
of
most
of
my
readers
but
peculiar
attention
on
the
part
of
the
chevalier
de
george
and
his
princess
to
the
parents
of
fergus
and
his
sister
and
to
themselves
when
orphans
had
riveted
their
faith
fergus
upon
the
death
of
his
parents
had
been
for
some
time
a
page
of
honour
in
the
train
of
the
chevalier
lady
and
from
his
beauty
and
sprightly
temper
was
uniformly
treated
by
her
with
the
utmost
distinction
this
was
also
extended
to
flora
who
was
maintained
for
some
time
at
a
convent
of
the
first
order
at
the
expense
and
removed
from
thence
into
her
own
family
where
she
spent
nearly
two
years
both
brother
and
sister
retained
the
deepest
and
most
grateful
sense
of
her
kindness
having
thus
touched
upon
the
leading
principle
of
character
i
may
dismiss
the
rest
more
slightly
she
was
highly
accomplished
and
had
acquired
those
elegant
manners
to
be
expected
from
one
who
in
early
youth
had
been
the
companion
of
a
princess
yet
she
had
not
learned
to
substitute
the
gloss
of
politeness
for
the
reality
of
feeling
when
settled
in
the
lonely
regions
of
glennaquoich
she
found
that
her
resources
in
french
english
and
italian
literature
were
likely
to
be
few
and
interrupted
and
in
order
to
fill
up
the
vacant
time
she
bestowed
a
part
of
it
upon
the
music
and
poetical
traditions
of
the
highlanders
and
began
really
to
feel
the
pleasure
in
the
pursuit
which
her
brother
whose
perceptions
of
literary
merit
were
more
blunt
rather
affected
for
the
sake
of
popularity
than
actually
experienced
her
resolution
was
strengthened
in
these
researches
by
the
extreme
delight
which
her
inquiries
seemed
to
afford
those
to
whom
she
resorted
for
information
her
love
of
her
clan
an
attachment
which
was
almost
hereditary
in
her
bosom
was
like
her
loyalty
a
more
pure
passion
than
that
of
her
brother
he
was
too
thorough
a
politician
regarded
his
patriarchal
influence
too
much
as
the
means
of
accomplishing
his
own
aggrandisement
that
we
should
term
him
the
model
of
a
highland
chieftain
flora
felt
the
same
anxiety
for
cherishing
and
extending
their
patriarchal
sway
but
it
was
with
the
generous
desire
of
vindicating
from
poverty
or
at
least
from
want
and
foreign
oppression
those
whom
her
brother
was
by
birth
according
to
the
notions
of
the
time
and

entitled
to
govern
the
savings
of
her
income

dedicated
not
to
add
to
the
comforts
of
the
peasantry
for
that
was
a
word
which
they
neither
knew
nor
apparently
wished
to
know
but
to
relieve
their
absolute
necessities
when
in
sickness
or
extreme
old
age
at
every
other
period
they
rather
toiled
to
procure
something
which
they
might
share
with
the
chief
as
a
proof
of
their
attachment
than
expected
other
assistance
from
him
save
what
was
afforded
by
the
rude
hospitality
of
his
castle
and
the
general
division
and
subdivision
of
his
estate
among

was
so
much
beloved
by
them
that
when
composed
a
song
in
which
he
enumerated
all
the
principal
beauties
of
the
district
and
intimated
her
superiority
by
concluding
that
fairest
apple
hung
on
the
highest
bough
he
received
in
donatives
from
the
individuals
of
the

most
intimate
friend
had
been
rose
bradwardine
to
whom
she
was
much
attached
and
when
seen
together
they
would
have
afforded
an
artist
two
admirable
subjects
for
the
gay
and
the
melancholy
muse
indeed
rose
was
so
tenderly
watched
by
her
father
and
her
circle
of
wishes
was
so
limited
that
none
arose

what
he
was
willing
to
gratify
and
scarce
any
which
did
not
come
within
the
compass
of
his
power

it
was
otherwise
while
almost
a
girl
she
had
undergone
the
most
complete
change
of
scene
from
gaiety
and
splendour
to
absolute
solitude
and
comparative
poverty
and
the
ideas
and
wishes
which
she
chiefly
fostered
respected
great
national
events

changes
not
to
be
brought
round
without
both
hazard
and
bloodshed
and
therefore
not
to
be
thought
of
with
levity
her
manner
consequently
was
grave
though
she
readily
contributed
her
talents
to
the
amusement
of
society
and
stood
very
high
in
the
opinion
of
the
old
baron
who
used
to
sing
along
with
her
such
french
duets
of
lindor
and
cloris
as
were
in
fashion
about
the
end
of
the
reign
of
old
louis
le

it
was
generally
believed
though
no
one
durst
have
hinted
it
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
that
flora
entreaties
had
no
small
share
in
allaying
the
wrath
of
fergus
upon
occasion
of
their
quarrel
she
took
her
brother
on
the
assailable
side
by
dwelling
first
upon
the
baron
age
and
then
representing
the
injury
which
the
cause
might
sustain
and
the
damage
which
must
arise
to
his
own
character
in
point
of
prudence
so
necessary
to
a
political
agent
if
he
persisted
in
carrying
it
to
extremity
otherwise
it
is
probable
it
would
have
terminated
in
a
duel
both
because
the
baron
had
on
a
former
occasion
shed
blood
of
the
clan
though
the
matter
had
been
timely
accommodated
and
on
account
of
his
high
reputation
for
address
at
his
weapon
which
fergus
almost
condescended
to
envy
for
the
same
reason
she
had
urged
their
reconciliation
which
the
chieftain
the
more
readily
agreed
to
as
it
favoured
some
ulterior
projects

his
own

served
only
as

the
grace

beauty

their
patroness
the
discourse
followed
the
turn
which
the

had
given
it
and
waverley
was
equally
amused

surprised
with
the
account

very
ancient

if
they
are
ever
translated
into
any
of
the
languages
of
civilised
europe
can
not
fail
to
produce
a
deep
and
general
sensation
others

more
modern
the

the

distinguished

retain

the

possess
various
degrees
of
merit

much
of
it
must
evaporate
in

be
lost
on
those
who
do
not
sympathise
with
the
feelings
of

whose
effusions

produce
such
effect

question

has
not

you
the
gaelic
language

uncommonly
vocalic
is
well

extemporaneous

and
i
will
join
you
there
una
having
received
instructions
in
her
native
language
conducted
waverley
out
by
a
passage
different
from
that
through
which
he
had
entered
the
apartment
at
a
distance
he
heard
the
hall
of
the
chief
still
resounding
with
the
clang
of
bagpipes
and
the
high
applause
of
his
guests
having
gained
the
open
air
by
a
postern
door
they
walked
a
little
way
up
the
wild
bleak
and
narrow
valley
in
which
the
house
was
situated
following
the
course
of
the
stream
that
winded
through
it
in
a
spot
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
castle
two
brooks
which
formed
the
little
river
had
their
junction
the
larger
of
the
two
came
down
the
long
bare
valley
which
extended
apparently
without
any
change
or
elevation
of
character
as
far
as
the
hills
which
formed
its
boundary
permitted
the
eye
to
reach
but
the
other
stream
which
had
its
source
among
the
mountains
on
the
left
hand
of
the
strath
seemed
to
issue
from
a
very
narrow
and
dark
opening
betwixt
two
large
rocks
these
streams
were
different
also
in
character
the
larger
was
placid
and
even
sullen
in
its
course
wheeling
in
deep
eddies
or
sleeping
in
dark
blue
pools
but
the
motions
of
the
lesser
brook
were
rapid
and
furious
issuing
from
between
precipices
like
a
maniac
from
his
confinement
all
foam
and
uproar
it
was
up
the
course
of
this
last
stream
that
waverley
like
a
knight
of
romance
was
conducted
by
the
fair
highland
damsel
his
silent
guide
a
small
path
which
had
been
rendered
easy
in
many
places
for
flora
accommodation
led
him
through
scenery
of
a
very
different
description
from
that
which
he
had
just
quitted
around
the
castle
all
was
cold
bare
and
desolate
yet
tame
even
in
desolation
but
this
narrow
glen
at
so
short
a
distance
seemed
to
open
into
the
land
of
romance
the
rocks
assumed
a
thousand
peculiar
and
varied
forms
in
one
place
a
crag
of
huge
size
presented
its
gigantic
bulk
as
if
to
forbid
the
farther
progress
and
it
was
not
until
he
approached
its
very
base
that
waverley
discerned
the
sudden
and
acute
turn
by
which
the
pathway
wheeled
its
course
around
this
formidable
obstacle
in
another
spot
the
projecting
rocks
from
the
opposite
sides
of
the
chasm
had
approached
so
near
to
each
other
that
two
laid
across
and
covered
with
turf
formed
a
rustic
bridge
at
the
height
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
it
had
no
ledges
and
was
barely
three
feet
in
breadth
while
gazing
at
this
pass
of
peril
which
crossed
like
a
single
black
line
the
small
portion
of
blue
sky
not
intercepted
by
the
projecting
rocks
on
either
side
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
horror
that
waverley
beheld
flora
and
her
attendant
appear
like
inhabitants
of
another
region
propped
as
it
were
in
mid
air
upon
this
trembling
structure
she
stopped
upon
observing
him
below
and
with
an
air
of
graceful
ease
which
made
him
shudder
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him
by
way
of
signal
he
was
unable
from
the
sense
of
dizziness
which
her
situation
conveyed
to
return
the
salute
and
was
never
more
relieved
than
when
the
fair
apparition
passed
on
from
the
precarious
eminence
which
she
seemed
to
occupy
with
so
much
indifference
and
disappeared
on
the
other
side
advancing
a
few
yards
and
passing
under
the
bridge
which
he
had
viewed
with
so
much
terror
the
path
ascended
rapidly
from
the
edge
of
the
brook
and
the
glen
widened
into
a
sylvan
amphitheatre
waving
with
birch
young
oaks
and
hazels
with
here
and
there
a
scattered
the
rocks
now
receded
but
still
showed
their
grey
and
shaggy
crests
rising
among
the
still
higher
rose
eminences
and
peaks
some
bare
some
clothed
with
wood
some
round
and
purple
with
heath
and
others
splintered
into
rocks
and
crags
at
a
short
turning
the
path
which
had
for
some
furlongs
lost
sight
of
the
brook
suddenly
placed
waverley
in
front
of
a
romantic
waterfall
it
was
not
so
remarkable
either
for
great
height
or
quantity
of
water
as
for
the
beautiful
accompaniments
which
made
the
spot
interesting
after
a
broken
cataract
of
about
twenty
feet
the
stream
was
received
in
a
large
natural
basin
filled
to
the
brim
with
water
which
where
the
bubbles
of
the
fall
subsided
was
so
exquisitely
clear
that
although
it
was
of
great
depth
the
eye
could
discern
each
pebble
at
the
bottom
eddying
round
this
reservoir
the
brook
found
its
way
as
if
over
a
broken
part
of
the
ledge
and
formed
a
second
fall
which
seemed
to
seek
the
very
abyss
then
wheeling
out
beneath
from
among
the
smooth
dark
rocks
which
it
had
polished
for
ages
it
wandered
murmuring
down
the
glen
forming
the
stream
up
which
waverley
had
just
ascended
footnote
see
note
the
borders
of
this
romantic
reservoir
corresponded
in
beauty
but
it
was
beauty
of
a
stern
and
commanding
cast
as
if
in
the
act
of
expanding
into
grandeur
mossy
banks
of
turf
were
broken
and
interrupted
by
huge
fragments
of
rock
and
decorated
with
trees
and
shrubs
some
of
which
had
been
planted
under
the
direction
of
flora
but
so
cautiously
that
they
added
to
the
grace
without
diminishing
the
romantic
wildness
of
the
scene
here
like
one
of
those
lovely
forms
which
decorate
the
landscapes
of
poussin
waverley
found
flora
gazing
on
the
waterfall
two
paces
further
back
stood
cathleen
holding
a
small
scottish
harp
the
use
of
which
had
been
taught
to
flora
by
rory
dall
one
of
the
last
harpers
of
the
western
highlands
the
sun
now
stooping
in
the
west
gave
a
rich
and
varied
tinge
to
all
the
objects
which
surrounded
waverley
and
seemed
to
add
more
than
human
brilliancy
to
the
full
expressive
darkness
of
flora
eye
exalted
the
richness
and
purity
of
her
complexion
and
enhanced
the
dignity
and
grace
of
her
beautiful
form
edward
thought
he
had
never
even
in
his
wildest
dreams
imagined
a
figure
of
such
exquisite
and
interesting
loveliness
the
wild
beauty
of
the
retreat
bursting
upon
him
as
if
by
magic
augmented
the
mingled
feeling
of
delight
and
awe
with
which
he
approached
her
like
a
fair
enchantress
of
boiardo
or
ariosto
by
whose
nod
the
scenery
around
seemed
to
have
been
created
an
eden
in
the
wilderness
flora
like
every
beautiful
woman
was
conscious
of
her
own
power
and
pleased
with
its
effects
which
she
could
easily
discern
from
the
respectful
yet
confused
address
of
the
young
soldier
but
as
she
possessed
excellent
sense
she
gave
the
romance
of
the
scene
and
other
accidental
circumstances
full
weight
in
appreciating
the
feelings
with
which
waverley
seemed
obviously
to
be
impressed
and
unacquainted
with
the
fanciful
and
susceptible
peculiarities
of
his
character
considered
his
homage
as
the
passing
tribute
which
a
woman
of
even
inferior
charms
might
have
expected
in
such
a
situation
she
therefore
quietly
led
the
way
to
a
spot
at
such
a
distance
from
the
cascade
that
its
sound
should
rather
accompany
than
interrupt
that
of
her
voice
and
instrument
and
sitting
down
upon
a
mossy
fragment
of
rock
she
took
the
harp
from
cathleen
have
given
you
the
trouble
of
walking
to
this
spot
captain
waverley
both
because
i
thought
the
scenery
would
interest
you
and
because
a
highland
song
would
suffer
still
more
from
my
imperfect
translation
were
i
to
introduce
it
without
its
own
wild
and
appropriate
accompaniments
to
speak
in
the
poetical
language
of
my
country
the
seat
of
the
celtic
muse
is
in
the
mist
of
the
secret
and
solitary
hill
and
her
voice
in
the
murmur
of
the
mountain
stream
he
who
woos
her
must
love
the
barren
rock
more
than
the
fertile
valley
and
the
solitude
of
the
desert
better
than
the
festivity
of
the
hall
few
could
have
heard
this
lovely
woman
make
this
declaration
with
a
voice
where
harmony
was
exalted
by
pathos
without
exclaiming
that
the
muse
whom
she
invoked
could
never
find
a
more
appropriate
representative
but
waverley
though
the
thought
rushed
on
his
mind
found
no
courage
to
utter
it
indeed
the
wild
feeling
of
romantic
delight
with
which
he
heard
the
few
first
notes
she
drew
from
her
instrument
amounted
almost
to
a
sense
of
pain
he
would
not
for
worlds
have
quitted
his
place
by
her
side
yet
he
almost
longed
for
solitude
that
he
might
decipher
and
examine
at
leisure
the
complication
of
emotions
which
now
agitated
his
bosom
flora
had
exchanged
the
measured
and
monotonous
recitative
of
the
bard
for
a
lofty
and
uncommon
highland
air
which
had
been
a
in
former
ages
a
few
irregular
strains
introduced
a
prelude
of
a
wild
and
peculiar
tone
which
harmonised
well
with
the
distant
waterfall

the
soft
sigh
of
the
evening
breeze

the
rustling
leaves
of
an
aspen

overhung

warmly
pressed
waverley
to
remain
for
a
week
or
two
in
order
to
see
a
grand
hunting
party
in
which
he
and
some
other
highland
gentlemen
proposed
to
join
the
charms
of
melody
and
beauty
were
too
strongly
impressed
in
edward
breast
to
permit
his
declining
an
invitation
so
pleasing
it
was
agreed
therefore
that
he
should
write
a
note
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
expressing
his
intention
to
stay
a
fortnight
at
glennaquoich
and
requesting
him
to
forward
by
the
bearer
a
gilly
of
the
chieftain
any
letters
which
might
have
arrived
for
him
this
turned
the
discourse
upon
the
baron
whom
fergus
highly
extolled
as
a
gentleman
and
soldier
his
character
was
touched
with
yet
more
discrimination
by
flora
who
observed
he
was
the
very
model
of
the
old
scottish
cavalier
with
all
his
excellencies
and
peculiarities
is
a
character
captain
waverley
which
is
fast
disappearing
for
its
best
point
was
a
which
was
never
lost
sight
of
till
now
but
in
the
present
time
the
gentlemen
whose
principles
do
not
permit
them
to
pay
court
to
the
existing
government
are
neglected
and
degraded
and
many
conduct
themselves
accordingly
and
like
some
of
the
persons
you
have
seen
at
adopt
habits
and
companions
inconsistent
with
their
birth
and
breeding
the
ruthless
proscription
of
party
seems
to
degrade
the
victims
whom
it
brands
however
unjustly
but
let
us
hope
a
brighter
day
is
approaching
when
a
scottish
country
gentleman
may
be
a
scholar
without
the
pedantry
of
our
friend
the
baron
a
sportsman
without
the
low
habits
of
falconer
and
a
judicious
improver
of
his
property
without
becoming
a
boorish
legged
steer
like
killancureit
thus
did
flora
prophesy
a
revolution
which
time
indeed
has
produced

in
a
manner
very
different
from

had

her
very
soul
is
in
home
and
in
the
discharge
of
all
those
quiet
virtues
of
which
home
is
the
centre
her
husband
will
be
to
her
what
her
father
now
is
the
object
of
all
her
care
solicitude
and
affection
she
will
see
nothing
and
connect
herself
with
nothing
but
by
him
and
through
him
if
he
is
a
man
of
sense
and
virtue
she
will
sympathise
in
his
sorrows
divert
his
fatigue
and
share
his
pleasures
if
she
becomes
the

of
a
churlish
or
negligent

will
suit

i
do
know
by
what
caprice
it
was
that
this
wish
however
jocularly
expressed
rather
jarred
on
edward
feelings
notwithstanding
his
growing
inclination
to
flora
and
his
indifference
to
miss
bradwardine
this
is
one
of
the
inexplicabilities
of
human
nature
which
we
leave
without
comment
brother
answered
flora
regarding
him
steadily
you
have
another
bride
honour
and
the
dangers
you
must
run
in
pursuit
of
her
rival
would
break
poor
rose
heart
with
this
discourse
they
reached
the
castle
and
waverley
soon
prepared
his
despatches
for
as
he
knew
the
baron
was
punctilious
in
such
matters
he
was
about
to
impress
his
billet
with
a
seal
on
which
his
armorial
bearings
were
engraved
but
he
did
not
find
it
at
his
watch
and
thought
he
must
have
left
it
at
he
mentioned
his
loss
borrowing
at
the
same
time
the
family
seal
of
the

said
miss
bean

would
not
life
for
him
in
such
circumstances
answered
her

he
would
never
have
left
the
watch
behind
all
fergus
said
flora
with
every
allowance
i
am
surprised
you
can
countenance
that
man
countenance
him
this
kind
sister
of
mine
would
persuade
you
captain
waverley
that
i
take
what
the
people
of
old
used
to
call
a
steakraid
that
is
a
collop
of
the
foray
or
in
plainer
words
a
portion
of
the
robber
booty
paid
by
him
to
the
laird
or
chief
through
whose
grounds
he
drove
his
prey
o
it
is
certain
that
unless

can
find
some
way
to
charm

general

nickname
me
in
his
own

fergus
must
not
our
guest
be
sensible
that
all
this
is
folly
and
affectation
you
have
men
enough
to
serve
you
without
enlisting
banditti
and
your
own
honour
is
above
taint
why
you
send
this
donald

lean
whom
i
hate
for
his
smoothness
and
duplicity
even
more
than
for
his
rapine
out
of
your

at

no
cause
should
induce
me
to
tolerate
such
a

significantly

know
it
is

my

close
a
dubious

the

captain
waverley
perhaps
you
will
like
better
to
dance
to
them
in
the
hall
than
to
be
deafened
with
their
harmony
without
taking

took

the

and
proceeded
and
closed
the

vohr
edward
at
length
retired
his
mind
agitated
by
a
variety
of
new
and
conflicting
feelings
which
detained
him
from
rest
for
some
time
in
that
not
unpleasing
state
of
mind
in
which
fancy
takes
the
helm
and
the
soul
rather
drifts
passively
along
with
the
rapid
and
confused
tide
of
reflections
than
exerts
itself
to
encounter
systematise
or
examine
them
at
a
late
hour
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
of
flora
chapter
xxiv
a
and
its
consequences
shall
this
be
a
long
or
a
short
chapter
this
is
a
question
in
which
you
gentle
reader
have
no
vote
however
much
you
may
be
interested
in
the
consequences
just
as
you
may
like
myself
probably
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
imposing
a
new
tax
excepting
the
trifling
circumstance
of
being
obliged
to
pay
it
more
happy
surely
in
the
present

though
it
lies
within
my
arbitrary
power
to
extend
my

think
proper
i
can
not
call
you
into
exchequer
if
you
do
not
think
proper
to
read
my
narrative
let
me
therefore
consider
it
is
true
that
the
annals
and
documents
in
my
hands
say
but
little
of
this
highland
chase
but
then
i
can
find
copious
materials
for

there

with

and

for
the

besides
the
particulars
which
may
be
thence
gleaned
for
this
highland
feast
the
splendour
of
which
induced
the
pope
legate
to
dissent
from
an
opinion
which
he
had
hitherto
held
that
scotland
namely
was
the
the
the
latter

but
without
further
tyranny
over
my
readers
or
display
of
the
extent
of
my
own
reading
i
shall
content
myself
with
borrowing
a
single
incident
from
the
memorable
hunting
at
lude
commemorated
in
the
ingenious
gunn
essay
on
the
caledonian
harp
and
so
proceed
in
my
story
with
all
the
brevity
that
my
natural
style
of
composition
partaking
of
what
scholars
call
the
periphrastic
and
ambagitory
and
the
vulgar
the
circumbendibus
will
permit
me
the
solemn
hunting
was
delayed
from
various
causes
for
about
three
weeks
the
interval
was
spent
by
waverley
with
great
satisfaction
at
glennaquoich
for
the
impression
which
flora
had
made
on
his
mind
at
their
first
meeting
grew
daily
stronger
she
was
precisely
the
character
to
fascinate
a
youth
of
romantic
imagination
her
manners
her
language
her
talents
for
poetry
and
music
gave
additional
and
varied
influence
to
her
eminent
personal
charms
even
in
her
hours
of
gaiety
she
was
in
his
fancy
exalted
above
the
ordinary
daughters
of
eve
and
seemed
only
to
stoop
for
an
instant
to
those
topics
of
amusement
and
gallantry
which
others
appear
to
live
for
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
enchantress
while
sport
consumed
the
morning
and
music
and
the
dance
led
on
the
hours
of
evening
waverley
became
daily
more
delighted
with
his
hospitable
landlord
and
more
enamoured
of
his
bewitching
sister
at
length
the
period
fixed
for
the
grand
hunting
arrived
and
waverley
and
the
chieftain
departed
for
the
place
of
rendezvous
which
was
a
day
journey
to
the
northward
of
glennaquoich
fergus
was
attended
on
this
occasion
by
about
three
hundred
of
his
clan
well
armed
and
accoutred
in
their
best
fashion
waverley
complied
so
far
with
the
custom
of
the
country
as
to
adopt
the
trews
he
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
kilt
brogues
and
bonnet
as
the
fittest
dress
for
the
exercise
in
which
he
was
to
be
engaged
and
which
least
exposed
him
to
be
stared
at
as
a
stranger
when
they
should
reach
the
place
of
rendezvous
they
found
on
the
spot
appointed
several
powerful
chiefs
to
all
of
whom
waverley
was
formally
presented
and
by
all
cordially
received
their
vassals
and
clansmen
a
part
of
whose
feudal
duty
it
was
to
attend
on
these
parties
appeared
in
such
numbers
as
amounted
to
a
small
army
these
active
assistants
spread
through
the
country
far
and
near
forming
a
circle
technically
called
the
tinchel
which
gradually
closing
drove
the
deer
in
herds
together
towards
the
glen
where
the
chiefs
and
principal
sportsmen
lay
in
wait
for
them
in
the
meanwhile
these
distinguished
personages
bivouacked
among
the
flowery
heath
wrapped
up
in
their
plaids
a
mode
of
passing
a
summer
night
which
waverley
found
by
no
means
unpleasant
for
many
hours
after
sunrise
the
mountain
ridges
and
passes
retained
their
ordinary
appearance
of
silence
and
solitude
and
the
chiefs
with
their
followers
amused
themselves
with
various
pastimes
in
which
the
joys
of
the
shell
as
ossian
has
it
were
not
forgotten
apart
sate
on
a
hill
retired
probably
as
deeply
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
politics
and
news
as
spirits
in
metaphysical
disquisition
at
length
signals
of
the
approach
of
the
game
were
descried
and
heard
distant
shouts
resounded
from
valley
to
valley
as
the
various
parties
of
highlanders
climbing
rocks
struggling
through
copses
wading
brooks
and
traversing
thickets
approached
more
and
more
near
to
each
other
and
compelled
the
astonished
deer
with
the
other
wild
animals
that
fled
before
them
into
a
narrower
circuit
every
now
and
then
the
report
of
muskets
was
heard
repeated
by
a
thousand
echoes
the
baying
of
the
dogs
was
soon
added
to
the
chorus
which
grew
ever
louder
and
more
loud
at
length
the
advanced
parties
of
the
deer
began
to
show
themselves
and
as
the
stragglers
came
bounding
down
the
pass
by
two
or
three
at
a
time
the
chiefs
showed
their
skill
by
distinguishing
the
fattest
deer
and
their
dexterity
in
bringing
them
down
with
their
guns
fergus
exhibited
remarkable
address
and
edward
was
also
so
fortunate
as
to
attract
the
notice
and
applause
of
the
sportsmen
but
now
the
main
body
of
the
deer
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
glen
compelled
into
a
very
narrow
compass
and
presenting
such
a
formidable
phalanx
that
their
antlers
appeared
at
a
distance
over
the
ridge
of
the
steep
pass
like
a
leafless
grove
their
number
was
very
great
and
from
a
desperate
stand
which
they
made
with
the
tallest
of
the
stags
arranged
in
front
in
a
sort
of
gazing
on
the
group
which
barred
their
passage
down
the
glen
the
more
experienced
sportsmen
began
to
augur
danger
the
work
of
destruction
however
now
commenced
on
all
sides
dogs
and
hunters
were
at
work
and
muskets
and
fusees
resounded
from
every
quarter
the
deer
driven
to
desperation
made
at
length
a
fearful
charge
right
upon
the
spot
where
the
more
distinguished
sportsmen
had
taken
their
stand
the
word
was
given
in
gaelic
to
fling
themselves
upon
their
faces
but
waverley
on
whose
english
ears
the
signal
was
lost
had
almost
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
ignorance
of
the
ancient
language
in
which
it
was
communicated
fergus
observing
his
danger
sprung
up
and
pulled
him
with
violence
to
the
ground
just
as
the
whole
herd
broke
down
upon
them
the
tide
being
absolutely
irresistible
and
wounds
from
a
stag
horn
highly
dangerous
the
activity
of
the
chieftain
may
be
considered
on
this
occasion
as
having
saved
his
guest
life
he
detained
him
with
a
firm
grasp
until
the
whole
herd
of
deer
had
fairly
run
over
them
waverley
then
attempted
to
rise
but
found
that
he
had
suffered
several
very
severe
contusions
and
upon
a
further
examination
discovered
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
violently
footnote
the
thrust
from
the
tynes
or
branches
of
the
horns
was
accounted
far
more
dangerous
than
those
of
the
tusk
if
thou
be
hurt
with
horn
of
stag
it
brings
thee
to
thy
bier
but
barber
hand

boar
hurt
heal
thereof
have
thou
no
fear
this
checked
the
mirth
of
the
meeting
although
the
highlanders
accustomed
to
such
incidents
and
prepared
for
them
had
suffered
no
harm
themselves
a
wigwam
was
erected
almost
in
an
instant
where
edward
was
deposited
on
a
couch
of
heather
the
surgeon
or
he
who
assumed
the
office
appeared
to
unite
the
characters
of
a
leech
and
a
conjuror
he
was
an
old
highlander
wearing
a
venerable
grey
beard
and
having
for
his
sole
garment
a
tartan
frock
the
skirts
of
which
descended
to
the
knee
and
being
undivided
in
front
made
the
vestment
serve
at
once
for
doublet
and
breeches
footnote
this
garb
which
resembled
the
dress
often
put
on
children
in
scotland
called
a
polonie
polonaise
is
a
very
ancient
modification
of
the
highland
garb
it
was
in
fact
the
hauberk
or
shirt
of
mail
only
composed
of
cloth
instead
of
rings
of
armour
he
observed
great
ceremony
in
approaching
edward
and
though
our
hero
was
writhing
with
pain
would
not
proceed
to
any
operation
which
might
assuage
it
until
he
had
perambulated
his
couch
three
times
moving
from
east
to
west
according
to
the
course
of
the
sun
this
which
was
called
making
the
deasil
footnote
old
highlanders
will
still
make
the
deasil
around
those
whom
they
wish
well
to
to
go
round
a
person
in
the
opposite
direction
or
withershins
german
is
unlucky
and
a
sort
of
incantation
both
the
leech
and
the
assistants
seemed
to
consider
as
a
matter
of
the
last
importance
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
cure
and
waverley
whom
pain
rendered
incapable
of
expostulation
and
who
indeed
saw
no
chance
of
its
being
attended
to
submitted
in
silence
after
this
ceremony
was
duly
performed
the
old
esculapius
let
his
patient
blood
with
a
with
great
dexterity
and
proceeded
muttering
all
the
while
to
himself
in
gaelic
to
boil
on
the
fire
certain
herbs
with
which
he
compounded
an
embrocation
he
then
fomented
the
parts
which
had
sustained
injury
never
failing
to
murmur
prayers
or
spells
which
of
the
two
waverley
could
not
distinguish
as
his
ear
only
caught
the
words
and
similar
gibberish
the
fomentation
had
a
speedy
effect
in
alleviating
the
pain
and
swelling
which
our
hero
imputed
to
the
virtue
of
the
herbs
or
the
effect
of
the
chafing
but
which
was
by
the
bystanders
unanimously
ascribed
to
the
spells
with
which
the
operation
had
been
accompanied
edward
was
given
to
understand
that
not
one
of
the
ingredients
had
been
gathered
except
during
the
full
moon
and
that
the
herbalist
had
while
collecting
them
uniformly
recited
a
charm
which
in
english
ran
thus
hail
to
thee
thou
holy
herb
that
sprung
on
holy
ground
all
in
the
mount
olivet
first
wert
thou
found
thou

for
many
a
bruise
and
healest
many
a
wound
in
our
lady
blessed
name
i
take
thee
from
the
ground
footnote
this
metrical
spell
or
something
very
like
it
is
preserved
by
reginald
scott
in
his
work
on
witchcraft
edward
observed
with
some
surprise
that
even
fergus
notwithstanding
his
knowledge
and
education
seemed
to
fall
in
with
the
superstitious
ideas
of
his
countrymen
either
because
he
deemed
it
impolitic
to
affect
scepticism
on
a
matter
of
general
belief
or
more
probably
because
like
most
men
who
do
not
think
deeply
or
accurately
on
such
subjects
he
had
in
his
mind
a
reserve
of
superstition
which
balanced
the
freedom
of
his
expressions
and
practice
upon
other
occasions
waverley
made
no
commentary
therefore
on
the
manner
of
the
treatment
but
rewarded
the
professor
of
medicine
with
a
liberality
beyond
the
utmost
conception
of
his
wildest
hopes
he
uttered
on
the
occasion
so
many
incoherent
blessings
in
gaelic
and
english
that
rather
scandalised
at
the
excess
of
his
acknowledgments
cut
them
short
by
exclaiming
ceud
mile
mhalloich
ort
hundred
thousand
curses
on
you
and
so
pushed
the
helper
of
men
out
of
the
cabin
after
waverley
was
left
alone
the
exhaustion
of
pain
and
fatigue
for
the
whole
day
exercise
had
been
severe
threw
him
into
a
profound
but
yet
a
feverish
sleep
which
he
chiefly
owed
to
an
opiate
draught
administered
by
the
old
highlander
from
some
decoction
of
herbs
in
his
pharmacopoeia
early
the
next
morning
the
purpose
of
their
meeting
being
over
and
their
sports
damped
by
the
untoward
accident
in
which
fergus
and
all
his
friends
expressed
the
greatest
sympathy
it
became
a
question
how
to
dispose
of
the
disabled
sportsman
this
was
settled
by
who
had
a
litter
prepared
of
and

on
the
morrow
they
made
their
biers
of
birch
and

grey

chase
which
was
borne
by
his
people
with
such
caution
and
dexterity
as
renders
it
not
improbable
that
they
may
have
been
the
ancestors
of
some
of
those
sturdy
gael
who
have
now
the
happiness
to
transport
the
belles
of
edinburgh
in
their
to
ten
routs
in
one
evening
when
edward
was
elevated
upon
their
shoulders
he
could
not
help
being
gratified
with
the
romantic
effect
produced
by
the
breaking
up
of
this
sylvan
camp

the
various

assembled
each
at
the

of

and

headed

some
who
had
already
begun
to

were

winding

which
led

the

came

of

to
express
their
anxious
hope
they
might
again

the

of

abridged
the

of
taking
leave
at

his
own
men
being
completely
assembled
and
mustered
commenced
his
march
but
not
towards
the
quarter
from
which
they
had
come
he
gave
edward
to
understand
that
the
greater
part
of
his
followers
now
on
the
field
were
bound
on
a
distant
expedition
and
that
when
he
had
deposited
him
in
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
he
was
sure
would
pay
him
every
attention
he
himself
should
be
under
the
necessity
of
accompanying
them
the
greater
part
of
the
way
but
would
lose
no
time
in
rejoining
his
friend
waverley
was
rather
surprised
that
fergus
had
not
mentioned
this
ulterior
destination
when
they
set
out
upon
the
but
his
situation
did
not
admit
of
many
interrogatories
the
greater
part
of
the
clansmen
went
forward
under
the
guidance
of
old
ballenkeiroch
and
evan
dhu
maccombich
apparently
in
high
spirits
a
few
remained
for
the
purpose
of
escorting
the
chieftain
who
walked
by
the
side
of
edward
litter
and
attended
him
with
the
most
affectionate
assiduity
about
noon
after
a
journey
which
the
nature
of
the
conveyance
the
pain
of
his
bruises
and
the
roughness
of
the
way
rendered
inexpressibly
painful
waverley
was
hospitably
received
into
the
house
of
a
gentleman
related
to
fergus
who
had
prepared
for
him
every
accommodation
which
the
simple
habits
of
living
then
universal
in
the
highlands
put
in
his
power
in
this
person
an
old
man
about
seventy
edward
admired
a
relic
of
primitive
simplicity
he
wore
no
dress
but
what
his
estate
afforded
the
cloth
was
the
fleece
of
his
own
sheep
woven
by
his
own
servants
and
stained
into
tartan
by
the
dyes
produced
from
the
herbs
and
lichens
of
the
hills
around
him
his
linen
was
spun
by
his
daughters
and
maidservants
from
his
own
flax
nor
did
his
table
though
plentiful
and
varied
with
game
and
fish
offer
an
article
but
what
was
of
native
produce
claiming
himself
no
rights
of
clanship
or
vassalage
he
was
fortunate
in
the
alliance
and
protection
of
vich
ian
vohr
and
other
bold
and
enterprising
chieftains
who
protected
him
in
the
quiet
unambitious
life
he
loved
it
is
true
the
youth
born
on
his
grounds
were
often
enticed
to
leave
him
for
the
service
of
his
more
active
friends
but
a
few
old
servants
and
tenants
used
to
shake
their
grey
locks
when
they
heard
their
master
censured
for
want
of
spirit
and
observed
the
wind
is
still
the
shower
falls
soft
this
good
old
man
whose
charity
and
hospitality
were
unbounded
would
have
received
waverley
with
kindness
had
he
been
the
meanest
saxon
peasant
since
his
situation
required
assistance
but
his
attention
to
a
friend
and
guest
of
vich
ian
vohr
was
anxious
and
unremitted
other
embrocations
were
applied
to
the
injured
limb
and
new
spells
were
put
in
practice
at
length
after
more
solicitude
than
was
perhaps
for
the
advantage
of
his
health
fergus
took
farewell
of
edward
for
a
few
days
when
he
said
he
would
return
to
tomanrait
and
hoped
by
that
time
waverley
would
be
able
to
ride
one
of
the
highland
ponies
of
his
landlord
and
in
that
manner
return
to
glennaquoich
the
next
day
when
his
good
old
host
appeared
edward
learned
that
his
friend
had
departed
with
the
dawn
leaving
none
of
his
followers
except
callum
beg
the
sort
of
who
used
to
attend
his
person
and
who
had
now
in
charge
to
wait
upon
waverley
on
asking
his
host
if
he
knew
where
the
chieftain
was
gone
the
old
man
looked
fixedly
at
him
with
something
mysterious
and
sad
in
the
smile
which
was
his
only
reply
waverley
repeated
his
question
to
which
his
host
answered
in
a
proverb
what
sent
the
messengers
to
hell
was
asking
what
they
knew
full
well

should

of
a

he
himself
had
not
communicated

arrived

was

when
fergus
returned
with
about
a
score
of
his
men
he
seemed
in
the
highest
spirits
congratulated
waverley
on
his
progress
towards
recovery
and
finding
he
was
able
to
sit
on

proposed

the

stoutly
by

approached

now
advanced
and
welcoming
waverley
with
much
kindness
expressed
her
regret
for
his
accident
of
which
she
had
already
heard
particulars
and
her
surprise
that
her
brother
should
not
have
taken
better
care
to
put
a
stranger
on
his
guard
against
the
perils
of
the
sport
in
which
he
engaged

edward
easily
exculpated
the
chieftain
who
indeed
at
his
own
personal
risk
had
probably
saved
his
life
this
greeting
over
fergus
said
three
or
four
words
to
his
sister
in
gaelic
the
tears
instantly
sprung
to
her
eyes
but
they
seemed
to
be
tears
of
devotion
and
joy
for
she
looked
up
to
heaven
and
folded
her
hands
as
in
a
solemn
expression
of
prayer
or
gratitude
after
the
pause
of
a
minute
she
presented
to
edward
some
letters
which
had
been
forwarded
from
during
his
absence
and
at
the
same
time
delivered
some
to
her
brother

of

both
gentlemen
retired
to
examine
their
despatches
and
edward
speedily
found
that
those
which
he
had
received
contained
matters
of
very
deep
interest
chapter
xxv
news
from
england
the
letters
which
waverley
had
hitherto
received
from
his
relations
in
england
were
not
such
as
required
any
particular
notice
in
this
narrative
his
father
usually
wrote
to
him
with
the
pompous
affectation
of
one
who
was
too
much
oppressed
by
public
affairs
to
find
leisure
to
attend
to
those
of
his
own
family
now
and
then
he
mentioned
persons
of
rank
in
scotland
to
whom
he
wished
his
son
should
pay
some
attention
but
waverley
hitherto
occupied
by
the
amusements
which
he
had
found
at
and
glennaquoich
dispensed
with
paying
any
attention
to
hints
so
coldly
thrown
out
especially
as
distance
shortness
of
leave
of
absence
and
so
forth
furnished
a
ready
apology
but
latterly
the
burden
of
richard
waverley
paternal
epistles
consisted
in
certain
mysterious
hints
of
greatness
and
influence
which
he
was
speedily
to
attain
and
which
would
ensure
his
son
obtaining
the
most
rapid
promotion
should
he
remain
in
the
military
service
sir
everard
letters
were
of
a
different
tenor
they
were
short
for
the
good
baronet

none
of
your
illimitable
correspondents
whose
manuscript
overflows
the
folds
of
their
large
post
paper
and
leaves
no
room
for
the
seal
but
they
were
kind
and
affectionate
and
seldom
concluded
without
some
allusion
to
our
hero
stud
some
question
about
the
state
of
his
purse
and
a
special
inquiry
after
such
of
his
recruits
as
had
preceded
him
from
aunt
rachel
charged
him
to
remember
his
principles
of
religion
to
take
care
of
his
health

beware
of

without
his
coat
and
above
all
to
wear
flannel
next
to
his
skin
pembroke
only
wrote
to
our
hero
one
letter
but
it
was
of
the
bulk
of
six
epistles
of
these
degenerate
days
containing
in
the
moderate
compass
of
ten
folio
pages
closely
written
a
precis
of
a
supplementary
quarto
manuscript
of
addenda
delenda
et
corrigenda
in
reference
to
the
two
tracts
with
which
he
had
presented
waverley
this
he
considered
as
a
mere
sop
in
the
pan
to
stay
the
appetite
of
edward
curiosity
until
he
should
find
an
opportunity
of
sending
down
the
volume
itself
which
was
much
too
heavy
for
the
post
and
which
he
proposed
to
accompany
with
certain
interesting
pamphlets
lately
published
by
his
friend
in
little
britain
with
whom
he
had
kept
up
a
sort
of
literary
correspondence
in
virtue
of
which
the
library
shelves
of
were
loaded
with
much
trash
and
a
good
round
bill
seldom
summed
in
fewer
than
three
figures
was
yearly
transmitted
in
which
sir
everard
waverley
of
was
marked
to
jonathan
grubbet
bookseller
and
stationer
little
britain
such
had
hitherto
been
the
style
of
the
letters
which
edward
had
received
from
england
but
the
packet
delivered
to
him
at
glennaquoich
was
of
a
different
and
more
interesting
complexion
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
reader
even
were
i
to
insert
the
letters
at
full
length
to
comprehend
the
real
cause
of
their
being
written
without
a
glance
into
the
interior
of
the
british
cabinet
at
the
period
in
question
the
ministers
of
the
day
happened
no
very
singular
event
to
be
divided
into
two
parties
the
weakest
of
which
making
up
by
assiduity
of
intrigue
their
inferiority
in
real
consequence
had
of
late
acquired
some
new
proselytes
and
with
them
the
hope
of
superseding
their
rivals
in
the
favour
of
their
sovereign
and
overpowering
them
in
the
house
of
commons
amongst
others
they
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
practise
upon
richard
waverley
this
honest
gentleman
by
a
grave
mysterious
demeanour
an
attention
to
the
etiquette
of
business
rather
more
than
to
its
essence
a
facility
in
making
long
dull
speeches
consisting
of
truisms
and
commonplaces
hashed
up
with
a
technical
jargon
of
office
which
prevented
the
inanity
of
his
orations
from
being
discovered
had
acquired
a
certain
name
and
credit
in
public
life
and
even
established
with
many
the
character
of
a
profound
politician
none
of
your
shining
orators
indeed
whose
talents
evaporate
in
tropes
of
rhetoric
and
flashes
of
wit
but
one
possessed
of
steady
parts
for
business
which
would
wear
well
as
the
ladies
say
in
choosing
their
silks
and
ought
in
all
reason
to
be
good
for
common
and
use
since
they
were
confessedly
formed
of
no
holiday
texture
this
faith
had
become
so
general
that
the
insurgent
party
in
the
cabinet
of
which
we
have
made
mention
after
sounding
richard
waverley
were
so
satisfied
with
his
sentiments
and
abilities
as
to
propose
that
in
case
of
a
certain
revolution
in
the
ministry
he
should
take
an
ostensible
place
in
the
new
order
of
things
not
indeed
of
the
very
first
rank
but
greatly
higher
in
point
both
of
emolument
and
influence
than
that
which
he
now
enjoyed
there
was
no
resisting
so
tempting
a
proposal
notwithstanding
that
the
great
man
under
whose
patronage
he
had
enlisted
and
by
whose
banner
he
had
hitherto
stood
firm
was
the
principal
object
of
the
proposed
attack
by
the
new
allies
unfortunately
this
fair
scheme
of
ambition
was
blighted
in
the
very
bud
by
a
premature
movement
all
the
official
gentlemen
concerned
in
it
who
hesitated
to
take
the
part
of
a
voluntary
resignation
were
informed
that
the
king
had
no
further
occasion
for
their
services
and
in
richard
waverley
case
which
the
minister
considered
as
aggravated
by
ingratitude
dismissal
was
accompanied
by
something
like
personal
contempt
and
contumely
the
public
and
even
the
party
of
whom
he
shared
the
fall
sympathised
little
in
the
disappointment
of
this
selfish
and
interested
statesman
and
he
retired
to
the
country
under
the
comfortable
reflection
that
he
had
lost
at
the
same
time
character
credit
and
what
he
at
least
equally
deplored
emolument
richard
waverley
letter
to
his
son
upon
this
occasion
was
a
masterpiece
of
its
kind
aristides
himself
could
not
have
made
out
a
harder
case
an
unjust
monarch
and
an
ungrateful
country
were
the
burden
of
each
rounded
paragraph
he
spoke
of
long
services
and
unrequited
sacrifices
though
the
former
had
been
overpaid
by
his
salary
and
nobody
could
guess
in
what
the
latter
consisted
unless
it
were
in
his
deserting
not
from
conviction
but
for
the
lucre
of
gain
the
tory
principles
of
his
family
in
the
conclusion
his
resentment
was
wrought
to
such
an
excess
by
the
force
of
his
own
oratory
that
he
could
not
repress
some
threats
of
vengeance
however
vague
and
impotent
and
finally
acquainted
his
son
with
his
pleasure
that
he
should
testify
his
sense
of
the
he
had
sustained
by
throwing
up
his
commission
as
soon
as
the
letter
reached
him
this
he
said
was
also
his
uncle
desire
as
he
would
himself
intimate
in
due
course
accordingly
the
next
letter
which
edward
opened
was
from
sir
everard
his
brother
disgrace
seemed
to
have
removed
from
his
bosom
all
recollection
of
their
differences
and
remote
as
he
was
from
every
means
of
learning
that
disgrace
was
in
reality
only
the
just
as
well
as
natural
consequence
of
his
own
unsuccessful
intrigues
the
good
but
credulous
baronet
at
once
set
it
down
as
a
new
and
enormous
instance
of
the
injustice
of
the
existing
government
it
was
true
he
said
and
he
must
not
disguise
it
even
from
edward
that
his
father
could
not
have
sustained
such
an
insult
as
was
now
for
the
first
time
offered
to
one
of
his
house
unless
he
had
subjected
himself
to
it
by
accepting
of
an
employment
under
the
present
system
sir
everard
had
no
doubt
that
he
now
both
saw
and
felt
the
magnitude
of
this
error
and
it
should
be
his
sir

business
to
take
care
that
the
cause
of
his
regret
should
not
extend
itself
to
pecuniary
consequences
it
was
enough
for
a
waverley
to
have
sustained
the
public
disgrace
the
patrimonial
injury
could
easily
be
obviated
by
the
head
of
their
family
but
it
was
both
the
opinion
of
richard
waverley
and
his
own
that
edward
the
representative
of
the
family
of
should
not
remain
in
a
situation
which
subjected
him
also
to
such
treatment
as
that
with
which
his
father
had
been
stigmatised
he
requested
his
nephew
therefore
to
take
the
fittest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
speedy
opportunity
of
transmitting
his
resignation
to
the
war
office
and
hinted
moreover
that
little
ceremony
was
necessary
where
so
little
had
been
used
to
his
father
he
sent
multitudinous
greetings
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
a
letter
from
aunt
rachel
spoke
out
even
more
plainly
she
considered
the
disgrace
of
brother
richard
as
the
just
reward
of
his
forfeiting
his
allegiance
to
a
lawful
though
exiled
sovereign
and
taking
the
oaths
to
an
alien
a
concession
which
her
grandfather
sir
nigel
waverley
refused
to
make
either
to
the
roundhead
parliament
or
to
cromwell
when
his
life
and
fortune
stood
in
the
utmost
extremity
she
hoped
her
dear
edward
would
follow
the
footsteps
of
his
ancestors
and
as
speedily
as
possible
get
rid
of
the
badge
of
servitude
to
the
usurping
family
and
regard
the
wrongs
sustained
by
his
father
as
an
admonition
from
heaven
that
every
desertion
of
the
line
of
loyalty
becomes
its
own
punishment
she
also
concluded
with
her
respects
to
bradwardine
and
begged
waverley
would
inform
her
whether
his
daughter
miss
rose
was
old
enough
to
wear
a
pair
of
very
handsome
which
she
proposed
to
send
as
a
token
of
her
affection
the
good
lady
also
desired
to
be
informed
whether
bradwardine
took
as
much
scotch
snuff
and
danced
as
unweariedly
as
he
did
when
he
was
at
about
thirty
years
ago
these
letters
as
might
have
been
expected
highly
excited
waverley
indignation
from
the
desultory
style
of
his
studies
he
had
not
any
fixed
political
opinion
to
place
in
opposition
to
the
movements
of
indignation
which
he
felt
at
his
supposed
wrongs
of
the
real
cause
of
his
disgrace
edward
was
totally
ignorant
nor
had
his
habits
at
all
led
him
to
investigate
the
politics
of
the
period
in
which
he
lived
or
remark
the
intrigues
in
which
his
father
had
been
so
actively
engaged
indeed
any
impressions
which
he
had
accidentally
adopted
concerning
the
parties
of
the
times
were
owing
to
the
society
in
which
he
had
lived
at
of
a
nature
rather
unfavourable
to
the
existing
government
and
dynasty
he
entered
therefore
without
hesitation
into
the
resentful
feeling
of
the
relations
who
had
the
best
title
to
dictate
his
conduct
and
not
perhaps
the
less
willingly
when
he
remembered
the
tedium
of
his
quarters
and
the
inferior
figure
which
he
had
made
among
the
officers
of
his
regiment
if
he
could
have
had
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
it
would
have
been
decided
by
the
following
letter
from
his
commanding
officer
which
as
it
is
very
short
shall
be
inserted
verbatim
sir
having
carried
somewhat
beyond
the
line
of
my
duty
an
indulgence
which
even
the
lights
of
nature
and
much
more
those
of
christianity
direct
towards
errors
which
may
arise
from
youth
and
inexperience
and
that
altogether
without
effect
i
am
reluctantly
compelled
at
the
present
crisis
to
use
the
only
remaining
remedy
which
is
in
my
power
you
are
therefore
hereby
commanded
to
repair
to
the
headquarters
of
the
regiment
within
three
days
after
the
date
of
this
letter
if
you
shall
fail
to
do
so
i
must
report
you
to
the
war
office
as
absent
without
leave
and
also
take
other
steps
which
will
be
disagreeable
to
you
as
well
as
to
sir
your
obedient
servant
gardiner
commanding
the
regt
dragoons
edward
blood
boiled
within
him
as
he
read
this
letter
he
had
been
accustomed
from
his
very
infancy
to
possess
in
a
great
measure
the
disposal
of
his
own
time
and
thus
acquired
habits
which
rendered
the
rules
of
military
discipline
as
unpleasing
to
him
in
this
as
they
were
in
some
other
respects
an
idea
that
in
his
own
case
they
would
not
be
enforced
in
a
very
rigid
manner
had
also
obtained
full
possession
of
his
mind
and
had
hitherto
been
sanctioned
by
the
indulgent
conduct
of
his
neither
had
anything
occurred
to
his
knowledge
that
should
have
induced
his
commanding
officer
without
any
other
warning
than
the
hints
we
noticed
at
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
chapter
so
suddenly
to
assume
a
harsh
and
as
edward
deemed
it
so
insolent
a
tone
of
dictatorial
authority
connecting
it
with
the
letters
he
had
just
received
from
his
family
he
could
not
but
suppose
that
it
was
designed
to
make
him
feel
in
his
present
situation
the
same
pressure
of
authority
which
had
been
exercised
in
his
case
and
that
the
whole
was
a
concerted
scheme
to
depress
and
degrade
every
member
of
the
waverley
family
without
a
pause
therefore
edward
wrote
a
few
cold
lines
thanking
his
for
past
civilities
and
expressing
regret
that
he
should
have
chosen
to
efface
the
remembrance
of
them
by
assuming
a
different
tone
towards
him
the
strain
of
his
letter
as
well
as
what
he
edward
conceived
to
be
his
duty
in
the
present
crisis
called
upon
him
to
lay
down
his
commission
and
he
therefore
inclosed
the
formal
resignation
of
a
situation
which
subjected
him
to
so
unpleasant
a
correspondence
and
requested
colonel
gardiner
would
have
the
goodness
to
forward
it
to
the
proper
authorities
having
finished
this
magnanimous
epistle
he
felt
somewhat
uncertain
concerning
the
terms
in
which
his
resignation
ought
to
be
expressed
upon
which
subject
he
resolved
to
consult
fergus
it
may
be
observed
in
passing
that
the
bold
and
prompt
habits
of
thinking
acting
and
speaking
which
distinguished
this
young
chieftain
had
given
him
a
considerable
ascendency
over
the
mind
of
waverley
endowed
with
at
least
equal
powers
of
understanding
and
with
much
finer
genius
edward
yet
stooped
to
the
bold
and
decisive
activity
of
an
intellect
which
was
sharpened
by
the
habit
of
acting
on
a
preconceived
and
regular
system
as
well
as
by
extensive
knowledge
of
the
world
when
edward
found
his
friend
the
latter
had
still
in
his
hand
the
newspaper
which
he
had
perused
and
advanced
to
meet
him
with
the
embarrassment
of
one
who
has
unpleasing
news
to
communicate
your
letters
captain
waverley
confirm
the
unpleasing
information
which
i
find
in
this
paper
he
put
the
paper
into
his
hand
where
his
father
disgrace
was
registered
in
the
most
bitter
terms
transferred
probably
from
some
london
journal
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
was
this
remarkable
innuendo
understand
that
this
same
richard
who
hath
done
all
this
is
not
the
only
example
of
the
wavering
honour
of
see
the
gazette
of
this
day
with
hurried
and
feverish
apprehension
our
hero
turned
to
the
place
referred
to
and
found
therein
recorded
waverley
captain
in
regiment
dragoons
superseded
for
absence
without
leave
and
in
the
list
of
military
promotions
referring
to
the
same
regiment
he
discovered
this
farther
article
julius
butler
to
be
captain
vice
edward
waverley
superseded
our
hero
bosom
glowed
with
the
resentment
which
undeserved
and
apparently
premeditated
insult
was
calculated
to
excite
in
the
bosom
of
one
who
had
aspired
after
honour
and
was
thus
wantonly
held
up
to
public
scorn
and
disgrace
upon
comparing
the
date
of
his
colonel
letter
with
that
of
the
article
in
the
gazette
he
perceived
that
his
threat
of
making
a
report
upon
his
absence
had
been
literally
fulfilled
and
without
inquiry
as
it
seemed
whether
edward
had
either
received
his
summons
or
was
disposed
to
comply
with
it
the
whole
therefore
appeared
a
formed
plan
to
degrade
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
the
idea
of
its
having
succeeded
filled
him
with
such
bitter
emotions
that
after
various
attempts
to
conceal
them
he
at
length
threw
himself
into
ivor
arms
and
gave
vent
to
tears
of
shame
and
indignation
it
was
none
of
this
chieftain
faults
to
be
indifferent
to
the
wrongs
of
his
friends
and
for
edward
independent
of
certain
plans
with
which
he
was
connected
he
felt
a
deep
and
sincere
interest
the
proceeding
appeared
as
extraordinary
to
him
as
it
had
done
to
edward
he
indeed
knew
of
more
motives
than
waverley
was
privy
to
for
the
peremptory
order
that
he
should
join
his
regiment
but
that
without
further
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
a
necessary
delay
the
commanding
officer
in
contradiction
to
his
known
and
established
character
should
have
proceeded
in
so
harsh
and
unusual
a
manner
was
a
mystery
which
he
could
not
penetrate
he
soothed
our
hero
however
to
the
best
of
his
power
and
began
to
turn
his
thoughts
on
revenge
for
his
insulted
honour
edward
eagerly
grasped
at
the
idea
you
carry
a
message
for
me
to
colonel
gardiner
my
dear
fergus
and
oblige
me
for
ever
fergus
paused
is
an
act
of
friendship
which
you
should
command
could
it
be
useful
or
lead
to
the
righting
your
honour
but
in
the
present
case
i
doubt
if
your
commanding
officer
would
give
you
the
meeting
on
account
of
his
having
taken
measures
which
however
harsh
and
exasperating
were
still
within
the
strict
bounds
of
his
duty
besides
gardiner
is
a
precise
huguenot
and
has
adopted
certain
ideas
about
the
sinfulness
of
such
rencontres
from
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
him
depart
especially
as
his
courage
is
beyond
all
suspicion
and
besides
i
i
to
say
the
truth
i
dare
not
at
this
moment
for
some
very
weighty
reasons
go
near
any
of
the
military
quarters
or
garrisons
belonging
to
this
government
am
i
said
waverley
sit
down
quiet
and
contented
under
the
injury
i
have
received
will
i
never
advise
my
friend
replied
i
would
have
vengeance
to
fall
on
the
head
not
on
the
hand
on
the
tyrannical
and
oppressive
government
which
designed
and
directed
these
premeditated
and
reiterated
insults
not
on
the
tools
of
office
which
they
employed
in
the
execution
of
the
injuries
they
aimed
at
you
the
government
said
waverley
replied
the
impetuous
highlander
the
usurping
house
of
hanover
whom
your
grandfather
would
no
more
have
served
than
he
would
have
taken
wages
of
gold
from
the
great
fiend
of
hell
since
the
time
of
my
grandfather
two
generations
of
this
dynasty
have
possessed
the
throne
said
edward
coolly
replied
the
chieftain
because
we
have
passively
given
them
so
long
the
means
of
showing
their
native
character
because
both
you
and
i
myself
have
lived
in
quiet
submission
have
even
truckled
to
the
times
so
far
as
to
accept
commissions
under
them
and
thus
have
given
them
an
opportunity
of
disgracing
us
publicly
by
resuming
them
are
we
not
on
that
account
to
resent
injuries
which
our
fathers
only
apprehended
but
which
we
have
actually
sustained
or
is
the
cause
of
the
unfortunate
stuart
family
become
less
just
because
their
title
has
devolved
upon
an
heir
who
is
innocent
of
the
charges
of
misgovernment
brought
against
his
father
do
you
remember
the
lines
of
your
favourite
poet
had
richard
unconstrain
resign
the
throne
a
king
can
give
no
more
than
is
his
own
the
title
stood
entail
had
richard
had
a
son
you
see
my
dear
waverley
i
can
quote
poetry
as
well
as
flora
and
you
but
come
clear
your
moody
brow
and
trust
to
me
to
show
you
an
honourable
road
to
a
speedy
and
glorious
revenge
let
us
seek
flora
who
perhaps
has
more
news
to
tell
us
of
what
has
occurred
during
our
absence
she
will
rejoice
to
hear
that
you
are
relieved
of
your
servitude
but
first
add
a
postscript
to
your
letter
marking
the
time
when
you
received
this
calvinistical
first
summons
and
express
your
regret
that
the
hastiness
of
his
proceedings
prevented
your
anticipating
them
by
sending
your
resignation
then
let
him
blush
for
his
injustice
the
letter
was
sealed
accordingly
covering
a
formal
resignation
of
the
commission
and
despatched
it
with
some
letters
of
his
own
by
a
special
messenger
with
charge
to
put
them
into
the
nearest
in
the
lowlands
chapter
xxvi
an
eclaircissement
the
hint
which
the
chieftain
had
thrown
out
respecting
flora
was
not
unpremeditated
he
had
observed
with
great
satisfaction
the
growing
attachment
of
waverley
to
his
sister
nor
did
he
see
any
bar
to
their
union
excepting
the
situation
which
father
held
in
the
ministry
and
edward
own
commission
in
the
army
of
george
ii
these
obstacles
were
now
removed
and
in
a
manner
which
apparently
paved
the
way
for
the
son
becoming
reconciled
to
another
allegiance
in
every
other
respect
the
match
would
be
most
eligible
the
safety
happiness
and
honourable
provision
of
his
sister
whom
he
dearly
loved
appeared
to
be
ensured
by
the
proposed
union
and
his
heart
swelled
when
he
considered
how
his
own
interest
would
be
exalted
in
the
eyes
of
the
to
whom
he
had
dedicated
his
service
by
an
alliance
with
one
of
those
ancient
powerful
and
wealthy
english
families
of
the
steady
cavalier
faith
to
awaken
whose
decayed
attachment
to
the
stuart
family
was
now
a
matter
of
such
vital
importance
to
the
stuart
cause
nor
could
fergus
perceive
any
obstacle
to
such
a
scheme
waverley
attachment
was
evident
and
as
his
person
was
handsome
and
his
taste
apparently
coincided
with
her
own
he
anticipated
no
opposition
on
the
part
of
flora
indeed
between
his
ideas
of
patriarchal
power
and
those
which
he
had
acquired
in
france
respecting
the
disposal
of
females
in
marriage
any
opposition
from
his
sister
dear
as
she
was
to
him
would
have
been
the
last
obstacle
on
which
he
would
have
calculated
even
had
the
union
been
less
eligible
influenced
by
these
feelings
the
chief
now
led
waverley
in
quest
of
miss
not
without
the
hope
that
the
present
agitation
of
his
guest
spirits
might
give
him
courage
to
cut
short
what
fergus
termed
the
romance
of
the
courtship
they
found
flora
with
her
faithful
attendants
una
and
cathleen
busied
in
preparing
what
appeared
to
waverley
to
be
white
bridal
favours
disguising
as
well
as
he
could
the
agitation
of
his
mind
waverley
asked
for
what
joyful
occasion
miss
made
such
ample
preparation
is
for
fergus
bridal
she
said
smiling
said
edward
has
kept
his
secret
well
i
hope
he
will
allow
me
to
be
his
is
a
man
office
but
not
yours
as
beatrice
says
retorted
flora
who
is
the
fair
lady
may
i
be
permitted
to
ask
miss
ivor
not
i
tell
you
long
since
that
fergus
wooed
no
bride
but
honour
answered
flora
am
i
then
incapable
of
being
his
assistant
and
counsellor
in
the
pursuit
of
honour
said
our
hero
colouring
deeply
i
rank
so
low
in
your
opinion
from
it
captain
waverley
i
would
to
god
you
were
of
our
determination
and
made
use
of
the
expression
which
displeased
you
solely
because
you
are
not
of
our
quality
but
stand
against
us
as
an
enemy
time
is
past
sister
said
fergus
you
may
wish
edward
waverley
no
longer
captain
joy
of
being
freed
from
the
slavery
to
an
usurper
implied
in
that
sable
and
emblem
said
waverley
undoing
the
cockade
from
his
hat
has
pleased
the
king
who
bestowed
this
badge
upon
me
to
resume
it
in
a
manner
which
leaves
me
little
reason
to
regret
his
service
god
for
that
cried
the
enthusiast
o
that
they
may
be
blind
enough
to
treat
every
man
of
honour
who
serves
them
with
the
same
indignity
that
i
may
have
less
to
sigh
for
when
the
struggle
approaches
now
sister
said
the
chieftain
his
cockade
with
one
of
a
more
lively
colour
i
think
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
ladies
of
yore
to
arm
and
send
forth
their
knights
to
high
achievement
replied
the
lady
the
knight
adventurer
had
well
weighed
the
justice
and
the
danger
of
the
cause
fergus
waverley
is
just
now
too
much
agitated
by
feelings
of
recent
emotion
for
me
to
press
upon
him
a
resolution
of
consequence
waverley
felt
half
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
adopting
the
badge
of
what
was
by
the
majority
of
the
kingdom
esteemed
rebellion
yet
he
could
not
disguise
his
chagrin
at
the
coldness
with
which
flora
parried
her
brother
hint
i
perceive
thinks
the
knight
unworthy
of
her
encouragement
and
favour
said
he
somewhat
bitterly
so
waverley
she
replied
with
great
sweetness
should
i
refuse
my
brother
valued
friend
a
boon
which
i
am
distributing
to
his
whole
clan
most
willingly
would
i
enlist
every
man
of
honour
in
the
cause
to
which
my
brother
has
devoted
himself
but
fergus
has
taken
his
measures
with
his
eyes
open
his
life
has
been
devoted
to
this
cause
from
his
cradle
with
him
its
call
is
sacred
were
it
even
a
summons
to
the
tomb
but
how
can
i
wish
you
waverley
so
new
to
the
world
so
far
from
every
friend
who
might
advise
and
ought
to
influence
you
in
a
moment
too
of
sudden
pique
and
indignation
how
can
i
wish
you
to
plunge
yourself
at
once
into
so
desperate
an
enterprise
fergus
who
did
not
understand
these
delicacies
strode
through
the
apartment
biting
his
lip
and
then
with
a
constrained
smile
said
sister
i
leave
you
to
act
your
new
character
of
mediator
between
the
elector
of
hanover
and
the
subjects
of
your
lawful
sovereign
and
benefactor
and
left
the
room
there
was
a
painful
pause
which
was
at
length
broken
by
miss
ivor
brother
is
unjust
she
said
he
can
bear
no
interruption
that
seems
to
thwart
his
loyal
zeal
do
you
not
share
his
ardour
asked
waverley
i
not
answered
flora
knows
mine
exceeds
his
if
that
be
possible
but
i
am
not
like
him
rapt
by
the
bustle
of
military
preparation
and
the
infinite
detail
necessary
to
the
present
undertaking
beyond
consideration
of
the
grand
principles
of
justice
and
truth
on
which
our
enterprise
is
grounded
and
these
i
am
certain
can
only
be
furthered
by
measures
in
themselves
true
and
just
to
operate
upon
your
present
feelings
my
dear
waverley
to
induce
you
to
an
irretrievable
step
of
which
you
have
not
considered
either
the
justice
or
the
danger
is
in
my
poor
judgment
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
flora
said
edward
taking
her
hand
much
do
i
need
such
a
monitor
better
one
by
far
said
flora
gently
withdrawing
her
hand
waverley
will
always
find
in
his
own
bosom
when
he
will
give
its
small
still
voice
leisure
to
be
heard
miss
i
dare
not
hope
it
a
thousand
circumstances
of
fatal
have
made
me
the
creature
rather
of
imagination
than
reason
durst
i
but
hope
could
i
but
think
that
you
would
deign
to
be
to
me
that
affectionate
that
condescending
friend
who
would
strengthen
me
to
redeem
my
errors
my
future
life
my
dear
sir
now
you
carry
your
joy
at
escaping
the
hands
of
a
jacobite
recruiting
officer
to
an
unparalleled
excess
of
gratitude
dear
flora
trifle
with
me
no
longer
you
can
not
mistake
the
meaning
of
those
feelings
which
i
have
almost
involuntarily
expressed
and
since
i
have
broken
the
barrier
of
silence
let
me
profit
by
my
audacity
or
may
i
with
your
permission
mention
to
your
brother
for
the
world
mr
waverley
am
i
to
understand
said
edward
there
any
fatal
bar
has
any
prepossession
sir
answered
flora
owe
it
to
myself
to
say
that
i
never
yet
saw
the
person
on
whom
i
thought
with
reference
to
the
present
subject
shortness
of
our
acquaintance
perhaps
if
miss
will
deign
to
give
me
time
have
not
even
that
excuse
captain
waverley
character
is
so
open
is
in
short
of
that
nature
that
it
can
not
be
misconstrued
either
in
its
strength
or
its
weakness
for
that
weakness
you
despise
me
said
edward
me
waverley
and
remember
it
is
but
within
this
half
hour
that
there
existed
between
us
a
barrier
of
a
nature
to
me
insurmountable
since
i
never
could
think
of
an
officer
in
the
service
of
the
elector
of
hanover
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
casual
acquaintance
permit
me
then
to
arrange
my
ideas
upon
so
unexpected
a
topic
and
in
less
than
an
hour
i
will
be
ready
to
give
you
such
reasons
for
the
resolution
i
shall
express
as
may
be
satisfactory
at
least
if
not
pleasing
to
you
so
saying
flora
withdrew
leaving
waverley
to
meditate
upon
the
manner
in
which
she
had
received
his
addresses
ere
he
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
believe
his
suit
had
been
acceptable
or
no
fergus
the
apartment
a
la
mort
waverley
he
cried
down
with
me
to
the
court
and
you
shall
see
a
sight
worth
all
the
tirades
of
your
romances
an
hundred
firelocks
my
friend
and
as
many
broadswords
just
arrived
from
good
friends
and
two
or
three
hundred
stout
fellows
almost
fighting
which
shall
first
possess
them
but
let
me
look
at
you
closer
why
a
true
highlander
would
say
you
had
been
blighted
by
an
evil
eye
or
can
it
be
this
silly
girl
that
has
thus
blanked
your
spirit
never
mind
her
dear
edward
the
wisest
of
her
sex
are
fools
in
what
regards
the
business
of
life
my
good
friend
answered
waverley
that
i
can
charge
against
your
sister
is
that
she
is
too
sensible
too
reasonable
that
be
all
i
ensure
you
for
a
against
the
mood
lasting
hours
no
woman
was
ever
steadily
sensible
for
that
period
and
i
will
engage
if
that
will
please
you
flora
shall
be
as
unreasonable
as
any
of
her
sex
you
must
learn
my
dear
edward
to
consider
women
en
mousquetaire
so
saying
he
seized
waverley
arm
and
dragged
him
off
to
review
his
military
preparations
chapter
xxvii
upon
the
same
subject
fergus
had
too
much
tact
and
delicacy
to
renew
the
subject
which
he
had
interrupted
his
head
was
or
appeared
to
be
so
full
of
guns
broadswords
bonnets
canteens
and
tartan
hose
that
waverley
could
not
for
some
time
draw
his
attention
to
any
other
topic
you
to
take
the
field
so
soon
fergus
he
asked
you
are
making
all
these
martial
preparations
we
have
settled
that
you
go
with
me
you
shall
know
all
but
otherwise
the
knowledge
might
rather
be
prejudicial
to
you
are
you
serious
in
your
purpose
with
such
inferior
forces
to
rise
against
an
established
government
it
is
mere
frenzy
faire
a
don
antoine
i
shall
take
good
care
of
myself
we
shall
at
least
use
the
compliment
of
conan
who
never
got
a
stroke
but
he
gave
one
i
would
not
however
continued
the
chieftain
you
think
me
mad
enough
to
stir
till
a
favourable
opportunity
i
will
not
slip
my
dog
before
the
game
afoot
but
once
more
will
you
join
with
us
and
you
shall
know
all
can
i
said
waverley
who
have
so
lately
held
that
commission
which
is
now
posting
back
to
those
that
gave
it
my
accepting
it
implied
a
promise
of
fidelity
and
an
acknowledgment
of
the
legality
of
the
government
rash
promise
answered
fergus
not
a
steel
handcuff
it
may
be
shaken
off
especially
when
it
was
given
under
deception
and
has
been
repaid
by
insult
but
if
you
can
not
immediately
make
up
your
mind
to
a
glorious
revenge
go
to
england
and
ere
you
cross
the
tweed
you
will
hear
tidings
that
will
make
the
world
ring
and
if
sir
everard
be
the
gallant
old
cavalier
i
have
heard
him
described
by
some
of
our
honest
gentlemen
of
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifteen
he
will
find
you
a
better
and
a
better
cause
than
you
have
lost
your
sister
fergus
hyperbolical
fiend
replied
the
chief
laughing
vexest
thou
this
man
thou
of
nothing
but
of
ladies
be
serious
my
dear
friend
said
waverley
feel
that
the
happiness
of
my
future
life
must
depend
upon
the
answer
which
miss
shall
make
to
what
i
ventured
to
tell
her
this
morning
is
this
your
very
sober
earnest
said
fergus
more
gravely
are
we
in
the
land
of
romance
and
fiction
earnest
undoubtedly
how
could
you
suppose
me
jesting
on
such
a
subject
in
very
sober
earnest
answered
his
friend
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
so
highly
do
i
think
of
flora
that
you
are
the
only
man
in
england
for
whom
i
would
say
so
much
but
before
you
shake
my
hand
so
warmly
there
is
more
to
be
considered
your
own
family
will
they
approve
your
connecting
yourself
with
the
sister
of
a
highland
beggar
uncle
situation
said
waverley
general
opinions
and
his
uniform
indulgence
entitle
me
to
say
that
birth
and
personal
qualities
are
all
he
would
look
to
in
such
a
connection
and
where
can
i
find
both
united
in
such
excellence
as
in
your
sister
nowhere
cela
va
sans
dire
replied
fergus
with
a
smile
your
father
will
expect
a
father
prerogative
in
being
consulted
but
his
late
breach
with
the
ruling
powers
removes
all
apprehension
of
objection
on
his
part
especially
as
i
am
convinced
that
my
uncle
will
be
warm
in
my
cause
perhaps
said
fergus
make
obstacles
though
we
are
not
bigotted
catholics
grandmother
was
of
the
church
of
rome
and
her
religion
was
never
objected
to
by
my
family
do
not
think
of
my
friends
dear
fergus
let
me
rather
have
your
influence
where
it
may
be
more
necessary
to
remove
obstacles
i
mean
with
your
lovely
sister
lovely
sister
replied
fergus
her
loving
brother
is
very
apt
to
have
a
pretty
decisive
will
of
her
own
by
which
in
this
case
you
must
be
ruled
but
you
shall
not
want
my
interest
nor
my
counsel
and
in
the
first
place
i
will
give
you
one
hint
loyalty
is
her
ruling
passion
and
since
she
could
spell
an
english
book
she
has
been
in
love
with
the
memory
of
the
gallant
captain
wogan
who
renounced
the
service
of
the
usurper
cromwell
to
join
the
standard
of
charles
ii
marched
a
handful
of
cavalry
from
london
to
the
highlands
to
join
middleton
then
in
arms
for
the
king
and
at
length
died
gloriously
in
the
royal
cause
ask
her
to
show
you
some
verses
she
made
on
his
history
and
fate
they
have
been
much
admired
i
assure
you
the
next
point
is
i
think
i
saw
flora
go
up
towards
the
waterfall
a
short
time
since
follow
man
follow
do
allow
the
garrison
time
to
strengthen
its
purposes
of
resistance
alerte
a
la
muraille
seek
flora
out
and
learn
her
decision
as
soon
as
you
can
and
cupid
go
with
you
while
i
go
to
look
over
belts
and
waverley
ascended
the
glen
with
an
anxious
and
throbbing
heart
love
with
all
its
romantic
train
of
hopes
fears
and
wishes
was
mingled
with
other
feelings
of
a
nature
less
easily
defined
he
could
not
but
remember
how
much
this
morning
had
changed
his
fate
and
into
what
a
complication
of
perplexity
it
was
likely
to
plunge
him
sunrise
had
seen
him
possessed
of
an
esteemed
rank
in
the
honourable
profession
of
arms
his
father
to
all
appearance
rapidly
rising
in
the
favour
of
his
sovereign
all
this
had
passed
away
like
a
dream
he
himself
was
dishonoured
his
father
disgraced
and
he
had
become
involuntarily
the
confidant
at
least
if
not
the
accomplice
of
plans
dark
deep
and
dangerous
which
must
infer
either
the
subversion
of
the
government
he
had
so
lately
served
or
the
destruction
of
all
who
had
participated
in
them
should
flora
even
listen
to
his
suit
favourably
what
prospect
was
there
of
its
being
brought
to
a
happy
termination
amid
the
tumult
of
an
impending
insurrection
or
how
could
he
make
the
selfish
request
that
she
should
leave
fergus
to
whom
she
was
so
much
attached
and
retiring
with
him
to
england
wait
as
a
distant
spectator
the
success
of
her
brother
undertaking
or
the
ruin
of
all
his
hopes
and
fortunes
or
on
the
other
hand
to
engage
himself
with
no
other
aid
than
his
single
arm
in
the
dangerous
and
precipitate
counsels
of
the
chieftain
to
be
whirled
along
by
him
the
partaker
of
all
his
desperate
and
impetuous
motions
renouncing
almost
the
power
of
judging
or
deciding
upon
the
rectitude
or
prudence
of
his
actions
this
was
no
pleasing
prospect
for
the
secret
pride
of
waverley
to
stoop
to
and
yet
what
other
conclusion
remained
saving
the
rejection
of
his
addresses
by
flora
an
alternative
not
to
be
thought
of
in
the
present
state
of
his
feelings
with
anything
short
of
mental
agony
pondering
the
doubtful
and
dangerous
prospect
before
him
he
at
length
arrived
near
the
cascade
where
as
fergus
had
augured
he
found
flora
seated
she
was
quite
alone
and
as
soon
as
she
observed
his
approach
she
rose
and
came
to
meet
him
edward
attempted
to
say
something
within
the
verge
of
ordinary
compliment
and
conversation
but
found
himself
unequal
to
the
task
flora
seemed
at
first
equally
embarrassed
but
recovered
herself
more
speedily
and
an
unfavourable
augury
for
waverley
suit
was
the
first
to
enter
upon
the
subject
of
their
last
interview
is
too
important
in
every
point
of
view
waverley
to
permit
me
to
leave
you
in
doubt
on
my
sentiments
not
speak
them
speedily
said
waverley
much
agitated
they
are
such
as
i
fear
from
your
manner
i
must
not
dare
to
anticipate
let
time
let
my
future
conduct
let
your
influence
me
waverley
said
flora
her
complexion
a
little
heightened
but
her
voice
firm
and
composed
should
incur
my
own
heavy
censure
did
i
delay
expressing
my
sincere
conviction
that
i
can
never
regard
you
otherwise
than
as
a
valued
friend
i
should
do
you
the
highest
injustice
did
i
conceal
my
sentiments
for
a
moment
i
see
i
distress
you
and
i
grieve
for
it
but
better
now
than
later
and
o
better
a
thousand
times
waverley
that
you
should
feel
a
present
momentary
disappointment
than
the
long
and
griefs
which
attend
a
rash
and
marriage
god
exclaimed
waverley
should
you
anticipate
such
consequences
from
a
union
where
birth
is
equal
where
fortune
is
favourable
where
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
the
tastes
are
similar
where
you
allege
no
preference
for
another
where
you
even
express
a
favourable
opinion
of
him
whom
you
reject
waverley
i
have
that
favourable
opinion
answered
flora
so
strongly
that
though
i
would
rather
have
been
silent
on
the
grounds
of
my
resolution
you
shall
command
them
if
you
exact
such
a
mark
of
my
esteem
and
confidence
she
sat
down
upon
a
fragment
of
rock
and
waverley
placing
himself
near
her
anxiously
pressed
for
the
explanation
she
offered
dare
hardly
she
said
you
the
situation
of
my
feelings
they
are
so
different
from
those
usually
ascribed
to
young
women
at
my
period
of
life
and
i
dare
hardly
touch
upon
what
i
conjecture
to
be
the
nature
of
yours
lest
i
should
give
offence
where
i
would
willingly
administer
consolation
for
myself
from
my
infancy
till
this
day
i
have
had
but
one
wish
the
restoration
of
my
royal
benefactors
to
their
rightful
throne
it
is
impossible
to
express
to
you
the
devotion
of
my
feelings
to
this
single
subject
and
i
will
frankly
confess
that
it
has
so
occupied
my
mind
as
to
exclude
every
thought
respecting
what
is
called
my
own
settlement
in
life
let
me
but
live
to
see
the
day
of
that
happy
restoration
and
a
highland
cottage
a
french
convent
or
an
english
palace
will
be
alike
indifferent
to
me
dearest
flora
how
is
your
enthusiastic
zeal
for
the
exiled
family
inconsistent
with
my
happiness
you
seek
or
ought
to
seek
in
the
object
of
your
attachment
a
heart
whose
principal
delight
should
be
in
augmenting
your
domestic
felicity
and
returning
your
affection
even
to
the
height
of
romance
to
a
man
of
less
keen
sensibility
and
less
enthusiastic
tenderness
of
disposition
flora
might
give
content
if
not
happiness
for
were
the
irrevocable
words
spoken
never
would
she
be
deficient
in
the
duties
which
she
vowed
why
why
miss
should
you
think
yourself
a
more
valuable
treasure
to
one
who
is
less
capable
of
loving
of
admiring
you
than
to
me
because
the
tone
of
our
affections
would
be
more
in
unison
and
because
his
more
blunted
sensibility
would
not
require
the
return
of
enthusiasm
which
i
have
not
to
bestow
but
you
waverley
would
for
ever
refer
to
the
idea
of
domestic
happiness
which
your
imagination
is
capable
of
painting
and
whatever
fell
short
of
that
ideal
representation
would
be
construed
into
coolness
and
indifference
while
you
might
consider
the
enthusiasm
with
which
i
regarded
the
success
of
the
royal
family
as
defrauding
your
affection
of
its
due
return
other
words
miss
you
can
not
love
me
said
her
suitor
dejectedly
could
esteem
you
waverley
as
much
perhaps
more
than
any
man
i
have
ever
seen
but
i
can
not
love
you
as
you
ought
to
be
loved
o
do
not
for
your
own
sake
desire
so
hazardous
an
experiment
the
woman
whom
you
marry
ought
to
have
affections
and
opinions
moulded
upon
yours
her
studies
ought
to
be
your
studies
her
wishes
her
feelings
her
hopes
her
fears
should
all
mingle
with
yours
she
should
enhance
your
pleasures
share
your
sorrows
and
cheer
your
melancholy
why
will
not
you
miss
who
can
so
well
describe
a
happy
union
why
will
not
you
be
yourself
the
person
you
describe
it
possible
you
do
not
yet
comprehend
me
answered
flora
i
not
told
you
that
every
keener
sensation
of
my
mind
is
bent
exclusively
towards
an
event
upon
which
indeed
i
have
no
power
but
those
of
my
earnest
prayers
might
not
the
granting
the
suit
i
solicit
said
waverley
too
earnest
on
his
purpose
to
consider
what
he
was
about
to
say
advance
the
interest
to
which
you
have
devoted
yourself
my
family
is
wealthy
and
powerful
inclined
in
principles
to
the
stuart
race
and
should
a
favourable
opportunity
favourable
opportunity
said
flora
somewhat
scornfully
in
principles
can
such
lukewarm
adherence
be
honourable
to
yourselves
or
gratifying
to
your
lawful
sovereign
think
from
my
present
feelings
what
i
should
suffer
when
i
held
the
place
of
member
in
a
family
where
the
rights
which
i
hold
most
sacred
are
subjected
to
cold
discussion
and
only
deemed
worthy
of
support
when
they
shall
appear
on
the
point
of
triumphing
without
it
doubts
quickly
replied
waverley
unjust
as
far
as
concerns
myself
the
cause
that
i
shall
assert
i
dare
support
through
every
danger
as
undauntedly
as
the
boldest
who
draws
sword
in
its
behalf
that
answered
flora
can
not
doubt
for
a
moment
but
consult
your
own
good
sense
and
reason
rather
than
a
prepossession
hastily
adopted
probably
only
because
you
have
met
a
young
woman
possessed
of
the
usual
accomplishments
in
a
sequestered
and
romantic
situation
let
your
part
in
this
great
and
perilous
drama
rest
upon
conviction
and
not
on
a
hurried
and
probably
a
temporary
feeling
waverley
attempted
to
reply
but
his
words
failed
him
every
sentiment
that
flora
had
uttered
vindicated
the
strength
of
his
attachment
for
even
her
loyalty
although
wildly
enthusiastic
was
generous
and
noble
and
disdained
to
avail
itself
of
any
indirect
means
of
supporting
the
cause
to
which
she
was
devoted
after
walking
a
little
way
in
silence
down
the
path
flora
thus
resumed
the
word
more
waverley
ere
we
bid
farewell
to
this
topic
for
ever
and
forgive
my
boldness
if
that
word
have
the
air
of
advice
my
brother
fergus
is
anxious
that
you
should
join
him
in
his
present
enterprise
but
do
not
consent
to
this
you
could
not
by
your
single
exertions
further
his
success
and
you
would
inevitably
share
his
fall
if
it
be
god
pleasure
that
fall
he
must
your
character
would
also
suffer
irretrievably
let
me
beg
you
will
return
to
your
own
country
and
having
publicly
freed
yourself
from
every
tie
to
the
usurping
government
i
trust
you
will
see
cause
and
find
opportunity
to
serve
your
injured
sovereign
with
effect
and
stand
forth
as
your
loyal
ancestors
at
the
head
of
your
natural
followers
and
adherents
a
worthy
representative
of
the
house
of
waverley
should
i
be
so
happy
as
thus
to
distinguish
myself
might
i
not
hope
my
interruption
said
flora
present
time
only
is
ours
and
i
can
but
explain
to
you
with
candour
the
feelings
which
i
now
entertain
how
they
might
be
altered
by
a
train
of
events
too
favourable
perhaps
to
be
hoped
for
it
were
in
vain
even
to
conjecture
only
be
assured
waverley
that
after
my
brother
honour
and
happiness
there
is
none
which
i
shall
more
sincerely
pray
for
than
for
yours
with
these
words
she
parted
from
him
for
they
were
now
arrived
where
two
paths
separated
waverley
reached
the
castle
amidst
a
medley
of
conflicting
passions
he
avoided
any
private
interview
with
fergus
as
he
did
not
find
himself
able
either
to
encounter
his
raillery
or
reply
to
his
solicitations
the
wild
revelry
of
the
feast
for
kept
open
table
for
his
clan
served
in
some
degree
to
stun
reflection
when
their
festivity
was
ended
he
began
to
consider
how
he
should
again
meet
miss
after
the
painful
and
interesting
explanation
of
the
morning
but
flora
did
not
appear
fergus
whose
eyes
flashed
when
he
was
told
by
cathleen
that
her
mistress
designed
to
keep
her
apartment
that
evening
went
himself
in
quest
of
her
but
apparently
his
remonstrances
were
in
vain
for
he
returned
with
a
heightened
complexion
and
manifest
symptoms
of
displeasure
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
on
without
any
allusion
on
the
part
either
of
fergus
or
waverley
to
the
subject
which
engrossed
the
reflections
of
the
latter
and
perhaps
of
both
when
retired
to
his
own
apartment
edward
endeavoured
to
sum
up
the
business
of
the
day
that
the
repulse
he
had
received
from
flora
would
be
persisted
in
for
the
present
there
was
no
doubt
but
could
he
hope
for
ultimate
success
in
case
circumstances
permitted
the
renewal
of
his
suit
would
the
enthusiastic
loyalty
which
at
this
animating
moment
left
no
room
for
a
softer
passion
survive
at
least
in
its
engrossing
force
the
success
or
the
failure
of
the
present
political
machinations
and
if
so
could
he
hope
that
the
interest
which
she
had
acknowledged
him
to
possess
in
her
favour
might
be
improved
into
a
warmer
attachment
he
taxed
his
memory
to
recall
every
word
she
had
used
with
the
appropriate
looks
and
gestures
which
had
enforced
them
and
ended
by
finding
himself
in
the
same
state
of
uncertainty
it
was
very
late
before
sleep
brought
relief
to
the
tumult
of
his
mind
after
the
most
painful
and
agitating
day
which
he
had
ever
passed
chapter
xxviii
a
letter
from
in
the
morning
when
waverley
troubled
reflections
had
for
some
time
given
way
to
repose
there
came
music
to
his
dreams
but
not
the
voice
of
selma
he
imagined
himself
transported
back
to
veolan
and
that
he
heard
davie
gellatley
singing
in
the
court
those
matins
which
used
generally
to
be
the
first
sounds
that
disturbed
his
repose
while
a
guest
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
the
notes
which
suggested
this
vision
continued
and
waxed
louder
until
edward
awoke
in
earnest
the
illusion
however
did
not
seem
entirely
dispelled
the
apartment
was
in
the
fortress
of
lan
nan
chaistel
but
it
was
still
the
voice
of
davie
gellatley
that
made
the
following
lines
resound
under
the
window
my
heart
in
the
highlands
my
heart
is
not
here
my
heart
in
the
highlands
the
deer
the
wild
deer
and
following
the
roe
my
heart
in
the
highlands
wherever
i
go
footnote
these
lines
form
the
burden
of
an
old
song
to
which
burns
wrote
additional
verses
curious
to
know
what
could
have
determined
gellatley
on
an
excursion
of
such
unwonted
extent
edward
began
to
dress
himself
in
all
haste
during
which
operation
the
minstrelsy
of
davie
changed
its
tune
more
than
once
there
nought
in
the
highlands
but
syboes
and
leeks
and
callants
gaun
wanting
the
breeks
wanting
the
breeks
and
without
hose
and
shoon
but
we
the
breeks
when
king
jamie
comes
hame
footnote
these
lines
are
also
ancient
and
i
believe
to
the
tune
of
we
never
hae
peace
till
jamie
comes
hame
to
which
burns
likewise
wrote
some
verses
by
the
time
waverley
was
dressed
and
had
issued
forth
david
had
associated
himself
with
two
or
three
of
the
numerous
highland
loungers
who
always
graced
the
gates
of
the
castle
with
their
presence
and
was
capering
and
dancing
full
merrily
in
the
doubles
and
full
career
of
a
scotch
foursome
reel
to
the
music
of
his
own
whistling
in
this
double
capacity
of
dancer
and
musician
he
continued
until
an
idle
piper
who
observed
his
zeal
obeyed
the
unanimous
call
of
seid
suas
blow
up
and
relieved
him
from
the
latter
part
of
his
trouble
young
and
old
then
mingled
in
the
dance
as
they
could
find
partners
the
appearance
of
waverley
did
not
interrupt
david
exercise
though
he
contrived
by
grinning
nodding
and
throwing
one
or
two
inclinations
of
the
body
into
the
graces
with
which
he
performed
the
highland
fling
to
convey
to
our
hero
symptoms
of
recognition
then
while
busily
employed
in
setting
whooping
all
the
while
and
snapping
his
fingers
over
his
head
he
of
a
sudden
prolonged
his
until
it
brought
him
to
the
place
where
edward
was
standing
and
still
keeping
time
to
the
music
like
harlequin
in
a
pantomime
he
thrust
a
letter
into
our
hero
hand
and
continued
his
saltation
without
pause
or
intermission
edward
who
perceived
that
the
address
was
in
retired
to
peruse
it
leaving
the
faithful
bearer
to
continue
his
exercise
until
the
piper
or
he
should
be
tired
out
the
contents
of
the
letter
greatly
surprised
him
it
had
originally
commenced
with
sir
but
these
words
had
been
carefully
erased
and
the
monosyllable
substituted
in
their
place
the
rest
of
the
contents
shall
be
given
in
rose
own
language
i
fear
i
am
using
an
improper
freedom
by
intruding
upon
you
yet
i
can
not
trust
to
any
one
else
to
let
you
know
some
things
which
have
happened
here
with
which
it
seems
necessary
you
should
be
acquainted
forgive
me
if
i
am
wrong
in
what
i
am
doing
for
alas
waverley
i
have
no
better
advice
than
that
of
my
own
feelings
my
dear
father
is
gone
from
this
place
and
when
he
can
return
to
my
assistance
and
protection
god
alone
knows
you
have
probably
heard
that
in
consequence
of
some
troublesome
news
from
the
highlands
warrants
were
sent
out
for
apprehending
several
gentlemen
in
these
parts
and
among
others
my
dear
father
in
spite
of
all
my
tears
and
entreaties
that
he
would
surrender
himself
to
the
government
he
joined
with
falconer
and
some
other
gentlemen
and
they
have
all
gone
northwards
with
a
body
of
about
forty
horsemen
so
i
am
not
so
anxious
concerning
his
immediate
safety
as
about
what
may
follow
afterwards
for
these
troubles
are
only
beginning
but
all
this
is
nothing
to
you
waverley
only
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
learn
that
my
father
has
escaped
in
case
you
happen
to
have
heard
that
he
was
in
danger
the
day
after
my
father
went
off
there
came
a
party
of
soldiers
to
and
behaved
very
rudely
to
bailie
macwheeble
but
the
officer
was
very
civil
to
me
only
said
his
duty
obliged
him
to
search
for
arms
and
papers
my
father
had
provided
against
this
by
taking
away
all
the
arms
except
the
old
useless
things
which
hung
in
the
hall
and
he
had
put
all
his
papers
out
of
the
way
but
o
waverley
how
shall
i
tell
you
that
they
made
strict
inquiry
after
you
and
asked
when
you
had
been
at
and
where
you
now
were
the
officer
is
gone
back
with
his
party
but
a
officer
and
four
men
remain
as
a
sort
of
garrison
in
the
house
they
have
hitherto
behaved
very
well
as
we
are
forced
to
keep
them
in
but
these
soldiers
have
hinted
as
if
on
your
falling
into
their
hands
you
would
be
in
great
danger
i
can
not
prevail
on
myself
to
write
what
wicked
falsehoods
they
said
for
i
am
sure
they
are
falsehoods
but
you
will
best
judge
what
you
ought
to
do
the
party
that
returned
carried
off
your
servant
prisoner
with
your
two
horses
and
everything
that
you
left
at
i
hope
god
will
protect
you
and
that
you
will
get
safe
home
to
england
where
you
used
to
tell
me
there
was
no
military
violence
nor
fighting
among
clans
permitted
but
everything
was
done
according
to
an
equal
law
that
protected
all
who
were
harmless
and
innocent
i
hope
you
will
exert
your
indulgence
as
to
my
boldness
in
writing
to
you
where
it
seems
to
me
though
perhaps
erroneously
that
your
safety
and
honour
are
concerned
i
am
sure
at
least
i
think
my
father
would
approve
of
my
writing
for
rubrick
is
fled
to
his
cousin
at
the
duchran
to
to
be
out
of
danger
from
the
soldiers
and
the
whigs
and
bailie
macwheeble
does
not
like
to
meddle
he
says
in
other
men
concerns
though
i
hope
what
may
serve
my
father
friend
at
such
a
time
as
this
can
not
be
termed
improper
interference
farewell
captain
waverley
i
shall
probaby
never
see
you
more
for
it
would
be
very
improper
to
wish
you
to
call
at
just
now
even
if
these
men
were
gone
but
i
will
always
remember
with
gratitude
your
kindness
in
assisting
so
poor
a
scholar
as
myself
and
your
attentions
to
my
dear
dear
father
i
remain
your
obliged
servant
rose
comyne
bradwardine
i
hope
you
will
send
me
a
line
by
david
gellatley
just
to
say
you
have
received
this
and
that
you
will
take
care
of
yourself
and
forgive
me
if
i
entreat
you
for
your
own
sake
to
join
none
of
these
unhappy
cabals
but
escape
as
fast
as
possible
to
your
own
fortunate
country
my
compliments
to
my
dear
flora
and
to
glennaquoich
is
she
not
as
handsome
and
accomplished
as
i
have
described
her
thus
concluded
the
letter
of
rose
bradwardine
the
contents
of
which
both
surprised
and
affected
waverley
that
the
baron
should
fall
under
the
suspicions
of
government
in
consequence
of
the
present
stir
among
the
partisans
of
the
house
of
stuart
seemed
only
the
natural
consequence
of
his
political
predilections
but
how
he
himself
should
have
been
involved
in
such
suspicions
conscious
that
until
yesterday
he
had
been
free
from
harbouring
a
thought
against
the
prosperity
of
the
reigning
family
seemed
inexplicable
both
at
and
glennaquoich
his
hosts
had
respected
his
engagements
with
the
existing
government
and
though
enough
passed
by
accidental
innuendo
that
might
induce
him
to
reckon
the
baron
and
the
chief
among
those
disaffected
gentlemen
who
were
still
numerous
in
scotland
yet
until
his
own
connection
with
the
army
had
been
broken
off
by
the
resumption
of
his
commission
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
nourished
any
immediate
or
hostile
attempts
against
the
present
establishment
still
he
was
aware
that
unless
he
meant
at
once
to
embrace
the
proposal
of
fergus
it
would
deeply
concern
him
to
leave
the
suspicious
neighbourhood
without
delay
and
repair
where
his
conduct
might
undergo
a
satisfactory
examination
upon
this
he
the
rather
determined
as
flora
advice
favoured
his
doing
so
and
because
he
felt
inexpressible
repugnance
at
the
idea
of
being
accessary
to
the
plague
of
civil
war
whatever
were
the
original
rights
of
the
stuarts
calm
reflection
told
him
that
omitting
the
question
how
far
james
the
second
could
forfeit
those
of
his
posterity
he
had
according
to
the
united
voice
of
the
whole
nation
justly
forfeited
his
own
since
that
period
four
monarchs
had
reigned
in
peace
and
glory
over
britain
sustaining
and
exalting
the
character
of
the
nation
abroad
and
its
liberties
at
home
reason
asked
was
it
worth
while
to
disturb
a
government
so
long
settled
and
established
and
to
plunge
a
kingdom
into
all
the
miseries
of
civil
war
for
the
purpose
of
replacing
upon
the
throne
the
descendants
of
a
monarch
by
whom
it
had
been
wilfully
forfeited
if
on
the
other
hand
his
own
final
conviction
of
the
goodness
of
their
cause
or
the
commands
of
his
father
or
uncle
should
recommend
to
him
allegiance
to
the
stuarts
still
it
was
necessary
to
clear
his
own
character
by
showing
that
he
had
not
as
seemed
to
be
falsely
insinuated
taken
any
step
to
this
purpose
during
his
holding
the
commission
of
the
reigning
monarch
the
affectionate
simplicity
of
rose
and
her
anxiety
for
his
safety
his
sense
too
of
her
unprotected
state
and
of
the
terror
and
actual
dangers
to
which
she
might
be
exposed
made
an
impression
upon
his
mind
and
he
instantly
wrote
to
thank
her
in
the
kindest
terms
for
her
solicitude
on
his
account
to
express
his
earnest
good
wishes
for
her
welfare
and
that
of
her
father
and
to
assure
her
of
his
own
safety
the
feelings
which
this
task
excited
were
speedily
lost
in
the
necessity
which
he
now
saw
of
bidding
farewell
to
flora
perhaps
for
ever
the
pang
attending
this
reflection
was
inexpressible
for
her
elevation
of
character
her
to
the
cause
which
she
had
embraced
united
to
her
scrupulous
rectitude
as
to
the
means
of
serving
it
had
vindicated
to
his
judgment
the
choice
adopted
by
his
passions
but
time
pressed
calumny
was
busy
with
his
fame
and
every
hour
delay
increased
the
power
to
injure
it
his
departure
must
be
instant
with
this
determination
he
sought
out
fergus
and
communicated
to
him
the
contents
of
rose
letter
with
his
own
resolution
instantly
to
go
to
edinburgh
and
put
into
the
hands
of
some
one
or
other
of
those
persons
of
influence
to
whom
he
had
letters

broken
remarks
edward
made
no

his

indeed
received
them

his

footnote
the
sanguine
jacobites
during
the
eventful
years
kept
up
the
spirits
of

party
by
the
rumour
of
descents
from

on

of

thus

under
the
painful
and
yet
not
altogether
embittered
feelings
which
separation
and
uncertainty
produce
in
the
mind
of
a
youthful
lover
i
am
not
sure
if
the
ladies
understand
the
full
value
of
the
influence
of
absence
nor
do
i
think
it
wise
to
teach
it
them
lest
like
the
clelias
and
mandanes
of
yore
they
should
resume
the
humour
of
sending
their
lovers
into
banishment
distance
in
truth
produces
in
idea
the
same
effect
as
in
real
perspective
objects
are
softened
and
rounded
and
rendered
doubly
graceful
the
harsher
and
more
ordinary
points
of
character
are
mellowed
down
and
those
by
which
it
is
remembered
are
the
more
striking
outlines
that
mark
sublimity
grace
or
beauty
there
are
mists
too
in
the
mental
as
well
as
the
natural
horizon
to
conceal
what
is
less
pleasing
in
distant
objects
and
there
are
happy
lights
to
stream
in
full
glory
upon
those
points
which
can
profit
by
brilliant
illumination
waverley
forgot
flora
prejudices
in
her
magnanimity
and
almost
pardoned
her
indifference
towards
his
affection
when
he
recollected
the
grand
and
decisive
object
which
seemed
to
fill
her
whole
soul
she
whose
sense
of
duty
so
wholly
engrossed
her
in
the
cause
of
a
benefactor
what
would
be
her
feelings
in
favour
of
the
happy
individual
who
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
awaken
them
then
came
the
doubtful
question
whether
he
might
not
be
that
happy
man
a
question
which
fancy
endeavoured
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
by
conjuring
up
all
she
had
said
in
his
praise
with
the
addition
of
a
comment
much
more
flattering
than
the
text
warranted
all
that
was
commonplace
all
that
belonged
to
the
world
was
melted
away
and
obliterated
in
those
dreams
of
imagination
which
only
remembered
with
advantage
the
points
of
grace
and
dignity
that
distinguished
flora
from
the
generality
of
her
sex
not
the
particulars
which
she
held
in
common
with
them
edward
was
in
short
in
the
fair
way
of
creating
a
goddess
out
of
a
accomplished
and
beautiful
young
woman
and
the
time
was
wasted
in
until
at
the
descent
of
a
steep
hill
he
saw
beneath
him
the
of
the
highland
politeness
of
callum
beg
there
are
few
nations
by
the
way
who
can
boast
of
so
much
natural
politeness
as
the
highlanders
footnote
the
highlander
in
former
times
had
always
a
high
idea
of
his
own
gentility
and
was
anxious
to
impress
the
same
upon
those
with
whom
he
conversed
his
language
abounded
in
the
phrases
of
courtesy
and
compliment
and
the
habit
of
carrying
arms
and
mixing
with
those
who
did
so
made
it
particularly
desirable
they
should
use
cautious
politeness
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
the
highland
civility
of
his
attendant
had
not
permitted
him
to
disturb
the
reveries
of
our
hero
but
observing
him
rouse
himself
at
the
sight
of
the
village
callum
pressed
closer
to
his

the

page
that
he
would

as
he
now
distinguished
not
indeed
the
ringing
of
bells
but
the
tinkling
of
something
like
a
hammer
against
the
side
of
an
old
mossy
green
inverted

hung
in
an
open

they
were
received
by
mine
host
a
tall
thin
puritanical
figure
who
seemed
to
debate
with
himself
whether
he
ought
to
give
shelter
to
those
who
travelled
on
such
a
day
reflecting
however
in
all
probability
that
he
possessed
the
power
of
mulcting
them
for
this
irregularity
a
penalty

escape

not

a

the

of
a

then
as

called

waverley
thought
he
had
misunderstood
his
meaning
he
gazed
in
his
face
and
discovered
in
callum
very
handsome
though
embrowned
features
just
the
degree
of
roguish
malice
with
which
a
lad
of
the
same
age
in

would
have
brought

edward
saw
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
argument
and
therefore
contented
himself
with
enjoining
callum
to
lay
aside
all
practices
against
the
person
of
ebenezer
cruickshanks
in
which
injunction
the
page
seemed
to
acquiesce
with
an
air
of
great
indifference

here
a

the

from
the
chief
contained
flora
lines
on
the
fate
of
captain
wogan
whose
enterprising
character
is
so
well
drawn
by
clarendon
he
had
originally
engaged
in
the
service
of
the
parliament
but
had
abjured
that
party
upon
the
execution
of
charles
i
and
upon
hearing
that
the
royal
standard
was
set
up
by
the
earl
of
glencairn
and
general
middleton
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
took
leave
of
charles
ii
who
was
then
at
paris
passed
into
england
assembled
a
body
of
cavaliers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
and
traversed
the
kingdom
which
had
been
so
long
under
domination
of
the
usurper
by
marches
conducted
with
such
skill
dexterity
and
spirit
that
he
safely
united
his
handful
of
horsemen
with
the
body
of
highlanders
then
in
arms
after
several
months
of
desultory
warfare
in
which
wogan
skill
and
courage
gained
him
the
highest
reputation
he
had
the
misfortune
to
be
wounded
in
a
dangerous
manner
and
no
surgical
assistance
being
within
reach
he
terminated
his
short
but
glorious
career
there
were
obvious
reasons
why
the
politic
chieftain
was
desirous
to
place
the
example
of
this
young
hero
under
the
eye
of
waverley
with
whose
romantic
disposition
it
coincided
so
peculiarly
but
his
letter
turned
chiefly
upon
some
trifling
commissions
which
waverley
had
promised
to
execute
for
him
in
england
and
it
was
only
toward
the
conclusion
that
edward
found
these
words
owe
flora
a
grudge
for
refusing
us
her
company
yesterday
and
as
i
am
giving
you
the
trouble
of
reading
these
lines
in
order
to
keep
in
your
memory
your
promise
to
procure
me
the

from
london
i
will
enclose
her
verses
on
the
grave
of
wogan
this
i
know
will
tease
her
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
her
more
in
love
with
the
memory
of
that
dead
hero
than
she
is
likely
to
be
with
any
living
one
unless
he
shall
tread
a
similar
path
but
english
squires
of
our
day
keep

their

or

the
losses
of

neither
invoke
them
to

their

nor
shelter

let
me
hope
for
one
brilliant
exception
in
a
dear
friend
to
whom
i
would
most
gladly
give

merit
of

poetry
the
enthusiasm
which
it
intimated
was
well
calculated
to
make
a
corresponding
impression
upon
her
lover
the
lines
were
read
read
again
then
deposited
in
waverley
bosom
then
again
drawn
out
and
read
line
by
line
in
a
low
and
smothered
voice
and
with
frequent
pauses
which
prolonged
the
mental
treat
as
an
epicure
protracts
by
sipping
slowly
the
enjoyment
of
a
delicious
beverage
the
entrance
of
cruickshanks
with
the
sublunary
articles
of
dinner
and
wine
hardly
interrupted
this
pantomime
of
affectionate
enthusiasm
at
length
the
tall
ungainly
figure
and
ungracious
visage
of
ebenezer
presented
themselves
the
upper
part
of
his
form
notwithstanding
the
season
required
no
such
defence
was
shrouded
in
a
large
belted
over
his
under
habiliments
and
crested
with
a
huge
cowl
of
the
same
stuff
which
when
drawn
over
the
head
and
hat
completely
overshadowed
both
and
being
buttoned
beneath
the
chin
was
called
a
his
hand
grasped
a
huge
garnished
with
brassmounting
his
thin
legs
tenanted
a
pair
of
gambadoes
fastened
at
the
sides
with
rusty
clasps
thus
accoutred
he
stalked
into
the
midst
of
the
apartment
and
announced
his
errand
in
brief
phrase
horses
are
ready
go
with
me
yourself
then
landlord
do
as
far
as
perth
where
ye
may
be
supplied
with
a
guide
to
embro
as
your
occasions
shall
require
thus
saying
he
placed
under
waverley
eye
the
bill
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
at
the
same
time
filled
a
glass
of
wine
and
drank
devoutly
to
a
blessing
on
their
journey
waverley
stared
at
the
man
impudence
but
as
their
connection
was
to
be
short
and
promised
to
be
convenient
he
made
no
observation
upon
it
and
having
paid
his
reckoning
expressed
his
intention
to
depart
immediately
he
mounted
dermid
accordingly
and
sallied
forth
from
the
golden
candlestick
followed
by
the
puritanical
figure
we
have
described
after
he
had
at
the
expense
of
some
time
and
difficulty
and
by
the
assistance
of
a
or
structure
of
masonry
erected
for
the
convenience
in
front
of
the
house
elevated
his
person
to
the
back
of
a
phantom
of
a
on
which
waverley
portmanteau
was
deposited
our
hero
though
not
in
a
very
gay
humour
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
the
appearance
of
his
new
squire
and
at
imagining
the
astonishment
which
his
person
and
equipage
would
have
excited
at
edward
tendency
to
mirth
did
not
escape
mine
host
of
the
candlestick
who
conscious
of
the
cause
infused
a
double
portion
of
souring
into
the
pharisaical
leaven
of
his
countenance
and
resolved
internally
that
in
one
way
or
other
the
young
should
pay
dearly
for
the
contempt
with
which
he
seemed
to
regard
him
callum
also
stood
at
the
gate
and
enjoyed
with
undissembled
glee
the
ridiculous
figure
of
cruickshanks
as
waverley
passed
him
he
pulled
off
his
hat
respectfully
and
approaching
his
stirrup
bade
him
heed
the
auld
whig
deevil
played
him
nae
cantrip
waverley
once
more
thanked
and
bade
him
farewell
and
then
rode
briskly
onward
not
sorry
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
the
shouts
of
the
children
as
they
beheld
old
ebenezer
rise
and
sink
in
his
stirrups
to
avoid
the
concussions
occasioned
by
a
hard
trot
upon
a
street
the
village
of
was
soon
several
miles
behind
him
chapter
xxx
shows
that
the
loss
of
a
horse
shoe
may
be
a
serious
inconvenience
the
manner
and
air
of
waverley
but
above
all
the
glittering
contents
of
his
purse
and
the
indifference
with
which
he
seemed
to
regard
them
somewhat
overawed
his
companion
and
deterred
him
from
making
any
attempts
to
enter
upon
conversation
his
own
reflections
were
moreover
agitated
by
various
surmises
and
by
plans
of
with
which
these
were
intimately
connected
the
travellers
journeyed
therefore
in
silence
until
it
was
interrupted
by
the
annunciation
on
the
part
of
the
guide
that
his
had
lost
a
shoe
which
doubtless
his
honour
would
consider
it
was
his
part
to
replace
this
was
what
lawyers
call
a
fishing
question
calculated
to
ascertain
how
far
waverley
was
disposed
to
submit
to
petty
imposition
part
to
replace
your
horse
shoe
you
rascal
said
waverley
mistaking
the
purport
of
the
intimation
answered
cruickshanks
there
was
no
preceese
clause
to
that
effect
it
canna
be
expected
that
i
am
to
pay
for
the
casualties
whilk
may
befall
the
puir

while
in
your

nathless
if
your
honour
you
mean
i
am
to
pay
the
farrier
but
where
shall
we
find
one
rejoiced
at
discerning
there
would
be
no
objection
made
on
the
part
of
his
temporary
master
cruickshanks
assured
him
that
cairnvreckan
a
village
which
they
were
about
to
enter
was
happy
in
an
excellent
blacksmith
as
he
was
a
professor
he
would
drive
a
nail
for
no
man
on
the
sabbath
or
unless
it
were
in
a
case
of
absolute
necessity
for
which
he
always
charged
sixpence
each
shoe
the
most
important
part
of
this
communication
in
the
opinion
of
the
speaker
made
a
very
slight
impression
on
the
hearer
who
only
internally
wondered
what
college
this
veterinary
professor
belonged
to
not
aware
that
the
word
was
used
to
denote
any
person
who
pretended
to
uncommon
sanctity
of
faith
and
manner
as
they
entered
the
village
of
cairnvreckan
they
speedily
distinguished
the
smith
house
being
also
a
public
it
was
two
stories
high
and
proudly
reared
its
crest
covered
with
grey
slate
above
the
thatched
hovels
by
which
it
was
surrounded
the
adjoining
smithy
betokened
none
of
the
sabbatical
silence
and
repose
which
ebenezer
had
augured
from
the
sanctity
of
his
friend
on
the
contrary
hammer
clashed
and
anvil
rang
the
bellows
groaned
and
the
whole
apparatus
of
vulcan
appeared
to
be
in
full
activity
nor
was
the
labour
of
a
rural
and
pacific
nature
the
master
smith
benempt
as
his
sign
intimated
john
mucklewrath
with
two
assistants
toiled
busily
in
arranging
repairing
and
furbishing
old
muskets
pistols
and
swords
which
lay
scattered
around
his
workshop
in
military
confusion
the
open
shed
containing
the
forge
was
crowded
with
persons
who
came
and
went
as
if
receiving
and
communicating
important
news
and
a
single
glance
at
the
aspect
of
the
people
who
traversed
the
street
in
haste
or
stood
assembled
in
groups
with
eyes
elevated
and
hands
uplifted
announced
that
some
extraordinary
intelligence
was
agitating
the
public
mind
of
the
municipality
of
cairnvreckan
is
some
news
said
mine
host
of
the
candlestick
pushing
his
visage
and
nag
rudely
forward
into
the
crowd
is
some
news
and
if
it
please
my
creator
i
will
forthwith
obtain
speirings
thereof
waverley
with
better
regulated
curiosity
than
his
attendant
dismounted
and
gave
his
horse
to
a
boy
who
stood
idling
near
it
arose
perhaps
from
the
shyness
of
his
character
in
early
youth
that
he
felt
dislike
at
applying
to
a
stranger
even
for
casual
information
without
previously
glancing
at
his
physiognomy
and
appearance
while
he
looked
about
in
order
to
select
the
person
with
whom
he
would
most
willingly
hold
communication
the
buzz
around
saved
him
in
some
degree
the
trouble
of
interrogatories
the
names
of
lochiel
clanronald
glengarry
and
other
distinguished
highland
chiefs
among
whom
vich
ian
vohr
was
repeatedly
mentioned
were
as
familiar
in
men
mouths
as
household
words
and
from
the
alarm
generally
expressed
he
easily
conceived
that
their
descent
into
the
lowlands
at
the
head
of
their
armed
tribes
had
either
already
taken
place
or
was
instantly
apprehended

all
speed

to

in

the

rested
on

says
ye
drunken
what
may
your
name
be
sir
quoth
mucklewrath
is
of
no
consequence
to
you
my
friend
provided
i
pay
your
labour
it
may
be
of
consequence
to
the
state
sir
replied
an
old
farmer
smelling
strongly
of
whisky
and
i
doubt
we
maun
delay
your
journey
till
you
have
seen
the
laird
certainly
said
waverley
haughtily
find
it
both
difficult
and
dangerous
to
detain
me
unless
you
can
produce
some
proper
authority
there
was
a
pause
and
a
whisper
among
the
crowd
murray
lewis
gordon
the
chevalier
himsell
such
were
the
surmises
that
passed
hurriedly
among
them
and
there
was
obviously
an
increased
disposition
to
resist
waverley
departure
he
attempted
to
argue
mildly
with
them
but
his
voluntary
ally
mucklewrath
broke
in
upon
and
drowned
his
expostulations
taking
his
part
with
an
abusive
violence
which
was
all
set
down
to
edward
account
by
those
on
whom
it
was
bestowed
stop
ony
gentleman
that
the
prince
freend
for
she
too
though
with
other
feelings
had
adopted
the
general
opinion
respecting
waverley
daur
ye
to
touch
him
spreading
abroad
her
long
and
muscular
fingers
garnished
with
claws
which
a
vulture
might
have
envied
set
my
ten
commandments
in
the
face
o
the
first
loon
that
lays
a
finger
on
him
hame

quoth
the
farmer
aforesaid
wad
better
set
you
to
be
nursing
the
gudeman
bairns
than
to
be
deaving
us
here
bairns
retorted
the
amazon
regarding
her
husband
with
a
grin
of
ineffable
contempt
bairns
o
gin
ye
were
dead
gudeman
and
a
green
turf
on
your
head
gudeman
then
i
wad
ware
my
widowhood
upon
a
ranting
this
canticle
which
excited
a
suppressed
titter
among
the
younger
part
of
the
audience
totally
overcame
the
patience
of
the
taunted
man
of
the
anvil
be
in
me
but
i
put
this
het
gad
down
her
throat
cried
he
in
an
ecstasy
of
wrath
snatching
a
bar
from
the
forge
and
he
might
have
executed
his
threat
had
he
not
been
withheld
by
a
part
of
the
mob
while
the
rest
endeavoured
to
force
the
termagant
out
of
his
presence
waverley
meditated
a
retreat
in
the
confusion
but
his
horse
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
at
length
he
observed
at
some
distance
his
faithful
attendant
ebenezer
who
as
soon
as
he
had
perceived
the
turn
matters
were
likely
to
take
had
withdrawn
both
horses
from
the
press
and
mounted
on
the
one
and
holding
the
other
answered
the
loud
and
repeated
calls
of
waverley
for
his
horse
na
if
ye
are
nae
friend
to
kirk
and
the
king
and
are
detained
as
siccan
a
person
ye
maun
answer
to
honest
men
of
the
country
for
breach
of
contract
and
i
maun
keep
the
naig
and
the
walise
for
damage
and
expense
in
respect
my
horse
and
mysell
will
lose
day
wark
besides
the
afternoon
preaching
edward
out
of
patience
hemmed
in
and
hustled
by
the
rabble
on
every
side
and
every
moment
expecting
personal
violence
resolved
to
try
measures
of
intimidation
and
at
length
drew
a
pistol
threatening
on
the
one
hand
to
shoot
whomsoever
dared
to
stop
him
and
on
the
other
menacing
ebenezer
with
a
similar
doom
if
he
stirred
a
foot
with
the
horses
the
sapient
partridge
says
that
one
man
with
a
pistol
is
equal
to
a
hundred
unarmed
because
though
he
can
shoot
but
one
of
the
multitude
yet
no
one
knows
but
that
he
himself
may
be
that
luckless
individual
the
levy
en
masse
of
cairnvreckan
would
therefore
probably
have
given
way
nor
would
ebenezer
whose
natural
paleness
had
waxed
three
shades
more
cadaverous
have
ventured
to
dispute
a
mandate
so
enforced
had
not
the
vulcan
of
the
village
eager
to
discharge
upon
some
more
worthy
object
the
fury
which
his
helpmate
had
provoked
and
not
ill
satisfied
to
find
such
an
object
in
waverley
rushed
at
him
with
the
bar
of
iron
with
such
determination
as
made
the
discharge
of
his
pistol
an
act
of
the
unfortunate
man
fell
and
while
edward
thrilled
with
a
natural
horror
at
the
incident
neither
had
presence
of
mind
to
unsheathe
his
sword
nor
to
draw
his
remaining
pistol
the
populace
threw
themselves
upon
him
disarmed
him
and
were
about
to
use
him
with
great
violence
when
the
appearance
of
a
venerable
clergyman
the
pastor
of
the
parish
put
a
curb
on
their
fury
this
worthy
man
none
of
the
goukthrapples
or
rentowels
maintained
his
character
with
the
common
people
although
he
preached
the
practical
fruits
of
christian
faith
as
well
as
its
abstract
tenets
and
was
respected
by
the
higher
orders
notwithstanding
he
declined
soothing
their
speculative
errors
by
converting
the
pulpit
of
the
gospel
into
a
school
of
heathen
morality
perhaps
it
is
owing
to
this
mixture
of
faith
and
practice
in
his
doctrine
that
although
his
memory
has
formed
a
sort
of
era
in
the
annals
of
cairnvreckan
so
that
the
parishioners
to
denote
what
befell
sixty
years
since
still
say
it
happened
good
morton
time
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
which
he
belonged
to
the
evangelical
or
the
moderate
party
in
the
kirk
nor
do
i
hold
the
circumstance
of
much
moment
since
in
my
own
remembrance
the
one
was
headed
by
an
erskine
the
other
by
a
robertson
footnote
the
reverend
john
erskine
d
an
eminent
scottish
divine
and
a
most
excellent
man
headed
the
evangelical
party
in
the
church
of
scotland
at
the
time
when
the
celebrated
doctor
robertson
the
historian
was
the
leader
of
the
moderate
party
these
two
distinguished
persons
were
colleagues
in
the
old
grey
friars
church
edinburgh
and
however
much
they
differed
in
church
politics
preserved
the
most
perfect
harmony
as
private
friends
and
as
clergymen
serving
the
same
cure
morton
had
been
alarmed
by
the
discharge
of
the
pistol
and
the
increasing
hubbub
around
the
smithy
his
first
attention
after
he
had
directed
the
bystanders
to
detain
waverley
but
to
abstain
from
injuring
him
was
turned
to
the
body
of
mucklewrath
over
which
his
wife
in
a
revulsion
of
feeling
was
weeping
howling
and
tearing
her
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
on
raising
up
the
smith
the
first
discovery
was
that
he
was
alive
and
the
next
that
he
was
likely
to
live
as
long
as
if
he
had
never
heard
the
report
of
a
pistol
in
his
life
he
had
made
a
narrow
escape
however
the
bullet
had
grazed
his
head
and
stunned
him
for
a
moment
or
two
which
trance
terror
and
confusion
of
spirit
had
prolonged
somewhat
longer
he
now
arose
to
demand
vengeance
on
the
person
of
waverley
and
with
difficulty
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
of
morton
that
he
should
be
carried
before
the
laird
as
a
justice
of
peace
and
placed
at
his
disposal
the
rest
of
the
assistants
unanimously
agreed
to
the
measure
recommended
even
mucklewrath
who
had
begun
to
recover
from
her
hysterics
whimpered
forth
wadna
say
naething
against
what
the
minister
proposed
he
was
ower
gude
for
his
trade
and
she
hoped
to
see
him
wi
a
dainty
decent
bishop
gown
on
his
back
a
comelier
sight
than
your
geneva
cloaks
and
bands
i
all
controversy
being
thus
laid
aside
waverley
escorted
by
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
village
who
were
not
was
conducted
to
the
house
of
cairnvreckan
which
was
about
half
a
mile
distant
chapter
xxxi
an
examination
major
melville
of
cairnvreckan
an
elderly
gentleman
who
had
spent
his
youth
in
the
military
service
received
morton
with
great
kindness
and
our
hero
with
civility
which
the
equivocal
circumstances
wherein
edward
was
placed
rendered
constrained
and
distant
the
nature
of
the
smith
hurt
was
inquired
into
and
as
the
actual
injury
was
likely
to
prove
trifling
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
received
rendered
the
infliction
on
edward
part
a
natural
act
of
the
major
conceived
he
might
dismiss
that
matter
on
waverley
depositing
in
his
hands
a
small
sum
for
the
benefit
of
the
wounded
person
could
wish
sir
continued
the
major
my
duty
terminated
here
but
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
have
some
further
inquiry
into
the
cause
of
your
journey
through
the
country
at
this
unfortunate
and
distracted
time
ebenezer
cruickshanks
now
stood
forth
and
communicated
to
the
magistrate
all
he
knew
or
suspected
from
the
reserve
of
waverley
and
the
evasions
of
callum
beg
the
horse
upon
which
edward
rode
he
said
he
knew
to
belong
to
vich
ian
vohr
though
he
dared
not
tax
edward
former
attendant
with
the
fact
lest
he
should
have
his
house
and
stables
burnt
over
his
head
some
night
by
that
godless
gang
the
he
concluded
by
exaggerating
his
own
services
to
kirk
and
state
as
having
been
the
means
under
god
as
he
modestly
qualified
the
assertion
of
attaching
this
suspicious
and
formidable
delinquent
he
intimated
hopes
of
future
reward
and
of
instant
reimbursement
for
loss
of
time
and
even
of
character
by
travelling
on
the
state
business
on
the
to
this
major
melville
answered
with
great
composure
that
so
far
from
claiming
any
merit
in
this
affair
cruickshanks
ought
to
deprecate
the
imposition
of
a
very
heavy
fine
for
neglecting
to
lodge
in
terms
of
the
recent
proclamation
an
account
with
the
nearest
magistrate
of
any
stranger
who
came
to
his
inn
that
as
cruickshanks
boasted
so
much
of
religion
and
loyalty
he
should
not
impute
this
conduct
to
disaffection
but
only
suppose
that
his
zeal
for
kirk
and
state
had
been
lulled
asleep
by
the
opportunity
of
charging
a
stranger
with
double
that
however
feeling
himself
incompetent
to
decide
singly
upon
the
conduct
of
a
person
of
such
importance
he
should
reserve
it
for
consideration
of
the
next
now
our
history
for
the
present
saith
no
more
of
him
of
the
candlestick
who
wended
dolorous
and
malcontent
back
to
his
own
dwelling
major
melville
then
commanded
the
villagers
to
return
to
their
homes
excepting
two
who
officiated
as
constables
and
whom
he
directed
to
wait
below
the
apartment
was
thus
cleared
of
every
person
but
morton
whom
the
major
invited
to
remain
a
sort
of
factor
who
acted
as
clerk
and
waverley
himself
there
ensued
a
painful
and
embarrassed
pause
till
major
melville
looking
upon
waverley
with
much
compassion
and
often
consulting
a
paper
or
memorandum
which
he
held
in
his
hand
requested
to
know
his
name
waverley
thought
so
late
of
the
dragoons
and
nephew
of
sir
everard
waverley
of
same
gentleman
i
am
extremely
sorry
that
this
painful
duty
has
fallen
to
my
lot
major
melville
renders
apologies
superfluous
sir
permit
me
therefore
to
ask
you
how
your
time
has
been
disposed
of
since
you
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
your
regiment
several
weeks
ago
until
the
present
moment
reply
said
waverley
so
general
a
question
must
be
guided
by
the
nature
of
the
charge
which
renders
it
necessary
i
request
to
know
what
that
charge
is
and
upon
what
authority
i
am
forcibly
detained
to
reply
to
it
charge
waverley
i
grieve
to
say
is
of
a
very
high
nature
and
affects
your
character
both
as
a
soldier
and
a
subject
in
the
former
capacity
you
are
charged
with
spreading
mutiny
and
rebellion
among
the
men
you
commanded
and
setting
them
the
example
of
desertion
by
prolonging
your
own
absence
from
the
regiment
contrary
to
the
express
orders
of
your
commanding
officer
the
civil
crime
of
which
you
stand
accused
is
that
of
high
treason
and
levying
war
against
the
king
the
highest
delinquency
of
which
a
subject
can
be
guilty
by
what
authority
am
i
detained
to
reply
to
such
heinous
calumnies
one
which
you
must
not
dispute
nor
i
disobey
he
handed
to
waverley
a
warrant
from
the
supreme
criminal
court
of
scotland
in
full
form
for
apprehending
and
securing
the
person
of
edward
waverley
suspected
of
treasonable
practices
and
other
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
the
astonishment
which
waverley
expressed
at
this
communication
was
imputed
by
major
melville
to
conscious
guilt
while
morton
was
rather
disposed
to
construe
it
into
the
surprise
of
innocence
unjustly
suspected
there
was
something
true
in
both
conjectures
for
although
edward
mind
acquitted
him
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
yet
a
hasty
review
of
his
own
conduct
convinced
him
he
might
have
great
difficulty
in
establishing
his
innocence
to
the
satisfaction
of
others
is
a
very
painful
part
of
this
painful
business
said
major
melville
after
a
pause
under
so
grave
a
charge
i
must
necessarily
request
to
see
such
papers
as
you
have
on
your
person
shall
sir
without
reserve
said
edward
throwing
his
and
memorandums
upon
the
table
is
but
one
with
which
i
could
wish
you
would
dispense
am
afraid
waverley
i
can
indulge
you
with
no
reservation
shall
see
it
then
sir
and
as
it
can
be
of
no
service
i
beg
it
may
be
returned
he
took
from
his
bosom
the
lines
he
had
that
morning
received
and
presented
them
with
the
envelope
the
major
perused
them
in
silence
and
directed
his
clerk
to
make
a
copy
of
them
he
then
wrapped
the
copy
in
the
envelope
and
placing
it
on
the
table
before
him
returned
the
original
to
waverley
with
an
air
of
melancholy
gravity
after
indulging
the
prisoner
for
such
our
hero
must
now
be
considered
with
what
he
thought
a
reasonable
time
for
reflection
major
melville
resumed
his
examination
premising
that
as
waverley
seemed
to
object
to
general
questions
his
interrogatories
should
be
as
specific
as
his
information
permitted
he
then
proceeded
in
his
investigation
dictating
as
he
went
on
the
import
of
the
questions
and
answers
to
the
amanuensis
by
whom
it
was
written
down
waverley
know
one
humphry
houghton
a
officer
in
gardiner
dragoons
he
was
sergeant
of
my
troop
and
son
of
a
tenant
of
my
uncle
and
had
a
considerable
share
of
your
confidence
and
an
influence
among
his
comrades
had
never
occasion
to
repose
confidence
in
a
person
of
his
description
answered
waverley
favoured
sergeant
houghton
as
a
clever
active
young
fellow
and
i
believe
his
respected
him
accordingly
you
used
through
this
man
answered
major
melville
communicate
with
such
of
your
troop
as
were
recruited
upon
the
poor
fellows
finding
themselves
in
a
regiment
chiefly
composed
of
scotch
or
irish
looked
up
to
me
in
any
of
their
little
distresses
and
naturally
made
their
countryman
and
sergeant
their
spokesman
on
such
occasions
houghton
influence
continued
the
major
then
particularly
over
those
soldiers
who
followed
you
to
the
regiment
from
your
uncle
estate
but
what
is
that
to
the
present
purpose
that
i
am
just
coming
and
i
beseech
your
candid
reply
have
you
since
leaving
the
regiment
held
any
correspondence
direct
or
indirect
with
this
sergeant
houghton
i
hold
correspondence
with
a
man
of
his
rank
and
situation
how
or
for
what
purpose
you
are
to
explain
but
did
you
not
for
example
send
to
him
for
some
books
remind
me
of
a
trifling
commission
said
waverley
i
gave
sergeant
houghton
because
my
servant
could
not
read
i
do
recollect
i
bade
him
by
letter
select
some
books
of
which
i
sent
him
a
list
and
send
them
to
me
at
of
what
description
were
those
books
related
almost
entirely
to
elegant
literature
they
were
designed
for
a
lady
perusal
there
not
waverley
treasonable
tracts
and
pamphlets
among
them
were
some
political
treatises
into
which
i
hardly
looked
they
had
been
sent
to
me
by
the
officiousness
of
a
kind
friend
whose
heart
is
more
to
be
esteemed
than
his
prudence
or
political
sagacity
they
seemed
to
be
dull
compositions
friend
continued
the
persevering
inquirer
a
pembroke
a
nonjuring
clergyman
the
author
of
two
treasonable
works
of
which
the
manuscripts
were
found
among
your
baggage
of
which
i
give
you
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
replied
waverley
never
read
six
pages
am
not
your
judge
waverley
your
examination
will
be
transmitted
elsewhere
and
now
to
proceed
do
you
know
a
person
that
passes
by
the
name
of
wily
will
or
will
ruthven
never
heard
of
such
a
name
till
this
moment
you
never
through
such
a
person
or
any
other
person
communicate
with
sergeant
humphry
houghton
instigating
him
to
desert
with
as
many
of
his
comrades
as
he
could
seduce
to
join
him
and
unite
with
the
highlanders
and
other
rebels
now
in
arms
under
the
command
of
the
young
pretender
assure
you
i
am
not
only
entirely
guiltless
of
the
plot
you
have
laid
to
my
charge
but
i
detest
it
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
nor
would
i
be
guilty
of
such
treachery
to
gain
a
throne
either
for
myself
or
any
other
man
alive
when
i
consider
this
envelope
in
the
handwriting
of
one
of
those
misguided
gentlemen
who
are
now
in
arms
against
their
country
and
the
verses
which
it
enclosed
i
can
not
but
find
some
analogy
between
the
enterprise
i
have
mentioned
and
the
exploit
of
wogan
which
the
writer
seems
to
expect
you
should
imitate
waverley
was
struck
with
the
coincidence
but
denied
that
the
wishes
or
expectations
of
the
were
to
be
regarded
as
proofs
of
a
charge
otherwise
chimerical
if
i
am
rightly
informed
your
time
was
spent
during
your
absence
from
the
regiment
between
the
house
of
this
highland
chieftain
and
that
of
bradwardine
of
bradwardine
also
in
arms
for
this
unfortunate
cause
do
not
mean
to
disguise
it
but
i
do
deny
most
resolutely
being
privy
to
any
of
their
designs
against
the
government
do
not
however
i
presume
intend
to
deny
that
you
attended
your
host
glennaquoich
to
a
rendezvous
where
under
a
pretence
of
a
general
hunting
match
most
of
the
accomplices
of
his
treason
were
assembled
to
concert
measures
for
taking
arms
acknowledge
having
been
at
such
a
meeting
said
waverley
i
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
which
could
give
it
the
character
you
affix
to
it
thence
you
proceeded
continued
the
magistrate
glennaquoich
and
a
part
of
his
clan
to
join
the
army
of
the
young
pretender
and
returned
after
having
paid
your
homage
to
him
to
discipline
and
arm
the
remainder
and
unite
them
to
his
bands
on
their
way
southward
never
went
with
glennaquoich
on
such
an
errand
i
never
so
much
as
heard
that
the
person
whom
you
mention
was
in
the
country
he
then
detailed
the
history
of
his
misfortune
at
the
hunting
match
and
added
that
on
his
return
he
found
himself
suddenly
deprived
of
his
commission
and
did
not
deny
that
he
then
for
the
first
time
observed
symptoms
which
indicated
a
disposition
in
the
highlanders
to
take
arms
but
added
that
having
no
inclination
to
join
their
cause
and
no
longer
any
reason
for
remaining
in
scotland
he
was
now
on
his
return
to
his
native
country
to
which
he
had
been
summoned
by
those
who
had
a
right
to
direct
his
motions
as
major
melville
would
perceive
from
the
letters
on
the
table
major
melville
accordingly
perused
the
letters
of
richard
waverley
of
sir
everard
and
of
aunt
rachel
but
the
inferences
he
drew
from
them
were
different
from
what
waverley
expected
they
held
the
language
of
discontent
with
government
threw
out
no
obscure
hints
of
revenge
and
that
of
poor
aunt
rachel
which
plainly
asserted
the
justice
of
the
stuart
cause
was
held
to
contain
the
open
avowal
of
what
the
others
only
ventured
to
insinuate
me
another
question
waverley
said
major
melville
you
not
receive
repeated
letters
from
your
commanding
officer
warning
you
and
commanding
you
to
return
to
your
post
and
acquainting
you
with
the
use
made
of
your
name
to
spread
discontent
among
your
soldiers
never
did
major
melville
one
letter
indeed
i
received
from
him
containing
a
civil
intimation
of
his
wish
that
i
would
employ
my
leave
of
absence
otherwise
than
in
constant
residence
at
bradwardine
as
to
which
i
own
i
thought
he
was
not
called
on
to
interfere
and
finally
i
received
on
the
same
day
on
which
i
observed
myself
superseded
in
the
gazette
a
second
letter
from
colonel
gardiner
commanding
me
to
join
the
regiment
an
order
which
owing
to
my
absence
already
mentioned
and
accounted
for
i
received
too
late
to
be
obeyed
if
there
were
any
intermediate
letters
and
certainly
from
the
colonel
high
character
i
think
it
probable
that
there
were
they
have
never
reached
me
have
omitted
waverley
continued
major
melville
inquire
after
a
matter
of
less
consequence
but
which
has
nevertheless
been
publicly
talked
of
to
your
disadvantage
it
is
said
that
a
treasonable
toast
having
been
proposed
in
your
hearing
and
presence
you
holding
his
majesty
commission
suffered
the
task
of
resenting
it
to
devolve
upon
another
gentleman
of
the
company
this
sir
can
not
be
charged
against
you
in
a
court
of
justice
but
if
as
i
am
informed
the
officers
of
your
regiment
requested
an
explanation
of
such
a
rumour
as
a
gentleman
and
soldier
i
can
not
but
be
surprised
that
you
did
not
afford
it
to
them
this
was
too
much
beset
and
pressed
on
every
hand
by
accusations
in
which
gross
falsehoods
were
blended
with
such
circumstances
of
truth
as
could
not
fail
to
procure
them
credit
alone
unfriended
and
in
a
strange
land
waverley
almost
gave
up
his
life
and
honour
for
lost
and
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
resolutely
refused
to
answer
any
further
questions
since
the
fair
and
candid
statement
he
had
already
made
had
only
served
to
furnish
arms
against
him
without
expressing
either
surprise
or
displeasure
at
the
change
in
waverley
manner
major
melville
proceeded
composedly
to
put
several
other
queries
to
him
does
it
avail
me
to
answer
you
said
edward
sullenly
appear
convinced
of
my
guilt
and
wrest
every
reply
i
have
made
to
support
your
own
preconceived
opinion
enjoy
your
supposed
triumph
then
and
torment
me
no
further
if
i
am
capable
of
the
cowardice
and
treachery
your
charge
burdens
me
with
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
believed
in
any
reply
i
can
make
to
you
if
i
am
not
deserving
of
your
suspicion
and
god
and
my
own
conscience
bear
evidence
with
me
that
it
is
so
then
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
by
my
candour
lend
my
accusers
arms
against
my
innocence
there
is
no
reason
i
should
answer
a
word
more
and
i
am
determined
to
abide
by
this
resolution
and
again
he
resumed
his
posture
of
sullen
and
determined
silence
me
said
the
magistrate
remind
you
of
one
reason
that
may
suggest
the
propriety
of
a
candid
and
open
confession
the
inexperience
of
youth
waverley
lays
it
open
to
the
plans
of
the
more
designing
and
artful
and
one
of
your
friends
at
least
i
mean
of
glennaquoich
ranks
high
in
the
latter
class
as
from
your
apparent
ingenuousness
youth
and
unacquaintance
with
the
manners
of
the
highlands
i
should
be
disposed
to
place
you
among
the
former
in
such
a
case
a
false
step
or
error
like
yours
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
consider
as
involuntary
may
be
atoned
for
and
i
would
willingly
act
as
intercessor
but
as
you
must
necessarily
be
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
individuals
in
this
country
who
have
assumed
arms
with
their
means
and
with
their
plans
i
must
expect
you
will
merit
this
mediation
on
my
part
by
a
frank
and
candid
avowal
of
all
that
has
come
to
your
knowledge
upon
these
heads
in
which
case
i
think
i
can
venture
to
promise
that
a
very
short
personal
restraint
will
be
the
only
ill
consequence
that
can
arise
from
your
accession
to
these
unhappy
intrigues
waverley
listened
with
great
composure
until
the
end
of
this
exhortation
when
springing
from
his
seat
with
an
energy
he
had
not
yet
displayed
he
replied
melville
since
that
is
your
name
i
have
hitherto
answered
your
questions
with
candour
or
declined
them
with
temper
because
their
import
concerned
myself
alone
but
as
you
presume
to
esteem
me
mean
enough
to
commence
informer
against
others
who
received
me
whatever
may
be
their
public
misconduct
as
a
guest
and
friend
i
declare
to
you
that
i
consider
your
questions
as
an
insult
infinitely
more
offensive
than
your
calumnious
suspicions
and
that
since
my
hard
fortune
permits
me
no
other
mode
of
resenting
them
than
by
verbal
defiance
you
should
sooner
have
my
heart
out
of
my
bosom
than
a
single
syllable
of
information
on
subjects
which
i
could
only
become
acquainted
with
in
the
full
confidence
of
unsuspecting
hospitality
morton
and
the
major
looked
at
each
other
and
the
former
who
in
the
course
of
the
examination
had
been
repeatedly
troubled
with
a
sorry
rheum
had
recourse
to
his
and
his
handkerchief
waverley
said
the
major
present
situation
prohibits
me
alike
from
giving
or
receiving
offence
and
i
will
not
protract
a
discussion
which
approaches
to
either
i
am
afraid
i
must
sign
a
warrant
for
detaining
you
in
custody
but
this
house
shall
for
the
present
be
your
prison
i
fear
i
can
not
persuade
you
to
accept
a
share
of
our
supper
edward
shook
his
head
but
i
will
order
refreshments
in
your
apartment
our
hero
bowed
and
withdrew
under
guard
of
the
officers
of
justice
to
a
small
but
handsome
room
where
declining
all
offers
of
food
or
wine
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
and
stupified
by
the
harassing
events
and
mental
fatigue
of
this
miserable
day
he
sunk
into
a
deep
and
heavy
slumber
this
was
more
than
he
himself
could
have
expected
but
it
is
mentioned
of
the
indians
when
at
the
stake
of
torture
that
on
the
least
intermission
of
agony
they
will
sleep
until
the
fire
is
applied
to
awaken
them
chapter
xxxii
a
conference
and
the
consequence
major
melville
had
detained
morton
during
his
examination
of
waverley
both
because
he
thought
he
might
derive
assistance
from
his
practical
good
sense
and
approved
loyalty
and
also
because
it
was
agreeable
to
have
a
witness
of
unimpeached
candour
and
veracity
to
proceedings
which
touched
the
honour
and
safety
of
a
young
englishman
of
high
rank
and
family
and
the
expectant
heir
of
a
large
fortune
every
step
he
knew
would
be
rigorously
canvassed
and
it
was
his
business
to
place
the
justice
and
integrity
of
his
own
conduct
beyond
the
limits
of
question
when
waverley
retired
the
laird
and
clergyman
of
cairnvreckan
sat
down
in
silence
to
their
evening
meal
while
the
servants
were
in
attendance
neither
chose
to
say
anything
on
the
circumstances
which
occupied
their
minds
and
neither
felt
it
easy
to
speak
upon
any
other
the
youth
and
apparent
frankness
of
waverley
stood
in
strong
contrast
to
the
shades
of
suspicion
which
darkened
around
him
and
he
had
a
sort
of
naivete
and
openness
of
demeanour
that
seemed
to
belong
to
one
unhackneyed
in
the
ways
of
intrigue
and
which
pleaded
highly
in
his
favour
each
mused
over
the
particulars
of
the
examination
and
each
viewed
it
through
the
medium
of
his
own
feelings
both
were
men
of
ready
and
acute
talent
and
both
were
equally
competent
to
combine
various
parts
of
evidence
and
to
deduce
from
them
the
necessary
conclusions
but
the
wide
difference
of
their
habits
and
education
often
occasioned
a
great
discrepancy
in
their
respective
deductions
from
admitted
premises
major
melville
had
been
versed
in
camps
and
cities
he
was
vigilant
by
profession
and
cautious
from
experience
had
met
with
much
evil
in
the
world
and
therefore
though
himself
an
upright
magistrate
and
an
honourable
man
his
opinions
of
others
were
always
strict
and
sometimes
unjustly
severe
morton
on
the
contrary
had
passed
from
the
literary
pursuits
of
a
college
where
he
was
beloved
by
his
companions
and
respected
by
his
teachers
to
the
ease
and
simplicity
of
his
present
charge
where
his
opportunities
of
witnessing
evil
were
few
and
never
dwelt
upon
but
in
order
to
encourage
repentance
and
amendment
and
where
the
love
and
respect
of
his
parishioners
repaid
his
affectionate
zeal
in
their
behalf
by
endeavouring
to
disguise
from
him
what
they
knew
would
give
him
the
most
acute
pain
namely
their
own
occasional
transgressions
of
the
duties
which
it
was
the
business
of
his
life
to
recommend
thus
it
was
a
common
saying
in
the
neighbourhood
though
both
were
popular
characters
that
the
laird
knew
only
the
ill
in
the
parish
and
the
minister
only
the
good
a
love
of
letters
though
kept
in
subordination
to
his
clerical
studies
and
duties
also
distinguished
the
pastor
of
cairnvreckan
and
had
tinged
his
mind
in
earlier
days
with
a
slight
feeling
of
romance
which
no
after
incidents
of
real
life
had
entirely
dissipated
the
early
loss
of
an
amiable
young
woman
whom
he
had
married
for
love
and
who
was
quickly
followed
to
the
grave
by
an
only
child
had
also
served
even
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
to
soften
a
disposition
naturally
mild
and
contemplative
his
feelings
on
the
present
occasion
were
therefore
likely
to
differ
from
those
of
the
severe
disciplinarian
strict
magistrate
and
distrustful
man
of
the
world
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
the
silence
of
both
parties
continued
until
major
melville
filling
his
glass
and
pushing
the
bottle
to
morton
commenced
distressing
affair
this
morton
i
fear
this
youngster
has
brought
himself
within
the
compass
of
a
halter
forbid
answered
the
clergyman
and
amen
said
the
temporal
magistrate
i
think
even
your
merciful
logic
will
hardly
deny
the
conclusion
major
answered
the
clergyman
should
hope
it
might
be
averted
for
aught
we
have
heard
tonight
replied
melville
my
good
parson
you
are
one
of
those
who
would
communicate
to
every
criminal
the
benefit
of
clergy
i
would
mercy
and
are
the
grounds
of
the
doctrine
i
am
called
to
teach
religiously
speaking
but
mercy
to
a
criminal
may
be
gross
injustice
to
the
community
i
do
speak
of
this
young
fellow
in
particular
who
i
heartily
wish
may
be
able
to
clear
himself
for
i
like
both
his
modesty
and
his
spirit
but
i
fear
he
has
rushed
upon
his
fate
why
hundreds
of
misguided
gentlemen
are
now
in
arms
against
the
government
many
doubtless
upon
principles
which
education
and
early
prejudice
have
gilded
with
the
names
of
patriotism
and
heroism
justice
when
she
selects
her
victims
from
such
a
multitude
for
surely
all
will
not
be
destroyed
must
regard
the
moral
motive
he
whom
ambition
or
hope
of
personal
advantage
has
led
to
disturb
the
peace
of
a
government
let
him
fall
a
victim
to
the
laws
but
surely
youth
misled
by
the
wild
visions
of
chivalry
and
imaginary
loyalty
may
plead
for
pardon
visionary
chivalry
and
imaginary
loyalty
come
within
the
predicament
of
high
treason
replied
the
magistrate
know
no
court
in
christendom
my
dear
morton
where
they
can
sue
out
their
habeas
corpus
i
can
not
see
that
this
youth
guilt
is
at
all
established
to
my
satisfaction
said
the
clergyman
your
blinds
your
good
sense
replied
major
melville
now
this
young
man
descended
of
a
family
of
hereditary
jacobites
his
uncle
the
leader
of
the
tory
interest
in
the
county
of
his
father
a
disobliged
and
discontented
courtier
his
tutor
a
nonjuror
and
the
author
of
two
treasonable
volumes
this
youth
i
say
enters
into
gardiner
dragoons
bringing
with
him
a
body
of
young
fellows
from
his
uncle
estate
who
have
not
stickled
at
avowing
in
their
way
the
principles
they
learned
at
in
their
disputes
with
their
comrades
to
these
young
men
waverley
is
unusually
attentive
they
are
supplied
with
money
beyond
a
soldier
wants
and
inconsistent
with
his
discipline
and
are
under
the
management
of
a
favourite
sergeant
through
whom
they
hold
an
unusually
close
communication
with
their
captain
and
affect
to
consider
themselves
as
independent
of
the
other
officers
and
superior
to
their
comrades
this
my
dear
major
is
the
natural
consequence
of
their
attachment
to
their
young
landlord
and
of
their
finding
themselves
in
a
regiment
levied
chiefly
in
the
north
of
ireland
and
the
west
of
scotland
and
of
course
among
comrades
disposed
to
quarrel
with
them
both
as
englishmen
and
as
members
of
the
church
of
england
said
parson
replied
the
magistrate
would
some
of
your
synod
heard
you
but
let
me
go
on
this
young
man
obtains
leave
of
absence
goes
to
the
principles
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
are
pretty
well
known
not
to
mention
that
this
uncle
brought
him
off
in
the
year
fifteen
he
engages
there
in
a
brawl
in
which
he
is
said
to
have
disgraced
the
commission
he
bore
colonel
gardiner
writes
to
him
first
mildly
then
more
sharply
i
think
you
will
not
doubt
his
having
done
so
since
he
says
so
the
mess
invite
him
to
explain
the
quarrel
in
which
he
is
said
to
have
been
involved
he
neither
replies
to
his
commander
nor
his
comrades
in
the
meanwhile
his
soldiers
become
mutinous
and
disorderly
and
at
length
when
the
rumour
of
this
unhappy
rebellion
becomes
general
his
favourite
sergeant
houghton
and
another
fellow
are
detected
in
correspondence
with
a
french
emissary
accredited
as
he
says
by
captain
waverley
who
urges
him
according
to
the
men
confession
to
desert
with
the
troop
and
join
their
captain
who
was
with
prince
charles
in
the
meanwhile
this
trusty
captain
is
by
his
own
admission
residing
at
glennaquoich
with
the
most
active
subtle
and
desperate
jacobite
in
scotland
he
goes
with
him
at
least
as
far
as
their
famous
hunting
rendezvous
and
i
fear
a
little
farther
meanwhile
two
other
summonses
are
sent
him
one
warning
him
of
the
disturbances
in
his
troop
another
peremptorily
ordering
him
to
repair
to
the
regiment
which
indeed
common
sense
might
have
dictated
when
he
observed
rebellion
thickening
all
round
him
he
returns
an
absolute
refusal
and
throws
up
his
commission
had
been
already
deprived
of
it
said
morton
he
regrets
replied
melville
the
measure
had
anticipated
his
resignation
his
baggage
is
seized
at
his
quarters
and
at
and
is
found
to
contain
a
stock
of
pestilent
jacobitical
pamphlets
enough
to
poison
a
whole
country
besides
the
unprinted
lucubrations
of
his
worthy
friend
and
tutor
mr
pembroke
says
he
never
read
them
answered
the
minister
an
ordinary
case
i
should
believe
him
replied
the
magistrate
they
are
as
stupid
and
pedantic
in
composition
as
mischievous
in
their
tenets
but
can
you
suppose
anything
but
value
for
the
principles
they
maintain
would
induce
a
young
man
of
his
age
to
lug
such
trash
about
with
him
then
when
news
arrive
of
the
approach
of
the
rebels
he
sets
out
in
a
sort
of
disguise
refusing
to
tell
his
name
and
if
yon
old
fanatic
tell
truth
attended
by
a
very
suspicious
character
and
mounted
on
a
horse
known
to
have
belonged
to
glennaquoich
and
bearing
on
his
person
letters
from
his
family
expressing
high
rancour
against
the
house
of
brunswick
and
a
copy
of
verses
in
praise
of
one
wogan
who
abjured
the
service
of
the
parliament
to
join
the
highland
insurgents
when
in
arms
to
restore
the
house
of
stuart
with
a
body
of
english
cavalry
the
very
counterpart
of
his
own
plot
and
summed
up
with
a
go
thou
and
do
likewise
from
that
loyal
subject
and
most
safe
and
peaceable
character
fergus
of
glennaquoich
vich
ian
vohr
and
so
forth
and
lastly
continued
major
melville
warming
in
the
detail
of
his
arguments
do
we
find
this
second
edition
of
cavalier
wogan
why
truly
in
the
very
track
most
proper
for
execution
of
his
design
and
pistolling
the
first
of
the
king
subjects
who
ventures
to
question
his
intentions
morton
prudently
abstained
from
argument
which
he
perceived
would
only
harden
the
magistrate
in
his
opinion
and
merely
asked
how
he
intended
to
dispose
of
the
prisoner
is
a
question
of
some
difficulty
considering
the
state
of
the
country
said
major
melville
you
not
detain
him
being
such
a
young
man
here
in
your
own
house
out
of
harm
way
till
this
storm
blow
over
good
friend
said
major
melville
your
house
nor
mine
will
be
long
out
of
harm
way
even
were
it
legal
to
confine
him
here
i
have
just
learned
that
the
who
marched
into
the
highlands
to
seek
out
and
disperse
the
insurgents
has
declined
giving
them
battle
at
coryarrick
and
marched
on
northward
with
all
the
disposable
force
of
government
to
inverness
house
or
the
devil
for
what
i
know
leaving
the
road
to
the
low
country
open
and
undefended
to
the
highland
army
god
said
the
clergyman
the
man
a
coward
a
traitor
or
an
idiot
of
the
three
i
believe
answered
melville
john
has
the
commonplace
courage
of
a
common
soldier
is
honest
enough
does
what
he
is
commanded
and
understands
what
is
told
him
but
is
as
fit
to
act
for
himself
in
circumstances
of
importance
as
i
my
dear
parson
to
occupy
your
pulpit
this
important
public
intelligence
naturally
diverted
the
discourse
from
waverley
for
some
time
at
length
however
the
subject
was
resumed
believe
said
major
melville
i
must
give
this
young
man
in
charge
to
some
of
the
detached
parties
of
armed
volunteers
who
were
lately
sent
out
to
overawe
the
disaffected
districts
they
are
now
recalled
towards
stirling
and
a
small
body
comes
this
way
or
next
day
commanded
by
the
westland
man
what
his
name
you
saw
him
and
said
he
was
the
very
model
of
one
of
cromwell
military
saints
the
cameronian
answered
morton
wish
the
young
gentleman
may
be
safe
with
him
strange
things
are
done
in
the
heat
and
hurry
of
minds
in
so
agitating
a
crisis
and
i
fear
gilfillan
is
of
a
sect
which
has
suffered
persecution
without
learning
mercy
has
only
to
lodge
waverley
in
stirling
castle
said
the
major
will
give
strict
injunctions
to
treat
him
well
i
really
can
not
devise
any
better
mode
for
securing
him
and
i
fancy
you
would
hardly
advise
me
to
encounter
the
responsibility
of
setting
him
at
liberty
you
will
have
no
objection
to
my
seeing
him
tomorrow
in
private
said
the
minister
certainly
your
loyalty
and
character
are
my
warrant
but
with
what
view
do
you
make
the
request
replied
morton
make
the
experiment
whether
he
may
not
be
brought
to
communicate
to
me
some
circumstances
which
may
hereafter
be
useful
to
alleviate
if
not
to
exculpate
his
conduct
the
friends
now
parted
and
retired
to
rest
each
filled
with
the
most
anxious
reflections
on
the
state
of
the
country
chapter
xxxiii
a
confidant
waverley
awoke
in
the
morning
from
troubled
dreams
and
unrefreshing
slumbers
to
a
full
consciousness
of
the
horrors
of
his
situation
how
it
might
terminate
he
knew
not
he
might
be
delivered
up
to
military
law
which
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
was
not
likely
to
be
scrupulous
in
the
choice
of
its
victims
or
the
quality
of
the
evidence
nor
did
he
feel
much
more
comfortable
at
the
thoughts
of
a
trial
before
a
scottish
court
of
justice
where
he
knew
the
laws
and
forms
differed
in
many
respects
from
those
of
england
and
had
been
taught
to
believe
however
erroneously
that
the
liberty
and
rights
of
the
subject
were
less
carefully
protected
a
sentiment
of
bitterness
rose
in
his
mind
against
the
government
which
he
considered
as
the
cause
of
his
embarrassment
and
peril
and
he
cursed
internally
his
scrupulous
rejection
of
invitation
to
accompany
him
to
the
field
did
not
i
he
said
to
himself
other
men
of
honour
take
the
earliest
opportunity
to
welcome
to
britain
the
descendant
of
her
ancient
kings
and
lineal
heir
of
her
throne
why
did
not
i
unthread
the
rude
eye
of
rebellion
and
welcome
home
again
discarded
faith
seek
out
prince
charles
and
fall
before
his
feet
all
that
has
been
recorded
of
excellence
and
worth
in
the
house
of
waverley
has
been
founded
upon
their
loyal
faith
to
the
house
of
stuart
from
the
interpretation
which
this
scotch
magistrate
has
put
upon
the
letters
of
my
uncle
and
father
it
is
plain
that
i
ought
to
have
understood
them
as
marshalling
me
to
the
course
of
my
ancestors
and
it
has
been
my
gross
dulness
joined
to
the
obscurity
of
expression
which
they
adopted
for
the
sake
of
security
that
has
confounded
my
judgment
had
i
yielded
to
the
first
generous
impulse
of
indignation
when
i
learned
that
my
honour
was
practised
upon
how
different
had
been
my
present
situation
i
had
then
been
free
and
in
arms
fighting
like
my
forefathers
for
love
for
loyalty
and
for
fame
and
now
i
am
here
netted
and
in
the
toils
at
the
disposal
of
a
suspicious
stern
and
man
perhaps
to
be
turned
over
to
the
solitude
of
a
dungeon
or
the
infamy
of
a
public
execution
o
fergus
how
true
has
your
prophecy
proved
and
how
speedy
how
very
speedy
has
been
its
accomplishment
while
edward
was
ruminating
on
these
painful
subjects
of
contemplation
and
very
naturally
though
not
quite
so
justly
bestowing
upon
the
reigning
dynasty
that
blame
which
was
due
to
chance
or
in
part
at
least
to
his
own
unreflecting
conduct
morton
availed
himself
of
major
melville
permission
to
pay
him
an
early
visit
waverley
first
impulse
was
to
intimate
a
desire
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
with
questions
or
conversation
but
he
suppressed
it
upon
observing
the
benevolent
and
reverend
appearance
of
the
clergyman
who
had
rescued
him
from
the
immediate
violence
of
the
villagers
believe
sir
said
the
unfortunate
young
man
in
any
other
circumstances
i
should
have
had
as
much
gratitude
to
express
to
you
as
the
safety
of
my
life
may
be
worth
but
such
is
the
present
tumult
of
my
mind
and
such
is
my
anticipation
of
what
i
am
yet
likely
to
endure
that
i
can
hardly
offer
you
thanks
for
your
interposition
morton
replied
that
far
from
making
any
claim
upon
his
good
opinion
his
only
wish
and
the
sole
purpose
of
his
visit
was
to
find
out
the
means
of
deserving
it
excellent
friend
major
melville
he
continued
feelings
and
duties
as
a
soldier
and
public
functionary
by
which
i
am
not
fettered
nor
can
i
always
coincide
in
opinions
which
he
forms
perhaps
with
too
little
allowance
for
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
he
paused
and
then
proceeded
do
not
intrude
myself
on
your
confidence
waverley
for
the
purpose
of
learning
any
circumstances
the
knowledge
of
which
can
be
prejudicial
either
to
yourself
or
to
others
but
i
own
my
earnest
wish
is
that
you
would
intrust
me
with
any
particulars
which
could
lead
to
your
exculpation
i
can
solemnly
assure
you
they
will
be
deposited
with
a
faithful
and
to
the
extent
of
his
limited
powers
a
zealous
agent
are
sir
i
presume
a
presbyterian
clergyman
morton
bowed
i
to
be
guided
by
the
prepossessions
of
education
i
might
distrust
your
friendly
professions
in
my
case
but
i
have
observed
that
similar
prejudices
are
nourished
in
this
country
against
your
professional
brethren
of
the
episcopal
persuasion
and
i
am
willing
to
believe
them
equally
unfounded
in
both
cases
to
him
that
thinks
otherwise
said
morton
who
holds
church
government
and
ceremonies
as
the
exclusive
gage
of
christian
faith
or
moral
virtue
continued
waverley
can
not
perceive
why
i
should
trouble
you
with
a
detail
of
particulars
out
of
which
after
revolving
them
as
carefully
as
possible
in
my
recollection
i
find
myself
unable
to
explain
much
of
what
is
charged
against
me
i
know
indeed
that
i
am
innocent
but
i
hardly
see
how
i
can
hope
to
prove
myself
so
is
for
that
very
reason
waverley
said
the
clergyman
i
venture
to
solicit
your
confidence
my
knowledge
of
individuals
in
this
country
is
pretty
general
and
can
upon
occasion
be
extended
your
situation
will
i
fear
preclude
your
taking
those
active
steps
for
recovering
intelligence
or
tracing
imposture
which
i
would
willingly
undertake
in
your
behalf
and
if
you
are
not
benefited
by
my
exertions
at
least
they
can
not
be
prejudicial
to
you
waverley
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
was
convinced
that
his
reposing
confidence
in
morton
so
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
could
hurt
neither
bradwardine
nor
fergus
both
of
whom
had
openly
assumed
arms
against
the
government
and
that
it
might
possibly
if
the
professions
of
his
new
friend
corresponded
in
sincerity
with
the
earnestness
of
his
expression
be
of
some
service
to
himself
he
therefore
ran
briefly
over
most
of
the
events
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
suppressing
his
attachment
to
flora
and
indeed
neither
mentioning
her
nor
rose
bradwardine
in
the
course
of
his
narrative
morton
seemed
particularly
struck
with
the
account
of
waverley
visit
to
donald
bean
lean
am
glad
he
said
did
not
mention
this
circumstance
to
the
major
it
is
capable
of
great
misconstruction
on
the
part
of
those
who
do
not
consider
the
power
of
curiosity
and
the
influence
of
romance
as
motives
of
youthful
conduct
when
i
was
a
young
man
like
you
waverley
any
such
expedition
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
expression
would
have
had
inexpressible
charms
for
me
but
there
are
men
in
the
world
who
will
not
believe
that
danger
and
fatigue
are
often
incurred
without
any
very
adequate
cause
and
therefore
who
are
sometimes
led
to
assign
motives
of
action
entirely
foreign
to
the
truth
this
man
bean
lean
is
renowned
through
the
country
as
a
sort
of
robin
hood
and
the
stories
which
are
told
of
his
address
and
enterprise
are
the
common
tales
of
the
winter
fireside
he
certainly
possesses
talents
beyond
the
rude
sphere
in
which
he
moves
and
being
neither
destitute
of
ambition
nor
encumbered
with
scruples
he
will
probably
attempt
by
every
means
to
distinguish
himself
during
the
period
of
these
unhappy
commotions
morton
then
made
a
careful
memorandum
of
the
various
particulars
of
waverley
interview
with
donald
bean
lean
and
the
other
circumstances
which
he
had
communicated
the
interest
which
this
good
man
seemed
to
take
in
his
misfortunes
above
all
the
full
confidence
he
appeared
to
repose
in
his
innocence
had
the
natural
effect
of
softening
heart
whom
the
coldness
of
major
melville
had
taught
to
believe
that
the
world
was
leagued
to
oppress
him
he
shook
morton
warmly
by
the
hand
and
assuring
him
that
his
kindness
and
sympathy
had
relieved
his
mind
of
a
heavy
load
told
him
that
whatever
might
be
his
own
fate
he
belonged
to
a
family
who
had
both
gratitude
and
the
power
of
displaying
it
the
earnestness
of
his
thanks
called
drops
to
the
eyes
of
the
worthy
clergyman
who
was
doubly
interested
in
the
cause
for
which
he
had
volunteered
his
services
by
observing
the
genuine
and
undissembled
feelings
of
his
young
friend
edward
now
inquired
if
morton
knew
what
was
likely
to
be
his
destination
castle
replied
his
friend
so
far
i
am
well
pleased
for
your
sake
for
the
governor
is
a
man
of
honour
and
humanity
but
i
am
more
doubtful
of
your
treatment
upon
the
road
major
melville
is
involuntarily
obliged
to
intrust
the
custody
of
your
person
to
another
am
glad
of
it
answered
waverley
detest
that
calculating
scotch
magistrate
i
hope
he
and
i
shall
never
meet
more
he
had
neither
sympathy
with
my
innocence
nor
with
my
wretchedness
and
the
petrifying
accuracy
with
which
he
attended
to
every
form
of
civility
while
he
tortured
me
by
his
questions
his
suspicions
and
his
inferences
was
as
tormenting
as
the
racks
of
the
inquisition
do
not
vindicate
him
my
dear
sir
for
that
i
can
not
bear
with
patience
tell
me
rather
who
is
to
have
the
charge
of
so
important
a
state
prisoner
as
i
am
believe
a
person
called
gilfillan
one
of
the
sect
who
are
termed
cameronians
never
heard
of
them
before
claim
said
the
clergyman
represent
the
more
strict
and
severe
presbyterians
who
in
charles
second
and
james
second
days
refused
to
profit
by
the
toleration
or
indulgence
as
it
was
called
which
was
extended
to
others
of
that
religion
they
held
conventicles
in
the
open
fields
and
being
treated
with
great

not
the

extinguish

replied
morton
great
event
fell
yet
far
short
of
what
they
proposed
which
was
nothing
less
than
the
complete
establishment
of
the
presbyterian
church
upon
the
grounds
of
the
old
solemn
league
and
covenant
indeed
i
believe
they
scarce
knew
what
they
wanted
but
being
a
numerous
body
of
men
and
not
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
arms
they
kept
themselves
together
as
a
separate
party
in
the
state
and
at
the
time
of
the
union
had
nearly
formed
a
most
unnatural
league
with
their
old
enemies
the
jacobites
to
oppose
that
important
national
measure
since
that
time
their
numbers
have
gradually
diminished
but
a
good
many
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
western
counties
and
several
with
a
better
temper
than
in
have
now
taken
arms
for
government
this
person
whom
they
call
gifted
gilfillan
has
been
long
a
leader
among
them
and
now
heads
a
small
party
which
will
pass
here
or
on
their
march
towards
stirling
under
whose
escort
major
melville
proposes
you
shall
travel
i
would
willingly
speak
to
gilfillan
in
your
behalf
but
having
deeply
imbibed
all
the
prejudices
of
his
sect
and
being
of
the
same
fierce
disposition
he
would
pay
little
regard
to
the
remonstrances
of
an
erastian
divine
as
he
would
politely
term
me
and
now
farewell
my
young
friend
for
the
present
i
must
not
weary
out
the
major
indulgence
that
i
may
obtain
his
permission
to
visit
you
again
in
the
course
of
the
day
chapter
xxxiv
things
mend
a
little
about
noon
morton
returned
and
brought
an
invitation
from
major
melville
that
waverley
would
honour
him
with
his
company
to
dinner
notwithstanding
the
unpleasant
affair
which
detained
him
at
cairnvreckan
from
which
he
should
heartily
rejoice
to
see
waverley
completely
extricated
the
truth
was
that
morton
favourable
report
and
opinion
had
somewhat
staggered
the
preconceptions
of
the
old
soldier
concerning
edward
supposed
accession
to
the
mutiny
in
the
regiment
and
in
the
unfortunate
state
of
the
country
the
mere
suspicion
of
disaffection
or
an
inclination
to
join
the
insurgent
jacobites
might
infer
criminality
indeed
but
certainly
not
dishonour
besides
a
person
whom
the
major
trusted
had
reported
to
him
though
as
it
proved
inaccurately
a
contradiction
of
the
agitating
news
of
the
preceding
evening
according
to
this
second
edition
of
the
intelligence
the
highlanders
had
withdrawn
from
the
lowland
frontier
with
the
purpose
of
following
the
army
in
their
march
to
inverness
the
major
was
at
a
loss
indeed
to
reconcile
his
information
with
the
abilities
of
some
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
highland
army
yet
it
was
the
course
which
was
likely
to
be
most
agreeable
to
others
he
remembered
the
same
policy
had
detained
them
in
the
north
in
the
year
and
he
anticipated
a
similar
termination
to
the
insurrection
as
upon
that
occasion
this
news
put
him
in
such
that
he
readily
acquiesced
in
morton
proposal
to
pay
some
hospitable
attention
to
his
unfortunate
guest
and
voluntarily
added
he
hoped
the
whole
affair
would
prove
a
youthful
escapade
which
might
be
easily
atoned
by
a
short
confinement
the
kind
mediator
had
some
trouble
to
prevail
on
his
young
friend
to
accept
the
invitation
he
dared
not
urge
to
him
the
real
motive
which
was
a
wish
to
secure
a
favourable
report
of
waverley
case
from
major
melville
to
governor
blakeney
he
remarked
from
the
flashes
of
our
spirit
that
touching
upon
this
topic
would
be
sure
to
defeat
his
purpose
he
therefore
pleaded
that
the
invitation
argued
the
major
disbelief
of
any
part
of
the
accusation
which
was
inconsistent
with
waverley
conduct
as
a
soldier
and
a
man
of
honour
and
that
to
decline
his
courtesy
might
be
interpreted
into
a
consciousness
that
it
was
unmerited
in
short
he
so
far
satisfied
edward
that
the
manly
and
proper
course
was
to
meet
the
major
on
easy
terms
that
suppressing
his
strong
dislike
again
to
encounter
his
cold
and
punctilious
civility
waverley
agreed
to
be
guided
by
his
new
friend
the
meeting
at
first
was
stiff
and
formal
enough
but
edward
having
accepted
the
invitation
and
his
mind
being
really
soothed
and
relieved
by
the
kindness
of
morton
held
himself
bound
to
behave
with
ease
though
he
could
not
affect
cordiality
the
major
was
somewhat
of
a
bon
vivant
and
his
wine
was
excellent
he
told
his
old
campaign
stories
and
displayed
much
knowledge
of
men
and
manners
morton
had
an
internal
fund
of
placid
and
quiet
gaiety
which
seldom
failed
to
enliven
any
small
party
in
which
he
found
himself
pleasantly
seated
waverley
whose
life
was
a
dream
gave
ready
way
to
the
predominating
impulse
and
became
the
most
lively
of
the
party
he
had
at
all
times
remarkable
natural
powers
of
conversation
though
easily
silenced
by
discouragement
on
the
present
occasion
he
piqued
himself
upon
leaving
on
the
minds
of
his
companions
a
favourable
impression
of
one
who
under
such
disastrous
circumstances
could
sustain
his
misfortunes
with
ease
and
gaiety
his
spirits
though
not
unyielding
were
abundantly
elastic
and
soon
seconded
his
efforts
the
trio
were
engaged
in
very
lively
discourse
apparently
delighted
with
each
other
and
the
kind
host
was
pressing
a
third
bottle
of
burgundy
when
the
sound
of
a
drum
was
heard
at
some
distance
the
major
who
in
the
glee
of
an
old
soldier
had
forgot
the
duties
of
a
magistrate
cursed
with
a
muttered
military
oath
the
circumstances
which
recalled
him
to
his
official
functions
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
window
which
commanded
a
very
near
view
of
the
highroad
and
he
was
followed
by
his
guests
the
drum
advanced
beating
no
measured
martial
tune
but
a
kind
of
like
that
with
which
the
startles
the
slumbering
artizans
of
a
scotch
burgh
it
is
the
object
of
this
history
to
do
justice
to
all
men
i
must
therefore
record
in
justice
to
the
drummer
that
he
protested
he
could
beat
any
known
march
or
point
of
war
known
in
the
british
army
and
had
accordingly
commenced
with
drums
when
he
was
silenced
by
gifted
gilfillan
the
commander
of
the
party
who
refused
to
permit
his
followers
to
move
to
this
profane
and
even
as
he
said
persecutive
tune
and
commanded
the
drummer
to
beat
the
psalm
as
this
was
beyond
the
capacity
of
the
drubber
of
sheepskin
he
was
fain
to
have
recourse
to
the
inoffensive
dow
as
a
harmless
substitute
for
the
sacred
music
which
his
instrument
or
skill
were
unable
to
achieve
this
may
be
held
a
trifling
anecdote
but
the
drummer
in
question
was
no
less
than
of
anderton
i
remember
his
successor
in
office
a
member
of
that
enlightened
body
the
british
convention
be
his
memory
therefore
treated
with
due
respect
chapter
xxxv
a
volunteer
sixty
years
since
on
hearing
the
unwelcome
sound
of
the
drum
major
melville
hastily
opened
a
sashed
door
and
stepped
out
upon
a
sort
of
terrace
which
divided
his
house
from
the
highroad
from
which
the
martial
music
proceeded
waverley
and
his
new
friend
followed
him
though
probably
he
would
have
dispensed
with
their
attendance
they
soon
recognised
in
solemn
march
first
the
performer
upon
the
drum
secondly
a
large
flag
of
four
compartments
on
which
were
inscribed
the
words
covenant
kirk
king
kingdoms
the
person
who
was
honoured
with
this
charge
was
followed
by
the
commander
of
the
party
a
thin
dark
man
about
sixty
years
old
the
spiritual
pride
which
in
mine
host
of
the
candlestick
mantled
in
a
sort
of
supercilious
hypocrisy
was
in
this
man
face
elevated
and
yet
darkened
by
genuine
and
undoubting
fanaticism
it
was
impossible
to
behold
him
without
imagination
placing
him
in
some
strange
crisis
where
religious
zeal
was
the
ruling
principle
a
martyr
at
the
stake
a
soldier
in
the
field
a
lonely
and
banished
wanderer
consoled
by
the
intensity
and
supposed
purity
of
his
faith
under
every
earthly
privation
perhaps
a
persecuting
inquisitor
as
terrific
in
power
as
unyielding
in
adversity
any
of
these
seemed
congenial
characters
to
this
personage
with
these
high
traits
of
energy
there
was
something
in
the
affected
precision
and
solemnity
of
his
deportment
and
discourse
that
bordered
upon
the
ludicrous
so
that
according
to
the
mood
of
the
spectator
mind
and
the
light
under
which
gilfillan
presented
himself
one
might
have
feared
admired
or
laughed
at
him
his
dress
was
that
of
a
peasant
of
better
materials
indeed
than
that
of
the
lower
rank
but
in
no
respect
affecting
either
the
mode
of
the
age
or
of
the
scottish
gentry
at
any
period
his
arms
were
a
broadsword
and
pistols
which
from
the
antiquity
of
their
appearance
might
have
seen
the
rout
of
pentland
or
bothwell
brigg
as
he
came
up
a
few
steps
to
meet
major
melville
and
touched
solemnly
but
slightly
his
huge
and
blue
bonnet
in
answer
to
the
major
who
had
courteously
raised
a
small
triangular
hat
waverley
was
irresistibly
impressed
with
the
idea
that
he
beheld
a
leader
of
the
roundheads
of
yore
in
conference
with
one
of
marlborough
captains
the
group
of
about
thirty
armed
men
who
followed
this
gifted
commander
was
of
a
motley
description
they
were
in
ordinary
lowland
dresses
of
different
colours
which
contrasted
with
the
arms
they
bore
gave
them
an
irregular
and
mobbish
appearance
so
much
is
the
eye
accustomed
to
connect
uniformity
of
dress
with
the
military
character
in
front
were
a
few
who
apparently
partook
of
their
leader
enthusiasm
men
obviously
to
be
feared
in
a
combat
where
their
natural
courage
was
exalted
by
religious
zeal
others
puffed
and
strutted
filled
with
the
importance
of
carrying
arms
and
all
the
novelty
of
their
situation
while
the
rest
apparently
fatigued
with
their
march
dragged
their
limbs
listlessly
along
or
straggled
from
their
companions
to
procure
such
refreshments
as
the
neighbouring
cottages
and
alehouses
afforded
six
grenadiers
of
ligonier
thought
the
major
to
himself
as
his
mind
reverted
to
his
own
military
experience
would
have
sent
all
these
fellows
to
the
right
about
greeting
however
gilfillan
civilly
he
requested
to
know
if
he
had
received
the
letter
he
had
sent
to
him
upon
his
march
and
could
undertake
the
charge
of
the
state
prisoner
whom
he
there
mentioned
as
far
as
stirling
castle
was
the
concise
reply
of
the
cameronian
leader
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
issue
from
the
very
penetralia
of
his
person
your
escort
gilfillan
is
not
so
strong
as
i
expected
said
major
melville
of
the
people
replied
gilfillan
and
were
athirst
by
the
way
and
tarried
until
their
poor
souls
were
refreshed
with
the
word
am
sorry
sir
replied
the
major
did
not
trust
to
your
refreshing
your
men
at
cairnvreckan
whatever
my
house
contains
is
at
the
command
of
persons
employed
in
the
service
was
not
of
i
spake
answered
the
covenanter
regarding
major
melville
with
something
like
a
smile
of
contempt
i
thank
you
but
the
people
remained
waiting
upon
the
precious
jabesh
rentowel
for
the
of
the
afternoon
exhortation
have
you
sir
said
the
major
the
rebels
are
about
to
spread
themselves
through
this
country
actually
left
a
great
part
of
your
command
at
a
fieldpreaching
gilfillan
again
smiled
scornfully
as
he
made
this
indirect
answer
thus
are
the
children
of
this
world
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
sir
said
the
major
you
are
to
take
charge
of
this
gentleman
to
stirling
and
deliver
him
with
these
papers
into
the
hands
of
governor
blakeney
i
beseech
you
to
observe
some
rules
of
military
discipline
upon
your
march
for
example
i
would
advise
you
to
keep
your
men
more
closely
together
and
that
each
in
his
march
should
cover
his
instead
of
straggling
like
geese
upon
a
common
and
for
fear
of
surprise
i
further
recommend
to
you
to
form
a
small
of
your
best
men
with
a
single
vidette
in
front
of
the
whole
march
so
that
when
you
approach
a
village
or
a
wood
here
the
major
interrupted
himself
as
i
do
observe
you
listen
to
me
gilfillan
i
suppose
i
need
not
give
myself
the
trouble
to
say
more
upon
the
subject
you
are
a
better
judge
unquestionably
than
i
am
of
the
measures
to
be
pursued
but
one
thing
i
would
have
you
well
aware
of
that
you
are
to
treat
this
gentleman
your
prisoner
with
no
rigour
nor
incivility
and
are
to
subject
him
to
no
other
restraint
than
is
necessary
for
his
security
have
looked
into
my
commission
said
gilfillan
subscribed
by
a
worthy
and
professing
nobleman
william
earl
of
glencairn
nor
do
i
find
it
therein
set
down
that
i
am
to
receive
any
charges
or
commands
anent
my
doings
from
major
william
melville
of
cairnvreckan
major
melville
reddened
even
to
the
ears
which
appeared
beneath
his
neat
military
sidecurls
the
more
so
as
he
observed
morton
smile
at
the
same
moment
gilfillan
he
answered
with
some
asperity
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
for
interfering
with
a
person
of
your
importance
i
thought
however
that
as
you
have
been
bred
a
grazier
if
i
mistake
not
there
might
be
occasion
to
remind
you
of
the
difference
between
highlanders
and
highland
cattle
and
if
you
should
happen
to
meet
with
any
gentleman
who
has
seen
service
and
is
disposed
to
speak
upon
the
subject
i
should
still
imagine
that
listening
to
him
would
do
you
no
sort
of
harm
but
i
have
done
and
have
only
once
more
to
recommend
this
gentleman
to
your
civility
as
well
as
to
your
custody
waverley
i
am
truly
sorry
we
should
part
in
this
way
but
i
trust
when
you
are
again
in
this
country
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
render
cairnvreckan
more
agreeable
than
circumstances
have
permitted
on
this
occasion
so
saying
he
shook
our
hero
by
the
hand
morton
also
took
an
affectionate
farewell
and
waverley
having
mounted
his
horse
with
a
musketeer
leading
it
by
the
bridle
and
a
file
upon
each
side
to
prevent
his
escape
set
forward
upon
the
march
with
gilfillan
and
his
party
through
the
little
village
they
were
accompanied
with
the
shouts
of
the
children
who
cried

to
have

entitled

the
rhymer
chapter
i
the
sun
was
nearly
set
behind
the
distant
mountains
of
liddesdale
when
a
few
of
the
scattered
and
terrified
inhabitants
of
the
village
of
hersildoune
which
had
four
days
before
been
burned
by
a
predatory
band
of
english
borderers
were
now
busied
in
repairing
their
ruined
dwellings
one
high
tower
in
the
centre
of
the
village
alone
exhibited
no
appearance
of
devastation
it
was
surrounded
with
court
walls
and
the
outer
gate
was
barred
and
bolted
the
bushes
and
brambles
which
grew
around
and
had
even
insinuated
their
branches
beneath
the
gate
plainly
showed
that
it
must
have
been
many
years
since
it
had
been
opened
while
the
cottages
around
lay
in
smoking
ruins
this
pile
deserted
and
desolate
as
it
seemed
to
be
had
suffered
nothing
from
the
violence
of
the
invaders
and
the
wretched
beings
who
were
endeavouring
to
repair
their
miserable
huts
against
nightfall
seemed
to
neglect
the
preferable
shelter
which
it
might
have
afforded
them
without
the
necessity
of
labour
before
the
day
had
quite
gone
down
a
knight
richly
armed
and
mounted
upon
an
ambling
hackney
rode
slowly
into
the
village
his
attendants
were
a
lady
apparently
young
and
beautiful
who
rode
by
his
side
upon
a
dappled
palfrey
his
squire
who
carried
his
helmet
and
lance
and
led
his
battlehorse
a
noble
steed
richly
caparisoned
a
page
and
four
yeomen
bearing
bows
and
quivers
short
swords
and
targets
of
a
span
breadth
completed
his
equipage
which
though
small
denoted
him
to
be
a
man
of
high
rank
he
stopped
and
addressed
several
of
the
inhabitants
whom
curiosity
had
withdrawn
from
their
labour
to
gaze
at
him
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
still
more
on
perceiving
the
george
cross
in
the
caps
of
his
followers
they
fled
with
a
loud
cry
the
southrons
were
returned
the
knight
endeavoured
to
expostulate
with
the
fugitives
who
were
chiefly
aged
men
women
and
children
but
their
dread
of
the
english
name
accelerated
their
flight
and
in
a
few
minutes
excepting
the
knight
and
his
attendants
the
place
was
deserted
by
all
he
paced
through
the
village
to
seek
a
shelter
for
the
night
and
despairing
to
find
one
either
in
the
inaccessible
tower
or
the
plundered
huts
of
the
peasantry
he
directed
his
course
to
the
left
hand
where
he
spied
a
small
decent
habitation
apparently
the
abode
of
a
man
considerably
above
the
common
rank
after
much
knocking
the
proprietor
at
length
showed
himself
at
the
window
and
speaking
in
the
english
dialect
with
great
signs
of
apprehension
demanded
their
business
the
warrior
replied
that
his
quality
was
an
english
knight
and
baron
and
that
he
was
travelling
to
the
court
of
the
king
of
scotland
on
affairs
of
consequence
to
both
kingdoms
my
hesitation
noble
sir
knight
said
the
old
man
as
he
unbolted
and
unbarred
his
doors
my
hesitation
but
we
are
here
exposed
to
too
many
intrusions
to
admit
of
our
exercising
unlimited
and
unsuspicious
hospitality
what
i
have
is
yours
and
god
send
your
mission
may
bring
back
peace
and
the
good
days
of
our
old
queen
margaret
worthy
franklin
quoth
the
knight
you
know
her
came
to
this
country
in
her
train
said
the
franklin
the
care
of
some
of
her
jointure
lands
which
she
devolved
on
me
occasioned
my
settling
here
how
do
you
being
an
englishman
said
the
knight
your
life
and
property
here
when
one
of
your
nation
can
not
obtain
a
single
night
lodging
or
a
draught
of
water
were
he
thirsty
noble
sir
answered
the
franklin
as
they
say
will
make
a
man
live
in
a
lion
den
and
as
i
settled
here
in
a
quiet
time
and
have
never
given
cause
of
offence
i
am
respected
by
my
neighbours
and
even
as
you
see
by
our
forayers
from
england
rejoice
to
hear
it
and
accept
your
hospitality
isabella
my
love
our
worthy
host
will
provide
you
a
bed
my
daughter
good
franklin
is
ill
at
ease
we
will
occupy
your
house
till
the
scottish
king
shall
return
from
his
northern
expedition
meanwhile
call
me
lord
lacy
of
chester
the
attendants
of
the
baron
assisted
by
the
franklin
were
now
busied
in
disposing
of
the
horses
and
arranging
the
table
for
some
refreshment
for
lord
lacy
and
his
fair
companion
while
they
sat
down
to
it
they
were
attended
by
their
host
and
his
daughter
whom
custom
did
not
permit
to
eat
in
their
presence
and
who
afterwards
withdrew
to
an
outer
chamber
where
the
squire
and
page
both
young
men
of
noble
birth
partook
of
supper
and
were
accommodated
with
beds
the
yeomen
after
doing
honour
to
the
rustic
cheer
of
queen
margaret
bailiff
withdrew
to
the
stable
and
each
beside
his
favourite
horse
snored
away
the
fatigues
of
their
journey
early
on
the
following
morning
the
travellers
were
roused
by
a
thundering
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
house
accompanied
with
many
demands
for
instant
admission
in
the
roughest
tone
the
squire
and
page
of
lord
lacy
after
buckling
on
their
arms
were
about
to
sally
out
to
chastise
these
intruders
when
the
old
host
after
looking
out
at
a
private
casement
contrived
for
reconnoitring
his
visitors
entreated
them
with
great
signs
of
terror
to
be
quiet
if
they
did
not
mean
that
all
in
the
house
should
be
murdered
he
then
hastened
to
the
apartment
of
lord
lacy
whom
he
met
dressed
in
a
long
furred
gown
and
the
knightly
cap
called
a
mortier
irritated
at
the
noise
and
demanding
to
know
the
cause
which
had
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
household
sir
said
the
franklin
of
the
most
formidable
and
bloody
of
the
scottish
border
riders
is
at
hand
he
is
never
seen
added
he
faltering
with
terror
far
from
the
hills
but
with
some
bad
purpose
and
the
power
of
accomplishing
it
so
hold
yourself
to
your
guard
for
a
loud
crash
here
announced
that
the
door
was
broken
down
and
the
knight
just
descended
the
stair
in
time
to
prevent
bloodshed
betwixt
his
attendants
and
the
intruders
they
were
three
in
number
their
chief
was
tall
bony
and
athletic
his
spare
and
muscular
frame
as
well
as
the
hardness
of
his
features
marked
the
course
of
his
life
to
have
been
fatiguing
and
perilous
the
effect
of
his
appearance
was
aggravated
by
his
dress
which
consisted
of
a
jack
or
jacket
composed
of
thick
buff
leather
on
which
small
plates
of
iron
of
a
lozenge
form
were
stitched
in
such
a
manner
as
to
overlap
each
other
and
form
a
coat
of
mail
which
swayed
with
every
motion
of
the
wearer
body
this
defensive
armour
covered
a
doublet
of
coarse
grey
cloth
and
the
borderer
had
a
few
plates
of
steel
on
his
shoulders
a
edged
sword
with
a
dagger
hanging
beside
it
in
a
buff
belt
a
helmet
with
a
few
iron
bars
to
cover
the
face
instead
of
a
visor
and
a
lance
of
tremendous
and
uncommon
length
completed
his
appointments
the
looks
of
the
man
were
as
wild
and
rude
as
his
attire
his
keen
black
eyes
never
rested
one
moment
fixed
upon
a
single
object
but
constantly
traversed
all
around
as
if
they
ever
sought
some
danger
to
oppose
some
plunder
to
seize
or
some
insult
to
revenge
the
latter
seemed
to
be
his
present
object
for
regardless
of
the
dignified
presence
of
lord
lacy
he
uttered
the
most
incoherent
threats
against
the
owner
of
the
house
and
his
guests
shall
see
ay
marry
shall
we
if
an
english
hound
is
to
harbour
and
reset
the
southrons
here
thank
the
abbot
of
melrose
and
the
good
knight
of
coldingnow
that
have
so
long
kept
me
from
your
skirts
but
those
days
are
gone
by
saint
mary
and
you
shall
find
it
it
is
probable
the
enraged
borderer
would
not
have
long
continued
to
vent
his
rage
in
empty
menaces
had
not
the
entrance
of
the
four
yeomen
with
their
bows
bent
convinced
him
that
the
force
was
not
at
this
moment
on
his
own
side
lord
lacy
now
advanced
towards
him
intrude
upon
my
privacy
soldier
withdraw
yourself
and
your
followers
there
is
peace
betwixt
our
nations
or
my
servants
should
chastise
thy
presumption
peace
as
ye
give
such
shall
ye
have
answered
the
trooper
first
pointing
with
his
lance
towards
the
burned
village
and
then
almost
instantly
levelling
it
against
lord
lacy
the
squire
drew
his
sword
and
severed
at
one
blow
the
steel
head
from
the
truncheon
of
the
spear
fitzherbert
said
the
baron
stroke
has
deferred
thy
knighthood
for
one
year
never
must
that
squire
wear
the
spurs
whose
unbridled
impetuosity
can
draw
unbidden
his
sword
in
the
presence
of
his
master
go
hence
and
think
on
what
i
have
said
the
squire
left
the
chamber
abashed
were
vain
continued
lord
lacy
expect
that
courtesy
from
a
mountain
churl
which
even
my
own
followers
can
forget
yet
before
thou
drawest
thy
brand
for
the
intruder
laid
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
thou
wilt
do
well
to
reflect
that
i
came
with
a
from
thy
king
and
have
no
time
to
waste
in
brawls
with
such
as

care
not
that
rotten
truncheon
striking
the
shattered
spear
furiously
on
the
ground
for
the
king

lothian
but
habby
of
cessford
will
be
here
belive
and
we
shall
soon
know
if
he
will
permit
an
english
churl
to
occupy
his
hostelrie
having
uttered
these
words
accompanied
with
a
lowering
glance
from
under
his
shaggy
black
eyebrows
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
house
with
his
two
followers
they
mounted
their
horses
which
they
had
tied
to
an
outer
fence
and
vanished
in
an
instant
is
this
discourteous
ruffian
said
lord
lacy
to
the
franklin
who
had
stood
in
the
most
violent
agitation
during
this
whole
scene
name
noble
lord
is
adam
kerr
of
the
moat
but
he
is
commonly
called
by
his
companions
the
black
rider
of
cheviot
i
fear
i
fear
he
comes
hither
for
no
good
but
if
the
lord
of
cessford
be
near
he
will
not
dare
offer
any
unprovoked
outrage
have
heard
of
that
chief
said
the
baron
me
know
when
he
approaches
and
do
thou
rodulph
to
the
eldest
yeoman
keep
a
strict
watch
adelbert
to
the
page
attend
to
arm
me
the
page
bowed
and
the
baron
withdrew
to
the
chamber
of
the
lady
isabella
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
no
more
of
the
proposed
tale
was
ever
written
but
the
purpose
was
that
it
should
turn
upon
a
fine
legend
of
superstition
which
is
current
in
the
part
of
the
borders
where
he
had
his
residence
where
in
the
reign
of
alexander
iii
of
scotland
that
renowned
person
thomas
of
hersildoune
called
the
rhymer
actually
flourished
this
personage
the
merlin
of
scotland
and
to
whom
some
of
the
adventures
which
the
british
bards
assigned
to
merlin
caledonius
or
the
wild
have
been
transferred
by
tradition
was
as
is
well
known
a
magician
as
well
as
a
poet
and
prophet
he
is
alleged
still
to
live
in
the
land
of
faery
and
is
expected
to
return
at
some
great
convulsion
of
society
in
which
he
is
to
act
a
distinguished
part
a
tradition
common
to
all
nations
as
the
belief
of
the
mahomedans
respecting
their
twelfth
imaum
demonstrates
now
it
chanced
many
years
since
that
there
lived
on
the
borders
a
jolly
rattling
who
was
remarkable
for
a
reckless
and
fearless
temper
which
made
him
much
admired
and
a
little
dreaded
amongst
his
neighbours
one
moonlight
night
as
he
rode
over
bowden
moor
on
the
west
side
of
the
eildon
hills
the
scene
of
thomas
the
rhymer
prophecies
and
often
mentioned
in
his
story
having
a
brace
of
horses
along
with
him
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
dispose
of
he
met
a
man
of
venerable
appearance
and
singularly
antique
dress
who
to
his
great
surprise
asked
the
price
of
his
horses
and
began
to
chaffer
with
him
on
the
subject
to
canobie
dick
for
so
shall
we
call
our
border
dealer
a
chap
was
a
chap
and
he
would
have
sold
a
horse
to
the
devil
himself
without
minding
his
cloven
hoof
and
would
have
probably
cheated
old
nick
into
the
bargain
the
stranger
paid
the
price
they
agreed
on
and
all
that
puzzled
dick
in
the
transaction
was
that
the
gold
which
he
received
was
in
unicorns
and
other
ancient
coins
which
would
have
been
invaluable
to
collectors
but
were
rather
troublesome
in
modern
currency
it
was
gold
however
and
therefore
dick
contrived
to
get
better
value
for
the
coin
than
he
perhaps
gave
to
his
customer
by
the
command
of
so
good
a
merchant
he
brought
horses
to
the
same
spot
more
than
once
the
purchaser
only
stipulating
that
he
should
always
come
by
night
and
alone
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
mere
curiosity
or
whether
some
hope
of
gain
mixed
with
it
but
after
dick
had
sold
several
horses
in
this
way
he
began
to
complain
that
dry
bargains
were
unlucky
and
to
hint
that
since
his
chap
must
live
in
the
neighbourhood
he
ought
in
the
courtesy
of
dealing
to
treat
him
to
half
a
mutchkin
may
see
my
dwelling
if
you
will
said
the
stranger
if
you
lose
courage
at
what
you
see
there
you
will
rue
it
all
your
life
dicken
however
laughed
the
warning
to
scorn
and
having
alighted
to
secure
his
horse
he
followed
the
stranger
up
a
narrow
which
led
them
up
the
hills
to
the
singular
eminence
stuck
betwixt
the
most
southern
and
the
centre
peaks
and
called
from
its
resemblance
to
such
an
animal
in
its
form
the
lucken
hare
at
the
foot
of
this
eminence
which
is
almost
as
famous
for
witch
meetings
as
the
neighbouring
of
kippilaw
dick
was
somewhat
startled
to
observe
that
his
conductor
entered
the
hillside
by
a
passage
or
cavern
of
which
he
himself
though
well
acquainted
with
the
spot
had
never
seen
or
heard
may
still
return
said
his
guide
looking
ominously
back
upon
him
but
dick
scorned
to
show
the
white
feather
and
on
they
went
they
entered
a
very
long
range
of
stables
in
every
stall
stood
a
horse
by
every
horse
lay
a
knight
in
black
armour
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
but
all
were
as
silent
hoof
and
limb
as
if
they
had
been
cut
out
of
marble
a
great
number
of
torches
lent
a
gloomy
lustre
to
the
hall
which
like
those
of
the
caliph
vathek
was
of
large
dimensions
at
the
upper
end
however
they
at
length
arrived
where
a
sword
and
horn
lay
on
an
antique
table
that
shall
sound
that
horn
and
draw
that
sword
said
the
stranger
who
now
intimated
that
he
was
the
famous
thomas
of
hersildoune
if
his
heart
fail
him
not
be
king
over
all
broad
britain
so
speaks
the
tongue
that
can
not
lie
but
all
depends
on
courage
and
much
on
your
taking
the
sword
or
the
horn
first
dick
was
much
disposed
to
take
the
sword
but
his
bold
spirit
was
quailed
by
the
supernatural
terrors
of
the
hall
and
he
thought
to
unsheath
the
sword
first
might
be
construed
into
defiance
and
give
offence
to
the
powers
of
the
mountain
he
took
the
bugle
with
a
trembling
hand
and
sounded
a
feeble
note
but
loud
enough
to
produce
a
terrible
answer
thunder
rolled
in
stunning
peals
through
the
immense
hall
horses
and
men
started
to
life
the
steeds
snorted
stamped
grinded
their
bits
and
tossed
on
high
their
heads
the
warriors
sprung
to
their
feet
clashed
their
armour
and
brandished
their
swords
dick
terror
was
extreme
at
seeing
the
whole
army
which
had
been
so
lately
silent
as
the
grave
in
uproar
and
about
to
rush
on
him
he
dropped
the
horn
and
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
seize
the
enchanted
sword
but
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
pronounced
aloud
the
mysterious
words
to
the
coward
that
ever
he
was
born
who
did
not
draw
the
sword
before
he
blew
the
horn
at
the
same
time
a
whirlwind
of
irresistible
fury
howled
through
the
long
hall
bore
the
unfortunate
clear
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
precipitated
him
over
a
steep
bank
of
loose
stones
where
the
shepherds
found
him
the
next
morning
with
just
breath
sufficient
to
tell
his
fearful
tale
after
concluding
which
he
expired
this
legend
with
several
variations
is
found
in
many
parts
of
scotland
and
england
the
scene
is
sometimes
laid
in
some
favourite
glen
of
the
highlands
sometimes
in
the
deep
of
northumberland
and
cumberland
which
run
so
far
beneath
the
ocean
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
reginald
scott
book
on
witchcraft
which
was
written
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
would
be
in
vain
to
ask
what
was
the
original
of
the
tradition
the
choice
between
the
horn
and
sword
may
perhaps
include
as
a
moral
that
it
is
foolhardy
to
awaken
danger
before

it

an

doctor
quoth
a

figure

somewhat
of

accent
why
should
you

necessity

treaty

answered
the
vicar
with
some
asperity
a
continental
war
entered
into
for
the
defence
of
an
ally
who
was
unwilling
to
defend
himself
and
for
the
restoration
of
a
royal
family
nobility
and
priesthood
who
tamely
abandoned
their
own
rights
is
a
burden
too
much
even
for
the
resources
of
this
country
was
the
war
then
on
the
part
of
great
britain
rejoined
the
abbe
gratuitous
exertion
of
generosity
was
there
no
fear
of
the
spirit
of
innovation
which
had
gone
abroad
did
not
the
laity
tremble
for
their
property
the
clergy
for
their
religion
and
every
loyal
heart
for
the
constitution
was
it
not
thought
necessary
to
destroy
the
building
which
was
on
fire
ere
the
conflagration
spread
around
the
vicinity
if
upon
trial
said
the
doctor
the
walls
were
found
to
resist
our
utmost
efforts
i
see
no
great
prudence
in
persevering
in
our
labour
amid
the
smouldering
ruins
doctor
said
the
baronet
i
call
to
your
recollection
your
own
sermon
on
the
late
general
fast
did
you
not
encourage
us
to
hope
that
the
lord
of
hosts
would
go
forth
with
our
armies
and
that
our
enemies
who
blasphemed
him
should
be
put
to
shame
may
please
a
kind
father
to
chasten
even
his
beloved
children
answered
the
vicar
think
said
a
gentleman
near
the
foot
of
the
table
the
covenanters
made
some
apology
of
the
same
kind
for
the
failure
of
their
prophecies
at
the
battle
of
dunbar
when
their
mutinous
preachers
compelled
the
prudent
lesley
to
go
down
against
the
philistines
in
gilgal
the
vicar
fixed
a
scrutinizing
and
not
a
very
complacent
eye
upon
this
intruder
he
was
a
young
man
of
mean
stature
and
rather
a
reserved
appearance
early
and
severe
study
had
quenched
in
his
features
the
gaiety
peculiar
to
his
age
and
impressed
upon
them
a
premature
cast
of
thoughtfulness
his
eye
had
however
retained
its
fire
and
his
gesture
its
animation
had
he
remained
silent
he
would
have
been
long
unnoticed
but
when
he
spoke
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
arrested
attention
is
this
young
man
said
the
vicar
in
a
low
voice
to
his
neighbour
scotchman
called
maxwell
on
a
visit
to
sir
henry
was
the
answer
thought
so
from
his
accent
and
his
manners
said
the
vicar
it
may
be
here
observed
that
the
northern
english
retain
rather
more
of
the
ancient
hereditary
aversion
to
their
neighbours
than
their
countrymen
of
the
south
the
interference
of
other
disputants
each
of
whom
urged
his
opinion
with
all
the
vehemence
of
wine
and
politics
rendered
the
summons
to
the
agreeable
to
the
more
sober
part
of
the
company
the
company
dispersed
by
degrees
and
at
length
the
vicar
and
the
young
scotchman
alone
remained
besides
the
baronet
his
lady
daughters
and
myself
the
clergyman
had
not
it
would
seem
forgot
the
observation
which
ranked
him
with
the
false
prophets
of
dunbar
for
he
addressed
maxwell
upon
the
first
opportunity
i
think
sir
you
mentioned
something
about
the
civil
wars
of
last
century
you
must
be
deeply
skilled
in
them
indeed
if
you
can
draw
any
parallel
betwixt
those
and
the
present
evil
days
days
which
i
am
ready
to
maintain
are
the
most
gloomy
that
ever
darkened
the
prospects
of
britain
forbid
doctor
that
i
should
draw
a
comparison
between
the
present
times
and
those
you
mention
i
am
too
sensible
of
the
advantages
we
enjoy
over
our
ancestors
faction
and
ambition
have
introduced
division
among
us
but
we
are
still
free
from
the
guilt
of
civil
bloodshed
and
from
all
the
evils
which
flow
from
it
our
foes
sir
are
not
those
of
our
own
household
and
while
we
continue
united
and
firm
from
the
attacks
of
a
foreign
enemy
however
artful
or
however
inveterate
we
have
i
hope
little
to
dread
you
found
anything
curious
maxwell
among
the
dusty
papers
said
sir
henry
who
seemed
to
dread
a
revival
of
political
discussion
investigation
amongst
them
led
to
reflections
at
which
i
have
just
now
hinted
said
maxwell
i
think
they
are
pretty
strongly
exemplified
by
a
story
which
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
arrange
from
some
of
your
family
manuscripts
are
welcome
to
make
what
use
of
them
you
please
said
sir
henry
they
have
been
undisturbed
for
many
a
day
and
i
have
often
wished
for
some
person
as
well
skilled
as
you
in
these
old
to
tell
me
their
meaning
i
just
mentioned
answered
maxwell
to
a
piece
of
private
history
savouring
not
a
little
of
the
marvellous
and
intimately
connected
with
your
family
if
it
is
agreeable
i
can
read
to
you
the
anecdotes
in
the
modern
shape
into
which
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
throw
them
and
you
can
then
judge
of
the
value
of
the
originals
there
was
something
in
this
proposal
agreeable
to
all
parties
sir
henry
had
family
pride
which
prepared
him
to
take
an
interest
in
whatever
related
to
his
ancestors
the
ladies
had
dipped
deeply
into
the
fashionable
reading
of
the
present
day
lady
ratcliff
and
her
fair
daughters
had
climbed
every
pass
viewed
every
shrouded
ruin
heard
every
groan
and
lifted
every
in
company
with
the
noted
heroine
of
udolpho
they
had
been
heard
however
to
observe
that
the
famous
incident
of
the
black
veil
singularly
resembled
the
ancient
apologue
of
the
mountain
in
labour
so
that
they
were
unquestionably
critics
as
well
as
admirers
besides
all
this
they
had
valorously
mounted
en
croupe
behind
the
ghostly
horseman
of
prague
through
all
his
seven
translators
and
followed
the
footsteps
of
moor
through
the
forest
of
bohemia
moreover
it
was
even
hinted
but
this
was
a
greater
mystery
than
all
the
rest
that
a
certain
performance
called
the
in
three
neat
volumes
had
been
seen
by
a
prying
eye
in
the
right
hand
drawer
of
the
indian
cabinet
of
lady
thus
predisposed
for
wonders
and
signs
lady
ratcliff
and
her
nymphs
drew
their
chairs
round
a
large
blazing
and
arranged
themselves
to
listen
to
the
tale
to
that
fire
i
also
approached
moved
thereunto
partly
by
the
inclemency
of
the
season
and
partly
that
my
deafness
which
you
know
cousin
i
acquired
during
my
campaign
under
prince
charles
edward
might
be
no
obstacle
to
the
gratification
of
my
curiosity
which
was
awakened
by
what
had
any
reference
to
the
fate
of
such
faithful
followers
of
royalty
as
you
well
know
the
house
of
ratcliff
have
ever
been
to
this
the
vicar

drew
near
and
reclined
himself
conveniently
in
his
chair
seemingly
disposed
to
testify
his
disrespect
for
the
narration

falling
asleep
as
soon
as
he
conveniently
could

the

said
maxwell
in

to
young
frank
ratcliff
my
dear
i
can
not
tell
you
the
exact
particulars
of
the
engagement
but
its
consequences
appear
from
the
following
letter
despatched
by
garbonete
von
eulen
daughter
of
our
journalist
to
a
relation
in
england
from
whom
she
implored
assistance
after
some
general
account
of
the
purpose
of
the
voyage
and
of
the
engagement

narrative

thus
noise
of
the
cannon
had
hardly
ceased
before
the
sounds
of
a
language
to
me
but
half
known
and
the
confusion
on
board
our
vessel
informed
me
that
the
captors
had
boarded
us
and
taken
possession
of
our
vessel
i
went
on
deck
where
the
first
spectacle
that
met
my
eyes
was
a
young
man
mate
of
our
vessel
who
though
disfigured
and
covered
with
blood
was
loaded
with
irons
and
whom
they
were
forcing
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
into
a
boat
the
two
principal
persons
among
our
enemies
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
a
tall
thin
figure
with
a
hat
and
long
neckband
and
head
of
hair

by

bluff

man

the

and
the

bearing
the
unlucky
young
man
soon
carried
him
on
board
the
frigate
perhaps
you
will
blame
me
for
mentioning
this
circumstance
but
consider
my
dear
cousin
this
man
saved
my
life
and
his
fate
even
when
my
own
and
my
father
were
in
the
balance
could
not
but
affect

lord

of

and
other
noble
guests
had
mounted
their
palfreys
and
the
hunt
set
forward
in
due
order
the
huntsmen
having
carefully
observed
the
traces
of
a
large
stag
on
the
preceding
evening
were
able
without
loss
of
time
to
conduct
the
company
by
the
marks
which
they
had
made
upon
the
trees
to
the
side
of
the
thicket
in
which
by
the
report
of
drawslot
he
had
harboured
all
night
the
horsemen
spreading
themselves
along
the
side
of
the
cover
waited
until
the
keeper
entered
leading
his
a
large
tied
in
a
learn
or
band
from
which
he
takes
his
name
but
it
befell
thus
a
hart
of
the
second
year
which
was
in
the
same
cover
with
the
proper
object
of
their
pursuit
chanced
to
be
unharboured
first
and
broke
cover
very
near
where
the
lady
emma
and
her
brother
were
stationed
an
inexperienced
varlet
who
was
nearer
to
them
instantly
unloosed
two
tall
greyhounds
who
sprung
after
the
fugitive
with
all
the
fleetness
of
the
north
wind
gregory
restored
a
little
to
spirits
by
the
enlivening
scene
around
him
followed
encouraging
the
hounds
with
a
loud
layout
for
which
he
had
the
hearty
curses
of
the
huntsman
as
well
as
of
the
baron
who
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
chase
with
all
the
juvenile
ardour
of
twenty
the
foul
fiend
booted
and
spurred
ride
down
his
bawling
throat
with
a
scythe
at
his
girdle
quoth
albert
drawslot
have
i
been
telling
him
that
all
the
marks
were
those
of
a
buck
of
the
first
head
and
he
has
hallooed
the
hounds
upon
a
knobbler
by
saint
hubert
if
i
break
not
his
pate
with
my
may
i
never
cast
off
hound
more
but
to
it
my
lords
and
masters
the
noble
beast
is
here
yet
and
thank
the
saints
we
have
enough
of
hounds
the
cover
being
now
thoroughly
beat
by
the
attendants
the
stag
was
compelled
to
abandon
it
and
trust
to
his
speed
for
his
safety
three
greyhounds
were
slipped
upon
him
whom
he
threw
out
after
running
a
couple
of
miles
by
entering
an
extensive
furzy
brake
which
extended
along
the
side
of
a
hill
the
horsemen
soon
came
up
and
casting
off
a
sufficient
number
of
sent
them
with
the
prickers
into
the
cover
in
order
to
drive
the
game
from
his
strength
this
object
being
accomplished
afforded
another
severe
chase
of
several
miles
in
a
direction
almost
circular
during
which
the
poor
animal
tried
every
wile
to
get
rid
of
his
persecutors
he
crossed
and
traversed
all
such
dusty
paths
as
were
likely
to
retain
the
least
scent
of
his
footsteps
he
laid
himself
close
to
the
ground
drawing
his
feet
under
his
belly
and
clapping
his
nose
close
to
the
earth
lest
he
should
be
betrayed
to
the
hounds
by
his
breath
and
hoofs
when
all
was
in
vain
and
he
found
the
hounds
coming
fast
in
upon
him
his
own
strength
failing
his
mouth
embossed
with
foam
and
the
tears
dropping
from
his
eyes
he
turned
in
despair
upon
his
pursuers
who
then
stood
at
gaze
making
an
hideous
clamour
and
awaiting
their
auxiliaries
of
these
it
chanced
that
the
lady
eleanor
taking
more
pleasure
in
the
sport
than
matilda
and
being
a
less
burden
to
her
palfrey
than
the
lord
boteler
was
the
first
who
arrived
at
the
spot
and
taking
a
from
an
attendant
discharged
a
bolt
at
the
stag
when
the
infuriated
animal
felt
himself
wounded
he
pushed
frantically
towards
her
from
whom
he
had
received
the
shaft
and
lady
eleanor
might
have
had
occasion
to
repent
of
her
enterprise
had
not
young
fitzallen
who
had
kept
near
her
during
the
whole
day
at
that
instant
galloped
briskly
in
and
ere
the
stag
could
change
his
object
of
assault
despatched
him
with
his
short
albert
drawslot
who
had
just
come
up
in
terror
for
the
young
lady
safety
broke
out
into
loud
encomiums
upon
strength
and
gallantry
lady
said
he
taking
off
his
cap
and
wiping
his
face
with
his
sleeve
struck
and
in
good
time
but
now
boys
doff
your
bonnets
and
sound
the
mort
the
sportsmen
then
sounded
a
treble
mort
and
set
up
a
general
whoop
which
mingled
with
the
yelping
of
the
dogs
made
the
welkin
ring
again
the
huntsman
then
offered
his
knife
to
lord
boteler
that
he
might
take
the
say
of
the
deer
but
the
baron
courteously
insisted
upon
fitzallen
going
through
that
ceremony
the
lady
matilda
was
now
come
up
with
most
of
the
attendants
and
the
interest
of
the
chase
being
ended
it
excited
some
surprise
that
neither
saint
clere
nor
his
sister
made
their
appearance
the
lord
boteler
commanded
the
horns
again
to
sound
the
recheat
in
hopes
to
call
in
the
stragglers
and
said
to
fitzallen
saint
clere
so
distinguished
for
service
in
war
should
have
been
more
forward
in
the
chase
trow
said
peter
lanaret
know
the
reason
of
the
noble
lord
absence
for
when
that
mooncalf
gregory
hallooed
the
dogs
upon
the
knobbler
and
galloped
like
a
green
hilding
as
he
is
after
them
i
saw
the
lady
emma
palfrey
follow
apace
after
that
varlet
who
should
be
thrashed
for
overrunning
and
i
think
her
noble
brother
has
followed
her
lest
she
should
come
to
harm
but
here
by
the
rood
is
gregory
to
answer
for
himself
at
this
moment
gregory
entered
the
circle
which
had
been
formed
round
the
deer
out
of
breath
and
his
face
covered
with
blood
he
kept
for
some
time
uttering
inarticulate
cries
of
and
and
other
exclamations
of
distress
and
terror
pointing
all
the
while
to
a
thicket
at
some
distance
from
the
spot
where
the
deer
had
been
killed
my
honour
said
the
baron
would
gladly
know
who
has
dared
to
array
the
poor
knave
thus
and
i
trust
he
should
dearly
abye
his
outrecuidance
were
he
the
best
save
one
in
england
gregory
who
had
now
found
more
breath
cried
an
ye
be
men
save
lady
emma
and
her
brother
whom
they
are
murdering
in
brokenhurst
thicket
this
put
all
in
motion
lord
boteler
hastily
commanded
a
small
party
of
his
men
to
abide
for
the
defence
of
the
ladies
while
he
himself
fitzallen
and
the
rest
made
what
speed
they
could
towards
the
thicket
guided
by
gregory
who
for
that
purpose
was
mounted
behind
fabian
pushing
through
a
narrow
path
the
first
object
they
encountered
was
a
man
of
small
stature
lying
on
the
ground
mastered
and
almost
strangled
by
two
dogs
which
were
instantly
recognised
to
be
those
that
had
accompanied
gregory
a
little
farther
was
an
open
space
where
lay
three
bodies
of
dead
or
wounded
men
beside
these
was
lady
emma
apparently
lifeless
her
brother
and
a
young
forester
bending
over
and
endeavouring
to
recover
her
by
employing
the
usual
remedies
this
was
soon
accomplished
while
lord
boteler
astonished
at
such
a
scene
anxiously
inquired
at
saint
clere
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
and
whether
more
danger
was
to
be
expected
the
present
i
trust
not
said
the
young
warrior
who
they
now
observed
was
slightly
wounded
i
pray
you
of
your
nobleness
let
the
woods
here
be
searched
for
we
were
assaulted
by
four
of
these
base
assassins
and
i
see
three
only
on
the
sward
the
attendants
now
brought
forwaid
the
person
whom
they
had
rescued
from
the
dogs
and
henry
with
disgust
shame
and
astonishment
recognised
his
kinsman
gaston
saint
clere
this
discovery
he
communicated
in
a
whisper
to
lord
boteler
who
commanded
the
prisoner
to
be
conveyed
to
and
closely
guarded
meanwhile
he
anxiously
inquired
of
young
saint
clere
about
his
wound
scratch
a
trifle
cried
henry
am
in
less
haste
to
bind
it
than
to
introduce
to
you
one
without
whose
aid
that
of
the
leech
would
have
come
too
late
where
is
he
where
is
my
brave
deliverer
most
noble
lord
said
gregory
sliding
from
his
palfrey
and
stepping
forward
to
receive
the
guerdon
which
your
bounty
would
heap
on
him
friend
gregory
answered
the
young
warrior
shalt
not
be
forgotten
for
thou
didst
run
speedily
and
roar
manfully
for
aid
without
which
i
think
verily
we
had
not
received
it
but
the
brave
forester
who
came
to
my
rescue
when
these
three
ruffians
had
nigh
overpowered
me
where
is
he
every
one
looked
around
but
though
all
had
seen
him
on
entering
the
thicket
he
was
not
now
to
be
found
they
could
only
conjecture
that
he
had
retired
during
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
detention
of
gaston
not
for
him
said
the
lady
emma
who
had
now
in
some
degree
recovered
her
composure
will
not
be
found
of
mortal
unless
at
his
own
season
the
baron
convinced
from
this
answer
that
her
terror
had
for
the
time
somewhat
disturbed
her
reason
forbore
to
question
her
and
matilda
and
eleanor
to
whom
a
message
had
been
despatched
with
the
result
of
this
strange
adventure
arriving
they
took
the
lady
emma
between
them
and
all
in
a
body
returned
to
the
castle
the
distance
was
however
considerable
and
before
reaching
it
they
had
another
alarm
the
prickers
who
rode
foremost
in
the
troop
halted
and
announced
to
the
lord
boteler
that
they
perceived
advancing
towards
them
a
body
of
armed
men
the
followers
of
the
baron
were
numerous
but
they
were
arrayed
for
the
chase
not
for
battle
and
it
was
with
great
pleasure
that
he
discerned
on
the
pennon
of
the
advancing
body
of
instead
of
the
cognisance
of
gaston
as
he
had
some
reason
to
expect
the
friendly
bearings
of
fitzosborne
of
diggswell
the
same
young
lord
who
was
present
at
the
with
fitzallen
of
harden
the
knight
himself
advanced
sheathed
in
armour
and
without
raising
his
visor
informed
lord
boteler
that
having
heard
of
a
base
attempt
made
upon
a
part
of
his
train
by
ruffianly
assassins
he
had
mounted
and
armed
a
small
party
of
his
retainers
to
escort
them
to
having
received
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
attend
them
thither
they
prosecuted
their
journey
in
confidence
and
security
and
arrived
safe
at
home
without
any
further
accident

clere
conclusion
so
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
princely
mansion
of
boteler
the
lady
emma
craved
permission
to
retire
to
her
chamber
that
she
might
compose
her
spirits
after
the
terror
she
had
undergone
henry
saint
clere
in
a
few
words
proceeded
to
explain
the
adventure
to
the
curious
audience
had
no
sooner
seen
my
sister
palfrey
in
spite
of
her
endeavours
to
the
contrary
entering
with
spirit
into
the
chase
set
on
foot
by
the
worshipful
gregory
than
i
rode
after
to
give
her
assistance
so
long
was
the
chase
that
when
the
greyhounds
pulled
down
the
knobbler
we
were
out
of
hearing
of
your
bugles
and
having
rewarded
and
coupled
the
dogs
i
gave
them
to
be
led
by
the
jester
and
we
wandered
in
quest
of
our
company
whom
it
would
seem
the
sport
had
led
in
a
different
direction
at
length
passing
through
the
thicket
where
you
found
us
i
was
surprised
by
a
bolt
whizzing
past
mine
head
i
drew
my
sword
and
rushed
into
the
thicket
but
was
instantly
assailed
by
two
ruffians
while
other
two
made
towards
my
sister
and
gregory
the
poor
knave
fled
crying
for
help
pursued
by
my
false
kinsman
now
your
prisoner
and
the
designs
of
the
other
on
my
poor
emma
murderous
no
doubt
were
prevented
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
brave
woodsman
who
after
a
short
encounter
stretched
the
miscreant
at
his
feet
and
came
to
my
assistance
i
was
already
slightly
wounded
and
nearly
overlaid
with
odds
the
combat
lasted
some
time
for
the
caitiffs
were
both
well
armed
strong
and
desperate
at
length
however
we
had
each
mastered
our
antagonist
when
your
retinue
my
lord
boteler
arrived
to
my
relief
so
ends
my
story
but
by
my
knighthood
i
would
give
an
earl
ransom
for
an
opportunity
of
thanking
the
gallant
forester
by
whose
aid
i
live
to
tell
it
not
said
lord
boteler
shall
be
found
if
this
or
the
four
adjacent
counties
hold
him
and
now
lord
fitzosborne
will
be
pleased
to
doff
the
armour
he
has
so
kindly
assumed
for
our
sakes
and
we
will
all
bowne
ourselves
for
the
banquet
when
the
hour
of
dinner
approached
the
lady
matilda
and
her
cousin
visited
the
chamber
of
the
fair
darcy
they
found
her
in
a
composed
but
melancholy
postmire
she
turned
the
discourse
upon
the
misfortunes
of
her
life
and
hinted
that
having
recovered
her
brother
and
seeing
him
look
forward
to
the
society
of
one
who
would
amply
repay
to
him
the
loss
of
hers
she
had
thoughts
of
dedicating
her
remaining
life
to
heaven
by
whose
providential
interference
it
had
been
so
often
preserved
matilda
coloured
deeply
at
something
in
this
speech
and
her
cousin
inveighed
loudly
against
emma
resolution
my
dear
lady
eleanor
replied
she
have
witnessed
what
i
can
not
but
judge
a
supernatural
visitation
and
to
what
end
can
it
call
me
but
to
give
myself
to
the
altar
that
peasant
who
guided
me
to
baddow
through
the
park
of
danbury
the
same
who
appeared
before
me
at
different
times
and
in
different
forms
during
that
eventful
journey
that
youth
whose
features
are
imprinted
on
my
memory
is
the
very
individual
forester
who
this
day
rescued
us
in
the
forest
i
can
not
be
mistaken
and
connecting
these
marvellous
appearances
with
the
spectre
which
i
saw
while
at
gay
bowers
i
can
not
resist
the
conviction
that
heaven
has
permitted
my
guardian
angel
to
assume
mortal
shape
for
my
relief
and
protection
the
fair
cousins
after
exchanging
looks
which
implied
a
fear
that
her
mind
was
wandering
answered
her
in
soothing
terms
and
finally
prevailed
upon
her
to
accompany
them
to
the
hall
here
the
first
person
they
encountered
was
the
baron
fitzosborne
of
diggswell
now
divested
of
his
armour
at
the
sight
of
whom
the
lady
emma
changed
colour
and
exclaiming
is
the
same
sunk
senseless
into
the
arms
of
matilda
is
bewildered
by
the
terrors
of
the
day
said
eleanor
and
we
have
done
ill
in
obliging
her
to
descend
i
fitzosborne
done
madly
in
presenting
before
her
one
whose
presence
must
recall
moments
the
most
alarming
in
her
life
while
the
ladies
supported
emma
from
the
hall
lord
boteler
and
saint
clere
requested
an
explanation
from
fitzosborne
of
the
words
he
had
used
me
gentle
lords
said
the
baron
of
diggswell
shall
have
what
ye
demand
when
i
learn
that
lady
emma
darcy
has
not
suffered
from
my
imprudence
at
this
moment
lady
matilda
returning
said
that
her
fair
friend
on
her
recovery
had
calmly
and
deliberately
insisted
that
she
had
seen
fitzosborne
before
in
the
most
dangerous
crisis
of
her
life
dread
said
she
disordered
mind
connects
all
that
her
eye
beholds
with
the
terrible
passages
that
she
has
witnessed
said
fitzosborne
noble
saint
clere
can
pardon
the
unauthorized
interest
which
with
the
purest
and
most
honourable
intentions
i
have
taken
in
his
sister
fate
it
is
easy
for
me
to
explain
this
mysterious
impression
he
proceeded
to
say
that
happening
to
be
in
the
hostelry
called
the
griffin
near
baddow
while
upon
a
journey
in
that
country
he
had
met
with
the
old
nurse
of
the
lady
emma
darcy
who
being
just
expelled
from
gay
bowers
was
in
the
height
of
her
grief
and
indignation
and
made
loud
and
public
proclamation
of
lady
wrongs
from
the
description
she
gave
of
the
beauty
of
her
child
as
well
as
from
the
spirit
of
chivalry
fitzosborne
became
interested
in
her
fate
this
interest
was
deeply
enhanced
when
by
a
bribe
to
old
gaunt
the
reve
he
procured
a
view
of
the
lady
emma
as
she
walked
near
the
castle
of
gay
bowers
the
aged
churl
refused
to
give
him
access
to
the
castle
yet
dropped
some
hints
as
if
he
thought
the
lady
in
danger
and
wished
she
were
well
out
of
it
his
master
he
said
had
heard
she
had
a
brother
in
life
and
since
that
deprived
him
of
all
chance
of
gaining
her
domains
by
purchase
he
in
short
gaunt
wished
they
were
safely
separated
any
injury
quoth
he
happen
to
the
damsel
here
it
were
ill
for
us
all
i
tried
by
an
innocent
stratagem
to
frighten
her
from
the
castle
by
introducing
a
figure
through
a
and
warning
her
as
if
by
a
voice
from
the
dead
to
retreat
from
thence
but
the
giglet
is
wilful
and
is
running
upon
her
fate
finding
gaunt
although
covetous
and
communicative
too
faithful
a
servant
to
his
wicked
master
to
take
any
active
steps
against
his
commands
fitzosborne
applied
himself
to
old
ursely
whom
he
found
more
tractable
through
her
he
learned
the
dreadful
plot
gaston
had
laid
to
rid
himself
of
his
kinswoman
and
resolved
to
effect
her
deliverance
but
aware
of
the
delicacy
of
emma
situation
he
charged
ursely
to
conceal
from
her
the
interest
he
took
in
her
distress
resolving
to
watch
over
her
in
disguise
until
he
saw
her
in
a
place
of
safety
hence
the
appearance
he
made
before
her
in
various
dresses
during
her
journey
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
never
far
distant
and
he
had
always
four
stout
yeomen
within
hearing
of
his
bugle
had
assistance
been
necessary
when
she
was
placed
in
safety
at
the
lodge
it
was
fitzosborne
intention
to
have
prevailed
upon
his
sisters
to
visit
and
take
her
under
their
protection
but
he
found
them
absent
from
diggswell
having
gone
to
attend
an
aged
relation
who
lay
dangerously
ill
in
a
distant
county
they
did
not
return
until
the
day
before
the
and
the
other
events
followed
too
rapidly
to
permit
fitzosborne
to
lay
any
plan
for
introducing
them
to
lady
emma
darcy
on
the
day
of
the
chase
he
resolved
to
preserve
his
romantic
disguise
and
attend
the
lady
emma
as
a
forester
partly
to
have
the
pleasure
of
being
near
her
and
partly
to
judge
whether
according
to
an
idle
report
in
the
country
she
favoured
his
friend
and
comrade
fitzallen
of
marden
this
last
motive
it
may
easily
be
believed
he
did
not
declare
to
the
company
after
the
skirmish
with
the
ruffians
he
waited
till
the
baron
and
the
hunters
arrived
and
then
still
doubting
the
farther
designs
of
gaston
hastened
to
his
castle
to
arm
the
band
which
had
escorted
them
to
hall
fitzosborne
story
being
finished
he
received
the
thanks
of
all
the
company
particularly
of
saint
clere
who
felt
deeply
the
respectful
delicacy
with
which
he
had
conducted
himself
towards
his
sister
the
lady
was
carefully
informed
of
her
obligations
to
him
and
it
is
left
to
the
reader
whether
even
the
raillery
of
lady
eleanor
made
her
regret
that
heaven
had
only
employed
natural
means
for
her
security
and
that
the
guardian
angel
was
converted
into
a
handsome
gallant
and
enamoured
knight
the
joy
of
the
company
in
the
hall
extended
itself
to
the
buttery
where
gregory
the
jester
narrated
such
feats
of
arms
done
by
himself
in
the
fray
of
the
morning
as
might
have
shamed
bevis
and
guy
of
warwick
he
was
according
to
his
narrative
singled
out
for
destruction
by
the
gigantic
baron
himself
while
he
abandoned
to
meaner
hands
the
destruction
of
saint
clere
and
fitzosborne
certes
said
he
foul
paynim
met
his
match
for
ever
as
he
foined
at
me
with
his
brand
i
parried
his
blows
with
my
bauble
and
closing
with
him
upon
the
third
veny
threw
him
to
the
ground
and
made
him
cry
recreant
to
an
unarmed
man
man
said
drawslot
forgettest
thy
best
auxiliaries
the
good
greyhounds
help
and
holdfast
i
warrant
thee
that
when
the
baron
caught
thee
by
the
cowl
which
he
hath
almost
torn
off
thou
hadst
been
in
a
fair
plight
had
they
not
remembered
an
old
friend
and
come
in
to
the
rescue
why
man
i
found
them
fastened
on
him
myself
and
there
was
odd
staving
and
stickling
to
make
them
ware
haunch
their
mouths
were
full
of
the
flex
for

pulled
a
piece
of
the
garment
from
their
jaws
i
warrant
thee
that
when
they
brought
him
to

thou
fledst
like
a
frighted

as
for

fabian
he
lies
yonder
in
the
the
very
size

and
colour
of
a

said
gregory
the

true
returned
fabian
that
the

is
to
be
married
on
tuesday
to

margery
gregory
thy

hath
brought
them

no
more
for
such
a

said
the
jester
than

do
for
thy
leasings

thou
happy
wouldst
thou
be
could
thy
head
reach
the
captive
baron
girdle
the
mass
said
peter
lanaret
will
have
one
peep
at
this
burly
gallant
and
leaving
the
buttery
he
went
to
the
room
where
gaston
saint
clere
was
confined
a
who
kept
sentinel
on
the
strong
studded
door
of
the
apartment
said
he
believed
he
slept
for
that
after
raging
stamping
and
uttering
the
most
horrid
imprecations
he
had
been
of
late
perfectly
still
the
falconer
gently
drew
back
a
sliding
board
of
a
foot
square
towards
the
top
of
the
door
which
covered
a
hole
of
the
same
size
strongly
latticed
through
which
the
warder
without
opening
the
door
could
look
in
upon
his
prisoner
from
this
aperture
he
beheld
the
wretched
gaston
suspended
by
the
neck
by
his
own
girdle
to
an
iron
ring
in
the
side
of
his
prison
he
had
clambered
to
it
by
means
of
the
table
on
which
his
food
had
been
placed
and
in
the
agonies
of
shame
and
disappointed
malice
had
adopted
this
mode
of
ridding
himself
of
a
wretched
life
he
was
found
yet
warm
but
totally
lifeless
a
proper
account
of
the
manner
of
his
death
was
drawn
up
and
certified
he
was
buried
that
evening
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
out
of
respect
to
his
high
birth
and
the
chaplain
of
fitzallen
of
marden
who
said
the
service
upon
the
occasion
preached
the
next
sunday
an
excellent
sermon
upon
the
text

we
have

the
manuscript
from
which
we
have
painfully
transcribed
and
frequently
as
it
were
translated
this
tale
for
the

is
so
indistinct
and
defaced
that
excepting
certain
howbeits

we
can
pick
out
little
that

saving
that

fragments
of

sermon
preached
by
gregory
upon
that
occasion
as
for

dear

there
was
once
a

he
wedded

footnote
this
tirade
of
gibberish
is
literally
taken
or
selected
from
a
mock
discourse
pronounced
by
a
professed
jester
which
occurs
in
an
ancient
manuscript
in
the
advocates
library
the
same
from
which
the
late
ingenious
weber
published
the
curious
comic
romance
of
the
hunting

was
introduced
in

enough
of

it
is
entertaining
to
find
commentators
seeking
to
discover
some
meaning
in
the
professional
jargon
of
such
a
passage
as
this
with
much
goodly
gibberish
to
the
same
effect
which
display
of
gregory
ready
wit
not
only
threw
the
whole
company
into
convulsions
of
laughter

made
such
an
impression
on

sturgeon
swan

profusion
of

we
also
see
that

was
produced
by
peretto
on
the
occasion

that
the
bishop
who
blessed
the
bridal
beds
which
received
the
happy
couples
was
no
niggard
of

holy
water
bestowing
half
a

upon

we
regret
we

not

to
expose

to
abler
antiquaries

soon

be

iii
anecdote
of
school
days
upon
which
thomas
scott
proposed
to
found
a
tale
of
fiction
it
is
well
known
in
the
south
that
there
is
little
or
no
boxing
at
the
scottish
schools
about
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
however
a
far
more
dangerous
mode
of
fighting
in
parties
or
factions
was
permitted
in
the
streets
of
edinburgh
to
the
great
disgrace
of
the
police
and
danger
of
the
parties
concerned
these
parties
were
generally
formed
from
the
quarters
of
the
town
in
which
the
combatants
resided
those
of
a
particular
square
or
district
fighting
against
those
of
an
adjoining
one
hence
it
happened
that
the
children
of
the
higher
classes
were
often
pitted
against
those
of
the
lower
each
taking
their
side
according
to
the
residence
of
their
friends
so
far
as
i
recollect
however
it
was
unmingled
either
with
feelings
of
democracy
or
aristocracy
or
indeed
with
malice
or
of
any
kind
towards
the
opposite
party
in
fact
it
was
only
a
rough
mode
of
play
such
contests
were
however
maintained
with
great
vigour
with
stones
and
sticks
and
fisticuffs
when
one
party
dared
to
charge
and
the
other
stood
their
ground
of
course
mischief
sometimes
happened
boys
are
said
to
have
been
killed
at
these
bickers
as
they
were
called
and
serious
accidents
certainly
took
place
as
many
contemporaries
can
bear
witness
the
author
father
residing
in
george
square
in
the
southern
side
of
edinburgh
the
boys
belonging
to
that
family
with
others
in
the
square
were
arranged
into
a
sort
of
company
to
which
a
lady
of
distinction
presented
a
handsome
set
of
colours
now
this
company
or
regiment
as
a
matter
of
course
was
engaged
in
weekly
warfare
with
the
boys
inhabiting
the
crosscauseway
bristo
street
the
potterrow
in
short
the
neighbouring
suburbs
these
last
were
chiefly
of
the
lower
rank
but
hardy
loons
who
threw
stones
to
a
and
were
very
rugged
antagonists
at
close
quarters
the
skirmish
sometimes
lasted
for
a
whole
evening
until
one
party
or
the
other
was
victorious
when
if
ours
were
successful
we
drove
the
enemy
to
their
quarters
and
were
usually
chased
back
by
the
reinforcement
of
bigger
lads
who
came
to
their
assistance
if
on
the
contrary
we
were
pursued
as
was
often
the
case
into
the
precincts
of
our
square
we
were
in
our
turn
supported
by
our
elder
brothers
domestic
servants
and
similar
auxiliaries
it
followed
from
our
frequent
opposition
to
each
other
that
though
not
knowing
the
names
of
our
enemies
we
were
yet
well
acquainted
with
their
appearance
and
had
nicknames
for
the
most
remarkable
of
them
one
very
active
and
spirited
boy
might
be
considered
as
the
principal
leader
in
the
cohort
of
the
suburbs
he
was
i
suppose
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
finely
made
tall
with
long
fair
hair
the
very
picture
of
a
youthful
goth
this
lad
was
always
first
in
the
charge
and
last
in
the
retreat
the
achilles
at
once
and
ajax
of
the
crosscauseway
he
was
too
formidable
to
us
not
to
have
a
cognomen
and
like
that
of
a
knight
of
old
it
was
taken
from
the
most
remarkable
part
of
his
dress
being
a
pair
of
old
green
livery
breeches
which
was
the
principal
part
of
his
clothing
for
like
pentapolin
according
to
don
quixote
account
as
we
called
him
always
entered
the
battle
with
bare
arms
legs
and
feet
it
fell
that
once
upon
a
time
when
the
combat
was
at
the
thickest
this
plebeian
champion
headed
a
sudden
charge
so
rapid
and
furious
that
all
fled
before
him
he
was
several
paces
before
his
comrades
and
had
actually
laid
his
hands
on
the
patrician
standard
when
one
of
our
party
whom
some
misjudging
friend
had
entrusted
with
a
couleau
de
chasse
or
hanger
inspired
with
a
zeal
for
the
honour
of
the
corps
worthy
of
major
sturgeon
himself
struck
poor
over
the
head
with
strength
sufficient
to
cut
him
down
when
this
was
seen
the
casualty
was
so
far
beyond
what
had
ever
taken
place
before
that
both
parties
fled
different
ways
leaving
poor
with
his
bright
hair
plentifully
dabbled
in
blood
to
the
care
of
the
watchman
who
honest
man
took
care
not
to
know
who
had
done
the
mischief
the
bloody
hanger
was
flung
into
one
of
the
meadow
ditches
and
solemn
secrecy
was
sworn
on
all
hands
but
the
remorse
and
terror
of
the
actor
were
beyond
all
bounds
and
his
apprehensions
of
the
most
dreadful
character
the
wounded
hero
was
for
a
few
days
in
the
infirmary
the
case
being
only
a
trifling
one
but
though
inquiry
was
strongly
pressed
on
him
no
argument
could
make
him
indicate
the
person
from
whom
he
had
received
the
wound
though
he
must
have
been
perfectly
well
known
to
him
when
he
recovered
and
was
dismissed
the
author
and
his
brothers
opened
a
communication
with
him
through
the
medium
of
a
popular
baker
of
whom
both
parties
were
customers
in
order
to
tender
a
subsidy
in
name
of
the
sum
would
excite
ridicule
were
i
to
name
it
but
sure
i
am
that
the
pockets
of
the
noted
never
held
as
much
money
of
his
own
he
declined
the
remittance
saying
that
he
would
not
sell
his
blood
but
at
the
same
time
reprobated
the
idea
of
being
an
informer
which
he
said
was
clam
base
or
mean
with
much
urgency
he
accepted
a
pound
of
snuff
for
the
use
of
some
old
woman
aunt
grandmother
or
the
like
with
whom
he
lived
we
did
not
become
friends
for
the
bickers
were
more
agreeable
to
both
parties
than
any
more
pacific
amusement
but
we
conducted
them
ever
after
under
mutual
assurances
of
the
highest
consideration
for
each
other
such
was
the
hero
whom
thomas
scott
proposed
to
carry
to
canada
and
involve
in
adventures
with
the
natives
and
colonists
of
that
country
perhaps
the
youthful
generosity
of
the
lad
will
not
seem
so
great
in
the
eyes
of
others
as
to
those
whom
it
was
the
means
of
screening
from
severe
rebuke
and
punishment
but
it
seemed
to
those
concerned
to
argue
a
nobleness
of
sentiment
far
beyond
the
pitch
of
most
minds
and
however
obscurely
the
lad
who
showed
such
a
frame
of
noble
spirit
may
have
lived
or
died
i
can
not
help
being
of
opinion
that
if
fortune
had
placed
him
in
circumstances
calling
for
gallantry
or
generosity
the
man
would
have
fulfilled
the
promise
of
the
boy
long
afterwards
when
the
story
was
told
to
my
father
he
censured
us
severely
for
not
telling
the
truth
at
the
time
that
he
might
have
attempted
to
be
of
use
to
the
young
man
in
entering
on
life
but
our
alarms
for
the
consequences
of
the
drawn
sword
and
the
wound
inflicted
with
such
a
weapon
were
far
too
predominant
at
the
time
for
such
a
pitch
of
generosity
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
inserted
this
schoolboy
tale
but
besides
the
strong
impression
made
by
the
incident
at
the
time
the
whole
accompaniments
of
the
story
are
matters
to
me
of
solemn
and
sad
recollection
of
all
the
little
band
who
were
concerned
in
those
juvenile
sports
or
brawls
i
can
scarce
recollect
a
single
survivor
some
left
the
ranks
of
mimic
war
to
die
in
the
active
service
of
their
country
many
sought
distant
lands
to
return
no
more
others
dispersed
in
different
paths
of
life
dim
eyes
now
seek
for
in
vain

five
brothers
all
healthy
and
promising
in
a
degree
far
beyond
one
whose
infancy
was
visited
by
personal
infirmity
and
whose
health
after
this
period
seemed
long
very
precarious
i
am
nevertheless
the
only
survivor
the
best
loved
and
the
best
deserving
to
be
loved

had
destined
this
incident
to
be

foundation

the
account
of
his
remarkable
conversion
as
related
by
doctor
doddridge
memorable
event
says
the
pious
writer
towards
the
middle
of
july
the
major
had
spent
the
evening
and
if
i
mistake
not
it
was
the
sabbath
in
some
gay
company
and
had
an
unhappy
assignation
with
a
married
woman
whom
he
was
to
attend
exactly
at
twelve
the
company
broke
up
about
eleven
and
not
judging
it
convenient
to
anticipate
the
time
appointed
he
went
into
his
chamber
to
kill
the
tedious
hour
perhaps
with
some
amusing
book
or
some
other
way
but
it
very
accidentally
happened
that
he
took
up
a
religious
book
which
his
good
mother
or
aunt
had
without
his
knowledge
slipped
into
his
portmanteau
it
was
called
if
i
remember
the
title
exactly
the
christian
soldier
or
heaven
taken
by
storm
and
it
was
written
by
thomas
watson
guessing
by
the
title
of
it
that
he
would
find
some
phrases
of
his
own
profession
spiritualised
in
a
manner
which
he
thought
might
afford
him
some
diversion
he
resolved
to
dip
into
it
but
he
took
no
serious
notice
of
anything
it
had
in
it
and
yet
while
this
book
was
in
his
hand
an
impression
was
made
upon
his
mind
perhaps
god
only
knows
how
which
drew
after
it
a
train
of
the
most
important
and
happy
consequences
he
thought
he
saw
an
unusual
blaze
of
light
fall
upon
the
book
which
he
was
reading
which
he
at
first
imagined
might
happen
by
some
accident
in
the
candle
but
lifting
up
his
eyes
he
apprehended
to
his
extreme
amazement
that
there
was
before
him
as
it
were
suspended
in
the
air
a
visible
representation
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
upon
the
cross
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
a
glory
and
was
impressed
as
if
a
voice
or
something
equivalent
to
a
voice
had
come
to
him
to
this
effect
for
he
was
not
confident
as
to
the
words
oh
sinner
did
i
suffer
this
for
thee
and
are
these
thy
returns
struck
with
so
amazing
a
phenomenon
as
this
there
remained
hardly
any
life
in
him
so
that
he
sunk
down
in
the
in
which
he
sat
and
continued
he
knew
not
how
long
insensible
regard
to
this
vision
says
the
ingenious
hibbert
appearance
of
our
saviour
on
the
cross
and
the
awful
words
repeated
can
be
considered
in
no
other
light
than
as
so
many
recollected
images
of
the
mind
which
probably
had
their
origin
in
the
language
of
some
urgent
appeal
to
repentance
that
the
colonel
might
have
casually
read
or
heard
delivered
from
what
cause
however
such
ideas
were
rendered
as
vivid
as
actual
impressions
we
have
no
information
to
be
depended
upon
this
vision
was
certainly
attended
with
one
of
the
most
important
of
consequences
connected
with
the
christian
dispensation
the
conversion
of
a
sinner
and
hence
no
single
narrative
has
perhaps
done
more
to
confirm
the
superstitious
opinion
that
apparitions
of
this
awful
kind
can
not
arise
without
a
divine
fiat
doctor
hibbert
adds
in
a
note
short
time
before
the
vision
colonel
gardiner
had
received
a
severe
fall
from
his
horse
did
the
brain
receive
some
slight
degree
of
injury
from
the
accident
so
as
to
predispose
him
to
this

illusion

the

ought
perhaps
to
be
ashamed
of
recording
that
he
has
had
the
honour
of
swallowing
the
contents
of
the

and
the
recollection
of
the
feat
served
to
suggest
the
story
of

the
family
of
scott
of
thirlestane
not
thirlestane
in

the

long
preserved

the
form
of

obliged
to
empty
this
at
his
departure
if
the

name
was
scott
the
necessity
was
doubly
imperative
when
the
landlord
of
an
inn
presented
his
guests
with
deoch
an
doruis
that
is
the
drink
at
the
door
or
the
the
draught
was
not
charged
in
the
reckoning
on
this
point
a
learned
bailie
of
the
town
of
forfar
pronounced
a
very
sound
judgment
an
in
forfar
had
brewed
her
of
malt
and
set
the
liquor
out
of
doors
to
cool
the
cow
of
a
neighbour
of
chanced
to
come
by
and
seeing
the
good
beverage
was
allured
to
taste
it
and
finally
to
drink
it
up
when
came
to
take
in
her
liquor
she
found
her
tub
empty
and
from
the
cow
staggering
and
staring
so
as
to
betray
her
intemperance
she
easily
divined
the
mode
in
which
her
had
disappeared
to
take
vengeance
on
crummie
ribs
with
a
stick
was
her
first
effort
the
roaring
of
the
cow
brought
her
master
who
remonstrated
with
his
angry
neighbour
and
received
in
reply
a
demand
for
the
value
of
the
ale
which
crummie
had
drunk
up
refused
payment
and
was
conveyed
before
the
bailie
or
sitting
magistrate
he
heard
the
case
patiently
and
then
demanded
of
the
plaintiff
whether
the
cow
had
sat
down
to
her
potation
or
taken
it
standing
the
plaintiff
answered
she
had
not
seen
the
deed
committed
but
she
supposed
the
cow
drank
the
ale
while
standing
on
her
feet
adding
that
had
she
been
near
she
would
have
made
her
use
them
to
some
purpose
the
bailie
on
this
admission
solemnly
adjudged
the
cow
drink
to
be
deoch
an
doruis
a
for
which
no
charge
could
be
made
without
violating
the
ancient
hospitality
of
scotland

said
to
have
happened
in

south
of

it
was

old

enough
to
resist
the
panic
which
seized
his

although

is
generally
reprobated
it
seems
nevertheless
to
have
been
adopted
in
the
arms
and
mottos
of
many
honourable

thus
the
motto
of

a

indeed
the
levying
of
was
before
practised
by
several
chiefs
of
very
high
rank
who
in
doing
so
contended
that
they
were
lending
the
laws
the
assistance
of
their
arms
and
swords
and
affording
a
protection
which
could
not
be
obtained
from
the
magistracy
in
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
the
author
has
seen
a
memoir
of
of
cluny
chief
of
that
ancient
clan
from
which
it
appears
that
he
levied
money
to
a
very
large
amount
which
was
willingly
paid
even
by
some
of
his
most
powerful
neighbours
a
gentleman
of
this
clan
hearing
a
clergyman
hold
forth
to
his
congregation
on
the
crime
of
theft
interrupted
the
preacher
to
assure
him
he
might
leave
the
enforcement
of
such
doctrines
to
cluny
whose
broadsword
would
put
a
stop
to
theft
sooner
than
all
the
sermons
of
all
the
ministers
of
the
synod
note
the
of
edinburgh
were
till
a
late
period
armed
with
this
weapon
when
on
their
there
was
a
hook
at
the
back
of
the
axe
which
the
ancient
highlanders
used
to
assist
them
to
climb
over
walls
fixing
the
hook
upon
it
and
raising
themselves
by
the
handle
the
axe
which
was
also
much
used
by
the
natives
of
ireland
is
supposed
to
have
been
introduced
into
both
countries
from
scandinavia
note
an
adventure
very
similar
to
what
is
here
stated
actually
befell
the
late
abercromby
of
tullibody
grandfather
of
the
present
lord
abercromby
and
father
of
the
celebrated
sir
ralph
when
this
gentleman
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
period
of
life
first
settled
in
stirlingshire
his
cattle
were
repeatedly
driven
off
by
the
celebrated
rob
roy
or
some
of
his
gang
and
at
length
he
was
obliged
after
obtaining
a
proper
to
make
the
cateran
such
a
visit
as
that
of
waverley
to
bean
lean
in
the
text
rob
received
him
with
much
courtesy
and
made
many
apologies
for
the
accident
which
must
have
happened
he
said
through
some
mistake
abercromby
was
regaled
with
collops
from
two
of
his
own
cattle
which
were
hung
up
by
the
heels
in
the
cavern
and
was
dismissed
in
perfect
safety
after
having
agreed
to
pay
in
future
a
small
sum
of
in
consideration
of
which
rob
roy
not
only
undertook
to
forbear
his
herds
in
future
but
to
replace
any
that
should
be
stolen
from
him
by
other
freebooters
abercromby
said
rob
roy
affected
to
consider
him
as
a
friend
to
the
jacobite
interest
and
a
sincere
enemy
to
the
union
neither
of
these
circumstances
were
true
but
the
laird
thought
it
quite
unnecessary
to
undeceive
his
highland
host
at
the
risk
of
bringing
on
a
political
dispute
in
such
a
situation
this
anecdote
i
received
many
years
since
about
from
the
mouth
of
the
venerable
gentleman
who
was
concerned
in
it
note
this
celebrated
gibbet
was
in
the
memory
of
the
last
generation
still
standing
at
the
western
end
of
the
town
of
crieff
in
perthshire
why
it
was
called
the
kind
gallows
we
are
unable
to
inform
the
reader
with
certainty
but
it
is
alleged
that
the
highlanders
used
to
touch
their
bonnets
as
they
passed
a
place
which
had
been
fatal
to
many
of
their
countrymen
with
the
ejaculation
bless
her
nain
sell
and
the
teil
tamn
you
it
may
therefore
have
been
called
kind
as
being
a
sort
of
native
or
kindred
place
of
doom
to
those
who
suffered
there
as
in
fulfilment
of
a
natural
destiny
note
the
story
of
the
bridegroom
carried
off
by
caterans
on
his
day
is
taken
from
one
which
was
told
to
the
author
by
the
late
laird
of
many
years
since
to
carry
off
persons
from
the
lowlands
and
to
put
them
to
ransom
was
a
common
practice
with
the
wild
highlanders
as
it
is
said
to
be
at
the
present
day
with
the
banditti
in
the
south
of
italy
upon
the
occasion
alluded
to
a
party
of
caterans
carried
off
the
bridegroom
and
secreted
him
in
some
cave
near
the
mountain
of
schiehallion
the
young
man
caught
the
before
his
ransom
could
be
agreed
on
and
whether
it
was
the
fine
cool
air
of
the
place
or
the
want
of
medical
attendance
did
not
pretend
to
be
positive
but
so
it
was
that
the
prisoner
recovered
his
ransom
was
paid
and
he
was
restored
to
his
friends
and
bride
but
always
considered
the
highland
robbers
as
having
saved
his
life
by
their
treatment
of
his
malady
note
this
happened
on
many
occasions
indeed
it
was
not
till
after
the
total
destruction
of
the
clan
influence
after
that
purchasers
could
be
found
who
offered
a
fair
price
for
the
estates
forfeited
in
which
were
then
brought
to
sale
by
the
creditors
of
the
york
buildings
company
who
had
purchased
the
whole
or
greater
part
from
government
at
a
very
small
price
even
so
late
as
the
period
first
mentioned
the
prejudices
of
the
public
in
favour
of
the
heirs
of
the
forfeited
families
threw
various
impediments
in
the
way
of
intending
purchasers
of
such
property
note
this
sort
of
political
game
ascribed
to
was
in
reality
played
by
several
highland
chiefs
the
celebrated
lord
lovat
in
particular
who
used
that
kind
of
finesse
to
the
uttermost
the
laird
of
mac
also
captain
of
an
independent
company
but
valued
the
sweets
of
present
pay
too
well
to
incur
the
risk
of
losing
them
in
the
jacobite
cause
his
martial
consort
raised
his
clan
and
headed
it
in
but
the
chief
himself
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
declaring
himself
for
that
monarch
and
no
other
who
gave
the
laird
of
mac
the
day
and
the
morn
note
in
explanation
of
the
military
exercise
observed
at
the
castle
of
glennaquoich
the
author
begs
to
remark
that
the
highlanders
were
not
only
well
practised
in
the
use
of
the
broadsword
firelock
and
most
of
the
manly
sports
and
trials
of
strength
common
throughout
scotland
but
also
used
a
peculiar
sort
of
drill
suited
to
their
own
dress
and
mode
of
warfare
there
were
for
instance
different
modes
of
disposing
the
plaid
one
when
on
a
peaceful
journey
another
when
danger
was
apprehended
one
way
of
enveloping
themselves
in
it
when
expecting
undisturbed
repose
and
another
which
enabled
them
to
start
up
with
sword
and
pistol
in
hand
on
the
slightest
alarm
previous
to
or
thereabouts
the
belted
plaid
was
universally
worn
in
which
the
portion
which
surrounded
the
middle
of
the
wearer
and
that
which
was
flung
around
his
shoulders
were
all
of
the
same
piece
of
tartan
in
a
desperate
onset
all
was
thrown
away
and
the
clan
charged
bare
beneath
the
doublet
save
for
an
artificial
arrangement
of
the
shirt
which
like
that
of
the
irish
was
always
ample
and
for
the
or
skin
purse
the
manner
of
handling
the
pistol
and
dirk
was
also
part
of
the
highland
manual
exercise
which
the
author
has
seen
gone
through
by
men
who
had
learned
it
in
their
youth
note
pork
or
swine
flesh
in
any
shape
was
till
of
late
years
much
abominated
by
the
scotch
nor
is
it
yet
a
favourite
food
amongst
them
king
jamie
carried
this
prejudice
to
england
and
is
known
to
have
abhorred
pork
almost
as
much
as
he
did
tobacco
ben
jonson
has
recorded
this
peculiarity
where
the
gipsy
in
a
masque
examining
the
king
hand
says
you
should
by
this
line
love
a
horse
and
a
hound

ranks
who
assembled
at

table
though
by
no
means
to
discuss

fare
the
highland
chiefs
only
retained
a
custom
which
had
been
formerly
universally
observed
throughout
scotland

sometimes
by

how
to

pretensions
to
be
a

the
full
honour
of

at
the

time
took
care
that
his
young
kinsmen
did
not
acquire
at
his
table
any
taste
for
outlandish
luxuries
his
lordship
was
always
ready
with
some
honourable
apology
why
foreign
wines
and
french

delicacies
which
he
conceived

characters

he
had
made
a
vow
that
he
would
never
take
a

without
returning
it
and
having
like
other
heroes
of
antiquity
descended
to

infernal
regions
