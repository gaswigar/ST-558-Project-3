calumet
k
had
been
let
to
macbride
company
of
minneapolis
in
january
but
the
superstructure
was
not
begun
until
late
in
may
and
at
the
end
of
october
it
was
still
far
from
completion
ill
luck
had
attended
peterson
the
constructor
especially
since
august
macbride
the
head
of
the
firm
disliked
unlucky
men
and
at
the
end
of
three
months
his
patience
gave
out
and
he
telegraphed
charlie
bannon
to
leave
the
job
he
was
completing
at
duluth
and
report
at
once
at
the
home
office
rumors
of
the
way
things
were
going
at
calumet
under
the
hands
of
his
younger
had
reached
bannon
and
he
was
not
greatly
surprised
when
macbride
told
him
to
go
to
chicago
sunday
night
and
supersede
peterson
at
ten
monday
morning
bannon
looking
out
through
the
dusty
window
of
the
trolley
car
caught
sight
of
the
elevator
the
naked
cribbing
of
its
huge
bins
looming
high
above
the
huddled
shanties
and
lumber
piles
about
it
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
walking
along
a
rickety
plank
sidewalk
which
seemed
to
lead
in
a
general
direction
toward
the
elevator
the
sidewalks
at
calumet
are
at
the
theoretical
grade
of
the
district
that
is
about
five
feet
above
the
actual
level
of
the
ground
in
winter
and
spring
they
are
necessary
causeways
above
seas
of
mud
but
in
dry
weather
every
one
abandons
them
to
walk
straight
to
his
destination
over
the
uninterrupted
flats
bannon
set
down
his
hand
bag
to
button
has
ulster
for
the
wind
was
driving
clouds
of
smoke
and
stinging
dust
and
an
occasional
grimy
snowflake
out
of
the
northwest
then
he
sprang
down
from
the
sidewalk
and
made
his
way
through
the
intervening
bogs
and
heedless
of
the
shouts
of
the
brakemen
over
a
freight
train
which
was
creaking
its
endless
length
across
his
path
to
the
elevator
site
the
elevator
lay
back
from
the
river
about
sixty
yards
and
parallel
to
it
between
was
the
main
line
of
the
four
clear
tracks
unbroken
by
switch
or
siding
on
the
wharf
along
with
a
big
pile
of
timber
was
the
beginning
of
a
small
spouting
house
to
be
connected
with
the
main
elevator
by
a
belt
gallery
above
the
tracks
a
hundred
yards
to
the
westward
up
the
river
the
belt
line
tracks
crossed
the
river
and
the
right
of
way
at
an
oblique
angle
and
sent
two
side
tracks
lengthwise
through
the
middle
of
the
elevator
and
a
third
along
the
south
side
that
is
the
side
away
from
the
river
bannon
glanced
over
the
lay
of
the
land
looked
more
particularly
at
the
long
ranges
of
timber
to
be
used
for
framing
the
cupola
and
then
asked
a
passing
workman
the
way
to
the
office
he
frowned
at
the
wretched
shanty
evidently
an
abandoned
belt
line
section
house
which
peterson
used
for
headquarters
then
setting
down
his
bag
just
outside
the
door
he
went
in
where
the
boss
he
asked
the
occupant
of
the
office
a
clerk
looked
up
impatiently
and
spoke
in
a
tone
reserved
to
discourage
seekers
for
work
he
ai
here
out
on
the
job
somewhere
palatial
office
you
got
bannon
commented
it
would
help
those
windows
to
ploughed
he
brought
his
bag
into
the
office
and
kicked
it
under
a
desk
then
began
turning
over
a
stack
of
blue
prints
that
lay
weighted
down
with
a
coupling
pin
on
the
table
i
guess
i
can
find
peterson
for
you
if
you
want
to
see
him
said
the
clerk
do
worry
about
my
finding
him
came
from
bannon
deep
in
his
study
of
the
plans
a
moment
later
he
went
out
a
gang
of
laborers
was
engaged
in
moving
the
timbers
back
from
the
railroad
siding
superintending
the
work
was
a
squat
little
man
bannon
could
not
see
until
near
by
that
he
was
not
a
boy
he
stood
there
in
his
his
back
to
bannon
swearing
at
the
men
when
he
turned
toward
him
bannon
saw
that
he
had
that
morning
played
an
unconscious
joke
upon
his
bright
red
hair
by
putting
on
a
crimson
necktie
bannon
asked
for
peterson
he
up
on
the
framing
of
the
spouting
house
over
on
the
wharf
there
what
are
you
carrying
that
stuff
around
for
asked
bannon
moving
it
back
to
make
room
by
the
siding
we
expecting
a
big
bill
of
cribbing
you
bannon
ai
you
bannon
nodded
peterson
had
a
telegram
from
the
office
saying
to
expect
you
you
still
expecting
that
cribbing
eh
harder
than
ever
that
most
all
we
been
doing
for
ten
days
there
peterson
now
up
there
with
the
sledge
bannon
looked
in
time
to
see
the
boss
spring
out
on
a
timber
that
was
still
balancing
and
swaying
upon
the
hoisting
rope
it
was
a
good
forty
feet
above
the
dock
clinging
to
the
rope
with
one
hand
with
the
other
peterson
drove
his
sledge
against
the
side
of
the
timber
which
swung
almost
to
its
exact
position
in
the
framing
slack
away
he
called
to
the
engineers
and
he
cast
off
the
rope
sling
then
cautiously
he
stepped
out
to
the
end
of
the
timber
it
tottered
but
the
lithe
figure
moved
on
to
within
striking
distance
he
swung
the
pound
sledge
in
a
circle
against
the
butt
of
the
timber
every
muscle
in
his
body
from
the
ankles
up
had
helped
to
deal
the
blow
and
the
big
stick
bucked
the
boss
sprang
erect
flinging
his
arms
wide
and
using
the
sledge
to
recover
his
balance
he
struck
hard
once
more
and
again
lightly
then
he
hammered
the
timber
down
on
the
iron
dowel
pins
all
right
he
shouted
to
the
engineer
send
up
the
next
one
a
few
minutes
later
bannon
climbed
out
on
the
framing
beside
him
hello
charlie
said
the
boss
i
been
looking
for
you
they
wired
me
you
was
coming
well
i
here
said
bannon
though
i
met
my
death
climbing
up
just
now
where
do
you
keep
your
ladders
what
do
i
want
of
a
ladder
i
no
use
for
a
man
who
ca
get
up
on
the
timbers
if
a
man
needs
a
ladder
he
better
stay
abed
that
where
i
get
fired
first
thing
said
bannon
why
you
come
up
all
right
with
your
overcoat
on
too
i
had
to
wear
it
or
scratch
up
the
timbers
with
my
bones
i
lost
pounds
up
at
duluth
another
big
timber
came
swinging
up
to
them
at
the
end
of
the
hoisting
rope
peterson
sprang
out
upon
it
i
going
down
before
i
get
brushed
off
said
bannon
i
be
back
at
the
office
as
soon
as
i
get
this
corbel
laid
no
hurry
i
want
to
look
over
the
drawings
go
easy
there
he
called
to
the
engineer
at
the
hoist
i
coming
down
on
the
elevator
peterson
had
already
cast
off
the
rope
but
bannon
jumped
for
it
and
thrust
his
foot
into
the
hook
and
the
engineer
not
knowing
who
he
was
let
him
down
none
too
gently
on
his
way
to
the
office
he
spoke
to
two
carpenters
at
work
on
a
stick
of
timber
you
better
leave
that
i
guess
and
get
some
cribbing
and
some
inch
stuff
and
make
some
ladders
i
guess
enough
lying
for
that
about
four
do
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
calumet
k
job
had
proved
too
much
for
peterson
it
was
difficult
from
the
beginning
there
was
not
enough
ground
space
to
work
in
comfortably
and
the
proper
bestowal
of
the
millions
of
feet
of
lumber
until
time
for
it
to
be
used
in
the
construction
was
no
mean
problem
the
elevator
was
to
be
a
typical
chicago
house
built
to
receive
grain
from
cars
and
to
deliver
it
either
to
cars
or
to
ships
as
has
been
said
it
stood
back
from
the
river
and
grain
for
ships
was
to
be
carried
on
belt
conveyors
running
in
an
inclosed
bridge
above
the
railroad
tracks
to
the
small
spouting
house
on
the
wharf
it
had
originally
been
designed
to
have
a
capacity
for
twelve
hundred
thousand
bushels
but
the
grain
men
who
were
building
it
page
company
had
decided
after
it
was
fairly
started
that
it
must
be
larger
so
in
the
midst
of
his
work
peterson
had
received
instructions
and
drawings
for
a
million
bushel
annex
he
had
done
excellent
work
work
satisfactory
even
to
macbride
company
on
a
smaller
scale
and
so
he
had
been
given
the
opportunity
the
responsibility
the
hundreds
of
employees
the
liberal
authority
to
make
what
he
could
of
it
all
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
had
made
a
tangle
that
the
big
job
as
a
whole
was
not
under
his
hand
but
was
just
running
itself
as
best
it
could
bannon
who
since
the
days
when
he
was
chief
of
the
wrecking
gang
on
a
division
of
the
grand
trunk
had
made
a
business
of
rising
to
emergencies
was
obviously
the
man
for
the
situation
he
was
worn
thin
as
an
old
he
was
just
at
the
end
of
a
piece
of
work
that
would
have
entitled
any
other
man
to
a
vacation
but
macbride
made
no
apologies
when
he
assigned
him
the
new
task
go
down
and
stop
this
fiddling
around
and
get
the
house
built
see
that
it
handling
grain
before
you
come
away
if
you
ca
do
it
i
come
down
and
do
it
myself
bannon
shook
his
head
dubiously
well
i
not
sure
he
began
but
macbride
laughed
whereupon
bannon
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
all
right
he
said
it
was
no
laughing
matter
though
here
on
the
job
this
monday
morning
and
once
alone
in
the
little
section
house
he
shook
his
head
again
gravely
he
liked
peterson
too
well
for
one
thing
to
supersede
him
without
a
qualm
but
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
and
he
took
off
his
overcoat
laid
aside
the
coupling
pin
and
attacked
the
stack
of
blue
prints
he
worked
rapidly
turning
now
and
then
from
the
plans
for
a
reference
to
the
building
book
or
the
specifications
whistling
softly
except
when
he
stopped
to
growl
from
force
of
habit
at
the
office
or
with
more
reasonable
disapproval
at
the
man
who
made
the
drawings
for
the
annex
regular
damn
bird
cage
he
called
it
it
was
half
an
hour
before
peterson
came
in
he
was
wiping
the
sweat
off
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
drawing
long
breaths
with
the
mere
enjoyment
of
living
i
feel
good
he
said
that
where
like
to
work
all
day
you
ought
to
go
up
and
sledge
them
timbers
for
a
while
that
warm
you
through
i
bet
you
ought
to
make
your
timekeeper
give
you
one
of
those
brass
checks
there
and
pay
you
eighteen
cents
an
hour
for
that
work
that
what
do
peterson
laughed
it
took
more
than
a
hint
to
reach
him
i
have
to
do
it
those
laborers
are
no
good
honest
i
can
lift
as
much
as
any
three
men
on
the
job
that
all
right
if
those
same
three
do
stop
to
swap
lies
while
you
lifting
well
i
guess
they
do
come
any
of
that
on
me
said
peterson
laughing
again
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
with
us
the
office
then
had
not
told
him
bannon
was
for
a
moment
at
a
loss
what
to
say
luckily
there
was
an
interruption
the
young
man
he
had
spoken
to
an
hour
before
came
in
tossed
a
tally
board
on
the
desk
and
said
that
another
carload
of
timber
had
come
in
bannon
said
peterson
shake
hands
with
max
vogel
our
lumber
checker
that
formality
attended
to
he
turned
to
bannon
and
repeated
his
question
by
that
time
the
other
had
his
answer
ready
oh
it
all
depends
on
the
office
he
said
they
bound
to
keep
me
busy
at
something
i
just
stay
until
they
tell
me
to
go
somewhere
else
they
ai
happy
except
when
they
just
put
me
in
a
hole
and
told
me
to
climb
out
generally
before
i
out
they
pick
me
up
and
chuck
me
down
another
one
old
macbride
would
think
the
company
was
prosperous
if
i
was
working
nights
and
sundays
you
wo
be
doing
that
down
here
i
do
know
about
that
why
when
i
first
went
to
work
for
they
hired
me
by
the
day
my
time
cards
for
the
first
years
figured
up
four
hundred
and
days
peterson
laughed
oh
that
straight
said
bannon
next
time
you
at
the
office
ask
brown
about
it
since
then
they
paid
me
a
salary
they
seem
to
think
they
have
to
go
out
of
business
if
i
ever
took
a
vacation
i
been
with
twelve
years
and
they
never
given
me
one
yet
they
made
a
bluff
at
it
once
i
was
down
at
newport
news
been
doing
a
job
for
the
and
fred
brown
was
down
that
way
on
business
he
what
does
brown
look
like
interrupted
peterson
i
never
saw
him
you
did
oh
he
a
young
chap
dresses
kind
of
sporty
he
a
great
jollier
you
have
to
know
him
a
while
to
find
out
that
he
means
business
well
he
came
and
saw
i
was
feeling
pretty
tired
so
he
asked
me
to
knock
off
for
a
week
and
go
fishing
with
him
i
did
and
it
was
the
hardest
work
i
ever
tackled
did
you
get
any
fish
fish
whales
you
no
sooner
throw
your
line
over
than
another
grab
it
great
big
heavy
fish
and
they
never
gave
us
a
minute
rest
i
worked
like
a
horse
for
about
half
a
day
and
then
i
gave
up
told
brown
i
take
a
duplex
along
next
time
i
tackled
that
kind
of
a
job
and
i
went
back
to
the
elevator
i
like
to
see
brown
i
get
letters
from
him
right
along
of
course
he
been
jollying
me
about
that
cribbing
for
the
last
two
weeks
i
ca
make
it
grow
and
i
written
him
right
along
that
we
was
expecting
it
but
that
do
seem
to
satisfy
him
i
suppose
not
said
bannon
they
mostly
out
for
results
up
at
the
office
let
see
the
bill
for
it
vogel
handed
him
a
thin
typewritten
sheet
and
bannon
looked
it
over
thoughtfully
big
lot
of
stuff
it
have
you
tried
to
get
any
of
it
here
in
chicago
course
not
it
all
ordered
and
cut
out
up
to
ledyard
cut
out
then
why
do
they
send
it

the
cars

sort
of
a
railroad

you
about

peterson
it
the
said
the
lumber
checker
that
enough
for
any
one
who
lived
in
michigan
it
ai
much
good
how
long
have
they
kept
waiting
for
the
cars
how
long
is
it
max
asked
peterson
let
see
it
was
two
weeks
ago
come
tuesday
sure
yes
we
got
the
letter
the
same
day
the
man
came
here
his
hair
was
good
and
red
max
laughed
broadly
at
the
recollection
he
came
into
the
office
just
as
we
was
reading
it
oh
yes
my
friend
the
walking
delegate
what
that
bannon
snapped
the
words
out
so
sharply
that
peterson
looked
at
him
in
slow
surprise
oh
nothing
he
said
a
darn
little
rat
of
a
walking
delegate
came
out
here
had
a
printed
card
with
business
agent
on
it
and
poked
his
long
nose
into
other
people
business
for
a
while
and
asked
the
men
questions
and
at
last
he
came
to
me
i
told
him
that
we
treated
our
men
all
right
and
did
need
no
help
from
him
and
if
i
ever
caught
him
out
here
again
i
carry
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
jim
pole
and
leave
him
there
he
went
fast
enough
i
wish
he
knocked
you
down
first
to
even
things
up
said
bannon
him
oh
i
could
have
handled
him
with
three
fingers
i
going
out
for
a
look
around
said
bannon
abruptly
he
left
peterson
still
smiling
over
the
incident
it
was
not
so
much
to
look
over
the
job
as
to
get
where
he
could
work
out
his
wrath
that
bannon
left
the
office
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
explain
to
peterson
what
he
had
done
for
even
if
he
could
be
made
to
understand
he
could
undo
nothing
bannon
had
known
a
good
many
walking
delegates
and
he
had
found
them
so
far
square
but
it
would
be
a
man
who
could
overlook
what
peterson
had
done
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
all
that
remained
was
to
wait
till
the
business
agent
should
make
the
next
move
so
bannon
put
the
whole
incident
out
of
his
mind
and
until
noon
inspected
the
job
in
earnest
by
the
time
the
whistle
blew
every
one
of
the
hundreds
of
men
on
the
job
save
peterson
himself
knew
that
there
was
a
new
boss
there
was
no
formal
assumption
of
authority
supremacy
was
established
simply
by
the
obvious
fact
that
he
was
the
man
who
knew
how
systematizing
the
confusion
in
one
corner
showing
another
gang
how
to
save
handling
a
big
stick
twice
finally
putting
a
runway
across
the
drillage
of
the
annex
and
doing
a
hundred
little
things
between
times
he
made
himself
master
the
afternoon
he
spent
in
the
little
office
and
by
four
had
seen
everything
there
was
in
it
plans
specifications
building
book
bill
file
and
even
the
pay
roll
the
cash
account
and
the
correspondence
the
clerk
who
was
also
timekeeper
exhibited
the
latter
rather
grudgingly
what
all
this
stuff
bannon
asked
holding
up
a
stack
of
unfiled
letters
letters
we
ai
answered
yet
well
we
answer
them
now
and
bannon
commenced
dictating
his
reply
to
the
one
on
top
of
the
stack
hold
on
said
the
clerk
i
ai
a
stenographer
so
said
bannon
he
scribbled
a
brief
memorandum
on
each
sheet
there
enough
to
go
by
he
said
answer
according
to
instructions
i
wo
have
time
to
do
it
till
some
time
i
do
it
if
i
were
you
said
bannon
significantly
then
he
began
writing
letters
himself
peterson
and
vogel
came
into
the
office
a
few
minutes
later
writing
a
letter
to
your
girl
said
peterson
jocularly
we
ought
to
have
a
stenographer

such
a
dude

sody
fountain
next
that
straight
said
bannon
we
ought
to
have
a
stenographer
for
a
fact
he
said
nothing
until
he
had
finished
and
sealed
the
two
letters
he
was
writing
they
were
as
follows

brown
it
a
mess

the
five
whistle
had
sounded

peterson
sat
on
the
bench
inside
the
office
door
while
bannon
washed
his
hands
in
the
tin
basin
the
twilight
was
already
settling
within
the
shanty
whose
dirty
windows
served
only
to
indicate
the
lesser
darkness
without
a
wall
lamp

in
a
dull
reflector

into
the
corners

balled
himself
up
by
this
time
the
two
men
had
their
coats
on
and
were
outside
the
building
let
see
said
bannon
we
go
this
way
do
we
yes
there
was
still
the
light
flying
flakes
of
snow
and
the
biting
wind
that
came
sweeping
down
from
the
northwest
the
two
men
crossed
the
siding
and
picking
their
way
between
the
freight
cars
on
the
belt
line
tracks
followed
the
path
that
wound
across
the
stretch
of
dusty
meadow
go
ahead
said
peterson
you
was
telling
about
murphy
well
that
was
the
situation
i
could
see
that
brown
was
up
on
his
hind
legs
about
it
but
it
made
me
tired
all
the
same
of
course
the
job
had
to
be
done
but
i
was
letting
him
have
any
satisfaction
i
told
him
he
ought
to
give
it
to
somebody
else
and
he
handed
me
a
lot
of
stuff
about
my
experience
finally
i
said
come
around
in
the
morning
brown
i
ai
had
any
sleep
to
speak
of
for
three
weeks
i
lost
pounds
i
said
i
ai
going
to
be
bothered
well
sir
he
kind
of
shook
his
head
but
he
went
away
and
i
got
to
thinking
about
it
long
about
seven
i
went
down
and
got
a
there
was
a
train
to
stillwater
at
that
night
sure
i
went
over
to
the
shops
with
an
express
wagon
and
got
a
thousand
feet
of
rope
had
it
in
two
coils
so
i
could
handle
it
and
just
made
the
train
it
was
a
mean
night
there
was
some
rain
when
i
started
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
it
when
i
got
to
stillwater
it
was
coming
down
in
layers
and
mud
that
sucked
your
feet
down
halfway
to
your
knees
there
was
a
wagon
anywhere
around
the
station
and
the
agent
lift
a
finger
it
was
blind
dark
i
walked
off
the
end
of
the
platform
and
went
plump
into
a
mudhole
i
waded
up
as
far
as
the
street
crossing
where
there
was
an
electric
light
and
ran
across
a
big
lumber
yard
and
hung
around
until
i
found
the
night
watchman
he
was
pretty
near
as
mean
as
the
station
agent
but
he
finally
let
me
have
a
wheelbarrow
for
half
a
dollar
and
told
me
how
to
get
to
the
job
he
called
it
fifty
rods
but
it
was
a
clean
mile
if
it
was
a
step
and
most
of
the
way
down
the
track
i
wheeled
her
back
to
the
station
got
the
rope
and
started
out
did
you
ever
try
to
shove
two
five
hundred
foot
coils
over
a
mile
of
crossties
well
that
what
i
did
i
scraped
off
as
much
mud
as
i
could
so
i
could
lift
my
feet
and
bumped
over
those
ties
till
i
thought
the
teeth
were
going
to
be
jarred
clean
out
of
me
after
i
got
off
the
track
there
was
a
stretch
of
mud
that
left
the
road
by
the
station
up
on
dry
land
there
was
a
fool
of
a
night
watchman
at
the
power
plant
i
reckon
he
thought
i
was
going
to
steal
the
turbines
but
he
finally
let
me
in
and
i
set
him
to
starting
up
the
power
while
i
cleaned
up
murphy
job
and
put
in
the
new
rope
all
by
yourself
asked
peterson
sure
thing
then
i
got
her
going
and
she
worked
smooth
as
grease
when
we
shut
down
and
i
came
up
to
wash
my
hands
it
was
five
minutes
of
three
i
said
there
a
train
back
to
minneapolis
before
very
long
says
the
watchman
fast
freight
goes
through
a
little
after
three
much
after
i
said
he
says
could
say
exactly
five
or
eight
minutes
i
guess
i
asked
when
the
next
train
went
and
he
said
there
was
a
regular
passenger
till
well
sir
maybe
you
think
i
was
going
to
wait
four
hours
in
that
hole
i
went
out
of
that
building
to
beat
the
limited
never
thought
of
the
wheelbarrow
till
i
was
halfway
to
the
station
and
there
was
some
of
the
liveliest
stepping
you
ever
saw
could
see
a
thing
except
the
light
on
the
rails
from
the
arc
lamp
up
by
the
station
i
got
about
halfway
there
running
along
between
the
rails
and
banged
into
a
switch
knocked
me
seven
ways
for
sunday
lost
my
hat
picking
myself
up
and
could
stop
to
find
it
peterson
turned
in
toward
one
of
a
long
row
of
square
frame
houses
here
we
are
he
said
as
they
went
up
the
stairs
he
asked
did
you
make
the
train
caught
the
caboose
just
as
she
was
swinging
out
they
dumped
me
out
in
the
freight
yards
and
i
did
get
home
till
five
i
went
right
to
bed
and
along
about
eight
brown
came
in
and
woke
me
up
he
was
feeling
pretty
nervous
charlie
he
said
it
time
for
you
to
be
starting
to
said
i
to
stillwater
he
said
ai
any
getting
out
of
it
that
drive
got
to
be
running
all
right
said
i
i
like
to
know
if
i
ca
have
one
day
rest
between
jobs
sunday
too
and
i
lost
pounds
well
sir
he
did
know
whether
to
get
hot
or
not
i
guess
he
thought
himself
they
were
kind
of
rubbing
it
in
here
he
said
you
going
to
stillwater
or
ai
you
said
i
ai
not
for
a
hundred
rope
drives
well
he
just
got
up
and
took
his
hat
and
started
out
brown
i
said
when
he
was
opening
the
door
lost
my
hat
down
at
stillwater
last
night
i
reckon
the
office
ought
to
stand
for
it
he
turned
around
and
looked
queer
and
then
he
grinned
you
went
over
he
said
reckon
i
did
said
i
kind
of
a
hat
did
you
lose
he
asked
and
he
grinned
again
guess
it
was
a
silk
one
was
it
said
i
silk
hat
something
about
eight
dollars
did
he
mean
he
give
you
a
silk
hat
asked
peterson
could
say
they
were
sitting
in
the
room
that
peterson
rented
for
a
dollar
a
week
bannon
had
the
one
chair
and
was
sitting
tipped
back
against
the
washstand
peterson
sat
on
the
bed
bannon
had
thrown
his
overcoat
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
had
dropped
his
bag
on
the
floor
by
the
window
ai
it
time
to
eat
pete
he
said
yes
there
the
bell
the
significance
of
bannon
arrival
and
the
fact
that
he
was
planning
to
stay
was
slow
in
coming
to
peterson
after
supper
when
they
had
returned
to
the
room
his
manner
showed
constraint
finally
he
said
is
there
any
fuss
up
at
the
office
what
about
why
do
they
want
to
rush
the
job
or
something
well
we
have
got
such
a
lot
of
time
you
see
it
november
already
what
the
hurry
all
of
a
sudden
they
did
say
nothing
to
me
i
guess
you
have
been
crowding
it
very
hard
have
you
peterson
flushed
i
been
working
harder
than
i
ever
did
before
he
said
if
it
was
for
the
cribbing
being
held
up
like
this
i
had
the
cupola
half
done
before
now
i
been
playing
in
hard
luck
bannon
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
would
take
to
get
the
cribbing
down
from
ledyard
not
very
long
if
it
was
rushed
i
should
think
a
couple
of
days
or
maybe
three
and
they
rush
it
all
right
when
they
can
get
the
cars
you
see
it
only
ten
or
eleven
hours
up
there
passenger
schedule
and
they
could
run
it
right
in
on
the
job
over
the
belt
line
it
the
belt
line
that
crosses
the
bridge
is
it
yes
bannon
spread
his
legs
apart
and
drummed
on
the
front
of
his
chair
what
the
other
line
he
asked
the
four
track
line
that
the
we
do
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
they
were
both
silent
for
a
time
the
flush
had
not
left
face
his
eyes
were
roving
over
the
carpet
lifting
now
and
then
to
bannon
face
with
a
quick
glance
guess
i
shave
said
bannon
do
you
get
hot
water
here
why
i
do
know
replied
peterson
i
generally
use
cold
water
the
folks
here
ai
very
obliging
kind
o
poor
you
know
bannon
was
rummaging
in
his
grip
for
his
shaving
kit
you
never
saw
a
razor
like
that
pete
he
said
just
heft
it
once
light
ai
it
said
peterson
taking
it
in
his
hand
you
bet
it
light
and
look
here
he
reached
for
it
and
drew
it
back
and
forth
over
the
palm
of
his
hand
that
the
only
stropping
i
ever
give
it
do
you
have
to
hone
it
no
sir
it
never
been
touched
to
a
stone
or
leather
you
just
get
up
and
try
it
once
those
whiskers
of
yours
wo
look
any
the
worse
for
a
chopping
peterson
laughed
and
lathered
his
face
while
bannon
put
an
edge
on
the
razor
testing
it
with
a
hair
say
that
about
the
best
yet
said
peterson
after
the
first
stroke
you
right
it
is
bannon
looked
on
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
took
a
railroad
pathfinder
from
his
grip
and
rapidly
turned
the
pages
peterson
saw
it
in
the
mirror
and
asked
between
strokes
what
are
you
going
to
do
looking
up
trains
while
peterson
was
splashing
in
the
washbowl
bannon
took
his
turn
at
the
mirror
how
the
duluth
job
getting
on
asked
peterson
when
bannon
had
finished
and
was
wiping
his
razor
all
right
done
just
a
little
millwright
work
left
and
some
cleaning
up
there
ai
any
marine
leg
on
the
house
is
there
no
how
big
a
house
is
it
eight
hundred
thousand
bushels
that
so
ai
half
as
big
as
this
one
is
it
guess
not
built
for
the
same
people
though
page
company
they
must
be
going
in
pretty
heavy
they
are
there
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
it
some
of
the
boys
up
at
the
office
say
there
going
to
be
fun
with
december
wheat
before
they
get
through
with
it
it
been
going
up
pretty
steadily
since
the
end
of
september
it
was
and
saturday
in
minneapolis
it
ai
got
up
quite
so
high
down
here
yet
but
the
boys
say
there
going
to
be
a
lot
of
money
in
it
for
somebody
be
a
kind
of
a
good
thing
to
get
in
on
eh
said
peterson
cautiously
maybe
for
those
that
like
to
put
money
in
wheat
i
got
no
money
for
that
sort
of
thing
myself
yes
of
course
was
peterson
quick
reply
a
fellow
does
want
to
run
them
kind
o
chances
i
do
believe
in
it
myself
the
fact
this
and
this
is
just
between
you
and
me
mind
you
i
do
know
anything
about
it
it
only
what
i
think
somebody
buying
a
lot
of
december
wheat
or
the
price
would
keep
going
up
and
got
a
notion
that
whoever
he
is
it
page
company
that
selling
it
to
him
that
just
putting
two
and
two
together
you
see
it
the
real
grain
that
the
pages
handle
and
if
they
sell
to
a
man
it
means
that
they
going
to
make
a
mighty
good
try
at
unloading
it
on
him
and
making
him
pay
for
it
that
all
i
know
about
it
i
see
the
pages
selling
or
what
looks
mighty
like
it
and
i
see
them
beginning
to
look
around
and
talk
on
the
quiet
about
crowding
things
a
little
on
their
new
houses
and
it
just
strikes
me
that
there
likely
to
be
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
wheat
coming
into
chicago
before
the
year
runs
out
and
if
so
why
there
got
to
be
a
place
to
put
it
when
it
gets
here
do
they
have
to
have
an
elevator
to
put
it
in
asked
peterson
they
deliver
it
in
the
cars
i
do
know
much
about
that
side
of
the
business
i
should
say
not
the
board
of
trade
wo
recognize
grain
as
delivered
until
it
has
been
inspected
and
stored
in
a
registered
house
when
would
the
house
have
to
be
ready
well
if
i
right
if
they
going
to
put
december
wheat
in
this
house
they
have
to
have
it
in
before
the
last
day
of
december
we
could
do
that
said
peterson
if
the
cribbing
was
here
bannon
who
had
stretched
out
on
the
bed
swung
his
feet
around
and
sat
up
the
situation
was
not
easy
but
he
had
been
sent
to
calumet
to
get
the
work
done
in
time
and
he
meant
to
do
it
now
about
this
cribbing
pete
he
said
we
got
to
have
it
before
we
can
touch
the
annex
i
guess
that
about
it
peterson
replied
i
been
figuring
a
little
on
this
bill
i
take
it
there
something
over
two
million
feet
altogether
is
that
right
it
something
like
that
could
say
exactly
max
takes
care
of
the
lumber
bannon
brows
came
together
you
ought
to
know
a
little
more
about
this
yourself
pete
you
the
man
that
building
the
house
i
guess
i
been
pushing
it
along
as
well
as
any
one
could
said
peterson
sullenly
that
all
right
i
ai
hitting
at
you
i
talking
business
all
now
if
vogel
right
this
cribbing
ought
to
have
been
here
fourteen
days
ago
fourteen
days
peterson
nodded
that
just
two
weeks
of
lost
time
how
you
been
planning
to
make
that
up
why
why
i
reckon
i
can
put
things
together
soon
i
get
the
cribbing
look
here
pete
the
office
has
contracted
to
get
this
house
done
by
a
certain
date
they
got
to
pay
for
every
day
that
we
run
over
that
date
there
no
getting
out
of
that
cribbing
or
no
cribbing
when
they
seeing
ten
or
twenty
thousand
dollars
slipping
out
of
their
hands
do
you
think
they
going
to
thank
you
for
telling
that
the
railroad
could
get
cars
they
do
care
what
the
matter
all
they
want
of
you
is
to
do
the
work
on
time
now
look
here
charlie
hold
on
pete
do
get
mad
it
facts
that
all
here
these
two
weeks
gone
you
see
that
all
right
enough
now
the
way
this
laid
out
a
man
got
to
make
every
day
count
right
from
the
start
if
he
wants
to
land
on
his
feet
when
the
house
is
done
maybe
you
think
somebody
up
in
the
sky
is
going
to
hand
you
down
a
present
of
two
extra
weeks
so
the
lost
time
wo
count
that
would
be
all
right
only
it
ai
very
likely
to
happen
well
said
peterson
what
are
you
getting
at
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
perhaps
you
think
it
easy
no
i
do
but
i
tell
you
what
to
do
in
the
first
place
you
want
to
quit
this
getting
out
on
the
job
and
doing
a
laborer
work
the
office
is
paying
out
good
money
to
the
men
that
should
do
that
you
know
how
to
lay
a
corbel
but
just
now
you
could
tell
me
how
much
cribbing
was
coming
you
paid
to
direct
this
whole
job
and
to
know
all
about
it
not
to
lay
corbels
if
you
put
in
half
a
day
swinging
a
sledge
out
there
on
the
spouting
house
how
you
going
to
know
that
the
lumber
bills
tally
and
the
carpenters
ai
making
mistakes
and
that
the
timber
piled
right
here
you
had
a
dozen
men
throwing
away
their
time
moving
a
lot
of
timber
that
ought
to
have
been
put
in
the
right
place
when
it
first
came
in
peterson
was
silent
now
pete
as
soon
as
you
got
the
work
moving
along
better
go
over
to
the
electric
light
company
and
see
about
having
the
whole
ground
wired
for
arc
lamps
so
we
can
be
ready
to
put
on
a
night
shift
the
minute
the
cribbing
comes
in
you
want
to
crowd
too
they
ought
to
have
it
ready
in
two
days
bannon
sat
for
a
moment
then
he
arose
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
going
to
leave
you
pete
he
said
as
he
put
on
his
collar
where
you
going
i
got
to
get
up
to
the
city
to
make
the
ten
train
i
going
up
to
ledyard
to
get
the
cribbing
be
back
in
a
couple
of
days
he
threw
his
shaving
kit
into
his
grip
put
on
his
overcoat
said
and
went
out
chapter
iii
next
morning
at
eight
charlie
bannon
walked
into
the
office
of
dennis
the
manager
of
the
ledyard
salt
and
lumber
company
i
bannon
he
said
of
macbride
company
come
up
to
see
why
you
do
get
out
our
bill
of
cribbing
told
you
by
letter
retorted
dennis
we
ca
get
the
cars
i
know
you
did
that
a
good
thing
to
say
in
a
letter
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
much
of
it
really
was
cut
it
all
cut
and
stacked
by
the
siding
taking
up
half
the
yard
want
to
see
it
bannon
smiled
and
nodded
here
a
good
cigar
for
you
he
said
and
you
a
good
fellow
but
i
think
i
like
to
see
the
cribbing
oh
that
all
right
laughed
dennis
i
have
said
the
same
thing
if
it
was
cut
come
out
this
way
bannon
followed
him
out
into
the
yard
there
it
is
said
the
manager
there
was
no
need
of
pointing
it
out
it
made
a
pile
more
than
three
hundred
feet
long
it
was
nothing
but
rough
hemlock
two
inches
thick
and
from
two
to
ten
inches
wide
intended
to
be
spiked
together
flatwise
for
the
walls
of
the
bins
but
its
bulk
was
impressive
bannon
measured
it
with
his
eye
and
whistled
i
wish
that
had
been
down
on
our
job
ten
days
ago
he
said
presently
i
be
taking
a
vacation
now
if
it
had
well
it
was
ready
then
you
can
tell
by
the
color
what
the
matter
with
the
anyway
they
do
seem
to
be
hauling
very
much
i
noticed
that
last
night
when
i
came
up
i
no
good
at
sleeping
on
the
train
search
me
said
dennis
they
tied
us
up
for
these
two
weeks
kicked
for
cars
and
the
old
man
that
sloan
he
kicked
but
here
we
are
yet
ca
move
hand
or
foot
who
sloan
oh
he
the
whole
thing
owns
the
first
national
bank
and
the
trolley
line
and
the
ledyard
salt
and
lumber
company
and
most
of
the
downtown
real
estate
where
can
i
find
him
is
he
in
town
i
guess
so
he
got
an
office
across
the
river
just
ask
anybody
where
the
sloan
building
is
likely
to
be
there
as
early
as
this
asked
bannon
looking
at
his
watch
sure
if
he
in
town
bannon
slipped
his
watch
into
his
pocket
much
obliged
he
said
glad
to
have
met
you
good
morning
and
turning
he
walked
rapidly
away
down
the
plank
wagon
road
in
sloan
office
he
stated
his
errand
as
briefly
as
on
the
former
occasion
adding
only
that
he
had
already
seen
dennis
i
guess
he
told
you
all
there
is
to
tell
said
the
magnate
we
make
the
give
us
cars
i
told
dennis
to
stir
up
as
hard
as
he
could
i
guess
we
have
to
wait
i
ca
wait
what
else
can
you
do
it
every
bit
as
bad
for
us
as
it
is
for
you
and
you
can
rest
assured
that
we
do
all
we
can
as
if
the
cadence
of
his
last
sentence
were
not
sufficiently
recognizable
as
a
formula
of
dismissal
he
picked
up
a
letter
that
lay
on
his
desk
and
began
reading
it
this
is
an
ordinary
kick
said
bannon
sharply
it
is
just
a
case
of
us
having
to
pay
a
big
delay
forfeit
there
a
reason
why
our
job
got
to
be
done
on
time
i
want
to
know
the
reason
why
the
wo
give
you
cars
it
ai
because
they
have
got
them
what
makes
you
say
that
because
there
three
big
strings
of
empties
within
twenty
miles
of
here
this
minute
i
saw
them
when
i
came
up
this
morning
for
a
minute
sloan
said
nothing
only
traced
designs
on
the
blotter
with
his
pencil
bannon
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
question
of
arousing
his
interest
at
last
he
spoke
i
suspected
that
there
was
something
in
the
wind
but
i
been
too
busy
with
other
things
to
tend
to
it
so
i
turned
it
over
to
dennis
perhaps
he
done
as
well
as
i
could
i
do
know
much
about
these
days
for
a
long
time
they
were
at
me
to
take
a
big
block
of
treasury
stock
but
the
road
seemed
to
me
in
bad
shape
so
i
would
go
in
lately
they
reorganized
have
got
a
lot
of
new
money
in
there
i
do
know
whose
but
they
let
me
alone
there
been
no
row
you
understand
that
ai
the
reason
they
tied
us
up
but
i
known
much
about
what
was
going
on
inside
would
they
be
likely
to
tell
you
if
you
asked
i
mean
if
you
took
it
to
headquarters
i
could
get
any
more
out
of
them
than
you
could
that
is
not
by
asking
i
guess
i
go
look
up
myself
where
can
i
find
anybody
that
knows
anything
the
division
offices
are
at
blake
city
that
only
about
twenty
miles
you
could
save
time
by
talking
over
the
not
me
said
bannon
in
a
case
like
this
i
could
express
myself
properly
unless
i
saw
the
fellow
i
was
talking
to
sloan
laughed
i
guess
you
right
but
i
call
up
the
division
superintendent
and
tell
him
you
coming
then
you
be
sure
of
finding
him
bannon
shook
his
head
i
find
him
with
his
little
speech
all
learned
no
i
take
my
chances
on
his
being
there
when
the
train
that
gives
me
fifteen
minutes
can
i
make
it
not
afoot
and
you
ai
likely
to
catch
a
car
i
drive
you
down
i
got
the
fastest
mare
in
pottawatomie
county
the
fact
that
the
had
been
rescued
from
its
poverty
and
was
about
to
be
developed
was
made
manifest
in
blake
city
by
the
modern
building
which
the
railroad
was
erecting
on
the
main
street
eventually
the
division
officials
were
to
be
installed
in
office
suites
of
mahogany
veneer
with
ground
glass
doors
lettered
in
gold
leaf
for
the
present
as
from
the
beginning
they
occupied
an
upper
floor
of
a
freight
warehouse
bannon
came
in
about
eleven
looked
briefly
about
and
seeing
that
one
corner
was
partitioned
off
into
a
private
office
he
ducked
under
the
hand
rail
intended
to
pen
up
ordinary
visitors
and
made
for
it
a
telegraph
operator
just
outside
the
door
asked
what
his
business
was
but
he
answered
merely
that
it
was
with
the
superintendent
and
went
in
he
expected
rather
rough
work
the
superintendent
of
a
railroad
or
of
a
division
has
to
do
with
the
employees
never
with
the
customers
and
his
professional
manner
is
not
likely
to
be
distinguished
by
suavity
so
he
unconsciously
squared
his
shoulders
when
he
said
i
bannon
of
macbride
company
the
superintendent
dismissed
his
stenographer
swept
with
his
arm
a
clear
space
on
the
desk
and
then
drummed
on
it
with
his
fingers
but
he
did
not
look
up
immediately
when
he
did
it
was
with
an
expression
of
grave
concern
bannon
he
said
i
mighty
sorry
i
do
anything
i
can
for
you
you
can
smoke
ten
cent
cigars
on
me
from
now
till
christmas
and
light
them
with
passes
anything
if
you
feel
like
that
said
bannon
we
can
fix
things
all
comfortable
in
three
minutes
all
i
want
is
cars
the
superintendent
shook
his
head
there
where
you
stump
me
he
said
i
have
got
mr
superintendent
that
what
they
told
me
in
chicago
and
what
they
told
me
at
ledyard
i
did
come
up
here
to
blake
city
to
be
told
the
same
thing
and
then
go
back
home
well
i
do
know
what
else
i
can
tell
you
that
just
the
size
of
it
i
hope
we
be
able
to
fix
you
in
a
few
days
but
we
ca
promise
anything
bannon
frowned
and
after
an
expectant
pause
the
superintendent
went
on
talking
vaguely
about
the
immense
rush
of
traffic
finally
he
asked
why
do
you
think
we
hold
you
up
if
we
had
the
cars
that
what
i
came
here
to
find
out
i
think
you
mistaken
about
not
having
them
the
superintendent
laughed
you
ca
expect
to
know
more
about
that
than
i
do
you
doubtless
understand
your
business
but
this
is
my
business
if
you
can
tell
me
where
the
cars
are
you
can
have
them
well
as
you
say
that
your
business
but
i
can
tell
you
there
a
big
string
of
empties
i
counted
fourteen
on
the
siding
at
victory
the
superintendent
looked
out
of
the
window
and
again
drummed
on
the
desk
when
he
spoke
again
his
manner
was
more
what
one
would
expect
from
a
division
superintendent
you
do
know
anything
about
it
when
we
want
advice
how
to
run
our
road
we
ask
you
for
it
victory
in
my
division
anyway
then
wire
the
general
manager
he
ought
to
know
something
about
it
wire
him
yourself
if
you
like
i
ca
bother
about
it
i
sorry
i
ca
do
anything
but
i
have
got
time
i
have
begun
sending
telegrams
yet
and
i
have
very
much
more
time
to
fool
away
i
like
to
have
you
find
out
if
the
ledyard
salt
and
lumber
company
can
have
those
cars
that
are
on
the
siding
at
victory
all
right
said
the
superintendent
rising
at
the
door
he
turned
back
to
ask
when
was
it
you
saw
them
bannon
decided
to
chance
it
yesterday
morning
he
said
the
superintendent
returned
presently
and
turning
to
his
desk
resumed
his
work
a
few
minutes
later
the
telegraph
operator
came
in
and
told
him
that
the
cars
at
victory
had
been
loaded
with
iron
truss
work
the
night
before
and
had
gone
off
down
the
state
just
too
late
was
i
said
bannon
that
hard
luck
he
went
to
the
window
and
staring
out
into
the
yards
began
tapping
idly
with
his
pencil
on
the
glass
the
office
door
was
open
and
when
he
paused
he
heard
the
telegraph
instrument
just
without
clicking
out
a
message
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
asked
the
superintendent
his
good
humor
was
returning
at
the
sight
of
his
visitor
perplexity
i
wish
you
just
wire
the
general
manager
once
more
and
ask
him
if
he
ca
possibly
let
us
have
those
cars
all
right
said
the
other
cheerfully
he
nodded
to
the
operator
for
the
ledyard
salt
and
lumber
company
he
said
bannon
dropped
into
a
chair
stretched
himself
and
yawned
sleepy
he
said
have
had
any
sleep
in
three
weeks
lost
pounds
if
you
fellows
had
only
got
that
cribbing
down
on
time
i
be
having
a
vacation
another
yawn
interrupted
him
the
telegraph
receiver
had
begun
giving
out
the
general
manager
answer
the
superintendent
looked
at
bannon
expecting
him
to
finish
his
sentence
but
he
only
yawned
again
bannon
eyes
were
half
closed
but
the
superintendent
thought
he
was
turning
a
little
toward
the
open
doorway
do
you
feel
cold
he
asked
i
shut
the
door
he
rose
quickly
and
started
toward
it
but
bannon
was
there
before
him
he
hesitated
his
hand
on
the
knob
why
do
you
shut
it
snapped
the
superintendent
i
think
i
i
think
i
send
a
telegram
here
a
blank
in
here
come
in
but
bannon
had
slipped
out
and
was
standing
beside
the
operator
table
from
the
doorway
the
superintendent
saw
him
biting
his
pencil
and
frowning
over
a
bit
of
paper
the
general
manager
message
was
still
coming
in
as
the
last
click
sounded
bannon
handed
his
message
to
the
operator
send
it
collect
he
said
with
that
he
strode
away
over
the
hand
rail
this
time
and
down
the
stairs
the
operator
carried
the
message
to
the
superintendent
it
seems
to
be
for
you
he
said
the
superintendent
read
div
supt
blake
city
tell
manager
it
takes
better
man
than
him
to
tie
us
up
macbride
company
bannon
had
nearly
an
hour
to
wait
for
the
next
train
back
to
ledyard
but
it
was
not
time
wasted
for
as
he
paced
the
smoky
waiting
room
he
arrived
at
a
fairly
accurate
estimate
of
the
meaning
of
the
general
manager
message
it
was
simply
a
confirmation
of
the
cautious
prediction
he
had
made
to
peterson
the
night
before
why
should
any
one
want
to
hinder
the
construction
of
an
elevator
in
chicago
these
days
except
to
prevent
its
use
for
the
formal
delivery
of
grain
which
the
buyer
did
not
wish
delivered
and
why
had
page
company
suddenly
ordered
a
million
bushel
annex
why
had
they
suddenly
become
anxious
that
the
elevator
should
be
ready
to
receive
grain
before
january
first
unless
they
wished
to
deliver
a
vast
amount
of
december
wheat
before
bannon
train
came
in
he
understood
it
all
a
clique
of
speculators
had
decided
to
corner
wheat
an
enterprise
nearly
enough
impossible
in
any
case
but
stark
madness
unless
they
had
many
millions
at
command
it
was
a
long
chance
of
course
but
after
all
not
wonderful
that
some
one
in
their
number
was
a
power
in
the
reorganized
already
the
immense
amount
of
wheat
in
chicago
was
testing
the
capacity
of
the
registered
warehouses
and
plainly
if
the
calumet
k
should
be
delayed
long
enough
it
might
prevent
page
company
from
carrying
out
their
contract
to
deliver
two
million
bushels
of
the
grain
even
though
it
were
actually
in
the
cars
in
chicago
bannon
knew
much
of
page
company
that
dotted
all
over
the
vast
wheat
tracts
of
minnesota
and
montana
were
their
little
receiving
elevators
where
they
bought
grain
of
the
farmers
that
miles
of
freight
cars
were
already
lumbering
eastward
along
the
railroad
lines
of
the
north
he
had
a
touch
of
imagination
and
something
of
the
enormous
momentum
of
that
northern
wheat
took
possession
of
him
it
would
come
to
chicago
and
he
must
be
ready
for
it
it
would
be
absurd
to
be
balked
by
the
refusal
of
a
little
road
up
in
michigan
to
carry
a
pile
of
planks
he
paused
before
the
grated
window
of
the
ticket
and
telegraph
office
and
asked
for
a
map
he
studied
it
attentively
for
a
while
then
he
sent
a
telegram
macbride
company
wants
to
tie
us
up
will
not
furnish
cars
to
carry
our
cribbing
ca
get
it
elsewhere
inside
of
three
weeks
find
out
if
page
will
any
bill
of
extras
i
send
in
for
bringing
it
down
if
so
can
they
have

or
more
steam
barges
at
manistogee
within
hours
wire
ledyard
hotel
bannon
it
was
an
hour
ride
back
to
ledyard
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
persuaded
the
head
waiter
to
give
him
something
to
eat
although
it
was
long
after
the
dinner
hour
as
he
left
the
dining
room
the
clerk
handed
him
two
telegrams
one
read

cribbing
down

the
other

for

page
chapter
iv
as
bannon
was
paying
for
his
dinner
he
asked
the
clerk
what
sort
of
a
place
manistogee
was
the
clerk
replied
that
he
had
never
been
there
but
that
he
understood
it
was
quite
a
lively
town
good
road
over
there
pretty
fair
that
means
you
can
get
through
if
you
lucky
the
clerk
smiled
it
wo
be
so
bad
you
see
we
been
getting
a
good
deal
of
rain
that
packs
down
the
sand
you
ought
to
get
there
all
right
were
you
thinking
of
driving
over
that
the
only
way
to
go
is
it
well
i
see
maybe
a
little
later
how
far
is
it
the
farmers
call
it
eighteen
miles
bannon
nodded
his
thanks
and
went
back
to
sloan
office
well
it
did
take
you
long
said
the
magnate
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
he
enjoyed
his
reputation
for
choler
and
as
bannon
told
him
what
he
had
discovered
that
morning
the
old
man
paced
the
room
in
a
regular
beat
pausing
every
time
he
came
to
a
certain
tempting
bit
of
blank
wall
to
deal
it
a
thump
with
his
big
fist
when
the
whole
situation
was
made
clear
to
him
he
stopped
walking
and
cursed
the
whole
system
from
the
ties
up
i
make
smart
for
that
he
said
they
haul
those
planks
whether
they
want
to
or
not
you
hear
me
say
it
there
a
law
that
covers
a
case
like
that
i
prosecute
they
see
whether
j
sloan
is
a
safe
kind
of
man
to
monkey
with
why
man
he
added
turning
sharply
to
bannon
why
do
you
get
mad
you
do
seem
to
care
no
more
than
the
angel
gabriel
illustration
he
cursed
the
whole
system
from
the
ties
up
i
do
care
a
damn
for
the
i
want
the
cribbing
do
you
worry
i
have
the
law
on
those
fellows
and
i
get
the
stuff
about
five
years
from
now
when
i
was
likely
enough
dead
what
the
best
way
to
get
it
according
to
your
idea
take
it
over
to
manistogee
in
wagons
and
then
down
by
barges
sloan
snorted
you
stand
a
chance
to
get
some
of
it
by
fourth
of
july
that
way
do
you
want
to
bet
on
that
proposition
sloan
made
no
reply
he
had
allowed
his
wrath
to
boil
for
a
few
minutes
merely
as
a
luxury
now
he
was
thinking
seriously
of
the
scheme
it
sounds
like
moonshine
he
said
at
last
but
i
do
know
as
it
is
how
are
you
going
to
get
your
barges
i
got
one
already
it
leaves
milwaukee
sloan
looked
him
over
i
wish
you
were
out
of
a
job
he
said
then
abruptly
he
went
on
where
are
your
wagons
coming
from
you
have
got
them
all
lined
up
in
the
yard
now
have
you
it
take
a
lot
of
them
i
know
it
well
we
get
all
there
are
in
ledyard
there
a
beginning
and
the
farmers
round
here
ai
so
very
fond
of
the
are
they
do
they
think
the
railroad
discriminates
against
them
and
ai
they
right
about
it
i
never
saw
a
farmer
yet
that
would
grab
a
chance
to
get
even
with
a
railroad
that
about
right
in
this
part
of
the
country
anyway
you
get
up
a
regular
circus
poster
saying
what
you
think
of
the
and
call
on
the
farmers
to
hitch
up
and
drive
to
your
lumber
yard
we
stick
that
up
at
every
crossroads
between
here
and
manistogee
sloan
was
scribbling
on
a
memorandum
pad
before
bannon
had
finished
speaking
he
made
a
false
start
or
two
but
presently
got
something
that
seemed
to
please
him
he
rang
for
his
office
boy
and
told
him
to
take
it
to
the
office
it
got
to
be
done
in
an
hour
said
bannon
that
when
the
procession
moves
he
added
as
sloan
looked
at
him
questioningly
the
other
nodded
in
an
hour
he
said
to
the
office
boy
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
an
hour
he
asked
as
the
boy
went
out
why
it
be
four
then
and
we
ought
to
start
for
manistogee
as
early
as
we
can
we
well
i
should
think
not
said
sloan
you
going
to
drive
me
over
with
that
fast
mare
of
yours
you
sloan
laughed
look
at
it
rain
out
there
best
thing
in
the
world
for
a
sand
road
said
bannon
and
we
wash
i
guess
both
been
wet
before
but
it
miles
over
there
to
thirty
bannon
looked
at
his
watch
we
ought
to
get
there
by
ten
i
should
think
ten
what
do
you
think
she
is
a
sawhorse
she
never
took
more
than
two
hours
to
manistogee
in
her
life
the
corners
of
bannon
mouth
twitched
expressively
sloan
laughed
again
i
guess
it
up
to
me
this
time
he
said
before
they
started
sloan
telephoned
to
the
office
to
tell
them
to
print
a
reproduction
of
his
poster
on
the
front
page
of
the
ledyard
crowd
their
news
a
little
wo
it
bannon
asked
sloan
shook
his
head
that
helps
out
in
great
shape
the
did
not
keep
them
waiting
the
moment
sloan
pulled
up
his
impatient
mare
before
the
office
door
the
editor
ran
out
in
the
rain
with
the
posters
they
pretty
wet
yet
he
said
that
all
right
i
only
want
a
handful
send
the
others
to
my
office
they
know
what
to
do
with
i
was
glad
to
print
them
the
editor
went
on
deferentially
you
have
expressed
our
opinion
of
the
m
exactly
guess
i
did
said
sloan
as
they
drove
away
the
reorganized
decided
they
did
want
to
carry
him
around
the
country
on
a
pass
bannon
pulled
out
one
of
the
sheets
and
opened
it
on
his
knee
he
whistled
as
he
read
the
first
sentence
and
swore
appreciatively
over
the
next
when
he
had
finished
he
buttoned
the
waterproof
apron
and
rubbed
his
wet
hands
over
his
knees
it
grand
he
said
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
sloan
spoke
to
the
mare
he
had
held
her
back
as
they
jolted
over
the
worn
pavement
of
cedar
blocks
but
now
they
had
reached
the
city
limits
and
were
starting
out
upon
the
sand
she
was
a
tall
sorrel
a
morgan
and
as
she
settled
into
her
stride
bannon
watched
her
admiringly
her
wet
flanks
had
the
dull
sheen
of
bronze
do
tell
me
said
sloan
that
michigan
roads
are
no
good
for
driving
you
never
had
anything
finer
than
this
in
your
life
they
sped
along
as
on
velvet
noiselessly
save
when
their
wheels
sliced
through
standing
pools
of
water
she
can
keep
this
up
till
further
notice
i
suppose
said
bannon
sloan
nodded
soon
they
reached
the
first
crossroad
there
was
a
general
store
at
one
corner
and
opposite
a
blacksmith
shop
sloan
pulled
up
and
bannon
sprang
out
with
a
hammer
a
mouthful
of
tacks
and
three
or
four
of
the
posters
he
put
them
up
on
the
sheltered
side
of
conspicuous
trees
left
one
with
the
storekeeper
and
another
with
the
smith
then
they
drove
on
they
made
no
pretence
at
conversation
bannon
seemed
asleep
save
that
he
was
always
ready
with
his
hammer
and
his
posters
whenever
sloan
halted
the
mare
the
west
wind
freshened
as
the
evening
came
on
and
dashed
fine
sleety
rain
into
their
faces
bannon
huddled
his
wet
coat
closer
about
him
sloan
put
the
reins
between
his
knees
and
pulled
on
a
pair
of
heavy
gloves
it
had
been
dark
for
half
an
hour
bannon
could
hardly
distinguish
the
moving
figure
of
the
mare
when
sloan
spoke
to
her
and
drew
her
to
a
walk
bannon
reached
for
his
hammer
no
crossroad
here
said
sloan
bridge
out
of
repair
we
got
to
fetch
a
circle
here
up
to
where
she
can
wade
it
hold
on
said
bannon
sharply
let
me
get
out
do
be
scared
we
make
it
all
right
we
yes
but
will
fifteen
hundred
feet
of
lumber
make
it
i
want
to
take
a
look
he
splashed
forward
in
the
dark
but
soon
returned
it
nothing
that
ca
be
fixed
in
two
hours
where
the
nearest
farmhouse
fifty
rods
up
the
road
to
your
right
again
bannon
disappeared
presently
sloan
heard
the
deep
challenge
of
a
big
dog
he
backed
the
buggy
around
up
against
the
wind
so
that
he
could
have
shelter
while
he
waited
then
he
pulled
a
spare
blanket
from
under
the
seat
and
threw
it
over
the
mare
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
he
saw
a
lantern
bobbing
toward
him
the
big
farmer
who
accompanied
bannon
held
the
lantern
high
and
looked
over
the
mare
it
her
all
right
he
said
then
he
turned
so
that
the
light
shone
full
in
sloan
face
good
evening
sloan
he
said
you
excuse
me
but
is
what
this
gentleman
tells
me
all
straight
guess
it
is
sloan
smiled
i
bank
on
him
myself
the
farmer
nodded
with
satisfaction
all
right
then
i
have
it
done
for
you
sloan
asked
no
questions
until
they
had
forded
the
stream
and
were
back
on
the
road
then
he
inquired
what
he
going
to
do
mend
the
bridge
i
told
him
it
had
to
be
done
said
he
could
had
any
lumber
could
think
of
it
i
told
him
to
pull
down
the
lee
side
of
his
house
if
necessary
said
you
give
him
the
lumber
to
build
an
annex
on
it
what
oh
it
all
right
send
the
bill
to
macbride
i
knew
your
name
would
go
down
and
mine
would
the
delay
had
proved
costly
and
it
was
seven
before
they
reached
the
manistogee
hotel
now
said
bannon
we
have
time
to
rub
down
the
mare
and
feed
her
before
i
ready
to
go
back
sloan
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
in
unfeigned
amazement
then
slowly
he
shook
his
head
all
right
i
no
quitter
but
i
will
say
that
i
glad
you
ai
coming
to
ledyard
to
live
bannon
left
the
supper
table
before
sloan
had
finished
and
was
gone
nearly
an
hour
it
all
fixed
up
he
said
when
he
returned
cinched
the
wharf
they
started
back
as
they
had
come
in
silence
bannon
crowding
as
low
as
possible
in
his
ulster
dozing
but
he
roused
when
the
mare
of
her
own
accord
left
the
road
at
the
detour
for
the
ford
you
do
need
to
do
that
he
said
the
bridge
is
fixed
so
they
drove
straight
across
the
mare
feeling
her
way
cautiously
over
the
planks
the
clouds
were
thinning
so
that
there
was
a
little
light
and
bannon
leaned
forward
and
looked
about
how
did
you
get
hold
of
the
message
from
the
general
manager
asked
sloan
abruptly
heard
it
i
can
read
morse
signals
like
print
used
to
work
for
the
grand
trunk
what
doing
boss
of
a
wrecking
gang
bannon
paused
presently
he
went
on
yes
there
was
two
years
when
i
slept
with
my
boots
on
did
know
a
quiet
minute
never
could
tell
what
i
was
going
to
get
up
against
i
never
saw
two
wrecks
that
were
anything
alike
there
was
a
junction
about
fifty
miles
down
the
road
where
they
used
to
have
collisions
regular
but
they
were
all
different
i
could
figure
out
what
i
was
going
to
do
till
i
was
on
the
ground
and
then
i
did
have
time
to
my
only
order
was
the
road
and
be
damn
quick
about
it
i
said
went
i
set
fire
to
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
mixed
freight
just
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
and
they
never
kicked
that
the
kind
of
life
for
me
though
no
nor
this
ai
either
i
want
to
be
quiet
i
never
had
a
chance
yet
and
i
been
looking
for
it
ever
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
like
to
get
a
little
farm
and
live
on
it
all
by
myself
i
raise
garden
truck
cabbages
and
such
and
take
piano
lessons
is
that
why
you
quit
the
grand
trunk
so
that
you
could
take
piano
lessons
sloan
laughed
as
he
asked
the
question
but
bannon
replied
seriously
why
not
exactly
there
was
a
little
friction
between
me
and
the
master
mechanic
so
i
resigned
i
did
exactly
resign
either
he
added
a
moment
later
i
wired
the
superintendent
to
go
to
hell
it
came
to
the
same
thing
i
worked
for
a
railroad
once
myself
said
sloan
was
a
hostler
in
the
at
syracuse
new
york
i
never
worked
up
any
higher
than
that
i
had
ambitions
to
be
promoted
to
the
presidency
but
it
seem
very
likely
so
i
gave
it
up
and
came
west
you
made
a
good
thing
of
it
you
seem
to
own
most
all
pottawatomie
county
pretty
much
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
how
to
do
it
i
have
worked
like
an
blast
furnace
ever
since
i
could
creep
and
never
slighted
a
job
yet
but
here
i
am
ca
call
my
soul
my
own
i
have
saved
fifteen
thousand
dollars
but
that
ai
enough
to
stop
with
i
do
see
why
i
do
own
a
county
too
there
some
luck
about
it
and
then
i
do
believe
you
look
very
sharp
for
opportunities
i
suppose
you
are
too
busy
you
got
a
chance
this
minute
to
turn
your
fifteen
thousand
to
fifty
maybe
lot
more
i
afraid
i
too
to
see
it
why
what
you
found
out
this
morning
was
the
straightest
kind
of
a
straight
tip
on
the
wheat
market
for
the
next
two
months
a
big
elevator
like
yours
will
be
almost
decisive
the
thing
right
in
your
own
hands
if
page
company
ca
make
that
delivery
why
fellows
who
buy
wheat
now
are
going
to
make
money
i
see
said
bannon
quickly
all
i
have
to
do
would
be
to
buy
all
the
wheat
i
could
get
trusted
for
and
then
hold
back
the
job
a
little
and
while
i
was
at
it
i
might
just
as
well
make
a
clean
job
and
walk
off
with
the
pay
roll
he
laughed
i
look
pretty
would
i
going
to
old
macbride
with
my
tail
between
my
legs
telling
him
that
the
job
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
could
get
it
done
on
time
he
look
me
over
and
say
you
a
liar
you
never
had
to
lay
down
yet
and
you
do
now
go
back
and
get
that
job
done
before
new
year
or
i
shoot
you
you
do
want
to
get
rich
that
the
trouble
with
you
said
sloan
and
he
said
it
almost
enviously
bannon
rode
to
manistogee
on
the
first
wagon
the
barge
was
there
so
the
work
of
loading
the
cribbing
into
her
began
at
once
there
were
numerous
interruptions
at
first
but
later
in
the
day
the
stream
of
wagons
became
almost
continuous
farmers
living
on
other
than
the
manistogee
roads
came
into
ledyard
and
hurried
back
to
tell
their
neighbors
of
the
chance
to
get
ahead
of
the
railroad
for
once
dennis
who
was
in
charge
at
the
yard
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
the
supply
of
empty
wagons
sloan
disappeared
early
in
the
morning
but
at
five
bannon
had
a
telephone
message
from
him
i
here
at
blake
city
he
said
raising
hell
the
general
manager
gets
here
at
nine
to
talk
with
me
they
feeling
nervous
about
your
getting
that
message
i
think
you
better
come
up
here
and
talk
to
him
so
a
little
after
nine
that
night
the
three
men
sloan
bannon
and
the
manager
sat
down
to
talk
it
over
and
the
fact
that
in
the
first
place
an
attempt
to
boycott
could
be
proved
and
in
the
second
that
page
company
were
getting
what
they
wanted
anyway
while
they
talked
a
long
procession
of
cribbing
was
creaking
along
by
lantern
light
to
manistogee
finally
convinced
the
manager
that
the
time
had
come
to
yield
as
gracefully
as
possible
he
means
it
this
time
said
sloan
when
he
and
bannon
were
left
alone
at
the
blake
city
hotel
to
talk
things
over
yes
i
think
he
does
if
he
do
i
come
up
here
again
and
have
a
short
session
with
him
chapter
v
illustration
layout
it
was
nearly
five
when
bannon
appeared
at
the
elevator
on
thursday
he
at
once
sought
peterson
well
what
luck
did
you
have
he
asked
did
you
get
my
message
your
message
oh
sure
you
said
the
cribbing
was
coming
down
by
boat
i
do
see
how
though
ledyard
ai
on
the
lake
well
it
coming
just
the
same
two
hundred
thousand
feet
of
it
what
have
you
done
about
it
oh
we
be
ready
for
it
soon
it
gets
here
they
were
standing
at
the
north
side
of
the
elevator
near
the
paling
fence
which
bounded
the
right
of
way
bannon
looked
across
the
tracks
to
the
wharf
the
pile
of
timber
was
still
there
did
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
railroad
when
you
took
your
stuff
across
for
the
spouting
house
he
asked
not
much
of
any
the
section
boss
came
around
and
talked
a
little
but
we
only
opened
the
fence
in
one
place
and
that
seemed
to
suit
him
bannon
was
looking
about
calculating
with
his
eye
the
space
that
was
available
for
the
incoming
lumber
how
you
manage
that
business
anyway
asked
peterson
what
business
the
cribbing
how
you
get
it
to
the
lake
oh
that
was
easy
i
just
carried
it
off
yes
you
did
look
here
pete
that
timber
has
got
any
business
out
there
on
the
wharf
we
got
to
have
that
room
for
the
cribbing
that
all
right
the
steamer
wo
get
in
much
before
night
will
it
we
are
doing
any
banking
on
that
i
got
a
notion
that
the
pages
are
sending
out
any
scow
to
do
their
quick
work
that
timber
got
to
come
over
here
may
as
well
put
it
where
the
carpenters
can
get
right
at
it
we
be
on
the
cupola
before
long
anyhow
but
it
five
already
there
the
whistle
bannon
waited
while
the
long
blast
sounded
through
the
crisp
air
then
he
said
offer
the
men
double
pay
and
tell
them
that
any
man
can
go
home
that
wants
to
right
now
but
if
they
say
they
stay
they
got
to
see
it
through
already
the
laborers
were
hurrying
toward
the
tool
house
in
a
long
irregular
line
peterson
started
toward
the
office
to
give
the
word
to
the
men
before
they
could
hand
in
their
time
checks
mr
bannon
the
foreman
turned
vogel
was
approaching
i
wanted
to
see
about
that
cribbing
bill
how
much
of
it
coming
down
by
boat
two
hundred
thousand
you
better
help
peterson
get
that
timber
out
of
the
way
we
holding
the
men
yes
i
been
waiting
for
directions
about
that
we
can
put
a
big
gang
on
it
and
snake
it
across
in
no
time
you
have
to
open
up
the
fence
in
half
a
dozen
places
and
put
on
every
man
you
got
there
no
use
in
making
an
job
of
it
i
afraid
we
have
trouble
with
the
railroad
no
we
wo
if
they
kick
you
send
them
to
me
are
your
arc
lights
in
yes
all
but
one
or
two
they
were
going
to
finish
it
but
they
ai
very
spry
about
it
tell
you
what
you
do
max
you
call
them
up
and
tell
them
we
want
a
man
to
come
out
here
and
stay
for
a
while
i
may
want
to
move
the
lights
around
a
little
and
anyhow
they
may
as
well
clean
up
their
job
and
have
it
done
with
he
was
starting
back
after
the
returning
laborers
when
max
said
mr
bannon
hello
i
heard
you
speaking
about
a
stenographer
the
other
day
yes
what
about
it
have
you
got
one
yet
no
but
i
know
of
one
that
could
do
the
work
i
want
a
good
one
he
got
to
keep
time
besides
doing
the
office
work
yes
i
thought
of
that
i
do
suppose
she
she
we
ca
have
any
shes
on
this
job
well
it
like
this
bannon
she
an
stenographer
and
bookkeeper
and
as
for
keeping
the
time
why
i
out
on
the
job
all
day
anyhow
and
i
reckon
i
could
take
care
of
it
without
cutting
into
my
work
bannon
looked
quizzically
down
at
him
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
said
slowly
just
look
around
at
this
gang
of
men
you
know
the
likes
of
them
as
well
as
i
do
and
then
talk
to
me
about
bringing
a
girl
on
the
job
he
his
head
i
reckon
it
some
one
you
interested
in
yes
said
max
it
my
sister
max
evidently
did
not
intend
to
be
turned
off
as
he
stood
awaiting
a
reply
his
broad
flat
features
his
long
arms
and
bow
legs
with
their
huge
hands
and
feet
his
fringe
of
hair
cropping
out
behind
his
cap
each
contributing
to
the
general
appearance
of
utter
homeliness
a
faint
smile
came
over
bannon
face
the
thought
was
in
his
mind
if
she
looks
anything
like
that
i
guess
safe
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
abruptly
when
can
she
start
right
away
all
right
we
try
it
for
a
day
or
so
and
see
how
it
goes
tell
that
boy
in
the
office
that
he
can
charge
his
time
up
to
saturday
night
but
he
need
stay
around
any
longer
max
hurried
away
group
after
group
of
laborers
peavies
or
on
shoulders
were
moving
slowly
past
him
toward
the
wharf
it
was
already
nearly
dark
and
the
arc
lights
on
the
elevator
structure
and
on
the
spouting
house
beyond
the
tracks
were
flaring
he
started
toward
the
wharf
walking
behind
a
score
of
the
laborers
from
the
east
over
the
flats
and
marshes
through
which
the
narrow
sluggish
river
wanders
to
lake
michigan
came
the
hoarse
whistle
of
a
steamer
bannon
turned
and
looked
his
view
was
blocked
by
some
freight
cars
that
were
standing
on
the
c
tracks
at
some
distance
to
the
east
he
ran
across
the
tracks
and
out
on
the
wharf
climbing
on
the
timber
pile
where
peterson
and
his
gang
were
rolling
down
the
big
sticks
with
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
was
a
big
steamer
ploughing
slowly
up
the
river
the
cough
of
her
engines
and
the
swash
of
the
churning
water
at
her
bow
and
stern
could
be
plainly
heard
peterson
stopped
work
for
a
moment
and
joined
him
well
bannon
said
we
in
for
it
now
i
never
thought
they
make
such
time
as
this
she
can
lay
up
here
all
night
till
morning
i
guess
bannon
was
thinking
hard
no
he
finally
said
she
ca
there
ai
any
use
of
wasting
all
day
unloading
that
cribbing
and
getting
it
across
peterson
too
was
thinking
and
his
were
coming
together
in
a
puzzled
scowl
oh
he
said
you
mean
to
do
it
yes
sir
we
do
get
any
sleep
till
every
piece
of
that
cribbing
is
over
at
the
annex
ready
for
business
in
the
morning
your
sills
are
laid
there
nothing
in
the
way
of
starting
those
bins
right
up
this
ai
an
job
if
we
hustle
it
the
steamer
was
a
big
lake
barge
with
high
bow
and
stern
and
a
long
low
cargo
deck
amidships
that
was
piled
squarely
and
high
with
yellow
plank
her
crew
had
clearly
been
impressed
with
the
need
of
hurry
for
long
before
she
could
be
worked
into
the
wharf
they
had
rigged
the
two
hoists
and
got
the
donkey
engines
into
running
order
the
captain
stood
by
the
rail
on
the
bridge
smoking
a
cigar
his
hand
on
the
where
do
you
want
it
he
called
to
bannon
right
here
where
i
standing
you
can
swing
your
bow
in
just
below
the
bridge
there
the
captain
pulled
the
bell
and
the
craft
stirring
up
a
whirl
of
mud
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
was
brought
alongside
the
wharf
where
are
you
going
to
put
it
the
captain
called
here
we
clean
this
up
as
fast
as
we
can
i
want
that
cribbing
all
unloaded
sure
that
suits
me
said
the
captain
i
do
want
to
be
held
up
here
ought
to
pull
out
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
all
right
you
can
do
it
bannon
turned
to
peterson
and
vogel
who
had
just
reached
the
wharf
you
want
to
rush
this
boys
i
go
over
and
see
to
the
piling
he
hurried
away
pausing
at
the
office
long
enough
to
find
the
man
sent
by
the
electric
light
company
and
to
set
him
at
work
the
arc
lamps
had
been
placed
for
the
most
part
where
they
would
best
illuminate
the
annex
and
the
cupola
of
the
elevator
and
there
was
none
too
much
light
on
the
tracks
where
the
men
were
stumbling
along
hindered
rather
than
helped
by
the
bright
light
before
them
on
the
wharf
it
was
less
dark
for
the
lights
of
the
steamer
were
aided
by
two
on
the
spouting
house
before
seven
bannon
had
succeeded
in
getting
two
more
lights
up
on
poles
one
on
each
side
of
the
track
it
was
just
at
seven
that
the
timbers
suddenly
stopped
coming
in
bannon
looked
around
impatiently
the
six
men
that
had
brought
in
the
last
stick
were
disappearing
around
the
corner
of
the
great
shadowy
structure
that
shut
off
bannon
view
of
the
wharf
he
waited
for
a
moment
but
no
more
gangs
appeared
and
then
he
ran
around
the
elevator
over
the
path
the
men
had
already
trampled
within
the
circle
of
light
between
him
and
the
tracks
stood
scattered
groups
of
the
laborers
and
others
wandered
about
with
their
hooks
over
their
shoulders
there
was
a
larger
less
distinct
crowd
out
on
the
tracks
bannon
ran
through
an
opening
in
the
fence
and
pushed
into
the
largest
group
here
peterson
and
vogel
were
talking
to
a
man
with
a
sandy
mustache
what
does
this
mean
pete
he
said
shortly
we
ca
be
held
up
this
way
get
your
men
back
on
the
work
no
he
wo
said
the
third
man
you
ca
go
on
with
this
work
bannon
sharply
looked
the
man
over
there
was
in
his
manner
a
dogged
authority
who
are
you
bannon
asked
who
do
you
represent
i
represent
the
railroad
and
i
tell
you
this
work
stops
right
here
why
the
man
waved
his
arm
toward
the
fence
you
ca
do
that
sort
of
business
what
sort
you
look
at
that
fence
and
then
talk
to
me
about
what
sort
what
the
matter
with
the
fence
what
the
matter
with
it
there
ai
a
rod
of
it
left
what
bannon
scowl
relaxed
oh
he
said
i
see

the
section
boss
ai
you
yes
that
all
right
then
come
over
here
and
i
show
you
how
we
got
things
fixed
he
walked
across
the
track
followed
by
the
section
boss
and
pete
and
pointed
out
the
displaced
sections
of
the
fence
each
of
which
had
been
carefully
placed
at
one
side
we
have
it
all
up
all
right
before
morning
he
said
the
man
was
running
his
fingers
up
under
his
cap
i
do
know
anything
about
that
he
replied
sullenly
i
got
my
orders
we
did
make
any
kick
when
you
opened
up
in
one
place
but
we
ca
stand
for
all
this
he
was
not
speaking
firmly
and
bannon
watching
him
closely
jumped
at
the
conclusion
that
his
orders
were
not
very
definite
probably
his
superintendent
had
instructed
him
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
work
and
perhaps
to
grant
no
privileges
bannon
wished
he
knew
more
about
the
understanding
between
the
railroad
and
macbride
company
he
felt
sure
however
that
an
understanding
did
exist
or
he
would
not
have
been
told
to
go
ahead
that
all
right
he
said
with
an
air
of
easy
authority
we
got
to
be
working
over
your
tracks
for
the
next
two
months
it
as
much
to
our
interest
as
it
is
to
yours
to
be
careful
and
i
guess
we
can
pull
together
we
got
an
agreement
with
your
general
manager
and
what
goes
he
turned
away
but
paused
and
added
i
see
that
you
do
have
any
reason
to
complain
the
section
boss
looked
about
with
an
uncertain
air
at
the
crowd
of
waiting
men
do
go
too
fast
there
he
began
look
here
said
bannon
abruptly
we
sit
right
down
here
and
send
a
message
to
the
general
manager
that
the
quickest
way
to
settle
it
tell
him
that
we
carrying
out
timber
across
the
tracks
and
stopped
us
it
was
a
bluff
but
bannon
knew
his
man
now
how
about
this
was
the
reply
how
long
will
it
take
you
till
some
time
before
daylight
bannon
was
feeling
for
his
pencil
you
see
that
the
fence
goes
back
will
you
we
ai
taking
any
chances
you
understand
bannon
nodded
all
right
max
he
shouted
get
to
work
there
and
look
here
max
in
a
stern
voice
i
expect
you
to
see
that
the
road
is
not
blocked
or
delayed
in
any
way
that
your
business
now
mind
he
turned
to
the
boss
as
the
men
hurried
past
to
the
wharf
i
used
to
be
a
railroad
man
myself
chief
wrecker
on
the
grand
trunk
and
i
guess
we
wo
have
any
trouble
understanding
each
other
again
the
six
long
lines
of
men
were
creeping
from
the
brightly
lighted
wharf
across
the
shadowy
tracks
and
around
the
end
of
the
elevator
bannon
had
held
the
electric
light
man
within
call
and
now
set
him
at
work
moving
two
other
arc
lamps
to
a
position
where
they
made
the
ground
about
the
growing
piles
of
timber
nearly
as
light
as
day
through
the
night
air
he
could
hear
the
thumping
of
the
planks
on
the
wharf
faintly
over
this
sound
came
the
shouting
of
men
and
the
tramp
and
shuffle
of
feet
and
at
intervals
a
train
would
rumble
in
the
distance
slowly
coming
nearer
until
with
a
roar
that
swallowed
all
the
other
noises
it
was
past
the
arc
lamps
glowed
and
buzzed
over
the
heads
of
the
sweating
grunting
men
as
they
came
along
the
path
gang
after
gang
lifting
an
end
of
a
heavy
stick
to
the
level
of
the
steadily
rising
pile
and
sliding
it
home
bannon
knew
from
long
experience
how
to
pile
the
different
sizes
so
that
each
would
be
ready
at
the
hands
of
the
carpenters
when
the
morning
whistle
should
blow
he
was
all
about
the
work
giving
a
hand
here
an
order
there
always
though
brusque
and
always
inspiring
the
men
with
the
sight
of
his
own
activity
toward
the
middle
of
the
evening
vogel
came
up
from
the
wharf
with
a
question
as
he
was
about
to
return
bannon
who
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
incident
of
the
section
boss
said
wait
a
minute
max
what
about
this
railroad
business
have
they
bothered
you
much
before
now
not
very
much
only
in
little
ways
i
guess
it
just
this
section
boss
that
does
it
on
his
own
hook
he
a
sort
of
a
fool
you
know
and
got
it
into
his
head
that
we
trying
to
do
him
some
way
bannon
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
studied
the
checkered
pattern
in
the
ground
shadow
of
the
nearest
arc
lamp
then
he
slowly
shook
his
head
no
he
said
that
ai
it
he
too
big
a
fool
to
do
much
on
his
own
hook
he
acting
on
orders
of
some
sort
and
that
just
what
i
understand
as
a
general
thing
a
railroad
mighty
white
to
an
elevator
come
to
think
of
it
they
said
something
about
it
up
at
the
office
he
was
apparently
speaking
to
himself
and
max
quietly
waited
brown
said
something
about
the
having
got
in
the
way
a
little
down
here
but
i
did
think
much
about
it
at
the
time
what
could
they
do
max
asked
a
lot
if
they
wanted
to
but
that
ai
what
bothering
me
they
have
any
connection
with
the
have
they
no
max
shook
his
head
no
not
that
i
know
of
well
it
funny
that
all
the
man
behind
those
orders
that
the
section
boss
talks
about
is
the
general
manager
and
it
my
notion
that
we
likely
to
hear
from
him
again
i
tell
you
what
it
is
somebody
i
do
know
who
but
somebody
is
mighty
eager
to
keep
this
house
from
being
finished
by
the
first
of
january
after
this
i
wish
you
keep
your
eyes
open
for
this
section
boss
have
you
had
any
trouble
with
the
men
no
only
that
clerk
that
we
laid
off
he
he
was
going
to
make
trouble
i
did
say
anything
about
it
because
they
always
talk
like
that
yes
i
know
what
his
name
briggs
i
guess
he
ca
hurt
us
any
bannon
turned
back
to
his
work
and
vogel
disappeared
in
the
shadows
along
the
path
nine
came
and
the
timber
was
still
coming
in
the
men
were
growing
tired
and
surly
from
the
merciless
strain
of
carrying
the
long
heavy
sticks
the
night
was
raw
and
chill
bannon
felt
it
as
he
stood
directing
the
work
and
he
kept
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
wished
he
had
worn
his
overcoat
but
the
laborers
barearmed
and
clad
only
in
overalls
or
in
thin
trousers
and
cotton
shirts
were
shaking
sweat
from
their
eyes
and
stealing
moments
between
trips
to
stand
where
the
keen
lake
breeze
could
cool
them
another
or
so
should
see
the
last
stick
on
the
piles
and
bannon
had
about
decided
to
go
over
to
the
office
when
he
saw
vogel
moving
among
the
men
marking
their
time
in
his
book
here
max
he
called
adding
when
vogel
had
reached
his
side
just
keep
an
eye
on
this
will
you
i
be
at
the
office
keep
things
going
just
as
they
are
there
was
a
light
in
the
office
bannon
stepped
into
the
doorway
and
with
a
suppressed
word
of
impatience
stood
looking
at
the
scene
within
the
desk
that
peterson
had
supplied
for
the
use
of
his
clerk
was
from
the
floor
built
against
the
wall
with
a
high
stool
before
it
the
wall
lamp
had
been
taken
down
now
it
stood
with
its
reflector
on
the
top
of
the
desk
which
was
covered
with
books
and
papers
a
girl
was
sitting
on
the
stool
bending
over
a
ledger
and
rapidly
footing
up
columns
bannon
could
not
see
her
face
for
a
young
fellow
stood
leaning
over
the
railing
by
the
desk
his
back
to
the
door
he
had
just
said
something
and
now
he
was
laughing
in
a
conscious
manner
bannon
quietly
stepped
to
one
side
the
girl
looked
up
for
a
moment
and
brushed
her
hair
back
from
her
face
the
fellow
spoke
again
in
a
low
tone
but
beyond
a
slight
compressing
of
her
lips
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
without
a
word
bannon
came
forward
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
out
of
the
door
still
holding
his
arm
he
took
a
step
back
and
they
stood
in
the
outer
circle
of
the
electric
light
looked
him
over
let
see
he
said
you
the
man
that
was
clerking
here
there
was
no
reply
and
your
name
what
briggs
well
briggs
did
you
get
a
message
from
me
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
the
young
man
his
eyes
on
the
ground
max
he
come
around
but
i
wanted
to
wait
and
see
you
he
a
mean
cuss
you
see
me
now
do
you
yes
the
reply
was
indistinct
you
keep
out
of
the
office
after
this
if
i
catch
you
in
there
again
i
wo
stop
to
talk
now
clear
out
briggs
walked
a
little
way
then
turned
maybe
you
think
you
can
lay
me
off
without
notice
but
you
wish
bannon
turned
back
to
the
office
giving
no
heed
to
briggs
last
words
i
got
you
fixed
already
he
was
thinking
of
the
girl
there
on
the
stool
she
did
not
look
like
the
girl
he
had
expected
to
see
to
be
sure
her
hair
was
red
but
it
was
not
of
the
red
that
outcropped
from
big
head
it
was
of
a
dark
rich
color
and
it
had
caught
the
light
from
the
lamp
with
such
a
shine
as
there
is
in
new
red
gold
when
he
entered
she
was
again
footing
columns
she
was
slender
and
her
hand
where
it
supported
her
forehead
was
white
again
bannon
stood
motionless
slowly
shaking
his
head
then
he
came
forward
she
heard
his
step
and
looked
up
as
if
to
answer
a
question
letting
her
eyes
rest
on
his
face
he
hesitated
and
she
quietly
asked
what
is
it
please
miss
vogel
yes
i
bannon
there
was
any
need
of
your
working
just
keeping
the
men
on
so
we
can
get
in
this
cribbing
when
did
you
come
my
brother
telephoned
to
me
i
wanted
to
look
things
over
before
starting
in
how
do
you
find
it
she
hesitated
glancing
over
the
jumble
of
papers
on
the
desk
it
has
been
kept
up
very
well
she
presently
said
but
it
wo
be
hard
i
think
to
straighten
it
out
bannon
leaned
on
the
rail
and
glanced
at
the
paper
on
which
she
had
been
setting
down
totals
i
guess
you
better
go
home
miss
vogel
it
after
nine
i
can
finish
in
an
hour
you
better
go
there
be
chances
enough
for
night
work
without
your
making
them
she
smiled
cleared
up
the
desk
and
reached
for
her
jacket
which
hung
from
the
nail
behind
her
then
she
paused
i
thought
i
would
wait
for
my
brother
mr
bannon
that
all
right
i
guess
we
can
spare
him
i
speak
to
him
do
you
live
far
no
max
and
i
are
boarding
at
the
same
place
he
had
got
to
the
door
when
she
asked
shall
i
put
out
the
light
he
turned
and
nodded
she
was
drawing
on
her
gloves
she
perhaps
was
not
a
very
pretty
girl
but
there
was
something
in
her
manner
as
she
stood
there
in
the
dim
light
her
hair
straying
out
from
beneath
her
white
sombrero
hat
that
for
the
moment
took
bannon
far
away
from
this
environment
of
railroad
tracks
and
lumber
piles
he
waited
till
she
came
out
then
he
locked
the
door
i
walk
along
with
you
myself
if
you
do
mind
he
said
and
after
they
had
crossed
the
belt
line
tracks
and
he
had
helped
her
with
a
little
laugh
from
each
of
them
to
pick
her
way
over
the
switches
and
between
the
freight
cars
he
said
you
do
look
much
like
your
brother
it
was
not
a
long
walk
to
the
boarding
house
but
before
they
had
reached
it
bannon
was
nervous
it
was
not
a
custom
with
him
to
leave
his
work
on
such
an
errand
he
bade
her
a
brusque
and
hurried
back
pausing
only
after
he
had
crossed
the
tracks
to
cast
his
eye
over
the
timber
there
was
no
sign
of
activity
though
the
two
arc
lamps
were
still
in
place
all
in
eh
he
said
he
followed
the
path
beside
the
elevator
and
on
around
the
end
and
then
with
an
exclamation
he
hurried
forward
for
there
was
the
same
idle
crowd
about
the
tracks
that
had
been
there
during
the
trouble
with
the
section
boss
the
same
buzz
of
talk
and
the
idle
laughter
and
shouting
as
he
ran
his
foot
struck
a
and
he
sprawled
forward
for
nearly
a
rod
before
recovering
his
balance
then
he
stopped
and
looked
along
the
ground
a
long
line
of
timbers
lay
end
to
end
the
timber
hooks
across
them
or
near
by
on
the
ground
where
they
had
been
dropped
by
the
laborers
on
along
the
path
through
the
fence
openings
and
out
on
the
tracks
lay
the
lines
of
timber
here
and
there
bannon
passed
gangs
of
men
lounging
on
the
ground
waiting
for
the
order
to
move
on
as
he
passed
through
the
fence
walking
on
the
timbers
and
hurried
through
the
crowd
which
had
been
pushed
back
close
to
the
fence
he
heard
a
low
laugh
that
came
along
like
a
wave
from
man
to
man
in
a
moment
he
was
in
front
of
them
all
the
middle
tracks
were
clear
excepting
a
group
of
three
or
four
men
who
stood
a
little
to
one
side
bannon
could
not
make
them
out
another
crowd
of
laborers
was
pressed
back
against
the
opposite
fence
these
had
moved
apart
at
one
of
the
fence
openings
and
as
bannon
looked
two
men
came
through
stumbling
and
staggering
under
a
long
timber
which
they
were
carrying
on
their
shoulders
bannon
looked
sharply
the
first
a
big
man
and
in
his
shirt
sleeves
was
peterson
bannon
started
forward
when
max
who
had
been
hurrying
over
to
him
touched
his
arm
what
all
this
max
i
glad
you
come
it
grady
the
walking
delegate
that
him
over
there
where
those
men
are
standing
the
little
fellow
with
his
hat
on
one
side
he
been
here
for
ten
minutes
speak
quick
what
the
trouble
first
he
wanted
to
know
how
much
we
were
paying
the
men
for
night
work
and
i
told
him
thought
i
might
as
well
be
civil
to
him
then
he
said
we
got
to
take
briggs
back
and
i
told
him
briggs
was
a
union
man
and
he
had
anything
to
say
about
it
he
and
briggs
seemed
to
know
each
other
finally
he
came
out
here
on
the
job
and
said
we
were
working
the
men
too
hard
said
we
have
to
put
ten
men
on
the
heavy
sticks
and
eight
on
the
others
i
was
going
to
do
it
but
peterson
came
up
and
said
he
would
do
it
and
grady
called
the
men
off
just
where
they
were
he
would
let
lift
a
finger
you
see
there
timber
all
over
the
tracks
then
pete
got
mad
and
said
him
and
donnelly
could
bring
a
stick
over
alone
and
it
was
all
rot
about
putting
on
more
men
here
they
come
just
look
at
pete
arms
he
could
lift
a
house
some
of
the
men
were
laughing
others
growling
but
all
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
peterson
and
donnelly
as
they
came
across
the
tracks
slowly
picking
their
way
and
shifting
the
weight
a
little
at
every
few
seconds
on
their
shoulders
bannon
was
glancing
swiftly
about
taking
in
the
situation
he
would
not
imperil
his
discipline
by
reproving
peterson
before
the
men
so
he
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
until
the
task
should
be
accomplished
it
briggs
that
did
the
whole
business
max
was
saying
he
brought
the
delegate
around
he
was
blowing
about
it
among
the
men
when
i
found
him
is
he
on
the
job
now
bannon
asked
no
and
i
do
think
he
be
around
again
very
soon
there
were
some
loafers
with
him
and
they
took
him
away
peterson
and
donnelly
had
disappeared
through
the
fence
and
a
few
of
the
crowd
were
following
to
see
them
get
the
timber
clear
around
the
building
to
the
pile
have
you
sent
out
flagmen
max
bannon
asked
no
i
did
get
at
it
quick
send
a
man
each
way
with
a
lantern
put
something
red
over
them
their
shirts
if
necessary
none
of
the
men
will
dare
do
it
while
the
delegate
here
find
some
one
take
one
side
yourself
if
you
have
to
max
hurried
away
for
the
lanterns
bannon
walked
out
to
the
group
of
men
on
the
middle
tracks
where
mr
grady
he
said
one
of
the
men
pointed
but
the
delegate
gave
no
attention
you
grady
are
you
said
bannon
i
bannon
of
macbride
company
what
the
trouble
here
the
delegate
was
revelling
in
his
authority
his
manner
was
not
what
it
was
to
be
when
he
should
know
bannon
better
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
wharf
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
he
said
curtly
than
what
than
what
than
running
a
job
the
way
this
is
run
i
think
i
can
run
this
job
said
bannon
quietly
you
have
told
me
what
the
trouble
yet
it
right
here
you
trying
to
make
money
by
putting
on
one
man
to
do
the
work
of
two
how
bannon
quiet
manner
exasperated
the
delegate
use
your
eyes

eight
men
carry
a
stick
how
many
shall
i
put
on
ten
all
right
and
you
better
put
eight
men
on
the
other
sticks
the
delegate
looked
up
nettled
that
bannon
should
yield
so
easily
that
all
right
said
bannon
we
are
fighting
the
union
after
this
if
you
got
anything
to
say
i
wish
you
come
to
me
with
it
before
you
call
off
the
men
is
there
anything
else
before
i
start
up
grady
was
chewing
the
stub
of
a
cigar
he
stood
looking
about
with
an
ugly
air
then
he
said
you
ai
starting
up
just
yet
why
not
the
delegate
reply
was
lost
in
the
shout
that
suddenly
went
up
from
the
western
end
of
the
line
of
laborers
then
came
the
sound
of
a
locomotive
bell
and
exhaust
bannon
started
down
the
track
jumping
the
timbers
as
he
ran
toward
vogel
lantern
that
was
bobbing
along
toward
him
the
train
had
stopped
but
now
it
was
puffing
slowly
forward
throwing
a
bright
light
along
the
rails
it
a
local
max
shouted
ca
we
clear
up
the
right
track
bannon
stopped
and
looked
around
about
half
of
the
men
had
followed
him
and
were
strung
out
in
irregular
groups
between
him
and
the
timbers
walking
up
between
the
groups
came
the
delegate
with
two
men
chewing
his
cigar
in
silence
as
he
walked
the
train
was
creeping
along
the
fireman
leaning
far
out
of
the
cab
window
closely
scanning
the
track
for
signs
of
an
obstruction
on
the
steps
between
the
cars
a
few
passengers
were
trying
to
get
a
view
up
the
track
and
others
were
running
along
beside
the
train
this
has
gone
too
far
bannon
muttered
he
turned
and
shouted
to
the
men
clear
up
that
track
quick
now
some
of
the
men
started
but
stopped
and
all
looked
at
the
delegate
he
stepped
to
one
side
and
coolly
looked
over
the
train
then
he
raised
his
hand
do
touch
the
timbers
he
said
it
ai
a
mail
train
his
voice
was
not
loud
but
those
near
at
hand
passed
the
word
along
and
the
long
line
of
men
stood
motionless
by
that
time
the
train
had
stopped
and
three
of
the
crew
had
come
forward
they
saw
the
timbers
on
the
track
and
hurried
toward
them
but
the
delegate
called
out
watch
those
sticks
boys
do
let
a
man
touch
them
there
was
no
hesitation
when
the
delegate
spoke
in
that
tone
a
score
of
men
blocked
the
way
of
the
train
crew
bannon
was
angry
he
stood
looking
at
grady
with
snapping
eyes
and
his
hands
closed
into
knotted
fists
but
bannon
knew
the
power
of
the
unions
and
he
knew
that
a
rash
step
now
might
destroy
all
hope
of
completing
the
elevator
in
time
he
crossed
over
to
the
delegate
what
do
you
want
he
said
gruffly
nothing
from
you
what
do
you
want
bannon
repeated
and
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
caused
the
delegate
to
check
a
second
retort
you
kill
these
men
if
you
work
them
like
this
they
been
on
the
job
all
day
bannon
was
beginning
to
see
that
grady
was
more
eager
to
make
trouble
than
to
uphold
the
cause
of
the
men
he
was
supposed
to
represent
in
his
experience
with
walking
delegates
he
had
not
met
this
type
before
he
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
had
never
had
any
serious
trouble
in
dealing
with
his
workmen
or
their
representatives
macbride
was
fond
of
saying
that
bannon
tact
in
handling
men
was
unequalled
but
bannon
himself
did
not
think
of
it
in
this
way
to
him
trouble
with
the
laborers
or
the
carpenters
or
the
millwrights
meant
loss
of
time
and
loss
of
money
the
two
things
he
was
putting
in
his
time
to
avoid
and
until
now
he
had
found
the
maligned
walking
delegate
a
fair
man
when
he
was
fairly
dealt
with
so
he
said
well
what
are
you
asking
these
gangs
ought
to
be
relieved
every
two
hours
i
do
it
now
clear
up
those
timbers
the
delegate
turned
with
a
scowl
and
waved
the
men
back
to
their
work
in
a
moment
the
track
was
clear
and
the
train
was
moving
slowly
onward
between
the
long
lines
of
men
bannon
started
the
gangs
at
work
when
the
timbers
were
again
coming
across
from
the
wharf
in
six
slowly
moving
streams
that
converged
at
the
end
of
the
elevator
he
stood
looking
after
the
triangle
of
red
lights
on
the
last
car
of
the
train
until
they
had
grown
small
and
close
together
in
the
distance
then
he
went
over
to
the
wharf
to
see
how
much
timber
remained
and
to
tell
peterson
to
hurry
the
work
for
he
did
not
look
for
any
further
accommodation
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
now
that
a
train
had
been
stopped
the
steamer
lay
quietly
at
the
dock
the
long
pile
of
cribbing
on
her
deck
shadowed
by
the
high
bow
deckhouse
from
the
lights
on
the
spouting
house
her
crew
were
bustling
about
rigging
the
two
hoisting
engines
and
making
all
ready
for
unloading
when
the
order
should
be
given
peterson
had
been
working
through
the
timber
pile
from
the
shore
side
so
that
now
only
a
thin
wall
remained
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
wharf
bannon
found
him
standing
on
the
pile
rolling
down
the
sticks
with
a
peavey
to
where
the
carrying
gangs
could
pick
them
up
better
bring
all
your
men
up
here
pete
and
clean
it
all
away
by
the
steamer
she
may
as
well
begin
unloading
now
bannon
walked
back
to
the
tracks
in
time
to
see
a
handcar
and
trailer
packed
with
men
come
up
the
track
and
stop
near
at
hand
the
men
at
once
scattered
and
brushing
aside
bannon
laborers
they
began
replacing
the
sections
of
fence
bannon
crossed
to
the
section
boss
who
recognized
him
and
without
comment
handed
him
a
telegraphed
order
there
no
getting
around
that
he
said
when
bannon
had
read
it
that
straight
from
the
old
man
bannon
returned
it
called
peterson
and
hurried
with
him
around
the
elevator
to
find
max
who
was
overseeing
the
piling
what
we
do
peterson
asked
as
they
ran
but
bannon
made
no
reply
until
the
three
were
together
then
he
said
speaking
shortly
get
the
wire
cable
off
one
of
your
hoisting
engines
pete
and
make
one
end
fast
as
high
as
you
can
on
the
spouting
house
we
run
it
across
the
tracks
on
a
slope
down
to
this
side
max
you
get
a
light
rope
and
a
running
block
and
hang
a
hook
on
it
i
see
said
max
eagerly
you
going
to
run
it
over
on
a
trolley
yes
the
engineers
have
gone
have
they
went
at
five
said
peterson
that
all
right
we
only
need
the
hoist
at
the
spouting
house
the
rest
of
it
just
plain
sliding
down
hill
but
who
run
it
i
will
pete
you
get
up
on
the
spouting
house
and
see
that
started
down
max
will
stay
over
here
and
watch
the
piling
now
rush
it
half
an
hour
had
gone
before
the
cable
could
be
stretched
from
the
spouting
house
high
over
the
tracks
down
to
the
elevator
structure
and
before
the
hoisting
engine
could
be
got
under
steam
meanwhile
for
the
third
time
since
five
the
laborers
stood
about
grumbling
and
growing
more
impatient
but
at
last
it
was
all
under
way
the
timbers
were
hoisted
lightly
up
the
side
of
the
spouting
house
hooked
to
the
travelling
block
and
sent
whirling
down
to
max
waiting
hands
to
be
snatched
away
and
piled
by
the
men
but
compared
with
the
other
method
it
was
slow
work
and
bannon
found
that
for
lack
of
employment
it
was
necessary
to
let
half
of
the
men
go
for
the
night
soon
to
the
rattle
of
blocks
and
the
tramping
of
feet
and
the
calling
and
shouting
of
men
was
added
the
creak
of
the
steamer
hoists
and
the
groan
of
her
donkey
engines
as
her
crew
began
the
work
of
dumping
out
the
cribbing
by
hand
and
steam
on
the
cleared
space
on
the
wharf
and
then
when
the
last
big
stick
had
gone
over
peterson
began
sending
bundles
of
cribbing
before
the
work
was
finished
and
the
last
plank
from
the
steamer
cargo
had
been
tossed
on
the
pile
by
the
annex
the
first
faint
color
was
spreading
over
the
eastern
sky
and
the
damp
of
a
morning
was
in
the
air
bannon
stopped
the
engine
and
drew
the
fire
peterson
and
his
crew
clambered
to
the
ground
and
max
put
on
his
coat
and
waited
for
the
two
foremen
to
come
across
the
tracks
when
they
joined
him
bannon
looked
sharply
at
him
in
the
growing
light
hello
max
he
said
where
did
you
get
that
black
eye
that
ai
much
max
replied
you
ought
to
see
briggs
chapter
vi
when
bannon
came
on
the
job
on
friday
morning
at
seven
a
group
of
men
were
falling
into
line
at
the
timekeeper
window
max
was
in
the
office
passing
out
the
checks
his
sister
was
continuing
her
work
of
the
night
before
going
over
what
books
and
papers
were
to
be
found
in
the
desk
bannon
hung
up
his
overcoat
and
looked
through
the
doorway
at
the
square
mass
of
the
elevator
that
stood
out
against
the
sky
like
some
gigantic
unroofed
barn
the
walls
rose
nearly
eighty
feet
from
the
ground
though
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
structure
made
them
appear
lower
so
close
to
the
tops
of
the
posts
that
were
to
support
the
cupola
frame
that
bannon
eyes
spoke
of
satisfaction
he
meant
to
hide
those
posts
behind
the
rising
walls
of
cribbing
before
the
day
should
be
gone
he
glanced
about
at
the
piles
of
plank
that
hid
the
annex
foundation
work
there
it
lay
two
hundred
thousand
feet
of
it
not
very
much
to
be
sure
but
enough
to
keep
the
men
busy
for
the
present
and
enough
too
to
give
a
start
to
the
annex
bins
and
walls
peterson
was
approaching
from
the
tool
house
and
bannon
called
how
many
laborers
have
you
got
pete
hardly
any
max
there
can
tell
max
who
had
just
passed
out
his
last
check
now
joined
them
at
the
doorstep
there
just
that
came
for
checks
he
said
not
counting
the
carpenters
about
what
i
expected
bannon
replied
this
night
business
lays
them
out
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
you
better
give
checks
to
any
new
men
that
we
send
to
the
window
miss
vogel
but
keep
the
names
of
the
old
men
and
if
they
show
up
in
the
morning
take
them
back
on
the
job
now
boys
to
peterson
and
max
pick
up
the
men
you
see
hanging
around
and
send
them
over
i
be
at
the
office
for
a
while
we
push
the
cribbing
on
the
main
house
and
start
right
in
on
the
annex
bins
there
ai
much
time
to
throw
around
if
we
going
to
eat
our
christmas
dinner
the
two
went
at
once
the
hoisting
engines
were
impatiently
blowing
off
steam
new
men
were
appearing
every
moment
delaying
only
to
answer
a
few
brisk
questions
and
to
give
their
names
to
miss
vogel
and
then
hurrying
away
to
the
tool
house
each
with
his
brass
check
fastened
to
his
coat
when
bannon
was
at
last
ready
to
enter
the
office
he
paused
again
to
look
over
the
ground
the
engines
were
now
puffing
steadily
and
the
rapping
of
many
hammers
came
through
the
crisp
air
gangs
of
laborers
were
swarming
over
the
lumber
piles
pitching
down
the
planks
and
other
gangs
were
carrying
them
away
and
piling
them
on
dollies
to
be
pushed
along
the
plank
runways
to
the
hoist
there
was
a
black
fringe
of
heads
between
the
posts
on
the
top
of
the
elevator
where
the
carpenters
were
spiking
down
the
last
planks
of
the
walls
and
bins
miss
vogel
was
at
work
on
the
ledger
when
bannon
entered
the
office
he
pushed
his
hat
back
on
his
head
and
came
up
beside
her
how
it
coming
out
he
asked
do
we
know
how
much
we
good
for
she
looked
up
smiling
i
think
so
i
nearly
through
it
a
little
mixed
in
some
places
but
i
think
everything
has
been
entered
can
you
drop
it
long
enough
to
take
a
letter
or
so
oh
yes
she
reached
for
her
notebook
saying
with
a
nod
toward
the
table
the
mail
is
here
bannon
went
rapidly
through
the
heap
of
letters
and
bills
there
nothing
much
he
said
you
need
wait
for
me
to
open
it
after
this
you
want
to
read
everything
to
keep
posted
these
bills
for
cribbing
go
to
your
brother
you
know
there
was
one
chair
within
the
enclosure
he
brought
it
forward
and
sat
down
tipping
back
against
the
railing
well
i
guess
we
may
as
well
go
ahead
and
tell
the
firm
that
we

around

drawing
our
salaries

macbride

up
and
moved

chair
to
the
table

bannon
he
had
folded
the
letter
and
addressed
the
envelope
when
he
paused
and
looked
around
the
typewritten
letter
to
macbride
company
lay
at
his
elbow
he
signed
it
before
he
spoke
miss
vogel

or
papers
about
an
agreement

the
s
no
she
replied
there
is
nothing
here
about
the
railroad
bannon
drummed
on
the
table
then
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
to
a
laborer
who
was
leaving
the
tool
house
find
peterson
and
ask
him
if
he
will
please
come
to
the
office
for
a
moment
he
came
slowly
back
and
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
table
watching
miss
vogel
as
her
pencil
moved
rapidly
up
column
after
column
had
quite
a
time
up
there
in
michigan
he
said
those
people
were
after
us
in
earnest
if
they
had
their
way
we
never
have
got
the
cribbing
she
looked
up
you
see
they
had
told
sloan
he
the
man
that
owns
the
lumber
company
and
the
city
of
ledyard
and
pretty
much
all
of
the
lower
peninsula
that
they
had
any
cars
and
he
just
swallowed
it
down
and
folded
up
his
napkin
i
had
got
to
ledyard
before
i
saw
a
string
of
empties
on
a
siding
that
were
doing
a
thing
but
waiting
for
our
cribbing
so
i
caught
a
train
to
blake
city
and
gave
the
division
superintendent
some
points
on
running
railroads
he
was
a
nice
friendly
man
bannon
clasped
his
hands
about
one
knee
and
smiled
reminiscently
i
had
him
pretty
busy
there
for
a
while
thinking
up
lies
he
was
wondering
how
he
could
get
ready
for
the
next
caller
when
i
came
at
him
and
made
him
wire
the
general
manager
of
the
line
the
operator
was
sitting
right
outside
the
door
and
when
the
answer
came
i
just
took
it
in
it
gave
the
whole
snap
away
clear
as
you
want
miss
vogel
turned
on
her
stool
you
took
his
message
i
should
say
i
did
it
takes
a
pretty
lively
man
to
crowd
me
off
the
end
of
a
wire
he
told
the
superintendent
not
to
give
us
cars
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
know
so
i
told
him
how
sorry
i
was
that
i
could
stay
to
lunch
caught
the
next
train
back
to
ledyard
and
built
a
fire
under
sloan
miss
vogel
was
looking
out
of
the
window
he
said
he
could
not
give
us
cars
she
repeated
bannon
smiled
but
we
did
need
them
he
said
i
got
a
barge
to
come
over
from
milwaukee
and
we
loaded
her
up
and
started
her
down
i
do
understand
bannon
ledyard
is
on
the
lake
and
you
could
get
cars
that
was
very
hard
he
paused
for
a
step
sounded
outside
the
door
and
in
a
moment
peterson
had
come
in
i
guess
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
did
you
charlie
yes
i
writing
to
the
office
it
about
this
business
you
said
you
had
trouble
with
them
before
oh
no
said
peterson
sitting
on
the
railing
and
removing
his
hat
with
a
side
glance
at
miss
vogel
not
to
speak
of
there
was
nothing
so
bad
as
last
night
what
was
it
why
just
a
little
talk
when
we
opened
the
fence
first
time
that
section
boss
was
around
but
i
told
him
how
things
was
and
he
seem
to
have
no
kick
coming
as
long
as
we
was
careful
bannon
had
taken
up
his
letter
to
brown
and
was
slowly
unfolding
it
and
looking
it
over
when
peterson
got
to
his
feet
he
laid
it
on
the
table
anything
else
charlie
i
just
getting
things
to
going
on
the
annex
we
going
to
make
her
jump
i
tell
you
i
ai
allowing
any
loafing
there
no
bannon
replied
i
guess
not
he
followed
the
foreman
out
of
doors
do
you
remember
having
any
letters
pete
about
our
agreement
with
the
to
build
over
the
tracks
from
the
office
or
anybody
peterson
brought
his
brows
together
and
tried
to
remember
after
a
moment
he
slowly
shook
his
head
nothing
eh
said
bannon
not
that
i
can
think
of
something
may
have
come
in
while
max
was
here
in
the
office
i
wish
you
ask
him
all
right
he
be
around
my
way
before
long
taking
the
time
and
say
bannon
added
with
one
foot
on
the
doorstep
you
seen
anything
more
of
that
man
briggs
have
you
peterson
shook
his
head
if
you
see
him
hanging
around
you
may
as
well
throw
him
right
off
the
job
peterson
grinned
i
guess
he
wo
show
up
very
fast
max
did
him
up
good
last
night
when
he
was
blowing
off
about
bringing
the
delegate
around
bannon
had
drawn
the
door
to
after
him
when
he
came
out
he
was
turning
back
with
a
hand
on
the
knob
when
peterson
who
was
lingering
said
in
a
low
voice
getting
out
the
words
awkwardly
say
charlie
she
all
right
ai
she
bannon
did
not
reply
and
peterson
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
office
max
sister
there
i
never
saw
any
red
hair
before
that
was
up
to
the
mark
ai
she
a
little
uppish
though
do
you
think
i
guess
not
girls
generally
is
they
got
tempers
too
most
of
them
it
funny
about
her
looks
she
do
look
any
more
like
max
than
anything
he
grinned
again
lord
max
is
a
peach
though
ai
he
bannon
nodded
and
reëntered
the
office
he
sat
down
and
added
a
postscript
to
his
letter
the
people
are
trying
to
make
it
warm
for
us
about
working
across
their
tracks
ca
we
have
an
understanding
with
them
before
we
get
ready
to
put
up
the
belt
gallery
if
we
do
we
have
to
build
a
suspension
bridge
b
he
sealed
the
envelope
and
tossed
it
to
one
side
miss
vogel
he
said
pushing
his
chair
back
did
you
ask
me
something
just
now
it
was
about
getting
the
cribbing
across
the
lake
she
replied
i
do
see
how
you
did
it
her
interest
in
the
work
pleased
bannon
it
ai
a
bad
story
you
see
the
farmers
up
in
that
country
hate
the
railroads
it
the
tariff
rebate
you
know
they
have
to
pay
more
to
ship
their
stuff
to
market
than
some
places
a
thousand
miles
farther
off
and
i
guess
the
service
is
pretty
bad
all
around
i
was
figuring
on
something
like
that
as
soon
as
i
had
a
look
at
things
so
we
got
up
a
poster
and
had
it
printed
telling
what
they
all
think
of
the
he
paused
and
his
eyes
twinkled
i
would
mind
handing
one
to
that
superintendent
just
for
the
fun
of
seeing
him
when
he
read
it
it
told
the
farmers
to
come
around
to
sloan
lumber
yard
with
their
wagons
and
you
carried
it
across
in
the
wagons
i
guess
we
did
is
it
a
good
ways
eighteen
to
thirty
miles
according
to
who
you
ask
as
soon
as
things
got
to
going
we
went
after
the
general
manager
and
gave
him
a
bad
half
hour
so
i
should
be
surprised
to
see
the
rest
of
the
bill
coming
in
by
rail
any
time
now
bannon
got
up
and
slowly
buttoned
his
coat
he
was
looking
about
the
office
at
the
floor
and
the
coated
windows
and
at
the
hanging
shreds
of
spider
web
in
the
corners
and
between
the
rafters
overhead
it
ai
a
very
cheerful
house
to
live
in
all
day
is
it
he
said
i
do
know
but
what
we
better
clean
house
a
little
there
not
much
danger
of
putting
a
shine
on
things
that
hurt
your
eyes
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
some
one
that
could
come
in
once
in
a
while
and
stir
up
the
dust
do
you
know
of
any
one
there
is
a
woman
that
comes
to
our
i
think
they
know
about
her
at
the
hotel
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
hotel
she
be
here
this
afternoon
he
said
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
will
she
bring
her
own
scrubbing
things
or
are
we
supposed
to
have
them
for
her
this
is
some
out
of
my
line
miss
vogel
was
smiling
she
have
her
own
things
i
guess
when
she
comes
would
you
like
me
to
start
her
to
work
if
you
just
as
soon
and
tell
her
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
i
got
to
go
out
now
but
i
be
around
off
and
on
during
the
day
when
the
noon
whistle
blew
bannon
and
max
were
standing
near
the
annex
already
the
bins
and
walls
had
been
raised
more
than
a
foot
above
the
foundation
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
great
looks
like
business
does
it
said
max
he
was
a
little
excited
for
now
there
was
to
be
no
more
delaying
until
the
elevator
should
stand
completed
from
the
working
floor
to
the
top
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
until
engines
conveyors
and
scales
should
be
working
smoothly
and
every
bin
filled
with
grain
indeed
nearly
everybody
on
the
job
had
by
this
time
caught
the
spirit
of
energy
that
bannon
had
infused
into
the
work
i
be
glad
when
it
gets
up
far
enough
to
look
like
something
so
we
can
feel
that
things
are
really
getting
on
they
getting
on
all
right
bannon
replied
how
soon
will
we
be
working
on
the
cupola
max
stopped
they
had
started
toward
the
office
and
looked
at
bannon
in
amazement
why
we
ca
do
it
can
we
why
not
bannon
pointed
toward
a
cleared
space
behind
the
pile
of
cribbing
where
the
carpenters
had
been
at
work
on
the
heavy
timbers
they
all
ready
for
the
framing
max
made
no
reply
but
he
looked
up
as
they
passed
the
elevator
and
measured
with
his
eyes
the
space
remaining
between
the
cribbing
and
the
tops
of
the
posts
he
had
yet
to
become
accustomed
to
bannon
methods
but
he
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
believe
that
it
would
be
done
if
bannon
said
so
they
were
halfway
to
the
office
when
max
said
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
how
hilda
going
to
take
hold
mr
bannon
max
eyes
sparkled
she
can
do
anything
you
give
her
her
head
as
clear
as
a
bell
for
the
moment
bannon
made
no
reply
but
as
they
paused
outside
the
office
door
he
said
we
better
make
a
point
of
dropping
in
at
the
office
now
and
then
during
the
day
any
time
you
know
i
out
on
the
job
and
you
up
this
way
just
look
in
max
nodded
and
nights
when
we
working
overtime
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
your
getting
off
long
enough
to
see
your
sister
home
she
need
to
do
any
night
work
they
entered
the
office
miss
vogel
was
standing
by
the
railing
gate
buttoning
her
jacket
and
waiting
for
max
behind
her
bending
over
the
blue
prints
on
the
table
stood
peterson
apparently
too
absorbed
to
hear
the
two
men
come
in
bannon
gave
him
a
curious
glance
for
no
blue
prints
were
needed
in
working
on
the
annex
which
was
simply
a
matter
of
building
bins
up
from
the
foundation
when
max
and
his
sister
had
gone
the
foreman
looked
around
and
said
with
a
show
of
surprise
oh
hello
charlie
going
up
to
the
house
yes
peterson
manner
was
not
wholly
natural
as
they
walked
across
the
flats
his
conversation
was
a
little
forced
and
he
laughed
occasionally
at
certain
occurrences
in
the
morning
work
that
were
not
particularly
amusing
bannon
did
not
get
back
to
the
office
until
a
half
hour
after
work
had
commenced
for
the
afternoon
he
carried
a
large
bundle
under
one
arm
and
in
his
hand
a
wooden
box
with
a
slot
cut
in
the
cover
he
found
the
hard
at
work
on
the
office
floor
the
chair
and
the
unused
stool
were
on
the
table
he
looked
about
with
satisfaction
it
begins
to
look
better
already
he
said
to
miss
vogel
you
know
we
not
going
to
be
able
to
keep
it
all
clean
there
be
too
many
coming
in
but
there
going
to
be
a
law
passed
about
tracking
mud
inside
the
railing
he
opened
his
bundle
and
unrolled
a
door
mat
which
he
laid
in
front
of
the
gate
miss
vogel
was
smiling
but
bannon
face
was
serious
he
cut
a
square
piece
from
the
wrapping
paper
and
sitting
on
the
table
printed
the
placard
wipe
your
feet
or
put
five
cents
in
the
box
then
he
nailed
both
box
and
placard
to
the
railing
and
stood
back
to
look
at
his
work
that
will
do
it
he
said
she
nodded
there
no
danger
that
they
wo
see
it
we
had
a
box
down
on
the
new
orleans
job
said
bannon
only
that
was
for
swearing
every
time
anybody
swore
he
put
in
a
nickel
and
then
when
saturday
came
around
we
have
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
to
spend
it
did
stop
the
swearing
then
oh
yes
everybody
was
broke
a
day
or
so
after
pay
day
and
for
a
few
days
every
week
it
was
the
best
crowd
you
ever
saw
but
we
wo
spend
this
money
that
way
i
guess
we
let
you
decide
what
to
do
with
it
hour
by
hour
the
piles
of
cribbing
dwindled
and
on
the
elevator
the
distance
from
bin
walls
to
grew
shorter
before
five
the
last
planks
were
spiked
home
on
the
walls
and
bins
in
the
northwest
corner
a
few
hours
work
in
the
morning
would
bring
the
rest
of
the
house
to
the
same
level
and
then
work
could
commence
on
the
distributing
floor
and
on
the
frame
of
the
cupola
before
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
had
started
two
teams
of
horses
dragging
the
cupola
timbers
which
had
been
cut
ready
for
framing
to
the
foot
of
the
hoist
by
ten
in
the
morning
bannon
figured
the
engine
would
be
lifting
timbers
instead
of
bundles
of
cribbing
there
was
a
chill
wind
up
there
on
the
top
of
the
elevator
coming
across
the
flats
out
of
the
glowing
sunset
but
bannon
let
his
coat
flap
open
as
he
gave
a
hand
now
and
then
to
help
the
men
he
liked
to
feel
the
wind
tugging
at
sleeves
and
cap
and
he
leaned
against
it
and
too
he
would
have
been
had
not
a
carpenter
rods
away
on
the
cribbing
put
out
a
hand
to
catch
his
cap
as
it
tried
to
whirl
past
on
a
gust
the
river
wound
away
toward
the
lake
touched
with
the
color
of
the
sky
to
lose
itself
half
a
mile
away
among
the
straggling
rows
of
factories
and
rolling
mills
from
the
splendid
crimson
of
the
western
sky
to
the
broken
horizon
line
of
south
chicago
whose
buildings
hid
lake
michigan
the
air
was
crisp
and
clear
but
on
the
north
over
the
dim
shops
and
blocks
of
houses
that
grew
closer
together
as
the
eye
went
on
until
spires
and
towers
and
gray
walls
were
massed
in
confusion
hung
a
veil
of
smoke
like
a
black
cloud
spreading
away
farther
than
eye
could
see
this
was
chicago
bannon
climbed
to
the
ground
and
took
a
last
look
about
the
work
before
going
to
the
office
the
annex
was
growing
slowly
but
surely
and
peterson
coatless
and
hatless
as
usual
with
sleeves
rolled
up
was
at
work
with
the
men
swinging
a
hammer
here
impatiently
shouldering
a
bundle
of
planks
there
and
bannon
saw
more
clearly
what
he
had
known
before
that
peterson
was
a
good
man
when
kept
within
his
limitations
certainly
the
annex
could
not
have
been
better
started
when
bannon
entered
the
office
miss
vogel
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
he
came
in
through
the
gate
and
stood
at
the
desk
beside
her
to
have
the
light
of
the
lamp
it
was
a
balance
sheet
giving
the
results
of
her
examination
of
the
books
all
right
eh
he
said
a
glance
had
been
enough
to
show
him
that
hereafter
there
would
be
no
confusion
in
the
books
the
cashier
of
a
metropolitan
bank
could
not
have
issued
a
more
businesslike
statement
he
tossed
it
on
the
desk
saying
you
might
file
it
then
he
took
time
to
look
about
the
office
it
was
as
clean
as
blackened
splintered
planks
could
be
made
even
the
ceiling
had
been
attacked
and
every
trace
of
cobweb
removed
well
he
said
this
is
business
and
we
keep
it
this
way
too
she
had
faced
about
on
the
stool
and
was
looking
at
him
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
yes
she
said
evidently
trying
not
to
laugh
we
try
to
he
was
not
looking
at
her
as
she
spoke
but
when
a
moment
later
the
laugh
broke
away
from
her
he
turned
she
was
looking
at
his
feet
he
glanced
down
and
saw
a
row
of
black
footprints
leading
from
the
door
to
where
he
stood
one
of
them
squarely
in
the
centre
of
the
new
mat
he
gazed
ruefully
then
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
quarter
dropping
it
in
the
box
well
he
said
wiping
his
feet
but
the
whistle
just
then
gave
a
long
blast
and
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
after
supper
bannon
and
peterson
sat
in
the
room
they
occupied
together
in
the
walk
home
and
during
supper
there
had
been
the
same
sullen
manner
about
the
younger
man
that
bannon
had
observed
at
noon
half
a
day
was
a
long
time
for
peterson
to
keep
to
himself
something
that
bothered
him
and
before
the
close
of
dinner
he
had
begun
working
the
talk
around
now
after
a
long
silence
that
bannon
filled
with
sharpening
pencils
he
said
some
people
think
a
lot
of
themselves
do
they
charlie
bannon
looked
up
from
his
pencils
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
seems
to
think
she
max
and
you
and
me
and
everybody
i
thought
she
looked
pretty
civil
and
i
did
say
a
word
she
need
to
have
got
about
bannon
asked
no
questions
after
waiting
to
give
him
an
opportunity
peterson
went
on
there
going
to
be
a
picnic
sunday
of
the
iron
workers
up
at
sharpshooters
park
i
know
a
fellow
that
has
tickets
it
be
just
as
quiet
as
anywhere
and
speeches
you
know
i
do
see
that
she
any
better
than
a
lot
of
the
girls
that
be
there
do
you
mean
to
say
you
asked
her
to
go
bannon
asked
yes
and
she
bannon
had
turned
away
to
strop
his
razor
on
his
hand
and
peterson
after
one
or
two
attempts
to
begin
the
story
let
the
subject
drop
chapter
vii
bannon
had
the
knack
of
commanding
men
he
knew
the
difference
between
an
isolated
or
better
perhaps
an
insulated
man
and
the
same
man
in
a
crowd
without
knowing
how
he
did
it
he
could
nevertheless
distinguish
between
the
signs
of
temporary
ill
feeling
among
the
men
and
the
perhaps
less
apparent
danger
signal
that
meant
serious
mischief
since
his
first
day
on
the
job
the
attitude
of
the
men
had
worried
him
a
little
there
was
something
in
the
air
he
did
not
like
peterson
accustomed
to
handling
smaller
bodies
of
men
had
made
the
natural
mistake
of
driving
the
very
large
force
employed
on
the
elevator
with
much
too
loose
a
rein
the
men
were
still
further
demoralized
by
the
episode
with
the
walking
delegate
grady
on
thursday
night
bannon
knew
too
much
to
attempt
halfway
measures
so
he
waited
for
a
case
of
insubordination
serious
enough
to
call
for
severe
treatment
when
he
happened
into
the
office
about
the
middle
of
saturday
morning
miss
vogel
handed
him
two
letters
addressed
to
him
personally
one
was
from
brown
the
last
paragraph
of
it
as
follows
young
page
has
told
macbride
in
so
many
words
what
we
all
been
guessing
about
that
is
that
they
are
fighting
to
break
the
corner
in
december
wheat
they
have
a
tremendous
short
line
on
the
chicago
board
and
they
mean
to
deliver
it
hundred
thousand
has
got
to
be
in
the
bins
there
at
calumet
before
the
first
of
january
unless
the
day
of
judgment
happens
along
before
then
never
mind
what
it
costs
you
brown
macbride
has
got
down
an
atlas
and
is
trying
to
figure
out
how
you
got
that
cribbing
to
the
lake
i
told
him
you
put
the
barge
on
rollers
and
towed
it
up
to
ledyard
with
a
traction
engine
the
letter
from
sloan
was
to
the
effect
that
twelve
cars
were
at
that
moment
on
the
yard
siding
loading
with
cribbing
and
that
all
of
it
something
more
than
eighteen
hundred
thousand
feet
would
probably
be
in
chicago
within
a
week
a
note
was
scribbled
on
the
margin
in
handwriting
those
fool
farmers
are
still
coming
in
expecting
a
job
one
is
out
in
the
yard
now
came
clear
from
victory
i
had
to
send
out
a
man
to
take
down
the
posters
that
just
like
a
farmer
bannon
said
to
miss
vogel
time
count
with
him
morning
or
two
weeks
from
next
tuesday
he
ca
see
the
difference
i
suppose
if
one
of
those
posters
on
an
inconspicuous
tree
happens
to
be
overlooked
that
some
old
fellow
come
driving
in
next
fourth
of
july
he
buttoned
his
coat
as
though
going
out
but
stood
looking
at
her
thoughtfully
awhile
all
the
same
he
said
i
like
to
be
that
way
myself
never
do
anything
till
i
going
to
turn
farmer
some
day
once
i
get
this
job
done
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
can
hurry
me
i
say
to
macbride
willing
to
work
on
nice
quiet
easy
little
jobs
that
never
have
to
be
finished
i
want
to
sit
at
the
desk
and
whittle
most
of
the
time
but
if
you
ever
try
to
put
me
on
a
rush
job
i
quit
and
buy
a
small
farm
i
could
make
the
laziest
farmer
in
twelve
states
well
i
got
to
go
out
on
the
job
an
elevator
is
simply
a
big
grain
warehouse
and
of
course
the
bins
where
the
grain
is
kept
occupy
most
of
the
building
but
for
handling
the
grain
more
than
bin
room
is
necessary
beneath
the
bins
is
what
is
called
the
working
story
where
is
the
machinery
for
unloading
cars
and
for
lifting
the
grain
the
cupola
which
bannon
was
about
to
frame
is
a
building
perched
atop
the
bins
it
contains
the
appliances
for
weighing
the
grain
and
distributing
it
when
bannon
climbed
out
on
top
of
the
bins
he
found
the
carpenters
partially
flooring
over
the
area
preparatory
to
putting
in
place
the
framework
of
the
cupola
below
them
in
the
bins
like
bees
in
a
honeycomb
laborers
were
taking
down
the
scaffolding
which
had
served
in
building
their
walls
at
the
south
side
of
the
building
a
group
of
laborers
under
one
of
the
foremen
was
rigging
what
is
known
as
a
boom
hoist
which
was
to
lift
the
timbers
for
framing
the
cupola
while
bannon
stood
watching
the
carpenters
one
of
them
sawed
off
the
end
of
a
plank
and
dropped
it
down
into
the
bin
there
was
a
low
laugh
and
one
or
two
of
the
men
glanced
uneasily
at
bannon
he
spoke
to
the
offender
do
do
that
again
if
you
want
to
stay
on
this
job
you
know
there
are
men
at
work
down
there
then
look
here
he
called
getting
the
attention
of
all
the
carpenters
every
man
that
drops
anything
into
the
bins
gets
docked
an
hour
pay
if
he
does
it
twice
he
leaves
the
job
just
as
quick
as
we
can
make
out
a
i
want
you
to
be
careful
he
was
picking
his
way
over
to
the
group
of
men
about
the
hoisting
pole
when
he
heard
another
general
laugh
from
the
carpenters
turning
back
he
saw
them
all
looking
at
a
fellow
named
reilly
who
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
was
peering
with
mock
concern
down
into
the
dark
bin
my
hammer
slipped
bannon
heard
him
say
in
a
loud
aside
to
the
man
nearest
him
then
with
a
laugh
accidents
will
happen
bannon
almost
smiled
himself
for
the
man
had
played
right
into
his
hand
he
had
in
the
four
days
since
he
took
command
already
become
aware
of
reilly
and
had
put
him
down
for
the
sort
ambitious
to
rise
rather
in
the
organization
of
his
union
than
in
his
trade
i
guess
we
wo
take
the
trouble
to
dock
you
he
said
go
to
the
office
and
get
your
time
and
be
quick
about
it
too
did
ye
mean
me
the
man
asked
impudently
but
bannon
without
heeding
went
over
to
the
hoist
presently
a
rough
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
say
demanded
reilly
again
did
ye
mean
me
no
doubt
of
that
go
and
get
your
time
i
guess
not
said
the
man
not
me
my
hammer
just
slipped
how
you
going
to
prove
i
meant
to
do
it
i
not
i
going
to
fire
you
you
ai
laid
off
you
understand
you
fired
if
you
ever
come
back
i
have
you
kicked
off
the
place
you
do
dare
fire
me
the
man
said
coming
nearer
you
have
to
take
me
back
i
through
talking
with
you
said
bannon
still
quietly
the
faster
you
can
light
out
of
here
the
better
we
see
about
that
you
ca
come
it
on
the
union
that
way
then
without
any
preparatory
gesture
whatever
bannon
knocked
him
down
the
man
seemed
to
fairly
rebound
from
the
floor
he
rushed
at
the
boss
but
before
he
could
come
within
striking
distance
bannon
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
dropped
it
level
with
reilly
face
i
talked
to
you
he
said
slowly
his
eye
blazing
along
the
barrel
and
i
knocked
you
down
but
the
man
staggered
back
then
walked
away
very
pale
but
muttering
bannon
shoved
back
the
revolver
into
his
hip
pocket
it
all
right
boys
he
said
nothing
to
get
excited
about
he
walked
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
we
ca
wait
to
pick
it
up
a
stick
at
a
time
he
said
i
tell
to
load
four
or
five
on
each
larry
then
you
can
lift
the
whole
bunch
we
run
some
chances
of
a
spill
or
a
break
that
way
said
the
foreman
i
know
it
answered
bannon
dryly
that
the
kind
of
chances
have
to
run
for
the
next
two
months
descending
to
the
ground
he
gave
the
same
order
to
the
men
below
then
he
sent
word
to
peterson
and
vogel
that
he
wished
to
see
them
in
the
office
he
wiped
his
feet
on
the
mat
glancing
at
hilda
as
he
did
so
but
she
was
hard
at
work
and
did
not
look
up
he
took
the
one
unoccupied
chair
and
placed
it
where
he
could
watch
the
burnished
light
in
her
red
hair
presently
she
turned
toward
him
did
you
want
something
she
asked
excuse
me
i
guess
i
in
the
midst
of
his
embarrassment
max
and
pete
came
in
i
got
a
couple
of
letters
i
want
to
talk
over
with
you
boys
he
said
why
i
sent
for
you
pete
laughed
and
vaulted
to
a
seat
on
the
i
was
most
afraid
to
come
he
said
i
heard
you
drawed
a
gun
on
that
fellow
reilly
what
was
he
doing
to
make
you
mad
nothing
much
well
i
glad
you
fired
him
he
made
trouble
right
along
how
it
happen
you
had
a
gun
with
you
do
you
always
carry
one
have
been
without
one
on
a
job
since
i
worked
for
the
old
man
well
said
pete
straightening
up
i
never
so
much
as
owned
one
and
i
never
want
to
i
do
like
if
my
fists
ai
good
enough
to
take
care
of
me
against
any
fellow
that
comes
along
why
he
welcome
to
lick
me
that
all
hilda
glanced
at
him
and
for
a
moment
her
eyes
rested
on
his
figure
there
was
not
a
line
of
it
but
showed
grace
and
strength
and
a
magnificent
confidence
then
as
if
for
the
contrast
she
looked
at
bannon
he
had
been
watching
her
all
the
while
and
he
seemed
to
guess
her
thought
that
all
right
he
said
in
answer
to
peterson
when
it
just
you
and
him
and
a
fellow
to
hold
your
coats
but
it
do
always
begin
that
way
i
been
in
places
where
things
got
pretty
miscellaneous
sometimes
but
i
never
had
a
man
come
up
and
say
bannon
i
going
to
lick
you
any
time
when
you
ready
there
generally
from
three
to
thirty
and
they
all
try
to
get
on
your
back
peterson
laughed
reminiscently
i
was
an
attendant
in
the
insane
ward
of
the
massachusetts
general
hospital
for
a
while
and
one
time
when
i
was
looking
for
it
of
those
lunatics
all
jumped
on
me
at
once
they
got
me
on
the
floor
and
killed
me
he
paused
as
though
there
was
nothing
more
to
tell
do
stop
there
said
max
why
he
went
on
i
crawled
along
the
floor
till
i
got
to
a
chair
and
i
just
knocked
around
with
that
till
they
was
quiet
bannon
looked
at
his
watch
then
he
took
brown
letter
from
his
pocket
it
from
the
office
he
said
we
got
to
have
the
bins
full
before
new
year
day
got
to
exclaimed
pete
i
do
see
it
that
way
we
ca
do
it
can
or
ca
that
do
interest
macbride
a
bit
he
says
it
got
to
be
done
and
it
has
why
he
ca
expect
us
to
do
it
he
did
say
anything
about
january
first
to
me
did
know
it
was
a
rush
job
and
then
we
played
in
hard
luck
too
before
you
came
that
cribbing
being
tied
up
for
instance
he
certainly
ca
blame
us
if
that
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
bannon
cut
in
shortly
he
do
pay
us
to
make
excuses
he
pays
us
to
do
as
we
told
when
i
have
to
begin
explaining
to
macbride
why
it
ca
be
done
i
send
my
resignation
along
in
a
separate
envelope
and
go
to
peddling
a
cure
for
corns
what
we
want
to
talk
about
is
how
we
going
to
do
it
peterson
flushed
but
said
nothing
and
bannon
went
on
now
what
we
got
to
do
we
got
to
frame
the
cupola
and
put
on
the
roof
and
sheathe
the
entire
house
with
galvanized
iron
we
got
to
finish
the
spouting
house
and
sheathe
that
we
got
to
build
the
belt
gallery
and
we
have
no
end
of
a
time
doing
it
if
the
is
still
looking
for
trouble
then
there
all
the
machinery
to
erect
and
the
millwright
work
to
do
and
we
got
to
build
the
annex
i
thought
you
was
going
to
forget
that
said
pete
that
the
worst
job
of
all
no
it
ai
it
the
easiest
it
build
itself
it
just
a
case
of
two
and
two
makes
four
all
you
got
to
do
is
spike
down
planks
till
it
done
and
then
clap
on
some
sort
of
a
roof
there
no
machinery
no
details
just
straight
work
it
just
a
question
of
having
the
lumber
to
do
it
with
and
we
got
it
now
it
the
little
work
that
can
raise
ned
with
you
there
is
more
than
a
million
little
things
that
any
man
ought
to
do
in
half
an
hour
but
if
one
of
goes
wrong
it
may
hold
you
up
for
all
day
now
i
figure
the
business
this
way
he
took
a
memorandum
from
his
pocket
and
began
reading
there
was
very
little
guesswork
about
it
he
had
set
down
as
nearly
as
possible
the
amount
of
labor
involved
in
each
separate
piece
of
construction
and
the
number
of
men
who
could
work
on
it
at
once
allowing
for
the
different
kinds
of
work
that
could
be
done
simultaneously
he
made
out
a
total
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
well
that
all
right
i
guess
said
pete
but
you
see
that
takes
us
way
along
into
next
year
sometime
about
march
first
said
max
you
have
divided
by
three
yet
said
bannon
we
get
three
days
into
every
hours
and
of
into
every
week
why
that
better
than
we
need
to
do
said
pete
after
a
moment
that
gets
us
about
two
weeks
ahead
of
time
did
you
ever
get
through
when
you
thought
you
would
bannon
demanded
i
never
did
do
you
know
that
you
always
get
hit
by
something
you
ai
looking
for
i
figuring
in
our
margin
that
all
there
are
some
things
i
looking
for
too
we
have
a
strike
here
before
we
get
through
oh
i
guess
not
said
pete
easily
you
still
thinking
of
reilly
are
you
and
for
another
thing
page
company
are
likely
to
spring
something
on
us
at
the
last
moment
what
sort
of
thing
if
i
knew
i
go
ahead
and
build
it
now
but
i
do
how
are
you
going
to
work
three
gangs
who
look
after
one
of
us
has
got
to
stay
up
nights
i
guess
said
bannon
we
have
to
get
a
couple
of
boys
to
help
max
keep
time
it
may
take
us
a
day
or
two
to
get
the
good
men
divided
up
and
the
thing
to
running
properly
but
we
ought
to
be
going
full
blast
by
the
first
of
the
week
he
arose
and
buttoned
his
coat
you
two
know
the
men
better
than
i
do
i
wish
you
go
through
the
pay
roll
and
pick
out
the
best
men
and
find
out
if
you
can
who
work
nights
at
regular
night
wages
peterson
came
out
of
the
office
with
him
i
suppose
you
put
me
in
the
night
gang
he
said
i
have
decided
yet
what
i
do
when
i
came
by
the
main
hoist
pete
went
on
they
was
picking
up
four
and
five
sticks
at
once
i
stopped
and
they
said
it
was
your
orders
you
come
to
smash
that
way
sure
as
a
gun
not
if
they
do
take
more
than
i
told
to
and
if
they
careful
they
have
to
do
it
to
keep
up
with
the
carpenters
well
it
running
a
big
risk
that
all
i
do
like
it
my
god
do
i
know
it
a
risk
do
you
suppose
i
like
it
we
got
something
to
do
and
we
got
to
do
it
somehow
pete
laughed
uneasily
i
i
told
not
to
pick
up
more
than
two
sticks
at
a
time
till
they
heard
from
me
i
think
said
bannon
with
a
look
that
was
new
to
pete
i
think
better
go
as
fast
as
you
can
and
tell
them
to
go
on
as
they
were
when
you
found
them
late
on
tuesday
afternoon
the
hoist
broke
it
was
not
easy
to
get
from
the
men
a
clear
account
of
the
accident
the
boss
of
the
gang
denied
that
he
had
carried
more
of
a
load
than
bannon
had
authorized
but
some
of
the
talk
among
the
men
indicated
the
contrary
only
one
man
was
injured
and
he
not
fatally
a
piece
of
almost
miraculous
good
luck
some
scaffolding
was
torn
down
and
a
couple
of
timbers
badly
sprung
but
the
total
damage
was
really
slight
bannon
in
person
superintended
rigging
the
new
hoist
it
was
ready
for
work
within
two
hours
after
the
accident
she
guyed
a
little
better
than
the
other
was
i
think
said
bannon
to
the
foreman
you
have
any
more
trouble
go
ahead
how
about
the
load
carry
the
same
load
as
before
you
were
any
more
than
keeping
up
chapter
viii
five
minutes
after
the
noon
whistle
blew
on
saturday
every
carpenter
and
laborer
knew
that
bannon
had
pulled
a
gun
on
reilly
those
who
heard
it
last
heard
more
than
that
for
when
the
story
had
passed
through
a
few
hands
it
was
bigger
and
it
took
longer
to
tell
and
every
man
during
the
afternoon
kept
his
eyes
more
closely
on
his
work
some
were
angry
but
these
dropped
from
muttering
into
sullenness
the
majority
were
relieved
for
a
good
workman
is
surer
of
himself
under
a
firm
than
under
a
slack
hand
but
all
were
cowed
and
bannon
when
after
dinner
he
looked
over
the
work
knew
more
about
all
of
them
and
their
feelings
perhaps
than
they
knew
themselves
he
knew
too
that
the
incident
might
in
the
long
run
make
trouble
but
trouble
was
likely
in
any
case
and
it
was
better
to
meet
it
after
he
had
established
his
authority
than
while
discipline
was
at
loose
ends
but
hilda
and
max
were
disappointed
they
were
in
the
habit
of
talking
over
the
incidents
and
problems
of
the
day
every
night
after
supper
and
while
hilda
as
max
used
to
say
had
a
mind
of
her
own
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
seeing
things
much
as
max
saw
them
max
had
from
the
start
admired
in
his
boyish
way
peterson
big
muscles
and
his
easy
good
nature
he
had
been
the
first
to
catch
the
new
spirit
that
bannon
had
got
into
the
work
but
it
was
more
the
outward
activity
that
he
could
understand
and
admire
than
bannon
finer
achievements
in
organization
like
hilda
he
did
not
see
the
difference
between
dropping
a
hammer
down
a
bin
and
overloading
a
hoist
bannon
distinction
between
running
risks
in
order
to
push
the
work
and
using
caution
in
minor
matters
was
not
recognized
in
their
talks
and
as
bannon
was
not
in
the
habit
of
giving
his
reasons
the
misunderstanding
grew
but
more
than
all
max
felt
and
in
a
way
hilda
felt
too
that
peterson
would
never
have
found
it
necessary
to
use
a
revolver
his
fists
would
have
been
enough
for
a
dozen
reillys
max
did
not
tell
hilda
about
all
the
conversations
he
and
peterson
had
had
during
the
last
week
for
they
were
confidential
peterson
had
never
been
without
a
confidant
and
though
he
still
shared
a
room
with
bannon
he
could
not
talk
his
mind
out
with
him
max
who
to
bannon
was
merely
an
unusually
capable
was
to
peterson
a
friend
and
adviser
and
though
max
tried
to
defend
bannon
when
peterson
fell
into
criticism
of
the
way
the
work
was
going
he
was
influenced
by
it
during
the
few
days
after
the
accident
hilda
was
so
deeply
distressed
about
the
injured
man
that
max
finally
went
to
see
him
he
pretty
well
taken
care
of
he
said
when
he
returned
some
ribs
broken
he
says
and
a
little
fever
but
it
ai
serious
he
got
a
couple
of
sneaking
little
lawyers
around
trying
to
get
him
to
sue
for
damages
but
i
do
think
he
do
it
the
company
giving
him
full
pay
and
all
his
doctor
bills
nearly
every
evening
after
that
max
took
him
some
little
delicacy
hilda
made
him
promise
that
he
would
not
tell
who
sent
them
bannon
had
quickly
caught
the
changed
attitude
toward
him
and
for
several
days
kept
his
own
counsel
but
one
morning
after
dictating
some
letters
to
hilda
he
lingered
how
our
fund
getting
on
he
said
smiling
have
you
looked
lately
no
she
said
i
have
he
leaned
over
the
railing
and
opened
the
box
it
coming
slow
he
said
shaking
his
head
are
you
sure
been
getting
away
from
us
hilda
was
seated
before
the
typewriter
she
turned
partly
around
without
taking
her
fingers
from
the
keys
i
do
know
she
said
quietly
i
have
been
watching
it
we
have
to
be
stricter
about
it
said
bannon
these
fellows
have
got
to
understand
that
rules
are
rules
he
spoke
with
a
little
laugh
but
the
remark
was
unfortunate
the
only
men
who
came
within
the
railing
were
max
and
peterson
i
may
have
forgotten
it
myself
she
said
that
wo
do
you
know
i
do
know
but
what
i
can
let
you
off
this
time
i
tell
you
what
i
do
miss
vogel
i
make
a
new
rule
that
you
can
come
in
without
wiping
your
feet
if
you
hand
in
a
written
excuse
that
the
way
they
did
things
when
i
went
to
school
he
turned
to
go
then
hesitated
again
you
have
been
out
on
the
job
yet
have
you
no
i
have
i
rather
think
you
like
it
it
pretty
work
now
that
we
framing
the
cupola
if
you
say
so
i
fix
it
for
you
to
go
up
to
the
distributing
floor
this
afternoon
she
looked
back
at
the
machine
the
view
ai
bad
he
went
on
when
you
get
up
there
you
can
see
down
into
indiana
and
all
around
you
could
see
all
chicago
too
if
it
was
for
the
smoke
there
was
a
moment
silence
why
yes
bannon
she
said
i
like
to
go
very
much
all
right
he
replied
his
smile
returning
i
guarantee
to
get
you
up
there
somehow
if
i
have
to
build
a
stairway
ninety
feet
pretty
high
you
know
when
bannon
reached
the
elevator
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
well
at
the
west
end
of
the
structure
this
well
or
stairway
bin
sixteen
by
feet
and
open
from
the
ground
to
the
distributing
floor
occupied
the
space
of
two
bins
it
was
here
that
the
stairway
would
be
and
the
passenger
elevator
and
the
for
the
transmission
of
power
from
the
working
to
the
distributing
floor
the
stairway
was
barely
indicated
by
rude
landings
for
the
present
a
series
of
eight
ladders
zigzagged
up
from
landing
to
landing
bannon
began
climbing
halfway
up
he
met
max
who
was
coming
down
time
book
in
hand
look
here
max
he
said
we
going
to
have
visitors
this
afternoon
if
you
got
a
little
extra
time
i
like
to
have
you
help
get
things
ready
all
right
max
replied
i
not
crowded
very
hard
i
asked
your
sister
to
come
up
and
see
the
framing
max
glanced
down
between
the
loose
boards
on
the
landing
i
do
know
he
said
slowly
i
do
believe
she
could
climb
up
here
very
well
she
wo
have
to
i
going
to
put
in
a
passenger
elevator
and
carry
her
up
as
grand
as
the
palmer
house
you
put
in
your
odd
minutes
between
now
and
three
making
a
box
that
big
and
strong
enough
max
grinned
say
that
all
right
she
like
that
i
can
do
most
of
it
at
noon
bannon
nodded
and
went
on
up
the
ladders
at
the
distributing
floor
he
looked
about
for
a
long
timber
and
had
the
laborers
lay
it
across
the
well
opening
the
ladders
and
landings
occupied
only
about
a
third
of
the
space
the
rest
was
open
a
clear
drop
of
eighty
feet
at
noon
he
found
max
in
an
open
space
behind
the
office
screwing
iron
rings
into
the
corners
of
a
stout
box
max
glanced
up
and
laughed
i
made
hilda
promise
not
to
come
out
here
he
said
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
back
wall
of
the
office
bannon
saw
that
he
had
nailed
strips
over
the
larger
cracks
and
knot
holes
she
was
peeking
but
i
shut
that
off
before
i
got
very
far
along
i
do
think
she
saw
what
it
was
i
only
had
part
of
the
frame
done
she
be
coming
out
in
a
minute
said
bannon
i
know
i
thought
of
that
max
threw
an
armful
of
burlap
sacking
over
the
box
that
cover
it
up
enough
i
guess
it
time
to
quit
anyway
if
i
going
to
get
any
dinner
there
a
little
square
of
carpet
up
to
the
house
that
i
going
to
get
for
the
bottom
and
we
can
run
pieces
of
rope
from
the
rings
up
to
a
hook
and
sling
it
right
on
the
hoist
it
not
going
on
the
hoist
said
bannon
i
would
stop
the
timbers
for
macbride
himself
when
you
go
back
you
see
a
timber
on
the
top
of
the
well
i
like
you
to
sling
a
block
under
it
and
run
an
rope
through
we
haul
it
up
from
below
what
power
man
power
all
right
bannon
i
see
to
it
there
hilda
now
he
called
to
her
to
wait
while
he
got
his
coat
and
then
the
two
disappeared
across
the
tracks
hilda
had
bowed
to
bannon
but
without
the
smile
and
the
nod
that
he
liked
he
looked
after
her
as
if
he
would
follow
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
waited
a
few
minutes
the
elevator
was
ready
soon
after
the
afternoon
work
had
commenced
bannon
found
time
between
two
and
three
to
inspect
the
tackle
he
picked
up
an
end
of
rope
and
lashed
the
cross
timber
down
securely
then
he
went
down
the
ladders
and
found
max
who
had
brought
the
carpet
for
the
box
and
was
looking
over
his
work
the
rope
led
up
to
the
top
of
the
well
through
a
pulley
and
then
back
to
the
working
floor
and
through
another
pulley
so
that
the
box
could
be
hoisted
from
below
it
all
ready
said
max
it
run
up
as
smooth
as
you
want
you
better
go
for
your
sister
then
bannon
replied
max
hesitated
you
meant
for
me
to
bring
her
yes
i
guess
you
might
as
well
bannon
stood
looking
after
max
as
he
walked
along
the
railroad
track
out
into
the
open
air
then
he
glanced
up
between
the
smooth
walls
of
cribbing
that
seemed
to
draw
closer
and
closer
together
until
they
ended
far
overhead
in
a
rectangle
of
blue
sky
the
beam
across
the
top
was
a
black
line
against
the
light
the
rope
hanging
from
it
swayed
lazily
he
walked
around
the
box
examining
the
rings
and
the
four
corner
ropes
and
testing
them
hilda
was
laughing
when
she
came
with
max
along
the
track
bannon
could
not
see
her
at
first
for
the
intervening
rows
of
timbers
that
supported
the
bins
then
she
came
into
view
through
an
opening
between
two
bents
of
timber
beyond
a
heap
of
rubbish
that
had
been
thrown
at
one
side
of
the
track
she
was
trying
to
walk
on
the
rail
one
arm
thrown
out
to
balance
the
other
resting
across
max
shoulders
her
jacket
was
buttoned
snugly
up
to
the
chin
and
there
was
a
fresh
color
in
her
face
bannon
had
called
in
three
laborers
to
man
the
rope
they
stood
at
one
side
awaiting
the
order
to
haul
away
he
found
a
block
of
wood
and
set
it
against
the
box
for
a
step
this
way
miss
vogel
he
called
the
elevator
starts
in
a
minute
you
came
pretty
near
being
late
am
i
going
to
get
in
that
she
asked
and
she
looked
up
with
a
little
gasp
along
the
dwindling
rope
here
said
max
do
you
say
nothing
against
that
elevator
i
call
it
pretty
grand
she
stood
on
the
block
holding
to
one
of
the
ropes
and
looking
alternately
into
the
box
and
up
to
the
narrow
sky
above
them
it
awfully
high
she
said
is
that
little
stick
up
there
all
going
to
hold
me
up
that
little
stick
is
max
replied
it
would
hold
a
dozen
of
you
she
laughed
but
still
hesitated
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
looked
about
the
great
dim
space
of
the
working
story
with
its
long
aisles
and
its
solid
masses
of
timber
suddenly
she
turned
to
bannon
who
was
standing
at
her
side
waiting
to
give
her
a
hand
oh
bannon
she
said
are
you
sure
it
strong
enough
it
look
safe
i
think
it
safe
he
replied
quietly
he
vaulted
into
the
box
and
signalled
to
the
laborers
hilda
stepped
back
off
the
block
as
he
went
up
perhaps
a
third
of
the
way
and
then
came
down
she
said
nothing
but
stepped
on
the
block
how
shall
i
get
in
she
asked
laughing
a
little
but
not
looking
at
bannon
here
said
bannon
give
us
each
a
hand
a
little
jump
do
it
max
here
go
along
the
ladders
and
steady
you
if
you
swing
too
much
wait
a
minute
though
he
hurried
out
of
doors
and
returned
with
a
light
line
one
end
of
which
he
made
fast
to
the
box
the
other
he
gave
to
max
now
he
said
you
can
guide
it
as
nice
as
walking
upstairs
they
started
up
hilda
sitting
in
the
box
and
holding
tightly
to
the
sides
max
climbing
the
ladders
with
the
end
of
the
line
about
his
wrist
bannon
joined
the
laborers
and
kept
a
hand
on
the
hoisting
rope
you
better
not
look
down
he
called
after
her
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
bannon
waited
until
they
had
reached
the
top
and
max
had
lifted
her
out
on
the
last
landing
then
at
shout
he
made
the
rope
fast
and
followed
up
the
ladders
he
found
them
waiting
for
him
near
the
top
of
the
well
we
might
as
well
sit
down
he
said
he
led
the
way
to
a
timber
a
few
steps
away
well
miss
vogel
how
do
you
like
it
she
was
looking
eagerly
about
at
the
frame
a
great
skeleton
of
new
timber
some
of
it
still
holding
so
much
of
the
water
of
river
and
that
it
glistened
in
the
sunlight
at
the
moving
groups
of
men
the
figure
of
peterson
standing
out
above
the
others
on
a
high
girder
his
arms
knotted
and
his
neck
bare
though
the
day
was
not
warm
at
the
straining
hoist
trembling
with
each
new
load
that
came
swinging
from
somewhere
below
to
be
hustled
off
to
its
place
stick
by
stick
and
then
out
into
the
west
where
the
november
sun
was
dropping
and
around
at
the
hazy
flats
and
the
strip
of
a
river
she
drew
in
her
breath
quickly
and
looked
up
at
bannon
with
a
nervous
little
gesture
i
like
it
she
finally
said
after
a
long
silence
during
which
they
had
watched
a
big
stick
go
up
on
one
of
the
small
hoists
to
be
swung
into
place
and
driven
home
on
the
dowel
pins
by
peterson
sledge
is
pete
a
hummer
said
max
i
never
yet
saw
him
take
hold
of
a
thing
that
was
too
much
for
him
neither
hilda
nor
bannon
replied
to
this
and
there
was
another
silence
would
you
like
to
walk
around
and
see
things
closer
to
bannon
asked
turning
to
miss
vogel
i
would
mind
it
rather
cold
sitting
still
he
led
the
way
along
one
side
of
the
structure
guiding
her
carefully
in
places
where
the
flooring
was
not
yet
secure
i
glad
you
came
up
he
said
a
good
many
people
think
nothing
in
this
kind
of
work
but
just
sawing
wood
and
making
money
for
somebody
up
in
minneapolis
but
it
is
that
way
it
pretty
and
sometimes
it
exciting
and
things
happen
every
little
while
that
are
interesting
enough
to
tell
to
anybody
if
people
only
knew
it
i
have
you
come
up
a
little
later
when
we
get
the
house
built
and
the
machinery
coming
in
that
when
we
have
things
really
moving
there
be
some
fun
putting
up
the
belt
gallery
too
that
be
over
here
on
the
other
side
he
turned
to
lead
the
way
across
the
floor
to
the
north
side
of
the
building
they
had
stopped
a
little
way
from
the
boom
hoist
and
she
was
standing
motionless
watching
as
the
boom
swung
out
and
the
rope
rattled
to
the
ground
there
was
the
puffing
of
the
engine
far
below
the
straining
of
the
rope
and
the
creaking
of
the
blocks
as
the
heavy
load
came
slowly
up
gangs
of
men
were
waiting
to
take
the
timbers
the
moment
they
reached
the
floor
the
foreman
of
the
hoist
gang
was
leaning
out
over
the
edge
looking
down
and
shouting
orders
hilda
turned
with
a
little
start
and
saw
that
bannon
was
waiting
for
her
following
him
she
picked
her
way
between
piles
of
planks
and
timber
and
between
groups
of
laborers
and
carpenters
to
the
other
side
now
they
could
look
down
at
the
four
tracks
of
the
the
unfinished
spouting
house
on
the
wharf
and
the
river
here
where
the
belt
gallery
will
go
he
said
pointing
downward
right
over
the
tracks
to
the
spouting
house
they
carry
the
grain
on
endless
belts
you
know
does
it
ever
fall
off
not
a
kernel
it
pretty
to
watch
when
she
gets
to
running
we
come
up
some
day
and
look
at
it
they
walked
slowly
back
toward
the
well
before
they
reached
it
peterson
and
max
joined
them
peterson
had
rolled
down
his
sleeves
and
put
on
his
coat
you
ai
going
down
now
are
you
he
said
we
be
starting
in
pretty
soon
on
some
of
the
heavy
framing
this
is
just
putting
in
girders
he
was
speaking
directly
to
miss
vogel
but
he
made
an
effort
to
include
bannon
in
the
conversation
by
an
awkward
movement
of
his
head
this
stiffness
in
peterson
manner
when
bannon
was
within
hearing
had
been
growing
more
noticeable
during
the
past
few
days
do
you
think
of
going
yet
he
continued
with
a
nervous
laugh
for
hilda
was
moving
on
she
need
be
in
such
a
rush
to
get
to
work
eh
charlie
hilda
did
not
give
bannon
a
chance
to
reply
thank
you
very
much
peterson
she
said
smiling
but
i
must
go
back
really
maybe
you
tell
me
some
day
when
you
going
to
do
something
special
so
i
can
come
up
again
peterson
disappointment
was
so
frankly
shown
in
his
face
that
she
smiled
again
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
she
said
she
was
still
looking
at
peterson
but
at
the
last
word
she
turned
to
include
bannon
as
if
she
had
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
in
the
party
there
was
an
uncomfortable
feeling
shown
by
all
in
their
silence
and
in
their
groping
about
for
something
to
say
i
go
ahead
and
clear
the
track
said
bannon
i
holler
up
to
you
max
when
we
ready
down
below
here
said
max
let
me
go
down
but
bannon
had
already
started
down
the
first
ladder
the
next
time
you
come
to
visit
us
miss
vogel
he
called
back
i
guess
we
have
our
real
elevator
in
and
we
can
run
you
up
so
fast
it
take
your
breath
away
we
be
real
swells
here
yet
when
he
reached
the
working
floor
he
called
in
the
laborers
and
shouted
to
max
but
when
the
box
slowly
descending
appeared
below
the
bin
walls
it
was
peterson
who
held
the
line
and
chatted
with
hilda
as
he
steadied
her
the
next
day
a
lot
of
cribbing
came
from
ledyard
and
bannon
at
once
set
about
reorganizing
his
forces
so
that
work
could
go
on
night
and
day
he
and
peterson
would
divide
the
time
equally
into
days
but
three
divisions
were
necessary
for
the
men
the
morning
shift
working
from
midnight
until
eight
the
day
shift
from
eight
to
four
and
the
night
shift
from
four
to
midnight
finally
when
the
whistle
blew
at
noon
bannon
tipped
back
his
chair
and
pushed
his
hat
back
on
his
head
well
he
said
that
fixed
when
will
we
begin
on
it
peterson
asked
have
the
whistle
blow
at
four
it
make
some
of
the
men
work
overtime
but
we
pay
them
for
it
miss
vogel
was
putting
on
her
jacket
before
joining
max
who
was
waiting
at
the
door
she
asked
do
you
want
me
to
make
any
change
in
my
work
mr
bannon
no
you
better
go
ahead
just
as
you
are
we
wo
try
to
cut
you
up
into
three
shifts
yet
awhile
we
can
do
what
letters
and
accounts
we
have
in
the
daytime
she
nodded
and
left
the
office
all
through
the
morning
work
peterson
had
worn
a
heavy
puzzled
expression
and
now
that
they
had
finished
he
seemed
unable
to
throw
it
off
bannon
who
had
risen
and
was
reaching
for
his
ulster
which
he
had
thrown
over
the
railing
looked
around
at
him
you
and
i
have
to
make
days
of
it
you
know
he
said
he
knew
from
his
quick
glance
and
the
expression
almost
of
relief
that
came
over
his
face
that
this
was
what
peterson
had
been
waiting
for
you
better
come
on
in
the
evening
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
at
seven
i
take
it
in
the
morning
and
keep
an
eye
on
it
during
the
day
peterson
eyes
had
lowered
at
the
first
words
he
swung
one
leg
over
the
other
and
picked
up
the
list
of
carpenters
that
max
had
made
out
pretending
to
examine
it
bannon
was
not
watching
him
closely
but
he
could
have
read
the
thoughts
behind
that
sullen
face
if
their
misunderstanding
had
arisen
from
business
conditions
alone
bannon
would
have
talked
out
plainly
but
now
that
hilda
had
come
between
them
and
particularly
that
it
was
all
so
vague
a
matter
of
feeling
and
not
at
all
of
reason
he
had
decided
to
say
nothing
it
was
important
that
he
should
control
the
work
during
the
day
and
coming
on
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
would
have
a
hand
on
the
work
of
all
three
shifts
he
knew
that
peterson
would
not
see
it
reasonably
that
he
would
think
it
was
done
to
keep
him
away
from
hilda
he
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
to
keep
it
open
buttoning
his
ulster
coming
on
up
to
the
house
pete
peterson
got
down
off
the
railing
so
you
going
to
put
me
on
the
night
shift
he
said
almost
as
a
child
would
have
said
it
i
guess
that
the
way
it
got
to
work
out
bannon
replied
coming
up
no
not
yet
i
be
along
pretty
soon
bannon
started
toward
the
door
but
turned
with
a
snap
of
his
finger
oh
while
we
at
it
pete
you
better
tell
max
to
get
those
men
to
keep
time
for
the
night
shifts
you
mean
you
want
him
to
go
on
with
you
in
the
daytime
that
just
as
he
likes
but
i
guess
he
want
to
be
around
while
his
sister
is
here
you
see
about
that
after
lunch
will
you
peterson
came
in
while
bannon
was
eating
his
dinner
and
stayed
after
he
had
gone
in
the
evening
when
he
returned
to
the
house
for
his
supper
after
arranging
with
peterson
to
share
the
first
night
work
bannon
found
that
the
foreman
clothes
and
grip
had
been
taken
from
the
room
on
the
stairs
he
met
the
landlady
and
asked
her
if
peterson
had
moved
yes
she
replied
he
took
his
things
away
this
noon
i
sorry
gone
for
he
was
a
good
young
man
he
never
give
me
any
trouble
like
some
of
the
men
do
that
been
here
the
trouble
with
most
of
them
is
that
they
get
drunk
on
and
come
home
simply
disgusting
bannon
passed
on
without
comment
during
the
evening
he
saw
peterson
on
the
distributing
floor
helping
the
man
from
the
electric
light
company
rig
up
a
new
arc
light
his
expression
when
he
caught
sight
of
bannon
sullen
and
defiant
yet
showing
a
great
effort
to
appear
natural
was
the
only
explanation
needed
of
how
matters
stood
between
them
it
took
a
few
days
to
get
the
new
system
to
running
smoothly
new
carpenters
and
laborers
had
to
be
taken
on
and
new
foremen
worked
into
their
duties
but
it
proved
to
be
less
difficult
than
max
and
hilda
had
supposed
from
what
peterson
had
to
say
about
the
conduct
of
the
work
the
men
all
worked
better
than
before
each
new
move
of
bannon
seemed
to
infuse
more
vigor
and
energy
into
the
work
and
the
cupola
and
annex
began
rapidly
as
max
said
to
look
like
something
bannon
was
on
hand
all
day
and
frequently
during
a
large
part
of
the
night
he
had
a
way
of
appearing
at
any
hour
to
look
at
the
work
and
keep
it
moving
max
after
hearing
the
day
men
repeat
what
the
night
men
had
to
tell
of
the
boss
and
his
work
said
to
his
sister
honest
hilda
i
do
see
how
he
does
it
i
do
believe
he
ever
takes
his
clothes
off
chapter
ix
the
direct
result
of
the
episode
with
the
carpenter
reilly
was
insignificant
he
did
not
attempt
to
make
good
his
boast
that
he
would
be
back
at
work
next
day
and
when
he
did
appear
on
wednesday
of
the
next
week
his
bleared
eyes
and
dilapidated
air
made
the
reason
plain
enough
a
business
agent
of
his
union
was
with
him
bannon
found
them
in
the
office
he
nodded
to
the
delegate
sit
down
he
said
then
he
turned
to
reilly
i
do
ask
you
to
do
the
same
you
not
wanted
on
the
premises
i
told
you
once
before
that
i
was
through
talking
reilly
started
to
reply
but
his
companion
checked
him
that
all
right
he
said
i
know
your
side
of
it
wait
for
me
up
by
the
car
line
when
reilly
had
gone
bannon
repeated
his
invitation
to
sit
down
you
probably
know
why
i
come
the
delegate
began
reilly
has
charged
you
with
treating
him
unjustly
and
with
drawing
a
revolver
on
him
of
course
in
a
case
like
this
we
try
to
get
at
both
sides
before
we
take
any
action
would
you
give
me
your
account
of
it
bannon
told
in
twenty
words
just
how
it
had
happened
the
agent
said
cautiously
reilly
told
another
story
i
suppose
so
now
i
do
ask
you
to
take
my
word
against
his
if
you
like
to
investigate
the
business
i
give
you
all
the
opportunity
you
want
if
we
find
that
he
did
drop
the
hammer
by
accident
would
you
be
willing
to
take
him
back
bannon
smiled
there
no
use
in
my
telling
you
what
i
do
till
you
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
is
there
bannon
held
out
his
hand
when
the
man
rose
to
go
any
time
you
think
there
something
wrong
out
here
or
anything
you
do
understand
come
out
and
we
talk
it
over
i
treat
a
man
as
well
as
i
can
if
he
square
with
me
he
walked
to
the
door
with
the
agent
and
closed
it
after
him
as
he
turned
back
to
the
draughting
table
he
found
hilda
eyes
on
him
they
very
clean
chaps
mostly
those
walking
delegates
he
said
if
you
treat
half
as
well
as
you
treat
a
yellow
dog
likely
to
be
very
reasonable
if
one
of
does
happen
to
be
a
rascal
though
he
meaner
to
handle
than
frozen
dynamite
i
expect
to
be
before
i
through
with
that
man
grady
is
he
a
rascal
she
asked
he
as
bad
as
you
find
even
if
he
been
handled
right
bannon
broke
off
abruptly
and
began
turning
over
the
blue
prints
suppose
i
better
see
how
this
next
story
looks
he
said
hilda
had
heard
how
pete
had
dealt
with
grady
at
their
first
meeting
and
she
could
complete
the
broken
sentence
bannon
never
heard
whether
the
agent
from
the
carpenters
union
had
looked
further
into
reilly
case
but
he
was
not
asked
to
take
him
back
on
the
pay
roll
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
incident
coming
out
on
the
distributing
floor
just
before
noon
on
thursday
he
found
grady
in
the
act
of
delivering
an
impassioned
oration
to
the
group
of
laborers
about
the
hoist
before
grady
saw
him
bannon
had
come
near
enough
to
hear
something
about
being
driven
at
the
point
of
a
pistol
the
speech
came
suddenly
to
an
end
when
grady
following
the
glances
of
his
auditors
turned
and
saw
who
was
coming
bannon
noted
with
satisfaction
the
scared
look
of
appeal
which
he
turned
for
a
second
toward
the
men
it
was
good
to
know
that
grady
was
something
of
a
coward
bannon
nodded
to
him
pleasantly
enough
how
are
you
grady
he
said
seeing
that
he
was
in
no
danger
the
delegate
threw
back
his
shoulders
held
up
his
head
and
frowning
in
an
important
manner
he
returned
bannon
greeting
with
the
scantest
civility
bannon
walked
up
and
stood
beside
him
if
you
can
spare
the
time
he
said
politely
i
like
to
see
you
at
the
office
for
a
while
convinced
now
that
bannon
was
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
conciliate
him
grady
grew
more
important
very
well
he
said
when
i
got
through
up
here
ye
can
see
me
if
ye
like
all
right
said
bannon
patiently
no
hurry
during
the
full
torrent
of
grady
eloquence
the
work
had
not
actually
been
interrupted
the
big
boom
bearing
its
load
of
timber
swept
in
over
the
distributing
floor
with
unbroken
regularity
but
the
men
had
worked
with
only
half
their
minds
and
had
given
as
close
attention
as
they
dared
to
the
delegate
fervid
utterances
but
from
the
moment
bannon
appeared
there
had
been
a
marked
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
little
audience
they
steered
the
hoist
and
canted
the
timbers
about
with
a
sudden
enthusiasm
which
made
bannon
smile
a
little
as
he
stood
watching
them
grady
could
not
pump
up
a
word
to
say
he
cleared
his
throat
loudly
once
or
twice
but
the
men
ignored
him
utterly
he
kept
casting
his
shifty
little
sidewise
glances
at
the
boss
wondering
why
he
did
go
away
but
bannon
continued
to
stand
there
giving
an
occasional
direction
and
watching
the
progress
of
the
work
with
much
satisfaction
the
little
delegate
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
cleared
his
throat
again
then
he
saw
that
two
or
three
of
the
men
were
grinning
that
was
too
much
well
i
go
with
you
he
snapped
bannon
could
not
be
sure
how
much
of
an
impression
grady
big
words
and
his
ridiculous
assumption
of
importance
had
made
upon
the
men
but
he
determined
to
counteract
it
as
thoroughly
as
possible
then
and
there
it
was
a
sort
of
gallery
play
that
he
had
decided
on
but
he
felt
sure
it
would
prove
effective
grady
turned
to
go
down
as
he
had
come
up
by
the
ladders
but
bannon
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
saying
with
a
laugh
oh
do
waste
your
time
walking
take
the
elevator
his
tone
was
friendly
but
his
grip
was
like
a
and
he
was
propelling
grady
straight
toward
the
edge
of
the
building
four
big
timbers
had
just
come
up
and
bannon
caught
the
released
rope
as
it
came
trailing
by
here
he
said
put
your
foot
in
the
hook
and
hang
on
and
you
come
down
in
no
time
grady
laughed
nervously
no
you
do
i
suppose
you
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
that
way
you
do
come
that
on
me
the
men
were
watching
with
interest
bannon
raised
his
voice
a
little
all
right
he
said
thrusting
his
foot
into
the
great
hook
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
we
have
a
regular
passenger
elevator
in
here
by
and
by
with
an
electric
bell
and
sliding
door
for
the
capitalist
crowd
that
are
going
to
own
the
place
but
we
workingmen
get
along
all
right
on
this
swing
off
boys
he
waited
for
grady
down
below
it
mattered
very
little
to
him
now
whether
the
walking
delegate
chose
to
follow
him
down
the
hoist
or
to
walk
down
on
the
ladders
for
every
one
had
seen
that
grady
was
afraid
bannon
had
seen
all
the
men
grinning
broadly
as
he
began
his
descent
and
that
was
all
he
wanted
evidently
grady
fear
of
the
rope
was
less
than
his
dread
of
the
ridicule
of
the
men
for
bannon
saw
him
preparing
to
come
down
after
the
next
load
he
took
a
long
time
getting
ready
but
at
last
they
started
him
he
was
the
color
of
a
handful
of
waste
when
he
reached
the
ground
and
he
staggered
as
he
walked
with
bannon
over
to
the
office
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
well
said
bannon
do
you
like
the
look
of
things
i
hope
you
find
anything
out
of
the
way
do
you
dare
ask
me
that
grady
began
his
voice
was
weak
at
first
but
as
his
giddiness
passed
away
it
arose
again
to
its
own
inimitable
oratorical
level
do
you
dare
pretend
that
you
are
treating
these
men
right
who
gave
you
the
right
to
decide
that
this
man
shall
live
and
this
man
shall
die
and
that
this
poor
fellow
who
asks
no
more
than
to
be
allowed
to
earn
his
honest
living
with
his
honest
sweat
shall
be
stricken
down
with
two
broken
ribs
i
do
know
said
bannon
you
speaking
of
the
hoist
accident
i
suppose
well
go
and
ask
that
man
if
he
has
any
complaint
to
make
if
he
has
come
and
let
me
know
about
it
they
call
this
a
free
country
and
yet
you
oppressors
can
compel
men
to
risk
their
lives
have
you
any
changes
to
suggest
in
the
way
that
hoist
is
rigged
bannon
cut
in
quietly
you
been
inspecting
it
what
did
you
think
was
unsafe
about
it
grady
was
getting
ready
for
his
next
outburst
but
bannon
prevented
him
there
ai
many
jobs
if
you
leave
out
tacking
down
carpets
where
a
man
do
risk
his
life
more
or
less
macbride
do
compel
men
to
risk
their
lives
he
pays
for
doing
it
and
you
can
bet
he
done
it
himself
we
do
like
it
but
it
necessary
now
if
you
saw
men
out
there
taking
risks
that
you
think
are
unnecessary
why
say
so
and
we
talk
it
over
there
another
thing
you
got
to
answer
for
bannon
these
are
free
men
that
are
devoting
their
honest
labor
to
you
you
may
think
you
a
slave
driver
but
you
are
you
may
flourish
your
revolver
in
the
faces
of
slaves
but
free
american
citizens
will
resent
it
grady
the
man
i
drew
a
gun
on
was
a
carpenter
his
own
union
is
looking
after
him
he
had
thrown
a
hammer
down
into
a
bin
where
some
of
your
laborers
were
at
work
so
i
acted
in
their
defence
grady
stood
up
i
come
here
to
give
you
warning
bannon
there
is
a
watchful
eye
on
you
the
next
time
i
come
it
will
not
be
to
warn
but
to
act
that
all
i
got
to
say
to
you
now
bannon
too
was
on
his
feet
grady
we
try
to
be
fair
to
our
men
it
your
business
to
see
that
we
are
fair
so
we
ought
to
get
on
all
right
together
after
this
if
the
men
lodge
any
complaint
with
you
come
to
me
do
go
out
on
the
job
and
make
speeches
if
you
looking
for
fair
play
you
get
it
if
you
looking
for
trouble
you
get
it
the
new
in
operation
at
the
elevator
was
more
of
a
hardship
to
peterson
than
to
any
one
else
because
it
compelled
him
to
be
much
alone
not
only
was
he
quite
cut
off
from
the
society
of
max
and
hilda
but
it
happened
that
the
two
or
three
whom
he
liked
best
were
on
the
day
shift
the
night
work
with
none
of
those
pleasant
little
momentary
interruptions
that
used
to
occur
in
the
daytime
was
mere
unrelieved
drudgery
but
the
afternoons
when
he
had
given
up
trying
to
sleep
any
longer
were
tedious
enough
to
make
him
long
for
six
naturally
his
disposition
was
easy
and
generous
but
he
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
much
and
thinking
especially
as
it
led
to
brooding
was
not
good
for
him
from
the
first
of
course
he
had
been
hurt
that
the
office
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
send
bannon
to
supersede
him
but
so
long
as
he
had
plenty
to
do
and
was
in
company
every
hour
of
the
day
he
had
not
taken
time
to
think
about
it
much
but
now
he
thought
of
little
else
and
as
time
went
on
he
succeeded
in
twisting
nearly
everything
the
new
boss
had
said
or
done
to
fit
his
theory
that
bannon
was
jealous
of
him
and
was
trying
to
take
from
him
the
credit
which
rightfully
belonged
to
him
and
bannon
had
put
him
in
charge
of
the
night
shift
so
peterson
came
to
think
simply
because
he
had
seen
that
hilda
was
beginning
to
like
him
about
four
one
afternoon
not
many
days
after
grady
talk
with
bannon
peterson
sat
on
the
steps
of
his
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
and
wishing
it
were
six
he
wanted
to
stroll
down
to
the
job
to
have
a
chat
with
his
friends
but
he
had
somewhat
childishly
decided
he
was
wanted
there
while
miss
vogel
was
in
the
office
so
he
sat
still
and
whittled
and
took
another
view
of
his
grievances
glancing
up
he
saw
grady
the
walking
delegate
coming
along
the
sidewalk
now
that
the
responsibility
of
the
elevator
was
off
his
shoulders
he
no
longer
cherished
any
particular
animosity
toward
the
little
irishman
but
he
remembered
their
last
encounter
and
wondered
whether
he
should
speak
to
him
or
not
but
grady
solved
his
doubt
by
calling
out
cheerfully
to
know
how
he
was
and
turning
in
toward
the
steps
i
suppose
i
ought
to
lick
you
after
what
passed
between
us
he
added
with
a
broad
smile
but
if
willing
we
call
it
bygones
sure
said
peterson
it
fine
seasonable
weather
we
having
and
just
the
thing
for
you
on
the
elevator
it
coming
right
along
it
as
interesting
a
bit
of
work
as
i
ever
saw
i
was
there
the
other
day
looking
at
it
and
by
the
way
i
had
a
long
talk
with
bannon
he
a
fine
man
grady
had
seated
himself
on
the
step
below
peterson
now
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
him
he
a
good
hustler
said
peterson
well
that
what
passes
for
a
fine
man
these
days
though
mistakes
are
sometimes
made
that
way
but
how
does
it
happen
that
you
not
down
there
superintending
i
hope
some
carpenter
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fire
the
boss
i
not
boss
there
any
longer
the
office
sent
bannon
down
to
take
it
over
my
head
you
do
tell
me
that
it
a
pity
grady
was
shaking
his
head
solemnly
it
a
pity
the
men
like
you
peterson
not
saying
they
do
like
anybody
else
but
they
like
you
but
people
in
an
office
a
thousand
miles
away
ca
know
everything
and
that
a
fact
and
so
he
laid
you
off
oh
no
i
ai
quite
laid
off
yet
he
put
me
in
charge
of
the
night
shift
so
you
working
nights
then
it
seemed
to
me
you
was
working
fast
enough
in
the
daytime
to
satisfy
anybody
but
i
suppose
some
rich
man
is
in
a
hurry
for
it
and
you
must
do
your
best
to
accommodate
him
you
bet
he
in
a
hurry
for
it
he
wo
listen
to
reason
at
all
says
the
bins
have
got
to
be
chock
full
of
grain
before
january
first
no
matter
what
happens
to
us
he
do
care
how
much
it
costs
either
i
must
be
going
along
said
grady
getting
to
his
feet
that
man
must
be
in
a
hurry
january
first
that
quick
work
and
he
do
care
how
much
it
costs
him
oh
these
rich
devils
they
hustlers
too
peterson
well
to
you
peterson
saw
bannon
twice
every
day
for
a
half
hour
at
night
when
he
took
charge
of
the
job
and
for
another
half
hour
in
the
morning
when
he
relinquished
it
that
was
all
except
when
they
chanced
to
meet
during
bannon
irregular
nightly
wanderings
about
the
elevator
as
the
days
had
gone
by
these
conversations
had
been
confined
more
and
more
rigidly
to
necessary
business
and
though
this
result
was
peterson
own
bringing
about
still
he
charged
it
up
as
another
of
his
grievances
against
bannon
when
about
an
hour
after
his
conversation
with
grady
he
started
down
to
the
elevator
to
take
command
he
knew
he
ought
to
tell
bannon
of
his
conversation
with
grady
and
he
fully
intended
doing
so
but
his
determination
oozed
away
as
he
neared
the
office
and
when
he
finally
saw
bannon
he
decided
to
say
nothing
about
it
whatever
he
decided
thus
partly
because
he
wished
to
make
his
conversation
with
bannon
as
short
as
possible
partly
because
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
what
significance
if
any
the
incident
had
and
more
than
either
of
these
reasons
because
ever
since
grady
had
repeated
the
phrase
he
care
what
it
costs
him
peterson
had
been
uneasily
aware
that
he
had
talked
too
much
chapter
x
grady
affairs
were
prospering
beyond
his
expectations
confident
though
he
had
been
away
back
in
the
summer
when
the
work
was
in
its
early
stages
his
eye
had
been
upon
it
he
had
bided
his
time
in
the
somewhat
indefinite
hope
that
something
would
turn
up
but
he
went
away
jubilant
from
his
conversation
with
peterson
for
it
seemed
that
all
the
cards
were
in
his
hands
just
as
a
man
running
for
a
car
is
the
safest
mark
for
a
snowball
so
calumet
k
through
being
a
rush
job
as
well
as
a
rich
one
offered
a
particularly
advantageous
field
for
grady
endeavors
men
who
were
trying
to
accomplish
the
impossible
feat
of
completing
at
any
cost
the
great
hulk
on
the
river
front
before
the
first
of
january
would
not
be
likely
to
stop
to
quibble
at
paying
the
five
thousand
dollars
or
so
that
grady
who
as
the
business
agent
of
his
union
was
simply
in
masquerade
would
like
to
extort
he
had
heard
that
peterson
was
somewhat
disaffected
to
authority
but
had
not
expected
him
to
make
so
frank
an
avowal
of
it
that
was
almost
as
much
in
his
favor
as
the
necessity
for
hurry
these
with
the
hoist
accident
to
give
a
color
of
respectability
to
the
operation
ought
to
make
it
simple
enough
he
had
wit
enough
to
see
that
bannon
was
a
much
harder
man
to
handle
than
peterson
and
that
with
peterson
restored
to
full
authority
the
only
element
of
uncertainty
would
be
removed
and
he
thought
that
if
he
could
get
peterson
to
help
him
it
might
be
possible
to
secure
bannon
recall
if
the
scheme
failed
he
had
still
another
shot
in
his
locker
but
this
one
was
worth
a
trial
anyway
one
afternoon
in
the
next
week
he
went
around
to
and
sent
up
his
card
with
as
much
ceremony
as
though
the
night
boss
had
been
a
railway
president
i
hope
you
can
spare
me
half
an
hour
peterson
there
a
little
matter
of
business
i
like
to
talk
over
with
you
the
word
affected
peterson
unpleasantly
that
was
a
little
farther
than
he
could
go
without
a
qualm
sure
he
said
uneasily
looking
at
his
watch
i
do
know
as
i
should
call
it
business
either
grady
went
on
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
it
a
matter
of
friendship
for
surely
it
no
business
of
mine
maybe
you
think
it
queer
i
think
it
queer
myself
that
i
should
be
coming
tendering
my
friendly
services
to
a
man
who
had
his
hands
on
my
throat
threatening
my
life
that
my
way
but
somehow
i
like
you
peterson
and
there
an
end
of
it
and
when
i
like
a
man
i
like
him
too
how
the
elevator
everything
going
to
please
you
i
guess
it
going
all
right
it
ai
pete
hesitated
and
then
gave
up
the
broken
sentence
it
all
right
he
repeated
grady
smiled
there
the
good
soldier
wo
talk
against
his
general
but
peterson
let
me
ask
you
a
question
answer
me
as
a
man
of
sense
which
makes
the
best
general
the
man
who
leads
the
charge
straight
up
to
the
intrenchments
yellin
on
boys
or
the
one
who
says
very
likely
shaking
a
revolver
in
their
faces
in
there
ye
damn
privates
and
take
that
fort
and
report
to
me
when
i
finished
my
breakfast
which
one
of
those
two
men
will
the
soldiers
do
the
most
for
for
the
one
they
like
best
peterson
and
do
forget
it
and
which
one
of
these
are
they
going
to
like
best
do
you
suppose
the
brave
leader
who
scorns
to
ask
his
men
to
go
where
he
would
go
himself
who
is
ashamed
to
do
honest
work
with
honest
hands
whose
fists
are
good
enough
to
defend
him
against
his
enemies
or
the
man
who
is
afraid
to
go
out
among
the
men
without
a
revolver
in
his
hip
pocket
answer
me
as
a
man
of
sense
mr
peterson
peterson
was
manifestly
disturbed
by
the
last
part
of
the
harangue
now
he
said
oh
i
guess
bannon
was
scared
when
he
drawed
that
gun
on
reilly
he
ai
that
kind
would
draw
a
gun
on
an
unarmed
defenceless
man
grady
asked
earnestly
no
i
would
i
do
like
that
way
of
doing
the
men
do
like
it
either
peterson
no
more
than
you
do
they
like
you
they
do
anything
you
ask
them
to
they
know
that
you
can
do
anything
that
they
can
but
peterson
i
be
frank
with
you
they
do
like
the
man
who
crowded
you
out
that
putting
it
mild
i
say
they
hate
him
for
an
uncivil
sneaking
weasel
of
a
spy
i
never
knew
bannon
to
do
anything
like
that
said
peterson
slowly
i
did
did
he
come
sneaking
up
and
hear
what
i
was
saying
up
on
top
of
the
elevator
the
other
day
i
guess
he
wo
try
that
again
i
told
him
that
when
i
was
ready
to
talk
to
i
come
down
to
the
office
to
do
it
grady
was
going
almost
too
far
pete
would
not
stand
very
much
more
already
he
was
trying
to
get
on
his
feet
to
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
i
ask
your
pardon
peterson
i
forgot
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
but
the
point
is
right
here
the
men
do
like
him
been
wanting
to
strike
these
three
days
just
because
they
do
want
to
work
for
that
ruffian
i
soothed
them
all
i
can
but
they
wo
hold
in
much
longer
mark
my
words
there
be
a
strike
on
your
hands
before
the
week
out
unless
you
do
something
pretty
soon
what
have
they
got
to
strike
about
do
we
treat
them
all
right
what
do
they
kick
about
a
good
many
things
big
and
little
but
the
real
reason
is
the
one
been
giving
you
bannon
neither
more
nor
less
do
you
mean
they
be
all
right
if
another
man
was
in
charge
grady
could
not
be
sure
from
peterson
expression
whether
the
ice
were
firm
enough
to
step
out
boldly
upon
or
not
he
tested
it
cautiously
peterson
i
know
you
a
good
man
i
know
you
a
generous
man
i
know
you
would
want
to
crowd
bannon
out
of
his
shoes
the
way
he
crowded
you
out
of
yours
not
even
after
the
way
he
treated
you
but
look
here
peterson
who
your
duty
to
the
men
up
in
minneapolis
who
pay
your
salary
or
the
man
who
has
come
down
here
and
is
giving
orders
over
your
head
no
just
let
me
finish
peterson
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
but
do
your
employers
want
to
get
the
job
done
by
new
year
they
do
do
they
pay
you
to
help
get
it
done
they
do
will
it
be
done
if
that
murderer
of
a
bannon
is
allowed
to
stay
here
it
will
not
you
can
bet
on
that
then
it
your
duty
to
get
him
out
of
here
and
going
to
help
you
do
it
grady
was
on
his
feet
when
he
declaimed
the
last
sentence
he
flung
out
his
hand
toward
pete
shake
on
it
he
cried
peterson
had
also
got
to
his
feet
but
more
slowly
he
did
not
take
the
hand
i
much
obliged
grady
he
said
it
very
kind
in
you
if
that
so
as
you
say
i
suppose
he
have
to
go
and
he
go
all
right
without
any
shoving
when
he
sees
that
it
is
so
you
go
and
tell
just
what
you
told
me
to
charlie
bannon
he
boss
on
this
job
grady
would
have
fared
better
with
a
man
of
quicker
intelligence
peterson
was
so
slow
at
catching
the
blackmailer
drift
that
he
spoke
in
perfectly
good
faith
when
he
made
the
suggestion
that
he
tell
bannon
and
grady
went
away
a
good
deal
perplexed
as
to
the
best
course
to
pursue
whether
to
go
directly
to
bannon
or
to
try
the
night
boss
again
as
for
peterson
four
or
five
times
during
his
talk
with
bannon
at
the
office
that
evening
he
braced
himself
to
tell
the
boss
what
grady
had
said
but
it
was
not
till
just
as
bannon
was
going
home
that
it
finally
came
out
have
you
seen
grady
lately
pete
asked
as
calmly
as
he
could
he
was
around
here
something
more
than
a
week
ago
gave
me
a
little
bombthrowers
anniversary
oratory
about
oppressors
and
a
watchful
eye
there
no
use
paying
any
attention
to
him
yet
he
thinks
he
got
some
trouble
cooking
for
us
on
the
stove
but
we
have
to
wait
till
he
turns
it
into
the
dish
he
ai
as
dangerous
as
he
thinks
he
is
he
been
around
to
see
me
lately
twice
he
has
what
did
he
want
with
you
when
was
it
he
came
the
first
time
about
a
week
ago
that
was
nothing
but
a
little
friendly
talk
but
friendly
him
what
did
he
have
to
say
why
it
was
nothing
i
do
remember
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
was
laid
off
and
i
told
him
i
was
on
the
night
shift
was
that
all
pretty
near
he
wanted
to
know
what
we
was
in
such
a
hurry
about
working
nights
and
i
said
we
had
to
be
through
by
january
first
then
he
said
he
supposed
it
must
be
for
some
rich
man
who
did
care
how
much
it
cost
him
and
i
said
yes
it
was
that
was
all
he
did
mean
nothing
we
were
just
passing
the
time
of
day
i
do
see
any
harm
in
that
bannon
was
leaning
on
the
rail
his
face
away
from
peterson
after
a
while
he
spoke
thoughtfully
well
that
cinches
it
i
guess
he
meant
to
hold
us
up
anyway
but
now
he
knows
we
a
good
thing
how
that
i
do
see
said
peterson
but
bannon
made
no
reply
what
did
he
have
to
offer
the
next
time
he
came
around
more
in
the
same
friendly
way
when
was
it
just
this
afternoon
why
he
said
he
was
afraid
we
have
a
strike
on
our
hands
he
ought
to
know
said
bannon
did
he
give
any
reason
yes
he
did
you
wo
mind
my
speaking
it
right
out
i
guess
he
said
the
men
did
like
you
and
if
you
was
recalled
they
likely
strike
he
said
they
work
under
me
if
you
was
recalled
but
he
think
he
could
keep
from
going
out
if
you
stayed
that
ai
what
i
think
mind
you
i
just
telling
you
what
he
said
then
he
kind
of
insinuated
that
i
ought
to
do
something
about
it
myself
that
made
me
tired
and
i
told
him
to
come
to
you
about
it
i
said
you
was
the
boss
here
now
and
i
was
only
the
foreman
of
the
night
shift
until
that
last
sentence
bannon
had
been
only
half
listening
he
made
no
sign
indeed
of
having
heard
anything
but
stood
hacking
at
the
pine
railing
with
his
he
was
silent
so
long
that
at
last
peterson
arose
to
go
bannon
shut
his
knife
and
wheeled
around
to
face
him
hold
on
pete
he
said
we
better
talk
this
business
out
right
here
talk
out
what
oh
i
guess
you
know
why
do
we
pull
together
better
what
is
it
you
sore
about
nothing
you
do
need
to
worry
about
it
look
here
pete
you
known
me
a
good
many
years
do
you
think
square
i
never
said
you
was
square
you
might
have
given
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
anyway
i
know
you
did
like
my
coming
down
here
to
take
charge
do
you
suppose
i
did
you
were
unlucky
and
a
man
working
for
macbride
ca
afford
to
be
unlucky
so
he
told
me
to
come
and
finish
the
job
and
once
i
was
down
here
he
held
me
responsible
for
getting
it
done
i
got
to
go
ahead
just
the
best
i
can
i
thought
you
saw
that
at
first
and
that
we
get
on
all
right
together
but
lately
it
been
different
i
thought
i
been
working
hard
enough
to
satisfy
anybody
it
ai
that
and
you
know
it
ai
it
just
the
spirit
of
the
thing
now
i
do
ask
you
to
tell
me
why
it
is
you
feel
this
way
if
you
want
to
talk
it
out
now
all
right
if
you
do
all
right
again
but
if
you
ever
think
i
not
using
you
right
come
to
me
and
say
so
just
look
at
what
we
got
to
do
here
pete
before
the
first
of
january
sometimes
i
think
we
can
do
it
and
sometimes
i
think
we
ca
but
we
got
to
anyway
if
we
do
macbride
will
just
make
up
his
mind
we
no
good
and
unless
we
pull
together
we
stuck
for
sure
it
ai
a
matter
of
work
entirely
i
want
to
feel
that
i
got
you
with
me
come
around
in
the
afternoon
if
you
happen
to
be
awake
and
fuss
around
and
tell
me
what
i
doing
wrong
i
want
to
consult
you
about
a
good
many
things
in
the
course
of
a
day
pete
face
was
simply
a
lens
through
which
one
could
see
the
feelings
at
work
beneath
and
bannon
knew
that
he
had
struck
the
right
chord
at
last
how
is
it
does
that
go
sure
said
pete
i
never
knew
you
wanted
to
consult
me
about
anything
or
i
have
been
around
before
friday
afternoon
bannon
received
a
note
from
grady
saying
that
if
he
had
any
regard
for
his
own
interests
or
for
those
of
his
employers
he
would
do
well
to
meet
the
writer
at
ten
sunday
morning
at
a
certain
downtown
hotel
it
closed
with
a
postscript
containing
the
disinterested
suggestion
that
delays
were
dangerous
and
a
hint
that
the
writer
time
was
valuable
and
he
wished
to
be
informed
whether
the
appointment
would
be
kept
or
not
bannon
ignored
the
note
and
all
day
monday
expected
grady
appearance
at
the
office
he
did
not
come
but
when
bannon
reached
his
about
eight
that
evening
he
found
grady
in
his
room
waiting
for
him
i
ca
talk
on
an
empty
stomach
said
the
boss
cheerfully
as
he
was
washing
up
just
wait
till
i
get
some
supper
i
wait
said
grady
grimly
when
bannon
came
back
to
talk
he
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
down
astride
a
chair
well
grady
when
you
came
here
before
you
said
it
was
to
warn
me
but
the
next
time
you
came
you
were
going
to
begin
to
act
all
ready
all
right
said
grady
with
a
vicious
grin
be
as
smart
as
you
like
i
be
paid
well
for
every
word
of
it
and
for
every
minute
you
kept
me
waiting
yesterday
and
that
was
the
most
expensive
supper
you
ever
ate
i
thought
you
had
sense
enough
to
come
bannon
that
why
i
wasted
a
stamp
on
you
you
made
the
biggest
mistake
of
your
life
during
the
speech
bannon
had
sat
like
a
man
hesitating
between
two
courses
of
action
at
this
point
he
interrupted
let
get
to
business
mr
grady
i
get
to
it
fast
enough
and
when
i
do
you
see
if
you
can
safely
insult
the
representative
of
the
mighty
power
of
the
honest
workingman
of
this
vast
land
well
i
hear
you
folks
are
in
a
hurry
mr
bannon
yes
and
that
you
spend
anything
it
costs
to
get
through
on
time
it
suit
you
to
have
all
your
laborers
strike
about
now
do
that
idea
make
you
sick
pretty
near
well
they
will
strike
inside
two
days
what
for
suppose
we
settle
with
them
direct
just
try
that
said
grady
with
withering
sarcasm
just
try
that
and
see
how
it
works
i
do
want
to
i
only
wanted
to
hear
you
confess
that
you
are
a
rascal
you
pay
dear
for
giving
me
that
name
but
we
come
to
that
later
do
you
think
it
would
be
worth
something
to
the
men
who
hire
you
for
a
dirty
to
be
protected
against
a
strike
would
they
be
willing
to
pay
a
round
sum
to
get
this
work
done
on
time
take
a
minute
to
think
about
it
be
careful
how
you
tell
me
they
would
you
not
liked
here
bannon
by
anybody
you
threatening
to
have
me
recalled
according
to
your
suggestions
to
peterson
the
other
night
well
that
all
right
if
you
can
do
it
but
i
think
that
sooner
than
recall
me
or
have
a
strike
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
protection
you
do
i
did
look
for
that
much
sense
in
you
if
you
shown
it
sooner
it
might
have
saved
your
employers
a
large
wad
of
bills
if
taken
the
trouble
to
be
decent
when
i
went
to
you
in
a
friendly
way
a
very
little
would
have
been
enough
but
now
i
got
to
be
paid
what
do
you
say
to
five
thousand
as
a
fair
sum
they
be
willing
to
pay
fully
that
to
save
delay
said
bannon
cheerfully
they
would
to
save
his
life
grady
could
not
help
looking
crestfallen
it
seemed
then
that
he
might
have
got
fifty
all
right
he
went
on
five
thousand
it
is
and
i
want
it
in
bills
you
do
cried
bannon
jumping
to
his
feet
do
you
think
you
going
to
get
a
cent
of
it
i
might
pay
blackmail
to
an
honest
rascal
who
delivered
the
goods
paid
for
but
i
had
your
size
the
first
time
you
came
around
do
you
think
i
knew
what
you
wanted
if
i
thought
you
were
worth
buying
i
have
settled
it
up
for
three
hundred
dollars
and
a
box
of
cigars
right
at
the
start
that
about
your
market
price
but
as
long
as
i
knew
you
sell
us
out
again
if
you
could
i
did
think
you
were
even
worth
the
cigars
no
do
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
go
out
and
do
it
if
you
can
and
get
out
of
here
for
the
second
time
bannon
took
the
little
delegate
by
the
arm
he
marched
him
to
the
head
of
the
long
straight
flight
of
stairs
then
he
hesitated
a
moment
i
wish
you
were
three
sizes
larger
he
said
chapter
xi
the
organization
of
labor
unions
is
generally
democratic
the
local
lodge
is
it
elects
its
delegate
who
attends
a
council
of
and
this
council
may
send
representatives
to
a
still
more
powerful
body
but
however
high
their
titles
or
their
salaries
these
dignitaries
have
power
only
to
suggest
action
except
in
a
very
limited
variety
of
cases
there
must
always
be
a
reference
back
to
the
rank
and
file
the
real
decision
lies
with
them
that
is
the
theory
the
laborers
on
calumet
k
with
some
others
at
work
in
the
neighborhood
had
organized
into
a
lodge
and
had
affiliated
with
the
american
federation
of
labor
grady
who
had
appeared
out
of
nowhere
who
had
urged
upon
them
the
need
of
combining
against
the
forces
of
oppression
and
had
induced
them
to
organize
had
been
without
dissent
elected
delegate
he
was
nothing
more
in
theory
than
this
simply
their
concentrated
voice
and
this
theory
had
the
fond
support
of
the
laborers
he
not
our
boss
he
our
servant
was
a
sentiment
they
never
tired
of
uttering
when
the
delegate
was
out
of
earshot
they
met
every
friday
night
debated
passed
portentous
resolutions
and
listened
to
grady
oratory
after
the
meeting
was
over
they
liked
to
hear
their
delegate
their
servant
talk
mysteriously
of
the
doings
of
the
council
and
so
well
did
grady
manage
this
air
of
mystery
that
each
man
thought
it
assumed
because
of
the
presence
of
others
but
that
he
himself
was
of
the
inner
circle
they
would
not
have
dreamed
of
questioning
his
acts
in
meeting
or
after
as
they
stood
about
the
dingy
reeking
hall
over
barry
saloon
it
was
only
as
they
went
to
their
lodgings
in
groups
of
two
and
three
that
they
told
how
much
better
they
could
manage
things
themselves
bannon
enjoyed
his
last
conversation
with
grady
though
it
left
him
a
good
deal
to
think
out
afterward
he
had
acted
quite
deliberately
had
said
nothing
that
afterward
he
wished
unsaid
but
as
yet
he
had
not
decided
what
to
do
next
after
he
heard
the
door
slam
behind
the
little
delegate
he
walked
back
into
his
room
paced
the
length
of
it
two
or
three
times
then
put
on
his
ulster
and
went
out
he
started
off
aimlessly
paying
no
attention
to
whither
he
was
going
and
consequently
he
walked
straight
to
the
elevator
he
picked
his
way
across
the
tracks
out
to
the
wharf
and
seated
himself
upon
an
empty
nail
keg
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
spouting
house
he
sat
there
for
a
long
while
heedless
of
all
that
was
doing
about
him
turning
the
situation
over
and
over
in
his
mind
like
a
good
strategist
he
was
planning
grady
campaign
as
carefully
as
his
own
finally
he
was
recalled
to
his
material
surroundings
by
a
rough
voice
which
commanded
get
off
that
keg
and
clear
out
we
do
allow
no
loafers
around
here
turning
bannon
recognized
one
of
the
that
a
good
idea
he
said
are
you
making
a
regular
patrol
or
did
you
just
happen
to
see
me
i
did
know
it
was
you
no
i
tending
to
some
work
here
in
the
spouting
house
do
you
know
where
peterson
is
he
was
right
up
here
a
bit
ago
do
you
want
to
see
him
yes
if
he
is
busy
i
not
the
only
loafer
here
it
seems
added
bannon
nodding
toward
where
the
indistinct
figures
of
a
man
and
a
woman
could
be
seen
coming
slowly
toward
them
along
the
narrow
strip
of
wharf
between
the
building
and
the
water
never
mind
he
added
as
the
foreman
made
a
step
in
their
direction
i
look
after
them
myself
the
moment
after
he
had
called
the
foreman
attention
to
them
he
had
recognized
them
as
hilda
and
max
he
walked
over
to
meet
them
we
get
enough
of
it
in
the
daytime
can
we
it
a
great
place
for
a
girl
is
it
bannon
said
max
i
was
coming
over
here
and
hilda
made
me
bring
her
along
she
said
she
thought
it
must
look
pretty
at
night
does
it
she
asked
do
you
think
it
does
mr
bannon
he
had
been
staring
at
it
for
half
an
hour
now
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
it
for
ninety
feet
up
into
the
air
the
large
mass
was
one
unrelieved
unbroken
shadow
barely
distinguishable
from
the
night
sky
that
enveloped
it
above
was
the
skeleton
of
the
cupola
made
brilliant
fairly
dazzling
in
contrast
by
scores
of
arc
lamps
at
that
distance
and
in
that
confused
tangle
of
light
and
shadow
the
great
timbers
of
the
frame
looked
spidery
the
effect
was
that
of
a
luminous
crown
upon
a
gigantic
head
i
guess
you
are
right
he
said
slowly
but
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way
before
and
i
done
more
or
less
night
work
too
a
moment
later
peterson
came
up
having
a
tea
party
out
here
he
asked
then
turning
to
bannon
was
there
something
special
you
wanted
charlie
i
got
to
go
over
to
the
main
house
pretty
soon
it
our
friend
grady
he
come
down
to
business
at
last
he
wants
money
hilda
was
quietly
signalling
max
to
come
away
and
bannon
observing
it
broke
off
to
speak
to
them
do
go
he
said
we
have
a
brief
council
of
war
right
here
so
hilda
was
seated
on
the
nail
keg
while
bannon
resting
his
elbows
on
the
top
of
a
spile
which
projected
waist
high
through
the
floor
of
the
wharf
expounded
the
situation
you
understand
his
proposition
he
said
addressing
hilda
rather
than
either
of
the
men
it
just
plain
blackmail
he
says
you
want
your
laborers
to
strike
you
have
to
pay
my
price
not
much
pete
broke
in
i
let
the
elevator
rot
before
i
pay
a
cent
of
blackmail
page
would
said
bannon
shortly
or
macbride
neither
they
be
glad
to
pay
five
thousand
or
so
for
protection
but
they
want
protection
that
would
protect
grady
trying
to
sell
us
a
gold
brick
he
hated
us
to
begin
with
and
when
he
struck
us
for
about
all
he
thought
we
stand
he
call
the
men
off
just
the
same
and
leave
us
to
waltz
the
timbers
around
all
by
ourselves
how
much
did
he
want
all
he
could
get
i
think
he
have
been
satisfied
with
a
thousand
but
he
come
next
week
for
a
thousand
more
what
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
that
a
cigar
was
a
bigger
investment
than
i
cared
to
make
on
him
and
that
when
we
paid
blackmail
it
would
be
to
some
fellow
who
deliver
the
goods
i
said
he
could
begin
to
make
trouble
just
as
soon
as
he
pleased
seems
to
me
you
might
have
asked
for
a
few
days
time
to
decide
then
we
could
have
got
something
ready
to
come
at
him
with
he
liable
to
call
our
men
out
ai
he
i
do
think
so
i
thought
of
trying
to
stave
him
off
for
a
few
days
but
then
i
thought
he
see
through
that
game
and
he
go
on
with
his
scheme
for
sewing
us
up
just
the
same
you
see
there
no
good
saying
we
afraid
so
i
told
him
that
we
did
mind
him
a
bit
said
he
could
go
out
and
have
all
the
fun
he
liked
with
us
if
he
thinks
we
got
something
up
our
sleeve
he
may
be
a
little
cautious
anyway
he
knows
that
our
biggest
rush
is
coming
a
little
later
and
he
likely
to
wait
for
it
then
hilda
spoke
for
the
first
time
has
he
so
much
power
as
that
will
they
strike
just
because
he
orders
them
to
why
not
exactly
said
bannon
they
decide
that
for
themselves
or
at
least
they
think
they
do
they
vote
on
it
well
then
she
asked
hesitatingly
why
ca
you
just
tell
the
men
what
grady
wants
you
to
do
and
show
them
that
he
dishonest
they
know
they
been
treated
all
right
do
they
bannon
shook
his
head
no
use
he
said
you
see
these
fellows
know
much
they
are
like
skilled
laborers
who
need
some
sense
in
their
business
they
just
common
roustabouts
and
most
of
have
gunpowder
in
place
of
brains
they
do
want
facts
or
reason
either
what
they
like
is
grady
oratory
they
think
that
the
finest
thing
they
ever
heard
they
might
all
be
perfectly
satisfied
and
anxious
to
work
but
if
grady
was
to
sing
out
to
know
if
they
wanted
to
be
slaves
they
all
strike
like
a
freight
train
rolling
down
grade
no
he
went
on
there
nothing
to
be
done
with
the
men
do
you
know
what
would
happen
if
i
was
to
go
up
to
their
lodge
and
tell
right
out
that
grady
was
a
blackmailer
why
after
they
got
through
with
me
personally
they
pass
a
resolution
vindicating
grady
they
resolve
that
i
was
a
thief
and
a
liar
and
a
murderer
and
an
oppressor
of
the
poor
and
a
traitor
and
if
they
could
think
of
anything
more
than
that
they
put
it
in
too
and
after
vindicating
grady
to
their
satisfaction
they
take
his
word
for
law
and
the
gospel
more
than
ever
in
this
sort
of
a
scrape
you
want
to
hit
as
high
as
you
can
strike
the
biggest
man
who
will
let
you
in
his
office
it
the
small
fry
that
make
the
trouble
i
guess
that
true
everywhere
i
know
the
general
manager
of
a
railroad
is
always
an
easier
chap
to
get
on
with
than
the
division
superintendent
well
said
pete
after
waiting
a
moment
to
see
if
bannon
had
any
definite
suggestion
to
make
as
to
the
best
way
to
deal
with
grady
glad
you
do
think
he
try
to
tie
us
up
maybe
we
think
of
something
i
got
to
get
back
on
the
job
i
go
up
with
you
said
max
promptly
then
in
answer
to
gesture
of
protest
you
do
want
to
climb
away
up
there
i
be
back
in
ten
minutes
and
he
was
gone
before
she
could
reply
i
guess
i
can
take
care
of
you
till
he
comes
back
said
bannon
hilda
made
no
answer
she
seemed
to
think
that
silence
would
conceal
her
annoyance
better
than
anything
she
could
say
so
after
waiting
a
moment
bannon
went
on
talking
i
suppose
that
the
reason
why
i
get
ugly
sometimes
and
call
names
because
i
ai
a
big
enough
man
not
to
if
i
was
getting
thousand
a
year
maybe
i
be
as
smooth
as
anybody
i
like
to
be
a
general
manager
for
a
while
just
to
see
how
it
would
work
i
do
see
how
anybody
could
ever
know
enough
to
run
a
railroad
hilda
was
looking
up
at
the
right
of
way
where
red
and
white
semaphore
lights
were
winking
i
was
offered
that
job
once
myself
though
and
turned
it
down
said
bannon
i
was
superintendent
of
the
electric
light
plant
at
yawger
yawger
quite
a
place
on
a
branch
of
the
there
was
another
road
ran
through
the
town
called
the
bemis
yawger
and
pacific
it
went
from
bemis
to
stiles
corners
a
place
about
six
miles
west
of
yawger
it
did
get
any
nearer
the
pacific
than
that
nobody
in
yawger
ever
went
to
bemis
or
stiles
and
there
was
anybody
in
bemis
and
stiles
to
come
to
yawger
or
if
they
did
come
they
never
went
back
so
the
road
do
a
great
deal
of
business
they
assessed
the
stock
every
year
to
pay
the
officers
salaries
and
they
had
a
full
line
of
officers
too
but
the
rest
of
the
road
had
to
scrub
along
the
best
it
could
when
they
elected
me
alderman
from
the
first
ward
up
at
yawger
i
found
out
that
the
y
owed
the
city
four
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
so
i
tried
to
find
out
why
they
was
made
to
pay
it
seemed
that
the
city
had
had
a
judgment
against
them
for
years
but
they
could
get
hold
of
anything
that
was
worth
seizing
they
all
laughed
at
me
when
i
said
i
meant
to
get
that
money
out
of
the
railroad
had
one
train
there
was
an
engine
and
three
box
cars
and
a
couple
of
flats
and
a
combination
that
baggage
and
passenger
it
made
the
round
trip
from
bemis
every
day
miles
over
all
and
considering
the
roadbed
and
the
engine
that
was
a
good
day
work
well
that
train
was
worth
four
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
all
right
enough
if
they
could
have
got
their
hands
on
it
but
the
engineer
was
such
a
peppery
chap
that
nobody
ever
wanted
to
bother
him
but
i
just
bided
my
time
and
one
hot
day
after
watering
up
the
engine
him
and
the
conductor
went
off
to
get
a
drink
i
had
a
few
lengths
of
log
chain
handy
and
some
laborers
with
picks
and
shovels
and
we
made
a
neat
clean
little
job
of
it
then
i
climbed
up
into
the
cab
when
the
engineer
came
back
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
doing
there
i
told
him
we
attached
his
train
you
try
to
serve
no
papers
on
me
he
sung
out
i
split
your
head
no
papers
about
this
job
said
i
attached
it
to
the
track
at
that
he
dropped
the
fire
shovel
and
pulled
open
the
throttle
the
drivers
spun
around
all
right
but
the
train
never
moved
an
inch
he
calmed
right
down
after
that
and
said
he
had
four
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
with
him
but
if
i
let
the
train
go
he
pay
me
in
a
week
i
could
quite
do
that
so
him
and
the
conductor
had
to
walk
to
bemis
where
the
general
offices
was
they
was
pretty
mad
we
had
that
train
chained
up
there
for
a
month
and
at
last
they
paid
the
claim
was
that
the
railroad
that
offered
to
make
you
general
manager
hilda
asked
yes
provided
i
let
the
train
go
i
glad
i
did
take
it
up
though
you
see
the
farmers
along
the
road
who
held
the
stock
in
it
made
up
their
minds
that
the
train
had
quit
running
for
good
so
they
took
up
the
rails
where
it
ran
across
their
farms
and
used
the
ties
for
firewood
that
all
they
ever
got
out
of
their
investment
a
few
moments
later
max
came
back
and
bannon
straightened
up
to
go
i
wish
you
tell
pete
when
you
see
him
he
said
to
the
boy
that
i
wo
be
on
the
job
till
noon
going
to
take
a
holiday
yes
tell
him
i
taking
the
rest
cure
up
at
a
sanitarium
at
eight
next
morning
bannon
entered
the
outer
office
of
carver
president
of
the
central
district
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
and
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
long
row
of
chairs
that
stood
against
the
wall
most
of
them
were
already
occupied
by
poorly
dressed
men
who
seemed
also
to
be
waiting
for
the
president
one
man
in
dilapidated
dirty
finery
was
leaning
over
the
desk
talking
about
the
last
big
strike
and
guessing
at
the
chance
of
there
being
any
fun
ahead
in
the
immediate
future
but
the
rest
of
them
waited
in
stolid
silent
patience
sitting
quite
still
in
unbroken
rank
along
the
wall
their
overcoats
if
they
had
them
buttoned
tight
around
their
chins
though
the
office
was
stifling
hot
the
dirty
man
who
was
talking
to
the
stenographer
filled
a
pipe
with
some
very
bad
tobacco
and
ostentatiously
began
smoking
it
but
not
a
man
followed
his
example
bannon
sat
in
that
silent
company
for
more
than
an
hour
before
the
great
man
came
even
then
there
was
no
movement
among
those
who
sat
along
the
wall
save
as
they
followed
him
almost
furtively
with
their
eyes
the
president
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
one
of
them
for
all
he
seemed
to
see
the
rank
of
chairs
might
have
been
empty
he
marched
across
to
his
private
office
and
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
sat
down
before
his
desk
bannon
sat
still
a
moment
waiting
for
those
who
had
come
before
him
to
make
the
first
move
but
not
a
man
of
them
stirred
so
somewhat
out
of
patience
with
this
mysteriously
solemn
way
of
doing
business
he
arose
and
walked
into
the
president
office
with
as
much
assurance
as
though
it
had
been
his
own
he
shut
the
door
after
him
the
president
did
not
look
up
but
went
on
cutting
open
his
mail
i
from
macbride
company
of
minneapolis
said
bannon
guess
i
do
know
the
parties
yes
you
do
we
building
a
grain
elevator
at
calumet
the
president
looked
up
quickly
sit
down
he
said
are
you
superintending
the
work
yes
my
name
bannon
charles
bannon
did
you
have
some
sort
of
an
accident
out
there
an
overloaded
hoist
and
you
hurt
a
man
i
believe
yes
and
i
think
one
of
your
foremen
drew
a
revolver
on
a
man
i
did
myself
the
president
let
a
significant
pause
intervene
before
his
next
question
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
want
you
to
help
me
out
it
looks
as
though
we
might
get
into
trouble
with
our
laborers
you
come
to
the
wrong
man
grady
is
the
man
for
you
to
talk
with
he
their
representative
we
have
got
on
very
well
with
grady
the
first
time
he
came
on
the
job
he
did
know
our
rule
that
visitors
must
apply
at
the
office
and
we
were
very
polite
to
him
he
been
down
on
us
ever
since
we
ca
make
any
satisfactory
agreement
with
him
carver
turned
away
impatiently
you
have
to
he
said
if
you
want
to
avoid
trouble
with
your
men
it
no
business
of
mine
he
acting
on
their
instructions
no
he
is
said
bannon
sharply
what
they
want
i
guess
is
to
be
treated
square
and
paid
a
fair
price
what
he
wants
is
blackmail
i
heard
that
kind
of
talk
before
it
the
same
howl
that
an
employer
always
makes
when
he
tried
to
bribe
an
agent
who
active
in
the
interest
of
the
men
and
got
left
at
it
what
have
you
got
to
show
for
it
anything
but
just
your
say
so
bannon
drew
out
grady
letter
of
warning
and
handed
it
to
him
carver
read
it
through
then
tossed
it
on
his
desk
you
certainly
do
offer
that
as
proof
that
he
wants
blackmail
mr
bannon
there
never
any
proof
of
blackmail
when
a
man
can
see
me
alone
he
is
going
to
talk
before
witnesses
and
he
wo
commit
himself
in
writing
grady
told
me
that
unless
we
paid
his
price
he
tie
us
up
no
one
else
was
around
when
he
said
it
then
you
have
anything
but
your
say
so
but
i
know
him
and
i
know
you
do
you
think
i
take
your
word
against
his
that
letter
does
prove
blackmail
said
bannon
but
it
smells
of
it
and
there
the
same
smell
about
everything
grady
has
done
when
he
came
to
my
office
a
day
or
two
after
that
hoist
accident
i
tried
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
and
he
gave
me
nothing
but
oratory
i
tried
to
pin
him
down
to
something
definite
but
my
stenographer
was
there
and
grady
did
have
a
suggestion
to
make
then
by
straining
his
neck
and
asking
questions
he
found
out
we
were
in
a
hurry
that
the
elevator
was
no
good
unless
it
was
done
by
january
first
and
that
we
had
all
the
money
we
needed
two
days
after
he
sent
me
that
letter
look
at
it
again
why
does
he
want
to
take
both
of
us
to
chicago
on
sunday
morning
when
he
can
see
me
any
time
at
my
office
on
the
job
bannon
spread
the
letter
open
before
carver
face
why
does
he
say
right
here
what
it
is
he
wants
if
it
anything
he
dares
to
put
in
black
and
white
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
that
letter
it
did
deserve
any
and
then
will
you
tell
me
why
he
came
to
my
room
at
night
to
see
me
instead
of
to
my
office
in
the
daytime
i
can
prove
that
he
did
does
all
that
look
as
if
i
tried
to
bribe
him
forget
that
we
talking
about
grady
and
tell
me
what
you
think
it
looks
like
carver
was
silent
for
a
moment
that
would
do
any
good
he
said
at
last
if
you
had
proof
that
i
could
act
on
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
i
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
internal
affairs
of
that
lodge
but
if
you
could
offer
proof
that
he
is
what
you
say
he
is
i
could
tell
them
that
if
they
continued
to
support
him
the
federation
withdraws
its
support
but
i
do
see
that
i
can
help
you
as
it
is
i
do
see
any
reason
why
i
should
i
tell
you
why
you
should
because
if
there
any
chance
that
what
i
said
is
true
it
will
be
a
lot
better
for
your
credit
to
have
the
thing
settled
quietly
and
it
wo
be
settled
quietly
if
we
have
to
fight
it
is
very
much
you
have
to
do
just
satisfy
yourself
as
to
how
things
are
going
down
there
see
whether
we
square
or
grady
is
then
when
the
scrap
comes
on
you
know
how
to
act
that
all
do
your
investigating
in
advance
that
just
what
i
have
any
right
to
do
i
ca
mix
up
in
the
business
till
it
comes
before
me
in
the
regular
way
well
said
bannon
with
a
smile
if
you
ca
do
it
yourself
maybe
some
man
you
have
confidence
in
would
do
it
for
you
carver
drummed
thoughtfully
on
his
desk
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
carefully
folded
grady
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
glad
to
have
met
you
bannon
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
good
morning
next
morning
while
bannon
was
opening
his
mail
a
man
came
to
the
timekeeper
window
and
asked
for
a
job
as
a
laborer
guess
we
got
men
enough
said
max
have
we
mr
bannon
the
man
put
his
head
in
the
window
a
fellow
down
in
chicago
told
me
if
i
come
out
here
to
calumet
k
and
ask
bannon
for
a
job
he
give
me
one
are
you
good
up
high
bannon
asked
the
man
smiled
ruefully
and
said
he
was
afraid
not
well
then
returned
bannon
we
have
to
let
you
in
on
the
ground
floor
what
your
name
james
go
over
to
the
tool
house
and
get
a
broom
give
him
a
check
max
chapter
xii
on
the
of
november
bannon
received
this
telegram
charles
bannon
care
of
macbride
company
south
chicago
we
send
complete
drawings
for
marine
tower
which
you
will
build
in
the
middle
of
spouting
house
harahan
company
are
building
the
leg
macbride
bannon
read
it
carefully
folded
it
opened
it
and
read
it
again
then
tossed
it
on
the
desk
we
off
now
for
sure
he
said
to
miss
vogel
i
known
that
was
coming
sure
as
christmas
hilda
picked
it
up
is
there
an
answer
mr
bannon
no
just
file
it
do
you
make
it
out
she
read
it
and
shook
her
head
bannon
ignored
her
cool
manner
it
means
that
your
friends
on
macbride
company
calumet
house
are
going
to
have
the
time
of
their
lives
for
the
next
few
weeks
i
going
to
carry
compressed
food
in
my
pockets
and
when
meal
time
comes
around
just
take
a
capsule
i
think
i
know
she
said
slowly
a
marine
leg
is
the
thing
that
takes
grain
up
out
of
ships
that
right
you
better
move
up
head
and
we
been
building
a
spouting
house
instead
to
load
it
into
ships
we
have
to
build
both
now
you
see
it
getting
around
to
the
time
when
the
pages
be
having
a
fit
every
day
until
the
running
and
every
bin
is
full
and
every
time
they
have
a
fit
the
people
up
at
the
office
have
another
and
they
pass
it
on
to
us
but
why
do
they
want
the
marine
leg
she
asked
any
more
now
than
they
did
at
first
they
got
to
get
the
wheat
down
by
boat
instead
of
rail
that
all
or
likely
it
be
coming
both
ways
there
no
telling
now
behind
it
both
sides
have
got
big
men
fighting
you
seen
it
in
the
papers
have
you
she
nodded
of
course
what
the
papers
say
is
all
true
but
it
lively
doings
all
right
the
next
morning
mail
brought
the
drawings
and
instructions
and
with
them
came
a
letter
from
brown
to
bannon
i
suppose
there
not
much
good
in
telling
you
to
hurry
it
ran
but
if
there
is
another
minute
a
day
you
can
crowd
in
i
guess
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
page
told
me
that
this
elevator
will
make
or
break
them
macbride
says
that
you
can
have
all
january
for
a
vacation
if
you
get
it
through
we
owe
you
two
weeks
off
anyhow
that
you
did
take
last
summer
running
down
that
business
though
i
do
believe
myself
that
they
give
you
any
more
trouble
bannon
read
it
to
hilda
saying
as
he
laid
it
down
that
something
like
i
do
know
where
i
go
though
winter
exactly
the
time
for
a
vacation
unless
you
go
shooting
and
i
no
hand
for
that
could
you
put
it
off
till
summer
she
asked
smiling
a
little
not
much
you
do
know
those
people
by
the
time
summer
come
around
they
have
forgotten
i
ever
worked
here
i
strike
for
a
month
and
brown
would
grin
and
say
all
right
bannon
you
deserve
it
if
anybody
does
it
take
a
week
or
so
to
get
your
pass
arranged
and
you
might
just
run
out
to
san
francisco
and
see
if
things
are
going
the
way
they
ought
to
and
then
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
be
working
three
shifts
somewhere
over
in
china
and
brown
would
be
writing
me
i
was
putting
in
too
much
time
at
my
meals
no
if
macbride
company
offer
you
a
holiday
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
grab
it
and
run
and
saw
off
the
telegraph
poles
behind
you
and
you
could
be
sure
of
yourself
then
he
turned
the
letter
over
in
his
hand
i
might
go
up
on
the
lawrence
he
went
on
that
the
only
place
for
spending
the
winter
that
ever
struck
me
is
it
pretty
cold
it
ai
so
bad
i
was
up
there
last
winter
we
put
up
at
a
house
at
coteau
you
know
when
i
got
there
the
foundation
was
even
begun
and
we
had
a
bad
time
getting
laborers
i
put
in
the
first
day
sitting
on
the
ice
sawing
off
spiles
hilda
laughed
i
should
think
you
care
much
about
going
back
were
you
ever
there
he
asked
no
i
never
been
anywhere
but
home
and
here
in
chicago
where
is
your
home
it
was
up
in
michigan
that
where
max
learned
the
lumber
business
but
he
and
i
have
been
here
for
nearly
two
years
well
said
bannon
some
folks
may
think
it
cold
up
there
but
there
ai
anywhere
else
to
touch
it
it
high
ground
you
know
nothing
like
this
he
swept
his
arm
about
to
indicate
the
flats
outside
and
the
scenery
beats
anything
this
side
of
the
rockies
it
ai
that
there
mountains
there
you
understand
but
it
all
big
and
open
and
they
got
forests
there
that
would
make
your
michigan
pine
woods
look
like
weeds
on
a
sandhill
and
the
river
great
you
have
seen
anything
really
fine
till
you
seen
the
rapids
in
winter
the
people
there
have
a
good
time
too
they
know
how
to
enjoy
life
it
is
all
grime
and
sweat
and
making
money
well
said
hilda
looking
down
at
her
pencil
and
drawing
aimless
designs
as
she
talked
i
suppose
it
is
a
good
place
to
go
i
seen
the
pictures
of
course
in
the
and
one
of
the
railroad
offices
on
clark
street
used
to
have
some
big
photographs
of
the
lawrence
in
the
window
i
looked
at
them
sometimes
but
i
never
thought
of
really
seeing
anything
like
that
i
had
some
pretty
good
times
on
the
lake
and
over
at
joe
max
used
to
take
me
over
to
berrien
springs
last
summer
when
he
could
get
off
my
aunt
lives
there
bannon
was
buttoning
his
coat
and
looking
at
her
he
felt
the
different
tone
that
had
got
into
their
talk
it
had
been
impersonal
a
few
minutes
before
oh
joe
is
bad
he
was
saying
it
quiet
and
restful
and
all
that
but
it
not
the
same
sort
of
thing
at
all
you
go
over
there
and
ride
up
the
river
on
the
may
graham
and
it
makes
you
feel
lazy
and
comfortable
but
it
does
stir
you
up
inside
like
the
lawrence
does
she
looked
up
her
eyes
were
sparkling
as
they
had
sparkled
that
afternoon
on
the
elevator
when
she
first
looked
out
into
the
sunset
yes
she
replied
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
but
i
never
really
felt
that
way
i
only
thought
about
it
bannon
turned
half
away
as
if
to
go
you
have
to
go
down
there
that
all
he
said
abruptly
he
looked
back
at
her
over
his
shoulder
and
added
that
all
there
is
about
it
her
eyes
were
half
startled
half
mischievous
for
his
voice
had
been
still
less
impersonal
than
before
then
she
turned
back
to
her
work
her
face
sober
but
an
amused
twinkle
lingering
in
her
eyes
i
should
like
to
go
she
said
her
pencil
poised
at
the
top
of
a
long
column
max
would
like
it
too
after
supper
that
evening
max
returned
early
from
a
visit
to
the
injured
man
and
told
hilda
of
a
new
trouble
do
you
know
that
little
delegate
that
been
hanging
around
he
asked
grady
she
said
and
nodded
yes
he
been
working
the
man
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
my
life
he
just
sat
up
there
in
bed
and
swore
at
me
and
said
i
need
think
i
could
buy
him
off
with
this
stuff
he
looked
down
and
hilda
saw
that
the
bowl
in
his
hand
was
not
empty
and
raised
a
row
generally
why
she
asked
give
it
up
from
what
he
said
i
sure
grady
behind
it
did
he
give
his
name
no
but
he
did
a
lot
of
talking
about
justice
to
the
and
the
power
of
the
unions
and
that
kind
of
stuff
i
could
understand
all
he
said
he
got
a
funny
lingo
you
know
i
guess
it
polack
but
i
got
enough
to
know
what
he
meant
and
more
too
can
he
do
anything
i
do
think
so
if
we
get
after
him
it
just
set
him
bristles
a
man
like
that
lose
his
head
over
nothing
he
may
be
all
right
in
the
morning
but
hilda
after
max
had
given
her
the
whole
conversation
as
nearly
as
he
could
remember
it
thought
differently
she
did
not
speak
her
mind
out
to
max
because
she
was
not
yet
certain
what
was
the
best
course
to
take
the
man
could
easily
make
trouble
she
saw
that
but
if
max
were
to
lay
the
matter
before
bannon
he
would
be
likely
to
glide
over
some
of
the
details
that
she
had
got
only
by
close
questioning
and
a
blunder
in
handling
it
might
be
fatal
to
the
elevator
so
far
as
getting
it
done
in
december
was
concerned
perhaps
she
took
it
too
seriously
for
she
was
beginning
in
spite
of
herself
to
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
the
work
and
to
bannon
at
any
rate
she
lay
awake
later
than
usual
that
night
going
over
the
problem
and
she
brought
it
up
the
next
morning
the
first
time
that
bannon
came
into
the
office
after
max
had
gone
out
bannon
she
said
when
he
had
finished
dictating
a
letter
to
the
office
i
want
to
tell
you
about
that
man
that
was
hurt
bannon
tried
not
to
smile
at
the
nervous
almost
breathless
way
in
which
she
opened
the
conversation
he
saw
that
whatever
it
was
it
seemed
to
her
very
important
and
he
settled
comfortably
on
the
table
leaning
back
against
the
wall
with
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
she
had
turned
on
her
stool
you
mean
the
hoist
man
he
asked
she
nodded
max
goes
over
to
see
him
sometimes
we
been
trying
to
help
make
him
comfortable
oh
said
bannon
it
you
that
been
sending
those
things
around
to
him
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
why
how
did
you
know
i
heard
about
it
hilda
hesitated
she
did
not
know
exactly
how
to
begin
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
bannon
was
smiling
at
her
eager
manner
max
was
there
last
night
and
he
said
the
man
had
changed
all
around
he
been
friendly
you
know
and
grateful
she
had
forgotten
herself
again
in
thinking
of
her
talk
with
max
and
he
said
all
the
time
that
he
was
going
to
make
trouble
she
paused
yes
i
know
something
about
that
said
bannon
the
lawyers
always
get
after
a
man
that
hurt
you
know
but
last
night
he
had
changed
all
around
he
said
he
was
going
to
have
you
arrested
he
thinks
max
has
been
trying
to
buy
him
off
with
the
things
we
sent
him
bannon
whistled
so
our
grady
got
his
hands
on
him
that
what
max
and
i
thought
but
he
did
give
any
names
he
would
take
the
jelly
i
glad
you
told
me
said
bannon
swinging
his
legs
around
and
sitting
up
it
just
as
well
to
know
about
these
things
grady
made
him
think
he
can
make
a
good
haul
by
going
after
me
poor
fool
he
the
man
that
get
it
can
he
really
stop
the
work
hilda
asked
anxiously
not
likely
he
probably
try
to
make
out
a
case
of
criminal
carelessness
against
me
and
get
me
jerked
up
he
ought
to
have
more
sense
though
i
know
how
many
sticks
were
on
that
hoist
when
it
broke
i
drop
around
there
after
dinner
and
have
a
talk
with
him
i
like
to
find
grady
there
but
that
too
good
to
expect
hilda
had
stepped
down
from
the
stool
and
was
looking
out
through
the
window
at
a
long
train
of
freight
cars
that
was
clanking
in
on
the
belt
line
that
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
most
she
said
slowly
max
says
he
been
warned
that
you
come
around
and
try
to
buy
him
off
and
it
wo
go
because
he
can
make
more
by
standing
out
well
said
bannon
easily
amused
at
her
unconscious
drop
into
language
there
usually
a
way
of
getting
after
these
fellows
do
anything
within
reason
but
we
wo
be
robbed
i
throw
grady
into
the
river
first
and
hang
him
up
on
the
hoist
to
dry
but
if
he
really
means
to
stand
out
she
said
would
it
hurt
us
for
you
to
go
around
there
why
he
was
openly
smiling
now
then
of
a
sudden
he
looked
at
her
with
a
shrewd
close
gaze
and
repeated
why
maybe
i
do
understand
it
she
said
nervously
max
does
think
i
see
things
very
clearly
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
be
willing
for
me
to
see
him
this
evening
i
could
go
with
max
and
she
faltered
when
she
saw
how
closely
he
was
watching
her
but
he
nodded
and
said
go
on
why
i
do
know
that
i
could
do
much
but
no
she
tossed
her
head
back
and
looked
at
him
i
wo
say
that
if
you
let
me
go
i
fix
it
i
know
i
can
bannon
was
thinking
partly
of
her
of
her
slight
graceful
figure
that
leaned
against
the
window
frame
and
of
her
eyes
usually
quiet
but
now
snapping
with
determination
and
partly
of
certain
other
jobs
that
had
been
imperiled
by
the
efforts
of
injured
workingmen
to
get
heavy
damages
one
of
the
things
his
experience
in
railroad
and
engineering
work
had
taught
him
was
that
men
will
take
every
opportunity
to
bleed
a
corporation
no
matter
how
slight
the
accident
or
how
temporary
in
its
effects
the
stupidest
workman
has
it
in
his
power
to
make
trouble
it
was
frankly
not
a
matter
of
sentiment
to
bannon
he
would
do
all
that
he
could
would
gladly
make
the
man
sickness
actually
profit
him
so
far
as
money
would
go
but
he
did
not
see
justice
in
the
great
sums
which
the
average
jury
will
grant
as
he
sat
there
he
recognized
what
hilda
had
seen
at
a
flash
that
this
was
a
case
for
delicate
handling
she
was
looking
at
him
tremendously
in
earnest
yet
all
the
while
wondering
at
her
own
boldness
he
slowly
nodded
you
right
he
said
you
the
one
to
do
the
talking
i
wo
ask
you
what
you
going
to
say
i
guess
you
understand
it
as
well
as
anybody
i
do
know
yet
myself
she
answered
it
is
that
it
is
that
there
something
particular
to
say
but
he
a
poor
man
and
been
telling
him
that
the
company
is
cheating
him
and
stealing
from
him
i
would
like
it
myself
if
i
were
in
his
place
and
did
know
any
more
than
he
does
and
maybe
i
can
show
him
that
we
be
a
good
deal
fairer
to
him
before
we
get
through
than
grady
will
yes
said
bannon
i
think
you
can
and
if
you
can
keep
this
out
of
the
courts
i
write
brown
that
there
a
young
lady
down
here
come
nearer
to
earning
a
big
salary
than
i
ever
did
to
deserving
a
silk
hat
oh
she
said
the
earnest
expression
skipping
abruptly
out
of
her
eyes
did
your
hat
come
not
a
sign
of
it
i
clean
forgotten
i
give
brown
one
more
warning
a
long
telegram
about
forty
words
and
then
if
he
does
toe
up
i
get
one
and
send
him
the
bill
there
was
a
man
that
looked
some
like
grady
worked
for
me
on
the
galveston
house
he
was
a
carpenter
and
thought
he
stood
for
the
whole
federation
of
labor
he
got
gay
one
day
i
warned
him
once
and
then
i
threw
him
off
the
distributing
floor
hilda
thought
he
was
joking
until
she
looked
up
and
saw
his
face
did
it
did
it
kill
him
she
asked
i
do
remember
exactly
i
think
there
were
some
shavings
there
he
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
do
you
know
he
said
if
grady
comes
up
on
the
job
again
i
believe
i
tell
him
that
story
i
wonder
if
he
know
what
i
meant
the
spouting
house
or
river
house
was
a
long
narrow
structure
one
hundred
feet
by
built
on
piles
at
the
edge
of
the
wharf
it
would
form
with
the
connecting
belt
gallery
that
was
to
reach
out
over
the
tracks
a
addition
to
the
elevator
the
river
house
was
no
higher
than
was
necessary
for
the
spouts
that
would
drop
the
grain
through
the
hatchways
of
the
big
lake
steamers
twenty
thousand
bushels
an
hour
it
reached
between
sixty
and
seventy
feet
above
the
water
the
marine
tower
that
was
to
be
built
feet
square
up
through
the
centre
of
the
house
would
be
more
than
twice
as
high
a
careful
examination
convinced
bannon
that
the
pile
foundations
would
prove
strong
enough
to
support
this
heavier
structure
and
that
the
only
changes
necessary
would
be
in
the
frame
of
the
spouting
house
on
the
same
day
that
the
plans
arrived
work
on
the
tower
commenced
peterson
had
about
got
to
the
point
where
startling
developments
no
longer
alarmed
him
he
had
seen
the
telegram
the
day
before
but
his
first
information
that
a
marine
tower
was
actually
under
way
came
when
bannon
called
off
a
group
of
laborers
late
in
the
afternoon
to
rig
the
trolley
for
carrying
timber
across
the
track
what
are
you
going
to
do
charlie
he
called
got
to
slide
them
timbers
back
again
some
of
bannon
replied
do
you
think
we
could
carry
over
said
peterson
if
we
was
quiet
about
it
they
need
be
any
trouble
bannon
shook
his
head
we
not
taking
any
more
chances
on
this
railroad
we
have
time
once
more
the
heavy
timbers
went
swinging
through
the
air
high
over
the
tracks
but
this
time
back
to
the
wharf
before
long
the
section
boss
of
the
appeared
and
though
he
soon
went
away
one
of
his
men
remained
lounging
about
the
tracks
keeping
a
close
eye
on
the
sagging
ropes
and
the
timbers
bannon
when
he
met
peterson
a
few
minutes
later
pointed
out
the
man
what
i
tell
you
pete
they
watching
us
like
cats
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
think
about
us
you
just
drop
one
timber
and
you
find
out
but
nothing
dropped
and
when
peterson
who
had
been
on
hand
all
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
took
hold
at
seven
the
first
timbers
of
the
tower
had
been
set
in
place
somewhere
down
inside
the
rough
shed
of
a
spouting
house
and
more
would
go
in
during
the
night
and
during
other
days
and
nights
until
the
narrow
framework
should
go
reaching
high
into
the
air
another
thing
was
recognized
by
the
men
at
work
on
that
night
shift
even
by
the
laborers
who
carried
timbers
and
grunted
and
swore
in
strange
tongues
this
was
that
the
night
shift
men
had
suddenly
begun
to
feel
a
most
restless
energy
crowding
them
on
and
they
worked
nearly
as
well
as
bannon
day
shifts
for
spirits
had
risen
with
a
leap
once
the
misunderstanding
that
had
been
weighing
on
him
had
been
removed
and
now
he
was
working
as
he
had
never
worked
before
the
directions
he
gave
showed
that
his
head
was
clearer
and
there
was
confidence
in
his
manner
hilda
was
so
serious
all
day
after
her
talk
with
bannon
that
once
in
the
afternoon
when
he
came
into
the
office
for
a
glance
at
the
new
pile
of
blue
prints
he
smiled
and
asked
if
she
were
laying
out
a
campaign
it
was
the
first
work
of
the
kind
that
she
had
ever
undertaken
and
she
was
a
little
worried
over
the
need
for
tact
and
delicacy
after
she
had
closed
her
desk
at
supper
time
she
saw
bannon
come
into
the
circle
of
the
electric
light
in
front
of
the
office
and
asking
max
to
wait
she
went
to
meet
him
well
he
said
are
you
loaded
up
to
fight
the
of
the
union
she
smiled
and
then
said
with
a
trace
of
nervousness
i
do
believe
i
quite
so
sure
about
it
as
i
was
this
morning
it
wo
bother
you
much
when
you
made
him
see
that
we
square
and
grady
is
you
done
the
whole
business
we
wo
pay
fancy
damages
that
all
yes
she
said
i
think
i
know
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
was
was
max
and
i
are
going
over
right
after
supper
and
she
stopped
abruptly
and
bannon
looking
down
at
her
saw
a
look
of
embarrassment
come
into
her
face
and
then
she
blushed
and
lowering
her
eyes
fumbled
with
her
glove
bannon
was
a
little
puzzled
his
eyes
rested
on
her
for
a
moment
and
then
without
understanding
why
he
suddenly
knew
that
she
had
meant
to
ask
him
to
see
her
after
the
visit
and
that
the
new
personal
something
in
their
acquaintance
had
flashed
a
warning
he
spoke
quickly
as
if
he
were
the
first
to
think
of
it
if
you
do
mind
i
come
around
and
hear
the
report
of
the
committee
of
adjusters
that
you
you
know
something
might
come
up
that
i
ought
to
know
right
away
yes
she
replied
rapidly
without
looking
up
perhaps
that
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
he
walked
along
with
her
toward
the
office
where
max
was
waiting
but
she
did
not
say
anything
and
he
turned
in
with
i
wo
say
then
good
luck
to
you
it
was
soon
after
eight
that
bannon
went
to
the
where
hilda
and
max
lived
and
sat
down
to
wait
in
the
parlor
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
gone
and
they
had
not
returned
he
buttoned
up
his
coat
and
went
out
walking
slowly
along
the
uneven
sidewalk
toward
the
river
the
night
was
clear
and
he
could
see
across
the
flats
and
over
the
tracks
where
tiny
signal
lanterns
were
waving
and
circling
and
freight
trains
were
bumping
and
rumbling
the
glow
of
the
arc
lamps
on
the
elevator
and
its
square
outline
against
the
sky
now
and
then
when
the
noise
of
the
switching
trains
let
down
he
could
hear
the
hoisting
engines
once
he
stopped
and
looked
eastward
at
the
clouds
of
illuminated
smoke
above
the
factories
and
at
the
red
blast
of
the
rolling
mill
he
went
nearly
to
the
river
and
had
to
turn
back
and
walk
slowly
finally
he
heard
max
laugh
and
then
he
saw
them
coming
down
a
side
street
well
he
said
you
do
sound
like
bad
news
i
do
believe
we
are
very
bad
replied
hilda
should
say
not
put
in
max
it
silk
hilda
said
max
in
a
low
voice
but
he
went
on
the
best
thing
bannon
was
when
i
told
him
it
was
hilda
that
had
been
sending
things
around
he
thought
it
was
you
you
see
and
told
him
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
game
to
bamboozle
him
out
of
the
money
that
was
rightfully
his
it
funny
to
hear
him
sling
that
grady
talk
around
i
do
think
he
half
knows
what
it
means
i
promised
not
to
tell
you
know
but
i
just
saw
there
was
no
use
trying
to
make
him
understand
things
without
talking
pretty
plain
there
ai
a
thing
he
would
do
for
hilda
now
max
said
hilda
again
please
do
when
they
reached
the
house
max
at
once
started
in
hilda
hesitated
and
then
said
i
come
in
a
minute
max
oh
he
replied
all
right
but
he
waited
a
moment
longer
evidently
puzzled
well
said
bannon
was
it
so
hard
no
not
hard
exactly
i
did
know
he
was
so
poor
somehow
you
think
about
it
that
way
when
you
see
them
working
i
do
know
that
i
ever
thought
about
it
at
all
before
you
think
he
wo
give
us
any
trouble
i
sure
he
wo
i
i
had
to
promise
i
go
again
pretty
soon
maybe
you
let
me
go
along
why
why
yes
of
course
she
had
been
hesitating
looking
down
and
picking
at
the
splinters
on
the
gate
post
neither
was
bannon
quick
to
speak
he
did
not
want
to
question
her
about
the
visit
for
he
saw
that
it
was
hard
for
her
to
talk
about
it
finally
she
straightened
up
and
looked
at
him
i
want
to
tell
you
she
said
i
have
understood
exactly
until
what
they
said
about
the
accident
and
the
way
you
talked
about
it
well
some
people
think
you
do
think
very
much
about
the
men
and
that
if
anybody
hurt
or
anything
happens
you
do
care
as
long
as
the
work
goes
on
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
i
thought
so
too
and
i
found
out
some
things
you
been
doing
for
him
how
you
been
giving
him
tobacco
and
the
things
he
likes
best
that
i
never
have
thought
of
and
i
knew
it
was
you
that
did
it
and
not
the
company
and
i
i
beg
your
pardon
bannon
did
not
know
what
to
reply
they
stood
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
then
she
smiled
and
said
good
night
and
ran
up
the
steps
without
looking
around
chapter
xiii
it
was
the
night
of
the
tenth
of
december
three
of
the
four
stories
of
the
cupola
were
building
and
the
upright
posts
were
reaching
toward
the
fourth
it
still
appeared
to
be
a
confused
network
of
timbers
with
only
the
beginnings
of
walls
but
as
the
cupola
walls
are
nothing
but
a
shell
of
light
boards
to
withstand
the
wind
the
work
was
further
along
than
might
have
been
supposed
down
on
the
working
story
the
machinery
was
nearly
all
in
and
up
here
in
the
cupola
the
scales
and
garners
were
going
into
place
as
rapidly
as
the
completing
of
the
supporting
framework
permitted
the
cupola
floors
were
not
all
laid
if
you
had
stood
on
the
distributing
floor
over
the
tops
of
the
bins
you
might
have
looked
not
only
down
through
a
score
of
openings
between
plank
areas
and
piles
of
timbers
into
black
pits
sixteen
feet
square
by
seventy
deep
but
upward
through
a
grill
of
girders
and
joists
to
the
clear
sky
everywhere
men
swarmed
over
the
work
and
the
buzz
of
the
electric
lights
and
the
sounds
of
hundreds
of
hammers
blended
into
a
confused
hum
if
you
had
walked
to
the
east
end
of
the
building
here
and
there
balancing
along
a
plank
or
dodging
through
gangs
of
laborers
and
around
moving
timbers
you
would
have
seen
stretching
from
off
a
point
not
halfway
through
to
the
ground
the
annex
bins
rising
so
steadily
that
it
was
a
matter
only
of
a
few
weeks
before
they
would
be
ready
to
receive
grain
now
another
walk
this
time
across
the
building
to
the
north
side
would
show
you
the
river
house
out
there
on
the
wharf
and
the
marine
tower
rising
up
through
the
middle
with
a
single
arc
lamp
on
the
topmost
girder
throwing
a
mottled
checkered
shadow
on
the
wharf
and
the
water
below
at
a
little
after
eight
peterson
who
had
been
looking
at
the
stairway
now
nearly
completed
came
out
on
the
distributing
floor
he
was
in
good
spirits
for
everything
was
going
well
and
bannon
had
frankly
credited
him
of
late
with
the
improvement
in
the
work
of
the
night
shifts
he
stood
looking
up
through
the
upper
floors
of
the
cupola
and
he
did
not
see
max
until
the
timekeeper
stood
beside
him
hello
max
he
said
we
have
the
roof
on
here
in
another
ten
days
max
followed
peterson
glance
upward
i
guess
that
right
it
begins
to

was
they
doing

just
looking
on

to

at

head

forward
adding
i

catching
his
arm

bannon
i
go
down
and
tell
him
and
you
keep
an
eye
on
this
fellow
peterson
reluctantly
assented
and
max
walked
slowly
away
now
and
then
pausing
to
look
around
at
the
men
but
when
he
had
nearly
reached
the
stairway
where
he
could
slip
behind
the
scaffolding
about
the
only
scale
hopper
that
had
reached
a
man
height
above
the
floor
he
moved
more
rapidly
he
met
bannon
on
the
stairway
and
told
him
what
he
had
seen
bannon
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
stairway
bin
and
looked
thoughtful
so
he
come
has
he
was
his
only
comment
you
might
speak
to
pete
max
and
bring
him
here
i
wait
max
and
peterson
found
him
looking
over
the
work
of
the
carpenters
i
may
not
be
around
much
he
said
with
a
wink
but
i
like
to
see
both
of
you
afternoon
some
time
can
you
get
around
about
four
pete
sure
the
night
boss
replied
we
got
some
thinking
to
do
about
the
work
if
we
going
to
put
it
through
i
look
for
you
at
four
then
in
the
office
he
started
down
the
stairs
i
going
home
now
why
said
peterson
you
only
just
come
bannon
paused
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
light
came
from
directly
overhead
and
the
upper
part
of
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
of
his
hat
brim
but
max
looking
closely
at
him
thought
that
he
winked
again
i
wanted
to
tell
you
the
foreman
went
on
grady
come
around
you
know
and
another
fellow
yes
max
told
me
i
guess
they
wo
hurt
you
good
night
as
he
went
on
down
he
passed
a
group
of
laborers
who
were
bringing
stairway
material
to
the
carpenters
i
do
know
but
what
you
was
talking
pretty
loud
said
max
to
peterson
in
a
low
voice
here
some
of
now
they
did
hear
nothing
peterson
replied
and
the
two
went
back
to
the
distributing
floor
they
stood
in
a
shadow
by
the
scale
hopper
waiting
for
the
reappearance
of
grady
companion
he
had
evidently
gone
on
to
the
upper
floors
where
he
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
many
other
moving
figures
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
back
walking
deliberately
toward
the
stairs
he
looked
at
peterson
and
max
but
passed
by
without
a
second
glance
and
descended
peterson
stood
looking
after
him
now
i
like
to
know
what
charlie
meant
by
going
home
he
said
max
had
been
thinking
hard
finally
he
said
say
pete
we
blind
why
did
you
think
he
was
going
home
peterson
looked
at
him
but
did
not
reply
because
he
ai
well
you
heard
what
he
said
what
does
that
go
for
he
was
winking
when
he
said
it
he
was
going
to
stand
there
and
tell
the
laborers
all
about
it
like
we
was
trying
to
do
i
bet
he
ai
very
far
off
i
ai
got
a
word
to
say
said
peterson
if
he
wants
to
leave
grady
to
me
i
guess
i
can
take
care
of
him
max
had
come
to
the
elevator
for
a
short
visit
he
liked
to
watch
the
work
at
night
but
now
he
settled
down
to
stay
keeping
about
the
hopper
where
he
could
see
grady
if
his
head
should
appear
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
something
told
him
that
bannon
saw
deeper
into
man
oe
uvres
than
either
peterson
or
himself
and
while
he
could
not
understand
yet
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
grady
would
appear
before
long
and
that
bannon
knew
it
sure
enough
only
a
few
minutes
had
gone
when
max
turned
back
from
a
glance
at
the
marine
tower
and
saw
the
little
delegate
standing
on
the
top
step
looking
about
the
distributing
floor
and
up
through
the
girders
overhead
with
quick
keen
eyes
then
max
understood
what
it
all
meant
grady
had
chosen
a
time
when
bannon
was
least
likely
to
be
on
the
job
and
had
sent
the
other
man
ahead
to
reconnoitre
it
meant
mischief
max
could
see
that
and
he
felt
a
boy
nervousness
at
the
prospect
of
excitement
he
stepped
farther
back
into
the
shadow
grady
was
looking
about
for
peterson
when
he
saw
his
burly
figure
outlined
against
a
light
at
the
farther
end
of
the
building
he
walked
directly
toward
him
not
pausing
this
time
to
talk
to
the
laborers
or
to
look
at
them
max
moving
off
a
little
to
one
side
followed
and
reached
peterson
side
just
as
grady
his
hat
pushed
back
on
his
head
and
his
feet
apart
was
beginning
to
talk
i
had
a
little
conversation
with
you
the
other
day
peterson
i
called
to
see
you
in
the
interests
of
the
men
the
men
that
are
working
for
you
working
like
galley
slaves
they
are
every
man
of
them
shameful
to
a
man
that
seen
how
they
been
treated
by
the
nigger
drivers
that
stands
over
them
day
and
night
he
was
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
with
the
fluency
of
a
man
who
is
carefully
prepared
there
was
none
of
the
bitterness
or
the
ugliness
in
his
manner
that
had
slipped
out
in
his
last
talk
with
bannon
for
he
knew
that
a
score
of
laborers
were
within
hearing
and
that
his
words
would
travel
as
if
by
wire
from
mouth
to
mouth
about
the
building
and
the
grounds
below
i
stand
here
peterson
the
man
chosen
by
these
slaves
of
yours
to
look
after
their
rights
i
do
not
ask
you
to
treat
them
with
kindness
i
do
not
ask
that
you
treat
them
as
gentlemen
what
do
i
ask
i
demand
accorded
to
them
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
declaration
of
independence
that
says
even
a
nigger
has
more
rights
than
you
given
to
these
men
the
men
that
are
putting
money
into
your
pocket
and
bannon
pocket
and
the
corporation
pocket
by
the
sweat
of
their
brows
look
at
them
will
you
look
at
them
he
waved
his
arm
toward
the
nearest
group
who
had
stopped
working
and
were
listening
and
then
placing
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
tilting
it
upward
he
struck
a
match
and
sheltered
it
in
his
hands
looking
over
it
for
a
moment
at
peterson
the
night
boss
saw
by
this
time
that
grady
meant
business
that
his
speech
was
preliminary
to
something
more
emphatic
and
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
stop
it
before
the
laborers
should
be
demoralized
you
ca
do
that
here
mister
said
max
over
peterson
shoulder
indicating
the
cigar
grady
still
held
the
match
and
looked
impudently
across
the
tip
of
his
cigar
peterson
took
it
up
at
once
you
have
to
drop
that
he
said
there
no
smoking
on
this
job
the
match
had
gone
out
and
grady
lighted
another
so
that
one
of
your
rules
too
he
said
in
the
same
loud
voice
it
a
wonder
you
let
a
man
eat
peterson
was
growing
angry
his
voice
rose
as
he
talked
i
ai
got
time
to
talk
to
you
he
said
the
insurance
company
says
there
ca
be
no
smoking
here
if
you
want
to
know
why
you
better
ask
them
grady
blew
out
the
match
and
returned
the
cigar
to
his
pocket
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
that
peterson
could
not
make
out
that
all
right
peterson
i
did
come
here
to
make
trouble
i
come
here
as
a
representative
of
these
men
he
waved
again
toward
the
laborers
and
i
say
right
here
that
if
you
treated
them
right
in
the
first
place
i
would
be
here
at
all
i
wanted
you
to
have
a
fair
show
i
put
up
with
your
mean
tricks
and
threats
and
insults
ever
since
you
begun
and
why
because
i
would
delay
you
and
hurt
the
work
it
the
industries
of
the
elevators
and
railroads
and
the
work
of
strong
men
like
these
that
the
bulwark
of
greatness
but
what
do
i
get
in
return
mister
peterson
i
come
up
here
as
a
gentleman
and
talk
to
you
i
treat
you
as
a
gentleman
i
overlook
what
you
showed
yourself
to
be
and
how
do
you
return
it
by
talking
like
the
blackguard
you
are
you
knock
an
innocent
cigar
your
time
up
said
pete
drawing
a
step
nearer
come
to
business
or
clear
out
that
all
i
got
to
say
to
you
all
right
peterson
right
i
put
up
with
your
insults
i
can
afford
to
forget
myself
when
i
look
about
me
at
the
heavier
burdens
these
men
have
to
bear
day
and
night
look
at
that
look
at
it
and
then
try
to
talk
to
me
he
pointed
back
toward
the
stairs
where
a
gang
of
eight
laborers
were
carrying
a
heavy
timber
across
the
shadowy
floor
well
what
about
it
said
pete
with
rage
what
about
it
but
never
mind
i
a
busy
man
myself
i
got
no
more
time
to
waste
on
the
likes
of
you
take
a
good
look
at
that
and
then
listen
to
me
that
the
last
stick
of
timber
that
goes
across
this
floor
until
you
put
a
runway
from
the
hoist
to
the
end
of
the
building
and
every
stick
that
leaves
the
runway
has
got
to
go
on
a
dolly
mark
my
words
now
i
talking
plain
my
men
do
lift
another
pound
of
timber
on
this
house
everything
goes
on
rollers
i
tried
to
be
a
patient
man
but
you
run
against
the
limit
you
broke
the
last
back
have
a
chance
at
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
as
if
to
shout
at
the
gang
but
dropped
it
and
faced
around
no
i
wo
stop
them
i
be
fair
to
the
last
he
pulled
out
his
watch
i
give
you
one
hour
from
now
at
ten
if
your
runway
and
the
dollies
ai
working
the
men
go
out
and
the
next
time
i
see
you
i
wo
be
so
easy
he
turned
away
waved
to
the
laborers
with
an
all
right
boys
go
ahead
and
walked
grandly
toward
the
stairway
max
whistled
i
like
to
know
where
charlie
is
said
peterson
he
ai
far
i
find
him
and
max
hurried
away
bannon
was
sitting
in
the
office
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
figuring
on
the
back
of
a
blotter
the
light
from
the
wall
lamp
was
indistinct
and
bannon
had
to
bend
his
head
forward
to
see
the
figures
he
did
not
look
up
when
the
door
opened
and
max
came
to
the
railing
gate
grady
been
up
on
the
distributing
floor
said
max
breathlessly
for
he
had
been
running
what
did
he
want
he
going
to
call
the
men
off
at
ten
if
we
do
put
in
a
runway
and
dollies
on
the
distributing
floor
bannon
looked
at
his
watch
is
that
all
he
wants
max
in
his
excitement
did
not
catch
the
sarcasm
in
the
question
that
all
he
said
but
it
enough
we
ca
do
it
bannon
closed
his
watch
with
a
snap
no
he
said
and
we
wo
throw
away
any
good
time
trying
better
round
up
the
committee
that
supposed
to
run
this
lodge
and
send
them
here
that
young
murphy
one
of
them
he
can
put
you
straight
bring
pete
back
with
you
and
the
new
man
james
max
lingered
with
a
look
of
awe
and
admiration
are
you
going
to
stand
out
mr
bannon
he
asked
bannon
dropped
his
feet
to
the
floor
and
turned
toward
the
table
yes
he
said
we
going
to
stand
out
since
bannon
talk
with
president
carver
a
little
drama
had
been
going
on
in
the
local
lodge
a
drama
that
neither
bannon
max
nor
peterson
knew
about
james
had
been
selected
by
carver
for
this
work
because
of
proved
ability
and
shrewdness
he
had
no
sooner
attached
himself
to
the
lodge
and
made
himself
known
as
an
active
member
than
his
personality
without
any
noticeable
effort
on
his
part
began
to
make
itself
felt
up
to
this
time
grady
had
had
full
swing
for
there
had
been
no
one
among
the
laborers
with
force
enough
to
oppose
him
the
first
collision
took
place
at
an
early
meeting
after
grady
last
talk
with
bannon
the
delegate
in
the
course
of
the
meeting
bitterly
attacked
bannon
accusing
him
at
the
climax
of
his
oration
of
an
attempt
to
buy
off
the
honest
representative
of
the
working
classes
for
five
thousand
dollars
this
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
excitable
minds
before
him
he
finished
his
speech
with
an
impassioned
tirade
against
the
corrupt
influences
of
the
money
power
and
was
mopping
his
flushed
face
listening
with
elation
to
the
hum
of
anger
that
resulted
confident
that
he
had
made
his
point
when
james
arose
the
new
man
was
as
familiar
with
the
tone
of
the
meetings
of
laborers
as
grady
himself
at
the
beginning
he
had
no
wish
further
than
to
get
at
the
truth
grady
had
not
stated
his
case
well
it
had
convinced
the
laborers
but
to
james
it
had
weak
points
he
asked
grady
a
few
pointed
questions
that
had
the
delegate
felt
the
truth
behind
him
should
not
have
been
hard
to
answer
but
grady
was
still
under
the
spell
of
his
own
oratory
and
in
attempting
to
get
his
feet
back
on
the
ground
he
bungled
james
did
not
carry
the
discussion
beyond
the
point
where
grady
in
the
bewilderment
of
recognizing
this
new
element
in
the
lodge
lost
his
temper
but
when
he
sat
down
the
sentiment
of
the
meeting
had
changed
few
of
those
men
could
have
explained
their
feelings
it
was
simply
that
the
new
man
was
stronger
than
they
were
perhaps
as
strong
as
grady
and
they
were
influenced
accordingly
there
was
no
decision
for
a
strike
at
that
meeting
grady
cunning
at
the
business
immediately
dropped
open
discussion
and
smarting
under
the
sense
of
lost
prestige
set
about
regaining
his
position
by
talk
with
individual
laborers
this
went
on
largely
without
james
knowledge
until
grady
felt
sure
that
a
majority
of
the
men
were
back
in
his
control
this
time
he
was
determined
to
carry
through
the
strike
without
the
preliminary
vote
of
the
men
it
was
a
bold
stroke
but
boldness
was
needed
to
defeat
charlie
bannon
and
nobody
knew
better
than
grady
that
a
dashing
show
of
authority
would
be
hard
for
james
or
any
one
else
to
resist
and
so
he
had
come
on
the
job
this
evening
at
a
time
when
he
supposed
bannon
safe
in
bed
and
delivered
his
ultimatum
not
that
he
had
any
hope
of
carrying
the
strike
through
without
some
sort
of
a
collision
with
the
boss
but
he
well
knew
that
an
encounter
after
the
strike
had
gathered
momentum
would
be
easier
than
one
before
bannon
might
be
able
to
outwit
an
individual
even
grady
himself
but
he
would
find
it
hard
to
make
headway
against
an
angry
mob
and
now
grady
was
pacing
stiffly
about
the
belt
line
yards
while
the
minute
hand
of
his
watch
crept
around
toward
ten
even
if
bannon
should
be
called
within
the
hour
a
few
fiery
words
to
those
sweating
gangs
on
the
distributing
floor
should
carry
the
day
but
grady
did
not
think
that
this
would
be
necessary
he
was
still
in
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
peterson
and
the
boss
were
at
outs
and
he
had
arrived
by
a
sort
of
reasoning
that
seemed
the
keenest
strategy
at
the
conclusion
that
peterson
would
take
the
opportunity
to
settle
the
matter
himself
in
fact
grady
had
evolved
a
neat
little
campaign
and
he
was
proud
of
himself
bannon
did
not
have
to
wait
long
soon
there
was
a
sound
of
feet
outside
the
door
and
after
a
little
hesitation
six
laborers
entered
five
of
them
awkwardly
and
timidly
wondering
what
was
to
come
peterson
followed
with
max
and
closed
the
door
the
members
of
the
committee
stood
in
a
straggling
row
at
the
railing
looking
at
each
other
and
at
the
floor
and
ceiling
anywhere
but
at
the
boss
who
was
sitting
on
the
table
sternly
taking
them
in
james
stepped
to
one
side
is
this
all
the
committee
bannon
presently
said
the
men
hesitated
and
murphy
who
was
in
the
centre
answered
yes
sir
you
are
the
governing
members
of
your
lodge
there
was
an
air
of
cool
authority
about
bannon
that
disturbed
the
men
they
had
been
led
to
believe
that
his
power
reached
only
the
work
on
the
elevator
and
that
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
their
organization
would
be
an
act
of
tyranny
to
be
resisted
to
the
death
grady
words
but
these
men
standing
before
their
boss
in
his
own
office
were
not
the
same
men
that
thrilled
with
righteous
wrath
under
grady
eloquence
in
the
meetings
over
saloon
so
they
looked
at
the
floor
and
ceiling
again
until
murphy
at
last
answered
yes
sir
bannon
waited
again
knowing
that
every
added
moment
of
silence
gave
him
the
firmer
control
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
the
government
of
your
organization
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
coldly
i
have
brought
you
here
to
ask
you
this
question
have
you
voted
to
strike
the
silence
was
deep
peterson
leaning
against
the
closed
door
held
his
breath
max
sitting
on
the
railing
with
his
elbow
thrown
over
the
desk
leaned
slightly
forward
the
eyes
of
the
laborers
wandered
restlessly
about
the
room
they
were
disturbed
taken
off
their
guard
they
needed
grady
but
the
thought
of
grady
was
followed
by
the
consciousness
of
the
silent
figure
of
the
new
man
james
standing
behind
them
murphy
first
impulse
was
to
lie
perhaps
if
james
had
not
been
there
he
would
have
lied
as
it
was
he
glanced
up
two
or
three
times
and
his
lips
as
many
times
framed
themselves
about
words
that
did
not
come
finally
he
said
mumbling
the
words
no
we
ai
voted
for
no
strike
there
has
been
no
such
decision
made
by
your
organization
no
i
guess
not
bannon
turned
to
peterson
peterson
will
you
please
find
grady
and
bring
him
here
max
and
peterson
hurried
out
together
bannon
drew
up
the
chair
and
turned
his
back
on
the
committee
going
on
with
his
figuring
not
a
word
was
said
the
men
hardly
moved
and
the
minutes
went
slowly
by
then
there
was
a
stir
outside
and
the
sound
of
low
voices
the
door
flew
open
admitting
grady
who
stalked
to
the
railing
choking
with
anger
max
who
immediately
followed
was
grinning
his
eyes
resting
on
a
round
spot
of
dust
on
grady
shoulder
and
on
his
torn
collar
and
disarranged
tie
peterson
came
in
last
and
carefully
closed
the
door
his
eyes
were
blazing
and
one
sleeve
was
rolled
up
over
his
bare
forearm
neither
of
them
spoke
if
anything
in
the
nature
of
an
assault
had
seemed
necessary
in
dragging
the
delegate
to
the
office
there
had
been
no
witnesses
and
he
had
entered
the
room
of
his
own
accord
grady
was
at
a
disadvantage
and
he
knew
it
breathing
hard
his
face
red
his
little
eyes
darting
about
the
room
he
took
it
all
in
the
members
of
the
committee
the
boss
figuring
at
the
table
with
an
air
of
exasperating
coolness
about
his
lean
back
and
last
of
all
james
standing
in
the
shadow
it
was
the
sight
of
the
new
man
that
checked
the
storm
of
words
that
was
pressing
on
grady
tongue
but
he
finally
gathered
himself
and
stepped
forward
pushing
aside
one
of
the
committee
then
bannon
turned
he
faced
about
in
his
chair
and
began
to
talk
straight
at
the
committee
ignoring
the
delegate
grady
began
to
talk
at
the
same
time
but
though
his
voice
was
the
louder
no
one
seemed
to
hear
him
the
men
were
looking
at
bannon
grady
hesitated
started
again
and
then
bound
by
his
own
rage
and
his
sense
of
defeat
let
his
words
die
away
and
stood
casting
about
for
an
this
man
grady
threatened
a
good
while
ago
that
i
would
have
a
strike
on
my
hands
he
finally
came
to
me
and
offered
to
protect
me
if
i
would
pay
him
five
thousand
dollars
that
a
lie
shouted
the
delegate
he
come
to
me
bannon
had
hardly
paused
he
drew
a
typewritten
copy
of
grady
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
aloud
then
handed
it
over
to
murphy
that
the
way
he
came
at
me
i
want
you
to
read
it
the
man
took
it
awkwardly
glanced
at
it
and
passed
it
on
he
ordered
a
strike
he
calls
himself
your
representative
but
he
has
acted
on
his
own
responsibility
now
i
am
going
to
talk
plain
to
you
i
came
here
to
build
this
elevator
and
i
going
to
do
it
i
propose
to
treat
you
men
fair
and
square
if
you
think
you
treated
right
you
send
an
honest
man
to
this
office
and
i
talk
with
him
but
i
through
with
grady
i
wo
have
him
here
at
all
if
you
send
him
around
again
i
throw
him
off
the
job
the
men
were
a
little
startled
they
looked
at
one
another
and
the
man
on
murphy
left
whispered
something
bannon
sat
still
watching
them
then
grady
came
to
himself
he
wheeled
around
to
face
the
committee
and
threw
out
one
arm
in
a
wide
gesture
i
demand
to
know
what
this
means
i
demand
to
know
if
there
is
a
law
in
this
land
is
an
honest
man
the
representative
of
the
hand
of
labor
to
be
attacked
by
hired
ruffians
is
he
to
be
slandered
by
the
tyrant
who
drives
you
at
the
point
of
the
pistol
and
you
not
men
enough
to
defend
your
rights
the
rights
held
by
every
american
the
rights
granted
by
the
constitution
but
it
ai
for
myself
i
would
talk
it
ai
my
own
injuries
that
i
suffer
for
your
liberty
hangs
in
the
balance
this
man
has
dared
to
interfere
in
the
integrity
of
your
lodge
have
you
no
words
bannon
arose
caught
grady
arm
and
whirled
him
around
grady
he
said
shut
up
the
delegate
tried
to
jerk
away
but
he
could
not
shake
off
that
grip
he
looked
toward
the
committeemen
but
they
were
silent
he
looked
everywhere
but
up
into
the
eyes
that
were
blazing
down
at
him
and
finally
bannon
felt
the
muscles
within
his
grip
relax
i
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
said
bannon
to
the
committeemen
i
want
you
to
elect
a
new
delegate
do
talk
about
interference
i
do
care
how
you
elect
him
or
who
he
is
if
he
comes
to
me
squarely
grady
was
wriggling
again
this
means
a
strike
he
shouted
this
means
the
biggest
strike
the
west
has
ever
seen
you
wo
get
men
for
love
or
money
bannon
gave
the
arm
a
wrench
and
broke
in
i
sick
of
this
i
laid
this
matter
before
president
carver
i
have
his
word
that
if
you
hang
on
to
this
man
after
he
been
proved
a
blackmailer
your
lodge
can
be
dropped
from
the
federation
if
you
try
to
strike
you
wo
hurt
anybody
but
yourselves
that
all
you
can
go
wait
grady
began
but
they
filed
out
without
looking
at
him
james
as
he
followed
them
nodded
and
said
good
night
mr
bannon
then
for
the
last
time
bannon
led
grady
away
peterson
started
forward
but
the
boss
shook
his
head
and
went
out
marching
the
delegate
between
the
lumber
piles
to
the
point
where
the
path
crossed
the
belt
line
tracks
now
grady
he
said
this
is
where
our
ground
stops
the
other
sides
are
the
road
there
and
the
river
and
the
last
piles
of
cribbing
at
the
other
end
i
telling
you
so
you
will
know
where
you
belong
now
get
out
chapter
xiv
the
effect
of
the
victory
was
felt
everywhere
not
only
were
max
and
pete
and
hilda
jubilant
over
it
but
the
the
timekeepers
even
the
laborers
attacked
their
work
with
a
fresher
energy
it
was
like
the
first
whiff
of
salt
air
to
an
army
marching
to
the
sea
since
the
day
when
the
cribbing
came
down
from
ledyard
the
work
had
gone
forward
with
almost
incredible
rapidity
there
had
been
no
faltering
during
the
weeks
when
grady
threatened
catastrophe
was
imminent
but
now
that
the
big
shadow
of
the
little
delegate
was
dispelled
it
was
easier
to
see
that
the
huge
warehouse
was
almost
finished
there
was
still
much
to
do
and
the
handful
of
days
that
remained
seemed
absurdly
inadequate
but
it
needed
only
a
glance
at
what
charlie
bannon
tireless
driving
energy
had
already
accomplished
to
make
the
rest
look
easy
we
sure
of
it
now
she
be
full
to
the
roof
before
the
year
is
out
as
max
went
over
the
job
with
his
next
morning
he
said
it
to
every
man
he
met
and
they
all
believed
him
peterson
the
same
man
and
not
the
same
man
either
who
had
once
vowed
that
there
would
be
any
night
work
on
calumet
k
who
had
bent
a
pair
of
most
unwilling
shoulders
to
the
work
bannon
had
put
upon
them
who
had
once
spent
long
sulky
afternoons
in
the
barren
little
room
of
his
new
peterson
held
himself
down
in
bed
exactly
three
hours
the
morning
after
that
famous
victory
before
eleven
he
was
sledging
down
a
tottering
timber
at
the
summit
of
the
marine
tower
a
hundred
and
forty
feet
sheer
above
the
wharf
just
before
noon
he
came
into
the
office
and
found
hilda
there
alone
he
had
stopped
outside
the
door
to
put
on
his
coat
but
had
not
buttoned
it
his
shirt
wet
as
though
he
had
been
in
the
lake
clung
to
him
and
revealed
the
outline
of
every
muscle
in
his
great
trunk
he
flung
his
hat
on
the
and
his
yellow
hair
seemed
crisper
and
curlier
than
ever
before
well
it
looks
as
though
we
was
all
right
he
said
hilda
nodded
emphatically
you
think
we
get
through
in
time
you
mr
peterson
think
he
exclaimed
i
do
have
to
stop
to
think
here
comes
max
just
ask
him
max
slammed
the
door
behind
him
brought
down
the
timekeeper
book
on
hilda
desk
with
a
slap
that
made
her
jump
and
vaulted
to
a
seat
on
the
railing
well
i
guess
it
a
case
of
hurrah
for
us
ai
it
pete
your
sister
asked
me
if
i
thought
we
get
done
on
time
i
was
just
saying
it
a
sure
thing
i
do
know
said
max
laughing
i
guess
an
earthquake
could
stop
us
but
why
ai
you
abed
pete
what
do
i
want
to
be
abed
for
i
ai
going
to
sleep
any
more
this
year
unless
we
get
through
a
day
or
two
ahead
of
time
i
do
like
to
miss
any
of
it
charlie
bannon
may
have
hustled
before
but
i
guess
this
breaks
his
record
where
is
he
now
max
down
in
the
cellar
putting
in
the
running
gear
for
the
conveyors
he
has
his
nerve
with
him
he
putting
in
three
drives
entirely
different
from
the
way
they
are
in
the
plans
he
told
me
just
now
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
office
who
could
design
a
drive
that
would
tie
itself
up
in
square
knots
in
the
first
ten
minutes
i
wonder
what
old
macbride
say
when
he
sees
that
he
changed
the
plans
if
macbride
has
good
sense
he
pass
anything
that
charlie
puts
up
said
pete
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
just
then
bannon
strode
into
the
office
and
over
to
the
draughting
table
he
tossed
pete
hat
to
one
side
and
began
studying
a
detail
of
the
machinery
plans
max
he
spoke
without
looking
up
i
wish
you
find
a
water
boy
and
send
him
up
to
the
hotel
to
get
a
couple
of
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
of
coffee
well
that
a
nice
way
to
celebrate
i
must
say
pete
commented
celebrate
what
why
last
night
throwing
grady
down
you
ought
to
take
a
day
off
on
the
strength
of
that
what
grady
got
to
do
with
it
he
ai
in
the
specifications
no
said
pete
slowly
but
where
would
we
have
been
if
he
got
the
men
off
where
would
we
have
been
if
the
house
had
burned
up
bannon
retorted
turning
away
from
the
table
that
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
have
felt
less
like
taking
a
day
off
since
i
came
on
the
job
we
may
get
through
on
time
and
we
may
not
if
we
get
tangled
up
in
the
plans
like
this
very
often
i
do
know
how
we
come
out
but
the
surest
way
to
get
left
is
to
begin
now
telling
ourselves
that
this
is
easy
and
it
a
cinch
that
kind
of
talk
makes
me
tired
pete
flushed
started
an
explanatory
sentence
and
another
and
then
very
uncomfortable
went
out
bannon
did
not
look
up
he
went
on
studying
the
blue
print
measuring
here
and
there
with
his
ruler
and
jotting
down
incomprehensible
operations
in
arithmetic
on
a
scrap
of
paper
max
was
figuring
tables
in
his
hilda
poring
over
the
cash
account
for
half
an
hour
no
one
spoke
max
crammed
his
cap
down
over
his
ears
and
went
out
and
there
were
ten
minutes
more
of
silence
then
bannon
began
talking
he
still
busied
his
fingers
with
the
blue
print
and
hilda
after
discovering
that
he
was
talking
to
himself
rather
than
to
her
went
on
with
her
work
but
nevertheless
she
heard
in
a
fragmentary
way
what
he
was
saying
take
a
day
off
schoolboy
trick
enough
to
make
a
man
tired
might
as
well
do
it
though
we
ai
going
to
get
through
the
office
ought
to
do
a
little
work
once
in
a
while
just
to
see
what
it
like
they
think
a
man
can
do
anything
i
like
to
know
why
i
ai
entitled
to
a
night
sleep
as
well
as
macbride
but
he
do
think
so
after
worked
me
hours
a
day
up
to
duluth
and
i
lost
pounds
up
there
he
sends
me
down
to
a
mess
like
this
with
a
lot
of
drawings
that
look
as
though
they
were
made
by
a
college
boy
where
does
he
expect
to
pile
their
car
doors
i
like
to
know
that
was
the
vein
of
it
though
the
monologue
ran
on
much
longer
but
at
last
he
swung
impatiently
around
and
addressed
hilda
i
ready
to
throw
up
my
hands
i
think
i
go
back
to
minneapolis
and
tell
macbride
i
had
enough
he
can
come
down
here
and
finish
the
house
himself
do
you
think
he
would
get
it
done
in
time
hilda
eyes
were
laughing
at
him
but
she
kept
them
on
her
work
oh
yes
he
said
wearily
he
get
the
grain
into
her
somehow
you
could
stump
macbride
with
anything
that
why
he
makes
it
so
warm
for
us
do
you
think
she
asked
very
demurely
indeed
that
if
macbride
had
been
here
he
could
have
built
it
any
faster
than
than
we
have
so
far
i
do
believe
it
said
bannon
unwarily
her
smile
told
him
that
he
had
been
trapped
i
see
he
added
you
mean
that
there
ai
any
reason
why
we
ca
do
it
he
arose
and
tramped
uneasily
about
the
little
shanty
oh
of
course
we
get
it
done
just
because
we
have
to
there
ai
anything
else
we
can
do
but
just
the
same
i
sick
of
the
business
i
want
to
quit
she
said
nothing
and
after
a
moment
he
wheeled
and
facing
her
demanded
abruptly
what
the
matter
with
me
anyway
she
looked
at
him
frankly
a
smile
almost
mischievous
in
her
face
the
hard
harassed
look
between
his
eyes
and
about
his
drawn
mouth
melted
away
and
he
repeated
the
question
what
the
matter
with
me
you
the
doctor
i
take
whatever
medicine
you
say
you
did
take
peterson
suggestion
very
well
about
taking
a
holiday
i
mean
i
do
know
whether
i
dare
prescribe
for
you
or
not
i
do
think
you
need
a
day
off
i
think
that
next
to
a
good
long
vacation
the
best
thing
for
you
is
excitement
he
laughed
no
i
mean
it
you
tired
out
of
course
but
if
you
have
enough
to
occupy
your
mind
you
do
know
it
the
trouble
is
that
everything
is
going
too
smoothly
you
were
a
bit
afraid
yesterday
that
the
elevator
would
be
done
on
time
that
was
because
you
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
strike
and
if
just
now
the
elevator
should
catch
on
fire
or
anything
you
feel
all
right
about
it
again
he
still
half
suspected
that
she
was
making
game
of
him
and
he
looked
at
her
steadily
while
he
turned
her
words
over
in
his
mind
well
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
if
the
only
medicine
i
need
is
excitement
i
be
the
healthiest
man
you
ever
saw
in
a
little
while
i
guess
find
pete
i
must
have
made
him
feel
pretty
sore
pete
he
said
coming
upon
him
in
the
marine
tower
a
little
later
i
got
over
my
is
it
all
right
sure
said
pete
i
did
know
you
was
feeling
bad
i
was
thinking
about
that
belt
gallery
charlie
ai
it
time
we
was
putting
it
up
i
getting
sort
of
nervous
about
it
there
ai
three
days
work
in
it
the
way
we
going
said
bannon
thoughtfully
his
eyes
on
the
that
lay
between
him
and
the
main
house
but
i
guess
you
right
we
get
at
it
now
there
no
telling
what
sort
of
a
surprise
party
those
railroad
fellows
may
have
for
us
the
plans
call
for
three
trestles
between
the
tracks
we
get
those
up
to
pete
building
the
gallery
was
a
more
serious
business
he
had
not
bannon
years
of
experience
at
bridge
repairing
it
had
happened
that
he
had
never
been
called
upon
to
put
up
a
belt
gallery
before
and
this
idea
of
building
a
wooden
box
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
holding
it
up
thirty
feet
in
air
on
three
trestles
was
formidable
bannon
nonchalant
air
of
setting
about
it
seemed
almost
an
affectation
each
trestle
was
to
consist
of
a
rank
of
four
posts
planted
in
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
of
the
gallery
they
were
to
be
held
together
at
the
top
by
a
corbel
no
one
gave
rush
orders
any
more
on
calumet
k
for
the
reason
that
no
one
ever
thought
of
doing
anything
else
if
bannon
sent
for
a
man
he
came
on
the
run
so
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
fences
were
down
and
a
swarm
of
men
with
spades
post
augers
picks
and
shovels
had
invaded
the
up
and
down
the
track
a
hundred
yards
each
way
from
the
line
of
the
gallery
bannon
had
stationed
men
to
give
warning
of
the
approach
of
trains
now
said
bannon
we
get
this
part
of
the
job
done
before
any
one
has
time
to
kick
and
they
wo
be
very
likely
to
try
to
pull
up
by
the
roots
once
we
get
planted
but
the
section
boss
had
received
instructions
that
caused
him
to
be
day
or
night
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
neighborhood
of
calumet
half
an
hour
after
the
work
was
begun
the
picket
line
up
the
track
signalled
that
something
was
coming
there
was
no
sound
of
bell
or
whistle
but
presently
bannon
saw
a
hand
car
spinning
down
the
track
as
fast
as
six
big
sweating
men
could
pump
the
levers
the
section
boss
had
little
to
say
simply
that
they
were
to
get
out
of
there
and
put
up
that
fence
again
and
the
quicker
the
better
bannon
tried
to
tell
him
that
the
railroad
had
consented
to
their
putting
in
the
gallery
that
they
were
well
within
their
rights
that
he
the
section
boss
had
better
be
careful
not
to
exceed
his
instructions
but
the
section
boss
had
spoken
his
whole
mind
already
he
was
not
of
the
sort
that
talk
just
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
their
own
voices
and
he
had
categorical
instructions
that
made
parley
unnecessary
he
would
not
even
tell
from
whom
he
had
the
orders
so
the
posts
were
lugged
out
of
the
way
and
the
fence
was
put
up
and
the
men
scattered
out
to
their
former
work
again
grinning
a
little
over
bannon
discomfiture
bannon
next
move
was
to
write
to
minneapolis
for
information
and
instructions
but
macbride
who
seemed
to
have
all
the
information
there
was
happened
to
be
in
duluth
and
brown
instructions
were
consequently
foggy
so
after
waiting
a
few
days
for
something
more
definite
bannon
disappeared
one
afternoon
and
was
gone
more
than
an
hour
when
he
strode
into
the
office
again
keen
and
springy
as
though
his
work
had
just
begun
hilda
looked
up
and
smiled
a
little
pete
was
tilted
back
in
the
chair
staring
glumly
out
of
the
window
he
did
not
turn
until
bannon
slapped
him
jovially
on
the
shoulders
and
told
him
to
cheer
up
those
railroad
chaps
are
laying
for
us
sure
enough
he
said
been
talking
to
macbride
himself
over
at
the
telephone
exchange
he
ai
in
town
and
he
said
that
porter
he
the
of
the
porter
told
him
when
he
was
in
chicago
that
they
object
at
all
to
our
building
the
gallery
over
their
tracks
but
all
we
got
to
go
by
not
a
word
on
paper
oh
they
mean
to
give
us
a
picnic
and
no
mistake
with
that
bannon
called
up
the
general
offices
of
the
and
asked
for
porter
there
was
some
little
delay
in
getting
the
connection
and
then
three
or
four
minutes
of
fencing
while
a
young
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
tried
to
satisfy
himself
that
bannon
had
the
right
to
ask
for
porter
let
alone
to
talk
with
him
and
bannon
steadily
ignoring
his
questions
continued
blandly
requesting
him
to
call
porter
to
the
telephone
hilda
was
listening
with
interest
for
bannon
manner
was
different
from
anything
she
had
ever
seen
in
him
before
it
lacked
nothing
of
his
customary
assurance
but
its
breeziness
gave
place
to
the
most
studied
restraint
he
might
have
been
a
railroad
president
himself
he
hung
up
the
receiver
however
without
accomplishing
anything
for
the
young
man
finally
told
him
that
porter
had
gone
out
for
the
afternoon
so
next
morning
bannon
tried
again
he
learned
that
porter
was
in
and
all
seemed
to
be
going
well
until
he
mentioned
macbride
company
after
which
porter
became
very
elusive
three
or
four
attempts
to
pin
him
down
or
at
least
to
learn
his
whereabouts
proved
unsuccessful
and
at
last
bannon
with
wrath
in
his
heart
started
down
town
it
was
nearly
night
before
he
came
back
and
as
before
he
found
pete
sitting
gloomily
in
the
office
waiting
his
return
well
exclaimed
the
night
boss
looking
at
him
eagerly
i
thought
you
was
never
coming
back
we
most
had
a
fit
here
wondering
how
you
come
out
i
have
to
ask
you
though
i
can
see
by
your
looks
that
we
all
right
bannon
laughed
and
glanced
over
at
hilda
who
was
watching
him
closely
is
that
your
guess
too
miss
vogel
i
do
think
so
she
said
i
think
you
had
a
pretty
hard
time
they
both
good
guesses
he
said
pulling
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
hilda
read
that
it
was
a
formal
permit
for
building
the
gallery
signed
by
porter
himself
and
bearing
the
of
the
general
manager
nice
is
it
bannon
commented
now
read
the
postscript
miss
vogel
it
was
in
porter
handwriting
and
hilda
read
it
slowly
macbride
company
are
not
however
allowed
to
erect
trestles
or
temporary
scaffolding
in
the
nor
to
remove
any
property
of
the
company
such
as
fences
nor
to
do
anything
which
may
in
the
opinion
of
the
local
authorities
hinder
the
movement
of
trains
pete
face
went
blank
a
lot
of
good
this
darned
permit
does
us
then
that
just
means
we
ca
build
it
bannon
nodded
that
what
it
supposed
to
mean
he
said
just
the
point
you
see
it
like
this
he
went
on
that
man
porter
would
make
the
finest
material
for
dust
proof
bearings
that
i
ever
saw
he
just
about
the
hardest
smoothest
shiniest
coolest
little
piece
of
metal
that
ever
came
my
way
well
he
wants
to
delay
us
on
this
job
i
took
that
in
the
moment
i
saw
him
well
i
told
him
how
we
went
ahead
just
banking
on
his
verbal
consent
and
how
his
railroad
had
jumped
on
us
and
i
said
i
was
sure
it
was
just
a
misunderstanding
but
i
wanted
it
cleared
up
because
we
was
in
a
hurry
he
grinned
a
little
over
that
and
i
went
on
talking
said
we
bother
as
little
as
possible
of
course
we
had
to
put
up
the
trestles
in
their
property
because
we
could
hold
the
thing
up
with
a
balloon
he
asked
me
innocent
as
you
please
if
a
steel
bridge
could
be
made
in
a
single
span
and
i
said
yes
but
it
would
take
too
long
we
only
had
a
few
days
he
says
bannon
i
give
you
a
permit
and
that
what
he
gave
me
i
bet
he
grinning
yet
i
wonder
if
grin
so
much
about
three
days
from
now
do
you
mean
that
you
can
build
it
anyway
hilda
demanded
breathlessly
he
nodded
and
turning
to
pete
plunged
into
a
swift
technical
explanation
of
how
the
trick
was
to
be
done
wo
you
please
tell
me
too
hilda
asked
appealingly
sure
he
said
he
sat
down
beside
her
at
the
desk
and
began
drawing
on
a
piece
of
paper
pete
came
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
bannon
began
his
explanation
illustration
here
the
spouting
house
here
the
spouting
house
and
here
the
elevator
now
suppose
they
were
only
fifteen
feet
apart
then
if
we
had
two
sticks
and
put
up
at
an
angle
and
fastened
the
floor
to
a
bolt
that
came
down
between
the
whole
weight
of
the
thing
would
be
passed
along
to
the
foundation
that
the
ends
of
the
timbers
rest
on
but
you
see
it
got
to
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
to
build
it
that
way
would
take
two
one
timbers
and
we
have
got
that
long
illustration
he
was
drawing
lines
across
the
timber
but
we
got
plenty
of
sticks
that
are
twenty
feet
long
and
plenty
of
bolts
and
this
is
the
way
we
arrange
we
put
up
our
first
stick
at
an
angle
just
as
before
then
we
let
a
bolt
down
through
the
upper
end
of
it
and
through
the
floor
of
the
gallery
now
the
next
timber
we
put
up
at
just
the
same
angle
as
the
first
with
the
foot
of
it
bearing
down
on
the
lower
end
of
the
bolt
that
second
stick
pushes
two
ways
a
straight
down
push
and
a
sideways
push
the
bolt
resists
the
down
push
and
transmits
it
to
the
first
stick
and
that
pushes
against
the
sill
that
i
marked
now
the
sideways
push
is
against
the
butt
of
the
first
timber
of
the
floor
and
that
passed
on
same
way
to
the
sill
well
that
the
whole
trick
you
begin
at
both
ends
at
once
and
just
keep
right
on
going
when
the
thing
done
it
looks
this
way
you
see
where
the
two
sections
meet
in
the
middle
it
just
the
same
as
the
little
gallery
that
we
made
a
picture
of
up
here
illustration
well
that
the
whole
trick
i
understand
that
all
right
said
pete
but
i
do
see
yet
how
you
going
to
do
it
without
some
kind
of
scaffolding
easy
i
ai
going
to
use
a
balloon
but
i
got
something
better
it
be
out
here
this
afternoon
come
and
help
me
get
things
ready
there
was
not
much
to
do
for
the
timber
was
already
cut
to
the
right
sizes
but
bannon
was
not
content
till
everything
was
piled
so
that
when
work
did
begin
on
the
gallery
it
could
go
without
a
hitch
he
was
already
several
days
behind
and
when
one
is
figuring
it
as
fine
as
bannon
was
doing
in
those
last
days
even
one
day
is
a
serious
matter
he
could
do
nothing
more
at
the
belt
gallery
until
his
substitute
for
a
scaffold
should
arrive
it
did
not
come
that
afternoon
or
evening
and
next
morning
when
he
came
on
the
job
it
still
had
not
been
heard
from
there
was
enough
to
occupy
every
moment
of
his
time
and
every
shred
of
his
thought
without
bothering
about
the
gallery
and
he
did
not
worry
about
it
as
he
would
have
worried
if
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
it
but
when
well
along
in
the
afternoon
a
water
boy
found
him
up
on
the
weighing
floor
and
told
him
there
was
something
for
him
at
the
office
he
made
astonishing
time
getting
down
here
your
package
said
max
as
bannon
burst
into
the
little
shanty
it
was
a
little
round
pasteboard
box
if
bannon
had
had
the
office
to
himself
he
would
in
his
disappointment
have
cursed
the
thing
till
it
took
fire
as
it
was
he
stood
speechless
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
go
out
again
are
you
going
to
open
it
now
you
here
asked
max
bannon
after
hesitating
acted
on
the
suggestion
and
when
he
saw
what
it
was
he
laughed
no
brown
had
not
forgotten
the
hat
max
gazed
at
it
in
unfeigned
awe
it
was
shiny
as
a
mirror
black
as
a
hearse
tall
in
his
eyes
for
this
was
his
first
near
view
of
one
as
the
seat
of
a
chair
put
it
on
he
said
to
bannon
let
see
how
it
looks
on
you
not
much
would
i
look
silly
in
a
thing
like
that
though
rather
wear
an
ordinary
length
of
stovepipe
that
be
durable
anyway
i
wonder
what
brown
sent
it
for
i
thought
he
knew
a
joke
when
he
saw
one
just
then
one
of
the
came
in
oh
bannon
he
said
i
been
looking
for
you
there
a
tug
in
the
river
with
a
big
steel
cable
aboard
that
they
said
was
for
us
i
told
i
thought
it
was
a
mistake
it
was
all
one
movement
bannon
jamming
that
hat
the
silk
hat
down
on
his
head
and
diving
through
the
door
he
shouted
orders
as
he
ran
and
a
number
of
men
pete
among
them
got
to
the
wharf
as
soon
as
he
did
now
boys
this
is
all
the
false
work
we
can
have
we
going
to
hang
it
up
across
the
tracks
and
hang
our
gallery
up
on
it
till
it
strong
enough
to
hold
itself
we
got
just
hours
to
do
the
whole
trick
catch
hold
now
lively
illustration
it
was
a
simple
scheme
it
was
a
simple
scheme
of
bannon
the
floor
of
the
gallery
was
to
be
built
in
two
sections
one
in
the
main
house
one
in
the
spouting
house
as
fast
as
the
timbers
were
bolted
together
the
halves
of
the
floor
were
shoved
out
over
the
tracks
each
free
end
being
supported
by
a
rope
which
ran
up
over
a
pulley
the
pulley
was
held
by
an
iron
ring
fast
to
the
cable
but
perfectly
free
to
slide
along
it
and
thus
accompany
the
end
of
the
floor
as
it
was
moved
outward
bannon
explained
it
to
pete
in
a
few
quick
words
while
the
men
were
hustling
the
big
cable
off
the
tug
of
course
he
was
concluding
the
thing
wabble
a
good
deal
specially
if
it
as
windy
as
this
and
it
wo
be
easy
to
work
on
but
it
wo
fall
if
we
make
everything
fast
pete
had
listened
pretty
closely
at
first
but
now
bannon
noticed
that
his
attention
seemed
to
be
wandering
to
a
point
a
few
inches
above
bannon
head
he
was
about
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
when
he
found
out
it
was
windier
on
that
particular
wharf
than
anywhere
else
in
the
calumet
flats
and
the
hat
he
had
on
was
not
built
for
that
sort
of
weather
it
was
perfectly
rigid
and
not
at
all
accommodated
to
the
shape
of
bannon
head
so
very
naturally
it
blew
off
rolled
around
among
their
feet
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
into
the
river
between
the
wharf
and
the
tug
bannon
was
up
on
the
spouting
house
helping
make
fast
the
cable
end
when
a
workman
brought
the
hat
back
to
him
somebody
on
the
tug
had
fished
it
out
with
a
trolling
line
but
the
hat
was
well
past
resuscitation
it
had
been
thoroughly
drowned
and
it
seemed
to
know
it
take
that
to
the
office
said
bannon
have
vogel
wrap
it
up
just
as
it
is
and
ship
it
to
brown
i
dictate
a
letter
to
go
with
it
by
and
by
for
all
bannon
foresight
there
threatened
to
be
a
hitch
in
the
work
on
the
gallery
the
day
shift
was
on
again
and
of
hours
were
spent
when
he
happened
to
say
to
a
man
never
mind
that
now
but
be
sure
you
fix
it
the
man
repeated
we
ai
going
to
work
are
we
bannon
noticed
that
every
man
within
hearing
stopped
work
waiting
for
the
answer
sure
he
said
why
not
there
was
some
dissatisfied
grumbling
among
them
which
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
until
he
caught
the
word
christmas
christmas
he
exclaimed
in
perfectly
honest
astonishment
is
christmas
he
ran
his
hand
through
his
stubby
hair
boys
he
said
i
sorry
to
have
to
ask
it
of
you
but
ca
we
put
it
off
a
week
look
here
we
need
this
day
now
if
you
say
christmas
is
a
week
from
i
give
every
man
on
the
job
a
christmas
dinner
that
you
never
forget
all
you
can
eat
and
as
much
again
and
you
bring
your
friends
if
we
work
and
we
have
her
full
of
wheat
a
week
from
does
that
go
it
went
with
a
ripping
cheer
to
boot
a
cheer
that
was
repeated
here
and
there
all
over
the
place
as
bannon
offer
was
passed
along
so
for
another
hours
they
strained
and
tugged
and
tusselled
up
in
the
big
swing
for
it
was
nothing
else
above
the
railroad
tracks
there
was
a
northeast
gale
raging
down
off
the
lake
with
squalls
of
rain
and
sleet
mixed
up
in
it
and
it
took
the
crazy
swaying
box
in
its
teeth
and
shook
it
and
tossed
it
up
in
the
air
in
its
eagerness
to
strip
it
off
the
cable
but
somewhere
there
was
an
unconquerable
tenacity
that
held
fast
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
the
long
box
grew
rigid
as
the
trusses
were
pounded
into
place
by
men
so
spent
with
fatigue
that
one
might
say
it
was
sheer
good
will
that
drove
the
hammers
at
four
christmas
afternoon
the
last
bolt
was
drawn
taut
the
gallery
was
done
bannon
had
been
on
the
work
since
midnight
sixteen
consecutive
hours
he
had
eaten
nothing
except
two
sandwiches
that
he
had
stowed
in
his
pockets
his
only
pause
had
been
about
nine
that
morning
when
he
had
put
his
head
in
the
office
door
to
wish
hilda
a
merry
christmas
when
the
evening
shift
came
on
that
was
just
after
four
one
of
the
tried
to
get
him
to
talking
but
bannon
was
too
tired
to
talk
get
your
tracks
and
rollers
in
he
said
take
down
the
cable
do
you
want
to
stay
and
see
if
she
hold
when
the
cable
comes
down
called
the
foreman
after
him
as
he
started
away
she
hold
said
bannon
chapter
xv
before
december
was
half
gone
and
while
the
mild
autumn
weather
serenely
held
in
spite
of
weather
predictions
and
of
storm
signs
about
the
sun
and
days
of
blue
haze
and
motionless
trees
the
public
knew
all
the
outside
facts
about
the
fight
in
wheat
and
they
knew
it
to
be
the
biggest
fight
since
the
days
of
old
hutch
and
the
record
indeed
there
were
men
who
predicted
that
the
mark
would
be
reached
before
christmas
for
the
clique
of
speculators
who
held
the
floor
were
buying
buying
buying
millions
upon
millions
of
dollars
were
slipping
through
their
ready
hands
and
still
there
was
no
hesitation
no
weakening
until
the
small
fry
had
dropped
out
the
deal
had
been
confused
it
was
too
big
there
were
too
many
interests
involved
to
make
possible
a
clear
understanding
but
now
it
was
settling
down
into
a
grim
fight
between
the
biggest
men
on
the
board
the
clique
were
buying
wheat
page
company
were
selling
it
to
them
if
it
should
come
out
on
the
of
december
that
page
company
had
sold
more
than
they
could
deliver
the
clique
would
be
winners
but
if
it
should
have
been
delivered
to
the
last
bushel
the
corner
would
be
broken
and
the
clique
would
drop
from
sight
as
so
many
reckless
men
had
dropped
before
the
readers
of
every
great
newspaper
in
the
country
were
watching
page
company
the
general
opinion
was
that
they
could
not
do
it
that
such
an
enormous
quantity
of
grain
could
not
be
delivered
and
registered
in
time
even
if
it
were
to
be
had
but
the
public
overlooked
indeed
it
had
no
means
of
knowing
one
important
fact
the
members
of
the
clique
were
new
men
in
the
public
eye
they
represented
apparently
unlimited
capital
but
they
were
young
eager
overstrung
flushed
with
the
prospect
of
success
they
were
talking
for
publication
they
believed
they
knew
of
every
bushel
in
the
country
that
was
to
be
had
and
they
allowed
themselves
to
say
that
they
had
already
bought
more
than
this
if
this
were
true
page
was
beaten
but
it
was
not
true
the
young
men
of
the
clique
had
forgotten
that
page
had
trained
agents
in
every
part
of
the
world
that
he
had
alliances
with
great
railroad
and
steamer
lines
that
he
had
a
weather
bureau
and
a
system
of
crop
reports
that
outdid
those
of
the
united
states
government
that
he
could
command
more
money
than
two
such
cliques
and
most
important
of
all
that
he
did
talk
for
publication
the
young
speculators
were
matching
their
wits
against
a
great
machine
page
had
the
wheat
he
was
making
the
effort
of
his
career
to
deliver
it
and
he
had
no
idea
of
losing
already
millions
of
bushels
had
been
rushed
into
chicago
it
was
here
that
the
fight
took
on
its
spectacular
features
for
the
grain
must
be
weighed
and
inspected
before
it
could
be
accepted
by
the
board
of
trade
and
this
could
be
done
only
in
regular
warehouses
the
struggle
had
been
to
get
control
of
these
warehouses
it
was
here
that
the
clique
had
done
their
shrewdest
work
and
they
had
supposed
that
page
was
finally
outwitted
until
they
discovered
that
he
had
coolly
set
about
building
a
annex
to
his
new
house
calumet
and
so
it
was
that
the
newspapers
learned
that
on
the
chance
of
completing
calumet
k
before
the
of
december
hung
the
whole
question
of
winning
and
losing
that
if
bannon
should
fail
page
would
be
short
two
million
bushels
and
then
came
reporters
and
newspaper
illustrators
who
hung
about
the
office
and
badgered
hilda
or
perched
on
timber
piles
and
sketched
until
bannon
or
peterson
or
max
could
get
at
them
and
drive
them
out
young
men
with
cameras
bannon
on
his
way
to
luncheon
and
published
with
his
picture
elaborate
stories
of
his
skill
in
averting
a
strike
stories
that
were
not
at
all
true
far
out
in
minnesota
and
montana
and
south
dakota
farmers
were
driving
their
wagons
to
the
hundreds
of
local
receiving
houses
that
dotted
the
railroad
lines
box
cars
were
waiting
for
the
red
grain
to
roll
it
away
to
minneapolis
and
duluth
day
and
night
the
long
trains
were
puffing
eastward
everywhere
the
order
was
rush
railroad
presidents
and
managers
knew
that
page
was
in
a
hurry
and
they
knew
what
page
hurries
meant
not
only
to
the
thousands
of
men
who
depended
on
him
for
their
daily
bread
but
to
the
many
great
industries
of
the
northwest
whose
credit
and
integrity
were
inextricably
interwoven
with
his
division
superintendents
knew
that
page
was
in
a
hurry
and
they
snapped
out
orders
and
discharged
men
and
sent
quick
words
along
the
hot
wires
that
were
translated
by
despatchers
and
operators
and
yard
masters
into
profane
driving
commands
conductors
knew
it
brakemen
and
switchmen
knew
it
they
made
flying
switches
in
defiance
of
companies
orders
they
ran
where
they
used
to
walk
they
slung
their
lunch
pails
on
their
arms
and
ate
when
and
where
they
could
gazing
over
their
cold
tea
at
some
portrait
of
page
or
of
a
member
of
the
clique
or
of
bannon
in
the
morning
paper
elevator
men
at
minneapolis
knew
that
page
was
in
a
hurry
and
they
worked
day
and
night
at
shovel
and
scale
steamboat
masters
up
at
duluth
knew
it
and
mates
and
deck
hands
and
stevedores
and
dockwallopers
more
than
one
steamer
scraped
her
paint
in
the
haste
to
get
under
the
long
spouts
that
waited
to
pour
out
grain
by
the
hundred
thousand
bushels
trains
came
down
from
minneapolis
boats
came
down
from
duluth
warehouse
after
warehouse
at
chicago
was
filled
and
nerves
neared
the
breaking
point
as
the
short
december
days
flew
by
some
said
the
clique
would
win
some
said
page
would
win
in
the
wheat
pit
men
were
fighting
like
tigers
every
one
who
knew
the
facts
was
watching
charlie
bannon
the
storm
came
on
the
eighteenth
of
the
month
it
was
predicted
two
days
ahead
and
ship
masters
were
warned
at
all
the
lake
ports
it
was
a
northwest
blizzard
driven
down
from
the
canadian
rockies
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
leaving
two
feet
of
snow
behind
it
over
a
belt
hundreds
of
miles
wide
but
page
steamers
were
not
stopping
for
blizzards
they
headed
out
of
duluth
regardless
of
what
was
to
come
and
there
were
a
bad
few
days
with
tales
of
wreck
on
lake
and
railroad
days
of
wind
and
snow
and
bitter
cold
and
of
risks
run
that
supplied
and
yarn
spinners
with
stories
that
were
not
yet
worn
out
down
on
the
job
the
snow
brought
the
work
to
a
pause
but
bannon
within
a
was
out
of
bed
and
on
the
ground
and
there
was
no
question
of
changing
shifts
until
after
hours
the
storm
had
passed
and
elevator
annex
and
marine
tower
were
cleared
of
snow
men
worked
until
they
could
not
stagger
then
snatched
a
few
hours
sleep
where
they
could
word
was
passed
that
those
who
wished
might
observe
the
regular
hours
but
not
a
dozen
men
took
the
opportunity
for
now
they
were
in
the
public
eye
and
they
felt
as
soldiers
feel
when
after
long
months
of
drill
and
discipline
they
are
led
to
the
charge
then
came
two
days
of
biting
weather
when
ears
were
nipped
and
fingers
stiffened
and
carpenters
who
earned
three
dollars
a
day
envied
the
laborers
whose
work
kept
their
blood
moving
and
after
this
a
thaw
with
sleet
and
rain
james
the
new
delegate
came
to
bannon
and
pointed
out
that
men
who
are
continually
drenched
to
the
skin
are
not
the
best
workmen
the
boss
met
the
delegate
fairly
he
ordered
an
oilskin
coat
for
every
man
on
the
job
and
in
another
day
they
swarmed
over
the
building
looking
at
a
distance
like
glistening
yellow
beetles
but
if
chicago
was
thawing
duluth
was
not
the
harbor
at
the
western
end
of
lake
superior
was
and
it
finally
reached
a
point
that
the
tugs
could
not
break
open
the
channel
this
was
on
the
and
the
wires
were
hot
but
page
agents
succeeded
in
covering
the
facts
until
christmas
day
it
was
just
at
dusk
after
leaving
the
men
to
take
down
the
cable
that
bannon
went
to
the
office
a
newsboy
had
been
on
the
grounds
with
a
special
edition
of
a
cheap
afternoon
paper
hilda
had
taken
one
and
when
bannon
entered
the
office
he
found
her
reading
leaning
forward
on
the
desk
her
chin
on
her
hands
the
paper
spread
out
over
the
ledger
hello
he
said
throwing
off
his
dripping
oilskin
and
coming
into
the
enclosure
i
pretty
near
ready
to
sit
down
and
think
about
the
christmas
tree
that
we
ai
going
to
have
she
looked
up
and
he
saw
that
she
was
a
little
excited
her
eyes
always
told
him
during
this
last
week
she
had
been
carrying
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
work
on
her
shoulders
have
you
seen
this
she
asked
have
read
a
paper
this
week
he
leaned
over
the
desk
beside
her
and
read
the
article
in
duluth
harbor
and
at
mary
straits
a
channel
through
the
ice
had
been
blasted
out
with
dynamite
and
the
last
laden
steamer
was
now
ploughing
down
lake
michigan
already
one
steamer
was
lying
at
the
wharf
by
the
marine
tower
waiting
for
the
machinery
to
start
and
others
lay
behind
her
farther
down
the
river
long
strings
of
box
cars
filled
the
belt
line
sidings
ready
to
roll
into
the
elevator
at
the
word
bannon
seated
himself
on
the
railing
and
caught
his
toes
between
the
supports
i
tell
you
one
thing
he
said
those
fellows
have
got
to
get
up
pretty
early
in
the
morning
if
they
going
to
beat
old
page
she
looked
at
him
and
then
slowly
folded
the
paper
and
turned
toward
the
window
it
was
nearly
dark
outside
the
rain
driving
down
from
the
northeast
tapped
steadily
on
the
glass
the
arc
lamp
on
the
pole
near
the
tool
house
was
a
blurred
circle
of
light
she
was
thinking
that
they
would
have
to
get
up
pretty
early
to
beat
charlie
bannon
they
were
silent
for
a
time
silences
were
not
so
hard
as
they
had
been
a
few
weeks
before
both
looking
out
at
the
storm
and
both
thinking
that
this
was
christmas
night
on
the
afternoon
before
he
had
asked
her
to
take
a
holiday
and
she
had
shaken
her
head
i
could
i
be
here
before
noon
was
what
she
had
said
and
she
had
laughed
a
little
at
her
own
confession
and
hurried
away
with
max
she
turned
and
said
is
it
done
the
belt
gallery
he
nodded
all
done
well
she
smiled
and
he
nodded
again
the
man
the
fellow
that
was
around
the
other
day
and
measured
to
see
if
it
was
high
enough
he
out
there
looking
up
with
his
mouth
open
he
has
got
much
to
say
you
did
have
to
touch
the
tracks
at
all
not
once
ran
her
out
and
bolted
her
together
and
there
she
was
about
ready
for
my
month
off
we
have
the
wheat
coming
in
and
then
it
just
walking
down
hill
she
asked
can
you
do
it
got
to
five
or
six
days
are
any
too
much
if
it
was
an
old
house
and
the
machinery
was
working
well
i
undertake
to
do
it
in
two
or
three
but
if
we
get
through
without
ripping
up
the
gallery
or
pounding
the
leg
through
the
bottom
of
a
steamer
it
be
the
kind
of
luck
i
do
have
he
paused
and
looked
at
the
window
where
the
rain
was
streaking
the
glass
i
been
thinking
about
my
vacation
i
about
decided
to
go
to
the
lawrence
maybe
there
are
places
i
like
better
but
when
a
fellow
has
had
a
month
off
in
five
years
he
does
feel
like
experiments
it
was
the
personal
tone
again
coming
into
their
talk
in
spite
of
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
the
many
things
that
might
have
been
said
hilda
looked
down
at
the
ledger
and
fingered
the
pages
bannon
smiled
if
i
were
you
he
said
i
shut
that
up
and
fire
it
under
the
table
this
light
is
good
enough
to
work
by
anyway
she
slowly
closed
the
book
saying
i
never
worked
before
on
christmas
it
a
mistake
i
do
believe
in
it
but
somehow
it
when
my
hardest
work
always
comes
one
christmas
when
i
was
on
the
grand
trunk
there
was
a
big
wreck
at
a
junction
about
sixty
miles
down
the
road
she
saw
the
memory
coming
into
his
eyes
and
she
leaned
back
against
the
desk
playing
with
her
pen
and
now
and
then
looking
up
i
was
chief
wrecker
and
i
had
an
old
scotch
engineer
that
you
move
with
a
jack
we
rubbed
up
together
three
or
four
times
before
had
him
a
month
and
i
was
getting
tired
of
it
we
got
about
halfway
to
the
junction
that
night
and
i
felt
the
brakes
go
on
hard
and
before
i
could
get
through
the
train
and
over
the
tender
we
stopped
dead
the
scotchman
was
down
by
the
drivers
fussing
around
with
a
lantern
i
hollered
out
the
matter
there
a
bit
said
he
you
have
thought
he
was
running
a
huckleberry
train
from
the
time
he
took
i
ordered
him
into
the
cab
and
he
just
waved
his
hand
and
said
a
bit
wait
a
bit
she
be
cool
directly
bannon
chuckled
at
the
recollection
what
did
you
do
hilda
asked
jumped
for
the
lever
and
hollered
for
him
to
get
aboard
did
he
come
no
he
could
think
that
fast
he
just
stood
still
looking
at
me
while
i
threw
her
open
and
you
could
see
his
lantern
for
a
mile
back
he
never
moved
he
had
a
good
walk
back
to
the
last
station
there
was
a
long
silence
bannon
got
up
and
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
enclosure
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
i
wish
this
would
let
up
he
said
after
a
time
pausing
in
his
walk
and
looking
again
at
the
window
it
a
wonder
we
getting
things
done
at
all
hilda
eye
roaming
over
the
folded
newspaper
fell
on
the
weather
forecast
fair
she
said
and
colder
that
does
stand
for
much
they
said
the
same
thing
yesterday
it
a
worse
gamble
than
wheat
bannon
took
to
walking
again
and
hilda
stepped
down
and
stood
by
the
window
spelling
out
the
word
calumet
with
her
finger
on
the
misty
glass
at
each
turn
bannon
paused
and
looked
at
her
finally
he
stood
still
not
realizing
that
he
was
staring
until
she
looked
around
flushed
and
dropped
her
eyes
then
he
felt
awkward
and
he
began
turning
over
the
blue
prints
on
the
table
i
tell
you
what
i
have
to
do
he
said
i
rather
think
now
start
on
the
third
for
montreal
i
telling
you
a
secret
you
know
not
going
to
let
brown
or
macbride
know
where
i
be
and
if
i
can
pick
up
some
good
pictures
of
the
river
i
send
them
to
you
i
get
one
of
the
montmorency
falls
if
i
can
they
great
in
winter
why
why
thank
you
she
said
i
like
to
have
them
i
ai
much
at
writing
letters
he
went
on
but
i
send
you
the
pictures
and
you
write
and
tell
me
how
things
are
going
she
laughed
softly
and
followed
the
zigzag
course
of
the
raindrop
with
her
finger
i
would
have
very
much
to
say
she
said
speaking
with
a
little
hesitation
and
without
looking
around
max
and
i
never
do
much
oh
you
can
tell
how
your
work
goes
and
what
you
do
nights
we
do
do
much
of
anything
max
studies
some
at
night
a
man
he
used
to
work
for
gave
him
a
book
of
civil
engineering
what
do
you
do
i
read
some
and
then
i
like
to
learn
things
about
oh
about
business
and
how
things
are
done
bannon
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
he
was
looking
at
her
hair
and
at
the
curved
outline
of
one
cheek
all
that
he
could
see
of
her
face
they
both
stood
still
listening
to
the
patter
of
the
rain
and
to
the
steady
drip
from
the
other
end
of
the
office
where
there
was
a
leak
in
the
roof
once
she
cleared
her
throat
as
if
to
speak
but
no
words
came
there
was
a
stamping
outside
and
she
slipped
back
to
the
ledger
as
the
door
flew
open
bannon
turned
to
the
blue
prints
max
entered
pausing
to
knock
his
cap
against
the
door
and
wring
it
out
you
ought
to
have
stayed
out
bannon
he
said
it
the
greatest
thing
you
ever
saw
does
sag
an
inch
and
say
i
wish
you
could
hear
the
boys
talk
they
lie
down
and
let
you
walk
on
if
you
wanted
to
max
eyes
were
bright
and
his
face
red
with
exercise
and
excitement
he
came
to
the
gate
and
stood
wiping
his
feet
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
for
several
moments
before
he
felt
the
awkwardness
that
had
come
over
him
his
long
rubber
coat
was
thrown
back
and
little
streams
of
water
ran
down
his
back
and
formed
a
pool
on
the
floor
behind
him
you
better
come
out
he
said
it
the
prettiest
thing
i
ever
saw
a
clean
straight
span
from
the
main
house
to
the
tower
bannon
stood
watching
him
quizzically
then
he
turned
to
hilda
she
too
had
been
looking
at
max
but
she
turned
at
the
same
moment
and
their
eyes
met
do
you
want
to
go
he
said
she
nodded
eagerly
i
like
to
ever
so
much
then
bannon
thought
of
the
rain
but
she
saw
his
thought
as
he
glanced
toward
the
window
and
spoke
quickly
i
do
mind
really
max
will
let
me
take
his
coat
sure
said
max
and
he
grinned
she
slipped
into
it
and
it
enveloped
her
hanging
in
folds
and
falling
on
the
floor
i
have
to
hold
it
up
she
said
do
we
have
much
climbing
no
said
max
it
ai
high
and
the
stairs
are
done
you
know
hilda
lifted
the
coat
a
little
way
with
both
hands
and
put
out
one
small
toe
bannon
looked
at
it
and
shook
his
head
you
get
your
feet
wet
he
said
she
looked
up
and
met
bannon
eyes
again
with
an
expression
that
puzzled
max
i
do
care
it
almost
time
to
go
home
anyway
so
they
went
out
and
closed
the
door
and
max
who
had
been
told
to
stay
behind
and
keep
house
looked
after
them
and
then
at
the
door
and
an
odd
expression
of
slow
understanding
came
into
his
face
it
was
not
in
what
they
had
said
but
there
was
plainly
a
new
feeling
between
them
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
max
felt
that
another
knew
hilda
better
than
he
did
the
way
bannon
had
looked
at
her
and
she
at
him
the
mutual
understanding
that
left
everything
unsaid
the
something
max
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
he
saw
it
and
felt
it
and
it
disturbed
him
he
sat
on
the
table
and
swung
his
feet
while
one
expression
chased
another
over
his
face
when
he
finally
got
himself
together
he
went
to
the
door
and
opening
it
looked
out
at
the
black
dim
shape
of
the
elevator
that
stood
big
and
square
only
a
little
way
before
him
shutting
out
whatever
he
might
else
have
seen
of
rushing
sky
or
river
or
of
the
railroads
and
the
steamboats
and
the
factories
and
rolling
mills
beyond
it
was
as
if
this
elevator
were
his
fate
looming
before
him
and
shutting
out
the
forward
view
in
whatever
thoughts
he
had
had
of
the
future
in
whatever
plans
and
they
were
few
which
he
had
revolved
in
his
head
there
had
always
been
a
place
for
hilda
he
did
not
see
just
what
he
was
to
do
just
what
he
was
to
become
without
her
he
stood
there
for
a
long
time
leaning
against
the
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
the
sharper
gusts
of
rain
whirled
around
the
end
of
the
little
building
and
beat
on
him
and
then
well
it
was
charlie
bannon
and
max
knew
that
he
was
glad
it
was
no
one
else
the
narrow
windows
in
the
belt
gallery
had
no
glass
and
the
rain
came
driving
through
them
into
the
shadows
each
drop
catching
the
white
shine
of
the
electric
lights
outside
the
floor
was
trampled
with
mud
and
littered
with
scraps
of
lumber
tool
boxes
empty
nail
kegs
and
shavings
the
long
gloomy
gallery
was
empty
when
bannon
and
hilda
stepped
into
it
excepting
a
group
of
men
at
the
farther
end
installing
the
rollers
for
the
belt
conveyor
they
could
be
seen
indistinctly
against
a
light
in
the
river
house
the
wind
came
roaring
around
the
building
and
the
gallery
trembled
and
shook
hilda
caught
her
breath
and
stopped
short
it
all
right
said
bannon
she
bound
to
move
some
i
know
she
laughed
i
was
expecting
it
it
startled
me
a
little
watch
where
you
step
he
took
her
arm
and
guided
her
slowly
between
the
heaps
of
rubbish
at
one
of
the
windows
she
paused
and
stood
full
in
the
rain
looking
out
at
the
tracks
with
their
twinkling
red
and
green
lights
all
blurred
and
seeming
far
off
in
the
storm
is
this
pretty
wet
he
said
standing
beside
her
i
do
care
she
shook
the
folds
of
the
rubber
coat
and
glanced
down
at
it
i
like
it
they
looked
out
for
a
long
time
two
millwrights
came
through
the
gallery
and
glanced
at
them
but
they
did
not
turn
she
stepped
forward
and
let
the
rain
beat
on
her
face
he
stood
behind
looking
at
her
a
light
showed
far
down
the
track
and
they
heard
a
faint
whistle
a
train
he
said
and
she
nodded
the
headlight
grew
and
the
car
lights
appeared
behind
it
and
then
the
black
outline
of
the
engine
there
was
a
rush
and
a
roar
and
it
passed
under
them
does
it
make
you
want
to
jump
down
she
said
softly
when
the
roar
had
dwindled
away
he
nodded
with
a
say
he
said
a
little
later
i
do
know
about
your
writing
i
do
believe
we
better
he
got
the
words
out
more
rapidly
tell
you
what
you
do
you
come
along
with
me
and
we
wo
have
to
write
come
where
up
to
the
lawrence
we
can
start
on
the
third
just
the
same
she
did
not
answer
and
he
stopped
then
after
a
moment
she
slowly
turned
and
looked
at
him
why
she
said
i
do
think
i
i
just
been
thinking
about
it
i
guess
i
ca
do
anything
else
i
mean
i
do
want
to
go
anywhere
alone
i
guess
that
pretty
plain
is
it
what
i
mean
she
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
looked
at
him
it
was
as
if
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
face
perhaps
i
ought
to
expect
you
to
say
anything
now
he
went
on
i
just
thought
if
you
felt
anything
like
i
did
you
know
pretty
well
by
this
time
whether
it
was
yes
or
no
she
was
still
looking
at
him
he
had
said
it
all
and
now
he
waited
his
fists
knotted
tightly
and
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
almost
as
if
he
were
smiling
but
it
came
from
a
part
of
his
nature
that
had
never
before
got
to
the
surface
finally
she
said
i
think
we
better
go
back
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
and
she
turned
away
and
started
off
alone
in
a
moment
he
was
at
her
side
he
guided
her
back
as
they
had
come
and
neither
spoke
until
they
had
reached
the
stairway
then
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
the
carpenters
could
not
hear
you
do
mean
that
that
you
ca
do
it
she
shook
her
head
and
hurried
to
the
office
chapter
xvi
bannon
stood
looking
after
her
until
she
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
an
arc
lamp
and
after
that
he
continued
a
long
time
staring
into
the
blot
of
darkness
where
the
office
was
at
last
the
window
became
faintly
luminous
as
some
one
lighted
the
wall
lamp
then
as
if
it
were
a
signal
he
had
been
waiting
for
bannon
turned
away
an
hour
before
when
he
had
seen
the
last
bolt
of
the
belt
gallery
drawn
taut
he
had
become
aware
that
he
was
quite
exhausted
the
fact
was
so
obvious
that
he
had
not
tried
to
evade
it
but
had
admitted
to
himself
in
so
many
words
that
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
rope
but
when
he
turned
from
gazing
at
the
dimly
lighted
window
it
was
not
toward
his
where
he
knew
he
ought
to
be
but
back
into
the
elevator
that
his
feet
led
him
for
once
his
presence
accomplished
nothing
he
went
about
without
thinking
where
he
passed
men
without
seeing
who
they
were
or
what
they
were
doing
when
he
walked
through
the
belt
gallery
he
saw
the
foreman
of
the
big
gang
of
men
at
work
there
was
handling
them
clumsily
so
that
they
interfered
with
each
other
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
give
the
orders
that
would
set
things
right
then
as
if
his
muscles
had
not
done
work
enough
he
climbed
laboriously
to
the
very
top
of
the
marine
tower
he
was
leaning
against
a
not
looking
out
for
he
saw
nothing
but
with
his
face
turned
to
the
fleet
of
barges
lying
in
the
river
when
some
one
spoke
to
him
i
guess
you
thinking
about
that
christmas
dinner
ai
you
mr
bannon
what
that
he
demanded
wheeling
about
then
rallying
his
scattered
faculties
he
recognized
one
of
the
carpenters
oh
yes
he
said
laughing
tardily
yes
the
postponed
christmas
dinner
you
think
i
in
for
it
do
you
you
know
it
no
go
unless
this
house
is
full
of
wheat
clear
to
the
roof
i
know
it
said
the
man
but
i
guess
we
going
to
stick
you
for
it
do
you
think
we
are
i
guess
that
right
i
come
up
here
said
the
carpenter
well
pleased
at
the
chance
for
a
talk
with
the
boss
to
have
a
look
at
this
marine
leg
do
you
call
it
i
have
been
to
work
on
it
and
i
never
saw
one
before
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
it
works
just
like
any
other
leg
over
in
the
main
house
head
pulley
up
here
another
one
down
in
the
boot
endless
belt
running
over
with
steel
cups
rivetted
on
it
to
scoop
up
the
grain
only
difference
is
that
instead
of
being
stationary
and
set
up
in
a
tank
this
one
hung
up
we
let
the
whole
business
right
down
into
the
boat
pull
it
up
and
down
with
that
steam
winch
the
man
shook
his
head
what
if
it
got
away
from
you
that
happened
said
bannon
i
seen
a
leg
most
as
big
as
this
smash
through
two
decks
thought
it
was
going
right
on
through
the
bottom
of
the
boat
but
that
was
a
leg
that
macbride
had
hung
up
this
one
wo
fall
bannon
answered
one
or
two
more
questions
rather
at
random
then
suddenly
came
back
to
earth
what
are
you
doing
here
anyway
he
demanded
seems
to
me
this
is
a
pretty
easy
way
to
earn
thirty
cents
an
hour
i
i
was
just
going
to
see
if
there
was
something
i
could
do
the
man
answered
a
good
deal
embarrassed
then
before
bannon
could
do
more
than
echo
something
to
do
added
i
do
get
my
time
check
till
midnight
i
ai
on
this
shift
i
just
come
around
to
see
how
things
was
going
we
going
to
see
you
through
mr
bannon
bannon
never
had
a
finer
tribute
than
that
not
even
what
young
page
said
when
the
race
was
over
and
it
could
not
have
come
at
a
moment
when
he
needed
it
more
he
did
not
think
much
in
set
terms
about
what
it
meant
but
when
the
man
had
gone
and
he
had
turned
back
to
the
window
he
took
a
long
breath
of
the
night
air
and
he
saw
what
lay
beneath
his
eyes
he
saw
the
line
of
ships
in
the
river
down
nearer
the
lake
another
of
page
elevators
was
drinking
up
the
red
wheat
out
of
the
hold
of
a
barge
across
the
river
in
the
dark
they
were
backing
another
string
of
cars
over
the
belt
line
switches
as
he
looked
out
and
listened
his
imagination
took
fire
again
as
it
had
taken
fire
that
day
in
the
at
blake
city
when
he
had
learned
that
the
little
was
trying
to
hinder
the
torrent
of
the
northern
wheat
well
the
wheat
had
come
down
it
had
beaten
a
blizzard
it
had
churned
and
wedged
and
crushed
its
way
through
floating
ice
and
in
the
trough
of
mauling
seas
belated
passenger
trains
had
waited
on
lonely
sidings
while
it
thundered
by
and
big
rotary
ploughs
had
bitten
a
way
for
it
across
the
drifted
prairies
now
it
was
here
and
charlie
bannon
was
keeping
it
waiting
he
stood
there
looking
only
a
moment
then
before
the
footsteps
were
well
out
of
hearing
he
followed
him
down
the
stairway
to
the
belt
gallery
before
he
had
passed
half
its
length
you
could
have
seen
the
difference
in
the
next
two
hours
every
man
on
the
elevator
saw
him
learned
a
quicker
way
to
splice
a
rope
or
align
a
shaft
and
heard
before
the
boss
went
away
some
word
of
commendation
that
set
his
hands
to
working
the
faster
and
made
the
work
seem
easy
the
work
had
gone
on
without
interruption
for
weeks
and
never
slowly
but
there
were
times
when
it
went
with
a
lilt
and
a
laugh
when
laborers
heaved
at
a
hoisting
tackle
with
a
like
privateersmen
who
have
just
sighted
a
sail
when
with
all
they
could
do
results
came
too
slowly
and
the
hours
flew
too
fast
and
so
it
was
that
christmas
night
charlie
bannon
was
back
on
the
job
about
ten
he
encountered
pete
bearing
off
to
the
shanty
a
quart
bottle
of
cold
coffee
and
a
dozen
big
thick
sandwiches
come
on
charlie
he
called
max
is
coming
too
but
i
guess
we
got
enough
to
spare
you
a
little
so
the
three
of
them
sat
down
to
supper
around
the
and
between
bites
bannon
talked
a
little
about
everything
but
principally
and
with
much
corroborative
detail
for
the
story
seemed
to
strain
even
pete
easy
credulity
of
how
up
at
yawger
he
had
been
run
on
the
independent
ticket
for
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
and
had
been
barely
defeated
by
two
votes
when
the
sandwiches
were
put
away
and
all
but
three
drinks
of
the
coffee
bannon
held
the
bottle
high
in
the
air
here
to
the
house
he
said
we
have
wheat
in
her
night
they
drank
the
toast
standing
then
as
if
ashamed
of
such
a
sentimental
demonstration
they
filed
sheepishly
out
of
the
office
they
walked
fifty
paces
in
silence
then
pete
checked
suddenly
and
turned
to
bannon
hold
on
charlie
where
are
you
going
going
to
look
over
those
conveyor
drives
down
cellar
no
you
ai
either
you
going
to
bed
bannon
only
laughed
and
started
on
toward
the
elevator
how
long
is
it
since
you
had
any
sleep
pete
demanded
i
do
know
guess
i
must
have
slept
part
of
the
time
while
we
was
putting
up
that
gallery
i
do
remember
much
about
it
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
pete
and
as
he
said
it
he
reached
out
his
left
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
it
was
more
by
way
of
gesture
than
otherwise
but
bannon
had
to
step
back
a
pace
to
keep
his
feet
i
mean
business
pete
went
on
though
laughing
a
little
when
we
begin
to
turn
over
the
machinery
you
wo
want
to
go
away
so
this
is
your
last
chance
to
get
any
sleep
i
ca
make
things
jump
like
you
can
but
i
can
keep
going
somehow
had
you
better
wrap
me
up
in
cotton
flannel
and
feed
me
warm
milk
with
a
spoon
let
go
of
me
and
quit
your
fooling
you
delay
the
game
i
ai
fooling
i
boss
here
at
night
and
i
fire
you
till
morning
that
goes
if
i
have
to
carry
you
all
the
way
to
your
boarding
house
and
tie
you
down
to
the
bed
pete
meant
it
as
if
again
for
illustration
he
picked
bannon
up
in
his
arms
the
boss
was
ready
for
the
move
this
time
and
he
resisted
with
all
his
strength
but
he
would
have
had
as
much
chance
against
the
hug
of
a
grizzly
bear
he
was
crumpled
up
pete
started
off
with
him
across
the
flat
all
right
said
bannon
i
go
at
seven
next
morning
pete
began
expecting
his
return
at
eight
he
began
inquiring
of
various
foremen
if
they
had
seen
anything
of
charlie
bannon
by
nine
he
was
avowedly
worried
lest
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
and
a
little
after
ten
max
set
out
for
the
boarding
house
encountering
the
landlady
in
the
hall
he
made
the
mistake
of
asking
her
if
she
had
seen
anything
of
bannon
that
morning
she
had
some
elementary
notions
of
strategy
derived
doubtless
from
experience
and
before
beginning
her
reply
she
blocked
the
narrow
stairway
with
her
broad
person
then
beginning
with
a
discussion
of
excellent
moral
character
and
his
most
imprudent
habits
and
illustrating
by
anecdotes
of
various
other
boarders
she
had
had
at
one
time
and
another
she
led
up
to
the
statement
that
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
since
the
night
before
and
that
she
had
twice
knocked
at
his
door
without
getting
any
reply
max
who
had
laughed
a
little
at
pete
alarm
was
now
pretty
well
frightened
himself
but
at
that
instant
they
heard
the
thud
of
bare
feet
on
the
floor
just
above
them
that
him
now
said
the
landlady
thoughtlessly
turning
sideways
and
max
bolted
past
her
and
up
the
stairs
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
called
out
to
know
if
he
could
come
in
the
growl
he
heard
in
reply
meant
invitation
as
much
as
it
meant
anything
so
he
went
in
bannon
already
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
his
face
in
the
washbowl
as
he
scoured
he
sputtered
max
could
make
little
out
of
it
for
bannon
face
was
under
water
half
the
time
but
he
caught
such
phrases
as
pete
darned
foolishness
college
boy
trick
lie
abed
all
the
morning
and
better
get
an
alarm
clock
which
thing
and
the
need
for
it
bannon
greatly
despised
and
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
was
nothing
more
serious
than
that
bannon
had
overslept
but
the
boss
took
it
seriously
enough
indeed
he
seemed
deeply
humiliated
and
he
marched
back
to
the
elevator
beside
max
without
saying
a
word
until
just
as
they
were
crossing
the
belt
line
tracks
when
the
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
came
to
him
i
know
where
i
get
it
from
he
exclaimed
as
if
in
some
measure
relieved
by
the
discovery
i
must
take
after
my
uncle
he
was
the
greatest
fellow
to
sleep
you
ever
saw
so
far
as
pace
was
concerned
that
day
was
like
the
others
while
the
men
were
human
it
could
be
no
faster
with
bannon
on
the
job
it
could
not
flag
but
there
was
this
difference
that
the
stupidest
sweepers
knew
that
they
had
almost
reached
the
end
and
there
was
a
rally
like
that
which
a
runner
makes
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
hundred
yards
late
in
the
afternoon
they
had
a
broad
hint
of
how
near
the
end
was
the
sweepers
dropped
their
brooms
and
began
carrying
fire
buckets
full
of
water
they
placed
one
or
more
near
every
bearing
all
over
the
elevator
the
men
who
were
quickest
to
understand
explained
to
the
slower
ones
what
the
precaution
meant
and
every
man
had
his
eye
on
the
nearest
pulley
to
see
when
it
would
begin
to
turn
but
bannon
was
not
going
to
begin
till
he
was
ready
he
had
inspected
the
whole
job
four
times
since
noon
but
just
after
six
he
went
all
over
it
again
more
carefully
than
before
at
the
end
he
stepped
out
of
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
bin
and
pulled
it
shut
after
him
it
was
not
yet
painted
and
its
blank
surface
suggested
something
he
drew
out
his
blue
pencil
and
wrote
on
the
upper
panel
bannon
then
he
walked
over
to
the
power
house
it
was
a
brick
building
with
whose
construction
bannon
had
had
no
concern
as
page
company
had
placed
the
contract
for
it
elsewhere
every
night
for
the
past
week
lights
had
been
streaming
from
its
windows
and
day
and
night
men
had
waited
ready
at
any
time
for
the
word
to
go
ahead
a
dozen
of
them
were
lounging
about
the
space
in
front
of
the
battery
of
boilers
when
bannon
opened
the
door
and
they
sprang
to
their
feet
as
they
read
his
errand
in
his
face
steam
up
he
said
we
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
there
was
the
accumulated
tension
of
a
week
of
inactivity
behind
these
men
and
the
effect
of
bannon
words
was
galvanic
already
low
fires
were
burning
under
the
boilers
and
now
the
coal
was
piled
on
the
draughts
roared
the
smoke
thick
enough
to
cut
came
billowing
out
of
the
tall
chimney
every
man
in
the
room
even
the
wretchedest
of
the
dripping
stokers
had
his
eyes
on
the
steam
gauges
but
for
all
that
the
water
boiled
and
the
indicator
needles
crept
slowly
round
the
dials
and
at
last
the
engineer
walked
over
and
pulled
the
whistle
cord
hitherto
they
had
marked
the
divisions
of
time
on
the
job
by
the
shrill
note
of
the
little
whistle
on
the
hoisting
engine
boiler
and
there
was
not
a
man
but
started
at
the
screaming
crescendo
of
the
big
siren
on
top
of
the
power
house
men
in
the
streets
in
the
straggling
boarding
houses
over
across
the
flats
on
the
wharves
along
the
river
men
who
had
been
forbidden
to
come
to
the
elevator
till
they
were
needed
lest
they
should
be
in
the
way
had
been
waiting
days
for
that
signal
and
they
came
streaming
into
the
elevator
almost
before
the
blast
had
died
away
page
superintendent
was
standing
beside
bannon
and
pete
by
the
foot
of
the
main
drive
well
he
said
we
ready
are
you
bannon
nodded
and
turned
to
a
laborer
who
stood
near
go
tell
the
engineer
to
go
ahead
the
man
proud
as
though
he
had
just
been
promoted
went
out
on
the
run
now
said
bannon
here
where
we
go
slow
all
the
machinery
in
the
house
has
got
to
be
thrown
in
one
thing
at
a
time
line
shafts
first
and
then
elevators
and
the
rest
of
it
pete
you
see
it
done
up
top
i
look
out
for
it
down
here
see
that
there
a
man
to
look
at
each
bearing
at
least
once
in
three
minutes
and
let
me
know
if
it
gets
warm
it
took
a
long
time
to
do
it
but
it
had
to
be
done
for
bannon
was
inflexible
but
at
last
everything
in
elevator
annex
and
spouting
house
that
could
turn
was
turning
and
it
was
reported
to
bannon
now
he
said
she
got
to
run
light
for
fifteen
minutes
no
he
went
on
in
answer
to
the
superintendent
protest
you
lucky
i
did
say
two
hours
it
the
biggest
chance
i
ever
took
as
it
is
so
while
they
stared
at
the
second
hands
of
their
watches
the
minutes
crept
away
pete
wound
his
watch
up
tight
in
the
vain
hope
of
making
it
go
a
little
faster
and
at
last
bannon
turned
with
a
nod
to
the
superintendent
all
right
he
said
you
the
boss
now
and
then
in
a
moment
the
straining
hawsers
were
hauling
cars
up
into
the
house
the
seals
were
broken
the
doors
rolled
back
and
the
wheat
came
pouring
out
the
shovellers
clambered
into
the
cars
and
the
steam
power
shovels
helped
the
torrent
along
it
fell
through
the
gratings
into
steel
tanks
and
then
the
tireless
metal
cups
carried
it
up
up
up
to
the
top
of
the
building
and
then
it
came
tumbling
down
again
down
into
garners
and
down
again
into
the
great
weighing
hoppers
and
recognized
and
registered
and
marketable
at
last
part
of
the
load
that
was
to
bury
the
clique
that
had
braved
it
out
of
sight
of
all
but
their
creditors
it
went
streaming
down
the
spouts
into
the
bins
the
first
of
the
barges
in
the
river
was
moved
down
beside
the
spouting
house
her
main
hatch
just
opposite
the
tower
and
now
pete
in
charge
there
gave
the
word
and
the
marine
leg
gravely
deliberately
descended
there
is
a
magnificent
audacity
about
that
sort
of
performance
the
leg
was
ninety
feet
long
framed
of
great
timbers
heavy
enough
to
have
wrecked
the
barge
like
a
birch
bark
canoe
if
it
had
got
away
it
went
down
bodily
into
the
hold
and
the
steel
boot
was
buried
in
wheat
then
pete
threw
another
lever
and
in
a
moment
another
endless
series
of
cups
was
carrying
the
wheat
aloft
it
went
over
the
and
down
a
spout
then
stretched
out
in
a
golden
ribbon
along
the
glistening
white
belt
that
ran
the
length
of
the
gallery
then
like
the
wheat
from
the
cars
it
was
caught
up
again
in
the
cups
and
shot
down
through
spouts
and
carried
along
on
belts
to
the
remotest
bins
in
the
annex
for
the
first
few
hours
of
it
the
men
nerves
were
hair
springs
but
as
time
went
on
and
the
stream
kept
pouring
in
without
pause
the
tension
relaxed
though
the
watch
never
slackened
men
patted
the
bearings
affectionately
and
still
the
same
report
came
to
bannon
all
cool
late
that
night
as
the
superintendent
was
figuring
his
weighing
reports
he
said
to
bannon
at
this
rate
we
have
several
hours
to
spare
we
have
had
our
accident
yet
said
bannon
shortly
it
happened
within
an
hour
at
the
marine
leg
but
it
was
not
serious
they
heard
a
splintering
sound
down
in
the
dark
somewhere
and
pete
shouting
to
them
to
throw
out
the
clutch
climbed
out
and
down
on
the
girders
that
framed
the
leg
an
agile
monkey
might
have
been
glad
to
return
alive
from
such
a
climb
but
pete
came
back
presently
with
a
curious
specimen
of
marine
hardware
that
had
in
some
way
got
into
the
wheat
and
thence
into
the
boot
and
one
of
the
cups
part
way
up
it
had
got
jammed
and
had
ripped
up
the
sheathing
of
the
leg
they
started
the
leg
again
but
soon
learned
that
it
was
leaking
badly
you
have
to
haul
up
for
repairs
i
guess
the
captain
called
up
to
them
have
time
said
pete
under
his
breath
and
with
a
hammer
and
nails
and
a
big
piece
of
sacking
he
went
down
the
leg
again
playing
his
neck
against
a
delay
as
serenely
as
most
men
would
walk
downstairs
to
dinner
start
her
up
boys
he
called
when
the
job
was
done
and
with
the
leg
jolting
under
his
hands
as
he
climbed
he
came
back
into
the
tower
that
was
their
only
misfortune
and
all
it
cost
them
was
a
matter
of
minutes
so
by
noon
of
the
thirtieth
an
hour
or
two
after
macbride
and
young
page
arrived
from
minneapolis
it
became
clear
that
they
would
be
through
in
time
at
eight
next
morning
as
bannon
and
macbride
were
standing
in
the
superintendent
office
he
came
in
and
held
out
his
hand
full
bannon
i
congratulate
you
full
eh
said
macbride
then
he
dropped
his
hand
on
shoulder
well
he
said
do
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
or
will
you
come
and
talk
business
with
me
for
a
little
while
sleep
bannon
echoed
i
been
oversleeping
lately
chapter
xvii
the
elevator
was
the
place
for
the
dinner
if
only
the
mild
weather
that
had
followed
the
christmas
storm
should
continue
on
that
bannon
pete
and
max
were
agreed
new
year
day
would
be
a
holiday
and
there
was
room
on
the
distributing
floor
for
every
man
who
had
worked
an
hour
on
the
job
since
the
first
spile
had
been
driven
home
in
the
calumet
clay
to
be
sure
most
of
the
laborers
had
been
laid
off
before
the
installing
of
the
machinery
but
bannon
knew
that
they
would
all
be
on
hand
and
he
meant
to
have
seats
for
them
but
on
the
night
of
the
thirtieth
the
wind
swung
around
to
the
northeast
and
it
came
whistling
through
the
cracks
in
the
cupola
walls
with
a
sting
in
it
that
set
the
weighers
to
shivering
and
as
the
insurance
companies
would
have
inquired
curiously
into
any
arrangement
for
heating
that
gloomy
space
on
the
tops
of
the
bins
the
plan
had
to
be
given
up
as
soon
as
the
last
of
the
grain
was
in
on
the
max
took
a
car
and
scoured
south
chicago
for
a
hall
that
was
big
enough
before
the
afternoon
was
gone
he
had
found
it
and
had
arranged
with
a
restaurant
keeper
to
supply
the
dinner
early
the
next
morning
the
three
set
to
work
making
long
tables
and
benches
by
resting
planks
on
boxes
and
covering
the
tables
with
pink
and
blue
and
white
scalloped
it
was
nearly
ten
when
max
after
draping
a
flag
in
a
dozen
different
ways
let
it
slide
down
the
ladder
to
the
floor
and
sat
down
on
the
upper
round
looking
out
over
the
gridiron
of
tables
with
a
disgusted
expression
peterson
aided
by
a
man
from
the
restaurant
was
bringing
in
load
after
load
of
thick
white
plates
stacking
them
waist
high
near
the
door
max
was
on
the
point
of
calling
to
him
but
he
recollected
that
pete
eye
though
quick
with
timbers
would
not
help
much
in
questions
of
art
just
then
bannon
came
through
the
doorway
with
another
flag
rolled
under
his
arm
they
here
already
a
couple
of
dozen
of
he
said
as
he
dropped
the
flag
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
i
left
james
on
the
stairs
to
keep
out
until
we
ready
better
have
an
eye
on
the
fire
escape
too
they
feeling
pretty
lively
say
max
said
abruptly
i
ca
make
this
thing
look
anyhow
i
guess
it
up
to
you
bannon
stepped
back
and
looked
up
at
the
wall
why
do
you
just
hang
them
from
the
ceiling
and
then
catch
them
up
from
pretty
near
the
bottom
so
they
drape
down
on
both
sides
of
the
windows
i
know
said
max
but
there
ways
of
making
look
just
right
if
hilda
was
here
she
know
he
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
red
white
and
blue
heap
on
the
floor
during
the
last
week
they
had
not
spoken
of
hilda
and
bannon
did
not
know
whether
she
had
told
max
he
glanced
at
him
but
got
no
sign
for
max
was
gazing
moodily
downward
do
you
think
bannon
said
do
you
think
she
care
to
come
around
he
tried
to
speak
easily
as
he
might
have
spoken
of
her
at
any
time
before
christmas
day
but
he
could
not
check
a
second
glance
at
max
at
that
moment
max
looked
up
and
as
their
eyes
met
with
an
awkward
pause
bannon
knew
that
he
understood
and
for
a
moment
the
impatience
that
he
had
been
fighting
for
a
week
threatened
to
get
away
with
him
he
had
seen
nothing
of
hilda
except
for
the
daily
good
morning
and
a
word
now
and
then
the
office
had
been
besieged
by
reporters
waiting
for
a
chance
at
him
had
been
rushing
in
and
out
representatives
and
the
railroad
and
steamboat
men
had
made
it
their
headquarters
it
may
be
that
he
would
not
have
spoken
in
any
case
for
he
had
said
all
that
he
could
say
and
he
knew
that
she
would
give
him
an
answer
when
she
could
max
eyes
had
dropped
again
you
mean
for
her
to
help
fix
things
up
he
asked
bannon
nodded
and
then
as
max
did
not
look
up
he
said
yes
why
why
yes
i
guess
she
just
as
soon
he
hesitated
then
began
coming
down
the
ladder
adding
i
go
for
her
bannon
looked
over
his
shoulder
pete
was
clattering
about
among
the
dishes
max
he
said
hold
on
a
minute
max
turned
and
came
slowly
back
bannon
had
seated
himself
on
the
end
of
a
table
and
now
he
waited
looking
down
at
the
two
rows
of
plates
and
slowly
turning
a
caster
that
stood
at
his
elbow
what
he
finally
said
was
not
what
max
was
awaiting
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
max
when
you
through
on
this
job
why
i
do
know
have
you
got
anything
ahead
nothing
sure
i
was
working
for
a
firm
of
contractors
up
on
the
north
side
and
i
been
thinking
maybe
they
take
me
back
you
had
some
experience
in
building
before
now
have
you
bannon
was
speaking
deliberately
as
if
he
were
saying
what
he
had
thought
out
before
yes
a
good
deal
it
what
i
mostly
done
since
i
quit
the
lumber
business
when
macbride
was
here
said
bannon
he
told
me
that
we
got
a
contract
for
a
new
house
at
indianapolis
it
going
to
be
concrete
from
the
spiles
up

the
country

down
next
week
to
take
charge
of
the
job
and
if
you
like
to
go
along
as
my
assistant
i
take
you
max
did
not
know
what
to
say
at
first
he
grinned
and
blushed
thinking
only
that
bannon
had
been
pleased
with
his
work
then
he
grew
serious
well
said
bannon
what
do
you
say
max
still
hesitated
at
last
he
replied
can
i
have
till
to
think
about
it
i
you
see
hilda
and
i
we
most
always
talk
things
over
and
i
do
exactly
like
to
do
anything
without
sure
said
bannon
think
it
over
if
you
like
there
no
hurry
up
to
the
end
of
the
week
he
paused
as
if
he
meant
to
go
on
but
changed
his
mind
and
stood
up
max
too
was
waiting
as
if
there
were
more
to
be
said
you
two
must
think
we
got
all
day
to
fix
things
it
was
pete
calling
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
there
ai
no
loafing
allowed
here
bannon
smiled
and
max
turned
away
but
after
he
had
got
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
aisle
he
came
back
say
bannon
he
said
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
hilda
she
said
she
told
me
something
about
things
and
i
want
to
it
had
been
a
lame
conversation
now
it
broke
down
and
they
stood
through
a
long
silence
without
speaking
finally
max
pulled
himself
together
and
said
in
a
low
nervous
voice
say
it
all
right
i
guess
you
know
what
i
thinking
about
and
i
ai
got
a
word
to
say
then
he
hurried
out
when
max
and
hilda
came
in
the
restaurant
man
was
setting
up
the
paper
napkin
tents
on
the
raised
table
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
pete
stood
by
the
door
looking
upon
his
work
with
satisfaction
he
did
not
see
them
until
they
were
fairly
in
the
room
hello
he
said
i
did
know
you
was
coming
miss
vogel
he
swept
his
arm
around
ai
it
fine
make
you
hungry
to
look
at
all
them
plates
hilda
followed
his
gesture
with
a
smile
her
jacket
was
still
buttoned
tightly
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
her
cheeks
red
from
the
brisk
outer
air
bannon
and
james
were
coming
toward
them
and
she
greeted
them
with
a
nod
there
going
to
be
plenty
of
room
she
said
that
right
pete
replied
there
wo
be
no
elbows
getting
in
the
way
at
this
dinner
come
up
where
you
can
see
better
he
led
the
way
to
the
platform
and
they
all
followed
this
is
the
speakers
table
pete
went
on
where
the
boss
and
all
will
be
he
winked
toward
bannon
and
the
guest
of
honor
you
show
her
how
we
sit
max
you
fixed
that
part
of
it
max
walked
around
the
table
pointing
out
his
own
pete
james
and
bannon
seats
and
those
of
the
committee
the
middle
seat
next
to
bannon
he
passed
over
hold
on
said
pete
you
forgot
something
max
grinned
and
drew
back
the
middle
chair
this
is
for
the
guest
of
honor
he
said
and
looked
at
hilda
pete
was
looking
at
her
too
and
james
all
but
bannon
the
color
that
had
been
leaving
her
face
began
to
come
back
do
you
mean
me
she
asked
i
guess
that
pretty
near
said
pete
she
shook
her
head
oh
no
thank
you
very
much
i
ca
stay
pete
and
max
looked
at
each
other
the
boys
be
sorry
said
pete
it
kind
of
got
out
that
maybe
you
be
here
and
i
do
believe
they
let
you
off
hilda
was
smiling
but
her
face
was
flushed
she
shook
her
head
oh
no
she
replied
i
only
came
to
help
pete
turned
on
max
with
a
clumsy
laugh
that
did
not
cover
his
disappointment
how
about
this
max
you
ai
been
tending
to
business
ai
that
so
james
was
he
going
to
see
that
she
come
and
sat
up
with
us
where
the
boys
could
see
her
he
turned
to
hilda
you
see
most
of
the
boys
know
you
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
things
on
the
job
and
they
kind
of
took
a
shine
to
you
pete
suddenly
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
had
never
talked
so
boldly
to
a
girl
before
he
hesitated
looked
around
at
max
and
james
for
support
and
at
bannon
and
then
finding
no
help
he
grinned
and
the
warm
color
surged
over
his
face
the
only
one
who
saw
it
all
was
hilda
and
in
spite
of
her
embarrassment
the
sight
of
big
strong
bashful
pete
was
too
much
for
her
a
twinkle
came
into
her
eyes
and
a
faint
smile
hovered
about
her
mouth
pete
saw
it
misunderstood
it
and
feeling
relieved
went
on
not
knowing
that
by
bringing
that
twinkle
to
hilda
eyes
he
had
saved
the
situation
it
only
that
they
talked
about
it
some
and
yesterday
a
couple
of
spoke
to
me
and
i
said
i
ask
max
and
thank
you
peterson
hilda
replied
max
should
have
told
me
she
turned
toward
max
her
face
sober
now
except
for
the
eyes
which
would
not
come
under
control
max
had
been
dividing
his
glances
between
her
and
bannon
feeling
the
situation
heavily
and
wondering
if
he
ought
not
to
come
to
her
relief
but
unable
to
dig
up
the
right
word
pete
spoke
up
again
say
honest
now
ai
you
coming
i
ca
really
i
sorry
i
know
you
have
a
good
time
bannon
had
been
standing
aside
unwilling
to
speak
for
fear
of
making
it
harder
for
her
but
now
she
turned
to
him
and
said
with
a
lightness
that
puzzled
him
are
we
going
to
do
some
decorating
bannon
i
afraid
it
will
be
dinner
time
before
peterson
knows
it
pete
flushed
again
at
this
but
she
gave
him
a
quick
smile
yes
said
bannon
there
only
a
little
over
half
an
hour
he
paused
and
looked
about
the
group
holding
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
fingering
the
stem
the
lines
about
his
mouth
were
settling
hilda
glanced
again
at
him
and
from
the
determined
look
in
his
eyes
she
knew
that
his
week
of
waiting
was
over
that
he
meant
to
speak
to
her
before
she
left
the
hall
it
was
all
in
the
moment
silence
that
followed
his
remark
then
he
went
on
as
easily
as
if
he
were
talking
to
a
gang
on
the
marine
tower
but
the
time
was
long
enough
for
hilda
to
feel
her
brief
courage
slipping
away
she
could
not
look
at
him
now
take
a
look
at
that
door
james
he
was
saying
i
guess
you
have
to
tend
to
business
if
you
want
any
dinner
they
all
turned
and
saw
the
grinning
heads
of
some
of
the
carpenters
peering
into
the
room
there
was
the
shuffling
of
many
feet
behind
them
on
the
stairs
and
the
sound
of
cat
calls
and
whistling
a
shove
was
passed
on
from
somewhere
back
in
the
hallway
and
one
of
the
carpenters
came
sprawling
through
the
door
the
others
yelled
i
fix
said
james
with
a
laugh
starting
toward
them
give
him
a
lift
pete
said
bannon
he
need
it
you
two
better
keep
the
stairs
clear
for
a
while
or
they
stampede
us
so
pete
followed
and
for
a
few
moments
the
uproar
from
the
stairs
drowned
all
attempts
at
conversation
only
max
was
left
with
them
now
he
stood
back
by
the
wall
still
looking
helplessly
from
one
to
the
other
the
restaurant
men
were
bustling
about
the
floor
and
hilda
was
glad
they
were
there
for
she
knew
that
bannon
meant
to
send
max
away
too
she
was
too
nervous
to
stand
still
and
she
walked
around
the
table
resetting
the
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
the
paper
napkins
on
this
table
were
the
only
ones
in
the
room
she
wondered
at
this
and
when
the
noise
of
the
men
had
died
away
into
a
few
jeering
cries
from
the
street
and
max
had
gone
to
get
the
flags
for
she
had
said
that
they
should
be
hung
at
this
end
of
the
room
and
the
waiters
were
bustling
about
it
gave
her
a
chance
to
break
the
silence
are
the
other
she
had
to
stop
to
clear
her
throat
are
the
other
men
going
to
have
napkins
they
would
know
what
they
were
for
his
easy
tone
gave
her
a
momentary
sense
of
relief
they
tie
them
on
their
hats
or
make
balls
to
throw
around
he
paused
but
added
it
would
look
bad
though
would
it
to
stand
them
up
this
way
on
all
the
tables
she
made
no
reply
what
do
you
say
he
was
looking
at
her
shall
we
do
it
she
nodded
and
then
dropped
her
eyes
angry
with
herself
that
she
could
not
overcome
her
nervousness
there
was
another
silence
and
she
broke
it
it
would
look
a
good
deal
better
she
said
if
you
have
time
to
do
it
max
and
i
will
put
up
the
flags
she
had
meant
to
say
something
that
would
give
her
a
better
control
of
the
situation
but
it
sounded
very
flat
and
disagreeable
and
she
had
not
meant
it
to
sound
disagreeable
indeed
as
soon
as
the
words
were
out
and
she
felt
his
eyes
on
her
and
she
knew
that
she
was
blushing
she
was
not
sure
that
she
had
meant
it
at
all
perhaps
that
was
why
when
bannon
asked
in
a
low
voice
would
you
rather
max
would
help
you
she
turned
away
and
answered
in
a
cool
tone
that
did
not
come
from
any
one
of
her
rushing
struggling
thoughts
if
you
do
mind
she
did
not
see
the
change
that
came
over
his
face
the
weary
look
that
meant
that
the
strain
of
a
week
had
suddenly
broken
but
she
did
not
need
to
see
it
for
she
knew
it
was
there
she
heard
him
step
down
from
the
platform
and
then
she
watched
him
as
he
walked
down
the
aisle
to
meet
max
who
was
bringing
up
the
flags
she
wondered
impatiently
why
bannon
did
not
call
to
him
then
he
raised
his
head
but
before
a
word
had
left
his
lips
she
was
speaking
in
a
clear
tone
that
max
could
plainly
hear
she
was
surprised
at
herself
she
had
not
meant
to
say
a
word
but
out
it
came
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
tightening
of
her
nerves
and
a
defiant
gladness
that
at
last
her
real
thoughts
had
found
an
outlet
max
she
said
wo
you
go
out
and
get
enough
napkins
to
put
at
all
the
places
you
have
to
hurry
bannon
was
slow
in
turning
when
he
did
there
was
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
hold
on
there
called
a
waiter
there
ai
time
to
fold
them
yes
there
is
said
bannon
shortly
the
boys
can
wait
but
dinner
most
ready
now
then
i
guess
dinner
got
to
wait
too
the
waiter
looked
disgusted
and
max
hurried
out
bannon
gathered
up
the
flags
and
came
to
the
platform
hilda
could
not
face
him
for
an
instant
she
had
a
wild
impulse
to
follow
max
she
finally
turned
her
back
on
bannon
and
leaned
her
elbows
on
a
chair
looking
over
the
wall
for
a
good
place
to
hang
the
flags
she
was
going
to
begin
talking
about
it
as
soon
as
he
should
reach
the
platform
the
words
were
all
ready
but
now
he
was
opposite
her
looking
across
the
table
with
the
red
and
white
bundle
in
his
arms
and
she
had
not
said
it
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
napkin
studying
out
the
curious
japanese
design
she
could
hear
his
breathing
and
her
own
she
let
her
eyes
rise
as
high
as
the
flags
then
slowly
higher
and
higher
until
they
met
his
fluttered
and
dropped
but
the
glance
was
enough
she
could
not
have
resisted
the
look
in
his
eyes
did
you
mean
it
he
asked
almost
breathlessly
did
you
mean
the
whole
thing
she
could
not
reply
she
glanced
around
to
see
if
the
waiters
could
hear
ca
you
tell
me
he
was
saying
it
been
a
week
she
gazed
at
the
napkin
until
it
grew
misty
and
indistinct
then
she
slowly
nodded
a
waiter
was
almost
within
hearing
bannon
stood
looking
at
her
heedless
of
everything
but
that
she
was
there
before
him
that
her
eyes
were
trying
to
peep
up
at
him
through
the
locks
of
red
gold
hair
that
had
strayed
over
her
forehead
please
she
whispered
please
put
them
up
and
so
they
set
to
work
he
got
the
ladder
and
she
told
him
what
to
do
her
directions
were
not
always
clear
but
that
mattered
little
for
he
could
not
have
followed
them
somehow
the
flags
went
up
and
if
the
effect
was
little
better
than
max
attempt
had
been
no
one
spoke
of
it
pete
and
max
came
in
together
soon
with
the
napkins
and
a
little
time
slipped
by
before
bannon
could
draw
max
aside
and
grip
his
hand
then
they
went
at
the
napkins
and
as
they
sat
around
the
table
hilda
and
bannon
pete
and
the
waiters
folding
them
with
rapid
fingers
bannon
found
opportunity
to
talk
to
her
in
a
low
voice
during
the
times
when
pete
was
whistling
or
was
chaffing
with
the
waiters
he
told
her
a
few
words
at
a
time
of
the
new
work
macbride
had
assigned
to
him
and
in
his
enthusiasm
he
gave
her
a
little
idea
of
what
it
would
mean
to
him
this
opportunity
to
build
an
elevator
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
seen
in
the
country
before
and
which
would
be
watched
by
engineers
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
he
told
her
too
something
about
the
work
how
it
had
been
discovered
that
piles
could
be
made
of
concrete
and
driven
into
the
ground
with
a
pile
driver
and
that
neither
beams
nor
girders
none
of
the
timbers
in
fact
were
needed
in
this
new
construction
he
was
nearly
through
with
it
and
still
he
did
not
notice
the
uncertain
expression
in
her
eyes
it
was
not
until
she
asked
in
a
faltering
undertone
when
are
you
going
to
begin
that
it
came
to
him
and
then
he
looked
at
her
so
long
that
pete
began
to
notice
and
she
had
to
touch
his
foot
with
hers
under
the
table
to
get
him
to
turn
away
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
vacation
and
the
lawrence
trip
hilda
saw
in
her
side
glances
the
gloomy
expression
that
had
settled
upon
his
face
and
she
recovered
her
spirits
first
it
all
right
she
whispered
i
do
care
max
came
up
then
from
a
talk
with
james
out
on
the
stairway
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
no
chance
to
reply
but
after
bannon
had
caught
max
signals
to
step
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
and
before
he
had
risen
there
was
a
moment
when
pete
attention
was
drawn
by
one
of
the
waiters
and
he
said
can
you
go
with
me
monday
she
looked
frightened
and
the
blood
rose
in
her
cheeks
so
that
she
had
to
bend
low
over
her
pile
of
napkins
will
you
he
was
pushing
back
his
chair
she
did
not
look
up
but
her
head
nodded
once
with
a
little
jerk
and
you
stay
for
the
dinner
wo
you
now
she
nodded
once
more
and
bannon
went
to
join
max
max
made
two
false
starts
before
he
could
get
his
words
out
in
the
proper
order
say
he
finally
said
i
thought
maybe
you
would
care
if
i
told
james
he
thinks
you
all
right
you
know
and
he
says
if
you
care
he
like
to
say
a
little
something
about
it
when
he
makes
his
speech
not
much
you
know
nothing
you
would
like
he
says
it
would
tickle
the
boys
right
down
to
their
corns
bannon
looked
around
toward
hilda
and
slowly
shook
his
head
max
he
replied
if
anybody
says
a
word
about
it
at
this
dinner
break
his
head
that
should
have
been
enough
but
when
james
turn
came
to
speak
after
nearly
two
hours
of
eating
and
singing
and
laughing
and
riotous
good
cheer
he
began
in
a
way
that
brought
bannon
eyes
quickly
upon
him
boys
he
said
we
worked
hard
together
on
this
job
and
one
way
and
another
we
come
to
understand
what
sort
of
a
man
our
boss
is
ai
that
right
a
roar
went
up
from
hundreds
of
throats
and
hilda
sitting
next
to
bannon
blushed
we
thought
we
understood
him
pretty
well
but
i
just
found
out
that
we
did
know
so
much
as
we
thought
we
did
he
been
a
pretty
square
friend
to
all
of
us
and
i
going
to
tell
you
something
give
you
a
chance
to
show
you
square
friends
of
his
too
he
paused
and
then
was
about
to
go
on
leaning
forward
with
both
hands
on
the
table
and
looking
straight
down
on
the
long
rows
of
bearded
faces
when
he
heard
a
slight
noise
behind
him
a
sudden
laugh
broke
out
and
before
he
could
turn
his
head
a
strong
hand
fell
on
each
shoulder
and
he
went
back
into
his
chair
with
a
bump
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
bannon
standing
over
him
the
boss
was
trying
to
speak
but
he
had
to
wait
a
full
minute
before
he
could
make
himself
heard
he
glanced
around
and
saw
the
look
of
appeal
in
hilda
eyes
look
here
boys
he
said
when
the
room
had
grown
quiet
we
handing
out
any
soft
soap
at
this
dinner
i
wo
let
this
man
up
till
he
promises
to
quit
talking
about
me
there
was
another
burst
of
laughter
and
james
shouted
something
that
nobody
understood
bannon
looked
down
at
him
and
said
quietly
and
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
very
firmly
if
you
try
that
again
i
throw
you
out
of
the
window
james
protested
and
was
allowed
to
get
up
bannon
slipped
into
his
seat
by
hilda
it
all
right
he
said
in
a
low
tone
they
wo
know
it
now
until
we
get
out
of
here
his
hand
groped
for
hers
under
the
table
james
was
irrepressible
he
was
shouting
quickly
now
in
order
to
get
the
words
out
before
bannon
could
reach
him
again
how
about
this
boys
shall
we
stand
it
no
was
the
reply
in
chorus
all
right
then
three
cheers
for
bannon
now
hip
hip
there
was
no
stopping
that
response
