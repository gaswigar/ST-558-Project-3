chapter
i
beautiful
golden
glenalvan
stood
by
the
lake
and
looked
into
its
azure
depths
with
a
dreamy
light
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
singing
as
she
danced
along
the
sunny
path
but
the
sweet
song
died
on
the
coral
lips
as
she
came
to
the
little
lake
with
its
green
fringe
of
willows
and
the
white
lilies
sleeping
on
its
breast
the
wind
as
it
sighed
through
the
trees
and
the
low
soft
ripple
of
the
water
always
sounded
sad
to
golden
it
seemed
to
her
vivid
fancy
that
the
wind
and
the
waves
were
trying
to
tell
her
some
sad
story
in
a
language
she
could
not
understand
she
was
unconsciously
saddened
whenever
she
came
to
its
banks
and
listened
to
the
low
soft
murmur
it
had
a
tragic
story
to
tell
her
indeed
but
its
language
was
too
mysterious
for
her
to
understand
some
day
she
would
know
the
afternoon
sunshine
threw
the
long
slanting
shadows
of
old
glenalvan
hall
far
across
the
level
greensward
almost
to
the
border
of
the
lake
it
had
once
been
a
fine
and
stately
mansion
picturesque
and
pretentious
with
many
peaks
and
gables
and
oriel
windows
but
its
ancient
glory
had
long
departed
it
seemed
little
more
than
a
picturesque
ruin
now
but
there
still
remained
in
one
wing
a
few
habitable
apartments
that
were
fine
and
large
and
lofty
here
the
last
of
the
glenalvans
once
a
proud
and
wealthy
race
dwelt
in
respectable
poverty
but
poverty
did
not
seem
to
have
hurt
lovely
little
golden
glenalvan
she
had
a
wealth
of
beauty
and
a
happy
heart
that
made
her
seem
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
the
home
she
brightened
she
was
a
careless
willful
child
not
yet
sixteen
the
plain
simple
blue
gingham
dress
was
worn
quite
short
yet
the
beautiful
golden
tresses
fell
to
her
waist
in
long
loose
childish
ringlets
free
and
careless
as
the
birds
she
roamed
at
will
through
the
wild
neglected
park
and
the
green
woods
that
lay
around
her
ancestral
home
the
dwellers
in
glenalvan
hall
were
divided
into
two
families
in
the
best
and
most
habitable
part
john
glenalvan
lived
with
his
wife
and
family
consisting
of
two
daughters
and
a
son
in
a
few
battered
rooms
in
the
wing
john
glenalvan
father
an
old
and
man
kept
house
with
his
pretty
little
granddaughter
golden
and
one
old
black
servant
called
dinah
we
have
digressed
a
little
from
golden
as
she
stands
beside
the
lake
swinging
her
wide
straw
hat
by
its
blue
ribbons
let
us
return
the
little
maiden
is
communing
with
herself
quite
unconsciously
she
speaks
her
thoughts
aloud
old
dinah
says
that
elinor
and
clare
will
give
a
little
party
in
honor
of
their
brother
wealthy
friend
who
is
to
come
on
a
visit
to
him
how
i
wish
they
would
invite
me
i
should
like
to
go
should
you
now
really
said
a
slightly
sarcastic
voice
close
to
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
her
cousin
elinor
coming
along
the
path
toward
her
elinor
glenalvan
was
a
tall
and
queenly
beauty
of
the
most
pronounced
brunette
type
she
had
large
black
eyes
that
sparkled
like
diamonds
and
glossy
black
hair
braided
into
a
coronet
on
the
top
of
her
haughty
head
her
features
were
and
regular
her
skin
a
clear
olive
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
a
rich
glowing
crimson
she
was
years
old
and
her
sister
clare
who
walked
by
her
side
was
nineteen
clare
glenalvan
was
a
weak
vain
pretty
girl
but
with
no
such
decided
claim
to
beauty
as
elinor
her
hair
and
eyes
were
not
as
dark
as
her
sister
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
less
rosy
she
had
a
mincing
affected
air
but
was
considered
stylish
and
elegant
both
girls
were
attired
in
the
best
their
father
could
afford
from
his
very
limited
income
and
their
little
cousin
simple
blue
gingham
looked
plain
indeed
by
contrast
with
their
cool
lawns
and
lace
ruffles
elinor
carried
a
small
basket
on
her
arm
they
had
come
to
the
lake
for
to
decorate
the
rooms
for
the
party
of
which
they
had
caught
golden
talking
aloud
the
little
girl
blushed
at
her
dilemma
a
moment
then
she
faced
the
occasion
bravely
i
did
not
know
that
you
could
hear
me
elinor
she
said
lifting
her
beautiful
frank
blue
eyes
to
her
cousin
face
but
it
is
true
i
should
like
to
come
to
your
party
you
have
invited
grandpa
old
servant
to
come
and
help
with
the
supper
and
she
will
go
why
do
you
not
ask
grandpa
and
me
grandpa
is
too
old
to
come
and
you
are
too
young
replied
elinor
with
a
careless
flippant
laugh
while
clare
stared
at
golden
and
murmured
audibly
the
bold
little
thing
golden
revolved
her
cousin
reply
a
moment
in
her
mind
well
perhaps
he
is
too
old
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
and
yet
i
think
he
might
enjoy
seeing
the
young
people
amusing
themselves
but
as
for
me
elinor
i
know
i
am
not
too
young
minnie
edwards
is
coming
i
have
heard
and
she
is
a
month
younger
than
i
am
the
only
difference
is
that
puts
up
her
hair
and
wears
long
dresses
i
would
wear
long
dresses
too
only
i
do
not
believe
grandpa
could
afford
it
it
would
take
several
yards
more
for
a
trail
or
even
to
touch
all
around
clare
and
elinor
laughed
heartlessly
at
the
wistful
calculation
of
the
difference
between
short
and
long
dresses
then
the
elder
sister
said
abruptly
it
is
a
great
pity
grandpa
can
not
keep
you
a
little
girl
in
short
dresses
forever
golden
you
will
not
find
it
very
pleasant
to
be
a
woman
why
not
said
innocent
golden
are
not
women
happy
some
are
said
elinor
but
i
do
not
think
will
ever
be
why
not
asked
the
girl
again
the
two
sisters
exchanged
significant
glances
that
did
not
escape
golden
keen
eyes
elinor
why
do
you
and
clare
look
at
each
other
so
hatefully
she
cried
out
in
sudden
resentment
and
childish
passion
what
is
the
matter
what
have
i
done
you
have
done
nothing
except
to
be
born
said
clare
glenalvan
irritably
and
under
the
circumstances
is
the
worst
thing
you
done
was
it
only
the
fancy
of
beautiful
golden
or
did
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
grasses
sigh
mournfully
and
the
blue
waves
go
lapsing
past
with
a
sadder
tone
clare
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
cried
i
never
harmed
anyone
in
my
life
i
have
not
hurt
anyone
by
being
born
have
i
the
sisters
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
with
its
rose
flushed
cheeks
and
flashing
violet
eyes
and
elinor
sneered
rudely
while
clare
answered
in
a
sharp
complaining
voice
yes
you
have
hurt
every
soul
that
bears
the
name
of
glenalvan
the
dead
glenalvans
as
well
as
the
living
ones
you
are
a
living
disgrace
to
the
proud
old
name
that
your
mother
was
the
first
to
disgrace
then
she
paused
a
little
frightened
for
golden
had
started
so
violently
that
she
had
almost
fallen
backward
into
the
lake
she
steadied
herself
by
catching
the
branch
of
a
bending
willow
and
looked
at
her
cousin
with
lips
and
cheeks
and
scornful
eyes
clare
you
are
a
cruel
wicked
girl
she
cried
i
will
go
and
tell
grandpa
what
terrible
things
you
have
said
of
me
i
did
not
believe
one
word
the
tears
of
wounded
pride
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
as
she
sped
along
the
path
and
across
the
green
lawn
up
to
the
old
hall
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
a
little
disconcerted
clare
you
were
too
hasty
said
elinor
uneasily
grandpa
will
be
very
angry
chapter
ii
little
golden
sped
across
the
green
lawn
her
young
heart
full
of
pain
and
anger
at
the
cruel
words
her
cousins
had
spoken
to
her
flying
through
the
long
dark
corridor
of
the
old
hall
and
passing
through
several
lofty
and
empty
old
rooms
she
emerged
at
last
in
the
sunny
where
her
grandfather
dozed
daily
surrounded
by
pots
of
fragrant
roses
and
geraniums
but
with
the
breathless
words
of
complaint
just
parting
her
coral
lips
golden
saw
that
the
old
was
vacant
she
was
surprised
and
a
little
dismayed
she
had
been
so
sure
of
finding
him
there
she
turned
round
and
ran
out
to
the
sunny
kitchen
in
the
back
yard
where
old
dinah
stood
at
a
table
ironing
some
simple
white
garments
for
her
young
mistress
and
crooning
to
herself
a
fragment
of
a
negro
revival
tune
the
only
nurse
and
the
best
friend
that
golden
had
ever
known
after
her
grandfather
was
homely
black
dinah
golden
loved
the
old
negress
dearly
ever
since
she
had
first
lisped
her
name
the
girl
had
familiarly
called
her
black
mammy
after
the
fashion
of
most
southern
children
with
their
nurses
now
she
called
out
quickly
before
she
had
reached
the
kitchen
door
oh
black
mammy
where
is
grandpa
black
mammy
turned
with
such
a
start
that
she
dropped
the
she
was
wielding
with
such
consummate
skill
oh
honey
chile
how
you
skeered
me
she
cried
an
i
dropped
de
and
burnt
my
black
toes
off
what
for
did
ye
come
callin
me
so
suddent
where
is
grandpa
repeated
the
child
she
came
up
to
the
door
and
looked
at
dinah
and
the
old
woman
saw
how
pale
she
was
and
what
a
strange
light
gleamed
in
the
violet
eyes
under
their
long
curling
lashes
of
come
dearie
do
be
afeard
because
de
old
man
ai
in
his
as
usual
he
out
wif
his
son
uncle
john
asked
little
golden
with
a
wondering
look
who
else
honey
said
dinah
as
she
vigorously
rubbed
a
fresh
iron
with
salt
and
beeswax
it
is
so
strange
said
golden
momentarily
diverted
from
her
immediate
grievance
by
dinah
news
uncle
john
comes
so
seldom
what
did
he
want
black
mammy
want
de
debbil
his
best
friend
knows
better
dan
your
poor
ole
black
mammy
said
dinah
shaking
her
head
all
i
know
is
dat
he
come
looking
black
as
a
and
ax
ole
massa
to
take
a
walk
with
him
and
he
went
said
golden
oh
yes
he
went
pore
ole
soul
off
as
sweet
as
a
lamb
with
that
snake
in
the
grass
oh
black
mammy
grandpa
would
not
like
you
to
speak
that
way
of
his
son
cried
golden
i
axes
your
pardon
honey
i
spoke
my
mind
afore
i
thought
answered
dinah
there
is
no
offense
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
replied
her
young
mistress
readily
there
is
no
love
lost
between
my
uncle
and
me
then
she
added
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
will
they
be
long
gone
do
you
think
i
has
the
leastest
idea
said
busy
dinah
but
ole
massa
is
too
feeble
to
walk
very
fur
golden
turned
away
silently
and
went
to
her
grandfather
nook
in
the
to
await
his
return
she
was
burning
with
impatience
to
tell
him
the
cruel
and
unkind
things
her
cousins
had
said
to
her
and
to
ask
if
they
were
true
she
sat
down
in
the
old
among
the
blossoming
flowers
herself
the
fairest
flower
of
all
and
leaning
her
dimpled
cheek
on
her
hand
relapsed
into
troubled
thought
the
strange
relations
sustained
by
her
grandfather
and
herself
toward
his
son
family
puzzled
her
as
it
had
often
done
before
living
in
the
same
house
and
nearly
related
as
they
were
there
was
little
or
no
intercourse
between
the
two
families
and
they
were
barely
friendly
ever
since
golden
could
remember
it
had
been
so
she
had
questioned
her
grandfather
and
she
had
questioned
dinah
but
they
gave
her
no
satisfaction
on
the
subject
it
remained
a
pregnant
mystery
to
the
lonely
child
living
her
thoughtless
girlish
life
in
the
ruined
rooms
of
the
western
wing
and
in
the
tangled
gardens
and
the
wild
green
wood
a
brief
time
of
impatient
waiting
then
golden
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
beneath
the
window
she
leaned
her
curly
head
out
and
heard
one
sentence
spoken
in
the
clear
curt
voice
of
john
glenalvan
you
understand
now
father
how
important
it
is
to
us
that
you
should
keep
golden
daughter
more
carefully
secluded
the
child
will
fret
she
has
been
so
used
to
an
outdoor
life
it
will
injure
her
health
feebly
objected
the
old
man
her
health
is
the
poorest
objection
you
could
urge
with
me
said
john
glenalvan
cruelly
if
she
had
died
long
ago
it
would
have
been
the
very
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
for
us
all
the
father
reply
was
lost
in
the
distance
as
they
passed
on
they
came
in
at
the
front
door
passed
down
the
long
corridor
and
separated
to
their
divided
abodes
golden
grandfather
came
heavily
into
the
quiet
leaning
on
his
oaken
cane
and
sought
his
favorite
chair
at
the
sunny
window
where
the
flowers
bloomed
and
the
butterflies
hovered
he
was
not
prepared
to
see
golden
start
up
from
the
chair
with
a
white
face
and
wild
frightened
blue
eyes
she
clutched
his
arms
and
leaned
against
him
he
felt
her
frightened
plainly
oh
grandpa
grandpa
she
wailed
what
is
the
matter
with
everyone
what
have
i
done
that
some
wish
me
dead
and
others
are
sorry
that
ever
i
was
born
she
felt
the
tremulous
lips
of
the
old
man
pressed
fondly
on
her
drooping
head
she
heard
a
sorrowful
murmur
poor
little
golden
daughter
then
he
said
aloud
my
darling
who
has
been
saying
such
cruel
things
to
you
it
is
clare
and
elinor
and
uncle
john
she
sobbed
they
the
girls
i
mean
now
said
the
worst
thing
i
could
have
done
was
to
be
born
and
that
my
mother
was
the
first
to
disgrace
the
name
of
glenalvan
and
grandpa
i
heard
what
uncle
john
said
when
he
passed
under
the
window
he
said
if
i
had
died
long
ago
it
must
have
been
better
for
all
old
hugh
glenalvan
kindly
blue
eyes
were
flashing
fire
he
held
the
quivering
little
form
against
his
breast
with
loving
arms
and
his
outraged
old
heart
beat
fast
against
the
girl
but
he
could
not
answer
her
indignant
pain
and
grief
kept
him
dumb
grandpa
tell
me
what
i
have
done
to
be
hated
by
my
kind
she
sobbed
am
i
deformed
am
i
repulsive
to
look
at
my
darling
you
are
as
perfect
and
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
he
answered
fondly
kissing
the
fair
innocent
brow
why
do
they
hate
me
then
she
wailed
i
would
love
them
all
if
they
would
let
me
they
are
cruel
and
heartless
if
they
were
not
they
could
not
help
but
love
you
my
golden
said
the
old
man
bitterly
then
he
sat
down
and
drew
her
to
a
seat
upon
his
knee
think
no
more
of
them
my
darling
he
said
brushing
away
the
shining
pearls
of
grief
that
hung
trembling
on
her
thick
lashes
they
are
cruel
and
unjust
to
you
keep
away
from
their
presence
and
forget
that
the
same
strain
of
blood
flows
in
your
veins
look
upon
them
as
aliens
and
strangers
give
all
your
love
to
me
she
hid
her
sweet
face
against
his
shoulder
her
breast
heaving
with
the
sobs
that
she
could
not
repress
i
have
a
heart
full
of
love
she
sighed
and
it
is
all
your
own
dear
grandpa
but
tell
me
oh
tell
me
of
my
mother
can
it
be
true
she
did
not
oh
she
could
not
disgrace
our
proud
old
name
hush
golden
you
torture
me
the
old
man
said
hoarsely
there
is
a
mystery
surrounding
you
my
little
one
your
history
is
a
sad
one
but
you
shall
never
know
it
if
i
can
keep
the
blighting
secret
from
your
knowledge
ask
me
no
more
my
darling
dismiss
it
from
your
thoughts
you
have
always
been
happy
heretofore
be
happy
still
you
are
innocent
pure
and
beautiful
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
have
a
quiet
happy
life
if
you
will
keep
away
from
those
who
wound
you
with
their
cruel
words
and
cling
closely
to
your
simple
peaceful
home
her
wild
sobs
had
ceased
she
was
looking
earnestly
into
his
face
while
long
low
sighs
quivered
over
her
lips
now
listen
to
me
golden
he
said
your
uncle
has
made
a
hard
request
of
me
darling
but
i
have
promised
that
it
shall
be
done
golden
will
you
trust
me
and
help
me
to
keep
my
word
is
it
about
me
she
said
yes
dear
you
know
the
three
upper
chambers
which
foolish
people
believe
to
be
haunted
golden
yes
she
said
and
he
saw
a
slight
quiver
pass
over
the
delicate
lips
and
her
face
grew
pale
of
course
you
know
that
is
all
nonsense
little
one
he
said
reassuringly
there
are
no
ghosts
in
glenalvan
hall
it
is
only
foolish
and
superstitious
people
who
believe
that
silly
tale
golden
would
you
be
willing
to
remain
secluded
in
those
haunted
rooms
for
one
week
or
for
whatever
number
of
days
john
glenalvan
expected
guest
shall
remain
the
breath
came
a
little
faster
over
the
beautiful
parted
lips
i
am
almost
afraid
she
sighed
oh
grandpa
why
should
they
wish
to
hide
me
away
like
a
criminal
i
have
done
nothing
i
know
that
dear
it
is
a
heartless
whim
of
those
heartless
people
they
do
not
wish
their
guest
to
see
you
or
even
to
know
of
your
existence
do
not
mind
them
pet
perhaps
they
are
jealous
and
fear
that
he
might
fall
in
love
with
you
that
would
never
do
because
they
mean
to
marry
him
to
elinor
and
prop
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
glenalvans
you
will
humor
their
fancy
wo
you
golden
the
eyes
flashed
with
resentful
fire
why
should
i
humor
them
she
cried
they
are
hard
and
cold
to
me
why
should
i
shut
myself
up
in
prison
away
from
the
sunshine
and
the
flowers
and
the
birds
in
those
gloomy
haunted
chambers
for
their
sake
it
is
for
sake
darling
he
replied
i
have
promised
them
that
you
will
do
it
for
me
will
you
not
do
so
golden
i
am
afraid
of
the
haunted
rooms
grandpa
said
the
child
with
a
shiver
not
in
the
daylight
i
hope
he
said
no
not
in
the
daytime
she
replied
old
dinah
could
sleep
in
your
room
at
night
golden
so
you
see
there
could
be
nothing
to
fear
my
little
darling
i
have
loved
you
and
cared
for
you
all
your
life
and
i
have
never
asked
you
for
a
sacrifice
before
will
you
make
this
concession
for
my
sake
the
beautiful
girl
clasped
her
white
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
his
withered
cheek
i
can
not
refuse
if
it
is
for
your
sake
grandpa
she
said
you
have
been
father
mother
friends
and
home
to
me
all
my
life
i
have
had
no
one
but
you
grandpa
and
i
love
you
too
dearly
to
grieve
you
i
will
do
as
you
wish
me
he
kissed
her
and
thanked
her
many
times
you
must
believe
that
it
hurts
me
as
much
as
it
does
you
my
pet
he
said
but
it
will
not
be
for
long
and
john
is
so
violent
i
had
to
promise
for
the
sake
of
peace
i
hope
you
will
never
regret
this
sweet
yielding
to
my
will
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
said
the
girl
but
she
gave
an
unconscious
shudder
his
hands
rested
as
if
in
blessing
on
her
hair
he
whispered
inaudibly
god
bless
my
hapless
daughter
child
chapter
iii
glenalvan
hall
like
all
old
family
mansions
belonging
to
old
and
respectable
families
had
its
reputed
ghost
it
was
currently
reported
that
three
rooms
in
the
upper
story
were
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
a
fair
young
girl
who
had
once
inhabited
them
and
who
had
pined
away
and
died
for
love
of
a
handsome
man
who
had
not
known
of
her
love
nor
reciprocated
it
this
fair
ancestress
of
golden
erma
glenalvan
as
she
was
called
was
said
to
haunt
the
suite
of
rooms
she
had
occupied
in
life
and
credulous
people
believed
that
on
moonlight
nights
she
walked
up
and
down
weeping
and
sighing
and
wringing
her
white
hands
because
her
spirit
could
not
retain
its
grave
it
was
to
these
gloomy
and
dismantled
rooms
haunted
by
the
restless
ghost
of
an
unhappy
girl
that
little
golden
was
consigned
for
a
week
or
more
by
the
stern
desire
of
john
glenalvan
it
was
a
hard
trial
to
the
child
she
would
not
have
consented
to
it
but
for
the
pleadings
of
her
grandfather
her
love
and
gratitude
to
him
made
her
yield
an
easy
consent
to
his
prayer
while
she
inwardly
quaked
with
fear
at
the
dread
ordeal
before
her
old
dinah
was
desired
by
her
master
to
transfer
suitable
bedding
and
furniture
to
the
room
golden
would
occupy
and
to
carry
her
meals
to
that
room
daily
and
attend
carefully
on
her
young
mistress
black
dinah
was
furious
i
know
dar
was
deviltry
afoot
she
said
i
know
it
john
glenalvan
never
sets
his
foot
in
ole
massa
presence
without
some
devil
broth
is
hush
dinah
old
hugh
said
sternly
you
must
not
speak
of
my
son
that
way
do
as
i
bid
you
no
harm
can
come
to
the
child
she
is
willing
to
the
plan
dinah
loud
complaints
subsided
into
muttering
and
grumbling
but
she
did
as
her
master
had
ordered
that
night
when
old
hugh
had
laid
his
gray
head
on
his
pillow
and
old
dinah
had
gone
into
the
other
wing
of
the
hall
little
golden
sat
down
to
read
in
the
chamber
where
erma
glenalvan
loving
heart
had
broken
for
a
hopeless
love
through
the
weird
stillness
and
solitude
of
the
haunted
room
the
sound
of
the
gay
dance
music
came
to
golden
ears
softened
and
mellowed
by
the
distance
the
little
maiden
heart
beat
faster
at
the
delicious
sound
so
inspiring
to
youthful
ears
she
threw
down
her
book
impatiently
how
sweet
it
sounds
she
said
they
are
in
the
great
i
should
like
to
see
them
how
cruel
my
cousins
are
to
me
the
sweet
lips
quivered
and
the
blue
eyes
darkened
with
anger
golden
was
a
spoiled
impetuous
child
her
grandpa
and
old
dinah
had
always
yielded
to
her
in
everything
and
placed
no
restraint
on
her
impetuous
temper
her
little
heart
was
swelling
bitterly
now
with
resentment
against
her
cruel
cousins
she
felt
their
neglect
and
their
insults
keenly
the
more
so
because
she
was
ignorant
of
any
possible
reason
for
their
contumely
i
should
like
to
spoil
their
party
for
them
the
little
creature
said
to
herself
with
a
passionate
vindictiveness
quite
unusual
with
her
i
have
a
great
mind
to
play
ghost
and
frighten
them
all
out
of
the
it
would
not
be
a
bit
too
bad
for
them
after
their
meanness
to
me
she
had
heard
old
dinah
say
that
clare
and
elinor
were
very
much
afraid
of
the
beautiful
phantom
of
glenalvan
hall
they
would
not
have
ventured
into
the
haunted
suite
alone
for
any
amount
of
money
clare
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
very
sight
of
the
ghost
would
be
sufficient
to
strike
her
dead
beautiful
golden
who
was
as
changeful
as
the
summer
breeze
began
to
laugh
at
the
mischievous
idea
which
had
occurred
to
her
what
a
fine
joke
it
would
be
to
personate
poor
erma
glenalvan
she
thought
how
clare
and
elinor
would
fly
from
the
festive
scene
when
i
appeared
weeping
and
wringing
my
hands
she
had
heard
the
ghost
described
by
dinah
who
averred
that
she
had
seen
it
several
times
she
remembered
the
long
white
robe
the
flowing
veil
of
golden
hair
the
pearl
necklace
the
wondrous
beauty
shining
as
old
dinah
declared
like
a
star
the
beauty
the
youth
the
veil
of
golden
hair
she
had
but
the
dress
and
the
pearls
where
should
she
find
them
an
old
wardrobe
which
had
once
belonged
no
doubt
to
the
erma
stood
against
the
wall
golden
pulled
the
door
open
not
without
some
little
fear
and
looked
in
at
the
collection
of
dresses
that
hung
on
the
pegs
she
could
not
tell
whom
they
belonged
to
for
she
had
never
looked
into
the
wardrobe
before
but
she
guessed
that
they
were
very
old
for
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
from
them
as
the
door
flew
open
and
as
she
touched
them
with
her
hand
some
of
the
folds
fell
into
rents
and
showed
how
long
they
had
been
the
prey
of
the
moth
but
as
golden
pulled
one
after
another
down
from
the
pegs
and
tossed
them
into
a
rainbow
heap
on
the
floor
she
came
to
one
at
last
that
would
serve
her
purpose
it
was
a
long
white
dress
of
rich
brocaded
silk
yellowed
by
time
antique
in
style
but
tolerably
golden
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
patting
her
little
foot
blithely
to
the
merry
measure
of
the
dance
music
the
very
thing
she
cried
and
then
she
shivered
slightly
perhaps
it
belonged
to
poor
erma
she
thought
but
in
a
few
minutes
golden
blue
gingham
lay
on
the
floor
and
she
had
slipped
into
the
old
brocade
and
hooked
it
together
it
fitted
her
perfectly
the
neck
was
low
and
finished
with
a
deep
frill
of
fine
old
yellow
lace
the
sleeves
were
short
and
the
dimpled
shoulders
and
beautifully
moulded
arms
were
exposed
to
the
greatest
advantage
golden
then
took
up
the
comb
and
brush
and
brushed
her
long
yellow
ringlets
out
of
curl
until
they
fell
about
her
slender
graceful
form
like
a
veil
of
summer
sunshine
if
i
only
had
the
pearls
now
i
might
readily
pass
for
the
phantom
she
said
looking
at
the
reflection
of
herself
in
the
glass
how
nice
i
look
this
dress
is
quite
becoming
i
declare
as
she
turned
round
admiring
the
long
soft
trailing
folds
of
the
brocade
something
rattled
in
what
appeared
to
be
the
region
of
the
pocket
golden
ran
her
slim
fingers
into
the
pocket
and
they
encountered
a
rent
between
the
lining
and
the
material
of
the
dress
following
the
rent
with
her
fingers
to
the
very
edge
of
the
skirt
they
encountered
something
which
she
drew
out
and
found
to
be
a
necklace
of
large
gleaming
pearls
golden
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
joy
as
she
clasped
the
beautiful
treasure
so
strangely
found
around
her
firm
white
throat
in
the
that
night
they
had
been
talking
of
the
glenalvan
ghost
elinor
or
clare
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
let
bertram
chesleigh
know
how
grand
and
wealthy
the
glenalvans
had
been
before
the
war
and
especially
they
had
been
pleased
to
have
him
hear
about
the
beautiful
phantom
of
the
girl
erma
who
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
though
they
were
afraid
of
her
and
would
not
have
willingly
beheld
her
for
anything
they
were
proud
of
the
of
a
family
ghost
they
considered
that
only
distinguished
families
ever
had
such
visitations
elinor
told
him
the
pretty
legend
she
had
heard
from
a
superstitious
old
servant
she
said
the
phantom
would
fly
if
anyone
approached
her
but
if
she
could
once
be
overtaken
and
kissed
by
a
very
handsome
man
she
would
rest
in
her
grave
and
walk
no
more
but
it
was
confidently
asserted
that
no
one
could
accomplish
such
a
feat
for
the
phantom
flew
before
every
pursuer
as
if
fear
lent
it
wings
if
you
could
catch
and
kiss
her
chesleigh
i
think
the
ghost
would
be
forever
laid
said
clare
glenalvan
with
a
simper
and
affected
laugh
thank
you
miss
clare
said
bertram
chesleigh
with
a
bow
though
he
was
inwardly
disgusted
he
knew
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
his
mirror
had
told
him
so
but
he
did
not
admire
clare
forwardness
in
telling
him
of
it
so
plainly
the
merry
dance
went
on
the
subject
of
the
glenalvan
ghost
had
passed
from
the
minds
of
the
dancers
when
suddenly
the
music
which
had
been
filling
the
air
with
sweetness
came
to
a
dead
stop
all
the
dancers
looked
toward
the
door
where
the
band
was
stationed
for
the
cause
of
the
silence
the
performers
had
dropped
their
instruments
and
were
staring
at
a
vision
in
the
wide
open
doorway
that
opened
from
a
long
dark
corridor
a
vision
clearly
outlined
against
the
outer
darkness
and
plainly
seen
by
all
in
the
room
a
girlish
form
in
sweeping
white
robes
and
falling
golden
hair
the
beautiful
face
convulsed
with
woe
and
pain
the
white
arms
extended
the
small
hands
clasping
and
unclasping
each
other
in
gestures
of
infinite
despair
the
glenalvan
ghost
ran
from
lip
to
lip
in
a
murmur
of
awe
and
terror
while
timid
young
girls
clung
shrieking
to
their
partners
and
the
utmost
confusion
prevailed
elinor
glenalvan
tried
to
faint
in
the
arms
of
bertram
chesleigh
but
he
put
her
hastily
into
a
chair
and
said
quickly
miss
glenalvan
i
am
going
to
earn
your
everlasting
gratitude
i
shall
kiss
the
beautiful
erma
and
the
glenalvan
ghost
will
be
forever
laid
he
sprang
toward
the
doorway
but
in
that
moment
the
beautiful
phantom
turned
and
fled
precipitately
before
him
chapter
iv
it
had
not
entered
into
little
golden
plan
for
the
discomfiture
of
her
scornful
cousins
that
anyone
would
have
the
temerity
to
approach
her
in
her
character
of
the
glenalvan
ghost
on
the
contrary
she
had
confidently
expected
to
spread
fear
dismay
and
confusion
among
the
festive
guests
and
to
effect
her
own
escape
unmolested
and
unsuspected
what
was
her
surprise
and
dismay
to
see
a
tall
dark
handsome
man
start
from
elinor
side
and
cross
the
room
toward
her
with
the
evident
purpose
of
accosting
her
beautiful
golden
was
filled
with
fear
and
alarm
she
turned
swiftly
and
fled
down
the
long
dark
corridor
her
heart
beating
with
dread
lest
she
should
be
overtaken
and
identified
by
her
pursuer
she
thought
of
her
grandfather
grief
and
mortification
if
he
should
find
out
her
girlish
prank
and
of
her
stern
uncle
wrathful
anger
these
swift
thoughts
seemed
to
lend
wings
to
her
light
feet
she
flew
rather
than
ran
down
the
dark
hall
but
her
rapid
could
not
drown
the
quick
and
steady
footsteps
of
her
pursuer
they
seemed
to
come
nearer
and
gain
upon
her
to
gain
her
own
rooms
in
the
western
wing
golden
would
be
compelled
to
go
up
a
wide
stairway
leading
directly
from
the
corridor
in
which
she
was
then
running
it
dawned
on
her
mind
in
the
whirl
of
thoughts
that
rushed
over
her
that
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
return
to
the
haunted
rooms
just
then
she
believed
that
she
would
undoubtedly
be
pursued
and
captured
if
she
did
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
best
plan
would
be
to
escape
into
the
open
air
and
hide
herself
in
the
belt
of
thick
dense
shrubbery
that
grew
below
the
lake
she
knew
every
bend
and
turn
and
secret
nook
within
it
her
pursuer
did
not
she
could
baffle
him
there
inspired
by
what
seemed
to
her
a
happy
thought
golden
flew
past
the
wide
staircase
and
gained
the
outer
door
she
flashed
down
the
marble
steps
outside
and
struck
breathlessly
across
the
green
lawn
but
swift
and
breathless
as
her
flight
had
been
she
had
a
worthy
of
her
steel
bertram
chesleigh
had
never
faltered
in
his
swift
pursuit
of
the
supposed
phantom
if
such
a
thing
were
indeed
possible
he
meant
to
capture
the
flying
form
and
kiss
the
face
whose
beauty
had
struck
him
even
through
its
tragic
expression
of
sorrow
and
despair
he
was
and
swift
and
inspired
by
the
novelty
of
the
chase
he
was
determined
to
keep
his
word
to
the
handsome
elinor
if
possible
he
went
over
the
marble
steps
at
one
flying
bound
that
gained
him
a
great
advantage
over
golden
as
he
followed
her
over
the
lawn
he
was
so
near
that
the
frightened
girl
could
hear
his
quick
panting
breath
and
dreaded
every
moment
to
feel
his
outstretched
hands
clutch
her
white
shoulder
it
was
a
lovely
night
the
moon
was
at
its
full
its
white
radiance
touched
everything
with
weird
beauty
it
shone
on
the
leaves
the
flowers
and
the
grass
and
made
the
glitter
like
diamonds
golden
white
brocade
shone
with
a
silvery
gleam
as
she
fled
through
the
moonlight
her
white
arms
and
neck
gleamed
like
ivory
through
the
golden
mist
of
her
streaming
hair
she
had
crossed
the
green
expanse
of
the
lawn
in
safety
her
light
feet
struck
into
the
path
by
the
lake
when
once
she
had
crossed
that
path
she
would
be
into
the
shrubbery
she
felt
sure
that
she
might
mislead
the
determined
follower
then
but
the
race
had
been
an
unequal
one
that
flying
leap
over
the
flight
of
marble
steps
had
decided
the
contest
in
the
man
favor
scarce
a
minute
more
and
the
dreaded
touch
fell
on
her
shoulder
two
strong
arms
were
passed
quickly
around
her
waist
her
head
was
drawn
back
against
a
manly
breast
and
to
golden
horror
and
consternation
she
felt
a
pair
of
warm
mustached
lips
pressed
fully
and
passionately
upon
her
own
lovely
erma
may
your
spirit
rest
in
peace
after
this
fond
kiss
of
love
he
cried
and
golden
trying
vainly
to
struggle
out
of
his
clasp
lifted
her
eyes
and
saw
a
dark
splendid
handsome
face
gazing
into
her
own
with
large
black
eyes
that
were
full
of
eager
admiration
and
sparkled
with
pleasant
excitement
let
me
go
she
cried
with
her
blue
eyes
full
of
angry
tears
let
me
go
how
dared
you
oh
how
dared
you
me
but
the
strong
arms
held
her
fast
although
bertram
chesleigh
began
to
realize
that
it
was
not
a
phantom
but
a
real
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
he
had
kissed
so
warmly
he
held
her
fast
and
looked
down
with
a
smile
into
the
girlish
face
that
was
so
very
beautiful
even
through
the
crimson
flush
of
anger
do
not
be
angry
he
said
you
should
be
glad
that
i
have
kissed
you
why
should
i
be
glad
she
demanded
in
a
sharp
imperious
little
voice
the
dark
eyes
of
little
golden
captor
sparkled
with
mirth
at
her
indignant
question
they
told
me
up
yonder
at
the
hall
he
replied
that
if
a
handsome
man
could
catch
and
kiss
the
glenalvan
ghost
its
wandering
spirit
would
be
laid
forever
do
you
think
that
you
can
rest
easy
in
your
grave
now
beautiful
erma
golden
wrenched
herself
from
his
clasp
but
he
still
held
her
so
tightly
by
one
hand
that
she
could
not
leave
him
she
looked
at
him
with
bright
eyes
in
which
anger
and
reluctant
mirth
were
strangely
blended
his
quaint
humor
was
infectious
do
you
think
yourself
so
very
handsome
sir
she
demanded
a
lady
told
me
so
this
evening
he
replied
unblushingly
one
must
always
take
a
lady
word
must
not
one
fair
erma
i
am
not
erma
she
replied
impetuously
i
am
only
golden
golden
what
a
beautiful
name
cried
golden
captor
golden
golden
glenalvan
she
replied
that
is
prettier
still
he
said
then
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
are
you
any
kin
to
clare
and
elinor
yes
we
are
cousins
the
girl
replied
frankly
she
forgot
how
strange
it
was
for
her
to
be
standing
there
talking
to
this
stranger
from
whom
she
had
been
desperately
fleeing
a
moment
ago
but
the
dark
mesmeric
eyes
held
her
gaze
with
a
luring
power
the
warm
soft
hand
that
clasped
her
own
sent
strange
thrills
of
tingling
sweetness
through
every
nerve
when
she
had
looked
at
the
dark
handsome
smiling
face
once
she
liked
to
look
at
it
again
she
forgot
to
feel
afraid
of
him
they
were
standing
on
the
border
of
the
lake
the
moonlight
made
it
shine
like
a
sheet
of
silver
but
bertram
chesleigh
had
no
eyes
for
its
beauty
while
the
fair
fresh
face
of
that
innocent
girl
was
lifted
to
his
he
said
to
himself
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
seen
anyone
half
so
lovely
and
you
are
not
a
ghost
after
all
he
said
no
i
was
only
masquerading
she
replied
i
did
it
to
frighten
my
cousins
and
spoil
their
party
do
you
think
i
have
succeeded
she
inquired
with
anxiety
he
looked
a
little
surprised
i
do
not
know
i
am
sure
he
said
why
did
you
wish
to
spoil
their
pleasure
because
they
would
not
invite
me
to
go
and
said
cruel
things
to
me
besides
answered
golden
with
a
heaving
breast
why
would
they
not
invite
you
he
inquired
more
surprised
than
ever
elinor
said
i
was
but
i
should
sooner
think
that
grandpa
guessed
the
true
reason
she
replied
with
innocent
frankness
what
did
grandpa
guess
he
inquired
they
were
afraid
for
uncle
john
rich
guest
to
see
me
they
mean
to
marry
him
to
elinor
she
replied
readily
and
without
a
suspicion
that
it
was
the
rich
guest
himself
who
held
her
small
hand
that
moment
so
warmly
and
tightly
in
his
own
bertram
chesleigh
laughed
long
and
merrily
and
the
little
girl
awoke
to
a
sense
of
her
imprudence
oh
i
should
not
have
talked
to
you
so
she
cried
they
will
be
very
angry
oh
please
do
tell
anyone
i
was
the
ghost
grandpa
would
scold
me
and
i
could
not
bear
that
at
that
moment
the
murmur
of
voices
and
laughter
was
borne
to
them
on
the
breeze
from
the
hall
door
your
friends
are
coming
to
look
for
you
she
cried
oh
let
go
my
hand
i
must
hide
myself
you
will
not
betray
my
secret
no
i
will
keep
it
faithfully
golden
he
replied
then
he
kissed
her
small
hand
and
released
her
for
he
did
not
wish
his
friends
to
find
him
with
her
she
darted
away
like
a
bird
and
hid
herself
in
the
shrubbery
the
young
man
lighted
a
cigar
and
turned
back
to
meet
his
friends
did
you
catch
the
ghost
did
you
kiss
her
they
asked
him
eagerly
i
was
never
so
outwitted
in
my
life
he
replied
would
you
believe
it
if
i
should
tell
you
that
i
pursued
her
across
the
lawn
to
the
border
of
the
lake
and
that
just
as
i
might
have
touched
her
with
my
hand
she
sprang
into
the
water
and
not
a
ripple
on
the
surface
showed
where
she
had
gone
down
this
clever
and
reply
was
accepted
as
a
statement
of
facts
by
the
credulous
the
romantic
story
spread
from
one
to
another
rapidly
bertram
chesleigh
found
himself
quite
a
hero
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
returned
to
the
house
but
though
they
praised
his
bravery
everyone
chaffed
him
because
he
had
failed
to
get
the
kiss
from
the
beautiful
phantom
chapter
father
where
is
golden
this
morning
old
hugh
glenalvan
looked
up
with
a
frightened
start
as
his
son
came
into
his
presence
with
a
stern
brow
and
heavy
footstep
it
was
the
morning
after
the
glenalvans
little
party
and
the
old
man
was
sitting
in
the
sunny
thinking
of
his
little
sunbeam
as
he
called
her
lovingly
in
his
thoughts
old
dinah
had
been
in
and
brought
him
a
message
to
say
that
she
was
very
lonely
and
wished
her
grandpa
to
come
and
see
her
and
bring
her
a
bunch
of
roses
he
was
just
thinking
of
doing
so
when
john
glenalvan
came
frowningly
into
his
presence
father
where
is
golden
this
morning
he
asked
sharply
and
the
old
man
trembled
with
fear
of
he
knew
not
what
as
he
replied
she
is
up
in
the
haunted
rooms
where
you
told
me
to
put
her
john
come
with
me
i
wish
to
see
her
he
said
and
the
old
man
face
grew
ashen
pale
as
he
asked
what
is
the
matter
has
golden
done
anything
john
you
will
know
soon
enough
was
the
short
reply
and
full
of
apprehension
the
old
man
led
the
way
to
his
granddaughter
room
beautiful
golden
was
walking
up
and
down
the
dreary
chamber
impatient
as
a
captive
bird
she
started
and
grew
very
pale
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
uncle
john
stern
face
she
did
not
speak
to
him
but
ran
up
to
her
grandfather
and
kissed
his
poor
old
wrinkled
cheek
dear
grandpa
she
said
i
am
very
lonely
i
miss
you
so
much
did
black
mammy
tell
you
to
bring
me
some
roses
yes
dear
but
i
did
not
have
the
time
said
the
grandfather
with
a
tremulous
voice
and
stealing
a
glance
at
his
son
for
some
inexplicable
reason
he
stood
in
great
fear
of
him
have
done
with
such
foolish
chat
girl
broke
in
john
glenalvan
roughly
so
you
played
the
ghost
last
night
eh
miss
golden
gave
a
violent
start
and
clung
to
her
grandfather
she
trembled
and
her
sweet
lips
grew
very
pale
you
need
not
deny
it
your
looks
betray
your
guilt
continued
john
glenalvan
roughly
no
no
my
golden
would
not
have
done
such
a
thing
cried
her
grandfather
warmly
who
says
that
she
did
golden
looked
anxiously
into
her
uncle
face
as
that
question
left
the
old
man
lips
her
heart
fell
at
the
thought
that
the
handsome
man
who
had
kissed
her
by
the
lake
had
betrayed
her
to
her
merciless
uncle
but
his
next
word
relieved
her
from
the
dread
i
say
so
myself
he
replied
i
saw
and
recognized
her
myself
as
did
clare
and
elinor
also
she
came
and
stood
in
the
hall
doorway
where
they
were
dancing
tricked
out
like
the
ghost
of
erma
glenalvan
deny
it
if
you
dare
miss
the
girl
quick
temper
flamed
up
at
his
harsh
manner
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
it
she
cried
defiantly
i
did
it
and
i
frightened
all
your
fine
company
too
i
am
very
glad
of
it
john
glenalvan
sprang
toward
her
with
upraised
hand
as
though
he
would
strike
her
but
she
stepped
quickly
out
of
his
reach
and
he
said
with
sullen
rage
you
hear
the
little
jezebel
father
take
care
take
care
that
i
do
not
put
my
threat
into
execution
john
she
is
but
a
playful
child
he
pleaded
pitifully
she
meant
no
harm
i
am
sure
oh
golden
my
darling
why
did
you
do
it
to
spite
the
girls
grandpa
for
their
cruelty
to
me
she
replied
but
i
am
very
sorry
now
since
it
has
grieved
you
so
believe
me
grandpa
i
did
not
think
you
would
ever
hear
of
it
can
you
forgive
me
she
pleaded
wistfully
you
must
ask
your
uncle
forgiveness
not
mine
my
dear
was
the
tremulous
reply
i
will
not
ask
his
pardon
she
replied
stoutly
her
blue
eyes
flashing
and
the
color
flaming
into
her
cheeks
i
am
sorry
to
have
displeased
you
grandpa
dear
but
i
do
not
in
the
least
care
for
anyone
else
whether
they
are
offended
or
not
where
did
you
get
the
fine
toggery
you
wore
last
night
demanded
john
glenalvan
his
fingers
tingling
with
the
impulse
to
slap
the
fair
defiant
face
that
is
no
concern
of
yours
she
replied
resentfully
tell
me
dear
whispered
old
hugh
intent
on
preserving
a
semblance
of
peace
if
it
were
possible
golden
threw
open
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
and
showed
him
the
brocade
which
looked
very
yellow
and
old
in
the
clear
light
of
day
she
had
a
necklace
of
pearls
around
her
neck
said
john
in
an
artful
aside
to
his
father
did
you
golden
asked
her
grandfather
golden
went
to
the
little
and
took
up
the
costly
necklace
which
john
glenalvan
instantly
snatched
from
her
hand
and
placed
in
his
pocket
golden
looked
at
him
tearful
dismayed
and
excessively
angry
give
them
back
to
me
she
cried
they
are
mine
i
found
them
indeed
i
did
grandpa
they
had
fallen
through
a
hole
in
the
pocket
of
the
dress
into
the
skirt
lining
they
are
mine
and
you
shall
give
them
back
to
me
uncle
john
i
will
show
you
whether
i
will
or
not
he
replied
the
necklace
belongs
to
me
everything
in
the
house
belongs
to
me
as
well
as
the
estate
itself
you
only
have
a
home
on
sufferance
here
take
care
that
you
do
not
lose
that
is
it
true
grandpa
asked
golden
and
the
old
man
nodded
sadly
john
glenalvan
took
down
the
white
brocade
and
carried
it
away
in
a
compact
bundle
under
his
arm
i
shall
take
this
away
he
said
to
make
sure
that
you
do
not
play
any
more
disgraceful
tricks
upon
us
i
depend
upon
you
father
to
see
that
she
keeps
to
this
room
and
behaves
herself
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
if
she
does
not
i
emphatically
assure
you
that
you
both
will
suffer
through
her
willfulness
and
disobedience
i
will
promise
for
her
said
the
old
man
putting
his
hand
over
golden
pouting
and
rebellious
mouth
she
will
not
be
naughty
any
more
see
that
she
keeps
the
promise
his
son
replied
sternly
as
he
turned
away
he
went
to
elinor
where
he
found
his
two
daughters
quarreling
over
bertram
chesleigh
i
tell
you
he
admires
me
the
most
exclaimed
the
elder
girl
angrily
just
as
her
father
threw
the
necklace
and
the
brocade
into
her
lap
and
said
triumphantly
here
is
the
finery
the
ghost
wore
my
dears
divide
it
between
you
the
brocade
was
thrown
down
in
disgust
but
a
pitched
battle
ensued
over
the
pearl
necklace
i
am
the
elder
and
i
am
determined
to
have
it
cried
elinor
resolutely
i
shall
have
it
myself
if
i
perish
in
the
effort
retorted
clare
a
wordy
war
ensued
from
which
john
glenalvan
to
whom
it
was
nothing
new
retreated
in
disgust
the
contest
was
ended
at
last
by
the
handsome
elinor
boxing
the
ears
of
her
sister
and
taking
possession
of
the
spoil
on
the
barbarous
principle
of
might
is
right
chapter
vi
did
i
dream
the
whole
thing
said
bertram
chesleigh
to
himself
or
was
it
indeed
only
a
ghost
that
i
kissed
on
the
border
of
the
lake
do
ghosts
have
warm
living
flesh
and
blood
and
balmy
lips
and
blushes
that
come
and
go
and
delicious
little
tempers
and
the
power
to
thrill
one
nerves
with
quivering
darts
of
fire
have
i
lost
my
heart
to
a
phantom
he
might
well
ask
himself
these
questions
a
day
and
night
had
gone
since
the
glenalvans
had
their
little
party
and
so
far
he
had
been
unable
to
learn
anything
at
all
concerning
the
beautiful
girl
whom
all
but
himself
believed
to
have
been
the
ghost
of
the
dead
erma
glenalvan
as
he
had
promised
to
keep
little
golden
secret
inviolate
he
could
of
course
make
no
opening
inquiries
but
his
little
careless
artful
speeches
and
innocent
inquiries
all
failed
of
effect
he
could
learn
nothing
of
the
maid
whose
beauty
and
grace
had
literally
carried
his
heart
by
storm
it
seemed
quite
plain
that
she
did
not
live
in
the
house
it
was
equally
certain
that
she
did
not
reside
in
the
neighborhood
for
his
friend
young
fred
glenalvan
had
often
assured
him
that
his
father
family
were
the
only
living
descendants
of
the
once
numerous
race
chesleigh
asked
himself
if
there
was
indeed
a
mystery
or
if
he
had
been
fooled
by
an
elfish
spirit
from
the
world
of
shadows
his
heart
and
his
reason
answered
in
the
negative
it
was
a
human
being
warm
breathing
living
whom
he
had
clasped
and
kissed
that
night
his
veins
tingled
with
electric
fire
at
the
remembrance
alone
in
his
room
the
second
night
after
his
rencontre
with
the
ghost
bertram
chesleigh
walked
up
and
down
restlessly
half
mad
with
himself
that
he
should
dwell
so
persistently
on
that
one
thought
yet
finding
it
so
dangerously
sweet
he
would
not
willingly
have
forgotten
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
really
lived
till
now
when
this
romantic
passion
for
the
beautiful
unknown
fired
his
heart
elinor
and
clare
had
been
very
much
frightened
at
the
appearance
of
the
family
ghost
they
talked
about
it
in
low
whispers
when
bertram
chesleigh
expressed
a
desire
to
visit
the
haunted
suite
of
rooms
they
expressed
themselves
as
horrified
and
declared
that
the
rooms
of
the
hapless
erma
had
been
walled
up
long
years
before
and
that
all
the
rooms
of
the
western
wing
were
in
such
a
ruinous
condition
that
it
was
exceedingly
dangerous
to
venture
there
at
all
they
declared
that
their
father
had
engaged
workmen
to
pull
down
the
western
wing
on
account
of
its
precarious
condition
but
singularly
enough
bertram
chesleigh
thoughts
were
running
on
the
haunted
rooms
almost
continuously
everything
connected
with
the
glenalvan
ghost
had
a
deep
interest
for
him
some
impulse
impelled
him
to
visit
the
western
wing
he
knew
that
the
wide
hall
on
which
his
room
door
opened
had
a
corridor
leading
from
it
into
the
ruined
western
wing
of
the
hall
some
impulse
stronger
than
his
will
some
spirit
in
his
feet
tempted
him
forth
under
cover
of
the
silence
and
the
night
to
explore
the
dangerous
region
in
the
vague
hope
of
finding
some
trace
of
the
mysterious
ghost
of
last
night
to
have
met
her
again
he
would
have
dared
even
more
threatening
dangers
than
the
settling
timbers
and
falling
roof
which
fred
and
clare
and
elinor
were
unanimous
in
declaring
menaced
everyone
who
entered
the
decaying
portion
of
the
hall
softly
shod
in
his
velvet
slippers
he
opened
the
door
and
peered
out
into
the
long
hall
it
was
lighted
by
long
windows
at
either
end
through
which
the
moonlight
poured
a
flood
of
white
radiance
putting
a
convenient
box
of
matches
into
the
pocket
of
his
he
sallied
boldly
forth
whether
ghost
or
human
he
longed
to
encounter
the
beautiful
girl
he
loved
again
he
entered
the
long
corridor
and
walked
along
softly
guided
by
the
moonlight
that
entered
through
the
windows
and
lay
in
fantastic
shadows
upon
the
floor
he
found
that
the
building
was
in
a
ruinous
condition
indeed
the
rooms
into
which
he
looked
were
dismantled
and
bare
the
papering
hung
in
ragged
fantastic
strips
from
the
walls
huge
rats
scampered
over
the
floor
frightened
flapped
against
the
windows
with
wild
unearthly
noises
surely
the
place
was
to
be
the
abode
of
ghosts
and
shadows
it
was
so
weird
and
uncanny
but
bertram
chesleigh
held
on
his
way
undauntedly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
explored
every
room
on
that
upper
floor
when
suddenly
he
discovered
a
little
passage
down
which
he
turned
and
found
himself
in
front
of
a
closed
door
the
majority
of
the
doors
had
stood
open
swinging
carelessly
on
their
hinges
the
midnight
explorer
did
not
know
why
his
heart
beat
so
strangely
when
he
stood
before
this
closed
one
he
turned
the
handle
noiselessly
and
entered
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
him
in
the
large
and
lofty
apartment
where
he
now
found
himself
a
dim
and
shaded
was
burning
thick
dark
curtains
shaded
the
windows
a
large
rug
covered
the
center
of
the
floor
a
low
white
stood
in
the
furthest
corner
draped
in
neat
and
spotless
white
then
the
midnight
explorer
started
and
with
difficulty
repressed
the
cry
that
rose
to
his
lips
for
the
soft
white
counterpane
thrown
over
the
bed
outlined
the
curves
of
an
exquisite
girlish
form
on
the
white
ruffled
pillow
nestled
a
sleeping
face
as
lovely
as
a
budding
rose
the
round
white
arms
were
thrown
carelessly
up
above
her
head
the
wealth
of
curling
golden
hair
strayed
in
rich
confusion
over
the
pillow
the
lashes
lay
softly
on
the
rosy
dimpled
cheeks
the
lips
were
smiling
as
if
some
happy
dream
stirred
the
white
breast
that
rose
and
fell
so
softly
over
the
innocent
heart
ghost
or
human
bertram
chesleigh
asked
himself
as
he
gazed
in
astonishment
and
ecstacy
at
the
beautiful
unconscious
sleeper
he
came
nearer
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
bated
breath
to
the
bedside
he
bent
so
near
that
he
could
hear
the
soft
sweet
breath
that
fluttered
over
the
parted
lips
it
is
she
he
said
to
himself
with
mingled
rapture
and
amaze
then
in
the
next
breath
he
murmured
i
must
beat
a
quiet
retreat
how
frightened
and
angry
she
would
be
were
she
to
awake
and
find
me
here
he
was
one
of
the
purest
and
most
honorable
minded
men
in
the
world
he
turned
to
go
but
could
not
tear
his
fascinated
eyes
from
that
beautiful
sleeping
face
his
splendid
black
eyes
lingered
on
its
innocent
beauty
in
passionate
admiration
if
i
might
only
touch
that
little
hand
that
lies
so
near
me
on
the
pillow
it
would
cool
the
thirst
of
my
heart
he
said
wistfully
to
himself
while
his
heart
beat
fast
with
joy
that
he
had
found
her
again
this
lovely
creature
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
night
and
day
for
hours
he
looked
at
the
parted
lips
and
his
pulses
thrilled
at
the
remembrance
of
the
tender
caress
he
had
pressed
upon
them
such
a
short
while
before
carried
away
by
the
force
of
as
pure
and
mad
a
passion
as
ever
thrilled
the
heart
of
man
the
enraptured
lover
bent
his
head
and
pressed
a
kiss
as
soft
and
light
as
the
fall
of
a
on
the
white
hand
that
lay
so
temptingly
near
him
he
meant
to
go
then
but
as
he
lifted
his
head
blushing
with
shame
at
the
temptation
that
had
prompted
him
to
that
wrongful
and
stolen
caress
a
sharp
indignant
voice
fell
on
his
ears
with
the
suddenness
of
a
oh
you
wilyun
you
wicked
betrayer
of
innercence
get
out
o
this
afore
i
kill
you
with
my
own
hands
you
debbil
bertram
chesleigh
turned
and
saw
a
ludicrous
yet
startling
sight
framed
in
the
open
doorway
of
an
inner
chamber
which
in
his
agitation
he
had
not
noticed
before
old
black
dinah
who
was
the
color
of
ebony
and
very
tall
and
lean
stood
before
him
clad
in
a
short
of
gay
striped
cotton
from
which
her
slim
legs
and
arms
stuck
out
like
her
stubbly
gray
wool
seemed
to
stand
erect
on
her
head
with
horror
and
her
brandished
arms
snapping
black
eyes
and
furious
face
made
up
a
startling
picture
of
wrath
and
horror
strangely
combined
with
the
ludicrous
you
wilyun
old
dinah
repeated
advancing
angrily
upon
her
dismayed
foe
get
out
o
de
room
o
my
innercent
lamb
afore
she
wakes
and
finds
you
here
you
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon
i
stumbled
into
this
room
by
the
merest
accident
chesleigh
was
beginning
to
say
when
startled
by
dinah
loud
and
angry
tones
little
golden
awoke
and
flashed
the
light
of
her
wide
blue
eyes
upon
their
excited
faces
she
uttered
a
cry
of
fear
and
terror
when
she
saw
the
tall
manly
form
standing
in
the
room
old
dinah
ran
to
her
instantly
and
she
hid
her
frightened
face
on
the
shoulder
of
the
old
black
woman
black
mammy
what
does
all
this
mean
cried
the
girl
nervously
dinah
gave
a
prolonged
and
lugubrious
groan
and
rolled
up
the
whites
of
her
eyes
in
reply
the
intruder
saw
that
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
stay
long
enough
to
explain
matters
to
the
alarmed
girl
he
said
to
himself
that
no
one
had
ever
been
placed
in
such
a
strange
and
embarrassing
position
before
every
instinct
of
delicacy
and
respect
for
the
young
girl
prompted
him
to
retire
at
once
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
go
and
leave
a
wrong
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
beautiful
girl
whom
he
admired
so
much
he
retreated
to
the
door
and
standing
there
said
anxiously
and
respectfully
i
entreat
you
to
believe
miss
glenalvan
that
i
entered
here
with
no
wrongful
motive
led
by
a
fit
of
curiosity
i
was
exploring
the
ruined
wing
of
the
hall
and
i
entered
without
a
dream
of
finding
it
occupied
by
any
living
being
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
these
rooms
were
totally
unoccupied
and
were
even
unsafe
to
enter
will
you
accept
my
apology
little
golden
head
was
still
hidden
against
dinah
shoulder
and
the
old
woman
broke
out
sharply
and
quickly
honey
chile
do
you
go
for
to
dat
wilyun
ef
he
done
really
cum
in
dis
room
by
accident
he
would
agone
out
when
he
found
dat
a
young
lady
occupied
de
room
but
no
de
first
sight
my
ole
brack
eyes
saw
when
i
jumped
off
my
pallet
and
come
to
de
door
was
dat
strange
man
you
my
precious
lamb
golden
began
to
sob
and
chesleigh
mentally
anathematized
the
old
woman
long
tongue
that
had
thus
betrayed
the
secret
he
had
intended
to
keep
so
carefully
his
face
grew
scarlet
as
he
hastened
to
say
i
kissed
your
hand
miss
glenalvan
and
i
entreat
your
pardon
for
yielding
to
that
overmastering
temptation
can
you
forgive
me
but
golden
was
still
weeping
bitterly
and
old
dinah
in
her
fear
and
indignation
for
her
darling
pointed
quickly
to
the
door
go
she
said
do
you
see
how
you
frighten
the
chile
by
staying
there
seemed
nothing
to
be
gained
by
staying
the
old
woman
was
utterly
unreasonable
and
golden
was
so
agitated
she
could
not
speak
the
embarrassed
intruder
silently
withdrew
to
his
own
apartment
where
he
spent
the
night
brooding
over
the
strange
discovery
he
had
made
and
the
unpleasant
position
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
chapter

resent
the
old
nurse
tone
of
authority
she
knew
the
old
woman
love
for
her
too
well
she
dried
her
eyes
and
reluctantly
related
her
escapade
two
nights
before
he
kept
my
secret
she
concluded
and
it
would
not
be
fair
for
us
to
make
trouble
for

would
it
black
mammy
old
dinah
had
slipped
down
to
the
floor
and
sat
with
her
long
black
arms
clasped
around
her
knees
looking
up
into
her
nursling
eager
fearful
face
with
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
her
keen
black
eyes
the
old
woman
was
shrewd
and
intelligent
in
her
way
she
foresaw
trouble
and
perhaps
the
bitterest
sorrow
from
these
two
meetings
between
the
handsome
guest
of
john
glenalvan
and
the
young

opened
wide
her

she
looked
very
lovely
as

leaned
back
among
the
snowy
ruffled
pillows
her
golden
hair
straying
loosely
about
her
shoulders
her
cheeks
tinted
with
a
deep
warm
blush
her
little

nervously
clasping

unclasping
each

golden
was
silent
a
moment
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
intently
after
a
moment
she
said
gravely
and
sadly

in

and
a

over

dinah

sighed
the
innocent
child
lifting
her
flushed
face
from

pillow
a
moment
to
fix
her
big
blue
imploring
eyes
on
the
old
woman
obdurate
face
yes

must
sartainly
promise
it
was
the
uncompromising
reply
there

silence
for

moment
and
dinah
saw
the
tears
come
into
the
sweet
blue
eyes
honey

she
inquired

silently
on
the
pillow
and
dinah
threw
down
a
quilt
on
the
floor
and
rolled
herself
in
it
she
was
soon
snoring
profoundly
not
so
with
beautiful
golden
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
to
sleep
again
she
shut
her
eyelids
resolutely
but
the
busy
beautiful
brain
was
too
active
to
admit
of
her
losing
consciousness
again
she
lay
thinking
of
the
splendid
stranger
he
has
kissed
me
twice
she
whispered
to
her
heart
and
yet
i
do
not
even
know
his
name
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
him
again
i
hope
i
shall
as
she
remembered
how
earnestly
he
had
apologized
for
his
presence
in
her
room
she
could
not
believe
him
the
wicked
villain
old
dinah
had
so
loudly
represented
him
he
is
handsome
and
i
believe
that
he
is
good
the
girl
said
to
herself
and
they
tell
me
elinor
wants
to
marry
him
i
would
like
to
marry
him
myself
just
to
spite
my
cousins
poor
little
golden
her
spite
against
her
cousins
was
almost
as
old
as
her
years
they
had
always
hated
her
and
golden
had
been
quick
to
find
it
out
and
resent
it
she
had
a
quick
and
fiery
temper
but
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
repent
of
her
little
fits
of
passion
she
was
a
bright
winsome
lovable
child
it
was
a
wonder
that
anyone
could
hate
her
for
her
beautiful
innocent
life
yet
there
were
those
who
did
and
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
vaguely
on
the
mind
of
the
girl
that
it
was
so
she
knew
that
her
life
was
passed
differently
from
that
of
the
other
girls
of
her
age
and
class
there
were
no
teachers
no
companions
no
pleasures
for
her
and
no
promise
of
any
change
in
the
future
she
wondered
a
little
why
it
was
so
but
she
never
complained
to
her
grandfather
it
was
perhaps
only
his
way
she
said
to
herself
little
dreaming
of
the
dark
mystery
that
lay
like
a
deep
impassible
gulf
between
her
and
the
dwellers
in
the
outside
world
of
which
she
knew
so
very
very
little
chapter
viii
a
week
elapsed
and
there
seemed
but
little
prospect
of
the
little
prisoner
release
from
the
haunted
chambers
of
the
ruined
wing
the
glenalvans
guest
lingered
on
fascinated
it
appeared
by
the
attractions
of
the
beautiful
elinor
at
least
elinor
stoutly
maintained
this
fact
in
the
privacy
of
the
family
circle
while
clare
as
obstinately
persisted
that
chesleigh
was
perfectly
impartial
in
his
attentions
to
both
but
however
doubtful
was
elinor
impression
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
pleased
with
his
visit
he
consented
by
their
urgent
invitation
to
prolong
his
stay
another
week
the
girls
were
jubilant
over
his
decision
meanwhile
old
dinah
watched
her
secluded
nursling
with
unremitting
vigilance
she
could
not
remain
with
her
all
day
because
her
housekeeping
duties
took
her
constantly
into
the
lower
part
of
the
house
but
she
visited
her
intermittently
and
at
night
rolled
herself
in
a
thick
counterpane
and
slept
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
couch
she
took
the
added
precaution
to
turn
the
rusty
key
in
the
lock
at
night
old
dinah
had
never
heard
the
familiar
adage
that
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
she
was
ordinarily
a
very
sound
and
healthy
sleeper
the
mere
accident
of
a
rheumatic
attack
and
consequent
sleeplessness
had
caused
her
appearance
the
night
chesleigh
had
entered
the
room
usually
she
might
have
been
lifted
counterpane
and
all
and
carried
away
bodily
without
being
aware
of
it
nearly
two
weeks
after
the
night
of
her
rencontre
with
chesleigh
old
dinah
awoke
suddenly
in
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the
night
seized
in
the
relentless
grip
of
her
old
enemy
the
rheumatism
she
rolled
herself
out
of
her
quilt
and
sat
upright
groaning
dolorously
and
rubbing
her
knees
in
which
the
pain
had
settled
oh
lordy
oh
lordy
she
groaned
how
my
ole
bones
does
ache
miss
golden
miss
golden
my
precious
lam
wake
up
and
bid
your
ole
brack
mammy

las
i
sartin
shuah
but
golden
usually
a
very
light
sleeper
made
no
reply
dinah
reared
her
woolly
head
upward
and
looked
into
the
bed
the
bed
was
then
dinah
looked
around
her
in
amazement
to
see
if
golden
was
not
in
the
room
laughing
at
her
lugubrious
groans
as
she
had
often
done
before
but
she
saw
no
trace
of
her
young
mistress
miss
golden
miss
golden
she
called
is
you
in
de
udder
room
ef
you
is
come
in
here
berry
sick
honey
almos
but
her
repeated
calls
elicited
no
reply
it
appeared
that
pretty
golden
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
suddenly
old
dinah
saw
the
dainty
white
ruffled
in
which
golden
had
retired
that
night
lying
in
a
snowy
heap
upon
the
floor
dinah
seized
upon
the
garment
and
shook
it
vigorously
as
if
she
expected
to
see
the
slight
form
of
her
young
mistress
drop
from
its
folds
to
the
floor
um
she
groaned

glanced
up
at
the
row
of
pegs
where
she
had
hung

articles
of
apparel

best
dress
a
cashmere

gone
also
her

and
a
summer
jacket

hab
runned
away
from
us
old
dinah
exclaimed
with
almost
a
howl
of
despair
the
thought
inspired
her
with
such
grief
and
terror
that
she
forgot
her
ailment
entirely
she
hobbled
out
from
the
room
and
made
her
way
down
stairs
to
her
master
apartment
and
burst
into
his
presence
a
ludicrous
object
indeed
in
her
striped
cotton

as

in

sat
in

before
an
old
carved
oaken
cabinet
one
quaint
little
drawer
was
open
and
the
old
man
was
poring
over
some
simple
treasures
he
had
taken
from
it
simple
treasures
yet
dearer
to
his
heart
than
gold
or
precious
stones
a
few
old
photographs
an
ambrotype
in
an
ebony
case
a
thin
gold
ring
and
some
locks
of

sad
and
touching
picture

and
tenderness

grotesque
figure
broke
startlingly
ole

ole

she
cried
wildly

with

the
old
man
swept
his
treasures
off
his
knees
into
the
quaint
cabinet
and
looked
at
his
old
servant
in
amazement
dinah
what
does
this
startling
intrusion
mean
he
inquired
pushing
his
spectacles
off
his
brow
and
regarding
her
with
a
mild
frown
little
golden
is
missing
she
hab
runned

wailed
the
old
negress
in
despair
chapter
ix
it
was
not
long
before
glenalvan
had
heard
the
whole
of
simple
from
his
servant
they
were
filled
with
horror
and
grief
at
its
too
probable
termination
dinah
it
may
be
that
she
has
stolen
out
into
the
grounds
for
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
she
was
growing
very
restless
with
the
close
indoor
confinement
have
you
thought
of
that
he
said
hoping
feebly
against
hope
shall
i
go
out
and
look
for
her
den
ole
massa
said
dinah
in
a
tone
that
plainly
betrayed
her
hopelessness
let
us
both
go
said
old
hugh
they
sallied
forth
anxiously
into
the
brilliant
moonlight
that
lay
in
silvery
brightness
all
over
the
sweet
southern
landscape
old
hugh
bareheaded
in
his
tattered
old
dinah
in
her
short
too
ridiculous
a
figure
for
anyone
to
contemplate
without
inward
mirth
it
so
happened
that
elinor
whom
the
hard
exigencies
of
poverty
compelled
to
be
her
own
dressmaker
had
sat
up
late
that
night
to
complete
some
alterations
in
a
dress
in
which
she
had
intended
to
array
her
fair
self
for
the
morrow
having
stitched
on
the
last
bit
of
lace
she
went
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
to
cool
her
heated
brow
my
head
aches
and
i
am
almost
melted
with
sewing
by
that
hot
lamp
she
said
to
herself
fretfully
how
i
hate
this
poverty
that
grinds
one
down
so
when
once
i
am
married
to
bertram
chesleigh
i
will
never
touch
a
needle
again
i
will
order
all
my
dresses
of
worth
of
paris
and
i
marry
bertram
chesleigh
i
swear
it
and
woe
be
to
anyone
that
tries
to
prevent
me
her
dark
eyes
flashed
luridly
a
moment
and
her
white
hand
was
angrily
clenched
she
was
thinking
of
clare
who
had
persisted
in
rivaling
her
with
chesleigh
at
that
moment
the
subdued
murmur
of
voices
floated
up
to
her
window
from
the
lawn
she
glanced
down
quickly
and
saw
old
dinah
and
her
master
crossing
the
lawn
their
grotesque
shadows
flying
long
and
dark
before
them
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
quick
as
thought
elinor
was
out
of
her
seat
and
gliding
softly
through
the
door
in
quest
of
her
father
before
old
glenalvan
and
his
servant
had
crossed
the
lawn
two
dark
figures
stole
forth
from
the
hall
and
silently
followed
them
on
the
green
border
of
the
silver
lake
two
figures
were
standing
in
the
beautiful
moonlight
one
was
a
man
tall
dark
splendid
with
a
princely
beauty
his
arm
was
thrown
protectingly
about
a
slender
form
that
clung
lovingly
to
his
side
it
was
golden
glenalvan
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
and
light
cloth
jacket
a
neat
little
set
jauntily
on
her
streaming
golden
curls
her
blue
eyes
were
lifted
tenderly
and
yet
anxiously
to
her
face
oh
bert
she
said
giving
him
the
tender
name
by
which
he
had
taught
her
to
call
him
you
must
indeed
let
me
go
now
we
have
been
saying
at
least
a
half
an
hour
parting
is
such
a
sweet
pain
said
the
lover
bending
to
kiss
the
tempting
lips
give
me
just
one
more
minute
my
darling
but
i
have
been
out
so
long
she
objected
faintly
what
if
black
mammy
should
awake
and
find
me
gone
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
said
bertram
chesleigh
carelessly
the
old
woman
sleeps
so
soundly
that
a
would
scarcely
wake
her
but
just
at
that
moment
of
his
fancied
security
old
dinah
in
deserted
chamber
was
vigorously
shaking
her
empty
in
a
dazed
attempt
to
evolve
from
its
snowy
folds
the
strangely
missing
girl
golden
smiled
then
sighed
faintly
he
kissed
her
lips
before
the
sigh
had
fairly
breathed
over
them
if
you
must
indeed
go
my
darling
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
freighted
with
passionate
tenderness
tell
me
once
again
my
little
golden
how
dearly
you
love
me
love
you
echoed
the
beautiful
girl
and
there
was
a
heaven
of
tenderness
in
the
starry
blue
eyes
she
raised
to
his
face
oh
my
dearest
if
i
talked
to
you
until
the
beautiful
sun
rose
i
could
not
put
my
love
into
words
it
is
deep
in
my
heart
and
nothing
but
death
can
ever
tear
it
thence
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
their
lips
met
in
a
long
passionate
kiss
there
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
soft
sigh
of
the
rippling
waves
while
they
stood
tranced
in
long
embraces
mixed
with
kisses
sweeter
sweeter
than
anything
on
earth
on
that
hush
of
exquisite
silence
that
brooded
round
them
broke
hastening
footsteps
and
angry
voices
the
lovers
started
back
from
each
other
in
dismay
to
find
themselves
surrounded
by
an
astonished
group
old
dinah
formed
a
central
and
conspicuous
figure
beyond
which
old
hugh
glenalvan
silvery
locks
fluttered
forlornly
in
the
breeze
john
glenalvan
and
elinor
his
daughter
brought
up
the
rear
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
and
his
servant
were
as
much
astonished
at
seeing
these
followers
as
they
were
at
the
sight
that
met
their
eyes
old
dinah
recovered
her
first
of
all
perhaps
because
she
had
vaguely
suspected
some
such
eclaircissement
from
the
facts
already
in
her
possession
she
rushed
forward
and
caught
her
disobedient
nursling
by
the
hand
oh
my
darlin
my
honey
chile
she
cried
come
away
from
dat
wilyun
to
your
grandpa
and
your
ole
brack
mammy
but
to
the
consternation
of
everybody
the
girl
shook
dinah
hand
off
and
clung
persistently
to
her
lover
he
drew
his
arm
protectingly
around
the
slight
figure
and
golden
cried
out
with
pretty
childish
defiance
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
and
i
will
not
leave
him
that
sight
and
those
words
fairly
maddened
elinor
glenalvan
the
blood
seemed
to
boil
in
her
veins
loves
you
ha
ha
loves
you
the
child
of
sin
and
shame
she
cried
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
of
bitter
scorn
and
passion
oh
yes
he
loves
you
that
is
why
he
has
lured
you
to
your
ruin
as
a
stranger
did
your
mother
before
you
hush
elinor
said
john
glenalvan
in
his
sternest
tone
then
he
looked
at
his
father
who
had
crept
to
golden
side
and
stood
there
trembling
and
speechless
father
he
said
harshly
take
the
girl
away
i
must
speak
with
chesleigh
alone
i
will
not
go
said
golden
and
she
looked
up
into
her
lover
face
with
a
strange
wistful
pleading
in
her
soft
blue
eyes
and
in
her
sweet
coaxing
lips
he
bent
down
and
whispered
something
that
made
her
leave
his
side
and
put
her
small
hand
gently
into
her
grandfather
grandpa
i
will
go
home
with
you
now
she
said
to
him
tremulously
and
he
led
her
away
followed
by
dinah
who
glared
angrily
behind
her
and
muttered
opprobrious
invectives
as
she
went
if
looks
could
have
killed
bertram
chesleigh
would
never
have
lived
to
figure
any
further
in
the
pages
of
my
romance
chapter
bertram
chesleigh
was
left
alone
by
the
lake
with
the
angry
eyes
of
john
glenalvan
glaring
upon
him
while
elinor
speechless
with
rage
stood
a
little
apart
and
watched
him
chesleigh
may
i
ask
the
meaning
of
this
singular
scene
inquired
his
host
stiffly
bertram
chesleigh
standing
with
folded
arms
in
dignified
silence
opened
his
lips
and
said
briefly
it
means
glenalvan
that
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
your
niece
and
fallen
in
love
with
her
a
threatening
flash
came
into
elinor
eyes
in
the
moonlight
she
bit
her
lips
fiercely
to
keep
back
the
words
that
rose
to
them
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
said
john
glenalvan
in
a
subdued
voice
inwardly
he
was
raging
with
anger
but
he
allowed
no
trace
of
it
to
escape
him
will
you
tell
me
where
and
how
you
became
acquainted
with
that
child
i
must
decline
to
do
so
said
the
young
man
firmly
john
glenalvan
looked
around
at
his
daughter
elinor
return
to
the
house
he
said
i
will
join
you
there
presently
elinor
walked
away
but
she
did
not
return
to
the
hall
as
her
father
had
commanded
instead
she
hid
herself
behind
a
clump
of
willows
where
she
could
hear
every
word
that
passed
between
the
two
men
some
excited
words
ensued
bertram
chesleigh
was
cool
and
calm
he
denied
that
john
glenalvan
had
any
right
to
call
him
to
account
for
what
he
carelessly
termed
his
innocent
flirtation
with
little
golden
from
what
i
can
hear
he
said
you
have
treated
the
girl
both
cruelly
and
wrongfully
i
stand
ready
to
answer
to
golden
grandfather
for
any
wrong
he
may
consider
i
have
done
but
i
shall
make
no
apology
to
you
mr
glenalvan
why
not
said
the
man
with
repressed
passion
the
girl
is
my
niece
yet
you
have
wickedly
secluded
her
from
all
society
and
even
debarred
her
of
her
freedom
said
bertram
chesleigh
indignantly
it
is
your
fault
alone
that
she
has
been
driven
to
seek
the
natural
delights
of
youth
in
a
clandestine
manner
it
is
not
my
fault
but
her
mother
said
john
glenalvan
significantly
his
face
grew
pale
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
strayed
furtively
to
the
quiet
lake
lying
silvery
and
serene
in
the
clear
moonlight
how
i
do
not
understand
you
said
the
other
haughtily
john
glenalvan
hesitated
a
moment
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
an
affectation
of
deep
feeling
and
manly
sorrow
chesleigh
he
said
your
unhesitating
charge
against
me
of
cruelty
to
my
niece
forces
me
to
the
disclosure
of
a
most
painful
family
secret
one
that
i
would
fain
have
guarded
from
your
knowledge
there
is
a
strong
reason
for
my
course
toward
golden
glenalvan
he
paused
and
the
listener
said
hoarsely
a
reason
then
paused
because
his
voice
had
broken
utterly
yes
a
reason
was
the
bitter
reply
chesleigh
little
golden
is
the
child
of
my
own
and
only
sister
but
how
shall
i
tell
you
she
has
no
right
and
no
place
in
the
world
she
is
nameless
the
solid
earth
seemed
to
reel
beneath
chesleigh
feet
he
staggered
back
dizzily
and
threw
up
his
hands
as
if
the
man
had
struck
him
he
is
proud
the
blow
tells
fearfully
thought
elinor
watching
him
through
the
trees
with
vindictive
eyes
ah
my
defiant
golden
your
last
chance
is
gone
now
he
will
never
look
at
you
again
glenalvan
you
do
not
mean
it
you
are
but
trying
my
credulity
cried
bertram
chesleigh
is
it
likely
that
i
would
publish
a
falsehood
to
my
own
discredit
inquired
the
other
no
no
but
oh
god
this
is
too
dreadful
to
believe
dreadful
but
true
groaned
john
glenalvan
golden
is
the
child
of
sin
and
shame
if
i
had
had
my
way
she
would
have
been
consigned
to
a
foundling
asylum
but
my
father
weakly
insisted
on
rearing
her
himself
and
i
was
injudicious
enough
to
permit
it
the
only
stipulation
i
made
was
that
she
should
be
kept
away
from
the
sight
of
the
world
as
much
as
possible
i
see
now
that
all
precautions
were
useless
young
as
she
is
the
bad
blood
in
her
veins
begins
to
show
itself
already
in
depraved
conduct
hush
do
not
censure
her
harmless
meetings
with
me
said
bertram
chesleigh
in
a
voice
of
agony
the
child
is
so
pure
and
innocent
she
has
no
idea
of
evil
i
would
die
before
i
would
wrong
her
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
the
other
if
you
really
mean
it
perhaps
you
will
agree
to
relinquish
your
useless
pursuit
of
her
you
would
not
be
willing
to
marry
her
after
what
you
have
heard
i
am
quite
sure
meantime
little
golden
walked
away
with
her
grandfather
who
stumbled
along
like
one
in
a
painful
dream
his
gray
head
bowed
as
if
beneath
the
weight
of
sorrow
his
footsteps
faltering
and
slow
he
had
not
spoken
one
word
and
his
silence
impressed
golden
with
a
sense
of
her
and
disobedience
far
more
than
the
loudest
reproaches
could
have
done
she
clung
to
his
hand
weeping
and
sighing
and
shivering
silently
at
old
dinah
muttered
invectives
against
chesleigh
hugh
glenalvan
spoke
no
words
to
his
granddaughter
until
he
had
led
her
into
the
house
then
he
sank
into
his
chair
and
his
gray
head
drooped
upon
his
breast
surprise
and
sorrow
seemed
to
have
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
speech
golden
knelt
at
his
feet
and
laid
her
golden
head
upon
his
knee
grandpa
speak
to
me
she
wailed
do
not
be
angry
with
your
little
golden
oh
grandpa
you
have
been
so
hard
and
strict
with
me
you
have
kept
me
too
secluded
if
you
had
let
me
have
freedom
and
happiness
like
other
girls
this
never
would
have
happened
hush
little
missie
you
must
not
speak
to
ole
massa
like
dat
cried
dinah
trying
to
pull
her
away
you
do
know
what
you
talkin
come
away
till
ole
massa
is
well
enough
to
talk
to
you
dis
fing
she
lifted
the
girl
and
would
have
led
her
away
but
the
old
man
waved
his
hand
feebly
to
detain
her
and
so
she
placed
her
in
a
chair
instead
then
she
brought
a
glass
of
wine
and
poured
a
little
between
the
white
writhing
lips
of
her
old
master
grandpa
speak
to
me
wailed
golden
again
old
dinah
looked
at
her
almost
sternly
and
said
abruptly
you
must
let
him
alone
miss
golden
you
have
enamost
kilt
him
now
with
your
badness
and
deceit
black
mammy
you
shall
not
speak
to
me
so
cried
the
girl
resentfully
and
then
the
bright
head
drooped
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
she
wept
bitterly
more
from
fright
at
the
condition
of
her
grandfather
than
from
any
tangible
sense
of
her
own
she
loved
her
grandfather
dearly
and
the
sight
of
his
suffering
stabbed
her
tender
heart
deeply
while
she
wept
silently
old
dinah
busied
herself
in
anxious
cares
for
the
old
man
he
seemed
frozen
into
a
statue
of
despair
sitting
with
his
head
bowed
forlornly
and
his
vacant
eyes
on
the
floor
but
quite
suddenly
he
roused
himself
and
looked
around
him
with
a
heavy
hopeless
gaze
dinah
leave
me
alone
he
said
with
unwonted
impatience
i
am
not
ill
or
if
i
am
it
is
with
a
sickness
beyond
mortal
healing
disobedience
and
her
cruel
undeserved
reproaches
have
broken
my
heart
golden
threw
herself
impulsively
at
his
feet
again
grandpa
forgive
me
she
wailed
i
shall
die
if
you
do
not
say
that
you
will
pardon
me
he
did
not
answer
her
he
only
looked
at
his
old
black
servant
dinah
you
may
leave
us
he
said
sorrowfully
i
had
hoped
to
keep
the
secret
all
my
life
but
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
reveal
to
my
grandchild
her
mother
story
e
groaned
the
old
negress
sh
i
it
was
a
brack
day
when
john
glenalvan
kem
here
dat
mornin
ole
massa
to
shut
my
pore
chile
up
like
a
hush
dinah
the
old
man
repeated
pointing
to
the
door
she
went
out
and
golden
turned
her
beautiful
eyes
like
blue
violets
drowned
in
tears
upon
his
pale
drawn
face
oh
grandpa
she
cried
you
will
tell
me
something
of
my
mother
at
last
i
have
so
longed
to
hear
something
of
my
mother
and
my
father
a
groan
forced
itself
through
hugh
glenalvan
livid
lips
your
desire
shall
be
gratified
he
replied
but
the
telling
will
cost
you
great
sorrow
child
her
beautiful
face
grew
white
and
scared
oh
grandpa
she
cried
then
elinor
and
clare
told
the
truth
my
poor
mother
a
bursting
sob
checked
the
rest
of
her
speech
golden
before
i
tell
you
your
mother
story
i
must
receive
your
own
confession
dinah
has
told
me
all
the
beginning
of
your
acquaintance
with
my
son
visitor
you
must
now
give
me
the
history
of
what
further
intercourse
has
passed
between
you
how
comes
it
that
my
little
golden
whom
i
deemed
so
true
and
pure
broke
her
promise
to
old
dinah
the
beautiful
face
drooped
from
his
gaze
overspread
with
warm
crimson
blushes
no
words
came
from
the
sweet
tremulous
red
lips
a
promise
child
no
matter
how
humble
the
person
to
whom
it
is
made
should
be
held
perfectly
sacred
and
inviolate
he
continued
i
could
not
have
believed
that
you
the
child
i
had
reared
so
carefully
could
have
been
so
ignoble
as
to
falsify
your
promise
chapter
xi
beautiful
golden
sobbed
wildly
at
the
reproachful
words
of
her
grandfather
grandpa
i
did
mean
it
she
wept
indeed
indeed
i
intended
to
keep
my
promise
to
black
mammy
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
i
broke
it
how
could
it
have
been
by
accident
inquired
the
old
man
incredulously
do
you
remember
my
habit
of
she
inquired
yes
ah
yes
for
it
has
frightened
me
often
to
see
a
little
white
figure
glide
into
my
room
at
night
with
vacant
unseeing
eyes
i
always
feared
you
would
run
into
some
terrible
danger
your
mother
had
the
same
unfortunate
habit
replied
the
old
man
grandpa
it
was
through
that
habit
of
mine
that
i
broke
my
word
to
black
mammy
said
golden
with
an
earnestness
that
showed
how
truthful
was
her
explanation
tell
me
how
it
occurred
golden
he
said
fixing
his
dim
eyes
anxiously
on
her
face
grandpa
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
she
replied
blushing
crimson
but
it
was
in
this
way
the
night
after
chesleigh
entered
my
room
by
accident
i
was
very
restless
in
my
sleep
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
begun
to
love
the
handsome
stranger
i
thought
of
him
before
i
fell
asleep
and
in
my
restless
slumbers
i
dreamed
of
him
so
i
fell
into
my
old
habit
of
wandering
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
i
dressed
myself
and
wandered
out
into
the
grounds
and
down
by
the
lake
my
favorite
suddenly
i
started
broad
awake
in
the
arms
of
chesleigh
i
had
gone
too
near
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
he
had
saved
me
from
falling
in
she
shuddered
slightly
and
resumed
in
common
gratitude
i
was
compelled
to
speak
and
thank
the
gentleman
for
saving
me
from
a
watery
grave
do
you
think
i
was
wrong
to
do
so
it
would
have
been
cold
and
ungrateful
to
have
omitted
thanking
him
he
admitted
so
i
thought
said
golden
if
your
intercourse
had
stopped
there
golden
i
should
have
had
no
words
of
blame
for
you
but
you
have
carried
on
a
secret
intrigue
ever
since
you
have
stolen
out
to
meet
that
man
every
night
have
you
not
yes
grandpa
but
we
loved
each
other
said
the
simple
child
who
seemed
to
think
that
was
ample
excuse
for
what
she
had
done
hugh
glenalvan
groaned
and
remained
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
he
bent
down
and
whispered
a
question
in
her
ear
she
started
violently
the
warm
color
flashed
into
her
cheek
she
threw
up
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
proud
grieved
eyes
grandpa
you
hurt
me
cruelly
she
replied
do
not
think
of
me
so
unkindly
i
am
as
pure
as
the
snow
he
seemed
to
be
relieved
by
the
words
so
quickly
and
proudly
spoken
the
next
minute
he
said
gravely
my
child
has
this
gentleman
ever
said
anything
to
you
of
marriage
little
golden
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
a
moment
then
she
answered
steadily
yes
he
wishes
to
marry
you
then
yes
answered
the
girl
with
a
little
quiver
of
triumphant
happiness
in
her
voice
when
he
asked
a
shadow
fell
over
the
fair
sweet
face
a
moment
i
do
not
know
exactly
when
she
replied
but
chesleigh
will
see
you
he
told
me
just
now
that
he
would
and
then
he
will
settle
everything
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
the
breeze
sighed
softly
through
the
trees
outside
they
could
hear
it
in
the
utter
stillness
the
dim
flaring
light
fell
on
the
gray
head
of
the
old
man
drooping
forlornly
on
his
breast
and
on
the
lovely
upturned
face
of
the
girl
with
its
tender
blue
eyes
and
falling
golden
hair
grandpa
she
whispered
do
not
be
angry
with
your
little
girl
put
your
hand
on
my
head
and
say
you
forgive
me
for
my
fault
he
could
not
resist
the
coaxing
voice
and
the
asking
blue
eyes
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
golden
head
and
said
solemnly
and
kindly
i
forgive
you
my
little
golden
and
i
pray
heaven
that
no
evil
may
come
of
this
affair
she
kissed
his
wrinkled
tremulous
old
hand
where
it
hung
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
thank
you
she
said
gratefully
i
am
so
glad
you
are
not
angry
with
me
and
now
dear
grandpa
i
am
going
to
kneel
right
here
and
listen
while
you
tell
me
my
mother
story
in
the
momentary
silence
the
wind
outside
seemed
to
sigh
more
sadly
through
the
trees
the
dim
light
flared
and
flickered
casting
weird
fantastic
shadows
in
the
corners
of
the
room
deep
heavy
sighs
quivered
over
the
old
man
lips
as
the
beautiful
girl
knelt
there
with
her
blue
eyes
lifted
so
eagerly
to
his
face
chapter
xii
you
are
the
image
of
your
mother
my
child
said
grandfather
she
had
a
white
skin
pink
cheeks
blue
eyes
and
shining
hair
you
inherit
her
happy
disposition
you
bear
the
same
name
also
golden
glenalvan
why
was
i
never
called
by
my
father
name
asked
innocent
golden
my
child
you
anticipate
my
story
he
answered
but
i
will
tell
you
you
have
no
right
to
your
father
name
a
cry
of
terror
came
from
the
parted
lips
of
the
girl
oh
grandpa
you
do
not
mean
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
you
must
remember
that
it
is
not
my
fault
he
answered
she
sprang
up
and
stood
before
him
with
a
look
of
white
despair
on
her
lovely
young
face
now
i
understand
it
all
she
said
i
know
why
my
life
is
so
unlike
that
of
other
girls
oh
grandpa
grandpa
tell
me
where
to
find
my
mother
that
i
may
curse
her
for
my
ruined
life
his
only
answer
was
a
low
and
groan
grandpa
tell
me
where
to
find
her
repeated
little
golden
wildly
she
must
be
living
for
i
remember
now
that
no
one
has
ever
told
me
plainly
that
she
was
dead
i
will
go
to
her
i
will
reproach
her
for
her
sin
i
will
tell
her
what
a
life
mine
has
been
how
i
have
been
hated
and
despised
for
my
mother
fault
even
by
my
kindred
sighs
long
and
bitter
heaved
the
old
man
breast
but
he
answered
her
not
she
flung
herself
weeping
at
his
feet
you
do
not
speak
she
cried
oh
grandpa
tell
me
where
to
find
my
cruel
mother
she
is
with
your
father
said
hugh
glenalvan
in
a
deep
and
bitter
voice
that
showed
what
agony
he
endured
in
the
revelation
of
his
daughter
disgrace
and
infamy
golden
threw
up
her
little
hands
in
convulsive
agony
oh
not
that
she
cried
tell
me
it
is
not
true
again
he
had
no
answer
for
her
and
golden
cried
out
reproachfully
grandpa
grandpa
why
did
you
suffer
her
to
be
so
wicked
it
was
through
no
fault
of
mine
he
answered
heavily
she
looked
at
him
in
silent
anguish
a
moment
then
she
asked
him
where
is
she
tell
me
where
to
find
her
if
you
know
john
told
me
she
was
in
new
york
the
last
time
he
heard
of
her
but
that
was
years
ago
i
pray
god
that
she
may
be
dead
ere
this
and
then
he
wrung
his
hands
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
withered
cheeks
oh
my
lost
little
daughter
my
precious
little
golden
he
moaned
in
agony
how
little
i
dreamed
in
your
innocent
babyhood
that
you
were
reserved
for
such
a
fate
golden
was
regarding
him
attentively
uncle
john
told
you
she
was
in
new
york
she
said
what
did
uncle
john
know
did
he
hate
my
mother
as
he
hates
me
he
looked
at
her
startled
hate
your
mother
he
cried
his
own
sister
no
of
course
not
that
is
not
until
she
fell
he
hated
her
then
asked
golden
musingly
yes
he
hated
her
then
i
believe
he
could
have
killed
her
he
should
have
killed
her
betrayer
said
golden
who
seemed
suddenly
to
have
acquired
the
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
of
a
woman
i
would
have
killed
him
myself
if
i
could
have
laid
hands
on
the
villain
said
her
grandfather
with
sudden
irrepressible
passion
the
bitter
grief
and
impatient
wrath
of
the
girl
had
sobered
down
into
quietness
more
grievous
than
tears
her
face
showed
deathly
white
in
the
dim
light
her
lips
were
set
in
a
line
of
intense
pain
her
eyes
had
grown
black
with
feeling
she
brought
a
low
stool
and
sat
down
at
her
grandfather
feet
folding
her
white
hands
meekly
in
her
lap
and
drooping
her
fair
head
heavily
grandpa
i
will
not
interrupt
you
again
she
said
i
will
sit
here
quite
still
and
listen
now
tell
me
all
my
mother
story
she
kept
her
word
after
he
had
told
her
all
he
had
to
tell
and
she
knew
the
whole
tragic
story
of
her
mother
disgrace
she
still
sat
there
silently
with
her
dark
eyes
bent
on
her
clasped
hands
the
cloud
of
shame
and
disgrace
seemed
to
lower
upon
her
head
with
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
you
understand
all
i
have
told
my
child
he
said
to
her
after
waiting
vainly
for
her
to
speak
she
put
her
small
hand
to
her
head
in
a
dazed
uncertain
way
oh
yes
i
think
so
she
replied
but
my
head
seems
in
a
whirl
i
will
ask
you
just
a
few
questions
grandpa
to
make
sure
that
i
have
understood
and
then
she
seemed
to
fall
into
a
brown
study
when
she
had
collected
her
thoughts
a
little
she
began
to
question
him
i
think
you
said
that
my
mother
eloped
at
sixteen
with
a
handsome
stranger
whose
acquaintance
she
had
casually
made
in
her
long
lonely
rambles
in
the
woods
in
a
few
weeks
she
wrote
to
you
from
new
york
that
she
was
happily
married
am
i
right
grandpa
yes
he
replied
and
then
although
you
and
uncle
john
wrote
repeatedly
you
could
hear
no
more
from
her
until
a
year
had
passed
and
she
came
back
unexpectedly
one
dreadful
stormy
night
she
paused
and
he
murmured
a
dreary
yes
dear
she
was
in
sore
trouble
the
girl
went
on
slowly
she
had
found
out
that
her
husband
had
deceived
her
she
was
not
legally
his
wife
their
marriage
had
only
been
a
mock
marriage
so
she
left
him
that
is
right
he
said
as
she
paused
again
and
uncle
john
her
only
and
elder
brother
cursed
her
for
the
disgrace
she
had
brought
on
the
glenalvans
i
think
you
told
me
that
did
you
not
dear
grandpa
she
said
lifting
her
heavy
eyes
a
moment
to
his
sad
old
face
yes
dear
he
cursed
her
john
was
always
stern
and
hard
and
he
was
always
jealous
of
our
love
for
his
little
sister
he
thought
we
had
spoiled
her
and
he
was
bitterly
angry
when
she
returned
to
us
in
sorrow
and
shame
he
was
married
to
a
woman
as
hard
as
himself
and
they
were
both
for
driving
her
forth
like
a
dog
but
dinah
and
i
for
my
daughter
mother
had
died
while
she
was
away
were
too
for
that
we
cared
for
the
poor
desolate
child
in
spite
of
john
threats
and
curses
and
that
very
night
i
was
born
said
little
golden
with
the
heaviest
sigh
in
which
any
mortal
ever
cursed
the
hour
of
birth
yes
you
were
born
in
the
storm
and
terror
of
that
dreadful
night
he
answered
with
a
heavy
sigh
and
your
mother
almost
broke
her
heart
over
you
because
you
would
never
bear
the
name
of
the
man
she
had
loved
so
well
and
that
name
dear
grandpa
tell
me
what
it
was
she
cried
with
repressed
eagerness
my
dear
she
would
never
reveal
that
name
she
loved
him
although
he
had
betrayed
her
she
was
afraid
of
our
vengeance
a
look
of
keen
disappointment
came
over
the
beautiful
mobile
face
but
grandpa
she
said
when
she
wrote
you
from
new
york
after
she
left
you
in
the
first
flush
of
her
happiness
when
she
had
not
your
vengeance
to
fear
did
she
not
reveal
her
name
then
not
even
then
said
the
old
man
bitterly
she
hinted
that
there
was
some
innocent
but
just
cause
for
secrecy
just
then
but
that
she
would
send
her
true
name
and
address
in
the
next
letter
that
next
letter
never
came
there
is
not
the
slightest
clew
for
me
then
i
shall
never
find
my
mother
said
the
girl
sorrowfully
golden
why
should
you
wish
to
find
her
she
is
a
sinner
leading
a
life
of
shame
she
deserted
you
in
your
helpless
infancy
to
return
to
the
arms
of
the
villain
who
had
betrayed
her
so
uncle
john
says
returned
the
girl
meaningly
he
started
more
at
the
tone
than
the
words
golden
do
you
doubt
him
he
cried
yes
said
the
girl
steadily
turning
on
him
the
full
splendor
of
her
eyes
in
which
glowed
a
spark
of
indignant
fire
yes
grandpa
i
doubt
it
i
utterly
refuse
to
believe
such
a
scandalous
story
of
my
mother
he
looked
at
her
sadly
touched
by
her
loyal
faith
in
the
mother
she
had
never
known
but
think
my
dear
he
said
you
were
but
a
few
days
old
when
she
stole
away
in
the
night
and
left
you
without
a
line
to
tell
us
of
her
whereabouts
but
john
blood
was
up
he
traced
her
to
new
york
and
learned
enough
to
be
sure
that
she
had
returned
to
her
lover
then
he
lost
all
trace
of
them
and
came
home
reluctantly
enough
for
he
would
have
shot
the
villain
if
he
could
have
laid
hands
on
him
it
is
a
plausible
story
the
girl
said
thoughtfully
i
might
believe
it
if
any
one
but
john
glenalvan
had
told
it
but
oh
grandpa
that
man
always
reminds
me
of
a
snake
in
the
grass
my
child
that
is
one
of
old
dinah
homely
phrases
he
remonstrated
it
is
a
very
true
one
though
she
maintained
stoutly
he
saw
that
he
could
not
convince
her
so
he
sighed
and
remained
silent
he
had
never
thought
of
doubting
his
son
assertion
himself
incredulity
awakened
a
vague
sense
of
uneasiness
in
his
mind
the
girl
sat
silently
also
for
a
brief
space
of
time
while
the
old
clock
in
the
corner
slowly
ticked
away
the
moments
of
that
momentous
night
she
roused
herself
from
her
drooping
dejected
attitude
at
last
and
looked
up
at
the
quiet
old
man
grandpa
she
said
anxiously
as
if
some
sudden
doubt
or
fear
had
come
into
her
mind
what
will
bert
say
when
he
hears
this
dreadful
story
bert
said
her
grandfather
questioningly
chesleigh
i
mean
she
replied
what
will
he
say
when
my
story
is
known
to
him
will
he
too
hate
me
for
my
mother
sin
a
look
of
pain
and
dread
came
over
the
sad
old
face
my
darling
how
can
i
tell
he
said
i
have
heard
that
the
chesleighs
are
very
proud
it
is
only
too
likely
that
he
will
scorn
you
when
he
knows
the
truth
i
am
afraid
you
must
give
up
all
thought
of
loving
him
dear
a
strange
intense
look
came
over
the
beautiful
young
face
i
can
not
do
that
she
said
i
love
him
with
my
whole
heart
i
shall
love
him
all
my
life
he
loves
me
too
grandpa
he
can
not
give
me
up
he
will
be
true
to
me
i
am
not
to
blame
for
my
mother
fault
no
dear
i
know
that
he
answered
but
the
sins
of
the
parents
are
visited
on
the
children
it
is
not
likely
that
chesleigh
will
care
to
wed
a
nameless
girl
he
is
wealthy
and
and
can
have
his
choice
from
among
the
best
in
the
land
your
cousin
elinor
aspires
to
marry
him
he
will
never
marry
elinor
said
little
golden
decidedly
he
loves
me
alone
he
will
be
true
to
me
god
grant
it
dear
her
grandfather
said
with
a
patient
sigh
in
which
there
was
but
little
hope
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
first
pale
gleams
of
the
summer
dawn
stealing
into
the
room
through
the
open
window
the
birds
began
to
warble
their
mating
songs
in
the
magnolia
trees
outside
as
if
there
were
no
care
nor
sorrow
nor
blighting
disgrace
anywhere
in
the
wide
beautiful
world
my
little
one
he
said
to
the
grave
child
who
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
a
woman
go
to
your
room
and
rest
you
look
terribly
ill
and
wretched
do
not
go
back
to
the
haunted
chamber
again
but
to
your
old
room
down
stairs
try
to
sleep
if
you
can
he
looked
after
her
in
wonder
as
she
turned
to
obey
him
yesterday
she
had
been
a
beautiful
charming
careless
child
full
of
pretty
evanescent
angers
and
quick
repentances
the
bloom
the
smiles
the
brightness
were
all
gone
now
the
lashes
drooped
heavily
against
the
cheeks
the
sweet
lips
quivered
the
slow
and
lagging
step
was
that
of
a
weary
woman
chapter
xiii
as
soon
as
she
had
reached
the
seclusion
of
her
own
chamber
little
golden
threw
herself
across
her
bed
and
wept
as
though
her
tender
heart
would
break
strangely
nurtured
as
she
had
been
the
pride
of
race
had
been
as
strong
in
her
young
heart
as
that
of
any
glenalvan
of
them
all
and
the
shock
of
her
grandfather
revelation
had
been
a
terrible
one
i
wish
that
i
had
died
in
my
innocent
babyhood
she
wept
and
her
black
mammy
who
had
been
lingering
near
her
unobserved
came
forward
to
her
and
said
quickly
while
she
smoothed
the
golden
hair
lovingly
with
her
old
black
hands
you
must
not
say
dat
honey
chile
i
has
great
hopes
in
your
life
i
has
almos
wore

brack
knees
an
to
de
good
lawd
dat
you
might
be
de
instrument
to
sabe
your
mudder
from
her
sinful
life
little
golden
looked
at
her
black
mammy
with
a
kind
of
pathetic
wonder
in
her
beautiful
tearful
eyes
how
could
i
do
that
black
mammy
she
said
by
seekin
dat
poor
soul
out
miss
golden
and
her
to
forsake
dat
wicked
man
an
spend
de
balance
ob
her
life
in
prayin
repentin
ob
her
deadly
sins
said
dinah
devoutly
and
earnestly
golden
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
looked
at
dinah
with
eager
shining
eyes
and
impulsively
clasped
hands
ah
black
mammy
if
i
only
could
she
cried
but
you
forget
i
do
not
know
where
to
find
her
i
do
not
even
know
the
name
of
that
dreadful
man
and
she
shivered
at
the
thought
of
his
wickedness
she
remembered
that
he
was
her
father
that
his
bad
blood
flowed
in
her
veins
old
dinah
was
looking
at
her
strangely
little
missie
what
would
you
think
if
i
could
tell
you
his
name
she
said
with
a
little
note
of
triumph
in
her
tone
could
you
oh
could
you
cried
little
golden
impulsively
jest
wait
one
minute
darlin
said
dinah
hobbling
out
of
the
room
golden
waited
wonderingly
and
impatiently
after
a
little
while
dinah
returned
and
laid
a
small
package
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
in
her
hand
golden
removed
the
wrappers
tremblingly
a
small
bit
of
crumpled
pasteboard
fell
out
into
her
hand
she
straightened
it
out
and
devoured
with
eager
eyes
the
aristocratic
name
printed
upon
it
in
small
clear
black
type
then
she
raised
her
gleaming
eyes
to
the
excited
face
of
the
old
black
woman
so
she
said
with
a
long
deep
sobbing
breath
this
is
my
name
yes
chile
leastways
i
has
de
berry
best
reason
for
finking
so
replied
dinah
promptly
then
you
are
not
sure
cried
the
girl
and
there
was
a
note
of
keen
disappointment
in
her
voice
all
i
know
is
dis
honey
it
fell
outer
your
mudder
pocket
de
night
when
you
was
born
she
was
drawin

sabed

for

honey
chile
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
black
mammy
said
the
girl
you
had
very
good
reason
for
thinking
it
was
my
father
name
but
it
is
a
wonder
you
never
gave
it
to
grandpa
or
to
uncle
john
who
gib
john
glenalvan
anything
or
tell
him
anything
not
to

dinah
flying
into
a
rage
as
she
always
did
at
the
mention
of
golden
uncle
black
mammy
why
do
you
hate
my
uncle
so
bitterly
asked
golden
he
a
snake
in
de
grass
replied
dinah
shortly
i

i
have
always
felt
it
said
golden
meditatively
but

be
some
particular
reason

abruptly

silence
her
blue
eyes
were
on
fire
with
indignation
and
grief
at
times
she
would
murmur
poor
dear
grandpa
dear
grandpa
and
relapse
into
silence
again
she
roused
herself
at
last
from
her
musing
mood
and
looked
up
at
dinah
there
was
a
hopeful
light
in
the
soft
blue
eyes
so
lately
drowned
in
tears
of
sorrow
and
despair

darlin
you
had
forgotten
her
said
dinah
a
little
wistfully
her
thoughts
straying
back
through
the
mist
of
years
to
the
lost
little
nursling
who
had
fluttered
from
the
safe
parental
nest
and
steeped
the
white
wings
of
her
soul
in
the
blackness
of
sin
but
golden
shook
her
dainty
head
decidedly
no
black
mammy
i
had
not
forgotten
she
said
when
i
am

shall
help
me
to
seek
and
save
my
poor
lost
mother
we
will
try
to
win
her
back
to
the
path
of
right
and
save
her
soul
for
heaven
she
concluded
with
girlish
ardor
and
fervency
may
the
good
lawd
help
you
to
succeed
my
innercent
lamb
said
the
good
old
black
woman
prayerfully
her
little
soul
was
too
white
and
tender
for
de
brack
debbil
to
git
it
at
de
last
for
his
brack
dominions
there
was
a
sudden
tap
at
the
door
golden
looked
at
it
eagerly
and
expectantly
while
dinah
threw
it
open
a
small
black
boy
a
servant
of
john
glenalvan
stood
outside
with
a
sealed
letter
in
his
hand
for
missie
golden
from
mass
chesleigh
he
said
putting
it
in
dinah
hand
and
quickly
retiring
dinah
carried
it
silently
to
her
mistress
who
kissed
the
superscription
and
eagerly
tore
it
open
the
thick
sheet
rustled
in
the
trembling
little
hand
as
the
blue
eyes
ran
over
it
lovingly
and
eagerly
as
she
read
the
tender
loving
eyes
grew
wild
and
startled
an
ashen
shade
crept
around
the
rosebud
lips
the
young
face
whitened
to
the
hue
of
death
she
crumpled
the
sheet
in
her
hand
at
last
and
threw
it
wildly
from
her
while
a
cry
of
intolerable
anguish
thrilled
over
her
white
lips
oh
mammy
mammy
my
heart
is
broken
broken
i
shall
never
see
him
again
he
has
forsaken
me
for
my
mother
sin
then
she
fell
back
cold
and
rigid
like
one
dead
upon
the
bed
dinah
flew
to
her
assistance
cursing
in
her
heart
the
wickedness
and
heartlessness
of
men
but
though
she
worked
busily
and
anxiously
the
morning
sun
rode
high
in
the
heavens
before
the
girl
recovered
her
consciousness
her
grandfather
was
watching
beside
her
pillow
when
her
eyes
first
opened
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
wept
long
and
bitterly
on
his
faithful
breast
you
were
right
she
whispered
to
him
you
know
the
cruel
world
better
than
i
did
he
has
left
me
grandpa
i
shall
never
see
him
again
he
discards
me
for
my
mother
sin
she
wept
and
moaned
all
day
refusing
all
consolation
she
was
terrified
by
the
coldness
and
cruelty
of
the
world
that
condemned
her
for
the
sins
of
others
many
and
many
a
time
she
had
chafed
at
the
narrowness
and
loneliness
of
her
lot
but
she
had
never
known
sorrow
until
its
horrible
reality
crushed
her
down
before
its
pitiless
strength
like
the
fury
of
the
a
crushed
and
bleeding
victim
she
lay
weak
and
stunned
in
its
victorious
path
at
nightfall
she
slept
wearied
out
by
the
force
and
violence
of
her
deep
overmastering
emotion
old
dinah
persuaded
her
weary
haggard
old
master
to
retire
to
his
room
and
bed
promising
to
watch
faithfully
herself
by
the
sick
girl
she
dozed
until
midnight
when
as
golden
still
slept
on
heavily
she
permitted
herself
to
take
a
wary
nap
in
an
old
it
was
daylight
when
the
weary
suffering
old
creature
awoke
the
beautiful
golden
was
gone
a
little
note
lay
on
the
pillow
that
still
held
the
impress
of
the
dear
little
head
the
child
had
written
sorrowfully
to
her
grandfather

have
only
brought

be

to
you
when

kind
and
faithful
to

so
you
will
not
miss
your
thoughtless
little

much
god

chapter
xiv
from
the
fair
southern
clime
where
her
lines
had
hitherto
been
cast
little
golden
traveled
straight
to
the
great
thronged
city
of
new
york
during
her
long
day
and
night
of
intense
suffering
the
thought
first
suggested
to
her
mind
by
old
dinah
of
seeking
and
reclaiming
her
erring
mother
had
fastened
on
her
mind
with
irresistible
force
and
power
every
thought
and
feeling
of
this
beautiful
unhappy
child
was
as
pure
as
that
of
an
angel
the
knowledge
that
the
young
mother
who
had
given
her
birth
was
living
a
life
of
sin
and
dishonor
was
most
revolting
to
her
mind
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
a
mortal
shudder
when
dinah
fell
asleep
by
her
pillow
the
girl
awakened
suddenly
and
lay
for
a
little
while
in
silent
meditation
the
idea
she
had
been
silently
revolving
in
her
mind
all
day
gathered
strength
in
the
solitude
and
stillness
of
the
midnight
hour
golden
was
young
buoyant
ignorant
of
the
world
and
thought
not
of
the
difficulties
that
would
hedge
the
path
of
duty
which
she
was
marking
out
for
her
little
untried
feet
she
did
not
know
how
dear
she
was
to
her
grandfather
heart
and
how
bitterly
he
would
be
wounded
by
her
desertion
she
only
thought
of
escaping
from
the
life
which
had
suddenly
become
so
unbearable
and
of
filling
her
heart
with
other
aims
now
that
the
love
she
had
given
so
lavishly
from
the
depths
of
a
warm
and
generous
heart
had
been
cast
back
to
her
in
scorn
and
contempt
in
the
pocket
of
her
best
cashmere
dress
was
a
little
purse
filled
with
gold
pieces
of
which
no
one
knew
but
herself
bertram
chesleigh
had
given
it
to
her
in
a
happy
hour
which
now
it
almost
killed
her
even
to
recall
almost
staggering
with
weakness
golden
rose
and
silently
and
cautiously
dressed
herself
in
her
blue
cashmere
dress
and
hat
and
jacket
she
decided
not
to
take
anything
with
her
it
would
be
easier
to
purchase
new
things
when
she
had
arrived
in
new
york
when
she
was
ready
to
go
golden
knelt
down
a
moment
and
pressed
her
fair
cheek
lovingly
and
sorrowfully
to
the
wrinkled
hand
of
her
old
black
mammy
she
loved
the
old
negress
dearly
under
that
homely
black
breast
beat
the
only
heart
that
had
ever
given
a
mother
love
to
the
beautiful
forsaken
child
of
poor
wronged
and
misguided
little
golden
then
with
a
lingering
loving
backward
glance
around
the
girl
left
the
room
and
proceeded
to
her
grandfather
apartment
the
kind
old
man
was
asleep
with
a
look
of
care
and
anxiety
deeply
imprinted
on
his
pale
worn
features
golden
pressed
her
trembling
lips
to
the
thin
gray
locks
that
straggled
over
the
pillow
and
her
girlish
tears
fell
on
them
shining
like
jewels
in
the
dim
gleam
of
the
then
golden
stole
away
noiselessly
there
was
one
more
farewell
to
be
said
ere
she
set
forth
on
the
mission
whose
only
clew
lay
in
the
crumpled
card
hidden
away
securely
in
the
little
purse
of
gold
she
knelt
down
on
the
banks
of
the
tranquil
little
lake
she
had
always
loved
so
dearly
and
clasped
her
little
hands
and
lifted
her
white
face
in
the
bright
moonlight
farewell
little
lake
she
murmured
to
the
silvery
tranquil
sheet
of
water
i
pray
god
that
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
kneel
by
you
again
and
tell
you
that
i
have
reclaimed
my
erring
mother
and
that
her
soul
has
been
washed
as
pure
and
free
from
sin
as
the
lilies
sleeping
on
your
breast
was
it
only
little
golden
excited
fancy
or
did
a
shadow
soft
and
impalpable
as
a
mist
wreath
and
pale
as
the
moonbeams
glide
across
the
still
water
in
the
form
of
a
woman
and
a
voice
as
soft
and
low
as
the
sigh
of
the
breeze
murmur
sadly
bless
you
my
daughter
she
started
and
looked
around
the
voice
and
vision
had
been
so
real
she
could
hardly
imagine
it
fancy
but
the
phantom
shape
had
dissolved
into
moonbeams
again
and
the
voice
had
melted
into
music
on
the
homeless
winds
if
my
poor
mother
was
dead
i
should
believe
that
her
spirit
had
blessed
me
said
the
beautiful
girl
to
herself
but
she
is
alive
so
it
could
not
have
been
she
perhaps
it
was
my
guardian
angel
she
plucked
a
beautiful
large
white
lily
from
the
lake
and
started
on
her
way
to
the
railway
station
carrying
the
spotless
flower
in
her
hand
perhaps
some
thought
of
the
poet
longfellow
verses
came
to
her
mind
bear
a
lily
in
thine
hand
gates
of
brass
can
not
withstand
one
touch
of
that
magic
wand
bear
through
sorrow
wrong
and
ruth
on
thy
lips
the
smile
of
truth
in
thy
heart
the
dew
of

we
will
return
to
bertram
chesleigh
little
golden
recreant
lover
all
of
john
glenalvan
influence
had
been
brought
to
bear
on
the
proud
young
man
to
induce
him
to
relinquish
his
pursuit
of
the
beautiful
girl
whose
acquaintance
he
had
so
strangely
and
imprudently
formed
chesleigh
own
pride
of
birth
united
to
john
glenalvan
artful
innuendoes
was
a
powerful
ally
in
the
young
man
mind
against
his
love
for
the
lonely
and
beautiful
little
girl
in
the
light
of
john
glenalvan
revelations
a
great
revulsion
had
taken
place
in
his
mind
he
heartily
wished
that
he
had
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
lovely
little
creature
or
that
he
had
not
followed
it
up
with
such
ardor
and
passion
with
few
if
any
exceptions
men
are
naturally
selfish
bertram
chesleigh
who
had
never
known
a
desire
unfulfilled
in
the
course
of
his
prosperous
life
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
pursuing
his
acquaintance
with
little
golden
he
had
been
actuated
more
by
a
regard
for
his
own
pleasure
than
by
any
thought
of
risk
for
her
in
the
light
of
recent
developments
he
thought
also
first
of
himself
how
to
escape
from
the
consequences
of
his
headlong
passion
became
momentarily
a
paramount
consideration
when
his
conscience
reproached
him
he
replied
to
it
that
it
was
only
natural
and
right
that
he
should
think
first
of
himself
he
had
his
high
social
station
to
maintain
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
his
friends
and
relations
would
have
declined
to
receive
even
as
his
bride
a
woman
of
stained
birth
golden
had
it
seemed
no
place
in
the
world
no
social
status
whatever
if
he
made
her
his
bride
his
troubles
and
embarrassments
would
be
legion
if
he
left
her
all
would
go
well
with
him
and
he
argued
with
himself
that
the
child
would
speedily
forget
him
and
resign
herself
to
her
strange
and
lonely
life
so
under
the
influence
of
these
vexing
thoughts
and
john
specious
arguments
and
representations
that
unjust
letter
was
written
to
poor
suffering
little
golden
ah
we
are
so
careless
and
so
thoughtless
over
what
we
write
bertram
chesleigh
was
not
a
bad
man
and
never
meant
to
be
cruel
and
yet
he
had
done
more
harm
in
the
writing
of
that
letter
than
if
he
had
pierced
the
tender
heart
with
a
dagger
even
while
writing
it
he
felt
ashamed
and
sorry
yet
no
premonition
came
to
tell
him
of
the
dim
future
when
he
would
have
given
tears
of
blood
to
have
obliterated
even
the
memory
of
that
letter
from
the
heart
of
little
golden
which
it
had
seared
as
with
the
breath
of
fire
he
never
forgot
a
single
word
of
that
letter
he
had
written
to
her
although
in
his
haste
and
agitation
he
had
kept
no
copy
of
it
it
did
not
seem
so
hard
to
him
at
first
as
it
did
afterward
when
he
knew
what
suffering
the
writing
had
caused
and
the
consequences
were
forever
beyond
recall
after
he
had
written
and
dispatched
it
he
made
his
adieu
to
the
family
of
john
glenalvan
and
departed
feeling
like
a
coward
while
if
he
had
truly
understood
the
depth
of
tenderness
and
capabilities
of
woe
in
the
girl
he
had
deserted
he
might
have
felt
more
like
a
murderer
the
glenalvans
while
terribly
disappointed
in
their
hopes
for
elinor
were
relieved
at
the
departure
of
their
guest
for
the
present
elinor
entreated
her
father
to
make
arrangements
for
removing
golden
out
of
the
way
in
case
the
young
man
should
repeat
his
visit
and
he
promised
with
an
oath
more
forcible
than
polite
that
he
would
certainly
do
so
but
before
he
had
taken
any
decisive
step
in
the
furtherance
of
his
purpose
the
unfortunate
girl
had
taken
her
fate
in
her
own
hands
when
john
glenalvan
entered
the
ruined
wing
the
second
day
for
the
purpose
as
he
had
emphatically
expressed
it
of
having
it
out
with
his
father
in
cursed
few
words
he
found
the
old
man
and
his
faithful
old
servant
in
a
frenzy
of
grief
and
despair
over
golden
farewell
letter
john
was
unfeignedly
glad
that
golden
had
gone
away
herself
without
giving
him
the
trouble
and
annoyance
of
sending
her
it
is
much
better
as
it
is
father
he
said
to
the
poor
old
creature
i
fully
intended
to
send
the
girl
away
she
has
only
saved
herself
the
ignominy
of
a
summary
dismissal
do
not
fret
yourself
over
her
she
has
only
forsaken
you
to
lead
a
life
of
shame
with
her
erring
mother
i
hope
that
a
lightning
flash
may
strike
her
dead
before
she
ever
returns
here
again
to
disgrace
and
shame
us
yet
further
forbear
john
you
are
cruel
and
impious
cried
the
old
man
lifting
his
hand
feebly
and
his
son
strode
angrily
out
of
the
room
muttering
curses
not
loud
but
deep
and
followed
by
the
vivid
lightnings
of
old
dinah
black
eyes
oh
de
wilyun
she
muttered
may
de
good
lard
hasten
de
time
ob
punishment
for
his
cruel
sins
chapter
xvi
the
first
thing
that
happened
to
little
golden
glenalvan
after
she
arrived
in
the
city
of
new
york
was
something
that
not
infrequently
happens
to
simple
and
inexperienced
travelers
she
had
her
pocket
picked
of
her
purse
by
some
expert
thief
such
things
have
often
happened
in
the
annals
of
new
york
crime
and
will
again
but
it
is
probable
that
no
one
life
was
ever
so
much
affected
by
such
a
loss
as
was
the
unfortunate
little
golden
she
found
herself
by
this
totally
catastrophe
thrown
into
the
streets
of
the
great
wicked
city
penniless
friendless
and
utterly
forsaken
every
cent
she
possessed
in
the
world
had
been
in
the
little
purse
together
with
the
card
that
bore
her
father
name
the
latter
was
not
so
great
a
loss
to
her
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
mother
was
engraven
on
her
mind
in
characters
that
were
never
to
be
destroyed
her
little
plans
for
the
discovery
of
her
mother
laid
with
such
girlish
art
were
all
turned
away
by
this
accident
she
had
meant
to
take
cheap
lodgings
somewhere
and
prosecute
her
search
but
now
she
knew
not
what
to
do
nor
where
to
turn
the
great
busy
city
with
its
strange
faces
and
hurry
and
bustle
frightened
her
even
though
she
dreamed
not
in
her
girlish
innocence
of
its
festering
sin
and
underlying
wickedness
sinking
down
on
a
secluded
seat
in
central
park
where
she
had
been
walking
when
she
first
discovered
her
loss
she
sobbed
bitterly
in
her
grief
and
distress
so
bitterly
that
a
lady
who
was
walking
along
a
path
with
a
pretty
poodle
frisking
before
her
went
up
to
her
with
kind
abruptness
my
dear
little
girl
she
said
laying
her
hand
gently
on
the
showering
golden
wealth
of
hair
that
escaped
from
golden
little
sailor
hat
what
is
the
matter
can
i
help
you
golden
lifted
her
head
and
the
lady
who
had
a
kind
face
decidedly
aristocratic
started
and
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
at
the
beautiful
girlish
face
with
its
tearful
eyes
like
pansies
drowned
in
dew
in
a
moment
the
lady
quick
eyes
had
seen
from
the
cut
and
fashion
of
golden
simple
garments
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
new
york
she
repeated
kindly
what
ails
you
my
child
have
you
become
separated
from
your
friends
no
for
i
have
not
a
friend
in
this
whole
great
city
but
i
have
lost
my
purse
answered
golden
with
childish
directness
the
lady
sat
down
beside
her
and
regarded
her
a
moment
in
thoughtful
silence
she
saw
nothing
but
the
most
infantile
sweetness
purity
and
truth
in
the
lovely
troubled
young
face
she
was
touched
and
interested
so
you
have
lost
your
purse
she
said
have
you
had
your
pocket
picked
i
do
not
know
answered
golden
forlornly
i
carried
it
in
my
jacket
pocket
and
awhile
ago
when
i
felt
for
it
i
discovered
that
it
was
gone
now
i
am
quite
sure
you
are
a
stranger
in
new
york
said
the
lady
if
you
belonged
in
the
city
you
would
know
better
than
to
carry
your
purse
carelessly
in
the
pocket
of
your
walking
jacket
new
york
is
full
of
sneak
thieves
who
are
on
the
watch
for
the
unwary
you
say
you
have
not
a
friend
in
the
city
where
are
you
from
my
child
from
the
south
replied
golden
did
you
come
to
new
york
alone
yes
madam
i
am
an
orphan
replied
the
girl
not
wishing
to
disclose
her
history
to
her
interrogator
what
do
you
wish
for
in
this
great
city
asked
the
lady
i
want
to
find
some
employment
at
present
can
you
help
me
asked
golden
timidly
and
beseechingly
lifting
her
large
blue
eyes
to
the
interested
face
of
the
lady
perhaps
i
can
said
the
lady
smiling
gently
what
kind
of
employment
do
you
wish
what
kind
of
work
can
you
do
the
beautiful
girlish
face
grew
a
little
blank
she
remembered
her
careless
idle
life
at
glenalvan
hall
where
no
one
ever
taught
her
anything
but
her
grandfather
and
old
dinah
she
was
compelled
to
confess
despondently
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
the
lady
who
was
a
really
good
woman
with
a
decidedly
benevolent
turn
studied
the
drooping
face
attentively
she
saw
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
the
girl
but
the
lovely
young
face
was
so
guileless
and
winning
that
she
could
see
no
evil
in
it
she
asked
her
rather
abruptly
what
her
name
was
golden
glenalvan
answered
the
girl
and
the
lady
frowned
slightly
and
said
it
was
too
fanciful
and
pretty
if
you
are
going
to
work
for
your
living
i
would
advise
you
to
call
yourself
by
some
plain
and
common
name
such
as
jones
or
brown
or
smith
then
i
will
call
myself
mary
smith
replied
golden
resignedly
that
will
do
very
well
now
my
child
do
you
think
you
would
like
to
undertake
chambermaid
work
she
glanced
as
she
spoke
at
the
girl
ungloved
hands
and
saw
that
they
were
delicately
white
and
aristocratic
so
she
answered
the
question
negatively
to
herself
before
golden
answered
shrinkingly
and
timidly
i
do
not
believe
i
would
like
it
madam
but
i
am
willing
to
try
i
must
do
something
to
support
myself
and
i
have
no
choice
left
me
since
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
anything
the
lady
looked
at
her
a
little
wonderingly
my
child
if
you
would
tell
me
something
about
yourself
i
might
know
better
how
to
help
you
she
said
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
have
met
with
reverses
you
are
unaccustomed
to
labor
and
you
look
like
a
born
lady
golden
was
silent
and
a
deep
blush
colored
her
face
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
told
her
sad
story
to
this
gentle
woman
she
fancied
that
the
sweet
pity
beaming
from
her
gray
eyes
now
would
change
to
scorn
and
contempt
if
she
could
know
that
she
was
a
nameless
child
seeking
a
lost
and
guilty
mother
perhaps
you
have
imprudently
run
away
from
your
friends
she
said
questioningly
and
striking
so
near
the
truth
that
golden
burst
into
tears
again
and
would
have
left
her
but
that
she
detained
her
by
a
firm
yet
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
do
not
go
she
said
i
want
to
help
you
if
i
can
perhaps
i
could
tell
you
something
you
are
far
too
young
and
innocent
to
know
what
is
that
asked
golden
looking
at
her
questioningly
this
my
child
that
one
so
pretty
and
simple
as
you
are
should
not
be
alone
and
friendless
in
this
great
city
you
are
in
the
greatest
danger
beauty
is
only
a
curse
to
a
poor
girl
who
has
to
earn
her
own
living
yes
madam
golden
answered
with
perfect
meekness
though
she
crimsoned
painfully
so
i
think
continued
her
kind
friend
that
a
home
and
shelter
in
even
the
humblest
capacity
is
better
for
you
than
to
be
wandering
alone
in
the
streets
homeless
and
penniless
i
know
that
said
golden
but
i
have
nowhere
to
go
and
the
pathos
of
the
tearful
tone
touched
the
kind
lady
heart
my
child
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
she
said
i
have
a
friend
who
needs
a
nurse
for
her
little
invalid
girl
should
you
like
to
try
for
the
situation
oh
yes
golden
answered
gratefully
the
little
girl
is
the
petted
and
only
daughter
of
wealthy
people
continued
the
kind
lady
she
is
delicate
and
has
been
humored
and
spoiled
injudiciously
all
her
life
until
she
is
at
times
quite
overbearing
and
disagreeable
so
much
so
indeed
that
her
mother
can
scarcely
keep
a
nurse
for
her
more
than
a
week
or
two
at
a
time
are
you
frightened
at
my
description
have
you
a
good
store
of
patience
i
have
been
impatient
and
all
my
life
confessed
golden
frankly
yet
you
have
a
face
if
there
is
any
truth
in
physiognomy
said
her
new
friend
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
not
grow
impatient
ministering
to
the
needs
of
that
poor
little
invalid
child
think
how
much
happiness
you
could
give
the
poor
ailing
little
soul
if
you
tried
and
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
she
added
with
a
faint
sigh
you
will
understand
that
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
is
in
giving
happiness
to
others
i
will
try
to
be
patient
and
kind
to
the
child
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
get
the
place
for
me
said
little
golden
trembling
with
eagerness
very
well
my
dear
i
will
myself
accompany
you
to
my
friend
house
and
speak
a
kind
word
in
your
favor
it
is
rather
a
risk
to
run
this
introducing
and
vouching
for
a
total
stranger
but
i
believe
that
your
gentle
honest
face
will
be
a
passport
to
desmond
favor
just
as
it
has
been
to
mine
you
will
follow
me
now
my
child
golden
walked
on
with
the
woman
some
distance
through
the
beautiful
green
park
when
to
her
surprise
her
benefactress
stopped
before
an
elegant
liveried
carriage
with
quite
an
driver
in
a
white
hat
and
gloves
drive
to
desmond
john
she
said
as
the
footman
handed
her
and
her
timid
into
the
carriage
little
golden
felt
like
one
in
a
bewildering
dream
as
she
lay
back
among
the
luxurious
satin
cushions
and
was
whirled
through
the
stately
streets
past
the
beautiful
buildings
and
palaces
until
they
stopped
at
last
before
one
more
splendid
than
all
the
rest
and
she
found
herself
gliding
up
the
marble
steps
her
young
heart
throbbing
fast
at
the
novelty
and
strangeness
of
her
position
she
was
going
to
be
a
servant
in
this
splendid
house
she
one
of
the
glenalvans
of
glenalvan
hall
a
name
that
had
been
proud
and
honored
in
the
past
until
her
girlish
mother
had
stained
its
haughty
prestige
with
shame
her
heart
beat
heavily
and
slow
the
thought
came
to
her
mind
that
these
proud
and
wealthy
people
would
not
even
permit
her
to
be
a
servant
to
their
daughter
if
they
knew
that
she
was
a
nameless
child
chapter
xvii
markham
little
golden
kind
new
friend
was
evidently
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
desmond
instead
of
sending
her
card
to
the
lady
and
awaiting
her
appearance
in
the
formal
she
was
at
once
conducted
up
stairs
to
a
charming
hung
with
silk
and
white
lace
the
carpet
was
white
velvet
strewn
with
a
pattern
of
pink
moss
rosebuds
and
the
chairs
and
couches
were
upholstered
in
a
deeper
shade
of
everything
in
the
room
was
costly
and
tasteful
and
vases
of
flowers
diffused
delicious
fragrance
through
the
air
little
golden
had
never
before
been
in
such
a
costly
and
tasteful
room
and
she
uttered
an
involuntary
low
exclamation
of
surprise
and
delight
at
which
markham
smiled
indulgently
does
this
pretty
room
surprise
you
she
inquired
yes
madam
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
and
costly
before
answered
the
simple
child
at
that
moment
the
heavy
draperies
that
hung
between
the
and
the
were
swept
aside
by
a
white
jeweled
hand
and
the
mistress
of
all
this
magnificence
entered
the
room
she
was
a
beautiful
young
lady
with
great
velvety
black
eyes
dark
waving
hair
crimson
lips
and
rounded
cheeks
like
the
sunny
side
of
a
peach
her
was
elegant
costly
and
becoming
ah
markham
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
she
cried
then
she
looked
past
her
friend
inquiringly
at
the
little
shrinking
figure
of
golden
edith
this
is
a
little
of
mine
mary
smith
by
name
markham
hastened
to
say
if
you
have
not
secured
a
nurse
yet
will
you
try
her
for
little
ruby
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
if
you
think
she
will
suit
returned
desmond
as
they
all
seated
themselves
then
the
handsome
brunette
looked
patronizingly
at
the
new
applicant
for
her
favor
the
scrutiny
did
not
seem
to
please
her
the
slender
arched
black
brows
met
over
the
bright
eyes
in
a
slight
frown
child
why
do
you
not
put
your
hair
up
she
asked
glancing
at
the
bright
wealth
of
loosely
flowing
ringlets
it
is
not
becoming
to
nurses
to
wear
it
in
that
way
i
can
put
it
up
if
you
wish
me
golden
replied
in
a
low
voice
her
eyelids
drooping
that
the
lady
might
not
see
the
childish
resentment
that
flashed
into
them
at
her
slightly
scornful
tone
very
well
i
shall
insist
upon
that
if
i
engage
you
replied
desmond
you
will
tuck
it
up
and
wear
a
nurse
cap
over
it
have
you
any
recommendations
to
give
with
her
mrs
markham
she
continued
expectantly
no
for
mary
has
never
been
in
service
before
replied
the
kind
lady
she
is
a
young
southern
girl
seeking
employment
in
this
city
and
i
should
like
to
befriend
her
if
possible
i
fancied
that
her
gentle
innocent
face
might
recommend
her
to
your
favor
as
it
did
to
mine
desmond
turned
to
look
at
golden
again
and
met
the
gaze
of
the
soft
blue
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
a
kind
of
puzzled
intentness
child
why
do
you
stare
at
me
so
curiously
she
inquired
the
deep
color
rushed
into
golden
face
making
her
more
lovely
than
ever
i
beg
your
pardon
she
hastened
to
say
falteringly
you
remind
me
so
much
of
someone
i
have
known
that
i
could
not
keep
from
looking
at
your
face
it
was
very
rude
i
know
never
mind
i
am
not
angry
answered
desmond
do
you
think
you
would
make
a
good
patient
nurse
for
my
little
girl
mary
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
little
golden
replied
in
her
gentle
refined
voice
desmond
looked
at
her
friend
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
engaging
help
without
recommendation
it
is
rather
a
risk
to
run
she
remarked
but
to
please
you
my
friend
and
because
i
really
need
a
maid
for
ruby
i
will
give
mary
smith
a
trial
when
can
you
come
mary
she
can
stay
now
if
you
like
edith
said
markham
that
will
suit
me
very
well
said
desmond
i
will
engage
you
for
one
month
at
least
mary
and
i
will
pay
you
ten
dollars
a
month
will
that
suit
you
yes
thank
you
golden
answered
timidly
very
well
you
may
stay
now
and
you
may
go
at
once
to
ruby
for
i
have
been
compelled
to
lend
her
my
own
maid
for
a
week
past
and
she
is
so
dissatisfied
with
the
position
that
she
threatens
to
leave
me
if
she
is
not
relieved
i
can
assure
you
that
you
will
find
your
position
no
sinecure
i
hope
you
will
try
to
find
means
to
amuse
the
child
you
must
be
very
kind
and
patient
with
her
mary
i
allow
no
scolding
or
for
my
little
girl
is
very
frail
and
delicate
golden
rose
and
stood
waiting
while
the
languid
fine
lady
talked
when
she
had
ended
her
little
speech
she
pointed
her
white
finger
at
the
door
go
through
the
she
said
into
my
you
will
find
that
it
has
a
door
connecting
with
the
nursery
you
will
find
my
little
daughter
in
there
you
may
introduce
yourself
to
her
markham
and
i
will
look
in
presently
and
see
how
ruby
is
pleased
with
you
try
and
make
a
good
impression
on
the
little
one
mind
at
first
said
markham
kindly
first
impressions
are
everything
with
children
beautiful
golden
thanked
her
with
a
grateful
look
and
silently
withdrew
to
follow
desmond
instructions
you
do
not
seem
as
pleased
as
i
had
expected
edith
markham
said
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
when
they
were
alone
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
the
girl
is
too
pretty
desmond
replied
with
some
embarrassment
i
thought
you
liked
pretty
things
about
you
said
her
friend
so
i
do
but
i
do
not
like
pretty
servants
was
the
significant
reply
as
a
rule
they
are
vain
and
trifling
and
do
not
attend
to
their
business
they
are
always
looking
out
to
attract
admiration
to
their
pretty
faces
i
do
not
believe
that
mary
smith
is
one
of
that
kind
said
markham
she
seems
a
good
simple
innocent
girl
but
if
she
fails
to
suit
you
edith
you
may
return
her
to
me
and
i
will
find
some
other
place
for
her
i
imagined
that
you
would
be
delighted
with
such
a
girl
for
ruby
attendant
and
so
i
am
and
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
i
hope
that
she
will
please
ruby
better
than
the
girls
we
have
had
lately
for
i
feel
quite
worn
out
with
anxiety
over
the
dear
little
creature
replied
desmond
but
so
constrained
that
markham
saw
that
she
was
only
in
her
pleasure
and
wondered
why
it
was
that
golden
beauty
which
was
so
attractive
to
her
own
eyes
was
distasteful
to
desmond
who
was
beautiful
herself
and
liked
to
gather
beautiful
things
around
her
it
is
said
that
every
family
has
its
skeleton
markham
did
not
know
that
the
skeleton
in
her
friend
closet
was
the
lurking
fiend
of
jealousy
desmond
was
a
charming
lady
but
she
secretly
disliked
every
pretty
woman
she
knew
little
golden
went
on
through
the
to
the
which
was
a
perfect
bower
of
elegance
and
repose
and
timidly
opened
the
nursery
door
for
the
description
of
little
ruby
desmond
had
rather
intimidated
her
she
found
herself
in
a
large
airy
sunny
chamber
splendidly
adapted
for
a
nursery
and
luxuriously
fitted
up
for
that
purpose
in
a
low
a
smart
french
maid
was
indolently
lounging
and
yawning
over
a
french
novel
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
little
girl
of
six
years
small
for
her
age
and
pale
and
was
sobbing
fretfully
in
a
fit
of
the
sulks
she
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
looked
up
curiously
at
the
timid
intruder
who
are
you
she
demanded
abruptly
i
am
mary
smith
your
new
nurse
little
miss
ruby
said
golden
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
and
with
a
winning
smile
the
french
maid
threw
down
her
novel
and
stared
and
little
ruby
came
out
of
her
corner
so
you
are
my
new
maid
are
you
she
asked
pertly
well
i
hope
you
will
not
be
as
hateful
as
celine
here
is
for
if
you
do
i
shall
be
sure
to
throw
my
top
at
your
head
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
for
i
am
perfectly
tired
of
celine
and
i
want
her
to
leave
me
at
once
at
once
do
you
hear
me
celine
celine
flounced
out
of
the
room
in
a
huff
and
the
little
one
continued
there
is
one
comfort
you
are
not
as
ugly
as
celine
and
the
others
i
hate
ugly
people
and
so
does
my
papa
but
mamma
likes
them
best
are
the
prettiest
nurse
i
ever
saw
you
look
just
like
my
big
wax
doll
with
your
blue
eyes
and
long
hair
nurses
always
wear
their
hair
under
a
cap
did
you
not
know
that
little
golden
did
not
answer
one
word
to
the
voluble
discourse
of
the
spoiled
child
she
stood
silently
in
the
center
of
the
large
apartment
her
small
hand
pressed
to
her
beating
heart
her
pale
lips
apart
her
blue
eyes
upraised
to
a
large
portrait
that
hung
against
the
wall
in
a
splendid
frame
of
gold
and
ebony
the
dark
handsome
splendid
face
that
smiled
down
upon
her
was
the
face
of
her
lost
lover
bertram
chesleigh
chapter
xviii
fortunately
for
golden
little
ruby
desmond
did
not
observe
the
preoccupation
of
her
new
nurse
she
had
entered
upon
a
voluble
tirade
against
nurses
in
general
and
when
she
had
ended
she
remarked
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
but
i
do
believe
i
shall
hate
you
as
much
as
i
did
the
rest
you
are
younger
and
prettier
than
any
girl
i
ever
had
to
amuse
me
come
now
mary
lay
off
your
hat
and
jacket
i
want
you
to
make
my
doll
a
new
dress
that
lazy
celine
would
not
stick
a
needle
in
it
for
all
i
stormed
and
scolded
and
threatened
to
complain
to
mamma
thus
adjured
golden
turned
her
eyes
with
an
effort
away
from
the
portrait
of
bertram
chesleigh
and
proceeded
to
obey
the
instructions
of
her
little
mistress
with
what
cheerfulness
she
could
although
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
with
the
shock
she
had
received
on
coming
suddenly
face
to
face
with
her
lover
portrait
in
this
strange
place
she
longed
yet
dreaded
to
ask
little
ruby
what
the
original
of
the
portrait
was
to
her
looking
from
the
portrait
to
the
child
she
could
plainly
discern
in
ruby
proud
mouth
and
flashing
dark
eyes
a
great
and
striking
resemblance
to
chesleigh
but
she
was
afraid
to
ask
the
question
that
trembled
on
her
lips
so
she
sat
down
mutely
while
ruby
brought
a
large
wax
doll
and
placed
it
in
her
lap
together
with
a
large
quantity
of
scraps
of
silk
and
muslin
and
odds
and
ends
of
pretty
lace
then
she
pulled
open
the
drawer
of
a
child
bureau
and
brought
out
a
garnet
silk
dress
of
her
own
elaborately
made
and
trimmed
i
want
dollie
dress
made
exactly
like
this
she
said
hanging
it
open
over
the
back
of
a
chair
for
golden
inspection
it
is
in
the
latest
fashion
so
celine
says
celine
thinks
of
nothing
but
french
novels
and
fashions
so
she
ought
to
know
your
doll
is
very
beautiful
is
it
a
new
one
asked
golden
trying
to
say
something
to
please
the
little
creature
who
was
hovering
about
her
busy
and
excited
with
her
important
preparations
for
the
miniature
dressmaking
oh
yes
it
is
tolerably
new
papa
gave
it
to
me
last
week
replied
ruby
there
was
a
little
trunk
of
clothes
with
her
but
i
do
not
like
any
of
the
dresses
they
are
quite
and
shabby
i
think
mamma
says
herself
that
they
must
have
been
made
at
least
a
year
ago
so
i
shall
never
be
satisfied
until
i
have
a
dress
for
dollie
she
was
silent
a
moment
watching
golden
deft
finger
as
they
slowly
cut
and
basted
then
she
resumed
i
have
tried
and
tried
but
i
can
not
think
of
a
name
for
her
can
you
tell
me
a
pretty
name
for
her
mary
would
you
like
to
call
her
golden
asked
the
girl
feeling
as
if
the
sound
of
her
own
name
would
be
a
relief
in
this
new
strange
atmosphere
golden
what
a
pretty
name
said
the
child
i
like
that
i
will
call
dollie
by
that
name
i
shall
be
golden
golden
chesleigh
she
added
after
a
minute
thought
the
new
nurse
started
so
violently
that
the
doll
dress
fell
from
her
fingers
the
lovely
crimson
color
rushed
into
her
face
chesleigh
why
do
you
call
her
that
she
asked
falteringly
do
you
know
anybody
by
that
name
miss
ruby
the
little
girl
laughed
quite
happily
well
i
should
think
i
did
she
said
brightly
my
own
uncle
is
named
chesleigh
bertram
chesleigh
there
is
his
portrait
on
the
wall
look
at
it
mary
and
tell
me
if
he
is
not
me
very
handsomest
man
you
ever
beheld
golden
looked
up
into
the
dark
eyes
that
had
gazed
into
her
own
so
fondly
and
at
the
proud
yet
tender
lips
that
had
kissed
her
with
such
passionate
love
and
she
could
barely
repress
the
moan
of
pain
that
came
from
her
lips
yes
he
is
very
handsome
she
said
faintly
does
he
ever
call
here
to
see
you
oh
yes
often
and
often
when
he
is
at
home
said
ruby
but
he
is
gone
away
traveling
in
the
sunny
south
now
he
travels
a
great
deal
mamma
calls
him
a
bird
of
passage
is
he
fond
of
you
said
golden
seeing
that
she
was
expected
to
say
something
oh
yes
very
fond
said
ruby
brightening
up
so
much
that
golden
saw
it
was
a
favorite
subject
with
her
he
had
that
splendid
portrait
painted
expressly
for
a
present
to
me
mamma
begged
me
to
let
it
hang
in
the
but
i
would
not
i
told
her
i
would
have
it
in
the
nursery
where
i
could
see
it
every
minute
is
he
married
asked
golden
carelessly
to
all
appearance
and
taking
up
her
work
again
oh
dear
no
and
i
hope
he
never
will
be
he
loves
me
better
than
anyone
now
but
he
would
like
his
wife
best
if
he
were
married
cried
the
spoiled
child
golden
sighed
softly
and
made
no
reply
and
the
entrance
of
desmond
and
her
visitor
interrupted
the
conversation
markham
you
see
i
have
a
new
nurse
said
ruby
looking
up
with
a
faint
flush
of
pleasant
excitement
on
her
delicate
face
you
have
to
thank
markham
for
bringing
her
to
you
said
desmond
glad
to
see
a
smile
on
the
usually
sullen
or
little
white
face
ruby
went
forward
and
kissed
markham
charmingly
as
if
she
was
always
loving
and
instead
of
and
capricious
as
everyone
represented
her
i
thank
you
very
much
she
said
i
think
i
shall
like
mary
better
than
the
others
she
is
very
kind
and
obliging
you
see
she
is
making
a
new
dress
for
my
doll
celine
was
too
lazy
she
would
not
dress
my
doll
at
all
markham
gave
her
an
encouraging
smile
and
golden
blushed
with
pleasure
she
has
given
my
new
doll
a
name
continued
ruby
vivaciously
it
is
golden
do
you
not
think
it
pretty
the
name
would
suit
mary
herself
i
think
as
she
has
such
lovely
curls
i
believe
i
shall
call
her
goldilocks
she
added
laying
her
small
hand
caressingly
on
hair
markham
smiled
indulgently
but
her
friend
looked
annoyed
indeed
ruby
you
must
not
call
her
by
such
a
silly
name
she
said
she
must
put
her
hair
up
and
wear
a
little
cup
over
it
like
a
french
it
is
a
pity
to
cover
it
up
it
is
so
thick
and
long
and
shines
so
bright
mary
is
a
very
pretty
girl
do
you
think
so
mamma
she
looks
just
like
my
wax
doll
said
the
child
pretty
is
that
pretty
does
my
child
desmond
answered
shortly
and
markham
stooping
over
golden
put
a
card
with
her
name
and
address
upon
it
in
her
hand
and
said
in
her
kind
patronizing
voice
if
you
do
not
suit
desmond
mary
after
she
has
given
you
a
fair
trial
you
may
come
to
me
and
i
will
help
you
to
another
place
the
quick
tears
brimmed
over
in
little
golden
eyes
she
kissed
markham
hand
in
silent
gratitude
it
is
quite
likely
i
shall
keep
her
if
she
continues
to
please
ruby
as
well
as
she
does
now
but
ruby
is
such
a
capricious
little
darling
there
is
no
telling
how
soon
this
new
fancy
of
hers
may
change
brooms
sweep
clean
you
know
said
desmond
quoting
the
old
adage
a
little
stiffly
markham
made
some
careless
reply
and
took
her
departure
she
was
vaguely
conscious
of
a
chill
never
felt
before
in
manner
and
resented
her
lack
of
gratitude
for
the
service
she
had
done
her
the
child
is
so
pleased
and
interested
it
will
be
quite
a
pity
if
she
sends
mary
smith
away
from
her
the
benevolent
woman
thought
silently
to
herself
chapter
xix
i
am
quite
sure
that
my
papa
will
be
pleased
with
your
looks
said
little
ruby
artlessly
when
her
mother
had
gone
out
and
left
them
alone
to
the
doll
dressmaking
he
likes
pretty
faces
as
well
as
i
do
he
hates
celine
and
the
chambermaid
both
because
as
he
says
they
are
deucedly
ugly
i
suppose
papa
loves
his
little
pet
very
much
said
golden
smiling
sadly
at
the
little
one
prattle
yes
indeed
said
ruby
he
gives
me
oceans
of
pretty
things
but
i
do
not
see
him
much
only
an
hour
after
dinner
you
see
papa
and
mamma
are
both
very
gay
they
always
go
out
in
the
evening
to
balls
or
operas
before
the
dinner
hour
celine
made
her
appearance
with
a
large
white
and
neat
cap
for
golden
use
my
mistress
sent
you
these
she
said
not
unkindly
shall
i
show
you
how
to
use
them
or
do
you
know
already
you
will
please
show
me
the
girl
answered
gently
celine
brought
combs
and
brushes
and
arranged
the
bright
shining
hair
in
a
thick
plait
which
she
wound
about
the
small
head
and
pinned
securely
with
hairpins
she
said
unable
to
repress
an
involuntary
tribute
of
admiration
you
have
the
most
beautiful
hair
i
ever
saw
yes
and
it
a
shame
to
put
a
cap
on
it
cried
ruby
i
think
mamma
is
very
unkind
to
me
i
did
not
want
mary
smith
beautiful
hair
covered
fie
my
little
lady
what
a
she
would
be
without
her
little
cap
cried
celine
as
she
put
the
last
touches
to
the
bib
and
cap
thank
you
said
golden
as
she
gave
a
timid
glance
into
the
swinging
mirror
celine
noted
the
little
incident
with
feminine
quickness
and
smiled
should
you
know
yourself
again
she
asked
it
makes
a
great
difference
in
my
appearance
little
golden
replied
but
it
does
not
make
you
any
less
pretty
declared
celine
when
your
hair
hung
down
it
hid
all
your
neck
now
i
see
that
your
ears
are
as
pretty
as
and
your
neck
as
white
as
snow
you
are
too
for
your
place
miss
smith
and
you
are
too
ugly
for
yours
put
in
ruby
sharply
hold
your
tongue
miss
pert
said
the
french
maid
with
an
ugly
frown
it
a
deal
better
to
be
an
ugly
servant
than
a
pretty
one
in
this
place
and
so
miss
smith
will
find
out
before
long
not
as
i
says
it
out
of
spite
for
the
poor
thing
she
to
be
pitied
being
nurse
pronounced
mademoiselle
celine
as
she
flitted
out
of
the
room
seeing
that
golden
made
her
no
answer
indeed
the
poor
girl
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
was
puzzled
and
frightened
over
the
maid
pert
innuendoes
but
she
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
what
she
meant
when
celine
was
gone
she
looked
into
the
minor
again
and
then
at
the
portrait
on
the
wall
the
hot
tears
came
into
the
great
blue
eyes
and
blinded
them
oh
bert
she
whispered
inaudibly
would
you
know
me
would
you
love
me
in
this
strange
and
altered
guise
you
must
do
my
hair
over
before
dinner
mary
said
the
little
girl
i
always
dine
with
mamma
and
papa
when
they
have
no
company
you
will
go
with
me
and
stand
behind
my
chair
while
i
am
eating
to
attend
to
my
wants
golden
gave
a
gasp
of
mingled
pride
and
dread
must
i
indeed
do
that
she
asked
oh
yes
all
my
nurses
do
that
way
said
the
child
now
mary
i
must
have
my
hair
curled
over
and
dress
for
dinner
just
as
mamma
does
you
know
golden
found
that
she
had
a
most
exacting
little
mistress
although
frail
and
diseased
the
little
creature
never
allowed
her
active
mind
and
thin
little
body
one
moment
rest
she
was
always
flying
from
one
thing
to
another
and
kept
everyone
about
her
attending
to
her
whims
and
fancied
wants
yet
in
spite
of
her
capricious
exactions
golden
could
not
help
being
drawn
to
the
child
the
dark
eyes
and
the
proud
sweet
mouth
so
like
those
of
the
man
she
loved
won
her
in
spite
of
herself
at
dinner
where
she
stood
droopingly
behind
little
ruby
chair
the
master
of
the
house
did
not
even
glance
toward
her
so
that
she
had
a
fair
chance
to
observe
him
from
under
her
heavy
curling
lashes
the
scrutiny
did
not
satisfy
her
although
she
could
not
have
told
how
it
chanced
for
desmond
was
faultlessly
handsome
he
had
a
fair
effeminate
face
full
of
languid
passion
and
those
large
gray
eyes
which
can
shoot
the
most
killing
glances
his
hair
was
parted
in
the
middle
with
scrupulous
exactness
his
dress
was
elegant
to
the
verge
of
foppishness
and
a
magnificent
diamond
sparkled
on
his
white
hand
his
wife
and
little
daughter
seemed
to
regard
him
with
the
most
admiring
affection
which
he
accepted
with
a
bored
and
rather
patronizing
air
when
the
long
and
ceremonious
dinner
was
over
little
ruby
sprang
down
from
her
chair
and
caught
his
hand
come
papa
come
mamma
she
cried
you
must
go
to
the
nursery
now
they
went
away
with
her
and
when
golden
returned
to
the
nursery
later
she
found
the
little
girl
sitting
on
her
father
knee
and
chatting
volubly
to
him
while
desmond
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
ruby
jumped
down
from
her
perch
and
ran
to
golden
papa
she
said
evidently
referring
to
some
subject
they
had
been
discussing
i
will
show
it
to
you
and
you
will
say
that
i
am
right
with
a
quick
deft
motion
she
pulled
the
cap
from
golden
head
and
loosened
the
braid
so
that
the
curling
rippling
mass
of
gold
fell
in
a
shower
of
beauty
over
the
girl
shoulders
then
she
cried
out
in
gleeful
triumph
is
it
lovely
papa
did
you
ever
see
such
a
pretty
nurse
desmond
looked
in
amazement
at
the
blushing
shrinking
girl
and
murmured
inaudibly
ye
gods
what
a
perfect
beauty
at
that
moment
the
brilliant
brunette
desmond
swept
into
the
room
with
a
waft
of
exquisite
perfume
her
diamonds
glittering
her
rich
silk
and
laces
rustling
majestically
a
white
satin
opera
cloak
folded
gracefully
around
her
white
shoulders
she
looked
at
golden
so
wrathfully
that
it
froze
the
quick
murmur
of
irrepressible
admiration
on
her
lips
girl
what
does
this
disordered
appearance
mean
why
is
your
hair
down
after
my
strict
orders
she
demanded
angrily
your
daughter
pulled
it
down
madam
golden
answered
with
outward
dignity
and
quietness
though
she
was
inwardly
chafed
and
deeply
wounded
desmond
turned
round
in
a
gust
of
passion
and
gave
ruby
a
ringing
slap
on
the
cheek
with
her
white
jeweled
hand
take
that
and
behave
yourself
better
the
next
time
she
cried
sharply
ruby
ran
screaming
to
her
father
and
desmond
cried
out
impatiently
come
desmond
the
carriage
is
waiting
mary
put
the
child
to
bed
ruby
she
bent
to
kiss
the
child
but
ruby
pushed
her
away
with
an
angry
scream
and
ran
to
hide
her
face
in
golden
skirts
desmond
turned
away
followed
by
her
husband
who
said
reproachfully
as
they
passed
from
the
room
you
were
needlessly
cruel
to
the
poor
little
thing
edith
my
dear
chapter
xx
desmond
came
into
the
nursery
the
next
morning
with
her
arms
full
of
new
toys
as
a
propitiatory
gift
to
her
offended
little
daughter
she
greeted
golden
very
kindly
feeling
ashamed
of
her
petulance
of
the
evening
before
when
she
saw
how
patiently
she
was
ministering
to
the
comfort
of
her
little
daughter
little
ruby
was
suffering
with
a
headache
this
morning
she
lay
on
a
silken
lounge
with
her
head
propped
on
pillows
and
golden
was
bathing
the
hot
temples
with
de
are
you
still
pleased
with
your
nurse
my
darling
inquired
her
mother
oh
yes
mamma
mary
is
the
kindest
nurse
i
ever
had
answered
ruby
lifting
her
heavy
eyes
tenderly
to
golden
sweet
face
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
her
mother
does
your
head
ache
too
bad
for
you
to
take
your
morning
drive
with
me
dear
oh
no
i
think
it
will
be
better
when
i
get
out
in
the
air
said
ruby
with
a
brightening
face
shall
we
take
my
nurse
with
us
not
this
morning
i
think
as
i
shall
drive
the
and
there
is
only
room
for
two
will
not
papa
go
then
said
the
child
disappointed
no
he
has
a
business
engagement
and
can
not
accompany
us
you
see
we
are
going
to
the
seaside
next
week
and
he
has
a
great
many
things
to
see
to
first
desmond
answered
with
the
child
disappointment
reflected
on
her
own
beautiful
face
she
loved
her
husband
with
the
devotion
of
a
strong
intense
nature
and
begrudged
every
moment
he
spent
away
from
her
side
her
jealousy
was
as
strong
as
her
love
and
desmond
was
the
type
of
man
best
calculated
to
keep
this
baleful
passion
in
the
fullest
play
he
had
been
noted
as
a
male
flirt
before
he
married
edith
chesleigh
and
his
conduct
since
their
union
had
not
been
of
a
sort
to
strengthen
his
wife
faith
in
his
fidelity
beautiful
as
she
was
herself
she
soon
found
that
he
was
by
no
means
blind
to
the
charms
of
other
women
she
turned
to
the
nurse
with
a
suppressed
sigh
and
said
quietly
you
may
dress
ruby
now
in
a
white
hat
and
dress
and
cardinal
sash
while
i
am
getting
ready
then
she
kissed
ruby
and
went
to
her
golden
hastened
to
follow
her
instructions
we
shall
go
to
the
seaside
next
week
and
stay
two
months
shall
you
like
that
mary
asked
the
child
while
golden
was
brushing
her
dark
curls
over
her
fingers
i
dare
say
i
shall
like
it
if
you
do
replied
the
girl
oh
we
will
have
a
splendid
time
we
will
go
bathing
in
the
sea
in
the
mornings
and
afterward
we
will
stroll
on
the
sands
and
gather
beautiful
rosy
shells
at
night
they
have
balls
and
dancing
sometimes
mamma
lets
me
stay
up
awhile
to
see
them
dance
oh
it
is
grand
fun
i
wish
i
was
a
grown
lady
cried
the
child
flapping
her
hands
golden
listened
in
silence
and
the
strange
loneliness
and
quietude
of
the
life
in
which
she
had
been
reared
struck
her
more
and
more
by
its
contrast
with
the
bright
bustling
world
outside
and
beyond
glenalvan
hall
when
little
ruby
had
gone
away
for
her
drive
with
her
mother
she
sat
down
in
the
quiet
nursery
and
resigned
herself
to
thought
her
thought
went
back
to
the
gray
old
hall
in
the
sunny
south
and
the
kind
old
man
she
had
deserted
she
wondered
if
he
would
forgive
her
and
pray
for
her
that
she
might
find
her
mother
i
shall
never
find
her
now
she
thought
i
have
lost
my
money
and
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
can
earn
enough
to
resign
my
situation
here
and
try
to
find
her
markham
was
so
sweet
and
kind
i
wonder
if
she
would
help
me
but
no
she
would
scorn
me
like
all
the
rest
if
she
knew
the
story
of
my
poor
young
mother
disgrace
little
mary
where
is
my
daughter
this
morning
said
a
clear
musical
voice
golden
looked
up
with
a
start
and
saw
desmond
standing
tall
debonair
and
handsome
in
the
center
of
the
lofty
apartment
he
had
entered
and
closed
the
door
so
softly
that
she
had
not
heard
a
sound
miss
ruby
has
gone
out
driving
with
her
mother
she
answered
ah
said
desmond
i
suppose
she
will
not
be
gone
long
so
i
will
wait
here
until
she
returns
he
drew
forward
a
chair
quite
close
to
hers
golden
regarded
him
in
surprise
miss
ruby
was
very
anxious
that
you
should
go
with
her
but
her
mother
said
you
had
a
business
engagement
this
morning
and
could
not
find
time
to
gratify
her
she
remarked
to
him
rather
pointedly
he
flushed
then
laughed
carelessly
oh
yes
so
i
did
have
he
replied
i
only
looked
in
a
minute
to
bid
ruby
yes
sir
the
nurse
replied
constrainedly
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
way
desmond
regarded
her
out
of
his
large
bold
eyes
made
her
feel
slightly
nervous
she
heartily
wished
that
he
would
go
away
and
leave
her
alone
but
desmond
seemed
in
no
haste
to
fulfill
his
business
engagement
he
sat
silently
a
moment
regarding
the
delicate
profile
of
the
half
averted
face
then
said
carelessly
where
do
you
come
from
mary
new
york
i
am
from
the
south
desmond
said
the
girl
biting
her
lips
to
keep
back
her
resentment
at
his
familiar
address
indeed
from
what
part
of
the
south
he
inquired
excuse
me
sir
i
do
not
care
to
reveal
my
private
affairs
to
a
total
stranger
replied
golden
with
such
sudden
spirit
and
haughtiness
that
the
fine
gentleman
stared
whew
he
exclaimed
i
did
not
mean
any
offense
miss
smith
i
only
wished
to
know
the
precise
spot
where
such
peerless
beauties
as
yourself
are
reared
i
would
certainly
immigrate
instanter
to
that
most
precious
locality
golden
rose
crimson
with
anger
and
crossed
to
the
door
where
are
you
going
he
inquired
following
her
and
taking
hold
of
her
hand
i
am
going
down
stairs
desmond
she
replied
coldly
and
trying
to
wrench
her
hand
away
are
you
offended
at
my
plain
speaking
he
inquired
trying
to
look
into
her
flashing
eyes
surely
you
are
aware
that
you
are
beautiful
if
i
am
it
does
not
become
you
to
tell
me
so
sir
she
replied
resentfully
such
compliments
belong
to
your
wife
my
wife
is
a
beautiful
woman
but
not
half
so
beautiful
as
you
are
little
mary
he
replied
still
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
her
hand
desmond
let
me
go
she
pleaded
the
angry
tears
crowding
into
her
soft
blue
eyes
i
will
not
listen
to
such
words
from
you
you
are
cruel
and
unkind
what
would
desmond
say
if
she
could
see
you
he
started
uneasily
then
laughed
she
would
say
i
was
only
teasing
you
as
i
was
he
replied
believe
me
mary
i
was
only
joking
you
i
did
not
think
that
you
would
take
it
as
earnest
or
become
angry
say
that
you
forgive
me
fair
one
and
i
will
release
you
let
go
my
hand
i
forgive
you
golden
replied
glad
to
be
released
on
any
terms
and
shrinking
from
him
with
an
utter
loathing
and
horror
thank
you
for
your
pardon
he
cried
laughingly
you
must
seal
the
sweet
pledge
with
a
kiss
my
lovely
girl
he
threw
his
arm
around
her
struggling
little
form
clasping
her
closely
to
his
breast
and
pressed
a
full
passionate
kiss
on
her
loathing
lips
chapter
xxi
at
golden
loud
scream
of
alarm
and
anger
the
door
of
sleeping
apartment
opened
suddenly
and
celine
the
maid
stood
aghast
upon
the
threshold
she
beheld
the
pretty
new
nurse
in
the
arms
of
her
master
saw
his
handsome
head
bent
over
her
as
he
kissed
the
beautiful
crimson
lips
at
celine
startled
cry
he
turned
upon
her
fiercely
at
the
same
time
releasing
golden
what
do
you
mean
by
spying
upon
my
actions
celine
he
demanded
angrily
pardon
monsieur
i
meant
no
offense
said
the
maid
as
smooth
as
silk
i
but
thought
you
were
romping
with
little
miss
ruby
and
looked
in
to
behold
the
little
one
delight
desmond
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
conciliate
mademoiselle
celine
i
did
come
in
to
see
ruby
he
replied
but
she
had
gone
to
ride
so
i
attempted
a
bit
of
harmless
gallantry
with
her
nurse
here
such
as
most
pretty
girls
would
have
taken
with
pleasure
but
she
was
timid
and
frightened
at
my
little
joke
hold
your
tongue
about
it
celine
and
here
a
trifle
to
buy
you
a
new
cap
he
tossed
a
gold
piece
at
her
feet
and
celine
picked
it
up
curtsying
and
smiling
little
golden
standing
apart
from
them
regarded
the
scene
with
horror
and
disgust
desmond
turning
suddenly
to
her
quailed
at
the
look
of
fiery
scorn
in
the
beautiful
spirited
young
face
are
you
very
angry
with
me
mary
he
inquired
in
a
subdued
voice
no
words
can
do
justice
to
my
contempt
for
you
she
replied
in
a
voice
of
cutting
scorn
how
dared
you
maltreat
and
insult
me
so
shame
on
you
for
your
cruelty
to
a
poor
and
helpless
girl
she
was
so
beautiful
in
her
anger
that
he
could
scarcely
remove
his
gaze
from
her
face
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
her
eyes
were
darkened
and
dilated
with
anger
her
lovely
lips
were
curled
disdainfully
he
read
the
proud
purity
of
her
young
soul
in
every
haughty
movement
of
her
lithe
young
figure
and
clenched
white
hands
he
regarded
her
in
silence
a
moment
then
exclaimed
with
apparent
frankness
mary
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
pardon
my
conduct
my
wife
told
me
that
she
had
engaged
you
totally
without
recommendation
and
we
both
were
afraid
that
we
had
run
too
great
a
risk
in
intrusting
our
little
darling
to
your
care
i
determined
therefore
to
test
you
i
have
done
so
and
i
am
delighted
to
find
that
your
principles
and
your
virtue
are
so
steadfast
and
true
are
you
willing
to
grant
me
your
pardon
after
this
explanation
at
this
specious
apology
the
simple
girl
looked
from
the
anxious
face
to
that
of
the
maid
celine
being
a
woman
she
reasoned
would
tell
her
whether
to
accept
this
explanation
or
not
the
artful
maid
gave
her
an
encouraging
smile
monsieur
is
right
she
said
he
did
well
to
test
your
principles
miss
smith
do
not
be
so
rude
as
to
withhold
your
forgiveness
after
his
manly
apology
golden
with
her
slight
knowledge
of
the
wicked
world
thought
that
desmond
and
celine
had
told
her
the
truth
she
answered
falteringly
after
a
moment
of
silence
then
i
will
forgive
you
desmond
if
you
will
promise
not
to
molest
me
again
otherwise
i
shall
return
to
markham
protection
you
must
not
think
of
leaving
us
ruby
is
so
pleased
with
you
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
desert
her
you
need
not
fear
me
i
am
quite
satisfied
of
your
truth
and
worth
and
my
wife
will
be
delighted
when
i
tell
her
how
nobly
i
have
proved
your
virtue
said
desmond
hastily
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
muttering
something
about
his
business
engagement
hurried
away
celine
looked
at
golden
with
an
odd
significant
smile
now
miss
smith
you
understand
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
you
were
too
for
your
place
she
said
but
i
thought
said
and
so
did
you
celine
that
he
was
only
testing
my
virtue
said
poor
golden
in
perplexity
bah
that
was
only
master
blarney
replied
celine
airily
of
course
i
had
to
agree
with
him
or
lose
my
situation
and
i
choose
to
do
that
for
i
have
a
good
place
and
lots
of
perquisites
but
the
truth
is
that
monsieur
only
invented
that
tale
of
testing
you
because
he
was
frightened
when
he
found
he
had
tackled
an
honest
girl
and
he
did
not
wish
for
the
madam
to
get
hold
of
it
then
he
is
a
wicked
villain
and
i
shall
go
away
cried
the
girl
indignantly
i
love
little
ruby
but
i
will
go
away
i
can
not
remain
if
you
take
advice
you
will
stay
and
say
nothing
about
it
replied
the
maid
if
you
go
to
another
place
you
are
just
as
likely
to
encounter
the
same
difficulty
you
are
too
pretty
to
be
a
servant
i
have
told
you
that
already
but
i
can
not
remain
here
and
encounter
the
persecutions
of
desmond
replied
golden
decidedly
i
do
not
believe
he
will
annoy
you
again
said
celine
confidently
he
has
found
out
that
you
are
honest
and
he
will
be
afraid
to
pursue
you
any
further
the
child
is
so
pleased
with
you
it
would
be
a
pity
to
forsake
her
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
monsieur
is
too
much
afraid
of
his
wife
to
bother
you
again
why
she
is
so
jealous
that
if
she
knew
her
husband
had
kissed
you
she
would
want
to
cut
your
ears
off
golden
shivered
at
celine
vivid
words
it
is
better
i
should
go
then
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
would
not
for
the
world
create
trouble
between
husband
and
wife
you
had
better
stay
said
celine
i
shall
not
tell
of
you
and
you
may
be
pretty
sure
master
wo
so
desmond
need
never
know
it
is
better
i
should
go
said
golden
decidedly
and
then
she
threw
herself
down
upon
a
lounge
and
burst
into
tears
oh
why
are
women
so
weak
and
men
so
cruel
she
wildly
sobbed
it
their
nature
replied
celine
but
golden
made
her
no
answer
she
only
continued
to
weep
i
am
the
most
miserable
girl
on
earth
she
sobbed
i
wish
that
i
had
never
been
born
the
maid
curiosity
was
greatly
excited
by
golden
words
she
knelt
down
by
the
girl
and
inquired
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
and
promised
her
her
friendship
and
advice
if
she
would
confide
in
her
but
in
golden
pure
mind
there
was
an
instinctive
distrust
of
celine
her
ready
acceptance
of
her
master
bribe
had
excited
her
disgust
and
dislike
she
answered
evasively
that
she
had
nothing
to
confide
and
only
desired
to
be
left
in
peace
oh
very
well
miss
replied
the
maid
you
can
be
left
alone
sure
but
you
find
that
it
better
to
make
a
friend
of
celine
duval
than
an
enemy
she
flounced
out
of
the
room
as
she
spoke
and
golden
was
left
alone
to
the
companionship
of
her
own
sad
thoughts
she
lay
silently
a
long
while
looking
at
the
portrait
of
bertram
chesleigh
and
weeping
bitter
tears
over
her
unhappy
fate
how
beautiful
and
was
the
picture
the
blissful
hours
she
had
spent
with
the
original
rushed
over
her
mind
making
the
contrast
with
the
gloom
of
the
present
more
harrowing
she
found
herself
exclaiming
oh
that
those
lips
had
language
life
has
passed
with
me
but
roughly
since
i
heard
them
last
but
no
sound
came
from
the
lips
of
the
lover
who
had
given
her
a
few
hours
of
happiness
only
to
leave
her
to
the
darkness
of
despair
chapter
xxii
golden
had
quite
decided
in
her
mind
that
she
would
rather
leave
desmond
at
once
than
risk
a
renewal
of
her
husband
distasteful
attentions
but
little
ruby
first
words
on
returning
from
her
drive
dispelled
the
idea
for
the
present
at
least
from
her
thoughts
oh
mary
the
little
one
had
cried
with
childish
directness
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
oh
mary
i
have
heard
bad
news
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
dear
said
golden
gently
ruby
looked
up
into
the
face
of
her
uncle
where
it
hung
against
the
wall
oh
poor
uncle
bertie
she
sighed
was
it
about
chesleigh
ruby
she
inquired
yes
said
the
child
mamma
has
had
a
telegram
from
some
people
about
him
he
is
very
sick
and
he
is
away
down
south
at
a
place
called
glenalvan
hall
golden
drew
her
breath
heavily
and
sank
into
a
chair
it
seemed
as
if
an
arrow
had
pierced
her
heart
she
could
not
speak
but
stared
at
ruby
with
a
dumb
misery
in
her
eyes
that
the
little
one
could
in
nowise
understand
some
of
us
will
have
to
go
to
him
mamma
and
papa
i
suppose
continued
ruby
i
asked
mamma
to
let
me
go
but
she
says
it
would
be
too
warm
for
me
at
this
time
of
the
year
in
the
south
because
i
am
so
delicate
is
he
very
sick
will
he
die
inquired
golden
speaking
in
a
strange
unnatural
voice
they
hope
not
but
he
is
very
sick
said
ruby
and
at
that
moment
desmond
swept
into
the
room
her
bright
eyes
looked
dim
and
heavy
as
though
she
might
have
been
weeping
i
am
very
sorry
you
have
had
bad
news
madam
said
golden
trying
to
appear
quiet
and
natural
though
her
pulse
was
beating
at
and
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
dim
beneath
their
drooping
lashes
ruby
has
told
you
of
my
brother
illness
then
said
desmond
more
gently
than
she
usually
spoke
to
her
dependents
yes
madam
said
golden
faintly
unable
to
utter
another
word
he
has
brain
fever
said
desmond
despondently
desmond
will
leave
for
the
south
and
if
he
is
no
better
when
he
arrives
he
will
telegraph
for
me
to
go
to
him
he
is
unwilling
for
me
to
go
if
it
can
be
prevented
as
it
is
so
warm
down
there
at
this
time
of
year
besides
i
am
unwilling
to
leave
ruby
and
i
could
not
run
the
risk
of
taking
her
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
wept
a
few
genuine
tears
little
golden
watching
her
with
dry
eyes
and
pale
mute
lips
wondered
if
the
sister
heart
ached
half
so
heavily
and
painfully
as
her
own
did
yet
why
should
i
grieve
for
him
the
poor
child
asked
herself
i
should
rather
rejoice
he
has
forsaken
and
deserted
me
she
could
find
no
answer
to
that
question
in
her
heart
save
that
she
loved
him
loved
him
in
despite
of
her
cruel
wrongs
before
night
another
telegram
was
received
saying
that
bertram
chesleigh
had
asked
repeatedly
for
his
sister
so
it
was
decided
that
desmond
should
accompany
her
husband
mary
do
you
think
that
you
and
the
housekeeper
can
take
care
of
my
little
ruby
while
i
am
gone
inquired
desmond
tearfully
golden
promised
so
earnestly
to
give
her
whole
care
and
attention
to
the
little
one
that
desmond
could
not
help
confiding
in
her
promise
the
child
herself
though
with
grief
at
the
parting
with
her
parents
promised
bravely
to
be
a
good
and
patient
girl
for
uncle
bertie
sake
celine
was
to
accompany
her
mistress
and
was
in
a
bustle
of
pleasant
preparation
the
hours
passed
swiftly
and
the
time
for
the
farewells
soon
came
and
passed
little
ruby
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
dismally
with
her
arms
around
golden
neck
unconscious
that
the
girl
shed
sadder
tears
than
her
own
when
her
little
charge
was
peacefully
dreaming
chapter
xxiii
the
slow
sad
hours
that
bring
us
all
things
ill
waned
slowly
while
golden
and
ruby
waited
impatiently
for
news
of
the
travelers
ruby
was
very
restless
and
capricious
besides
her
daily
headaches
grew
worse
as
the
heat
of
the
summer
season
advanced
she
fretted
very
much
over
her
postponed
trip
to
the
seaside
at
length
a
telegram
came
from
the
travelers
to
say
that
they
had
reached
glenalvan
hall
and
chesleigh
was
no
better
after
this
these
bulletins
came
almost
daily
but
with
no
encouraging
words
very
ill
and
no
prospect
of
improvement
yet
was
their
daily
burden
in
about
two
weeks
desmond
returned
unexpectedly
ruby
was
overjoyed
she
laughed
and
wept
together
as
she
hung
around
his
neck
uncle
bertie
must
be
better
or
you
would
not
have
returned
she
cried
but
her
father
shook
his
head
gravely
no
dear
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
is
not
improving
at
all
indeed
the
case
is
so
critical
that
it
may
be
weeks
before
your
mother
can
return
that
is
why
i
have
come
shall
you
go
back
then
inquired
ruby
yes
in
about
a
week
have
you
fretted
for
us
very
much
ruby
a
great
deal
she
replied
oh
papa
clapping
her
little
hands
now
i
know
why
you
have
come
back
you
are
going
to
take
me
to
mamma
and
uncle
bert
nothing
is
further
from
my
intentions
replied
desmond
i
have
come
to
take
you
to
the
seashore
the
seashore
while
my
uncle
is
so
ill
cried
the
child
a
little
surprised
yes
ruby
you
must
remember
your
own
health
is
very
frail
your
mother
is
very
anxious
about
you
you
will
go
to
the
seashore
in
the
care
of
markham
will
that
arrangement
please
you
very
much
smiled
ruby
i
love
markham
of
course
i
shall
take
my
nurse
yes
of
course
he
replied
then
inquired
carelessly
are
you
still
satisfied
with
mary
smith
oh
yes
mary
is
a
splendid
girl
i
do
not
intend
ever
to
part
from
her
replied
the
child
enthusiastically
i
am
quite
getting
over
my
sulky
spells
since
she
came
mary
does
not
tease
and
cross
me
as
the
others
did
golden
who
had
sat
sewing
quietly
by
the
window
without
ever
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
work
since
desmond
entered
crimsoned
painfully
at
thus
having
his
attention
drawn
upon
her
but
he
took
no
notice
of
her
except
to
say
patronizingly
i
am
glad
you
have
found
such
a
treasure
ruby
i
hope
she
will
remain
with
you
are
you
willing
to
accompany
ruby
to
the
seaside
mary
yes
sir
she
answered
quietly
very
well
i
will
go
and
see
markham
now
if
she
can
go
by
the
last
of
the
week
i
will
accompany
the
party
and
see
you
all
safely
settled
before
i
return
south
golden
made
him
no
answer
thinking
that
none
was
necessary
and
he
went
out
to
call
on
markham
it
was
all
carried
out
as
desmond
wished
in
the
latter
part
of
the
week
he
accompanied
the
party
to
the
seashore
saw
them
installed
in
comfortable
quarters
and
after
staying
two
days
took
leave
again
during
his
short
stay
he
enjoyed
himself
according
to
his
flirting
tastes
with
the
lively
seaside
belles
in
her
capacity
of
ruby
nurse
golden
was
compelled
to
see
him
a
great
deal
but
he
treated
her
at
all
times
with
such
subdued
respect
and
delicate
attention
that
the
girl
grew
less
afraid
of
him
and
began
to
think
that
celine
was
right
when
she
said
he
would
abandon
his
pursuit
of
her
now
that
he
had
found
out
she
was
an
honest
girl
she
did
not
know
that
desmond
quiet
respect
and
delicate
courtesy
was
more
dangerous
than
his
former
open
advances
had
been
still
she
was
relieved
when
he
was
gone
and
she
was
left
alone
with
little
ruby
and
markham
who
was
very
kind
to
the
lonely
girl
though
in
a
decidedly
patronizing
fashion
when
golden
and
ruby
had
been
at
the
seaside
a
month
with
markham
the
glad
tidings
that
chesleigh
was
beginning
to
improve
were
conveyed
to
little
ruby
in
a
short
but
affectionate
letter
from
her
mother
your
dear
uncle
has
had
a
great
fight
for
his
life
but
the
doctor
now
says
that
he
is
likely
to
get
well
desmond
wrote
if
he
continues
to
improve
we
shall
be
able
to
start
home
with
him
in
about
two
weeks
journeying
slowly
we
will
join
you
then
at
the
seaside
as
the
physician
thinks
that
a
month
by
the
sea
will
quite
restore
bertram
health
it
was
golden
task
to
read
this
letter
to
the
little
whose
education
owing
to
her
extreme
frailty
of
constitution
had
not
yet
commenced
the
child
cried
out
noisily
for
joy
at
the
welcome
news
but
golden
said
not
a
word
yet
her
thoughts
were
very
busy
i
shall
see
him
again
very
soon
she
said
to
herself
will
he
recognize
in
his
sister
servant
the
girl
that
loved
him
so
dearly
then
the
thought
came
to
her
that
he
would
not
wish
to
see
her
again
she
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
his
life
henceforth
by
his
own
desire
musing
sadly
by
the
great
moaning
sea
while
little
ruby
gathered
the
shells
along
the
sands
she
murmured
to
herself
those
sweet
pathetic
lines
of
owen
meredith
oh
being
of
beauty
and
bliss
seen
and
known
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
and
possessed
there
alone
my
days
know
thee
not
and
my
lips
name
thee
never
thy
place
in
my
poor
life
is
vacant
forever
we
have
met
we
have
parted
no
name
is
recorded
in
my
annals
on
earth
chapter
xxiv
in
few
more
days
markham
received
a
letter
from
desmond
her
brother
was
so
much
better
that
she
had
quite
recovered
the
tone
of
her
spirits
and
wrote
cheerfully
if
nothing
more
happens
i
shall
be
with
you
the
first
of
september
bertram
will
be
with
me
and
i
shall
also
bring
a
very
charming
young
lady
whom
i
have
invited
to
spend
the
winter
months
with
me
in
new
york
she
is
the
daughter
of
our
host
and
has
been
unwearied
attendant
throughout
his
illness
between
you
and
me
dear
friend
she
is
so
desperately
in
love
with
my
brother
that
she
has
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
anyone
else
she
has
a
younger
sister
whom
i
have
not
invited
i
do
not
like
her
she
is
the
most
abominable
flirt
i
ever
saw
and
has
done
nothing
but
make
eyes
at
desmond
since
we
came
to
glenalvan
hall
glenalvan
hall
mused
markham
holding
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
drawing
her
eyebrows
thoughtfully
together
how
familiar
the
word
sounds
where
have
i
heard
it
she
puzzled
over
it
awhile
then
gave
it
up
in
the
gay
whirl
of
fashionable
society
she
had
forgotten
the
pretty
name
of
the
poor
girl
she
had
befriended
but
she
carried
her
letter
into
ruby
room
and
read
it
aloud
to
her
and
golden
cheeks
that
had
grown
very
pale
and
delicate
of
late
grew
paler
still
elinor
is
coming
she
said
to
herself
in
dismay
what
shall
i
do
she
thought
at
first
that
she
would
go
away
quietly
before
they
came
she
could
not
stay
and
face
her
proud
cousin
elinor
and
the
man
who
had
loved
her
and
then
despised
her
for
the
stain
upon
her
but
the
thought
came
into
her
mind
where
would
she
go
she
had
never
received
any
of
her
wages
from
desmond
yet
if
she
went
away
she
would
be
utterly
friendless
and
penniless
she
clung
to
little
ruby
because
the
child
loved
her
very
dearly
and
without
her
love
she
was
utterly
alone
and
underlying
all
was
a
fierce
passionate
longing
she
could
not
still
to
see
bertram
chesleigh
face
once
more
to
hear
again
that
musical
luring
voice
whose
accents
she
had
hung
upon
so
fondly
a
few
days
before
the
first
of
september
she
turned
timidly
to
markham
who
was
amusing
herself
with
little
ruby
down
on
the
sands
markham
she
said
will
you
tell
me
this
please
are
not
green
glasses
good
for
weak
eyes
i
have
heard
so
replied
the
lady
are
your
eyes
weak
mary
she
looked
into
the
girl
face
as
she
spoke
and
saw
that
the
sweet
blue
eyes
were
dull
and
heavy
how
was
she
to
guess
that
sleepless
nights
and
bitter
tears
had
dimmed
their
sapphire
sparkle
are
your
eyes
weak
mary
she
repeated
seeing
that
the
girl
hesitated
a
blush
tinged
the
pearly
cheek
and
golden
glanced
out
at
the
waves
rolling
in
toward
the
shore
i
think
that
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
sands
and
on
the
water
is
very
weakening
to
the
sight
she
replied
evasively
so
it
is
i
have
heard
others
complain
of
the
same
thing
if
the
light
affects
your
eyes
i
would
advise
you
by
all
means
to
wear
the
glasses
thank
you
i
believe
i
will
try
a
pair
returned
golden
oh
mary
you
will
be
a
perfect
fright
if
you
do
cried
out
little
ruby
in
childish
disapproval
you
have
covered
up
all
your
long
gold
hair
under
that
ugly
cap
and
now
if
you
cover
up
your
pretty
blue
eyes
you
will
be
as
as
as
i
do
know
what
never
mind
the
looks
my
dear
said
markham
in
her
gentle
way
if
mary
is
kind
and
loving
at
heart
her
looks
will
not
signify
but
i
do
so
love
pretty
things
said
the
child
and
i
love
to
look
at
mary
she
looks
like
a
picture
at
night
when
she
combs
out
her
shining
hair
over
her
shoulders
there
is
not
a
lady
at
the
seaside
this
summer
as
pretty
as
my
nurse
fie
my
dear
you
must
not
make
mary
vain
cried
the
lady
half
smiling
i
want
to
ask
you
a
favor
markham
said
golden
blushing
very
much
a
favor
what
is
it
mary
asked
markham
encouragingly
golden
glanced
down
at
her
blue
cashmere
dress
which
had
grown
very
shabby
and
worn
during
the
two
months
she
had
been
in
little
service
you
see
i
had
lost
all
my
money
when
i
went
into
service
she
said
falteringly
and
i
have
not
received
any
of
my
wages
yet
and
and
i
am
getting
too
shabby
to
be
that
was
little
golden
plea
but
the
truth
was
that
she
did
not
wish
her
cousin
elinor
and
bertram
chesleigh
to
recognize
her
and
so
wished
to
lay
aside
the
blue
cashmere
which
had
been
her
best
dress
at
glenalvan
hall
oh
you
poor
child
burst
out
markham
why
did
you
never
tell
me
that
before
i
see
now
you
want
me
to
lend
you
the
money
to
buy
a
new
dress
if
you
will
be
so
very
very
kind
faltered
golden
gratefully
i
will
do
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
answered
markham
whose
purse
was
ever
open
to
the
needy
and
distressed
so
on
the
first
of
september
little
golden
appeared
in
quite
an
altered
guise
the
pretty
blue
cashmere
that
was
so
becoming
to
her
complexion
was
laid
aside
and
she
wore
a
sober
dress
so
long
and
plain
that
she
looked
a
great
deal
taller
and
older
she
had
pinned
a
dark
silk
handkerchief
high
up
around
her
white
throat
thus
concealing
its
fairness
and
graceful
contour
she
had
fashioned
herself
a
huge
abominable
cap
that
hid
every
wave
of
her
golden
hair
spectacles
were
fastened
before
the
bright
blue
eyes
and
with
her
long
tucked
white
apron
little
golden
made
the
that
could
have
been
imagined
she
looked
in
the
mirror
and
decided
that
no
one
who
had
known
her
at
glenalvan
hall
would
recognize
her
now
but
little
ruby
exclaimed
dolorously
at
her
strange
appearance
oh
mary
you
have
made
yourself
quite
ugly
she
cried
and
i
had
been
thinking
how
i
would
show
uncle
bert
my
pretty
nurse
oh
ruby
you
must
not
cried
golden
in
terror
promise
me
you
will
not
will
not
what
asked
the
little
one
surprised
will
not
show
me
to
chesleigh
nor
tell
him
that
you
think
i
am
pretty
said
golden
in
alarm
very
well
i
wo
said
the
little
one
disappointed
but
i
am
very
sorry
for
i
am
sure
uncle
bertie
would
be
glad
to
know
that
i
have
a
good
and
pretty
nurse
he
used
to
laugh
at
the
ugly
ones
and
he
said
their
faces
were
so
horrid
it
was
not
strange
they
were
bad
tempered
there
is
another
thing
i
want
you
to
promise
me
please
darling
said
golden
who
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
her
little
charge
what
is
it
mary
inquired
the
child
when
your
uncle
comes
to
sit
and
talk
with
you
ruby
you
must
let
me
run
away
and
stay
until
he
leaves
you
why
should
you
do
that
asked
ruby
i
have
some
sewing
to
do
replied
golden
evasively
i
know
but
you
always
do
your
sewing
with
me
said
ruby
you
see
it
would
be
quite
different
with
a
man
in
the
way
uncle
bert
would
not
bother
you
one
bit
i
can
not
see
why
you
are
afraid
of
him
rejoined
the
child
but
i
do
not
like
men
ruby
i
do
not
like
to
be
where
a
man
is
now
dear
will
you
excuse
me
pleaded
golden
yes
i
will
since
you
insist
on
it
answered
ruby
but
i
ca
see
what
makes
you
hate
men
now
i
like
them
i
like
papa
i
like
uncle
bert
and
i
shall
like
my
husband
when
i
grow
big
enough
to
have
one
do
you
ever
intend
to
have
a
husband
mary
said
the
child
with
a
child
thoughtlessness
chapter
xxv
the
beautiful
color
surged
hotly
into
golden
cheeks
at
ruby
artless
question
she
turned
her
head
away
to
hide
the
pain
that
made
her
sweet
lips
quiver
mary
do
you
ever
intend
to
have
a
husband
repeated
the
child
hush
ruby
you
are
too
young
to
talk
about
husbands
answered
golden
dear
me
is
my
daughter
contemplating
marriage
cried
a
gay
sweet
voice
and
looking
up
they
saw
desmond
in
her
traveling
wraps
dusty
and
weary
but
looking
very
glad
and
eager
at
seeing
her
child
again
ruby
sprang
to
her
arms
and
golden
looked
on
with
sympathetic
tears
in
her
eyes
at
the
happy
reunion
of
the
mother
and
child
desmond
did
not
seem
to
see
her
until
she
had
fairly
smothered
ruby
in
kisses
when
she
looked
up
and
said
approvingly
how
do
you
do
mary
that
is
a
very
nice
new
dress
quite
suitable
to
you
after
a
minute
she
said
suddenly
as
if
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
her
by
the
way
you
have
never
yet
received
any
of
your
wages
from
me
here
are
twenty
dollars
for
two
months
i
am
very
glad
you
have
taken
such
good
care
of
ruby
golden
thanked
her
and
took
the
money
but
the
gold
seemed
to
burn
the
delicate
palm
it
was
hard
to
be
receiving
a
servant
wages
from
bertram
chesleigh
sister
where
is
papa
and
uncle
bert
asked
ruby
papa
will
be
here
directly
bert
is
very
tired
he
has
gone
to
his
room
to
rest
you
must
not
go
to
him
yet
and
the
young
lady
mamma
she
came
oh
yes
is
she
pretty
mamma
has
she
blue
eyes
or
black
she
is
decidedly
handsome
and
her
eyes
are
black
do
you
like
her
mamma
quite
well
dear
she
is
very
charming
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
perhaps
she
will
be
your
auntie
some
day
is
she
going
to
marry
uncle
bert
inquired
ruby
nothing
is
settled
yet
dear
but
it
seems
probable
bert
could
not
find
a
more
brilliant
mrs
chesleigh
i
do
not
wish
for
uncle
bert
to
marry
i
shall
tell
him
so
cried
ruby
fie
little
selfishness
you
will
do
no
such
thing
he
ought
to
marry
and
settle
down
at
home
we
should
not
then
have
to
be
running
after
him
in
every
place
where
he
chooses
to
fall
sick
here
i
have
been
by
his
all
summer
ruining
my
health
and
missing
the
whole
season
by
the
sea
how
gladly
i
would
have
exchanged
places
with
you
moaned
little
golden
to
herself
mamma
did
you
like
glenalvan
hall
inquired
ruby
oh
very
much
though
it
is
little
better
than
a
ruin
it
must
have
been
quite
a
grand
place
once
it
is
beautiful
still
in
its
decay
the
owners
were
ruined
by
the
late
war
oh
how
anxiously
beautiful
golden
longed
to
hear
one
word
from
her
old
grandfather
and
her
black
mammy
she
listened
with
a
beating
heart
to
the
lady
words
but
she
never
named
the
two
that
little
golden
loved
so
dearly
and
after
awhile
she
rose
and
said
that
celine
was
waiting
for
her
and
she
must
go
little
ruby
clung
to
her
dress
may
i
go
she
pleaded
and
desmond
yielding
a
smiling
assent
they
went
away
together
and
left
golden
alone
in
the
room
alone
with
her
young
heart
full
of
strange
troubled
joy
bertram
chesleigh
was
here
under
the
same
roof
with
her
she
should
see
him
she
should
hear
him
once
again
there
was
a
bitter
troubled
pleasure
in
the
thought
she
could
not
bear
the
tumult
of
oppressive
thoughts
that
rushed
over
her
mind
to
escape
them
she
went
in
quest
of
markham
and
paid
her
the
money
she
had
borrowed
from
her
a
few
days
before
then
she
went
back
to
the
room
to
wait
for
little
ruby
but
the
child
was
so
preoccupied
with
her
friends
that
she
did
not
return
to
her
room
during
the
day
at
twilight
she
came
flitting
in
joyously
as
a
little
fairy
oh
mary
i
have
had
such
a
charming
day
and
you
must
dress
me
now
in
my
white
lace
dress
over
the
pink
satin
slip
and
my
white
satin
slippers
and
embroidered
stockings
i
am
going
to
stay
up
for
the
ball
wo
that
be
splendid
golden
looked
a
little
anxiously
at
the
moist
flushed
face
and
shining
dark
eyes
darling
let
me
persuade
you
to
lie
down
on
the
sofa
and
rest
awhile
she
urged
you
have
had
such
a
busy
exciting
day
that
you
need
rest
you
will
have
one
of
your
bad
headaches
oh
no
i
am
not
tired
one
bit
and
mamma
and
miss
glenalvan
are
gone
to
dress
now
i
must
be
ready
when
they
call
for
me
urged
ruby
i
suppose
miss
glenalvan
is
very
pretty
is
she
not
ruby
said
golden
as
she
combed
and
brushed
the
little
girl
long
shining
black
ringlets
oh
yes
she
is
very
pretty
she
has
large
black
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
splendid
hair
but
she
is
not
beautiful
like
you
mary
was
the
prompt
reply
you
must
not
let
miss
glenalvan
hear
you
say
that
said
golden
she
would
be
displeased
hump
said
ruby
carelessly
then
she
flew
to
another
subject
while
golden
trembled
nervously
uncle
bert
is
looking
wretchedly
ouch
mary
what
make
you
jerk
that
curl
so
his
eyes
are
as
big
as
saucers
are
you
almost
done
you
pull
my
hair
dreadfully
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
marry
miss
glenalvan
he
said
that
was
a
silly
question
mary
what
has
come
over
you
you
were
never
so
rough
with
my
head
before
there
it
is
finished
now
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
excuse
me
dear
faltered
golden
as
she
laid
out
the
white
lace
dress
and
satin
slippers
for
the
eager
child
all
right
i
am
not
angry
said
ruby
i
told
uncle
bert
what
a
kind
girl
you
were
and
he
was
delighted
to
hear
it
i
wanted
to
tell
him
you
were
pretty
too
but
i
did
as
you
did
want
him
to
know
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
mary
if
he
ever
sees
you
he
will
find
out
for
himself
what
in
this
great
cap
and
glasses
cried
golden
alarmed
yes
indeed
you
ca
hide
your
round
cheeks
and
your
red
mouth
and
your
dimpled
chin
cried
the
child
in
pretty
triumph
i
can
keep
out
of
chesleigh
way
anyhow
golden
replied
as
she
buttoned
the
pretty
dress
and
clasped
a
slight
gold
chain
around
the
white
neck
of
the
child
now
you
are
quite
finished
she
said
you
look
very
sweet
and
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
very
much
thank
you
said
the
little
girl
impulsively
kissing
her
then
she
added
a
little
pityingly
it
is
a
pity
can
not
be
dressed
in
white
and
go
to
the
ball
too
mary
do
you
never
wish
to
sometimes
admitted
golden
with
her
sweet
frankness
and
a
soft
little
sigh
ruby
studied
her
attentively
a
moment
her
dark
head
perched
daintily
like
a
bird
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
a
she
said
it
should
be
a
white
lace
over
blue
satin
and
looped
with
violets
you
should
have
large
white
pearls
around
your
neck
and
your
hair
hanging
down
and
a
of
pearls
to
bind
it
it
is
a
great
pity
you
are
not
rich
mary
people
say
that
you
are
too
pretty
to
be
a
servant
something
like
a
sob
rose
in
golden
throat
and
was
hardly
repressed
they
had
told
her
this
so
often
she
was
beautiful
but
it
had
only
brought
her
sorrow
to
her
as
her
mother
had
been
given
the
fatal
gift
of
beauty
which
became
a
funeral
dower
of
present
woes
and
past
i
am
very
sorry
i
am
so
pretty
ruby
she
said
sorrowfully
and
the
child
answered
quickly
i
would
not
be
sorry
if
i
were
you
mary
some
good
man
will
fall
in
love
with
your
pretty
face
some
day
and
marry
you
golden
made
no
reply
to
this
solace
for
the
door
opened
to
admit
desmond
followed
by
her
young
lady
guest
golden
retreated
shyly
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
she
was
face
to
face
at
last
with
her
haughty
cousin
elinor
she
drooped
her
head
a
moment
sadly
while
a
flood
of
memories
rushed
over
her
then
bravely
lifted
it
again
and
looked
at
the
young
lady
through
her
disfiguring
green
glasses
elinor
glenalvan
only
glanced
with
careless
indifference
at
the
figure
of
the
nurse
then
her
large
black
eyes
turned
away
again
so
that
golden
had
time
to
observe
her
with
impunity
the
glenalvans
had
exerted
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
secure
an
outfit
for
elinor
the
result
did
credit
to
their
efforts
the
girl
was
certainly
dazzling
she
wore
trimmed
with
rich
spanish
lace
and
cardinal
satin
great
clusters
of
jaqueminot
roses
burned
on
her
bosom
and
in
her
shining
raven
hair
the
costly
pearl
necklace
that
john
glenalvan
had
taken
from
golden
was
clasped
around
her
white
throat
a
throb
of
resentment
stirred
the
young
girl
breast
as
she
observed
it
desmond
wore
white
lace
looped
with
diminutive
and
sunflowers
her
jewels
were
diamonds
and
she
was
as
usual
brilliantly
beautiful
and
graceful
golden
caught
her
breath
in
awed
admiration
of
the
two
beautiful
women
are
you
ready
ruby
inquired
desmond
yes
mamma
said
the
child
blithely
all
three
went
out
then
and
golden
threw
a
dark
shawl
over
her
head
and
went
out
upon
the
seashore
it
was
a
moonlight
night
calm
and
still
with
that
slight
chill
in
the
air
that
comes
with
september
she
sat
down
a
quiet
forlorn
little
figure
on
the
lonely
sands
and
watched
the
great
waves
rolling
in
to
her
feet
something
in
the
immensity
and
solemnity
of
the
great
ocean
seemed
to
calm
the
turbulence
of
the
fevered
young
heart
and
whisper
a
gentle
peace
be
still
to
the
passions
that
racked
her
wronged
and
outraged
spirit
chapter
xxvi
as
golden
had
feared
little
ruby
day
and
night
of
excitement
proved
too
much
for
her
she
was
unable
to
rise
from
her
bed
the
next
morning
being
prostrated
by
one
of
her
nervous
headaches
to
add
to
her
damp
rainy
weather
set
in
during
the
night
spoiling
all
the
pleasant
plans
of
the
party
for
the
day
golden
darkened
the
room
lighted
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
carefully
tended
the
little
patient
who
dozed
fitfully
until
when
she
awakened
and
declared
herself
better
has
no
one
been
in
to
see
me
mary
she
inquired
and
golden
answered
yes
your
mamma
came
to
the
door
while
you
were
sleeping
but
went
away
again
saying
that
she
would
not
disturb
your
rest
you
may
go
and
tell
her
to
come
now
mary
i
think
she
is
with
your
uncle
just
now
dear
can
not
you
wait
a
little
while
said
golden
she
said
she
would
go
to
him
a
little
while
as
you
were
asleep
no
i
can
not
wait
replied
ruby
fretfully
tell
mamma
to
bring
uncle
bert
with
her
if
you
have
too
much
company
your
head
will
ache
again
ruby
no
it
will
not
it
is
ever
so
much
better
why
do
you
do
as
i
ask
you
mary
cried
the
spoiled
child
golden
went
out
without
any
further
objection
she
asked
celine
whom
she
met
in
the
hall
to
deliver
ruby
message
to
her
mother
and
her
uncle
celine
looked
into
the
a
minute
later
to
say
that
they
were
engaged
just
at
present
but
would
come
in
about
fifteen
minutes
oh
dear
fretted
the
ailing
little
one
that
is
a
long
time
to
wait
give
me
my
dolls
mary
i
try
to
amuse
myself
with
them
golden
brought
the
miscellaneous
family
of
dolls
and
ranged
them
around
ruby
on
the
bed
chatting
pleasantly
to
her
the
while
in
the
hope
of
lessening
the
weariness
of
waiting
you
must
keep
your
promise
and
let
me
go
out
when
they
come
she
said
presently
feeling
that
she
was
growing
so
nervous
she
could
not
possibly
remain
in
the
same
room
with
bertram
chesleigh
very
well
you
may
go
into
the
next
room
replied
the
child
you
may
leave
the
door
just
a
little
ajar
that
i
may
call
you
when
i
want
you
i
hope
you
will
not
want
me
until
they
are
gone
out
again
replied
golden
when
the
expected
rap
came
on
the
door
the
girl
opened
it
with
a
trembling
hand
she
did
not
look
up
as
desmond
and
her
brother
entered
but
softly
closing
the
door
after
them
glided
precipitately
from
the
room
bertram
chesleigh
saw
the
little
retreating
figure
in
the
huge
cap
and
gray
gown
and
laughed
as
he
kissed
his
little
niece
i
suppose
that
was
mary
smith
the
prodigy
he
said
yes
and
you
must
not
laugh
at
her
said
ruby
a
little
resentfully
she
is
very
good
and
sweet
and
i
love
her
dearly
there
was
an
element
of
teasing
in
bertram
chesleigh
nature
and
ruby
words
roused
it
into
activity
she
looked
very
prim
and
starched
he
observed
she
must
be
an
old
maid
is
she
not
ruby
he
expected
that
the
little
girl
would
grow
indignant
at
this
comment
on
her
favorite
but
instead
of
this
she
puckered
her
little
brows
thoughtfully
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
by
an
old
maid
she
replied
you
are
caught
in
the
trap
bert
you
will
have
to
define
yourself
said
desmond
laughingly
i
do
know
whether
i
can
he
replied
as
gayly
but
i
think
ruby
that
an
old
maid
is
a
person
who
who
does
like
men
and
grows
old
and
never
marries
then
my
nurse
is
an
old
maid
you
guessed
right
uncle
bert
said
the
child
with
perfect
soberness
why
do
you
think
so
my
dear
inquired
her
mother
very
much
amused
at
the
child
notion
because
i
know
it
mamma
mary
smith
hates
men
she
told
me
she
did
she
does
not
like
to
be
where
men
are
that
is
why
she
went
out
just
now
she
says
she
will
always
stay
out
of
the
room
when
uncle
bert
is
with
me
that
is
very
sensible
indeed
in
mary
said
desmond
with
decided
approval
while
bertram
chesleigh
only
laughed
and
said
that
men
were
not
ogres
and
he
would
not
have
eaten
miss
smith
even
if
she
had
remained
in
the
room
meanwhile
golden
had
retreated
to
the
leaving
the
door
ajar
as
ruby
had
bidden
her
every
word
of
the
conversation
which
had
so
strangely
turned
upon
herself
was
distinctly
audible
she
listened
in
fear
and
trembling
to
ruby
disclosures
regarding
her
antipathy
to
men
dreading
to
hear
some
further
revelation
that
would
draw
suspicion
upon
her
but
the
child
had
no
idea
of
imparting
anything
she
had
promised
to
keep
a
secret
and
the
conversation
gradually
turned
upon
indifferent
subjects
so
that
golden
whose
heart
was
beating
wildly
at
the
sound
of
her
lover
voice
ventured
at
last
on
a
sly
peep
at
him
through
the
open
door
the
breath
came
thick
and
fast
over
the
sweet
parted
lips
as
she
gazed
hardly
as
he
had
used
her
the
ineffable
love
and
pity
of
a
woman
heart
came
up
to
the
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
shone
out
upon
the
unconscious
ingrate
who
dreamed
not
whose
eyes
were
yearning
over
him
with
all
the
pain
and
pathos
of
a
loving
yet
outraged
heart
oh
how
pale
and
ill
he
looks
cried
the
poor
child
to
herself
he
looks
sad
and
altered
too
he
has
suffered
almost
as
much
as
i
have
was
it
that
which
made
him
ill
i
wonder
after
all
he
loved
me
dearly
but
if
he
had
overlooked
the
shame
of
my
birth
and
brought
me
here
his
sister
would
have
scorned
me
ought
i
to
blame
him
so
very
very
much
as
she
asked
herself
the
piteous
question
the
memory
of
some
words
rose
into
her
mind
solemn
words
not
to
be
lightly
forgotten
will
you
forsaking
all
others
cleave
only
unto
her
so
long
as
ye
both
shall
live
by
the
light
of
those
words
golden
answered
her
own
question
with
a
tearless
sob
she
turned
her
eyes
away
from
the
too
dear
face
of
the
false
one
but
though
she
would
not
look
at
him
she
could
not
help
hearing
his
voice
as
he
answered
little
ruby
voluble
chatter
presently
the
child
showed
him
her
great
wax
doll
and
when
he
had
admired
it
sufficiently
to
please
her
she
said
with
an
air
of
mystery
you
could
not
guess
dollie
name
if
you
tried
all
day
uncle
bertie
it
is
something
no
doubt
he
laughed
it
is
queen
victoria
or
princess
louise
or
something
like
that
you
are
quite
wrong
she
replied
with
sparkling
eyes
am
i
well
i
have
it
now
you
have
called
her
mary
smith
after
your
nurse
no
i
have
not
said
the
little
one
merrily
i
have
called
her
golden
golden
chesleigh
in
the
next
breath
she
added
quickly
oh
uncle
bert
what
made
you
start
just
as
if
someone
had
shot
you
did
i
start
he
inquired
it
must
have
been
because
i
am
very
nervous
since
my
illness
well
and
what
did
you
say
your
elegant
doll
was
named
did
you
not
understand
me
before
it
is
golden
chesleigh
chesleigh
after
you
uncle
bert
is
it
not
a
pretty
name
very
he
rejoined
pale
to
the
lips
did
you
think
of
it
yourself
ruby
not
at
all
i
asked
mary
for
a
name
and
she
said
golden
then
i
added
chesleigh
some
curiosity
came
over
him
to
see
the
good
nurse
who
loved
ruby
and
was
kind
to
her
but
who
hated
men
and
who
had
chosen
for
the
pretty
wax
doll
the
sweet
and
unusual
name
of
golden
there
came
a
light
tap
on
the
outer
door
desmond
rose
to
open
it
golden
peeped
again
and
saw
her
cousin
elinor
coming
in
may
i
come
in
and
see
the
invalid
she
asked
brightly
and
bertram
chesleigh
answered
yes
do
miss
glenalvan
ruby
is
better
and
is
holding
a
levee
of
her
humble
subjects
elinor
kissed
the
child
and
sat
down
as
near
as
she
dared
to
chesleigh
she
looked
very
bright
and
blooming
and
her
dress
was
as
usual
fashionable
and
becoming
golden
could
see
that
desmond
regarded
her
with
a
real
fondness
elinor
had
found
out
the
lady
weakness
and
played
upon
it
skillfully
she
saw
that
she
was
jealous
of
her
husband
and
immediately
affected
an
indifference
to
and
an
utter
obliviousness
of
the
fascinations
of
the
handsome
desmond
that
delighted
his
wife
and
drew
her
heart
to
elinor
clare
on
the
contrary
had
an
uncontrollable
propensity
for
flirting
and
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
witnessing
the
grand
lady
silent
rage
at
her
walks
and
talks
and
careless
enjoyment
of
her
flippant
husband
society
the
result
was
that
elinor
received
a
charmingly
worded
invitation
to
return
to
the
north
with
desmond
while
clare
was
silently
and
chillingly
ignored
she
was
bitterly
angry
at
missing
the
trip
and
sorely
repented
her
weakness
but
too
late
for
the
repentance
to
avail
while
elinor
was
transported
with
delight
surely
she
thought
a
whole
winter
in
new
york
with
beautiful
golden
out
of
the
way
would
be
sufficient
for
the
accomplishment
of
her
designs
upon
bertram
chesleigh
heart
sweet
golden
read
her
cousin
purpose
plainly
in
the
tender
glances
she
gave
chesleigh
now
and
then
from
beneath
her
lashes
and
the
heart
of
the
innocent
girl
sank
heavily
she
will
win
him
from
me
she
said
drearily
to
herself
elinor
is
so
beautiful
and
graceful
and
brilliant
it
is
a
wonder
that
he
ever
liked
me
better
than
he
did
her
it
was
but
a
light
fancy
after
all
perhaps
he
will
forget
it
and
turn
to
her
the
thought
gave
her
inexpressible
pain
she
sank
upon
the
floor
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
weeping
silent
and
bitter
tears
while
the
hum
of
gay
talk
and
laughter
flowed
on
unheeded
in
the
next
room
so
it
is
ever
in
the
busy
jostling
world
sorrow
and
joy
go
side
by
side
the
bridal
train
meets
the
funeral
procession
life
is
mingled
sunshine
and
shadow
ah
if
bertram
chesleigh
could
only
have
known
what
true
and
faithful
little
heart
was
breaking
so
near
him
after
awhile
the
brightness
died
from
ruby
eyes
the
little
face
looked
tired
and
wan
she
said
almost
petulantly
now
i
shall
send
you
all
away
miss
glenalvan
laughs
so
much
she
makes
my
head
ache
fie
my
darling
cried
her
mother
it
is
the
truth
mamma
cried
the
willful
little
girl
i
want
you
all
to
go
now
and
mary
shall
bathe
my
head
until
i
get
better
who
is
mary
i
feel
quite
jealous
of
her
said
elinor
sweetly
but
inwardly
raging
at
the
spoiled
child
whims
as
she
termed
them
to
herself
mary
is
my
nurse
said
the
child
and
her
uncle
laughingly
added
a
person
with
antipathy
to
me
miss
glenalvan
you
should
cultivate
her
she
must
be
a
do
you
suppose
that
all
women
admire
your
sex
sir
retorted
the
young
lady
spiritedly
and
they
left
the
room
exchanging
lively
while
desmond
looked
inside
the
other
door
for
golden
she
saw
her
sitting
quietly
her
sweet
face
bent
over
some
sewing
no
trace
apparent
of
the
heartache
she
was
silently
enduring
mary
you
may
come
to
your
charge
now
she
said
with
so
much
more
than
her
usual
kindness
of
tone
that
golden
delicate
lip
quivered
desmond
had
been
pleased
to
hear
that
ruby
beautiful
nurse
disliked
men
and
was
not
willing
to
remain
in
the
room
with
one
she
laid
aside
her
sewing
and
went
in
to
ruby
desmond
bent
to
kiss
her
pet
and
said
fondly
shall
i
stay
and
bathe
your
head
love
no
mamma
i
would
rather
have
mary
she
replied
i
shall
be
jealous
of
mary
you
are
so
fond
of
her
the
mother
rejoined
as
she
left
the
room
golden
put
the
dolls
away
and
bathed
the
brow
of
the
little
sufferer
until
she
fell
into
a
deep
and
quiet
sleep
then
she
sat
near
the
window
and
watched
the
gloomy
september
rain
pattering
drearily
down
and
the
white
mist
rising
from
the
sea
the
door
opened
and
celine
came
in
softly
and
sat
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
mary
she
said
in
her
low
voice
shall
i
disturb
the
child
not
if
you
talk
softly
replied
golden
hoping
that
celine
would
tell
her
something
about
glenalvan
hall
she
was
not
disappointed
for
the
maid
said
at
once
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
queer
old
black
woman
i
saw
at
that
place
where
chesleigh
was
ill
glenalvan
hall
watching
her
narrowly
golden
started
and
looked
up
eagerly
yes
tell
me
about
her
celine
she
said
with
repressed
excitement
well
to
begin
with
said
celine
she
was
a
most
old
creature
full
of
grumblings
and
complaints
this
old
creature
when
she
found
i
was
from
new
york
came
to
me
secretly
and
asked
me
the
oddest
question
golden
chancing
to
look
up
at
that
moment
met
celine
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
such
a
strange
expression
that
her
heart
gave
a
frightened
bound
it
was
evident
that
the
maid
had
some
suspicions
of
her
she
forced
a
calmness
she
did
not
feel
and
replied
carelessly
the
blacks
you
know
celine
are
very
ignorant
their
questions
appear
quite
ridiculous
sometimes
to
intelligent
and
people
chapter
xxvii
celine
looked
cunningly
at
golden
as
she
made
her
confused
explanation
you
seem
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
negroes
she
said
perhaps
you
have
been
in
the
south
i
have
replied
golden
with
sudden
pretty
defiance
it
was
my
where
glenalvan
hall
asked
celine
thinking
to
catch
her
i
did
not
say
that
replied
golden
coolly
no
well
i
will
tell
you
what
that
old
woman
dinah
she
was
called
asked
me
about
a
young
lady
golden
lifted
her
eyes
and
regarded
her
bravely
well
she
said
she
asked
me
continued
celine
if
i
had
seen
a
young
girl
in
new
york
of
about
sixteen
with
large
blue
eyes
and
long
golden
curls
dressed
in
a
blue
cashmere
dress
and
hat
and
jacket
i
told
her
yes
for
her
description
of
the
lady
appearance
corresponded
exactly
with
yours
golden
remained
perfectly
silent
her
eyes
turned
resolutely
from
celine
she
asked
me
the
maid
continued
if
the
young
girl
had
found
her
mother
golden
could
not
repress
a
sudden
violent
start
aha
cried
celine
quickly
you
see
i
am
acquainted
with
your
whole
history
you
know
nothing
about
me
whatever
celine
replied
golden
warmly
and
i
can
not
see
by
what
right
you
pry
into
my
affairs
oh
well
if
we
are
so
we
can
keep
our
secret
returned
celine
scornfully
but
somebody
will
find
that
it
was
better
to
have
made
a
friend
than
an
enemy
of
celine
duval
with
these
ambiguous
words
celine
bounced
out
of
the
room
leaving
poor
little
golden
terribly
frightened
and
distressed
she
silently
resolved
that
she
would
leave
desmond
the
next
day
proceed
to
new
york
and
make
an
effort
to
find
her
mother
meanwhile
the
irate
maid
had
gone
to
elinor
room
desmond
had
kindly
promised
to
allow
celine
to
superintend
her
toilet
while
they
remained
at
the
seaside
and
she
was
waiting
now
for
the
frenchwoman
to
arrange
her
hair
celine
had
become
possessed
of
golden
secret
and
she
was
determined
to
make
capital
out
of
it
for
herself
elinor
was
quite
chatty
and
confidential
with
the
skillful
french
maid
in
a
very
few
moments
while
she
was
braiding
the
young
lady
hair
she
had
dropped
a
few
artful
hints
and
innuendoes
that
made
elinor
start
up
half
wild
with
fear
and
terror
oh
no
celine
you
must
have
imagined
it
it
is
too
incredible
to
believe
i
do
not
ask
you
to
believe
simple
word
miss
glenalvan
replied
celine
look
at
the
girl
yourself
and
then
you
can
tell
me
if
my
suspicions
are
well
founded
elinor
looked
at
her
blankly
for
a
moment
the
maid
returned
her
gaze
with
unruffled
serenity
only
take
a
good
look
at
her
yourself
miss
she
repeated
how
am
i
to
do
so
without
exciting
her
suspicions
demanded
elinor
easily
enough
replied
the
wily
french
maid
go
back
to
the
room
and
pretend
to
have
lost
some
trifle
get
her
to
go
down
on
her
knees
to
find
it
and
you
can
obtain
a
good
look
into
her
face
elinor
glenalvan
waited
for
no
more
clenching
her
small
hands
vindictively
and
with
an
evil
look
on
her
handsome
face
she
hurried
out
into
the
corridor
and
made
her
way
to
ruby
room
she
turned
the
handle
softly
and
looked
in
the
child
lay
on
the
bed
sleeping
peacefully
and
golden
remained
at
the
window
peering
out
through
the
blind
at
the
dismal
prospect
her
red
lips
quivering
grievously
her
sweet
blue
eyes
dim
with
unshed
tears
she
started
up
nervously
as
her
cousin
came
in
abruptly
and
closed
the
door
elinor
looked
into
her
face
and
her
heart
grave
a
great
frightened
bound
she
recognized
the
beautiful
face
instantly
in
spite
of
the
disfiguring
cap
and
glasses
controlling
her
rage
by
a
violent
effort
she
observed
with
comparative
calmness
i
have
lost
a
gold
mary
and
thought
perhaps
i
had
dropped
it
in
here
have
you
seen
it
golden
answered
her
with
a
shrinking
negative
and
elinor
continued
i
am
almost
certain
that
i
dropped
it
in
this
room
perhaps
it
has
rolled
beneath
the
bed
will
you
get
down
and
look
under
it
mary
golden
complied
without
a
word
and
elinor
had
the
desired
opportunity
of
looking
at
the
girl
face
in
another
moment
half
beside
herself
with
jealous
rage
she
caught
the
cap
and
glasses
from
golden
head
and
face
and
cried
out
in
low
hoarse
accents
of
intense
passion
golden
glenalvan
you
shameless
creature
what
are
you
doing
here
golden
sprang
to
her
feet
and
looked
at
her
heartless
cousin
in
momentary
terrified
silence
what
are
you
doing
here
elinor
repeated
in
a
voice
of
raging
scorn
did
you
wish
to
advertise
your
disgrace
to
bertram
chesleigh
sister
disgrace
faltered
the
poor
child
yes
your
disgrace
it
is
plain
enough
to
be
seen
cried
elinor
pointing
a
scornful
finger
at
her
cousin
who
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
hid
her
blushing
face
in
her
small
hands
did
you
come
here
that
desmond
might
learn
the
full
measure
of
her
brother
sin
golden
looked
up
with
blue
eyes
into
the
blazing
orbs
of
the
angry
girl
elinor
i
did
not
know
she
was
his
sister
until
after
i
came
she
murmured
pleadingly
but
when
you
found
it
out
why
did
you
not
go
away
elinor
demanded
sharply
i
had
nowhere
to
go
i
was
friendless
and
penniless
what
could
i
do
but
stay
moaned
golden
you
should
have
drowned
yourself
you
are
not
fit
to
live
you
wicked
deceitful
girl
so
you
were
chesleigh
mistress
after
all
although
you
swore
that
you
were
pure
and
innocent
blazed
elinor
i
am
innocent
i
was
never
bertram
chesleigh
mistress
golden
cried
i
am
his
own
true
she
stopped
with
a
moan
of
anguish
go
i
must
not
tell
i
must
keep
my
promise
oh
elinor
you
are
my
cousin
do
not
be
so
hard
and
cruel
how
dare
you
claim
me
as
your
cousin
cried
elinor
angrily
get
up
from
the
floor
and
stop
making
a
simpleton
of
yourself
you
have
got
to
go
away
from
here
do
you
understand
me
golden
rose
to
her
feet
and
looked
steadily
into
elinor
face
with
flashing
blue
eyes
a
spirit
was
roused
within
her
that
quite
equaled
her
cousin
elinor
she
answered
i
understand
you
but
let
me
tell
you
here
and
now
that
i
defy
your
commands
you
have
no
authority
over
me
and
i
am
the
mistress
of
my
own
actions
i
shall
remain
in
service
as
long
as
i
choose
to
do
so
your
whole
treatment
of
me
has
been
such
as
to
merit
no
consideration
at
my
hands
and
it
shall
receive
none
if
angry
looks
could
have
killed
little
golden
would
never
have
survived
her
defiant
speech
for
elinor
dark
eyes
glared
upon
her
with
the
deadly
fury
of
an
enraged
tigress
you
will
not
go
she
hissed
perhaps
you
think
to
stay
here
and
resume
your
old
sinful
relations
with
bertram
chesleigh
before
golden
could
reply
to
the
cruel
taunt
there
was
an
interruption
little
ruby
awakened
by
elinor
angry
tones
sprang
upright
in
the
bed
and
cried
out
in
the
utmost
surprise
and
resentment
what
is
the
matter
why
are
you
scolding
my
nurse
miss
glenalvan
elinor
turned
to
ruby
with
an
instantaneous
change
of
manner
why
you
little
darling
she
cried
with
honeyed
sweetness
what
an
absurd
idea
you
must
have
dreamed
it
all
i
was
only
asking
mary
about
a
gold
i
had
dropped
on
the
floor
i
am
very
sorry
i
disturbed
you
in
your
refreshing
sleep
she
left
the
room
before
the
child
could
challenge
her
plausible
excuse
and
returned
to
celine
i
was
right
the
maid
cried
triumphantly
i
see
it
in
your
face
elinor
dropped
into
a
chair
and
the
change
in
her
face
was
quite
striking
enough
to
have
excited
the
woman
exclamation
she
was
as
white
as
death
her
black
eyes
gleamed
with
vindictive
rage
her
thin
lips
were
set
in
a
cruel
line
yes
you
were
right
she
said
in
a
low
intense
voice
celine
that
girl
must
go
away
from
here
did
you
tell
her
so
asked
the
woman
yes
and
helplessly
she
defied
me
oh
what
am
i
to
do
she
would
not
go
for
you
no
she
is
determined
to
stay
but
passionately
she
must
go
and
go
this
very
day
if
she
remains
and
chesleigh
sees
her
all
is
lost
he
will
recognize
her
instantly
i
expect
you
would
give
a
great
deal
to
get
the
girl
out
of
your
way
said
the
maid
artfully
chapter
xxviii
elinor
lifted
her
flashing
eyes
and
looked
at
the
maid
struck
by
her
words
yes
she
answered
boldly
i
would
give
anything
i
possess
to
anyone
who
would
remove
her
from
my
path
without
my
agency
being
known
in
the
matter
you
would
not
care
by
what
means
asked
celine
no
declared
the
young
lady
celine
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
coming
nearer
to
elinor
whispered
softly
what
will
you
give
me
miss
glenalvan
if
i
will
have
the
girl
driven
out
under
a
disgraceful
ban
this
very
night
can
you
do
it
inquired
elinor
eagerly
easily
was
the
confident
reply
if
you
will
make
it
worth
my
while
to
do
so
elinor
revolved
the
words
a
moment
in
her
mind
she
saw
that
services
would
have
to
be
amply
requited
otherwise
the
selfish
creature
would
not
trouble
herself
to
help
her
out
of
her
difficulty
you
know
i
am
not
well
off
celine
she
said
but
father
has
promised
to
send
me
some
money
this
month
to
buy
my
winter
outfit
to
tell
the
truth
i
shall
need
every
cent
of
it
for
i
scarcely
a
decent
thing
to
wear
this
winter
but
if
you
will
get
the
girl
away
before
chesleigh
sees
her
i
will
divide
my
allowance
with
you
how
much
money
has
your
father
agreed
to
send
you
inquired
the
rapacious
woman
three
hundred
dollars
replied
elinor
and
i
will
give
you
of
it
if
you
will
do
me
this
service
she
felt
as
if
she
making
a
very
liberal
offer
and
was
surprised
when
the
frenchwoman
shook
her
head
a
hundred
and
fifty
would
not
pay
me
for
the
trouble
she
said
conclusively
elinor
looked
at
her
a
little
blankly
but
do
you
understand
celine
that
i
can
not
spare
any
more
she
said
i
must
keep
enough
to
buy
a
decent
dress
and
hat
and
cloak
for
the
winter
that
matters
not
to
me
replied
celine
with
the
utmost
indifference
you
must
either
give
me
the
whole
three
hundred
or
i
will
not
help
you
elinor
was
angered
and
amazed
at
the
woman
shameless
rapacity
i
will
not
do
it
she
exclaimed
i
dare
say
golden
will
go
away
of
herself
anyhow
i
do
not
intend
to
be
fleeced
so
shamelessly
as
you
please
miss
replied
the
maid
coolly
she
had
the
game
in
her
own
hands
and
was
insolently
aware
of
the
fact
i
not
anxious
to
accommodate
you
i
dare
say
i
could
make
more
by
selling
my
secret
do
you
think
chesleigh
would
give
me
a
thousand
dollars
for
telling
him
where
to
find
his
missing
sweetheart
elinor
grew
frightened
and
acquiescent
all
in
a
moment
at
baleful
threat
oh
celine
do
do
that
she
cried
i
was
only
joking
when
i
said
i
would
not
do
it
you
shall
have
every
dollar
of
the
money
if
you
will
get
golden
away
as
you
said
you
would
i
thought
i
should
bring
you
to
your
senses
muttered
celine
then
she
added
aloud
thank
you
miss
are
you
sure
that
your
father
will
send
the
money
he
promised
to
do
so
without
fail
replied
elinor
and
you
will
really
hand
it
over
to
me
as
soon
as
received
yes
then
you
may
consider
the
little
marplot
gone
in
less
than
an
hour
you
will
see
her
leaving
this
hotel
followed
by
desmond
curse
replied
celine
with
perfect
confidence
in
her
power
of
executing
the
task
she
had
undertaken
what
do
you
mean
how
will
you
accomplish
it
inquired
elinor
never
mind
about
that
i
will
do
as
i
said
never
fear
are
you
done
with
me
now
miss
glenalvan
if
you
are
i
will
go
to
desmond
she
will
need
me
to
do
her
hair
you
may
go
celine
replied
the
young
lady
now
be
sure
a
little
nervously
that
you
do
not
implicate
in
the
affair
trust
me
for
managing
everything
all
right
was
the
airy
reply
she
went
out
and
made
her
way
to
the
of
her
mistress
desmond
was
sitting
before
the
with
a
small
open
in
her
lap
she
was
turning
over
some
pretty
rings
with
her
white
fingers
celine
went
up
to
the
table
and
began
to
get
out
the
combs
and
brushes
are
you
ready
for
me
to
do
your
hair
she
inquired
in
a
moment
replied
desmond
i
am
looking
over
my
rings
now
i
want
to
select
one
of
the
neatest
and
plainest
for
a
present
to
someone
celine
simpered
and
coughed
she
fully
expected
to
become
the
fortunate
recipient
i
must
confess
that
i
have
been
mistaken
for
once
continued
desmond
half
to
herself
when
the
girl
came
here
first
i
was
prejudiced
against
her
partly
because
she
was
so
pretty
and
and
again
because
we
had
had
so
many
hateful
nurses
i
thought
she
must
necessarily
be
like
them
but
i
was
for
once
happily
mistaken
she
has
been
so
humble
and
unobtrusive
and
endeared
herself
so
much
to
my
little
girl
that
i
must
really
reward
her
for
her
good
care
of
my
darling
during
my
absence
of
whom
are
you
speaking
inquired
celine
green
with
envy
as
the
lady
paused
having
selected
a
plain
gold
band
set
with
a
single
shining
white
pearl
of
mary
smith
desmond
replied
and
i
am
going
to
give
her
this
ring
in
token
of
my
respect
for
her
good
character
and
my
gratitude
for
the
really
motherly
care
which
she
has
taken
of
my
dear
frail
little
ruby
chapter
xxix
at
desmond
words
celine
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
remained
silent
the
lady
glanced
up
at
her
in
some
surprise
what
is
the
matter
celine
she
inquired
do
you
not
think
i
am
right
to
acknowledge
my
appreciation
of
her
valuable
services
the
maid
only
sighed
more
deeply
casting
down
her
eyes
as
if
in
great
distress
i
hope
you
are
not
jealous
celine
continued
her
mistress
you
know
i
have
given
you
many
such
testimonials
of
my
favor
yes
that
you
have
and
i
not
jealous
not
a
bit
dear
mistress
cried
celine
but
oh
dear
oh
dear
that
you
should
have
been
so
cruelly
deceived
and
betrayed
celine
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
lady
disturbed
oh
my
dear
lady
i
hate
to
grieve
you
but
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
imposed
upon
any
longer
by
that
shameless
girl
oh
my
dear
mistress
where
are
your
eyes
that
you
ca
see
her
disgrace
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
told
all
i
knew
at
first
cried
celine
wringing
her
hands
while
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
desmond
sprang
up
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
excitedly
speak
what
is
it
that
you
know
she
cried
passionately
have
i
been
deceived
in
mary
smith
yes
my
dear
lady
most
cruelly
deceived
exclaimed
celine
but
she
has
certainly
been
kind
to
the
child
else
ruby
would
have
complained
said
desmond
in
perplexity
oh
yes
she
was
kind
to
the
child
i
admit
but
it
was
all
for
a
blind
and
all
the
all
the
while
oh
desmond
if
you
could
only
understand
without
my
telling
it
cried
celine
breaking
off
abruptly
with
an
appearance
of
grief
and
reluctance
the
passionate
jealous
heart
of
the
listener
caught
the
artful
bait
instantly
she
gasped
for
breath
her
brilliant
face
whitened
to
a
marble
pallor
and
she
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
herself
if
celine
had
not
been
utterly
selfish
and
pitiless
she
must
have
retracted
her
cruel
lie
in
the
face
of
that
utter
despair
on
the
beautiful
face
of
her
mistress
but
the
greed
of
gold
overpowered
every
other
consideration
in
her
base
mind
celine
the
startled
woman
broke
out
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
husband
she
paused
and
her
blazing
eyes
searched
the
woman
face
your
husband
loves
her
alas
yes
my
poor
deceived
mistress
cried
the
maid
the
deceitful
creature
has
won
his
heart
from
you
there
was
a
moment
silence
while
desmond
groped
blindly
in
her
mind
for
some
tangible
proof
on
which
to
pin
her
faith
in
her
beloved
husband
celine
you
must
be
mistaken
she
exclaimed
you
know
we
have
been
away
from
home
almost
the
whole
time
since
the
girl
came
to
us
she
has
had
no
chance
with
my
husband
alas
desmond
you
force
me
to
tell
you
sighed
celine
know
then
that
it
all
began
before
you
went
south
to
chesleigh
the
very
day
after
she
came
i
caught
desmond
kissing
mary
smith
with
his
arms
around
her
waist
celine
will
you
swear
to
this
gasped
the
unhappy
wife
i
will
take
my
bible
oath
to
its
truth
was
the
emphatic
reply
then
god
help
me
moaned
the
stricken
woman
celine
why
did
you
not
tell
me
all
this
before
i
was
afraid
of
master
anger
she
replied
he
threatened
me
and
i
promised
not
to
tell
oh
my
dear
lady
will
you
promise
to
shield
me
from
his
wrath
i
could
not
see
you
so
imposed
on
any
longer
so
the
affair
has
been
going
on
from
bad
to
worse
celine
inquired
her
mistress
faintly
yes
my
dear
mistress
you
remember
how
anxious
he
was
to
return
to
new
york
and
take
little
miss
ruby
to
the
seashore
it
was
all
an
excuse
to
get
back
to
the
nurse
and
since
we
came
back
yesterday
well
i
told
enough
already
are
you
angry
with
me
my
dear
injured
lady
inquired
celine
breaking
off
artfully
just
where
she
really
had
nothing
more
to
tell
unless
she
had
fabricated
a
wholesale
lie
desmond
shook
her
head
and
remained
silent
the
maid
was
disappointed
she
had
expected
a
wild
outpouring
of
anger
from
the
jealous
wife
but
instead
she
preserved
an
ominous
quiet
her
head
drooped
on
her
bosom
her
face
was
colorless
as
death
her
wild
burning
dark
eyes
were
the
only
signs
of
life
in
her
celine
was
a
little
startled
at
the
effect
of
her
wickedness
she
brought
some
de
and
tried
to
bathe
the
face
of
her
mistress
but
was
quickly
motioned
away
go
celine
send
that
girl
here
to
me
she
said
speaking
in
a
dry
hard
unnatural
voice
the
maid
went
out
and
desmond
waited
but
a
moment
before
the
door
unclasped
and
little
golden
entered
she
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
in
her
gentle
voice
you
sent
for
me
mrs
desmond
desmond
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
beautiful
girl
whom
she
believed
to
be
the
wicked
destroyer
of
her
happiness
golden
shrank
before
the
withering
scorn
of
that
look
oh
madam
is
anything
the
matter
she
faltered
desmond
rose
and
towered
above
her
in
all
the
dignity
of
her
insulted
wifehood
oh
no
she
said
in
a
low
deep
voice
of
concentrated
passion
there
is
very
little
the
matter
only
this
trifle
you
have
shamelessly
robbed
me
of
my
husband
madam
cried
golden
in
alarm
and
consternation
you
need
not
pretend
innocence
you
can
not
deceive
me
cried
the
outraged
wife
you
have
won
his
heart
you
have
stolen
him
from
me
and
you
have
forever
ruined
my
life
oh
madam
who
has
told
you
this
dreadful
tale
it
is
not
true
i
would
sooner
die
than
wrong
you
cried
golden
with
pitiful
earnestness
hush
do
not
lie
to
me
exclaimed
desmond
lifting
and
pointing
a
scornful
finger
at
the
shrinking
form
your
looks
declare
your
shame
go
leave
the
house
this
moment
wretched
creature
before
in
my
madness
i
lay
violent
hands
on
you
but
golden
did
not
go
she
knelt
down
before
her
angry
accuser
and
looked
up
at
her
pleadingly
oh
desmond
you
are
mistaken
you
wrong
me
bitterly
by
such
a
suspicion
she
cried
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
fair
cheeks
wrong
you
desmond
cried
are
you
not
then
she
bent
and
fairly
hissed
the
remaining
words
into
the
girl
ear
golden
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
cry
of
dismay
oh
my
god
this
is
too
horrible
she
wailed
how
can
i
bear
it
did
i
not
speak
the
truth
desmond
demanded
it
is
true
madam
i
can
not
deny
it
replied
the
girl
crimson
with
burning
blushes
but
i
oh
i
call
heaven
to
witness
my
truth
desmond
i
am
nothing
to
your
husband
i
was
was
married
before
i
came
to
you
then
where
is
your
husband
i
can
not
tell
faltered
the
white
lips
that
is
strange
said
desmond
scornfully
has
he
left
you
yes
madam
with
a
pitiful
droop
of
the
fair
head
why
did
he
do
so
inquired
the
lady
i
can
not
tell
you
golden
murmured
sorrowfully
ah
if
desmond
had
only
known
the
truth
that
it
was
her
wife
kneeling
there
ashamed
and
dejected
before
her
but
she
did
not
dream
it
and
her
anger
rose
at
the
girl
unsatisfactory
replies
to
her
questions
i
will
not
ask
you
any
more
questions
she
said
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
more
of
your
weak
falsehoods
get
up
from
there
and
go
leave
the
house
now
and
at
once
before
i
publish
your
conduct
to
everyone
you
need
not
go
to
markham
for
sympathy
i
shall
go
to
her
at
once
and
tell
her
what
you
are
golden
stood
still
staring
at
her
blankly
a
moment
she
was
dazed
and
frightened
at
the
shameful
suspicion
that
had
fallen
upon
her
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
convince
desmond
of
her
innocence
oh
madam
if
i
could
only
induce
you
to
believe
that
i
am
not
the
vile
creature
you
think
me
she
cried
in
anguish
hush
leave
the
room
desmond
answered
stormily
go
and
take
with
you
the
bitterest
curse
of
an
injured
woman
may
the
good
god
speedily
avenge
my
cruel
wrongs
she
crossed
to
the
door
threw
it
open
and
pointed
silently
to
it
golden
obeyed
the
mute
sentence
of
her
lifted
finger
and
glided
out
a
forlorn
little
figure
feeling
almost
annihilated
by
the
vivid
lightning
of
desmond
angry
eyes
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
her
and
she
walked
along
through
the
brightly
lighted
hotel
corridor
for
the
twilight
had
fallen
long
ago
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
and
golden
shrank
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
encountering
the
black
inclement
night
the
thought
came
to
her
why
should
she
go
she
was
ill
friendless
almost
penniless
it
was
her
husband
right
to
protect
her
and
here
she
was
passing
his
very
door
should
she
not
appeal
to
him
for
comfort
in
this
terrible
hour
her
trembling
limbs
refused
to
carry
her
past
his
door
she
turned
the
handle
with
a
weak
and
trembling
hand
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
chapter
xxx
when
golden
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
had
entered
the
room
that
she
knew
was
bertram
chesleigh
she
stood
frightened
and
trembling
inside
the
closed
door
afraid
to
look
up
at
first
at
the
man
who
had
treated
her
so
cruelly
gathering
courage
at
the
shuddering
remembrance
of
the
terrors
that
awaited
her
in
the
darkness
of
the
gloomy
night
outside
she
looked
up
at
last
determined
to
make
at
least
one
appeal
to
her
husband
the
gas
had
been
lighted
and
it
threw
a
flood
of
brightness
over
every
object
in
the
room
on
a
sofa
at
the
further
end
bertram
chesleigh
lay
sleeping
in
a
careless
position
as
if
he
had
just
thrown
himself
down
wearied
and
overcome
with
fatigue
the
hair
was
tossed
carelessly
back
from
his
high
white
brow
and
the
thick
dark
lashes
lay
heavily
upon
his
cheeks
as
if
his
slumber
was
deep
and
dreamless
a
small
table
was
drawn
closely
to
his
side
littered
with
writing
materials
and
a
pen
with
the
ink
scarcely
dried
upon
it
lay
beside
a
letter
just
stamped
and
sealed
and
addressed
to
richard
leith
no
park
avenue
new
york
as
golden
glided
across
the
room
and
paused
with
her
small
hand
resting
upon
the
table
the
superscription
of
the
letter
caught
her
eyes
by
the
merest
chance
she
started
caught
it
up
in
her
hand
and
scanned
it
eagerly
richard
leith
she
read
and
her
voice
trembled
with
eagerness
how
strange
why
is
he
writing
to
richard
leith
she
glanced
at
the
sleeper
but
not
the
quiver
of
an
eyelash
betrayed
disturbance
at
her
presence
she
drew
a
slip
of
paper
toward
her
and
neatly
copied
the
address
from
the
letter
placing
it
securely
in
her
little
purse
then
she
paused
turning
another
wistful
glance
from
the
letter
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
to
the
pale
handsome
face
of
the
husband
who
had
discarded
her
because
she
had
been
born
to
a
heritage
of
shame
she
wondered
again
if
bertram
chesleigh
knew
richard
leith
and
why
he
had
written
to
him
but
no
thought
of
the
truth
came
into
her
mind
or
how
gladly
she
would
have
flown
to
the
quiet
sleeper
and
folded
him
in
her
loving
arms
and
sobbed
out
her
gladness
on
his
broad
breast
instead
she
stood
gazing
at
him
a
few
moments
in
troubled
silence
the
hanging
like
pearls
on
her
thick
golden
lashes
her
breast
heaving
with
suppressed
sighs
then
she
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
her
first
impulse
to
awaken
him
having
been
diverted
into
another
course
by
her
opportune
discovery
of
the
address
of
the
man
whom
she
believed
to
be
her
father
bertram
would
only
despise
and
defy
me
if
i
appealed
to
him
perhaps
she
murmured
i
will
seek
my
misguided
mother
instead
she
gave
him
one
sad
reproachful
glance
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
as
she
closed
the
door
it
inadvertently
slammed
and
awakened
the
sleeper
he
started
up
confusedly
passing
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
looking
up
for
the
person
whom
he
supposed
had
entered
the
room
i
distinctly
heard
the
door
slam
he
said
to
himself
someone
either
entered
or
left
the
room
but
as
no
one
appeared
he
concluded
that
someone
had
entered
and
finding
him
asleep
had
gone
out
again
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
lighted
corridor
no
one
was
visible
and
he
was
about
to
close
the
door
again
when
his
sister
edith
came
suddenly
in
sight
he
waited
until
she
came
up
to
him
her
dark
silk
dress
rustling
as
she
moved
hurriedly
along
come
in
edith
he
said
i
am
sorry
i
was
asleep
when
you
came
in
just
now
why
did
you
not
awaken
me
i
was
only
dozing
the
closing
of
the
door
awakened
me
instantly
she
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
and
then
he
saw
that
her
brilliant
face
was
quite
pale
and
her
dark
eyes
had
a
strange
unnatural
glare
in
them
i
have
not
been
in
your
room
since
morning
she
replied
what
made
you
think
so
bert
someone
must
have
come
in
and
gone
out
again
for
i
was
awakened
by
the
closing
of
the
door
and
i
thought
at
first
it
must
have
been
you
doubtless
it
was
only
a
servant
it
does
not
matter
but
edith
has
anything
happened
you
look
pale
and
strange
she
threw
herself
down
into
a
chair
and
her
unnatural
calm
gave
way
to
a
flood
of
tears
chesleigh
was
shocked
and
distressed
he
bent
over
her
and
entreated
her
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
her
grief
checking
her
tears
by
a
great
effort
of
will
desmond
told
him
all
that
had
passed
i
will
never
live
with
desmond
again
she
said
passionately
when
she
had
finished
her
story
ever
since
we
married
he
has
outraged
my
love
and
my
pride
by
his
glaring
flirtations
but
this
last
affair
is
too
grievous
and
shameful
to
be
tamely
endured
i
hate
him
for
his
falsehood
and
infidelity
and
i
will
never
live
with
him
again
edith
think
of
the
scandal
the
notoriety
if
you
leave
your
husband
he
remonstrated
i
do
not
care
she
replied
her
dark
eyes
blazing
with
wrath
and
defiance
let
them
say
what
they
will
i
will
not
tamely
endure
such
a
cruel
insult
you
must
make
some
arrangement
for
me
bertie
for
i
will
never
never
live
with
desmond
again
and
bertram
chesleigh
with
his
heart
on
fire
at
his
beloved
wrongs
and
his
brain
puzzled
over
the
best
way
to
right
them
little
dreamed
that
his
own
weakness
and
had
been
the
sole
cause
of
her
sorrow
his
fiery
indignation
was
spent
upon
his
when
it
should
have
been
bestowed
upon
himself
chapter
xxxi
i
will
not
go
in
to
bid
little
ruby
farewell
golden
said
to
herself
sadly
as
she
left
the
room
of
bertram
chesleigh
the
little
one
loves
me
and
i
could
not
bear
her
grief
at
parting
with
me
i
will
slip
into
the
next
room
without
her
knowledge
get
my
hat
and
jacket
and
go
away
quietly
when
i
am
gone
perhaps
desmond
may
become
reconciled
to
her
husband
she
did
not
dream
that
the
proud
woman
anger
and
resentment
against
her
husband
would
carry
her
to
the
length
of
a
separation
with
him
she
donned
her
hat
and
jacket
and
tied
her
few
articles
of
clothing
into
a
compact
bundle
taking
them
in
her
hand
she
stole
noiselessly
out
and
made
her
way
to
the
lower
portico
of
the
great
hotel
she
paused
there
a
little
dismayed
and
looked
out
at
the
black
and
starless
night
with
the
chill
september
drizzle
falling
ceaselessly
she
would
be
obliged
to
walk
two
miles
through
the
storm
to
take
the
midnight
train
for
new
york
it
would
have
been
perfectly
easy
to
have
hired
a
conveyance
but
she
had
only
nine
dollars
left
in
her
purse
after
discharging
her
debt
to
markham
and
not
knowing
how
much
her
fare
to
the
city
might
be
she
was
afraid
to
waste
a
penny
in
hack
hire
she
decided
that
she
must
walk
so
unfurling
her
small
as
some
slight
protection
against
the
beating
rain
she
plunged
with
a
shiver
into
the
wet
and
darkness
of
the
untoward
night
she
groped
along
wearily
in
the
dreary
road
scarcely
conscious
of
her
physical
discomfort
and
peril
in
the
agonizing
pain
and
humiliation
that
ached
at
her
heart
she
had
been
driven
forth
under
the
ban
of
cruel
shame
and
disgrace
bertram
chesleigh
would
hear
the
story
of
ruby
wicked
deceitful
nurse
and
would
hate
her
memory
little
thinking
that
it
was
his
own
wretched
wife
and
that
she
had
borne
desmond
angry
charge
without
defending
herself
and
all
for
his
sake
because
he
was
too
proud
to
acknowledge
her
claim
on
him
the
weary
walk
was
accomplished
at
last
and
golden
waited
several
hours
in
her
wet
and
draggled
garments
in
the
fireless
room
at
the
station
for
the
train
that
was
to
take
her
to
new
york
it
came
at
last
and
in
a
few
more
miserable
hours
she
was
safe
in
the
city
she
found
after
paying
her
fare
that
she
had
enough
left
to
pay
for
a
bed
and
breakfast
at
a
hotel
and
gladly
availed
herself
of
the
privilege
wretched
and
impatient
as
she
felt
her
overstrained
mind
yielded
to
the
physical
weakness
that
was
stealing
over
her
and
she
slept
soundly
for
several
hours
rising
refreshed
and
strengthened
she
made
a
substantial
breakfast
and
sallied
for
no
park
avenue
she
hardly
knew
what
she
would
do
when
she
arrived
there
but
the
conviction
was
strong
upon
her
that
she
must
go
she
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
number
the
house
was
large
and
elegant
with
a
flight
of
brown
stone
steps
in
front
golden
climbed
them
a
little
timidly
and
rang
the
bell
the
servant
in
waiting
stared
at
her
cheap
attire
a
little
superciliously
as
he
opened
the
door
but
when
she
inquired
if
leith
were
at
home
his
aspect
changed
oh
you
are
come
in
answer
to
the
advertisement
for
a
maid
he
said
yes
my
mistress
is
at
home
and
she
will
see
you
at
once
come
this
way
golden
followed
him
in
silence
to
the
lady
the
thought
came
to
her
that
this
would
be
an
admirable
pretext
for
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
leiths
so
she
did
not
deny
that
she
was
seeking
a
situation
a
beautiful
lady
opened
the
door
at
her
timid
knock
the
girl
heart
gave
a
great
muffled
throb
my
mother
she
thought
chapter
xxxii
leith
this
is
a
young
woman
who
has
answered
the
advertisement
for
a
maid
said
the
man
respectfully
as
he
turned
away
the
beautiful
lady
nodded
golden
to
a
seat
and
looked
at
her
with
careless
condescension
what
is
your
name
she
inquired
mary
smith
answered
the
girl
in
a
low
fluttering
voice
have
you
any
recommendations
not
as
a
maid
as
the
occupation
is
new
to
me
i
have
been
a
nurse
heretofore
but
if
you
will
try
me
i
will
do
my
best
to
please
you
said
golden
anxiously
i
am
very
hard
to
please
said
leith
she
did
not
tell
golden
that
she
was
so
very
hard
to
please
that
no
one
could
suit
her
leaving
her
to
find
that
out
for
herself
as
she
would
be
sure
to
do
if
she
remained
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
golden
gravely
regarded
leith
she
was
and
graceful
in
form
with
large
blue
eyes
waving
masses
of
golden
hair
and
features
she
was
barely
thirty
years
old
in
appearance
and
was
richly
and
becomingly
attired
yet
golden
shivered
and
trembled
as
she
regarded
the
fair
smiling
beauty
how
could
she
look
so
bright
and
careless
with
the
brand
of
deadly
sin
upon
her
there
was
neither
sorrow
nor
repentance
on
the
smiling
debonair
face
and
this
is
my
mother
golden
thought
to
herself
with
a
strange
heaviness
at
her
heart
she
seems
utterly
indifferent
at
her
wickedness
ah
she
little
dreams
that
the
poor
babe
that
she
deserted
so
heartlessly
is
sitting
before
her
now
leith
light
careless
voice
jarred
suddenly
on
her
mournful
mood
well
i
will
try
you
mary
for
i
need
a
maid
my
last
one
was
so
incapable
i
had
to
discharge
her
you
may
do
my
hair
for
me
now
i
am
going
to
drive
in
the
park
with
leith
if
his
troublesome
clients
do
not
detain
him
my
husband
is
a
lawyer
mary
and
his
time
is
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
his
business
her
husband
golden
repeated
to
herself
as
she
wound
the
shining
tresses
into
braids
so
they
keep
up
that
farce
before
the
world
poor
mother
how
she
must
love
my
father
to
remain
with
him
on
such
humiliating
terms
is
she
really
happy
or
does
she
only
wear
a
mask
but
there
was
no
apparent
sorrow
or
remorse
on
the
complacent
face
of
the
lady
as
she
gave
her
orders
and
directions
to
the
new
maid
the
uppermost
thought
in
her
mind
was
how
to
make
the
most
of
her
beauty
golden
had
to
arrange
her
hair
twice
before
she
was
suited
and
she
tried
several
dresses
in
turn
before
she
decided
on
one
she
was
inordinately
vain
and
fond
of
finery
and
golden
thought
pitifully
to
herself
her
beauty
is
the
only
hold
she
has
on
my
father
and
she
is
compelled
to
make
its
preservation
the
sole
aim
of
her
life
she
wondered
a
little
that
no
yearning
throb
had
stirred
her
heart
at
the
sight
of
her
beautiful
mother
but
she
told
herself
that
it
was
simply
because
her
mother
sin
had
wholly
alienated
the
natural
affection
of
her
daughter
she
pitied
her
with
a
great
yearning
pity
but
no
impulse
prompted
her
to
kiss
the
dewy
crimson
lips
she
had
no
temptation
to
pillow
her
head
on
the
fair
bosom
that
had
denied
its
shelter
and
sustenance
to
her
helpless
infancy
leith
did
not
look
as
if
she
would
have
made
a
tender
mother
have
you
any
children
madam
she
asked
suddenly
and
leith
answered
no
rather
shortly
but
added
a
minute
later
and
i
am
glad
of
it
for
i
do
not
love
children
but
leith
does
and
is
rather
sorry
that
we
have
none
he
is
justly
punished
for
his
sin
thought
his
unknown
daughter
while
she
secretly
wondered
why
he
had
never
claimed
the
child
his
wife
had
heartlessly
deserted
to
return
to
him
perhaps
she
told
him
i
was
dead
thought
golden
looking
at
the
beautiful
woman
with
a
strange
thrill
of
repulsion
perhaps
he
would
have
loved
me
and
cared
for
me
had
he
known
i
lived
a
thrill
of
pity
half
mixed
with
tenderness
stirred
her
heart
for
the
father
who
had
been
cheated
of
the
child
he
would
have
loved
she
became
conscious
of
a
burning
desire
to
meet
her
father
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
mother
and
who
had
been
wronged
in
turn
in
that
he
had
never
beheld
the
face
of
his
child
there
was
a
manly
step
at
the
door
and
it
opened
admitting
a
tall
handsome
man
in
the
prime
of
life
golden
heart
gave
a
quick
wild
throb
then
sank
heavily
in
her
breast
she
retreated
hastily
to
the
shade
of
a
where
she
could
observe
the
herself
unobserved
richard
leith
was
tall
dark
and
very
handsome
though
there
were
threads
in
his
dark
waving
hair
and
in
the
long
magnificent
beard
that
rippled
down
upon
his
breast
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
known
trouble
and
sorrow
his
face
was
both
sad
and
stern
and
his
dark
eyes
were
cold
and
gloomy
leith
looked
up
at
him
carelessly
and
his
grave
face
did
not
brighten
at
the
sight
of
her
beauty
enhanced
as
it
was
by
the
rich
blue
silk
and
becoming
white
lace
bonnet
with
its
garland
of
roses
are
you
ready
for
your
drive
mrs
leith
he
inquired
with
punctilious
politeness
yes
i
am
just
ready
she
replied
carelessly
you
see
i
have
a
new
maid
she
is
rather
awkward
but
i
shall
keep
her
until
i
can
do
better
leith
gave
an
indifferent
nod
toward
the
gray
gown
and
white
cap
that
was
dimly
visible
at
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
then
he
went
out
with
his
wife
and
golden
sank
down
upon
the
carpet
and
wept
some
bitter
bitter
tears
that
seemed
to
lift
a
little
bit
of
the
load
of
grief
from
her
oppressed
bosom
after
all
she
had
found
her
father
and
mother
and
it
was
possible
that
she
might
bring
them
to
see
the
wickedness
of
their
course
and
to
seek
reformation
she
determined
not
to
reveal
her
identity
just
yet
she
would
stay
with
them
a
little
and
learn
more
of
them
before
she
made
her
strong
appeal
to
them
in
behalf
of
truth
she
would
not
reproach
them
just
yet
for
the
blight
they
had
cast
on
her
innocent
life
she
would
patiently
bide
her
time
it
was
a
strange
position
to
be
placed
in
under
the
roof
of
her
own
parents
unknown
and
unacknowledged
with
her
whole
life
laid
bare
and
desolate
through
their
sin
a
hot
and
passionate
resentment
against
them
surged
up
into
wounded
heart
what
right
had
her
mother
to
be
so
fair
and
happy
when
she
had
sinned
so
grievously
perhaps
she
would
be
very
angry
when
she
knew
that
the
child
she
had
so
pitilessly
deserted
had
hunted
her
down
to
confront
her
with
her
sin
i
will
wait
a
little
i
will
not
speak
yet
she
said
i
shall
know
them
better
after
awhile
and
i
shall
know
how
to
approach
them
better
so
the
days
waned
and
faded
golden
began
to
become
very
well
acquainted
with
the
beautiful
woman
whom
she
believed
to
be
her
mother
she
was
vain
frivolous
heartless
the
girl
recoiled
instinctively
from
her
but
she
could
not
understand
leith
so
well
he
was
a
mystery
to
her
some
settled
shadow
seemed
to
brood
heavily
over
him
always
he
was
engrossed
with
his
studies
and
business
golden
wondered
if
it
was
remorse
that
preyed
so
heavily
on
him
she
had
never
seen
a
smile
on
the
stern
lips
there
was
one
thing
that
struck
her
strangely
richard
leith
and
his
wife
did
not
appear
very
fond
of
each
other
the
gentleman
was
studiously
courteous
polite
and
kind
but
golden
never
saw
on
his
expressive
face
that
light
of
adoring
tenderness
she
had
loved
to
see
on
bertram
chesleigh
whenever
he
looked
at
her
leith
was
totally
absorbed
in
her
dresses
her
novels
and
her
daily
drives
during
which
she
excited
much
admiration
by
her
beauty
and
her
exquisite
toilets
but
love
and
passion
these
seemed
to
be
themes
between
the
pair
they
addressed
each
other
formally
as
and
leith
but
golden
had
noticed
that
the
clothing
was
marked
she
knew
of
course
that
the
letter
stood
for
golden
but
when
she
asked
her
about
it
with
apparent
carelessness
one
day
the
lady
answered
that
it
was
for
gertrude
she
has
discarded
even
her
name
her
daughter
mused
bitterly
perhaps
she
has
even
forgotten
her
old
home
and
her
deserted
father
and
her
little
child
and
in
spite
of
herself
golden
felt
that
she
heartily
despised
the
woman
whom
she
should
have
loved
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
because
she
was
her
mother
but
some
strange
and
subtle
fascination
drew
her
nearer
and
nearer
to
richard
leith
her
anger
and
scorn
which
she
had
tried
to
foster
at
first
began
to
dissolve
in
spite
of
herself
into
a
yearning
and
sorrowful
tenderness
chapter
xxxiii
several
weeks
went
by
and
golden
wondered
very
much
if
the
desmonds
had
returned
to
the
city
and
if
the
lady
still
held
her
unjust
suspicions
and
jealousy
against
her
she
often
wondered
as
she
looked
at
richard
leith
stern
set
face
why
bertram
chesleigh
had
written
to
him
and
for
what
object
one
day
she
heard
leith
remark
to
her
husband
that
she
had
seen
desmond
driving
in
the
park
alone
that
morning
he
looked
pale
and
dejected
quite
unlike
himself
she
added
i
wonder
if
his
handsome
wife
and
little
daughter
are
at
the
seaside
yet
did
you
not
know
said
leith
desmond
and
ruby
have
gone
to
europe
with
chesleigh
gone
without
her
husband
cried
the
lady
how
strange
do
you
not
think
so
not
strange
when
you
hear
the
circumstances
leith
replied
gravely
the
truth
is
desmond
became
violently
jealous
of
a
pretty
servant
girl
and
declared
she
would
leave
him
even
threatened
a
divorce
to
save
publicity
her
brother
persuaded
her
to
take
a
trip
with
him
to
europe
hoping
that
time
might
soften
her
anger
you
understand
that
these
are
not
public
facts
leith
they
came
to
me
personally
as
the
desmonds
lawyer
i
shall
not
repeat
them
she
replied
taking
the
gentle
hint
do
you
think
she
will
ever
be
reconciled
mr
leith
i
scarcely
think
so
desmond
is
perfectly
implacable
at
present
desmond
employed
me
as
a
mediator
between
them
but
i
could
accomplish
nothing
he
swears
that
she
was
unjustly
jealous
and
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
between
him
and
the
girl
but
i
could
not
induce
chesleigh
nor
his
sister
to
believe
the
assertion
what
became
of
the
girl
inquired
leith
desmond
drove
the
wretched
creature
away
it
is
not
known
what
became
of
her
replied
the
lawyer
altogether
it
is
a
very
sad
affair
chesleigh
has
acted
on
my
advice
in
taking
his
sister
out
of
the
country
for
awhile
i
pity
bertram
chesleigh
he
has
had
a
bad
entanglement
himself
lately
which
he
has
been
compelled
to
place
in
my
hands
but
poor
boy
i
fear
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
he
is
trying
to
get
a
divorce
from
me
thought
golden
with
a
dizzy
horror
in
her
mind
and
the
bitter
agony
of
the
thought
drove
the
color
from
her
face
and
the
life
from
her
heart
with
an
exceeding
bitter
cry
she
threw
up
her
arms
in
the
air
staggered
blindly
forward
and
fell
heavily
upon
the
floor
what
is
that
cried
leith
looking
round
with
a
great
start
why
it
mary
smith
i
had
forgotten
that
she
was
in
the
room
cried
leith
oh
look
she
is
dead
she
began
to
wring
her
hands
excitedly
but
leith
said
quietly
do
not
alarm
yourself
she
has
only
fainted
i
suppose
bring
some
water
and
we
will
soon
revive
her
she
ran
into
the
and
leith
bent
down
over
the
prostrate
form
and
lifted
the
drooping
head
compassionately
the
ugly
concealing
cap
and
glasses
had
fallen
off
and
as
his
gaze
rested
fully
on
the
lovely
face
a
cry
of
surprise
and
anguish
broke
from
his
lips
my
god
how
terribly
like
he
muttered
then
as
leith
returned
with
water
and
de
he
applied
them
both
without
the
slightest
success
for
golden
still
lay
cold
white
and
rigid
like
one
dead
upon
his
arm
is
she
dead
leith
whispered
fearfully
i
can
not
tell
ring
for
the
housekeeper
perhaps
she
may
know
better
how
to
apply
the
remedies
he
replied
still
holding
the
light
form
in
his
arms
and
gazing
with
a
dazed
expression
on
the
beautiful
unconscious
face
the
housekeeper
came
and
declared
in
a
fright
at
first
that
the
girl
was
dead
then
she
turned
leith
out
of
the
room
loosened
clothing
and
rubbed
her
vigorously
in
about
ten
minutes
the
quiet
eyelids
fluttered
faintly
and
a
gasping
sigh
parted
the
white
lips
the
housekeeper
beckoned
leith
to
her
side
she
lives
she
whispered
softly
but
she
had
better
have
died
i
do
not
understand
you
leith
replied
i
have
made
a
discovery
continued
the
old
housekeeper
the
girl
has
deceived
you
madam
she
is
a
bad
lot
for
all
her
sweet
childish
innocent
face
deceived
me
how
leith
demanded
she
is
not
an
innocent
maiden
as
she
appeared
oh
leith
can
you
not
see
for
yourself
the
wretched
creature
is
likely
to
become
a
mother
in
a
few
short
months
you
are
jesting
she
is
barely
more
than
a
child
leith
broke
out
incredulously
it
the
lord
truth
madam
faugh
the
wicked
little
piece
a
pity
i
had
let
her
die
sniffed
the
virtuous
housekeeper
with
a
scornful
glance
at
the
reviving
girl
chapter
xxxiv
leith
drew
back
her
trailing
silken
skirts
from
contact
with
poor
golden
recumbent
form
as
if
there
were
contamination
in
her
very
touch
i
have
been
terribly
deceived
she
said
i
had
begun
to
like
the
girl
very
much
she
suited
me
more
than
any
maid
i
have
had
for
a
long
while
and
i
thought
her
quite
pure
and
respectable
do
the
best
you
can
for
her
brown
for
i
shall
send
her
away
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
walk
heedless
of
golden
large
blue
eyes
that
unclosed
and
fixed
themselves
reproachfully
upon
her
she
swept
from
the
room
and
sought
leith
to
whom
she
confided
the
housekeeper
discovery
the
lawyer
looked
shocked
and
distressed
unaccountably
so
the
lady
thought
i
can
scarcely
credit
it
he
said
she
has
such
an
innocent
and
face
such
faces
are
sometimes
deceiving
remarked
the
lady
this
instance
proves
the
fact
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
the
poor
child
leith
asked
with
an
unconscious
sigh
i
shall
send
her
away
of
course
leith
replied
decidedly
oh
unnatural
said
a
faint
reproachful
voice
behind
her
she
turned
with
a
start
and
saw
that
golden
had
followed
her
the
poor
child
stood
trembling
in
the
doorway
her
dress
in
disorder
her
beautiful
hair
broken
loose
from
its
fastenings
and
streaming
over
her
shoulders
her
great
blue
eyes
blazing
like
stars
in
her
lovely
pallid
face
her
sweet
lips
curled
in
scorn
as
she
pointed
her
finger
at
leith
and
exclaimed
oh
cruel
unnatural
mother
is
your
life
so
pure
that
you
can
afford
to
sit
in
judgment
on
me
is
the
girl
mad
leith
exclaimed
recoiling
from
her
no
i
am
not
mad
although
my
wrongs
have
been
bitter
enough
to
madden
any
human
being
golden
retorted
passionately
i
am
not
mad
although
your
terrible
sin
has
ruined
my
life
and
broken
my
heart
sin
retorted
leith
in
apparent
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
girl
i
am
nothing
to
you
nothing
to
me
oh
my
god
moaned
golden
wringing
her
white
hands
then
you
deny
that
you
are
my
mother
mother
girl
when
i
have
never
had
a
child
in
my
life
leith
do
you
not
see
that
the
wretched
creature
is
raving
mad
cried
the
lady
retreating
to
his
side
apprehensively
golden
turned
her
flashing
blue
eyes
on
the
white
startled
face
of
the
man
she
denies
that
she
is
my
mother
she
said
perhaps
you
will
deny
that
you
are
my
father
she
saw
a
quiver
pass
over
the
man
pale
face
i
do
not
understand
your
words
he
replied
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
explain
yourself
i
am
the
child
golden
glenalvan
deserted
at
glenalvan
hall
in
its
helpless
infancy
that
she
might
return
to
new
york
and
lead
a
life
of
shame
with
you
she
cried
out
bitterly
richard
leith
dark
eyes
turned
on
her
face
with
a
lurid
gleam
in
their
shadowed
depths
hold
he
cried
whoever
you
are
you
shall
not
malign
the
memory
of
poor
little
golden
she
was
pure
as
the
snow
pure
the
girl
repeated
blankly
she
was
never
your
wife
they
told
me
she
lived
with
you
in
open
shame
a
startling
change
came
over
the
face
of
richard
leith
there
was
a
glare
like
that
of
madness
in
his
eyes
he
fell
backward
into
a
chair
and
the
labored
breath
came
from
between
his
parted
lips
in
strong
shuddering
sighs
leith
flew
to
his
side
and
bent
anxiously
over
him
leith
what
is
it
what
does
all
this
mean
i
am
mystified
she
cried
his
heavy
dark
eyes
full
of
sorrow
and
despair
lifted
gloomily
to
her
wondering
face
it
means
he
replied
that
i
have
had
a
secret
in
my
life
and
that
the
time
is
come
for
you
to
know
it
if
this
girl
speaks
truly
she
is
indeed
my
daughter
though
not
yours
not
hers
echoed
golden
in
bewilderment
as
she
looked
at
the
beautiful
woman
whom
she
had
for
long
weeks
believed
to
be
her
mother
not
hers
he
replied
for
long
before
i
met
and
married
this
lady
little
golden
glenalvan
was
dead
a
startled
cry
came
from
golden
lips
dead
she
shuddered
no
no
you
are
deceiving
me
not
so
as
god
is
my
judge
he
replied
but
sit
down
child
and
tell
me
all
your
story
then
we
may
be
able
to
understand
each
other
golden
glanced
at
leith
who
stood
leaning
against
her
husband
chair
pale
and
silent
and
the
lady
quietly
and
gravely
motioned
her
to
a
seat
she
thankfully
obeyed
the
gesture
for
she
felt
ill
and
weary
and
the
sudden
shock
of
learning
that
her
mother
was
dead
had
been
a
terrible
one
to
her
and
had
almost
stricken
her
senseless
again
in
low
pathetic
tones
and
with
many
tears
golden
told
richard
leith
all
that
she
knew
of
her
mother
and
as
much
as
she
could
of
her
own
lonely
life
without
revealing
the
tragic
story
of
her
unfortunate
love
he
listened
in
silence
although
she
could
see
that
he
was
terribly
agitated
his
white
brow
was
beaded
with
great
drops
of
sweat
his
eyes
stared
wildly
he
bit
his
lips
till
the
blood
started
to
keep
back
the
groans
of
pain
when
she
had
finished
he
went
over
to
her
knelt
at
her
feet
and
gently
kissed
her
cold
little
hand
you
are
my
daughter
he
said
and
you
are
the
living
image
of
your
mother
but
until
this
moment
little
golden
i
believed
you
dead
i
wrote
to
john
glenalvan
when
my
wife
ran
away
from
me
and
asked
him
if
she
had
returned
to
her
father
he
wrote
back
that
she
had
done
so
that
she
had
given
birth
to
a
little
daughter
and
that
the
mother
and
child
had
both
died
then
he
added
his
curse
and
threatened
if
i
ever
came
near
glenalvan
hall
to
shoot
me
down
like
a
dog
his
voice
broke
huskily
a
moment
golden
looked
at
him
eagerly
you
said
your
wife
she
faltered
was
my
mother
then
legally
married
to
you
am
i
not
a
her
voice
broke
huskily
over
the
word
a
nameless
child
your
mother
was
my
legal
wife
little
one
you
are
my
own
daughter
born
in
lawful
wedlock
god
only
knows
what
crafty
and
wicked
enemy
of
mine
wrote
that
lying
letter
to
my
poor
young
wife
telling
her
that
i
had
deceived
her
by
a
mock
marriage
she
was
too
credulous
and
believed
the
lie
too
easily
it
was
not
true
i
can
give
you
every
proof
that
your
mother
was
my
lawful
wife
little
golden
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
with
upraised
hands
and
streaming
eyes
thanked
god
for
those
precious
words
her
mother
had
been
pure
and
noble
there
was
no
shadow
of
stain
on
her
daughter
birth
then
with
a
sudden
startling
thought
she
confronted
him
her
white
hands
clasped
in
agony
her
voice
ringing
wild
and
shrill
john
glenalvan
told
you
that
my
mother
died
he
lied
she
disappeared
very
suddenly
the
night
after
i
was
born
and
that
villain
declared
that
she
had
deserted
me
and
returned
to
her
sinful
life
with
you
she
did
not
die
and
she
did
not
return
to
you
oh
my
god
where
is
she
now
she
saw
that
terrible
question
reflected
on
her
father
face
it
whitened
to
the
awful
hue
of
death
and
he
reeled
backward
like
a
smitten
man
a
faint
cry
came
from
leith
who
had
dropped
heavily
into
a
chair
oh
heaven
if
she
is
yet
living
what
then
am
i
richard
leith
went
to
her
side
and
looked
down
at
her
white
scared
face
pitifully
gertrude
he
said
to
her
gently
we
have
both
been
the
victims
of
a
terrible
wrong
when
i
married
you
several
years
after
the
loss
of
my
first
wife
won
by
your
beauty
which
reminded
me
of
my
poor
little
golden
i
honestly
believed
that
she
was
dead
there
is
some
terrible
mystery
here
and
john
glenalvan
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
i
will
wring
the
truth
from
his
false
lips
and
if
my
lost
little
golden
has
come
to
harm
at
his
hands
his
life
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
his
sin
chapter

oh
father
cried
little
golden
why
did
you
lure
my
poor
mother
from
her
home
she
was
so
young
so
trusting
why
did
you
persuade
her
to
desert
her
parents
the

quivered
all
over
with
vain
remorse
and
penitence
you
do
well
to
reproach
me
little
golden
he
sighed
there
is
no
excuse
for
my
sin
but
i
will
tell
you
how
i
came
to
act
so
imprudently
i
was
a
struggling
young
lawyer
poor
and
proud
when
i
first
met
your
beautiful
mother
during
a
business
trip
to
the
south
her
family
though
reduced
to
comparative
poverty
by
the
late
war
were
proud
and
aristocratic
people
and
i
felt
quite
sure
that
they
would
have
refused
me
the
hand
of
their
petted
darling
i
had
heard
so
much
of
the
pride
of
the
southerners
that
i
was
afraid
to
ask
the
glenalvans
for
their
beautiful
child
so
i
acted
the
part
of
a
coward
and
stole
her
from
them
the
dear
girl
loved
me
well
and
went
with
me
willingly
when
i
promised
to
take
her
back
to
them
after
we
were
married
i
took
her
to
new
york
and
made
her
my
true
and
lawful
wife
but
so
afraid
was
i
of
those
haughty
glenalvans
that
i
refused
to
allow
her
to
write
my
name
and
address
to
her
friends
i
was
waiting
till
i
should
have
acquired
a
fame
and
fortune
that
would
make
me
acceptable
in
their
eyes
oh
god
how
terribly
my
sin
has
found
me
out
after
all
these
years
he
paused
and
wiped
away
the
cold
dew
that
beaded
his
high
white
brow
after
a
moment
he
went
on
sadly
i
was
fast
gaining
prominence
and
a
competence
in
my
profession
when
some
base
enemy
of
mine
as
a
lawyer
i
had
some
of
the
enemies
that
a
man
ever
had
wrote
my
darling
a
letter
defaming
me
in
scandalous
terms
and
averring
that
i
had
deceived
her
by
a
mock
marriage
poor
child
she
was
very
simple
and
credulous
she
fell
an
easy
victim
to
the
liar
tale
she
fled
from
me
leaving
that
cruel
letter
behind
her
the
only
thing
there
was
to
hint
at
the
reason
of
her
hurried
flight
oh
if
only
you
had
followed
her
then
moaned
beautiful
golden
if
i
only
had
he
echoed
my
first
impulse
was
to
do
so
but
i
had
on
hand
a
very
important
case
which
i
had
staked
everything
on
winning
if
i
managed
it
well
my
success
was
assured
as
one
of
the
leading
lawyers
of
the
day
my
speech
for
the
defense
was
anticipated
anxiously
by
many
so
i
suffered
my
ambition
to
overrule
my
first
instinctive
resolve
to
follow
my
wife
and
instead
i
wrote
to
her
brother
he
sent
me
that
lying
letter
that
almost
broke
my
heart
he
broke
down
and
sobbed
like
a
woman
or
rather
unlike
a
woman
for
those
great
convulsive
moans
of
agony
that
issued
from
his
breast
seemed
as
if
they
would
rend
his
heart
in
twain
golden
stole
to
his
side
and
laid
her
small
hand
kindly
on
his
gray
head
that
was
bowed
in
sorrow
and
remorse
i
am
sorry
for
you
my
father
she
said
you
have
been
weak
and
imprudent
but
not
sinful
as
i
thought
but
oh
my
poor
mother
my
heart
is
torn
over
her
wretched
fate
she
must
have
perished
miserably
or
we
should
have
heard
from
her
ere
now
oh
father
what
shall
we
do
they
looked
at
each
other
with
dim
miserable
eyes
this
strangely
reunited
father
and
daughter
the
awful
mystery
of
the
wife
and
mother
fate
chilled
their
hearts
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
gently
nearer
to
him
my
child
i
shall
go
to
glenalvan
hall
and
confront
john
glenalvan
with
his
sin
i
believe
the
whole
key
to
the
mystery
lies
in
that
villain
hands
i
am
almost
sure
of
it
she
replied
he
hated
my
mother
and
he
hated
me
i
will
go
with
you
what
joy
it
will
be
to
stand
up
proudly
before
him
and
tell
him
that
my
birth
was
honest
and
honorable
and
that
my
father
is
a
good
and
true
man
who
is
glad
to
see
me
for
you
glad
are
you
she
asked
him
pleadingly
yes
dear
i
am
very
glad
i
have
always
longed
to
have
a
child
of
my
own
to
love
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
was
always
yearning
for
the
daughter
i
believed
to
be
dead
but
golden
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
pleadingly
as
he
clasped
her
little
hand
you
have
a
story
of
your
own
to
tell
me
before
we
go
on
the
quest
for
your
mother
the
great
mystery
of
love
has
come
to
you
already
in
your
tender
youth
tell
me
my
daughter
are
you
a
wife
the
crimson
color
flushed
into
her
cheeks
then
receded
leaving
her
deathly
pale
again
tears
rose
into
the
great
blue
eyes
and
trembled
on
the
lashes
her
lips
parted
and
closed
again
without
a
sound
tell
me
golden
he
urged
anxiously
are
you
a
wife
or
has
some
artful
villain
deceived
you
if
so
he
clenched
his
hand
and
the
lightnings
of
passion
flashed
from
his
somber
dark
eyes
a
moan
of
pain
came
from
the
girl
white
lips
oh
father
i
can
not
tell
you
now
she
sighed
only
trust
me
do
not
believe
me
vile
and
wicked
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
the
truth
some
day
as
she
spoke
some
strange
new
light
flashed
into
his
mind
she
saw
the
startled
gleam
flash
into
his
eyes
tell
me
he
cried
out
hoarsely
are
you
the
girl
that
was
dismissed
from
desmond
employ
under
the
stigma
of
a
disgraceful
suspicion
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
faltered
yes
in
a
voice
of
agony
was
that
terrible
accusation
true
he
demanded
in
a
voice
so
changed
she
could
scarcely
recognize
it
no
never
it
was
false
i
swear
it
before
heaven
my
trouble
came
to
me
before
i
entered
desmond
employ
she
replied
golden
you
must
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
has
wronged
you
he
said
sternly
i
can
not
she
answered
sorrowfully
you
mean
you
will
not
he
said
i
can
not
i
am
bound
by
a
promise
she
answered
it
was
a
foolish
promise
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
break
it
he
answered
steadily
you
must
clear
yourself
in
desmond
eyes
and
reconcile
her
to
her
husband
do
you
know
that
they
are
separated
on
your
account
i
heard
you
say
so
she
replied
it
is
true
and
i
am
their
lawyer
will
you
let
me
write
to
desmond
and
tell
her
the
name
of
the
man
who
is
really
in
fault
and
for
whose
sin
she
has
deserted
her
innocent
husband
i
can
not
she
moaned
again
in
a
voice
of
agony
i
am
bound
by
a
sacred
promise
bitter
as
the
consequences
are
i
must
keep
it
it
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
this
frail
slight
girl
should
hold
her
secret
so
resolutely
in
the
face
of
the
trouble
it
had
caused
but
golden
think
a
moment
he
began
i
have
thought
until
my
brain
is
almost
wild
she
interrupted
pitifully
but
i
can
see
no
possible
loophole
out
of
my
solemn
vow
of
silence
you
were
wrong
to
take
such
a
vow
golden
and
it
is
almost
wicked
for
you
to
keep
it
do
you
see
how
much
is
at
stake
through
your
silence
a
man
and
his
wife
are
divided
in
anger
and
shame
and
a
cloud
of
the
blackest
disgrace
is
lowering
over
your
own
head
do
you
know
that
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
come
between
husband
and
wife
i
feel
its
enormity
in
the
very
depths
of
my
heart
she
replied
shuddering
and
weeping
then
surely
you
will
speak
you
speak
he
urged
but
she
only
shook
her
head
not
if
i
command
you
to
do
so
he
asked
not
if
you
command
me
she
replied
with
mournful
firmness
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
richard
leith
gazed
upon
the
girl
with
a
sick
and
shuddering
heart
a
vague
suspicion
was
beginning
to
steal
into
his
mind
what
if
golden
was
deceiving
him
and
desmond
belief
were
true
he
reeled
before
the
sickening
horror
of
the
thought
the
dread
suspicion
seemed
to
float
in
fiery
letters
before
his
eyes
he
looked
at
the
bowed
figure
of
the
sobbing
girl
and
steeled
his
heart
against
her
she
was
no
child
of
his
if
she
could
let
the
shadow
of
suspicion
tamely
rest
upon
her
head
golden
he
said
think
of
what
i
must
endure
if
you
refuse
to
declare
yourself
would
you
have
me
acknowledge
a
child
who
has
covered
my
honorable
name
with
shame
shall
i
take
you
by
the
hand
and
say
to
the
world
that
honors
me
as
a
stainless
man
is
my
daughter
she
has
disgraced
herself
and
brought
ruin
and
despair
into
home
she
shrank
and
trembled
before
the
keen
denunciation
of
his
words
she
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
looked
up
with
frightened
imploring
eyes
father
do
not
disown
me
she
cried
i
have
not
disgraced
you
you
will
know
the
truth
some
day
tell
the
whole
world
my
piteous
story
it
may
be
it
may
be
that
the
telling
will
bring
you
joy
not
sorrow
for
she
said
to
her
own
heart
hopefully
if
bertram
chesleigh
should
hear
the
truth
and
know
that
i
am
not
a
nameless
child
surely
he
will
claim
me
then
he
can
no
longer
be
ashamed
of
me
she
felt
that
the
happiness
of
her
whole
future
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
on
the
chance
of
her
father
recognition
of
her
if
in
his
anger
at
her
obstinacy
he
should
repudiate
her
claim
on
him
nothing
was
left
her
but
despair
richard
leith
could
be
as
hard
as
marble
when
he
chose
his
pride
and
his
anger
rose
in
arms
now
against
the
thought
of
receiving
this
branded
girl
as
his
own
daughter
golden
he
said
what
if
i
say
that
i
will
not
receive
you
as
my
daughter
unless
you
consent
to
clear
up
this
disgraceful
mystery
that
surrounds
you
you
will
not
tell
me
so
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
she
cried
fearfully
only
one
word
golden
the
name
of
the
man
who
has
wronged
you
tell
me
that
i
may
punish
him
you
must
not
for
love
she
moaned
despairingly
you
force
me
to
believe
that
desmond
was
right
and
that
you
are
a
lost
and
guilty
creature
he
said
scathingly
a
long
low
wail
came
from
her
lips
then
she
bowed
her
head
and
remained
silent
do
you
still
persist
in
this
obstinate
silence
he
asked
i
must
she
answered
faintly
go
then
he
thundered
at
her
you
are
no
child
of
mine
i
refuse
you
the
shelter
of
my
home
my
name
and
my
heart
i
can
not
believe
that
you
are
the
child
of
my
innocent
little
golden
go
and
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
and
with
the
cruel
words
he
turned
and
left
the
room
chapter
xxxvi
little
golden
stared
at
the
closing
door
through
which
her
father
had
vanished
with
blank
eyes
to
have
found
him
and
lost
him
like
this
was
too
terrible
she
sat
gazing
before
her
like
one
dazed
with
the
angry
words
of
her
father
still
ringing
in
her
ears
when
a
low
and
fluttering
sigh
recalled
her
to
the
fact
of
leith
presence
which
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
in
her
anguish
of
soul
she
looked
around
shrinkingly
at
the
fair
woman
who
had
taken
her
mother
place
and
her
mother
name
dreading
to
meet
a
glance
of
scorn
even
transcending
that
which
her
father
had
cast
upon
her
instead
she
met
the
beautiful
troubled
eyes
of
her
fixed
upon
her
with
tenderest
pity
leith
had
been
vain
careless
and
frivolous
all
her
life
she
had
never
known
a
care
or
sorrow
in
the
whole
course
of
her
pleasant
prosperous
existence
the
hard
crust
of
selfishness
and
indifference
had
grown
over
the
better
impulses
of
a
nature
that
at
the
core
was
true
and
sweet
and
womanly
the
last
hour
with
its
strange
revelations
had
been
the
turning
point
in
her
life
she
realized
with
a
shudder
the
dreadful
position
in
which
she
was
placed
she
was
married
to
a
man
who
in
all
probability
had
a
wife
living
it
was
possible
that
she
herself
was
almost
as
much
an
outcast
as
the
wretched
girl
who
crouched
weeping
on
the
floor
homeless
friendless
and
forsaken
in
the
hour
of
her
direst
need
never
before
had
leith
been
brought
face
to
face
with
a
real
sorrow
she
gazed
wonderingly
upon
poor
little
golden
the
course
of
whose
checkered
life
had
run
as
strangely
as
that
of
one
of
her
favorite
novel
heroines
so
it
happened
that
when
golden
looked
timidly
up
expecting
to
be
immediately
annihilated
by
her
scornful
glance
she
met
only
the
gentlest
pity
beaming
from
the
large
blue
eyes
of
the
unhappy
woman
come
to
me
golden
she
said
and
as
the
young
girl
advanced
she
asked
her
in
a
strangely
saddened
voice
are
you
angry
with
me
child
that
i
have
filled
your
mother
place
and
worn
her
name
for
twelve
long
years
no
i
am
not
angry
golden
answered
gently
it
was
through
no
fault
of
yours
you
did
not
know
no
i
did
not
know
leith
murmured
putting
her
hands
to
her
eyes
while
the
tears
fell
through
her
fingers
i
did
not
know
and
now
it
is
too
late
what
shall
you
do
now
golden
asked
her
wonderingly
i
shall
go
away
leith
replied
sadly
are
you
angry
with
my
father
asked
the
girl
no
golden
he
sinned
ignorantly
replied
leith
therefore
i
can
not
blame
him
but
i
must
go
away
from
him
and
never
see
him
again
until
he
learns
the
truth
whether
or
not
his
first
wife
was
living
when
he
married
me
then
there
was
a
brief
silence
the
two
women
so
lately
mistress
and
maid
now
placed
upon
the
same
level
by
the
equalizing
hand
of
sorrow
sat
still
a
little
while
looking
out
upon
the
unknown
future
with
dreary
hopeless
eyes
then
leith
roused
herself
with
an
effort
and
you
golden
where
will
you
go
what
will
you
do
she
asked
god
knows
the
girl
exclaimed
hopelessly
i
am
so
stunned
by
the
revelations
of
that
i
know
not
where
to
turn
for
weary
months
the
dream
of
finding
and
reclaiming
my
guilty
mother
has
filled
and
occupied
my
thoughts
now
that
i
know
her
innocent
and
pure
the
terrible
mystery
of
her
fate
chills
the
blood
in
my
veins
where
shall
i
look
for
her
how
shall
i
find
her
leith
looked
at
her
compassionately
poor
child
she
said
you
are
too
ill
and
weary
to
seek
for
anyone
now
leave
that
sorrowful
quest
to
your
father
and
place
yourself
in
my
care
the
tears
brimmed
over
in
golden
beautiful
eyes
at
the
kindly
spoken
words
of
her
oh
madam
she
cried
you
offer
to
befriend
me
then
you
do
not
believe
that
i
am
the
lost
and
guilty
creature
they
would
fain
make
me
out
leith
beautiful
face
beamed
with
sympathy
as
she
answered
no
golden
i
do
not
believe
you
are
a
sinner
i
have
a
strong
conviction
that
you
are
a
deserted
or
discarded
wife
and
i
will
care
for
you
in
your
forlorn
situation
with
the
tenderness
of
your
own
mother
chapter

richard
leith
went
down
to
his
office
and
threw
himself
heavily
into
a
chair
bowing
his
gray
head
dejectedly
on
his
hands
his
brain
was
almost
crazed
with
the
agony
of
the
last
hour
discovery
the
sealed
book
of
the
past
had
been
roughly
torn
open
again
and
in
agony
of
soul
he
repented
the
selfish
course
he
had
pursued
with
the
fair
young
wife
he
had
stolen
from
her
home
and
friends
where
was
she
now
his
beautiful
darling
what
fate
had
kept
her
from
her
home
and
friends
and
from
the
little
child
that
had
come
to
such
bitter
grief
in
the
absence
of
the
that
might
have
shielded
her
from
harm
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
impatiently
up
and
down
the
floor
while
he
hurriedly
settled
his
plans
he
would
leave
for
the
south
that
night
he
would
seek
out
john
glenalvan
and
charge
him
with
his
sin
he
would
force
him
to
unfold
the
mystery
of
little
disappearance
perhaps
oh
god
the
villain
had
murdered
her
if
he
had
he
should
suffer
the
dire
punishment
the
law
meted
out
for
such
wretched
criminals
but
before
i
go
he
said
to
himself
grimly
i
will
go
and
see
desmond
if
he
has
lied
to
me
heretofore
woe
be
unto
him
the
base
betrayer
of
my
poor
child
innocence
shall
receive
no
mercy
at
my
hands
he
threw
on
his
hat
and
directed
his
steps
to
the
hotel
where
desmond
was
staying
in
preference
to
the
grand
deserted
dwelling
which
was
closed
and
left
in
the
solitary
care
of
the
housekeeper
during
the
absence
of
the
family
desmond
was
smoking
in
his
luxurious
parlor
carelessly
habited
in
and
slippers
his
handsome
debonair
face
looked
pale
and
worn
and
melancholy
a
hopeful
gleam
came
into
the
listless
eyes
as
his
visitor
was
admitted
ah
leith
so
glad
to
see
you
he
cried
throwing
away
his
cigar
and
eagerly
advancing
you
bring
me
news
edith
has
relented
there
is
nothing
more
unlikely
leith
returned
with
grim
truthfulness
then
he
broke
out
with
fiery
impetuosity
desmond
for
god
sake
tell
me
the
truth
have
you
deceived
me
as
well
as
your
wife
are
you
guilty
of
this
monstrous
sin
desmond
was
startled
by
the
almost
agonizing
entreaty
of
the
lawyer
look
and
voice
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
caught
up
a
small
bible
that
lay
upon
a
table
close
at
hand
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
while
he
exclaimed
in
the
deep
convincing
tones
of
truth
leith
i
solemnly
swear
to
you
that
i
am
innocent
of
the
crime
laid
to
my
charge
so
help
me
god
something
in
the
man
deep
earnestness
and
in
his
look
of
suffering
staggered
richard
leith
doubts
and
fears
and
made
him
feel
that
he
had
been
a
brute
to
doubt
his
daughter
agonized
declarations
of
innocence
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
fervor
and
earnestness
desmond
it
is
but
fair
to
tell
you
that
i
have
found
the
girl
mary
smith
and
that
she
exonerates
you
too
i
was
sure
she
would
although
she
despises
me
cried
desmond
i
admit
that
i
behaved
despicably
to
her
i
tried
to
get
up
a
flirtation
with
her
but
she
scorned
me
with
the
pride
of
a
queen
and
the
affair
went
no
further
i
believed
her
as
pure
and
cold
as
the
snow
no
one
was
more
amazed
than
myself
when
i
learned
the
truth
through
my
causeless
jealousy
you
say
jealousy
desmond
leith
remonstrated
gravely
but
you
forget
that
ever
since
your
marriage
you
have
persistently
wounded
your
loving
and
sensitive
wife
by
the
most
open
and
flagrant
flirtations
thus
giving
her
the
greatest
cause
to
doubt
your
fidelity
desmond
looked
thoroughly
ashamed
and
penitent
at
the
perfectly
truthful
charge
you
speak
the
truth
i
have
behaved
shamefully
he
replied
but
i
have
had
my
lesson
now
i
never
knew
how
much
i
loved
and
honored
my
sweet
and
beautiful
wife
until
in
her
righteous
wrath
she
deserted
me
but
if
she
will
believe
me
this
time
and
return
to
me
i
will
never
offend
her
again
by
my
foolish
propensities
i
will
never
even
look
at
another
woman
i
am
quite
cured
of
flirting
he
spoke
so
soberly
and
earnestly
that
leith
was
fain
to
believe
him
but
he
answered
gravely
your
wife
is
so
thoroughly
incensed
against
you
that
she
will
never
believe
even
your
sworn
word
without
additional
proof
but
how
can
i
prove
it
to
her
cried
the
anxious
husband
she
would
not
believe
mary
smith
denial
and
she
refuses
to
credit
mine
there
is
only
one
way
out
of
the
trouble
the
lawyer
said
gravely
and
that
desmond
asked
anxiously
is
to
find
out
the
man
who
is
really
in
fault
and
obtain
his
sworn
statement
richard
leith
replied
the
girl
will
give
us
the
necessary
information
of
course
desmond
exclaimed
his
spirits
rising
on
the
contrary
she
obstinately
refuses
to
do
so
she
makes
a
most
perplexing
mystery
of
her
unhappy
situation
desmond
looked
uneasy
and
perplexed
a
moment
then
he
exclaimed
confidently
it
is
only
a
question
of
blackmail
then
she
will
tell
the
truth
if
a
golden
bribe
is
offered
her
depend
upon
it
she
is
only
waiting
for
that
you
are
mistaken
richard
leith
returned
gravely
you
do
not
understand
her
motives
i
will
tell
you
a
harrowing
secret
desmond
i
have
discovered
that
that
unfortunate
girl
is
my
own
daughter
in
a
few
eloquent
words
he
told
desmond
the
story
of
his
strange
marriage
and
its
tragic
the
lost
wife
the
ruined
daughter
in
his
own
despair
and
agitation
it
did
not
seem
strange
to
the
lawyer
that
his
excitement
was
reflected
on
the
face
of
his
listener
but
when
he
had
finished
his
story
desmond
sprang
wildly
to
his
feet
exclaiming
good
god
leith
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
the
destroyer
of
your
child
it
is
my
wife
brother
it
is
bertram
chesleigh
heaven
how
blind
i
have
been
richard
leith
exclaimed
with
lurid
eyes
and
a
face
chapter
xxxviii
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
leith
said
huskily
tell
me
how
this
fact
came
to
your
knowledge
desmond
do
you
remember
the
sudden
trip
my
wife
and
i
took
to
florida
last
summer
yes
i
heard
of
it
the
lawyer
replied
i
will
go
back
a
few
months
previous
to
that
trip
desmond
said
it
was
this
winter
a
year
previous
that
bertram
chesleigh
made
the
acquaintance
of
young
frederick
glenalvan
in
new
york
and
was
invited
by
him
to
visit
his
floridian
home
about
the
first
of
last
june
bert
accepted
the
invitation
and
spent
about
two
weeks
at
glenalvan
hall
he
wrote
to
my
wife
from
there
hinting
vaguely
at
having
lost
his
heart
to
a
perfect
of
beauty
edith
who
is
excessively
proud
and
mortally
afraid
of
a
replied
to
him
coolly
discountenancing
the
idea
and
begging
him
not
to
marry
out
of
his
own
state
between
you
and
me
leith
i
believe
she
had
a
great
heiress
booked
for
the
young
fellow
in
new
york
he
paused
for
breath
but
at
richard
leith
look
of
impatience
went
on
hastily
bertram
did
not
reply
to
his
sister
letter
but
in
the
latter
part
of
the
same
month
fred
glenalvan
wrote
us
that
bertram
was
lying
ill
with
brain
fever
we
went
to
him
at
once
and
found
him
not
expected
to
live
he
was
delirious
and
through
all
his
illness
he
called
incessantly
on
one
name
morning
noon
and
night
it
was
always
golden
golden
a
groan
forced
itself
through
richard
leith
rigid
lips
but
he
did
not
speak
and
desmond
continued
that
cry
for
golden
was
always
coupled
with
a
wild
appeal
for
forgiveness
for
some
wrong
the
nature
of
which
we
could
not
determine
my
curiosity
and
that
of
my
wife
were
powerfully
excited
and
we
wondered
who
the
golden
was
that
he
called
upon
and
why
she
never
came
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
glenalvans
did
not
care
to
divulge
the
secret
so
we
never
presumed
to
ask
but
when
bertram
grew
convalescent
edith
inquired
of
him
and
he
told
her
the
truth
let
me
hear
it
said
richard
leith
gaspingly
while
the
knotted
veins
stood
out
like
cords
on
his
forehead
it
was
the
same
story
your
daughter
told
you
that
of
a
fair
young
girl
kept
aloof
from
her
kind
slighted
and
scorned
for
no
visible
fault
bertram
met
and
loved
her
they
had
some
secret
meetings
by
night
in
one
of
which
they
were
discovered
and
in
the
scene
that
followed
the
fact
was
disclosed
that
the
girl
was
illegitimate
oh
my
weakness
my
sin
groaned
the
wretched
listener
curses
upon
john
glenalvan
for
his
horrible
villainy
bertram
declared
that
he
had
only
entertained
the
most
honorable
feelings
toward
the
girl
said
desmond
but
he
confessed
that
the
knowledge
of
her
parentage
so
staggered
him
that
he
was
induced
to
forsake
her
he
left
glenalvan
hall
before
daylight
without
seeing
her
again
the
cowardly
cur
richard
leith
exclaimed
clenching
his
hands
until
the
purple
nails
sunk
into
the
quivering
flesh
hear
me
out
said
desmond
quickly
before
you
judge
him
too
hardly
i
am
listening
answered
richard
leith
trying
to
master
his
surging
passions
beneath
an
appearance
of
calmness
i
am
listening
but
what
more
can
there
be
to
say
mr
desmond
this
leith
bertram
went
away
determined
to
forsake
the
hapless
girl
but
his
love
and
remorse
and
the
overpowering
cause
of
shame
urged
his
return
so
powerfully
that
in
three
days
he
returned
to
glenalvan
hall
with
the
full
intention
of
marrying
the
girl
at
once
and
taking
her
abroad
with
him
where
no
one
knew
her
unfortunate
story
when
he
reached
there
she
was
gone
none
knew
whither
john
glenalvan
told
him
that
she
had
gone
away
with
the
intention
of
leading
a
life
of
sin
with
her
mother
poor
bertram
had
suffered
so
much
that
he
could
not
bear
that
crowning
blow
he
staggered
and
fell
like
a
log
at
the
villain
feet
a
brain
fever
followed
that
nearly
cost
him
his
life
one
more
score
is
added
to
my
terrible
list
against
john
glenalvan
richard
leith
muttered
darkly
i
have
no
more
to
say
continued
desmond
except
that
all
the
circumstances
point
unerringly
at
bertram
chesleigh
as
the
man
who
wronged
your
daughter
you
are
right
groaned
the
unhappy
father
oh
god
if
only
she
had
remained
at
glenalvan
hall
that
he
might
have
made
reparation
for
his
sin
did
not
bertram
write
to
you
in
relation
to
the
unfortunate
affair
he
mentioned
an
intention
to
do
so
said
desmond
only
a
letter
so
cautiously
worded
that
i
could
gain
no
clew
to
the
real
truth
replied
richard
leith
no
names
were
mentioned
he
only
described
the
girl
who
was
supposed
to
have
entered
some
one
of
the
many
nameless
houses
in
this
city
he
wished
me
to
reclaim
her
if
possible
provide
her
a
home
and
he
agreed
to
make
her
a
generous
allowance
poor
bert
said
desmond
and
all
the
while
she
was
in
his
sister
employ
and
in
reach
of
his
hand
if
he
had
only
known
it
there
was
a
moment
heavy
silence
then
richard
leith
rose
hastily
i
must
go
home
now
he
said
i
may
god
forgive
me
i
was
so
maddened
by
my
child
wrongs
and
my
own
suspicions
that
i
refused
to
own
her
i
drove
her
away
from
her
rightful
home
pray
god
that
she
be
not
gone
if
she
has
i
must
bring
her
back
and
tell
her
that
i
know
her
whole
sad
story
and
i
must
make
the
best
i
can
of
her
poor
blighted
life
shall
you
write
to
bertram
chesleigh
inquired
desmond
yes
for
they
must
know
that
they
have
wronged
you
and
that
you
are
innocent
replied
the
lawyer
and
desmond
you
must
write
to
your
wife
i
will
inclose
your
letter
with
mine
otherwise
in
her
pride
and
anger
she
might
return
it
unopened
i
thank
god
that
your
fidelity
is
vindicated
and
that
your
reunion
is
now
insured
i
have
a
better
plan
than
writing
to
her
said
desmond
blushing
like
a
i
will
follow
your
letter
to
her
brother
and
plead
my
cause
in
person
i
can
not
wait
leith
i
am
too
impatient
i
long
to
meet
my
wife
and
child
again
you
will
give
me
their
address
the
sails
i
must
go
with
her
leith
saw
no
objection
to
the
plan
he
was
sorry
for
the
impatient
husband
who
had
received
a
lesson
that
would
last
a
he
gave
him
his
wife
address
in
italy
with
his
cordial
good
wishes
and
went
away
to
seek
his
wronged
unhappy
daughter
she
can
not
have
gone
yet
she
was
to
weak
and
ill
to
have
gone
she
would
have
waited
until
she
was
better
he
kept
whispering
to
his
reproachful
heart
as
he
hurried
along
then
he
thought
of
the
beautiful
fashionable
woman
who
had
taken
the
place
of
little
golden
mother
and
worn
her
name
for
twelve
long
years
poor
gertrude
he
murmured
sadly
i
wonder
how
she
bears
it
perhaps
she
will
not
grieve
much
she
does
not
love
me
as
she
did
when
i
first
made
her
my
wife
perhaps
i
am
to
blame
i
have
chilled
her
tender
nature
by
my
carelessness
or
coldness
for
i
have
never
loved
her
as
i
did
my
lost
little
golden
he
hurried
up
the
marble
steps
and
ran
impatiently
along
the
hall
stumbling
against
the
housekeeper
who
was
pacing
sedately
along
with
a
little
basket
of
keys
as
he
was
rushing
past
her
she
stopped
and
called
to
him
mistress
and
her
maid
are
gone
away
sir
where
he
inquired
pausing
and
looking
back
in
bewildered
surprise
i
can
not
tell
you
for
i
do
not
know
the
woman
replied
respectfully
but
she
bade
me
say
that
she
left
a
letter
for
you
on
her
he
ran
up
to
leith
and
found
it
in
some
slight
disorder
as
if
traveling
bags
had
been
hurriedly
packed
amid
the
dainty
litter
of
the
he
saw
a
square
envelope
addressed
to
himself
and
hurriedly
tore
it
open
his
gaze
ran
over
the
few
pathetic
words
daintily
penciled
on
the
perfumed
satiny
sheet
richard
she
wrote
i
have
gone
away
from
you
i
have
long
felt
that
i
had
but
a
small
share
in
your
heart
and
now
i
know
that
i
have
perhaps
no
right
to
your
name
and
no
place
in
your
home
so
it
is
best
that
i
should
leave
you
i
have
taken
little
golden
with
me
there
is
one
thing
at
least
that
i
can
do
i
can
be
a
mother
to
the
child
whose
father
has
disowned
her
and
whose
mother
is
so
tragically
lost
you
were
wrong
richard
the
child
has
been
wronged
but
i
believe
that
she
is
innocent
i
have
loved
you
more
than
you
knew
perhaps
more
than
you
cared
and
for
your
sake
i
will
care
for
your
forlorn
child
you
will
not
seek
for
us
we
are
companions
in
misery
and
you
will
respect
our
grief
i
can
not
tell
you
where
we
shall
go
but
if
you
find
little
golden
mother
i
shall
know
it
and
the
mother
shall
have
her
child
with
the
simple
name
gertrude
the
letter
ended
richard
leith
reread
it
slowly
filled
with
a
great
surprise
and
wonder
she
will
care
for
the
child
i
treated
so
heartlessly
he
murmured
god
bless
her
i
did
not
know
that
gertrude
could
be
so
true
and
noble
i
have
wronged
her
indeed
and
she
has
worn
the
mask
of
carelessness
and
frivolity
over
a
wounded
heart
oh
god
if
i
only
knew
where
to
find
them
he
almost
cursed
himself
for
his
cruelty
to
his
wronged
and
miserable
daughter
he
remembered
how
young
she
was
and
how
ignorant
of
the
world
when
bertram
chesleigh
had
won
her
heart
perhaps
she
was
not
to
blame
his
wrath
waxed
hot
against
the
man
who
had
betrayed
her
guileless
innocence
he
went
down
and
asked
the
housekeeper
if
leith
had
gone
away
in
the
carriage
and
she
answered
that
the
lady
had
walked
and
the
maid
had
accompanied
her
i
can
not
go
south
until
i
have
found
them
he
said
to
himself
sadly
poor
little
golden
poor
gertrude
before
the
next
day
he
had
visited
every
depot
and
every
wharf
by
which
they
might
have
left
the
city
but
he
had
learned
nothing
the
next
day
after
he
inserted
a
personal
in
the
to
gertrude
return
with
golden
her
true
story
is
known
and
she
is
freely
forgiven
anxiously
but
the
two
for
whom
that
yearning
cry
was

were
fated
never

behold
it

the
dreary
winter
days
came

while
he
waited
for
tidings
filled
with
the
of
a
great
despair
chapter
xxxix
while
the
winter
snow
still
whirled
in
blinding
drifts
through
the
streets
of
new
york
the
sun
shone
the
flowers
bloomed
the
birds
sang
around
old
glenalvan
hall
in
florida
old
dinah
crooned
her
quaint
revival
hymns
in
the
sunny
doorway
of
the
kitchen
and
her
old
master
dozed
in
the
bright
among
the
pots
of
fragrant
flowers
it
was
february
and
hints
of
the
nearing
spring
were
in
the
air
that
sighed
softly
among
the
flowers
and
lifted
the
thin
white
locks
from
the
brow
of
old
hugh
as
his
weary
head
lay
resting
on
the
back
of
his
very
thin
and
sad
and
mournful
looked
the
old
man
as
he
sat
in
his
with
his
lonely
thoughts
fixed
ever
on
the
past
he
was
old
and
weary
life
held
no
charm
for
him
now
one
thought
of
the
last
lonely
sheaf
waiting
for
the
reaper
as
he
sat
with
his
withered
hands
folded
and
that
look
of
patient
grief
on
his
thin
white
aged
face
oh
my
lost
little
golden
he
murmured
aloud
she
tarries
long
the
quest
for
her
mother
is
a
weary
one
oh
that
god
would
give
me
back
the
mother
and
child
both
innocent
and
pure
as
when
i
lost
them
a
sudden
shadow
fell
between
him
and
the
light
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
standing
before
him
a
man
with
a
pale
worn
troubled
face
and
dark
eyes
that
held
the
story
of
a
tragedy
in
their
somber
depths
pardon
he
said
i
have
ventured
unannounced
into
your
presence
my
name
is
richard
leith
the
old
man
stared
at
him
with
dim
unrecognizing
eyes
that
name
conveyed
no
meaning
to
his
mind
he
had
never
heard
it
before
you
are
a
stranger
he
said
yes
richard
leith
answered
and
stood
silent
a
moment
how
should
he
tell
hugh
glenalvan
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
stolen
his
daughter
from
him
and
desolated
his
life
it
was
a
hard
task
his
voice
quivered
and
broke
as
he
said
i
am
a
stranger
but
i
am
also
your
i
have
no
the
old
man
replied
gazing
blankly
at
him
your
daughter
was
my
wife
said
richard
leith
little
golden
said
the
old
man
like
one
dazed
yes
answered
the
lawyer
i
stole
her
from
you
sixteen
years
ago
and
made
her
my
darling
wife
oh
sir
can
you
ever
forgive
me
the
sorrow
i
have
caused
you
a
wife
she
was
a
wife
thank
god
for
that
the
old
man
murmured
with
trembling
delight
and
you
have
brought
her
back
at
last
where
is
she
my
darling
little
golden
oh
god
murmured
the
man
before
him
let
me
see
her
my
sweet
child
cried
hugh
glenalvan
feebly
rising
it
was
cruel
to
keep
the
little
one
from
me
so
long
oh
golden
golden
come
to
me
my
darling
richard
leith
put
him
back
with
gentle
hands
into
his
chair
he
knelt
down
at
his
feet
and
told
him
all
his
sorrowful
story
throwing
all
the
blame
on
himself
and
pleading
humbly
for
pardon
from
the
father
whom
he
had
robbed
of
his
darling
i
loved
her
he
said
she
was
dearer
than
my
own
life
i
would
have
brought
her
back
to
you
in
time
i
was
only
waiting
for
the
fame
and
fortune
that
came
to
me
soon
but
treachery
came
between
us
i
lost
her
and
henceforth
i
have
lived
hand
in
hand
with
sorrow
and
despair
the
soft
wind
sighing
past
the
window
seemed
to
echo
that
heavy
word
despair
at
the
door
of
john
glenalvan
lies
your
sorrow
and
mine
continued
richard
leith
i
am
come
to
call
him
to
account
who
are
you
that
dares
arraign
john
glenalvan
exclaimed
a
harsh
blatant
voice
as
the
speaker
strode
rudely
into
their
presence
richard
leith
sprang
to
his
feet
and
confronted
the
intruder
his
dark
eyes
blazed
with
wrath
as
he
answered
i
am
richard
leith
the
husband
of
golden
glenalvan
whom
you
falsely
reported
dead
to
gain
some
wicked
end
of
your
own
liar
i
have
found
you
out
in
your
sin
i
demand
my
wronged
wife
at
your
hands
john
glenalvan
glared
lividly
at
the
daring
man
who
thus
boldly
confronted
him
with
his
sin
the
blood
retreated
from
his
face
and
lips
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
startled
answer
me
cried
richard
leith
advancing
upon
him
where
is
golden
my
wife
you
lie
she
was
never
your
wife
john
glenalvan
retorted
furiously
shame
upon
you
john
to
malign
the
fair
name
of
your
sister
cried
his
father
indignantly
rather
rejoice
that
she
is
proved
innocent
at
last
let
him
prove
her
so
if
he
can
cried
the
wretch
maliciously
i
can
do
so
here
is
the
certificate
of
my
marriage
to
golden
glenalvan
in
new
york
sixteen
years
ago
replied
richard
leith
unfolding
a
yellowed
paper
and
holding
it
open
before
the
eyes
of
the
father
and
son
then
she
was
really
your
wife
john
said
with
unwilling
belief
of
course
she
was
my
wife
how
dared
you
think
evil
of
your
own
sister
demanded
the
lawyer
scornfully
i
do
not
answer
to
you
for
my
thoughts
sir
replied
john
glenalvan
angrily
but
you
must
answer
to
me
for
the
deed
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
wife
and
child
for
fifteen
years
cried
richard
leith
john
glenalvan
where
is
my
wife
how
should
i
know
he
retorted
it
is
too
late
to
fence
with
me
answered
richard
leith
you
and
you
alone
are
at
the
bottom
of
my
wife
mysterious
disappearance
you
have
either
shut
her
up
in
solitary
confinement
or
you
have
murdered
her
murdered
her
how
dare
you
hint
at
such
a
thing
john
glenalvan
thundered
growing
white
with
fear
i
dare
do
more
cried
the
lawyer
driven
to
desperation
if
you
do
not
tell
me
what
has
become
of
my
wife
i
will
have
you
arrested
for
her
murder
at
these
warning
words
john
glenalvan
threw
himself
upon
his
accuser
with
the
cry
of
an
infuriated
wild
beast
richard
leith
was
weak
and
ill
he
had
risen
from
a
on
which
wasting
anxiety
and
grief
had
thrown
him
when
he
came
to
glenalvan
hall
he
went
down
like
an
infant
before
the
strong
fury
of
his
opponent
and
the
old
man
wailing
cry
pierced
the
air
john
hold
your
hand
for
god
sake
do
not
murder
the
man
chapter
xl
john
glenalvan
did
not
heed
his
father
frightened
remonstrance
he
continued
to
rain
furious
blows
on
his
feeble
but
struggling
foe
the
fell
instinct
of
murder
was
aroused
within
his
soul
and
richard
leith
would
have
fallen
a
sure
victim
to
its
fury
but
that
suddenly
the
slight
form
of
a
woman
rushed
into
the
room
and
with
a
wild
and
piercing
shriek
sprang
upon
john
glenalvan
neck
clutching
it
with
frantic
fingers
in
the
endeavor
to
tear
him
from
his
almost
dying
victim
almost
strangling
in
the
fierce
tenacity
of
her
grasp
the
wretch
released
leith
and
springing
upward
with
a
savage
bound
threw
his
frail
assailant
from
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
terrible
shock
hurled
her
prostrate
on
the
floor
she
lay
there
stunned
and
bleeding
and
the
wretch
after
one
glance
at
her
rushed
from
the
room
golden
it
is
golden
and
he
has
killed
her
wailed
her
grandfather
falling
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
richard
leith
where
he
lay
half
dying
comprehended
the
anguished
wail
and
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
the
side
of
his
hapless
daughter
it
was
little
golden
indeed
but
she
lay
still
and
silent
with
the
blood
oozing
from
her
nostrils
and
a
slight
cut
on
her
temple
as
he
reached
her
side
old
dinah
rushed
into
the
room
little
missie
little
missie
she
cried
then
she
stopped
short
in
terror
oh
my
hebenly
master
who
has
done
dis
dinah
her
master
said
quickly
go
and
send
fred
glenalvan
to
me
she
hobbled
out
obediently
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
the
handsome
young
dandy
who
glanced
at
his
grandfather
with
haughty
indifference
fredrick
the
old
man
said
with
strange
sternness
here
are
two
people
whom
your
father
has
nearly
killed
you
must
go
and
bring
a
doctor
for
them
frederick
started
at
the
sight
of
the
bleeding
forms
upon
the
floor
but
in
an
instant
his
countenance
hardened
into
marble
if
my
father
has
hurt
them
he
replied
i
doubt
not
that
he
had
good
reason
for
doing
so
and
they
may
die
before
i
will
fetch
a
physician
to
them
with
that
insolent
reply
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
vipers
muttered
the
old
man
indignantly
then
he
looked
at
dinah
sadly
my
faithful
old
soul
he
said
you
must
do
what
you
can
for
them
i
must
go
and
seek
for
help
myself
he
went
feebly
from
the
room
and
across
the
lawn
outside
the
gates
he
encountered
a
carriage
waiting
the
driver
stood
on
the
ground
by
the
horses
heads
and
a
lady
sat
on
the
satin
cushions
with
a
troubled
look
on
her
lovely
blond
face
she
sprang
out
impulsively
and
came
up
to
him
oh
sir
she
cried
i
you
are
glenalvan
have
you
seen
little
golden
she
went
into
the
hall
a
few
minutes
ago
i
have
seen
her
i
fear
she
is
dead
and
i
must
bring
a
doctor
the
old
man
wailed
she
caught
his
arm
and
turned
to
the
driver
drive
into
town
at
your
highest
speed
and
fetch
a
physician
she
said
throwing
her
purse
at
his
feet
then
she
took
the
old
man
arm
and
hurried
him
in
i
am
your
little
golden
friend
she
explained
to
him
as
they
went
along
i
came
here
with
her
and
was
waiting
outside
while
she
paid
you
a
visit
old
dinah
was
bathing
the
wound
of
her
unconscious
mistress
when
they
entered
and
richard
leith
lay
upon
the
floor
watching
her
with
dim
despairing
eyes
oh
heaven
who
has
done
this
terrible
deed
leith
cried
wildly
as
her
eyes
took
in
the
dreadful
scene
gertrude
her
husband
cried
out
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
she
knelt
down
by
him
weeping
wildly
oh
richard
who
is
it
that
has
killed
you
and
your
child
she
sobbed
in
anguish
it
is
john
glenalvan
dreadful
work
he
replied
then
he
looked
into
her
face
with
dim
yearning
eyes
gertrude
i
believe
i
am
dying
he
said
faintly
will
you
forgive
me
before
i
die
forgive
you
she
said
ah
richard
do
not
think
that
i
blamed
you
you
sinned
ignorantly
yes
ignorantly
he
echoed
and
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
an
instant
then
he
said
sadly
but
i
did
not
mean
gertrude
i
meant
you
must
forgive
me
that
i
was
careless
and
blind
that
i
did
not
prize
your
true
heart
more
she
put
her
white
hand
to
her
heart
and
a
look
of
pain
came
into
the
large
blue
eyes
then
she
said
with
mournful
pathos
for
all
the
heartaches
i
have
borne
richard
i
freely
forgive
you
thank
you
he
murmured
then
his
eyes
dwelt
on
her
gratefully
it
was
so
noble
in
you
to
care
for
my
poor
child
he
murmured
but
gertrude
i
repented
in
an
hour
i
came
back
to
tell
her
so
and
she
was
gone
both
were
gone
i
sought
you
everywhere
my
heart
nearly
broke
i
fell
ill
and
lay
for
weary
weeks
fevered
and
maddened
by
my
impatience
and
anxiety
at
last
i
grew
better
and
came
here
have
you
found
she
murmured
anxiously
while
the
red
blood
suffused
her
fair
cheeks
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
his
eyes
closed
languidly
she
believed
that
he
was
dead
and
started
up
with
a
cry
of
woe
but
when
the
physician
came
a
little
later
he
decided
that
he
was
only
in
a
deep
swoon
golden
recovered
consciousness
and
the
hapless
father
and
daughter
were
removed
to
adjoining
rooms
the
physician
veering
anxiously
from
one
room
to
another
he
believed
that
leith
life
might
be
saved
by
his
medical
skill
but
he
shook
his
head
ominously
over
the
beautiful
child
whose
shrill
wails
of
agony
pierced
every
heart
for
in
the
agitation
of
her
mind
and
the
fearful
shock
of
her
heavy
fall
the
pangs
of
premature
motherhood
had
came
upon
her
john
glenalvan
had
fled
from
the
scene
of
his
villainy
with
a
speed
to
which
sudden
fear
and
remorse
had
lent
wings
he
believed
that
he
had
killed
richard
leith
and
his
unfortunate
child
and
in
the
fear
of
punishment
for
his
crime
he
did
not
even
stop
to
apprise
his
family
of
what
had
occurred
but
hurried
away
to
seek
a
for
himself
too
late
he
regretted
the
blind
rage
that
had
forced
him
into
the
commission
of
such
a
desperate
deed
the
cries
of
his
victims
seemed
to
pursue
him
in
his
hurried
flight
his
son
reported
his
cowardly
deeds
to
his
mother
and
sister
and
they
remained
lost
in
fear
and
wonder
to
do
them
justice
wicked
as
they
were
they
had
no
idea
of
the
enormity
of
john
glenalvan
sin
they
honestly
believed
that
his
sister
golden
had
disgraced
the
family
they
dreamed
not
of
the
dread
secret
locked
in
his
breast
clare
made
a
stealthy
tour
of
discovery
into
the
western
wing
and
soon
finding
out
how
matters
stood
returned
to
her
mother
in
a
frenzy
of
wrath
and
anger
against
her
hapless
cousin
little
golden
oh
mother
such
dreadful
goings
on
she
said
that
shameless
girl
sick
in
one
room
a
strange
man
dead
in
another
and
a
doctor
and
old
dinah
and
a
strange
woman
tending
them
if
i
were
you
mother
i
really
should
not
stand
it
i
would
turn
the
whole
tribe
out
of
doors
should
not
you
fred
but
frederick
who
despite
his
defiant
manner
to
his
grandfather
looked
pale
and
uneasy
vetoed
the
proposition
as
imprudent
i
do
not
know
what
provocation
my
father
had
to
maltreat
them
so
he
said
but
certainly
they
have
a
bad
case
against
him
and
if
the
man
is
dead
as
you
say
clare
and
if
our
cousin
dies
too
they
can
indict
him
for
murder
glenalvan
and
her
daughter
were
so
frightened
at
that
grim
word
murder
that
they
broke
into
hysterical
tears
and
sobbing
while
the
hopeful
son
and
heir
sat
silent
overwhelmed
by
the
dread
of
evil
that
had
fallen
upon
them
all
to
which
was
added
the
terrors
of
doubt
and
suspense
that
strange
man
and
woman
who
can
they
be
fred
inquired
his
mother
i
can
not
tell
but
i
have
my
suspicions
he
replied
i
believe
they
are
the
parents
of
golden
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
papa
was
goaded
into
attempting
murder
cried
clare
only
think
of
the
impudence
of
our
wicked
aunt
in
coming
back
to
glanalvan
hall
i
should
think
father
must
have
been
maddened
at
the
very
sight
and
yet
mother
she
is
one
of
the
fairest
women
i
ever
saw
she
does
not
look
like
a
lost
woman
she
has
a
very
innocent
appearance
there
were
others
beside
these
three
who
wondered
over
the
beautiful
strange
woman
who
claimed
to
be
little
golden
friend
old
dinah
and
her
master
gazed
upon
her
wonderful
beauty
which
reminded
them
so
powerfully
of
the
missing
golden
and
they
wondered
what
her
name
could
be
old
dinah
asked
her
at
last
what
she
should
call
her
and
she
answered
simply
though
with
a
burning
blush
my
name
is
gertrude
or
miss
asked
the
inquisitive
old
negress
and
again
the
face
grew
crimson
as
she
answered
they
must
not
know
that
i
was
his
wife
she
said
to
herself
resolutely
i
could
not
bear
to
have
them
know
it
perhaps
they
would
hate
me
and
judge
him
unjustly
but
her
tears
fell
heavily
as
she
looked
at
the
deathly
white
face
laying
on
the
pillow
and
she
wondered
to
herself
if
it
would
not
be
less
hard
for
her
to
see
him
die
then
and
there
than
live
to
find
his
lost
wife
again
god
forgive
me
for
my
weakness
and
selfishness
she
cried
starting
at
her
own
thoughts
may
he
live
to
find
the
happiness
of
which
he
has
been
cheated
so
long
the
long
weary
night
filled
with
mortal
agony
to
poor
little
golden
slowly
wore
away
at
the
earliest
peep
of
dawn
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
town
with
a
telegram
for
leith
he
lay
barely
conscious
on
his
pillow
breathing
heavily
and
slow
and
the
physician
read
the
message
to
him
cautiously
it
was
from
desmond
and
ran
briefly
we
arrived
in
new
york
this
hour
is
golden
with
you
bertram
is
with
anxiety
and
across
the
lightning
wires
the
fatal
message
flashed
back
to
their
anxious
hearts
is
here
her
child
is
dead
and
she
is
dying
this
was
the
end
of
that
brief
dream
of
love
those
weary
months
of
supreme
whiter
than
the
pillow
on
which
she
lay
beautiful
golden
was
breathing
her
sad
young
life
out
in
heavy
sighs
and
moans
while
hidden
carefully
out
of
sight
beneath
its
white
linen
sheet
there
lay
the
sweet
little
baby
that
never
had
drawn
a
breath
chapter
xli
into
that
splendid
home
in
new
york
where
the
desmonds
had
just
arrived
from
europe
that
terrible
telegram
came
like
a
bertram
chesleigh
repentant
soul
reeled
in
agony
before
it
i
am
justly
punished
for
my
cowardly
desertion
of
my
darling
he
groaned
to
his
sister
to
whom
he
had
confided
his
sorrowful
secret
but
oh
god
how
terribly
i
have
suffered
for
the
weakness
and
folly
of
an
hour
edith
whose
heart
had
been
strangely
changed
and
softened
since
her
reconciliation
with
her
husband
wept
with
him
over
the
dreadful
news
bertram
we
must
go
to
her
she
said
in
death
if
not
in
life
we
must
lift
the
shadow
from
the
poor
girl
memory
elinor
glenalvan
is
going
home
shall
we
accompany
her
yes
but
do
not
tell
her
why
we
go
she
hated
my
poor
little
golden
he
answered
sighing
heavily
elinor
wondered
secretly
over
their
going
but
rejoiced
also
she
had
gone
abroad
with
them
had
had
a
most
delightful
time
and
she
sighed
to
think
that
the
end
had
come
at
last
but
one
thing
grieved
her
most
of
all
all
her
arts
and
her
beauty
added
to
desmond
influence
had
failed
to
win
bertram
chesleigh
she
almost
hated
him
when
she
thought
of
going
home
to
hear
her
mother
lamentations
over
her
failure
and
her
sister
taunts
her
spirits
rose
at
the
welcome
news
that
he
was
going
south
with
her
perhaps
she
might
triumph
yet
it
was
a
hopeful
augury
that
he
was
not
willing
to
lose
sight
of
her
yet
poor
vain
and
artful
elinor
she
did
not
dream
of
the
real
truth
she
believed
that
golden
had
been
thrust
out
of
her
way
forever
strangely
enough
though
she
had
known
the
true
cause
of
the
separation
she
had
never
been
able
to
ferret
out
the
reason
of
their
reconciliation
immediately
after
desmond
reached
italy
his
wife
had
summarily
dismissed
celine
no
hints
nor
careless
appearance
of
wonder
on
elinor
part
could
elicit
the
reason
for
the
maid
dismissal
she
only
knew
that
the
frenchwoman
had
gone
away
in
insolent
triumph
taking
with
her
the
money
she
had
wrested
from
her
in
payment
for
her
treachery
to
poor
little
golden
desmond
generous
impulse
to
accompany
her
brother
was
frustrated
by
the
sudden
illness
of
her
little
daughter
so
bertram
was
forced
to
go
on
his
sad
mission
without
her
and
elinor
was
jubilant
over
the
prospect
of
a
long
delightful
trip
under
his
exclusive
care
anticipation
and
reality
are
different
things
however
as
elinor
was
fated
to
learn
never
was
there
a
more
gloomy
or
cavalier
than
the
handsome
and
entertaining
chesleigh
on
this
occasion
elinor
bit
her
ruby
lip
and
looked
daggers
as
he
lounged
in
his
seat
pretending
to
be
absorbed
in
a
newspaper
but
with
lips
compressed
beneath
his
dark
mustache
and
a
strange
somber
light
in
the
large
black
eyes
that
puzzled
elinor
who
had
not
the
key
to
his
mood
indeed
she
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
vague
feeling
of
dread
and
anxiety
she
asked
herself
over
and
over
why
he
had
chosen
to
bear
her
company
on
her
homeward
way
evidently
it
was
through
no
tenderness
for
her
though
scrupulously
polite
and
attentive
he
preserved
the
appearance
of
distant
friendliness
in
too
marked
a
fashion
to
be
misinterpreted
when
at
last
after
traveling
without
delay
or
rest
they
found
themselves
seated
in
the
carriage
that
was
to
convey
them
to
glenalvan
hall
elinor
felt
a
certain
sense
of
relief
mingled
with
her
chagrin
and
disappointment
she
loved
bertram
chesleigh
but
his
moodiness
and
silence
were
strangely
oppressive
why
did
he
come
with
me
she
asked
herself
for
the
last
time
as
the
carriage
rolled
along
the
breezy
wooded
drive
and
her
strange
companion
lay
back
among
the
cushions
his
hat
tilted
over
his
eyes
his
face
pale
his
lips
working
convulsively
what
will
clare
say
when
she
sees
how
disdainfully
he
treats
me
how
she
will
triumph
at
my
disappointment
her
heart
sank
at
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
quietude
and
dreariness
of
glenalvan
hall
after
the
gay
easy
luxurious
life
she
had
led
for
the
last
few
months
for
a
moment
her
love
for
the
indifferent
man
beside
her
was
transformed
to
hate
why
had
he
slighted
her
beauty
and
her
fascinations
to
turn
to
that
child
whose
life
was
a
disgrace
to
the
glenalvans
she
hated
bertram
chesleigh
because
he
had
not
rescued
her
from
the
poverty
of
which
she
had
grown
so
weary
and
from
which
his
love
might
have
delivered
her
at
least
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
removed
that
little
vixen
golden
from
his
pathway
she
thought
with
vindictive
triumph
if
she
had
remained
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
i
should
like
to
know
what
became
of
her
when
she
left
desmond
i
sincerely
hope
she
drowned
herself
in
the
sea
the
carriage
turned
a
sudden
bend
in
the
road
and
elinor
leaning
idly
forward
to
note
the
old
familiar
landmarks
gazed
intently
one
moment
then
uttered
a
stifled
cry
of
terror
bertram
chesleigh
started
like
one
awaking
from
a
dream
what
is
it
has
anything
alarmed
you
miss
glenalvan
he
inquired
courteously
look
there
she
cried
fearfully
pointing
her
hand
through
the
window
he
followed
the
direction
of
her
finger
and
saw
oh
horror
that
they
were
passing
the
of
the
glenalvans
he
saw
a
little
band
of
mourners
grouped
around
a
narrow
mound
of
earth
he
saw
the
minister
standing
at
the
head
of
the
grave
with
his
open
book
and
fancied
he
could
hear
him
repeating
the
solemn
beautiful
words
with
which
we
consign
ashes
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
pray
tell
the
driver
to
stop
elinor
cried
out
excitedly
i
must
get
out
someone
of
my
own
family
must
be
dead
he
made
no
answer
he
was
handing
her
out
with
hands
that
trembled
as
nervously
as
her
own
one
terrible
blasting
thought
was
in
his
mind
it
is
golden
my
wronged
little
wife
and
my
babe
that
i
never
saw
whom
they
are
hiding
beneath
that
little
mound
he
said
to
himself
in
agony
oh
god
that
i
should
have
come
only
in
time
for
this
he
opened
the
little
white
gate
that
led
into
the
green
with
its
glimmering
white
stones
and
elinor
silently
followed
him
the
little
group
about
the
grave
fell
back
as
they
approached
and
they
saw
the
men
throwing
up
the
earth
upon
the
grave
its
dull
awful
thud
fell
like
the
crash
of
a
great
despair
upon
his
heart
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
murmured
the
minister
solemn
voice
and
the
man
fell
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hand
afraid
and
ashamed
for
that
deep
voice
seemed
to
condemn
him
for
the
evil
he
had
wrought
a
weak
and
trembling
hand
fluttered
down
on
his
shoulder
and
a
thin
quavering
voice
sounded
reproachfully
in
his
ear
so
you
have
come
to
exhult
over
your
wicked
work
bertram
chesleigh
the
wretched
man
looked
up
into
the
streaming
eyes
of
old
hugh
glenalvan
at
a
little
distance
he
saw
old
black
dinah
regarding
him
with
looks
of
horror
and
loathing
a
beautiful
woman
stood
apart
weeping
silently
and
elinor
glenalvan
had
gone
to
the
minister
and
was
speaking
to
him
agitatedly
bertram
sprang
up
desperately
oh
sir
for
god
sake
he
cried
to
the
dejected
old
man
tell
me
whom
they
have
buried
here
and
the
answer
came
in
broken
tones
golden
glenalvan
and
her
babe
bertram
chesleigh
kneeling
in
the
dust
that
was
heaped
above
the
dead
heart
that
had
loved
him
so
devotedly
lifted
his
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
and
cried
out
in
a
broken
contrite
voice
i
call
god
to
witness
that
it
is
golden
chesleigh
not
golden
glenalvan
you
have
buried
here
this
dead
girl
was
my
wife
made
so
by
a
secret
marriage
last
summer
it
is
my
wife
and
my
child
you
have
hidden
from
me
in
this
low
grave
may
god
forgive
me
for
the
wrong
i
did
them
then
unable
to
bear
the
strain
upon
his
nerves
and
his
heart
any
longer
the
wretched
man
fell
forward
heavily
and
lay
in
a
deep
swoon
across
the
mound
that
covered
little
golden
and
her
child
a
terrible
punishment
had
been
meted
out
to
him
for
the
pride
and
selfishness
that
had
made
of
his
innocent
an
outcast
and
a
creature
at
whom
to
point
the
finger
of
a
seemingly
just
scorn
the
deathless
flame
of
that
deep
remorse
that
spurns
power
had
been
kindled
in
his
heart
never
to
go
out
save
with
the
breath
of
life
chapter
xlii
for
a
few
moments
all
believed
that
bertram
chesleigh
was
dead
elinor
glenalvan
filled
with
astonishment
and
deadly
rage
devoutly
hoped
that
he
was
her
love
had
turned
to
hate
and
as
by
a
sudden
flash
she
understood
fully
the
passion
of
remorse
and
despair
that
had
brought
him
to
glenalvan
hall
the
vindictive
wish
came
over
her
that
he
had
died
before
he
had
spoken
the
brave
words
that
had
cleared
the
stain
from
the
memory
of
the
girl
she
had
hated
with
such
jealous
fire
and
passion
she
had
yet
to
learn
that
every
shadow
had
been
cleared
from
golden
name
while
she
stood
like
a
statue
and
angrily
regarded
the
striking
scene
the
others
busied
themselves
with
the
restoration
of
the
unconscious
man
dinah
brought
cold
water
from
a
little
spring
and
bathed
his
face
and
hands
gertrude
held
her
to
his
nose
in
a
short
time
he
revived
and
looked
about
him
with
an
agony
of
sorrow
in
his
pale
drawn
face
his
first
conscious
thought
was
of
his
loved
and
wife
she
is
dead
he
groaned
i
shall
never
hear
her
sweet
lips
pronounce
my
pardon
oh
god
did
she
leave
me
no
message
did
she
not
curse
me
in
dying
for
the
woe
i
had
wrought
they
all
stood
aloof
from
him
except
gertrude
she
told
him
what
he
asked
in
a
grave
and
gentle
voice
she
made
no
mention
of
you
chesleigh
she
was
patient
and
brave
to
the
last
she
kept
her
vow
of
silence
to
the
bitter
end
and
died
with
the
story
of
her
innocence
untold
i
coward
that
i
was
bound
her
to
secrecy
he
said
but
i
did
not
dream
then
of
what
would
happen
after
i
wish
to
god
that
she
had
spoken
and
vindicated
her
honor
and
again
an
expression
of
the
deepest
sorrow
convulsed
the
dark
handsome
face
she
was
too
true
and
loyal
to
break
her
vow
answered
gertrude
tearfully
i
believe
that
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
it
all
killed
her
she
was
a
martyr
to
her
love
he
groaned
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
folded
arms
there
was
silence
and
every
eye
but
elinor
rested
tearfully
upon
the
low
mound
beneath
which
slumbered
the
poor
girl
who
had
died
with
the
brand
of
the
erring
upon
her
but
who
in
this
hour
was
proven
guiltless
and
pure
as
gertrude
had
said
a
patient
martyr
to
affection
oh
that
i
might
have
seen
her
even
once
groaned
bertram
chesleigh
turning
instinctively
for
comfort
to
the
sweet
sympathetic
face
of
gertrude
oh
tell
me
did
she
suffer
in
dying
was
she
conscious
she
shook
her
head
no
she
passed
from
a
quiet
slumber
into
death
the
change
was
so
gradual
we
scarcely
knew
when
she
was
gone
gone
the
word
thrilled
him
with
a
keen
and
bitter
pain
the
sweet
he
had
loved
so
dearly
was
lost
from
his
life
forever
she
was
gone
from
a
world
that
had
used
her
harshly
and
coldly
to
take
her
fitting
place
among
the
angels
the
soft
wind
sighing
through
the
trees
and
the
grass
seemed
to
murmur
her
requiem
in
he
rose
and
stood
among
them
his
heavy
eyes
turning
to
the
sad
old
face
of
the
grandfather
whom
he
had
bereaved
of
his
darling
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
humbly
is
gone
from
us
and
i
can
not
sue
for
her
pardon
he
said
wistfully
but
will
you
not
forgive
me
sir
for
the
sorrow
my
weakness
and
pride
brought
upon
her
and
you
but
old
hugh
glenalvan
kindly
blue
eyes
flashed
upon
him
with
a
gleam
of
their
youthful
fire
and
his
voice
quivered
with
anger
and
despair
as
he
replied
i
will
never
forgive
you
unless
should
rise
from
the
grave
and
forgive
you
too
ye
must
forgive
as
ye
would
be
forgiven
said
the
gentle
admonitory
voice
of
the
man
of
god
but
the
indignant
old
man
shook
off
his
suppliant
hand
she
was
his
wife
and
he
discarded
and
deserted
her
there
is
no
forgiveness
for
such
a
sin
he
said
with
fiery
scorn
as
he
turned
away
they
went
away
and
left
bertram
alone
with
the
wronged
and
quiet
dead
gertrude
in
her
gentle
womanly
pity
would
fain
have
persuaded
him
to
go
home
with
them
but
he
refused
to
listen
leave
me
to
my
lonely
vigil
here
he
said
sorrowfully
if
her
gentle
spirit
is
yet
hovering
about
she
may
accept
my
bitter
grief
and
repentance
as
some
atonement
when
they
had
all
gone
and
left
him
he
bowed
his
head
with
a
bitter
cry
oh
golden
my
lost
little
darling
only
six
feet
of
earth
between
us
and
yet
i
shall
never
see
you
speak
to
you
nor
hear
you
again
a
low
respectful
cough
interrupted
the
mournful
tenor
of
his
thoughts
he
glanced
up
and
saw
the
old
leaning
on
his
spade
and
regarding
him
wistfully
what
are
you
waiting
for
my
man
he
inquired
feeling
impatient
at
this
seeming
intrusion
on
his
grief
if
you
please
sir
i
have
not
yet
finished
throwing
up
the
earth
and
shaping
the
mound
said
the
man
with
some
embarrassment
a
bitter
cry
came
from
bertram
chesleigh
lips
what
would
you
bury
her
still
deeper
from
my
sight
he
cried
oh
rather
throw
off
this
heavy
covering
of
earth
and
suffer
me
to
look
upon
my
darling
one
again
the
man
stared
at
him
half
fearfully
oh
sir
your
sorrow
has
almost
crazed
you
he
said
you
had
better
return
to
your
friends
and
leave
me
here
to
finish
my
necessary
work
but
a
new
thought
born
of
his
grief
and
remorse
had
come
into
the
mind
of
the
mourner
my
man
look
at
me
he
said
earnestly
i
want
you
to
open
this
grave
and
let
me
see
my
wife
again
you
can
not
refuse
me
when
i
pray
you
to
do
it
only
think
they
have
buried
my
child
and
i

kiss
the
babe
and
its
mother
once
i
can
not
go
away
until
i
have
done
so
oh

you
are
going
mad
the
man
cried
alarmed
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing

could
not
do
it
if
i
would
i
could
not
take
the
coffin
out
alone

me
help

said
the
distracted
mourner
what
you
wish
is
quite
impossible
sir
faltered
the
man
anxiously
let
me
beg
you
to
go
on
to
the
hall
and
leave
me
to
finish
my
sad
duty
you
must
not
refuse
me
it
will
break
my
heart
bertram
chesleigh
cried
i
will
pay
you
well
see
he
drew
out
a
handful
of
shining
gold
pieces
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
will
show
me
the
faces
of
my
wife
and
child
the
dull
eyes
of
the
grew
bright
at
that
sight
he
was
poor
and
a
hundred
dollars
were
wealth
to
him
i
am
sorry
for
you
sir
i
wish
i
could
do
what
you
wish
that
money
would
do
my
poor
wife
and
children
a
deal
of
good
if
you
could
wait
until
night
he
said
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
significantly
around
him
i
might
get
help
and
do
the
job
for
you
some
whispered
words
passed
between
them
then
bertram
chesleigh
rose
and
passed
out
of
the
green
graveyard
casting
one
yearning
look
behind
him
at
the
low
grave
that
held
his
darling
he
bent
his
lagging
footsteps
toward
old
glenalvan
hall
whose
towers
glistened
picturesquely
in
the
evening
sunshine
bertram
went
in
through
the
wide
entrance
and
crossing
the
level
lawn
walked
along
the
border
of
the
beautiful
lake
it
was
here
that
we
parted
he
murmured
to
himself
in
his
sorrowful
retrospection
how
beautiful
how
happy
she
was
how
full
of
love
and
trust
oh
god
what
dark
spell
came
over
me
and
made
me
for
terrible
hours
false
to
my
love
and
my
vows
that
old
man
was
right
there
is
no
forgiveness
for
such
a
terrible
sin
frederick
glenalvan
saw
him
from
the
house
and
came
down
to
meet
him
chesleigh
i
have
heard
all
he
said
with
pretended
sympathy
elinor
told
us
my
dear
friend
how
sorry
i
am
for
you
i
was
about
to
go
and
seek
you
you
must
come
up
to
the
house
and
take
some
refreshment
you
look
ready
to
drop
i
feel
fearfully
ill
said
chesleigh
staggering
unsteadily
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
i
need
something
but
do
not
ask
me
to
accept
the
shelter
of
your
roof
fred
i
have
a
quarrel
with
your
father
he
has
bitterly
deceived
me
and
must
answer
to
me
for
his
sin
father
is
not
at
home
he
has
been
absent
for
several
days
said
fred
confusedly
but
if
you
will
not
come
up
to
the
hall
sit
down
here
on
this
bench
and
i
will
bring
you
some
wine
bertram
obeyed
his
request
almost
mechanically
his
head
ached
and
he
felt
dull
lifeless
and
inert
the
grief
and
excitement
under
which
he
had
labored
for
several
days
were
beginning
to
tell
heavily
upon
his
overstrained
nerves
with
the
murmured
name
of
golden
his
head
drooped
on
his
breast
and
he
relapsed
into
he
was
aroused
by
a
hand
lifting
his
head
and
starting
into
consciousness
saw
frederick
glenalvan
by
his
side
and
elinor
standing
before
him
with
a
small
tray
on
which
were
arranged
a
glass
of
wine
and
several
slices
of
cake
he
did
not
notice
how
white
and
strange
she
looked
nor
how
steely
her
voice
sounded
as
she
said
you
are
faint
and
ill
drink
this
it
will
revive
you
she
put
the
wine
to
his
lips
and
he
drank
it
thirstily
a
fire
seemed
to
run
through
his
veins
new
life
came
into
his
limbs
he
arose
and
thanked
her
but
refused
the
cake
i
am
better
but
i
can
not
eat
it
would
choke
me
he
said
and
elinor
did
not
press
him
she
turned
away
and
as
she
passed
the
lake
she
furtively
tossed
the
in
and
the
cake
after
it
so
father
had
deceived
him
and
must
answer
to
him
for
his
sin
she
said
to
herself
bitterly
as
she
walked
along
well
well
we
shall
see
oh
how
i
hate
him
yet
once
i
loved
him
and
hoped
to
be
his
wife
i
might
have
been
if
that
little
jade
had
never
come
between
oh
how
i
hate
her
even
in
her
grave
she
went
back
to
the
hall
walking
like
one
in
a
dream
with
lurid
blazing
eyes
and
a
face
blanched
to
the
pallor
of
a
marble
image
muttering
wickedly
to
herself
chapter
xliii
when
elinor
had
gone
frederick
glenalvan
turned
curiously
to
chesleigh
so
you
were
really
the
husband
of
golden
leith
and
not
her
betrayer
as
everybody
believed
he
said
yes
she
was
my
lawful
wife
but
why
do
you
call
her
golden
leith
bertram
chesleigh
inquired
curiously
did
you
not
know
said
fred
carelessly
that
she
had
found
her
father
he
is
a
new
york
lawyer
and
his
name
is
richard
leith
it
seems
that
her
mother
was
really
married
to
him
after
all
thank
god
then
there
is
really
not
a
shadow
of
disgrace
upon
my
poor
wronged
wife
cried
bertram
chesleigh
gladly
oh
god
if
only
she
had
lived
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
asked
suddenly
where
is
richard
leith
now
he
is
lying
ill
in
the
western
wing
of
glenalvan
hall
frederick
replied
with
some
embarrassment
at
the
inward
consciousness
of
who
caused
that
illness
is
is
possible
i
must
go
to
him
at
once
cried
bertram
starting
up
i
am
an
old
friend
of
richard
leith
will
you
accompany
me
fred
frederick
walked
with
him
across
the
grassy
slope
of
the
lawn
but
left
him
in
the
wide
corridor
that
separated
the
divided
dwellings
of
the
strangely
sundered
family
i
can
accompany
you
no
further
he
said
confusedly
the
truth
is
leith
and
father
have
had
a
little
difficulty
and
we
are
not
on
the
best
of
terms
he
turned
away
and
bertram
knocked
nervously
on
the
door
before
him
and
was
admitted
by
dinah
who
scowled
blackly
when
she
saw
whom
the
visitor
was
i
wish
to
see
leith
he
said
and
the
old
woman
silently
motioned
him
to
follow
her
into
the
sick
man
room
white
as
the
pillows
on
which
he
lay
was
richard
leith
but
there
was
a
smile
of
peace
on
his
face
for
gertrude
was
sitting
in
a
chair
by
his
bedside
and
she
had
been
telling
him
of
the
strange
scene
at
golden
burial
that
evening
how
bertram
chesleigh
had
claimed
her
as
his
wife
and
the
child
for
his
own
thank
god
she
was
innocent
and
pure
oh
how
could
i
ever
have
doubted
the
child
of
my
precious
golden
cried
the
bereaved
father
in
a
passion
of
remorse
and
grief
you
know
the
whole
truth
now
can
you
ever
forgive
me
inquired
bertram
advancing
you
here
bertram
chesleigh
oh
how
could
you
have
been
so
cruel
exclaimed
leith
excitedly
as
he
rose
on
his
elbow
and
looked
at
the
pale
face
and
gleaming
eyes
of
the
intruder
i
will
tell
you
all
the
truth
and
perhaps
you
will
understand
me
better
began
bertram
chesleigh
eagerly
but
before
the
words
were
ended
a
terrible
change
came
over
his
face
it
was
distorted
by
contortions
of
pain
and
with
a
shrill
cry
of
agony
he
fell
to
the
floor
in
strong
convulsions
gertrude
sprang
from
her
chair
with
a
frightened
shriek
that
brought
dinah
rushing
into
the
room
with
her
old
master
close
at
her
heels
followed
by
the
hired
nurse
who
had
the
care
of
leith
this
man
is
dying
bring
a
doctor
at
once
cried
gertrude
shrilly
the
doctor
is
here
madam
said
the
pleasant
voice
of
the
physician
himself
who
had
just
entered
the
door
on
his
usual
daily
visit
to
leith
why
what
have
we
here
he
bent
down
over
the
tall
superb
form
that
lay
upon
the
floor
writhing
in
a
violent
fit
there
were
a
few
moments
of
busy
silence
while
he
worked
over
the
patient
then
he
looked
up
with
a
dark
frown
on
his
broad
brow
who
is
this
man
and
how
came
he
here
he
inquired
he
is
my
doctor
and
he
had
barely
entered
the
room
when
he
fell
in
a
fit
said
richard
leith
what
ails
him
another
dire
contortion
of
the
prostrate
form
and
the
busy
physician
answered
sternly
he
has
all
the
symptoms
of
arsenical
poisoning
the
hovering
night
fell
rainy
dark
and
cheerless
the
skillful
physician
worked
steadily
anxiously
and
patiently
trying
to
save
from
the
grasp
of
the
fell
destroyer
the
writhing
victim
of
elinor
glenalvan
deadly
hate
and
wicked
revenge
everyone
was
filled
with
grief
and
sorrow
all
warring
passions
all
human
resentments
were
forgotten
in
the
anxiety
with
which
they
watched
the
wavering
balance
in
which
bertram
chesleigh
lay
fluctuating
between
life
and
death
arsenic
had
been
administered
to
him
in
a
draught
of
wine
declared
the
physician
and
the
wonder
arose
who
had
given
it
to
him
someone
started
the
theory
that
he
had
taken
it
himself
with
intent
to
commit
suicide
then
they
searched
him
but
not
a
grain
of
the
deadly
drug
was
discovered
on
his
person
it
was
all
a
baffling
mystery
they
had
left
him
mourning
despairingly
over
little
golden
grave
and
they
had
seen
him
no
more
until
he
had
come
to
them
in
this
awful
condition
if
i
had
not
come
in
at
the
moment
i
did
no
earthly
power
could
have
saved
him
declared
the
physician
as
it
is
i
hope
mind
i
only
say
hope
that
i
may
save
his
life
at
midnight
gertrude
stole
to
the
outer
door
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
she
felt
faint
weary
and
dispirited
the
death
of
golden
whom
she
had
learned
to
love
very
deeply
had
deeply
grieved
her
saddened
heart
poor
child
she
moaned
sitting
down
on
the
marble
steps
and
gazing
sadly
at
the
silver
crescent
of
the
young
moon
as
it
struggled
through
a
bank
of
clouds
she
has
had
a
fate
as
tragic
and
sad
as
her
poor
young
mother
the
sound
of
muffled
footsteps
on
the
grass
caused
gertrude
to
start
up
with
a
sudden
cry
a
youth
was
coming
toward
her
and
his
low
entreating
stay
madam
arrested
her
contemplated
flight
he
came
close
to
her
side
and
as
his
rough
garments
brushed
the
stone
ballustrade
the
cool
moist
smell
of
newly
thrown
up
earth
came
distinctly
to
her
senses
she
shivered
and
thought
of
that
grave
lying
in
the
silence
and
calm
of
the
dewy
night
will
you
tell
me
if
chesleigh
is
here
he
inquired
respectfully
yes
he
is
here
what
can
you
want
of
chesleigh
at
this
unseemly
hour
of
the
night
she
inquired
in
wonder
i
have
important
business
with
him
said
the
youth
and
gertrude
thought
she
detected
a
trembling
as
of
fear
in
his
voice
can
i
see
him
a
moment
if
you
please
no
you
can
not
for
he
is
ill
and
unconscious
and
we
fear
that
he
is
dying
she
replied
a
smothered
exclamation
escaped
from
the
youth
lips
oh
this
is
dreadful
he
said
as
if
unconscious
of
having
a
listener
what
shall
we
do
now
can
i
help
you
asked
gertrude
gently
he
bent
toward
her
eagerly
oh
madam
you
are
a
friend
of
the
poor
lady
that
was
buried
this
afternoon
he
said
almost
fearfully
yes
she
answered
with
a
quickened
then
come
with
me
for
god
sake
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
do
be
afraid
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
so
impressed
was
gertrude
by
the
youth
strange
eagerness
that
she
followed
him
without
a
word
across
the
green
lawn
through
the
wide
gate
and
along
the
winding
road
not
here
she
said
aghast
as
he
paused
at
the
white
gate
of
the
glenalvan
burying
ground
yes
even
here
he
answered
solemnly
and
the
clicked
softly
beneath
his
hand
follow
me
lady
no
harm
shall
happen
you
chapter
xliv
when
bertram
chesleigh
came
to
full
consciousness
again
he
found
himself
lying
on
a
couch
in
leith
bedroom
the
curtains
were
drawn
at
the
windows
but
the
light
of
the
full
day
glimmered
through
and
he
saw
the
physician
sitting
beside
him
while
richard
leith
from
the
bed
opposite
regarded
him
with
an
intent
expression
he
struggled
up
feebly
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
brow
i
have
had
a
shock
he
said
with
an
air
of
strange
perplexity
as
he
looked
into
their
anxious
faces
what
was
it
what
has
happened
to
me
you
have
been
near
to
death
door
replied
the
physician
gravely
but
you
will
recover
now
i
wish
that
i
had
died
the
young
man
burst
out
with
such
passionate
realization
of
his
misery
that
the
doctor
exclaimed
incautiously
so
then
you
try
to
commit
suicide
the
brilliant
dark
eyes
looked
at
him
in
amazement
suicide
suicide
he
repeated
blankly
who
dares
to
say
that
of
me
the
doctor
regarded
him
thoughtfully
my
dear
sir
he
said
quietly
i
happened
in
here
very
opportunely
last
evening
and
found
you
suffering
all
the
terrible
symptoms
of
arsenic
poisoning
your
friends
feared
that
your
grief
had
unhinged
your
mind
and
that
under
temporary
aberration
you
had
attempted
the
destruction
of
your
own
life
they
were
wrong
i
could
never
have
been
such
a
coward
bertram
answered
in
such
a
tone
of
convincing
truthfulness
that
no
one
could
doubt
him
indeed
doctor
you
must
have
been
mistaken
i
have
taken
no
drug
recently
i
am
not
mistaken
the
physician
asserted
confidently
you
had
most
certainly
had
arsenic
administered
to
you
in
a
draught
of
wine
a
startled
gleam
came
into
chesleigh
eyes
his
face
whitened
a
cry
of
horror
came
from
his
lips
doctor
are
you
quite
quite
sure
he
exclaimed
i
would
swear
to
the
drug
was
the
instant
reply
do
you
admit
the
wine
yes
came
the
grave
reply
i
drank
a
glass
of
wine
before
coming
in
here
yesterday
evening
but
i
did
not
dream
it
was
drugged
and
an
expression
of
almost
incredulous
horror
swept
over
the
handsome
face
who
gave
you
the
wine
inquired
the
doctor
and
richard
leith
almost
simultaneously
but
bertram
chesleigh
shook
his
head
do
not
ask
me
he
said
it
is
terrible
yet
i
will
not
betray
my
destroyer
it
was
one
of
the
glenalvans
asserted
richard
leith
seeing
the
truth
as
by
a
flash
of
light
do
not
ask
me
the
young
man
replied
again
i
must
not
tell
you
it
is
too
terrible
i
can
scarce
believe
the
dread
reality
myself
but
though
he
refused
to
reveal
the
secret
richard
leith
felt
morally
certain
that
it
was
to
some
of
the
family
of
john
glenalvan
the
young
man
owed
the
attempted
destruction
of
his
life
he
had
heard
that
elinor
had
set
her
cap
at
him
this
then
was
the
dreadful
revenge
she
had
taken
for
her
disappointment
the
physician
went
away
and
left
them
together
then
the
lawyer
told
his
his
whole
sad
story
bertram
indignation
knew
no
bounds
may
the
curse
of
an
offended
god
rest
upon
john
glenalvan
head
he
exclaimed
it
is
to
him
and
his
family
that
my
poor
golden
owes
the
bitter
sorrows
of
her
brief
life
my
sister
maid
celine
confessed
that
it
was
elinor
glenalvan
who
discovered
golden
identity
and
bribed
her
to
send
her
away
under
a
ban
of
disgrace
oh
god
leith
could
i
only
have
known
that
the
girl
little
ruby
loved
so
dearly
and
who
shunned
me
so
persistently
was
my
deserted
wife
how
joyously
would
i
have
taken
her
to
my
heart
and
claimed
her
for
my
own
yes
if
you
had
only
known
richard
leith
replied
with
mournful
emphasis
my
poor
young
daughter
hers
indeed
was
a
hard
lot
scorned
by
her
kindred
deserted
by
her
husband
despised
and
disowned
by
her
miserable
father
how
glad
she
must
have
been
to
creep
into
the
kindly
shelter
of
the
grave
ah
heaven
chesleigh
i
never
can
forget
my
own
wretched
share
in
breaking
that
tender
heart
his
head
sank
back
on
his
pillow
and
almost
womanly
tears
coursed
over
his
pale
cheeks
but
she
forgave
me
before
she
died
he
continued
pathetically
after
a
little
she
was
an
angel
chesleigh
i
can
never
forget
how
sweet
and
patient
she
was
the
day
before
she
died
they
carried
me
into
her
room
i
lay
on
a
couch
by
the
side
of
her
bed
they
showed
me
the
beautiful
little
waxen
image
the
babe
that
had
never
drawn
a
single
breath
of
life
in
this
world
and
i
could
not
keep
from
crying
when
they
said
her
terrible
fall
had
killed
the
child
the
minister
came
and
told
her
that
she
must
die
in
a
few
hours
too
but
was
it
not
strange
chesleigh
she
smiled
sadly
and
shook
her
head
you
are
all
mistaken
she
said
should
not
be
sorry
to
die
but
my
time
has
not
come
yet
i
can
not
die
until
i
know
whether
i
shall
meet
my
mother
in
heaven
or
whether
she
is
still
on
earth
but
that
night
she
passed
away
peacefully
in
her
sleep
it
was
so
calm
and
gradual
we
did
not
know
when
the
end
had
come
it
was
like
those
sweet
lines
of
hood
watched
her
breathing
through
the
night
her
breathing
soft
and
low
as
in
her
breast
the
wave
of
life
went
heaving
to
and
fro
our
very
hopes
belied
our
fears
our
fears
our
hopes
belied
we
thought
her
dying
when
she
slept
and
sleeping
when
she
died
he
ceased
and
there
was
a
heavy
silence
in
the
room
bertram
chesleigh
broke
it
in
a
hushed
low
voice
poor
martyred
child
was
she
then
so
anxious
to
find
her
mother
she
declared
that
it
was
the
one
dream
of
her
richard
leith
replied
and
there
is
no
clew
save
that
which
john
glenalvan
holds
inquired
bertram
thoughtfully
none
and
the
villain
has
fled
i
do
not
believe
his
own
wife
and
children
know
aught
of
his
whereabouts
a
look
of
grave
determination
swept
over
bertram
handsome
pallid
face
then
i
will
take
up
the
quest
where
it
dropped
from
golden
little
hand
in
dying
i
will
track
the
villain
if
it
is
to
the
end
of
the
world
it
shall
be
my
task
to
vindicate
her
mother
memory
he
said
gravely
and
earnestly
it
is
task
rather
said
richard
leith
we
will
join
hands
in
the
effort
his
answered
old
dinah
came
in
with
a
note
for
leith
it
was
from
gertrude
i
have
gone
away
she
wrote
i
can
leave
you
no
address
but
i
shall
be
cognizant
of
all
that
transpires
at
glenalvan
hall
and
i
may
see
you
again
ere
long
you
will
soon
be
well
enough
to
go
about
again
and
that
you
may
be
enabled
to
solve
the
distressing
mystery
of
your
lost
wife
fate
is
the
earnest
prayer
of
gertrude
surely
no
man
was
ever
placed
in
such
a
terrible
position
said
richard
leith
for
aught
i
know
i
may
have
two
wives
living
it
is
through
no
fault
of
yours
replied
chesleigh
but
it
is
most
distressing
your
second
wife
appears
to
be
a
very
beautiful
and
winning
woman
she
is
both
but
i
never
discovered
her
worth
until
it
was
too
late
to
love
her
leith
replied
sadly
her
noble
conduct
to
my
helpless
daughter
first
opened
my
eyes
to
her
lovable
character
god
bless
her
bertram
chesleigh
uttered
fervently
they
had
some
further
conversation
and
then
chesleigh
announced
his
intention
of
going
away
i
will
not
trespass
further
on
glenalvan
hospitality
he
said
decidedly
i
do
not
forget
how
much
reason
he
has
to
hate
the
sight
of
me
chapter
xlv
the
twilight
hour
found
bertram
chesleigh
wending
his
way
to
the
green
graveyard
where
his
hapless
wife
lay
buried
as
he
had
hoped
he
found
the
old
waiting
for
him
he
had
been
sodding
the
mound
with
velvety
green
turf
and
planting
lilies
and
immortelles
upon
it
why
have
you
done
this
he
said
did
you
not
know
i
would
come
i
was
at
death
door
last
night
or
i
would
have
come
as
i
said
did
you
do
what
you
promised
yes
sir
and
waited
a
long
time
for
you
said
the
man
doffing
his
cap
respectfully
i
even
sent
my
son
to
look
for
you
he
learned
of
your
bad
condition
and
then
we
were
compelled
to
put
the
coffin
back
in
the
ground
again
there
was
a
strange
repressed
excitement
in
the
man
manner
but
chesleigh
absorbed
in
the
bitterness
of
his
own
despair
did
not
observe
it
he
counted
over
a
hundred
dollars
into
the
man
hand
and
then
said
with
a
tremor
of
hope
in
his
voice
i
will
double
the
amount
if
you
will
do
your
work
over
i
see
her
i
am
mad
for
one
last
look
at
my
darling
face
the
shuddered
oh
sir
it
is
too
late
he
said
have
you
forgotten
how
soon
death
touch
blasts
everything
human
and
the
little
babe
was
dead
long
before
was
i
know
you
could
not
bear
to
see
them
now
hush
hush
the
mourner
cried
in
a
voice
of
agony
i
will
hear
no
more
go
now
and
leave
me
cheer
up
sir
said
the
man
with
a
strange
gleam
in
his
eyes
as
he
turned
to
go
the
lord
may
have
some
blessing
in
store
for
you
yet
sir
his
only
answer
was
a
hollow
groan
from
the
wretched
man
he
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
green
grave
crushing
all
the
sweet
lilies
and
immortelles
beneath
his
shuddering
frame
and
cried
out
to
heaven
to
kill
him
because
he
had
blighted
golden
innocent
life
he
lay
there
an
hour
or
two
musing
sorrowfully
over
the
hapless
fate
of
his
beautiful
he
recalled
their
brief
happy
from
which
they
had
been
so
rudely
awakened
over
and
over
again
he
cursed
himself
for
that
first
impulse
of
pride
and
selfishness
that
had
made
him
false
to
his
bride
in
the
hour
when
he
should
have
protected
and
shielded
her
a
passionate
despairing
longing
to
see
her
again
filled
his
soul
i
will
go
back
and
wander
by
the
lake
again
he
resolved
in
the
madness
of
his
despair
it
was
there
that
we
spent
our
sweetest
most
blissful
hours
in
the
calm
and
silence
of
the
night
i
will
dream
them
over
again
he
went
to
the
lake
but
the
very
spirit
of
unrest
was
upon
him
the
stars
came
forth
and
shone
weirdly
in
the
sky
the
perfume
of
spring
flowers
sweetened
the
air
he
grew
restless
and
fanciful
such
a
brief
while
ago
she
had
stolen
nightly
from
the
haunted
rooms
to
meet
him
here
beside
the
silvery
lake
it
almost
seemed
that
she
would
come
to
him
presently
gliding
like
a
fairy
across
the
green
lawn
to
the
glad
shelter
of
his
arms
some
impulse
prompted
him
to
seek
the
haunted
rooms
to
spend
an
hour
of
solitary
musing
in
their
quiet
shade
he
knew
of
a
retired
stairway
by
which
he
could
make
his
way
unperceived
and
following
the
blind
fate
that
led
him
he
went
up
to
the
hall
and
up
the
narrow
secluded
stairs
which
little
golden
had
shown
him
and
by
which
she
had
obtained
egress
to
her
lover
he
went
along
the
dark
corridor
with
a
strangely
beating
heart
and
paused
before
the
closed
door
of
the
haunted
room
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
knob
but
to
his
surprise
it
refused
to
yield
to
his
touch
disappointed
he
was
about
turning
away
when
a
heavy
step
crossed
the
floor
inside
the
key
clicked
in
the
lock
and
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
a
flood
of
light
streamed
out
into
the
corridor
and
showed
bertram
chesleigh
the
tall
form
and
dark
saturnine
face
of
john
glenalvan
there
was
a
moment
of
complete
astonishment
on
the
part
of
each
of
the
two
men
both
recoiled
from
each
other
in
the
first
suddenness
of
the
shock
and
then
an
angry
oath
burst
from
john
glenalvan
lips
i
thought
it
was
elinor
luckily
you
were
mistaken
returned
chesleigh
quickly
recovering
his
wits
this
is
most
opportune
for
me
sir
i
have
wished
to
see
you
he
stepped
into
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
boldly
confronted
the
villain
who
glared
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
defiance
and
dismay
you
wished
to
see
me
i
feel
flattered
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
cutting
sarcasm
may
i
ask
why
there
was
a
moment
silence
while
bertram
chesleigh
rapidly
reviewed
the
situation
in
his
mind
then
he
spoke
you
may
ask
and
i
may
answer
he
said
glenalvan
i
might
heap
the
bitterest
reproach
upon
your
head
if
by
so
doing
the
cruel
work
of
your
life
might
be
undone
but
the
past
is
past
my
wife
is
dead
and
no
reproaches
and
no
lamentations
can
bring
her
back
to
me
but
there
is
one
issue
between
you
and
me
i
have
taken
up
my
dead
wife
quest
where
she
left
it
i
demand
that
you
shall
tell
me
where
to
find
my
little
golden
mother
the
dark
face
before
him
whitened
to
the
awful
pallor
of
death
the
man
eyes
blazed
luridly
his
hands
were
clenched
as
they
hung
at
his
sides
what
if
i
refuse
to
answer
your
question
he
inquired
in
a
low
tense
voice
i
will
find
means
to
force
you
to
confession
bertram
chesleigh
replied
unhesitatingly
i
defy
you
to
do
so
john
glenalvan
replied
with
an
imprecation
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
you
have
caused
my
wife
death
and
nearly
murdered
her
father
i
will
have
you
arrested
for
it
exclaimed
chesleigh
do
so
and
i
will
prove
that
i
only
acted
in
was
the
instant
reply
i
will
charge
you
with
the
murder
or
abduction
of
golden
leith
your
own
sister
pursued
chesleigh
and
i
will
swear
before
any
court
in
the
land
that
she
is
the
inmate
of
a
nameless
house
in
new
york
was
the
taunting
answer
of
the
villain
they
gazed
at
each
other
a
moment
then
bertram
chesleigh
exclaimed
in
wonder
what
a
black
and
unnatural
heart
you
must
have
john
glenalvan
how
can
you
thus
malign
the
fair
fame
of
your
own
sister
do
not
call
her
my
sister
i
hated
her
the
creature
she
stole
the
love
of
my
parents
from
me
it
was
all
lavished
on
her
there
was
none
left
for
me
but
i
have
had
a
most
glorious
revenge
he
laughed
wickedly
yes
you
have
had
a
most
terrible
revenge
said
bertram
chesleigh
with
a
shudder
you
have
blighted
her
life
and
that
of
her
child
four
lives
perhaps
five
have
been
ruined
by
your
sin
is
it
not
time
that
vengeance
should
cease
no
thundered
john
glenalvan
harshly
for
sixteen
years
the
taste
of
revenge
has
been
sweet
on
my
lips
it
is
sweet
still
and
you
will
not
speak
asked
bertram
chesleigh
never
with
triumphant
malice
i
have
one
card
yet
to
play
began
the
other
slowly
a
light
step
suddenly
crossed
the
threshold
and
elinor
glenalvan
appeared
in
the
room
bearing
a
waiter
with
a
substantial
supper
arranged
upon
it
papa
were
you
growing
impatient
she
asked
then
her
startled
eyes
fell
on
bertram
chesleigh
meeting
a
glance
of
fiery
scorn
she
gasped
the
waiter
fell
from
her
nerveless
hands
and
its
contents
crashed
upon
the
floor
chapter
xlvi
yes
miss
glenalvan
it
is
i
was
the
answer
as
his
burning
eyes
devoured
her
pale
frightened
face
did
you
take
me
for
a
ghost
why
should
i
take
you
for
a
ghost
she
faltered
trembling
but
trying
to
brave
it
out
with
an
air
of
defiance
because
you
tried
to
murder
me
last
night
and
came
very
near
succeeding
he
replied
it
is
false
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
such
a
crime
she
broke
out
passionately
flying
to
her
father
side
as
if
for
protection
how
dare
you
echoed
john
glenalvan
furiously
bertram
chesleigh
lifted
his
hand
imperiously
listen
he
said
i
told
you
i
had
one
more
card
to
play
your
fair
daughter
there
attempted
to
poison
me
last
night
with
drugged
wine
the
physician
who
saved
my
life
declared
that
i
had
taken
arsenic
in
a
draught
of
wine
do
you
see
where
you
stand
do
not
believe
him
father
it
is
false
cried
elinor
furiously
but
john
glenalvan
turning
to
look
into
her
wild
frightened
face
read
the
signs
of
guilt
too
plainly
to
be
mistaken
the
sight
forced
a
groan
even
from
his
hardened
lips
you
see
where
you
stand
repeated
bertram
chesleigh
with
stern
brevity
how
will
you
bear
to
see
your
cherished
daughter
dragged
into
court
on
such
a
dreadful
charge
you
will
not
dare
do
such
a
thing
elinor
flashed
out
quivering
with
rage
that
will
be
as
your
father
says
was
the
firm
reply
if
it
pleases
him
to
reveal
the
secret
of
golden
leith
fate
i
spare
you
and
him
if
not
you
need
expect
no
mercy
from
me
the
grim
was
spoken
elinor
and
her
father
knew
by
that
flashing
eye
and
lip
that
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
decision
coward
to
threaten
a
girl
she
cried
taking
refuge
in
vituperation
now
that
denial
had
failed
but
chesleigh
regarded
them
in
silent
scorn
and
her
father
sternly
silenced
her
he
was
furious
with
wrath
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
not
even
for
his
daughter
sake
could
he
forego
his
dear
revenge
elinor
he
said
with
a
dark
frown
if
indeed
you
have
done
this
thing
you
must
prepare
to
face
the
consequences
i
will
not
accede
to
his
demand
nothing
shall
balk
me
of
my
revenge
abject
terror
and
despair
filled
elinor
soul
at
those
threatening
words
she
knew
too
well
how
guilty
she
was
she
was
filled
with
terror
at
the
too
probable
punishment
of
her
wickedness
falling
on
her
knees
she
caught
her
father
hand
in
hers
and
bathed
them
with
her
frightened
tears
oh
father
do
not
sacrifice
me
to
your
revenge
she
cried
wildly
remember
that
i
am
your
own
child
i
should
be
dearer
to
you
than
your
revenge
oh
for
mercy
sake
make
terms
with
the
wretch
and
save
me
from
his
wicked
vengeance
chesleigh
did
not
even
notice
her
he
stood
with
folded
arms
and
curling
lips
awaiting
his
enemy
reply
the
sullen
determination
on
john
glenalvan
face
softened
as
she
continued
her
anxious
pleading
father
i
can
not
live
if
that
wretched
story
becomes
known
she
wailed
if
you
do
not
save
me
i
shall
drown
myself
a
slight
shudder
convulsed
his
frame
at
the
words
he
looked
down
at
the
frightened
face
elinor
he
said
if
i
have
to
sacrifice
my
revenge
for
your
sake
i
shall
hate
you
every
moment
of
your
future
life
anything
but
exposure
she
wailed
oh
father
save
me
his
dark
brow
lowered
like
a
thunder
cloud
so
be
it
he
said
but
mark
me
girl
i
shall
hate
you
forever
after
then
you
will
speak
bertram
chesleigh
cried
gladly
john
glenalvan
hesitated
a
moment
then
answered
gloomily
yes
to
save
that
wretched
girl
i
will
reveal
the
secret
that
has
been
locked
in
my
breast
for
sixteen
years
chapter
xlvii
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
bertram
chesleigh
said
quickly
come
with
me
glenalvan
let
the
secret
you
have
kept
so
long
be
revealed
in
the
hearing
of
your
father
and
richard
leith
the
guilty
man
recoiled
from
the
demand
he
said
hoarsely
i
refuse
to
do
so
i
will
reveal
it
to
you
and
you
may
bear
the
news
yourself
to
them
bertram
chesleigh
considered
the
reply
a
moment
then
answered
firmly
i
prefer
that
they
should
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
john
glenalvan
regarded
him
with
furious
eyes
you
wish
to
humble
me
all
you
can
he
said
not
so
replied
chesleigh
but
i
consider
that
they
have
too
decided
a
right
to
hear
your
confession
for
me
to
exclude
them
from
this
momentous
interview
the
angry
man
regarded
him
silently
a
moment
then
said
with
a
sigh
of
baffled
rage
so
be
it
i
am
not
now
in
a
position
to
dictate
terms
and
must
obey
your
will
you
swear
to
keep
elinor
secret
if
i
do
this
thing
yes
bertram
answered
i
am
ready
to
accompany
you
then
elinor
he
turned
a
furious
gaze
on
his
daughter
who
was
weeping
nervously
near
the
door
go
to
your
mother
now
tell
her
that
you
have
ruined
all
my
plans
and
that
i
forever
curse
the
hour
in
which
you
were
born
she
turned
away
casting
one
last
look
of
fiery
anger
and
hatred
on
the
man
she
had
tried
to
murder
and
left
the
room
the
two
men
went
down
together
to
richard
leith
room
the
lawyer
was
sitting
up
in
an
talking
to
old
hugh
glenalvan
who
occupied
a
chair
near
the
window
they
both
looked
up
in
surprise
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
john
glenalvan
whom
they
had
supposed
to
be
far
away
in
hiding
somewhere
bertram
spoke
at
once
quietly
you
will
pardon
this
late
intrusion
glenalvan
this
gentleman
has
an
important
communication
to
make
to
you
and
i
ventured
to
bring
him
at
once
a
communication
faltered
the
old
man
looking
blankly
at
his
son
yes
answered
chesleigh
with
the
flush
of
joyful
triumph
on
his
handsome
face
he
will
solve
for
you
the
strange
mystery
of
your
daughter
disappearance
sixteen
years
ago
a
cry
came
from
richard
leith
white
lips
the
old
man
echoed
it
feebly
as
he
rose
and
went
to
his
son
but
john
waved
him
rudely
back
do
not
come
near
me
he
said
harshly
i
have
always
hated
you
because
you
loved
my
sister
best
i
could
not
help
it
john
she
was
more
lovable
than
you
the
father
faltered
feebly
and
so
she
stole
your
love
from
me
and
earned
my
hate
but
i
have
had
a
great
revenge
said
the
relentless
wretch
grimly
oh
john
john
the
wailing
cry
came
from
the
old
man
lips
he
looked
at
his
son
in
surprise
and
horror
yes
revenge
repeated
john
glenalvan
seeming
to
take
a
malicious
pride
in
his
wickedness
now
that
its
revelation
was
forced
upon
him
i
hated
her
and
when
my
opportunity
came
i
seized
upon
it
i
knew
she
was
a
wife
yet
it
was
my
hand
that
sent
her
that
lying
letter
that
made
her
leave
her
husband
devil
richard
leith
muttered
making
an
effort
to
spring
upon
him
but
bertram
chesleigh
held
him
back
and
the
villain
who
had
so
wronged
him
laughed
mockingly
she
came
home
he
went
on
after
a
minute
came
home
and
her
child
was
born
the
following
night
came
her
mysterious
disappearance
which
i
accounted
for
by
declaring
that
she
had
returned
to
her
deceiver
unable
to
exist
away
from
him
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
dark
demoniac
face
as
he
proceeded
every
heart
hung
trembling
on
his
further
words
at
last
the
fearful
mystery
of
little
golden
fate
would
be
known
to
those
who
loved
and
mourned
her
old
dinah
had
stolen
silently
in
and
sat
crouching
in
a
corner
her
beady
black
eyes
fixed
intently
on
the
face
of
the
man
whom
she
had
always
distrusted
speak
richard
leith
thundered
almost
mad
with
impatience
speak
you
know
she
never
came
to
me
where
is
she
now
my
poor
wronged
darling
is
she
dead
or
living
echoed
the
wronged
woman
father
is
john
glenalvan
answered
coldly
dead
they
echoed
despairingly
she
has
been
dead
these
sixteen
years
he
answered
vile
wretch
then
you
murdered
her
cried
richard
leith
struggling
frantically
in
bertram
chesleigh
strong
hold
the
villain
laughed
heartlessly
not
so
he
replied
i
hated
her
but
i
would
not
have
risked
hanging
for
her
sake
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
that
she
came
to
her
death
so
tragically
dead
and
buried
these
sixteen
years
old
hugh
moaned
wringing
his
feeble
hands
and
weeping
as
if
the
bereavement
were
but
of
yesterday
john
tell
me
where
to
find
my
darling
grave
lies
in
the
bottom
of
the
he
replied
and
those
who
watched
him
saw
him
shudder
and
turn
pale
for
the
first
time
how
came
she
there
broke
out
bertram
chesleigh
my
sister
was
a
somnambulist
chesleigh
you
will
not
deny
that
fact
father
she
wandered
from
the
house
in
her
sleep
and
walked
deliberately
into
the
lake
you
saw
her
yes
i
was
the
only
witness
to
the
tragic
deed
he
replied
and
again
they
saw
a
shudder
shake
his
strong
frame
and
the
chill
dew
beaded
his
forehead
devil
you
lie
you
pushed
her
in
cried
richard
leith
wild
with
rage
and
grief
did
you
john
oh
tell
me
the
truth
moaned
his
father
no
i
did
not
as
there
is
a
heaven
that
hears
me
i
hated
golden
because
you
and
my
mother
loved
her
best
and
because
half
of
your
property
would
go
to
her
but
the
thought
of
murder
had
not
entered
my
head
i
was
out
late
that
night
and
returning
with
my
mind
full
of
envious
thoughts
toward
my
sister
i
saw
her
crossing
the
moonlighted
lawn
and
on
coming
nearer
saw
that
she
was
asleep
keeping
near
to
her
i
followed
her
down
to
the
lake
and
she
walked
on
straight
without
pause
or
backward
glance
into
the
water
and
you
put
out
no
hand
to
save
her
murderer
cried
bertram
chesleigh
in
terrific
scorn
i
did
not
know
what
she
would
do
until
all
was
over
he
replied
you
might
have
saved
her
even
then
bertram
chesleigh
said
yes
i
might
but
i
hated
her
and
the
devil
whispered
to
me
that
this
was
my
opportunity
so
i
watched
the
water
close
over
her
head
and
then
i
walked
away
he
replied
oh
my
god
is
de
vengeance
ob
hebben
asleep
dat
such
debbils
roam
de
yerth
wailed
old
dinah
they
echoed
her
cry
surely
the
vengeance
of
heaven
slumbered
that
such
demons
walked
the
earth
unsmitten
then
temptation
entered
my
soul
he
continued
i
did
not
think
it
was
right
for
golden
child
to
inherit
her
share
of
the
property
when
i
needed
it
so
much
for
my
own
growing
family
so
i
fabricated
that
slander
and
eventually
forced
my
father
to
make
over
the
remnant
of
the
glenalvans
possessions
to
me
and
i
transferred
my
hatred
from
golden
to
her
child
now
you
know
all
old
hugh
pointed
to
the
door
with
a
shaking
finger
go
now
before
i
call
down
the
terrible
vengeance
of
god
on
your
guilty
head
he
cried
go
and
leave
me
to
weep
for
my
murdered
darling
chapter
xlviii
the
next
day
men
were
set
to
work
to
drag
the
lake
for
golden
body
a
poor
bleached
skeleton
partially
petrified
by
the
action
of
the
water
and
therefore
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
was
all
they
found
the
broad
gold
band
of
a
still
clung
to
the
fleshless
finger
and
the
name
within
was
all
that
remained
to
assure
them
that
this
was
she
whom
they
sought
the
hapless
girl
whose
bright
life
had
been
blasted
by
a
brother
sin
and
whose
name
had
been
covered
with
ignominy
and
shame
for
sixteen
years
they
placed
the
precious
remains
in
a
coffin
and
prepared
to
give
them
christian
burial
the
next
day
all
night
and
all
day
it
stood
on
trestles
in
hugh
with
mourners
at
head
and
foot
the
husband
and
father
so
tragically
bereaved
of
their
darling
sat
there
dumb
and
tearless
in
their
great
affliction
and
old
dinah
stole
in
and
out
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
pressed
to
her
streaming
eyes
her
old
black
face
convulsed
with
grief
only
a
few
days
ago
the
daughter
coffin
had
stood
there
where
the
mother
rested
now
both
her
nurslings
were
gone
and
the
faithful
old
creature
heart
was
almost
broken
throughout
the
night
and
day
not
a
member
of
john
glenalvan
family
was
visible
the
curtains
remained
drawn
at
the
windows
the
doors
closed
there
was
no
sign
of
life
within
the
house
the
time
came
when
poor
little
golden
remains
were
to
be
consigned
to
the
kindly
shelter
of
the
grave
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
about
the
first
of
march
the
grass
was
blue
with
violets
the
birds
twittered
softly
in
the
orange
and
magnolia
trees
the
sun
shone
brightly
as
it
slowly
declined
in
the
western
sky
dinah
had
been
in
and
deposited
some
beautiful
wreaths
of
flowers
upon
the
bier
the
friends
who
had
loved
the
dead
woman
long
ago
had
come
to
know
her
mournful
fate
at
last
and
had
sent
these
sweet
testimonials
of
their
sympathy
and
grief
they
were
waiting
in
the
graveyard
to
pay
the
last
outward
tokens
of
respect
to
the
lost
one
but
they
would
not
venture
to
the
house
to
intrude
on
the
privacy
of
the
bereaved
ones
so
the
gentle
minister
came
and
told
them
that
they
must
bid
a
last
farewell
to
the
loved
one
and
bertram
chesleigh
stood
ready
to
support
the
still
feeble
footsteps
of
richard
leith
with
his
strong
young
arm
oh
my
daughter
my
daughter
how
cruelly
god
has
afflicted
me
moaned
the
bereaved
father
laying
his
white
head
down
upon
the
while
the
first
heavy
tears
splashed
down
his
cheeks
do
not
arraign
your
maker
rather
thank
him
that
your
child
has
at
last
been
proven
pure
and
innocent
said
the
minister
to
whom
golden
whole
history
was
known
thank
god
bertram
chesleigh
uttered
fervently
then
with
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
sob
he
added
ah
if
only
my
wife
had
lived
to
see
this
day
she
lives
she
is
here
said
a
low
clear
voice
in
the
doorway
all
looked
around
startled
two
figures
were
entering
the
room
both
were
clothed
in
deep
mourning
one
was
gertrude
leith
pale
and
the
other
was
alight
and
deeply
veiled
she
clung
to
leith
arm
tremblingly
they
crossed
the
floor
and
stood
by
that
long
dark
solemn
object
that
occupied
the
center
of
the
room
leith
raised
her
companion
veil
all
started
and
uttered
a
cry
of
incredulous
surprise
little
golden
daughter
pallid
beautiful
tearful
was
standing
there
looking
at
them
across
her
mother
coffin
thank
god
she
said
in
her
sweet
clear
voice
with
a
sound
of
tears
in
its
sweetness
thank
god
my
mother
was
pure
and
innocent
the
dream
of
my
is
fulfilled
at
last
does
the
grave
give
up
its
dead
they
cried
and
bertram
chesleigh
went
to
her
side
and
touched
her
white
hand
my
wife
he
said
yes
your
wife
she
answered
lifting
her
violet
eyes
to
his
face
with
such
deep
reproach
in
their
tragic
depths
that
he
was
awed
into
momentary
silence
then
she
turned
from
him
and
went
to
her
grandfather
who
was
gazing
at
her
with
dazed
eyes
full
of
grief
and
dread
she
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
his
poor
withered
cheek
with
her
sweet
quivering
lips
grandpa
you
must
not
take
me
for
a
ghost
she
said
it
is
your
own
little
golden
come
back
to
live
and
love
you
again
i
was
not
dead
after
all
did
i
not
tell
you
i
could
not
die
yet
but
i
can
not
tell
you
all
the
story
of
my
rescue
from
the
grave
now
let
us
give
all
our
thoughts
to
our
martyred
dead
she
looked
up
and
saw
her
father
and
old
dinah
waiting
to
greet
her
it
was
a
strange
scene
beside
that
coffin
there
was
passionate
joy
over
the
living
girl
and
bitter
sorrow
over
the
dead
leith
had
beckoned
bertram
chesleigh
away
behind
the
heavy
hangings
of
the
she
said
to
him
gently
do
not
press
your
wife
yet
chesleigh
remember
you
have
wronged
her
deeply
and
she
does
not
yet
know
how
you
have
repented
and
atoned
i
can
never
atone
he
said
heavily
perhaps
she
may
think
differently
when
she
knows
all
said
leith
women
are
very
tender
and
forgiving
you
know
if
she
never
speaks
to
me
again
i
shall
still
rejoice
that
she
is
living
he
said
with
a
beam
of
gladness
in
his
large
black
eyes
do
you
wonder
how
she
was
saved
she
inquired
yes
i
will
tell
you
then
briefly
she
answered
you
remember
how
you
bribed
the
to
open
her
coffin
for
you
that
night
yes
and
then
i
was
too
ill
to
keep
my
appointment
he
answered
that
wild
fancy
of
yours
was
the
means
of
her
rescue
said
leith
when
the
man
opened
the
coffin
to
be
in
readiness
for
you
he
discovered
slight
signs
of
life
in
golden
growing
alarmed
and
impatient
at
your
tardiness
he
sent
his
son
to
look
for
you
and
the
youth
encountered
me
i
went
with
him
and
we
removed
her
to
the
little
cottage
near
by
little
by
little
we
fed
the
signs
of
reviving
life
and
you
see
the
result
for
which
i
bless
and
thank
you
forever
he
said
kissing
her
hand
respectfully
i
have
but
little
more
to
say
she
went
on
smiling
a
little
sadly
and
it
is
this
golden
is
very
weak
and
exhausted
yet
she
is
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
excitement
of
her
mother
burial
i
will
remain
here
with
her
while
they
are
bearing
leith
to
the
grave
and
i
will
tell
her
your
whole
story
she
shall
hear
how
you
came
back
here
to
seek
her
in
two
days
after
your
desertion
of
her
and
found
her
gone
i
will
tell
her
how
nobly
you
vindicated
her
honor
beside
her
grave
she
shall
know
that
you
forced
john
glenalvan
to
reveal
the
hidden
story
of
her
mother
fate
when
you
come
back
i
think
she
can
not
fail
to
forgive
you
you
will
do
all
this
for
me
he
said
with
a
strange
moisture
in
his
eyes
i
can
not
thank
you
sufficiently
you
are
an
angel
no
only
a
very
faulty
and
woman
she
replied
with
a
pensive
sigh
and
then
they
went
back
to
the
mourners
she
kept
her
promise
nobly
while
they
bore
the
poor
remains
of
richard
leith
first
wife
to
the
grave
his
second
wife
sat
with
his
daughter
and
tried
to
turn
the
swelling
current
of
her
grief
by
relating
the
story
of
bertram
chesleigh
repentance
and
atonement
golden
if
you
could
have
heard
his
noble
vindication
of
your
honor
beside
your
grave
how
proudly
he
claimed
you
for
his
wife
and
your
child
for
his
own
you
could
not
fail
to
pity
and
forgive
him
for
the
one
great
error
into
which
he
was
led
by
his
own
pride
and
john
glenalvan
evil
counsel
i
have
suffered
so
much
through
his
fault
said
the
wronged
wife
with
mournful
pathos
yes
dear
but
you
must
show
your
own
nobility
of
soul
now
said
the
gently
you
must
remember
err
is
human
to
forgive
divine
the
beautiful
pale
face
grew
very
grave
and
troubled
if
only
i
could
forget
his
cruelty
she
said
ah
my
friend
i
was
hurt
so
cruelly
by
that
letter
he
sent
me
i
trusted
him
so
fully
i
believed
in
his
truth
as
i
believed
in
my
god
i
was
almost
maddened
by
the
suddenness
of
my
sorrow
every
word
is
branded
upon
my
memory
see
i
can
repeat
every
sentence
it
almost
kills
me
to
forsake
you
golden
i
must
go
away
the
disgrace
of
your
birth
is
so
terrible
that
i
can
never
claim
you
for
my
wife
pride
and
honor
alike
forbid
it
you
must
see
for
yourself
poor
child
that
your
terrible
misfortune
has
wholly
set
you
apart
from
the
world
and
as
you
have
sworn
to
keep
our
private
marriage
a
secret
until
i
give
you
leave
to
reveal
it
i
must
beg
you
to
hold
the
story
unspoken
in
your
breast
forever
she
paused
and
looked
at
leith
with
a
whole
tragedy
of
sorrow
in
her
violet
orbs
were
they
not
cruel
words
to
write
to
his
own
wife
she
said
pathetically
but
i
obeyed
him
through
all
the
shame
and
sorrow
that
came
afterward
i
kept
my
promise
do
you
think
i
did
not
suffer
more
than
death
in
keeping
it
when
desmond
drove
me
out
in
such
terrible
disgrace
do
you
think
i
did
not
long
to
say
to
her
i
am
as
good
and
pure
as
you
are
i
am
your
brother
wife
and
what
did
i
not
suffer
when
i
knew
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
on
my
account
then
when
my
own
father
disowned
and
despised
me
how
my
heart
ached
to
answer
i
am
bertram
chesleigh
own
wife
oh
gertrude
is
it
right
and
just
that
i
should
forgive
him
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
and
made
others
suffer
for
his
sake
yes
dear
because
his
repentance
was
so
quick
and
his
remorse
so
deep
said
the
gentle
monitor
you
must
remember
golden
that
if
you
had
not
gone
away
that
night
you
would
have
escaped
all
that
suffering
your
husband
returned
in
hours
to
claim
you
and
john
glenalvan
told
him
that
you
had
gone
away
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
leading
a
sinful
life
do
you
wonder
that
it
threw
him
on
a
bed
of
sickness
that
almost
cost
him
his
life
you
must
forgive
him
and
love
him
again
dear
because
he
is
so
penitent
and
devoted
now
and
when
the
mourners
returned
from
that
sad
funeral
leith
sent
him
in
to
his
wronged
wife
he
knelt
down
before
the
pale
girl
and
begged
her
to
forgive
him
not
that
he
deserved
it
but
because
he
loved
her
so
dearly
with
the
meek
tenderness
of
woman
she
forgave
him
and
there
was
peace
between
them
several
hours
later
he
had
led
her
out
to
old
hugh
glenalvan
who
was
dozing
sadly
in
his
glenalvan
he
said
you
see
my
darling
has
risen
from
the
grave
to
forgive
me
will
you
keep
the
promise
you
made
and
forgive
me
too
yes
grandpa
you
must
forgive
him
for
i
love
him
dearly
said
little
golden
so
the
old
man
forgave
him
and
solemnly
blessed
them
as
they
knelt
before
him
one
withered
hand
resting
kindly
on
the
dark
bowed
head
and
the
other
on
the
golden
one
chapter
xlix
gertrude
leith
having
done
what
she
could
for
the
happiness
of
others
prepared
to
take
her
own
departure
you
will
not
leave
us
my
dear
true
friend
my
second
mother
golden
exclaimed
as
she
came
in
veiled
and
bonneted
to
bid
her
yes
dear
it
will
be
better
for
a
time
at
least
that
i
should
go
away
i
shall
return
north
and
go
back
to
those
quiet
quarters
in
brooklyn
where
you
and
i
spent
those
peaceful
weeks
before
we
came
south
when
you
come
to
new
york
with
your
husband
you
will
find
me
there
i
will
certainly
seek
you
out
golden
replied
but
surely
you
do
not
intend
to
forsake
my
father
the
doubt
and
perplexity
are
all
over
now
you
know
that
you
are
legally
his
wife
my
own
mother
being
dead
before
he
ever
knew
you
yes
i
know
dear
she
answered
gently
yet
it
is
best
i
should
go
away
for
a
time
your
father
must
have
time
for
his
grief
after
awhile
if
he
desires
it
i
may
return
to
him
her
words
were
too
full
of
wisdom
for
anyone
to
gainsay
them
so
she
went
away
richard
leith
grief
and
remorse
over
his
lost
little
golden
was
as
deep
and
passionate
as
if
she
had
died
yesterday
instead
of
more
than
sixteen
years
ago
he
was
too
sorrowful
to
remember
the
fair
woman
he
had
put
in
the
dead
wife
place
in
the
vain
hope
of
stilling
the
fever
and
pain
that
had
ached
ceaselessly
at
his
heart
for
sixteen
years
the
time
came
later
on
when
the
first
wife
memory
became
a
sweet
and
chastened
dream
to
him
and
his
second
wife
new
loveliness
of
character
won
its
place
in
his
heart
some
years
of
quiet
happiness
and
mutual
love
came
to
them
after
they
learned
to
know
each
other
better
but
there
was
no
year
in
which
richard
leith
did
not
return
south
once
at
least
to
spend
a
few
solemn
hours
by
the
low
grave
under
the
whispering
cedars
and
magnolias
where
the
broken
marble
shaft
bore
the
fond
inscription
in
loving
memory
of
golden
wife
of
richard
leith
there
was
one
other
to
whom
that
green
grave
became
like
a
shrine
a
holy
mecca
to
which
his
poor
faltering
footsteps
were
daily
bent
it
was
old
hugh
glenalvan
whom
old
dinah
daily
guided
to
the
sacred
spot
where
he
would
sit
for
hours
his
gray
locks
fluttering
in
the
gentle
breeze
meditating
or
perhaps
holding
spirit
communion
with
the
sainted
dead
it
was
discovered
on
the
day
of
golden
leith
burial
that
john
glenalvan
and
his
whole
family
had
secretly
left
the
house
the
night
previous
a
week
later
a
letter
came
from
the
villain
to
bertram
chesleigh
offering
to
sell
glenalvan
hall
on
fair
terms
and
stating
that
he
should
never
live
in
the
south
again
a
bargain
was
closed
at
once
and
bertram
chesleigh
became
the
possessor
of
the
old
hall
which
was
speedily
repaired
and
remodeled
under
the
supervision
of
himself
and
his
lovely
young
wife
before
the
work
was
completed
a
chance
newspaper
chronicled
the
fact
of
a
distressing
railway
accident
and
among
the
list
of
killed
appeared
the
name
of
john
glenalvan
bertram
and
golden
destroyed
the
newspaper
and
old
hugh
never
knew
that
his
wicked
son
had
gone
suddenly
and
without
preparation
into
the
presence
of
his
august
maker
the
old
man
life
flowed
on
in
sweet
serenity
all
his
happiness
was
centered
in
the
living
golden
and
beside
the
grave
of
the
dead
one
while
he
lived
golden
and
her
husband
made
their
home
at
glenalvan
hall
but
after
several
years
of
quiet
peace
the
white
soul
of
the
noble
old
man
took
on
the
wings
of
immortality
and
soared
to
its
heavenly
home
through
the
open
gates
of
the
sunset
they
made
him
a
grave
by
his
daughter
side
and
when
the
grass
was
growing
green
upon
his
grave
they
took
old
dinah
with
them
and
turned
their
faces
northward
black
mammy
had
become
reconciled
to
chesleigh
when
she
saw
how
happy
he
made
her
little
missie
her
kind
and
wrinkled
old
visage
reflected
the
radiant
happiness
that
shone
on
golden
beautiful
face
she
waited
on
her
kindly
and
devotedly
as
ever
declaring
that
no
french
maid
should
ever
take
her
place
while
she
lived
and
golden
with
a
shuddering
remembrance
of
the
wicked
celine
treachery
always
assured
her
old
mammy
that
she
need
never
fear
such
an
intruder
on
her
privileges
the
day
came
when
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
palatial
homes
in
new
york
opened
wide
its
doors
to
receive
bertram
chesleigh
fair
wife
as
its
honored
mistress
though
golden
had
seen
some
of
the
stately
homes
of
new
york
she
was
astonished
at
the
luxury
and
magnificence
of
her
own
chesleigh
smiled
indulgently
at
her
pretty
childish
delight
as
he
led
her
through
suite
after
suite
of
the
sumptuous
luxurious
apartments
the
day
after
their
arrival
i
am
glad
you
are
so
pleased
with
your
new
home
he
said
but
now
my
darling
you
must
run
away
and
let
black
mammy
dress
you
i
have
invited
a
few
guests
to
dinner
strangers
she
asked
with
a
shy
pretty
blush
on
the
exquisite
face
that
was
fresh
and
sweet
as
a
rosebud
with
only
that
pensive
droop
of
the
lashes
to
hint
at
the
sorrow
through
which
she
had
passed
not
exactly
he
replied
with
a
smile
lawyer
leith
and
his
wife
and
desmond
and
little
ruby
i
think
you
will
be
glad
to
see
her
though
she
must
have
tyrannized
over
you
dreadfully
in
the
old
days
a
dear
little
tyrant
she
was
laughed
chesleigh
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
see
her
again
she
went
to
her
and
a
loving
remembrance
of
some
things
the
child
had
said
to
her
once
caused
her
to
choose
a
lovely
dress
of
white
and
blue
with
large
gleaming
white
pearls
for
her
neck
and
wrists
and
knots
of
violets
fastened
among
her
creamy
laces
bertram
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
when
she
came
to
him
in
the
in
the
beautiful
dress
with
the
golden
curls
framing
the
perfect
face
in
a
halo
of
light
she
looked
beyond
him
and
saw
her
father
and
his
wife
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
wonder
and
she
sprang
joyfully
to
their
embrace
leith
released
her
after
some
words
of
love
and
praise
and
she
saw
her
husband
sister
by
her
side
desmond
had
grown
more
brilliantly
lovely
than
ever
happiness
and
contentment
had
lent
new
radiance
to
the
lovely
face
but
there
was
a
wistful
air
almost
amounting
to
humility
about
her
as
she
extended
her
jeweled
hand
and
said
sweetly
my
dear
little
sister
can
you
ever
forgive
me
freely
she
said
clasping
the
offered
hand
and
proffering
the
kiss
of
peace
and
me
too
i
am
deeply
repentant
said
a
low
voice
beside
desmond
and
looking
up
golden
saw
desmond
debonairly
handsome
as
ever
but
so
humble
and
ashamed
that
even
a
harder
heart
than
our
little
golden
must
have
pardoned
his
folly
then
ruby
took
possession
of
her
and
gave
her
a
hug
oh
you
darling
she
cried
i
have
missed
you
so
much
and
to
think
you
were
uncle
bert
wife
all
the
while
it
is
just
like
one
of
mamma
novels
that
she
is
always
reading
i
warn
you
uncle
bert
that
i
shall
make
you
jealous
i
shall
stay
with
her
so
much
and
i
do
so
want
to
see
that
dear
old
black
mammy
i
have
heard
about
her
childish
curiosity
was
gratified
and
the
new
york
child
after
her
first
surprise
grew
very
fond
of
the
old
negress
who
had
been
golden
nurse
from
babyhood
up
i
do
not
have
a
nurse
any
more
she
confided
to
golden
they
have
hired
a
governess
for
me
and
i
like
to
study
it
improves
my
temper
which
was
never
very
bad
smiled
golden
kissing
the
pretty
little
brunette
when
you
go
into
society
you
will
be
surprised
to
meet
elinor
glenalvan
again
desmond
said
to
her
after
awhile
she
has
picked
up
a
rich
old
man
somewhere
and
is
langley
now
six
months
ago
she
burst
upon
society
in
a
blaze
of
glory
and
at
present
she
is
considered
the
handsomest
woman
in
new
york
but
her
star
will
fade
when
you
are
introduced
to
the
social
world
soon
afterward
the
two
cousins
met
at
a
brilliant
reception
both
looked
their
best
elinor
in
ruby
velvet
and
diamonds
golden
in
misty
white
lace
and
pearls
elinor
just
touched
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
the
arm
of
her
decrepit
old
spouse
golden
clung
lovingly
to
her
and
devoted
husband
as
they
passed
each
other
langley
cast
one
look
of
bitter
hatred
and
envy
upon
her
fair
rival
it
was
as
desmond
had
predicted
elinor
star
paled
before
the
superior
loveliness
of
golden
and
in
bitter
anger
and
chagrin
the
eclipsed
beauty
retired
from
the
field
and
removed
to
a
distant
city
where
she
was
seen
and
heard
of
no
more
by
those
who
had
formerly
known
her
little
golden
was
glad
when
her
enemy
was
gone
but
she
felt
no
vanity
over
her
brilliant
social
successes
her
chief
joy
and
pride
was
that
she
reigned
queen
over
her
husband

heart
