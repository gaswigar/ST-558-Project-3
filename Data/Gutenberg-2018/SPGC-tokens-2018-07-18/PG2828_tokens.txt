the
lost
bower
this
is
the
history
of
a
failure
but
the
woman
who
failed
said
that
it
might
be
an
instructive
tale
to
put
into
print
for
the
benefit
of
the
younger
generation
the
younger
generation
does
not
want
instruction
being
perfectly
willing
to
instruct
if
any
one
will
listen
to
it
none
the
less
here
begins
the
story
where
every
story
should
begin
that
is
to
say
at
simla
where
all
things
begin
and
many
come
to
an
evil
end
the
mistake
was
due
to
a
very
clever
woman
making
a
blunder
and
not
retrieving
it
men
are
licensed
to
stumble
but
a
clever
woman
s
mistake
is
outside
the
regular
course
of
nature
and
providence
since
all
good
people
know
that
a
woman
is
the
only
infallible
thing
in
this
world
except
government
paper
of
the
issue
bearing
interest
at
four
and
a
half
per
cent
yet
we
have
to
remember
that
six
consecutive
days
of
rehearsing
the
leading
part
of
the
fallen
angel
at
the
new
gaiety
theatre
where
the
plaster
is
not
yet
properly
dry
might
have
brought
about
an
unhingement
of
spirits
which
again
might
have
led
to
eccentricities
hauksbee
came
to
the
foundry
to
tiffin
with
mallowe
her
one
bosom
friend
for
she
was
in
no
sense
a
woman
s
and
it
was
a
woman
s
tiffin
the
door
shut
to
all
the
world
and
they
both
talked
chiffons
which
is
french
for
mysteries
i
ve
enjoyed
an
interval
of
sanity
hauksbee
announced
after
tiffin
was
over
and
the
two
were
comfortably
settled
in
the
little
that
opened
out
of
mallowe
s
bedroom
my
dear
girl
what
has
he
done
said
mallowe
sweetly
it
is
noticeable
that
ladies
of
a
certain
age
call
each
other
dear
girl
just
as
commissioners
of
years
standing
address
their
equals
in
the
civil
list
as
my
there
s
no
he
in
the
case
who
am
i
that
an
imaginary
man
should
be
always
credited
to
me
am
i
an
apache
no
dear
but
somebody
s
scalp
is
generally
drying
at
your
soaking
this
was
an
allusion
to
the
hawley
boy
who
was
in
the
habit
of
riding
all
across
simla
in
the
rains
to
call
on
hauksbee
that
lady
laughed
for
my
sins
the
aide
at
tyrconnel
last
night
told
me
off
to
the
mussuck
hsh
don
t
laugh
one
of
my
most
devoted
admirers
when
the
duff
came
some
one
really
ought
to
teach
them
to
make
puddings
at
tyrconnel
the
mussuck
was
at
liberty
to
attend
to
sweet
soul
i
know
his
appetite
said
mallowe
did
he
oh
did
he
begin
his
wooing
by
a
special
mercy
of
providence
no
he
explained
his
importance
as
a
pillar
of
the
empire
i
didn
t
lucy
i
don
t
believe
ask
captain
sangar
he
was
on
the
other
side
well
as
i
was
saying
the
mussuck
i
think
i
can
see
him
doing
it
said
mallowe
pensively
scratching
her
s
ears
i
was
properly
impressed
most
properly
i
yawned
openly
strict
supervision
and
play
them
off
one
against
the
other
said
the
mussuck
shovelling
down
his
ice
by
tureenfuls
i
assure
you
that
hauksbee
is
the
secret
of
our
mallowe
laughed
long
and
merrily
and
what
did
you
say
did
you
ever
know
me
at
loss
for
an
answer
yet
i
said
so
i
have
observed
in
my
dealings
with
the
mussuck
swelled
with
pride
he
is
coming
to
call
on
me
the
hawley
boy
is
coming
strict
supervision
and
play
them
off
one
against
the
other
that
hauksbee
is
the
secret
of
our
and
i
daresay
if
we
could
get
to
the
mussuck
s
heart
we
should
find
that
he
considers
himself
a
man
of
the
as
he
is
of
the
other
two
things
i
like
the
mussuck
and
i
won
t
have
you
call
him
names
he
amuses
he
has
reformed
you
too
by
what
appears
explain
the
interval
of
sanity
and
hit
tim
on
the
nose
with
the
please
that
dog
is
too
fond
of
sugar
do
you
take
milk
in
yours
no
thanks
polly
i
m
wearied
of
this
life
it
s
turn
religious
then
i
always
said
that
rome
would
be
your
only
exchanging
attaches
in
red
for
one
in
black
and
if
i
fasted
the
wrinkles
would
come
and
never
never
go
has
it
ever
struck
you
dear
that
i
m
getting
old
thanks
for
your
courtesy
i
ll
return
it
we
are
both
not
exactly
how
shall
i
put
it
what
we
have
been
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
as
crossley
says
polly
i
ve
wasted
my
as
how
never
mind
how
i
feel
it
i
want
to
be
a
power
before
i
be
a
power
then
you
ve
wits
enough
for
anything
and
beauty
hauksbee
pointed
a
teaspoon
straight
at
her
hostess
polly
if
you
heap
compliments
on
me
like
this
i
shall
cease
to
believe
that
you
re
a
woman
tell
me
how
i
am
to
be
a
inform
the
mussuck
that
he
is
the
most
fascinating
and
slimmest
man
in
asia
and
he
ll
tell
you
anything
and
everything
you
bother
the
mussuck
i
mean
an
intellectual
power
not
a
polly
i
m
going
to
start
a
mallowe
turned
lazily
on
the
sofa
and
rested
her
head
on
her
hand
hear
the
words
of
the
preacher
the
son
of
baruch
she
said
will
you
talk
sensibly
i
will
dear
for
i
see
that
you
are
going
to
make
a
i
never
made
a
mistake
in
my
life
at
least
never
one
that
i
couldn
t
explain
away
going
to
make
a
mistake
went
on
mallowe
composedly
it
is
impossible
to
start
a
salon
in
simla
a
bar
would
be
much
more
to
the
perhaps
but
why
it
seems
so
just
what
makes
it
so
difficult
how
many
clever
women
are
there
in
simla
myself
and
yourself
said
hauksbee
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
modest
woman
feardon
would
thank
you
for
that
and
how
many
clever
men
oh
er
hundreds
said
hauksbee
vaguely
what
a
fatal
blunder
not
one
they
are
all
bespoke
by
the
government
take
my
husband
for
instance
jack
was
a
clever
man
though
i
say
so
who
shouldn
t
government
has
eaten
him
up
all
his
ideas
and
powers
of
conversation
he
really
used
to
be
a
good
talker
even
to
his
wife
in
the
old
days
are
taken
from
him
by
this
this
of
a
government
that
s
the
case
with
every
man
up
here
who
is
at
work
i
don
t
suppose
a
russian
convict
under
the
knout
is
able
to
amuse
the
rest
of
his
gang
and
all
our
here
are
gilded
but
there
are
scores
i
know
what
you
re
going
to
say
scores
of
idle
men
up
on
leave
i
admit
it
but
they
are
all
of
two
objectionable
sets
the
civilian
who
d
be
delightful
if
he
had
the
military
man
s
knowledge
of
the
world
and
style
and
the
military
man
who
d
be
adorable
if
he
had
the
civilian
s
detestable
word
have
civilians
culchaw
i
never
studied
the
breed
don
t
make
fun
of
jack
s
service
yes
they
re
like
the
teapoys
in
the
lakka
bazar
good
material
but
not
polished
they
can
t
help
themselves
poor
dears
a
civilian
only
begins
to
be
tolerable
after
he
has
knocked
about
the
world
for
fifteen
and
a
military
man
when
he
has
had
the
same
amount
of
service
the
young
of
both
species
are
horrible
you
would
have
scores
of
them
in
your
i
would
not
said
hauksbee
fiercely
i
would
tell
the
bearer
to
darwaza
band
them
i
d
put
their
own
colonels
and
commissioners
at
the
door
to
turn
them
away
i
d
give
them
to
the
topsham
girl
to
play
the
topsham
girl
would
be
grateful
for
the
gift
but
to
go
back
to
the
salon
allowing
that
you
had
gathered
all
your
men
and
women
together
what
would
you
do
with
them
make
them
talk
they
would
all
with
one
accord
begin
to
flirt
your
salon
would
become
a
glorified
peliti
s
a
scandal
point
by
there
s
a
certain
amount
of
wisdom
in
that
there
s
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
in
it
surely
twelve
simla
seasons
ought
to
have
taught
you
that
you
can
t
focus
anything
in
india
and
a
salon
to
be
any
good
at
all
must
be
permanent
in
two
seasons
your
roomful
would
be
scattered
all
over
asia
we
are
only
little
bits
of
dirt
on
the
hillsides
here
one
day
and
blown
down
the
road
the
next
we
have
lost
the
art
of
talking
at
least
our
men
have
we
have
no
george
eliot
in
the
flesh
interpolated
hauksbee
wickedly
and
collectively
my
dear
scoffer
we
men
and
women
alike
have
no
influence
come
into
the
verandah
and
look
at
the
mall
the
two
looked
down
on
the
now
rapidly
filling
road
for
all
simla
was
abroad
to
steal
a
stroll
between
a
shower
and
a
fog
how
do
you
propose
to
fix
that
river
look
there
s
the
mussuck
head
of
goodness
knows
what
he
is
a
power
in
the
land
though
he
does
eat
like
a
costermonger
there
s
colonel
blone
and
general
grucher
and
sir
dugald
delane
and
sir
henry
haughton
and
jellalatty
all
heads
of
departments
and
all
and
all
my
fervent
admirers
said
hauksbee
piously
sir
henry
haughton
raves
about
me
but
go
one
by
one
these
men
are
worth
something
collectively
they
re
just
a
mob
of
who
cares
for
what
say
your
salon
won
t
weld
the
departments
together
and
make
you
mistress
of
india
dear
and
these
creatures
won
t
talk
administrative
shop
in
a
crowd
your
salon
because
they
are
so
afraid
of
the
men
in
the
lower
ranks
overhearing
it
they
have
forgotten
what
of
literature
and
art
they
ever
knew
and
the
women
can
t
talk
about
anything
except
the
last
gymkhana
or
the
sins
of
their
last
nurse
i
was
calling
on
derwills
this
you
admit
that
they
can
talk
to
the
subalterns
though
and
the
subalterns
can
talk
to
them
your
salon
would
suit
their
views
admirably
if
you
respected
the
religious
prejudices
of
the
country
and
provided
plenty
of
kala
plenty
of
kala
juggahs
oh
my
poor
little
idea
kala
juggahs
in
a
salon
but
who
made
you
so
awfully
clever
perhaps
i
ve
tried
myself
or
perhaps
i
know
a
woman
who
has
i
have
preached
and
expounded
the
whole
matter
and
the
conclusion
you
needn
t
go
on
is
polly
i
thank
you
these
vermin
hauksbee
waved
her
hand
from
the
verandah
to
two
men
in
the
crowd
below
who
had
raised
their
hats
to
her
these
vermin
shall
not
rejoice
in
a
new
scandal
point
or
an
extra
peliti
s
i
will
abandon
the
notion
of
a
salon
it
did
seem
so
tempting
though
but
what
shall
i
do
i
must
do
why
are
not
abana
and
jack
has
made
you
nearly
as
bad
as
himself
i
want
to
of
course
i
m
tired
of
everything
and
everybody
from
a
moonlight
picnic
at
seepee
to
the
blandishments
of
the
yes
that
comes
too
sooner
or
later
have
you
nerve
enough
to
make
your
bow
yet
hauksbee
s
mouth
shut
grimly
then
she
laughed
i
think
i
see
myself
doing
it
big
pink
placards
on
the
mall
mrs
hauksbee
positively
her
last
appearance
on
any
stage
this
is
to
give
notice
no
more
dances
no
more
rides
no
more
luncheons
no
more
theatricals
with
supper
to
follow
no
more
sparring
with
one
s
dearest
dearest
friend
no
more
fencing
with
an
inconvenient
man
who
hasn
t
wit
enough
to
clothe
what
he
s
pleased
to
call
his
sentiments
in
passable
speech
no
more
parading
of
the
mussuck
while
tarkass
calls
all
round
simla
spreading
horrible
stories
about
me
no
more
of
anything
that
is
thoroughly
wearying
abominable
and
detestable
but
all
the
same
makes
life
worth
the
having
yes
i
see
it
all
don
t
interrupt
polly
i
m
inspired
a
mauve
and
white
striped
cloud
round
my
excellent
shoulders
a
seat
in
the
fifth
row
of
the
gaiety
and
both
horses
sold
delightful
vision
a
comfortable
situated
in
three
different
draughts
at
every
and
nice
large
sensible
shoes
for
all
the
couples
to
stumble
over
as
they
go
into
the
verandah
then
at
supper
can
t
you
imagine
the
scene
the
greedy
mob
gone
away
reluctant
subaltern
pink
all
over
like
a
baby
they
really
ought
to
tan
subalterns
before
they
are
exported
polly
sent
back
by
the
hostess
to
do
his
duty
slouches
up
to
me
across
the
room
tugging
at
a
glove
two
sizes
too
large
for
him
i
hate
a
man
who
wears
gloves
like
overcoats
and
trying
to
look
as
if
he
d
thought
of
it
from
the
first
may
i
the
pleasure
f
takin
you
nt
supper
then
i
get
up
with
a
hungry
smile
just
like
lucy
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
and
sweep
out
on
his
arm
so
after
supper
i
shall
go
away
early
you
know
because
i
shall
be
afraid
of
catching
cold
no
one
will
look
for
my
rickshaw
mine
so
please
you
i
shall
stand
always
with
that
mauve
and
white
cloud
over
my
head
while
the
wet
soaks
into
my
dear
old
venerable
feet
and
tom
swears
and
shouts
for
the
s
gharri
then
home
to
bed
at
eleven
truly
excellent
life
helped
out
by
the
visits
of
the
padri
just
fresh
from
burying
somebody
down
below
she
pointed
through
the
pines
toward
the
cemetery
and
continued
with
vigorous
dramatic
gesture
listen
i
see
it
all
down
down
even
to
the
stays
such
stays
a
pair
polly
with
red
flannel
or
list
is
it
that
they
put
into
the
tops
of
those
fearful
things
i
can
draw
you
a
picture
of
lucy
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
go
waving
your
arms
about
in
that
idiotic
manner
recollect
every
one
can
see

from
the
let
them

think

rehearsing
for

mussuck
how
badly

blew
a
kiss
to
the
venerable
indian
administrator
with
infinite
grace
now
she
continued
he
ll
be
chaffed
about
that
at
the
club
in
the
delicate
manner
those
brutes
of
men
affect
and
the
hawley
boy
will
tell
me
all
about
it
softening
the
details
for
fear
of
shocking
me
that
boy
is
too
good
to
live
polly
i
ve
serious
thoughts
of
recommending
him
to
throw
up
his
commission
and
go
into
the
church
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
would
obey

an
affectation
of
indignation

not
offer
hauksbee
any
pity
or
ask
her
to
lie
down
but
gave
her
another
cup
of
tea
and
went
on
with
the
talk
i
ve
been
through
that
too
dear
she
said
i
remember
said
hauksbee
a
gleam
of
fun
on
her
face
in
wasn
t
it
you
went
out
a
great
deal
less
next
mallowe
smiled
in
a
superior
and
fashion
i
became
an
influence
said
she
good
gracious
child
you
didn
t
join
the
theosophists
and
kiss
buddha
s
big
toe
did
you
i
tried
to
get
into
their
set
once
but
they
cast
me
out
for
a
sceptic
without
a
chance
of
improving
my
poor
little
mind
no
i
didn
t
theosophilander
jack
says
never
mind
jack
what
a
husband
says
is
known
before
what
did
you
do
i
made
a
lasting
so
have
i
for
four
months
but
that
didn
t
console
me
in
the
least
i
hated
the
man
will
you
stop
smiling
in
that
inscrutable
way
and
tell
me
what
you
mean
mallowe
told
and
you
mean
to
say
that
it
is
absolutely
platonic
on
both
sides
absolutely
or
i
should
never
have
taken
it
and
his
last
promotion
was
due
to
you
mallowe
nodded
and
you
warned
him
against
the
topsham
girl
another
nod
and
told
him
of
sir
dugald
delane
s
private
memo
about
him
a
third
nod
why
what
a
question
to
ask
a
woman
because
it
amused
me
at
first
i
am
proud
of
my
property
now
if
i
live
he
shall
continue
to
be
successful
yes
i
will
put
him
upon
the
straight
road
to
knighthood
and
everything
else
that
a
man
values
the
rest
depends
upon
polly
you
are
a
most
extraordinary
not
in
the
least
i
m
concentrated
that
s
all
you
diffuse
yourself
dear
and
though
all
simla
knows
your
skill
in
managing
a
can
t
you
choose
a
prettier
word
team
of
from
the
mussuck
to
the
hawley
boy
you
gain
nothing
by
it
not
even
and
you
try
my
recipe
take
a
man
not
a
boy
mind
but
an
almost
mature
unattached
man
and
be
his
guide
philosopher
and
friend
you
ll
find
it
the
most
interesting
occupation
that
you
ever
embarked
on
it
can
be
done
you
needn
t
look
like
that
because
i
ve
done
there
s
an
element
of
risk
about
it
that
makes
the
notion
attractive
i
ll
get
such
a
man
and
say
to
him
now
understand
that
there
must
be
no
flirtation
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
profit
by
my
instruction
and
counsels
and
all
will
yet
be
is
that
the
idea
more
or
less
said
mallowe
with
an
unfathomable
smile
but
be
sure
he
ii
what
a
lot
of
raw
dust
my
dollie
s
had
an
accident
and
out
came
all
the
sawdust
nursery
rhyme
so
hauksbee
in
the
foundry
which
overlooks
simla
mall
sat
at
the
feet
of
mallowe
and
gathered
wisdom
the
end
of
the
conference
was
the
great
idea
upon
which
hauksbee
so
plumed
herself
i
warn
you
said
mallowe
beginning
to
repent
of
her
suggestion
that
the
matter
is
not
half
so
easy
as
it
looks
any
woman
even
the
topsham
girl
can
catch
a
man
but
very
very
few
know
how
to
manage
him
when
my
child
was
the
answer
i
ve
been
a
female
simon
stylites
looking
down
upon
men
for
these
these
years
past
ask
the
mussuck
whether
i
can
manage
hauksbee
departed
humming
i
ll
go
to
him
and
say
to
him
in
manner
most
mallowe
laughed
to
herself
then
she
grew
suddenly
sober
i
wonder
whether
i
ve
done
well
in
advising
that
amusement
lucy
s
a
clever
woman
but
a
thought
too
a
week
later
the
two
met
at
a
monday
pop
well
said
mallowe
i
ve
caught
him
said
hauksbee
her
eyes
were
dancing
with
merriment
who
is
it
mad
woman
i
m
sorry
i
ever
spoke
to
you
about
look
between
the
pillars
in
the
third
row
fourth
from
the
end
you
can
see
his
face
now
look
otis
yeere
of
all
the
improbable
and
impossible
people
i
don
t
believe
hsh
wait
till
tarkass
begins
murdering
milton
wellings
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
that
woman
s
voice
always
reminds
me
of
an
underground
train
coming
into
earl
s
court
with
the
brakes
on
now
listen
it
is
really
otis
so
i
see
but
does
it
follow
that
he
is
your
property
he
is
by
right
of
trove
i
found
him
lonely
and
unbefriended
the
very
next
night
after
our
talk
at
the
dugald
delanes
i
liked
his
eyes
and
i
talked
to
him
next
day
he
called
next
day
we
went
for
a
ride
together
and
he
s
tied
to
my
hand
and
foot
you
ll
see
when
the
concert
s
over
he
doesn
t
know
i
m
here
thank
goodness
you
haven
t
chosen
a
boy
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
assuming
that
you
ve
got
him
assuming
indeed
does
a
woman
do
i
ever
make
a
mistake
in
that
sort
of
thing
first
hauksbee
ticked
off
the
items
ostentatiously
on
her
little
gloved
fingers
first
my
dear
i
shall
dress
him
properly
at
present
his
raiment
is
a
disgrace
and
he
wears
a
like
a
crumpled
sheet
of
the
pioneer
secondly
after
i
have
made
him
presentable
i
shall
form
his
manners
his
morals
are
above
you
seem
to
have
discovered
a
great
deal
about
him
considering
the
shortness
of
your
surely
you
ought
to
know
that
the
first
proof
a
man
gives
of
his
interest
in
a
woman
is
by
talking
to
her
about
his
own
sweet
self
if
the
woman
listens
without
yawning
he
begins
to
like
her
if
she
flatters
the
animal
s
vanity
he
ends
by
adoring
in
some
never
mind
the
exceptions
i
know
which
one
you
are
thinking
of
thirdly
and
lastly
after
he
is
polished
and
made
pretty
i
shall
as
you
said
be
his
guide
philosopher
and
friend
and
he
shall
become
a
success
as
great
a
success
as
your
friend
i
always
wondered
how
that
man
got
on
did
the
mussuck
come
to
you
with
the
civil
list
and
dropping
on
one
knee
no
two
knees
a
la
gibbon
hand
it
to
you
and
say
adorable
angel
choose
your
friend
s
appointment
lucy
your
long
experiences
of
the
military
department
have
demoralised
you
one
doesn
t
do
that
sort
of
thing
on
the
civil
no
disrespect
meant
to
jack
s
service
my
dear
i
only
asked
for
information
give
me
three
months
and
see
what
changes
i
shall
work
in
my
go
your
own
way
since
you
must
but
i
m
sorry
that
i
was
weak
enough
to
suggest
the
i
am
all
discretion
and
may
be
trusted
to
an
extent
quoted
hauksbee
from
the
fallen
angel
and
the
conversation
ceased
with
tarkass
s
last
her
bitterest
enemies
and
she
had
many
could
hardly
accuse
hauksbee
of
wasting
her
time
otis
yeere
was
one
of
those
wandering
dumb
characters
foredoomed
through
life
to
be
nobody
s
property
ten
years
in
her
majesty
s
bengal
civil
service
spent
for
the
most
part
in
undesirable
districts
had
given
him
little
to
be
proud
of
and
nothing
to
bring
confidence
old
enough
to
have
lost
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
that
showers
on
the
immature
stunt
imaginary
commissionerships
and
stars
and
sends
him
into
the
collar
with
coltish
earnestness
and
abandon
too
young
to
be
yet
able
to
look
back
upon
the
progress
he
had
made
and
thank
providence
that
under
the
conditions
of
the
day
he
had
come
even
so
far
he
stood
upon
the
of
his
career
and
when
a
man
stands
still
he
feels
the
slightest
impulse
from
without
fortune
had
ruled
that
otis
yeere
should
be
for
the
first
part
of
his
service
one
of
the
rank
and
file
who
are
ground
up
in
the
wheels
of
the
administration
losing
heart
and
soul
and
mind
and
strength
in
the
process
until
steam
replaces
manual
power
in
the
working
of
the
empire
there
must
always
be
this
percentage
must
always
be
the
men
who
are
used
up
expended
in
the
mere
mechanical
routine
for
these
promotion
is
far
off
and
the
of
every
day
very
instant
the
secretariats
know
them
only
by
name
they
are
not
the
picked
men
of
the
districts
with
divisions
and
collectorates
awaiting
them
they
are
simply
the
rank
and
file
the
food
for
fever
sharing
with
the
ryot
and
the
the
honour
of
being
the
plinth
on
which
the
state
rests
the
older
ones
have
lost
their
aspirations
the
younger
are
putting
theirs
aside
with
a
sigh
both
learn
to
endure
patiently
until
the
end
of
the
day
twelve
years
in
the
rank
and
file
men
say
will
sap
the
hearts
of
the
bravest
and
dull
the
wits
of
the
most
keen
out
of
this
life
otis
yeere
had
fled
for
a
few
months
drifting
in
the
hope
of
a
little
masculine
society
into
simla
when
his
leave
was
over
he
would
return
to
his
swampy
bengal
district
to
the
native
assistant
the
native
doctor
the
native
magistrate
the
steaming
sweltering
station
the
city
and
the
undisguised
insolence
of
the
municipality
that
babbled
away
the
lives
of
men
life
was
cheap
however
the
soil
spawned
humanity
as
it
bred
frogs
in
the
rains
and
the
gap
of
the
sickness
of
one
season
was
filled
to
overflowing
by
the
fecundity
of
the
next
otis
was
unfeignedly
thankful
to
lay
down
his
work
for
a
little
while
and
escape
from
the
seething
whining
weakly
hive
impotent
to
help
itself
but
strong
in
its
power
to
cripple
thwart
and
annoy
the
sunkeneyed
man
who
by
official
irony
was
said
to
be
in
charge
of
it
i
knew
there
were
in
bengal
they
come
up
here
sometimes
but
i
didn
t
know
that
there
were
then
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
otis
yeere
that
his
clothes
wore
rather
the
mark
of
the
ages
it
will
be
seen
that
his
friendship
with
hauksbee
had
made
great
strides
as
that
lady
truthfully
says
a
man
is
never
so
happy
as
when
he
is
talking
about
himself
from
otis
yeere
s
lips
hauksbee
before
long
learned
everything
that
she
wished
to
know
about
the
subject
of
her
experiment
learned
what
manner
of
life
he
had
led
in
what
she
vaguely
called
those
awful
cholera
districts
learned
too
but
this
knowledge
came
later
what
manner
of
life
he
had
purposed
to
lead
and
what
dreams
he
had
dreamed
in
the
year
of
grace
before
the
reality
had
knocked
the
heart
out
of
him
very
pleasant
are
the
shady
round
prospect
hill
for
the
telling
of
such
confidences
not
yet
said
hauksbee
to
maliowe
not
yet
i
must
wait
until
the
man
is
properly
dressed
at
least
great
heavens
is
it
possible
that
he
doesn
t
know
what
an
honour
it
is
to
be
taken
up
by
me
hauksbee
did
not
reckon
false
modesty
as
one
of
her
failings
always
with
hauksbee
murmured
mallowe
with
her
sweetest
smile
to
otis
oh
you
men
you
men
here
are
our
punjabis
growling
because
you
ve
monopolised
the
nicest
woman
in
simla
they
ll
tear
you
to
pieces
on
the
mall
some
day
mallowe
rattled
downhill
having
satisfied
herself
by
a
glance
through
the
fringe
of
her
sunshade
of
the
effect
of
her
words
the
shot
went
home
of
a
surety
otis
yeere
was
somebody
in
this
bewildering
whirl
of
simla
had
monopolised
the
nicest
woman
in
it
and
the
punjabis
were
growling
the
notion
justified
a
mild
glow
of
vanity
he
had
never
looked
upon
his
acquaintance
with
hauksbee
as
a
matter
for
general
interest
the
knowledge
of
envy
was
a
pleasant
feeling
to
the
man
of
no
account
it
was
intensified
later
in
the
day
when
a
luncher
at
the
club
said
spitefully
well
for
a
debilitated
ditcher
yeere
you
are
going
it
hasn
t
any
kind
friend
told
you
that
she
s
the
most
dangerous
woman
in
simla
yeere
chuckled
and
passed
out
when
oh
when
would
his
new
clothes
be
ready
he
descended
into
the
mall
to
inquire
and
hauksbee
coming
over
the
church
ridge
in
her
rickshaw
looked
down
upon
him
approvingly
he
s
learning
to
carry
himself
as
if
he
were
a
man
instead
of
a
piece
of
furniture
and
she
screwed
up
her
eyes
to
see
the
better
through
the
sunlight
he
is
a
man
when
he
holds
himself
like
that
o
blessed
conceit
what
should
we
be
without
you
with
the
new
clothes
came
a
new
stock
of
otis
yeere
discovered
that
he
could
enter
a
room
without
breaking
into
a
gentle
perspiration
could
cross
one
even
to
talk
to
hauksbee
as
though
rooms
were
meant
to
be
crossed
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
nine
years
proud
of
himself
and
contented
with
his
life
satisfied
with
his
new
clothes
and
rejoicing
in
the
friendship
of
hauksbee
conceit
is
what
the
poor
fellow
wants
she
said
in
confidence
to
mallowe
i
believe
they
must
use
civilians
to
plough
the
fields
with
in
lower
bengal
you
see
i
have
to
begin
from
the
very
beginning
haven
t
i
but
you
ll
admit
won
t
you
dear
that
he
is
immensely
improved
since
i
took
him
in
hand
only
give
me
a
little
more
time
and
he
won
t
know
indeed
yeere
was
rapidly
beginning
to
forget
what
he
had
been
one
of
his
own
rank
and
file
put
the
matter
brutally
when
he
asked
yeere
in
reference
to
nothing
and
who
has
been
making
you
a
member
of
council
lately
you
carry
the
side
of
of
i
i
m
awf
ly
sorry
i
didn
t
mean
it
you
know
said
yeere
apologetically
there
ll
be
no
holding
you
continued
the
old
stager
grimly
climb
down
otis
climb
down
and
get
all
that
beastly
affectation
knocked
out
of
you
with
fever
three
thousand
a
month
wouldn
t
support
yeere
repeated
the
incident
to
hauksbee
he
had
come
to
look
upon
her
as
his
mother
confessor
and
you
apologised
she
said
oh
shame
i
hate
a
man
who
apologises
never
apologise
for
what
your
friend
called
never
it
s
a
man
s
business
to
be
insolent
and
overbearing
until
he
meets
with
a
stronger
now
you
bad
boy
listen
to
simply
and
straightforwardly
as
the
rickshaw
loitered
round
jakko
hauksbee
preached
to
otis
yeere
the
great
gospel
of
conceit
illustrating
it
with
living
pictures
encountered
during
their
sunday
afternoon
stroll
good
gracious
she
ended
with
the
personal
argument
you
ll
apologise
next
for
being
my
attache
never
said
otis
yeere
that
s
another
thing
altogether
i
shall
always
what
s
coming
thought
hauksbee
proud
of
that
said
otis
safe
for
the
present
she
said
to
herself
but
i
m
afraid
i
have
grown
conceited
like
jeshurun
you
know
when
he
waxed
fat
then
he
kicked
it
s
the
having
no
worry
on
one
s
mind
and
the
hill
air
i
hill
air
indeed
said
hauksbee
to
herself
he
d
have
been
hiding
in
the
club
till
the
last
day
of
his
leave
if
i
hadn
t
discovered
and
aloud
why
shouldn
t
you
be
you
have
every
right
i
why
oh
hundreds
of
things
i
m
not
going
to
waste
this
lovely
afternoon
by
explaining
but
i
know
you
have
what
was
that
heap
of
manuscript
you
showed
me
about
the
grammar
of
the
aboriginal
what
s
their
names
gullals
a
piece
of
nonsense
i
ve
far
too
much
work
to
do
to
bother
over
gullals
now
you
should
see
my
district
come
down
with
your
husband
some
day
and
i
ll
show
you
round
such
a
lovely
place
in
the
rains
a
sheet
of
water
with
the
and
the
snakes
sticking
out
and
in
the
summer
green
flies
and
green
squash
the
people
would
die
of
fear
if
you
shook
a

at

but
they
know
you
re
forbidden
to
do
that
so
they
conspire
to
make
your
life
a
burden
to
you
my
district
s
worked
by
some
man
at
darjiling
on
the
strength
of
a
native
pleader
s
false
reports
oh
it
s
a
heavenly
place
otis
yeere
laughed
bitterly
there
s
not
the
least
necessity
that
you
should
stay
in
it
why
do
you
because
i
must
how
m
i
to
get
out
of
it
how
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
ways
if
there
weren
t
so
many
people
on
the
road
i
d
like
to
box
your
ears
ask
my
dear
boy
ask
look
there
is
young
hexarly
with
six
years
service
and
half
your
talents
he
asked
for
what
he
wanted
and
he
got
it
see
down
by
the
convent
there
s
mcarthurson
who
has
come
to
his
present
position
by
asking
sheer
downright
asking
after
he
had
pushed
himself
out
of
the
rank
and
file
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
in
your
service
believe
me
i
ve
seen
simla
for
more
seasons
than
i
care
to
think
about
do
you
suppose
men
are
chosen
for
appointments
because
of
their
special
fitness
beforehand
you
have
all
passed
a
high
test
what
do
you
call
it
in
the
beginning
and
except
for
the
few
who
have
gone
altogether
to
the
bad
you
can
all
work
hard
asking
does
the
rest
call
it
cheek
call
it
insolence
call
it
anything
you
like
but
ask
men
argue
yes
i
know
what
men
say
that
a
man
by
the
mere
audacity
of
his
request
must
have
some
good
in
him
a
weak
man
doesn
t
say
give
me
this
and
he
whines
why
haven
t
i
been
given
this
and
that
if
you
were
in
the
army
i
should
say
learn
to
spin
plates
or
play
a
tambourine
with
your
toes
as
it
is
ask
you
belong
to
a
service
that
ought
to
be
able
to
command
the
channel
fleet
or
set
a
leg
at
twenty
minutes
notice
and
yet
you
hesitate
over
asking
to
escape
from
a
squashy
green
district
where
you
admit
you
are
not
master
drop
the
bengal
government
altogether
even
darjiling
is
a
little
hole
i
was
there
once
and
the
rents
were
extortionate
assert
yourself
get
the
government
of
india
to
take
you
over
try
to
get
on
the
frontier
where
every
man
has
a
grand
chance
if
he
can
trust
himself
go
somewhere
do
something
you
have
twice
the
wits
and
three
times
the
presence
of
the
men
up
here
and
and
hauksbee
paused
for
breath
then
continued
and
in
any
way
you
look
at
it
you
ought
to
you
who
could
go
so
far
i
don
t
know
said
yeere
rather
taken
aback
by
the
unexpected
eloquence
i
haven
t
such
a
good
opinion
of
it
was
not
strictly
platonic
but
it
was
policy
hauksbee
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
the
ungloved
paw
that
rested
on
the
rickshaw
hood
and
looking
the
man
full
in
the
face
said
tenderly
almost
too
tenderly
i
believe
in
you
if
you
mistrust
yourself
is
that
enough
my
friend
it
is
enough
answered
otis
very
solemnly
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
redreaming
the
dreams
that
he
had
dreamed
eight
years
ago
but
through
them
all
ran
as
through
golden
cloud
the
light
of
hauksbee
s
violet
eyes
curious
and
impenetrable
are
the
mazes
of
simla
life
the
only
existence
in
this
desolate
land
worth
the
living
gradually
it
went
abroad
among
men
and
women
in
the
pauses
between
dance
play
and
gymkhana
that
otis
yeere
the
man
with
the
light
of
in
his
eyes
had
done
something
decent
in
the
wilds
whence
he
came
he
had
brought
an
erring
municipality
to
reason
appropriated
the
funds
on
his
own
responsibility
and
saved
the
lives
of
hundreds
he
knew
more
about
the
gullals
than
any
living
man
had
a
vast
knowledge
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
was
in
spite
of
his
juniority
the
greatest
authority
on
the
aboriginal
gullals
no
one
quite
knew
who
or
what
the
gullals
were
till
the
mussuck
who
had
been
calling
on
hauksbee
and
prided
himself
upon
picking
people
s
brains
explained
they
were
a
tribe
of
ferocious
hillmen
somewhere
near
sikkim
whose
friendship
even
the
great
indian
empire
would
find
it
worth
her
while
to
secure
now
we
know
that
otis
yeere
had
showed
hauksbee
his
notes
of
six
years
standing
on
these
same
gullals
he
had
told
her
too
how
sick
and
shaken
with
the
fever
their
negligence
had
bred
crippled
by
the
loss
of
his
pet
clerk
and
savagely
angry
at
the
desolation
in
his
charge
he
had
once
damned
the
collective
eyes
of
his
intelligent
local
board
for
a
set
of
haramzadas
which
act
of
brutal
and
tyrannous
oppression
won
him
a
reprimand
royal
from
the
bengal
government
but
in
the
anecdote
as
amended
for
northern
consumption
we
find
no
record
of
this
hence
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
hauksbee
edited
his
reminiscences
before
sowing
them
in
idle
ears
ready
as
she
well
knew
to
exaggerate
good
or
evil
and
otis
yeere
bore
himself
as
befitted
the
hero
of
many
tales
you
can
talk
to
me
when
you
don
t
fall
into
a
brown
study
talk
now
and
talk
your
brightest
and
best
said
hauksbee
otis
needed
no
spur
look
to
a
man
who
has
the
counsel
of
a
woman
of
or
above
the
world
to
back
him
so
long
as
he
keeps
his
head
he
can
meet
both
sexes
on
equal
ground
an
advantage
never
intended
by
providence
who
fashioned
man
on
one
day
and
woman
on
another
in
sign
that
neither
should
know
more
than
a
very
little
of
the
other
s
life
such
a
man
goes
far
or
the
counsel
being
withdrawn
collapses
suddenly
while
his
world
seeks
the
reason
generalled
by
hauksbee
who
again
had
all
mallowe
s
wisdom
at
her
disposal
proud
of
himself
and
in
the
end
believing
in
himself
because
he
was
believed
in
otis
yeere
stood
ready
for
any
fortune
that
might
befall
certain
that
it
would
be
good
he
would
fight
for
his
own
hand
and
intended
that
this
second
struggle
should
lead
to
better
issue
than
the
first
helpless
surrender
of
the
bewildered
stunt
what
might
have
happened
it
is
impossible
to
say
this
lamentable
thing
befell
bred
directly
by
a
statement
of
hauksbee
that
she
would
spend
the
next
season
in
darjiling
are
you
certain
of
that
said
otis
yeere
quite
we
re
writing
about
a
house
otis
yeere
stopped
dead
as
hauksbee
put
it
in
discussing
the
relapse
with
mallowe
he
has
behaved
she
said
angrily
just
like
captain
kerrington
s
pony
only
otis
is
a
donkey
at
the
last
gymkhana
planted
his
forefeet
and
refused
to
go
on
another
step
polly
my
man
s
going
to
disappoint
me
what
shall
i
do
as
a
rule
mallowe
does
not
approve
of
staring
but
on
this
occasion
she
opened
her
eyes
to
the
utmost
you
have
managed
cleverly
so
far
she
said
speak
to
him
and
ask
him
what
he
i
will
at
s
no
o
not
at
a
dance
said
mallowe
cautiously
men
are
never
themselves
quite
at
dances
better
wait
till
nonsense
if
he
s
going
to
vert
in
this
insane
way
there
isn
t
a
day
to
lose
are
you
going
no
then
sit
up
for
me
there
s
a
dear
i
shan
t
stay
longer
than
supper
under
any
mallowe
waited
through
the
evening
looking
long
and
earnestly
into
the
fire
and
sometimes
smiling
to
herself
oh
oh
oh
the
man
s
an
idiot
a
raving
positive
idiot
i
m
sorry
i
ever
saw
him
hauksbee
burst
into
mallowe
s
house
at
midnight
almost
in
tears
what
in
the
world
has
happened
said
mallowe
but
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
guessed
an
answer
happened
everything
has
happened
he
was
there
i
went
to
him
and
said
now
what
does
this
nonsense
mean
don
t
laugh
dear
i
can
t
bear
it
but
you
know
what
i
mean
i
said
then
it
was
a
square
and
i
sat
it
out
with
him
and
wanted
an
explanation
and
he
said
oh
i
haven
t
patience
with
such
idiots
you
know
what
i
said
about
going
to
darjiling
next
year
it
doesn
t
matter
to
me
where
i
go
i
d
have
changed
the
station
and
lost
the
rent
to
have
saved
this
he
said
in
so
many
words
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
try
to
work
up
any
more
because
because
he
would
be
shifted
into
a
province
away
from
darjiling
and
his
own
district
where
these
creatures
are
is
within
a
day
s
ah
hh
said
mallowe
in
a
tone
of
one
who
has
successfully
tracked
an
obscure
word
through
a
large
dictionary
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
mad
so
absurd
and
he
had
the
ball
at
his
feet
he
had
only
to
kick
it
i
would
have
made
him
anything
anything
in
the
wide
world
he
could
have
gone
to
the
world
s
end
i
would
have
helped
him
i
made
him
didn
t
i
polly
didn
t
i
create
that
man
doesn
t
he
owe
everything
to
me
and
to
reward
me
just
when
everything
was
nicely
arranged
by
this
lunacy
that
spoilt
everything
very
few
men
understand
your
devotion
oh
polly
don
t
laugh
at
me
i
give
men
up
from
this
hour
i
could
have
killed
him
then
and
there
what
right
had
this
man
this
thing
i
had
picked
out
of
his
filthy
paddy
fields
to
make
love
to
me
he
did
that
did
he
he
did
i
don
t
remember
half
he
said
i
was
so
angry
oh
but
such
a
funny
thing
happened
i
can
t
help
laughing
at
it
now
though
i
felt
nearly
ready
to
cry
with
rage
he
raved
and
i
stormed
i
m
afraid
we
must
have
made
an
awful
noise
in
our
kala
juggah
protect
my
character
dear
if
it
s
all
over
simla
by
and
then
he
bobbed
forward
in
the
middle
of
this
insanity
i
firmly
believe
the
man
s
demented
and
kissed
morals
above
reproach
purred
mallowe
so
they
were
so
they
are
it
was
the
most
absurd
kiss
i
don
t
believe
he
d
ever
kissed
a
woman
in
his
life
before
i
threw
my
head
back
and
it
was
a
sort
of
slidy
pecking
dab
just
on
the
end
of
the
chin
hauksbee
tapped
her
masculine
little
chin
with
her
fan
then
of
course
i
was
furiously
angry
and
told
him
that
he
was
no
gentleman
and
i
was
sorry
i
d
ever
met
him
and
so
on
he
was
crushed
so
easily
then
i
couldn
t
be
very
angry
then
i
came
away
straight
to
was
this
before
or
after
supper
oh
before
oceans
before
isn
t
it
perfectly
disgusting
let
me
think
i
withhold
judgment
till
tomorrow
morning
brings
but
morning
brought
only
a
servant
with
a
dainty
bouquet
of
annandale
roses
for
hauksbee
to
wear
at
the
dance
at
viceregal
lodge
that
night
he
doesn
t
seem
to
be
very
penitent
said
mallowe
what
s
the
in
the
centre
hauksbee
opened
the
note
another
accomplishment
that
she
had
taught
otis
read
it
and
groaned
tragically
last
wreck
of
a
feeble
intellect
poetry
is
it
his
own
do
you
think
oh
that
i
ever
built
my
hopes
on
such
a
maudlin
idiot
no
it
s
a
quotation
from
browning
and
in
view
of
the
facts
of
the
case
as
jack
says
uncommonly
well
chosen
listen
sweet
thou
hast
trod
on
a
heart
pass
there
s
a
world
full
of
men
and
women
as
fair
as
thou
art
must
do
such
things
now
and
then
thou
only
hast
stepped
unaware
malice
not
one
can
impute
and
why
should
a
heart
have
been
there
in
the
way
of
a
fair
woman
s
foot
i
didn
t
i
didn
t
i
didn
t
said
hauksbee
angrily
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
there
was
no
malice
at
all
oh
it
s
too
vexatious
you
ve
misunderstood
the
compliment
said
mallowe
he
clears
you
completely
and
ahem
i
should
think
by
this
that
he
has
cleared
completely
too
my
experience
of
men
is
that
when
they
begin
to
quote
poetry
they
are
going
to
flit
like
swans
singing
before
they
die
you
polly
you
take
my
sorrows
in
a
most
unfeeling
do
i
is
it
so
terrible
if
he
s
hurt
your
vanity
i
should
say
that
you
ve
done
a
certain
amount
of
damage
to
his
oh
you
can
never
tell
about
a
man
said
hauksbee
at
the
pit
s
mouth
men
say
it
was
a
stolen
tide
the
lord
that
sent
it
he
knows
all
but
in
mine
ear
will
aye
abide
the
message
that
the
bells
let
fall
and
awesome
bells
they
were
to
me
that
in
the
dark
rang
jean
ingelow
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
man
and
his
wife
and
a
tertium
quid
all
three
were
unwise
but
the
wife
was
the
unwisest
the
man
should
have
looked
after
his
wife
who
should
have
avoided
the
tertium
quid
who
again
should
have
married
a
wife
of
his
own
after
clean
and
open
flirtations
to
which
nobody
can
possibly
object
round
jakko
or
observatory
hill
when
you
see
a
young
man
with
his
pony
in
a
white
lather
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
flying
downhill
at
fifteen
miles
an
hour
to
meet
a
girl
who
will
be
properly
surprised
to
meet
him
you
naturally
approve
of
that
young
man
and
wish
him
staff
appointments
and
take
an
interest
in
his
welfare
and
as
the
proper
time
comes
give
them
or
according
to
your
means
and
generosity
the
tertium
quid
flew
downhill
on
horseback
but
it
was
to
meet
the
man
s
wife
and
when
he
flew
uphill
it
was
for
the
same
end
the
man
was
in
the
plains
earning
money
for
his
wife
to
spend
on
dresses
and
bracelets
and
inexpensive
luxuries
of
that
kind
he
worked
very
hard
and
sent
her
a
letter
or
a
daily
she
also
wrote
to
him
daily
and
said
that
she
was
longing
for
him
to
come
up
to
simla
the
tertium
quid
used
to
lean
over
her
shoulder
and
laugh
as
she
wrote
the
notes
then
the
two
would
ride
to
the
together
now
simla
is
a
strange
place
and
its
customs
are
peculiar
nor
is
any
man
who
has
not
spent
at
least
ten
seasons
there
qualified
to
pass
judgment
on
circumstantial
evidence
which
is
the
most
untrustworthy
in
the
courts
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
which
need
not
appear
i
decline
to
state
positively
whether
there
was
anything
irretrievably
wrong
in
the
relations
between
the
man
s
wife
and
the
tertium
quid
if
there
was
and
hereon
you
must
form
your
own
opinion
it
was
the
man
s
wife
s
fault
she
was
kittenish
in
her
manners
wearing
generally
an
air
of
soft
and
fluffy
innocence
but
she
was
deadlily
learned
and
and
now
and
again
when
the
mask
dropped
men
saw
this
shuddered
and
almost
drew
back
men
are
occasionally
particular
and
the
least
particular
men
are
always
the
most
exacting
simla
is
eccentric
in
its
fashion
of
treating
friendships
certain
attachments
which
have
set
and
crystallised
through
seasons
acquire
almost
the
sanctity
of
the
marriage
bond
and
are
revered
as
such
again
certain
attachments
equally
old
and
to
all
appearance
equally
venerable
never
seem
to
win
any
recognised
official
status
while
a
acquaintance
not
two
months
born
steps
into
the
place
which
by
right
belongs
to
the
senior
there
is
no
law
reducible
to
print
which
regulates
these
affairs
some
people
have
a
gift
which
secures
them
infinite
toleration
and
others
have
not
the
man
s
wife
had
not
if
she
looked
over
the
garden
wall
for
instance
women
taxed
her
with
stealing
their
husbands
she
complained
pathetically
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
choose
her
own
friends
when
she
put
up
her
big
white
muff
to
her
lips
and
gazed
over
it
and
under
her
eyebrows
at
you
as
she
said
this
thing
you
felt
that
she
had
been
infamously
misjudged
and
that
all
the
other
women
s
instincts
were
all
wrong
which
was
absurd
she
was
not
allowed
to
own
the
tertium
quid
in
peace
and
was
so
strangely
constructed
that
she
would
not
have
enjoyed
peace
had
she
been
so
permitted
she
preferred
some
semblance
of
intrigue
to
cloak
even
her
most
commonplace
actions
after
two
months
of
riding
first
round
jakko
then
elysium
then
summer
hill
then
observatory
hill
then
under
jutogh
and
lastly
up
and
down
the
cart
road
as
far
as
the
tara
devi
gap
in
the
dusk
she
said
to
the
tertium
quid
frank
people
say
we
are
too
much
together
and
people
are
so
the
tertium
quid
pulled
his
moustache
and
replied
that
horrid
people
were
unworthy
of
the
consideration
of
nice
people
but
they
have
done
more
than
talk
they
have
written
written
to
my
hubby
i
m
sure
of
it
said
the
man
s
wife
and
she
pulled
a
letter
from
her
husband
out
of
her
and
gave
it
to
the
tertium
quid
it
was
an
honest
letter
written
by
an
honest
man
then
stewing
in
the
plains
on
two
hundred
rupees
a
month
for
he
allowed
his
wife
eight
hundred
and
fifty
and
in
a
silk
banian
and
cotton
trousers
it
said
that
perhaps
she
had
not
thought
of
the
unwisdom
of
allowing
her
name
to
be
so
generally
coupled
with
the
tertium
quid
s
that
she
was
too
much
of
a
child
to
understand
the
dangers
of
that
sort
of
thing
that
he
her
husband
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
interfere
jealously
with
her
little
amusements
and
interests
but
that
it
would
be
better
were
she
to
drop
the
tertium
quid
quietly
and
for
her
husband
s
sake
the
letter
was
sweetened
with
many
pretty
little
pet
names
and
it
amused
the
tertium
quid
considerably
he
and
she
laughed
over
it
so
that
you
fifty
yards
away
could
see
their
shoulders
shaking
while
the
horses
slouched
along
side
by
side
their
conversation
was
not
worth
reporting
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
next
day
no
one
saw
the
man
s
wife
and
the
tertium
quid
together
they
had
both
gone
down
to
the
cemetery
which
as
a
rule
is
only
visited
officially
by
the
inhabitants
of
simla
a
simla
funeral
with
the
clergyman
riding
the
mourners
riding
and
the
coffin
creaking
as
it
swings
between
the
bearers
is
one
of
the
most
depressing
things
on
this
earth
particularly
when
the
procession
passes
under
the
wet
dank
dip
beneath
the
rockcliffe
hotel
where
the
sun
is
shut
out
and
all
the
hill
streams
are
wailing
and
weeping
together
as
they
go
down
the
valleys
occasionally
folk
tend
the
graves
but
we
in
india
shift
and
are
transferred
so
often
that
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
the
dead
have
no
friend
only
acquaintances
who
are
far
too
busy
amusing
themselves
up
the
hill
to
attend
to
old
partners
the
idea
of
using
a
cemetery
as
a
rendezvous
is
distinctly
a
feminine
one
a
man
would
have
said
simply
let
people
talk
we
ll
go
down
the
a
woman
is
made
differently
especially
if
she
be
such
a
woman
as
the
man
s
wife
she
and
the
tertium
quid
enjoyed
each
other
s
society
among
the
graves
of
men
and
women
whom
they
had
known
and
danced
with
aforetime
they
used
to
take
a
big
and
sit
on
the
grass
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
lower
end
where
there
is
a
dip
in
the
ground
and
where
the
occupied
graves
stop
short
and
the
ones
are
not
ready
each
indian
cemetery
keeps
graves
permanently
open
for
contingencies
and
incidental
wear
and
tear
in
the
hills
these
are
more
usually
baby
s
size
because
children
who
come
up
weakened
and
sick
from
the
plains
often
succumb
to
the
effects
of
the
rains
in
the
hills
or
get
pneumonia
from
their
ayahs
taking
them
through
damp
after
the
sun
has
set
in
cantonments
of
course
the
man
s
size
is
more
in
request
these
arrangements
varying
with
the
climate
and
population
one
day
when
the
man
s
wife
and
the
tertium
quid
had
just
arrived
in
the
cemetery
they
saw
some
coolies
breaking
ground
they
had
marked
out
a
grave
and
the
tertium
quid
asked
them
whether
any
sahib
was
sick
they
said
that
they
did
not
know
but
it
was
an
order
that
they
should
dig
a
sahib
s
grave
work
away
said
the
tertium
quid
and
let
s
see
how
it
s
the
coolies
worked
away
and
the
man
s
wife
and
the
tertium
quid
watched
and
talked
for
a
couple
of
hours
while
the
grave
was
being
deepened
then
a
coolie
taking
the
earth
in
baskets
as
it
was
thrown
up
jumped
over
the
grave
that
s
queer
said
the
tertium
quid
where
s
my
ulster
what
s
queer
said
the
man
s
wife
i
have
got
a
chill
down
my
back
just
as
if
a
goose
had
walked
over
my
why
do
you
look
at
the
thing
then
said
the
man
s
wife
let
us
the
tertium
quid
stood
at
the
head
of
the
grave
and
stared
without
answering
for
a
space
then
he
said
dropping
a
pebble
down
it
is
nasty
and
cold
horribly
cold
i
don
t
think
i
shall
come
to
the
cemetery
any
more
i
don
t
think
is
the
two
talked
and
agreed
that
the
cemetery
was
depressing
they
also
arranged
for
a
ride
next
day
out
from
the
cemetery
through
the
mashobra
tunnel
up
to
fagoo
and
back
because
all
the
world
was
going
to
a
at
viceregal
lodge
and
all
the
people
of
mashobra
would
go
too
coming
up
the
cemetery
road
the
tertium
quid
s
horse
tried
to
bolt
uphill
being
tired
with
standing
so
long
and
managed
to
strain
a
back
sinew
i
shall
have
to
take
the
mare
said
the
tertium
quid
and
she
will
stand
nothing
heavier
than
a
they
made
their
arrangements
to
meet
in
the
cemetery
after
allowing
all
the
mashobra
people
time
to
pass
into
simla
that
night
it
rained
heavily
and
next
day
when
the
tertium
quid
came
to
the
he
saw
that
the
new
grave
had
a
foot
of
water
in
it
the
ground
being
a
tough
and
sour
clay
jove
that
looks
beastly
said
the
tertium
quid
fancy
being
boarded
up
and
dropped
into
that
well
they
then
started
off
to
fagoo
the
mare
playing
with
the
snaffle
and
picking
her
way
as
though
she
were
shod
with
satin
and
the
sun
shining
divinely
the
road
below
mashobra
to
fagoo
is
officially
styled
the
road
but
in
spite
of
its
name
it
is
not
much
more
than
six
feet
wide
in
most
places
and
the
drop
into
the
valley
below
may
be
anything
between
one
and
two
thousand
feet
now
we
re
going
to
thibet
said
the
man
s
wife
merrily
as
the
horses
drew
near
to
fagoo
she
was
riding
on
the
into
thibet
said
the
tertium
quid
ever
so
far
from
people
who
say
horrid
things
and
hubbies
who
write
stupid
letters
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
a
coolie
carrying
a
log
of
wood
came
round
a
corner
and
the
mare
went
wide
to
avoid
him
forefeet
in
and
haunches
out
as
a
sensible
mare
should
go
to
the
world
s
end
said
the
man
s
wife
and
looked
unspeakable
things
over
her
near
shoulder
at
the
tertium
quid
he
was
smiling
but
while
she
looked
the
smile
froze
stiff
as
it
were
on
his
face
and
changed
to
a
nervous
grin
the
sort
of
grin
men
wear
when
they
are
not
quite
easy
in
their
saddles
the
mare
seemed
to
be
sinking
by
the
stern
and
her
nostrils
cracked
while
she
was
trying
to
realise
what
was
happening
the
rain
of
the
night
before
had
rotted
the
of
the
road
and
it
was
giving
way
under
her
what
are
you
doing
said
the
man
s
wife
the
tertium
quid
gave
no
answer
he
grinned
nervously
and
set
his
spurs
into
the
mare
who
rapped
with
her
forefeet
on
the
road
and
the
struggle
began
the
man
s
wife
screamed
oh
frank
get
off
but
the
tertium
quid
was
glued
to
the
saddle
his
face
blue
and
white
and
he
looked
into
the
man
s
wife
s
eyes
then
the
man
s
wife
clutched
at
the
mare
s
head
and
caught
her
by
the
nose
instead
of
the
bridle
the
brute
threw
up
her
head
and
went
down
with
a
scream
the
tertium
quid
upon
her
and
the
nervous
grin
still
set
on
his
face
the
man
s
wife
heard
the
of
little
stones
and
loose
earth
falling
off
the
roadway
and
the
sliding
roar
of
the
man
and
horse
going
down
then
everything
was
quiet
and
she
called
on
frank
to
leave
his
mare
and
walk
up
but
frank
did
not
answer
he
was
underneath
the
mare
nine
hundred
feet
below
spoiling
a
patch
of
indian
corn
as
the
revellers
came
back
from
viceregal
lodge
in
the
mists
of
the
evening
they
met
a
temporarily
insane
woman
on
a
temporarily
mad
horse
swinging
round
the
corners
with
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
open
and
her
head
like
the
head
of
a
medusa
she
was
stopped
by
a
man
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
taken
out
of
the
saddle
a
limp
heap
and
put
on
the
bank
to
explain
herself
this
wasted
twenty
minutes
and
then
she
was
sent
home
in
a
lady
s
rickshaw
still
with
her
mouth
open
and
her
hands
picking
at
her
she
was
in
bed
through
the
following
three
days
which
were
rainy
so
she
missed
attending
the
funeral
of
the
tertium
quid
who
was
lowered
into
eighteen
inches
of
water
instead
of
the
twelve
to
which
he
had
first
objected
a
wayside
comedy
because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
judgment
therefore
the
misery
of
man
is
great
upon
him
eccles
viii
fate
and
the
government
of
india
have
turned
the
station
of
kashima
into
a
prison
and
because
there
is
no
help
for
the
poor
souls
who
are
now
lying
there
in
torment
i
write
this
story
praying
that
the
government
of
india
may
be
moved
to
scatter
the
european
population
to
the
four
winds
kashima
is
bounded
on
all
sides
by
the
rocktipped
circle
of
the
dosehri
hills
in
spring
it
is
ablaze
with
roses
in
summer
the
roses
die
and
the
hot
winds
blow
from
the
hills
in
autumn
the
white
mists
from
the
jhils
cover
the
place
as
with
water
and
in
winter
the
frosts
nip
everything
young
and
tender
to
there
is
but
one
view
in
kashima
a
stretch
of
perfectly
flat
pasture
and
running
up
to
the
scrub
of
the
dosehri
hills
there
are
no
amusements
except
snipe
and
tiger
shooting
but
the
tigers
have
been
long
since
hunted
from
their
lairs
in
the
and
the
snipe
only
come
once
a
year
narkarra
one
hundred
and
miles
by
road
is
the
nearest
station
to
kashima
but
kashima
never
goes
to
narkarra
where
there
are
at
least
twelve
english
people
it
stays
within
the
circle
of
the
dosehri
hills
all
kashima
acquits
vansuythen
of
any
intention
to
do
harm
but
all
kashima
knows
that
she
and
she
alone
brought
about
their
pain
boulte
the
engineer
boulte
and
captain
kurrell
know
this
they
are
the
english
population
of
kashima
if
we
except
major
vansuythen
who
is
of
no
importance
whatever
and
vansuythen
who
is
the
most
important
of
all
you
must
remember
though
you
will
not
understand
that
all
laws
weaken
in
a
small
and
hidden
community
where
there
is
no
public
opinion
when
a
man
is
absolutely
alone
in
a
station
he
runs
a
certain
risk
of
falling
into
evil
ways
this
risk
is
multiplied
by
every
addition
to
the
population
up
to
twelve
the
after
that
fear
and
consequent
restraint
begin
and
human
action
becomes
less
grotesquely
jerky
there
was
deep
peace
in
kashima
till
vansuythen
arrived
she
was
a
charming
woman
every
one
said
so
everywhere
and
she
charmed
every
one
in
spite
of
this
or
perhaps
because
of
this
since
fate
is
so
perverse
she
cared
only
for
one
man
and
he
was
major
vansuythen
had
she
been
plain
or
stupid
this
matter
would
have
been
intelligible
to
kashima
but
she
was
a
fair
woman
with
very
still
gray
eyes
the
colour
of
a
lake
just
before
the
light
of
the
sun
touches
it
no
man
who
had
seen
those
eyes
could
later
on
explain
what
fashion
of
woman
she
was
to
look
upon
the
eyes
dazzled
him
her
own
sex
said
that
she
was
not
but
spoilt
by
pretending
to
be
so
and
yet
her
gravity
was
natural
it
was
not
her
habit
to
smile
she
merely
went
through
life
looking
at
those
who
passed
and
the
women
objected
while
the
men
fell
down
and
worshipped
she
knows
and
is
deeply
sorry
for
the
evil
she
has
done
to
kashima
but
major
vansuythen
can
not
understand
why
boulte
does
not
drop
in
to
afternoon
tea
at
least
three
times
a
week
when
there
are
only
two
women
in
one
station
they
ought
to
see
a
great
deal
of
each
other
says
major
vansuythen
long
and
long
before
ever
vansuythen
came
out
of
those
places
where
there
is
society
and
amusement
kurrell
had
discovered
that
boulte
was
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
him
and
you
dare
not
blame
them
kashima
was
as
out
of
the
world
as
heaven
or
the
other
place
and
the
dosehri
hills
kept
their
secret
well
boulte
had
no
concern
in
the
matter
he
was
in
camp
for
a
fortnight
at
a
time
he
was
a
hard
heavy
man
and
neither
boulte
nor
kurrell
pitied
him
they
had
all
kashima
and
each
other
for
their
very
very
own
and
kashima
was
the
garden
of
eden
in
those
days
when
boulte
returned
from
his
wanderings
he
would
slap
kurrell
between
the
shoulders
and
call
him
old
fellow
and
the
three
would
dine
together
kashima
was
happy
then
when
the
judgment
of
god
seemed
almost
as
distant
as
narkarra
or
the
railway
that
ran
down
to
the
sea
but
the
government
sent
major
vansuythen
to
kashima
and
with
him
came
his
wife
the
etiquette
of
kashima
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
a
desert
island
when
a
stranger
is
cast
away
there
all
hands
go
down
to
the
shore
to
make
him
welcome
kashima
assembled
at
the
masonry
platform
close
to
the
narkarra
road
and
spread
tea
for
the
vansuythens
that
ceremony
was
reckoned
a
formal
call
and
made
them
free
of
the
station
its
rights
and
privileges
when
the
vansuythens
settled
down
they
gave
a
tiny
to
all
kashima
and
that
made
kashima
free
of
their
house
according
to
the
immemorial
usage
of
the
station
then
the
rains
came
when
no
one
could
go
into
camp
and
the
narkarra
road
was
washed
away
by
the
kasun
river
and
in
the
pastures
of
kashima
the
cattle
waded
the
clouds
dropped
down
from
the
dosehri
hills
and
covered
everything
at
the
end
of
the
rains
boulte
s
manner
towards
his
wife
changed
and
became
demonstratively
affectionate
they
had
been
married
twelve
years
and
the
change
startled
boulte
who
hated
her
husband
with
the
hate
of
a
woman
who
has
met
with
nothing
but
kindness
from
her
mate
and
in
the
teeth
of
this
kindness
has
done
him
a
great
wrong
moreover
she
had
her
own
trouble
to
fight
with
her
watch
to
keep
over
her
own
property
kurrell
for
two
months
the
rains
had
hidden
the
dosehri
hills
and
many
other
things
besides
but
when
they
lifted
they
showed
boulte
that
her
man
among
men
her
ted
for
she
called
him
ted
in
the
old
days
when
boulte
was
out
of
earshot
was
slipping
the
links
of
the
allegiance
the
vansuythen
woman
has
taken
him
boulte
said
to
herself
and
when
boulte
was
away
wept
over
her
belief
in
the
face
of
the
blandishments
of
ted
sorrow
in
kashima
is
as
fortunate
as
love
because
there
is
nothing
to
weaken
it
save
the
flight
of
time
boulte
had
never
breathed
her
suspicion
to
kurrell
because
she
was
not
certain
and
her
nature
led
her
to
be
very
certain
before
she
took
steps
in
any
direction
that
is
why
she
behaved
as
she
did
boulte
came
into
the
house
one
evening
and
leaned
against
the
of
the
chewing
his
moustache
boulte
was
putting
some
flowers
into
a
vase
there
is
a
pretence
of
civilisation
even
in
kashima
little
woman
said
boulte
quietly
do
you
care
for
me
immensely
said
she
with
a
laugh
can
you
ask
it
but
i
m
serious
said
boulte
do
you
care
for
me
boulte
dropped
the
flowers
and
turned
round
quickly
do
you
want
an
honest
answer
i
ve
asked
for
boulte
spoke
in
a
low
even
voice
for
five
minutes
very
distinctly
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
her
meaning
when
samson
broke
the
pillars
of
gaza
he
did
a
little
thing
and
one
not
to
be
compared
to
the
deliberate
pulling
down
of
a
woman
s
homestead
about
her
own
ears
there
was
no
wise
female
friend
to
advise
boulte
the
singularly
cautious
wife
to
hold
her
hand
she
struck
at
boulte
s
heart
because
her
own
was
sick
with
suspicion
of
kurrell
and
worn
out
with
the
long
strain
of
watching
alone
through
the
rains
there
was
no
plan
or
purpose
in
her
speaking
the
sentences
made
themselves
and
boulte
listened
leaning
against
the
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
when
all
was
over
and
boulte
began
to
breathe
through
her
nose
before
breaking
out
into
tears
he
laughed
and
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
at
the
dosehri
hills
is
that
all
he
said
thanks
i
only
wanted
to
know
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
said
the
woman
between
her
sobs
do
nothing
what
should
i
do
kill
kurrell
or
send
you
home
or
apply
for
leave
to
get
a
divorce
it
s
two
days
treck
into
he
laughed
again
and
went
on
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
you
can
ask
kurrell
to
dinner
tomorrow
no
on
thursday
that
will
allow
you
time
to
pack
and
you
can
bolt
with
him
i
give
you
my
word
i
won
t
he
took
up
his
helmet
and
went
out
of
the
room
and
boulte
sat
till
the
moonlight
streaked
the
floor
thinking
and
thinking
and
thinking
she
had
done
her
best
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
pull
the
house
down
but
it
would
not
fall
moreover
she
could
not
understand
her
husband
and
she
was
afraid
then
the
folly
of
her
useless
truthfulness
struck
her
and
she
was
ashamed
to
write
to
kurrell
saying
i
have
gone
mad
and
told
everything
my
husband
says
that
i
am
free
to
elope
with
you
get
a
dek
for
thursday
and
we
will
fly
after
there
was
a
about
that
procedure
which
did
not
appeal
to
her
so
she
sat
still
in
her
own
house
and
thought
at
boulte
came
back
from
his
walk
white
and
worn
and
haggard
and
the
woman
was
touched
at
his
distress
as
the
evening
wore
on
she
muttered
some
expression
of
sorrow
something
approaching
to
contrition
boulte
came
out
of
a
brown
study
and
said
oh
that
i
wasn
t
thinking
about
that
by
the
way
what
does
kurrell
say
to
the
elopement
i
haven
t
seen
him
said
boulte
good
god
is
that
all
but
boulte
was
not
listening
and
her
sentence
ended
in
a
gulp
the
next
day
brought
no
comfort
to
boulte
for
kurrell
did
not
appear
and
the
new
lift
that
she
in
the
five
minutes
madness
of
the
previous
evening
had
hoped
to
build
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
old
seemed
to
be
no
nearer
boulte
ate
his
breakfast
advised
her
to
see
her
arab
pony
fed
in
the
verandah
and
went
out
the
morning
wore
through
and
at
the
tension
became
unendurable
boulte
could
not
cry
she
had
finished
her
crying
in
the
night
and
now
she
did
not
want
to
be
left
alone
perhaps
the
vansuythen
woman
would
talk
to
her
and
since
talking
opens
the
heart
perhaps
there
might
be
some
comfort
to
be
found
in
her
company
she
was
the
only
other
woman
in
the
station
in
kashima
there
are
no
regular
every
one
can
drop
in
upon
every
one
else
at
pleasure
boulte
put
on
a
big
terai
hat
and
walked
across
to
the
vansuythens
house
to
borrow
last
week
s
queen
the
two
compounds
touched
and
instead
of
going
up
the
drive
she
crossed
through
the
gap
in
the
entering
the
house
from
the
back
as
she
passed
through
the
she
heard
behind
the
purdah
that
cloaked
the
door
her
husband
s
voice
saying
but
on
my
honour
on
my
soul
and
honour
i
tell
you
she
doesn
t
care
for
me
she
told
me
so
last
night
i
would
have
told
you
then
if
vansuythen
hadn
t
been
with
you
if
it
is
for
her
sake
that
you
ll
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
you
can
make
your
mind
easy
it
s
what
said
vansuythen
with
a
hysterical
little
laugh
kurrell
oh
it
can
t
be
you
two
must
have
made
some
horrible
mistake
perhaps
you
you
lost
your
temper
or
misunderstood
or
something
things
can
t
be
as
wrong
as
you
vansuythen
had
shifted
her
defence
to
avoid
the
man
s
pleading
and
was
desperately
trying
to
keep
him
to
a
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
insisted
and
it
can
be
all
put
right
boulte
laughed
grimly
it
can
t
be
captain
kurrell
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
taken
the
least
the
least
interest
in
your
wife
boulte
oh
do
listen
he
said
he
had
not
he
swore
he
had
not
said
vansuythen
the
purdah
rustled
and
the
speech
was
cut
short
by
the
entry
of
a
little
thin
woman
with
big
rings
round
her
eyes
vansuythen
stood
up
with
a
gasp
what
was
that
you
said
asked
boulte
never
mind
that
man
what
did
ted
say
to
you
what
did
he
say
to
you
what
did
he
say
to
you
vansuythen
sat
down
helplessly
on
the
sofa
overborne
by
the
trouble
of
her
questioner
he
said
i
can
t
remember
exactly
what
he
said
but
i
understood
him
to
say
that
is
but
really
boulte
isn
t
it
rather
a
strange
question
will
you
tell
me
what
he
said
repeated
boulte
even
a
tiger
will
fly
before
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
and
vansuythen
was
only
an
ordinarily
good
woman
she
began
in
a
sort
of
desperation
well
he
said
that
the
never
cared
for
you
at
all
and
of
course
there
was
not
the
least
reason
why
he
should
have
and
and
that
was
you
said
he
swore
he
had
not
cared
for
me
was
that
true
yes
said
vansuythen
very
softly
boulte
wavered
for
an
instant
where
she
stood
and
then
fell
forward
fainting
what
did
i
tell
you
said
boulte
as
though
the
conversation
had
been
unbroken
you
can
see
for
yourself
she
cares
for
the
light
began
to
break
into
his
dull
mind
and
he
went
on
and
what
was
he
saying
to
you
but
vansuythen
with
no
heart
for
explanations
or
impassioned
protestations
was
kneeling
over
boulte
oh
you
brute
she
cried
are
all
men
like
this
help
me
to
get
her
into
my
room
and
her
face
is
cut
against
the
table
oh
will
you
be
quiet
and
help
me
to
carry
her
i
hate
you
and
i
hate
captain
kurrell
lift
her
up
carefully
and
now
go
go
away
boulte
carried
his
wife
into
vansuythen
s
bedroom
and
departed
before
the
storm
of
that
lady
s
wrath
and
disgust
impenitent
and
burning
with
jealousy
kurrell
had
been
making
love
to
vansuythen
would
do
vansuythen
as
great
a
wrong
as
he
had
done
boulte
who
caught
himself
considering
whether
vansuythen
would
faint
if
she
discovered
that
the
man
she
loved
had
forsworn
her
in
the
middle
of
these
meditations
kurrell
came
cantering
along
the
road
and
pulled
up
with
a
cheery
been
mashing
vansuythen
as
usual
eh
bad
thing
for
a
sober
married
man
that
what
will
boulte
say
boulte
raised
his
head
and
said
slowly
oh
you
liar
kurrell
s
face
changed
what
s
that
he
asked
quickly
nothing
much
said
boulte
has
my
wife
told
you
that
you
two
are
free
to
go
off
whenever
you
please
she
has
been
good
enough
to
explain
the
situation
to
me
you
ve
been
a
true
friend
to
me
kurrell
old
man
haven
t
you
kurrell
groaned
and
tried
to
frame
some
sort
of
idiotic
sentence
about
being
willing
to
give
but
his
interest
in
the
woman
was
dead
had
died
out
in
the
rains
and
mentally
he
was
abusing
her
for
her
amazing
indiscretion
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
have
broken
off
the
thing
gently
and
by
degrees
and
now
he
was
saddled
with
boulte
s
voice
recalled
him
i
don
t
think
i
should
get
any
satisfaction
from
killing
you
and
i
m
pretty
sure
you
d
get
none
from
killing
then
in
a
querulous
tone
ludicrously
disproportioned
to
his
wrongs
boulte
added
seems
rather
a
pity
that
you
haven
t
the
decency
to
keep
to
the
woman
now
you
ve
got
her
you
ve
been
a
true
friend
to
her
too
haven
t
you
kurrell
stared
long
and
gravely
the
situation
was
getting
beyond
him
what
do
you
mean
he
said
boulte
answered
more
to
himself
than
the
questioner
my
wife
came
over
to
vansuythen
s
just
now
and
it
seems
you
d
been
telling
vansuythen
that
you
d
never
cared
for
emma
i
suppose
you
lied
as
usual
what
had
vansuythen
to
do
with
you
or
you
with
her
try
to
speak
the
truth
for
once
in
a
kurrell
took
the
double
insult
without
wincing
and
replied
by
another
question
go
on
what
happened
emma
fainted
said
boulte
simply
but
look
here
what
had
you
been
saying
to
vansuythen
kurrell
laughed
boulte
had
with
unbridled
tongue
made
havoc
of
his
plans
and
he
could
at
least
retaliate
by
hurting
the
man
in
whose
eyes
he
was
humiliated
and
shown
dishonourable
said
to
her
what
does
a
man
tell
a
lie
like
that
for
i
suppose
i
said
pretty
much
what
you
ve
said
unless
i
m
a
good
deal
i
spoke
the
truth
said
boulte
again
more
to
himself
than
kurrell
emma
told
me
she
hated
me
she
has
no
right
in
no
i
suppose
not
you
re
only
her
husband
y
know
and
what
did
vansuythen
say
after
you
had
laid
your
disengaged
heart
at
her
feet
kurrell
felt
almost
virtuous
as
he
put
the
question
i
don
t
think
that
matters
boulte
replied
and
it
doesn
t
concern
but
it
does
i
tell
you
it
does
began
kurrell
shamelessly
the
sentence
was
cut
by
a
roar
of
laughter
from
boulte
s
lips
kurrell
was
silent
for
an
instant
and
then
he
too
laughed
laughed
long
and
loudly
rocking
in
his
saddle
it
was
an
unpleasant
sound
the
mirthless
mirth
of
these
men
on
the
long
white
line
of
the
narkarra
road
there
were
no
strangers
in
kashima
or
they
might
have
thought
that
captivity
within
the
dosehri
hills
had
driven
half
the
european
population
mad
the
laughter
ended
abruptly
and
kurrell
was
the
first
to
speak
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
boulte
looked
up
the
road
and
at
the
hills
nothing
said
he
quietly
what
s
the
use
it
s
too
ghastly
for
anything
we
must
let
the
old
life
go
on
i
can
only
call
you
a
hound
and
a
liar
and
i
can
t
go
on
calling
you
names
for
ever
besides
which
i
don
t
feel
that
i
m
much
better
we
can
t
get
out
of
this
place
what
is
there
to
do
kurrell
looked
round
the
of
kashima
and
made
no
reply
the
injured
husband
took
up
the
wondrous
tale
ride
on
and
speak
to
emma
if
you
want
to
god
knows
i
don
t
care
what
you
he
walked
forward
and
left
kurrell
gazing
blankly
after
him
kurrell
did
not
ride
on
either
to
see
boulte
or
vansuythen
he
sat
in
his
saddle
and
thought
while
his
pony
grazed
by
the
roadside
the
whir
of
approaching
wheels
roused
him
vansuythen
was
driving
home
boulte
white
and
wan
with
a
cut
on
her
forehead
stop
please
said
boulte
i
want
to
speak
to
vansuythen
obeyed
but
as
boulte
leaned
forward
putting
her
hand
upon
the
splashboard
of
the
kurrell
spoke
i
ve
seen
your
husband
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
further
explanation
the
man
s
eyes
were
fixed
not
upon
boulte
but
her
companion
boulte
saw
the
look
speak
to
him
she
pleaded
turning
to
the
woman
at
her
side
oh
speak
to
him
tell
him
what
you
told
me
just
now
tell
him
you
hate
him
tell
him
you
hate
him
she
bent
forward
and
wept
bitterly
while
the
sais
impassive
went
forward
to
hold
the
horse
vansuythen
turned
scarlet
and
dropped
the
reins
she
wished
to
be
no
party
to
such
unholy
explanations
i
ve
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
began
coldly
but
boulte
s
sobs
overcame
her
and
she
addressed
herself
to
the
man
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
to
say
captain
kurrell
i
don
t
know
what
i
can
call
you
i
think
you
ve
you
ve
behaved
abominably
and
she
has
cut
her
forehead
terribly
against
the
it
doesn
t
hurt
it
isn
t
anything
said
boulte
feebly
that
doesn
t
matter
tell
him
what
you
told
me
say
you
don
t
care
for
him
oh
ted
won
t
you
believe
her
mrs
boulte
has
made
me
understand
that
you
were
that
you
were
fond
of
her
once
upon
a
time
went
on
vansuythen
well
said
kurrell
brutally
it
seems
to
me
that
boulte
had
better
be
fond
of
her
own
husband
stop
said
vansuythen
hear
me
first
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
want
to
know
anything
about
you
and
boulte
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
hate
you
that
i
think
you
are
a
cur
and
that
i
ll
never
never
speak
to
you
again
oh
i
don
t
dare
to
say
what
i
think
of
you
you
man
i
want
to
speak
to
ted
moaned
boulte
but
the
rattled
on
and
kurrell
was
left
on
the
road
shamed
and
boiling
with
wrath
against
boulte
he
waited
till
vansuythen
was
driving
back
to
her
own
house
and
she
being
freed
from
the
embarrassment
of
boulte
s
presence
learned
for
the
second
time
her
opinion
of
himself
and
his
actions
in
the
evenings
it
was
the
wont
of
all
kashima
to
meet
at
the
platform
on
the
narkarra
road
to
drink
tea
and
discuss
the
trivialities
of
the
day
major
vansuythen
and
his
wife
found
themselves
alone
at
the
for
almost
the
first
time
in
their
remembrance
and
the
cheery
major
in
the
teeth
of
his
wife
s
remarkably
reasonable
suggestion
that
the
rest
of
the
station
might
be
sick
insisted
upon
driving
round
to
the
two
bungalows
and
unearthing
the
population
sitting
in
the
twilight
said
he
with
great
indignation
to
the
boultes
that
ll
never
do
hang
it
all
we
re
one
family
here
you
must
come
out
and
so
must
kurrell
i
ll
make
him
bring
his
so
great
is
the
power
of
honest
simplicity
and
a
good
digestion
over
guilty
consciences
that
all
kashima
did
turn
out
even
down
to
the
banjo
and
the
major
embraced
the
company
in
one
expansive
grin
as
he
grinned
vansuythen
raised
her
eyes
for
an
instant
and
looked
at
all
kashima
her
meaning
was
clear
major
vansuythen
would
never
know
anything
he
was
to
be
the
outsider
in
that
happy
family
whose
cage
was
the
dosehri
hills
you
re
singing
villainously
out
of
tune
kurrell
said
the
major
truthfully
pass
me
that
and
he
sang
in
till
the
stars
came
out
and
all
kashima
went
to
dinner
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
new
life
of
kashima
the
life
that
boulte
made
when
her
tongue
was
loosened
in
the
twilight
vansuythen
has
never
told
the
major
and
since
he
insists
upon
keeping
up
a
burdensome
geniality
she
has
been
compelled
to
break
her
vow
of
not
speaking
to
kurrell
this
speech
which
must
of
necessity
preserve
the
semblance
of
politeness
and
interest
serves
admirably
to
keep
alight
the
flame
of
jealousy
and
dull
hatred
in
boulte
s
bosom
as
it
awakens
the
same
passions
in
his
wife
s
heart
boulte
hates
vansuythen
because
she
has
taken
ted
from
her
and
in
some
curious
fashion
hates
her
because
vansuythen
and
here
the
wife
s
eyes
see
far
more
clearly
than
the
husband
s
detests
ted
and
ted
that
gallant
captain
and
honourable
man
knows
now
that
it
is
possible
to
hate
a
woman
once
loved
to
the
verge
of
wishing
to
silence
her
for
ever
with
blows
above
all
is
he
shocked
that
boulte
can
not
see
the
error
of
her
ways
boulte
and
he
go
out
together
in
all
friendship
boulte
has
put
their
relationship
on
a
most
satisfactory
footing
you
re
a
blackguard
he
says
to
kurrell
and
i
ve
lost
any
i
may
ever
have
had
but
when
you
re
with
me
i
can
feel
certain
that
you
are
not
with
vansuythen
or
making
emma
kurrell
endures
anything
that
boulte
may
say
to
him
sometimes
they
are
away
for
three
days
together
and
then
the
major
insists
upon
his
wife
going
over
to
sit
with
boulte
although
vansuythen
has
repeatedly
declared
that
she
prefers
her
husband
s
company
to
any
in
the
world
from
the
way
in
which
she
clings
to
him
she
would
certainly
seem
to
be
speaking
the
truth
but
of
course
as
the
major
says
in
a
little
station
we
must
all
be
the
hill
of
illusion
what
rendered
vain
their
deep
desire
a
god
a
god
their
severance
ruled
and
bade
between
their
shores
to
be
the
unplumbed
salt
estranging
sea
matthew
arnold
he
tell
your
jhampanies
not
to
hurry
so
dear

round

didn
t

to
you

shaping
my
affairs

to
you

the
first
time

to
know
that
i

a
miracle
of
constancy

early
morning

down
straight
by
night

the
for
rome
that

my
idea
the
continent
and
sweden
a
honeymoon
she
ssh
don
t
talk
of
it
in
that
way
it
makes
me
afraid
guy
how
long
have
we
two
been
insane
he
seven
months
and
fourteen
days
i
forget
the
odd
hours
exactly
but
i
ll
think
she
i
only
wanted
to
see
if
you
remembered
who
are
those
two
on
the
blessington
road
he
eabrey
and
the
penner
woman
what
do
they
matter
to
us
tell
me
everything
that
you
ve
been
doing
and
saying
and
thinking
she
doing
little
saying
less
and
thinking
a
great
deal
i
ve
hardly
been
out
at
all
he
that
was
wrong
of
you
you
haven
t
been
moping
she
not
very
much
can
you
wonder
that
i
m
disinclined
for
amusement
he
frankly
i
do
where
was
the
difficulty
she
in
this
only
the
more
people
i
know
and
the
more
i
m
known
here
the
wider
spread
will
be
the
news
of
the
crash
when
it
comes
i
don
t
like
that
he
nonsense
we
shall
be
out
of
it
she
you
think
so
he
i
m
sure
of
it
if
there
is
any
power
in
steam
or
to
carry
us
away
ha
ha
she
and
the
fun
of
the
situation
comes
in
where
my
lancelot
he
nowhere
guinevere
i
was
only
thinking
of
something
she
they
say
men
have
a
keener
sense
of
humour
than
women
now
i
was
thinking
of
the
scandal
he
don
t
think
of
anything
so
ugly
we
shall
be
beyond
it
she
it
will
be
there
all
the
same
in
the
mouths
of
simla
telegraphed
over
india
and
talked
of
at
the
dinners
and
when
he
goes
out
they
will
stare
at
him
to
see
how
he
takes
it
and
we
shall
be
dead
guy
dear
dead
and
cast
into
the
outer
darkness
where
there
is
he
love
at
least
isn
t
that
enough
she
i
have
said
so
he
and
you
think
so
still
she
what
do
you
think
he
what
have
i
done
it
means
equal
ruin
to
me
as
the
world
reckons
it
outcasting
the
loss
of
my
appointment
the
breaking
off
my
life
s
work
i
pay
my
price
she
and
are
you
so
much
above
the
world
that
you
can
afford
to
pay
it
am
i
he
my
divinity
what
else
she
a
very
ordinary
woman
i
m
afraid
but
so
far
respectable
how
d
you
do
your
husband
i
think
he
s
riding
down
to
annandale
with
colonel
statters
yes
isn
t
it
divine
after
the
rain
guy
how
long
am
i
to
be
allowed
to
bow
to
middleditch
till
the
he
frowsy
scotchwoman
what
is
the
use
of
bringing
her
into
the
discussion
you
were
saying
she
nothing
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
hanged
he
yes
once
she
what
was
it
for
he
murder
of
course
she

so
great
a
sin
after
all
i
wonder
how
he
felt
before

drop
fell

i
don
t
think

much
what
a
gruesome
little
woman
it

this
evening

on
your
cape
dear
she
i
think

have
sunshine

the
ladies
mile

ulster

opinion
of
a
woman

dress
when
he
is
desperately
and
abjectly
in
love
with
the
wearer

amirtollah
kutcha
road
i
don
t
believe
that

crumble
till
the
day
of
judgment

ways

captain
congleton
coming

be
willing
to
escort
me
he
goose
between
us
too
damn
captain
congleton
she
chivalrous
knight
is
it
your
habit
to
swear
much
in
talking
it
jars
a
little
and
you
might
swear
at
me
he
my
angel
i
didn
t
know
what
i
was
saying
and
you
changed
so
quickly
that
i
couldn
t
follow
i
ll
apologise
in
dust
and
ashes
she
there
ll
be
enough
of
those
later
on
captain
congleton
going
to
the
already
what
dances

i
giving
you
next
week

you
must
have
written
them
down
wrong
five
and
seven
i
said
if
you
ve
made
a
mistake
i
certainly
don
t
intend
to
suffer
for
it
you
must
alter
your
programme
he
i
thought
you
told
me
that
you
had
not
been
going
out
much
this
season
she
quite
true
but
when
i
do
i
dance
with
captain
congleton
he
dances
very
nicely
he
and
sit
out
with
him
i
suppose
she
yes
have
you
any
objection
shall
i
stand
under
the
chandelier
in
future
he
what
does
he
talk
to
you
about
she
what
do
men
talk
about
when
they
sit
out
he
ugh
don
t
well
now
i
m
up
you
must
dispense
with
the
fascinating
congleton
for
a
while
i
don
t
like
him
she
after
a
pause
do
you
know
what
you
have
said
he
can
t
say
that
i
do
exactly
i
m
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
she
so
i
see
and
feel
my
true
and
faithful
lover
where
is
your
eternal
constancy
unalterable
trust
and
reverent
devotion
i
remember
those
phrases
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
them
i
mention
a
man
s
name
he
a
good
deal
more
than
that
she
well
speak
to
him
about
a
dance
perhaps
the
last
dance
that
i
shall
ever
dance
in
my
life
before
i
before
i
go
away
and
you
at
once
distrust
and
insult
me
he
i
never
said
a
word
she
how
much
did
you
imply
guy
is
this
amount
of
confidence
to
be
our
stock
to
start
the
new
life
on
he
no
of
course
not
i
didn
t
mean
that
on
my
word
and
honour
i
didn
t
let
it
pass
dear
please
let
it
pass
she
this
once
yes
and
a
second
time
and
again
and
again
all
through
the
years
when
i
shall
be
unable
to
resent
it
you
want
too
much
my
lancelot
and
you
know
too
much
he
how
do
you
mean
she
that
is
a
part
of
the
punishment
there
can
not
be
perfect
trust
between
us
he
in
heaven
s
name
why
not
she
hush
the
other
place
is
quite
enough
ask
yourself
he
i
don
t
follow
she
you
trust
me
so
implicitly
that
when
i
look
at
another
man
never
mind
guy
have
you
ever
made
love
to
a
girl
a
good
girl
he
something
of
the
sort
centuries
ago
in
the
dark
ages
before
i
ever
met
you
dear
she
tell
me
what
you
said
to
her
he
what
does
a
man
say
to
a
girl
i
ve
forgotten
she
i
remember
he
tells
her
that
he
trusts
her
and
worships
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
that
he
ll
love
and
honour
and
protect
her
till
her
dying
day
and
so
she
marries
in
that
belief
at
least
i
speak
of
one
girl
who
was
not
protected
he
well
and
then
she
and
then
guy
and
then
that
girl
needs
ten
times
the
love
and
trust
and
honour
yes
honour
that
was
enough
when
she
was
only
a
mere
wife
if
if
the
other
life
she
chooses
to
lead
is
to
be
made
even
bearable
do
you
understand
he
even
bearable
it
ll
be
paradise
she
ah
can
you
give
me
all
i
ve
asked
for
not
now

a
few
months

think
of
what
you
might
have
done
if
you
had
kept
your
own
appointment
and
your
caste

when
you

a
drag

a
burden

be
no

three
seconds
later

to
discover
whether

another
man
at
the
back
of
all
this

woman

if

caught
but
the
import
show
it
us
hugues
of
master
hugues
of
dressed
don
t
tell
me
that
woman
ever
dressed
in
her
life
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
her
ayah
no
her
husband
it
must
have
been
a
man
threw
her
clothes
at
her
she
then
did
her
hair
with
her
fingers
and
rubbed
her
bonnet
in
the
flue
under
the
bed
i
know
she
did
as
well
as
if
i
had
assisted
at
the
orgy
who
is
she
said
hauksbee
don
t
said
mallowe
feebly
you
make
my
head
ache
i
am
miserable
stay
me
with
fondants
comfort
me
with
chocolates
for
i
am
did
you
bring
anything
from
peliti
s
questions
to
begin
with
you
shall
have
the
sweets
when
you
have
answered
them
who
and
what
is
the
creature
there
were
at
least
men
round
her
and
she
appeared
to
be
going
to
sleep
in
their
delville
said
mallowe
shady
delville
to
distinguish
her
from
jim
of
that
ilk
she
dances
as
untidily
as
she
dresses
i
believe
and
her
husband
is
somewhere
in
madras
go
and
call
if
you
are
so
what
have
i
to
do
with
shigramitish
women
she
merely
caught
my
attention
for
a
minute
and
i
wondered
at
the
attraction
that
a
dowd
has
for
a
certain
type
of
man
i
expected
to
see
her
walk
out
of
her
clothes
until
i
looked
at
her
hooks
and
eyes
surely
drawled
mallowe
don
t
be
clever
polly
you
make
my
head
ache
and
round
this
hayrick
stood
a
crowd
of
men
a
positive
crowd
perhaps
they
also
polly
don
t
be
rabelaisian
mallowe
curled
herself
up
comfortably
on
the
sofa
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
sweets
she
and
hauksbee
shared
the
same
house
at
simla
and
these
things
befell
two
seasons
after
the
matter
of
otis
yeere
which
has
been
already
recorded
hauksbee
stepped
into
the
verandah
and
looked
down
upon
the
mall
her
forehead
puckered
with
thought
hah
said
hauksbee
shortly
indeed
what
is
it
said
mallowe
sleepily
that
dowd
and
the
dancing
master
to
whom
i
why
to
the
dancing
master
he
is
a
gentleman
of
reprobate
and
romantic
tendencies
and
tries
to
be
a
friend
of
then
make
up
your
mind
to
lose
him
dowds
cling
by
nature
and
i
should
imagine
that
this
animal
how
terrible
her
bonnet
looks
from
above
is
specially
she
is
welcome
to
the
dancing
master
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
never
could
take
an
interest
in
a
monotonous
liar
the
frustrated
aim
of
his
life
is
to
persuade
people
that
he
is
a
i
think
i
ve
met
that
sort
of
man
before
and
isn
t
he
no
he
confided
that
to
me
a
few
days
ago
ugh
some
men
ought
to
be
what
happened
then
he
posed
as
the
horror
of
horrors
a
misunderstood
man
heaven
knows
the
femme
incomprise
is
sad
enough
and
bad
enough
but
the
other
thing
and
so
fat
too
i
should
have
laughed
in
his
face
men
seldom
confide
in
me
how
is
it
they
come
to
you
for
the
sake
of
impressing
me
with
their
careers
in
the
past
protect
me
from
men
with
confidences
and
yet
you
encourage
them
what
can
i
do
they
talk
i
listen
and
they
vow
that
i
am
sympathetic
i
know
i
always
profess
astonishment
even
when
the
plot
is
of
the
most
old
yes
men
are
so
unblushingly
explicit
if
they
are
once
allowed
to
talk
whereas
women
s
confidences
are
full
of
reservations
and
fibs
except
when
they
go
mad
and
babble
of
the
after
a
week
s
acquaintance
really
if
you
come
to
consider
we
know
a
great
deal
more
of
men
than
of
our
own
and
the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
men
will
never
believe
it
they
say
we
are
trying
to
hide
they
are
generally
doing
that
on
their
own
account
alas
these
chocolates
pall
upon
me
and
i
haven
t
eaten
more
than
a
dozen
i
think
i
shall
go
to
then
you
ll
get
fat
dear
if
you
took
more
exercise
and
a
more
intelligent
interest
in
your
neighbours
you
would
be
as
much
loved
as
hauksbee
you
re
a
darling
in
many
ways
and
i
like
you
you
are
not
a
woman
s
woman
but
why
do
you
trouble
yourself
about
mere
human
beings
because
in
the
absence
of
angels
who
i
am
sure
would
be
horribly
dull
men
and
women
are
the
most
fascinating
things
in
the
whole
wide
world
lazy
one
i
am
interested
in
the
dowd
i
am
interested
in
the
dancing
master
i
am
interested
in
the
hawley
boy
and
i
am
interested
in
why
couple
me
with
the
hawley
boy
he
is
your
yes
and
in
his
own
guileless
speech
i
m
making
a
good
thing
out
of
him
when
he
is
slightly
more
reformed
and
has
passed
his
higher
standard
or
whatever
the
authorities
think
fit
to
exact
from
him
i
shall
select
a
pretty
little
girl
the
holt
girl
i
think
and
here
she
waved
her
hands
airily
whom
hauksbee
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
that
s
and
when
you
have
yoked
may
holt
with
the
most
notorious
detrimental
in
simla
and
earned
the
undying
hatred
of
mamma
holt
what
will
you
do
with
me
dispenser
of
the
destinies
of
the
universe
hauksbee
dropped
into
a
low
chair
in
front
of
the
fire
and
chin
in
hand
gazed
long
and
steadfastly
at
mallowe
i
do
not
know
she
said
shaking
her
head
what
i
shall
do
with
you
dear
it
s
obviously
impossible
to
marry
you
to
some
one
else
your
husband
would
object
and
the
experiment
might
not
be
successful
after
all
i
think
i
shall
begin
by
preventing
you
from
what
is
it
sleeping
on
benches
and
snoring
in
the
don
t
i
don
t
like
your
quotations
they
are
so
rude
go
to
the
library
and
bring
me
new
while
you
sleep
no
if
you
don
t
come
with
me
i
shall
spread
your
newest
frock
on
my
and
when
any
one
asks
me
what
i
am
doing
i
shall
say
that
i
am
going
to
phelps
s
to
get
it
let
out
i
shall
take
care
that
macnamara
sees
me
put
your
things
on
there
s
a
good
mallowe
groaned
and
obeyed
and
the
two
went
off
to
the
library
where
they
found
delville
and
the
man
who
went
by
the
of
the
dancing
master
by
that
time
mallowe
was
awake
and
eloquent
that
is
the
creature
said
hauksbee
with
the
air
of
one
pointing
out
a
slug
in
the
road
no
said
mallowe
the
man
is
the
creature
ugh
mr
bent
i
thought
you
were
coming
to
tea
this
surely
it
was
for
was
it
not
answered
the
dancing
master
i
understood
i
fancied
i
m
so
sorry
how
very
unfortunate
but
mallowe
had
passed
on
for
the
practised
equivocator
you
said
he
was
murmured
hauksbee
he
strikes
me
as
a
failure
now
wherefore
should
he
have
preferred
a
walk
with
the
dowd
to
tea
with
us
elective
affinities
i
suppose
both
grubby
polly
i
d
never
forgive
that
woman
as
long
as
the
world
i
forgive
every
woman
everything
said
mallowe
he
will
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
her
what
a
common
voice
she
has
delville
s
voice
was
not
pretty
her
carriage
was
even
less
lovely
and
her
raiment
was
strikingly
neglected
all
these
things
mallowe
noticed
over
the
top
of
a
magazine
now
what
is
there
in
her
said
hauksbee
do
you
see
what
i
meant
about
the
clothes
falling
off
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
perish
sooner
than
be
seen
with
that
and
yet
she
has
good
eyes
but
oh
what
is
it
she
doesn
t
know
how
to
use
them
on
my
honour
she
does
not
look
oh
look
untidiness
i
can
endure
but
ignorance
never
the
woman
s
a
hsh
she
ll
hear
all
the
women
in
simla
are
fools
she
ll
think
i
mean
some
one
else
now
she
s
going
out
what
a
thoroughly
objectionable
couple
she
and
the
dancing
master
make
which
reminds
me
do
you
suppose
they
ll
ever
dance
together
wait
and
see
i
don
t
envy
her
the
conversation
of
the
dancing
master
loathly
man
his
wife
ought
to
be
up
here
before
long
do
you
know
anything
about
him
only
what
he
told
me
it
may
be
all
a
fiction
he
married
a
girl
bred
in
the
country
i
think
and
being
an
honourable
chivalrous
soul
told
me
that
he
repented
his
bargain
and
sent
her
to
her
as
often
as
possible
a
person
who
has
lived
in
the
doon
since
the
memory
of
man
and
goes
to
mussoorie
when
other
people
go
home
the
wife
is
with
her
at
present
so
he
babies
one
only
but
he
talks
of
his
wife
in
a
revolting
way
i
hated
him
for
it
he
thought
he
was
being
epigrammatic
and
that
is
a
vice
peculiar
to
men
i
dislike
him
because
he
is
generally
in
the
wake
of
some
girl
disappointing
the
eligibles
he
will
persecute
may
holt
no
more
unless
i
am
much
no
i
think
delville
may
occupy
his
attention
for
a
do
you
suppose
she
knows
that
he
is
the
head
of
a
family
not
from
his
lips
he
swore
me
to
eternal
secrecy
wherefore
i
tell
you
don
t
you
know
that
type
of
man
not
intimately
thank
goodness
as
a
general
rule
when
a
man
begins
to
abuse
his
wife
to
me
i
find
that
the
lord
gives
me
wherewith
to
answer
him
according
to
his
folly
and
we
part
with
a
coolness
between
us
i
i
m
different
i
ve
no
sense
of
cultivate
it
then
it
has
been
my
mainstay
for
more
years
than
i
care
to
think
about
a
sense
of
humour
will
save
a
woman
when
religion
training
and
home
influences
fail
and
we
may
all
need
salvation
do
you
suppose
that
the
delville
woman
has
humour
her
dress
betrays
her
how
can
a
thing
who
wears
her
supplement
under
her
left
arm
have
any
notion
of
the
fitness
of
things
much
less
their
folly
if
she
discards
the
dancing
master
after
having
once
seen
him
dance
i
may
respect
her
otherwise
but
are
we
not
both
assuming
a
great
deal
too
much
dear
you
saw
the
woman
at
peliti
s
half
an
hour
later
you
saw
her
walking
with
the
dancing
master
an
hour
later
you
met
her
here
at
the
still
with
the
dancing
master
still
with
the
dancing
master
i
admit
but
why
on
the
strength
of
that
should
you
imagine
i
imagine
nothing
i
have
no
imagination
i
am
only
convinced
that
the
dancing
master
is
attracted
to
the
dowd
because
he
is
objectionable
in
every
way
and
she
in
every
other
if
i
know
the
man
as
you
have
described
him
he
holds
his
wife
in
slavery
at
she
is
twenty
years
younger
than
poor
wretch
and
in
the
end
after
he
has
posed
and
swaggered
and
lied
he
has
a
mouth
under
that
ragged
moustache
simply
made
for
lies
he
will
be
rewarded
according
to
his
i
wonder
what
those
really
are
said
mallowe
but
hauksbee
her
face
close
to
the
shelf
of
the
new
books
was
humming
softly
what
shall
he
have
who
killed
the
deer
she
was
a
lady
of
unfettered
speech
one
month
later
she
announced
her
intention
of
calling
upon
delville
both
hauksbee
and
mallowe
were
in
morning
wrappers
and
there
was
a
great
peace
in
the
land
i
should
go
as
i
was
said
mallowe
it
would
be
a
delicate
compliment
to
her
hauksbee
studied
herself
in
the
glass
assuming
for
a
moment
that
she
ever
darkened
these
doors
i
should
put
on
this
robe
after
all
the
others
to
show
her
what
a
ought
to
be
it
might
enliven
her
as
it
is
i
shall
go
in
the
sweet
emblem
of
youth
and
innocence
and
shall
put
on
my
new
if
you
really
are
going
dirty
tan
would
be
too
good
and
you
know
that
spots
with
the
i
care
not
i
may
make
her
envious
at
least
i
shall
try
though
one
can
not
expect
very
much
from
a
woman
who
puts
a
lace
tucker
into
her
just
heavens
when
did
she
do
that
yesterday
riding
with
the
dancing
master
i
met
them
at
the
back
of
jakko
and
the
rain
had
made
the
lace
lie
down
to
complete
the
effect
she
was
wearing
an
unclean
terai
with
the
elastic
under
her
chin
i
felt
almost
too
well
content
to
take
the
trouble
to
despise
the
hawley
boy
was
riding
with
you
what
did
he
think
does
a
boy
ever
notice
these
things
should
i
like
him
if
he
did
he
stared
in
the
rudest
way
and
just
when
i
thought
he
had
seen
the
elastic
he
said
there
s
something
very
taking
about
that
i
rebuked
him
on
the
spot
i
don
t
approve
of
boys
being
taken
by
other
than
your
own
i
shouldn
t
be
in
the
least
surprised
if
the
hawley
boy
immediately
went
to
i
forbade
him
let
her
be
satisfied
with
the
dancing
master
and
his
wife
when
she
comes
up
i
m
rather
curious
to
see
mrs
bent
and
the
delville
woman
hauksbee
departed
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
returned
slightly
flushed
there
is
no
limit
to
the
treachery
of
youth
i
ordered
the
hawley
boy
as
he
valued
my
patronage
not
to
call
the
first
person
i
stumble
over
literally
stumble
over
in
her
poky
dark
little
is
of
course
the
hawley
boy
she
kept
us
waiting
ten
minutes
and
then
emerged
as
though
she
had
been
tipped
out
of
the
you
know
my
way
dear
when
i
am
at
all
put
out
i
was
superior
crrrrushingly
superior
lifted
my
eyes
to
heaven
and
had
heard
of
nothing
dropped
my
eyes
on
the
carpet
and
really
didn
t
know
played
with
my
cardcase
and
supposed
the
hawley
boy
giggled
like
a
girl
and
i
had
to
freeze
him
with
scowls
between
the
and
she
she
sat
in
a
heap
on
the
edge
of
a
couch
and
managed
to
convey
the
impression
that
she
was
suffering
from
at
the
very
least
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
ask
after
her
symptoms
when
i
rose
she
grunted
just
like
a
buffalo
in
the
water
too
lazy
to
are
you
certain
am
i
blind
polly
laziness
sheer
laziness
nothing
else
or
her
garments
were
only
constructed
for
sitting
down
in
i
stayed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
trying
to
penetrate
the
gloom
to
guess
what
her
surroundings
were
like
while
she
stuck
out
her
lu
cy
well
i
ll
withdraw
the
tongue
though
i
m
sure
if
she
didn
t
do
it
when
i
was
in
the
room
she
did
the
minute
i
was
outside
at
any
rate
she
lay
in
a
lump
and
grunted
ask
the
hawley
boy
dear
i
believe
the
grunts
were
meant
for
sentences
but
she
spoke
so
indistinctly
that
i
can
t
swear
to
you
are
incorrigible
i
am
not
treat
me
civilly
give
me
peace
with
honour
don
t
put
the
only
available
seat
facing
the
window
and
a
child
may
eat
jam
in
my
lap
before
church
but
i
resent
being
grunted
at
wouldn
t
you
do
you
suppose
that
she
communicates
her
views
on
life
and
love
to
the
dancing
master
in
a
set
of
modulated
grmphs
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
the
dancing
he
came
as
we
went
and
the
dowd
grew
almost
cordial
at
the
sight
of
him
he
smiled
greasily
and
moved
about
that
darkened
in
a
suspiciously
familiar
don
t
be
uncharitable
any
sin
but
that
i
ll
listen
to
the
voice
of
history
i
am
only
describing
what
i
saw
he
entered
the
heap
on
the
sofa
revived
slightly
and
the
hawley
boy
and
i
came
away
together
he
is
disillusioned
but
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
lecture
him
severely
for
going
there
and
that
s
now
for
pity
s
sake
leave
the
wretched
creature
and
the
dancing
master
alone
they
never
did
you
any
no
harm
to
dress
as
an
example
and
a
for
half
simla
and
then
to
find
this
person
who
is
dressed
by
the
hand
of
god
not
that
i
wish
to
disparage
him
for
a
moment
but
you
know
the
tikka
dhurzie
way
he
attires
those
lilies
of
the
field
this
person
draws
the
eyes
of
men
and
some
of
them
nice
men
it
s
almost
enough
to
make
one
discard
clothing
i
told
the
hawley
boy
and
what
did
that
sweet
youth
do
turned
and
looked
across
the
far
blue
hills
like
a
distressed
cherub
am
i
talking
wildly
polly
let
me
say
my
say
and
i
shall
be
calm
otherwise
i
may
go
abroad
and
disturb
simla
with
a
few
original
reflections
excepting
always
your
own
sweet
self
there
isn
t
a
single
woman
in
the
land
who
understands
me
when
i
am
what
s
the
word
suggested
mallowe
exactly
and
now
let
us
have
tiffin
the
demands
of
society
are
exhausting
and
as
delville
says
here
hauksbee
to
the
horror
of
the
khitmatgars
lapsed
into
a
series
of
grunts
while
mallowe
stared
in
lazy
surprise
god
gie
us
a
guid
conceit
of
oorselves
said
hauksbee
piously
returning
to
her
natural
speech
now
in
any
other
woman
that
would
have
been
vulgar
i
am
consumed
with
curiosity
to
see
mrs
bent
i
expect
woman
of
one
idea
said
mallowe
shortly
all
complications
are
as
old
as
the
hills
i
have
lived
through
or
near
all
all
all
and
yet
do
not
understand
that
men
and
women
never
behave
twice
alike
i
am
old
who
was
young
if
ever
i
put
my
head
in
your
lap
you
dear
big
sceptic
you
will
learn
that
my
parting
is
gauze
but
never
no
never
have
i
lost
my
interest
in
men
and
women
polly
i
shall
see
this
business
out
to
the
bitter
i
am
going
to
sleep
said
mallowe
calmly
i
never
interfere
with
men
or
women
unless
i
am
compelled
and
she
retired
with
dignity
to
her
own
room
hauksbee
s
curiosity
was
not
long
left
ungratified
for
mrs
bent
came
up
to
simla
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
faithfully
reported
above
and
pervaded
the
mall
by
her
husband
s
side
behold
said
hauksbee
thoughtfully
rubbing
her
nose
that
is
the
last
link
of
the
chain
if
we
omit
the
husband
of
the
delville
whoever
he
may
be
let
me
consider
the
bents
and
the
delvilles
inhabit
the
same
hotel
and
the
delville
is
detested
by
the
waddy
do
you
know
the
waddy
who
is
almost
as
big
a
dowd
the
waddy
also
abominates
the
male
bent
for
which
if
her
other
sins
do
not
weigh
too
heavily
she
will
eventually
go
to
don
t
be
irreverent
said
mallowe
i
like
bent
s
i
am
discussing
the
waddy
returned
hauksbee
loftily
the
waddy
will
take
the
female
bent
apart
after
having
borrowed
yes
everything
that
she
can
from
hairpins
to
babies
bottles
such
my
dear
is
life
in
a
hotel
the
waddy
will
tell
the
female
bent
facts
and
fictions
about
the
dancing
master
and
the
lucy
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
were
not
always
looking
into
people
s
anybody
can
look
into
their
front
drawingrooms
and
remember
whatever
i
do
and
whatever
i
look
i
never
talk
as
the
waddy
will
let
us
hope
that
the
dancing
master
s
greasy
smile
and
manner
of
the
pedagogue
will
soften
the
heart
of
that
cow
his
wife
if
mouths
speak
truth
i
should
think
that
little
mrs
bent
could
get
very
angry
on
but
what
reason
has
she
for
being
angry
what
reason
the
dancing
master
in
himself
is
a
reason
how
does
it
go
if
in
his
life
some
trivial
errors
fall
look
in
his
face
and
you
ll
believe
them
i
am
prepared
to
credit
any
evil
of
the
dancing
master
because
i
hate
him
so
and
the
dowd
is
so
disgustingly
badly
that
she
too
is
capable
of
every
iniquity
i
always
prefer
to
believe
the
best
of
everybody
it
saves
so
much
very
good
i
prefer
to
believe
the
worst
it
saves
useless
expenditure
of
sympathy
and
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
the
waddy
believes
with
mallowe
sighed
and
made
no
answer
the
conversation
was
holden
after
dinner
while
hauksbee
was
dressing
for
a
dance
i
am
too
tired
to
go
pleaded
mallowe
and
hauksbee
left
her
in
peace
till
two
in
the
morning
when
she
was
aware
of
emphatic
knocking
at
her
door
don
t
be
very
angry
dear
said
hauksbee
my
idiot
of
an
ayah
has
gone
home
and
as
i
hope
to
sleep
there
isn
t
a
soul
in
the
place
to
unlace
oh
this
is
too
bad
said
mallowe
sulkily
cant
help
it
i
m
a
lone
lorn
dear
but
i
will
not
sleep
in
my
stays
and
such
news
too
oh
do
unlace
me
there
s
a
darling
the
dowd
the
dancing
master
i
and
the
hawley
boy
you
know
the
north
verandah
how
can
i
do
anything
if
you
spin
round
like
this
protested
mallowe
fumbling
with
the
knot
of
the
laces
oh
i
forget
i
must
tell
my
tale
without
the
aid
of
your
eyes
do
you
know
you
ve
lovely
eyes
dear
well
to
begin
with
i
took
the
hawley
boy
to
a
kala
did
he
want
much
taking
lots
there
was
an
arrangement
of
in
kanats
and
she
was
in
the
next
one
talking
to
which
how
you
know
what
i
mean
the
dowd
and
the
dancing
master
we
could
hear
every
word
and
we
listened
shamelessly
specially
the
hawley
boy
polly
i
quite
love
that
woman
this
is
interesting
there
now
turn
round
what
happened
one
moment
ah
h
blessed
relief
i
ve
been
looking
forward
to
taking
them
off
for
the
last
which
is
ominous
at
my
time
of
life
but
as
i
was
saying
we
listened
and
heard
the
dowd
drawl
worse
than
ever
she
drops
her
final
g
s
like
a
barmaid
or
a
look
you
re
gettin
too
fond
o
me
she
said
and
the
dancing
master
owned
it
was
so
in
language
that
nearly
made
me
ill
the
dowd
reflected
for
a
while
then
we
heard
her
say
look
mister
bent
why
are
you
such
an
liar
i
nearly
exploded
while
the
dancing
master
denied
the
charge
it
seems
that
he
never
told
her
he
was
a
married
i
said
he
wouldn
and
she
had
taken
this
to
heart
on
personal
grounds
i
suppose
she
drawled
along
for
five
minutes
reproaching
him
with
his
perfidy
and
grew
quite
motherly
now
you
ve
got
a
nice
little
wife
of
your
own
you
have
she
said
she
s
ten
times
too
good
for
a
fat
old
man
like
you
and
look
you
never
told
me
a
word
about
her
and
i
ve
been
thinkin
about
it
a
good
deal
and
i
think
you
re
a
wasn
t
that
delicious
the
dancing
master
maundered
and
raved
till
the
hawley
boy
suggested
that
he
should
burst
in
and
beat
him
his
voice
runs
up
into
an
impassioned
squeak
when
he
is
afraid
the
dowd
must
be
an
extraordinary
woman
she
explained
that
had
he
been
a
bachelor
she
might
not
have
objected
to
his
devotion
but
since
he
was
a
married
man
and
the
father
of
a
very
nice
baby
she
considered
him
a
hypocrite
and
this
she
repeated
twice
she
wound
up
her
drawl
with
an
i
m
tellin
you
this
because
your
wife
is
angry
with
me
an
i
hate
quarrellin
with
any
other
woman
an
i
like
your
wife
you
know
how
you
have
behaved
for
the
last
six
weeks
you
shouldn
t
have
done
it
indeed
you
shouldn
t
you
re
too
old
an
too
can
t
you
imagine
how
the
dancing
master
would
wince
at
that
now
go
away
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
because
i
think
you
are
not
nice
i
ll
stay
till
the
next
dance
did
you
think
that
the
creature
had
so
much
in
her
i
never
studied
her
as
closely
as
you
did
it
sounds
unnatural
what
happened
the
dancing
master
attempted
blandishment
reproof
jocularity
and
the
style
of
the
lord
high
warden
and
i
had
almost
to
pinch
the
hawley
boy
to
make
him
keep
quiet
she
grunted
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
and
in
the
end
he
went
away
swearing
to
himself
quite
like
a
man
in
a
novel
he
looked
more
objectionable
than
ever
i
laughed
i
love
that
woman
in
spite
of
her
clothes
and
now
i
m
going
to
bed
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
shan
t
begin
to
think
till
the
morning
said
mallowe
yawning
perhaps
she
spoke
the
truth
they
do
fly
into
it
by
accident
hauksbee
s
account
of
her
eavesdropping
was
an
ornate
one
but
truthful
in
the
main
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
shady
delville
had
turned
upon
mr
bent
and
rent
him
limb
from
limb
casting
him
away
limp
and
disconcerted
ere
she
withdrew
the
light
of
her
eyes
from
him
permanently
being
a
man
of
resource
and
anything
but
pleased
in
that
he
had
been
called
both
old
and
fat
he
gave
mrs
bent
to
understand
that
he
had
during
her
absence
in
the
doon
been
the
victim
of
unceasing
persecution
at
the
hands
of
delville
and
he
told
the
tale
so
often
and
with
such
eloquence
that
he
ended
in
believing
it
while
his
wife
marvelled
at
the
manners
and
customs
of
some
when
the
situation
showed
signs
of
languishing
waddy
was
always
on
hand
to
wake
the
smouldering
fires
of
suspicion
in
bent
s
bosom
and
to
contribute
generally
to
the
peace
and
comfort
of
the
hotel
bent
s
life
was
not
a
happy
one
for
if
waddy
s
story
were
true
he
was
argued
his
wife
untrustworthy
to
the
last
degree
if
his
own
statement
was
true
his
charms
of
manner
and
conversation
were
so
great
that
he
needed
constant
surveillance
and
he
received
it
till
he
repented
genuinely
of
his
marriage
and
neglected
his
personal
appearance
delville
alone
in
the
hotel
was
unchanged
she
removed
her
chair
some
six
paces
towards
the
head
of
the
table
and
occasionally
in
the
twilight
ventured
on
timid
overtures
of
friendship
to
mrs
bent
which
were
repulsed
she
does
it
for
my
sake
hinted
the
virtuous
bent
a
dangerous
and
designing
woman
purred
waddy
worst
of
all
every
other
hotel
in
simla
was
full
polly
are
you
afraid
of
diphtheria
of
nothing
in
the
world
except
diphtheria
kills
but
it
doesn
t
disfigure
why
do
you
ask
because
the
bent
baby
has
got
it
and
the
whole
hotel
is
upside
down
in
consequence
the
waddy
has
set
her
five
young
on
the
rail
and
fled
the
dancing
master
fears
for
his
precious
throat
and
that
miserable
little
woman
his
wife
has
no
notion
of
what
ought
to
be
done
she
wanted
to
put
it
into
a
mustard
bath
for
croup
where
did
you
learn
all
this
just
now
on
the
mall
howlen
told
me
the
manager
of
the
hotel
is
abusing
the
bents
and
the
bents
are
abusing
the
manager
they
are
a
feckless
well
what
s
on
your
mind
this
and
i
know
it
s
a
grave
thing
to
ask
would
you
seriously
object
to
my
bringing
the
child
over
here
with
its
mother
on
the
most
strict
understanding
that
we
see
nothing
of
the
dancing
he
will
be
only
too
glad
to
stay
away
polly
you
re
an
angel
the
woman
really
is
at
her
wits
and
you
know
nothing
about
her
careless
and
would
hold
her
up
to
public
scorn
if
it
gave
you
a
minute
s
amusement
therefore
you
risk
your
life
for
the
sake
of
her
brat
no
loo
i
m
not
the
angel
i
shall
keep
to
my
rooms
and
avoid
her
but
do
as
you
please
only
tell
me
why
you
do
hauksbee
s
eyes
softened
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
back
into
mallowe
s
face
i
don
t
know
said
hauksbee
simply
you
dear
polly
and
for
aught
you
knew
you
might
have
taken
my
fringe
off
never
do
that
again
without
warning
now
we
ll
get
the
rooms
ready
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
be
allowed
to
circulate
in
society
for
a
and
i
also
thank
goodness
i
shall
at
last
get
all
the
sleep
i
much
to
bent
s
surprise
she
and
the
baby
were
brought
over
to
the
house
almost
before
she
knew
where
she
was
bent
was
devoutly
and
undisguisedly
thankful
for
he
was
afraid
of
the
infection
and
also
hoped
that
a
few
weeks
in
the
hotel
alone
with
delville
might
lead
to
explanations
mrs
bent
had
thrown
her
jealousy
to
the
winds
in
her
fear
for
her
child
s
life
we
can
give
you
good
milk
said
hauksbee
to
her
and
our
house
is
much
nearer
to
the
doctor
s
than
the
hotel
and
you
won
t
feel
as
though
you
were
living
in
a
hostile
camp
where
is
the
dear
waddy
she
seemed
to
be
a
particular
friend
of
they
ve
all
left
me
said
mrs
bent
bitterly
mrs
waddy
went
first
she
said
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
introducing
diseases
there
and
i
am
sure
it
wasn
t
my
fault
that
little
dora
how
nice
cooed
hauksbee
the
waddy
is
an
infectious
disease
herself
more
quickly
caught
than
the
plague
and
the
taker
runs
presently
i
lived
next
door
to
her
at
the
elysium
three
years
ago
now
see
you
won
t
give
us
the
least
trouble
and
i
ve
ornamented
all
the
house
with
sheets
soaked
in
carbolic
it
smells
comforting
doesn
t
it
remember
i
m
always
in
call
and
my
ayah
s
at
your
service
when
yours
goes
to
her
meals
and
and
if
you
cry
i
ll
never
forgive
dora
bent
occupied
her
mother
s
unprofitable
attention
through
the
day
and
the
night
the
doctor
called
thrice
in
the
hours
and
the
house
reeked
with
the
smell
of
the
condy
s
fluid
and
carbolic
acid
washes
mallowe
kept
to
her
own
rooms
she
considered
that
she
had
made
sufficient
concessions
in
the
cause
of
humanity
and
hauksbee
was
more
esteemed
by
the
doctor
as
a
help
in
the
than
the
mother
i
know
nothing
of
illness
said
hauksbee
to
the
doctor
only
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
ll
do
keep
that
crazy
woman
from
kissing
the
child
and
let
her
have
as
little
to
do
with
the
nursing
as
you
possibly
can
said
the
doctor
i
d
turn
her
out
of
the
but
that
i
honestly
believe
she
d
die
of
anxiety
she
is
less
than
no
good
and
i
depend
on
you
and
the
ayahs
hauksbee
accepted
the
responsibility
though
it
painted
olive
hollows
under
her
eyes
and
forced
her
to
her
oldest
dresses
mrs
bent
clung
to
her
with
more
than
childlike
faith
i
know
you
ll
make
dora
well
won
t
you
she
said
at
least
twenty
times
a
day
and
twenty
times
a
day
hauksbee
answered
valiantly
of
course
i
but
dora
did
not
improve
and
the
doctor
seemed
to
be
always
in
the
house
there
s
some
danger
of
the
thing
taking
a
bad
turn
he
said
i
ll
come
over
between
three
and
four
in
the
morning
good
gracious
said
hauksbee
he
never
told
me
what
the
turn
would
be
my
education
has
been
horribly
neglected
and
i
have
only
this
foolish
to
fall
back
the
night
wore
through
slowly
and
hauksbee
dozed
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
there
was
a
dance
at
the
viceregal
lodge
and
she
dreamed
of
it
till
she
was
aware
of
bent
s
anxious
eyes
staring
into
her
own
wake
up
wake
up
do
something
cried
mrs
bent
piteously
dora
s
choking
to
death
do
you
mean
to
let
her
die
hauksbee
jumped
to
her
feet
and
bent
over
the
bed
the
child
was
fighting
for
breath
while
the
mother
wrung
her
hands
despairingly
oh
what
can
i
do
what
can
you
do
she
won
t
stay
still
i
can
t
hold
her
why
didn
t
the
doctor
say
this
was
coming
screamed
mrs
bent
won
t
you
help
me
she
s
dying
i
i
ve
never
seen
a
child
die
before
stammered
hauksbee
feebly
and
then
let
none
blame
her
weakness
after
the
strain
of
long
watching
she
broke
down
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
ayahs
on
the
threshold
snored
peacefully
there
was
a
rattle
of
rickshaw
wheels
below
the
clash
of
an
opening
door
a
heavy
step
on
the
stairs
and
delville
entered
to
find
mrs
bent
screaming
for
the
doctor
as
she
ran
round
the
room
hauksbee
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
her
face
buried
in
the
chintz
of
a
chair
was
quivering
with
pain
at
each
cry
from
the
bed
and
murmuring
thank
god
i
never
bore
a
child
oh
thank
god
i
never
bore
a
child
delville
looked
at
the
bed
for
an
instant
took
mrs
bent
by
the
shoulders
and
said
quietly
get
me
some
caustic
be
the
mother
obeyed
mechanically
delville
had
thrown
herself
down
by
the
side
of
the
child
and
was
opening
its
mouth
oh
you
re
killing
her
cried
mrs
bent
where
s
the
doctor
leave
her
alone
delville
made
no
reply
for
a
minute
but
busied
herself
with
the
child
now
the
caustic
and
hold
a
lamp
behind
my
shoulder
will
you
do
as
you
are
told
the
if
you
don
t
know
what
i
mean
she
said
a
second
time
delville
bent
over
the
child
hauksbee
her
face
still
hidden
sobbed
and
shivered
one
of
the
ayahs
staggered
sleepily
into
the
room
yawning
doctor
sahib
delville
turned
her
head
you
re
only
just
in
time
she
said
it
was
chokin
her
when
i
came
an
i
ve
burnt
there
was
no
sign
of
the
membrane
getting
to
the
after
the
last
steaming
it
was
the
general
weakness
i
feared
said
the
doctor
half
to
himself
and
he
whispered
as
he
looked
you
ve
done
what
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
do
without
she
was
dyin
said
delville
under
her
breath
can
you
do
anythin
what
a
mercy
it
was
i
went
to
the
dance
hauksbee
raised
her
head
is
it
all
over
she
gasped
i
m
useless
i
m
worse
than
useless
what
are
you
doing
here
she
stared
at
delville
and
mrs
bent
realising
for
the
first
time
who
was
the
goddess
from
the
machine
stared
also
then
delville
made
explanation
putting
on
a
dirty
long
glove
and
smoothing
a
crumpled
and
i
was
at
the
dance
an
the
doctor
was
tellin
me
about
your
baby
bein
so
ill
so
i
came
away
early
an
your
door
was
open
an
i
i
lost
my
boy
this
way
six
months
ago
an
i
ve
been
tryin
to
forget
it
ever
since
an
i
i
i
am
very
sorry
for
intrudin
an
anythin
that
has
mrs
bent
was
putting
out
the
doctor
s
eye
with
a
lamp
as
he
stooped
over
dora
take
it
away
said
the
doctor
i
think
the
child
will
do
thanks
to
you
delville
i
should
have
come
too
late
but
i
assure
you
he
was
addressing
himself
to
delville
i
had
not
the
faintest
reason
to
expect
this
the
membrane
must
have
grown
like
a
mushroom
will
one
of
you
help
me
please
he
had
reason
for
the
last
sentence
hauksbee
had
thrown
herself
into
delville
s
arms
where
she
was
weeping
bitterly
and
mrs
bent
was
unpicturesquely
mixed
up
with
both
while
from
the
tangle
came
the
sound
of
many
sobs
and
much
promiscuous
kissing
good
gracious
i
ve
spoilt
all
your
beautiful
roses
said
hauksbee
lifting
her
head
from
the
lump
of
crushed
gum
and
calico
atrocities
on
delville
s
shoulder
and
hurrying
to
the
doctor
delville
picked
up
her
shawl
and
slouched
out
of
the
room
mopping
her
eyes
with
the
glove
that
she
had
not
put
on
i
always
said
she
was
more
than
a
woman
sobbed
hauksbee
hysterically
and
that
proves
it
six
weeks
later
mrs
bent
and
dora
had
returned
to
the
hotel
hauksbee
had
come
out
of
the
valley
of
humiliation
had
ceased
to
reproach
herself
for
her
collapse
in
an
hour
of
need
and
was
even
beginning
to
direct
the
affairs
of
the
world
as
before
so
nobody
died
and
everything
went
off
as
it
should
and
i
kissed
the
dowd
polly
i
feel
so
old
does
it
show
in
my
face
kisses
don
t
as
a
rule
do
they
of
course
you
know
what
the
result
of
the
dowd
s
providential
arrival
has
they
ought
to
build
her
a
statue
only
no
sculptor
dare
copy
those
ah
said
mallowe
quietly
she
has
found
another
reward
the
dancing
master
has
been
smirking
through
simla
giving
every
one
to
understand
that
she
came
because
of
her
undying
love
for
him
for
him
to
save
his
child
and
all
simla
naturally
believes
but
mrs
bent
mrs
bent
believes
it
more
than
any
one
else
she
won
t
speak
to
the
dowd
now
isn
t
the
dancing
master
an
angel
hauksbee
lifted
up
her
voice
and
raged
till
the
doors
of
the
two
rooms
stood
open
polly
said
a
voice
from
the
darkness
what
did
that
girl
say
last
season
when
she
was
tipped
out
of
her
rickshaw
turning
a
corner
some
absurd
adjective
that
made
the
man
who
picked
her
up
paltry
said
mallowe
through
her
nose
like
this
pahltry
exactly
said
the
voice
pahltry
it
all
is
which
everything
babies
diphtheria
mrs
bent
and
the
dancing
master
i
whooping
in
a
chair
and
the
dowd
dropping
in
from
the
clouds
i
wonder
what
the
motive
was
all
the
um
what
do
you
think
don
t
ask
me
go
to
only
a
subaltern
not
only
to
enforce
by
command
but
to
encourage
by
example
the
energetic
discharge
of
duty
and
the
steady
endurance
of
the
difficulties
and
privations
inseparable
from
military
service
bengal
army
regulations
they
made
bobby
wick
pass
an
examination
at
sandhurst
he
was
a
gentleman
before
he
was
gazetted
so
when
the
empress
announced
that
robert
hanna
wick
was
posted
as
second
lieutenant
to
the
tyneside
tail
twisters
at
krab
bokhar
he
became
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
which
is
an
enviable
thing
and
there
was
joy
in
the
house
of
wick
where
mamma
wick
and
all
the
little
wicks
fell
upon
their
knees
and
offered
incense
to
bobby
by
virtue
of
his
achievements
papa
wick
had
been
a
commissioner
in
his
day
holding
authority
over
three
millions
of
men
in
the
division
building
great
works
for
the
good
of
the
land
and
doing
his
best
to
make
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
there
was
but
one
before
of
course
nobody
knew
anything
about
this
in
the
little
english
village
where
he
was
just
old
wick
and
had
forgotten
that
he
was
a
companion
of
the
order
of
the
star
of
india
he
patted
bobby
on
the
shoulder
and
said
well
done
my
boy
there
followed
while
the
uniform
was
being
prepared
an
interval
of
pure
delight
during
which
bobby
took
as
a
man
at
the
and
of
the
village
and
i
daresay
had
his
been
extended
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
several
girls
at
once
little
country
villages
at
home
are
very
full
of
nice
girls
because
all
the
young
men
come
out
to
india
to
make
their
fortunes
india
said
papa
wick
is
the
place
i
ve
had
thirty
years
of
it
and
begad
i
d
like
to
go
back
again
when
you
join
the
tail
twisters
you
ll
be
among
friends
if
every
one
hasn
t
forgotten
wick
of
and
a
lot
of
people
will
be
kind
to
you
for
our
sakes
the
mother
will
tell
you
more
about
outfit
than
i
can
but
remember
this
stick
to
your
regiment
bobby
stick
to
your
regiment
you
ll
see
men
all
round
you
going
into
the
staff
corps
and
doing
every
possible
sort
of
duty
but
regimental
and
you
may
be
tempted
to
follow
suit
now
so
long
as
you
keep
within
your
allowance
and
i
haven
t
stinted
you
there
stick
to
the
line
the
whole
line
and
nothing
but
the
line
be
careful
how
you
back
another
young
fool
s
bill
and
if
you
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
twenty
years
older
than
yourself
don
t
tell
me
about
it
that
s
with
these
counsels
and
many
others
equally
valuable
did
papa
wick
fortify
bobby
ere
that
last
awful
night
at
portsmouth
when
the
officers
quarters
held
more
inmates
than
were
provided
for
by
the
regulations
and
the
of
the
ships
fell
foul
of
the
drafts
for
india
and
the
battle
raged
from
the
dockyard
gates
even
to
the
slums
of
longport
while
the
drabs
of
fratton
came
down
and
scratched
the
faces
of
the
queen
s
officers
bobby
wick
with
an
ugly
bruise
on
his
freckled
nose
a
sick
and
shaky
detachment
to
manuvre
in
ship
and
the
comfort
of
fifty
scornful
females
to
attend
to
had
no
time
to
feel
till
the
malabar
reached
when
he
doubled
his
emotions
with
a
little
and
a
great
many
other
matters
the
tail
twisters
were
a
most
particular
regiment
those
who
knew
them
least
said
that
they
were
eaten
up
with
but
their
reserve
and
their
internal
arrangements
generally
were
merely
protective
diplomacy
some
five
years
before
the
colonel
commanding
had
looked
into
the
fourteen
fearless
eyes
of
seven
plump
and
juicy
subalterns
who
had
all
applied
to
enter
the
staff
corps
and
had
asked
them
why
the
three
stars
should
he
a
colonel
of
the
line
command
a
dashed
nursery
for
who
put
on
condemned
tin
spurs
and
rode
qualified
mokes
at
the
hiatused
heads
of
forsaken
black
regiments
he
was
a
rude
man
and
a
terrible
wherefore
the
remnant
took
measures
with
the
as
an
engine
of
public
opinion
till
the
rumour
went
abroad
that
young
men
who
used
the
tail
twisters
as
a
crutch
to
the
staff
corps
had
many
and
varied
trials
to
endure
however
a
regiment
had
just
as
much
right
to
its
own
secrets
as
a
woman
when
bobby
came
up
from
deolali
and
took
his
place
among
the
tail
twisters
it
was
gently
but
firmly
borne
in
upon
him
that
the
regiment
was
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
indissolubly
wedded
wife
and
that
there
was
no
crime
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
blacker
than
that
of
bringing
shame
on
the
regiment
which
was
the
bravest
most
illustrious
and
in
all
respects
most
desirable
regiment
within
the
compass
of
the
seven
seas
he
was
taught
the
legends
of
the
mess
plate
from
the
great
grinning
golden
gods
that
had
come
out
of
the
summer
palace
in
pekin
to
the
presented
by
the
last
he
who
spake
to
the
seven
subalterns
and
every
one
of
those
legends
told
him
of
battles
fought
at
long
odds
without
fear
as
without
support
of
hospitality
catholic
as
an
arab
s
of
friendships
deep
as
the
sea
and
steady
as
the
of
honour
won
by
hard
roads
for
honour
s
sake
and
of
instant
and
unquestioning
devotion
to
the
regiment
the
regiment
that
claims
the
lives
of
all
and
lives
for
ever
more
than
once
too
he
came
officially
into
contact
with
the
regimental
colours
which
looked
like
the
lining
of
a
bricklayer
s
hat
on
the
end
of
a
chewed
stick
bobby
did
not
kneel
and
worship
them
because
british
subalterns
are
not
constructed
in
that
manner
indeed
he
condemned
them
for
their
weight
at
the
very
moment
that
they
were
filling
with
awe
and
other
more
noble
sentiments
but
best
of
all
was
the
occasion
when
he
moved
with
the
tail
twisters
in
review
order
at
the
breaking
of
a
november
day
allowing
for
and
sick
the
regiment
was
one
thousand
and
eighty
strong
and
bobby
belonged
to
them
for
was
he
not
a
subaltern
of
the
line
the
whole
line
and
nothing
but
the
line
as
the
tramp
of
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
sixty
sturdy
ammunition
boots
attested
he
would
not
have
changed
places
with
deighton
of
the
horse
battery
whirling
by
in
a
pillar
of
cloud
to
a
chorus
of
strong
right
strong
left
or
of
the
white
hussars
leading
his
squadron
for
all
it
was
worth
with
the
price
of
horseshoes
thrown
in
or
tick
boileau
trying
to
live
up
to
his
fierce
blue
and
gold
turban
while
the
wasps
of
the
bengal
cavalry
stretched
to
a
gallop
in
the
wake
of
the
long
lollopping
walers
of
the
white
hussars
they
fought
through
the
clear
cool
day
and
bobby
felt
a
little
thrill
run
down
his
spine
when
he
heard
the
of
the
empty
hopping
from
the
after
the
roar
of
the
volleys
for
he
knew
that
he
should
live
to
hear
that
sound
in
action
the
review
ended
in
a
glorious
chase
across
the
plain
batteries
thundering
after
cavalry
to
the
huge
disgust
of
the
white
hussars
and
the
tyneside
tail
twisters
hunting
a
sikh
regiment
till
the
lean
lathy
singhs
panted
with
exhaustion
bobby
was
dusty
and
dripping
long
before
noon
but
his
enthusiasm
was
merely
focused
not
diminished
he
returned
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
revere
his
skipper
that
is
to
say
the
captain
of
his
company
and
to
be
instructed
in
the
dark
art
and
mystery
of
managing
men
which
is
a
very
large
part
of
the
profession
of
arms
if
you
haven
t
a
taste
that
way
said
revere
between
his
puffs
of
his
cheroot
you
ll
never
be
able
to
get
the
hang
of
it
but
remember
bobby
t
isn
t
the
best
drill
though
drill
is
nearly
everything
that
hauls
a
regiment
through
hell
and
out
on
the
other
side
it
s
the
man
who
knows
how
to
handle
men
and
so
dormer
for
instance
said
bobby
i
think
he
comes
under
the
head
of
he
mopes
like
a
sick
that
s
where
you
make
your
mistake
my
son
dormer
isn
t
a
fool
yet
but
he
s
a
dashed
dirty
soldier
and
his
room
corporal
makes
fun
of
his
socks
before
dormer
being
pure
brute
goes
into
a
corner
and
how
do
you
know
said
bobby
admiringly
because
a
company
commander
has
to
know
these
things
because
if
he
does
not
know
he
may
have
crime
ay
murder
brewing
under
his
very
nose
and
yet
not
see
that
it
s
there
dormer
is
being
badgered
out
of
his
mind
big
as
he
is
and
he
hasn
t
intellect
enough
to
resent
it
he
s
taken
to
quiet
boozing
and
bobby
when
the
butt
of
a
room
goes
on
the
drink
or
takes
to
moping
by
himself
measures
are
necessary
to
pull
him
out
of
what
measures
man
can
t
run
round
coddling
his
men
for
no
the
men
would
precious
soon
show
him
that
he
was
not
wanted
you
ve
got
to
here
the
entered
with
some
papers
bobby
reflected
for
a
while
as
revere
looked
through
the
company
forms
does
dormer
do
anything
sergeant
bobby
asked
with
the
air
of
one
continuing
an
interrupted
conversation
no
sir
does
is
dooty
like
a
hortomato
said
the
sergeant
who
delighted
in
long
words
a
dirty
soldier
and
e
s
under
full
stoppages
for
new
kit
it
s
covered
with
scales
scales
what
scales
sir
e
s
always
pokin
in
the
mud
by
the
river
an
them
with
is
revere
was
still
absorbed
in
the
company
papers
and
the
sergeant
who
was
sternly
fond
of
bobby
continued
e
generally
goes
down
there
when
e
s
got
is
skinful
beggin
your
pardon
sir
an
they
do
say
that
the
more
lush
e
is
the
more
fish
e
catches
they
call
im
the
looney
fishmonger
in
the
comp
ny
revere
signed
the
last
paper
and
the
sergeant
retreated
it
s
a
filthy
amusement
sighed
bobby
to
himself
then
aloud
to
revere
are
you
really
worried
about
dormer
a
little
you
see
he
s
never
mad
enough
to
send
to
hospital
or
drunk
enough
to
run
in
but
at
any
minute
he
may
flare
up
brooding
and
sulking
as
he
does
he
resents
any
interest
being
shown
in
him
and
the
only
time
i
took
him
out
shooting
he
all
but
shot
me
by
i
fish
said
bobby
with
a
wry
face
i
hire
a
and
go
down
the
river
from
thursday
to
sunday
and
the
amiable
dormer
goes
with
me
if
you
can
spare
us
you
blazing
young
fool
said
revere
but
his
heart
was
full
of
much
more
pleasant
words
bobby
the
captain
of
a
dhoni
with
private
dormer
for
mate
dropped
down
the
river
on
thursday
morning
the
private
at
the
bow
the
subaltern
at
the
helm
the
private
glared
uneasily
at
the
subaltern
who
respected
the
reserve
of
the
private
after
six
hours
dormer
paced
to
the
stern
saluted
and
said
beg
y
pardon
sir
but
was
you
ever
on
the
durh
m
canal
no
said
bobby
wick
come
and
have
some
they
ate
in
silence
as
the
evening
fell
private
dormer
broke
forth
speaking
to
himself
hi
was
on
the
durh
m
canal
jes
such
a
night
come
next
week
twelve
month
of
my
toes
in
the
he
smoked
and
said
no
more
till
bedtime
the
witchery
of
the
dawn
turned
the
gray
to
purple
gold
and
opal
and
it
was
as
though
the
lumbering
dhoni
crept
across
the
splendours
of
a
new
heaven
private
dormer
popped
his
head
out
of
his
blanket
and
gazed
at
the
glory
below
and
around
well
damn
my
eyes
said
private
dormer
in
an
awed
whisper
this
ere
is
like
a
bloomin
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
dumb
but
achieved
an
ensanguined
filthiness
through
the
cleaning
of
big
fish
the
boat
returned
on
saturday
evening
dormer
had
been
struggling
with
speech
since
noon
as
the
lines
and
luggage
were
being
disembarked
he
found
tongue
beg
y
pardon
sir
he
said
but
would
you
would
you
min
shakin
ands
with
me
sir
of
course

said
bobby
and
he
shook
accordingly
dormer
returned
to
barracks
and
bobby
to
mess
he
wanted
a
little
quiet
and
some
fishing
i
think
said
bobby
my
aunt
but
he
s
a
filthy
sort
of
animal
have
you
ever
seen
him
clean
them
with
is
thumbs
anyhow
said
revere
three
weeks
later
he
s
doing
his
best
to
keep
his
things
when
the
spring
died
bobby
joined
in
the
general
scramble
for
hill
leave
and
to
his
surprise
and
delight
secured
three
months
as
good
a
boy
as
i
want
said
revere
the
admiring
skipper
the
best
of
the
batch
said
the
adjutant
to
the
colonel
keep
back
that
young
porkiss
sir
and
let
revere
make
him
sit
so
bobby
departed
joyously
to
simla
pahar
with
a
tin
box
of
gorgeous
raiment
son
of
wick
old
wick
of
ask
him
to
dinner
dear
said
the
aged
men
what
a
nice
boy
said
the
matrons
and
the
maids
place
simla
oh
ripping
said
bobby
wick
and
ordered
new
white
cord
breeches
on
the
strength
of
it
we
re
in
a
bad
way
wrote
revere
to
bobby
at
the
end
of
two
months
since
you
left
the
regiment
has
taken
to
fever
and
is
fairly
rotten
with
it
two
hundred
in
hospital
about
a
hundred
in
cells
drinking
to
keep
off
fever
and
the
companies
on
parade
fifteen
file
strong
at
the
outside
there
s
rather
more
sickness
in
the
than
i
care
for
but
then
i
m
so
blistered
with
that
i
m
ready
to
hang
myself
what
s
the
yarn
about
your
mashing
a
miss
haverley
up
there
not
serious
i
hope
you
re
to
hang
millstones
round
your
neck
and
the
colonel
will
turf
you
out
of
that
in
time
if
you
attempt
it
was
not
the
colonel
that
brought
bobby
out
of
simla
but
a
commandant
the
sickness
in
the
spread
the
bazar
was
put
out
of
bounds
and
then
came
the
news
that
the
tail
twisters
must
go
into
camp
the
message
flashed
to
the
hill
stations
cholera
leave
stopped
officers
alas
for
the
white
gloves
in
the
boxes
the
rides
and
the
dances
and
picnics
that
were
to
be
the
loves
half
spoken
and
the
debts
unpaid
without
demur
and
without
question
fast
as
tonga
could
fly
or
pony
gallop
back
to
their
regiments
and
their
batteries
as
though
they
were
hastening
to
their
weddings
fled
the
subalterns
bobby
received
his
orders
on
returning
from
a
dance
at
viceregal
lodge
where
he
had
but
only
the
haverley
girl
knows
what
bobby
had
said
or
how
many
waltzes
he
had
claimed
for
the
next
ball
six
in
the
morning
saw
bobby
at
the
tonga
office
in
the
drenching
rain
the
whirl
of
the
last
waltz
still
in
his
ears
and
an
intoxication
due
neither
to
wine
nor
waltzing
in
his
brain
good
man
shouted
deighton
of
the
horse
battery
through
the
mist
whar
you
raise
dat
tonga
i
m
coming
with
you
ow
but
i
ve
a
head
and
a
half
i
didn
t
sit
out
all
night
they
say
the
battery
s
awful
bad
and
he
hummed
dolorously
leave
the
what
at
the
what
leave
the
flock
without
shelter
leave
the
corpse
uninterred
leave
the
bride
at
the
altar
my
faith
it
ll
be
more
bally
corpse
than
bride
though
this
journey
jump
in
bobby
get
on
coachwan
on
the
umballa
platform
waited
a
detachment
of
officers
discussing
the
latest
news
from
the
stricken
cantonment
and
it
was
here
that
bobby
learned
the
real
condition
of
the
tail
twisters
they
went
into
camp
said
an
elderly
major
recalled
from
the
at
mussoorie
to
a
sickly
native
regiment
they
went
into
camp
with
two
hundred
and
ten
sick
in
carts
two
hundred
and
ten
fever
cases
only
and
the
balance
looking
like
so
many
ghosts
with
sore
eyes
a
madras
regiment
could
have
walked
through
but
they
were
as
fit
as
when
i
left
them
said
bobby
then
you
d
better
make
them
as
fit
as
bedamned
when
you
rejoin
said
the
major
brutally
bobby
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
as
the
train
lumbered
across
the
sodden
doab
and
prayed
for
the
health
of
the
tyneside
tail
twisters
naini
tal
had
sent
down
her
contingent
with
all
speed
the
lathering
ponies
of
the
dalhousie
road
staggered
into
pathankot
taxed
to
the
full
stretch
of
their
strength
while
from
cloudy
darjiling
the
calcutta
mail
whirled
up
the
last
straggler
of
the
little
army
that
was
to
fight
a
fight
in
which
was
neither
medal
nor
honour
for
the
winning
against
an
enemy
none
other
than
the
sickness
that
destroyeth
in
the
and
as
each
man
reported
himself
he
said
this
is
a
bad
business
and
went
about
his
own
forthwith
for
every
regiment
and
battery
in
the
cantonment
was
under
canvas
the
sickness
bearing
them
company
bobby
fought
his
way
through
the
rain
to
the
tail
twisters
temporary
mess
and
revere
could
have
fallen
on
the
boy
s
neck
for
the
joy
of
seeing
that
ugly
wholesome
phiz
once
more
keep
em
amused
and
interested
said
revere
they
went
on
the
drink
poor
fools
after
the
first
two
cases
and
there
was
no
improvement
oh
it
s
good
to
have
you
back
bobby
porkiss
is
a
never
deighton
came
over
from
the
artillery
camp
to
attend
a
dreary
mess
dinner
and
contributed
to
the
general
gloom
by
nearly
weeping
over
the
condition
of
his
beloved
battery
porkiss
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
insinuate
that
the
presence
of
the
officers
could
do
no
earthly
good
and
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
send
the
entire
regiment
into
hospital
and
let
the
doctors
look
after
porkiss
was
demoralised
with
fear
nor
was
his
peace
of
mind
restored
when
revere
said
coldly
oh
the
sooner
you
go
out
the
better
if
that
s
your
way
of
thinking
any
public
school
could
send
us
fifty
good
men
in
your
place
but
it
takes
time
time
porkiss
and
money
and
a
certain
amount
of
trouble
to
make
a
regiment
s
pose
you
re
the
person
we
go
into
camp
for
eh
whereupon
porkiss
was
overtaken
with
a
great
and
chilly
fear
which
a
drenching
in
the
rain
did
not
allay
and
two
days
later
quitted
this
world
for
another
where
men
do
fondly
hope
allowances
are
made
for
the
weaknesses
of
the
flesh
the
regimental
looked
wearily
across
the
sergeants
mess
tent
when
the
news
was
announced
there
goes
the
worst
of
them
he
said
it
ll
take
the
best
and
then
please
god
it
ll
the
sergeants
were
silent
till
one
said
it
couldn
t
be
him
and
all
knew
of
whom
travis
was
thinking
bobby
wick
stormed
through
the
tents
of
his
company
rallying
rebuking
mildly
as
is
consistent
with
the
regulations
chaffing
the
haling
the
sound
into
the
watery
sunlight
when
there
was
a
break
in
the
weather
and
bidding
them
be
of
good
cheer
for
their
trouble
was
nearly
at
an
end
scuttling
on
his
dun
pony
round
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
and
heading
back
men
who
with
the
innate
perversity
of
british
soldiers
were
always
wandering
into
infected
villages
or
drinking
deeply
from
marshes
comforting
the
with
rude
speech
and
more
than
once
tending
the
dying
who
had
no
friends
the
men
without
townies
organising
with
banjos
and
burnt
cork
which
should
allow
the
talent
of
the
regiment
full
play
and
generally
as
he
explained
playing
the
giddy
all
you
re
worth
of
us
bobby
said
revere
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
how
the
devil
do
you
keep
it
up
bobby
made
no
answer
but
had
revere
looked
into
the
of
his
coat
he
might
have
seen
there
a
sheaf
of
letters
which
perhaps
accounted
for
the
power
that
possessed
the
boy
a
letter
came
to
bobby
every
other
day
the
spelling
was
not
above
reproach
but
the
sentiments
must
have
been
most
satisfactory
for
on
receipt
bobby
s
eyes
softened
marvellously
and
he
was
wont
to
fall
into
a
tender
abstraction
for
a
while
ere
shaking
his
cropped
head
he
charged
into
his
work
by
what
power
he
drew
after
him
the
hearts
of
the
roughest
and
the
tail
twisters
counted
in
their
ranks
some
rough
diamonds
indeed
was
a
mystery
to
both
skipper
and
who
learned
from
the
regimental
chaplain
that
bobby
was
considerably
more
in
request
in
the
hospital
tents
than
the
reverend
john
emery
the
men
seem
fond
of
you
are
you
in
the
hospitals
much
said
the
colonel
who
did
his
daily
round
and
ordered
the
men
to
get
well
with
a
hardness
that
did
not
cover
his
bitter
grief
a
little
sir
said
bobby
shouldn
t
go
there
too
often
if
i
were
you
they
say
it
s
not
contagious
but
there
s
no
use
in
running
unnecessary
risks
we
can
t
afford
to
have
you
down
y
six
days
later
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
the
plashed
his
way
out
to
the
camp
with
the
for
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
bobby
received
a
letter
bore
it
off
to
his
tent
and
the
programme
for
the
next
week
s
being
satisfactorily
disposed
of
sat
down
to
answer
it
for
an
hour
the
unhandy
pen
toiled
over
the
paper
and
where
sentiment
rose
to
more
than
normal
bobby
wick
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
breathed
heavily
he
was
not
used
to
beg
y
pardon
sir
said
a
voice
at
the
tent
door
but
dormer
s
orrid
bad
sir
an
they

taken

orf
damn
private
dormer
and

bobby
wick
running
the
blotter
over
the
letter
tell
him
i
ll
come
in
the
e
s
awful
bad
sir
said
the
voice
hesitatingly
there
was
an
undecided
squelching
of
heavy
boots
well
said
bobby
impatiently
excusin
imself
before
and
for
takin
the
liberty
e
says
it
would
be
a
comfort
for
to
assist
im
sir

of

on
to
my
stirrup
and
tell
me
if
i
go
too
strengthened
by
a
nip
which
he
swallowed
without
a
wink
the
hospital
orderly
kept
up
with
the
slipping
and
very
disgusted
pony
as
it
shambled
to
the
hospital
tent
private
dormer
was
certainly
orrid
he
had
all
but
reached
the
stage
of
collapse
and
was
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
what
s
this
dormer
said
bobby
bending
over
the
man
you
re
not
going
out
this
time
you
ve
got
to
come
fishing
with
me
once
or
twice
more
the
blue
lips
parted
and
in
the
ghost
of
a
whisper
said
beg
y
pardon
sir
disturbin
of
you
now
but
would
you
min
oldin
my
and
sir
bobby
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
the
icy
cold
hand
closed
on
his
own
like
a
vice
forcing
a
lady
s
ring
which
was
on
the
little
finger
deep
into
the
flesh
bobby
set
his
lips
and
waited
the
water
dripping
from
the
hem
of
his
trousers
an
hour
passed
and
the
grasp
of
the
hand
did
not
relax
nor
did
the
expression
of
the
drawn
face
change
bobby
with
infinite
craft
lit
himself
a
cheroot
with
the
left
hand
his
right
arm
was
numbed
to
the
elbow
and
resigned
himself
to
a
night
of
pain
dawn
showed
a
very
subaltern
sitting
on
the
side
of
a
sick
man
s
cot
and
a
doctor
in
the
doorway
using
language
unfit
for
publication
have
you
been
here
all
night
you
young
ass
said
the
doctor
there
or
thereabouts
said
bobby
ruefully
he
s
frozen
on
to
dormer
s
mouth
shut
with
a
click
he
turned
his
head
and
sighed
the
clinging
hand
opened
and
bobby
s
arm
fell
useless
at
his
side
he
ll
do
said
the
doctor
quietly
it
must
have
been
a
all
through
the
night
think
you
re
to
be
congratulated
on
this
oh
bosh
said
bobby
i
thought
the
man
had
gone
out
long
ago
only
only
i
didn
t
care
to
take
my
hand
away
rub
my
arm
down
there
s
a
good
chap
what
a
grip
the
brute
has
i
m
chilled
to
the
marrow
he
passed
out
of
the
tent
shivering
private
dormer
was
allowed
to
celebrate
his
repulse
of
death
by
strong
waters
four
days
later
he
sat
on
the
side
of
his
cot
and
said
to
the
patients
mildly
i
d
a
liken
to
a
spoken
to
im
so
i
but
at
that
time
bobby
was
reading
yet
another
letter
he
had
the
most
persistent
correspondent
of
any
man
in
camp
and
was
even
then
about
to
write
that
the
sickness
had
abated
and
in
another
week
at
the
outside
would
be
gone
he
did
not
intend
to
say
that
the
chill
of
a
sick
man
s
hand
seemed
to
have
struck
into
the
heart
whose
capacities
for
affection
he
dwelt
on
at
such
length
he
did
intend
to
enclose
the
illustrated
programme
of
the
forthcoming
whereof
he
was
not
a
little
proud
he
also
intended
to
write
on
many
other
matters
which
do
not
concern
us
and
doubtless
would
have
done
so
but
for
the
slight
feverish
headache
which
made
him
dull
and
unresponsive
at
mess
you
are
overdoing
it
bobby
said
his
skipper
might
give
the
rest
of
us
credit
of
doing
a
little
work
you
go
on
as
if
you
were
the
whole
mess
rolled
into
one
take
it
i
will
said
bobby
i
m
feeling
done
up
revere
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
said
nothing
there
was
a
flickering
of
lanterns
about
the
camp
that
night
and
a
rumour
that
brought
men
out
of
their
cots
to
the
tent
doors
a
paddling
of
the
naked
feet
of
and
the
rush
of
a
galloping
horse
wot
s
up
asked
twenty
tents
and
through
twenty
tents
ran
the
answer
wick
e
s
they
brought
the
news
to
revere
and
he
groaned
any
one
but
bobby
and
i
shouldn
t
have
cared
the
was
not
going
out
this
journey
gasped
bobby
as
he
was
lifted
from
the
doolie
not
going
out
this
then
with
an
air
of
supreme
conviction
i
can
t
you
not
if
i
can
do
anything
said
the
who
had
hastened
over
from
the
mess
where
he
had
been
dining
he
and
the
regimental
surgeon
fought
together
with
death
for
the
life
of
bobby
wick
their
work
was
interrupted
by
a
hairy
apparition
in
a
bluegray
who
stared
in
horror
at
the
bed
and
cried
oh
my
gawd
it
can
t
be
im
until
an
indignant
hospital
orderly
whisked
him
away
if
care
of
man
and
desire
to
live
could
have
done
aught
bobby
would
have
been
saved
as
it
was
he
made
a
fight
of
three
days
and
the
s
brow
uncreased
we
ll
save
him
yet
he
said
and
the
surgeon
who
though
he
ranked
with
the
captain
had
a
very
youthful
heart
went
out
upon
the
word
and
pranced
joyously
in
the
mud
not
going
out
this
journey
whispered
bobby
wick
gallantly
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
bravo
said
the
that
s
the
way
to
look
at
it
as
evening
fell
a
gray
shade
gathered
round
bobby
s
mouth
and
he
turned
his
face
to
the
tent
wall
wearily
the
frowned
i
m
awfully
tired
said
bobby
very
faintly
what
s
the
use
of
bothering
me
with
medicine
i
don
t
want
it
let
me
the
desire
for
life
had
departed
and
bobby
was
content
to
drift
away
on
the
easy
tide
of
death
it
s
no
good
said
the
he
doesn
t
want
to
live
he
s
meeting
it
poor
and
he
blew
his
nose
half
a
mile
away
the
regimental
band
was
playing
the
overture
to
the
for
the
men
had
been
told
that
bobby
was
out
of
danger
the
clash
of
the
brass
and
the
wail
of
the
horns
reached
bobby
s
ears
is
there
a
single
joy
or
pain
that
i
should
never
you
do
not
love
me
tis
in
vain
bid
me
and
go
an
expression
of
hopeless
irritation
crossed
the
boy
s
face
and
he
tried
to
shake
his
head
the
bent
down
what
is
it
bobby
not
that
waltz
muttered
bobby
that
s
our
own
our
very
ownest
own
mummy
with
this
he
sank
into
the
stupor
that
gave
place
to
death
early
next
morning
revere
his
eyes
red
at
the
rims
and
his
nose
very
white
went
into
bobby
s
tent
to
write
a
letter
to
papa
wick
which
should
bow
the
white
head
of
the
of
in
the
keenest
sorrow
of
his
life
bobby
s
little
store
of
papers
lay
in
confusion
on
the
table
and
among
them
a
letter
the
last
sentence
ran
so
you
see
darling
there
is
really
no
fear
because
as
long
as
i
know
you
care
for
me
and
i
care
for
you
nothing
can
touch
revere
stayed
in
the
tent
for
an
hour
when
he
came
out
his
eyes
were
redder
than
ever
private
conklin
sat
on
a
bucket
and
listened
to
a
not
unfamiliar
tune
private
conklin
was
a
convalescent
and
should
have
been
tenderly
treated
ho
said
private
conklin
there
s
another
bloomin
orf
cer
da
the
bucket
shot
from
under
him
and
his
eyes
filled
with
a
smithyful
of
sparks
a
tall
man
in
a
bedgown
was
regarding
him
with
deep
disfavour
you
ought
to
take
shame
for
yourself
conky
orf

i
ll
learn
you
to
misname
the

that
s
wot

is
and
the
hospital
orderly
was
so
satisfied
with
the
justice
of
the
punishment
that
he
did
not
even
order
private
dormer
back
to
his
cot
in
the
matter
of

hurrah

for
me

boys
shout
for
it
makes
you
jolly
and
free
the
ramrod
corps
people
who
have
seen
say
that
one
of
the
quaintest
spectacles
of
human
frailty
is
an
outbreak
of
hysterics
in
a
girls
school
it
starts
without
warning
generally
on
a
hot
afternoon
among
the
elder
pupils
a
girl
giggles
till
the
giggle
gets
beyond
control
then
she
throws
up
her
head
and
cries
honk
honk
honk
like
a
wild
goose
and
tears
mix
with
the
laughter
if
the
mistress
be
wise
she
will
rap
out
something
severe
at
this
point
and
check
matters
if
she
be
and
send
for
a
drink
of
water
the
chances
are
largely
in
favor
of
another
girl
laughing
at
the
afflicted
one
and
herself
collapsing
thus
the
trouble
spreads
and
may
end
in
half
of
what
answers
to
the
lower
sixth
of
a
boys
school
rocking
and
whooping
together
given
a
week
of
warm
weather
two
stately
promenades
per
diem
a
heavy
mutton
and
rice
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
certain
amount
of
nagging
from
the
teachers
and
a
few
other
things
some
amazing
effects
develop
at
least
this
is
what
folk
say
who
have
had
experience
now
the
mother
superior
of
a
convent
and
the
colonel
of
a
british
infantry
regiment
would
be
justly
shocked
at
any
comparison
being
made
between
their
respective
charges
but
it
is
a
fact
that
under
certain
circumstances
thomas
in
bulk
can
be
worked
up
into
ditthering
rippling
hysteria
he
does
not
weep
but
he
shows
his
trouble
unmistakably
and
the
consequences
get
into
the
newspapers
and
all
the
good
people
who
hardly
know
a
martini
from
a
snider
say
take
away
the
brute
s
ammunition
thomas
isn
t
a
brute
and
his
business
which
is
to
look
after
the
virtuous
people
demands
that
he
shall
have
his
ammunition
to
his
hand
he
doesn
t
wear
silk
stockings
and
he
really
ought
to
be
supplied
with
a
new
adjective
to
help
him
to
express
his
opinions
but
for
all
that
he
is
a
great
man
if
you
call
him
the
heroic
defender
of
the
national
honor
one
day
and
a
brutal
and
licentious
soldiery
the
next
you
naturally
bewilder
him
and
he
looks
upon
you
with
suspicion
there
is
nobody
to
speak
for
thomas
except
people
who
have
theories
to
work
off
on
him
and
nobody
understands
thomas
except
thomas
and
he
does
not
always
know
what
is
the
matter
with
himself
that
is
the
prologue
this
is
the
story
corporal
slane
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
miss
jhansi
m
kenna
whose
history
is
well
known
in
the
regiment
and
elsewhere
he
had
his
colonel
s
permission
and
being
popular
with
the
men
every
arrangement
had
been
made
to
give
the
wedding
what
private
ortheris
called
it
fell
in
the
heart
of
the
hot
weather
and
after
the
wedding
slane
was
going
up
to
the
hills
with
the
bride
none
the
less
slane
s
grievance
was
that
the
affair
would
be
only
a
wedding
and
he
felt
that
the
eeklar
of
that
was
meagre
miss
m
kenna
did
not
care
so
much
the
sergeant
s
wife
was
helping
her
to
make
her
and
she
was
very
busy
slane
was
just
then
the
only
moderately
contented
man
in
barracks
all
the
rest
were
more
or
less
miserable
and
they
had
so
much
to
make
them
happy
too
all
their
work
was
over
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
could
lie
on
their
backs
and
smoke
and
swear
at
the
they
enjoyed
a
fine
full
flesh
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
then
threw
themselves
down
on
their
cots
and
sweated
and
slept
till
it
was
cool
enough
to
go
out
with
their
towny
whose
vocabulary
contained
less
than
six
hundred
words
and
the
adjective
and
whose
views
on
every
conceivable
question
they
had
heard
many
times
before
there
was
the
canteen
of
course
and
there
was
the
temperance
room
with
the
papers
in
it
but
a
man
of
any
profession
can
not
read
for
eight
hours
a
day
in
a
temperature
of
degrees
or
degrees
in
the
shade
running
up
sometimes
to
degrees
at
midnight
very
few
men
even
though
they
get
a
pannikin
of
flat
stale
muddy
beer
and
hide
it
under
their
cots
can
continue
drinking
for
six
hours
a
day
one
man
tried
but
he
died
and
nearly
the
whole
regiment
went
to
his
funeral
because
it
gave
them
something
to
do
it
was
too
early
for
the
excitement
of
fever
or
cholera
the
men
could
only
wait
and
wait
and
wait
and
watch
the
shadow
of
the
barrack
creeping
across
the
blinding
white
dust
that
was
a
gay
life
they
lounged
about
was
too
hot
for
any
sort
of
game
and
almost
too
hot
for
fuddled
themselves
in
the
evening
and
filled
themselves
to
distension
with
the
healthy
nitrogenous
food
provided
for
them
and
the
more
they
stoked
the
less
exercise
they
took
and
more
explosive
they
grew
then
tempers
began
to
wear
away
and
men
fell
over
insults
real
or
imaginary
for
they
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
the
tone
of
the
repartees
changed
and
instead
of
saying
i
ll
knock
your
silly
face
in
men
grew
laboriously
polite
and
hinted
that
the
cantonments
were
not
big
enough
for
themselves
and
their
enemy
and
that
there
would
be
more
space
for
one
of
the
two
in
another
place
it
may
have
been
the
devil
who
arranged
the
thing
but
the
fact
of
the
case
is
that
losson
had
for
a
long
time
been
worrying
simmons
in
an
aimless
way
it
gave
him
occupation
the
two
had
their
cots
side
by
side
and
would
sometimes
spend
a
long
afternoon
swearing
at
each
other
but
simmons
was
afraid
of
losson
and
dared
not
challenge
him
to
a
fight
he
thought
over
the
words
in
the
hot
still
nights
and
half
the
hate
he
felt
toward
losson
be
vented
on
the
wretched
punkahcoolie
losson
bought
a
parrot
in
the
bazar
and
put
it
into
a
little
cage
and
lowered
the
cage
into
the
cool
darkness
of
a
well
and
sat
on
the
shouting
bad
language
down
to
the
parrot
he
taught
it
to
say
simmons
ye
which
means
swine
and
several
other
things
entirely
unfit
for
publication
he
was
a
big
gross
man
and
he
shook
like
a
jelly
when
the
parrot
had
the
sentence
correctly
simmons
however
shook
with
rage
for
all
the
room
were
laughing
at
him
the
parrot
was
such
a
disreputable
puff
of
green
feathers
and
it
looked
so
human
when
it
chattered
losson
used
to
sit
swinging
his
fat
legs
on
the
side
of
the
cot
and
ask
the
parrot
what
it
thought
of
simmons
the
parrot
would
answer
simmons
ye
good
boy
losson
used
to
say
scratching
the
parrot
s
head
ye
ear
that
sim
and
simmons
used
to
turn
over
on
his
stomach
and
make
answer
i
ear
take
eed
you
don
t
ear
something
one
of
these
in
the
restless
nights
after
he
had
been
asleep
all
day
fits
of
blind
rage
came
upon
simmonr
and
held
him
till
he
trembled
all
over
while
he
thought
in
how
many
different
ways
he
would
slay
losson
sometimes
he
would
picture
himself
trampling
the
life
out
of
the
man
with
heavy
and
at
others
smashing
in
his
face
with
the
butt
and
at
others
jumping
on
his
shoulders
and
dragging
the
head
back
till
the
neckbone
cracked
then
his
mouth
would
feel
hot
and
fevered
and
he
would
reach
out
for
another
sup
of
the
beer
in
the
pannikin
but
the
fancy
that
came
to
him
most
frequently
and
stayed
with
him
longest
was
one
connected
with
the
great
roll
of
fat
under
losson
s
right
ear
he
noticed
it
first
on
a
moonlight
night
and
thereafter
it
was
always
before
his
eyes
it
was
a
fascinating
roll
of
fat
a
man
could
get
his
hand
upon
it
and
tear
away
one
side
of
the
neck
or
he
could
place
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
on
it
and
blow
away
all
the
head
in
a
flash
losson
had
no
right
to
be
sleek
and
contented
and
when
he
simmons
was
the
butt
of
the
room
some
day
perhaps
he
would
show
those
who
laughed
at
the
simmons
ye
joke
that
he
was
as
good
as
the
rest
and
held
a
man
s
life
in
the
crook
of
his
forefinger
when
losson
snored
simmons
hated
him
more
bitterly
than
ever
why
should
losson
be
able
to
sleep
when
simmons
had
to
stay
awake
hour
after
hour
tossing
and
turning
on
the
tapes
with
the
dull
liver
pain
gnawing
into
his
right
side
and
his
head
throbbing
and
aching
after
canteen
he
thought
over
this
for
many
nights
and
the
world
became
unprofitable
to
him
he
even
blunted
his
naturally
fine
appetite
with
beer
and
tobacco
and
all
the
while
the
parrot
talked
at
and
made
a
mock
of
him
the
heat
continued
and
the
tempers
wore
away
more
quickly
than
before
a
sergeant
s
wife
died
of
heat
apoplexy
in
the
night
and
the
rumor
ran
abroad
that
it
was
cholera
men
rejoiced
openly
hoping
that
it
would
spread
and
send
them
into
camp
but
that
was
a
false
alarm
it
was
late
on
a
tuesday
evening
and
the
men
were
waiting
in
the
deep
double
verandas
for
last
posts
when
simmons
went
to
the
box
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
took
out
his
pipe
and
slammed
the
lid
down
with
a
bang
that
echoed
through
the
deserted
barrack
like
the
crack
of
a
rifle
ordinarily
speaking
the
men
would
have
taken
no
notice
but
their
nerves
were
fretted
to
they
jumped
up
and
three
or
four
clattered
into
the
only
to
find
simmons
kneeling
by
his
box
owl
it
s
you
is
it
they
said
and
laughed
foolishly
we
thought
twas
simmons
rose
slowly
if
the
accident
had
so
shaken
his
fellows
what
would
not
the
reality
do
you
thought
it
was
did
you
and
what
makes
you
think
he
said
lashing
himself
into
madness
as
he
went
on
to
hell
with
your
thinking
ye
dirty
simmons
ye
chuckled
the
parrot
in
the
veranda
sleepily
recognizing
a
voice
now
that
was
absolutely
all
the
tension
snapped
simmons
fell
back
on
the
deliberately
the
men
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
took
out
his
rifle
and
packet
of
ammunition
don
t
go
playing
the
goat
sim
said
losson
put
it
down
but
there
was
a
quaver
in
his
voice
another
man
stooped
slipped
his
boot
and
hurled
it
at
simmon
s
head
the
prompt
answer
was
a
shot
which
fired
at
random
found
its
billet
in
losson
s
throat
losson
fell
forward
without
a
word
and
the
others
scattered
you
thought
it
was
yelled
simmons
you
re
drivin
me
to
it
i
tell
you
you
re
drivin
me
to
it
get
up
losson
an
don
t
lie
shammin
an
your
blasted
parrit
that
druv
me
to
it
but
there
was
an
unaffected
reality
about
losson
s
pose
that
showed
simmons
what
he
had
done
the
men
were
still
clamoring
on
the
veranda
simmons
appropriated
two
more
packets
of
ammunition
and
ran
into
the
moonlight
muttering
i
ll
make
a
night
of
it
thirty
roun
s
an
the
last
for
myself
take
you
that
you
dogs
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
fired
into
the
brown
of
the
men
on
the
veranda
but
the
bullet
flew
high
and
landed
in
the
brickwork
with
a
vicious
phant
that
made
some
of
the
younger
ones
turn
pale
it
is
as
musketry
theorists
observe
one
thing
to
fire
and
another
to
be
fired
at
then
the
instinct
of
the
chase
flared
up
the
news
spread
from
barrack
to
barrack
and
the
men
doubled
out
intent
on
the
capture
of
simmons
the
wild
beast
who
was
heading
for
the
cavalry
stopping
now
and
again
to
send
back
a
shot
and
a
lurse
in
the
direction
of
his
pursuers
i
ll
learn

colonel
he

as

then
said
the
colonel
bitterly
if

his
chance
my

too
if

the
towheads
i
could
have
private
simmons

occupied
a
strong
position
near
a
well
on
the
edge
of
the
and
was
defying
the
regiment
to
come
on
the
regiment
was
not
anxious
to
comply
for
there
is
small
honor
in
being
shot
by
a
only
corporal
slane
rifle
in
band
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
wormed
his
way
toward

he
to
the
men
round
him
like
as
not
you

i

livin
simmons
ceased
shouting
for
a
while
and
the
noise
of
could
be
heard
across
the
plain
major
oldyne
commanding
the
horse
battery
was
coming
back
from
a
dinner
in
the
civil
lines
was
driving
after
his
usual
custom
that
is
to
say
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go

orf

a
blooming

i

an
all

well
but
jerry
blazes
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
passing
a
dangerous
murderer
he
was
as
his
adoring
battery
swore
long
and
fervently
without
knowledge
of
fear
and
they
were
surely
the
best
judges
for
jerry
blazes
it
was
notorious
had
done
his
possible
to
kill
a
man
each
time
the
battery
went
out
he
walked
toward
simmons
with
the
intention
of
rushing
him
and
knocking
him
down
don

make
me
do

said
simmons
i

got
nothing

ah

would
the
major
broke
into
a
run
take
that
then
the
major
dropped
with
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
and
simmons
stood
over
him
he
had
lost
the
satisfaction
of
killing
losson
in
the
desired
way
hut
here
was
a
helpless
body
to
his
hand

slip
in
another
cartridge
and
blow
off
the
head
or
with
the
butt
smash
in
the
white
face
he
stopped
to
consider
and
a
cry
went
up
from
the
far
side
of
the
he
s
killed
jerry
blazes
but
in
the
shelter
of
the
simmons
was
safe
except
when

out
of
the
shadow
of
a

into

at

in
the
dust
of

of

in

distance
shouted

slane
kicked
the
rifle
away
and
stood
up
in
the
peril
of
his
life
come
on
now
the
temptation
was
more
than
simmons
could
resist
for
the
corporal
in
his
white
clothes
offered
a
perfect
mark
don
t
misname
me
shouted
simmons
firing
as
he
spoke
the
shot
missed
and
the
shooter
blind
with
rage
threw
his
rifle
down
and
rushed
at
slane
from
the
protection
of
the
well
within
striking
distance
he
kicked
savagely
at
slane
s
stomach
but
the
weedy
corporal
knew
something
of
simmons
s
weakness
and
knew
too
the
deadly
guard
for
that
kick
bowing
forward
and
drawing
up
his
right
leg
till
the
heel
of
the
right
foot
was
set
some
three
inches
above
the
inside
of
the
left
he
met
the
blow
standing
on
one
leg
exactly
as
gonds
stand
when
they
meditate
and
ready
for
the
fall
that
would
follow
there
was
an
oath
the
corporal
fell
over
his
own
left
as
shinbone
met
shinbone
and
the
private
collapsed
his
right
leg
broken
an
inch
above
the
ankle
pity
you
don
t
know
that
guard
sim
said
slane
spitting
out
the
dust
as
he
rose
then

take

i

is
this
was
not
strictly
true
for
the
private

accomplished
his
own
downfall
since
it
is
the
special
merit
of
that
that
the
harder
the
kick
the
greater
the
kicker
s
discomfiture
slane
walked
to
jerry
blazes
and
hung
over
him
with
ostentatious
anxiety
while
simmons
weeping
with
pain
was
carried
away
ope
you
ain
t
urt
badly
sir
said
slane
the
major
had
fainted
and
there
was
an
ugly
ragged
hole
through
the
top
of
his
arm
slane
knelt
down
and
murmured
s
elp
me
i
believe
e
s
dead
well
if
that
ain
t
my
blooming
luck
all
over
but
the
major
was
destined
to
lead
his
battery
afield
for
many
a
long
day
with
unshaken
nerve
he
was
removed
and
nursed
and
petted
into
convalescence
while
the
battery
discussed
the
wisdom
of
capturing
simmons
and
blowing
him
from
a
gun
they
idolized
their
major
and
his
reappearance
on
parade
brought
about
a
scene
nowhere
provided
for
in
the
army
regulations
great
too
was
the
glory
that
fell
to
slane
s
share
the
gunners
would
have
made
him
drunk
thrice
a
day
for
at
least
a
fortnight
even
the
colonel
of
his
own
regiment
complimented
him
upon
his
coolness
and
the
local
paper
called
him
a
hero
these
things
did
not
puff
him
up
when
the
major
offered
him
money
and
thanks
the
virtuous
corporal
took
the
one
and
put
aside
the
other
but
he
had
a
request
to
make
and
prefaced
it
with
many
a
beg
y
pardon
could
the
major
see
his
way
to
letting
the
slane
m
kenna
wedding
be
adorned
by
the
presence
of
four
battery
horses
to
pull
a
hired
barouche
the
major
could
and
so
could
the
battery
excessively
so
it
was
a
gorgeous
wedding
wot
did
i
do
it
for
said
corporal
slane
for
the
orses
o
course
jhansi
ain
t
a
beauty
to
look
at
but
i
wasn
t
goin
to
ave
a
hired
jerry
blazes
if
i
adn
t
a
wanted
something
sim
might
ha
blowed
jerry
blazes
blooming
ead
into
hirish
stew
for
aught
i
d
a
and
they
hanged
private
him
as
high
as
haman
in
hollow
square
of
the
regiment
and
the
colonel
said
it
was
drink
and
the
chaplain
was
sure
it
was
the
devil
and
simmons
fancied
it
was
both
but
he
didn
t
know
and
only
hoped
his
fate
would
be
a
warning
to
his
companions
and
half
a
dozen
intelligent
publicists
wrote
six
beautiful
leading
articles
on
the
prevalence
of
crime
in
the
but
not
a
soul
thought
of
comparing
the
simmons
to
the
squawking
gaping
schoolgirl
with
which
this
story
opens
the
enlightenments
of
pagett
because
half
a
dozen
grasshoppers
under
a
fern
make
the
field
ring
with
their
importunate
chink
while
thousands
of
great
cattle
reposed
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
british
oak
chew
the
cud
and
are
silent
pray
do
not
imagine
that
those
who
make
the
noise
are
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
of
course
they
are
many
in
number
or
that
after
all
they
are
other
than
the
little
shrivelled
meagre
hopping
though
loud
and
troublesome
insects
of
the
burke
reflections
on
the
revolution
in
they
were
sitting
in
the
veranda
of
the
splendid
palace
of
an
indian
surrounded
by
all
the
glory
and
mystery
of
the
immemorial
east
in
plain
english
it
was
a
whitewashed
bungalow
set
in
a
dry
garden
of
dusty
tamarisk
trees
and
divided
from
the
road
by
a
low
mud
wall
the
green
parrots
screamed
overhead
as
they
flew
in
battalions
to
the
river
for
their
morning
drink
beyond
the
wall
clouds
of
fine
dust
showed
where
the
cattle
and
goats
of
the
city
were
passing
afield
to
graze
the
remorseless
white
light
of
the
winter
sunshine
of
northern
india
lay
upon
everything
and
improved
nothing
from
the
whining
by
the
court
to
the
long
perspective
of
level
road
and
the
blue
domed
tombs

just
visible
above
the
trees
a
happy
new
year
said
orde
to
his
guest
it
s
the
first
you
ve
ever
spent
out
of
england
isn
t
it
yes
happy
new
year
said
pagett
smiling
at
the
sunshine
what
a
divine
climate
you
have
here
just
think
of
the
brown
cold
fog
hanging
over
london
now
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
it
was
more
than
twenty
years
since
he
had
last
seen
orde
his
schoolmate
and
their
paths
in
the
world
had
divided
early
the
one
had
quitted
college
to
become
a
in
the
machinery
of
the
great
indian
government
the
other
more
blessed
with
goods
had
been
whirled
into
a
similar
position
in
the
english
scheme
three
successive
elections
had
not
affected
pagett
s
position
with
a
loyal
constituency
and
he
had
grown
insensibly
to
regard
himself
in
some
sort
as
a
pillar
of
the
empire
whose
real
worth
would
be
known
later
on
after
a
few
years
of
conscientious
attendance
at
many
divisions
after
newspaper
battles
innumerable
and
the
publication
of
interminable
correspondence
and
more
hasty
oratory
than
in
his
calmer
moments
he
cared
to
think
upon
it
occurred
to
him
as
it
had
occurred
to
many
of
his
fellows
in
parliament
that
a
tour
to
india
would
enable
him
to
sweep
a
larger
lyre
and
address
himself
to
the
problems
of
imperial
administration
with
a
firmer
hand
accepting
therefore
a
general
invitation
extended
to
him
by
orde
some
years
before
pagett
had
taken
ship
to
karachi
and
only
had
been
received
with
joy
by
the
of
amara
they
had
sat
late
discussing
the
changes
and
chances
of
twenty
years
recalling
the
names
of
the
dead
and
weighing
the
futures
of
the
living
as
is
the
custom
of
men
meeting
after
intervals
of
action
next
morning
they
smoked
the
after
breakfast
pipe
in
the
veranda
still
regarding
each
other
curiously
pagett
in
a
light
grey
and
garments
much
too
thin
for
the
time
of
the
year
and
a
puggried
carefully
and
wonderfully
made
orde
in
a
shooting
coat
riding
breeches
brown
cowhide
boots
with
spurs
and
a
battered
flax
helmet
he
had
ridden
some
miles
in
the
early
morning
to
inspect
a
doubtful
river
dam
the
men
s
faces
differed
as
much
as
their
attire
orde
s
worn
and
wrinkled
around
the
eyes
and
grizzled
at
the
temples
was
the
harder
and
more
square
of
the
two
and
it
was
with
something
like
envy
that
the
owner
looked
at
the
comfortable
outlines
of
pagett
s
blandly
receptive
countenance
the
clear
skin
the
untroubled
eye
and
the
mobile
lips
and
this
is
india
said
pagett
for
the
twentieth
time
staring
long
and
intently
at
the
grey
feathering
of
the
tamarisks
one
portion
of
india
only
it
s
very
much
like
this
for
miles
in
every
direction
by
the
way
now
that
you
have
rested
a
little
i
wouldn
t
ask
the
old
question
before
what
d
you
think
of
the
country
tis
the
most
pervasive
country
that
ever
yet
was
seen
i
acquired
several
pounds
of
your
country
coming
up
from
karachi
the
air
is
heavy
with
it
and
for
miles
and
miles
along
that
distressful
eternity
of
rail
there
s
no
horizon
to
show
where
air
and
earth
yes
it
isn
t
easy
to
see
truly
or
far
in
india
but
you
had
a
decent
passage
out
hadn
t
you
very
good
on
the
whole
your
may
be
unsympathetic
about
one
s
political
views
but
he
has
reduced
ship
life
to
a
the
is
a
political
orphan
and
if
he
s
wise
he
won
t
be
in
a
hurry
to
be
adopted
by
your
party
grandmothers
but
how
were
your
companions
unsympathetic
well
there
was
a
man
called
dawlishe
a
judge
somewhere
in
this
country
it
seems
and
a
capital
partner
at
whist
by
the
way
and
when
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
the
progress
of
india
in
a
political
sense
orde
hid
a
grin
which
might
or
might
not
have
been
sympathetic
the
national
congress
movement
and
other
things
in
which
as
a
member
of
parliament
i
m
of
course
interested
he
shifted
the
subject
and
when
i
once
cornered
him
he
looked
me
calmly
in
the
eye
and
said
that
s
all
tommy
rot
come
and
have
a
game
at
you
may
laugh
but
that
isn
t
the
way
to
treat
a
great
and
important
question
and
knowing
who
i
was
well
i
thought
it
rather
rude
don
t
you
know
and
yet
dawlishe
is
a
thoroughly
good
yes
he
s
a
friend
of
mine
and
one
of
the
straightest
men
i
know
i
suppose
like
many
he
felt
it
was
hopeless
to
give
you
any
just
idea
of
any
indian
question
without
the
documents
before
you
and
in
this
case
the
documents
you
want
are
the
country
and
the
precisely
that
was
why
i
came
straight
to
you
bringing
an
open
mind
to
bear
on
things
i
m
anxious
to
know
what
popular
feeling
in
india
is
really
like
y
know
now
that
it
has
wakened
into
political
life
the
national
congress
in
spite
of
dawlishe
must
have
caused
great
excitement
among
the
masses
on
the
contrary
nothing
could
be
more
tranquil
than
the
state
of
popular
feeling
and
as
to
excitement
the
people
would
as
soon
be
excited
over
the
rule
of
three
as
over
the
excuse
me
orde
but
do
you
think
you
are
a
fair
judge
isn
t
the
official
naturally
jealous
of
any
external
influences
that
might
move
the
masses
and
so
much
opposed
to
liberal
ideas
truly
liberal
ideas
that
he
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
regard
a
popular
movement
with
fairness
what
did
dawlishe
say
about
tommy
rot
think
a
moment
old
man
you
and
i
were
brought
up
together
taught
by
the
same
tutors
read
the
same
books
lived
the
same
life
and
new
languages
and
work
among
new
races
while
you
more
fortunate
remain
at
home
why
should
i
change
my
mind
our
i
change
my
sky
why
should
i
and
the
few
hundred
englishmen
in
my
service
become
unreasonable
prejudiced
fossils
while
you
and
your
newer
friends
alone
remain
bright
and
you
surely
don
t
fancy
civilians
are
members
of
a
primrose
league
of
course
not
but
the
mere
position
of
an
english
official
gives
him
a
point
of
view
which
can
not
but
bias
his
mind
on
this
pagett
moved
his
knee
up
and
down
a
little
uneasily
as
he
spoke
that
sounds
plausible
enough
but
like
more
plausible
notions
on
indian
matters
i
believe
it
s
a
mistake
you
ll
find
when
you
come
to
consult
the
unofficial
briton
that
our
fault
as
a
class
i
speak
of
the
civilian
rather
to
magnify
the
progress
that
has
been
made
toward
liberal
institutions
it
is
of
english
origin
such
as
it
is
and
the
stress
of
our
work
since
the
mutiny
only
thirty
years
ago
has
been
in
that
direction
no
i
think
you
will
get
no
fairer
or
more
dispassionate
view
of
the
congress
business
than
such
men
as
i
can
give
you
but
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
those
who
know
most
of
india
from
the
inside
are
inclined
to
wonder
at
the
noise
our
scarcely
begun
experiment
makes
in
but
surely
the
gathering
together
of
congress
delegates
is
of
itself
a
new
there
s
nothing
new
under
the
sun
when
europe
was
a
jungle
half
asia
flocked
to
the
canonical
conferences
of
buddhism
and
for
centuries
the
people
have
gathered
at
pun
hurdwar
trimbak
and
benares
in
immense
numbers
a
great
meeting
what
you
call
a
mass
meeting
is
really
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
popular
of
indian
institutions
in
the
case
of
the
congress
meetings
the
only
notable
fact
is
that
the
priests
of
the
altar
are
british
not
buddhist
jam
or
brahmanical
and
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
british
contrivance
kept
alive
by
the
efforts
of
hume
eardley
norton
and
you
mean
to
say
then
it
s
not
a
spontaneous
movement
what
movement
was
ever
spontaneous
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
this
seems
to
be
more
factitious
than
usual
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
it
try
it
by
the
touchstone
of
subscriptions
a
coarse
but
fairly
trustworthy
criterion
and
there
is
scarcely
the
color
of
money
in
it
the
delegates
write
from
england
that
they
are
out
of
pocket
for
working
expenses
railway
fares
and
stationery
the
mere
pasteboard
and
scaffolding
of
their
show
it
is
in
fact
collapsing
from
mere
financial
but
you
can
not
deny
that
the
people
of
india
who
are
perhaps
too
poor
to
subscribe
are
mentally
and
morally
moved
by
the
agitation
pagett
insisted
that
is
precisely
what
i
do
deny
the
native
side
of
the
movement
is
the
work
of
a
limited
class
a
microscopic
minority
as
lord
dufferin
described
it
when
compared
with
the
people
proper
but
still
a
very
interesting
class
seeing
that
it
is
of
our
own
creation
it
is
composed
almost
entirely
of
those
of
the
literary
or
clerkly
castes
who
have
received
an
english
surely
that
s
a
very
important
class
its
members
must
be
the
ordained
leaders
of
popular
anywhere
else
they
might
be
leaders
but
they
have
no
social
weight
in
this
land
and
though
they
have
been
employed
in
clerical
work
for
generations
they
have
no
practical
knowledge
of
affairs
a
ship
s
clerk
is
a
useful
person
but
he
is
scarcely
the
captain
and
an
writer
however
smart
he
may
be
is
not
the
colonel
you
see
the
writer
class
in
india
has
never
till
now
aspired
to
anything
like
command
it
wasn
t
allowed
to
the
indian
gentleman
for
thousands
of
years
past
has
resembled
victor
hugo
s
noble
un
vrai
sire
chatelain
laisse
ecrire
le
vilain
sa
main
digne
quand
il
signe
egratigne
le
velin
and
the
little
egralignures
he
most
likes
to
make
have
been
scored
pretty
deeply
by
the
but
this
is
childish
and
medheval
nonsense
precisely
and
from
your
or
rather
our
point
of
view
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
in
this
country
it
s
otherwise
the
fault
lies
in
our
indian
balances
not
yet
adjusted
to
civilized
weights
and
well
at
all
events
this
literary
class
represent
the
natural
aspirations
and
wishes
of
the
people
at
large
though
it
may
not
exactly
lead
them
and
in
spite
of
all
you
say
orde
i
defy
you
to
find
a
really
sound
english
radical
who
would
not
sympathize
with
those
pagett
spoke
with
some
warmth
and
he
had
scarcely
ceased
when
a
well
appointed
turned
into
the
compound
gates
and
orde
rose
saying
here
is
edwards
the
master
of
the
lodge
i
neglect
so
diligently
come
to
talk
about
accounts
i
as
the
vehicle
drove
up
under
the
porch
pagett
also
rose
saying
with
the
trained
effusion
born
of
much
practice
but
this
is
also
my
friend
my
old
and
valued
friend
edwards
i
m
delighted
to
see
you
i
knew
you
were
in
india
but
not
exactly
then
it
isn
t
accounts
edwards
said
orde
cheerily
why
no
sir
i
heard
pagett
was
coming
and
as
our
works
were
closed
for
the
new
year
i
thought
i
would
drive
over
and
see
a
very
happy
thought
edwards
you
may
not
know
orde
was
a
leading
member
of
our
radical
club
at
switebton
when
i
was
beginning
political
life
and
i
owe
much
to
his
exertions
there
s
no
pleasure
like
meeting
an
old
friend
except
perhaps
making
a
new
one
i
suppose
edwards
you
stick
to
the
good
old
cause
well
you
see
sir
things
are
different
out
here
there
s
precious
little
one
can
find
to
say
against
the
government
which
was
the
main
of
our
talk
at
home
and
them
that
do
say
things
are
not
the
sort
o
people
a
man
who
respects
himself
would
like
to
be
mixed
up
with
there
are
no
politics
in
a
manner
of
speaking
in
india
it
s
all
surely
you
are
mistaken
my
good
friend
why
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
england
just
to
see
the
working
of
this
great
national
i
don
t
know
where
you
re
going
to
find
the
nation
as
moves
to
begin
with
and
then
you
ll
be
hard
put
to
it
to
find
what
they
are
moving
about
it
s
like
this
sir
said
edwards
who
had
not
quite
relished
being
called
my
good
they
haven
t
got
any
grievance
nothing
to
hit
with
don
t
you
see
sir
and
then
there
s
not
much
to
hit
against
because
the
government
is
more
like
a
kind
of
general
providence
directing
an
old
established
state
of
things
than
that
at
home
where
there
s
something
new
thrown
down
for
us
to
fight
about
every
three
you
are
probably
in
your
workshops
full
of
english
mechanics
out
of
the
way
of
learning
what
the
masses
i
don
t
know
so
much
about
that
there
are
four
of
us
english
foremen
and
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
native
fitters
smiths
carpenters
painters
and
such
and
they
are
full
of
the
congress
of
course
never
hear
a
word
of
it
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
and
i
speak
the
talk
too
but
i
wanted
to
ask
how
things
are
going
on
at
home
old
tyler
and
brown
and
the
rest
we
will
speak
of
them
presently
but
your
account
of
the
indifference
of
your
men
surprises
me
almost
as
much
as
your
own
i
fear
you
are
a
backslider
from
the
good
old
doctrine
ed
pagett
spoke
as
one
who
mourned
the
death
of
a
near
relative
not
a
bit
sir
but
i
should
be
if
i
took
up
with
a
parcel
of
baboos
pleaders
and
schoolboys
as
never
did
a
day
s
work
in
their
lives
and
couldn
t
if
they
tried
and
if
you
was
to
poll
us
english
railway
men
mechanics
tradespeople
and
the
like
of
that
all
up
and
down
the
country
from
peshawur
to
calcutta
you
would
find
us
mostly
in
a
tale
together
and
yet
you
know
we
re
the
same
english
you
pay
some
respect
to
at
home
at
lection
time
and
we
have
the
pull
o
knowing
something
about
this
is
very
curious
but
you
will
let
me
come
and
see
you
and
perhaps
you
will
kindly
show
me
the
railway
works
and
we
will
talk
things
over
at
leisure
and
about
all
old
friends
and
old
times
added
pagett
detecting
with
quick
insight
a
look
of
disappointment
in
the
mechanic
s
face
nodding
briefly
to
orde
edwards
mounted
his
and
drove
off
it
s
very
disappointing
said
the
member
to
orde
who
while
his
friend
discoursed
with
edwards
had
been
looking
over
a
bundle
of
sketches
drawn
on
grey
paper
in
purple
ink
brought
to
him
by
a
chuprassee
don
t
let
it
trouble
you
old
chap
said
orde
sympathetically
look
here
a
moment
here
are
some
sketches
by
the
man
who
made
the
carved
wood
screen
you
admired
so
much
in
the
and
wanted
a
copy
of
and
the
artist
himself
is
here
a
native
said
pagett
of
course
was
the
reply
bishen
siagh
is
his
name
and
he
has
two
brothers
to
help
him
when
there
is
an
important
job
to
do
the
three
go
ato
partnership
but
they
spend
most
of
their
time
and
all
their
money
in
litigation
over
an
inheritance
and
i
m
afraid
they
are
getting
involved
thoroughbred
sikhs
of
the
old
rock
obstinate
touchy
bigoted
and
cunning
but
good
men
for
all
that
here
is
bishen
singn
shall
we
ask
him
about
the
congress
but
bishen
singh
who
approached
with
a
respectful
salaam
had
never
heard
of
it
and
he
listened
with
a
puzzled
face
and
obviously
feigned
interest
to
orde
s
account
of
its
aims
and
objects
finally
shaking
his
vast
white
turban
with
great
significance
when
he
learned
that
it
was
promoted
by
certain
pleaders
named
by
orde
and
by
educated
natives
he
began
with
labored
respect
to
explain
how
he
was
a
poor
man
with
no
concern
in
such
matters
which
were
all
under
the
control
of
god
but
presently
broke
out
of
urdu
into
familiar
punjabi
the
mere
sound
of
which
had
a
rustic
smack
of
village
and
as
he
denounced
the
wearers
of
white
coats
the
jugglers
with
words
who
filched
his
field
from
him
the
men
whose
backs
were
never
bowed
in
honest
work
and
poured
ironical
scorn
on
the
bengali
he
and
one
of
his
brothers
had
seen
calcutta
and
being
at
work
there
had
bengali
carpenters
given
to
them
as
assistants
those
carpenters
said
bishen
singh
black
apes
were
more
efficient
workmates
and
as
for
the
bengali
the
guttural
click
needed
no
interpretation
but
orde
translated
the
rest
while
pagett
gazed
with
terest
at
the
he
seems
to
have
a
most
illiberal
prejudice
against
the
bengali
said
the
yes
it
s
very
sad
that
for
ages
outside
bengal
there
should
be
so
bitter
a
prejudice
pride
of
race
which
also
means
is
the
plague
and
curse
of
india
and
it
spreads
far

with
his
to
the
large
map
of
india
on
the
veranda
wall
see
i
begin
with
the
north
said
he
there
s
the
afghan
and
as
a
highlander
he
despises
all
the
dwellers
in
the
exception
of
the
sikh
whom
he
hates
as
cordially
as
the
sikh
hates
him
the

and

and
the
rajput
that

a

a
strong
objection
to
put
it
mildly
to

poisonously

go

minute

are
all
at
one
on
that
point
i
m
giving
you
merely
the
roughest
possible
outlines
of
the
facts
of
bishen
singh
his
clean
cut
nostrils
still
quivering
watched
the
large
sweep
of
the
whip
as
it
traveled
from
the
frontier
through
sindh
the
punjab
and
rajputana
till
it
rested
by
the
valley
of
the
jumna
hate
eternal
and
inextinguishable
hate
concluded
orde
flicking
the
lash
of
the
whip
across
the
large
map
from
east
to
west
as
he
sat
down

canning
s
advice
to
lord
granville
never
write
or
speak
of
indian
things
without
looking
at
a
pagett
opened
his
eyes
orde
resumed
and
the
is
only
a
part
of
it
what
s
really
the
matter
with
bisben
singh
is
which
unfortunately
is
even
more
intense
and
more
widely
spread
that
s
one
of
the
little
drawbacks
of
caste
which
some
of
your
recent
english
writers
find
an
impeccable
the
was
glad
to
be
recalled
to
the
business
of
his
craft
and
his
eyes
shone
as
he
received
instructions
for
a
carved
wooden
doorway
for
pagett
which
he
promised
should
be
splendidly
executed
and
despatched
to
england
in
six
months
it
is
an
irrelevant
detail
but
in
spite
of
orde
s
reminders
fourteen
months
elapsed
before
the
work
was
finished
business
over
bishen
singh
hung
about
reluctant
to
take
his
leave
and
at
last
joining
his
hands
and
approaching
orde
with
bated
breath
and
whispering
humbleness
said
he
had
a
petition
to
make
orde
s
face
suddenly
lost
all
trace
of
expression
speak
on
bishen
singh
said
he
and
the
carver
in
a
whining
tone
explained
that
his
case
against
his
brothers
was
fixed
for
hearing
before
a
native
judge
and
here
he
dropped
his
voice
still
lower
till
he
was
summarily
stopped
by
orde
who
sternly
pointed
to
the
gate
with
an
emphatic
begone
bishen
singh
showing
but
little
sign
of
discomposure
salaamed
respectfully
to
the
friends
and
departed
pagett
looked
inquiry
orde
with
complete
recovery
of
his
usual
urbanity
replied
it
s
nothing
only
the
old
story
he
wants
his
case
to
be
tried
by
an
english
all
do
when
he
began
to
hint
that
the
other
side
were
in
improper
relations
with
the
native
judge
i
had
to
shut
him
up
gunga
ram
the
man
he
wanted
to
make
insinuations
about
may
not
be
very
bright
but
he
s
as
honest
as
on
the
bench
but
that
s
just
what
one
can
t
get
a
native
to
do
you
really
mean
to
say
these
people
prefer
to
have
their
cases
tried
by
english
judges
why
pagett
drew
a
long
breath
i
didn
t
know
that
at
this
point
a
phaeton
entered
the
compound
and
orde
rose
with
confound
it
there
s
old
rasul
ah
khan
come
to
pay
one
of
his
tiresome
duty
calls
i
m
afraid
we
shall
never
get
through
our
little
congress
pagett
was
an
almost
silent
spectator
of
the
grave
formalities
of
a
visit
paid
by
a
punctilious
old
mahommedan
gentleman
to
an
indian
official
and
was
much
impressed
by
the
distinction
of
manner
and
fine
appearance
of
the
mohammedan
landholder
when
the
exchange
of
polite
banalities
came
to
a
pause
he
expressed
a
wish
to
learn
the
courtly
visitor
s
opinion
of
the
national
congress
orde
reluctantly
interpreted
and
with
a
smile
which
even
mohammedan
politeness
could
not
save
from
bitter
scorn
rasul
ah
khan
intimated
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
cared
still
less
it
was
a
kind
of
talk
encouraged
by
the
government
for
some
mysterious
purpose
of
its
own
and
for
his
own
part
he
wondered
and
held
his
peace
pagett
was
far
from
satisfied
with
this
and
wished
to
have
the
old
gentleman
s
opinion
on
the
propriety
of
managing
all
indian
affairs
on
the
basis
of
an
elective
system
orde
did
his
best
to
explain
but
it
was
plain
the
visitor
was
bored
and
bewildered
frankly
he
didn
t
think
much
of
committees
they
had
a
municipal
committee
at
lahore
and
had
elected
a
menial
servant
an
orderly
as
a
member
he
had
been
informed
of
this
on
good
authority
and
after
that
committees
had
ceased
to
interest
him
but
all
was
according
to
the
rule
of
government
and
please
god
it
was
all
for
the
best
what
an
old
fossil
it
is
cried
pagett
as
orde
returned
from
seeing
his
guest
to
the
door
just
like
some
old
hidalgo
of
spain
what
does
he
really
think
of
the
congress
after
all
and
of
the
elective
system
hates
it
all
like
poison
when
you
are
sure
of
a
majority
election
is
a
fine
system
but
you
can
scarcely
expect
the
mahommedans
the
most
masterful
and
powerful
minority
in
the
country
to
contemplate
their
own
extinction
with
joy
the
worst
of
it
is
that
he
and
his
who
are
many
and
the
landed
proprietors
also
of
hindu
race
are
frightened
and
put
out
by
this
election
business
and
by
the
importance
we
have
bestowed
on
lawyers
pleaders
writers
and
the
like
who
have
up
to
now
been
in
abject
submission
to
them
they
say
little
hut
after
all
they
are
the
most
important
fagots
in
the
great
bundle
of
communities
and
all
the
glib
bunkum
in
the
world
would
not
pay
for
their
estrangement
they
have
controlled
the
but
i
am
assured
that
experience
of
local
in
your
municipalities
has
been
most
satisfactory
and
when
once
the
principle
is
accepted
in
your
centres
don
t
you
know
it
is
bound
to
spread
and
these
important
ah
m
people
of
yours
would
learn
it
like
the
rest
i
see
no
difficulty
at
all
and
the
smooth
lips
closed
with
the
complacent
snap
habitual
to
pagett
the
man
of
cheerful
yesterdays
and
confident
orde
looked
at
him
with
a
dreary
smile
the
privilege
of
election
has
been
most
reluctantly
withdrawn
from
scores
of
municipalities
others
have
had
to
be
summarily
suppressed
and
outside
the
presidency
towns
the
actual
work
done
has
been
badly
performed
this
is
of
less
moment
only
sends
up
the
local
the
fact
that
the
public
interest
in
municipal
elections
never
very
strong
has
waned
and
is
waning
in
spite
of
careful
nursing
on
the
part
of
government
can
you
explain
this
lack
of
interest
said
pagett
putting
aside
the
rest
of
orde
s
remarks
you
may
find
a
ward
of
the
key
in
the
fact
that
only
one
in
every
thousand
af
our
population
can
spell
then
they
are
infinitely
more
interested
in
religion
and
caste
questions
than
in
any
sort
of
politics
when
the
business
of
mere
existence
is
over
their
minds
are
occupied
by
a
series
of
interests
pleasures
rituals
superstitions
and
the
like
based
on
centuries
of
tradition
and
usage
you
perhaps
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
people
absolutely
devoid
of
curiosity
to
whom
the
book
the
daily
paper
and
the
printed
speech
are
unknown
and
you
would
describe
their
life
as
blank
that
s
a
profound
mistake
you
are
in
another
land
another
century
down
on
the
of
society
where
the
family
merely
and
not
the
community
is
the
average
oriental
can
not
be
brought
to
look
beyond
his
clan
his
life
too
is
naore
complete
and
and
less
sordid
and
than
you
might
imagine
it
is
bovine
and
slow
in
some
respects
but
it
is
never
empty
you
and
i
are
inclined
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
to
forget
that
it
is
the
man
that
is
elemental
not
the
book
the
corn
and
the
cattle
are
all
my
care
and
the
rest
is
the
will
of
why
should
such
folk
look
up
from
their
immemorially
appointed
round
of
duty
and
interests
to
meddle
with
the
unknown
and
fuss
with
how
would
you
atop
of
all
your
interests
care
to
conduct
even
of
your
life
according
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
papuans
let
s
say
that
s
what
it
comes
but
if
they
won
t
take
the
trouble
to
vote
why
do
you
anticipate
that
mohammedans
proprietors
and
the
rest
would
be
crushed
by
majorities
of
them
again
pagett
disregarded
the
closing
sentence
because
though
the
landholders
would
not
move
a
finger
on
any
purely
political
question
they
could
be
raised
in
dangerous
excitement
by
religious
hatreds
already
the
first
note
of
this
has
been
sounded
by
the
people
who
are
trying
to
get
up
an
agitation
on
the
question
and
every
year
there
is
trouble
over
the
mohammedan
muharrum
processions
but
who
looks
after
the
popular
rights
being
thus
unrepresented
the
government
of
her
majesty
the
queen
empress
of
india
in
which
if
the
congress
promoters
are
to
be
believed
the
people
have
an
implicit
trust
for
the
congress
circular
specially
prepared
for
rustic
comprehension
says
the
movement
is
for
the
remission
of
tax
the
advancement
of
hindustan
and
the
strengthening
of
the
british
this
paper
is
headed
in
large
letters
may
the
prosperity
of
the
empire
of
india
really
said
pagett
that
shows
some
cleverness
but
there
are
things
better
worth
imitation
in
our
english
methods
of
er
political
statement
than
this
sort
of
amiable
anyhow
resumed
orde
you
perceive
that
not
a
word
is
said
about
elections
and
the
elective
principle
and
the
reticence
of
the
congress
promoters
here
shows
they
are
wise
in
their
but
the
elective
principle
must
triumph
in
the
end
and
the
little
difficulties
you
seem
to
anticipate
would
give
way
on
the
introduction
of
a
scheme
capable
of
indefinite
but
is
it
possible
to
devise
a
scheme
which
always
assuming
that
the
people
took
any
interest
in
it
without
enormous
expense
ruinous
dislocation
of
the
administation
and
danger
to
the
public
peace
can
satisfy
the
aspirations
of
hume
and
his
following
and
yet
safeguard
the
interests
of
the
mahommedans
the
landed
and
wealthy
classes
the
conservative
hindus
the
eurasians
parsees
sikhs
rajputs
native
christians
domiciled
europeans
and
others
who
are
each
important
and
powerful
in
their
way
pagett
s
attention
however
was
diverted
to
the
gate
where
a
group
of
cultivators
stood
in
apparent
hesitation
here
are
the
twelve
apostles
by
jove
come
straight
out
of
raffaele
s
cartoons
said
the
with
the
fresh
appreciation
of
a
newcomer
orde
loth
to
be
interrupted
turned
impatiently
toward
the
villagers
and
their
leader
handing
his
long
staff
to
one
of
his
companions
advanced
to
the
house
it
is
old
jelbo
the
lumherdar
or
of
pind
sharkot
and
a
very
intelligent
man
for
a
the
jat
farmer
had
removed
his
shoes
and
stood
smiling
on
the
edge
of
the
veranda
his
strongly
marked
features
glowed
with
russet
bronze
and
his
bright
eyes
gleamed
under
deeply
set
brows
contracted
by
lifelong
exposure
to
sunshine
his
beard
and
moustache
streaked
with
grey
swept
from
bold
cliffs
of
brow
and
cheek
in
the
large
sweeps
one
sees
drawn
by
michael
angelo
and
strands
of
long
black
hair
mingled
with
the
irregularly
piled
wreaths
and
folds
of
his
turban
the
drapery
of
stout
blue
cotton
cloth
thrown
over
his
broad
shoulders
and
girt
round
his
narrow
loins
hung
from
his
tall
form
in
broadly
sculptured
folds
and
he
would
have
made
a
superb
model
for
an
artist
in
search
of
a
patriarch
orde
greeted
him
cordially
and
after
a
polite
pause
the
countryman
started
off
with
a
long
story
told
with
impressive
earnestness
orde
listened
and
smiled
interrupting
the
speaker
at
times
to
argue
and
reason
with
him
in
a
tone
which
pagett
could
hear
was
kindly
and
finally
checking
the
flux
of
words
was
about
to
dismiss
him
when
pagett
suggested
that
he
should
be
asked
about
the
national
congress
but
jelloc
had
never
heard
of
it
he
was
a
poor
man
and
such
things
by
the
favor
of
his
honor
did
not
concern
him
what
s
the
matter
with
your
big
friend
that
he
was
so
terribly
in
earnest
asked
pagett
when
he
had
left
nothing
much
he
wants
the
blood
of
the
people
in
the
next
village
who
have
had
smallpox
and
cattle
plague
pretty
badly
and
by
the
help
of
a
wizard
a
currier
and
several
pigs
have
passed
it
on
to
his
own
village
wants
to
know
if
they
can
t
be
run
in
for
this
awful
crime
it
seems
they
made
a
dreadful
charivari
at
the
village
boundary
threw
a
quantity
of
objects
over
the
border
a
buffalo
s
skull
and
other
things
then
branded
a
chamur
what
you
would
call
a
currier
on
his
hinder
parts
and
drove
him
and
a
number
of
pigs
over
into
jelbo
s
village
jelbo
says
he
can
bring
evidence
to
prove
that
the
wizard
directing
these
proceedings
who
is
a
sansi
has
been
guilty
of
theft
arson
perjury
and
murder
but
would
prefer
to
have
him
punished
for
bewitching
them
and
inflicting
and
how
on
earth
did
you
answer
such
a
lunatic
lunatic
i
the
old
fellow
is
as
sane
as
you
or
i
and
he
has
some
ground
of
complaint
against
those
sansis
i
asked
if
he
would
like
a
native
superintendent
of
police
with
some
men
to
make
inquiries
but
he
objected
on
the
grounds
the
police
were
rather
worse
than
smallpox
and
criminal
tribes
put
criminal
tribes
er
i
don
t
quite
understand
said
paget
we
have
in
india
many
tribes
of
people
who
in
the
slack
days
became
robbers
in
various
kind
and
preyed
on
the
people
they
are
being
restrained
and
reclaimed
little
by
little
and
in
time
will
become
useful
citizens
but
they
still
cherish
hereditary
traditions
of
crime
and
are
a
difficult
lot
to
deal
with
by
the
way
what
about
the
political
rights
of
these
folk
under
your
schemes
the
country
people
call
them
vermin
but
i
they
would
be
electors
with
the
nonsense
special
provision
would
be
made
for
them
in
a
electoral
scheme
and
they
would
doubtless
be
treated
with
fitting
severity
said
pagett
with
a
magisterial
air
severity
yes
but
whether
it
would
be
fitting
is
doubtful
even
those
poor
devils
have
rights
and
after
all
they
only
practice
what
they
have
been
but
criminals
orde
yes
criminals
with
codes
and
rituals
of
crime
gods
and
godlings
of
crime
and
a
hundred
songs
and
sayings
in
praise
of
it
puzzling
isn
t
it
it
s
simply
dreadful
they
ought
to
be
put
down
at
once
are
there
many
of
them
not
more
than
about
sixty
thousand
in
this
province
for
many
of
the
tribes
broadly
described
as
criminal
are
really
vagabond
and
criminal
only
on
occasion
while
others
are
being
settled
and
reclaimed
they
are
of
great
antiquity
a
legacy
from
the
past
the
golden
glorious
aryan
past
of
max
muller
birdwood
and
the
rest
of
your
spindrift
an
orderly
brought
a
card
to
orde
who
took
it
with
a
movement
of
irritation
at
the
interruption
and
banded
it
to
pagett
a
large
card
with
a
ruled
border
in
red
ink
and
in
the
centre
in
schoolboy
copper
plate
dma
nath
give
salaam
said
the
civilian
and
there
entered
in
haste
a
slender
youth
clad
in
a
closely
fitting
coat
of
grey
homespun
tight
trousers
shoes
and
a
small
black
velvet
cap
his
thin
cheek
twitched
and
his
eyes
wandered
restlessly
for
the
young
man
was
evidently
nervous
and
uncomfortable
though
striving
to
assume
a
free
and
easy
air
your
honor
may
perhaps
remember
me
he
said
in
english
and
orde
scanned
him
keenly
i
know
your
face
somehow
you
belonged
to
the
shershah
district
i
think
when
i
was
in
charge
there
yes
sir
my
father
is
writer
at
shershah
and
your
honor
gave
me
a
prize
when
i
was
first
in
the
middle
school
examination
five
years
ago
since
then
i
have
prosecuted
my
studies
and
i
am
now
second
year
s
student
in
the
mission
of
course
you
are
kedar
nath
s
son
the
boy
who
said
he
liked
geography
better
than
play
or
sugar
cakes
and
i
didn
t
believe
you
how
is
your
father
getting
on
he
is
well
and
he
sends
his
salaam
but
his
circumstances
are
depressed
and
he
also
is
down
on
his
you
learn
english
idiom
at
the
mission
college
it
yes
sir
they
are
the
best
idioms
and
my
father
ordered
me
to
ask
your
honor
to
say
a
word
for
him
to
the
present
incumbent
of
your
honor
s
shoes
the
latchet
of
which
he
is
not
worthy
to
open
and
who
knows
not
joseph
for
things
are
different
at
sher
shah
now
and
my
father
wants
your
father
is
a
good
man
and
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
at
this
point
a
telegram
was
handed
to
orde
who
after
glancing
at
it
said
he
must
leave
his
young
friend
whom
he
introduced
to
pagett
a
member
of
the
english
house
of
commons
who
wishes
to
learn
about
orde
bad
scarcely
retired
with
his
telegram
when
pagett
began
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
something
of
the
national
congress
movement
sir
it
is
the
greatest
movement
of
modern
times
and
one
in
which
all
educated
men
like
us
must
join
all
our
students
are
for
the
excepting
i
suppose
mahommedans
and
the
christians
said
pagett
quick
to
use
his
recent
instruction
these
are
some
mere
exceptions
to
the
universal
but
the
people
outside
the
college
the
working
classes
the
agriculturists
your
father
and
mother
for
my
mother
said
the
young
man
with
a
visible
effort
to
bring
himself
to
pronounce
the
word
has
no
ideas
and
my
father
is
not
agriculturist
nor
working
class
he
is
of
the
kayeth
caste
but
he
had
not
the
advantage
of
a
collegiate
education
and
he
does
not
know
much
of
the
congress
it
is
a
movement
for
the
educated
adjective
and
noun
in
a
sort
of
vocal
hyphen
ah
yes
said
pagett
feeling
he
was
a
little
off
the
rails
and
what
are
the
benefits
you
expect
to
gain
by
it
oh
sir
everything
england
owes
its
greatness
to
parliamentary
institutions
and
we
should
at
once
gain
the
same
high
position
in
scale
of
nations
sir
we
wish
to
have
the
sciences
the
arts
the
manufactures
the
industrial
factories
with
steam
engines
and
other
motive
powers
and
public
meetings
and
debates
already
we
have
a
debating
club
in
connection
with
the
college
and
elect
a
speaker
sir
the
progress
must
come
you
also
are
a
member
of
parliament
and
worship
the
great
lord
ripon
said
the
youth
breathlessly
and
his
black
eyes
flashed
as
he
finished
his
commaless
sentences
well
said
pagett
drily
it
has
not
yet
occurred
to
me
to
worship
his
lordship
although
i
believe
he
is
a
very
worthy
man
and
i
am
not
sure
that
england
owes
quite
all
the
things
you
name
to
the
house
of
commons
you
see
my
young
friend
the
growth
of
a
nation
like
ours
is
slow
subject
to
many
influences
and
if
you
have
read
your
history
aright
sir
i
know
it
all
all
norman
conquest
magna
charta
runnymede
reformation
tudors
stuarts
milton
and
burke
and
i
have
read
something
of
herbert
spencer
and
gibbon
s
decline
and
fall
reynolds
mysteries
of
the
court
and
pagett
felt
like
one
who
had
pulled
the
string
of
a
unawares
and
hastened
to
stop
the
torrent
with
a
question
as
to
what
particular
grievances
of
the
people
of
india
the
attention
of
an
elected
assembly
should
be
first
directed
but
young
dma
nath
was
slow
to
particularize
there
were
many
very
many
demanding
consideration
pagett
would
like
to
hear
of
one
or
two
typical
examples
the
repeal
of
the
arms
act
was
at
last
named
and
the
student
learned
for
the
first
time
that
a
license
was
necessary
before
an
englishman
could
carry
a
gun
in
england
then
natives
of
india
ought
to
be
allowed
to
become
volunteer
riflemen
if
they
chose
and
the
absolute
equality
of
the
oriental
with
his
european
in
civil
status
should
be
proclaimed
on
principle
and
the
indian
army
should
be
considerably
reduced
the
student
was
not
however
prepared
with
answers
to
pagett
s
mildest
questions
on
these
points
and
he
returned
to
vague
generalities
leaving
the
so
much
impressed
with
the
crudity
of
his
views
that
he
was
glad
on
orde
s
return
to
say
to
his
very
interesting
young
friend
what
do
you
think
of
young
india
asked
orde
curious
very
and
yet
the
civilian
replied
one
can
scarcely
help
sympathizing
with
him
for
his
mere
youth
s
sake
the
young
orators
of
the
oxford
union
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
and
showed
doubtless
just
the
same
enthusiasm
if
there
were
any
political
analogy
between
india
and
england
if
the
thousand
races
of
this
empire
were
one
if
there
were
any
chance
even
of
their
learning
to
speak
one
language
if
in
short
india
were
a
utopia
of
the
and
not
a
real
land
this
kind
of
talk
might
be
worth
listening
to
but
it
is
all
based
on
false
analogy
and
ignorance
of
the
but
he
is
a
native
and
knows
the
he
is
a
sort
of
english
schoolboy
but
married
three
years
and
the
father
of
two
weaklings
and
knows
less
than
most
english
schoolboys
you
saw
all
he
is
and
knows
and
such
ideas
as
he
has
acquired
are
directly
hostile
to
the
most
cherished
convictions
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
but
what
does
he
mean
by
saying
he
is
a
student
of
a
mission
college
is
he
a
christian
he
meant
just
what
he
said
and
he
is
not
a
christian
nor
ever
will
he
be
good
people
in
america
scotland
and
england
most
of
whom
would
never
dream
of
collegiate
education
for
their
own
sons
are
pinching
themselves
to
bestow
it
in
pure
waste
on
indian
youths
their
scheme
is
an
oblique
subterranean
attack
on
heathenism
the
theory
being
that
with
the
jam
of
secular
education
leading
to
a
university
degree
the
pill
of
moral
or
religious
instruction
may
he
coaxed
down
the
heathen
but
does
it
succeed
do
they
make
converts
they
make
no
converts
for
the
subtle
oriental
swallows
the
jam
and
rejects
the
pill
but
the
mere
example
of
the
sober
righteous
and
godly
lives
of
the
principals
and
professors
who
are
most
excellent
and
devoted
men
must
have
a
certain
moral
value
yet
as
lord
lansdowne
pointed
out
the
other
day
the
market
is
dangerously
overstocked
with
graduates
of
our
universities
who
look
for
employment
in
the
administration
an
immense
number
are
employed
but
year
by
year
the
college
mills
grind
out
increasing
lists
of
youths
foredoomed
to
failure
and
disappointment
and
meanwhile
trade
manufactures
and
the
industrial
arts
are
neglected
and
in
fact
regarded
with
contempt
by
our
new
literary
mandarins
in
but
our
young
friend
said
he
wanted
and
factories
said
pagett
yes
he
would
like
to
direct
such
concerns
he
wants
to
begin
at
the
top
for
manual
labor
is
held
to
be
discreditable
and
he
would
never
defile
his
hands
by
the
apprenticeship
which
the
architects
engineers
and
manufacturers
of
england
cheerfully
undergo
and
he
would
be
aghast
to
learn
that
the
leading
names
of
industrial
enterprise
in
england
belonged
a
generation
or
two
since
or
now
belong
to
men
who
wrought
with
their
own
hands
and
though
he
talks
glibly
of
manufacturers
he
refuses
to
see
that
the
indian
manufacturer
of
the
future
will
be
the
despised
workman
of
the
present
it
was
proposed
for
example
a
few
weeks
ago
that
a
certain
municipality
in
this
province
should
establish
an
elementary
technical
school
for
the
sons
of
workmen
the
stress
of
the
opposition
to
the
plan
came
from
a
pleader
who
owed
all
he
had
to
a
college
education
bestowed
on
him
gratis
by
government
and
missions
you
would
have
fancied
some
fine
old
crusted
tory
squire
of
the
last
generation
was
speaking
these
people
he
said
want
no
education
for
they
learn
their
trades
from
their
fathers
and
to
teach
a
workman
s
son
the
elements
of
mathematics
and
physical
science
would
give
him
ideas
above
his
business
they
must
be
kept
in
their
place
and
it
was
idle
to
imagine
that
there
was
any
science
in
wood
or
iron
and
he
carried
his
point
but
the
indian
workman
will
rise
in
the
social
scale
in
spite
of
the
new
literary
in
england
we
have
scarcely
begun
to
realize
that
there
is
an
industrial
class
in
this
country
yet
i
suppose
the
example
of
men
like
edwards
for
instance
must
tell
said
pagett
thoughtfully
that
you
shouldn
t
know
much
about
it
is
natural
enough
for
there
are
but
few
sources
of
information
india
in
this
as
in
other
respects
is
like
a
badly
kept
written
up
to
date
and
men
like
edwards
are
in
reality
missionaries
who
by
precept
and
example
are
teaching
more
lessons
than
they
know
only
a
few
however
of
their
crowds
of
subordinates
seem
to
care
to
try
to
emulate
them
and
aim
at
individual
advancement
the
rest
drop
into
the
ancient
indian
caste
how
do
you
mean
asked
he
well
it
is
found
that
the
new
railway
and
factory
workmen
the
fitter
the
smith
the
and
the
rest
are
already
forming
separate
hereditary
castes
you
may
notice
this
down
at
jamalpur
in
bengal
one
of
the
oldest
railway
centres
and
at
other
places
and
in
other
industries
they
are
following
the
same
inexorable
indian
which
means
queried
pagett
it
means
that
the
rooted
habit
of
the
people
is
to
gather
in
small
family
groups
with
no
thought
or
care
for
any
interests
but
their
habit
which
is
scarcely
compatible
with
the
right
acceptation
of
the
elective
yet
you
must
admit
orde
that
though
our
young
friend
was
not
able
to
expound
the
faith
that
is
in
him
your
indian
army
is
too
not
nearly
big
enough
for
its
main
purpose
and
as
a
side
issue
there
are
certain
powerful
minorities
of
fighting
folk
whose
interests
an
asiatic
government
is
bound
to
consider
arms
is
as
much
a
means
of
livelihood
as
civil
employ
under
government
and
law
and
it
would
be
a
heavy
strain
on
british
bayonets
to
hold
down
sikhs
jats
bilochis
rohillas
rajputs
bhils
dogras
pahtans
and
gurkbas
to
abide
by
the
decisions
of
a
numerical
majority
opposed
to
their
interests
leave
the
numerical
majority
to
itself
without
the
british
flock
of
sheep
might
as
reasonably
hope
to
manage
a
troop
of
this
complaint
about
excessive
growth
of
the
army
is
akin
to
another
contention
of
the
congress
party
they
protest
against
the
malversation
of
the
whole
of
the
moneys
raised
by
additional
taxes
as
a
famine
insurance
fund
to
other
purposes
you
must
be
aware
that
this
special
famine
fund
has
all
been
spent
on
frontier
roads
and
defences
and
strategic
railway
schemes
as
a
protection
against
but
there
was
never
a
special
famine
fund
raised
by
special
taxation
and
put
by
as
in
a
box
no
sane
administrator
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
in
a
time
of
prosperity
a
finance
minister
rejoicing
in
a
margin
proposed
to
annually
apply
a
million
and
a
half
to
the
construction
of
railways
and
canals
for
the
protection
of
districts
liable
to
scarcity
and
to
the
reduction
of
the
annual
loans
for
public
works
but
times
were
not
always
prosperous
and
the
finance
minister
had
to
choose
whether
he
would
bang
up
the
insurance
scheme
for
a
year
or
impose
fresh
taxation
when
a
farmer
hasn
t
got
the
little
surplus
he
hoped
to
have
for
buying
a
new
wagon
and
draining
a
field
corner
you
don
t
accuse
him
of
malversation
if
he
spends
what
he
has
on
the
necessary
work
of
the
rest
of
his
a
clatter
of
hoofs
was
heard
and
orde
looked
up
with
vexation
but
his
brow
cleared
as
a
horseman
halted
under
the
porch
hellin
orde
just
looked
in
to
ask
if
you
are
coming
to
polo
on
tuesday
we
want
you
badly
to
help
to
crumple
up
the
krab
bokbar
orde
explained
that
he
had
to
go
out
into
the
district
and
while
the
visitor
complained
that
though
good
men
wouldn
t
play
duffers
were
always
keen
and
that
his
side
would
probably
be
beaten
pagett
rose
to
look
at
his
mount
a
red
lathered
biloch
mare
with
a
curious
incurving
of
the
ears
quite
a
little
thoroughbred
in

to
his

yes
she

as
good
as
they

she
s
all

in

aren

mr

about

what

your

burke
turned
to
the
with
a
frank
smile
well
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
you
sir
i
should
say
damn
the
congress
but
then
i
m
no
politician
but
only
a
business
you
find
it
a
tiresome
subject
yes
it
s
all
that
and
worse
than
that
for
this
kind
of
agitation
is
anything
but
wholesome
for
the
how
do
you
mean
it
would
be
a
long
job
to
explain
and
sara
here
won
t
stand
but
you
know
how
sensitive
capital
is
and
how
timid
investors
are
all
this
sort
of
rot
is
likely
to
frighten
them
and
we
can
t
afford
to
frighten
them
the
passengers
aboard
an
ocean
steamer
don
t
feel
reassured
when
the
ship
s
way
is
stopped
and
they
hear
the
workmen
s
hammers
tinkering
at
the
engines
down
below
the
old

s
going
on
all
right
as
she
is
and
only
wants
quiet
and
room
to
move
them
s
my
sentiments
and
those
of
some
other
people
who
have
to
do
with
money
and
then
you
are
a
supporter
of
the
government
as
it
why
no
the
indian
government
is
much
too
timid
with
its
an
old
maiden
aunt
of

a
funk
about
her
investments
they
don

spend

enough
on
railways

instance
and
they
are
slow
in
a
general
way
and
ought
to
be
made
to
sit
up
in
all
that
concerns
the
encouragement
of
private
enterprise
and
coaxing
out
into
use
the
millions
of
capital
that
lie
dormant
in
the
the
mare
was
dancing
with
impatience
and
burke
was
evidently
anxious
to
be
off
so
the
men
wished
him
who
is
your
genial
friend
who
condemns
both
congress
and
government
in
a
breath
asked
pagett
with
an
amused
smile
just
now
he
is
reggie
burke
keener
on
polo
than
on
anything
else
but
if
you
go
to
the
sind
and
sialkote
bank
you
would
find
reginald
burke
a
very
capable
man
of
business
known
and
liked
by
an
immense
constituency
north
and
south
of
do
you
think
he
is
right
about
the
government
s
want
of
enterprise
i
should
hesitate
to
say
better
consult
the
merchants
and
chambers
of
commerce
in
cawnpore
madras
bombay
and
calcutta
but
though
these
bodies
would
like
as
reggie
puts
it
to
make
government
sit
up
it
is
an
elementary
consideration
in
governing
a
country
like
india
which
must
be
administered
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
at
large
that
the
counsels
of
those
who
resort
to
it
for
the
sake
of
making
money
should
be
judiciously
weighed
and
not
allowed
to
overpower
the
rest
they
are
welcome
guests
here
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
has
been
found
best
to
restrain
their
influence
thus
the
rights
of
plantation
laborers
factory
operatives
and
the
like
have
been
protected
and
the
capitalist
eager
to
get
on
has
not
always
regarded
government
action
with
favor
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
under
an
elective
system
the
commercial
communities
of
the
great
towns
might
find
means
to
secure
majorities
on
labor
questions
and
on
financial
they
would
act
at
least
with
intelligence
and
intelligence
yes
but
as
to
consideration
who
at
the
present
moment
most
bitterly
resents
the
tender
solicitude
of
lancashire
for
the
welfare
and
protection
of
the
indian
factory
operative
english
and
native
capitalists
running
cotton
mills
and
but
is
the
solicitude
of
lancashire
in
this
matter
entirely
disinterested
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
say
i
merely
indicate
an
example
of
how
a
powerful
commercial
interest
might
hamper
a
government
intent
in
the
first
place
on
the
larger
interests
of
orde
broke
off
to
listen
a
moment
there
s
lathrop
talking
to
my
wife
in
the
said
he
surely
not
that
s
a
lady
s
voice
and
if
my
ears
don
t
deceive
me
an
exactly
eva
mccreery
lathrop
chief
of
the
new
women
s
hospital
here
and
a
very
good
fellow
forbye
doctor
he
said
as
a
graceful
figure
came
out
on
the
veranda
you
seem
to
be
in
trouble
i
hope
orde
was
able
to
help
your
wife
is
real
kind
and
good
i
always
come
to
her
when
i
m
in
a
fix
but
i
fear
it
s
more
than
comforting
i
you
work
too
hard
and
wear
yourself
out
said
orde
kindly
let
me
introduce
my
friend
pagett
just
fresh
from
home
and
anxious
to
learn
his
india
you
could
tell
him
something
of
that
more
important
half
of
which
a
mere
man
knows
so
perhaps
i
could
if
i
d
any
heart
to
do
it
but
i
m
in
trouble
i
ve
lost
a
case
a
case
that
was
doing
well
through
nothing
in
the
world
but
inattention
on
the
part
of
a
nurse
i
had
begun
to
trust
and
when
i
spoke
only
a
small
piece
of
my
mind
she
collapsed
in
a
whining
heap
on
the
floor
it
is
the
men
were
silent
for
the
blue
eyes
of
the
lady
doctor
were
dim
recovering
herself
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
half
sad
half
humorous
and
i
am
in
a
whining
heap
too
but
what
phase
of
indian
life
are
you
particularly
interested
in
sir
mr
pagett
intends
to
study
the
political
aspect
of
things
and
the
possibility
of
bestowing
electoral
institutions
on
the
wouldn
t
it
be
as
much
to
the
purpose
to
bestow
collars
on
them
they
need
many
things
more
urgently
than
votes
why
it
s
like
giving
a
for
a
broken
don
t
quite
follow
said
pagett
uneasily
well
what
s
the
matter
with
this
country
is
not
in
the
least
political
but
an
all
round
entanglement
of
physical
social
and
moral
evils
and
corruptions
all
more
or
less
due
to
the
unnatural
treatment
of
women
you
can
t
gather
figs
from
thistles
and
so
long
as
the
system
of
infant
marriage
the
prohibition
of
the
remarriage
of
widows
the
lifelong
imprisonment
of
wives
and
mothers
in
a
worse
than
penal
confinement
and
the
withholding
from
them
of
any
kind
of
education
or
treatment
as
rational
beings
continues
the
country
can
t
advance
a
step
half
of
it
is
morally
dead
and
worse
than
dead
and
that
s
just
the
half
from
which
we
have
a
right
to
look
for
the
best
impulses
it
s
right
here
where
the
trouble
is
and
not
in
any
political
considerations
but
do
they
marry
so
early
said
pagett
vaguely
the
average
age
is
seven
but
thousands
are
married
still
earlier
one
result
is
that
girls
of
twelve
and
thirteen
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
wifehood
and
motherhood
and
as
might
be
expected
the
rate
of
mortality
both
for
mothers
and
children
is
terrible
pauperism
domestic
unhappiness
and
a
low
state
of
health
are
only
a
few
of
the
consequences
of
this
then
when
as
frequently
happens
the
dies
prematurely
his
widow
is
condemned
to
worse
than
death
she
may
not
must
live
a
secluded
and
despised
life
a
life
so
unnatural
that
she
sometimes
prefers
suicide
more
often
she
goes
astray
you
don
t
know
in
england
what
such
words
as
and
mean
but
they
mean
unspeakable
horrors
well
but
the
advanced
political
party
here
will
surely
make
it
their
business
to
advocate
social
reforms
as
well
as
political
ones
said
pagett
very
surely
they
will
do
no
such
thing
said
the
lady
doctor
emphatically
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
why
even
of
the
funds
devoted
to
the
marchioness
of
dufferin
s
organization
for
medical
aid
to
the
women
of
india
it
was
said
in
print
and
in
speech
that
they
would
be
better
spent
on
more
college
scholarships
for
men
and
in
all
the
advanced
parties
forgive
them
and
in
all
their
programmes
they
carefully
avoid
all
such
subjects
they
will
talk
about
the
protection
of
the
cow
for
that
s
an
ancient
superstition
they
can
all
understand
that
but
the
protection
of
the
women
is
a
new
and
dangerous
she
turned
to
pagett
impulsively
you
are
a
member
of
the
english
parliament
can
you
do
nothing
the
foundations
of
their
life
are
and
bestially
rotten
i
could
tell
your
wife
things
that
i
couldn
t
tell
you
i
know
the
life
the
inner
life
that
belongs
to
the
native
and
i
know
nothing
else
and
believe
me
you
might
as
well
try
to
grow
in
a
as
to
make
anything
of
a
people
that
are
born
and
reared
as
these
these
things
re
the
men
talk
of
their
rights
and
privileges
i
have
seen
the
women
that
bear
these
very
men
and
god
forgive
the
men
pagett
s
eyes
opened
with
a
large
wonder
lathrop
rose
tempestuously
i
must
be
off
to
lecture
said
she
and
i
m
sorry
that
i
can
t
show
you
my
hospitals
but
you
had
better
believe
sir
that
it
s
more
necessary
for
india
than
all
the
elections
in
that
s
a
woman
with
a
mission
and
no
mistake
said
pagett
after
a
pause
yes
she
believes
in
her
work
and
so
do
i
said
orde
i
ve
a
notion
that
in
the
end
it
will
be
found
that
the
most
helpful
work
done
for
india
in
this
generation
was
wrought
by
lady
dufferin
in
drawing
work
that
was
by
the
way
even
with
her
husband
s
great
name
to
back
it
to
the
needs
of
women
here
in
effect
native
habits
and
beliefs
are
an
organized
conspiracy
against
the
laws
of
health
and
happy
life
but
there
is
some
dawning
of
hope
how
d
you
account
for
the
general
indifference
then
i
suppose
it
s
due
in
part
to
their
fatalism
and
their
utter
indifference
to
all
human
suffering
how
much
do
you
imagine
the
great
province
of
the
with
over
twenty
million
people
and
half
a
score
rich
towns
has
contributed
to
the
maintenance
of
civil
dispensaries
last
year
about
seven
thousand
that
s
seven
hundred
pounds
said
pagett
quickly
i
wish
it
was
replied
orde
but
anyway
it
s
an
absurdly
inadequate
sum
and
shows
one
of
the
blank
sides
of
oriental
pagett
was
silent
for
a
long
time
the
question
of
direct
and
personal
pain
did
not
lie
within
his
researches
he
preferred
to
discuss
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
and
contented
himself
with
murmuring
they
ll
do
better
later
then
with
a
rush
returning
to
his
first
thought
but
my
dear
orde
if
it
s
merely
a
class
movement
of
a
local
and
temporary
character
how
d
you
account
for
bradlaugh
who
is
at
least
a
man
of
sense
taking
it
up
i
know
nothing
of
the
champion
of
the
new
brahmins
but
what
i
see
in
the
papers
i
suppose
there
is
something
tempting
in
being
hailed
by
a
large
assemblage
as
the
representative
of
the
aspirations
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
people
such
a
man
looks
through
all
the
roaring
and
the
wreaths
and
does
not
reflect
that
it
is
a
false
perspective
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
hides
the
real
complex
and
manifold
india
from
his
gaze
he
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
distinguish
between
the
ambitions
of
a
new
oligarchy
and
the
real
wants
of
the
people
of
whom
he
knows
nothing
but
it
s
strange
that
a
professed
radical
should
come
to
be
the
chosen
advocate
of
a
movement
which
has
for
its
aim
the
revival
of
an
ancient
tyranny
shows
how
even
radicalism
can
fall
into
academic
grooves
and
miss
the
essential
truths
of
its
own
creed
believe
me
pagett
to
deal
with
india
you
want
knowledge
and
experience
i
wish
he
would
come
and
live
here
for
a
couple
of
years
or
is
not
this
rather
an
ad
hominem
style
of
argument
can
t
help
it
in
a
case
like
this
indeed
i
am
not
sure
you
ought
not
to
go
further
and
weigh
the
whole
character
and
quality
and
upbringing
of
the
man
you
must
admit
that
the
monumental
complacency
with
which
he
trotted
out
his
ingenious
little
constitution
for
india
showed
a
strange
want
of
imagination
and
the
sense
of
no
i
don
t
quite
admit
it
said
pagett
well
you
know
him
and
i
don
t
but
that
s
how
it
strikes
a
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
paced
the
veranda
thoughtfully
and
after
all
the
burden
of
the
actual
daily
unromantic
toil
falls
on
the
shoulders
of
the
men
out
here
and
not
on
his
own
he
enjoys
all
the
privileges
of
recommendation
without
responsibility
and
perhaps
when
you
ve
seen
a
little
more
of
india
you
ll
understand
to
begin
with
our
death
rate
s
five
times
higher
than
speak
now
for
the
brutal
bureaucrat
and
we
work
on
the
refuse
of
cities
and
exhausted
civilizations
among
the
bones
of
the
pagett
laughed
that
s
an
epigrammatic
way
of
putting
it
is
it
let
s
see
said
the
deputy
commissioner
of
amara
striding
into
the
sunshine
toward
a
gardener
potting
roses
he
took
the
man
s
hoe
and
went
to
a
bank
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
come
here
pagett
he
said
and
cut
at
the
soil
after
three
strokes
there
rolled
from
under
the
blade
of
the
hoe
the
half
of
a
clanking
skeleton
that
settled
at
pagett
s
feet
in
an
unseemly
jumble
of
bones
the
drew
back
our
houses
are
built
on
cemeteries
said
orde
there
are
scores
of
thousands
of
graves
within
ten
pagett
was
contemplating
the
skull
with
the
awed
fascination
of
a
man
who
has
but
little
to
do
with
the
dead
india
s
a
very
curious
place
said
he
after
a
pause
ah
you

know
all
about
it
in

months
