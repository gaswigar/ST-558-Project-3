to

my
own

my
first
night

once
more

at

a
terrible
interview
conclusion
miss
blake
from
memory
if
ever
a
residence
suitable
in
every
respect
for
a
family
of
position
haunted
a
lawyer
offices
the
uninhabited
house
about
which
i
have
a
story
to
tell
haunted
those
of
craven
and
son
no
buckingham
street
strand
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
whether
it
happened
to
be
let
or
unlet
in
either
case
it
never
allowed
craven
or
his
clerks
of
whom
i
was
one
to
forget
its
existence
when
let
we
were
in
perpetual
hot
water
with
the
tenant
when
unlet
we
had
to
endeavour
to
find
some
tenant
to
take
that
unlucky
house
happy
were
we
when
we
could
get
an
agreement
signed
for
a
couple
of
years
although
we
always
had
misgivings
that
the
war
waged
with
the
last
occupant
would
probably
have
to
be
renewed
with
his
successor
still
when
we
were
able
to
let
the
desirable
residence
to
a
solvent
individual
even
for
twelve
months
craven
rejoiced
he
knew
how
to
proceed
with
the
tenants
who
came
blustering
or
threatening
or
complaining
or
bemoaning
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
miss
blake
and
her
letters
when
no
person
was
liable
for
the
rent
all
lawyers
i
am
one
myself
and
can
speak
from
a
long
and
varied
experience
all
lawyers
even
the
very
hardest
have
one
client
at
all
events
towards
whom
they
exhibit
much
forbearance
for
whom
they
feel
a
certain
sympathy
and
in
whose
interests
they
take
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
for
very
little
pecuniary
profit
a
client
of
this
kind
favours
me
with
his
business
he
has
favoured
me
with
it
for
many
years
past
each
first
of
january
i
register
a
vow
he
shall
cost
me
no
more
time
or
money
on
each
last
day
of
december
i
find
he
is
deeper
in
my
debt
than
he
was
on
the
same
date
a
twelvemonth
previous
i
often
wonder
how
this
is
why
we
so
fierce
to
one
human
being
possibly
honest
and
enough
should
be
as
wax
in
the
hand
of
the
moulder
when
another
individual
perhaps
utterly
disreputable
refuses
to
take
no
for
an
answer
do
we
purchase
our
indulgences
in
this
way
do
we
square
our
accounts
with
our
own
consciences
by
remembering
that
if
we
have
been
as
stone
to
dick
tom
and
harry
we
have
melted
at
the
first
appeal
of
jack
my
principal
craven
than
whom
a
better
man
never
breathed
had
an
unprofitable
client
for
whom
he
entertained
feelings
of
the
profoundest
pity
whom
he
treated
with
a
rare
courtesy
that
lady
was
miss
blake
and
when
the
old
house
on
the
thames
stood
tenantless
craven
bed
did
not
prove
one
of
roses
in
our
firm
there
was
no
son
craven
had
been
the
son
but
the
old
father
was
dead
and
our
chief
wife
had
brought
him
only
daughters
still
the
title
of
the
firm
remained
the
same
and
craven
own
signature
also
he
had
been
junior
for
such
a
number
of
years
that
when
death
sent
a
royal
invitation
to
his
senior
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
old
form
that
he
and
all
in
his
employment
tacitly
agreed
it
was
only
fitting
he
should
remain
junior
to
the
end
a
good
man
i
of
all
human
beings
have
reason
to
speak
well
of
him
even
putting
the
undoubted
fact
of
all
lawyers
keeping
one
unprofitable
client
into
the
scales
if
he
had
not
been
very
good
he
must
have
washed
his
hands
of
miss
blake
and
her
niece
house
long
before
the
period
at
which
this
story
opens
the
house
did
not
belong
to
miss
blake
it
was
the
property
of
her
niece
a
certain
miss
helena
elmsdale
of
whom
craven
always
spoke
as
that
poor
child
she
was
not
of
age
and
miss
blake
managed
her
few
pecuniary
affairs
besides
the
desirable
residence
suitable
etcetera
aunt
and
niece
had
property
producing
about
pounds
a
year
when
we
could
let
the
desirable
residence
handsomely
furnished
and
with
every
convenience
that
could
be
named
in
the
space
of
a
advertisement
to
a
family
from
the
country
or
an
officer
just
returned
from
india
or
to
an
invalid
who
desired
a
beautiful
and
quiet
abode
within
an
easy
drive
of
the
west
end
when
we
could
do
this
i
say
the
income
of
aunt
and
niece
rose
to
two
hundred
and
pounds
a
year
which
made
a
very
material
difference
to
miss
blake
when
we
could
not
let
the
house
or
when
the
payment
of
the
rent
was
in
dispute
craven
advanced
the
lady
various
five
and
ten
pound
notes
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
were
entered
duly
to
his
credit
in
the
eternal
books
in
the
mundane
records
kept
in
our
offices
they
always
appeared
as
debits
to
william
craven
private
account
as
for
the
young
men
about
our
establishment
of
whom
i
was
one
we
anathematised
that
house
i
do
not
intend
to
reproduce
the
language
we
used
concerning
it
at
one
period
of
our
experience
because
eventually
the
evil
wore
itself
out
as
most
evils
do
and
at
last
we
came
to
look
upon
the
desirable
residence
as
an
institution
of
our
firm
as
a
sort
of
with
which
it
was
creditable
to
be
associated
as
a
species
of
remarkable
criminal
always
on
its
trial
and
always
certain
to
be
defended
by
craven
and
son
in
fact
the
uninhabited
house
for
uninhabited
it
usually
was
whether
anyone
was
answerable
for
the
rent
or
not
finally
became
an
object
of
as
keen
interest
to
all
craven
clerks
as
it
became
a
source
of
annoyance
to
him
so
the
beam
goes
up
and
down
while
craven
the
complaints
of
tenants
and
laughed
at
the
idea
of
a
man
being
afraid
of
a
ghost
we
did
not
laugh
but
swore
when
however
craven
began
to
look
serious
about
the
matter
and
hoped
some
persons
were
not
trying
to
keep
the
place
tenantless
our
interest
in
the
old
house
became
absorbing
and
as
our
interest
in
the
residence
grew
so
likewise
did
our
appreciation
of
miss
blake
we
missed
her
when
she
went
abroad
which
she
always
did
the
day
a
fresh
agreement
was
signed
and
we
welcomed
her
return
to
england
and
our
offices
with
effusion
safely
i
can
say
no
millionaire
ever
received
such
an
ovation
as
fell
to
the
lot
of
miss
blake
when
after
a
foreign
tour
she
returned
to
those
lodgings
near
brunswick
square
which
her
residence
ought
i
think
to
have
rendered
classic
she
never
lost
an
hour
in
coming
to
us
with
the
dust
of
travel
upon
her
with
the
heat
and
burden
of
quarrels
with
railway
porters
and
encounters
with
cabmen
visible
to
anyone
who
chose
to
read
the
signs
of
the
times
miss
blake
came
pounding
up
our
stairs
wanting
to
see
craven
if
that
gentleman
was
engaged
she
would
sit
down
in
the
general
office
and
relate
her
latest
grievance
to
a
posse
of
sympathising
clerks
and
he
says
he
wo
pay
the
rent
was
always
the
refrain
of
these
lamentations
it
is
in
ireland
he
thinks
he
is
poor
soul
she
was
wont
to
declare
we
teach
him
different
miss
blake
the
spokesman
of
the
party
would
declare
whilst
another
ostentatiously
mended
a
pen
and
a
third
brought
down
a
ream
of
foolscap
and
laid
it
with
a
thump
before
him
on
the
desk
and
indeed
you
all
decent
lads
though
full
of
your
tricks
miss
blake
would
sometimes
remark
in
a
tone
of
gentle
reproof
but
if
you
had
a
niece
just
dying
with
grief
and
a
house
nobody
will
live
in
on
your
hands
you
would
not
have
as
much
heart
for
fun
i
can
tell
you
that
hearing
which
the
young
rascals
tried
to
look
sorrowful
and
failed
in
the
way
of
my
profession
i
have
met
with
many
singular
persons
but
i
can
safely
declare
i
never
met
with
any
person
so
singular
as
miss
blake
she
was
i
speak
of
her
in
the
past
tense
not
because
she
is
dead
but
because
times
and
circumstances
have
changed
since
the
period
when
we
both
had
to
do
with
the
uninhabited
house
and
she
has
altered
in
consequence
one
of
the
most
original
people
who
ever
crossed
my
path
born
in
the
north
of
ireland
the
child
of
a
mother
and
a
connaught
father
she
had
ingeniously
contrived
to
combine
in
her
own
person
the
vices
of
two
distinct
races
and
exclude
the
virtues
of
both
her
accent
was
the
most
fearful
which
could
be
imagined
she
had
the
brogue
of
the
west
grafted
on
the
accent
of
the
north
and
yet
there
was
a
variety
about
her
even
in
this
respect
one
never
could
tell
from
visit
to
visit
whether
she
proposed
to
pronounce
written
as
wrutten
or
wretten
footnote
the
wife
of
a
celebrated
indian
officer
stated
that
she
once
in
the
north
of
ireland
heard
utterance
thus
rendered
oh
that
my
words
were
that
they
were
in
a
whether
she
would
elect
to
style
her
parents
to
whom
she
made
frequent
reference
her
pawpaw
and
mawmaw
or
her
pepai
and
memai
it
all
depended
with
whom
miss
blake
had
lately
been
most
intimate
if
she
had
been
hand
and
glove
with
a
nob
from
her
own
country
she
was
in
no
way
reticent
about
thus
styling
her
grander
acquaintances
only
she
wrote
the
word
knob
who
thought
to
conceal
his
nationality
by
awing
and
hawing
she
spoke
about
people
being
morried
and
wearing
sockcloth
and
oshes
if
on
the
contrary
she
had
been
thrown
into
the
society
of
a
lady
who
so
far
honoured
england
as
to
talk
as
some
people
do
in
england
we
had
every
a
turned
into
e
and
every
u
into
o
while
she
minced
her
words
as
if
she
had
been
saying
niminy
piminy
since
she
first
began
to
talk
and
honestly
believed
no
human
being
could
ever
have
told
she
had
been
born
west
of
george
channel
but
not
merely
in
accent
did
miss
blake
evidence
the
fact
that
her
birth
had
been
the
result
of
an
injudicious
cross
the
more
one
knew
of
her
the
more
clearly
one
saw
the
wrong
points
she
threw
out
extravagant
to
a
fault
like
her
connaught
father
she
was
in
no
respect
generous
either
from
impulse
or
calculation
mean
about
minor
details
a
turn
of
character
probably
inherited
from
the
ulster
mother
she
was
utterly
destitute
of
that
careful
and
honest
economy
which
is
an
admirable
trait
in
the
natives
of
the
north
of
ireland
and
which
enables
them
so
frequently
after
being
strictly
just
to
be
much
more
than
liberal
honest
miss
blake
was
not
or
for
that
matter
honourable
either
her
indebtedness
to
our
firm
could
not
be
considered
other
than
a
matter
of
honour
and
yet
she
never
dreamt
of
paying
her
debt
to
craven
indeed
to
do
miss
blake
strict
justice
she
never
thought
of
paying
the
debts
she
owed
to
anyone
unless
she
was
obliged
to
do
so
nowadays
i
fear
it
would
fare
hard
with
her
were
she
to
try
her
old
tactics
with
the
british
tradesman
but
in
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
societies
were
not
and
then
the
british
tradesman
had
no
objection
i
fancy
to
be
gulled
perhaps
like
the
lawyer
and
the
unprofitable
client
he
being
gulled
on
one
side
his
ledger
against
being
fleeced
on
the
other
be
this
as
it
may
we
were
always
compounding
some
liability
for
miss
blake
as
well
as
letting
her
house
and
fighting
with
the
tenants
at
first
as
i
have
said
we
found
miss
blake
an
awful
bore
but
we
generally
ended
by
deciding
we
could
better
spare
a
better
man
indeed
the
months
when
she
did
not
come
to
our
office
seemed
to
want
flavour
of
gratitude
popularly
supposed
to
be
essentially
characteristic
of
the
irish
miss
blake
was
utterly
destitute
i
never
did
know
i
have
never
known
since
so
ungrateful
a
woman
not
merely
did
she
take
everything
craven
did
for
her
as
a
right
but
she
absolutely
turned
the
tables
and
brought
him
in
her
debtor
once
only
once
that
i
can
remember
he
ventured
to
ask
when
it
would
be
convenient
for
her
to
repay
some
of
the
money
he
had
from
time
to
time
advanced
miss
blake
was
taken
by
surprise
but
she
rose
equal
to
the
occasion
you
are
joking
craven
she
said
you
mean
when
will
i
want
to
ask
you
to
give
me
a
share
of
the
profits
you
have
made
out
of
the
estate
of
my
poor
sister
husband
why
that
house
has
been
as
good
as
an
annuity
to
you
for
six
long
years
it
has
stood
empty
or
next
to
empty
and
never
been
out
of
law
all
the
time
but
you
know
miss
blake
that
not
a
shilling
of
profit
has
accrued
to
me
from
the
house
being
in
law
he
pleaded
i
have
always
been
too
glad
to
get
the
rent
for
you
to
insist
upon
my
costs
and
really
now
do
not
try
to
impose
upon
me
she
interrupted
because
it
is
of
no
use
did
you
make
thousands
of
the
dead
man
and
now
have
you
got
the
house
why
if
you
never
had
a
penny
of
costs
instead
of
all
you
have
pocketed
that
house
and
the
name
it
has
brought
to
you
and
the
fame
which
has
spread
abroad
in
consequence
ca
be
reckoned
as
less
than
hundreds
a
year
to
your
firm
and
yet
you
ask
me
for
the
return
of
a
trumpery
four
or
five
sovereigns
i
am
ashamed
of
you
but
i
wo
imitate
your
bad
example
let
me
have
five
more
and
you
can
stop
ten
out
of
the
colonel
first
payment
i
am
very
sorry
said
my
employer
but
i
really
have
not
five
pounds
to
spare
hear
him
remarked
miss
blake
turning
towards
me
young
man
miss
blake
steadily
refused
to
recognise
the
possibility
of
any
clerk
being
even
by
accident
a
gentleman
will
you
hand
me
over
the
newspaper
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
she
wanted
with
the
newspaper
and
neither
had
craven
till
she
sat
down
again
deliberately
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
having
taken
place
after
she
rose
preparatory
to
saying
farewell
opened
the
sheet
out
to
its
full
width
and
commenced
to
read
the
debates
my
dear
miss
blake
began
craven
after
a
minute
pause
you
know
my
time
when
it
is
mine
is
always
at
your
disposal
but
at
the
present
moment
several
clients
are
waiting
to
see
me
and
let
them
wait
said
miss
blake
as
he
hesitated
a
little
your
time
and
their
time
is
no
more
valuable
than
mine
and
i
mean
to
stay
emphasising
the
word
till
you
let
me
have
that
five
pounds
why
look
now
that
house
is
taken
on
a
two
years
agreement
and
you
wo
see
me
again
for
that
time
likely
as
not
never
for
who
can
tell
what
may
happen
to
anybody
in
foreign
parts
only
one
charge
i
lay
upon
you
craven
do
let
me
be
buried
in
a
strange
country
it
is
bad
enough
to
be
so
far
as
this
from
my
father
and
my
mother
remains
but
i
daresay
i
manage
to
rest
in
the
same
grave
as
my
sister
though
robert
elmsdale
lies
between
he
separated
us
in
life
not
that
she
ever
cared
for
him
but
it
wo
matter
much
when
we
are
all
bones
and
dust
together
if
i
let
you
have
that
five
pounds
here
broke
in
craven
do
i
clearly
understand
that
i
am
to
recoup
myself
out
of
colonel
first
payment
i
said
so
as
plain
as
i
could
speak
agreed
miss
blake
and
her
speech
was
very
plain
indeed
craven
lifted
his
eyebrows
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
while
he
drew
his
towards
him
how
is
helena
he
asked
as
he
wrote
the
final
legendary
flourish
after
craven
and
son
helena
is
but
middling
poor
dear
answered
miss
blake
on
that
occasion
she
called
her
niece
hallana
she
frets
the
creature
as
is
natural
but
she
will
get
better
when
we
leave
england
england
is
a
hard
country
for
anyone
who
is
all
nairves
like
halana
why
do
you
never
bring
her
to
see
me
asked
craven
folding
up
the
cheque
bring
her
to
be
stared
at
by
a
parcel
of
clerks
exclaimed
miss
blake
in
a
tone
which
really
caused
my
hair
to
bristle
decent
young
fellows
in
their
own
rank
no
doubt
but
not
fit
to
look
at
my
sister
child
now
now
craven
ought
kathleen
blake
or
rather
kathleen
elmsdale
daughter
to
serve
as
a
fifth
of
november
guy
for
london
lads
you
know
she
is
handsome
enough
to
be
a
duchess
like
her
mother
yes
yes
i
know
agreed
craven
and
handed
over
the
cheque
after
i
had
held
the
door
open
for
miss
blake
to
pass
out
and
closed
it
securely
and
resumed
my
seat
miss
blake
turned
the
handle
and
treated
us
to
another
sight
of
her
bonnet
william
craven
for
two
years
at
any
rate
and
if
i
never
see
you
again
god
bless
you
for
you
been
a
true
friend
to
me
and
that
poor
child
who
has
nobody
else
to
look
to
and
then
before
craven
could
cross
the
room
she
was
gone
i
wonder
said
i
if
it
will
be
two
years
before
we
see
her
again
no
nor
the
fourth
of
two
years
answered
my
employer
there
is
something
queer
about
that
house
you
do
think
it
is
haunted
sir
do
you
i
ventured
of
course
not
said
craven
irritably
but
i
do
think
some
one
wants
to
keep
the
place
vacant
and
is
succeeding
admirably
the
question
i
next
put
seemed
irrelevant
but
really
resulted
from
a
long
train
of
thought
this
was
it
is
miss
elmsdale
very
handsome
sir
she
is
very
beautiful
was
the
answer
but
not
so
beautiful
as
her
mother
was
ah
me
two
old
old
stories
in
a
sentence
he
had
loved
the
mother
and
he
did
not
love
the
daughter
he
had
seen
the
mother
in
his
bright
hopeful
youth
and
there
was
no
light
of
morning
left
for
him
in
which
he
could
behold
the
child
to
other
eyes
she
might
in
her
bright
seem
lovely
as
an
angel
from
heaven
but
to
him
no
more
such
visions
were
to
be
vouchsafed
if
beauty
really
went
on
decaying
as
the
ancients
say
by
this
time
there
could
be
no
beauty
left
but
oh
greybeard
the
beauty
remains
though
our
eyes
may
be
too
dim
to
see
it
the
beauty
the
grace
the
rippling
laughter
and
the
saucy
smiles
which
once
had
power
to
stir
to
their
very
depths
our
hearts
friend
our
hearts
yours
and
mine
comrade
feeble
and
cold
and
pulseless
now
the
coroner
inquest
the
story
was
told
to
me
afterwards
but
i
may
as
well
weave
it
in
with
mine
at
this
juncture
from
the
maternal
ancestress
the
demoiselles
blake
inherited
a
certain
amount
of
money
it
was
through
no
fault
of
the
paternal
blake
through
no
want
of
endeavours
on
his
part
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
all
fortune
which
came
in
his
way
that
their
small
inheritance
remained
intact
but
the
fortune
was
so
willed
that
neither
the
girls
nor
he
could
divert
the
peaceful
tenure
of
its
dividends
the
mother
died
first
and
the
father
followed
her
ere
long
and
then
the
young
ladies
found
themselves
orphans
and
the
possessors
of
a
fixed
income
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
a
year
a
modest
income
and
yet
as
i
have
been
given
to
understand
they
might
have
married
well
for
the
money
in
those
days
particularly
in
ireland
men
went
very
cheap
and
the
misses
blake
one
and
both
could
before
they
left
off
mourning
have
wedded
respectively
a
curate
a
doctor
a
constabulary
officer
and
the
captain
of
a
government
schooner
the
misses
blake
looked
higher
however
and
came
to
england
where
rich
husbands
are
presumably
procurable
came
but
missed
their
market
miss
kathleen
found
only
one
lover
william
craven
whose
honest
affection
she
flouted
and
miss
susannah
found
no
lover
at
all
miss
kathleen
wanted
a
duke
or
an
earl
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
being
about
that
time
unprocurable
and
an
attorney
to
her
irish
ideas
seemed
a
very
poor
sort
of
substitute
for
which
reason
she
rejected
the
attorney
with
scorn
and
remained
single
the
while
dukes
and
earls
were
marrying
and
intermarrying
with
their
peers
or
their
inferiors
then
suddenly
there
came
a
frightful
day
when
kathleen
and
susannah
learned
they
were
penniless
when
they
understood
their
trustee
had
robbed
them
as
he
had
robbed
others
and
had
been
paying
their
interest
out
of
what
was
left
of
their
principal
they
tried
teaching
but
they
really
had
nothing
to
teach
they
tried
letting
lodgings
even
lodgers
rebelled
against
their
untidiness
and
want
of
punctuality
the
eldest
was
very
energetic
and
very
determined
and
the
youngest
very
pretty
and
very
conciliatory
nevertheless
business
is
business
and
lodgings
are
lodgings
and
the
misses
blake
were
on
the
verge
of
beggary
when
elmsdale
proposed
for
miss
kathleen
and
was
accepted
craven
by
that
time
a
family
man
gave
the
bride
away
and
secured
elmsdale
business
possibly
had
elmsdale
marriage
proved
happy
craven
might
have
soon
lost
sight
of
his
former
love
in
matrimony
as
in
other
matters
we
are
rarely
so
sympathetic
with
fulfilment
as
with
disappointment
the
pretty
miss
blake
was
a
disappointed
woman
after
she
had
secured
elmsdale
she
then
understood
that
the
best
life
could
offer
her
was
something
very
different
indeed
from
the
ideal
duke
her
beauty
should
have
won
and
she
did
not
take
much
trouble
to
conceal
her
dissatisfaction
with
the
arrangements
of
providence
craven
seeing
what
elmsdale
was
towards
men
pitied
her
perhaps
had
he
seen
what
elmsdale
was
towards
her
husband
he
might
have
pitied
him
but
then
he
did
not
see
for
women
are
wonderful
dissemblers
there
was
elmsdale
bluff
in
manner
short
in
person
red
in
the
face
cumbersome
in
figure
addicted
to
naughty
words
not
nice
about
driving
fearfully
hard
bargains
a
man
whom
men
hated
not
undeservedly
and
yet
nevertheless
a
man
capable
of
loving
a
woman
with
all
the
veins
of
his
heart
and
who
might
had
any
woman
been
found
to
love
him
have
compassed
earthly
salvation
there
were
those
who
said
he
never
could
compass
eternal
but
they
chanced
to
be
his
debtors
and
after
all
that
question
lay
between
himself
and
god
the
other
lay
between
himself
and
his
wife
and
it
must
be
confessed
except
so
far
as
his
passionate
disinterested
love
for
an
utterly
selfish
woman
tended
to
redeem
and
humanise
his
nature
she
never
helped
him
one
step
along
the
better
path
but
then
the
world
could
not
know
this
and
craven
of
whom
i
am
speaking
at
the
moment
was
likely
naturally
to
think
elmsdale
all
in
the
wrong
on
the
one
hand
he
saw
the
man
as
he
appeared
to
men
on
the
other
he
saw
the
woman
as
she
appeared
to
men
beautiful
to
the
last
fragile
with
the
low
voice
so
beautiful
in
any
woman
so
more
especially
beautiful
in
an
irish
woman
with
a
languid
face
which
insured
compassion
while
never
asking
for
it
with
the
appearance
of
a
martyr
and
the
tone
and
the
manner
of
a
suffering
saint
everyone
who
beheld
the
pair
together
remarked
what
a
pity
it
was
such
a
sweet
creature
should
be
married
to
such
a
bear
but
elmsdale
was
no
bear
to
his
wife
he
adored
her
the
selfishness
the
discontent
the
as
much
the
consequence
of
a
peevish
petted
temper
as
of
disease
which
might
well
have
exhausted
the
patience
and
tired
out
the
love
of
a
different
man
only
endeared
her
the
more
to
him
she
made
him
feel
how
inferior
he
was
to
her
in
all
respects
how
tremendously
she
had
condescended
when
she
agreed
to
become
his
wife
and
he
quietly
accepted
her
estimation
of
him
and
said
with
a
humility
which
was
touching
from
its
simplicity
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
kathleen
but
i
do
my
best
to
make
you
happy
for
her
sake
not
being
a
liberal
man
he
spent
money
freely
for
her
sake
he
endured
miss
blake
for
her
sake
he
bought
the
place
which
afterwards
caused
us
so
much
trouble
for
her
sake
he
who
had
always
scoffed
at
the
folly
of
people
turning
their
houses
into
stores
for
useless
timber
as
he
styled
the
upholsterer
greatest
triumphs
furnished
his
rooms
with
a
lavish
disregard
of
cost
for
her
sake
he
who
hated
society
smiled
on
visitors
and
entertained
the
guests
she
invited
with
no
grudging
hospitality
for
her
sake
he
dressed
well
and
did
many
other
things
which
were
equally
antagonistic
to
his
original
nature
and
he
might
just
as
well
have
gone
his
own
way
and
pleased
himself
only
for
all
the
pleasure
he
gave
her
or
all
the
thanks
she
gave
him
if
elmsdale
had
come
home
drunk
five
evenings
a
week
and
beaten
his
wife
and
denied
her
the
necessaries
of
life
and
kept
her
purse
in
a
chronic
state
of
emptiness
she
might
very
possibly
have
been
extremely
grateful
for
an
occasional
kind
word
or
smile
but
as
matters
stood
elmsdale
was
not
in
the
least
grateful
for
a
devotion
as
beautiful
as
it
was
extraordinary
and
posed
herself
on
the
domestic
sofa
in
the
character
of
a
martyr
most
people
accepted
the
representation
as
true
and
pitied
her
miss
blake
blissfully
forgetful
of
that
state
of
impecuniosity
from
which
elmsdale
proposal
had
extricated
herself
and
her
sister
never
wearied
of
stating
that
katty
had
thrown
herself
away
and
that
elmsdale
was
not
fit
to
tie
her
she
generously
admitted
the
poor
creature
did
his
best
but
according
to
blake
the
poor
creature
best
was
very
bad
indeed
it
not
his
fault
but
his
misfortune
the
lady
was
wont
to
remark
that
he
like
dirt
beside
her
he
ca
help
his
birth
and
his
and
his
disreputable
trade
or
business
or
whatever
he
likes
to
call
it
he
ca
help
never
having
had
a
father
nor
mother
to
speak
of
and
not
a
lady
or
gentleman
belonging
to
the
family
since
it
came
into
existence
i
not
blaming
him
but
it
is
hard
for
kathleen
and
she
reared
as
she
was
and
accustomed
to
the
best
society
in
ireland
which
is
very
different
let
me
tell
you
from
the
best
anybody
ever
saw
in
england
there
were
some
who
thought
if
elmsdale
could
tolerate
her
sister
company
she
might
without
difficulty
have
condoned
her
husband
want
of
acquaintance
with
some
points
of
grammar
and
etiquette
and
who
said
amongst
themselves
that
whereas
he
only
maltreated
miss
blake
mangled
every
letter
in
the
alphabet
but
these
carping
critics
were
in
the
minority
elmsdale
was
a
beauty
and
a
martyr
elmsdale
a
rough
beast
who
had
no
capacity
of
ever
developing
into
a
prince
miss
blake
was
a
model
of
sisterly
affection
and
if
eccentric
in
her
manner
and
bewildering
in
the
vagaries
of
her
accent
well
most
irish
people
the
highest
in
rank
not
excepted
were
the
same
why
there
was
lord
who
stated
at
a
public
meeting
that
roight
and
moight
were
not
always
convartible
tarms
and
accepted
the
cheers
and
laughter
which
greeted
his
utterance
as
evidence
that
he
had
said
something
rather
neat
miss
blake
accent
was
a
very
different
affair
indeed
from
those
wrestles
with
his
foe
in
which
her
always
came
off
worsted
he
endured
agonies
in
trying
to
call
himself
elmsdale
and
rarely
succeeded
in
styling
his
wife
anything
except
mrs
he
i
am
told
miss
blake
mimicry
of
this
peculiarity
was
delicious
but
i
never
was
privileged
to
hear
her
delineation
for
long
before
the
period
when
this
story
opens
elmsdale
had
departed
to
that
land
where
no
confusion
of
tongues
can
much
signify
and
where
helmsdale
no
doubt
served
his
purpose
just
as
well
as
miss
blake
more
refined
pronunciation
of
his
name
further
miss
helena
elmsdale
would
not
allow
a
word
in
depreciation
of
her
father
to
be
uttered
when
she
was
near
and
as
miss
helena
could
on
occasion
develop
a
very
pretty
little
temper
as
well
as
considerable
power
of
satire
miss
blake
dropped
out
of
the
habit
of
ridiculing
elmsdale
sins
of
omission
and
commission
and
contented
herself
by
generally
asserting
that
as
his
manner
of
living
had
broken
her
poor
sister
heart
so
his
manner
of
dying
had
broken
her
miss
blake
heart
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
the
orphan
child
i
am
able
to
hold
up
at
all
she
would
tell
us
i
would
not
have
blamed
him
so
much
for
leaving
us
poor
but
it
was
hard
and
cruel
to
leave
us
disgraced
into
the
bargain
and
then
miss
blake
would
weep
and
the
wag
of
the
office
would
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
ostentatiously
wipe
his
eyes
she
often
threatened
to
complain
of
that
boy
a
merry
mischievous
young
imp
to
craven
but
she
never
did
so
perhaps
because
the
clerks
always
gave
her
rapt
attention
and
an
interested
audience
was
very
pleasant
to
miss
blake
considering
the
nature
of
elmsdale
profession
miss
blake
had
possibly
some
reason
to
complain
of
the
extremely
unprofitable
manner
in
which
he
cut
up
he
was
what
the
lady
described
as
a
dirty
heaven
only
knows
how
he
drifted
into
his
occupation
few
men
i
imagine
select
such
a
trade
though
it
is
one
which
seems
to
exercise
an
enormous
fascination
for
those
who
have
adopted
it
the
only
son
of
a
very
small
builder
who
managed
to
leave
a
few
hundred
pounds
behind
him
for
the
benefit
of
elmsdale
then
clerk
in
a
contractor
office
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
anxieties
connected
with
his
father
business
to
wash
his
hands
of
bricks
and
mortar
experience
perhaps
had
taught
him
also
that
people
who
advanced
money
to
builders
made
a
very
nice
little
income
out
of
the
capital
so
employed
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
some
of
his
acquaintances
always
in
want
of
ready
cash
as
speculative
folks
usually
are
offered
such
terms
for
temporary
accommodation
as
tempted
him
to
enter
into
the
business
of
which
miss
blake
spoke
so
contemptuously
be
this
as
it
may
one
thing
is
certain
by
the
time
elmsdale
was
thirty
he
had
established
a
very
nice
little
connection
amongst
needy
men
whole
streets
were
mortgaged
to
him
terraces
nominally
the
property
of
some
builder
were
virtually
his
since
he
only
waited
the
builder
inevitable
bankruptcy
to
enter
into
possession
he
was
not
a
sixty
per
cent
man
always
requiring
some
very
much
better
security
than
a
name
before
parting
with
his
money
but
still
even
twenty
per
cent
usually
means
ruin
and
as
a
matter
of
course
most
of
elmsdale
clients
reached
that
pleasant
goal
they
could
have
managed
to
do
so
no
doubt
had
elmsdale
never
existed
but
as
he
was
in
existence
he
served
the
purpose
for
which
it
seemed
his
mother
had
borne
him
and
sooner
or
later
as
a
rule
sooner
than
later
assumed
the
shape
of
nemesis
to
most
of
those
who
did
business
with
him
there
were
exceptions
of
course
some
men
by
the
help
of
exceptional
good
fortune
roguery
or
genius
managed
to
get
out
of
hands
by
other
paths
than
those
leading
through
basinghall
or
portugal
streets
but
they
merely
proved
the
rule
notably
amongst
these
fortunate
persons
may
be
mentioned
a
harrison
and
a
harringford
and
as
elmsdale
called
them
when
he
did
not
refer
to
them
as
the
two
haitches
of
these
the
after
a
few
transactions
shook
the
dust
of
elmsdale
office
off
his
shoes
sent
him
the
money
he
owed
by
his
lawyer
and
ever
after
referred
to
elmsdale
as
that
thief
that
scoundrel
that
swindling
old
vagabond
and
so
forth
but
then
hard
words
break
no
bones
and
harrison
was
not
very
well
thought
of
himself
his
remarks
therefore
did
elmsdale
very
little
harm
a
is
not
usually
spoken
of
in
much
pleasanter
terms
by
those
who
once
have
been
thankful
enough
for
his
cheque
and
the
world
in
general
does
not
attach
a
vast
amount
of
importance
to
the
opinions
of
a
former
borrower
harrison
did
not
therefore
hurt
or
benefit
his
quondam
friend
to
any
appreciable
extent
but
with
harringford
the
case
was
different
he
and
elmsdale
had
been
doing
business
together
for
years
everything
he
possessed
in
the
world
he
stated
to
an
admiring
coroner
jury
summoned
to
sit
on
elmsdale
body
and
inquire
into
the
cause
of
that
gentleman
death
everything
he
possessed
in
the
world
he
owed
to
the
deceased
some
people
spoke
hardly
of
him
but
his
experience
of
elmsdale
enabled
him
to
say
that
a
juster
honester
or
man
never
existed
he
charged
high
interest
certainly
and
he
expected
to
be
paid
his
rate
but
then
there
was
no
deception
about
the
matter
if
it
was
worth
a
borrower
while
to
take
money
at
twenty
per
cent
why
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
business
men
are
not
children
remarked
harringford
and
ought
not
to
borrow
money
at
twenty
per
cent
unless
they
can
make
thirty
per
cent
out
of
it
personally
he
had
never
paid
elmsdale
more
than
twelve
and
a
half
or
fifteen
per
cent
but
then
their
transactions
were
on
a
large
scale
only
the
day
before
elmsdale
death
he
hesitated
a
little
over
that
word
and
became
as
the
reporters
said
affected
he
had
paid
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
the
deceased
told
him
he
had
urgent
need
of
the
money
and
at
considerable
inconvenience
he
raised
the
amount
if
the
question
were
pressed
as
to
whether
he
guessed
for
what
purpose
that
sum
was
so
urgently
needed
he
would
answer
it
of
course
but
he
suggested
that
it
should
not
be
pressed
as
likely
to
give
pain
to
those
who
were
already
in
terrible
affliction
hearing
which
the
jury
pricked
up
their
ears
and
the
curiosity
became
so
intense
that
he
experienced
some
difficulty
in
saying
calmly
that
as
the
object
of
his
sitting
there
was
to
elicit
the
truth
however
much
he
should
regret
causing
distress
to
anyone
he
must
request
that
harringford
whose
scruples
did
him
honour
would
keep
back
no
fact
tending
to
throw
light
upon
so
sad
an
affair
having
no
alternative
after
this
but
to
unburden
himself
of
his
secret
harringford
stated
that
he
feared
the
deceased
had
been
a
heavy
loser
at
ascot
harringford
having
gone
to
that
place
with
some
friends
met
elmsdale
on
the
expressing
astonishment
at
meeting
him
there
elmsdale
stated
he
had
run
down
to
look
after
a
client
of
his
who
he
feared
was
going
wrong
he
said
he
did
not
much
care
to
do
business
with
a
betting
man
in
the
course
of
subsequent
conversation
however
he
told
the
witness
he
had
some
money
on
the
favourite
as
frequently
proves
the
case
the
favourite
failed
to
come
in
first
that
was
all
harringford
knew
about
the
matter
elmsdale
never
mentioned
how
much
he
had
lost
in
fact
he
never
referred
again
except
in
general
terms
to
their
meeting
he
stated
however
that
he
must
have
money
and
that
immediately
if
not
the
whole
amount
half
at
all
events
the
witness
found
however
he
could
more
easily
raise
the
larger
than
the
smaller
sum
there
had
been
a
little
unpleasantness
between
him
and
elmsdale
with
reference
to
the
demand
for
money
made
so
suddenly
and
so
peremptorily
and
he
bitterly
regretted
having
even
for
a
moment
forgotten
what
was
due
to
so
kind
a
friend
he
knew
of
no
reason
in
the
world
why
elmsdale
should
have
committed
suicide
he
was
in
business
eminently
a
cautious
man
and
harringford
had
always
supposed
him
to
be
wealthy
in
fact
he
believed
him
to
be
a
man
of
large
property
since
the
death
of
his
wife
he
had
however
noticed
a
change
in
him
but
still
it
never
crossed
the
witness
mind
that
his
brain
was
in
any
way
affected
miss
blake
who
had
to
this
point
postponed
giving
her
evidence
on
account
of
the
way
she
was
upset
was
now
able
to
tell
a
sympathetic
jury
and
a
polite
coroner
all
she
knew
of
the
matter
indeed
she
began
robert
elmsdale
had
never
been
the
same
man
since
her
poor
sister
death
he
mooned
about
and
would
sit
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
doing
nothing
but
looking
at
a
faded
bit
of
the
carpet
he
took
no
interest
in
anything
if
he
was
asked
any
questions
about
the
garden
he
would
say
what
does
it
matter
can
not
see
it
now
indeed
my
lord
said
miss
blake
in
her
agitation
probably
confounding
the
coroner
with
the
chief
justice
it
was
just
pitiful
to
see
the
creature
i
am
sure
his
ways
got
to
be
after
my
sister
death
miss
blake
resumed
after
a
pause
devoted
by
herself
the
jury
and
the
coroner
to
sentiment
robert
elmsdale
gave
up
his
office
in
london
and
brought
his
business
home
i
do
not
know
why
he
did
this
he
would
not
had
she
been
living
because
he
always
kept
his
trade
well
out
of
her
sight
poor
man
being
what
she
was
she
could
not
endure
the
name
of
it
naturally
it
was
not
my
place
to
say
he
should
do
what
he
liked
in
his
own
house
and
i
thought
the
excitement
of
building
a
new
room
and
quarrelling
with
the
builder
and
swearing
at
the
men
was
good
for
him
he
made
a
fireproof
place
for
his
papers
and
he
fitted
up
the
office
like
a
library
and
bought
a
beautiful
large
table
covered
with
leather
and
nobody
to
have
gone
in
would
have
thought
the
room
was
used
for
business
he
had
a
turkey
carpet
on
the
floor
and
chairs
that
slipped
about
on
castors
and
he
planned
a
covered
way
out
into
the
road
with
a
separate
entrance
for
itself
so
that
none
of
us
ever
knew
who
went
out
or
who
came
in
he
kept
his
affairs
secret
as
the
grave
no
in
answer
to
the
coroner
who
began
to
think
miss
narrative
would
never
come
to
an
end
i
heard
no
shot
none
of
us
did
we
all
slept
away
from
that
part
of
the
house
but
i
was
restless
that
night
and
could
not
sleep
and
i
got
up
and
looked
out
at
the
river
and
saw
a
flare
of
light
on
it
i
thought
it
odd
he
was
not
gone
to
bed
but
took
little
notice
of
the
matter
for
a
couple
of
hours
more
when
it
was
just
getting
gray
in
the
morning
and
i
looked
out
again
and
still
seeing
the
light
slipped
on
a
and
my
slippers
and
ran
downstairs
to
tell
him
he
would
ruin
his
health
if
he
did
not
go
to
his
bed
when
i
opened
the
door
i
could
see
nothing
the
table
stood
between
me
and
him
but
the
gas
was
flaring
away
and
as
i
went
round
to
put
it
out
i
came
across
him
lying
on
the
floor
it
never
occurred
to
me
he
was
dead
i
thought
he
was
in
a
fit
and
knelt
down
to
unloose
his
cravat
then
i
found
he
had
gone
the
pistol
lay
on
the
carpet
beside
him
and
that
finished
miss
blake
is
all
i
have
to
tell
when
asked
if
she
had
ever
known
of
his
losing
money
by
betting
she
answered
it
was
not
likely
he
would
tell
her
anything
of
that
kind
he
always
kept
his
business
to
himself
she
affirmed
as
is
the
way
of
most
men
in
answer
to
other
questions
she
stated
she
never
heard
of
any
losses
in
business
there
was
plenty
of
money
always
to
be
had
for
the
asking
he
was
liberal
enough
though
perhaps
not
so
liberal
latterly
as
before
his
wife
death
she
did
know
anything
of
the
state
of
his
affairs
likely
craven
could
tell
them
all
about
that
craven
however
proved
unable
to
do
so
to
the
best
of
his
belief
elmsdale
was
in
very
easy
circumstances
he
had
transacted
a
large
amount
of
business
for
him
but
never
any
involving
pecuniary
loss
or
anxiety
he
should
have
thought
him
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
run
into
such
folly
as
betting
he
had
no
doubt
elmsdale
death
had
affected
him
disastrously
he
said
more
than
once
to
witness
if
it
were
not
for
the
sake
of
his
child
he
should
not
care
if
he
died
that
night
all
of
which
justifying
the
jury
in
returning
a
verdict
of
suicide
while
of
unsound
mind
they
expressed
their
unanimous
opinion
to
that
effect
thus
saving
the
family
the
condemnation
of
de
remarked
miss
blake
the
dead
man
was
buried
the
church
service
read
over
his
remains
the
household
was
put
into
mourning
the
blinds
were
drawn
up
the
windows
flung
open
and
the
business
of
life
taken
up
once
more
by
the
survivors
our
last
tenant
it
is
quite
competent
for
a
person
so
to
manage
his
affairs
that
whilst
understanding
all
about
them
himself
another
finds
it
next
to
impossible
to
make
head
or
tail
of
his
position
craven
found
that
elmsdale
had
effected
this
feat
entries
there
were
in
his
books
intelligible
enough
perhaps
to
the
man
who
made
them
but
as
so
much
hebrew
to
a
stranger
he
had
never
kept
a
business
banking
account
he
had
no
regular
journal
or
ledger
he
seemed
to
have
depended
on
memoranda
and
vague
and
uncertain
writings
in
his
diary
both
for
memory
and
accuracy
and
as
most
of
his
business
had
been
conducted
there
were
few
letters
to
assist
in
throwing
the
slightest
light
on
his
transactions
even
from
the
receipts
however
one
thing
was
clear
that
he
had
since
his
marriage
spent
a
very
large
sum
of
money
spent
it
lavishly
not
to
say
foolishly
indeed
the
more
closely
craven
looked
into
affairs
the
more
satisfied
he
felt
that
elmsdale
had
committed
suicide
simply
because
he
was
ruined
craven
himself
had
drawn
up
were
nowhere
to
be
found
neither
could
one
sovereign
of
the
money
harringford
paid
be
discovered
miss
blake
said
she
believed
that
harringford
had
never
paid
at
all
but
this
was
clearly
proved
to
be
an
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
that
impulsive
lady
not
merely
did
harringford
hold
the
receipt
for
the
money
and
the
cancelled
but
the
cheque
he
had
given
to
the
mortgagee
bore
the
endorsement
robert
elmsdale
while
the
clerk
who
cashed
it
stated
that
elmsdale
presented
the
order
in
person
and
that
to
him
he
handed
the
notes
whatever
he
had
done
with
the
money
no
notes
were
to
be
found
a
diligent
search
of
the
strong
room
produced
nothing
more
important
than
the
discovery
of
a
containing
three
hundred
pounds
the
of
river
hall
such
being
the
modest
name
by
which
elmsdale
had
elected
to
have
his
residence
distinguished
the
leases
relating
to
some
small
cottages
near
barnes
all
the
letters
his
wife
had
ever
written
to
him
two
locks
of
her
hair
one
given
before
marriage
the
other
cut
after
her
death
a
curl
severed
from
the
head
of
my
baby
daughter
quantities
of
receipts
and
nothing
more
i
wonder
he
can
rest
in
his
grave
said
miss
blake
when
at
last
she
began
to
realize
in
a
dim
sort
of
way
the
position
of
affairs
according
to
the
river
hall
servants
version
elmsdale
did
anything
rather
than
rest
in
his
grave
about
the
time
the
new
mourning
had
been
altered
to
fit
perfectly
a
nervous
housemaid
who
began
perhaps
to
find
the
house
dull
mooted
the
question
as
to
whether
master
walked
within
a
fortnight
it
was
decided
in
solemn
conclave
that
master
did
and
further
that
the
place
was
not
what
it
had
been
and
moreover
that
in
the
future
it
was
likely
to
be
still
less
like
what
it
had
been
there
is
a
wonderful
instinct
in
the
lower
classes
which
enables
them
to
comprehend
without
actual
knowledge
when
misfortune
is
coming
upon
a
house
and
in
this
instance
that
instinct
was
not
at
fault
long
before
craven
had
satisfied
himself
that
his
client
estate
was
a
very
poor
one
the
river
hall
servants
one
after
another
had
given
notice
to
leave
indeed
to
speak
more
accurately
they
did
not
give
notice
for
they
left
and
before
they
left
they
took
care
to
baptize
the
house
with
such
an
exceedingly
bad
name
that
neither
for
love
nor
money
could
miss
blake
get
a
fresh
help
to
stay
in
it
for
more
than
hours
first
one
housemaid
was
taken
with
the
shivers
then
the
cook
had
the
trembles
then
the
coachman
was
prepared
to
take
his
solemn
affidavit
that
one
night
long
after
everyone
in
the
house
to
his
knowledge
was
in
bed
he
see
from
his
room
above
the
stables
a
light
on
the
thames
and
the
figures
of
one
or
more
a
passing
and
a
repassing
across
the
blind
more
than
this
a
new
declared
that
on
a
certain
evening
before
he
had
been
told
there
was
anything
strange
about
the
house
he
heard
the
door
of
the
passage
leading
from
the
library
into
the
slam
violently
and
looking
to
see
who
had
gone
out
by
that
unused
entrance
failed
to
perceive
sign
of
man
woman
or
child
by
the
bright
moonlight
moved
by
some
feeling
which
he
professed
himself
unable
to
put
a
name
on
he
proceeded
to
the
door
in
question
and
found
it
barred
chained
and
bolted
while
he
was
standing
wondering
what
it
meant
he
noticed
the
light
as
of
gas
shining
from
underneath
the
library
door
but
when
he
softly
turned
the
handle
and
peeped
in
the
room
was
dark
as
the
grave
and
like
cold
water
seemed
running
down
his
back
further
he
averred
as
he
stole
away
into
the
hall
there
was
a
sound
followed
him
as
between
a
groan
and
a
cry
hearing
which
statement
an
impressionable
charwoman
went
into
hysterics
and
had
to
be
recalled
to
her
senses
by
a
dose
of
gin
suggested
and
taken
strictly
as
a
medicine
but
no
supply
of
spirituous
liquors
even
had
miss
blake
been
disposed
to
distribute
anything
of
the
sort
could
induce
servants
after
a
time
to
remain
in
or
charwomen
to
come
to
the
house
it
had
received
a
bad
name
and
that
goes
even
further
in
disfavour
of
a
residence
than
it
does
against
a
man
or
woman
finally
miss
blake
establishment
was
limited
to
an
old
creature
almost
doting
and
totally
deaf
the
advantages
of
whose
presence
might
have
been
considered
problematical
but
then
as
miss
blake
remarked
she
was
somebody
and
now
she
has
taken
fright
proceeded
the
lady
how
anyone
could
make
her
hear
their
story
the
lord
in
heaven
alone
knows
and
if
there
was
anything
to
see
i
am
sure
she
is
far
too
blind
to
see
it
but
she
says
she
dare
stay
she
does
not
want
to
see
poor
master
again
till
she
is
dead
herself
i
have
got
a
tenant
for
the
house
the
moment
you
like
to
say
you
will
leave
it
said
craven
in
reply
he
cares
for
no
ghost
that
ever
was
manufactured
he
has
a
wife
with
a
splendid
digestion
and
several
sons
and
daughters
they
will
soon
clear
out
the
shadows
and
their
father
is
willing
to
pay
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
you
think
there
is
really
nothing
more
of
any
use
amongst
the
papers
i
am
afraid
not
i
am
afraid
you
must
face
the
worst
and
my
sister
child
left
no
better
off
than
a
street
beggar
suggested
miss
blake
come
come
remonstrated
craven
matters
are
not
so
bad
as
all
that
comes
to
upon
three
hundred
a
year
you
can
live
very
comfortable
on
the
continent
and
we
go
interrupted
miss
blake
but
it
is
hard
lines
not
that
anything
better
could
have
been
expected
from
robert
elmsdale
ah
dear
miss
blake
the
poor
fellow
is
dead
remember
only
his
virtues
and
let
his
faults
rest
i
have
much
to
burden
my
memory
with
then
retorted
miss
blake
and
departed
her
next
letter
to
my
principal
was
dated
from
rouen
but
before
that
reached
buckingham
street
our
troubles
had
begun
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
treseby
the
country
squire
possessed
of
a
wife
with
an
excellent
digestion
at
the
end
of
two
months
handed
us
half
a
year
rent
and
requested
we
should
try
to
let
the
house
for
the
remainder
of
his
term
he
in
case
of
our
failure
continuing
amenable
for
the
rent
in
the
course
of
the
three
years
we
secured
eight
tenants
and
as
from
each
a
profit
in
the
way
of
forfeit
accrued
we
had
not
to
trouble
treseby
for
any
more
money
and
were
also
enabled
to
remit
some
small
bonuses
which
came
to
her
miss
blake
assured
us
as
godsends
to
the
continent
after
that
the
place
stood
vacant
for
a
time
various
were
eager
to
obtain
the
charge
of
it
but
i
only
remember
one
who
was
not
eager
to
leave
that
was
a
who
never
went
home
except
in
the
daytime
and
then
to
sleep
and
he
failed
to
understand
why
his
wife
who
was
a
pretty
delicate
little
creature
and
the
mother
of
four
small
children
should
quarrel
with
her
bread
and
butter
and
want
to
leave
so
fine
a
place
he
argued
the
matter
with
her
in
so
practical
a
fashion
that
the
nearest
magistrate
had
to
be
elected
umpire
between
them
the
whole
story
of
the
place
was
repeated
in
court
and
the
wife
who
sobbed
during
the
entire
time
she
stood
in
the
made
light
of
her
black
eye
and
numerous
bruises
but
said
not
if
tim
murdered
her
could
she
stay
alone
in
the
house
another
night
to
prevent
him
murdering
her
he
was
sent
to
gaol
for
two
months
and
craven
allowed
her
eight
shillings
a
week
till
tim
was
once
more
a
free
man
when
he
absconded
leaving
wife
and
children
chargeable
to
the
parish
a
poor
nervous
creature
said
craven
who
would
not
believe
that
where
gas
was
any
house
could
be
we
must
really
try
to
let
the
house
in
earnest
and
we
did
try
and
we
did
let
over
and
over
and
over
again
always
with
a
like
result
till
at
length
craven
said
to
me
do
you
know
patterson
i
really
am
growing
very
uneasy
about
that
house
on
the
thames
i
am
afraid
some
person
is
trying
to
keep
it
vacant
it
certainly
is
very
strange
was
the
only
remark
i
felt
capable
of
making
we
had
joked
so
much
about
the
house
amongst
ourselves
and
ridiculed
miss
blake
and
her
troubles
to
such
an
extent
that
the
matter
bore
no
serious
aspect
for
any
of
us
juniors
if
we
are
not
soon
able
to
let
it
went
on
craven
i
shall
advise
miss
blake
to
auction
off
the
furniture
and
sell
the
place
we
must
not
always
have
an
uninhabited
house
haunting
our
offices
patterson
i
shook
my
head
in
grave
assent
but
all
the
time
i
was
thinking
the
day
when
that
house
ceased
to
haunt
our
offices
would
be
a
very
dreary
one
for
the
wags
amongst
our
clerks
yes
i
certainly
shall
advise
miss
blake
to
sell
repeated
craven
slowly
although
a
man
he
was
eminently
slow
in
his
ideas
and
actions
there
was
nothing
express
about
our
dear
governor
upon
no
special
mental
train
did
he
go
careering
through
life
eminently
he
preferred
the
parliamentary
pace
and
i
am
bound
to
say
the
so
performed
was
beautiful
exceedingly
with
waits
not
devoid
of
interest
at
little
stations
utterly
outside
his
profession
with
kindly
talk
to
little
children
and
timid
women
and
feeble
men
with
a
pleasant
smile
for
most
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
and
time
for
words
of
kindly
advice
which
did
not
fall
perpetually
on
stony
ground
but
which
sometimes
grew
to
maturity
and
produced
rich
grain
of
which
himself
beheld
the
garnering
nevertheless
to
my
younger
and
quicker
nature
he
did
seem
often
very
tardy
why
not
advise
her
now
i
asked
ah
my
boy
he
answered
life
is
very
short
yet
it
is
long
enough
to
have
no
need
in
it
for
hurry
the
same
day
colonel
morris
appeared
in
our
office
within
a
fortnight
that
gallant
officer
was
our
tenant
within
a
month
morris
an
exceedingly
fine
lady
with
children
with
very
young
children
also
with
ayahs
with
native
servants
with
english
servants
with
a
list
of
acquaintances
such
as
one
may
read
of
in
the
papers
the
day
after
a
queen
took
possession
of
the
uninhabited
house
and
for
about
three
months
peace
reigned
in
our
dominions
buckingham
street
as
represented
by
us
stank
in
the
nostrils
of
no
human
being
so
far
we
were
innocent
of
offence
we
were
simply
ordinary
solicitors
and
clerks
doing
as
fully
and
truly
as
we
knew
how
an
extremely
good
business
at
rates
which
yielded
a
very
fair
return
to
our
principal
the
colonel
was
delighted
with
the
place
he
kindly
called
to
say
so
was
morris
so
were
the
sons
and
daughters
of
colonel
and
morris
and
so
it
is
to
be
presumed
were
the
infant
branches
of
the
family
the
native
servants
liked
the
place
because
elmsdale
in
view
of
his
wife
delicate
health
had
made
the
house
like
an
oven
to
quote
miss
blake
it
was
bad
for
her
i
know
proceeded
that
lady
but
she
would
have
her
own
way
poor
soul
and
he
well
he
have
had
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
of
a
house
off
if
she
had
taken
a
fancy
for
that
article
those
stoves
and
pipes
were
a
great
bait
to
colonel
morris
as
well
as
a
source
of
physical
enjoyment
to
his
servants
he
too
had
married
a
woman
who
was
not
always
easy
to
please
but
river
hall
did
please
her
as
was
natural
with
its
luxuries
of
heat
ease
convenience
large
rooms
opening
one
out
of
another
wide
verandahs
overlooking
the
thames
staircases
easy
of
ascent
baths
hot
cold
and
shower
a
sweet
pretty
garden
conservatory
with
a
door
leading
into
it
from
the
spacious
hall
all
exceedingly
cheap
at
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
accordingly
at
first
the
colonel
was
delighted
with
the
place
and
not
the
less
so
because
morris
was
delighted
with
it
and
because
it
was
also
so
far
from
town
that
he
had
a
remarkably
good
excuse
for
frequently
visiting
his
club
before
the
local
tradesmen
bowed
down
and
did
worship
visitors
came
and
visitors
went
carriages
appeared
in
shoals
and
were
plentiful
as
blackberries
a
fresh
leaf
had
evidently
been
turned
over
at
river
hall
and
the
place
meant
to
give
no
more
trouble
for
ever
to
miss
blake
or
craven
or
anybody
so
as
i
have
said
three
months
passed
we
had
got
well
into
the
by
that
time
there
was
very
little
to
do
in
the
office
craven
had
left
for
his
annual
holiday
which
he
always
took
in
the
company
of
his
wife
and
daughters
a
correct
but
possibly
a
depressing
way
of
spending
a
vacation
which
must
have
been
intended
to
furnish
some
social
variety
in
a
man
life
and
we
were
all
very
idle
and
all
very
much
inclined
to
grumble
at
the
heat
and
length
and
general
slowness
of
the
days
when
one
morning
as
i
was
going
out
in
order
to
send
a
parcel
off
to
craven
who
should
i
meet
coming
panting
up
the
stairs
but
miss
blake
is
that
you
patterson
she
gasped
i
assured
her
it
was
i
in
the
flesh
and
intimated
my
astonishment
at
seeing
her
in
hers
why
i
thought
you
were
in
france
miss
blake
i
suggested
that
where
i
have
just
come
from
she
said
is
craven
in
i
told
her
he
was
out
of
town
ay
that
where
everybody
can
be
but
me
she
remarked
plaintively
they
can
go
out
and
stay
out
while
i
am
at
the
beck
and
call
of
all
the
scum
of
the
earth
well
well
i
suppose
there
will
be
quiet
for
me
sometime
if
only
in
my
coffin
as
i
failed
to
see
that
any
consolatory
answer
was
possible
i
made
no
reply
i
only
asked
wo
you
walk
into
craven
office
miss
blake
now
i
wonder
she
said
what
good
you
think
walking
into
his
office
will
do
me
nevertheless
she
accepted
the
invitation
i
have
in
the
course
of
years
seen
many
persons
suffering
from
heat
but
i
never
did
see
any
human
being
in
such
a
state
as
miss
blake
was
that
day
her
face
was
a
pure
rich
red
from
temple
to
chin
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
brick
which
had
been
out
for
a
long
time
first
in
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
then
in
a
succession
of
heavy
showers
of
rain
she
looked
and
and
sprayed
with
all
at
once
her
eyes
were
a
lighter
blue
than
i
previously
thought
eyes
could
be
her
stood
out
more
prominently
than
i
had
thought
capable
of
doing
her
mouth
not
quite
a
bad
one
by
the
way
opened
wider
than
any
within
my
experience
and
her
teeth
white
and
exposed
were
suggestive
of
a
set
of
tombstones
planted
outside
a
stonemason
shop
or
an
upper
and
lower
set
exhibited
at
the
entrance
to
a
dentist
poor
dear
miss
blake
she
and
those
pronounced
teeth
parted
company
long
ago
and
a
much
more
becoming
set
which
she
got
exceedingly
cheap
by
agreeing
with
the
maker
to
send
the
whole
of
the
city
of
london
to
her
if
he
liked
now
occupy
their
place
but
on
that
especial
morning
they
were
very
prominent
everything
in
fact
about
the
lady
or
belonging
to
her
seemed
exaggerated
as
if
the
heat
of
the
weather
had
induced
a
tropical
growth
of
her
mental
and
bodily
peculiarities
her
bonnet
was
crooked
beyond
even
the
ordinary
capacity
of
miss
blake
the
strings
were
rolled
up
till
they
looked
like
ropes
which
had
been
knotted
under
her
chin
a
veil
as
large
and
black
as
a
pirate
flag
floated
down
her
back
her
shawl
was
at
sixes
and
sevens
one
side
of
her
dress
had
got
torn
from
the
bodice
and
trailed
on
the
ground
leaving
a
line
of
dust
on
the
carpet
she
looked
as
if
she
had
no
petticoats
on
and
her
boots
those
were
the
days
ere
and
buttons
obtained
were
one
laced
unevenly
and
the
other
tied
on
with
a
piece
of
ribbon
as
for
her
gloves
they
were
in
the
state
we
always
beheld
them
if
she
ever
bought
a
new
pair
which
i
do
not
believe
she
never
treated
us
to
a
sight
of
them
till
they
had
been
long
past
decent
service
they
never
were
buttoned
to
begin
with
they
had
a
wrinkled
and
haggard
appearance
as
if
from
extreme
old
age
if
their
colour
had
originally
been
lavender
they
were
always
black
with
dirt
if
black
they
were
white
with
wear
as
a
bad
job
she
had
apparently
years
before
given
up
putting
a
stitch
in
the
ends
of
the
fingers
when
a
stitch
gave
way
and
the
consequence
was
that
we
were
perfectly
familiar
with
miss
nails
and
those
nails
looked
as
if
at
an
early
period
of
her
life
a
hammer
had
been
brought
heavily
down
upon
them
elmsdale
might
well
be
a
beauty
for
she
had
taken
not
only
her
own
share
of
the
good
looks
of
the
family
but
her
sister
also
we
used
often
at
the
office
to
marvel
why
miss
blake
ever
wore
a
collar
or
a
tucker
or
a
frill
or
a
pair
of
cuffs
so
far
as
clean
linen
was
concerned
she
would
have
appeared
infinitely
brighter
and
fresher
had
she
and
female
frippery
at
once
parted
company
her
laces
were
always
in
tatters
her
collars
soiled
her
cuffs
torn
and
her
frills
limp
i
wonder
what
the
natives
thought
of
her
in
france
in
london
we
decided
and
accurately
i
believe
that
miss
blake
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
chamber
washed
and
her
cambrics
and
fine
linen
and
it
was
a
and
a
as
well
had
any
other
woman
dressed
like
miss
blake
come
to
our
office
i
fear
the
clerks
would
not
have
been
to
her
but
miss
blake
was
our
own
our
very
own
she
had
grown
to
be
as
our
very
flesh
and
blood
we
did
not
love
her
but
she
was
associated
with
us
by
the
closest
ties
that
can
subsist
between
lawyer
and
client
had
anything
happened
to
miss
blake
we
should
in
the
event
of
her
death
have
gone
in
a
body
to
her
funeral
and
felt
a
want
in
our
lives
for
ever
after
but
miss
blake
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
dying
we
were
not
afraid
of
that
calamity
the
only
thing
we
really
did
dread
was
that
some
day
she
might
insist
upon
laying
the
blame
of
river
hall
remaining
uninhabited
on
our
shoulders
and
demand
that
craven
should
pay
her
the
rent
out
of
his
own
pocket
we
knew
if
she
took
that
or
any
other
pecuniary
matter
seriously
in
hand
she
would
carry
it
through
and
between
jest
and
earnest
we
were
wont
to
speculate
whether
in
the
end
it
might
not
prove
cheaper
to
our
firm
if
craven
were
to
farm
that
place
and
pay
miss
blake
niece
an
annuity
of
say
one
hundred
a
year
ultimately
we
decided
that
it
would
but
that
such
a
scheme
was
impracticable
because
miss
blake
would
always
think
we
were
making
a
fortune
out
of
river
hall
and
give
us
no
peace
till
she
had
a
share
of
the
profit
for
a
time
miss
blake
after
unfastening
her
and
taking
out
her
brooch
and
throwing
back
her
shawl
sat
fanning
herself
with
a
dilapidated
glove
and
saying
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
can
not
imagine
but
at
length
finding
i
was
not
to
be
betrayed
into
questioning
she
observed
if
william
craven
knew
the
distress
i
am
in
he
would
not
be
out
of
town
enjoying
himself
i
be
bound
i
am
quite
certain
he
would
not
i
answered
boldly
but
as
he
is
away
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
for
you
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
you
all
a
parcel
of
boys
and
children
together
was
her
comprehensive
answer
but
there
is
our
manager
taylor
i
suggested
him
she
exclaimed
now
if
you
do
want
me
to
walk
out
of
the
office
and
never
set
foot
in
it
again
do
talk
to
me
about
taylor
has
taylor
offended
you
i
ventured
to
inquire
lads
of
your
age
should
not
ask
too
many
questions
she
replied
what
i
have
against
taylor
is
nothing
to
you
only
do
make
me
desperate
by
mentioning
his
name
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
it
should
never
be
uttered
by
me
again
in
her
presence
and
there
ensued
a
pause
which
she
filled
by
looking
round
the
office
and
taking
a
mental
inventory
of
everything
it
contained
eventually
her
survey
ended
in
this
remark
and
he
can
go
out
of
town
as
well
and
keep
a
brougham
for
his
wife
and
draw
them
daughters
of
his
out
like
figures
in
a
and
my
poor
sister
child
living
in
a
lodging
i
fear
miss
blake
i
ventured
that
something
is
the
matter
at
river
hall
you
fear
do
you
young
man
she
returned
you
ought
to
get
a
first
prize
for
guessing
as
if
anything
else
could
ever
bring
me
back
to
london
can
i
be
of
no
service
to
you
in
the
matter
i
do
think
you
can
but
you
may
as
well
see
his
letter
and
diving
into
the
depths
of
her
pocket
she
produced
colonel
communication
which
was
very
short
but
very
much
to
the
purpose
not
wishing
he
said
to
behave
in
any
unhandsome
manner
i
send
you
herewith
herewith
meant
the
keys
of
river
hall
and
his
letter
a
cheque
for
one
rent
you
must
know
that
had
i
been
aware
of
the
antecedents
of
the
place
i
should
never
have
become
your
tenant
and
i
must
say
considering
i
have
a
wife
in
delicate
health
and
young
children
the
deception
practised
by
your
lawyers
in
concealing
the
fact
that
no
previous
occupant
has
been
able
to
remain
in
the
house
seems
most
unpardonable
i
am
a
soldier
and
to
me
these
trade
tricks
appear
dishonourable
still
as
i
understand
your
position
is
an
exceptional
one
i
am
willing
to
forgive
the
wrong
which
has
been
done
and
to
pay
six
months
rent
for
a
house
i
shall
no
longer
occupy
in
the
event
of
these
concessions
appearing
insufficient
i
beg
to
enclose
the
names
of
my
solicitors
and
have
the
honour
madam
to
remain
your
most
obedient
servant
hercules
morris
in
order
to
gain
time
i
read
this
letter
twice
over
then
diplomatically
as
i
thought
i
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
miss
blake
what
are
going
to
do
is
much
nearer
the
point
i
am
thinking
retorted
that
lady
do
you
imagine
there
is
so
much
pleasure
or
profit
in
keeping
a
lawyer
that
people
want
to
do
lawyer
work
for
themselves
which
really
was
hard
upon
us
all
considering
that
so
long
as
she
could
do
her
work
for
herself
miss
blake
ignored
both
craven
and
his
clerks
not
a
shilling
of
money
would
she
ever
if
she
could
help
it
permit
to
pass
through
our
hands
not
the
slightest
chance
did
she
ever
voluntarily
give
craven
of
recouping
himself
those
costs
or
loans
in
which
her
acquaintance
involved
her
sister
former
suitor
had
he
felt
any
inclination
which
i
am
quite
certain
he
never
did
to
deduct
miss
helena
indebtedness
as
represented
by
her
aunt
out
of
miss
helena
income
he
could
not
have
done
it
the
tenant
money
usually
went
straight
into
miss
blake
hands
what
she
did
with
it
heaven
only
knows
i
know
she
did
not
buy
herself
gloves
twirling
the
colonel
letter
about
i
thought
the
position
over
what
then
i
asked
do
you
wish
us
to
do
habited
as
i
have
attempted
to
describe
miss
blake
sat
at
one
side
of
a
in
i
flatter
myself
a
decent
suit
of
clothes
washed
brushed
shaved
i
sat
on
the
other
to
ordinary
observers
i
know
i
must
have
seemed
much
the
best
man
of
the
two
yet
miss
blake
got
the
better
of
me
she
that
dilapidated
woman
looked
me
over
from
head
to
foot
as
i
conceived
though
my
boots
were
hidden
away
under
the
table
and
i
declare
i
swear
she
put
me
out
of
countenance
i
felt
small
under
the
stare
of
a
person
with
whom
i
would
not
then
have
walked
through
hyde
park
in
the
afternoon
for
almost
any
amount
of
money
which
could
have
been
offered
to
me
though
you
are
only
a
clerk
she
said
at
length
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
the
effect
she
had
produced
you
seem
a
very
decent
sort
of
young
man
as
craven
is
out
of
the
way
suppose
you
go
and
see
that
morris
man
and
ask
him
what
he
means
by
his
impudent
letter
i
rose
to
the
bait
being
in
craven
employment
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
i
in
common
with
every
other
person
about
the
place
thought
i
could
manage
his
business
for
him
very
much
better
than
he
could
manage
it
for
himself
and
it
had
always
been
my
own
personal
conviction
that
if
the
letting
of
the
uninhabited
house
were
entrusted
to
me
the
place
would
not
stand
long
empty
miss
blake
proposition
was
therefore
most
agreeable
but
still
i
did
not
at
once
swallow
her
hook
craven
i
felt
might
scarcely
approve
of
my
taking
it
upon
myself
to
call
upon
colonel
morris
while
taylor
was
able
and
willing
to
venture
upon
such
a
step
and
i
therefore
suggested
to
our
client
the
advisability
of
first
asking
craven
opinion
about
the
affair
and
keep
me
in
suspense
while
you
are
writing
and
answering
and
running
up
a
bill
as
long
as
midsummer
day
she
retorted
no
thank
you
if
you
do
think
my
business
worth
your
attention
i
go
to
somebody
that
may
be
glad
of
it
and
she
began
tying
her
strings
and
feeling
after
her
shawl
in
a
manner
which
looked
very
much
indeed
like
carrying
out
her
threat
at
that
moment
i
made
up
my
mind
to
consult
taylor
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
so
i
appeased
miss
blake
by
assuring
her
in
a
diplomatic
manner
that
colonel
morris
should
be
visited
and
promising
to
communicate
the
result
of
the
interview
by
letter
that
you
wo
she
answered
i
be
here
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
he
is
just
tired
of
the
house
like
the
rest
of
them
and
wants
to
be
rid
of
his
bargain
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
that
i
said
remembering
my
suggestion
it
is
strange
if
there
really
is
nothing
objectionable
about
the
house
that
can
be
found
to
stay
in
it
craven
has
hinted
that
he
fancies
some
person
must
be
playing
tricks
in
order
to
frighten
tenants
away
it
is
likely
enough
she
agreed
robert
elmsdale
had
plenty
of
enemies
and
few
friends
but
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
starve
is
it
i
failed
to
see
the
logical
sequence
of
miss
blake
remark
nevertheless
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
so
and
agreed
it
was
no
reason
why
she
and
her
niece
should
be
driven
into
that
workhouse
which
she
frequently
declared
they
must
come
to
remember
were
her
parting
words
i
shall
be
here
morning
early
and
expect
you
to
have
good
news
for
me
inwardly
resolving
not
to
be
in
the
way
i
said
i
hoped
there
would
be
good
news
for
her
and
went
in
search
of
taylor
miss
blake
has
been
here
i
began
the
house
is
empty
again
colonel
morris
has
sent
her
half
a
year
rent
the
keys
and
the
address
of
his
solicitors
he
says
we
have
acted
disgracefully
in
the
matter
and
she
wants
me
to
go
and
see
him
and
declares
she
will
be
back
here
first
thing
morning
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
what
ought
i
to
do
before
taylor
answered
my
question
he
delivered
himself
of
a
comprehensive
anathema
which
included
miss
blake
river
hall
the
late
owner
and
ourselves
he
further
wished
he
might
be
essentially
etceteraed
if
he
believed
there
was
another
solicitor
besides
craven
in
london
who
would
allow
such
a
hag
to
haunt
his
offices
talk
about
river
hall
being
haunted
he
finished
it
is
we
who
are
i
call
it
by
that
old
irishwoman
she
ought
to
be
burnt
at
smithfield
i
be
at
the
expense
of
the
faggots
what
have
you
and
miss
blake
quarrelled
about
i
inquired
you
say
she
is
a
witch
and
she
has
made
me
take
a
solemn
oath
never
to
mention
your
name
again
in
her
presence
i
keep
her
presence
out
of
these
offices
if
i
was
craven
he
answered
she
has
cost
us
more
than
the
whole
freehold
of
river
hall
is
worth
something
in
his
manner
more
than
in
his
words
made
me
comprehend
that
miss
blake
had
borrowed
money
from
him
and
not
repaid
it
so
i
did
not
press
for
further
explanation
but
only
asked
him
once
again
what
i
ought
to
do
about
calling
upon
colonel
morris
call
and
be
hanged
if
you
like
was
the
reply
and
as
taylor
was
not
usually
a
man
given
to
violent
language
i
understood
that
miss
blake
name
acted
upon
his
temper
with
the
same
magical
effect
as
a
red
rag
does
upon
that
of
a
myself
and
miss
blake
colonel
morris
after
leaving
river
hall
had
migrated
temporarily
to
a
fashionable
west
end
hotel
and
was
when
i
called
to
see
him
partaking
of
tiffin
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
instead
of
at
his
club
as
it
was
notorious
that
he
and
morris
failed
to
lead
the
most
harmonious
of
lives
i
did
not
feel
surprised
to
find
him
in
an
extremely
bad
temper
in
person
short
dapper
wiry
thin
and
precise
his
manner
matched
his
appearance
he
had
martinet
written
on
every
square
foot
of
his
figure
his
moustache
was
fiercely
waxed
his
inflexible
his
backbone
stiff
while
his
met
flat
and
even
behind
he
held
his
chin
a
little
up
in
the
air
and
his
walk
was
less
a
march
than
a
strut
he
came
into
the
room
where
i
had
been
waiting
for
him
as
i
fancied
he
might
have
come
on
a
wet
cold
morning
to
meet
an
he
held
the
card
i
sent
for
his
inspection
in
his
hand
and
referred
to
it
after
he
had
looked
me
over
with
a
supercilious
glance
patterson
from
craven
and
son
he
read
slowly
out
loud
and
then
added
may
i
inquire
what
patterson
from
craven
and
son
wants
with
me
i
come
from
miss
blake
sir
i
remarked
it
is
here
written
that
you
come
from
craven
and
son
he
said
so
i
do
sir
upon
miss
blake
business
she
is
a
client
of
ours
as
you
may
remember
i
do
remember
go
on
he
would
not
sit
down
himself
or
ask
me
to
be
seated
so
we
stood
throughout
the
interview
i
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
he
twirling
his
moustache
or
scrutinising
his
nails
while
he
talked
miss
blake
has
received
a
letter
from
you
sir
and
has
requested
me
to
ask
you
for
an
explanation
of
it
i
have
no
further
explanation
to
give
he
replied
but
as
you
took
the
house
for
two
years
we
can
not
advise
miss
blake
to
allow
you
to
relinquish
possession
in
consideration
of
your
having
paid
her
six
months
rent
very
well
then
you
can
advise
her
to
fight
the
matter
as
i
suppose
you
will
i
am
prepared
to
fight
it
we
never
like
fighting
if
a
matter
can
be
arranged
amicably
i
answered
craven
is
at
present
out
of
town
but
i
know
i
am
only
speaking
his
words
when
i
say
we
shall
be
glad
to
advise
miss
blake
to
accept
any
reasonable
proposition
which
you
may
feel
inclined
to
make
i
have
sent
her
half
a
year
rent
was
his
reply
and
i
have
refrained
from
prosecuting
you
all
for
conspiracy
as
i
am
told
i
might
have
done
lawyers
i
am
aware
admit
they
have
no
consciences
and
i
can
make
some
allowance
for
a
person
in
miss
blake
position
otherwise
yes
sir
i
said
interrogatively
i
should
never
have
paid
one
penny
it
has
i
find
been
a
fact
to
craven
as
well
as
to
miss
blake
that
no
tenant
can
remain
in
river
hall
when
my
wife
was
first
taken
ill
there
in
consequence
of
the
frightful
shock
she
received
i
sent
for
the
nearest
medical
man
and
he
refused
to
come
absolutely
sent
me
a
note
saying
was
very
sorry
but
he
must
decline
to
attend
morris
doubtless
she
had
her
own
physician
who
would
be
happy
to
devote
himself
to
the
case
and
what
did
you
do
i
asked
my
pulses
tingling
with
awakened
curiosity
do
he
repeated
pleased
perhaps
to
find
so
appreciative
a
listener
i
sent
of
course
for
the
best
advice
to
be
had
in
london
and
i
went
to
the
local
doctor
a
man
who
keeps
a
surgery
and
dispenses
medicines
myself
to
ask
what
he
meant
by
returning
such
an
insolent
message
in
answer
to
my
summons
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
said
by
way
of
apology
i
can
not
imagine
i
replied
he
said
he
would
not
for
ten
times
over
the
value
of
all
the
river
hall
patients
attend
a
case
in
the
house
again
person
can
live
in
it
he
went
on
keep
his
her
or
its
health
whether
it
is
the
river
or
the
drains
or
the
late
owner
or
the
devil
i
have
not
an
idea
i
can
only
tell
you
no
one
has
been
able
to
remain
in
it
since
elmsdale
death
and
if
i
attend
a
case
there
of
course
i
say
get
out
of
this
at
once
then
comes
miss
blake
and
threatens
me
with
assault
and
battery
swears
she
will
bring
an
action
against
me
for
libelling
the
place
declares
i
wish
to
drive
her
and
her
niece
to
the
workhouse
and
asserts
i
am
in
league
with
some
one
who
wants
to
keep
the
house
vacant
and
i
am
sick
of
it
get
what
doctor
you
choose
but
do
send
for
me
well
sir
i
suggested
well
i
do
consider
it
well
at
all
here
am
i
a
man
returning
to
his
native
country
and
a
beastly
country
it
is
after
nearly
thirty
years
absence
and
the
first
transaction
upon
which
i
engage
proves
a
swindle
yes
a
swindle
patterson
i
went
to
you
in
all
good
faith
took
that
house
at
your
own
rent
thought
i
had
got
a
desirable
home
and
believed
i
was
dealing
with
respectable
people
and
now
i
find
i
was
utterly
deceived
both
as
regards
the
place
and
your
probity
you
knew
the
house
was
uninhabitable
and
yet
you
let
it
to
me
i
give
you
my
word
i
said
that
we
really
do
not
know
yet
in
what
way
the
house
is
uninhabitable
it
is
a
good
house
as
you
know
it
is
well
furnished
the
drainage
is
perfect
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
do
not
believe
a
fault
can
be
found
with
the
place
still
it
has
been
a
fact
that
tenants
will
not
stay
in
it
and
we
were
therefore
glad
to
let
it
to
a
gentleman
like
yourself
who
would
we
expected
prove
above
subscribing
to
that
which
can
only
be
a
vulgar
prejudice
what
is
a
vulgar
prejudice
he
asked
the
idea
that
river
hall
is
haunted
i
replied
river
hall
is
haunted
young
man
he
said
solemnly
by
what
i
asked
by
some
one
who
can
not
rest
in
his
grave
was
the
answer
colonel
morris
i
said
some
one
be
playing
tricks
in
the
house
if
so
that
some
one
does
not
belong
to
this
world
he
remarked
do
you
mean
really
and
seriously
to
tell
me
you
believe
in
ghosts
i
asked
perhaps
a
little
scornfully
i
do
and
if
you
had
lived
in
river
hall
you
would
believe
in
them
too
he
replied
i
will
tell
you
he
went
on
what
i
saw
in
the
house
myself
you
know
the
library
i
nodded
in
assent
we
did
know
the
library
there
our
trouble
seemed
to
have
taken
up
its
abode
are
you
aware
lights
have
frequently
been
reflected
from
that
room
when
no
light
has
actually
been
in
it
i
could
only
admit
this
had
occasionally
proved
a
ground
of
what
we
considered
unreasonable
complaint
one
evening
went
on
the
colonel
i
determined
to
test
the
matter
for
myself
long
before
dusk
i
entered
the
room
and
examined
it
thoroughly
saw
to
the
fastenings
of
the
windows
drew
up
the
blinds
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
after
dinner
i
took
a
cigar
and
walked
up
and
down
the
grass
path
beside
the
river
until
dark
there
was
no
light
not
a
sign
of
light
of
any
kind
as
i
turned
once
more
and
walked
up
the
path
again
but
as
i
was
retracing
my
steps
i
saw
that
the
room
was
brilliantly
illuminated
i
rushed
to
the
nearest
window
and
looked
in
the
gas
was
all
ablaze
the
door
of
the
strong
room
open
the
table
strewed
with
papers
while
in
an
drawn
close
up
to
the
largest
drawer
a
man
was
seated
counting
over
he
had
a
pile
of
them
before
him
and
i
distinctly
saw
that
he
wetted
his
fingers
in
order
to
separate
them
most
extraordinary
i
exclaimed
i
could
not
decently
have
said
anything
less
but
i
confess
that
i
had
in
my
recollection
the
fact
of
colonel
morris
having
dined
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
story
is
still
to
come
he
remarked
i
hurried
at
once
into
the
house
unlocked
the
door
found
the
library
in
pitch
darkness
and
when
i
lit
the
gas
the
strong
room
was
closed
there
was
no
in
the
room
no
papers
were
on
the
table
everything
in
fact
was
precisely
in
the
same
condition
as
i
had
left
it
a
few
hours
before
now
no
person
in
the
flesh
could
have
performed
such
a
feat
as
that
i
can
not
agree
with
you
there
i
ventured
it
seems
to
me
less
difficult
to
believe
the
whole
thing
a
trick
than
to
attribute
the
occurrence
to
supernatural
agency
in
fact
while
i
do
not
say
it
is
impossible
for
ghosts
to
be
i
can
not
accept
the
fact
of
their
existence
well
i
can
then
retorted
the
colonel
why
sir
once
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
there
he
paused
apparently
he
recollected
just
in
time
that
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
a
long
way
from
river
hall
and
morris
i
suggested
leading
him
back
to
the
banks
of
the
thames
you
mentioned
some
shock
yes
he
said
frankly
she
met
the
same
person
on
the
staircase
i
saw
in
the
library
he
carried
in
one
hand
a
lighted
candle
and
in
the
other
a
bundle
of
he
never
looked
at
her
as
he
passed
never
turned
his
head
to
the
spot
where
she
stood
gazing
after
him
in
a
perfect
access
of
terror
but
walked
quietly
downstairs
crossed
the
hall
and
went
straight
into
the
library
without
opening
the
door
she
fainted
dead
away
and
has
never
known
an
hour
good
health
since
according
to
all
accounts
she
had
not
before
or
good
temper
either
i
thought
but
i
only
said
you
had
told
morris
i
presume
of
your
adventure
in
the
library
no
he
answered
i
had
not
i
did
not
mention
it
to
anyone
except
a
brother
officer
who
dined
with
me
the
next
evening
your
conversation
with
him
might
have
been
overheard
i
suppose
i
urged
it
is
possible
but
scarcely
probable
he
replied
at
all
events
i
am
quite
certain
it
never
reached
my
wife
ears
or
she
would
not
have
stayed
another
night
in
the
house
i
stood
for
a
few
moments
irresolute
but
then
i
spoke
i
told
him
how
much
we
meaning
craven
and
son
his
manager
and
his
cashier
and
his
clerks
regretted
the
inconvenience
to
which
he
had
been
put
delicately
i
touched
upon
the
concern
we
felt
at
hearing
of
illness
but
i
added
i
feared
his
explanation
courteous
and
ample
as
it
had
been
would
not
satisfy
miss
blake
and
trusted
he
might
upon
consideration
feel
disposed
to
compromise
the
matter
we
i
added
will
be
only
too
happy
to
recommend
our
client
to
accept
any
reasonable
proposal
you
may
think
it
well
to
make
whereupon
it
suddenly
dawned
upon
the
colonel
that
he
had
been
showing
me
all
his
hand
and
forthwith
he
adopted
a
very
natural
course
he
ordered
me
to
leave
the
room
and
the
hotel
and
not
to
show
my
face
before
him
again
at
my
peril
and
i
obeyed
his
instructions
to
the
letter
on
the
same
evening
of
that
day
i
took
a
long
walk
round
by
the
uninhabited
house
there
it
was
just
as
i
had
seen
it
last
with
high
brick
walls
dividing
it
from
the
road
with
its
belt
of
separating
it
from
the
next
residence
with
its
long
frontage
to
the
river
with
its
closed
gates
and
shuttered
the
entrance
to
it
was
not
from
the
main
highway
but
from
a
lane
which
led
right
down
to
the
thames
and
i
went
to
the
very
bottom
of
that
lane
and
swung
myself
by
means
of
a
post
right
over
the
river
so
that
i
might
get
a
view
of
the
windows
of
the
room
with
which
so
ghostly
a
character
was
associated
the
blinds
were
all
down
and
the
whole
place
looked
innocent
enough
the
strong
sweet
subtle
smell
of
mignonette
came
wafted
to
my
senses
the
odours
of
jessamine
roses
and
myrtle
floated
to
me
on
the
evening
breeze
i
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
radiant
with
colour
full
of
leaf
and
bloom
no
haunted
look
there
i
thought
the
house
is
right
enough
but
some
one
must
have
determined
to
keep
it
empty
and
then
i
swung
myself
back
into
the
lane
again
and
the
shadow
of
the
high
brick
wall
projected
itself
across
my
mind
as
it
did
across
my
body
is
this
place
to
let
again
do
you
know
said
a
voice
in
my
ear
as
i
stood
looking
at
the
private
door
which
gave
a
separate
entrance
to
that
library
the
question
was
a
natural
one
and
the
voice
not
unpleasant
yet
i
started
having
noticed
no
one
near
me
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
owner
of
the
voice
nervous
i
fear
no
not
at
all
only
my
thoughts
were
wandering
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
not
know
whether
the
place
is
to
let
or
not
a
good
house
this
might
have
been
interrogative
or
uttered
as
an
assertion
but
i
took
it
as
the
former
and
answered
accordingly
yes
a
good
house
a
very
good
house
indeed
i
said
it
is
often
vacant
though
he
said
with
a
light
laugh
through
no
fault
of
the
house
i
added
oh
it
is
the
fault
of
the
tenants
is
it
he
remarked
laughing
once
more
the
owners
i
should
think
must
be
rather
tired
of
their
property
by
this
time
i
do
not
know
that
i
replied
they
live
in
hope
of
finding
a
good
and
sensible
tenant
willing
to
take
it
and
equally
willing
to
keep
it
eh
he
remarked
well
i
perhaps
am
not
much
of
a
judge
in
the
matter
but
i
should
say
they
will
have
to
wait
a
long
time
first
you
know
something
about
the
house
i
said
interrogatively
yes
he
answered
most
people
about
here
do
i
fancy
but
least
said
soonest
mended
and
as
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
top
of
the
lane
he
bade
me
a
civil
and
struck
off
in
a
westerly
direction
though
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
shone
full
in
my
face
and
i
had
to
shade
my
eyes
in
order
to
enable
me
to
see
at
all
moved
by
some
feeling
impossible
to
analyse
i
stood
watching
that
retreating
figure
afterwards
i
could
have
sworn
to
the
man
among
ten
thousand
a
man
of
about
fifty
well
and
plainly
dressed
who
did
not
appear
to
be
in
yet
whose
complexion
had
a
blanched
look
like
forced
a
man
of
under
rather
than
over
middle
height
not
of
slight
make
but
lean
as
if
the
flesh
had
been
all
worn
off
his
bones
a
man
with
sad
anxious
outlooking
abstracted
eyes
with
a
nose
slightly
hooked
without
a
trace
of
whisker
with
hair
thin
and
straight
and
flaked
with
white
active
and
lithe
in
his
movements
a
swift
walker
though
he
had
a
slight
halt
while
looking
at
him
thrown
up
in
relief
against
the
glowing
western
sky
i
noticed
what
had
previously
escaped
my
attention
that
he
was
a
little
deformed
his
right
shoulder
was
rather
higher
than
the
other
a
man
with
a
story
in
his
memory
i
imagined
a
man
who
had
been
jilted
by
the
girl
he
loved
or
who
had
lost
her
by
death
or
whose
wife
had
proved
faithless
whose
life
at
all
events
had
been
marred
by
a
great
trouble
so
in
my
folly
i
decided
for
i
was
young
then
and
romantic
and
had
experienced
some
sorrow
myself
connected
with
pecuniary
matters
for
the
latter
reason
it
never
perhaps
occurred
to
me
to
associate
the
trouble
of
my
new
acquaintance
if
he
could
be
so
called
with
money
annoyances
i
knew
or
thought
i
knew
at
all
events
the
expression
loss
of
fortune
stamps
on
a
man
face
and
the
look
which
haunted
me
for
days
after
had
nothing
in
it
of
discontent
or
or
struggling
gentility
or
vehement
protest
against
the
decrees
of
fortune
still
less
was
it
submissive
as
i
have
said
it
haunted
me
for
days
then
the
memory
grew
less
vivid
then
i
forgot
the
man
altogether
indeed
we
shortly
became
so
absorbed
in
the
fight
between
miss
blake
and
colonel
morris
that
we
had
little
time
to
devote
to
the
consideration
of
other
matters
true
to
her
promise
miss
blake
appeared
next
morning
in
buckingham
street
without
bestowing
upon
me
even
the
courtesy
of
good
morning
she
plunged
into
the
subject
next
her
heart
did
you
see
him
she
asked
i
told
her
i
had
i
repeated
much
of
what
he
said
i
assured
her
he
was
determined
to
fight
the
matter
and
that
although
i
did
really
not
think
any
jury
would
give
a
verdict
in
his
favour
still
i
believed
if
the
matter
came
into
court
it
would
prevent
our
ever
letting
the
house
again
i
should
strongly
recommend
you
miss
blake
i
finished
to
keep
what
he
offers
and
let
us
try
and
find
another
tenant
and
who
asked
you
to
recommend
anything
you
fast
young
man
she
demanded
i
am
sure
i
did
not
and
i
am
very
sure
craven
would
not
be
best
pleased
to
know
his
clerks
were
setting
themselves
up
higher
than
their
master
you
would
never
find
william
craven
giving
himself
airs
such
as
you
young
think
make
you
seem
of
some
consequence
i
just
tell
him
what
i
want
done
and
he
does
it
and
you
will
please
to
do
the
same
and
serve
a
writ
on
that
villain
without
an
hour
delay
i
asked
on
what
grounds
we
were
to
serve
the
writ
i
pointed
out
that
colonel
morris
did
not
owe
her
a
penny
and
would
not
owe
her
a
penny
for
some
months
to
come
and
in
reply
she
said
she
would
merely
inquire
if
i
meant
that
she
and
her
poor
niece
were
to
go
to
the
workhouse
to
this
i
answered
that
the
amount
already
remitted
by
colonel
morris
would
prevent
such
a
calamity
but
she
stopped
my
attempt
at
consolation
by
telling
me
not
to
talk
about
things
i
did
not
understand
give
me
william
craven
address
she
added
and
i
will
write
to
him
direct
i
wonder
what
he
means
by
leaving
a
parcel
of
ignorant
boys
to
attend
to
his
clients
while
he
is
away
enjoying
himself
give
me
his
address
and
some
paper
and
an
envelope
and
i
can
write
my
letter
here
i
handed
her
the
paper
and
the
envelope
and
placed
pen
and
ink
conveniently
before
her
but
i
declined
to
give
her
address
we
would
forward
the
letter
i
said
but
when
craven
went
away
for
his
holiday
he
was
naturally
anxious
to
leave
business
behind
as
much
as
possible
then
miss
blake
took
steady
aim
and
fired
at
me
broadside
after
broadside
did
she
pour
into
my
unprotected
ears
she
opened
the
vials
of
her
wrath
and
overwhelmed
me
with
reproaches
she
raked
up
all
the
grievances
she
had
for
years
been
cherishing
against
england
and
by
some
sort
of
verbal
legerdemain
made
me
responsible
for
every
evil
she
could
recollect
as
ever
having
happened
to
her
her
sister
marriage
her
death
elmsdale
suicide
the
unsatisfactory
state
of
his
affairs
the
prejudice
against
river
hall
the
defection
of
colonel
morris
all
these
things
she
laid
at
my
door
and
insisted
on
making
me
responsible
for
them
and
now
she
finished
pushing
back
her
bonnet
and
pulling
off
her
gloves
i
just
write
my
opinion
of
you
to
craven
and
i
wait
till
you
direct
the
envelope
and
i
go
with
you
to
the
post
and
see
you
put
the
letter
in
the
box
if
you
and
your
fine
colonel
morris
think
you
can
frighten
or
flatter
me
you
are
both
much
mistaken
i
can
tell
you
that
i
did
not
answer
her
i
was
too
greatly
affronted
to
express
what
i
felt
in
words
i
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
for
i
would
not
leave
her
alone
in
craven
office
sulking
while
she
wrote
her
letter
which
she
did
in
a
great
fat
splashing
sort
of
hand
with
every
other
word
underlined
and
when
she
had
done
and
tossed
the
missive
over
to
me
i
directed
it
took
my
hat
and
prepared
to
accompany
her
to
the
charing
cross
office
we
went
down
the
staircase
together
in
silence
up
buckingham
street
across
the
strand
and
so
to
charing
cross
where
she
saw
me
drop
the
letter
into
the
box
all
this
time
we
did
not
exchange
a
syllable
but
when
after
raising
my
hat
i
was
about
to
turn
away
she
seized
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
do
let
us
part
in
bad
blood
though
you
are
only
a
clerk
you
have
got
your
feelings
no
doubt
and
if
in
my
temper
i
hurt
them
i
am
sorry
can
i
say
more
you
are
a
decent
lad
enough
as
times
go
in
england
and
my
bark
is
worse
than
my
bite
i
did
write
a
word
about
you
to
william
craven
shake
hands
and
do
bear
malice
to
a
poor
lonely
woman
thus
exhorted
i
took
her
hand
and
shook
it
and
then
in
token
of
entire
amity
she
told
me
she
had
forgotten
to
bring
her
purse
with
her
and
could
i
let
her
have
a
sovereign
she
would
pay
me
she
declared
solemnly
the
first
day
she
came
again
to
the
office
this
of
course
i
did
not
believe
in
the
least
nevertheless
i
gave
her
what
she
required
and
heaven
knows
sovereigns
were
scarce
enough
with
me
then
thankfully
and
felt
sincerely
obliged
to
her
for
making
herself
my
debtor
miss
blake
did
sometimes
ruffle
feathers
most
confoundedly
and
yet
i
knew
it
would
have
grieved
me
had
we
parted
in
enmity
sometimes
now
when
i
look
upon
her
quiet
and
utterly
respectable
old
age
when
i
contemplate
her
pathetic
grey
hair
and
conventional
lace
cap
when
i
view
her
clothed
like
other
people
and
in
her
right
mind
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
remember
i
had
no
second
thought
about
that
sovereign
but
gave
it
to
her
with
all
the
veins
of
my
heart
as
she
would
have
emphasised
the
proceeding
though
you
have
no
name
to
speak
of
observed
miss
blake
as
she
pocketed
the
coin
i
think
there
must
be
some
sort
of
blood
in
you
i
knew
pattersons
once
who
were
connected
by
marriage
with
a
great
duke
in
the
west
of
ireland
can
you
say
if
by
chance
you
can
trace
relationship
to
any
of
them
i
can
say
most
certainly
not
miss
blake
i
replied
we
are
pattersons
of
nowhere
and
relations
of
no
one
well
well
remarked
the
lady
pityingly
you
ca
help
that
poor
lad
and
if
you
attend
to
your
duties
you
may
yet
be
a
rich
city
alderman
with
which
comfort
she
left
me
and
wended
her
homeward
way
through
martin
lane
and
the
seven
dials
the
trial
next
day
but
one
craven
astonished
us
all
by
walking
into
the
office
about
ten
he
looked
stout
and
well
sunburnt
to
a
degree
and
all
the
better
physically
for
his
trip
to
the
seaside
we
were
unfeignedly
glad
to
see
him
given
a
good
employer
and
it
must
be
an
extremely
bad
employé
who
rejoices
in
his
absence
if
we
were
not
saints
we
were
none
of
us
very
black
sheep
and
accordingly
from
the
porter
to
the
managing
clerk
our
faces
brightened
at
sight
of
our
principal
but
after
the
first
genial
how
are
you
and
good
morning
craven
face
told
tales
he
had
come
back
out
of
sorts
he
was
vexed
about
miss
blake
letter
and
astonishing
to
relate
he
was
angry
with
me
for
having
called
upon
colonel
morris
you
take
too
much
upon
you
patterson
he
remarked
it
is
a
growing
habit
with
you
and
you
must
try
to
check
it
i
did
not
answer
him
by
a
word
my
heart
seemed
in
my
mouth
i
felt
as
if
i
was
choking
i
only
inclined
my
head
in
token
that
i
heard
and
understood
and
assented
then
having
fortunately
work
to
attend
to
out
of
doors
i
seized
an
early
opportunity
of
slipping
down
the
staircase
and
walking
off
to
chancery
lane
when
i
returned
after
hours
to
buckingham
street
one
of
the
small
boys
in
the
outer
office
told
me
i
was
to
go
to
craven
room
directly
you
catch
it
remarked
the
young
fiend
he
has
asked
for
you
a
dozen
times
at
least
what
can
be
wrong
now
i
thought
as
i
walked
straight
along
the
passage
to
craven
office
patterson
he
said
as
i
announced
my
return
yes
sir
i
spoke
hastily
to
you
this
morning
and
i
regret
having
done
so
oh
sir
i
cried
and
that
was
all
we
were
better
friends
than
ever
do
you
wonder
that
i
liked
my
principal
if
so
it
is
only
because
i
am
unable
to
portray
him
as
he
really
was
the
age
of
chivalry
is
past
but
still
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
i
would
have
died
cheerfully
if
my
dying
could
have
served
craven
life
holds
me
now
by
many
and
many
a
nearer
and
dearer
tie
than
was
the
case
in
those
days
so
far
and
far
away
nevertheless
i
would
run
any
risk
encounter
any
peril
if
by
so
doing
i
could
serve
the
man
who
in
my
youth
treated
me
with
a
kindness
far
beyond
my
deserts
he
did
not
when
he
came
suddenly
to
town
in
this
manner
stop
at
his
own
house
which
was
on
such
occasions
given
over
to
charwomen
and
tradespeople
of
all
descriptions
but
he
put
up
at
an
family
hotel
where
on
that
especial
evening
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
over
dessert
he
opened
his
mind
to
me
on
the
subject
of
the
uninhabited
house
he
said
the
evil
was
becoming
one
of
serious
magnitude
he
declared
he
could
not
imagine
what
the
result
might
prove
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
he
said
to
assist
miss
blake
and
that
poor
child
i
can
not
undertake
to
provide
for
them
something
must
be
done
in
the
affair
and
i
am
sure
i
can
not
see
what
that
something
is
to
be
since
elmsdale
bought
the
place
the
neighbourhood
has
gone
down
if
we
sold
the
freehold
as
it
stands
i
fear
we
should
not
get
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
for
it
and
a
thousand
pounds
would
not
last
miss
blake
three
years
as
for
supposing
she
could
live
on
the
interest
that
is
out
of
the
question
the
ground
might
be
cut
up
and
let
for
business
purposes
of
course
but
that
would
be
a
work
of
time
i
confess
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
about
the
matter
or
how
to
act
in
it
do
you
suppose
the
place
really
is
haunted
i
ventured
to
inquire
haunted
pooh
nonsense
answered
craven
pettishly
do
i
suppose
this
room
is
haunted
do
i
believe
my
offices
are
haunted
no
sane
man
has
faith
in
any
folly
of
the
kind
but
the
place
has
got
a
bad
name
i
suspect
it
is
unhealthy
and
the
tenants
when
they
find
that
out
seize
on
the
first
excuse
which
offers
it
is
known
we
have
compromised
a
good
many
tenancies
and
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
fight
this
case
if
only
to
show
we
do
not
intend
being
patient
for
ever
besides
we
shall
exhaust
the
matter
we
shall
hear
what
the
have
to
say
for
themselves
on
oath
there
is
little
doubt
of
our
getting
a
verdict
for
the
british
juryman
is
as
a
rule
not
imaginative
i
think
we
shall
get
a
verdict
i
agreed
but
i
fancy
we
shall
never
get
another
tenant
there
are
surely
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
he
answered
with
a
smile
and
we
shall
come
across
some
worthy
country
squire
possessed
of
pretty
daughters
who
will
be
delighted
to
find
so
cheap
and
sweet
a
nest
for
his
birds
when
they
want
to
be
near
london
i
wish
sir
i
said
you
would
see
colonel
morris
yourself
i
am
quite
certain
that
every
statement
he
made
to
me
is
true
in
his
belief
i
do
not
say
i
believe
him
i
only
say
what
he
told
me
justifies
the
inference
that
some
one
is
playing
a
clever
game
in
river
hall
and
then
i
repeated
in
detail
all
the
circumstances
colonel
morris
had
communicated
to
me
not
excepting
the
wonderful
phenomenon
witnessed
by
morris
of
a
man
walking
through
a
closed
door
craven
listened
to
me
in
silence
then
he
said
i
will
not
see
colonel
morris
what
you
tell
me
only
confirms
my
opinion
that
we
must
fight
this
question
if
he
and
his
witnesses
adhere
to
the
story
you
repeat
on
oath
i
shall
then
have
some
tangible
ground
upon
which
to
stand
with
miss
blake
if
they
do
not
and
personally
i
feel
satisfied
no
one
who
told
such
a
tale
could
stand
the
test
of
we
shall
then
have
defeated
the
hidden
enemy
who
as
i
believe
lurks
behind
all
this
miss
blake
is
right
in
what
she
said
to
you
robert
elmsdale
must
have
had
many
a
good
hater
whether
he
ever
inspired
that
different
sort
of
dislike
which
leads
a
man
to
carry
on
a
war
in
secret
and
try
to
injure
this
opponent
family
after
death
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
we
must
test
the
matter
now
patterson
and
i
think
you
had
better
call
upon
colonel
morris
and
tell
him
so
this
service
however
to
craven
intense
astonishment
i
utterly
declined
i
told
him
respectfully
of
course
under
no
possible
conditions
of
life
could
i
have
spoken
other
than
respectfully
to
a
master
i
loved
so
well
that
if
a
message
were
to
be
delivered
from
our
office
it
could
not
be
so
delivered
by
me
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
i
felt
no
desire
to
be
kicked
downstairs
i
declared
that
i
should
consider
it
an
unseemly
thing
for
me
to
engage
in
personal
conflict
with
a
gentleman
of
colonel
morris
years
and
social
position
and
as
a
final
argument
i
stated
solemnly
that
i
believed
no
number
of
interviews
would
change
the
opinions
of
our
late
tenant
or
induce
him
to
alter
his
determination
he
says
he
will
fight
i
remarked
as
a
finish
to
my
speech
and
i
am
confident
he
will
till
he
drops
well
well
said
craven
i
suppose
he
must
do
so
then
but
meantime
it
is
all
very
hard
upon
me
and
indeed
so
it
proved
what
with
miss
blake
who
of
course
required
frequent
advances
to
sustain
her
strength
during
the
approaching
ordeal
what
with
policemen
who
could
not
undertake
to
be
always
river
hall
what
with
watchmen
who
kept
their
vigils
in
the
nearest
as
long
as
it
was
open
and
then
peacefully
returned
home
to
sleep
what
with
possible
tenants
who
came
to
us
imagining
the
place
was
to
let
and
whom
we
referred
to
colonel
morris
who
dismissed
them
each
and
all
with
a
tale
which
disenchanted
them
with
the
desirable
residence
it
was
all
exceeding
hard
upon
craven
and
his
clerks
till
the
quarter
turned
when
we
could
take
action
about
the
matter
before
the
new
year
was
well
commenced
we
were
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
we
had
written
to
colonel
morris
applying
for
one
rent
of
river
hall
a
disreputable
blackguard
of
a
solicitor
would
have
served
him
with
a
writ
but
we
were
eminently
respectable
not
at
the
bidding
of
her
most
gracious
majesty
whose
name
we
invoked
on
many
and
many
of
our
papers
would
craven
have
dispensed
with
the
preliminary
letter
and
i
feel
bound
to
say
i
follow
in
his
footsteps
in
that
respect
to
this
notice
colonel
morris
replied
referring
us
to
his
solicitors
we
wrote
to
them
eliciting
a
reply
to
the
effect
that
they
would
receive
service
of
a
writ
we
served
that
writ
and
then
as
colonel
morris
intended
to
fight
instructed
counsel
meanwhile
the
uninhabited
house
and
the
furniture
it
contained
was
as
taylor
tersely
expressed
the
matter
going
to
the
devil
we
could
not
help
that
however
war
was
put
upon
us
and
go
to
war
we
felt
we
must
which
was
all
extremely
hard
upon
craven
to
my
knowledge
he
had
already
in
three
months
advanced
thirty
pounds
to
miss
blake
besides
allowing
her
to
get
into
his
debt
for
counsel
fees
and
costs
out
of
pocket
and
cab
hire
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
with
a
problematical
result
also
colonel
morris
solicitors
were
sparing
no
expenses
to
crush
us
clearly
they
in
a
blessed
vision
beheld
an
enormous
bill
paid
without
difficulty
or
question
fifty
guineas
here
or
there
did
not
signify
to
their
client
whilst
to
us
well
really
let
a
lawyer
be
as
kind
and
disinterested
as
he
will
fifty
guineas
disbursed
upon
the
suit
of
an
utterly
insolvent
or
persistently
insolvent
client
means
something
eminently
disagreeable
to
him
nevertheless
we
were
all
heartily
glad
to
know
the
day
of
war
was
come
body
and
soul
we
all
went
in
for
miss
blake
and
helena
and
the
uninhabited
house
even
taylor
relented
and
was
to
be
seen
rushing
about
with
papers
in
hand
relating
to
the
impending
suit
of
blake
morris
she
is
a
blank
blank
woman
he
remarked
to
me
but
still
the
case
is
interesting
i
do
think
ghosts
have
ever
before
come
into
court
in
my
experience
and
we
were
all
of
the
same
mind
we
girt
up
our
loins
for
the
fight
each
of
us
i
think
on
the
strength
of
her
celebrity
lent
miss
blake
a
few
shillings
and
one
or
two
of
our
number
franked
her
to
luncheon
she
patronized
us
all
i
know
and
said
she
should
like
to
tell
our
mothers
they
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
their
sons
and
then
came
a
dreadfully
solemn
morning
when
we
went
to
westminster
and
championed
miss
blake
never
in
our
memory
of
the
lady
had
she
appeared
to
such
advantage
as
when
we
met
her
in
edward
the
confessor
hall
she
looked
a
little
paler
than
usual
and
we
felt
her
general
was
a
credit
to
our
establishment
she
wore
an
immense
fur
tippet
which
though
then
of
an
obsolete
fashion
made
her
look
like
a
annuitant
going
to
receive
her
dividends
her
throat
was
covered
with
a
fine
white
lawn
handkerchief
her
dress
was
mercifully
long
enough
to
conceal
her
boots
her
bonnet
was
perfectly
straight
and
the
strings
tied
by
some
one
who
understood
that
bows
should
be
pulled
out
and
otherwise
fancifully
manipulated
as
she
carried
a
muff
as
large
as
a
big
drum
she
had
conceived
the
happy
idea
of
dispensing
altogether
with
gloves
and
i
saw
that
one
of
the
fingers
she
gave
me
to
shake
was
adorned
with
a
diamond
ring
miss
elmsdale
whispered
taylor
to
me
it
belonged
to
her
mother
hearing
which
i
understood
helena
had
superintended
her
aunt
toilet
did
you
ever
see
miss
elmsdale
i
inquired
of
our
manager
not
for
years
was
the
answer
she
bade
fair
to
be
pretty
why
does
not
miss
blake
bring
her
out
with
her
sometimes
i
asked
i
believe
she
is
expecting
the
queen
to
give
her
assent
to
her
marrying
the
prince
of
wales
explained
taylor
and
she
does
not
wish
her
to
appear
much
in
public
until
after
the
wedding
the
court
was
crammed
somehow
it
had
got
into
the
papers
probably
through
colonel
morris
gossips
at
the
club
that
ours
was
likely
to
prove
a
very
interesting
case
and
though
the
morning
was
damp
and
wretched
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
turned
out
into
the
fog
and
drizzle
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
will
when
there
seems
the
least
chance
of
a
new
sensation
being
provided
for
them
further
there
were
lots
of
reporters
it
will
be
in
every
paper
throughout
the
kingdom
groaned
taylor
we
had
better
by
far
have
left
the
colonel
alone
that
had
always
been
my
opinion
but
i
only
said
well
it
is
of
no
use
looking
back
now
i
glanced
at
craven
and
saw
he
was
ill
at
ease
we
had
considerable
faith
in
ourselves
our
case
and
our
counsel
but
then
we
could
not
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
colonel
morris
counsel
were
men
very
much
better
known
than
our
men
that
a
cloud
of
witnesses
thirsting
to
avenge
themselves
for
the
rent
we
had
compelled
them
to
pay
for
an
uninhabitable
house
were
hovering
about
the
court
had
we
not
seen
and
recognized
them
in
the
hall
that
in
fact
there
were
two
very
distinct
sides
to
the
question
one
represented
by
colonel
morris
and
his
party
and
the
other
by
miss
blake
and
ourselves
of
course
our
case
lay
in
a
nutshell
we
had
let
the
place
and
colonel
morris
had
agreed
to
take
it
colonel
morris
now
wanted
to
be
rid
of
his
bargain
and
we
were
determined
to
keep
him
to
it
colonel
morris
said
the
house
was
haunted
and
that
no
one
could
live
in
it
we
said
the
house
was
not
haunted
and
that
anybody
could
live
in
it
that
river
hall
was
in
every
respect
suited
for
the
residence
of
a
family
of
position
see
advertisements
in
and
now
if
the
reader
will
kindly
consider
the
matter
it
must
be
an
extremely
difficult
thing
to
prove
in
a
court
of
law
that
a
house
by
reason
solely
of
being
haunted
is
unsuitable
for
the
residence
of
a
gentleman
of
position
smells
bad
drainage
impure
water
unhealthiness
of
situation
dampness
the
absence
of
advantages
mentioned
the
presence
of
small
game
more
odious
to
tenants
of
furnished
houses
than
ground
game
to
farmers
all
these
things
had
we
knew
been
made
pretexts
for
repudiation
of
contracts
and
often
successfully
but
we
could
find
no
precedent
for
ghosts
being
held
as
just
pleas
upon
which
to
relinquish
a
tenancy
and
we
made
sure
of
a
favourable
verdict
accordingly
to
this
day
i
believe
that
our
hopes
would
have
been
justified
by
the
result
had
some
demon
of
mischief
not
put
it
into
the
head
of
taylor
who
had
the
management
of
the
case
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
get
miss
blake
into
the
she
will
amuse
the
jury
he
said
and
juries
have
always
a
kindly
feeling
for
any
person
who
can
amuse
them
which
was
all
very
well
and
might
be
very
true
in
a
general
way
but
miss
blake
proved
the
exception
to
his
rule
of
course
she
amused
the
jury
in
fact
she
amused
everyone
to
get
her
to
give
a
straightforward
answer
to
any
question
was
simply
impossible
over
and
over
again
the
judge
explained
to
her
that
yes
or
no
would
be
amply
sufficient
but
all
in
vain
she
launched
out
at
large
in
reply
to
our
counsel
who
nevertheless
when
he
sat
down
had
gained
his
point
miss
blake
declared
upon
oath
she
had
never
seen
anything
worse
than
herself
at
river
hall
and
did
not
believe
anybody
else
ever
had
she
had
never
been
there
during
colonel
morris
tenancy
or
she
must
certainly
have
seen
something
worse
than
a
ghost
a
man
ready
and
anxious
to
rob
the
orphan
and
she
was
going
to
add
the
widow
when
peals
of
laughter
stopped
her
utterance
miss
blake
had
no
faith
in
ghosts
resident
at
river
hall
and
if
anybody
was
playing
tricks
about
the
house
she
should
have
thought
a
fighting
gentleman
by
profession
capable
of
getting
rid
of
them
unless
he
was
afraid
added
miss
blake
with
withering
irony
then
up
rose
the
opposition
counsel
who
approached
her
in
an
easy
conversational
manner
and
so
you
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
miss
blake
he
began
indeed
and
i
do
she
answered
but
if
we
have
not
ghosts
what
is
to
become
of
the
literature
of
your
country
he
inquired
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
talking
about
my
country
said
miss
blake
who
was
always
proclaiming
her
nationality
and
quarrelling
with
those
who
discovered
it
without
such
proclamation
i
mean
he
explained
that
all
the
fanciful
legends
and
beautiful
stories
for
which
ireland
is
celebrated
have
their
origin
in
the
supernatural
there
are
for
instance
several
old
families
who
have
their
traditional
banshee
for
that
matter
we
have
one
ourselves
agreed
miss
blake
with
conscious
pride
at
this
junction
our
counsel
interposed
with
a
suggestion
that
there
was
no
insinuation
about
any
banshee
residing
at
river
hall
no
the
question
is
about
a
ghost
and
i
am
coming
to
that
different
countries
have
different
usages
in
ireland
as
miss
blake
admits
there
exists
a
very
ladylike
spirit
who
announces
the
coming
death
of
any
member
of
certain
families
in
england
we
have
ghosts
who
appear
after
the
death
of
some
members
of
some
families
now
miss
blake
i
want
you
to
exercise
your
memory
do
you
remember
a
night
in
the
november
after
elmsdale
death
i
remember
many
nights
in
many
months
that
i
passed
in
that
house
she
answered
composedly
but
she
grew
very
pale
and
feeling
there
was
something
unexpected
behind
both
question
and
answer
our
counsel
looked
at
us
and
we
looked
back
at
him
dismayed
your
niece
being
nervous
slept
in
the
same
room
as
that
occupied
by
you
continued
the
learned
gentleman
she
did
said
miss
blake
her
answer
was
short
enough
and
direct
enough
at
last
now
on
the
particular
november
night
to
which
i
refer
do
you
recollect
being
awakened
by
miss
elmsdale
she
wakened
me
many
a
time
answered
miss
blake
and
i
noticed
that
she
looked
away
from
her
questioner
and
towards
the
gallery
exactly
so
but
on
one
especial
night
she
woke
you
saying
her
father
was
walking
along
the
passage
that
she
knew
his
step
and
that
she
heard
his
keys
strike
against
the
wall
yes
i
remember
that
said
miss
blake
with
suspicious
alacrity
she
kept
me
up
till
daybreak
she
was
always
thinking
about
him
poor
child
very
natural
indeed
commented
our
adversary
and
you
told
her
not
to
be
foolish
i
daresay
and
very
probably
tried
to
reassure
her
by
saying
one
of
the
servants
must
have
passed
and
no
doubt
being
a
lady
possessed
of
energy
and
courage
you
opened
your
bedroom
door
and
looked
up
and
down
the
corridor
certainly
i
did
agreed
miss
blake
and
saw
nothing
and
no
one
i
saw
nothing
and
then
possibly
in
order
to
convince
miss
elmsdale
of
the
full
extent
of
her
delusion
you
lit
a
candle
and
went
downstairs
of
course
why
would
i
said
miss
blake
defiantly
why
not
indeed
repeated
the
learned
gentleman
pensively
why
not
miss
blake
being
brave
as
she
is
witty
well
you
went
downstairs
and
as
was
the
admirable
custom
of
the
house
a
custom
worthy
of
all
commendation
you
found
the
doors
opening
from
the
hall
bolted
and
locked
i
did
and
no
sign
of
a
human
being
about
except
myself
supplemented
miss
blake
and
rather
wishing
to
find
that
some
human
being
besides
yourself
was
about
you
retraced
your
steps
and
visited
the
servants
apartments
you
might
have
been
with
me
said
miss
blake
with
an
angry
sneer
i
wish
i
had
he
answered
i
can
never
sufficiently
deplore
the
fact
of
my
absence
and
you
found
the
servants
asleep
well
they
seemed
asleep
said
the
lady
but
that
does
not
prove
that
they
were
so
doubtless
he
agreed
nevertheless
so
far
as
you
could
judge
none
of
them
looked
as
if
they
had
been
wandering
up
and
down
the
corridors
i
could
not
judge
one
way
or
another
said
miss
blake
for
the
tricks
of
english
servants
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
be
up
to
still
it
did
not
occur
to
you
at
the
time
that
any
of
them
was
feigning
slumber
i
ca
say
it
did
you
see
i
am
naturally
unsuspicious
explained
miss
blake
naively
precisely
so
and
thus
it
happened
that
you
were
unable
to
confute
miss
elmsdale
fancy
i
told
her
she
must
have
been
dreaming
retorted
miss
blake
people
who
wake
all
of
a
sudden
often
confound
dreams
with
realities
and
people
who
are
not
in
the
habit
of
awaking
suddenly
often
do
the
same
thing
agreed
her
questioner
and
so
miss
blake
we
will
pass
out
of
dreamland
and
into
daylight
or
rather
foglight
do
you
recollect
a
particularly
foggy
day
when
your
niece
hearing
a
favourite
dog
moaning
piteously
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
her
father
died
in
order
to
let
it
out
miss
blake
set
her
lips
tight
and
looked
up
at
the
gallery
there
was
a
little
stir
in
that
part
of
the
court
a
shuffling
of
feet
and
suppressed
whispering
in
vain
the
crier
shouted
silence
silence
there
the
bustle
continued
for
about
a
minute
and
then
all
became
quiet
again
a
policeman
stated
a
female
had
fainted
and
our
curiosity
being
satisfied
we
all
with
one
accord
turned
towards
our
learned
friend
who
one
hand
under
his
gown
holding
it
back
and
the
other
raised
to
emphasise
his
question
had
stood
in
this
picturesque
attitude
during
the
time
occupied
in
carrying
the
female
out
as
if
done
in
stone
miss
blake
will
you
kindly
answer
my
question
he
said
when
order
once
again
reigned
in
court
you
worse
than
a
heathen
remarked
the
lady
irrelevantly
i
am
sorry
you
do
not
like
me
he
replied
for
i
admire
you
very
much
but
my
imperfections
are
beside
the
matter
in
point
what
i
want
you
to
tell
us
is
did
miss
elmsdale
open
that
door
she
did
the
creature
she
did
was
the
answer
her
heart
was
always
tender
to
dumb
brutes
i
have
no
doubt
the
young
lady
heart
was
everything
it
ought
to
be
was
the
reply
and
for
that
reason
though
she
had
an
intense
repugnance
to
enter
the
room
she
opened
the
door
to
let
the
dog
out
she
said
so
i
was
not
there
answered
miss
blake
whereupon
ensued
a
brisk
skirmish
between
counsel
as
to
whether
miss
blake
could
give
evidence
about
a
matter
of
mere
hearsay
and
after
they
had
fought
for
ten
minutes
over
the
legal
bone
our
adversary
said
he
would
put
the
question
differently
which
he
did
thus
you
were
sitting
in
the
when
you
were
startled
by
hearing
a
piercing
shriek
i
heard
a
screech
you
can
call
it
what
you
like
said
miss
blake
feeling
an
utter
contempt
for
english
phraseology
i
stand
corrected
thank
you
miss
blake
you
heard
a
screech
in
short
and
you
hurried
across
the
hall
and
found
miss
elmsdale
in
a
fainting
condition
on
the
floor
of
the
library
was
that
so
she
often
fainted
she
is
all
nairves
explained
poor
miss
blake
no
doubt
and
when
she
regained
consciousness
she
entreated
to
be
taken
out
of
that
dreadful
room
she
never
liked
the
room
after
her
father
death
it
was
natural
poor
child
quite
natural
and
so
you
took
her
into
the
and
there
curled
upon
the
hearthrug
fast
asleep
was
the
little
dog
she
fancied
she
heard
whining
in
the
library
yes
he
had
been
away
for
two
or
three
days
and
came
home
hungry
and
sleepy
exactly
and
you
have
therefore
no
reason
to
believe
he
was
shamming
slumber
i
believe
i
am
getting
very
tired
of
your
questions
and
she
said
irritably
now
what
a
pity
remarked
her
tormentor
for
i
could
never
tire
of
your
answers
at
all
events
miss
elmsdale
could
not
have
heard
him
whining
in
the
library
so
called
she
might
have
heard
some
other
dog
said
miss
blake
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
she
stated
to
you
there
was
no
dog
in
the
room
she
did
but
i
do
think
she
knew
whether
there
was
or
not
in
any
case
she
did
not
see
a
dog
you
did
not
see
one
and
the
servants
did
not
i
did
not
replied
miss
blake
as
to
the
servants
i
would
not
believe
them
on
their
oath
hush
hush
miss
blake
entreated
our
opponent
i
am
afraid
you
must
not
be
quite
so
frank
now
to
return
to
business
when
miss
elmsdale
recovered
consciousness
which
she
did
in
that
very
comfortable
in
the
what
did
she
tell
you
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
repeat
her
words
demanded
miss
blake
angrily
poor
dear
she
was
out
of
her
mind
half
the
time
after
her
father
death
no
doubt
but
still
i
must
just
ask
you
to
tell
us
what
passed
was
it
anything
like
this
did
she
say
have
seen
my
father
he
was
coming
out
of
the
when
i
lifted
my
head
after
looking
for
juan
and
he
was
wringing
his
hands
and
seemed
in
some
terrible
distress
god
forgive
them
that
told
you
her
words
remarked
miss
blake
but
she
did
say
just
those
and
i
hope
they
do
you
and
her
as
played
eavesdropper
all
the
good
i
wish
really
miss
blake
interposed
the
judge
i
have
no
more
questions
to
ask
my
lord
said
colonel
counsel
serenely
triumphant
miss
blake
can
go
down
now
and
miss
blake
did
go
down
and
taylor
whispered
in
my
ear
she
had
done
for
us
we
agree
to
compromise
colonel
morris
side
of
the
case
was
now
to
be
heard
and
heads
were
bending
eagerly
forward
to
catch
each
word
of
wisdom
that
should
fall
from
the
lips
of
serjeant
playfire
when
i
felt
a
hand
cold
as
ice
laid
on
mine
and
turning
beheld
miss
blake
at
my
elbow
she
was
as
white
as
the
nature
of
her
complexion
would
permit
and
her
voice
shook
as
she
whispered
take
me
away
from
this
place
will
you
i
cleared
a
way
for
her
out
of
the
court
and
when
we
reached
westminster
hall
seeing
how
upset
she
seemed
asked
if
i
could
get
anything
for
her
a
glass
of
water
or
wine
i
suggested
in
my
extremity
neither
water
nor
wine
will
mend
a
broken
heart
she
answered
solemnly
and
mine
has
been
broken
in
there
with
a
nod
she
indicated
the
court
we
had
just
left
not
remembering
at
the
moment
an
approved
recipe
for
the
cure
of
such
a
fracture
i
was
cudgelling
my
brains
to
think
of
some
form
of
reply
not
likely
to
give
offence
when
to
my
unspeakable
relief
craven
came
up
to
where
we
stood
i
will
take
charge
of
miss
blake
now
patterson
he
said
gravely
very
gravely
and
accepting
this
as
an
intimation
that
he
desired
my
absence
i
was
turning
away
when
i
heard
miss
blake
say
where
is
she
the
creature
what
have
they
done
with
her
at
all
i
have
sent
her
home
was
craven
reply
how
could
you
be
so
foolish
as
to
mislead
me
as
you
have
done
come
thought
i
smelling
the
battle
afar
off
we
shall
soon
have
craven
blake
tried
privately
in
our
office
i
knew
craven
pretty
well
and
understood
he
would
not
readily
forgive
miss
blake
for
having
kept
miss
helena
experiences
a
secret
from
him
over
and
over
i
had
heard
miss
blake
state
there
was
not
a
thing
really
against
the
house
and
that
helena
poor
dear
only
hated
the
place
because
she
had
there
lost
her
father
not
much
of
a
loss
either
if
she
could
be
brought
to
think
so
finished
miss
blake
sometimes
consequently
to
craven
as
well
as
to
all
the
rest
of
those
connected
with
the
firm
the
facts
elicited
by
serjeant
playfire
were
new
as
unwelcome
if
the
daughter
of
the
house
dreamed
dreams
and
beheld
visions
why
should
strangers
be
denied
a
like
privilege
if
miss
elmsdale
believed
her
father
could
not
rest
in
his
grave
how
were
we
to
compel
belief
as
to
calm
repose
on
the
part
of
yearly
tenants
playfire
has
been
pitching
into
us
pretty
strong
remarked
taylor
when
i
at
length
elbowed
my
way
back
to
where
our
manager
sat
where
is
mr
craven
i
left
him
with
miss
blake
it
is
just
as
well
he
has
not
heard
all
the
civil
remarks
playfire
made
about
our
connection
with
the
business
hush
he
is
going
to
call
his
witnesses
no
the
court
is
about
to
adjourn
for
luncheon
once
again
i
went
out
into
westminster
hall
and
was
sauntering
idly
up
and
down
over
its
stones
when
craven
joined
me
a
bad
business
this
patterson
he
remarked
we
shall
never
get
another
tenant
for
that
house
i
answered
certainly
no
tenant
will
ever
again
be
got
through
me
he
said
irritably
and
then
taylor
came
to
him
all
in
a
hurry
and
explaining
he
was
wanted
carried
him
away
they
are
going
to
compromise
i
thought
and
followed
slowly
in
the
direction
taken
by
my
principal
how
i
knew
they
were
thinking
of
anything
of
the
kind
i
can
not
say
but
intuitively
i
understood
the
course
events
were
taking
our
counsel
had
mentally
decided
that
although
the
jury
might
feel
inclined
to
uphold
contracts
and
to
repudiate
ghosts
still
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
overlook
the
fact
that
colonel
morris
had
rented
the
place
in
utter
ignorance
of
its
antecedents
and
that
we
had
so
far
taken
a
perhaps
undue
advantage
of
him
moreover
the
gallant
officer
had
witnesses
in
court
able
to
prove
and
desirous
of
proving
that
we
had
over
and
over
again
compromised
matters
with
dissatisfied
tenants
and
cancelled
agreements
not
once
or
twice
but
many
times
further
on
no
single
occasion
had
miss
blake
and
her
niece
ever
slept
a
single
night
in
the
uninhabited
house
from
the
day
when
they
left
it
no
matter
how
scarce
of
money
they
chanced
to
be
they
went
into
lodgings
rather
than
reside
at
river
hall
this
was
beyond
dispute
and
miss
blake
evidence
supplied
the
reason
for
conduct
so
extraordinary
for
some
reason
the
house
was
uninhabitable
the
very
owners
could
not
live
in
it
and
yet
so
in
imagination
we
heard
serjeant
playfire
declaim
the
lady
from
whom
the
truth
had
that
day
been
reluctantly
wrung
had
the
audacity
to
insist
that
delicate
women
and
tender
children
should
continue
to
inhabit
a
dwelling
over
which
a
curse
seemed
brooding
a
dwelling
where
the
dead
were
always
striving
for
mastery
with
the
living
or
else
pay
miss
blake
a
sum
of
money
which
should
enable
her
and
the
daughter
of
the
suicide
to
live
in
ease
and
luxury
on
the
profits
of
deception
and
looking
at
the
matter
candidly
our
counsel
did
not
believe
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict
he
felt
satisfied
he
said
there
was
not
a
landlord
in
the
box
that
they
were
all
tenants
who
would
consider
the
three
months
rent
paid
over
and
above
the
actual
occupation
rent
ample
and
more
than
ample
remuneration
on
the
other
hand
serjeant
playfire
whose
experience
of
juries
was
large
and
calculated
to
make
him
feel
some
contempt
for
the
judgment
of
twelve
honest
men
in
any
case
from
to
manslaughter
had
a
prevision
that
when
the
judge
had
explained
to
foreman
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
nature
of
a
contract
and
told
them
supernatural
appearances
however
disagreeable
were
not
recognized
in
law
as
a
sufficient
cause
for
breaking
an
agreement
a
verdict
would
be
found
for
miss
blake
there
must
be
one
landlord
amongst
them
he
considered
and
if
there
is
he
will
wind
the
rest
round
his
finger
besides
they
will
take
the
side
of
the
women
naturally
and
miss
blake
made
them
laugh
and
the
way
she
spoke
of
her
niece
touched
them
while
as
for
the
colonel
he
wo
like
and
i
can
see
my
learned
friend
means
to
make
him
appear
ridiculous
enough
has
been
done
for
honour
let
us
think
of
safety
for
my
part
said
colonel
morris
when
the
question
was
referred
to
him
i
am
not
a
vindictive
man
nor
i
hope
an
ungenerous
foe
i
do
not
like
to
be
victimized
and
i
have
vindicated
my
principles
the
victory
was
mine
in
fact
if
not
in
law
when
that
old
confession
was
wrung
out
of
her
so
therefore
gentlemen
settle
the
matter
as
you
please
i
shall
be
satisfied
and
all
the
time
he
was
inwardly
praying
some
arrangement
might
be
come
to
he
was
brave
enough
in
his
own
way
but
it
is
one
thing
to
go
into
battle
and
another
to
stand
legal
fire
without
the
chance
of
sending
a
single
bullet
in
return
ridicule
is
the
vulnerable
spot
in
the
heel
of
many
a
modern
achilles
and
while
the
rest
of
the
court
was
convulsed
with
laughter
over
miss
blake
the
gallant
colonel
felt
himself
alternately
turning
hot
and
cold
when
he
thought
that
through
even
such
an
ordeal
he
might
have
to
pass
and
accordingly
to
cut
short
this
part
of
my
story
amongst
them
the
lawyers
agreed
to
compromise
the
matter
thus
colonel
morris
to
give
miss
blake
a
third
quarter
rent
in
other
words
fifty
pounds
more
and
each
side
to
pay
its
own
costs
when
this
decision
was
finally
arrived
at
craven
face
was
a
study
full
well
he
knew
on
whom
would
fall
the
costs
of
one
side
he
saw
in
prophetic
vision
the
fifty
pounds
passing
out
of
his
hands
into
those
of
miss
blake
but
no
revelation
was
vouchsafed
on
the
subject
of
loans
unpaid
of
costs
out
of
pocket
or
costs
at
all
after
we
left
court
he
employed
himself
i
fancy
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
in
making
mental
calculations
of
how
much
poorer
a
man
memory
and
the
uninhabited
house
had
left
him
and
upon
the
whole
the
arithmetical
problem
could
not
have
proved
satisfactory
when
solved
the
judge
complimented
everyone
upon
the
compromise
effected
it
was
honourable
in
every
way
and
creditable
to
all
parties
concerned
but
the
jury
evidently
were
somewhat
dissatisfied
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
while
the
witnesses
were
like
to
rend
colonel
morris
asunder
they
had
come
at
great
inconvenience
to
themselves
to
expose
the
tactics
of
that
blake
woman
and
her
solicitor
so
they
said
and
they
thought
the
affair
ought
not
to
have
been
hushed
up
as
for
the
audience
they
murmured
openly
they
received
the
statement
that
the
case
was
over
with
groans
hisses
and
other
marks
of
disapproval
and
we
heard
comments
on
the
matter
uttered
by
disappointed
spectators
all
the
way
up
parliament
street
till
we
arrived
at
that
point
where
we
left
the
main
thoroughfare
in
order
to
strike
across
to
buckingham
street
there
where
pepys
once
lived
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
books
and
papers
with
a
sense
of
unusual
depression
in
the
atmosphere
it
was
a
gray
dull
cheerless
afternoon
and
more
than
one
of
us
looking
out
at
the
mud
bank
which
at
low
water
then
occupied
the
space
now
laid
out
as
gardens
wondered
how
river
hall
desolate
tenantless
uninhabited
looked
under
that
sullen
sky
with
the
murky
river
flowing
onward
day
and
night
day
and
night
leaving
unheeding
an
unsolved
mystery
on
its
banks
for
a
week
we
saw
nothing
of
miss
blake
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
in
consequence
of
a
somewhat
imperative
summons
from
craven
she
called
at
the
office
late
one
afternoon
we
comprehended
she
had
selected
that
for
her
unusual
time
of
day
for
a
visit
hoping
our
principal
might
have
left
ere
she
arrived
but
in
this
hope
she
was
disappointed
craven
was
in
at
leisure
and
anxious
to
see
her
i
shall
never
forget
that
interview
miss
blake
arrived
about
five
when
it
was
quite
dark
out
of
doors
and
when
in
all
our
offices
except
craven
the
gas
was
flaring
away
triumphantly
in
his
apartment
he
kept
the
light
always
subdued
but
between
the
fire
and
the
lamp
there
was
plenty
of
light
to
see
that
miss
blake
looked
ill
and
depressed
and
that
craven
had
assumed
a
peculiar
expression
which
to
those
who
knew
him
best
implied
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
pursue
a
particular
course
of
action
and
meant
to
adhere
to
his
determination
you
wanted
to
see
me
said
our
client
breaking
the
ice
yes
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
our
connection
with
the
river
hall
property
must
be
considered
at
an
end
well
well
that
is
the
way
of
men
i
suppose
in
england
i
do
not
think
any
man
whether
in
england
or
ireland
could
have
done
more
for
a
client
than
i
have
tried
to
do
for
you
miss
blake
was
the
offended
answer
i
am
sure
i
have
never
found
fault
with
you
remarked
miss
blake
deprecatingly
and
i
do
not
think
continued
craven
unheeding
her
remark
any
lawyer
ever
met
with
a
worse
return
for
all
his
trouble
than
i
have
received
from
you
dear
dear
said
miss
blake
with
comic
disbelief
in
her
tone
that
is
very
bad
there
are
two
classes
of
men
who
ought
to
be
treated
with
entire
confidence
persisted
craven
lawyers
and
doctors
it
is
as
foolish
to
keep
back
anything
from
one
as
from
another
i
daresay
argued
miss
blake
but
we
are
not
all
wise
alike
you
know
no
remarked
my
principal
who
was
indeed
no
match
for
the
lady
or
you
would
never
have
allowed
me
to
take
your
case
into
court
in
ignorance
of
helena
having
seen
her
father
come
come
retorted
miss
blake
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
believe
she
ever
did
see
her
father
since
he
was
buried
and
had
the
put
all
right
and
neat
again
about
him
and
indeed
it
went
to
my
heart
to
have
a
man
who
had
fallen
into
such
bad
ways
laid
in
the
same
grave
with
my
dear
sister
but
i
thought
it
would
be
unchristian
we
need
not
go
over
all
that
ground
once
more
surely
interrupted
craven
i
have
heard
your
opinions
concerning
elmsdale
frequently
expressed
ere
now
that
which
i
never
did
hear
however
until
it
proved
too
late
was
the
fact
of
helena
having
fancied
she
saw
her
father
after
his
death
and
what
good
would
it
have
done
you
if
i
had
repeated
all
the
foolish
notions
this
that
i
should
not
have
tried
to
let
a
house
believed
by
the
owner
herself
to
be
uninhabitable
and
so
you
would
have
kept
us
without
bread
to
put
in
our
mouths
or
a
roof
over
our
heads
i
should
have
asked
you
to
do
at
first
what
i
must
ask
you
to
do
at
last
if
you
decline
to
sell
the
place
or
let
it
unfurnished
on
a
long
lease
to
some
one
willing
to
take
it
spite
of
its
bad
character
i
must
say
the
house
will
never
again
be
let
through
my
instrumentality
and
i
must
beg
you
to
advertise
river
hall
yourself
or
place
it
in
the
hands
of
an
agent
do
you
mean
to
say
william
craven
asked
miss
blake
solemnly
that
you
believe
that
house
to
be
haunted
i
do
not
he
answered
i
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
but
i
believe
the
place
has
somehow
got
a
bad
name
perhaps
through
helena
fancies
and
that
people
imagine
it
is
haunted
and
get
frightened
probably
at
sight
of
their
own
shadows
come
miss
blake
i
see
a
way
out
of
this
difficulty
you
go
and
take
up
your
abode
at
river
hall
for
six
months
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
evil
charm
will
be
broken
and
helena
dead
she
observed
you
need
not
take
helena
with
you
nor
anybody
else
i
suppose
you
mean
she
remarked
thank
you
craven
but
though
my
life
is
none
too
happy
i
should
like
to
die
a
natural
death
and
god
only
knows
whether
those
who
have
been
peeping
and
spying
about
the
place
might
not
murder
me
in
my
bed
if
i
ever
went
to
bed
in
the
house
that
is
then
in
a
word
you
do
believe
the
place
is
haunted
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
she
answered
angrily
but
though
i
have
courage
enough
thank
heaven
i
should
not
like
to
stay
all
alone
in
any
house
and
i
know
there
is
not
a
servant
in
england
would
stay
there
with
me
unless
she
meant
to
take
my
life
but
i
tell
you
what
william
craven
there
are
lots
of
poor
creatures
in
the
world
even
poorer
than
we
are
tutors
and
starved
curates
and
the
like
get
one
of
them
to
stay
at
the
hall
till
he
finds
out
where
the
trick
is
and
i
wo
mind
saying
he
shall
have
fifty
pounds
down
for
his
pains
that
is
i
mean
of
course
when
he
has
discovered
the
secret
of
all
these
strange
lights
and
suchlike
and
feeling
she
had
by
this
proposition
struck
craven
under
the
fifth
rib
miss
blake
rose
to
depart
you
will
kindly
think
over
what
i
have
said
observed
craven
i
do
that
if
you
will
kindly
think
over
what
i
have
said
she
retorted
with
the
utmost
composure
and
then
after
a
curt
she
passed
through
the
door
i
held
open
nodding
to
me
as
though
she
would
have
remarked
i
more
than
a
match
for
your
master
still
young
man
what
a
woman
that
is
exclaimed
craven
as
i
resumed
my
seat
do
you
think
she
really
means
what
she
says
about
the
fifty
pounds
i
inquired
i
do
not
know
he
answered
but
i
know
i
would
cheerfully
pay
that
sum
to
anyone
who
could
unravel
the
mystery
of
river
hall
are
you
in
earnest
sir
i
asked
in
some
surprise
certainly
i
am
he
replied
then
let
me
go
and
stay
at
river
hall
i
said
i
will
undertake
to
run
the
ghost
to
earth
for
half
the
money
my
own
story
it
is
necessary
now
that
i
should
tell
the
readers
something
about
my
own
antecedents
aware
of
how
uninteresting
the
subject
must
prove
i
shall
make
that
something
as
short
as
possible
already
it
will
have
been
clearly
understood
both
from
my
own
hints
and
from
miss
blake
far
from
reticent
remarks
on
my
position
that
i
was
a
clerk
at
a
salary
in
craven
office
but
this
had
not
always
been
the
case
when
i
went
first
to
buckingham
street
i
was
duly
articled
to
craven
and
my
mother
and
sister
who
were
of
aspiring
dispositions
lamented
that
my
choice
of
a
profession
had
fallen
on
law
rather
than
soldiering
they
would
have
been
proud
of
a
young
fellow
in
uniform
but
they
did
not
feel
at
all
elated
at
the
idea
of
being
so
closely
connected
with
a
musty
attorney
as
for
my
father
he
told
me
to
make
my
own
choice
and
found
the
money
to
enable
me
to
do
so
he
was
an
soul
who
was
in
the
miserable
position
of
having
a
sufficient
income
to
live
on
without
exerting
either
mind
or
body
and
yet
whose
income
was
insufficient
to
enable
him
to
have
superior
hobbies
or
to
gratify
any
particular
taste
we
resided
in
the
country
and
belonged
to
the
middle
class
of
comfortable
english
people
in
our
way
we
were
somewhat
exclusive
as
to
our
associates
and
as
the
hall
and
castle
residents
were
in
their
way
exclusive
also
we
lived
almost
out
of
society
indeed
we
were
very
intimate
with
only
one
family
in
our
neighbourhood
and
i
think
it
was
the
example
of
the
son
of
that
house
which
first
induced
me
to
think
of
leading
a
different
existence
from
that
in
which
my
father
had
grown
as
green
and
mossy
as
a
felled
tree
ned
munro
the
eldest
hope
of
a
proud
but
reduced
stock
elected
to
study
for
the
medical
profession
the
life
here
he
remarked
vaguely
indicating
the
distant
houses
occupied
by
our
respective
sires
may
suit
the
old
folks
but
it
does
not
suit
me
and
he
went
out
into
the
wilderness
of
the
world
after
his
departure
i
found
that
the
life
at
home
did
not
suit
me
either
and
so
i
followed
his
lead
and
went
duly
articled
to
craven
of
buckingham
street
strand
craven
and
my
father
were
old
friends
to
this
hour
i
thank
heaven
for
giving
my
father
such
a
friend
after
i
had
been
for
a
considerable
time
with
craven
there
came
a
dreadful
day
when
tidings
arrived
that
my
father
was
ruined
and
my
immediate
presence
required
at
home
what
followed
was
that
which
is
usual
enough
in
all
such
cases
with
this
difference
the
loss
of
his
fortune
killed
my
father
from
what
i
have
seen
since
i
believe
when
he
took
to
his
bed
and
quietly
gave
up
living
altogether
he
did
the
wisest
and
best
thing
possible
under
the
circumstances
dear
simple
kindly
old
man
i
can
not
fancy
how
his
feeble
nature
might
have
endured
the
years
which
followed
filled
by
my
mother
and
sister
with
lamentations
though
we
knew
no
actual
want
thanks
to
craven
my
father
had
been
dabbling
in
shares
and
when
the
natural
consequence
ruin
utter
ruin
came
to
our
pretty
country
home
craven
returned
me
the
money
paid
to
him
and
offered
me
a
salary
think
of
what
this
kindness
was
and
we
penniless
while
all
the
time
relations
stood
aloof
holding
out
nor
hand
nor
purse
till
they
saw
whether
we
could
weather
the
storm
without
their
help
amongst
those
relations
chanced
to
be
a
certain
admiral
patterson
an
uncle
of
my
father
when
we
were
he
had
not
disdained
to
visit
us
in
our
quiet
home
but
when
poverty
came
he
tied
up
his
and
ignored
our
existence
till
at
length
hearing
by
a
mere
chance
that
i
was
supporting
my
mother
and
sister
by
my
own
exertions
always
helped
by
craven
goodness
he
said
audibly
that
the
young
jackanapes
must
have
more
in
him
than
he
thought
and
wrote
to
beg
that
i
would
spend
my
next
holiday
at
his
house
i
was
anxious
to
accept
the
invitation
as
a
friend
told
me
he
felt
certain
the
old
gentleman
would
forward
my
views
but
i
did
not
choose
to
visit
my
relative
in
shabby
clothes
and
with
empty
pockets
therefore
it
fell
out
that
i
jumped
at
miss
blake
suggestion
and
closed
with
craven
offer
on
the
spot
half
fifty
pounds
would
replenish
my
wardrobe
pay
my
travelling
expenses
and
leave
me
with
money
in
my
pocket
as
well
i
told
craven
all
this
in
a
breath
when
i
had
done
so
he
laughed
and
said
you
have
worked
hard
patterson
here
is
ten
pounds
go
and
see
your
uncle
but
leave
river
hall
alone
then
almost
with
tears
i
entreated
him
not
to
baulk
my
purpose
if
i
could
rid
river
hall
of
its
ghost
i
would
take
money
from
him
not
otherwise
i
told
him
i
had
set
my
heart
on
unravelling
the
mystery
attached
to
that
place
and
i
could
have
told
him
another
mystery
at
the
same
time
had
shame
not
tied
my
tongue
i
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
hopelessly
senselessly
with
a
face
of
which
i
thought
all
day
and
dreamed
all
night
that
had
made
itself
in
a
moment
part
and
parcel
of
my
story
thus
i
had
been
at
kentish
town
to
see
one
of
our
clients
and
having
finished
my
business
walked
on
as
far
as
camden
town
intending
to
take
an
omnibus
which
might
set
me
down
somewhere
near
chancery
lane
whilst
standing
at
the
top
of
college
street
under
shelter
of
my
umbrella
a
drizzling
rain
falling
and
rendering
the
pavement
dirty
and
slippery
i
noticed
a
young
lady
waiting
to
cross
the
road
a
young
lady
with
to
my
mind
the
sweetest
fairest
most
lovable
face
on
which
my
eyes
had
ever
rested
i
could
look
at
her
without
causing
annoyance
because
she
was
so
completely
occupied
in
watching
lumbering
vans
fast
carts
crawling
cabs
and
various
other
vehicles
which
chanced
at
that
moment
to
be
crowding
the
thoroughfare
that
she
had
no
leisure
to
bestow
even
a
glance
on
any
pedestrian
a
governess
i
decided
for
her
dress
though
neat
and
even
elegant
was
by
no
means
costly
moreover
there
was
an
expression
of
settled
melancholy
about
her
features
and
further
she
carried
a
roll
which
looked
like
music
in
her
hand
in
less
time
than
it
has
taken
me
to
write
this
paragraph
i
had
settled
all
about
her
to
my
own
satisfaction
father
bankrupt
mother
delicate
young
brothers
and
sisters
probably
all
crying
aloud
for
the
pittance
she
was
able
to
earn
by
giving
lessons
at
so
much
an
hour
she
had
not
been
long
at
her
present
occupation
i
felt
satisfied
for
she
was
evidently
unaccustomed
to
being
out
in
the
streets
alone
on
a
wet
day
i
would
have
offered
to
see
her
across
the
road
but
for
two
reasons
one
because
i
felt
shy
about
proffering
my
services
the
other
because
i
was
exceedingly
doubtful
whether
i
might
not
give
offence
by
speaking
after
the
fashion
of
so
many
of
her
sex
she
made
about
half
a
dozen
false
starts
advancing
as
some
friendly
cabby
made
signs
for
her
to
venture
the
passage
retreating
as
she
caught
sight
of
some
coming
vehicle
still
yards
distant
at
last
imagining
the
way
clear
she
made
a
sudden
rush
and
had
just
got
well
off
the
curb
when
a
mail
phaeton
turned
the
corner
and
in
one
second
she
was
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
i
struggling
with
the
horses
and
swearing
at
the
driver
who
in
his
turn
very
heartily
anathematized
me
i
do
not
remember
all
i
said
to
the
portly
swaggering
cockney
upstart
but
there
was
so
much
in
it
uncomplimentary
to
himself
and
his
driving
that
the
crowd
already
assembled
cheered
as
all
crowds
will
cheer
profane
and
personal
language
and
he
was
glad
enough
to
gather
up
his
reins
and
touch
his
horses
and
trot
off
without
having
first
gone
through
the
ceremony
of
asking
whether
the
girl
he
had
so
nearly
driven
over
was
living
or
dead
meantime
she
had
been
carried
into
the
nearest
shop
whither
i
followed
her
i
do
not
know
why
all
the
people
standing
about
imagined
me
to
be
her
brother
but
they
certainly
did
so
and
under
that
impression
made
way
for
me
to
enter
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
where
i
found
my
poor
beauty
sitting
faint
and
frightened
and
draggled
whilst
the
woman
of
the
house
was
trying
to
wipe
the
mud
off
her
dress
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
her
to
swallow
some
as
i
entered
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
mine
and
said
thank
you
sir
i
trust
you
have
not
got
hurt
yourself
so
frankly
and
so
sweetly
that
the
small
amount
of
heart
her
face
had
left
me
passed
into
her
keeping
at
once
are
you
much
hurt
i
replied
by
asking
my
arm
is
a
little
she
answered
if
i
could
only
get
home
oh
i
wish
i
were
at
home
i
went
out
and
fetched
a
cab
and
assisted
her
into
it
then
i
asked
her
where
the
man
should
drive
and
she
gave
me
the
name
of
the
street
which
miss
blake
when
in
england
honoured
by
making
her
abode
miss
number
was
my
charmer
number
was
having
obtained
this
information
i
closed
the
and
taking
my
seat
beside
the
driver
we
rattled
off
in
the
direction
of
brunswick
square
arrived
at
the
house
i
helped
her
when
in
answer
to
my
knock
an
elderly
woman
appeared
to
ask
my
business
into
the
narrow
hall
of
a
dreary
house
oh
how
my
heart
ached
when
i
beheld
her
surroundings
she
did
not
bid
me
but
asking
me
into
the
parlour
went
as
i
understood
to
get
money
to
pay
the
cabman
seizing
my
opportunity
i
told
the
woman
who
still
stood
near
the
door
that
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
leaving
the
house
bade
the
driver
take
me
to
the
top
of
chancery
lane
on
the
next
sunday
i
watched
no
till
i
beheld
my
come
forth
veiled
furred
dressed
all
in
her
dainty
best
in
hand
going
alone
to
pancras
church
not
the
old
but
the
new
whither
i
followed
her
by
some
freak
of
fortune
the
verger
put
me
into
the
same
pew
as
that
in
which
he
had
just
placed
her
when
she
saw
me
her
face
flushed
crimson
and
then
she
gave
a
little
smile
of
recognition
i
fear
i
did
not
much
heed
the
service
on
that
particular
sunday
but
i
still
felt
shy
so
shy
that
after
i
had
held
the
door
open
for
her
to
pass
out
i
allowed
others
to
come
between
us
and
did
not
dare
to
follow
and
ask
how
she
was
during
the
course
of
the
next
week
came
miss
blake
and
remark
about
the
fifty
pounds
and
within
hours
something
still
more
astounding
occurred
a
visit
from
miss
blake
and
her
niece
who
wanted
a
good
so
miss
blake
stated
it
was
a
dull
foggy
day
and
when
my
eyes
rested
on
the
younger
lady
i
drew
back
closer
into
my
accustomed
corner
frightened
and
amazed
you
were
in
such
a
passion
yesterday
began
miss
blake
coming
into
the
office
dragging
her
blushing
niece
after
her
that
you
put
it
out
of
my
head
to
tell
you
three
things
one
that
we
have
moved
from
our
old
lodgings
the
next
that
i
have
not
a
penny
to
go
on
with
and
the
third
that
helena
here
has
gone
out
of
her
mind
she
wo
have
river
hall
let
again
if
you
please
she
intends
to
go
out
as
a
governess
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
nothing
i
can
say
makes
any
impression
upon
her
i
should
have
thought
she
had
had
enough
of
governessing
the
first
day
she
went
out
to
give
a
lesson
she
got
herself
run
over
and
nearly
killed
was
brought
back
in
a
cab
by
some
gentleman
who
had
the
decency
to
take
the
cab
away
again
for
how
we
should
have
paid
the
fare
i
do
know
i
am
sure
so
i
have
just
brought
her
to
you
to
know
if
her
mother
old
friend
thinks
it
is
a
right
thing
for
kathleen
elmsdale
daughter
to
put
herself
under
the
feet
of
a
parcel
of
ignorant
snobs
craven
looked
at
the
girl
kindly
my
dear
he
said
i
think
i
believe
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
you
to
do
anything
of
that
kind
we
have
found
a
person
have
we
not
patterson
willing
to
devote
himself
to
solving
the
river
hall
mystery
so
for
the
present
at
all
events
helena
he
paused
for
helena
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
i
sat
aunt
aunt
she
said
this
is
the
gentleman
who
stopped
the
horses
and
before
i
could
speak
a
word
she
held
my
hand
in
hers
and
was
thanking
me
once
again
with
her
beautiful
eyes
miss
blake
turned
and
glared
upon
me
oh
it
was
you
was
it
she
said
ungraciously
well
it
is
just
what
i
might
have
expected
and
me
hoping
all
the
time
it
was
a
lord
or
a
baronet
at
the
least
we
all
laughed
even
miss
elmsdale
laughed
at
this
frank
confession
but
when
the
ladies
were
gone
craven
looking
at
me
pityingly
remarked
this
is
a
most
unfortunate
business
patterson
i
hope
i
do
hope
you
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
elmsdale
to
which
i
made
no
reply
the
evil
if
evil
it
were
was
done
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
miss
blake
niece
ere
those
words
of
wisdom
dropped
from
my
employer
lips
my
first
night
at
river
hall
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
depression
for
which
i
could
in
no
way
account
that
one
cold
evening
towards
the
end
of
february
i
left
buckingham
street
and
wended
my
way
to
the
uninhabited
house
i
had
been
eager
to
engage
in
the
enterprise
first
for
the
sake
of
the
fifty
pounds
reward
and
secondly
and
much
more
for
the
sake
of
helena
elmsdale
i
had
tormented
craven
until
he
gave
a
reluctant
consent
to
my
desire
i
had
brooded
over
the
matter
until
i
became
eager
to
commence
my
investigations
as
a
young
soldier
may
be
to
face
the
enemy
and
yet
when
the
evening
came
and
darkness
with
it
when
i
set
my
back
to
the
more
crowded
thoroughfares
and
found
myself
plodding
along
a
lonely
suburban
road
with
a
keen
wind
lashing
my
face
and
a
suspicion
of
rain
at
intervals
wetting
my
cheeks
i
confess
i
had
no
feeling
of
enjoyment
in
my
task
after
all
talking
about
a
haunted
house
in
broad
daylight
to
in
a
large
london
office
is
a
very
different
thing
from
taking
up
one
residence
in
the
same
house
all
alone
on
a
bleak
winter
night
with
never
a
soul
within
shouting
distance
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
through
with
the
matter
and
no
amount
of
mental
depression
no
wintry
blasts
no
cheerless
roads
no
desolate
goal
should
daunt
me
but
still
i
did
not
like
the
adventure
and
at
every
step
i
felt
i
liked
it
less
before
leaving
town
i
had
fortified
my
inner
man
with
a
good
dinner
and
some
excellent
wine
but
by
the
time
i
reached
river
hall
i
might
have
fasted
for
a
week
so
faint
and
spiritless
did
i
feel
come
this
will
never
do
i
thought
as
i
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
uninhabited
house
i
must
not
begin
with
being
or
i
may
as
well
give
up
the
investigation
at
once
the
fires
i
had
caused
to
be
kindled
in
the
morning
though
almost
out
by
the
time
i
reached
river
hall
had
diffused
a
grateful
warmth
throughout
the
house
and
when
i
put
a
match
to
the
paper
and
wood
laid
ready
in
the
grate
of
the
room
i
meant
to
occupy
and
lit
the
gas
in
the
hall
on
the
landing
and
in
my
i
began
to
think
things
did
not
look
so
cheerless
after
all
the
seals
which
for
precaution
sake
i
had
placed
on
the
various
locks
remained
intact
i
looked
to
the
fastenings
of
the
examined
the
screws
by
which
the
bolts
were
attached
to
the
wood
and
having
satisfied
myself
that
everything
of
that
kind
was
secure
went
up
to
my
room
where
the
fire
was
now
crackling
and
blazing
famously
put
the
kettle
on
the
hob
drew
a
chair
up
close
to
the
hearth
exchanged
my
boots
for
slippers
lit
a
pipe
pulled
out
my
and
began
to
read
how
long
i
had
read
i
can
not
say
the
kettle
on
the
hob
was
boiling
at
any
rate
and
the
coals
had
burned
themselves
into
a
mass
of
glowing
cinders
when
my
attention
was
attracted
or
rather
i
should
say
distracted
by
the
sound
of
tapping
outside
the
first
i
listened
and
read
on
then
i
laid
down
my
book
and
listened
more
attentively
it
was
exactly
the
noise
which
a
person
would
make
tapping
upon
glass
with
one
finger
the
wind
had
risen
almost
to
a
tempest
but
in
the
interval
between
each
blast
i
could
hear
the
tapping
as
distinctly
as
if
it
had
been
inside
my
own
skull
tap
tap
imperatively
tap
tap
tap
impatiently
and
when
i
rose
to
approach
the
casement
it
seemed
as
if
three
more
fingers
had
joined
in
the
summons
and
were
rapping
for
bare
life
they
have
begun
betimes
i
thought
and
taking
my
revolver
in
one
hand
with
the
other
i
opened
the
shutters
and
put
aside
the
blind
as
i
did
so
it
seemed
as
if
some
dark
body
occupied
one
side
of
the
sash
while
the
tapping
continued
as
madly
as
before
it
is
as
well
to
confess
at
once
that
i
was
for
the
moment
frightened
subsequently
i
saw
many
wonderful
sights
and
had
some
terrible
experiences
in
the
uninhabited
house
but
i
can
honestly
say
no
sight
or
experience
so
completely
cowed
me
for
the
time
being
as
that
dull
blackness
to
which
i
could
assign
no
shape
that
rapping
of
fleshless
fingers
which
seemed
to
increase
in
vehemence
as
i
obeyed
its
summons
doctors
say
it
is
not
possible
for
the
heart
to
stand
still
and
a
human
being
live
and
as
i
am
not
a
doctor
i
do
not
like
to
contradict
their
dogma
otherwise
i
could
positively
declare
my
heart
did
cease
beating
as
i
listened
looking
out
into
the
night
with
the
shadow
of
that
darkness
projecting
itself
upon
my
mind
to
the
impatient
tapping
which
was
now
distinctly
audible
even
above
the
raging
of
the
storm
how
i
gathered
sufficient
courage
to
do
it
i
can
not
tell
but
i
put
my
face
close
to
the
glass
thus
shutting
out
the
gas
and
and
saw
that
the
dark
object
which
alarmed
me
was
a
mass
of
ivy
the
wind
had
detached
from
the
wall
and
that
the
invisible
fingers
were
young
branches
straying
from
the
main
body
of
the
plant
which
tossed
by
the
kept
striking
the
window
incessantly
now
one
now
two
now
three
tap
tap
tap
tap
tap
tap
tap
and
sometimes
after
a
long
silence
all
together
like
the
sound
of
clamming
bells
i
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
listening
to
the
noise
so
as
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
its
cause
then
i
laid
down
the
revolver
took
out
my
and
opened
the
window
as
i
did
so
a
tremendous
blast
swept
into
the
room
extinguishing
the
gas
causing
the
glowing
coals
to
turn
for
a
moment
black
on
one
side
and
to
fiercest
blaze
on
the
other
scattering
the
dust
lying
on
the
hearth
over
the
carpet
and
dashing
the
against
my
face
with
a
force
which
caused
my
cheeks
to
smart
and
tingle
long
afterwards
taking
my
revenge
i
cut
them
as
far
back
as
i
could
and
then
without
closing
the
window
and
keeping
my
breath
as
well
as
i
could
i
looked
out
across
the
garden
over
the
thames
away
to
the
opposite
bank
where
a
few
lights
glimmered
at
long
intervals
an
eerie
lonely
place
for
a
fellow
to
be
in
all
by
himself
i
continued
and
yet
if
the
rest
of
the
ghosts
bodiless
or
clothed
with
flesh
which
frequent
this
house
prove
to
be
as
readily
laid
as
those
i
shall
earn
my
money
and
my
thanks
easily
enough
so
considering
i
relit
the
gas
replenished
the
fire
refilled
my
pipe
reseated
myself
by
the
hearth
and
with
feet
stretched
out
towards
the
genial
blaze
attempted
to
resume
my
reading
all
in
vain
i
could
not
fix
my
attention
on
the
page
i
could
not
connect
one
sentence
with
another
when
my
mind
ought
to
have
concentrated
its
energies
upon
justice
that
and
this
and
lord
somebody
else
i
felt
it
wandering
away
trying
to
fit
together
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
evidence
worthy
or
unworthy
concerning
the
uninhabited
house
which
really
was
as
we
had
always
stated
a
good
house
a
remarkably
good
house
well
furnished
suitable
in
every
respect
had
i
been
a
family
of
respectability
or
a
gentleman
of
position
with
a
large
number
of
servants
a
nice
wife
and
a
few
children
sprinkled
about
the
domestic
picture
i
doubt
not
i
should
have
enjoyed
the
contemplation
of
that
glowing
fire
and
rejoiced
in
the
idea
of
finding
myself
located
in
so
desirable
a
residence
within
an
easy
distance
of
the
west
end
but
as
matters
stood
i
felt
anything
rather
than
elated
in
that
large
house
there
was
no
human
inmate
save
myself
and
i
had
an
attack
of
nervousness
upon
me
for
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
account
here
was
i
at
length
under
the
very
roof
where
my
mistress
had
passed
all
her
childish
days
bound
to
solve
the
mystery
which
was
making
such
havoc
with
her
young
life
permitted
to
essay
a
task
the
accomplishment
of
which
should
cover
me
with
glory
and
perhaps
restore
peace
and
happiness
to
her
heart
and
yet
i
was
i
did
not
hesitate
to
utter
that
word
to
my
own
soul
then
any
more
than
i
hesitate
to
write
it
now
for
those
who
list
to
read
for
i
can
truly
say
i
think
there
are
few
men
whose
courage
such
an
adventure
would
not
try
were
they
to
attempt
it
and
i
am
sure
had
any
one
of
those
to
whom
i
tell
this
story
been
half
as
much
afraid
as
i
he
would
have
left
river
hall
there
and
then
and
allowed
the
ghosts
said
to
be
resident
to
haunt
it
undisturbed
for
evermore
if
i
could
only
have
kept
memory
from
running
here
and
there
in
quest
of
evidence
pro
and
con
the
house
being
haunted
i
should
have
fared
better
but
i
could
not
do
this
let
me
try
as
i
would
to
give
my
attention
to
those
legal
studies
that
ought
to
have
engrossed
my
attention
i
could
not
succeed
in
doing
so
my
thoughts
without
any
volition
on
my
part
kept
continually
on
the
move
now
with
miss
blake
in
buckingham
street
again
with
colonel
morris
on
the
river
walk
once
more
with
miss
elmsdale
in
the
library
and
went
constantly
flitting
hither
and
thither
recalling
the
experiences
of
a
frightened
lad
or
the
terror
of
an
ignorant
woman
yet
withal
i
had
a
feeling
that
in
some
way
memory
was
playing
me
false
as
if
when
ostentatiously
bringing
out
all
her
stores
for
me
to
make
or
mar
as
i
could
she
had
really
hidden
away
in
one
of
her
remotest
corners
some
link
great
or
little
as
the
case
might
be
but
still
whether
great
or
little
necessary
to
connect
the
unsatisfactory
narratives
together
till
late
in
the
night
i
sat
trying
to
piece
my
puzzle
together
but
without
success
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
story
a
missing
point
in
it
somewhere
i
felt
certain
i
often
imagined
i
was
about
to
touch
it
when
heigh
presto
it
eluded
my
grasp
the
whole
affair
will
resolve
itself
into
i
finally
if
not
truthfully
decided
i
am
satisfied
it
is
all
ivy
and
i
went
to
bed
now
whether
it
was
that
i
had
thought
too
much
of
the
ghostly
narratives
associated
with
river
hall
the
storminess
of
the
night
the
fact
of
sleeping
in
a
strange
room
or
the
strength
of
a
tumbler
of
in
which
brandy
took
an
undue
lead
i
can
not
tell
but
during
the
morning
hours
i
dreamed
a
dream
which
filled
me
with
an
unspeakable
horror
from
which
i
awoke
struggling
for
breath
bathed
in
a
cold
perspiration
and
with
a
dread
upon
me
such
as
i
never
felt
in
any
waking
moment
of
my
life
i
dreamt
i
was
lying
asleep
in
the
room
i
actually
occupied
when
i
was
aroused
from
a
profound
slumber
by
the
noise
produced
by
some
one
tapping
at
the
on
rising
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
this
summons
i
saw
colonel
morris
standing
outside
and
beckoning
me
to
join
him
with
that
disregard
of
space
time
distance
and
attire
which
obtains
in
dreams
i
at
once
stepped
out
into
the
garden
it
was
a
night
and
bitterly
cold
and
i
shivered
i
know
as
i
heard
the
sullen
flow
of
the
river
and
listened
to
the
moaning
of
the
wind
among
the
trees
we
walked
on
for
some
minutes
in
silence
then
my
companion
asked
me
if
i
felt
afraid
or
if
i
would
go
on
with
him
i
will
go
where
you
go
i
answered
then
suddenly
he
disappeared
and
playfire
who
had
been
his
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
trial
took
my
hand
and
led
me
onwards
we
passed
through
a
doorway
and
still
in
darkness
utter
darkness
began
to
descend
some
steps
we
went
down
down
hundreds
of
steps
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
in
my
sleep
i
still
remembered
the
old
idea
of
its
being
unlucky
to
dream
of
going
downstairs
but
at
length
we
came
to
the
bottom
and
then
began
winding
along
interminable
passages
now
so
narrow
only
one
could
walk
abreast
and
again
so
low
that
we
had
to
stoop
our
heads
in
order
to
avoid
striking
the
roof
after
we
had
been
walking
along
these
for
hours
as
time
reckons
in
such
cases
we
commenced
ascending
flight
after
flight
of
steep
i
laboured
after
playfire
till
my
limbs
ached
and
grew
weary
till
scarcely
able
to
drag
my
feet
from
stair
to
stair
i
entreated
him
to
stop
but
he
only
laughed
and
held
on
his
course
the
more
rapidly
while
i
hurrying
after
often
stumbled
and
recovered
myself
then
stumbled
again
and
lay
prone
the
night
air
blew
cold
and
chill
upon
me
as
i
crawled
out
into
an
unaccustomed
place
and
felt
my
way
over
heaps
of
uneven
earth
and
stones
that
obstructed
my
progress
in
every
direction
i
called
out
for
playfire
but
the
wind
alone
answered
me
i
shouted
for
colonel
morris
i
entreated
some
one
to
tell
me
where
i
was
and
in
answer
there
was
a
dead
and
terrible
silence
the
wind
died
away
not
a
breath
of
air
disturbed
the
heavy
stillness
which
had
fallen
so
suddenly
around
me
instead
of
the
veil
of
merciful
blackness
which
had
hidden
everything
hitherto
from
view
a
gray
light
spread
slowly
over
the
objects
around
revealing
a
with
an
old
church
standing
in
the
midst
a
where
grew
rank
nettles
and
coarse
tall
grass
where
brambles
trailed
over
the
graves
and
weeds
and
decay
consorted
with
the
dead
moved
by
some
impulse
which
i
could
not
resist
i
still
held
on
my
course
over
mounds
of
earth
between
rows
of
headstones
till
i
reached
the
other
side
of
the
church
under
the
shadow
of
which
yawned
an
open
pit
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
peered
and
there
beheld
an
empty
coffin
the
lid
was
laid
against
the
side
of
the
grave
and
on
a
headstone
displaced
from
its
upright
position
sat
the
late
occupant
of
the
grave
looking
at
me
with
wistful
eager
eyes
a
stream
of
light
from
within
the
church
fell
across
that
one
empty
grave
that
one
dead
watcher
so
you
have
come
at
last
he
said
and
then
the
spell
was
broken
and
i
would
have
fled
but
that
holding
me
with
his
left
hand
he
pointed
with
his
right
away
to
a
shadowy
distance
where
the
gray
sky
merged
into
deepest
black
i
strained
my
eyes
to
discover
the
object
he
strove
to
indicate
but
i
failed
to
do
so
i
could
just
discern
something
flitting
away
into
the
darkness
but
i
could
give
it
no
shape
or
substance
look
look
the
dead
man
said
rising
in
his
excitement
and
clutching
me
more
firmly
with
his
fingers
i
tried
to
fly
but
i
could
not
my
feet
were
chained
to
the
spot
i
fought
to
rid
myself
of
the
clasp
of
the
skeleton
hand
and
then
we
fell
together
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
i
awoke
a
temporary
peace
it
was
scarcely
light
when
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
murmuring
thank
god
it
was
only
a
dream
dressed
myself
with
all
speed
and
flinging
open
the
window
looked
out
on
a
calm
morning
after
the
previous
night
storm
muddily
and
angrily
the
thames
rolled
onward
to
the
sea
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
i
could
see
stretches
of
green
with
here
and
there
a
house
dotting
the
banks
a
fleet
of
barges
lay
waiting
the
turn
of
the
tide
to
proceed
to
their
destination
the
voices
of
the
men
shouting
to
each
other
and
blaspheming
for
no
particular
reason
came
quite
clear
and
distinct
over
the
water
the
garden
was
strewed
with
twigs
and
branches
blown
off
the
trees
during
the
night
amongst
them
the
sprigs
of
ivy
i
had
myself
cut
off
an
hour
and
a
scene
not
calculated
to
encourage
superstitious
fancies
it
may
be
but
still
not
likely
to
enliven
any
man
spirits
a
quiet
dull
gray
listless
dispiriting
morning
and
being
i
felt
its
influence
i
will
walk
into
town
and
ask
ned
munro
to
give
me
some
breakfast
i
thought
and
found
comfort
in
the
idea
ned
munro
was
a
doctor
but
not
a
struggling
doctor
he
was
not
rich
but
he
made
enough
for
a
beginner
so
he
said
he
worked
hard
for
little
pay
but
i
mean
some
day
to
have
high
pay
and
take
the
world
easy
he
explained
he
was
blessed
with
great
hopes
and
good
courage
he
had
high
spirits
and
a
splendid
constitution
he
neither
starved
himself
nor
his
friends
his
landlady
loved
him
as
her
son
and
there
were
several
girls
who
were
very
fond
of
him
not
as
a
brother
but
ned
had
no
notion
of
marrying
yet
awhile
time
enough
for
that
he
told
me
once
when
i
can
furnish
a
good
house
and
set
up
a
brougham
and
choose
my
patients
and
have
a
few
hundreds
lying
idle
in
the
bank
meantime
as
no
one
of
these
items
had
yet
been
realized
he
lived
in
lodgings
ate
toasted
haddocks
with
his
morning
coffee
and
smoked
and
read
novels
far
into
the
night
yes
i
could
go
and
breakfast
with
munro
just
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
gas
i
had
left
lighted
when
i
went
to
bed
was
out
that
the
door
i
had
left
locked
was
open
straight
downstairs
i
went
the
gas
in
the
hall
was
out
and
every
door
i
had
myself
closed
and
locked
the
previous
morning
stood
ajar
with
the
seal
however
remaining
intact
i
had
borne
as
much
as
i
could
my
nerves
were
utterly
unhinged
snatching
my
hat
and
coat
i
left
the
house
and
fled
rather
than
walked
towards
london
with
every
step
i
took
towards
town
came
renewed
courage
and
when
i
reached
ned
lodgings
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
pusillanimity
i
have
been
that
is
what
it
is
i
decided
i
have
opened
the
doors
and
turned
off
the
gas
myself
and
been
frightened
at
the
work
of
my
own
hands
i
will
ask
munro
what
is
the
best
thing
to
insure
a
quiet
night
which
i
did
accordingly
receiving
for
answer
keep
a
quiet
mind
yes
but
if
one
can
not
keep
a
quiet
mind
if
one
is
anxious
and
excited
and
in
love
he
finished
as
i
hesitated
well
no
i
did
not
mean
that
i
said
though
of
course
that
might
enter
into
the
case
also
suppose
one
is
uneasy
about
a
certain
amount
of
money
for
instance
are
you
he
asked
ignoring
the
general
suggestiveness
of
my
remark
well
yes
i
want
to
make
some
if
i
can
do
want
then
he
advised
take
my
word
for
it
no
amount
of
money
is
worth
the
loss
of
a
night
rest
and
you
have
been
tossing
about
all
night
i
can
see
come
patterson
if
it
forgery
or
embezzlement
out
with
it
man
and
i
will
help
you
if
i
am
able
if
it
were
either
one
or
the
other
i
should
go
to
craven
i
answered
laughing
then
it
must
be
love
remarked
my
host
and
you
will
want
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
some
day
the
old
story
i
suppose
beautiful
girl
stern
parents
wealthy
suitor
poor
lover
i
wonder
if
we
could
interest
her
in
a
case
of
if
she
took
it
badly
you
might
have
a
chance
but
i
have
a
presentiment
that
she
has
been
vaccinated
ned
was
my
protest
i
shall
certainly
fling
a
plate
at
your
head
all
right
if
you
think
the
exertion
would
do
you
good
he
answered
give
me
your
hand
patterson
and
before
i
knew
what
he
wanted
with
it
he
had
his
fingers
on
my
wrist
look
here
old
fellow
he
said
you
will
be
laid
up
if
you
take
care
of
yourself
i
thought
so
when
you
came
in
and
i
am
sure
of
it
now
what
have
you
been
doing
nothing
wrong
munro
i
answered
smiling
in
spite
of
myself
i
have
not
been
picking
or
stealing
or
abducting
any
young
woman
or
courting
my
neighbour
wife
but
i
am
worried
and
perplexed
when
i
sleep
i
have
dreadful
dreams
horrible
dreams
i
added
shuddering
can
you
tell
me
what
is
worrying
and
perplexing
you
he
asked
kindly
after
a
moment
thought
not
yet
ned
i
answered
though
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
soon
give
me
something
to
make
me
sleep
quietly
that
is
all
i
want
now
ca
you
go
out
of
town
he
inquired
i
do
not
want
to
go
out
of
town
i
answered
i
will
make
you
up
something
to
strengthen
your
nerves
he
said
after
a
pause
but
if
you
are
not
better
well
before
the
end
of
the
week
take
my
advice
and
run
down
to
brighton
over
sunday
now
you
ought
to
give
me
a
guinea
for
that
he
added
laughing
i
assure
you
all
the
cane
all
the
wonderful
chronometer
doctors
who
pocket
thousands
per
annum
at
the
west
end
could
make
no
more
of
your
case
than
i
have
done
i
am
sure
they
could
not
i
said
gratefully
and
when
i
have
the
guinea
to
spare
be
sure
i
shall
not
forget
your
fee
whether
it
was
owing
to
his
medicine
or
his
advice
or
his
cheery
manner
i
have
no
idea
but
that
night
when
i
walked
towards
the
uninhabited
house
i
felt
a
different
being
on
my
way
i
called
at
a
small
and
bought
a
quartern
of
flour
done
up
in
a
thin
and
utterly
insufficient
bag
i
told
the
man
the
wrapper
would
not
bear
its
contents
and
he
said
he
could
not
help
that
i
asked
him
if
he
had
no
stronger
bags
he
answered
that
he
had
but
he
could
not
afford
to
give
them
away
i
laid
down
twopence
extra
and
inquired
if
that
would
cover
the
expense
of
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
ashamed
he
turned
aside
and
produced
a
substantial
bag
into
which
he
put
the
flour
in
its
envelope
of
i
thanked
him
and
pushed
the
twopence
across
the
counter
with
a
grunt
he
thrust
the
money
back
i
said
leaving
current
coin
of
the
realm
to
the
amount
indicated
behind
me
through
the
night
be
shouted
hi
sir
you
forgotten
your
change
through
the
night
i
shouted
back
give
your
next
customer
its
value
in
civility
all
of
which
did
me
good
squabbling
with
flesh
and
blood
is
not
a
bad
preliminary
to
entering
a
house
once
again
i
was
at
river
hall
looking
up
at
its
cheerless
portal
i
was
amazed
at
first
to
see
the
outside
lamp
flaring
away
in
the
darkness
then
i
remembered
that
all
the
other
gas
being
out
of
course
this
which
i
had
not
turned
off
would
blaze
more
brightly
purposely
i
had
left
my
return
till
rather
late
i
had
gone
to
one
of
the
theatres
and
remained
until
a
third
through
the
principal
piece
then
i
called
at
a
had
half
a
dozen
oysters
and
some
stout
after
which
like
a
giant
refreshed
i
wended
my
way
westward
utterly
false
would
it
be
for
me
to
say
i
liked
the
idea
of
entering
the
uninhabited
house
but
still
i
meant
to
do
it
and
i
did
no
for
me
that
night
no
seductive
fire
no
shining
lights
all
over
the
house
like
a
householder
of
twenty
years
standing
i
struck
a
match
and
turned
the
gas
on
to
a
single
i
did
not
trouble
myself
even
about
shutting
the
doors
opening
into
the
hall
i
only
strewed
flour
copiously
over
the
marble
pavement
and
on
the
first
flight
of
stairs
and
then
by
the
servant
passages
crept
into
the
upper
story
and
so
to
bed
that
night
i
slept
dreamlessly
i
awoke
in
broad
daylight
wondering
why
i
had
not
been
called
sooner
and
then
remembered
there
was
no
one
to
call
and
that
if
i
required
hot
water
i
must
boil
it
for
myself
with
that
light
heart
which
comes
after
a
good
night
rest
i
put
on
some
part
of
my
clothing
and
was
commencing
to
descend
the
principal
staircase
when
my
proceedings
of
the
previous
night
flashed
across
my
mind
and
pausing
i
looked
down
into
the
hall
no
sign
of
a
foot
on
the
flour
the
white
powder
lay
there
innocent
of
human
pressure
as
the
untrodden
snow
and
yet
and
yet
was
i
dreaming
could
i
have
been
drunk
without
my
own
knowledge
before
i
went
to
bed
the
gas
was
ablaze
in
the
hall
and
on
the
staircase
and
every
door
left
open
was
close
shut
curiously
enough
at
that
moment
fear
fell
from
me
like
a
garment
which
has
served
its
turn
and
in
the
strength
of
my
manhood
i
felt
able
to
face
anything
the
uninhabited
house
might
have
to
show
over
the
latter
part
of
that
week
as
being
utterly
unimportant
in
its
events
or
consequences
i
pass
rapidly
only
saying
that
when
saturday
came
i
followed
munro
advice
and
ran
down
to
brighton
under
the
idea
that
by
so
doing
i
should
thoroughly
strengthen
myself
for
the
next
five
days
ordeal
but
the
idea
was
a
mistaken
one
the
uninhabited
house
took
its
ticket
for
brighton
by
the
same
express
it
got
into
the
compartment
with
me
it
sat
beside
me
at
dinner
it
to
me
over
my
own
wine
uninvited
it
came
out
to
walk
with
me
and
when
i
stood
still
listening
to
the
band
it
stood
still
too
it
went
with
me
to
the
pier
and
when
the
wind
blew
as
the
wind
did
it
said
we
were
quite
as
well
off
on
the
thames
when
i
woke
through
the
night
it
seemed
to
shout
are
you
any
better
off
here
and
when
i
went
to
church
the
next
day
it
crept
close
up
to
me
in
the
pew
and
said
come
now
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
you
are
a
christian
but
if
you
were
really
one
you
would
not
be
afraid
of
the
place
you
and
i
wot
of
finally
i
was
so
goaded
and
maddened
that
i
shook
my
fist
at
the
sea
and
started
off
by
the
evening
train
for
the
uninhabited
house
this
time
i
travelled
alone
the
uninhabited
house
preceded
me
there
in
its
old
position
looking
gloomy
and
mysterious
in
the
shadows
of
night
i
found
it
on
my
return
to
town
and
as
if
tired
of
playing
tricks
with
one
who
had
become
indifferent
to
their
vagaries
all
the
doors
remained
precisely
as
i
had
left
them
and
if
there
were
ghosts
in
the
house
that
night
they
did
not
interfere
with
me
or
the
chamber
i
occupied
next
morning
while
i
was
dressing
a
most
remarkable
thing
occurred
a
thing
for
which
i
was
in
no
wise
prepared
spirits
and
sights
and
sounds
supposed
appropriate
to
spirithood
i
had
expected
but
for
a
modest
knock
at
the
front
door
i
was
not
prepared
when
after
hurriedly
completing
my
toilet
i
undrew
the
bolts
and
undid
the
chain
and
opened
the
door
wide
there
came
rushing
into
the
house
a
keen
easterly
wind
behind
which
i
beheld
a
woman
dressed
in
black
who
dropped
me
a
curtsey
and
said
if
you
please
sir
i
suppose
you
are
the
gentleman
now
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
this
so
i
asked
her
to
be
good
enough
to
explain
then
it
all
came
out
did
i
want
a
person
to
char
this
was
remarkable
very
her
question
amazed
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
had
to
ask
her
in
and
request
her
to
seat
herself
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs
and
go
upstairs
myself
and
think
the
matter
over
before
i
answered
her
it
had
been
so
impressed
upon
me
that
no
one
in
the
neighbourhood
would
come
near
river
hall
that
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
victoria
by
the
grace
of
god
paying
me
a
friendly
visit
as
of
being
waited
on
by
a
charwoman
i
went
downstairs
again
at
sight
of
me
my
new
acquaintance
rose
from
her
seat
and
began
curling
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
do
you
know
i
said
that
this
house
bears
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
i
have
heard
people
say
it
is
sir
she
answered
and
do
you
know
that
servants
will
not
stay
in
it
that
tenants
will
not
occupy
it
i
have
heard
so
sir
she
answered
once
again
then
what
do
you
mean
by
offering
to
come
i
inquired
she
looked
up
into
my
face
and
i
saw
the
tears
come
softly
stealing
into
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
began
to
pucker
ere
drooping
her
head
she
replied
sir
just
three
months
ago
come
the
twentieth
i
was
a
happy
woman
i
had
a
good
husband
and
a
tidy
home
there
was
not
a
lady
in
the
land
i
would
have
changed
places
with
but
that
night
my
man
coming
home
in
a
fog
fell
into
the
river
and
was
drowned
it
was
a
week
before
they
found
him
and
all
the
time
while
i
had
been
hoping
to
hear
his
step
every
minute
in
the
day
i
was
a
widow
poor
soul
i
said
involuntarily
well
sir
when
a
man
goes
all
goes
i
have
done
my
best
but
still
i
have
not
been
able
to
feed
my
children
his
children
properly
and
the
sight
of
their
poor
pinched
faces
breaks
my
heart
it
do
sir
and
she
burst
out
sobbing
and
so
i
suppose
i
remarked
you
thought
you
would
face
this
house
rather
than
poverty
yes
sir
i
heard
the
neighbours
talking
about
this
place
and
you
sir
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
and
ask
if
i
might
tidy
up
things
a
bit
for
you
sir
i
was
a
servant
sir
before
i
married
and
i
be
so
thankful
well
to
cut
the
affair
shorter
for
the
reader
than
i
was
able
to
do
for
myself
i
gave
her
half
a
crown
and
told
her
i
would
think
over
her
proposal
and
let
her
hear
from
me
which
i
did
i
told
her
she
might
come
for
a
couple
of
hours
each
morning
and
a
couple
each
evening
and
she
could
bring
one
of
the
children
with
her
if
she
thought
she
was
likely
to
find
the
place
lonely
i
would
not
let
her
come
in
the
because
in
the
quest
i
had
set
myself
it
was
needful
i
should
feel
assured
no
person
could
have
an
opportunity
of
elaborating
any
scheme
for
frightening
me
on
the
premises
real
ghosts
said
i
to
craven
i
do
not
mind
but
the
physical
agencies
which
may
produce
ghosts
i
would
rather
avoid
acting
on
which
principle
i
always
remained
in
the
house
while
stott
my
charwoman
was
so
named
cleaned
and
cooked
and
boiled
and
put
things
straight
no
one
can
imagine
what
a
revolution
this
woman
effected
in
my
ways
and
habits
and
in
the
ways
and
habits
of
the
uninhabited
house
tradesmen
called
for
orders
the
butcher
boy
came
whistling
down
the
lane
to
deliver
the
or
i
had
decided
on
for
dinner
the
greengrocer
delivered
his
vegetables
the
cheesemonger
took
solemn
affidavit
concerning
the
freshness
of
his
stale
eggs
and
the
superior
quality
of
a
curious
article
which
he
called
country
butter
and
declared
came
from
a
particular
dairy
famed
for
the
excellence
of
its
produce
the
milkman
yahoo
sounded
cheerfully
in
the
morning
hours
and
the
was
filled
with
cards
from
all
sorts
and
descriptions
of
people
from
laundresses
to
wine
merchants
from
gardeners
to
undertakers
the
doors
now
never
shut
nor
opened
of
their
own
accord
a
great
peace
seemed
to
have
settled
over
river
hall
it
was
all
too
peaceful
in
fact
i
had
gone
to
the
place
to
hunt
a
ghost
and
not
even
the
ghost
of
a
ghost
seemed
inclined
to
reveal
itself
to
me
the
watcher
is
watched
i
have
never
been
able
exactly
to
satisfy
my
own
mind
as
to
the
precise
period
during
my
occupation
of
the
uninhabited
house
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
being
watched
hazily
i
must
have
had
some
consciousness
of
the
fact
long
before
i
began
seriously
to
entertain
the
idea
i
felt
even
when
i
was
walking
through
london
that
i
was
being
often
kept
in
sight
by
some
person
i
had
that
vague
notion
of
a
stranger
being
interested
in
my
movements
which
it
is
so
impossible
to
define
to
a
friend
and
which
one
is
chary
of
seriously
discussing
with
oneself
frequently
when
the
corner
of
a
street
was
reached
i
found
myself
involuntarily
turning
to
look
back
and
prompted
by
instinct
i
suppose
for
there
was
no
reason
about
the
matter
i
varied
my
route
to
and
from
the
uninhabited
house
as
much
as
the
nature
of
the
roads
permitted
further
i
ceased
to
be
punctual
as
to
my
hours
of
business
sometimes
arriving
at
the
office
late
and
if
craven
had
anything
for
me
to
do
cityward
returning
direct
from
thence
to
river
hall
without
touching
buckingham
street
by
this
time
february
had
drawn
to
a
close
and
better
weather
might
therefore
have
been
expected
instead
of
which
one
evening
as
i
paced
westward
snow
began
to
fall
and
continued
coming
down
till
somewhere
about
midnight
next
morning
stott
drew
my
attention
to
certain
footmarks
on
the
walks
and
beneath
the
library
and
windows
the
footmarks
evidently
of
a
man
whose
feet
were
not
a
pair
with
the
keenest
interest
i
examined
these
traces
of
a
human
pursuer
clearly
the
footprints
had
been
made
by
only
one
person
and
that
person
deformed
in
some
way
not
merely
was
the
right
different
from
that
of
the
left
but
the
way
in
which
its
owner
put
it
to
the
ground
must
have
been
different
also
the
one
mark
was
clear
and
distinct
cut
out
in
the
snow
with
a
firm
tread
while
the
other
left
a
little
broken
bank
at
its
right
edge
and
scarcely
any
impression
of
the
heel
slightly
lame
i
decided
eases
his
right
foot
and
has
his
boots
made
to
order
it
is
very
odd
i
remarked
aloud
to
stott
that
it
is
sir
she
answered
adding
i
hope
to
gracious
none
of
them
mobsmen
are
going
to
come
burglaring
here
pooh
i
replied
there
is
nothing
for
them
to
steal
except
chairs
and
tables
and
i
do
think
one
man
could
carry
many
of
them
away
the
whole
of
that
day
i
found
my
thoughts
reverting
to
those
in
the
snow
what
purpose
anyone
proposed
to
serve
by
prowling
about
river
hall
i
could
not
imagine
before
taking
up
my
residence
in
the
uninhabited
house
i
had
a
theory
that
some
malicious
person
or
persons
was
trying
to
keep
the
place
unoccupied
nay
further
imagination
suggested
the
idea
that
owing
to
its
proximity
to
the
river
elmsdale
hall
might
have
taken
the
fancy
of
a
gang
of
smugglers
who
had
provided
for
themselves
means
of
ingress
and
egress
unknown
to
the
outside
world
but
all
notions
of
this
kind
now
seemed
preposterous
slowly
but
surely
the
conviction
had
been
gaining
upon
me
that
let
the
mystery
of
river
hall
be
what
it
would
no
ordinary
explanation
could
account
for
the
phenomena
which
it
had
presented
to
tenant
after
tenant
and
my
own
experiences
in
the
house
slight
though
they
were
tended
to
satisfy
me
there
was
something
beyond
malice
or
interest
at
work
about
the
place
the
very
peace
vouchsafed
to
me
seemed
another
element
of
mystery
since
it
would
certainly
have
been
natural
for
any
person
to
inaugurate
a
series
of
ghostly
spectacles
for
the
benefit
of
an
investigator
like
myself
and
yet
somehow
the
absence
of
supernatural
appearances
and
the
presence
of
that
shadowy
human
being
who
thought
it
worth
while
to
track
my
movements
and
who
had
at
last
left
tangible
proof
of
his
reality
behind
him
in
the
snow
linked
themselves
together
in
my
mind
if
there
is
really
anyone
watching
me
i
finally
decided
there
must
be
a
deeper
mystery
attached
to
river
hall
than
has
yet
been
suspected
now
the
first
thing
is
to
make
sure
that
some
one
is
watching
me
and
the
next
to
guard
against
danger
from
him
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
made
a
for
me
curious
purchase
in
a
little
shop
situated
in
a
back
street
i
bought
half
a
dozen
reels
of
black
this
cotton
on
my
return
home
i
attached
to
the
outside
the
window
and
wound
across
the
walk
and
round
such
trees
and
shrubs
as
grew
in
positions
convenient
for
my
purpose
if
these
threads
are
broken
morning
i
shall
know
i
have
a
foe
to
encounter
i
thought
next
morning
i
found
all
the
threads
fastened
across
the
walks
leading
round
by
the
library
and
snapped
in
two
it
was
then
flesh
and
blood
i
had
come
out
to
fight
and
i
decided
that
night
to
keep
watch
as
usual
i
went
up
to
my
bedroom
and
after
keeping
the
gas
burning
for
about
the
time
i
ordinarily
spent
in
undressing
put
out
the
light
softly
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
stole
still
silently
along
the
passage
and
so
into
a
large
apartment
with
windows
which
overlooked
both
the
library
and
it
was
here
i
knew
that
miss
elmsdale
must
have
heard
her
father
walking
past
the
door
and
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
as
i
stepped
across
the
room
a
nervous
chill
seemed
for
the
moment
to
take
my
courage
captive
if
any
reader
will
consider
the
matter
mine
was
not
an
enviable
position
alone
in
a
desolate
house
reputed
to
be
haunted
watching
for
some
one
who
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
place
to
watch
it
and
me
closely
it
was
still
early
not
later
than
ten
i
had
concluded
to
keep
my
vigil
until
after
midnight
and
tried
to
while
away
the
time
with
thoughts
foreign
to
the
matter
in
hand
all
in
vain
however
let
me
force
what
subject
i
pleased
upon
my
mind
it
reverted
persistently
to
elmsdale
and
the
circumstances
of
his
death
why
did
he
commit
suicide
i
speculated
if
he
had
lost
money
was
that
any
reason
why
he
should
shoot
himself
people
had
done
so
i
was
aware
and
people
probably
would
continue
to
do
so
but
not
men
such
as
robert
elmsdale
was
reputed
to
have
been
he
was
not
so
old
that
the
achievement
of
a
second
success
should
have
seemed
impossible
his
credit
was
good
his
actual
position
unsuspected
river
hall
unhaunted
was
not
a
bad
property
and
in
those
days
he
could
have
sold
it
advantageously
i
could
not
understand
the
motive
of
his
suicide
unless
indeed
he
was
mad
or
drunk
at
the
time
and
then
i
began
to
wonder
whether
anything
about
his
life
had
come
out
on
the
inquest
anything
concerning
habits
associates
and
connections
had
there
been
any
other
undercurrent
besides
betting
in
his
life
brought
out
in
evidence
which
might
help
me
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
i
will
ask
craven
i
thought
whether
he
has
a
copy
of
the
containing
a
report
of
the
inquest
perhaps
what
possibility
i
was
about
to
suggest
to
my
own
mind
i
shall
never
now
know
for
at
that
moment
there
flamed
out
upon
the
garden
a
broad
strong
flame
of
light
a
flame
which
came
so
swiftly
and
suddenly
that
a
man
creeping
along
the
river
walk
had
not
time
to
step
out
of
its
influence
before
i
had
caught
full
sight
of
him
there
was
not
much
to
see
however
a
man
about
the
middle
height
muffled
in
a
cloak
wearing
a
cap
the
peak
of
which
was
drawn
down
over
his
forehead
that
was
all
i
could
discern
ere
cowering
back
from
the
light
he
stole
away
into
the
darkness
had
i
yielded
to
my
first
impulse
i
should
have
rushed
after
him
in
pursuit
but
an
instant
reflection
told
me
how
worse
than
futile
such
a
chase
must
prove
cunning
must
be
met
with
cunning
watching
with
watching
if
i
could
discover
who
he
was
i
should
have
taken
the
first
step
towards
solving
the
mystery
of
river
hall
but
i
should
never
do
so
by
putting
him
on
his
guard
the
immediate
business
lying
at
that
moment
to
my
hand
was
to
discover
whence
came
the
flare
of
light
which
streaming
across
the
walk
had
revealed
the
intruder
presence
to
me
for
that
business
i
can
truthfully
say
i
felt
little
inclination
nevertheless
it
had
to
be
undertaken
so
walking
downstairs
i
unlocked
and
opened
the
and
found
as
i
anticipated
the
room
in
utter
darkness
i
examined
the
fastenings
of
the
shutters
they
were
secure
as
i
had
left
them
i
looked
into
the
not
even
a
rat
lay
concealed
there
i
turned
the
cocks
of
the
gas
lights
but
no
gas
whistled
through
the
pipes
for
the
service
to
the
library
was
separate
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
house
and
capable
of
being
shut
off
at
pleasure
i
mindful
of
the
lights
said
to
have
been
seen
emanating
from
that
room
had
taken
away
the
key
from
the
internal
tap
so
that
gas
could
not
be
used
without
my
knowledge
or
the
possession
of
a
second
key
therefore
as
i
have
said
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
to
find
the
library
in
darkness
nor
could
i
say
the
fact
of
the
light
flaring
apparently
from
a
room
surprised
me
either
for
a
long
time
i
had
been
expecting
to
see
this
phenomenon
now
when
i
did
see
it
i
involuntarily
connected
the
light
the
apartment
and
the
stranger
together
for
he
was
no
ghost
ghosts
do
not
leave
footmarks
behind
them
in
the
snow
ghosts
do
not
break
threads
of
cotton
it
was
a
man
i
had
seen
in
the
garden
and
it
was
my
business
to
trace
out
the
connection
between
him
and
the
appearances
at
river
hall
thinking
thus
i
left
the
library
extinguished
the
candle
by
the
aid
of
which
i
had
made
the
investigations
stated
above
and
after
lowering
the
gaslight
i
always
kept
burning
in
the
hall
began
ascending
the
broad
handsome
staircase
when
i
was
met
by
the
figure
of
a
man
descending
the
steps
i
say
advisedly
the
figure
because
to
all
external
appearance
he
was
as
much
a
living
man
as
myself
and
yet
i
knew
the
thing
which
came
towards
me
was
not
flesh
and
blood
knew
it
when
i
stood
still
too
much
stupefied
to
feel
afraid
knew
it
as
the
figure
descended
swiftly
noiselessly
knew
it
as
for
one
instant
we
were
side
by
side
knew
it
when
i
put
out
my
hand
to
stop
its
progress
and
my
hand
encountering
nothing
passed
through
the
phantom
as
through
air
knew
it
when
i
saw
the
figure
pass
through
the
door
i
had
just
locked
and
which
opened
to
admit
the
ghostly
visitor
opened
wide
and
then
closed
again
without
the
help
of
mortal
hand
after
that
i
knew
nothing
more
till
i
came
to
my
senses
again
and
found
myself
half
lying
half
sitting
on
the
staircase
with
my
head
resting
against
the
banisters
i
had
fainted
but
if
any
man
thinks
i
saw
in
a
vision
what
i
have
described
let
him
wait
till
he
reaches
the
end
of
this
story
before
expressing
too
positive
an
opinion
about
the
matter
how
i
passed
the
remainder
of
that
night
i
could
scarcely
tell
towards
morning
however
i
fell
asleep
and
it
was
quite
late
when
i
awoke
so
late
in
fact
that
stott
had
rung
for
admittance
before
i
was
out
of
bed
that
morning
two
curious
things
occurred
one
the
postman
brought
a
letter
for
the
late
owner
of
river
hall
and
dropped
it
in
the
box
another
stott
asked
me
if
i
would
allow
her
and
two
of
the
children
to
take
up
their
residence
at
the
uninhabited
house
she
could
not
manage
to
pay
her
rent
she
explained
and
some
kind
friends
had
offered
to
maintain
the
elder
children
if
she
could
keep
the
two
youngest
and
i
thought
sir
seeing
how
many
spare
rooms
there
are
here
and
the
furniture
wanting
cleaning
and
the
windows
opening
when
the
sun
is
out
that
perhaps
you
would
not
object
to
my
staying
here
altogether
i
should
not
want
any
more
wages
sir
and
i
would
do
my
best
to
give
satisfaction
for
about
five
minutes
i
considered
this
proposition
made
to
me
whilst
sitting
at
breakfast
and
decided
in
favour
of
granting
her
request
i
felt
satisfied
she
was
not
in
league
with
the
person
or
persons
engaged
in
watching
my
movements
it
would
be
well
to
have
some
one
in
care
of
the
premises
during
my
absence
and
it
would
clearly
be
to
her
interest
to
keep
her
place
at
river
hall
if
possible
accordingly
when
she
brought
in
my
boots
i
told
her
she
could
remove
at
once
if
she
liked
only
remember
one
thing
stott
i
said
if
you
find
any
ghosts
in
the
dark
corners
you
must
not
come
to
me
with
any
complaints
i
sleep
sound
sir
she
answered
and
i
do
think
any
ghosts
will
trouble
me
in
the
daytime
so
thank
you
sir
i
will
bring
over
a
few
things
and
stay
here
if
you
please
very
good
here
is
the
key
of
the
back
door
i
answered
and
in
five
minutes
more
i
was
trudging
londonward
as
i
walked
along
i
decided
not
to
say
anything
to
craven
concerning
the
previous
night
adventures
first
because
i
felt
reluctant
to
mention
the
apparition
and
secondly
because
instinct
told
me
i
should
do
better
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
confide
in
no
one
till
i
had
obtained
some
clue
to
the
mystery
of
that
midnight
watcher
now
here
a
very
curious
thing
said
craven
after
he
had
opened
and
read
the
letter
left
at
river
hall
that
morning
this
is
from
a
man
who
has
evidently
not
heard
of
elmsdale
death
and
who
writes
to
say
how
much
he
regrets
having
been
obliged
to
leave
england
without
paying
his
i
o
u
held
by
my
client
to
show
that
though
he
may
have
seemed
dishonest
he
never
meant
to
cheat
elmsdale
he
encloses
a
draft
on
london
for
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
amount
due
very
creditable
to
him
i
remarked
what
is
the
amount
sir
oh
the
total
is
under
a
hundred
pounds
answered
craven
but
what
i
meant
by
saying
the
affair
seemed
curious
is
this
amongst
elmsdale
papers
there
was
not
an
i
o
u
of
any
description
well
that
is
singular
i
observed
then
asked
do
you
think
elmsdale
had
any
other
office
besides
the
library
at
river
hall
no
was
the
reply
none
whatever
when
he
gave
up
his
offices
in
town
he
moved
every
one
of
his
papers
to
river
hall
he
was
a
reserved
but
not
a
secret
man
not
a
man
for
instance
at
all
likely
to
lead
a
double
life
of
any
sort
and
yet
he
betted
i
suggested
certainly
that
does
puzzle
me
said
craven
and
it
is
all
against
my
statement
for
i
am
certain
no
human
being
unless
it
might
be
harringford
who
knew
him
in
business
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
what
is
your
theory
about
the
absence
of
documents
i
inquired
i
think
he
must
have
raised
money
on
them
answered
craven
are
you
aware
whether
anyone
else
ever
produced
them
i
asked
i
am
not
i
never
heard
of
their
being
produced
but
then
i
should
not
have
been
likely
to
hear
which
was
very
true
but
very
unsatisfactory
could
we
succeed
in
tracing
even
one
of
those
papers
a
clue
might
be
found
to
the
mystery
of
elmsdale
suicide
that
afternoon
i
repaired
to
the
house
of
one
of
our
clients
who
had
i
knew
a
file
of
the
newspapers
and
asked
him
to
allow
me
to
look
at
it
i
could
of
course
have
seen
a
file
at
many
places
in
the
city
but
i
preferred
pursuing
my
investigations
where
no
one
was
likely
to
watch
the
proceeding
bless
my
soul
yes
only
too
happy
to
be
able
to
oblige
craven
walk
into
the
study
there
is
a
good
fire
make
yourself
quite
at
home
i
beg
and
let
me
send
you
a
glass
of
wine
all
of
which
i
did
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
dear
old
gentleman
turning
over
the
file
for
the
especial
year
in
which
elmsdale
had
elected
to
put
a
pistol
to
his
head
i
found
at
last
the
account
of
the
inquest
which
i
copied
out
in
shorthand
to
be
able
to
digest
it
more
fully
at
leisure
and
as
it
was
growing
dusk
wended
my
way
back
to
buckingham
street
as
i
was
walking
slowly
down
one
side
of
the
street
i
noticed
a
man
standing
within
the
open
door
of
a
house
near
buckingham
gate
at
any
other
time
i
should
not
have
given
the
fact
a
second
thought
but
life
at
river
hall
seemed
to
have
endowed
me
with
the
power
of
making
mountains
out
of
molehills
of
regarding
the
commonest
actions
of
my
fellows
with
distrust
and
suspicion
and
i
was
determined
to
know
more
of
the
gentleman
who
stood
back
in
the
shadow
peering
out
into
the
darkening
twilight
with
this
object
i
ran
upstairs
to
the
clerk
office
and
then
passed
into
craven
room
he
had
gone
but
his
lamp
was
still
burning
and
i
took
care
to
move
between
it
and
the
window
so
as
to
show
myself
to
any
person
who
might
be
watching
outside
then
without
removing
hat
or
i
left
the
room
and
proceeded
to
taylor
office
which
i
found
in
utter
darkness
this
was
what
i
wanted
i
wished
to
see
without
being
seen
and
across
the
way
standing
now
on
the
pavement
was
the
man
i
had
noticed
looking
up
at
our
offices
all
right
thought
i
and
running
downstairs
i
went
out
again
and
walked
steadily
up
buckingham
street
along
john
street
up
adam
street
as
though
to
the
strand
before
however
i
reached
that
thoroughfare
i
paused
hesitated
and
then
immediately
and
suddenly
wheeled
round
and
retraced
my
steps
meeting
as
i
did
so
a
man
walking
a
few
yards
behind
me
and
at
about
the
same
pace
i
did
not
slacken
my
speed
for
a
moment
as
we
came
face
to
face
i
did
not
turn
to
look
back
after
him
i
retraced
my
steps
to
the
office
affected
to
look
out
some
paper
and
once
again
pursued
my
former
route
this
time
without
meeting
or
being
followed
by
anyone
and
made
my
way
into
the
city
where
i
really
had
business
to
transact
i
could
have
wished
for
a
longer
and
a
better
look
at
the
man
who
honoured
me
so
far
as
to
feel
interested
in
my
movements
but
i
did
not
wish
to
arouse
his
suspicions
i
had
scored
one
trick
i
had
met
him
full
and
seen
his
face
distinctly
so
distinctly
that
i
was
able
to
feel
certain
i
had
seen
it
before
but
where
at
the
moment
i
could
not
remember
never
mind
i
continued
that
memory
will
come
in
due
time
meanwhile
the
ground
of
inquiry
narrows
and
the
plot
begins
to
thicken
miss
blake
once
more
upon
my
return
to
river
hall
i
found
in
the
an
envelope
addressed
to
patterson
esq
thinking
it
probably
contained
some
circular
i
did
not
break
the
seal
until
after
dinner
whereas
had
i
only
known
from
whom
the
note
came
should
i
not
have
devoured
its
contents
before
satisfying
the
pangs
of
physical
hunger
thus
ran
the
epistle
dear
sir
until
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
ignorant
that
you
were
the
person
who
had
undertaken
to
reside
at
river
hall
if
you
would
add
another
obligation
to
that
already
conferred
upon
me
that
terrible
house
at
what
i
have
seen
in
it
you
know
what
may
happen
to
you
if
you
persist
in
remaining
there
i
tremble
to
think
for
the
sake
of
your
widowed
mother
and
only
sister
you
ought
not
to
expose
yourself
to
a
risk
which
is
than
i
never
wish
to
hear
of
river
hall
being
let
again
immediately
i
come
of
age
i
shall
sell
the
place
and
if
anything
could
give
me
happiness
in
this
world
it
would
be
to
hear
the
house
was
razed
to
the
ground
pray
pray
listen
to
a
warning
which
believe
me
is
not
idly
given
and
leave
a
place
which
has
already
been
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
to
yours
gratefully
and
sincerely
helena
elmsdale
it
is
no
part
of
this
story
to
tell
the
rapture
with
which
i
gazed
upon
the
writing
of
my
once
i
had
heard
miss
blake
remark
when
craven
was
remonstrating
with
her
on
her
hieroglyphics
that
halana
wrote
an
hand
like
all
the
rest
of
the
english
and
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
nothing
particularly
original
or
characteristic
about
miss
elmsdale
calligraphy
but
what
did
that
signify
to
me
if
she
had
strung
pearls
together
i
should
not
have
valued
them
so
much
as
i
did
the
dear
words
which
revealed
her
interest
in
me
over
and
over
i
read
the
note
at
first
rapturously
afterwards
with
a
second
feeling
mingling
with
my
joy
how
did
she
know
it
was
i
who
had
taken
up
my
residence
at
river
hall
not
a
soul
i
knew
in
london
besides
craven
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
he
had
promised
faithfully
to
keep
my
secret
where
then
had
miss
elmsdale
obtained
her
information
from
whom
had
she
learned
that
i
was
bent
on
solving
the
mystery
of
the
uninhabited
house
i
puzzled
myself
over
these
questions
till
my
brain
grew
uneasy
with
vain
conjectures
let
me
imagine
what
i
would
let
me
force
my
thoughts
into
what
grooves
i
might
the
moment
the
mental
pressure
was
removed
my
suspicions
fluttered
back
to
the
man
whose
face
seemed
not
unfamiliar
i
am
confident
he
wants
to
keep
that
house
vacant
i
decided
once
let
me
discover
who
he
is
and
the
mystery
of
the
shall
not
long
remain
a
mystery
but
then
the
trouble
chanced
to
be
how
to
find
out
who
he
was
i
could
not
watch
and
be
watched
at
the
same
time
and
i
did
not
wish
to
take
anyone
into
my
confidence
least
of
all
a
professional
detective
so
far
fortune
had
stood
my
friend
i
had
learnt
something
suspected
by
no
one
else
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
trust
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
for
further
information
on
the
subject
of
my
unknown
friend
when
craven
and
i
were
seated
at
our
respective
tables
i
said
to
him
could
you
make
any
excuse
to
send
me
to
miss
blake
sir
craven
looked
up
in
utter
amazement
to
miss
blake
he
repeated
why
do
you
want
to
go
there
i
want
to
see
miss
elmsdale
i
answered
quietly
enough
though
i
felt
the
colour
rising
in
my
face
as
i
spoke
you
had
better
put
all
that
nonsense
on
one
side
patterson
he
remarked
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
make
your
way
in
the
world
and
you
will
not
do
that
so
long
as
your
head
is
running
upon
pretty
girls
helena
elmsdale
is
a
good
girl
but
she
would
no
more
be
a
suitable
wife
for
you
than
you
would
be
a
suitable
husband
for
her
stick
to
law
my
lad
for
the
present
and
leave
love
for
those
who
have
nothing
more
important
to
think
of
i
did
not
want
to
see
miss
elmsdale
for
the
purpose
you
imply
i
said
smiling
at
the
vehemence
of
craven
advice
i
only
wish
to
ask
her
one
question
what
is
the
question
from
whom
she
learned
that
i
was
in
residence
at
river
hall
i
answered
after
a
moment
hesitation
what
makes
you
think
she
is
aware
of
that
fact
he
inquired
i
received
a
note
from
her
last
night
entreating
me
to
leave
the
place
and
intimating
that
some
vague
peril
menaced
me
if
i
persisted
in
remaining
there
poor
child
poor
helena
said
craven
thoughtfully
then
spreading
a
sheet
of
on
his
and
drawing
his
towards
him
he
proceeded
now
remember
patterson
i
trust
to
your
honour
implicitly
you
must
not
make
love
to
that
girl
i
think
a
man
can
scarcely
act
more
dishonourably
towards
a
woman
than
to
induce
her
to
enter
into
what
must
be
under
the
best
circumstances
a
very
long
engagement
you
may
trust
me
sir
i
answered
earnestly
not
i
added
that
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
easy
matter
to
make
love
to
anyone
with
miss
blake
sitting
by
craven
laughed
he
could
not
help
doing
so
at
the
idea
i
had
suggested
then
he
said
i
had
a
letter
from
miss
blake
this
morning
asking
me
for
money
and
you
are
going
to
let
her
have
some
of
that
hundred
pounds
you
intended
yesterday
to
place
against
her
indebtedness
to
you
i
suggested
that
is
so
he
replied
of
course
when
miss
helena
comes
of
age
we
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
we
really
must
to
this
i
made
no
reply
it
would
be
a
most
extraordinary
leaf
i
considered
in
which
miss
blake
did
not
appear
as
debtor
to
my
employer
but
it
scarcely
fell
within
my
province
to
influence
craven
actions
you
had
better
ask
miss
blake
to
acknowledge
receipt
of
this
said
my
principal
holding
up
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
as
he
spoke
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
kept
the
account
as
i
ought
to
have
done
which
was
undeniably
true
seeing
we
had
never
taken
a
receipt
from
her
at
all
and
that
loans
had
been
debited
to
his
private
account
instead
of
to
that
of
miss
blake
but
true
as
it
was
i
only
answered
that
i
would
get
her
acknowledgment
and
taking
my
hat
i
walked
off
to
hunter
street
arrived
there
i
found
to
my
unspeakable
joy
that
miss
blake
was
out
and
miss
elmsdale
at
home
when
i
entered
the
shabby
where
her
beauty
was
so
grievously
lodged
she
rose
and
greeted
me
with
kindly
words
and
sweet
smiles
and
vivid
blushes
you
have
come
to
tell
me
you
are
not
going
ever
again
to
that
dreadful
house
she
said
after
the
first
greeting
and
inquiries
for
miss
blake
were
over
you
can
not
tell
the
horror
with
which
the
mere
mention
of
river
hall
now
fills
me
i
hope
it
will
never
be
mentioned
to
you
again
till
i
have
solved
the
mystery
attached
to
it
i
answered
then
you
will
not
do
what
i
ask
she
cried
almost
despairingly
i
can
not
was
my
reply
miss
elmsdale
you
would
not
have
a
soldier
turn
back
from
the
battle
i
have
undertaken
to
find
out
the
secret
attached
to
your
old
home
and
please
god
i
shall
succeed
in
my
endeavours
but
you
are
exposing
yourself
to
danger
to
i
must
take
my
chance
of
that
i
can
not
if
i
would
turn
back
now
and
i
would
not
if
i
could
but
i
have
come
to
you
for
information
how
did
you
know
it
was
i
who
had
gone
to
river
hall
the
colour
flamed
up
in
her
face
as
i
put
the
question
i
i
was
told
so
she
stammered
out
may
i
ask
by
whom
no
patterson
you
may
not
she
replied
a
a
friend
a
kind
friend
informed
me
of
the
fact
and
spoke
of
the
perils
to
which
you
were
exposing
yourself
living
there
all
alone
all
alone
she
repeated
i
would
not
pass
a
night
in
the
house
again
if
the
whole
parish
were
there
to
keep
me
company
and
what
must
it
be
to
stay
in
that
terrible
terrible
place
alone
you
are
here
perhaps
because
you
do
not
believe
because
you
have
not
seen
i
do
believe
i
interrupted
because
i
have
seen
and
yet
i
mean
to
go
through
with
the
matter
to
the
end
have
you
a
likeness
of
your
father
in
your
possession
miss
elmsdale
i
asked
i
have
a
miniature
copied
from
his
portrait
which
was
of
course
too
large
to
carry
from
place
to
place
she
answered
why
do
you
wish
to
know
if
you
let
me
see
it
i
will
reply
to
your
question
i
said
round
her
dear
throat
she
wore
a
thin
gold
chain
unfastening
this
she
handed
to
me
the
necklet
to
which
was
attached
a
locket
enamelled
in
black
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
as
i
took
this
piece
of
personal
property
my
hand
trembled
so
much
that
i
could
not
open
the
case
true
love
is
always
bashful
and
i
loved
the
girl
whose
slender
neck
the
chain
had
caressed
so
madly
and
senselessly
if
you
will
that
i
felt
as
if
the
trinket
were
a
living
thing
a
part
and
parcel
of
herself
let
me
unfasten
it
she
said
unconscious
that
aught
save
awkwardness
affected
my
manipulation
of
the
spring
and
she
took
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
me
open
wet
with
tears
her
tears
judge
how
hard
it
was
for
me
then
to
keep
my
promise
to
craven
and
myself
how
hard
it
was
to
refrain
from
telling
her
all
my
reasons
for
having
ever
undertaken
to
fight
the
dragon
installed
at
river
hall
i
thank
god
i
did
refrain
had
i
spoken
then
had
i
presumed
upon
her
sorrow
and
her
simplicity
i
should
have
lost
something
which
constitutes
the
sweetest
memory
of
my
life
but
that
is
in
the
future
of
this
story
and
meantime
i
was
looking
at
the
face
of
her
father
i
looked
at
it
long
and
earnestly
then
i
closed
the
locket
softly
pressing
down
the
spring
as
i
did
so
and
gave
back
miniature
and
chain
into
her
hand
well
mr
patterson
she
said
inquiringly
can
you
bear
what
i
have
to
tell
i
asked
i
can
whatever
it
may
be
she
answered
i
have
seen
that
face
at
river
hall
she
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
i
went
on
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
i
am
destined
to
solve
the
mystery
of
its
appearance
she
covered
her
eyes
and
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
minute
when
i
said
can
you
give
me
the
name
of
the
person
who
told
you
i
was
at
river
hall
i
can
not
she
repeated
i
promised
not
to
mention
it
he
said
i
was
in
danger
yes
living
there
all
alone
and
he
wished
you
to
warn
me
no
he
asked
my
aunt
to
do
so
and
she
refused
and
so
i
i
thought
i
would
write
to
you
without
mentioning
the
matter
to
her
you
have
done
me
an
incalculable
service
i
remarked
and
in
return
i
will
tell
you
something
what
is
that
she
asked
from
i
shall
not
be
alone
in
the
house
oh
how
thankful
i
am
she
exclaimed
then
instantly
added
here
is
my
aunt
i
rose
as
miss
blake
entered
and
bowed
oh
it
is
you
is
it
said
the
lady
the
girl
told
me
some
one
was
waiting
hot
and
swift
ran
the
colour
to
my
adored
one
cheeks
aunt
she
observed
i
think
you
forget
this
gentleman
comes
from
mr
craven
oh
no
my
dear
i
do
forget
craven
or
his
clerks
either
responded
miss
blake
as
still
cloaked
and
bonneted
she
tore
open
craven
envelope
i
am
to
take
back
an
answer
i
think
said
i
you
are
i
see
she
answered
he
getting
mighty
particular
is
william
craven
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
am
going
to
cheat
him
out
of
his
paltry
ten
pounds
ten
pounds
indeed
and
what
is
that
i
should
like
to
know
to
us
in
our
present
straits
why
i
had
more
than
twice
ten
yesterday
from
a
man
on
whom
we
have
no
claim
none
whatever
who
without
asking
offered
it
in
our
need
aunt
said
miss
elmsdale
warningly
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
your
acknowledgment
miss
blake
i
should
like
to
be
getting
back
to
buckingham
street
i
said
craven
will
wonder
at
my
absence
not
a
bit
of
it
retorted
miss
blake
you
and
craven
understand
each
other
or
i
am
very
much
mistaken
but
here
is
the
receipt
and
good
day
to
you
i
should
have
merely
bowed
my
farewell
but
that
miss
elmsdale
stood
up
valiantly
patterson
she
said
holding
out
her
dainty
hand
and
letting
it
lie
in
mine
while
she
spoke
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
can
never
forget
what
you
have
done
and
dared
in
our
interests
and
i
went
out
of
the
room
and
descended
the
stairs
and
opened
the
front
door
she
looking
graciously
over
the
balusters
the
while
happy
ay
and
more
than
happy
what
would
i
not
have
done
and
dared
at
that
moment
for
helena
elmsdale
ah
ye
lovers
answer
help
there
has
been
a
gentleman
to
look
at
the
house
sir
this
afternoon
said
stott
to
me
when
wet
and
tired
i
arrived
a
few
evenings
after
my
interview
with
miss
elmsdale
at
river
hall
to
look
at
the
house
i
repeated
why
it
is
not
to
let
i
know
that
sir
but
he
brought
an
order
from
craven
office
to
allow
him
to
see
over
the
place
and
to
show
him
all
about
for
a
widow
lady
from
the
country
he
said
he
wanted
it
a
very
nice
gentleman
sir
only
he
did
ask
a
lot
of
questions
surely
what
sort
of
questions
i
inquired
oh
as
to
why
the
tenants
did
not
stop
here
and
if
i
thought
there
was
anything
queer
about
the
place
and
he
asked
how
you
liked
it
and
how
long
you
were
going
to
stay
and
if
you
had
ever
seen
aught
strange
in
the
house
he
spoke
about
you
sir
as
if
he
knew
you
quite
well
and
said
you
must
be
to
come
and
fight
the
ghosts
all
by
yourself
a
mighty
civil
talkative
gentleman
asked
me
if
i
felt
afraid
of
living
here
and
whether
i
had
ever
met
any
spirits
walking
about
the
stairs
and
passages
by
themselves
did
he
leave
the
order
you
spoke
of
just
now
behind
him
yes
sir
he
wanted
me
to
give
it
back
to
him
but
i
said
i
must
keep
it
for
you
to
see
so
then
he
laughed
and
made
the
remark
that
he
supposed
if
he
brought
the
lady
to
see
the
place
i
would
let
him
in
again
a
gentleman
sir
gave
me
a
shilling
though
i
told
him
i
did
not
require
it
meantime
i
was
reading
the
order
written
by
taylor
and
dated
two
years
back
what
sort
of
looking
man
was
he
i
asked
well
sir
there
was
not
anything
particular
about
him
in
any
way
not
a
tall
gentleman
not
near
so
tall
as
you
sir
getting
into
years
but
still
very
active
and
though
with
something
of
a
halt
in
his
way
of
walking
i
could
not
rightly
make
out
what
it
was
nor
what
it
was
that
caused
him
to
look
a
little
crooked
when
you
saw
him
from
behind
very
lean
sir
looked
as
if
the
dinners
he
had
eaten
done
him
no
good
seemed
as
if
for
all
his
pleasant
ways
he
must
have
seen
trouble
his
face
was
so
did
he
say
if
he
thought
the
house
would
suit
i
inquired
he
said
it
was
a
very
nice
house
sir
and
that
he
imagined
anybody
not
afraid
of
ghosts
might
spend
two
thousand
a
year
in
it
very
comfortably
he
said
he
should
bring
the
lady
to
see
the
place
and
asked
me
particularly
if
i
was
always
at
hand
in
case
he
should
come
tolerably
early
in
the
morning
oh
was
my
comment
and
i
walked
into
the
wondering
what
the
meaning
of
this
new
move
might
be
for
stott
had
described
to
the
best
of
her
ability
the
man
who
stood
watching
our
offices
in
london
and
good
heavens
yes
the
man
i
had
encountered
in
the
lane
leading
to
river
hall
when
i
went
to
the
uninhabited
house
after
colonel
morris
departure
that
is
the
man
thought
i
and
he
has
some
close
and
deep
and
secret
interest
in
the
mystery
associated
with
this
place
the
origin
of
which
i
must
discover
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
i
went
to
bed
for
i
had
caught
a
bad
cold
and
was
aching
from
head
to
foot
and
had
been
sleeping
ill
and
hoped
to
secure
a
good
night
rest
i
slept
it
is
true
but
as
for
rest
i
might
as
well
or
better
have
been
awake
i
fell
from
one
dream
into
another
found
myself
wandering
through
impossible
places
started
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
then
dozed
again
only
to
plunge
into
some
deeper
quagmire
of
trouble
and
through
all
there
was
a
vague
feeling
i
was
pursuing
a
person
who
eluded
all
my
efforts
to
find
him
playing
a
terrible
game
of
with
a
man
who
always
slipped
away
from
my
touch
panting
up
mountains
and
running
down
declivities
after
one
who
had
better
wind
and
faster
legs
than
i
peering
out
into
the
darkness
to
catch
a
sight
of
a
vague
figure
standing
somewhere
in
the
shadow
and
looking
with
the
sun
streaming
into
my
eyes
and
blinding
me
adown
long
white
roads
filled
with
a
multitude
of
people
straining
my
sight
to
catch
a
sight
of
the
coming
traveller
who
yet
never
came
when
i
awoke
thoroughly
as
i
did
long
and
long
before
daybreak
i
knew
i
was
ill
i
had
a
bad
sore
throat
and
an
oppression
at
my
chest
which
made
me
feel
as
if
i
was
breathing
through
a
sponge
my
limbs
ached
more
than
had
been
the
case
on
the
previous
evening
whilst
my
head
felt
heavier
than
a
log
of
teak
what
should
i
do
if
i
were
to
have
a
bad
illness
in
that
house
i
wondered
to
myself
and
for
a
few
minutes
i
pondered
over
the
expediency
of
returning
home
but
this
idea
was
soon
set
aside
where
could
i
go
that
the
uninhabited
house
would
not
be
a
haunting
presence
i
had
tried
running
away
from
it
once
before
and
found
it
more
real
to
me
in
the
king
road
brighton
than
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
no
ill
or
well
i
would
stay
on
the
very
first
night
of
my
absence
might
be
the
night
of
possible
explanation
having
so
decided
i
dressed
and
proceeded
to
the
office
remaining
there
however
only
long
enough
to
write
a
note
to
craven
saying
i
had
a
very
bad
cold
and
begging
him
to
excuse
my
attendance
after
that
i
turned
my
steps
to
munro
lodgings
if
it
were
possible
to
avert
an
illness
i
had
no
desire
to
become
invalided
in
elmsdale
hall
fortunately
munro
was
at
home
and
at
dinner
just
come
in
time
old
fellow
he
said
cheerily
it
is
not
one
day
in
a
dozen
you
would
have
found
me
here
at
this
hour
sit
down
and
have
some
steak
eat
why
what
the
matter
man
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
got
another
nervous
attack
if
you
have
i
declare
i
shall
lodge
a
complaint
against
you
with
mr
craven
i
am
not
nervous
i
answered
but
i
have
caught
cold
and
i
want
you
to
put
me
to
rights
wait
till
i
have
finished
my
dinner
he
replied
and
then
he
proceeded
to
cut
himself
another
piece
of
steak
having
demolished
which
and
seen
cheese
placed
on
the
table
he
said
now
harry
we
get
to
business
if
you
please
where
is
this
cold
you
were
talking
about
i
explained
as
well
as
i
could
and
he
listened
to
me
without
interruption
when
i
had
quite
finished
he
said
hal
patterson
you
are
either
becoming
a
hypochondriac
or
you
are
treating
me
to
half
confidences
your
cold
is
not
worth
speaking
about
go
home
and
get
to
bed
and
take
a
basin
of
gruel
or
a
glass
of
something
hot
after
you
are
in
bed
and
your
cold
will
be
well
in
the
morning
but
there
is
something
more
than
a
cold
the
matter
with
you
what
has
come
to
you
to
make
a
few
rheumatic
pains
and
a
slight
sore
throat
seem
of
consequence
in
your
eyes
i
am
afraid
of
being
ill
i
answered
why
are
you
afraid
of
being
ill
why
do
you
imagine
you
are
going
to
be
ill
why
should
you
fall
ill
any
more
than
anybody
else
i
sat
silent
for
a
minute
then
i
said
ned
if
i
tell
you
will
you
promise
upon
your
honour
not
to
laugh
at
me
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
i
do
fancy
i
shall
feel
inclined
to
laugh
he
replied
and
unless
i
give
you
permission
you
will
not
repeat
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
to
anyone
that
i
can
safely
promise
he
said
go
on
and
i
went
on
i
began
at
the
beginning
and
recited
all
the
events
chronicled
in
the
preceding
pages
and
he
listened
asking
no
questions
interposing
no
remark
when
i
ceased
speaking
he
rose
and
said
he
must
think
over
the
statements
i
had
made
i
will
come
and
look
you
up
patterson
he
observed
go
home
to
river
hall
and
keep
yourself
quiet
do
mention
that
you
feel
let
matters
go
on
as
usual
i
will
be
with
you
about
nine
i
have
an
appointment
now
that
i
must
keep
before
nine
munro
appeared
hearty
healthy
vigorous
as
usual
if
this
place
were
in
russell
square
he
said
after
a
hasty
glance
round
the
i
should
not
mind
taking
a
lease
of
it
at
forty
pounds
a
year
even
if
ghosts
were
included
in
the
fixtures
i
see
you
place
no
credence
in
my
story
i
said
a
little
stiffly
i
place
every
credence
in
your
story
was
the
reply
i
believe
you
believe
it
and
that
is
saying
more
than
most
people
could
say
nowadays
about
their
friends
stories
if
they
spoke
the
truth
it
was
of
no
use
for
me
to
express
any
further
opinion
upon
the
matter
i
felt
if
i
talked
for
a
thousand
years
i
should
still
fail
to
convince
my
listener
there
was
anything
supernatural
in
the
appearances
beheld
at
river
hall
it
is
so
easy
to
another
man
tale
it
is
pleasant
to
explain
every
phenomenon
that
the
speaker
has
never
witnessed
it
is
so
hard
to
credit
that
anything
absolutely
unaccountable
on
natural
grounds
has
been
witnessed
by
your
dearest
friend
that
knowing
my
only
chance
of
keeping
my
temper
and
preventing
munro
gaining
a
victory
over
me
was
to
maintain
a
discreet
silence
i
let
him
talk
on
and
strive
to
account
for
the
appearances
i
had
witnessed
in
his
own
way
your
acquaintance
of
the
halting
gait
and
high
shoulder
may
or
might
have
some
hand
in
the
affair
he
finished
my
own
opinion
is
he
has
not
the
notion
that
you
are
being
watched
is
if
my
view
of
the
matter
be
correct
only
a
further
development
of
the
nervous
excitement
which
has
played
you
all
sort
of
fantastic
tricks
since
you
came
to
this
house
if
anyone
does
wander
through
the
gardens
i
should
set
him
down
as
a
monomaniac
or
an
intending
burglar
and
in
any
case
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
pack
up
your
traps
and
leave
river
hall
to
its
fate
i
did
not
answer
indeed
i
felt
too
sick
at
heart
to
do
so
what
he
said
was
what
other
people
would
say
if
i
could
not
evolve
some
clearer
theory
than
i
had
yet
been
able
to
hit
on
i
should
be
compelled
to
leave
the
mystery
of
river
hall
just
as
i
had
found
it
miss
blake
had
i
knew
written
to
craven
that
the
house
had
better
be
let
again
as
there
was
no
use
in
his
keeping
a
clerk
there
in
free
lodgings
for
ever
and
now
came
ned
munro
with
his
worldly
wisdom
to
assure
me
mine
was
a
chase
and
that
the
only
sensible
course
for
me
to
pursue
was
to
abandon
it
altogether
for
the
first
time
i
felt
disheartened
about
the
business
and
i
suppose
i
showed
my
disappointment
for
munro
drawing
his
chair
nearer
to
me
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
cheer
up
harry
never
look
so
downhearted
because
your
nervous
system
has
been
playing
you
false
it
was
a
plucky
thing
to
do
and
to
carry
out
but
you
have
suffered
enough
for
honour
and
i
should
not
continue
the
experiment
of
trying
how
much
you
can
suffer
were
i
in
your
shoes
you
are
very
kind
munro
i
answered
but
i
can
not
give
up
if
i
had
all
the
wish
in
the
world
to
leave
here
a
will
stronger
than
my
own
would
bring
me
back
here
the
place
haunts
me
believe
me
i
suffer
less
from
its
influence
seated
in
this
room
than
when
i
am
in
the
office
or
walking
along
the
strand
upon
the
same
principle
i
suppose
that
a
murderer
always
carries
the
memory
of
his
victim
face
about
with
him
though
he
may
have
felt
callously
indifferent
whilst
the
body
was
an
actual
presence
precisely
i
agreed
but
then
my
dear
fellow
you
are
not
a
murderer
in
any
sense
of
the
word
you
did
not
create
the
ghosts
supposed
to
be
resident
here
no
but
i
feel
bound
to
find
out
who
did
i
answered
that
is
if
you
can
i
suppose
he
suggested
i
feel
certain
i
shall
was
the
answer
i
have
an
idea
in
my
mind
but
it
wants
shape
there
is
a
mystery
i
am
convinced
to
solve
which
only
the
merest
hint
is
needed
there
are
a
good
many
things
in
this
world
in
the
same
position
i
should
say
answered
munro
however
patterson
we
wo
argue
about
the
matter
only
there
is
one
thing
upon
which
i
am
determined
after
this
evening
i
will
come
and
stay
here
every
night
i
can
say
i
am
going
to
sleep
out
of
town
then
if
there
are
ghosts
we
can
hunt
them
together
if
there
are
none
we
shall
rest
all
the
better
do
you
agree
to
that
and
he
held
out
his
hand
which
i
clasped
in
mine
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
and
relief
impossible
to
describe
as
he
said
i
had
done
enough
for
honour
but
still
i
could
not
give
up
and
here
was
the
support
and
help
i
required
so
urgently
ready
for
my
need
i
am
so
much
obliged
i
said
at
last
pooh
nonsense
he
answered
you
would
do
as
much
or
more
for
me
any
day
there
do
let
us
get
sentimental
you
must
not
come
out
but
following
the
example
of
your
gallant
colonel
morris
i
will
if
you
please
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
garden
the
moon
must
be
up
by
this
time
i
drew
back
the
curtains
and
unfastened
the
shutter
which
offered
egress
to
the
grounds
then
having
rung
for
stott
to
remove
the
i
sat
down
by
the
fire
to
await
munro
return
and
began
musing
concerning
the
hopelessness
of
my
position
the
gulf
of
poverty
and
prejudice
and
struggle
that
lay
between
helena
and
myself
i
was
determined
to
win
her
but
the
prize
seemed
unattainable
as
the
lord
mayor
robes
must
have
appeared
to
whittington
when
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
highgate
hill
and
prostrated
as
i
was
by
that
subtle
malady
to
which
as
yet
munro
had
given
no
name
the
difficulties
grew
into
mountains
the
chances
of
success
dwarfed
themselves
into
molehills
whilst
thus
thinking
vaguely
purposelessly
but
still
most
miserably
i
was
aroused
from
reverie
by
the
noise
of
a
door
being
shut
cautiously
and
carefully
an
outer
door
and
yet
one
with
the
sound
of
which
i
was
unacquainted
hurrying
across
the
hall
i
flung
the
wide
and
looked
out
into
the
night
there
was
sufficient
moonlight
to
have
enabled
me
to
discern
any
object
moving
up
or
down
the
lane
but
not
a
creature
was
in
sight
not
a
cat
or
dog
even
traversed
the
weird
whiteness
of
that
lonely
thoroughfare
despite
munro
dictum
i
passed
out
into
the
night
air
and
went
down
to
the
very
banks
of
the
thames
there
was
not
a
boat
within
hail
the
nearest
barge
lay
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
as
i
retraced
my
steps
i
paused
involuntarily
beside
the
door
which
led
by
a
separate
entrance
to
the
library
that
is
the
door
which
shut
i
said
to
myself
pressing
my
hand
gently
along
the
lintel
and
sweeping
the
hitherto
unbroken
cobwebs
away
as
i
did
so
if
my
nerves
are
playing
me
false
this
time
the
sooner
their
tricks
are
stopped
the
better
for
no
human
being
opened
this
door
no
living
creature
has
passed
through
it
having
made
up
my
mind
on
which
points
i
the
house
and
walked
into
the
where
munro
pale
as
death
stood
draining
a
glass
of
neat
brandy
what
is
the
matter
i
cried
hurriedly
what
have
you
seen
what
let
me
alone
for
awhile
he
interrupted
speaking
in
a
thick
hoarse
whisper
then
immediately
asked
is
that
the
library
with
the
windows
nearest
the
river
yes
i
answered
i
want
to
go
into
that
room
he
said
still
in
the
same
tone
not
now
i
entreated
sit
down
and
compose
yourself
we
will
go
into
it
if
you
like
before
you
leave
now
now
this
minute
he
persisted
i
tell
you
patterson
i
must
see
what
is
in
it
attempting
no
further
opposition
i
lit
a
couple
of
candles
and
giving
one
into
his
hand
led
the
way
to
the
door
of
the
library
which
i
unlocked
and
flung
wide
open
to
one
particular
part
munro
directed
his
steps
casting
the
light
from
his
candle
on
the
carpet
peering
around
in
search
of
something
he
hoped
and
yet
still
feared
to
see
then
he
went
to
the
shutters
and
examined
the
fastenings
and
finding
all
well
secured
made
a
sign
for
me
to
precede
him
out
of
the
room
at
the
door
he
paused
and
took
one
more
look
into
the
darkness
of
the
apartment
after
which
he
waited
while
i
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
accompanying
me
back
across
the
hall
when
we
were
once
more
in
the
i
renewed
my
inquiry
as
to
what
he
had
seen
but
he
bade
me
let
him
alone
and
sat
mopping
great
beads
of
perspiration
off
his
forehead
till
unable
to
endure
the
mystery
any
longer
i
said
munro
whatever
it
may
be
that
you
have
seen
tell
me
all
i
entreat
any
certainty
will
be
better
than
the
possibilities
i
shall
be
conjuring
up
for
myself
he
looked
at
me
wearily
and
then
drawing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
if
trying
to
clear
his
vision
he
answered
with
an
uneasy
laugh
it
was
nonsense
of
course
i
did
not
think
i
was
so
imaginative
but
i
declare
i
fancied
i
saw
looking
through
the
windows
of
that
now
utterly
dark
room
a
man
lying
dead
on
the
floor
did
you
hear
a
door
shut
i
inquired
distinctly
he
answered
and
what
is
more
i
saw
a
shadow
flitting
through
the
other
door
leading
out
of
the
library
which
we
found
if
you
remember
bolted
on
the
inside
and
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
all
this
either
that
some
one
is
in
a
to
me
unintelligible
way
playing
a
very
clever
game
at
river
hall
or
else
that
i
am
mad
you
are
no
more
mad
than
other
people
who
have
lived
in
this
house
i
answered
i
do
know
how
you
have
done
it
patterson
he
went
on
unheeding
my
remark
i
do
upon
my
soul
know
how
you
managed
to
stay
on
here
it
would
have
driven
many
a
fellow
out
of
his
mind
i
do
not
like
leaving
you
i
wish
i
had
told
my
landlady
i
should
not
be
back
i
will
after
this
time
but
i
am
afraid
some
patient
may
be
wanting
me
my
dear
fellow
i
answered
the
affair
is
new
to
you
but
it
is
not
new
to
me
i
would
rather
sleep
alone
in
the
haunted
house
than
in
a
mansion
filled
from
basement
to
garret
with
the
unsolved
mystery
of
this
place
haunting
me
i
wish
you
had
never
heard
of
nor
seen
nor
come
near
it
he
exclaimed
bitterly
but
however
let
matters
turn
out
as
they
will
i
mean
to
stick
to
you
patterson
there
my
hand
on
it
and
he
gave
me
his
hand
which
was
cold
as
ice
cold
as
that
of
one
dead
i
am
going
to
have
some
punch
ned
i
remarked
that
is
if
you
will
stop
and
have
some
all
right
he
answered
something
and
strong
will
hurt
neither
of
us
but
you
ought
to
have
yours
in
bed
may
i
give
it
to
you
there
nonsense
i
exclaimed
and
we
drew
our
chairs
close
to
the
fire
and
under
the
influence
of
a
decoction
which
ned
insisted
upon
making
himself
and
at
making
which
indeed
he
was
much
more
of
an
adept
than
i
we
talked
valiantly
about
ghosts
and
their
doings
and
about
how
our
credit
and
happiness
were
bound
up
in
finding
out
the
reason
why
the
uninhabited
house
was
haunted
depend
upon
it
hal
said
munro
putting
on
his
coat
and
hat
preparatory
to
taking
his
departure
depend
upon
it
that
unfortunate
robert
elmsdale
must
have
been
badly
cheated
by
some
one
and
sorely
exercised
in
spirit
before
he
blew
out
his
brains
to
this
remark
which
remembering
what
he
had
said
in
the
middle
of
the
day
showed
the
wonderful
difference
that
exists
between
theory
and
practice
i
made
no
reply
unconsciously
almost
a
theory
had
been
forming
in
my
own
mind
but
i
felt
much
corroboration
of
its
possibility
must
be
obtained
before
i
dare
give
it
expression
nevertheless
it
had
taken
such
hold
of
me
that
i
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
which
was
surely
though
slowly
gaining
ground
even
against
the
dictates
of
my
better
judgment
i
will
just
read
over
the
account
of
the
inquest
once
again
i
decided
as
i
bolted
and
barred
the
chain
after
munro
departure
and
so
by
way
of
ending
the
night
pleasantly
i
took
out
the
report
and
studied
it
till
two
chiming
from
a
neighbouring
church
reminded
me
that
the
fire
was
out
that
i
had
a
bad
cold
and
that
i
ought
to
have
been
between
the
blankets
and
asleep
hours
previously
light
at
last
now
whether
it
was
owing
to
having
gone
out
the
evening
before
from
a
very
warm
room
into
the
night
air
and
afterwards
into
that
chilly
library
or
to
having
sat
reading
the
report
given
about
elmsdale
death
till
i
grew
chilled
to
my
very
marrow
i
can
not
say
all
i
know
is
that
when
i
awoke
next
morning
i
felt
very
ill
and
welcomed
with
rejoicing
of
spirit
ned
munro
who
arrived
about
and
at
once
declared
he
had
come
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
me
in
the
uninhabited
house
i
have
arranged
it
all
got
a
friend
to
take
charge
of
my
patients
stated
that
i
am
going
to
pay
a
visit
in
the
country
and
so
forth
and
now
how
are
you
i
told
him
very
truthfully
that
i
did
not
feel
at
all
well
then
you
will
have
to
get
well
or
else
we
shall
never
be
able
to
fathom
this
business
he
said
the
first
thing
consequently
i
shall
do
is
to
write
a
prescription
and
get
it
made
up
after
that
i
mean
to
take
a
survey
of
the
house
and
grounds
do
precisely
what
you
like
i
answered
this
is
liberty
hall
to
the
living
as
well
as
to
the
dead
and
i
laid
my
head
on
the
back
of
the
and
went
off
to
sleep
all
that
day
munro
seemed
to
feel
little
need
of
my
society
he
examined
every
room
in
the
house
and
every
square
inch
about
the
premises
he
took
short
walks
round
the
adjacent
neighbourhood
and
made
to
his
own
satisfaction
a
map
of
river
hall
and
the
country
and
town
thereunto
adjoining
then
he
had
a
great
fire
lighted
in
the
library
and
spent
the
afternoon
tapping
the
walls
trying
the
floors
and
trying
to
obtain
enlightenment
from
the
passage
which
led
from
the
library
direct
to
the
door
opening
into
the
lane
after
dinner
he
asked
me
to
lend
him
the
shorthand
report
i
had
made
of
the
evidence
given
at
the
inquest
he
made
no
comment
upon
it
when
he
finished
reading
but
sat
for
a
few
minutes
with
one
hand
shading
his
eyes
and
the
other
busily
engaged
in
making
some
sort
of
a
sketch
on
the
back
of
an
old
letter
what
are
you
doing
munro
i
asked
at
last
you
shall
see
presently
he
answered
without
looking
up
or
pausing
in
his
occupation
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
he
handed
me
over
the
paper
saying
do
you
know
anyone
that
resembles
i
took
the
sketch
looked
at
it
and
cried
out
incoherently
in
my
surprise
well
he
went
on
who
is
it
the
man
who
follows
me
the
man
i
saw
in
this
lane
and
what
is
his
name
that
is
precisely
what
i
desire
to
find
out
i
answered
when
did
you
see
him
how
did
you
identify
him
why
did
i
have
something
to
tell
you
if
you
will
only
be
quiet
and
let
me
speak
he
interrupted
it
was
as
you
know
late
last
night
before
i
left
here
and
for
that
reason
and
also
because
i
was
perplexed
and
troubled
i
walked
fast
faster
than
even
is
my
wont
the
road
was
very
lonely
i
scarcely
met
a
creature
along
the
road
flooded
with
the
moonlight
i
never
was
out
on
a
lovelier
night
i
had
never
even
in
the
country
felt
i
had
it
so
entirely
to
myself
every
here
and
there
i
came
within
sight
of
the
river
and
it
seemed
on
each
occasion
as
though
a
great
mirror
had
been
put
up
to
make
every
object
on
land
every
house
every
tree
bush
fern
more
clearly
visible
than
it
had
been
before
i
am
coming
to
my
story
hal
so
look
so
impatient
at
last
as
i
came
once
again
in
view
of
the
thames
with
the
moon
reflected
in
the
water
and
the
dark
arches
of
the
bridge
looking
black
and
solemn
contrasted
against
the
silvery
stream
i
saw
before
me
a
long
way
before
me
a
man
whose
figure
stood
out
in
relief
against
the
white
road
a
man
walking
wearily
and
with
evident
difficulty
a
man
too
slightly
deformed
i
walked
on
rapidly
till
within
about
a
score
yards
of
him
then
i
slackened
my
speed
and
taking
care
that
my
leisurely
footsteps
should
be
heard
overtook
him
by
degrees
and
then
when
i
was
quite
abreast
asked
if
he
could
oblige
me
with
a
light
he
looked
up
in
my
face
and
said
with
a
forced
painful
smile
and
studied
courtesy
of
manner
am
sorry
sir
to
say
that
i
do
not
smoke
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
reply
i
made
i
know
his
countenance
struck
me
so
forcibly
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
utter
some
commonplace
remark
concerning
the
beauty
of
the
night
do
not
like
moonlight
he
said
and
as
he
said
it
something
a
connection
of
ideas
or
a
momentary
speculation
came
upon
me
so
suddenly
that
once
again
i
failed
to
reply
coherently
but
asked
if
he
could
tell
me
the
shortest
way
to
the
brompton
road
which
end
he
inquired
nearest
hyde
park
corner
i
answered
as
it
turned
out
no
question
could
have
served
my
purpose
better
am
going
part
of
the
way
there
he
said
will
show
you
the
nearest
route
that
is
he
added
you
can
accommodate
your
pace
to
mine
and
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
to
his
right
foot
which
evidently
was
causing
him
considerable
pain
now
that
was
something
quite
in
my
way
and
by
degrees
i
got
him
to
tell
me
about
the
accident
which
had
caused
his
slight
deformity
i
told
him
i
was
a
doctor
and
had
been
to
see
a
patient
and
so
led
him
on
to
talk
about
sickness
and
disease
till
at
length
he
touched
upon
diseases
of
a
morbid
character
asking
me
if
it
were
true
that
in
some
special
maladies
the
patient
was
haunted
by
an
apparition
which
appeared
at
a
particular
hour
i
told
him
it
was
quite
true
and
that
such
cases
were
peculiarly
distressing
and
generally
proved
most
difficult
to
cure
mentioning
several
instances
which
i
do
not
mean
to
detail
to
you
patterson
as
i
know
you
have
an
aversion
to
anything
savouring
of
medical
shop
doctors
do
not
believe
in
the
actual
existence
of
any
such
apparitions
of
course
he
remarked
after
a
pause
i
told
him
we
did
not
that
we
knew
they
had
their
rise
and
origin
solely
in
the
malady
of
the
patient
yet
he
said
ghost
stories
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
those
associated
with
disease
are
very
extraordinary
unaccountable
extraordinary
no
doubt
i
answered
i
should
hesitate
before
saying
unaccountable
now
there
is
that
river
hall
place
up
the
river
there
must
be
some
rational
way
of
explaining
the
appearances
in
that
house
though
no
one
has
yet
found
any
clue
to
that
enigma
hall
where
is
that
he
asked
then
suddenly
added
i
remember
now
you
mean
the
uninhabited
house
as
it
is
called
yes
there
is
a
curious
story
if
you
like
may
i
ask
if
you
are
interested
in
any
way
in
that
matter
in
any
way
except
that
i
have
been
spending
the
evening
there
with
a
friend
of
mine
he
seen
anything
of
the
reputed
ghost
asked
my
companion
eagerly
he
able
to
throw
any
light
on
the
dark
subject
do
think
he
can
i
replied
has
seen
the
usual
appearances
which
i
believe
it
is
correct
to
see
at
river
hall
but
so
far
they
have
added
nothing
to
his
previous
knowledge
has
seen
you
say
all
the
orthodox
lions
of
that
cheerful
house
still
he
is
not
daunted
he
is
not
afraid
is
not
afraid
honestly
putting
ghosts
entirely
on
one
side
i
should
not
care
to
be
in
his
shoes
all
alone
in
a
lonely
house
you
would
be
right
sir
was
the
answer
man
must
be
mad
to
run
such
a
risk
i
told
him
i
agreed
i
would
not
stay
in
that
house
alone
for
any
money
which
could
be
offered
to
me
he
went
on
eagerly
can
not
go
so
far
as
that
i
said
still
it
must
be
a
very
large
sum
which
could
induce
me
to
do
so
ought
to
be
pulled
down
sir
he
continued
walls
ought
to
be
razed
to
the
ground
suppose
they
will
i
answered
miss
elmsdale
the
owner
comes
of
age
unless
indeed
our
modern
don
quixote
runs
the
ghost
to
earth
before
that
time
you
say
the
young
man
was
ill
asked
my
companion
has
got
a
cold
i
answered
colds
are
nasty
things
to
get
rid
of
he
commented
in
those
localities
that
is
a
most
unhealthy
part
you
ought
to
order
your
patient
a
thorough
change
of
air
have
but
he
wo
take
advice
was
my
reply
has
nailed
his
colours
to
the
mast
and
means
i
believe
to
stay
in
river
hall
till
he
kills
the
ghost
or
the
ghost
kills
him
a
foolish
youth
but
then
youth
is
generally
foolish
and
we
have
all
our
crotchets
we
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
by
this
time
and
saying
his
road
lay
in
an
opposite
direction
to
mine
the
gentleman
i
have
sketched
told
me
the
nearest
way
to
take
and
bade
me
a
civil
good
night
adding
suppose
i
ought
to
say
good
morning
and
is
that
all
i
asked
as
munro
paused
bide
a
wee
as
the
scotch
say
my
son
i
strode
off
along
the
road
he
indicated
and
then
instead
of
making
the
detour
he
had
kindly
sketched
out
for
my
benefit
chose
the
first
turning
to
my
left
and
quite
convinced
he
would
soon
pass
that
way
took
up
my
position
in
the
portico
of
a
house
which
lay
well
in
shadow
it
stood
a
little
back
from
the
and
a
poor
little
arab
sleeping
on
the
stone
step
proved
to
me
the
policeman
was
not
over
and
above
vigilant
in
that
neighbourhood
i
waited
heaven
only
knows
how
long
thinking
all
the
time
i
must
be
mistaken
and
that
his
home
did
lie
in
the
direction
he
took
but
at
last
looking
out
between
the
pillars
and
the
concealing
shrubs
i
saw
him
he
was
looking
eagerly
into
the
distance
with
such
a
drawn
worn
painful
expression
that
for
a
moment
my
heart
relented
and
i
thought
i
would
let
the
poor
devil
go
in
peace
it
was
only
for
a
moment
however
touching
the
sleeping
boy
i
bade
him
awake
if
he
wanted
to
earn
a
shilling
that
gentleman
in
sight
and
get
to
know
for
me
where
he
lives
and
come
back
here
and
i
will
give
you
a
shilling
and
perhaps
two
for
your
pains
with
his
eyes
still
heavy
with
slumber
and
his
perceptions
for
the
moment
dulled
he
sped
after
the
figure
limping
wearily
on
i
saw
him
ask
my
late
companion
for
charity
and
follow
the
gentleman
for
a
few
steps
when
the
latter
threatening
him
with
his
stick
the
boy
dodged
to
escape
a
blow
and
then
by
way
of
showing
how
lightly
his
load
sat
upon
him
began
turning
wheels
down
the
middle
of
the
street
he
passed
the
place
where
i
stood
and
spun
a
hundred
feet
further
on
then
he
gathered
himself
together
and
seeing
no
one
in
sight
stealthily
crept
back
to
his
porch
again
young
rascal
i
said
told
you
to
follow
him
home
i
want
to
know
his
name
and
address
particularly
along
then
he
answered
i
show
you
bless
you
we
all
knows
him
better
than
we
do
the
police
or
anybody
hereabouts
he
a
beak
and
a
ward
up
at
the
church
whatever
that
is
and
he
has
as
big
oh
as
big
as
two
workhouses
and
his
name
munro
his
name
i
gasped
harringford
i
expected
it
i
knew
then
that
for
days
and
weeks
my
suspicions
had
been
vaguely
connecting
harringford
with
the
mystery
of
the
uninhabited
house
this
was
the
hiding
figure
in
my
dream
the
link
hitherto
wanting
in
my
reveries
concerning
river
hall
i
had
been
looking
for
this
waiting
for
it
i
understood
at
last
and
yet
when
munro
mentioned
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
watch
my
movements
i
shrunk
from
the
conclusion
which
forced
itself
upon
me
must
we
go
on
to
the
end
with
this
affair
i
asked
after
a
pause
and
my
voice
was
so
changed
it
sounded
like
that
of
a
stranger
to
me
we
do
not
yet
know
what
the
end
will
prove
munro
answered
but
whatever
it
may
be
we
must
not
turn
back
now
how
ought
we
to
act
do
you
think
i
inquired
we
ought
not
to
act
at
all
he
answered
we
had
better
wait
and
see
what
his
next
move
will
be
he
is
certain
to
take
some
step
he
will
try
to
get
you
out
of
this
house
by
hook
or
by
crook
he
has
already
striven
to
effect
his
purpose
through
miss
elmsdale
and
failed
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
for
him
to
attempt
some
other
scheme
it
is
not
for
me
to
decide
on
the
course
he
is
likely
to
pursue
but
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
stay
within
doors
at
night
i
should
not
sit
in
the
dark
near
windows
still
unshuttered
i
should
not
allow
any
strangers
to
enter
the
house
and
i
should
have
a
couple
of
good
dogs
running
loose
about
the
premises
i
have
brought
brenda
with
me
as
a
beginning
and
i
think
i
know
where
to
lay
my
hand
on
a
good
old
collie
who
will
stay
near
any
house
i
am
in
and
let
no
one
trespass
about
it
with
impunity
good
heavens
munro
you
do
mean
to
say
you
think
the
man
would
me
i
exclaimed
i
do
know
what
he
might
or
might
not
do
he
replied
there
is
something
about
this
house
he
is
afraid
may
be
found
out
and
he
is
afraid
you
will
find
it
out
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
a
great
deal
depends
upon
the
secret
being
preserved
intact
at
present
we
can
only
surmise
its
nature
but
i
mean
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
to
know
more
of
harringford
antecedents
than
he
might
be
willing
to
communicate
to
anyone
what
is
the
matter
with
you
hal
you
look
as
white
as
a
corpse
i
was
only
thinking
i
answered
of
one
evening
last
week
when
i
fell
asleep
in
the
and
woke
in
a
fright
imagining
i
saw
that
horrid
light
streaming
out
from
the
library
and
a
face
pressed
up
close
to
the
glass
of
the
window
on
my
left
hand
peering
into
the
room
i
have
no
doubt
the
face
was
there
he
said
gravely
but
i
do
not
think
it
will
come
again
so
long
as
brenda
is
alive
nevertheless
i
should
be
careful
desperate
men
are
capable
of
desperate
deeds
the
first
post
next
morning
brought
me
a
letter
from
craven
which
proved
harringford
entertained
for
the
present
no
intention
of
proceeding
to
extremities
with
me
he
had
been
in
buckingham
street
so
said
my
principal
and
offered
to
buy
the
freehold
of
river
hall
for
twelve
hundred
pounds
craven
thought
he
might
be
induced
to
increase
his
bid
to
fifteen
hundred
and
added
miss
blake
has
half
consented
to
the
arrangement
and
miss
elmsdale
is
eager
for
the
matter
to
be
pushed
on
so
that
the
transfer
may
take
place
directly
she
comes
of
age
i
confess
now
an
actual
offer
has
been
made
i
feel
reluctant
to
sacrifice
the
property
for
such
a
sum
and
doubt
whether
it
might
not
be
better
to
offer
it
for
sale
by
auction
that
is
if
you
think
there
is
no
chance
of
your
discovering
the
reason
why
river
hall
bears
so
bad
a
name
have
you
obtained
any
clue
to
the
mystery
to
this
i
replied
in
a
note
which
munro
himself
conveyed
to
the
office
i
have
obtained
an
important
clue
but
that
is
all
i
can
say
for
the
present
will
you
tell
harringford
i
am
at
river
hall
and
that
you
think
being
on
the
spot
and
knowing
all
about
the
place
i
could
negotiate
the
matter
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
office
if
he
is
desirous
of
purchasing
he
will
not
object
to
calling
some
evening
and
discussing
the
matter
with
me
i
have
an
idea
that
a
large
sum
of
money
might
be
made
out
of
this
property
by
an
enterprising
man
like
harringford
and
it
is
just
possible
after
hearing
what
i
have
to
say
he
may
find
himself
able
to
make
a
much
better
offer
for
the
uninhabited
house
than
that
mentioned
in
your
note
at
all
events
the
interview
can
do
no
harm
i
am
still
suffering
so
much
from
cold
that
it
would
be
imprudent
for
me
to
wait
upon
harringford
which
would
otherwise
be
only
courteous
on
my
part
capital
said
munro
reading
over
my
shoulder
that
will
bring
my
gentleman
to
river
hall
but
what
is
wrong
patterson
you
are
surely
not
going
to
turn
chickenhearted
now
no
i
answered
but
i
wish
it
was
over
i
dread
something
and
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
though
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
waver
i
am
afraid
munro
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
it
i
am
afraid
as
i
was
the
first
night
i
stayed
in
this
house
i
am
not
a
coward
but
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
over
the
thames
then
he
came
back
and
wringing
my
hand
said
in
tones
that
tried
unsuccessfully
to
be
cheerful
i
know
what
it
is
old
fellow
do
you
think
i
have
not
had
the
feeling
myself
since
i
came
here
but
remember
it
has
to
be
done
and
i
will
stand
by
you
i
will
see
you
through
it
it
wo
do
for
you
to
be
in
the
room
though
i
suggested
no
but
i
will
stay
within
earshot
he
answered
we
did
not
talk
much
more
about
the
matter
men
rarely
do
talk
much
about
anything
which
seems
to
them
very
serious
and
i
may
candidly
say
that
i
had
never
felt
anything
in
my
life
to
be
much
more
serious
than
that
impending
interview
with
harringford
that
he
would
come
we
never
doubted
for
a
moment
and
we
were
right
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
appoint
an
interview
harringford
did
so
nine
on
thursday
evening
was
the
hour
he
named
apologizing
at
the
same
time
for
being
unable
to
call
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
day
humph
said
munro
turning
the
note
over
you
will
receive
him
in
the
library
of
course
hal
i
replied
such
was
my
intention
and
that
will
be
a
move
for
which
he
is
in
no
way
prepared
commented
my
friend
from
the
night
when
munro
walked
and
talked
with
harringford
no
person
came
spying
round
and
about
the
uninhabited
house
of
this
fact
we
were
satisfied
for
brenda
who
gave
tongue
at
the
slightest
murmur
wafted
over
the
river
from
the
barges
lying
waiting
for
the
tide
never
barked
as
though
she
were
on
the
track
of
living
being
whilst
the
collie
a
unkempt
but
yet
most
true
and
faithful
brute
which
munro
insisted
on
keeping
within
doors
never
raised
his
voice
from
the
day
he
arrived
at
river
hall
till
the
night
harringford
rang
the
when
the
animal
who
had
been
sleeping
with
his
nose
resting
on
his
paws
lifted
his
head
and
indulged
in
a
prolonged
howl
not
a
nice
beginning
to
an
interview
which
i
dreaded
a
terrible
interview
i
was
in
the
library
waiting
to
receive
harringford
a
bright
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
the
table
was
strewn
with
papers
munro
had
brought
to
me
from
the
office
the
gas
was
all
ablaze
and
the
room
looked
bright
and
cheerful
as
bright
and
as
cheerful
as
if
no
ghost
had
been
ever
heard
of
in
connection
with
it
at
a
few
minutes
past
nine
my
visitor
arrived
stott
ushered
him
into
the
library
and
he
entered
the
room
evidently
intending
to
shake
hands
with
me
which
civility
i
affected
not
to
notice
after
the
first
words
of
greeting
were
exchanged
i
asked
if
he
would
have
tea
or
coffee
or
wine
and
finding
he
rejected
all
offers
of
refreshment
i
rang
the
bell
and
told
stott
i
could
dispense
with
her
attendance
for
the
night
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
stay
in
this
house
entirely
alone
asked
my
visitor
until
stott
came
i
was
quite
alone
i
answered
i
would
not
have
done
it
for
any
consideration
he
remarked
possibly
not
i
replied
people
are
differently
constituted
it
was
not
long
before
we
got
to
business
his
offer
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
i
as
ridiculous
well
he
said
by
this
time
i
knew
i
had
a
keen
man
of
business
to
deal
with
put
the
place
up
to
auction
and
see
whether
you
will
get
as
much
there
are
two
or
rather
three
ways
of
dealing
with
the
property
which
have
occurred
to
me
harringford
i
explained
one
is
letting
or
selling
this
house
for
a
reformatory
or
school
ghosts
in
that
case
wo
trouble
the
inmates
we
may
be
quite
certain
another
is
utilizing
the
buildings
for
a
manufactory
and
the
third
is
laying
the
ground
out
for
building
purposes
thus
as
i
spoke
i
laid
before
him
a
plan
for
a
square
of
building
the
south
side
being
formed
by
the
river
i
had
taken
great
pains
with
the
drawing
of
this
plan
the
future
houses
the
future
square
the
future
with
seats
at
intervals
were
all
to
be
found
in
the
roll
which
i
unfolded
and
laid
before
him
and
the
effect
my
sketch
produced
surprised
me
in
heaven
name
patterson
he
asked
where
did
you
get
this
you
never
drew
it
out
of
your
own
head
i
hastened
to
assure
him
i
had
certainly
not
got
it
out
of
any
other
person
head
but
he
smiled
incredulously
probably
he
suggested
elmsdale
left
some
such
sketch
behind
him
something
at
all
events
which
suggested
the
idea
to
you
if
he
did
i
never
saw
nor
heard
of
it
i
answered
you
may
have
forgotten
the
circumstance
he
persisted
but
i
feel
confident
you
must
have
seen
something
like
this
before
perhaps
amongst
the
papers
in
craven
office
may
i
inquire
why
you
have
formed
such
an
opinion
i
said
a
little
stiffly
simply
because
this
square
was
a
favourite
project
of
the
late
owner
of
river
hall
he
replied
after
the
death
of
his
wife
the
place
grew
distasteful
to
him
and
i
have
often
heard
him
say
he
would
convert
the
ground
into
one
of
the
handsomest
squares
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
all
he
wanted
was
a
piece
of
additional
land
lying
to
the
west
which
piece
is
i
believe
now
to
be
had
at
a
price
i
sat
like
one
stricken
dumb
by
no
mental
process
for
which
i
could
ever
account
had
that
idea
been
evolved
it
sprang
into
life
at
a
bound
it
came
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
i
wakened
at
once
with
the
whole
plan
clear
and
distinct
before
my
mind
eye
as
it
now
lay
clear
and
distinct
before
harringford
it
is
very
extraordinary
i
managed
at
last
to
stammer
out
for
i
can
honestly
say
i
never
heard
even
a
suggestion
of
elmsdale
design
indeed
i
did
not
know
he
had
ever
thought
of
building
upon
the
ground
such
was
the
fact
however
replied
my
visitor
he
was
a
speculative
man
in
many
ways
yes
very
speculative
and
full
of
plans
and
projects
however
patterson
he
proceeded
all
this
only
proves
the
truth
of
the
old
remark
that
wits
and
little
wits
sometimes
jump
together
there
was
a
ring
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
as
in
his
words
but
i
did
not
give
much
heed
to
it
the
design
then
was
not
mine
it
had
come
to
me
in
sleep
it
had
been
forced
upon
me
it
had
been
explained
to
me
in
a
word
and
as
i
asked
myself
by
whom
i
was
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
you
are
not
well
i
fear
said
harringford
this
place
seems
to
have
affected
your
health
surely
you
have
acted
imprudently
in
risking
so
much
to
gain
so
little
i
do
not
agree
with
you
i
replied
however
time
will
show
whether
i
have
been
right
or
wrong
in
coming
here
i
have
learned
many
things
of
which
i
was
previously
in
ignorance
and
i
think
i
hold
a
clue
in
my
hands
which
properly
followed
may
lead
me
to
the
hidden
mystery
of
river
hall
indeed
he
exclaimed
may
i
ask
the
nature
of
that
clue
it
would
be
premature
for
me
to
say
more
than
this
that
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
whether
elmsdale
committed
suicide
do
you
think
his
death
was
the
result
of
accident
then
he
inquired
his
face
blanching
to
a
ghastly
whiteness
no
i
do
not
i
answered
bluntly
but
my
thoughts
can
have
little
interest
for
anyone
at
present
what
we
want
to
talk
about
is
the
sale
and
purchase
of
this
place
the
offer
you
made
to
craven
i
consider
ridiculous
let
on
building
lease
the
land
alone
would
bring
in
a
handsome
income
and
the
house
ought
to
sell
for
about
as
much
as
you
offer
for
the
whole
property
perhaps
it
might
if
you
could
find
a
purchaser
he
answered
and
the
land
might
return
an
income
if
you
could
let
it
as
you
suggest
but
in
the
meantime
while
the
grass
grows
the
steed
starves
and
while
you
are
waiting
for
your
buyer
and
your
speculative
builder
miss
blake
and
miss
elmsdale
will
have
to
walk
barefoot
waiting
for
shoes
you
may
never
be
able
to
provide
for
them
there
was
truth
in
this
but
only
a
i
felt
so
i
said
when
examined
at
the
inquest
harringford
you
stated
i
think
that
you
were
under
considerable
obligations
to
mr
elmsdale
did
i
he
remarked
possibly
he
had
given
me
a
once
or
twice
and
probably
i
mentioned
the
fact
it
is
a
long
time
ago
though
not
so
very
long
i
answered
not
long
enough
i
should
imagine
to
enable
you
to
forget
any
benefits
you
may
have
received
from
mr
elmsdale
patterson
he
interrupted
are
we
talking
business
or
sentiment
if
the
former
please
understand
i
have
my
own
interests
to
attend
to
and
that
i
mean
to
attend
to
them
if
the
latter
i
am
willing
if
you
say
miss
elmsdale
has
pressing
need
for
the
money
to
send
her
my
cheque
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
pounds
charity
is
one
thing
trade
another
and
i
do
not
care
to
mix
them
i
should
never
have
attained
to
my
present
position
had
i
allowed
fine
feelings
to
interfere
with
the
driving
of
a
bargain
i
do
want
river
hall
i
would
not
give
that
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
to
have
the
in
my
hands
but
as
miss
elmsdale
wishes
to
sell
and
as
no
one
else
will
buy
i
offer
what
i
consider
a
fair
price
for
the
place
if
you
think
you
can
do
better
well
and
good
if
he
stopped
suddenly
in
his
sentence
then
rising
he
cried
it
is
a
trick
a
vile
infamous
disgraceful
trick
while
his
utterance
grew
thick
and
his
face
began
to
work
like
that
of
a
person
in
convulsions
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
rising
also
and
turning
to
look
in
the
direction
he
indicated
with
outstretched
arm
and
dilated
eyes
then
i
saw
no
need
for
him
to
answer
standing
in
the
entrance
to
the
strong
room
was
robert
elmsdale
himself
darkness
for
a
background
the
light
of
the
gas
falling
full
upon
his
face
slowly
sternly
he
came
forward
step
by
step
with
footfalls
that
fell
noiselessly
he
advanced
across
the
carpet
moving
steadily
forward
towards
harringford
who
beating
the
air
with
his
hands
screamed
keep
him
off
do
let
him
touch
me
and
fell
full
length
on
the
floor
next
instant
munro
was
in
the
room
hullo
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
what
have
you
done
to
him
what
has
he
been
doing
to
you
i
could
not
answer
looking
in
my
face
i
think
munro
understood
we
had
both
seen
that
which
no
man
can
behold
unappalled
come
hal
he
said
bestir
yourself
whatever
has
happened
sink
under
it
like
a
woman
help
me
to
lift
him
merciful
heaven
he
added
as
he
raised
the
prostrate
figure
he
is
dead
to
this
hour
i
do
not
know
how
we
managed
to
carry
him
into
the
i
can
not
imagine
how
our
trembling
hands
bore
that
inert
body
out
of
the
library
and
across
the
hall
it
seems
like
a
dream
to
me
calling
up
stott
and
then
tearing
away
from
the
house
in
quest
of
further
medical
help
haunted
every
step
i
took
by
the
memory
of
that
awful
presence
the
mere
sight
of
which
had
stricken
down
one
of
us
in
the
midst
of
his
buying
and
bargaining
and
boasting
i
had
done
it
i
had
raised
that
ghost
i
had
brought
the
man
to
his
death
and
as
i
fled
through
the
night
innocent
as
i
had
been
of
the
thought
of
such
a
catastrophe
i
understood
what
cain
must
have
felt
when
he
went
out
to
live
his
life
with
the
brand
of
murderer
upon
him
but
the
man
was
not
dead
though
he
lay
for
hours
like
one
from
whom
life
had
departed
he
did
not
die
then
we
had
all
the
genius
and
knowledge
and
skill
of
london
at
his
service
if
doctors
could
have
saved
him
he
had
lived
if
nursing
could
have
availed
him
he
had
recovered
for
i
never
left
him
when
the
end
came
i
was
almost
worn
out
myself
and
the
end
came
very
soon
no
more
doctors
whispered
the
sick
man
they
can
not
cure
me
send
for
a
clergyman
and
a
lawyer
craven
as
well
as
any
other
it
is
all
over
now
and
better
so
life
is
but
a
long
fever
perhaps
he
will
sleep
now
and
let
me
sleep
too
yes
i
killed
him
why
i
will
tell
you
give
me
some
wine
what
i
said
at
the
inquest
about
owing
my
worldly
prosperity
to
him
was
true
i
trace
my
pecuniary
success
to
elmsdale
but
i
trace
also
hours
months
and
years
of
anguish
to
his
agency
my
god
the
nights
that
man
has
made
me
spend
when
he
was
living
the
nights
i
have
spent
in
consequence
of
his
death
he
stopped
he
had
mentally
gone
back
over
a
long
journey
he
was
retracing
the
road
he
had
travelled
from
youth
to
old
age
for
he
was
old
if
not
in
years
in
sorrow
lying
on
his
he
understood
for
what
a
game
he
had
burnt
his
candle
to
the
socket
comprehended
how
the
agony
and
the
suspense
and
the
suffering
and
the
long
long
fever
of
life
which
with
him
never
knew
a
remittent
moment
had
robbed
him
of
that
which
every
man
has
a
right
to
expect
some
pleasure
in
the
course
of
his
existence
when
i
first
met
elmsdale
he
went
on
i
was
a
young
man
and
an
ambitious
one
i
was
a
clerk
in
the
city
i
had
been
married
a
couple
of
years
to
a
wife
i
loved
dearly
she
was
possessed
of
only
a
small
dot
and
after
furnishing
our
house
and
paying
for
all
the
expenses
incident
on
the
coming
of
a
first
child
we
thought
ourselves
fortunate
in
knowing
there
was
still
a
deposit
standing
in
our
name
at
the
bank
for
something
over
two
hundred
pounds
nevertheless
i
was
anxious
so
far
we
had
lived
within
our
income
but
with
an
annual
advance
of
salary
only
amounting
to
ten
pounds
or
thereabouts
i
did
not
see
how
we
were
to
manage
when
more
children
came
particularly
as
the
cost
of
living
increased
day
by
day
it
was
a
dear
year
that
of
which
i
am
speaking
i
do
not
precisely
remember
on
what
occasion
it
was
i
first
saw
elmsdale
but
i
knew
afterwards
he
picked
me
out
as
a
person
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
he
was
on
good
terms
with
my
employers
and
asked
them
to
allow
me
to
bid
for
some
houses
he
wanted
to
purchase
at
a
sale
to
this
hour
i
do
not
know
why
he
did
not
bid
for
them
himself
he
gave
me
a
note
for
my
services
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
our
connection
off
and
on
i
did
many
things
for
him
of
one
sort
or
another
and
made
rather
a
nice
addition
to
my
salary
out
of
doing
them
till
the
devil
or
he
or
both
put
it
into
my
head
to
start
as
builder
and
speculator
on
my
own
account
i
had
two
hundred
pounds
and
my
furniture
that
was
the
whole
of
my
capital
but
elmsdale
found
me
money
i
thought
my
fortune
was
made
the
day
he
advanced
me
my
first
five
hundred
pounds
if
i
had
known
if
i
had
known
do
talk
any
more
i
entreated
what
can
it
avail
to
speak
of
such
matters
now
he
turned
towards
me
impatiently
not
talk
he
repeated
when
i
have
for
years
been
as
one
dumb
and
at
length
the
string
of
my
tongue
is
loosened
not
talk
when
if
i
keep
silence
now
he
will
haunt
me
in
eternity
as
he
has
haunted
me
in
time
i
did
not
answer
i
only
moistened
his
parched
lips
and
bathed
his
burning
forehead
as
tenderly
as
my
unaccustomed
hands
understood
how
to
perform
such
offices
lift
me
up
a
little
please
he
said
and
i
put
the
pillows
in
position
as
deftly
as
i
could
you
are
not
a
bad
fellow
he
remarked
but
i
am
not
going
to
leave
you
anything
god
forbid
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
are
not
you
in
want
of
money
he
asked
not
of
yours
i
answered
mine
he
said
it
is
not
mine
it
is
his
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
money
and
he
has
come
back
for
it
he
ca
rest
and
he
wo
let
me
rest
till
i
have
paid
him
principal
and
interest
compound
interest
yes
well
i
am
able
to
do
even
that
we
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
spoke
again
when
i
first
went
into
business
with
my
borrowed
capital
nothing
i
touched
really
succeeded
i
found
myself
going
back
back
far
better
was
my
position
as
clerk
then
at
least
i
slept
sound
at
nights
and
relished
my
meals
but
i
had
tasted
of
independence
and
i
could
not
go
back
to
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
an
employer
ah
no
employer
ever
made
me
work
so
hard
as
elmsdale
no
beck
and
call
were
ever
so
imperative
as
his
i
pass
over
a
long
time
of
anxiety
struggle
and
hardship
the
world
thought
me
a
prosperous
man
probably
no
human
being
save
elmsdale
understood
my
real
position
and
he
made
my
position
almost
unendurable
how
i
came
first
to
bet
on
races
would
be
a
long
story
longer
than
i
have
time
to
tell
but
my
betting
began
upon
a
very
small
scale
and
i
always
won
always
in
the
beginning
i
won
so
certainly
and
so
continuously
that
finally
i
began
to
hope
for
deliverance
from
elmsdale
clutches
i
do
know
how
the
narrative
was
not
recited
straight
on
as
i
am
writing
it
but
by
starts
as
strength
served
him
elmsdale
ascertained
i
was
devoting
myself
to
the
turf
all
i
can
say
is
he
did
ascertain
the
fact
and
followed
me
down
to
ascot
to
make
sure
there
was
no
mistake
in
his
information
at
the
previous
derby
my
luck
had
begun
to
turn
i
had
lost
then
lost
heavily
for
me
and
he
taxed
me
with
having
done
so
in
equity
and
at
law
he
had
then
the
power
of
foreclosing
on
every
house
and
rood
of
ground
i
owned
i
was
in
his
power
in
the
power
of
robert
elmsdale
think
of
it
but
you
never
knew
him
young
man
you
ought
to
kneel
down
and
thank
god
you
were
never
so
placed
as
to
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
devil
if
ever
you
should
get
into
the
power
of
a
man
like
robert
elmsdale
do
offend
him
it
is
bad
enough
to
owe
him
money
but
it
is
worse
for
him
to
owe
you
a
grudge
i
had
offended
him
he
was
always
worrying
me
about
his
wife
lamenting
her
extolling
her
beauty
glorifying
himself
on
having
married
a
woman
of
birth
and
breeding
just
as
if
his
were
the
only
wife
in
the
world
as
if
other
men
had
not
at
home
women
twice
as
good
if
not
as
handsome
as
miss
blake
sister
under
miss
blake
insolence
i
had
writhed
and
once
when
my
usual
prudence
deserted
me
i
told
elmsdale
i
had
been
in
ireland
and
seen
the
paternal
blake
ancestral
cabin
and
ascertained
none
of
the
family
had
ever
mixed
amongst
the
upper
thousand
or
whatever
the
number
may
be
which
goes
to
make
up
society
in
the
isle
of
saints
it
was
foolish
and
it
was
wrong
but
i
could
not
help
saying
what
i
did
and
from
that
hour
he
was
my
enemy
hitherto
he
had
merely
been
my
creditor
my
own
imprudent
speech
transformed
him
into
a
man
lying
in
wait
to
ruin
me
he
bided
his
time
he
was
a
man
who
could
wait
for
years
before
he
struck
but
who
would
never
strike
till
he
could
make
sure
of
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
he
drew
me
into
his
power
more
and
more
and
then
he
told
me
he
did
not
intend
to
continue
trusting
anyone
who
betted
that
he
must
have
his
money
if
he
had
not
it
by
a
certain
date
which
he
named
he
would
foreclose
that
meant
he
would
beggar
me
and
i
with
an
ailing
wife
and
a
large
family
i
appealed
to
him
i
do
remember
now
what
i
said
but
i
do
recollect
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
stone
what
i
endured
during
the
time
which
followed
i
could
not
describe
were
i
to
talk
for
ever
till
a
man
in
extremity
tries
to
raise
money
he
never
understands
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
i
had
been
short
of
money
every
hour
since
i
first
engaged
in
business
and
yet
i
never
comprehended
the
meaning
of
a
till
then
one
day
in
the
city
when
i
was
almost
mad
with
anxiety
i
met
elmsdale
you
be
ready
for
me
harringford
he
asked
do
not
know
i
hope
so
i
answered
remember
if
you
are
not
prepared
with
the
money
i
shall
be
prepared
to
act
he
said
with
an
evil
smile
as
i
walked
home
that
evening
an
idea
flashed
into
my
mind
i
had
tried
all
honest
means
of
raising
the
money
i
would
try
dishonest
my
credit
was
good
i
had
large
transactions
with
houses
i
was
in
the
habit
of
discounting
largely
and
i
well
i
signed
names
to
paper
that
i
ought
not
to
have
done
i
had
the
bills
put
through
i
had
four
months
and
three
days
in
which
to
turn
round
and
i
might
by
that
time
be
able
to
raise
sufficient
to
retire
the
acceptances
in
the
meantime
i
could
face
elmsdale
and
so
i
wrote
appointing
an
evening
when
i
would
call
with
the
money
and
take
his
release
for
all
claims
upon
me
when
i
arrived
at
river
hall
he
had
all
the
necessary
documents
ready
but
refused
to
give
them
up
in
exchange
for
my
cheque
he
could
not
trust
me
he
said
and
he
had
moreover
no
banking
account
if
i
liked
to
bring
the
amount
in
notes
well
and
good
if
not
he
would
instruct
his
solicitors
the
next
day
i
had
important
business
to
attend
to
so
a
stormy
interview
ended
in
my
writing
cash
on
the
cheque
and
his
consenting
to
take
it
to
my
bankers
himself
my
business
on
the
following
day
which
happened
to
be
out
of
town
detained
me
much
longer
than
i
anticipated
and
it
was
late
before
i
could
reach
river
hall
late
though
it
was
however
i
determined
to
go
after
my
papers
i
held
elmsdale
receipt
for
the
cheque
certainly
but
i
knew
i
had
not
an
hour
to
lose
in
putting
matters
in
train
for
another
loan
if
i
was
to
retire
the
forged
acceptances
by
experience
i
knew
how
the
months
slipped
away
when
money
had
to
be
provided
at
the
end
of
them
and
i
was
feverishly
anxious
to
hold
my
leases
and
once
more
i
arrived
at
the
door
leading
to
the
library
elmsdale
opened
it
as
wide
as
the
chain
would
permit
and
asked
who
was
there
i
told
him
and
grumbling
a
little
at
the
unconscionable
hour
at
which
i
had
elected
to
pay
my
visit
he
admitted
me
he
was
out
of
temper
he
had
hoped
and
expected
i
knew
to
find
payment
of
the
cheque
refused
and
he
could
not
submit
with
equanimity
to
seeing
me
slip
out
of
his
hands
evidently
he
did
not
expect
me
to
come
that
night
for
his
table
was
strewed
with
deeds
and
notes
which
he
had
been
reckoning
up
no
doubt
as
a
miser
counts
his
gold
a
pair
of
pistols
lay
beside
his
desk
close
to
my
hand
as
i
took
the
seat
he
indicated
we
talked
long
and
bitterly
it
does
not
matter
now
what
he
said
or
i
said
we
fenced
round
and
about
a
quarrel
during
the
whole
interview
i
was
meek
because
i
wanted
him
to
let
me
have
part
of
the
money
at
all
events
on
loan
again
and
he
was
blatant
and
insolent
because
he
fancied
i
cringed
to
him
and
i
did
cringe
i
prayed
for
help
that
night
from
man
as
i
have
never
since
prayed
for
help
from
god
you
are
still
young
patterson
and
life
as
yet
is
new
to
you
or
else
i
would
ask
whether
in
going
into
an
entirely
strange
office
you
have
not
if
agitated
in
mind
picked
up
from
the
table
a
letter
or
card
and
kept
twisting
it
about
utterly
unconscious
for
the
time
being
of
the
social
solecism
you
were
committing
in
precisely
the
same
spirit
god
is
my
witness
as
i
am
a
dying
man
with
no
object
to
serve
in
speaking
falsehoods
while
we
talked
i
took
up
one
of
the
pistols
and
commenced
handling
it
care
he
said
is
loaded
hearing
which
i
laid
it
down
again
for
a
time
we
went
on
talking
he
trying
to
ascertain
how
i
had
obtained
the
money
i
striving
to
mislead
him
elmsdale
i
remarked
at
last
see
i
have
been
able
to
raise
the
money
now
be
friendly
and
consent
to
advance
me
a
few
thousands
at
a
fair
rate
on
a
property
i
am
negotiating
for
there
is
no
occasion
surely
for
us
to
quarrel
after
all
the
years
we
have
done
business
together
say
you
will
give
me
a
once
more
and
then
he
interrupted
me
and
swore
with
a
great
oath
he
would
never
have
another
transaction
with
me
you
have
paid
he
said
know
you
are
hopelessly
insolvent
i
can
not
tell
where
or
how
you
have
managed
to
raise
that
money
but
certain
am
i
it
has
been
by
deceiving
some
one
and
so
sure
as
i
stand
here
i
will
know
all
about
the
transaction
within
a
month
while
we
talked
he
had
been
at
intervals
passing
to
and
from
his
strong
room
putting
away
the
notes
and
papers
previously
lying
about
on
the
table
and
as
he
made
this
last
observation
he
was
standing
just
within
the
door
placing
something
on
the
shelf
is
of
no
use
talking
to
me
any
more
he
went
on
you
talked
from
now
to
eternity
you
could
not
alter
my
decision
there
are
your
deeds
take
them
and
never
let
me
see
you
in
my
house
again
he
came
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
at
that
moment
looking
burly
and
insolent
and
braggart
as
was
his
wont
something
in
his
face
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
in
the
vulgar
assumption
of
his
manner
maddened
me
i
do
not
know
i
have
never
been
able
to
tell
what
made
me
long
at
that
moment
to
kill
him
but
i
did
long
with
an
impulse
i
could
not
resist
i
rose
as
he
returned
towards
the
table
and
snatching
a
pistol
from
the
table
fired
before
he
could
realize
my
intention
the
bullet
was
in
his
brain
he
was
dead
and
i
a
murderer
you
can
understand
pretty
well
what
followed
i
ran
into
the
passage
and
opened
the
door
then
finding
no
one
seemed
to
have
heard
the
report
of
the
pistol
my
senses
came
back
to
me
i
was
not
sorry
for
what
i
had
done
all
i
cared
for
was
to
avert
suspicion
from
myself
and
to
secure
some
advantage
from
his
death
stealing
back
into
the
room
i
took
all
the
money
i
could
find
as
well
as
deeds
and
other
securities
these
last
i
destroyed
next
day
and
in
doing
so
i
felt
a
savage
satisfaction
he
would
have
served
them
the
same
as
me
i
thought
all
the
rest
you
know
pretty
well
from
the
hour
i
left
him
lying
dead
in
the
library
every
worldly
plan
prospered
with
me
if
i
invested
in
land
it
trebled
in
value
did
i
speculate
in
houses
they
were
sought
after
as
investments
i
grew
rich
respected
a
man
of
standing
i
had
sold
my
soul
to
the
devil
and
he
paid
me
even
higher
wages
than
those
for
which
i
engaged
but
there
was
a
balance
one
after
another
wife
and
children
died
and
while
my
heart
was
breaking
by
reason
of
my
home
left
desolate
there
came
to
me
the
first
rumour
of
this
place
being
haunted
i
would
not
believe
it
i
did
not
i
fought
against
the
truth
as
men
fight
with
despair
i
used
to
come
here
at
night
and
wander
as
near
to
the
house
as
i
safely
could
the
place
dogged
me
sleeping
and
waking
that
library
was
an
memory
i
have
sat
in
my
lonely
rooms
till
i
could
endure
the
horrors
of
imagination
no
longer
and
been
forced
to
come
from
london
that
i
might
look
at
this
terrible
house
with
the
silent
river
flowing
sullenly
past
its
desolate
gardens
life
seemed
ebbing
away
from
me
i
saw
that
day
by
day
the
blood
left
my
cheeks
i
looked
at
my
hands
and
beheld
they
were
becoming
like
those
of
some
one
very
aged
my
lameness
grew
perceptible
to
others
as
well
as
to
me
and
i
could
distinguish
as
i
walked
in
the
sunshine
the
shadow
my
figure
threw
was
that
of
one
deformed
i
grew
weak
and
worn
and
tired
yet
i
never
thoroughly
lost
heart
till
i
knew
you
had
come
here
to
unravel
the
secret
it
will
be
revealed
to
him
i
thought
i
do
not
kill
him
too
you
have
been
within
an
ace
of
death
often
and
often
since
you
set
yourself
this
task
but
at
the
last
instant
my
heart
always
failed
me
well
you
are
to
live
and
i
to
die
it
was
to
be
so
i
suppose
but
you
will
never
be
nearer
your
last
moment
till
you
lie
a
corpse
than
you
have
been
twice
at
any
rate
then
i
understood
how
accurately
munro
had
judged
when
he
warned
me
to
be
on
my
guard
against
this
man
now
harmless
and
dying
but
so
recently
desperate
and
for
evil
and
as
i
recalled
the
nights
i
had
spent
in
that
desolate
house
i
shivered
even
now
though
the
years
have
come
and
the
years
have
gone
since
i
kept
my
lonely
watch
in
river
hall
i
start
sometimes
from
sleep
with
a
great
horror
of
darkness
upon
me
and
a
feeling
that
stealthily
some
one
is
creeping
through
the
silence
to
take
my
life
conclusion
i
can
remember
the
day
and
the
hour
as
if
it
had
all
happened
yesterday
i
can
recall
the
view
from
the
windows
distinctly
as
though
time
had
stood
still
ever
since
there
are
no
gardens
under
our
windows
in
buckingham
street
buckingham
gate
stands
the
entrance
to
a
desert
of
mud
on
which
the
young
arabs
shoeless
stockingless
are
disporting
themselves
it
is
low
water
and
the
river
steamers
keep
towards
the
middle
arches
of
waterloo
up
aloft
the
hungerford
suspension
rears
itself
in
mid
air
and
that
new
bridge
across
which
trains
run
now
ceaselessly
has
not
yet
been
projected
it
is
a
bright
spring
day
the
sunshine
falls
upon
the
buildings
on
the
surrey
side
and
lights
them
with
a
picturesque
beauty
to
which
they
have
not
the
slightest
title
a
barge
laden
with
hay
is
lying
almost
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
thames
there
is
even
in
london
a
great
promise
and
hope
about
that
pleasant
spring
day
but
for
me
life
has
held
no
promise
and
the
future
no
hope
since
that
night
when
the
mystery
of
river
hall
was
solved
in
my
presence
and
out
of
his
own
mouth
the
murderer
uttered
his
condemnation
how
the
weeks
and
the
months
had
passed
with
me
is
soon
told
ill
when
i
left
river
hall
shortly
after
my
return
home
i
fell
sick
unto
death
and
lay
like
one
who
had
already
entered
the
valley
of
the
shadow
i
was
too
weak
to
move
i
was
too
faint
to
think
and
when
at
length
i
was
brought
slowly
back
to
the
recollection
of
life
and
its
cares
of
all
i
had
experienced
and
suffered
in
the
uninhabited
house
the
time
spent
in
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
memory
of
some
frightful
dream
i
had
lost
my
health
there
and
my
love
too
helena
was
now
further
removed
from
me
than
ever
she
was
a
great
heiress
harringford
had
left
her
all
his
money
absolutely
and
already
miss
blake
was
considering
which
of
the
suitors
who
now
came
rushing
to
woo
it
would
be
best
for
her
niece
to
as
for
me
taylor
repeated
by
way
of
a
good
joke
that
her
aunt
referred
to
me
as
a
decent
sort
of
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
but
weakly
and
ignoring
the
fact
of
ever
having
stated
she
would
not
mind
giving
fifty
pounds
remarked
to
craven
that
if
i
was
in
poor
circumstances
he
might
pay
me
five
or
ten
sovereigns
and
charge
the
amount
to
her
account
of
all
this
craven
said
nothing
to
me
he
only
came
perpetually
to
my
and
told
my
mother
that
whenever
i
was
able
to
leave
town
i
must
get
away
drawing
upon
him
for
whatever
sums
i
might
require
i
did
not
need
to
encroach
on
his
kindness
however
for
my
uncle
hearing
of
my
illness
sent
me
a
cordial
invitation
to
spend
some
time
with
him
in
his
cottage
far
away
from
london
strength
at
last
returned
to
me
and
by
the
autumn
my
old
place
in
craven
office
was
no
longer
vacant
i
sat
in
my
accustomed
corner
pursuing
former
avocations
a
changed
man
i
was
as
ever
but
hope
lightened
my
road
no
longer
to
a
penny
i
knew
the
amount
of
my
lady
fortune
and
understood
harringford
bequest
had
set
her
as
far
above
me
as
the
stars
are
above
the
earth
i
had
the
conduct
of
most
of
miss
elmsdale
business
as
a
compliment
perhaps
craven
entrusted
all
the
work
connected
with
harringford
estate
to
me
and
i
accepted
that
trust
as
i
should
have
done
any
other
which
he
might
choose
to
place
in
my
hands
but
i
could
have
dispensed
with
his
kindness
every
visit
i
paid
to
miss
blake
filled
my
soul
with
bitterness
had
i
been
a
porter
a
or
a
potman
she
might
i
suppose
have
treated
me
with
some
sort
of
courtesy
but
as
matters
stood
her
every
tone
word
and
look
said
plainly
as
possible
if
you
do
not
know
your
station
i
will
teach
it
to
you
as
for
helena
she
was
always
the
same
sweet
and
kind
and
grateful
and
gracious
but
she
had
her
friends
about
her
new
lovers
waiting
for
her
smiles
and
after
a
time
the
shadow
cast
across
her
youth
would
i
understood
be
altogether
removed
and
leave
her
free
to
begin
a
new
and
beautiful
life
unalloyed
by
that
hideous
haunting
memory
of
suicide
which
had
changed
into
melancholy
the
gay
cheerfulness
of
her
lovely
girlhood
yes
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
streamlet
and
the
snow
of
the
rose
and
the
wind
to
others
my
love
might
not
have
seemed
hopeless
but
to
me
it
was
dead
as
the
flowers
i
had
seen
blooming
a
year
before
not
for
any
earthly
consideration
would
i
have
made
a
claim
upon
her
affection
what
i
had
done
had
been
done
freely
and
loyally
i
gave
it
all
to
her
as
utterly
as
i
had
previously
given
my
heart
and
now
i
could
make
no
bargain
with
my
dear
i
never
for
a
moment
thought
she
owed
me
anything
for
my
pains
and
trouble
her
kindly
glances
her
sweet
words
her
little
thoughtful
turns
of
manner
were
free
gifts
of
her
goodness
but
in
no
sense
payment
for
my
services
she
understood
i
could
not
presume
upon
them
and
was
perhaps
better
satisfied
it
should
be
so
but
nothing
satisfied
miss
blake
and
at
length
between
her
and
craven
there
ensued
a
serious
disagreement
she
insisted
he
should
not
send
that
clerk
of
his
to
the
house
again
and
suggested
if
craven
were
too
high
and
mighty
to
attend
to
the
concerns
of
miss
elmsdale
himself
miss
blake
must
look
out
for
another
solicitor
the
sooner
the
better
madam
said
craven
with
great
state
and
miss
blake
left
in
a
huff
and
actually
did
go
off
to
a
rival
attorney
who
however
firmly
declined
to
undertake
her
business
then
helena
came
as
peacemaker
she
smoothed
down
ruffled
feathers
and
talked
him
into
a
good
temper
and
effected
a
reconciliation
with
her
aunt
and
then
nearly
spoilt
everything
by
adding
but
indeed
i
think
patterson
had
better
not
come
to
see
us
for
the
present
at
all
events
you
ungrateful
girl
exclaimed
craven
but
she
answered
with
a
little
sob
that
she
was
not
ungrateful
only
only
she
thought
it
would
be
better
if
i
stayed
away
and
so
taylor
took
my
duties
on
him
and
as
a
natural
consequence
some
very
pretty
disputes
between
him
and
miss
blake
had
to
be
arranged
by
craven
thus
the
winter
passed
and
it
was
spring
again
that
spring
day
of
which
i
have
spoken
craven
and
i
were
alone
in
the
office
he
had
come
late
into
town
and
was
reading
his
letters
whilst
i
seated
by
a
window
overlooking
the
thames
gave
about
equal
attention
to
the
river
outside
and
a
tedious
document
lying
on
my
table
we
had
not
spoken
a
word
i
think
for
ten
minutes
when
a
slip
of
paper
was
brought
in
on
which
was
written
a
name
ask
her
to
walk
in
said
craven
and
going
to
the
door
he
greeted
the
visitor
and
led
miss
elmsdale
into
the
room
i
rose
irresolute
but
she
came
forward
and
with
a
charming
blush
held
out
her
hand
and
asked
me
some
commonplace
question
about
my
health
then
i
was
going
but
she
entreated
me
not
to
leave
the
room
on
her
account
this
is
my
birthday
craven
she
went
on
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
wish
me
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
to
do
something
for
me
will
you
i
wish
you
every
happiness
my
dear
he
answered
with
a
tenderness
born
perhaps
of
olden
memories
and
of
towards
one
so
sweet
and
beautiful
and
lonely
and
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
on
your
birthday
why
it
is
done
that
is
all
i
can
say
she
clasped
her
dear
hands
round
his
arm
and
led
him
towards
a
further
window
i
could
see
her
downcast
eyes
the
long
lashes
lying
on
her
cheeks
the
soft
colour
flitting
and
coming
making
her
alternately
pale
and
rosy
and
i
was
jealous
heaven
forgive
me
if
she
had
hung
so
trustfully
about
one
of
the
patriarchs
i
should
have
been
jealous
though
he
reckoned
his
years
by
centuries
what
she
had
to
say
was
said
quickly
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
bringing
her
lips
close
to
his
ear
and
lifting
her
eyes
imploringly
to
his
when
she
had
finished
upon
my
word
miss
he
exclaimed
aloud
and
he
held
her
from
him
and
looked
at
her
till
the
colour
rushed
in
beautiful
blushes
even
to
her
temples
and
her
lashes
were
wet
with
tears
and
her
cheeks
dimpled
with
smiles
upon
my
word
and
you
make
such
a
request
to
me
to
me
who
have
a
character
to
maintain
and
who
have
daughters
of
my
own
to
whom
i
am
bound
to
set
a
good
example
patterson
come
here
can
you
imagine
what
this
young
lady
wants
me
to
do
for
her
now
she
is
she
tells
me
and
she
wants
me
to
ask
you
to
marry
her
she
says
she
will
never
marry
anyone
else
then
as
i
hung
back
a
little
dazed
fearful
and
unable
to
credit
the
evidence
of
my
senses
he
added
take
her
she
means
it
every
word
and
you
deserve
to
have
her
if
she
had
chosen
anybody
else
i
would
never
have
drawn
out
her
settlements
but
i
would
not
take
her
not
then
standing
there
with
the
spring
landscape
blurred
for
the
moment
before
me
i
tried
to
tell
them
both
what
i
felt
at
first
my
words
were
low
and
broken
for
the
change
from
misery
to
happiness
affected
me
almost
as
though
i
had
been
suddenly
plunged
from
happiness
into
despair
but
by
degrees
i
recovered
my
senses
and
told
my
darling
and
craven
it
was
not
fit
she
should
out
of
very
generosity
give
herself
to
me
a
man
utterly
destitute
of
fortune
a
man
who
though
he
loved
her
better
than
life
was
only
a
clerk
at
a
clerk
salary
if
i
were
a
duke
i
went
on
breaking
ground
at
last
with
a
revenue
and
a
duke
rank
i
should
only
value
what
i
had
for
her
sake
i
would
carry
my
money
and
my
birth
and
my
position
to
her
and
ask
her
to
take
all
if
she
would
only
take
me
with
them
but
as
matters
stand
craven
i
owe
everything
worth
having
in
life
to
you
she
said
impetuously
taking
my
hand
in
hers
i
should
not
like
you
at
all
if
you
were
a
duke
and
had
a
ducal
revenue
i
think
you
are
too
patterson
agreed
craven
she
does
owe
everything
she
has
to
your
determination
remember
but
i
undertook
to
solve
the
mystery
for
fifty
pounds
i
remarked
smiling
in
spite
of
myself
which
has
never
been
paid
remarked
my
employer
but
he
went
on
you
young
people
come
here
and
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
the
affair
over
all
together
and
so
he
put
us
in
chairs
as
if
we
had
been
clients
while
he
took
his
professional
seat
and
after
a
pause
began
my
dear
helena
i
think
the
young
man
has
reason
a
woman
should
marry
her
equal
he
will
in
a
worldly
sense
be
more
than
your
equal
some
day
but
that
is
nothing
a
man
should
be
head
of
the
household
it
is
good
and
nice
and
loving
of
you
my
child
to
wish
to
endow
your
husband
with
all
your
worldly
goods
but
your
husband
ought
before
he
takes
you
to
have
goods
of
his
own
wherewith
to
endow
you
now
now
now
do
purse
up
your
pretty
mouth
and
try
to
controvert
a
wisdom
you
are
both
young
you
have
plenty
of
time
before
you
he
ought
to
be
given
an
opportunity
of
showing
what
he
can
do
and
you
ought
to
mix
in
society
and
see
whether
you
meet
anyone
you
think
you
can
like
better
there
is
no
worse
time
for
finding
out
a
mistake
of
that
sort
than
after
marriage
and
so
the
kind
soul
prosed
on
and
would
possibly
have
gone
on
prosing
for
a
few
hours
more
had
i
not
interrupted
one
of
his
sentences
by
saying
i
would
not
have
miss
elmsdale
bound
by
any
engagement
or
consider
herself
other
than
free
as
air
well
well
he
answered
testily
we
understand
that
thoroughly
but
i
suppose
you
do
not
intend
to
cast
the
young
lady
affections
from
you
as
if
they
were
of
no
value
at
this
juncture
her
eyes
and
mine
met
she
smiled
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
too
suppose
we
leave
it
in
this
way
craven
said
addressing
apparently
some
independent
stranger
if
at
the
end
of
a
year
miss
elmsdale
is
of
the
same
mind
let
her
write
to
me
and
say
so
that
course
will
leave
her
free
enough
and
it
will
give
us
twelve
months
in
which
to
turn
round
and
see
what
we
can
do
in
the
way
of
making
his
fortune
i
do
not
imagine
he
will
ever
be
able
to
count
down
guineas
against
her
guineas
or
that
he
wants
to
do
anything
so
absurd
but
he
is
right
in
saying
an
heiress
should
not
marry
a
struggling
clerk
he
ought
to
be
earning
a
good
income
before
he
is
much
older
and
he
shall
or
my
name
is
not
william
craven
i
got
up
and
shook
his
hand
and
helena
kissed
him
tut
tut
fie
fie
what
all
this
he
exclaimed
searching
sedulously
for
his
double
eyeglass
which
all
the
while
he
held
between
his
finger
and
thumb
now
young
people
you
must
not
occupy
my
time
any
longer
harry
see
this
little
lady
into
a
cab
and
you
need
not
return
until
the
afternoon
if
you
are
in
time
to
find
me
before
i
leave
that
will
do
quite
well
miss
helena
i
did
not
take
his
hint
though
failing
to
find
a
cab
perhaps
for
want
of
looking
for
one
i
ventured
to
walk
with
my
beautiful
companion
up
regent
street
as
far
as
oxford
circus
through
what
enchanted
ground
we
passed
in
that
short
distance
how
can
i
ever
hope
to
tell
it
was
all
like
a
story
of
fairyland
with
helena
for
queen
of
unreality
but
it
was
real
enough
ah
my
dear
you
knew
your
own
mind
as
i
after
years
and
years
of
wedded
happiness
can
testify
next
day
craven
started
off
to
the
west
of
england
he
did
not
tell
me
where
he
was
going
indeed
i
never
knew
he
had
been
to
see
my
uncle
until
long
afterwards
what
he
told
that
gentleman
what
he
said
of
me
and
helena
of
my
poor
talents
and
her
beauty
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
old
admiral
agreed
first
to
buy
me
a
partnership
in
some
established
firm
and
then
swore
a
mighty
oath
that
if
the
heiress
was
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
willing
to
marry
his
nephew
he
would
make
him
his
heir
i
should
like
to
have
you
with
me
patterson
said
craven
when
we
were
discussing
my
uncle
proposal
which
a
few
weeks
after
took
me
greatly
by
surprise
but
if
you
remain
here
miss
blake
will
always
regard
you
as
a
clerk
i
know
of
a
good
opening
trust
me
to
arrange
everything
satisfactorily
for
you
whether
miss
blake
even
with
my
altered
fortunes
would
ever
have
become
reconciled
to
the
match
is
extremely
doubtful
had
the
not
turned
a
very
decided
to
the
irish
patriot
helena
of
course
everyone
wanted
but
miss
blake
no
one
wanted
and
the
fact
was
made
very
patent
to
that
lady
they
be
for
parting
you
and
me
my
dear
said
the
poor
creature
one
day
when
society
had
proved
more
than
usually
cruel
if
ever
i
am
let
see
you
after
your
marriage
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
creep
in
at
the
and
make
believe
i
am
some
faithful
old
nurse
wanting
to
have
a
look
at
my
dear
child
sweet
face
no
one
shall
ever
separate
me
from
you
dear
silly
aunt
said
my
charmer
kissing
first
one
of
her
relative
high
and
then
the
other
we
have
to
jog
on
two
old
spinsters
together
then
i
am
thinking
replied
miss
blake
no
was
the
answer
very
distinctly
spoken
i
am
going
to
marry
henry
patterson
and
he
will
not
ask
me
to
part
from
my
ridiculous
foolish
aunt
patterson
that
conceited
clerk
of
william
craven
why
he
has
not
darkened
our
doors
for
fifteen
months
and
more
quite
true
agreed
her
niece
but
nevertheless
i
am
going
to
marry
him
i
asked
him
to
marry
me
a
year
ago
you
do
mane
that
helena
said
poor
miss
blake
you
should
not
talk
like
an
infant
in
arms
we
are
only
waiting
for
your
consent
went
on
my
lady
fair
then
that
you
will
never
have
while
i
retain
my
powers
of
speech
you
shall
not
marry
a
pauper
who
has
only
asked
you
for
the
sake
of
your
money
he
did
not
ask
me
i
asked
him
said
helena
mischievously
and
he
is
not
a
beggar
his
uncle
has
bought
him
a
partnership
and
is
going
to
leave
him
his
money
and
he
will
be
here
himself
to
tell
you
all
about
his
prospects
at
first
miss
blake
refused
to
see
me
but
after
a
time
she
relented
and
thankful
perhaps
to
have
once
again
anyone
over
whom
she
could
tyrannise
treated
her
niece
future
husband
as
helena
declared
most
shamefully
but
you
two
must
learn
to
agree
for
there
shall
be
no
quarrelling
in
our
house
added
the
pretty
autocrat
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
that
helena
said
her
aunt
he
be
just
like
all
the
rest
if
he
civil
to
me
before
marriage
he
wo
be
after
he
will
soon
find
out
there
is
no
place
in
the
house
or
for
that
matter
in
the
world
for
susan
blake
and
my
enemy
for
the
first
time
in
my
memory
fairly
broke
down
and
began
to
whimper
miss
blake
i
said
how
can
i
convince
you
that
i
never
dreamt
never
could
dream
of
asking
you
and
helena
to
separate
see
that
now
and
he
calls
you
helena
already
said
the
lady
reproachfully
well
he
must
begin
sometime
and
that
reminds
me
the
sooner
he
begins
to
call
you
aunt
the
better
i
did
not
begin
to
do
so
then
of
that
the
reader
may
be
quite
certain
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
word
fell
quite
naturally
from
my
lips
for
a
long
period
ours
was
a
hollow
truce
but
as
time
passed
on
and
i
resolutely
refused
to
quarrel
with
miss
blake
she
gradually
ceased
trying
to
pick
quarrels
with
me
our
home
is
very
dear
to
her
all
the
household
management
helena
from
the
first
hour
took
into
her
own
hands
but
in
the
nursery
miss
blake
reigns
supreme
she
has
always
a
grievance
but
she
is
thoroughly
happy
she
dresses
now
like
other
people
and
wears
over
her
gray
hair
caps
of
selection
time
has
softened
some
of
her
prejudices
and
age
renders
her
eccentricities
less
noticeable
but
she
is
still
after
her
fashion
unique
and
we
feel
in
our
home
as
we
used
to
feel
in
the
office
that
we
could
better
spare
a
better
man
the
old
house
was
pulled
down
and
not
a
square
but
a
fine
terrace
occupied
its
site
munro
lives
in
one
of
those
desirable
tenements
and
is
growing
rich
and
famous
day
by
day
craven
has
retired
from
practice
and
taken
a
place
in
the
country
where
he
is
bored
to
death
though
he
professes
himself
charmed
with
the
quiet
helena
and
i
have
always
been
though
the
uninhabited
house
is
never
mentioned
by
either
of
us
she
knows
i
have
still
a
shuddering
horror
of
lonely
places
my
experiences
in
the
uninhabited
house
have
made
me
somewhat
nervous
why
it
was
only
the
other
night
what
are
you
doing
making
all
that
spluttering
on
your
paper
says
an
interrupting
voice
at
this
juncture
and
looking
up
i
see
miss
blake
seated
by
the
window
clothed
and
in
her
right
mind
you
had
better
put
by
that
writing
she
proceeds
with
the
manner
of
one
having
authority
and
i
am
so
amazed
when
i
contrast
miss
blake
as
she
is
with
what
she
was
that
i
at
once
obey
