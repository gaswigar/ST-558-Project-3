this
book
is
above
all
things
the
story
of
a
mother
but
it
is
also
the
story
of
a
noble
woman
a
woman
who
was
truly
great
for
the
reason
that
she
never
sought
to
be
so
because
she
understood
the
sphere
in
which
a
woman
work
in
the
world
must
usually
lie
and
led
her
life
truly
along
the
lines
that
god
had
laid
down
for
her
because
she
suffered
bravely
forgot
herself
for
others
and
remained
faithful
to
her
noble
ideals
she
ruled
as
a
queen
amongst
those
with
whom
her
life
was
cast
her
influence
was
great
and
but
she
herself
was
the
last
to
suspect
it
the
last
to
desire
it
and
that
was
perhaps
the
secret
of
its
greatness
the
type
is
rare
at
the
present
day
but
thank
god
there
are
monicas
still
in
the
world
if
there
were
more
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
chapter
i
how
monica
was
brought
up
by
christian
parents
in
the
city
of
tagaste
on
the
sunny
northern
coast
of
africa
in
the
country
which
we
now
call
algeria
stood
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
a
city
called
tagaste
not
far
distant
lay
the
field
of
zarna
where
the
glory
of
hannibal
had
perished
for
ever
but
rome
had
long
since
avenged
the
sufferings
of
her
bitter
struggle
with
carthage
it
was
the
ambition
of
roman
africa
as
the
new
colony
had
been
called
by
its
conquerors
to
be
if
possible
more
roman
than
rome
every
town
had
its
baths
its
theatre
its
circus
its
temples
its
aqueducts
it
was
forbidden
even
to
exiles
as
a
place
of
refuge
too
much
like
home
said
the
authorities
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
the
church
was
coming
forth
from
her
long
imprisonment
into
the
light
of
day
the
successor
of
constantine
in
name
a
christian
sat
on
the
imperial
throne
the
old
struggle
with
paganism
which
had
lasted
for
four
hundred
years
was
nearly
at
an
end
but
new
dangers
assailed
the
christian
world
men
had
found
that
it
was
easier
to
twist
the
truth
than
to
deny
it
and
heresy
and
schism
were
abroad
in
the
atrium
or
outer
court
of
a
villa
on
the
outskirts
of
tagaste
an
old
woman
and
a
young
girl
sat
together
looking
out
into
the
dark
shadows
of
the
evening
for
the
hot
african
sun
had
sunk
not
long
since
behind
the
numidian
mountains
and
the
day
had
gone
out
like
a
lamp
and
the
holy
bishop
cyprian
asked
the
girl
they
sent
him
into
exile
said
the
old
woman
for
his
father
had
been
a
senator
and
his
family
was
well
known
and
powerful
at
that
time
they
dared
not
put
him
to
death
though
later
he
too
shed
his
blood
for
christ
it
was
god
will
that
he
should
remain
for
many
years
to
strengthen
his
flock
in
the
trial
did
you
ever
see
him
grandmother
asked
the
girl
no
said
the
old
woman
it
was
before
my
time
but
my
mother
knew
him
well
it
was
when
he
was
a
boy
in
carthage
and
still
a
pagan
that
the
holy
martyrs
perpetua
and
felicitas
suffered
with
their
companions
it
was
not
till
years
after
that
he
became
a
christian
but
it
may
have
been
their
death
that
sowed
the
first
seed
in
his
heart
tell
me
said
the
girl
softly
it
was
an
tale
of
which
she
never
tired
her
grandmother
had
lived
through
those
dark
days
of
persecution
and
it
was
the
delight
of
monica
girlhood
to
hear
her
tell
the
stories
of
those
who
had
borne
witness
to
the
faith
in
their
own
land
of
africa
perpetua
was
not
much
older
than
you
said
the
old
woman
she
was
of
noble
race
and
born
of
a
christian
mother
though
her
father
was
a
pagan
she
was
married
and
had
a
little
infant
of
a
few
months
old
when
she
was
called
before
the
tribunal
of
hilarion
the
roman
governor
all
were
touched
by
her
youth
and
beauty
sacrifice
to
the
gods
they
said
you
shall
go
free
am
a
christian
she
answered
and
nothing
more
would
she
say
press
her
as
they
might
her
old
father
hastened
to
her
side
with
the
baby
and
laid
it
in
her
arms
you
leave
your
infant
motherless
he
asked
bring
your
old
father
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
pity
on
the
child
cried
the
bystanders
pity
on
your
father
perpetua
clasped
her
baby
to
her
breast
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
they
thought
she
had
yielded
and
brought
her
the
incense
one
little
grain
on
the
brazier
they
said
you
are
the
child
sake
and
your
old
father
she
pushed
it
from
her
am
a
christian
she
said
will
keep
my
child
she
was
condemned
with
her
companions
to
be
thrown
to
the
wild
beasts
in
the
amphitheatre
and
they
were
taken
away
and
cast
into
a
dark
dungeon
every
day
they
were
tempted
with
promises
of
freedom
to
renounce
the
truth
the
little
babe
of
felicitas
was
born
in
the
prison
where
they
lay
awaiting
death
a
christian
woman
took
the
infant
to
bring
it
up
in
the
faith
the
young
mother
never
saw
the
face
of
her
child
in
this
world
one
word
one
little
motion
of
the
hand
and
they
were
free
restored
again
to
their
happy
life
of
old
and
the
homes
that
were
so
dear
there
were
many
alas
in
those
cruel
days
who
had
not
courage
for
the
fight
who
sacrificed
and
went
their
way
not
so
these
weak
women
once
again
they
brought
perpetua
her
little
child
to
try
to
shake
her
constancy
prison
was
like
a
palace
she
said
while
its
little
downy
head
lay
on
her
breast
her
father
wept
and
even
struck
her
in
his
grief
and
anger
am
a
christian
she
said
and
gave
him
back
the
babe
they
were
thrown
to
the
wild
beasts
felicitas
and
perpetua
who
had
been
tossed
by
a
wild
cow
though
horribly
gored
were
still
alive
gladiators
were
summoned
to
behead
them
felicitas
died
at
the
first
stroke
but
the
man
hand
trembled
and
he
struck
at
perpetua
again
and
again
wounding
her
but
not
mortally
are
more
afraid
than
i
she
said
gently
and
taking
the
point
of
the
sword
held
it
to
her
throat
now
she
said
and
so
passed
into
the
presence
of
her
god
monica
drew
a
long
breath
so
weak
and
yet
so
strong
she
said
so
it
is
my
child
said
the
old
woman
it
is
those
who
are
strong
and
true
in
the
little
things
of
life
who
are
strong
and
true
in
the
great
trials
it
is
hard
to
be
always
strong
and
true
said
the
girl
not
if
god
love
comes
always
first
answered
the
old
woman
monica
was
silent
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
young
life
and
how
with
all
the
safeguards
of
a
christian
home
about
her
she
had
narrowly
escaped
a
great
danger
from
her
babyhood
she
had
been
brought
up
by
her
father
old
nurse
not
perhaps
but
wisely
for
the
city
of
tagaste
was
largely
pagan
in
its
habits
and
the
faithful
old
servant
knew
well
what
temptations
would
surround
her
nursling
in
later
years
monica
though
full
of
life
and
spirit
had
common
sense
and
judgment
beyond
her
years
she
had
also
a
great
love
of
god
and
of
all
that
belonged
to
his
holy
service
and
would
spend
hours
kneeling
in
the
church
in
a
quiet
corner
it
was
there
she
brought
all
her
childish
troubles
and
her
childish
hopes
it
was
to
the
invisible
friend
in
the
sanctuary
that
she
confided
all
the
secrets
of
her
young
heart
and
above
all
that
desire
to
suffer
for
him
and
for
his
church
with
which
the
stories
of
the
martyrs
had
inspired
her
when
the
time
slipped
away
too
fast
and
she
returned
home
late
she
accepted
humbly
the
correction
that
awaited
her
for
she
knew
that
she
had
disobeyed
although
unintentionally
her
nurse
orders
monica
had
been
wilfully
disobedient
once
and
all
her
life
long
she
would
never
forget
the
lesson
her
disobedience
had
taught
her
it
was
a
rule
of
her
old
nurse
that
she
should
take
nothing
to
drink
between
meals
even
in
the
hot
days
of
summer
in
that
sultry
climate
if
she
had
not
courage
to
bear
so
slight
a
mortification
as
that
the
old
woman
would
argue
it
would
go
ill
with
her
in
the
greater
trials
of
life
monica
had
become
used
to
the
habit
but
when
she
was
old
enough
to
begin
to
learn
the
duties
of
housekeeping
her
mother
had
desired
that
she
should
go
every
day
to
the
cellar
to
draw
the
wine
for
the
midday
meal
a
went
with
her
to
carry
the
flagon
and
the
child
feeling
delightfully
important
filled
and
refilled
the
little
cup
which
was
used
to
draw
the
wine
from
the
cask
and
emptied
it
carefully
into
the
when
all
was
finished
a
few
drops
remaining
in
the
cup
a
spirit
of
mischief
took
sudden
possession
of
monica
and
she
drained
it
off
making
a
wry
face
as
she
did
so
at
the
strange
taste
the
laughed
and
continued
to
laugh
when
the
performance
was
repeated
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
the
strange
taste
became
gradually
less
strange
and
less
unpleasant
to
the
young
girl
daily
a
few
drops
were
added
until
at
last
scarcely
thinking
what
she
did
she
would
drink
nearly
the
fill
of
the
little
cup
while
the
servant
laughed
as
of
old
but
monica
was
quick
and
intelligent
and
was
learning
her
household
duties
well
finding
one
day
that
a
piece
of
work
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
maid
who
went
with
her
to
the
was
very
badly
done
she
reproved
her
severely
the
woman
turned
on
her
young
mistress
angrily
it
is
not
for
a
like
you
to
find
fault
with
me
she
retorted
monica
stood
horrified
the
woman
insolent
word
had
torn
the
veil
from
her
eyes
whither
was
she
drifting
into
what
depths
might
that
one
act
of
disobedience
so
lightly
committed
have
led
her
had
not
god
in
his
mercy
intervened
she
never
touched
wine
for
the
rest
of
her
life
unless
largely
diluted
with
water
god
had
taught
her
that
he
who
despises
small
things
shall
fall
by
little
and
little
and
monica
had
learnt
her
lesson
she
had
learnt
to
distrust
herself
and
makes
one
marvellously
gentle
with
others
she
had
learnt
too
to
put
her
trust
in
god
and
trust
in
god
makes
one
marvellously
strong
she
had
been
taught
to
love
the
poor
and
the
suffering
and
to
serve
them
at
her
own
expense
and
inconvenience
and
the
service
of
others
makes
one
unselfish
god
had
work
for
monica
to
do
in
his
world
as
he
has
for
us
all
if
we
will
only
do
it
and
he
had
given
her
what
was
needful
for
her
task
that
night
on
the
way
to
her
chamber
as
the
young
girl
passed
the
place
where
she
had
sat
with
her
grandmother
earlier
in
the
day
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
out
between
the
tall
pillars
into
the
starlit
night
where
the
stood
like
dark
shadows
against
the
deep
deep
blue
of
the
sky
she
clasped
her
hands
and
her
lips
moved
in
prayer
oh
god
she
murmured
to
suffer
for
thee
and
for
thy
faith
god
heard
the
whispered
prayer
and
answered
it
later
there
is
a
living
martyrdom
as
painful
and
as
bitter
as
death
and
monica
was
called
to
taste
it
chapter
ii
how
monica
lived
in
the
pagan
household
of
her
husband
patricius
although
there
were
many
christians
in
roman
africa
pagan
manners
and
customs
still
survived
in
many
of
her
cities
the
people
clung
to
their
games
in
the
circus
the
cruel
and
bloody
combats
of
the
arena
which
though
forbidden
by
constantine
were
still
winked
at
by
provincial
governors
they
scarcely
pretended
to
believe
in
their
religion
but
they
held
to
the
old
pagan
festivals
which
enabled
them
to
enjoy
themselves
without
restraint
under
pretence
of
honouring
the
gods
the
paganism
of
the
fourth
century
with
its
motto
let
us
eat
drink
and
be
merry
imposed
no
it
was
therefore
bound
to
be
popular
but
unrestrained
human
nature
is
a
dangerous
thing
if
men
are
content
to
live
as
the
beasts
that
perish
they
fall
as
far
below
their
level
as
god
meant
them
to
rise
above
it
and
the
roman
empire
was
falling
to
pieces
through
its
own
corruption
in
africa
the
worship
of
the
old
punic
gods
to
whom
living
children
used
to
be
offered
in
sacrifice
had
still
its
votaries
and
priests
of
saturn
and
astarte
with
their
long
hair
and
painted
faces
and
scarlet
robes
were
still
to
be
met
dancing
madly
in
procession
through
the
streets
of
carthage
the
various
heretical
sects
had
their
preachers
everywhere
proclaiming
that
there
were
much
easier
ways
of
serving
christ
than
that
taught
by
the
catholic
church
it
was
hard
for
the
christian
bishops
to
keep
their
flocks
untainted
for
there
were
enemies
on
every
side
vvhen
monica
was
years
old
her
parents
gave
her
in
marriage
to
a
citizen
of
tagaste
called
patricius
he
held
a
good
position
in
the
town
for
he
belonged
to
a
family
which
though
poor
was
noble
monica
knew
little
of
her
future
husband
save
that
he
was
nearly
twice
her
age
and
a
pagan
but
it
was
the
custom
for
parents
to
arrange
all
such
matters
and
she
had
only
to
obey
a
little
surprise
was
perhaps
felt
in
tagaste
that
such
good
christians
should
choose
a
pagan
husband
for
their
beautiful
daughter
but
it
was
found
impossible
to
shake
their
hopeful
views
for
the
future
when
it
was
objected
that
patricius
was
well
known
for
his
violent
temper
even
amongst
his
own
associates
they
answered
that
he
would
learn
gentleness
when
he
became
a
christian
that
things
might
go
hard
with
their
daughter
in
the
meantime
they
did
not
seem
to
foresee
monica
took
her
new
trouble
where
she
had
been
used
to
take
the
old
kneeling
in
her
favourite
corner
in
the
church
she
asked
help
and
counsel
of
the
friend
who
never
fails
she
had
had
her
girlish
ideals
of
love
and
marriage
she
had
dreamt
of
a
strong
arm
on
which
she
could
lean
of
a
heart
and
soul
that
would
be
at
one
with
her
in
all
that
was
most
dear
of
two
lives
spent
together
in
god
love
and
service
and
now
it
seemed
that
it
was
she
who
would
have
to
be
strong
for
both
to
strive
and
to
suffer
to
bring
her
husband
soul
out
of
darkness
into
the
light
of
truth
would
she
succeed
and
if
not
what
would
be
that
married
life
which
lay
before
her
she
did
not
dare
to
think
she
must
not
fail
and
yet
thou
in
me
o
lord
she
prayed
again
and
again
through
her
tears
it
was
late
when
she
made
her
way
homewards
and
that
night
kneeling
at
her
bedside
she
laid
the
ideals
of
her
girlhood
at
the
feet
of
him
who
lets
no
sacrifice
however
small
go
unrewarded
she
would
be
true
to
this
new
trust
she
resolved
cost
what
it
might
things
certainly
did
not
promise
well
for
the
young
happiness
patricius
lived
with
his
mother
a
woman
of
strong
passions
like
himself
and
devoted
to
her
son
she
was
bitterly
jealous
of
the
young
girl
who
had
stolen
his
affections
and
had
made
up
her
mind
to
dislike
her
the
slaves
of
the
household
followed
of
course
their
mistress
lead
and
tried
to
please
her
by
inventing
stories
against
monica
patricius
who
loved
his
young
wife
with
the
only
kind
of
love
of
which
he
was
capable
had
nothing
in
common
with
her
and
had
no
clue
to
her
thoughts
or
actions
he
had
neither
reverence
nor
respect
for
women
indeed
most
of
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
were
deserving
of
neither
and
he
had
chosen
monica
for
her
beauty
much
as
he
would
have
chosen
a
horse
or
a
dog
he
thought
her
ways
and
ideas
extraordinary
she
took
as
kindly
an
interest
in
the
slaves
as
if
they
had
been
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
and
would
even
intercede
to
spare
them
a
beating
she
liked
the
poor
and
would
gather
these
dirty
and
unpleasant
people
about
her
going
so
far
even
as
to
wash
and
dress
their
sores
patricius
did
not
share
her
attraction
and
objected
strongly
to
such
proceedings
but
monica
pleaded
so
humbly
and
sweetly
that
he
gave
way
and
let
her
do
what
seemed
to
cause
her
so
much
pleasure
there
was
no
accounting
for
tastes
he
remarked
she
would
spend
hours
in
the
church
praying
with
her
great
eyes
fixed
on
the
altar
true
she
was
never
there
at
any
time
when
she
was
likely
to
be
missed
by
her
husband
and
never
was
she
so
full
of
tender
affection
for
him
as
when
she
came
home
but
still
it
was
a
strange
way
of
spending
one
time
there
was
something
about
monica
it
is
true
that
was
altogether
unlike
any
other
inmate
of
the
house
as
she
went
about
her
daily
duties
always
watching
for
the
chance
of
doing
a
kind
action
when
patricius
was
in
one
of
his
violent
tempers
shouting
abusing
and
even
striking
everybody
who
came
in
his
way
she
would
look
at
him
with
gentle
eyes
that
showed
neither
fear
nor
anger
she
never
answered
sharply
even
though
his
rude
words
wounded
her
cruelly
he
had
once
raised
his
hand
to
strike
her
but
he
had
not
dared
something
he
did
not
know
what
withheld
him
later
when
his
anger
had
subsided
and
he
was
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
of
his
violence
she
would
meet
him
with
an
affectionate
smile
forgiving
and
forgetting
all
only
if
he
spoke
himself
and
touched
at
her
generous
forbearance
tried
shamefacedly
to
make
amends
for
his
treatment
of
her
would
she
gently
explain
her
conduct
more
often
she
said
nothing
knowing
that
actions
speak
more
loudly
than
words
as
her
greatest
biographer
says
of
her
she
spoke
little
preached
not
at
all
loved
much
and
prayed
unceasingly
when
the
young
wives
of
her
acquaintance
married
like
herself
to
pagan
husbands
complained
of
the
insults
and
even
blows
which
they
had
to
bear
are
you
sure
your
own
tongue
is
not
to
blame
she
would
ask
them
laughingly
and
then
with
ready
sympathy
would
do
all
she
could
to
help
and
comfort
and
advise
they
would
ask
her
secret
for
everyone
knew
that
in
spite
of
the
violence
of
temper
he
treated
her
with
something
that
almost
approached
respect
then
she
would
bid
them
be
patient
and
love
and
pray
and
meet
harshness
with
gentleness
and
abuse
with
silence
and
when
they
sometimes
answered
that
it
would
seem
weak
to
knock
under
in
such
a
fashion
monica
would
ask
them
if
they
thought
it
needed
more
strength
to
speak
or
to
be
silent
when
provoked
and
which
was
easier
to
smile
or
to
sulk
when
insulted
many
homes
were
happier
in
consequence
for
monica
had
a
particular
gift
for
making
peace
and
even
as
a
child
had
settled
the
quarrels
of
her
young
companions
to
everybody
satisfaction
to
the
outside
world
patricius
young
wife
seemed
contented
and
happy
she
managed
her
affairs
well
people
said
and
no
one
but
god
knew
of
the
suffering
that
was
her
secret
and
his
brought
up
in
the
peace
and
piety
of
a
christian
family
she
had
had
no
idea
of
the
miseries
of
paganism
now
she
had
ample
opportunity
to
study
the
effects
of
unchecked
selfishness
and
of
uncontrolled
passions
to
see
how
low
human
nature
unrestrained
by
faith
and
love
could
fall
her
treated
her
with
suspicion
and
dislike
for
the
slaves
never
weary
of
inventing
fresh
stories
against
her
misrepresented
all
her
actions
to
their
mistress
monica
did
not
seem
to
notice
unkindness
repaying
the
many
insults
she
received
with
little
services
tactfully
rendered
but
she
felt
it
deeply
they
do
not
know
she
would
say
to
herself
and
pray
for
them
all
the
more
earnestly
offering
her
sufferings
for
these
poor
souls
who
were
so
far
from
the
peace
of
christ
how
was
the
light
to
come
to
them
if
not
through
her
how
could
they
learn
to
love
christ
unless
they
learned
to
love
his
servants
and
to
see
him
in
them
the
revelation
must
come
through
her
if
it
was
to
come
at
all
thou
in
me
o
lord
she
would
pray
and
draw
strength
and
courage
at
his
feet
for
the
daily
suffering
the
heart
of
patricius
was
like
a
neglected
garden
germs
of
generosity
of
nobility
lay
hidden
under
a
rank
growth
of
weeds
that
no
one
had
ever
been
at
any
trouble
to
clear
away
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
held
him
captive
with
monica
he
was
always
at
his
best
but
he
grew
weary
of
being
at
his
best
it
was
so
much
easier
to
be
at
his
worst
he
gradually
began
to
seek
distractions
amongst
his
old
pagan
companions
in
the
old
ignoble
pleasures
the
whole
town
began
to
talk
of
his
neglect
of
his
beautiful
young
wife
monica
suffered
cruelly
but
in
silence
when
he
was
at
home
which
was
but
seldom
she
was
serene
and
gentle
as
usual
she
never
reproached
him
and
treated
him
with
the
same
tender
deference
as
of
old
patricius
felt
the
charm
of
her
presence
all
that
was
good
in
him
responded
but
evil
habits
had
gone
far
to
stifle
the
good
and
his
lower
nature
cried
out
for
base
enjoyments
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
break
the
chain
which
held
him
so
monica
wept
and
prayed
in
secret
and
god
sent
a
ray
of
sunshine
to
brighten
her
sad
life
three
children
were
born
to
her
during
the
early
years
of
her
marriage
the
name
of
augustine
her
eldest
son
will
be
for
ever
associated
with
that
of
his
mother
of
the
other
two
navigius
and
perpetua
his
sister
we
know
little
navigius
delicate
in
health
was
of
a
gentle
and
pious
nature
both
he
and
perpetua
married
but
the
latter
after
her
husband
death
entered
a
monastery
with
her
younger
children
monica
had
no
trouble
it
was
the
eldest
augustine
who
after
having
been
for
long
the
son
of
her
sorrow
and
of
her
prayers
was
destined
to
be
at
last
her
glory
and
her
joy
chapter
iii
how
monica
brought
up
her
children
and
how
the
little
augustine
fell
sick
and
desired
baptism
as
soon
as
the
little
augustine
was
born
his
mother
had
him
taken
to
the
christian
church
that
the
sign
of
the
cross
might
be
made
on
his
forehead
and
that
he
might
be
entered
amongst
the
catechumens
it
was
a
custom
of
the
time
never
approved
of
by
the
church
to
put
off
baptism
until
the
catechumen
had
shown
himself
able
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
the
society
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
to
live
through
this
mistaken
idea
of
reverence
for
the
sacrament
the
young
soldier
of
christ
lest
he
should
tarnish
his
weapons
in
the
fight
was
sent
unarmed
into
a
conflict
in
which
he
needed
all
the
strength
which
the
sacraments
alone
can
give
the
outlook
for
monica
with
her
pagan
husband
and
her
pagan
household
was
darker
than
for
most
christian
mothers
her
heart
grew
heavy
within
her
as
she
held
her
young
son
in
her
arms
and
thought
of
the
future
for
the
present
indeed
he
was
hers
but
later
when
she
could
no
longer
keep
him
at
her
side
and
surround
him
with
a
love
and
protection
what
dangers
would
beset
him
the
influence
of
an
unbelieving
father
during
the
years
when
his
boyish
ideas
of
life
would
be
forming
a
household
that
knew
not
christ
how
could
he
pass
untouched
through
the
dangers
that
would
assail
his
young
soul
with
prayers
and
tears
monica
bent
over
the
unconscious
little
head
that
lay
so
peacefully
upon
her
breast
commending
her
babe
to
the
heavenly
father
to
whom
all
things
are
possible
augustine
drank
in
the
love
of
christ
with
his
mother
milk
he
tells
us
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
she
taught
him
to
lisp
a
prayer
as
soon
as
he
could
understand
she
taught
him
in
language
suited
to
his
childish
sense
the
great
truths
of
the
christian
faith
he
would
listen
eagerly
and
standing
at
his
mother
knee
or
nestling
in
her
arms
follow
the
sweet
voice
that
could
make
the
highest
things
so
simple
to
his
childish
understanding
it
was
the
that
was
later
to
bear
such
glorious
fruit
though
the
long
days
of
winter
lay
between
the
boy
was
thoughtful
and
intelligent
he
loved
all
that
was
great
and
good
and
noble
the
loathing
of
what
was
mean
and
base
and
unlovely
breathed
into
him
by
his
mother
in
those
days
of
early
childhood
haunted
him
even
during
his
worst
moments
in
later
life
the
cry
that
burst
from
his
soul
in
manhood
when
he
had
drunk
deeply
of
the
cup
of
earthly
joys
and
found
it
bitter
and
unsatisfying
had
its
origin
in
those
early
teachings
thou
hast
made
us
for
thyself
o
god
and
our
hearts
can
find
no
rest
until
they
rest
in
thee
one
day
when
the
child
was
about
seven
years
old
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
sickness
he
was
in
great
pain
and
soon
became
so
ill
that
his
life
was
in
danger
his
parents
were
in
anguish
but
augustine
one
thought
was
for
his
soul
he
begged
and
prayed
that
he
might
receive
baptism
monica
added
her
entreaties
to
his
patricius
yielded
all
was
prepared
when
the
child
suddenly
got
better
then
someone
intervened
probably
his
father
for
augustine
tells
us
that
the
baptism
was
put
off
again
indefinitely
but
it
was
time
to
think
of
the
boy
education
and
it
was
proposed
to
send
him
to
school
in
tagaste
it
was
a
pagan
school
to
which
the
child
must
go
pagan
authors
that
he
must
study
and
worse
than
all
pagan
conversation
that
he
must
hear
and
pagan
playmates
with
whom
he
must
associate
patricius
was
proud
of
the
beauty
and
the
intelligence
of
his
little
son
and
hoped
great
things
for
the
future
but
augustine
early
were
far
from
brilliant
eager
as
the
boy
was
to
learn
what
interested
him
he
had
an
insurmountable
dislike
to
anything
that
caused
him
trouble
it
bored
him
to
learn
to
read
and
write
and
the
uninspiring
truth
that
two
and
two
make
four
was
a
weariness
of
the
flesh
to
him
though
the
stories
of
virgil
enchanted
him
homer
he
never
thoroughly
enjoyed
nor
quite
forgave
for
had
he
not
for
his
sake
been
forced
to
wade
through
the
chilly
waters
of
the
greek
grammar
unfortunately
for
augustine
such
dismal
truths
as
two
and
two
make
four
have
to
be
mastered
before
higher
flights
can
be
attempted
the
tagaste
schoolmasters
had
but
one
way
of
sharpening
their
zeal
for
learning
the
liberal
use
of
the
rod
now
augustine
disliked
beatings
as
much
as
he
disliked
all
other
unpleasant
things
but
he
also
disliked
work
the
only
way
of
evading
both
disagreeables
was
to
follow
the
example
of
the
greater
number
of
his
to
play
when
he
should
have
been
working
and
to
tell
clever
lies
to
his
schoolmasters
and
his
parents
in
order
to
escape
punishment
such
tricks
however
are
bound
to
be
found
out
sooner
or
later
and
monica
realizing
that
much
could
be
got
out
of
her
son
by
love
but
little
by
fear
took
him
for
a
course
of
instruction
to
the
christian
priests
that
he
might
learn
to
overcome
himself
for
the
love
of
god
as
a
result
augustine
took
more
earnestly
to
his
prayers
asking
above
all
however
that
he
might
not
be
beaten
at
school
his
mother
finding
him
one
day
praying
in
a
quiet
corner
to
this
intent
suggested
that
if
he
had
learnt
his
lessons
for
the
day
he
need
have
no
fear
but
if
he
had
not
punishment
was
to
be
expected
patricius
who
was
passing
and
overheard
the
conversation
laughed
at
his
fears
and
agreed
with
his
wife
augustine
thought
them
both
exceedingly
heartless
as
the
boy
grew
older
however
his
wonderful
gifts
began
to
show
themselves
and
his
masters
seeing
of
what
he
was
really
capable
punished
him
yet
more
severely
when
he
was
idle
augustine
too
began
to
take
pride
in
his
own
success
and
to
wish
to
be
first
amongst
his
young
companions
the
latter
cheated
as
a
matter
of
course
both
in
work
and
at
play
bad
habits
are
catching
and
augustine
would
sometimes
cheat
too
when
found
out
he
would
fly
into
a
passion
although
no
one
was
so
severe
on
the
dishonesty
of
others
as
he
and
yet
though
he
would
often
yield
to
the
temptations
that
were
the
hardest
for
his
nature
to
resist
there
was
much
that
was
good
in
the
boy
he
had
a
faithful
and
loving
heart
an
attraction
for
all
that
was
great
and
noble
he
was
in
fact
his
mother
son
as
well
as
his
father
the
tares
and
the
wheat
were
sprouting
side
by
side
but
augustine
was
rapidly
growing
out
of
childhood
patricius
prouder
than
ever
of
his
clever
son
resolved
to
spare
no
pains
to
give
him
the
best
education
that
his
means
could
procure
the
boy
had
a
great
gift
of
eloquence
said
his
masters
and
much
judgment
he
would
be
certain
to
succeed
brilliantly
at
the
bar
it
was
decided
to
send
him
to
madaura
a
town
about
twenty
miles
distant
a
good
deal
larger
than
tagaste
and
well
known
for
its
culture
and
its
schools
it
was
one
of
the
most
pagan
of
the
cities
of
africa
but
this
was
an
objection
that
had
no
weight
with
patricius
although
it
meant
much
to
monica
the
only
comfort
for
her
in
the
thought
of
this
first
separation
was
that
there
at
least
her
son
would
not
be
far
from
home
not
far
away
in
truth
as
distance
goes
but
how
far
away
in
spirit
madaura
was
a
large
and
handsome
city
with
a
circus
and
theatre
and
a
fine
forum
or
set
round
with
statues
of
the
gods
it
was
proud
of
its
reputation
for
learning
but
had
little
else
to
be
proud
of
its
professors
were
men
who
were
more
ashamed
of
being
detected
in
a
fault
of
style
than
in
the
grossest
crimes
who
were
ashamed
indeed
of
nothing
else
the
pagan
gods
were
held
up
to
their
scholars
as
models
for
admiration
and
imitation
it
was
a
poor
ideal
at
the
best
the
gods
were
represented
by
the
great
pagan
poets
and
authors
as
no
better
if
more
powerful
than
ordinary
mortals
they
were
subject
to
all
the
meannesses
and
all
the
baseness
of
the
least
noble
of
their
worshippers
that
their
adventures
neither
moral
nor
elevating
were
told
in
the
most
exquisite
language
by
the
greatest
authors
of
antiquity
rather
added
to
the
danger
than
decreased
it
true
the
noblest
of
the
classical
writers
broke
away
continually
from
the
bondage
which
held
them
to
stretch
out
groping
hands
towards
the
eternal
truth
and
beauty
into
which
real
genius
must
always
have
some
insight
but
not
all
were
noble
the
students
of
madaura
were
worthy
of
their
masters
nothing
was
too
shameful
to
be
talked
about
if
only
it
were
talked
about
in
phrases
the
plays
acted
in
the
theatre
were
what
might
be
expected
in
roman
society
of
the
fourth
century
that
society
from
which
anthony
and
jerome
had
been
forced
to
flee
to
the
desert
in
order
to
save
their
souls
augustine
won
golden
opinions
from
his
masters
for
his
quickness
and
intelligence
they
thought
of
nothing
else
but
of
cultivating
the
minds
of
their
scholars
heart
and
soul
were
left
untouched
or
touched
in
such
a
way
that
evil
sprang
to
life
and
good
was
stifled
he
was
a
genius
they
cried
a
budding
rhetorician
a
poet
although
masters
and
scholars
alike
applauded
him
augustine
while
he
drank
their
praises
greedily
was
restless
and
unhappy
he
had
gone
down
before
the
subtle
temptations
of
madaura
like
corn
before
the
scythe
first
evil
thoughts
but
carelessly
resisted
then
evil
deeds
he
had
lost
his
childish
innocence
and
with
it
his
childish
happiness
for
he
knew
too
much
and
was
too
noble
of
nature
to
be
content
with
what
was
ignoble
the
seeds
of
his
mother
teaching
were
yet
alive
within
him
and
monica
only
twenty
miles
away
at
tagaste
she
was
praying
for
her
son
beseeching
the
heavenly
father
to
keep
him
from
evil
to
watch
over
him
now
that
she
was
no
longer
at
his
side
hoping
and
trusting
that
all
was
well
with
her
boy
chapter
iv
how
monica
by
her
gentleness
and
charity
won
patricius
and
his
mother
to
christ
of
all
the
hidden
forces
in
the
world
perhaps
the
most
mysterious
is
what
we
call
influence
for
good
or
for
evil
to
a
lesser
or
a
greater
degree
it
goes
out
from
each
one
of
us
and
has
its
effect
on
all
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
it
is
like
a
subtle
breath
that
braces
the
spirit
to
good
or
relaxes
it
to
evil
but
never
leaves
it
untouched
or
unmoved
no
man
liveth
to
himself
alone
said
paul
who
had
many
opportunities
of
watching
the
workings
of
that
mysterious
force
in
the
world
and
of
studying
its
effects
according
as
we
follow
our
best
and
noblest
instincts
or
to
use
a
homely
but
vivid
phrase
let
ourselves
go
consciously
or
unconsciously
we
give
an
upward
lift
or
a
downward
push
to
all
who
come
in
contact
with
us
happily
for
us
all
god
does
not
ask
of
us
attainment
but
effort
and
earnest
effort
is
the
simple
secret
of
healthy
influence
monica
it
is
true
was
a
saint
but
a
saint
in
the
making
saints
are
not
born
holiness
is
a
beautiful
thing
that
is
built
up
stone
by
stone
not
brought
into
being
by
the
touch
of
the
enchanter
wand
during
the
years
that
had
passed
since
patricius
had
brought
his
young
wife
home
to
his
mother
house
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
confess
how
far
she
had
fallen
short
of
the
ideal
she
had
set
herself
to
attain
and
yet
there
had
been
ceaseless
effort
ceaseless
prayer
unwearying
love
and
patience
outwardly
all
seemed
as
usual
but
the
hidden
force
had
been
doing
its
work
in
secret
as
it
always
does
the
mother
of
patricius
was
growing
old
she
was
neither
so
active
nor
so
strong
as
she
had
been
what
had
used
to
be
easy
to
her
was
becoming
difficult
it
galled
her
independent
spirit
to
be
obliged
to
ask
help
of
others
monica
reading
her
heart
as
only
the
unselfish
can
saw
this
and
understood
at
every
moment
the
older
woman
would
find
that
some
little
service
had
been
done
by
unseen
hands
some
little
thoughtful
act
that
made
things
easier
for
the
tired
old
limbs
there
was
someone
who
seemed
to
know
and
understand
what
she
wanted
almost
before
she
did
herself
who
could
it
be
not
the
slaves
certainly
they
did
their
duty
for
fear
of
being
beaten
but
that
was
all
it
was
all
indeed
that
was
expected
of
them
not
patricius
either
it
was
not
his
way
he
never
thought
of
such
things
it
could
therefore
be
no
one
but
monica
the
old
woman
mused
deeply
she
had
treated
her
harshly
and
unkindly
during
all
these
years
she
had
looked
upon
her
as
an
intruder
but
then
the
slaves
had
told
her
unpleasant
stories
of
their
young
mistress
it
was
only
what
she
deserved
and
yet
it
was
hard
to
think
of
those
ugly
tales
in
connection
with
monica
as
she
herself
knew
her
as
she
had
seen
her
day
by
day
since
she
came
first
a
young
bride
to
her
husband
home
again
how
had
monica
repaid
her
for
her
unkindness
with
charity
and
sweetness
with
gentle
respect
and
deference
to
her
wishes
never
trying
to
assert
herself
never
appealing
to
her
husband
to
give
her
the
place
which
of
right
belonged
to
her
she
had
been
content
to
be
treated
as
the
last
in
the
house
the
old
woman
sat
lost
in
thought
what
would
the
house
be
like
she
suddenly
asked
herself
without
that
gentle
presence
what
would
she
do
what
would
they
all
do
without
monica
with
a
sudden
pang
of
sorrow
she
realized
how
much
she
leant
upon
her
what
her
life
would
be
without
her
she
considered
the
matter
in
this
new
light
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
passions
but
of
sound
common
sense
reason
was
beginning
to
triumph
over
prejudice
sending
for
the
slaves
she
questioned
them
sharply
as
to
the
tales
they
had
told
her
about
their
young
mistress
they
faltered
contradicted
each
other
and
themselves
in
the
end
confessed
that
they
had
lied
the
old
lady
went
straight
to
her
son
and
told
him
the
whole
story
patricius
was
not
one
to
take
half
measures
in
such
a
matter
not
even
the
prayers
of
monica
all
unconscious
of
the
particular
offence
they
had
committed
availed
to
save
the
culprits
they
were
as
soundly
beaten
as
they
had
ever
been
in
their
lives
after
which
they
were
told
that
they
knew
what
to
expect
if
they
ever
breathed
another
word
against
their
young
mistress
again
as
it
happened
they
had
no
desire
to
do
so
the
hidden
forces
had
been
working
there
too
monica
kindness
her
sympathy
with
their
joys
and
sorrows
to
them
something
strange
and
new
had
already
touched
their
hearts
more
than
once
they
had
been
sorry
for
ever
having
spoken
against
her
they
had
felt
ashamed
in
her
presence
justice
having
been
done
on
the
slaves
the
mother
of
patricius
sought
out
her
told
her
frankly
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
asked
her
forgiveness
monica
clasped
the
old
woman
in
her
arms
and
refused
to
listen
from
that
moment
they
were
the
truest
of
friends
there
were
many
things
to
be
spoken
of
but
first
religion
monica
had
revealed
her
faith
by
her
life
her
daily
actions
and
to
the
other
it
was
a
beautiful
and
alluring
revelation
she
wanted
to
know
to
understand
she
listened
eagerly
to
monica
explanations
it
was
a
message
of
new
life
of
hope
beyond
the
grave
of
joy
of
peace
she
begged
to
be
received
as
a
catechumen
it
was
not
long
before
she
knelt
at
monica
side
before
the
altar
to
be
signed
on
the
brow
with
the
cross
of
christ
the
joyous
of
the
seed
that
had
been
sown
in
tears
one
by
one
the
slaves
followed
their
mistress
example
hungering
in
their
turn
for
the
message
that
brought
such
peace
and
light
to
suffering
and
weary
souls
was
it
for
such
as
they
they
asked
and
monica
answered
that
it
was
for
all
that
the
master
himself
had
chosen
to
be
as
one
that
served
the
whole
household
was
christian
now
with
the
exception
of
patricius
and
even
he
was
growing
daily
more
gentle
more
thoughtful
the
mysterious
forces
were
working
on
him
too
his
love
for
monica
was
more
reverent
his
eyes
were
opening
slowly
to
the
beauty
of
spiritual
things
the
old
life
with
its
old
pleasures
was
growing
distasteful
to
him
he
saw
its
baseness
while
as
yet
he
could
scarcely
tear
himself
free
from
its
fetters
the
fetters
of
old
habit
so
hard
to
break
he
noticed
the
change
in
his
mother
and
her
her
courage
he
even
envied
the
slaves
their
happy
faces
the
new
light
that
shone
in
their
eyes
and
that
gave
them
a
strange
new
dignity
monica
watching
the
struggle
redoubled
her
prayers
her
unselfish
love
surrounded
her
husband
like
an
atmosphere
of
light
and
sweetness
drawing
him
with
an
invincible
power
to
better
things
she
would
speak
to
him
of
their
children
above
all
of
augustine
their
the
admiration
of
his
masters
at
madaura
he
was
astonishing
everybody
they
wrote
by
his
brilliant
gifts
he
had
the
soul
of
a
poet
and
the
eloquence
of
an
orator
he
would
do
great
things
madaura
had
been
all
very
well
up
till
now
his
father
decided
but
everything
must
be
done
to
give
their
boy
a
good
start
in
life
they
must
go
farther
afield
rome
was
impossible
the
distance
was
too
great
and
the
expense
too
heavy
patricius
means
were
limited
but
he
resolved
to
do
his
utmost
for
his
eldest
son
carthage
had
a
reputation
for
culture
and
for
learning
that
was
second
only
to
that
of
rome
if
strict
economy
were
practised
at
home
carthage
might
be
possible
in
the
meantime
it
was
not
much
use
leaving
the
boy
at
madaura
let
him
come
home
and
remain
there
a
year
during
which
he
could
study
privately
while
they
saved
the
money
to
pay
his
expenses
at
carthage
the
suggestion
delighted
monica
she
would
have
her
son
with
her
for
a
whole
year
she
would
be
able
to
watch
over
him
just
when
he
needed
her
motherly
care
she
looked
forward
eagerly
to
augustine
return
the
old
intimate
life
they
had
led
together
before
he
went
to
madaura
would
begin
again
again
her
boy
would
hang
on
her
arm
and
tell
her
all
his
hopes
and
dreams
for
the
future
hopes
and
dreams
into
which
she
always
entered
of
which
she
was
always
part
she
would
look
once
more
into
the
boy
clear
eyes
while
he
confessed
to
her
his
faults
and
failings
and
see
the
light
flame
up
in
them
as
she
told
him
of
noble
and
heroic
deeds
and
urged
him
to
be
true
to
his
ideals
and
so
in
happy
dreams
the
days
went
past
until
augustine
return
but
there
was
bitter
grief
in
store
for
monica
this
was
not
the
same
augustine
that
they
had
left
at
madaura
two
years
ago
the
days
of
the
old
familiar
friendship
seemed
to
have
gone
past
recall
his
eyes
no
longer
turned
to
her
with
the
old
candour
he
shunned
her
questioning
look
he
shunned
her
company
even
and
seemed
more
at
ease
with
his
father
who
was
proud
beyond
words
of
his
tall
handsome
son
he
was
all
right
said
patricius
he
was
growing
up
that
was
all
boys
could
not
always
be
tied
to
their
mother
the
moment
that
monica
had
so
dreaded
for
augustine
had
come
then
the
pagan
influences
had
been
at
work
oh
why
had
she
let
him
go
to
madaura
and
yet
it
had
to
be
so
his
father
had
insisted
she
made
several
efforts
to
break
through
the
wall
of
reserve
that
augustine
had
built
up
between
himself
and
her
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
had
other
plans
now
into
which
she
did
not
enter
other
thoughts
far
away
how
far
away
from
hers
a
dark
cloud
was
between
them
one
day
she
persuaded
her
son
to
go
out
with
her
the
spring
had
just
come
that
wonderful
african
spring
when
the
whole
world
seems
suddenly
to
burst
into
flower
asphodels
stood
on
either
side
of
the
path
in
which
they
walked
the
fragrance
of
the
springtime
was
in
their
nostrils
the
golden
sunlight
bathed
the
rainbow
earth
it
was
a
walk
that
they
had
loved
to
take
of
old
to
delight
together
in
all
the
beauty
of
that
world
which
god
had
made
monica
spoke
gently
to
her
son
of
the
new
life
that
lay
before
him
of
the
dangers
that
beset
his
path
he
must
hold
fast
to
the
law
of
christ
she
told
him
he
must
be
pure
and
strong
and
true
there
was
no
answering
gleam
as
of
old
the
boy
listened
with
a
bad
grace
shame
and
honour
were
tugging
at
his
but
in
vain
the
better
self
was
defeated
for
the
lower
self
was
growing
stronger
every
day
woman
talk
he
said
to
himself
i
am
no
longer
a
child
they
turned
back
through
the
glorious
sights
and
sounds
of
the
springtime
there
was
a
dagger
in
monica
heart
on
the
threshold
she
met
patricius
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
he
said
she
slipped
her
arm
into
his
smiling
through
her
pain
and
they
went
back
again
between
the
nodding
asphodels
and
the
hedges
of
wisteria
along
the
path
she
had
just
trodden
with
her
son
there
was
an
unwonted
seriousness
about
patricius
he
had
been
thinking
deeply
of
late
he
told
her
he
had
begun
to
see
things
in
a
new
light
it
was
dim
as
yet
and
he
was
still
weak
but
the
old
life
and
the
old
religion
had
grown
hateful
to
him
her
god
was
the
true
god
he
wanted
to
know
how
to
love
and
serve
that
god
of
hers
was
he
fit
did
she
think
to
learn
could
he
be
received
as
a
catechumen
the
new
joy
fell
like
balm
on
the
new
sorrow
monica
had
lost
her
son
but
gained
her
husband
god
was
good
he
had
heard
her
prayers
he
had
accepted
her
sacrifice
surely
he
would
give
her
back
her
boy
she
would
trust
on
and
hope
he
will
withhold
no
good
thing
from
them
that
ask
him
a
few
days
later
patricius
knelt
beside
her
at
the
altar
her
heart
overflowed
with
joy
and
thankfulness
they
were
one
at
last
one
in
soul
in
faith
a
few
steps
distant
knelt
augustine
what
thoughts
were
in
his
heart
was
it
the
last
struggle
between
good
and
evil
was
the
influence
of
his
mother
the
love
of
christ
she
had
instilled
into
him
in
his
childhood
making
one
last
stand
against
the
influences
that
had
swayed
him
in
madaura
that
still
swayed
him
the
influences
of
the
corrupt
world
in
which
he
lived
we
do
not
know
if
it
was
so
the
evil
triumphed
chapter
v
how
augustine
went
to
carthage
and
how
patricius
died
a
christian
death
augustine
year
at
home
did
not
do
for
him
what
monica
had
hoped
his
old
pagan
schoolfellows
gathered
round
him
he
was
always
with
them
the
happy
seemed
to
have
lost
its
charm
the
want
of
principle
and
of
honour
in
most
of
them
disgusted
him
in
his
better
moments
nevertheless
he
was
content
to
enjoy
himself
in
their
company
he
was
even
ashamed
when
they
boasted
of
their
misdoings
to
seem
more
innocent
than
they
and
would
pretend
to
be
worse
than
he
really
was
lest
his
prestige
should
suffer
in
their
eyes
there
were
moments
when
he
loathed
it
all
and
longed
for
the
old
life
with
its
innocent
pleasures
but
it
is
hard
to
turn
back
on
the
downhill
road
he
tells
us
how
he
went
one
night
with
a
band
of
these
wild
companions
to
rob
the
of
a
poor
neighbour
it
was
laden
with
pears
but
they
were
not
very
good
they
did
not
care
to
eat
them
and
threw
them
to
the
pigs
it
was
not
schoolboy
greed
that
prompted
the
theft
but
the
pure
delight
of
doing
evil
of
tricking
the
owner
of
the
garden
there
was
the
wild
excitement
too
of
the
daring
the
fear
that
they
might
be
caught
in
the
act
he
was
careful
to
keep
such
escapades
a
secret
from
his
mother
but
monica
was
uneasy
knowing
what
might
be
expected
from
the
companions
her
son
had
chosen
patricius
was
altogether
unable
to
give
augustine
the
help
that
he
needed
the
christian
ideals
of
life
and
conduct
were
new
to
him
as
yet
the
old
pagan
ways
seemed
only
natural
he
was
scarcely
likely
to
be
astonished
at
the
fact
that
his
son
boyhood
was
rather
like
what
his
own
had
been
he
was
standing
it
is
true
on
the
threshold
of
the
church
but
her
teaching
was
not
yet
clear
to
him
his
own
feet
were
not
firm
enough
in
the
ways
of
christ
to
enable
him
to
stretch
a
steadying
hand
to
another
his
mother
was
failing
fast
the
end
could
not
be
far
off
monica
was
devoting
herself
heart
and
soul
to
the
old
woman
who
clung
to
her
with
tender
affection
and
was
never
happy
in
her
absence
patricius
watched
them
together
and
marvelled
at
the
effects
of
the
grace
of
baptism
was
that
indeed
his
mother
he
asked
himself
that
gentle
patient
old
woman
so
thoughtful
for
others
so
ready
to
give
up
her
own
will
she
had
used
to
be
violent
and
headstrong
like
himself
resentful
and
implacable
in
her
dislikes
but
now
she
was
more
like
monica
than
like
him
that
was
monica
way
though
her
sweetness
and
patience
seemed
to
be
catching
she
was
like
the
sunshine
penetrating
everywhere
with
its
light
and
warmth
he
alas
was
far
behind
his
mother
catechumen
though
he
was
the
old
temper
would
often
flash
out
still
was
the
hardest
task
that
he
had
ever
undertaken
and
sometimes
he
almost
lost
heart
and
was
inclined
to
give
it
up
altogether
then
monica
would
gently
remind
him
that
with
god
help
the
hardest
things
were
possible
and
they
would
kneel
and
pray
together
and
patricius
would
take
heart
again
for
the
fight
she
had
a
wonderful
gift
for
giving
people
courage
patricius
had
noticed
that
before
he
supposed
it
was
because
she
was
so
full
of
sympathy
and
always
made
allowances
and
then
she
seemed
to
think
to
be
sure
even
that
if
one
went
on
trying
failures
did
not
matter
god
did
not
mind
them
and
that
was
a
very
comforting
reflection
for
poor
weak
people
like
himself
to
go
on
trying
was
possible
even
for
him
although
he
knew
he
could
not
always
promise
himself
success
patricius
was
anxious
about
augustine
future
all
his
efforts
had
not
succeeded
in
saving
the
sum
required
for
his
first
year
at
carthage
he
had
discovered
that
it
would
cost
a
good
deal
more
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
and
it
was
difficult
to
see
where
the
money
was
to
come
from
it
was
at
this
moment
that
romanianus
a
wealthy
and
honourable
citizen
of
tagaste
who
knew
the
poverty
of
his
friend
came
forward
generously
and
put
his
purse
at
patricius
disposal
the
sum
required
was
offered
with
such
delicacy
that
it
could
not
be
declined
augustine
was
sure
to
bring
glory
on
his
native
town
said
romanianus
it
was
an
honour
to
be
allowed
to
help
in
his
education
monica
was
almost
glad
to
see
her
son
depart
the
old
boyish
laziness
had
given
way
to
a
real
zeal
for
learning
and
thirst
after
knowledge
the
idle
life
at
home
was
certainly
the
worst
thing
for
him
hard
work
and
the
pursuit
of
wisdom
might
steady
his
wild
nature
and
bring
him
back
to
god
it
was
her
only
hope
now
as
with
prayers
and
tears
she
besought
of
him
to
watch
over
her
son
but
monica
did
not
know
carthage
if
it
was
second
only
to
rome
for
its
culture
and
its
schools
it
almost
rivalled
rome
in
its
corruption
there
all
that
was
worst
in
the
civilization
of
the
east
and
of
the
west
met
and
mingled
the
bloody
combats
between
men
and
beasts
the
gladiatorial
shows
that
delighted
the
romans
were
free
to
all
who
chose
to
frequent
the
amphitheatre
of
carthage
such
plays
as
the
romans
delighted
in
impossible
to
describe
were
acted
in
the
theatre
the
horrible
rites
of
the
eastern
religions
were
practised
openly
there
was
neither
discipline
nor
order
in
the
schools
the
wealthier
students
gloried
in
their
bad
reputation
they
were
young
men
of
fashion
who
were
capable
of
anything
and
who
were
careful
to
let
others
know
it
they
went
by
the
name
of
smashers
or
upsetters
from
their
habit
of
raiding
the
schools
of
professors
whose
teaching
they
did
not
approve
and
breaking
everything
on
which
they
could
lay
hands
they
treated
with
coarse
brutality
but
augustine
seems
in
some
manner
to
have
escaped
their
enmity
perhaps
a
certain
dignity
in
the
young
man
bearing
or
perhaps
his
brilliant
gifts
won
their
respect
for
he
surpassed
them
all
in
intelligence
and
speedily
outstripped
them
in
class
augustine
was
eager
for
knowledge
and
eager
for
enjoyment
he
frequented
the
theatre
his
nature
snatched
at
everything
that
life
could
give
yet
he
was
not
happy
my
god
he
cried
in
later
years
with
what
bitter
gall
didst
thou
in
thy
great
mercy
sprinkle
those
pleasures
of
mine
he
could
not
forget
and
at
tagaste
his
mother
was
weeping
and
praying
for
her
son
patricius
prayed
with
her
he
understood
at
last
every
day
the
germs
of
a
noble
nature
that
had
lain
so
long
dormant
within
him
were
gaining
strength
and
life
every
day
his
soul
was
opening
more
and
more
to
the
understanding
of
spiritual
things
while
monica
watched
the
transformation
with
a
heart
that
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
love
the
sorrows
of
the
past
were
all
forgotten
in
the
joy
of
the
present
that
happy
union
at
the
feet
of
christ
there
was
but
one
cause
for
sadness
patricius
health
was
failing
his
mother
had
already
shown
him
the
joys
of
a
christian
deathbed
she
had
passed
away
smiling
with
their
hands
in
hers
and
the
name
of
jesus
on
her
lips
the
beautiful
prayers
of
the
church
had
gone
down
with
the
departing
soul
to
the
threshold
of
the
new
life
and
had
followed
it
into
eternity
she
seemed
close
to
them
still
in
the
light
of
that
wonderful
new
faith
and
to
be
waiting
for
them
in
their
everlasting
home
but
monica
happiness
was
to
be
for
it
seemed
that
patricius
would
soon
rejoin
his
mother
he
did
not
deceive
himself
he
spoke
of
his
approaching
death
to
monica
and
asked
her
to
help
him
to
make
a
worthy
preparation
for
baptism
which
he
desired
to
receive
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
simplicity
and
trustfulness
of
a
child
he
looked
to
her
for
guidance
and
did
all
that
she
desired
the
ceremony
over
he
turned
to
his
wife
and
smiled
a
wonderful
peace
possessed
him
the
old
life
with
all
its
stains
had
passed
from
him
in
those
cleansing
waters
the
new
life
was
at
hand
once
more
he
asked
her
to
forgive
him
all
the
pain
he
had
caused
her
all
that
he
had
made
her
suffer
no
she
must
not
grieve
he
told
her
the
parting
would
be
but
for
a
little
while
the
meeting
for
all
eternity
she
had
been
his
angel
he
said
he
owed
all
his
joy
to
her
it
was
her
love
her
patience
that
had
done
it
all
she
had
shown
him
the
beauty
of
goodness
and
made
him
love
it
he
thanked
her
for
all
that
she
had
been
to
him
all
that
she
had
shown
him
all
that
she
had
done
for
him
her
tears
fell
on
his
face
her
loving
arms
supported
him
her
sweet
voice
broken
with
weeping
spoke
words
of
hope
and
comfort
on
the
threshold
of
that
other
world
monica
bade
farewell
to
her
husband
and
one
more
soul
that
she
had
won
for
christ
went
out
into
a
glorious
eternity
chapter
vi
how
monica
lived
in
the
days
of
her
widowhood
and
how
she
put
all
her
trust
in
god
patricius
had
not
much
in
the
way
of
worldly
goods
to
leave
to
his
wife
she
needed
little
it
is
true
for
herself
but
there
was
augustine
would
it
be
possible
for
her
even
if
she
practised
the
strictest
economy
to
keep
him
at
carthage
where
he
was
doing
so
well
romanianus
divined
her
anxiety
and
hastened
to
set
it
at
rest
he
had
a
house
in
carthage
he
said
it
should
be
augustine
as
long
as
he
required
it
this
would
settle
the
question
of
lodging
for
the
rest
continued
romanianus
as
an
old
friend
of
patricius
he
had
the
right
to
befriend
his
son
and
monica
must
grant
him
the
privilege
of
acting
a
father
part
to
augustine
until
he
was
fairly
launched
in
life
he
had
a
child
of
his
own
a
young
son
called
licentius
if
monica
would
befriend
his
boy
they
would
be
quits
the
gratitude
of
both
mother
and
son
towards
this
generous
friend
and
benefactor
lasted
throughout
their
lives
licentius
was
to
feel
its
effects
more
than
once
you
it
was
romanianus
wrote
augustine
in
his
confessions
who
when
i
was
a
poor
young
student
in
carthage
opened
to
me
your
house
your
purse
and
still
more
your
heart
you
it
was
who
when
i
had
the
sorrow
to
lose
my
father
comforted
me
by
your
friendship
helped
me
with
your
advice
and
assisted
me
with
your
fortune
monica
mourned
her
husband
death
with
true
devotion
but
hers
was
not
a
selfish
sorrow
she
had
love
and
sympathy
for
all
who
needed
them
and
forgot
her
own
grief
in
solacing
that
of
others
there
were
certain
good
works
which
the
church
gave
to
christian
widows
to
perform
the
hospitals
for
instance
were
entirely
in
their
hands
they
were
small
as
yet
built
according
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
from
the
funds
of
the
faithful
and
held
but
few
patients
these
devoted
women
succeeded
each
other
at
intervals
in
their
task
of
washing
and
attending
to
the
sick
watching
by
their
beds
and
cleaning
their
rooms
their
ministrations
did
not
even
cease
there
with
reverent
care
they
prepared
the
dead
for
burial
thinking
the
while
of
the
preparation
of
christ
body
for
the
tomb
and
of
him
who
said
inasmuch
as
ye
do
it
to
the
least
of
my
brethren
ye
do
it
unto
me
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
monica
when
her
turn
came
to
serve
the
sick
she
would
kiss
their
sores
for
very
pity
as
she
washed
and
dressed
them
and
their
faces
grew
bright
at
her
coming
they
called
her
mother
it
seemed
such
a
natural
name
to
give
her
for
she
was
a
mother
to
them
all
and
gave
them
a
mother
love
to
some
of
the
poor
creatures
friendless
slaves
as
they
often
were
who
had
known
little
sympathy
or
tenderness
in
their
hard
lives
it
was
a
revelation
of
christianity
which
taught
them
more
than
hours
of
preaching
could
have
done
but
there
was
other
work
besides
that
at
the
hospital
there
were
the
poor
to
be
helped
the
hungry
to
be
fed
the
naked
to
be
clothed
she
would
gather
the
orphan
children
at
her
knee
to
teach
them
the
truths
of
their
faith
when
they
were
very
poor
she
would
keep
them
in
her
own
house
feed
them
at
her
own
table
and
clothe
them
with
her
own
hands
if
i
am
a
mother
to
these
motherless
ones
she
would
say
to
herself
he
will
have
mercy
and
give
me
back
my
boy
if
i
teach
them
to
know
and
love
him
as
a
father
he
will
watch
over
my
son
it
was
a
custom
of
the
time
on
the
feasts
of
saints
and
martyrs
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
their
tombs
with
a
little
basket
of
food
and
wine
this
was
laid
on
the
grave
after
which
the
faithful
would
partake
of
what
they
had
brought
while
they
thought
and
spoke
of
the
noble
lives
of
god
servants
who
had
gone
before
the
custom
was
abolished
not
long
after
on
account
of
the
abuses
which
had
arisen
but
monica
observed
it
to
the
end
she
scarcely
tasted
of
her
offering
herself
but
gave
it
all
away
to
the
poor
often
indeed
she
went
cold
and
hungry
that
they
might
be
clothed
and
fed
her
love
of
prayer
too
could
now
find
full
scope
every
morning
found
her
in
her
place
in
church
for
the
holy
sacrifice
every
evening
she
was
there
again
silent
absorbed
in
god
the
place
where
she
knelt
was
often
wet
with
her
tears
the
time
passed
by
unheeded
patricius
her
husband
was
safe
in
god
hands
but
augustine
her
her
darling
in
what
dark
paths
was
he
wandering
and
yet
in
her
heart
of
hearts
there
was
a
deep
conviction
that
no
sad
news
of
his
life
at
carthage
could
shake
his
was
not
the
nature
to
find
contentment
in
the
things
of
earth
he
was
born
to
something
higher
his
noble
heart
his
strong
intelligence
would
bring
him
back
to
god
and
yet
and
yet
her
heart
sank
as
she
thought
of
graces
wasted
of
conscience
trampled
underfoot
of
light
rejected
no
there
was
no
hope
anywhere
but
with
god
in
him
she
would
trust
and
in
him
alone
he
was
infinite
in
mercy
and
strong
to
save
he
had
promised
that
he
would
never
fail
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him
at
his
feet
and
at
his
feet
alone
monica
poured
out
her
tears
and
her
sorrow
with
others
she
was
serene
and
hopeful
as
of
old
even
joyous
always
ready
to
help
and
comfort
it
was
said
of
her
after
her
death
that
no
one
had
such
a
gift
of
helping
others
as
she
she
never
preached
at
people
most
people
have
an
insurmountable
dislike
to
being
preached
at
but
every
word
she
said
had
a
strange
power
of
drawing
souls
to
god
of
making
them
wish
to
be
better
augustine
meanwhile
at
carthage
was
justifying
all
the
hopes
that
had
been
formed
of
him
he
had
even
greater
gifts
it
seemed
than
eloquence
feeling
and
wit
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
class
in
rhetoric
his
master
had
spoken
to
him
of
a
certain
treatise
of
aristotle
which
he
would
soon
be
called
upon
to
study
it
was
so
profound
he
said
that
few
could
understand
it
even
with
the
help
of
the
most
learned
professors
augustine
eager
to
make
acquaintance
with
this
wonderful
work
procured
it
at
once
and
read
it
it
seemed
to
him
perfectly
simple
it
was
unnecessary
he
found
to
ask
a
single
explanation
it
was
the
same
with
geometry
music
every
science
he
took
up
this
young
genius
of
nineteen
only
discovered
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
when
he
had
to
teach
others
and
realized
how
hard
it
was
to
make
them
understand
what
was
so
exceedingly
simple
to
himself
there
was
something
strangely
sympathetic
and
attractive
about
augustine
he
seemed
modest
and
reserved
about
his
own
gifts
although
he
himself
tells
us
in
his
that
he
was
full
of
pride
and
ambition
he
had
a
gift
of
making
true
and
faithful
friends
a
charm
in
conversation
that
drew
his
young
companions
and
even
older
men
to
his
side
a
more
worldly
mother
than
monica
would
have
been
thoroughly
proud
of
her
son
faith
and
virtue
were
alone
weak
and
faint
in
that
soul
that
could
so
ill
do
without
them
but
to
her
they
were
the
one
essential
thing
the
rest
did
not
matter
yet
monica
with
true
insight
believed
that
with
noble
minds
knowledge
must
draw
men
to
god
she
hoped
much
therefore
that
augustine
brilliance
of
intellect
would
save
him
in
the
end
and
her
hopes
were
not
deceived
already
the
noble
philosophy
of
cicero
pagan
though
he
was
had
awakened
a
thirst
for
wisdom
in
the
young
student
soul
already
he
felt
the
emptiness
of
earthly
joys
i
longed
my
god
he
writes
to
fly
from
the
things
of
earth
to
thee
and
i
knew
not
that
it
was
thou
that
wast
working
in
me
one
thing
cooled
my
ardour
he
goes
on
to
say
it
was
that
the
name
of
christ
was
not
there
and
this
name
by
thy
mercy
lord
of
thy
son
my
saviour
my
heart
had
drawn
in
with
my
mother
milk
and
kept
in
its
depths
and
every
doctrine
where
this
name
did
not
appear
fluent
elegant
and
though
it
might
be
could
not
master
me
altogether
he
then
turned
to
the
holy
scriptures
but
they
appeared
to
him
inferior
in
style
to
cicero
my
pride
he
writes
despised
the
manner
in
which
the
things
are
said
and
my
intelligence
could
not
discover
the
hidden
sense
they
become
great
only
for
the
humble
and
i
disdained
to
humble
myself
and
inflated
with
vainglory
i
believed
myself
great
it
was
at
this
moment
that
he
came
in
contact
with
the
manicheans
whose
errors
attracted
him
at
once
this
extraordinary
heresy
had
begun
in
the
east
and
had
spread
all
over
the
civilized
world
its
followers
formed
a
secret
society
with
signs
and
passwords
grades
and
initiations
to
impose
on
christians
they
used
christian
words
for
doctrines
that
were
thoroughly
unchristian
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
them
was
their
hatred
of
the
church
augustine
who
remained
amongst
them
for
nine
years
thus
describes
them
when
writing
to
a
friend
thou
knowest
honoratus
that
for
this
reason
alone
did
we
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
men
namely
that
they
professed
to
free
us
from
all
errors
and
bring
us
to
god
by
pure
reason
alone
without
that
terrible
principle
of
authority
for
what
else
induced
me
to
abandon
the
faith
of
my
childhood
and
follow
these
men
for
almost
nine
years
but
their
assertion
that
we
were
terrified
by
superstition
into
a
faith
blindly
imposed
upon
our
reason
while
they
urged
no
one
to
believe
until
the
truth
was
fully
discussed
and
proved
who
would
not
be
seduced
by
such
promises
especially
if
he
were
a
proud
contentious
young
man
thirsting
for
truth
such
as
they
then
found
me
that
was
what
the
manicheans
promised
what
augustine
found
amongst
them
he
also
tells
us
they
incessantly
repeated
to
me
truth
but
there
was
no
truth
in
them
they
taught
what
was
false
not
only
about
thee
my
god
who
art
the
very
truth
but
even
about
the
elements
of
this
world
thy
creatures
so
much
for
their
doctrines
as
for
the
teachers
themselves
he
found
them
carnal
and
loquacious
full
of
insane
pride
the
great
charm
of
manicheism
to
augustine
was
that
it
taught
that
a
man
was
not
responsible
for
his
sins
this
doctrine
was
convenient
to
one
who
could
not
find
the
strength
to
break
with
his
bad
habits
such
was
my
mind
he
sums
up
later
looking
back
on
this
period
of
his
life
so
weighed
down
so
blinded
by
the
flesh
that
i
was
myself
unknown
to
myself
chapter
vii
how
monica
heart
was
well
nigh
broken
by
the
news
that
her
son
had
abjured
the
christian
faith
ill
news
travels
fast
augustine
had
scarcely
joined
the
manicheans
before
the
tidings
reached
monica
at
first
she
could
hardly
believe
it
this
was
a
blow
for
which
she
had
not
been
prepared
it
crushed
her
to
the
earth
she
would
have
grieved
less
over
the
news
of
her
son
death
and
yet
she
bent
her
broken
heart
to
god
will
and
hoped
on
in
him
whose
mercy
can
not
fail
augustine
had
renounced
the
faith
of
his
childhood
publicly
she
heard
later
he
had
been
entered
by
the
manicheans
as
an
auditor
the
first
degree
of
initiation
in
their
sect
and
with
all
the
zeal
and
ardour
that
he
carried
into
everything
he
did
he
was
advocating
this
abominable
heresy
and
persuading
his
companions
to
follow
his
example
her
eyes
grew
dim
with
weeping
for
her
son
he
was
dead
indeed
to
god
that
god
who
was
her
all
in
all
the
vacation
was
near
and
augustine
would
then
return
to
tagaste
perhaps
she
would
find
that
it
was
not
so
bad
as
she
had
thought
it
might
be
only
the
whim
of
a
moment
she
would
wait
and
see
alas
the
hope
was
vain
augustine
had
scarcely
been
a
day
at
home
before
he
began
obstinately
to
air
his
new
opinions
determined
that
she
should
listen
then
the
christian
in
monica
rose
above
the
mother
her
horror
of
heresy
was
for
the
moment
stronger
than
her
love
for
her
son
standing
before
him
outraged
and
indignant
she
told
him
plainly
that
if
he
spoke
in
such
a
way
she
could
no
longer
receive
him
at
her
table
or
in
her
house
augustine
was
amazed
he
had
found
out
at
last
the
limits
of
his
mother
endurance
with
bent
head
he
left
the
house
and
sought
the
hospitality
of
romanianus
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
monica
heart
melted
the
surged
up
again
with
bitter
tears
she
cried
on
god
to
help
her
her
grief
seemed
greater
than
she
could
bear
at
last
the
night
came
and
with
it
peace
as
she
slept
exhausted
with
weeping
she
had
a
dream
which
brought
her
a
strange
sense
of
hope
and
comfort
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
standing
on
a
narrow
rule
or
plank
of
wood
her
heart
weighed
down
with
sorrow
as
it
had
been
all
through
the
day
suddenly
there
came
towards
her
a
young
man
radiant
and
fair
of
face
smiling
at
her
he
asked
the
cause
of
her
tears
i
am
weeping
she
answered
for
the
loss
of
my
son
grieve
no
more
then
he
replied
for
look
your
son
is
standing
there
beside
you
monica
turned
her
head
it
was
true
augustine
stood
at
her
side
on
the
plank
of
wood
be
of
good
cheer
continued
the
stranger
for
where
you
are
there
shall
he
be
also
then
monica
awoke
the
words
were
ringing
in
her
ears
it
seemed
to
her
that
god
had
spoken
in
the
morning
she
went
straight
to
augustine
and
told
him
of
her
dream
perhaps
suggested
her
son
anxious
to
turn
it
to
his
own
advantage
it
means
that
you
will
come
to
see
things
as
i
do
no
said
monica
firmly
for
he
did
not
say
is
shall
be
but
are
there
shall
be
augustine
was
even
more
struck
by
the
earnestness
of
his
answer
than
by
the
dream
itself
though
he
pretended
to
make
light
of
both
not
long
after
monica
went
to
see
a
certain
holy
bishop
that
she
might
beg
him
to
use
his
influence
with
augustine
to
bring
him
back
to
the
truth
the
wise
old
man
listened
attentively
to
her
story
let
him
alone
for
the
present
but
pray
much
was
his
advice
for
as
yet
he
is
obstinate
and
puffed
up
with
these
new
ideas
if
what
you
tell
me
of
your
son
is
true
he
will
read
for
himself
and
will
find
out
his
error
then
seeing
the
anguish
of
the
poor
mother
he
told
her
that
he
himself
in
his
youth
had
been
led
away
by
the
manicheans
and
had
even
been
employed
in
transcribing
their
works
it
was
that
which
had
saved
him
for
as
he
wrote
the
truth
became
clear
to
him
he
had
seen
how
much
their
doctrines
were
to
be
avoided
then
as
monica
wept
for
disappointment
for
she
had
counted
greatly
on
his
help
a
sudden
pity
seized
him
go
thy
ways
and
god
bless
thee
he
cried
it
is
impossible
that
a
son
of
such
tears
should
perish
monica
dream
and
the
words
of
the
bishop
were
like
rays
of
light
in
the
darkness
she
drew
fresh
hope
from
them
and
redoubled
her
prayers
the
vacation
drew
to
an
end
and
augustine
returned
to
carthage
but
not
for
long
he
was
now
twenty
years
old
his
friend
and
patron
romanianus
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
open
a
school
in
tagaste
while
waiting
for
something
better
and
this
he
resolved
to
do
a
little
circle
of
pupils
soon
gathered
round
him
who
were
later
to
follow
their
young
master
in
all
his
wanderings
amongst
these
was
alypius
an
old
schoolfellow
and
a
devoted
friend
the
sons
of
romanianus
and
another
friend
of
augustine
childhood
whose
name
we
do
not
know
but
who
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
rest
they
were
of
the
same
age
had
studied
together
had
the
same
tastes
and
the
same
ambitions
influenced
by
augustine
still
warm
in
the
praise
of
the
manicheans
he
as
well
as
the
rest
had
abjured
the
catholic
faith
to
join
their
heresy
augustine
had
been
about
a
year
at
tagaste
when
this
friend
was
taken
suddenly
ill
he
lay
unconscious
in
a
burning
fever
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
of
recovery
he
had
been
a
catechumen
before
he
had
joined
the
manicheans
his
parents
who
were
christians
having
begged
that
he
might
be
baptized
before
he
died
the
waters
were
poured
on
him
as
he
lay
between
life
and
death
augustine
made
no
protest
so
sure
was
he
that
what
he
himself
had
taught
him
before
he
was
taken
ill
would
have
more
influence
than
a
rite
administered
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
to
everybody
surprise
the
young
man
recovered
his
senses
and
began
to
mend
augustine
then
laughingly
told
him
what
they
had
been
doing
and
went
on
to
make
fun
of
the
whole
proceeding
never
doubting
but
that
the
sick
man
would
enjoy
the
joke
as
much
as
he
did
to
his
great
surprise
his
friend
turned
from
him
in
horror
never
speak
to
me
in
such
a
way
again
if
you
wish
to
keep
my
affection
he
said
we
will
talk
this
matter
out
when
you
are
stronger
thought
augustine
but
a
few
days
later
the
invalid
had
a
relapse
and
died
with
the
white
robe
of
his
baptism
still
unstained
augustine
was
inconsolable
everything
in
tagaste
reminded
him
of
the
dear
companion
of
his
boyhood
my
own
country
became
a
punishment
to
me
he
writes
and
my
father
house
a
misery
and
all
places
or
things
in
which
i
had
communicated
with
him
were
turned
into
a
bitter
torment
to
me
being
now
without
him
my
eyes
sought
him
everywhere
and
i
hated
all
things
because
they
had
him
not
the
thought
of
death
was
full
of
horror
to
him
and
he
gave
way
to
a
deep
depression
his
health
never
very
robust
began
to
suffer
romanianus
much
as
he
wished
to
keep
him
at
tagaste
realized
that
a
change
of
scene
would
be
the
best
thing
for
him
and
agreed
to
his
proposal
to
return
to
carthage
and
open
a
school
of
rhetoric
alypius
and
his
other
disciples
followed
him
and
in
the
rush
of
the
great
city
augustine
regained
to
some
extent
his
peace
of
mind
while
teaching
he
continued
his
own
studies
and
competed
for
the
public
prizes
many
men
of
note
joined
his
school
and
his
name
began
to
be
famous
he
greatly
desired
honour
he
tells
us
but
only
if
honourably
won
one
day
a
certain
magician
paid
him
a
visit
he
had
heard
he
said
that
augustine
was
about
to
compete
for
one
of
the
state
prizes
in
rhetoric
what
would
he
be
ready
to
give
if
he
could
insure
him
the
victory
it
was
only
necessary
to
offer
some
living
creatures
in
sacrifice
to
the
demons
whom
he
worshipped
and
success
would
be
certain
augustine
turned
from
him
in
horror
and
disgust
he
had
not
yet
fallen
so
low
as
this
i
would
not
sacrifice
a
fly
he
retorted
hotly
to
win
a
crown
of
gold
the
magician
retired
in
haste
and
augustine
who
succeeded
in
carrying
off
the
prize
without
the
help
of
the
demons
was
publicly
crowned
by
the
vindicius
who
from
thenceforth
joined
the
circle
of
his
friends
the
news
of
his
success
reached
monica
her
mother
heart
rejoiced
in
his
triumph
but
her
joy
was
tempered
with
sorrow
carthage
had
taken
more
from
her
son
than
it
could
ever
give
him
and
her
thoughts
were
of
other
victories
and
other
crowns
during
his
stay
in
tagaste
although
augustine
had
not
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
his
mother
he
had
been
continually
with
her
her
tender
affection
had
been
his
greatest
comfort
in
the
deep
sorrow
after
his
friend
death
he
spoke
no
more
to
her
of
religion
and
she
mindful
of
the
old
bishop
words
was
also
silent
while
i
was
struggling
in
the
mire
and
in
the
darkness
of
error
writes
augustine
that
holy
chaste
devout
and
sober
widow
such
as
thou
lovest
ceased
not
in
all
the
hours
of
her
prayers
to
bewail
me
in
thy
sight
and
her
prayers
were
admitted
into
thy
presence
and
yet
thou
sufferedst
me
to
go
on
still
and
to
be
involved
in
that
darkness
the
darkness
was
indeed
great
but
the
fires
were
still
smouldering
beneath
the
ashes
love
honour
and
success
were
all
his
and
yet
he
was
not
content
there
was
something
in
his
soul
that
none
of
these
things
could
satisfy
after
thee
o
truth
he
cries
i
hungered
and
thirsted
his
heart
still
ached
for
the
loss
of
his
friend
he
turned
everywhere
for
comfort
and
found
none
he
sought
forgetfulness
in
study
he
wrote
two
books
on
the
beautiful
and
the
apt
and
dedicated
them
to
hierus
a
famous
roman
orator
it
seemed
to
me
a
great
thing
he
tells
us
that
my
style
and
my
studies
should
be
known
to
such
a
man
monica
drew
fresh
hope
from
her
son
writings
they
were
full
of
noble
thoughts
and
high
aspirations
such
a
mind
could
not
remain
in
error
some
day
surely
in
god
good
time
he
would
come
to
know
the
truth
chapter
viii
how
augustine
planned
to
go
to
rome
and
how
he
cruelly
deceived
his
mother
it
was
about
this
time
that
augustine
enthusiasm
for
the
manicheans
began
to
cool
he
had
been
studying
their
doctrines
and
had
found
that
they
were
not
quite
what
he
thought
he
was
disappointed
with
their
professors
too
the
first
unpleasant
truth
that
dawned
upon
him
was
that
they
were
much
better
at
denying
the
doctrines
of
the
catholic
church
than
at
explaining
their
own
it
was
almost
impossible
to
find
out
what
they
believed
so
vague
did
they
become
when
closely
questioned
and
augustine
questioned
very
closely
indeed
he
was
on
the
track
of
truth
and
it
was
not
easy
to
put
him
off
with
hazy
general
statements
he
was
still
only
an
auditor
and
before
he
took
any
further
step
he
wanted
to
be
certain
of
his
ground
the
men
whom
he
consulted
did
not
seem
very
certain
of
their
own
he
remarked
but
they
bade
him
have
patience
one
of
their
bishops
faustus
by
name
was
soon
coming
to
carthage
he
was
one
of
their
most
brilliant
preachers
and
would
be
able
to
answer
all
augustine
questions
this
sounded
promising
and
augustine
awaited
his
coming
impatiently
he
certainly
was
an
eloquent
speaker
his
sermons
were
charming
but
when
augustine
went
to
him
privately
and
explained
his
doubts
to
him
the
result
was
not
what
he
had
hoped
for
he
gave
the
same
vague
answers
that
augustine
had
so
often
heard
already
pressed
closer
he
frankly
replied
that
he
was
not
learned
enough
to
be
able
to
satisfy
him
augustine
was
pleased
with
his
honesty
and
they
became
good
friends
but
the
seeker
was
no
nearer
the
truth
than
before
yet
if
faustus
could
not
answer
him
which
of
the
manicheans
could
he
began
to
lose
faith
in
them
what
did
the
catholic
church
teach
on
these
points
he
asked
this
was
a
question
which
they
could
all
answer
and
did
with
great
eagerness
and
little
truth
it
might
have
occurred
to
a
less
intelligent
man
than
augustine
that
the
enemies
of
the
church
were
not
the
people
to
answer
such
a
question
fairly
or
truthfully
but
he
accepted
their
facts
and
decided
that
truth
was
not
to
be
found
there
either
was
there
such
a
thing
at
all
was
the
final
question
he
asked
himself
the
old
philosophers
heathens
as
they
were
seemed
to
get
nearer
to
the
heart
of
things
than
this
yet
now
and
again
out
of
the
very
sickness
of
his
soul
a
prayer
would
break
out
to
that
christ
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
in
his
boyhood
but
who
had
grown
so
dim
to
him
since
the
manicheans
had
taught
him
that
his
sacred
humanity
was
nothing
but
a
shadow
he
was
weary
of
life
weary
even
of
pleasure
weary
of
everything
weary
most
of
all
of
carthage
owing
to
the
wild
ways
of
the
students
it
was
impossible
to
keep
anything
like
order
in
the
schools
classes
were
constantly
interrupted
by
gangs
of
smashers
who
might
break
in
at
any
moment
setting
the
whole
place
in
an
uproar
augustine
friends
pressed
him
to
go
to
rome
there
they
urged
he
would
meet
with
the
honour
that
he
deserved
there
the
students
were
quieter
and
no
rioting
was
allowed
scholars
might
enter
no
school
but
that
of
their
own
master
this
sounded
hopeful
augustine
was
rather
pleased
with
the
idea
he
wrote
to
monica
and
to
his
patron
romanianus
to
tell
them
of
the
step
he
proposed
to
take
monica
heart
sank
when
she
read
the
letter
to
the
christians
of
the
fourth
century
rome
was
another
babylon
she
had
poured
out
the
blood
of
the
saints
like
water
she
was
the
home
of
every
abomination
what
would
become
of
augustine
in
rome
without
faith
without
ideals
a
disabled
ship
drifting
with
every
wind
he
must
not
go
she
decided
or
if
he
did
she
would
go
with
him
she
prayed
that
she
might
be
able
to
make
him
give
up
the
project
and
wrote
strongly
against
it
but
augustine
had
already
made
up
his
mind
then
in
despair
she
set
out
for
carthage
to
make
one
last
effort
her
son
was
touched
by
her
grief
and
her
entreaties
but
his
plans
were
made
he
was
to
start
that
very
night
i
lied
to
my
mother
he
says
and
such
a
mother
he
assured
her
that
he
was
not
going
that
she
might
set
her
mind
at
rest
a
friend
of
his
was
leaving
carthage
and
he
had
promised
to
go
down
to
the
harbour
to
see
him
off
some
instinct
warned
monica
that
he
was
deceiving
her
i
will
go
with
you
she
said
this
was
very
awkward
for
her
son
he
was
at
his
wit
end
to
know
what
to
do
they
went
down
to
the
harbour
together
where
they
found
augustine
friend
no
ship
could
put
out
that
night
the
sailors
said
the
wind
was
dead
against
them
the
young
men
were
unwilling
to
leave
the
harbour
in
case
the
wind
should
change
and
they
should
miss
the
boat
while
monica
was
determined
not
to
leave
augustine
they
walked
up
and
down
together
on
the
seashore
in
the
cool
evening
air
the
hours
passed
and
the
situation
became
more
and
more
difficult
for
augustine
what
was
he
to
do
monica
was
weary
and
worn
out
with
grief
an
idea
suggested
itself
to
him
suddenly
it
was
no
use
waiting
any
longer
he
said
it
would
be
better
to
take
some
rest
the
boat
would
certainly
not
start
that
night
monica
was
in
no
mood
to
rest
but
augustine
knew
her
love
of
prayer
there
was
a
little
chapel
on
the
seashore
dedicated
to
cyprian
would
she
not
at
least
go
there
and
take
shelter
until
the
morning
he
promised
her
again
that
he
would
not
leave
carthage
and
she
at
last
consented
for
her
soul
was
full
of
sorrow
kneeling
there
in
the
stillness
of
the
little
chapel
she
poured
out
the
troubles
of
her
heart
to
god
beseeching
him
that
he
would
not
let
augustine
leave
her
the
answer
seemed
a
strange
one
as
she
prayed
the
wind
suddenly
changed
the
sailors
prepared
to
depart
augustine
and
his
friend
went
on
board
and
the
ship
set
sail
for
rome
the
last
thing
they
saw
as
the
shore
faded
away
in
the
dim
grey
of
the
morning
was
the
little
chapel
of
cyprian
lying
like
a
speck
in
the
distance
but
they
did
not
see
a
lonely
figure
that
stood
on
the
sand
and
stretched
out
piteous
hands
to
heaven
wailing
for
the
son
whom
she
had
lost
a
second
time
it
was
god
alone
who
knew
all
the
bitterness
of
that
mother
heart
it
was
god
alone
who
knew
how
after
the
first
uncontrollable
outburst
of
grief
she
bent
herself
in
faith
and
love
to
endure
the
heartbreak
silent
and
uncomplaining
and
it
was
only
god
who
knew
that
the
parting
that
seemed
so
cruel
was
to
lead
to
the
granting
of
her
prayer
to
be
the
first
stage
in
her
son
conversion
she
turned
herself
to
thee
to
pray
for
me
says
augustine
and
went
about
her
accustomed
affairs
and
i
arrived
at
rome
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
his
arrival
in
rome
was
destined
to
be
the
end
of
his
earthly
career
for
soon
afterwards
he
was
attacked
by
a
violent
fever
and
lay
at
death
door
he
was
lodging
in
the
house
of
a
manichean
for
although
he
no
longer
held
with
their
doctrines
he
had
many
friends
among
them
in
carthage
who
had
recommended
him
to
some
of
their
sect
in
rome
augustine
himself
was
convinced
that
he
owed
his
life
at
this
time
to
his
mother
prayers
god
would
not
for
her
sake
let
him
be
cut
off
thus
in
all
his
sins
unbaptized
and
unrepentant
lest
that
heart
should
be
broken
and
her
prayers
unanswered
he
recovered
and
began
to
teach
already
while
he
was
in
carthage
he
had
suspected
that
the
lives
of
the
manicheans
were
not
much
better
than
those
of
the
heathens
among
whom
they
lived
although
they
gave
out
that
their
creed
was
the
only
one
likely
to
reform
human
nature
in
rome
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
thinking
that
augustine
was
altogether
one
of
themselves
they
threw
off
the
mask
and
showed
themselves
in
their
true
colours
the
pagans
at
least
were
honest
they
professed
openly
that
they
lived
for
nothing
but
enjoyment
and
in
this
great
city
even
more
than
in
carthage
one
could
learn
how
low
a
man
might
fall
but
at
least
they
were
not
hypocrites
he
resolved
to
cut
himself
adrift
from
the
manicheans
altogether
there
was
a
christian
rome
within
the
pagan
rome
but
of
this
augustine
knew
nothing
on
the
throne
of
the
fisherman
sat
damasus
wise
and
holy
his
secretary
jerome
was
already
famous
no
less
for
his
eloquence
than
for
the
greatness
of
his
character
jerome
like
augustine
had
been
carried
away
in
his
youth
by
the
downward
tide
but
had
retrieved
himself
by
a
glorious
penance
the
descendants
of
the
oldest
roman
families
were
to
be
found
in
the
hospitals
tending
the
sick
or
working
amongst
the
poor
in
the
great
city
the
first
monasteries
were
growing
up
little
centres
of
faith
and
prayer
in
the
desert
they
were
peopled
by
men
and
women
who
had
counted
the
world
well
lost
for
christ
or
by
those
who
to
save
their
souls
had
fled
as
the
great
benedict
was
to
do
later
from
the
corruptions
that
had
dragged
down
so
many
into
the
abyss
augustine
had
been
greatly
attracted
shortly
before
leaving
carthage
by
the
preaching
of
helpidius
a
catholic
priest
the
idea
came
to
him
while
in
rome
to
go
to
the
catholics
and
find
out
what
they
really
taught
but
he
dismissed
it
the
manicheans
had
already
told
him
he
reflected
that
no
intelligent
man
could
accept
their
doctrines
besides
they
were
too
strict
their
ideals
were
too
high
he
would
have
to
give
up
too
much
one
more
honest
impulse
was
stifled
he
entered
a
school
of
philosophers
who
professed
to
believe
in
nothing
it
was
he
decided
the
wisest
philosophy
he
knew
chapter
ix
how
augustine
came
to
milan
and
how
his
soul
found
light
and
peace
at
last
augustine
had
not
been
a
year
in
rome
before
he
discovered
that
the
ways
of
the
roman
students
were
not
quite
so
delightful
as
he
had
been
led
to
believe
they
were
less
insolent
it
is
true
than
those
of
carthage
and
not
so
rough
but
they
had
other
defects
which
were
quite
as
trying
they
would
for
instance
attend
the
classes
of
a
certain
professor
until
the
time
arrived
to
pay
their
fees
when
deserting
in
a
body
to
another
school
they
would
proceed
to
play
the
same
trick
there
it
was
certainly
one
way
of
getting
an
education
for
nothing
but
it
was
hard
on
the
teachers
it
seemed
scarcely
the
profession
in
which
one
would
be
likely
to
make
a
fortune
even
if
it
were
possible
to
earn
one
daily
bread
augustine
was
discouraged
and
sick
at
heart
everything
seemed
to
be
against
him
there
was
no
hope
no
light
anywhere
his
life
seemed
doomed
to
be
a
failure
in
spite
of
all
his
gifts
and
then
quite
suddenly
came
the
opening
that
he
had
longed
for
symmachus
the
prefect
of
rome
received
a
letter
from
milan
requesting
him
to
name
a
professor
of
rhetoric
for
the
vacant
chair
in
that
city
a
competition
was
announced
in
which
symmachus
himself
a
orator
was
to
be
the
judge
augustine
entered
and
won
the
prize
it
was
an
excellent
and
honourable
position
the
professor
was
supported
by
the
state
the
emperor
valentinian
held
his
court
in
the
city
which
gave
it
a
certain
position
augustine
was
furnished
with
letters
of
introduction
to
ambrose
the
bishop
who
had
been
brilliantly
successful
at
the
bar
in
his
youth
and
was
probably
an
old
friend
of
symmachus
he
was
of
a
noble
roman
family
and
famous
alike
for
his
great
learning
and
peculiar
charm
of
manner
he
was
famous
also
for
his
holiness
of
life
but
this
was
of
less
interest
to
augustine
it
was
ambrose
the
orator
with
whom
he
desired
to
make
acquaintance
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
in
milan
than
he
presented
himself
before
the
bishop
who
received
him
with
a
cordial
courtesy
that
attracted
augustine
at
once
the
only
way
to
judge
of
his
eloquence
was
to
attend
the
sermons
at
the
cathedral
this
augustine
began
to
do
regularly
he
found
that
ambrose
had
not
been
overpraised
he
listened
to
him
at
first
with
the
pleasure
it
always
gave
him
to
hear
an
eloquent
speaker
then
gradually
with
a
shock
of
surprise
he
began
to
attend
to
what
the
bishop
said
as
well
as
to
his
manner
of
saying
it
ambrose
was
explaining
the
doctrines
of
the
church
he
spoke
very
clearly
and
simply
to
the
intelligence
no
less
than
to
the
heart
for
there
were
many
catechumens
in
his
congregation
as
well
as
pagans
who
were
seeking
for
the
truth
the
manicheans
had
deceived
him
then
thought
augustine
they
had
lied
about
the
church
teaching
or
they
themselves
had
been
ignorant
of
it
and
he
had
let
himself
be
deceived
this
was
altogether
unlike
what
they
had
told
him
it
was
noble
and
sublime
all
that
was
great
and
good
in
him
responded
had
he
found
the
truth
at
last
in
the
meantime
monica
determined
to
rejoin
her
son
arrived
in
milan
the
journey
had
been
long
and
dangerous
they
had
been
assailed
by
terrible
storms
even
the
sailors
had
lost
courage
it
was
she
who
had
comforted
them
in
their
fear
the
storm
will
soon
be
over
she
assured
them
i
know
that
we
shall
reach
our
end
in
safety
she
had
a
strong
conviction
that
she
would
not
die
until
her
prayers
had
won
augustine
back
to
god
the
sailors
took
heart
again
at
her
words
her
calm
eyes
strengthened
them
they
felt
that
this
gentle
woman
knew
things
that
were
hidden
from
them
monica
first
visit
was
to
ambrose
the
two
noble
natures
understood
each
other
at
once
thank
god
for
having
given
you
such
a
mother
said
the
bishop
to
augustine
when
he
met
him
a
few
days
later
she
is
one
in
a
thousand
much
had
happened
since
mother
and
son
had
parted
and
much
had
to
be
told
the
first
thing
that
monica
heard
was
that
augustine
had
left
the
manicheans
at
this
she
rejoiced
greatly
she
was
convinced
she
told
him
that
she
would
see
him
a
catholic
before
she
died
thus
she
spoke
to
me
says
augustine
but
to
thee
o
fountain
of
mercy
she
redoubled
her
prayers
and
her
tears
beseeching
thee
to
hasten
thine
aid
and
dispel
my
darkness
they
went
together
now
to
the
sermons
and
sat
side
by
side
in
the
church
as
in
the
days
of
augustine
childhood
one
by
one
he
laid
aside
the
false
ideas
of
the
truth
that
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
manicheans
it
was
growing
clearer
to
him
every
day
true
there
was
much
that
was
above
his
understanding
above
the
understanding
of
any
human
being
as
ambrose
frankly
acknowledged
but
not
above
their
faith
the
manicheans
had
sneered
at
faith
as
childish
and
credulous
and
yet
thought
augustine
how
many
things
he
believed
that
he
could
have
no
possibility
of
proving
he
believed
for
instance
that
hannibal
had
crossed
the
alps
although
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
time
he
believed
that
athens
existed
although
he
had
never
been
there
as
of
old
a
little
group
of
friends
had
gathered
round
him
at
milan
there
was
alypius
the
most
beloved
of
all
his
associates
who
had
taken
the
place
of
the
dear
dead
friend
of
his
boyhood
there
was
romanianus
who
was
there
on
state
business
and
licentius
his
son
with
trigetius
both
pupils
of
augustine
nebridius
who
had
been
with
him
in
carthage
and
was
like
himself
a
native
of
roman
africa
and
several
new
friends
he
had
made
in
milan
it
was
agreed
amongst
them
that
they
should
set
apart
a
certain
time
every
day
to
seek
for
the
truth
reading
and
discussing
among
themselves
the
scriptures
were
to
form
part
of
the
reading
great
hope
has
dawned
wrote
augustine
the
catholic
faith
teaches
not
what
we
thought
and
vainly
accused
it
of
life
is
vain
death
uncertain
if
it
steals
upon
us
of
a
sudden
in
what
state
shall
we
depart
hence
and
where
shall
we
learn
what
here
we
have
neglected
let
us
not
delay
to
seek
after
god
and
the
blessed
life
there
was
in
milan
a
holy
old
priest
called
simplicianus
greatly
beloved
by
ambrose
for
he
had
been
his
teacher
and
guide
in
early
life
to
him
augustine
resolved
to
go
he
might
be
able
to
help
him
he
told
simplicianus
amongst
other
things
that
he
had
been
reading
a
book
of
philosophy
translated
by
a
roman
called
victorinus
the
book
was
good
said
simplicianus
but
the
story
of
own
life
was
better
he
had
known
him
well
in
rome
augustine
was
interested
he
would
like
to
hear
the
story
he
said
victorinus
said
the
old
man
was
a
pagan
and
a
worshipper
of
the
heathen
gods
he
was
a
famous
orator
and
taught
rhetoric
to
some
of
the
noblest
citizens
of
rome
he
was
learned
in
every
science
and
was
so
celebrated
for
his
virtue
that
a
statue
had
been
erected
to
him
in
the
forum
in
his
old
age
after
earnest
study
he
became
a
christian
but
remained
a
long
time
a
catechumen
through
fears
of
what
his
friends
would
say
at
last
taking
courage
he
prepared
himself
for
baptism
and
to
punish
himself
for
his
human
respect
insisted
on
reading
his
profession
of
faith
aloud
before
the
whole
congregation
instead
of
making
it
as
was
usual
in
private
this
courageous
action
of
an
old
man
made
augustine
feel
his
own
cowardice
he
believed
now
that
the
catholic
church
was
the
true
church
and
yet
he
could
not
face
the
thought
of
baptism
he
would
have
to
give
up
so
much
the
christian
standard
was
high
for
a
man
who
had
spent
his
life
in
he
could
never
attain
to
it
he
took
leave
of
simplicianus
sadly
the
help
which
he
needed
was
not
to
be
found
there
i
went
about
my
usual
business
he
says
while
my
anxiety
increased
as
i
daily
sighed
to
thee
he
frequented
the
church
now
even
when
there
were
no
sermons
for
he
began
to
feel
the
need
of
prayer
one
day
when
alypius
and
he
were
alone
together
there
came
in
a
friend
of
theirs
pontitianus
a
devout
christian
who
held
a
post
at
the
emperor
court
finding
the
epistles
of
paul
upon
the
table
he
smiled
at
augustine
saying
that
he
was
glad
that
he
was
reading
them
for
they
were
full
of
teaching
he
began
to
tell
them
about
anthony
and
of
the
many
hermitages
and
monasteries
in
egypt
and
even
here
in
his
own
country
he
spoke
to
them
of
the
monastic
life
and
its
virtues
and
seeing
their
interest
and
astonishment
went
on
to
tell
them
an
incident
that
had
happened
a
short
time
before
two
young
men
of
the
imperial
court
friends
of
his
own
walking
together
in
the
country
came
to
a
cottage
inhabited
by
some
holy
recluses
a
life
of
anthony
lay
on
the
table
one
of
them
took
it
up
and
began
to
read
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
astonishment
his
second
of
admiration
how
uncertain
life
is
he
said
suddenly
to
his
companion
we
are
in
the
emperor
service
i
wish
we
were
in
god
i
had
rather
be
his
friend
than
the
emperor
he
read
on
with
sighs
and
groans
at
last
he
shut
the
book
and
arose
my
mind
is
made
up
he
said
i
shall
enter
god
service
here
and
now
if
you
will
not
do
so
too
at
least
do
not
try
to
hinder
me
you
have
chosen
well
said
the
other
i
am
with
you
in
this
they
never
left
the
hermitage
this
story
only
increased
augustine
misery
he
had
had
more
graces
than
these
young
men
and
had
wasted
them
he
was
a
coward
when
pontitianus
had
gone
away
he
left
alypius
and
went
out
into
the
garden
alypius
followed
and
sat
down
beside
him
what
are
we
about
cried
augustine
hotly
the
unlearned
take
heaven
by
force
and
we
with
all
our
heartless
learning
wallow
in
the
mire
he
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
the
way
lay
clear
before
him
he
had
found
the
eternal
truth
for
which
he
had
been
seeking
so
long
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
go
further
this
and
that
he
would
have
to
do
this
and
that
he
would
have
to
give
up
he
could
not
it
was
too
hard
and
yet
to
stand
with
both
feet
on
the
rock
of
truth
was
it
not
worth
all
this
and
more
so
the
battle
raged
good
and
evil
struggled
together
in
his
soul
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
he
saw
a
long
procession
winding
across
the
garden
it
passed
him
and
faded
in
the
distance
first
came
boys
and
girls
young
and
weak
scarcely
more
than
children
and
they
mocked
him
gently
we
have
fought
and
conquered
they
said
even
we
after
them
came
a
great
multitude
of
men
and
women
in
the
prime
of
life
some
strong
and
vigorous
some
feeble
and
sickly
it
seemed
to
augustine
as
if
they
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
contempt
we
have
lived
purely
they
said
we
have
striven
and
conquered
they
were
followed
by
old
men
and
women
worn
with
age
and
suffering
they
looked
at
him
reproachfully
we
have
fought
and
conquered
they
said
we
have
endured
unto
the
end
augustine
was
leaving
him
even
alypius
presence
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
leapt
to
his
feet
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
garden
and
throwing
himself
down
on
the
ground
wept
as
if
his
heart
would
break
his
soul
tossed
this
way
and
that
in
its
anguish
cried
desperately
to
god
for
help
suddenly
on
the
stillness
of
the
summer
afternoon
there
broke
the
sound
of
a
child
voice
sweet
insistent
tolle
lege
it
sang
tolle
lege
take
and
read
augustine
stood
up
there
was
no
one
there
no
human
being
was
in
sight
tolle
lege
tolle
lege
rang
the
sweet
voice
again
and
again
in
his
ear
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
was
this
the
answer
to
his
prayer
he
remembered
how
anthony
had
opened
the
sacred
scriptures
on
a
like
occasion
and
had
found
the
help
that
he
required
going
back
to
alypius
he
took
up
the
sacred
volume
and
opened
it
put
ye
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh
and
the
concupiscence
thereof
he
read
light
strength
and
conviction
flowed
into
his
soul
with
god
help
all
things
were
possible
he
would
give
up
all
and
follow
him
then
having
carefully
marked
the
place
he
sat
down
beside
alypius
and
told
him
of
his
resolution
what
about
me
asked
alypius
perhaps
there
is
something
there
for
me
too
let
me
see
he
took
the
book
from
augustine
opened
at
the
place
he
had
marked
and
read
he
that
is
weak
in
the
faith
take
unto
you
that
will
do
very
well
for
me
he
said
augustine
first
thought
was
for
monica
he
must
go
to
her
and
at
once
they
sat
together
hand
in
hand
until
the
sun
sank
in
a
glory
and
the
cool
shadows
of
the
evening
fell
like
a
blessing
on
the
earth
there
are
some
joys
too
deep
for
speech
too
holy
to
be
touched
by
mortal
hands
chapter
x
how
monica
lived
at
cassiacum
with
augustine
and
his
friends
and
how
augustine
was
baptized
by
ambrose
amongst
the
saints
there
are
two
great
penitents
mary
magdalene
and
augustine
who
in
the
first
moment
of
their
conversion
shook
themselves
wholly
free
from
the
trammels
of
the
past
and
never
looked
back
again
thou
hast
broken
my
bonds
in
sunder
cries
augustine
to
thee
will
i
offer
the
sacrifice
of
praise
honours
wealth
pleasure
all
the
things
he
had
desired
so
passionately
were
now
as
nothing
to
him
for
thou
didst
expel
them
from
me
he
says
and
didst
come
in
thyself
instead
of
them
and
i
sang
to
thee
my
lord
god
my
true
honour
my
riches
and
my
salvation
the
vacation
was
close
at
hand
augustine
resolved
to
give
up
his
professorship
and
to
go
away
quietly
to
prepare
himself
for
baptism
verecundus
one
of
the
little
group
of
faithful
friends
who
surrounded
him
had
a
country
house
in
cassiacum
which
he
offered
for
his
use
while
he
remained
in
italy
it
was
a
happy
party
that
gathered
within
its
walls
there
were
augustine
and
his
younger
brother
navigius
the
faithful
alypius
who
was
to
receive
baptism
with
his
friend
licentius
and
trigetius
augustine
two
pupils
and
several
others
lastly
there
was
monica
who
was
a
mother
to
them
all
and
whose
sunny
presence
did
much
to
enliven
the
household
it
was
autumn
an
italian
the
country
was
a
glory
of
green
and
gold
and
crimson
the
apennines
lying
like
purple
shadows
in
the
distance
here
in
the
seclusion
that
was
so
dear
to
his
heart
augustine
read
the
psalms
for
the
first
time
his
soul
was
on
fire
with
their
beauty
every
word
carried
him
to
god
monica
read
with
him
and
he
tells
us
that
he
would
often
turn
to
her
for
an
explanation
for
he
continues
she
was
walking
steadily
in
the
path
in
which
i
was
as
yet
feeling
my
way
there
were
other
studies
besides
to
be
carried
on
and
augustine
tells
us
of
some
of
the
interesting
discussions
that
were
held
on
the
lawn
or
in
the
hall
of
the
baths
which
they
used
when
the
weather
was
not
fine
enough
to
go
out
one
morning
when
he
and
his
pupils
were
talking
of
the
wonderful
harmony
and
order
that
exist
in
nature
the
door
opened
and
monica
looked
in
how
are
you
getting
on
she
asked
for
she
knew
what
they
were
discussing
augustine
invited
her
to
join
them
but
monica
smiled
i
have
never
heard
of
a
woman
amongst
the
philosophers
she
said
that
is
a
mistake
replied
augustine
there
were
women
philosophers
amongst
the
ancients
and
you
know
my
dear
mother
that
i
like
your
philosophy
very
much
philosophy
means
nothing
else
but
love
of
wisdom
now
you
love
wisdom
more
even
than
you
love
me
and
i
know
how
much
that
is
why
you
are
so
far
advanced
in
wisdom
that
you
fear
no
not
even
death
itself
everybody
says
that
this
is
the
very
height
of
philosophy
i
will
therefore
sit
at
your
feet
as
your
disciple
monica
still
smiling
told
her
son
that
he
had
never
told
so
many
lies
in
his
life
in
spite
of
her
protests
however
they
would
not
let
her
go
and
she
was
enrolled
amongst
the
philosophers
the
discussions
says
augustine
owed
a
good
deal
of
their
beauty
to
her
presence
the
of
november
was
augustine
birthday
after
dinner
he
invited
his
friends
to
come
to
the
hall
of
the
baths
that
their
souls
might
be
fed
also
for
i
suppose
you
all
admit
he
said
when
they
had
settled
themselves
for
conversation
that
we
are
made
up
of
soul
and
body
to
this
everybody
agreed
but
navigius
who
was
inclined
to
argue
and
who
said
he
did
not
know
do
you
mean
asked
augustine
that
there
is
nothing
at
all
that
you
do
know
or
that
of
the
few
things
you
do
not
know
this
is
one
navigius
was
a
little
put
out
at
this
question
but
they
pacified
him
and
at
last
persuaded
him
to
say
that
he
was
as
certain
of
the
fact
that
he
was
made
up
of
body
and
soul
as
anybody
could
be
they
then
agreed
that
food
was
taken
for
the
sake
of
the
body
must
not
the
soul
have
its
food
too
asked
augustine
and
what
is
that
food
is
it
not
knowledge
monica
agreed
to
this
but
trigetius
objected
why
you
yourself
said
monica
are
a
living
proof
of
it
did
you
not
tell
us
at
dinner
that
you
did
not
know
what
you
were
eating
because
you
were
lost
in
thought
yet
your
teeth
were
working
all
the
time
where
was
your
soul
at
that
moment
if
not
feeding
too
then
augustine
reminding
them
that
it
was
his
birthday
said
that
as
he
had
already
given
them
a
little
feast
for
the
body
he
would
now
give
them
one
for
the
soul
were
they
hungry
he
asked
there
was
an
eager
chorus
of
assent
can
a
man
be
happy
he
said
if
he
has
not
what
he
wants
and
is
he
happy
if
he
has
it
monica
was
the
first
to
answer
this
question
if
he
wants
what
is
good
and
has
it
she
replied
he
is
happy
but
if
he
wants
what
is
bad
he
is
not
happy
even
if
he
has
it
well
said
mother
cried
augustine
you
have
reached
the
heights
of
philosophy
at
a
single
bound
someone
then
said
that
if
a
man
were
needy
he
could
not
be
happy
finally
they
all
agreed
that
only
he
who
possessed
god
could
be
wholly
happy
but
the
discussion
had
gone
on
for
a
long
time
and
augustine
suggested
that
the
soul
might
have
too
much
nourishment
as
well
as
the
body
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
put
off
the
rest
until
the
discussion
was
continued
next
day
since
only
he
who
possesses
god
can
be
happy
who
is
he
who
possesses
god
asked
augustine
and
they
were
all
invited
to
give
their
opinion
he
that
leads
a
good
life
answered
one
he
who
does
god
will
said
another
he
who
is
pure
of
heart
said
a
third
navigius
would
not
say
anything
but
agreed
with
the
last
speaker
monica
approved
of
them
all
augustine
continued
it
is
god
will
that
all
should
seek
him
of
course
they
all
replied
can
he
who
seeks
god
be
leading
a
bad
life
certainly
not
they
said
can
a
man
who
is
not
pure
in
heart
seek
god
no
they
agreed
then
said
augustine
what
have
we
here
a
man
who
leads
a
good
life
does
god
will
and
is
pure
of
heart
is
seeking
god
but
he
does
not
yet
possess
him
therefore
we
can
not
uphold
that
they
who
lead
good
lives
do
god
will
and
are
pure
of
heart
possess
god
they
all
laughed
at
the
trap
in
which
he
had
caught
them
but
monica
saying
that
she
was
slow
to
grasp
these
things
asked
to
have
the
argument
repeated
then
she
thought
a
moment
no
one
can
possess
god
without
seeking
him
she
said
true
said
augustine
but
while
he
is
seeking
he
does
not
yet
possess
i
think
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
have
god
she
said
but
those
who
live
well
have
him
for
their
friend
and
those
who
live
badly
make
themselves
his
enemies
let
us
change
the
statement
who
possesses
god
is
happy
to
who
has
god
for
his
friend
is
happy
all
agreed
to
this
but
navigius
no
he
said
for
this
reason
if
he
is
happy
who
has
god
for
his
friend
and
god
is
the
friend
of
those
who
seek
him
and
those
who
seek
him
do
not
possess
him
for
to
this
all
have
agreed
then
it
is
obvious
that
those
who
are
seeking
god
have
not
what
they
want
and
we
all
agreed
yesterday
that
a
man
can
not
be
happy
unless
he
has
what
he
wants
monica
could
not
see
her
way
out
of
this
difficulty
although
she
was
sure
there
was
one
i
yield
she
said
for
logic
is
against
me
well
said
augustine
we
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
who
has
found
god
has
him
for
his
friend
and
is
happy
but
he
who
is
still
seeking
god
has
him
for
his
friend
but
is
not
yet
happy
he
however
who
has
separated
himself
from
god
by
sin
has
neither
god
for
his
friend
nor
is
he
happy
this
satisfied
everybody
the
other
side
of
the
question
was
then
considered
in
what
did
unhappiness
consist
asked
augustine
monica
maintained
that
neediness
and
unhappiness
must
go
together
for
he
who
has
not
what
he
wants
she
said
is
both
needy
and
unhappy
augustine
then
supposed
a
man
who
had
everything
he
wanted
in
this
world
could
it
be
said
that
he
was
needy
yet
was
it
certain
that
he
was
happy
licentius
suggested
that
there
would
remain
with
him
the
fear
of
losing
what
he
had
that
fear
replied
augustine
would
make
him
unhappy
but
would
not
make
him
needy
therefore
we
could
have
a
man
who
is
unhappy
without
being
needy
to
this
everyone
agreed
but
monica
who
still
argued
that
unhappiness
could
not
be
separated
from
neediness
this
supposed
man
of
yours
she
said
rich
and
fortunate
still
fears
to
lose
his
good
fortune
that
shows
that
he
wants
wisdom
can
we
call
a
man
who
wants
money
needy
and
not
call
him
so
when
he
wants
wisdom
at
this
remark
there
was
a
general
outcry
of
admiration
it
was
the
very
argument
said
augustine
that
he
had
meant
to
use
himself
nothing
said
licentius
could
have
been
more
truly
and
divinely
said
what
indeed
is
more
wretched
than
to
lack
wisdom
and
the
wise
man
can
never
be
needy
whatever
else
he
lacks
augustine
then
went
on
to
define
wisdom
the
wisdom
that
makes
us
happy
he
said
is
the
wisdom
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
is
the
son
of
god
perfect
life
is
the
only
happy
life
he
continued
and
to
this
by
means
of
firm
faith
cheerful
hope
and
burning
love
we
shall
surely
be
brought
if
we
but
hasten
towards
it
so
the
discussion
ended
and
all
were
content
oh
cried
trigetius
how
i
wish
you
would
provide
us
with
a
feast
like
this
every
day
moderation
in
all
things
answered
augustine
if
this
has
been
a
pleasure
to
you
it
is
god
alone
that
you
must
thank
so
the
happy
innocent
days
flew
past
in
the
pursuit
of
that
wisdom
which
is
eternal
too
late
have
i
loved
thee
o
beauty
ever
ancient
ever
new
cried
augustine
behold
thou
wast
within
me
and
i
was
abroad
and
there
i
sought
thee
i
have
tasted
thee
and
i
am
hungry
after
thee
thou
hast
touched
me
and
i
am
all
on
fire
at
the
beginning
of
lent
augustine
and
alypius
returned
to
milan
to
attend
the
course
of
instructions
which
ambrose
was
to
give
to
those
who
were
preparing
for
baptism
in
the
night
between
holy
saturday
and
easter
sunday
the
stains
of
the
past
were
washed
away
for
ever
in
those
cleansing
waters
and
at
the
mass
of
the
daybreak
on
that
blessed
morning
augustine
knelt
at
the
altar
to
receive
his
lord
monica
was
beside
him
her
tears
and
her
prayers
had
been
answered
she
and
her
son
were
one
again
in
heart
and
soul
chapter
xi
how
monica
set
out
for
africa
with
augustine
and
how
she
died
at
ostia
on
the
tiber
in
the
old
days
at
milan
before
his
conversion
augustine
had
often
told
his
friends
that
the
dream
of
his
life
was
to
live
quietly
somewhere
with
a
few
friends
who
would
devote
themselves
to
the
search
for
truth
it
had
even
been
proposed
to
try
the
scheme
but
it
would
not
work
some
of
his
friends
were
married
others
had
worldly
ties
that
they
could
not
break
the
idea
had
to
be
given
up
now
he
had
found
the
truth
and
at
cassiacum
his
dream
had
been
in
a
manner
realized
why
should
they
not
continue
to
live
like
that
he
asked
alypius
at
all
events
until
they
were
ready
for
the
work
to
which
god
had
called
them
and
where
should
they
live
this
life
but
in
their
own
country
which
was
to
be
the
future
field
of
their
labours
alypius
asked
nothing
better
their
friend
evodius
like
themselves
a
citizen
of
tagaste
who
had
been
baptized
a
short
time
before
was
ready
to
join
them
he
held
a
high
position
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
but
it
seemed
to
him
a
nobler
thing
to
serve
the
king
of
kings
so
these
three
future
bishops
of
the
church
in
africa
made
their
plans
together
monica
would
be
the
mother
of
the
little
household
as
she
had
been
at
cassiacum
she
was
ready
to
go
wherever
they
wished
a
few
days
before
they
started
an
event
occurred
which
they
all
remembered
later
it
was
the
feast
of
cyprian
and
monica
had
returned
from
mass
absorbed
in
god
as
she
always
was
after
holy
communion
perhaps
she
had
been
thinking
of
her
night
of
anguish
in
the
little
chapel
by
the
seashore
at
carthage
three
years
before
when
god
had
seemed
deaf
to
her
prayers
in
order
that
he
might
grant
her
the
fulness
of
her
heart
desire
suddenly
she
turned
to
them
with
shining
eyes
let
us
hasten
to
heaven
she
cried
they
gently
questioned
her
as
to
what
she
meant
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
them
my
soul
and
my
flesh
have
rejoiced
in
the
living
god
she
said
and
they
marvelled
at
the
heavenly
beauty
of
her
face
it
was
a
long
journey
from
milan
to
ostia
on
the
tiber
where
they
were
to
set
sail
for
africa
they
remained
there
for
some
weeks
for
the
ship
was
not
to
start
at
once
one
evening
augustine
and
monica
were
sitting
together
at
a
window
that
overlooked
the
garden
and
the
sea
they
were
talking
of
heaven
augustine
tells
us
asking
each
other
what
that
eternal
life
of
the
saints
must
be
which
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
how
small
in
comparison
were
the
things
of
earth
they
said
even
the
most
beautiful
of
god
creations
for
all
these
things
were
less
than
he
who
made
them
as
their
two
souls
stretched
out
together
towards
the
infinite
love
and
wisdom
it
seemed
to
them
that
for
one
moment
with
one
beat
of
the
heart
they
touched
it
and
the
joy
of
that
moment
was
a
foreshadowing
of
eternity
they
sighed
as
it
faded
from
them
and
they
were
forced
to
return
again
to
the
things
of
earth
son
said
monica
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
now
that
gives
me
any
delight
what
have
i
to
do
here
any
longer
i
know
not
for
all
i
desired
is
granted
there
was
only
one
thing
for
which
i
wished
to
live
and
that
was
to
see
you
a
christian
and
a
catholic
before
i
died
and
god
has
given
me
even
more
than
i
asked
for
he
has
made
you
one
of
his
servants
and
you
now
desire
no
earthly
happiness
what
am
i
doing
here
about
five
days
afterwards
she
fell
ill
of
a
fever
they
thought
she
was
tired
with
the
long
journey
and
would
soon
be
better
but
she
grew
worse
and
was
soon
unconscious
when
she
opened
her
eyes
augustine
and
navigius
were
watching
by
her
bed
you
will
bury
your
mother
here
she
said
augustine
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
but
navigius
who
knew
how
great
had
been
her
desire
to
be
buried
at
tagaste
beside
her
husband
protested
oh
why
are
we
not
at
home
he
cried
where
you
would
wish
to
be
monica
looked
at
him
reproachfully
do
you
hear
what
he
says
she
asked
augustine
lay
my
body
anywhere
she
said
it
does
not
matter
do
not
let
that
disturb
you
this
only
i
ask
that
you
remember
me
at
god
altar
wherever
you
may
be
one
is
never
far
from
god
she
answered
to
another
person
who
asked
her
if
it
would
not
be
sorrow
to
her
to
be
buried
in
a
land
so
far
from
home
it
was
not
only
her
sons
who
grieved
but
the
faithful
friends
who
were
with
them
for
was
she
not
their
mother
too
had
she
not
taken
as
much
care
of
them
as
if
they
had
been
her
children
augustine
scarcely
left
her
side
and
she
was
glad
to
have
him
with
her
as
she
thanked
him
one
day
for
some
little
thing
he
had
done
for
her
his
lip
quivered
she
thought
he
was
thinking
of
all
the
suffering
he
had
caused
her
and
smiled
at
him
with
tender
eyes
you
have
always
been
a
good
son
to
me
she
said
never
have
i
heard
a
harsh
or
reproachful
word
from
your
lips
my
life
was
torn
in
two
says
augustine
that
life
which
was
made
up
of
mine
and
hers
they
were
all
with
her
when
she
passed
peacefully
away
a
few
days
later
they
choked
back
their
tears
it
did
not
seem
meet
says
augustine
to
celebrate
that
death
with
groans
and
lamentations
such
things
were
fit
for
a
less
blessed
deathbed
but
not
for
hers
then
as
they
knelt
gazing
at
the
beloved
face
that
seemed
to
be
smiling
at
some
unseen
mystery
evodius
had
a
happy
inspiration
taking
up
the
psalter
he
opened
it
at
the
psalm
i
will
praise
thee
o
lord
with
my
whole
heart
he
sang
softly
in
the
assembly
of
the
just
and
in
the
congregation
great
are
the
works
of
the
lord
sang
the
others
with
trembling
voices
sought
out
as
they
are
according
unto
all
his
pleasure
friends
and
religious
women
who
had
gathered
near
the
house
to
pray
entered
and
joined
in
the
chant
it
was
the
voice
of
rejoicing
rather
than
the
cry
of
grief
that
followed
that
pure
soul
on
its
way
to
heaven
augustine
alone
was
silent
for
his
heart
was
breaking
we
are
but
human
after
all
and
the
sense
of
their
loss
fell
upon
them
all
later
that
night
augustine
lay
thinking
of
his
life
and
the
unselfish
love
of
which
it
had
been
so
full
thy
handmaid
so
pious
towards
thee
so
careful
and
tender
towards
us
and
i
let
go
my
tears
he
tells
us
and
let
them
flow
as
much
as
they
would
i
wept
for
her
who
for
so
many
years
had
wept
for
me
they
buried
her
as
she
herself
had
foretold
in
ostia
where
her
sacred
relics
were
found
a
thousand
years
later
by
pope
martin
and
carried
to
the
church
of
augustine
in
rome
the
memory
of
the
mother
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
remained
with
augustine
until
the
day
of
his
death
he
loved
to
speak
of
her
thirty
years
later
while
preaching
to
his
people
at
hippo
he
said
the
dead
do
not
come
back
to
us
if
it
were
so
how
often
should
i
see
my
holy
mother
at
my
side
she
followed
me
over
sea
and
land
into
far
countries
that
she
might
not
lose
me
for
ever
god
forbid
that
she
should
be
less
loving
now
that
she
is
more
blessed
ah
no
she
would
come
to
help
and
comfort
me
for
she
loved
me
more
than
i
can
tell
the
dead
do
not
come
back
but
who
that
has
followed
the
career
of
the
great
bishop
and
doctor
of
the
church
can
doubt
that
she
who
prayed
for
him
so
fervently
on
earth
had
ceased
to
pray
for
him
in
heaven
