endymion
a
poetic
romance
by
john
keats
the
stretched
metre
of
an
antique
song
london
printed
for
taylor
and
hessey
fleet
street
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
thomas
chatterton
preface
knowing
within
myself
the
manner
in
which
this
poem
has
been
produced
it
is
not
without
a
feeling
of
regret
that
i
make
it
public
what
manner
i
mean
will
be
quite
clear
to
the
reader
who
must
soon
perceive
great
inexperience
immaturity
and
every
error
denoting
a
feverish
attempt
rather
than
a
deed
accomplished
the
two
first
books
and
indeed
the
two
last
i
feel
sensible
are
not
of
such
completion
as
to
warrant
their
passing
the
press
nor
should
they
if
i
thought
a
year
castigation
would
do
them
any
good
it
will
not
the
foundations
are
too
sandy
it
is
just
that
this
youngster
should
die
away
a
sad
thought
for
me
if
i
had
not
some
hope
that
while
it
is
dwindling
i
may
be
plotting
and
fitting
myself
for
verses
fit
to
live
this
may
be
speaking
too
presumptuously
and
may
deserve
a
punishment
but
no
feeling
man
will
be
forward
to
inflict
it
he
will
leave
me
alone
with
the
conviction
that
there
is
not
a
fiercer
hell
than
the
failure
in
a
great
object
this
is
not
written
with
the
least
atom
of
purpose
to
forestall
criticisms
of
course
but
from
the
desire
i
have
to
conciliate
men
who
are
competent
to
look
and
who
do
look
with
a
zealous
eye
to
the
honour
of
english
literature
the
imagination
of
a
boy
is
healthy
and
the
mature
imagination
of
a
man
is
healthy
but
there
is
a
space
of
life
between
in
which
the
soul
is
in
a
ferment
the
character
undecided
the
way
of
life
uncertain
the
ambition
thence
proceeds
mawkishness
and
all
the
thousand
bitters
which
those
men
i
speak
of
must
necessarily
taste
in
going
over
the
following
pages
i
hope
i
have
not
in
too
late
a
day
touched
the
beautiful
mythology
of
greece
and
dulled
its
brightness
for
i
wish
to
try
once
more
before
i
bid
it
farewel
april
erratum
page
line
from
the
bottom
for
her
read
his
endymion
book
i
a
thing
of
beauty
is
a
joy
for
ever
its
loveliness
increases
it
will
never
pass
into
nothingness
but
still
will
keep
a
bower
quiet
for
us
and
a
sleep
full
of
sweet
dreams
and
health
and
quiet
breathing
therefore
on
every
morrow
are
we
wreathing
a
flowery
band
to
bind
us
to
the
earth
spite
of
despondence
of
the
inhuman
dearth
of
noble
natures
of
the
gloomy
days
of
all
the
unhealthy
and
ways
made
for
our
searching
yes
in
spite
of
all
some
shape
of
beauty
moves
away
the
pall
from
our
dark
spirits
such
the
sun
the
moon
trees
old
and
young
sprouting
a
shady
boon
for
simple
sheep
and
such
are
daffodils
with
the
green
world
they
live
in
and
clear
rills
that
for
themselves
a
cooling
covert
make
the
hot
season
the
mid
forest
brake
rich
with
a
sprinkling
of
fair
blooms
and
such
too
is
the
grandeur
of
the
dooms
we
have
imagined
for
the
mighty
dead
all
lovely
tales
that
we
have
heard
or
read
an
endless
fountain
of
immortal
drink
pouring
unto
us
from
the
heaven
brink
nor
do
we
merely
feel
these
essences
for
one
short
hour
no
even
as
the
trees
that
whisper
round
a
temple
become
soon
dear
as
the
temple
self
so
does
the
moon
the
passion
poesy
glories
infinite
haunt
us
till
they
become
a
cheering
light
unto
our
souls
and
bound
to
us
so
fast
that
whether
there
be
shine
or
gloom
they
alway
must
be
with
us
or
we
die
therefore
is
with
full
happiness
that
i
will
trace
the
story
of
endymion
the
very
music
of
the
name
has
gone
into
my
being
and
each
pleasant
scene
is
growing
fresh
before
me
as
the
green
of
our
own
vallies
so
i
will
begin
now
while
i
can
not
hear
the
city
din
now
while
the
early
budders
are
just
new
and
run
in
mazes
of
the
youngest
hue
about
old
forests
while
the
willow
trails
its
delicate
amber
and
the
dairy
pails
bring
home
increase
of
milk
and
as
the
year
grows
lush
in
juicy
stalks
i
smoothly
steer
my
little
boat
for
many
quiet
hours
with
streams
that
deepen
freshly
into
bowers
many
and
many
a
verse
i
hope
to
write
before
the
daisies
vermeil
rimm
and
white
hide
in
deep
herbage
and
ere
yet
the
bees
hum
about
globes
of
clover
and
sweet
peas
i
must
be
near
the
middle
of
my
story
o
may
no
wintry
season
bare
and
hoary
see
it
half
finished
but
let
autumn
bold
with
universal
tinge
of
sober
gold
be
all
about
me
when
i
make
an
end
and
now
at
once
adventuresome
i
send
my
herald
thought
into
a
wilderness
there
let
its
trumpet
blow
and
quickly
dress
my
uncertain
path
with
green
that
i
may
speed
easily
onward
thorough
flowers
and
weed
upon
the
sides
of
latmos
was
outspread
a
mighty
forest
for
the
moist
earth
fed
so
plenteously
all
roots
into
boughs
and
precious
fruits
and
it
had
gloomy
shades
sequestered
deep
where
no
man
went
and
if
from
shepherd
keep
a
lamb
strayed
far
those
inmost
glens
never
again
saw
he
the
happy
pens
whither
his
brethren
bleating
with
content
over
the
hills
at
every
nightfall
went
among
the
shepherds
was
believed
ever
that
not
one
fleecy
lamb
which
thus
did
sever
from
the
white
flock
but
pass
unworried
by
angry
wolf
or
pard
with
prying
head
until
it
came
to
some
unfooted
plains
where
fed
the
herds
of
pan
ay
great
his
gains
who
thus
one
lamb
did
lose
paths
there
were
many
winding
through
palmy
fern
and
rushes
fenny
and
ivy
banks
all
leading
pleasantly
to
a
wide
lawn
whence
one
could
only
see
stems
thronging
all
around
between
the
swell
of
turf
and
slanting
branches
who
could
tell
the
freshness
of
the
space
of
heaven
above
edg
round
with
dark
tree
tops
through
which
a
dove
would
often
beat
its
wings
and
often
too
a
little
cloud
would
move
across
the
blue
full
in
the
middle
of
this
pleasantness
there
stood
a
marble
altar
with
a
tress
of
flowers
budded
newly
and
the
dew
had
taken
fairy
phantasies
to
strew
daisies
upon
the
sacred
sward
last
eve
and
so
the
dawned
light
in
pomp
receive
for
was
the
morn
apollo
upward
fire
made
every
eastern
cloud
a
silvery
pyre
of
brightness
so
unsullied
that
therein
a
melancholy
spirit
well
might
win
oblivion
and
melt
out
his
essence
fine
into
the
winds
eglantine
gave
temperate
sweets
to
that
sun
the
lark
was
lost
in
him
cold
springs
had
run
to
warm
their
chilliest
bubbles
in
the
grass
man
voice
was
on
the
mountains
and
the
mass
of
nature
lives
and
wonders
puls
tenfold
to
feel
this
and
its
glories
old
now
while
the
silent
workings
of
the
dawn
were
busiest
into
that
lawn
all
suddenly
with
joyful
cries
there
sped
a
troop
of
little
children
garlanded
who
gathering
round
the
altar
seemed
to
pry
earnestly
round
as
wishing
to
espy
some
folk
of
holiday
nor
had
they
waited
for
many
moments
ere
their
ears
were
sated
with
a
faint
breath
of
music
which
then
fill
out
its
voice
and
died
away
again
within
a
little
space
again
it
gave
its
airy
swellings
with
a
gentle
wave
to
leaves
in
smoothest
echoes
breaking
through
vallies
ere
their
death
the
surgy
murmurs
of
the
lonely
sea
and
now
as
deep
into
the
wood
as
we
might
mark
a
lynx
eye
there
glimmered
light
fair
faces
and
a
rush
of
garments
white
plainer
and
plainer
shewing
till
at
last
into
the
widest
alley
they
all
past
making
directly
for
the
woodland
altar
o
kindly
muse
let
not
my
weak
tongue
faulter
in
telling
of
this
goodly
company
of
their
old
piety
and
of
their
glee
but
let
a
portion
of
ethereal
dew
fall
on
my
head
and
presently
unmew
my
soul
that
i
may
dare
in
wayfaring
to
stammer
where
old
chaucer
used
to
sing
leading
the
way
young
damsels
danced
along
bearing
the
burden
of
a
shepherd
song
each
having
a
white
wicker
over
with
april
tender
younglings
next
well
trimm
a
crowd
of
shepherds
with
as
sunburnt
looks
as
may
be
read
of
in
arcadian
books
such
as
sat
listening
round
apollo
pipe
when
the
great
deity
for
earth
too
ripe
let
his
divinity
die
in
music
through
the
vales
of
thessaly
some
idly
trailed
their
on
the
ground
and
some
kept
up
a
shrilly
mellow
sound
with
flutes
close
after
these
now
coming
from
beneath
the
forest
trees
a
venerable
priest
full
soberly
begirt
with
ministring
looks
alway
his
eye
stedfast
upon
the
matted
turf
he
kept
and
after
him
his
sacred
vestments
swept
from
his
right
hand
there
swung
a
vase
of
mingled
wine
generous
light
and
in
his
left
he
held
a
basket
full
of
all
sweet
herbs
that
searching
eye
could
cull
wild
thyme
and
whiter
still
than
leda
love
and
cresses
from
the
rill
his
aged
head
crowned
with
beechen
wreath
seem
like
a
poll
of
ivy
in
the
teeth
of
winter
hoar
then
came
another
crowd
of
shepherds
lifting
in
due
time
aloud
their
share
of
the
ditty
after
them
appear
by
a
multitude
that
their
voices
to
the
clouds
a
fair
wrought
car
easily
rolling
so
as
scarce
to
mar
the
freedom
of
three
steeds
of
dapple
brown
who
stood
therein
did
seem
of
great
renown
among
the
throng
his
youth
was
fully
blown
shewing
like
ganymede
to
manhood
grown
and
for
those
simple
times
his
garments
were
a
chieftain
king
beneath
his
breast
half
bare
was
hung
a
silver
bugle
and
between
his
nervy
knees
there
lay
a
keen
a
smile
was
on
his
countenance
he
seem
to
common
lookers
on
like
one
who
of
idleness
in
groves
elysian
but
there
were
some
who
feelingly
could
scan
a
lurking
trouble
in
his
nether
lip
and
see
that
oftentimes
the
reins
would
slip
through
his
forgotten
hands
then
would
they
sigh
and
think
of
yellow
leaves
of
owlets
cry
of
logs
piled
ah
why
should
our
young
endymion
pine
away
soon
the
assembly
in
a
circle
rang
stood
silent
round
the
shrine
each
look
was
to
sudden
veneration
women
meek
beckon
their
sons
to
silence
while
each
cheek
of
virgin
bloom
paled
gently
for
slight
fear
endymion
too
without
a
forest
peer
stood
wan
and
pale
and
with
an
awed
face
among
his
brothers
of
the
mountain
chase
in
midst
of
all
the
venerable
priest
eyed
them
with
joy
from
greatest
to
the
least
and
after
lifting
up
his
aged
hands
thus
spake
he
men
of
latmos
shepherd
bands
whose
care
it
is
to
guard
a
thousand
flocks
whether
descended
from
beneath
the
rocks
that
overtop
your
mountains
whether
come
from
vallies
where
the
pipe
is
never
dumb
or
from
your
swelling
downs
where
sweet
air
stirs
blue
lightly
and
where
prickly
furze
buds
lavish
gold
or
ye
whose
precious
charge
nibble
their
fill
at
ocean
very
marge
whose
mellow
reeds
are
touch
with
sounds
forlorn
by
the
dim
echoes
of
old
triton
horn
mothers
and
wives
who
day
by
day
prepare
the
scrip
with
needments
for
the
mountain
air
and
all
ye
gentle
girls
who
foster
up
udderless
lambs
and
in
a
little
cup
will
put
choice
honey
for
a
favoured
youth
yea
every
one
attend
for
in
good
truth
our
vows
are
wanting
to
our
great
god
pan
are
not
our
lowing
heifers
sleeker
than
mushrooms
are
not
our
wide
plains
speckled
with
countless
fleeces
have
not
rains
green
over
april
lap
no
howling
sad
sickens
our
fearful
ewes
and
we
have
had
great
bounty
from
endymion
our
lord
the
earth
is
glad
the
merry
lark
has
pour
his
early
song
against
yon
breezy
sky
that
spreads
so
clear
our
solemnity
thus
ending
on
the
shrine
he
heap
a
spire
of
teeming
sweets
enkindling
sacred
fire
anon
he
stain
the
thick
and
spongy
sod
with
wine
in
honour
of
the
now
while
the
earth
was
drinking
it
and
while
bay
leaves
were
crackling
in
the
fragrant
pile
and
gummy
frankincense
was
sparkling
bright
smothering
parsley
and
a
hazy
light
spread
greyly
eastward
thus
a
chorus
sang
o
thou
whose
mighty
palace
roof
doth
hang
from
jagged
trunks
and
overshadoweth
eternal
whispers
glooms
the
birth
life
death
of
unseen
flowers
in
heavy
peacefulness
who
to
see
the
hamadryads
dress
their
ruffled
locks
where
meeting
hazels
darken
and
through
whole
solemn
hours
dost
sit
and
hearken
the
dreary
melody
of
bedded
reeds
in
desolate
places
where
dank
moisture
breeds
the
pipy
hemlock
to
strange
overgrowth
bethinking
thee
how
melancholy
loth
thou
wast
to
lose
fair
syrinx
do
thou
now
by
thy
love
milky
brow
by
all
the
trembling
mazes
that
she
ran
hear
us
great
pan
o
thou
for
whose
quiet
turtles
passion
their
voices
cooingly
myrtles
what
time
thou
wanderest
at
eventide
through
sunny
meadows
that
outskirt
the
side
of
thine
enmossed
realms
o
thou
to
whom
broad
leaved
fig
trees
even
now
foredoom
their
ripen
fruitage
yellow
girted
bees
their
golden
honeycombs
our
village
leas
their
fairest
blossom
beans
and
poppied
corn
the
chuckling
linnet
its
five
young
unborn

sing
for
thee
low
creeping
strawberries
their
summer
coolness
pent
up

their
freckled
wings

the
fresh
budding
year
all
its
completions

quickly
near
by
every
wind

nods
the
mountain

o
forester

thou
to
whom
every
fawn

flies
for
willing
service
whether
to

squatted
hare

half
sleeping

ragged
precipices
flit
to

mysterious
enticement

bewildered
shepherds
to
their
path
again

to
tread
breathless
round
the
frothy
main
and
gather
up
all
fancifullest
shells
for
thee
to
tumble
into
naiads
cells

being
hidden

at

fantastic
leaping

while

mysterious
doors

vows

their
brows

solitary
thinkings
such
as

the
very
bourne
of
heaven

leaven

spreading
in

clodded
earth

it

new

still
a
symbol
of
immensity
a
firmament
reflected
in
a
sea

element

the
space
between
an
unknown
but
no
more

humbly
screen
with
uplift
hands
our
foreheads
lowly
bending
and
giving
out
a
shout

heaven

thee
to
receive
our
humble
pæan
upon
thy
mount
lycean
even
while
they
brought
the
burden
to
a
close
a
shout
from
the
whole
multitude
arose
that
lingered
in
the
air
like
dying
rolls
of
abrupt
thunder
when
ionian
shoals
of
dolphins
bob
their
noses
through
the
brine

on
shady
levels
mossy

young
companies
nimbly
began
dancing
to
the
swift
treble
pipe

those
fair

forms

genitors
unconscious
did
they
cull
time
sweet
they
danc
to
weariness
and
then
in
quiet
circles
did
they
press
the
hillock
turf
and
caught
the
latter
end
of
some
strange
history
potent
to
send
a
young
mind
from
its
bodily
tenement
or
they
might
watch
the
intent
on
either
side
pitying
the
sad
death
of
hyacinthus
when
the
cruel
breath
of
zephyr
slew
him
zephyr
penitent
who
now
ere
phœbus
mounts
the
firmament
fondles
the
flower
amid
the
sobbing
rain
the
archers
too
upon
a
wider
plain
beside
the
feathery
whizzing
of
the
shaft
and
the
dull
twanging
bowstring
and
the
raft
branch
down
sweeping
from
a
tall
ash
top
call
up
a
thousand
thoughts
to
envelope
those
who
would
watch
perhaps
the
trembling
knee
and
frantic
gape
of
lonely
niobe
poor
lonely
niobe
when
her
lovely
young
were
dead
and
gone
and
her
caressing
tongue
lay
a
lost
thing
upon
her
paly
lip
and
very
very
deadliness
did
nip
her
motherly
cheeks
arous
from
this
sad
mood
by
one
who
at
a
distance
loud
halloo
uplifting
his
strong
bow
into
the
air
many
might
after
brighter
visions
stare
after
the
argonauts
in
blind
amaze
tossing
about
on
neptune
restless
ways
until
from
the
horizon
vaulted
side
there
shot
a
golden
splendour
far
and
wide
spangling
those
million
poutings
of
the
brine
with
quivering
ore
was
even
an
awful
shine
from
the
exaltation
of
apollo
bow
a
heavenly
beacon
in
their
dreary
woe
who
thus
were
ripe
for
high
contemplating
might
turn
their
steps
towards
the
sober
ring
where
sat
endymion
and
the
aged
priest
shepherds
gone
in
eld
whose
looks
the
silvery
setting
of
their
mortal
star
there
they
discours
upon
the
fragile
bar
that
keeps
us
from
our
homes
ethereal
and
what
our
duties
there
to
nightly
call
vesper
the
of
summer
weather
to
summon
all
the
downiest
clouds
together
for
the
sun
purple
couch
to
emulate
in
ministring
the
potent
rule
of
fate
with
speed
of
exhalations
to
tint
her
pallid
cheek
with
bloom
who
cons
sweet
poesy
by
moonlight
besides
these
a
world
of
other
unguess
offices
anon
they
wander
by
divine
converse
into
elysium
vieing
to
rehearse
each
one
his
own
anticipated
bliss
one
felt
that
he
could
not
miss
his
quick
gone
love
among
fair
blossom
boughs
where
every
pouts
and
endows
her
lips
with
music
for
the
welcoming
another
wish
mid
that
eternal
spring
to
meet
his
rosy
child
with
feathery
sails
sweeping
through
almond
vales
who
suddenly
should
stoop
through
the
smooth
wind
and
with
the
balmiest
leaves
his
temples
bind
and
ever
after
through
those
regions
be
his
messenger
his
little
mercury
some
were
athirst
in
soul
to
see
again
their
fellow
huntsmen
the
wide
champaign
in
times
long
past
to
sit
with
them
and
talk
of
all
the
chances
in
their
earthly
walk
comparing
joyfully
their
plenteous
stores
of
happiness
to
when
upon
the
moors
benighted
close
they
huddled
from
the
cold
and
shar
their
famish
scrips
thus
all
their
fond
imaginations
saving
him
whose
eyelids
curtain
up
their
jewels
dim
endymion
yet
hourly
had
he
striven
to
hide
the
cankering
venom
that
had
riven
his
fainting
recollections
now
indeed
his
senses
had
swoon
off
he
did
not
heed
the
sudden
silence
or
the
whispers
low
or
the
old
eyes
dissolving
at
his
woe
or
anxious
calls
or
close
of
trembling
palms
or
maiden
sigh
that
grief
itself
embalms
but
in
the
fixed
trance
he
kept
like
one
who
on
the
earth
had
never
slept
aye
even
as
as
a
marble
man
frozen
in
that
old
tale
arabian
who
whispers
him
so
pantingly
and
close
peona
his
sweet
sister
of
all
those
his
friends
the
dearest
hushing
signs
she
made
and
breath
a
sister
sorrow
to
persuade
a
yielding
up
a
cradling
on
her
care
her
eloquence
did
breathe
away
the
curse
she
led
him
like
some
midnight
spirit
nurse
of
happy
changes
in
emphatic
dreams
along
a
path
between
two
little
streams
guarding
his
forehead
with
her
round
elbow
from
branches
and
his
footsteps
slow
from
stumbling
over
stumps
and
hillocks
small
until
they
came
to
where
these
streamlets
fall
with
mingled
bubblings
and
a
gentle
rush
into
a
river
clear
brimful
and
flush
with
crystal
mocking
of
the
trees
and
sky
a
little
shallop
floating
there
hard
by
pointed
its
beak
over
the
fringed
bank
and
soon
it
lightly
dipt
and
rose
and
sank
and
dipt
again
with
the
young
couple
weight
peona
guiding
through
the
water
straight
towards
a
bowery
island
opposite
which
gaining
presently
she
steered
light
into
a
shady
fresh
and
ripply
cove
where
nested
was
an
arbour
overwove
by
many
a
summer
silent
fingering
to
whose
cool
bosom
she
was
used
to
bring
her
playmates
with
their
needle
broidery
and
minstrel
memories
of
times
gone
by
so
she
was
gently
glad
to
see
him
laid
under
her
favourite
bower
quiet
shade
on
her
own
couch
new
made
of
flower
leaves
dried
carefully
on
the
cooler
side
of
sheaves
when
last
the
sun
his
autumn
tresses
shook
and
the
tann
harvesters
rich
armfuls
took
soon
was
he
quieted
to
slumbrous
rest
but
ere
it
crept
upon
him
he
had
prest
peona
busy
hand
against
his
lips
and
still
a
sleeping
held
her
in
tender
pressure
and
as
a
willow
keeps
a
patient
watch
over
the
stream
that
creeps
windingly
by
it
so
the
quiet
maid
held
her
in
peace
so
that
a
whispering
blade
of
grass
a
wailful
gnat
a
bee
bustling
down
in
the
or
a
wren
light
rustling
among
sere
leaves
and
twigs
might
all
be
heard
o
magic
sleep
o
comfortable
bird
that
broodest
the
troubled
sea
of
the
mind
till
it
is
hush
and
smooth
o
restraint
imprisoned
liberty
great
key
to
golden
palaces
strange
minstrelsy
fountains
grotesque
new
trees
bespangled
caves
echoing
grottos
full
of
tumbling
waves
and
moonlight
aye
to
all
the
mazy
world
of
silvery
enchantment
who
beneath
thy
drowsy
wing
a
triple
hour
but
renovates
and
lives
thus
in
the
bower
endymion
was
calm
to
life
again
opening
his
eyelids
with
a
healthier
brain
he
said
i
feel
this
thine
endearing
love
all
through
my
bosom
thou
art
as
a
dove
trembling
its
closed
eyes
and
sleeked
wings
about
me
and
the
pearliest
dew
not
brings
such
morning
incense
from
the
fields
of
may
as
do
those
brighter
drops
that
twinkling
stray
from
those
kind
eyes
the
very
home
and
haunt
of
sisterly
affection
can
i
want
aught
else
aught
nearer
heaven
than
such
tears
yet
dry
them
up
in
bidding
hence
all
fears
that
any
longer
i
will
pass
my
days
alone
and
sad
no
i
will
once
more
raise
my
voice
upon
the
once
more
make
my
horn
parley
from
their
foreheads
hoar
again
my
trooping
hounds
their
tongues
shall
loll
around
the
breathed
boar
again
i
poll
the
yew
tree
for
a
chosen
bow
and
when
the
pleasant
sun
is
getting
low
again
i
linger
in
a
sloping
mead
to
hear
the
speckled
thrushes
and
see
feed
our
idle
sheep
so
be
thou
cheered
sweet
and
if
thy
lute
is
here
softly
intreat
my
soul
to
keep
in
its
resolved
course
hereat
peona
in
their
silver
source
shut
her
pure
sorrow
drops
with
glad
exclaim
and
took
a
lute
from
which
there
pulsing
came
a
lively
prelude
fashioning
the
way
in
which
her
voice
should
wander
was
a
lay
more
subtle
cadenced
more
forest
wild
than
dryope
lone
lulling
of
her
child
and
nothing
since
has
floated
in
the
air
so
mournful
strange
surely
some
influence
rare
went
spiritual
through
the
damsel
hand
for
still
with
delphic
emphasis
she
the
quick
invisible
strings
even
though
she
saw
endymion
spirit
melt
away
and
thaw
before
the
deep
intoxication
but
soon
she
came
with
sudden
burst
upon
her
swung
the
lute
aside
and
earnestly
said
brother
is
vain
to
hide
that
thou
dost
know
of
things
mysterious
immortal
starry
such
alone
could
thus
weigh
down
thy
nature
hast
thou
sinn
in
aught
offensive
to
the
heavenly
powers
caught
a
paphian
dove
upon
a
message
sent
thy
deathful
bow
against
some
bent
sacred
to
dian
haply
thou
hast
seen
her
naked
limbs
among
the
alders
green
and
that
alas
is
death
no
i
can
trace
something
more
high
perplexing
in
thy
face
endymion
look
at
her
and
press
her
hand
and
said
art
thou
so
pale
who
wast
so
bland
and
merry
in
our
meadows
how
is
this
tell
me
thine
ailment
tell
me
all
amiss
ah
thou
hast
been
unhappy
at
the
change
wrought
suddenly
in
me
what
indeed
more
strange
or
more
complete
to
overwhelm
surmise
ambition
is
no
sluggard
is
no
prize
that
toiling
years
would
put
within
my
grasp
that
i
have
sigh
for
with
so
deadly
gasp
no
man
panted
for
a
mortal
love
so
all
have
set
my
heavier
grief
above
these
things
which
happen
rightly
have
they
done
i
who
still
saw
the
horizontal
sun
heave
his
broad
shoulder
the
edge
of
the
world
lucifer
and
then
had
my
spear
aloft
as
signal
for
the
chace
i
who
for
very
sport
of
heart
would
race
with
my
own
steed
from
araby
pluck
down
a
vulture
from
his
towery
perching
frown
a
lion
into
growling
loth
retire
to
lose
at
once
all
my
toil
breeding
fire
and
sink
thus
low
but
i
will
ease
my
breast
of
secret
grief
here
in
this
bowery
nest
this
river
does
not
see
the
naked
sky
till
it
begins
to
progress
silverly
around
the
western
border
of
the
wood
whence
from
a
certain
spot
its
winding
flood
seems
at
the
distance
like
a
crescent
moon
and
in
that
nook
the
very
pride
of
june
had
i
been
used
to
pass
my
weary
eves
the
rather
for
the
sun
unwilling
leaves
so
dear
a
picture
of
his
sovereign
power
and
i
could
witness
his
most
kingly
hour
when
he
doth
lighten
up
the
golden
reins
and
paces
leisurely
down
amber
plains
his
snorting
four
now
when
his
chariot
last
its
beams
against
the
cast
there
blossom
suddenly
a
magic
bed
of
sacred
ditamy
and
poppies
red
at
which
i
wondered
greatly
knowing
well
that
but
one
night
had
wrought
this
flowery
spell
and
sitting
down
close
by
began
to
muse
what
it
might
mean
perhaps
thought
i
morpheus
in
passing
here
his
owlet
pinions
shook
or
it
may
be
ere
matron
night
uptook
her
ebon
urn
young
mercury
by
stealth
had
dipt
his
rod
in
it
such
garland
wealth
came
not
by
common
growth
thus
on
i
thought
until
my
head
was
dizzy
and
distraught
moreover
through
the
dancing
poppies
stole
a
breeze
most
softly
lulling
to
my
soul
and
shaping
visions
all
about
my
sight
of
colours
wings
and
bursts
of
spangly
light
the
which
became
more
strange
and
strange
and
dim
and
then
were
gulph
in
a
tumultuous
swim
and
then
i
fell
asleep
ah
can
i
tell
the
enchantment
that
afterwards
befel
yet
it
was
but
a
dream
yet
such
a
dream
that
never
tongue
although
it
overteem
with
mellow
utterance
like
a
cavern
spring
could
figure
out
and
to
conception
bring
all
i
beheld
and
felt
methought
i
lay
watching
the
zenith
where
the
milky
way
among
the
stars
in
virgin
splendour
pours
and
travelling
my
eye
until
the
doors
of
heaven
appear
to
open
for
my
flight
i
became
loth
and
fearful
to
alight
from
such
high
soaring
by
a
downward
glance
so
kept
me
stedfast
in
that
airy
trance
spreading
imaginary
pinions
wide
when
presently
the
stars
began
to
glide
and
faint
away
before
my
eager
view
at
which
i
sigh
that
i
could
not
pursue
and
dropt
my
vision
to
the
horizon
verge
and
lo
from
opening
clouds
i
saw
emerge
the
loveliest
moon
that
ever
silver
a
shell
for
neptune
goblet
she
did
soar
so
passionately
bright
my
dazzled
soul
commingling
with
her
argent
spheres
did
roll
through
clear
and
cloudy
even
when
she
went
at
last
into
a
dark
and
vapoury
tent
whereat
methought
the
train
of
planets
all
were
in
the
blue
again
to
commune
with
those
orbs
once
more
i
rais
my
sight
right
upward
but
it
was
quite
dazed
by
a
bright
something
sailing
down
apace
making
me
quickly
veil
my
eyes
and
face
again
i
look
and
o
ye
deities
who
from
olympus
watch
our
destinies
whence
that
completed
form
of
all
completeness
whence
came
that
high
perfection
of
all
sweetness
speak
stubborn
earth
and
tell
me
where
o
where
hast
thou
a
symbol
of
her
golden
hair
not
drooping
in
the
western
sun
not
thy
soft
hand
fair
sister
let
me
shun
such
follying
before
thee
yet
she
had
indeed
locks
bright
enough
to
make
me
mad
and
they
were
simply
gordian
up
and
braided
leaving
in
naked
comeliness
unshaded
her
pearl
round
ears
white
neck
and
orbed
brow
the
which
were
blended
in
i
know
not
how
with
such
a
paradise
of
lips
and
eyes
cheeks
half
smiles
and
faintest
sighs
that
when
i
think
thereon
my
spirit
clings
and
plays
about
its
fancy
till
the
stings
of
human
neighbourhood
envenom
all
unto
what
awful
power
shall
i
call
to
what
high
fane
ah
see
her
hovering
feet
more
bluely
vein
more
soft
more
whitely
sweet
than
those
of
venus
when
she
rose
from
out
her
cradle
shell
the
wind
her
scarf
into
a
fluttering
pavilion
is
blue
and
with
a
million
of
little
eyes
as
though
thou
wert
to
shed
over
the
darkest
lushest
bed
handfuls
of
daisies
endymion
how
strange
dream
within
dream
she
took
an
airy
range
and
then
towards
me
like
a
very
maid
came
blushing
waning
willing
and
afraid
and
press
me
by
the
hand
ah
was
too
much
methought
i
fainted
at
the
charmed
touch
yet
held
my
recollection
even
as
one
who
dives
three
fathoms
where
the
waters
run
gurgling
in
beds
of
coral
for
anon
i
felt
upmounted
in
that
region
where
falling
stars
dart
their
artillery
forth
and
eagles
struggle
with
the
buffeting
north
that
balances
the
heavy
felt
too
i
was
not
fearful
nor
alone
but
lapp
and
lull
along
the
dangerous
sky
soon
as
it
seem
we
left
our
journeying
high
and
straightway
into
frightful
eddies
swoop
such
as
ay
muster
where
grey
time
has
huge
dens
and
caverns
in
a
mountain
side
there
hollow
sounds
arous
me
and
i
to
faint
once
more
by
looking
on
my
bliss
i
was
distracted
madly
did
i
kiss
the
wooing
arms
which
held
me
and
did
give
my
eyes
at
once
to
death
but
was
to
live
to
take
in
draughts
of
life
from
the
gold
fount
of
kind
and
passionate
looks
to
count
and
count
the
moments
by
some
greedy
help
that
a
second
self
that
each
might
be
and
plunder
of
its
load
of
blessedness
ah
desperate
mortal
i
dar
to
press
her
very
cheek
against
my
crowned
lip
and
at
that
moment
felt
my
body
dip
into
a
warmer
air
a
moment
more
our
feet
were
soft
in
flowers
there
was
store
of
newest
joys
upon
that
alp
sometimes
a
scent
of
violets
and
blossoming
limes
loiter
around
us
then
of
honey
cells
made
delicate
from
all
bells
and
once
above
the
edges
of
our
nest
an
arch
face
peep
an
oread
as
i
guess
why
did
i
dream
that
sleep
me
in
midst
of
all
this
heaven
why
not
see
far
off
the
shadows
of
his
pinions
dark
and
stare
them
from
me
but
no
like
a
spark
that
needs
must
die
although
its
little
beam
reflects
upon
a
diamond
my
sweet
dream
fell
into
nothing
into
stupid
sleep
and
so
it
was
until
a
gentle
creep
a
careful
moving
caught
my
waking
ears
and
up
i
started
ah
my
sighs
my
tears
my
clenched
hands
for
lo
the
poppies
hung
on
their
stalks
the
ouzel
sung
a
heavy
ditty
and
the
sullen
day
had
chidden
herald
hesperus
away
with
leaden
looks
the
solitary
breeze
bluster
and
slept
and
its
wild
self
did
teaze
with
wayward
melancholy
and
i
thought
mark
me
peona
that
sometimes
it
brought
faint
and
adieus
away
i
wander
all
the
pleasant
hues
of
heaven
and
earth
had
faded
deepest
shades
were
deepest
dungeons
heaths
and
sunny
glades
were
full
of
pestilent
light
our
taintless
rills
seem
sooty
and
with
upturn
gills
of
dying
fish
the
vermeil
rose
had
blown
in
frightful
scarlet
and
its
thorns
like
spiked
aloe
if
an
innocent
bird
before
my
heedless
footsteps
stirr
and
in
little
journeys
i
beheld
in
it
a
disguis
demon
missioned
to
knit
my
soul
with
under
darkness
to
entice
my
stumblings
down
some
monstrous
precipice
therefore
i
eager
followed
and
did
curse
the
disappointment
time
that
aged
nurse
rock
me
to
patience
now
thank
gentle
heaven
these
things
with
all
their
comfortings
are
given
to
my
hours
and
with
thee
sweet
sister
help
to
stem
the
ebbing
sea
of
weary
life
thus
ended
he
and
both
sat
silent
for
the
maid
was
very
loth
to
answer
feeling
well
that
breathed
words
would
all
be
lost
unheard
and
vain
as
swords
against
the
enchased
crocodile
or
leaps
of
grasshoppers
against
the
sun
she
weeps
and
wonders
struggles
to
devise
some
blame
to
put
on
such
a
look
as
would
say
on
this
poor
weakness
but
for
all
her
strife
she
could
as
soon
have
crush
away
the
life
from
a
sick
dove
at
length
to
break
the
pause
she
said
with
trembling
chance
is
this
the
cause
this
all
yet
it
is
strange
and
sad
alas
that
one
who
through
this
middle
earth
should
pass
most
like
a
sojourning
and
leave
his
name
upon
the
should
achieve
no
higher
bard
than
simple
maidenhood
singing
alone
and
fearfully
how
the
blood
left
his
young
cheek
and
how
he
used
to
stray
he
knew
not
where
and
how
he
would
say
if
any
said
was
love
and
yet
was
love
what
could
it
be
but
love
how
a
let
fall
a
sprig
of
yew
tree
in
his
path
and
how
he
died
and
then
that
love
doth
scathe
the
gentle
heart
as
northern
blasts
do
roses
and
then
the
ballad
of
his
sad
life
closes
with
sighs
and
an
alas
endymion
be
rather
in
the
trumpet
mouth
anon
among
the
winds
at
large
that
all
may
hearken
although
before
the
crystal
heavens
darken
i
watch
and
dote
upon
the
silver
lakes
pictur
in
western
cloudiness
that
takes
the
semblance
of
gold
rocks
and
bright
gold
sands
islands
and
creeks
and
strands
with
horses
prancing
them
palaces
and
towers
of
amethyst
would
i
so
tease
my
pleasant
days
because
i
could
not
mount
into
those
regions
the
morphean
fount
of
that
fine
element
that
visions
dreams
and
fitful
whims
of
sleep
are
made
of
streams
into
its
airy
channels
with
so
subtle
so
thin
a
breathing
not
the
spider
shuttle
circled
a
million
times
within
the
space
of
a
swallow
could
delay
a
trace
a
tinting
of
its
quality
how
light
must
dreams
themselves
be
seeing
they
more
slight
than
the
mere
nothing
that
engenders
them
then
wherefore
sully
the
entrusted
gem
of
high
and
noble
life
with
thoughts
so
sick
why
pierce
honour
to
the
quick
for
nothing
but
a
dream
hereat
the
youth
look
up
a
conflicting
of
shame
and
ruth
was
in
his
plaited
brow
yet
his
eyelids
widened
a
little
as
when
zephyr
bids
a
little
breeze
to
creep
between
the
fans
of
careless
butterflies
amid
his
pains
he
seem
to
taste
a
drop
of
full
palatable
and
a
colour
grew
upon
his
cheek
while
thus
he
lifeful
spake
peona
ever
have
i
long
to
slake
my
thirst
for
the
world
praises
nothing
base
no
merely
slumberous
phantasm
could
unlace
the
stubborn
canvas
for
my
voyage
prepar
though
now
is
tatter
leaving
my
bark
and
sullenly
drifting
yet
my
higher
hope
is
of
too
wide
too
a
scope
to
fret
at
myriads
of
earthly
wrecks
wherein
lies
happiness
in
that
which
becks
our
ready
minds
to
fellowship
divine
a
fellowship
with
essence
till
we
shine
full
alchemiz
and
free
of
space
behold
the
clear
religion
of
heaven
fold
a
rose
leaf
round
thy
finger
taperness
and
soothe
thy
lips
hist
when
the
airy
stress
of
music
kiss
impregnates
the
free
winds
and
with
a
sympathetic
touch
unbinds
eolian
magic
from
their
lucid
wombs
then
old
songs
waken
from
enclouded
tombs
old
ditties
sigh
above
their
father
grave
ghosts
of
melodious
prophecyings
rave
round
every
spot
were
trod
apollo
foot
bronze
clarions
awake
and
faintly
bruit
where
long
ago
a
giant
battle
was
and
from
the
turf
a
lullaby
doth
pass
in
every
place
where
infant
orpheus
slept
feel
we
these
things
that
moment
have
we
stept
into
a
sort
of
oneness
and
our
state
is
like
a
floating
spirit
but
there
are
richer
entanglements
enthralments
far
more
leading
by
degrees
to
the
chief
intensity
the
crown
of
these
is
made
of
love
and
friendship
and
sits
high
upon
the
forehead
of
humanity
all
its
more
ponderous
and
bulky
worth
is
friendship
whence
there
ever
issues
forth
a
steady
splendour
but
at
the
there
hangs
by
unseen
film
an
orbed
drop
of
light
and
that
is
love
its
influence
thrown
in
our
eyes
genders
a
novel
sense
at
which
we
start
and
fret
till
in
the
end
melting
into
its
radiance
we
blend
mingle
and
so
become
a
part
of
it
nor
with
aught
else
can
our
souls
interknit
so
wingedly
when
we
combine
therewith
life
self
is
nourish
by
its
proper
pith
and
we
are
nurtured
like
a
pelican
brood
aye
so
delicious
is
the
unsating
food
that
men
who
might
have
tower
in
the
van
of
all
the
congregated
world
to
fan
and
winnow
from
the
coming
step
of
time
all
chaff
of
custom
wipe
away
all
slime
left
by
and
human
serpentry
have
been
content
to
let
occasion
die
whilst
they
did
sleep
in
love
elysium
and
truly
i
would
rather
be
struck
dumb
than
speak
against
this
ardent
listlessness
for
i
have
ever
thought
that
it
might
bless
the
world
with
benefits
unknowingly
as
does
the
nightingale
upperched
high
and
cloister
among
cool
and
bunched
leaves
she
sings
but
to
her
love
nor
conceives
how
tiptoe
night
holds
back
her
hood
just
so
may
love
although
is
understood
the
mere
commingling
of
passionate
breath
produce
more
than
our
searching
witnesseth
what
i
know
not
but
who
of
men
can
tell
that
flowers
would
bloom
or
that
green
fruit
would
swell
to
melting
pulp
that
fish
would
have
bright
mail
the
earth
its
dower
of
river
wood
and
vale
the
meadows
runnels
runnels
the
seed
its
harvest
or
the
lute
its
tones
tones
ravishment
or
ravishment
its
sweet
if
human
souls
did
never
kiss
and
greet
now
if
this
earthly
love
has
power
to
make
men
being
mortal
immortal
to
shake
ambition
from
their
memories
and
brim
their
measure
of
content
what
merest
whim
seems
all
this
poor
endeavour
after
fame
to
one
who
keeps
within
his
stedfast
aim
a
love
immortal
an
immortal
too
look
not
so
wilder
for
these
things
are
true
and
never
can
be
born
of
atomies
that
buzz
about
our
slumbers
like
leaving
us
no
no
i
sure
my
restless
spirit
never
could
endure
to
brood
so
long
upon
one
luxury
unless
it
did
though
fearfully
espy
a
hope
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
dream
my
sayings
will
the
less
obscured
seem
when
i
have
told
thee
how
my
waking
sight
has
made
me
scruple
whether
that
same
night
was
pass
in
dreaming
hearken
sweet
peona
beyond
the
of
latona
which
we
should
see
but
for
these
darkening
boughs
lies
a
deep
hollow
from
whose
ragged
brows
bushes
and
trees
do
lean
all
round
athwart
and
meet
so
nearly
that
with
wings
outraught
and
spreaded
tail
a
vulture
could
not
glide
past
them
but
he
must
brush
on
every
side
some
moulder
steps
lead
into
this
cool
cell
far
as
the
slabbed
margin
of
a
well
whose
patient
level
peeps
its
crystal
eye
right
upward
through
the
bushes
to
the
sky
oft
have
i
brought
thee
flowers
on
their
stalks
set
like
vestal
primroses
but
dark
velvet
edges
them
round
and
they
have
golden
pits
was
there
i
got
them
from
the
gaps
and
slits
in
a
mossy
stone
that
sometimes
was
my
seat
when
all
above
was
faint
with
heat
and
there
in
strife
no
burning
thoughts
to
heed
i
bubble
up
the
water
through
a
reed
so
reaching
back
to
make
me
ships
of
moulted
feathers
touchwood
alder
chips
with
leaves
stuck
in
them
and
the
neptune
be
of
their
petty
ocean
oftener
heavily
when
hours
had
left
me
less
a
child
i
sat
contemplating
the
figures
wild
of
clouds
melting
the
mirror
through
upon
a
day
while
thus
i
watch
by
flew
a
cloudy
cupid
with
his
bow
and
quiver
so
plainly
character
no
breeze
would
shiver
the
happy
chance
so
happy
i
was
fain
to
follow
it
upon
the
open
plain
and
therefore
was
just
going
when
behold
a
wonder
fair
as
any
i
have
told
the
same
bright
face
i
tasted
in
my
sleep
smiling
in
the
clear
well
my
heart
did
leap
through
the
cool
it
moved
as
if
to
flee
i
started
up
when
lo
refreshfully
there
came
upon
my
face
in
plenteous
showers
and
dewy
buds
and
leaves
and
flowers
wrapping
all
objects
from
my
smothered
sight
bathing
my
spirit
in
a
new
delight
aye
such
a
breathless
of
bliss
alone
preserved
me
from
the
drear
abyss
of
death
for
the
fair
form
had
gone
again
pleasure
is
oft
a
visitant
but
pain
clings
cruelly
to
us
like
the
gnawing
sloth
on
the
deer
tender
haunches
late
and
loth
is
scar
away
by
slow
returning
pleasure
how
sickening
how
dark
the
dreadful
leisure
of
weary
days
made
deeper
exquisite
by
a
of
unslumbrous
night
like
sorrow
came
upon
me
heavier
still
than
when
i
wander
from
the
poppy
hill
and
a
whole
age
of
lingering
moments
crept
sluggishly
by
ere
more
contentment
swept
away
at
once
the
deadly
yellow
spleen
yes
thrice
have
i
this
fair
enchantment
seen
once
more
been
tortured
with
renewed
life
when
last
the
wintry
gusts
gave
over
strife
with
the
conquering
sun
of
spring
and
left
the
skies
warm
and
serene
but
yet
with
moistened
eyes
in
pity
of
the
shatter
infant
buds
that
time
thou
didst
adorn
with
amber
studs
my
hunting
cap
because
i
laugh
and
smil
chatted
with
thee
and
many
days
all
torment
from
my
breast
was
even
then
straying
about
yet
coop
up
in
the
den
of
helpless
discontent
hurling
my
lance
from
place
to
place
and
following
at
chance
at
last
by
hap
through
some
young
trees
it
struck
and
plashing
among
bedded
pebbles
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
brook
whose
silver
ramble
down
twenty
little
falls
through
reeds
and
bramble
tracing
along
it
brought
me
to
a
cave
whence
it
ran
brightly
forth
and
white
did
lave
the
nether
sides
of
mossy
stones
and
rock
which
it
gurgled
blythe
adieus
to
mock
its
own
sweet
grief
at
parting
overhead
hung
a
lush
scene
of
drooping
weeds
and
spread
thick
as
to
curtain
up
some
home
ah
impious
mortal
whither
do
i
roam
said
i
low
voic
ah
whither
is
the
grot
of
proserpine
when
hell
obscure
and
hot
doth
her
resign
and
where
her
tender
hands
she
dabbles
on
the
cool
and
sluicy
sands
or
is
the
cell
of
echo
where
she
sits
and
babbles
thorough
silence
till
her
wits
are
gone
in
tender
madness
and
anon
faints
into
sleep
with
many
a
dying
tone
of
sadness
o
that
she
would
take
my
vows
and
breathe
them
sighingly
among
the
boughs
to
sue
her
gentle
ears
for
whose
fair
head
daily
i
pluck
sweet
flowerets
from
their
bed
and
weave
them
dyingly
send
round
every
leaf
that
all
those
gentle
lispers
may
sigh
my
love
unto
her
pitying
o
charitable
echo
hear
and
sing
this
ditty
to
her
tell
her
so
i
stay
my
foolish
tongue
and
listening
half
afraid
stood
stupefied
with
my
own
empty
folly
and
blushing
for
the
freaks
of
melancholy
salt
tears
were
coming
when
i
heard
my
name
most
fondly
lipp
and
then
these
accents
came
endymion
the
cave
is
secreter
than
the
isle
of
delos
echo
hence
shall
stir
no
sighs
but
kisses
or
light
noise
of
thy
combing
hand
the
while
it
travelling
cloys
and
trembles
through
my
labyrinthine
hair
at
that
oppress
i
hurried
ah
where
are
those
swift
moments
whither
are
they
fled
i
smile
no
more
peona
nor
will
wed
sorrow
the
way
to
death
but
patiently
bear
up
against
it
so
farewel
sad
sigh
and
come
instead
demurest
meditation
to
occupy
me
wholly
and
to
fashion
my
pilgrimage
for
the
world
dusky
brink
no
more
will
i
count
over
link
by
link
my
chain
of
grief
no
longer
strive
to
find
a
in
mountain
wind
blustering
about
my
ears
aye
thou
shalt
see
dearest
of
sisters
what
my
life
shall
be
what
a
calm
round
of
hours
shall
make
my
days
there
is
a
paly
flame
of
hope
that
plays
i
look
but
yet
i
say
is
naught
and
here
i
bid
it
die
have
not
i
caught
already
a
more
healthy
countenance
by
this
the
sun
is
setting
we
may
chance
meet
some
of
our
with
my
car
this
said
he
rose
like
a
star
through
autumn
mists
and
took
peona
hand
they
stept
into
the
boat
and
launch
from
land
endymion
book
ii
o
sovereign
power
of
love
o
grief
o
balm
all
records
saving
thine
come
cool
and
calm
and
shadowy
through
the
mist
of
passed
years
for
others
good
or
bad
hatred
and
tears
have
become
indolent
but
touching
thine
one
sigh
doth
echo
one
poor
sob
doth
pine
one
kiss
brings
from
buried
days
the
woes
of
troy
towers
smothering
their
blaze
shields
spears
keen
blades
struggling
and
blood
and
shrieks
all
dimly
fades
into
some
backward
corner
of
the
brain
yet
in
our
very
souls
we
feel
amain
the
close
of
troilus
and
cressid
sweet
hence
pageant
history
hence
gilded
cheat
swart
planet
in
the
universe
of
deeds
wide
sea
that
one
continuous
murmur
breeds
along
the
pebbled
shore
of
memory
many
old
boats
there
be
upon
thy
vaporous
bosom
magnified
to
goodly
vessels
many
a
sail
of
pride
and
golden
keel
is
left
unlaunch
and
dry
but
wherefore
this
what
care
though
owl
did
fly
about
the
great
athenian
admiral
mast
what
care
though
striding
alexander
past
the
indus
with
his
macedonian
numbers
though
old
ulysses
tortured
from
his
slumbers
the
glutted
cyclops
what
care
juliet
leaning
amid
her
sighing
weaning
tenderly
her
fancy
from
its
maiden
snow
doth
more
avail
than
these
the
silver
flow
of
hero
tears
the
swoon
of
imogen
fair
pastorella
in
the
bandit
den
are
things
to
brood
on
with
more
ardency
than
the
of
empires
fearfully
must
such
conviction
come
upon
his
head
who
thus
far
discontent
has
dared
to
tread
without
one
muse
smile
or
kind
behest
the
path
of
love
and
poesy
but
rest
in
chaffing
restlessness
is
yet
more
drear
than
to
be
crush
in
striving
to
uprear
love
standard
on
the
battlements
of
song
so
once
more
days
and
nights
aid
me
along
like
legion
soldiers
shepherd
prince
what
promise
hast
thou
faithful
guarded
since
the
day
of
sacrifice
or
have
new
sorrows
come
with
the
constant
dawn
upon
thy
morrows
alas
is
his
old
grief
for
many
days
has
he
been
wandering
in
uncertain
ways
through
wilderness
and
woods
of
mossed
oaks
counting
his
minutes
by
the
strokes
of
the
lone
woodcutter
and
listening
still
hour
after
hour
to
each
rill
now
he
is
sitting
by
a
shady
spring
and
with
feverous
fingering
stems
the
upbursting
cold
a
wild
rose
tree
pavilions
him
in
bloom
and
he
doth
see
a
bud
which
snares
his
fancy
lo
but
now
he
plucks
it
dips
its
stalk
in
the
water
how
it
swells
it
buds
it
flowers
beneath
his
sight
and
in
the
middle
there
is
softly
pight
a
golden
butterfly
upon
whose
wings
there
must
be
surely
character
strange
things
for
with
wide
eye
he
wonders
and
smiles
oft
lightly
this
little
herald
flew
aloft
follow
by
glad
endymion
clasped
hands
onward
it
flies
from
languor
sullen
bands
his
limbs
are
loos
and
eager
on
he
hies
dazzled
to
trace
it
in
the
sunny
skies
it
seem
he
flew
the
way
so
easy
was
and
like
a
spirit
did
he
pass
through
the
green
evening
quiet
in
the
sun
many
a
heath
through
many
a
woodland
dun
through
buried
paths
where
sleepy
twilight
dreams
the
summer
time
away
one
track
unseams
a
wooded
cleft
and
far
away
the
blue
of
ocean
fades
upon
him
then
anew
he
sinks
adown
a
solitary
glen
where
there
was
never
sound
of
mortal
men
saving
perhaps
some
cadences
melting
to
silence
when
upon
the
breeze
some
holy
bark
let
forth
an
anthem
sweet
to
cheer
itself
to
delphi
still
his
feet
went
swift
beneath
the
guide
until
it
reached
a
splashing
fountain
side
that
near
a
cavern
mouth
for
ever
unto
the
temperate
air
then
high
it
soar
and
downward
suddenly
began
to
dip
as
if
athirst
with
so
much
toil
sip
the
crystal
so
it
did
with
touch
most
delicate
as
though
afraid
to
smutch
even
with
mealy
gold
the
waters
clear
but
at
that
very
touch
to
disappear
so
was
strange
bewildered
endymion
sought
around
and
shook
each
bed
of
covert
flowers
in
vain
and
then
he
flung
himself
along
the
grass
what
gentle
tongue
what
whisperer
disturb
his
gloomy
rest
it
was
a
nymph
uprisen
to
the
breast
in
the
fountain
pebbly
margin
and
she
stood
lilies
like
the
youngest
of
the
brood
to
him
her
dripping
hand
she
softly
kist
and
anxiously
began
to
plait
and
twist
her
ringlets
round
her
fingers
saying
youth
too
long
alas
hast
thou
starv
on
the
ruth
the
bitterness
of
love
too
long
indeed
seeing
thou
art
so
gentle
could
i
weed
thy
soul
of
care
by
heavens
i
would
offer
all
the
bright
riches
of
my
crystal
coffer
to
amphitrite
all
my
fish
golden
or
or
purplish
or
finn
with
silvery
gauze
yea
or
my
veined
that
draws
a
virgin
light
to
the
deep
my
tawny
and
gold
ooz
slowly
from
far
lands
by
my
diligent
springs
my
level
lilies
shells
my
charming
rod
my
potent
river
spells
yes
every
thing
even
to
the
pearly
cup
meander
gave
me
for
i
bubbled
up
to
fainting
creatures
in
a
desert
wild
but
woe
is
me
i
am
but
as
a
child
to
gladden
thee
and
all
i
dare
to
say
is
that
i
pity
thee
that
on
this
day
i
been
thy
guide
that
thou
must
wander
far
in
other
regions
past
the
scanty
bar
to
mortal
steps
before
thou
be
from
every
wasting
sigh
from
every
pain
into
the
gentle
bosom
of
thy
love
why
it
is
thus
one
knows
in
heaven
above
but
a
poor
naiad
i
guess
not
farewel
i
have
a
ditty
for
my
hollow
cell
hereat
she
vanished
from
endymion
gaze
who
brooded
the
water
in
amaze
the
dashing
fount
pour
on
and
where
its
pool
lay
half
asleep
in
grass
and
rushes
cool
quick
waterflies
and
gnats
were
sporting
still
and
fish
were
dimpling
as
if
good
nor
ill
had
fallen
out
that
hour
the
wanderer
holding
his
forehead
to
keep
off
the
burr
of
smothering
fancies
patiently
sat
down
and
while
beneath
the
evening
sleepy
frown
began
to
trim
their
starry
lamps
thus
breath
he
to
himself
whoso
encamps
to
take
a
fancied
city
of
delight
o
what
a
wretch
is
he
and
when
is
his
after
long
toil
and
travelling
to
miss
the
kernel
of
his
hopes
how
more
than
vile
yet
for
him
there
refreshment
even
in
toil
another
city
doth
he
set
about
free
from
the
smallest
of
doubt
that
he
will
seize
on
trickling
alas
he
finds
them
dry
and
then
he
foams
and
onward
to
another
city
speeds
but
this
is
human
life
the
war
the
deeds
the
disappointment
the
anxiety
imagination
struggles
far
and
nigh
all
human
bearing
in
themselves
this
good
that
they
are
still
the
air
the
subtle
food
to
make
us
feel
existence
and
to
shew
how
quiet
death
is
where
soil
is
men
grow
whether
to
weeds
or
flowers
but
for
me
there
is
no
depth
to
strike
in
i
can
see
nought
earthly
worth
my
compassing
so
stand
upon
a
misty
jutting
head
of
land
alone
no
no
and
by
the
orphean
lute
when
mad
eurydice
is
listening
i
rather
stand
upon
this
misty
peak
with
not
a
thing
to
sigh
for
or
to
seek
but
the
soft
shadow
of
my
love
than
be
i
care
not
what
o
meekest
dove
of
heaven
o
cynthia
bright
and
fair
from
thy
blue
throne
now
filling
all
the
air
glance
but
one
little
beam
of
temper
light
into
my
bosom
that
the
dreadful
might
and
tyranny
of
love
be
somewhat
scar
yet
do
not
so
sweet
queen
one
torment
spar
would
give
a
pang
to
jealous
misery
worse
than
the
torment
self
but
rather
tie
large
wings
upon
my
shoulders
and
point
out
my
love
far
dwelling
though
the
playful
rout
of
cupids
shun
thee
too
divine
art
thou
too
keen
in
beauty
for
thy
silver
prow
not
to
have
dipp
in
love
most
gentle
stream
o
be
propitious
nor
severely
deem
my
madness
impious
for
by
all
the
stars
that
tend
thy
bidding
i
do
think
the
bars
that
kept
my
spirit
in
are
burst
that
i
am
sailing
with
thee
through
the
dizzy
sky
how
beautiful
thou
art
the
world
how
deep
how
the
wheels
sweep
around
their
axle
then
these
gleaming
reins
how
lithe
when
this
thy
chariot
attains
its
airy
goal
haply
some
bower
veils
those
twilight
eyes
those
eyes
my
spirit
fails
dear
goddess
help
or
the
air
will
gulph
me
help
at
this
with
madden
stare
and
lifted
hands
and
trembling
lips
he
stood
like
old
deucalion
mountain
the
flood
or
blind
orion
hungry
for
the
morn
and
but
from
the
deep
cavern
there
was
borne
a
voice
he
had
been
froze
to
senseless
stone
nor
sigh
of
his
nor
plaint
nor
passion
moan
had
more
been
heard
thus
swell
it
forth
descend
young
mountaineer
descend
where
alleys
bend
into
the
sparry
hollows
of
the
world
oft
hast
thou
seen
bolts
of
the
thunder
as
from
thy
threshold
day
by
day
hast
been
a
little
lower
than
the
chilly
sheen
of
icy
pinnacles
and
thine
arms
into
the
deadening
ether
that
still
charms
their
marble
being
now
as
deep
profound
as
those
are
high
descend
he
is
with
immortality
who
fears
to
follow
where
airy
voices
lead
so
through
the
hollow
the
silent
mysteries
of
earth
descend
he
heard
but
the
last
words
nor
could
contend
one
moment
in
reflection
for
he
fled
into
the
fearful
deep
to
hide
his
head
from
the
clear
moon
the
trees
and
coming
madness
was
far
too
strange
and
wonderful
for
sadness
sharpening
by
degrees
his
appetite
to
dive
into
the
deepest
dark
nor
light
the
region
nor
bright
nor
sombre
wholly
but
mingled
up
a
gleaming
melancholy
a
dusky
empire
and
its
diadems
one
faint
eternal
eventide
of
gems
aye
millions
sparkled
on
a
vein
of
gold
along
whose
track
the
prince
quick
footsteps
told
with
all
its
lines
abrupt
and
angular
sometimes
like
a
through
a
vast
antre
then
the
metal
woof
like
vulcan
rainbow
with
some
monstrous
roof
curves
hugely
now
far
in
the
deep
abyss
it
seems
an
angry
lightning
and
doth
hiss
fancy
into
belief
anon
it
leads
through
winding
passages
where
sameness
breeds
vexing
conceptions
of
some
sudden
change
whether
to
silver
grots
or
giant
range
of
sapphire
columns
or
fantastic
bridge
athwart
a
flood
of
crystal
on
a
ridge
now
fareth
he
that
the
vast
beneath
towers
like
an
and
whence
he
seeth
a
hundred
waterfalls
whose
voices
come
but
as
the
murmuring
surge
chilly
and
numb
his
bosom
grew
when
first
he
far
away
descried
an
orbed
diamond
set
to
fray
old
darkness
from
his
throne
was
like
the
sun
uprisen
chaos
and
with
such
a
stun
came
the
amazement
that
absorb
in
it
he
saw
not
fiercer
wonders
past
the
wit
of
any
spirit
to
tell
but
one
of
those
who
when
this
planet
sphering
time
doth
close
will
be
its
high
remembrancers
who
they
the
mighty
ones
who
have
made
eternal
day
for
greece
and
england
while
astonishment
with
sighs
was
quieting
he
went
into
a
marble
gallery
passing
through
a
mimic
temple
so
complete
and
true
in
sacred
custom
that
he
well
nigh
to
search
it
inwards
whence
far
off
appear
through
a
long
pillar
vista
a
fair
shrine
and
just
beyond
on
light
tiptoe
divine
a
quiver
dian
stepping
awfully
the
youth
approach
oft
turning
his
veil
eye
down
sidelong
aisles
and
into
niches
old
and
when
more
near
against
the
marble
cold
he
had
touch
his
forehead
he
began
to
thread
all
courts
and
passages
where
silence
dead
rous
by
his
whispering
footsteps
murmured
faint
and
long
he
travers
to
and
fro
to
acquaint
himself
with
every
mystery
and
awe
till
weary
he
sat
down
before
the
maw
of
a
wide
outlet
fathomless
and
dim
to
wild
uncertainty
and
shadows
grim
there
when
new
wonders
ceas
to
float
before
and
thoughts
of
self
came
on
how
crude
and
sore
the
journey
homeward
to
habitual
self
a
of
the
elf
whose
flitting
lantern
through
rude
cheats
us
into
a
swamp
into
a
fire
into
the
bosom
of
a
hated
thing
what
misery
most
drowningly
doth
sing
in
lone
endymion
ear
now
he
has
caught
the
goal
of
consciousness
ah
is
the
thought
the
deadly
feel
of
solitude
for
lo
he
can
not
see
the
heavens
nor
the
flow
of
rivers
nor
running
wild
in
pink
and
purple
chequer
nor
the
cloudy
rack
slow
journeying
in
the
west
like
herded
elephants
nor
felt
nor
prest
cool
grass
nor
tasted
the
fresh
slumberous
air
but
far
from
such
companionship
to
wear
an
unknown
time
surcharg
with
grief
away
was
now
his
lot
and
must
he
patient
stay
tracing
fantastic
figures
with
his
spear
no
exclaimed
he
why
should
i
tarry
here
no
loudly
echoed
times
innumerable
at
which
he
straightway
started
and
tell
his
paces
back
into
the
temple
chief
warming
and
growing
strong
in
the
belief
of
help
from
dian
so
that
when
again
he
caught
her
airy
form
thus
did
he
plain
moving
more
near
the
while
o
haunter
chaste
of
river
sides
and
woods
and
heathy
waste
where
with
thy
silver
bow
and
arrows
keen
art
thou
now
forested
o
woodland
queen
what
smoothest
air
thy
smoother
forehead
woos
where
dost
thou
listen
to
the
wide
halloos
of
thy
disparted
nymphs
through
what
dark
tree
glimmers
thy
crescent
it
be
is
in
the
breath
of
heaven
thou
dost
taste
freedom
as
none
can
taste
it
nor
dost
waste
thy
loveliness
in
dismal
elements
but
finding
in
our
green
earth
sweet
contents
there
livest
blissfully
ah
if
to
thee
it
feels
elysian
how
rich
to
me
an
exil
mortal
sounds
its
pleasant
name
within
my
breast
there
lives
a
choking
flame
o
let
me
cool
it
among
the
a
homeward
fever
parches
up
my
tongue
o
let
me
slake
it
at
the
running
springs
upon
my
car
a
noisy
nothing
rings
o
let
me
once
more
hear
the
linnet
note
before
mine
eyes
thick
films
and
shadows
float
o
let
me
them
with
the
heaven
light
dost
thou
now
lave
thy
feet
and
ankles
white
o
think
how
sweet
to
me
the
freshening
sluice
dost
thou
now
please
thy
thirst
with
o
think
how
this
dry
palate
would
rejoice
if
in
soft
slumber
thou
dost
hear
my
voice
o
think
how
i
should
love
a
bed
of
flowers
young
goddess
let
me
see
my
native
bowers
deliver
me
from
this
rapacious
deep
thus
ending
loudly
as
he
would
his
destiny
alert
he
stood
but
when
obstinate
silence
came
heavily
again
feeling
about
for
its
old
couch
of
space
and
airy
cradle
lowly
bow
his
face
desponding
the
marble
floor
cold
thrill
but
was
not
long
for
sweeter
than
the
rill
to
its
old
channel
or
a
swollen
tide
to
margin
sallows
were
the
leaves
he
spied
and
flowers
and
wreaths
and
ready
myrtle
crowns
up
heaping
through
the
slab
refreshment
drowns
itself
and
strives
its
own
delights
to
hide
nor
in
one
spot
alone
the
floral
pride
in
a
long
whispering
birth
enchanted
grew
before
his
footsteps
as
when
heav
anew
old
ocean
rolls
a
lengthened
wave
to
the
shore
down
whose
green
back
the
foam
all
hoar
bursts
gradual
with
a
wayward
indolence
increasing
still
in
heart
and
pleasant
sense
upon
his
fairy
journey
on
he
hastes
so
anxious
for
the
end
he
scarcely
wastes
one
moment
with
his
hand
among
the
sweets
onward
he
goes
he
stops
his
bosom
beats
as
plainly
in
his
ear
as
the
faint
charm
of
which
the
throbs
were
born
this
still
alarm
this
sleepy
music
forc
him
walk
tiptoe
for
it
came
more
softly
than
the
east
could
blow
arion
magic
to
the
atlantic
isles
or
than
the
west
made
jealous
by
the
smiles
of
thron
apollo
could
breathe
back
the
lyre
to
seas
ionian
and
tyrian
o
did
he
ever
live
that
lonely
man
who
lov
and
music
slew
not
is
the
pest
of
love
that
fairest
joys
give
most
unrest
that
things
of
delicate
and
tenderest
worth
are
swallow
all
and
made
a
seared
dearth
by
one
consuming
flame
it
doth
immerse
and
suffocate
true
blessings
in
a
curse
by
comparison
of
bliss
is
miserable
was
even
so
with
this
melody
in
the
carian
ear
first
heaven
then
hell
and
then
forgotten
clear
vanish
in
elemental
passion
and
down
some
swart
abysm
he
had
gone
had
not
a
heavenly
guide
benignant
led
to
where
thick
myrtle
branches
his
head
brushing
awakened
then
the
sounds
again
went
noiseless
as
a
passing
noontide
rain
over
a
bower
where
little
space
he
stood
for
as
the
sunset
peeps
into
a
wood
so
saw
he
panting
light
and
towards
it
went
through
winding
alleys
and
lo
wonderment
upon
soft
verdure
saw
one
here
one
there
cupids
a
slumbering
on
their
pinions
fair
after
a
thousand
mazes
overgone
at
last
with
sudden
step
he
came
upon
a
chamber
myrtle
wall
embowered
high
full
of
light
incense
tender
minstrelsy
and
more
of
beautiful
and
strange
beside
for
on
a
silken
couch
of
rosy
pride
in
midst
of
all
there
lay
a
sleeping
youth
of
fondest
beauty
fonder
in
fair
sooth
than
sighs
could
fathom
or
contentment
reach
and
coverlids
like
the
peach
or
ripe
october
faded
marigolds
fell
sleek
about
him
in
a
thousand
folds
not
hiding
up
an
apollonian
curve
of
neck
and
shoulder
nor
the
tenting
swerve
of
knee
from
knee
nor
ankles
pointing
light
but
rather
giving
them
to
the
filled
sight
officiously
sideway
his
face
on
one
white
arm
and
tenderly
unclos
by
tenderest
pressure
a
faint
damask
mouth
to
slumbery
pout
just
as
the
morning
south
disparts
a
rose
above
his
head
four
lily
stalks
did
their
white
honours
wed
to
make
a
coronal
and
round
him
grew
all
tendrils
green
of
every
bloom
and
hue
together
intertwin
and
trammel
fresh
the
vine
of
glossy
sprout
the
ivy
mesh
shading
its
ethiop
berries
and
woodbine
of
velvet
leaves
and
divine
convolvulus
in
streaked
vases
flush
the
creeper
mellowing
for
an
autumn
blush
and
virgin
bower
trailing
airily
with
others
of
the
sisterhood
hard
by
stood
serene
cupids
watching
silently
one
kneeling
to
a
lyre
touch
the
strings
muffling
to
death
the
pathos
with
his
wings
and
ever
and
anon
uprose
to
look
at
the
youth
slumber
while
another
took
a
distilling
odorous
dew
and
shook
it
on
his
hair
another
flew
in
through
the
woven
roof
and
rain
violets
upon
his
sleeping
eyes
at
these
enchantments
and
yet
many
more
the
breathless
latmian
wonder
and
until
impatient
in
embarrassment
he
forthright
pass
and
lightly
treading
went
to
that
same
feather
lyrist
who
straightway
smiling
thus
whisper
though
from
upper
day
thou
art
a
wanderer
and
thy
presence
here
might
seem
unholy
be
of
happy
cheer
for
is
the
nicest
touch
of
human
honour
when
some
ethereal
and
donor
presents
immortal
bowers
to
mortal
sense
as
now
is
done
to
thee
endymion
hence
was
i
in
no
wise
startled
so
recline
upon
these
living
flowers
here
is
wine
alive
with
sparkles
never
i
aver
since
ariadne
was
a
vintager
so
cool
a
purple
taste
these
juicy
pears
sent
me
by
sad
vertumnus
when
his
fears
were
high
about
pomona
here
is
cream
deepening
to
richness
from
a
snowy
gleam
sweeter
than
that
nurse
amalthea
for
the
boy
jupiter
and
here
undimm
by
any
touch
a
bunch
of
blooming
plums
ready
to
melt
between
an
infant
gums
and
here
is
manna
pick
from
syrian
trees
in
starlight
by
the
three
hesperides
feast
on
and
meanwhile
i
will
let
thee
know
of
all
these
things
around
us
he
did
so
still
brooding
the
cadence
of
his
lyre
and
thus
i
need
not
any
hearing
tire
by
telling
how
the
goddess
for
a
mortal
youth
and
how
she
strove
to
bind
him
all
in
all
unto
her
doting
self
who
would
not
be
so
prison
but
fond
elf
he
was
content
to
let
her
amorous
plea
faint
through
his
careless
arms
content
to
see
an
unseiz
heaven
dying
at
his
feet
content
o
fool
to
make
a
cold
retreat
when
on
the
pleasant
grass
such
love
lovelorn
lay
sorrowing
when
every
tear
was
born
of
diverse
passion
when
her
lips
and
eyes
were
clos
in
sullen
moisture
and
quick
sighs
came
vex
and
pettish
through
her
nostrils
small
hush
no
exclaim
yet
justly
mightst
thou
call
curses
upon
his
i
was
half
glad
but
my
poor
mistress
went
distract
and
mad
when
the
boar
tusk
him
so
away
she
flew
to
jove
high
throne
and
by
her
plainings
drew
immortal
down
the
thunderer
beard
whereon
it
was
decreed
he
should
be
each
summer
time
to
life
lo
this
is
he
that
same
adonis
safe
in
the
privacy
of
this
still
region
all
his
aye
sleep
for
when
our
queen
did
weep
over
his
waned
corse
the
tremulous
shower
heal
up
the
wound
and
with
a
balmy
power
medicined
death
to
a
lengthened
drowsiness
the
which
she
fills
with
visions
and
doth
dress
in
all
this
quiet
luxury
and
hath
set
us
young
immortals
without
any
let
to
watch
his
slumber
through
is
well
nigh
pass
even
to
a
moment
filling
up
and
fast
she
scuds
with
summer
breezes
to
pant
through
the
first
long
kiss
warm
firstling
to
renew
embower
sports
in
cytherea
isle
look
how
those
winged
listeners
all
this
while
stand
anxious
see
behold
this
clamant
word
broke
through
the
careful
silence
for
they
heard
a
rustling
noise
of
leaves
and
out
there
pigeons
and
doves
adonis
something
mutter
the
while
one
hand
that
erst
upon
his
thigh
lay
dormant
mov
convuls
and
gradually
up
to
his
forehead
then
there
was
a
hum
of
sudden
voices
echoing
come
come
arise
awake
clear
summer
has
forth
unto
the
and
she
has
full
soothingly
to
every
nested
finch
rise
cupids
or
we
give
the
pinch
to
your
dimpled
arms
once
more
sweet
life
begin
at
this
from
every
side
they
hurried
in
rubbing
their
sleepy
eyes
with
lazy
wrists
and
doubling
over
head
their
little
fists
in
backward
yawns
but
all
were
soon
alive
for
as
delicious
wine
doth
sparkling
dive
in
nectar
clouds
and
curls
through
water
fair
so
from
the
arbour
roof
down
swell
an
air
odorous
and
enlivening
making
all
to
laugh
and
play
and
sing
and
loudly
call
for
their
sweet
queen
when
lo
the
wreathed
green
disparted
and
far
upward
could
be
seen
blue
heaven
and
a
silver
car
whose
silent
wheels
fresh
wet
from
clouds
of
morn
spun
off
a
drizzling
dew
which
falling
chill
on
soft
adonis
shoulders
made
him
still
nestle
and
turn
uneasily
about
soon
were
the
white
doves
plain
with
necks
stretch
out
and
silken
traces
lighten
in
descent
and
soon
returning
from
love
banishment
queen
venus
leaning
downward
open
arm
her
shadow
fell
upon
his
breast
and
a
tumult
to
his
heart
and
a
new
life
into
his
eyes
ah
miserable
strife
but
for
her
comforting
unhappy
sight
but
meeting
her
blue
orbs
who
who
can
write
of
these
first
minutes
the
unchariest
muse
to
embracements
warm
as
theirs
makes
coy
excuse
o
it
has
ruffled
every
spirit
there
saving
love
self
who
stands
superb
to
share
the
general
gladness
awfully
he
stands
a
sovereign
quell
is
in
his
waving
hands
no
sight
can
bear
the
lightning
of
his
bow
his
quiver
is
mysterious
none
can
know
what
themselves
think
of
it
from
forth
his
eyes
there
darts
strange
light
of
varied
hues
and
dyes
a
scowl
is
sometimes
on
his
brow
but
who
look
full
upon
it
feel
anon
the
blue
of
his
fair
eyes
run
liquid
through
their
souls
endymion
feels
it
and
no
more
controls
the
burning
prayer
within
him
so
bent
low
he
had
begun
a
plaining
of
his
woe
but
venus
bending
forward
said
my
child
favour
this
gentle
youth
his
days
are
wild
with
love
he
but
alas
too
well
i
see
thou
the
deepness
of
his
misery
ah
smile
not
so
my
son
i
tell
thee
true
that
when
through
heavy
hours
i
used
to
rue
the
endless
sleep
of
this
adon
this
stranger
ay
i
pitied
for
upon
a
dreary
morning
once
i
fled
away
into
the
breezy
clouds
to
weep
and
pray
for
this
my
love
for
vexing
mars
had
me
even
to
tears
thence
when
a
little
eas
vacant
through
a
hazy
wood
i
saw
this
youth
as
he
despairing
stood
those
same
dark
curls
blown
vagrant
in
the
wind
those
same
full
fringed
lids
a
constant
blind
over
his
sullen
eyes
i
saw
him
throw
himself
on
wither
leaves
even
as
though
death
had
come
sudden
for
no
jot
he
mov
yet
mutter
wildly
i
could
hear
he
some
fair
immortal
and
that
his
embrace
had
zoned
her
through
the
night
there
is
no
trace
of
this
in
heaven
i
have
mark
each
cheek
and
find
it
is
the
vainest
thing
to
seek
and
that
of
all
things
is
kept
secretest
endymion
one
day
thou
wilt
be
blest
so
still
obey
the
guiding
hand
that
fends
thee
safely
through
these
wonders
for
sweet
ends
is
a
concealment
needful
in
extreme
and
if
i
guess
not
so
the
sunny
beam
thou
shouldst
mount
up
to
with
me
now
adieu
here
must
we
leave
thee
at
these
words
up
flew
the
impatient
doves
up
rose
the
floating
car
up
went
the
hum
celestial
high
afar
the
latmian
saw
them
minish
into
nought
and
when
all
were
clear
vanish
still
he
caught
a
vivid
lightning
from
that
dreadful
bow
when
all
was
darkened
with
etnean
throe
the
earth
clos
gave
a
solitary
moan
and
left
him
once
again
in
twilight
lone
he
did
not
rave
he
did
not
stare
aghast
for
all
those
visions
were
and
past
and
he
in
loneliness
he
felt
of
happy
times
when
all
he
had
would
seem
a
feather
to
the
mighty
prize
so
with
unusual
gladness
on
he
hies
through
caves
and
palaces
of
mottled
ore
gold
dome
and
crystal
wall
and
turquois
floor
black
polish
porticos
of
awful
shade
and
at
the
last
a
diamond
balustrade
leading
afar
past
wild
magnificence
spiral
through
ruggedest
loopholes
and
thence
stretching
across
a
void
then
guiding
enormous
chasms
where
all
foam
and
roar
streams
subterranean
tease
their
granite
beds
then
heighten
just
above
the
silvery
heads
of
a
thousand
fountains
so
that
he
could
dash
the
waters
with
his
spear
but
at
the
splash
done
heedlessly
those
spouting
columns
rose
sudden
a
poplar
height
and
to
enclose
his
diamond
path
with
fretwork
streaming
round
alive
and
dazzling
cool
and
with
a
sound
haply
like
dolphin
tumults
when
sweet
shells
welcome
the
float
of
thetis
long
he
dwells
on
this
delight
for
every
minute
space
the
streams
with
changed
magic
interlace
sometimes
like
delicatest
lattices
cover
with
crystal
vines
then
weeping
trees
moving
about
as
in
a
gentle
wind
which
in
a
wink
to
watery
gauze
refin
pour
into
shapes
of
curtain
canopies
spangled
and
rich
with
liquid
broideries
of
flowers
peacocks
swans
and
naiads
fair
swifter
than
lightning
went
these
wonders
rare
and
then
the
water
into
stubborn
streams
collecting
mimick
the
wrought
oaken
beams
pillars
and
frieze
and
high
fantastic
roof
of
those
dusk
places
in
times
far
aloof
cathedrals
call
he
bade
a
loth
farewel
to
these
founts
protean
passing
gulph
and
dell
and
torrent
and
ten
thousand
jutting
shapes
half
seen
through
deepest
gloom
and
griesly
gapes
blackening
on
every
side
and
overhead
a
vaulted
dome
like
heaven
far
bespread
with
starlight
gems
aye
all
so
huge
and
strange
the
solitary
felt
a
hurried
change
working
within
him
into
something
dreary
vex
like
a
morning
eagle
lost
and
weary
and
purblind
amid
foggy
midnight
wolds
but
he
revives
at
once
for
who
beholds
new
sudden
things
nor
casts
his
mental
slough
forth
from
a
rugged
arch
in
the
dusk
below
came
mother
cybele
alone
alone
in
sombre
chariot
dark
foldings
thrown
about
her
majesty
and
front
with
turrets
crown
four
maned
lions
hale
the
sluggish
wheels
solemn
their
toothed
maws
their
surly
eyes
heavy
paws
uplifted
drowsily
and
nervy
tails
cowering
their
tawny
brushes
silent
sails
this
shadowy
queen
athwart
and
faints
away
in
another
gloomy
arch
wherefore
delay
young
traveller
in
such
a
mournful
place
art
thou
wayworn
or
canst
not
further
trace
the
diamond
path
and
does
it
indeed
end
abrupt
in
middle
air
yet
earthward
bend
thy
forehead
and
to
jupiter
call
ardently
he
was
indeed
wayworn
abrupt
in
middle
air
his
way
was
lost
to
jove
he
bowed
and
there
crost
towards
him
a
large
eagle
whose
wings
without
one
impious
word
himself
he
flings
committed
to
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
down
down
uncertain
to
what
pleasant
doom
swift
as
a
fathoming
plummet
down
he
fell
through
unknown
things
till
exhaled
asphodel
and
rose
with
spicy
fannings
interbreath
came
swelling
forth
where
little
caves
were
so
thick
with
leaves
and
mosses
that
they
large
of
green
and
freshly
with
airs
delicious
in
the
greenest
nook
the
eagle
landed
him
and
farewel
took
it
was
a
jasmine
bower
all
bestrown
with
golden
moss
his
every
sense
had
grown
ethereal
for
pleasure
his
head
flew
a
delight
his
tread
was
hesperean
to
his
capable
ears
silence
was
music
from
the
holy
spheres
a
dewy
luxury
was
in
his
eyes
the
little
flowers
felt
his
pleasant
sighs
and
stirr
them
faintly
verdant
cave
and
cell
he
wander
through
oft
wondering
at
such
swell
of
sudden
exaltation
but
alas
said
he
will
all
this
gush
of
feeling
pass
away
in
solitude
and
must
they
wane
like
melodies
upon
a
sandy
plain
without
an
echo
then
shall
i
be
left
so
sad
so
melancholy
so
bereft
yet
still
i
feel
immortal
o
my
love
my
breath
of
life
where
art
thou
high
above
dancing
before
the
morning
gates
of
heaven
or
keeping
watch
among
those
starry
seven
old
atlas
children
art
a
maid
of
the
waters
one
of
triton
daughters
or
art
impossible
a
nymph
of
dian
weaving
a
coronal
of
tender
scions
for
very
idleness
thou
art
methinks
it
now
is
at
my
will
to
start
into
thine
arms
to
scare
aurora
train
and
snatch
thee
from
the
morning
the
main
to
scud
like
a
wild
bird
and
take
thee
off
from
thy
cradle
or
to
doff
thy
shepherd
vest
and
woo
thee
mid
fresh
leaves
no
no
too
eagerly
my
soul
deceives
its
powerless
self
i
know
this
can
not
be
o
let
me
then
by
some
sweet
dreaming
flee
to
her
entrancements
hither
sleep
awhile
hither
most
gentle
sleep
and
soothing
foil
for
some
few
hours
the
coming
solitude
thus
spake
he
and
that
moment
felt
endued
with
power
to
dream
deliciously
so
wound
through
a
dim
passage
searching
till
he
found
the
smoothest
mossy
bed
and
deepest
where
he
threw
himself
and
just
into
the
air
stretching
his
indolent
arms
he
took
o
bliss
a
naked
waist
fair
cupid
whence
is
this
a
voice
sigh
sweetest
here
am
i
at
which
soft
ravishment
with
doating
cry
they
trembled
to
each
helicon
o
fountain
hill
old
homer
helicon
that
thou
wouldst
spout
a
little
streamlet
these
sorry
pages
then
the
verse
would
soar
and
sing
above
this
gentle
pair
like
lark
over
his
nested
young
but
all
is
dark
around
thine
aged
top
and
thy
clear
fount
exhales
in
mists
to
heaven
aye
the
count
of
mighty
poets
is
made
up
the
scroll
is
folded
by
the
muses
the
bright
roll
is
in
apollo
hand
our
dazed
eyes
have
seen
a
new
tinge
in
the
western
skies
the
world
has
done
its
duty
yet
oh
yet
although
the
sun
of
poesy
is
set
these
lovers
did
embrace
and
we
must
weep
that
there
is
no
old
power
left
to
steep
a
quill
immortal
in
their
joyous
tears
long
time
in
silence
did
their
anxious
fears
question
that
thus
it
was
long
time
they
lay
fondling
and
kissing
every
doubt
away
long
time
ere
soft
caressing
sobs
began
to
mellow
into
words
and
then
there
ran
two
bubbling
springs
of
talk
from
their
sweet
lips
o
known
unknown
from
whom
my
being
sips
such
darling
essence
wherefore
may
i
not
be
ever
in
these
arms
in
this
sweet
spot
pillow
my
chin
for
ever
ever
press
these
toying
hands
and
kiss
their
smooth
excess
why
not
for
ever
and
for
ever
feel
that
breath
about
my
eyes
ah
thou
wilt
steal
away
from
me
again
indeed
indeed
thou
wilt
be
gone
away
and
wilt
not
heed
my
lonely
madness
speak
my
kindest
fair
is
is
it
to
be
so
no
who
will
dare
to
pluck
thee
from
me
and
of
thine
own
will
full
well
i
feel
thou
wouldst
not
leave
me
still
let
me
entwine
thee
surer
surer
now
how
can
we
part
elysium
who
art
thou
who
that
thou
canst
not
be
for
ever
here
or
lift
me
with
thee
to
some
starry
sphere
enchantress
tell
me
by
this
soft
embrace
by
the
most
soft
completion
of
thy
face
those
lips
o
slippery
blisses
twinkling
eyes
and
by
these
tenderest
milky
sovereignties
these
tenderest
and
by
the
the
passion
o
lov
ida
the
divine
endymion
dearest
ah
unhappy
me
his
soul
will
us
o
felicity
how
he
does
love
me
his
poor
temples
beat
to
the
very
tune
of
love
how
sweet
sweet
sweet
revive
dear
youth
or
i
shall
faint
and
die
revive
or
these
soft
hours
will
hurry
by
in
tranced
dulness
speak
and
let
that
spell
affright
this
lethargy
i
can
not
quell
its
heavy
pressure
and
will
press
at
least
my
lips
to
thine
that
they
may
richly
feast
until
we
taste
the
life
of
love
again
what
dost
thou
move
dost
kiss
o
bliss
o
pain
i
love
thee
youth
more
than
i
can
conceive
and
so
long
absence
from
thee
doth
bereave
my
soul
of
any
rest
yet
must
i
hence
yet
can
i
not
to
starry
eminence
uplift
thee
nor
for
very
shame
can
own
myself
to
thee
ah
dearest
do
not
groan
or
thou
wilt
force
me
from
this
secrecy
and
i
must
blush
in
heaven
o
that
i
had
done
it
already
that
the
dreadful
smiles
at
my
lost
brightness
my
impassion
wiles
had
waned
from
olympus
solemn
height
and
from
all
serious
gods
that
our
delight
was
quite
forgotten
save
of
us
alone
and
wherefore
so
ashamed
is
but
to
atone
for
endless
pleasure
by
some
coward
blushes
yet
must
i
be
a
coward
honour
rushes
too
palpable
before
me
the
sad
look
of
jove
minerva
start
no
bosom
shook
with
awe
of
purity
no
cupid
pinion
in
reverence
veiled
my
crystalline
dominion
half
lost
and
all
old
hymns
made
nullity
but
what
is
this
to
love
o
i
could
fly
with
thee
into
the
ken
of
heavenly
powers
so
thou
wouldst
thus
for
many
sequent
hours
press
me
so
sweetly
now
i
swear
at
once
that
i
am
wise
that
pallas
is
a
dunce
perhaps
her
love
like
mine
is
but
unknown
o
i
do
think
that
i
have
been
alone
in
chastity
yes
pallas
has
been
sighing
while
every
eye
saw
me
my
hair
uptying
with
fingers
cool
as
aspen
leaves
sweet
love
i
was
as
vague
as
solitary
dove
nor
knew
that
nests
were
built
now
a
soft
kiss
aye
by
that
kiss
i
vow
an
endless
bliss
an
immortality
of
passion
thine
ere
long
i
will
exalt
thee
to
the
shine
of
heaven
ambrosial
and
we
will
shade
ourselves
whole
summers
by
a
river
glade
and
i
will
tell
thee
stories
of
the
sky
and
breathe
thee
whispers
of
its
minstrelsy
my
happy
love
will
overwing
all
bounds
o
let
me
melt
into
thee
let
the
sounds
of
our
close
voices
marry
at
their
birth
let
us
entwine
hoveringly
o
dearth
of
human
words
roughness
of
mortal
speech
lispings
empyrean
will
i
sometime
teach
thine
honied
tongue
which
i
gasp
to
have
thee
understand
now
while
i
clasp
thee
thus
and
weep
for
fondness
i
am
pain
endymion
woe
woe
is
grief
in
the
very
deeps
of
pleasure
my
sole
life
hereat
with
many
sobs
her
gentle
strife
melted
into
a
languor
he
entranced
vows
and
tears
ye
who
have
yearn
with
too
much
passion
will
here
stay
and
pity
for
the
mere
sake
of
truth
as
is
a
ditty
not
of
these
days
but
long
ago
was
told
by
a
cavern
wind
unto
a
forest
old
and
then
the
forest
told
it
in
a
dream
to
a
sleeping
lake
whose
cool
and
level
gleam
a
poet
caught
as
he
was
journeying
to
phœbus
shrine
and
in
it
he
did
fling
his
weary
limbs
bathing
an
hour
space
and
after
straight
in
that
inspired
place
he
sang
the
story
up
into
the
air
giving
it
universal
freedom
there
has
it
been
ever
sounding
for
those
ears
whose
tips
are
glowing
hot
the
legend
cheers
yon
centinel
stars
and
he
who
listens
to
it
must
surely
be
or
he
will
rue
it
for
quenchless
burnings
come
upon
the
heart
made
fiercer
by
a
fear
lest
any
part
should
be
engulphed
in
the
eddying
wind
as
much
as
here
is
penn
doth
always
find
a
resting
place
thus
much
comes
clear
and
plain
anon
the
strange
voice
is
upon
the
wane
and
is
but
echo
from
departing
sound
that
the
fair
visitant
at
last
unwound
her
gentle
limbs
and
left
the
youth
thus
the
tradition
of
the
gusty
deep
now
turn
we
to
our
former
endymion
awoke
that
grief
of
hers
sweet
paining
on
his
ear
he
sickly
how
lone
he
was
once
more
and
sadly
press
his
empty
arms
together
hung
his
head
and
most
forlorn
upon
that
widow
bed
sat
silently
love
madness
he
had
known
often
with
more
than
tortured
lion
groan
moanings
had
burst
from
him
but
now
that
rage
had
pass
away
no
longer
did
he
wage
a
war
against
the
dooming
stars
no
he
had
felt
too
much
for
such
harsh
jars
the
lyre
of
his
soul
eolian
forgot
all
violence
and
but
commun
with
melancholy
thought
o
he
had
drunken
from
pleasure
nipple
and
his
love
henceforth
was
loth
was
he
to
move
from
the
imprinted
couch
and
when
he
did
was
with
slow
languid
paces
and
face
hid
in
muffling
hands
so
temper
out
he
half
seeing
visions
that
might
have
alecto
serpents
ravishments
more
keen
than
hermes
pipe
when
anxious
he
did
lean
over
eclipsing
eyes
and
at
the
last
it
was
a
sounding
grotto
vaulted
vast
studded
with
a
thousand
thousand
pearls
and
crimson
mouthed
shells
with
stubborn
curls
of
every
shape
and
size
even
to
the
bulk
in
which
whales
arbour
close
to
brood
and
sulk
against
an
endless
storm
moreover
too
of
green
and
azure
hue
ready
to
snort
their
streams
in
this
cool
wonder
endymion
sat
down
and
to
ponder
on
all
his
life
his
youth
up
to
the
day
when
acclaim
and
feasts
and
garlands
gay
he
stept
upon
his
shepherd
throne
the
look
of
his
white
palace
in
wild
forest
nook
and
all
the
revels
he
had
lorded
there
each
tender
maiden
whom
he
once
thought
fair
with
every
friend
and
pass
like
a
dream
before
him
then
the
spur
of
the
old
bards
to
mighty
deeds
his
plans
to
nurse
the
golden
age
shepherd
clans
that
wondrous
night
the
great
his
sister
sorrow
and
his
wanderings
all
until
into
the
earth
deep
maw
he
rush
then
all
its
buried
magic
till
it
high
with
excessive
love
and
now
thought
he
how
long
must
i
remain
in
jeopardy
of
blank
amazements
that
amaze
no
more
now
i
have
tasted
her
sweet
soul
to
the
core
all
other
depths
are
shallow
essences
once
spiritual
are
like
muddy
lees
meant
but
to
fertilize
my
earthly
root
and
make
my
branches
lift
a
golden
fruit
into
the
bloom
of
heaven
other
light
though
it
be
quick
and
sharp
enough
to
blight
the
olympian
eagle
vision
is
dark
dark
as
the
parentage
of
chaos
hark
my
silent
thoughts
are
echoing
from
these
shells
or
they
are
but
the
ghosts
the
dying
swells
of
noises
far
away
list
hereupon
he
kept
an
anxious
ear
the
humming
tone
came
louder
and
behold
there
as
he
lay
on
either
side
outgush
with
misty
spray
a
copious
spring
and
both
together
swift
mad
fantastic
round
the
rocks
and
among
the
conchs
and
shells
of
the
lofty
grot
leaving
a
trickling
dew
at
last
they
shot
down
from
the
ceiling
height
pouring
a
noise
as
of
some
breathless
racers
whose
hopes
poize
upon
the
last
few
steps
and
with
spent
force
along
the
ground
they
took
a
winding
course
endymion
follow
for
it
seem
that
one
ever
pursued
the
other
strove
to
shun
follow
their
languid
mazes
till
well
nigh
he
had
left
thinking
of
the
mystery
and
was
now
rapt
in
tender
hoverings
over
the
vanish
bliss
ah
what
is
it
sings
his
dream
away
what
melodies
are
these
they
sound
as
through
the
whispering
of
trees
not
native
in
such
barren
vaults
give
ear
o
arethusa
peerless
nymph
why
fear
such
tenderness
as
mine
great
dian
why
why
didst
thou
hear
her
prayer
o
that
i
were
rippling
round
her
dainty
fairness
now
circling
about
her
waist
and
striving
how
to
entice
her
to
a
dive
then
stealing
in
between
her
luscious
lips
and
eyelids
thin
o
that
her
shining
hair
was
in
the
sun
and
i
distilling
from
it
thence
to
run
in
amorous
rillets
down
her
shrinking
form
to
linger
on
her
lily
shoulders
warm
between
her
kissing
breasts
and
every
charm
touch
raptur

how
painfully
i
flow
fair
maid

pitiful
to
my
great
woe

thy
weary
course
and
let
me
lead
a
happy
wooer
to
the
flowery
mead
where
all
that
beauty

stagnate
all
thy
fountains

i
really
got
such
power
to
madden
thee
and

very
thoughts
in

ever

heedlessly
did
lave
in
thy
deceitful
stream

strong
within
me
wherefore
serve
me
so
and
call

close
my

delight
thee
all
my

course
from

up
to
my

roam

he
heard
no

echo
faint
repeating
and
the
name
of
arethusa
on
the

of

dark
gulph
he
wept
and
said
i

thee
gentle

by
our
eternal
hopes
to
soothe
to
assuage
if
thou

suddenly

poor
cynthia
greeted
him
and
sooth
her
light
against
his
pallid
face
he
felt
the
charm
to
breathlessness
and
suddenly
a
warm
of
his
heart
blood
was
very
sweet
he
his
wandering
steps
and
laid
his
head
upon
a
tuft
of
straggling
weeds
to
taste
the
gentle
moon
and
freshening
beads
lashed
from
the
crystal
roof
by
fishes
tails
and
so
he
kept
until
the
rosy
veils
mantling
the
east
by
aurora
peering
hand
were
lifted
from
the
water
breast
and
into
sweet
air
and
sober
morning
came
meekly
through
billows
when
like
left
sudden
by
a
dallying
breath
of
air
he
rose
in
silence
and
once
more
fare
along
his
fated
way
far
had
he
roam
with
nothing
save
the
hollow
vast
that
above
around
and
at
his
feet
save
things
more
dead
than
morpheus
imaginings
old
rusted
anchors
helmets
large
of
gone
brazen
beaks
and
targe
rudders
that
for
a
hundred
years
had
lost
the
sway
of
human
hand
gold
vase
with
story
and
wherein
no
reveller
had
ever
dipp
a
chin
but
those
of
saturn
vintage
mouldering
scrolls
writ
in
the
tongue
of
heaven
by
those
souls
who
first
were
on
the
earth
and
sculptures
rude
in
ponderous
stone
developing
the
mood
of
ancient
nox
then
skeletons
of
man
of
beast
behemoth
and
leviathan
and
elephant
and
eagle
and
huge
jaw
of
nameless
monster
a
cold
leaden
awe
these
secrets
struck
into
him
and
unless
dian
had
chaced
away
that
heaviness
he
might
have
died
but
now
with
cheered
feel
he
onward
kept
wooing
these
thoughts
to
steal
about
the
labyrinth
in
his
soul
of
love
what
is
there
in
thee
moon
that
thou
shouldst
move
my
heart
so
potently
when
yet
a
child
i
oft
have
dried
my
tears
when
thou
hast
smil
thou
my
sister
hand
in
hand
we
went
from
eve
to
morn
across
the
firmament
no
apples
would
i
gather
from
the
tree
till
thou
hadst
cool
their
cheeks
deliciously
no
tumbling
water
ever
spake
romance
but
when
my
eyes
with
thine
thereon
could
dance
no
woods
were
green
enough
no
bower
divine
until
thou
liftedst
up
thine
eyelids
fine
in
sowing
time
would
i
dibble
take
or
drop
a
seed
till
thou
wast
wide
awake
and
in
the
summer
tide
of
blossoming
no
one
but
thee
hath
heard
me
blithly
sing
and
mesh
my
dewy
flowers
all
the
night
no
melody
was
like
a
passing
spright
if
it
went
not
to
solemnize
thy
reign
yes
in
my
boyhood
every
joy
and
pain
by
thee
were
fashion
to
the
end
and
as
i
grew
in
years
still
didst
thou
blend
with
all
my
ardours
thou
wast
the
deep
glen
thou
wast
the
the
sage
pen
the
poet
harp
the
voice
of
friends
the
sun
thou
wast
the
river
thou
wast
glory
won
thou
wast
my
clarion
blast
thou
wast
my
steed
my
goblet
full
of
wine
my
topmost
deed
thou
wast
the
charm
of
women
lovely
moon
o
what
a
wild
and
harmonized
tune
my
spirit
struck
from
all
the
beautiful
on
some
bright
essence
could
i
lean
and
lull
myself
to
immortality
i
prest
nature
soft
pillow
in
a
wakeful
rest
but
gentle
orb
there
came
a
nearer
bliss
my
strange
love
came
felicity
abyss
she
came
and
thou
didst
fade
and
fade
away
yet
not
entirely
no
thy
starry
sway
has
been
an
to
this
hour
now
i
begin
to
feel
thine
orby
power
is
coming
fresh
upon
me
o
be
kind
keep
back
thine
influence
and
do
not
blind
my
sovereign
dearest
love
forgive
that
i
can
think
away
from
thee
and
live
pardon
me
airy
planet
that
i
prize
one
thought
beyond
thine
argent
luxuries
how
far
beyond
at
this
a
surpris
start
frosted
the
springing
verdure
of
his
heart
for
as
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
swear
how
his
own
goddess
was
past
all
things
fair
he
saw
far
in
the
concave
green
of
the
sea
an
old
man
sitting
calm
and
peacefully
upon
a
weeded
rock
this
old
man
sat
and
his
white
hair
was
awful
and
a
mat
of
weeds
were
cold
beneath
his
cold
thin
feet
and
ample
as
the
largest
a
cloak
of
blue
wrapp
up
his
aged
bones
with
symbols
by
the
deepest
groans
of
ambitious
magic
every
was
woven
in
with
black
distinctness
storm
and
calm
and
whispering
and
hideous
roar
were
emblem
in
the
woof
with
every
shape
that
skims
or
dives
or
sleeps
cape
and
cape
the
gulphing
whale
was
like
a
dot
in
the
spell
yet
look
upon
it
and
size
and
swell
to
its
huge
self
and
the
minutest
fish
would
pass
the
very
hardest
gazer
wish
and
shew
his
little
eye
anatomy
then
there
was
pictur
the
regality
of
neptune
and
the
sea
nymphs
round
his
state
in
beauteous
vassalage
look
up
and
wait
beside
this
old
man
lay
a
pearly
wand
and
in
his
lap
a
book
the
which
he
so
stedfastly
that
the
new
denizen
had
time
to
keep
him
in
amazed
ken
to
mark
these
shadowings
and
stand
in
awe
the
old
man
rais
his
hoary
head
and
saw
the
wilder
stranger
seeming
not
to
see
his
features
were
so
lifeless
suddenly
he
woke
as
from
a
trance
his
brows
went
arching
up
and
like
two
magic
ploughs
furrow
deep
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
large
which
kept
as
fixedly
as
rocky
marge
till
round
his
wither
lips
had
gone
a
smile
then
up
he
rose
like
one
whose
tedious
toil
had
watch
for
years
in
forlorn
hermitage
who
had
not
from
to
utmost
age
eas
in
one
accent
his
soul
even
to
the
trees
he
rose
he
grasp
his
stole
with
convuls
clenches
waving
it
abroad
and
in
a
voice
of
solemn
joy
that
echo
into
oblivion
he
said
thou
art
the
man
now
shall
i
lay
my
head
in
peace
upon
my
watery
pillow
now
sleep
will
come
smoothly
to
my
weary
brow
o
jove
i
shall
be
young
again
be
young
o
neptune
i
am
pierc
and
stung
with
life
what
shall
i
do
where
go
when
i
have
cast
this
of
woe
i
swim
to
the
syrens
and
one
moment
listen
their
melodies
and
see
their
long
hair
glisten
anon
upon
that
giant
arm
i
be
that
writhes
about
the
roots
of
sicily
to
northern
seas
i
in
a
twinkling
sail
and
mount
upon
the
snortings
of
a
whale
to
some
black
cloud
thence
down
i
madly
sweep
on
forked
lightning
to
the
deepest
deep
where
through
some
sucking
pool
i
will
be
hurl
with
rapture
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
o
i
am
full
of
gladness
sisters
three
i
bow
full
hearted
to
your
old
decree
yes
every
god
be
thank
and
power
benign
for
i
no
more
shall
wither
droop
and
pine
thou
art
the
man
endymion
started
back
dismay
and
like
a
wretch
from
whom
the
rack
tortures
hot
breath
and
speech
of
agony
mutter
what
lonely
death
am
i
to
die
in
this
cold
region
will
he
let
me
freeze
and
float
my
brittle
limbs
polar
seas
or
will
he
touch
me
with
his
searing
hand
and
leave
a
black
memorial
on
the
sand
or
tear
me
with
a
bony
saw
and
keep
me
as
a
chosen
food
to
draw
his
magian
fish
through
hated
fire
and
flame
o
misery
of
hell
resistless
tame
am
i
to
be
burnt
up
no
i
will
shout
until
the
gods
through
heaven
blue
look
out
o
tartarus
but
some
few
days
agone
her
soft
arms
were
entwining
me
and
on
her
voice
i
hung
like
fruit
among
green
leaves
her
lips
were
all
my
own
and
ah
ripe
sheaves
of
happiness
ye
on
the
stubble
droop
but
never
may
be
garner
i
must
stoop
my
head
and
kiss
death
foot
love
love
farewel
is
there
no
hope
from
thee
this
horrid
spell
would
melt
at
thy
sweet
by
dian
hind
feeding
from
her
white
fingers
on
the
wind
i
see
thy
streaming
hair
and
now
by
pan
i
care
not
for
this
old
mysterious
man
he
spake
and
walking
to
that
aged
form
look
high
defiance
lo
his
heart
warm
with
pity
for
the
creature
wept
had
he
then
wrong
a
heart
where
sorrow
kept
had
he
though
blindly
contumelious
brought
rheum
to
kind
eyes
a
sting
to
human
thought
convulsion
to
a
mouth
of
many
years
he
had
in
truth
and
he
was
ripe
for
tears
the
penitent
shower
fell
as
down
he
knelt
before
that
sage
who
trembling
felt
about
his
large
dark
locks
and
faultering
spake
arise
good
youth
for
sacred
phœbus
sake
i
know
thine
inmost
bosom
and
i
feel
a
very
brother
yearning
for
thee
steal
into
mine
own
for
why
thou
openest
the
prison
gates
that
have
so
long
opprest
my
weary
watching
though
thou
it
not
thou
art
commission
to
this
fated
spot
for
great
enfranchisement
o
weep
no
more
i
am
a
friend
to
love
to
loves
of
yore
aye
hadst
thou
never
lov
an
unknown
power
i
had
been
grieving
at
this
joyous
hour
but
even
now
most
miserable
old
i
saw
thee
and
my
blood
no
longer
cold
gave
mighty
pulses
in
this
tottering
case
grew
a
new
heart
which
at
this
moment
plays
as
dancingly
as
thine
be
not
afraid
for
thou
shalt
hear
this
secret
all
display
now
as
we
speed
towards
our
joyous
task
so
saying
this
young
soul
in
age
mask
went
forward
with
the
carian
side
by
side
resuming
quickly
thus
while
ocean
tide
hung
swollen
at
their
backs
and
jewel
sands
took
silently
their
my
soul
stands
now
past
the
midway
from
mortality
and
so
i
can
prepare
without
a
sigh
to
tell
thee
briefly
all
my
joy
and
pain
i
was
a
fisher
once
upon
this
main
and
my
boat
danc
in
every
creek
and
bay
rough
billows
were
my
home
by
night
and
day
the
not
more
constant
for
i
had
no
housing
from
the
storm
and
tempests
mad
but
hollow
rocks
and
they
were
palaces
of
silent
happiness
of
slumberous
ease
long
years
of
misery
have
told
me
so
aye
thus
it
was
one
thousand
years
ago
one
thousand
years
is
it
then
possible
to
look
so
plainly
through
them
to
dispel
a
thousand
years
with
backward
glance
sublime
to
breathe
away
as
all
scummy
slime
from
off
a
crystal
pool
to
see
its
deep
and
one
own
image
from
the
bottom
peep
yes
now
i
am
no
longer
wretched
thrall
my
long
captivity
and
moanings
all
are
but
a
slime
a
scum
the
which
i
breathe
away
and
thronging
come
like
things
of
yesterday
my
youthful
pleasures
i
touch
no
lute
i
sang
not
trod
no
measures
i
was
a
lonely
youth
on
desert
shores
my
sports
were
lonely
continuous
roars
and
craggy
isles
and
plaintive
cry
plaining
discrepant
between
sea
and
sky
dolphins
were
still
my
playmates
shapes
unseen
would
let
me
feel
their
scales
of
gold
and
green
nor
be
my
desolation
and
full
oft
when
a
dread
waterspout
had
rear
aloft
its
hungry
hugeness
seeming
ready
ripe
to
burst
with
hoarsest
thunderings
and
wipe
my
life
away
like
a
vast
sponge
of
fate
some
friendly
monster
pitying
my
sad
state
has
dived
to
its
foundations
gulph
it
down
and
left
me
tossing
safely
but
the
crown
of
all
my
life
was
utmost
quietude
more
did
i
love
to
lie
in
cavern
rude
keeping
in
wait
whole
days
for
neptune
voice
and
if
it
came
at
last
hark
and
rejoice
there
blush
no
summer
eve
but
i
would
steer
my
skiff
along
green
shelving
coasts
to
hear
the
shepherd
pipe
come
clear
from
aery
steep
mingled
with
ceaseless
bleatings
of
his
sheep
and
never
was
a
day
of
summer
shine
but
i
beheld
its
birth
upon
the
brine
for
i
would
watch
all
night
to
see
unfold
heaven
gates
and
æthon
snort
his
morning
gold
wide
the
swelling
streams
and
constantly
at
brim
of
on
some
grassy
lea
my
nets
would
be
spread
out
and
i
at
rest
the
poor
folk
of
the
i
blest
with
daily
boon
of
fish
most
delicate
they
knew
not
whence
this
bounty
and
elate
would
strew
sweet
flowers
on
a
sterile
beach
why
was
i
not
contented
wherefore
reach
at
things
which
but
for
thee
o
latmian
had
been
my
dreary
death
fool
i
began
to
feel
distemper
longings
to
desire
the
utmost
privilege
that
ocean
sire
could
grant
in
benediction
to
be
free
of
all
his
kingdom
long
in
misery
i
wasted
ere
in
one
extremest
fit
i
plung
for
life
or
death
to
interknit
one
senses
with
so
dense
a
breathing
stuff
might
seem
a
work
of
pain
so
not
enough
can
i
admire
how
it
felt
and
buoyant
round
my
limbs
at
first
i
dwelt
whole
days
and
days
in
sheer
astonishment
forgetful
utterly
of
moving
but
with
the
mighty
ebb
and
flow
then
like
a
new
fledg
bird
that
first
doth
shew
his
spreaded
feathers
to
the
morrow
chill
i
tried
in
fear
the
pinions
of
my
will
was
freedom
and
at
once
i
visited
the
ceaseless
wonders
of
this
no
need
to
tell
thee
of
them
for
i
see
that
thou
hast
been
a
witness
it
must
be
for
these
i
know
thou
canst
not
feel
a
drouth
by
the
melancholy
corners
of
that
mouth
so
i
will
in
my
story
straightway
pass
to
more
immediate
matter
woe
alas
that
love
should
be
my
bane
ah
scylla
fair
why
did
poor
glaucus
ever
ever
dare
to
sue
thee
to
his
heart
kind
i
lov
her
to
the
very
white
of
truth
and
she
would
not
conceive
it
timid
thing
she
fled
me
swift
as
on
the
wing
round
every
isle
and
point
and
promontory
from
where
large
hercules
wound
up
his
story
far
as
egyptian
nile
my
passion
grew
the
more
the
more
i
saw
her
dainty
hue
gleam
delicately
through
the
azure
clear
until
was
too
fierce
agony
to
bear
and
in
that
agony
across
my
grief
it
flash
that
circe
might
find
some
relief
cruel
enchantress
so
above
the
water
i
rear
my
head
and
look
for
phœbus
daughter
ææa
isle
was
wondering
at
the
moon
it
seem
to
whirl
around
me
and
a
swoon
left
me
to
that
fatal
power
when
i
awoke
was
in
a
twilight
bower
just
when
the
light
of
morn
with
hum
of
bees
stole
through
its
verdurous
matting
of
fresh
trees
how
sweet
and
sweeter
for
i
heard
a
lyre
and
over
it
a
sighing
voice
expire
it
ceased
i
caught
light
footsteps
and
anon
the
fairest
face
that
morn
look
upon
push
through
a
screen
of
roses
starry
jove
with
tears
and
smiles
and
she
wove
a
net
whose
thraldom
was
more
bliss
than
all
the
range
of
flower
elysium
thus
did
fall
the
dew
of
her
rich
speech
ah
art
awake
o
let
me
hear
thee
speak
for
cupid
sake
i
am
so
oppress
with
joy
why
i
have
shed
an
urn
of
tears
as
though
thou
wert
cold
dead
and
now
i
find
thee
living
i
will
pour
from
these
devoted
eyes
their
silver
store
until
exhausted
of
the
latest
drop
so
it
will
pleasure
thee
and
force
thee
stop
here
that
i
too
may
live
but
if
beyond
such
cool
and
sorrowful
offerings
thou
art
fond
of
soothing
warmth
of
dalliance
supreme
if
thou
art
ripe
to
taste
a
long
love
dream
if
smiles
if
dimples
tongues
for
ardour
mute
hang
in
thy
vision
like
a
tempting
fruit
o
let
me
pluck
it
for
thee
thus
she
her
charming
syllables
till
indistinct
their
music
came
to
my
soul
and
then
she
hover
over
me
and
stole
so
near
that
if
no
nearer
it
had
been
this
furrow
visage
thou
hadst
never
seen
young
man
of
latmos
thus
particular
am
i
that
thou
plainly
see
how
far
this
fierce
temptation
went
and
thou
not
exclaim
how
then
was
scylla
quite
forgot
who
could
resist
who
in
this
universe
she
did
so
breathe
ambrosia
so
immerse
my
fine
existence
in
a
golden
clime
she
took
me
like
a
child
of
suckling
time
and
cradled
me
in
roses
thus
condemn
the
current
of
my
former
life
was
stemm
and
to
this
arbitrary
queen
of
sense
i
bow
a
tranced
vassal
nor
would
thence
have
mov
even
though
amphion
harp
had
me
back
to
scylla
the
billows
rude
for
as
apollo
each
eve
doth
devise
a
new
appareling
for
western
skies
so
every
eve
nay
every
spendthrift
hour
shed
balmy
consciousness
within
that
bower
and
i
was
free
of
haunts
umbrageous
could
wander
in
the
mazy
of
squirrels
foxes
shy
and
antler
deer
and
birds
from
coverts
innermost
and
drear
warbling
for
very
joy
mellifluous
sorrow
to
me
new
born
delights
now
let
me
borrow
for
moments
few
a
temperament
as
stern
as
pluto
sceptre
that
my
words
not
burn
these
uttering
lips
while
i
in
calm
speech
tell
how
specious
heaven
was
changed
to
real
hell
one
morn
she
left
me
sleeping
half
awake
i
sought
for
her
smooth
arms
and
lips
to
slake
my
greedy
thirst
with
nectarous
but
she
was
gone
whereat
the
barbed
shafts
of
disappointment
stuck
in
me
so
sore
that
out
i
ran
and
search
the
forest
wandering
about
in
pine
and
cedar
gloom
damp
awe
assail
me
for
there
to
boom
a
sound
of
moan
an
agony
of
sound
sepulchral
from
the
distance
all
around
then
came
a
conquering
and
rumbled
that
fierce
complain
to
silence
while
i
stumbled
down
a
precipitous
path
as
if
impell
i
came
to
a
dark
groanings
poisonous
about
my
ears
and
louder
grew
the
nearer
i
approach
a
flame
gaunt
blue
that
glar
before
me
through
a
thorny
brake
this
fire
like
the
eye
of
gordian
snake
bewitch
me
towards
and
i
soon
was
near
a
sight
too
fearful
for
the
feel
of
fear
in
thicket
hid
i
curs
the
haggard
scene
the
banquet
of
my
arms
my
arbour
queen
seated
upon
an
uptorn
forest
root
and
all
around
her
shapes
wizard
and
brute
laughing
and
wailing
groveling
serpenting
shewing
tooth
tusk
and
and
sting
o
such
deformities
old
charon
self
should
he
give
up
awhile
his
penny
pelf
and
take
a
dream
rushes
stygian
it
could
not
be
so
phantasied
fierce
wan
and
tyrannizing
was
the
lady
look
as
over
them
a
gnarled
staff
she
shook
upon
the
sudden
she
laugh
out
and
from
a
basket
emptied
to
the
rout
clusters
of
grapes
the
which
they
raven
quick
and
roar
for
more
with
many
a
hungry
lick
about
their
shaggy
jaws
avenging
slow
anon
she
took
a
branch
of
mistletoe
and
emptied
o
a
black
phial
groan
one
and
all
as
if
some
piercing
trial
was
sharpening
for
their
pitiable
bones
she
lifted
up
the
charm
appealing
groans
from
their
poor
breasts
went
sueing
to
her
ear
in
vain
remorseless
as
an
infant
bier
she
whisk
against
their
eyes
the
sooty
oil
whereat
was
heard
a
noise
of
painful
toil
increasing
gradual
to
a
tempest
rage
shrieks
yells
and
groans
of
until
their
grieved
bodies
to
bloat
and
puff
from
the
tail
end
to
stifled
throat
then
was
appalling
silence
then
a
sight
more
wildering
than
all
that
hoarse
affright
for
the
whole
herd
as
by
a
whirlwind
writhen
went
through
the
dismal
air
like
one
huge
python
antagonizing
boreas
and
so
vanish
yet
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
she
these
phantoms
with
a
nod
lo
from
the
dark
came
waggish
fauns
and
nymphs
and
satyrs
stark
with
dancing
and
loud
revelry
and
went
swifter
than
centaurs
after
rapine
sighing
an
elephant
appear
and
bow
before
the
fierce
witch
speaking
thus
aloud
in
human
accent
potent
goddess
chief
of
pains
resistless
make
my
being
brief
or
let
me
from
this
heavy
prison
fly
or
give
me
to
the
air
or
let
me
die
i
sue
not
for
my
happy
crown
again
i
sue
not
for
my
phalanx
on
the
plain
i
sue
not
for
my
lone
my
widow
wife
i
sue
not
for
my
ruddy
drops
of
life
my
children
fair
my
lovely
girls
and
boys
i
will
forget
them
i
will
pass
these
joys
ask
nought
so
heavenward
so
too
too
high
only
i
pray
as
fairest
boon
to
die
or
be
deliver
from
this
cumbrous
flesh
from
this
gross
detestable
filthy
mesh
and
merely
given
to
the
cold
bleak
air
have
mercy
goddess
circe
feel
my
prayer
that
curst
magician
name
fell
icy
numb
upon
my
wild
conjecturing
truth
had
come
naked
and
against
my
heart
i
saw
a
fury
whetting
a
and
my
slain
spirit
overwrought
with
fright
fainted
away
in
that
dark
lair
of
night
think
my
deliverer
how
desolate
my
waking
must
have
been
disgust
and
hate
and
terrors
manifold
divided
me
a
spoil
amongst
them
i
prepar
to
flee
into
the
dungeon
core
of
that
wild
wood
i
fled
three
days
when
lo
before
me
stood
glaring
the
angry
witch
o
dis
even
now
a
clammy
dew
is
beading
on
my
brow
at
mere
remembering
her
pale
laugh
and
curse
ha
ha
sir
dainty
there
must
be
a
nurse
made
of
rose
leaves
and
thistledown
express
to
cradle
thee
my
sweet
and
lull
thee
yes
i
am
too
for
thy
nice
touch
my
tenderest
squeeze
is
but
a
giant
clutch
so
it
shall
have
lullabies
unheard
of
yet
and
it
shall
still
its
cries
upon
some
breast
more
oh
no
it
shall
not
pine
and
pine
and
pine
more
than
one
pretty
trifling
thousand
years
and
then
pity
but
fate
gentle
shears
cut
short
its
immortality
young
dove
of
the
waters
truly
i
not
hurt
one
hair
of
thine
see
how
i
weep
and
sigh
that
our
parting
is
so
nigh
and
must
we
part
ah
yes
it
must
be
so
yet
ere
thou
leavest
me
in
utter
woe
let
me
sob
over
thee
my
last
adieus
and
speak
a
blessing
mark
me
thou
hast
thews
immortal
for
thou
art
of
heavenly
race
but
such
a
love
is
mine
that
here
i
chase
eternally
away
from
thee
all
bloom
of
youth
and
destine
thee
towards
a
tomb
hence
shalt
thou
quickly
to
the
watery
vast
and
there
ere
many
days
be
overpast
disabled
age
shall
seize
thee
and
even
then
thou
shalt
not
go
the
way
of
aged
men
but
live
and
wither
cripple
and
still
breathe
ten
hundred
years
which
gone
i
then
bequeath
thy
fragile
bones
to
unknown
burial
adieu
sweet
love
adieu
as
shot
stars
fall
she
fled
ere
i
could
groan
for
mercy
stung
and
poisoned
was
my
spirit
despair
sung
a
of
defiance
all
hell
a
hand
was
at
my
shoulder
to
compel
my
sullen
steps
another
my
eyes
moved
on
with
pointed
finger
in
this
guise
enforced
at
the
last
by
ocean
foam
i
found
me
by
my
fresh
my
native
home
its
tempering
coolness
to
my
life
akin
came
salutary
as
i
waded
in
and
with
a
blind
voluptuous
rage
i
gave
battle
to
the
swollen
and
drave
large
froth
before
me
while
there
yet
hale
strength
nor
from
my
bones
all
marrow
drain
young
lover
i
must
weep
such
hellish
spite
with
dry
cheek
who
can
tell

thus
my

proving
upon
this
element
dismay
upon
a

my

was
scylla
cursed
cursed
circe
o
hast
never

of
mercy
could
not
thy
harshest
vengeance
be
content
but
thou
must
nip
this
tender
innocent
because
i
lov
her
cold
o
cold
indeed
were
her
fair
limbs
and
like
a
common
weed
the
took
her
hair
dead
as
she
was
i
clung
about
her
waist
nor
ceas
to
pass
fleet
as
an
arrow
through
unfathom
brine
until
there
shone
a
fabric
crystalline
ribb
and
inlaid
with
coral
pebble
and
pearl
headlong
i
darted
at
one
eager
swirl
gain
its
bright
portal
enter
and
behold
was
vast
and
desolate
and
and
all
around
but
wherefore
this
to
thee
who
in
few
minutes
more
thyself
shalt
see
i
left
poor
scylla
in
a
niche
and
fled
my
fever
parchings
up
my
scathing
dread
met
palsy
half
way
soon
these
limbs
became
gaunt
wither
sapless
feeble
cramp
and
lame
now
let
me
pass
a
cruel
cruel
space
without
one
hope
without
one
faintest
trace
of
mitigation
or
redeeming
bubble
of
colour
phantasy
for
i
fear
trouble
thy
brain
to
loss
of
reason
and
next
tell
how
a
restoring
chance
came
down
to
quell
one
half
of
the
witch
in
me
on
a
day
sitting
upon
a
rock
above
the
spray
i
saw
grow
up
from
the
horizon
brink
a
gallant
vessel
soon
she
seem
to
sink
away
from
me
again
as
though
her
course
had
been
resum
in
spite
of
hindering
force
so
vanish
and
not
long
before
arose
dark
clouds
and
muttering
of
winds
morose
old
eolus
would
stifle
his
mad
spleen
but
could
not
therefore
all
the
billows
green
toss
up
the
silver
spume
against
the
clouds
the
tempest
came
i
saw
that
vessel
shrouds
in
perilous
bustle
while
upon
the
deck
stood
trembling
creatures
i
beheld
the
wreck
the
final
gulphing
the
poor
struggling
souls
i
heard
their
cries
amid
loud
o
they
had
all
been
sav
but
crazed
eld
annull
my
vigorous
cravings
and
thus
and
curb
think
o
o
latmian
did
i
sit
writhing
with
pity
and
a
cursing
fit
against
that
circe
the
crew
had
gone
by
one
and
one
to
pale
oblivion
and
i
was
gazing
on
the
surges
prone
with
many
a
scalding
tear
and
many
a
groan
when
at
my
feet
emerg
an
old
man
hand
grasping
this
scroll
and
this
same
slender
wand
i
knelt
with
pain
reached
out
my
hand
had
these
treasures
touch
the
knuckles
they
unclasp
i
caught
a
finger
but
the
downward
weight
me
it
sank
then
abate
the
storm
and
through
chill
aguish
gloom
outburst
the
comfortable
sun
i
was
athirst
to
search
the
book
and
in
the
warming
air
parted
its
dripping
leaves
with
eager
care
strange
matters
did
it
treat
of
and
drew
on
my
soul
page
after
page
till
won
into
forgetfulness
when
stupefied
i
read
these
words
and
read
again
and
tried
my
eyes
against
the
heavens
and
read
again
o
what
a
load
of
misery
and
pain
each
bore
off
a
shine
of
hope
came
gold
around
me
cheering
me
to
cope
strenuous
with
hellish
tyranny
attend
for
thou
hast
brought
their
promise
to
an
end
the
wide
sea
there
lives
a
forlorn
wretch
doom
with
enfeebled
carcase
to
outstretch
his
loath
existence
through
ten
centuries
and
then
to
die
alone
who
can
devise
a
total
opposition
no
one
so
one
million
times
ocean
must
ebb
and
flow
and
he
oppressed
yet
he
shall
not
die
these
things
accomplish
if
he
all
the
depths
of
magic
and
expounds
the
meanings
of
all
motions
shapes
and
sounds
if
he
explores
all
forms
and
substances
straight
homeward
to
their
he
shall
not
die
moreover
and
in
chief
must
pursue
this
task
of
joy
and
grief
most
piously
all
lovers
and
in
the
savage
overwhelming
lost
he
shall
deposit
side
by
side
until
time
creeping
shall
the
dreary
space
fulfil
done
and
all
these
labours
ripened
a
youth
by
heavenly
power
lov
and
led
shall
stand
before
him
whom
he
shall
direct
how
to
consummate
all
the
youth
elect
must
do
the
thing
or
both
will
be
then
cried
the
young
endymion
overjoy
we
are
twin
brothers
in
this
destiny
say
i
intreat
thee
what
achievement
high
is
in
this
restless
world
for
me
reserv
what
if
from
thee
my
wandering
feet
had
swerv

we
both
perish
look
the
sage
replied
dost
thou

a
gleaming
through
the
tide
of
divers
brilliances

the
edifice
i
told
thee
of
where
lovely
scylla
lies
and
where
i
have
enshrined
piously
all
lovers
whom
fell
storms
have
doom
to
die
throughout
my
bondage
thus
discoursing
on
they
went
till
unobscur
the
porches
shone
which
hurryingly
they
gain
and
enter
straight
sure
never
since
king
neptune
held
his
state
was
seen
such
wonder
underneath
the
stars
turn
to
some
level
plain
where
haughty
mars
has
legion
all
his
battle
and
behold
how
every
soldier
with
firm
foot
doth
hold
his
even
breast
see
many
steeled
squares
and
rigid
ranks
of
iron
whence
who
dares
one
step
imagine
further
line
by
line
these
warrior
thousands
on
the
field
supine
so
in
that
crystal
place
in
silent
rows
poor
lovers
lay
at
rest
from
joys
and
the
stranger
from
the
mountains
breathless
such
thousands
of
shut
eyes
in
order
plac
such
ranges
of
white
feet
and
patient
lips
all
ruddy
for
here
death
no
blossom

he
mark
their
brows
and
foreheads
saw
their
hair
put
sleekly
on
one
side
with
nicest
care
and
each
one
gentle
wrists
with
reverence
put
to
its
heart
let
us
commence

the
guide
stuttering
with
joy
even
now
he
spake
and
trembling
like
an
began
to
tear
his
scroll
in
pieces
small
uttering
the
while
some
mumblings
funeral
he
tore
it
into
pieces
small
as
snow
that
drifts
unfeather
when
bleak
northerns
blow
and
having
done
it
took
his
dark
blue
cloak
and
bound
it
round
endymion
then
struck
his
wand
against
the
empty
air
times
what
more
there
is
to
do
young
man
is
thine
but
first
a
little
patience
first
undo
this
tangled
thread
and
wind
it
to
a
clue
ah
gentle
is
as
weak
as
spider
skein
and
shouldst
thou
break
it
what
is
it
done
so
clean
a
power
overshadows
thee
oh
brave
the
spite
of
hell
is
tumbling
to
its
grave
here
is
a
shell
is
pearly
blank
to
me
nor

with
any
sign
or
charactery
canst
thou
read
aught
o

for
pity
sake

are
safe
now

break
this
wand
against
yon
lyre
on
the
pedestal
was
done
and
straight
with
sudden
swell
and
fall
sweet
music
breath
her
soul
away
and
a
lullaby
to
youth
now
strew
these
minced
leaves
on
me
and
passing
through
those
files
of
dead
scatter
the
same
around
and
thou
wilt
see
the
issue
the
sound
of
flutes
and
viols
ravishing
his
heart
endymion
from
glaucus
stood
apart
and
scatter
in
his
face
some
fragments
light
how
the
change
a
youthful
wight
smiling
beneath
a
coral
diadem
sudden
like
an
upturn
gem
appear
and
stepping
to
a
beauteous
corse
kneel
down
beside
it
and
with
tenderest
force
press
its
cold
hand
and
wept
and
scylla
sigh
endymion
with
quick
hand
the
charm
applied
the
nymph
arose
he
left
them
to
their
joy
and
onward
went
upon
his
high
employ
showering
those
powerful
fragments
on
the
dead
and
as
he
pass
each
lifted
up
its
head
as
doth
a
flower
at
apollo
touch
death
felt
it
to
his
inwards
was
too
much
death
fell
a
weeping
in
his
the
latmian
persever
along
and
thus
all
were
there
arose
a
noise
of
harmony
pulses
and
throes
of
gladness
in
the
air
while
many
who
had
died
in
mutual
arms
devout
and
true
sprang
to
each
other
madly
and
the
rest
felt
a
high
certainty
of
being
blest
they
gaz
upon
endymion
enchantment
grew
drunken
and
would
have
its
head
and
bent
delicious
symphonies
like
airy
flowers
budded
and
swell
and
shed
full
showers
of
light
soft
unseen
leaves
of
sounds
divine
the
two
deliverers
tasted
a
pure
wine
of
happiness
from
ooz
out
speechless
they
eyed
each
other
and
about
the
fair
assembly
wander
to
and
fro
distracted
with
the
richest
overflow
of
joy
that
ever
pour
from
heaven
away
shouted
the
new
born
god
follow
and
pay
our
piety
to
neptunus
supreme
then
scylla
blushing
sweetly
from
her
dream
they
led
on
first
bent
to
her
meek
surprise
though
portal
columns
of
a
giant
size
into
the
vaulted
boundless
emerald
joyous
all
follow
as
the
leader
call
down
marble
steps
pouring
as
easily
as
sand
and
fast
as
you
might
see
swallows
obeying
the
south
summer
call
or
swans
upon
a
gentle
waterfall
thus
went
that
beautiful
multitude
nor
far
ere
from
among
some
rocks
of
glittering
spar
just
within
ken
they
saw
descending
thick
another
multitude
whereat
more
quick
moved
either
host
on
a
wide
sand
they
met
and
of
those
numbers
every
eye
was
wet
for
each
their
old
love
found
a
murmuring
rose
like
what

god
neptune
palaces
with
noise
increas
they
shoulder
on
towards
that
brightening
cast
at
every
onward
step
proud
domes
arose
in
prospect
diamond
gleams
and
golden
glows
of
amber
their
faces
levelling
joyous
and
many
as

in

still
onward
still
the

gradual

rich

domes
were
seen
on

upheld
by
jasper
pillars
letting
through
their
shafts
a
blush
of
coral
copious
each
gazer
drank
and
deeper
drank
more
near
for
what
poor

fragment
up
as
mere
as
marble
was
there
lavish
to
the
vast
of
one
fair
palace
that
far
far
surpass
even
for
common
bulk
those
olden
three
memphis
and
babylon
and
nineveh
as
large
as
bright
as

as
the

of

when
unfading
it
doth
shew
beyond
a
silvery
shower
was
the
arch
through
which
this
paphian
army
took
its
march
into
the
outer
courts
of
neptune
state
whence
could
be
seen
direct
a
golden
gate
to
which
the
leaders
sped
but
not
half
raught
ere
it
burst
open
swift
as
fairy
thought
and
made
those
dazzled
thousands
veil
their
eyes
like
callow
eagles
at
the
first
sunrise
soon
with
an
eagle
nativeness
their
gaze
ripe
from
swoons
took
all
the
blaze
and
then
behold
large
neptune
on
his
throne
of
emerald
deep
yet
not
exalt
alone
at
his
right
hand
stood
winged
love
and
on
his
left
sat
smiling
beauty
paragon
far
as
the
mariner
on
highest
mast
can
see
all
round
upon
the
calmed
vast
so
wide
was
neptune
hall
and
as
the
blue
doth
vault
the
waters
so
the
waters
drew
their
doming
curtains
high
magnificent
aw
from
the
throne
aloof
and
when
disclos
the

air
but
sooth
as
now
flash
sudden
everywhere
noiseless
cloudlets
glittering
death
to
a
human
eye
for
there
did
spring
from
natural
west
and
east
and
south
and
north
a
light
as
of
four
sunsets
blazing
forth
a
zenith
the
head
of
lucid
depth
the
floor
and
far
outspread
as
breezeless
lake
on
which
the
slim
canoe
of

indian
darts
about
as
through
the
delicatest
air
air
verily
but
for
the

of

this

but
for
the
amaze
of
wonders
motionless
and
blaze
of
the
dome
pomp
reflected
in
extremes
globing
a
golden
sphere
they
stood
in

till

blew
his
horn
the
palace
rang
the
nereids
danc
the
syrens
faintly
sang
and
the
great
bow
his
dripping
head
then
love
took
wing
and
from
his
pinions
shed
on
all
the
multitude
a
nectarous
dew
the
goddess
beckoned
and
drew
fair
scylla
and
her
guides
to
conference
and
when
they
reach
the
throned
eminence
she
kist
the

who
sat

down

said
thy

were

behold
two
copious
instant
fell
from
the
god
large
eyes
he
smil
delectable
and
over
glaucus
held
his
blessing
endymion
ah
still
wandering
in
the
bands
of
love
now
this
is
cruel
since
the
hour
i
met
thee
in
earth
bosom
all
my
power
have
i
put
forth
to
serve
thee
what
not
yet
escap
from
dull
mortality
harsh
net
a
little
patience
youth
not
be
long
or
i
am
skilless
quite
an
idle
tongue
a
humid
eye
and
steps
luxurious
where
these
are
new
and
strange
are
ominous
aye
i
have
seen
these
signs
in
one
of
heaven
when
others
were
all
blind
and
were
i
given
to
utter
secrets
haply
i
might
say
some
pleasant
words
but
love
will
have
his
day
so
wait
awhile
expectant
soon
even
in
the
passing
of
thine
visit
my
cytherea
thou
wilt
find
cupid
my
adonis
kind
and
pray
persuade
with
thee
ah
i
have
done
all
blisses
be
upon
thee
my
sweet
son
thus
the
fair
goddess
while
endymion
knelt
to
receive
those
accents
halcyon
meantime
a
glorious
revelry
began
before
the
nectar
ran
in
courteous
fountains
to
all
cups
outreach
and
plunder
vines
teeming
exhaustless
new
growth
about
each
shell
and
pendent
lyre
the
which
in
disentangling
for
their
fire
pull
down
fresh
foliage
and
coverture
for
dainty
toying
cupid
flutter
and
laugh
and
through
the
throng
made
a
delighted
way
then
dance
and
song
and
garlanding
grew
wild
and
pleasure
reign
in
harmless
tendril
they
each
other
chain
and
strove
who
should
be
smother
deepest
in
fresh
crush
of
leaves
o
is
a
very
sin
for
one
so
weak
to
venture
his
poor
verse
in
such
a
place
as
this
o
do
not
curse
high
muses
let
him
hurry
to
the
ending
all
suddenly
were
silent
a
soft
blending
of
dulcet
instruments
came
charmingly
and
then
a
hymn
king
of
the
stormy
sea
brother
of
jove
and
of
elements
eternally
before
thee
the
waves
awful
bow
fast
stubborn
rock
at
thy
fear
trident
shrinking
doth
unlock
its
deep
foundations
hissing
into
foam
all
lost
in
the
wide
home
of
thy
capacious
bosom
ever
flow
thou
frownest
and
old
eolus
thy
foe
skulks
to
his
cavern
the
gruff
complaint
of
all
his
rebel
tempests
dark
clouds
faint
when
from
thy
diadem
a
silver
gleam
slants
over
blue
dominion
thy
bright
team
gulphs
in
the
morning
light
and
scuds
along
to
bring
thee
nearer
to
that
golden
song
apollo
singeth
while
his
chariot
waits
at
the
doors
of
heaven
thou
art
not
for
scenes
like
this
an
empire
stern
hast
thou
and
it
hath
furrow
that
large
front
yet
now
as
newly
come
of
heaven
dost
thou
sit
to
blend
and
interknit
subdued
majesty
with
this
glad
time
o
king
sublime
we
lay
our
hearts
before
thee
evermore
we
sing
and
we
adore
breathe
softly

be
tender
of
your
strings
ye
soothing
lutes
nor
be
the
trumpet
heard
o

o

not

budding
in
an
april
rain
nor
breath
of
sleeping
dove
nor

flow
no
nor
the
eolian
twang
of

own

can
mingle
music
fit
for
the
soft
ear
of
goddess
cytherea
yet
deign
white
queen
of
beauty
thy
fair
eyes
on
our
souls
sacrifice
child
who
has
another
care
when
thou
hast
smil
unfortunates
on
earth
we
see
at
last
all
and
glooms
that
overcast
our
spirits
fann
away
by
thy

o

we
quaff
until

and
by

was
heard
no
more
for
clamour
when
the
golden
palace
door
opened
again
and
from
without
in
shone
a
new
magnificence
on
oozy
throne
came
oceanus
the
old
to
take
a
latest
glimpse
at
his
before
he
went
into
his
quiet
cave
to
muse
for
ever
then
a
lucid
wave
scoop
from
its
trembling
sisters
of
afloat
and
pillowing
up
the
majesty
of
doris
and
the
egean
seer
her
spouse
next
on
a
dolphin
clad
in
laurel
boughs
theban
amphion
leaning
on
his
lute
his
fingers
went
across
it
all
were
mute
to
gaze
on
amphitrite
queen
of
pearls
and
thetis
pearly
the
palace
whirls
around
giddy
endymion
seeing
he
was
there
far
strayed
from
mortality
he
could
not
bear
it
shut
his
eyes
in
vain
imagination
gave
a
dizzier
pain
o
i
shall
die
sweet
venus
be
my
stay
where
is
my
lovely
mistress
i
die
i
hear
her
voice
i
feel
my
wing
at
neptune
feet
he
sank
a
sudden
ring
of
nereids
were
about
him
in
kind
strife
to
usher
back
his
spirit
into
life
but
still
he
slept
at
last
they
interwove
their
cradling
arms
and
purpos
to
convey
towards
a
crystal
bower
far
away
lo
while
slow
carried
through
the
pitying
crowd
to
his
inward
senses
these
words
spake
aloud
written
in
on
the
dark
above
endymion
my
entire
love
how
have
i
dwelt
in
fear
of
fate
is
done
immortal
bliss
for
me
too
hast
thou
then
for
the
shall
not
hatch
her
ready
eggs
before
i
kissing
snatch
thee
into
endless
heaven
awake
awake
the
youth
at
once
arose
a
placid
lake
came
quiet
to
his
eyes
and
forest
green
cooler
than
all
the
wonders
he
had
seen
lull
with
its
simple
song
his
fluttering
breast
how
happy
once
again
in
grassy
nest
endymion
book
iv
muse
of
my
native
land
loftiest
muse
o
on
the
mountains
by
the
hues
of
heaven
on
the
spiritual
air
begot
long
didst
thou
sit
alone
in
northern
grot
while
yet
our
england
was
a
wolfish
den
before
our
forests
heard
the
talk
of
men
before
the
first
of
druids
was
a
child
long
didst
thou
sit
amid
our
regions
wild
rapt
in
a
deep
prophetic
solitude
there
came
an
eastern
voice
of
solemn
mood
yet
wast
thou
patient
then
sang
forth
the
nine
apollo
garland
yet
didst
thou
divine
such
glory
that
they
cry
in
vain
come
hither
sister
of
the
island
plain
spake
fair
ausonia
and
once
more
she
spake
a
higher
summons
still
didst
thou
betake
thee
to
thy
native
hopes
o
thou
hast
won
a
full
accomplishment
the
thing
is
done
which
undone
these
our
latter
days
had
risen
on
barren
souls
great
muse
thou
what
prison
of
flesh
and
bone
curbs
and
confines
and
frets
our
spirit
wings
despondency
besets
our
pillows
and
the
fresh
morn
seems
to
give
forth
its
light
in
very
scorn
of
our
dull
uninspired
lives
long
have
i
said
how
happy
he
who
shrives
to
thee
but
then
i
thought
on
poets
gone
and
could
not
pray
nor
can
i
now
so
on
i
move
to
the
end
in
lowliness
of
ah
woe
is
me
that
i
should
fondly
part
from
my
dear
native
land
ah
foolish
maid
glad
was
the
hour
when
with
thee
myriads
bade
adieu
to
ganges
and
their
pleasant
fields
to
one
so
friendless
the
clear
freshet
yields
a
bitter
coolness
the
ripe
grape
is
sour
yet
i
would
have
great
gods
but
one
short
hour
of
native
air
let
me
but
die
at
home
endymion
to
heaven
airy
dome
was
offering
up
a
hecatomb
of
vows
when
these
words
reach
him
whereupon
he
bows
his
head
through
entanglement
of
underwood
and
to
the
sound
is
bent
anxious
as
hind
towards
her
hidden
fawn
is
no
one
near
to
help
me
no
fair
dawn
of
life
from
charitable
voice
no
sweet
saying
to
set
my
dull
and
sadden
spirit
playing
no
hand
to
toy
with
mine
no
lips
so
sweet
that
i
may
worship
them
no
eyelids
meet
to
twinkle
on
my
bosom
no
one
dies
before
me
till
from
these
enslaving
eyes
redemption
sparkles
i
am
sad
and
lost
thou
carian
lord
hadst
better
have
been
tost
into
a
whirlpool
vanish
into
air
warm
mountaineer
for
canst
thou
only
bear
a
woman
sigh
alone
and
in
distress
see
not
her
charms
is
phœbe
passionless
phœbe
is
fairer
far
o
gaze
no
more
yet
if
thou
wilt
behold
all
beauty

behold
her
panting
in
the
forest
grass
do
not
those
curls
of
glossy
jet
surpass
for
tenderness
the
arms
so
idly
lain
amongst
them
feelest
not
a
kindred
pain
to
see
such
lovely
eyes
in
swimming
search
after
some
warm
delight
that
seems
to
perch
dovelike
in
the
dim
cell
lying
beyond
their
upper
lids
hist
o
for
hermes
wand
to
touch
this
flower
into
human
shape
that
woodland
hyacinthus
could
escape
from
his
green
prison
and
here
kneeling
down
call
me
his
queen
his
second
life
fair
crown
ah
me
how
i
could
love
my
soul
doth
melt
for
the
unhappy
youth
love
i
have
felt
so
faint
a
kindness
such
a
meek
surrender
to
what
my
own
full
thoughts
had
made
too
tender
that
but
for
tears
my
life
had
fled
away
ye
deaf
and
senseless
minutes
of
the
day
and
thou
old
forest
hold
ye
this
for
true
there
is
no
lightning
no
authentic
dew
but
in
the
eye
of
love
there
not
a
sound
melodious
howsoever
can
confound
the
heavens
and
earth
in
one
to
such
a
death
as
doth
the
voice
of
love
there
not
a
breath
will
mingle
kindly
with
the
meadow
air
till
it
has
panted
round
and
stolen
a
share
of
passion
from
the
heart
upon
a
bough
he
leant
wretched
he
surely
can
not
now
thirst
for
another
love
o
impious
that
he
can
even
dream
upon
it
thus
thought
he
why
am
i
not
as
are
the
dead
since
to
a
woe
like
this
i
have
been
led
through
the
dark
earth
and
through
the
wondrous
sea
goddess
i
love
thee
not
the
less
from
thee
by
juno
smile
i
turn
not
no
no
no
while
the
great
waters
are
at
ebb
and
i
have
a
triple
soul
o
fond
pretence
for
both
for
both
my
love
is
so
immense
i
feel
my
heart
is
cut
in
twain
for
them
and
so
he
groan
as
one
by
beauty
slain
the
lady
heart
beat
quick
and
he
could
see
her
gentle
bosom
heave
tumultuously
he
sprang
from
his
green
covert
there
she
lay
sweet
as
a
muskrose
upon
hay
with
all
her
limbs
on
tremble
and
her
eyes
shut
softly
up
alive
to
speak
he
tries
fair
damsel
pity
me
forgive
that
i
thus
violate
thy
bower
sanctity
o
pardon
me
for
i
am
full
of
grief
grief
born
of
thee
young
angel
fairest
thief
who
stolen
hast
away
the
wings
wherewith
i
was
to
top
the
heavens
dear
maid
sith
thou
art
my
executioner
and
i
feel
loving
and
hatred
misery
and
weal
will
in
a
few
short
hours
be
nothing
to
me
and
all
my
story
that
much
passion
slew
me
do
smile
upon
the
evening
of
my
days
and
for
my
tortur
brain
begins
to
craze
be
thou
my
nurse
and
let
me
understand
how
dying
i
shall
kiss
that
lily
dost
weep
for
me
then
should
i
be
content
scowl
on
ye
fates
until
the
firmament
outblackens
erebus
and
the
earth
crumbles
into
itself
by
the
cloud
girth
of
jove
those
tears
have
given
me
a
thirst
to
meet
oblivion
as
her
heart
would
burst
the
maiden
sobb
awhile
and
then
replied
why
must
such
desolation
betide
as
that
thou
speakest
of
are
not
these
green
nooks
empty
of
all
misfortune
do
the
brooks
utter
a
gorgon
voice
does
yonder
thrush
schooling
its
little
ones
to
brush
about
the
dewy
forest
whisper
tales
speak
not
of
grief
young
stranger
or
cold
snails
will
slime
the
rose
to
night
though
if
thou
wilt
methinks
be
a
guilt
a
very
guilt
not
to
companion
thee
and
sigh
away
the
light
the
dusk
the
dark
till
break
of
day
dear
lady
said
endymion
is
past
i
love
thee
and
my
days
can
never
last
that
i
may
pass
in
patience
still
speak
let
me
have
music
dying
and
i
seek
no
more
delight
i
bid
adieu
to
all
didst
thou
not
after
other
climates
call
and
murmur
about
indian
streams
then
she
sitting
beneath
the
midmost
forest
tree
for
pity
sang
this
roundelay
o
sorrow
why
dost
borrow
the
natural
hue
of
health
from
vermeil
lips
to
give
maiden
blushes
to
the
white
rose
bushes
or
is
it
thy
dewy
hand
the
daisy
tips
o
sorrow
why
dost
borrow
the
lustrous
passion
from
a
to
give
the
light
or
on
a
moonless
night
to
tinge
on
syren
shores
the
salt
o
sorrow
why
dost
borrow
the
mellow
ditties
from
a
mourning
tongue
to
give
at
evening
pale
unto
the
nightingale
that
thou
mayst
listen
the
cold
dews
among
o
sorrow
why
dost
borrow
heart
lightness
from
the
merriment
of
may
a
lover
would
not
tread
a
cowslip
on
the
head
though
he
should
dance
from
eve
till
peep
of
day
nor
any
drooping
flower
held
sacred
for
thy
bower
wherever
he
may
sport
himself
and
play
to
sorrow
i
bade
and
thought
to
leave
her
far
away
behind
but
cheerly
cheerly
she
loves
me
dearly
she
is
so
constant
to
me
and
so
kind
i
would
deceive
her
and
so
leave
her
but
ah
she
is
so
constant
and
so
kind
beneath
my
palm
trees
by
the
river
side
i
sat
a
weeping
in
the
whole
world
wide
there
was
no
one
to
ask
me
why
i
wept
and
so
i
kept
brimming
the
cups
with
tears
cold
as
my
fears
beneath
my
palm
trees
by
the
river
side
i
sat
a
weeping
what
enamour
bride
cheated
by
shadowy
wooer
from
the
clouds
but
hides
and
shrouds
beneath
dark
palm
trees
by
a
river
side
and
as
i
sat
over
the
light
blue
hills
there
came
a
noise
of
revellers
the
rills
into
the
wide
stream
came
of
purple
hue
was
bacchus
and
his
crew
the
earnest
trumpet
spake
and
silver
thrills
from
kissing
cymbals
made
a
merry
din
was
bacchus
and
his
kin
like
to
a
moving
vintage
down
they
came
crown
with
green
leaves
and
faces
all
on
flame
all
madly
dancing
through
the
pleasant
valley
to
scare
thee
melancholy
o
then
o
then
thou
wast
a
simple
name
and
i
forgot
thee
as
the
berried
holly
by
shepherds
is
forgotten
when
in
june
tall
chesnuts
keep
away
the
sun
and
moon
i
rush
into
the
folly
within
his
car
aloft
young
bacchus
stood
trifling
his
in
dancing
mood
with
sidelong
laughing
and
little
rills
of
crimson
wine
imbrued
his
plump
white
arms
and
shoulders
enough
white
for
venus
pearly
bite
and
near
him
rode
silenus
on
his
ass
pelted
with
flowers
as
he
on
did
pass
tipsily
quaffing
whence
came
ye
merry
damsels
whence
came
ye
so
many
and
so
many
and
such
glee
why
have
ye
left
your
bowers
desolate
your
lutes
and
gentler
fate
follow
bacchus
bacchus
on
the
wing
a
conquering
bacchus
young
bacchus
good
or
ill
betide
we
dance
before
him
thorough
kingdoms
wide
come
hither
lady
fair
and
joined
be
to
our
wild
minstrelsy
whence
came
ye
jolly
satyrs
whence
came
ye
so
many
and
so
many
and
such
glee
why
have
ye
left
your
forest
haunts
why
left
your
nuts
in
cleft
wine
for
wine
we
left
our
kernel
tree
for
wine
we
left
our
heath
and
yellow
brooms
and
cold
mushrooms
for
wine
we
follow
bacchus
through
the
earth
great
god
of
breathless
cups
and
chirping
mirth
come
hither
lady
fair
and
joined
be
to
our
mad
minstrelsy
over
wide
streams
and
mountains
great
we
went
and
save
when
bacchus
kept
his
ivy
tent
onward
the
tiger
and
the
leopard
pants
with
asian
elephants
onward
these
myriads
with
song
and
dance
with
zebras
striped
and
sleek
arabians
prance
alligators
crocodiles
bearing
upon
their
scaly
backs
in
files
plump
infant
laughers
mimicking
the
coil
of
seamen
and
stout
toil
with
toying
oars
and
silken
sails
they
glide
nor
care
for
wind
and
tide
mounted
on
panthers
furs
and
lions
manes
from
rear
to
van
they
scour
about
the
plains
a
three
days
journey
in
a
moment
done
and
always
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
about
the
wilds
they
hunt
with
spear
and
horn
on
spleenful
unicorn
i
saw
osirian
egypt
kneel
adown
before
the
crown
i
saw
parch
abyssinia
rouse
and
sing
to
the
silver
cymbals
ring
i
saw
the
whelming
vintage
hotly
pierce
old
tartary
the
fierce
the
kings
of
inde
their
vail
and
from
their
treasures
scatter
pearled
hail
great
brahma
from
his
mystic
heaven
groans
and
all
his
priesthood
moans
before
young
bacchus
turning
into
these
regions
came
i
following
him
sick
hearted
weary
so
i
took
a
whim
to
stray
away
into
these
forests
drear
alone
without
a
peer
and
i
have
told
thee
all
thou
mayest
hear
young
stranger
i
been
a
ranger
in
search
of
pleasure
throughout
every
clime
alas
is
not
for
me
bewitch
i
sure
must
be
to
lose
in
grieving
all
my
maiden
prime
come
then
sorrow
sweetest
sorrow
like
an
own
babe
i
nurse
thee
on
my
breast
i
thought
to
leave
thee
and
deceive
thee
but
now
of
all
the
world
i
love
thee
best
there
is
not
one
no
no
not
one
but
thee
to
comfort
a
poor
lonely
maid
thou
art
her
mother
and
her
brother
her
playmate
and
her
wooer
in
the
shade
o
what
a
sigh
she
gave
in
finishing
and
look
quite
dead
to
every
worldly
thing
endymion
could
not
speak
but
gazed
on
her
and
listened
to
the
wind
that
now
did
stir
about
the
crisped
oaks
full
drearily
yet
with
as
sweet
a
softness
as
might
be
remember
from
its
velvet
summer
song
at
last
he
said
poor
lady
how
thus
long
have
i
been
able
to
endure
that
voice
fair
melody
kind
syren
i
no
choice
i
must
be
thy
sad
servant
evermore
i
can
not
choose
but
kneel
here
and
adore
alas
i
must
not
think
by
phœbe
no
let
me
not
think
soft
angel
shall
it
be
so
say
beautifullest
shall
i
never
think
o
thou
foster
me
beyond
the
brink
of
recollection
make
my
watchful
care
close
up
its
bloodshot
eyes
nor
see
despair
do
gently
murder
half
my
soul
and
i
shall
feel
the
other
half
so
utterly
i
giddy
at
that
cheek
so
fair
and
smooth
o
let
it
blush
so
ever
let
it
soothe
my
madness
let
it
mantle
with
the
tinge
of
love
panting
in
safe
this
can
not
be
thy
hand
and
yet
it
is
and
this
is
sure
thine
other
softling
this
thine
own
fair
bosom
and
i
am
so
near
wilt
fall
asleep
o
let
me
sip
that
tear
and
whisper
one
sweet
word
that
i
may
know
this
is
this
world
sweet
dewy
blossom
woe
woe
to
that
endymion
where
is
he
even
these
words
went
echoing
dismally
through
the
wide
forest
a
most
fearful
tone
like
one
repenting
in
his
latest
moan
and
while
it
died
away
a
shade
pass
by
as
of
a
thunder
cloud
when
arrows
fly
through
the
thick
branches
poor
sleek
forth
their
timid
necks
and
tremble
so
these
both
leant
to
each
other
trembling
and
sat
so
waiting
for
some
destruction
when
lo
mercury
appear
sublime
beyond
the
tall
tree
tops
and
in
less
time
than
shoots
the
slanted
down
he
dropt
towards
the
ground
but
rested
not
nor
stopt
one
moment
from
his
home
only
the
sward
he
with
his
wand
light
touch
and
heavenward
swifter
than
sight
was
gone
even
before
the
teeming
earth
a
sudden
witness
bore
of
his
swift
magic
diving
swans
appear
above
the
crystal
circlings
white
and
clear
and
catch
the
cheated
eye
in
wild
surprise
how
they
can
dive
in
sight
and
unseen
rise
so
from
the
turf
outsprang
two
steeds
each
with
large
dark
blue
wings
upon
his
back
the
youth
of
caria
plac
the
lovely
dame
on
one
and
felt
himself
in
spleen
to
tame
the
other
fierceness
through
the
air
they
flew
high
as
the
eagles
like
two
drops
of
dew
exhal
to
phœbus
lips
away
they
are
gone
far
from
the
earth
away
unseen
alone
among
cool
clouds
and
winds
but
that
the
free
the
buoyant
life
of
song
can
floating
be
above
their
heads
and
follow
them
muse
of
my
native
land
am
i
inspir
this
is
the
giddy
air
and
i
must
spread
wide
pinions
to
keep
here
nor
do
i
dread
or
height
or
depth
or
width
or
any
chance
precipitous
i
have
beneath
my
glance
those
towering
horses
and
their
mournful
freight
could
i
thus
sail
and
see
and
thus
await
fearless
for
power
of
thought
without
thine
aid
there
is
a
sleepy
dusk
an
odorous
shade
from
some
approaching
wonder
and
behold
those
winged
steeds
with
snorting
nostrils
bold
snuff
at
its
faint
extreme
and
seem
to
tire
dying
to
embers
from
their
native
fire
there
curl
a
purple
mist
around
them
soon
it
seem
as
when
around
the
pale
new
moon
sad
zephyr
droops
the
clouds
like
weeping
willow
was
sleep
slow
journeying
with
head
on
pillow
for
the
first
time
since
he
came
nigh
dead
born
from
the
old
womb
of
night
his
cave
forlorn
had
he
left
more
forlorn
for
the
first
time
he
felt
aloof
the
day
and
morning
prime
because
into
his
depth
cimmerian
there
came
a
dream
shewing
how
a
young
man
ere
a
lean
bat
could
plump
its
wintery
skin
would
at
high
jove
empyreal
footstool
win
an
immortality
and
how
espouse
jove
daughter
and
be
reckon
of
his
house
now
was
he
slumbering
towards
heaven
gate
that
he
might
at
the
threshold
one
hour
wait
to
hear
the
marriage
melodies
and
then
sink
downward
to
his
dusky
cave
again
his
litter
of
smooth
semilucent
mist
diversely
ting
with
rose
and
amethyst
puzzled
those
eyes
that
for
the
centre
sought
and
scarcely
for
one
moment
could
be
caught
his
sluggish
form
reposing
motionless
those
two
on
winged
steeds
with
all
the
stress
of
vision
search
for
him
as
one
would
look
athwart
the
sallows
of
a
river
nook
to
catch
a
glance
at
silver
throated
eels
or
from
old
skiddaw
top
when
fog
conceals
his
rugged
forehead
in
a
mantle
pale
with
an
towards
some
pleasant
vale
descry
a
favourite
hamlet
faint
and
far
these
raven
horses
though
they
foster
are
of
earth
splenetic

dully
drop
their
ears

wide
and
stop
upon
the
spiritless
mist

they
outspread
their
ample
feathers
are
in
slumber
dead
and
on
those
pinions
level
in
mid
air
endymion
sleepeth
and
the
lady
fair
slowly
they
sail
slowly
as
icy
isle
upon
a
calm
sea
drifting
and
meanwhile
the
mournful
wanderer
dreams
behold
he
walks
on
heaven
pavement
brotherly
he
talks
to
divine
powers
from
his
hand
full
fain
juno
proud
birds
are
pecking
pearly
grain
he
tries
the
nerve
of
phœbus
golden
bow
and
asketh
where
the
golden
apples
grow
upon
his
arm
he
braces
pallas

strives
in

to
unsettle
and

and

well
a

fond
so
beauteous

he
turn

there
nought
for

upon
the
bourne

misery
these
words
awoke
the
stranger
of
dark

her
dawning
rapt
endymion
blesses
with
soft
sleep
yawned
from
underneath
thou
swan
of

it

about

forgive

away
he
rous
the
steeds
they
beat
their
wings
chivalrous
into
the
clear
air
leaving
old
sleep
within
his
vapoury
lair
the
blush
of
eve
was
waning
slow
and
vesper
risen
star
began
to
throe
in
the
dusk
heavens
silvery
when
they
thus
sprang
direct
towards
the
galaxy
nor
did
speed
hinder
converse
soft
and
strange
eternal
oaths
and
vows
they
interchange
in
such
wise
in
such
temper
so
aloof
up
in
the
winds
beneath
a
starry
roof
so
witless
of
their
doom
that
verily
is
well
nigh
past
man
search
their
hearts
to
see
whether
they
wept
or
laugh
or
griev
or
toy
most
like
with
joy
gone
mad
with
sorrow
cloy
fell
facing
their
swift
flight
from
ebon
streak
the
moon

forth
a
little
diamond
peak
no
bigger
than
an
unobserved
star
or
tiny
point
of
fairy
scymetar
bright
signal
that
she
only
stoop
to
tie
her
silver
sandals
ere
deliciously
she
bow
into
the
heavens
her
timid
head
slowly
she
rose
as
though
she
would
have
fled
while
to
his
lady
meek
the
carian
turn
to
mark
if
her
dark
eyes
had
yet
this
beauty
in
its
birth
despair
despair
he
saw
her
body
fading
gaunt
and
spare
in
the
cold
moonshine
straight
he
seiz
her
wrist
it
melted
from
his
grasp
her
hand
he
kiss
and
horror
kiss
his
own
he
was
alone
her
steed
a
little
higher
soar
and
then
dropt
hawkwise
to
the
earth
there
lies
a
den
beyond
the
seeming
confines
of
the
space
made
for
the
soul
to
wander
in
and
trace
its
own
existence
of
remotest
glooms
dark
regions
are
around
it
where
the
tombs
of
buried
griefs
the
spirit
sees
but
scarce
one
hour
doth
linger
weeping
for
the
pierce
of
woe
it
feels
more
inly
smart
and
in
these
regions
many
a
venom
dart
at
random
flies
they
are
the
proper
home
of
every
ill
the
man
is
yet
to
come
who
hath
not
journeyed
in
this
native
hell
but
few
have
ever
felt
how
calm
and
well
sleep
may
be
had
in
that
deep
den
of
all
there
anguish
does
not
sting
nor
pleasure
pall
beat
ever
at
the
gate
yet
all
is
still
within
and
desolate
beset
with
plainful
gusts
within
ye
hear
no
sound
so
loud
as
when
on
curtain
bier
the
tick
is
stifled
enter
none
who
strive
therefore
on
the
sudden
it
is
won
just
when
the
sufferer
begins
to
burn
then
it
is
free
to
him
and
from
an
urn
still
fed
by
melting
ice
he
takes
a
draught
young
semele
such
richness
never
quaft
in
her
maternal
longing

not

i
to

my
sweetest

here
here
will
i
kneel
for
thou

hast
my

from
too
thin
breathing
gone
and
past
are
cloudy
phantasms
caverns
lone
farewel
and
air
of
visions
and
the

seas
no
never

cheat
me
to
the

wonder
breathless
and

adieu
my

may
come

on

i
may
not
love
thee
and
therefore
doves
will
i
offer
up
and
sweetest
store
all
through
the
teeming
year
so
thou
wilt
shine
on
me
and
on
this
damsel
fair
of
mine
and
bless
our
simple
lives
my
indian
bliss
my
bud
one
human
kiss
one
sigh
of
real
breath
one
gentle
squeeze
warm
as
a
dove
nest
among
summer
trees
and
warm
with
dew
at
ooze
from
living
blood
whither
didst
melt
ah
what
of
that
all
good
we
talk
about
no
more
of
now
where
shall
our
dwelling
be
under
the
brow
of
some
steep
mossy
hill
where
ivy
dun
would
hide
us
up
although
spring
leaves
were
none
and
where
dark
yew
trees
as
we
rustle
through
will
drop
their
scarlet
berry
cups
of
dew
o
thou
wouldst
joy
to
live
in
such
a
place
dusk
for
our
loves
yet
light
enough
to
grace
those
gentle
limbs
on
mossy
bed
reclin
for
by
one
step
the
blue
sky
shouldst
thou
find
and
by
another
in
deep
dell
below
see
through
the
trees
a
little
river
go
all
in
its
gold
and
glimmering
honey
from
out
the
gnarled
hive
i
bring
and
apples
wan
with
sweetness
gather
thee
cresses
that
grow
where
no
man
may
them
see
and
sorrel
untorn
by
the
stag
pipes
will
i
fashion
of
the
syrinx

that
thou
mayst
always
know
whither
i

thee
in
our
quiet
home

and

of

me

into
the
joy
i
seek
for

prison
me
the
rill
thou
haply
mayst
delight
in

i
fill
with
fairy
fishes
from
the

and
thou
shall
feed
them
from
the
squirrel
barn
its
bottom
will
i
strew
with
amber
shells
and
pebbles
blue
from
deep
enchanted
wells
its
sides
i
plant
with
eglantine
and
honeysuckles
full
of

is
not
bliss
within
our
perfect
seisure
o
that
i
could
not
doubt
the
mountaineer
thus
strove
by
fancies
vain
and
crude
to
clear
his
briar
path
to
some
tranquillity
it
gave
bright
gladness
to
his
lady
eye
and
yet
the
tears
she
wept
were
tears
of
sorrow
answering
thus
just
as
the
golden
morrow
beam
upward
from
the
vallies
of
the
east
o
that
the
flutter
of
this
heart
had
ceas
or
the
sweet
name
of
love
had
pass
away
young
feathor
tyrant
by
a
swift
decay
wilt
thou
devote
this
body
to
the
earth
and
i
do
think
that
at
my
very
birth
i
lisp
thy
blooming
titles
inwardly
for
at
the
first
first
dawn
and
thought
of
thee
with
uplift
hands
i
blest
the
stars
of
heaven
art
thou
not
cruel
ever
have
i
striven
to
think
thee
kind
but
ah
it
will
not
do
when
yet
a
child
i
heard
that
kisses
drew
favour
from
thee
and
so
i
gave
and
gave
to
the
void
air
bidding
them
find
out
love
but
when
i
came
to
feel
how
far
above
all
fancy
pride
and
fickle
maidenhood
all
earthly
pleasure
all
imagin
good
was
the
warm
tremble
of
a
devout
kiss
even
then
that
moment
at
the
thought
of
this
fainting
i
fell
into
a
bed
of
flowers
and
languish
there
three
days
ye
milder
powers
am
i
not
cruelly
wrong
believe
believe
me
dear
endymion
were
i
to
weave
with
my
own
fancies
garlands
of
sweet
life
thou
shouldst
be
one
of
all
ah
bitter
strife
i
may
not
be
thy
love
i
am
forbidden
indeed
i
am
thwarted
affrighted
chidden
by
things
i
trembled
at
and
gorgon
wrath
twice
hast
thou
ask
whither
i
went
henceforth
ask
me
no
more
i
may
not
utter
it
nor
may
i
be
thy
love
we
might
commit
ourselves
at
once
to
vengeance
we
might
die
we
might
embrace
and
die
voluptuous
thought
enlarge
not
to
my
hunger
or
i
caught
in
trammels
of
perverse
deliciousness
no
no
that
shall
not
be
thee
will
i
bless
and
bid
a
long
adieu
the
carian
no
word
return
both
lovelorn
silent
wan
into
the
vallies
green
together
went
far
wandering
they
were
perforce
content
to
sit
beneath
a
fair
lone
beechen
tree
nor
at
each
other
gaz
but
heavily
por
on
its
hazle
cirque
of
shedded
leaves
endymion
unhappy
it
nigh
grieves
me
to
behold
thee
thus
in
last
extreme
ensky
ere
this
but
truly
that
i
deem
truth
the
best
music
in
a
song
thy
brother
will
i
sing
ere
long
and
thou
shall
aid
hast
thou
not
aided
me
yes
moonlight
emperor
felicity
has
been
thy
meed
for
many
thousand
years
yet
often
have
i
on
the
brink
of
tears
mourn
as
if
yet
thou
wert
a
forester
forgetting
the
old
tale
he
did
not
stir
his
eyes
from
the
dead
leaves
or
one
small
pulse
of
joy
he
might
have
felt
the
spirit
culls
unfaded
amaranth
when
wild
it
strays
through
the
old
of
boyish
days
a
little
onward
ran
the
very
stream
by
which
he
took
his
first
soft
poppy
dream
and
on
the
very
bark
which
he
leant
a
crescent
he
had
carv
and
round
it
spent
his
skill
in
little
stars
the
teeming
tree
had
swollen
and
green
the
pious
charactery
but
not
out
why
there
was
not
a
slope
up
which
he
had
not
fear
the
antelope
and
not
a
tree
beneath
whose
rooty
shade
he
had
not
with
his
tamed
leopards
play
nor
could
an
arrow
light
or
javelin
fly
in
the
air
where
his
had
never
been
and
yet
he
knew
it
not
o
treachery
why
does
his
lady
smile
pleasing
her
eye
with
all
his
sorrowing
he
sees
her
not
but
who
so
stares
on
him
his
sister
sure
peona
of
the
woods
can
she
endure
impossible
how
dearly
they
embrace
his
lady
smiles
delight
is
in
her
face
it
is
no
treachery
dear
brother
mine
endymion
weep
not
so
why
shouldst
thou
pine
when
all
great
latmos
so
exalt
will
be
thank
the
great
gods
and
look
not
bitterly
and
speak
not
one
pale
word
and
sigh
no
more
sure
i
will
not
believe
thou
hast
such
store
of
grief
to
last
thee
to
my
kiss
again
thou
surely
canst
not
bear
a
mind
in
pain
come
hand
in
hand
with
one
so
beautiful
be
happy
both
of
you
for
i
will
pull
the
flowers
of
autumn
for
your
coronals
pan
holy
priest
for
young
endymion
calls
and
when
he
is
restor
thou
fairest
dame
shalt
be
our
queen
now
is
it
not
a
shame
to
see
ye
thus
not
very
very
sad
perhaps
ye
are
too
happy
to
be
glad
o
feel
as
if
it
were
a
common
day
as
one
who
never
was
away
no
tongue
shall
ask
whence
come
ye
but
ye
shall
be
gods
of
your
own
rest
imperial
not
even
i
for
one
whole
month
will
pry
into
the
hours
that
have
pass
us
by
since
in
my
arbour
i
did
sing
to
thee
o
hermes
on
this
very
night
will
be
a
hymning
up
to
cynthia
queen
of
light
for
the
soothsayers
old
saw
yesternight
good
visions
in
the
air
whence
will
befal
as
say
these
sages
health
perpetual
to
shepherds
and
their
flocks
and
furthermore
in
dian
face
they
read
the
gentle
lore
therefore
for
her
these
are
our
friends
will
all
be
there
from
nigh
and
far
many
upon
thy
death
have
ditties
made
and
many
even
now
their
foreheads
shade
with
cypress
on
a
day
of
sacrifice
new
singing
for
our
maids
shalt
thou
devise
and
pluck
the
sorrow
from
our
huntsmen
brows
tell
me
my
how
to
espouse
this
wayward
brother
to
his
rightful
joys
his
eyes
are
on
thee
bent
as
thou
didst
poise
his
fate
most
help
me
i
pray
to
lure
endymion
dear
brother
say
what
ails
thee
he
could
bear
no
more
and
so
bent
his
soul
fiercely
like
a
spiritual
bow
and
twang
it
inwardly
and
calmly
said
i
would
have
thee
my
only
friend
sweet
maid
my
only
visitor
not
ignorant
though
that
those
deceptions
which
for
pleasure
go
men
are
pleasures
real
as
real
may
be
but
there
are
higher
ones
i
may
not
see
if
impiously
an
earthly
realm
i
take
since
i
saw
thee
i
have
been
wide
awake
night
after
night
and
day
by
day
until
of
the
empyrean
i
have
drunk
my
fill
let
it
content
thee
sister
seeing
me
more
happy
than
betides
mortality
a
hermit
young
i
live
in
mossy
cave
where
thou
alone
shalt
come
to
me
and
lave
thy
spirit
in
the
wonders
i
shall
tell
through
me
the
shepherd
realm
shall
prosper
well
for
to
thy
tongue
will
i
all
health
confide
and
for
my
sake
let
this
young
maid
abide
with
thee
as
a
dear
sister
thou
alone
peona
mayst
return
to
me
i
own
this
may
sound
strangely
but
when
dearest
girl
thou
seest
it
for
my
happiness
no
pearl
will
trespass
down
those
cheeks
companion
fair
wilt
be
content
to
dwell
with
her
to
share
this
sister
love
with
me
like
one
and
bent
by
circumstance
and
thereby
blind
in
thus
that
meek
unknown
aye
but
a
buzzing
by
my
ears
has
flown
of
jubilee
to
dian
truth
i
heard
well
then
i
see
there
is
no
little
bird
tender
soever
but
is
jove
own
care
long
have
i
sought
for
rest
and
unaware
behold
i
find
it
so
exalted
too
so
after
my
own
heart
i
knew
i
knew
there
was
a
place
untenanted
in
it
in
that
same
void
white
chastity
shall
sit
and
monitor
me
nightly
to
lone
slumber
with
sanest
lips
i
vow
me
to
the
number
of
dian
sisterhood
and
kind
lady
with
thy
good
help
this
very
night
shall
see
my
future
days
to
her
fane
consecrate
as
feels
a
dreamer
what
doth
most
create
his
own
particular
fright
so
these
three
felt
or
like
one
who
in
after
ages
knelt
to
lucifer
or
baal
when
he
pine
after
a
little
sleep
or
when
in
mine
far
a
sleeper
meets
his
friends
who
know
him
not
each
diligently
bends
towards
common
thoughts
and
things
for
very
fear
striving
their
ghastly
malady
to
cheer
by
thinking
it
a
thing
of
yes
and
no
that
housewives
talk
of
but
the
was
struck
and
all
were
dreamers
at
the
last
endymion
said
are
not
our
fates
all
cast
why
stand
we
here
adieu
ye
tender
pair
adieu
whereat
those
maidens
with
wild
stare
walk
dizzily
away
pained
and
hot
his
eyes
went
after
them
until
they
got
near
to
a
cypress
grove
whose
deadly
maw
in
one
swift
moment
would
what
then
he
saw
engulph
for
ever
stay
he
cried
ah
stay
turn
damsels
hist
one
word
i
have
to
say
sweet
indian
i
would
see
thee
once
again
it
is
a
thing
i
dote
on
so
i
fain
peona
ye
should
hand
in
hand
repair
into
those
holy
groves
that
silent
are
behind
great
dian
temple
i
be
yon
at
vesper
earliest
twinkle
they
are
gone
but
once
once
once
again
at
this
he
his
hands
against
his
face
and
then
did
rest
his
head
upon
a
mossy
hillock
green
and
so
remain
as
he
a
corpse
had
been
all
the
long
day
save
when
he
scantly
lifted
his
eyes
abroad
to
see
how
shadows
shifted
with
the
slow
move
of
time
sluggish
and
weary
until
the
poplar
tops
in
journey
dreary
had
reach
the
river
brim
then
up
he
rose
and
slowly
as
that
very
river
flows
walk
towards
the
temple
grove
with
this
lament
why
such
a
golden
eve
the
breeze
is
sent
careful
and
soft
that
not
a
leaf
may
fall
before
the
serene
father
of
them
all
bows
down
his
summer
head
below
the
west
now
am
i
of
breath
speech
and
speed
possest
but
at
the
setting
i
must
bid
adieu
to
her
for
the
last
time
night
will
strew
on
the
damp
grass
myriads
of
lingering
leaves
and
with
them
shall
i
die
nor
much
it
grieves
to
die
when
summer
dies
on
the
cold
sward
why
i
have
been
a
butterfly
a
lord
of
flowers
garlands
silly
posies
groves
meadows
melodies
and
arbour
roses
my
kingdom
at
its
death
and
just
it
is
that
i
should
die
with
it
so
in
all
this
we
miscal
grief
bale
sorrow
heartbreak
woe
what
is
there
to
plain
of
by
titan
foe
i
am
but
rightly
serv
so
saying
he
tripp
lightly
on
in
sort
of
deathful
glee
laughing
at
the
clear
stream
and
setting
sun
as
though
they
jests
had
been
nor
had
he
done
his
laugh
at
nature
holy
countenance
until
that
grove
appear
as
if
perchance
and
then
his
tongue
with
sober
seemlihed
gave
utterance
as
he
entered
ha
i
said
king
of
the
butterflies
but
by
this
gloom
and
by
old
rhadamanthus
tongue
of
doom
this
dusk
religion
pomp
of
solitude
and
the
promethean
clay
by
thief
endued
by
old
saturnus
forelock
by
his
head
shook
with
eternal
palsy
i
did
wed
myself
to
things
of
light
from
infancy
and
thus
to
be
cast
out
thus
lorn
to
die
is
sure
enough
to
make
a
mortal
man
grow
impious
so
he
inwardly
began
on
things
for
which
no
wording
can
be
found
deeper
and
deeper
sinking
until
beyond
the
reach
of
music
for
the
choir
of
cynthia
he
heard
not
though
rough
briar
nor
muffling
thicket
interpos
to
dull
the
vesper
hymn
far
swollen
soft
and
full
through
the
dark
pillars
of
those
sylvan
aisles
he
saw
not
the
two
maidens
nor
their
smiles
wan
as
primroses
gather
at
midnight
by
chilly
finger
spring
unhappy
wight
endymion
said
peona
we
are
here
what
wouldst
thou
ere
we
all
are
laid
on
bier
then
he
embrac
her
and
his
lady
hand
press
saying
sister
i
would
have
command
if
it
were
heaven
will
on
our
sad
fate
at
which
that
stranger
stood
elate
and
said
in
a
new
voice
but
sweet
as
love
to
endymion
amaze
by
cupid
dove
and
so
thou
shalt
and
by
the
lily
truth
of
my
own
breast
thou
shalt
beloved
youth
and
as
she
spake
into
her
face
there
came
light
as
reflected
from
a
silver
flame
her
long
black
hair
swell
ampler
in
display
full
golden
in
her
eyes
a
brighter
day
dawn
blue
and
full
of
love
aye
he
beheld
phœbe
his
passion
joyous
she
upheld
her
lucid
bow
continuing
thus
drear
drear
has
our
delaying
been
but
foolish
fear
withheld
me
first
and
then
decrees
of
fate
and
then
was
fit
that
from
this
mortal
state
thou
shouldst
my
love
by
some
unlook
for
change
be
spiritualiz
peona
we
shall
range
these
forests
and
to
thee
they
safe
shall
be
as
was
thy
cradle
hither
shalt
thou
flee
to
meet
us
many
a
time
next
cynthia
bright
peona
kiss
and

with
fair
good
night
her
brother
kiss
her
too
and
knelt
adown
before
his
goddess
in
a
blissful
swoon
she
gave
her
fair
hands
to
him
and
behold
before
three
swiftest
kisses
he
had
told
they
vanish
far
away
peona
went
home
through
the
gloomy
wood

wonderment
