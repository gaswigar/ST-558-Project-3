second

i
the
national
letters
and
their
it
is
convenient
to
begin
like
the
gentlemen
of
god
with
a
glance
at
a
text
or
two
the
first
a
short
one
is
from
ralph
waldo
celebrated
oration
the
american
scholar
delivered
before
the
phi
beta
kappa
society
at
cambridge
on
august
emerson
was
then
years
old
and
almost
unknown
in
his
own
country
though
he
had
already
published
nature
and
established
his
first
contacts
with
landor
and
carlyle
but
the
american
scholar
brought
him
into
instant
notice
at
home
partly
as
man
of
letters
but
more
importantly
as
seer
and
prophet
and
the
fame
thus
founded
has
endured
without
much
diminution
at
all
events
in
new
england
to
this
day
oliver
wendell
holmes
giving
words
to
what
was
undoubtedly
the
common
feeling
hailed
the
address
as
the
intellectual
declaration
of
independence
of
the
american
people
and
that
judgment
amiably
passed
on
by
three
generations
of
pedagogues
still
survives
in
the
literature
books
i
quote
from
the
first
paragraph
our
day
of
dependence
our
long
apprenticeship
to
the
learning
of
other
lands
draws
to
a
close
events
actions
arise
that
must
be
sung
that
will
sing
themselves
who
can
doubt
that
poetry
will
revive
and
lead
in
a
new
age
as
the
star
in
the
constellation
harp
which
now
flames
in
our
zenith
astronomers
announce
shall
one
day
be
the
for
a
thousand
years
this
as
i
say
was
in
years
later
in
walt
whitman
echoed
the
prophecy
in
his
even
more
famous
democratic
vistas
what
he
saw
in
his
vision
and
put
into
his
gnarled
and
gasping
prose
was
a
class
of
native
authors
literatuses
far
different
far
higher
in
grade
than
any
yet
known
sacerdotal
modern
fit
to
cope
with
our
occasions
lands
permeating
the
whole
mass
of
american
morality
taste
belief
breathing
into
it
a
new
breath
of
life
giving
it
decision
affecting
politics
far
more
than
the
popular
superficial
suffrage
with
results
inside
and
underneath
the
elections
of
presidents
or
congress
radiating
begetting
appropriate
teachers
schools
manners
and
as
its
grandest
result
accomplishing
what
neither
the
schools
nor
the
churches
and
their
clergy
have
hitherto
accomplished
and
without
which
this
nation
will
no
more
stand
permanently
soundly
than
a
house
will
stand
without
a
substratum
a
religious
and
moral
character
beneath
the
political
and
productive
and
intellectual
bases
of
the
states
and
out
of
the
vision
straightway
came
the
prognostication
the
promulgation
and
belief
in
such
a
class
or
order
a
new
and
greater
literatus
order
its
possibility
nay
certainty
underlies
these
entire
speculations
above
all
previous
lands
a
great
original
literature
is
sure
to
become
the
justification
and
reliance
in
some
respects
the
sole
reliance
of
american
democracy
thus
whitman
in
the
time
of
the
first
draft
of
democratic
vistas
he
was
of
the
same
mind
and
said
so
in
four
years
before
his
death
i
could
bring
up
texts
of
like
tenor
in
great
number
from
the
years
before
from
those
after
and
from
every
decade
between
the
dream
of
emerson
though
the
eloquence
of
its
statement
was
new
and
arresting
embodied
no
novel
projection
of
the
fancy
it
merely
gave
a
sonorous
tone
to
what
had
been
dreamed
and
said
before
you
will
find
almost
the
same
high
hope
the
same
exuberant
confidence
in
the
essays
of
the
elder
channing
and
in
the
lectures
on
american
literature
of
samuel
lorenzo
knapp
the
first
native
critic
of
beautiful
letters
the
primordial
tadpole
of
all
our
later
mores
brownells
phelpses
mabies
brander
matthewses
and
other
such
grave
and
glittering
fish
knapp
believed
like
whitman
long
after
him
that
the
sheer
physical
grandeur
of
the
new
world
would
inflame
a
race
of
bards
to
unprecedented
utterance
what
are
the
tibers
and
scamanders
he
demanded
measured
by
the
missouri
and
the
amazon
or
what
the
loveliness
of
illysus
or
avon
by
the
connecticut
or
the
potomack
whenever
a
nation
wills
it
prodigies
are
born
that
is
to
say
prodigies
literary
and
ineffable
as
well
as
purely
material
prodigies
aimed
in
his
own
words
at
the
olympick
crown
as
well
as
at
mere
railroads
ships
wheatfields
droves
of
hogs
factories
and
money
nor
were
channing
and
knapp
the
first
of
the
haruspices
noah
webster
the
lexicographer
who
taught
millions
to
spell
but
not
one
to
sin
had
seen
the
early
starlight
of
the
same
golden
age
so
early
as
as
the
curious
will
find
by
examining
his
dissertations
on
the
english
language
a
work
fallen
long
since
into
undeserved
oblivion
nor
was
whitman
taking
sober
second
thought
exactly
a
century
later
the
last
of
them
out
of
many
brethren
of
our
own
day
extravagantly
articulate
in
print
and
among
the
chautauquas
i
choose
one
not
because
his
hope
is
of
purest
water
but
precisely
because
like
emerson
he
dilutes
it
with
various
discreet
he
is
van
wyck
brooks
a
young
man
far
more
intelligent
penetrating
and
hospitable
to
fact
than
any
of
the
reigning
professors
a
critic
who
is
sharply
differentiated
from
them
indeed
by
the
simple
circumstance
that
he
has
information
and
sense
yet
this
extraordinary
brooks
in
his
letters
and
leadership
published
in
rewrites
the
american
scholar
in
terms
borrowed
almost
bodily
from
democratic
vistas
that
is
to
say
he
prophesies
with
emerson
and
exults
with
whitman
first
there
is
the
emersonian
doctrine
of
the
soaring
individual
made
articulate
by
freedom
and
realizing
the
responsibility
that
lies
upon
us
each
in
the
measure
of
his
own
gift
and
then
there
is
whitman
vision
of
a
democracy
forced
into
high
literary
adventures
by
joseph
conrad
obscure
inner
necessity
and
so
achieving
a
new
synthesis
adaptable
to
the
unique
conditions
of
our
life
and
finally
there
is
the
specific
prediction
the
grandiose
adam
forepaugh
mirage
we
shall
become
a
luminous
people
dwelling
in
the
light
and
sharing
our
light
as
i
say
the
roll
of
such
soothsayers
might
be
almost
endlessly
lengthened
there
is
in
truth
scarcely
a
formal
discourse
upon
the
national
letters
forgetting
perhaps
barrett
wendell
sour
threnody
upon
the
new
england
that
is
without
some
touch
of
this
previsional
exultation
this
confident
hymning
of
glories
to
come
this
fine
assurance
that
american
literature
in
some
future
always
ready
to
dawn
will
burst
into
so
grand
a
flowering
that
history
will
cherish
its
loveliest
blooms
even
above
such
salient
american
gifts
to
culture
as
the
the
phonograph
the
new
thought
and
the
tablet
if
there
was
ever
a
dissenter
from
the
national
optimism
in
this
as
in
other
departments
it
was
surely
edgar
allan
poe
without
question
the
bravest
and
most
original
if
perhaps
also
the
least
orderly
and
judicious
of
all
the
critics
that
we
have
produced
and
yet
even
poe
despite
his
general
habit
of
disgust
and
dismay
caught
a
flash
or
two
of
that
engaging
picture
even
poe
for
an
instant
in
thought
that
he
saw
the
beginnings
of
a
solid
and
autonomous
native
literature
its
roots
deep
in
the
soil
of
the
republic
as
you
will
discover
by
turning
to
his
forgotten
essay
on
brainard
a
doggereleer
of
jackson
time
poe
of
course
was
too
cautious
to
let
his
imagination
proceed
to
details
one
feels
that
a
certain
doubt
a
saving
peradventure
or
two
played
about
the
unaccustomed
vision
as
he
beheld
it
but
nevertheless
he
unquestionably
beheld
it
answering
now
for
the
answering
fact
how
has
the
issue
replied
to
these
visionaries
it
has
replied
in
a
way
that
is
manifestly
to
the
discomfiture
of
emerson
as
a
prophet
to
the
dismay
of
poe
as
a
pessimist
disarmed
by
transient
optimism
and
to
the
utter
collapse
of
whitman
we
have
as
every
one
knows
produced
no
such
new
and
greater
literatus
order
as
that
announced
by
old
walt
we
have
given
a
gaping
world
no
books
that
radiate
and
surely
none
intelligibly
comparable
to
stars
and
constellations
we
have
achieved
no
prodigies
of
the
first
class
and
very
few
of
the
second
class
and
not
many
of
the
third
and
fourth
classes
our
literature
despite
several
false
starts
that
promised
much
is
chiefly
remarkable
now
as
always
for
its
respectable
mediocrity
its
typical
great
man
in
our
own
time
has
been
howells
as
its
typical
great
man
a
generation
ago
was
lowell
and
two
generations
ago
irving
viewed
largely
its
salient
character
appears
as
a
sort
of
timorous
flaccidity
an
amiable
hollowness
in
bulk
it
grows
more
and
more
formidable
in
ease
and
decorum
it
makes
undoubted
progress
and
on
the
side
of
mere
technic
of
the
bald
capacity
to
write
it
shows
an
competence
but
when
one
proceeds
from
such
agencies
and
externals
to
the
intrinsic
substance
to
the
creative
passion
within
that
substance
quickly
reveals
itself
as
thin
and
watery
and
that
passion
fades
to
something
almost
puerile
in
all
that
mass
of
suave
and
often
highly
diverting
writing
there
is
no
visible
movement
toward
a
distinguished
and
singular
excellence
a
signal
national
quality
a
ripe
and
stimulating
flavor
or
indeed
toward
any
other
describable
goal
one
sees
is
simply
a
general
irresolution
a
pervasive
superficiality
there
is
no
sober
grappling
with
fundamentals
but
only
a
shy
sporting
on
the
surface
there
is
not
even
any
serious
approach
such
as
whitman
dreamed
of
to
the
special
experiences
and
emergencies
of
the
american
people
when
one
turns
to
any
other
national
literature
to
russian
literature
say
or
french
or
german
or
scandinavian
one
is
conscious
immediately
of
a
definite
attitude
toward
the
primary
mysteries
of
existence
the
unsolved
and
problems
at
the
bottom
of
human
life
and
of
a
definite
preoccupation
with
some
of
them
and
a
definite
way
of
translating
their
challenge
into
drama
these
attitudes
and
preoccupations
raise
a
literature
above
mere
poetizing
and
they
give
it
dignity
and
importance
above
all
they
give
it
national
character
but
it
is
precisely
here
that
the
literature
of
america
and
especially
the
later
literature
is
most
colorless
and
inconsequential
as
if
paralyzed
by
the
national
fear
of
ideas
the
democratic
distrust
of
whatever
strikes
beneath
the
prevailing
platitudes
it
evades
all
resolute
and
honest
dealing
with
what
after
all
must
be
every
healthy
literature
elementary
materials
one
is
conscious
of
no
brave
and
noble
earnestness
in
it
of
no
generalized
passion
for
intellectual
and
spiritual
adventure
of
no
organized
determination
to
think
things
out
what
is
there
is
a
highly
and
insipid
correctness
a
bloodless
respectability
a
submergence
of
matter
in
manner
in
brief
what
is
there
is
the
feeble
uninspiring
quality
of
german
painting
and
english
music
it
was
so
in
the
great
days
and
it
is
so
there
has
always
been
hope
and
there
has
always
been
failure
even
the
most
optimistic
prophets
of
future
glories
have
been
united
at
all
times
in
their
discontent
with
the
here
and
now
the
mind
of
this
country
said
emerson
speaking
of
what
was
currently
visible
in
is
taught
to
aim
at
low
objects
there
is
no
work
for
any
but
the
decorous
and
the
complaisant
books
are
written
by
men
of
talent
who
start
wrong
who
set
out
from
accepted
dogmas
not
from
their
own
sight
of
principles
and
then
turning
to
the
way
out
the
office
of
the
scholar
of
whitman
is
to
cheer
to
raise
and
to
guide
men
by
showing
them
amid
whitman
himself
a
full
generation
later
found
that
office
still
unfilled
our
fundamental
want
in
the
united
states
he
said
with
closest
amplest
reference
to
present
conditions
and
to
the
future
is
of
a
class
and
the
clear
idea
of
a
class
of
native
authors
literatuses
far
different
far
higher
in
grade
than
any
yet
known
and
so
on
as
i
have
already
quoted
him
and
finally
to
make
an
end
of
the
prophets
there
is
brooks
with
of
his
book
given
over
not
to
his
prophecy
it
is
crowded
indeed
into
the
last
few
pages
but
to
a
somewhat
heavy
mourning
over
the
actual
scene
before
him
on
the
side
of
letters
the
æsthetic
side
the
side
of
ideas
we
present
to
the
world
at
large
he
says
the
spectacle
of
a
vast
undifferentiated
herd
of
animals
knights
of
pythias
presbyterians
standard
model
readers
of
the
evening
post
admirers
of
richard
harding

and

children
of
god
poe
i
pass
over
i
shall
turn
to
him
again
later
on
nor
shall
i
repeat
the
parrotings
of
emerson
and
whitman
in
the
jeremiads
of
their
innumerable
heirs
and
assigns
what
they
all
establish
is
what
is
already
obvious
that
american
thinking
when
it
concerns
itself
with
beautiful
letters
as
when
it
concerns
itself
with
religious
dogma
or
political
theory
is
extraordinarily
timid
and
superficial
that
it
evades
the
genuinely
serious
problems
of
life
and
art
as
if
they
were
stringently
taboo
that
the
outward
virtues
it
undoubtedly
shows
are
always
the
virtues
not
of
profundity
not
of
courage
not
of
originality
but
merely
those
of
an
emasculated
and
often
very
trashy
dilettantism
ashes
of
new
the
current
scene
is
surely
depressing
enough
what
one
observes
is
a
literature
in
three
layers
and
each
inordinately
doughy
and
uninspiring
each
almost
without
flavor
or
savor
it
is
hard
to
say
with
much
critical
plausibility
which
layer
deserves
to
be
called
the
upper
but
for
decorum
sake
the
choice
may
be
fixed
upon
that
which
meets
with
the
approval
of
the
reigning
lessings
this
is
the
layer
of
the
novels
of
the
late
howells
judge
grant
alice
brown
and
the
rest
of
the
dwindling
survivors
of
new
england
of
the
brittle
academic
poetry
of
woodberry
and
the
elder
johnson
of
the
essays
of
crothers
miss
repplier
and
company
and
of
the
solemn
highly
judicial
coroner
inquest
criticism
of
more
brownell
babbitt
and
their
imitators
here
we
have
manner
undoubtedly
the
thing
is
correctly
done
it
is
never
crude
or
gross
there
is
in
it
a
faint
perfume
of
society
but
when
this
highly
refined
and
attenuated
manner
is
allowed
for
what
remains
is
next
to
nothing
one
never
remembers
a
character
in
the
novels
of
these
aloof
and
americans
one
never
encounters
an
idea
in
their
essays
one
never
carries
away
a
line
out
of
their
poetry
it
is
literature
as
an
academic
exercise
for
talented
grammarians
almost
as
a
genteel
recreation
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
fashion
the
exact
equivalent
in
the
field
of
letters
of
eighteenth
century
painting
and
german
what
ails
it
intrinsically
is
a
dearth
of
intellectual
audacity
and
of
æsthetic
passion
running
through
it
and
characterizing
the
work
of
almost
every
man
and
woman
producing
it
there
is
an
unescapable
suggestion
of
the
old
puritan
suspicion
of
the
fine
arts
as
such
of
the
doctrine
that
they
offer
fit
asylum
for
good
citizens
only
when
some
ulterior
and
superior
purpose
is
carried
into
them
this
purpose
naturally
enough
most
commonly
shows
a
moral
tinge
the
aim
of
poetry
it
appears
is
to
fill
the
mind
with
lofty
thoughts
not
to
give
it
joy
but
to
give
it
a
grand
and
somewhat
gaudy
sense
of
virtue
the
essay
is
a
weapon
against
the
degenerate
tendencies
of
the
age
the
novel
properly
conceived
is
a
means
of
uplifting
the
spirit
its
aim
is
to
inspire
not
merely
to
satisfy
the
low
curiosity
of
man
in
man
the
puritan
of
course
is
not
entirely
devoid
of
æsthetic
feeling
he
has
a
taste
for
good
form
he
responds
to
style
he
is
even
capable
of
something
approaching
a
purely
æsthetic
emotion
but
he
fears
this
æsthetic
emotion
as
an
insinuating
distraction
from
his
chief
business
in
life
the
sober
consideration
of
the
problem
of
conduct
art
is
a
temptation
a
seduction
a
lorelei
and
the
good
man
may
safely
have
traffic
with
it
only
when
it
is
broken
to
moral
uses
in
other
words
when
its
innocence
is
pumped
out
of
it
and
it
is
purged
of
gusto
it
is
precisely
this
gusto
that
one
misses
in
all
the
work
of
the
new
england
school
and
in
all
the
work
of
the
formal
schools
that
derive
from
it
one
observes
in
such
a
fellow
as
henry
van
dyke
an
excellent
specimen
of
the
whole
clan
he
is
in
his
way
a
genuine
artist
he
has
a
hand
for
pretty
verses
he
wields
a
facile
rhetoric
he
shows
in
indiscreet
moments
a
touch
of
imagination
but
all
the
while
he
remains
a
sound
presbyterian
with
one
eye
on
the
devil
he
is
a
presbyterian
first
and
an
artist
second
which
is
just
as
comfortable
as
trying
to
be
a
presbyterian
first
and
a
chorus
girl
second
to
such
a
man
it
must
inevitably
appear
that
a
molière
a
wagner
a
goethe
or
a
shakespeare
was
more
than
a
little
bawdy
the
criticism
that
supports
this
decaying
caste
of
literary
brahmins
is
grounded
almost
entirely
upon
ethical
criteria
you
will
spend
a
long
while
going
through
the
works
of
such
typical
professors
as
more
phelps
boynton
burton
perry
brownell
and
babbitt
before
ever
you
encounter
a
purely
æsthetic
judgment
upon
an
æsthetic
question
it
is
almost
as
if
a
man
estimating
daffodils
should
do
it
in
terms
of
artichokes
phelps
whole
body
of
we
criticism
the
most
catholic
and
tolerant
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
the
faculty
can
show
consists
chiefly
of
a
plea
for
correctness
and
particularly
for
moral
correctness
he
never
gets
very
far
from
the
axiom
of
the
moral
law
brownell
argues
eloquently
for
standards
that
would
bind
an
imaginative
author
as
tightly
as
a
is
bound
by
the
ten
commandments
and
the
mann
act
sherman
tries
to
save
shakespeare
for
the
by
proving
that
he
was
an
iowa
methodist
a
member
of
his
local
chamber
of
commerce
a
contemner
of
reds
an
advocate
of
democracy
and
the
league
of
nations
a
patriotic
during
the
armada
scare
elmer
more
devotes
himself
year
in
and
year
out
to
denouncing
the
romantic
movement
the
effort
to
emancipate
the
artist
from
formulæ
and
categories
and
so
make
him
free
to
dance
with
arms
and
legs
and
babbitt
to
make
an
end
gives
over
his
days
and
his
nights
to
deploring
anarchistic
abrogation
of
the
veto
power
over
the
imagination
leading
to
such
wrongness
in
both
art
and
life
that
it
threatens
to
wreck
civilization
in
brief
the
alarms
of
schoolmasters
not
many
of
them
deal
specifically
with
the
literature
that
is
in
being
it
is
too
near
to
be
quite
nice
to
more
or
babbitt
only
death
can
atone
for
the
primary
offense
of
the
artist
but
what
they
preach
nevertheless
has
its
echoes
contemporaneously
and
those
echoes
in
the
main
are
woefully
falsetto
i
often
wonder
what
sort
of
picture
of
these
states
is
conjured
up
by
foreigners
who
read
say
crothers
van
dyke
babbitt
the
later
winston
churchill
and
the
old
maids
of
the
freudian
suppression
school
how
can
such
a
foreigner
moving
in
those
damp
asthmatic
mists
imagine
such
phenomena
as
roosevelt
billy
sunday
bryan
the
becker
case
the
newport
palm
beach
the
university
of
chicago
chicago
itself
the
whole
gross
glittering
excessively
dynamic
infinitely
grotesque
incredibly
stupendous
drama
of
american
life
as
i
have
said
it
is
not
often
that
the
deign
to
notice
contemporary
writers
even
of
their
own
austere
kidney
in
all
the
shelburne
essays
there
is
none
on
howells
or
on
churchill
or
on
wharton
more
seems
to
think
of
american
literature
as
expiring
with
longfellow
and
donald
mitchell
he
has
himself
hinted
that
in
the
department
of
criticism
of
criticism
there
enters
into
the
matter
something
beyond
mere
aloof
ignorance
i
soon
learned
as
editor
of
the
he
says
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
get
fair
consideration
for
a
book
written
by
a
scholar
not
connected
with
a
university
from
a
reviewer
so
connected
this
class
consciousness
however
should
not
apply
to
artists
who
are
admittedly
inferior
to
professors
and
it
surely
does
not
show
itself
in
such
men
as
phelps
and
spingarn
who
seem
to
be
very
eager
to
prove
that
they
are
not
professorial
yet
phelps
in
the
course
of
a
long
work
on
the
novel
pointedly
omits
all
mention
of
such
men
as
dreiser
and
spingarn
as
the
aforesaid
brooks
has
said
appears
to
be
less
inclined
even
than
the
critics
with
whom
he
is
theoretically
at
war
to
play
an
active
public
part
in
the
secular
conflict
of
darkness
and
light
when
one
comes
to
the
there
is
less
remoteness
but
what
takes
the
place
of
it
is
almost
as
saddening
to
sherman
and
percy
boynton
the
one
aim
of
criticism
seems
to
be
the
enforcement
of
correctness
in
emerson
phrase
the
upholding
of
some
great
decorum
some
fetish
of
a
government
some
ephemeral
trade
or
war
or
man
puritanism
democracy
monogamy
the
league
of
nations
the
wilsonian
piffle
even
among
the
critics
who
escape
the
worst
of
this
schoolmastering
frenzy
there
is
some
touch
of
the
heavy
culture
of
the
provincial
schoolma
for
example
consider
clayton
hamilton
of
the
national
institute
of
arts
and
letters
here
are
the
tests
he
proposes
for
dramatic
critics
for
gentlemen
chiefly
employed
in
reviewing
such
characteristic
american
compositions
as
the
ziegfeld
follies
up
in
mabel
room
and
the
witching
hour
have
you
ever
stood
bareheaded
in
the
nave
of
amiens
have
you
ever
climbed
to
the
acropolis
by
moonlight
have
you
ever
walked
with
whispers
into
the
hushed
presence
of
the
frari
madonna
of
bellini
what
could
more
brilliantly
evoke
an
image
of
the
eternal
miss
birch
blue
veil
flying
and
baedeker
in
hand
plodding
along
faithfully
through
the
interminable
corridors
and
catacombs
of
the
louvre
the
while
bands
are
playing
across
the
river
and
young
bucks
in
hats
are
sparking
the
gals
and
the
jews
and
harlots
uphold
the
traditions
of
french
at
longchamps
and
american
deacons
are
frisked
and
debauched
up
on
martyrs
hill
the
banality
of
it
is
really
too
exquisite
to
be
borne
the
lack
of
humor
is
almost
that
of
a
fifth
avenue
divine
one
seldom
finds
in
the
pronunciamentoes
of
these
dogged
professors
indeed
any
trace
of
either
attic
or
gallic
salt
when
they
essay
to
be
jocose
the
result
is
usually
simply
an
elephantine
whimsicality
by
the
chautauqua
out
of
the
their
satire
is
mere
one
finds
it
difficult
to
believe
that
they
have
ever
read
lewes
or
hazlitt
or
above
all
saintsbury
i
often
wonder
in
fact
how
saintsbury
would
fare
an
unknown
man
at
the
hands
of
say
brownell
or
more
what
of
his
iconoclastic
gayety
his
boyish
weakness
for
tweaking
noses
and
pulling
whiskers
his
obscene
delight
in
slang
ferment
so
much
for
the
top
layer
the
bottom
layer
is
given
over
to
the
literature
of
greenwich
village
and
by
greenwich
village
of
course
i
mean
the
whole
of
the
advanced
wing
in
letters
whatever
the
scene
of
its
solemn
declarations
of
independence
and
forlorn
hopes

the
busiest
of
all

the
most
interesting
what
lies
under
the
whole
movement
is
the
natural
revolt
of
youth
against
the
pedagogical
prussianism
of
the
professors
the
oppression
is
extreme
and
so
the
rebellion
is
extreme
imagine
a
sentimental
young
man
of
the
provinces
awaking
one
morning
to
the
somewhat
startling
discovery
that
he
is
full
of
the
divine
afflatus
and
nominated
by
the
hierarchy
of
hell
to
enrich
the
literature
of
his
fatherland
he
seeks
counsel
and
aid
he
finds
on
consulting
the
official
treatises
on
that
literature
that
its
greatest
poet
was
longfellow
he
is
warned
reading
more
and
babbitt
that
the
literatus
who
lets
feeling
get
into
his
compositions
is
a
psychic
fornicator
and
under
german
influences
he
has
formal
notice
from
sherman
that
puritanism
is
the
lawful
philosophy
of
the
country
and
that
any
dissent
from
it
is
treason
he
gets
the
news
plowing
through
the
new
york
book
review
the
so
far
to
the
left
in
its
politics
but
hugging
the
right
so
desperately
in
letters
the
the
and
the
rest
that
the
salient
artists
of
the
living
generation
are
such
masters
as
robert
underwood
johnson
owen
wister
james
lane
allen
george
woodberry
hamlin
garland
william
roscoe
thayer
and
augustus
thomas
with
polite
bows
to
margaret
deland
mary
johnston
and
ellen
glasgow
it
slowly
dawns
upon
him
that
robert
chambers
is
an
academician
and
theodore
dreiser
is
that
brian
hooker
is
and
george
sterling
is
that
henry
sydnor
harrison
is
and
james
branch
cabell
is
that
chimmie
fadden
townsend
is
and
sherwood
anderson
is
is
it
any
wonder
that
such
a
young
fellow
after
one
or
two
sniffs
of
that
fog
swings
so
vastly
backward
that
one
finds
him
presently
in
corduroy
trousers
and
a
velvet
jacket
hammering
furiously
upon
a
pine
table
in
a
macdougal
street
cellar
his
mind
full
of
malicious
animal
magnetism
against
even
so
amiable
an
old
maid
as
howells
and
his
discourse
full
of
insane
about
libre
futurism
spectrism
vorticism
héliogabalisme
the
thing
in
truth
is
in
the
course
of
nature
the
spaniards
who
were
outraged
by
the
palmerism
of
torquemada
did
not
become
members
of
the
church
of
england
they
became
atheists
the
american
colonists
in
revolt
against
a
bad
king
did
not
set
up
a
good
king
they
set
up
a
democracy
and
so
gave
every
honest
man
a
chance
to
become
a
rogue
on
his
own
account
thus
the
young
literatus
emerging
from
the
vacuum
of
ohio
or
arkansas
an
early
success
as
we
shall
see
tends
to
halt
and
moderate
him
he
finds
that
after
all
there
is
still
a
place
for
him
a
sort
of
asylum
for
such
as
he
not
or
very
but
nevertheless
quite
real
but
if
his
sledding
at
the
start
is
hard
if
the
corrective
birch
finds
him
while
he
is
still
tender
then
he
goes
as
andrew
jackson
would
say
the
whole
hog
and
another
voice
is
added
to
the
raucous
bellowing
of
the
literary
reds
i
confess
that
the
spectacle
gives
me
some
joy
despite
the
fact
that
the
actual
output
of
the
village
is
seldom
worth
noticing
what
commonly
engulfs
and
spoils
the
villagers
is
their
concern
with
mere
technique
among
them
it
goes
without
saying
are
a
great
many
frauds
poets
whose
yearning
to
write
is
unaccompanied
by
anything
properly
describable
as
capacity
dramatists
whose
dramas
are
simply
schnitzler
and
workers
in
prose
fiction
who
gravitate
swiftly
and
inevitably
to
the
merchandise
of
the
cheap
magazines
in
brief
american
equivalents
of
the
bogus
painters
of
the
boul
mich
these
pretenders
having
no
ideas
naturally
try
to
make
the
most
of
forms
half
the
wars
in
the
village
are
over
form
content
is
taken
for
granted
or
forgotten
altogether
the
extreme
leftists
in
fact
descend
to
a
meaningless
gibberish
both
in
prose
and
in
verse
it
is
their
last
defiance
to
intellectualism
this
childish
concentration
upon
externals
unfortunately
tends
to
debauch
the
small
minority
that
is
of
more
or
less
genuine
parts
the
good
are
pulled
in
by
the
bad
as
a
result
the
village
produces
nothing
that
justifies
all
the
noise
it
makes
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
a
book
coming
out
of
it
or
a
short
story
of
arresting
quality
or
even
a
poem
of
any
solid
distinction
as
one
of
the
editors
of
a
magazine
which
specializes
in
the
work
of
new
authors
i
am
in
an
exceptional
position
to
report
probably
of
the
stuff
written
in
the
dark
dens
and
alleys
south
of
the
arch
comes
to
my
desk
soon
or
late
and
i
go
through
all
of
it
faithfully
it
is
in
the
overwhelming
main
jejune
and
imitative
the
prose
is
quite
without
distinction
either
in
matter
or
in
manner
the
verse
seldom
gets
beyond
a
hollow
audaciousness
not
unlike
that
of
cubist
painting
it
is
not
often
indeed
that
even
personality
is
in
it
all
of
the
villagers
seem
to
write
alike
unless
one
is
an
expert
in
some
detective
method
said
a
recent
writer
in
one
is
at
a
loss
to
assign
correctly
the
ownership
of
much
free
verse
that
is
if
one
plays
fairly
and
refuses
to
look
at
the
signature
until
one
has
ventured
a
guess
it
is
difficult
for
instance
to
know
whether
miss
lowell
is
writing
bynner
verse
or
whether
he
is
writing
hers
moreover
this
monotony
keeps
to
a
very
low
level
there
is
no
poet
in
the
movement
who
has
produced
anything
even
remotely
approaching
the
fine
lyrics
of
miss
reese
miss
teasdale
and
john
mcclure
and
for
all
its
war
upon
the
it
can
show
nothing
to
equal
the
beauty
of
robert
loveman
rain
song
in
the
drama
the
village
has
gone
further
in
eugene
rita
wellman
and
zoë
akins
it
offers
dramatists
who
are
obviously
many
cuts
above
the
mechanicians
who
pour
out
of
baker
at
cambridge
but
here
we
must
probably
give
the
credit
not
to
any
influence
residing
within
the
movement
itself
but
to
mere
acts
of
god
such
pieces
as
miss
wellman
the
gentile
wife
and
miss
akins
extraordinary
papa
lie
quite
outside
the
village
scheme
of
things
there
is
no
sign
of
formal
revolt
in
them
they
are
simply
work
done
miraculously
in
a
land
but
if
the
rebellion
is
thus
sterile
of
direct
results
and
in
more
than
one
aspect
fraudulent
and
ridiculous
it
is
at
all
events
an
evidence
of
something
not
to
be
disregarded
and
that
something
is
the
gradual
formulation
of
a
challenge
to
the
accepted
canons
in
letters
and
to
the
accepted
canon
lawyers
the
first
hoots
come
from
a
tatterdemalion
horde
of
rogues
and
vagabonds
without
the
gates
but
soon
or
late
let
us
hope
they
will
be
echoed
in
more
decorous
quarters
and
with
much
greater
effect
the
village
in
brief
is
an
earnest
that
somewhere
or
other
new
seeds
are
germinating
between
the
young
tutor
who
launches
into
letters
with
imitations
of
his
seminary
chief
imitations
of
agnes
repplier
imitations
of
charles
lamb
and
the
young
peasant
who
tries
to
get
his
honest
exultations
into
free
verse
there
can
be
no
hesitant
choice
the
peasant
is
by
long
odds
the
sounder
artist
and
what
is
more
the
sounder
american
artist
even
the
shy
and
somewhat
stagey
carnality
that
characterizes
the
village
has
its
high
symbolism
and
its
profound
uses
it
proves
that
despite
repressions
unmatched
in
civilization
in
modern
times
there
is
still
a
sturdy
animality
in
american
youth
and
hence
good
health
the
poet
hugging
his
sonia
in
a
washington
square
beanery
and
so
giving
notice
to
all
his
world
that
he
is
a
devil
of
a
fellow
is
at
least
a
better
man
than
the
emasculated
stripling
in
a
pumped
dry
of
all
his
natural
appetites
and
the
vacuum
filled
with
business
economics
and
in
so
foul
a
nest
of
imprisoned
and
fermenting
sex
as
the
united
states
plain
fornication
becomes
a
mark
of
relative
decency
the
literary
but
the
theme
is
letters
not
wickedness
the
upper
and
lower
layers
have
been
surveyed
there
remains
the
middle
layer
the
thickest
and
perhaps
the
most
significant
of
the
three
by
the
middle
layer
i
mean
the
literature
that
fills
the
magazines
and
burdens
the
in
the
the
literature
adorned
by
such
artists
as
richard
harding
davis
rex
beach
emerson
hough
henry
james
whitcomb
riley
augustus
thomas
robert
chambers
henry
sydnor
harrison
owen
johnson
cyrus
townsend
brady
irvin
cobb
and
mary
roberts
rinehart
in
brief
the
literature
that
pays
like
a
or
a
and
is
thus
thoroughly
american
at
the
bottom
this
literature
touches
such
depths
of
banality
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
match
it
in
any
other
country
the
inspirational
and
patriotic
essays
of
frank
crane
orison
sweet
marden
porter
emerson
browne
gerald
stanley
lee
martin
ella
wheeler
wilcox
and
the
rev
newell
dwight
hillis
the
novels
of
harold
bell
wright
eleanor
porter
and
gene
and
the
mechanical
sentimentalities
in
prose
and
verse
that
fill
the
cheap
fiction
magazines
this
stuff
has
a
native
quality
that
is
as
unmistakable
as
that
of
mother
day
or
the
junior
order
of
united
american
mechanics
it
is
the
natural
outpouring
of
a
naïve
and
yet
half
barbarous
people
full
of
delight
in
a
few
childish
and
inaccurate
ideas
but
it
would
be
a
grave
error
to
assume
that
the
whole
of
the
literature
of
the
middle
layer
is
of
the
same
infantile
quality
on
the
contrary
a
great
deal
of
it
for
example
the
work
of
rinehart
and
that
of
corra
harris
gouverneur
morris
harold
macgrath
and
the
late
henry
shows
an
unmistakably
technical
excellence
and
even
a
certain
civilized
sophistication
in
point
of
view
moreover
this
literature
is
constantly
graduating
adept
professors
into
something
finer
as
witness
booth
tarkington
zona
gale
ring
lardner
and
montague
glass
clemens
came
out
of
forty
years
ago
nevertheless
its
general
tendency
is
distinctly
in
the
other
direction
it
seduces
by
the
power
of
money
and
by
the
power
of
great
acclaim
no
less
one
constantly
observes
the
collapse
and
surrender
of
writers
who
started
out
with
aims
far
above
that
of
the
magazine
nabob
i
could
draw
up
a
long
long
list
of
such
victims
henry
milner
rideout
jack
london
owen
johnson
chester
bailey
fernald
hamlin
garland
will
levington
comfort
stephen
french
whitman
james
hopper
harry
leon
wilson
and
so
on
they
had
their
in
the
last
generation
in
bret
harte
it
is
indeed
a
characteristic
american
phenomenon
for
a
young
writer
to
score
a
success
with
novel
and
meritorious
work
and
then
to
yield
himself
to
the
fever
and
so
disappear
down
the
sewers
even
the
man
who
struggles
to
emerge
again
is
commonly
hauled
back
for
example
louis
joseph
vance
rupert
hughes
george
and
to
go
back
a
few
years
david
graham
phillips
and
elbert
hubbard
all
men
flustered
by
high
aspiration
and
yet
all
pulled
down
by
the
temptations
below
even
frank
norris
showed
signs
of
yielding
the
pull
is
genuinely
powerful
above
lies
not
only
isolation
but
also
a
dogged
and
malignant
sort
of
opposition
below
as
morris
has
frankly
admitted
there
is
the
place
at
aiken
the
babies
money
in
the
bank
and
the
dignity
of
an
important
man
it
is
a
commonplace
of
the
envious
to
put
all
the
blame
upon
the
evening
post
for
in
its
pages
many
of
the
magdalens
of
letters
are
to
be
found
and
out
of
its
bulging
coffers
comes
much
of
the
lure
but
this
is
simply
blaming
the
bull
for
the
sins
of
all
the
cows
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
a
good
deal
less
guilty
than
such
magazines
as
the
hearst
and
the
not
to
mention
the
larger
women
magazines
in
the
one
often
discerns
an
effort
to
rise
above
the
level
of
fiction
it
is
edited
by
a
man
who
almost
alone
among
editors
of
the
great
periodicals
of
the
country
is
himself
a
writer
of
respectable
skill
it
has
brought
out
after
lesser
publications
unearthed
them
a
member
of
authors
of
very
solid
talents
notably
glass
lardner
and
howe
it
has
been
extremely
hospitable
to
men
not
immediately
comprehensible
to
the
mob
for
example
dreiser
and
hergesheimer
most
of
all
it
has
avoided
the
exploitation
of
such
native
as
crane
hillis
and
ella
wheeler
wilcox
and
of
such
exotic
mountebanks
as
hall
caine
and
maeterlinck
in
brief
the
is
a
great
deal
better
than
ever
greenwich
village
and
the
cambridge
campus
are
disposed
to
admit
it
is
the
largest
of
all
the
literary
hog
islands
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
worst
appealing
primarily
to
the
great
masses
of
and
unintelligent
americans
it
must
necessarily
print
a
great
deal
of
preposterous
tosh
but
it
flavors
the
mess
with
not
a
few
things
of
a
far
higher
quality
and
at
its
worst
it
is
seldom
downright
idiotic
in
many
of
the
other
great
magazines
one
finds
stuff
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
in
any
other
words
it
is
gaudily
romantic
furtively
sexual
and
full
of
situations
and
personages
a
sort
of
amalgam
of
the
worst
drivel
of
marie
corelli
elinor
glyn
phillips
oppenheim
william
le
quex
and
hall
caine
this
is
the
literature
of
the
middle
layer
the
product
of
the
national
rockefellers
and
duponts
of
letters
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
young
author
of
facile
pen
is
encouraged
to
manufacture
this
is
the
material
of
the
best
sellers
and
the
movies
of
late
it
is
the
movies
that
have
chiefly
provoked
its
composition
the
rewards
they
offer
are
even
greater
than
those
held
out
by
the
commercial
and
the
magazines
the
point
of
view
of
an
author
responsive
to
such
rewards
was
recently
set
forth
very
naively
in
the
league
this
author
undertook
in
a
short
article
to
refute
the
fallacies
of
an
unknown
who
ventured
to
protest
against
the
movies
on
the
ground
that
they
called
only
for
bald
plots
elementary
and
generally
absurd
and
that
all
the
rest
of
a
sound
writer
equipment
the
artistry
of
his
style
the
felicity
of
his
apt
expression
his
subtlety
and
thoroughness
of
observation
and
comprehension
and
sympathy
the
illuminating
quality
of
his
analysis
of
motive
and
character
even
the
fundamental
skillful
development
of
the
bare
plot
was
disdained
by
the
selznicks
goldfishes
zukors
and
other
such
and
by
the
overwhelming
majority
of
their
customers
i
quote
from
the
reply
there
are
some
conspicuous
word
merchants
who
deal
in
the
english
language
but
the
general
public
does
clamor
for
their
wares
they
write
for
the
thinking
class
the
élite
the
discriminating
as
a
rule
they
scorn
the
crass
commercialism
of
the
magazines
and
movies
and
such
devices
however
literary
masterpieces
live
because
they
have
been
and
will
be
read
not
by
the
few
but
by
the
many
that
was
true
in
the
time
of
homer
and
even
the
first
move
made
by
an
editor
when
he
receives
a
manuscript
or
a
gentle
reader
when
he
buys
a
book
or
a
when
he
sinks
into
an
orchestra
chair
is
to
look
around
for
john
henry
plot
if
mr
plot
is
too
long
delayed
in
arriving
or
does
come
at
all
the
editor
usually
sends
regrets
the
reader
yawns
and
the
tired
business
man
falls
asleep
it
a
sad
state
of
affairs
and
awful
tough
on
art
but
it
ca
be
helped
observe
the
lofty
scorn
of
mere
literature
the
superior
irony
at
the
expense
of
everything
beyond
the
bumping
of
boobs
note
the
sound
judgment
as
to
the
function
and
fate
of
literary
masterpieces
endymion
the
canterbury
tales
faust
typhoon
give
your
eye
to
the
chaste
diction
john
henry
plot
awful
tough
and
so
on
no
doubt
you
will
at
once
assume
that
this
curious
counterblast
to
literature
was
written
by
some
former
bartender
now
engaged
in
composing
scenarios
for
pearl
white
and
theda
bara
but
it
was
not
it
was
written
and
signed
by
the
president
of
the
league
of
america
here
we
have
unconsciously
revealed
the
secret
of
the
depressing
badness
of
what
may
be
called
the
staple
fiction
of
the
country
the
sort
of
stuff
that
is
done
by
the
richard
harding
davises
rex
beaches
houghs
mccutcheons
and
their
like
male
and
female
the
worse
of
it
is
not
that
it
is
addressed
primarily
to
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
is
written
by
authors
who
to
all
intellectual
intents
and
purposes
and
american
literature
even
on
its
higher
levels
seldom
comes
out
of
the
small
and
lonesome
upper
classes
of
the
people
an
american
author
with
traditions
behind
him
and
an
environment
about
him
comparable
to
those
say
of
george
moore
or
hugh
walpole
or
benson
is
and
always
has
been
relatively
rare
on
this
side
of
the
water
the
arts
like
politics
and
religion
are
chiefly
in
the
keeping
of
persons
of
obscure
origin
defective
education
and
elemental
tastes
even
some
of
the
most
violent
upholders
of
the
new
england
superstition
are
aliens
to
the
actual
new
england
heritage
one
discovers
searching
who
who
in
america
that
they
are
recent
fugitives
from
the
sock
and
saleratus
of
the
cow
and
hog
states
the
artistic
merchandise
produced
by
liberated
yokels
of
that
sort
is
bound
to
show
its
intellectual
newness
which
is
to
say
its
deficiency
in
civilized
culture
and
sophistication
it
is
on
the
plane
of
letters
precisely
what
evangelical
christianity
is
on
the
plane
of
religion
to
wit
the
product
of
emotional
and
more
or
less
pushing
and
oafish
folk
life
to
such
harvardized
peasants
is
not
a
mystery
it
is
something
absurdly
simple
to
be
described
with
surety
and
in
a
few
words
if
they
set
up
as
critics
their
criticism
is
all
a
matter
of
facile
labeling
chiefly
ethical
find
the
and
the
rest
is
easy
if
they
presume
to
discuss
the
great
problems
of
human
society
they
are
equally
ready
with
their
answers
draw
up
and
pass
a
harsh
enough
statute
and
the
corruptible
will
straightway
put
on
incorruption
and
if
fanned
by
the
soft
breath
of
beauty
they
go
into
practice
as
creative
artists
as
poets
as
dramatists
as
novelists
then
one
learns
from
them
that
we
inhabit
a
country
that
is
the
model
and
despair
of
other
states
that
its
culture
is
coextensive
with
human
culture
and
enlightenment
and
that
every
failure
to
find
happiness
under
that
culture
is
the
result
of
sin
here
is
one
of
the
fundamental
defects
of
american
fiction
perhaps
the
one
character
that
sets
it
off
sharply
from
all
other
known
kinds
of
contemporary
fiction
it
habitually
exhibits
not
a
man
of
delicate
organization
in
revolt
against
the
inexplicable
tragedy
of
existence
but
a
man
of
low
sensibilities
and
elemental
desires
yielding
himself
gladly
to
his
environment
and
so
achieving
what
under
a
civilization
passes
for
success
to
get
on
this
is
the
aim
to
weigh
and
reflect
to
doubt
and
rebel
this
is
the
thing
to
be
avoided
i
describe
the
optimistic
the
inspirational
the
authors
league
the
popular
magazine
the
peculiarly
american
school
in
character
creation
its
masterpiece
is
the
advertising
agent
who
by
devising
some
new
and
puts
his
factory
on
the
map
ruins
all
other
factories
marries
the
daughter
of
his
boss
and
so
ends
as
an
eminent
man
obviously
the
drama
underlying
such
fiction
what
beach
would
call
its
john
henry
plot
is
false
drama
drama
puerile
and
disgusting
drama
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
awakens
a
response
only
in
men
who
are
essentially
unimaginative
timorous
and
degraded
in
brief
in
democrats
bagmen
yahoos
the
man
of
reflective
habit
can
not
conceivably
take
any
passionate
interest
in
the
conflicts
it
deals
with
he
does
want
to
marry
the
daughter
of
the
owner
of
the
factory
he
would
probably
burn
down
the
factory
itself
if
it
ever
came
into
his
hands
what
interests
this
man
is
the
far
more
poignant
and
significant
conflict
between
a
salient
individual
and
the
harsh
and
meaningless
fiats
of
destiny
the
unintelligible
mandates
and
vagaries
of
god
his
hero
is
not
one
who
yields
and
wins
but
one
who
resists
and
fails
most
of
these
conflicts
of
course
are
internal
and
hence
do
not
make
themselves
visible
in
the
overt
melodrama
of
the
beaches
davises
and
chamberses
a
superior
man
struggle
in
the
world
is
not
with
exterior
lions
trusts
margraves
policemen
rivals
in
love
german
spies
radicals
and
tornadoes
but
with
the
obscure
atavistic
impulses
within
him
the
impulses
weaknesses
and
limitations
that
war
with
his
notion
of
what
life
should
be
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
succumbs
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
must
yield
to
the
dead
hand
nine
times
out
of
ten
his
aspiration
is
almost
infinitely
above
his
achievement
the
result
is
that
we
see
him
sliding
downhill
his
ideals
breaking
up
his
hope
petering
out
his
character
in
decay
character
in
decay
is
thus
the
theme
of
the
great
bulk
of
superior
fiction
one
has
it
in
dostoievsky
in
balzac
in
hardy
in
conrad
in
flaubert
in
zola
in
turgenieff
in
goethe
in
sudermann
in
bennett
and
to
come
home
in
dreiser
in
nearly
all
novels
the
hero
is
defeated
in
perhaps
a
majority
he
is
completely
destroyed
the
hero
of
the
inferior
the
typically
american
novel
engages
in
no
such
doomed
and
fateful
combat
his
conflict
is
not
with
the
inexplicable
ukases
of
destiny
the
limitations
of
his
own
strength
the
dead
hand
upon
him
but
simply
with
the
superficial
desires
of
his
elemental
fellow
men
he
thus
has
a
fair
chance
of
winning
and
in
bad
fiction
that
chance
is
always
converted
into
a
certainty
so
he
marries
the
daughter
of
the
owner
of
the
factory
and
eventually
gobbles
the
factory
itself
his
success
gives
thrills
to
persons
who
can
imagine
no
higher
aspiration
he
embodies
their
optimism
as
the
other
hero
embodies
the
pessimism
of
more
introspective
and
idealistic
men
he
is
the
protagonist
of
that
great
majority
which
is
so
inferior
that
it
is
quite
unconscious
of
its
inferiority
it
is
this
superficiality
of
the
inferior
man
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
chief
hallmark
of
the
american
novel
whenever
one
encounters
a
novel
that
rises
superior
to
it
the
thing
takes
on
a
subtle
but
unmistakable
air
of
foreignness
for
example
frank
norris
vandover
and
the
brute
hergesheimer
the
lay
anthony
and
miss
my
antonia
or
to
drop
to
short
stories
stephen
crane
the
blue
hotel
and
wharton
ethan
frome
the
short
story
is
commonly
regarded
at
least
by
american
critics
as
a
preëminently
american
form
there
are
even
patriots
who
argue
that
bret
harte
invented
it
it
meets
very
accurately
in
fact
certain
characteristic
demands
of
the
american
temperament
it
is
simple
economical
and
brilliantly
effective
yet
the
same
hollowness
that
marks
the
american
novel
also
marks
the
american
short
story
its
great
masters
in
late
years
have
been
such
as
davis
with
his
romanticism
and
henry
with
his
and
variety
show
smartness
in
the
whole
canon
of
henry
work
you
will
not
find
a
single
recognizable
human
character
his
people
are
unanimously
marionettes
he
makes
mexican
brigands
texas
cowmen
and
new
york
cracksmen
talk
the
same
highly
ornate
broadwayese
the
successive
volumes
of
edward
best
series
throw
a
vivid
light
upon

know
how
to

in
content
their

hollow
as

no

relation

i
have
spoken
of
the
air
of
foreignness
that
clings
to
certain
exceptional
american
compositions
in
part
it
is
based
upon
a
psychological
trick
upon
the
surprise
which
must
inevitably
seize
upon
any
one
who
encounters
a
decent
piece
of
writing
in
so
vast
a
desert
of
mere
literacy
but
in
part
it
is
grounded
soundly
enough
on
the
facts
the
native
author
of
any
genuine
force
and
originality
is
almost
invariably
found
to
be
under
strong
foreign
influences

little
review
the
organ
of
the
extreme
wing
of
is
so
violently
exotic
that
several
years
ago
during
the
plupatriotic
days
of
the
war
some
of
its
readers
protested
with
characteristic
lack
of
humor
it
replied
with
an
american
number
and
two
of
the
stars
of
that
number
bore
the
fine
old
names
of
ben
hecht
and
eisa
von
this
tendency
of
american
literature
the
moment
it
begins
to
show
enterprise
novelty
and
significance
to
radiate
an
alien
smell
is
not
an
isolated
phenomenon
the
same
smell
accompanies
practically
all
other
sorts
of
intellectual
activity
in
the
republic
whenever
one
hears
that
a
new
political
theory
is
in
circulation
or
a
scientific
heresy
or
a
movement
toward
rationalism
in
religion
it
is
always
safe
to
guess
that
some
discontented
stranger
or
other
has
a
hand
in
it
in
the
newspapers
and
on
the
floor
of
congress
a
new
heterodoxy
is
always
denounced
forthwith
as
a
product
of
foreign
plotting
and
here
public
opinion
undoubtedly
supports
both
the
press
and
the
politicians
and
with
good
reason
the
native
culture
of
the
country
that
is
the
culture
of
the
low
caste
who
preserve
the
national
tradition
is
almost
completely
incapable
of
producing
ideas
it
is
a
culture
that
roughly
corresponds
to
what
the
culture
of
england
would
be
if
there
were
no
universities
over
there
and
no
caste
of
intellectual
individualists
and
no
landed
aristocracy
in
other
words
if
the
tone
of
the
national
thinking
were
set
by
the
industrials
the
camorra
of
welsh
and
scotch
political
scoundrels
and
the
town
and
country
mobs
as
we
shall
see
the
united
states
has
not
yet
produced
anything
properly
describable
as
an
aristocracy
and
so
there
is
no
impediment
to
the
domination
of
the
inferior
orders
worse
the
strain
at
the
start
has
tended
to
degenerate
steadily
to
lower
levels
in
new
england
very
markedly
the
result
is
that
there
is
not
only
a
great
dearth
of
ideas
in
the
land
but
also
an
active
and
relentless
hostility
to
ideas
the
chronic
suspiciousness
of
the
inferior
man
here
has
full
play
never
in
modern
history
has
there
been
another
civilization
showing
so
vast
a
body
of
prohibitions
and
repressions
in
both
conduct
and
thought
the
second
result
is
that
intellectual
experimentation
is
chiefly
left
to
the
immigrants
of
the
later
migrations
and
to
the
small
sections
of
the
native
population
that
have
been
enriched
with
their
blood
for
such
a
pure
as
cabell
to
disport
himself
in
the
field
of
ideas
is
a
rarity
in
the
united
states
and
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
i
have
just
mentioned
for
cabell
belongs
to
an
aristocracy
that
is
now
almost
extinct
and
has
no
more
in
common
with
the
general
population
than
a
baltic
baron
has
with
the
indigenous
herd
of
letts
and
esthonians
all
the
arts
in
america
are
thoroughly
exotic
music
is
almost
wholly
german
or
italian
painting
is
french
literature
may
be
anything
from
english
to
russian
architecture
save
when
it
becomes
a
mere
branch
of
engineering
is
a
maddening
phantasmagoria
of
borrowings
even
so
elemental
an
art
as
that
of
cookery
shows
no
native
development
and
is
greatly
disesteemed
by
americans
of
the
majority
any
decent
restaurant
that
one
blunders
upon
in
the
land
is
likely
to
be
french
and
if
not
french
then
italian
or
german
or
chinese
so
with
the
sciences
they
have
scarcely
any
native
development
organized
scientific
research
began
in
the
country
with
the
founding
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
a
bald
imitation
of
the
german
universities
and
long
held
suspect
by
native
opinion
even
after
its
great
success
indeed
there
was
rancorous
hostility
to
its
scheme
of
things
on
chauvinistic
grounds
and
some
years
ago
efforts
were
begun
to
americanize
it
with
the
result
that
it
is
now
sunk
to
the
level
of
princeton
amherst
and
other
such
glorified
and
is
dominated
by
native
savants
who
would
be
laughed
at
in
any
continental
university
science
oppressed
by
such
assaults
from
below
moves
out
of
the
academic
grove
into
the
freer
air
of
the
great
foundations
where
the
pursuit
of
the
shy
fact
is
uncontaminated
by
football
and
social
pushing
the
greatest
of
these
foundations
is
the
rockefeller
institute
its
salient
men
are
such
investigators
as
flexner
loeb
and
carrel
all
of
them
continental
jews
thus
the
battle
of
ideas
in
the
united
states
is
largely
carried
on
under
strange
flags
and
even
the
stray
natives
on
the
side
of
free
inquiry
have
to
sacrifice
some
of
their
nationality
when
they
enlist
the
effects
of
this
curious
condition
of
affairs
are
both
good
and
evil
the
good
ones
are
easily
apparent
the
racial
division
gives
the
struggle
a
certain
desperate
earnestness
and
even
bitterness
and
so
makes
it
the
more
inviting
to
lively
minds
it
was
a
benefit
to
the
late
gilman
rather
than
a
disadvantage
that
national
opinion
opposed
his
traffic
with
huxley
and
the
german
professors
in
the
early
days
of
the
johns
hopkins
the
stupidity
of
the
opposition
stimulated
him
and
made
him
resolute
and
his
resolution
in
the
long
run
was
of
inestimable
cultural
value
scientific
research
in
america
indeed
was
thus
set
securely
upon
its
legs
precisely
because
the
great
majority
of
americans
were
violently
opposed
to
it
in
the
same
way
it
must
be
obvious
that
dreiser
got
something
valuable
out
of
the
grotesque
war
that
was
carried
on
against
him
during
the
greater
war
overseas
because
of
his
german
name
a
fundamentally
responsible
for
the
suppression
of
the
the
chief
danger
that
he
ran
six
or
seven
years
ago
was
the
danger
that
he
might
be
accepted
explained
away
and
so
seduced
downward
to
the
common
level
the
attack
of
professional
patriots
saved
him
from
that
calamity
more
it
filled
him
with
a
keen
sense
of
his
isolation
and
stirred
up
the
vanity
that
was
in
him
as
it
is
in
all
of
us
and
so
made
him
cling
with
new
tenacity
to
the
very
peculiarities
that
differentiate
him
from
his
inferiors
finally
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
without
this
rebellion
of
immigrant
iconoclasts
the
whole
body
of
the
national
literature
would
tend
to
sink
to
the
american
level
of
such
patriotic
literary
business
men
as
the
president
of
the
league
in
other
words
we
must
put
up
with
the
æsthetic
bolshevism
of
the
europeans
and
asiatics
who
rage
in
the
land
for
without
them
we
might
not
have
any
literature
at
all
but
the
evils
of
the
situation
are
not
to
be
gainsaid
one
of
them
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
tendency
of
the
beginning
literatus
once
he
becomes
fully
conscious
of
his
foreign
affiliations
to
desert
the
republic
forthwith
and
thereafter
view
it
from
afar
and
as
an
actual
foreigner
more
solid
and
various
cultures
lure
him
he
finds
himself
uncomfortable
at
home
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
henry
james
he
becomes
a
downright
expatriate
and
a
more
or
less
active
agent
of
feeling
more
often
he
goes
over
to
the
outlanders
without
yielding
up
his
theoretical
citizenship
as
in
the
cases
of
irving
harris
pound
and
but
all
this
of
course
works
relatively
light
damage
for
not
many
native
authors
are
footloose
enough
to
indulge
in
any
such
physical
desertion
of
the
soil
of
much
more
evil
importance
is
the
tendency
of
the
cultural
alienism
that
i
have
described
to
fortify
the
uncontaminated
native
in
his
bilious
suspicion
of
all
the
arts
and
particularly
of
all
artists
the
news
that
the
latest
poet
to
flutter
the
dovecotes
is
a
jew
or
that
the
last
novelist
mauled
by
comstockery
has
a
german
or
scandinavian
or
russian
name
or
that
the
critic
newly
taken
in
sacrilege
is
a
partisan
of
viennese
farce
or
of
the
french
moral
code
or
of
english
literary
theory
this
news
among
a
people
so
so
horribly
in
flight
from
bugaboos
and
so
savagely
suspicious
of
the
unfamiliar
in
ideas
has
the
inevitable
effect
of
stirring
up
opposition
that
quickly
ceases
to
be
purely
æsthetic
objection
and
so
becomes
increasingly
difficult
to
combat
if
dreiser
name
were
tompkins
or
simpson
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
would
affright
the
professors
a
good
deal
less
and
appear
less
of
a
hobgoblin
to
the
of
the
women
clubs
if
oppenheim
were
less
palpably
levantine
he
would
come
much
nearer
to
the
popularity
of
edwin
markham
and
walt
mason
and
if
cabell
kept
to
the
patriotic
business
of
a
southern
gentleman
to
wit
the
praise
of
general
robert
lee
instead
of
prowling
the
strange
and
terrible
fields
of
mediæval
provence
it
is
a
safe
wager
that
he
would
be
sold
openly
over
the
counter
instead
of
stealthily
behind
the
door
in
a
previous
work
i
have
discussed
this
tendency
in
america
to
estimate
the
artist
in
terms
of
his
secular
character
during
the
war
when
all
of
the
national
defects
in
intelligence
were
enormously
accentuated
it
went
to
ludicrous
lengths
there
were
then
only
authors
who
were
vociferous
patriots
and
thus
geniuses
and
authors
who
kept
their
dignity
and
were
thus
suspect
and
without
virtue
by
this
gauge
chambers
became
the
superior
of
dreiser
and
cabell
and
joyce
kilmer
and
amy
lowell
were
set
above
sandburg
and
oppenheim
the
test
was
even
extended
to
foreigners
by
it
wells
took
precedence
of
shaw
and
blasco
ibáñez
became
a
greater
artist
than
romain
rolland
but
the
thing
is
not
peculiar
to
war
times
when
peace
is
densest
it
is
to
be
observed
the
man
of
letters
pure
and
simple
is
a
rarity
in
america
almost
always
he
is
something
else
and
that
something
else
commonly
determines
his
public
eminence
mark
twain
with
only
his
books
to
recommend
him
would
probably
have
passed
into
obscurity
in
middle
age
it
was
in
the
character
of
a
public
entertainer
not
unrelated
to
coxey
mary
walker
and
citizen
george
francis
train
that
he
wooed
and
won
his
country
the
official
criticism
of
the
land
denied
him
any
solid
literary
virtue
to
the
day
of
his
death
and
even
the
campus
critics
and
their
journalistic
valets
stand
aghast
before
the
mysterious
stranger
and
what
is
man
emerson
passed
through
almost
the
same
experience
it
was
not
as
a
man
of
letters
that
he
was
chiefly
thought
of
in
his
time
but
as
the
prophet
of
a
new
cult
half
religious
half
philosophical
and
wholly
unintelligible
to
of
those
who
discussed
it
the
first
author
of
a
handbook
of
american
literature
to
sweep
away
the
codfish
moses
and
expose
the
literary
artist
was
the
polish
jew
leon
kellner
of
czernowitz
so
with
whitman
and
poe
both
hobgoblins
far
more
than
artists
so
even
with
howells
it
was
as
the
exponent
of
a
dying
culture
that
he
was
venerated
not
as
the
practitioner
of
an
art
few
actually
read
his
books
his
celebrity
of
course
was
real
enough
but
it
somehow
differed
materially
from
that
of
a
pure
man
of
letters
say
shelley
conrad
hauptmann
hardy
or
synge
that
he
was
himself
keenly
aware
of
the
national
tendency
to
judge
an
artist
in
terms
of
the
citizen
was
made
plain
at
the
time
of
the
gorky
scandal
when
he
joined
clemens
in
an
ignominious
desertion
of
gorky
scared
out
of
his
wits
by
the
danger
of
being
manhandled
for
a
violation
of
the
national
pecksniffery
howells
also
refused
to
sign
the
dreiser
protest
the
case
of
frank
harris
is
one
eloquently
in
point
harris
has
written
among
other
books
perhaps
the
best
biography
ever
done
by
an
american
yet
his
politics
keep
him
in
a
sort
of
coventry
and
the
average
american
critic
would
no
more
think
of
praising
him
than
of
granting
treitschke
any
merit
as
an
historian
lonesome
thus
falsely
judged
by
standards
that
have
no
intelligible
appositeness
when
applied
to
an
artist
however
accurately
they
may
weigh
a
or
a
presbyterian
elder
and
forced
to
meet
not
only
the
hunkerous
indifference
of
the
dominant
mob
but
also
the
bitter
and
disingenuous
opposition
of
the
classes
to
which
he
might
look
reasonably
for
understanding
and
support
the
american
author
is
forced
into
a
sort
of
social
and
intellectual
vacuum
and
lives
out
his
days
as
henry
james
said
of
hawthorne
an
alien
everywhere
an
æsthetic
solitary
the
wonder
is
that
in
the
face
of
so
metallic
and
unyielding
a
front
any
genuine
artists
in
letters
come
to
the
front
at
all
but
they
constantly
emerge
the
first
gestures
are
always
on
show
the
prodigal
and
gorgeous
life
of
the
country
simply
forces
a
sensitive
minority
to
make
some
attempt
at
representation
and
interpretation
and
out
of
many
trying
there
often
appears
one
who
can
the
phenomenon
of
dreiser
is
not
unique
he
had
his
forerunners
in
fuller
and
frank
norris
and
he
has
his
du
in
anderson
charles
norris
and
more
than
one
other
but
the
fact
only
throws
up
his
curious
isolation
in
a
stronger
light
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
an
artist
of
his
sober
purpose
and
high
accomplishment
in
any
civilized
country
standing
so
neglected
the
prevailing
criticism
when
it
can
not
dispose
of
him
by
denying
that
he
exists
in
the
two
chief
handbooks
of
literature
by
professors
he
is
not
even
mentioned
seeks
to
dispose
of
him
by
arraying
the
shoddy
fury
of
the
mob
against
him
when
he
was
under
attack
by
the
comstocks
more
than
one
american
critic
gave
covert
aid
to
the
common
enemy
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
weight
of
the
authors
league
was
held
upon
his
side
more
help
for
him
in
fact
came
from
england
and
quite
voluntarily
than
could
be
drummed
up
for
him
at
home
no
public
sense
of
the
menace
that
the
attack
offered
to
free
speech
and
free
art
was
visible
it
would
have
made
a
sensation
for
any
layman
of
public
influence
to
have
gone
to
his
rescue
as
would
have
certainly
happened
in
france
england
or
germany
as
for
the
mob
it
probably
went
unaware
of
the
business
altogether
when
arnold
bennett
landing
in
new
york
some
time
previously
told
the
reporters
that
dreiser
was
the
american
he
most
desired
to
meet
the
news
was
quite
unintelligible
to
perhaps
nine
readers
out
of
ten
they
had
no
more
heard
dreiser
than
their
fathers
had
heard
of
whitman
in
so
with
all
the
rest
i
have
mentioned
harris
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
rolland
meeting
such
a
fate
in
france
or
shaw
in
england
as
he
has
met
in
the
united
states
during
the
war
came
home
with
a
good
girl
in
his
pocket
the
book
was
republished
here
and
got
vastly
less
notice
than
the
latest
piece
of
by
kathleen
norris
fuller
early
in
his
career
gave
it
up
as
hopeless
norris
died
vainly
battling
for
the
young
dreiser
an
abraham
cahan
goes
unnoticed
miss
cather
with
four
sound
books
behind
her
lingers
in
the
twilight
of
an
esoteric
reputation
cabell
comstocked
is
apprehended
by
his
country
only
as
a
novelist
to
be
bought
by
stealth
and
read
in
private
when
hugh
walpole
came
to
america
a
year
or
two
ago
he
favored
the
newspapers
like
bennett
before
him
with
a
piece
of
critical
news
that
must
have
puzzled
all
readers
save
a
very
small
minority
discussing
the
living
american
novelists
worth
heeding
he
nominated
three
and
of
them
only
one
was
familiar
to
the
general
run
of
or
had
ever
been
mentioned
by
a
native
critic
of
the
apostolic
succession
only
the
poets
of
the
land
seem
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
professors
and
no
doubt
this
is
largely
because
most
of
the
more
salient
of
them
notably
miss
lowell
and
lindsay
are
primarily
even
so
the
attention
that
they
get
is
seldom
serious
the
only
professor
that
i
know
of
who
has
discussed
the
matter
in
precise
terms
holds
that
alfred
noyes
is
the
superior
of
all
of
them
moreover
the
present
extraordinary
interest
in
poetry
stops
short
with
a
few
poets
and
one
of
its
conspicuous
phenomena
is
its
lack
of
concern
with
the
poets
outside
the
movement
some
of
them
unquestionably
superior
to
any
within
nor
is
this
isolation
of
the
artist
in
america
new
the
contemporary
view
of
poe
and
whitman
was
almost
precisely
like
the
current
view
of
dreiser
and
cabell
both
were
neglected
by
the
brahmins
of
their
time
and
both
were
regarded
hostilely
by
the
great
body
of
citizens
poe
indeed
was
the
victim
of
a
furious
attack
by
rufus
griswold
the
hamilton
wright
mabie
of
the
time
and
it
set
the
tone
of
native
criticism
for
years
whitman
living
narrowly
escaped
going
to
jail
as
a
public
nuisance
one
thinks
of
hawthorne
and
emerson
as
writers
decently
appreciated
by
their
contemporaries
but
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
the
official
criticism
of
the
era
saw
no
essential
difference
between
hawthorne
and
cooper
and
that
reputation
to
the
end
of
his
life
was
far
more
that
of
a
theological
prophet
and
ethical
platitudinarian
comparable
to
lyman
abbott
or
frank
crane
than
that
of
a
literary
artist
comparable
to
tennyson
or
matthew
arnold
perhaps
carlyle
understood
him
but
who
in
america
understood
him
to
this
day
he
is
the
victim
of
gross
misrepresentation
by
enthusiasts
who
read
into
him
all
sorts
of
flatulent
bombast
as
puritanism
is
read
into
the
new
testament
by
methodists
as
for
hawthorne
his
extraordinary
physical
isolation
during
his
lifetime
was
but
the
symbol
of
a
complete
isolation
of
the
spirit
still
surviving
if
his
preference
for
the
internal
conflict
as
opposed
to
the
external
act
were
not
sufficient
to
set
him
off
from
the
main
stream
of
american
speculation
there
would
always
be
his
profound
ethical
skepticism
a
state
of
mind
quite
impossible
to
the
normal
american
at
least
of
blood
hawthorne
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
had
a
single
professed
follower
in
his
own
country
even
his
son
attempting
to
carry
on
his
craft
yielded
neither
to
his
meticulous
method
nor
to
his
detached
point
of
view
in
the
third
generation
with
infinite
irony
there
is
a
who
is
a
reviewer
of
books
for
the
new
york
which
is
almost
as
if
wagner
should
have
a
singing
in
the
operas
of
massenet
of
the
four
indubitable
masters
thus
named
hawthorne
emerson
whitman
and
poe
only
the
last
two
have
been
sufficiently
taken
into
the
consciousness
of
the
country
to
have
any
effect
upon
its
literature
and
even
here
that
influence
has
been
exerted
only
at
and
against
very
definite
adverse
pressure
it
would
certainly
seem
reasonable
for
a
man
of
so
forceful
a
habit
of
mind
as
poe
and
of
such
prodigal
and
arresting
originality
to
have
founded
a
school
but
a
glance
at
the
record
shows
that
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
immediately
he
was
dead
the
shadows
of
the
irving
tradition
closed
around
his
tomb
and
for
nearly
thirty
years
thereafter
all
of
his
chief
ideas
went
disregarded
in
his
own
country
if
as
the
literature
books
argue
poe
was
the
father
of
the
american
short
story
then
it
was
a
posthumous
child
and
had
who
did
their
best
to
conceal
its
true
parentage
when
it
actually
entered
upon
the
vigorous
life
that
we
know
poe
had
been
dead
for
a
generation
its
father
at
the
time
of
its
belated
adolescence
seemed
to
be
bret
harte
and
harte
debt
to
dickens
was
vastly
more
apparent
first
and
last
than
his
debt
to
poe
what
he
got
from
poe
was
essential
it
was
the
inner
structure
of
the
modern
short
story
the
fundamental
devices
whereby
a
mere
glimpse
at
events
could
be
made
to
yield
brilliant
and
seemingly
complete
images
but
he
himself
was
probably
largely
unaware
of
this
indebtedness
a
man
little
given
to
critical
analysis
and
incompetent
for
it
when
his
own
work
was
under
examination
he
saw
its
externals
much
more
clearly
than
he
saw
its
intrinsic
organization
and
these
externals
bore
the
plain
marks
of
dickens
it
remained
for
one
of
his
successors
ambrose
bierce
to
bridge
belatedly
the
space
separating
him
from
poe
and
so
show
the
route
that
he
had
come
and
it
remained
for
foreign
criticism
and
particularly
for
french
criticism
to
lift
poe
himself
to
the
secure
place
that
he
now
holds
it
is
true
enough
that
he
enjoyed
during
his
lifetime
a
certain
popular
reputation
and
that
he
was
praised
by
such
men
as
willis
and
james
russell
lowell
but
that
reputation
was
considerably
less
than
the
fame
of
men
who
were
much
his
inferiors
and
that
praise
especially
in
case
was
much
corrupted
by
reservations
not
many
native
critics
of
respectable
position
during
the
and
would
have
ranked
him
clearly
above
say
irving
or
cooper
or
even
above
longfellow
his
old
enemy
a
few
partisans
argued
for
him
but
in
the
main
as
saintsbury
has
said
he
was
the
victim
of
extreme
and
almost
incomprehensible
injustice
at
the
hands
of
his
countrymen
it
is
surely
not
without
significance
that
it
took
ten
years
to
raise
money
enough
to
put
a
cheap
and
hideous
tombstone
upon
his
neglected
grave
that
it
was
not
actually
set
up
until
he
had
been
dead
years
that
no
contemporary
american
writer
took
any
part
in
furthering
the
project
and
that
the
only
one
who
attended
the
final
ceremony
was
whitman
it
was
baudelaire
french
translation
of
the
prose
tales
and
mallarmé
translation
of
the
poems
that
brought
poe
to
valhalla
the
former
first
printed
in
founded
the
poe
cult
in
france
and
during
the
two
decades
following
it
flourished
amazingly
and
gradually
extended
to
england
and
germany
it
was
one
of
the
in
fact
of
the
whole
decadent
movement
if
baudelaire
the
father
of
that
movement
cultivated
hysteria
with
delight
and
terror
he
was
simply
doing
what
poe
had
done
before
him
both
reacting
against
the
false
concept
of
beauty
as
a
mere
handmaiden
of
logical
ideas
sought
its
springs
in
those
deep
feelings
and
inner
experiences
which
lie
beyond
the
range
of
ideas
and
are
to
be
interpreted
only
as
intuitions
emerson
started
upon
the
same
quest
but
was
turned
off
into
mazes
of
contradiction
and
unintelligibility
by
his
ethical
obsession
the
unescapable
burden
of
his
puritan
heritage
but
poe
never
wandered
from
the
path
you
will
find
in
the
poetic
principle
what
is
perhaps
the
clearest
statement
of
this
new
and
sounder
concept
of
beauty
that
has
ever
been
made
certainly
it
is
clearer
than
any
ever
made
by
a
frenchman
but
it
was
not
until
frenchmen
had
watered
the
seed
out
of
grotesque
and
pots
that
it
began
to
sprout
the
tide
of
poe
ideas
set
in
motion
in
france
early
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
did
not
wash
england
until
the
last
decade
and
in
america
save
for
a
few
dashes
of
spray
it
has
yet
to
show
itself
there
is
no
american
writer
who
displays
the
influence
of
this
most
potent
and
original
of
americans
so
clearly
as
whole
groups
of
frenchmen
display
it
and
whole
groups
of
germans
and
even
a
good
many
englishmen
what
we
have
from
poe
at
first
hand
is
simply
a
body
of
obvious
in
the
manner
with
the
tales
of
ambrose
bierce
as
its
finest
flower
in
brief
an
imitation
of
poe
externals
without
any
comprehension
whatever
of
his
underlying
aims
and
notions
what
we
have
from
him
at
is
a
somewhat
childish
maeterlinckism
a
further
dilution
of
this
maeterlinckism
some
time
ago
got
itself
intermingled
with
the
whitmanic
stream
flowing
back
to
america
through
the
channel
of
french
imagism
with
results
destructive
to
the
sanity
of
earnest
critics
and
fatal
to
the
gravity
of
those
less
austere
it
is
significant
that
the
critical
writing
of
poe
in
which
there
lies
most
that
was
best
in
him
has
not
come
back
no
normal
american
ever
thinks
of
him
as
a
critic
but
only
as
a
poet
as
a
raiser
of
or
as
an
immoral
fellow
the
cause
thereof
is
plain
enough
the
french
instead
of
borrowing
his
critical
theory
directly
deduced
it
afresh
from
his
applications
of
it
it
became
criticism
him
rather
than
him
thus
his
own
speculations
have
lacked
the
authority
of
foreign
approval
and
have
consequently
made
no
impression
the
weight
of
native
opinion
is
naturally
against
them
for
they
are
at
odds
not
only
with
its
fundamental
theories
but
also
with
its
practical
doctrine
that
no
criticism
can
be
profound
and
respectable
which
is
not
also
dull
poe
says
arthur
ransome
in
his
capital
study
of
the
man
and
the
artist
was
like
a
wolf
chained
by
the
leg
among
a
lot
of
domestic
dogs
the
simile
here
is
somewhat
startling
and
ransome
in
a
footnote
tries
to
ameliorate
it
the
domestic
dogs
it
refers
to
were
magnificoes
of
no
less
bulk
than
longfellow
whittier
holmes
and
emerson
in
the
case
of
whitman
the
wolf
was
not
only
chained
but
also
muzzled
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
amazing
than
the
hostility
that
surrounded
him
at
home
until
the
very
end
of
his
long
life
true
enough
it
was
broken
by
certain
feeble
mitigations
emerson
in
praised
him
though
later
very
eager
to
forget
it
and
desert
him
as
clemens
and
howells
years
afterward
deserted
gorky
alcott
thoreau
lowell
and
even
bryant
during
his
brief
bohemian
days
were
polite
to
him
a
group
of
miscellaneous
enthusiasts
gradually
gathered
about
him
and
out
of
this
group
emerged
at
least
one
man
of
some
distinction
john
burroughs
young
adventurers
of
letters
for
example
huneker
went
to
see
him
and
hear
him
half
drawn
by
genuine
admiration
and
half
by
mere
deviltry
but
the
general
tone
of
the
opinion
that
beat
upon
him
the
attitude
of
domestic
criticism
was
unbrokenly
inimical
he
was
opposed
by
misrepresentation
and
neglect
the
prevailing
range
of
criticism
on
my
book
he
wrote
in
a
backward
glance
on
my
own
road
in
has
been
either
mockery
or
denunciation
and
i
have
been
the
marked
object
of
two
or
three
to
me
pretty
serious
official
bufferings
after
thirty
years
of
trial
he
wrote
in
my
book
and
i
three
years
later
public
criticism
on
the
book
and
myself
as
author
of
it
shows
marked
anger
and
contempt
more
than
anything
else
that
is
at
home
abroad
he
was
making
headway
all
the
while
and
long
years
afterward
by
way
of
france
and
england
he
began
to
force
his
way
into
the
consciousness
of
his
countrymen
what
could
have
been
more
ironical
than
the
solemn
celebrations
of
whitman
centenary
that
were
carried
off
in
various
american
universities
in
one
can
picture
the
old
boy
rolling
with
homeric
mirth
in
hell
imagine
the
fate
of
a
university
don
of
or
or
or
even
who
had
ventured
to
commend
leaves
of
grass
to
the
young
gentlemen
of
his
seminary

would
have
come
to
grief
as
swiftly

general

reflected
not

in

but
also
in
the

theory
the
national
attitude
toward

the
national
habit
in

is
the
lack
of

in

position
animated
by

schoolmarms
off
the
sidewalks
of
german
beer
towns
or
of
perfumed
italians
coming
over
to
work
their
abominable
magic
upon
the
daughters
of
and
bathtub
kings
part
of
this
misconception
i
suppose
has
its
roots
in
the
gaudy
imbecilities
of
the
yellow
press
but
there
is
also
a
part
that
belongs
to
the
general
american
tradition
along
with
the
oppression
of
minorities
and
the
belief
in
political
panaceas
its
depth
and
extent
are
constantly
revealed
by
the
naïve
assumption
that
the
fashionable
folk
of
the
large
cities
chiefly
wealthy
industrials
in
the
and
stage
of
culture
constitute
an
aristocracy
and
by
the
scarcely
less
remarkable
assumption
that
the
peerage
of
england
is
identical
with
the
gentry
that
is
that
such
men
as
lord
northcliffe
lord
iveagh
and
even
lord
reading
are
english
gentlemen
and
of
the
ancient
line
of
the
percys
here
as
always
the
worshiper
is
the
father
of
the
gods
and
no
less
when
they
are
evil
than
when
they
are
benign
the
inferior
man
must
find
himself
superiors
that
he
may
marvel
at
his
political
equality
with
them
and
in
the
absence
of
recognizable
superiors
he
creates
superiors
the
sublime
principle
of
one
man
one
vote
must
be
translated
into
terms
of
dollars
diamonds
fashionable
intelligence
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
must
have
clear
and
dramatic
proofs
sometimes
perhaps
the
thing
goes
further
and
is
more
subtle
the
inferior
man
needs
an
aristocracy
to
demonstrate
not
only
his
mere
equality
but
also
his
actual
superiority
the
society
columns
in
the
newspapers
may
have
some
such
origin
they
may
visualize
once
more
the
accomplished
journalist
understanding
of
the
mob
mind
that
he
plays
upon
so
skillfully
as
upon
some
immense
and
cacophonous
organ
always
going
what
the
inferior
man
and
his
wife
see
in
the
sinister
revels
of
those
amazing
first
families
i
suspect
is
often
a
massive
witness
to
their
own
higher
rectitude
to
their
relative
innocence
of
and
the
more
abstruse
branches
of
adultery
in
brief
to
their
firmer
grasp
upon
the
immutable
axioms
of
christian
virtue
the
one
sound
boast
of
the
nether
of
humanity
in
every
land
under
the
cross
but
this
bugaboo
aristocracy
as
i
hint
is
actually
bogus
and
the
evidence
of
its
bogusness
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
insecure
one
gets
into
it
only
onerously
but
out
of
it
very
easily
entrance
is
effected
by
dint
of
a
long
and
bitter
straggle
and
the
chief
incidents
of
that
struggle
are
almost
intolerable
humiliations
the
aspirant
must
school
and
steel
himself
to
sniffs
and
sneers
he
must
see
the
door
slammed
upon
him
a
hundred
times
before
ever
it
is
thrown
open
to
him
to
get
in
at
all
he
must
show
a
talent
for
abasement
and
abasement
makes
him
timorous
worse
that
timorousness
is
not
cured
when
he
succeeds
at
last
on
the
contrary
it
is
made
even
more
tremulous
for
what
he
faces
within
the
gates
is
a
scheme
of
things
made
up
almost
wholly
of
harsh
and
often
unintelligible
taboos
and
the
penalty
for
violating
even
the
least
of
them
is
swift
and
disastrous
he
must
exhibit
exactly
the
right
social
habits
appetites
and
prejudices
public
and
private
he
must
harbor
exactly
the
right
political
enthusiasms
and
indignations
he
must
have
a
hearty
taste
for
exactly
the
right
sports
his
attitude
toward
the
fine
arts
must
be
properly
tolerant
and
yet
not
a
shade
too
eager
he
must
read
and
like
exactly
the
right
books
pamphlets
and
public
journals
he
must
put
up
at
the
right
hotels
when
he
travels
his
wife
must
patronize
the
right
milliners
he
himself
must
stick
to
the
right
haberdashery
he
must
live
in
the
right
neighborhood
he
must
even
embrace
the
right
doctrines
of
religion
it
would
ruin
him
for
all
opera
box
and
society
column
purposes
to
set
up
a
plea
for
justice
to
the
bolsheviki
or
even
for
ordinary
decency
it
would
ruin
him
equally
to
wear
celluloid
collars
or
to
move
to
union
hill
or
to
serve
ham
and
cabbage
at
his
table
and
it
would
ruin
him
too
to
drink
coffee
from
his
saucer
or
to
marry
a
chambermaid
with
a
gold
tooth
or
to
join
the
seventh
day
adventists
within
the
boundaries
of
his
curious
order
he
is
worse
fettered
than
a
monk
in
a
cell
its
obscure
conception
of
propriety
its
nebulous
notion
that
this
or
that
is
honorable
hampers
him
in
every
direction
and
very
narrowly
what
he
resigns
when
he
enters
even
when
he
makes
his
first
deprecating
knock
at
the
door
is
every
right
to
attack
the
ideas
that
happen
to
prevail
within
such
as
they
are
he
must
accept
them
without
question
and
as
they
shift
and
change
in
response
to
great
instinctive
movements
or
perhaps
now
and
then
to
the
punished
but
not
to
be
forgotten
revolts
of
extraordinary
rebels
he
must
shift
and
change
with
them
silently
and
quickly
to
hang
back
to
challenge
and
dispute
to
preach
reforms
and
revolutions
these
are
crimes
against
the
brummagen
holy
ghost
of
the
order
obviously
that
order
can
not
constitute
a
genuine
aristocracy
in
any
rational
sense
a
genuine
aristocracy
is
grounded
upon
very
much
different
principles
its
first
and
most
salient
character
is
its
interior
security
and
the
chief
visible
evidence
of
that
security
is
the
freedom
that
goes
with
it
not
only
freedom
in
act
the
divine
right
of
the
aristocrat
to
do
what
he
jolly
well
pleases
so
long
as
he
does
not
violate
the
primary
guarantees
and
obligations
of
his
class
but
also
and
more
importantly
freedom
in
thought
the
liberty
to
try
and
err
the
right
to
be
his
own
man
it
is
the
instinct
of
a
true
aristocracy
not
to
punish
eccentricity
by
expulsion
but
to
throw
a
mantle
of
protection
about
it
to
safeguard
it
from
the
suspicions
and
resentments
of
the
lower
orders
those
lower
orders
are
inert
timid
inhospitable
to
ideas
hostile
to
changes
faithful
to
a
few
maudlin
superstitions
all
progress
goes
on
on
the
higher
levels
it
is
there
that
salient
personalities
made
secure
by
artificial
immunities
may
oscillate
most
widely
from
the
normal
track
it
is
within
that
entrenched
fold
out
of
reach
of
the
immemorial
certainties
of
the
mob
that
extraordinary
men
of
the
lower
orders
may
find
their
city
of
refuge
and
breathe
a
clear
air
this
indeed
is
at
once
the
and
the
justification
of
an
aristocracy
that
it
is
beyond
responsibility
to
the
general
masses
of
men
and
hence
superior
to
both
their
degraded
longings
and
their
no
less
degraded
aversions
it
is
nothing
if
it
is
not
autonomous
curious
venturesome
courageous
and
everything
if
it
is
it
is
the
custodian
of
the
qualities
that
make
for
change
and
experiment
it
is
the
class
that
organizes
danger
to
the
service
of
the
race
it
pays
for
its
high
prerogatives
by
standing
in
the
forefront
of
the
fray
no
such
aristocracy
it
must
be
plain
is
now
on
view
in
the
united
states
the
makings
of
one
were
visible
in
the
virginia
of
the
later
eighteenth
century
but
with
jefferson
and
washington
the
promise
died
in
new
england
it
seems
to
me
there
was
never
any
aristocracy
either
in
being
or
in
nascency
there
was
only
a
theocracy
that
degenerated
very
quickly
into
a
plutocracy
on
the
one
hand
and
a
caste
of
sterile
on
the
other
the
passion
for
god
splitting
into
a
lust
for
dollars
and
a
weakness
for
mere
words
despite
the
common
notion
to
the
contrary
a
notion
generated
by
confusing
literacy
with
intelligence
new
england
has
never
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
a
genuine
enthusiasm
for
ideas
it
began
its
history
as
a
of
ideas
and
it
is
not
easily
distinguishable
from
a
plant
its
celebrated
adventures
in
mysticism
once
apparently
so
bold
and
significant
are
now
seen
to
have
been
little
more
than
an
elaborate
respectable
unitarians
shocking
the
peasantry
and
scaring
the
horned
cattle
in
the
fields
by
masquerading
in
the
robes
of
rosicrucians
the
ideas
that
it
embraced
in
those
austere
and
days
were
stale
and
when
it
had
finished
with
them
they
were
dead
one
hears
of
jakob
böhme
almost
as
rarely
as
one
hears
of
allen
thurman
so
in
politics
its
glory
is
abolition
an
english
invention
long
under
the
interdict
of
the
native
plutocracy
since
the
civil
war
its
six
states
have
produced
fewer
political
ideas
as
political
ideas
run
in
the
republic
than
any
average
county
in
kansas
or
nebraska
appomattox
seemed
to
be
a
victory
for
new
england
idealism
it
was
actually
a
victory
for
the
new
england
plutocracy
and
that
plutocracy
has
dominated
thought
above
the
housatonic
ever
since
the
sect
of
professional
idealists
has
so
far
dwindled
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
of
any
importance
even
as
an
opposition
when
the
plutocracy
is
challenged
now
it
is
challenged
by
the
proletariat
well
what
is
on
view
in
new
england
is
on
view
in
all
other
parts
of
the
nation
sometimes
with
ameliorations
but
usually
with
the
colors
merely
exaggerated
what
one
beholds
sweeping
the
eye
over
the
land
is
a
culture
that
like
the
national
literature
is
in
three
layers
the
plutocracy
on
top
a
vast
mass
of
undifferentiated
human
blanks
at
the
bottom
and
a
forlorn
gasping
out
a
precarious
life
between
i
need
not
set
out
at
any
length
i
hope
the
intellectual
deficiencies
of
the
plutocracy
its
utter
failure
to
show
anything
even
remotely
resembling
the
makings
of
an
aristocracy
it
is
badly
educated
it
is
stupid
it
is
full
of
superstitions
and
indignations
it
is
without
decent
traditions
or
informing
vision
above
all
it
is
extraordinarily
lacking
in
the
most
elemental
independence
and
courage
out
of
this
class
comes
the
grotesque
fashionable
society
of
our
big
towns
already
described
imagine
a
horde
of
peasants
incredibly
enriched
and
with
almost
infinite
power
thrust
into
their
hands
and
you
will
have
a
fair
picture
of
its
habitual
state
of
mind
it
shows
all
the
stigmata
of
inferiority
moral
certainty
cruelty
suspicion
of
ideas
fear
never
did
it
function
more
revealingly
than
in
the
late
against
the
reds
against
humorless
idealists
who
like
andrew
jackson
took
the
platitudes
of
democracy
quite
seriously
the
machinery
brought
to
bear
upon
these
feeble
and
scattered
fanatics
would
have
almost
sufficed
to
repel
an
invasion
by
the
united
powers
of
europe
they
were
hunted
out
of
their
and
as
if
they
were
so
many
carranzas
or
ludendorffs
dragged
to
jail
to
the
tooting
of
horns
arraigned
before
quaking
judges
on
unintelligible
charges
condemned
to
deportation
without
the
slightest
chance
to
defend
them
selves
torn
from
their
dependent
families
herded
into
and
then
finally
dumped
in
a
snow
waste
to
be
rescued
and
fed
by
the
bolsheviki
and
what
was
the
theory
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
astounding
proceedings
so
far
as
it
can
be
reduced
to
comprehensible
terms
it
was
much
less
a
theory
than
a
fear
a
shivering
idiotic
discreditable
fear
of
a
mere
banshee
an
overpowering
paralyzing
dread
that
some
red
permitted
to
emit
his
balderdash
unwhipped
might
eventually
convert
a
couple
of
courageous
men
and
that
the
courageous
men
filled
with
indignation
against
the
plutocracy
might
take
to
the
highroad
burn
down
a
or
two
and
slit
the
throat
of
some
virtuous
profiteer
in
order
to
lay
this
fear
in
order
to
ease
the
jangled
nerves
of
the
american
successors
to
the
hapsburgs
and
hohenzollerns
all
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
citizen
were
suspended
the
were
burdened
with
laws
that
surpass
anything
heard
of
in
the
austria
of
maria
theresa
the
country
was
handed
over
to
a
frenzied
mob
of
detectives
informers
and
and
the
reds
departed
laughing
loudly
and
were
hailed
by
the
bolsheviki
as
innocents
escaped
from
an
asylum
for
the
criminally
insane
obviously
it
is
out
of
reason
to
look
for
any
hospitality
to
ideas
in
a
class
so
extravagantly
fearful
of
even
the
most
palpably
absurd
of
them
its
philosophy
is
firmly
grounded
upon
the
thesis
that
the
existing
order
must
stand
forever
free
from
attack
and
not
only
from
attack
but
also
from
mere
academic
criticism
and
its
ethics
are
as
firmly
grounded
upon
the
thesis
that
every
attempt
at
any
such
criticism
is
a
proof
of
moral
turpitude
within
its
own
ranks
protected
by
what
may
be
regarded
as
the
privilege
of
the
order
there
is
nothing
to
take
the
place
of
this
criticism
a
few
feeble
platitudes
by
andrew
carnegie
and
a
book
of
moderate
merit
by
john
rockefeller
constitute
almost
the
whole
of
the
interior
literature
of
ideas
in
other
countries
the
plutocracy
has
often
produced
men
of
reflective
and
analytical
habit
eager
to
rationalize
its
instincts
and
to
bring
it
into
some
sort
of
relationship
to
the
main
streams
of
human
thought
the
case
of
david
ricardo
at
once
comes
to
mind
there
have
been
many
others
john
bright
richard
cobden
george
grote
and
in
our
own
time
walther
von
rathenau
but
in
the
united
states
no
such
phenomenon
has
been
visible
there
was
a
day
not
long
ago
when
certain
young
men
of
wealth
gave
signs
of
an
unaccustomed
interest
in
ideas
on
the
political
side
but
the
most
they
managed
to
achieve
was
a
banal
sort
of
socialism
and
even
this
was
abandoned
in
sudden
terror
when
the
war
came
and
socialism
fell
under
suspicion
of
being
genuinely
international
in
brief
of
being
honest
under
the
skin
nor
has
the
plutocracy
of
the
country
ever
fostered
an
inquiring
spirit
among
its
intellectual
valets
and
footmen
which
is
to
say
among
the
gentlemen
who
compose
headlines
and
leading
articles
for
its
newspapers
what
chiefly
distinguishes
the
daily
press
of
the
united
states
from
the
press
of
all
other
countries
pretending
to
culture
is
not
its
lack
of
truthfulness
or
even
its
lack
of
dignity
and
honor
for
these
deficiencies
are
common
to
the
newspapers
everywhere
but
its
incurable
fear
of
ideas
its
constant
effort
to
evade
the
discussion
of
fundamentals
by
translating
all
issues
into
a
few
elemental
fears
its
incessant
reduction
of
all
reflection
to
mere
emotion
it
is
in
the
true
sense
never
it
is
seldom
intelligent
save
in
the
arts
of
the
it
is
never
courageously
honest
held
harshly
to
a
rigid
correctness
of
opinion
by
the
plutocracy
that
controls
it
with
less
and
less
attempt
at
disguise
and
menaced
on
all
sides
by
censorships
that
it
dare
not
flout
it
sinks
rapidly
into
formalism
and
feebleness
its
yellow
section
is
perhaps
its
most
respectable
section
for
there
the
only
vestige
of
the
old
free
journalist
survives
in
the
more
conservative
papers
one
finds
only
a
timid
and
petulant
animosity
to
all
questioning
of
the
existing
order
however
urbane
and
sincere
a
pervasive
and
dread
that
the
mob
now
heated
up
against
the
orthodox
hobgoblins
may
suddenly
begin
to
unearth
hobgoblins
of
its
own
and
so
run
amok
for
it
is
upon
the
emotions
of
the
mob
of
course
that
the
whole
comedy
is
played
theoretically
the
mob
is
the
repository
of
all
political
wisdom
and
virtue
actually
it
is
the
ultimate
source
of
all
political
power
even
the
plutocracy
can
not
make
war
upon
it
openly
or
forget
the
least
of
its
weaknesses
the
business
of
keeping
it
in
order
must
be
done
discreetly
warily
with
delicate
technique
in
the
main
that
business
consists
of
keeping
alive
its
fears
of
strange
faces
of
unfamiliar
ideas
of
unhackneyed
gestures
of
untested
liberties
and
responsibilities
the
one
permanent
emotion
of
the
inferior
man
as
of
all
the
simpler
mammals
is
fear
fear
of
the
unknown
the
complex
the
inexplicable
what
he
wants
beyond
everything
else
is
safety
his
instincts
incline
him
toward
a
society
so
organized
that
it
will
protect
him
at
all
hazards
and
not
only
against
perils
to
his
hide
but
also
against
assaults
upon
his
mind
against
the
need
to
grapple
with
unaccustomed
problems
to
weigh
ideas
to
think
things
out
for
himself
to
scrutinize
the
platitudes
upon
which
his
everyday
thinking
is
based
content
under
kaiserism
so
long
as
it
functions
efficiently
he
turns
when
kaiserism
falls
to
some
other
and
perhaps
worse
form
of
paternalism
bringing
to
its
benign
tyranny
only
the
docile
tribute
of
his
pathetic
allegiance
in
america
it
is
the
newspaper
that
is
his
boss
from
it
he
gets
support
for
his
elemental
illusions
in
it
he
sees
a
visible
embodiment
of
his
own
wisdom
and
consequence
out
of
it
he
draws
fuel
for
his
simple
moral
passion
his
congenital
suspicion
of
heresy
his
dread
of
the
unknown
and
behind
the
newspaper
stands
the
plutocracy
ignorant
unimaginative
and
timorous
thus
at
the
top
and
at
the
bottom
obviously
there
is
no
aristocracy
here
one
finds
only
one
of
the
necessary
elements
and
that
only
in
the
plutocracy
to
wit
a
truculent
egoism
but
where
is
intelligence
where
are
ease
and
surety
of
manner
where
are
enterprise
and
curiosity
where
above
all
is
courage
and
in
particular
moral
courage
the
capacity
for
independent
thinking
for
difficult
problems
for
what
nietzsche
called
the
joys
of
the
labyrinth
as
well
look
for
these
things
in
a
society
of
democracy
obliterating
the
old
aristocracy
has
left
only
a
vacuum
in
its
place
in
a
century
and
a
half
it
has
failed
either
to
lift
up
the
mob
to
intellectual
autonomy
and
dignity
or
to
purge
the
plutocracy
of
its
inherent
stupidity
and
swinishness
it
is
precisely
here
the
first
and
favorite
scene
of
the
great
experiment
that
the
culture
of
the
individual
has
been
reduced
to
the
most
rigid
and
absurd
regimentation
it
is
precisely
here
of
all
civilized
countries
that
eccentricity
in
demeanor
and
opinion
has
come
to
bear
the
heaviest
penalties
the
whole
drift
of
our
law
is
toward
the
absolute
prohibition
of
all
ideas
that
diverge
in
the
slightest
from
the
accepted
platitudes
and
behind
that
drift
of
law
there
is
a
far
more
potent
force
of
growing
custom
and
under
that
custom
there
is
a
national
philosophy
which
erects
conformity
into
the
noblest
of
virtues
and
the
free
functioning
of
personality
into
a
capital
crime
against
society
the
campus
but
there
remain
the
the
free
spirits
in
the
middle
ground
neither
as
anæsthetic
to
ideas
as
the
plutocracy
on
the
one
hand
nor
as
much
the
slaves
of
emotion
as
the
proletariat
on
the
other
have
i
forgotten
them
i
have
not
but
what
actually
reveals
itself
when
this
small
brotherhood
of
the
superior
is
carefully
examined
what
reveals
itself
it
seems
to
me
is
a
gigantic
disappointment
superficially
there
are
all
the
marks
of
a
caste
of
learned
and
sagacious
men
a
great
a
laudable
diligence
a
certain
fine
reserve
and
sniffishness
a
plain
consciousness
of
intellectual
superiority
not
a
few
gestures
that
suggest
the
aristocratic
but
under
the
surface
one
quickly
discovers
that
the
whole
thing
is
little
more
than
and
not
always
very
skillful
learning
is
there
but
not
curiosity
a
heavy
dignity
is
there
but
not
much
genuine
pretentiousness
is
there
but
not
a
trace
of
courage
squeezed
between
the
plutocracy
on
on
side
and
the
mob
on
the
other
the
face
the
eternal
national
problem
of
maintaining
their
position
of
guarding
themselves
against
challenge
and
attack
of
keeping
down
suspicion
they
have
all
the
attributes
of
knowledge
save
the
sense
of
power
they
have
all
the
qualities
of
an
aristocracy
save
the
capital
qualities
that
arise
out
of
a
feeling
of
security
of
complete
independence
of
absolute
immunity
to
onslaught
from
above
and
below
in
brief
the
old
bogusness
hangs
about
them
as
about
the
fashionable
aristocrats
of
the
society
columns
they
are
safe
so
long
as
they
are
good
which
is
to
say
so
long
as
they
neither
aggrieve
the
plutocracy
nor
startle
the
proletariat
immediately
they
fall
into
either
misdemeanor
all
their
apparent
dignity
vanishes
and
with
it
all
of
their
influence
and
they
become
simply
somewhat
ridiculous
rebels
against
a
social
order
that
has
no
genuine
need
of
them
and
is
disposed
to
tolerate
them
only
when
they
are
not
obtrusive
for
various
reasons
this
shadowy
caste
is
largely
made
up
of
men
who
have
official
stamps
upon
their
learning
that
is
of
professors
of
doctors
of
philosophy
outside
of
academic
circles
it
tends
to
shade
off
very
rapidly
into
a
of
isolated
anarchists
one
of
those
reasons
is
plain
enough
the
old
democratic
veneration
for
mere
schooling
inherited
from
the
puritans
of
new
england
is
still
in
being
and
the
mob
always
eager
for
short
cuts
in
thinking
is
disposed
to
accept
a
schoolmaster
without
looking
beyond
his
degree
another
reason
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
higher
education
is
still
rather
a
novelty
in
the
country
and
there
have
yet
to
be
developed
any
devices
for
utilizing
learned
men
in
any
trade
save
teaching
yet
other
reasons
will
suggest
themselves
whatever
the
ramification
of
causes
the
fact
is
plain
that
the
pedagogues
have
almost
a
monopoly
of
what
passes
for
the
higher
thinking
in
the
land
not
only
do
they
reign
unchallenged
in
their
own
chaste
grove
they
also
penetrate
to
all
other
fields
of
ratiocination
to
the
almost
complete
exclusion
of
unshrived
rivals
they
dominate
the
weeklies
of
opinion
they
are
to
the
fore
in
every
review
they
write
of
the
serious
books
of
the
country
they
begin
to
invade
the
newspapers
they
instruct
and
exhort
the
yokelry
from
the
stump
they
have
even
begun
to
penetrate
into
the
government
one
can
not
turn
in
the
united
states
without
encountering
a
professor
there
is
one
on
every
municipal
commission
there
is
one
in
every
bureau
of
the
federal
government
there
is
one
at
the
head
of
every
intellectual
movement
there
is
one
to
explain
every
new
mystery
professors
appraise
all
works
of
art
whether
graphic
tonal
or
literary
professors
supply
the
brain
power
for
agriculture
diplomacy
the
control
of
dependencies
and
the
distribution
of
commodities
a
professor
was
until
lately
sovereign
of
the
country
and
pope
of
the
state
church
so
much
for
their
opportunity
what
now
of
their
achievement
i
answer
as
one
who
has
had
thrown
upon
him
by
the
impenetrable
operations
of
fate
the
rather
thankless
duties
of
a
specialist
in
the
ways
of
pedagogues
a
sort
of
professor
of
professors
the
job
has
got
me
enemies
i
have
been
accused
of
carrying
on
a
defamatory
against
virtuous
and
laborious
men
i
have
even
been
charged
with
doing
it
in
the
interest
of
the
wilhelmstrasse
the
white
slave
trust
and
the
ghost
of
friedrich
wilhelm
nietzsche
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
all
my
instincts
are
on
the
side
of
the
professors
i
esteem
a
man
who
devotes
himself
to
a
subject
with
hard
diligence
i
esteem
even
more
a
man
who
puts
poverty
and
a
shelf
of
books
above
profiteering
and
evenings
of
jazz
i
am
naturally
monkish
moreover
there
are
more
on
my
family
tree
than
even
a
boston
bluestocking
can
boast
there
was
a
whole
century
when
even
the
most
ignorant
of
my
house
was
at
least
utriusque
but
such
predispositions
should
not
be
permitted
to
color
sober
researches
what
i
have
found
after
long
and
arduous
labors
is
a
state
of
things
that
is
surely
not
altogether
flattering
to
the
under
examination
what
i
have
found
in
brief
is
that
pedagogy
turned
to
general
public
uses
is
almost
as
timid
and
flatulent
as
journalism
that
the
professor
menaced
by
the
timid
dogmatism
of
the
plutocracy
above
him
and
the
incurable
suspiciousness
of
the
mob
beneath
him
is
almost
invariably
inclined
to
seek
his
own
security
in
a
mellifluous
inanity
that
far
from
being
a
courageous
spokesman
of
ideas
and
an
apostle
of
their
free
dissemination
in
politics
in
the
fine
arts
in
practical
ethics
he
comes
close
to
being
the
most
prudent
and
skittish
of
all
men
concerned
with
them
in
brief
that
he
yields
to
the
prevailing
correctness
of
thought
in
all
departments
north
east
south
and
west
and
is
in
fact
the
chief
exponent
among
us
of
the
democratic
doctrine
that
heresy
is
not
only
a
mistake
but
also
a
crime
a
philosophy
is
not
put
to
much
of
a
test
in
ordinary
times
for
in
ordinary
times
philosophies
are
permitted
to
lie
like
sleeping
dogs
when
it
shows
its
inward
metal
is
when
the
band
begins
to
play
the
turmoils
of
the
late
lamentable
war
it
seems
to
me
provided
for
such
a
trying
out
of
fundamental
ideas
and
attitudes
upon
a
colossal
scale
the
whole
thinking
of
the
world
was
thrown
into
confusion
all
the
worst
fears
and
prejudices
of
ignorant
and
emotional
men
came
to
the
front
it
was
a
time
beyond
all
others
in
modern
history
when
intellectual
integrity
was
subjected
to
a
cruel
strain
how
did
the
of
these
states
bear
up
under
that
strain
what
was
the
reaction
of
our
learned
men
to
the
challenge
of
organized
hysteria
mob
fear
incitement
to
excess
downright
insanity
how
did
they
conduct
themselves
in
that
universal
whirlwind
they
conducted
themselves
i
fear
in
a
manner
that
must
leave
a
brilliant
question
mark
behind
their
claim
to
independence
and
courage
to
true
knowledge
and
dignity
to
ordinary
in
brief
to
every
quality
that
belongs
to
the
authentic
aristocrat
they
constituted
themselves
not
a
restraining
influence
upon
the
mob
run
wild
but
the
loudest
spokesmen
of
its
worst
imbecilities
they
fed
it
with
bogus
history
bogus
philosophy
bogus
idealism
bogus
heroics
they
manufactured
blather
for
its
entertainment
they
showed
themselves
to
be
as
naïve
as
so
many
liberty
loan
orators
as
emotional
almost
as
the
spy
hunters
and
as
disdainful
of
the
ordinary
intellectual
decencies
as
the
editorial
writers
i
accumulated
in
those
great
days
for
the
instruction
and
horror
of
posterity
a
very
large
collection
of
academic
arguments
expositions
and
pronunciamentos
it
fills
a
trunk
and
got
me
heavily
into
debt
to
three
its
contents
range
from
solemn
hymns
of
hate
in
the
learned
and
even
the
theological
reviews
and
such
official
donkeyisms
as
the
formal
ratification
of
the
sisson
documents
down
to
childish
harangues
to
public
demands
that
the
study
of
the
enemy
language
and
literature
be
prohibited
by
law
violent
denunciations
of
all
enemy
science
as
negligible
and
fraudulent
vitriolic
attacks
upon
enemy
magnificos
and
elaborate
proofs
that
the
american
revolution
was
the
result
of
a
foul
plot
hatched
in
the
wilhelmstrasse
of
the
time
to
the
wanton
injury
of
two
loving
bands
of
brothers
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
the
slightest
the
proceedings
of
creel
amazing
corps
of
hundred
american
historians
went
further
than
anything
i
have
described
and
in
every
college
town
in
every
university
on
the
prairie
even
the
worst
efforts
of
those
historians
were
vastly
exceeded
but
i
am
forgetting
the
like
phenomena
on
the
other
side
of
the
bloody
chasm
i
am
overlooking
the
darker
crimes
of
the
celebrated
german
professors
not
at
all
those
crimes
against
all
reason
and
dignity
had
they
been
committed
in
fact
would
not
be
evidence
in
favor
of
the
americans
in
the
dock
the
principle
of
law
is
too
well
accepted
to
need
argument
but
i
venture
to
deny
them
and
out
of
a
very
special
and
singular
knowledge
for
i
seem
to
be
one
of
the
few
americans
who
has
ever
actually
read
the
proclamations
of
the
german
professors
all
the
most
indignant
critics
of
them
appear
to
have
accepted
accounts
of
their
contents
having
suffered
the
onerous
labor
of
reading
them
i
now
offer
sworn
witness
to
their
relative
mildness
now
and
then
one
encounters
in
them
a
disconcerting
bray
now
and
then
one
weeps
with
sore
heart
now
and
then
one
is
bogged
in
german
made
wholly
unintelligible
by
emotion
but
taking
them
as
they
stand
and
putting
them
fairly
beside
the
corresponding
documents
of
american
vintage
one
is
at
once
struck
by
their
comparative
suavity
and
decorum
their
freedom
from
mere
rhetoric
and
fustian
above
all
by
their
effort
to
appeal
to
reason
such
as
it
is
rather
than
to
emotion
no
german
professor
from
end
to
end
of
the
war
put
his
hand
to
anything
as
transparently
silly
as
the
sisson
documents
no
german
professor
essayed
to
prove
that
the
seven
years
war
was
caused
by
downing
street
no
german
professor
argued
that
the
study
of
english
would
corrupt
the
soul
no
german
professor
denounced
darwin
as
an
ignoramus
and
lister
as
a
scoundrel
nor
was
anything
of
the
sort
done
so
far
as
i
know
by
any
french
professor
nor
even
by
any
reputable
english
professor
all
such
honorable
efforts
on
behalf
of
correct
thought
in
were
monopolized
by
american
professors
and
if
the
fact
is
disputed
then
i
threaten
upon
some
future
day
when
the
stealthy
yearning
to
forget
has
arisen
to
print
my
proofs
in
parallel
columns
the
most
esteemed
extravagances
of
the
german
professors
in
one
column
and
the
corresponding
masterpieces
of
the
american
professors
in
the
other
i
do
not
overlook
of
course
the
men
who
in
the
midst
of
all
the
uproar
kept
their
counsel
and
their
dignity
a
small
minority
hard
beset
and
tested
by
the
fire
nor
do
i
overlook
the
few
sentimental
fanatics
who
in
the
face
of
devastating
evidence
to
the
contrary
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
that
academic
freedom
was
yet
inviolable
and
so
got
themselves
cashiered
and
began
posturing
in
radical
circles
as
martyrs
the
most
absurd
of
men
but
i
think
i
draw
a
fair
picture
of
the
general
i
think
i
depict
with
reasonable
accuracy
the
typical
response
of
the
only
recognizable
of
the
land
to
the
first
great
challenge
to
their
aristocratic
aloofness
the
first
test
in
the
grand
manner
of
their
freedom
alike
from
the
bellicose
imbecility
of
the
plutocracy
and
the
intolerable
fears
and
childish
moral
certainties
of
the
mob
that
test
exposed
them
shamelessly
it
revealed
their
fast
allegiance
to
the
one
thing
that
is
the
antithesis
of
all
free
inquiry
of
all
honest
hospitality
to
ideas
of
all
intellectual
independence
and
integrity
they
proved
that
they
were
correct
and
in
proving
it
they
threw
a
brilliant
light
upon
many
mysteries
of
our
national
culture
intolerable
among
others
upon
the
mystery
of
our
literature
its
faltering
feebleness
its
lack
of
genuine
gusto
its
dearth
of
salient
personalities
its
general
air
of
poverty
and
imitation
what
ails
the
beautiful
letters
of
the
republic
i
repeat
is
what
ails
the
general
culture
of
the
republic
the
lack
of
a
body
of
sophisticated
and
civilized
public
opinion
independent
of
plutocratic
control
and
superior
to
the
infantile
philosophies
of
the
mob
a
body
of
opinion
showing
the
eager
curiosity
the
educated
skepticism
and
the
hospitality
to
ideas
of
a
true
aristocracy
this
lack
is
felt
by
the
american
author
imagining
him
to
have
anything
new
to
say
every
day
of
his
life
he
can
hope
for
no
support
in
ordinary
cases
from
the
mob
it
is
too
suspicious
of
all
ideas
he
can
hope
for
no
support
from
the
spokesmen
of
the
plutocracy
they
are
too
diligently
devoted
to
maintaining
the
intellectual
he
turns
then
to
the
and
what
he
finds
is
correctness
in
his
two
prime
functions
to
represent
the
life
about
him
accurately
and
to
criticize
it
honestly
he
sees
that
correctness
arrayed
against
him
his
representation
is
indecorous
unlovely
too
harsh
to
be
borne
his
criticism
is
in
contumacy
to
the
ideals
upon
which
the
whole
structure
rests
so
he
is
either
attacked
vigorously
as
an
whose
babblings
ought
to
be
put
down
by
law
or
enshrouded
in
a
silence
which
commonly
disposes
of
him
even
more
effectively
soon
or
late
of
course
a
man
of
genuine
force
and
originality
is
bound
to
prevail
against
that
sort
of
stupidity
he
will
unearth
an
adherent
here
and
another
there
in
the
long
run
they
may
become
numerous
enough
to
force
some
recognition
of
him
even
from
the
most
immovable
exponents
of
correctness
but
the
business
is
slow
uncertain
it
puts
a
burden
upon
the
artist
that
ought
not
to
be
put
upon
him
it
strains
beyond
reason
his
diligence
and
passion
a
man
who
devotes
his
life
to
creating
works
of
the
imagination
a
man
who
gives
over
all
his
strength
and
energy
to
struggling
with
problems
that
are
essentially
delicate
and
baffling
and
pregnant
with
doubt
such
a
man
does
not
ask
for
recognition
as
a
mere
reward
for
his
industry
he
asks
for
it
as
a
necessary
to
his
industry
he
needs
it
as
he
needs
decent
subsistence
and
peace
of
mind
it
is
a
grave
damage
to
the
artist
and
a
grave
loss
to
the
literature
when
such
a
man
as
poe
has
to
seek
consolation
among
his
inferiors
and
such
a
man
as
the
mark
twain
of
what
is
man
is
forced
to
conceal
his
most
profound
beliefs
and
such
men
as
dreiser
and
cabell
are
exposed
to
incessant
attacks
by
malignant
stupidity
the
notion
that
artists
flourish
upon
adversity
and
misunderstanding
that
they
are
able
to
function
to
the
utmost
in
an
atmosphere
of
indifference
or
hostility
this
notion
is
nonsense
if
it
were
true
then
one
would
never
hear
of
painters
going
to
france
or
of
musicians
going
to
germany
what
the
artist
actually
needs
is
comprehension
of
his
aims
and
ideals
by
men
he
respects
not
necessarily
approval
of
his
products
but
simply
an
intelligent
sympathy
for
him
in
the
great
agony
of
creation
and
that
sympathy
must
be
more
than
the
mere
of
other
craftsmen
it
must
come
in
large
part
out
of
a
connoisseurship
that
is
beyond
the
bald
trade
interest
it
must
have
its
roots
in
the
intellectual
curiosity
of
an
aristocracy
of
taste
billroth
i
believe
was
more
valuable
to
brahms
than
even
schumann
his
eager
interest
gave
a
solid
dignity
his
championship
offered
the
musician
a
visible
proof
that
his
labors
had
got
for
him
a
secure
place
in
a
civilized
and
stable
society
and
that
he
would
be
judged
by
his
peers
and
safeguarded
against
the
obtuse
hostility
of
his
inferiors
no
such
security
is
thrown
about
an
artist
in
america
it
is
not
that
the
country
lacks
the
standards
that
brownell
pleads
for
it
is
that
its
standards
are
still
those
of
a
primitive
and
timorous
society
the
excesses
of
comstockery
are
profoundly
symbolical
what
they
show
is
the
moral
certainty
of
the
mob
in
operation
against
something
that
is
as
incomprehensible
to
it
as
the
theory
of
least
squares
and
what
they
show
even
more
vividly
is
the
distressing
lack
of
any
automatic
corrective
of
that
outrage
of
any
firm
and
secure
body
of
educated
opinion
eager
to
hear
and
test
all
intelligible
ideas
and
sensitively
jealous
of
the
right
to
discuss
them
freely
when
the
genius
was
attacked
by
the
comstocks
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
seek
assistance
for
dreiser
among
the
i
found
them
almost
unanimously
disinclined
to
lend
a
hand
a
small
number
permitted
themselves
to
be
induced
but
the
majority
held
back
and
not
a
few
as
i
have
said
actually
offered
more
or
less
furtive
aid
to
the
comstocks
i
pressed
the
matter
and
began
to
unearth
reasons
it
was
it
appeared
dangerous
for
a
member
of
the
and
particularly
for
a
member
of
the
academic
to
array
himself
against
the
mob
inflamed
against
the
moral
indignation
of
the
sort
of
folk
who
devour
vice
reports
and
are
converted
by
the
rev
billy
sunday
if
he
came
forward
he
would
have
to
come
forward
alone
there
was
no
organized
support
behind
him
no
instinctive
urge
of
class
no
prompting
of
a
great
tradition
moved
him
to
speak
out
for
artistic
freedom
england
supplied
the
lack
over
there
they
have
a
mob
too
and
something
akin
to
comstockery
and
a
cult
of
hollow
correctness
but
they
also
have
a
caste
that
stands
above
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
out
of
that
caste
came
aid
for
dreiser
england
is
always
supplying
the
lack
england
or
france
or
germany
or
some
other
country
but
chiefly
england
my
market
and
my
reputation
said
prescott
in
rest
principally
with
england
to
poe
a
few
years
later
the
united
states
was
a
literary
colony
of
great
britain
and
there
has
been
little
change
to
this
day
the
english
leisure
class
says
veblen
is
for
purposes
of
reputable
usage
the
upper
leisure
class
of
this
country
despite
all
the
current
highfalutin
about
melting
pots
and
national
destinies
the
united
states
remains
almost
as
much
an
english
colonial
possession
intellectually
and
spiritually
as
it
was
on
july
the
american
social
pusher
keeps
his
eye
on
mayfair
the
american
literatus
dreams
of
recognition
by
the
london
weeklies
the
american
don
is
lifted
to
bliss
by
the
imprimatur
of
oxford
or
cambridge
even
the
american
statesman
knows
how
to
cringe
to
downing
street
most
of
the
essential
policies
of
wilson
between
and
when
the
realistic
english
finding
him
no
longer
useful
incontinently
dismissed
him
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
those
of
a
british
colonial
premier
he
went
into
the
peace
conference
willing
to
yield
everything
to
english
interests
and
he
came
home
with
a
treaty
that
was
so
extravagantly
english
that
it
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
minority
ever
alert
for
the
makings
of
a
bugaboo
to
scare
the
plain
people
what
lies
under
all
this
subservience
is
simple
enough
the
american
for
all
his
braggadocio
is
quite
conscious
of
his
intrinsic
inferiority
to
the
englishman
on
all
cultural
counts
he
may
put
himself
first
as
a
man
of
business
as
an
adventurer
in
practical
affairs
or
as
a
pioneer
in
the
applied
arts
and
sciences
but
in
all
things
removed
from
the
mere
pursuit
of
money
and
physical
ease
he
well
understands
that
he
belongs
at
the
second
table
even
his
recurrent
attacks
of
anglophobia
are
no
more
than
freudian
evidences
of
his
inferiority
complex
he
howls
in
order
to
still
his
inner
sense
of
inequality
as
he
howls
against
imaginary
enemies
in
order
to
convince
himself
that
he
is
brave
and
against
fabulous
despotisms
in
order
to
prove
that
he
is
free
the
englishman
is
never
deceived
by
this
he
knows
that
it
is
always
possible
to
fetch
the
rebel
back
into
camp
by
playing
upon
his
elemental
fears
and
vanities
a
few
dark
threats
a
few
patronizing
speeches
a
few
oxford
degrees
and
the
thing
is
done
more
the
english
scarcely
regard
it
as
hunting
in
the
grand
manner
it
is
a
business
of
subalterns
when
during
the
early
stages
of
the
war
they
had
occasion
to
woo
the
american
what
agents
did
they
choose
did
they
nominate
thomas
hardy
joseph
conrad
george
moore
and
company
nay
they
nominated
conan
doyle
coningsby
dawson
alfred
noyes
ian
hay
chesterton
kipling
zangwill
and
company
in
the
choice
there
was
high
sagacity
and
no
little
oblique
humor
as
there
was
a
bit
later
in
the
appointment
of
lord
reading
and
sir
auckland
geddes
to
washington
the
valuation
they
set
upon
the
of
the
republic
was
exactly
the
valuation
they
were
in
the
habit
of
setting
at
home
upon
mm
of
the
free
church
federation
they
saw
the
eternal
beneath
the
master
gown
and
mortarboard
let
us
look
closely
and
we
shall
see
him
too
the
essence
of
a
and
autonomous
culture
is
an
unshakable
egoism
it
must
not
only
regard
itself
as
the
peer
of
any
other
culture
it
must
regard
itself
as
the
superior
of
any
other
you
will
find
this
indomitable
pride
in
the
culture
of
any
truly
nation
france
germany
or
england
but
you
will
not
find
it
in
the
culture
of
america
here
the
decadent
majority
still
looks
obediently
and
a
bit
wistfully
toward
the
motherland
no
good
american
ever
seriously
questions
an
english
judgment
on
an
æsthetic
question
or
even
on
an
ethical
philosophical
or
political
question
there
is
in
fact
seldom
any
rational
reason
why
he
should
it
is
almost
always
more
mature
more
tolerant
more
intelligent
than
any
judgment
hatched
at
home
behind
it
lies
a
settled
scheme
of
things
a
stable
point
of
view
the
authority
of
a
free
intellectual
aristocracy
the
pride
of
tradition
and
of
power
the
english
are
persuasive
it
is
beyond
their
imagination
that
any
one
should
seriously
challenge
them
in
this
and
oafish
colony
there
is
no
such
sureness
the
american
always
secretly
envies
the
englishman
even
when
he
professes
to
flout
him
the
englishman
never
envies
the
american
the
extraordinary
colonist
moved
to
give
utterance
to
the
ideas
bubbling
within
him
is
thus
vastly
handicapped
for
he
must
submit
them
to
the
test
of
a
culture
that
in
the
last
analysis
is
never
quite
his
own
culture
despite
its
dominance
looking
within
himself
he
finds
that
he
is
different
that
he
diverges
from
the
english
standard
that
he
is
authentically
american
and
to
be
authentically
american
is
to
be
officially
inferior
he
thus
faces
dismay
at
the
very
start
support
is
lacking
when
he
needs
it
most
in
the
motherland
in
any
motherland
in
any
wholly
autonomous
nation
there
is
a
class
of
men
like
himself
devoted
to
translating
the
higher
manifestations
of
the
national
spirit
into
ideas
men
differing
enormously
among
themselves
but
still
united
in
common
cause
against
the
lethargy
and
credulity
of
the
mass
but
in
a
colony
that
class
if
it
exists
at
all
lacks
coherence
and
certainty
its
authority
is
not
only
disputed
by
the
inertia
and
suspiciousness
of
the
lower
orders
but
also
by
the
superior
authority
overseas
it
is
timorous
and
fearful
of
challenge
thus
it
affords
no
protection
to
an
individual
of
assertive
originality
and
he
is
forced
to
go
as
a
suppliant
to
a
quarter
in
which
nothing
is
his
by
right
but
everything
must
go
by
favor
in
brief
to
a
quarter
where
his
very
application
must
needs
be
regarded
as
an
admission
of
his
inferiority
the
burden
of
proof
upon
him
is
thus
made
double
obviously
he
must
be
a
man
of
very
strong
personality
to
surmount
such
obstacles
triumphantly
such
strong
men
of
course
sometimes
appear
in
a
colony
but
they
always
stand
alone
their
worst
opposition
is
at
home
for
a
colonial
of
less
vigorous
soul
the
battle
is
almost
hopeless
either
he
submits
to
subordination
and
so
wears
docilely
the
inferior
badge
of
a
praiseworthy
and
tolerated
colonist
or
he
deserts
the
minority
for
the
far
more
hospitable
and
confident
majority
and
so
becomes
a
mere
examples
readily
suggest
themselves
i
give
you
poe
and
whitman
as
men
strong
enough
to
weather
the
adverse
wind
the
salient
thing
about
each
of
these
men
was
this
that
his
impulse
to
the
force
of
his
obscure
inner
necessity
was
so
powerful
that
it
carried
him
beyond
all
ordinary
ambitions
and
prudences
in
other
words
that
the
ego
functioned
so
heroically
that
it
quite
disregarded
the
temporal
welfare
of
the
individual
neither
poe
nor
whitman
made
the
slightest
concession
to
what
was
the
predominant
english
taste
the
prevailing
english
authority
of
his
time
and
neither
yielded
in
the
slightest
to
the
maudlin
echoes
of
english
notions
that
passed
for
ideas
in
the
united
states
in
neither
will
you
find
any
recognizable
reflection
of
the
things
that
americans
were
saying
and
doing
all
about
them
even
whitman
preaching
democracy
preached
a
democracy
that
not
one
actual
democrat
in
a
hundred
thousand
could
so
much
as
imagine
what
happened
english
authority
at
the
start
dismissed
them
loftily
they
were
at
best
simply
rare
freaks
from
the
colonies
secondly
american
stupidity
falling
into
step
came
near
overlooking
them
altogether
the
accident
that
maintained
them
was
an
accident
of
personality
and
environment
they
happened
to
be
men
accustomed
to
social
isolation
and
of
the
most
meager
wants
and
it
was
thus
difficult
to
deter
them
by
neglect
and
punishment
so
they
stuck
to
their
guns
and
presently
they
were
discovered
as
the
phrase
is
by
men
of
a
culture
wholly
foreign
to
them
and
perhaps
incomprehensible
to
them
and
thereafter
by
slow
stages
they
began
to
win
a
slow
and
reluctant
recognition
in
england
at
first
only
from
rebels
and
iconoclasts
and
finally
even
in
america
that
either
without
french
prompting
would
have
come
to
his
present
estate
i
doubt
very
much
and
in
support
of
that
doubt
i
cite
again
the
fact
that
poe
high
talents
as
a
critic
not
having
interested
the
french
have
never
got
their
deserts
either
in
england
or
at
home
it
is
lesser
men
that
we
chiefly
have
to
deal
with
in
this
world
and
it
is
among
lesser
men
that
the
lack
of
a
confident
intellectual
viewpoint
in
america
makes
itself
most
evident
examples
are
numerous
and
obvious
on
the
one
hand
we
have
fenimore
cooper
first
making
a
cringing
bow
for
english
favor
and
then
on
being
kicked
out
joining
the
mob
against
sense
he
wrote
books
so
bad
that
even
the
americans
of
admired
them
on
the
other
hand
we
nave
henry
james
a
deserter
made
by
despair
one
so
depressed
by
the
tacky
company
at
the
american
first
table
that
he
preferred
to
sit
at
the
second
table
of
the
english
the
impulse
was
and
is
common
it
was
only
the
forthright
act
that
distinguished
him
and
in
the
middle
ground
showing
both
seductions
plainly
there
is
mark
twain
at
one
moment
striving
his
hardest
for
the
english
and
childishly
delighted
by
every
favorable
gesture
at
the
next
returning
to
the
native
mob
as
its
premier
at
banquets
cavorting
in
the
newspapers
shrinking
poltroonishly
from
his
own
ideas
obscenely
eager
to
give
no
offense
a
much
greater
artist
than
either
poe
or
whitman
so
i
devoutly
believe
but
a
good
deal
lower
as
a
man
the
ultimate
passion
was
not
there
the
decent
householder
always
pulled
the
ear
of
the
dreamer
his
fate
has
irony
in
it
in
england
they
patronize
him
he
is
for
an
american
not
so
bad
in
america
appalled
by
his
occasional
ascents
to
honesty
his
stray
impulses
to
be
wholly
himself
the
dunderheads
return
him
to
arm
length
his
old
place
and
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
them
writing
in
the
new
york
argues
piously
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
him
actually
believing
the
commonplace
heresies
he
put
into
what
is
man
i
have
described
the
disease
let
me
say
at
once
that
i
have
no
remedy
to
offer
i
simply
set
down
a
few
ideas
throw
out
a
few
hints
attempt
a
few
modest
inquiries
into
causes
perhaps
my
argument
often
turns
upon
itself
the
field
is
and
paths
are
hard
to
follow
it
may
be
that
insurmountable
natural
obstacles
stand
in
the
way
of
the
development
of
a
distinctively
american
culture
grounded
upon
a
truly
egoistic
nationalism
and
supported
by
a
native
aristocracy
after
all
there
is
no
categorical
imperative
that
ordains
it
in
such
matters
when
the
conditions
are
right
nature
often
arranges
a
division
of
labor
a
nation
shut
in
by
racial
and
linguistic
isolation
a
sweden
a
holland
or
a
france
is
forced
into
autonomy
by
sheer
necessity
if
it
is
to
have
any
intellectual
life
at
all
it
must
develop
its
own
but
that
is
not
our
case
there
is
england
to
hold
up
the
torch
for
us
as
france
holds
it
up
for
belgium
and
spain
for
latin
america
and
germany
for
switzerland
it
is
our
function
as
the
younger
and
less
confident
partner
to
do
the
simpler
rougher
parts
of
the
joint
labor
to
develop
the
virtues
of
the
more
elemental
orders
of
men
industry
piety
docility
endurance
assiduity
and
ingenuity
in
practical
affairs
the
and
of
the
race
it
seems
to
me
that
we
do
all
this
very
well
in
these
things
we
are
better
than
the
english
but
when
it
comes
to
those
larger
and
more
difficult
activities
which
concern
only
the
superior
minority
and
are
in
essence
no
more
than
products
of
its
efforts
to
its
superiority
when
it
comes
to
the
higher
varieties
of
speculation
and
to
the
fine
arts
and
the
game
of
ideas
then
we
fall
into
a
bad
second
place
where
we
stand
intellectually
is
where
the
english
stand
like
them
we
are
marked
by
a
fear
of
ideas
as
disturbing
and
corrupting
our
art
is
imitative
and
timorous
our
political
theory
is
hopelessly
sophomoric
and
superficial
even
english
toryism
and
russian
bolshevism
are
infinitely
more
profound
and
penetrating
and
of
the
two
philosophical
systems
that
we
have
produced
one
is
so
banal
that
it
is
now
imbedded
in
the
new
thought
and
the
other
is
so
shallow
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
either
to
puzzle
or
to
outrage
a
nevertheless
hope
will
not
down
and
now
and
then
it
is
supported
by
something
rather
more
real
than
mere
desire
one
observes
an
of
revolt
small
but
vigorous
and
sometimes
it
exerts
its
force
not
only
against
the
superficial
banality
but
also
against
the
fundamental
flabbiness
the
intrinsic
childishness
of
the
puritan
the
remedy
for
that
childishness
is
skepticism
and
already
skepticism
shows
itself
in
the
iconoclastic
political
realism
of
harold
stearns
waldo
frank
and
company
in
the
groping
questions
of
dreiser
cabell
and
anderson
in
the
operatic
rebellions
of
the
village
true
imagination
i
often
think
is
no
more
than
a
function
of
this
skepticism
it
is
the
dull
man
who
is
always
sure
and
the
sure
man
who
is
always
dull
the
more
a
man
dreams
the
less
he
believes
a
great
literature
is
thus
chiefly
the
product
of
doubting
and
inquiring
minds

revolt
against
the
immovable
certainties

the

between

the
work
is
quite
impossible
it
is
not
a
biography
but
simply
a
huge
storehouse
of
biographical
raw
materials
whoever
can
read
it
can
also
read
the
official
records
of
the
rebellion
all
the
other
standard
lives
of
old
abe
for

those
of
lamon
herndon
and
weil
stoddard
morse
and
miss
tarbell
fail
still
worse
when
they
are
not
grossly
preachy
and
disingenuous
they
are
trivial
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
no
genuinely
scientific
study
of
the
man
has
ever
been
attempted
the
amazing
conflict
of
testimony
about
him
remains
a
conflict
the
most
elemental
facts
are
yet
to
be
established
he
grows
vaguer
and
more
fabulous
as
year
follows
year
one
would
think
that
by
this
time
the
question
of
his
religious
views
to
take
one
example
ought
to
be
settled
but
apparently
it
is
not
for
no
longer
than
a
year
ago
there
came
a
reverend
author
william
barton
with
a
whole
volume
upon
the
subject
and
i
was
as
much
in
the
dark
after
reading
it
as
i
had
been
before
i
opened
it
all
previous
biographers
it
appeared
by
this
author
evidence
had
either
dodged
the
problem
or
lied
the
official
doctrine
in
this
as
in
other
departments
is
obviously
quite
unsound
one
hears
in
the
that
abe
was
an
austere
and
pious
fellow
constantly
taking
the
name
of
god
in
whispers
just
as
one
reads
in
the
school
that
he
was
a
shining
idealist
holding
all
his
vast
powers
by
the
magic
of
an
inner
and
ineffable
virtue
imagine
a
man
getting
on
in
american
politics
interesting
and
enchanting
the
boobery
sawing
off
the
horns
of
other
politicians
elbowing
his
way
through
primaries
and
conventions
by
the
magic
of
virtue
as
well
talk
of
fetching
the
mob
by
hawking
exact
and
arctic
justice
abe
in
fact
must
have
been
a
fellow
highly
skilled
at
the
great
democratic
art
of
i
like
to
think
of
him
as
one
who
defeated
such
politicians
as
stanton
douglas
and
sumner
with
their
own
weapons
deftly
leading
them
into
ambuscades
boldly
pulling
their
noses
magnificently
and
them
in
brief
as
a
politician
of
extraordinary
talents
who
loved
the
game
for
its
own
sake
and
had
the
measure
of
the
crowd
his
official
portraits
both
in
prose
and
in
daguerreotype
show
him
wearing
the
mien
of
a
man
about
to
be
hanged
one
never
sees
him
smiling
nevertheless
one
hears
that
until
he
emerged
from
illinois
they
always
put
the
women
children
and
clergy
to
bed
when
he
got
a
few
gourds
of
corn
aboard
and
it
is
a
matter
of
unescapable
record
that
his
career
in
the
state
legislature
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
a
tammany
nietzsche
but
as
i
say
it
is
hopeless
to
look
for
the
real
man
in
the
biographies
of
him
they
are
all
full
of
distortion
chiefly
pious
and
sentimental
the
defect
runs
through
the
whole
of
american
political
biography
and
even
through
the
whole
of
american
history
nearly
all
our
professional
historians
are
poor
men
holding
college
posts
and
they
are
ten
times
more
cruelly
beset
by
the
ruling
oligarchy
than
ever
the
prussian
professors
were
by
the
hohenzollerns
let
them
diverge
in
the
slightest
from
what
is
the
current
official
doctrine
and
they
are
turned
out
of
their
chairs
with
a
ceremony
suitable
for
the
expulsion
of
a
drunken
valet
during
the
recent
war
a
herd
of
two
thousand
and
five
hundred
such
miserable
slaves
was
organized
by
creel
to
lie
for
their
country
and
they
at
once
fell
upon
the
congenial
task
of
rewriting
american
history
to
make
it
accord
with
the
ideas
of
davison
admiral
sims
nicholas
murray
butler
the
astors
barney
baruch
and
lord
northcliffe
it
was
a
committee
of
this
herd
that
solemnly
pledged
the
honor
of
american
scholarship
to
the
authenticity
of
the
celebrated
sisson
documents
in
the
face
of
such
acute
miliary
imbecility
it
is
not
surprising
to
discover
that
all
of
the
existing
biographies
of
the
late
colonel
roosevelt
and
they
have
been
rolling
off
the
presses
at
a
dizzy
rate
since
his
death
are
feeble
inaccurate
ignorant
and
preposterous
i
have
read
i
suppose
at
least
ten
of
these
tomes
during
the
past
year
or
so
and
in
all
of
them
i
have
found
vastly
more
gush
than
sense
lawrence
abbott
impressions
of
theodore
roosevelt
and
william
roscoe
thayer
theodore
roosevelt
may
well
serve
as
specimens
abbott
book
is
the
composition
not
of
an
unbiased
student
of
the
man
but
of
a
sort
of
groom
of
the
hero
he
is
so
extremely
eager
to
prove
that
roosevelt
was
the
perfect
according
to
the
transient
definitions
of
that
he
manages
to
get
a
flavor
of
dubiousness
into
his
whole
chronicle
i
find
myself
doubting
him
even
when
i
know
that
he
is
honest
and
suspect
that
he
is
right
as
for
thayer
all
he
offers
is
a
hasty
and
hollow
such
a
work
as
might
have
been
well
within
the
talents
of
say
the
late
murat
halstead
or
the
editor
of
the
new
york
this
thayer
has
been
heavily
praised
of
late
as
the
leading
american
biographer
and
one
constantly
hears
that
some
new
university
has
made
him
doctor
or
that
he
has
been
awarded
a
medal
by
this
or
that
learned
society
or
that
the
post
has
brought
him
a
new
ribbon
from
some
literary
potentate
in
foreign
parts
if
in
fact
he
is
actually
the
cock
of
the
walk
in
biography
then
all
i
have
said
against
american
biographers
is
too
mild
and
mellow
what
one
finds
in
his
book
is
simply
the
correctness
of
a
boston
colonial
consider
for
example
his
frequent
discussions
of
the
war
a
necessity
in
any
work
on
roosevelt
in
england
there
is
the
mob
view
of
the
war
and
there
is
the
view
of
civilized
and
intelligent
men
lansdowne
loreburn
austin
harrison
morel
keynes
haldane
hirst
balfour
robert
cecil
in
new
england
it
would
appear
the
two
views
coalesce
with
the
first
outside
there
is
scarcely
a
line
on
the
subject
in
thayer
book
that
might
not
have
been
written
by
horatio
bottomley
obviously
roosevelt
reaction
to
the
war
must
occupy
a
large
part
of
any
adequate
biography
of
him
for
that
reaction
was
probably
more
comprehensively
typical
of
the
man
than
any
other
business
of
his
life
it
displayed
not
only
his
whole
stock
of
political
principles
but
also
his
whole
stock
of
political
tricks
it
plumbed
on
the
one
hand
the
depths
of
his
sagacity
and
on
the
other
hand
the
depths
of
his
insincerity
fundamentally
i
am
convinced
he
was
quite
out
of
sympathy
with
and
even
quite
unable
to
comprehend
the
body
of
doctrine
upon
which
the
allies
and
later
the
united
states
based
their
case
to
him
it
must
have
seemed
insane
when
it
was
not
hypocritical
and
hypocritical
when
it
was
not
insane
his
instincts
were
profoundly
against
a
new
loosing
of
democratic
fustian
upon
the
world
he
believed
in
strongly
centralized
states
founded
upon
power
and
devoted
to
enterprises
far
transcending
mere
internal
government
he
was
an
imperialist
of
the
type
of
cecil
rhodes
treitschke
and
delcassé
but
the
fortunes
of
domestic
politics
jockeyed
him
into
the
position
of
standing
as
the
spokesman
of
an
almost
exactly
contrary
philosophy
the
visible
enemy
before
him
was
wilson
what
he
wanted
as
a
politician
was
something
that
he
could
get
only
by
wresting
it
from
wilson
and
wilson
was
too
cunning
to
yield
it
without
making
a
tremendous
fight
chiefly
by
chicane
whooping
for
peace
while
preparing
for
war
playing
mob
fear
against
mob
fear
concealing
all
his
genuine
motives
and
desires
beneath
clouds
of
chautauqual
rhetoric
leading
a
mad
dance
whose
tune
changed
at
every
swing
here
was
an
opponent
that
more
than
once
puzzled
roosevelt
and
in
the
end
flatly
dismayed
him
here
was
a
with
a
technique
infinitely
more
subtle
and
effective
than
his
own
so
lured
into
an
unequal
combat
the
rough
rider
got
bogged
in
absurdities
so
immense
that
only
the
democratic
anæsthesia
to
absurdity
saved
him
to
make
any
progress
at
all
he
was
forced
into
fighting
against
his
own
side
he
passed
from
the
scene
bawling
piteously
for
a
cause
that
at
bottom
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
him
believing
in
and
in
terms
of
a
philosophy
that
was
as
foreign
to
his
true
faith
as
it
was
to
the
faith
of
wilson
in
the
whole
affair
there
was
a
colossal
irony
both
contestants
were
intrinsically
frauds
the
fraudulence
of
wilson
is
now
admitted
by
all
save
a
few
survivors
of
the
old
corps
of
official
most
of
them
devoid
of
both
honesty
and
intelligence
no
unbiased
man
in
the
presence
of
the
revelations
of
bullitt
keynes
and
a
hundred
other
witnesses
and
of
the
russian
and
shantung
performances
and
of
innumerable
salient
domestic
phenomena
can
now
believe
that
the
was
ever
actually
in
favor
of
any
of
the
brummagem
ideals
he
once
wept
for
to
the
edification
of
a
moral
universe
they
were
at
best
no
more
than
ingenious
de
guerre
and
even
in
the
day
of
their
widest
credit
it
was
the
espionage
act
and
the
to
the
postoffice
rather
than
any
plausibility
in
their
substance
that
got
them
their
credit
in
roosevelt
case
the
imposture
is
less
patent
he
died
before
it
was
fully
unmasked
what
is
more
his
death
put
an
end
to
whatever
investigation
of
it
was
under
way
for
american
sentimentality
holds
that
it
is
indecent
to
inquire
into
the
weaknesses
of
the
dead
at
least
until
all
the
flowers
have
withered
on
their
tombs
when
a
year
ago
i
ventured
in
a
magazine
article
to
call
attention
to
roosevelt
philosophical
kinship
to
the
kaiser
i
received
letters
of
denunciation
from
all
parts
of
the
united
states
and
not
a
few
forthright
demands
that
i
recant
on
penalty
of
lynch
law
prudence
demanded
that
i
heed
these
demands
we
live
in
a
curious
and
often
unsafe
country
haled
before
a
roosevelt
judge
for
speeding
my
automobile
or
spitting
on
the
sidewalk
or
carrying
a
jug
i
might
have
been
railroaded
for
ten
years
under
some
constructive
corollary
of
the
espionage
act
but
there
were
two
things
that
supported
me
in
my
contumacy
to
the
departed
one
was
a
profound
reverence
for
and
fidelity
to
the
truth
sometimes
almost
amounting
to
fanaticism
the
other
was
the
support
of
my
venerable
brother
in
epistemology
the
eminent
iowa
and
patriot
sherman
writing
in
the
where
he
survives
from
more
seemly
days
than
these
sherman
put
the
thing
in
plain
terms
with
the
essentials
in
the
religion
of
the
militarists
of
germany
he
said
roosevelt
was
utterly
in
sympathy
utterly
perhaps
the
adverb
is
a
bit
too
strong
there
was
in
the
man
a
certain
instinctive
antipathy
to
the
concrete
aristocrat
and
in
particular
to
the
aristocrat
private
code
the
product
no
doubt
of
his
essentially
origin
and
training
but
if
he
could
not
go
with
the
junkers
all
the
way
he
could
at
least
go
the
whole
length
of
their
distrust
of
the
third
order
the
undifferentiated
masses
of
men
below
here
i
daresay
he
owed
a
lot
to
nietzsche
he
was
always
reading
german
books
and
among
them
no
doubt
were
also
sprach
zarathustra
and
jenseits
von
gut
und
böse
in
fact
the
echoes
were
constantly
sounding
in
his
own
harangues
years
ago
as
an
intellectual
exercise
while
confined
to
hospital
i
devised
and
printed
a
of
the
rooseveltian
philosophy
in
parallel
columns
in
one
column
extracts
from
the
strenuous
life
in
the
other
extracts
from
nietzsche
the
borrowings
were
numerous
and
unescapable
theodore
had
swallowed
friedrich
as
a
peasant
swallows
peruna
bottle
cork
label
and
testimonials
worse
the
draft
whetted
his
appetite
and
soon
he
was
swallowing
the
kaiser
of
the
and
speeches
another
somewhat
defective
junker
in
his
palmy
days
it
was
often
impossible
to
distinguish
his
bulls
from
those
of
wilhelm
during
the
war
indeed
i
suspect
that
some
of
them
were
boldly
lifted
by
the
british
press
bureau
and
palmed
off
as
felonious
imprudences
out
of
potsdam
wilhelm
was
his
model
in
and
in
sociology
exegetics
administration
law
sport
and
connubial
polity
no
less
both
roared
for
doughty
armies
eternally
prepared
for
the
theory
that
the
way
to
prevent
war
is
to
make
all
conceivable
enemies
think
twice
thrice
ten
times
both
dreamed
of
gigantic
navies
with
battleships
as
long
as
brooklyn
bridge
both
preached
incessantly
the
duty
of
the
citizen
to
the
state
with
the
soft
pedal
upon
the
duty
of
the
state
to
the
citizen
both
praised
the
habitually
gravid
wife
both
delighted
in
the
armed
pursuit
of
the
lower
fauna
both
heavily
patronized
the
fine
arts
both
were
intimates
of
god
and
announced
his
desires
with
authority
both
believed
that
all
men
who
stood
opposed
to
them
were
prompted
by
the
devil
and
would
suffer
for
it
in
hell
if
in
fact
there
was
any
difference
between
them
it
was
all
in
favor
of
wilhelm
for
one
thing
he
made
very
much
fewer
speeches
it
took
some
colossal
event
such
as
the
launching
of
a
dreadnaught
or
the
birthday
of
a
to
get
him
upon
his
legs
the
reichstag
was
not
constantly
deluged
with
his
advice
and
upbraiding
for
another
thing
he
was
a
milder
and
more
modest
man
one
more
accustomed
let
us
say
to
circumstance
and
authority
and
hence
less
intoxicated
by
the
greatness
of
his
state
finally
he
had
been
trained
to
think
not
only
of
his
own
immediate
fortunes
but
also
of
the
remote
interests
of
a
family
that
in
his
most
expansive
days
promised
to
hold
the
throne
for
many
years
and
so
he
cultivated
a
certain
prudence
and
even
a
certain
ingratiating
suavity
he
could
on
occasion
be
extremely
polite
to
an
opponent
but
roosevelt
was
never
polite
to
an
opponent
perhaps
a
gentleman
by
american
standards
he
was
surely
never
a
gentle
man
in
a
political
career
of
nearly
forty
years
he
was
never
even
fair
to
an
opponent
all
of
his
gabble
about
the
square
deal
was
merely
so
much
protective
coloration
easily
explicable
on
elementary
freudian
grounds
no
man
facing
roosevelt
in
the
heat
of
controversy
ever
actually
got
a
square
deal
he
took
extravagant
advantages
he
played
to
the
worst
idiocies
of
the
mob
he
hit
below
the
belt
almost
habitually
one
never
thinks
of
him
as
a
duelist
say
of
the
school
of
disraeli
palmerston
and
to
drop
a
bit
blaine
one
always
thinks
of
him
as
a
glorified
longshoreman
engaged
eternally
in
cleaning
out
and
not
too
proud
to
gouge
when
the
inspiration
came
to
him
or
to
bite
in
the
clinches
or
to
oppose
the
relatively
fragile
brass
knuckles
of
the
code
with
cuspidors
demijohns
and
abbott
and
thayer
in
their
books
make
elaborate
efforts
to
depict
their
hero
as
one
born
with
a
deep
loathing
of
the
whole
prussian
scheme
of
things
and
particularly
of
the
prussian
technique
in
combat
abbott
even
goes
so
far
as
to
hint
that
the
attentions
of
the
kaiser
during
roosevelt
historic
tour
of
europe
on
his
return
from
africa
were
subtly
revolting
to
him
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
sherman
in
the
article
i
have
mentioned
blows
up
that
nonsense
by
quoting
from
a
speech
made
by
the
tourist
in
berlin
a
speech
arguing
for
the
most
extreme
sort
of
militarism
in
a
manner
that
must
have
made
even
some
of
the
junkers
blow
their
noses
dubiously
the
disproof
need
not
be
piled
up
the
america
that
roosevelt
dreamed
of
was
always
a
sort
of
swollen
prussia
truculent
without
and
regimented
within
there
was
always
a
clank
of
the
saber
in
his
discourse
he
could
not
discuss
the
tamest
matter
without
swaggering
in
the
best
dragoon
fashion
abbott
gets
into
yet
deeper
waters
when
he
sets
up
the
doctrine
that
the
invasion
of
belgium
threw
his
darling
into
an
instantaneous
and
tremendous
fit
of
moral
indignation
and
that
the
curious
delay
in
the
public
exhibition
thereof
so
much
discussed
since
was
due
to
his
abbott
fatuous
interference
a
later
regretted
with
much
bitterness
unluckily
the
evidence
he
offers
leaves
me
full
of
doubts
what
the
doctrine
demands
that
one
believe
is
simply
this
that
the
man
who
for
mere
commercial
advantage
and
in
frederick
famous
phrase
to
make
himself
talked
of
in
the
world
tore
up
the
treaty
of
between
the
united
states
and
colombia
new
granada
whereby
the
united
states
forever
guaranteed
the
sovereignty
and
ownership
of
the
colombians
in
the
isthmus
of
panama
that
this
same
man
thirteen
years
later
was
horrified
into
a
fever
when
germany
facing
powerful
foes
on
two
fronts
tore
up
the
treaty
of
guaranteeing
not
the
sovereignty
but
the
bald
neutrality
of
belgium
a
neutrality
already
destroyed
according
to
the
evidence
before
the
germans
by
belgium
own
acts
it
is
hard
without
an
inordinate
strain
upon
the
credulity
to
believe
any
such
thing
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
instantaneous
indignation
of
the
most
impulsive
and
vocal
of
men
was
diligently
concealed
for
at
least
six
weeks
with
reporters
camped
upon
his
doorstep
day
and
night
begging
him
to
say
the
very
thing
that
he
left
so
darkly
unsaid
can
one
imagine
roosevelt
with
raging
within
him
and
bursting
in
his
veins
holding
his
peace
for
a
month
and
a
half
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
abbott
as
he
says
desired
to
avoid
embarrassing
wilson
but
think
of
roosevelt
showing
any
such
delicacy
for
one
i
am
not
equal
to
the
feat
all
that
unprecedented
reticence
in
fact
is
far
more
readily
explicable
on
other
and
less
lofty
grounds
what
really
happened
i
presume
to
guess
my
guess
is
that
roosevelt
like
the
great
majority
of
other
americans
was
instantly
and
automatically
outraged
by
the
invasion
of
belgium
on
the
contrary
he
probably
viewed
it
as
a
regrettable
but
not
unexpected
or
unparalleled
device
of
war
if
anything
as
something
rather
thrillingly
gaudy
and
effective
a
fine
piece
of
virtuosity
pleasing
to
a
military
connoisseur
but
then
came
the
deluge
of
belgian
atrocity
stories
and
the
organized
campaign
to
enlist
american
sympathies
it
succeeded
very
quickly
by
the
middle
of
august
the
british
press
bureau
was
in
full
swing
by
the
beginning
of
september
the
country
was
flooded
with
inflammatory
stuff
six
weeks
after
the
war
opened
it
was
already
hazardous
for
a
german
in
america
to
state
his
country
case
meanwhile
the
wilson
administration
had
declared
for
neutrality
and
was
still
making
a
more
or
less
sincere
effort
to
practice
it
at
least
on
the
surface
here
was
opportunity
and
he
leaped
to
it
with
sure
instinct
on
the
one
side
was
the
adminstration
that
he
detested
and
that
all
his
his
yearning
to
get
back
his
old
leadership
and
to
become
president
again
in
prompted
him
to
deal
a
mortal
blow
and
on
the
other
side
was
a
issue
full
of
emotional
possibilities
stupendously
pumped
up
by
extremely
clever
propaganda
and
so
far
unembraced
by
any
other
of
the
first
magnitude
is
it
any
wonder
that
he
gave
a
whoop
jumped
upon
his
cayuse
and
began
screaming
for
war
in
war
lay
the
greatest
chance
of
his
life
in
war
lay
the
confusion
and
destruction
of
wilson
and
the
melodramatic
renaissance
of
the
rough
rider
the
professional
hero
the
national
barbarossa
in
all
this
of
course
i
strip
the
process
of
its
plumes
and
spangles
and
expose
a
chain
of
causes
and
effects
that
roosevelt
himself
if
he
were
alive
would
denounce
as
grossly
contumelious
to
his
native
purity
of
spirit
and
perhaps
in
all
honesty
it
is
not
necessary
to
raise
any
doubts
as
to
that
honesty
no
one
who
has
given
any
study
to
the
developement
and
propagation
of
political
doctrine
in
the
united
states
can
have
failed
to
notice
how
the
belief
in
issues
among
politicians
tends
to
run
in
exact
ratio
to
the
popularity
of
those
issues
let
the
populace
begin
suddenly
to
swallow
a
new
panacea
or
to
take
fright
at
a
new
bugaboo
and
almost
instantly
of
the
of
politics
begin
to
believe
that
the
panacea
is
a
sure
cure
for
all
the
malaises
of
the
republic
and
the
bugaboo
an
immediate
and
unbearable
menace
to
all
law
order
and
domestic
tranquillity
at
the
bottom
of
this
singular
intellectual
resilience
of
course
there
is
a
good
deal
of
hard
calculation
a
man
must
keep
up
with
the
procession
of
crazes
or
his
day
is
swiftly
done
but
in
it
there
are
also
considerations
a
good
deal
more
subtle
and
maybe
less
discreditable
for
one
thing
a
man
devoted
professionally
to
patriotism
and
the
wisdom
of
the
fathers
is
very
apt
to
come
to
a
resigned
sort
of
acquiescence
in
all
the
doctrinaire
rubbish
that
lies
beneath
the
national
scheme
of
things
to
believe
let
us
say
if
not
that
the
plain
people
are
gifted
with
an
infallible
sagacity
then
at
least
that
they
have
an
inalienable
right
to
see
their
follies
executed
nonsense
as
a
matter
of
daily
routine
the
politician
ends
by
assuming
that
it
is
sense
even
though
he
does
believe
it
for
another
thing
there
is
the
contagion
of
mob
enthusiasm
a
much
underestimated
murrain
we
all
saw
what
it
could
do
during
the
war
college
professors
taking
their
tune
from
the
yellow
journals
the
rev
clergy
performing
in
the
pulpit
like
so
many
liberty
loan
orators
in
houses
hysteria
grown
epidemic
like
the
influenza
no
man
is
so
remote
and
arctic
that
he
is
wholly
safe
from
that
contamination
it
explains
many
extravagant
phenomena
of
a
democratic
society
in
particular
it
explains
why
the
mob
leader
is
so
often
a
victim
to
his
mob
roosevelt
a
perfectly
typical
politician
devoted
to
the
trade
not
primarily
because
he
was
gnawed
by
ideals
but
because
he
frankly
enjoyed
its
encounters
and
its
gaudy
rewards
was
probably
moved
in
both
ways
and
also
by
the
hard
calculation
that
i
have
mentioned
if
by
any
ineptness
of
the
british
and
indignation
over
the
invasion
of
belgium
had
failed
to
materialize
if
worse
still
some
gross
infringement
of
american
rights
by
the
english
had
caused
it
to
be
forgotten
completely
if
finally
wilson
had
been
whooping
for
war
with
the
populace
firmly
against
him
in
such
event
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
moral
horror
of
roosevelt
would
have
stopped
short
at
a
very
low
amperage
and
that
he
would
have
refrained
from
making
it
the
center
of
his
polity
but
with
things
as
they
were
lying
neatly
to
his
hand
he
permitted
it
to
take
on
an
extraordinary
virulence
and
before
long
all
his
old
delight
in
german
militarism
had
been
converted
into
a
lofty
detestation
of
german
militarism
and
its
chief
spokesman
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
became
its
chief
opponent
getting
rid
of
that
old
delight
of
course
was
not
easily
achieved
the
concrete
enthusiasm
could
be
throttled
but
the
habit
of
mind
remained
thus
one
beheld
the
curious
spectacle
of
militarism
belabored
in
terms
of
militarism
of
the
kaiser
arraigned
in
unmistakably
tones
such
violent
swallowings
and
regurgitations
were
no
novelties
to
the
man
his
whole
political
career
was
marked
in
fact
by
performances
of
the
same
sort
the
issues
that
won
him
most
votes
were
issues
that
at
bottom
he
did
believe
in
there
was
always
a
mental
reservation
in
his
rhetoric
he
got
into
politics
not
as
a
tribune
of
the
plain
people
but
as
an
amateur
reformer
of
the
snobbish
type
common
in
the
eighties
by
the
out
of
the
social
register
he
was
a
young
harvard
man
scandalized
by
the
discovery
that
his
town
was
run
by
men
with
such
names
as
michael
and
terence
googan
that
his
social
inferiors
were
his
political
superiors
his
sympathies
were
essentially
he
had
a
high
view
of
his
private
position
as
a
young
fellow
of
wealth
and
education
he
believed
in
strong
centralization
the
concentration
of
power
in
a
few
hands
the
strict
regimentation
of
the
nether
herd
the
abandonment
of
democratic
platitudes
his
heroes
were
such
federalists
as
morris
and
hamilton
he
made
his
first
splash
in
the
world
by
writing
about
them
and
praising
them
worse
his
daily
associations
were
with
the
old
union
league
crowd
of
republicans
men
almost
apoplectically
opposed
to
every
movement
from
below
safe
and
sane
men
highly
conservative
and
suspicious
men
the
profiteers
of
peace
as
they
afterward
became
the
profiteers
of
war
his
early
adventures
in
politics
were
not
very
fortunate
nor
did
they
reveal
any
capacity
for
leadership
the
bosses
of
the
day
took
him
in
rather
humorously
played
him
for
what
they
could
get
out
of
him
and
then
turned
him
loose
in
a
few
years
he
became
disgusted
and
went
west
returning
after
a
bit
he
encountered
catastrophe
as
a
candidate
for
mayor
of
new
york
he
was
drubbed
unmercifully
he
went
back
to
the
west
he
was
up
to
this
time
a
comic
figure
an
victimized
by
politicians
a
made
ridiculous
by
the
he
detested
but
meanwhile
something
was
happening
that
changed
the
whole
color
of
the
political
scene
and
was
destined
eventually
to
give
roosevelt
his
chance
that
something
was
a
shifting
in
what
might
be
called
the
foundations
of
reform
up
to
now
it
had
been
an
essentially
aristocratic
movement
superior
sniffish
and
but
hereafter
it
took
on
a
strongly
democratic
color
and
began
to
adopt
democratic
methods
more
the
change
gave
it
new
life
what
harvard
the
union
league
club
and
the
had
failed
to
accomplish
the
plain
people
now
undertook
to
accomplish
this
invasion
of
the
old
citadel
of
virtue
was
first
observed
in
the
west
and
its
manifestations
out
there
must
have
given
roosevelt
a
good
deal
more
disquiet
than
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
him
finding
anything
to
his
taste
in
the
outlandish
doings
of
the
populists
the
wild
schemes
of
the
dervishes
his
instincts
were
against
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
as
the
movement
spread
toward
the
east
it
took
on
a
certain
urbanity
and
by
the
time
it
reached
the
seaboard
it
had
begun
to
be
quite
civilized
with
this
new
brand
of
reform
roosevelt
now
made
terms
it
was
full
of
principles
that
outraged
all
his
pruderies
but
it
at
least
promised
to
work
his
entire
political
history
thereafter
down
to
the
day
of
his
death
was
a
history
of
compromises
with
the
new
forces
of
a
gradual
yielding
for
strategic
purposes
to
ideas
that
were
intrinsically
at
odds
with
his
congenital
prejudices
when
after
a
generation
of
that
sort
of
compromising
the
progressive
party
was
organized
and
he
seized
the
leadership
of
it
from
the
westerners
who
had
founded
it
he
performed
a
feat
of
wholesale
englutination
that
must
forever
hold
a
high
place
upon
the
roll
of
political
prodigies
that
is
to
say
he
swallowed
at
one
gigantic
gulp
and
out
of
the
same
herculean
jug
the
most
amazing
mixture
of
social
political
and
economic
perunas
ever
got
down
by
one
hero
however
valiant
however
athirst
a
cocktail
made
up
of
all
the
elixirs
hawked
among
the
boobery
in
his
time
from
woman
suffrage
to
the
direct
primary
and
from
the
initiative
and
referendum
to
the
short
ballot
and
from
prohibition
to
public
ownership
and
from
to
the
recall
of
judges
this
homeric
achievement
made
him
the
head
of
the
most
tatterdemalion
party
ever
seen
in
american
politics
a
party
composed
of
such
incompatible
ingredients
and
hung
together
so
loosely
that
it
began
to
disintegrate
the
moment
it
was
born
in
part
it
was
made
up
of
mere
disordered
enthusiasts
believers
in
anything
and
everything
pathetic
victims
of
the
credulity
complex
habitual
followers
of
jitney
messiahs
incurable
hopers
and
snufflers
but
in
part
it
was
also
made
up
of
rice
converts
like
roosevelt
himself
men
eager
for
office
disappointed
by
the
old
parties
and
now
quite
willing
to
accept
any
aid
that
doctrinaires
could
give
them
i
have
no
doubt
that
roosevelt
himself
carried
away
by
the
emotional
storms
of
the
moment
and
especially
by
the
that
marked
the
first
progressive
convention
gradually
convinced
himself
that
at
least
some
of
the
doctrinaires
in
the
midst
of
all
their
imbecility
yet
preached
a
few
ideas
that
were
workable
and
perhaps
even
sound
but
at
bottom
he
was
against
them
and
not
only
in
the
matter
of
their
specific
sure
cures
but
also
in
the
larger
matter
of
their
childish
faith
in
the
wisdom
and
virtue
of
the
plain
people
roosevelt
for
all
his
fluent
mastery
of
democratic
democratic
gestures
and
all
the
rest
of
the
armamentarium
of
the
had
no
such
faith
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
did
believe
in
democracy
he
believed
simply
in
government
his
remedy
for
all
the
great
pangs
and
longings
of
existence
was
not
a
dispersion
of
authority
but
a
hard
concentration
of
authority
he
was
not
in
favor
of
unlimited
experiment
he
was
in
favor
of
a
rigid
control
from
above
a
despotism
of
inspired
prophets
and
policemen
he
was
not
for
democracy
as
his
followers
understood
democracy
and
as
it
actually
is
and
must
be
he
was
for
a
paternalism
of
the
true
bismarckian
pattern
almost
of
the
napoleonic
or
ludendorffian
pattern
a
paternalism
concerning
itself
with
all
things
from
the
regulation
of
and
to
the
regulation
of
spelling
and
marital
rights
his
instincts
were
always
those
of
the
tory
not
those
of
the
romantic
liberal
all
the
fundamental
objects
of
liberalism
free
speech
unhampered
enterprise
the
least
possible
governmental
interference
were
abhorrent
to
him
even
when
for
campaign
purposes
he
came
to
terms
with
the
liberals
his
thoughts
always
ranged
far
afield
when
he
tackled
the
trusts
the
thing
that
he
had
in
his
eye
was
not
the
restoration
of
competition
but
the
subordination
of
all
private
trusts
to
one
great
national
trust
with
himself
at
its
head
and
when
he
attacked
the
courts
it
was
not
because
they
put
their
own
prejudice
before
the
law
but
because
they
refused
to
put
prejudices
before
the
law
in
all
his
career
no
one
ever
heard
him
make
an
argument
for
the
rights
of
the
citizen
his
eloquence
was
always
expended
in
expounding
the
duties
of
the
citizen
i
have
before
me
a
speech
in
which
he
pleaded
for
a
spirit
of
kindly
justice
toward
every
man
and
woman
but
that
seems
to
be
as
far
as
he
ever
got
in
that
direction
and
it
was
the
gratuitous
justice
of
the
absolute
monarch
that
he
apparently
had
in
mind
not
the
autonomous
and
inalienable
justice
of
a
free
society
the
duties
of
the
citizen
as
he
understood
them
related
not
only
to
acts
but
also
to
thoughts
there
was
to
his
mind
a
simple
body
of
primary
doctrine
and
dissent
from
it
was
the
foulest
of
crimes
no
man
could
have
been
more
bitter
against
opponents
or
more
unfair
to
them
or
more
ungenerous
in
this
department
indeed
even
so
gifted
a
specialist
in
dishonorable
controversy
as
wilson
has
seldom
surpassed
him
he
never
stood
up
to
a
frank
and
chivalrous
debate
he
dragged
herrings
across
the
trail
he
made
seductive
faces
at
the
gallery
he
capitalized
his
enormous
talents
as
an
entertainer
his
rank
as
a
national
hero
his
public
influence
and
consequence
the
two
great
in
which
he
was
engaged
were
screaming
burlesques
upon
justice
he
tried
them
in
the
newspapers
before
ever
they
were
called
he
befogged
them
with
irrelevant
issues
his
appearances
in
court
were
not
the
appearances
of
a
witness
standing
on
a
level
with
other
witnesses
but
those
of
a
comedian
sure
of
his
crowd
he
was
in
his
dealings
with
concrete
men
as
in
his
dealings
with
men
in
the
mass
a
charlatan
of
the
very
highest
skill
and
there
was
in
him
it
goes
without
saying
the
persuasive
charm
of
the
charlatan
as
well
as
the
daring
deviousness
the
humanness
of
naïveté
as
well
as
the
humanness
of
chicane
he
knew
how
to
woo
and
not
only
boobs
he
was
for
all
his
ruses
and
ambuscades
a
jolly
fellow
it
seems
to
be
forgotten
that
the
current
american
theory
that
political
heresy
should
be
put
down
by
force
that
a
man
who
disputes
whatever
is
official
has
no
rights
in
law
or
equity
that
he
is
lucky
if
he
fares
no
worse
than
to
lose
his
constitutional
benefits
of
free
speech
free
assemblage
and
the
use
of
the
mails
it
seems
to
be
forgotten
that
this
theory
was
invented
not
by
wilson
but
by
roosevelt
most
liberals
i
suppose
would
credit
it
if
asked
to
wilson
he
has
carried
it
to
extravagant
lengths
he
is
the
father
superior
of
all
the
present
advocates
of
it
he
will
probably
go
down
into
american
history
as
its
greatest
prophet
but
it
was
first
clearly
stated
not
in
any
wilsonian
bull
to
the
of
all
lands
but
in
roosevelt
proceedings
against
the
paterson
anarchists
you
will
find
it
set
forth
at
length
in
an
opinion
prepared
for
him
by
his
charles
bonaparte
another
curious
and
almost
fabulous
character
also
an
absolutist
wearing
the
false
whiskers
of
a
democrat
bonaparte
furnished
the
law
and
roosevelt
furnished
the
blood
and
iron
it
was
an
almost
ideal
combination
bonaparte
had
precisely
the
touch
of
italian
finesse
that
the
rough
rider
always
lacked
roosevelt
believed
in
the
paterson
doctrine
in
brief
that
the
constitution
does
not
throw
its
cloak
around
heretics
to
the
end
of
his
days
in
the
face
of
what
he
conceived
to
be
contumacy
to
revelation
his
fury
took
on
a
sort
of
lyrical
grandeur
there
was
nothing
too
awful
for
the
culprit
in
the
dock
upon
his
head
were
poured
denunciations
as
violent
as
the
wildest
interdicts
of
a
mediæval
pope
the
appearance
of
such
men
of
course
is
inevitable
under
a
democracy
consummate
showmen
they
arrest
the
wonder
of
the
mob
and
so
put
its
suspicions
to
sleep
what
they
actually
believe
is
of
secondary
consequence
the
main
thing
is
what
they
say
even
more
the
way
they
say
it
obviously
their
activity
does
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
democratic
theory
for
they
are
standing
refutations
of
the
primary
doctrine
that
the
common
folk
choose
their
leaders
wisely
they
damage
it
again
in
another
and
more
subtle
way
that
is
to
say
their
ineradicable
contempt
for
the
minds
they
must
heat
up
and
bamboozle
leads
them
into
a
fatalism
that
shows
itself
in
a
cynical
and
opportunistic
politics
a
deliberate
avoidance
of
fundamentals
the
policy
of
a
democracy
thus
becomes
an
eternal
improvisation
changing
with
the
private
ambitions
of
its
leaders
and
the
transient
and
often
unintelligible
emotions
of
its
rank
and
file
roosevelt
incurably
undemocratic
in
his
habits
of
mind
often
found
it
difficult
to
gauge
those
emotional
oscillations
the
fact
explains
his
frequent
loss
of
mob
support
his
periodical
journeys
into
coventry
there
were
times
when
his
magnificent
talents
as
a
public
comedian
brought
the
proletariat
to
an
almost
unanimous
groveling
at
his
feet
but
there
were
also
times
when
he
puzzled
and
dismayed
it
and
so
awakened
its
hostility
when
he
assaulted
wilson
on
the
neutrality
issue
early
in
he
made
a
quite
typical
mistake
that
mistake
consisted
in
assuming
that
public
indignation
over
the
wrongs
of
the
belgians
would
maintain
itself
at
a
high
temperature
that
it
would
develop
rapidly
into
a
demand
for
intervention
roosevelt
made
himself
the
spokesman
of
that
demand
and
then
found
to
his
consternation
that
it
was
waning
that
the
great
masses
of
the
plain
people
prospering
under
the
wilsonian
neutrality
were
inclined
to
preserve
it
at
no
matter
what
cost
to
the
belgians
in
after
the
affair
things
seemed
to
swing
his
way
again
and
he
got
vigorous
support
from
the
british
press
bureau
but
in
a
few
months
he
found
himself
once
more
attempting
to
lead
a
mob
that
was
fast
slipping
away
wilson
a
very
much
shrewder
politician
with
little
of
roosevelt
weakness
for
succumbing
to
his
own
rhetoric
discerned
the
truth
much
more
quickly
and
clearly
in
he
made
his
campaign
for
reëlection
on
a
flatly
peace
issue
and
not
only
got
himself
reëlected
but
also
drove
roosevelt
out
of
the
ring
what
happened
thereafter
deserves
a
great
deal
more
careful
study
than
it
will
ever
get
from
the
timorous
eunuchs
who
posture
as
american
historians
at
the
moment
it
is
the
official
doctrine
in
england
where
the
thing
is
more
freely
discussed
than
at
home
that
wilson
was
forced
into
the
war
by
an
irresistible
movement
from
below
that
the
plain
people
compelled
him
to
abandon
neutrality
and
move
reluctantly
upon
the
germans
nothing
could
be
more
untrue
the
plain
people
at
the
end
of
were
in
favor
of
peace
and
they
believed
that
wilson
was
in
favor
of
peace
how
they
were
gradually
worked
up
to
complaisance
and
then
to
enthusiasm
and
then
to
hysteria
and
then
to
acute
mania
this
is
a
tale
to
be
told
in
more
leisurely
days
and
by
historians
without
boards
of
trustees
on
their
necks
for
the
present
purpose
it
is
sufficient
to
note
that
the
whole
thing
was
achieved
so
quickly
and
so
neatly
that
its
success
left
roosevelt
surprised
and
helpless
his
issue
had
been
stolen
from
directly
under
his
nose
he
was
left
standing
daunted
and
alone
a
boy
upon
a
burning
deck
it
took
him
months
to
collect
his
scattered
wits
and
even
then
his
attack
upon
the
administration
was
feeble
and
ineffective
to
the
plain
people
it
seemed
a
mere
snapping
at
a
successful
rival
which
in
fact
it
was
and
so
they
paid
no
heed
to
it
and
roosevelt
found
himself
isolated
once
more
thus
he
passed
from
the
scene
in
the
shadows
a
broken
politician
and
a
disappointed
man
i
have
a
notion
that
he
died
too
soon
his
best
days
were
probably
not
behind
him
but
ahead
of
him
had
he
lived
ten
years
longer
he
might
have
enjoyed
a
great
rehabilitation
and
exchanged
his
old
false
leadership
of
the
inflammatory
and
fickle
mob
for
a
sound
and
true
leadership
of
the
civilized
minority
for
the
more
one
studies
his
mountebankeries
as
the
more
one
is
convinced
that
there
was
a
shrewd
man
beneath
the
motley
and
that
his
actual
beliefs
were
anything
but
nonsensical
the
truth
of
them
indeed
emerges
more
clearly
day
by
day
the
old
theory
of
a
federation
of
free
and
autonomous
states
has
broken
down
by
its
own
weight
and
we
are
moved
toward
centralization
by
forces
that
have
long
been
powerful
and
are
now
quite
irresistible
so
with
the
old
theory
of
national
isolation
it
too
has
fallen
to
pieces
the
united
states
can
no
longer
hope
to
lead
a
separate
life
in
the
world
undisturbed
by
the
pressure
of
foreign
aspirations
we
came
out
of
the
war
to
find
ourselves
hemmed
in
by
hostilities
that
no
longer
troubled
to
conceal
themselves
and
if
they
are
not
as
close
and
menacing
as
those
that
have
hemmed
in
germany
for
centuries
they
are
none
the
less
plainly
there
and
plainly
growing
roosevelt
by
whatever
route
of
reflection
or
intuition
arrived
at
a
sense
of
these
facts
at
a
time
when
it
was
still
somewhat
scandalous
to
state
them
and
it
was
the
capital
effort
of
his
life
to
reconcile
them
in
some
dark
way
or
other
to
the
prevailing
platitudes
and
so
get
them
heeded
no
one
seriously
maintains
as
all
americans
once
maintained
that
the
states
can
go
on
existing
together
as
independent
commonwealths
each
with
its
own
laws
its
own
legal
theory
and
its
own
view
of
the
common
constitutional
bond
and
no
one
seriously
maintains
as
all
americans
once
maintained
that
the
nation
may
safely
potter
on
without
adequate
means
of
defense
however
unpleasant
it
may
be
to
contemplate
the
fact
is
plain
that
the
american
people
during
the
next
century
will
have
to
fight
to
maintain
their
place
in
the
sun
roosevelt
lived
just
long
enough
to
see
his
notions
in
these
directions
take
on
life
but
not
long
enough
to
see
them
openly
adopted
to
the
extent
of
his
prevision
he
was
a
genuine
leader
of
the
nation
and
perhaps
in
the
years
to
come
when
his
actual
ideas
are
disentangled
from
the
demagogic
fustian
in
which
he
had
to
wrap
them
his
more
honest
pronunciamentoes
will
be
given
canonical
honors
and
he
will
be
ranked
among
the
prophets
he
saw
clearly
more
than
one
other
thing
that
was
by
no
means
obvious
to
his
age
for
example
the
inevitability
of
frequent
wars
under
the
new
of
extreme
nationalism
again
the
urgent
necessity
for
primary
police
ends
of
organizing
the
backward
nations
into
groups
of
vassals
each
under
the
hoof
of
some
power
yet
again
the
probability
of
the
breakdown
of
the
old
system
of
free
competition
once
more
the
high
social
utility
of
the
spartan
virtues
and
the
grave
dangers
of
sloth
and
ease
finally
the
incompatibility
of
free
speech
and
democracy
i
do
not
say
that
he
was
always
quite
honest
even
when
he
was
most
indubitably
right
but
in
so
far
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
honest
and
exist
at
all
politically
he
inclined
toward
the
straightforward
thought
and
the
candid
word
that
is
to
say
his
instinct
prompted
him
to
tell
the
truth
just
as
the
instinct
of
wilson
prompts
him
to
shift
and
dissimulate
what
ailed
him
was
the
fact
that
his
lust
for
glory
when
it
came
to
a
struggle
was
always
vastly
more
powerful
than
his
lust
for
the
eternal
verities
tempted
sufficiently
he
would
sacrifice
anything
and
everything
to
get
applause
thus
the
statesman
was
debauched
by
the
politician
and
the
philosopher
was
elbowed
out
of
sight
by
the
popinjay
where
he
failed
most
miserably
was
in
his
remedies
a
remarkably
penetrating
diagnostician
unprejudiced
and
with
a
touch
of
genuine
scientific
passion
he
always
stooped
to
quackery
when
he
prescribed
a
course
of
treatment
for
all
his
sensational
attacks
upon
the
trusts
he
never
managed
to
devise
a
scheme
to
curb
them
and
even
when
he
sought
to
apply
the
schemes
of
other
men
he
invariably
corrupted
the
business
with
timorousness
and
insincerity
so
with
his
campaign
for
national
preparedness
he
displayed
the
disease
magnificently
but
the
course
of
medication
that
he
proposed
was
vague
and
unconvincing
it
was
not
indeed
without
justification
that
the
plain
people
mistook
his
advocacy
of
an
adequate
army
for
a
mere
secret
yearning
to
prance
upon
a
charger
at
the
head
of
huge
hordes
so
again
with
his
eloquent
plea
for
national
solidarity
and
an
end
of
hyphenism
the
dangers
that
he
pointed
out
were
very
real
and
very
menacing
but
his
plan
for
abating
them
only
made
them
worse
his
objurgations
against
the
germans
surely
accomplished
nothing
the
hyphenate
of
is
still
a
hyphenate
in
his
heart
with
bitter
and
unforgettable
grievances
to
support
him
roosevelt
very
characteristically
swung
too
far
in
denouncing
german
hyphenism
so
extravagantly
he
contrived
to
give
an
enormous
impetus
to
english
hyphenism
a
far
older
and
more
perilous
malady
it
has
already
gone
so
far
that
a
large
and
influential
party
endeavors
almost
openly
to
convert
the
united
states
into
a
mere
vassal
state
of
england
instead
of
national
solidarity
following
the
war
we
have
only
a
revival
of
one
faction
of
hyphenates
tries
to
exterminate
another
faction
roosevelt
error
here
was
one
that
he
was
always
making
carried
away
by
the
ease
with
which
he
could
heat
up
the
mob
he
tried
to
accomplish
instantly
and
by
what
could
only
be
accomplished
by
a
long
and
complex
process
with
more
good
will
on
both
sides
than
ever
so
opinionated
and
melodramatic
a
was
capable
of
but
though
he
thus
made
a
mess
of
the
cure
he
was
undoubtedly
right
about
the
disease
the
talented
sherman
in
the
monograph
that
i
have
praised
argues
that
the
chief
contribution
of
the
dead
gladiator
to
american
life
was
the
example
of
his
gigantic
gusto
his
delight
in
toil
and
struggle
his
superb
aliveness
the
fact
is
plain
what
he
stood
most
clearly
in
opposition
to
was
the
superior
pessimism
of
the
three
adams
brothers
the
notion
that
the
public
problems
of
a
democracy
are
unworthy
the
thought
and
effort
of
a
civilized
and
man
the
sad
error
that
lies
in
wait
for
all
of
us
who
hold
ourselves
above
the
general
against
this
suicidal
aloofness
roosevelt
always
hurled
himself
with
brave
effect
enormously
sensitive
and
resilient
almost
pathological
in
his
appetite
for
activity
he
made
it
plain
to
every
one
that
the
most
stimulating
sort
of
sport
imaginable
was
to
be
obtained
in
fighting
not
for
mere
money
but
for
ideas
there
was
no
aristocratic
reserve
about
him
he
was
not
in
fact
an
aristocrat
at
all
but
a
quite
typical
member
of
the
upper
his
people
were
not
in
new
amsterdam
but
simple
traders
he
was
himself
a
social
pusher
and
eternally
tickled
by
the
thought
that
he
had
had
a
bonaparte
in
his
cabinet
the
marks
of
the
thoroughbred
were
simply
not
there
the
man
was
blatant
crude
overly
confidential
devious
tyrannical
vainglorious
sometimes
quite
childish
one
often
observed
in
him
a
certain
pathetic
wistfulness
a
reaching
out
for
a
grand
manner
that
was
utterly
beyond
him
but
the
sweet
went
with
the
bitter
he
had
all
the
virtues
of
the
fat
and
complacent
burgher
his
disdain
of
affectation
and
prudery
was
magnificent
he
hated
all
pretension
save
his
own
pretension
he
had
a
sound
respect
for
hard
effort
for
loyalty
for
thrift
for
honest
achievement
his
worst
defects
it
seems
to
me
were
the
defects
of
his
race
and
time
aspiring
to
be
the
leader
of
a
nation
of
men
he
had
to
stoop
to
the
common
level
when
he
struck
out
for
realms
above
that
level
he
always
came
to
grief
this
was
the
unsafe
roosevelt
the
roosevelt
who
was
laughed
at
the
roosevelt
retired
suddenly
to
cold
storage
this
was
the
roosevelt
who
in
happier
times
and
a
better
place
might
have
been
well

what
one
can
iii
the
sahara
of
the
bozart
alas
for
the
south
her
books
have
grown
fewer
she
never
was
much
given
to
literature
in
the
lamented
gordon
coogler
author
of
these
elegaic
lines
there
was
the
insight
of
a
true
poet
he
was
the
last
bard
of
dixie
at
least
in
the
legitimate
line
down
there
a
poet
is
now
almost
as
rare
as
an
a
etcher
or
a
metaphysician
it
is
indeed
amazing
to
contemplate
so
vast
a
vacuity
one
thinks
of
the
interstellar
spaces
of
the
colossal
reaches
of
the
now
mythical
ether
nearly
the
whole
of
europe
could
be
lost
in
that
stupendous
region
of
fat
farms
shoddy
cities
and
paralyzed
cerebrums
one
could
throw
in
france
germany
and
italy
and
still
have
room
for
the
british
isles
and
yet
for
all
its
size
and
all
its
wealth
and
all
the
progress
it
babbles
of
it
is
almost
as
sterile
artistically
intellectually
culturally
as
the
sahara
desert
there
are
single
acres
in
europe
that
house
more
men
than
all
the
states
south
of
the
potomac
there
are
probably
single
square
miles
in
america
if
the
whole
of
the
late
confederacy
were
to
be
engulfed
by
a
tidal
wave
the
effect
upon
the
civilized
minority
of
men
in
the
world
would
be
but
little
greater
than
that
of
a
flood
on
the
it
would
be
impossible
in
all
history
to
match
so
complete
a
of
a
civilization
i
say
a
civilization
because
that
is
what
in
the
old
days
the
south
had
despite
the
baptist
and
methodist
barbarism
that
reigns
down
there
now
more
it
was
a
civilization
of
manifold
excellences
perhaps
the
best
that
the
western
hemisphere
has
ever
seen
undoubtedly
the
best
that
these
states
have
ever
seen
down
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
and
even
beyond
the
main
hatchery
of
ideas
on
this
side
of
the
water
was
across
the
potomac
bridges
the
new
england
shopkeepers
and
theologians
never
really
developed
a
civilization
all
they
ever
developed
was
a
government
they
were
at
their
best
tawdry
and
tacky
fellows
oafish
in
manner
and
devoid
of
imagination
one
searches
the
books
in
vain
for
mention
of
a
salient
yankee
gentleman
as
well
look
for
a
welsh
gentleman
but
in
the
south
there
were
men
of
delicate
fancy
urbane
instinct
and
aristocratic
manner
in
brief
superior
men
in
brief
gentry
to
politics
their
chief
diversion
they
brought
active
and
original
minds
it
was
there
that
nearly
all
the
political
theories
we
still
cherish
and
suffer
under
came
to
birth
it
was
there
that
the
crude
dogmatism
of
new
england
was
refined
and
humanized
it
was
there
above
all
that
some
attention
was
given
to
the
art
of
living
that
life
got
beyond
and
above
the
state
of
a
mere
infliction
and
became
an
exhilarating
experience
a
certain
noble
spaciousness
was
in
the
ancient
southern
scheme
of
things
the
had
leisure
he
liked
to
toy
with
ideas
he
was
hospitable
and
tolerant
he
had
the
vague
thing
that
we
call
culture
but
consider
the
condition
of
his
late
empire
the
picture
gives
one
the
creeps
it
is
as
if
the
civil
war
stamped
out
every
last
bearer
of
the
torch
and
left
only
a
mob
of
peasants
on
the
field
one
thinks
of
asia
minor
resigned
to
armenians
greeks
and
wild
swine
of
poland
abandoned
to
the
poles
in
all
that
gargantuan
paradise
of
the
there
is
not
a
single
picture
gallery
worth
going
into
or
a
single
orchestra
capable
of
playing
the
nine
symphonies
of
beethoven
or
a

a
single
theater
devoted
to
decent
plays
or
a

public
monument
built
since
the
war
that
is
worth
looking
at

a
single
workshop
devoted
to
the
making
of
beautiful
things
once
you
have
counted
robert
loveman
an
ohioan
by
birth
and
john
mcclure
an
oklahoman
you
will
not
find
a
single
southern
poet
above
the
rank
of
a

rhymester
once
you

counted
james

survivor

a
ghost

a
bit
wistful

infinitely
charming
but
it
has
lost
all
its
old
leadership
to
fabulous
monsters
from
the
lower
depths

industrial
plutocracy
that
is
ignorant
and
ignominious
the

of

choose

not
because

precisely
because

esteem
it
it

by
long
odds
the
most
civilized
of
the
southern
states
now
as
always
it
has
sent
a
host
of
creditable
sons
northward
the

kept
running
into
our
own

virginians
even
the
worst
of
them
show
the
effects
of
a
great
tradition
they
hold
themselves
above
other
southerners
and
with
sound
pretension
if
one
turns
to
such
a
commonwealth
as
georgia
the
picture
becomes
far
darker
there
the
liberated
lower
orders
of
whites
have
borrowed
the
worst
commercial
bounderism
of
the
yankee
and
superimposed
it
upon
a
culture
that
at
bottom
is
but
little
removed
from
savagery
georgia
is
at
once
the
home
of
the
sweater
and
of
the
most
noisy
and
vapid
sort
of
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
methodist
parson
turned
savonarola
and
of
the
lynching
bee
a
european
going
there
to
live
would
not
only
find
intellectual
stimulation
utterly
lacking
he
would
actually
feel
a
certain
insecurity
as
if
the
scene
were
the
balkans
or
the
china
coast
the
leo
frank
affair
was
no
isolated
phenomenon
it
fitted
into
its
frame
very
snugly
it
was
a
natural
expression
of
georgian
notions
of
truth
and
justice
there
is
a
state
with
more
than
half
the
area
of
italy
and
more
population
than
either
denmark
or
norway
and
yet
in
thirty
years
it
has
not
produced
a
single
idea
once
upon
a
time
a
georgian
printed
a
couple
of
books
that
attracted
notice
but
immediately
it
turned
out
that
he
was
little
more
than
an
amanuensis
for
the
local
blacks
that
his
works
were
really
the
products
not
of
white
georgia
but
of
black
georgia
writing
afterward
a
white
man
he
swiftly
subsided
into
the
fifth
rank
and
he
is
not
only
the
glory
of
the
literature
of
georgia
he
is
almost
literally
the
whole
of
the
literature
of
georgia
nay
of
the
entire
art
of
georgia
virginia
is
the
best
of
the
south
and
georgia
is
perhaps
the
worst
the
one
is
simply
senile
the
other
is
crass
gross
vulgar
and
obnoxious
between
lies
a
vast
plain
of
mediocrity
stupidity
lethargy
almost
of
dead
silence
in
the
north
of
course
there
is
also
grossness
crassness
vulgarity
the
north
in
its
way
is
also
stupid
and
obnoxious
but
nowhere
in
the
north
is
there
such
complete
sterility
so
depressing
a
lack
of
all
civilized
gesture
and
aspiration
one
would
find
it
difficult
to
unearth
a
city
between
the
ohio
and
the
pacific
that
is
struggling
to
establish
an
orchestra
or
setting
up
a
little
theater
or
going
in
for
an
art
gallery
or
making
some
other
effort
to
get
into
touch
with
civilization
these
efforts
often
fail
and
sometimes
they
succeed
rather
absurdly
but
under
them
there
is
at
least
an
impulse
that
deserves
respect
and
that
is
the
impulse
to
seek
beauty
and
to
experiment
with
ideas
and
so
to
give
the
life
of
every
day
a
certain
dignity
and
purpose
you
will
find
no
such
impulse
in
the
south
there
are
no
committees
down
there
cadging
subscriptions
for
orchestras
if
a
string
quartet
is
ever
heard
there
the
news
of
it
has
never
come
out
an
opera
troupe
when
it
roves
the
land
is
a
nine
days
wonder
the
little
theater
movement
has
swept
the
whole
country
enormously
augmenting
the
public
interest
in
sound
plays
giving
new
dramatists
their
chance
forcing
reforms
upon
the
commercial
theater
everywhere
else
the
wave
rolls
high
but
along
the
line
of
the
potomac
it
breaks
upon
a
shore
there
is
no
little
theater
beyond
there
is
no
gallery
of
pictures
no
artist
ever
gives
exhibitions
no
one
talks
of
such
things
no
one
seems
to
be
interested
in
such
things
as
for
the
cause
of
this
unanimous
torpor
and
doltishness
this
curious
and
almost
pathological
estrangement
from
everything
that
makes
for
a
civilized
jculture
i
have
hinted
at
it
already
and
now
state
it
again
the
south
has
simply
been
drained
of
all
its
best
blood
the
vast
of
the
civil
war
half
exterminated
and
wholly
paralyzed
the
old
aristocracy
and
so
left
the
land
to
the
harsh
mercies
of
the
poor
white
trash
now
its
masters
the
war
of
course
was
not
a
complete
massacre
it
spared
a
decent
number
of
southerners
perhaps
even
some
of
the
very
best
moreover
other
countries
notably
france
and
germany
have
survived
far
more
staggering
butcheries
and
even
showed
marked
progress
thereafter
but
the
war
not
only
cost
a
great
many
valuable
lives
it
also
brought
bankruptcy
demoralization
and
despair
in
its
train
and
so
the
majority
of
the
southerners
that
were
left
broken
in
spirit
and
unable
to
live
under
the
new
dispensation
cleared
out
a
few
went
to
south
america
to
egypt
to
the
far
east
most
came
north
they
were
fecund
their
progeny
is
widely
dispersed
to
the
great
benefit
of
the
north
a
southerner
of
good
blood
almost
always
does
well
in
the
north
he
finds
even
in
the
big
cities
surroundings
fit
for
a
man
of
condition
his
peculiar
qualities
have
a
high
social
value
and
are
esteemed
he
is
welcomed
by
the
codfish
aristocracy
as
one
palpably
superior
but
in
the
south
he
throws
up
his
hands
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
stoop
to
the
common
level
he
can
not
brawl
in
politics
with
the
grandsons
of
his
tenants
he
is
unable
to
share
their
fierce
jealousy
of
the
emerging
black
the
cornerstone
of
all
their
public
thinking
he
is
anæsthetic
to
their
theological
and
political
enthusiasms
he
finds
himself
an
alien
at
their
feasts
of
soul
and
so
he
withdraws
into
his
tower
and
is
heard
of
no
more
cabell
is
almost
a
perfect
example
his
eyes
for
years
were
turned
toward
the
past
he
became
a
professor
of
the
grotesque
genealogizing
that
decaying
aristocracies
affect
it
was
only
by
a
sort
of
accident
that
he
discovered
himself
to
be
an
artist
the
south
is
unaware
of
the
fact
to
this
day
it
regards
woodrow
wilson
and
john
temple
graves
as
much
finer
stylists
and
frank
stanton
as
an
infinitely
greater
poet
if
it
has
heard
which
i
doubt
that
cabell
has
been
hoofed
by
the
comstocks
it
unquestionably
views
that
assault
as
a
deserved
rebuke
to
a
fellow
who
indulges
a
lewd
passion
for
fancy
writing
and
is
a
covert
enemy
to
the
only
true
christianity
what
is
needed
down
there
before
the
vexatious
public
problems
of
the
region
may
be
intelligently
approached
is
a
survey
of
the
population
by
competent
ethnologists
and
anthropologists
the
immigrants
of
the
north
have
been
studied
at
great
length
and
any
one
who
is
interested
may
now
apply
to
the
bureau
of
ethnology
for
elaborate
data
as
to
their
racial
strains
their
stature
and
cranial
indices
their
relative
capacity
for
education
and
the
changes
that
they
undergo
under
american
but
the
older
stocks
of
the
south
and
particularly
the
emancipated
and
dominant
poor
white
trash
have
never
been
investigated
scientifically
and
most
of
the
current
generalizations
about
them
are
probably
wrong
for
example
the
generalization
that
they
are
purely
in
blood
this
i
doubt
very
seriously
the
chief
strain
down
there
i
believe
is
celtic
rather
than
saxon
particularly
in
the
hill
country
french
blood
too
shows
itself
here
and
there
and
so
does
spanish
and
so
does
german
the
entered
from
the
northward
by
way
of
the
limestone
belt
just
east
of
the
alleghenies
again
it
is
very
likely
that
in
some
parts
of
the
south
a
good
many
of
the
plebeian
whites
have
more
than
a
trace
of
negro
blood
interbreeding
under
concubinage
produced
some
very
light
at
an
early
day
and
no
doubt
appreciable
numbers
of
them
went
over
into
the
white
race
by
the
simple
process
of
changing
their
abode
not
long
ago
i
read
a
curious
article
by
an
intelligent
negro
in
which
he
stated
that
it
is
easy
for
a
very
light
negro
to
pass
as
white
in
the
south
on
account
of
the
fact
that
large
numbers
of
southerners
accepted
as
white
have
distinctly
negroid
features
thus
it
becomes
a
delicate
and
dangerous
matter
for
a
train
conductor
or
a
to
challenge
a
suspect
but
the
celtic
strain
is
far
more
obvious
than
any
of
these
others
it
not
only
makes
itself
visible
in
physical
stigmata
leanness
and
dark
coloring
but
also
in
mental
traits
for
example
the
religious
thought
of
the
south
is
almost
precisely
identical
with
the
religious
thought
of
wales
there
is
the
same
naïve
belief
in
an
anthropomorphic
creator
but
little
removed
in
manner
and
desire
from
an
evangelical
bishop
there
is
the
same
submission
to
an
ignorant
and
impudent
sacerdotal
tyranny
and
there
is
the
same
sharp
contrast
between
doctrinal
orthodoxy
and
private
ethics
read
caradoc
evans
ironical
picture
of
the
welsh
wesleyans
in
his
preface
to
my
neighbors
and
you
will
be
instantly
reminded
of
the
georgia
and
carolina
methodists
the
most
booming
sort
of
piety
in
the
south
is
not
incompatible
with
the
theory
that
lynching
is
a
benign
institution
two
generations
ago
it
was
not
incompatible
with
an
ardent
belief
in
slavery
it
is
highly
probable
that
some
of
the
worst
blood
of
western
europe
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
southern
poor
whites
now
poor
no
longer
the
original
strains
according
to
every
honest
historian
were
extremely
corrupt
philip
alexander
bruce
a
virginian
of
the
old
gentry
says
in
his
industrial
history
of
virginia
in
the
seventeenth
century
that
the
first
generation
was
largely
illegitimate
one
of
the
most
common
offenses
against
morality
committed
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
in
virginia
during
the
seventeenth
century
he
says
was
bastardy
the
mothers
of
these
bastards
he
continues
were
chiefly
indentured
servants
and
had
belonged
to
the
lowest
class
in
their
native
country
fanny
kemble
butler
writing
of
the
georgia
poor
whites
of
a
century
later
described
them
as
the
most
degraded
race
of
human
beings
claiming
an
origin
that
can
be
found
on
the
face
of
the
earth
filthy
lazy
ignorant
brutal
proud
penniless
savages
the
and
the
chautauqua
of
course
have
appreciably
mellowed
the
descendants
of
these
savages
and
their
economic
progress
and
rise
to
political
power
have
done
perhaps
even
more
but
the
marks
of
their
origin
are
still
unpleasantly
plentiful
every
now
and
then
they
produce
a
political
leader
who
puts
their
secret
notions
of
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
into
plain
words
to
the
amazement
and
scandal
of
the
rest
of
the
country
that
amazement
is
turned
into
downright
incredulity
when
news
comes
that
his
platform
has
got
him
high
office
and
that
he
is
trying
to
execute
it
in
the
great
days
of
the
south
the
line
between
the
gentry
and
the
poor
whites
was
very
sharply
drawn
there
was
absolutely
no
intermarriage
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
not
a
single
instance
in
history
of
a
southerner
of
the
upper
class
marrying
one
of
the
bondwomen
described
by
bruce
in
other
societies
characterized
by
class
distinctions
of
that
sort
it
is
common
for
the
lower
class
to
be
improved
by
crosses
that
is
to
say
the
men
of
the
upper
class
take
women
of
the
lower
class
as
mistresses
and
out
of
such
unions
spring
the
extraordinary
plebeians
who
rise
sharply
from
the
common
level
and
so
propagate
the
delusion
that
all
other
plebeians
would
do
the
same
thing
if
they
had
the
chance
in
brief
the
delusion
that
class
distinctions
are
merely
economic
and
conventional
and
not
congenital
and
genuine
but
in
the
south
the
men
of
the
upper
classes
sought
their
mistresses
among
the
blacks
and
after
a
few
generations
there
was
so
much
white
blood
in
the
black
women
that
they
were
considerably
more
attractive
than
the
unhealthy
and
bedraggled
women
of
the
poor
whites
this
preference
continued
into
our
own
time
a
southerner
of
good
family
once
told
me
in
all
seriousness
that
he
had
reached
his
majority
before
it
ever
occurred
to
him
that
a
white
woman
might
make
quite
as
agreeable
a
mistress
as
the
octaroons
of
his
jejune
fancy
if
the
thing
has
changed
of
late
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
southern
white
man
but
of
the
southern
mulatto
women
the
more
sightly
yellow
girls
of
the
region
with
improving
economic
opportunities
have
gained
and
so
they
are
no
longer
as
willing
to
enter
into
concubinage
as
their
were
as
a
result
of
this
preference
of
the
southern
gentry
for
mulatto
mistresses
there
was
created
a
series
of
mixed
strains
containing
the
best
white
blood
of
the
south
and
perhaps
of
the
whole
country
as
another
result
the
poor
whites
went
unfertilized
from
above
and
so
missed
the
improvement
that
so
constantly
shows
itself
in
the
peasant
stocks
of
other
countries
it
is
a
commonplace
that
nearly
all
negroes
who
rise
above
the
general
are
of
mixed
blood
usually
with
the
white
predominating
i
know
a
great
many
negroes
and
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
think
of
an
exception
what
is
too
often
forgotten
is
that
this
white
bloody
is
not
the
mood
of
the
poor
whites
but
that
of
the
old
gentry
the
mulatto
girls
of
the
early
days
despised
the
poor
whites
as
creatures
distinctly
inferior
to
negroes
and
it
was
thus
almost
unheard
of
for
such
a
girl
to
enter
into
relations
with
a
man
of
that
submerged
class
this
aversion
was
based
upon
a
sound
instinct
the
southern
mulatto
of
is
a
proof
of
it
like
all
other
he
is
an
unhappy
man
with
disquieting
tendencies
toward
habits
of
thought
but
he
is
intrinsically
a
better
animal
than
the
descendant
of
the
old
poor
whites
and
he
not
infrequently
demonstrates
it
it
is
not
by
accident
that
the
negroes
of
the
south
are
making
faster
progress
economically
and
culturally
than
the
masses
of
the
whites
it
is
not
by
accident
that
the
only
visible
æsthetic
activity
in
the
south
is
wholly
in
their
hands
no
southern
composer
has
ever
written
music
so
good
as
that
of
half
a
dozen
composers
who
might
be
named
even
in
politics
the
negro
reveals
a
curious
superiority
despite
the
fact
that
the
race
question
has
been
the
main
political
concern
of
the
southern
whites
for
two
generations
to
the
practical
exclusion
of
everything
else
they
have
contributed
nothing
to
its
discussion
that
has
impressed
the
rest
of
the
world
so
deeply
and
so
favorably
as
three
or
four
books
by
southern
negroes
entering
upon
such
themes
of
course
one
must
resign
one
self
to
a
vast
misunderstanding
and
abuse
the
south
has
not
only
lost
its
old
capacity
for
producing
ideas
it
has
also
taken
on
the
worst
intolerance
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
its
prevailing
mental
attitude
for
several
decades
past
has
been
that
of
its
own
hedge
ecclesiastics
all
who
dissent
from
its
orthodox
doctrines
are
scoundrels
all
who
presume
to
discuss
its
ways
realistically
are
damned
i
have
had
in
my
day
several
experiences
in
point
once
after
i
had
published
an
article
on
some
phase
of
the
eternal
race
question
a
leading
southern
newspaper
replied
by
printing
a
column
of
denunciation
of
my
father
then
dead
nearly
twenty
years
a
philippic
placarding
him
as
an
ignorant
foreigner
of
dubious
origin
inhabiting
the
baltimore
ghetto
and
speaking
a
dialect
recalling
that
of
weber
fields
two
thousand
words
of
incandescent
nonsense
utterly
false
and
beside
the
point
but
exactly
meeting
the
southern
notion
of
effective
controversy
another
time
i
published
a
short
discourse
on
lynching
arguing
that
the
sport
was
popular
in
the
south
because
the
backward
culture
of
the
region
denied
the
populace
more
seemly
recreations
among
such
recreations
i
mentioned
those
afforded
by
brass
bands
symphony
orchestras
boxing
matches
amateur
athletic
contests
roof
gardens
horse
races
and
so
on
in
reply
another
great
southern
journal
denounced
me
as
a
man
of
wineshop
temperament
tastes
and
pornographic
predilections
in
other
words
brass
bands
in
the
south
are
classed
with
brass
jewelry
and
both
are
snares
of
the
devil
to
advocate
setting
up
symphony
orchestras
is
pornography
alas
when
the
touchy
southerner
attempts
a
greater
urbanity
the
result
is
often
even
worse
some
time
ago
a
colleague
of
mine
printed
an
article
deploring
the
arrested
cultural
development
of
georgia
in
reply
he
received
a
number
of
protests
from
patriotic
georgians
and
all
of
them
solemnly
listed
the
glories
of
the
state
i
indulge
in
a
few
specimens
who
has
not
heard
of
asa
candler
whose
name
is
synonymous
with
a
georgia
product
the
first
in
the
world
was
opened
in
savannah
who
does
not
recall
with
pleasure
the
writings
of
frank
stanton
georgia
brilliant

the

organize

so
on
and
so
on
these
proud
boasts
came
remember
not
from
obscure
private
persons
but
from
leading
georgians
in
one
case
the
state
historian
curious
sidelights
upon
the
mind
another
comes
from
a
stray
copy
of
a
negro
paper
it
describes
an
ordinance
lately
passed
by
the
city
council
of
douglas
forbidding
any
trousers
presser
on
penalty
of
forfeiting
a
bond
to
engage
in
pressing
for
both
white
and
colored
this
in
a
town
says
the
negro
paper
where
practically
all
of
the
white
inhabitants
have
their
food
prepared
by
colored
hands
their
babies
cared
for
by
colored
hands
and
the
clothes
which
they
wear
right
next
to
their
skins
washed
in
houses
where
negroes
live
houses
in
which
the
said
clothes
remain
for
as
long
as
a
week
at
a
time
but
if
you
marvel
at
the
absurdity
keep
it
dark
a
casual
word
and
the
united
press
of
the
south
will
be
upon
your
trail
denouncing
you
bitterly
as
a
scoundrelly
yankee
a
bolshevik
jew
an
agent
of
the
wilhelmstrasse
obviously
it
is
impossible
for
intelligence
to
flourish
in
such
an
atmosphere
free
inquiry
is
blocked
by
the
idiotic
certainties
of
ignorant
men
the
arts
save
in
the
lower
reaches
of
the
gospel
hymn
the
phonograph
and
the
chautauqua
harangue
are
all
held
in
suspicion
the
tone
of
public
opinion
is
set
by
an
upstart
class
but
lately
emerged
from
industrial
slavery
into
commercial
enterprise
the
class
of
hustling
business
men
of
live
wires
of
commercial
club
luminaries
of
drive
managers
of
and
in
brief
of
southerners
inoculated
with
all
the
worst
traits
of
the
yankee
sharper
one
observes
the
curious
effects
of
an
old
tradition
of
truculence
upon
a
population
now
merely
pushful
and
impudent
of
an
old
tradition
of
chivalry
upon
a
population
now
quite
without
imagination
the
old
repose
is
gone
the
old
romanticism
is
gone
the
philistinism
of
the
new
type
of
southerner
is
not
only
indifferent
to
the
ideals
of
the
old
south
it
is
positively
antagonistic
to
them
that
philistinism
regards
human
life
not
as
an
agreeable
adventure
but
as
a
mere
trial
of
rectitude
and
efficiency
it
is
overwhelmingly
utilitarian
and
moral
it
is
inconceivably
hollow
and
obnoxious
what
remains
of
the
ancient
tradition
is
simply
a
certain
charming
civility
in
private
intercourse
often
broken
down
alas
by
the
hot
rages
of
puritanism
but
still
generally
visible
the
southerner
at
his
worst
is
never
quite
the
surly
cad
that
the
yankee
is
his
sensitiveness
may
betray
him
into
occasional
bad
manners
but
in
the
main
he
is
a
pleasant
fellow
hospitable
polite
even
jovial
but
a
bit
absurd
a
bit
pathetic
iv
the
divine
afflatus
the
suave
and
oe
dematous
chesterton
in
a
late
effort
to
earn
the
honorarium
of
a
chicago
newspaper
composed
a
thousand
words
of
labored
counterblast
to
what
is
called
inspiration
in
the
arts
the
thing
itself
he
argued
has
little
if
any
actual
existence
we
hear
so
much
about
it
because
its
alleged
coyness
and
fortuitousness
offer
a
convenient
apology
for
work
the
man
taken
in
such
work
excuses
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
helpless
slave
of
some
power
that
stands
outside
him
and
is
quite
beyond
his
control
on
days
when
it
favors
him
he
teems
with
ideas
and
creates
masterpieces
but
on
days
when
it
neglects
him
he
is
crippled
and
impotent
a
fiddle
without
a
bow
an
engine
without
steam
a
tire
without
air
all
this
according
to
chesterton
is
nonsense
a
man
who
can
really
write
at
all
or
paint
at
all
or
compose
at
all
should
be
able
to
do
it
at
almost
any
time
provided
only
he
is
not
drunk
or
asleep
so
far
chesterton
the
formula
of
the
argument
is
simple
and
familiars
to
dispose
of
a
problem
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
deny
that
it
exists
but
there
are
plenty
of
men
i
believe
who
find
themselves
unable
to
resolve
the
difficulty
in
any
such
cavalier
manner
men
whose
chief
burden
and
distinction
in
fact
is
that
they
do
not
employ
formulæ
in
their
thinking
but
are
thrown
constantly
upon
industry
ingenuity
and
the
favor
of
god
among
such
men
there
remains
a
good
deal
more
belief
in
what
is
vaguely
called
inspiration
they
know
by
hard
experience
that
there
are
days
when
their
ideas
flow
freely
and
clearly
and
days
when
they
are
dammed
up
damnably
say
a
man
of
that
sort
has
a
good
day
for
some
reason
quite
incomprehensible
to
him
all
his
mental
processes
take
on
an
amazing
ease
and
slickness
almost
without
conscious
effort
he
solves
technical
problems
that
have
badgered
him
for
weeks
he
is
full
of
novel
expedients
extraordinary
efficiencies
strange
cunnings
he
has
a
feeling
that
he
has
suddenly
and
unaccountably
broken
through
a
wall
dispersed
a
fog
got
himself
out
of
the
dark
so
he
does
a
double
or
triple
stint
of
the
best
work
that
he
is
capable
of
maybe
of
far
better
work
than
he
has
ever
been
capable
of
before
and
goes
to
bed
impatient
for
the
morrow
and
on
the
morrow
he
discovers
to
his
consternation
that
he
has
become
almost
idiotic
and
quite
incapable
of
any
work
at
all
i
challenge
any
man
who
trades
in
ideas
to
deny
that
he
has
this
experience
the
truth
is
that
he
has
it
constantly
it
overtakes
poets
and
contrapuntists
critics
and
dramatists
philosophers
and
journalists
it
may
even
be
shared
so
far
as
i
know
by
advertisement
writers
chautauqua
orators
and
the
rev
clergy
the
characters
that
all
anatomists
of
melancholy
mark
in
it
are
the
irregular
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
and
the
impossibility
of
getting
them
under
any
sort
of
rational
control
the
brain
as
it
were
stands
to
one
side
and
watches
itself
pitching
and
tossing
full
of
agony
but
essentially
helpless
here
the
man
of
creative
imagination
pays
a
ghastly
price
for
all
his
superiorities
and
immunities
nature
takes
revenge
upon
him
for
dreaming
of
improvements
in
the
scheme
of
things
sitting
there
in
his
lonely
room
gnawing
the
handle
of
his
pen
racked
by
his
infernal
quest
horribly
bedevilled
by
incessant
flashes
of
itching
toothache
and
evil
conscience
thus
tortured
he
makes
atonement
for
his
crime
of
being
intelligent
the
normal
man
the
healthy
and
honest
man
the
good
citizen
and
householder
this
man
i
daresay
knows
nothing
of
all
that
travail
it
is
reserved
especially
for
artists
and
metaphysicians
it
is
the
particular
penalty
of
those
who
pursue
strange
butterflies
into
dark
forests
and
go
fishing
in
enchanted
and
forbidden
streams
let
us
then
assume
that
the
fact
is
proved
the
nearest
poet
is
a
witness
to
it
but
what
of
the
underlying
mystery
how
are
we
to
account
for
that
puckish
and
inexplicable
rise
and
fall
of
inspiration
my
questions
of
course
are
purely
rhetorical
explanations
exist
they
have
existed
for
all
time
there
is
always
a
solution
to
every
human
problem
neat
plausible
and
wrong
the
ancients
in
the
case
at
bar
laid
the
blame
upon
the
gods
sometimes
they
were
remote
and
surly
and
sometimes
they
were
kind
in
the
middle
ages
lesser
powers
took
a
hand
in
the
matter
and
so
one
reads
of
works
of
art
inspired
by
our
lady
by
the
blessed
saints
by
the
souls
of
the
departed
and
even
by
the
devil
in
our
own
day
there
are
explanations
less
but
no
less
fanciful
to
wit
the
explanation
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
pure
chance
and
not
to
be
resolved
into
any
orderly
process
to
wit
the
explanation
that
the
controlling
factor
is
external
circumstance
that
the
artist
happily
married
to
a
dutiful
wife
is
thereby
inspired
finally
to
make
an
end
the
explanation
that
it
is
all
a
question
of
freudian
complexes
themselves
lurking
in
impenetrable
shadows
but
all
of
these
explanations
fail
to
satisfy
the
mind
that
is
not
to
be
put
off
with
mere
words
some
of
them
are
palpably
absurd
others
beg
the
question
the
problem
of
the
how
remains
even
when
the
problem
of
the
why
is
disposed
of
what
is
the
precise
machinery
whereby
the
cerebrum
is
bestirred
to
such
abnormal
activity
on
one
day
that
it
sparkles
and
splutters
like
an
arclight
and
reduced
to
such
feebleness
on
another
day
that
it
smokes
and
gutters
like
a
tallow
dip
in
this
emergency
having
regard
for
the
and
unrelieved
sufferings
of
artists
great
and
small
i
offer
a
new
simple
and
at
all
events
not
ghostly
solution
it
is
supported
by
the
observed
facts
by
logical
analogies
and
by
the
soundest
known
principles
of
psychology
and
so
i
present
it
without
apologies
it
may
be
couched
for
convenience
in
the
following
brief
terms
that
inspiration
is
a
function
of
metabolism
and
that
it
is
chiefly
conditioned
by
the
state
of
the
intestinal
flora
in
larger
words
that
a
man
flow
of
ideas
is
controlled
and
determined
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
not
by
the
whims
of
the
gods
nor
by
the
terms
of
his
armistice
with
his
wife
nor
by
the
combinations
of
some
transcendental
set
of
dice
but
by
the
chemical
content
of
the
blood
that
lifts
itself
from
his
liver
to
his
brain
and
that
this
chemical
content
is
established
in
his
digestive
tract
particularly
south
of
the
pylorus
a
man
may
write
great
poetry
when
he
is
drunk
when
he
is
cold
and
miserable
when
he
is
bankrupt
when
he
has
a
black
eye
when
his
wife
glowers
at
him
across
the
table
when
his
children
lie
dying
of
smallpox
he
may
even
write
it
during
an
earthquake
or
while
crossing
the
english
channel
or
in
the
midst
of
a
methodist
revival
or
in
new
york
but
i
am
so
far
gone
in
materialism
that
i
am
disposed
to
deny
flatly
and
finally
and
herewith
do
deny
flatly
and
finally
that
there
has
lived
a
poet
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
ancient
or
modern
near
or
far
who
ever
managed
to
write
great
poetry
or
even
passably
fair
and
decent
poetry
at
a
time
when
he
was
suffering
from
stenosis
at
any
point
along
the
running
from
the
pylorus
to
the
sigmoid
flexure
in
other
words
when
he
was
but
perhaps
i
had
better
leave
your
medical
adviser
to
explain
after
all
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
any
further
in
this
direction
the
whole
thing
may
be
argued
in
terms
of
the
blood
stream
and
the
blood
stream
is
respectable
as
the
duodenum
is
an
outcast
it
is
the
blood
and
the
blood
only
in
fact
that
the
cerebrum
is
aware
of
of
what
goes
on
elsewhere
it
can
learn
only
by
hearsay
if
all
is
well
below
then
the
blood
that
enters
the
brain
through
the
internal
carotid
is
full
of
the
elements
necessary
to
bestir
the
to
their
highest
activity
if
on
the
contrary
anabolism
and
katabolism
are
going
on
ineptly
if
the
blood
is
not
getting
the
supplies
that
it
needs
and
not
getting
rid
of
the
wastes
that
burden
it
then
the
will
be
both
starved
and
poisoned
and
not
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
men
can
make
them
do
their
work
with
any
show
of
ease
and
efficiency
in
the
first
case
the
man
whose
psyche
dwells
in
the
cells
will
have
a
moment
of
inspiration
that
is
he
will
find
it
a
strangely
simple
and
facile
matter
to
write
his
poem
or
iron
out
his
syllogism
or
make
his
bold
modulation
from
f
sharp
minor
to
c
major
or
get
his
or
maybe
only
perfect
his
swindle
but
in
the
second
case
he
will
be
stumped
and
helpless
the
more
he
tries
the
more
vividly
he
will
be
conscious
of
his
impotence
sweat
will
stand
out
in
beads
upon
his
brow
he
will
fish
patiently
for
the
elusive
thought
he
will
try
coaxing
and
subterfuge
he
will
retire
to
his
ivory
tower
he
will
tempt
the
invisible
powers
with
black
coffee
tea
alcohol
and
the
alkaloids
he
may
even
curse
god
and
invite
death
but
he
will
not
write
his
poem
or
iron
out
his
syllogism
or
find
his
way
into
c
major
or
get
his
or
perfect
his
swindle
fix
your
eye
upon
this
hypothesis
of
metabolic
inspiration
and
at
once
you
will
find
the
key
to
many
a
correlative
mystery
for
one
thing
it
quickly
explains
the
observed
hopelessness
of
trying
to
pump
up
inspiration
by
mere
hard
industry
the
essential
imbecility
of
the
words
a
day
formula
let
there
be
stenosis
below
and
not
all
the
industry
of
a
hercules
will
suffice
to
awaken
the
lethargic
brain
here
indeed
the
harder
the
striving
the
worse
the
stagnation
as
every
artist
knows
only
too
well
and
why
not
striving
in
the
face
of
such
an
interior
obstacle
is
the
most
cruel
of
enterprises
a
business
more
and
exhausting
than
reading
a
newspaper
or
watching
a
bad
play
the
pain
thus
produced
the
emotions
thus
engendered
react
upon
the
liver
in
a
manner
scientifically
displayed
by
george
crile
in
his
man
an
adaptive
mechanism
and
the
result
is
a
steady
increase
in
the
intestinal
demoralization
and
a
like
increase
in
the
pollution
of
the
blood
in
the
end
the
poor
victim
comes
to
a
familiar
pass
beset
on
the
one
hand
by
impotence
and
on
the
other
hand
by
an
impatience
grown
pathological
he
gets
into
a
state
indistinguishable
from
the
frantic
it
is
at
such
times
that
creative
artists
suffer
most
atrociously
it
is
then
that
they
writhe
upon
the
sharp
spears
and
hooks
of
a
jealous
and
unjust
creator
for
their
invasion
of
his
monopoly
it
is
then
that
they
pay
a
grisly
upon
their
superiority
to
the
great
herd
of
and
undistinguished
men
the
men
of
this
herd
never
undergo
any
comparable
torture
the
agony
of
the
artist
is
quite
beyond
their
experience
and
even
beyond
their
imagination
no
catastrophe
that
could
conceivably
overtake
a
lime
and
cement
dealer
a
curb
broker
a
lawyer
a
plumber
or
a
presbyterian
is
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
the
torments
that
to
the
most
minor
of
poets
are
familiar
incidents
of
his
professional
life
and
to
such
a
man
as
poe
or
beethoven
or
brahms
are
the
commonplaces
of
every
day
beethoven
suffered
more
during
the
composition
of
the
fifth
symphony
than
all
the
judges
on
the
supreme
benches
of
the
world
have
suffered
jointly
since
the
time
of
the
gerousia
again
my
hypothesis
explains
the
fact
that
inspiration
save
under
extraordinary
circumstances
is
never
continuous
for
more
than
a
relatively
short
period
a
banker
a
barber
or
a
manufacturer
of
patent
medicines
does
his
work
day
after
day
without
any
noticeable
rise
or
fall
of
efficiency
save
when
he
is
drunk
jailed
or
ill
in
bed
the
curve
of
his
achievement
is
flattened
out
until
it
becomes
almost
a
straight
line
but
the
curve
of
an
artist
even
of
the
greatest
of
artists
is
frightfully
there
are
moments
when
it
sinks
below
the
bottom
of
the
chart
and
immediately
following
there
may
be
moments
when
it
threatens
to
run
off
the
top
some
of
the
noblest
passages
written
by
shakespeare
are
in
his
worst
plays
cheek
by
jowl
with
padding
and
banality
some
of
the
worst
music
of
wagner
is
in
his
finest
music
dramas
there
is
indeed
no
such
thing
as
a
flawless
masterpiece
long
labored
it
may
be
gradually
enriched
with
purple
passages
the
high
inspirations
of
widely
separated
times
crowded
together
but
even
so
it
will
remain
spotty
for
those
purple
passages
will
be
clumsily
joined
and
their
joints
will
remain
as
apparent
as
so
many
false
teeth
only
the
most
elementary
knowledge
of
psychology
is
needed
to
show
the
cause
of
the
that
i
have
mentioned
it
lies
in
the
elemental
fact
that
the
chemical
constitution
of
the
blood
changes
every
hour
almost
every
minute
what
it
is
at
the
beginning
of
digestion
is
not
what
it
is
at
the
end
of
digestion
and
in
both
cases
it
is
enormously
affected
by
the
nature
of
the
substances
digested
no
man
within
hours
after
eating
a
meal
in
a
pennsylvania
railroad
could
conceivably
write
anything
worth
reading
a
tough
beefsteak
i
daresay
has
ditched
many
a
promising
sonnet
and
bad
beer
as
every
one
knows
has
spoiled
hundreds
of
sonatas
thus
inspiration
rises
and
falls
and
even
when
it
rises
twice
to
the
same
height
it
usually
shows
some
qualitative
difference
there
is
the
inspiration
say
of
spring
vegetables
and
there
is
the
inspiration
of
autumn
fruits
in
a
long
work
the
products
of
greatly
differing
inspirations
of
greatly
differing
streams
of
blood
are
hideously
intermingled
and
the
result
is
the
inevitable
spottiness
that
i
have
mentioned
no
one
but
a
maniac
argues
that
die
meistersinger
is
good
one
detects
in
it
days
when
wagner
felt
as
the
saying
goes
like
a
fighting
cock
but
one
also
detects
days
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
full
of
acidosis
and
despair
days
when
he
turned
heavily
from
the
pierian
spring
to
castor
oil
moreover
it
must
be
obvious
that
the
very
conditions
under
which
works
of
art
are
produced
tend
to
cause
great
aberrations
in
metabolism
the
artist
is
forced
by
his
calling
to
be
a
sedentary
man
even
a
poet
perhaps
the
freest
of
artists
must
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
bending
over
a
desk
he
may
conceive
his
poems
in
the
open
air
as
beethoven
conceived
his
music
but
the
work
of
reducing
them
to
actual
words
requires
diligent
effort
in
camera
here
it
is
a
sheer
impossibility
for
him
to
enjoy
the
ideal
hygienic
conditions
which
surround
the
farmhand
the
and
the
sailor
his
viscera
are
congested
his
eyes
are
astrain
his
muscles
are
without
necessary
exercise
furthermore
he
probably
breathes
bad
air
and
goes
without
needed
sleep
the
result
is
inevitably
some
disturbance
of
metabolism
with
a
vitiated
blood
supply
and
a
starved
cerebrum
one
is
always
surprised
to
encounter
a
poet
who
is
ruddy
and
stout
the
standard
model
is
a
pale
and
flabby
stenotic
kept
alive
by
patent
medicines
so
with
the
painter
the
musical
composer
the
sculptor
the
artist
in
prose
there
is
no
more
confining
work
known
to
man
than
instrumentation
the
composer
who
has
spent
a
day
at
it
is
invariably
nervous
and
for
hours
his
body
is
bent
over
his
the
while
his
pen
engrosses
little
dots
upon
thin
lines
i
have
known
composers
after
a
week
or
so
of
such
labor
to
come
down
with
in
its
most
virulent
forms
perhaps
the
notorious
ill
health
of
beethoven
and
the
mental
of
schumann
tschaikowsky
and
hugo
wolf
had
their
origin
in
this
direction
it
is
difficult
going
through
the
history
of
music
to
find
a
single
composer
in
the
grand
manner
who
was
physically
and
mentally
up
to
par
i
do
not
advance
it
as
a
formal
corollary
but
no
doubt
this
stenosis
hypothesis
also
throws
some
light
upon
two
other
immemorial
mysteries
the
first
being
the
relative
æsthetic
sterility
of
women
and
the
other
being
the
low
æsthetic
development
of
certain
whole
classes
and
even
races
of
men
the
puritans
the
welsh
and
the
confederate
americans
that
women
suffer
from
stenosis
far
more
than
men
is
a
commonplace
of
internal
medicine
the
weakness
is
chiefly
to
blame
rather
than
the
functional
peculiarities
that
they
accuse
for
their
liability
to
headache
a
good
many
of
them
in
fact
are
habitually
in
the
state
of
health
which
in
the
artist
is
accompanied
by
an
utter
inability
to
work
this
state
of
health
as
i
have
said
does
not
inhibit
mental
activity
it
leaves
the
powers
of
observation
but
little
impaired
it
does
not
corrupt
common
sense
it
is
not
incompatible
with
an
intelligent
discharge
of
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
thus
a
lime
and
cement
dealer
in
the
midst
of
it
may
function
almost
as
well
as
when
his
metabolic
processes
are
perfectly
normal
and
by
the
same
token
a
woman
chronically
a
victim
to
it
may
yet
show
all
the
sharp
mental
competence
which
characterizes
her
sex
but
here
the
thing
stops
to
go
beyond
to
enter
the
realm
of
constructive
thinking
to
abandon
the
mere
application
of
old
ideas
and
essay
to
invent
new
ideas
to
precipitate
novel
and
intellectual
concepts
out
of
the
chaos
of
memory
and
perception
this
is
quite
impossible
to
the
stenotic
it
is
unheard
of
among
classes
and
races
of
men
who
feed
grossly
and
neglect
personal
hygiene
the
is
the
only
artist
in
such
groups
one
may
thus
argue
that
the
elder
beecham
saved
poetry
in
england
as
the
younger
beecham
saved
music
but
as
i
say
i
do
not
stand
behind
the
hypothesis
in
this
department
save
perhaps
in
the
matter
of
women
i
could
amass
enormous
evidences
in
favor
of
it
but
against
them
there
would
always
loom
the
disconcerting
contrary
evidence
of
the
bulgarians
among
them
i
suppose
stenosis
must
be
unknown
but
so
are
all
the
fine
arts

des

science
wastes
itself
hunting
in
the
other
direction
we
are
flooded
with
evidences
of
the
effects
of
the
mind
on
the
body
and
so
our
attention
is
diverted
from
the
enormously
greater
effects
of
the
body
on
the
mind
it
is
rather
astonishing
that
the
wassermann
reaction
has
not
caused
the
latter
to
be
investigated
more
thoroughly
the
first
result
of
the
general
employment
of
that
great
diagnostic
device
was
the
discovery
that
thousands
of
cases
of
mental
disease
were
really
purely
physical
in
origin
that
thousands
of
patients
long
supposed
to
have
been
crazed
by
seeing
ghosts
by
love
by
grief
or
by
reverses
in
the
were
actually
victims
of
the
small
but
extremely
enterprising
the
news
heaved
a
bomb
into
psychiatry
but
it
has
so
far
failed
to
provoke
a
study
of
the
effects
of
other
such
physical
agents
even
the
effects
of
this
one
agent
remain
to
be
inquired
into
at
length
one
now
knows
that
it
may
cause
insanity
but
what
of
the
lesser
mental
aberrations
that
it
produces
some
of
these
aberrations
may
be
actually
beneficial
that
is
to
say
the
mild
toxemia
accompanying
the
less
virulent
forms
of
infection
may
stimulate
the
brain
to
its
highest
functioning
and
so
give
birth
to
what
is
called
genius
a
state
of
mind
long
recognized
by
popular
empiricism
as
a
sort
of
station
on
the
road
to
insanity
beethoven
nietzsche
and
schopenhauer
suffered
from
such
mild
toxemias
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
their
extraordinary
mental
activity
was
at
least
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
tuberculosis
in
its
early
stages
is
capable
of
the
same
stimulation
is
a
commonplace
of
observation
the
consumptive
may
be
weak
physically
but
he
is
usually
very
alert
mentally
the
history
of
the
arts
in
fact
shows
the
names
of
hundreds
of
inspired
consumptives
here
a
physical
infirmity
produces
a
result
that
is
beneficial
just
as
another
physical
infirmity
the
stenosis
aforesaid
produces
a
result
that
is
baleful
the
artist
often
oscillates
horribly
between
the
two
effects
he
is
normally
anything
but
a
healthy
animal
perfect
health
indeed
is
a
boon
that
very
few
men
above
the
rank
of
clodhoppers
ever
enjoy
what
health
means
is
a
degree
of
adaptation
to
the
organism
environment
so
nearly
complete
that
there
is
no
irritation
such
a
state
it
must
be
obvious
is
not
often
to
be
observed
in
organisms
of
the
highest
complexity
it
is
common
perhaps
in
the
earthworm
this
elemental
beast
makes
few
demands
upon
its
environment
and
is
thus
subject
to
few
diseases
it
seldom
gets
out
of
order
until
the
sands
of
its
life
are
run
and
then
it
suffers
one
grand
illness
and
dies
forthwith
but
man
is
forever
getting
out
of
order
for
he
is
enormously
complicated
and
the
higher
he
rises
in
complexity
the
more
numerous
and
the
more
serious
are
his
derangements
there
are
whole
categories
of
diseases
neurasthenia
and
that
afflict
chiefly
the
more
civilized
and
delicate
ranks
of
men
leaving
the
inferior
orders
unscathed
good
health
in
man
indeed
is
almost
invariably
a
function
of
inferiority
a
professionally
healthy
man
an
acrobat
an
osteopath
or
an
driver
is
always
stupid
in
the
greece
of
the
great
days
the
athletes
we
hear
so
much
about
were
mainly
slaves
not
one
of
the
eminent
philosophers
poets
or
statesmen
of
greece
was
a
good
nearly
all
of
them
in
fact
suffered
from
the
same
malaises
which
afflict
their
successors
of
as
you
will
quickly
discern
by
examining
their
compositions
the
æsthetic
impulse
like
the
thirst
for
truth
might
almost
be
called
a
disease
it
seldom
if
ever
appears
in
a
perfectly
healthy
man
but
we
must
take
the
aloes
with
the
honey
the
artist
suffers
damnably
but
there
is
compensation
in
his
dreams
some
of
his
characteristic
diseases
cripple
him
and
make
his
whole
life
a
misery
but
there
are
others
that
seem
to
help
him
of
the
latter
the
two
that
i
have
mentioned
carry
with
them
concepts
of
extreme
obnoxiousness
both
are
infections
and
one
is
associated
in
the
popular
mind
with
notions
or
gross
immorality
but
these
concepts
of
obnoxiousness
should
not
blind
us
to
the
benefits
that
apparently
go
with
the
maladies
there
are
in
fact
maladies
much
more
obnoxious
and
they
carry
no
compensating
benefits
cancer
is
an
example
perhaps
the
time
will
come
when
the
precise
effects
of
these
diseases
will
be
worked
out
accurately
and
it
will
be
possible
to
gauge
in
advance
their
probable
influence
upon
this
or
that
individual
if
that
time
ever
comes
the
manufacture
of
artists
will
become
a
feasible
procedure
like
the
present
manufacture
of
soldiers
capons
and
doctors
of
philosophy
in
those
days
the
promising
young
men
of
the
race
instead
of
being
protected
from
such
diseases
at
all
hazards
will
be
deliberately
infected
with
them
as
soils
are
now
inoculated
with
bacteria
at
the
same
time
let
us
hope
some
progress
will
be
made
against
stenosis
it
is
after
all
simply
a
question
of
technique
like
the
artificial
propagation
of
the
race
by
the
device
of
jacques
loeb
the
poet
of
the
future
come
upon
a
period
of
doldrums
will
not
tear
his
hair
in
futile
agony
instead
he
will
go
to
the
nearest
clinic
and
there
get
his
rasher
of
bulgarian
bacilli
or
an
injection
of
some
complex
organic
compound
out
of
a
ductless
gland
or
an
order
on
a
masseur
or
a
diet
list
or
perchance
a
barrel
of
russian
oil
scientific
examination
of
a
popular
virtue
an
old
assaulting
my
ear
lately
with
an
abstruse
tale
of
his
sister
husband
brother
ingratitude
ended
by
driving
me
quite
out
of
his
house
firmly
resolved
to
be
his
acquaintance
no
longer
the
exact
offense
i
heard
inattentively
and
have
already
partly
forgotten
an
obscure
tort
arising
out
of
a
lawsuit
my
it
appears
was
appealed
to
for
help
in
a
bad
case
by
his
grapevine
relative
and
so
went
on
the
stand
for
him
and
swore
gallantly
to
some
complex
and
unintelligible
lie
later
on
essaying
to
cash
in
on
the
perjury
he
asked
the
fellow
to
aid
him
in
some
domestic
unpleasantness
and
was
refused
on
grounds
of
morals
hence
his
indignation
and
my
spoiled
evening
what
is
one
to
think
of
a
man
so
asinine
that
he
looks
for
gratitude
in
this
world
or
so
puerilely
egotistical
that
he
enjoys
it
when
found
the
truth
is
that
the
sentiment
itself
is
not
human
but
doggish
and
that
the
man
who
demands
it
in
payment
for
his
doings
is
precisely
the
sort
of
man
who
feels
noble
and
distinguished
when
a
dog
licks
his
hand
what
a
man
says
when
he
expresses
gratitude
is
simply
this
you
did
something
for
me
that
i
could
not
have
done
myself
you
are
my
superior
hail
such
a
confession
whether
true
or
not
is
degrading
to
the
confessor
and
so
it
is
very
hard
to
make
at
all
events
for
a
man
of
that
is
why
such
a
man
always
makes
it
clumsily
and
with
many
blushes
and
hesitations
it
is
hard
for
him
to
put
so
embarrassing
a
doctrine
into
plain
words
and
that
is
why
the
business
is
equally
uncomfortable
to
the
party
of
the
other
part
it
distresses
him
to
see
a
human
being
of
decent
instincts
standing
before
him
in
so
ignominious
a
position
he
is
as
flustered
as
if
the
fellow
came
in
handcuffs
or
in
rags
or
wearing
the
stripes
of
a
felon
moreover
his
confusion
is
helped
out
by
his
inward
knowledge
very
clear
if
he
is
introspective
and
plain
enough
even
if
he
is
not
that
he
really
deserves
no
such
tribute
to
his
high
mightiness
that
the
altruism
for
which
he
is
being
praised
was
really
bogus
that
he
did
the
thing
behind
the
gratitude
which
now
assails
him
not
for
any
grand
and
lofty
reason
but
for
a
purely
selfish
and
inferior
reason
to
wit
for
the
reason
that
it
pleases
all
of
us
to
show
what
we
can
do
when
an
appreciative
audience
is
present
that
we
delight
to
exercise
our
will
to
power
when
it
is
safe
and
profitable
this
is
the
primary
cause
of
the
benefits
which
inspire
gratitude
real
and
pretended
this
is
the
fact
at
the
bottom
of
altruism
find
me
a
man
who
is
always
doing
favors
for
people
and
i
will
show
you
a
man
of
petty
vanity
forever
trying
to
get
fuel
for
it
in
the
cheapest
way
and
find
me
a
man
who
is
notoriously
grateful
in
habit
and
show
you
a
man
who
is
essentially
third
rate
and
who
is
conscious
of
it
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
the
man
of
genuine
which
means
the
man
who
is
more
or
less
accurately
aware
not
only
of
his
own
value
but
also
and
more
importantly
of
his
own
limitations
tries
to
avoid
entering
either
class
he
hesitates
to
demonstrate
his
superiority
by
such
banal
means
and
he
shrinks
from
confessing
an
inferiority
that
he
does
believe
in
nevertheless
the
popular
morality
of
the
world
which
is
the
creation
not
of
its
superior
men
but
of
its
botches
and
in
brief
of
its
majorities
puts
a
high
value
on
gratitude
and
denounces
the
of
it
as
an
offense
against
the
proprieties
to
be
noticeably
ungrateful
for
benefits
that
is
for
the
of
the
egotism
of
others
is
to
be
disliked
to
tell
a
tale
of
ingratitude
is
to
take
on
the
aspect
of
a
martyr
to
the
defects
of
others
to
get
sympathy
in
an
affliction
all
of
us
are
responsive
to
such
ideas
however
much
we
may
resent
them
logically
one
may
no
more
live
in
the
world
without
picking
up
the
moral
prejudices
of
the
world
than
one
will
be
able
to
go
to
hell
without
perspiring
let
me
recall
a
case
within
my
own
recent
experience
one
day
i
received
a
letter
from
a
young
woman
i
had
never
heard
of
before
asking
me
to
read
the
manuscripts
of
two
novels
that
she
had
written
she
represented
that
she
had
venerated
my
critical
parts
for
a
long
while
and
that
her
whole
future
career
in
letters
would
be
determined
by
my
decision
as
to
her
talents
the
daughter
of
a
man
apparently
of
some
consequence
in
some
sordid
business
or
other
she
asked
me
to
meet
her
at
her
father
office
and
there
to
impart
to
her
under
socially
aseptic
conditions
my
advice
having
a
standing
rule
against
meeting
women
authors
even
in
their
fathers
banks
and
soap
factories
i
pleaded
various
imaginary
engagements
but
finally
agreed
after
a
telephone
debate
to
read
her
manuscripts
they
arrived
promptly
and
i
found
them
to
be
wholly
without
merit
in
fact
the
veriest
twaddle
nevertheless
i
plowed
through
them
diligently
wasted
half
an
hour
at
the
job
wrote
a
polite
letter
of
counsel
and
returned
the
manuscripts
to
her
house
paying
a
blackamoor
cents
to
haul
them
by
all
ordinary
standards
an
altruistic
service
and
well
deserving
some
show
of
gratitude
had
she
knitted
me
a
pair
of
it
would
have
seemed
meet
and
proper
even
a
copy
of
the
poems
of
alfred
noyes
would
not
have
been
too
much
at
the
very
least
i
expected
a
note
of
thanks
well
not
a
word
has
ever
reached
me
for
all
my
laborious
politeness
and
disagreeable
labor
my
reward
is
exactly
nil
the
lady
is
improved
by
my
counsel
and
i
am
shocked
by
her
gross
ingratitude
that
is
conventionally
superficially
as
a
member
of
society
in
good
standing
but
when
on
sour
afternoons
i
roll
the
affair
in
my
mind
examining
not
the
mere
surface
of
it
but
the
inner
workings
and
anatomy
of
it
my
sense
of
outrage
gradually
melts
and
fades
away
the
inevitable
recompense
of
skepticism
what
i
see
clearly
is
that
i
was
an
ass
to
succumb
to
the
blandishments
of
this
discourteous
miss
and
that
she
was
quite
right
in
estimating
my
service
trivially
and
out
of
that
clear
seeing
comes
consolation
and
amusement
and
in
the
end
even
satisfaction
i
got
exactly
what
i
deserved
and
she
whether
consciously
or
merely
instinctively
measured
out
the
dose
with
excellent
accuracy
let
us
go
back
why
did
i
waste
two
hours
or
maybe
three
reading
those
idiotic
manuscripts
why
in
the
first
place
did
i
answer
her
opening
request
the
request
so
inherently
absurd
that
i
meet
her
in
her
father
office
for
a
very
plain
reason
she
accompanied
it
with
flattery
what
she
said
in
effect
was
that
she
regarded
me
as
a
critic
of
the
highest
talents
and
this
ludicrous
cajolery
sound
i
dare
say
in
substance
but
reduced
to
naught
by
her
obvious
obscurity
and
stupidity
was
quite
enough
to
fetch
me
in
brief
she
assumed
that
being
a
man
i
was
vain
to
the
point
of
imbecility
and
this
assumption
was
correct
as
it
always
is
to
help
out
there
was
the
concept
of
romantic
adventure
vaguely
floating
in
my
mind
her
voice
as
i
heard
it
by
telephone
was
agreeable
her
appearance
since
she
seemed
eager
to
show
herself
i
probably
judged
subconsciously
to
be
at
least
not
revolting
thus
curiosity
got
on
its
legs
and
vanity
in
another
form
am
i
fat
and
half
decrepit
a
man
seldom
noticed
by
cuties
then
so
much
the
more
reason
why
i
should
respond
the
novelty
of
an
apparently
comely
and
respectable
woman
desiring
to
witness
me
finished
what
the
primary
and
very
crude
appeal
to
my
vanity
had
begun
i
was
in
brief
not
only
the
literary
popinjay
but
also
the
eternal
male
and
hard
at
the
immemorial
folly
of
the
order
now
turn
to
the
gal
and
her
ingratitude
the
more
i
inspect
it
the
more
i
became
convinced
that
it
is
not
discreditable
to
her
but
highly
creditable
that
she
demonstrates
a
certain
human
dignity
despite
her
imbecile
writings
by
exhibiting
it
would
a
show
of
gratitude
put
her
in
a
better
light
i
doubt
it
that
gratitude
considering
the
unfavorable
report
i
made
on
her
manuscripts
would
be
doubly
invasive
of
her
on
the
one
hand
it
would
involve
a
confession
that
my
opinion
of
her
literary
gifts
was
better
than
her
own
and
that
i
was
thus
her
superior
and
on
the
other
hand
it
would
involve
a
confession
that
my
own
actual
writings
being
got
into
print
without
aid
were
better
than
hers
and
that
i
was
thus
her
superior
again
each
confession
would
bring
her
into
an
attitude
of
abasement
and
the
two
together
would
make
her
position
intolerable
moreover
both
would
be
dishonest
she
would
privately
believe
in
neither
doctrine
as
for
my
opinion
its
hostility
to
her
aspiration
is
obviously
enough
to
make
her
ego
dismiss
it
as
false
for
no
organism
acquiesces
in
its
own
destruction
and
as
for
my
relative
worth
as
a
literary
artist
she
must
inevitably
put
it
very
low
for
it
depends
in
the
last
analysis
upon
my
dignity
and
sagacity
as
a
man
and
she
has
proved
by
experiment
and
quite
easily
that
i
am
almost
as
susceptible
to
flattery
as
a
moving
picture
actor
and
hence
surely
no
great
shakes
thus
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
in
the
world
why
the
fair
creature
should
knit
me
a
pair
of
or
send
me
the
poems
of
noyes
or
even
write
me
a
polite
note
if
she
did
any
of
these
things
she
would
feel
herself
a
hypocrite
and
hence
stand
embarrassed
before
the
mirror
of
her
own
thoughts
confronted
by
a
choice
between
this
sort
of
shame
and
the
incomparably
less
uncomfortable
shame
of
violating
a
social
convention
and
an
article
of
popular
morals
secretly
and
without
danger
of
exposure
she
very
sensibly
chooses
the
more
innocuous
of
the
two
at
the
very
start
indeed
she
set
up
barriers
against
gratitude
for
her
decision
to
ask
a
favor
of
me
was
in
a
subtle
sense
a
judgment
of
my
inferiority
one
does
not
ask
favors
if
it
can
be
avoided
of
persons
one
genuinely
respects
one
puts
such
burdens
upon
the
naïve
and
colorless
upon
what
are
called
the
good
natured
in
brief
upon
one
inferiors
when
that
girl
first
thought
of
me
as
a
possible
aid
to
her
literary
aspiration
she
thought
of
me
perhaps
vaguely
but
none
the
less
certainly
as
an
inferior
fortuitously
outfitted
with
a
body
of
puerile
technical
information
and
competence
of
probable
use
to
her
this
unfavorable
view
was
immediately
reënforced
by
her
discovery
of
my
vanity
in
brief
she
showed
and
still
shows
the
great
instinctive
sapience
of
her
sex
she
is
female
and
hence
far
above
the
nonsensical
delusions
vanities
conventions
and
moralities
of
men
vi
exeunt
omnes
one
of
the
hardest
jobs
that
faces
an
american
magazine
editor
in
this
the
year
of
the
republic
is
that
of
keeping
the
minnesingers
of
the
land
from
filling
his
magazine
with
lugubrious
dithyrambs
to
on
and
against
somatic
death
of
spiritual
death
of
course
not
many
of
them
ever
sing
most
of
them
in
fact
deny
its
existence
in
plain
terms
they
are
all
sure
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
in
particular
they
are
absolutely
sure
of
the
immortality
of
their
own
souls
and
of
those
of
their
best
girls
in
this
department
the
most
they
ever
allow
to
the
materialism
of
the
herds
that
lie
bogged
in
prose
is
such
a
benefit
of
the
half
doubt
as
one
finds
in
christina
rossetti
when
i
am
dead
but
when
it
comes
to
somatic
death
the
plain
brutal
death
of
coroners
inquests
and
vital
statistics
their
optimism
vanishes
and
try
as
they
may
they
ca
get
around
the
harsh
fact
that
on
such
and
such
a
day
often
appallingly
near
each
and
every
one
of
us
will
heave
a
last
sigh
roll
his
eyes
despairingly
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
then
suddenly
change
from
a
proud
and
highly
complex
mammal
made
in
the
image
of
god
to
a
mere
inert
aggregate
of
disintegrating
colloids
made
in
the
image
of
a
stale
cabbage
the
inevitability
of
it
seems
to
fascinate
them
they
write
about
it
more
than
they
write
about
anything
else
save
love
every
day
my
editorial
desk
is
burdened
with
their
manuscripts
poems
in
which
the
poet
serves
notice
that
when
his
time
comes
he
will
die
bravely
and
even
a
bit
insolently
poems
in
which
he
warns
his
mistress
that
he
will
wait
for
her
on
the
roof
of
the
cosmos
and
keep
his
harp
in
tune
poems
in
which
he
asks
her
grandly
to
forget
him
and
above
all
to
avoid
torturing
herself
by
vain
repining
at
his
grave
poems
in
which
he
directs
his
heirs
and
assigns
to
bury
him
in
some
lonely
romantic
spot
where
the
whippoorwills
sing
poems
in
which
he
hints
that
he
will
not
rest
easily
if
philistines
are
permitted
to
begaud
his
last
anchorage
with
des
perles
poems
in
which
he
speaks
jauntily
of
making
a
with
death
as
if
death
were
a
wench
poems
in
which
but
there
is
no
need
to
rehearse
the
varieties
if
you
read
the
strophes
that
are
strung
along
the
bottoms
of
magazine
pages
you
are
familiar
with
all
of
them
even
in
the
great
moral
periodical
that
i
help
to
edit
despite
my
own
excessive
watchfulness
and
general
theory
that
both
death
and
poetry
are
nuisances
and
in
bad
taste
they
have
appeared
multitudinously
no
doubt
to
the
disgust
of
the
as
i
say
it
is
almost
impossible
to
keep
the
minnesingers
off
the
subject
when
my
negro
flops
the
morning
bale
of
poetry
manuscripts
upon
my
desk
and
i
pull
up
my
chair
to
have
at
them
i
always
make
a
bet
with
myself
that
of
the
first
dozen
at
least
seven
will
deal
with
death
and
it
is
so
long
since
i
lost
that
i
do
remember
it
periodically
i
send
out
a
circular
to
all
the
recognized
poets
of
the
land
begging
them
in
the
name
of
god
to
be
less
mortuary
but
it
never
does
any
good
more
i
doubt
that
it
ever
will
or
any
other
sort
of
appeal
take
away
death
and
love
and
you
would
rob
poets
of
both
their
liver
and
their
lights
what
would
remain
would
be
little
more
than
a
feeble
gurgle
in
an
illimitable
void
for
the
business
of
poetry
remember
is
to
set
up
a
sweet
denial
of
the
harsh
facts
that
confront
all
of
us
to
soothe
us
in
our
agonies
with
emollient
words
in
brief
to
lie
sonorously
and
reassuringly
well
what
is
the
worst
curse
of
life
answer
the
abominable
magnetism
that
draws
unlikes
and
incompatibles
into
delirious
and
intolerable
conjunction
the
kinetic
called
love
and
what
is
the
next
worst
answer
the
fear
of
death
no
wonder
the
poets
give
so
much
attention
to
both
no
other
foe
of
human
peace
and
happiness
is
so
potent
and
hence
none
other
offers
such
opportunities
to
poetry
and
in
fact
to
all
art
a
sonnet
designed
to
ease
the
dread
of
bankruptcy
even
if
done
by
a
great
master
would
be
banal
for
that
dread
is
itself
banal
and
so
is
bankruptcy
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
old
fear
of
hell
now
no
more
there
was
a
day
when
this
latter
raged
in
the
breast
of
nearly
every
man
and
in
that
day
the
poets
produced
antidotes
that
were
very
fine
poems
but
only
the
elect
and
anointed
of
god
fear
hell
and
so
there
is
no
more
production
of
sound
poetry
in
that
department
as
i
have
hinted
i
tire
of
reading
so
much
necrotic
verse
in
manuscript
and
wish
heartily
that
the
poets
would
cease
to
assault
me
with
it
in
prose
curiously
enough
one
observes
a
corresponding
shortage
true
enough
the
short
story
of
commerce
shows
a
good
many
murders
and
suicides
and
not
less
than
eight
times
a
day
i
am
made
privy
to
the
agonies
of
a
widower
or
widow
who
on
searching
the
papers
of
his
wife
or
her
husband
immediately
after
her
or
his
death
discovers
that
she
or
he
had
a
lover
or
a
mistress
but
i
speak
of
serious
prose
not
of
trade
balderdash
go
to
any
public
library
and
look
under
death
human
in
the
card
index
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
few
books
there
are
on
the
subject
worse
nearly
all
the
few
are
by
psychical
researchers
who
regard
death
as
a
mere
removal
from
one
world
to
another
or
by
new
thoughters
who
appear
to
believe
that
it
is
little
more
than
a
sort
of
illusion
once
seeking
to
find
out
what
death
was
physiologically
that
is
to
find
out
just
what
happened
when
a
man
died
i
put
in
a
solid
week
without
result
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
whatever
on
the
subject
even
in
the
medical
libraries
finally
after
much
weariness
i
found
what
i
was
looking
for
in
george
crile
man
an
adaptive
mechanism
incidentally
a
very
solid
and
original
work
much
less
heard
of
than
it
ought
to
be
crile
said
that
death
was
acidosis
that
it
was
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
organism
to
maintain
the
alkalinity
necessary
to
its
normal
functioning
and
in
the
absence
of
any
proofs
or
even
arguments
to
the
contrary
i
accepted
his
notion
forthwith
and
have
held
to
it
ever
since
i
thus
think
of
death
as
a
sort
of
deleterious
fermentation
like
that
which
goes
on
in
a
bottle
of
château
margaux
when
it
becomes
corked
life
is
a
struggle
not
against
sin
not
against
the
money
power
not
against
malicious
animal
magnetism
but
against
hydrogen
ions
the
healthy
man
is
one
in
whom
those
ions
as
they
are
dissociated
by
cellular
activity
are
immediately
fixed
by
alkaline
bases
the
sick
man
is
one
in
whom
the
process
has
begun
to
lag
with
the
hydrogen
ions
getting
ahead
the
dying
man
is
one
in
whom
it
is
all
over
save
the
charges
of
fraud
but
here
i
get
into
chemical
physics
and
not
only
run
afoul
of
revelation
but
also
reveal
perhaps
a
degree
of
ignorance
verging
upon
intellectual
coma
the
thing
i
started
out
to
do
was
to
call
attention
to
the
only
and
treatise
on
death
that
i
have
ever
encountered
or
heard
of
to
wit
aspects
of
death
and
correlated
aspects
of
life
by
parkes
weber
a
fat
hefty
and
extremely
interesting
tome
the
fruit
of
truly
stupendous
erudition
what
weber
has
attempted
is
to
bring
together
in
one
volume
all
that
has
been
said
or
thought
about
death
since
the
time
of
the
first
human
records
not
only
by
poets
priests
and
philosophers
but
also
by
painters
engravers
soldiers
monarchs
and
the
populace
generally
the
author
i
take
it
is
primarily
a
numismatist
and
he
apparently
began
his
work
with
a
collection
of
inscriptions
on
coins
and
medals
but
as
it
stands
it
covers
a
vastly
wider
area
one
traces
in
chapter
after
chapter
the
ebb
and
flow
of
human
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
the
human
attitude
to
the
last
and
greatest
mystery
of
them
all
the
notion
of
it
as
a
mere
transition
to
a
higher
plane
of
life
the
notion
of
it
as
a
benign
panacea
for
all
human
suffering
the
notion
of
it
as
an
incentive
to
this
or
that
way
of
living
the
notion
of
it
as
an
impenetrable
enigma
inevitable
and
inexplicable
few
of
us
quite
realize
how
much
the
contemplation
of
death
has
colored
human
thought
throughout
the
ages
there
have
been
times
when
it
almost
shut
out
all
other
concerns
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
it
has
not
bulked
enormously
in
the
racial
consciousness
well
what
weber
does
in
his
book
is
to
detach
and
set
forth
the
salient
ideas
that
have
emerged
from
all
that
consideration
and
discussion
to
isolate
the
chief
theories
of
death
ancient
and
modern
pagan
and
christian
scientific
and
mystical
sound
and
absurd
the
material
thus
digested
is
appallingly
copious
if
the
learned
author
had
confined
himself
to
printed
books
alone
he
would
have
faced
a
labor
fit
for
a
new
hercules
but
in
addition
to
books
he
has
given
his
attention
to
prints
to
medals
to
paintings
to
engraved
gems
and
to
monumental
inscriptions
his
authorities
range
from
john
on
what
is
to
happen
at
the
day
of
judgment
to
sir
william
osier
on
what
happens
upon
the
normal
human
and
from
socrates
on
the
relation
of
death
to
philosophy
to
havelock
ellis
on
the
effects
of
christian
ideas
of
death
upon
the
mediæval
temperament
the
one
field
that
weber
has
overlooked
is
that
of
music
a
somewhat
serious
omission
it
is
hard
to
think
of
a
great
composer
who
never
wrote
a
funeral
march
or
a
requiem
or
at
least
a
sad
song
to
some
departed
love
even
old
papa
haydn
had
moments
when
he
ceased
to
be
merry
and
let
his
thought
turn
stealthily
upon
the
doom
ahead
to
me
at
all
events
the
slow
movement
of
the
military
symphony
is
the
saddest
of
music
an
elegy
i
take
it
on
some
young
fellow
who
went
out
in
the
incomprehensible
wars
of
those
times
and
got
himself
horribly
killed
in
a
far
place
the
trumpet
blasts
towards
the
end
fling
themselves
over
his
hasty
grave
in
a
remote
cabbage
field
one
hears
before
and
after
them
the
honest
weeping
of
his
comrades
into
their
in
truth
the
shadow
of
death
hangs
over
all
the
music
of
haydn
despite
its
lightheartedness
life
was
gay
in
those
last
days
of
the
holy
roman
empire
but
it
was
also
precarious
if
the
turks
were
not
at
the
gate
then
there
was
a
peasant
rising
somewhere
in
the
hinterland
or
a
pestilence
swept
the
land
beethoven
a
generation
later
growled
at
death
surlily
but
haydn
faced
it
like
a
gentleman
the
romantic
movement
brought
a
sentimentalization
of
the
tragedy
it
became
a
sort
of
orgy
whenever
wagner
dealt
with
death
he
treated
it
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
gaudy
tournament
a
thing
less
dreadful
than
ecstatic
consider
for
example
the
music
in
parsifal
death
music
for
the
most
memorable
death
in
the
history
of
the
world
surely
no
one
hearing
it
for
the
first
time
without
previous
warning
would
guess
that
it
had
to
do
with
anything
so
gruesome
as
a
crucifixion
on
the
contrary
i
have
a
notion
that
the
average
auditor
would
guess
that
it
was
a
musical
setting
for
some
lamentable
fornication
between
a
bayreuth
baritone
seven
feet
in
height
and
a
german
soprano
weighing
at
least
three
hundred
pounds
but
if
weber
thus
neglects
music
he
at
least
gives
full
measure
in
all
other
departments
his
book
in
fact
is
encyclopædic
he
almost
exhausts
the
subject
one
idea
however
i
do
not
find
in
it
the
conception
of
death
as
the
last
and
worst
of
all
the
practical
jokes
played
upon
poor
mortals
by
the
gods
that
idea
apparently
never
occurred
to
the
greeks
who
thought
of
almost
everything
but
nevertheless
it
has
an
ingratiating
plausibility
the
hardest
thing
about
death
is
not
that
men
die
tragically
but
that
most
of
them
die
ridiculously
if
it
were
possible
for
all
of
us
to
make
our
exits
at
great
moments
swiftly
cleanly
decorously
and
in
fine
attitudes
then
the
experience
would
be
something
to
face
heroically
and
with
high
and
beautiful
words
but
we
commonly
go
off
in
no
such
gorgeous
poetical
way
instead
we
die
in
raucous
prose
of
of
diabetes
of
toxemia
of
a
noisome
perforation
in
the
region
of
carcinoma
of
the
liver
the
abominable
acidosis
of
crile
sneaks
upon
us
gradually
paralyzing
the
adrenals
flabbergasting
the
thyroid
crippling
the
poor
old
liver
and
throwing
its
fog
upon
the
brain
thus
the
ontogenetic
process
is
recapitulated
in
reverse
order
and
we
pass
into
the
mental
obscurity
of
infancy
and
then
into
the
blank
unconsciousness
of
the
prenatal
state
and
finally
into
the
condition
of
undifferentiated
protoplasm
a
man
does
not
die
quickly
and
brilliantly
like
a
lightning
stroke
he
passes
out
by
inches
hesitatingly
and
one
may
almost
add
gingerly
it
is
hard
to
say
just
when
he
is
fully
dead
long
after
his
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
and
his
lungs
have
ceased
to
swell
him
up
with
the
vanity
of
his
species
there
are
remote
and
obscure
parts
of
him
that
still
live
on
quite
unconcerned
about
the
central
catastrophe
alexis
carrel
has
cut
them
out
and
kept
them
alive
for
months
the
hair
keeps
on
growing
for
a
long
while
every
time
another
one
of
the
corpses
of
barbarossa
or
king
james
i
is
examined
it
is
found
that
the
hair
is
longer
than
it
was
the
last
time
no
doubt
there
are
many
parts
of
the
body
and
perhaps
even
whole
organs
which
wonder
what
it
is
all
about
when
they
find
that
they
are
on
the
way
to
the
crematory
burn
a
man
mortal
remains
and
you
inevitably
burn
a
good
portion
of
him
alive
and
no
doubt
that
portion
sends
alarmed
messages
to
the
unconscious
brain
like
dissected
tissue
under
anæsthesia
and
the
resultant
shock
brings
the
deceased
before
the
hierarchy
of
heaven
in
a
state
of
collapse
with
his
face
white
sweat
bespangling
his
forehead
and
a
great
thirst
upon
him
it
would
not
be
pulling
the
nose
of
reason
to
argue
that
many
a
cremated
thus
confronting
the
ultimate
tribunal
in
the
aspect
of
a
man
taken
with
the
goods
has
been
put
down
as
suffering
from
an
uneasy
conscience
when
what
actually
ailed
him
was
simply
surgical
shock
the
cosmic
process
is
not
only
incurably
idiotic
it
is
also
indecently
unjust
but
here
i
become
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
began
was
this
that
the
human
tendency
to
make
death
dramatic
and
heroic
has
little
excuse
in
the
facts
no
doubt
you
remember
the
scene
in
the
last
act
of
hedda
gabier
in
which
brack
comes
in
with
the
news
of
lövborg
suicide
hedda
immediately
thinks
of
him
putting
the
pistol
to
his
temple
and
dying
instantly
and
magnificently
the
picture
fills
her
with
romantic
delight
when
brack
tells
her
that
the
shot
was
actually
through
the
breast
she
is
disappointed
but
soon
begins
to
romanticise
even
the
breast
she
says
is
also
a
good
place
there
is
something
beautiful
in
this
a
bit
later
she
recurs
to
the
charming
theme
in
the
breast
ah
then
brack
tells
her
the
plain
truth
in
the
original
thus
nej
det
traf
ham
i
underlivet
edmund
gosse
in
his
first
english
translation
of
the
play
made
the
sentence
no
it
struck
him
in
the
abdomen
in
the
last
edition
william
archer
makes
it
no
in
the
bowels

what
brack
wants
to
convey
to
hedda
is
the
news
that
lövborg
death
was
not
romantic
in
the
least
that
he
went
to
a
brothel
shot
himself
not
through
the
cerebrum
or
the
heart
but
through
the
duodenum
or
perhaps
the
jejunum
and
is
at
the
moment
of
report
awaiting
autopsy
at
the
christiania
the
shock
floors
her
but
it
is
a
shock
that
all
of
us
must
learn
to
bear
men
upon
whom
we
lavish
our
veneration
reduce
it
to
an
absurdity
at
the
end
by
dying
of
chronic
cystitis
or
by
choking
upon
marshmallows
or
dill
pickles
or
as
the
result
of
getting
cut
by
dirty
barbers
women
whom
we
place
upon
pedestals
worthy
of
the
holy
saints
come
down
at
last
with
mastoid
abscesses
or
die
obscenely
of
hiccoughs
and
we
ourselves
let
us
not
have
too
much
hope
the
chances
are
that
if
we
go
to
war
eager
to
leap
superbly
at
the
cannon
mouth
we
be
finished
on
the
way
by
an
ingrowing
toenail
or
by
being
run
over
by
an
army
truck
driven
by
a
former
greek
and
loaded
with
imitation
swiss
cheeses
made
in
oneida
y
and
that
if
we
die
in
our
beds
it
will
be
of
measles
or
albuminuria
the
aforesaid
crile
in
one
of
his
smaller
books
a
mechanistic
view
of
war
and
peace
has
a
good
deal
to
say
about
death
in
war
and
in
particular
about
the
disparity
between
the
glorious
and
inspiring
passing
imagined
by
the
young
soldier
and
the
messy
finish
that
is
normally
in
store
for
him
he
shows
two
pictures
of
war
the
one
ideal
and
the
other
real
the
former
is
the
familiar
print
the
spirit
of
with
the
three
patriots
springing
grandly
to
the
attack
one
of
them
with
a
neat
and
romantic
bandage
around
his
head
apparently
to
judge
by
his
liveliness
to
cover
a
wound
no
worse
than
an
average
the
latter
picture
is
what
the
movie
folks
call
a
of
a
french
soldier
who
was
struck
just
below
the
mouth
by
a
german
shell
a
soldier
suddenly
converted
into
the
hideous
simulacrum
of
a
cruller
what
one
notices
especially
is
the
curious
expression
upon
what
remains
of
his
face
an
expression
of
the
utmost
surprise
and
indignation
no
doubt
he
marched
off
to
the
front
firmly
convinced
that
if
he
died
at
all
it
would
be
at
the
climax
of
some
heroic
charge
up
to
his
knees
in
blood
and
with
his
bayonet
run
clear
through
a
bavarian
at
least
four
feet
in
diameter
he
imagined
the
clean
bullet
through
the
heart
the
stately
last
gesture
the
final
words

go
to
the
book
and
see
what
he
got
crile
whose
experience
of
war
has
soured
him
against
it
argues
that
the
best
way
to
abolish
it
would
be
to
prohibit
such
romantic
prints
as
the
spirit
of
and
substitute
therefor
a
series
of
actual
photographs
of
dead
and
wounded
men
the
plan
is
plainly
of
merit
but
it
would
be
expensive
imagine
a
war
getting
on
its
legs
before
the
conversion
of
the
populace
had
become
think
of
the
huge
herds
of
burlesons
and
other
such
operators
that
it
would
take
to
track
down
and
confiscate
all
those
pictures
even
so
the
vulgar
horror
of
death
would
remain
for
as
ellen
la
motte
well
says
in
her
little
book
the
backwash
of
war
the
finish
of
a
civilian
in
a
luxurious
hospital
with
trained
nurses
fluttering
over
him
and
his
pastor
whooping
and
heaving
for
him
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
is
often
quite
as
terrible
as
any
form
of
exitus
witnessed
in
war
it
is
in
fact
always
an
unpleasant
business
let
the
poets
disguise
it
all
they
may
and
the
theologians
obscure
the
issue
with
promises
of
felicity
the
plain
truth
remains
that
it
gives
one
pause
to
reflect
that
on
some
day
not
far
away
one
must
yield
supinely
to
acidosis
sink
into
the
mental
darkness
of
an
idiot
and
so
suffer
a
withdrawal
from
these
engaging
scenes
no
says
the
nurse
in
faded
pink
tripping
down
the
corridor
with
a
hooch
of
rye
for
the
diabetic
in
no
has
just
passed
out
which
is
no
asks
the
new
nurse
the
one
whose
wife
wore
that
awful
hat
this
afternoon
but
all
the
authorities
it
is
pleasant
to
know
report
that
the
final
scene
is
placid
enough
weber
quotes
many
of
them
the
dying
man
struggle
much
and
he
is
much
afraid
as
his
alkalies
give
out
he
succumbs
to
a
blest
stupidity
his
mind
fogs
his
will
power
vanishes
he
submits
decently
he
scarcely
gives
a
damn
vii
the
allied
arts
i
of
all
forms
of
the
uplift
perhaps
the
most
futile
is
that
which
addresses
itself
to
educating
the
proletariat
in
music
the
theory
behind
it
is
that
a
taste
for
music
is
an
elevating
passion
and
that
if
the
great
masses
of
the
plain
people
could
be
inoculated
with
it
they
would
cease
to
herd
into
the
theaters
or
to
listen
to
socialists
or
to
beat
their
wives
and
children
the
defect
in
this
theory
lies
in
the
fact
that
such
a
taste
granting
it
to
be
elevating
simply
can
not
be
implanted
either
it
is
born
in
a
man
or
it
is
not
born
in
him
if
it
is
then
he
will
get
gratification
for
it
at
whatever
cost
he
will
hear
music
if
hell
freezes
over
but
if
it
is
then
no
amount
of
education
will
ever
change
him
he
will
remain
stone
deaf
until
the
last
sad
scene
on
the
gallows
no
child
who
has
this
congenital
taste
ever
has
to
be
urged
or
tempted
or
taught
to
love
music
it
takes
to
tone
inevitably
and
irresistibly
nothing
can
restrain
it
what
is
more
it
always
tries
to
music
for
the
delight
in
sounds
is
invariably
accompanied
by
a
great
desire
to
make
them
i
have
never
encountered
an
exception
to
this
rule
all
genuine
try
to
make
music
they
may
do
it
badly
and
even
absurdly
but
nevertheless
they
do
it
any
man
who
pretends
to
a
delight
in
the
and
yet
has
never
learned
the
scale
of
g
major
any
and
every
such
man
is
a
fraud
the
of
the
world
are
crowded
with
such
liars
you
will
even
find
hundreds
of
them
in
the
though
here
the
suffering
they
have
to
undergo
to
keep
up
their
pretense
is
almost
too
much
for
them
to
bear
many
of
them
true
enough
deceive
themselves
they
are
honest
in
the
sense
that
they
credit
their
own
buncombe
but
it
is
buncombe
none
the
less
music
of
course
has
room
for
philanthropy
the
cost
of
giving
an
orchestral
concert
is
so
great
that
ordinary
could
not
often
pay
for
it
here
the
way
is
open
for
rich
backers
most
of
whom
have
no
more
ear
for
music
than
so
many
chinamen
nearly
all
the
opera
of
the
world
is
so
supported
a
few
rich
cads
pay
the
bills
their
wives
posture
obscenely
in
the
boxes
and
the
genuine
upstairs
and
down
enjoy
the
more
or
less
harmonious
flow
of
sound
but
this
business
does
it
merely
gives
pleasure
to
who
already
exist
in
years
i
am
sure
the
metropolitan
opera
company
has
converted
a
single
on
the
contrary
it
has
probably
disgusted
and
alienated
many
thousands
of
persons
with
no
more
than
the
most
nebulous
taste
for
music
so
nebulous
that
one
or
two
evenings
of
tremendous
gargling
by
fat
tenors
was
enough
to
kill
it
altogether
in
the
united
states
the
number
of
genuine
is
probably
very
low
there
are
whole
states
alabama
arkansas
and
idaho
in
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
muster
a
hundred
in
new
york
i
venture
not
more
than
one
person
in
every
thousand
of
the
population
deserves
to
be
counted
the
rest
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
they
can
not
only
sit
through
the
infernal
din
made
by
the
current
they
actually
like
it
this
is
precisely
as
if
they
preferred
the
works
of
the
duchess
to
those
of
thomas
hardy
or
the
paintings
of
the
men
who
make
covers
for
popular
novels
to
those
of
el
greco
such
persons
inhabit
the
sewers
of
the
bozart
no
conceivable
education
could
rid
them
of
their
native
ignobility
of
soul
they
are
born
unspeakable
and
incurable
opera
opera
to
a
person
genuinely
fond
of
aural
beauty
must
inevitably
appear
tawdry
and
obnoxious
if
only
because
it
presents
aural
beauty
in
a
frame
of
purely
visual
gaudiness
with
overtones
of
the
grossest
sexual
provocation
the
most
successful
opera
singers
of
the
female
sex
at
least
in
america
are
not
those
whom
the
majority
of
auditors
admire
most
as
singers
but
those
whom
the
majority
of
male
spectators
desire
most
as
mistresses
opera
is
chiefly
supported
in
all
countries
by
the
same
sort
of
wealthy
sensualists
who
also
support
musical
comedy
one
finds
in
the
directors
room
the
traditional
stock
company
of
the
alley
such
vermin
of
course
pose
in
the
newspapers
as
devout
and
almost
fanatical
partisans
of
art
they
exhibit
themselves
at
every
performance
one
hears
of
their
grand
doings
through
their
press
agents
almost
every
day
but
one
has
merely
to
observe
the
sort
of
opera
they
think
is
good
to
get
the
measure
of
their
actual
artistic
discrimination
the
genuine
may
accept
the
carnal
husk
of
opera
to
get
at
the
kernel
of
actual
music
within
but
that
is
no
sign
that
he
approves
the
carnal
husk
or
enjoys
gnawing
through
it
most
musicians
indeed
prefer
to
hear
operatic
music
outside
the
opera
house
that
is
why
one
so
often
hears
such
things
as
the
ride
of
the
valkyrie
in
the
concert
hall
the
ride
of
the
valkyrie
has
a
certain
intrinsic
value
as
pure
music
played
by
a
competent
orchestra
it
may
give
civilized
pleasure
but
as
it
is
commonly
performed
in
an
opera
house
with
a
posse
of
flat
throwing
themselves
about
the
stage
it
can
only
produce
the
effect
of
a
dose
of
ipecacuanha
the
sort
of
person
who
actually
delights
in
such
spectacles
is
the
sort
of
person
who
delights
in
plush
furniture
such
are
in
a
majority
in
every
opera
house
west
of
the
rhine
they
go
to
the
opera
not
to
hear
music
not
even
to
hear
bad
music
but
merely
to
see
a
more
or
less
obscene
circus
a
few
perhaps
have
a
further
purpose
they
desire
to
assist
in
that
circus
to
show
themselves
in
the
capacity
of
fashionables
to
enchant
the
yokelry
with
their
splendor
but
the
majority
must
be
content
with
the
more
lowly
aim
what
they
get
for
the
outrageous
prices
they
pay
for
seats
is
a
chance
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
glittering
members
of
the
superior
and
to
abase
their
groveling
souls
before
magnificoes
on
their
own
side
of
the
footlights
they
esteem
a
performance
not
in
proportion
as
true
music
is
on
tap
but
in
proportion
as
the
display
of
notorious
characters
on
the
stage
is
copious
and
the
exhibition
of
wealth
in
the
boxes
is
lavish
a
soprano
who
can
gargle
her
way
up
to
g
sharp
in
alto
is
more
to
such
simple
souls
than
a
whole
drove
of
johann
sebastian
bachs
her
one
real
rival
in
the
entire
domain
of
art
is
the
contralto
who
has
a
pension
from
a
grand
duke
and
is
reported
to
be
by
several
profiteers
heaven
visualizes
itself
as
an
opera
house
with
carusos
each
with
press
agents
on
the
continent
where
frankness
is
unashamed
the
opera
audience
often
reveals
its
passion
for
tone
very
naively
that
is
to
say
it
arises
on
its
hind
legs
turns
its
back
upon
the
stage
and
gapes
at
the
boxes
in
charming
innocence
that
such
ignobles
applaud
is
usually
quite
as
shoddy
as
they
are
themselves
to
write
a
successful
opera
a
knowledge
of
harmony
and
counterpoint
is
not
enough
one
must
also
be
a
sort
of
barnum
all
the
musicians
who
have
triumphed
in
the
opera
house
have
been
skillful
mountebanks
as
well
i
need
cite
only
richard
wagner
and
richard
strauss
the
business
indeed
has
almost
nothing
to
do
with
music
all
the
actual
music
one
finds
in
many
a
popular
opera
for
example
thaïs
mounts
up
to
less
than
one
may
find
in
a
pair
of
waltzes
it
is
not
this
mild
flavor
of
tone
that
fetches
the
crowd
it
is
the
tinpot
show
that
goes
with
it
an
opera
may
have
plenty
of
good
music
in
it
and
fail
but
if
it
has
a
good
enough
show
it
will
succeed
such
a
composer
as
wagner
of
course
could
not
write
even
an
opera
without
getting
some
music
into
it
in
nearly
all
of
his
works
even
including
parsifal
there
are
magnificent
passages
and
some
of
them
are
very
long
here
his
natural
genius
overcame
him
and
he
forgot
temporarily
what
he
was
about
but
these
magnificent
passages
pass
unnoticed
by
the
average
opera
audience
what
it
esteems
in
his
music
dramas
is
precisely
what
is
cheapest
and
most
mountebankish
for
example
the
more
lascivious
parts
of
tristan
und
isolde
the
sound
music
it
dismisses
as
tedious
the
wagner
it
venerates
is
not
the
musician
but
the
showman
that
he
had
a
king
for
a
backer
and
was
seduced
by
liszt
daughter
these
facts
and
not
the
fact
of
his
stupendous
talent
are
the
foundation
stones
of
his
fame
in
the
opera
house
greater
men
lacking
his
touch
of
the
quack
have
failed
where
he
succeeded
beethoven
schubert
schumann
brahms
bach
haydn
haendel
not
one
of
them
produced
a
genuinely
successful
opera
most
of
them
did
even
try
imagine
brahms
writing
for
the
diamond
horseshoe
or
bach
or
haydn
beethoven
attempted
it
but
made
a
mess
of
it
fidelio
survives
chiefly
as
a
set
of
concert
overtures
schubert
wrote
more
actual
music
every
morning
between
and
lunch
time
than
the
average
opera
composer
produces
in
years
and
yet
he
always
came
a
cropper
in
the
opera
house
music

viewing
the
current
musical
scene
carl
van

finds
it
full
of
sadness
even

bores

he
heard
nothing
interesting
from
that
quarter
for
a
long
while
before
the
final
scene

for

he
finds
it

go
to

back
to
the
where
then
is
the

of
to
come
from
according
to

from
russia
it
is
the
steppes
that
will
produce

more
specifically
igor

author
of
the

and
of
various
revolutionary
ballets
in
the
scores
of
strawinsky
says
van
vechten
music
takes
a
vast
leap
forward
here
at
last
we
are
definitely
set
free
from
melody
and
harmony
the
thing
becomes
an
ineffable
complex
of
rhythms
all
rhythms
are
beaten
into
the
ears
new
of
the
future
i
have
not
heard
all
of
the
powerful
shiverings
and
tremblings
of
strawinsky
but
i
presume
to
doubt
it
none
the
less
the
ancient
greeks
says
van
vechten
accorded
rhythm
a
higher
place
than
either
melody
or
harmony
well
what
of
it
so
did
the
ancient
goths
and
huns
so
do
the
modern
zulus
and
new
yorkers
the
simple
truth
is
that
the
accentuation
of
mere
rhythm
is
a
proof
not
of
progress
in
music
but
of
a
reversion
to
barbarism
rhythm
is
the
earliest
the
underlying
element
the
african
savage
beating
his
is
content
to
go
no
further
the
american
composer
of
fox
trots
is
with
him
but
music
had
scarcely
any
existence
as
an
until
melody
came
to
rhythm
aid
and
its
fruits
were
little
save
dullness
until
harmony
began
to
support
melody
to
argue
that
mere
rhythm
unsupported
by
anything
save
may
now
take
their
place
is
to
argue
something
so
absurd
that
its
mere
statement
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
it
the
rise
of
harmony
true
enough
laid
open
a
dangerous
field
its
exploration
attracted
meticulous
minds
it
was
rigidly
mapped
in
hard
geometrical
forms
in
the
end
it
became
almost
unnavigable
to
the
man
of
ideas
but
no
melodramatic
rejection
of
all
harmony
is
needed
to
work
a
reform
the
business
indeed
is
already
gloriously
under
way
the
dullest
conservatory
pupil
has
learned
how
to
pull
the
noses
of
the
schoolmasters
no
one
cares
a
hoot
any
more
about
the
ancient
laws
of
preparation
and
resolution
the
rules
grow
so
loose
indeed
that
i
may
soon
be
tempted
to
write
a
myself
but
out
of
this
chaos
new
laws
will
inevitably
arise
and
though
they
will
not
be
as
rigid
as
the
old
ones
they
will
still
be
coherent
and
logical
and
intelligible
already
in
fact
gentlemen
of
professorial
mind
are
mapping
them
out
one
needs
but
a
glance
at
such
a
book
as
rené
lenormand
to
see
that
there
is
a
certain
order
hidden
in
even
the
wildest
vagaries
of
the
moment
and
when
the
boiling
in
the
pot
dies
down
the
truly
great
musicians
will
be
found
to
be
not
those
who
have
been
most
daring
but
those
who
have
been
most
discreet
and
intelligent
those
who
have
most
skillfully
engrafted
what
is
good
in
the
new
upon
what
was
sound
in
the
old
such
a
discreet
fellow
is
richard
strauss
his
music
is
modern
enough
but
not
too
much
one
is
thrilled
by
its
experiments
and
novelties
but
at
the
same
time
one
can
enjoy
the
thing
as
music
haydn
mozart
beethoven
and
wagner
belonged
to
the
same
lodge
they
were
by
no
means
the
wildest
revolutionaries
of
their
days
but
they
were
the
best
musicians
they
did
try
to
improve
music
by
purging
it
of
any
of
the
elements
that
made
it
music
they
tried
and
with
success
to
give
each
element
a
new
force
and
a
new
significance
berlioz
i
dare
say
knew
more
about
the
orchestra
than
wagner
he
surely
went
further
than
wagner
in
reaching
out
for
new
orchestral
effects
but
nothing
he
ever
wrote
has
a
fourth
of
the
stability
and
value
of
die
meistersinger
he
was
so
intrigued
by
his
that
he
forgot
his
music
di
those
puritans
who
snort
against
the
current
dances
are
quite
right
when
they
argue
that
the
tango
and
the
shimmie
are
violently
aphrodisiacal
but
what
they
overlook
is
the
fact
that
the
abolition
of
such
provocative
wriggles
would
probably
revive
something
worse
to
wit
the
viennese
waltz
the
waltz
never
quite
goes
out
of
fashion
it
is
always
just
around
the
corner
every
now
and
then
it
comes
back
with
a
bang
and
to
the
sore
harassment
and
corruption
i
suspect
of
chemical
purity
the
ideal
of
all
the
shimmie
and
the
tango
are
too
gross
to
be
very
dangerous
to
civilized
human
beings
they
suggest
drinking
beer
out
of
buckets
the
most
elemental
good
taste
is
proof
enough
against
them
but
the
waltz
ah
the
waltz
indeed
it
is
sneaking
insidious
disarming
lovely
it
does
its
work
not
like
a
or
an
explosion
in
a
munitions
plant
but
like
the
rustle
of
the
trees
the
murmur
of
the
illimitable
sea
the
sweet
gurgle
of
a
pretty
girl
the
fetches
only
vulgarians
barbarians
idiots
pigs
but
there
is
a
mystical
something
in
weiner
blut
or
künstler
leben
that
fetches
even
philosophers
the
waltz
in
fact
is
magnificently
improper
the
art
of
tone
turned
bawdy
i
venture
to
say
that
the
compositions
of
one
man
alone
johann
strauss
ii
have
lured
more
fair
young
creatures
to
lamentable
complaisance
than
all
the
hyperdermic
syringes
of
all
the
white
slave
scouts
since
the
fall
of
the
western
empire
there
is
something
about
a
waltz
that
is
simply
irresistible
try
it
on
the
fattest
and
sedatest
or
even
upon
the
thinnest
and
most
acidulous
of
women
and
she
will
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
for
a
stealthy
kiss
behind
the
door
nay
she
will
forthwith
impart
the
embarrassing
news
that
her
husband
misunderstands
her
and
drinks
too
much
and
can
not
appreciate
maeterlinck
and
is
going
to
cleveland
on
business
i
often
wonder
that
the
comstocks
have
not
undertaken
a
crusade
against
the
waltz
if
they
suppress
the
and
jurgen
then
why
do
they
overlook
rosen
aus
dem
süden
if
they
are
so
hot
against
madame
bovary
and
the
decameron
then
why
the
immunity
of
wein
weib
und
gesang
i
throw
out
the
suggestion
and
pass
on
nearly
all
the
great
waltzes
of
the
world
incidently
were
written
by
germans
or
austrians
a
would
thus
enlist
the
american
legion
and
the
daughters
of
the
revolution
moreover
there
is
the
public
health
service
it
is
already
engaged
upon
a
campaign
to
enforce
virginity
in
both
sexes
by
statute
and
artillery
imagine
such
an
enterprise
with
every
band
free
to
play
wiener
puritan
as
the
saddest
thing
that
i
have
ever
heard
in
the
concert
hall
is
herbert
hadley
overture
in
bohemia
the
title
is
a
magnificent
piece
of
profound
if
unconscious
irony
one
looks
at
least
for
a
leg
flung
in
the
air
a
girl
kissed
a
cork
popped
a
flash
of
what
one
encounters
is
a
meeting
of
the
lake
mohonk
conference
such
prosy
correctness
and
hollowness
in
music
is
almost
inconceivable
it
is
as
if
the
most
voluptuous
of
the
arts
were
suddenly
converted
into
an
abstract
and
austere
science
like
comparative
grammar
or
who
who
in
america
says
that
hadley
was
born
in
somerville
and
studied
violin
and
other
branches
in
vienna
a
prodigy
thus
unfolds
itself
here
is
a
man
who
lived
in
vienna
and
yet
never
heard
a
strauss
waltz
this
indeed
is
an
even
greater
feat
than
being
born
an
artist
in
somerville
human
probably
the
best
portrait
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
america
is
one
of
theodore
dreiser
by
bror
nordfeldt
who
this
bror
nordfeldt
may
be
i
have
the
slightest
notion
a
scandinavian
perhaps
maybe
i
have
got
his
name
wrong
i
ca
find
any
nordfeldt
in
who
who
in
america
but
whatever
his
name
he
has
painted
dreiser
in
a
capital
manner
the
portrait
not
only
shows
the
outward
shell
of
the
man
it
also
conveys
something
of
his
inner
spirit
his
wonder
at
the
mystery
of
existence
his
constant
effort
to
argue
himself
out
of
a
despairing
pessimism
his
genuine
amazement
before
life
as
a
spectacle
the
thing
is
worth
a
hundred
sargents
with
their
slick
lying
their
childish
facility
their
general
hollowness
and
tackiness
sargent
should
have
been
a
designer
of
tops
the
notion
that
he
is
a
great
artist
is
one
of
the
astounding
delusions
of
what
keeps
it
going
is
the
patent
fact
that
he
is
a
very
dexterous
craftsman
one
who
understands
thoroughly
how
to
paint
just
as
a
good
plumber
knows
how
to
plumb
but
of
genuine
æsthetic
feeling
the
man
is
almost
as
destitute
as
the
plumber
his
portrait
of
the
four
johns
hopkins
professors
is
probably
the
worst
botch
ever
palmed
off
on
a
helpless
committee
of
intellectual
hay
and
feed
dealers
but
nordfeldt
in
his
view
of
dreiser
somehow
gets
the
right
effect
it
is
rough
painting
but
real
painting
there
is
a
vase
in
the
foreground
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
apparently
painted
with
a
but
dreiser
himself
is
genuine
more
he
is
made
interesting
one
sees
at
once
that
he
is
no
common
man
the
artist
himself
seems
to
hold
the
portrait
in
low
esteem
having
finished
it
he
reversed
the
canvas
and
used
the
back
for
painting
a
vapid
snow
scenes
a
thing
almost
bad
enough
to
go
into
a
fifth
avenue
then
he
abandoned
both
pictures
i
discovered
the
portrait
by
accidentally
knocking
the
snow
scene
off
a
wall
it
has
never
been
framed
drieser
himself
has
probably
forgotten
it
no
i
do
predict
that
it
will
be
sold
to
some
pittsburgh
nail
manufacturer
in
for
if
it
lasts
two
or
three
more
years
unframed
and
disesteemed
it
will
be
running
in
luck
when
dreiser
is
hanged
i
suppose
will
make
a
search
for
it
but
by
that
time
it
will
have
died
as
a
cerebral
of
all
actors
the
most
offensive
to
the
higher
cerebral
centers
is
the
one
who
pretends
to
intellectuality
his
alleged
intelligence
of
course
is
always
purely
imaginary
no
man
of
genuinely
superior
intelligence
has
ever
been
an
actor
even
supposing
a
young
man
of
appreciable
mental
powers
to
be
lured
upon
the
stage
as
philosophers
are
occasionally
lured
into
bordellos
his
mind
would
be
inevitably
and
almost
immediately
destroyed
by
the
gaudy
nonsense
issuing
from
his
mouth
every
night
that
nonsense
enters
into
the
very
fiber
of
the
actor
he
becomes
a
grotesque
boiling
down
of
all
the
preposterous
characters
that
he
has
ever
impersonated
their
characteristics
are
seen
in
his
manner
in
his
reactions
to
stimuli
in
his
point
of
view
he
becomes
a
walking
artificiality
a
strutting
dummy
a
thematic
catalogue
of
imbecilities
there
are
of
course
plays
that
are
not
wholly
nonsense
and
now
and
then
one
encounters
an
actor
who
aspires
to
appear
in
them
this
aspiration
almost
always
overtakes
the
that
is
to
say
the
actor
who
has
got
rich
and
is
thus
ambitious
to
appear
as
a
gentleman
such
aspirants
commonly
tackle
shakespeare
and
if
not
shakespeare
then
shaw
or
hauptmann
or
rostand
or
some
other
apparently
intellectual
dramatist
but
this
is
seldom
more
than
a
passing
madness
the
may
do
that
sort
of
thing
once
in
a
while
but
in
the
main
he
sticks
to
his
garbage
consider
for
example
the
late
henry
irving
he
posed
as
an
intellectual
and
was
forever
gabbling
about
his
high
services
to
the
stage
and
yet
he
appeared
constantly
in
such
puerile
things
as
the
bells
beside
which
the
average
newspaper
editorial
or
college
yell
was
literature
so
with
the
late
mansfield
his
pretension
deftly
circulated
by
was
that
he
was
a
man
of
brilliant
and
polished
mind
nevertheless
he
spent
of
his
life
in
the
theater
playing
such
abominable
drival
as
a
parisian
romance
and
jekyll
and
mr
hyde
it
is
commonly
urged
in
defense
of
certain
actors
that
they
are
forced
to
appear
in
that
sort
of
stuff
by
the
public
demand
for
it
that
appearing
in
it
painfully
violates
their
secret
pruderies
this
defense
is
unsound
and
dishonest
an
actor
never
disdains
anything
that
gets
him
applause
and
money
he
is
almost
completely
devoid
of
that
æsthetic
conscience
which
is
the
chief
mark
of
the
genuine
artist
if
there
were
a
large
public
willing
to
pay
handsomely
to
hear
him
recite
limericks
or
to
blow
a
cornet
or
to
strip
off
his
underwear
and
dance
a
polonaise
stark
naked
he
would
do
it
without
hesitation
and
then
convince
himself
that
such
buffooning
constituted
a
difficult
and
elevated
art
fully
comparable
to
wagner
or
dante
in
brief
the
one
essential
in
his
sight
is
the
chance
to
shine
the
fat
part
the
applause
who
ever
heard
of
an
actor
declining
a
fat
part
on
the
ground
that
it
invaded
his
intellectual
integrity
the
thing
is
simply
unimaginable
viii
the
cult
of
hope
of
all
the
sentimental
errors
which
reign
and
rage
in
this
incomparable
republic
the
worst
i
often
suspect
is
that
which
confuses
the
function
of
criticism
whether
æsthetic
political
or
social
with
the
function
of
reform
almost
invariably
it
takes
the
form
of
a
protest
the
fellow
condems
without
offering
anything
better
why
tear
down
without
building
up
so
coo
and
snivel
the
sweet
ones
so
wags
the
national
tongue
the
messianic
delusion
becomes
a
sort
of
universal
murrain
it
is
impossible
to
get
an
audience
for
an
idea
that
is
not
constructive
that
is
not
glib
and
uplifting
and
full
of
hope
and
hence
capable
of
tickling
the
emotions
by
leaping
the
intermediate
barrier
of
the
intelligence
in
this
protest
and
demand
of
course
there
is
nothing
but
a
hollow
sound
of
words
the
empty
babbling
of
men
who
constantly
mistake
their
mere
feelings
for
thoughts
the
truth
is
that
criticism
if
it
were
thus
confined
to
the
proposing
of
alternative
schemes
would
quickly
cease
to
have
any
force
or
utility
at
all
for
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
instances
no
alternative
scheme
of
any
intelligibility
is
imaginable
and
the
whole
object
of
the
critical
process
is
to
demonstrate
it
the
poet
if
the
victim
is
a
poet
is
simply
one
as
bare
of
gifts
as
a
herring
is
of
fur
no
conceivable
suggestion
will
ever
make
him
write
actual
poetry
the
cancer
cure
if
one
turns
to
popular
swindles
is
wholly
and
absolutely
without
merit
and
the
fact
that
medicine
offers
us
no
better
cure
does
not
dilute
its
bogusness
in
the
slightest
and
the
plan
of
reform
in
politics
sociology
or
what
not
is
simply
beyond
the
pale
of
reason
no
change
in
it
or
improvement
of
it
will
ever
make
it
achieve
the
downright
impossible
here
precisely
is
what
is
the
matter
with
most
of
the
notions
that
go
floating
about
the
country
particularly
in
the
field
of
governmental
reform
the
trouble
with
them
is
not
only
that
they
wo
and
work
the
trouble
with
them
more
importantly
is
that
the
thing
they
propose
to
accomplish
is
intrinsically
or
at
all
events
most
probably
beyond
accomplishment
that
is
to
say
the
problem
they
are
ostensibly
designed
to
solve
is
a
problem
that
is
insoluble
to
tackle
them
with
a
proof
of
that
insolubility
or
even
with
a
colorable
argument
of
it
is
sound
criticism
to
tackle
them
with
another
solution
that
is
quite
as
bad
or
even
worse
is
to
pick
the
pocket
of
one
knocked
down
by
an
automobile
unluckily
it
is
difficult
for
a
certain
type
of
mind
to
grasp
the
concept
of
insolubility
thousands
of
poor
dolts
keep
on
trying
to
square
the
circle
other
thousands
keep
pegging
away
at
perpetual
motion
the
number
of
persons
so
afflicted
is
far
greater
than
the
records
of
the
patent
office
show
for
beyond
the
circle
of
frankly
insane
enterprise
there
lie
circles
of
more
and
more
plausible
enterprise
and
finally
we
come
to
a
circle
which
embraces
the
great
majority
of
human
beings
these
are
the
optimists
and
chronic
hopers
of
the
world
the
believers
in
men
ideas
and
things
these
are
the
advocates
of
leagues
of
nations
wars
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
political
mountebanks
campaigns
laws
raids
men
and
religion
forward
movements
eugenics
sex
hygiene
education
newspapers
it
is
the
settled
habit
of
such
credulous
folk
to
give
ear
to
whatever
is
comforting
it
is
their
settled
faith
that
whatever
is
desirable
will
come
to
pass
a
caressing
confidence
but
one
unfortunately
that
is
not
borne
out
by
human
experience
the
fact
is
that
some
of
the
things
that
men
and
women
have
desired
most
ardently
for
thousands
of
years
are
not
nearer
realization
than
they
were
in
the
time
of
rameses
and
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
for
believing
that
they
will
lose
their
coyness
on
any
near
plans
for
hurrying
them
on
have
been
tried
since
the
beginning
plans
for
forcing
them
overnight
are
in
copious
and
antagonistic
operation
and
yet
they
continue
to
hold
off
and
elude
us
and
the
chances
are
that
they
will
keep
on
holding
off
and
eluding
us
until
the
angels
get
tired
of
the
show
and
the
whole
earth
is
set
off
like
a
gigantic
bomb
or
drowned
like
a
sick
cat
between
two
buckets
but
let
us
avoid
the
grand
and
chronic
dreams
of
the
race
and
get
down
to
some
of
the
concrete
problems
of
life
under
the
christian
enlightenment
let
us
take
a
look
say
at
the
drink
problem
a
small
of
the
larger
problem
of
saving
men
from
their
inherent
and
incurable
hoggishness
what
is
the
salient
feature
of
the
discussion
of
the
drink
problem
as
one
observes
it
going
on
eternally
in
these
states
the
salient
feature
of
it
is
that
very
few
honest
and
intelligent
men
ever
take
a
hand
in
the
business
that
the
best
men
of
the
nation
distinguished
for
their
sound
sense
in
other
fields
seldom
show
any
interest
in
it
on
the
one
hand
it
is
labored
by
a
horde
of
obvious
jackasses
each
confident
that
he
can
dispose
of
it
overnight
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
sophisticated
and
obscured
by
a
crowd
of
oblique
fellows
hired
by
interested
parties
whose
secret
desire
is
that
it
be
kept
unsolved
to
one
side
the
professional
gladiators
of
prohibition
to
the
other
side
the
agents
of
the
brewers
and
distillers
but
why
do
all
neutral
and
men
avoid
it
why
does
one
hear
so
little
about
it
from
those
who
have
no
personal
stake
in
it
and
can
thus
view
it
fairly
and
accurately
is
it
because
they
are
afraid
is
it
because
they
are
not
intrigued
by
it
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
just
to
accuse
them
in
either
way
the
real
reason
why
they
steer
clear
of
the
gabble
is
simpler
and
more
creditable
it
is
this
that
none
of
them
that
no
genuinely
thoughtful
and
prudent
man
can
imagine
any
solution
which
meets
the
tests
of
his
own
criticism
that
no
genuinely
intelligent
man
believes
the
thing
is
soluble
at
all
here
of
course
i
generalize
a
bit
heavily
honest
and
intelligent
men
though
surely
not
many
of
them
occasionally
come
forward
with
suggestions
in
the
midst
of
so
much
debate
it
is
inevitable
that
even
a
man
of
critical
mind
should
sometimes
lean
to
one
side
or
the
other
that
some
salient
imbecility
should
make
him
react
toward
its
rough
opposite
but
the
fact
still
remains
that
not
a
single
complete
and
comprehensive
scheme
has
ever
come
from
such
a
man
that
no
such
man
has
ever
said
in
so
many
words
that
he
thought
the
problem
could
be
solved
simply
and
effectively
all
such
schemes
come
from
idiots
or
from
sharpers
disguised
as
idiots
to
win
the
public
confidence
the
whole
discussion
is
based
upon
assumptions
that
even
the
most
casual
reflection
must
reject
as
empty
balderdash
and
as
with
the
drink
problem
so
with
most
of
the
other
great
questions
that
harass
and
dismay
the
helpless
human
race
turn
for
example
to
the
sex
problem
there
is
no
ecclesiastic
bawling
in
his
temple
on
a
suburban
lot
who
know
precisely
how
it
ought
to
be
dealt
with
there
is
no
fantoddish
old
suffragette
sworn
to
get
her
revenge
on
man
who
has
a
sovereign
remedy
for
it
there
is
not
a
shyster
of
a
district
attorney
ambitious
for
higher
office
who
does
offer
to
dispose
of
it
in
a
few
weeks
given
only
enough
help
from
the
city
editors
and
yet
by
the
same
token
there
is
not
a
man
who
has
honestly
studied
it
and
pondered
it
bringing
sound
information
to
the
business
and
understanding
of
its
inner
difficulties
and
a
clean
and
analytical
mind
who
does
believe
and
has
stated
publicly
that
it
is
intrinsically
and
eternally
insoluble
i
ca
think
of
an
exception
nor
does
a
fresh
glance
through
the
literature
suggest
one
the
latest
expert
to
tell
the
disconcerting
truth
is
maurice
parmelee
the
criminologist
his
book
personality
and
conduct
is
largely
devoted
to
demonstrating
that
the
popular
solutions
for
all
the
support
they
get
from
vice
crusaders
complaisant
legislators
and
sensational
newspapers
are
unanimously
imbecile
and
pernicious
that
their
only
effect
in
practice
is
to
make
what
was
bad
a
good
deal
worse
his
remedy
is
what
an
alternative
solution
not
at
all
his
remedy
in
brief
is
to
abandon
all
attempts
at
a
solution
to
let
the
whole
thing
go
to
cork
up
all
the
reformers
and
try
to
forget
it
and
in
this
proposal
he
merely
echoes
havelock
ellis
undoubtedly
the
most
diligent
and
scientific
student
of
the
sex
problem
that
the
world
has
yet
seen
in
fact
the
one
man
who
above
all
others
has
made
a
decorous
and
intelligent
examination
of
it
possible
remedy
is
simply
a
denial
of
all
remedies
he
admits
that
the
disease
is
bad
but
he
shows
that
the
medicine
is
infinitely
worse
and
so
he
proposes
going
back
to
the
plain
disease
and
advocates
bearing
it
with
philosophy
as
we
bear
colds
in
the
head
marriage
the
noises
of
the
city
bad
cooking
and
the
certainty
of
death
man
is
inherently
vile
but
he
is
never
so
vile
as
when
he
is
trying
to
disguise
and
deny
his
vileness
no
prostitute
was
ever
so
costly
to
a
community
as
a
prowling
and
obscene
vice
crusader
or
as
the
dubious
legislator
or
prosecuting
officer
who
jumps
as
he
pipes
ellis
in
all
this
falls
under
the
excommunication
of
the
sentimentalists
he
demolishes
one
scheme
without
offering
an
alternative
scheme
he
tears
down
without
making
any
effort
to
build
up
this
explains
no
doubt
his
general
unpopularity
into
mouths
agape
for
peruna
he
projects
only
paralyzing
streams
of
and
it
explains
too
the
curious
fact
that
his
books
the
most
competent
and
illuminating
upon
the
subject
that
they
discuss
are
under
the
ban
of
the
comstocks
in
both
england
and
america
whereas
the
hollow
treatises
of
ignorant
clerics
and
smutty
old
maids
are
merchanted
with
impunity
and
even
commended
from
the
sacred
desk
the
trouble
with
ellis
is
that
he
tells
the
truth
which
is
the
unsafest
of
all
things
to
tell
his
crime
is
that
he
is
a
man
who
prefers
facts
to
illusions
and
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
such
men
are
never
popular
the
public
taste
is
for
merchandise
of
a
precisely
opposite
character
the
way
to
please
is
to
proclaim
in
a
confident
manner
not
what
is
true
but
what
is
merely
comforting
this
is
what
is
called
building
up
this
is
constructive
criticism
ix
the
dry
millennium
holy
the
fact
that
the
enforcement
of
prohibition
entails
a
host
of
oppressions
and
injustices
that
it
puts
a
premium
upon
the
lowest
sort
of
spying
affords
an
easy
livelihood
to
hordes
of
professional
scoundrels
subjects
thousands
of
decent
men
to
the
worst
sort
of
blackmail
violates
the
theoretical
sanctity
of
domicile
and
makes
for
bitter
and
relentless
enmities
this
fact
is
now
adduced
by
its
foes
as
an
argument
for
the
abandonment
of
the
whole
disgusting
crusade
by
it
they
expect
to
convert
even
a
large
minority
of
the
drys
apparently
on
the
theory
that
the
latter
got
converted
emotionally
and
hastily
and
that
an
appeal
to
their
sense
of
justice
and
will
debamboozle
them
no
hope
could
be
more
vain
what
all
the
current
optimists
overlook
is
that
the
illogical
and
indefensible
persecutions
certain
to
occur
in
increasing
number
under
the
prohibition
amendment
constitute
the
chief
cause
of
its
popularity
among
the
sort
of
men
who
are
in
favor
of
it
the
typical
prohibitionist
in
other
words
is
a
man
full
of
religious
excitement
with
the
usual
sadistic
overtones
he
delights
in
persecution
for
its
own
sake
he
likes
to
see
the
other
fellow
jump
and
to
hear
him
yell
this
thirst
is
horribly
visible
in
all
the
salient
mad
mullahs
of
the
land
that
is
in
all
the
genuine
leaders
of
american
culture
such
skillful
as
the
rev
billy
sunday
know
what
that
culture
is
they
know
what
the
crowd
wants
thus
they
convert
the
preaching
of
the
alleged
word
of
god
into
a
pursuit
of
definite
sinners
prostitutes
believers
in
the
darwinian
hypothesis
german
exegetes
adulterers
users
of
profanity
it
is
the
chase
that
heats
up
the
great
mob
of
methodists
not
the
word
and
the
fact
that
the
chase
is
unjust
only
tickles
them
the
more
for
to
do
injustice
with
impunity
is
a
sign
of
power
and
power
is
the
thing
that
the
inferior
man
always
craves
most
violently
every
time
the
papers
print
another
account
of
a
prohibionist
agent
murdering
a
man
who
resists
him
or
searching
some
woman
underwear
or
raiding
a
vanderbilt
yacht
or
blackmailing
a
legislature
or
committing
some
other
such
inordinate
and
act
they
simply
make
a
thousand
more
votes
for
prohibition
it
is
precisely
that
sort
of
entertainment
that
makes
prohibition
popular
with
the
boobery
it
is
precisely
because
it
is
unjust
imbecile
arbitrary
and
tyrannical
that
they
are
so
hot
for
it
the
incidental
violation
of
even
the
inferior
mans
liberty
is
not
sufficient
to
empty
him
of
delight
in
the
chase
the
victims
reported
in
the
newspapers
are
commonly
his
superiors
he
thus
gets
the
immemorial
democratic
satisfaction
out
of
their
discomfiture
besides
he
has
no
great
rage
for
liberty
himself
he
is
always
willing
to
surrender
it
at
demand
the
most
popular
man
under
a
democracy
is
not
the
most
democratic
man
but
the
most
despotic
man
the
common
folk
delight
in
the
exactions
of
such
a
man
they
like
him
to
boss
them
their
natural
gait
is
the
it
was
predicted
by
romantics
that
the
arrival
of
prohibition
would
see
the
american
workingman
in
revolt
against
its
tyranny
with
mills
idle
and
industry
paralyzed
certain
boozy
labor
leaders
even
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
a
general
strike
no
such
strike
of
course
materialized
not
a
single
american
workingman
uttered
a
sound
the
only
protests
heard
of
came
from
a
few
barbarous
foreigners
and
these
malcontents
were
quickly
beaten
into
submission
by
the
in
a
week
or
two
all
the
reserve
stocks
of
beer
were
exhausted
and
every
jug
of
authentic
hard
liquor
was
emptied
since
then
save
for
the
ghastly
messes
that
he
has
brewed
behind
locked
doors
the
american
workingman
has
been
dry
worse
he
has
also
been
silent
not
a
sound
has
come
out
of
him
but
his
liver
is
full
of
bile
he
nourishes
an
intolerable
grievance
he
will
get
his
revenge
soon
or
late
at
the
polls
all
moonshine
he
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
will
actually
do
what
he
always
does
that
is
he
will
make
a
virtue
of
his
necessity
and
straightway
begin
believing
that
he
prohibition
that
it
is
doing
him
a
lot
of
good
that
he
would
be
without
it
if
he
could
this
is
the
habitual
process
of
thought
of
inferior
men
at
all
times
and
everywhere
this
is
the
sturdy
common
sense
of
the
plain
people
lure
of
one
of
the
ultimate
of
prohibition
and
the
allied
puritanical
barbarities
will
probably
be
an
appreciable
slackening
in
the
present
movement
of
yokels
toward
the
large
cities
the
thing
that
attracted
the
peasant
youth
to
our
gaudy
sodoms
and
ninevehs
in
the
past
was
not
as
sociologists
have
always
assumed
the
prospect
of
less
work
and
more
money
the
country
boy
in
point
of
fact
that
is
the
average
country
boy
the
normal
country
boy
had
to
work
quite
as
hard
in
the
city
as
he
ever
worked
in
the
country
and
his
wages
were
anything
but
princely
unequipped
with
a
city
trade
unprotected
by
a
union
and
so
forced
into
competition
with
the
lowest
types
of
foreign
labor
he
had
to
be
content
with
monotonous
uninspiring
and
jobs
he
did
not
become
a
or
even
a
plumber
until
the
war
gave
him
a
temporary
chance
at
its
gigantic
swag
he
became
a
car
conductor
a
porter
or
a
and
it
took
him
many
years
to
escape
from
that
sordid
fate
for
the
city
boy
with
a
better
education
and
better
connections
was
always
a
lap
or
two
ahead
of
him
the
notion
that
yokels
always
succeed
in
the
cities
is
a
great
delusion
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
rich
men
are
and
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
elderly
motormen
forlorn
corner
grocerymen
neighborhood
carpenters
and
other
such
blank
cartridges
are
no
it
was
not
money
that
lured
the
adolescent
husbandman
to
the
cities
but
the
gay
life
what
he
dreamed
of
was
a
more
spacious
and
stimulating
existence
than
the
farm
could
offer
an
existence
crowded
with
intriguing
and
usually
unlawful
recreations
a
few
old
farmers
may
have
come
in
now
and
then
to
buy
gold
bricks
or
to
hear
the
current
henry
ward
beechers
but
these
oldsters
were
mere
trippers
they
never
thought
of
settling
down
the
very
notion
of
it
would
have
appalled
them
the
actual
settlers
were
all
young
and
what
brought
them
on
was
less
an
economic
impulse
than
an
æsthetic
one
they
wanted
to
live
magnificently
to
taste
the
sweets
that
drummers
talked
of
to
sample
the
refined
divertisements
described
in
such
works
as
the
confessions
of
an
actress
night
life
in
chicago
and
what
every
young
husband
should
know
specifically
they
yearned
for
a
semester
or
two
in
the
theaters
the
saloons
and
the
bordellos
particularly
the
saloons
and
bordellos
it
was
this
gorgeous
bait
that
dragged
them
out
of
their
it
was
this
bait
that
landed
a
select
few
in
wall
street
and
the
united
states
senate
and
millions
on
the
front
seats
of
and
but
now
puritanism
eats
the
bait
in
all
our
great
cities
the
public
stews
are
closed
and
the
lamentable
irregularities
they
catered
to
are
thrown
upon
an
individual
initiative
that
is
quite
beyond
the
talents
and
enterprise
of
a
now
the
saloons
are
closed
too
and
the
begin
to
charge
such
prices
that
no
peasant
can
hope
to
pay
them
only
the
theater
remains
and
already
the
theater
loses
its
old
lavish
devilishness
true
enough
it
still
deals
in
pornography
but
that
pornography
becomes
exclusive
and
even
esoteric
a
yokel
could
not
understand
the
higher
farce
nor
could
he
afford
to
pay
for
a
seat
at
a
modern
the
cheap
burlesque
house
of
other
days
is
now
incurably
moral
i
saw
a
burlesque
show
lately
which
was
almost
a
dramatization
of
a
by
frank
crane
there
remains
the
movie
but
the
peasant
need
come
to
the
city
to
see
movies
there
is
one
in
every
village
what
remains
then
of
the
old
lure
what
sane
youth
comfortably
housed
on
a
farm
with
theda
bara
performing
at
the
nearest
wheat
at
a
bushel
and
milkers
getting
a
month
and
board
what
jejune
rustic
not
downright
imbecile
itches
for
the
city
and
in
the
department
of
amour
i
daresay
the
first
effect
of
prohibition
will
be
to
raise
up
impediments
to
marriage
it
was
alcohol
in
the
past
that
was
the
primary
cause
of
perhaps
a
majority
of
alliances
among
civilized
folk
the
man
priming
himself
with
cocktails
to
achieve
boldness
found
himself
suddenly
bogged
in
sentimentality
and
so
yielded
to
the
ancient
tricks
of
the
lady
absolutely
sober
men
will
be
harder
to
snare
coffee
will
never
mellow
them
sufficiently
thus
i
look
for
a
fall
in
the
marriage
rate
but
only
temporarily
in
the
long
run
prohibition
will
make
marriage
more
popular
at
least
among
the
upper
classes
than
it
has
ever
been
in
the
past
and
for
the
plain
reason
that
once
it
is
in
full
effect
the
life
of
a
civilized
bachelor
will
become
intolerable
in
the
past
he
went
to
his
club
but
a
club
without
a
bar
is
as
hideously
unattractive
as
a
beautiful
girl
without
hair
or
teeth
no
sane
man
will
go
into
it
in
two
years
in
fact
nine
out
of
ten
clubs
will
be
closed
the
only
survivors
will
be
a
few
bleak
rookeries
for
senile
widowers
the
bachelor
of
less
years
unable
to
put
up
with
the
society
of
such
infernos
will
inevitably
decide
that
if
he
must
keep
sober
he
might
just
as
well
have
a
charming
girl
to
ease
his
agonies
and
so
he
will
expose
himself
in
society
and
some
fair
one
or
other
will
nab
him
at
the
moment
observing
only
the
first
effect
of
prohibition
the
great
majority
of
intelligent
women
are
opposed
to
it
but
when
the
secondary
effect
begins
to
appear
they
will
become
in
favor
of
it
they
now
have
the
vote
i
see
no
hope
triumph
of
another
effect
of
prohibition
will
be
that
it
will
gradually
empty
the
united
states
of
its
present
small
minority
of
civilized
men
almost
every
man
that
one
respects
is
now
casting
longing
eyes
across
the
ocean
some
of
them
talk
frankly
of
emigrating
once
europe
pulls
itself
together
others
merely
propose
to
go
abroad
every
year
and
to
stay
there
as
long
as
possible
visiting
the
united
states
only
at
intervals
as
a
russian
nobleman
say
used
to
visit
his
estates
in
the
ukraine
worse
prohibition
will
scare
off
all
the
better
sort
of
immigrants
from
the
other
side
the
lower
order
of
laborers
may
continue
to
come
in
small
numbers
each
planning
to
get
all
the
money
he
can
and
then
escape
as
the
italians
are
even
now
escaping
but
no
man
will
ever
come
no
stephen
girard
or
william
osier
or
carl
schurz
or
theodore
thomas
or
louis
agassiz
or
edwin
klebs
or
albert
gallatin
or
alexander
hamilton
it
is
not
prohibition
that
will
keep
them
away
it
is
the
whole
complex
of
social
and
political
attitudes
underlying
prohibition
the
whole
clinical
picture
of
puritanism
rampant
the
united
states
will
become
a
sort
of
huge
holland
fat
and
contented
but
essentially
undistinguished
its
superior
men
will
leave
it
automatically
as
of
all
superior
hollanders
leave
holland
but
all
this
from
the
standpoint
of
prohibitionists
is
no
argument
against
prohibition
on
the
contrary
it
is
an
argument
in
favor
of
prohibition
for
the
men
the
prohibitionist
the
inferior
sort
of
puritan
distrusts
and
dislikes
most
intensely
is
precisely
what
the
rest
of
humanity
regards
as
the
superior
man
you
will
go
wrong
if
you
imagine
that
the
honest
yeomen
of
say
mississippi
deplore
the
fact
that
in
the
whole
state
there
is
not
a
single
distinguished
man
they
actually
delight
in
it
it
is
a
source
of
genuine
pride
to
them
that
no
such
irreligious
scoundrel
as
balzac
lives
there
and
no
such
scandalous
adulterer
as
wagner
and
no
scoundrelly
atheist
as
huxley
and
no
such
rambunctious
as
beethoven
and
no
such
german
spy
as
nietzsche
such
men
settling
there
would
be
visited
by
a
vigilance
committee
and
sharply
questioned
the
puritan
commonwealth
now
as
always
has
no
traffic

heretics
x

on
a
tender
theme
nature
of
whatever
the
origin
in
the
soul
the
ductless
glands
or
the
convolutions
of
the
cerebrum
of
the
thing
called
romantic
love
its
mere
phenomenal
nature
may
be
very
simply
described
it
is
in
brief
a
wholesale
diminishing
of
disgusts
primarily
based
on
observation
but
often
in
its
later
stages
taking
on
an
hallucinatory
and
pathological
character
friendship
has
precisely
the
same
constitution
but
the
pathological
factor
is
usually
absent
when
we
are
attracted
to
a
person
and
find
his
or
her
proximity
agreeable
it
means
that
he
or
she
disgusts
us
less
than
the
average
human
being
disgusts
us
which
if
we
have
delicate
sensibilities
is
a
good
deal
more
than
is
comfortable
the
elemental
man
is
not
much
oppressed
by
this
capacity
for
disgust
in
consequence
he
is
capable
of
falling
in
love
with
almost
any
woman
who
seems
sexually
normal
but
the
man
of
a
higher
type
is
vastly
more
sniffish
and
so
the
majority
of
women
whom
he
meets
are
quite
unable
to
interest
him
and
when
he
succumbs
at
last
it
is
always
to
a
woman
of
special
character
and
often
she
is
also
one
of
uncommon
shrewdness
and
enterprise
because
human
contacts
are
chiefly
superficial
most
of
the
disgusts
that
we
are
conscious
of
are
physical
we
are
never
honestly
friendly
with
a
man
who
is
dirtier
than
we
are
ourselves
or
who
has
table
manners
that
are
cruder
than
our
own
or
merely
noticeably
different
or
who
laughs
in
a
way
that
strikes
us
as
gross
or
who
radiates
some
odor
that
we
do
not
like
we
never
conceive
a
romantic
passion
for
a
woman
who
employs
a
toothpick
in
public
or
who
suffers
from
acne
or
who
offers
the
subtle
but
often
quite
unescapable
suggestion
that
she
has
on
soiled
underwear
but
there
are
also
psychical
disgusts
our
friends
in
the
main
must
be
persons
who
think
substantially
as
we
do
at
least
about
all
things
that
actively
concern
us
and
who
have
the
same
general
tastes
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
brahmsianer
being
honestly
fond
of
a
man
who
enjoys
jazz
or
a
man
who
admires
joseph
conrad
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
who
reads
rex
beach
by
the
same
token
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
woman
of
genuine
refinement
falling
in
love
with
a
knight
of
pythias
a
methodist
or
even
a
chauffeur
either
the
chauffeur
is
a
harvard
aviator
in
disguise
or
the
lady
herself
is
a
charwoman
in
disguise
here
however
the
force
of
aversion
may
be
greatly
diminished
by
contrary
physical
attractions
the
body
as
usual
is
enormously
more
potent
than
the
mind
in
the
midst
of
the
bitterest
wars
with
every
man
of
the
enemy
held
to
be
a
fiend
in
human
form
women
constantly
fall
in
love
with
enemy
soldiers
who
are
of
pleasant
person
and
wear
attractive
uniforms
and
many
a
fair
agnostic
as
every
one
knows
is
on
good
terms
with
a
handsome
priest
imagine
a
young
man
in
good
health
and
easy
circumstances
entirely
ripe
for
love
the
prompting
to
mate
and
beget
arises
within
his
interstitial
depths
traverses
his
lymphatic
system
lifts
his
blood
pressure
and
goes
whooping
through
his
auditorium
like
a
fanfare
of
slide
trombones
the
impulse
is
very
powerful
it
staggers
and
dismays
him
he
trembles
like
a
stag
at
bay
why
then
does
he
fall
head
over
heels
in
love
with
the
first
eligible
woman
that
he
meets
for
the
plain
reason
that
the
majority
of
women
that
he
meets
offend
him
repel
him
disgust
him
often
it
is
in
some
small
inconspicuous
and
at
first
glance
unanalyzable
way
she
is
in
general
a
very
pretty
girl
but
her
ears
stand
out
too
much
or
her
hair
reminds
him
of
oakum
or
her
mouth
looks
like
his
aunt
or
she
has
ankles
here
very
impalpable
things
such
as
bodily
odors
play
a
capital
part
their
importance
is
always
much
underestimated
many
a
girl
has
lost
a
husband
by
using
the
wrong
perfume
or
by
neglecting
to
have
her
hair
washed
many
another
has
come
to
grief
by
powdering
her
nose
too
much
or
too
little
or
by
shrinking
from
the
paltry
pain
of
having
some
of
her
eyebrows
pulled
or
by
employing
a
with
too
much
purple
in
it
or
by
patronizing
a
bad
dentist
or
by
speaking
incautiously
of
chilblains
but
eventually
the
youth
finds
his
love
soon
or
late
the
angel
foreordained
comes
along
who
is
this
prodigy
simply
the
girl
to
sneak
over
what
may
be
called
the
threshold
of
his
disgusts
simply
the
to
disgust
him
so
little
at
first
glance
that
the
loud
insistent
promptings
of
the
divine
schadchen
have
a
chance
to
be
heard
if
he
muffs
this
first
another
will
come
along
maybe
soon
maybe
late
for
every
normal
man
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
in
christendom
thousands
in
his
own
town
scores
within
his
own
circle
of
acquaintance
this
normal
man
is
not
too
delicate
his
fixed
foci
of
disgust
are
neither
very
numerous
nor
very
sensitive
for
the
rest
he
is
swayed
by
fashion
by
suggestion
by
transient
moods
anon
a
mood
of
cynicism
is
upon
him
and
he
is
hard
to
please
but
anon
he
succumbs
to
sentimentality
and
is
blind
to
everything
save
the
grossest
offendings
it
is
only
the
man
of
extraordinary
sensitiveness
the
man
of
hypertrophied
delicacy
who
must
search
the
world
for
his
elective
affinity
once
the
threshold
is
crossed
emotion
comes
to
the
aid
of
perception
that
is
to
say
the
blind
almost
irresistible
mating
impulse
now
fortuitously
relieved
from
the
contrary
pressure
of
active
disgusts
fortifies
itself
by
manufacturing
illusions
the
lover
sees
with
an
eye
that
is
both
opaque
and
out
of
focus
thus
he
begins
the
familiar
process
of
editing
and
improving
his
girl
features
and
characteristics
that
observed
in
cold
blood
might
have
quickly
aroused
his
most
active
disgust
are
now
seen
through
a
fog
like
drabs
in
a
musical
comedy
the
lover
ends
by
being
almost
anæsthetic
to
disgust
while
the
spell
lasts
his
lady
could
shave
her
head
or
take
to
rubbing
snuff
or
scratch
her
leg
at
a
communion
service
or
smear
her
hair
with
bear
grease
and
yet
not
disgust
him
here
the
paralysis
of
the
faculties
is
again
chiefly
physical
a
matter
of
obscure
secretions
of
shifting
pressure
of
metabolism
nature
is
at
her
tricks
the
fever
of
love
is
upon
its
victim
his
guard
down
he
is
little
more
than
a
pathetic
automaton
the
shrewd
observer
of
gaucheries
the
sensitive
sniffer
the
erstwhile
cynic
has
become
a
mere
potential
papa
this
spell
of
course
does
last
forever
marriage
cools
the
fever
and
lowers
the
threshold
of
disgust
the
husband
begins
to
observe
what
the
lover
was
blind
to
and
often
his
discoveries
affect
him
as
unpleasantly
as
the
treason
of
a
trusted
friend
and
not
only
is
the
fever
cooled
the
opportunities
for
exact
observation
are
enormously
increased
it
is
a
commonplace
of
juridical
science
that
the
great
majority
of
divorces
have
their
origin
in
the
connubial
chamber
here
intimacy
is
so
extreme
that
it
is
fatal
to
illusion
both
parties
thrown
into
the
closest
human
contact
that
either
has
suffered
since
their
unconscious
days
utero
find
their
old
capacity
for
disgust
reviving
and
then
suddenly
flaming
the
girl
who
was
perfect
in
her
wedding
gown
becomes
a
ghastly
caricature
in
her
de
nuit
the
man
who
was
a
chevalier
bayard
as
a
wooer
becomes
a
snuffling
shambling
driveling
nuisance
as
a
husband
a
fellow
offensive
to
eyes
ears
nose
touch
and
immortal
soul
a
learned
judge
of
my
acquaintance
constantly
hearing
divorce
actions
and
as
constantly
striving
to
reconcile
the
parties
always
tries
to
induce
plaintiff
and
defendant
to
live
apart
for
a
while
or
failing
that
to
occupy
separate
rooms
or
failing
that
to
at
least
dress
in
separate
rooms
according
to
this
jurist
a
husband
who
shaves
in
his
presence
is
either
an
idiot
or
a
scoundrel
the
spectacle
he
argues
is
intrinsically
disgusting
and
to
force
it
upon
a
refined
woman
is
either
to
subject
her
to
the
most
exquisite
torture
or
to
degrade
her
gradually
to
the
insensate
level
of
an
the
day
is
saved
as
every
one
knows
by
the
powerful
effects
of
habit
the
acquisition
of
habit
is
the
process
whereby
disgust
is
overcome
in
daily
life
the
process
whereby
one
may
cease
to
be
disgusted
by
a
persistent
noise
or
odor
one
suffers
horribly
at
first
but
after
a
bit
one
suffers
less
and
in
the
course
of
time
one
scarcely
suffers
at
all
thus
a
man
when
his
marriage
enters
upon
the
stage
of
regularity
and
safety
gets
used
to
his
wife
as
he
might
get
used
to
a
tannery
next
door
and
i
think
that
women
in
this
direction
have
the
harder
row
to
hoe
for
they
are
more
observant
than
men
and
vastly
more
sensitive
in
small
ways
but
even
women
succumb
to
habit
with
humane
rapidity
else
every
marriage
would
end
in
divorce
disgusts
pale
into
mere
dislikes
disrelishes
distastes
they
cease
to
gag
and
torture
but
though
they
thus
shrink
into
the
shadow
they
are
by
no
means
disposed
of
deep
down
in
the
subconscious
they
continue
to
lurk
and
some
accident
may
cause
them
to
flare
up
at
any
time
and
so
work
havoc
this
flaring
up
accounts
for
a
familiar
and
yet
usually
very
mystifying
phenomenon
the
sudden
collapse
of
a
marriage
a
friendship
or
a
business
association
after
years
of
apparent
prosperity
incomparable
the
chief
and
perhaps
the
only
genuine
charm
of
women
is
seldom
mentioned
by
the
orthodox
professors
of
the
sex
i
refer
to
the
charm
that
lies
in
the
dangers
they
present
the
allurement
that
they
hold
out
to
men
is
precisely
the
allurement
that
cape
hatteras
holds
out
to
sailors
they
are
enormously
dangerous
and
hence
enormously
fascinating
to
the
average
man
doomed
to
some
banal
and
sordid
drudgery
all
his
life
long
they
offer
the
only
grand
hazard
that
he
ever
encounters
take
them
away
and
his
existence
would
be
as
flat
and
secure
as
that
of
a
even
to
the
unusual
man
the
adventurous
man
the
imaginative
and
romantic
man
they
offer
the
adventure
of
adventures
civilization
tends
to
dilute
and
cheapen
all
other
hazards
war
itself
once
an
enterprise
stupendously
thrilling
has
been
reduced
to
mere
caution
and
calculation
already
indeed
it
employs
as
many
and
chautauqua
orators
as
soldiers
on
some
not
distant
its
salient
personality
may
be
potash
and
if
not
potash
then
perlmutter
but
the
duel
of
sex
continues
to
be
fought
in
the
berserker
manner
whoso
approaches
women
still
faces
the
immemorial
dangers
civilization
has
not
made
them
a
bit
more
safe
than
they
were
in
solomon
time
they
are
still
inordinately
barbarous
and
menacing
and
hence
inordinately
provocative
and
hence
inordinately
charming
and
romantic
the
most
disgusting
cad
in
the
world
is
the
man
who
on
grounds
of
decorum
and
morality
avoids
the
game
of
love
he
is
one
who
puts
his
own
ease
and
security
above
the
most
laudable
of
philanthropies
women
have
a
hard
time
of
it
in
this
world
they
are
oppressed
by
laws
social
customs
masculine
egoism
the
delusion
of
masculine
superiority
their
one
comfort
is
the
assurance
that
even
though
it
may
be
impossible
to
prevail
against
man
it
is
always
possible
to
enslave
and
torture
a
man
this
feeling
is
fostered
when
one
makes
love
to
them
one
need
not
be
a
great
beau
a
seductive
catch
to
do
it
effectively
any
man
is
better
than
none
no
woman
is
ever
offended
by
admiration
the
wife
of
a
millionaire
notes
the
reverent
glance
of
a
to
withhold
that
devotion
to
shrink
poltroonishly
from
giving
so
much
happiness
at
such
small
expense
to
evade
the
business
on
the
ground
that
it
has
hazards
this
is
the
act
of
a
puling
and
tacky
fellow
as
women
when
it
comes
to
snaring
men
through
the
eye
bait
a
great
many
hooks
that
fail
to
fluster
the
fish
of
their
primping
and
decorating
of
their
persons
not
only
does
please
men
it
actually
repels
men
i
often
pass
two
days
running
without
encountering
a
single
woman
who
is
charmingly
dressed
nearly
all
of
them
run
to
painful
color
schemes
absurd
designs
and
excessive
one
seldom
observes
a
man
who
looks
an
absolute
guy
whereas
such
women
are
very
numerous
in
the
average
theater
audience
they
constitute
a
majority
of
at
least
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
the
clothes
of
men
are
plain
in
design
and
neutral
in
hue
the
only
touch
of
genuine
color
is
in
the
florid
blob
of
the
face
the
center
of
interest
exactly
where
it
ought
to
be
if
there
is
any
other
color
at
all
it
is
a
faint
suggestion
in
the
cravat
adjacent
to
the
face
and
so
leading
the
eye
toward
it
it
is
color
that
kills
the
clothes
of
the
average
woman
she
runs
to
bright
spots
that
take
the
eye
away
from
her
face
and
hair
she
ceases
to
be
woman
clothed
and
becomes
a
mere
piece
of
clothing
womaned
even
at
the
basic
feminine
art
of
pigmenting
their
faces
very
few
women
excel
the
average
woman
seems
to
think
that
she
is
most
lovely
when
her
sophistication
of
her
complexion
is
most
adroitly
concealed
when
the
de
is
rubbed
in
so
hard
that
it
is
almost
invisible
and
the
penciling
of
eyes
and
lips
is
perfectly
realistic
this
is
a
false
notion
most
men
of
appreciative
eye
have
no
objection
to
artificiality
se
so
long
as
it
is
intrinsically
sightly
the
marks

by

beautiful

are

man
with
eyes
in
his
head
admires
them
for
themselves
he
does
have
to
be
first
convinced
that
they
are
that
what
he
sees
is
not
the
mark
of
a
at
all
but
an
authentic
lip
so
with
the
eyes
nothing
could
be
more
charming
than
an
eye
properly
reënforced
the
naked
organ
is
not
to
be
compared
to
it
nature
is
an
idiot
when
it
comes
to
shadows
but
it
must
be
admired
as
a
work
of
art
not
as
a
miraculous
and
incredible
eye
women
in
this
important
and
venerable
art
stick
too
closely
to
crude
representation
they
forget
that
men
do
not
admire
the
technique
but
the
result
what
they
should
do
is
to
forget
realism
for
a
while
and
concentrate
their
attention
upon
composition
chiaroscuro
and
color
and
the
much
gabble
is
to
be
found
in
the
literature
of
the
world
upon
the
function
of
woman
as
inspiration
stimulant
and
to
the
creative
artist
the
subject
is
a
favorite
one
with
sentimentalists
most
of
whom
are
quite
beyond
anything
properly
describable
as
inspiration
either
with
or
without
feminine
aid
i
incline
to
think
as
i
hint
that
there
is
little
if
any
basis
of
fact
beneath
the
theory
women
not
only
do
not
inspire
creative
artists
to
high
endeavor
they
actually
stand
firmly
against
every
high
endeavor
that
a
creative
artist
initiates
spontaneously
what
a
man
women
folks
almost
invariable
ask
of
him
is
that
he
be
respectable
that
he
do
something
generally
approved
that
he
avoid
yielding
to
his
aberrant
fancies
in
brief
that
he
sedulously
eschew
showing
any
sign
of
genuine
genius
their
interest
is
not
primarily
in
the
of
the
individual
but
in
the
of
the
family
organization
which
means
the
safety
of
themselves
no
sane
woman
would
want
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
say
as
nietzsche
or
chopin
his
mistress
perhaps
yes
for
a
mistress
can
always
move
on
when
the
weather
gets
too
warm
but
not
a
wife
i
here
speak
by
the
book
both
nietzsche
and
chopin
had
plenty
of
mistresses
but
neither
was
ever
able
to
get
a
wife
shakespeare
and
ann
hathaway
wagner
and
minna
planer
molière
and
armande
béjart
one
might
multiply
instances
almost
endlessly
minna
at
least
in
theory
knew
something
of
music
she
was
thus
what
romance
regards
as
an
ideal
wife
for
wagner
but
instead
of
helping
him
to
manufacture
his
incomparable
masterpieces
she
was
for
years
the
chief
impediment
to
their
manufacture
lohengrin
gave
her
the
horrors
she
begged
richard
to
give
up
his
lunacies
and
return
to
the
composition
of
respectable
cornet
music
in
the
end
he
had
to
get
rid
of
her
in
sheer
once
free
with
nothing
worse
on
his
hands
than
the
illicit
affection
of
cosima
liszt
von
bülow
he
produced
music
drama
after
music
drama
in
rapid
succession
then
married
to
cosima
he
descended
to
the
anticlimax
of
parsifal
a
truly
tragic
mixture
of
the
stupendous
and
the
banal
of
work
of
genius
and
a
great
man
dying
by
inches
smothered
by
the
smoke
of
french
fried
potatoes
deafened
by
the
wailing
of
children
murdered
in
his
own
house
by
the
holiest
of
passions
sentimentalists
always
bring
up
the
case
of
schumann
and
his
clara
in
rebuttal
but
does
it
actually
rebut
i
doubt
it
clara
too
perpetrated
her
against
art
her
fair
white
arms
lifting
from
the
keyboard
to
encircle
robert
neck
squeezed
more
out
of
him
than
mere
fatuous
smirks
he
had
the
best
head
on
him
that
music
had
seen
since
beethoven
day
he
was
on
the
cerebral
side
a
colossus
he
might
have
written
music
of
the
very
first
order
well
what
he
write
was
piano
music
some
of
it
imperfectly
arranged
for
orchestra
the
sad
eyes
of
clara
were
always
upon
him
he
kept
within
the
limits
of
her
intelligence
her
prejudices
her
wifely
love
no
grand
experiments
with
the
orchestra
no
superb
leapings
and
cavortings
no
rubbing
of
over
critical
ears
robert
lived
and
died
a
respectable
musical
he
was
a
man
of
genuine
genius
but
he
did
leave
ten
lines
that
might
not
have
been
passed
by
old
jadassohn
the
truth
is
that
no
matter
how
great
the
domestic
concord
and
how
lavish
the
sacrifices
a
man
makes
for
his
they
almost
always
regard
him
secretly
as
a
silly
and
selfish
fellow
and
cherish
the
theory
that
it
would
be
easily
possible
to
improve
him
this
is
because
the
essential
interests
of
men
and
women
are
eternally
antithetical
a
man
may
yield
over
and
over
again
but
in
the
long
run
he
must
occasionally
look
out
for
himself
and
it
is
these
occasions
that
his
remember
the
typical
domestic
situation
shows
a
woman
trying
to
induce
a
man
to
do
something
that
he
does
want
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
something
that
he
does
want
to
do
this
is
true
in
his
bachelor
days
when
his
mother
or
his
sister
is
his
antagonist
it
is
preëminently
true
just
before
his
marriage
when
the
girl
who
has
marked
him
down
is
hard
at
the
colossal
job
of
overcoming
his
reluctance
and
after
marriage
it
is
so
true
that
there
is
hardly
need
to
state
it
one
of
the
things
every
man
discovers
to
his
disquiet
is
that
his
wife
after
the
first
is
over
regards
him
essentially
as
his
mother
used
to
regard
him
that
is
as
a
who
needs
to
be
policed
and
an
idiot
who
needs
to
be
protected
the
notion
that
women
their
is
pure
moonshine
the
most
they
ever
achieve
in
that
direction
is
to
pity
them
when
a
woman
genuinely
loves
a
man
it
is
a
sign
that
she
regards
him
much
as
a
healthy
man
regards
a
and
epileptic
soldier
nearly
the
whole
case
of
the
who
now
roar
in
christendom
is
grounded
upon
the
doctrine
that
it
is
an
intolerable
outrage
for
a
woman
to
have
to
submit
to
motherhood
when
her
private
fancies
may
rather
incline
to
automobiling
shopping
or
going
to
the
movies
for
this
curse
the
husband
is
blamed
the
whole
crime
is
laid
to
his
swinish
lasciviousness
with
the
highest
respect
nonsense
my
private
suspicion
supported
by
long
observation
copious
prayer
and
the
most
laborious
cogitation
is
that
no
woman
delights
in
motherhood
so
vastly
as
this
woman
who
theoretically
abhors
it
she
experiences
in
fact
a
double
delight
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
caressing
of
her
vanity
a
thing
enjoyed
by
every
woman
when
she
achieves
the
banality
of
viable
offspring
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
fine
chance
it
gives
her
to
play
the
martyr
a
chance
that
every
woman
seeks
as
diligently
as
a
man
seeks
ease
all
these
unwilling
mothers
wallow
in
their
martyrdom
they
revel
in
the
opportunity
to
be
pitied
made
much
over
and
envied
by
other
women
burnt
the
fundamental
trouble
with
marriage
is
that
it
shakes
a
confidence
in
himself
and
so
greatly
diminishes
his
general
competence
and
effectiveness
his
habit
of
mind
becomes
that
of
a
commander
who
has
lost
a
decisive
and
calamitous
battle
he
never
quite
trusts
himself
thereafter
supreme
marriage
at
best
is
full
of
a
sour
and
inescapable
comedy
but
it
never
reaches
the
highest
peaks
of
the
ludicrous
save
when
efforts
are
made
to
escape
its
terms
that
is
when
efforts
are
made
to
loosen
its
bonds
and
so
ameliorate
and
denaturize
it
all
projects
to
reform
it
by
converting
it
into
a
free
union
of
free
individuals
are
inherently
absurd
the
thing
is
at
bottom
the
most
rigid
of
existing
conventionalities
and
the
only
way
to
conceal
the
fact
and
so
make
it
bearable
is
to
submit
to
it
docilely
the
effect
of
every
revolt
is
merely
to
make
the
bonds
galling
and
what
is
worse
poignantly
obvious
who
are
happy
in
marriage
those
with
so
little
imagination
that
they
can
not
picture
a
better
state
and
those
so
shrewd
that
they
prefer
quiet
slavery
to
hopeless
rebellion
hidden
many
a
woman
in
order
to
bring
the
man
of
her
choice
to
the
altar
of
god
has
to
fight
him
with
such
relentless
vigilance
and
ferocity
that
she
comes
to
hate
him
this
perhaps
explains
the
unhappiness
of
many
marriages
in
particular
it
explains
the
unhappiness
of
many
marriages
based
upon
what
is
called
love
the
essential
slackness
and
incompetence
of
women
their
congenital
incapacity
for
small
expertness
already
descanted
upon
at
length
in
my
psychological
work
in
defense
of
women
is
never
more
plainly
revealed
than
in
their
manhandling
of
the
primary
business
of
their
sex
if
the
average
woman
were
as
competent
at
her
trade
of
getting
a
husband
as
the
average
car
conductor
is
at
his
trade
of
robbing
the
then
a
bachelor
beyond
the
age
of
would
be
so
rare
in
the
world
that
yokels
would
pay
ten
cents
to
gape
at
him
but
women
in
this
fundamental
industry
pursue
a
faulty
technique
and
permit
themselves
to
be
led
astray
by
unsound
principles
the
axioms
into
which
they
have
precipitated
their
wisdom
are
nearly
all
untrue
for
example
the
axiom
that
the
way
to
capture
a
man
is
through
his
stomach
which
is
to
say
by
feeding
him
lavishly
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
the
average
man
at
least
in
england
and
america
has
such
rudimentary
tastes
in
victualry
that
he
does
know
good
food
from
bad
he
will
eat
anything
set
before
him
by
a
cook
that
he
likes
the
true
way
to
fetch
him
is
with
drinks
a
single
bottle
of
drinkable
wine
will
fill
more
men
with
the
passion
of
love
than
ten
sides
of
beef
or
a
ton
of
potatoes
even
a
of
beer
deftly
applied
is
enough
to
mellow
the
hardest
bachelor
if
women
really
knew
their
business
they
would
have
abandoned
cooking
centuries
ago
and
devoted
themselves
to
brewing
distilling
and
bartending
it
is
a
rare
man
who
will
walk
five
blocks
for
a
meal
but
it
is
equally
a
rare
man
who
even
in
the
old
days
of
freedom
would
walk
five
blocks
for
a
cocktail
he
would
walk
five
miles
another
unsound
feminine
axiom
is
the
one
to
the
effect
that
the
way
to
capture
a
man
is
to
be
distant
to
throw
all
the
burden
of
the
courtship
upon
him
this
is
precisely
the
way
to
lose
him
a
man
face
to
face
with
a
girl
who
seems
reserved
and
unapproachable
is
not
inspired
thereby
to
drag
her
off
in
the
manner
of
a
caveman
on
the
contrary
he
is
inspired
to
thank
god
that
here
at
last
is
a
girl
with
whom
it
is
possible
to
have
friendly
doings
without
getting
into
trouble
that
here
is
one
not
likely
to
grow
mushy
and
make
a
mess
the
average
man
does
not
marry
because
some
marble
fair
one
challenges
his
enterprise
he
marries
because
chance
throws
into
his
way
a
fair
one
who
repels
him
less
actively
than
most
and
because
his
delight
in
what
he
thus
calls
her
charm
is
reënforced
by
a
growing
suspicion
that
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
in
brief
it
is
chivalry
that
undoes
him
the
girl
who
infallibly
gets
a
husband
in
fact
husband
that
she
wants
is
the
one
who
tracks
him
boldly
fastens
him
with
sad
eyes
and
then
when
his
conscience
has
begun
to
torture
him
throws
her
arms
around
his
neck
bursts
into
maidenly
tears
on
his
shoulder
and
tells
him
that
she
fears
her
forwardness
will
destroy
his
respect
for
her
it
is
only
a
colossus
who
can
resist
such
strategy
but
it
takes
only
a
man
of
the
intellectual
grade
of
a
secretary
to
elude
the
girl
who
is
afraid
to
take
the
offensive
a
third
bogus
axiom
i
have
already
discussed
to
wit
the
axiom
that
a
man
is
repelled
by
palpable
cosmetics
that
the
wise
girl
is
the
one
who
effectively
conceals
her
sophistication
of
her
complexion
what
could
be
more
untrue
the
fact
is
that
very
few
men
are
competent
to
distinguish
between
a
layer
of
talc
and
the
authentic
epidermis
and
that
the
few
who
have
the
gift
are
quite
free
from
any
notion
that
the
latter
is
superior
to
the
former
what
a
man
seeks
when
he
enters
the
society
of
women
is
something
pleasing
to
the
eye
that
is
all
he
asks
he
does
not
waste
any
time
upon
a
chemical
or
spectroscopic
examination
of
the
object
observed
he
simply
determines
whether
it
is
beautiful
or
not
beautiful
has
it
so
long
escaped
women
that
their
husbands
when
led
astray
are
usually
led
astray
by
women
so
vastly
besmeared
with
cosmetics
that
they
resemble
more
than
human
beings
are
they
yet
blind
to
the
superior
pull
of
a
french
maid
a
chorus
girl
a
stenographer
begauded
like
a
painter
palette
and
still
they
go
on
rubbing
off
their
varnish
brushing
the
lampblack
from
their
eyelashes
seeking
eternally
the
that
is
so
depressingly
purple
that
it
will
deceive
alas
what
