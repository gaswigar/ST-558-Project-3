some
years
ago
my
wife
was
in
poor
health
and
our
family
doctor
in
whose
skill
and
honesty
i
had
implicit
confidence
advised
a
change
of
climate
i
shared
from
an
unprofessional
standpoint
his
opinion
that
the
raw
winds
the
chill
rains
and
the
violent
changes
of
temperature
that
characterized
the
winters
in
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
tended
to
aggravate
my
wife
difficulty
and
would
undoubtedly
shorten
her
life
if
she
remained
exposed
to
them
the
doctor
advice
was
that
we
seek
not
a
temporary
place
of
sojourn
but
a
permanent
residence
in
a
warmer
and
more
equable
climate
i
was
engaged
at
the
time
in
in
northern
ohio
and
as
i
liked
the
business
and
had
given
it
much
study
i
decided
to
look
for
some
other
locality
suitable
for
carrying
it
on
i
thought
of
sunny
france
of
sleepy
spain
of
southern
california
but
there
were
objections
to
them
all
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
find
what
i
wanted
in
some
one
of
our
own
southern
states
it
was
a
sufficient
time
after
the
war
for
conditions
in
the
south
to
have
become
somewhat
settled
and
i
was
enough
of
a
pioneer
to
start
a
new
industry
if
i
could
not
find
a
place
where
had
been
tried
i
wrote
to
a
cousin
who
had
gone
into
the
turpentine
business
in
central
north
carolina
he
assured
me
in
response
to
my
inquiries
that
no
better
place
could
be
found
in
the
south
than
the
state
and
neighborhood
where
he
lived
the
climate
was
perfect
for
health
and
in
conjunction
with
the
soil
ideal
for
labor
was
cheap
and
land
could
be
bought
for
a
mere
song
he
gave
us
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
and
visit
him
while
we
looked
into
the
matter
we
accepted
the
invitation
and
after
several
days
of
leisurely
travel
the
last
hundred
miles
of
which
were
up
a
river
on
a
sidewheel
steamer
we
reached
our
destination
a
quaint
old
town
which
i
shall
call
patesville
because
for
one
reason
that
is
not
its
name
there
was
a
red
brick
in
the
public
square
with
a
tall
tower
which
held
a
clock
that
struck
the
hours
and
from
which
there
pealed
out
a
curfew
at
nine
there
were
two
or
three
hotels
a
a
jail
stores
offices
and
all
the
appurtenances
of
a
county
seat
and
a
commercial
emporium
for
while
patesville
numbered
only
four
or
five
thousand
inhabitants
of
all
shades
of
complexion
it
was
one
of
the
principal
towns
in
north
carolina
and
had
a
considerable
trade
in
cotton
and
naval
stores
this
business
activity
was
not
immediately
apparent
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
indeed
when
i
first
saw
the
town
there
brooded
over
it
a
calm
that
seemed
almost
sabbatic
in
its
restfulness
though
i
learned
later
on
that
underneath
its
somnolent
exterior
the
deeper
currents
of
life
love
and
hatred
joy
and
despair
ambition
and
avarice
faith
and
friendship
flowed
not
less
steadily
than
in
livelier
latitudes
we
found
the
weather
delightful
at
that
season
the
end
of
summer
and
were
hospitably
entertained
our
host
was
a
man
of
means
and
evidently
regarded
our
visit
as
a
pleasure
and
we
were
therefore
correspondingly
at
our
ease
and
in
a
position
to
act
with
the
coolness
of
judgment
desirable
in
making
so
radical
a
change
in
our
lives
my
cousin
placed
a
horse
and
buggy
at
our
disposal
and
himself
acted
as
our
guide
until
i
became
somewhat
familiar
with
the
country
i
found
that
while
it
had
never
been
carried
on
to
any
great
extent
was
not
entirely
unknown
in
the
neighborhood
several
planters
thereabouts
had
attempted
it
on
a
commercial
scale
in
former
years
with
greater
or
less
success
but
like
most
southern
industries
it
had
felt
the
blight
of
war
and
had
fallen
into
desuetude
i
went
several
times
to
look
at
a
place
that
i
thought
might
suit
me
it
was
a
plantation
of
considerable
extent
that
had
formerly
belonged
to
a
wealthy
man
by
the
name
of
mcadoo
the
estate
had
been
for
years
involved
in
litigation
between
disputing
heirs
during
which
period
shiftless
cultivation
had
exhausted
the
soil
there
had
been
a
vineyard
of
some
extent
on
the
place
but
it
had
not
been
attended
to
since
the
war
and
had
lapsed
into
utter
neglect
the
vines
here
partly
supported
by
decayed
and
trellises
there
twining
themselves
among
the
branches
of
the
slender
saplings
which
had
sprung
up
among
them
grew
in
wild
and
unpruned
luxuriance
and
the
few
scattered
grapes
they
bore
were
the
undisputed
prey
of
the
first
comer
the
site
was
admirably
adapted
to
the
soil
with
a
little
attention
could
not
have
been
better
and
with
the
native
grape
the
luscious
scuppernong
as
my
main
reliance
in
the
beginning
i
felt
sure
that
i
could
introduce
and
cultivate
successfully
a
number
of
other
varieties
one
day
i
went
over
with
my
wife
to
show
her
the
place
we
drove
out
of
the
town
over
a
long
wooden
bridge
that
spanned
a
spreading
passed
the
long
whitewashed
fence
surrounding
the
county
and
struck
into
a
road
so
sandy
that
the
horse
feet
sank
to
the
fetlocks
our
route
lay
partly
up
hill
and
partly
down
for
we
were
in
the
county
we
drove
past
cultivated
farms
and
then
by
abandoned
fields
grown
up
in
and
pine
and
once
or
twice
through
the
solemn
aisles
of
the
virgin
forest
where
the
tall
pines
meeting
over
the
narrow
road
shut
out
the
sun
and
wrapped
us
in
cloistral
solitude
once
at
a
i
was
in
doubt
as
to
the
turn
to
take
and
we
sat
there
waiting
ten
minutes
we
had
already
caught
some
of
the
native
infection
of
restfulness
for
some
human
being
to
come
along
who
could
direct
us
on
our
way
at
length
a
little
negro
girl
appeared
walking
straight
as
an
arrow
with
a
piggin
full
of
water
on
her
head
after
a
little
patient
investigation
necessary
to
overcome
the
child
shyness
we
learned
what
we
wished
to
know
and
at
the
end
of
about
five
miles
from
the
town
reached
our
destination
we
drove
between
a
pair
of
decayed
gateposts
the
gate
itself
had
long
since
disappeared
and
up
a
straight
sandy
lane
between
two
lines
of
rotting
rail
fence
partly
concealed
by
and
briers
to
the
open
space
where
a
had
once
stood
evidently
a
spacious
mansion
if
we
might
judge
from
the
ruined
chimneys
that
were
still
standing
and
the
brick
pillars
on
which
the
sills
rested
the
house
itself
we
had
been
informed
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
fortunes
of
war
we
alighted
from
the
buggy
walked
about
the
yard
for
a
while
and
then
wandered
off
into
the
adjoining
vineyard
upon
annie
complaining
of
weariness
i
led
the
way
back
to
the
yard
where
a
pine
log
lying
under
a
spreading
elm
afforded
a
shady
though
somewhat
hard
seat
one
end
of
the
log
was
already
occupied
by
a
colored
man
he
held
on
his
knees
a
hat
full
of
grapes
over
which
he
was
smacking
his
lips
with
great
gusto
and
a
pile
of
grapeskins
near
him
indicated
that
the
performance
was
no
new
thing
we
approached
him
at
an
angle
from
the
rear
and
were
close
to
him
before
he
perceived
us
he
respectfully
rose
as
we
drew
near
and
was
moving
away
when
i
begged
him
to
keep
his
seat
do
let
us
disturb
you
i
said
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
he
resumed
his
seat
with
somewhat
of
embarrassment
while
he
had
been
standing
i
had
observed
that
he
was
a
tall
man
and
though
slightly
bowed
by
the
weight
of
years
apparently
quite
vigorous
he
was
not
entirely
black
and
this
fact
together
with
the
quality
of
his
hair
which
was
about
six
inches
long
and
very
bushy
except
on
the
top
of
his
head
where
he
was
quite
bald
suggested
a
slight
strain
of
other
than
negro
blood
there
was
a
shrewdness
in
his
eyes
too
which
was
not
altogether
african
and
which
as
we
afterwards
learned
from
experience
was
indicative
of
a
corresponding
shrewdness
in
his
character
he
went
on
eating
the
grapes
but
did
not
seem
to
enjoy
himself
quite
so
well
as
he
had
apparently
done
before
he
became
aware
of
our
presence
do
you
live
around
here
i
asked
anxious
to
put
him
at
his
ease
yas
suh
i
lives
des
ober
yander
behine

lumberton

i
replied
but
i
do

that
i
shall
care
to

unless
i
can
be
reasonably
sure
of

is
goophered
is
what
i
asked
not
grasping
the
meaning
of
this
unfamiliar
word
is
goophered
cunju
bewitch
he
imparted
this
information
with
such
solemn
earnestness
and
with
such
an
air
of
confidential
mystery
that
i
felt
somewhat
interested
while
annie
was
evidently
much
impressed
and
drew
closer
to
me
how
do
you
know
it
is
bewitched
i
asked
i
wouldn
spec
fer
you
ter
me

restin
i
kin
to
you
how
it
all
happen
we
assured
him
that
we
would
be
glad
to
hear
how
it
all
happened
and
he
began
to
tell
us
at
first
the
current
of
his
memory
or
imagination
seemed
somewhat
sluggish
but
as
his
embarrassment
wore
off
his
language
flowed
more
freely
and
the
story
acquired
perspective
and
coherence
as
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
the
narrative
his
eyes
assumed
a
dreamy
expression
and
he
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
his
auditors
and
to
be
living
over
again
in
monologue
his
life
on
the
old
plantation
ole
mars

mcadoo
he
began
bought

en

sence
is
that
story
true
asked
annie
doubtfully
but
seriously
as
the
old
man
concluded
his
narrative
it
des
ez
true
ez
i
here
miss
dey
a
easy
way
ter
prove
it
i
kin
lead
de
way
right
ter
henry
grave
ober
yander
in
de
plantation
en
i
tell
yer
marster
i
would
n
you
to
buy
dis
yer
ole
vimya
de
goopher
on
it
yit
en
dey
ain
no
tellin
it
gwine
ter
crap
out
but
i
thought
you
said
all
the
old
vines
died
dey
did
ter
die
but
a
few
un
come
out
en
is
mixed
in
de
yuthers
i
ain
skeered
ter
eat
de
grapes
i
knows
de
old
vimes
fum
de
noo
ones
but
wid
strangers
dey
ain
no
tellin
mought
happen
i
would
n
yer
ter
buy
dis
vimya
i
bought
the
vineyard
nevertheless
and
it
has
been
for
a
long
time
in
a
thriving
condition
and
is
often
referred
to
by
the
local
press
as
a
striking
illustration
of
the
opportunities
open
to
northern
capital
in
the
development
of
southern
industries
the
luscious
scuppernong
holds
first
rank
among
our
grapes
though
we
cultivate
a
great
many
other
varieties
and
our
income
from
grapes
packed
and
shipped
to
the
northern
markets
is
quite
considerable
i
have
not
noticed
any
developments
of
the
goopher
in
the
vineyard
although
i
have
a
mild
suspicion
that
our
colored
assistants
do
not
suffer
from
want
of
grapes
during
the
season
i
found
when
i
bought
the
vineyard
that
uncle
julius
had
occupied
a
cabin
on
the
place
for
many
years
and
derived
a
respectable
revenue
from
the
product
of
the
neglected
grapevines
this
doubtless
accounted
for
his
advice
to
me
not
to
buy
the
vineyard
though
whether
it
inspired
the
goopher
story
i
am
unable
to
state
i
believe
however
that
the
wages
i
paid
him
for
his
services
as
coachman
for
i
gave
him
employment
in
that
capacity
were
more
than
an
equivalent
for
anything
he
lost
by
the
sale
of
the
vineyard
po
sandy
on
the
northeast
corner
of
my
vineyard
in
central
north
carolina
and
fronting
on
the
lumberton
there
stood
a
small
frame
house
of
the
simplest
construction
it
was
built
of
pine
lumber
and
contained
but
one
room
to
which
one
window
gave
light
and
one
door
admission
its
weatherbeaten
sides
revealed
a
virgin
innocence
of
paint
against
one
end
of
the
house
and
occupying
half
its
width
there
stood
a
huge
brick
chimney
the
crumbling
mortar
had
left
large
cracks
between
the
bricks
the
bricks
themselves
had
begun
to
scale
off
in
large
flakes
leaving
the
chimney
sprinkled
with
unsightly
blotches
these
evidences
of
decay
were
but
partially
concealed
by
a
creeping
vine
which
extended
its
slender
branches
hither
and
thither
in
an
ambitious
but
futile
attempt
to
cover
the
whole
chimney
the
wooden
shutter
which
had
once
protected
the
unglazed
window
had
fallen
from
its
hinges
and
lay
rotting
in
the
rank
grass
and
beneath
this
building
i
learned
when
i
bought
the
place
had
been
used
as
a
schoolhouse
for
several
years
prior
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
since
which
time
it
had
remained
unoccupied
save
when
some
stray
cow
or
vagrant
hog
had
sought
shelter
within
its
walls
from
the
chill
rains
and
nipping
winds
of
winter
one
day
my
wife
requested
me
to
build
her
a
new
kitchen
the
house
erected
by
us
when
we
first
came
to
live
upon
the
vineyard
contained
a
very
conveniently
arranged
kitchen
but
for
some
occult
reason
my
wife
wanted
a
kitchen
in
the
back
yard
apart
from
the
after
the
usual
southern
fashion
of
course
i
had
to
build
it
to
save
expense
i
decided
to
tear
down
the
old
schoolhouse
and
use
the
lumber
which
was
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
in
the
construction
of
the
new
kitchen
before
demolishing
the
old
house
however
i
made
an
estimate
of
the
amount
of
material
contained
in
it
and
found
that
i
would
have
to
buy
several
hundred
feet
of
lumber
additional
in
order
to
build
the
new
kitchen
according
to
my
wife
plan
one
morning
old
julius
mcadoo
our
colored
coachman
harnessed
the
gray
mare
to
the
rockaway
and
drove
my
wife
and
me
over
to
the
sawmill
from
which
i
meant
to
order
the
new
lumber
we
drove
down
the
long
lane
which
led
from
our
house
to
the
following
the
for
about
a
mile
we
turned
into
a
road
running
through
the
forest
and
across
the
swamp
to
the
sawmill
beyond
our
carriage
jolted
over
the
corduroy
road
which
traversed
the
swamp
and
then
climbed
the
long
hill
leading
to
the
sawmill
when
we
reached
the
mill
the
foreman
had
gone
over
to
a
neighboring
farmhouse
probably
to
smoke
or
gossip
and
we
were
compelled
to
await
his
return
before
we
could
transact
our
business
we
remained
seated
in
the
carriage
a
few
rods
from
the
mill
and
watched
the
leisurely
movements
of
the
we
had
not
waited
long
before
a
huge
pine
log
was
placed
in
position
the
machinery
of
the
mill
was
set
in
motion
and
the
circular
saw
began
to
eat
its
way
through
the
log
with
a
loud
whir
which
resounded
throughout
the
vicinity
of
the
mill
the
sound
rose
and
fell
in
a
sort
of
rhythmic
cadence
which
heard
from
where
we
sat
was
not
unpleasing
and
not
loud
enough
to
prevent
conversation
when
the
saw
started
on
its
second
journey
through
the
log
julius
observed
in
a
lugubrious
tone
and
with
a
perceptible
shudder
ugh
but
dat
des
do
cuddle
my
blood
what
the
matter
uncle
julius
inquired
my
wife
who
is
of
a
very
sympathetic
turn
of
mind
does
the
noise
affect
your
nerves
no
mis
annie
replied
the
old
man
with
emotion
i
ain
narvous
but
dat
saw
en
grindin
thoo
dat
stick
er
timber
en
moanin
en
groanin
en
sweekin
kyars
my
back
ter
ole
times
en
me
er
po
sandy
the
pathetic
intonation
with
which
he
lengthened
out
the
po
sandy
touched
a
responsive
chord
in
our
own
hearts
and
who
was
poor
sandy
asked
my
wife
who
takes
a
deep
interest
in
the
stories
of
plantation
life
which
she
hears
from
the
lips
of
the
older
colored
people
some
of
these
stories
are
quaintly
humorous
others
wildly
extravagant
revealing
the
oriental
cast
of
the
imagination
while
others
poured
freely
into
the
sympathetic
ear
of
a
woman
disclose
many
a
tragic
incident
of
the
darker
side
of
slavery

inter

annie
had
listened
to
this
gruesome
narrative
with
strained
attention
what
a
system
it
was
she
exclaimed
when
julius
had
finished
under
which
such
things
were
possible
what
things
i
asked
in
amazement
are
you
seriously
considering
the
possibility
of
a
man
being
turned
into
a
tree
oh
no
she
replied
quickly
not
that
and
then
she
murmured
absently
and
with
a
dim
look
in
her
fine
eyes
poor
tenie
we
ordered
the
lumber
and
returned
home
that
night
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
and
my
wife
had
to
all
appearances
been
sound
asleep
for
half
an
hour
she
startled
me
out
of
an
incipient
doze
by
exclaiming
suddenly
john
i
do
believe
i
want
my
new
kitchen
built
out
of
the
lumber
in
that
old
schoolhouse
you
would
for
a
moment
allow
yourself
i
replied
with
some
asperity
to
be
influenced
by
that
absurdly
impossible
yarn
which
julius
was
spinning
i
know
the
story
is
absurd
she
replied
dreamily
and
i
am
not
so
silly
as
to
believe
it
but
i
do
think
i
should
ever
be
able
to
take
any
pleasure
in
that
kitchen
if
it
were
built
out
of
that
lumber
besides
i
think
the
kitchen
would
look
better
and
last
longer
if
the
lumber
were
all
new
of
course
she
had
her
way
i
bought
the
new
lumber
though
not
without
grumbling
a
week
or
two
later
i
was
called
away
from
home
on
business
on
my
return
after
an
absence
of
several
days
my
wife
remarked
to
me
john
there
has
been
a
split
in
the
sandy
run
colored
baptist
church
on
the
temperance
question
about
half
the
members
have
come
out
from
the
main
body
and
set
up
for
themselves
uncle
julius
is
one
of
the
seceders
and
he
came
to
me
yesterday
and
asked
if
they
might
not
hold
their
meetings
in
the
old
schoolhouse
for
the
present
i
hope
you
did
let
the
old
rascal
have
it
i
returned
with
some
warmth
i
had
just
received
a
bill
for
the
new
lumber
i
had
bought
well
she
replied
i
could
refuse
him
the
use
of
the
house
for
so
good
a
purpose
and
i
venture
to
say
i
continued
that
you
subscribed
something
toward
the
support
of
the
new
church
she
did
not
attempt
to
deny
it
what
are
they
going
to
do
about
the
ghost
i
asked
somewhat
curious
to
know
how
julius
would
get
around
this
obstacle
oh
replied
annie
uncle
julius
says
that
ghosts
never
disturb
religious
worship
but
that
if
sandy
spirit
happen
to
stray
into
meeting
by
mistake
no
doubt
the
preaching
would
do
it
good
mars
jeems
nightmare
we
found
old
julius
very
useful
when
we
moved
to
our
new
residence
he
had
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
neighborhood
was
familiar
with
the
roads
and
the
watercourses
knew
the
qualities
of
the
various
soils
and
what
they
would
produce
and
where
the
best
hunting
and
fishing
were
to
be
had
he
was
a
marvelous
hand
in
the
management
of
horses
and
dogs
with
whose
mental
processes
he
manifested
a
greater
familiarity
than
mere
use
would
seem
to
account
for
though
it
was
doubtless
due
to
the
simplicity
of
a
life
that
had
kept
him
close
to
nature
toward
my
tract
of
land
and
the
things
that
were
on
it
the
creeks
the
swamps
the
hills
the
meadows
the
stones
the
trees
he
maintained
a
peculiar
personal
attitude
that
might
be
called
predial
rather
than
proprietary
he
had
been
accustomed
until
long
after
middle
life
to
look
upon
himself
as
the
property
of
another
when
this
relation
was
no
longer
possible
owing
to
the
war
and
to
his
master
death
and
the
dispersion
of
the
family
he
had
been
unable
to
break
off
entirely
the
mental
habits
of
a
lifetime
but
had
attached
himself
to
the
old
plantation
of
which
he
seemed
to
consider
himself
an
appurtenance
we
found
him
useful
in
many
ways
and
entertaining
in
others
and
my
wife
and
i
took
quite
a
fancy
to
him
shortly
after
we
became
established
in
our
home
on
the
julius
brought
up
to
the
house
one
day
a
colored
boy
of
about
seventeen
whom
he
introduced
as
his
grandson
and
for
whom
he
solicited
employment
i
was
not
favorably
impressed
by
the
appearance
quite
the
contrary
in
fact
but
mainly
to
please
the
old
man
i
hired
tom
his
name
was
tom
to
help
about
the
stables
weed
the
garden
cut
wood
and
bring
water
and
in
general
to
make
himself
useful
about
the
outdoor
work
of
the
household
my
first
impression
of
tom
proved
to
be
correct
he
turned
out
to
be
very
trifling
and
i
was
much
annoyed
by
his
laziness
his
carelessness
and
his
apparent
lack
of
any
sense
of
responsibility
i
kept
him
longer
than
i
should
on
julius
account
hoping
that
he
might
improve
but
he
seemed
to
grow
worse
instead
of
better
and
when
i
finally
reached
the
limit
of
my
patience
i
discharged
him
i
am
sorry
julius
i
said
to
the
old
man
i
should
have
liked
to
oblige
you
by
keeping
him
but
i
ca
stand
tom
any
longer
he
is
absolutely
untrustworthy
yas
suh
replied
julius
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
long
shake
of
the
head
i
knows
he
ain
much
account
en
dey
ain
much
ter
be
put
on
but
i
wuz
hopin
dat
you
mought
make
some
fuh
young
nigger
suh
en
gib
one
mo
chance
but
i
had
hardened
my
heart
i
had
always
been
too
easily
imposed
upon
and
had
suffered
too
much
from
this
weakness
i
determined
to
be
firm
as
a
rock
in
this
instance
no
julius
i
rejoined
decidedly
it
is
impossible
i
gave
him
more
than
a
fair
trial
and
he
simply
wo
do
when
my
wife
and
i
set
out
for
our
drive
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
afternoon
is
evening
in
southern
parlance
one
of
the
servants
put
into
the
two
large
earthenware
jugs
our
drive
was
to
be
down
through
the
swamp
to
the
mineral
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
beyond
the
water
of
this
spring
was
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
and
iron
and
while
not
particularly
agreeable
of
smell
or
taste
was
used
by
us
in
moderation
for
sanitary
reasons
when
we
reached
the
spring
we
found
a
man
engaged
in
cleaning
it
out
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
he
said
that
if
we
would
wait
five
or
ten
minutes
his
task
would
be
finished
and
the
spring
in
such
condition
that
we
could
fill
our
jugs
we
might
have
driven
on
and
come
back
by
way
of
the
spring
but
there
was
a
bad
stretch
of
road
beyond
and
we
concluded
to
remain
where
we
were
until
the
spring
should
be
ready
we
were
in
a
cool
and
shady
place
it
was
often
necessary
to
wait
awhile
in
north
carolina
and
our
northern
energy
had
not
been
entirely
proof
against
the
influences
of
climate
and
local
custom
while
we
sat
there
a
man
came
suddenly
around
a
turn
of
the
road
ahead
of
us
i
recognized
in
him
a
neighbor
with
whom
i
had
exchanged
formal
calls
he
was
driving
a
horse
apparently
a
creature
possessing
so
far
as
i
could
see
at
a
glance
the
marks
of
good
temper
and
good
breeding
the
gentleman
i
had
heard
it
suggested
was
slightly
deficient
in
both
the
horse
was
rearing
and
plunging
and
the
man
was
beating
him
furiously
with
a
when
he
saw
us
he
flushed
a
fiery
red
and
as
he
passed
held
the
reins
with
one
hand
at
some
risk
to
his
safety
lifted
his
hat
and
bowed
somewhat
constrainedly
as
the
horse
darted
by
us
still
panting
and
snorting
with
fear
he
looks
as
though
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
i
observed
i
sure
he
ought
to
be
exclaimed
my
wife
indignantly
i
think
there
is
no
worse
sin
and
no
more
disgraceful
thing
than
cruelty
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
assented
a
man
his
hoss

gwine
ter

on

what
was
it
about

julius
i
asked
the
man
had
not
yet
finished
cleaning
the
spring
and
we
might
as
well
put
in
time
listening
to
julius
as
in
any
other
way
we
had
found
some
of
his
plantation
tales
quite
interesting

concluded
julius
sententiously
as
the
man
came
up
and
announced
that
the
spring
was
ready
for
us
to
get
water
dat

that
is
a
very
strange
story
uncle
julius
observed
my
wife
smiling
and
solomon
explanation
is
quite
improbable
yes
julius
said
i
that
was
powerful
goopher
i
am
glad
too
that
you
told
us
the
moral
of
the
story
it
might
have
escaped
us
otherwise
by
the
way
did
you
make
that
up
all
by
yourself
the
old
man
face
assumed
an
injured
look
expressive
more
of
sorrow
than
of
anger
and
shaking
his
head
he
replied
no
suh
i
heared
dat
tale
befo
you
er
mis
annie
dere
wuz
bawn
suh
my
mammy
tol
me
dat
tale
i
mo
ter
a
i
drove
to
town
next
morning
on
some
business
and
did
not
return
until
noon
and
after
dinner
i
had
to
visit
a
neighbor
and
did
not
get
back
until
i
was
smoking
a
cigar
on
the
back
piazza
in
the
early
evening
when
i
saw
a
familiar
figure
carrying
a
bucket
of
water
to
the
barn
i
called
my
wife
my
dear
i
said
severely
what
is
that
rascal
doing
here
i
thought
i
discharged
him
yesterday
for
good
and
all
oh
yes
she
answered
i
forgot
to
tell
you
he
was
hanging
round
the
place
all
the
morning
and
looking
so
down
in
the
mouth
that
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
try
to
do
better
we
would
give
him
one
more
chance
he
seems
so
grateful
and
so
really
in
earnest
in
his
promises
of
amendment
that
i
sure
you
not
regret
taking
him
back
i
was
seriously
enough
annoyed
to
let
my
cigar
go
out
i
did
not
share
my
wife
hopes
in
regard
to
tom
but
as
i
did
not
wish
the
servants
to
think
there
was
any
conflict
of
authority
in
the
household
i
let
the
boy
stay
the
conjurer
revenge
sunday
was
sometimes
a
rather
dull
day
at
our
place
in
the
morning
when
the
weather
was
pleasant
my
wife
and
i
would
drive
to
town
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
to
attend
the
church
of
our
choice
the
afternoons
we
spent
at
home
for
the
most
part
occupying
ourselves
with
the
newspapers
and
magazines
and
the
contents
of
a
fairly
good
library
we
had
a
piano
in
the
house
on
which
my
wife
played
with
skill
and
feeling
i
possessed
a
passable
baritone
voice
and
could
accompany
myself
indifferently
well
when
my
wife
was
not
by
to
assist
me
when
these
resources
failed
us
we
were
apt
to
find
it
a
little
dull
one
sunday
afternoon
in
early
spring
the
balmy
spring
of
north
carolina
when
the
air
is
in
that
ideal
balance
between
heat
and
cold
where
one
wishes
it
could
always
remain
my
wife
and
i
were
seated
on
the
front
piazza
she
wearily
but
conscientiously
ploughing
through
a
missionary
report
while
i
followed
the
impossible
career
of
the
blonde
heroine
of
a
rudimentary
novel
i
had
thrown
the
book
aside
in
disgust
when
i
saw
julius
coming
through
the
yard
under
the
spreading
elms
which
were
already
in
full
leaf
he
wore
his
sunday
clothes
and
advanced
with
a
dignity
of
movement
quite
different
from
his
slouch
have
a
seat
julius
i
said
pointing
to
an
empty
no
thanky
boss
i
des
set
here
on
de
top
step
oh
no
uncle
julius
exclaimed
annie
take
this
chair
you
will
find
it
much
more
comfortable
the
old
man
grinned
in
appreciation
of
her
solicitude
and
seated
himself
somewhat
awkwardly
julius
i
remarked
i
am
thinking
of
setting
out
scuppernong
vines
on
that
where
the
three
are
and
while
working
there
i
think
i
plant
watermelons
between
the
vines
and
get
a
little
something
to
pay
for
my
first
year
work
the
new
railroad
will
be
finished
by
the
middle
of
summer
and
i
can
ship
the
melons
north
and
get
a
good
price
for
them
ef
you
er
gwine
ter
hab
any
mo
ploughin
ter
do
replied
julius
i
you
ha
ter
buy
ernudder
creetur
hit
much
ez
dem
hosses
kin
do
ter
ter
de
wuk
dey
got
now
yes
i
had
thought
of
that
i
think
i
get
a
mule
a
mule
can
do
more
work
and
does
require
as
much
attention
as
a
horse
i
would
n
you
ter
buy
no
mule
remarked
julius
with
a
shake
of
his
head
why
not
well
you
may
hit
all
but
ef
i
wuz
in
yo
place
i
would
n
buy
no
mule
but
that
is
a
reason
what
objection
have
you
to
a
mule
fac
is
continued
the
old
man
in
a
serious
tone
i
doan
lack
ter
dribe
a
mule
i
alluz
afeared
i
mought
be
imposin
on
some
human
creetur
time
i
cuts
a
mule
wid
a
ter
me
lackly
i
cuttin
some
er
my
own
relations
er
somebody
what
put
such
an
absurd
idea
into
your
head
i
asked
my
question
was
followed
by
a
short
silence
during
which
julius
seemed
engaged
in
a
mental
struggle
i
dunno
ez
hit
wuf
ter
tell
you
dis
he
said
at
length
i
doan
fer
you
ter
it
does
you
dat
man
hilt
de
hoss
fer
you
de
yuther
day
you
was
gittin
de
rockaway
down
ter
mars
archie
mcmillan
sto
yes
i
believe
i
do
remember
seeing
a
man
there
did
you
eber
see
a
nigger
befo
er
sence
no
i
ca
remember
that
i
ever
saw
a
colored
man
i
replied
after
a
moment
reflection
you
en
mis
annie
would
n
wanter
me
ef
i
wuz
ter
dat
dat
man
was
oncet
a
mule
no
i
replied
i
do
think
it
very
likely
that
you
could
make
us
believe
it
why
uncle
julius
said
annie
severely
what
ridiculous
nonsense
this
reception
of
the
old
man
statement
reduced
him
to
silence
and
it
required
some
diplomacy
on
my
part
to
induce
him
to
vouchsafe
an
explanation
the
prospect
of
a
long
dull
afternoon
was
not
alluring
and
i
was
glad
to
have
the
monotony
of
sabbath
quiet
relieved
by
a
plantation
legend
i
wuz
a
young
man
began
julius
when
i
had
finally
prevailed
upon
him
to
tell
us

dey
dey
marster
must
had
his
dat
cunjuh
man
my
wife
had
listened
to
julius
recital
with
only
a
mild
interest
when
the
old
man
had
finished
it
she
remarked
that
story
does
not
appeal
to
me
uncle
julius
and
is
not
up
to
your
usual
mark
it
is
pathetic
it
has
no
moral
that
i
can
discover
and
i
ca
see
why
you
should
tell
it
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
like
nonsense
the
old
man
looked
puzzled
as
well
as
pained
he
had
not
pleased
the
lady
and
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
why
i
sorry
ma
he
said
reproachfully
ef
you
doan
lack
dat
tale
i
ca
make
out
you
means
by
some
er
dem
you
uses
but
tellin
nuffin
but
de
truf
i
did
n
see
de
cunjuh
man
back
fer
i
wuz
n
dere
but
i
hearin
de
tale
fer
yeahs
en
i
ain
got
no
fer
ter
it
dey
so
many
things
a
body
knows
is
lies
dat
dey
ain
no
use

roun
findin

wid
tales
dat
mought
des
ez

so
ez
not
f

dey
a
young
nigger
gwine
ter
school
in
town
en
he
come
out
heah
de
yuther
day
en
dat
de
sun
stood
still
en
de
yeath
turnt
roun
day
on
a
kinder
axletree
i
tol
dat
young
nigger
ef
he
didn
take
wid
dem
lies
i
take
a
ter
fer
i

de
yeath

all
de
time
en
i

de

dis

is
de
way
he
goes
on
ef
anybody
ax
him
how
he
come
by
dat
i
axed
one
day
mighty
perlite
en
civil
en
he
call
me
a
ole
fool
en
got
so
mad
he
ain
spoke
ter
me
sence
quare
but
dis
is
a
quare
worl
anyway
yer
kin
fix
it
concluded
the
old
man
with
a
weary
sigh
ef
you
makes
up
yo
min
not
ter
buy
dat
mule
suh
he
added
as
he
rose
to
go
i
knows
a
man
got
a
good
hoss
he
wants
ter
sell
dat
i
heared
i
gwine
ter
en
i
gwine
right
by
de
man
house
en
ef
you
lack
ter
look
at
de
hoss
i
ax
ter
fetch
him
roun
oh
yes
i
said
you
can
ask
him
to
stop
in
if
he
is
passing
there
will
be
no
harm
in
looking
at
the
horse
though
i
rather
think
i
shall
buy
a
mule
early
next
morning
the
man
brought
the
horse
up
to
the
vineyard
at
that
time
i
was
not
a
very
good
judge
of
horseflesh
the
horse
appeared
sound
and
gentle
and
as
the
owner
assured
me
had
no
bad
habits
the
man
wanted
a
large
price
for
the
horse
but
finally
agreed
to
accept
a
much
smaller
sum
upon
payment
of
which
i
became
possessed
of
a
very
animal
but
alas
for
the
deceitfulness
of
appearances
i
soon
ascertained
that
the
horse
was
blind
in
one
eye
and
that
the
sight
of
the
other
was
very
defective
and
not
a
month
elapsed
before
my
purchase
developed
most
of
the
diseases
that
is
heir
to
and
a
more
worthless
spavined
quadruped
never
disgraced
the
noble
name
of
horse
after
worrying
through
two
or
three
months
of
life
he
expired
one
night
in
a
fit
of
the
colic
i
replaced
him
with
a
mule
and
julius
henceforth
had
to
take
his
chances
of
driving
some
metamorphosed
unfortunate
circumstances
that
afterwards
came
to
my
knowledge
created
in
my
mind
a
strong
suspicion
that
julius
may
have
played
a
more
than
unconscious
part
in
this
transaction
among
other
significant
facts
was
his
appearance
the
sunday
following
the
purchase
of
the
horse
in
a
new
suit
of
store
clothes
which
i
had
seen
displayed
in
the
window
of
solomon
cohen
store
on
my
last
visit
to
town
and
had
remarked
on
account
of
their
striking
originality
of
cut
and
pattern
as
i
had
not
recently
paid
julius
any
money
and
as
he
had
no
property
to
mortgage
i
was
driven
to
conjecture
to
account
for
his
possession
of
the
means
to
buy
the
clothes
of
course
i
would
not
charge
him
with
duplicity
unless
i
could
prove
it
at
least
to
a
moral
certainty
but
for
a
long
time
afterwards
i
took
his
advice
only
in
small
doses
and
with
great
discrimination
sis
becky
pickaninny
we
had
not
lived
in
north
carolina
very
long
before
i
was
able
to
note
a
marked
improvement
in
my
wife
health
the
air
of
the
surrounding
piney
woods
the
mild
and
equable
climate
the
peaceful
leisure
of
country
life
had
brought
about
in
hopeful
measure
the
cure
we
had
anticipated
toward
the
end
of
our
second
year
however
her
ailment
took
an
unexpected
turn
for
the
worse
she
became
the
victim
of
a
settled
melancholy
attended
with
vague
forebodings
of
impending
misfortune
you
must
keep
up
her
spirits
said
our
physician
the
best
in
the
neighboring
town
this
melancholy
lowers
her
tone
too
much
tends
to
lessen
her
strength
and
if
it
continue
too
long
may
be
fraught
with
grave
consequences
i
tried
various
expedients
to
cheer
her
up
i
read
novels
to
her
i
had
the
hands
on
the
place
come
up
in
the
evening
and
serenade
her
with
plantation
songs
friends
came
in
sometimes
and
talked
and
frequent
letters
from
the
north
kept
her
in
touch
with
her
former
home
but
nothing
seemed
to
rouse
her
from
the
depression
into
which
she
had
fallen
one
pleasant
afternoon
in
spring
i
placed
an
armchair
in
a
shaded
portion
of
the
front
piazza
and
filling
it
with
pillows
led
my
wife
out
of
the
house
and
seated
her
where
she
would
have
the
pleasantest
view
of
a
somewhat
monotonous
scenery
she
was
scarcely
placed
when
old
julius
came
through
the
yard
and
taking
off
his
tattered
straw
hat
inquired
somewhat
anxiously
how
is
you
feelin
dis
atternoon
ma
she
is
not
very
cheerful
julius
i
said
my
wife
was
apparently
without
energy
enough
to
speak
for
herself
the
old
man
did
not
seem
inclined
to
go
away
so
i
asked
him
to
sit
down
i
had
noticed
as
he
came
up
that
he
held
some
small
object
in
his
hand
when
he
had
taken
his
seat
on
the
top
step
he
kept
fingering
this
object
what
it
was
i
could
not
quite
make
out
what
is
that
you
have
there
julius
i
asked
with
mild
curiosity
dis
is
my
rabbit
foot
suh
this
was
at
a
time
before
this
curious
superstition
had
attained
its
present
jocular
popularity
among
white
people
and
while
i
had
heard
of
it
before
it
had
not
yet
outgrown
the
charm
of
novelty
what
do
you
do
with
it
i
kyars
it
wid
me
fer
luck
suh
julius
i
observed
half
to
him
and
half
to
my
wife
your
people
will
never
rise
in
the
world
until
they
throw
off
these
childish
superstitions
and
learn
to
live
by
the
light
of
reason
and
common
sense
how
absurd
to
imagine
that
the
of
a
poor
dead
rabbit
with
which
he
timorously
felt
his
way
along
through
a
life
surrounded
by
snares
and
pitfalls
beset
by
enemies
on
every
hand
can
promote
happiness
or
success
or
ward
off
failure
or
misfortune
it
is
ridiculous
assented
my
wife
with
faint
interest
dat
i
tells
dese
niggers
roun
heah
said
julius
de
ain
got
no
power
it
has
ter
be
de
suh
de
lef
er
a
rabbit
killt
by
a
nigger
on
a
night
in
de
full
er
de
moon
they
must
be
very
rare
and
valuable
i
said
dey
is
kinder
suh
en
dey
ain
no
er
money
could
buy
mine
suh
i
mought
len
it
ter
anybody
i
sot
sto
by
but
i
would
sell
it
no
indeed
suh
i
would
n
how
do
you
know
it
brings
good
luck
i
asked
i
ain
had
no
bad
luck
sence
i
had
it
suh
en
i
had
dis
rabbit
foot
fer

i

en
i
sol
erway
en
i
wuz
sot
free
en
dat
all
good

but
that
does
prove
anything
i
rejoined
many
other
people
have
gone
through
a
similar
experience
and
probably
more
than
one
of
them
had
no
rabbit
foot
law
suh
you
doan
hafter
prove
de
rabbit
foot
knows
dat
roun
heah
knows
it
but
ef
it
has
ter
be
prove
ter

my
wife
had
listened
to
this
story
with
greater
interest
than
she
had
manifested
in
any
subject
for
several
days
i
had
watched
her
furtively
from
time
to
time
during
the
recital
and
had
observed
the
play
of
her
countenance
it
had
expressed
in
turn
sympathy
indignation
pity
and
at
the
end
lively
satisfaction
that
is
a
very
ingenious
fairy
tale
julius
i
said
and
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
why
john
said
my
wife
severely
the
story
bears
the
stamp
of
truth
if
ever
a
story
did
yes
i
replied
especially
the
episode
and
the
digression
to
say
nothing
of
the
doings
of
the
hornet
and
the
sparrow
oh
well
i
do
care
she
rejoined
with
delightful
animation
those
are
mere
ornamental
details
and
not
at
all
essential
the
story
is
true
to
nature
and
might
have
happened
half
a
hundred
times
and
no
doubt
did
happen
in
those
horrid
days
before
the
war
by
the
way
julius
i
remarked
your
story
does
establish
what
you
started
out
to
prove
that
a
rabbit
foot
brings
good
luck
hit
plain
ter
me
suh
replied
julius
i
bet
young
missis
dere
kin
it
i
rather
suspect
replied
my
wife
promptly
that
sis
becky
had
no
rabbit
foot
you
is
hit
de
de
fus
fire
ma
assented
julius
ef
becky
had
had
a
rabbit
foot
she
nebber
would
went
all
dis
trouble
i
went
into
the
house
for
some
purpose
and
left
julius
talking
to
my
wife
when
i
came
back
a
moment
later
he
was
gone
my
wife
condition
took
a
turn
for
the
better
from
this
very
day
and
she
was
soon
on
the
way
to
ultimate
recovery
several
weeks
later
after
she
had
resumed
her
afternoon
drives
which
had
been
interrupted
by
her
illness
julius
brought
the
rockaway
round
to
the
front
door
one
day
and
i
assisted
my
wife
into
the
carriage
john
she
said
before
i
had
taken
my
seat
i
wish
you
would
look
in
my
room
and
bring
me
my
handkerchief
you
will
find
it
in
the
pocket
of
my
blue
dress
i
went
to
execute
the
commission
when
i
pulled
the
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
something
else
came
with
it
and
fell
on
the
floor
i
picked
up
the
object
and
looked
at
it
it
was
julius
rabbit
foot
the
gray
wolfs
it
was
a
rainy
day
at
the
vineyard
the
morning
had
dawned
bright
and
clear
but
the
sky
had
soon
clouded
and
by
nine
there
was
a
light
shower
followed
by
others
at
brief
intervals
by
noon
the
rain
had
settled
into
a
dull
steady
downpour
the
clouds
hung
low
and
seemed
to
grow
denser
instead
of
lighter
as
they
discharged
their
watery
burden
and
there
was
now
and
then
a
muttering
of
distant
thunder
outdoor
work
was
suspended
and
i
spent
most
of
the
day
at
the
house
looking
over
my
accounts
and
bringing
up
some
arrears
of
correspondence
towards
four
i
went
out
on
the
piazza
which
was
broad
and
dry
and
less
gloomy
than
the
interior
of
the
house
and
composed
myself
for
a
quiet
smoke
i
had
lit
my
cigar
and
opened
the
volume
i
was
reading
at
that
time
when
my
wife
whom
i
had
left
dozing
on
a
lounge
came
out
and
took
a
near
me
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
or
read
to
me
or
something
she
exclaimed
petulantly
it
awfully
dull
here
today
i
read
to
you
with
pleasure
i
replied
and
began
at
the
point
where
i
had
found
my
bookmark
difficulty
of
dealing
with
transformations
so
as
those
which
all
existences
have
undergone
or
are
undergoing
is
such
as
to
make
a
complete
and
deductive
interpretation
almost
hopeless
so
to
grasp
the
total
process
of
redistribution
of
matter
and
motion
as
to
see
simultaneously
its
several
necessary
results
in
their
actual
interdependence
is
scarcely
possible
there
is
however
a
mode
of
rendering
the
process
as
a
whole
tolerably
comprehensible
though
the
genesis
of
the
rearrangement
of
every
evolving
aggregate
is
in
itself
one
it
presents
to
our
intelligence
john
interrupted
my
wife
i
wish
you
would
stop
reading
that
nonsense
and
see
who
that
is
coming
up
the
lane
i
closed
my
book
with
a
sigh
i
had
never
been
able
to
interest
my
wife
in
the
study
of
philosophy
even
when
presented
in
the
simplest
and
most
lucid
form
some
one
was
coming
up
the
lane
at
least
a
huge
faded
cotton
umbrella
was
making
progress
toward
the
house
and
beneath
it
a
pair
of
nether
extremities
in
trousers
was
discernible
any
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
whose
they
were
was
soon
resolved
when
julius
reached
the
steps
and
putting
the
umbrella
down
got
a
good
dash
of
the
rain
as
he
stepped
up
on
the
porch
why
in
the
world
julius
i
asked
did
you
keep
the
umbrella
up
until
you
got
under
cover
it
bad
luck
suh

julius
i
responded
we
do
want
to
go
driving
of
course
in
the
rain
but
i
should
like
to
consult
you
about
another
matter
i
thinking
of
taking
in
a
piece
of
new
ground
what
do
you
imagine
it
would
cost
to
have
that
neck
of
woods
down
by
the
swamp

the
old

assumed
an
expression
of
unwonted
seriousness

doubtfully

my
wife
demanded
with
growing
interest
de
gray
wolf
some
folks
calls
it
but
i
knows
better
tell
us
about
it
uncle
julius
said
my
wife
a
story
will
be
a
godsend
it
was
not
difficult
to
induce
the
old
man
to
tell
a
story
if
he
were
in
a
reminiscent
mood
of
tales
of
the
old
slavery
days
he
seemed
indeed
to
possess
an
exhaustless
store
some
weirdly
grotesque
some
broadly
humorous
some
bearing
the
stamp
of
truth
faint
perhaps
but
still
discernible
others
palpable
inventions
whether
his
own
or
not
we
never
knew
though
his
fancy
doubtless
embellished
them
but
even
the
wildest
was
not
without
an
element
of
pathos
the
tragedy
it
might
be
of
the
story
itself
the
shadow
never
absent
of
slavery
and
of
ignorance
the
sadness
always
of
life
as
seen
by
the
fading
light
of
an
old
memory

grave
or
perhaps
a
few
bones
of
some
denizen
of
the
forest
i
can
not
say
of
course
that
some
one
had
not
been
buried
there
but
if
so
the
hand
of
time
had
long
since
removed
any
evidence
of
the
fact
if
some
lone
wolf
the
last
of
his
pack
had
once
made
his
den
there
his
bones
had
long
since
crumbled
into
dust
and
gone
to
fertilize
the
rank
vegetation
that
formed
the
undergrowth
of
this
wild
spot
i
did
find
however
a
in
the
woods
with
an
ample
cavity
in
its
trunk
and
an
opening
through
which
convenient
access
could
be
had
to
the
stores
of
honey
within
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
ever
since
i
had
bought
the
place
and
for
many
years
before
julius
had
been
getting
honey
from
this
tree
the
gray
haunt
had
doubtless
proved
useful
in
keeping
off
too
inquisitive
people
who
might
have
interfered
with
his
monopoly
hannibal
i
hate
you
and
despise
you
i
wish
never
to
see
you
or
speak
to
you
again
very
well
i
will
take
care
that
henceforth
you
have
no
opportunity
to
do
either
these
words
the
first
in
the
passionately
vibrant
tones
of
my
and
the
latter
in
the
deeper
and
more
restrained
accents
of
an
angry
man
startled
me
from
my
nap
i
had
been
dozing
in
my
hammock
on
the
front
piazza
behind
the
honeysuckle
vine
i
had
been
faintly
aware
of
a
buzz
of
conversation
in
the
parlor
but
had
not
at
all
awakened
to
its
import
until
these
sentences
fell
or
i
might
rather
say
were
hurled
upon
my
ear
i
presume
the
young
people
had
either
not
seen
me
lying
there
the
venetian
blinds
opening
from
the
parlor
windows
upon
the
piazza
were
partly
closed
on
account
of
the
heat
or
else
in
their
excitement
they
had
forgotten
my
proximity
i
felt
somewhat
concerned
the
young
man
i
had
remarked
was
proud
firm
jealous
of
the
point
of
honor
and
from
my
observation
of
him
quite
likely
to
resent
to
the
bitter
end
what
he
deemed
a
slight
or
an
injustice
the
girl
i
knew
was
quite
as
as
young
murchison
i
feared
she
was
not
so
just
and
hoped
she
would
prove
more
yielding
i
knew
that
her
affections
were
strong
and
enduring
but
that
her
temperament
was
capricious
and
her
sunniest
moods
easily
overcast
by
some
small
cloud
of
jealousy
or
pique
i
had
never
imagined
however
that
she
was
capable
of
such
intensity
as
was
revealed
by
these
few
words
of
hers
as
i
say
i
felt
concerned
i
had
learned
to
like
malcolm
murchison
and
had
heartily
consented
to
his
marriage
with
my
ward
for
it
was
in
that
capacity
that
i
had
stood
for
a
year
or
two
to
my
wife
younger
sister
mabel
the
match
thus
rudely
broken
off
had
promised
to
be
another
link
binding
me
to
the
kindly
southern
people
among
whom
i
had
not
long
before
taken
up
my
residence
young
murchison
came
out
of
the
door
cleared
the
piazza
in
two
strides
without
seeming
aware
of
my
presence
and
went
off
down
the
lane
at
a
furious
pace
a
few
moments
later
mabel
began
playing
the
piano
loudly
with
a
touch
that
indicated
anger
and
pride
and
independence
and
a
dash
of
exultation
as
though
she
were
really
glad
that
she
had
driven
away
forever
the
young
man
whom
the
day
before
she
had
loved
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
first
passion
i
hoped
that
time
might
heal
the
breach
and
bring
the
two
young
people
together
again
i
told
my
wife
what
i
had
overheard
in
return
she
gave
me
mabel
version
of
the
affair
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
ever
be
settled
my
wife
said
it
is
something
more
than
a
mere
lovers
quarrel
it
began
it
is
true
because
she
found
fault
with
him
for
going
to
church
with
that
hateful
branson
girl
but
before
it
ended
there
were
things
said
that
no
woman
of
any
spirit
could
stand
i
am
afraid
it
is
all
over
between
them
i
was
sorry
to
hear
this
in
spite
of
the
very
firm
attitude
taken
by
my
wife
and
her
sister
i
still
hoped
that
the
quarrel
would
be
made
up
within
a
day
or
two
nevertheless
when
a
week
had
passed
with
no
word
from
young
murchison
and
with
no
sign
of
relenting
on
mabel
part
i
began
to
think
myself
mistaken
one
pleasant
afternoon
about
ten
days
after
the
rupture
old
julius
drove
the
rockaway
up
to
the
piazza
and
my
wife
mabel
and
i
took
our
seats
for
a
drive
to
a
neighbor
vineyard
over
on
the
lumberton
which
way
shall
we
go
i
asked
the
short
road
or
the
long
one
i
guess
we
had
better
take
the
short
road
answered
my
wife
we
will
get
there
sooner
it
a
mighty
fine
dribe
roun
by
de
big
road
mis
annie
observed
julius
en
it
doan
take
much
longer
to
git
dere
no
said
my
wife
i
think
we
will
go
by
the
short
road
there
is
a
in
blossom
near
the
mineral
spring
and
i
wish
to
get
some
of
the
flowers
i
you
fin
some
de
big
road
ma
suggested
julius
but
i
know
about
the
flowers
on
the
short
road
and
they
are
the
ones
i
want
we
drove
down
the
lane
to
the
highway
and
soon
struck
into
the
short
road
leading
past
the
mineral
spring
our
route
lay
partly
through
a
swamp
and
on
each
side
the
dark
umbrageous
foliage
unbroken
by
any
clearing
lent
to
the
road
solemnity
and
to
the
air
a
refreshing
coolness
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
and
about
to
the
mineral
spring
we
stopped
at
the
tree
of
which
my
wife
had
spoken
and
reaching
up
to
the
boughs
i
gathered
a
dozen
of
the
fragrant
white
flowers
when
i
resumed
my
seat
in
the
rockaway
julius
started
the
mare
she
went
on
for
a
few
rods
until
we
had
reached
the
edge
of
a
branch
crossing
the
road
when
she
stopped
short
why
did
you
stop
julius
i
asked
i
did
n
suh
he
replied
wuz
de
mare
stop
g
dere
lucy
wat
you
mean
by
dis
julius
jerked
the
reins
and
applied
the
whip
lightly
but
the
mare
did
not
stir
perhaps
you
had
better
get
down
and
lead
her
i
suggested
if
you
get
her
started
you
can
cross
on
the
log
and
keep
your
feet
dry
julius
alighted
took
hold
of
the
bridle
and
vainly
essayed
to
make
the
mare
move
she
planted
her
feet
with
even
more
evident
obstinacy
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
this
i
said
i
have
never
known
her
to
balk
before
have
you
julius
no
suh
replied
the
old
man
i
neber
has
it
a
thing
ter
me
suh
what
the
best
way
to
make
her
go
i
suh
dat
ef
i
her
she

udder
way
but
we
want
her
to
go
this
way
well
suh
i
ef
we
des
set
heah
fo
er
fibe
minutes
up
by
all
right
i
rejoined
it
is
cooler
here
than
any
place
i
have
struck
today
we
let
her
stand
for
a
while
and
see
what
she
does
we
had
sat
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
when
julius
suddenly
ejaculated
uh
huh
i
knows
dis
mare
doan
go
it
des
flash
my
why
is
it
julius
i
inquired

unner

minute
why

i
inquired
well

julius
replied
with
a
deep
sigh
it

the
tale
i
said
perhaps
by
the
time
you
get
through
the
haunt
will
go
away
and
the
mare
will
cross
i
was
willing
to
humor
the
old
man
fancy
he
had
not
told
us
a
story
for
some
time
and
the
dark
and
solemn
swamp
around
us
the
stream
flowing
silently
and
sluggishly
at
our
feet
like
the
waters
of
lethe
the
heavy
aromatic
scent
of
the
bays
faintly
suggestive
of
funeral
wreaths
all
made
the
place
an
ideal
one
for
a
ghost
story

neber
come

no

there
was
silence
when
the
old
man
had
finished
and
i
am
sure
i
saw
a
tear
in
my
wife
eye
and
more
than
one
in
mabel
i
think
julius
said
my
wife
after
a
moment
that
you
may
turn
the
mare
around
and
go
by
the
long
road
the
old
man
obeyed
with
alacrity
and
i
noticed
no
reluctance
on
the
mare
part
you
are
not
afraid
of
chloe
haunt
are
you
i
asked
jocularly
my
mood
was
not
responded
to
and
neither
of
the
ladies
smiled
oh
no
said
annie
but
i
changed
my
mind
i
prefer
the
other
route
when
we
had
reached
the
main
road
and
had
proceeded
along
it
for
a
short
distance
we
met
a
cart
driven
by
a
young
negro
and
on
the
cart
were
a
trunk
and
a
valise
we
recognized
the
man
as
malcolm
servant
and
drew
up
a
moment
to
speak
to
him
who
going
away
marshall
i
inquired
young
mistah
gwine
on
de
boat
ter
noo
dis
ebenin
suh
en
i
takin
his
things
down
ter
de
wharf
suh
this
was
news
to
me
and
i
heard
it
with
regret
my
wife
looked
sorry
too
and
i
could
see
that
mabel
was
trying
hard
to
hide
her
concern
he
comin
behin
suh
en
i
you
meet
up
de
road
a
piece
he
gwine
ter
walk
down
ez
fur
ez
mistah
jim
williams
en
take
de
buggy
fum
dere
ter
town
he
ter
be
gone
a
long
time
suh
en
say
he
ain
neber
comin
back
the
man
drove
on
there
were
a
few
words
exchanged
in
an
undertone
between
my
wife
and
mabel
which
i
did
not
catch
then
annie
said
julius
you
may
stop
the
rockaway
a
moment
there
are
some
by
the
road
there
that
i
want
will
you
get
them
for
me
john
i
sprang
into
the
underbrush
and
soon
returned
with
a
great
bunch
of
scarlet
blossoms
where
is
mabel
i
asked
noting
her
absence
she
has
walked
on
ahead
we
shall
overtake
her
in
a
few
minutes
the
carriage
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
when
my
wife
discovered
that
she
had
dropped
her
fan
i
had
it
where
we
were
stopping
julius
will
you
go
back
and
get
it
for
me
julius
got
down
and
went
back
for
the
fan
he
was
an
unconscionably
long
time
finding
it
after
we
got
started
again
we
had
gone
only
a
little
way
when
we
saw
mabel
and
young
murchison
coming
toward
us
they
were
walking
arm
in
arm
and
their
faces
were
aglow
with
the
light
of
love
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
julius
had
a
previous
understanding
with
malcolm
murchison
by
which
he
was
to
drive
us
round
by
the
long
road
that
day
nor
do
i
know
exactly
what
motive
influenced
the
old
exertions
in
the
matter
he
was
fond
of
mabel
but
i
was
old
enough
and
knew
julius
well
enough
to
be
skeptical
of
his
motives
it
is
certain
that
a
most
excellent
understanding
existed
between
him
and
murchison
after
the
reconciliation
and
that
when
the
young
people
set
up
housekeeping
over
at
the
old
murchison
place
julius
had
an
opportunity
to
enter
their
service
for
some
reason
or
other
however
he
preferred
to

and
of

south
dave
neckliss
have
some
dinner
uncle
julius
said
my
wife
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
in
early
autumn
our
two
had
gone
to
a
some
miles
away
and
would
not
return
until
evening
my
wife
had
served
the
dinner
and
we
were
just
rising
from
the
table
when
julius
came
up
the
lane
and
taking
off
his
hat
seated
himself
on
the
piazza
the
old
man
glanced
through
the
open
door
at
the
and
his
eyes
rested
lovingly
upon
a
large
ham
from
which
several
slices
had
been
cut
exposing
a
rich
pink
expanse
that
would
have
appealed
strongly
to
the
appetite
of
any
hungry
christian
thanky
miss
annie
he
said
after
a
momentary
hesitation
i
dunno
ez
i
keers
ef
i
does
a
piece
er
dat
ham
ef
yer
cut
me
off
a
slice
un
it
no
said
annie
i
wo
just
sit
down
to
the
table
and
help
yourself
eat
all
you
want
and
do
be
bashful
julius
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
table
while
my
wife
and
i
went
out
on
the
piazza
julius
was
in
my
employment
he
took
his
meals
with
his
own
family
but
when
he
happened
to
be
about
our
house
at
my
wife
never
let
him
go
away
hungry
i
threw
myself
into
a
hammock
from
which
i
could
see
julius
through
an
open
window
he
ate
with
evident
relish
devoting
his
attention
chiefly
to
the
ham
slice
after
slice
of
which
disappeared
in
the
spacious
cavity
of
his
mouth
at
first
the
old
man
ate
rapidly
but
after
the
edge
of
his
appetite
had
been
taken
off
he
proceeded
in
a
more
leisurely
manner
when
he
had
cut
the
sixth
slice
of
ham
i
kept
count
of
them
from
a
lazy
curiosity
to
see
how
much
he
eat
i
saw
him
lay
it
on
his
plate
as
he
adjusted
the
knife
and
fork
to
cut
it
into
smaller
pieces
he
paused
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
and
a
tear
rolled
down
his
rugged
cheek
and
fell
upon
the
slice
of
ham
before
him
but
the
emotion
whatever
the
thought
that
caused
it
was
transitory
and
in
a
moment
he
continued
his
dinner
when
he
was
through
eating
he
came
out
on
the
porch
and
resumed
his
seat
with
the
satisfied
expression
of
countenance
that
usually
follows
a
good
dinner
julius
i
said
you
seemed
to
be
affected
by
something
a
moment
ago
was
the
mustard
so
strong
that
it
moved
you
to
tears
no
suh
it
de
mustard
i
wuz
studyin
dave
who
was
dave
and
what
about
him
i
asked
the
conditions
were
all
favorable
to
there
was
an
autumnal
languor
in
the
air
and
a
dreamy
haze
softened
the
dark
green
of
the
distant
pines
and
the
deep
blue
of
the
southern
sky
the
generous
meal
he
had
made
had
put
the
old
man
in
a
very
good
humor
he
was
not
always
so
for
his
curiously
undeveloped
nature
was
subject
to
moods
which
were
almost
childish
in
their
variableness
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
we
were
able
to
study
through
the
medium
of
his
recollection
the
simple
but
intensely
human
inner
life
of
slavery
his
way
of
looking
at
the
past
seemed
very
strange
to
us
his
view
of
certain
sides
of
life
was
essentially
different
from
ours
he
never
indulged
in
any
regrets
for
the
arcadian
joyousness
and
irresponsibility
which
was
a
somewhat
popular
conception
of
slavery
his
had
not
been
the
lot
of
the
petted
but
that
of
the
toiling
while
he
mentioned
with
a
warm
appreciation
the
acts
of
kindness
which
those
in
authority
had
shown
to
him
and
his
people
he
would
speak
of
a
cruel
deed
not
with
the
indignation
of
one
accustomed
to
quick
feeling
and
spontaneous
expression
but
with
a
furtive
disapproval
which
suggested
to
us
a
doubt
in
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
he
had
a
right
to
think
or
to
feel
and
presented
to
us
the
curious
psychological
spectacle
of
a
mind
enslaved
long
after
the
shackles
had
been
struck
off
from
the
limbs
of
its
possessor
whether
the
sacred
name
of
liberty
ever
set
his
soul
aglow
with
a
generous
fire
whether
he
had
more
than
the
most
elementary
ideas
of
love
friendship
patriotism
religion
things
which
are
half
and
the
better
half
of
life
to
us
whether
he
even
realized
except
in
a
vague
uncertain
way
his
own
degradation
i
do
not
know
i
fear
not
and
if
not
then
centuries
of
repression
had
borne
their
legitimate
fruit
but
in
the
simple
human
feeling
and
still
more
in
the
undertone
of
sadness
which
pervaded
his
stories
i
thought
i
could
see
a
spark
which
fanned
by
favoring
breezes
and
fed
by
the
memories
of
the
past
might
become
in
his
children
children
a
glowing
flame
of
sensibility
alive
to
every
thrill
of
human
happiness
or
human
woe

er
poun
befo
i
gits
ter
studyin
dave
en
den
i
has
ter
stop
en
leab
de
res
fer
ernudder
time
there
was
a
short
silence
after
the
old
man
had
finished
his
story
and
then
my
wife
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
weather
on
which
subject
he
was
an
authority
i
went
into
the
house
when
i
came
out
half
an
hour
later
i
saw
julius
disappearing
down
the
lane
with
a
basket
on
his
arm
at
breakfast
next
morning
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
like
a
slice
of
ham
i
said
as
much
to
my
wife
oh
no
john
she
responded
you
should
eat
anything
so
heavy
for
breakfast
i
insisted
the
fact
is
she
said
pensively
i
could
have
eaten
any
more
of
that
ham
and
so
i
gave
it
to
julius
a
deep
sleeper
it
was
four
on
sunday
afternoon
in
the
month
of
july
the
air
had
been
hot
and
sultry
but
a
light
cool
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
occasional
cirrus
clouds
overspread
the
sun
and
for
a
while
subdued
his
fierceness
we
were
all
out
on
the
piazza
as
the
coolest
place
we
could
find
my
wife
my
and
i
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
sabbath
stillness
were
the
hum
of
an
occasional
vagrant
or
the
fragmentary
song
of
a
in
a
neighboring
elm
who
lazily
trolled
a
stave
of
melody
now
and
then
as
a
sample
of
what
he
could
do
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
or
after
a
light
shower
when
the
conditions
would
be
favorable
to
exertion
annie
said
i
suppose
to
relieve
the
deadly
dulness
of
the
afternoon
that
we
go
out
and
pull
the
big
watermelon
and
send
for
colonel
pemberton
folks
to
come
over
and
help
us
eat
it
is
it
ripe
yet
she
inquired
sleepily
brushing
away
a
troublesome
fly
that
had
impudently
settled
on
her
hair
yes
i
think
so
i
was
out
yesterday
with
julius
and
we
thumped
it
and
concluded
it
would
be
fully
ripe
by
tomorrow
or
next
day
but
i
think
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
pull
it
well
if
you
are
sure
dear
we
go
but
how

i
step
round
to
julius
cabin
and
ask
him
to
go
down
with
the
wheelbarrow
and
bring
it
up
i
replied
julius
was
an
elderly
colored
man
who
worked
on
the
plantation
and
lived
in
a
small
house
on
the
place
a
few
rods
from
my
own
residence
his
daughter
was
our
cook
and
other
members
of
his
family
served
us
in
different
capacities
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
i
saw
julius
coming
up
the
lane
he
had
on
his
sunday
clothes
and
was
probably
returning
from
the
afternoon
meeting
at
the
sandy
run
baptist
church
of
which
he
was
a
leading
member
and
deacon
julius
i
said
we
are
going
out
to
pull
the
big
watermelon
and
we
want
you
to
take
the
wheelbarrow
and
go
with
us
and
bring
it
up
to
the
house
does
yer
reckon

julius
ter
me

so
said
the
old
man
with
a
confirmatory
shake
of
the
head
yer

yer
pulls

de
julius
had
a
profound
contempt
for
poor
whites
and
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
for
expressing
it
he
assumed
that
we
shared
this
sentiment
while
in
fact
our
feeling
toward
this
listless
race
was
something
entirely
different
they
were
like
julius
himself
the
product
of
a
system
which
they
had
not
created
and
which
they
did
not
know
enough
to
resist
as
the
old
man
turned
to
go
away
he
began
to
limp
and
put
his
hand
to
his
knee
with
an
exclamation
of
pain
what
the
matter
julius
asked
my
wife
yes

her
sweet
young

but

disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
tom

a
lubberly
negro
boy
of
about

related
to

in

the

came

heah
comes
now
come
on
heah
wid
dat
yer
lazy
rascal
tom
came
slowly
round
the
house
with
the
wheelbarrow
and
stood
blinking
and
rolling
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
just
emerged
from
a
sound
sleep
and
was
not
yet
half
awake
we
took
our
way
around
the
house
the
ladies
and
i
in
front
julius
next
and
tom
bringing
up
the
rear
with
the
wheelbarrow
we
went
by
the
heavy
with
the
promise
of
an
abundant
harvest
through
a
narrow
field
of
yellowing
corn
and
then
picked
our
way
through
the
to
the
spot
where
the
monarch
of
the
patch
had
lain
the
day
before
in
all
the
glory
of
its
coat
of
variegated
green
there
was
a
shallow
concavity
in
the
sand
where
it
had
rested
but
the
melon
itself
was
gone
lonesome
ben
there
had
been
some
talk
among
local
capitalists
about
building
a
cotton
mill
on
beaver
creek
a
few
miles
from
my
place
on
the
sand
hills
in
north
carolina
and
i
had
been
approached
as
likely
to
take
an
interest
in
such
an
enterprise
while
i
had
the
matter
under
advisement
it
was
suggested
as
an
inducement
to
my
that
i
might
have
the
brick
for
the
mill
made
on
my
place
there
being
clay
there
suitable
for
the
purpose
and
thus
reduce
the
amount
of
my
actual
cash
investment
most
of
my
land
was
sandy
though
i
had
observed
several
outcroppings
of
clay
along
the
little
creek
or
branch
forming
one
of
my
boundaries
one
afternoon
in
summer
when
the
sun
was
low
and
the
heat
less
oppressive
than
it
had
been
earlier
in
the
day
i
ordered
julius
our
old
colored
coachman
to
harness
the
mare
to
the
rockaway
and
drive
me
to
look
at
the
when
we
were
ready
my
wife
who
wished
to
go
with
me
for
the
sake
of
the
drive
came
out
and
took
her
seat
by
my
side
we
reached
our
first
point
of
destination
by
a
road
running
across
the
plantation
between
a
field
of
maize
on
the
one
hand
and
a
broad
expanse
of
scuppernong
vines
on
the
other
the
road
led
us
past
a
cabin
occupied
by
one
of
my
as
the
carriage
went
by
at
a
walk
the
woman
of
the
house
came
to
the
door
and
curtsied
my
wife
made
some
inquiry
about
her
health
and
she
replied
that
it
was
poor
i
noticed
that
her
complexion
which
naturally
was
of
a
ruddy
brown
was
of
a
rather
sickly
hue
indeed
i
had
observed
a
greater
sallowness
among
both
the
colored
people
and
the
poor
whites
thereabouts
than
the
hygienic
conditions
of
the
neighborhood
seemed
to
justify
after
leaving
this
house
our
road
lay
through
a
cotton
field
for
a
short
distance
and
then
we
entered
a
strip
of
woods
through
which
ran
the
little
stream
beside
which
i
had
observed
the
clay
we
stopped
at
the
creek
the
road
by
which
we
had
come
crossing
it
and
continuing
over
the
land
of
my
neighbor
colonel
pemberton
by
the
roadside
on
my
own
land
a
bank
of
clay
rose
in
almost
a
sheer
perpendicular
for
about
ten
feet
evidently
extending
back
some
distance
into
the
low
hill
behind
it
and
having
also
frontage
upon
the
creek
there
were
marks
of
bare
feet
on
the
ground
along
the
base
of
the
bank
and
the
face
of
it
seemed
freshly
disturbed
and
scored
with
finger
marks
as
though
children
had
been
playing
there
do
you
think
that
clay
would
make
good
brick
julius
i
asked
the
old
man
who
had
been
unusually
quiet
during
the
drive
he
generally
played
with
the
whip
making
little
feints
at
the
mare
or
slapping
her
lightly
with
the
reins
or
admonishing
her
in
a
familiar
way
but
on
this
occasion
the
heat
or
some
other
cause
had
rendered
him
less
demonstrative
than
usual
yas
suh
i
knows
it
would
he
answered
how
do
you
know
has
it
ever
been
used
for
that
purpose
no
suh
but
i
got
my
reasons
fer
sayin
so
ole
mars
dugal
useter
hab
a
brickya
up
de
branch
i
dunno
as
yer
noticed
it
fer
all
growed
ober
wid
weeds
an
grass
mars
dugal
said
dis
yer
clay
wouldn
make
good
brick
but
i
knowed
better
i
judged
from
the
appearance
of
the
clay
that
it
was
probably
deficient
in
iron
it
was
of
a
tint
and
had
a
sort
of
greasy
look
well
i
said
we
drive
up
to
the
other
place
and
get
a
sample
of
that
clay
and
then
we
come
back
this
way
hold
on
a
minute
dear
said
my
wife
looking
at
her
watch
mabel
has
been
over
to
colonel
pemberton
all
the
afternoon
she
said
she
be
back
at
five
if
we
wait
here
a
little
while
she
be
along
and
we
can
take
her
with
us
all
right
i
said
we
wait
for
her
drive
up
a
little
farther
julius
by
that
jessamine
vine
while
we
were
waiting
a
white
woman
wearing
a
homespun
dress
and
came
down
the
road
from
the
other
side
of
the
creek
and
lifting
her
skirts
slightly
waded
with
bare
feet
across
the
shallow
stream
reaching
the
she
stooped
and
gathered
from
it
with
the
aid
of
a
convenient
stick
a
quantity
of
the
clay
which
she
pressed
together
in
the
form
of
a
ball
she
had
not
seen
us
at
first
the
bushes
partially
screening
us
but
when
having
secured
the
clay
she
turned
her
face
in
our
direction
and
caught
sight
of
us
watching
her
she
hid
the
lump
of
clay
in
her
pocket
with
a
shamefaced
look
and
hurried
away
by
the
road
she
had
come
what
is
she
going
to
do
with
that
uncle
julius
asked
my
wife
we
were
northern
settlers
and
still
new
to
some
of
the
customs
of
the
locality
concerning
which
we
often
looked
to
julius
for
information
he
had
lived
on
the
place
many
years
and
knew
the
neighborhood
thoroughly
she
gwineter
eat
it
miss
annie
he
replied
she
gits
outer
sight
ugh
said
my
wife
with
a
grimace
you
do
mean
she
going
to
eat
that
great
lump
of
clay
yas
i
does
dat
jes
i
means
gwineter
eat
bit
un
it
an
den
come
back
bimeby
fer
mo
i
should

them
sick
she
said
dey
gits

ter
it
said
julius
howsomeber
ef
dey

too
much
it
does
make
sick
an
i

he
added
looking
contemptuously
after
the
retreating
figure
of
the
woman
but
i
sees
black
folks
clay
dat
it
alluz
sets
me
ter
studyin
po
lonesome
ben
what
was
the
matter
with
ben
asked
my
wife
you
can
tell
us
while
we
waiting
for
mabel
old
julius
often
beguiled
our
leisure
with
stories
of
plantation
life
some
of
them
stories
which
we
found
to
be
in
general
circulation
among
the
colored
people
some
of
them
tales
of
real
life
as
julius
had
seen
it
in
the
old
slave
days
but
the
most
striking
were
we
suspected
purely
imaginary
or
so
colored
by
old
julius
fancy
as
to
make
us
speculate
at
times
upon
how
many
original
minds
which
might
have
added
to
the
world
wealth
of
literature
and
art
had
been
buried

now
an
dat
wuz
de
een
er
po
lonesome
ben
an
dat
de
reason
i
knows
dat
clay
make
brick
an
i
doan
nebber
lak
ter
see
no
black
folks
it
my
wife
came
of
a
family
of
reformers
who
could
never
contemplate
an
evil
without
seeking
an
immediate
remedy
when
i
decided
that
the
bank
of
edible
clay
was
not
fit
for
brickmaking
she
asked
me
if
i
would
not
have
it
carted
away
suggesting
at
the
same
time
that
it
could
be
used
to
fill
a
low
place
in
another
part
of
the
plantation
it
would
be
too
expensive
i
said
oh
no
she
replied
i
do
think
so
i
have
been
talking
with
uncle
julius
about
it
and
he
says
he
has
a
nephew
who
is
out
of
employment
and
who
will
take
the
contract
for
ten
dollars
if
you
will
furnish
the
mule
and
cart
and
board
him
while
the
job
lasts
as
i
had
no
desire
to
add
another
permanent
member
to
my
household
i
told
her
it
would
be
useless
that
if
the
people
did
not
get
clay
there
they
would
find
it
elsewhere
and
perhaps
an
inferior
quality
which
might
do
greater
harm
and
that
the
best
way
to
stop
them
from
eating
it
was
to
teach
them
when
she
had
opportunity
and
those
habits
of
industry
and
thrift
whereby
they
could
get
their
living
from
the
soil
in
a
manner
less
direct
but
more
commendable
superstitions
and
of
the
south
during
a
recent
visit
to
north
carolina
after
a
long
absence
i
took
occasion
to
inquire
into
the
prevalence
of
the
belief
in
what
was
known
as
conjuration
or
goopher
my
childish
recollection
of
which
i
have
elsewhere
embodied
into
a
number
of
stories
the
derivation
of
the
word
goopher
i
do
not
know
nor
whether
any
other
writer
than
myself
has
recognized
its
existence
though
it
is
in
frequent
use
in
certain
parts
of
the
south
the
origin
of
this
curious
superstition
itself
is
perhaps
more
easily
traceable
it
probably
grew
in
the
first
place
out
of
african
fetichism
which
was
brought
over
from
the
dark
continent
along
with
the
dark
people
certain
features
too
suggest
a
distant
affinity
with
voodooism
or
snake
worship
a
cult
which
seems
to
have
been
indigenous
to
tropical
america
these
beliefs
which
in
the
place
of
their
origin
had
all
the
sanctions
of
religion
and
social
custom
became
in
the
shadow
of
the
white
civilization
a
pale
reflection
of
their
former
selves
in
time
too
they
were
mingled
and
confused
with
the
witchcraft
and
ghost
lore
of
the
white
man
and
the
tricks
and
delusions
of
the
indian
conjurer
in
the
old
plantation
days
they
flourished
vigorously
though
discouraged
by
the
great
house
and
their
potency
was
well
established
among
the
blacks
and
the
poorer
whites
education
however
has
thrown
the
ban
of
disrepute
upon
witchcraft
and
conjuration
the
stern
frown
of
the
preacher
who
looks
upon
superstition
as
the
ally
of
the
evil
one
the
scornful
sneer
of
the
teacher
who
sees
in
it
a
part
of
the
livery
of
bondage
have
driven
this
quaint
combination
of
ancestral
traditions
to
the
remote
chimney
corners
of
old
black
aunties
from
which
it
is
difficult
for
the
stranger
to
unearth
them
harris
in
his
uncle
remus
stories
has
with
fine
literary
discrimination
collected
and
put
into
pleasing
and
enduring
form
the
plantation
stories
which
dealt
with
animal
lore
but
so
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
those
dealing
with
conjuration
that
they
seem
in
a
fair
way
to
disappear
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
the
loss
may
not
be
very
great
but
these
vanishing
traditions
might
furnish
valuable
data
for
the
sociologist
in
the
future
study
of
racial
development
in
writing
a
few
years
ago
the
volume
entitled
conjure
i
suspect
that
i
was
more
influenced
by
the
literary
value
of
the
material
than
by
its
sociological
bearing
and
therefore
took
or
thought
i
did
considerable
liberty
with
my
subject
imagination
however
can
only
act
upon
data
one
must
have
somewhere
in
his
consciousness
the
ideas
which
he
puts
together
to
form
a
connected
whole
creative
talent
of
whatever
grade
is
in
the
last
analysis
only
the
power
of
rearrangement
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
i
was
the
more
firmly
impressed
with
this
thought
after
i
had
interviewed
half
a
dozen
old
women
and
a
genuine
conjure
doctor
for
i
discovered
that
the
brilliant
touches
due
i
had
thought
to
my
own
imagination
were
after
all
but
dormant
ideas
lodged
in
my
childish
mind
by
old
aunt
this
and
old
uncle
that
and
awaiting
only
the
spur
of
imagination
to
bring
them
again
to
the
surface
for
instance
in
the
story
hannibal
there
figures
a
conjure
doll
with
pepper
feet
those
pepper
feet
i
regarded
as
peculiarly
my
own
a
purely
original
creation
i
heard
only
the
other
day
in
north
carolina
of
the
consternation
struck
to
the
heart
of
a
certain
dark
individual
upon
finding
upon
his
doorstep
a
foot
a
good
omen
in
itself
perhaps
to
which
a
malign
influence
had
been
imparted
by
tying
to
one
end
of
it
in
the
form
of
a
cross
two
small
pods
of
red
pepper
most
of
the
delusions
connected
with
this
belief
in
conjuration
grow
out
of
mere
lack
of
enlightenment
as
primeval
men
saw
a
personality
behind
every
natural
phenomenon
and
found
a
god
or
a
devil
in
wind
rain
and
hail
in
lightning
and
in
storm
so
the
untaught
man
or
woman
who
is
assailed
by
an
unusual
ache
or
pain
some
strenuous
symptom
of
serious
physical
disorder
is
prompt
to
accept
the
suggestion
which
tradition
approves
that
some
evil
influence
is
behind
his
discomfort
and
what
more
natural
than
to
conclude
that
some
rival
in
business
or
in
love
has
set
this
force
in
motion
relics
of
ancestral
barbarism
are
found
among
all
peoples
but
advanced
civilization
has
at
least
shaken
off
the
more
obvious
absurdities
of
superstition
we
no
longer
attribute
insanity
to
demoniac
possession
nor
suppose
that
a
king
touch
can
cure
scrofula
to
many
old
people
in
the
south
however
any
unusual
ache
or
pain
is
quite
as
likely
to
have
been
caused
by
some
external
evil
influence
as
by
natural
causes
tumors
sudden
swellings
due
to
inflammatory
rheumatism
or
the
bites
of
insects
are
especially
open
to
suspicion
paralysis
is
proof
positive
of
conjuration
if
there
is
any
doubt
the
conjure
doctor
invariably
removes
it
the
credulity
of
ignorance
is
his
chief
stock
in
trade
there
is
no
question
when
he
is
summoned
but
that
the
patient
has
been
tricked
the
means
of
conjuration
are
as
simple
as
the
indications
it
is
a
condition
of
all
witch
stories
that
there
must
in
some
way
be
contact
either
with
the
person
or
with
some
object
or
image
intended
to
represent
the
person
to
be
affected
or
if
not
actual
contact
at
least
close
proximity
the
charm
is
placed
under
the
or
buried
under
the
hearth
or
hidden
in
the
mattress
of
the
person
to
be
conjured
it
may
be
a
crude
attempt
to
imitate
the
body
of
the
victim
or
it
may
consist
merely
of
a
bottle
or
a
gourd
or
a
little
bag
containing
a
few
rusty
nails
crooked
pins
or
horsehairs
it
may
be
a
mysterious
mixture
thrown
surreptitiously
upon
the
person
to
be
injured
or
merely
a
line
drawn
across
a
road
or
path
which
line
it
is
fatal
for
a
certain
man
or
woman
to
cross
i
heard
of
a
case
of
a
laboring
man
who
went
two
miles
out
of
his
way
every
morning
and
evening
while
going
to
and
from
his
work
to
avoid
such
a
line
drawn
for
him
by
a
certain
powerful
enemy
some
of
the
more
gruesome
phases
of
the
belief
in
conjuration
suggest
possible
poisoning
a
knowledge
of
which
baleful
art
was
once
supposed
to
be
widespread
among
the
imported
negroes
of
the
olden
time
the
blood
or
venom
of
snakes
spiders
and
lizards
is
supposed
to
be
employed
for
this
purpose
the
results
of
its
administration
are
so
peculiar
however
and
so
entirely
improbable
that
one
is
supposed
to
doubt
even
the
initial
use
of
poison
and
figure
it
in
as
part
of
the
same
general
delusion
for
instance
a
certain
man
swelled
up
all
over
and
became
pieded
that
is
pied
or
spotted
a
white
physician
who
was
summoned
thought
that
the
man
thus
singularly
afflicted
was
poisoned
but
did
not
recognize
the
poison
nor
know
the
antidote
a
conjure
doctor
subsequently
called
in
was
more
prompt
in
his
diagnosis
the
man
he
said
was
poisoned
with
a
lizard
which
at
that
very
moment
was
lodged
somewhere
in
the
patient
anatomy
the
lizards
and
snakes
in
these
stories
by
the
way
are
not
confined
to
the
usual
ducts
and
cavities
of
the
human
body
but
seem
to
have
freedom
of
movement
throughout
the
whole
structure
this
lizard
according
to
the
doctor
would
start
from
the
man
shoulder
descend
to
his
hand
return
to
the
shoulder
and
pass
down
the
side
of
the
body
to
the
leg
when
it
reached
the
calf
of
the
leg
the
lizard
head
would
appear
right
under
the
skin
after
it
had
been
perceptible
for
three
days
the
lizard
was
to
be
cut
out
with
a
razor
or
the
man
would
die
sure
enough
the
lizard
manifested
its
presence
in
the
appointed
place
at
the
appointed
time
but
the
patient
would
not
permit
the
surgery
and
at
the
end
of
three
days
paid
with
death
the
penalty
of
his
obstinacy
old
aunt
harriet
told
me
with
solemn
earnestness
that
she
herself
had
taken
a
snake
from
her
own
arm
in
sections
after
a
similar
experience
old
harriet
may
have
been
lying
but
was
i
imagine
merely
witches
prior
to
being
burned
have
often
confessed
their
commerce
with
the
evil
one
why
should
harriet
hesitate
to
relate
a
simple
personal
experience
which
involved
her
in
no
blame
whatever
old
uncle
jim
a
shrewd
hard
old
sinner
and
a
palpable
fraud
who
did
not
i
imagine
believe
in
himself
to
any
great
extent
gave
me
some
private
points
as
to
the
manner
in
which
these
reptiles
were
thus
transferred
to
the
human
system
if
a
snake
or
a
lizard
be
killed
and
a
few
drops
of
its
blood
be
dried
upon
a
plate
or
in
a
gourd
the
person
next
eating
or
drinking
from
the
contaminated
vessel
will
soon
become
the
unwilling
landlord
of
a
reptilian
tenant
there
are
other
avenues
too
by
which
the
reptile
may
gain
admittance
but
when
expelled
by
the
conjure
doctor
arts
or
medicines
it
always
leaves
at
the
point
where
it
entered
this
belief
may
have
originally
derived
its
existence
from
the
fact
that
certain
tropical
insects
sometimes
lay
their
eggs
beneath
the
skins
of
animals
or
even
of
men
from
which
it
is
difficult
to
expel
them
until
the
larvae
are
hatched
the
chico
or
jigger
of
the
west
indies
and
the
spanish
main
is
the
most
obvious
example
old

last

uncertain
since
she
had
borne
those
of
her
master
her
mother
her
putative
father
and
half
a
dozen
husbands
in
succession
no
one
of
which
seemed
to
take
undisputed
precedence
related
some
very
remarkable
experiences
she
at
first
manifested
some
reluctance
to
speak
of
conjuration
in
the
lore
of
which
she
was
said
to
be
well
versed
but
by
listening
patiently
to
her
religious
experiences
she
was
a
dreamer
of
dreams
and
a
seer
of
visions
i
was
able
now
and
then
to
draw
a
little
upon
her
reserves
of
superstition
if
indeed
her
religion
itself
was
much
more
than
superstition

very
obviously
harriet
had
sprained
her
ankle
while
looking
at
the
old
man
instead
of
watching
the
path
and
the
hot
fomentation
had
reduced
the
swelling
she
is
not
the
first
person
to
hear
spirit
voices
in
his
or
her
own
vagrant
imaginings
on
another
occasion
aunt
harriet
finger
swelled
up
as
big
as
a
corn
cob
she
at
first
supposed
the
swelling
to
be
due
to
a
felon
she
went
to
old
uncle
julius
lutterloh
who
told
her
that
some
one
had
tricked
her
my
lawd
she
exclaimed
how
did
they
fix
my
finger
he
explained
that
it
was
done
while
in
the
act
of
shaking
hands
doctor
julius
opened
the
finger
with
a
sharp
knife
and
showed
harriet
two
seeds
at
the
bottom
of
the
incision
he
instructed
her
to
put
a
poultice
of
red
onions
on
the
wound
over
night
and
in
the
morning
the
seeds
would
come
out
she
was
then
to
put
the
two
seeds
in
a
skillet
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
in
a
pint
of
water
and
let
them
simmer
nine
mornings
and
on
the
ninth
morning
she
was
to
let
all
the
water
simmer
out
and
when
the
last
drop
should
have
gone
the
one
that
put
the
seeds
in
her
hand
was
to
go
out
of
this
world
harriet
however
did
not
pursue
the
treatment
to
the
bitter
end
the
seeds
once
extracted
she
put
into
a
small
phial
which
she
corked
up
tightly
and
put
carefully
away
in
her
bureau
drawer
one
morning
she
went
to
look
at
them
and
one
of
them
was
gone
shortly
afterwards
the
other
disappeared
aunt
harriet
has
a
theory
that
she
had
been
tricked
by
a
woman
of
whom
her
husband
of
that
time
was
unduly
fond
and
that
the
faithless
husband
had
returned
the
seeds
to
their
original
owner
a
part
of
the
scheme
of
conjuration
is
that
the
conjure
doctor
can
remove
the
spell
and
put
it
back
upon
the
one
who
laid
it
i
was
unable
to
learn
however
of
any
instance
where
this
extreme
penalty
had
been
insisted
upon
it
is
seldom
that
any
of
these
old
negroes
will
admit
that
he
or
she
possesses
the
power
to
conjure
though
those
who
can
remove
spells
are
very
willing
to
make
their
accomplishment
known
and
to
exercise
it
for
a
consideration
the
only
professional
conjure
doctor
whom
i
met
was
old
uncle
jim
davis
with
whom
i
arranged
a
personal
interview
he
came
to
see
me
one
evening
but
almost
immediately
upon
his
arrival
a
minister
called
the
powers
of
light
prevailed
over
those
of
darkness
and
jim
was
dismissed
until
a
later
time
with
a
commission
to
prepare
for
me
a
conjure
hand
or
good
luck
charm
of
which
he
informed
some
of
the
children
about
the
house
who
were
much
interested
in
the
proceedings
i
was
very
much
in
need
i
subsequently
secured
the
charm
for
which
considering
its
potency
the
small
sum
of
silver
it
cost
me
was
no
extravagant
outlay
it
is
a
very
small
bag
of
roots
and
herbs
and
if
used
according
to
directions
is
guaranteed
to
insure
me
good
luck
and
keep
me
from
losing
my
job
the
directions
require
it
to
be
wet
with
spirits
nine
mornings
in
succession
to
be
carried
on
the
person
in
a
pocket
on
the
right
hand
side
care
being
taken
that
it
does
not
come
in
contact
with
any
tobacco
when
i
add
that
i
procured
from
an
equally
trustworthy
source
a
genuine
graveyard
rabbit
foot
i
would
seem
to
be
reasonably
well
protected
against
casual
misfortune
i
shall
not
however
presume
upon
this
immunity
and
shall
omit
no
reasonable
precaution
which
the
condition
of
my
health
or
my
affairs
may
render
prudent
an
interesting
conjure
story
which
i
heard
involves
the
fate
of
a
lost
voice
a
certain
woman
lover
was
enticed
away
by
another
woman
who
sang
very
sweetly
and
who
the
jilted
one
suspected
had
told
lies
about
her
having
decided
upon
the
method
of
punishment
for
this
wickedness
the
injured
woman
watched
the
other
closely
in
order
to
find
a
suitable
opportunity
for
carrying
out
her
purpose
but
in
vain
for
the
fortunate
one
knowing
of
her
enmity
would
never
speak
to
her
or
remain
near
her
one
day
the
jilted
woman
plucked
a
red
rose
from
her
garden
and
hid
herself
in
the
bushes
near
her
rival
cabin
very
soon
an
old
woman
came
by
who
was
accosted
by
the
woman
in
hiding
and
requested
to
hand
the
red
rose
to
the
woman
of
the
house
the
old
woman
suspecting
no
evil
took
the
rose
and
approached
the
house
the
other
woman
following
her
closely
but
keeping
herself
always
out
of
sight
when
the
old
woman
having
reached
the
door
and
called
out
the
mistress
of
the
house
delivered
the
rose
as
requested
the
recipient
thanked
the
giver
in
a
loud
voice
knowing
the
old
woman
to
be
somewhat
deaf
at
the
moment
she
spoke
the
woman
in
hiding
reached
up
and
caught
her
rival
voice
and
clasping
it
tightly
in
her
right
hand
escaped
unseen
to
her
own
cabin
at
the
same
instant
the
afflicted
woman
missed
her
voice
and
felt
a
sharp
pain
shoot
through
her
left
arm
just
below
the
elbow
she
at
first
suspected
the
old
woman
of
having
tricked
her
through
the
medium
of
the
red
rose
but
was
subsequently
informed
by
a
conjure
doctor
that
her
voice
had
been
stolen
and
that
the
old
woman
was
innocent
for
the
pain
he
gave
her
a
bottle
of
medicine
of
which
nine
drops
were
to
be
applied
three
times
a
day
and
rubbed
in
with
the
first
two
fingers
of
the
right
hand
care
being
taken
not
to
let
any
other
part
of
the
hand
touch
the
arm
as
this
would
render
the
medicine
useless
by
the
aid
of
a
mirror
in
which
he
called
up
her
image
the
conjure
doctor
ascertained
who
was
the
guilty
person
he
sought
her
out
and
charged
her
with
the
crime
which
she
promptly
denied
being
pressed
however
she
admitted
her
guilt
the
doctor
insisted
upon
immediate
restitution
she
expressed
her
willingness
and
at
the
same
time
her
inability
to
comply
she
had
taken
the
voice
but
did
not
possess
the
power
to
restore
it
the
conjure
doctor
was
obdurate
and
at
once
placed
a
spell
upon
her
which
is
to
remain
until
the
lost
voice
is
restored
the
case
is
still
pending
i
understand
i
shall
sometime
take
steps
to
find
out
how
it
terminates
how
far
a
story
like
this
is
original
and
how
far
a
mere
reflection
of
familiar
wonder
stories
is
purely
a
matter
of
speculation
when
the
old
mammies
would
tell
the
tales
of
rabbit
and
fox
to
the
master
children
these
in
turn
would
no
doubt
repeat
the
fairy
tales
which
they
had
read
in
books
or
heard
from
their
parents
lips
the
magic
mirror
is
as
old
as
literature
the
inability
to
restore
the
stolen
voice
is
foreshadowed
in
the
when
the
open
sesame
is
forgotten
the
act
of
catching
the
voice
has
a
simplicity
which
stamps
it
as
original
the
only
analogy
of
which
i
can
at
present
think
being
the
story
of
later
date
of
the
words
which
were
frozen
silent
during
the
extreme
cold
of
an
arctic
winter
and
became
audible
