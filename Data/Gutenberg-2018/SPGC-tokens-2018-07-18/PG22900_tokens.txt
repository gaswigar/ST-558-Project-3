conclusion

of

clark
provost
of
oriel
college
rather
more
than
twenty
years
ago
on
a
spring
morning
of
alternate
cloud
and
sunshine
i
acted
as
guide
to
johan
huizinga
the
author
of
this
book
when
he
was
on
a
visit
to
oxford
as
it
was
not
his
first
stay
in
the
city
and
he
knew
the
principal
buildings
already
we
looked
at
some
of
the
less
famous
even
with
a
man
who
was
well
known
all
over
the
world
as
a
writer
i
expected
that
these
two
or
three
hours
would
be
much
like
the
others
i
had
spent
in
the
same
capacity
with
other
visitors
but
this
proved
to
be
a
day
to
remember
he
understood
the
purposes
of
these
ancient
buildings
the
intentions
of
their
founders
and
builders
but
that
was
to
be
expected
from
an
historian
who
had
written
upon
the
history
of
universities
and
learning
what
surprised
and
delighted
me
was
his
seeing
eye
he
told
me
which
of
the
decorative
on
the
tower
of
the
four
orders
were
usual
at
the
time
when
it
was
built
and
which
were
less
common
at
all
souls
he
pointed
out
the
seldom
appreciated
merits
of
hawksmoor
twin
towers
his
eye
was
not
merely
informed
but
sensitive
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
of
his
talent
for
drawing
and
as
we
walked
and
talked
i
felt
the
influence
of
a
strong
quiet
personality
deep
down
in
which
an
perceptiveness
was
fused
with
a
determination
to
search
for
historical
truth
huizinga
great
success
and
reputation
came
suddenly
when
he
was
over
forty
until
that
time
his
powers
were
ripening
not
so
much
slowly
as
secretly
his
friends
knew
that
he
was
unique
but
neither
he
nor
they
foresaw
what
direction
his
studies
would
take
he
was
born
in
in
groningen
the
most
northerly
of
the
chief
towns
of
the
netherlands
and
there
he
went
to
school
and
to
the
university
he
studied
dutch
history
and
literature
and
also
oriental
languages
and
mythology
and
sociology
he
was
a
good
linguist
and
he
steadily
accumulated
great
learning
but
he
was
neither
an
infant
prodigy
nor
a
universal
scholar
science
and
current
affairs
scarcely
interested
him
and
until
his
maturity
imagination
seemed
to
satisfy
him
more
than
research
until
he
was
over
thirty
he
was
a
schoolmaster
at
haarlem
a
teacher
of
history
but
it
was
still
uncertain
whether
european
or
oriental
studies
would
claim
him
in
the
end
for
two
or
three
years
before
giving
up
he
lectured
in
the
university
of
amsterdam
on
sanskrit
and
it
was
almost
an
accident
that
he
became
professor
of
history
in
the
university
of
his
native
town
all
through
his
life
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
after
a
spell
of
creative
work
when
he
had
finished
a
book
he
would
turn
aside
from
the
subject
that
had
absorbed
him
and
plunge
into
some
other
subject
or
period
so
that
the
books
and
articles
in
the
eight
volumes
of
his
collected
works
with
one
more
volume
still
to
come
cover
a
very
wide
range
as
time
went
on
he
examined
aspects
of
history
which
at
first
he
had
passed
over
and
he
acquired
a
clear
insight
into
the
political
and
economic
life
of
the
past
it
has
been
well
said
of
him
that
he
never
became
either
a
pedant
or
a
doctrinaire
during
the
ten
years
that
he
spent
as
professor
at
groningen
he
found
himself
he
was
happily
married
with
a
growing
family
and
the
many
elements
of
his
mind
drew
together
into
a
unity
his
sensitiveness
to
style
and
beauty
came
to
terms
with
his
conscientious
scholarship
he
was
rooted
in
the
traditional
freedoms
of
his
national
and
academic
environment
but
his
curiosity
like
the
historical
adventures
of
his
people
and
his
profession
was
not
limited
by
time
or
space
or
prejudice
he
came
more
and
more
definitely
to
find
his
central
theme
in
civilization
as
a
realized
ideal
something
that
men
have
created
in
an
endless
variety
of
forms
but
always
in
order
to
raise
the
level
of
their
lives
while
this
interior
fulfilment
was
bringing
huizinga
to
his
best
the
world
about
him
changed
completely
in
holland
became
a
neutral
country
surrounded
by
nations
at
war
in
also
his
wife
died
and
it
was
as
a
lonely
widower
that
he
was
appointed
in
the
next
year
to
the
chair
of
general
history
at
leyden
which
he
was
to
hold
for
the
rest
of
his
academic
life
yet
the
year
after
the
end
of
the
war
saw
the
publication
of
his
masterpiece
the
book
which
gave
him
his
high
place
among
historical
writers
and
was
translated
as
waning
of
the
middle
this
is
a
study
of
the
forms
of
life
and
thought
in
france
and
the
netherlands
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
the
last
phase
of
one
of
the
great
european
eras
of
civilization
in
england
where
the
middle
ages
had
been
idealized
for
generations
some
of
its
leading
thoughts
did
not
seem
so
novel
as
they
did
in
holland
where
many
people
regarded
the
renaissance
and
more
still
regarded
the
reformation
as
a
new
beginning
of
a
better
world
but
in
england
and
america
which
had
been
drawn
unlike
holland
into
the
vortex
of
war
it
had
the
poignancy
of
a
recall
to
the
standards
of
reasonableness
it
will
long
maintain
its
place
as
a
historical
book
and
as
a
work
of
literature
the
shorter
book
on
erasmus
is
a
companion
to
this
great
work
it
was
first
published
in
and
so
belongs
to
the
same
best
period
of
the
author
its
subject
is
the
central
intellectual
figure
of
the
next
generation
after
the
period
which
huizinga
called
the
waning
or
rather
the
autumn
of
the
middle
ages
but
erasmus
was
also
as
will
appear
from
many
of
its
pages
a
man
for
whom
he
had
a
very
special
sympathy
something
of
what
he
wrote
about
erasmus
might
also
have
been
written
about
himself
or
at
least
about
his
own
response
to
the
transformation
of
the
world
that
he
had
known
this
is
not
the
place
for
an
analysis
of
that
questioning
and
illuminating
response
nor
for
a
considered
estimate
of
huizinga
work
as
a
whole
but
there
is
room
for
a
word
about
his
last
years
he
was
recognized
as
one
of
the
intellectual
leaders
of
his
country
and
a
second
marriage
in
brought
back
his
private
happiness
but
the
shadows
were
darkening
over
the
western
world
from
the
time
when
national
socialism
began
to
reveal
itself
in
germany
he
took
his
stand
against
it
with
perfect
simplicity
and
calm
after
the
invasion
of
holland
he
addressed
these
memorable
words
to
some
of
his
colleagues
it
comes
as
it
soon
will
to
defending
our
university
and
the
freedom
of
science
and
learning
in
the
netherlands
we
must
be
ready
to
give
everything
for
that
our
possessions
our
freedom
and
even
our
lives
the
germans
closed
the
university
for
a
time
they
held
johan
huizinga
now
an
old
man
and
in
failing
health
as
a
hostage
then
they
banished
him
to
open
arrest
in
a
remote
parish
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
even
in
these
conditions
he
still
wrote
and
wrote
well
in
the
last
winter
of
the
war
the
liberating
armies
approached
and
he
suffered
the
hardships
of
the
civilian
population
in
a
theatre
of
war
but
his
spirit
was
unbroken
he
died
on
february
a
few
weeks
before
his
country
was

twenty
years
formed

of

which
the

had
succeeded

with
those

mentioned
make
up
the

of

had
not
yet
been

under
burgundian
dominion
although
the
dukes
had
cast
their
eyes
on
them
in
the
bishopric
of
utrecht
whose
power
extended
to
the
regions
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
ysel
burgundian
influence
had
already
begun
to
make
itself
manifest
the
projected
conquest
of
friesland
was
a
political
inheritance
of
the
counts
of
holland
who
preceded
the
burgundians
the
duchy
of
guelders
alone
still
preserved
its
independence
inviolate
being
more
closely
connected
with
the
neighbouring
german
territories
and
consequently
with
the
empire
itself
all
these
lands
about
this
time
they
began
to
be
regarded
collectively
under
the
name
of
countries
by
the
sea
had
in
most
respects
the
character
of
outskirts
the
authority
of
the
german
emperors
had
for
some
centuries
been
little
more
than
imaginary
holland
and
zealand
hardly
shared
the
dawning
sense
of
a
national
german
union
they
had
too
long
looked
to
france
in
matters
political
since
a
dynasty
that
of
hainault
had
ruled
holland
even
the
house
of
bavaria
that
succeeded
it
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
had
not
restored
closer
contact
with
the
empire
but
had
itself
on
the
contrary
early
become
gallicized
attracted
as
it
was
by
paris
and
soon
twined
about
by
the
tentacles
of
burgundy
to
which
it
became
linked
by
means
of
a
double
marriage
the
northern
half
of
the
low
countries
were
also
in
ecclesiastical
and
cultural
matters
brought
over
rather
late
to
the
cause
of
christianity
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
they
had
as
borderlands
remained
united
under
a
single
bishop
the
bishop
of
utrecht
the
meshes
of
ecclesiastical
organization
were
wider
here
than
elsewhere
they
had
no
university
paris
remained
even
after
the
designing
policy
of
the
burgundian
dukes
had
founded
the
university
of
louvain
in
the
centre
of
doctrine
and
science
for
the
northern
netherlands
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
wealthy
towns
of
flanders
and
brabant
now
the
heart
of
the
burgundian
possessions
holland
and
zealand
formed
a
wretched
little
country
of
boatmen
and
peasants
chivalry
which
the
dukes
of
burgundy
attempted
to
invest
with
new
splendour
had
but
moderately
thrived
among
the
nobles
of
holland
the
dutch
had
not
enriched
courtly
literature
in
which
flanders
and
brabant
zealously
strove
to
follow
the
french
example
by
any
contribution
worth
mentioning
whatever
was
coming
up
in
holland
flowered
unseen
it
was
not
of
a
sort
to
attract
the
attention
of
christendom
it
was
a
brisk
navigation
and
trade
mostly
transit
trade
by
which
the
hollanders
already
began
to
emulate
the
german
hansa
and
which
brought
them
into
continual
contact
with
france
and
spain
england
and
scotland
scandinavia
north
germany
and
the
rhine
from
cologne
upward
it
was
herring
fishery
a
humble
trade
but
the
source
of
great
prosperity
a
rising
industry
shared
by
a
number
of
small
towns
not
one
of
those
towns
in
holland
and
zealand
neither
dordrecht
nor
leyden
haarlem
middelburg
amsterdam
could
compare
with
ghent
bruges
lille
antwerp
or
brussels
in
the
south
it
is
true
that
in
the
towns
of
holland
also
the
highest
products
of
the
human
mind
germinated
but
those
towns
themselves
were
still
too
small
and
too
poor
to
be
centres
of
art
and
science
the
most
eminent
men
were
irresistibly
drawn
to
one
of
the
great
foci
of
secular
and
ecclesiastical
culture
sluter
the
great
sculptor
went
to
burgundy
took
service
with
the
dukes
and
bequeathed
no
specimen
of
his
art
to
the
land
of
his
birth
dirk
bouts
the
artist
of
haarlem
removed
to
louvain
where
his
best
work
is
preserved
what
was
left
at
haarlem
has
perished
at
haarlem
too
and
earlier
perhaps
than
anywhere
else
obscure
experiments
were
being
made
in
that
great
art
craving
to
be
brought
forth
which
was
to
change
the
world
the
art
of
printing
there
was
yet
another
characteristic
spiritual
phenomenon
which
originated
here
and
gave
its
peculiar
stamp
to
life
in
these
countries
it
was
a
movement
designed
to
give
depth
and
fervour
to
religious
life
started
by
a
burgher
of
deventer
geert
groote
toward
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
had
embodied
itself
in
two
closely
connected
forms
the
fraterhouses
where
the
brethren
of
the
common
life
lived
together
without
altogether
separating
from
the
world
and
the
congregation
of
the
monastery
of
windesheim
of
the
order
of
the
regular
augustinian
canons
originating
in
the
regions
on
the
banks
of
the
ysel
between
the
two
small
towns
of
deventer
and
zwolle
and
so
on
the
outskirts
of
the
diocese
of
utrecht
this
movement
soon
spread
eastward
to
westphalia
northward
to
groningen
and
the
frisian
country
westward
to
holland
proper
fraterhouses
were
erected
everywhere
and
monasteries
of
the
windesheim
congregation
were
established
or
affiliated
the
movement
was
spoken
of
as
devotion
it
was
rather
a
matter
of
sentiment
and
practice
than
of
definite
doctrine
the
truly
catholic
character
of
the
movement
had
early
been
acknowledged
by
the
church
authorities
sincerity
and
modesty
simplicity
and
industry
and
above
all
constant
ardour
of
religious
emotion
and
thought
were
its
objects
its
energies
were
devoted
to
tending
the
sick
and
other
works
of
charity
but
especially
to
instruction
and
the
art
of
writing
it
is
in
this
that
it
especially
differed
from
the
revival
of
the
franciscan
and
dominican
orders
of
about
the
same
time
which
turned
to
preaching
the
windesheimians
and
the
hieronymians
as
the
brethren
of
the
common
life
were
also
called
exerted
their
crowning
activities
in
the
seclusion
of
the
schoolroom
and
the
silence
of
the
writing
cell
the
schools
of
the
brethren
soon
drew
pupils
from
a
wide
area
in
this
way
the
foundations
were
laid
both
here
in
the
northern
netherlands
and
in
lower
germany
for
a
generally
diffused
culture
among
the
middle
classes
a
culture
of
a
very
narrow
strictly
ecclesiastical
nature
indeed
but
which
for
that
very
reason
was
fit
to
permeate
broad
layers
of
the
people
what
the
windesheimians
themselves
produced
in
the
way
of
devotional
literature
is
chiefly
limited
to
edifying
booklets
and
biographies
of
their
own
members
writings
which
were
distinguished
rather
by
their
pious
tenor
and
sincerity
than
by
daring
or
novel
thoughts
but
of
them
all
the
greatest
was
that
immortal
work
of
thomas
à
kempis
canon
of
saint
agnietenberg
near
zwolle
the
foreigners
visiting
these
regions
north
of
the
scheldt
and
the
meuse
laughed
at
the
rude
manners
and
the
deep
drinking
of
the
inhabitants
but
they
also
mentioned
their
sincere
piety
these
countries
were
already
what
they
have
ever
remained
somewhat
contemplative
and
better
adapted
for
speculating
on
the
world
and
for
reproving
it
than
for
astonishing
it
with
dazzling
wit
rotterdam
and
gouda
situated
upward
of
twelve
miles
apart
in
the
lowest
region
of
holland
an
extremely
watery
region
were
not
among
the
first
towns
of
the
county
they
were
small
country
towns
ranking
after
dordrecht
haarlem
leyden
and
rapidly
rising

they

of

erasmus
was
born
at
rotterdam
on
october
most
probably
in
the
year
the
illegitimacy
of
his
birth
has
thrown
a
veil
of
mystery
over
his
descent
and
kinship
it
is
possible
that
erasmus
himself
learned
the
circumstances
of
his
coming
into
the
world
only
in
his
later
years
acutely
sensitive
to
the
taint
in
his
origin
he
did
more
to
veil
the
secret
than
to
reveal
it
the
picture
which
he
painted
of
it
in
his
ripe
age
was
romantic
and
pathetic
he
imagined
that
his
father
when
a
young
man
made
love
to
a
girl
a
daughter
in
the
hope
of
marrying
her
the
parents
and
brothers
of
the
young
fellow
indignant
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
holy
orders
the
young
man
fled
before
the
child
was
born
he
went
to
rome
and
made
a
living
by
copying
his
relations
sent
him
false
tidings
that
his
beloved
had
died
out
of
grief
he
became
a
priest
and
devoted
himself
to
religion
altogether
returned
to
his
native
country
he
discovered
the
deceit
he
abstained
from
all
contact
with
her
whom
he
now
could
no
longer
marry
but
took
great
pains
to
give
his
son
a
liberal
education
the
mother
continued
to
care
for
the
child
till
an
early
death
took
her
from
him
the
father
soon
followed
her
to
the
grave
to
recollection
he
was
only
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
when
his
mother
died
it
seems
to
be
practically
certain
that
her
death
did
not
occur
before
when
therefore
he
was
already
seventeen
years
old
his
sense
of
chronology
was
always
remarkably
ill
developed
unfortunately
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
erasmus
himself
knew
or
had
known
that
not
all
particulars
of
this
version
were
correct
in
all
probability
his
father
was
already
a
priest
at
the
time
of
the
relationship
to
which
he
owed
his
life
in
any
case
it
was
not
the
impatience
of
a
betrothed
couple
but
an
irregular
alliance
of
long
standing
of
which
a
brother
peter
had
been
born
three
years
before
we
can
only
vaguely
discern
the
outlines
of
a
numerous
and
commonplace
family
the
father
had
nine
brothers
who
were
all
married
the
grandparents
on
his
father
side
and
the
uncles
on
his
side
attained
to
a
very
great
age
it
is
strange
that
a
host
of
cousins
their
progeny
has
not
boasted
of
a
family
connection
with
the
great
erasmus
their
descendants
have
not
even
been
traced
what
were
their
names
the
fact
that
in
burgher
circles
family
names
had
as
yet
become
anything
but
fixed
makes
it
difficult
to
trace
kinsmen
usually
people
were
called
by
their
own
and
their
name
but
it
also
happened
that
the
father
name
became
fixed
and
adhered
to
the
following
generation
erasmus
calls
his
father
gerard
his
brother
peter
gerard
while
a
papal
letter
styles
erasmus
himself
erasmus
rogerii
possibly
the
father
was
called
roger
gerard
or
gerards
although
erasmus
and
his
brother
were
born
at
rotterdam
there
is
much
that
points
to
the
fact
that
his
father
kin
did
not
belong
there
but
at
gouda
at
any
rate
they
had
near
relatives
at
gouda
erasmus
was
his
christian
name
there
is
nothing
strange
in
the
choice
although
it
was
rather
unusual
erasmus
was
one
of
the
fourteen
holy
martyrs
whose
worship
so
much
engrossed
the
attention
of
the
multitude
in
the
fifteenth
century
perhaps
the
popular
belief
that
the
intercession
of
erasmus
conferred
wealth
had
some
weight
in
choosing
the
name
up
to
the
time
when
he
became
better
acquainted
with
greek
he
used
the
form
herasmus
later
on
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
also
given
that
name
the
more
correct
and
melodious
form
erasmius
on
a
few
occasions
he
half
jocularly
called
himself
so
and
his
godchild
johannes
froben
son
always
used
this
form
it
was
probably
for
similar
aesthetic
considerations
that
he
soon
altered
the
barbaric
rotterdammensis
to
roterdamus
later
roterodamus
which
he
perhaps
accentuated
as
a
proparoxytone
desiderius
was
an
addition
selected
by
himself
which
he
first
used
in
it
is
possible
that
the
study
of
his
favourite
author
jerome
among
whose
correspondents
there
is
a
desiderius
suggested
the
name
to
him
when
therefore
the
full
form
desiderius
erasmus
roterodamus
first
appears
in
the
second
edition
of
the
published
by
josse
badius
at
paris
in
it
is
an
indication
that
erasmus
then
forty
years
of
age
had
found
himself
circumstances
had
not
made
it
easy
for
him
to
find
his
way
almost
in
his
infancy
when
hardly
four
years
old
he
thinks
he
had
been
put
to
school
at
gouda
together
with
his
brother
he
was
nine
years
old
when
his
father
sent
him
to
deventer
to
continue
his
studies
in
the
famous
school
of
the
chapter
of
lebuin
his
mother
accompanied
him
his
stay
at
deventer
must
have
lasted
with
an
interval
during
which
he
was
a
choir
boy
in
the
minster
at
utrecht
from
to
explicit
declaration
that
he
was
fourteen
years
old
when
he
left
deventer
may
be
explained
by
assuming
that
in
later
years
he
confused
his
temporary
absence
from
deventer
when
at
utrecht
with
the
definite
end
of
his
stay
at
deventer
reminiscences
of
his
life
there
repeatedly
crop
up
in
erasmus
writings
those
concerning
the
teaching
he
got
inspired
him
with
little
gratitude
the
school
was
still
barbaric
then
he
said
ancient
medieval
were
used
there
of
whose
silliness
and
cumbrousness
we
can
hardly
conceive
some
of
the
masters
were
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
common
life
one
of
them
johannes
synthen
brought
to
his
task
a
certain
degree
of
understanding
of
classic
antiquity
in
its
purer
form
toward
the
end
of
erasmus
residence
alexander
hegius
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
school
a
friend
of
the
frisian
humanist
rudolf
agricola
who
on
his
return
from
italy
was
gaped
at
by
his
compatriots
as
a
prodigy
on
festal
days
when
the
rector
made
his
oration
before
all
the
pupils
erasmus
heard
hegius
on
one
single
occasion
he
listened
to
the
celebrated
agricola
himself
which
left
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
his
mother
death
of
the
plague
that
ravaged
the
town
brought
at
deventer
to
a
sudden
close
his
father
called
him
and
his
brother
back
to
gouda
only
to
die
himself
soon
afterwards
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
culture
for
he
knew
greek
had
heard
the
famous
humanists
in
italy
had
copied
classic
authors
and
left
a
library
of
some
value
erasmus
and
his
brother
were
now
under
the
protection
of
three
guardians
whose
care
and
intentions
he
afterwards
placed
in
an
unfavourable
light
how
far
he
exaggerated
their
treatment
of
him
it
is
difficult
to
decide
that
the
guardians
among
whom
one
peter
winckel
schoolmaster
at
gouda
occupied
the
principal
place
had
little
sympathy
with
the
new
classicism
about
which
their
ward
already
felt
enthusiastic
need
not
be
doubted
you
should
write
again
so
elegantly
please
to
add
a
commentary
the
schoolmaster
replied
grumblingly
to
an
epistle
on
which
erasmus
then
fourteen
years
old
had
expended
much
care
that
the
guardians
sincerely
considered
it
a
work
pleasing
to
god
to
persuade
the
youths
to
enter
a
monastery
can
no
more
be
doubted
than
that
this
was
for
them
the
easiest
way
to
get
rid
of
their
task
for
erasmus
this
pitiful
business
assumes
the
colour
of
a
grossly
selfish
attempt
to
cloak
dishonest
administration
an
altogether
reprehensible
abuse
of
power
and
authority
more
than
this
in
later
years
it
obscured
for
him
the
image
of
his
own
brother
with
whom
he
had
been
on
terms
of
cordial
intimacy
winckel
sent
the
two
young
fellows
and
eighteen
years
old
to
school
again
this
time
at
there
they
lived
in
the
fraterhouse
itself
to
which
the
school
was
attached
there
was
nothing
here
of
the
glory
that
had
shone
about
deventer
the
brethren
says
erasmus
knew
of
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
destroying
all
natural
gifts
with
blows
reprimands
and
severity
in
order
to
fit
the
soul
for
the
monastery
this
he
thought
was
just
what
his
guardians
were
aiming
at
although
ripe
for
the
university
they
were
deliberately
kept
away
from
it
in
this
way
more
than
two
years
were
wasted
one
of
his
two
masters
one
rombout
who
liked
young
erasmus
tried
hard
to
prevail
on
him
to
join
the
brethren
of
the
common
life
in
later
years
erasmus
occasionally
regretted
that
he
had
not
yielded
for
the
brethren
took
no
such
irrevocable
vows
as
were
now
in
store
for
him
an
epidemic
of
the
plague
became
the
occasion
for
the
brothers
to
leave
and
return
to
gouda
erasmus
was
attacked
by
a
fever
that
sapped
his
power
of
resistance
of
which
he
now
stood
in
such
need
the
guardians
one
of
the
three
had
died
in
the
meantime
now
did
their
utmost
to
make
the
two
young
men
enter
a
monastery
they
had
good
cause
for
it
as
they
had
ill
administered
the
slender
fortune
of
their
wards
and
says
erasmus
refused
to
render
an
account
later
he
saw
everything
connected
with
this
dark
period
of
his
life
in
the
most
gloomy
colours
except
himself
himself
he
sees
as
a
boy
of
not
yet
sixteen
years
it
is
nearly
certain
that
he
must
have
been
twenty
already
weakened
by
fever
but
nevertheless
resolute
and
sensible
in
refusing
he
has
persuaded
his
brother
to
fly
with
him
and
to
go
to
a
university
the
one
guardian
is
a
tyrant
the
other
brother
a
merchant
a
frivolous
coaxer
peter
the
elder
of
the
youths
yields
first
and
enters
the
monastery
of
sion
near
delft
of
the
order
of
the
regular
augustinian
canons
where
the
guardian
had
found
a
place
for
him
erasmus
resisted
longer
only
after
a
visit
to
the
monastery
of
steyn
or
emmaus
near
gouda
belonging
to
the
same
order
where
he
found
a
schoolfellow
from
deventer
who
pointed
out
the
bright
side
of
monastic
life
did
erasmus
yield
and
enter
steyn
where
soon
after
probably
in
he
took
the
vows

james
batt
he
gets
leave
to
study
at
paris
in
his
later
life
under
the
influence
of
the
gnawing
regret
which
his
monkhood
and
all
the
trouble
he
took
to
escape
from
it
caused
him
the
picture
of
all
the
events
leading
up
to
his
entering
the
convent
became
distorted
in
his
mind
brother
peter
to
whom
he
still
wrote
in
a
cordial
vein
from
steyn
became
a
worthless
fellow
even
his
evil
spirit
a
judas
the
schoolfellow
whose
advice
had
been
decisive
now
appeared
a
traitor
prompted
by
who
himself
had
chosen
merely
out
of
laziness
and
the
love
of
good
cheer
the
letters
that
erasmus
wrote
from
steyn
betray
no
vestige
of
his
aversion
to
monastic
life
which
afterwards
he
asks
us
to
believe
he
had
felt
from
the
outset
we
may
of
course
assume
that
the
supervision
of
his
superiors
prevented
him
from
writing
all
that
was
in
his
heart
and
that
in
the
depths
of
his
being
there
had
always
existed
the
craving
for
freedom
and
for
more
civilized
intercourse
than
steyn
could
offer
still
he
must
have
found
in
the
monastery
some
of
the
good
things
that
his
schoolfellow
had
led
him
to
expect
that
at
this
period
he
should
have
written
a
of
monastic
life
please
a
friend
who
wanted
to
decoy
a
cousin
as
he
himself
says
is
one
of
those
naïve
assertions
invented
afterwards
of
which
erasmus
never
saw
the
unreasonable
quality
he
found
at
steyn
a
fair
degree
of
freedom
some
food
for
an
intellect
craving
for
classic
antiquity
and
friendships
with
men
of
the
same
turn
of
mind
there
were
three
who
especially
attracted
him
of
the
schoolfellow
who
had
induced
him
to
become
a
monk
we
hear
no
more
his
friends
are
servatius
roger
of
rotterdam
and
william
hermans
of
gouda
both
his
companions
at
steyn
and
the
older
cornelius
gerard
of
gouda
usually
called
aurelius
a
of
goudanus
who
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
monastery
of
lopsen
near
leyden
with
them
he
read
and
conversed
sociably
and
jestingly
with
them
he
exchanged
letters
when
they
were
not
together
out
of
the
letters
to
servatius
there
rises
the
picture
of
an
erasmus
whom
we
shall
never
find
again
a
young
man
of
more
than
feminine
sensitiveness
of
a
languishing
need
for
sentimental
friendship
in
writing
to
servatius
erasmus
runs
the
whole
gamut
of
an
ardent
lover
as
often
as
the
image
of
his
friend
presents
itself
to
his
mind
tears
break
from
his
eyes
weeping
he
his
friend
letter
every
hour
but
he
is
mortally
dejected
and
anxious
for
the
friend
proves
averse
to
this
excessive
attachment
do
you
want
from
me
he
asks
is
wrong
with
you
the
other
replies
erasmus
can
not
bear
to
find
that
this
friendship
is
not
fully
returned
not
be
so
reserved
do
tell
me
what
is
wrong
i
repose
my
hope
in
you
alone
i
have
become
yours
so
completely
that
you
have
left
me
naught
of
myself
you
know
my
pusillanimity
which
when
it
has
no
one
on
whom
to
lean
and
rest
makes
me
so
desperate
that
life
becomes
a
burden
let
us
remember
this
erasmus
never
again
expresses
himself
so
passionately
he
has
given
us
here
the
clue
by
which
we
may
understand
much
of
what
he
becomes
in
his
later
years
these
letters
have
sometimes
been
taken
as
mere
literary
exercises
the
weakness
they
betray
and
the
complete
absence
of
all
reticence
seem
to
tally
ill
with
his
habit
of
cloaking
his
most
intimate
feelings
which
afterwards
erasmus
never
quite
relinquishes
allen
who
leaves
this
question
undecided
nevertheless
inclines
to
regard
the
letters
as
sincere
effusions
and
to
me
they
seem
so
incontestably
this
exuberant
friendship
accords
quite
well
with
the
times
and
the
person
sentimental
friendships
were
as
much
in
vogue
in
secular
circles
during
the
fifteenth
century
as
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
each
court
had
its
pairs
of
friends
who
dressed
alike
and
shared
room
bed
and
heart
nor
was
this
cult
of
fervent
friendship
restricted
to
the
sphere
of
aristocratic
life
it
was
among
the
specific
characteristics
of
the
as
for
the
rest
it
seems
from
its
very
nature
to
be
inseparably
bound
up
with
pietism
to
observe
one
another
with
sympathy
to
watch
and
note
each
other
inner
life
was
a
customary
and
approved
occupation
among
the
brethren
of
the
common
life
and
the
windesheim
monks
and
though
steyn
and
sion
were
not
of
the
windesheim
congregation
the
spirit
of
the
was
prevalent
there
as
for
erasmus
himself
he
has
rarely
revealed
the
foundation
of
his
character
more
completely
than
when
he
declared
to
servatius
mind
is
such
that
i
think
nothing
can
rank
higher
than
friendship
in
this
life
nothing
should
be
desired
more
ardently
nothing
should
be
treasured
more
jealously
a
violent
affection
of
a
similar
nature
troubled
him
even
at
a
later
date
when
the
purity
of
his
motives
was
questioned
afterwards
he
speaks
of
youth
as
being
used
to
conceive
a
fervent
affection
for
certain
comrades
moreover
the
classic
examples
of
friends
orestes
and
pylades
damon
and
pythias
theseus
and
pirithous
as
also
david
and
jonathan
were
ever
present
before
his
mind
eye
a
young
and
very
tender
heart
marked
by
many
feminine
traits
replete
with
all
the
sentiment
and
with
all
the
imaginings
of
classic
literature
who
was
debarred
from
love
and
found
himself
placed
against
his
wish
in
a
coarse
and
frigid
environment
was
likely
to
become
somewhat
excessive
in
his
affections
he
was
obliged
to
moderate
them
servatius
would
have
none
of
so
jealous
and
exacting
a
friendship
and
probably
at
the
cost
of
more
humiliation
and
shame
than
appears
in
his
letters
young
erasmus
resigns
himself
to
be
more
guarded
in
expressing
his
feelings
in
the
future
the
sentimental
erasmus
disappears
for
good
and
presently
makes
room
for
the
witty
latinist
who
surpasses
his
older
friends
and
chats
with
them
about
poetry
and
literature
advises
them
about
their
latin
style
and
lectures
them
if
necessary
the
opportunities
for
acquiring
the
new
taste
for
classic
antiquity
can
not
have
been
so
scanty
at
deventer
and
in
the
monastery
itself
as
erasmus
afterwards
would
have
us
believe
considering
the
authors
he
already
knew
at
this
time
we
may
conjecture
also
that
the
books
left
by
his
father
possibly
brought
by
him
from
italy
contributed
to
erasmus
culture
though
it
would
be
strange
that
prone
as
he
was
to
disparage
his
schools
and
his
monastery
he
should
not
have
mentioned
the
fact
moreover
we
know
that
the
humanistic
knowledge
of
his
youth
was
not
exclusively
his
own
in
spite
of
all
he
afterwards
said
about
dutch
ignorance
and
obscurantism
cornelius
aurelius
and
william
hermans
likewise
possessed
it
in
a
letter
to
cornelius
he
mentions
the
following
authors
as
his
poetic
models
virgil
horace
ovid
juvenal
statius
martial
claudian
persius
lucan
tibullus
propertius
in
prose
he
imitates
cicero
quintilian
sallust
and
terence
whose
metrical
character
had
not
yet
been
recognized
among
italian
humanists
he
was
especially
acquainted
with
lorenzo
valla
who
on
account
of
his
passed
with
him
for
the
pioneer
of
but
filelfo
aeneas
sylvius
guarino
poggio
and
others
were
also
not
unknown
to
him
in
ecclesiastical
literature
he
was
particularly
well
read
in
jerome
it
remains
remarkable
that
the
education
which
erasmus
received
in
the
schools
of
the
with
their
object
their
rigid
discipline
intent
on
breaking
the
personality
could
produce
such
a
mind
as
he
manifests
in
his
monastic
period
the
mind
of
an
accomplished
humanist
he
is
only
interested
in
writing
latin
verses
and
in
the
purity
of
his
latin
style
we
look
almost
in
vain
for
piety
in
the
correspondence
with
cornelius
of
gouda
and
william
hermans
they
manipulate
with
ease
the
most
difficult
latin
metres
and
the
rarest
terms
of
mythology
their
is
bucolic
or
amatory
and
if
devotional
their
classicism
deprives
it
of
the
accent
of
piety
the
prior
of
the
neighbouring
monastery
of
hem
at
whose
request
erasmus
sang
the
archangel
michael
did
not
dare
to
paste
up
his
sapphic
ode
it
was
so
he
thought
as
to
seem
almost
greek
in
those
days
poetic
meant
classic
erasmus
himself
thought
he
had
made
it
so
bald
that
it
was
nearly
prose
times
were
so
barren
then
he
afterwards
sighed
these
young
poets
felt
themselves
the
guardians
of
a
new
light
amidst
the
dullness
and
barbarism
which
oppressed
them
they
readily
believed
each
other
productions
to
be
immortal
as
every
band
of
youthful
poets
does
and
dreamt
of
a
future
of
poetic
glory
for
steyn
by
which
it
would
vie
with
mantua
their
environment
of
clownish
conventional
divines
for
as
such
they
saw
them
neither
acknowledged
nor
encouraged
them
erasmus
strong
propensity
to
fancy
himself
menaced
and
injured
tinged
this
position
with
the
martyrdom
of
oppressed
talent
to
cornelius
he
complains
in
fine
horatian
measure
of
the
contempt
in
which
poetry
was
held
his
orders
him
to
let
his
pen
accustomed
to
writing
poetry
rest
consuming
envy
forces
him
to
give
up
making
verses
a
horrid
barbarism
prevails
the
country
laughs
at
the
art
of
apollo
the
coarse
peasant
orders
the
learned
poet
to
write
verses
i
had
mouths
as
many
as
the
stars
that
twinkle
in
the
silent
firmament
on
quiet
nights
or
as
many
as
the
roses
that
the
mild
gale
of
spring
strews
on
the
ground
i
could
not
complain
of
all
the
evils
by
which
the
sacred
art
of
poetry
is
oppressed
in
these
days
i
am
tired
of
writing
poetry
of
this
effusion
cornelius
made
a
dialogue
which
highly
pleased
erasmus
though
in
this
art
may
be
rhetorical
fiction
and
sedulous
imitation
we
ought
not
on
that
account
to
undervalue
the
enthusiasm
inspiring
the
young
poets
let
us
who
have
mostly
grown
blunt
to
the
charms
of
latin
not
think
too
lightly
of
the
elation
felt
by
one
who
after
learning
this
language
out
of
the
most
absurd
primers
and
according
to
the
most
ridiculous
methods
nevertheless
discovered
it
in
its
purity
and
afterwards
came
to
handle
it
in
the
charming
rhythm
of
some
artful
metre
in
the
glorious
precision
of
its
structure
and
in
all
the
melodiousness
of
its
sound

was
it
strange
that
the
youth
who
could
say
this
felt
himself
a
poet
or
who
together
with
his
friend
could
sing

if
you
like

literary

and
yet
full
of
the
freshness
and
the
vigour
which
spring
from
the
latin
itself
out
of
these
moods
was
to
come
the
first
comprehensive
work
that
erasmus
was
to
undertake
the
manuscript
of
which
he
was
afterwards
to
lose
to
recover
in
part
and
to
publish
only
after
many
years
the
which
he
commenced
at
steyn
according
to
allen
in
the
version
in
which
eventually
the
first
book
of
the
appeared
it
reflects
it
is
true
a
somewhat
later
phase
of
life
that
which
began
after
he
had
left
the
monastery
neither
is
the
comfortable
tone
of
his
witty
defence
of
profane
literature
any
longer
that
of
the
poet
at
steyn
but
the
ideal
of
a
free
and
noble
life
of
friendly
intercourse
and
the
uninterrupted
study
of
the
ancients
had
already
occurred
to
him
within
the
convent
walls
in
the
course
of
years
those
walls
probably
hemmed
him
in
more
and
more
closely
neither
learned
and
poetic
correspondence
nor
the
art
of
painting
with
which
he
occupied
himself
together
with
one
sasboud
could
sweeten
the
oppression
of
monastic
life
and
a
unfriendly
environment
of
the
later
period
of
his
life
in
the
monastery
no
letters
at
all
have
been
preserved
according
to
allen
carefully
considered
dating
had
he
dropped
his
correspondence
out
of
spleen
or
had
his
superiors
forbidden
him
to
keep
it
up
or
are
we
merely
left
in
the
dark
because
of
accidental
loss
we
know
nothing
about
the
circumstances
and
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
erasmus
was
ordained
on
april
by
the
bishop
of
utrecht
david
of
burgundy
perhaps
his
taking
holy
orders
was
connected
with
his
design
to
leave
the
monastery
he
himself
afterwards
declared
that
he
had
but
rarely
read
mass
he
got
his
chance
to
leave
the
monastery
when
offered
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
bishop
of
cambray
henry
of
bergen
erasmus
owed
this
preferment
to
his
fame
as
a
latinist
and
a
man
of
letters
for
it
was
with
a
view
to
a
journey
to
rome
where
the
bishop
hoped
to
obtain
a
cardinal
hat
that
erasmus
entered
his
service
the
authorization
of
the
bishop
of
utrecht
had
been
obtained
and
also
that
of
the
prior
and
the
general
of
the
order
of
course
there
was
no
question
yet
of
taking
leave
for
good
since
as
the
bishop
servant
erasmus
continued
to
wear
his
canon
dress
he
had
prepared
for
his
departure
in
the
deepest
secrecy
there
is
something
touching
in
the
glimpse
we
get
of
his
friend
and
william
hermans
waiting
in
vain
outside
of
gouda
to
see
his
friend
just
for
a
moment
when
on
his
way
south
he
would
pass
the
town
it
seems
there
had
been
consultations
between
them
as
to
leaving
steyn
together
and
erasmus
on
his
part
had
left
him
ignorant
of
his
plans
william
had
to
console
himself
with
the
literature
that
might
be
had
at
steyn
erasmus
then
years
old
for
in
all
probability
the
year
when
he
left
the
monastery
was
now
set
foot
on
the
path
of
a
career
that
was
very
common
and
much
coveted
at
that
time
that
of
an
intellectual
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
his
patron
belonged
to
one
of
the
numerous
belgian
noble
families
which
had
risen
in
the
service
of
the
burgundians
and
were
interestedly
devoted
to
the
prosperity
of
that
house
the
glimes
were
lords
of
the
important
town
of
which
situated
between
the
river
scheldt
and
the
meuse
delta
was
one
of
the
links
between
the
northern
and
the
southern
netherlands
henry
the
bishop
of
cambray
had
just
been
appointed
chancellor
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
the
most
distinguished
spiritual
dignity
at
court
which
although
now
habsburg
in
fact
was
still
named
after
burgundy
the
service
of
such
an
important
personage
promised
almost
unbounded
honour
and
profit
many
a
man
would
under
the
circumstances
at
the
cost
of
some
patience
some
humiliation
and
a
certain
laxity
of
principle
have
risen
even
to
be
a
bishop
but
erasmus
was
never
a
man
to
make
the
most
of
his
situation
serving
the
bishop
proved
to
be
rather
a
disappointment
erasmus
had
to
accompany
him
on
his
frequent
migrations
from
one
residence
to
another
in
bergen
brussels
or
mechlin
he
was
very
busy
but
the
exact
nature
of
his
duties
is
unknown
the
journey
to
rome
the
acme
of
things
desirable
to
every
divine
or
student
did
not
come
off
the
bishop
although
taking
a
cordial
interest
in
him
for
some
months
was
less
accommodating
than
he
had
expected
and
so
we
shortly
find
erasmus
once
more
in
anything
but
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
hardest
fate
he
calls
his
own
which
robs
him
of
all
his
old
sprightliness
opportunities
to
study
he
has
none
he
now
envies
his
friend
william
who
at
steyn
in
the
little
cell
can
write
beautiful
poetry
favoured
by
his
stars
it
befits
him
erasmus
only
to
weep
and
sigh
it
has
already
so
dulled
his
mind
and
withered
his
heart
that
his
former
studies
no
longer
appeal
to
him
there
is
rhetorical
exaggeration
in
this
and
we
shall
not
take
his
pining
for
the
monastery
too
seriously
but
still
it
is
clear
that
deep
dejection
had
mastered
him
contact
with
the
world
of
politics
and
ambition
had
probably
unsettled
erasmus
he
never
had
any
aptitude
for
it
the
hard
realities
of
life
frightened
and
distressed
him
when
forced
to
occupy
himself
with
them
he
saw
nothing
but
bitterness
and
confusion
about
him
is
gladness
or
repose
wherever
i
turn
my
eyes
i
only
see
disaster
and
harshness
and
in
such
a
bustle
and
clamour
about
me
you
wish
me
to
find
leisure
for
the
work
of
the
muses
real
leisure
erasmus
was
never
to
find
during
his
life
all
his
reading
all
his
writing
he
did
hastily
as
he
calls
it
repeatedly
yet
he
must
nevertheless
have
worked
with
intensest
concentration
and
an
incredible
power
of
assimilation
whilst
staying
with
the
bishop
he
visited
the
monastery
of
groenendael
near
brussels
where
in
former
times
ruysbroeck
wrote
possibly
erasmus
did
not
hear
the
inmates
speak
of
ruysbroeck
and
he
would
certainly
have
taken
little
pleasure
in
the
writings
of
the
great
mystic
but
in
the
library
he
found
the
works
of
augustine
and
these
he
devoured
the
monks
of
groenendael
were
surprised
at
his
diligence
he
took
the
volumes
with
him
even
to
his
bedroom
he
occasionally
found
time
to
compose
at
this
period
at
halsteren
near
where
the
bishop
had
a
country
house
he
revised
the
begun
at
steyn
and
elaborated
it
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
it
would
seem
as
if
he
sought
compensation
for
the
agitation
of
his
existence
in
an
atmosphere
of
idyllic
repose
and
cultured
conversation
he
conveys
us
to
the
scene
he
will
afterwards
use
it
repeatedly
which
ever
remained
the
ideal
pleasure
of
life
to
him
a
garden
or
a
garden

outside
the
town
where
in
the
gladness
of
a
fine
day
a
small
number
of
friends
meet
to
talk
during
a
simple
meal
or
a
quiet
walk
in
platonic
serenity
about
things
of
the
mind
the
personages
whom
he
introduces

and

latin
style
and
the
taste
for
classic
poetry
here
too
had
their
fervent
champions
just
as
revived
platonism
which
had
sprung
up
in
italy
the
parisian
humanists
were
partly
italians
as
girolamo
balbi
and
fausto
andrelini
but
at
that
time
a
frenchman
was
considered
to
be
their
leader
robert
gaguin
general
of
the
order
of
the
mathurins
or
trinitarians
diplomatist
french
poet
and
humanist
side
by
side
with
the
new
platonism
a
clearer
understanding
of
aristotle
penetrated
which
had
also
come
from
italy
shortly
before
erasmus
arrival
jacques
lefèvre
had
returned
from
italy
where
he
had
visited
the
platonists
such
as
marsilio
ficino
pico
della
mirandola
and
ermolao
barbaro
the
reviver
of
aristotle
though
theoretical
theology
and
philosophy
generally
were
conservative
at
paris
yet
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
movements
to
reform
the
church
were
not
wanting
the
authority
of
jean
gerson
the
university
great
chancellor
about
had
not
yet
been
forgotten
but
reform
by
no
means
meant
inclination
to
depart
from
the
doctrine
of
the
church
it
aimed
in
the
first
place
at
restoration
and
purification
of
the
monastic
orders
and
afterwards
at
the
extermination
of
abuses
which
the
church
acknowledged
and
lamented
as
existing
within
its
fold
in
that
spirit
of
reformation
of
spiritual
life
the
dutch
movement
of
the
had
recently
begun
to
make
itself
felt
also
at
paris
the
chief
of
its
promoters
was
john
standonck
of
mechlin
educated
by
the
brethren
of
the
common
life
at
gouda
and
imbued
with
their
spirit
in
its
most
rigorous
form
he
was
an
ascetic
more
austere
than
the
spirit
of
the
windesheimians
strict
indeed
but
yet
moderate
required
far
beyond
ecclesiastical
circles
his
name
was
proverbial
on
account
of
his
abstinence
he
had
definitely
denied
himself
the
use
of
meat
as
provisor
of
the
college
of
montaigu
he
had
instituted
the
most
stringent
rules
there
enforced
by
chastisement
for
the
slightest
faults
to
the
college
he
had
annexed
a
home
for
poor
scholars
where
they
lived
in
a
community
to
this
man
erasmus
had
been
recommended
by
the
bishop
of
cambray
though
he
did
not
join
the
community
of
poor
students
he
was
nearly
thirty
years
old
he
came
to
know
all
the
privations
of
the
system
they
embittered
the
earlier
part
of
his
stay
at
paris
and
instilled
in
him
a
deep
permanent
aversion
to
abstinence
and
austerity
had
he
come
to
paris
for
this
to
experience
the
dismal
and
depressing
influences
of
his
youth
anew
in
a
more
stringent
form
the
purpose
for
which
erasmus
went
to
paris
was
chiefly
to
obtain
the
degree
of
doctor
of
theology
this
was
not
too
difficult
for
him
as
a
regular
he
was
exempt
from
previous
study
in
the
faculty
of
arts
and
his
learning
and
astonishing
intelligence
and
energy
enabled
him
to
prepare
in
a
short
time
for
the
examinations
and
disputations
required
yet
he
did
not
attain
this
object
at
paris
his
stay
which
with
interruptions
lasted
first
till
to
be
continued
later
became
to
him
a
period
of
difficulties
and
exasperations
of
struggle
to
make
his
way
by
all
the
humiliating
means
which
at
the
time
were
indispensable
to
that
end
of
dawning
success
too
which
however
failed
to
gratify
him
the
first
cause
of
his
reverses
was
a
physical
one
he
could
not
endure
the
hard
life
in
the
college
of
montaigu
the
addled
eggs
and
squalid
bedrooms
stuck
in
his
memory
all
his
life
there
he
thinks
he
contracted
the
beginnings
of
his
later
infirmity
in
the
he
has
commemorated
with
abhorrence
standonck
system
of
abstinence
privation
and
chastisement
for
the
rest
his
stay
there
lasted
only
until
the
spring
of
meanwhile
he
had
begun
his
theological
studies
he
attended
lectures
on
the
bible
and
on
the
book
of
the
sentences
the
medieval
handbook
of
theology
and
still
the
one
most
frequently
used
he
was
even
allowed
to
give
some
lessons
in
the
college
on
holy
scripture
he
preached
a
few
sermons
in
honour
of
the
saints
probably
in
the
neighbouring
abbey
of
geneviève
but
his
heart
was
not
in
all
this
the
subtleties
of
the
schools
could
not
please
him
that
aversion
to
all
scholasticism
which
he
rejected
in
one
sweeping
condemnation
struck
root
in
his
mind
which
however
broad
always
judged
unjustly
that
for
which
it
had
no
room
studies
can
make
a
man
opinionated
and
contentious
can
they
make
him
wise
they
exhaust
the
mind
by
a
certain
jejune
and
barren
subtlety
without
fertilizing
or
inspiring
it
by
their
stammering
and
by
the
stains
of
their
impure
style
they
disfigure
theology
which
had
been
enriched
and
adorned
by
the
eloquence
of
the
ancients
they
involve
everything
whilst
trying
to
resolve
everything
with
erasmus
became
a
handy
epithet
for
all
schoolmen
nay
for
everything
superannuated
and
antiquated
he
would
rather
lose
the
whole
of
scotus
than
cicero
or
plutarch
works
these
he
feels
the
better
for
reading
whereas
he
rises
from
the
study
of
scholasticism
frigidly
disposed
towards
true
virtue
but
irritated
into
a
disputatious
mood
it
would
no
doubt
have
been
difficult
for
erasmus
to
find
in
the
arid
traditionalism
which
prevailed
in
the
university
of
paris
the
heyday
of
scholastic
philosophy
and
theology
from
the
disputations
which
he
heard
in
the
sorbonne
he
brought
back
nothing
but
the
habit
of
scoffing
at
doctors
of
theology
or
as
he
always
ironically
calls
them
by
their
title
of
honour
yawning
he
sat
among
holy
scotists
with
their
wrinkled
brows
staring
eyes
and
puzzled
faces
and
on
his
return
home
he
writes
a
disrespectful
fantasy
to
his
young
friend
thomas
grey
telling
him
how
he
sleeps
the
sleep
of
epimenides
with
the
divines
of
the
sorbonne
epimenides
awoke
after
his
years
of
slumber
but
the
majority
of
our
present
theologians
will
never
wake
up
what
may
epimenides
have
dreamt
what
but
subtleties
of
the
scotists
quiddities
formalities
epimenides
himself
was
reborn
in
scotus
or
rather
epimenides
was
scotus
prototype
for
did
not
he
too
write
theological
books
in
which
he
tied
such
syllogistic
knots
as
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
loosen
the
sorbonne
preserves
epimenides
skin
written
over
with
mysterious
letters
as
an
oracle
which
men
may
only
see
after
having
borne
the
title
of
for
fifteen
years
it
is
not
a
far
cry
from
caricatures
like
these
to
the
and
the
of
rabelais
is
said
thus
erasmus
concludes
his
no
one
can
understand
the
mysteries
of
this
science
who
has
had
the
least
intercourse
with
the
muses
or
the
graces
all
that
you
have
learned
in
the
way
of
has
to
be
unlearned
first
if
you
have
drunk
of
helicon
you
must
first
vomit
the
draught
i
do
my
utmost
to
say
nothing
according
to
the
latin
taste
and
nothing
graceful
or
witty
and
i
am
already
making
progress
and
there
is
hope
that
one
day
they
will
acknowledge
erasmus
it
was
not
only
the
dryness
of
the
method
and
the
barrenness
of
the
system
which
revolted
erasmus
it
was
also
the
qualities
of
his
own
mind
which
in
spite
of
all
its
breadth
and
acuteness
did
not
tend
to
penetrate
deeply
into
philosophical
or
dogmatic
speculations
for
it
was
not
only
scholasticism
that
repelled
him
the
youthful
platonism
and
the
rejuvenated
aristotelianism
taught
by
lefèvre
also
failed
to
attract
him
for
the
present
he
remained
a
humanist
of
aesthetic
bias
with
the
substratum
of
a
biblical
and
moral
disposition
resting
mainly
on
the
study
of
his
favourite
jerome
for
a
long
time
to
come
erasmus
considered
himself
and
also
introduced
himself
as
a
poet
and
an
orator
by
which
latter
term
he
meant
what
we
call
a
man
of
letters
immediately
on
arriving
at
paris
he
must
have
sought
contact
with
the
headquarters
of
literary
humanism
the
obscure
dutch
regular
introduced
himself
in
a
long
letter
not
preserved
full
of
eulogy
accompanied
by
a
poem
to
the
general
not
only
of
the
trinitarians
but
at
the
same
time
of
parisian
humanists
robert
gaguin
the
great
man
answered
very
obligingly
your
lyrical
specimen
i
conclude
that
you
are
a
scholar
my
friendship
is
at
your
disposal
do
not
be
so
profuse
in
your
praise
that
looks
like
flattery
the
correspondence
had
hardly
begun
when
erasmus
found
a
splendid
opportunity
to
render
this
illustrious
personage
a
service
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
shadow
of
his
name
make
himself
known
to
the
reading
public
the
matter
is
also
of
importance
because
it
affords
us
an
opportunity
for
the
first
time
to
notice
the
connection
that
is
always
found
between
erasmus
career
as
a
man
of
letters
and
a
scholar
and
the
technical
conditions
of
the
youthful
art
of
printing
gaguin
was
an
man
and
his
latin
of
the
history
of
france
origine
et
gestis
francorum
was
just
being
printed
it
was
the
first
specimen
of
humanistic
historiography
in
france
the
printer
had
finished
his
work
on
september
but
of
the
leaves
two
remained
blank
this
was
not
permissible
according
to
the
notions
of
that
time
gaguin
was
ill
and
could
not
help
matters
by
judicious
spacing
the
compositor
managed
to
fill
up
folio
with
a
poem
by
gaguin
the
colophon
and
two
panegyrics
by
faustus
andrelinus
and
another
humanist
even
then
there
was
need
of
matter
and
erasmus
dashed
into
the
breach
and
furnished
a
long
commendatory
letter
completely
filling
the
superfluous
blank
space
of
folio
in
this
way
his
name
and
style
suddenly
became
known
to
the
numerous
public
which
was
interested
in
gaguin
historical
work
and
at
the
same
time
he
acquired
another
title
to
gaguin
protection
on
whom
the
exceptional
qualities
of
erasmus
diction
had
evidently
not
been
lost
that
his
history
would
remain
known
chiefly
because
it
had
been
a
stepping
stone
to
erasmus
gaguin
could
hardly
have
anticipated
although
erasmus
had
now
as
a
follower
of
gaguin
been
introduced
into
the
world
of
parisian
humanists
the
road
to
fame
which
had
latterly
begun
to
lead
through
the
printing
press
was
not
yet
easy
for
him
he
showed
the
to
gaguin
who
praised
them
but
no
suggestion
of
publication
resulted
a
slender
volume
of
latin
poems
by
erasmus
was
published
in
paris
in
dedicated
to
hector
boys
a
scotchman
with
whom
he
had
become
acquainted
at
montaigu
but
the
more
important
writings
at
which
he
worked
during
his
stay
in
paris
all
appeared
in
print
much
later
while
intercourse
with
men
like
robert
gaguin
and
faustus
andrelinus
might
be
honourable
it
was
not
directly
profitable
the
support
of
the
bishop
of
cambray
was
scantier
than
he
wished
in
the
spring
of
he
fell
ill
and
left
paris
going
first
to
bergen
he
had
a
kind
welcome
from
his
patron
the
bishop
and
then
having
recovered
his
health
he
went
on
to
holland
to
his
friends
it
was
his
intention
to
stay
there
he
says
the
friends
themselves
however
urged
him
to
return
to
paris
which
he
did
in
the
autumn
of
he
carried
poetry
by
william
hermans
and
a
letter
from
this
poet
to
gaguin
a
printer
was
found
for
the
poems
and
erasmus
also
brought
his
friend
and
into
contact
with
faustus
andrelinus
the
position
of
a
man
who
wished
to
live
by
intellectual
labour
was
far
from
easy
at
that
time
and
not
always
dignified
he
had
either
to
live
on
church
prebends
or
on
distinguished
patrons
or
on
both
but
such
a
prebend
was
difficult
to
get
and
patrons
were
uncertain
and
often
disappointing
the
publishers
paid
considerable
only
to
famous
authors
as
a
rule
the
writer
received
a
number
of
copies
of
his
work
and
that
was
all
his
chief
advantage
came
from
a
dedication
to
some
distinguished
personage
who
could
compliment
him
for
it
with
a
handsome
gift
there
were
authors
who
made
it
a
practice
to
dedicate
the
same
work
repeatedly
to
different
persons
erasmus
has
afterwards
defended
himself
explicitly
from
that
suspicion
and
carefully
noted
how
many
of
those
whom
he
honoured
with
a
dedication
gave
nothing
or
very
little
the
first
need
therefore
to
a
man
in
erasmus
circumstances
was
to
find
a
maecenas
maecenas
with
the
humanists
was
almost
synonymous
with
paymaster
under
the
adage
bos
quidem
erasmus
has
given
a
description
of
the
decent
way
of
obtaining
a
maecenas
consequently
when
his
conduct
in
these
years
appears
to
us
to
be
actuated
more
than
once
by
an
undignified
pushing
spirit
we
should
not
gauge
it
by
our
present
standards
these
were
his
years
of
weakness
on
his
return
to
paris
he
did
not
again
lodge
in
montaigu
he
tried
to
make
a
living
by
giving
lessons
to
young
men
of
fortune
a
sons
of
lübeck
christian
and
henry
northoff
who
lodged
with
one
augustine
vincent
were
his
pupils
he
composed
beautiful
letters
for
them
witty
fluent
and
a
trifle
scented
at
the
same
time
he
taught
two
young
englishmen
thomas
grey
and
robert
fisher
and
conceived
such
a
doting
affection
for
grey
as
to
lead
to
trouble
with
the
guardian
a
scotchman
by
whom
erasmus
was
excessively
vexed
paris
did
not
fail
to
exercise
its
refining
influence
on
erasmus
it
made
his
style
affectedly
refined
and
sparkling
he
pretends
to
disdain
the
rustic
products
of
his
youth
in
holland
in
the
meantime
the
works
through
which
afterwards
his
influence
was
to
spread
over
the
whole
world
began
to
grow
but
only
to
the
benefit
of
a
few
readers
they
remained
unprinted
as
yet
for
the
northoffs
was
composed
the
little
compendium
of
polite
conversation
in
latin
colloquiorum
the
nucleus
of
the
for
robert
fisher
he
wrote
the
first
draft
of
conscribendis
the
great
dissertation
on
the
art
of
latin
letters
probably
also
the
paraphrase
of
valla
a
treatise
on
pure
latin
which
had
been
a
of
culture
to
erasmus
in
his
youth
copia
verborum
ac
was
also
such
a
help
for
beginners
to
provide
them
with
a
vocabulary
and
abundance
of
turns
and
expressions
and
also
the
germs
of
a
larger
work
ratione
a
manual
for
arranging
courses
of
study
lay
in
the
same
line
it
was
a
life
of
uncertainty
and
unrest
the
bishop
gave
but
little
support
erasmus
was
not
in
good
health
and
felt
continually
depressed
he
made
plans
for
a
journey
to
italy
but
did
not
see
much
chance
of
effecting
them
in
the
summer
of
he
again
travelled
to
holland
and
to
the
bishop
in
holland
his
friends
were
little
pleased
with
his
studies
it
was
feared
that
he
was
contracting
debts
at
paris
current
reports
about
him
were
not
favourable
he
found
the
bishop
in
the
commotion
of
his
departure
for
england
on
a
mission
irritable
and
full
of
complaints
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
he
would
have
to
look
out
for
another
patron
perhaps
he
might
turn
to
the
lady
of
veere
anna
of
borselen
with
whom
his
faithful
and
helpful
friend
batt
had
now
taken
service
as
a
tutor
to
her
son
in
the
castle
of
tournehem
between
calais
and
saint
omer
upon
his
return
to
paris
erasmus
resumed
his
old
life
but
it
was
hateful
slavery
to
him
batt
had
an
invitation
for
him
to
come
to
tournehem
but
he
could
not
yet
bear
to
leave
paris
here
he
had
now
as
a
pupil
the
young
lord
mountjoy

the

he
worked
hard

writings
on
which
he
was
engaged
as
hard
as
his
health
permitted
after
the
difficult
journey
in

he
was
busily
occupied
in
collecting
the
money
for
travelling
to
italy
now
postponed
until
august
but
evidently
batt
could
not
obtain
as
much
for
him
as
he
had
hoped
and
in
may
erasmus
suddenly
gave
up
the
italian
plan
and
left
for

first

which
lasted
from
the
early
summer
of
till
the
beginning
of
was
to
become
for
him
a
period
of
inward
ripening
he
came
there
as
an
erudite
poet
the
protégé
of
a
nobleman
of
rank
on
the
road
to
closer
contact
with
the
great
world
which
knew
how
to
appreciate
and
reward
literary
merit
he
left
the
country
with
the
fervent
desire
in
future
to
employ
his
gifts
in
so
far
as
circumstances
would
permit
in
more
serious
tasks
this
change
was
brought
about
by
two
new
friends
whom
he
found
in
england
whose
personalities
were
far
above
those
who
had
hitherto
crossed
his
path
john
colet
and
thomas
more
during
all
the
time
of
his
sojourn
in
england
erasmus
is
in
high
spirits
for
him
at
first
it
is
still
the
man
of
the
world
who
speaks
the
refined
man
of
letters
who
must
needs
show
his
brilliant
genius
aristocratic
life
of
which
he
evidently
had
seen
but
little
at
the
bishop
of
cambray
and
the
lady
of

at
tournehem
pleased
him
fairly
well
it
seems
in
england
he
writes
in
a
light
vein

faustus
andrelinus
have
indeed
progressed
somewhat
the
erasmus
whom
you
know
is
almost
a
good
hunter
already
not
too
bad
a
horseman
a
not
unpractised
courtier
he
salutes
a
little
more
courteously
he
smiles
more
kindly
if
you
are
wise
you
also
will
alight
here
and
he
teases
the
volatile
poet
by
telling
him
about
the
charming
girls
and
the
laudable
custom
which
he
found
in
england
of
accompanying
all
compliments
by
kisses
it
even
fell
to
his
lot
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
royalty
from
mountjoy
estate
at
greenwich
more
in
the
course
of
a
walk
took
him
to
eltham
palace
where
the
royal
children
were
educated
there
he
saw
surrounded
by
the
whole
royal
household
the
youthful
henry
who
was
to
be
henry
viii
a
boy
of
nine
years
together
with
two
little
sisters
and
a
young
prince
who
was
still
an
infant
in
arms
erasmus
was
ashamed
that
he
had
nothing
to
offer
and
on
returning
home
he
composed
not
without
exertion
for
he
had
not
written
poetry
at
all
for
some
time
a
panegyric
on
england
which
he
presented
to
the
prince
with
a
graceful
dedication
in
october
erasmus
was
at
oxford
which
at
first
did
not
please
him
but
whither
mountjoy
was
to
follow
him
he
had
been
recommended
to
john
colet
who
declared
that
he
required
no
recommendations
he
already
knew
erasmus
from
the
letter
to
gaguin
in
the
latter
historical
work
and
thought
very
highly
of
his
learning
there
followed
during
the
remainder
of
erasmus
stay
at
oxford
a
lively
intercourse
in
conversation
and
in
correspondence
which
definitely
decided
the
bent
of
mind

dean

john
colet
who
did
not
differ
much
from
erasmus
in
point
of
age
had
found
his
intellectual
path
earlier
and
more
easily
born
of
parents
his
father
was
a
london
magistrate
and
twice
lord
mayor
he
had
been
able
leisurely
to
prosecute
his
studies
not
seduced
by
quite
such
a
brilliant
genius
as
erasmus
possessed
into
literary
digressions
he
had
from
the
beginning
fixed
his
attention
on
theology
he
knew
plato
and
plotinus
though
not
in
greek
was
very
well
read
in
the
older
fathers
and
also
respectably
acquainted
with
scholasticism
not
to
mention
his
knowledge
of
mathematics
law
history
and
the
english
poets
in
he
had
established
himself
at
oxford
without
possessing
a
degree
in
divinity
he
expounded
paul
epistles
although
owing
to
his
ignorance
of
greek
he
was
restricted
to
the
vulgate
he
tried
to
penetrate
to
the
original
meaning
of
the
sacred
texts
discarding
the
later
commentaries
colet
had
a
deeply
serious
nature
always
warring
against
the
tendencies
of
his
vigorous
being
and
he
kept
within
bounds
his
pride
and
the
love
of
pleasure
he
had
a
keen
sense
of
humour
which
without
doubt
endeared
him
to
erasmus
he
was
an
enthusiast
when
defending
a
point
in
theology
his
ardour
changed
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
lofty
spirit
permeated
his
whole
person
illustration
iv
sir
thomas
more
out
of
his
intercourse
with
colet
came
the
first
of
theological
writings
at
the
end
of
a
discussion
regarding
agony
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
in
which
erasmus
had
defended
the
usual
view
that
christ
fear
of
suffering
proceeded
from
his
human
nature
colet
had
exhorted
him
to
think
further
about
the
matter
they
exchanged
letters
about
it
and
finally
erasmus
committed
both
their
opinions
to
paper
in
the
form
of
a
disputation
concerning
the
anguish
fear
and
sadness
of
jesus
de
tedio
pavore
tristicia
being
an
elaboration
of
these
letters
while
the
tone
of
this
pamphlet
is
earnest
and
pious
it
is
not
truly
fervent
the
man
of
letters
is
not
at
once
and
completely
superseded
colet
thus
erasmus
ends
his
first
letter
referring
half
ironically
to
himself
i
can
observe
the
rules
of
propriety
in
concluding
such
a
theologic
disputation
with
poetic
fables
he
had
made
use
of
a
few
mythologic
metaphors
but
as
horace
says
expellas
furca
tamen
usque
this
ambiguous
position
which
erasmus
still
occupied
also
in
things
of
the
mind
appears
still
more
clearly
from
the
report
which
he
sent
to
his
new
friend
the
frisian
john
sixtin
a
latin
poet
like
himself
of
another
disputation
with
colet
at
a
repast
probably
in
the
hall
of
magdalen
college
where
wolsey
too
was
perhaps
present
to
his
erasmus
writes
as
a
poet
loosely
and
with
some
affectation
it
was
a
meal
such
as
he
liked
and
afterwards
frequently
pictured
in
his
cultured
company
good
food
moderate

colet
presided
on
his
right
hand
sat
the
prior
charnock
of

erasmus
resided

had
also
been
present
at
the
disputation
about

his
left
was
a
divine
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
an
advocate
of
scholasticism
next
to
him
came
erasmus
the
poet
should
not
be
wanting
at
the
banquet
the
discussion
was
about
cain
guilt
by
which
he
displeased
the
lord
colet
defended
the
opinion
that
cain
had
injured
god
by
doubting
the
creator
goodness
and
in
reliance
on
his
own
industry
tilling
the
earth
whereas
abel
tended
the
sheep
and
was
content
with
what
grew
of
itself
the
divine
contended
with
syllogisms
erasmus
with
arguments
of
but
colet
kindled
and
got
the
better
of
both
after
a
while
when
the
dispute
had
lasted
long
enough
and
had
become
more
serious
than
was
suitable
for
i
said
in
order
to
play
my
part
the
part
of
the
poet
that
is
to
abate
the
contention
and
at
the
same
time
cheer
the
meal
with
a
pleasant
tale
it
is
a
very
old
story
it
has
to
be
unearthed
from
the
very
oldest
authors
i
will
tell
you
what
i
found
about
it
in
literature
if
you
will
promise
me
first
that
you
will
not
look
upon
it
as
a
fable
and
now
he
relates
a
witty
story
of
some
very
ancient
codex
in
which
he
had
read
how
cain
who
had
often
heard
his
parents
speak
of
the
glorious
vegetation
of
paradise
where
the
ears
of
corn
were
as
high
as
the
alders
with
us
had
prevailed
upon
the
angel
who
guarded
it
to
give
him
some
paradisal
grains
god
would
not
mind
it
if
only
he
left
the
apples
alone
the
speech
by
which
the
angel
is
incited
to
disobey
the
almighty
is
a
masterpiece
of
erasmian
wit
you
find
it
pleasant
to
stand
there
by
the
gate
with
a
big
sword
we
have
just
begun
to
use
dogs
for
that
sort
of
work
it
is
not
so
bad
on
earth
and
it
will
be
better
still
we
shall
learn
no
doubt
to
cure
diseases
what
that
forbidden
knowledge
matters
i
do
not
see
very
clearly
though
in
that
matter
too
unwearied
industry
surmounts
all
obstacles
in
this
way
the
guardian
is
seduced
but
when
god
beholds
the
miraculous
effect
of
cain
agricultural
management
punishment
does
not
fail
to
ensue
a
more
delicate
way
of
combining
genesis
and
the
prometheus
myth
no
humanist
had
yet
invented
but
still
though
erasmus
went
on
conducting
himself
as
a
man
of
letters
among
his
his
heart
was
no
longer
in
those
literary
exercises
it
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
erasmus
mental
growth
that
it
records
no
violent
crises
we
never
find
him
engaged
in
those
bitter
inward
struggles
which
are
in
the
experience
of
so
many
great
minds
his
transition
from
interest
in
literary
matters
to
interest
in
religious
matters
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
process
of
conversion
there
is
no
tarsus
in
erasmus
life
the
transition
takes
place
gradually
and
is
never
complete
for
many
years
to
come
erasmus
can
without
suspicion
of
hypocrisy
at
pleasure
as
his
interests
or
his
moods
require
play
the
man
of
letters
or
the
theologian
he
is
a
man
with
whom
the
deeper
currents
of
the
soul
gradually
rise
to
the
surface
who
raises
himself
to
the
height
of
his
ethical
consciousness
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
rather
than
at
the
spur
of
some
irresistible
impulse
the
desire
to
turn
only
to
matters
of
faith
he
shows
early
have
resolved
he
writes
in
his
monastic
period
to
cornelius
of
gouda
write
no
more
poems
in
the
future
except
such
as
savour
of
praise
of
the
saints
or
of
sanctity
itself
but
that
was
the
youthful
pious
resolve
of
a
moment
during
all
the
years
previous
to
the
first
voyage
to
england
erasmus
writings
and
especially
his
letters
betray
a
worldly
disposition
it
only
leaves
him
in
moments
of
illness
and
weariness
then
the
world
displeases
him
and
he
despises
his
own
ambition
he
desires
to
live
in
holy
quiet
musing
on
scripture
and
shedding
tears
over
his
old
errors
but
these
are
utterances
inspired
by
the
occasion
which
one
should
not
take
too
seriously
it
was
colet
word
and
example
which
first
changed
erasmus
desultory
occupation
with
theological
studies
into
a
firm
and
lasting
resolve
to
make
their
pursuit
the
object
of
his
life
colet
urged
him
to
expound
the
pentateuch
or
the
prophet
isaiah
at
oxford
just
as
he
himself
treated
of
paul
epistles
erasmus
declined
he
could
not
do
it
this
bespoke
insight
and
by
which
he
surpassed
colet
the
latter
intuitive
scripture
interpretation
without
knowledge
of
the
original
language
failed
to
satisfy
erasmus
are
acting
imprudently
my
dear
colet
in
trying
to
obtain
water
from
a
in
the
words
of
plautus
how
shall
i
be
so
impudent
as
to
teach
that
which
i
have
not
learned
myself
how
shall
i
warm
others
while
shivering
and
trembling
with
cold
you
complain
that
you
find
yourself
deceived
in
your
expectations
regarding
me
but
i
have
never
promised
you
such
a
thing
you
have
deceived
yourself
by
refusing
to
believe
me
when
i
was
telling
you
the
truth
regarding
myself
neither
did
i
come
here
to
teach
poetics
or
rhetoric
colet
had
hinted
at
that
these
have
ceased
to
be
sweet
to
me
since
they
ceased
to
be
necessary
to
me
i
decline
the
one
task
because
it
does
not
come
up
to
my
aim
in
life
the
other
because
it
is
beyond
my
strength
but
when
one
day
i
shall
be
conscious
that
the
necessary
power
is
in
me
i
too
shall
choose
your
part
and
devote
to
the
assertion
of
divinity
if
no
excellent
yet
sincere
labour
the
inference
which
erasmus
drew
first
of
all
was
that
he
should
know
greek
better
than
he
had
thus
far
been
able
to
learn
it
meanwhile
his
stay
in
england
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
he
had
to
return
to
paris
towards
the
end
of
his
sojourn
he
wrote
to
his
former
pupil
robert
fisher
who
was
in
italy
in
a
tone
about
the
satisfaction
which
he
experienced
in
england
a
most
pleasant
and
wholesome
climate
he
was
most
sensitive
to
it
so
much
humanity
and
erudition
not
of
the
and
trivial
sort
but
of
the
recondite
genuine
ancient
latin
and
greek
stamp
that
he
need
hardly
any
more
long
to
go
to
italy
in
colet
he
thought
he
heard
plato
himself
grocyn
the
grecian
scholar
linacre
the
learned
physician
who
would
not
admire
them
and
whose
spirit
was
ever
softer
sweeter
or
happier
than
that
of
thomas
more
a
disagreeable
incident
occurred
as
erasmus
was
leaving
english
soil
in
january
unfortunately
it
not
only
obscured
his
pleasant
memories
of
the
happy
island
but
also
placed
another
obstacle
in
the
path
of
his
career
and
left
in
his
supersensitive
soul
a
sting
which
vexed
him
for
years
afterwards
the
livelihood
which
he
had
been
gaining
at
paris
of
late
years
was
precarious
the
support
from
the
bishop
had
probably
been
withdrawn
that
of
anna
of
veere
had
trickled
but
languidly
he
could
not
too
firmly
rely
on
mountjoy
under
these
circumstances
a
modest
fund
some
provision
against
a
rainy
day
was
of
the
highest
consequence
such
savings
he
brought
from
england
twenty
pounds
an
act
of
edward
iii
by
henry
vii
not
long
before
prohibited
the
export
of
gold
and
silver
but
more
and
mountjoy
had
assured
erasmus
that
he
could
safely
take
his
money
with
him
if
only
it
was
not
in
english
coin
at
dover
he
learned
that
the
officers
were
of
a
different
opinion
he
might
only
keep
six
the
rest
was
left
behind
in
the
hands
of
the
officials
and
was
evidently
confiscated
the
shock
which
this
incident
gave
him
perhaps
contributed
to
his
fancying
himself
threatened
by
robbers
and
murderers
on
the
road
from
calais
to
paris
the
loss
of
his
money
plunged
him
afresh
into
perplexity
as
to
his
support
from
day
to
day
it
forced
him
to
resume
the
profession
of
a
which
he
already
began
to
loathe
and
to
take
all
the
humiliating
steps
to
get
what
was
due
to
it
from
patrons
and
above
all
it
affected
his
mental
balance
and
his
dignity
yet
this
mishap
had
its
great
advantage
for
the
world
and
for
erasmus
too
after
all
to
it
the
world
owes
the
and
he
the
fame
which
began
with
this
work
the
feelings
with
which
his
misfortune
at
dover
inspired
erasmus
were
bitter
anger
and
thirst
for
revenge
a
few
months
later
he
writes
to
batt
with
me
are
as
they
are
wont
to
be
in
such
cases
the
wound
received
in
england
begins
to
smart
only
now
that
it
has
become
inveterate
and
that
the
more
as
i
can
not
have
my
revenge
in
any
way
and
six
months
later
shall
swallow
it
an
occasion
may
offer
itself
no
doubt
to
be
even
with
them
yet
meanwhile
true
insight
told
this
man
whose
strength
did
not
always
attain
to
his
ideals
that
the
english
whom
he
had
just
seen
in
such
a
favourable
light
let
alone
his
special
friends
among
them
were
not
accessories
to
the
misfortune
he
never
reproached
more
and
mountjoy
whose
inaccurate
information
he
tells
us
had
done
the
harm
at
the
same
time
his
interest
which
he
always
saw
in
the
garb
of
virtue
told
him
that
now
especially
it
would
be
essential
not
to
break
off
his
relations
with
england
and
that
this
gave
him
a
splendid
chance
of
strengthening
them
afterwards
he
explained
this
with
a
naïveté
which
often
causes
his
writings
especially
where
he
tries
to
suppress
or
cloak
matters
to
read
like
confessions
to
paris
a
poor
man
i
understood
that
many
would
expect
i
should
take
revenge
with
my
pen
for
this
mishap
after
the
fashion
of
men
of
letters
by
writing
something
venomous
against
the
king
or
against
england
at
the
same
time
i
was
afraid
that
william
mountjoy
having
indirectly
caused
my
loss
of
money
would
be
apprehensive
of
losing
my
affection
in
order
therefore
both
to
put
the
expectations
of
those
people
to
shame
and
to
make
known
that
i
was
not
so
unfair
as
to
blame
the
country
for
a
private
wrong
or
so
inconsiderate
as
because
of
a
small
loss
to
risk
making
the
king
displeased
with
myself
or
with
my
friends
in
england
and
at
the
same
time
to
give
my
friend
mountjoy
a
proof
that
i
was
no
less
kindly
disposed
towards
him
than
before
i
resolved
to
publish
something
as
quickly
as
possible
as
i
had
nothing
ready
i
hastily
brought
together
by
a
few
days
reading
a
collection
of
adagia
in
the
supposition
that
such
a
booklet
however
it
might
turn
out
by
its
mere
usefulness
would
get
into
the
hands
of
students
in
this
way
i
demonstrated
that
my
friendship
had
not
cooled
off
at
all
next
in
a
poem
i
subjoined
i
protested
that
i
was
not
angry
with
the
king
or
with
the
country
at
being
deprived
of
my
money
and
my
scheme
was
not
ill
received
that
moderation
and
candour
procured
me
a
good
many
friends
in
england
at
the
time
erudite
upright
and
influential
men
this
is
a
characteristic
specimen
of
conduct
in
this
way
erasmus
succeeded
in
dealing
with
his
indignation
so
that
later
on
he
could
declare
when
the
recollection
came
up
occasionally
one
blow
i
had
lost
all
my
fortune
but
i
was
so
unconcerned
that
i
returned
to
my
books
all
the
more
cheerfully
and
ardently
but
his
friends
knew
how
deep
the
wound
had
been
on
hearing
that
henry
viii
had
ascended
the
throne
surely
all
bitterness
must
have
suddenly
left
your
soul
mountjoy
writes
to
him
in
possibly
through
the
pen
of
ammonius
the
years
after
his
return
to
france
were
difficult
ones
he
was
in
great
need
of
money
and
was
forced
to
do
what
he
could
as
a
man
of
letters
with
his
talents
and
knowledge
he
had
again
to
be
the
or
he
writes
polished
letters
full
of
mythology
and
modest
mendicity
as
a
poet
he
had
a
reputation
as
a
poet
he
could
expect
support
meanwhile
the
elevating
picture
of
his
theological
activities
remained
present
before
his
mind
eye
it
nerves
him
to
energy
and
perseverance
is
incredible
he
writes
to
batt
my
soul
yearns
to
finish
all
my
works
at
the
same
time
becoming
somewhat
proficient
in
greek
and
afterwards
to
devote
myself
entirely
to
the
sacred
learning
after
which
my
soul
has
been
hankering
for
a
long
time
i
am
in
fairly
good
health
so
i
shall
have
to
strain
every
nerve
this
year
to
get
the
work
we
gave
the
printer
published
and
by
dealing
with
theological
problems
to
expose
our
cavillers
who
are
very
numerous
as
they
deserve
if
three
more
years
of
life
are
granted
me
i
shall
be
beyond
the
reach
of
envy
here
we
see
him
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
accomplish
great
things
though
not
merely
under
the
impulse
of
true
devotion
already
he
sees
the
restoration
of
genuine
divinity
as
his
task
unfortunately
the
effusion
is
contained
in
a
letter
in
which
he
instructs
the
faithful
batt
as
to
how
he
should
handle
the
lady
of
veere
in
order
to
wheedle
money
out
of
her
for
years
to
come
the
efforts
to
make
a
living
were
to
cause
him
almost
constant
tribulations
and
petty
cares
he
had
had
more
than
enough
of
france
and
desired
nothing
better
than
to
leave
it
part
of
the
year
he
spent
at
orléans
adversity
made
him
narrow
there
is
the
story
of
his
relations
with
augustine
vincent
caminade
a
humanist
of
lesser
rank
he
ended
as
syndic
of
middelburg
who
took
young
men
as
lodgers
it
is
too
long
to
detail
here
but
remarkable
enough
as
revealing
erasmus
psychology
for
it
shows
how
deeply
he
mistrusted
his
friends
there
are
also
his
relations
with
jacobus
voecht
in
whose
house
he
evidently
lived
gratuitously
and
for
whom
he
managed
to
procure
a
rich
lodger
in
the
person
of
an
illegitimate
brother
of
the
bishop
of
cambray
at
this
time
erasmus
asserts
the
bishop
antimaecenas
he
now
calls
him
set
standonck
to
dog
him
in
paris
much
bitterness
there
is
in
the
letters
of
this
period
erasmus
is
suspicious
irritable
exacting
sometimes
rude
in
writing
to
his
friends
he
can
not
bear
william
hermans
any
longer
because
of
his
epicureanism
and
his
lack
of
energy
to
which
he
erasmus
certainly
was
a
stranger
but
what
grieves
us
most
is
the
way
he
speaks
to
honest
batt
he
is
highly
praised
certainly
erasmus
promises
to
make
him
immortal
too
but
how
offended
he
is
when
batt
can
not
at
once
comply
with
his
imperious
demands
how
almost
shameless
are
his
instructions
as
to
what
batt
is
to
tell
the
lady
of
veere
in
order
to
solicit
her
favour
for
erasmus
and
how
meagre
the
expressions
of
his
sorrow
when
the
faithful
batt
is
taken
from
him
by
death
in
the
first
half
of
it
is
as
if
erasmus
had
revenged
himself
on
batt
for
having
been
obliged
to
reveal
himself
to
his
true
friend
in
need
more
completely
than
he
cared
to
appear
to
anyone
or
for
having
disavowed
to
anna
of
borselen
his
fundamental
convictions
his
most
refined
taste
for
the
sake
of
a
meagre
gratuity
he
has
paid
homage
to
her
in
that
ponderous
burgundian
style
with
which
dynasties
in
the
netherlands
were
familiar
and
which
must
have
been
hateful
to
him
he
has
flattered
her
formal
piety
send
you
a
few
prayers
by
means
of
which
you
could
as
by
incantations
call
down
even
against
her
will
from
heaven
so
to
say
not
the
moon

her
who
gave
birth
to
the
sun

culture
latin
estrangement
from
holland
erasmus
as
a

meanwhile
renown
came
to
erasmus
as
the
fruit
of
those
literary
studies
which
as
he
said
had
ceased
to
be
dear
to
him
in
that
work
appeared
which
erasmus
had
written
after
his
misfortune
at
dover
and
had
dedicated
to
mountjoy
the
it
was
a
collection
of
about
eight
hundred
proverbial
sayings
drawn
from
the
latin
authors
of
antiquity
and
elucidated
for
the
use
of
those
who
aspired
to
write
an
elegant
latin
style
in
the
dedication
erasmus
pointed
out
the
profit
an
author
may
derive
both
in
ornamenting
his
style
and
in
strengthening
his
argumentation
from
having
at
his
disposal
a
good
supply
of
sentences
hallowed
by
their
antiquity
he
proposes
to
offer
such
a
help
to
his
readers
what
he
actually
gave
was
much
more
he
familiarized
a
much
wider
circle
than
the
earlier
humanists
had
reached
with
the
spirit
of
antiquity
until
this
time
the
humanists
had
to
some
extent
monopolized
the
treasures
of
classic
culture
in
order
to
parade
their
knowledge
of
which
the
multitude
remained
destitute
and
so
to
become
strange
prodigies
of
learning
and
elegance
with
his
irresistible
need
of
teaching
and
his
sincere
love
for
humanity
and
its
general
culture
erasmus
introduced
the
classic
spirit
in
so
far
as
it
could
be
reflected
in
the
soul
of
a
christian
among
the
people
not
he
alone
but
none
more
extensively
and
more
effectively
not
among
all
the
people
it
is
true
for
by
writing
in
latin
he
limited
his
direct
influence
to
the
educated
classes
which
in
those
days
were
the
upper
classes
erasmus
made
current
the
classic
spirit
humanism
ceased
to
be
the
exclusive
privilege
of
a
few
according
to
beatus
rhenanus
he
had
been
reproached
by
some
humanists
when
about
to
publish
the
for
divulging
the
mysteries
of
their
craft
but
he
desired
that
the
book
of
antiquity
should
be
open
to
all
the
literary
and
educational
works
of
erasmus
the
chief
of
which
were
begun
in
his
parisian
period
though
most
of
them
appeared
much
later
have
in
truth
brought
about
a
transmutation
of
the
general
modes
of
expression
and
of
argumentation
it
should
be
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
this
was
not
achieved
by
him
countless
others
at
that
time
were
similarly
engaged
but
we
have
only
to
cast
an
eye
on
the
broad
current
of
editions
of
the
of
the
to
realize
of
how
much
greater
consequence
he
was
in
this
respect
than
all
the
others
is
the
only
name
in
all
the
host
of
humanists
which
has
remained
a
household
word
all
over
the
globe
here
we
will
anticipate
the
course
of
erasmus
life
for
a
moment
to
enumerate
the
principal
works
of
this
sort
some
years
later
the
increased
from
hundreds
to
thousands
through
which
not
only
latin
but
also
greek
wisdom
spoke
in
he
published
in
the
same
manner
a
collection
of
similitudes
it
was
a
partial
realization
of
what
he
had
conceived
to
supplement
the
metaphors
saws
allusions
poetical
and
scriptural
allegories
all
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
similar
way
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
published
a
similar
thesaurus
of
the
witty
anecdotes
and
the
striking
words
or
deeds
of
wisdom
of
antiquity
the
in
addition
to
these
collections
we
find
manuals
of
a
more
grammatical
nature
also
piled
up
the
stock
of
expressions
copia
verborum
et
conscribendis
not
to
mention
works
of
less
importance
by
a
number
of
latin
translations
of
greek
authors
erasmus
had
rendered
a
point
of
prospect
accessible
to
those
who
did
not
wish
to
climb
the
whole
mountain
and
finally
as
inimitable
models
of
the
manner
in
which
to
apply
all
that
knowledge
there
were
the
and
that
almost
countless
multitude
of
letters
which
have
flowed
from
erasmus
pen
all
this
collectively
made
up
antiquity
in
such
quantity
and
quality
as
it
was
obtainable
in
the
sixteenth
century
exhibited
in
an
emporium
where
it
might
be
had
at
retail
each
student
could
get
what
was
to
his
taste
everything
was
to
be
had
there
in
a
great
variety
of
designs
may
read
my
in
such
a
manner
says
erasmus
of
the
later
augmented
edition
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
one
you
may
imagine
you
have
finished
the
whole
book
he
himself
made
indices
to
facilitate
its
use
in
the
world
of
scholasticism
he
alone
had
up
to
now
been
considered
an
authority
who
had
mastered
the
technicalities
of
its
system
of
thought
and
its
mode
of
expression
in
all
its
details
and
was
versed
in
biblical
knowledge
logic
and
philosophy
between
scholastic
parlance
and
the
spontaneously
written
popular
languages
there
yawned
a
wide
gulf
humanism
since
petrarch
had
substituted
for
the
rigidly
syllogistic
structure
of
an
argument
the
loose
style
of
the
antique
free
suggestive
phrase
in
this
way
the
language
of
the
learned
approached
the
natural
manner
of
expression
of
daily
life
and
raised
the
popular
languages
even
where
it
continued
to
use
latin
to
its
own
level
the
wealth
of
was
found
with
no
one
in
greater
abundance
than
with
erasmus
what
knowledge
of
life
what
ethics
all
supported
by
the
indisputable
authority
of
the
ancients
all
expressed
in
that
fine
airy
form
for
which
he
was
admired
and
such
knowledge
of
antiquities
in
addition
to
all
this
illimitable
was
the
craving
for
and
illimitable
the
power
to
absorb
what
is
extraordinary
in
real
life
this
was
one
of
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
these
minds
never
had
their
desired
share
of
striking
incidents
curious
details
rarities
and
anomalies
there
was
as
yet
no
symptom
of
that
mental
dyspepsia
of
later
periods
which
can
no
longer
digest
reality
and
relishes
it
no
more
men
revelled
in
plenty
and
yet
were
not
erasmus
and
his
as
leaders
of
civilization
on
a
wrong
track
was
it
true
reality
they
were
aiming
at
was
their
proud
latinity
not
a
fatal
error
there
is
one
of
the
crucial
points
of
history
a
reader
who
should
take
up
the
or
the
with
a
view
to
enriching
his
own
life
for
they
were
meant
for
this
purpose
and
it
is
what
gave
them
value
would
soon
ask
himself
matter
to
us
apart
from
strictly
philological
or
historical
considerations
those
endless
details
concerning
obscure
personages
of
antique
society
of
phrygians
of
thessalians
they
are
nothing
to
me
and
he
will
continue
they
really
mattered
nothing
to
erasmus
contemporaries
either
the
stupendous
history
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
not
enacted
in
classic
phrases
or
turns
it
was
not
based
on
classic
interests
or
views
of
life
there
were
no
phrygians
and
thessalians
no
agesilauses
or
dionysiuses
the
humanists
created
out
of
all
this
a
mental
realm
emancipated
from
the
limitations
of
time
and
did
their
own
times
pass
without
being
influenced
by
them
that
is
the
question
and
we
shall
not
attempt
to
answer
it
to
what
extent
did
humanism
influence
the
course
of
events
in
any
case
erasmus
and
his
coadjutors
greatly
heightened
the
international
character
of
civilization
which
had
existed
throughout
the
middle
ages
because
of
latin
and
of
the
church
if
they
thought
they
were
really
making
latin
a
vehicle
for
daily
international
use
they
overrated
their
power
it
was
no
doubt
an
amusing
fancy
and
a
witty
exercise
to
plan
in
such
an
international
as
the
parisian
student
world
such
models
of
sports
and
games
in
latin
as
the
offered
but
can
erasmus
have
seriously
thought
that
the
next
generation
would
play
at
marbles
in
latin
still
intellectual
intercourse
undoubtedly
became
very
easy
in
so
wide
a
circle
as
had
not
been
within
reach
in
europe
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
henceforth
it
was
no
longer
the
clergy
alone
and
an
occasional
literate
but
a
numerous
multitude
of
sons
of
burghers
and
nobles
qualifying
for
some
magisterial
office
who
passed
through
a
and
found
erasmus
in
their
path
erasmus
could
not
have
attained
to
his
celebrity
if
it
had
not
been
for
latin
to
make
his
native
tongue
a
universal
language
was
beyond
him
it
may
well
puzzle
a
of
erasmus
to
guess
what
a
talent
like
his
with
his
power
of
observation
his
delicacy
of
expression
his
gusto
and
wealth
might
have
meant
to
dutch
literature
just
imagine
the
written
in
the
racy
dutch
of
the
sixteenth
century
what
could
he
not
have
produced
if
instead
of
gleaning
and
commenting
upon
classic
adagia
he
had
for
his
themes
availed
himself
of
the
proverbs
of
the
vernacular
to
us
such
a
proverb
is
perhaps
even
more
sapid
than
the
sometimes
slightly
finical
turns
praised
by
erasmus
this
however
is
to
reason
unhistorically
this
was
not
what
the
times
required
and
what
erasmus
could
give
it
is
quite
clear
why
erasmus
could
only
write
in
latin
moreover
in
the
vernacular
everything
would
have
appeared
too
direct
too
personal
too
real
for
his
taste
he
could
not
do
without
that
thin
veil
of
vagueness
of
remoteness
in
which
everything
is
wrapped
when
expressed
in
latin
his
fastidious
mind
would
have
shrunk
from
the
pithy
coarseness
of
a
rabelais
or
the
rustic
violence
of
luther
german
estrangement
from
his
native
tongue
had
begun
for
erasmus
as
early
as
the
days
when
he
learned
reading
and
writing
estrangement
from
the
land
of
his
birth
set
in
when
he
left
the
monastery
of
steyn
it
was
furthered
not
a
little
by
the
ease
with
which
he
handled
latin
erasmus
who
could
express
himself
as
well
in
latin
as
in
his
mother
tongue
and
even
better
consequently
lacked
the
experience
of
after
all
feeling
thoroughly
at
home
and
of
being
able
to
express
himself
fully
only
among
his
compatriots
there
was
however
another
psychological
influence
which
acted
to
alienate
him
from
holland
after
he
had
seen
at
paris
the
perspectives
of
his
own
capacities
he
became
confirmed
in
the
conviction
that
holland
failed
to
appreciate
him
that
it
distrusted
and
slandered
him
perhaps
there
was
indeed
some
ground
for
this
conviction
but
partly
it
was
also
a
reaction
of
injured
in
holland
people
knew
too
much
about
him
they
had
seen
him
in
his
smallnesses
and
feebleness
there
he
had
been
obliged
to
obey
others
he
who
above
all
things
wanted
to
be
free
distaste
of
the
the
coarseness
and
intemperance
which
he
knew
to
prevail
there
were
summed
up
within
him
in
a
general
condemnatory
judgement
of
the
dutch
character
henceforth
he
spoke
as
a
rule
about
holland
with
a
sort
of
apologetic
contempt
see
that
you
are
content
with
dutch
fame
he
writes
to
his
old
friend
william
hermans
who
like
cornelius
aurelius
had
begun
to
devote
his
best
forces
to
the
history
of
his
native
country
holland
the
air
is
good
for
me
he
writes
elsewhere
the
extravagant
carousals
annoy
me
add
to
this
the
vulgar
uncultured
character
of
the
people
the
violent
contempt
of
study
no
fruit
of
learning
the
most
egregious
envy
and
excusing
the
imperfection
of
his
juvenilia
he
says
that
time
i
wrote
not
for
italians
but
for
hollanders
that
is
to
say
for
the
dullest
ears
and
in
another
place
is
demanded
from
a
dutchman
that
is
from
a
more
hopeless
person
than
a
b
oe
otian
and
again
the
story
is
not
very
witty
remember
it
is
a
dutch
story
no
doubt
false
modesty
had
its
share
in
such
sayings
after
he
visited
holland
only
on
hasty
journeys
there
is
no
evidence
that
after
he
ever
set
foot
on
dutch
soil
he
dissuaded
his
own
compatriots
abroad
from
returning
to
holland
still
now
and
again
a
cordial
feeling
of
sympathy
for
his
native
country
stirred
within
him
just
where
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
in
explaining
martial
in
the
for
venting
his
spleen
he
availed
himself
of
the
chance
of
writing
an
eloquent
panegyric
on
what
was
dearest
to
him
in
holland
country
that
i
am
always
bound
to
honour
and
revere
as
that
which
gave
me
birth
would
i
might
be
a
credit
to
it
just
as
on
the
other
hand
i
need
not
be
ashamed
of
it
their
reputed
boorishness
rather
redounds
to
their
honour
a
batavian
ear
means
a
horror
of
martial
obscene
jokes
i
could
wish
that
all
christians
might
have
dutch
ears
when
we
consider
their
morals
no
nation
is
more
inclined
to
humanity
and
benevolence
less
savage
or
cruel
their
mind
is
upright
and
void
of
cunning
and
all
humbug
if
they
are
somewhat
sensual
and
excessive
at
meals
it
results
partly
from
their
plentiful
supply
nowhere
is
import
so
easy
and
fertility
so
great
what
an
extent
of
lush
meadows
how
many
navigable
rivers
nowhere
are
so
many
towns
crowded
together
within
so
small
an
area
not
large
towns
indeed
but
excellently
governed
their
cleanliness
is
praised
by
everybody
nowhere
are
such
large
numbers
of
moderately
learned
persons
found
though
extraordinary
and
exquisite
erudition
is
rather
rare
they
were
erasmus
own
most
cherished
ideals
which
he
here
ascribes
to
his
compatriots
gentleness
sincerity
simplicity
purity
he
sounds
that
note
of
love
for
holland
on
other
occasions
when
speaking
of
lazy
women
he
adds
france
there
are
large
numbers
of
them
but
in
holland
we
find
countless
wives
who
by
their
industry
support
their
idling
and
revelling
husbands
and
in
the
colloquy
entitled
shipwreck
the
people
who
charitably
take
in
the
castaways
are
hollanders
is
no
more
humane
people
than
this
though
surrounded
by
violent
nations
in
addressing
english
readers
it
is
perhaps
not
superfluous
to
point
out
once
again
that
erasmus
when
speaking
of
holland
or
using
the
epithet
refers
to
the
county
of
holland
which
at
present
forms
the
provinces
of
north
and
south
holland
of
the
kingdom
of
the
netherlands
and
stretches
from
the
wadden
islands
to
the
estuaries
of
the
meuse
even
the
nearest
neighbours
such
as
zealanders
and
frisians
are
not
included
in
this
appellation
but
it
is
a
different
matter
when
erasmus
speaks
of
the
fatherland
or
of
a
compatriot
in
those
days
a
national
consciousness
was
just
budding
all
over
the
netherlands
a
man
still
felt
himself
a
hollander
a
frisian
a
fleming
a
brabantine
in
the
first
place
but
the
community
of
language
and
customs
and
still
more
the
strong
political
influence
which
for
nearly
a
century
had
been
exercised
by
the
burgundian
dynasty
which
had
united
most
of
these
low
countries
under
its
sway
had
cemented
a
feeling
of
solidarity
which
did
not
even
halt
at
the
linguistic
frontier
in
belgium
it
was
still
rather
a
strong
burgundian
patriotism
even
after
habsburg
had
occupied
the
place
of
burgundy
than
a
strictly
netherlandish
feeling
of
nationality
people
liked
by
using
a
heraldic
symbol
to
designate
the
netherlander
as
lions
erasmus
too
employs
the
term
in
his
works
we
gradually
see
the
narrower
hollandish
patriotism
gliding
into
the
burgundian
netherlandish
in
the
beginning
with
him
still
means
holland
proper
but
soon
it
meant
the
netherlands
it
is
curious
to
trace
how
by
degrees
his
feelings
regarding
holland
made
up
of
disgust
and
attachment
are
transferred
to
the
low
countries
in
general
my
youth
he
says
in
repeating
himself
did
not
write
for
italians
but
for
hollanders
the
people
of
brabant
and
flemings
so
they
now
all
share
the
reputation
of
bluntness
to
louvain
is
applied
what
formerly
was
said
of
holland
there
are
too
many
compotations
nothing
can
be
done
without
a
drinking
bout
nowhere
he
repeatedly
complains
is
there
so
little
sense
of
the
nowhere
is
study
so
despised
as
in
the
netherlands
and
nowhere
are
there
more
cavillers
and
slanderers
but
also
his
affection
has
expanded
when
longolius
of
brabant
plays
the

erasmus

nearly
three
days
to

only
that

that
he
is

i
pray
that
it
may
also
prove
a
blessing
to
the
fatherland
and
not
only
to
the
prince
when
his
strength
was
beginning
to
fail
he
began
to
think
more
and
more
of
returning

ferdinand

in

it
was

to

where
at
steyn
he
obtained
leave
to
spend
another
year
outside
the
monastery
for
the
sake
of
study
his
friends
would
be
ashamed
if
he
returned
after
so
many
years
of
study
without
having
acquired
some
authority
at
haarlem
he
visited
his
friend
william
hermans
then
turned
to
the
south
once
again
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
bishop
of
cambray
probably
at
brussels
thence
he
went
to
veere
but
found
no
opportunity
to
talk
to
his
patroness
in
july
he
subsided
into
quietness
at
the
castle
of
tournehem
with
his
faithful
friend
batt
in
all
his
comings
and
goings
he
does
not
for
a
moment
lose
sight
of
his
ideals
of
study
since
his
return
from
england
he
is
mastered
by
two
desires
to
edit
jerome
the
great
father
of
the
church
and
especially
to
learn
greek
thoroughly
understand
how
much
all
this
matters
to
my
fame
nay
to
my
preservation
he
writes
from
orléans
towards
the
end
of
to
batt
but
indeed
had
erasmus
been
an
ordinary
fame
and
success
hunter
he
might
have
had
recourse
to
plenty
of
other
expedients
it
was
the
ardent
desire
to
penetrate
to
the
source
and
to
make
others
understand
that
impelled
him
even
when
he
availed
himself
of
these
projects
of
study
to
raise
a
little
money
he
writes
to
batt
what
more
i
desire
from
you
you
must
wrest
a
gift
from
the
abbot
of
saint
bertin
you
know
the
man
disposition
invent
some
modest
and
plausible
reason
for
begging
tell
him
that
i
purpose
something
grand
to
restore
the
whole
of
jerome
however
comprehensive
he
may
be
and
spoiled
mutilated
entangled
by
the
ignorance
of
divines
and
to
the
greek
passages
i
venture
to
say
i
shall
be
able
to
lay
open
the
antiquities
and
the
style
of
jerome
understood
by
no
one
as
yet
tell
him
that
i
shall
want
not
a
few
books
for
the
purpose
and
moreover
the
help
of
greeks
and
that
therefore
i
require
support
in
saying
this
battus
you
will
be
telling
no
lies
for
i
really
mean
to
do
all
this
he
was
indeed
in
a
serious
mood
on
this
point
as
he
was
soon
to
prove
to
the
world
his
conquest
of
greek
was
a
veritable
feat
of
heroism
he
had
learned
the
simplest
rudiments
at
deventer
but
these
evidently
amounted
to
very
little
in
march
he
writes
to
batt
is
nearly
killing
me
but
i
have
no
time
and
i
have
no
money
to
buy
books
or
to
take
a
master
when
augustine
caminade
wants
his
homer
back
which
he
had
lent
to
him
erasmus
complains
deprive
me
of
my
sole
consolation
in
my
tedium
for
i
so
burn
with
love
for
this
author
though
i
can
not
understand
him
that
i
feast
my
eyes
and
my
mind
by
looking
at
him
was
erasmus
aware
that
in
saying
this
he
almost
literally
reproduced
feelings
which
petrarch
had
expressed
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
but
he
had
already
begun
to
study
whether
he
had
a
master
is
not
quite
clear
but
it
is
probable
he
finds
the
language
difficult
at
first
then
gradually
he
ventures
to
call
himself
candidate
in
this
language
and
he
begins
with
more
confidence
to
scatter
greek
quotations
through
his
letters
it
occupies
him
night
and
day
and
he
urges
all
his
friends
to
procure
greek
books
for
him
in
the
autumn
of
he
declares
that
he
can
properly
write
all
he
wants
in
greek
and
that
extempore
he
was
not
deceived
in
his
expectation
that
greek
would
open
his
eyes
to
the
right
understanding
of
holy
scripture
three
years
of
nearly
uninterrupted
study
amply
rewarded
him
for
his
trouble
hebrew
which
he
had
also
taken
up
he
abandoned
at
that
time
he
made
translations
from
the
greek
he
employed
it
critically
in
his
theological
studies
he
taught
it
amongst
others
to
william
cop
the
french
a
few
years
later
he
was
to
find
little
in
italy
to
improve
his
proficiency
in
greek
he
was
afterwards
inclined
to
believe
that
he
carried
more
of
the
two
ancient
languages
to
that
country
than
he
brought
back
nothing
testifies
more
to
the
enthusiasm
with
which
erasmus
applied
himself
to
greek
than
his
zeal
to
make
his
best
friends
share
in
its
blessings
batt
he
decided
should
learn
greek
but
batt
had
no
time
and
latin
appealed
more
to
him
when
erasmus
goes
to
haarlem
to
visit
william
hermans
it
is
to
make
him
a
greek
scholar
too
he
has
brought
a
handbag
full
of
books
but
he
had
only
his
trouble
for
his
pains
william
did
not
take
at
all
kindly
to
this
study
and
erasmus
was
so
disappointed
that
he
not
only
considered
his
money
and
trouble
thrown
away
but
also
thought
he
had
lost
a
friend
meanwhile
he
was
still
undecided
where
he
should
go
in
the
near
future
to
england
to
italy
or
back
to
paris
in
the
end
he
made
a
fairly
long
stay
as
a
guest
from
the
autumn
of
till
the
following
summer
first
at
saint
omer
with
the
prior
of
saint
bertin
and
afterwards
at
the
castle
of
courtebourne
not
far
off
at
saint
omer
erasmus
became
acquainted
with
a
man
whose
image
he
was
afterwards
to
place
beside
that
of
colet
as
that
of
a
true
divine
and
of
a
good
monk
at
the
same
time
jean
vitrier
the
warden
of
the
franciscan
monastery
at
saint
omer
erasmus
must
have
felt
attracted
to
a
man
who
was
burdened
with
a
condemnation
pronounced
by
the
sorbonne
on
account
of
his
too
frank
expressions
regarding
the
abuses
of
monastic
life
vitrier
had
not
given
up
the
life
on
that
account
but
he
devoted
himself
to
reforming
monasteries
and
convents
having
progressed
from
scholasticism
to
saint
paul
he
had
formed
a
very
liberal
conception
of
christian
life
strongly
opposed
to
practices
and
ceremonies
this
man
without
doubt
considerably
influenced
the
origin
of
one
of
most
celebrated
and
influential
works
the
militis
erasmus
himself
afterwards
confessed
that
the
was
born
by
chance
he
did
not
reflect
that
some
outward
circumstance
is
often
made
to
serve
an
inward
impulse
the
outward
circumstance
was
that
the
castle
of
tournehem
was
frequented
by
a
soldier
a
friend
of
batt
a
man
of
very
dissolute
conduct
who
behaved
very
badly
towards
his
pious
wife
and
who
was
moreover
an
uncultured
and
violent
hater
of
priests
for
the
rest
he
was
of
a
kindly
disposition
and
excepted
erasmus
from
his
hatred
of
divines
the
wife
used
her
influence
with
batt
to
get
erasmus
to
write
something
which
might
bring
her
husband
to
take
an
interest
in
religion
erasmus
complied
with
the
request
and
jean
vitrier
concurred
so
cordially
with
the
views
expressed
in
these
notes
that
erasmus
afterwards
elaborated
them
at
louvain
in
they
were
published
at
antwerp
by
dirck
maertensz
this
is
the
outward
genesis
of
the
but
the
inward
cause
was
that
sooner
or
later
erasmus
was
bound
to
formulate
his
attitude
towards
the
religious
conduct
of
the
life
of
his
day
and
towards
ceremonial
and
soulless
conceptions
of
christian
duty
which
were
an
eyesore
to
him
in
point
of
form
the
is
a
manual
for
an
illiterate
soldier
to
attain
to
an
attitude
of
mind
worthy
of
christ
as
with
a
finger
he
will
point
out
to
him
the
shortest
path
to
christ
he
assumes
the
friend
to
be
weary
of
life
at
court
a
common
theme
of
contemporary
literature
only
for
a
few
days
does
erasmus
interrupt
the
work
of
his
life
the
purification
of
theology
to
comply
with
his
friend
request
for
instruction
to
keep
up
a
soldierly
style
he
chooses
the
title
the
greek
word
that
even
in
antiquity
meant
both
a
poniard
and
a
manual
poniard
of
the
militant
christian
he
reminds
him
of
the
duty
of
watchfulness
and
enumerates
the
weapons
of
christ
militia
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
the
general
rules
of
the
christian
conduct
of
life
are
followed
by
a
number
of
remedies
for
particular
sins
and
faults
such
is
the
outward
frame
but
within
this
scope
erasmus
finds
an
opportunity
for
the
first
time
to
develop
his
theological
programme
this
programme
calls
upon
us
to
return
to
scripture
it
should
be
the
endeavour
of
every
christian
to
understand
scripture
in
its
purity
and
original
meaning
to
that
end
he
should
prepare
himself
by
the
study
of
the
ancients
orators
poets
philosophers
plato
especially
also
the
great
fathers
of
the
church
jerome
ambrose
augustine
will
be
found
useful
but
not
the
large
crowd
of
subsequent
exegetists
the
argument
chiefly
aims
at
subverting
the
conception
of
religion
as
a
continual
observance
of
ceremonies
this
is
judaic
ritualism
and
of
no
value
it
is
better
to
understand
a
single
verse
of
the
psalms
well
by
this
means
to
deepen
one
understanding
of
god
and
of
oneself
and
to
draw
a
moral
and
line
of
conduct
from
it
than
to
read
the
whole
psalter
without
attention
if
the
ceremonies
do
not
renew
the
soul
they
are
valueless
and
hurtful
are
wont
to
count
how
many
masses
they
have
heard
every
day
and
referring
to
them
as
to
something
very
important
as
though
they
owed
christ
nothing
else
they
return
to
their
former
habits
after
leaving
church
you
sacrifice
every
day
and
yet
you
live
for
yourself
you
worship
the
saints
you
like
to
touch
their
relics
do
you
want
to
earn
peter
and
paul
then
copy
the
faith
of
the
one
and
the
charity
of
the
other
and
you
will
have
done
more
than
if
you
had
walked
to
rome
ten
times
he
does
not
reject
formulae
and
practices
he
does
not
want
to
shake
the
faith
of
the
humble
but
he
can
not
suffer
that
christ
is
offered
a
cult
made
up
of
practices
only
and
why
is
it
the
monks
above
all
who
contribute
to
the
deterioration
of
faith
am
ashamed
to
tell
how
superstitiously
most
of
them
observe
certain
petty
ceremonies
invented
by
puny
human
minds
and
not
even
for
this
purpose
how
hatefully
they
want
to
force
others
to
conform
to
them
how
implicitly
they
trust
them
how
boldly
they
condemn
others
let
paul
teach
them
true
christianity
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
free
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
bondage
this
word
to
the
galatians
contains
the
doctrine
of
christian
liberty
which
soon
at
the
reformation
was
to
resound
so
loudly
erasmus
did
not
apply
it
here
in
a
sense
derogatory
to
the
dogmatics
of
the
catholic
church
but
still
it
is
a
fact
that
the
prepared
many
minds
to
give
up
much
that
he
still
wanted
to
keep
the
note
of
the
is
already
what
was
to
remain
the
note
of
erasmus
how
revolting
it
is
that
in
this
world
the
substance
and
the
shadow
differ
so
and
that
the
world
reverences
those
whom
it
should
not
reverence
that
a
hedge
of
infatuation
routine
and
thoughtlessness
prevents
mankind
from
seeing
things
in
their
true
proportions
he
expresses
it
later
in
the
of
and
in
the
it
is
not
merely
religious
feeling
it
is
equally
social
feeling
that
inspired
him
under
the
heading
opinions
worthy
of
a
christian
he
laments
the
extremes
of
pride
of
class
national
hostility
professional
envy
and
rivalry
between
religious
orders
which
keep
men
apart
let
everybody
sincerely
concern
himself
about
his
brother
dice
cost
you
a
thousand
gold
pieces
in
one
night
and
meanwhile
some
wretched
girl
compelled
by
poverty
sold
her
modesty
and
a
soul
is
lost
for
which
christ
gave
his
own
you
say
what
is
that
to
me
i
mind
my
own
business
according
to
my
lights
and
yet
you
holding
such
opinions
consider
yourself
a
christian
who
are
not
even
a
man
in
the
of
the
militant
christian
erasmus
had
for
the
first
time
said
the
things
which
he
had
most
at
heart
with
fervour
and
indignation
with
sincerity
and
courage
and
yet
one
would
hardly
say
that
this
booklet
was
born
of
an
irresistible
impulse
of
ardent
piety
erasmus
treats
it
as
we
have
seen
as
a
trifle
composed
at
the
request
of
a
friend
in
a
couple
of
days
stolen
from
his
studies
though
strictly
speaking
this
only
holds
good
of
the
first
draft
which
he
elaborated
afterwards
the
chief
object
of
his
studies
he
had
already
conceived
to
be
the
restoration
of
theology
one
day
he
will
expound
paul
the
slanderers
who
consider
it
the
height
of
piety
to
know
nothing
of
may
understand
that
we
in
our
youth
embraced
the
cultured
literature
of
the
ancients
and
that
we
acquired
a
correct
knowledge
of
the
two
languages
greek
and
latin
not
without
many
vigils
not
for
the
purpose
of
vainglory
or
childish
satisfaction
but
because
long
before
we
premeditated
adorning
the
temple
of
the
lord
which
some
have
too
much
desecrated
by
their
ignorance
and
barbarism
according
to
our
strength
with
help
from
foreign
parts
so
that
also
in
noble
minds
the
love
of
holy
scripture
may
be
kindled
is
it
not
still
the
humanist
who
speaks
we
hear
moreover
the
note
of
personal
justification
it
is
sounded
also
in
a
letter
to
colet
written
towards
the
close
of
accompanying
the
edition
of
the
in
which
the
was
first
published
did
not
write
the
to
parade
my
invention
or
eloquence
but
only
that
i
might
correct
the
error
of
those
whose
religion
is
usually
composed
of
more
than
judaic
ceremonies
and
observances
of
a
material
sort
and
who
neglect
the
things
that
conduce
to
piety
he
adds
and
this
is
typically
humanistic
have
tried
to
give
the
reader
a
sort
of
art
of
piety
as
others
have
written
the
theory
of
certain
sciences
the
art
of
piety
erasmus
might
have
been
surprised
had
he
known
that
another
treatise
written
more
than
sixty
years
before
by
another
canon
of
the
low
countries
would
continue
to
appeal
much
longer
and
much
more
urgently
to
the
world
than
his
manual
the
by
thomas
à
kempis
the
collected
with
some
other
pieces
into
a
volume
of
did
not
meet
with
such
a
great
and
speedy
success
as
had
been
bestowed
upon
the
that
erasmus
speculations
on
true
piety
were
considered
too
bold
was
certainly
not
the
cause
they
contained
nothing
antagonistic
to
the
teachings
of
the
church
so
that
even
at
the
time
of
the
when
the
church
had
become
highly
suspicious
of
everything
that
erasmus
had
written
the
divines
who
drew
up
the
of
his
work
found
only
a
few
passages
in
the
to
expunge
moreover
erasmus
had
inserted
in
the
volume
some
writings
of
unsuspected
catholic
tenor
for
a
long
time
it
was
in
great
repute
especially
with
theologians
and
monks
a
famous
preacher
at
antwerp
used
to
say
that
a
sermon
might
be
found
in
every
page
of
the
but
the
book
only
obtained
its
great
influence
in
wide
cultured
circles
when
upheld
by
erasmus
reputation
it
was
available
in
a
number
of
translations
english
czech
german
dutch
spanish
and
french
but
then
it
began
to
fall
under
suspicion
for
that
was
the
time
when
luther
had
unchained
the
great
struggle
they
have
begun
to
nibble
at
the
also
that
used
to
be
so
popular
with
divines
erasmus
writes
in
for
the
rest
it
was
only
two
passages
to
which
the
orthodox
critics
objected
footnotes
that
this
man
should
have
been
john
of
trazegnies
as
allen
thinks
possible
and
renaudet
accepts
is
still
all
too
uncertain
a
renaudet
préréforme
in
a
erasmus
speaks
of
the
of
the
father
augustine
cf
in
a
he
calls
the
of
cicero
a
a
dagger
so
the
appellation
had
been
in
his
mind
for
some
time

erasmus

he

of
in
the

his

had
died
it
is
a
pity
that
no
letters
written
by
erasmus
directly
after
his
bereavement
have
come
down
to
us
we
should
be
glad
to
have
for
that
faithful
helper
a
monument
in
addition
to
that
which
erasmus
erected
to
his
memory
in

remarried
and
as
a
patroness

about
the
same
time
a
prospective
new

he
still
felt
shut
out
from
paris
cologne
and
england
by
the
danger
of
the
plague
in
the
late
summer
of
he
went
to
louvain
thither
by
the
plague
he
says
the
university
of
louvain
established
in
to
wean
the
netherlands
in
spiritual
matters
from
paris
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
one
of
the
strongholds
of
theological
tradition
which
however
did
not
prevent
the
progress
of
classical
studies
how
else
should
adrian
of
utrecht
later
pope
but
at
that
time
dean
of
saint
peter
and
professor
of
theology
have
forthwith
undertaken
to
get
him
a
professorship
erasmus
declined
the
offer
however
certain
reasons
he
says
considering
his
great
distress
the
reasons
must
have
been
cogent
indeed
one
of
them
which
he
mentioned
is
not
very
clear
to
us
am
here
so
near
to
dutch
tongues
which
know
how
to
hurt
much
it
is
true
but
have
not
learned
to
profit
any
one
his
spirit
of
liberty
and
his
ardent
love
of
the
studies
to
which
he
wanted
to
devote
himself
entirely
were
no
doubt
his
chief
reasons
for
declining
but
he
had
to
make
a
living
life
at
louvain
was
expensive
and
he
had
no
regular
earnings
he
wrote
some
prefaces
and
dedicated
to
the
bishop
of
arras
chancellor
of
the
university
the
first
translation
from
the
greek
some
by
libanius
when
in
the
autumn
of
philip
le
beau
was
expected
back
in
the
netherlands
from
his
journey
to
spain
erasmus
wrote
with
sighs
of
distaste
a
panegyric
to
celebrate
the
safe
return
of
the
prince
it
cost
him
much
trouble
occupies
me
day
and
night
says
the
man
who
composed
with
such
incredible
facility
when
his
heart
was
in
the
work
is
harder
than
to
write
with
aversion
what
is
more
useless
than
to
write
something
by
which
we
unlearn
good
writing
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
really
flattered
as
sparingly
as
possible
the
practice
was
so
repulsive
to
him
that
in
his
preface
he
roundly
owned
that
to
tell
the
truth
this
whole
class
of
composition
was
not
to
his
taste
at
the
end
of
erasmus
was
back
at
paris
at
last
probably
he
had
always
meant
to
return
and
looked
upon
his
stay
at
louvain
as
a
temporary
exile
the
circumstances
under
which
he
left
louvain
are
unknown
to
us
because
of
the
almost
total
lack
of
letters
of
the
year
in
any
case
he
hoped
that
at
paris
he
would
sooner
be
able
to
attain
his
great
end
of
devoting
himself
entirely
to
the
study
of
theology
can
not
tell
you
dear
colet
he
writes
towards
the
end
of
i
hurry
on
with
all
sails
set
to
holy
literature
how
i
dislike
everything
that
keeps
me
back
or
retards
me
but
the
disfavour
of
fortune
who
always
looks
at
me
with
the
same
face
has
been
the
reason
why
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
clear
of
those
vexations
so
i
returned
to
france
with
the
purpose
if
i
can
not
solve
them
at
any
rate
of
ridding
myself
of
them
in
one
way
or
another
after
that
i
shall
devote
myself
with
all
my
heart
to
the
to
give
up
the
remainder
of
my
life
to
them
if
only
he
can
find
the
means
to
work
for
some
months
entirely
for
himself
and
disentangle
himself
from
profane
literature
can
colet
not
find
out
for
him
how
matters
stand
with
regard
to
the
proceeds
of
the
hundred
copies
of
the
which
at
one
time
he
sent
to
england
at
his
own
expense
the
liberty
of
a
few
months
may
be
bought
for
little
money
there
is
something
heroic
in
erasmus
scorning
to
make
money
out
of
his
facile
talents
and
enviable
knowledge
of
the
humanities
daring
indigence
so
as
to
be
able
to
realize
his
shining
ideal
of
restoring
theology
it
is
remarkable
that
the
same
italian
humanist
who
in
his
youth
had
been
his
guide
and
example
on
the
road
to
pure
latinity
and
classic
antiquity
lorenzo
valla
by
chance
became
his
leader
and
an
outpost
in
the
field
of
critical
theology
in
the
summer
of
hunting
in
the
old
library
of
the
premonstratensian
monastery
of
parc
near
louvain
no
preserves
is
hunting
a
greater
delight
he
found
a
manuscript
of
valla
on
the
new
testament
it
was
a
collection
of
critical
notes
on
the
text
of
the
gospels
the
epistles
and
revelation
that
the
text
of
the
vulgate
was
not
stainless
had
been
acknowledged
by
rome
itself
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
monastic
orders
and
individual
divines
had
set
themselves
to
correct
it
but
that
purification
had
not
amounted
to
much
in
spite
of
nicholas
of
work
in
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
probably
the
falling
in
with
valla
which
led
erasmus
who
was
formerly
more
inspired
with
the
resolution
to
edit
jerome
and
to
comment
upon
paul
he
was
to
do
both
at
a
later
date
to
turn
to
the
task
of
taking
up
the
new
testament
as
a
whole
in
order
to
restore
it
in
its
purity
in
march
already
josse
badius
at
paris
printed
valla
for
erasmus
as
a
sort
of
advertisement
of
what
he
himself
one
day
hoped
to
achieve
it
was
a
feat
of
courage
erasmus
did
not
conceal
from
himself
that
valla
the
humanist
had
an
ill
name
with
divines
and
that
there
would
be
an
outcry
about
intolerable
temerity
of
the
who
after
having
harassed
all
the
did
not
scruple
to
assail
holy
literature
with
his
petulant
pen
it
was
another
programme
much
more
explicit
and
defiant
than
the
had
been
once
more
it
is
not
clear
why
and
how
erasmus
left
paris
again
for
england
in
the
autumn
of
he
speaks
of
serious
reasons
and
the
advice
of
sensible
people
he
mentions
one
reason
lack
of
money
the
reprint
of
the
published
by
john
philippi
at
paris
in
had
probably
helped
him
through
for
the
time
being
the
edition
can
not
have
been
to
his
taste
for
he
had
been
dissatisfied
with
his
work
and
wanted
to
extend
it
by
weaving
his
new
greek
knowledge
into
it
from
holland
a
warning
voice
had
sounded
the
voice
of
his
superior
and
friend
servatius
demanding
an
account
of
his
departure
from
paris
evidently
his
dutch
friends
had
still
no
confidence
in
erasmus
his
work
and
his
future
in
many
respects
that
future
appeared
more
favourable
to
him
in
england
than
it
had
seemed
anywhere
thus
far
there
he
found
the
old
friends
men
of
consideration
and
importance
mountjoy
with
whom
on
his
arrival
he
stayed
some
months
colet
and
more
there
he
found
some
excellent
greek
scholars
whose
conversation
promised
to
be
profitable
and
amusing
not
colet
who
knew
little
greek
but
more
linacre
grocyn
latimer
and
tunstall
he
soon
came
in
contact
with
some
high
ecclesiastics
who
were
to
be
his
friends
and
patrons
richard
foxe
bishop
of
winchester
john
fisher
bishop
of
rochester
and
william
warham
archbishop
of
canterbury
soon
he
would
also
find
a
friend
whose
congenial
spirit
and
interests
to
some
extent
made
up
for
the
loss
of
batt
the
italian
andrew
ammonius
of
lucca
and
lastly
the
king
promised
him
an
ecclesiastical
benefice
it
was
not
long
before
erasmus
was
armed
with
a
dispensation
from
pope
julius
ii
dated
january
cancelling
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
accepting
an
english
benefice
translations
from
greek
into
latin
were
for
him
an
easy
and
speedy
means
to
obtain
favour
and
support
a
dialogue
by
lucian
followed
by
others
for
foxe
the
and
the
of
euripides
for
warham
he
now
also
thought
of
publishing
his
letters
clearly
his
relations
with
holland
were
not
yet
satisfactory
servatius
did
not
reply
to
his
letters
erasmus
ever
felt
hanging
over
him
a
menace
to
his
career
and
his
liberty
embodied
in
the
figure
of
that
friend
to
whom
he
was
linked
by
so
many
silken
ties
yonder
in
the
monastery
of
steyn
where
his
return
was
looked
forward
to
sooner
or
later
as
a
of
christendom
did
the
prior
know
of
the
papal
dispensation
exempting
erasmus
from
the
and
customs
of
the
monastery
of
steyn
in
holland
of
the
order
of
saint
augustine
probably
he
did
on
april
erasmus
writes
to
him
in
london
i
am
it
seems
greatly
esteemed
by
the
most
eminent
and
erudite
men
of
all
england
the
king
has
promised
me
a
curacy
the
visit
of
the
prince
necessitated
a
postponement
of
this
business
he
immediately
adds
am
deliberating
again
how
best
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
life
how
much
that
will
be
i
do
not
know
entirely
to
piety
to
christ
i
see
life
even
when
it
is
long
as
evanescent
and
dwindling
i
know
that
i
am
of
a
delicate
constitution
and
that
my
strength
has
been
encroached
upon
not
a
little
by
study
and
also
somewhat
by
misfortune
i
see
that
no
deliverance
can
be
hoped
from
study
and
that
it
seems
as
if
we
had
to
begin
over
again
day
after
day
therefore
i
have
resolved
content
with
my
mediocrity
especially
now
that
i
have
learned
as
much
greek
as
suffices
me
to
apply
myself
to
meditation
about
death
and
the
training
of
my
soul
i
should
have
done
so
before
and
have
husbanded
the
precious
years
when
they
were
at
their
best
but
though
it
is
a
tardy
husbandry
that
people
practise
when
only
little
remains
at
the
bottom
we
should
be
the
more
economical
accordingly
as
the
quantity
and
quality
of
what
is
left
diminishes
was
it
a
fit
of
melancholy
which
made
erasmus
write
those
words
of
repentance
and
renunciation
was
he
surprised
in
the
middle
of
the
pursuit
of
his
life
aim
by
the
consciousness
of
the
vanity
of
his
endeavours
the
consciousness
too
of
a
great
fatigue
is
this
the
deepest
foundation
of
erasmus
being
which
he
reveals
for
a
moment
to
his
old
and
intimate
friend
it
may
be
doubted
the
passage
tallies
very
ill
with
the
first
sentences
of
the
letter
which
are
altogether
concerned
with
success
and
prospects
in
a
letter
he
wrote
the
next
day
also
to
gouda
and
to
a
trusted
friend
there
is
no
trace
of
the
mood
he
is
again
thinking
of
his
future
we
do
not
notice
that
the
tremendous
zeal
with
which
he
continues
his
studies
is
relaxed
for
a
moment
and
there
are
other
indications
that
towards
servatius
who
knew
him
better
than
he
could
wish
and
who
moreover
as
prior
of
steyn
had
a
threatening
power
over
him
he
purposely
demeaned
himself
as
though
he
despised
the
world
meanwhile
nothing
came
of
the
english
prebend
but
suddenly
the
occasion
offered
to
which
erasmus
had
so
often
looked
forward
the
journey
to
italy
the
of
henry
vii
giovanni
battista
boerio
of
genoa
was
looking
for
a
master
to
accompany
his
sons
in
their
journey
to
the
universities
of
italy
erasmus
accepted
the
post
which
charged
him
neither
with
the
duties
of
tuition
nor
with
attending
to
the
young
fellows
but
only
with
supervising
and
guiding
their
studies
in
the
beginning
of
june
he
found
himself
on
french
soil
once
more
for
two
summer
months
the
party
of
travellers
stayed
at
paris
and
erasmus
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
have
several
of
his
works
which
he
had
brought
from
england
printed
at
paris
he
was
by
now
a
and
favourite
author
gladly
welcomed
by
the
old
friends
he
had
been
reputed
dead
and
made
much
of
josse
badius
printed
all
erasmus
offered
him
the
translations
of
euripides
and
lucian
a
collection
of
a
new
but
still
unaltered
edition
of
the
in
august
the
journey
was
continued
as
he
rode
on
horseback
along
the
alpine
roads
the
most
important
poem
erasmus
has
written
the
echo
of
an
abandoned
pursuit
originated
he
had
been
vexed
about
his
travelling
company
had
abstained
from
conversing
with
them
and
sought
consolation
in
composing
poetry
the
result
was
the
ode
which
he
called
equestre
vel
potius
about
the
inconveniences
of
old
age
dedicated
to
his
friend
william
cop
erasmus
was
one
of
those
who
early
feel
old
he
was
not
forty
and
yet
fancied
himself
across
the
threshold
of
old
age
how
quickly
it
had
come
he
looks
back
on
the
course
of
his
life
he
sees
himself
playing
with
nuts
as
a
child
as
a
boy
eager
for
study
as
a
youth
engrossed
in
poetry
and
scholasticism
also
in
painting
he
surveys
his
enormous
erudition
his
study
of
greek
his
aspiration
to
scholarly
fame
in
the
midst
of
all
this
old
age
has
suddenly
come
what
remains
to
him
and
again
we
hear
the
note
of
renunciation
of
the
world
and
of
devotion
to
christ
farewell
jests
and
trifles
farewell
philosophy
and
poetry
a
pure
heart
full
of
christ
is
all
he
desires
henceforward
here
in
the
stillness
of
the
alpine
landscape
there
arose
something
more
of
erasmus
deepest
aspirations
than
in
the
lament
to
servatius
but
in
this
case
too
it
is
a
stray
element
of
his
soul
not
the
strong
impulse
that
gave
direction
and
fullness
to
his
life
and
with
irresistible
pressure
urged
him
on
to
ever

erasmus
received
directly
upon

on
september
the
degree
of
doctor
of
theology
that
he
did
not
attach
much
value
to
the
degree
is
easy
to
understand
he
regarded
it
however
as
an
official
warrant
of
his
competence
as
a
writer
on
theological
subjects
which
would
strengthen
his
position
when
assailed
by
the
suspicion
of
his
critics
he
writes
disdainfully
about

title
even
to

in

days
had
helped
him
on
in

studies

obtaining

early
as

he

of
them

should
conform

times

that
quite
contrary

my
intention

i
was
overcome
by
the
prayers
of
friends
bologna
was
now
the
destination
of
his
journey
but
when
erasmus
arrived
there
a
war
was
in
progress
which
forced
him
to
retire
to
florence
for
a
time
pope
julius
ii
allied
with
the
french
at
the
head
of
an
army
marched
on
bologna
to
conquer
it
from
the
bentivogli
this
purpose
was
soon
attained
and
bologna
was
a
safe
place
to
return
to
on
november
erasmus
witnessed
the
triumphal
entry
of
the
martial
pope
of
these
days
nothing
but
short
hasty
letters
of
his
have
come
down
to
us
they
speak
of
unrest
and
rumours
of
war
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
impressed
by
the
beauty
of
the
italy
of
the
renaissance
the
scanty
correspondence
dating
from
his
stay
in
italy
mentions
neither
architecture
nor
sculpture
nor
pictures
when
much
later
he
happened
to
remember
his
visit
to
the
chartreuse
of
pavia
it
is
only
to
give
an
instance
of
useless
waste
and
magnificence
books
alone
seemed
to
occupy
and
attract
erasmus
in
italy
at
bologna
erasmus
served
as
a
mentor
to
the
young
boerios
to
the
end
of
the
year
for
which
he
had
bound
himself
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
to
him
he
could
not
stand
any
encroachment
upon
his
liberty
he
felt
caught
in
the
contract
as
in
a
net
the
boys
it
seems
were
intelligent
enough
if
not
so
brilliant
as
erasmus
had
seen
them
in
his
first
joy
but
with
their
private
tutor
clyfton
whom
he
at
first
extolled
to
the
sky
he
was
soon
at
loggerheads
at
bologna
he
experienced
many
vexations
for
which
his
new
relations
with
paul
bombasius
could
only
in
part
indemnify
him
he
worked
there
at
an
enlarged
edition
of
his
which
now
by
the
addition
of
the
greek
ones
increased
from
eight
hundred
to
some
thousands
of
items

requested
him
to
publish
anew
the

as
the

was
out

made
aldus

the
business

time

erasmus
was
one
of
those
true
who
pledge
their
heart
to
a
type
or
a
size
of
a
book
not
because
of
any
artistic
preference
but
because
of
readableness
and
handiness
which
to
them
are
of
the
very
greatest
importance
what
he
asked
of
aldus
was
a
small
book
at
a
low
price
towards
the
end
of
the
year
their
relations
had
gone
so
far
that
erasmus
gave
up
his
projected
journey
to
rome
for
the
time
to
remove
to
venice
there
personally
to
superintend
the
publication
of
his
works
now
there
was
no
longer
merely
the
question
of
a
little
book
of
translations
but
aldus
had
declared
himself
willing
to
print
the
enormously
increased
collection
of
the
beatus
rhenanus
tells
a
story
which
no
doubt
he
had
heard
from
erasmus
himself
how
erasmus
on
his
arrival
at
venice
had
gone
straight
to
the
and
was
kept
waiting
there
for
a
long
time
aldus
was
correcting
proofs
and
thought
his
visitor
was
one
of
those
inquisitive
people
by
whom
he
used
to
be
pestered
when
he
turned
out
to
be
erasmus
he
welcomed
him
cordially
and
procured
him
board
and
lodging
in
the
house
of
his
andrea
asolani
fully
eight
months
did
erasmus
live
there
in
the
environment
which
in
future
was
to
be
his
true
element
the
he
was
in
a
fever
of
hurried
work
about
which
he
would
often
sigh
but
which
after
all
was
congenial
to
him
the
augmented
collection
of

not

temerity

to
him
amid
the
noise
of
the

to
the
surprise
of
his
publisher
sat
and
wrote
usually
from
memory
so
busily
occupied
that
as
he
picturesquely
expressed
it
he
had
no
time
to
scratch
his
ears
he
was
lord
and
master
of
the
a
special
corrector
had
been
assigned
to
him
he
made
his
textual
changes
in
the
last
impression
aldus
also
read
the
proofs
asked
erasmus
i
am
studying
at
the
same
time
was
the
reply
meanwhile
erasmus
suffered
from
the
first
attack
of
his
tormenting
nephrolithic
malady
he
ascribed
it
to
the
food
he
got
at
asolani
and
later
took
revenge
by
painting
that
and
its
landlord
in
very
spiteful
colours
in
the
when
in
september
the
edition
of
the
was
ready
aldus
wanted
erasmus
to
remain
in
order
to
write
more
for
him
till
december
he
continued
to
work
at
venice
on
editions
of
plautus
terence
and
seneca
tragedies
visions
of
joint
labour
to
publish

that
classic
antiquity
still
held
in
the
way
of
hidden
treasures
together
with
hebrew
and
chaldean
stores
floated
before
his
mind
erasmus
belonged
to
the
generation
which
had
grown
up
together
with
the
youthful
art
of
printing
to
the
world
of
those
days
it
was
still
like
a
newly
acquired
organ
people
felt
rich
powerful
happy
in
the
possession
of
this
divine
implement
the
figure
of
erasmus
and
his
oe
were
only
rendered
possible
by
the
art
of
printing
he
was
its
glorious
triumph
and
equally
in
a
sense
its
victim
what
would
erasmus
have
been
without
the
to
broadcast
the
ancient
documents
to
purify
and
restore
them
was
his
life
passion
the
certainty
that
the
printed
book
places
exactly
the
same
text
in
the
hands
of
thousands
of
readers
was
to
him
a
consolation
that
former
generations
had
lacked
erasmus
is
one
of
the
first
who
after
his
name
as
an
author
was
established
worked
directly
and
continually
for
the
press
it
was
his
strength
but
also
his
weakness
it
enabled
him
to
exercise
an
immediate
influence
on
the
reading
public
of
europe
such
as
had
emanated
from
none
before
him
to
become
a
focus
of
culture
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
an
intellectual
central
station
a
touchstone
of
the
spirit
of
the
time
imagine
for
a
moment
what
it
would
have
meant
if
a
still
greater
mind
than
his
say
cardinal
nicholas
of
cusa
that
universal
spirit
who
had
helped
in
nursing
the
art
of
printing
in
its
earliest
infancy
could
have
availed
himself
of
the
art
as
it
was
placed
at
the
disposal
of
erasmus
the
dangerous
aspect
of
this
situation
was
that
printing
enabled
erasmus
having
once
become
a
centre
and
an
authority
to
address
the
world
at
large
immediately
about
all
that
occurred
to
him
much
of
his
later
mental
labour
is
after
all
really
but
repetition
ruminating
digression
unnecessary
vindication
from
assaults
to
which
his
greatness
alone
would
have
been
a
sufficient
answer
futilities
which
he
might
have
better
left
alone
much
of
this
work
written
directly
for
the
press
is
journalism
at
bottom
and
we
do
erasmus
an
injustice
by
applying
to
it
the
tests
of
lasting
excellence
the
consciousness
that
we
can
reach
the
whole
world
at
once
with
our
writings
is
a
stimulant
which
unwittingly
influences
our
mode
of
expression
a
luxury
that
only
the
highest
spirits
can
bear
with
impunity
the
link
between
erasmus
and
was
latin
without
his
incomparable
latinity
his
position
as
an
author
would
have
been
impossible
the
art
of
printing
undoubtedly
furthered
the
use
of
latin
it
was
the
latin
publications
which
in
those
days
promised
success
and
a
large
sale
for
a
publisher
and
established
his
reputation
for
they
were
broadcast
all
over
the
world
the
leading
publishers
were
themselves
scholars
filled
with
enthusiasm
for
humanism
cultured
and
people
acted
as
to
printers
such
as
peter
gilles
the
friend
of
erasmus
and
more
the
town
clerk
of
antwerp
who
corrected
for
dirck
maertensz
the
great
were
in
a
local
sense
too
the
foci
of
intellectual
intercourse
the
fact
that
england
had
lagged
behind
thus
far
in
the
evolution
of
the
art
of
printing
contributed
not
a
little
no
doubt
to
prevent
erasmus
from
settling
there
where
so
many
ties
held
and
so
many
advantages
allured
him
to
find
a
permanent
place
of
residence
was
indeed
and
apart
from
this
fact
very
hard
for
him
towards
the
end
of
he
accepted
the
post
of
tutor
in
rhetorics
to
the
young
alexander
stewart
a
natural
son
of
james
iv
of
scotland
and
already
in
spite
of
his
youth
archbishop
of
saint
andrews
now
a
student
at
padua
the
danger
of
war
soon
drove
them
from
upper
italy
to
siena
here
erasmus
obtained
leave
to
visit
rome
he
arrived
there
early
in
no
longer
an
unknown
canon
from
the
northern
regions
but
a
celebrated
and
honoured
author
all
the
charms
of
the
eternal
city
lay
open
to
him
and
he
must
have
felt
keenly
gratified
by
the
consideration
and
courtesy
with
which
cardinals
and
prelates
such
as
giovanni
de
medici
afterwards
leo
x
domenico
grimani
riario
and
others
treated
him
it
seems
that
he
was
even
offered
some
post
in
the
curia
but
he
had
to
return
to
his
youthful
archbishop
with
whom
he
thereupon
visited
rome
again
incognito
and
afterwards
travelled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
naples
he
inspected
the
cave
of
the
sibylla
of
cumae
but
what
it
meant
to
him
we
do
not
know
this
entire
period
following
his
departure
from
padua
and
all
that
follows
till
the
spring
of
in
certain
respects
the
most
important
part
of
his
life
remains
unrecorded
in
a
single
letter
that
has
come
down
to
us
here
and
there
he
has
occasionally
and
at
a
much
later
date
touched
upon
some
impressions
of
rome
but
the
whole
remains
vague
and
dim
it
is
the
incubation
period
of
the
of
that
is
thus
obscured
from
view
on
april
king
henry
vii
of
england
died
his
successor
was
the
young
prince
whom
erasmus
had
saluted
at
eltham
in
to
whom
he
had
dedicated
his
poem
in
praise
of
great
britain
and
who
during
his
stay
at
bologna
had
distinguished
him
by
a
latin
letter
as
creditable
to
erasmus
as
to
the
royal
latinist
if
ever
the
chance
of
obtaining
a
patron
seemed
favourable
it
was
now
when
this
promising
lover
of
letters
ascended
the
throne
as
henry
viii
lord
mountjoy
erasmus
most
faithful
maecenas
thought
so
too
and
pointed
out
the
fact
to
him
in
a
letter
of
may
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
he
wrote
how
vigorous
how
upright
and
just
how
zealous
in
the
cause
of
literature
and
men
of
letters
was
the
conduct
of
the
youthful
prince
mountjoy
or
ammonius
who
probably
drew
up
the
flowery
document
for
him
was
exultant
a
laughing
sky
and
tears
of
joy
are
the
themes
of
the
letter
evidently
however
erasmus
himself
had
on
his
side
already
sounded
mountjoy
as
to
his
chances
as
soon
as
the
tidings
of
henry
vii
death
became
known
at
rome
not
without
lamentations
about
cares
and
weakened
health
archbishop
of
canterbury
mountjoy
was
able
to
apprise
erasmus
not
only
continually
engrossed
in
your
and
praises
you
to
the
skies
but
he
also
promises
you
a
benefice
on
your
return
and
sends
you
five
pounds
for
travelling
expenses
which
sum
was
doubled
by
mountjoy
we
do
not
know
whether
erasmus
really
hesitated
before
he
reached
his
decision
cardinal
grimani
he
asserts
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
in
vain
for
in
july
he
left
rome
and
italy
never
to
return
as
he
crossed
the
alps
for
the
second
time
not
on
the
french
side
now
but
across
the
splügen
through
switzerland
his
genius
touched
him
again
as
had
happened
in
those
high
regions
three
years
before
on
the
road
to
italy
but
this
time
it
was
not
in
the
guise
of
the
latin
muse
who
then
drew
from
him
such
artful
and
pathetic
poetical
meditations
about
his
past
life
and
pious
vows
for
the
future
it
was
something
much
more
subtle
and
grand
the
of

to
grimani

from

can

confusion
of

his
slightingly
its
value
while
he
rode
over
the
mountain

erasmus
restless
spirit
now
unfettered
for
some
days
by
set
tasks
occupied
itself
with
everything
he
had
studied
and
read
in
the
last
few
years
and
with
everything
he
had
seen
what
ambition
what
what
pride
and
conceit
filled
the
world
he
thought
of
thomas
more
whom
he
was
now
to
see
again
that
most
witty
and
wise
of
all
his
friends
with
that
curious
name
the
greek
word
for
a
fool
which
so
ill
became
his
personality
anticipating
the
gay
jests
which
more
conversation
promised
there
grew
in
his
mind
that
masterpiece
of
humour
and
wise
irony
the
of
the
world
as
the
scene
of
universal
folly
folly
as
the
indispensable
element
making
life
and
society
possible
and
all
this
put
into
the
mouth
of
stultitia
folly
itself
true
antitype
of
minerva
who
in
a
panegyric
on
her
own
power
and
usefulness
praises
herself
as
to
form
it
is
a
such
as
he
had
translated
from
the
greek
of
libanius
as
to
the
spirit
a
revival
of
lucian
whose
translated
by
him
three
years
before
may
have
suggested
the
theme
it
must
have
been
in
the
incomparably
lucid
moments
of
that
brilliant
intellect
all
the
particulars
of
classic
reading
which
the
year
before
he
worked
up
in
the
new
edition
of
the
were
still
at
his
immediate
disposal
in
that
retentive
and
capacious
memory
reflecting
at
his
ease
on
all
that
wisdom
of
the
ancients
he
secreted
the
juices
required
for
his
expostulation
he
arrived
in
london
took
up
his
abode
in
more
house
in
bucklersbury
and
there
tortured
by
nephritic
pains
he
wrote
down
in
a
few
days
without
having
his
books
with
him
the
perfect
work
of
art
that
must
have
been
ready
in
his
mind
stultitia
was
truly
born
in
the
manner
of
her
serious
sister
pallas
as
to
form
and
imagery
the
is
faultless
the
product
of
the
inspired
moments
of
creative
impulse
the
figure
of
an
orator
confronting
her
public
is
sustained
to
the
last
in
a
masterly
way
we
see
the
faces
of
the
auditors
light
up
with
glee
when
folly
appears
in
the
pulpit
we
hear
the
applause
interrupting
her
words
there
is
a
wealth
of
fancy
coupled
with
so
much
soberness
of
line
and
colour
such
reserve
that
the
whole
presents
a
perfect
instance
of
that
harmony
which
is
the
essence
of
renaissance
expression
there
is
no
exuberance
in
spite
of
the
multiplicity
of
matter
and
thought
but
a
temperateness
a
smoothness
an
airiness
and
clearness
which
are
as
gladdening
as
they
are
relaxing
in
order
perfectly
to
realize
the
artistic
perfection
of
erasmus
book
we
should
compare
it
with
rabelais

says
folly
world
can
not
exist
for
a
moment
for
is
not
all
that
is
done
at
all
among
mortals
full
of
folly
is
it
not
performed
by
fools
and
for
fools
society
no
cohabitation
can
be
pleasant
or
lasting
without
folly
so
much
so
that
a
people
could
not

its

nor
the

his

nor
the

her
mistress

flatter

now
smearing
themselves
with
some
honey
of
folly
in
that
sentence
the
summary
of
the
is
contained
folly
here
is
worldly
wisdom
resignation
and
lenient
judgement
he
who
pulls
off
the
masks
in
the
comedy
of
life
is
ejected
what
is
the
whole
life
of
mortals
but
a
sort
of
play
in
which
each
actor
appears
on
the
boards
in
his
specific
mask
and
acts
his
part
till
the
calls
him
off
he
acts
wrongly
who
does
not
adapt
himself
to
existing
conditions
and
demands
that
the
game
shall
be
a
game
no
longer
it
is
the
part
of
the
truly
sensible
to
mix
with
all
people
either
conniving
readily
at
their
folly
or
affably
erring
like
themselves
and
the
necessary
driving
power
of
all
human
action
is
folly

he
who
does
not
please
himself
effects
little
take
away
that
condiment
of
life
and
the
word
of
the
orator
cools
the
poet
is
laughed
at
the
artist
perishes
with
his
art
folly
in
the
garb
of
pride
of
vanity
of
vainglory
is
the
hidden
spring
of
all
that
is
considered
high
and
great
in
this
world
the
state
with
its
posts
of
honour
patriotism
and
national
pride
the
stateliness
of
ceremonies
the
delusion
of
caste
and
nobility
what
is
it
but
folly
war
the
most
foolish
thing
of
all
is
the
origin
of
all
heroism
what
prompted
the
deciuses
what
curtius
to
sacrifice
themselves
vainglory
it
is
this
folly
which
produces
states
through
her
empires
religion
exist
this
is
bolder
and
more
chilling
than
machiavelli
more
detached
than
montaigne
but
erasmus
will
not
have
it
credited
to
him
it
is
folly
who
speaks
he
purposely
makes
us
tread
the
round
of
the
as
in
the
old
saw
a
cretan
said
all
cretans
are
liars
wisdom
is
to
folly
as
reason
is
to
passion
and
there
is
much
more
passion
than
reason
in
the
world
that
which
keeps
the
world
going
the
fount
of
life
is
folly
for
what
else
is
love
why
do
people
marry
if
not
out
of
folly
which
sees
no
objections
all
enjoyment
and
amusement
is
only
a
condiment
of
folly
when
a
wise
man
wishes
to
become
a
father
he
has
first
to
play
the
fool
for
what
is
more
foolish
than
the
game
of
procreation
unperceived
the
orator
has
incorporated
here
with
folly
all
that
is
vitality
and
the
courage
of
life
folly
is
spontaneous
energy
that
no
one
can
do
without
he
who
is
perfectly
sensible
and
serious
can
not
live
the
more
people
get
away
from
me
stultitia
the
less
they
live
why
do
we
kiss
and
cuddle
little
children
if
not
because
they
are
still
so
delightfully
foolish
and
what
else
makes
youth
so
elegant
now
look
at
the
truly
serious
and
sensible
they
are
awkward
at
everything
at
at
a
dance
in
playing
in
social
intercourse
if
they
have
to
buy
or
to
contract
things
are
sure
to
go
wrong
quintilian
says
that
stage
fright
bespeaks
the
intelligent
orator
who
knows
his
faults
right
but
does
not
then
quintilian
confess
openly
that
wisdom
is
an
impediment
to
good
execution
and
has
not
stultitia
the
right
to
claim
prudence
for
herself
if
the
wise
out
of
shame
out
of
bashfulness
undertake
nothing
in
circumstances
where
fools
pluckily
set
to
work
here
erasmus
goes
to
the
root
of
the
matter
in
a
psychological
sense
indeed
the
consciousness
of
falling
short
in
achievement
is
the
brake
clogging
action
is
the
great
inertia
retarding
the
progress
of
the
world
did
he
know
himself
for
one
who
is
awkward
when
not
bending
over
his
books
but
confronting
men
and
affairs
folly
is
gaiety
and
lightheartedness
indispensable
to
happiness
the
man
of
mere
reason
without
passion
is
a
stone
image
blunt
and
without
any
human
feeling
a
spectre
or
monster
from
whom
all
fly
deaf
to
all
natural
emotions
susceptible
neither
to
love
nor
compassion
nothing
escapes
him
in
nothing
he
errs
he
sees
through
everything
he
weighs
everything
accurately
he
forgives
nothing
he
is
only
satisfied
with
himself
he
alone
is
healthy
he
alone
is
king
he
alone
is
free
it
is
the
hideous
figure
of
the
doctrinaire
which
erasmus
is
thinking
of
which
state
he
exclaims
would
desire
such
an
absolutely
wise
man
for
a
magistrate
he
who
devotes
himself
to
tasting
all
the
bitterness
of
life
with
wise
insight
would
forthwith
deprive
himself
of
life
only
folly
is
a
remedy
to
err
to
be
mistaken
to
be
ignorant
is
to
be
human
how
much
better
it
is
in
marriage
to
be
blind
to
a
wife
shortcomings
than
to
make
away
with
oneself
out
of
jealousy
and
to
fill
the
world
with
tragedy
adulation
is
virtue
there
is
no
cordial
devotion
without
a
little
adulation
it
is
the
soul
of
eloquence
of
medicine
and
poetry
it
is
the
honey
and
the
sweetness
of
all
human
customs
again
a
series
of
valuable
social
qualities
is
slyly
incorporated
with
folly
benevolence
kindness
inclination
to
approve
and
to
admire
but
especially
to
approve
of
oneself
there
is
no
pleasing
others
without
beginning
by
flattering
ourselves
a
little
and
approving
of
ourselves
what
would
the
world
be
if
everyone
was
not
proud
of
his
standing
his
calling
so
that
no
person
would
change
places
with
another
in
point
of
good
appearance
of
fancy
of
good
family
of
landed
property
humbug
is
the
right
thing
why
should
any
one
desire
true
erudition
the
more
incompetent
a
man
the
pleasanter
his
life
is
and
the
more
he
is
admired
look
at
professors
poets
orators
man
mind
is
so
made
that
he
is
more
impressed
by
lies
than
by
the
truth
go
to
church
if
the
priest
deals
with
serious
subjects
the
whole
congregation
is
dozing
yawning
feeling
bored
but
when
he
begins
to
tell
some
story
they
awake
sit
up
and
hang
on
his
lips
to
be
deceived
philosophers
say
is
a
misfortune
but
not
to
be
deceived
is
a
superlative
misfortune
if
it
is
human
to
err
why
should
a
man
be
called
unhappy
because
he
errs
since
he
was
so
born
and
made
and
it
is
the
fate
of
all
do
we
pity
a
man
because
he
can
not
fly
or
does
not
walk
on
four
legs
we
might
as
well
call
the
horse
unhappy
because
it
does
not
learn
grammar
or
eat
cakes
no
creature
is
unhappy
if
it
lives
according
to
its
nature
the
sciences
were
invented
to
our
utmost
destruction
far
from
conducing
to
our
happiness
they
are
even
in
its
way
though
for
its
sake
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
invented
by
the
agency
of
evil
demons
they
have
stolen
into
human
life
with
the
other
pests
for
did
not
the
people
of
the
golden
age
live
happily
unprovided
with
any
science
only
led
by
nature
and
instinct
what
did
they
want
grammar
for
when
all
spoke
the
same
language
why
have
dialectics
when
there
were
no
quarrels
and
no
differences
of
opinion
why
jurisprudence
when
there
were
no
bad
morals
from
which
good
laws
sprang
they
were
too
religious
to
investigate
with
impious
curiosity
the
secrets
of
nature
the
size
motions
influence
of
the
stars
the
hidden
cause
of
things
it
is
the
old
idea
which
germinated
in
antiquity
here
lightly
touched
upon
by
erasmus
afterwards
proclaimed
by
rousseau
in
bitter
earnest
civilization
is
a
plague
wisdom
is
misfortune
but
is
happiness
grammarians
who
wield
the
sceptre
of
wisdom
schoolmasters
that
is
would
be
the
most
wretched
of
all
people
if
i
folly
did
not
mitigate
the
discomforts
of
their
miserable
calling
by
a
sort
of
sweet
frenzy
but
what
holds
good
of
schoolmasters
also
holds
good
of
poets
orators
authors
for
them
too
all
happiness
merely
consists
in
vanity
and
delusion
the
lawyers
are
no
better
off
and
after
them
come
the
philosophers
next
there
is
a
numerous
procession
of
clergy
divines
monks
bishops
cardinals
popes
only
interrupted
by
princes
and
courtiers
in
the
chapters
which
review
these
offices
and
callings
satire
has
shifted
its
ground
a
little
throughout
the
work
two
themes
are
intertwined
that
of
salutary
folly
which
is
true
wisdom
and
that
of
deluded
wisdom
which
is
pure
folly
as
they
are
both
put
into
the
mouth
of
folly
we
should
have
to
invert
them
both
to
get
truth
if
folly
were
not
wisdom
now
it
is
clear
that
the
first
is
the
principal
theme
erasmus
starts
from
it
and
he
returns
to
it
only
in
the
middle
as
he
reviews
human
accomplishments
and
dignities
in
their
universal
foolishness
the
second
theme
predominates
and
the
book
becomes
an
ordinary
satire
on
human
folly
of
which
there
are
many
though
few
are
so
delicate
but
in
the
other
parts
it
is
something
far
deeper
occasionally
the
satire
runs
somewhat
off
the
line
when
stultitia
directly
censures
what
erasmus
wishes
to
censure
for
instance
indulgences
silly
belief
in
wonders
selfish
worship
of
the
saints
or
gamblers
whom
she
folly
ought
to
praise
or
the
spirit
of
systematizing
and
levelling
and
the
jealousy
of
the
monks
for
contemporary
readers
the
importance
of
the
was
to
a
great
extent
in
the
direct
satire
its
lasting
value
is
in
those
passages
where
we
truly
grant
that
folly
is
wisdom
and
the
reverse
erasmus
knows
the
aloofness
of
the
ground
of
all
things
all
consistent
thinking
out
of
the
dogmas
of
faith
leads
to
absurdity
only
look
at
the
theological
quiddities
of
effete
scholasticism
the
apostles
would
not
have
understood
them
in
the
eyes
of
divines
they
would
have
been
fools
holy
scripture
itself
sides
with
folly
foolishness
of
god
is
wiser
than
men
says
saint
paul
god
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
pleased
god
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
believe
christ
loved
the
and
the
ignorant
children
women
poor
fishermen
nay
even
such
animals
as
are
farthest
removed
from
vulpine
cunning
the
ass
which
he
wished
to
ride
the
dove
the
lamb
the
sheep
here
there
is
a
great
deal
behind
the
seemingly
light
jest
religion
seems
in
general
to
have
some
affinity
with
a
certain
sort
of
folly
was
it
not
thought
the
apostles
were
full
of
new
wine
and
did
not
the
judge
say
thou
art
beside
thyself
when
are
we
beside
ourselves
when
the
spirit
breaks
its
fetters
and
tries
to
escape
from
its
prison
and
aspires
to
liberty
that
is
madness
but
it
is
also
and
the
highest
wisdom
true
happiness
is
in
selflessness
in
the
furore
of
lovers
whom
plato
calls
happiest
of
all
the
more
absolute
love
is
the
greater
and
more
rapturous
is
the
frenzy
heavenly
bliss
itself
is
the
greatest
insanity
truly
pious
people
enjoy
its
shadow
on
earth
already
in
their
meditations
here
stultitia
breaks
off
her
discourse
apologizing
in
a
few
words
in
case
she
may
have
been
too
petulant
or
talkative
and
leaves
the
pulpit

illustrious
initiates
it
was
an
unrivalled
feat
of
art
even
in
these
last
chapters
neither
to
lose
the
light
comical
touch
nor
to
lapse
into
undisguised
profanation
it
was
only
feasible
by
veritable
dancing
on
the
of
sophistry
in
the
erasmus
is
all
the
time
hovering
on
the
brink
of
profound
truths
but
what
a
boon
it
was
still
granted
to
those
times
to
be
able
to
treat
of
all
this
in
a
vein
of
pleasantry
for
this
should
be
impressed
upon
our
minds
that
the
is
a
true
gay
jest
the
laugh
is
more
delicate
but
no
less
hearty
than
rabelais
plaudite
vivite
bibite
common
people
abound
to
such
a
degree
and
everywhere
in
so
many
forms
of
folly
that
a
thousand
democrituses
would
be
insufficient
to
laugh
at
them
all
and
they
would
require
another
democritus
to
laugh
at
them
how
could
one
take
the
too
seriously
when
even
more
which
is
a
true
to
it
and
makes
such
a
grave
impression
on
us
is
treated
by
its
author
and
erasmus
as
a
mere
jest
there
is
a
place
where
the
seems
to
touch
both
more
and
rabelais
the
place
where
stultitia
speaks
of
her
father
plutus
the
god
of
wealth
at
whose
beck
all
things
are
turned
according
to
whose
will
all
human
affairs
are
regulated
war
and
peace
government
and
counsel
justice
and
treaties
he
has
begotten
her
on
the
nymph
youth
not
a
senile
purblind
plutus
but
a
fresh
god
warm
with
youth
and
nectar
like
another
gargantua
the
figure
of
folly
of
gigantic
size
looms
large
in
the
period
of
the
renaissance
she
wears
a
fool
cap
and
bells
people
laughed
loudly
and
with
unconcern
at
all
that
was
foolish
without
discriminating
between
species
of
folly
it
is
remarkable
that
even
in
the
delicate
as
it
is
the
author
does
not
distinguish
between
the
unwise
or
the
silly
between
fools
and
lunatics
holbein
illustrating
erasmus
knows
but
of
one
representation
of
a
fool
with
a
staff
and
ass
ears
erasmus
speaks
without
clear
transition
now
of
foolish
persons
and
now
of
real
lunatics
they
are
happiest
of
all
he
makes
stultitia
say
they
are
not
frightened
by
spectres
and
apparitions
they
are
not
tortured
by
the
fear
of
impending
calamities
everywhere
they
bring
mirth
jests
frolic
and
laughter
evidently
he
here
means
harmless
imbeciles
who
indeed
were
often
used
as
jesters
this
identification
of
denseness
and
insanity
is
kept
up
however
like
the
confusion
of
the
comic
and
the
simply
ridiculous
and
all
this
is
well
calculated
to
make
us
feel
how
wide
the
gap
has
already
become
that
separates
us
from
erasmus
in
later
years
he
always
spoke
slightingly
of
his
he
considered
it
so
unimportant
he
says
as
to
be
unworthy
of
publication
yet
no
work
of
his
had
been
received
with
such
applause
it
was
a
trifle
and
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
his
character
more
had
made
him
write
it
as
if
a
camel
were
made
to
dance
but
these
disparaging
utterances
were
not
without
a
secondary
purpose
the
had
not
brought
him
only
success
and
pleasure
the
exceedingly
susceptible
age
in
which
he
lived
had
taken
the
satire
in
very
bad
part
where
it
seemed
to
glance
at
offices
and
orders
although
in
his
preface
he
had
tried
to
safeguard
himself
from
the
reproach
of
irreverence
his
airy
play
with
the
texts
of
holy
scripture
had
been
too
venturesome
for
many
his
friend
martin
van
dorp
upbraided
him
with
having
made
a
mock
of
eternal
life
erasmus
did
what
he
could
to
convince
that
the
purpose
of
the
was
no
other
than
to
exhort
people
to
be
virtuous
in
affirming
this
he
did
his
work
injustice
it
was
much
more
than
that
but
in
he
was
no
longer
what
he
had
been
in
repeatedly
he
had
been
obliged
to
defend
his
most
witty
work
had
he
known
that
it
would
offend
he
might
have
kept
it
back
he
writes
in
to
an
acquaintance
at
louvain
even
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
warded
off
the
insinuations
of
alberto
pio
of
carpi
in
a
lengthy
expostulation
erasmus
made
no
further
ventures
in
the
genre
of
the
of
one
might
consider
the
treatise
which
he
published
in
as
an
attempt
to
make
a
to
the
the
book
is
called
the
use
and
abuse
of
the
in
the
opening
pages
there
is
something
that
reminds
us
of
the
style
of
the
but
it
lacks
all
the
charm
both
of
form
and
of
thought
should
one
pity
erasmus
because
of
all
his
publications
collected
in
ten
folio
volumes
only
the
of
has
remained
a
really
popular
book
it
is
apart
from
the
perhaps
the
only
one
of
his
works
that
is
still
read
for
its
own
sake
the
rest
is
now
only
studied
from
a
historical
point
of
view
for
the
sake
of
becoming
acquainted
with
his
person
or
his
times
it
seems
to
me
that
perfect
justice
has
been
done
in
this
case
the
of
is
his
best
work
he
wrote
other
books
more
erudite
some
more
pious
some
perhaps
of
equal
or
greater
influence
on
his
time
but
each
has
had
its
day
alone
was
to
be
immortal
for
only
when
humour
illuminated
that
mind
did
it
become
truly
profound
in
the
of
erasmus
gave
something
that
no
one
else
could
have
given
to
the
world

years
later

comes
to

again
on

to

to
have
the

by

every
trace
of

has
been
obliterated
of
the

during

period
he
wrote

received
not

perhaps
it
was
the
happiest
time
of

for
it
was
partly
spent
with
his
tried
patron
mountjoy
and
also
in
the
house
of
more
in
that
noble
and
witty
circle
which
to
erasmus
appeared
ideal
that
house
was
also
frequented
by
the
friend
whom
erasmus
had
made
during
his
former
sojourn
in
england
and
whose
mind
was
perhaps
more
congenial
to
him
than

other
andrew
ammonius
it
is
not
improbable
that
during
these
months
he
was
able
to
work
without
interruption
at
the
studies
to
which
he
was
irresistibly
attracted
without
cares
as
to
the
immediate
future
and
not
yet
burdened
by
excessive
renown
which
afterwards
was
to
cause
him
as
much
trouble
and
loss
as
joy
that
future
was
still
uncertain
as
soon
as
he
no
longer
enjoys
hospitality
the
difficulties
and
complaints
recommence
continual
poverty
uncertainty
and
dependence
were
extraordinarily
galling
to
a
mind
requiring
above
all
things
liberty
at

charged
badius
with
a
new
revised

of

the

still
be

at
a
moderate
price

was
reprinted
at
strassburg
as
early
as
with
a
courteous
letter
by
jacob
wimpfeling
to

but
evidently
without

being
consulted
in
the
matter
by
that
time

was

up
in

this
may
sound
somewhat
gloomier
than
it
was
meant
but
a
few
weeks
later
he
writes
again
this
begging
you
laugh
at
me
i
know
but
i
hate
myself
for
it
and
am
fully
determined
either
to
obtain

replies

delicate

who

he
bitterly
regrets
having
left

italy
how
prosperity
had
smiled
upon
him
there
in
the

way
he
would
afterwards
lament
that
he
had
not
permanently
established
himself
in
england
if
he
had
only
embraced
the
opportunity
he
thinks
was
not
erasmus
rather
one
of
those
people
whom
good
fortune
can
not
help
he
remained
in
trouble
and
his
tone
grows
more
bitter
am
preparing
some
bait
against
the
of
january
though
it
is
pretty
sure
to
be
in
vain
he
writes
to
ammonius
referring
to
new
translations
of
lucian
and
plutarch
at
cambridge
erasmus
lectured
on
divinity
and
greek
but
it
brought
him
little
success
and
still
less
profit
the
prebend
indeed
had
at
last
been
given
him
in
the
form
of
the
rectory
of
aldington
in
kent
to
which
archbishop
william
warham
his
patron
appointed
him
in
instead
of
residing
he
was
allowed
to
draw
a
pension
of
twenty
pounds
a
year
the
archbishop
affirms
explicitly
that
contrary
to
his
custom
he
had
granted
this
favour
to
erasmus
because
he
light
of
learning
in
latin
and
greek
literature
had
out
of
love
for
england
disdained
to
live
in
italy
france
or
germany
in
order
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
here
with
his
friends
we
see
how
nations
already
begin
to
vie
with
each
other
for
the
honour
of
sheltering
erasmus
relief
from
all
cares
the
post
did
not
bring
intercourse
and
correspondence
with
colet
was
a
little
soured
under
the
light
veil
of
jests
and
kindness
by
his
constant
need
of
money
seeking
new
resources
by
undertaking
new
labours
or
preparing
new
editions
of
his
old
books
remained
a
hard
necessity
for
erasmus
the
great
works
upon
which
he
had
set
his
heart
and
to
which
he
had
given
all
his
energies
at
cambridge
held
out
no
promise
of
immediate
profit
his
serious
theological
labours
ranked
above
all
others
and
in
these
hard
years
he
devoted
his
best
strength
to
preparation
for
the
great
edition
of
jerome
works
and
emendation
of
the
text
of
the
new
testament
a
task
inspired
encouraged
and
promoted
by
colet
for
his
living
other
books
had
to
serve
he
had
a
sufficient
number
now
and
the
printers
were
eager
enough
about
them
though
the
profit
which
the
author
made
by
them
was
not
large
after
leaving
aldus
at
venice
erasmus
had
returned
to
the
publisher
who
had
printed
for
him
as
early
as
josse
badius
of
brabant
who
at
paris
had
established
the
ascensian
press
called
after
his
native
place
assche
and
who

scholar
himself
rivalled
aldus
in
point
of
the
accuracy
of
his
editions
of
the
classics
at
the
time
when
erasmus
took
the
to
gourmont
at
paris
he
had
charged
badius
with
a
new
edition
still
to
be
revised
of
the
why
the
was
published
by
another
we
can
not
tell
perhaps
badius
did
not
like
it
at
first
from
the
he
promised
himself
the
more
profit
but
that
was
a
long
work
the
alterations
and
preface
of
which
he
was
still
waiting
for
erasmus
to
send
he
felt
very
sure
of
his
ground
for
everyone
knew
that
he
badius
was
preparing
the
new
edition
yet
a
rumour
reached
him
that
in
germany
the
aldine
edition
was
being
reprinted
so
there
was
some
hurry
to
finish
it
he
wrote
to
erasmus
in
may
badius
meanwhile
had
much
more
work
of
erasmus
in
hand
or
on
approval
the
which
shortly
afterwards
was
published
by
him
the
of
which
at
the
same
time
a
new
edition
the
fifth
already
had
appeared
the
dialogues
by
lucian
the
euripides
and
seneca
translations
which
were
to
follow
he
hoped
to
add
jerome
letters
to
these
for
the
they
had
agreed
upon
a
of
fifteen
guilders
for
jerome
letters
badius
was
willing
to
give
the
same
sum
and
as
much
again
for
the
rest
of
the
consignment
you
will
say
what
a
very
small
sum
i
own
that
by
no
remuneration
could
your
genius
industry
knowledge
and
labour
be
requited
but
the
gods
will
requite
you
and
your
own
virtue
will
be
the
finest
reward
you
have
already
deserved
exceedingly
well
of
greek
and
roman
literature
you
will
in
this
same
way
deserve
well
of
sacred
and
divine
and
you
will
help
your
little
badius
who
has
a
numerous
family
and
no
earnings
besides
his
daily
trade
erasmus
must
have
smiled
ruefully
on
receiving
badius
letter
but
he
accepted
the
proposal
readily
he
promised
to
prepare
everything
for
the
press
and
on
january
he
finished
in
london
the
preface
to
the
revised
for
which
badius
was
waiting
but
then
something
happened
an
agent
who
acted
as
a
mediator
with
authors
for
several
publishers
in
germany
and
france
one
francis
berckman
of
cologne
took
the
revised
copy
of
the
with
the
preface
entrusted
to
him
by
erasmus
to
hand
over
to
badius
not
to
paris
but
to
basle
to
johannes
froben
who
had
just
without
erasmus
leave
reprinted
the
venetian
edition
erasmus
pretended
to
be
indignant
at
this
mistake
or
perfidy
but
it
is
only
too
clear
that
he
did
not
regret
it
six
months
later
he
betook
himself
with
bag
and
baggage
to
basle
to
enter
with
that
same
froben
into
those
most
cordial
relations
by
which
their
names
are
united
beatus
rhenanus
afterwards
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
a
connection
with
the
house
of
froben
then
still
called
amerbach
and
froben
had
seemed
attractive
to
erasmus
ever
since
he
had
heard
of
the
being
reprinted
without
conclusive
proofs
of
his
complicity
we
do
not
like
to
accuse
erasmus
of
perfidy
towards
badius
though
his
attitude
is
curious
to
say
the
least
but
we
do
want
to
commemorate
the
dignified
tone
in
which
badius
who
held
strict
notions
as
those
times
went
about
copyright
replied
when
berckman
afterwards
had
come
to
offer
him
a
sort
of
explanation
of
the
case
he
declares
himself
satisfied
though
erasmus
had
since
that
time
caused
him
losses
in
more
ways
amongst
others
by
printing
a
new
edition
of
the
at
strassburg
however
it
is
agreeable
to
your
interests
and
honour
i
shall
suffer
it
and
that
with
equanimity
their
relations
were
not
broken
off
in
all
this
we
should
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
publishing
at
that
time
was
yet
a
quite
new
commercial
phenomenon
and
that
new
commercial
forms
and
relations
of
trade
are
wont
to
be
characterized
by
uncertainty
confusion
and
lack
of
established
business
morals
the
stay
at
cambridge
gradually
became
irksome
to
erasmus
some
months
already
he
writes
to
ammonius
in
november
have
been
leading
a
true
snail
life
staying
at
home
and
plodding
it
is
very
lonely
here
most
people
have
gone
for
fear
of
the
plague
but
even
when
they
are
all
here
it
is
lonely
the
cost
of
sustenance
is
unbearable
and
he
makes
no
money
at
all
if
he
does
not
succeed
that
winter
in
making
a
nest
for
himself
he
is
resolved
to
fly
away
he
does
not
know
where
to
no
other
end
to
die
elsewhere
added
to
the
stress
of
circumstances
the
plague
reappearing
again
and
again
and
attacks
of
his
there
came
the
state
of
war
which
depressed
and
alarmed
erasmus
in
the
spring
of
the
english
raid
on
france
long
prepared
took
place
in
with
maximilian
army
the
english
had
beaten
the
french
near
guinegate
and
compelled
therouanne
to
surrender
and
afterwards
tournay
meanwhile
the
scotch
invaded
england
to
be
decisively
beaten

alexander

of

fame
henry
viii
returned
in
november
to
meet
his
parliament
erasmus
did
not
share
the
universal
joy
and
enthusiastic
admiration
are
circumscribed
here
by
the
plague
threatened
by
robbers
we
drink
wine
of
the
worst
because
there
is
no
import
from

but
triumphe
we
are
the
conquerors
of
the
world
his
deep
aversion
to
the
clamour
of
war
and
all
it
represented
stimulated
erasmus
satirical
faculties
it
is
true
that
he
flattered
the
english
national
pride
by
an
epigram
on
the
rout
of
the
french
near
guinegate
but
soon
he
went
deeper
he
remembered
how
war
had
impeded
his
movements
in
italy
how
the
entry
of
the
julius
ii
into
bologna
had
outraged
his
feelings
high
priest
julius
wages
war
conquers
triumphs
and
truly
plays
the
part
of
julius
caesar
he
had
written
then
pope
julius
he
thought
had
been
the
cause
of
all
the
wars
spreading
more
and
more
over
europe
now
the
pope
had
died
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
in
the
deepest
secrecy
between
his
work
on
the
new
testament
and
jerome
erasmus
took
revenge
on
the
martial
pope
for
the
misery
of
the
times
by
writing
the
masterly
satire
entitled
in
which
the
pope
appears
in
all
his
glory
before
the
gate
of
the
heavenly
paradise
to
plead
his
cause
and
find
himself
excluded
the
theme
was
not
new
to
him
for
had
he
not
made
something
similar
in
the
witty
cain
fable
by
which
at
one
time
he
had
cheered
a
at
oxford
but
that
was
an
innocent
jest
to
which
his
pious
had
listened
with
pleasure
to
the
satire
about
the
defunct
pope
many
would
no
doubt
also
gladly
listen
but
erasmus
had
to
be
careful
about
it
the
folly
of
all
the
world
might
be
ridiculed
but
not
the
worldly
propensities
of
the
recently
deceased
pope
therefore
though
he
helped
in
circulating
copies
of
the
manuscript
erasmus
did
his
utmost
for
the
rest
of
his
life
to
preserve
its
anonymity
and
when
it
was
universally
known
and
had
appeared
in
print
and
he
was
presumed
to
be
the
author
he
always
cautiously
denied
the
fact
although
he
was
careful
to
use
such
terms
as
to
avoid
a
formal
denial
the
first
edition
of
the
was
published
at
basle
not
by
froben
erasmus
ordinary
publisher
but
by
cratander
probably
in
the
year
erasmus
need
of
protesting
against
warfare
had
not
been
satisfied
by
writing
the
in
march
no
longer
at
cambridge
but
in
london
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
former
patron
the
abbot
of
saint
bertin
anthony
of
bergen
in
which
he
enlarges
upon
the
folly
of
waging
war
would
that
a
christian
peace
were
concluded
between
christian
princes
perhaps
the
abbot
might
contribute
to
that
consummation
through
his
influence
with
the
youthful
charles
v
and
especially
with
his
grandfather
maximilian
erasmus
states
quite
frankly
that
the
war
has
suddenly
changed
the
spirit
of
england
he
would
like
to
return
to
his
native
country
if
the
prince
would
procure
him
the
means
to
live
there
in
peace
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
and
of
true
erasmian
naïveté
that
he
can
not
help
mixing
up
his
personal
interests
with
his
sincere
indignation
at
the
atrocities
disgracing
a
man
and
a
christian
war
has
suddenly
altered
the
spirit
of
this
island
the
cost
of
living
rises
every
day
and
generosity
decreases
through
lack
of
wine
i
nearly
perished
by
gravel
contracted
by
taking
bad
stuff
we
are
confined
in
this
island
more
than
ever
so
that
even
letters
are
not
carried
abroad
this
was
the
first
of
erasmus
writings
he
expanded
it
into
the
adage
bellum
which
was
inserted
into
the
edition
of
published
by
froben
and
afterwards
also
printed
separately
hereafter
we
shall
follow
up
this
line
of
ideas
as
a
whole
though
the
summer
of
was
to
bring
peace
between
england
and
france
erasmus
had
now
definitely
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
england
he
sent
his
trunks
to
antwerp
to
his
friend
peter
gilles
and
prepared
to
go
to
the
netherlands
after
a
short
visit
to
mountjoy
at
the
castle
of
hammes
near
calais
shortly
before
his
departure
from
london
he
had
a
curious
interview
with
a
papal
diplomat
working
in
the
cause
of
peace
count
canossa
at
ammonius
house
on
the
thames
ammonius
passed
him
off
on
erasmus
as
a
merchant
after
the
meal
the
italian
sounded
him
as
to
a
possible
return
to
rome
where
he
might
be
the
first
in
place
instead
of
living
alone
among
a
barbarous
nation
erasmus
replied
that
he
lived
in
a
land
that
contained
the
greatest
number
of
excellent
scholars
among
whom
he
would
be
content
with
the
humblest
place
this
compliment
was
his
farewell
to
england
which
had
favoured
him
so
some
days
later
in
the
first
half
of
july
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
on
three
more
occasions
he
paid
short
visits
to
england
but
he
lived
there

at

erasmus
had
as
was
usual
with
him
enveloped
his
departure
from
england
with
mystery
it
was
given
out
that
he
was
going
to
rome
to
redeem
a
pledge
probably
he
had
already
determined
to
try
his
fortune
in
the
netherlands
not
in
holland
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
princely
court
in
brabant
the
chief
object
of
his
journey
however
was
to
visit
froben
at
basle
personally
to
supervise
the
publication
of
the
numerous
works
old
and
new
which
he
brought
with
him
among
them
the
material
for
his
chosen
task
the
new
testament
and
jerome
by
which
he
hoped
to
effect
the
restoration
of
theology
which
he
had
long
felt
to
be
his
it
is
easy
thus
to
imagine
his
anxiety
when
during
the
crossing
he
discovered
that
his
containing
the
manuscripts
was
found
to
have
been
taken
on
board
another
ship
he
felt
bereft
having
lost
the
labour
of
so
many
years
a
sorrow
so
great
he
writes
as
only
parents
can
feel
at
the
loss
of
their
children
to
his
joy
however
he
found
his
manuscripts
safe
on
the
other
side
at
the
castle
of
hammes
near
calais
he
stayed
for
some
days
the
guest
of
mountjoy
there
on
july
a
letter
found
him
written
on
april
by
his
superior
the
prior
of
steyn
his
old
friend
servatius
rogerus
recalling
him
to
the
monastery
after
so
many
years
of
absence
the
letter
had
already
been
in
the
hands
of
more
than
one
prying
person
before
it
reached
him
by
mere
chance
it
was
a
terrific
blow
which
struck
him
in
the
midst
of
his
course
to
his
highest
aspirations
erasmus
took
counsel
for
a
day
and
then
sent
a
refusal
to
his
old
friend
in
addressing
whom
he
always
found
the
most
serious
accents
of
his
being
he
wrote
a
letter
which
he
meant
to
be
a
justification
and
which
was
much
deeper
and
more
sincere
than
the
one
which
at
a
momentous
of
his
life
had
drawn
from
him
his
he
calls
upon
god
to
be
his
witness
that
he
would
follow
the
purest
inspiration
of
his
life
but
to
return
to
the
monastery
he
reminds
servatius
of
the
circumstances
under
which
he
entered
it
as
they
lived
in
his
memory
the
pressure
of
his
relations
his
false
modesty
he
points
out
to
him
how
ill
monastic
life
had
suited
his
constitution
how
it
outraged
his
love
of
freedom
how
detrimental
it
would
be
to
his
delicate
health
if
now
resumed
had
he
then
lived
a
worse
life
in
the
world
literature
had
kept
him
from
many
vices
his
restless
life
could
not
redound
to
his
dishonour
though
only
with
diffidence
did
he
dare
to
appeal
to
the
examples
of
solon
pythagoras
paul
and
his
favourite
jerome
had
he
not
everywhere
won
recognition
from
friends
and
patrons
he
enumerates
them
cardinals
archbishops
bishops
mountjoy
the
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
and
lastly
john
colet
was
there
then
any
objection
to
his
works
the
the
he
did
not
mention
the
the
best
was
still
to
follow
jerome
and
the
new
testament
the
fact
that
since
his
stay
in
italy
he
had
laid
aside
the
habit
of
his
order
and
wore
a
common
clerical
dress
he
could
excuse
on
a
number
of
grounds
the
conclusion
was
i
shall
not
return
to
holland
know
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
stand
the
air
and
the
food
there
all
eyes
will
be
directed
to
me
i
shall
return
to
the
country
an
old
and
grey
man
who
left
it
as
a
youth
i
shall
return
a
valetudinarian
i
shall
be
exposed
to
the
contempt
even
of
the
lowest
i
who
am
accustomed
to
be
honoured
even
by
the
greatest
is
not
possible
he
concludes
speak
out
frankly
in
a
letter
i
am
now
going
to
basle
and
thence
to
rome
perhaps
but
on
my
return
i
shall
try
to
visit
you
i
have
heard
of
the
deaths
of
william
francis
and
andrew
his
old
dutch
friends
remember
me
to
master
henry
and
the
others
who
live
with
you
i
am
disposed
towards
them
as
befits
me
for
those
old
tragedies
i
ascribe
to
my
errors
or
if
you
like
to
my
fate
do
not
omit
to
commend
me
to
christ
in
your
prayers
if
i
knew
for
sure
that
it
would
be
pleasing
to
him
that
i
should
return
to
live
with
you
i
should
prepare
for
the
journey
this
very
day
farewell
my
former
sweetest
companion
now
my
venerable
father
underlying
the
immediate
motives
of
his
high
theological
aspirations
this
refusal
was
doubtless
actuated
by
his
ancient
inveterate
psychological
incentives
of
disgust
and
shame
through
the
southern
netherlands
where
he
visited
several
friends
and
patrons
and
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
the
university
of
louvain
erasmus
turned
to
the
rhine
and
reached
basle
in
the
second
half
of
august
there
such
pleasures
of
fame
awaited
him
as
he
had
never
yet
tasted
the
german
humanists
hailed
him
as
the
light
of
the
world
in
letters
receptions
and
banquets
they
were
more
solemn
and
enthusiastic
than
erasmus
had
found
the
scholars
of
france
england
and
italy
to
say
nothing
of
his
compatriots
and
they
applauded
him
emphatically
as
being
a
german
himself
and
an
ornament
of
germany
at
his
first
meeting
with
froben
erasmus
permitted
himself
the
pleasure
of
a
jocular
deception
he
pretended
to
be
a
friend
and
agent
of
himself
to
enjoy
to
the
full
the
joy
of
being
recognized
the
german
environment
was
rather
to
his
mind
germany
which
to
my
regret
and
shame
i
got
to
know
so
late
soon
the
work
for
which
he
had
come
was
in
full
swing
he
was
in
his
element
once
more
as
he
had
been
at
venice
six
years
before
working
hard
in
a
large
surrounded
by
scholars
who
heaped
upon
him
homage
and
kindness
in
those
rare
moments
of
leisure
which
he
permitted
himself
move
in
a
most
agreeable
museon
so
many
men
of
learning
and
of
such
exceptional
learning
some
translations
of
the
lesser
works
of
plutarch
were
published
by
froben
in
august
the
was
passing
through
the
press
again
with
corrections
and
additions
and
the
preface
which
was
originally
destined
for
badius
at
the
same
time
dirck
maertensz
at
louvain
was
also
at
work
for
erasmus
who
had
on
passing
through
the
town
entrusted
him
with
a
collection
of
easy
latin
texts
also
schürer
at
strassburg
who
prepared
the
sive
for
him
for
froben
too
erasmus
was
engaged
on
a
seneca
which
appeared
in
together
with
a
work
on
latin
construction
but
jerome
and
the
new
testament
remained
his
chief
occupation
jerome
works
had
been
erasmus
love
in
early
youth
especially
his
letters
the
plan
of
preparing
a
correct
edition
of
the
great
father
of
the
church
was
conceived
in
if
not
earlier
and
he
had
worked
at
it
ever
since
at
intervals
in
he
writes
to
ammonius
enthusiasm
for
emending
and
annotating
jerome
is
such
that
i
feel
as
though
inspired
by
some
god
i
have
almost
completely
emended
him
already
by
collating
many
old
manuscripts
and
this
i
do
at
incredibly
great
expense
in
he
negotiated
with
badius
about
an
edition
of
the
letters
froben
partner
johannes
amerbach
who
died
before
erasmus
arrival
had
been
engaged
for
years
on
an
edition
of
jerome
several
scholars
reuchlin
among
others
had
assisted
in
the
undertaking
when
erasmus
offered
himself
and
all
his
material
he
became
the
actual
editor
of
the
nine
volumes
in
which
froben
published
the
work
in
the
first
four
contained
erasmus
edition
of
jerome
letters
the
others
had
been
corrected
by
him
and
provided
with
forewords
his
work
upon
the
new
testament
was
if
possible
still
nearer
his
heart
by
its
growth
it
had
gradually
changed
its
nature
since
the
time
when
valla
had
directed
his
attention
to
textual
criticism
of
the
vulgate
erasmus
had
probably
during
his
second
stay
in
england
from
to
at
the
instance
of
colet
made
a
new
translation
of
the
new
testament
from
the
greek
original
which
translation
differed
greatly
from
the
vulgate
besides
colet
few
had
seen
it
later
erasmus
understood
it
was
necessary
to
publish
also
a
new
edition
of
the
greek
text
with
his
notes
as
to
this
he
had
made
a
provisional
arrangement
with
froben
shortly
after
his
arrival
at
basle
afterwards
he
considered
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
printed
in
italy
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
there
when
possibly
persuaded
by
new
offers
from
froben
he
suddenly
changed
his
plan
of
travel
and
in
the
spring
of
made
a
short
trip
to
england
probably
among
other
reasons
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
copy
of
his
translation
of
the
new
testament
which
he
had
left
behind
there
in
the
summer
he
was
back
at
basle
and
resumed
the
work
in
froben
in
the
beginning
of
the
appeared
containing
the
purified
greek
text
with
notes
together
with
a
latin
translation
in
which
erasmus
had
altered
too
great
deviations
from
the
vulgate
from
the
moment
of
the
appearance
of
two
such
important
and
as
regards
the
second
such
daring
theological
works
by
erasmus
as
jerome
and
the
new
testament
we
may
say
that
he
had
made
himself
the
centre
of
the
scientific
study
of
divinity
as
he
was
at
the
same
time
the
centre
and
touchstone
of
classic
erudition
and
literary
taste
his
authority
constantly
increased
in
all
countries
his
correspondence
was
prodigiously
augmented
but
while
his
mental
growth
was
accomplished
his
financial
position
was
not
assured
the
years
to
are
among
the
most
restless
of
his
life
he
is
still
looking
out
for
every
chance
which
presents
itself
a
canonry
at
tournay
a
prebend
in
england
a
bishopric
in
sicily
always
half
jocularly
regretting
the
good
chances
he
missed
in
former
times
jesting
about
his
pursuit
of
fortune
lamenting
about
his
execrable
poverty
which
even
yet
i
have
not
succeeded
in
shaking
off
my
shoulders
and
after
all
ever
more
the
victim
of
his
own
restlessness
than
of
the
disfavour
of
fate
he
is
now
fifty
years
old
and
still
he
is
as
he
says
without
knowing
what
i
shall
reap
this
however
only
refers
to
his
career
not
to
his
in
the
course
of
a
new
and
promising
patron
john
le
sauvage
chancellor
of
brabant
had
succeeded
in
procuring
for
him
the
title
of
councillor
of
the
prince
the
youthful
charles
in
the
beginning
of
he
was
nominated
it
was
a
mere
title
of
honour
promising
a
yearly
pension
of
florins
which
however
was
paid
but
irregularly
to
habilitate
himself
as
a
councillor
of
the
prince
erasmus
wrote
the
principis
a
treatise
about
the
education
of
a
prince
which
in
accordance
with
erasmus
nature
and
inclination
deals
rather
with
moral
than
with
political
matters
and
is
in
striking
contrast
with
that
other
work
written
some
years
earlier
by
machiavelli
when
his
work
at
basle
ceased
for
the
time
being
in
the
spring
of
erasmus
journeyed
to
the
netherlands
at
brussels
he
met
the
chancellor
who
in
addition
to
the
prince
pension
procured
him
a
prebend
at
courtray
which
like
the
english
benefice
mentioned
above
was
compounded
for
by
money
payments
at
antwerp
lived
one
of
the
great
friends
who
helped
in
his
support
all
his
life
peter
gilles
the
young
town
clerk
in
whose
house
he
stayed
as
often
as
he
came
to
antwerp
peter
gilles
is
the
man
who
figures
in
more
as
the
person
in
whose
garden
the
sailor
tells
his
experiences
it
was
in
these
days
that
gilles
helped
dirck
maertensz
at
louvain
to
pass
the
first
edition
of
the
through
the
press
later
quentin
metsys
was
to
paint
him
and
erasmus
joined
in
a
diptych
a
present
for
thomas
more
and
for
us
a
vivid
memorial
of
one
of
the
best
things
erasmus
ever
knew
this
triple
friendship
in
the
summer
of
erasmus
made
another
short
trip
to
england
he
stayed
with
more
saw
colet
again
also
warham
fisher
and
the
other
friends
but
it
was
not
to
visit
old
friends
that
he
went
there
a
pressing
and
delicate
matter
impelled
him
now
that
prebends
and
church
dignities
began
to
be
presented
to
him
it
was
more
urgent
than
ever
that
the
impediments
in
the
way
of
a
free
ecclesiastical
career
should
be
permanently
obviated
he
was
provided
with
a
dispensation
of
pope
julius
ii
authorizing
him
to
accept
english
prebends
and
another
exempting
him
from
the
obligation
of
wearing
the
habit
of
his
order
but
both
were
of
limited
scope
and
insufficient
the
fervent
impatience
with
which
he
conducted
this
matter
of
his
definite
discharge
from
the
order
makes
it
probable
that
as
allen
presumes
the
threat
of
his
recall
to
steyn
had
since
his
refusal
to
servatius
in
hung
over
his
head
there
was
nothing
he
feared
and
detested
so
much
with
his
friend
ammonius
he
drew
up
in
london
a
very
elaborate
paper
addressed
to
the
apostolic
chancery
in
which
he
recounts
the
story
of
his
own
life
as
that
of
one
florentius
his
entrance
to
the
monastery
the
troubles
which
monastic
life
had
brought
him
the
circumstances
which
had
induced
him
to
lay
his
monk
dress
aside
it
is
a
passionate
apology
pathetic
and
ornate
the
letter
as
we
know
it
does
not
contain
a
direct
request
in
an
appendix
at
the
end
written
in
cipher
of
which
he
sent
the
key
in
sympathetic
ink
in
another
letter
the
chancery
was
requested
to
obviate
the
impediments
which
illegitimate
birth
placed
in
the
way
of
his
promotion
the
addressee
lambertus
grunnius
apostolic
secretary
was
most
probably
an
imaginary
personage
so
much
mystery
did
erasmus
use
when
his
vital
interests
were
at
stake
the
bishop
of
worcester
silvestro
gigli
who
was
setting
out
to
the
lateran
council
as
the
envoy
of
england
took
upon
himself
to
deliver
the
letter
and
to
plead
erasmus
cause
erasmus
having
meanwhile
at
the
end
of
august
returned
to
the
netherlands
awaited
the
upshot
of
his
kind
offices
in
the
greatest
suspense
the
matter
was
finally
settled
in
january
in
two
letters
bearing
the
signature
of
sadolet
leo
x
condoned
erasmus
transgressions
of
ecclesiastical
law
relieved
him
of
the
obligation
to
wear
the
dress
of
his
order
allowed
him
to
live
in
the
world
and
authorized
him
to
hold
church
benefices
in
spite
of
any
disqualifications
arising
from
illegitimacy
of
birth
so
much
his
great
fame
had
now
achieved
the
pope
had
moreover
accepted
the
dedication
of
the
edition
of
the
new
testament
and
had
through
sadolet
expressed
himself
in
very
gracious
terms
about
erasmus
work
in
general
rome
itself
seemed
to
further
his
endeavours
in
all
respects
erasmus
now
thought
of
establishing
himself
permanently
in
the
netherlands
to
which
everything
pointed
louvain
seemed
to
be
the
most
suitable
abode
the
centre
of
studies
where
he
had
already
spent
two
years
in
former
times
but
louvain
did
not
attract
him
it
was
the
stronghold
of
conservative
theology
martin
van
dorp
a
dutchman
like
erasmus
and
professor
of
divinity
at
louvain
had
in
in
the
name
of
his
faculty
rebuked
erasmus
in
a
letter
for
the
audacity
of
the
of
his
derision
of
divines
and
also
his
temerity
in
correcting
the
text
of
the
new
testament
erasmus
had
defended
himself
elaborately
at
present
war
was
being
waged
in
a
much
wider
field
for
or
against
reuchlin
the
great
hebrew
scholar
for
whom
the
authors
of
the
obscurorum
had
so
sensationally
taken
up
the
cudgels
at
louvain
erasmus
was
regarded
with
the
same
suspicion
with
which
he
distrusted
dorp
and
the
other
louvain
divines
he
stayed
during
the
remainder
of
and
the
first
half
of
at
antwerp
brussels
and
ghent
often
in
the
house
of
peter
gilles
in
february
there
came
tempting
offers
from
france
budaeus
cop
étienne
poncher
bishop
of
paris
wrote
to
him
that
the
king
the
youthful
francis
i
would
present
him
with
a
generous
prebend
if
he
would
come
to
paris
erasmus
always
shy
of
being
tied
down
only
wrote
polite
evasive
answers
and
did
not
go
in
the
meantime
he
received
the
news
of
the
papal
absolution
in
connection
with
this
he
had
once
more
to
visit
england
little
dreaming
that
it
would
be
the
last
time
he
should
set
foot
on
british
soil
in
ammonius
house
of
saint
stephen
chapel
at
westminster
on
april
the
ceremony
of
absolution
took
place
ridding
erasmus
for
good
of
the
nightmare
which
had
oppressed
him
since
his
youth
at
last
he
was
free
invitations
and
specious
promises
now
came
to
him
from
all
sides
mountjoy
and
wolsey
spoke
of
high
ecclesiastical
honours
which
awaited
him
in
england
budaeus
kept
pressing
him
to
remove
to
france
cardinal
ximenes
wanted
to
attach
him
to
the
university
of
alcalá
in
spain
the
duke
of
saxony
offered
him
a
chair
at
leipzig
pirckheimer
boasted
of
the
perfections
of
the
free
imperial
city
of
nuremberg
erasmus
meanwhile
overwhelmed
again
with
the
labour
of
writing
and
editing
according
to
his
wont
did
not
definitely
decline
any
of
these
offers
neither
did
he
accept
any
he
always
wanted
to
keep
all
his
strings
on
his
bow
at
the
same
time
in
the
early
summer
of
he
was
asked
to
accompany
the
court
of
the
youthful
charles
who
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
netherlands
for
spain
but
he
declined
his
departure
to
spain
would
have
meant
a
long
interruption
of
immediate
contact
with
the
great
publishing
centres
basle
louvain
strassburg
paris
and
that
in
turn
would
have
meant
postponement
of
his
when
in
the
beginning
of
july
the
prince
set
out
for
middelburg
there
to
take
ship
for
spain
erasmus
started
for
louvain
he
was
thus
destined
to
go
to
this
university
environment
although
it
displeased
him
in
so
many
respects
there
he
would
have
academic
duties
young
latinists
would
follow
him
about
to
get
their
poems
and
letters
corrected
by
him
and
all
those
divines
whom
he
distrusted
would
watch
him
at
close
quarters
but
it
was
only
to
be
for
a
few
months
have
removed
to
louvain
he
writes
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
i
shall
decide
which
residence
is
best
suited
to
old
age
which
is
already
knocking
at
the
gate
importunately
as
it
turned
out
he
was
to
spend
four
years
at
louvain
his
life
was
now
becoming
more
stationary
but
because
of
outward
circumstances
rather
than
of
inward
quiet
he
kept
deliberating
all
those
years
whether
he
should
go
to
england
germany
or
france
hoping
at
last
to
find
the
brilliant
position
which
he
had
always
coveted
and
never
had
been
able
or
willing
to
grasp
the
years
may
be
called
the
culmination
of
erasmus
career
applauding
crowds
surrounded
him
more
and
more
the
minds
of
men
were
seemingly
prepared
for
something
great
to
happen
and
they
looked
to
erasmus
as
the
man
at
brussels
he
was
continually
bothered
with
visits
from
spaniards
italians
and
germans
who
wanted
to
boast
of
their
interviews
with
him
the
spaniards
with
their
verbose
solemnity
particularly
bored
him
most
exuberant
of
all
were
the
eulogies
with
which
the
german
humanists
greeted
him
in
their
letters
this
had
begun
already
on
his
first
journey
to
basle
in
rotterdamer
of
germany
of
the
world
were
some
of
the
simplest
effusions
town
councils
waited
upon
him
presents
of
wine
and
public
banquets
were
of
common
occurrence
no
one
expresses
himself
so
hyperbolically
as
the
jurist
ulrich
zasius
of
freiburg
am
pointed
out
in
public
he
asserts
the
man
who
has
received
a
letter
from
erasmus
greatest
hero
you
great
jove
is
a
moderate
apostrophe
for
him
swiss
zwingli
writes
in
it
a
great
glory
to
have
seen
erasmus
know
and
i
teach
nothing
but
erasmus
now
writes
wolfgang
capito
ulrich
von
hutten
and
henry
glareanus
both
imagine
themselves
placed
beside
erasmus
as
alcibiades
stood
beside
socrates
and
beatus
rhenanus
devotes
to
him
a
life
of
earnest
admiration
and
helpfulness
that
was
to
prove
of
much
more
value
than
these
exuberant
panegyrics
there
is
an
element
of
national
exaltation
in
this
german
enthusiasm
for
erasmus
it
is
the
violently
stimulated
mood
into
which
luther
word
will
fall
anon
the
other
nations
also
chimed
in
with
praise
though
a
little
later
and
a
little
more
soberly
colet
and
tunstall
promise
him
immortality
étienne
poncher
exalts
him
above
the
celebrated
italian
humanists
germain
de
brie
declares
that
french
scholars
have
ceased
reading
any
authors
but
erasmus
and
budaeus
announces
that
all
western
christendom
resounds
with
his
name
this
increase
of
glory
manifested
itself
in
different
ways
almost
every
year
the
rumour
of
his
death
was
spread
abroad
malignantly
as
he
himself
thinks
again
all
sorts
of
writings
were
ascribed
to
him
in
which
he
had
no
share
whatever
amongst
others
the
obscurorum
but
above
all
his
correspondence
increased
immensely
the
time
was
long
since
past
when
he
asked
more
to
procure
him
more
correspondents
letters
now
kept
pouring
in
to
him
from
all
sides
beseeching
him
to
reply
a
former
pupil
laments
with
tears
that
he
can
not
show
a
single
note
written
by
erasmus
scholars
respectfully
sought
an
introduction
from
one
of
his
friends
before
venturing
to
address
him
in
this
respect
erasmus
was
a
man
of
heroic
benevolence
and
tried
to
answer
what
he
could
although
so
overwhelmed
by
letters
every
day
that
he
hardly
found
time
to
read
them
i
do
not
answer
i
seem
unkind
says
erasmus
and
that
thought
was
intolerable
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
at
that
time
occupied
more
or
less
the
place
of
the
newspaper
at
present
or
rather
of
the
literary
monthly
which
arose
fairly
directly
out
of
erudite
correspondence
it
was
as
in
antiquity
which
in
this
respect
was
imitated
better
and
more
profitably
perhaps
than
in
any
other
sphere
an
art
even
before
erasmus
had
at
paris
described
that
art
in
the
treatise
conscribendis
which
was
to
appear
in
print
in
people
wrote
as
a
rule
with
a
view
to
later
publication
for
a
wider
circle
or
at
any
rate
with
the
certainty
that
the
recipient
would
show
the
letter
to
others
a
fine
latin
letter
was
a
gem
which
a
man
envied
his
neighbour
erasmus
writes
to
budaeus
has
devoured
your
letter
to
me
and
it
as
many
as
three
or
four
times
i
had
literally
to
tear
it
from
his
hands
unfortunately
fate
did
not
always
take
into
consideration
the
intentions
as
to
publicity
or
strict
secrecy
often
letters
passed
through
many
hands
before
reaching
their
destination
as
did
servatius

to
erasmus
in
be
careful
about
letters
he
writes
more
than
once
are
on
the
lookout
to
intercept
them
yet
with
the
curious
precipitation
that
characterizes
him
erasmus
was
often
very
careless
as
to
what
he
wrote
from
an
early
age
he
preserved
and
cared
for
his
letters
yet
nevertheless
through
his
itinerant
life
many
were
lost
he
could
not
control
their
publication
as
early
as
a
friend
sent
him
a
manuscript
volume
of
his
own
erasmus
letters
that
he
had
picked
up
for
sale
at
rome
erasmus
had
it
burnt
at
once
since
he
himself
superintended
the
publication
of
his
letters
at
first
only
a
few
important
ones
afterwards
in
a
selection
of
letters
from
friends
to
him
and
after
that
ever
larger
collections
till
at
the
end
of
his
life
there
appeared
a
new
collection
almost
every
year
no
article
was
so
much
in
demand
on
the
book
market
as
letters
by
erasmus
and
no
wonder
they
were
models
of
excellent
style
tasteful
latin
witty
expression
and
elegant
erudition
the
character
of
the
letters
often
made
them
compromising
what
one
could
say
to
a
friend
in
confidence
might
possibly
injure
when
many
read
it
erasmus
who
never
was
aware
how
injuriously
he
expressed
himself
repeatedly
gave
rise
to
misunderstanding
and
estrangement
manners
so
to
say
had
not
yet
adapted
themselves
to
the
new
art
of
printing
which
increased
the
publicity
of
the
written
word
a
thousandfold
only
gradually
under
this
new
influence
was
the
separation
effected
between
the
public
word
intended
for
the
press
and
the
private
communication
which
remains
in
writing
and
is
read
only
by
the
recipient
meanwhile
with
the
growth
of
erasmus
fame
his
earlier
writings
too
had
risen
in
the
public
estimation
the
great
success
of
the
militis
had
begun
about
when
the
times
were
much
riper
for
it
than
eleven
years
before
is
embraced
as
the
highest
wisdom
writes
john
watson
to
him
in
in
the
same
year
we
find
a
word
used
for
the
first
time
which
expresses
better
than
anything
else
how
much
erasmus
had
become
a
centre
of
authority
so
his
german
friends
called
themselves
according
to
johannes
sapidus
more
than
a
year
later
johannes
eck
employs
the
word
still
in
a
rather
friendly
sense
as
a
generally
current
term
scholars
in
germany
are
erasmians
he
says
but
erasmus
did
not
like
the
word
find
nothing
in
myself
he
replies
anyone
should
wish
to
be
an
erasmicus
and
altogether
i
hate
those
party
names
we
are
all
followers
of
christ
and
to
his
glory
we
all
drudge
each
for
his
part
but
he
knows
that
now
the
question
is
for
or
against
him
from
the
brilliant
latinist
and
the
man
of
wit
of
his
prime
he
had
become
the
international
pivot
on
which
the
civilization
of
his
age
hinged
he
could
not
help
beginning
to
feel
himself
the
brain
the
heart
and
the
conscience
of
his
times
it
might
even
appear
to
him
that
he
was
called
to
speak
the
great
redeeming
word
or
perhaps
that
he
had
already
spoken
it
the
faith
in
an
easy
triumph
of
pure
knowledge
and
christian
meekness

a
near
future

the
preface
of

edition
of
the
new
testament
how
clear
did
the
future
look
in
those
years
in
this
period
erasmus
repeatedly
reverts
to
the
glad
motif
of
a
golden
age
which
is
on
the
point
of
dawning
perennial
peace
is
before
the
door
the
highest
princes

francis

charles

henry

and

standard

we
may
congratulate
the
age
it
will
be
a
golden
one
but
erasmus
does
not
sound
this
note
long
it
is
heard
for
the
last
time
in
after
which
the
dream
of
universal
happiness
about

gives
place
to

made
erasmus
the
man
from
whom
his
contemporaries
expected
their
salvation
on
whose
lips
they
hung
to
catch
the
word
of
deliverance
he
seemed
to
them
the
bearer
of
a
new
liberty
of
the
mind
a
new
clearness
purity
and
simplicity
of
knowledge
a
new
harmony
of
healthy
and
right
living
he
was
to
them
as
the
possessor
of
newly
discovered
untold
wealth
which
he
had
only
to
distribute
what
was
there
in
the
mind
of
the
great
rotterdamer
which
promised
so
much
to
the
world
the
negative
aspect
of
erasmus
mind
may
be
defined
as
a
heartfelt
aversion
to
everything
unreasonable
insipid
purely
formal
with
which
the
undisturbed
growth
of
medieval
culture
had
overburdened
and
overcrowded
the
world
of
thought
as
often
as
he
thinks
of
the
ridiculous
out
of
which
latin
was
taught
in
his
youth
disgust
rises
in
his
mind
and
he
execrates
them
mammetrectus
brachylogus
ebrardus
and
all
the
rest
as
a
heap
of
rubbish
which
ought
to
be
cleared
away
but
this
aversion
to
the
superannuated
which
had
become
useless
and
soulless
extended
much
farther
he
found
society
and
especially
religious
life
full
of
practices
ceremonies
traditions
and
conceptions
from
which
the
spirit
seemed
to
have
departed
he
does
not
reject
them
offhand
and
altogether
what
revolts
him
is
that
they
are
so
often
performed
without
understanding
and
right
feeling
but
to
his
mind
highly
susceptible
to
the
foolish
and
ridiculous
things
and
with
a
delicate
need
of
high
decorum
and
inward
dignity
all
that
sphere
of
ceremony
and
tradition
displays
itself
as
a
useless
nay
a
hurtful
scene
of
human
stupidity
and
selfishness
and
intellectualist
as
he
is
with
his
contempt
for
ignorance
he
seems
unaware
that
those
religious
observances
after
all
may
contain
valuable
sentiments
of
unexpressed
and
unformulated
piety
through
his
treatises
his
letters
his
especially
there
always
passes
as
if
one
was
looking
at
a
gallery
of
pictures
a
procession
of
ignorant
and
covetous
monks
who
by
their
sanctimony
and
humbug
impose
upon
the
trustful
multitude
and
fare
sumptuously
themselves
as
a
fixed
motif
such
motifs
are
numerous
with
erasmus
there
always
recurs
his
gibe
about
the
superstition
that
a
person
was
saved
by
dying
in
the
gown
of
a
franciscan
or
a
dominican
fasting
prescribed
prayers
the
observance
of
holy
days
should
not
be
altogether
neglected
but
they
become
displeasing
to
god
when
we
repose
our
trust
in
them
and
forget
charity
the
same
holds
good
of
confession
indulgence
all
sorts
of
blessings
pilgrimages
are
worthless
the
veneration
of
the
saints
and
of
their
relics
is
full
of
superstition
and
foolishness
the
people
think
they
will
be
preserved
from
disasters
during
the
day
if
only
they
have
looked
at
the
painted
image
of
saint
christopher
in
the
morning
kiss
the
shoes
of
the
saints
and
their
dirty
handkerchiefs
and
we
leave

books
their
most
holy
and
efficacious
relics
neglected
erasmus
dislike
of
what
seemed
antiquated
and
worn
out
in
his
days
went
farther
still
it
comprised
the
whole
intellectual
scheme
of
medieval
theology
and
philosophy
in
the
syllogistic
system
he
found
only
subtlety
and
arid
ingenuity
all
symbolism
and
allegory
were
fundamentally
alien
to
him
and
indifferent
though
he
occasionally
tried
his
hand
at
an
allegory
and
he
never
was
mystically
inclined
now
here
it
is
just
as
much
the
deficiencies
of
his
own
mind
as
the
qualities
of
the
system
which
made
him
unable
to
appreciate
it
while
he
struck
at
the
abuse
of
ceremonies
and
of
church
practices
both
with
noble
indignation
and
mockery
a
proud
irony
to
which
he
was
not
fully
entitled
preponderates
in
his
condemnation
of
scholastic
theology
which
he
could
not
quite
understand
it
was
easy
always
to
talk
with
a
sneer
of
the
conservative
divines
of
his
time
as
his
noble
indignation
hurt
only
those
who
deserved
castigation
and
strengthened
what
was
valuable
but
his
mockery
hurt
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
in
spite
of
him
assailed
both
the
institution
and
persons
and
injured
without
elevating
them
the
individualist
erasmus
never
understood
what
it
meant
to
offend
the
honour
of
an
office
an
order
or
an
establishment
especially
when
that
institution
is
the
most
sacred
of
all
the
church
itself
erasmus
conception
of
the
church
was
no
longer
purely
catholic
of
that
glorious
structure
of
civilization
with
its
mystic
foundation
its
strict
hierarchic
construction
its
splendidly
fitting
symmetry
he
saw
hardly
anything
but
its
load
of
outward
details
and
ornament
instead
of
the
world
which
thomas
aquinas
and
dante
had
described
according
to
their
vision
erasmus
saw
another
world
full
of
charm
and
elevated
feeling
and
this
he
held
up
before
his
compatriots
illustration
xv
the
hands
of
erasmus
it
was
the
world
of
antiquity
but
illuminated
throughout
by
christian
faith
it
was
a
world
that
had
never
existed
as
such
for
with
the
historical
reality
which
the
times
of
constantine
and
the
great
fathers
of
the
church
had
manifested
that
of
declining
latinity
and
deteriorating
hellenism
the
oncoming
barbarism
and
the
oncoming
byzantinism
it
had
nothing
in
common
erasmus
imagined
world
was
an
amalgamation
of
pure
classicism
this
meant
for
him
cicero
horace
plutarch
for
to
the
flourishing
period
of
the
greek
mind
he
remained
after
all
a
stranger
and
pure
biblical
christianity
could
it
be
a
union
not
really
in
erasmus
mind
the
light
falls
just
as
we
saw
in
the
history
of
his
career
alternately
on
the
pagan
antique
and
on
the
christian
but
the
warp
of
his
mind
is
christian
his
classicism
only
serves
him
as
a
form
and
from
antiquity
he
only
chooses
those
elements
which
in
ethical
tendency
are
in
conformity
with
his
christian
ideal

erasmus
at
the
age
of
and
because
of
this
erasmus
although
he
appeared
after
a
century
of
earlier
humanism
is
yet
new
to
his
time
the
union
of
antiquity
and
the
christian
spirit
which
had
haunted
the
mind
of
petrarch
the
father
of
humanism
which
was
lost
sight
of
by
his
disciples
enchanted
as
they
were
by
the
irresistible
brilliance
of
the
antique
beauty
of
form
this
union
was
brought
about
by
erasmus
what
pure
latinity
and
the
classic
spirit
meant
to
erasmus
we
can
not
feel
as
he
did
because
its
realization
does
not
mean
to
us
as
to
him
a
difficult
conquest
and
a
glorious
triumph
to
feel
it
thus
one
must
have
acquired
in
a
hard
school
the
hatred
of
barbarism
which
already
during
his
first
years
of
authorship
had
suggested
the
composition
of
the
the
abusive
term
for
all
that
is
old
and
rude
is
already
gothic
goths
the
term
barbarism
as
used
by
erasmus
comprised
much
of
what
we
value
most
in
the
medieval
spirit
erasmus
conception
of
the
great
intellectual
crisis
of
his
day
was
distinctly
dualistic
he
saw
it
as
a
struggle
between
old
and
new
which
to
him
meant
evil
and
good
in
the
advocates
of
tradition
he
saw
only
obscurantism
conservatism
and
ignorant
opposition
to
that
is
the
good
cause
for
which
he
and
his
partisans
battled
of
the
rise
of
that
higher
culture
erasmus
had
already
formed
the
conception
which
has
since
dominated
the
history
of
the
renaissance
it
was
a
revival
begun
two
or
three
hundred
years
before
his
time
in
which
besides
literature
all
the
plastic
arts
shared
side
by

and
reflorescence

world
is
coming
to
its
senses
as
if
awaking
out
of
a
deep
sleep
still
there
are
some
left
who
recalcitrate
pertinaciously
clinging
convulsively
with
hands
and
feet
to
their
old
ignorance
they
fear
that
if
are
reborn
and
the
world
grows
wise
it
will
come
to
light
that
they
have
known
nothing
they
do
not
know
how
pious
the
ancients
could
be
what
sanctity
characterizes
socrates
virgil
and
horace
or
plutarch
how
rich
the
history
of
antiquity
is
in
examples
of
forgiveness
and
true
virtue
we
should
call
nothing
profane
that
is
pious
and
conduces
to
good
morals
no
more
dignified
view
of
life
was
ever
found
than
that
which
cicero
propounds
in
in
order
to
understand
erasmus
mind
and
the
charm
which
it
had
for
his
contemporaries
one
must
begin
with
the
ideal
of
life
that
was
present
before
his
inward
eye
as
a
splendid
dream
it
is
not
his
own
in
particular
the
whole
renaissance
cherished
that
wish
of
reposeful
blithe
and
yet
serious
intercourse
of
good
and
wise
friends
in
the
cool
shade
of
a
house
under
trees
where
serenity
and
harmony
would
dwell
the
age
yearned
for
the
realization
of
simplicity
sincerity
truth
and
nature
their
imagination
was
always
steeped
in
the
essence
of
antiquity
though
at
heart
it
is
more
nearly
connected
with
medieval
ideals
than
they
themselves
were
aware
in
the
circle
of
the
medici
it
is
the
idyll
of
careggi
in
rabelais
it
embodies
itself
in
the
fancy
of
the
abbey
of
thélème
it
finds
voice
in
more
and
in
the
work
of
montaigne
in
erasmus
writings
that
ideal
wish
ever
recurs
in
the
shape
of
a
friendly
walk
followed
by
a
meal
in
a
it
is
found
as
an
opening
scene
of
the
in
the
numerous
descriptions
of
meals
with
colet
and
the
numerous
of
the
especially
in
the
erasmus
has
elaborately
pictured
his
dream
and
it
would
be
worth
while
to
compare
it
on
the
one
hand
with
thélème
and
on
the
other
with
the
fantastic
design
of
a
pleasure
garden
which
bernard
palissy
describes
the
little
dutch
and
in
which
the
national
spirit
took
great
delight
are
the
fulfilment
of
a
purely
erasmian
ideal
the
host
of
the
says
me
a

is
pleasanter
than
any

if
he
be

lives

according

surely
i
am

here
life
true
joy
is

live
pleasantly
then
none
are
more
truly

in
holiness
and
piety
the
ideal
joy
of
life
is
also
perfectly
idyllic
in
so
far
that
it
requires
an
aloofness
from
earthly
concerns
and
contempt
for
all
that
is
sordid
it
is
foolish
to
be
interested
in
all
that
happens
in
the
world
to
pride
oneself
on
one
knowledge
of
the
market
of
the

from

conditions
in

the
sensible
old
man
of
the
has
an
easy
post
of
honour
a
safe
mediocrity
he
judges
no
one
and
nothing
and
smiles
upon
all
the
world
quiet
for
oneself
surrounded
by
books
that
is
of
all
things
most
desirable
on
the
outskirts
of
this
ideal
of
serenity
and
harmony
numerous
flowers
of
aesthetic
value
blow
such
as
erasmus
sense
of
decorum
his
great
need
of
kindly
courtesy
his
pleasure
in
gentle
and
obliging
treatment
in
cultured
and
easy
manners
close
by
are
some
of
his
intellectual
peculiarities
he
hates
the
violent
and
extravagant
therefore
the
choruses
of
the
greek
drama
displease
him
the
merit
of
his
own
poems
he
sees
in
the
fact
that
they
pass
passion
by
they
abstain
from
pathos
altogether
is
not
a
single
storm
in
them
no
mountain
torrent
overflowing
its
banks
no
exaggeration
whatever
there
is
great
frugality
in
words
my
poetry
would
rather
keep
within
bounds
than
exceed
them
rather
hug
the
shore
than
cleave
the
high
seas
in
another
place
he
says
am
always
most
pleased
by
a
poem
that
does
not
differ
too
much
from
prose
but
prose
of
the
best
sort
be
it
understood
as
philoxenus
accounted
those
the
most
palatable
fishes
that
are
no
true
fishes
and
the
most
savoury
meat
what
is
no
meat
the
most
pleasant
voyage
that
along
the
shores
and
the
most
agreeable
walk
that
along
the
water
edge
so
i
take
especial
pleasure
in
a
rhetorical
poem
and
a
poetical
oration
so
that
poetry
is
tasted
in
prose
and
the
reverse
that
is
the
man
of
of
fine
shadings
of
the
thought
that
is
never
completely
expressed
but
he
adds
conceits
may
please
others
to
me
the
chief
concern
seems
to
be
that
we
draw
our
speech
from
the
matter
itself
and
apply
ourselves
less
to
showing
off
our
invention
than
to
present
the
thing
that
is
the
realist
from
this
conception
results
his
admirable
simple
clarity
the
excellent
division
and
presentation
of
his
argument
but
it
also
causes
his
lack
of
depth
and
the
prolixity
by
which
he
is
characterized
his
machine
runs
too
smoothly
in
the
endless
of
his
later
years
ever
new
arguments
occur
to
him
new
passages
to
point
or
quotations
to
support
his
idea
he
praises
laconism
but
never
practises
it
erasmus
never
coins
a
sentence
which
rounded
off
and
pithy
becomes
a
proverb
and
in
this
manner
lives
there
are
no
current
quotations
from
erasmus
the
collector
of
the
has
created
no
new
ones
of
his
own
the
true
occupation
for
a
mind
like
his
was
paraphrasing
in
which
indeed
he
amply
indulged
soothing
down
and
unfolding
was
just
the
work
he
liked
it
is
characteristic
that
he
paraphrased
the
whole
new
testament
except
the
apocalypse
erasmus
mind
was
neither
philosophic
nor
historic
his
was
neither
the
work
of
exact
logical
discrimination
nor
of
grasping
the
deep
sense
of
the
way
of
the
world
in
broad
historical
visions
in
which
the
particulars
themselves
in
their
multiplicity
and
variegation
form
the
image
his
mind
is
philological
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
but
by
that
alone
he
would
not
have
conquered
and
captivated
the
world
his
mind
was
at
the
same
time
of
a
deeply
ethical
and
rather
strong
aesthetic
trend
and
those
three
together
have
made
him
great
the
foundation
of
erasmus
mind
is
his
fervent
desire
of
freedom
clearness
purity
simplicity
and
rest
it
is
an
old
ideal
of
life
to
which
he
gave
new
substance
by
the
wealth
of
his
mind
without
liberty
life
is
no
life
and
there
is
no
liberty
without
repose
the
fact
that
he
never
took
sides
definitely
resulted
from
an
urgent
need
of
perfect
independence
each
engagement
even
a
temporary
one
was
felt
as
a
fetter
by
erasmus
an
interlocutor
in
the
in
which
he
so
often
spontaneously
reveals
his
own
ideals
of
life
declares
himself
determined
neither
to
marry
nor
to
take
holy
orders
nor
to
enter
a
monastery
nor
into
any
connection
from
which
he
will
afterwards
be
unable
to
free
himself
at
least
not
before
he
knows
himself
completely
will
that
be
never
perhaps
no
other
account
do
i
congratulate
myself
more
than
on
the
fact
that
i
have
never
attached
myself
to
any
party
erasmus
says
towards
the
end
of
his
life
liberty
should
be
spiritual
liberty
in
the
first
place
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
things
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
man
is
the
word
of
saint
paul
to
what
purpose
should
he
require
prescriptions
who
of
his
own
accord
does
better
things
than
human
laws
require
what
arrogance
it
is
to
bind
by
institutions
a
man
who
is
clearly
led
by
the
inspirations
of
the
divine
spirit
in
erasmus
we
already
find
the
beginning
of
that
optimism
which
judges
upright
man
good
enough
to
dispense
with
fixed
forms
and
rules
as
more
in
and
rabelais
erasmus
relies
already
on
the
dictates
of
nature
which
produces
man
as
inclined
to
good
and
which
we
may
follow
provided
we
are
imbued
with
faith
and
piety
in
this
line
of
confidence
in
what
is
natural
and
desire
of
the
simple
and
reasonable
erasmus
educational
and
social
ideas
lie
here
he
is
far
ahead
of
his
times
it
would
be
an
attractive
undertaking
to
discuss
erasmus
educational
ideals
more
fully
they
foreshadow
exactly
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
child
should
learn
in
playing
by
means
of
things
that
are
agreeable
to
its
mind
from
pictures
its
faults
should
be
gently
corrected
the
flogging
and
abusive
schoolmaster
is
erasmus
abomination
the
office
itself
is
holy
and
venerable
to
him
education
should
begin
from
the
moment
of
birth
probably
erasmus
attached
too
much
value
to
classicism
here
as
elsewhere
his
friend
peter
gilles
should
implant
the
rudiments
of
the
ancient
languages
in
his
son
that
he
may
greet
his
father
with
endearing
stammerings
in
greek
and
latin
but
what
gentleness
and
clear
good
sense
shines
from
all
erasmus
says
about
instruction
and
education
the
same
holds
good
of
his
views
about
marriage
and
woman
in
the
problem
of
sexual
relations
he
distinctly
sides
with
the
woman
from
deep
conviction
there
is
a
great
deal
of
tenderness
and
delicate
feeling
in
his
conception
of
the
position
of
the
girl
and
the
woman
few
characters
of
the
have
been
drawn
with
so
much
sympathy
as
the
girl
with
the
lover
and
the
cultured
woman
in
the
witty
conversation
with
the
abbot
erasmus
ideal
of
marriage
is
truly
social
and
hygienic
let
us
beget
children
for
the
state
and
for
christ
says
the
lover
children
endowed
by
their
upright
parents
with
a
good
disposition
children
who
see
the
good
example
at
home
which
is
to
guide
them
again
and
again
he
reverts
to
the
mother
duty
to
suckle
the
child
herself
he
indicates
how
the
house
should
be
arranged
in
a
simple
and
cleanly
manner
he
occupies
himself
with
the
problem
of
useful
children
dress
who
stood
up
at
that
time
as
he
did
for
the
fallen
girl
and
for
the
prostitute
compelled
by
necessity
who
saw
so
clearly
the
social
danger
of
marriages
of
persons
infected
with
the
new
scourge
of
europe
so
violently
abhorred
by
erasmus
he
would
wish
that
such
a
marriage
should
at
once
be
declared
null
and
void
by
the
pope
erasmus
does
not
hold
with
the
easy
social
theory
still
quite
current
in
the
literature
of
his
time
which
casts
upon
women
all
the
blame
of
adultery
and
lewdness
with
the
savages
who
live
in
a
state
of
nature
he
says
the
adultery
of
men
is
punished
but
that
of
women
is
forgiven
here
it
appears
at
the
same
time
that
erasmus
knew
be
it
half
in
jest
the
conception
of
natural
virtue
and
happiness
of
naked
islanders
in
a
savage
state
it
soon
crops
up
again
in
montaigne
and
the
following
centuries
develop
it
into
a
literary
dogma

those
are
to
erasmus
the
dominant
requirements
also
when
we
pass
from
his
ethical
and
aesthetic
concepts
to
his
intellectual
point
of
view
indeed
the
two
can
hardly
be
kept
apart
the
world
says
erasmus
is
overloaded
with
human
constitutions
and
opinions
and
scholastic
dogmas
and
overburdened
with
the
tyrannical
authority
of
orders
and
because
of
all
this
the
strength
of
gospel
doctrine
is
flagging
faith
requires
simplification
he
argued
what
would
the
turks
say
of
our
scholasticism
colet
wrote
to
him
one
day
is
no
end
to
books
and
science
let
us
therefore
leave
all
roundabout
roads
and
go
by
a
short
cut
to
the
truth
truth
must
be
simple
language
of
truth
is
simple
says
seneca
well
then
nothing
is
simpler
nor
truer
than
christ
should
wish
erasmus
says
elsewhere
this
simple
and
pure
christ
might
be
deeply
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
men
and
that
i
deem
best
attainable
in
this
way
that
we
supported
by
our
knowledge
of
the
original
languages
should
philosophize
the
themselves
here
a
new
watchword
comes
to
the
fore
back
to
the
sources
it
is
not
merely
an
intellectual
philological
requirement
it
is
equally
an
ethical
and
aesthetic
necessity
of
life
the
original
and
pure
all
that
is
not
yet
overgrown
or
has
not
passed
through
many
hands
has
such
a
potent
charm
erasmus
compared
it
to
an
apple
which
we
ourselves
pick
off
the
tree
to
recall
the
world
to
the
ancient
simplicity
of
science
to
lead
it
back
from
the
now
turbid
pools
to
those
living
and
most
pure
those
most
limpid
sources
of
gospel
doctrine
thus
he
saw
the
task
of
divinity
the
metaphor
of
the
limpid
water
is
not
without
meaning
here
it
reveals
the
psychological
quality
of
fervent
principle
is
it
he
exclaims
people
give
themselves
so
much
trouble
about
the
details
of
all
sorts
of
remote
philosophical
systems
and
neglect
to
go
to
the
sources
of
christianity
itself
this
wisdom
which
is
so
excellent
that
once
for
all
it
put
the
wisdom
of
all
the
world
to
shame
may
be
drawn
from
these
few
books
as
from
a
crystalline
source
with
far
less
trouble
than
is
the
wisdom
of
aristotle
from
so
many
thorny
books
and
with
much
more
fruit
the
equipment
for
that
journey
is
simple
and
at
everyone
immediate
disposal
this
philosophy
is
accessible
to
everybody
christ
desires
that
his
mysteries
shall
be
spread
as
widely
as
possible
i
should
wish
that
all
good
wives
read
the
gospel
and
paul
epistles
that
they
were
translated
into
all
languages
that
out
of
these
the
husbandman
sang
while
ploughing
the
weaver
at
his
loom
that
with
such
stories
the
traveller
should
beguile
his
wayfaring
this
sort
of
philosophy
is
rather
a
matter
of
disposition
than
of
syllogisms
rather
of
life
than
of
disputation
rather
of
inspiration
than
of
erudition
rather
of
transformation
than
of
logic
what
is
the
philosophy
of
christ
which
he
himself
calls
but
the
insaturation
of
nature
created
good
moreover
though
no
one
has
taught
us
this
so
absolutely
and
effectively
as
christ
yet
also
in
pagan
books
much
may
be
found
that
is
in
accordance
with
it
such
was
the
view
of
life
of
this
biblical
humanist
as
often
as
erasmus
reverts
to
these
matters
his
voice
sounds
clearest
no
one
he
says
in
the
preface
to
the
notes
to
the
new
testament
up
this
work
as
he
takes
up
gellius
or
miscellanies
we
are
in
the
presence
of
holy
things
here
it
is
no
question
of
eloquence
these
matters
are
best
recommended
to
the
world
by
simplicity
and
purity
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
display
human
erudition
here
impious
to
pride
oneself
on
human
eloquence
but
erasmus
never
was
so
eloquent
himself
as
just
then
what
here
raises
him
above
his
usual
level
of
force
and
fervour
is
the
fact
that
he
fights
a
battle
the
battle
for
the
right
of
biblical
criticism
it
revolts
him
that
people
should
study
holy
scripture
in
the
vulgate
when
they
know
that
the
texts
show
differences
and
are
corrupt
although
we
have
the
greek
text
by
which
to
go
back
to
the
original
form
and
primary
meaning
he
is
now
reproached
because
he
dares
as
a
mere
grammarian
to
assail
the
text
of
holy
scripture
on
the
score
of
futile
mistakes
or
irregularities
they
are
yes
but
because
of
these
details
we
sometimes
see
even
great
divines
stumble
and
rave
philological
trifling
is
necessary
are
we
so
precise
as
to
our
food
our
clothes
our
and
why
does
this
accuracy
displease
us
in
divine
literature
alone
he
crawls
along
the
ground
they
say
he
wearies
himself
out
about
words
and
syllables
why
do
we
slight
any
word
of
him
whom
we
venerate
and
worship
under
the
name
of
the
word
but
be
it
so
let
whoever
wishes
imagine
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
achieve
anything
better
and
out
of
sluggishness
of
mind
and
coldness
of
heart
or
lack
of
erudition
have
taken
this
lowest
task
upon
myself
it
is
still
a
christian
idea
to
think
all
work
good
that
is
done
with
pious
zeal
we
bring
along
the
bricks
but
to
build
the
temple
of
god
he
does
not
want
to
be
intractable
let
the
vulgate
be
kept
for
use
in
the
liturgy
for
sermons
in
schools
but
he
who
at
home
reads
our
edition
will
understand
his
own
the
better
in
consequence
he
erasmus
is
prepared
to
render
account
and
acknowledge
himself
to
have
been
wrong
when
convicted
of
error
erasmus
perhaps
never
quite
realized
how
much
his
method
must
shake
the
foundations
of
the
church
he
was
surprised
at
his
adversaries
could
not
but
believe
that
all
their
authority
would
perish
at
once
when
the
sacred
books
might
be
read
in
a
purified
form
and
when
people
tried
to
understand
them
in
the
original
he
did
not
feel
what
the
unassailable
authority
of
a
sacred
book
meant
he
rejoices
because
holy
scripture
is
approached
so
much
more
closely
because
all
sorts
of
shadings
are
brought
to
light
by
considering
not
only
what
is
said
but
also
by
whom
for
whom
at
what
time
on
what
occasion
what
precedes
and
what
follows
in
short
by
the
method
of
historical
philological
criticism
to
him
it
seemed
so
especially
pious
when
reading
scripture
and
coming
across
a
place
which
seemed
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
christ
or
the
divinity
of
his
nature
to
believe
rather
that
one
did
not
understand
the
phrase
that
the
text
might
be
unperceived
he
passed
from
emendation
of
the
different
versions
to
the
correction
of
the
contents
the
epistles
were
not
all
written
by
the
apostles
to
whom
they
are
attributed
the
apostles
themselves
made
mistakes
at
times
the
foundation
of
his
spiritual
life
was
no
longer
a
unity
to
erasmus
it
was
on
the
one
hand
a
strong
desire
for
an
upright
simple
pure
and
homely
belief
the
earnest
wish
to
be
a
good
christian
but
it
was
also
the
irresistible
intellectual
and
aesthetic
need
of
the
good
taste
the
harmony
the
clear
and
exact
expression
of
the
ancients
the
dislike
of
what
was
cumbrous
and
involved
erasmus
thought
that
good
learning
might
render
good
service
for
the
necessary
purification
of
the
faith
and
its
forms
the
measure
of
church
hymns
should
be
corrected
that
christian
expression
and
classicism
were
incompatible
he
never
believed
the
man
who
in
the
sphere
of
sacred
studies
asked
every
author
for
his
credentials
remained
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
acknowledged
the
authority
of
the
ancients
without
any
evidence
how
naïvely
he
appeals
to
antiquity
again
and
again
to
justify
some
bold
feat
he
is
critical
they
say
were
not
the
ancients
critical
he
permits
himself
to
insert
digressions
so
did
the
ancients
etc
erasmus
is
in
profound
sympathy
with
that
revered
antiquity
by
his
fundamental
conviction
that
it
is
the
practice
of
life
which
matters
not
he
is
the
great
philosopher
who
knows
the
tenets
of
the
stoics
or
peripatetics
by
rote
but
he
who
expresses
the
meaning
of
philosophy
by
his
life
and
his
morals
for
that
is
its
purpose
he
is
truly
a
divine
who
teaches
not
by
artful
syllogisms
but
by
his
disposition
by
his
face
and
his
eyes
by
his
life
itself
that
wealth
should
be
despised
to
live
up
to
that
standard
is
what
christ
himself
calls
erasmus
uses
the
word
in
the
christian
sense
only
but
in
that
sense
it
is
closely
allied
to
the
idea
of
the
renaissance
as
a
historical
phenomenon
the
worldly
and
pagan
sides
of
the
renaissance
have
nearly
always
been
overrated
erasmus
is
much
more
than
aretino
or
castiglione
the
representative
of
the
spirit
of
his
age
one
over
whose
christian
sentiment
the
sweet
gale
of
antiquity
had
passed
and
that
very
union
of
strong
christian
endeavour
and
the
spirit
of
antiquity
is
the
explanation
of
erasmus
wonderful
success
the
mere
intention
and
the
contents
of
the
mind
do
not
influence
the
world
if
the
form
of
expression
does
not
cooperate
in
erasmus
the
quality
of
his
talent
is
a
very
important
factor
his
perfect
clearness
and
ease
of
expression
his
liveliness
wit
imagination
gusto
and
humour
have
lent
a
charm
to
all
he
wrote
which
to
his
contemporaries
was
irresistible
and
captivates
even
us
as
soon
as
we
read
him
in
all
that
constitutes
his
talent
erasmus
is
perfectly
and
altogether
a
representative
of
the
renaissance
there
is
in
the
first
place
his
eternal
what
he
writes
is
never
vague
never
dark
it
is
always
plausible
everything
seemingly
flows
of
itself
like
a
fountain
it
always
rings
true
as
to
tone
turn
of
phrase
and
accent
it
has
almost
the
light
harmony
of
ariosto
and
it
is
like
ariosto
never
tragic
never
truly
heroic
it
carries
us
away
indeed
but
it
is
never
itself
truly
enraptured
the
more
artistic
aspects
of
erasmus
talent
come
out
most
clearly
though
they
are
everywhere
in
evidence
in
those
two
recreations
after
more
serious
labour
the
and
the
but
just
those
two
have
been
of
enormous
importance
for
his
influence
upon
his
times
for
while
jerome
reached
tens
of
readers
and
the
new
testament
hundreds
the
and
went
out
to
thousands
and
their
importance
is
heightened
in
that
erasmus
has
nowhere
else
expressed
himself
so
spontaneously
in
each
of
the
colloquies
even
in
the
first
purely
formulary
ones
there
is
the
sketch
for
a
comedy
a
novelette
or
a
satire
there
is
hardly
a
sentence
without
its
an
expression
without
a
vivid
fancy
there
are
unrivalled
niceties
the
abbot
of
the
et
eruditae
is
a
molière
character
it
should
be
noticed
how
well
erasmus
always
sustains
his
characters
and
his
scenes
because
he
them
in
woman
in
childbed
he
never
forgets
for
a
moment
that
eutrapelus
is
an
artist
at
the
end
of
game
of
knucklebones
when
the
interlocutors
after
having
elucidated
the
whole
nomenclature
of
the
latin

of

going
to
play
themselves
carolus

we
should
wish
to
possess
the
with
illustrations
by
brueghel
so
closely
allied
is
erasmus
witty
clear
vision
of
incidents
to
that
of
this
great
master
the
procession
of
drunkards
on
palm
sunday
the
saving
of
the
shipwrecked
crew
the
old
men
waiting
for
the
travelling
cart
while
the
drivers
are
still
drinking
all
these
are
dutch
genre
pieces
of
the
best
sort
we
like
to
speak
of
the
realism
of
the
renaissance
erasmus
is
certainly
a
realist
in
the
sense
of
having
an
insatiable
hunger
for
knowledge
of
the
tangible
world
he
wants
to
know
things
and
their
names
the
particulars
of
each
thing
be
it
never
so
remote
such
as
those
terms
of
games
and
rules
of
games
of
the
romans
read
carefully
the
description
of
the
decorative
painting
on
the
of
the
it
is
nothing
but
an
object
lesson
a
graphic
representation
of
the
forms
of
reality
in
its
joy
over
the
material
universe
and
the
supple
pliant
word
the
renaissance
revels
in
a
profusion
of
imagery
and
expressions
the
resounding
enumerations
of
names
and
things
which
rabelais
always
gives
are
not
unknown
to
erasmus
but
he
uses
them
for
intellectual
and
useful
purposes
in
copia
verborum
ac
one
feat
of
varied
power
of
expression
succeeds
another
he
gives
fifty
ways
of
saying
letter
has
given
me
much
pleasure
or
think
that
it
is
going
to
rain
the
aesthetic
impulse
is
here
that
of
a
theme
and
variations
to
display
all
the
wealth
and
mutations
of
the
logic
of
language
elsewhere
too
erasmus
indulges
this
proclivity
for
accumulating
the
treasures
of
his
genius
he
and
his
contemporaries
can
never
restrain
themselves
from
giving
all
the
instances
instead
of
one
in
verae
in
in
in
the
collections
of
and
are
altogether
based
on
this
eagerness
of
the
renaissance
which
by
the
way
was
an
inheritance
of
the
middle
ages
themselves
to
luxuriate
in
the
wealth
of
the
tangible
world
to
revel
in
words
and
things
the
senses
are
open
for
the
nice
observation
of
the
curious
though
erasmus
does
not
know
that
need
of
proving
the
secrets
of
nature
which
inspired
a
leonardo
da
vinci
a
paracelsus
a
vesalius
he
is
also
by
his
keen
observation
a
child
of
his
time
for
peculiarities
in
the
habits
and
customs
of
nations
he
has
an
open
eye
he
notices
the
gait
of
swiss
soldiers
how
dandies
sit
how
picards
pronounce
french
he
notices
that
in
old
pictures
the
sitters
are
always
represented
with
eyes
and
tightly
shut
lips
as
signs
of
modesty
and
how
some
spaniards
still
honour
this
expression
in
life
while
german
art
prefers
lips
pouting
as
for
a
kiss
his
lively
sense
of
anecdote
to
which
he
gives
the
rein
in
all
his
writings
belongs
here
and
in
spite
of
all
his
realism
the
world
which
erasmus
sees
and
renders
is
not
altogether
that
of
the
sixteenth
century
everything
is
veiled
by
latin
between
the
author
mind
and
reality
intervenes
his
antique
diction
at
bottom
the
world
of
his
mind
is
imaginary
it
is
a
subdued
and
limited
reality
which
he
reflects
together
with
its
coarseness
he
lacks
all
that
is
violent
and
direct
in
his
times
compared
with
the
artists
with
luther
and
calvin
with
the
statesmen
the
navigators
the
soldiers
and
the
scientists
erasmus
confronts
the
world
as
a
recluse
it
is
only
the
influence
of
latin
in
spite
of
all
his
receptiveness
and
sensitiveness
erasmus
is
never
fully
in
contact
with
life
all
through
his
work
not
a
bird
sings
not
a
wind
rustles
but
that
reserve
or
fear
of
directness
is
not
merely
a
negative
quality
it
also
results
from
a
consciousness
of
the
indefiniteness
of
the
ground
of
all
things
from
the
awe
of
the
ambiguity
of
all
that
is
if
erasmus
so
often
hovers
over
the
borderline
between
earnestness
and
mockery
if
he
hardly
ever
gives
an
incisive
conclusion
it
is
not
only
due
to
cautiousness
and
fear
to
commit
himself
everywhere
he
sees
the
shadings
the
blending
of
the
meaning
of
words
the
terms
of
things
are
no
longer
to
him
as
to
the
man
of
the
middle
ages
as
crystals
mounted
in
gold
or
as
stars
in
the
firmament
like
assertions
so
little
that
i
would
easily
take
sides
with
the
sceptics
whereever
it
is
allowed
by
the
inviolable
authority
of
holy
scripture
and
the
decrees
of
the
church
is
exempt
from
error
all
subtle
contentions
of
theological
speculation
arise
from
a
dangerous
curiosity
and
lead
to
impious
audacity
what
have
all
the
great
controversies
about
the
trinity
and
the
virgin
mary
profited
have
defined
so
much
that
without
danger
to
our
salvation
might
have
remained
unknown
or
undecided
the
essentials
of
our
religion
are
peace
and
unanimity
these
can
hardly
exist
unless
we
make
definitions
about
as
few
points
as
possible
and
leave
many
questions
to
individual
judgement
numerous
problems
are
now
postponed
till
the
oecumenical
council
it
would
be
much
better
to
put
off
such
questions
till
the
time
when
the
glass
shall
be
removed
and
the
darkness
cleared
away
and
we
shall
see
god
face
to
face
are
sanctuaries
in
the
sacred
studies
which
god
has
not
willed
that
we
should
probe
and
if
we
try
to
penetrate
there
we
grope
in
ever
deeper
darkness
the
farther
we
proceed
so
that
we
recognize
in
this
manner
too
the
inscrutable
majesty
of
divine
wisdom
and
the
imbecility
of
human
understanding

met
with

response
in
the
heart
of
his
contemporaries
and
had
a
lasting
influence
on
the
march
of
civilization
but
one
of
the
heroes
of
history
he
can
not
be
called
was
not
his
failure
to
attain
to
still
loftier
heights
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
his
character
was
not
on
a
level
with
the
elevation
of
his
mind
and
yet
that
character
a
very
complicated
one
though
he
took
himself
to
be
the
simplest
man
in
the
world
was
determined
by
the
same
factors
which
determined
the
structure
of
his
mind
again
and
again
we
find
in
his
inclinations
the
correlates
of
his
convictions
at
the
root
of
his
moral
being
we
find
a
key
to
the
understanding
of
his
character
that
same
profound
need
of
purity
which
drove
him
to
the
sources
of
sacred
science
purity
in
the
material
and
the
moral
sense
is
what
he
desires
for
himself
and
others
always
and
in
all
things
few
things
revolt
him
so
much
as
the
practices
of
vintners
who
doctor
wine
and
dealers
who
adulterate
food
if
he
continually
chastens
his
language
and
style
or
exculpates
himself
from
mistakes
it
is
the
same
impulse
which
prompts
his
passionate
desire
for
cleanliness
and
brightness
of
the
home
and
of
the
body
he
has
a
violent
dislike
of
stuffy
air
and
smelly
substances
he
regularly
takes
a
roundabout
way
to
avoid
a
malodorous
lane
he
loathes
shambles
and
fishmongers
shops
fetors
spread
infection
he
thinks
erasmus
had
earlier
than
most
people
antiseptic
ideas
about
the
danger
of
infection
in
the
foul
air
of
crowded
inns
in
the
breath
of
confessants
in
baptismal
water
throw
aside
common
cups
he
pleaded
let
everybody
shave
himself
let
us
be
cleanly
as
to
let
us
not
kiss
each
other
by
way
of
greeting
the
fear
of
the
horrible
venereal
disease
imported
into
europe
during
his
lifetime
and
of
which
erasmus
watched
the
unbridled
propagation
with
solicitude
increases
his
desire
for
purity
too
little
is
being
done
to
stop
it
he
thinks
he
cautions
against
suspected
inns
he
wants
to
have
measures
taken
against
the
marriages
of
syphilitic
persons
in
his
undignified
attitude
towards
hutten
his
physical
and
moral
aversion
to
the
man
evil
plays
an
unmistakable
part
erasmus
is
a
delicate
soul
in
all
his
fibres
his
body
forces
him
to
be
that
he
is
highly
sensitive
among
other
things
very
susceptible
to
cold
scholars
disorder
as
he
calls
it
early
in
life
already
the
painful
malady
of
the
stone
begins
to
torment
him
which
he
resisted
so
bravely
when
his
work
was
at
stake
he
always
speaks
in
a
coddling
tone
about
his
little
body
which
can
not
stand
fasting
which
must
be
kept
fit
by
some
exercise
namely
riding
and
for
which
he
carefully
tries
to
select
a
suitable
climate
he
is
at
times
circumstantial
in
the
description
of
his
ailments
he
has
to
be
very
careful
in
the
matter
of
his
sleep
if
once
he
wakes
up
he
finds
it
difficult
to
go
to
sleep
again
and
because
of
that
has
often
to
lose
the
morning
the
best
time
to
work
and
which
is
so
dear
to
him
he
can
not
stand
cold
wind
and
fog
but
still
less
overheated
rooms
how
he
has
execrated
the
german
stoves
which
are
burned
nearly
all
the
year
through
and
made
germany
almost
unbearable
to
him
of
his
fear
of
illness
we
have
spoken
above
it
is
not
only
the
plague
which
he
flees
for
fear
of
catching
cold
he
gives
up
a
journey
from
louvain
to
antwerp
where
his
friend
peter
gilles
is
in
mourning
although
he
realizes
quite
well
that
a
great
deal
of
the
disease
is
in
the
imagination
yet
his
own
imagination
leaves
him
no
peace
nevertheless
when
he
is
seriously
ill
he
does
not
fear
death
his
hygienics
amount
to
temperance
cleanliness
and
fresh
air
this
last
item
in
moderation
he
takes
the
vicinity
of
the
sea
to
be
unwholesome
and
is
afraid
of
draughts
his
friend
gilles
who
is
ill
he
advises
not
take
too
much
medicine
keep
quiet
and
do
not
get
angry
though
there
is
a
of
medicine
among
his
works
he
does
not
think
highly
of
physicians
and
satirizes
them
more
than
once
in
the
also
in
his
outward
appearance
there
were
certain
features
betraying
his
delicacy
he
was
of
medium
height
of
a
fair
complexion
with
blond
hair
and
blue
eyes
a
cheerful
face
a
very
articulate
mode
of
speech
but
a
thin
voice
in
the
moral
sphere
erasmus
delicacy
is
represented
by
his
great
need
of
friendship
and
concord
his
dislike
of
contention
with
him
peace
and
harmony
rank
above
all
other
considerations
and
he
confesses
them
to
be
the
guiding
principles
of
his
actions
he
would
if
it
might
be
have
all
the
world
as
a
friend
i
discharge
no
one
from
my
friendship
he
says
and
though
he
was
sometimes
capricious
and
exacting
towards
his
friends
yet
a
truly
great
friend
he
was
witness
the
many
who
never
forsook
him
or
whom
he
after
a
temporary
estrangement
always
won
back
more
peter
gilles
fisher
ammonius
budaeus
and
others
too
numerous
to
mention
was
most
constant
in
keeping
up
friendships
says
beatus
rhenanus
whose
own
attachment
to
erasmus
is
a
proof
of
the
strong
affection
he
could
inspire
at
the
root
of
this
desire
of
friendship
lies
a
great
and
sincere
need
of
affection
remember
the
effusions
of
almost
feminine
affection
towards
servatius
during
his
monastic
period
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
sort
of
moral
serenity
that
makes
him
so
an
aversion
to
disturbance
to
whatever
is
harsh
and
inharmonious
he
calls
it
certain
occult
natural
sense
which
makes
him
abhor
strife
he
can
not
abide
being
at
loggerheads
with
anyone
he
always
hoped
and
wanted
he
says
to
keep
his
pen
unbloody
to
attack
no
one
to
provoke
no
one
even
if
he
were
attacked
but
his
enemies
had
not
willed
it
and
in
later
years
he
became
well
accustomed
to
bitter
polemics
with
lefèvre
with
lee
with
egmondanus
with
hutten
with
luther
with
beda
with
the
spaniards
and
the
italians
at
first
it
is
still
noticeable
how
he
suffers
by
it
how
contention
wounds
him
so
that
he
can
not
bear
the
pain
in
silence
let
us
be
friends
again
he
begs
lefèvre
who
does
not
reply
the
time
which
he
had
to
devote
to
his
polemics
he
regards
as
lost
feel
myself
getting
more
heavy
every
day
he
writes
in
so
much
on
account
of
my
age
as
because
of
the
restless
labour
of
my
studies
nay
more
even
by
the
weariness
of
disputes
than
by
the
work
which
in
itself
is
agreeable
and
how
much
strife
was
still
in
store
for
him
then
if
only
erasmus
had
been
less
concerned
about
public
opinion
but
that
seemed
impossible
he
had
a
fear
of
men
or
we
may
call
it
a
fervent
need
of
justification
he
would
always
see
beforehand
and
usually
in
exaggerated
colours
the
effect
his
word
or
deed
would
have
upon
men
of
himself
it
was
certainly
true
as
he
once
wrote
that
the
craving
for
fame
has
less
sharp
spurs
than
the
fear
of
ignominy
erasmus
is
with
rousseau
among
those
who
can
not
bear
the
consciousness
of
guilt
out
of
a
sort
of
mental
cleanliness
not
to
be
able
to
repay
a
benefit
with
interest
makes
him
ashamed
and
sad
he
can
not
abide
creditors
unperformed
duty
neglect
of
the
need
of
a
friend
if
he
can
not
discharge
the
obligation
he
explains
it
away
the
dutch
historian
fruin
has
quite
correctly
observed
erasmus
did
contrary
to
his
duty
and
his
rightly
understood
interests
was
the
fault
of
circumstances
or
wrong
advice
he
is
never
to
blame
himself
and
what
he
has
thus
justified
for
himself
becomes
with
him
universal
law
relieves
people
of
pernicious
vows
if
only
they
repent
of
them
says
the
man
who
himself
had
broken
a
vow
there
is
in
erasmus
a
dangerous
fusion
between
inclination
and
conviction
the
correlations
between
his
idiosyncrasies
and
his
precepts
are
undeniable
this
has
special
reference
to
his
point
of
view
in
the
matter
of
fasting
and
abstinence
from
meat
he
too
frequently
vents
his
own
aversion
to
fish
or
talks
of
his
inability
to
postpone
meals
not
to
make
this
connection
clear
to
everybody
in
the
same
way
his
personal
experience
in
the
monastery
passes
into
his
disapproval
on
principle
of
monastic
life
the
distortion
of
the
image
of
his
youth
in
his
memory
to
which
we
have
referred
is
based
on
that
need
of
it
is
all
unconscious
interpretation
of
the
undeniable
facts
to
suit
the
ideal
which
erasmus
had
made
of
himself
and
to
which
he
honestly
thinks
he
answers
the
chief
features
of
that
picture
are
a
remarkable
simple
sincerity
and
frankness
which
make
it
impossible
to
him
to
dissemble
inexperience
and
carelessness
in
the
ordinary
concerns
of
life
and
a
total
lack
of
ambition
all
this
is
true
in
the
first
instance
there
is
a
superficial
erasmus
who
answers
to
that
image
but
it
is
not
the
whole
erasmus
there
is
a
deeper
one
who
is
almost
the
opposite
and
whom
he
himself
does
not
know
because
he
will
not
know
him
possibly
because
behind
this
there
is
a
still
deeper
being
which
is
truly
good
does
he
not
ascribe
weaknesses
to
himself
certainly
he
is
in
spite
of
his
ever
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
his
work
he
calls
himself
meaning
the
quality
of
never
being
content
with
himself
it
is
that
peculiarity
which
makes
him
dissatisfied
with
any
work
of
his
directly
after
it
has
appeared
so
that
he
always
keeps
revising
and
supplementing
he
calls
himself
in
writing
to
colet
but
again
he
can
not
help
giving
himself
credit
for
acknowledging
that
quality
nay
converting
that
quality
itself
into
a
virtue
it
is
modesty
the
opposite
of
boasting
and
this
bashfulness
about
himself
is
the
reason
that
he
does
not
love
his
own
physiognomy
and
is
only
persuaded
with
difficulty
by
his
friends
to
sit
for
a
portrait
his
own
appearance
is
not
heroic
or
dignified
enough
for
him
and
he
is
not
duped
by
an
artist
who
flatters
him
he
exclaims
on
seeing
holbein
thumbnail
sketch
illustrating
the
erasmus
still
looked
like
that
he
would
take
a
wife
at
once
it
is
that
deep
trait
of
dissatisfaction
that
suggests
the
inscription
on
his
portraits
writings
will
show
you
a
better
image
erasmus
modesty
and
the
contempt
which
he
displays
of
the
fame
that
fell
to
his
lot
are
of
a
somewhat
rhetorical
character
but
in
this
we
should
not
so
much
see
a
personal
trait
of
erasmus
as
a
general
form
common
to
all
humanists
on
the
other
hand
this
mood
can
not
be
called
altogether
artificial
his
books
which
he
calls
his
children
have
not
turned
out
well
he
does
not
think
they
will
live
he
does
not
set
store
by
his
letters
he
publishes
them
because
his
friends
insist
upon
it
he
writes
his
poems
to
try
a
new
pen
he
hopes
that
geniuses
will
soon
appear
who
will
eclipse
him
so
that
erasmus
will
pass
for
a
stammerer
what
is
fame
a
pagan
survival
he
is
fed
up
with
it
to
repletion
and
would
do
nothing
more
gladly
than
cast
it
off
sometimes
another
note
escapes
him
if
lee
would
help
him
in
his
endeavours
erasmus
would
make
him
immortal
he
had
told
the
former
in
their
first
conversation
and
he
threatens
an
unknown
adversary
you
go
on
so
impudently
to
assail
my
good
name
then
take
care
that
my
gentleness
does
not
give
way
and
i
cause
you
to
be
ranked
after
a
thousand
years
among
the
venomous
sycophants
among
the
idle
boasters
among
the
incompetent
physicians
the
element
in
erasmus
must
needs
increase
accordingly
as
he
in
truth
became
a
centre
and
objective
point
of
ideas
and
culture
there
really
was
a
time
when
it
must
seem
to
him
that
the
world
hinged
upon
him
and
that
it
awaited
the
redeeming
word
from
him
what
a
widespread
enthusiastic
following
he
had
how
many
warm
friends
and
venerators
there
is
something
naïve
in
the
way
in
which
he
thinks
it
requisite
to
treat
all
his
friends
in
an
open
letter
to
a
detailed
rather
repellent
account
of
an
illness
that
attacked
him
on
the
way
back
from
basle
to
louvain
part
position
name
this
more
and
more
becomes
the
aspect
under
which
he
sees
years
will
come
in
which
his
whole
enormous
correspondence
is
little
more
than
one
protracted
yet
this
man
who
has
so
many
friends
is
nevertheless
solitary
at
heart
and
in
the
depth
of
that
heart
he
desires
to
be
alone
he
is
of
a
most
retiring
disposition
he
is
have
always
wished
to
be
alone
and
there
is
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
sworn
partisans
erasmus
is
one
of
those
whom
contact
with
others
weakens
the
less
he
has
to
address
and
to
consider
others
friends
or
enemies
the
more
truly
he
utters
his
deepest
soul
intercourse
with
particular
people
always
causes
little
scruples
in
him
intentional
amenities
coquetry
reticences
reserves
spiteful
hits
evasions
therefore
it
should
not
be
thought
that
we
get
to
know
him
to
the
core
from
his
letters
natures
like
his
which
all
contact
with
men
unsettles
give
their
best
and
deepest
when
they
speak
impersonally
and
to
all
after
the
early
effusions
of
sentimental
affection
he
no
longer
opens
his
heart
unreservedly
to
others
at
bottom
he
feels
separated
from
all
and
on
the
alert
towards
all
there
is
a
great
fear
in
him
that
others
will
touch
his
soul
or
disturb
the
image
he
has
made
of
himself
the
attitude
of
warding
off
reveals
itself
as
fastidiousness
and
as
bashfulness
budaeus
hit
the
mark
when
he
exclaimed
jocularly
you
little
fastidious
person
erasmus
himself
interprets
the
dominating
trait
of
his
being
as
maidenly
coyness
the
excessive
sensitiveness
to
the
stain
attaching
to
his
birth
results
from
it
but
his
friend
ammonius
speaks
of
his
his
somewhat
rustic
there
is
indeed
often
something
of
the
small
man
about
erasmus
who
is
hampered
by
greatness
and
therefore
shuns
the
great
because
at
bottom
they
obsess
him
and
he
feels
them
to
be
inimical
to
his
being
it
seems
a
hard
thing
to
say
that
genuine
loyalty
and
fervent
gratefulness
were
strange
to
erasmus
and
yet
such
was
his
nature
in
characters
like
his
a
kind
of
mental
cramp
keeps
back
the
effusions
of
the
heart
he
subscribes
to
the
adage
so
as
if
you
may
hate
one
day
and
hate
so
as
if
you
may
love
one
day
he
can
not
bear
benefits
in
his
inmost
soul
he
continually
retires
before
everybody
he
who
considers
himself
the
pattern
of
simple
unsuspicion
is
indeed
in
the
highest
degree
suspicious
towards
all
his
friends
the
dead
ammonius
who
had
helped
him
so
zealously
in
the
most
delicate
concerns
is
not
secure
from
it
are
always
unfairly
distrustful
towards
me
budaeus
complains
exclaims
erasmus
will
find
few
people
who
are
so
little
distrustful
in
friendship
as
myself
when
at
the
height
of
his
fame
the
attention
of
the
world
was
indeed
fixed
on
all
he
spoke
or
did
there
was
some
ground
for
a
certain
feeling
on
his
part
of
being
always
watched
and
threatened
but
when
he
was
yet
an
unknown
man
of
letters
in
his
parisian
years
we
continually
find
traces
in
him
of
a
mistrust
of
the
people
about
him
that
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
morbid
feeling
during
the
last
period
of
his
life
this
feeling
attaches
especially
to
two
enemies
eppendorf
and
aleander
eppendorf
employs
spies
everywhere
who
watch
erasmus
correspondence
with
his
friends
aleander
continually
sets
people
to
combat
him
and
lies
in
wait
for
him
wherever
he
can
his
interpretation
of
the
intentions
of
his
assailants
has
the
ingenious
element
which
passes
the
borderline
of
sanity
he
sees
the
whole
world
full
of
calumny
and
ambuscades
threatening
his
peace
nearly
all
those
who
once
were
his
best
friends
have
become
his
bitterest
enemies
they
wag
their
venomous
tongues
at
banquets
in
conversation
in
the
confessional
in
sermons
in
lectures
at
court
in
vehicles
and
ships
the
minor
enemies
like
troublesome
vermin
drive
him
to
weariness
of
life
or
to
death
by
insomnia
he
compares
his
tortures
to
the
martyrdom
of
saint
sebastian
pierced
by
arrows
but
his
is
worse
for
there
is
no
end
to
it
for
years
he
has
daily
been
dying
a
thousand
deaths
and
that
alone
for
his
friends
if
such
there
are
are
deterred
by
envy
he
mercilessly
pillories
his
patrons
in
a
row
for
their
stinginess
now
and
again
there
suddenly
comes
to
light
an
undercurrent
of
aversion
and
hatred
which
we
did
not
suspect
where
had
more
good
things
fallen
to
his
lot
than
in
england
which
country
had
he
always
praised
more
but
suddenly
a
bitter
and
unfounded
reproach
escapes
him
england
is
responsible
for
his
having
become
faithless
to
his
monastic
vows
no
other
reason
do
i
hate
britain
more
than
for
this
though
it
has
always
been
pestilent
to
me
he
seldom
allows
himself
to
go
so
far
his
expressions
of
hatred
or
spite
are
as
a
rule
restricted
to
the
feline
they
are
aimed
at
friends
and
enemies
budaeus
lypsius
as
well
as
hutten
and
beda
occasionally
we
are
struck
by
the
expression
of
coarse
pleasure
at
another
misfortune
but
in
all
this
as
regards
malice
we
should
not
measure
erasmus
by
our
ideas
of
delicacy
and
gentleness
compared
with
most
of
his
contemporaries
he
remains
moderate
and
refined
erasmus
never
felt
happy
was
never
content
this
may
perhaps
surprise
us
for
a
moment
when
we
think
of
his
cheerful
energy
of
his
gay
jests
and
his
humour
but
upon
reflection
this
unhappy
feeling
tallies
very
well
with
his
character
it
also
proceeds
from
his
general
attitude
of
warding
off
even
when
in
high
spirits
he
considers
himself
in
all
respects
an
unhappy
man
most
miserable
of
all
men
the
erasmus
he
calls
himself
in
fine
greek
terms
his
life
an
iliad
of
calamities
a
chain
of
misfortunes
how
can
anyone
envy
to
no
one
has
fortune
been
so
constantly
hostile
as
to
him
she
has
sworn
his
destruction
thus
he
sang
in
his
youth
in
a
poetical
complaint
addressed
to
gaguin
from
earliest
infancy
the
same
sad
and
hard
fate
has
been
constantly
pursuing
him
pandora
whole
box
seems
to
have
been
poured
out
over
him
this
unhappy
feeling
takes
the
special
form
of
his
having
been
charged
by
unlucky
stars
with
herculean
labour
without
profit
or
pleasure
to
himself
troubles
and
vexations
without
end
his
life
might
have
been
so
much
easier
if
he
had
taken
his
chances
he
should
never
have
left
italy
or
he
ought
to
have
stayed
in
england
an
immoderate
love
of
liberty
caused
me
to
wrestle
long
with
faithless
friends
and
inveterate
poverty
elsewhere
he
says
more
resignedly
we
are
driven
by
fate
that
immoderate
love
of
liberty
had
indeed
been
as
fate
to
him
he
had
always
been
the
great
seeker
of
quiet
and
liberty
who
found
liberty
late
and
quiet
never
by
no
means
ever
to
bind
himself
to
incur
no
obligations
which
might
become
fetters
again
that
fear
of
the
entanglements
of
life
thus
he
remained
the
great
restless
one
he
was
never
truly
satisfied
with
anything
least
of
all
with
what
he
produced
himself
then
do
you
overwhelm
us
with
so
many
books
someone
at
louvain
objected
you
do
not
really
approve
of
any
of
them
and
erasmus
answers
with
horace
word
the
first
place
because
i
can
not
sleep
a
sleepless
energy
it
was
that
indeed
he
can
not
rest
still
half
seasick
and
occupied
with
his
trunks
he
is
already
thinking
about
an
answer
to
dorp
letter
just
received
censuring
the
we
should
fully
realize
what
it
means
that
time
after
time
erasmus
who
by
nature
loved
quiet
and
was
fearful
and
fond
of
comfort
cleanliness
and
good
fare
undertakes
troublesome
and
dangerous
journeys
even
voyages
which
he
detests
for
the
sake
of
his
work
and
of
that
alone
he
is
not
only
restless
but
also
precipitate
helped
by
an
incomparably
retentive
and
capacious
memory
he
writes
at
haphazard
he
never
becomes
anacoluthic
his
talent
is
too
refined
and
sure
for
that
but
he
does
repeat
himself
and
is
unnecessarily
circumstantial
rather
pour
out
than
write
everything
he
says
he
compares
his
publications
to
parturitions
nay
to
abortions
he
does
not
select
his
subjects
he
tumbles
into
them
and
having
once
taken
up
a
subject
he
finishes
without
intermission
for
years
he
has
read
only
up
and
down
all
literature
he
no
longer
finds
time
really
to
refresh
his
mind
by
reading
and
to
work
so
as
to
please
himself
on
that
account
he
envied
budaeus
not
publish
too
hastily
more
warns
him
are
watched
to
be
caught
in
inexactitudes
erasmus
knows
it
he
will
correct
all
later
he
will
ever
have
to
revise
and
to
polish
everything
he
hates
the
labour
of
revising
and
correcting
but
he
submits
to
it
and
works
passionately
the
treadmill
of
basle
and
he
says
finishes
the
work
of
six
years
in
eight
months
in
that
recklessness
and
precipitation
with
which
erasmus
labours
there
is
again
one
of
the
unsolved
contradictions
of
his
being
he
precipitate
and
careless
he
to
be
careful
and
cautious
his
mind
drives
him
to
be
the
first
his
nature
restrains
him
but
usually
only
after
the
word
has
been
written
and
published
the
result
is
a
continual
intermingling
of
explosion
and
reserve
the
way
in
which
erasmus
always
tries
to
shirk
definite
statements
irritates
us
how
carefully
he
always
tries
to
represent
the
in
which
he
had
spontaneously
revealed
so
much
of
his
inner
convictions
as
mere
trifling
committed
to
paper
to
please
his
friends
they
are
only
meant
to
teach
correct
latin
and
if
anything
is
said
in
them
touching
matters
of
faith
it
is
not
i
who
say
it
is
it
as
often
as
he
censures
classes
or
offices
in
the
princes
above
all
he
warns
the
readers
not
to
regard
his
words
as
aimed
at
particular
persons
erasmus
was
a
master
of
reserve
he
knew
even
when
he
held
definite
views
how
to
avoid
direct
decisions
not
only
from
caution
but
also
because
he
saw
the
eternal
ambiguity
of

erasmus
ascribes
to
himself
an
unusual
horror
of
lies
on
seeing
a
liar
he
says
he
was
corporeally
affected
as
a
boy
he
already
violently
disliked
mendacious
boys
such
as
the
little
braggart
of
whom
he
tells
in
the
that
this
reaction
of
aversion
is
genuine
is
not
contradicted
by
the
fact
that
we
catch
erasmus
himself
in
untruths
inconsistencies
flattery
pieces
of
cunning
white
lies
serious
suppression
of
facts
simulated
sentiments
of
respect
or
sorrow
they
may
all
be
pointed
out
in
his
letters
he
once
disavowed
his
deepest
conviction
for
a
gratuity
from
anne
of
borselen
by
flattering
her
bigotry
he
requested
his
best
friend
batt
to
tell
lies
in
his
behalf
he
most
sedulously
denied
his
authorship
of
the
julius
dialogue
for
fear
of
the
consequences
even
to
more
and
always
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
saying
outright
did
not
write
it
those
who
know
other
humanists
and
know
how
frequently
and
impudently
they
lied
will
perhaps
think
more
lightly
of
erasmus
sins
for
the
rest
even
during
his
lifetime
he
did
not
escape
punishment
for
his
eternal
reserve
his
proficiency
in
and
veiled
truths
insinuations
and
slanderous
allusions
the
accusation
of
perfidy
was
often
cast
in
his
teeth
sometimes
in
serious
indignation
are
always
engaged
in
bringing
suspicion
upon
others
edward
lee
exclaims
dare
you
usurp
the
office
of
a
general
censor
and
condemn
what
you
have
hardly
ever
tasted
how
dare
you
despise
all
but
yourself
falsely
and
insultingly
do
you
expose
your
antagonist
in
the
lee
quotes
the
spiteful
passage
referring
to
himself
and
then
exclaims
from
these
words
the
world
may
come
to
know
its
divine
its
censor
its
modest
and
sincere
author
that
erasmian
diffidence
earnest
decency
and
honesty
erasmian
modesty
has
long
been
proverbial
you
are
always
using
the
words
false
accusations
you
say
if
i
was
consciously
guilty
of
the
smallest
of
all
his
lee
false
accusations
i
should
not
dare
to
approach
the
lord
table
o
man
who
are
you
to
judge
another
a
servant
who
stands
or
falls
before
his
lord
this
was
the
first
violent
attack
from
the
conservative
side
in
the
beginning
of
when
the
mighty
struggle
which
luther
action
had
unchained
kept
the
world
in
ever
greater
suspense
six
months
later
followed
the
first
serious
reproaches
on
the
part
of
radical
reformers
ulrich
von
hutten
the
impetuous
somewhat
knight
who
wanted
to
see
luther
cause
triumph
as
the
national
cause
of
germany
turns
to
erasmus
whom
at
one
time
he
had
enthusiastically
acclaimed
as
the
man
of
the
new
weal
with
the
urgent
appeal
not
to
forsake
the
cause
of
the
reformation
or
to
compromise
it
have
shown
yourself
fearful
in
the
affair
of
reuchlin
now
in
that
of
luther
you
do
your
utmost
to
convince
his
adversaries
that
you
are
altogether
averse
from
it
though
we
know
better
do
not
disown
us
you
know
how
triumphantly
certain
letters
of
yours
are
circulated
in
which
to
protect
yourself
from
suspicion
you
rather
meanly
fasten
it
on
others
if
you
are
now
afraid
to
incur
a
little
hostility
for
sake
concede
me
at
least
that
you
will
not
allow
yourself
out
of
fear
for
another
to
be
tempted
to
renounce
me
rather
be
silent
about
me
those
were
bitter
reproaches
in
the
man
who
had
to
swallow
them
there
was
a
puny
erasmus
who
deserved
those
reproaches
who
took
offence
at
them
but
did
not
take
them
to
heart
who
continued
to
act
with
prudent
reserve
till
hutten
friendship
was
turned
to
hatred
in
him
was
also
a
great
erasmus
who
knew
how
under
the
passion
and
infatuation
with
which
the
parties
combated
each
other
the
truth
he
sought
and
the
love
he
hoped
would
subdue
the
world
were
obscured
who
knew
the
god
whom
he
professed
too
high
to
take
sides
let
us
try
ever
to
see
of
that
great
erasmus
as
much
as
the
petty
one
permits

erasmus

the
opposition
of
conservative
theology
merely
as
a
conspiracy
against
good
learning
when
erasmus
established
himself
at
louvain
in
the
summer
of
he
had
a
vague
presentiment
that
great
changes
were
at
hand
fear
he
writes
in
september
a
great
subversion
of
affairs
is
being
brought
about
here
if
god
favour
and
the
piety
and
wisdom
of
princes
do
not
concern
themselves
about
human
matters
but
the
forms
which
that
great
change
would
assume
he
did
not
in
the
least
realize
he
regarded
his
removal
as
merely
temporary
it
was
only
to
last
we
shall
have
seen
which
place
of
residence
is
best
fit
for
old
age
which
is
already
knocking
there
is
something
pathetic
in
the
man
who
desires
nothing
but
quiet
and
liberty
and
who
through
his
own
restlessness
and
his
inability
not
to
concern
himself
about
other
people
never
found
a
really
fixed
abode
or
true
independence
erasmus
is
one
of
those
people
who
always
seem
to
say
tomorrow
tomorrow
i
must
first
deal
with
this
and
then
as
soon
as
he
shall
be
ready
with
the
new
edition
of
the
new
testament
and
shall
have
extricated
himself
from
troublesome
and
disagreeable
theological
controversies
in
which
he
finds
himself
entangled
against
his
wish
he
will
sleep
hide
himself
for
himself
and
the
muses
but
that
time
never
came
where
to
live
when
he
shall
be
free
spain
to
which
cardinal
ximenes
called
him
did
not
appeal
to
him
from
germany
he
says
the
stoves
and
the
insecurity
deter
him
in
england
the
servitude
which
was
required
of
him
there
revolted
him
but
in
the
netherlands
themselves
he
did
not
feel
at
his
ease
either
i
am
barked
at
a
great
deal
and
there
is
no
remuneration
though
i
desired
it
ever
so
much
i
could
not
bear
to
stay
there
long
yet
he
remained
for
four
years
erasmus
had
good
friends
in
the
university
of
louvain
at
first
he
put
up
with
his
old
host
johannes
paludanus
rhetor
of
the
university
whose
house
he
exchanged
that
summer
for
quarters
in
the
college
of
the
lily
martin
dorp
a
dutchman
like
himself
had
not
been
estranged
from
him
by
their
polemics
about
the
his
good
will
was
of
great
importance
to
erasmus
because
of
the
important
place
dorp
occupied
in
the
theological
faculty
and
lastly
though
his
old
patron
adrian
of
utrecht
afterwards
pope
had
by
that
time
been
called
away
from
louvain
to
higher
dignities
his
influence
had
not
diminished
in
consequence
but
rather
increased
for
just
about
that
time
he
had
been
made
a
cardinal
erasmus
was
received
with
great
complaisance
by
the
louvain
divines
their
leader
the
of
the
university
jean
briard
of
ath
repeatedly
expressed
his
approval
of
the
edition
of
the
new
testament
to
erasmus
great
satisfaction
soon
erasmus
found
himself
a
member
of
the
theological
faculty
yet
he
did
not
feel
at
his
ease
among
the
louvain
theologians
the
atmosphere
was
a
great
deal
less
congenial
to
him
than
that
of
the
world
of
the
english
scholars
here
he
felt
a
spirit
which
he
did
not
understand
and
distrusted
in
consequence
in
the
years
in
which
the
reformation
began
erasmus
was
the
victim
of
a
great
misunderstanding
the
result
of
the
fact
that
his
delicate
aesthetic
hovering
spirit
understood
neither
the
profoundest
depths
of
the
faith
nor
the
hard
necessities
of
human
society
he
was
neither
mystic
nor
realist
luther
was
both
to
erasmus
the
great
problem
of
church
and
state
and
society
seemed
simple
nothing
was
required
but
restoration
and
purification
by
a
return
to
the
original
unspoilt
sources
of
christianity
a
number
of
accretions
to
the
faith
rather
ridiculous
than
revolting
had
to
be
cleared
away
all
should
be
reduced
to
the
nucleus
of
faith
christ
and
the
gospel
forms
ceremonies
speculations
should
make
room
for
the
practice
of
true
piety
the
gospel
was
easily
intelligible
to
everybody
and
within
everybody
reach
and
the
means
to
reach
all
this
was
good
learning
had
he
not
himself
by
his
editions
of
the
new
testament
and
of
jerome
and
even
earlier
by
the
now
famous
done
most
of
what
had
to
be
done
hope
that
what
now
pleases
the
upright
will
soon
please
all
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
erasmus
had
written
to
wolfgang
fabricius
capito
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
accomplished
the
great
task
then
take
you
the
torch
from
us
the
work
will
henceforth
be
a
great
deal
easier
and
cause
far
less
hatred
and
envy
have
lived
through
the
first
shock
budaeus
writes
to
tunstall
in
may
anyone
born
under
such
inauspicious
graces
that
the
dull
and
obscure
discipline
scholasticism
does
not
revolt
him
since
sacred
literature
too
cleansed
by
diligence
has
regained
its
ancient
purity
and
brightness
but
it
is
still
much
greater
that
he
should
have
effected
by
the
same
labour
the
emergence
of
sacred
truth
itself
out
of
that
cimmerian
darkness
even
though
divinity
is
not
yet
quite
free
from
the
dirt
of
the
sophist
school
if
that
should
occur
one
day
it
will
be
owing
to
the
beginnings
made
in
our
times
the
philologist
budaeus
believed
even
more
firmly
than
erasmus
that
faith
was
a
matter
of
erudition
it
could
not
but
vex
erasmus
that
not
everyone
accepted
the
cleansed
truth
at
once
how
could
people
continue
to
oppose
themselves
to
what
to
him
seemed
as
clear
as
daylight
and
so
simple
he
who
so
sincerely
would
have
liked
to
live
in
peace
with
all
the
world
found
himself
involved
in
a
series
of
polemics
to
let
the
opposition
of
opponents
pass
unnoticed
was
forbidden
not
only
by
his
character
for
ever
striving
to
justify
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
also
by
the
custom
of
his
time
so
eager
for
dispute
there
were
first
of
all
his
polemics
with
jacques
lefèvre
or
in
latinized
form
faber
stapulensis
the
parisian
theologian
who
as
a
preparer
of
the
reformation
may
more
than
anyone
else
be
ranked
with
erasmus
at
the
moment
when
erasmus
got
into
the
travelling
cart
which
was
to
take
him
to
louvain
a
friend
drew
his
attention
to
a
passage
in
the
new
edition
of
faber
commentary
on
paul
epistles
in
which
he
controverted
erasmus
note
on
the
second
epistle
to
the
hebrews
verse
erasmus
at
once
bought
faber
book
and
soon
published
an
it
concerned
christ
relation
to
god
and
the
angels
but
the
dogmatic
point
at
issue
hinged
after
all
on
a
philological
interpretation
of
erasmus
not
yet
accustomed
to
much
direct
wrangling
erasmus
was
violently
agitated
by
the
matter
the
more
as
he
esteemed
faber
highly
and
considered
him
a
congenial
spirit
on
earth
has
occurred
to
the
man
have
others
set
him
on
against
me
all
theologians
agree
that
i
am
right
he
asserts
it
makes
him
nervous
that
faber
does
not
reply
again
at
once
badius
has
told
peter
gilles
that
faber
is
sorry
about
it
erasmus
in
a
dignified
letter
appeals
to
their
friendship
he
will
suffer
himself
to
be
taught
and
censured
then
again
he
growls
let
him
be
careful
and
he
thinks
that
his
controversy
with
faber
keeps
the
world
in
suspense
there
is
not
a
meal
at
which
the
guests
do
not
side
with
one
or
the
other
of
them
but
finally
the
combat
abated
and
the
friendship
was
preserved
towards
easter
erasmus
contemplated
a
new
journey
to
basle
there
to
pass
through
the
press
during
a
few
months
of
hard
labour
the
corrected
edition
of
the
new
testament
he
did
not
fail
to
request
the
chiefs
of
conservative
divinity
at
louvain
beforehand
to
state
their
objections
to
his
work
briard
of
ath
declared
he
had
found
nothing
offensive
in
it
after
he
had
first
been
told
all
sorts
of
bad
things
about
it
the
new
edition
will
please
you
much
better
erasmus
had
said
his
friend
dorp
and
james
latomus
also
one
of
the
chief
divines
had
expressed
themselves
in
the
same
sense
and
the
carmelite
nicholas
of
egmond
had
said
that
he
had
never
read
erasmus
work
only
a
young
englishman
edward
lee
who
was
studying
greek
at
louvain
had
summarized
a
number
of
criticisms
into
ten
conclusions
erasmus
had
got
rid
of
the
matter
by
writing
to
lee
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
hold
of
his
conclusions
and
therefore
could
not
make
use
of
them
but
his
youthful
critic
had
not
put
up
with
being
slighted
so
and
worked
out
his
objections
in
a
more
circumstantial
treatise
illustration

view
of
basle
thus
erasmus
set
out
for
basle
once
more
in
may
he
had
been
obliged
to
ask
all
his
english
friends
of
whom
ammonius
had
been
taken
from
him
by
death
in
for
support
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
journey
he
kept
holding
out
to
them
the
prospect
that
after
his
work
was
finished
he
would
return
to
england
in
a
letter
to
martin
lypsius
as
he
was
going
up
the
rhine
he
answered
lee
criticism
which
had
irritated
him
extremely
in
revising
his
edition
he
not
only
took
it
but
little
into
account
but
ventured
moreover
this
time
to
print
his
own
translation
of
the
new
testament
of
without
any
alterations
at
the
same
time
he
obtained
for
the
new
edition
a
letter
of
approval
from
the
pope
a
redoubtable
weapon
against
his
cavillers
at
basle
erasmus
worked
again
like
a
horse
in
a
treadmill
but
he
was
really
in
his
element
even
before
the
second
edition
of
the
new
testament
the
and
the
principis
were
reprinted
by
froben
on
his
return
journey
erasmus
whose
work
had
been
hampered
all
through
the
summer
by
indisposition
and
who
had
on
that
account
been
unable
to
finish
it
fell
seriously
ill
he
reached
louvain
with
difficulty
september
it
might
be
the
pestilence
and
erasmus
ever
much
afraid
of
contagion
himself
now
took
all
precautions
to
safeguard
his
friends
against
it
he
avoided
his
quarters
in
the
college
of
the
lily
and
found
shelter
with
his
most
trusted
friend
dirck
maertensz
the
printer
but
in
spite
of
rumours
of
the
plague
and
his
warnings
first
dorp
and
afterwards
also

at
once
to
visit

evidently
the

professors
did
not
mean
so
badly
by
him
after
all
illustration

of

the
differences
between

were
deeply
rooted

by
the
little
attention
paid
by
erasmus
to
his
objections
prepared
a
new
critique
but
kept
it
from
erasmus
for
the
present
which
irritated
the
latter
and
made
him
nervous
in
the
meantime
a
new
opponent
arose
directly
after
his
return
to
louvain
erasmus
had
taken
much
trouble
to
promote
the
establishment
of
the
projected
and
endowed
by
jerome
busleiden
in
his
testament
to
be
founded
in
the
university
the
three
biblical
languages
hebrew
greek
and
latin
were
to
be
taught

when
james
latomus
a
member
of

theological
faculty
and
a
man
whom
he
esteemed
in
a
dialogue
about
the
study
of
those
three
languages
and
of
theology
doubted
the
utility
of
the
former

judged
himself
concerned

answered
latomus
in

he
got
into

of
marriage

had

compatriot
erasmus
on
his
part
irritated
him
furtively
he
reveals
in
this
whole
dispute
a
lack
of
and
dignity
which
shows
his
weakest
side
usually
so
anxious
as
to
decorum
he
now
lapses
into
invectives
the
british
adder
satan
even
the
old
taunt
ascribing
a
tail
to
englishmen
has
to
serve
once
more
the
points
at
issue
disappear
altogether
behind
the
bitter
mutual
reproaches
in
his
unrestrained
anger
erasmus
avails
himself
of
the
most
unworthy
weapons
he
eggs
his
german
friends
on
to
write
against
lee
and
to
ridicule
him
in
all
his
folly
and
brag
and
then
he
assures
all
his
english
friends
germany
is
literally
furious
with
lee
i
have
the
greatest
trouble
in
keeping
them
back
alack
germany
had
other
causes
of
disturbance
it
is
and
the
three
great
polemics
of
luther
were
setting
the
world
on
fire
though
one
may
excuse
the
violence
and
the
petty
spitefulness
of
erasmus
in
this
matter
as
resulting
from
an
heart
falling
somewhat
short
in
really
manly
qualities
yet
it
is
difficult
to
deny
that
he
failed
completely
to
understand
both
the
arguments
of
his
adversaries
and
the
great
movements
of
his
time
it
was
very
easy
for
erasmus
to
mock
the
of
conservative
divines
who
thought
that
there
would
be
an
end
to
faith
in
holy
scripture
as
soon
as
the
emendation
of
the
text
was
attempted
they
correct
the
holy
gospel
nay
the
pater
noster
itself
the
preacher
exclaims
indignantly
in
the
sermon
before
his
surprised
congregation
as
if
i
cavilled
at
matthew
and
luke
and
not
at
those
who
out
of
ignorance
and
carelessness
have
corrupted
them
what
do
people
wish
that
the
church
should
possess
holy
scripture
as
correct
as
possible
or
not
this
reasoning
seemed
to
erasmus
with
his
passionate
need
of
purity
a
conclusive
refutation
but
instinct
did
not
deceive
his
adversaries
when
it
told
them
that
doctrine
itself
was
at
stake
if
the
linguistic
judgement
of
a
single
individual
might
decide
as
to
the
correct
version
of
a
text
and
erasmus
wished
to
avoid
the
inferences
which
assailed
doctrine
he
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
his
conceptions
of
the
church
the
sacraments
and
the
dogmas
were
no
longer
purely
catholic
because
they
had
become
subordinated
to
his
philological
insight
he
could
not
be
aware
of
it
because
in
spite
of
all
his
natural
piety
and
his
fervent
ethical
sentiments
he
lacked
the
mystic
insight
which
is
the
foundation
of
every
creed
it
was
this
personal
lack
in
erasmus
which
made
him
unable
to
understand
the
real
grounds
of
the
resistance
of
catholic
orthodoxy
how
was
it
possible
that
so
many
and
among
them
men
of
high
consideration
refused
to
accept
what
to
him
seemed
so
clear
and
irrefutable
he
interpreted
the
fact
in
a
highly
personal
way
he
the
man
who
would
so
gladly
have
lived
in
peace
with
all
the
world
who
so
yearned
for
sympathy
and
recognition
and
bore
enmity
with
difficulty
saw
the
ranks
of
haters
and
opponents
increase
about
him
he
did
not
understand
how
they
feared
his
mocking
acrimony
how
many
wore
the
scar
of
a
wound
that
the
had
made
that
real
and
supposed
hatred
troubled
erasmus
he
sees
his
enemies
as
a
sect
it
is
especially
the
dominicans
and
the
carmelites
who
are
towards
the
new
scientific
theology
just
then
a
new
adversary
had
arisen
at
louvain
in
the
person
of
his
compatriot
nicholas
of
egmond
prior
of
the
carmelites
henceforth
an
object
of
particular
abhorrence
to
him
it
is
remarkable
that
at
louvain
erasmus
found
his
fiercest
opponents
in
some
compatriots
in
the
narrower
sense
of
the
word
vincent
dirks
of
haarlem
william
of
vianen
ruurd
tapper
the
persecution
increases
the
venom
of
slander
spreads
more
and
more
every
day
and
becomes
more
deadly
the
greatest
untruths
are
impudently
preached
about
him
he
calls
in
the
help
of
ath
the
against
them
but
it
is
no
use
the
hidden
enemies
laugh
let
him
write
for
the
erudite
who
are
few
we
shall
bark
to
stir
up
the
people
after
he
writes
again
and
again
am
stoned
every
day
but
erasmus
however
much
he
might
see
himself
not
without
reason
at
the
centre
could
in
and
no
longer
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
great
struggle
did
not
concern
him
alone
on
all
sides
the
battle
was
being
fought
what
is
it
that
great
commotion
about
matters
of
spirit
and
of
faith
the
answer
which
erasmus
gave
himself
was
this
it
is
a
great
and
wilful
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
conservatives
to
suffocate
good
learning
and
make
the
old
ignorance
triumph
this
idea
recurs
innumerable
times
in
his
letters
after
the
middle
of
know
quite
certainly
he
writes
on
march
to
one
of
his
german
friends
the
barbarians
on
all
sides
have
conspired
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
till
they
have
suppressed
we
are
still
fighting
with
the
protectors
of
the
old
ignorance
can
not
wolsey
persuade
the
pope
to
stop
it
here
all
that
appertains
to
ancient
and
cultured
literature
is
called
by
those
fellows
by
that
word
they
indicate
everything
that
savours
of
a
more
elegant
doctrine
that
is
to
say
all
that
they
have
not
learned
themselves
all
the
tumult
the
whole
tragedy
under
these
terms
he
usually
refers
to
the
great
theological
struggle
originates
in
the
hatred
of
is
the
source
and
of
all
this
tragedy
incurable
hatred
of
linguistic
study
and
the
provokes
those
enemies
whom
it
is
impossible
to
conquer
though
their
cause
is
a
bad
one
and
meanwhile
envy
harasses
the
which
are
attacked
at
his
luther
instigation
by
these
gadflies
they
are
already
nearly
insufferable
when
things
do
not
go
well
with
them
but
who
can
stand
them
when
they
triumph
either
i
am
blind
or
they
aim
at
something
else
than
luther
they
are

this
was
written
by
erasmus
to
a
member
of
the
university
of
leipzig
in
december
this
and
academic
conception
of
the
great
events
a
conception
which
arose
in
the
study
of
a
recluse
bending
over
his
books
did
more
than
anything
else
to
prevent
erasmus
from
understanding
the
true

and

october
about
the
close
of
erasmus
received
a
letter
from
the
librarian
and
secretary
of
frederick
elector
of
saxony
george
spalatinus
written
in
the
respectful
and
reverential
tone
in
which
the
great
man
was
now
approached
all
esteem
you
here
most
highly
the
elector
has
all
your
books
in
his
library
and
intends
to
buy
everything
you
may
publish
in
future
but
the
object
of
spalatinus
letter
was
the
execution
of
a
friend
commission
an
augustinian
ecclesiastic
a
great
admirer
of
erasmus
had
requested
him
to
direct
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
his
interpretation
of
paul
especially
in
that
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
erasmus
had
failed
to
conceive
the
idea
of
correctly
had
paid
too
little
attention
to
original
sin
he
might
profit
by
reading
augustine
the
nameless
austin
friar
was
luther
then
still
unknown
outside
the
circle
of
the
wittenberg
university
in
which
he
was
a
professor
and
the
criticism
regarded
the
cardinal
point
of
his
hardly
acquired
conviction
justification
by
faith
erasmus
paid
little
attention
to
this
letter
he
received
so
many
of
that
sort
containing
still
more
praise
and
no
criticism
if
he
answered
it
the
reply
did
not
reach
spalatinus
and
later
erasmus
completely
forgot
the
whole
letter
nine
months
afterwards
in
september
when
erasmus
had
been
at
louvain
for
a
short
time
he
received
an
honourable
invitation
written
by
the
first
prelate
of
the
empire
the
young
archbishop
of
mayence
albert
of
brandenburg
the
archbishop
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
on
an
occasion
he
greatly
admired
his
work
he
knew
it
so
little
as
to
speak
of
erasmus
emendation
of
the
old
testament
instead
of
the
new
and
hoped
that
he
would
one
day
write
some
lives
of
saints
in
elegant
style
the
young
hohenzoller
advocate
of
the
new
light
of
classical
studies
whose
attention
had
probably
been
drawn
to
erasmus
by
hutten
and
capito
who
sojourned
at
his
court
had
recently
become
engaged
in
one
of
the
boldest
political
and
financial
transactions
of
his
time
his
elevation
to
the
see
of
mayence
at
the
age
of
had
necessitated
a
papal
dispensation
as
he
also
wished
to
keep
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
and
the
see
of
halberstadt
this
accumulation
of
ecclesiastical
offices
had
to
be
made
subservient
to
the
brandenburg
policy
which
opposed
the
rival
house
of
saxony
the
pope
granted
the
dispensation
in
return
for
a
great
sum
of
money
but
to
facilitate
its
payment
he
accorded
to
the
archbishop
a
liberal
indulgence
for
the
whole
archbishopric
of
mayence
magdeburg
and
the
brandenburg
territories
albert
to
whom
half
the
proceeds
were
tacitly
left
raised
a
loan
with
the
house
of
fugger
and
this
charged
itself
with
the
indulgence
traffic
when
in
december
erasmus
answered
the
archbishop
propositions
against
indulgences
provoked
by
the
archbishop
of
mayence
instructions
regarding
their
colportage
had
already
been
posted
up
october
and
were
circulated
throughout
germany
rousing
the
whole
church
they
were
levelled
at
the
same
abuses
which
erasmus
combated
the
mechanical
atomistical
and
juridical
conception
of
religion
but
how
different
was
their
practical
effect
as
compared
with
erasmus
pacific
endeavour
to
purify
the
church
by
lenient
means
of
saints
erasmus
asked
replying
to
the
archbishop
have
tried
in
my
poor
way
to
add
a
little
light
to
the
prince
of
saints
himself
for
the
rest
your
endeavour
in
addition
to
so
many
difficult
matters
of
government
and
at
such
an
early
age
to
get
the
lives
of
the
saints
purged
of
old
women
tales
and
disgusting
style
is
extremely
laudable
for
nothing
should
be
suffered
in
the
church
that
is
not
perfectly
pure
or
refined
and
he
concludes
with
a
magnificent
eulogy
of
the
excellent
prelate
during
the
greater
part
of
erasmus
was
too
much
occupied
by
his
own
affairs
the
journey
to
basle
and
his
labours
there
and
afterwards
his
serious
illness
to
concern
himself
much
with
business
in
march
he
sends
luther
theses
to
more
without
comment
and
in
passing
complains
to
colet
about
the
impudence
with
which
rome
disseminates
indulgences
luther
now
declared
a
heretic
and
summoned
to
appear
at
augsburg
stands
before
the
legate
cajetanus
and
refuses
to
recant
seething
enthusiasm
surrounds
him
just
about
that
time
erasmus
writes
to
one
of
luther
partisans
john
lang
in
very
favourable
terms
about
his
work
the
theses
have
pleased
everybody
see
that
the
monarchy
of
the
pope
at
rome
as
it
is
now
is
a
pestilence
to
christendom
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
expedient
to
touch
that
sore
openly
that
would
be
a
matter
for
princes
but
i
fear
that
these
will
act
in
concert
with
the
pope
to
secure
part
of
the
spoils
i
do
not
understand
what
possessed
eck
to
take
up
arms
against
luther
the
letter
did
not
find
its
way
into
any
of
the
collections
the
year
brought
the
struggle
attending
the
election
of
an
emperor
after
old
maximilian
had
died
in
january
and
the
attempt
of
the
curia
to
regain
ground
with
lenity
germany
was
expecting
the
disputation
between
johannes
eck
and
andreas
karlstadt
which
in
truth
would
concern
luther
how
could
erasmus
who
himself
was
involved
that
year
in
so
many
polemics
have
foreseen
that
the
leipzig
disputation
which
was
to
lead
luther
to
the
consequence
of
rejecting
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authority
would
remain
of
lasting
importance
in
the
history
of
the
world
whereas
his
quarrel
with
lee
would
be
forgotten
on
march
luther
addressed
himself
personally
to
erasmus
for
the
first
time
speak
with
you
so
often
and
you
with
me
erasmus
our
ornament
and
our
hope
and
we
do
not
know
each
other
as
yet
he
rejoices
to
find
that
erasmus
displeases
many
for
this
he
regards
as
a
sign
that
god
has
blessed
him
now
that
his
luther
name
begins
to
get
known
too
a
longer
silence
between
them
might
be
wrongly
interpreted
my
erasmus
amiable
man
if
you
think
fit
acknowledge
also
this
little
brother
in
christ
who
really
admires
you
and
feels
friendly
disposed
towards
you
and
for
the
rest
would
deserve
no
better
because
of
his
ignorance
than
to
lie
unknown
buried
in
a
corner
there
was
a
very
definite
purpose
in
this
somewhat
rustically
cunning
and
half
ironical
letter
luther
wanted
if
possible
to
make
erasmus
show
his
colours
to
win
him
the
powerful
authority
touchstone
of
science
and
culture
for
the
cause
which
he
advocated
in
his
heart
luther
had
long
been
aware
of
the
deep
gulf
separating
him
from
erasmus
as
early
as
march
six
months
before
his
public
appearance
he
wrote
about
erasmus
to
john
lang
matters
weigh
heavier
with
him
than
divine
an
opinion
that
so
many
have
pronounced
about
erasmus
obvious
and
yet
unfair
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
luther
to
effect
a
was
a
reason
for
erasmus
to
retire
at
once
now
began
that
extremely
ambiguous
policy
of
erasmus
to
preserve
peace
by
his
authority
as
a
light
of
the
world
and
to
steer
a
middle
course
without
committing
himself
in
that
attitude
the
great
and
the
petty
side
of
his
personality
are
inextricably
intertwined
the
error
because
of
which
most
historians
have
seen
erasmus
attitude
towards
the
reformation
either
in
far
too
unfavourable
a
light
or
as
for
instance
the
german
historian
kalkoff
much
too
heroic
and
is
that
they
erroneously
regard
him
as
psychologically
homogeneous
just
that
he
is
not
his
roots
in
the
depths
of
his
being
many
of
his
utterances
during
the
struggle
proceed
directly
from
his
fear
and
lack
of
character
also
from
his
inveterate
dislike
of
siding
with
a
person
or
a
cause
but
behind
that
is
always
his
deep
and
fervent
conviction
that
neither
of
the
conflicting
opinions
can
completely
express
the
truth
that
human
hatred
and
purblindness
infatuate
men
minds
and
with
that
conviction
is
allied
the
noble
illusion
that
it
might
yet
be
possible
to
preserve
the
peace
by
moderation
insight
and
kindliness
in
april
erasmus
addressed
himself
by
letter
to
the
elector
frederick
of
saxony
luther
patron
he
begins
by
alluding
to
his
dedication
of
suetonius
two
years
before
but
his
real
purpose
is
to
say
something
about
luther
luther
writings
he
says
have
given
the
louvain
obscurants
plenty
of
reason
to
inveigh
against
the
to
decry
all
scholars
he
himself
does
not
know
luther
and
has
glanced
through
his
writings
only
cursorily
as
yet
but
everyone
praises
his
life
how
little
in
accordance
with
theological
gentleness
it
is
to
condemn
him
offhand
and
that
before
the
indiscreet
vulgar
for
has
he
not
proposed
a
dispute
and
submitted
himself
to
everybody
judgement
no
one
has
so
far
admonished
taught
convinced
him
every
error
is
not
at
once
heresy
the
best
of
christianity
is
a
life
worthy
of
christ
where
we
find
that
we
should
not
rashly
suspect
people
of
heresy
why
do
we
so
uncharitably
persecute
the
lapses
of
others
though
none
of
us
is
free
from
error
why
do
we
rather
want
to
conquer
than
cure
suppress
than
instruct
but
he
concludes
with
a
word
that
could
not
but
please
luther
friends
who
so
hoped
for
his
support
the
duke
prevent
an
innocent
man
from
being
surrendered
under
the
cloak
of
piety
to
the
impiety
of
a
few
this
is
also
the
wish
of
pope
leo
who
has
nothing
more
at
heart
than
that
innocence
be
safe
at
this
same
time
erasmus
does
his
best
to
keep
froben
back
from
publishing
luther
writings
they
may
not
fan
the
hatred
of
the
still
more
and
he
keeps
repeating
i
do
not
know
luther
i
have
not
read
his
writings
he
makes
this
declaration
to
luther
himself
in
his
reply
to
the
latter
epistle
of
march
this
letter
of
erasmus
dated
may
should
be
regarded
as
a
newspaper
leader
to
acquaint
the
public
with
his
attitude
towards
the
luther
question
luther
does
not
know
the
tragedies
which
his
writings
have
caused
at
louvain
people
here
think
that
erasmus
has
helped
him
in
composing
them
and
call
him
the
standard
bearer
of
the
party
that
seemed
to
them
a
fitting
pretext
to
suppress
the
have
declared
that
you
are
perfectly
unknown
to
me
that
i
have
not
yet
read
your
books
and
therefore
neither
approve
nor
disapprove
anything
reserve
myself
so
far
as
i
may
to
be
of
use
to
the
reviving
studies
discreet
moderation
seems
likely
to
bring
better
progress
than
impetuosity
it
was
by
this
that
christ
subjugated
the
world
on
the
same
day
he
writes
to
john
lang
one
of
luther
friends
and
followers
a
short
note
not
meant
for
publication
hope
that
the
endeavours
of
yourself
and
your
party
will
be
successful
here
the
papists
rave
violently
all
the
best
minds
are
rejoiced
at
boldness
i
do
not
doubt
he
will
be
careful
that
things
do
not
end
in
a
quarrel
of
parties
we
shall
never
triumph
over
feigned
christians
unless
we
first
abolish
the
tyranny
of
the
roman
see
and
of
its
satellites
the
dominicans
the
franciscans
and
the
carmelites
but
no
one
could
attempt
that
without
a
serious
tumult
as
the
gulf
widens
erasmus
protestations
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
luther
become
much
more
frequent
relations
at
louvain
grow
ever
more
disagreeable
and
the
general
sentiment
about
him
ever
more
unkind
in
august
he
turns
to
the
pope
himself
for
protection
against
his
opponents
he
still
fails
to
see
how
wide
the
breach
is
he
still
takes
it
all
to
be
quarrels
of
scholars
king
henry
of
england
and
king
francis
of
france
in
their
own
countries
have
imposed
silence
upon
the
quarrellers
and
slanderers
if
only
the
pope
would
do
the
same
in
october
he
was
once
more
reconciled
with
the
louvain
faculty
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
colet
died
in
london
the
man
who
had
better
perhaps
than
anyone
else
understood
erasmus
standpoint
kindred
spirits
in
germany
still
looked
up
to
erasmus
as
the
great
man
who
was
on
the
alert
to
interpose
at
the
right
moment
and
who
had
made
moderation
the
watchword
until
the
time
should
come
to
give
his
friends
the
signal
but
in
the
increasing
noise
of
the
battle
his
voice
already
sounded
less
powerfully
than
before
a
letter
to
cardinal
albert
of
mayence
october
of
about
the
same
content
as
that
of
frederick
of
saxony
written
in
the
preceding
spring
was
at
once
circulated
by
friends
and
by
the
advocates
of
conservatism
in
spite
of
the
usual
protestation
do
not
know
luther
it
was
made
to
serve
against
erasmus
it
became
more
and
more
clear
that
the
mediating
and
conciliatory
position
which
erasmus
wished
to
take
up
would
soon
be
altogether
untenable
the
inquisitor
jacob
hoogstraten
had
come
from
cologne
where
he
was
a
member
of
the
university
to
louvain
to
work
against
luther
there
as
he
had
worked
against
reuchlin
on
november
the
louvain
faculty
following
the
example
of
that
of
cologne
proceeded
to
take
the
decisive
step
the
solemn
condemnation
of
a
number
of
luther
opinions
in
future
no
place
could
be
less
suitable
to
erasmus
than
louvain
the
citadel
of
action
against
reformers
it
is
surprising
that
he
remained
there
another
two
years
the
expectation
that
he
would
be
able
to
speak
the
conciliating
word
was
paling
for
the
rest
he
failed
to
see
the
true
proportions
during
the
first
months
of
his
attention
was
almost
entirely
taken
up
by
his
own
polemics
with
lee
a
paltry
incident
in
the
great
revolution
the
desire
to
keep
aloof
got
more
and
more
the
upper
hand
of
him
in
june
he
writes
to
melanchthon
see
that
matters
begin
to
look
like
sedition
it
is
perhaps
necessary
that
scandals
occur
but
i
should
prefer
not
to
be
the
author
he
has
he
thinks
by
his
influence
with
wolsey
prevented
the
burning
of
luther
writings
in
england
which
had
been
ordered
but
he
was
mistaken
the
burning
had
taken
place
in
london
as
early
as
may
the
best
proof
that
erasmus
had
practically
given
up
his
hope
to
play
a
conciliatory
part
may
be
found
in
what
follows
in
the
summer
of
the
famous
meeting
between
the
three
monarchs
henry
viii
francis
i
and
charles
v
took
place
at
calais
erasmus
was
to
go
there
in
the
train
of
his
prince
how
would
such
a
congress
of
princes
where
in
peaceful
conclave
the
interests
of
france
england
spain
the
german
empire
and
a
considerable
part
of
italy
were
represented
together
have
affected
erasmus
imagination
if
his
ideal
had
remained
unshaken
but
there
are
no
traces
of
this
erasmus
was
at
calais
in
july
had
some
conversation
with
henry
viii
there
and
greeted
more
but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
attached
any
other
importance
to
the
journey
than
that
of
an
opportunity
for
the
last
time
to
greet
his
english
friends
it
was
awkward
for
erasmus
that
just
at
this
time
when
the
cause
of
faith
took
so
much
harsher
forms
his
duties
as
counsellor
to
the
youthful
charles
now
back
from
spain
to
be
crowned
as
emperor
circumscribed
his
liberty
more
than
before
in
the
summer
of
appeared
based
on
the
incriminating
material
furnished
by
the
louvain
faculty
the
papal
bull
declaring
luther
to
be
a
heretic
and
unless
he
should
speedily
recant
excommunicating
him
fear
the
worst
for
the
unfortunate
luther
erasmus
writes
september
does
conspiracy
rage
everywhere
so
are
princes
incensed
with
him
on
all
sides
and
most
of
all
pope
leo
would
luther
had
followed
my
advice
and
abstained
from
those
hostile
and
seditious
actions
they
will
not
rest
until
they
have
quite
subverted
the
study
of
languages
and
the
good
learning
out
of
the
hatred
against
these
and
the
stupidity
of
monks
did
this
tragedy
first
arise
i
do
not
meddle
with
it
for
the
rest
a
bishopric
is
waiting
for
me
if
i
choose
to
write
against
luther
indeed
erasmus
had
become
by
virtue
of
his
enormous
celebrity
as
circumstances
would
have
it
more
and
more
a
valuable
asset
in
the
great
policy
of
emperor
and
pope
people
wanted
to
use
his
name
and
make
him
choose
sides
and
that
he
would
not
do
for
any
consideration
he
wrote
evasively
to
the
pope
about
his
relations
with
luther
without
altogether
disavowing
him
how
zealously
he
defends
himself
from
the
suspicion
of
being
on
luther
side
as
noisy
monks
make
out
in
their
sermons
who
summarily
link
the
two
in
their
scoffing
disparagement
but
by
the
other
side
also
he
is
pressed
to
choose
sides
and
to
speak
out
towards
the
end
of
october
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
took
place
at
erasmus
was
perhaps
present
in
any
case
he
accompanied
the
emperor
to
cologne
there
on
november
he
had
an
interview
about
luther
with
the
elector
frederick
of
saxony
he
was
persuaded
to
write
down
the
result
of
that
discussion
in
the
form
of
concerning
luther
against
his
intention
they
were
printed
at
once
erasmus
hesitation
in
those
days
between
the
repudiation
and
the
approbation
of
luther
is
not
discreditable
to
him
it
is
the
tragic
defect
running
through
his
whole
personality
his
refusal
or
inability
ever
to
draw
ultimate
conclusions
had
he
only
been
a
calculating
and
selfish
nature
afraid
of
losing
his
life
he
would
long
since
have
altogether
forsaken
luther
cause
it
is
his
misfortune
affecting
his
fame
that
he
continually
shows
his
weaknesses
whereas
what
is
great
in
him
lies
deep
at
cologne
erasmus
also
met
the
man
with
whom
as
a
promising
young
humanist
fourteen
years
younger
than
himself
he
had
for
some
months
shared
a
room
in
the
house
of
aldus
at
venice
hieronymus
aleander
now
sent
to
the
emperor
as
a
papal
nuncio
to
persuade
him
to
conform
his
imperial
policy
to
that
of
the
pope
in
the
matter
of
the
great
ecclesiastical
question
and
give
effect
to
the
papal
excommunication
by
the
imperial
ban
it
must
have
been
somewhat
painful
for
erasmus
that
his
friend
had
so
far
surpassed
him
in
power
and
position
and
was
now
called
to
bring
by
diplomatic
means
the
solution
which
he
himself
would
have
liked
to
see
achieved
by
ideal
harmony
good
will
and
toleration
he
had
never
trusted
aleander
and
was
more
than
ever
on
his
guard
against
him
as
a
humanist
in
spite
of
brilliant
gifts
aleander
was
by
far
inferior
and
had
never
like
him
risen
from
literature
to
serious
theological
studies
he
had
simply
prospered
in
the
service
of
church
magnates
whom
erasmus
had
given
up
early
this
man
was
now
invested
with
the
highest
mediating
powers
to
what
degree
of
exasperation
erasmus
most
violent
antagonists
at
louvain
had
now
been
reduced
is
seen
from
the
witty
and
slightly
malicious
account
he
gives
thomas
more
of
his
meeting
with
egmondanus
before
the
rector
of
the
university
who
wanted
to
reconcile
them
still
things
did
not
look
so
black
as
ulrich
von
hutten
thought
when
he
wrote
to
erasmus
you
think
that
you
are
still
safe
now
that
books
are
burned
fly
and
save
yourself
for
us
ever
more
emphatic
do
erasmus
protestations
become
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
luther
long
ago
he
had
already
requested
him
not
to
mention
his
name
and
luther
promised
it
well
then
i
shall
not
again
refer
to
you
neither
will
other
good
friends
since
it
troubles
you
ever
louder
too
are
erasmus
complaints
about
the
raving
of
the
monks
at
him
and
his
demands
that
the
mendicant
orders
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
preach
in
april
comes
the
moment
in
the
world
history
to
which
christendom
has
been
looking
forward
luther
at
the
diet
of
worms
holding
fast
to
his
opinions
confronted
by
the
highest
authority
in
the
empire
so
great
is
the
rejoicing
in
germany
that
for
a
moment
it
may
seem
that
the
emperor
power
is
in
danger
rather
than
luther
and
his
adherents
i
had
been
present
writes
erasmus
should
have
endeavoured
that
this
tragedy
would
have
been
so
tempered
by
moderate
arguments
that
it
could
not
afterwards
break
out
again
to
the
still
greater
detriment
of
the
world
the
imperial
sentence
was
pronounced
within
the
empire
as
in
the
burgundian
netherlands
before
that
time
luther
books
were
to
be
burned
his
adherents
arrested
and
their
goods
confiscated
and
luther
was
to
be
given
up
to
the
authorities
erasmus
hopes
that
now
relief
will
follow
luther
tragedy
is
at
an
end
with
us
here
would
it
had
never
appeared
on
the
stage
in
these
days
albrecht
dürer
on
hearing
the
false
news
of
luther
death
wrote
in
the
diary
of
his
journey
that
passionate
exclamation
erasmus
of
rotterdam
where
will
you
be
hear
you
knight
of
christ
ride
forth
beside
the
lord
christ
protect
the
truth
obtain
the
martyr
crown
for
you
are
but
an
old
manikin
i
have
heard
you
say
that
you
have
allowed
yourself
two
more
years
in
which
you
are
still
fit
to
do
some
work
spend
them
well
in
behalf
of
the
gospel
and
the
true
christian
faith
o
erasmus
be
on
this
side
that
god
may
be
proud
of
you
it
expresses
confidence
in
erasmus
power
but
at
bottom
is
the
expectation
that
he
will
not
do
all
this
dürer
had
rightly
understood
erasmus
the
struggle
abated
nowise
least
of
all
at
louvain
latomus
the
most
dignified
and
able
of
louvain
divines
had
now
become
one
of
the
most
serious
opponents
of
luther
and
in
so
doing
touched
erasmus
too
indirectly
to
nicholas
of
egmond
the
carmelite
another
of
compatriots
had
been
added
as
a
violent
antagonist
vincent
dirks
of
haarlem
a
dominican
erasmus
addresses
himself
to
the
faculty
to
defend
himself
against
the
new
attacks
and
to
explain
why
he
has
never
written
against
luther
he
will
read
him
he
will
soon
take
up
something
to
quiet
the
tumult
he
succeeds
in
getting
aleander
who
arrived
at
louvain
in
june
to
prohibit
preaching
against
him
the
pope
still
hopes
that
aleander
will
succeed
in
bringing
back
erasmus
with
whom
he
is
again
on
friendly
terms
to
the
right
track
but
erasmus
began
to
consider
the
only
exit
which
was
now
left
to
him
to
leave
louvain
and
the
netherlands
to
regain
his
menaced
independence
the
occasion
to
depart
had
long
ago
presented
itself
the
third
edition
of
his
new
testament
called
him
to
basle
once
more
it
would
not
be
a
permanent
departure
and
he
purposed
to
return
to
louvain
on
october
his
birthday
he
left
the
town
where
he
had
spent
four
difficult
years
his
chambers
in
the
college
of
the
lily
were
reserved
for
him
and
he
left
his
books
behind
on
november
he
reached
basle
soon
the
rumour
spread
that
out
of
fear
of
aleander
he
had
saved
himself
by
flight
but
the
idea
revived
again
in
our
days
in
spite
of
own
painstaking
denial
that
aleander
should
have
cunningly
and
expressly
driven
him
from
the
netherlands
is
inherently
improbable
so
far
as
the
church
was
concerned
erasmus
would
at
almost
any
point
be
more
dangerous
than
at
louvain
in
the
headquarters
of
conservatism
under
immediate
control
of
the
strict
burgundian
government
where
it
seemed
he
could
sooner
or
later
be
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
policy
it
was
this
contingency
as
allen
has
correctly
pointed
out
which
he
feared
and
evaded
not
for
his
bodily
safety
did
he
emigrate
erasmus
would
not
have
been
touched
he
was
far
too
valuable
an
asset
for
such
measures
it
was
his
mental
independence
so
dear
to
him
above
all
else
that
he
felt
to
be
threatened
and
to
safeguard
that
he
did
not
return
to
louvain

had

what
people
said
or
thought
of
him
even
at
basle
he
did
not
feel
thoroughly
at
home
he
still
speaks
repeatedly
of
a
removal
in
the
near
future
to
rome
to
france
to
england
or
back
to
the
netherlands
physical
rest
at
any
rate
which
was
not
in
him
was
granted
him
by
circumstances
for
nearly
eight
years
he
now
remained
at
basle
and
then
he
lived
at
freiburg
for
six
erasmus
at
basle
is
a
man
whose
ideals
of
the
world
and
society
have
failed
him
what
remains
of
that
happy
expectation
of
a
golden
age
of
peace
and
light
in
which
he
had
believed
as
late
as
what
of
his
trust
in
good
will
and
rational
insight
in
which
he
wrote
the
principis
for
the
youthful
charles
v
to
erasmus
all
the
weal
of
state
and
society
had
always
been
merely
a
matter
of
personal
morality
and
intellectual
enlightenment
by
recommending
and
spreading
those
two
he
at
one
time
thought
he
had
introduced
the
great
renovation
himself
from
the
moment
when
he
saw
that
the
conflict
would
lead
to
an
exasperated
struggle
he
refused
any
longer
to
be
anything
but
a
spectator
as
an
actor
in
the
great
ecclesiastical
combat
erasmus
had
voluntarily
left
the
stage
but
he
does
not
give
up
his
ideal
us
resist
he
concludes
an
epistle
about
gospel
philosophy
by
taunts
and
threats
not
by
force
of
arms
and
injustice
but
by
simple
discretion
by
benefits
by
gentleness
and
tolerance
towards
the
close
of
his
life
he
prays
thou
o
god
deignst
to
renew
that
holy
spirit
in
the
hearts
of
all
then
also
will
those
external
disasters
cease
bring
order
to
this
chaos
lord
jesus
let
thy
spirit
spread
over
these
waters
of
sadly
troubled
dogmas
concord
peace
sense
of
duty
and
kindliness
were
all
valued
highly
by
erasmus
yet
he
rarely
saw
them
realized
in
practical
life
he
becomes
disillusioned
after
the
short
spell
of
political
optimism
he
never
speaks
of
the
times
any
more
but
in
bitter
terms
a
most
criminal
age
he
says
and
again
the
most
unhappy
and
most
depraved
age
imaginable
in
vain
had
he
always
written
in
the
cause
of
peace
the
complaint
of
peace
the
adage
bellum
war
is
sweet
to
those
who
have
not
known
it
de
pace
et
and
more
still
erasmus
thought
rather
highly
of
his
pacifistic
labours
polygraph
who
never
leaves
off
persecuting
war
by
means
of
his
pen
thus
he
makes
a
character
of
the
designate
himself
according
to
a
tradition
noted
by
melanchthon
pope
julius
is
said
to
have
called
him
before
him
in
connection
with
his
advice
about
the
war
with
venice
and
to
have
remarked
to
him
angrily
that
he
should
stop
writing
on
the
concerns
of
princes
do
not
understand
those
things
erasmus
had
in
spite
of
a
certain
innate
moderation
a
wholly
mind
he
lived
too
much
outside
of
practical
reality
and
thought
too
naïvely
of
the
corrigibility
of
mankind
to
realize
the
difficulties
and
necessities
of
government
his
ideas
about
a
good
administration
were
extremely
primitive
and
as
is
often
the
case
with
scholars
of
a
strong
ethical
bias
very
revolutionary
at
bottom
though
he
never
dreamed
of
drawing
the
practical
inferences
his
friendship
with
political
and
juridical
thinkers
as
more
budaeus
and
zasius
had
not
changed
him
questions
of
forms
of
government
law
or
right
did
not
exist
for
him
economic
problems
he
saw
in
idyllic
simplicity
the
prince
should
reign
gratuitously
and
impose
as
few
taxes
as
possible
good
prince
has
all
that
loving
citizens
possess
the
unemployed
should
be
simply
driven
away
we
feel
in
closer
contact
with
the
world
of
facts
when
he
enumerates
the
works
of
peace
for
the
prince
the
cleaning
of
towns
building
of
bridges
halls
and
streets
draining
of
pools
shifting
of
the
diking
and
reclamation
of
moors
it
is
the
netherlander
who
speaks
here
and
at
the
same
time
the
man
in
whom
the
need
of
cleansing
and
clearing
away
is
a
fundamental
trait
of
character
vague
politicians
like
erasmus
are
prone
to
judge
princes
very
severely
since
they
take
them
to
be
responsible
for
all
wrongs
erasmus
praises
them
personally
but
condemns
them
in
general
from
the
kings
of
his
time
he
had
for
a
long
time
expected
peace
in
church
and
state
they
had
disappointed
him
but
his
severe
judgement
of
princes
he
derived
rather
from
classical
reading
than
from
political
experience
of
his
own
times
in
the
later
editions
of
the
he
often
reverts
to
princes
their
task
and
their
neglect
of
duty
without
ever
mentioning
special
princes
are
those
who
sow
the
seeds
of
dissension
between
their
townships
in
order
to
fleece
the
poor
unhindered
and
to
satisfy
their
gluttony
by
the
hunger
of
innocent
citizens
in
the
adage
aquilam
he
represents
the
prince
under
the
image
of
the
eagle
as
the
great
cruel
robber
and
persecutor
in
another
regem
aut
fatuum
nasci
and
in
bellum
he
utters
his
frequently
quoted
dictum
people
found
and
develop
towns
the
folly
of
princes
devastates
them
princes
conspire
with
the
pope
and
perhaps
with
the
turk
against
the
happiness
of
the
people
he
writes
to
colet
in
he
was
an
academic
critic
writing
from
his
study
a
revolutionary
purpose
was
as
foreign
to
erasmus
as
it
was
to
more
when
writing
the
monarchs
should
perhaps
be
suffered
now
and
then
the
remedy
should
not
be
tried
it
may
be
doubted
whether
erasmus
exercised
much
real
influence
on
his
contemporaries
by
means
of
his
diatribes
against
princes
one
would
fain
believe
that
his
ardent
love
of
peace
and
bitter
arraignment
of
the
madness
of
war
had
some
effect
they
have
undoubtedly
spread
pacific
sentiments
in
the
broad
circles
of
intellectuals
who
read
erasmus
but
unfortunately
the
history
of
the
sixteenth
century
shows
little
evidence
that
such
sentiments
bore
fruit
in
actual
practice
however
this
may
be
erasmus
strength
was
not
in
these
political
declamations
he
could
never
be
a
leader
of
men
with
their
passions
and
their
harsh
interests
his
lay
elsewhere
now
at
basle
though
tormented
more
and
more
frequently
by
his
painful
complaint
which
he
had
already
carried
for
so
many
years
he
could
devote
himself
more
fully
than
ever
before
to
the
great
task
he
had
set
himself
the
opening
up
of
the
pure
sources
of
christianity
the
exposition
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
in
all
the
simple
comprehensibility
in
which
he
saw
it
in
a
broad
stream
flowed
the
editions
of
the
fathers
of
classic
authors
the
new
editions
of
the
new
testament
of
the
of
his
own
letters
together
with
paraphrases
of
the
new
testament
commentaries
on
psalms
and
a
number
of
new
theological
moral
and
philological
treatises
in
he
was
ill
for
months
on
end
yet
in
that
year
arnobius
and
the
third
edition
of
the
new
testament
succeeded
cyprian
whom
he
had
already
annotated
at
louvain
and
edited
in
closely
followed
by
hilary
in
and
next
by
a
new
edition
of
jerome
in
later
appeared
irenaeus
ambrose
augustine
and
a
latin
translation
of
chrysostom
in
the
rapid
succession
of
these
comprehensive
works
proves
that
the
work
was
done
as
erasmus
always
worked
hastily
with
an
extraordinary
power
of
concentration
and
a
surprising
command
of
his
mnemonic
faculty
but
without
severe
criticism
and
the
painful
accuracy
that
modern
philology
requires
in
such
editions
neither
the
polemical
erasmus
nor
the
witty
humorist
had
been
lost
in
the
erudite
divine
and
the
disillusioned
reformer
the
we
would
further
gladly
have
dispensed
with
but
not
the
humorist
for
many
treasures
of
literature
but
the
two
are
linked
inseparably
as
the
prove
what
was
said
about
the
may
be
repeated
here
if
in
the
literature
of
the
world
only
the
and
the
have
remained
alive
that
choice
of
history
is
right
not
in
the
sense
that
in
literature
only
erasmus
pleasantest
lightest
and
most
readable
works
were
preserved
whereas
the
ponderous
theological
erudition
was
silently
relegated
to
the
shelves
of
libraries
it
was
indeed
best
work
that
was
kept
alive
in
the
and
the
with
these
his
sparkling
wit
has
charmed
the
world
if
only
we
had
space
here
to
assign
to
the
erasmus
of
the
his
just
and
lofty
place
in
that
brilliant
constellation
of
followers
of
democritus
rabelais
ariosto
montaigne
cervantes
and
ben
jonson
when
erasmus
gave
the
their
definite
form
at
basle
they
had
already
had
a
long
and
curious
genesis
at
first
they
had
been
no
more
than
colloquiorum
models
of
colloquial
latin
conversation
written
at
paris
before
for
the
use
of
his
pupils
augustine
caminade
the
shabby
friend
who
was
fond
of
living
on
young
erasmus
genius
had
collected
them
and
had
turned
them
to
advantage
within
a
limited
compass
he
had
long
been
dead
when
one
lambert
hollonius
of
liége
sold
the
manuscript
that
he
had
got
from
caminade
to
froben
at
basle
beatus
rhenanus
although
then
already
erasmus
trusted
friend
had
it
printed
at
once
without
the
knowledge
that
was
in
erasmus
was
justly
offended
at
it
the
more
so
as
the
book
was
full
of
slovenly
blunders
and
solecisms
so
he
at
once
prepared
a
better
edition
himself
published
by
maertensz
at
louvain
in
at
that
time
the
work
really
contained
but
one
true
dialogue
the
nucleus
of
the
later
the
rest
were
formulae
of
etiquette
and
short
talks
but
already
in
this
form
it
was
apart
from
its
usefulness
to
latinists
so
full
of
happy
wit
and
humorous
invention
that
it
became
very
popular
even
before
it
had
appeared
in
editions
mostly
reprints
at
antwerp
paris
strassburg
cologne
cracow
deventer
leipzig
london
vienna
mayence
at
basle
erasmus
himself
revised
an
edition
which
was
published
in
march
by
froben
dedicated
to
the
latter
son
the
godchild
johannes
erasmius
froben
soon
after
he
did
more
than
revise
in
and
first
ten
new
dialogues
afterwards
four
and
again
six
were
added
to
the
and
at
last
in
the
title
was
changed
to
colloquiorum
it
remained
dedicated
to
the
boy
froben
and
went
on
growing
with
each
new
edition
a
rich
and
motley
collection
of
dialogues
each
a
masterpiece
of
literary
form
spontaneous
convincing
unsurpassed
in
lightness
vivacity
and
fluent
latin
each
one
a
finished
play
from
that
year
on
the
stream
of
editions
and
translations
flowed
almost
uninterruptedly
for
two
centuries
erasmus
mind
had
lost
nothing
of
its
acuteness
and
freshness
when
so
many
years
after
the
he
again
set
foot
in
the
field
of
satire
as
to
form
the
are
less
confessedly
satirical
than
the
with
its
telling
subject
the
of
the
latter
at
once
introduces
itself
as
a
satire
whereas
at
first
sight
the
might
seem
to
be
mere
innocent
but
as
to
the
contents
they
are
more
satirical
at
least
more
directly
so
the
as
a
satire
is
philosophical
and
general
the
are
up
to
date
and
special
at
the
same
time
they
combine
more
the
positive
and
negative
elements
in
the
erasmus
own
ideal
dwells
unexpressed
behind
the
representation
in
the
he
continually
and
clearly
puts
it
in
the
foreground
on
this
account
they
form
notwithstanding
all
the
jests
and
mockery
a
profoundly
serious
moral
treatise
and
are
closely
akin
to
the
militis
what
erasmus
really
demanded
of
the
world
and
of
mankind
how
he
pictured
to
himself
that
passionately
desired
purified
christian
society
of
good
morals
fervent
faith
simplicity
and
moderation
kindliness
toleration
and
peace
this
we
can
nowhere
else
find
so
clearly
and
as
in
the
in
these
last
fifteen
years
of
his
life
erasmus
resumes
by
means
of
a
series
of
disquisitions
the
topics
he
broached
in
the
the
exposition
of
simple
general
christian
conduct
untrammelled
and
natural
ethics
that
is
his
message
of
redemption
it
came
to
many
out
of
esu
christiani
but
to
far
larger
numbers
the
message
was
contained
in
the
the
gave
rise
to
much
more
hatred
and
contest
than
the
and
not
without
reason
for
in
them
erasmus
attacked
persons
he
allowed
himself
the
pleasure
of
ridiculing
his
louvain
antagonists
lee
had
already
been
introduced
as
a
sycophant
and
braggart
into
the
edition
of
and
when
the
quarrel
was
assuaged
in
the
reference
was
expunged
vincent
dirks
was
caricatured
in
as
a
covetous
friar
who
extorts
from
the
dying
testaments
in
favour
of
his
order
he
remained
later
sarcastic
observations
were
added
about
beda
and
numbers
of
others
the
adherents
of
oecolampadius
took
a
figure
with
a
long
nose
in
the
for
their
leader
no
replied
erasmus
is
meant
for
quite
another
person
henceforth
all
those
who
were
at
loggerheads
with
erasmus
and
they
were
many
ran
the
risk
of
being
pilloried
in
the
it
was
no
wonder
that
this
work
especially
with
its
scourging
mockery
of
the
monastic
orders
became
the
object
of
controversy
erasmus
never
emerged
from
his
polemics
he
was
no
doubt
serious
when
he
said
that
in
his
heart
he
abhorred
and
had
never
desired
them
but
his
caustic
mind
often
got
the
better
of
his
heart
and
having
once
begun
to
quarrel
he
undoubtedly
enjoyed
giving
his
mockery
the
rein
and
wielding
his
facile
dialectic
pen
for
understanding
his
personality
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
deal
at
large
with
all
those
fights
on
paper
only
the
most
important
ones
need
be
mentioned
since
a
pot
had
been
boiling
for
erasmus
in
spain
a
theologian
of
the
university
at
alcalá
diego
lopez
zuñiga
or
in
latin
stunica
had
been
preparing
annotations
to
the
edition
of
the
new
testament
second
lee
said
erasmus
at
first
cardinal
ximenes
had
prohibited
the
publication
but
in
after
his
death
the
storm
broke
for
some
years
stunica
kept
persecuting
erasmus
with
his
criticism
to
the
latter
great
vexation
at
last
there
followed
a
probably
as
erasmus
became
more
conservative
and
a
kindly
attitude
on
the
part
of
stunica
no
less
long
and
violent
was
the
quarrel
with
the
syndic
of
the
sorbonne
noel
bedier
or
beda
which
began
in
the
sorbonne
was
prevailed
upon
to
condemn
several
of
erasmus
dicta
as
heretical
in
the
effort
of
beda
to
implicate
erasmus
in
the
trial
of
louis
de
berquin
who
had
translated
the
condemned
writings
and
who
was
eventually
burned
at
the
stake
for
faith
sake
in
made
the
matter
still
more
disagreeable
for
erasmus
it
is
clear
enough
that
both
at
paris
and
at
louvain
in
the
circles
of
the
theological
faculties
the
chief
cause
of
exasperation
was
in
the
egmondanus
and
vincent
dirks
did
not
forgive
erasmus
for
having
acridly
censured
their
station
and
their
personalities
more
courteous
than
the
aforementioned
polemics
was
the
fight
with
a
italian
alberto
pio
prince
of
carpi
acrid
and
bitter

one
with
a
group
of
spanish
monks
who
brought

inquisition
to

upon
him
in
spain
was
the
name
of
those
who
inclined
to
more
liberal
conceptions
of
the
creed
in
this
way
the
matter
accumulated
for
the
volume
of
erasmus
works
which
contains
according
to
his
own
arrangement
all
his
not
but
man
that
i

they
just

erasmus

of
his
polemics

erasmus
when
the

still
seemed
to
be
the
coming
man
and
had
afterwards
besought
him
to
take

side

soon
discovered
that
this
noisy
partisan
might
compromise
him

not
one
of

satires
been
ascribed
to
him
erasmus
there
came
a
time
when

could
no

knightly
instinct

on
the
very
weaknesses
of

fear
of

inclination
to
repudiate

that

in

in

follow

this
acknowledgement
does
not
discharge
him
from
the
burden
of
reproaches
which
he
flung
at
him
in
fiery
language
in
in
this
quarrel
erasmus
own

pays
the
penalty
of
his
fault
for
nowhere
does
he
show
himself
so
undignified
and
puny
as
in

the

hutten
disillusioned
and
forsaken
died

age

not

it

at

contemplated
in
the
cause
of
peace
in

and
uniformity
of
faith
to
call
a
halt
to
the
impetuous
luther
and
thereby
to
recall
the
world
to
its
senses
in
the
great
act
of
the
reformation
their
polemics
were
merely
an
not
erasmus
alone
was
disillusioned
and
tired
luther
too
was
past
his
heroic
prime
circumscribed
by
conditions
forced
into
the
world
of
affairs
a
disappointed
man
erasmus
had
wished
to
persevere
in
his
resolution
to
remain
a
spectator
of
the
great
tragedy
as
appears
from
the
wonderful
success
of
luther
cause
god
wills
all
this
thus
did
erasmus
reason
he
has
perhaps
judged
such
a
drastic
surgeon
as
luther
necessary
for
the
corruption
of
these
times
then
it
is
not
my
business
to
withstand
him
but
he
was
not
left
in
peace
while
he
went
on
protesting
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
luther
and
differed
widely
from
him
the
defenders
of
the
old
church
adhered
to
the
standpoint
urged
as
early
as
by
nicholas
of
egmond
before
the
rector
of
louvain
long
as
he
refuses
to
write
against
luther
we
take
him
to
be
a
lutheran
so
matters
stood
you
are
looked
upon
as
a
lutheran
here
is
certain

writes
to
him
from
the
netherlands
in
ever
stronger
became
the
pressure
to
write
against
luther
from
henry
viii
came
a
call
communicated
by
erasmus
old
friend
tunstall
from
george
of
saxony
from
rome
itself
whence
pope
adrian
vi
his
old
patron
had
urged
him
shortly
before
his
death
erasmus
thought
he
could
refuse
no
longer
he
tried
some
dialogues
in
the
style
of
the
but
did
not
get
on
with
them
and
probably
they
would
not
have
pleased
those
who
were
desirous
of
enlisting
his
services
between
luther
and
erasmus
himself
there
had
been
no
personal
correspondence
since
the
former
had
promised
him
in
then
erasmus
i
shall
not
mention
your
name
again
now
that
erasmus
had
prepared
to
attack
luther
however
there
came
an
epistle
from
the
latter
written
on
april
in
which
the
reformer
in
his
turn
requested
erasmus
in
his
own
words
remain
now
what
you
have
always
professed
yourself
desirous
of
being
a
mere
spectator
of
our
tragedy
there
is
a
ring
of
ironical
contempt
in
luther
words
but
erasmus
called
the
letter
humane
i
had
not
the
courage
to
reply
with
equal
humanity
because
of
the
sycophants
in
order
to
be
able
to
combat
luther
with
a
clear
conscience
erasmus
had
naturally
to
choose
a
point
on
which
he
differed
from
luther
in
his
heart
it
was
not
one
of
the
more
superficial
parts
of
the
structure
for
these
he
either
with
luther
cordially
rejected
such
as
ceremonies
observances
fasting
or
though
more
moderately
than
luther
he
had
his
doubts
about
them
as
the
sacraments
or
the
primacy
of
peter
so
he
naturally
came
to
the
point
where
the
deepest
gulf
yawned
between
their
natures
between
their
conceptions
of
the
essence
of
faith
and
thus
to
the
central
and
eternal
problem
of
good
and
evil
guilt
and
compulsion
liberty
and
bondage
god
and
man
luther
confessed
in
his
reply
that
here
indeed
the
vital
point
had
been
touched
libero
arbitrio
disquisition
upon
free
appeared
in
september
was
erasmus
qualified
to
write
about
such
a
subject
in
conformity
with
his
method
and
with
his
evident
purpose
to
vindicate
authority
and
tradition
this
time
erasmus
developed
the
argument
that
scripture
teaches
doctors
affirm
philosophers
prove
and
human
reason
testifies
man
will
to
be
free
without
acknowledgement
of
free
will
the
terms
of
god
justice
and
god
mercy
remain
without
meaning
what
would
be
the
sense
of
the
teachings
reproofs
admonitions
of
scripture
timothy
iii
if
all
happened
according
to
mere
and
inevitable
necessity
to
what
purpose
is
obedience
praised
if
for
good
and
evil
works
we
are
equally
but
tools
to
god
as
the
hatchet
to
the
carpenter
and
if
this
were
so
it
would
be
dangerous
to
reveal
such
a
doctrine
to
the
multitude
for
morality
is
dependent
on
the
consciousness
of
freedom
luther
received
the
treatise
of
his
antagonist
with
disgust
and
contempt
in
writing
his
reply
however
he
suppressed
these
feelings
outwardly
and
observed
the
rules
of
courtesy
but
his
inward
anger
is
revealed
in
the
contents
itself
of
servo
the
will
not
for
here
he
really
did
what
erasmus
had
just
reproached
him
with
trying
to
heal
a
dislocated
member
by
tugging
at
it
in
the
opposite
direction
more
fiercely
than
ever
before
his
formidable
boorish
mind
drew
the
startling
inferences
of
his
burning
faith
without
any
reserve
he
now
accepted
all
the
extremes
of
absolute
determinism
in
order
to
confute
indeterminism
in
explicit
terms
he
was
now
forced
to
have
recourse
to
those
primitive
metaphors
of
exalted
faith
striving
to
express
the
inexpressible
god
two
wills
which
do
not
coincide
hatred
of
mankind
a
hatred
not
only
on
account
of
demerits
and
the
works
of
free
will
but
a
hatred
that
existed
even
before
the
world
was
created
and
that
metaphor
of
the
human
will
which
as
a
riding
beast
stands
in
the
middle
between
god
and
the
devil
and
which
is
mounted
by
one
or
the
other
without
being
able
to
move
towards
either
of
the
two
contending
riders
if
anywhere
luther
doctrine
in
servo
means
a
recrudescence
of
faith
and
a
straining
of
religious
conceptions
but
it
was
luther
who
here
stood
on
the
rockbed
of
a
profound
and
mystic
faith
in
which
the
absolute
conscience
of
the
eternal
pervades
all
in
him
all
conceptions
like
dry
straw
were
consumed
in
the
glow
of
majesty
for
him
each
human
to
attain
to
salvation
was
a
profanation
of
god
glory
erasmus
mind
after
all
did
not
truly
in
the
ideas
which
were
here
disputed
of
sin
and
grace
of
redemption
and
the
glory
of
god
as
the
final
cause
of
all
that
is
was
then
erasmus
cause
in
all
respects
inferior
was
luther
right
at
the
core
perhaps
murray
rightly
reminds
us
of
hegel
saying
that
tragedy
is
not
the
conflict
between
right
and
wrong
but
the
conflict
between
right
and
right
the
combat
of
luther
and
erasmus
proceeded
beyond
the
point
at
which
our
judgement
is
forced
to
halt
and
has
to
accept
an
equivalence
nay
a
compatibility
of
affirmation
and
negation
and
this
fact
that
they
here
were
fighting
with
words
and
metaphors
in
a
sphere
beyond
that
of
what
may
be
known
and
expressed
was
understood
by
erasmus
erasmus
the
man
of
the
fine
shades
for
whom
ideas
eternally
blended
into
each
other
and
interchanged
called
a
proteus
by
luther
luther
the
man
of
expression
about
all
matters
the
dutchman
who
sees
the
sea
was
opposed
to
the
german
who
looks
out
on
mountain
tops
is
quite
true
that
we
can
not
speak
of
god
but
with
inadequate
words
problems
should
be
deferred
not
to
the
oecumenical
council
but
till
the
time
when
the
glass
and
the
darkness
having
been
taken
away
we
shall
see
god
face
to
face
is
free
of
error
are
in
sacred
literature
certain
sanctuaries
into
which
god
has
not
willed
that
we
should
penetrate
further
the
catholic
church
had
on
the
point
of
free
will
reserved
to
itself
some
slight
proviso
left
a
little
to
the
consciousness
of
human
liberty
grace
erasmus
conceived
that
liberty
in
a
considerably
broader
spirit
luther
absolutely
denied
it
the
opinion
of
contemporaries
was
at
first
too
much
dominated
by
their
participation
in
the
great
struggle
as
such
they
applauded
erasmus
because
he
struck
boldly
at
luther
or
the
other
way
about
according
to
their
sympathies
not
only
vives
applauded
erasmus
but
also
more
orthodox
catholics
such
as
sadolet
the
german
humanists
unwilling
for
the
most
part
to
break
with
the
ancient
church
were
moved
by
erasmus
attack
to
turn
their
backs
still
more
upon
luther
mutianus
zasius
and
pirckheimer
even
melanchthon
inclined
to
erasmus
standpoint
others
like
capito
once
a
zealous
supporter
now
washed
their
hands
of
him
soon
calvin
with
the
iron
cogency
of
his
argument
was
completely
to
take
luther
side
it
is
worth
while
to
quote
the
opinion
of
a
contemporary
catholic
scholar
about
the
relations
of
erasmus
and
luther
says
kiefl
his
concept
of
free
unspoiled
human
nature
was
intrinsically
much
more
foreign
to
the
church
than
luther
he
only
combated
it
however
with
haughty
scepticism
for
which
reason
luther
with
subtle
psychology
upbraided
him
for
liking
to
speak
of
the
shortcomings
and
the
misery
of
the
church
of
christ
in
such
a
way
that
his
readers
could
not
help
laughing
instead
of
bringing
his
charges
with
deep
sighs
as
beseemed
before
god
the
a
voluminous
treatise
in
which
erasmus
again
addressed
luther
was
nothing
but
an
epilogue
which
need
not
be
discussed
here
at
length
erasmus
had
thus
at
last
openly
taken
sides
for
apart
from
the
dogmatical
point
at
issue
itself
the
most
important
part
about
libero
was
that
in
it
he
had
expressly
turned
against
the
individual
religious
conceptions
and
had
spoken
in
favour
of
the
authority
and
tradition
of
the
church
he
always
regarded
himself
as
a
catholic
death
nor
life
shall
draw
me
from
the
communion
of
the
catholic
church
he
writes
in
and
in
the
in
have
never
been
an
apostate
from
the
catholic
church
i
know
that
in
this
church
which
you
call
the
papist
church
there
are
many
who
displease
me
but
such
i
also
see
in
your
church
one
bears
more
easily
the
evils
to
which
one
is
accustomed
therefore
i
bear
with
this
church
until
i
shall
see
a
better
and
it
can
not
help
bearing
with
me
until
i
shall
myself
be
better
and
he
does
not
sail
badly
who
steers
a
middle
course
between
two
several
evils
but
was
it
possible
to
keep
to
that
course
on
either
side
people
turned
away
from
him
who
formerly
in
countless
letters
was
addressed
as
thrice
great
hero
prince
of
letters
sun
of
studies
maintainer
of
true
theology
am
now
ignored
or
represented
in
quite
different
colours
he
writes
how
many
of
his
old
friends
and
congenial
spirits
had
already
gone
a
sufficient
number
remained
however
who
thought
and
hoped
as
erasmus
did
his
untiring
pen
still
continued
to
propagate
especially
by
means
of
his
letters
the
moderating
and
purifying
influence
of
his
mind
throughout
all
the
countries
of
europe
scholars
high
church
dignitaries
nobles
students
and
civil
magistrates
were
his
correspondents
the
bishop
of
basle
himself
christopher
of
utenheim
was
a
man
after
erasmus
heart
a
zealous
advocate
of
humanism
he
had
attempted
as
early
as
to
reform
the
clergy
of
his
bishopric
by
means
of
synodal
statutes
without
much
success
afterwards
he
had
called
scholars
like
oecolampadius
capito
and
wimpfeling
to
basle
that
was
before
the
great
struggle
began
which
was
soon
to
carry
away
oecolampadius
and
capito
much
further
than
the
bishop
of
basle
or
erasmus
approved
in
erasmus
addressed
the
bishop
in
a
treatise
interdicto
esu
the
prohibition
of
eating
this
was
one
of
the
last
occasions
on
which
he
directly
opposed
the
established
order
the
bishop
however
could
no
longer
control
the
movement
a
considerable
number
of
the
commonalty
of
basle
and
the
majority
of
the
council
were
already
on
the
side
of
radical
reformation
about
a
year
after
erasmus
johannes
oecolampadius
whose
first
residence
at
basle
had
also
coincided
with
his
at
that
time
he
had
helped
erasmus
with
hebrew
for
the
edition
of
the
new
testament
returned
to
the
town
with
the
intention
of
organizing
the
resistance
to
the
old
order
there
in
the
council
appointed
him
professor
of
holy
scripture
in
the
university
at
the
same
time
four
catholic
professors
lost
their
places
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
general
permission
for
unlicensed
preaching
soon
a
far
more
agitator
the
impetuous
guillaume
farel
also
arrived
for
active
work
at
basle
and
in
the
environs
he
is
the
man
who
will
afterwards
reform
geneva
and
persuade
calvin
to
stay
there
though
at
first
oecolampadius
began
to
introduce
novelties
into
the
church
service
with
caution
erasmus
saw
these
innovations
with
alarm
especially
the
fanaticism
of
farel
whom
he
hated
bitterly
it
was
these
men
who
retarded
what
he
still
desired
and
thought
possible
a
compromise
his
lambent
spirit
which
never
fully
decided
in
favour
of
a
definite
opinion
had
with
regard
to
most
of
the
disputed
points
gradually
fixed
on
a
midway
standpoint
by
means
of
which
without
denying
his
deepest
conviction
he
tried
to
remain
faithful
to
the
church
in
he
had
expressed
his
sentiments
about
confession
in
the
treatise
the
way
to
he
accepts
it
halfway
if
not
instituted
by
christ
or
the
apostles
it
was
in
any
case
by
the
fathers
it
should
be
piously
preserved
confession
is
of
excellent
use
though
at
times
a
great
evil
in
this
way
he
tries
admonish
either
party
to
agree
with
nor
to
the
deniers
inclining
to
the
side
of
the
believers
in
the
long
list
of
his
polemics
he
gradually
finds
opportunities
to
define
his
views
somewhat
circumstantially
for
instance
in
the
answers
to
alberto
pio
of
and
subsequently
it
is
always
done
in
the
form
of
an
whether
he
is
attacked
for
the
for
the
jerome
the
or
anything
else
at
last
he
recapitulates
his
views
to
some
extent
in
amabili
ecclesiae
the
amiable
concord
of
the
of
which
however
ranks
hardly
any
more
among
his
reformatory
endeavours
on
most
points
erasmus
succeeds
in
finding
moderate
and
conservative
formulae
even
with
regard
to
ceremonies
he
no
longer
merely
rejects
he
finds
a
kind
word
to
say
even
for
fasting
which
he
had
always
abhorred
for
the
veneration
of
relics
and
for
church
festivals
he
does
not
want
to
abolish
the
worship
of
the
saints
it
no
longer
entails
danger
of
idolatry
he
is
even
willing
to
admit
the
images
who
takes
the
imagery
out
of
life
deprives
it
of
its
highest
pleasure
we
often
discern
more
in
images
than
we
conceive
from
the
written
word
regarding
christ
substantial
presence
in
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
he
holds
fast
to
the
catholic
view
but
without
fervour
only
on
the
ground
of
the
church
consensus
and
because
he
can
not
believe
that
christ
who
is
truth
and

would
have
suffered
his
bride
to
cling
so
long
to
so
horrid
an
error
as
to
worship
a

instead
of

but
for
these
reasons
he
might

accept

the

one
of
the
purest
and
most
beneficent

certain

betraying
old

later
follows
vidua
christian
for
mary
of
hungary
which
is
as
impeccable
but
less
interesting
all
this
did
not
disarm
the
defenders
of
the
old
church
they
held
fast
to
the
clear
picture
of
erasmus
creed
that
arose
from
the
and
that
could
not
be
called
purely
catholic
there
it
appeared
only
too
clearly
that
however
much
erasmus
might
desire
to
leave
the
letter
intact
his
heart
was
not
in
the
convictions
which
were
vital
to
the
catholic
church
consequently
the
were
later
when
erasmus
works
were
expurgated
placed
on
the
index
in
the
lump
with
the
and
a
few
other
works
the
rest
is
to
be
read
with
caution
much
was
rejected
of
the
annotations
to
the
new
testament
of
the
and
the
very
little
of
the
of
the
verae
and
even
of
the
but
this
was
after
the
fight
against
the
living
erasmus
had
long
been
over
so
long
as
he
remained
at
basle
or
elsewhere
as
the
centre
of
a
large
intellectual
group
whose
force
could
not
be
estimated
just
because
it
did
not
stand
out
as
a
party
it
was
not
known
what
turn
he
might
yet
take
what
influence
his
mind
might
yet
have
on
the
church
he
remained
a
king
of
minds
in
his
quiet
study
the
hatred
that
was
felt
for
him
the
watching
of
all
his
words
and
actions
were
of
a
nature
as
only
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
acknowledged
great
the
chorus
of
enemies
who
laid
the
fault
of
the
whole
reformation
on
erasmus
was
not
silenced
laid
the
eggs
which
luther
and
zwingli
have
hatched
with
vexation
erasmus
quoted
ever
new
specimens
of
malicious
and
stupid
controversy
at
constance
there
lived
a
doctor
who
had
hung
his
portrait
on
the
wall
merely
to
spit
at
it
as
often
as
he
passed
it
erasmus
jestingly
compares
his
fate
to
that
of
saint
cassianus
who
was
stabbed
to
death
by
his
pupils
with
pencils
had
he
not
been
pierced
to
the
quick
for
many
years
by
the
pens
and
tongues
of
countless
people
and
did
he
not
live
in
that
torment
without
death
bringing
the
end
the
keen
sensitiveness
to
opposition
was
seated
very
deeply
with
erasmus
and
he
could
never
forbear
irritating
others
into
opposing
him

erasmus
turns
against
the
excesses
of
humanism
its
paganism
and
pedantic
classicism
it
brings
him
new
enemies
the
reformation
carried
through
at
basle
he
emigrates
to
freiburg
his
view
concerning
the
results
of
the
reformation
nothing
is
more
characteristic
of
the
independence
which
erasmus
reserved
for
himself
regarding
all
movements
of
his
time
than
the
fact
that
he
also
joined
issue
in
the
camp
of
the
humanists
in
there
were
published
by
froben
the
chief
of
the
firm
of
johannes
froben
had
just
died
two
dialogues
in
one
volume
from
erasmus
hand
one
about
the
correct
pronunciation
of
latin
and
greek
and
one
entitled
or
the
best
in
writing
and
speaking
latin
both
were
proofs
that
erasmus
had
lost
nothing
of
his
liveliness
and
wit
the
former
treatise
was
purely
philological
and
as
such
has
had
great
influence
the
other
was
satirical
as
well
it
had
a
long
history
erasmus
had
always
regarded
classical
studies
as
the
panacea
of
civilization
provided
they
were
made
serviceable
to
pure
christianity
his
sincere
ethical
feeling
made
him
recoil
from
the
obscenity
of
a
poggio
and
the
immorality
of
the
early
italian
humanists
at
the
same
time
his
delicate
and
natural
taste
told
him
that
a
pedantic
and
servile
imitation
of
antique
models
could
never
produce
the
desired
result
erasmus
knew
latin
too
well
to
be
strictly
classical
his
latin
was
alive
and
required
freedom
in
his
early
works
we
find
taunts
about
the
latin
purists
one
had
declared
a
newly
found
fragment
of
cicero
to
be
thoroughly
barbaric
all
sorts
of
authors
none
are
so
insufferable
to
me
as
those
apes
of
cicero
in
spite
of
the
great
expectations
he
cherished
of
classical
studies
for
pure
christianity
he
saw
one
danger
under
the
cloak
of
reviving
ancient
literature
paganism
tries
to
rear
its
head
as
there
are
those
among
christians
who
acknowledge
christ
only
in
name
but
inwardly
breathe
heathenism
this
he
writes
in
to
capito
in
italy
scholars
devote
themselves
too
exclusively
and
in
too
pagan
guise
to
he
considered
it
his
special
task
to
assist
in
bringing
it
about
that
those
with
the
italians
have
thus
far
been
almost
pagan
shall
get
used
to
speaking
of
christ
how
it
must
have
vexed
erasmus
that
in
italy
of
all
countries
he
was
at
the
same
time
and
in
one
breath
charged
with
heresy
and
questioned
in
respect
to
his
knowledge
and
integrity
as
a
scholar
italians
accused
him
of
plagiarism
and
trickery
he
complained
of
it
to
aleander
who
he
thought
had
a
hand
in
it
in
a
letter
of
october
to
a
professor
at
toledo
we
find
the
of
the
in
addition
to
the
haters
of
classic
studies
for
the
sake
of
orthodox
belief
writes
erasmus
another
and
new
sort
of
enemies
has
broken
from
their
ambush
these
are
troubled
that
the
speak
of
christ
as
though
nothing
can
be
elegant
but
what
is
pagan
to
their
ears
optimus
sounds
more
pleasant
than
christus
redemptor
and
more
agreeable
than
they
account
it
a
greater
dishonour
to
be
no
ciceronian
than
no
christian
as
if
cicero
if
he
should
now
come
to
life
again
would
not
speak
of
christian
things
in
other
words
than
in
his
time
he
spoke
of
his
own
religion
what
is
the
sense
of
this
hateful
swaggering
with
the
name
ciceronian
i
will
tell
you
briefly
in
your
ear
with
that
they
cover
the
paganism
that
is
dearer
to
them
than
the
glory
of
christ
to
erasmus
cicero
style
is
by
no
means
the
ideal
one
he
prefers
something
more
solid
succinct
vigorous
less
polished
more
manly
he
who
sometimes
has
to
write
a
book
in
a
day
has
no
time
to
polish
his
style
often
not
even
to
read
it
over
do
i
care
for
an
empty
dish
of
words
ten
words
here
and
there
mumped
from
cicero
i
want
all
cicero
spirit
these
are
apes
at
whom
one
may
laugh
for
far
more
serious
than
these
things
are
the
tumults
of
the
new
gospel
to
which
he
next
proceeds
in
this
letter
and
so
in
the
midst
of
all
his
polemics
and
bitter
vindication
he
allowed
himself
once
more
the
pleasure
of
giving
the
reins
to
his
love
of
scoffing
but
as
in
the
and
ennobled
by
an
almost
passionate
sincerity
of
christian
disposition
and
a
natural
sense
of
measure
the
is
a
masterpiece
of
ready
knowledge
of
convincing
eloquence
and
of
easy
handling
of
a
wealth
of
arguments
with
splendid
quiet
and
yet
lively
breadth
flows
the
long
conversation
between
bulephorus
representing
erasmus
opinions
hypologus
the
interested
inquirer
and
nosoponus
the
zealous
ciceronian
who
to
preserve
a
perfect
purity
of
mind
breakfasts
off
ten
currants
erasmus
in
drawing
nosoponus
had
evidently
in
the
main
alluded
to
one
who
could
no
longer
reply
christopher
longolius
who
had
died
in
the
core
of
the
is
where
erasmus
points
out
the
danger
to
christian
faith
of
a
too
zealous
classicism
he
exclaims
urgently
is
paganism
believe
me
nosoponus
it
is
paganism
that
charms
our
ear
and
our
soul
in
such
things
we
are
christians
in
name
alone
why
does
a
classic
proverb
sound
better
to
us
than
a
quotation
from
the
bible
inter
among
the
vegetables
better
than
among
the
prophets
as
a
sample
of
the
absurdity
of
ciceronianism
he
gives
a
translation
of
a
dogmatic
sentence
in
classical
language
maximique

ac
filius
servator
rex
juxta

the
word
and
the
son
of
the
eternal
father
came
into
the
world
according
to
the
prophets
most
humanists
wrote
indeed
in
that
style
was
erasmus
aware
that
he
here
attacked
his
own
past
after
all
was
it
not
exactly
the
same
thing
which
he
had
done
to
the
indignation
of
his
opponents
when
translating
by
instead
of
by
had
he
not
himself
desired
that
in
the
church
hymns
the
metre
should
be
corrected
not
to
mention
his
own
classical
odes
and
paeans
to
mary
and
the
saints
and
was
his
warning
against
the
partiality
for
classic
proverbs
and
turns
applicable
to
anything
more
than
to
the
we
here
see
the
aged
erasmus
on
the
path
of
reaction
which
might
eventually
have
led
him
far
from
humanism
in
his
combat
with
humanistic
purism
he
foreshadows
a
christian
puritanism
as
always
his
mockery
procured
him
a
new
flood
of
invectives
bembo
and
sadolet
the
masters
of
pure
latin
could
afford
to
smile
at
it
but
the
impetuous
julius
caesar
scaliger
violently
inveighed
against
him
especially
to
avenge
longolius
memory
erasmus
perpetual
feeling
of
being
persecuted
got
fresh
food
he
again
thought
that
aleander
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
italians
set
the
imperial
court
against
me
he
writes
in
a
year
later
all
is
quiet
again
he
writes
jestingly
my
word
i
am
going
to
change
my
style
after
budaeus
model
and
to
become
a
ciceronian
according
to
the
example
of
sadolet
and
bembo
but
even
near
the
close
of
his
life
he
was
engaged
in
a
new
contest
with
italians
because
he
had
hurt
their
national
pride
rage
at
me
on
all
sides
with
slanderous
libels
as
at
the
enemy
of
italy
and
cicero
there
were
as
he
had
said
himself
other
difficulties
touching
him
more
closely
conditions
at
basle
had
for
years
been
developing
in
a
direction
which
distressed
and
alarmed
him
when
he
established
himself
there
in
it
might
still
have
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
bishop
old
christopher
of
utenheim
a
great
admirer
of
erasmus
and
a
man
after
his
heart
would
succeed
in
effecting
a
reformation
at
basle
as
he
desired
it
abolishing
acknowledged
abuses
but
remaining
within
the
fold
of
the
church
in
that
very
year
however
the
emancipation
of
the
municipality
from
the
bishop
power
it
had
been
in
progress
since
basle
in
had
joined
the
swiss
confederacy
was
consummated
henceforth
the
council
was
number
one
now
no
longer
exclusively
made
up
of
aristocratic
elements
in
vain
did
the
bishop
ally
himself
with
his
colleagues
of
constance
and
lausanne
to
maintain
catholicism
in
the
town
the
new
creed
got
more
and
more
the
upper
hand
when
however
in
it
had
come
to
open
tumults
against
the
catholic
service
the
council
became
more
cautious
and
tried
to
reform
more
heedfully
oecolampadius
desired
this
too
relations
between
him
and
erasmus
were
precarious
erasmus
himself
had
at
one
time
directed
the
religious
thought
of
the
impulsive
sensitive
restless
young
man
when
he
had
in
suddenly
sought
refuge
in
a
convent
he
had
expressly
justified
that
step
towards
erasmus
the
condemner
of
binding
vows
and
now
they
saw
each
other
again
at
basle
in
oecolampadius
having
left
the
monastery
a
convinced
adherent
and
apostle
of
the
new
doctrine
erasmus
the
great
spectator
which
he
wished
to
be
erasmus
treated
his
old
coadjutor
coolly
and
as
the
latter
progressed
retreated
more
and
more
yet
he
kept
steering
a
middle
course
and
in
gave
some
moderate
advice
to
the
council
which
meanwhile
had
turned
more
catholic
again
the
old
bishop
who
for
some
years
had
no
longer
resided
in
his
town
in
requested
the
chapter
to
relieve
him
of
his
office
and
died
shortly
afterwards
then
events
moved
very
quickly
after
berne
had
meanwhile
reformed
itself
in
oecolampadius
demanded
a
decision
also
for
basle
since
the
close
of
the
town
had
been
on
the
verge
of
civil
war
a
popular
rising
put
an
end
to
the
resistance
of
the
council
and
cleared
it
of
catholic
members
and
in
february
the
old
service
was
prohibited
the
images
were
removed
from
the
churches
the
convents
abolished
and
the
university
suspended
oecolampadius
became
the
first
minister
in
the
and
leader
of
the
basle
church
for
which
he
soon
drew
up
a
reformatory
ordinance
the
new
bishop
remained
at
porrentruy
and
the
chapter
removed

freiburg

xxiii
erasmus
residence
at
freiburg
the
moment
of
departure
had
now
come
for
erasmus
his
position
at
basle
in
somewhat
resembled
but
in
a
reversed
sense
the
one
at
louvain
in
then
the
catholics
wanted
to
avail
themselves
of
his
services
against
luther
now
the
evangelicals
would
fain
have
kept
him
at
basle
for
his
name
was
still
as
a
banner
his
presence
would
strengthen
the
position
of
reformed
basle
on
the
one
hand
because
as
people
reasoned
if
he
were
not
of
the
same
mind
as
the
reformers
he
would
have
left
the
town
long
ago
on
the
other
hand
because
his
figure
seemed
to
guarantee
moderation
and
might
attract
many
hesitating
minds
it
was
therefore
again
to
safeguard
his
independence
that
erasmus
changed
his
residence
it
was
a
great
wrench
this
time
old
age
and
invalidism
had
made
the
restless
man
a
as
he
foresaw
trouble
from
the
side
of
the
municipality
he
asked
archduke
ferdinand
who
for
his
brother
charles
v
governed
the
german
empire
and
just
then
presided
over
the
diet
of
speyer
to
send
him
a
safe
conduct
for
the
whole
empire
and
an
invitation
moreover
to
come
to
court
which
he
did
not
dream
of
accepting
as
place
of
refuge
he
had
selected
the
not
far
distant
town
of
freiburg
im
breisgau
which
was
directly
under
the
strict
government
of
the
austrian
house
and
where
he
therefore
need
not
be
afraid
of
such
a
turn
of
affairs
as
that
at
basle
it
was
moreover
a
juncture
at
which
the
imperial
authority
and
the
catholic
cause
in
germany
seemed
again
to
be
gaining
ground
rapidly
erasmus
would
not
or
could
not
keep
his
departure
a
secret
he
sent
the
most
precious
of
his
possessions
in
advance
and
when
this
had
drawn
attention
to
his
plan
he
purposely
invited
oecolampadius
to
a
farewell
talk
the
reformer
declared
his
sincere
friendship
for
erasmus
which
the
latter
did
not
decline
provided
he
granted
him
to
differ
on
certain
points
of
dogma
oecolampadius
tried
to
keep
him
from
leaving
the
town
and
when
it
proved
too
late
for
that
to
persuade
him
to
return
later
they
took
leave
with
a
handshake
erasmus
had
desired
to
join
his
boat
at
a
distant
but
the
council
would
not
allow
this
he
had
to
start
from
the
usual
place
near
the
rhine
bridge
a
numerous
crowd
witnessed
his
embarkation
april
some
friends
were
there
to
see
him
off
no
unfavourable
demonstration
occurred
his
reception
at
freiburg
convinced
him
that
in
spite
of
all
he
was
still
the
celebrated
and
admired
prince
of
letters
the
council
placed
at
his
disposal
the
large
though
unfinished
house
built
for
the
emperor
maximilian
himself

professor
of

his

anthony
fugger
had
tried
to
draw
him
to
augsburg
by
means
of
a
yearly
allowance
for
the
rest
he
considered
freiburg
by
no
means
a
permanent
place
of
abode

resolved
to
remain
here
this
winter
and
then
to
fly
with
the
swallows
to
the
place
whither
god
shall
call
me
but
he
soon
recognized
the
great
advantage
which
freiburg
offered
the
climate
to
which
he
was
so
sensitive
turned
out
better
than
he
expected
and
the
position
of
the
town
was
extremely
favourable
for
emigrating
to
france
should
circumstances
require
this

for
dropping
down

many
always

bought
a
house
at
freiburg
the
old
erasmus
at
freiburg
ever
more
tormented
by
his
painful
malady
much
more
disillusioned
than
when
he
left
louvain
in
of
more
confirmed
views
as
to
the
great
ecclesiastical
strife
will
only
be
fully
revealed
to
us
when
his
correspondence
with
boniface
amerbach
the
friend
whom
he
left
behind
at
basle
a
correspondence
not
found
complete
in
the
older
collections
has
been
edited
by
allen
care
from
no
period
of
erasmus
life
it
seems
may
so
much
be
gleaned
in
point
of
knowledge
of
his
daily
habits
and
thoughts
as
from
these
very
years
work
went
on
without
a
break
in
that
great
scholar
workshop
where
he
directs
his
famuli
who
hunt
manuscripts
for
him
and
then
copy
and
examine
them
and
whence
he
sends
forth
his
letters
all
over
europe
in
the
series
of
editions
of
the
fathers
followed
basil
and
new
editions
of
chrysostom
and
cyprian
his
editions
of
classic
authors
were
augmented
by
the
works
of
aristotle
he
revised
and
republished
the
three
more
times
the
and
the
new
testament
once
more
occasional
writings
of
a
moral
or
nature
kept
flowing
from
his
pen
from
the
cause
of
the
reformation
he
was
now
quite
estranged
he
contumeliously
calls
the
reformed
might
have
been
a
corypheus
in
luther
church
he
writes
in
i
preferred
to
incur
the
hatred
of
all
germany
to
being
separate
from
the
community
of
the
church
the
authorities
should
have
paid
a
little
less
attention
at
first
to
luther
proceedings
then
the
fire
would
never
have
spread
so
violently
he
had
always
urged
theologians
to
let
minor
concerns
which
only
contain
an
appearance
of
piety
rest
and
to
turn
to
the
sources
of
scripture
now
it
was
too
late
towns
and
countries
united
ever
more
closely
for
or
against
the
reformation
what
i
pray
may
never
happen
he
writes
to
sadolet
in
should
see
horrible
commotions
of
the
world
arise
not
so
fatal
for
germany
as
for
the
church
then
remember
erasmus
prophesied
it
to
beatus
rhenanus
he
frequently
said
that
had
he
known
that
an
age
like
theirs
was
coming
he
would
never
have
written
many
things
or
would
not
have
written
them
as
he
had
look
he
exclaims
the
evangelical
people
have
they
become
any
better
do
they
yield
less
to
luxury
lust
and
greed
show
me
a
man
whom
that
gospel
has
changed
from
a
toper
to
a
temperate
man
from
a
brute
to
a
gentle
creature
from
a
miser
into
a
liberal
person
from
a
shameless
to
a
chaste
being
i
will
show
you
many
who
have
become
even
worse
than
they
were
now
they
have
thrown
the
images
out
of
the
churches
and
abolished
mass
he
is
thinking
of
basle
especially
has
anything
better
come
instead
have
never
entered
their
churches
but
i
have
seen
them
return
from
hearing
the
sermon
as
if
inspired
by
an
evil
spirit
the
faces
of
all
showing
a
curious
wrath
and
ferocity
and
there
was
no
one
except
one
old
man
who
saluted
me
properly
when
i
passed
in
the
company
of
some
distinguished
persons
he
hated
that
spirit
of
absolute
assuredness
so
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
reformers
and
bucer
may
be
inspired
by
the
spirit
erasmus
from
himself
is
nothing
but
a
man
and
can
not
comprehend
what
is
of
the
spirit
there
was
a
group
among
the
reformed
to
whom
erasmus
in
his
heart
of
hearts
was
more
nearly
akin
than
to
the
lutherans
or
zwinglians
with
their
rigid
dogmatism
the
anabaptists
he
rejected
the
doctrine
from
which
they
derived
their
name
and
abhorred
the
anarchic
element
in
them
he
remained
far
too
much
the
man
of
spiritual
decorum
to
identify
himself
with
these
irregular
believers
but
he
was
not
blind
to
the
sincerity
of
their
moral
aspirations
and
sympathized
with
their
dislike
of
brute
force
and
the
patience
with
which
they
bore
persecution
are
praised
more
than
all
others
for
the
innocence
of
their
life
he
writes
in
just
in
the
last
part
of
his
life
came
the
episode
of
the
violent
revolutionary
proceedings
of
the
fanatic
anabaptists
it
goes
without
saying
that
erasmus
speaks
of
it
only
with
horror
one
of
the
best
historians
of
the
reformation
walter
köhler
calls
erasmus
one
of
the
spiritual
fathers
of
anabaptism
and
certain
it
is
that
in
its
later
peaceful
development
it
has
important
traits
in
common
with
erasmus
a
tendency
to
acknowledge
free
will
a
certain
rationalistic
trend
a
dislike
of
an
exclusive
conception
of
a
church
it
seems
possible
to
prove
that
the
south
german
anabaptist
hans
denk
derived
opinions
directly
from
erasmus
for
a
considerable
part
however
this
community
of
ideas
must
no
doubt
have
been
based
on
peculiarities
of
religious
consciousness
in
the
netherlands
whence
erasmus
sprang
and
where
anabaptism
found
such
a
receptive
soil
erasmus
was
certainly
never
aware
of
these
connections
some
remarkable
evidence
regarding
erasmus
altered
attitude
towards
the
old
and
the
new
church
is
shown
by
what
follows
the
reproach
he
had
formerly
so
often
flung
at
the
advocates
of
conservatism
that
they
hated
the
so
dear
to
him
and
wanted
to
stifle
them
he
now
uses
against
the
evangelical
party
lutherism
is
dominant
the
study
of
literature
is
extinguished
why
else
he
continues
using
a
remarkable
sophism
luther
and
melanchthon

call
back
the
people

urgently

during

life
all
the
great
issues
which
kept
the
world
in
suspense
were
rapidly
taking
threatening
forms
wherever
compromise
or
reunion
had
before
still
seemed
possible
sharp
conflicts
clearly
outlined
binding
formulae
were
now
barring
the
way
to

while
in
the
spring
of
erasmus
prepared
for
his
departure
from
basle
a
strong
catholic
majority
of
the
diet
at
speyer
got
the
of
favourable
for
the
evangelicals
revoked
only
the
lutherans
among
them
keeping
what
they
had
obtained
and
secured
a
prohibition
of
any
further
changes
or
novelties
the
zwinglians
and
anabaptists
were
not
allowed
to
enjoy
the
least
tolerance
this
was
immediately
followed
by
the
protest
of
the
chief
evangelical
princes
and
towns
which
henceforth
was
to
give
the
name
to
all
together
april
and
not
only
between
catholics
and
protestants
in
the
empire
did
the
rupture
become
complete
even
before
the
end
of
that
year
the
question
of
the
lord
supper
proved
an
insuperable
in
the
way
of

between

and

calmed
for
a
short
time
by
the
first
peace
of
kappel
the
treaties
of
cambray
and
barcelona
which
in
restored
at
least
political
peace
in
christendom
for
the
time
being
could
no
longer
draw
from
old
erasmus
jubilations
about
a
coming
golden
age
like
those
with
which
the
concord
of
had
inspired
him
a
month
later
the
turks
appeared
before
vienna
all
these
occurrences
could
not
but
distress
and
alarm
erasmus
but
he
was
outside
them
when
reading
his
letters
of
that
period
we
are
more
than
ever
impressed
by
the
fact
that
for
all
the
width
and
liveliness
of
his
mind
he
is
remote
from
the
great
happenings
of
his
time
beyond
a
certain
circle
of
interests
touching
his
own
ideas
or
his
person
his
perceptions
are
vague
and
weak
if
he
still
meddles
occasionally
with
questions
of
the
day
he
does
so
in
the
moralizing
manner
by
means
of
generalities
without
emphasis
his
about
declaring
war
on
the
turks
march
is
written
in
the
form
of
an
interpretation
of
psalm
and
so
vague
that
at
the
close
he
himself
anticipates
that
the
reader
may
exclaim
now
say
clearly
do
you
think
that
war
should
be
declared
or
not
in
the
summer
of
the
diet
met
again
at
augsburg
under
the
auspices
of
the
emperor
himself
to
try
once
more
attain
to
a
good
peace
and
christian
truth
the
augsburg
confession
defended
all
too
weakly
by
melanchthon
was
read
here
disputed
and
declared
refuted
by
the
emperor
erasmus
had
no
share
in
all
this
many
had
exhorted
him
in
letters
to
come
to
augsburg
but
he
had
in
vain
expected
a
summons
from
the
emperor
at
the
instance
of
the
emperor
counsellors
he
had
postponed
his
proposed
removal
to
brabant
in
that
autumn
till
after
the
decision
of
the
diet
but
his
services
were
not
needed
for
the
drastic
resolution
of
repression
with
which
the
emperor
closed
the
session
in
november
the
great
struggle
in
germany
seemed
to
be
approaching
the
resolutions
of
augsburg
were
followed
by
the
formation
of
the
league
of
schmalkalden
uniting
all
protestant
territories
and
towns
of
germany
in
their
opposition
to
the
emperor
in
the
same
year
zwingli
was
killed
in
the
battle
of
kappel
against
the
catholic
cantons
soon
to
be
followed
by
oecolampadius
who
died
at
basle
is
right
writes
erasmus
those
two
leaders
have
perished
if
mars
had
been
favourable
to
them
we
should
now
have
been
done
for
in
switzerland
a
sort
of
equilibrium
had
set
in
at
any
rate
matters
had
come
to
a
standstill
in
germany
the
inevitable
struggle
was
postponed
for
many
years
the
emperor
had
understood
that
to
combat
the
german
protestants
effectively
he
should
first
get
the
pope
to
hold
the
council
which
would
abolish
the
acknowledged
abuses
of
the
church
the
religious
peace
of
nuremberg
put
the
seal
upon
this
turn
of
imperial
policy
it
might
seem
as
if
before
long
the
advocates
of
moderate
reform
and
of
a
compromise
might
after
all
get
a
chance
of
being
heard
but
erasmus
had
become
too
old
to
actively
participate
in
the
decisions
if
he
had
ever
seriously
considered
such
participation
he
does
write
a
treatise
though
in
the
sweet
concord
of
the
church
like
his
on
the
turks
in
the
form
of
an
interpretation
of
a
psalm
but
it
would
seem
as
if
the
old
vivacity
of
his
style
and
his
power
of
expression
so
long
unimpaired
now
began
to
flag
the
same
remark
applies
to
an
essay
the
preparation
for
death
published
the
same
year
his
voice
was
growing
weaker
during
these
years
he
turned
his
attention
chiefly
to
the
completion
of
the
great
work
which
more
than
any
other
represented
for
him
the
summing
up
and
complete
exposition
of
his
ideas
or
the
way
to
erasmus
had
always
regarded
preaching
as
the
most
dignified
part
of
an
ecclesiastic
duties
as
preachers
he
had
most
highly
valued
colet
and
vitrarius
as
early
as
his
friend
john
becar
of
borselen
urged
him
to
follow
up
the
of
the
christian
soldier
and
the
of
the
christian
prince
by
the
true
instruction
of
the
christian
preacher
later
erasmus
had
promised
him
present
i
have
too
much
work
but
i
hope
to
undertake
it
soon
in
he
had
already
made
a
sketch
and
some
notes
for
it
it
was
meant
for
john
fisher
the
bishop
of
rochester
erasmus
great
friend
and
who
eagerly
looked
forward
to
it
and
urged
the
author
to
finish
it
the
work
gradually
grew
into
the
most
voluminous
of
erasmus
original
writings
a
forest
of
a
work
he
calls
it
himself
in
four
books
he
treated
his
subject
the
art
of
preaching
well
and
decorously
with
an
inexhaustible
abundance
of
examples
illustrations
schemes
etc
but
was
it
possible
that
a
work
conceived
already
by
the
erasmus
of
and
upon
which
he
had
been
so
long
engaged
while
he
himself
had
gradually
given
up
the
boldness
of
his
earlier
years
could
still
be
a
revelation
in
as
the
had
been
in
its
day
is
the
work
of
a
mind
fatigued
which
no
longer
sharply
reacts
upon
the
needs
of
his
time
as
the
result
of
a
correct
intellectual
tasteful
instruction
in
a
suitable
manner
of
preaching
in
accordance
with
the
purity
of
the
gospel
erasmus
expects
to
see
society
improve
people
become
more
obedient
to
the
authorities
more
respectful
towards
the
law
more
peaceable
between
husband
and
wife
comes
greater
concord
more
perfect
faithfulness
greater
dislike
of
adultery
servants
obey
more
willingly
artisans
work
better
merchants
cheat
no
more
at
the
same
time
that
erasmus
took
this
work
to
froben
at
basle
to
print
a
book
of
a
young
frenchman
who
had
recently
fled
from
france
to
basle
passed
through
the
press
of
another
basle
printer
thomas
platter
it
too
was
to
be
a
manual
of
the
life
of
faith
the
of
the
christian
by
calvin
even
before
erasmus
had
quite
completed
the
the
man
for
whom
the
work
had
been
meant
was
no
more
instead
of
to
the
bishop
of
rochester
erasmus
dedicated
his
voluminous
work
to
the
bishop
of
augsburg
christopher
of
stadion
john
fisher
to
set
a
seal
on
his
spiritual
endeavours
resembling
those
of
erasmus
in
so
many
respects
had
left
behind
as
a
testimony
to
the
world
for
which
erasmus
knew
himself
too
weak
that
of
martyrdom
on
june
he
was
beheaded
by
command
of
henry
viii
he
died
for
being
faithful
to
the
old
church
together
with
more
he
had
steadfastly
refused
to
take
the
oath
to
the
statute
of
supremacy
not
two
weeks
after
fisher
thomas
more
mounted
the
scaffold
the
fate
of
those
two
noblest
of
his
friends
grieved
erasmus
it
moved
him
to
do
what
for
years
he
had
no
longer
done
to
write
a
poem
but
rather
than
in
the
fine
latin
measure
of
that
one
would
have
liked
to
hear
his
emotion
in
language
of
sincere
dismay
and
indignation
in
his
letters
they
are
hardly
there
in
the
words
devoted
to
fisher
death
in
the
preface
to
the
there
is
no
heartfelt
emotion
also
in
his
letters
of
those
days
he
speaks
with
reserve
more
had
never
meddled
with
that
dangerous
business
and
left
the
theological
cause
to
the
theologians
as
if
more
had
died
for
aught
but
simply
for
his
conscience
when
erasmus
wrote
these
words
he
was
no
longer
at
freiburg
he
had
in
june
gone
to
basle
to
work
in
froben
as
of
old
the
was
at
last
going
to
press
and
still
required
careful
supervision
and
the
final
touches
during
the
process
the
had
to
be
reprinted
and
a
latin
edition
of
origenes
was
in
preparation
the
old
sick
man
was
cordially
received
by
the
many
friends
who
still
lived
at
basle
hieronymus
froben
johannes
son
who
after
his
death
managed
the
business
with
two
relatives
sheltered
him
in
his
house
in
the
hope
of
his
return
a
room
had
been
built
expressly
for
him
and
fitted
up
as
was
convenient
for
him
erasmus
found
that
at
basle
the
ecclesiastical
storms
which
had
formerly
driven
him
away
had
subsided
quiet
and
order
had
returned
he
did
feel
a
spirit
of
distrust
in
the
air
it
is
true
i
think
that
on
account
of
my
age
of
habit
and
of
what
little
erudition
i
possess
i
have
now
got
so
far
that
i
may
live
in
safety
anywhere
at
first
he
had
regarded
the
removal
as
an
experiment
he
did
not
mean
to
stay
at
basle
if
his
health
could
not
stand
the
change
of
air
he
would
return
to
his
fine
comfortable
house
at

louvain

to

your
accusers
and

your

erasmus
in
years
of
greater
strength
have
seen
his
way
to
actively
in
the
council
of
the

undoubtedly
the
exhortation
correctly
represented
his
inclination
but
once
faced
by
the
necessity
of
hard
clear
resolutions
what
would
he
have
effected
would
his
spirit
of
peace
and
toleration
of
reserve
and
compromise
have
brought
alleviation
and
warded
off
the
coming
struggle
he
was
spared
the
experiment
he
knew
himself
too
weak
to
be
able
to
think
of
strenuous
propaganda
any
more
soon
there
came
proofs
that
the
kindly
feelings
at
rome
were
sincere
there
had
been
some
question
also
of
numbering
erasmus
among
the
cardinals
who
were
to
be
nominated
with
a
view
to
the
council
a
considerable
benefice
connected
with
the
church
of
deventer
was
already
offered
him
but
erasmus
urged
the
roman
friends
who
were
thus
active
in
his
behalf
to
cease
their
kind
offices
he
would
accept
nothing
he
a
man
who
lived
from
day
to
day
in
expectation
of
death
and
often
hoping
for
it
who
could
hardly
ever
leave
his
room
would
people
instigate
to
hunt
for
deaneries
and
hats
he
had
subsistence
enough
to
last
him
he
wanted
to
die
independent
yet
his
pen
did
not
rest
the

been
printed
and
published
and
was
still
to
follow
instead
of
the
important
and
brilliant
task
to
which
rome
called
him
he
devoted
his
last
strength
to
a
simple
deed
of
friendly
cordiality
the
friend
to
whose
share
the
honour
fell
to
receive
from
the
old
author
a
last
composition
prepared
expressly
for
him
amidst
the
most
terrible
pains
was
the
most
modest
of
the
number
who
had
not
lost
their
faith
in
him
no
prelate
or

no

wit
or

but
christopher
eschenfelder
customs
officer
at
boppard
on
the
rhine
on
his
passage
in

had
with
glad
surprise
found
him
to
be
a
reader
of
his
work
and
a
man
of
culture
that
friendship
had
been
a
lasting
one
eschenfelder
had
asked
erasmus
to
dedicate
the
interpretation
of
some
psalm
to
him
a
form
of
composition
often
preferred
by
erasmus
of
late
about
the
close
of

remembered
that
request
he
had
forgotten
whether
eschenfelder
had
indicated
a
particular
psalm
and
chose
one
at
haphazard
psalm
calling
the
treatise
the
purity
of
the
christian
church
he
expressly
dedicated
it
to
publican
in
january
it
is
not
remarkable
among
his
writings
as
to
contents
and
form
but
it
was
to
be
his
last
on
february
erasmus
made
his
final
preparations
in

had
already
made
a
will
with
detailed
clauses
for
the
printing
of
his
complete
works

the

in

looking
back
on
the
life
of
erasmus
the
question
still
arises
why
has
he
remained
so
great
for
ostensibly
his
endeavours
ended
in
failure
he
withdraws
in
alarm
from
that
tremendous
struggle
which
he
rightly
calls
a
tragedy
the
sixteenth
century
bold
and
vehement
thunders
past
him
disdaining
his
ideal
of
moderation
and
tolerance
latin
literary
erudition
which
to
him
was
the
epitome
of
all
true
culture
has
gone
out
as
such
erasmus
so
far
as
regards
the
greater
part
of
his
writings
is
among
the
great
ones
who
are
no
longer
read
he
has
become
a
name
but
why
does
that
name
still
sound
so
clear
and
articulate
why
does
he
keep
regarding
us
as
if
he
still
knew
a
little
more
than
he
has
ever
been
willing
to
utter
what
has
he
been
to
his
age
and
what
was
he
to
be
for
later
generations
has
he
been
rightly
called
a
precursor
of
the
modern
spirit
regarded
as
a
child
of
the
sixteenth
century
he
does
seem
to
differ
from
the
general
tenor
of
his
times
among
those
vehemently
passionate
drastically
energetic
and
violent
natures
of
the
great
ones
of
his
day
erasmus
stands
as
the
man
of
too
few
prejudices
with
a
little
too
much
delicacy
of
taste
with
a
deficiency
though
not
indeed
in
every
department
of
that
which
he
had
praised
as
a
necessary
constituent
of
life
erasmus
is
the
man
who
is
too
sensible
and
moderate
for
the
heroic
what
a
surprising
difference
there
is
between
the
of
erasmus
and
that
of
luther
calvin
and
saint
teresa
what
a
difference
also
between
his
accent
that
is
the
accent
of
humanism
and
that
of
albrecht
dürer
of
michelangelo
or
of
shakespeare
erasmus
seems
at
times
the
man
who
was
not
strong
enough
for
his
age
in
that
robust
sixteenth
century
it
seems
as
if
the
oaken
strength
of
luther
was
necessary
the
steely
edge
of
calvin
the
white
heat
of
loyola
not
the
velvet
softness
of
erasmus
not
only
were
their
force
and
their
fervour
necessary
but
also
their
depth
their
unsparing
undaunted
consistency
sincerity
and
outspokenness
they
can
not
bear
that
smile
which
makes
luther
speak
of
the
guileful
being
looking
out
of
erasmus
features
his
piety
is
too
even
for
them
too
limp
loyola
has
testified
that
the
reading
of
the
militis
relaxed
his
fervour
and
made
his
devotion
grow
cold
he
saw
that
warrior
of
christ
differently
in
the
glowing
colours
of
the
medieval
ideal
of
chivalry
erasmus
had
never
passed
through
those
depths
of
and
that
consciousness
of
sin
which
luther
had
traversed
with
toil
he
saw
no
devil
to
fight
with
and
tears
were
not
familiar
to
him
was
he
altogether
unaware
of
the
deepest
mystery
or
did
it
rest
in
him
too
deep
for
utterance
let
us
not
suppose
too
quickly
that
we
are
more
nearly
allied
to
luther
or
loyola
because
their
figures
appeal
to
us
more
if
at
present
our
admiration
goes
out
again
to
the
ardently
pious
and
to
spiritual
extremes
it
is
partly
because
our
unstable
time
requires
strong
stimuli
to
appreciate
erasmus
we
should
begin
by
giving
up
our
admiration
of
the
extravagant
and
for
many
this
requires
a
certain
effort
at
present
it
is
extremely
easy
to
break
the
staff
over
erasmus
his
faults
lie
on
the
surface
and
though
he
wished
to
hide
many
things
he
never
hid
his
weaknesses
he
was
too
much
concerned
about
what
people
thought
and
he
could
not
hold
his
tongue
his
mind
was
rich
and
facile
always
suggesting
a
superfluity
of
arguments
cases
examples
quotations
he
could
never
let
things
slide
all
his
life
he
grudged
himself
leisure
to
rest
and
collect
himself
to
see
how
unimportant
after
all
was
the
commotion
round
about
him
if
only
he
went
his
own
way
courageously
rest
and
independence
he
desired
most
ardently
of
all
things
there
was
no
more
restless
and
dependent
creature
judge
him
as
one
of
a
too
delicate
constitution
who
ventures
out
in
a
storm
his
was
great
enough
he
worked
night
and
day
amidst
the
most
violent
bodily
suffering
with
a
great
ideal
steadfastly
before
him
never
satisfied
with
his
own
achievements
he
was
not
as
an
intellectual
type
erasmus
was
one
of
a
rather
small
group
the
absolute
idealists
who
at
the
same
time
are
thoroughly
moderate
they
can
not
bear
the
world
imperfections
they
feel
constrained
to
oppose
but
extremes
are
uncongenial
to
them
they
shrink
back
from
action
because
they
know
it
pulls
down
as
much
as
it
erects
and
so
they
withdraw
themselves
and
keep
calling
that
everything
should
be
different
but
when
the
crisis
comes
they
reluctantly
side
with
tradition
and
conservatism
here
too
is
a
fragment
of
he
was
the
man
who
saw
the
new
and
coming
things
more
clearly
than
anyone
else
who
must
needs
quarrel
with
the
old
and
yet
could
not
accept
the
new
he
tried
to
remain
in
the
fold
of
the
old
church
after
having
damaged
it
seriously
and
renounced
the
reformation
and
to
a
certain
extent
even
humanism
after
having
furthered
both
with
all
his
strength

final
opinion

erasmus

qualities
so
far
what
was
his
positive
importance
two
facts
make
it
difficult
for
the
modern
mind
to
understand
positive
importance
first
that
his
influence
was
extensive
rather
than
intensive
and
therefore
less
historically
discernible
at
definite
points
and
second
that
his
influence
has
ceased
he
has
done
his
work
and
will
speak
to
the
world
no
more
like
saint
jerome
his
revered
model
and
voltaire
with
whom
he
has
been
occasionally
compared
has
his
reward

like
them
he
has

the

organ
of
human
expression
as
rousseau
was

do

and
love
him
from
his
books
he
was
glad
that
his
translations
from
the
greek
had
become
superfluous
he
had
everywhere
led
many
to
take
up
greek
and
holy
scripture
otherwise
they
would
never
have
read
he
had
been
an
introducer
and
an
initiator
he
might
leave
the
stage
after
having
said
his
say
his
word
signified
something
beyond
a
classical
sense
and
biblical
disposition
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
first
enunciation
of
the
creed
of
education
and
perfectibility
of
warm
social
feeling
and
of
faith
in
human
nature
of
peaceful
kindliness
and
toleration
dwells
everywhere
piety
is
practised
under
every
garment
if
only
a
kindly
disposition
is
not
wanting
in
all
these
ideas
and
convictions
erasmus
really
heralds
a
later
age
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
those
thoughts
remained
an
undercurrent
in
the
eighteenth
erasmus
message
of
deliverance
bore
fruit
in
this
respect
he
has
most
certainly
been
a
precursor
and
preparer
of
the
modern
mind
of
rousseau
herder
pestalozzi
and
of
the
english
and
american
thinkers
it
is
only
part
of
the
modern
mind
which
is
represented
by
all
this
to
a
number
of
its
developments
erasmus
was
wholly
a
stranger
to
the
evolution
of
natural
science
of
the
newer
philosophy
of
political
economy
but
in
so
far
as
people
still
believe
in
the
ideal
that
moral
education
and
general
tolerance
may
make
humanity
happier
humanity
owes
much
to
erasmus
this
does
not
imply
that
erasmus
mind
did
not
directly
and
fruitfully
influence
his
own
times
although
catholics
regarded
him
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
as
the
corrupter
of
the
church
and
protestants
as
the
betrayer
of
the
gospel
yet
his
word
of
moderation
and
kindliness
did
not
pass
by
unheard
or
unheeded
on
either
side
eventually
neither
camp
finally
rejected
erasmus
rome
did
not
brand
him
as
an
but
only
warned
the
faithful
to
read
him
with
caution
protestant
history
has
been
studious
to
reckon
him
as
one
of
the
reformers
both
obeyed
in
this
the
pronouncement
of
a
public
opinion
which
was
above
parties
and
which
continued
to
admire
and
revere
erasmus
to
the
reconstruction
of
the
catholic
church
and
the
erection
of
the
evangelical
churches
not
only
the
names
of
luther
and
loyola
are
linked
the
moderate
the
intellectual
the
conciliating
have
also
had
their
share
of
the
work
figures
like
melanchthon
here
sadolet
there
both
nearly
allied
to
erasmus
and
sympathetically
disposed
towards
him
the
frequently
repeated
attempts
to
arrive
at
some
compromise
in
the
great
religious
conflict
though
they
might
be
doomed
to
end
in
failure
emanated
from
the
erasmian
spirit
nowhere
did
that
spirit
take
root
so
easily
as
in
the
country
that
gave
erasmus
birth
a
curious
detail
shows
us
that
it
was
not
the
exclusive
privilege
of
either
great
party
of
his
two
most
favoured
pupils
of
later
years
both
netherlanders
whom
as
the
actors
of
the
colloquy
game
of
he
has
immortalized
together
the
one
quirin
talesius
died
for
his
attachment
to
the
spanish
cause
and
the
catholic
faith
he
was
hanged
in
by
the
citizens
of
haarlem
where
he
was
a
burgomaster
the
other
charles
utenhove
was
sedulous
on
the
side
of
the
revolt
and
the
reformed
religion
at
ghent
in
concert
with
the
prince
of
orange
he
turned
against
the
protestant
terrorism
of
the
zealots
a
dutch
historian
recently
tried
to
trace
back
the
opposition
of
the
dutch
against
the
king
of
spain
to
the
influence
of
erasmus
political
thought
in
his
arraignment
of
bad
princes
wrongly
as
i
think
political
diatribes
were
far
too
academic
and
too
general
for
that
the
desire
of
resistance
and
revolt
arose
from
quite
other
causes
the
were
not
erasmus
progeny
but
there
is
much
that
is
erasmian
in
the
spirit
of
their
great
leader
william
of
orange
whose
vision
ranged
so
widely
beyond
the
limitations
of
religious
hatred
thoroughly
permeated
by
the
erasmian
spirit
too
was
that
class
of
municipal
magistrates
who
were
soon
to
take
the
lead
and
to
set
the
fashion
in
the
established
republic
history
is
wont
as
always
with
an
aristocracy
to
take
their
faults
very
seriously
after
all
perhaps
no
other
aristocracy
unless
it
be
that
of
venice
has
ruled
a
state
so
long
so
well
and
with
so
little
violence
if
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
institutions
of
holland
in
the
eyes
of
foreigners
were
the
admired
models
of
prosperity
charity
and
social
discipline
and
patterns
of
gentleness
and
wisdom
however
defective
they
may
seem
to
us
then
the
honour
of
all
this
is
due
to
the
municipal
aristocracy
if
in
the
dutch
patriciate
of
that
time
those
aspirations
lived
and
were
translated
into
action
it
was
erasmus
spirit
of
social
responsibility
which
inspired
them
the
history
of
holland
is
far
less
bloody
and
cruel
than
that
of
any
of
the
surrounding
countries
not
for
naught
did
erasmus
praise
as
truly
dutch
those
qualities
which
we
might
also
call
truly
erasmian
gentleness
kindliness
moderation
a
generally
diffused
moderate
erudition
not
romantic
virtues
if
you
like
but
are
they
the
less
salutary
one
more
instance
in
the
republic
of
the
seven
provinces
the
atrocious
executions
of
witches
and
wizards
ceased
more
than
a
century
before
they
did
in
all
other
countries
this
was
not
owing
to
the
merit
of
the
reformed
pastors
they
shared
the
popular
belief
which
demanded
persecution
it
was
the
magistrates
whose
enlightenment
even
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
no
longer
tolerated
these
things
again
we
are
entitled
to
say
though
erasmus
was
not
one
of
those
who
combated
this
practice
the
spirit
which
breathes
from
this
is
that
of
erasmus
cultured
humanity
has
cause
to
hold
erasmus
memory
in
esteem
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
the
fervently
sincere
preacher
of
that
general
kindliness
which
the
world
still
so
urgently
needs
selection
from
the
letters
of
erasmus
selection
from
the
vast
correspondence
of
erasmus
is
intended
to
exhibit
him
at
a
few
points
in
his
strenuous
and
rather
comfortless
life
always
overworked
often
ill
and
perpetually
hurried
many
of
his
letters
have
the
postscript
haste
or
had
no
time
to
read
this
over
but
holding
always
tenaciously
to
his
aim
of
steering
a
middle
course
in
religion
between
the
corruption
and
fossilization
of
the
old
and
the
uncompromising
violence
of
the
new
in
learning
between
on
the
one
hand
and
the
indolent
refusal
under
the
pretext
of
piety
to
apply
critical
methods
to
sacred
texts
on
the
other
the
first
letter
has
been
included
because
it
may
provide
a
clue
to
his
later
reluctance
to
trust
his
feelings
when
to
any
cause
seemed
to
be
required
of
him
a
reluctance
not
unnaturally
interpreted
by
his
enemies
as
an
arrogant
refusal
to
to
notes
have
been
compiled
from
and
opus
epistolarum
des
erasmi
roterodami
by
the
kind
permission
of
the

to
his

servatius
greetings
you
say
there
is
something
which
you
take
very
hard
which
torments
you
wretchedly
which
in
short
makes
life
a
misery
to
you
your
looks
and
your
carriage
betray
this
even
if
you
were
silent
where
is
your
wonted
and
beloved
cheerful
countenance
gone
your
former
beauty
your
lively
glance
whence
come
these
sorrowful
downcast
eyes
whence
this
perpetual
silence
so
unlike
you
whence
the
look
of
a
sick
man
in
your
expression
assuredly
as
the
poet
says
sick
body
betrays
the
torments
of
the
lurking
soul
likewise
its
joys
it
is
to
the
mind
that
the
face
owes
its
looks
well
or
ill
it
is
certain
then
my
servatius
that
there
is
something
which
troubles
you
which
is
destroying
your
former
good
health
but
what
am
i
to
do
now
must
i
comfort
you
or
scold
you
why
do
you
hide
your
pain
from
me
as
if
we
did
not
know
each
other
by
this
time
you
are
so
deep
that
you
do
not
believe
your
closest
friend
or
trust
even
the
most
trustworthy
or
do
you
not
know
that
the
hidden
fire
burns
stronger
and
for
the
rest
my
servatius
what
is
it
makes
you
draw
in
and
hide
yourself
like
a
snail
i
suspect
what
the
matter
is
you
have
not
yet
convinced
yourself
that
i
love
you
very
much
so
i
entreat
you
by
the
things
sweetest
to
you
in
life
by
our
great
love
if
you
have
any
care
for
your
safety
if
you
want
me
to
live
unharmed
not
to
be
at
such
pains
to
hide
your
feelings
but
whatever
it
is
entrust
it
to
my
safe
ears
i
will
assist
you
in
whatever
way
i
can
with
help
or
counsel
but
if
i
can
not
provide
either
still
it
will
be
sweet
to
rejoice
with
you
to
weep
with
you
to
live
and
die
with
you
farewell
my
servatius
and
look
after
your
health
ii
to
nicholas
werner
paris
september
to
the
religious
father
nicholas
werner
greetings
if
you
are
all
well
there
things
are
as
i
wish
and
hope
i
myself
am
very
well
the
gods
be
thanked
i
have
now
made
clear
by
my
actions
if
it
was
not
clear
to
anyone
before
this
how
much
theology
is
coming
to
mean
to
me
a
somewhat
arrogant
claim
but
it
ill
becomes
erasmus
to
hide
anything
from
his
most
loving
father
lately
i
had
fallen
in
with
certain
englishmen
of
noble
birth
and
all
of
them
wealthy
very
recently
i
was
approached
by
a
young
priest
very
rich
who
said
he
had
refused
a
bishopric
offered
him
as
he
knew
that
he
was
not
well
educated
nevertheless
he
is
to
be
recalled
by
the
king
to
take
a
bishopric
within
a
year
although
apart
from
any
bishopric
even
he
has
a
yearly
income
of
more
than
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
my
learning
he
proceeded
in
unbelievably
affectionate
fashion
to
devote
himself
to
me
to
frequent
and
revere
me
he
lived
for
a
while
in
my
house
he
offered
if
i
would
teach
him
for
a
year
he
offered
a
benefice
in
a
few
months
time
he
offered
to
lend
me
if
i
should
need
them
to
procure
the
office
until
i
could
pay
them
back
out
of
the
benefice
by
this
service
i
could
have
laid
all
the
english
in
this
city
under
an
obligation
to
me
they
are
all
of
the
first
families
and
through
them
all
england
had
i
so
wished
but
i
cared
nothing
for
the
splendid
income
and
the
far
more
splendid
prospects
i
cared
nothing
for
their
entreaties
and
the
tears
which
accompanied
them
i
am
telling
the
truth
exaggerating
not
at
all
the
english
realize
that
the
money
of
all
england
means
nothing
to
me
this
refusal
which
i
still
maintain
was
not
made
without
due
consideration
not
for
any
reward
will
i
let
myself
be
drawn
away
from
theological
studies
i
did
not
come
here
to
teach
or
to
pile
up
gold
but
to
learn
indeed
i
shall
seek
a
doctorate
in
theology
if
the
gods
so
will
it
the
bishop
of
cambrai
is
marvellously
fond
of
me
he
makes
liberal
promises
the
remittances
are
not
so
liberal
to
tell
the
truth
i
wish
you
good
health
excellent
father
i
beg
and
entreat
you
to
commend
me
in
your
prayers
to
god
i
shall
do
likewise
for
you
from
my
library
in
paris
iii
to
robert
fisher
london
december
to
robert
fisher
englishman
abiding
in
italy
greetings
i
hesitated
not
a
little
to
write
to
you
beloved
robert
not
that
i
feared
lest
so
great
a
sunderance
in
time
and
place
had
worn
away
anything
of
your
affection
towards
me
but
because
you
are
in
a
country
where
even
the
are
more
learned
and
more
eloquent
than
are
our
men
here
so
that
what
is
here
reckoned
polished
fine
and
delectable
can
not
there
appear
anything
but
crude
mean
and
insipid
wherefore
your
england
assuredly
expects
you
to
return
not
merely
very
learned
in
the
law
but
also
equally
eloquent
in
both
the
greek
and
the
latin
tongues
you
would
have
seen
me
also
there
long
since
had
not
my
friend
mountjoy
carried
me
off
to
his
country
when
i
was
already
packed
for
the
journey
into
italy
whither
indeed
shall
i
not
follow
a
youth
so
polite
so
kindly
so
lovable
i
swear
i
would
follow
him
even
into
hades
you
indeed
had
most
handsomely
commended
him
and
in
a
word
precisely
delineated
him
but
believe
me
he
every
day
surpasses
both
your
commendation
and
my
opinion
of
him
but
you
ask
how
england
pleases
me
if
you
have
any
confidence
in
me
dear
robert
i
would
have
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
never
yet
liked
anything
so
well
i
have
found
here
a
climate
as
delightful
as
it
is
wholesome
and
moreover
so
much
humane
learning
not
of
the
outworn
commonplace
sort
but
the
profound
accurate
ancient
greek
and
latin
learning
that
i
now
scarcely
miss
italy
but
for
the
sight
of
it
when
i
listen
to
my
friend
colet
i
seem
to
hear
plato
himself
who
would
not
marvel
at
the
perfection
of
encyclopaedic
learning
in
grocyn
what
could
be
keener
or
nobler
or
nicer
than
linacre
judgement
what
has
nature
ever
fashioned
gentler
or
sweeter
or
happier
than
the
character
of
thomas
more
but
why
should
i
catalogue
the
rest
it
is
marvellous
how
thick
upon
the
ground
the
harvest
of
ancient
literature
is
here
everywhere
flowering
forth
all
the
more
should
you
hasten
your
return
hither
your
friend
affection
and
remembrance
of
you
is
so
strong
that
he
speaks
of
none
so
often
or
so
gladly
farewell
written
in
haste
in
london
on
the
of
december
iv
to
james
batt
orléans
december
if
you
care
sincerely
what
becomes
of
your
erasmus
do
you
act
thus
plead
my
shyness
before
my
lady
in
pleasant
phrases
as
if
i
had
not
been
able
to
bring
myself
to
reveal
my
poverty
to
her
in
person
but
you
must
write
that
i
am
now
in
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
owing
to
the
great
expense
of
this
flight
to
orléans
as
i
had
to
leave
people
from
whom
i
was
making
some
money
tell
her
that
italy
is
by
far
the
most
suitable
place
in
which
to
take
the
degree
of
doctor
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
fastidious
man
to
go
to
italy
without
a
large
sum
of
money
particularly
because
i
am
not
even
at
liberty
to
live
meanly
on
account
of
my
reputation
such
as
it
is
for
learning
you
will
explain
how
much
greater
fame
i
am
likely
to
bring
my
lady
by
my
learning
than
are
the
other
theologians
maintained
by
her
they
compose
commonplace
harangues
i
write
works
destined
to
live
for
ever
their
ignorant
triflings
are
heard
by
one
or
two
persons
in
church
my
books
will
be
read
by
latins
greeks
by
every
race
all
over
the
world
tell
her
that
this
kind
of
unlearned
theologian
is
to
be
found
in
hordes
everywhere
whereas
a
man
like
myself
is
hardly
to
be
found
once
in
many
centuries
unless
indeed
you
are
so
superstitious
that
you
scruple
to
employ
a
few
harmless
lies
to
help
a
friend
then
you
must
point
out
that
she
will
not
be
a
whit
the
poorer
if
with
a
few
gold
pieces
she
helps
to
restore
the
corrupt
text
of
jerome
and
the
true
theology
when
so
much
of
her
wealth
is
being
shamelessly
dissipated
after
dilating
on
this
with
your
customary
ingenuity
and
writing
at
length
on
my
character
my
expectations
my
affection
for
my
lady
and
my
shyness
you
must
then
add
that
i
have
written
to
say
that
i
need
francs
in
all
and
request
her
to
grant
me
next
year
payment
now
i
am
not
inventing
this
my
dear
batt
to
go
to
italy
with
francs
no
less
than
francs
seems
to
me
a
hazardous
enterprise
unless
i
want
to
enslave
myself
to
someone
once
more
may
i
die
before
i
do
this
then
how
little
difference
it
will
make
to
her
whether
she
gives
me
the
money
this
year
or
next
and
how
much
it
means
to
me
next
urge
her
to
look
out
for
a
benefice
for
me
so
that
on
my
return
i
may
have
some
place
where
i
can
pursue
learning
in
peace
do
not
stop
at
this
but
devise
on
your
own
the
most
convenient
method
of
indicating
to
her
that
she
should
promise
me
before
all
the
other
candidates
at
least
a
reasonable
if
not
a
splendid
benefice
which
i
can
change
as
soon
as
a
better
one
appears
i
am
well
aware
that
there
are
many
candidates
for
benefices
but
you
must
say
that
i
am
the
one
man
whom
compared
with
the
rest
etc
you
know
your
old
way
of
lying
profusely
about
erasmus
you
will
add
at
the
end
that
i
have
made
the
same
complaint
in
my
letter
which
jerome
makes
more
than
once
in
his
letters
that
study
is
tearing
my
eyes
out
that
things
look
as
if
i
shall
have
to
follow
his
example
and
begin
to
study
with
my
ears
and
tongue
only
and
persuade
her
in
the
most
amusing
words
at
your
command
to
send
me
some
sapphire
or
other
gem
wherewith
to
fortify
my
eyesight
i
would
have
told
you
myself
which
gems
have
this
virtue
but
i
have
not
pliny
at
hand
get
the
information
out
of
your
doctor
let
me
tell
you
what
else
i
want
you
to
attempt
still
further
to
extract
a
grant
from
the
abbot
you
know
him
invent
some
modest
and
persuasive
argument
for
making
this
request
tell
him
that
i
have
a
great
design
in
hand
to
constitute
in
its
entirety
the
text
of
jerome
which
has
been
corrupted
mutilated
and
thrown
into
disorder
through
the
ignorance
of
the
theologians
i
have
detected
many
false
and
spurious
pieces
among
his
writings
and
to
restore
the
greek
i
shall
reveal
in
him
an
ingenuity
and
a
knowledge
of
antiquities
which
no
one
i
venture
to
claim
has
yet
realized
explain
that
for
this
undertaking
many
books
are
needed
also
greek
works
so
that
i
may
receive
a
grant
here
you
will
not
be
lying
batt
i
am
wholly
engaged
on
this
work
farewell
my
best
and
dearest
batt
and
put
all
of
batt
into
this
business
i
mean

abbot
of
bertin
greetings
i
have
accidentally
happened
upon
some
greek
books
and
am
busy
day
and
night
secretly
copying
them
out
i
shall
be
asked
why
i
am
so
delighted
with
cato
the
censor
example
that
i
want
to
turn
greek
at
my
age
indeed
most
excellent
father
if
in
my
boyhood
i
had
been
of
this
mind
or
rather
if
time
had
not
been
wanting
i
should
be
the
happiest
of
men
as
things
are
i
think
it
better
to
learn
even
if
a
little
late
than
not
to
know
things
which
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
have
at
one
command
i
have
already
tasted
of
greek
literature
in
the
past
but
merely
as
the
saying
goes
sipped
at
it
however
having
lately
gone
a
little
deeper
into
it
i
perceive
as
one
has
often
read
in
the
best
authorities
that
latin
learning
rich
as
it
is
is
defective
and
incomplete
without
greek
for
we
have
but
a
few
small
streams
and
muddy
puddles
while
they
have
pure
springs
and
rivers
rolling
gold
i
see
that
it
is
utter
madness
even
to
touch
the
branch
of
theology
which
deals
chiefly
with
the
mysteries
unless
one
is
also
provided
with
the
equipment
of
greek
as
the
translators
of
the
scriptures
owing
to
their
conscientious
scruples
render
greek
forms
in
such
a
fashion
that
not
even
the
primary
sense
what
our
theologians
call
the
sense
can
be
understood
by
persons
ignorant
of
greek
who
could
understand
the
sentence
in
the
psalm
ps
peccatum
meum
contra
me
est
unless
he
has
read
the
greek
this
runs
as
follows
greek
kai
hê
hamartia
mou
enôpion
mou
esti
diapantos
at
this
point
some
theologian
will
spin
a
long
story
of
how
the
flesh
is
perpetually
in
conflict
with
the
spirit
having
been
misled
by
the
double
meaning
of
the
preposition
that
is
when
the
word
greek
enôpion
refers
not
to
but
to
as
if
you
were
to
say
so
that
the
meaning
was
that
his
fault
was
so
hateful
to
him
that
the
memory
of
it
never
left
him
but
floated
always
before
his
mind
as
if
it
were
present
further
in
a
passage
elsewhere
ps
patientes
erunt
ut
everyone
will
be
misled
by
the
deceptive
form
unless
he
has
learned
from
the
greek
that
just
as
according
to
latin
usage
we
say
of
those
who
good
someone
so
the
greeks
call
greek
eupathountas
those
who
good
to
be
done
so
that
the
sense
is
will
be
well
treated
and
will
be
helped
by
my
benefactions
so
that
they
will
make
mention
of
my
beneficence
towards
them
but
why
do
i
pick
out
a
few
trifling
examples
from
so
many
important
ones
when
i
have
on
my
side
the
venerable
authority
of
the
papal
curia
there
is
a
curial
decree
still
extant
in
the
decretals
ordaining
that
persons
should
be
appointed
in
the
chief
academies
as
they
were
then
capable
of
giving
accurate
instruction
in
hebrew
greek
and
latin
literature
since
as
they
believed
the
scriptures
could
not
be
understood
far
less
discussed
without
this
knowledge
this
most
sound
and
most
holy
decree
we
so
far
neglect
that
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
most
elementary
knowledge
of
the
latin
language
being
apparently
convinced
that
everything
can
be
extracted
from
duns
scotus
as
it
were
from
a
cornucopia
for
myself
i
do
not
fight
with
men
of
this
sort
each
man
to
his
taste
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
let
the
old
man
marry
the
old
woman
it
is
my
delight
to
set
foot
on
the
path
into
which
jerome
and
the
splendid
host
of
so
many
ancients
summon
me
so
help
me
god
i
would
sooner
be
mad
with
them
than
as
sane
as
you
like
with
the
mob
of
modern
theologians
besides
i
am
attempting
an
arduous
and
so
to
say
phaethontean
task
to
do
my
best
to
restore
the
works
of
jerome
which
have
been
partly
corrupted
by
those
persons
and
are
partly
owing
to
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
antiquities
and
of
greek
literature
forgotten
or
mangled
or
mutilated
or
at
least
full
of
mistakes
and
monstrosities
not
merely
to
restore
them
but
to
elucidate
them
with
commentaries
so
that
each
reader
will
acknowledge
to
himself
that
the
great
jerome
considered
by
the
ecclesiastical
world
as
the
most
perfect
in
both
branches
of
learning
the
sacred
and
the
profane
can
indeed
be
read
by
all
but
can
only
be
understood
by
the
most
learned
as
i
am
working
hard
on
this
design
and
see
that
i
must
in
the
first
place
acquire
greek
i
have
decided
to
study
for
some
months
under
a
greek
teacher
a
real
greek
no
twice
a
greek
always
hungry
who
charges
an
immoderate
fee
for
his
lessons

primate
of
england
many
greetings
from
erasmus
of
rotterdam
canon
of
the
order
of
augustine
having
made
up
my
mind
most
illustrious
prelate
to
translate
the
greek
authors
and
by
so
doing
to
revive
or
if
you
will
promote
as
far
as
i
could
theological
studies
and
god
immortal
how
miserably
they
have
been
corrupted
by
sophistical
nonsensicalities
i
did
not
wish
to
give
the
impression
that
i
was
attempting
forthwith
to
learn
the
potter
art
on
a
winejar
as
the
greek
adage
goes
and
rushing
in
with
unwashen
feet
as
they
say
on
so
vast
an
undertaking
so
i
decided
to
begin
by
testing
how
far
i
had
profited
by
my
studies
in
both
languages
and
that
in
a
material
difficult
indeed
but
not
sacred
so
that
the
difficulty
of
the
undertaking
might
be
useful
for
practice
and
at
the
same
time
if
i
made
any
mistakes
these
mistakes
should
involve
only
the
risk
of
my
talent
and
leave
the
holy
scriptures
undamaged
and
so
i
endeavoured
to
render
in
latin
two
tragedies
of
euripides
the
and
the
in
in
the
hope
that
perchance
some
god
might
favour
so
bold
a
venture
with
fair
breezes
then
seeing
that
a
specimen
of
the
work
begun
found
favour
with
persons
excellently
well
versed
in
both
tongues
assuredly
england
by
now
possesses
several
of
these
if
i
may
acknowledge
the
truth
without
envy
men
deserving
of
the
admiration
even
of
all
italy
in
any
branch
of
learning
i
brought
the
work
to
a
finish
with
the
good
help
of
the
muses
within
a
few
short
months
at
what
a
cost
in
exertion
those
will
best
feel
who
enter
the
same
lists
why
so
because
the
mere
task
of
putting
real
greek
into
real
latin
is
such
that
it
requires
an
extraordinary
artist
and
not
only
a
man
with
a
rich
store
of
scholarship
in
both
languages
at
his
fingertips
but
one
exceedingly
alert
and
observant
so
that
for
several
centuries
now
none
has
appeared
whose
efforts
in
this
field
were
unanimously
approved
by
scholars
it
is
surely
easy
then
to
conjecture
what
a
heavy
task
it
has
proved
to
render
verse
in
verse
particularly
verse
so
varied
and
unfamiliar
and
to
do
this
from
a
writer
not
merely
so
remote
in
time
and
withal
a
tragedian
but
also
marvellously
concise
taut
and
unadorned
in
whom
there
is
nothing
otiose
nothing
which
it
would
not
be
a
crime
to
alter
or
remove
and
besides
one
who
treats
rhetorical
topics
so
frequently
and
so
acutely
that
he
appears
to
be
everywhere
declaiming
add
to
all
this
the
choruses
which
through
i
know
not
what
striving
after
effect
are
so
obscure
that
they
need
not
so
much
a
translator
as
an
oedipus
or
priest
of
apollo
to
interpret
them
in
addition
there
is
the
corrupt
state
of
the
manuscripts
the
dearth
of
copies
the
absence
of
any
translators
to
whom
one
can
have
recourse
so
i
am
not
so
much
surprised
that
even
in
this
most
prolific
age
none
of
the
italians
has
ventured
to
attempt
the
task
of
translating
any
tragedy
or
comedy
whereas
many
have
set
their
hand
to
homer
among
these
even
politian
failed
to
satisfy
himself
one
man
has
essayed
hesiod
and
that
without
much
success
another
has
attempted
theocritus
but
with
even
far
more
unfortunate
results
and
finally
francesco
filelfo
has
translated
the
first
scene
of
the
hecuba
in
one
of
his
funeral
orations
i
first
learned
this
after
i
had
begun
my
version
but
in
such
a
way
that
great
as
he
is
his
work
gave
me
courage
enough
to
proceed
overprecise
as
i
am
in
other
respects
then
for
me
the
lure
of
this
poet
more
than
honeyed
eloquence
which
even
his
enemies
allow
him
proved
stronger
than
the
deterrent
of
these
great
examples
and
the
many
difficulties
of
the
work
so
that
i
have
been
bold
to
attack
a
task
never
before
attempted
in
the
hope
that
even
if
i
failed
my
honest
readers
would
consider
even
this
poor
effort
of
mine
not
altogether
unpraiseworthy
and
the
more
grudging
would
at
least
be
lenient
to
an
inexperienced
translator
of
a
work
so
difficult
in
particular
because
i
have
deliberately
added
no
light
burden
to
my
other
difficulties
through
my
conscientiousness
as
a
translator
in
attempting
so
far
as
possible
to
reproduce
the
shape
and
as
it
were
contours
of
the
greek
verse
by
striving
to
render
line
for
line
and
almost
word
for
word
and
everywhere
seeking
with
the
utmost
fidelity
to
convey
to
latin
ears
the
force
and
value
of
the
sentence
whether
it
be
that
i
do
not
altogether
approve
of
the
freedom
in
translation
which
cicero
allows
others
and
practised
himself
i
would
almost
say
to
an
immoderate
degree
or
that
as
an
inexperienced
translator
i
preferred
to
err
on
the
side
of
seeming
rather
than
hesitating
on
the
sandy
shore
instead
of
wrecking
my
ship
and
swimming
in
the
midst
of
the
billows
and
i
preferred
to
run
the
risk
of
letting
scholars
complain
of
lack
of
brilliance
and
poetic
beauty
in
my
work
rather
than
of
lack
of
fidelity
to
the
original
finally
i
did
not
want
to
set
myself
up
as
a
paraphraser
thus
securing
myself
that
retreat
which
many
use
to
cloak
their
ignorance
wrapping
themselves
like
the
in
darkness
of
their
own
making
to
avoid
detection
now
if
readers
do
not
find
here
the
grandiloquence
of
latin
tragedy
bombast
and
the
words
half
a
yard
long
as
horace
calls
it
they
must
not
blame
me
if
in
performing
my
function
of
translator
i
have
preferred
to
reproduce
the
concise
simplicity
and
elegance
of
my
original
and
not
the
bombast
to
which
he
is
a
stranger
and
which
i
do
not
greatly
admire
at
any
time
furthermore
i
am
encouraged
to
hope
with
all
certainty
that
these
labours
of
mine
will
be
most
excellently
protected
against
the
calumnies
of
the
unjust
as
their
publication
will
be
most
welcome
to
the
honest
and
just
if
you
most
excellent
father
have
voted
them
your
approval
for
me
it
was
not
difficult
to
select
you
from
the
great
host
of
illustrious
and
distinguished
men
to
be
the
recipient
of
this
product
of
my
vigils
as
the
one
man
i
have
observed
to
be
aside
from
the
brilliance
of
your
fortune
so
endowed
adorned
and
showered
with
learning
eloquence
good
sense
piety
modesty
integrity
and
lastly
with
an
extraordinary
liberality
towards
those
who
cultivate
good
letters
that
the
word
primate
suits
none
better
than
yourself
who
hold
the
first
place
not
solely
by
reason
of
your
official
dignity
but
far
more
because
of
all
your
virtues
while
at
the
same
time
you
are
the
principal
ornament
of
the
court
and
the
sole
head
of
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
if
i
have
the
fortune
to
win
for
this
my
work
the
commendation
of
a
man
so
highly
commended
i
shall
assuredly
not
repent
of
the
exertions
i
have
so
far
expended
and
will
be
forward
to
promote
theological
studies
with
even
more
zeal
for
the
future
farewell
and

bologna

to

manutius
of

many
greetings
i
have
often
wished
most
learned
manutius
that
the
light
you
have
cast
on
greek
and
latin
literature
not
by
your
printing
alone
and
your
splendid
types
but
by
your
brilliance
and
your
uncommon
learning
could
have
been
matched
by
the
profit
you
in
your
turn
drew
from
them
so
far
as
is
concerned
the
name
of
aldus
manutius
will
without
doubt
be
on
the
lips
of
all
devotees
of
sacred
literature
unto
all
posterity
and
your
memory
will
be
as
your
fame
now
is
not
merely
illustrious
but
loved
and
cherished
as
well
because
you
are
engaged
as
i
hear
in
reviving
and
disseminating
the
good
authors
with
extreme
diligence
but
not
at
a
commensurate
profit
undergoing
truly
herculean
labours
labours
splendid
indeed
and
destined
to
bring
you
immortal
glory
but
meanwhile
more
profitable
to
others
than
to
yourself
i
hear
that
you
are
printing
plato
in
greek
types
very
many
scholars
eagerly
await
the
book
i
should
like
to
know
what
medical
authors
you
have
printed
i
wish
you
would
give
us
paul
of
aegina
i
wonder
what
has
prevented
you
from
publishing
the
new
testament
long
since
a
work
which
would
delight
even
the
common
people
if
i
conjecture
aright
but
particularly
my
own
class
the
theologians
i
send
you
two
tragedies
which
i
have
been
bold
enough
to
translate
whether
with
success
you
yourself
shall
judge
thomas
linacre
william
grocyn
william
latimer
cuthbert
tunstall
friends
of
yours
as
well
as
of
mine
thought
highly
of
them
you
know
yourself
that
they
are
too
learned
to
be
deceived
in
their
judgement
and
too
sincere
to
want
to
flatter
a
friend
unless
their
affection
for
me
has
somewhat
blinded
them
the
italians
to
whom
i
have
so
far
shown
my
attempt
do
not
condemn
it
it
has
been
printed
by
badius
successfully
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
so
he
writes
for
he
has
now
sold
all
the
copies
to
his
satisfaction
but
my
reputation
has
not
been
enhanced
thereby
so
full
is
it
all
of
mistakes
and
in
fact
he
offers
his
services
to
repair
the
first
edition
by
printing
a
second
but
i
am
afraid
of
his
mending
ill
with
ill
as
the
sophoclean
saying
goes
i
should
consider
my
labours
to
have
been
immortalized
if
they
could
come
out
printed
in
your
types
particularly
the
smaller
types
the
most
beautiful
of
all
this
will
result
in
the
volume
being
very
small
and
the
business
being
concluded
at
little
expense
if
you
think
it
convenient
to
undertake
the
affair
i
will
supply
you
with
a
corrected
copy
which
i
send
by
the
bearer
except
that
you
may
wish
to
send
me
a
few
volumes
as
gifts
for
my
friends
i
should
not
have
hesitated
to
attempt
the
publication
at
my
own
risk
and
expense
were
it
not
that
i
have
to
leave
italy
within
a
few
months
so
i
should
much
like
to
have
the
business
concluded
as
soon
as
possible
in
fact
it
is
hardly
ten
days
work
if
you
insist
on
my
taking
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
volumes
though
the
god
of
gain
does
not
usually
favour
me
and
it
will
be
most
inconvenient
to
transport
the
package
i
shall
not
refuse
if
only
you
fix
a
horse
as
the
price
farewell
most
learned
aldus
and
reckon
erasmus
as
one
of
your
if
you
have
any
rare
authors
in
your
press
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
indicate
this
my
learned
british
friends
have
asked
me
to
search
for
them
if
you
decide
not
to
print
the
will
you
return
the
copy
to
the
bearer
to
bring
back

me
viii
to
thomas
more
paris
june
to
his
friend
thomas
more
greetings
in
days
gone
by
on
my
journey
back
from
italy
into
england
in
order
not
to
waste
all
the
time
that
must
needs
be
spent
on
horseback
in
dull
and
unlettered
gossiping
i
preferred
at
times
either
to
turn
over
in
my
mind
some
topic
of
our
common
studies
or
to
give
myself
over
to
the
pleasing
recollection
of
the
friends
as
learned
as
they
are
beloved
whom
i
had
left
behind
me
in
england
you
were
among
the
very
first
of
these
to
spring
to
mind
my
dear
more
indeed
i
used
to
enjoy
the
memory
of
you
in
absence
even
as
i
was
wont
to
delight
in
your
present
company
than
which
i
swear
i
never
in
my
life
met
anything
sweeter
therefore
since
i
thought
that
i
must
at
all
hazards
do
and
that
time
seemed
ill
suited
to
serious
meditation
i
determined
to
amuse
myself
with
the
of
you
will
ask
what
goddess
put
this
into
my
mind
in
the
first
place
it
was
your
family
name
of
more
which
comes
as
near
to
the
word
folly
as
you
yourself
are
far
from
the
reality
everyone
agrees
that
you
are
far
removed
from
it
next
i
suspected
that
you
above
all
would
approve
this
of
mine
in
that
you
yourself
do
greatly
delight
in
jests
of
this
kind
that
is
jests
learned
if
i
mistake
not
and
at
no
time
insipid
and
altogether
like
to
play
in
some
sort
the
democritus
in
the
life
of
society
although
you
indeed
owing
to
your
incredibly
sweet
and
character
are
both
able
and
glad
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
even
as
your
singularly
penetrating
intellect
causes
you
to
dissent
widely
from
the
opinions
of
the
herd
so
you
will
not
only
gladly
accept
this
little
declamation
as
a
memento
of
your
comrade
but
will
also
take
it
under
your
protection
inasmuch
as
it
is
dedicated
to
you
and
is
now
no
longer
mine
but
yours
and
indeed
there
will
perhaps
be
no
lack
of
brawlers
to
represent
that
trifles
are
more
frivolous
than
becomes
a
theologian
or
more
mordant
than
suits
with
christian
modesty
and
they
will
be
crying
out
that
i
am
reviving
the
old
comedy
or
lucian
and
assailing
everything
with
biting
satire
but
i
would
have
those
who
are
offended
by
the
levity
and
sportiveness
of
my
theme
reflect
that
it
was
not
i
that
began
this
but
that
the
same
was
practised
by
great
writers
in
former
times
seeing
that
so
many
centuries
ago
homer
made
his
trifle
battle
of
frogs
and
virgil
his
and
of
and
ovid
his
seeing
that
busiris
was
praised
by
polycrates
and
his
critic
isocrates
injustice
by
glaucon
thersites
and
the
quartan
fever
by
favorinus
baldness
by
synesius
the
fly
and
the
art
of
being
a
parasite
by
lucian
and
that
seneca
devised
the
apotheosis
of
the
emperor
claudius
plutarch
the
dialogue
of
gryllus
and
ulysses
lucian
and
apuleius
the
ass
and
someone
unknown
the
testament
of
grunnius
corocotta
the
piglet
mentioned
even
by
jerome
so
if
they
will
let
my
detractors
imagine
that
i
have
played
an
occasional
game
of
draughts
for
a
pastime
or
if
they
prefer
taken
a
ride
on
a
how
unfair
it
is
truly
when
we
grant
every
calling
in
life
its
amusements
not
to
allow
the
profession
of
learning
any
amusement
at
all
particularly
if
triflings
bring
serious
thoughts
in
their
train
and
frivolous
matters
are
so
treated
that
a
reader
not
altogether
devoid
of
perception
wins
more
profit
from
these
than
from
the
glittering
and
portentous
arguments
of
certain
persons
as
when
for
instance
one
man
eulogizes
rhetoric
or
philosophy
in
a
painfully
oration
another
rehearses
the
praises
of
some
prince
another
urges
us
to
begin
a
war
with
the
turks
another
foretells
the
future
and
another
proposes
a
new
method
of
splitting
hairs
just
as
there
is
nothing
so
trifling
as
to
treat
serious
matters
triflingly
so
there
is
nothing
so
delightful
as
to
treat
trifling
matters
in
such
fashion
that
it
appears
that
you
have
been
doing
anything
but
trifle
as
to
me
the
judgement
is
in
other
hands
and
yet
unless
i
am
altogether
misled
by
i
have
sung
the
praise
of
folly
and
that
not
altogether
foolishly
and
now
to
reply
to
the
charge
of
mordacity
it
has
ever
been
the
privilege
of
wits
to
satirize
the
life
of
society
with
impunity
provided
that
licence
does
not
degenerate
into
frenzy
wherefore
the
more
do
i
marvel
at
the
fastidiousness
of
men
ears
in
these
times
who
by
now
can
scarce
endure
anything
but
solemn
appellations
further
we
see
some
men
so
perversely
religious
that
they
will
suffer
the
most
hideous
revilings
against
christ
sooner
than
let
prince
or
pope
be
sullied
by
the
lightest
jest
particularly
if
this
concerns
monetary
gain
but
if
a
man
censures
men
lives
without
reproving
anyone
at
all
by
name
pray
do
you
think
this
man
a
satirist
and
not
rather
a
teacher
and
admonisher
else
on
how
many
counts
do
i
censure
myself
moreover
he
who
leaves
no
class
of
men
unmentioned
is
clearly
foe
to
no
man
but
to
all
vices
therefore
anyone
who
rises
up
and
cries
out
that
he
is
insulted
will
be
revealing
a
bad
conscience
or
at
all
events
fear
jerome
wrote
satire
in
this
kind
far
more
free
and
biting
not
always
abstaining
from
the
mention
of
names
whereas
i
myself
apart
from
not
mentioning
anyone
by
name
have
moreover
so
tempered
my
pen
that
the
sagacious
reader
will
easily
understand
that
my
aim
has
been
to
give
pleasure
not
pain
for
i
have
at
no
point
followed
juvenal
example
in
up
the
murky
bilge
of
crime
and
i
have
sought
to
survey
the
laughable
not
the
disgusting
if
there
is
anyone
whom
even
this
can
not
appease
at
least
let
him
remember
that
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
reviled
by
folly
in
bringing
her
upon
the
stage
i
had
to
suit
the
words
to
the
character
but
why
need
i
say
all
this
to
you
an
advocate
so
remarkable
that
you
can
defend
excellently
even
causes
far
from
excellent
farewell
most
eloquent
more
and
be
diligent
in
defending
your
ix
to
john
colet
cambridge
october
to
his
friend
colet
greetings
something
came
into
my
mind
which
i
know
will
make
you
laugh
in
the
presence
of
several
masters
of
arts
i
was
putting
forward
a
view
on
the
assistant
teacher
when
one
of
them
a
man
of
some
repute
smiled
and
said
could
bear
to
spend
his
life
in
that
school
among
boys
when
he
could
live
anywhere
in
any
way
he
liked
i
answered
mildly
that
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
honourable
task
to
train
young
people
in
manners
and
literature
that
christ
himself
did
not
despise
the
young
that
no
age
had
a
better
right
to
help
and
that
from
no
quarter
was
a
richer
return
to
be
expected
seeing
that
young
people
were
the
and
raw
material
of
the
nation
i
added
that
all
truly
religious
people
felt
that
they
could
not
better
serve
god
in
any
other
duty
than
the
bringing
of
children
to
christ
he
wrinkled
his
nose
and
said
with
a
scornful
gesture
any
man
wishes
to
serve
christ
altogether
let
him
go
into
a
monastery
and
enter
a
religious
order
i
answered
that
paul
said
that
true
religion
consisted
in
the
offices
of
charity
charity
consisting
in
doing
our
best
to
help
our
neighbours
this
he
rejected
as
an
ignorant
remark
said
he
have
forsaken
everything
in
this
is
perfection
man
has
not
forsaken
everything
said
i
when
he
could
help
very
many
by
his
labours
refuses
to
undertake
a
duty
because
it
is
regarded
as
humble
and
with
that
to
prevent
a
quarrel
arising
i
let
the
man
go
there
you
have
the
dialogue
you
see
the
scotist
philosophy
once
again
farewell
x
to
servatius
roger
hammes
castle
near
calais
july
to
the
reverend
father
servatius
many
greetings
most
humane
father
your
letter
has
at
last
reached
me
after
passing
through
many
hands
when
i
had
already
left
england
and
it
has
afforded
me
unbelievable
delight
as
it
still
breathes
your
old
affection
for
me
however
i
shall
answer
briefly
as
i
am
writing
just
after
the
journey
and
shall
reply
in
particular
on
those
matters
which
are
as
you
write
strictly
to
the
point
men
thoughts
are
so
varied
each
his
own
that
it
is
impossible
to
satisfy
everyone
my
own
feelings
are
that
i
want
to
follow
what
is
best
to
do
god
is
my
witness
those
feelings
which
i
had
in
my
youth
have
been
corrected
partly
by
age
partly
by
experience
of
the
world
i
have
never
intended
to
change
my
mode
of
life
or
my
habit
not
that
i
liked
them
but
to
avoid
scandal
you
are
aware
that
i
was
not
so
much
led
as
driven
to
this
mode
of
life
by
the
obstinate
determination
of
my
guardians
and
the
wrongful
urgings
of
others
and
that
afterwards
when
i
realized
that
this
kind
of
life
was
quite
unsuited
to
me
for
not
all
things
suit
all
men
i
was
held
back
by
cornelius
of
woerden
reproaches
and
by
a
certain
boyish
sense
of
shame
i
was
never
able
to
endure
fasting
through
some
peculiarity
of
my
constitution
once
roused
from
sleep
i
could
never
fall
asleep
again
for
several
hours
i
was
so
drawn
towards
literature
which
is
not
practised
in
the
monastery
that
i
do
not
doubt
that
if
i
had
chanced
on
some
free
mode
of
life
i
could
have
been
numbered
not
merely
among
the
happy
but
even
among
the
good
so
when
i
realized
that
i
was
by
no
means
fit
for
this
mode
of
life
that
i
had
taken
it
up
under
compulsion
and
not
of
my
own
free
will
nevertheless
as
public
opinion
in
these
days
regards
it
as
a
crime
to
break
away
from
a
mode
of
life
once
taken
up
i
had
resolved
to
endure
with
fortitude
this
part
of
my
unhappiness
also
you
know
that
i
am
in
many
things
unfortunate
but
i
have
always
regarded
this
one
thing
as
harder
than
all
the
rest
that
i
had
been
forced
into
a
mode
of
life
for
which
i
was
totally
unfit
both
in
body
and
in
mind
in
mind
because
i
abhorred
ritual
and
loved
liberty
in
body
because
even
had
i
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
life
my
constitution
could
not
endure
such
labours
one
may
object
that
i
had
a
year
of
probation
as
it
is
called
and
that
i
was
of
ripe
age
ridiculous
as
if
anyone
could
expect
a
boy
of
sixteen
particularly
one
with
a
literary
training
to
know
himself
an
achievement
even
for
an
old
man
or
to
have
succeeded
in
learning
in
a
single
year
what
many
do
not
yet
understand
in
their
grey
hairs
though
i
myself
never
liked
the
life
still
less
after
i
had
tried
it
but
was
trapped
in
the
way
i
have
mentioned
although
i
confess
that
the
truly
good
man
will
live
a
good
life
in
any
calling
and
i
do
not
deny
that
i
was
prone
to
grievous
vices
but
not
of
so
utterly
corrupt
a
nature
that
i
could
not
have
come
to
some
good
had
i
found
a
kindly
guide
a
true
christian
not
one
given
to
jewish
scruples
meanwhile
i
looked
about
to
find
in
what
kind
of
life
i
could
be
least
bad
and
i
believe
indeed
that
i
have
attained
this
i
have
spent
my
life
meantime
among
sober
men
in
literary
studies
which
have
kept
me
off
many
vices
i
have
been
able
to
associate
with
true
followers
of
christ
whose
conversation
has
made
me
a
better
man
i
do
not
now
boast
of
my
books
which
you
at
steyn
perhaps
despise
but
many
confess
that
they
have
become
not
merely
more
knowledgeable
but
even
better
men
through
reading
them
passion
for
money
has
never
affected
me
i
am
quite
untouched
by
the
thirst
for
fame
i
have
never
been
a
slave
to
pleasures
although
i
was
formerly
inclined
to
them
and
drunkenness
i
have
ever
loathed
and
avoided
but
whenever
i
thought
of
returning
to
your
society
i
remembered
the
jealousy
of
many
the
contempt
of
all
the
conversations
how
dull
how
foolish
how
the
feasts
how
unclerical
in
short
the
whole
way
of
life
from
which
if
you
remove
the
ritual
i
do
not
see
what
remains
that
one
could
desire
lastly
i
remembered
my
frail
constitution
now
weakened
by
age
disease
and
hard
work
as
a
result
of
which
i
should
fail
to
satisfy
you
and
kill
myself
for
several
years
now
i
have
been
subject
to
the
stone
a
severe
and
deadly
illness
and
for
several
years
i
have
drunk
nothing
but
wine
and
not
all
kinds
of
wine
at
that
owing
to
my
disease
i
can
not
endure
all
kinds
of
food
nor
indeed
all
climates
the
illness
is
very
liable
to
recur
and
demands
a
very
careful
regimen
and
i
know
the
climate
in
holland
and
your
style
of
living
not
to
mention
your
ways
so
had
i
come
back
to
you
all
i
would
have
achieved
would
have
been
to
bring
trouble
on
you
and
death
on
myself
but
perhaps
you
think
it
a
great
part
of
happiness
to
die
amid
this
belief
deceives
and
imposes
not
on
you
alone
but
on
nearly
everyone
we
make
christian
piety
depend
on
place
dress
style
of
living
and
on
certain
little
rituals
we
think
a
man
lost
who
changes
his
white
dress
for
black
or
his
cowl
for
a
cap
or
occasionally
moves
from
place
to
place
i
should
dare
to
say
that
christian
piety
has
suffered
great
damage
from
these
religious
practices
although
it
may
be
that
their
first
introduction
was
due
to
pious
zeal
they
then
gradually
increased
and
divided
into
thousands
of
distinctions
this
was
helped
by
a
papal
authority
which
was
too
lax
and
in
many
cases
what
more
defiled
or
more
impious
than
these
lax
rituals
and
if
you
turn
to
those
that
are
commended
no
to
the
most
highly
commended
apart
from
some
dreary
jewish
rituals
i
know
not
what
image
of
christ
one
finds
in
them
it
is
these
on
which
they
preen
themselves
these
by
which
they
judge
and
condemn
others
how
much
more
in
conformity
with
the
spirit
of
christ
to
consider
the
whole
christian
world
one
home
and
as
it
were
one
monastery
to
regard
all
men
as
and
to
hold
the
sacrament
of
baptism
as
the
supreme
rite
and
not
to
consider
where
one
lives
but
how
well
one
lives
you
want
me
to
settle
on
a
permanent
abode
a
course
which
my
very
age
also
suggests
but
the
travellings
of
solon
pythagoras
and
plato
are
praised
and
the
apostles
too
were
wanderers
in
particular
paul
jerome
also
was
a
monk
now
in
rome
now
in
syria
now
in
antioch
now
here
now
there
and
even
in
his
old
age
pursued
literary
studies
but
i
am
not
to
be
compared
with
jerome
i
agree
yet
i
have
never
moved
unless
forced
by
the
plague
or
for
reasons
of
study
or
health
and
wherever
i
have
lived
i
shall
say
this
of
myself
arrogantly
perhaps
but
truthfully
i
have
been
commended
by
the
most
highly
commended
and
praised
by
the
most
praised
there
is
no
land
neither
spain
nor
italy
nor
germany
nor
france
nor
england
nor
scotland
which
does
not
summon
me
to
partake
of
its
hospitality
and
if
i
am
not
liked
by
all
which
is
not
my
aim
at
all
events
i
am
liked
in
the
highest
places
of
all
at
rome
there
was
no
cardinal
who
did
not
welcome
me
like
a
brother
in
particular
the
cardinal
of
george
the
cardinal
of
bologna
cardinal
grimani
the
cardinal
of
nantes
and
the
present
pope
not
to
mention
bishops
archdeacons
and
men
of
learning
and
this
honour
was
not
a
tribute
to
wealth
which
even
now
i
neither
possess
nor
desire
nor
to
ambition
a
failing
to
which
i
have
ever
been
a
stranger
but
solely
to
learning
which
our
countrymen
ridicule
while
the
italians
worship
it
in
england
there
is
no
bishop
who
is
not
glad
to
be
greeted
by
me
who
does
not
desire
my
company
who
does
not
want
me
in
his
home
the
king
himself
a
little
before
his
father
death
when
i
was
in
italy
wrote
a
most
affectionate
letter
to
me
with
his
own
hand
and
now
too
speaks
often
of
me
in
the
most
honourable
and
affectionate
terms
and
whenever
i
greet
him
he
welcomes
me
most
courteously
and
looks
at
me
in
a
most
friendly
fashion
making
it
plain
that
his
feelings
for
me
are
as
friendly
as
his
speeches
and
he
has
often
commissioned
his
almoner
to
find
a
benefice
for
me
the
queen
sought
to
take
me
as
her
tutor
everyone
knows
that
if
i
were
prepared
to
live
even
a
few
months
at
court
he
would
heap
on
me
as
many
benefices
as
i
cared
for
but
i
put
my
leisure
and
my
learned
labours
before
everything
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
primate
of
all
england
and
chancellor
of
the
realm
a
good
and
learned
man
could
not
treat
me
with
more
affection
were
i
his
father
or
brother
and
that
you
may
understand
that
he
is
sincere
in
this
he
gave
me
a
living
of
nearly
nobles
which
afterwards
at
my
wish
he
changed
into
a
pension
of
crowns
on
my
resignation
in
addition
he
has
given
me
more
than
nobles
during
the
last
few
years
although
i
never
asked
for
anything
he
gave
me
nobles
in
one
day
i
received
more
than
nobles
from
other
bishops
in
freely
offered
gifts
mountjoy
a
baron
of
the
realm
formerly
my
pupil
gives
me
annually
a
pension
of
crowns
the
king
and
the
bishop
of
lincoln
who
has
great
influence
through
the
king
make
many
splendid
promises
there
are
two
universities
in
england
oxford
and
cambridge
and
both
of
them
want
me
at
cambridge
i
taught
greek
and
sacred
literature
for
several
months
for
nothing
and
have
resolved
always
to
do
this
there
are
colleges
here
so
religious
and
of
such
modesty
in
living
that
you
would
spurn
any
other
religious
life
could
you
see
them
in
london
there
is
john
colet
dean
of
paul
who
has
combined
great
learning
with
a
marvellous
piety
a
man
greatly
respected
by
all
he
is
so
fond
of
me
as
all
know
that
he
prefers
my
company
above
all
others
i
do
not
mention
many
others
lest
i
doubly
vex
you
with
my
loquacity
as
well
as
my
boasting
now
to
say
something
of
my
works
i
think
you
have
read
the
through
which
not
a
few
confess
themselves
inspired
to
the
study
of
piety
i
make
no
claim
for
myself
but
give
thanks
to
christ
for
any
good
which
has
come
to
pass
through
me
by
his
giving
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
seen
the
printed
by
aldus
it
is
not
a
theological
work
but
most
useful
for
every
branch
of
learning
at
least
it
cost
me
countless
labours
and
sleepless
nights
i
have
published
a
work
rerum
verborumque
dedicated
to
my
friend
colet
very
useful
for
those
who
desire
to
speak
in
public
but
all
these
are
despised
by
those
who
despise
all
good
learning
during
the
last
two
years
apart
from
much
else
i
have
emended
the
of
jerome
obelizing
what
was
false
and
spurious
and
explaining
the
obscure
passages
with
notes
i
have
corrected
the
whole
of
the
new
testament
from
collations
of
the
greek
and
ancient
manuscripts
and
have
annotated
more
than
a
thousand
passages
not
without
some
benefit
to
theologians
i
have
begun
commentaries
on
the
of
paul
which
i
shall
complete
when
i
have
published
these
for
i
have
resolved
to
live
and
die
in
the
study
of
the
scriptures
i
make
these
my
work
and
my
leisure
men
of
consequence
say
that
i
can
do
what
others
can
not
in
this
field
in
your
mode
of
life
i
shall
be
able
to
do
nothing
although
i
have
been
intimate
with
so
many
grave
and
learned
men
here
and
in
italy
and
france
i
have
not
yet
found
anyone
who
advised
me
to
return
to
you
or
thought
this
the
better
course
nay
even
nicholas
werner
of
blessed
memory
your
predecessor
would
always
dissuade
me
from
this
advising
me
to
attach
myself
rather
to
some
bishop
he
would
add
that
he
knew
my
mind
and
his
little
brothers
ways
those
were
the
words
he
used
in
the
vernacular
in
the
life
i
live
now
i
see
what
i
should
avoid
but
do
not
see
what
would
be
a
better
course
it
now
remains
to
satisfy
you
on
the
question
of
my
dress
i
have
always
up
to
now
worn
the
canon
dress
and
when
i
was
at
louvain
i
obtained
permission
from
the
bishop
of
utrecht
to
wear
a
linen
scapular
instead
of
a
complete
linen
garment
and
a
black
capuce
instead
of
a
black
cloak
after
the
parisian
custom
but
on
my
journey
to
italy
seeing
the
monks
all
along
the
way
wearing
a
black
garment
with
a
scapular
i
there
took
to
wearing
black
with
a
scapular
to
avoid
giving
offence
by
any
unusual
dress
afterwards
the
plague
broke
out
at
bologna
and
there
those
who
nurse
the
sick
of
the
plague
customarily
wear
a
white
linen
cloth
depending
from
the
shoulder
these
avoid
contact
with
people
consequently
when
one
day
i
went
to
call
on
a
learned
friend
some
rascals
drew
their
swords
and
were
preparing
to
set
about
me
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
a
certain
matron
warned
them
that
i
was
an
ecclesiastic
again
the
next
day
when
i
was
on
my
way
to
visit
the
treasurer
sons
they
rushed
at
me
with
bludgeons
from
all
directions
and
attacked
me
with
horrible
cries
so
on
the
advice
of
good
men
i
concealed
my
scapular
and
obtained
a
dispensation
from
pope
julius
ii
allowing
me
to
wear
the
religious
dress
or
not
as
seemed
good
provided
that
i
wore
clerical
garb
and
in
this
document
he
condoned
any
previous
offences
in
the
matter
in
italy
i
continued
to
wear
clerical
garb
lest
the
change
cause
offence
to
anyone
on
my
return
to
england
i
decided
to
wear
my
usual
dress
and
i
invited
to
my
lodging
a
friend
of
excellent
repute
for
his
learning
and
mode
of
life
and
showed
him
the
dress
i
had
decided
to
wear
i
asked
him
whether
this
was
suitable
in
england
he
approved
so
i
appeared
in
public
in
this
dress
i
was
at
once
warned
by
other
friends
that
this
dress
could
not
be
tolerated
in
england
that
i
had
better
conceal
it
i
did
so
and
as
it
can
not
be
concealed
without
causing
scandal
if
it
is
eventually
discovered
i
stored
it
away
in
a
box
and
up
to
now
have
taken
advantage
of
the
papal
dispensation
received
formerly
ecclesiastical
law
excommunicates
anyone
who
casts
off
the
religious
habit
so
as
to
move
more
freely
in
secular
society
i
put
it
off
under
compulsion
in
italy
to
escape
being
killed
and
likewise
under
compulsion
in
england
because
it
was
not
tolerated
there
although
myself
i
should
much
prefer
to
have
worn
it
to
adopt
it
again
now
would
cause
more
scandal
than
did
the
change
itself
there
you
have
an
account
of
my
whole
life
there
you
have
my
plans
i
should
like
to
change
even
this
present
mode
of
life
if
i
see
a
better
but
i
do
not
see
what
i
am
to
do
in
holland
i
know
that
the
climate
and
way
of
living
will
not
agree
with
me
i
shall
have
everyone
looking
at
me
i
shall
return
a
old
man
having
gone
away
as
a
youth
i
shall
return
a
valetudinarian
i
shall
be
exposed
to
the
contempt
of
the
lowest
used
as
i
am
to
the
respect
of
the
highest
i
shall
exchange
my
studies
for
as
to
your
promising
me
your
help
in
finding
me
a
place
where
i
can
live
with
an
excellent
income
as
you
write
i
can
not
conjecture
what
this
can
be
unless
perhaps
you
intend
to
place
me
among
some
community
of
nuns
to
serve
women
i
who
have
never
been
willing
to
serve
kings
nor
archbishops
i
want
no
pay
i
have
no
desire
for
riches
if
only
i
have
money
enough
to
provide
for
my
health
and
my
literary
leisure
to
enable
me
to
live
without
burdening
anyone
i
wish
we
could
discuss
these
things
together
face
to
face
it
can
not
be
done
in
a
letter
conveniently
or
safely
your
letter
although
it
was
sent
by
most
reliable
persons
went
so
far
astray
that
if
i
had
not
accidentally
come
to
this
castle
i
should
never
have
seen
it
and
many
people
had
looked
at
it
before
i
received
it
so
do
not
mention
anything
secret
unless
you
know
for
certain
where
i
am
and
have
a
very
trustworthy
messenger
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
germany
that
is
basle
to
have
my
works
published
and
this
winter
i
shall
perhaps
be
in
rome
on
my
return
journey
i
shall
see
to
it
that
we
meet
and
talk
somewhere
but
now
the
summer
is
nearly
over
and
it
is
a
long
journey
farewell
once
my
sweetest
comrade
now
my
esteemed
father
xi
to
wolfgang
fabricius
capito
antwerp
february
to
the
distinguished
theologian
wolfgang
fabricius
capito
of
hagenau
skilled
in
the
three
languages
greetings
now
that
i
see
that
the
mightiest
princes
of
the
earth
king
francis
of
france
charles
the
catholic
king
king
henry
of
england
and
the
emperor
maximilian
have
drastically
cut
down
all
warlike
preparations
and
concluded
a
firm
and
i
hope
unbreakable
treaty
of
peace
i
feel
entitled
to
hope
with
confidence
that
not
only
the
moral
virtues
and
christian
piety
but
also
the
true
learning
purified
of
corruption
and
the
fine
disciplines
will
revive
and
blossom
forth
particularly
as
this
aim
is
being
prosecuted
with
equal
zeal
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
rome
by
pope
leo
in
spain
by
the
cardinal
of
toledo
in
england
by
king
henry
viii
himself
no
mean
scholar
here
by
king
charles
a
young
man
admirably
gifted
in
france
by
king
francis
a
man
as
it
were
born
for
this
task
who
besides
offers
splendid
rewards
to
attract
and
entice
men
distinguished
for
virtue
and
learning
from
all
parts
in
germany
by
many
excellent
princes
and
bishops
and
above
all
by
the
emperor
maximilian
who
wearied
in
his
old
age
of
all
these
wars
has
resolved
to
find
rest
in
the
arts
of
peace
a
resolve
at
once
more
becoming
to
himself
at
his
age
and
more
fortunate
for
christendom
it
is
to
these
men
piety
then
that
we
owe
it
that
all
over
the
world
as
if
on
a
given
signal
splendid
talents
are
stirring
and
awakening
and
conspiring
together
to
revive
the
best
learning
for
what
else
is
this
but
a
conspiracy
when
all
these
great
scholars
from
different
lands
share
out
the
work
among
themselves
and
set
about
this
noble
task
not
merely
with
enthusiasm
but
with
a
fair
measure
of
success
so
that
we
have
an
almost
certain
prospect
of
seeing
all
disciplines
emerge
once
more
into
the
light
of
day
in
a
far
purer
and
more
genuine
form
in
the
first
place
polite
letters
for
long
reduced
almost
to
extinction
are
being
taken
up
and
cultivated
by
the
scots
the
danes
and
the
irish
as
for
medicine
how
many
champions
has
she
found
nicholas

by

zasius
mathematics
at
basle
by
henry
glareanus
in
theology
there
was
more
to
do
for
up
till
now
its
professors
have
almost
always
been
men
with
an
ingrained
loathing
for
good
learning
men
who
conceal
their
ignorance
the
more
successfully
as
they
do
this
on
what
they
call
a
religious
pretext
so
that
the
ignorant
herd
is
persuaded
by
them
to
believe
it
a
violation
of
religion
if
anyone
proceeds
to
attack
their
barbarism
for
they
prefer
to
wail
for
help
to
the
uneducated
mob
and
incite
it
to
if
they
see
any
danger
of
their
ignorance
on
any
point
coming
to
light
but
i
am
confident
that
here
too
all
will
go
well
as
soon
as
the
knowledge
of
the
three
languages
greek
latin
and
hebrew
becomes
accepted
publicly
in
the
schools
as
it
has
begun
to
be
the
humblest
share
in
this
work
has
fallen
on
me
as
is
fitting
i
know
not
whether
i
have
contributed
anything
of
value
at
all
events
i
have
infuriated
those
who
do
not
want
the
world
to
come
to
its
senses
so
that
it
seems
as
if
my
poor
efforts
also
have
not
been
ineffective
although
i
have
not
undertaken
the
work
in
the
belief
that
i
could
teach
anything
magnificent
but
i
wanted
to
open
a
road
for
others
destined
to
attempt
greater
things
that
they
might
with
greater
ease
ascend
the
shining
heights
without
running
into
so
many
rough
and
quaggy
places
yet
this
humble
diligence
of
mine
is
not
disdained
by
the
honest
and
learned
and
none
complain
of
it
but
a
few
so
stupid
that
they
are
hissed
off
the
stage
by
even
ordinary
persons
of
any
intelligence
here
not
long
ago
someone
complained
tearfully
before
the
people
in
a
sermon
of
course
that
it
was
all
over
with
the
scriptures
and
the
theologians
who
had
hitherto
upheld
the
christian
faith
on
their
shoulders
now
that
men
had
arisen
to
emend
the
holy
gospel
and
the
very
words
of
our
lord
just
as
if
i
was
rebuking
matthew
or
luke
instead
of
those
whose
ignorance
or
negligence
had
corrupted
what
they
wrote
correctly
in
england
one
or
two
persons
complain
loudly
that
it
is
a
shameful
thing
that
should
dare
to
teach
a
great
man
like
jerome
as
if
i
had
changed
what
jerome
wrote
instead
of
restoring
it
yet
those
who
snarl
out
suchlike
dirges
which
any
laundryman
with
a
little
sense
would
scoff
at
think
themselves
great
theologians
not
that
i
want
the
kind
of
theology
which
is
customary
in
the
schools
nowadays
consigned
to
oblivion
i
wish
it
to
be
rendered
more
trustworthy
and
more
correct
by
the
accession
of
the
old
true
learning
it
will
not
weaken
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
or
theologians
if
certain
passages
hitherto
considered
corrupt
are
henceforth
read
in
an
emended
form
or
if
passages
are
more
correctly
understood
on
which
up
till
now
the
mass
of
theologians
have
entertained
delusions
no
it
will
give
greater
weight
to
their
authority
the
more
genuine
their
understanding
of
the
scriptures
i
have
sustained
the
shock
of
the
first
meeting
which
terence
calls
the
sharpest
one
doubt
still
troubles
me
i
fear
that
under
cover
of
the
rebirth
of
ancient
learning
paganism
may
seek
to
rear
its
head
as
even
among
christians
there
are
those
who
acknowledge
christ
in
name
only
but
in
their
hearts
are
gentiles
or
that
with
the
renascence
of
hebrew
studies
judaism
may
seek
to
use
this
opportunity
of
revival
and
there
can
be
nothing
more
contrary
or
more
hostile
to
the
teaching
of
christ
than
this
plague
this
is
the
nature
of
human
affairs
nothing
good
has
ever
so
flourished
but
some
evil
has
attempted
to
use
it
as
a
pretext
for
insinuating
itself
i
could
wish
that
those
dreary
quibblings
could
be
either
done
away
with
or
at
least
cease
to
be
the
sole
activity
of
theologians
and
that
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
christ
could
penetrate
deeply
into
the
minds
of
men
and
this
i
think
can
best
be
brought
to
pass
if
with
the
help
provided
by
the
three
languages
we
exercise
our
minds
in
the
actual
sources
but
i
pray
that
we
may
avoid
this
evil
without
falling
into
another
perhaps
graver
error
recently
several
pamphlets
have
been
published
reeking
of
unadulterated
judaism
xii
to
thomas
more
louvain
march
to
his
friend
more
greeting
first
of
all
i
ask
you
to
entrust
to
the
bearer
my
servant
john
any
letters
of
mine
or
yours
which
you
consider
fit
for
publication
with
the
alteration
of
some
passages
i
am
simply
compelled
to
publish
my
letters
whether
i
like
it
or
not
send
off
the
lad
so
that
he
returns
here
as
quickly
as
possible
if
you
discover
that
urswick
is
towards
me
perhaps
he
should
not
be
troubled
otherwise
help
me
in
the
matter
of
a
horse
i
shall
need
one
just
now
when
i
am
about
to
go
to
basle
or
venice
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
out
the
new
testament
such
is
my
fate
dear
more
i
shall
enact
this
part
of
my
play
also
afterwards
i
almost
feel
inclined
to
sing
myself
and
the
muses
my
age
and
my
health
which
grows
daily
worse
almost
require
this
over
here
scoundrels
in
disguise
are
so
and
no
one
here
makes
money
but
innkeepers
advocates
and
begging
friars
it
is
unendurable
when
many
speak
ill
and
none
do
good
at
basle
they
make
the
elegant
preface
added
by
budaeus
the
excuse
for
the
delay
over
your
utopia
they
have
now
received
it
and
have
started
on
the
work
then
froben
lachner
died
but
press
will
be
sweating
over
our
studies
none
the
less
i
have
not
yet
had
a
chance
of
seeing
linacre
through
some
conspiracy
of
the
parisians
against
me
inquire
courteously
of
lupset
on
the
appendix
to
my
and
send
it
the
pope
and
the
princes
are
up
to
some
new
tricks
on
the
pretext
of
the
savagery
of
the
war
against
the
turks
wretched
turks
may
we
christians
not
be
too
cruel
even
wives
are
affected
all
married
men
between
the
ages
of
and
fifty
will
be
compelled
to
take
up
arms
meanwhile
the
pope
forbids
the
wives
of
men
absent
at
the
war
to
indulge
in
pleasure
at
home
they
are
to
eschew
elegant
apparel
must
not
wear
silk
gold
or
any
jewellery
must
not
touch
rouge
or
drink
wine
and
must
fast
every
other
day
that
god
may
favour
their
husbands
engaged
in
this
cruel
war
if
there
are
men
tied
at
home
by
necessary
business
their
wives
must
none
the
less
observe
the
same
rules
as
they
would
have
had
to
observe
if
their
husbands
had
gone
to
the
war
they
are
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
but
in
different
beds
and
not
a
kiss
is
to
be
given
meanwhile
until
this
terrible
war
reaches
a
successful
conclusion
under
christ
favour
i
know
that
these
enactments
will
irritate
wives
who
do
not
sufficiently
ponder
the
importance
of
the
business
though
i
know
that
your
wife
sensible
as
she
is
and
obedient
in
regard
to
a
matter
of
christian
observance
will
even
be
glad
to
obey
i
send
pace
pamphlet
the
on
papal
and
the
for
undertaking
a
war
against
the
as
i
suspect
that
they
have
not
yet
reached
england
they
write
from
cologne
that
some
pamphlet
about
an
argument
between
julius
and
peter
at
the
gates
of
paradise
has
now
been
printed
they
do
not
add
the
author
name
the
german
presses
will
not
cease
from
their
mad
pranks
until
their
rashness
is
restrained
by
some
law
this
does
me
much
harm
who
am
endeavouring
to
help
the
world
i
beg
you
to
let
my
servant
sleep
one
or
two
nights
with
yours
to
prevent
his
chancing
on
an
infected
house
and
to
afford
him
anything
he
may
need
although
i
have
supplied
him
with
travelling
money
myself
i
have
at
last
seen
the
at
paris
printed
but
with
many
misprints
it
is
now
in
the
press
at
basle
i
had
threatened
to
break
with
them
unless
they
took
more
trouble
with
that
business
than
with
mine
farewell
most
sincere
of
friends
xiii
to
beatus
rhenanus
louvain
october
to
his
friend
rhenanus
greetings
let
me
describe
to
you
my
dear
beatus
the
whole
of
my
journey
i
was
still
weak
and
listless
as
you
know
when
i
left
basle
not
having
come
to
terms
with
the
climate
after
skulking
at
home
so
long
and
occupied
in
uninterrupted
labors
at
that
the
river
voyage
was
not
unpleasant
but
that
around
midday
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
somewhat
trying
we
had
a
meal
at
breisach
the
most
unpleasant
meal
i
have
ever
had
the
smell
of
food
nearly
finished
me
and
then
the
flies
worse
than
the
smell
we
sat
at
table
doing
nothing
for
more
than
half
an
hour
waiting
for
them
to
produce
their
banquet
if
you
please
in
the
end
nothing
fit
to
eat
was
served
filthy
porridge
with
lumps
in
it
and
salt
fish
reheated
not
for
the
first
time
enough
to
make
one
sick
i
did
not
call
on
gallinarius
the
man
who
brought
word
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
slight
fever
also
told
me
a
pretty
story
that
minorite
theologian
with
whom
i
had
disputed
about
had
taken
it
on
himself
to
pawn
the
church
chalices
scotist
ingenuity
just
before
nightfall
we
were
put
out
at
a
dull
village
i
did
not
feel
like
discovering
its
name
and
if
i
knew
i
should
not
care
to
tell
you
it
i
nearly
perished
there
we
had
supper
in
a
small
room
like
a
more
than
sixty
of
us
i
should
say
an
indiscriminate
collection
of
rapscallions
and
this
went
on
till
nearly
ten
oh
the
stench
and
the
noise
particularly
after
they
had
become
intoxicated
yet
we
had
to
remain
sitting
to
suit
their
clocks
in
the
morning
while
it
was
still
quite
dark
we
were
driven
from
bed
by
the
shouting
of
the
sailors
i
went
on
board
without
having
either
supped
or
slept
we
reached
strasbourg
before
lunch
at
about
nine
there
we
had
a
more
comfortable
reception
particularly
as
schürer
produced
some
wine
some
of
the
society
were
there
and
afterwards
they
all
came
to
greet
me
gerbel
outdoing
all
the
rest
in
politeness
gebwiler
and
rudolfingen
did
not
want
me
to
pay
no
new
thing
with
them
thence
we
proceeded
on
horseback
as
far
as
speyer
we
saw
no
sign
of
soldiers
anywhere
although
there
had
been
alarming
rumours
the
english
horse
completely
collapsed
and
hardly
got
to
speyer
that
criminal
smith
had
handled
him
so
badly
that
he
ought
to
have
both
his
ears
branded
with
iron
at
speyer
i
slipped
away
from
the
inn
and
took
myself
to
my
neighbour
maternus
there
decanus
a
learned
and
cultivated
man
entertained
me
courteously
and
agreeably
for
two
days
here
i
accidentally
found
hermann
busch
from
speyer
i
travelled
by
carriage
to
worms
and
from
there
again
to
mainz
there
was
an
imperial
secretary
ulrich
varnbüler
travelling
by
chance
in
the
same
carriage
he
devoted
himself
to
me
with
incredible
assiduity
over
the
whole
journey
and
at
mainz
would
not
allow
me
to
go
into
the
inn
but
took
me
to
the
house
of
a
canon
on
my
departure
he
accompanied
me
to
the
boat
the
voyage
was
not
unpleasant
as
the
weather
was
fine
excepting
that
the
crew
took
care
to
make
it
somewhat
long
in
addition
to
this
the
stench
of
the
horses
incommoded
me
for
the
first
day
john
langenfeld
who
formerly
taught
at
louvain
and
a
lawyer
friend
of
his
came
with
me
as
a
mark
of
politeness
there
was
also
a
westphalian
john
a
canon
at
victor
outside
mainz
a
most
agreeable
and
entertaining
man
after
arriving
at
boppard
as
i
was
taking
a
walk
along
the
bank
while
a
boat
was
being
procured
someone
recognized
me
and
betrayed
me
to
the
customs
officer
is
the
man
the
customs
officer
name
is
if
i
mistake
not
christopher
cinicampius
in
the
common
speech
eschenfelder
you
would
not
believe
how
the
man
jumped
for
joy
he
dragged
me
into
his
house
books
by
erasmus
were
lying
on
a
small
table
amongst
the
customs
agreements
he
exclaimed
at
his
good
fortune
and
called
in
his
wife
and
children
and
all
his
friends
meanwhile
he
sent
out
to
the
sailors
who
were
calling
for
me
two
tankards
of
wine
and
another
two
when
they
called
out
again
promising
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
remit
the
toll
to
the
man
who
had
brought
him
a
man
like
myself
from
boppard
john
flaminius
chaplain
to
the
nuns
there
a
man
of
angelic
purity
of
sane
and
sober
judgement
and
no
common
learning
accompanied
me
as
far
as
coblenz
at
coblenz
matthias
chancellor
to
the
bishop
swept
us
off
to
his
house
he
is
a
young
man
but
of
staid
manners
and
has
an
accurate
knowledge
of
latin
besides
being
a
skilled
lawyer
there
we
supped
merrily
at
bonn
the
canon
left
us
to
avoid
cologne
i
wanted
to
avoid
cologne
myself
but
the
servant
had
preceded
me
thither
with
the
horses
and
there
was
no
reliable
person
in
the
boat
whom
i
could
have
charged
with
the
business
of
calling
back
my
servant
i
did
not
trust
the
sailors
so
we
docked
at
cologne
before
six
in
the
morning
on
a
sunday
the
weather
being
by
now
pestilential
i
went
into
an
inn
and
gave
orders
to
the
ostlers
to
hire
me
a
carriage
and
pair
ordering
a
meal
to
be
made
ready
by
ten
i
attended
divine
service
the
lunch
was
delayed
i
had
no
luck
with
the
carriage
and
pair
i
tried
to
hire
a
horse
my
own
were
useless
everything
failed
i
realized
what
was
up
they
were
trying
to
make
me
stop
there
i
immediately
ordered
my
horses
to
be
harnessed
and
one
bag
to
be
loaded
the
other
bag
i
entrusted
to
the
innkeeper
and
on
my
lame
horse
rode
quickly
to
the
count
of
neuenahr
a
journey
he
was
staying
at
bedburg
with
the
count
i
stayed
five
days
very
pleasantly
in
such
peace
and
quiet
that
while
staying
with
him
i
completed
a
good
part
of
the
revision
i
had
taken
that
part
of
the
new
testament
with
me
would
that
you
knew
him
my
dear
beatus
he
is
a
young
man
but
of
rare
good
sense
more
than
you
would
find
in
an
old
man
he
speaks
little
but
as
homer
says
of
menelaus
he
speaks
clear
tones
and
intelligently
too
he
is
learned
without
pretentiousness
in
more
than
one
branch
of
study
wholly
sincere
and
a
good
friend
by
now
i
was
strong
and
lusty
and
well
pleased
with
myself
and
was
hoping
to
be
in
a
good
state
when
i
visited
the
bishop
of
liége
and
to
return
hale
and
hearty
to
my
friends
in
brabant
what
what
felicitations
what
discussions
i
promised
myself
but
ah
deceptive
human
hopes
ah
the
sudden
and
unexpected
vicissitudes
of
human
affairs
from
these
high
dreams
of
happiness
i
was
hurled
to
the
depths
of
misfortune
i
had
hired
a
carriage
and
pair
for
the
next
day
my
companion
not
wanting
to
say
goodbye
before
night
announced
that
he
would
see
me
in
the
morning
before
my
departure
that
night
a
wild
hurricane
sprang
up
which
had
passed
before
the
next
morning
nevertheless
i
rose
after
midnight
to
make
some
notes
for
the
count
when
it
was
already
seven
and
the
count
did
not
emerge
i
asked
for
him
to
be
waked
he
came
and
in
his
customary
shy
and
modest
way
asked
me
whether
i
meant
to
leave
in
such
bad
weather
saying
he
was
afraid
for
me
at
that
point
my
dear
beatus
some
god
or
bad
angel
deprived
me
not
of
the
half
of
my
senses
as
hesiod
says
but
of
the
whole
for
he
had
deprived
me
of
half
my
senses
when
i
risked
going
to
cologne
i
wish
that
either
my
friend
had
warned
me
more
sharply
or
that
i
had
paid
more
attention
to
his
most
affectionate
remonstrances
i
was
seized
by
the
power
of
fate
what
else
am
i
to
say
i
climbed
into
an
uncovered
carriage
the
wind
blowing
as
when
in
the
high
mountains
it
shivers
the
trembling
it
was
a
south
wind
and
blowing
like
the
very
pest
i
thought
i
was
well
protected
by
my
wrappings
but
it
went
through
everything
with
its
violence
towards
nightfall
a
light
rain
came
on
more
noxious
than
the
wind
that
preceded
it
i
arrived
at
aachen
exhausted
from
the
shaking
of
the
carriage
which
was
so
trying
to
me
on
the
road
that
i
should
have
preferred
sitting
on
my
horse
lame
as
he
was
here
i
was
carried
off
from
the
inn
by
a
canon
to
whom
the
count
had
recommended
me
to
suderman
house
there
several
canons
were
holding
their
usual
my
appetite
had
been
sharpened
by
a
very
light
lunch
but
at
the
time
they
had
nothing
by
them
but
carp
and
cold
carp
at
that
i
ate
to
repletion
the
drinking
went
on
well
into
the
night
i
excused
myself
and
went
to
bed
as
i
had
had
very
little
sleep
the
night
before
on
the
following
day
i
was
taken
to
the
house
it
was
his
turn
to
offer
hospitality
as
there
was
no
fish
there
apart
from
eel
this
was
certainly
the
fault
of
the
storm
as
he
is
a
magnificent
host
otherwise
i
lunched
off
a
fish
dried
in
the
open
air
which
the
germans
call
from
the
rod
used
to
beat
it
it
is
a
fish
which
i
enjoy
at
other
times
but
i
discovered
that
part
of
this
one
had
not
been
properly
cured
after
lunch
as
the
weather
was
appalling
i
took
myself
off
to
the
inn
and
ordered
a
fire
to
be
lit
the
canon
whom
i
mentioned
a
most
cultured
man
stayed
talking
with
me
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
meanwhile
i
began
to
feel
very
uncomfortable
inside
as
this
continued
i
sent
him
away
and
went
to
the
privy
as
this
gave
my
stomach
no
relief
i
inserted
my
finger
into
my
mouth
and
the
uncured
fish
came
up
but
that
was
all
i
lay
down
afterwards
not
so
much
sleeping
as
resting
without
any
pain
in
my
head
or
body
then
having
struck
a
bargain
with
the
coachman
over
the
bags
i
received
an
invitation
to
the
evening
compotation
i
excused
myself
without
success
i
knew
that
my
stomach
would
not
stand
anything
but
a
few
sups
of
warmed
liquor
on
this
occasion
there
was
a
magnificent
spread
but
it
was
wasted
on
me
after
comforting
my
stomach
with
a
sup
of
wine
i
went
home
i
was
sleeping
at
suderman
house
as
soon
as
i
went
out
of
doors
my
empty
body
shivered
fearfully
in
the
night
air
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
after
taking
a
little
warmed
ale
and
a
few
morsels
of
bread
i
mounted
my
horse
who
was
lame
and
ailing
which
made
riding
more
uncomfortable
by
now
i
was
in
such
a
state
that
i
would
have
been
better
keeping
warm
in
bed
than
mounted
on
horseback
but
that
district
is
the
most
countrified
roughest
barren
and
unattractive
imaginable
the
inhabitants
are
so
idle
so
that
i
preferred
to
run
away
the
danger
of
brigands
it
was
very
great
in
those
parts
or
at
least
my
fear
of
them
was
driven
out
of
my
mind
by
the
discomfort
of
my
illness
after
covering
four
miles
on
this
ride
i
reached
maastricht
there
after
a
drink
to
soothe
my
stomach
i
remounted
and
came
to
tongres
about
three
miles
away
this
last
ride
was
by
far
the
most
painful
to
me
the
awkward
gait
of
the
horse
gave
me
excruciating
pains
in
the
kidneys
it
would
have
been
easier
to
walk
but
i
was
afraid
of
sweating
and
there
was
a
danger
of
the
night
catching
us
still
out
in
the
country
so
i
reached
tongres
with
my
whole
body
in
a
state
of
unbelievable
agony
by
now
owing
to
lack
of
food
and
the
exertion
in
addition
all
my
muscles
had
given
way
so
that
i
could
not
stand
or
walk
steadily
i
concealed
the
severity
of
my
illness
by
my
tongue
that
was
still
working
here
i
took
a
sup
of
ale
to
soothe
my
stomach
and
retired
to
bed
in
the
morning
i
ordered
them
to
hire
a
carriage
i
decided
to
go
on
horseback
on
account
of
the
paving
stones
until
we
reached
an
unpaved
road
i
mounted
the
bigger
horse
thinking
that
he
would
go
better
on
the
paving
and
be
more
i
had
hardly
mounted
when
i
felt
my
eyes
clouding
over
as
i
met
the
cold
air
and
asked
for
a
cloak
but
soon
after
this
i
fainted
i
could
be
roused
by
a
touch
then
my
servant
john
and
the
others
standing
by
let
me
come
to
myself
naturally
still
sitting
on
the
horse
after
coming
to
myself
i
got
into
the
carriage
by
now
we
were
approaching
the
town
of
trond
i
mounted
once
more
not
to
appear
an
invalid
riding
in
a
carriage
once
again
the
evening
air
made
me
feel
sick
but
i
did
not
faint
i
offered
the
coachman
double
the
fare
if
he
would
take
me
the
next
day
as
far
as
tirlemont
a
town
six
miles
from
tongres
he
accepted
the
terms
here
a
guest
whom
i
knew
told
me
how
ill
the
bishop
of
liége
had
taken
my
leaving
for
basle
without
calling
on
him
after
soothing
my
stomach
with
a
drink
i
went
to
bed
and
had
a
very
bad
night
here
by
chance
i
found
a
coach
going
to
louvain
six
miles
away
and
threw
myself
into
it
i
made
the
journey
in
incredible
and
almost
unendurable
discomfort
however
we
reached
louvain
by
seven
on
that
day
i
had
no
intention
of
going
to
my
own
room
whether
because
i
had
a
suspicion
that
all
would
be
cold
there
or
that
i
did
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
interfering
with
the
amenities
of
the
college
in
any
way
if
i
started
a
rumour
of
the
plague
i
went
to
theodoric
the
printer
during
the
night
a
large
ulcer
broke
without
my
feeling
it
and
the
pain
had
died
down
the
next
day
i
called
a
surgeon
he
applied
poultices
a
third
ulcer
had
appeared
on
my
back
caused
by
a
servant
at
tongres
when
he
was
anointing
me
with
oil
of
roses
for
the
pain
in
the
kidneys
and
rubbed
one
of
my
ribs
too
hard
with
a
horny
finger
the
surgeon
on
his
way
out
told
theodoric
and
his
servant
secretly
that
it
was
the
plague
he
would
send
poultices
but
would
not
come
to
see
me
himself
when
the
surgeon
failed
to
return
after
a
day
or
two
i
asked
theodoric
the
reason
he
made
some
excuse
but
i
suspecting
what
the
matter
was
said
does
he
think
it
is
the
plague
said
he
insists
that
you
have
three
i
laughed
and
did
not
allow
myself
even
to
imagine
that
i
had
the
plague
after
some
days
the
surgeon
father
came
examined
me
and
assured
me
that
it
was
the
true
plague
even
so
i
could
not
be
convinced
i
secretly
sent
for
another
doctor
who
had
a
great
reputation
he
examined
me
and
being
something
of
a
clown
said
should
not
be
afraid
to
sleep
with
you
and
make
love
to
you
too
if
you
were
a
woman
still
another
doctor
is
summoned
but
does
not
return
as
promised
sending
his
servant
instead
i
dismissed
the
man
and
losing
my
temper
with
the
doctors
commended
myself
to
christ
as
my
doctor
my
appetite
came
back
within
three
days
i
then
immediately
returned
to
my
studies
and
completed
what
was
still
wanting
to
my
new
testament
i
had
given
orders
as
soon
as
i
arrived
that
no
one
was
to
visit
me
unless
summoned
by
name
lest
i
should
frighten
anyone
or
suffer
inconvenience
from
anyone
assiduity
but
dorp
forced
his
way
in
first
of
all
then
ath
mark
laurin
and
paschasius
berselius
who
came
every
day
did
much
to
make
me
well
with
their
delightful
company
my
dear
beatus
who
would
have
believed
that
this
meagre
delicate
body
of
mine
weakened
now
by
age
also
could
have
succeeded
after
all
the
troubles
of
travel
and
all
my
studious
exertions
in
standing
up
to
all
these
physical
ills
as
well
you
know
how
ill
i
was
not
long
ago
at
basle
more
than
once
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
that
year
would
be
fatal
to
me
illness
followed
illness
always
more
severe
but
at
the
very
time
when
this
illness
was
at
its
height
i
felt
no
torturing
desire
to
live
and
no
trepidation
at
the
fear
of
death
my
whole
hope
was
in
christ
alone
and
i
prayed
only
that
he
would
give
me
what
he
judged
most
salutary
for
me
in
my
youth
long
ago
as
i
remember
i
would
shiver
at
the
very
name
of
death
this
at
least
i
have
achieved
as
i
have
grown
older
that
i
do
not
greatly
fear
death
and
i
do
not
measure
man
happiness
by
number
of
days
i
have
passed
my
fiftieth
year
as
so
few
out
of
so
many
reach
this
age
i
can
not
rightly
complain
that
i
have
not
lived
long
enough
and
then
if
this
has
any
relevance
i
have
by
now
already
prepared
a
monument
to
bear
witness
to
posterity
that
i
have
lived
and
perhaps
if
as
the
poets
tell
jealousy
falls
silent
after
death
fame
will
shine
out
the
more
brightly
although
it
ill
becomes
a
christian
heart
to
be
moved
by
human
glory
may
i
have
the
glory
of
pleasing
christ
farewell
my
dearest
beatus
the
rest
you
will
learn
from
my
letter
to
capito
xiv
to
martin
luther
louvain
may
best
greetings
most
beloved
brother
in
christ
your
letter
was
most
welcome
to
me
displaying
a
shrewd
wit
and
breathing
a
christian
spirit
i
could
never
find
words
to
express
what
commotions
your
books
have
brought
about
here
they
can
not
even
now
eradicate
from
their
minds
the
most
false
suspicion
that
your
works
were
composed
with
my
aid
and
that
i
am
the
of
this
party
as
they
call
it
they
thought
that
they
had
found
a
handle
wherewith
to
crush
good
learning
which
they
mortally
detest
as
threatening
to
dim
the
majesty
of
theology
a
thing
they
value
far
above
christ
and
at
the
same
time
to
crush
me
whom
they
consider
as
having
some
influence
on
the
revival
of
studies
the
whole
affair
was
conducted
with
such
clamourings
wild
talk
trickery
detraction
and
cunning
that
had
i
not
been
present
and
witnessed
nay
all
this
i
should
never
have
taken
any
word
for
it
that
theologians
could
act
so
madly
you
would
have
thought
it
some
mortal
plague
and
yet
the
poison
of
this
evil
beginning
with
a
few
has
spread
so
far
abroad
that
a
great
part
of
this
university
was
running
mad
with
the
infection
of
this
not
uncommon
disease
i
declared
that
you
were
quite
unknown
to
me
that
i
had
not
yet
read
your
books
and
accordingly
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
of
anything
in
them
i
only
warned
them
not
to
clamour
before
the
populace
in
so
hateful
a
manner
without
having
yet
read
your
books
this
matter
was
concern
whose
judgement
should
carry
the
greatest
weight
further
i
begged
them
to
consider
also
whether
it
were
expedient
to
traduce
before
a
mixed
multitude
views
which
were
more
properly
refuted
in
books
or
discussed
between
educated
persons
particularly
as
the
author
way
of
life
was
extolled
by
one
and
all
i
failed
miserably
up
to
this
day
they
continue
to
rave
in
their
insinuating
nay
slanderous
disputations
how
often
have
we
agreed
to
make
peace
how
often
have
they
stirred
up
new
commotions
from
some
rashly
conceived
shred
of
suspicion
and
these
men
think
themselves
theologians
theologians
are
not
liked
in
court
circles
here
this
too
they
put
down
to
me
the
bishops
all
favour
me
greatly
these
men
put
no
trust
in
books
their
hope
of
victory
is
based
on
cunning
alone
i
disdain
them
relying
on
my
knowledge
that
i
am
in
the
right
they
are
becoming
a
little
milder
towards
yourself
they
fear
my
pen
because
of
their
bad
conscience
and
i
would
indeed
paint
them
in
their
true
colours
as
they
deserve
did
not
christ
teaching
and
example
summon
me
elsewhere
wild
beasts
can
be
tamed
by
kindness
which
makes
these
men
wild
there
are
persons
in
england
and
they
in
the
highest
positions
who
think
very
well
of
your
writings
here
too
there
are
people
among
them
the
bishop
of
liége
who
favour
your
followers
as
for
me
i
keep
myself
as
far
as
possible
neutral
the
better
to
assist
the
new
flowering
of
good
learning
and
it
seems
to
me
that
more
can
be
done
by
unassuming
courteousness
than
by
violence
it
was
thus
that
christ
brought
the
world
under
his
sway
and
thus
that
paul
made
away
with
the
jewish
law
by
interpreting
all
things
allegorically
it
is
wiser
to
cry
out
against
those
who
abuse
the
popes
authority
than
against
the
popes
themselves
and
i
think
that
we
should
act
in
the
same
way
with
the
kings
as
for
the
schools
we
should
not
so
much
reject
them
as
recall
them
to
more
reasonable
studies
where
things
are
too
generally
accepted
to
be
suddenly
eradicated
from
men
minds
we
must
argue
with
repeated
and
efficacious
proofs
and
not
make
positive
assertions
the
poisonous
contentions
of
certain
persons
are
better
ignored
than
refuted
we
must
everywhere
take
care
never
to
speak
or
act
arrogantly
or
in
a
party
spirit
this
i
believe
is
pleasing
to
the
spirit
of
christ
meanwhile
we
must
preserve
our
minds
from
being
seduced
by
anger
hatred
or
ambition
these
feelings
are
apt
to
lie
in
wait
for
us
in
the
midst
of
our
strivings
after
piety
i
am
not
advising
you
to
do
this
but
only
to
continue
doing
what
you
are
doing
i
have
looked
into
your
commentaries
on
the
psalms
i
am
delighted
with
them
and
hope
that
they
will
do
much
good
at
antwerp
we
have
the
prior
of
the
monastery
a
christian
without
spot
who
loves
you
exceedingly
an
old
pupil
of
yours
as
he
says
he
is
almost
alone
of
them
all
in
preaching
christ
the
others
preach
human
trivialities
or
their
own
gain
i
have
written
to
melanchthon
the
lord
jesus
impart
you
his
spirit
each
day
more
bountifully
to
his
own
glory
and
the
good
of
all
i
had
not
your
letter
at
hand
when
writing
this
xv
to
ulrich
hutten
antwerp
july
to
the
illustrious
knight
ulrich
hutten
greetings
as
to
your
demand
for
a
complete
portrait
as
it
were
of
more
would
that
i
could
execute
it
with
a
perfection
to
match
the
intensity
of
your
desire
it
will
be
a
pleasure
for
me
as
well
to
dwell
for
a
space
on
the
contemplation
of
by
far
the
sweetest
friend
of
all
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
given
to
every
man
to
explore
all
gifts
and
then
i
wonder
whether
he
will
tolerate
being
depicted
by
an
indifferent
artist
for
i
think
it
no
less
a
task
to
portray
more
than
it
would
be
to
portray
alexander
the
great
or
achilles
and
they
were
no
more
deserving
of
immortality
than
he
is
such
a
subject
requires
in
short
the
pencil
of
an
apelles
but
i
fear
that
i
am
more
like
gladiators
than
apelles
nevertheless
i
shall
try
to
sketch
you
an
image
rather
than
a
full
portrait
of
the
whole
man
so
far
as
my
observation
or
recollection
from
long
association
with
him
in
his
home
has
made
this
possible
if
ever
you
meet
him
on
some
embassy
you
will
then
for
the
first
time
understand
how
unskilled
an
artist
you
have
chosen
for
this
commission
and
i
am
downright
afraid
of
your
accusing
me
of
jealousy
or
blindness
that
out
of
so
many
excellences
so
few
have
been
perceived
by
my
poor
sight
or
recorded
by
my
jealousy
but
to
begin
with
that
side
of
more
of
which
you
know
nothing
in
height
and
stature
he
is
not
tall
nor
again
noticeably
short
but
there
is
such
symmetry
in
all
his
limbs
as
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
here
he
has
a
fair
skin
his
complexion
glowing
rather
than
pale
though
far
from
ruddy
but
for
a
very
faint
rosiness
shining
through
his
hair
is
of
a
darkish
blond
or
if
you
will
a
lightish
brown
his
beard
scanty
his
eyes
bluish
grey
with
flecks
here
and
there
this
usually
denotes
a
happy
nature
and
is
also
thought
attractive
by
the
english
whereas
we
are
more
taken
by
dark
eyes
it
is
said
that
no
type
of
eyes
is
less
subject
to
defects
his
expression
corresponds
to
his
character
always
showing
a
pleasant
and
friendly
gaiety
and
rather
set
in
a
smiling
look
and
to
speak
honestly
better
suited
to
merriment
than
to
seriousness
and
solemnity
though
far
removed
from
silliness
or
buffoonery
his
right
shoulder
seems
a
little
higher
than
the
left
particularly
when
he
is
walking
this
is
not
natural
to
him
but
due
to
force
of
habit
like
many
of
the
little
habits
which
we
pick
up
there
is
nothing
to
strike
one
in
the
rest
of
his
body
only
his
hands
are
somewhat
clumsy
but
only
when
compared
with
the
rest
of
his
appearance
he
has
always
from
a
boy
been
very
careless
of
everything
to
do
with
personal
adornment
to
the
point
of
not
greatly
caring
for
those
things
which
according
to
ovid
teaching
should
be
the
sole
care
of
men
one
can
tell
even
now
from
his
appearance
in
maturity
how
handsome
he
must
have
been
as
a
young
man
although
when
i
first
came
to
know
him
he
was
not
more
than
three
and
twenty
years
old
for
he
is
now
barely
forty
his
health
is
not
so
much
robust
as
satisfactory
but
equal
to
all
tasks
becoming
an
honourable
citizen
subject
to
no
or
at
least
very
few
diseases
there
is
every
prospect
of
his
living
long
as
he
has
a
father
of
great
age
but
a
wondrously
fresh
and
green
old
age
i
have
never
yet
seen
anyone
less
fastidious
in
his
choice
of
food
until
he
grew
up
he
liked
water
to
drink
in
this
he
took
after
his
father
but
so
as
to
avoid
irritating
anyone
over
this
he
would
deceive
his
comrades
by
drinking
from
a
pewter
pot
ale
that
was
very
nearly
all
water
often
pure
water
wine
the
custom
in
england
is
to
invite
each
other
to
drink
from
the
same
goblet
he
would
often
sip
with
his
lips
not
to
give
the
appearance
of
disliking
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
accustom
himself
to
common
ways
he
preferred
beef
salt
fish
and
bread
of
the
second
quality
well
risen
to
the
foods
commonly
regarded
as
delicacies
otherwise
he
was
by
no
means
averse
to
all
sources
of
innocent
pleasure
even
to
the
appetite
he
has
always
had
a
great
liking
for
milk
foods
and
fruit
he
enjoys
eating
eggs
his
voice
is
neither
strong
nor
at
all
weak
but
easily
audible
by
no
means
soft
or
melodious
but
the
voice
of
a
clear
speaker
for
he
seems
to
have
no
natural
gift
for
vocal
music
although
he
delights
in
every
kind
of
music
his
speech
is
wonderfully
clear
and
distinct
with
no
trace
of
haste
or
hesitation
he
likes
to
dress
simply
and
does
not
wear
silk
or
purple
or
gold
chains
excepting
where
it
would
not
be
decent
not
to
wear
them
it
is
strange
how
careless
he
is
of
the
formalities
by
which
the
vulgar
judge
good
manners
he
neither
insists
on
these
from
any
nor
does
he
anxiously
force
them
on
others
whether
at
meetings
or
at
entertainments
although
he
knows
them
well
enough
should
he
choose
to
indulge
in
them
but
he
considers
it
effeminate
and
not
becoming
masculine
dignity
to
waste
a
good
part
of
one
time
in
suchlike
inanities
formerly
he
disliked
court
life
and
the
company
of
princes
for
the
reason
that
he
has
always
had
a
peculiar
loathing
for
tyranny
just
as
he
has
always
loved
equality
now
you
will
hardly
find
any
court
so
modest
that
has
not
about
it
much
noisy
ostentation
dissimulation
and
luxury
while
yet
being
quite
free
of
any
kind
of
tyranny
indeed
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
he
could
be
dragged
into
the
court
of
henry
viii
although
nothing
more
courteous
and
unassuming
than
this
prince
could
be
desired
he
is
by
nature
somewhat
greedy
of
independence
and
leisure
but
while
he
gladly
takes
advantage
of
leisure
when
it
comes
his
way
none
is
more
careful
or
patient
whenever
business
demands
it
he
seems
born
and
created
for
friendship
which
he
cultivates
most
sincerely
and
fosters
most
steadfastly
he
is
not
one
to
be
afraid
of
the
of
friends
which
hesiod
does
not
approve
he
is
ready
to
enter
into
friendly
relations
with
any
he
is
in
no
way
fastidious
in
choosing
friends
accommodating
in
maintaining
them
constant
in
keeping
them
if
he
chances
on
anyone
whose
defects
he
can
not
mend
he
dismisses
him
when
the
opportunity
offers
not
breaking
but
gradually
dissolving
the
friendship
whenever
he
finds
any
sincere
and
suited
to
his
disposition
he
so
delights
in
their
company
and
conversation
that
he
appears
to
make
this
his
chief
pleasure
in
life
he
loathes
cards
and
gambling
and
the
other
games
with
which
the
ordinary
run
of
men
of
rank
are
used
to
kill
time
furthermore
while
he
is
somewhat
careless
of
his
own
affairs
there
is
none
more
diligent
in
looking
after
his
friends
affairs
need
i
continue
should
anyone
want
a
finished
example
of
true
friendship
he
could
not
do
better
than
seek
it
in
more
in
social
intercourse
he
is
of
so
rare
a
courtesy
and
charm
of
manners
that
there
is
no
man
so
melancholy
that
he
does
not
gladden
no
subject
so
forbidding
that
he
does
not
dispel
the
tedium
of
it
from
his
boyhood
he
has
loved
joking
so
that
he
might
seem
born
for
this
but
in
his
jokes
he
has
never
descended
to
buffoonery
and
has
never
loved
the
biting
jest
as
a
youth
he
both
composed
and
acted
in
little
comedies
any
witty
remark
he
would
still
enjoy
even
were
it
directed
against
himself
such
is
his
delight
in
clever
sallies
of
ingenious
flavour
as
a
result
he
wrote
epigrams
as
a
young
man
and
delighted
particularly
in
lucian
indeed
he
was
responsible
for
my
writing
the
of
that
is
for
making
the
camel
dance
in
human
relations
he
looks
for
pleasure
in
everything
he
comes
across
even
in
the
gravest
matters
if
he
has
to
do
with
intelligent
and
educated
men
he
takes
pleasure
in
their
brilliance
if
with
the
ignorant
and
foolish
he
enjoys
their
folly
he
is
not
put
out
by
perfect
fools
and
suits
himself
with
marvellous
dexterity
to
all
feelings
for
women
generally
even
for
his
wife
he
has
nothing
but
jests
and
merriment
you
could
say
he
was
a
second
democritus
or
better
that
pythagorean
philosopher
who
saunters
through
the
with
a
tranquil
mind
gazing
on
the
uproar
of
buyers
and
sellers
none
is
less
guided
by
the
opinion
of
the
herd
but
again
none
is
less
remote
from
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
he
takes
an
especial
pleasure
in
watching
the
appearance
characters
and
behaviour
of
various
creatures
accordingly
there
is
almost
no
kind
of
bird
which
he
does
not
keep
at
his
home
and
various
other
animals
not
commonly
found
such
as
apes
foxes
ferrets
weasels
and
their
like
added
to
this
he
eagerly
buys
anything
foreign
or
otherwise
worth
looking
at
which
comes
his
way
and
he
has
the
whole
house
stocked
with
these
objects
so
that
wherever
the
visitor
looks
there
is
something
to
detain
him
and
his
own
pleasure
is
renewed
whenever
he
sees
others
enjoying
these
sights
when
he
was
of
an
age
for
it
he
was
not
averse
to
with
young
women
but
kept
them
honourable
preferring
the
love
that
was
offered
to
that
which
he
must
chase
after
and
was
more
drawn
by
spiritual
than
by
physical
intercourse
he
had
devoured
classical
literature
from
his
earliest
years
as
a
lad
he
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
greek
literature
and
philosophy
his
father
so
far
from
helping
him
although
he
is
otherwise
a
good
and
sensible
man
deprived
him
of
all
support
in
this
endeavour
and
he
was
almost
regarded
as
disowned
because
he
seemed
to
be
deserting
his
father
studies
the
father
profession
is
english
jurisprudence
this
profession
is
quite
unconnected
with
true
learning
but
in
britain
those
who
have
made
themselves
authorities
in
it
are
particularly
highly
regarded
and
this
is
there
considered
the
most
suitable
road
to
fame
since
most
of
the
nobility
of
that
island
owe
their
origin
to
this
branch
of
study
it
is
said
that
none
can
become
perfect
in
it
without
many
years
of
hard
work
so
although
the
young
man
mind
born
for
better
things
not
unreasonably
revolted
from
it
nevertheless
after
sampling
the
scholastic
disciplines
he
worked
at
the
law
with
such
success
that
none
was
more
gladly
consulted
by
litigants
and
he
made
a
better
living
at
it
than
any
of
those
who
did
nothing
else
so
quick
and
powerful
was
his
intellect
he
also
devoted
much
strenuous
attention
to
studying
the
ecclesiastical
writers
he
lectured
publicly
to
a
crowded
audience
on
augustine
of
while
still
little
more
than
a
lad
and
priests
and
elderly
men
were
neither
sorry
nor
ashamed
to
learn
sacred
matters
from
a
youthful
layman
for
a
time
he
gave
his
whole
mind
to
the
study
of
piety
practising
himself
for
the
priesthood
in
watchings
fastings
and
prayer
and
other
like
preliminary
exercises
in
which
matter
he
was
far
more
sensible
than
most
of
those
who
rashly
hurl
themselves
into
this
arduous
calling
without
having
previously
made
any
trial
of
themselves
the
only
obstacle
to
his
devoting
himself
to
this
mode
of
life
was
his
inability
to
shake
off
his
longing
for
a
wife
he
therefore
chose
to
be
a
chaste
husband
rather
than
an
unchaste
priest
still
he
married
a
girl
as
yet
very
young
of
good
family
but
still
untrained
she
had
always
lived
in
the
country
with
her
parents
and
sisters
so
that
he
could
better
fashion
her
to
his
own
ways
he
had
her
taught
literature
and
made
her
skilled
in
all
kinds
of
music
and
he
had
really
almost
made
her
such
as
he
would
have
cared
to
spend
all
his
life
with
had
not
an
untimely
death
carried
her
off
while
still
a
girl
but
after
she
had
borne
him
several
children
of
whom
there
survive
three
girls
margaret
alice
and
cecily
and
one
boy
john
he
would
not
endure
to
live
long
a
widower
although
his
friends
counselled
otherwise
within
a
few
months
of
his
wife
death
he
married
a
widow
more
for
the
care
of
the
household
than
for
his
pleasure
as
she
was
not
precisely
beautiful
nor
as
he
jokingly
says
himself
a
girl
but
a
keen
and
watchful
housewife
with
whom
he
yet
lives
as
pleasantly
and
agreeably
as
if
she
were
a
most
charming
young
girl
hardly
any
husband
gets
so
much
obedience
from
his
wife
by
stern
orders
as
he
does
by
jests
and
cajolery
how
could
he
fail
to
do
so
after
having
induced
a
woman
on
the
verge
of
old
age
also
by
no
means
a
docile
character
and
lastly
most
attentive
to
her
business
to
learn
to
play
the
cithern
the
lute
the
monochord
and
the
recorders
and
perform
a
daily
prescribed
exercise
in
this

her

wish

xxix
sir
thomas
more
and
his
family
he
rules
his
whole
household
as
agreeably
no
quarrels
or
disturbances
arise
there
if
any
quarrel
does
arise
he
at
once
heals
or
settles
the
difference
and
he
has
never
let
anyone
leave
his
house
in
anger
his
house
seems
blest
indeed
with
a
lucky
fate
for
none
has
lived
there
without
rising
to
better
fortune
and
none
has
ever
acquired
a
stain
on
his
reputation
there
one
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
find
any
agree
as
well
with
their
mothers
as
he
with
his
stepmother
his
father
had
already
given
him
two
and
he
loved
both
of
them
as
truly
as
he
loved
his
mother
recently
his
father
gave
him
a
third
stepmother
more
swears
his
bible
oath
he
has
never
seen
a
better
moreover
he
is
so
disposed
towards
his
parents
and
children
as
to
be
neither
tiresomely
affectionate
nor
ever
failing
in
any
family
duty
he
has
a
mind
altogether
opposed
to
sordid
gain
he
has
put
aside
from
his
fortune
for
his
children
an
amount
which
he
considers
sufficient
for
them
the
rest
he
gives
away
lavishly
while
he
still
made
his
living
at
the
bar
he
gave
sincere
and
friendly
counsel
to
all
considering
his
clients
interests
rather
than
his
own
he
would
persuade
most
of
them
to
settle
their
differences
this
would
be
cheaper
if
he
failed
to
achieve
this
he
would
then
show
them
a
method
of
going
to
law
at
the
least
possible
expense
some
people
here
are
so
minded
that
they
actually
enjoy
litigation
in
the
city
of
london
where
he
was
born
he
acted
for
some
years
as
a
judge
in
civil
causes
this
office
is
not
at
all
onerous
the
court
sits
only
on
thursday
mornings
but
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
honourable
none
dealt
with
so
many
cases
as
he
nor
behaved
with
such
integrity
he
usually
remitted
the
charge
customarily
due
from
litigants
as
before
the
formal
entering
of
the
suit
the
plaintiff
pays
into
court
three
shillings
the
defendant
likewise
and
it
is
incorrect
to
demand
more
by
this
behaviour
he
won
the
deep
affection
of
the
city
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
rest
content
with
this
position
which
was
sufficiently
influential
and
yet
not
exposed
to
grave
dangers
twice
he
was
forced
into
embassies
as
he
acted
in
these
with
great
sagacity
king
henry
viii
would
not
rest
until
he
could
drag
more
to
court
why
not
call
it
no
man
ever
worked
so
assiduously
to
gain
admission
to
the
court
as
he
studied
to
escape
it
but
when
the
king
decided
to
fill
his
household
with
men
of
weight
learning
sagacity
and
integrity
more
was
one
of
the
first
among
many
summoned
by
him
he
regards
more
so
much
as
one
of
his
intimate
circle
that
he
never
lets
him
depart
from
him
if
serious
matters
are
to
be
discussed
there
is
none
more
skilled
than
he
or
if
the
king
decides
to
relax
in
pleasant
gossiping
there
is
no
merrier
companion
often
difficult
affairs
require
a
weighty
and
sagacious
arbitrator
more
solves
these
matters
with
such
success
that
both
parties
are
grateful
yet
no
one
has
ever
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
accept
a
present
from
anyone
how
happy
the
states
would
be
if
the
ruler
everywhere
put
magistrates
like
more
in
office
meanwhile
he
has
acquired
no
trace
of
haughtiness
amid
all
these
official
burdens
he
does
not
forget
his
old
friends
and
from
time
to
time
returns
to
his
beloved
literature
all
the
authority
of
his
office
all
his
influence
with
the
king
is
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
state
and
of
his
friends
his
mind
eager
to
serve
all
and
wondrously
prone
to
pity
has
ever
been
present
to
help
he
will
now
be
better
able
to
help
others
as
he
has
greater
power
some
he
assists
with
money
some
he
protects
with
his
authority
others
he
advances
by
introductions
those
whom
he
can
not
help
otherwise
he
aids
with
counsel
and
he
has
never
sent
anyone
away
disappointed
you
might
call
more
the
common
advocate
of
all
those
in
need
he
regards
himself
as
greatly
enriched
when
he
assists
the
oppressed
extricates
the
perplexed
and
involved
or
reconciles
the
estranged
none
confers
a
benefit
so
gladly
none
is
so
slow
to
upbraid
and
although
he
is
fortunate
on
so
many
counts
and
good
fortune
is
often
associated
with
boastfulness
it
has
never
yet
been
my
lot
to
meet
any
man
so
far
removed
from
this
vice
but
i
must
return
to
recounting
his
studies
it
was
these
which
chiefly
brought
more
and
myself
together
in
his
youth
he
chiefly
practised
verse
composition
afterwards
he
worked
hard
and
long
to
polish
his
prose
practising
his
style
in
all
kinds
of
composition
what
that
style
is
like
i
need
not
describe
particularly
not
to
you
who
always
have
his
books
in
your
hands
he
especially
delighted
in
composing
declamations
and
in
these
liked
paradoxical
themes
for
the
reason
that
this
offers
keener
practice
to
the
wits
this
caused
him
while
still
a
youth
to
compose
a
dialogue
in
which
he
defended
plato
communism
even
to
the
community
of
wives
he
wrote
a
rejoinder
to
in
this
theme
he
desired
to
have
me
as
his
antagonist
to
make
a
surer
trial
of
his
progress
in
this
branch
of
letters
his
was
published
with
the
aim
of
showing
the
causes
of
the
bad
condition
of
states
but
was
chiefly
a
portrait
of
the
british
state
which
he
has
thoroughly
studied
and
explored
he
had
written
the
second
book
first
in
his
leisure
hours
and
added
the
first
book
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
later
when
the
occasion
offered
some
of
the
unevenness
of
the
style
is
due
to
this
one
could
hardly
find
a
better
speaker
a
happy
talent
has
complete
command
of
a
happy
turn
of
speech
he
has
a
present
wit
always
flying
ahead
and
a
ready
memory
and
having
all
this
ready
to
hand
he
can
promptly
and
unhesitatingly
produce
whatever
the
subject
or
occasion
requires
in
arguments
he
is
unimaginably
acute
so
that
he
often
puzzles
the
best
theologians
on
their
own
ground
john
colet
a
man
of
keen
and
exact
judgement
often
observes
in
intimate
conversation
that
britain
has
only
one
genius
although
this
island
is
rich
in
so
many
fine
talents
illustration
xxx
erasmus
at
the
age
of
he
diligently
cultivates
true
piety
while
being
remote
from
all
superstitious
observance
he
has
set
hours
in
which
he
offers
to
god
not
the
customary
prayers
but
prayers
from
the
heart
with
his
friends
he
talks
of
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
so
that
one
sees
that
he
speaks
sincerely
and
not
without
firm
hope
such
is
more
even
in
the
court
and
then
there
are
those
who
think
that
christians
are
to
be
found
only
in
monasteries
there
you
have
a
portrait
not
very
well
drawn
by
a
very
bad
artist
from
a
most
excellent
model
you
will
like
it
less
if
you
happen
to
come
to
know
more
better
but
for
the
time
being
i
have
prevented
your
being
able
to
cast
in
my
teeth
my
failure
to
obey
you
and
always
accusing
me
of
writing
too
short
letters
still
this
did
not
seem
long
to
me
as
i
was
writing
it
and
i
know
that
you
will
not
find
it
long
drawn
out
as
you
read
it
our
friend
more
charm
will
see
to
that
farewell
xvi
to
willibald
pirckheimer
basle
march
to
the
illustrious
willibald
pirckheimer
greetings
i
received
safely
the
very
pretty
ring
which
you
desired
me
to
have
as
a
memento
of
you
i
know
that
gems
are
prized
as
bringing
safety
when
one
has
a
fall
but
they
say
too
that
if
the
fall
was
likely
to
be
fatal
the
evil
is
diverted
on
to
the
gem
so
that
it
is
seen
to
be
broken
after
the
accident
once
in
britain
i
fell
with
my
horse
from
a
fairly
high
bank
no
damage
was
found
to
me
or
my
horse
yet
the
gem
i
was
wearing
was
whole
it
was
a
present
from
alexander
archbishop
of
andrews
whom
i
think
you
know
from
my
writings
when
i
left
him
at
siena
he
drew
it
off
his
finger
and
handing
it
to
me
said
this
as
a
pledge
of
our
friendship
that
will
never
die
and
i
kept
my
pledged
faith
with
him
even
after
his
death
celebrating
my
memory
in
my
writings
there
is
no
part
of
life
into
which
magical
superstition
has
not
insinuated
itself
if
gems
have
some
great
virtue
i
could
have
wished
in
these
days
for
a
ring
with
an
efficacious
remedy
against
tooth
as
to
the
belief
about
falls
i
shall
follow
your
advice
i
shall
prefer
to
believe
rather
than
risk
myself
portraits
are
less
precious
than
jewels
i
have
received
from
you
a
medallic
and
a
painted
portrait
but
at
least
they
bring
my
willibald
more
vividly
before
me
alexander
the
great
would
only
allow
himself
to
be
painted
by
apelles
hand
you
have
found
your
apelles
in
albrecht
dürer
an
artist
of
the
first
rank
and
no
less
to
be
admired
for
his
remarkable
good
sense
if
only
you
had
likewise
found
some
lysippus
to
cast
the
medal
i
have
the
medal
of
you
on
the
righthand
wall
of
my
bedroom
the
painting
on
the
left
whether
writing
or
walking
up
and
down
i
have
willibald
before
my
eyes
so
that
if
i
wanted
to
forget
you
i
could
not
though
i
have
a
more
retentive
memory
for
friends
than
for
anything
else
certainly
willibald
could
not
be
forgotten
by
me
even
were
there
no
memento
no
portraits
no
letters
to
refresh
my
memory
of
him
there
is
another
very
pleasant
thing
the
portraits
often
occasion
a
talk
about
you
when
my
friends
come
to
visit
me
if
only
our
letters
travelled
safely
how
little
we
should
miss
of
each
other
you
have
a
medal
of
me
i
should
not
object
to
having
my
portrait
painted
by
dürer
that
great
artist
but
how
this
can
be
done
i
do
not
see
once
at
brussels
he
sketched
me
but
after
a
start
had
been
made
the
work
was
interrupted
by
callers
from
the
court
though
i
have
long
been
a
sad
model
for
painters
and
am
likely
to
become
a
sadder
one
still
as
the
days
go
on
i
read
with
pleasure
what
you
write
as
witty
as
it
is
wise
on
the
agitations
of
certain
persons
who
are
destroying
the
evangelical
movement
to
which
they
imagine
themselves
to
be
doing
splendid
service
and
i
have
much
to
tell
you
in
my
turn
about
this
but
this
will
be
another
time
when
i
have
more
leisure
farewell
xvii
to
martin
luther
basle
april
to
martin
luther
greetings
your
letter
has
been
delivered
too
late
but
had
it
arrived
in
the
best
of
time
it
would
not
have
moved
me
one
whit
i
am
not
so
simple
as
to
be
appeased
by
one
or
two
pleasantries
or
soothed
by
flattery
after
receiving
so
many
more
than
mortal
wounds
your
nature
is
by
now
known
to
all
the
world
but
you
have
so
tempered
your
pen
that
never
have
you
written
against
anyone
so
frenziedly
nay
what
is
more
abominable
so
maliciously
now
it
occurs
to
you
that
you
are
a
weak
sinner
whereas
at
other
times
you
insist
almost
on
being
taken
for
god
you
are
a
man
as
you
write
of
violent
temperament
and
you
take
pleasure
in
this
remarkable
argument
why
then
did
you
not
pour
forth
this
marvellous
piece
of
invective
on
the
bishop
of
rochester
or
on
cochleus
they
attack
you
personally
and
provoke
you
with
insults
while
my
was
a
courteous
disputation
and
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
subject
all
this
facetious
abuse
these
slanderous
lies
charging
me
with
atheism
epicureanism
scepticism
in
articles
of
the
christian
profession
blasphemy
and
what
not
besides
many
other
points
on
which
i
am
silent
i
take
these
charges
the
less
hardly
because
in
all
this
there
is
nothing
to
make
my
conscience
disturb
me
if
i
did
not
think
as
a
christian
of
god
and
the
holy
scriptures
i
could
not
wish
my
life
prolonged
even
until
tomorrow
if
you
had
conducted
your
case
with
your
usual
vehemence
without
frenzied
abuse
you
would
have
provoked
fewer
men
against
you
as
things
are
you
have
been
pleased
to
fill
more
than
a
third
part
of
the
volume
with
such
abuse
giving
free
rein
to
your
feelings
how
far
you
have
given
way
to
me
the
facts
themselves
show
so
many
palpable
crimes
do
you
fasten
on
me
while
my
was
not
even
intended
to
stir
up
those
matters
which
the
world
itself
knows
of
you
imagine
i
suppose
that
erasmus
has
no
supporters
more
than
you
think
but
it
does
not
matter
what
happens
to
us
two
least
of
all
to
myself
who
must
shortly
go
hence
even
if
the
whole
world
were
applauding
us
it
is
that
distresses
me
and
all
the
best
spirits
with
me
that
with
that
arrogant
impudent
seditious
temperament
of
yours
you
are
shattering
the
whole
globe
in
ruinous
discord
exposing
good
men
and
lovers
of
good
learning
to
certain
frenzied
pharisees
arming
for
revolt
the
wicked
and
the
revolutionary
and
in
short
so
carrying
on
the
cause
of
the
gospel
as
to
throw
all
things
sacred
and
profane
into
chaos
as
if
you
were
eager
to
prevent
this
storm
from
turning
at
last
to
a
happy
issue
i
have
ever
striven
towards
such
an
opportunity
what
you
owe
me
and
in
what
coin
you
have
repaid
me
i
do
not
go
into
that
all
that
is
a
private
matter
it
is
the
public
disaster
which
distresses
me
and
the
irremediable
confusion
of
everything
for
which
we
have
to
thank
only
your
uncontrolled
nature
that
will
not
be
guided
by
the
wise
counsel
of
friends
but
easily
turns
to
any
excess
at
the
prompting
of
certain
inconstant
swindlers
i
know
not
whom
you
have
saved
from
the
power
of
darkness
but
you
should
have
drawn
the
sword
of
your
pen
against
those
ungrateful
wretches
and
not
against
a
temperate
disputation
i
would
have
wished
you
a
better
mind
were
you
not
so
delighted
with
your
own
wish
me
what
you
will
only
not
your
mind
unless
god
has
changed
it
for
you
xviii
to
theophrastus
paracelsus
basle
march
to
the
most
skilled
physician
theophrastus
of
einsiedeln
greetings
it
is
not
incongruous
to
wish
continued
spiritual
health
to
the
medical
man
through
whom
god
gives
us
physical
health
i
wonder
how
you
know
me
so
thoroughly
having
seen
me
once
only
i
recognize
how
very
true
are
your
dark
sayings
not
by
the
art
of
medicine
which
i
have
never
learned
but
from
my
own
wretched
sensations
i
have
felt
pains
in
the
region
of
the
liver
in
the
past
and
could
not
divine
the
source
of
the
trouble
i
have
seen
the
fat
from
the
kidneys
in
my
water
many
years
ago
your
third
point
i
do
not
quite
understand
nevertheless
it
appears
to
be
convincing
as
i
told
you
i
have
no
time
for
the
next
few
days
to
be
doctored
or
to
be
ill
or
to
die
so
overwhelmed
am
i
with
scholarly
work
but
if
there
is
anything
which
can
alleviate
the
trouble
without
weakening
the
body
i
beg
you
to
inform
me
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
explain
at
greater
length
your
very
concise
and
more
than
laconic
notes
and
prescribe
other
remedies
which
i
can
take
until
i
am
free
i
can
not
promise
you
a
fee
to
match
your
art
or
the
trouble
you
have
taken
but
i
do
at
least
promise
you
a
grateful
heart
you
have
resurrected
froben
that
is
my
other
half
if
you
restore
me
also
you
will
have
restored
both
of
us
by
treating
each
of
us
singly
may
we
have
the
good
fortune
to
keep
you
in
basle
i
fear
you
may
not
be
able
to
read
this
letter
dashed
off
immediately
after
receiving
yours
farewell
erasmus
of
rotterdam
by
his
own
hand
xix
to
martin
bucer
basle
november
best
greetings
you
plead
the
cause
of
capito
with
some
rhetorical
skill
but
i
see
that
eloquent
advocate
as
you
are
otherwise
you
are
not
sufficiently
well
equipped
to
undertake
his
defence
were
i
to
advance
my
of
conjectures
and
proofs
you
would
realize
that
you
had
to
devise
a
different
speech
but
i
have
had
too
much
of
squabbling
and
do
not
easily
bestir
myself
against
men
whom
i
once
sincerely
loved
what
the
knight
of
eppendorff
ventures
or
does
not
venture
to
do
is
his
concern
only
that
he
returns
too
frequently
to
this
game
i
shall
not
involve
capito
in
the
drama
unless
he
involves
himself
again
let
him
not
think
me
such
a
fool
as
not
to
know
what
is
in
question
but
i
have
written
myself
on
these
matters
furthermore
as
to
your
pleading
your
own
cause
and
that
of
your
church
i
think
it
better
not
to
give
any
answer
because
this
matter
would
require
a
very
lengthy
oration
even
if
it
were
not
a
matter
of
controversy
this
is
merely
a
brief
answer
on
scattered
points
the
person
who
informed
me
about
is
one
whose
trustworthiness
not
even
you
would
have
esteemed
lightly
and
he
thinks
no
ill
of
you
indeed
i
have
never
disliked
you
as
far
as
concerns
private
feelings
there
are
persons
living
in
your
town
who
were
chattering
here
about
the
disciplines
having
been
invented
by
godforsaken
wretches
certainly
persons
of
this
description
whatever
name
must
be
given
them
are
in
the
ascendancy
everywhere
all
studies
are
neglected
and
come
to
a
standstill
at
nuremberg
the
city
treasury
has
hired
lecturers
but
there
is
no
one
to
attend
their
lectures
you
assemble
a
number
of
conjectures
as
to
why
i
have
not
joined
your
church
but
you
must
know
that
the
first
and
most
important
of
all
the
reasons
which
withheld
me
from
associating
myself
with
it
was
my
conscience
if
my
conscience
could
have
been
persuaded
that
this
movement
proceeded
from
god
i
should
have
been
now
long
since
a
soldier
in
your
camp
the
second
reason
is
that
i
see
many
in
your
group
who
are
strangers
to
all
evangelical
soundness
i
make
no
mention
of
rumours
and
suspicions
i
speak
of
things
learned
from
experience
nay
learned
to
my
own
injury
things
experienced
not
merely
from
the
mob
but
from
men
who
appear
to
be
of
some
worth
not
to
mention
the
leading
men
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
of
what
i
know
not
the
world
is
wide
i
know
some
as
excellent
men
before
they
became
devotees
of
your
faith
what
they
are
now
like
i
do
not
know
at
all
events
i
have
learned
that
several
of
them
have
become
worse
and
none
better
so
far
as
human
judgement
can
discern
the
third
thing
which
deterred
me
is
the
intense
discord
between
the
leaders
of
the
movement
not
to
mention
the
prophets
and
the
anabaptists
what
embittered
pamphlets
zwingli
luther
and
osiander
write
against
each
other
i
have
never
approved
the
ferocity
of
the
leaders
but
it
is
provoked
by
the
behaviour
of
certain
persons
when
they
ought
to
have
made
the
gospel
acceptable
by
holy
and
forbearing
conduct
if
you
really
had
what
you
boast
of
not
to
speak
of
the
others
of
what
use
was
it
for
luther
to
indulge
in
buffoonery
in
that
fashion
against
the
king
of
england
when
he
had
undertaken
a
task
so
arduous
with
the
general
approval
was
he
not
reflecting
as
to
the
role
he
was
sustaining
did
he
not
realize
that
the
whole
world
had
its
eyes
turned
on
him
alone
and
this
is
the
chief
of
this
movement
i
am
not
particularly
angry
with
him
for
treating
me
so
scurrilously
but
his
betrayal
of
the
cause
of
the
gospel
his
letting
loose
princes
bishops
and
against
good
men
his
having
made
doubly
hard
our
slavery
which
is
already
intolerable
that
is
what
tortures
my
mind
and
i
seem
to
see
a
cruel
and
bloody
century
ahead
if
the
provoked
section
gets
its
breath
again
which
it
is
certainly
now
doing
you
will
say
that
there
is
no
crowd
without
an
admixture
of
wicked
men
certainly
it
was
the
duty
of
the
principal
men
to
exercise
special
care
in
matters
of
conduct
and
not
be
even
on
speaking
terms
with
liars
perjurors
drunkards
and
fornicators
as
it
is
i
hear
and
almost
that
things
are
far
otherwise
if
the
husband
had
found
his
wife
more
amenable
the
teacher
his
pupil
more
obedient
the
magistrate
the
citizen
more
tractable
the
employer
his
workman
more
trustworthy
the
buyer
the
seller
less
deceitful
it
would
have
been
great
recommendation
for
the
gospels
as
things
are
the
behaviour
of
certain
persons
has
had
the
effect
of
cooling
the
zeal
of
those
who
at
first
owing
to
their
love
of
piety
and
abhorrence
of
pharisaism
looked
with
favour
on
this
movement
and
the
princes
seeing
a
disorderly
host
springing
up
in
its
wake
made
up
of
vagabonds
fugitives
bankrupts
naked
wretched
and
for
the
most
part
even
wicked
men
are
cursing
even
those
who
in
the
beginning
had
been
hopeful
it
is
not
without
deep
sorrow
that
i
speak
of
all
this
not
only
because
i
foresee
that
a
business
wrongly
handled
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
but
also
because
at
last
i
shall
myself
have
to
suffer
for
it
certain
rascals
say
that
my
writings
are
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
the
scholastic
theologians
and
monks
are
in
several
places
becoming
less
esteemed
than
they
would
like
that
ceremonies
are
neglected
and
that
the
supremacy
of
the
roman
pontiff
is
disregarded
when
it
is
quite
dear
from
what
source
this
evil
has
sprung
they
were
stretching
too
tight
the
rope
which
is
now
breaking
they
almost
set
the
pope
authority
above
christ
they
measured
all
piety
by
ceremonies
and
tightened
the
hold
of
the
confession
to
an
enormous
extent
while
the
monks
lorded
it
without
fear
of
punishment
by
now
meditating
open
tyranny
as
a
result
stretched
string
snapped
as
the
proverb
has
it
it
could
not
be
otherwise
but
i
sorely
fear
that
the
same
will
happen
one
day
to
the
princes
if
they
too
continue
to
stretch
rope
too
tightly
again
the
other
side
having
commenced
the
action
of
their
drama
as
they
did
no
different
ending
was
possible
may
we
not
live
to
see
worse
horrors
however
it
was
the
duty
of
the
leaders
of
this
movement
if
christ
was
their
goal
to
refrain
not
only
from
vice
but
even
from
every
appearance
of
evil
and
to
offer
not
the
slightest
stumbling
block
to
the
gospel
studiously
avoiding
even
practices
which
although
allowed
are
yet
not
expedient
above
all
they
should
have
guarded
against
all
sedition
if
they
had
handled
the
matter
with
sincerity
and
moderation
they
would
have
won
the
support
of
the
princes
and
bishops
for
they
have
not
all
been
given
up
for
lost
and
they
should
not
have
heedlessly
wrecked
anything
without
having
something
better
ready
to
put
in
its
place
as
it
is
those
who
have
abandoned
the
hours
do
not
pray
at
all
many
who
have
put
off
pharisaical
clothing
are
worse
in
other
matters
than
they
were
before
those
who
disdain
the
episcopal
regulations
do
not
even
obey
the
commandments
of
god
those
who
disregard
the
careful
choice
of
foods
indulge
in
greed
and
gluttony
it
is
a
tragedy
which
every
day
we
partly
hear
ourselves
and
partly
learn
of
from
others
i
never
approved
of
the
abolition
of
the
mass
even
though
i
have
always
disliked
these
mean
and
there
were
other
things
also
which
could
have
been
altered
without
causing
riots
as
things
are
certain
persons
are
not
satisfied
with
any
of
the
accepted
practices
as
if
a
new
world
could
be
built
of
a
sudden
there
will
always
be
things
which
the
pious
must
endure
if
anyone
thinks
that
mass
ought
to
be
abolished
because
many
misuse
it
then
the
sermon
should
be
abolished
also
which
is
almost
the
only
custom
accepted
by
your
party
i
feel
the
same
about
the
invocation
of
the
saints
and
about
images
your
letter
demanded
a
lengthy
reply
but
even
this
letter
is
very
long
with
all
that
i
have
to
do
i
am
told
that
you
have
a
splendid
gift
for
preaching
the
word
of
the
gospel
and
that
you
conduct
yourself
more
courteously
than
do
many
so
i
could
wish
that
with
your
good
sense
you
would
strive
to
the
end
that
this
movement
however
it
began
may
through
firmness
and
moderation
in
doctrine
and
integrity
of
conduct
be
brought
to
a
conclusion
worthy
of
the
gospel
to
this
end
i
shall
help
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
as
it
is
although
the
host
of
monks
and
certain
theologians
assail
me
with
all
their
artifices
nothing
will
induce
me
wittingly
to
cast
away
my
soul
you
will
have
the
good
sense
not
to
circulate
this
letter
lest
it
cause
any
disturbance
we
would
have
more
discussions
if
we
could
meet
farewell
i
had
no
time
to
read
this
over
erasmus
of
rotterdam
by
my
own
hand

to

basle
august
to
the
most
illustrious
alfonso
valdes
secretary
to
his
imperial
majesty
greetings
i
have
learned
very
plainly
from
other
men
letters
what
you
indicate
very
discreetly
as
is
your
way
that
there
are
some
who
seek
to
make
the
seal
on
my
ring
an
occasion
for
slander
protesting
that
the
addition
of
the
device
i
yield
to
none
shows
intolerable
arrogance
what
is
this
but
some
fatal
malady
consisting
in
misrepresenting
everything
momus
is
ridiculed
for
criticizing
venus
slipper
but
these
men
outdo
momus
himself
finding
something
to
carp
at
in
a
ring
i
would
have
called
momuses
but
momus
carps
at
nothing
but
what
he
has
first
carefully
inspected
these
or
rather
false
accusers
criticize
with
their
eyes
shut
what
they
neither
see
nor
understand
so
violent
is
the
disease
and
meanwhile
they
think
themselves
pillars
of
the
church
whereas
all
they
do
is
to
expose
their
stupidity
combined
with
a
malice
no
less
extreme
when
they
are
already
more
notorious
than
they
should
be
they
are
dreaming
if
they
think
it
is
erasmus
who
says
but
if
they
read
my
writings
they
would
see
that
there
is
none
so
humble
that
i
rank
myself
above
him
being
more
liable
to
yield
to
all
than
to
none
illustration
xxxii
erasmus
device
now
those
who
know
me
intimately
from
close
association
will
attribute
any
vice
to
me
sooner
than
arrogance
and
will
acknowledge
that
i
am
closer
to
the
socratic
utterance
alone
i
know
that
i
know
nothing
than
to
this
yield
to
none
but
if
they
imagine
that
i
have
so
insolent
a
mind
as
to
put
myself
before
all
others
do
they
also
think
me
such
a
fool
as
to
profess
this
in
a
device
if
they
had
any
christian
feeling
they
would
understand
those
words
either
as
not
mine
or
as
bearing
another
meaning
they
see
there
a
sculptured
figure
in
its
lower
part
a
stone
in
its
upper
part
a
youth
with
flying
hair
does
this
look
like
erasmus
in
any
respect
if
this
is
not
enough
they
see
written
on
the
stone
itself
if
one
takes
this
as
the
last
word
that
will
make
an
iambic
dimeter
acatalectic
nulli
if
one
begins
with
this
word
it
will
be
a
trochaic
dimeter
acatalectic
concedo
what
if
i
had
painted
a
lion
and
added
as
a
device
unless
you
prefer
to
be
torn
to
pieces
would
they
attribute
these
words
to
me
instead
of
the
lion
but
what
they
are
doing
now
is
just
as
foolish
for
if
i
mistake
not
i
am
more
like
a
lion
than
a
stone
they
will
argue
did
not
notice
that
it
was
verse
and
we
know
nothing
about
terminus
is
it
then
to
be
a
crime
henceforward
to
have
written
verse
because
have
not
learned
the
theory
of
metre
at
least
as
they
knew
that
in
devices
of
this
kind
one
actually
aims
at
a
certain
degree
of
obscurity
in
order
to
exercise
the
guessing
powers
of
those
who
look
at
them
if
they
did
not
know
of
terminus
although
they
could
have
learned
of
him
from
the
books
of
augustine
or
ambrose
they
should
have
inquired
of
experts
in
this
kind
of
matter
in
former
times
field
boundaries
were
marked
with
some
sign
this
was
a
stone
projecting
above
the
earth
which
the
laws
of
the
ancients
ordered
never
to
be
moved
here
belongs
the
platonic
utterance
not
what
thou
hast
not
planted
the
law
was
reinforced
by
a
religious
awe
the
better
to
deter
the
ignorant
multitude
from
daring
to
remove
the
stone
by
making
it
believe
that
to
violate
the
stone
was
to
violate
a
god
in
it
whom
the
romans
call
terminus
and
to
him
there
was
also
dedicated
a
shrine
and
a
festival
the
terminalia
this
god
terminus
as
the
roman
historian
has
it
was
alone
in
refusing
to
yield
to
jupiter
because
the
birds
allowed
the
deconsecration
of
all
the
other
sanctuaries
in
the
shrine
of
terminus
alone
they
were
unpropitious
livy
tells
this
story
in
the
first
book
of
his
and
again
in
book
he
narrates
how
after
the
taking
of
auguries
the
capitol
was
being
cleared
juventas
youth
and
terminus
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
moved
this
omen
was
welcomed
with
universal
rejoicing
for
they
believed
that
it
portended
an
eternal
empire
the
is
useful
for
war
and
is
fixed
here
they
will
exclaim
perchance
have
to
do
with
a
mythical
god
he
came
to
me
i
did
not
adopt
him
when
i
was
called
to
rome
and
alexander
titular
archbishop
of
andrews
was
summoned
home
from
siena
by
his
father
king
james
of
scotland
as
a
grateful
and
affectionate
pupil
he
gave
me
several
rings
for
a
memento
of
our
time
together
among
these
was
one
which
had
engraved
on
the
jewel
an
italian
interested
in
antiquities
had
pointed
this
out
which
i
had
not
known
before
i
seized
on
the
omen
and
interpreted
it
as
a
warning
that
the
term
of
my
existence
was
not
far
off
at
that
time
i
was
in
about
my
fortieth
year
to
keep
this
thought
in
my
mind
i
began
to
seal
my
letters
with
this
sign
i
added
the
verse
as
i
said
before
and
so
from
a
heathen
god
i
made
myself
a
device
exhorting
me
to
correct
my
life
for
death
is
truly
a
boundary
which
knows
no
yielding
to
any
but
in
the
medal
there
is
added
in
greek
greek
ora
telos
makrou
biou
that
is
the
end
of
a
long
life
in
latin
ultima
linea
they
will
say
could
have
carved
on
it
a
dead
man
skull
perhaps
i
should
have
accepted
that
if
it
had
come
my
way
but
this
pleased
me
because
it
came
to
me
by
chance
and
then
because
it
had
a
double
charm
for
me
from
the
allusion
to
an
ancient
and
famous
story
and
from
its
obscurity
a
quality
specially
belonging
to
devices
there
is
my
defence
on
or
better
say
on
and
if
only
they
would
at
last
set
a
to
their
misrepresentations
i
will
gladly
come
to
an
agreement
with
them
to
change
my
device
if
they
will
change
their
malady
indeed
by
so
doing
they
would
be
doing
more
for
their
own
authority
which
they
complain
is
being
undermined
by
the
lovers
of
good
learning
i
myself
am
assuredly
so
far
from
desiring
to
injure
their
reputation
that
i
am
deeply
pained
at
their
delivering
themselves
over
to
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
world
by
these
stupid
tricks
and
not
blushing
to
find
themselves
confuted
with
mockery
on
every
occasion
the
lord
keep
you
safe
in
body
and
soul
my
beloved
friend

xxi
to

blount
freiburg

march
to
the
noble
youth
charles
mountjoy
greetings
i
have
determined
to
dedicate
to
you
livy
the
prince
of
latin
history
already
many
times
printed
but
never
before
in
such
a
magnificent
or
accurate
edition
and
if
this
is
not
enough
augmented
by
five
books
recently
discovered
these
were
found
by
some
good
genius
in
the
library
of
the
monastery
at
lorsch
by
simon
grynaeus
a
man
at
once
learned
without
arrogance
in
all
branches
of
literature
and
at
the
same
time
born
for
the
advancement
of
liberal
studies
now
this
monastery
was
built
opposite
worms
or
berbethomagium
by
charlemagne
seven
hundred
years
and
more
ago
and
equipped
with
great
store
of
books
for
this
was
formerly
the
special
care
of
princes
and
this
is
usually
the
most
precious
treasure
of
the
monasteries
the
original
manuscript
was
one
of
marvellous
antiquity
painted
in
the
antique
fashion
with
the
letters
in
a
continuous
series
so
that
it
has
proved
very
difficult
to
separate
word
from
word
unless
one
is
knowledgeable
careful
and
trained
for
this
very
task
this
caused
much
trouble
in
preparing
a
copy
to
be
handed
to
the
printer
men
for
their
use
a
careful
and
faithful
watch
was
kept
to
prevent
any
departure
from
the
original
in
making
the
copy
so
if
the
poor
fragment
which
came
to
us
recently
from
mainz
was
justly
welcomed
by
scholars
with
great
rejoicing
what
acclamation
should
greet
this
large
addition
to
livy
would
to
god
that
this
author
could
be
restored
to
us
complete
and
entire
there
are
rumours
flying
round
that
give
some
hope
of
this
men
boast
of
unpublished
liviana
existing
now
in
denmark
now
in
poland
now
in
germany
at
least
now
that
fortune
has
given
us
these
remnants
against
all
men
expectations
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
despair
of
the
possibility
of
finding
still
more
and
here
in
my
opinion
at
least
the
princes
would
be
acting
worthily
if
they
offered
rewards
and
attracted
scholars
to
the
search
for
such
a
treasure
or
prevailed
upon
them
to
publish
if
there
are
perchance
any
who
are
suppressing
and
hiding
away
to
the
great
detriment
of
studies
something
in
a
fit
state
to
be
of
public
utility
for
it
seems
perfectly
absurd
that
men
will
dig
through
the
bowels
of
the
earth
almost
down
to
hades
at
vast
peril
and
expense
in
order
to
find
a
little
gold
or
silver
and
yet
will
utterly
disregard
treasures
of
this
kind
as
far
above
those
others
in
value
as
the
soul
excels
the
body
and
not
consider
them
worth
searching
for
this
is
the
spirit
of
midases
not
of
princes
and
as
i
know
that
your
character
is
utterly
at
variance
with
this
spirit
i
doubt
not
that
you
will
most
eagerly
welcome
this
great
gain
now
there
are
chiefly
two
considerations
which
remove
all
possible
doubt
as
to
this
being
genuinely
by
livy
in
the
first
place
that
of
the
diction
itself
which
in
all
features
recalls
its
author
secondly
that
of
the
arguments
or
epitomes
of
floras
which
correspond
exactly
with
these
books
and
so
knowing
that
there
is
no
kind
of
reading
more
fitting
for
men
of
note
than
that
of
the
historians
of
whom
livy
is
easily
the
chief
i
speak
of
the
roman
historians
particularly
as
we
have
nothing
of
sallust
beyond
two
fragments
and
bearing
in
mind
what
an
insatiable
glutton
so
to
speak
your
father
has
always
been
for
history
and
i
doubt
not
that
you
resemble
him
in
this
also
i
thought
i
should
not
be
acting
incongruously
in
publishing
these
five
books
with
a
special
dedication
to
you
although
in
this
point
i
should
not
wish
you
to
resemble
your
father
too
closely
he
is
in
the
way
of
poring
over
his
books
every
day
from
dinner
until
midnight
which
is
wearisome
to
his
wife
and
attendants
and
a
cause
of
much
grumbling
among
the
servants
so
far
he
has
been
able
to
do
this
without
loss
of
health
still
i
do
not
think
it
wise
for
you
to
take
the
same
risk
which
may
not
turn
out
as
successfully
certainly
when
your
father
was
studying
along
with
the
present
king
while
still
a
young
man
they
read
chiefly
history
with
the
strong
approval
of
his
father
henry
vii
a
king
of
remarkable
judgement
and
good
sense
joined
to
this
edition
is
the
chronology
of
henry
glareanus
a
man
of
exquisite
and
learning
whose
indefatigable
industry
refines
adorns
and
enriches
with
the
liberal
disciplines
not
the
renowned
gymnasium
at
freiburg
alone
but
this
whole
region
as
well
the
chronology
shows
the
order
of
events
the
details
of
the
wars
and
the
names
of
persons
in
which
up
till
now
there
has
reigned
astonishing
confusion
brought
about
through
the
fault
of
the
scribes
and
dabblers
in
learning
yet
this
was
the
sole
guiding
light
of
history
without
this
pole
star
our
navigation
on
the
ocean
of
history
is
completely
blind
and
without
this
thread
to
help
him
the
reader
becomes
involved
in
an
inextricable
maze
learned
though
he
be
in
these
labyrinths
of
events
if
you
consider
your
letter
well
repaid
by
this
gift
it
will
now
be
your
turn
to
write
me
a
letter
farewell
xxii
to
bartholomew
latomus
basle
august
to
bartholomew
latomus
greetings
in
apologizing
for
your
silence
you
are
wasting
your
time
believe
me
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
judging
tried
friends
by
this
common
courtesy
it
would
be
impudent
of
me
to
charge
you
with
an
omission
which
you
have
an
equal
right
to
accuse
me
of
in
turn
the
heads
of
the
colleges
are
not
doing
anything
new
they
are
afraid
of
their
own
revenues
suffering
this
being
the
sole
aim
of
most
of
them
you
would
scarcely
believe
to
what
machinations
they
stooped
at
louvain
in
their
efforts
to
prevent
a
trilingual
college
being
established
i
worked
strenuously
in
the
matter
and
have
made
myself
accordingly
very
unpopular
there
was
an
attempt
to
set
up
a
chair
of
languages
at
tournai
but
the
university
of
louvain
and
the
franciscans
at
tournai
did
not
rest
until
the
project
was
abandoned
the
house
erected
for
this
purpose
overlooked
the
franciscans
garden
that
was
the
cause
of
the
trouble
i
have
had
a
long
life
counting
in
years
but
were
i
to
calculate
the
time
spent
in
wrestling
with
fever
the
stone
and
the
gout
i
have
not
lived
long
but
we
must
patiently
bear
whatever
the
lord
has
sent
upon
us
whose
will
no
one
can
resist
and
who
alone
knows
what
is
good
for
us
the
glory
of
an
immortal
name
moves
me
not
at
all
i
am
not
anxious
over
the
applause
of
posterity
my
one
concern
and
desire
is
to
depart
hence
with
christ
favour
many
french
nobles
have
fled
here
for
fear
of
the
winter
storm
after
having
been
recalled
lion
shall
roar
who
shall
not
fear
says
the
prophet
a
like
terror
has
seized
the
english
from
an
unlike
cause
certain
monks
have
been
beheaded
and
among
them
a
monk
of
the
order
of
bridget
was
dragged
along
the
ground
then
hanged
and
finally
drawn
and
quartered
there
is
a
firm
and
probable
rumour
here
that
the
news
of
the
bishop
of
rochester
having
been
by
paul
iii
as
a
cardinal
caused
the
king
to
hasten
his
being
dragged
out
of
prison
and
beheaded
his
method
of
conferring
the
scarlet
hat
it
is
all
too
true
that
thomas
more
has
been
long
in
prison
and
his
fortune
confiscated
it
was
being
said
that
he
too
had
been
executed
but
i
have
no
certain
news
as
yet
would
that
he
had
never
embroiled
himself
in
this
perilous
business
and
had
left
the
theological
cause
to
the
theologians
the
other
friends
who
from
time
to
time
honoured
me
with
letters
and
gifts
now
send
nothing
and
write
nothing
from
fear
and
accept
nothing
from
anyone
as
if
under
every
stone
there
slept
a
scorpion
it
seems
that
the
pope
is
seriously
thinking
of
a
council
here
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
to
meet
in
the
midst
of
such
dissension
between
princes
and
lands
the
whole
of
lower
germany
is
astonishingly
infected
with
anabaptists
in
upper
germany
they
pretend
not
to
notice
them
they
are
pouring
in
here
in
droves
some
are
on
their
way
to
italy
the
emperor
is
besieging
goletta
in
my
opinion
there
is
more
danger
from
the
anabaptists
i
do
not
think
that
france
is
entirely
free
of
this
plague
but
they
are
silent
there
for
fear
of
the
cudgel
now
i
must
tell
you
something
about
my
position
which
will
amuse
you
i
had
written
to
paul
iii
at
the
instance
of
louis
ber
the
distinguished
theologian
before
unsealing
the
letter
he
spoke
of
me
with
great
respect
and
as
he
had
to
make
several
scholars
cardinals
for
the
coming
council
the
name
of
erasmus
was
proposed
among
others
but
obstacles
were
mentioned
my
health
not
strong
enough
for
the
duties
and
my
low
income
for
they
say
there
is
a
decree
which
excludes
from
this
office
those
whose
annual
income
is
less
than
ducats
now
they
are
busy
heaping
benefices
on
me
so
that
i
can
acquire
the
proper
income
from
these
and
receive
the
red
hat
the
proverbial
cat
in
i
have
a
friend
in
rome
who
is
particularly
active
in
the
business
in
vain
have
i
warned
him
more
than
once
by
letter
that
i
want
no
cures
or
pensions
that
i
am
a
man
who
lives
from
day
to
day
and
every
day
expecting
death
often
longing
for
it
so
horrible
sometimes
are
the
pains
it
is
hardly
safe
for
me
to
put
a
foot
outside
my
bedroom
and
even
the
merest
trifle
upsets
me
with
my
peculiar
emaciated
body
i
can
only
stand
warm
air
and
in
this
condition
they
want
to
push
me
forward
as
a
candidate
for
benefices
and
cardinals
hats
but
meanwhile
i
am
gratified
by
the
supreme
pontiff
delusions
about
me
and
his
feelings
towards
me
but
i
am
being
more
wordy
than
i
intended
i
should
easily
forgive
your
somewhat
lengthy
letter
if
you
were
to
repeat

fault
