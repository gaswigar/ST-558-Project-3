murder
in
the
gunroom
by
beam
piper
new
york
first
edition
to
henry
an
old
and
valued
friend
who
was
promised
this
dedication
with
an
entirely
different
novel
in
mind
years
ago
preface
lane
fleming
collection
of
early
pistols
and
revolvers
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
when
fleming
was
found
dead
on
the
floor
of
his
locked
gunroom
a
percussion
revolver
in
his
hand
the
coroner
verdict
was
death
by
accident
but
gladys
fleming
had
her
doubts
enough
at
any
rate
to
engage
colonel
jefferson
davis
rand
better
known
just
as
jeff
private
detective
and
a
himself
to
catalogue
appraise
and
negotiate
the
sale
of
her
late
husband
collection
there
were
a
number
of
people
who
had
wanted
the
collection
the
question
was
had
anyone
wanted
it
badly
enough
to
kill
fleming
and
if
so
how
had
he
done
it
here
is
a
mystery
told
against
the
fascinating
background
of
old
guns
and
which
is
without
being
hysterical
exciting
without
losing
its
contact
with
reason
and
which
introduces
a
personable
and
intelligent
new
private
detective
it
is
a
story
that
will
keep
your
nerves
on
a
hair
trigger
even
if
you
know
the
difference
between
a
cased
pair
of
paterson
and
a
texas
with
a
chapter
it
was
hard
to
judge
jeff
rand
age
from
his
appearance
he
was
certainly
over
thirty
and
considerably
under
fifty
he
looked
hard
and
fit
like
a
man
who
could
be
a
serviceable
friend
or
a
particularly
unpleasant
enemy
women
instinctively
suspected
that
he
would
make
a
most
satisfying
lover
one
might
have
taken
him
for
a
successful
lawyer
he
had
studied
law
years
ago
or
a
military
officer
in
mufti
he
still
had
a
reserve
colonelcy
and
used
the
title
occasionally
to
impress
people
who
he
thought
needed
impressing
or
a
prosperous
businessman
as
he
usually
thought
of
himself
most
of
all
he
looked
like
king
charles
ii
of
england
anachronistically
clad
in
a
brooks
brothers
suit
at
the
moment
he
was
looking
rather
like
king
charles
ii
being
bothered
by
one
of
his
mistresses
who
wanted
a
peerage
for
her
husband
but
fleming
he
was
expostulating
there
surely
must
be
somebody
else
after
all
you
have
to
admit
that
this
is
the
sort
of
work
this
agency
handles
the
client
released
a
series
of
and
watched
them
float
up
toward
the
at
the
office
ceiling
it
spoke
well
for
rand
ability
to
subordinate
esthetic
to
business
considerations
that
he
was
trying
to
give
her
a
courteous
and
humane
she
made
even
the
petty
and
varga
girls
seem
credible
her
was
blue
and
gold
blue
eyes
and
a
blue
tailored
outfit
that
would
have
looked
severe
on
a
less
curvate
figure
and
a
charmingly
absurd
little
blue
hat
perched
on
a
mass
of
golden
hair
if
rand
had
been
charles
ii
she
could
have
walked
out
of
there
with
a
duchess
coronet
and
nell
gwyn
would
have
been
back
selling
oranges
why
is
it
she
countered
your
door
marked
detective
agency
jefferson
davis
rand
investigation
and
well
i
want
to
know
how
much
the
collection
worth
and
who
pay
the
closest
to
it
that
investigation
is
it
and
i
want
protection
from
being
swindled
and
do
tell
me
you
ca
do
it
you
a
yourself
you
have
one
of
the
best
small
collections
in
the
state
and
you
a
recognized
authority
on
early
pistols
i
read
some
of
your
articles
in
the
if
you
ca
handle
this
i
do
know
who
can
rand
frown
deepened
he
wondered
how
much
gladys
fleming
knew
about
the
principles
of
general
semantics
even
if
she
did
know
anything
she
was
still
edging
him
into
an
untenable
position
he
hastily
shifted
from
the
attempt
to
identify
his
business
with
the
label
private
detective
agency
well
here
fleming
he
explained
my
business
including
and
service
and
general
investigation
and
protection
work
requires
some
personal
supervision
but
none
of
it
demands
my
exclusive
attention
now
if
you
wanted
some
routine
investigation
made
i
could
turn
it
over
to
my
staff
maybe
put
two
or
three
men
to
work
on
it
but
there
nothing
about
this
business
of
yours
that
i
could
delegate
to
anybody
i
have
to
do
it
all
myself
at
the
expense
of
neglecting
the
rest
of
my
business
now
i
could
do
what
you
want
done
but
it
would
cost
you
three
or
four
times
what
you
gain
by
retaining
me
well
let
me
decide
that
colonel
she
replied
how
much
would
you
have
to
have
well
this
collection
of
your
late
husband
consists
of
some
hundred
pistols
and
revolvers
all
types
and
periods
rand
said
you
want
me
to
catalogue
it
appraise
each
item
issue
lists
and
negotiate
with
prospective
buyers
the
cataloguing
and
appraisal
alone
would
take
from
a
week
to
ten
days
and
it
would
be
a
couple
more
weeks
until
a
satisfactory
sale
could
be
arranged
why
say
five
thousand
dollars
a
thousand
as
a
retainer
and
the
rest
on
completion
that
he
thought
would
settle
that
he
was
expecting
an
indignant
outcry
and
hardened
his
heart
like
pharaoh
instead
gladys
fleming
nodded
equably
that
seems
reasonable
enough
colonel
rand
considering
that
you
have
to
be
staying
with
us
at
rosemont
away
from
your
office
she
agreed
i
give
you
a
check
for
the
thousand
now
with
a
letter
of
authorization
rand
nodded
in
return
being
thoroughly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
could
only
know
a
thin
film
of
the
events
on
the
surface
of
any
situation
he
was
not
easily
surprised
very
well
he
said
you
hired
an
i
be
in
rosemont
some
time
tomorrow
afternoon
now
who
are
these
prospective
purchasers
you
mentioned
and
just
how
prospective
in
terms
of
united
states
currency
are
they
well
for
one
there
arnold
rivers
he
offering
ten
thousand
for
the
collection
i
suppose
you
know
of
him
he
has
an
business
at
rosemont
i
done
some
business
with
him
rand
admitted
who
else
there
a
named
carl
gwinnett
who
wants
to
handle
the
collection
for
us
for
twenty
per
cent
i
told
that
that
is
an
unusually
exorbitant
commission
but
i
not
exactly
crazy
about
the
idea
you
should
be
if
you
want
your
money
in
a
hurry
rand
told
her
he
take
at
least
five
years
to
get
everything
sold
he
would
dump
the
whole
collection
on
the
market
at
once
upset
prices
and
spoil
his
future
business
you
know
two
thousand
five
hundred
pistols
of
the
sort
fleming
had
coming
on
the
market
in
a
lot
could
do
just
that
the
market
is
so
large
that
it
could
be
easily
saturated
that
what
i
been
thinking
and
then
there
are
some
private
collectors
mostly
friends
of
lane
fleming
who
are
talking
about
forming
a
pool
to
buy
the
collection
for
distribution
among
themselves
she
continued
that
more
like
it
rand
approved
if
they
can
raise
enough
money
among
them
that
is
they
wo
want
the
stuff
for
resale
and
they
may
pay
something
resembling
a
decent
price
who
are
they
well
stephen
gresham
appears
to
be
the
leading
spirit
she
said
the
corporation
lawyer
you
know
then
there
is
a
trehearne
and
a
macbride
and
philip
cabot
and
one
or
two
others
i
know
gresham
and
cabot
rand
said
they
both
friends
of
mine
and
i
have
an
account
with
cabot
joyner
teale
cabot
brokerage
firm
i
corresponded
with
macbride
he
specializes
in
colts
you
the
sole
owner
i
take
it
well
no
she
paused
picking
her
words
carefully
we
may
just
run
into
a
little
trouble
there
you
see
the
collection
is
part
of
the
residue
of
the
estate
left
equally
to
myself
and
my
two
stepdaughters
nelda
dunmore
and
geraldine
varcek
you
understand
fleming
and
i
were
married
in
his
first
wife
died
fifteen
years
before
well
your
stepdaughters
now
would
they
also
be
my
clients
good
lord
no
that
amused
her
considerably
more
than
it
did
rand
of
course
she
continued
they
just
as
interested
in
selling
the
collection
for
the
best
possible
price
but
beyond
that
there
may
be
a
slight
divergence
of
opinion
for
instance
nelda
husband
fred
dunmore
has
been
insisting
that
we
let
him
handle
the
sale
of
the
pistols
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
something
he
calls
a
businessman
nelda
supports
him
in
this
it
was
fred
who
got
this
offer
from
rivers
personally
i
think
rivers
is
playing
him
for
a
sucker
outside
his
own
line
fred
is
an
awful
innocent
and
i
never
trusted
this
man
rivers
lane
had
some
trouble
with
him
just
before
arnold
rivers
rand
said
when
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
going
to
continue
has
the
reputation
among
collectors
of
being
the
biggest
crook
in
the
racket
a
reputation
he
seems
determined
to
live
up
or
down
to
but
here
if
your
stepdaughters
are
my
status
what
authority
if
any
have
i
to
do
any
negotiating
gladys
fleming
laughed
musically
that
my
dear
colonel
is
where
you
earn
your
fee
she
told
him
actually
it
wo
be
as
hard
as
it
looks
if
nelda
gives
you
any
argument
you
can
count
on
geraldine
to
take
your
side
as
a
matter
of
principle
if
geraldine
objects
first
nelda
will
help
you
her
into
line
fred
dunmore
is
accustomed
to
dealing
with
a
lot
of
at
the
plant
you
should
have
any
trouble
shouting
him
down
anton
varcek
wo
be
interested
one
way
or
another
he
has
what
amounts
to
a
pathological
phobia
about
firearms
of
any
sort
and
humphrey
goode
our
attorney
who
executor
of
the
estate
will
welcome
you
with
open
arms
once
he
finds
out
what
you
want
to
do
that
collection
has
him
talking
to
himself
already
look
if
you
come
out
to
our
happy
home
in
the
early
afternoon
before
fred
and
anton
get
back
from
the
plant
we
ought
to
ram
through
some
sort
of
agreement
with
geraldine
and
nelda
you
and
whoever
else
sides
with
me
will
be
a
majority
rand
considered
of
course
the
other
one
may
pull
a
gromyko
on
us
but
i
think
talk
to
goode
first
yes
that
would
be
smart
gladys
fleming
agreed
after
all
responsible
for
selling
the
collection
she
crossed
to
the
desk
and
sat
down
in
rand
chair
while
she
wrote
out
the
check
and
a
short
letter
of
authorization
then
she
returned
to
her
own
seat
there
another
thing
she
continued
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
because
of
the
manner
of
fleming
death
the
girls
have
a
horror
of
the
collection
almost
but
not
quite
as
strong
as
their
desire
to
get
the
best
possible
price
for
it
yes
i
heard
that
fleming
had
been
killed
in
a
firearms
accident
last
november
rand
mentioned
it
was
with
one
of
his
the
widow
replied
one
he
bought
just
that
day
a
percussion
revolver
he
brought
it
home
with
him
simply
delighted
with
it
and
started
cleaning
it
at
once
he
could
hardly
wait
until
dinner
was
over
to
get
back
to
work
on
it
we
finished
dinner
about
seven
or
a
little
after
at
about
nelda
went
out
somewhere
in
the
coupé
anton
had
gone
up
to
his
laboratory
in
the
attic
he
one
of
these
fortunates
whose
work
is
also
his
hobby
he
a
biochemist
and
dietitian
and
lane
was
in
the
gunroom
on
the
second
floor
working
on
his
new
revolver
fred
dunmore
was
having
a
bath
and
geraldine
and
i
had
taken
our
coffee
into
the
east
parlor
geraldine
put
on
the
radio
and
we
were
listening
to
it
it
must
have
been
about
or
because
the
program
had
changed
and
the
first
commercial
was
just
over
when
we
heard
a
loud
noise
from
somewhere
upstairs
neither
of
us
thought
of
a
shot
my
own
first
idea
was
of
a
door
slamming
then
about
five
minutes
later
we
heard
anton
in
the
upstairs
hall
pounding
on
a
door
and
shouting
lane
are
you
all
right
we
ran
up
the
front
stairway
and
found
anton
in
his
rubber
and
fred
in
a
bathrobe
and
barefooted
standing
outside
the
gunroom
door
the
door
was
locked
and
that
in
itself
was
unusual
there
a
yale
lock
on
it
but
nobody
ever
used
it
for
a
minute
or
so
we
just
stood
there
anton
was
explaining
that
he
had
heard
a
shot
and
that
nobody
in
the
gunroom
answered
geraldine
told
him
rather
impatiently
to
go
down
to
the
library
and
up
the
spiral
you
see
she
explained
the
library
is
directly
under
the
gunroom
and
there
a
spiral
stairway
connecting
the
two
rooms
so
anton
went
downstairs
and
we
stood
waiting
in
the
hall
fred
was
shivering
in
his
bathrobe
he
said
he
just
jumped
out
of
the
bathtub
and
he
had
nothing
on
under
it
after
a
while
anton
opened
the
gunroom
door
from
the
inside
and
stood
in
the
doorway
blocking
it
he
said
better
not
come
in
there
been
an
accident
but
it
too
late
to
do
anything
lane
shot
himself
with
one
of
those
damned
pistols
i
always
knew
something
like
this
would
happen
well
i
simply
elbowed
him
out
of
the
way
and
went
in
and
the
others
followed
me
by
this
time
the
uproar
had
penetrated
to
the
rear
of
the
house
and
the
servants
walters
the
butler
and
horder
the
cook
had
joined
us
we
found
lane
inside
lying
on
the
floor
shot
through
the
forehead
of
course
he
was
dead
he
been
sitting
on
one
of
these
old
cobblers
benches
of
the
sort
that
used
to
be
all
the
thing
for
he
had
his
tools
and
polish
and
oil
and
rags
on
it
fallen
off
it
to
one
side
and
was
lying
beside
it
he
had
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
and
an
oily
rag
in
his
left
was
it
the
revolver
he
brought
home
with
him
rand
asked
i
do
know
she
replied
he
showed
me
this
confederate
revolver
when
he
came
home
but
it
was
dirty
and
dusty
and
i
did
touch
it
and
i
did
look
closely
at
the
one
he
had
in
his
hand
when
he
was
on
the
floor
it
was
about
the
same
size
and
design
that
all
i
could
swear
to
she
continued
we
had
something
of
an
argument
about
what
to
do
walters
the
butler
offered
to
call
the
police
he
english
and
his
mind
seems
to
run
naturally
to
due
process
of
law
fred
and
anton
both
howled
that
proposal
down
they
wanted
no
part
of
the
police
at
the
same
time
geraldine
was
going
into
hysterics
and
i
was
trying
to
get
her
quieted
down
i
took
her
to
her
room
and
gave
her
a
couple
of
and
then
went
back
to
the
gunroom
while
i
was
gone
it
seems
that
anton
had
called
our
family
doctor
yardman
and
then
fred
called
humphrey
goode
our
lawyer
goode
lives
next
door
to
us
about
two
hundred
yards
away
so
he
arrived
almost
at
once
when
the
doctor
came
he
called
the
coroner
and
when
he
arrived
about
an
hour
later
they
all
went
into
a
huddle
and
decided
that
it
was
an
obvious
accident
and
that
no
inquest
would
be
necessary
then
somebody
i
not
sure
who
called
an
undertaker
it
was
past
eleven
when
he
arrived
and
for
once
nelda
got
home
early
she
was
just
coming
in
while
they
were
carrying
lane
out
in
a
basket
you
can
imagine
how
horrible
that
was
for
her
it
was
days
before
she
was
over
the
shock
so
she
be
just
as
glad
as
anybody
to
see
the
last
of
the
through
the
recital
rand
had
sat
silently
toying
with
the
italian
fascist
that
was
doing
duty
as
a
on
his
desk
gladys
fleming
was
he
was
sure
indulging
in
any
masochistic
neither
he
thought
was
she
talking
to
relieve
her
mind
once
or
twice
there
had
been
a
small
catch
in
her
voice
but
otherwise
the
narration
had
been
a
piece
of
straight
reporting
neither
callous
nor
emotional
good
reporting
too
carefully
detailed
there
had
been
one
or
two
inclusions
of
inferential
matter
in
the
guise
of
description
but
that
was
to
be
looked
for
and
discounted
and
she
had
remembered
at
the
end
to
include
her
ostensible
reason
for
telling
the
story
yes
it
must
have
been
dreadful
he
sympathized
odd
though
that
an
old
hand
with
guns
like
fleming
would
have
an
accident
like
that
i
met
him
once
or
twice
and
was
at
your
home
to
see
his
collection
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
impressed
me
as
knowing
firearms
pretty
thoroughly
well
you
can
look
for
me
tomorrow
say
around
two
in
the
meantime
i
see
goode
and
also
gresham
and
arnold
rivers
chapter
after
ushering
his
client
out
the
hall
door
and
closing
it
behind
her
rand
turned
and
said
all
right
kathie
or
dave
whoever
out
there
come
on
in
then
he
went
to
his
desk
and
reached
under
it
snapping
off
a
switch
as
he
straightened
the
door
from
the
opened
and
his
secretary
kathie
entered
loading
a
cigarette
into
an
amber
holder
she
was
a
handsome
woman
built
on
the
generous
lines
of
a
renaissance
goddess
none
of
the
renaissance
masters
however
had
ever
employed
a
model
so
strikingly
hibernian
she
had
blue
eyes
and
a
fair
complexion
she
wore
green
which
went
well
with
her
flaming
red
hair
and
a
good
deal
of
gold
behind
her
came
dave
ritter
he
was
rand
assistant
and
also
lover
he
was
five
or
six
years
older
than
his
employer
and
slightly
built
his
hair
fighting
a
stubborn
rearguard
action
against
baldness
was
an
indeterminate
mousy
it
was
one
of
his
professional
assets
that
nobody
ever
noticed
him
not
even
in
a
crowd
of
one
when
he
wanted
it
to
his
thin
face
could
assume
the
weary
baffled
expression
of
a
with
a
wife
and
four
children
on
fifty
dollars
a
week
actually
he
drew
three
times
that
much
had
no
wife
admitted
to
no
children
during
the
war
he
and
kathie
had
kept
the
agency
in
something
better
than
a
state
of
suspended
animation
while
rand
had
been
in
the
army
ritter
fumbled
a
camel
out
of
his
shirt
pocket
and
made
a
beeline
for
the
desk
appropriating
rand
lighter
and
sharing
the
flame
with
kathie
you
know
jeff
he
said
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
agency
never
made
any
money
while
you
were
away
was
that
i
never
had
the
unadulterated
insolence
to
ask
the
kind
of
fees
you
do
i
was
listening
in
on
the
extension
in
the
i
could
hear
kathie
damn
near
faint
when
you
said
five
grand
yes
five
thousand
dollars
for
appraising
a
collection
they
been
offered
ten
for
and
she
only
has
a
kathie
said
retracting
herself
into
the
chair
lately
vacated
by
gladys
fleming
if
that
makes
sense
now
ah
do
you
get
it
kathleen
mavourneen
ritter
asked
she
care
about
the
pistols
she
wants
jeff
to
find
out
who
fixed
up
that
accident
for
fleming
you
heard
that
big
long
story
about
exactly
what
happened
and
where
everybody
was
supposed
to
have
been
at
the
time
i
hope
you
got
all
that
recorded
it
was
all
told
for
a
purpose
rand
had
picked
up
the
outside
phone
and
was
dialing
in
a
moment
a
girl
voice
answered
carter
tipton
good
afternoon
hello
rheba
is
tip
available
oh
hello
jeff
just
a
sec
i
see
she
buzzed
another
phone
jeff
rand
on
the
line
she
announced
a
clear
slightly
male
voice
took
over
hello
jeff
now
what
sort
of
malfeasance
have
you
committed
nothing
so
far
cross
my
fingers
rand
replied
i
just
want
a
little
information
are
you
busy
okay
i
be
up
directly
he
replaced
the
phone
and
turned
to
his
disciples
our
client
he
said
wants
two
jobs
done
on
one
fee
getting
the
sold
is
one
job
exploring
the
whys
and
wherefores
of
that
quote
accident
unquote
is
the
other
she
has
a
hunch
and
probably
nothing
much
better
that
there
something
sour
about
the
accident
she
expects
me
to
find
evidence
to
that
effect
while
i
at
rosemont
going
over
the
collection
i
not
excluding
other
possibilities
but
i
work
on
that
line
until
and
unless
i
find
out
differently
five
thousand
should
cover
both
jobs
you
think
that
how
it
is
kathie
asked
look
kathie
i
got
just
as
far
in
arithmetic
at
school
as
you
did
and
i
suspect
that
fleming
got
at
least
as
far
as
long
division
herself
for
reasons
i
stated
i
simply
could
have
handled
that
collection
business
for
anything
like
a
reasonable
fee
so
i
told
her
five
thousand
thinking
that
would
stop
her
when
it
did
i
knew
she
had
something
else
in
mind
and
when
she
went
into
all
that
detail
about
the
death
of
her
husband
she
as
good
as
told
me
that
was
what
it
was
now
i
sorry
i
did
say
ten
thousand
i
think
she
have
bought
it
at
that
price
just
as
cheerfully
she
thinks
lane
fleming
was
murdered
well
on
the
face
of
what
she
told
me
so
do
i
all
right
professor
expound
ritter
said
you
heard
what
he
was
supposed
to
have
shot
himself
with
rand
began
a
percussion
revolver
you
know
what
they
like
and
i
know
enough
about
lane
fleming
to
know
how
much
experience
he
had
with
old
arms
i
ca
believe
that
he
buy
a
pistol
without
carefully
examining
it
and
i
ca
believe
that
he
bring
that
thing
home
and
start
working
on
it
without
seeing
the
caps
on
the
nipples
and
the
charges
in
the
chambers
if
it
had
been
loaded
and
if
it
had
been
he
would
have
first
taken
off
the
caps
and
then
taken
it
apart
and
drawn
the
charges
and
she
says
he
started
working
on
it
as
soon
as
he
got
home
presumably
around
five
and
then
took
time
out
for
dinner
and
then
went
back
to
work
on
it
and
more
than
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
shot
and
he
was
killed
rand
blew
a
bronx
cheer
if
that
accident
had
been
the
mccoy
it
would
have
happened
in
the
first
five
minutes
after
he
started
working
on
that
pistol
no
in
the
first
thirty
seconds
and
then
when
they
found
him
he
had
the
revolver
in
his
right
hand
and
an
oily
rag
in
his
left
i
hope
both
of
you
noticed
that
little
touch
yeah
when
i
clean
a
gat
i
generally
have
it
in
my
left
hand
and
clean
with
my
right
ritter
said
exactly
and
why
do
you
use
an
oily
rag
rand
inquired
ritter
looked
at
him
blankly
for
a
then
grinned
ruefully
damn
i
never
thought
of
that
he
admitted
okay
he
was
bumped
off
all
right
but
you
use
oily
rags
on
guns
kathie
objected
i
seen
both
of
you
often
enough
when
we
all
through
honey
ritter
told
her
yes
when
he
brought
home
that
revolver
it
was
in
neglected
condition
rand
said
either
or
filthy
with
gummed
oil
and
dirt
even
if
fleming
had
mentioned
that
point
the
length
of
time
he
spent
cleaning
it
would
justify
such
an
inference
he
would
have
taken
it
apart
down
to
the
smallest
screw
and
cleaned
everything
carefully
and
then
put
it
together
again
and
then
when
he
had
finished
he
would
have
gone
over
the
surface
with
an
oiled
rag
before
hanging
it
on
the
wall
he
would
certainly
not
have
it
before
removing
the
charges
if
there
ever
were
any
i
assume
the
revolver
he
was
found
holding
presumably
the
one
with
which
he
was
killed
was
another
one
and
i
would
further
assume
that
the
killer
was
particularly
familiar
with
the
subject
of
firearms
antique
care
and
maintenance
of
and
with
all
the
hollering
and
whooping
and
nobody
noticed
the
switch
ritter
finished
wonder
what
happened
to
the
one
he
was
really
cleaning
that
i
may
possibly
find
out
rand
said
the
general
incompetence
with
which
this
murder
was
committed
gives
me
plenty
of
room
to
hope
that
it
may
still
be
lying
around
somewhere
well
have
you
thought
that
it
might
just
be
suicide
kathie
asked
i
have
very
briefly
i
dismissed
the
thought
almost
at
once
rand
told
her
for
two
reasons
one
that
if
it
had
been
suicide
fleming
would
want
it
poked
into
she
be
more
than
willing
to
let
it
ride
as
an
accident
and
two
i
doubt
if
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
his
as
fleming
did
would
want
his
to
be
taken
for
an
accident
i
damn
sure
i
would
want
my
friends
to
go
around
saying
a
dope
did
know
it
was
loaded
i
doubt
if
he
even
expect
people
to
believe
that
it
had
been
an
accident
he
shook
his
head
no
the
only
inference
i
can
draw
is
that
somebody
murdered
fleming
and
then
faked
evidence
intended
to
indicate
an
accident
he
rose
i
be
back
in
a
little
think
it
over
while
i
gone
carter
tipton
had
his
on
the
floor
above
the
detective
agency
he
handled
all
rand
not
infrequent
legal
involvements
and
rand
did
all
his
investigating
and
annually
they
compared
books
to
see
who
owed
whom
how
much
tipton
was
about
five
years
rand
junior
and
had
been
in
the
navy
during
the
war
he
was
frequently
described
as
new
belfast
leading
younger
attorney
and
most
eligible
bachelor
his
dark
conservatively
cut
clothes
fitted
him
as
though
they
had
been
sprayed
on
he
wore
glasses
and
he
was
so
freshly
barbered
manicured
valeted
and
scrubbed
as
to
give
the
impression
that
he
had
been
born
in
cellophane
and
just
unwrapped
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
waved
his
visitor
to
a
seat
tip
do
you
know
anything
about
this
fleming
family
out
at
rosemont
rand
began
getting
out
his
pipe
and
tobacco
the
flemings
tipton
asked
yes
a
little
which
one
of
them
wants
you
to
frame
what
on
which
other
one
that
do
for
a
good
simplified
description
to
start
with
rand
commented
why
my
client
is
gladys
fleming
as
to
what
she
wants
he
told
the
young
lawyer
about
his
recent
interview
and
subsequent
conclusions
so
you
see
he
finished
she
wo
commit
herself
even
with
me
maybe
she
thinks
i
have
more
official
status
and
more
obligations
to
the
police
than
i
have
maybe
she
is
sure
in
her
own
mind
and
wants
me
to
see
independently
if
there
any
smell
of
something
dead
in
the
woodpile
or
she
may
think
that
having
a
private
detective
called
in
may
throw
a
scare
into
somebody
or
maybe
she
thinks
somebody
may
be
fixing
up
an
accident
for
her
next
and
she
wants
a
gent
in
the
house
for
a
while
or
any
combination
thereof
personally
i
deplore
these
clients
who
hire
you
to
do
one
thing
and
expect
you
to
do
another
but
with
five
grand
for
sweetening
i
can
take
them
yes
you
know
i
heard
rumors
of
suicide
but
this
is
the
first
whiff
of
murder
i
caught
he
hesitated
slightly
i
must
say
i
not
greatly
surprised
lane
fleming
death
was
very
convenient
to
a
number
of
people
you
know
about
this
premix
company
do
you
vaguely
they
manufacture
pancake
flour
and
and
pudding
powders
and
this
dehydrated
vegetable
soup
pour
on
hot
water
stir
and
serve
do
they
my
colored
boy
buck
got
some
of
the
soup
once
for
an
experiment
we
unanimously
voted
not
to
try
it
again
they
put
out
quite
a
line
of
such
godsends
to
the
neophyte
in
the
kitchen
the
popularity
of
which
is
reflected
in
a
steadily
rising
tipton
said
they
advertise
very
extensively
including
half
an
hour
of
drama
on
a
national
hookup
during
time
your
client
the
former
gladys
farrand
was
on
the
air
for
premix
for
a
couple
of
years
that
how
lane
fleming
first
met
her
so
you
think
some
irate
and
dyspeptic
husband
went
to
the
source
of
his
woes
rand
inquired
well
not
exactly
you
see
premix
is
only
little
business
as
the
foods
industry
goes
but
they
have
something
very
sweet
so
sweet
in
fact
that
one
of
the
really
big
fellows
national
milling
packaging
has
been
going
to
rather
extreme
lengths
to
effect
a
merger
par
is
quoted
at
around
and
premix
par
is
at
now
and
is
offering
a
exchange
which
would
be
a
little
less
than
in
value
i
might
add
for
what
it
worth
that
this
stephen
gresham
you
mentioned
is
attorney
negotiator
and
general
fixit
he
has
been
trying
to
put
over
this
merger
for
i
bear
that
in
mind
too
rand
said
naturally
all
this
is
not
being
shouted
from
the
housetops
tipton
continued
fact
is
it
a
minor
infraction
of
ethics
for
me
to
mention
it
to
you
i
file
it
in
the
rand
promised
what
was
the
matter
did
premix
want
to
merge
lane
fleming
did
and
since
he
held
per
cent
of
the
common
stock
himself
try
and
do
anything
about
it
anything
short
of
retiring
fleming
to
the
graveyard
that
is
rand
amended
that
would
do
for
a
very
nicely
what
were
fleming
objections
to
the
merger
mainly
sentimental
premix
was
his
baby
or
at
least
his
kid
brother
his
father
started
mixing
pancake
flour
back
before
the
first
world
war
and
lane
fleming
peddled
it
off
a
spring
wagon
they
worked
up
a
nice
little
local
trade
and
finally
a
wholesale
business
they
incorporated
in
the
early
twenties
and
then
after
the
old
man
died
lane
fleming
hired
an
advertising
agency
to
promote
his
products
and
built
up
a
national
distribution
and
took
on
some
sidelines
then
during
the
late
chamberlain
in
our
time
he
picked
up
a
refugee
czech
chemist
and
named
anton
varcek
who
whipped
up
a
lot
of
new
products
so
business
got
better
and
better
and
they
made
more
money
to
spend
on
advertising
to
get
more
money
to
buy
more
advertising
to
make
more
money
like
bill
nye
puritans
digging
clams
in
the
winter
to
get
strength
to
hoe
corn
in
the
summer
to
get
strength
to
dig
clams
in
the
winter
so
premix
became
a
sort
of
symbol
of
achievement
to
fleming
then
he
was
one
of
these
paternalistic
employers
and
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
relinquished
control
a
lot
of
his
old
retainers
would
be
turned
out
to
grass
and
finally
he
was
opposed
in
principle
to
concentration
of
business
ownership
he
claimed
it
made
business
more
vulnerable
to
government
control
and
eventual
socialization
i
not
sure
he
did
have
something
there
rand
considered
we
get
all
our
corporate
eggs
in
a
few
baskets
and
they
that
much
easier
for
the
boys
to
grab
just
who
on
the
premix
side
was
in
favor
of
this
merger
just
about
everybody
but
fleming
tipton
replied
his
two
fred
dunmore
and
varcek
who
are
first
and
second
vice
presidents
humphrey
goode
the
company
attorney
who
doubles
as
board
chairman
all
the
directors
all
the
new
york
banking
crowd
who
are
interested
in
premix
and
all
the
tinymites
i
do
know
who
inherits
fleming
voting
interest
but
i
can
find
out
for
you
by
this
time
tomorrow
do
that
tip
and
bill
me
for
what
you
think
finding
out
is
worth
rand
said
it
be
a
novel
reversal
of
order
for
you
to
be
billing
me
for
an
investigation
now
how
about
the
family
as
distinct
from
the
company
well
there
your
client
gladys
fleming
she
married
lane
fleming
about
ten
years
ago
when
she
was
and
he
was
in
spite
of
the
age
difference
i
understand
it
was
a
fairly
happy
marriage
then
there
are
two
daughters
by
a
previous
marriage
nelda
dunmore
and
geraldine
varcek
and
their
respective
husbands
they
all
live
together
in
a
big
house
at
rosemont
in
the
company
dunmore
is
sales
and
varcek
is
production
they
each
have
a
corner
of
the
mantle
of
lane
fleming
in
one
hand
and
a
dirk
in
the
other
nelda
and
geraldine
hate
each
other
like
greeks
and
trojans
nelda
is

you

suicide

such

been
spreading
them
oh
they
are
the

about

told
him
emanating
i

from
sources
interested
in
shaking
out

before

the
story
is
always
approximately
the

that
lane
fleming
saw
his
company
drifting
reefward
was
unwilling
to
survive
the
shipwreck
and
performed
the
family
are
supposed
to
have
faked
up

afterward
i
dismiss
the
whole
thing
as
a
rather
less
than
subtle
bit
of
chicanery
or
a
smoke
screen
to
cover
the
defects
in
camouflaging
a
murder
as
an
accident
rand
added
tipton
nodded
that
could
be
so
too
he
agreed
say
somebody
dislikes
the
looks
of
that
accident
and
starts
investigating
then
he
runs
into
all
this
miasma
of
suicide
rumors
and
promptly
shrugs
the
whole
thing
off
fleming
killed
himself
and
the
family
made
a
few
alterations
and
are
passing
it
off
as
an
accident
the
families
of
suicides
have
been
known
to
do
that
yes
regular
system
if
the
accident
line
is
penetrated
the
suicide
line
is
back
of
it
rand
said
well
in
the
last
few
years
we
seen
defenses
in
depth
penetrated
with
monotonous
regularity
i
jeeped
through
a
couple
myself
to
interrogate
the
surviving

all
in
having
the
guns
and
armor
to
smash
through
with
chapter
humphrey
goode
was
short
and
chunky
with
a
fringe
of
white
hair
around
a
bald
crown
his
brow
was
corrugated
with
wrinkles
and
he
peered
suspiciously
at
rand
through
a
pair
of
glasses
his
wide
mouth
curved
downward
at
the
corners
in
an
expression
that
was
probably
intended
to
be
stern
and
succeeded
only
in
being
pompous
his
office
was
dark
and
smelled
of
dusty
books
rand
he
began
accusingly
when
your
secretary
called
to
make
this
appointment
she
informed
me
that
you
had
been
retained
by
gladys
fleming
that
correct
rand
slowly
packed
tobacco
into
his
pipe
and
lit
it
fleming
wants
me
to
look
after
some
interests
of
hers
and
as
you
executor
of
her
late
husband
estate
i
thought
i
ought
to
talk
to
you
first
of
all
goode
eyes
narrowed
behind
the
thick
glasses
rand
if
you
investigating
the
death
of
lane
fleming
wasting
your
time
and
fleming
money
he
lectured
there
is
nothing
whatever
for
you
to
find
out
that
is
not
already
public
knowledge
fleming
was
accidentally
killed
by
the
discharge
of
an
old
revolver
he
was
cleaning
i
do
know
what
foolish
feminine
impulse
led
fleming
to
employ
you
but
you
do
nobody
any
good
in
this
matter
and
you
may
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
did
my
secretary
tell
you
i
was
making
an
investigation
rand
demanded
incredulously
she
does
usually
make
mistakes
of
that
sort
the
wrinkles
moved
up
goode
brow
like
a
battalion
advancing
in
platoon
front
he
looked
even
more
narrowly
at
rand
his
suspicion
compounded
with
bewilderment
why
should
i
investigate
the
death
of
lane
fleming
rand
continued
as
far
as
i
know
fleming
is
satisfied
that
it
was
an
accident
she
never
expressed
any
other
belief
to
me
do
you
think
it
was
anything
else
why
of
course
not
goode
exclaimed
that
just
what
i
was
telling
you
i
he
took
a
fresh
start
there
have
been
rumors
utterly
without
foundation
of
course
that
fleming
committed
suicide
they
are
i
may
say
nothing
but
malicious
fabrications
circulated
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
public
confidence
in
premix
foods
incorporated
i
had
thought
that
perhaps
fleming
might
have
heard
them
and
decided
on
her
own
responsibility
to
bring
you
in
to
scotch
them
i
was
afraid
that
such
a
step
might
by
giving
these
rumors
fresh
currency
defeat
its
intended
purpose
oh
nothing
of
the
sort
rand
told
him
i
not
in
the
least
interested
in
how
fleming
was
killed
and
the
question
is
simply
not
involved
in
what
fleming
wants
me
to
do
he
stopped
there
goode
was
looking
at
him
sideways
sucking
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
pushing
out
the
other
it
was
not
a
facial
contortion
that
impressed
rand
favorably
it
was
too
reminiscent
of
a
principal
under
whom
he
had
suffered
years
ago
in
vicksburg
mississippi
rand
began
to
suspect
that
goode
might
be
just
another
such
opinionated
egotistical
windbag
such
men
could
be
dangerous
were
usually
quite
unscrupulous
and
were
almost
always
unpleasant
to
deal
with
then
why
the
lawyer
demanded
did
fleming
employ
you
well
as
you
know
rand
began
the
fleming
now
the
joint
property
of
fleming
and
her
two
stepdaughters
is
an
extremely
valuable
asset
fleming
spent
the
better
part
of
his
life
gathering
it
at
one
time
or
another
he
must
have
owned
between
four
and
five
thousand
different
pistols
and
revolvers
the
hundred
left
to
his
heirs
represent
the
result
of
a
systematic
policy
of
discriminating
purchase
replacement
of
inferior
items
and
general
improvement
one
of
the
largest
and
most
famous
collections
of
its
kind
in
the
country
well
goode
was
completely
out
of
his
depth
by
now
surely
fleming
does
think
fleming
thinks
that
expert
advice
is
urgently
needed
in
disposing
of
that
collection
rand
replied
carefully
picking
his
words
to
fit
what
he
estimated
to
be
goode
probable
semantic
reactions
she
has
the
utmost
confidence
in
your
ability
and
integrity
as
an
attorney
however
she
realized
that
you
could
hardly
describe
yourself
as
an
expert
it
happens
that
i
am
an
expert
in
antique
firearms
particularly
pistols
i
have
a
collection
of
my
own
i
am
the
author
of
a
number
of
articles
on
the
subject
and
i
am
recognized
as
something
of
an
authority
i
know
and
understand
market
conditions
furthermore
not
being
a
dealer
or
connected
with
any
museum
i
have
no
mercenary
motive
for
undervaluing
the
collection
that
all
there
is
to
it
fleming
has
retained
me
as
a
in
connection
with
the
collection
goode
was
looking
at
rand
as
though
the
latter
had
just
torn
off
a
mask
revealing
another
and
entirely
different
set
of
features
underneath
the
change
seemed
to
be
a
welcome
one
but
he
was
evidently
having
trouble
adjusting
to
it
rand
grinned
inwardly
now
he
was
going
to
have
to
find
himself
a
new
set
of
verbal
labels
and
identifications
well
rand
that
alters
the
situation
considerably
he
said
with
noticeably
less
hostility
he
was
still
a
bit
resentful
people
had
no
right
to
confuse
him
by
jumping
about
from
one
category
to
another
like
that
now
understand
i
not
trying
to
be
offensive
but
it
seems
a
little
unusual
for
a
private
detective
also
to
be
an
authority
on
antique
firearms
fleming
was
an
authority
on
antique
firearms
and
he
was
a
manufacturer
of
foodstuffs
rand
parried
carefully
staying
inside
goode
aristotelian
system
of
categories
and
verbal
identifications
my
own
business
does
not
occupy
all
my
time
any
more
than
his
did
and
i
doubt
if
an
interest
in
the
history
and
development
of
deadly
weapons
is
any
more
incongruous
in
a
criminologist
than
in
an
industrialist
but
if
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
as
to
my
qualifications
you
can
check
with
colonel
taylor
at
the
state
museum
or
with
the
editor
of
the
i
see
goode
nodded
and
as
you
point
out
being
a
sort
of
expert
you
should
be
free
from
mercenary
bias
he
nodded
again
taking
off
his
glasses
and
polishing
them
on
an
outsize
white
handkerchief
frankly
now
that
i
understand
your
purpose
rand
i
must
say
that
i
am
quite
glad
that
fleming
took
this
step
i
was
perplexed
about
how
to
deal
with
that
collection
i
realized
that
it
was
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
but
i
have
the
vaguest
idea
how
much
or
how
it
could
be
sold
to
the
best
advantage
at
a
rough
guess
rand
how
much
do
you
think
it
ought
to
bring
rand
shook
his
head
i
only
saw
it
twice
the
last
time
two
years
ago
ask
me
that
after
i
spent
a
day
or
so
going
over
it
and
i
be
able
to
give
you
an
estimate
i
will
say
this
though
it
probably
worth
a
lot
more
than
the
ten
thousand
dollars
arnold
rivers
has
offered
for
it
that
produced
an
unexpected
effect
goode
straightened
in
his
chair
gobbling
in
surprised
indignation
arnold
rivers
has
he
had
the
impudence
to
try
to
buy
the
collection
he
demanded
where
did
you
hear
that
from
fleming
i
understand
he
made
the
offer
to
fred
dunmore
that
his
business
is
it
i
believe
the
colloquial
term
is
goode
said
why
that
man
is
a
notorious
swindler
rand
do
you
know
that
only
a
week
before
his
death
fleming
instructed
me
to
bring
suit
against
him
and
also
to
secure
his
indictment
on
criminal
charges
of
fraud
i
did
know
that
but
i
not
surprised
rand
answered
what
did
he
burn
fleming
with
here
i
show
you
goode
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
to
a
rank
of
steel
behind
the
desk
in
a
moment
he
was
back
with
a
large
manila
envelope
under
his
arm
and
a
huge
pistol
in
either
hand
here
rand
he
chuckled
we
just
test
your
firearms
knowledge
what
do
you
make
of
these
rand
took
the
pistols
and
looked
at
them
they
were
wheel
locks
apparently
south
german
they
were
a
good
two
feet
in
length
with
the
size
of
oranges
and
long
steel
the
stocks
were
so
covered
with
ivory
inlay
that
the
wood
showed
only
in
tiny
interstices
the
was
lavishly
engraved
and
to
the
were
attached
tags
marked
rand
examined
each
pistol
separately
then
compared
them
finally
he
took
a
rule
from
his
pocket
and
made
measurements
first
with
one
edge
and
then
with
the
other
well
i
damned
he
said
laying
them
on
the
desk
these
things
are
the
most
complete
fakes
i
ever
saw
locks
stocks
barrels
and
mountings
they
supposed
to
be
late
i
doubt
if
they
were
made
before
as
far
as
i
can
see
or
measure
there
is
the
slightest
difference
between
them
except
on
some
of
the
decorative
inlay
the
whole
job
must
have
been
miked
in
and
what
more
whoever
made
them
used
metric
measurements
you
find
pairs
of
english
dueling
pistols
as
early
as
that
are
almost
indistinguishable
but
in
when
these
things
were
supposed
to
have
been
made
a
gunsmith
was
working
fine
when
he
was
working
in
they
just
did
have
the
measuring
instruments
at
that
time
to
do
closer
work
i
wo
bother
taking
these
things
apart
but
if
i
did
i
bet
all
wall
street
to
junior
that
i
find
that
the
screws
were
and
the
interchanged
i
heard
about
fakes
like
these
he
named
a
famous
recently
liquidated
west
coast
collection
but
i
never
hoped
to
see
an
example
like
this
goode
gave
a
hacking
chuckle
you
do
as
an
rand
he
said
and
you
win
the
it
seems
that
after
fleming
bought
them
he
took
them
apart
and
found
just
as
you
say
that
the
had
been
and
that
the
were
interchangeable
from
one
pistol
to
the
other
there
were
a
lot
of
papers
accompanying
them
i
have
them
here
purporting
to
show
that
they
had
been
sold
by
some
austrian
nobleman
an
refugee
in
whose
family
they
had
been
since
the
reign
of
maximilian
ii
they
are
of
course
fabrications
i
looked
up
the
family
in
the
de
it
simply
never
existed
at
first
fleming
had
been
inclined
to
take
the
view
that
rivers
had
been
equally
victimized
with
himself
however
when
rivers
refused
to
take
back
the
pistols
and
refund
the
purchase
price
he
altered
his
opinion
he
placed
them
in
my
hands
instructing
me
to
bring
suit
and
also
start
criminal
action
he
was
in
a
fearful
rage
about
it
and
swore
that
he
drive
rivers
out
of
business
however
before
i
could
start
action
fleming
was
killed
in
that
accident
and
as
he
was
the
sole
witness
to
the
fact
of
the
sale
and
as
none
of
the
heirs
was
interested
i
did
nothing
about
it
in
fact
i
advised
them
that
action
against
rivers
would
cost
the
estate
more
than
they
could
hope
to
recover
in
damages
he
picked
up
one
of
the
pistols
and
examined
it
now
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
these
take
them
home
and
hang
them
over
the
mantel
rand
advised
if
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
selling
the
collection
i
do
want
anything
to
do
with
them
goode
was
peering
at
the
ivory
inlay
on
the
underbelly
of
the
stock
they
are
beautiful
and
i
do
care
when
they
were
made
he
said
i
think
if
nobody
else
wants
them
i
do
just
that
now
rand
what
had
you
intended
doing
about
the
collection
well
that
what
i
came
to
see
you
about
goode
as
i
understand
it
it
is
you
who
are
officially
responsible
for
selling
the
collection
and
the
proceeds
would
be
turned
over
to
you
for
distribution
to
fleming
dunmore
and
varcek
is
that
correct
yes
the
collection
although
in
the
physical
possession
of
fleming
is
still
an
undistributed
asset
i
thought
so
rand
got
out
gladys
fleming
letter
of
authorization
and
handed
it
to
goode
as
you
see
by
that
i
was
retained
by
and
only
by
fleming
he
said
i
am
assuming
that
her
interests
are
identical
with
those
of
the
other
heirs
but
i
realize
that
this
is
true
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
it
my
understanding
that
relations
between
the
three
ladies
are
not
the
most
pleasant
goode
produced
a
short
croaking
laugh
now
there
a
cautious
understatement
he
commented
rand
i
feel
that
you
should
know
that
all
three
hate
each
other
poisonously
that
was
rather
my
impression
now
i
expect
some
trouble
from
dunmore
varcek
either
or
both
of
whom
are
sure
to
accuse
me
of
having
been
brought
into
this
by
fleming
to
help
her
defraud
the
others
that
of
course
is
not
the
case
they
will
all
profit
equally
by
my
participation
in
this
but
i
going
to
have
trouble
convincing
them
of
that
yes
you
will
goode
agreed
would
you
rather
carry
my
authorization
than
mrs
fleming
yes
indeed
goode
to
tell
the
truth
that
was
why
i
came
here
for
one
reason
you
will
not
be
obligated
in
any
way
by
authorizing
me
to
act
as
your
agent
i
getting
my
fee
from
fleming
but
i
would
be
obligated
to
represent
her
only
as
far
as
her
interests
did
not
improperly
conflict
with
those
of
the
other
heirs
and
that
what
i
want
made
clear
goode
favored
the
detective
with
a
saurian
smile
you
not
a
lawyer
too
mr
rand
he
asked
well
i
am
a
member
of
the
bar
in
the
state
of
mississippi
though
i
never
practiced
rand
admitted
instead
of
opening
a
i
went
into
the
in
and
then
opened
a
private
agency
a
couple
of
years
later
but
if
i
had
to
which
god
forbid
i
could
go
home
tomorrow
and
hang
out
my
shingle
you
seem
to
have
had
quite
an
eventful
career
goode
remarked
with
a
queer
combination
of
envy
and
disapproval
i
understand
that
until
recently
you
were
an
officer
in
the
army
intelligence
too
i
have
your
authorization
to
act
for
me
made
out
immediately
to
list
and
appraise
the
collection
and
to
negotiate
with
prospective
purchasers
and
by
the
way
he
continued
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
had
heard
some
of
these
silly
rumors
to
the
effect
that
lane
fleming
had
committed
suicide
oh
that
what
always
heard
under
the
circumstances
rand
shrugged
a
certain
type
of
mind
rand
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
truth
in
any
of
these
scurrilous
stories
goode
declared
pumping
up
a
fine
show
of
indignation
the
premix
company
is
in
the
best
possible
financial
condition
a
glance
at
its
books
or
at
its
last
financial
statement
would
show
that
i
ought
to
know
i
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
just
because
there
was
some
talk
of
retrenchment
shortly
before
fleming
death
oh
no
responsible
person
pays
any
attention
to
that
sort
of
talk
rand
comforted
him
my
and
service
brings
me
into
contact
with
a
lot
of
the
local
financial
crowd
none
of
them
is
taking
these
rumors
seriously
well
of
course
nobody
wants
the
responsibility
of
starting
a
panic
even
a
minor
one
but
people
are
talking
and
it
hurting
premix
on
the
market
goode
gloomed
and
now
people
will
hear
of
having
retained
you
and
will
assume
just
as
i
did
at
first
that
you
are
making
some
kind
of
an
investigation
i
hope
you
will
make
a
prompt
denial
if
you
hear
any
talk
like
that
he
pressed
a
button
on
his
desk
and
now
i
get
a
letter
of
authorization
made
out
for
you
rand
chapter
stephen
gresham
was
in
his
early
sixties
but
he
could
have
still
worn
his
world
war
i
uniform
without
anything
giving
at
the
seams
and
buckled
the
old
sam
browne
at
the
same
hole
as
rand
entered
he
rose
from
behind
his
desk
and
advanced
smiling
cordially
why
hello
jeff
he
greeted
the
detective
grasping
his
hand
heartily
you
have
been
around
for
months
what
have
you
been
doing
and
why
do
you
come
out
to
rosemont
to
see
us
dot
and
irene
were
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
i
afraid
i
been
neglecting
too
many
of
my
old
friends
lately
rand
admitted
sitting
down
and
getting
his
pipe
out
been
busy
as
the
devil
fact
is
it
was
business
that
finally
brought
me
around
here
i
understand
that
you
and
some
others
are
forming
a
pool
to
buy
the
lane
fleming
collection
yes
gresham
became
enthusiastic
want
in
on
it
i
sure
the
others
would
be
glad
to
have
you
in
with
us
we
going
to
need
all
the
money
we
can
scrape
together
with
this
damned
rivers
bidding
against
us
i
afraid
you
will
at
that
stephen
rand
told
him
and
not
necessarily
on
account
of
rivers
you
see
the
fleming
estate
has
just
employed
me
to
expertize
the
collection
and
handle
the
sale
for
them
rand
got
his
pipe
lit
and
drawing
properly
i
hate
doing
this
to
you
but
you
know
how
it
is
oh
of
course
i
should
have
known
they
get
somebody
like
you
in
to
sell
the
collection
for
them
humphrey
goode
is
competent
to
handle
that
what
we
were
all
afraid
of
was
a
public
auction
at
some
rand
shook
his
head
worst
thing
they
could
do
a
collection
like
that
would
go
for
peanuts
at
auction
remember
the
big
sales
in
the
twenties
why
here
i
going
to
be
in
rosemont
staying
at
the
fleming
place
working
on
the
collection
for
the
next
week
or
so
i
suppose
your
crowd
would
want
to
make
an
offer
until
i
have
everything
listed
but
i
like
to
talk
to
your
associates
in
a
group
as
soon
as
possible
well
we
all
know
pretty
much
what
in
the
collection
gresham
said
we
were
neighbors
of
his
and
collectors
are
a
gregarious
lot
but
we
are
anxious
to
make
any
premature
offers
we
do
want
to
offer
more
than
we
have
to
and
at
the
same
time
we
do
want
to
underbid
and
see
the
collection
sold
elsewhere
no
of
course
not
rand
thought
for
a
moment
tell
you
what
i
give
you
and
your
friends
the
best
break
i
can
in
fairness
to
my
clients
not
obliged
to
call
for
sealed
bids
or
anything
like
that
so
when
heard
from
everybody
i
give
you
a
chance
to
bid
against
the
highest
offer
in
hand
if
you
want
to
top
it
you
can
have
the
collection
for
any
kind
of
an
overbid
that
does
look
too
suspiciously
nominal
why
jeff
i
appreciate
that
gresham
said
i
think
you
entirely
within
your
rights
but
naturally
we
wo
mention
this
outside
i
can
imagine
arnold
rivers
for
instance
taking
a
very
righteous
view
of
such
an
arrangement
yes
so
can
i
of
course
if
he
call
me
a
crook
i
take
that
as
a
compliment
rand
said
i
wonder
if
i
could
meet
your
group
say
tomorrow
evening
i
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
assure
the
fleming
family
and
humphrey
goode
that
you
all
serious
and
responsible
well
we
very
serious
about
it
gresham
replied
and
i
think
all
responsible
you
can
look
us
up
if
you
wish
besides
myself
there
is
philip
cabot
of
cabot
joyner
teale
whom
you
know
and
adam
trehearne
who
worth
about
a
in
industrial
shares
and
colin
macbride
who
vice
president
in
charge
of
construction
and
maintenance
for
power
light
at
about
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
pierre
jarrett
and
his
fiancée
karen
lawrence
pierre
was
a
marine
captain
invalided
home
after
being
wounded
on
peleliu
he
writes
for
the
pulps
karen
has
a
little
business
in
rosemont
they
intend
using
their
share
of
the
collection
plus
such
culls
and
duplicates
as
the
rest
of
us
can
consign
to
them
to
go
into
the
arms
business
with
a
sideline
which
karen
can
manage
while
pierre
writing
tell
you
what
i
call
a
meeting
at
my
place
tomorrow
evening
say
at
eight
thirty
that
suit
you
that
rand
agreed
would
be
all
right
gresham
asked
him
how
recently
he
had
seen
the
fleming
collection
about
two
years
ago
right
after
i
got
back
from
germany
you
remember
we
went
there
together
one
evening
in
march
yes
that
right
we
did
have
time
to
see
everything
gresham
said
my
god
jeff
wheel
locks
ten
snaphaunces
and
every
imaginable
kind
of
flintlock
over
a
hundred
martials
including
the
springfield
all
the
north
types
a
couple
of
virginia
manufactory
models
and
he
got
this
since
the
last
time
you
saw
the
collection
a
real
rappahannock
forge
flintlock
and
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
colts
all
models
and
most
variants
remember
that
big
whitneyville
walker
in
original
condition
he
got
that
one
in
at
the
fred
hines
sale
at
the
old
walpole
galleries
and
seven
paterson
colts
including
a
couple
of
cased
sets
and
anything
else
you
can
think
of
a
hall
flintlock
an
elisha
collier
flintlock
revolver
a
pair
of
forsythe
pistols
oh
that
a
collection
to
end
collections
by
the
way
humphrey
goode
showed
me
a
pair
of
big
wheel
locks
all
covered
with
ivory
inlay
rand
mentioned
gresham
laughed
heartily
are
they
the
damnedest
ever
seen
though
he
asked
made
in
germany
about
or
about
the
time
was
just
getting
out
of
the
stage
would
you
say
i
say
made
in
japan
about
rand
replied
remember
there
were
a
couple
of
small
human
figures
on
each
pistol
a
knight
and
a
huntsman
did
you
notice
that
they
had
slant
eyes
he
stopped
laughing
and
looked
at
gresham
seriously
just
how
much
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
think
i
going
to
have
to
weed
out
of
the
collection
before
i
can
offer
it
for
sale
he
asked
gresham
shook
his
head
they
all
they
were
lane
fleming
one
false
step
ordinarily
lane
was
a
careful
buyer
he
must
have
let
himself
get
hypnotized
by
all
that
ivory
and
gold
and
all
that
documentation
on
crested
notepaper
you
know
fleming
death
was
an
undeserved
stroke
of
luck
for
arnold
rivers
if
he
had
been
killed
just
when
he
was
have
run
rivers
out
of
the
business
i
notice
that
rivers
is
advertising
in
the
any
more
rand
observed
no
the
national
rifle
association
stopped
his
ad
and
lifted
his
membership
card
for
good
measure
gresham
said
rivers
sold
a
rifle
to
a
collector
down
in
virginia
about
three
years
ago
while
you
were
still
occupying
germany
a
fine
early
flintlock
kentuck
that
had
been
made
out
of
a
fine
late
percussion
kentuck
by
sawing
off
the
of
the
barrel
rethreading
it
for
the
drilling
a
new
vent
and
fitting
the
lock
with
a
flint
hammer
and
a
assembly
and
shortening
the
to
fit
rivers
has
a
gunsmith
over
at
kingsville
one
elmer
umholtz
who
does
all
his
fraudulent
conversions
for
him
i
have
an
example
of
umholtz
craftsmanship
myself
the
collector
who
bought
this
spurious
flintlock
spotted
what
had
been
done
and
squawked
to
the
rifle
association
and
to
the
postal
authorities
rivers
claimed
i
suppose
that
he
had
gotten
it
from
a
family
that
had
owned
it
ever
since
it
was
made
and
showed
letters
signed
boone
and
crockett
to
prove
it
no
he
claimed
to
have
gotten
it
in
trade
from
some
wayfaring
collector
gresham
replied
he
convinced
uncle
whiskers
but
the
took
a
slightly
dimmer
view
of
the
transaction
so
rivers
advertise
in
the
any
more
was
there
some
talk
about
whitneyville
walker
colts
that
had
been
made
out
of
model
colt
dragoons
rand
asked
oh
lord
yes
this
fellow
umholtz
was
practically
turning
them
out
on
an
for
a
while
rivers
must
have
sold
about
ten
of
them
you
know
umholtz
is
a
really
fine
gunsmith
i
had
him
build
a
for
dot
a
couple
of
years
ago
action
johnson
barrel
chambered
for
savage
umholtz
made
the
stock
and
fitted
a
it
a
beautiful
little
rifle
i
hate
to
see
him
prostitute
his
talents
the
way
he
does
by
making
these
fake
antiques
for
rivers
you
know
he
made
one
of
these
mythical
heavy
of
the
sort
colt
was
supposed
to
have
turned
out
at
paterson
in
for
colonel
walker
texas
rangers
you
know
the
model
he
could
find
any
of
in
when
he
made
the
real
walker
colt
that
story
you
find
in
book
why
that
story
been
absolutely
disproved
rand
said
there
never
was
any
such
revolver
not
till
umholtz
made
one
gresham
replied
rivers
sold
it
to
he
named
a
bigshot
for
hundred
dollars
his
story
was
that
he
picked
it
up
in
mexico
in
traded
a
to
some
halfbreed
for
it
this
fellow
who
bought
it
now
did
he
see
belden
and
haven
colt
book
when
it
came
out
in
yes
and
he
was
plenty
burned
up
but
what
could
he
do
rivers
was
dug
in
behind
this
maginot
line
of
his
you
know
that
bastard
took
me
once
just
as
badly
with
a
fake
north
cheney
navy
flintlock
model
that
had
been
made
out
of
a
french
model
the
lawyer
muttered
obscenely
why
did
you
sue
hell
out
of
him
rand
asked
you
might
not
have
gotten
anything
but
you
have
given
him
a
lot
of
dirty
publicity
that
all
fleming
was
expecting
to
do
about
those
wheel
locks
i
not
fleming
he
could
afford
litigation
like
that
i
ca
i
want
my
money
and
if
i
do
get
it
in
cash
i
going
to
beat
it
out
of
that
dirty
little
swindler
hide
gresham
replied
an
ugly
look
appearing
on
his
face
i
would
blame
you
you
could
find
plenty
of
other
collectors
hold
your
coat
while
you
were
doing
it
rand
told
him
then
he
inquired
idly
what
sort
of
a
pistol
was
it
that
lane
fleming
is
supposed
to
have
shot
himself
with
gresham
frowned
i
really
do
know
i
did
see
it
it
supposed
to
have
been
a
confederate
leech
rigdon
you
know
one
of
those
imitation
colt
navy
models
that
were
made
in
the
south
during
the
civil
war
rand
nodded
he
was
familiar
with
the
type
the
story
is
that
fleming
found
it
hanging
back
of
the
counter
at
some
roadside
along
with
a
lot
of
other
old
pistols
and
talked
the
proprietor
into
letting
it
go
for
a
few
dollars
gresham
continued
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
loaded
at
the
time
and
went
off
while
fleming
was
working
on
it
at
home
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
believe
that
jeff
lane
fleming
would
know
a
loaded
revolver
when
he
saw
one
i
believe
he
deliberately
shot
himself
and
the
family
faked
the
accident
and
fixed
the
authorities
the
police
never
made
any
investigation
it
was
handled
by
the
coroner
alone
and
our
coroner
out
in
scott
county
is
eminently
fixable
if
you
go
about
it
right
a
pitiful
little
nonentity
with
a
tremendous
inferiority
complex
but
good
lord
why
rand
demanded
i
never
heard
of
fleming
having
any
troubles
worth
killing
himself
over
gresham
lowered
his
voice
jeff
i
not
supposed
to
talk
about
this
but
the
fact
is
that
i
believe
fleming
was
about
to
lose
control
of
the
premix
company
he
said
i
have
well
sources
of
inside
information
this
is
in
confidence
so
do
quote
me
but
certain
influences
were
at
work
inside
the
company
toward
that
end
he
inspected
the
tip
of
his
cigar
and
knocked
off
the
ash
into
the
tray
at
his
elbow
lane
death
is
on
record
as
accidental
jeff
it
been
written
off
as
such
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
all
concerned
if
it
were
left
at
that
chapter
rand
drove
slowly
through
rosemont
the
next
day
refreshing
his
memory
of
the
place
it
was
one
of
the
many
commuters
villages
strung
out
for
fifty
miles
along
the
railroad
lines
radiating
from
new
belfast
and
depended
for
its
support
upon
a
population
scattered
over
a
radius
at
estates
and
country
homes
obviously
a
planned
community
it
was
dominated
by
a
railroad
station
which
stood
on
its
like
a
captain
in
front
of
four
platoons
of
houses
and
stores
aligned
along
as
many
converging
roads
there
was
a
post
office
uniform
with
the
rest
of
the
buildings
an
excessive
quantity
of
aluminum
trimming
dated
it
somewhere
in
the
middle
andrew
mellon
period
there
were
four
gas
stations
a
movie
theater
and
a
woolworth
store
with
a
red
front
that
made
it
look
like
some
painted
hussy
who
had
wandered
into
a
quaker
meeting
over
the
door
of
one
of
the
smaller
stores
rand
saw
a
white
sign
there
was
a
plymouth
coupé
parked
in
front
of
it
instead
of
turning
onto
the
road
to
the
fleming
estate
he
continued
along
route
for
a
mile
or
so
beyond
the
village
until
he
came
to
a
red
brick
house
on
the
right
he
pulled
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
got
out
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
trench
coat
the
air
was
raw
and
damp
doubly
unpleasant
after
the
recent
unseasonable
warmth
an
apathetically
persistent
rain
sogged
the
old
fields
on
either
side
and
the
beyond
and
a
high
ceiling
of
unbroken
dirty
gray
gave
no
promise
of
clearing
the
mournful
hoot
of
a
distant
locomotive
whistle
was
the
only
sound
to
pierce
the
silence
for
a
moment
rand
stood
with
his
back
to
the
car
looking
at
the
sign
that
proclaimed
this
to
be
the
of
arnold
rivers
fine
antique
and
modern
firearms
for
the
discriminating
collector
the
house
faced
the
road
with
a
long
side
at
the
left
a
porch
formed
a
continuation
under
a
deck
roof
and
on
the
right
an
ell
had
been
built
at
right
angles
extending
thirty
feet
toward
the
road
although
connected
to
the
house
by
a
shed
roof
which
acquired
a
double
pitch
and
became
a
gable
roof
where
the
ell
projected
forward
it
was
in
effect
a
separate
building
with
its
own
front
door
and
its
own
its
was
about
four
feet
lower
than
that
of
the
parent
structure
a
fibber
mcgee
clanged
as
rand
entered
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
looked
around
the
room
some
twenty
feet
wide
and
fifty
long
was
lighted
by
an
almost
continuous
row
of
casement
windows
on
the
right
and
another
on
the
left
for
as
far
as
the
ell
extended
beyond
the
house
they
were
set
high
a
good
five
feet
from
lower
sill
to
floor
and
there
was
no
ceiling
the
sloping
roof
was
supported
by
bare
timber
rafters
racks
lined
the
walls
under
the
windows
holding
and
swords
the
pistols
and
daggers
and
other
small
items
were
displayed
on
a
number
of
long
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
glaring
at
the
front
door
was
a
brass
on
a
ship
carriage
a
philippine
muzzle
tilted
upward
stood
beside
it
where
the
ell
joined
the
house
under
the
shed
roof
there
was
a
fireplace
and
a
short
flight
of
steps
to
a
landing
and
a
door
out
of
the
dwelling
and
some
furniture
a
davenport
three
or
four
deep
chairs
facing
the
fire
a
low
a
cellarette
and
in
the
far
corner
a
big
desk
as
rand
went
toward
the
rear
a
young
man
rose
from
one
of
the
chairs
laid
aside
a
magazine
and
advanced
to
meet
him
he
did
exactly
harmonize
with
all
the
lethal
array
around
him
he
would
have
looked
more
at
home
presiding
over
an
establishment
devoted
to
ladies
items
his
costume
ran
to
pastel
shades
he
had
large
and
soulful
blue
eyes
and
prettily
dimpled
cheeks
and
his
longish
blond
hair
was
carefully
disordered
into
a
windblown
effect
oh
good
afternoon
he
greeted
is
there
anything
in
particular
interested
in
or
would
you
like
to
just
look
about
mostly
look
about
rand
said
is
rivers
in
rivers
is
having
luncheon
he
be
finished
before
long
if
you
care
to
wait
have
you
ever
been
here
before
not
for
some
time
rand
said
when
i
was
here
last
there
was
a
young
fellow
named
jordan
or
gordon
or
something
like
that
oh
he
was
before
my
time
the
present
functionary
introduced
himself
as
cecil
gillis
rand
gave
his
name
and
shook
hands
with
him
young
gillis
wanted
to
know
if
rand
was
a
collector
in
a
small
way
collector
rand
told
him
have
you
many
colts
now
there
was
a
whole
table
devoted
to
colts
no
spurious
whitneyville
walkers
after
all
a
dealer
can
sell
just
so
many
of
such
rarities
before
the
finger
of
suspicion
begins
leveling
itself
in
his
direction
and
arnold
rivers
had
long
ago
passed
that
point
there
were
several
of
the
commoner
percussion
models
however
with
lovely
perfect
bluing
that
was
considerably
darker
than
that
applied
at
the
colt
factory
during
the
and
of
the
last
century
the
silver
plating
on
backstraps
and
was
perfect
too
but
the
and
engravings
on
the
cylinders
were
far
from
clear
in
one
case
completely
obliterated
the
cylinder
of
one
navy
bore
serial
numbers
that
looked
as
though
they
had
been
altered
to
conform
to
the
numbers
on
other
parts
of
the
weapon
many
of
the
colts
however
were
entirely
correct
and
all
were
in
reasonably
good
condition
rand
saw
something
that
interested
him
and
picked
it
up
that
is
a
real
colt
the
exquisite
gillis
told
him
it
a
confederate
copy
a
leech
rigdon
so
i
see
i
have
a
griswold
grier
but
no
leech
rigdon
the
griswold
grier
that
the
one
with
the
brass
frame
cecil
gillis
said
surprising
how
many
collectors
think
all
confederate
revolvers
had
brass
frames
because
of
the
griswold
grier
and
the
spiller
burr
that
an
unusually
fine
specimen
rand
rivers
got
it
sometime
in
late
december
or
early
january
from
a
gentleman
in
charleston
i
understand
i
believe
it
had
been
carried
during
the
civil
war
by
a
member
of
the
former
owner
family
rand
looked
at
the
tag
tied
to
the
it
was
marked
in
with
three
different
prices
that
was
characteristic
of
arnold
rivers
business
methods
how
much
does
rivers
want
for
this
he
asked
handing
the
revolver
to
young
gillis
the
clerk
mentally
decoded
the
three
prices
and
vacillated
for
a
moment
over
them
he
had
already
appraised
rand
from
his
stetson
past
his
burberry
trench
coat
to
his
english
shoes
and
placed
him
in
the
bracket
however
from
some
remarks
rand
had
let
drop
he
decided
that
this
customer
knew
pistols
and
probably
knew
values
why
that
is
sixty
dollars
rand
he
said
with
the
air
of
one
conferring
a
benefaction
maybe
he
was
at
that
rand
decided
prices
had
jumped
like
the
very
devil
since
the
war
i
take
it
he
dug
out
his
billfold
and
extracted
three
twenties
nice
clean
condition
clean
it
up
yourself
why
no
rivers
got
it
like
this
as
i
said
it
supposed
to
have
been
a
family
heirloom
but
from
the
way
it
been
cared
for
i
would
have
thought
it
had
been
in
a
collection
the
clerk
replied
shall
i
wrap
it
for
you
yes
if
you
please
rand
followed
him
to
the
rear
laying
aside
his
coat
and
hat
gillis
got
some
heavy
paper
out
of
a
closet
and
packaged
it
then
hunted
through
a
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
desk
until
he
found
the
card
he
wanted
he
made
a
few
notes
on
it
and
was
still
holding
it
and
the
sixty
dollars
when
he
rejoined
rand
by
the
fire
in
spite
of
his
effeminate
appearance
and
manner
the
young
fellow
really
knew
arms
the
conversation
passed
from
confederate
revolvers
to
the
arms
of
the
civil
war
in
general
and
they
were
discussing
the
changes
in
tactics
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
the
revolver
and
the
repeating
carbine
when
the
door
from
the
house
opened
and
arnold
rivers
appeared
on
the
landing
he
looked
older
than
when
rand
had
last
seen
him
his
hair
was
thinner
on
top
and
grayer
at
the
temples
never
particularly
robust
he
had
lost
weight
and
his
face
was
thinner
and
more
his
mouth
still
had
the
old
curve
of
supercilious
insolence
and
he
was
still
smoking
with
the
carved
ivory
which
rand
remembered
he
looked
his
visitor
over
carefully
from
the
doorway
decided
that
he
was
not
soliciting
magazine
subscriptions
or
selling
fuller
brushes
and
came
down
the
steps
as
he
did
he
must
have
recognized
rand
he
shifted
the
to
his
left
hand
and
extended
his
right
rand
is
it
he
asked
i
thought
i
knew
you
it
been
some
years
since
you
been
around
here
i
been
a
lot
of
places
in
the
meantime
rand
said
you
were
here
last
in
october
were
you
rivers
thought
for
a
moment
you
bought
a
highlander
then
by
alexander
murdoch
of
doune
was
it
no
andrew
strahan
of
edzel
rand
replied
rivers
snapped
his
fingers
that
right
i
sold
both
of
those
pistols
at
about
the
same
time
a
gentleman
in
chicago
got
the
murdoch
the
strahan
had
a
lobe
on
the
hammer
did
you
ever
get
anybody
to
translate
the
gaelic
inscription
on
the
barrel
you
a
memory
like
jim
farley
rand
flattered
the
inscription
was
the
clan
slogan
of
the
camerons
something
like
of
the
hound
come
and
get
flesh
i
wo
attempt
the
original
rand
just
bought
the
leech
rigdon
gillis
interjected
handing
rivers
the
card
and
the
money
rivers
looked
at
both
saw
how
much
rand
had
been
taken
for
and
nodded
a
nice
item
he
faintly
praised
as
though
anything
selling
for
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
was
so
much
garbage
considering
the
condition
in
which
confederate
arms
are
usually
found
it
really
i
think
you
like
it
mr
rand
the
telephone
rang
cecil
gillis
answered
it
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
said
for
you
rivers
long
distance
from
milwaukee
rivers
face
lit
with
the
beatific
smile
of
a
cat
at
a
promising
ah
excuse
me
mr
rand
he
crossed
to
the
desk
picked
up
the
phone
and
spoke
into
it
this
is
arnold
rivers
he
said
much
as
edward
murrow
used
to
say
is
london
the
telephone
sputtered
for
a
moment
ah
yes
indeed
verral
quite
well
i
thank
you
and
you
no
it
has
been
sold
yet
do
you
wish
me
to
ship
it
to
you
on
approval
certainly
of
course
it
an
original
flintlock
i
did
list
it
as
did
i
no
not
at
all
the
only
replacement
is
the
small
spring
inside
the
patchbox
yes
the
rifling
is
excellent
of
course
i
ship
it
at
once
mr
verral
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
his
hireling
fairly
licking
his
chops
cecil
verral
in
milwaukee
whose
address
we
have
has
just
ordered
the
zorger
flintlock
kentuck
will
you
please
attend
to
it
right
away
mr
rivers
gillis
went
to
one
of
the
racks
under
the
windows
and
selected
a
long
flintlock
rifle
carrying
it
out
the
door
at
the
rear
i
issued
a
list
a
few
days
ago
rivers
told
rand
when
cecil
comes
back
i
have
him
get
you
a
copy
i
been
receiving
calls
ever
since
this
is
the
twelfth
call
since
tuesday
business
must
be
good
rand
commented
i
understand
you
offered
to
buy
the
lane
fleming
collection
for
ten
thousand
dollars
where
did
you
hear
that
rivers
demanded
looking
up
from
the
drawer
in
which
he
was
filing
the
card
on
the
leech
rigdon
from
mrs
fleming
rand
released
a
puff
of
pipe
smoke
and
watched
it
draw
downward
into
the
fireplace
i
been
retained
to
handle
the
sale
of
that
collection
naturally
i
know
who
was
offering
how
much
rivers
eyes
narrowed
he
came
around
the
desk
loading
another
cigarette
into
his
holder
and
just
why
might
i
ask
did
fleming
think
it
in
order
to
employ
a
detective
in
a
matter
like
that
he
wanted
to
know
rand
let
out
more
smoke
she
did
she
employed
an
a
colonel
jefferson
davis
rand
who
is
a
contributor
to
the
and
the
and
and
the
old
you
read
some
of
his
articles
i
believe
then
you
not
making
an
investigation
what
in
the
world
is
there
to
investigate
rand
asked
i
just
selling
a
lot
of
old
pistols
for
the
fleming
estate
i
thought
fred
dunmore
was
doing
that
so
did
fred
you
both
wrong
though
i
am
he
got
out
goode
letter
of
authorization
and
handed
it
to
rivers
who
read
it
through
twice
before
handing
it
back
you
see
anything
in
that
about
fred
dunmore
or
any
of
the
other
he
asked
well
i
did
understand
i
glad
to
know
what
the
situation
really
is
rivers
frowned
i
thought
you
were
making
some
kind
of
an
investigation
and
as
i
the
only
party
making
any
serious
offer
to
buy
those
pistols
i
wanted
to
know
what
there
was
to
investigate
do
you
consider
ten
thousand
dollars
to
be
a
serious
offer
rand
asked
and
are
you
forgetting
stephen
gresham
and
his
friends
oh
those
people
rivers
scoffed
rand
you
certainly
do
expect
them
to
be
able
to
handle
anything
like
this
do
you
well
the
banks
speak
well
of
them
rand
replied
some
of
them
have
good
listings
in
dun
bradstreet
too
well
so
do
i
rivers
reported
i
can
top
any
offer
that
crowd
makes
what
do
you
expect
to
get
out
of
them
anyhow
i
have
talked
price
with
them
yet
a
lot
more
than
ten
thousand
dollars
anyhow
rivers
forced
a
laugh
now
rand
that
was
just
an
opening
offer
i
thought
fred
dunmore
was
handling
the
collection
he
grimaced
what
do
you
think
it
really
worth
rand
shrugged
it
probably
has
a
dealer
of
around
seventy
thousand
i
not
nuts
enough
to
expect
anything
like
that
in
a
lump
sum
but
please
let
not
mention
ten
thousand
dollars
in
this
connection
any
more
that
on
the
order
of
lawyer
marks
bidding
cents
for
uncle
tom
it
only
good
for
laughs
well
how
much
more
than
that
do
you
think
gresham
and
his
crowd
will
offer
i
have
talked
price
with
them
yet
rand
repeated
i
mean
to
as
soon
as
i
can
well
you
get
their
offer
and
i
top
it
rivers
declared
willing
to
go
as
high
as
thousand
for
that
collection
they
wo
go
that
high
although
he
just
managed
not
to
show
it
rand
was
really
surprised
even
a
consciousness
of
abstracting
had
not
prepared
him
for
the
shock
of
hearing
arnold
rivers
raise
his
own
offer
to
something
resembling
an
acceptable
figure
a
good
case
he
reflected
could
be
made
of
that
for
the
actuality
of
miracles
he
rose
picking
up
his
trench
coat
well
that
something
like
it
now
he
said
i
see
you
later
i
do
know
how
long
it
going
to
take
me
to
get
a
list
prepared
and
circularize
the
trade
i
should
hear
from
everybody
interested
in
a
few
weeks
you
can
be
sure
i
keep
your
offer
in
mind
he
slipped
into
the
coat
and
put
on
his
hat
and
then
picked
up
the
package
containing
the
confederate
revolver
rivers
had
risen
too
he
was
watching
rand
nervously
when
rand
tucked
the
package
under
his
arm
and
began
drawing
on
his
gloves
rivers
cleared
his
throat
rand
i
dreadfully
sorry
he
began
but
i
have
to
return
your
money
and
take
back
that
revolver
it
should
not
have
been
sold
he
got
rand
sixty
dollars
out
of
his
pocket
as
though
he
expected
it
to
catch
fire
and
held
it
out
rand
favored
him
with
a
display
of
pained
surprise
why
i
ca
do
that
he
replied
i
bought
this
revolver
in
good
faith
and
you
accepted
payment
and
were
satisfied
with
the
transaction
the
sale
been
made
now
rivers
seemed
distressed
it
was
probably
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
on
the
receiving
end
of
that
routine
and
he
did
like
it
now
you
being
unreasonable
rand
he
protested
look
here
give
you
dollars
credit
on
anything
else
in
the
shop
you
certainly
ca
find
fault
with
an
offer
like
that
i
do
want
anything
else
in
the
shop
i
want
this
revolver
you
sold
me
rand
gave
him
a
look
of
supercilious
insolence
that
was
at
least
a
two
hundred
per
cent
improvement
on
rivers
at
his
most
insolent
you
know
i
begin
to
acquire
a
poor
idea
of
your
business
methods
before
long
he
added
rivers
laughed
ruefully
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
just
remembered
a
customer
of
mine
who
specializes
in
confederate
arms
who
would
pay
me
at
least
eighty
for
that
item
he
admitted
i
thought
rand
shook
his
head
i
have
a
special
fondness
for
confederate
arms
myself
one
of
my
grandfathers
was
in
mosby
rangers
and
the
other
was
with
barksdale
to
say
nothing
of
about
a
dozen
and
so
on
well
you
entirely
within
your
rights
rand
rivers
conceded
i
should
apologize
for
trying
to
renege
on
a
sale
but
well
i
hope
to
see
you
again
soon
he
followed
rand
to
the
door
shaking
hands
with
him
do
forget
i
willing
to
pay
anything
up
to
thousand
for
the
fleming
collection
chapter
the
fleming
butler
walters
rand
remembered
gladys
fleming
having
called
him
became
apologetic
upon
learning
who
the
visitor
was
forgive
me
colonel
rand
but
i
afraid
i
must
put
you
to
some
inconvenience
sir
he
said
you
see
we
have
no
chauffeur
at
present
and
i
do
drive
very
well
myself
would
you
object
to
putting
up
your
own
car
sir
the
garage
is
under
the
house
at
the
rear
just
follow
the
driveway
around
i
go
through
the
house
and
meet
you
there
for
the
luggage
i
dreadfully
sorry
to
put
you
to
the
trouble
but
oh
that
all
right
rand
comforted
him
just
as
soon
do
it
myself
now
anyhow
i
expect
to
be
in
and
out
with
the
car
while
i
here
and
i
better
learn
the
layout
of
the
garage
now
you
may
back
in
sir
or
drive
straight
in
and
back
out
the
butler
told
him
one
way
about
as
easy
as
the
other
rand
returned
to
his
car
driving
around
the
house
a
row
of
doors
opened
out
of
the
basement
garage
walters
who
must
have
gone
through
the
house
on
the
double
was
waiting
for
him
having
what
amounted
to
a
conditioned
reflex
to
park
his
car
so
that
he
could
get
it
out
as
fast
as
possible
he
cut
over
to
the
right
jockeyed
a
little
and
backed
in
there
were
already
two
cars
in
the
garage
a
big
maroon
packard
sedan
and
a
packard
standing
side
by
side
rand
put
his
lincoln
in
on
the
left
of
the
sedan
bags
in
the
it
is
locked
he
told
the
butler
making
sure
that
the
where
he
had
placed
the
leech
rigdon
revolver
was
locked
as
he
got
out
the
servant
went
to
the
rear
of
the
car
and
took
out
the
gladstone
and
the
bag
rand
had
brought
with
him
if
you
do
mind
entering
the
house
from
the
rear
sir
we
can
go
up
those
steps
there
and
through
the
rear
hall
the
butler
suggested
almost
as
though
he
were
making
some
indecent
and
criminal
proposal
rand
told
him
to
forget
the
protocol
and
lead
the
way
the
butler
picked
up
the
bags
and
conducted
him
up
a
short
flight
of
concrete
steps
to
a
landing
and
a
door
opening
into
a
short
hall
above
an
open
door
from
this
gave
access
to
a
longer
hall
stretching
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
there
was
a
third
door
closed
which
probably
led
to
the
domain
rand
followed
his
guide
through
the
open
door
and
into
the
long
hall
which
passed
under
an
arch
to
extend
to
the
front
door
there
was
a
door
on
either
side
about
midway
to
the
arch
under
the
front
stairway
the
one
on
the
right
was
the
walters
explained
and
the
one
on
the
left
was
the
library
he
seemed
to
be
still
suffering
from
the
ignominy
of
admitting
a
through
any
but
the
main
portal
emerging
into
the
front
hallway
he
put
down
the
bags
took
rand
hat
and
coat
and
laid
them
on
top
of
the
luggage
and
then
went
to
an
open
doorway
on
the
right
standing
in
it
and
coughing
delicately
before
announcing
that
colonel
rand
was
here
gladys
fleming
wearing
a
pale
blue
frock
came
forward
as
rand
entered
the
parlor
her
hand
extended
the
two
other
women
in
the
big
parlor
remained
motionless
they
would
be
the
sisters
geraldine
varcek
and
nelda
dunmore
rand
did
wonder
that
they
resented
gladys
so
bitterly
economic
considerations
aside
girls
seldom
enthuse
over
a
stepmother
so
near
their
own
age
who
is
so
much
more
beautiful
good
afternoon
colonel
rand
gladys
said
this
is
mrs
varcek
she
indicated
a
very
pale
blonde
who
sat
slumped
in
a
deep
chair
beside
a
low
a
highball
in
her
hand
and
mrs
dunmore
she
was
the
brunette
with
the
full
bust
and
hips
in
the
short
black
skirt
and
the
tight
white
sweater
who
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
the
blonde
geraldine
smiled
shyly
at
him
she
had
big
blue
eyes
and
delicately
tinted
lips
that
seemed
to
be
trying
not
to
laugh
at
some
private
joke
she
was
exactly
blotto
but
she
had
evidently
laid
a
good
foundation
for
a
jag
after
all
it
was
only
two
thirty
in
the
afternoon
the
other
sister
nelda
did
say
anything
she
merely
stood
and
stared
at
rand
distrustfully
rand
doubted
that
she
ordinarily
gave
men
the
hostile
eye
the
full
lips
the
lush
figure
the
way
she
draped
it
against
the
side
of
the
fireplace
to
catch
the
ruddy
light
on
her
more
interesting
curves
and
bulges
there
was
a
bimbo
just
made
to
be
leered
at
and
she
probably
resented
it
like
hell
if
she
were
rand
gave
them
a
general
then
turned
to
gladys
i
had
a
talk
with
goode
yesterday
afternoon
he
said
i
have
his
authorization
to
handle
all
the
details
as
soon
as
i
get
an
itemized
list
circularize
dealers
and
other
possible
buyers
and
ask
for
offers
is
that
all
nelda
demanded
angrily
of
gladys
why
fred
done
all
that
already
is
that
correct
mrs
fleming
rand
asked
for
the
record
i
told
you
yesterday
what
been
done
gladys
replied
fred
has
talked
to
one
dealer
arnold
rivers
there
has
been
no
inventory
of
any
sort
made
rivers
is
offering
us
ten
thousand
dollars
nelda
retorted
i
do
see
why
you
had
to
bring
this
colonel
into
it
at
all
you
think
he
can
get
us
a
better
offer
if
you
do
you
crazy
ten
thousand
dollars
for
a
collection
that
ought
to
sell
for
five
times
that
in
macy
basement
geraldine
hooted
how
much
is
rivers
slipping
fred
on
the
side
oh
go
back
to
your
bottle
nelda
cried
you
too
drunk
to
know
what
you
talking
about
they
tell
me
colonel
rand
is
a
detective
too
geraldine
continued
maybe
he
can
find
out
why
fred
never
talked
to
stephen
gresham
or
carl
gwinnett
or
anybody
else
except
this
rivers
how
much
fred
getting
out
of
rivers
anyhow
my
god
geraldine
shut
up
nelda
howled
then
she
decided
to
take
direct
notice
of
rand
presence
colonel
rand
i
sorry
to
say
that
in
her
present
condition
my
sister
does
know
what
she
saying
bad
enough
for
my
stepmother
to
bring
an
outsider
into
what
obviously
a
family
matter
but
when
my
sister
begins
making
these
ridiculous
accusations
what
ridiculous
about
them
geraldine
demanded
dumping
another
two
ounces
of
whiskey
into
her
glass
and
freshening
it
with
the
siphon
i
think
rivers
offering
ten
thousand
dollars
for
the
collection
and
fred
thinking
we
accept
it
are
the
only
ridiculous
things
about
it
that
rather
what
i
told
rivers
this
afternoon
rand
put
in
he
seemed
a
bit
upset
about
my
being
brought
into
this
too
but
he
finally
admitted
that
he
was
willing
to
pay
up
to
thousand
dollars
for
the
collection
and
if
he
buys
it
that
exactly
what
it
going
to
cost
him
nelda
fairly
screamed
her
hands
opened
and
closed
spasmodically
she
was
using
a
that
made
rand
think
of
talons
arnold
rivers
told
me
this
afternoon
and
i
quote
i
willing
to
pay
up
to
thousand
dollars
for
that
collection
unquote
rand
said
and
i
can
tell
you
now
that
thousand
dollars
is
just
what
he
will
pay
for
it
unless
i
can
find
somebody
who
willing
to
pay
more
which
is
not
at
all
improbable
geraldine
waved
her
glass
and
toasted
rand
with
it
and
g
ai
hay
brother
gladys
smiled
quickly
at
rand
then
turned
to
nelda
now
i
hope
you
see
why
i
thought
it
wise
to
bring
in
somebody
who
knows
something
about
old
arms
she
said
nelda
evidently
saw
there
was
apparently
nothing
stupid
about
her
and
fred
was
going
to
take
a
miserable
ten
thousand
dollars
the
way
she
said
it
ten
thousand
sounded
like
a
fairly
generous
headwaiter
tip
did
rivers
actually
tell
you
he
pay
rand
gave
as
nearly
verbatim
as
possible
his
conversation
with
the
dealer
and
he
can
afford
it
too
he
finished
he
can
make
a
nice
profit
on
the
collection
at
that
figure
my
god
do
you
mean
the
pistols
are
worth
more
than
that
even
she
wanted
to
know
aghast
certainly
if
you
a
dealer
with
an
established
business
and
customers
all
over
the
country
and
want
to
take
five
or
six
years
to
make
your
profit
rand
replied
if
you
are
and
want
your
money
in
a
hurry
no
that
why
i
was
against
turning
the
collection
over
to
gwinnett
on
a
commission
basis
gladys
said
it
would
take
him
five
years
to
get
everything
sold
nelda
left
the
fireplace
and
advanced
toward
rand
colonel
i
owe
you
an
apology
she
said
i
had
no
idea
father
pistols
were
worth
anywhere
near
that
much
i
do
suppose
fred
did
either
she
frowned
wait
till
she
gets
fred
alone
rand
thought
i
hate
to
be
in
his
spot
you
say
you
acting
on
humphrey
goode
authority
that
right
i
negotiate
the
sale
but
the
money
will
be
paid
directly
to
him
for
distribution
according
to
the
terms
of
your
will
rand
got
out
goode
letter
and
handed
it
to
nelda
she
read
it
carefully
i
see
she
seemed
greatly
relieved
she
was
looking
at
rand
now
as
she
was
accustomed
to
look
at
men
particularly
handsome
who
were
broad
across
the
shoulders
and
narrow
at
the
hips
and
resembled
king
charles
ii
she
was
probably
wondering
if
rand
was
equal
to
old
rowley
in
another
important
respect
i
understand
i
thought
a
dirty
look
aimed
at
gladys
explained
what
she
had
thought
then
her
glance
fell
on
the
bottle
and
siphon
on
the
table
beside
geraldine
chair
and
she
changed
the
subject
by
inquiring
if
colonel
rand
might
like
a
drink
well
let
go
up
to
the
gunroom
gladys
suggested
we
can
have
our
drink
up
there
while
colonel
rand
looking
at
the
pistols
coming
with
us
geraldine
geraldine
rose
not
too
steadily
her
glass
still
in
her
hand
and
took
rand
left
arm
gladys
seeing
nelda
moving
in
on
the
detective
right
took
his
other
arm
nelda
was
barely
successful
in
suppressing
a
look
of
murderous
anger
the
double
doorway
into
the
hall
was
just
wide
enough
for
rand
and
his
two
flankers
to
pass
through
nelda
had
to
fall
in
a
couple
of
paces
rear
of
center
and
was
able
to
come
up
into
line
until
they
were
in
the
hall
upstairs
there
the
gunroom
gladys
pointed
and
that
your
room
over
there
as
she
spoke
walters
came
out
of
the
doorway
she
had
indicated
your
bags
are
unpacked
sir
he
reported
then
he
told
rand
where
he
would
find
his
things
and
where
the
bath
was
there
was
a
brief
discussion
of
drinks
the
butler
received
his
instructions
and
went
down
the
stairway
rand
broke
up
the
feminine
formation
around
him
and
ushered
the
ladies
ahead
of
him
into
the
gunroom
it
was
much
as
he
remembered
it
from
his
visit
of
two
years
before
there
was
a
desk
in
one
corner
and
back
of
it
a
short
workbench
and
there
was
a
long
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
its
top
covered
with
green
baize
upon
which
many
flat
rectangular
boxes
of
hardwood
rested
some
walnut
some
rosewood
some
quartered
oak
each
would
contain
a
pistol
or
pair
of
pistols
with
cleaning
and
loading
tools
in
the
corner
farthest
from
the
desk
he
saw
the
head
of
the
spiral
stairway
from
the
library
below
mentioned
by
gladys
fleming
there
were
ashstands
and
a
couple
of
and
a
number
of
chairs
and
the
old
maple
cobbler
bench
on
which
lane
fleming
had
died
the
only
books
in
the
room
were
in
a
small
case
over
the
workbench
they
were
all
then
he
looked
at
the
walls
on
both
ends
and
on
the
long
inside
wall
the
pistols
hung
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
the
cream
of
a
lifetime
collecting
horizontal
boards
had
been
fixed
to
the
walls
about
four
feet
from
the
floor
and
similar
boards
had
been
placed
five
feet
above
them
between
narrow
vertical
strips
as
wide
as
a
lath
but
twice
as
thick
were
set
rows
of
pistols
were
hung
the
barrels
horizontal
on
pairs
of
these
strips
with
screwhooks
at
grip
and
muzzle
there
were
about
a
hundred
such
vertical
rows
of
pistols
rand
was
still
looking
at
them
when
the
butler
brought
in
the
drinks
when
gladys
told
the
servant
that
that
would
be
all
he
went
out
rather
reluctantly
by
the
spiral
stairs
to
the
library
well
what
do
you
think
of
them
colonel
rand
gladys
asked
rand
tasted
his
whiskey
and
looked
around
it
one
of
the
finest
collections
in
the
country
he
said
i
may
even
be
able
to
find
somebody
who
top
rivers
offer
but
do
be
disappointed
if
i
do
by
the
way
did
anybody
help
fleming
keep
this
stuff
clean
the
room
seems
dry
but
even
so
they
need
an
occasional
oh
walters
was
always
in
here
going
over
the
pistols
nelda
said
he
been
in
here
every
day
lately
i
wonder
if
you
could
spare
him
to
help
me
a
little
i
need
somebody
who
knows
his
way
around
here
at
first
why
of
course
gladys
agreed
he
is
very
busy
in
the
mornings
or
in
the
afternoons
till
close
to
are
you
going
to
start
work
today
i
have
to
i
going
to
see
stephen
gresham
and
his
associates
this
evening
and
i
want
to
know
what
i
talking
about
they
spent
about
fifteen
minutes
over
their
drinks
talking
about
the
collection
rand
and
gladys
did
most
of
the
talking
in
spite
of
best
efforts
to
monopolize
the
conversation
geraldine
after
a
few
minutes
retired
into
her
private
world
and
only
roused
herself
when
her
sister
and
stepmother
were
about
to
leave
when
they
went
out
gladys
promised
to
send
walters
up
directly
rand
heard
her
speaking
to
him
at
the
foot
of
the
main
stairway
chapter
when
walters
entered
rand
had
his
pipe
lit
and
was
walking
slowly
around
the
room
laying
out
the
work
ahead
of
him
roughly
the
earliest
pieces
were
on
the
extreme
left
on
the
short
north
wall
of
the
room
and
the
most
recent
ones
on
the
right
at
the
south
end
this
was
of
course
only
relatively
true
the
pistols
seemed
to
have
been
classified
by
type
in
vertical
rows
and
chronologically
from
top
to
bottom
in
each
row
the
collection
seemed
to
consist
of
a
number
of
intensely
specialized
small
groups
with
a
large
number
of
pistols
of
general
types
added
for
instance
about
midway
on
the
long
east
wall
there
were
some
pistols
from
wheel
lock
to
percussion
there
was
a
collection
of
martials
with
two
rows
of
the
regulation
pistols
flintlock
and
percussion
of
foreign
governments
placed
on
the
left
and
the
collection
of
colts
on
the
right
after
them
came
the
other
types
of
percussion
revolvers
and
the
later
types
it
was
an
arrangement
which
made
sense
from
the
arms
student
point
of
view
and
rand
decided
that
it
would
make
sense
to
the
dealers
and
museums
to
whom
he
intended
sending
lists
he
would
save
time
by
listing
them
as
they
were
hung
on
the
walls
then
there
were
the
cases
between
the
windows
on
the
west
wall
containing
the
ammunition
collection
examples
of
every
type
of
ammunition
and
the
collection
of
and
powder
flasks
and
wheel
lock
spanners
and
assorted
cleaning
and
loading
accessories
all
that
stuff
would
have
to
be
listed
too
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
walters
broke
in
behind
him
fleming
said
that
you
wanted
me
oh
yes
rand
turned
is
this
the
whole
thing
what
on
the
walls
here
yes
sir
there
is
also
a
containing
a
number
of
modern
pistols
and
revolvers
and
several
rifles
and
shotguns
in
the
room
formerly
occupied
by
fleming
but
they
are
not
part
of
the
collection
and
they
are
now
the
personal
property
of
fleming
i
understand
that
she
intends
selling
at
least
some
of
them
on
her
own
account
then
there
is
a
quantity
of
ammunition
and
in
that
closet
under
the
workbench
cartridges
primed
black
and
smokeless
powder
percussion
caps
but
they
are
not
part
of
the
collection
either
i
believe
fleming
wants
to
sell
most
of
that
too
well
i
talk
to
her
about
it
i
may
want
to
buy
some
of
the
ammunition
for
myself
rand
said
so
i
only
need
to
bother
with
on
the
walls
in
this
room
by
the
way
did
fleming
keep
any
sort
of
record
of
his
collection
a
book
or
a
or
anything
like
that
why
no
sir
walters
was
positive
then
he
hedged
if
he
did
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
anything
of
the
sort
fleming
knew
everything
in
this
room
i
seen
him
downstairs
when
somebody
would
ask
him
about
something
close
his
eyes
as
though
trying
to
visualize
and
then
give
a
perfect
description
of
any
pistol
in
the
collection
or
else
he
could
enumerate
all
the
pistols
of
a
certain
type
say
all
the
philadelphia
deringers
or
all
the
allen
pepperboxes
or
all
the
smith
wesson
types
he
had
a
remarkable
memory
for
his
pistols
although
it
was
not
out
of
the
ordinary
otherwise
sir
rand
nodded
any
collector
at
least
any
collector
who
was
a
serious
could
do
that
particularly
if
he
were
a
good
visualizer
and
kept
his
stuff
in
some
systematic
order
at
the
moment
he
could
have
named
and
described
any
or
all
of
his
own
modest
collection
of
two
pistols
and
revolvers
i
was
hoping
he
kept
a
record
he
said
a
great
many
collectors
do
and
it
would
have
helped
me
quite
a
bit
he
made
up
his
mind
to
compile
such
a
record
himself
when
he
got
back
to
new
belfast
it
would
be
a
big
help
to
carter
tipton
when
it
came
time
to
settle
his
own
estate
and
a
man
on
whom
the
reaper
has
scored
as
many
as
on
jeff
rand
should
begin
to
think
of
such
things
and
how
about
writing
materials
and
is
there
a
typewriter
available
there
was
a
cased
portable
was
on
the
floor
beside
the
workbench
walters
showed
him
which
desk
drawers
contained
paper
and
other
things
there
was
rand
noticed
a
loaded
colt
detective
special
in
the
upper
desk
drawer
and
these
phones
the
butler
continued
indicating
them
this
one
is
a
private
outside
phone
it
does
connect
with
any
other
in
the
house
the
other
is
an
extension
it
has
a
buzzer
the
outside
phone
has
a
regular
bell
rand
thanked
him
for
the
information
then
picking
up
a
and
pencil
he
started
on
the
left
of
the
collection
meaning
to
make
a
general
list
and
rough
approximation
of
value
for
use
in
talking
to
gresham
friends
that
evening
tomorrow
he
would
begin
on
the
detailed
list
for
use
in
soliciting
outside
offers
wheel
locks
four
heavy
south
german
dags
two
singles
and
a
pair
three
saxon
pistols
with
sharply
dropped
grips
a
pair
and
one
single
five
french
and
italian
pistols
a
pair
of
small
pocket
or
sash
pistols
a
pair
of
french
petronels
and
an
extremely
long
dutch
pistol
with
an
stock
and
a
carved
ivory
for
a
pommel
eight
french
italian
and
flemish
pistols
rand
noted
them
down
and
was
about
to
pass
on
then
he
looked
sharply
at
one
of
them
it
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
as
wheel
locks
go
a
long
flemish
weapon
of
about
the
type
used
by
the
royalist
cavalry
in
the
english
civil
war
there
were
two
others
almost
like
it
but
this
one
was
in
simply
appalling
condition
the
metal
was
rough
with
rust
and
apparently
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
clean
it
in
a
couple
of
centuries
there
was
a
piece
cracked
out
of
the
the
ramrod
was
missing
as
was
the
front
both
the
and
the
were
loose
and
when
rand
touched
the
wheel
it
revolved
freely
if
sluggishly
betraying
a
broken
spring
or
chain
the
vertical
row
next
to
it
seemed
to
be
all
snaphaunces
but
among
them
rand
saw
a
pair
of
turkish
flintlocks
not
even
good
turkish
flintlocks
a
pair
of
the
sort
of
weapons
hastily
thrown
together
by
native
craftsmen
or
imported
from
belgium
for
bazaar
sale
to
gullible
tourists
among
the
fine
examples
of
brescian
gunmaking
above
and
below
it
these
things
looked
like
a
pair
of
dogpatchers
in
the
waldorf
starlight
room
rand
contemplated
them
with
distaste
then
shrugged
after
all
they
might
have
had
some
sentimental
significance
say
souvenirs
of
a
pleasantly
remembered
trip
to
the
levant
a
few
rows
farther
on
among
some
exceptionally
fine
flintlocks
all
of
which
he
saw
one
of
those
big
belgian
navy
pistols
of
the
sort
once
advertised
far
and
wide
by
a
certain
dealer
for
this
was
a
particularly
repulsive
specimen
of
its
breed
grimy
with
hardened
dust
and
gummed
oil
maculated
with
the
brasswork
green
with
corrosion
it
was
impossible
to
shrug
off
a
thing
like
that
from
then
on
rand
kept
his
eyes
open
for
similar
incongruities
they
were
hard
to
find
there
was
a
big
army
pistol
of
central
european
origin
and
in
abominable
condition
among
a
row
of
fine
flintlocks
stephen
gresham
had
mentioned
an
elisha
collier
flintlock
revolver
it
was
there
it
should
be
hanging
about
where
this
german
thing
was
there
was
no
hall
either
but
there
was
a
dilapidated
old
ketland
there
were
many
such
interlopers
among
the
martials
an
english
cavalry
pistol
a
french
and
a
french
a
couple
more
specials
a
miserable
altered
north
among
the
colts
there
was
some
awful
junk
including
a
big
spanish
and
a
belgian
imitation
of
a
webley
model
there
were
as
many
paterson
colts
as
gresham
had
spoken
of
and
the
whitneyville
walker
was
absent
it
went
on
like
that
about
a
dozen
of
the
best
pistols
which
rand
remembered
having
seen
from
two
years
ago
were
gone
and
he
spotted
at
least
twenty
items
which
the
late
lane
fleming
would
have
hung
in
his
backyard
privy
if
he
had
one
well
that
was
to
be
expected
the
way
these
pistols
were
arranged
the
absence
of
one
from
its
hooks
would
have
been
instantly
obvious
so
as
the
good
stuff
had
moved
out
these
disreputable
changelings
had
moved
in
you
had
rather
a
shocking
experience
here
in
fleming
death
rand
said
over
his
shoulder
to
the
butler
oh
yes
indeed
sir
walters
seemed
relieved
that
rand
had
broken
the
silence
a
great
loss
to
all
of
us
sir
and
so
unexpected
he
did
seem
averse
to
talking
about
it
and
went
on
at
some
length
his
story
closely
paralleled
that
of
gladys
fleming
varcek
called
the
doctor
immediately
he
said
then
dunmore
pointed
out
that
the
doctor
would
be
obliged
to
notify
either
the
coroner
or
the
police
so
he
called
goode
the
family
solicitor
that
was
about
twenty
minutes
after
the
shot
goode
arrived
directly
he
was
here
in
about
ten
minutes
i
must
say
sir
i
was
glad
to
see
him
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
been
afraid
that
the
authorities
might
claim
that
fleming
had
shot
himself
deliberately
somebody
else
does
like
the
smell
of
that
accident
rand
thought
aloud
he
said
goode
lives
nearby
then
i
take
it
oh
yes
sir
you
can
see
his
house
from
these
windows
over
here
sir
rand
looked
out
the
window
the
lawn
of
the
fleming
residence
ended
about
a
hundred
yards
to
the
west
beyond
it
an
orchard
was
beginning
to
break
into
leaf
and
beyond
the
orchard
and
another
lawn
stood
a
house
somewhat
smaller
than
the
fleming
place
a
path
led
down
from
it
to
the
orchard
and
another
led
from
the
orchard
to
the
rear
of
the
house
from
which
rand
looked
must
be
comforting
to
know
your
lawyer
so
handy
he
commented
and
what
do
you
think
walters
are
you
satisfied
in
your
own
mind
that
fleming
was
killed
accidentally
the
servant
looked
at
him
seriously
no
sir
i
not
he
replied
i
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
since
it
happened
sir
and
i
just
ca
believe
that
fleming
would
have
that
revolver
and
start
working
on
it
without
knowing
that
it
was
loaded
that
just
possible
if
you
pardon
me
sir
and
i
ca
understand
how
he
would
have
shot
himself
while
removing
the
charges
the
fact
is
when
i
came
up
here
at
quarter
of
seven
to
call
him
for
cocktails
he
had
the
whole
thing
apart
and
spread
out
in
front
of
him
the
butler
thought
for
a
moment
i
believe
dunmore
had
something
like
that
in
mind
when
he
called
mr
goode
well
what
happened
rand
asked
did
the
coroner
or
the
doctor
choke
on
calling
it
an
accident
oh
no
sir
there
was
no
trouble
of
any
sort
about
that
you
see
yardman
called
the
coroner
as
soon
as
he
arrived
but
goode
was
here
already
he
come
over
by
that
path
you
saw
to
the
rear
of
the
house
and
in
through
the
garage
which
was
open
since
dunmore
was
out
with
the
coupé
they
all
talked
it
over
for
a
while
and
the
coroner
decided
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
inquest
and
the
doctor
wrote
out
the
certificate
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
rand
looked
at
the
section
of
devoted
to
colts
which
one
was
it
he
asked
oh
it
not
here
sir
walters
replied
the
coroner
took
it
away
with
him
and
has
returned
it
yet
well
he
has
no
business
keeping
it
part
of
the
collection
and
belongs
to
the
estate
yes
sir
if
i
may
say
so
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
of
him
taking
it
away
myself
but
it
was
my
place
to
say
anything
about
it
well
i
make
it
mine
if
that
revolver
what
i
told
it
is
too
valuable
to
let
some
damned
politician
walk
off
with
a
thought
occurred
to
him
and
if
i
find
that
he
disposed
of
it
this
county
going
to
need
a
new
coroner
at
least
till
the
present
incumbent
gets
out
of
jail
the
buzzer
of
the
extension
phone
went
off
like
an
annoyed
rattlesnake
walters
scooped
it
up
spoke
into
it
listened
for
a
moment
and
handed
it
to
rand
for
you
sir
mrs
fleming
colonel
rand
carl
gwinnett
the
i
told
you
about
is
here
gladys
told
him
do
you
want
to
talk
to
him
why
yes
do
i
understand
now
that
you
and
the
other
ladies
want
cash
and
do
want
the
collection
peddled
off
piecemeal
all
right
send
him
up
i
talk
to
him
a
few
minutes
later
a
short
man
of
entered
the
gunroom
shifting
a
brief
case
to
his
left
hand
and
extending
his
right
rand
advanced
to
meet
him
and
shook
hands
with
him
you
colonel
rand
enjoyed
your
articles
in
the
he
said
fleming
tells
me
you
handling
the
sale
of
the
collection
for
the
estate
that
right
gwinnett
fleming
tells
me
you
interested
yes
originally
i
offered
to
sell
the
collection
for
her
on
a
commission
basis
but
she
did
seem
to
care
for
the
idea
and
neither
do
the
other
ladies
they
all
want
spot
cash
in
a
lump
sum
yes
fleming
herself
might
have
been
interested
in
your
proposition
if
she
been
sole
owner
you
could
probably
get
more
for
the
collection
even
after
deducting
your
commission
than
i
be
able
to
but
the
collection
belongs
to
the
estate
and
has
to
be
sold
before
any
division
can
be
made
yes
i
see
that
well
how
much
would
the
estate
or
you
consider
a
reasonable
offer
sit
down
gwinnett
rand
invited
what
would
you
consider
a
reasonable
offer
yourself
we
not
asking
any
specific
price
just
taking
bids
as
it
were
well
how
much
have
you
been
offered
to
date
well
we
have
heard
from
everybody
in
fact
we
have
put
out
a
list
or
solicited
offers
except
locally
as
yet
but
one
gentleman
has
expressed
a
willingness
to
pay
up
to
thousand
dollars
gwinnett
face
expressed
polite
skepticism
colonel
rand
he
protested
you
certainly
do
take
an
offer
like
that
seriously
i
think
it
was
made
seriously
rand
replied
a
respectable
profit
could
be
made
on
the
collection
even
at
that
price
gwinnett
eyes
shifted
over
the
rows
of
horizontal
barrels
on
the
walls
he
was
almost
visibly
wrestling
with
mental
arithmetic
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
keep
any
hint
of
his
notion
of
the
collection
real
value
out
of
his
face
well
i
doubt
if
i
could
raise
that
much
he
said
might
i
ask
making
this
offer
you
might
i
afraid
i
could
tell
you
you
would
want
me
to
publish
your
own
offer
broadcast
would
you
i
think
i
can
guess
if
i
right
do
hold
your
head
in
a
tub
of
water
till
you
get
it
gwinnett
advised
making
a
big
offer
to
scare
away
competition
is
one
thing
and
paying
off
on
it
is
another
i
seen
that
happen
before
you
know
fact
is
there
one
dealer
not
far
from
here
who
makes
a
regular
habit
of
it
he
make
some
fantastic
offer
and
then
when
everybody
been
bluffed
out
he
start
making
objections
and
finding
faults
and
before
long
he
be
down
to
about
a
quarter
of
his
original
price
the
practice
is
unknown
rand
admitted
i
bet
you
do
have
this
thousand
dollar
offer
on
paper
over
a
signature
gwinnett
pursued
well
here
he
opened
his
brief
case
and
extracted
a
sheet
of
paper
handing
it
to
rand
you
can
file
this
i
stand
back
of
it
rand
looked
at
the
typed
and
signed
statement
to
the
effect
that
carl
gwinnett
agreed
to
pay
the
sum
of
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
the
lane
fleming
in
its
entirety
within
thirty
days
of
date
that
was
an
average
of
six
dollars
a
pistol
there
had
been
a
time
not
too
long
ago
when
a
with
an
average
value
of
six
dollars
particularly
one
as
large
as
the
fleming
collection
had
been
something
unusual
for
one
thing
arms
values
had
increased
sharply
in
the
meantime
for
another
lane
fleming
had
kept
his
collection
clean
of
the
items
which
dragged
down
so
many
collectors
average
values
except
for
the
mysterious
interlopers
there
a
pistol
in
the
fleming
collection
that
was
worth
at
least
twenty
dollars
and
quite
a
few
had
values
expressible
in
three
figures
well
your
offer
is
duly
received
and
filed
gwinnett
rand
told
him
folding
the
sheet
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
this
is
better
than
an
unwitnessed
verbal
statement
that
somebody
is
willing
to
pay
thousand
i
certainly
bear
you
in
mind
you
can
show
that
to
arnold
rivers
if
you
want
to
gwinnett
said
see
how
much
he
willing
to
commit
himself
to
over
his
signature
chapter
cocktails
in
the
library
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
household
rite
a
truce
of
bacchus
before
the
resumption
of
hostilities
in
the
it
lasted
from
six
to
seven
everybody
sipped
manhattans
and
kept
quiet
and
listened
to
the
radio
newscast
the
only
new
face
to
rand
was
fred
dunmore
it
was
a
smooth
face
decorated
with
octagonal
rimless
glasses
an
entirely
unremarkable
face
the
face
of
the
type
that
used
to
be
labeled
babbitt
the
corner
of
rand
mind
that
handled
such
data
subconsciously
filed
his
description
to
fifty
five
feet
eight
hair
brown
and
thinning
eyes
blue
to
this
he
added
the
rotarian
button
on
the
lapel
and
the
small
gold
globule
on
the
watch
chain
that
testified
that
when
his
age
and
weight
had
been
considerably
less
dunmore
had
played
on
somebody
basketball
team
at
that
time
he
had
probably
belonged
to
the
and
had
thought
that
mussolini
was
doing
a
splendid
job
in
italy
that
mencken
ought
to
be
deported
to
russia
and
that
prohibition
was
here
to
stay
at
company
sales
meetings
he
probably
radiated
an
aura
of
synthetic
as
rand
followed
walters
down
the
spiral
from
the
gunroom
the
radio
commercial
was
just
starting
and
geraldine
was
asking
dunmore
where
anton
was
oh
you
know
dunmore
told
her
impatiently
he
had
to
go
to
louisburg
to
that
medical
association
meeting
he
reading
a
paper
about
the
new
diabetic
ration
he
broke
off
as
rand
approached
and
was
introduced
by
gladys
who
handed
both
men
their
cocktails
then
the
news
commentator
greeted
them
out
of
the
radio
and
everybody
absorbed
the
day
news
along
with
their
manhattans
after
the
broadcast
they
all
crossed
the
hall
to
the
where
hostilities
began
almost
before
the
soup
was
cool
enough
to
taste
i
do
see
why
you
women
had
to
do
this
dunmore
huffed
rivers
has
made
us
a
fair
offer
bringing
in
an
outsider
will
only
give
him
the
impression
that
we
lack
confidence
in
him
well
wo
that
be
just
too
too
bad
geraldine
slashed
at
him
we
must
ever
hurt
dear
rivers
feelings
like
that
let
him
have
the
collection
for
half
what
it
worth
but
never
never
let
him
think
we
know
what
a
crook
he
is
dunmore
evidently
did
think
that
worth
dignifying
with
an
answer
doubtless
he
expected
nelda
to
launch
a
as
a
matter
of
principle
if
he
did
he
was
disappointed
well
nelda
demanded
what
did
you
want
us
to
do
give
the
collection
away
you
do
understand
dunmore
told
her
you
probably
heard
somebody
say
what
the
collection
worth
and
you
never
stopped
to
realize
that
it
only
worth
that
to
a
dealer
who
can
sell
it
item
by
item
you
expect
we
can
expect
a
lot
more
than
ten
thousand
dollars
nelda
retorted
in
fact
we
can
expect
more
than
that
from
rivers
colonel
rand
was
talking
to
rivers
this
afternoon
colonel
rand
does
have
any
confidence
in
rivers
at
all
and
he
does
care
who
knows
it
you
were
talking
to
arnold
rivers
this
afternoon
about
the
collection
dunmore
demanded
of
rand
that
right
rand
confirmed
i
told
him
his
ten
thousand
dollar
offer
was
a
joke
stephen
gresham
and
his
friends
can
top
that
out
of
one
pocket
finally
he
got
around
to
admitting
that
he
willing
to
pay
up
to
thousand
i
do
believe
it
dunmore
exclaimed
angrily
rivers
told
me
personally
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
dealer
could
hope
to
handle
that
collection
profitably
at
more
than
ten
thousand
and
you
believed
that
nelda
demanded
and
you
a
business
man
god
he
probably
a
good
one
as
long
as
he
sticks
to
pancake
flour
geraldine
was
generous
enough
to
concede
but
about
guns
he
barely
knows
which
end
the
bullet
comes
out
at
ten
thousand
was
probably
his
idea
of
what
we
think
the
pistols
were
worth
dunmore
ignored
that
and
turned
to
rand
did
arnold
rivers
actually
tell
you
he
pay
thousand
dollars
for
the
collection
he
asked
i
ca
believe
that
he
raise
his
own
offer
like
that
he
did
raise
his
offer
i
threw
it
out
and
told
him
to
make
one
that
could
be
taken
seriously
rand
repeated
as
closely
as
he
could
his
conversation
with
the
when
he
had
finished
dunmore
was
frowning
in
puzzled
displeasure
and
you
think
he
actually
willing
to
pay
that
much
yes
i
do
if
he
handles
them
right
he
can
double
his
money
on
the
pistols
inside
of
five
years
i
doubt
if
you
realize
how
valuable
those
pistols
are
you
probably
defined
fleming
collection
as
a
and
therefore
something
not
to
be
taken
seriously
and
aside
from
the
actual
profit
the
prestige
of
handling
this
collection
would
be
worth
a
good
deal
to
rivers
as
advertising
i
have
the
least
doubt
that
he
can
raise
the
money
or
that
he
willing
to
pay
it
dunmore
was
still
frowning
maybe
he
hated
being
proved
wrong
in
front
of
the
women
of
the
family
and
you
think
gresham
and
his
friends
will
offer
enough
to
force
him
to
pay
the
full
amount
rand
laughed
and
told
him
to
stop
being
naïve
he
done
that
himself
and
what
more
he
knows
it
when
he
told
me
he
was
willing
to
go
as
high
as
thousand
he
fixed
the
price
unless
somebody
offers
more
which
is
impossible
but
maybe
he
just
bluffing
dunmore
seemed
to
be
following
line
of
thought
after
he
bluffed
gresham
crowd
out
maybe
he
go
back
to
his
original
ten
thousand
offer
fred
please
stop
talking
about
that
ten
thousand
dollars
geraldine
interrupted
how
much
did
rivers
actually
tell
you
he
pay
thousand
like
he
did
colonel
rand
dunmore
turned
in
his
chair
angrily
now
look
here
he
shouted
there
a
limit
to
what
i
got
to
take
from
you
he
stopped
short
as
nelda
beside
him
moved
slightly
and
his
words
ended
in
something
that
sounded
like
a
smothered
moan
rand
suspected
that
she
had
kicked
her
husband
painfully
under
the
table
then
walters
came
in
with
the
meat
course
and
firing
ceased
until
the
butler
had
retired
by
the
way
rand
tossed
into
the
conversational
vacuum
that
followed
his
exit
does
anybody
know
anything
about
a
record
fleming
kept
of
his
collection
why
no
ca
say
i
do
dunmore
replied
promptly
evidently
grateful
for
the
change
of
subject
you
mean
like
an
inventory
oh
fred
you
do
nelda
told
him
impatiently
you
know
that
big
gray
book
father
kept
all
his
pistols
entered
in
it
was
a
gray
ledger
with
a
black
leather
back
gladys
said
he
kept
it
in
the
little
bookcase
over
the
workbench
in
the
gunroom
i
look
for
it
rand
said
sure
it
still
there
it
would
be
a
big
help
to
me
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
in
relative
tranquillity
the
conversation
proceeded
in
fairly
safe
channels
dunmore
was
anxious
to
avoid
any
further
reference
to
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
when
gladys
induced
rand
to
talk
about
his
military
experiences
he
lapsed
into
preoccupied
silence
several
times
geraldine
and
nelda
aimed
halfhearted
feline
swipes
at
one
another
more
out
of
custom
than
present
and
active
rancor
the
women
seemed
to
have
erected
a
temporary
finally
the
meal
ended
and
the
diners
drifted
away
from
the
table
rand
went
to
his
room
for
a
few
moments
then
went
to
the
gunroom
to
get
the
notes
he
had
made
fred
dunmore
was
using
the
private
phone
as
he
entered
well
never
mind
about
that
now
he
was
saying
we
talk
about
it
when
i
see
you
yes
of
course
so
am
i
well
say
about
eleven
be
seeing
you
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
rand
more
union
trouble
he
said
it
enough
to
make
a
saint
lose
his
religion
our
are
organized
in
the
and
our
warehouse
sales
and
shipping
personnel
are
in
the
of
and
if
they
are
fighting
the
company
fighting
each
other
now
they
have
some
damn
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
dispute
i
do
know
what
this
country
coming
to
he
glared
angrily
through
his
octagonal
glasses
for
a
moment
then
his
voice
took
on
an
ingratiating
note
look
here
colonel
i
just
did
understand
the
situation
until
you
explained
it
i
hope
you
are
taking
anything
that
of
mine
said
seriously
she
just
blurts
out
the
first
thing
that
comes
into
her
mind
why
only
yesterday
she
was
accusing
gladys
of
bringing
you
into
this
to
help
her
gyp
the
rest
of
us
and
before
that
oh
forget
it
rand
dismissed
geraldine
with
a
shrug
i
know
she
was
talking
through
a
highball
glass
as
far
as
selling
the
collection
is
concerned
you
just
let
rivers
sell
you
a
bill
of
something
you
gotten
a
good
look
at
he
a
smart
operator
and
he
crooked
as
a
of
blacksnakes
maybe
you
never
realized
just
how
much
money
fleming
put
into
this
collection
naturally
you
would
realize
how
much
could
be
gotten
out
of
it
again
a
lot
of
this
stuff
has
been
here
for
quite
a
while
and
antiques
of
any
kind
tend
to
increase
in
value
well
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
just
as
glad
as
anybody
if
you
can
get
a
better
price
out
of
him
than
i
could
dunmore
smiled
ruefully
i
guess
he
just
a
better
poker
player
than
i
am
not
necessarily
he
could
see
your
hand
and
you
could
see
his
rand
told
him
you
going
to
see
gresham
and
his
friends
this
evening
dunmore
asked
well
when
you
get
back
if
you
find
four
cars
in
the
garage
counting
the
lock
up
after
you
put
your
own
car
away
if
you
find
only
three
then
you
know
that
anton
varcek
still
out
so
leave
it
open
for
him
that
the
way
we
do
here
last
one
in
locks
up
chapter
rand
found
another
car
a
plymouth
coupé
standing
on
the
left
of
his
lincoln
when
he
went
down
to
the
garage
running
his
car
outside
and
down
to
the
highway
he
settled
down
to
his
regular
style
of
driving
a
barely
legal
fifty
punctuated
by
bursts
of
absolutely
felonious
speed
whenever
he
found
an
unobstructed
straightaway
entering
rosemont
he
slowed
and
went
through
the
underpass
at
the
railroad
tracks
speeding
again
when
he
was
clear
of
the
village
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
turning
into
the
drive
that
led
up
to
the
gresham
house
a
girl
met
him
at
the
door
a
cute
little
redhead
in
a
dress
who
gave
him
a
smile
that
seemed
to
start
on
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
lift
her
whole
face
up
after
it
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
colonel
rand
she
exclaimed
i
bet
you
do
remember
me
sure
i
do
you
dot
rand
said
at
least
i
think
you
are
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
in
pigtails
and
you
were
only
about
so
high
he
measured
with
his
hand
the
last
time
i
was
here
you
were
away
at
school
you
must
be
old
enough
to
vote
by
now
i
will
this
fall
she
replied
come
on
in
you
the
first
one
here
daddy
has
gotten
back
from
town
yet
he
called
and
said
be
delayed
till
about
nine
in
the
hall
she
took
his
hat
and
coat
and
guided
him
toward
the
parlor
on
the
right
oh
mother
she
called
here
colonel
rand
rand
remembered
irene
gresham
too
an
dizzy
blonde
who
was
still
living
in
the
flaming
youth
era
of
the
twenties
she
was
an
extremely
good
egg
he
liked
her
very
much
after
all
insisting
upon
remaining
an
scott
fitzgerald
character
was
a
harmless
and
amusing
foible
and
it
was
no
more
than
right
that
somebody
should
try
to
keep
the
bright
banner
of
jazz
age
innocence
flying
in
a
grim
and
sullen
world
he
accepted
a
cigarette
shared
the
flame
of
his
lighter
with
mother
and
daughter
and
submitted
to
being
gushed
over
and
honestly
jeff
you
get
handsomer
every
year
irene
gresham
rattled
on
dot
does
he
look
just
like
clark
gable
in
with
the
but
then
of
course
jeff
really
a
southerner
so
the
doorbell
interrupted
this
slight
she
broke
off
rising
sit
still
jeff
i
just
going
to
see
who
it
is
you
know
we
down
to
only
one
servant
now
and
it
seems
as
if
it
always
her
night
off
or
something
i
do
know
honestly
what
i
going
to
do
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
voices
sounded
in
the
hall
a
man
and
a
girl
that
pierre
and
karen
dot
said
let
all
go
up
in
the
gunroom
and
wait
for
the
others
there
they
went
out
to
meet
the
newcomers
the
man
was
a
few
inches
shorter
than
rand
with
gray
eyes
that
looked
startlingly
light
against
the
dark
brown
of
his
face
he
was
using
a
cane
but
he
walked
with
a
slight
limp
beside
him
was
a
slender
girl
almost
as
tall
as
he
was
with
dark
brown
hair
and
brown
eyes
she
wore
a
sweater
and
a
brown
skirt
and
irene
gresham
went
into
the
introductions
the
newcomers
shook
hands
with
rand
and
were
advised
that
the
style
of
address
was
jeff
rather
than
colonel
rand
and
then
dot
suggested
going
up
to
the
gunroom
irene
gresham
said
she
stay
downstairs
she
have
to
let
the
others
in
have
you
seen
this
collection
before
pierre
jarrett
inquired
as
he
and
rand
went
upstairs
together
about
two
years
ago
rand
said
stephen
had
just
gotten
a
cased
dueling
set
by
wilkinson
then
from
the
far
west
hobby
shop
i
think
oh
he
gotten
a
lot
of
new
stuff
since
then
and
sold
off
about
a
dozen
culls
and
duplicates
the
former
marine
said
i
show
you
what
new
till
the
others
come
they
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
started
down
the
hall
to
the
gunroom
in
the
wing
that
projected
out
over
the
garage
along
the
way
the
girls
detached
themselves
for
unlike
the
room
at
the
fleming
home
stephen
gresham
gunroom
had
originally
been
something
else
a
nursery
or
or
there
were
windows
on
both
long
sides
which
considerably
reduced
the
available
and
the
situation
was
helped
any
by
the
fact
that
the
collection
was
about
thirty
per
cent
things
were
pretty
badly
crowded
most
of
the
rifles
and
muskets
were
in
circular
away
from
the
walls
here
this
one
new
since
you
were
here
pierre
said
picking
a
long
musket
from
one
of
the
racks
and
handing
it
to
rand
how
do
you
like
this
one
rand
took
it
and
whistled
appreciatively
real
european
matchlock
no
i
never
saw
that
looks
like
north
italian
say
to
about
that
musket
pierre
informed
him
came
over
on
the
really
or
just
a
gag
rand
asked
it
easily
could
have
the
company
bought
their
muskets
in
holland
from
some
forerunner
of
bannerman
and
europe
was
full
of
muskets
like
this
then
left
over
from
the
wars
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
the
french
religious
wars
yes
i
suppose
all
their
muskets
were
obsolete
types
for
the
period
pierre
agreed
well
that
a
real
arm
stephen
has
the
documentation
for
it
it
came
from
the
charles
winthrop
sawyer
collection
and
there
were
only
three
ownership
changes
between
the
last
owner
and
the
company
stephen
only
paid
a
hundred
dollars
for
it
too
that
was
practically
stealing
rand
said
he
carried
the
musket
to
the
light
and
examined
it
closely
nice
condition
too
i
would
be
afraid
to
fire
this
with
a
full
charge
right
now
he
handed
the
weapon
back
he
did
lose
a
thing
on
that
deal
i
should
say
not
i
give
him
two
hundred
for
it
any
time
even
without
the
history
it
worth
that
who
buys
history
anyhow
rand
wanted
to
know
the
fact
that
it
came
from
the
sawyer
collection
adds
more
value
to
it
than
this
business
past
ownership
by
a
recognized
authority
like
sawyer
is
a
real
guarantee
of
quality
and
authenticity
but
history
documented
or
otherwise
hell
only
yesterday
i
saw
a
pair
of
pistols
with
a
wonderful
documented
history
only
not
a
word
of
it
was
true
the
pistols
were
made
about
twenty
years
ago
those
wheel
locks
fleming
bought
from
arnold
rivers
pierre
asked
god
was
that
a
crime
i
bet
rivers
bought
himself
a
big
drink
when
lane
fleming
was
killed
fleming
was
all
set
to
hang
rivers
scalp
in
his
wigwam
but
with
stephen
the
history
does
count
for
something
as
you
probably
know
he
collects
that
figured
in
american
history
well
he
can
prove
that
this
individual
musket
was
brought
over
by
the
pilgrims
so
he
can
be
sure
it
an
example
of
the
type
they
used
but
he
sooner
have
a
typical
pilgrim
musket
that
never
was
within
five
thousand
miles
of
plymouth
rock
than
a
arm
brought
over
as
a
personal
weapon
by
one
of
the
company
oh
none
of
us
are
really
interested
in
the
individual
history
of
collection
weapons
rand
said
you
show
me
a
collection
that
full
of
arms
and
i
show
you
a
collection
that
either
full
of
junk
or
else
cost
three
times
what
it
worth
and
you
show
me
a
collector
who
blows
money
on
history
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
i
show
you
a
collector
who
does
know
guns
i
saw
one
such
collection
once
every
item
had
its
history
neatly
written
out
on
a
tag
and
hung
onto
the
the
owner
thought
that
the
on
colts
were
and
the
on
french
military
arms
were
dates
of
fabrication
pierre
wrinkled
his
nose
disgustedly
god
i
hate
to
see
a
collection
all
fouled
up
with
tags
hung
on
things
he
said
or
stuck
over
with
gummed
labels
that
even
worse
once
in
a
while
i
get
something
with
a
label
pasted
on
it
usually
on
the
stock
and
after
i
get
it
off
a
job
getting
the
wood
under
it
rubbed
up
to
the
same
color
as
the
rest
of
the
stock
yes
i
picked
up
a
lovely
little
rifled
flintlock
pistol
once
rand
said
american
stock
really
a
kentucky
rifle
in
pistol
form
whoever
had
owned
it
before
me
had
pasted
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
underside
of
the
stock
between
the
and
the
lower
ramrod
thimble
with
a
lot
of
crap
mostly
erroneous
typed
on
it
it
took
me
six
months
to
remove
the
last
traces
of
where
that
thing
had
been
stuck
on
what
do
you
collect
or
do
you
specialize
pistols
i
try
to
get
the
best
possible
specimens
of
the
most
important
types
special
emphasis
on
british
arms
after
and
american
arms
after
what
i
interested
in
is
the
evolution
of
the
pistol
i
have
a
couple
of
wheel
locks
to
start
with
and
three
and
an
italian
snaphaunce
then
i
have
a
few
early
flintlocks
and
a
number
of
types
and
some
late
flintlocks
and
percussion
types
and
about
twenty
colts
and
so
on
through
percussion
revolvers
and
early
cartridge
types
to
some
modern
arms
including
a
few
world
war
ii
arms
i
see
about
the
same
idea
lane
fleming
had
pierre
said
i
collect
personal
firearms
and
arms
that
either
influenced
fighting
techniques
or
were
developed
to
meet
special
combat
conditions
from
what
you
say
you
mainly
interested
in
the
way
firearms
were
designed
and
made
i
interested
in
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
used
and
adam
trehearne
who
be
here
shortly
collects
pistols
and
a
few
in
wheel
lock
and
early
flintlock
to
and
philip
cabot
collects
martials
flintlock
to
automatic
and
also
enemy
and
allied
army
weapons
from
all
our
wars
and
colin
macbride
collects
nothing
but
colts
odd
how
a
scot
who
only
been
in
this
country
twenty
years
should
become
interested
in
so
distinctively
american
a
type
and
i
collect
anything
i
can
sell
at
a
profit
from
chinese
matchlocks
to
karen
lawrence
interjected
coming
into
the
room
with
dot
gresham
pierre
grinned
karen
is
practically
a
unique
specimen
herself
the
only
dealer
i
ever
seen
who
does
hate
the
sight
of
a
that
only
because
i
crazy
enough
to
want
to
marry
one
the
girl
dealer
replied
of
all
the
miserly
unscrupulous
grasping
characters
she
expressed
a
doubt
that
the
average
would
pay
more
than
ten
cents
to
see
his
lord
and
savior
riding
to
hounds
on
a
they
do
give
a
hoot
whose
grandfather
owned
what
and
if
anything
battered
up
a
little
they
do
think
it
looks
quaint
they
think
it
looks
lousy
and
they
never
heard
of
inflation
they
think
arms
ought
still
to
sell
for
the
sort
of
prices
they
brought
at
the
old
mark
field
sale
back
in
what
were
you
looking
at
dot
asked
rand
then
glanced
at
the
musket
in
pierre
hands
oh
priscilla
karen
laughed
dot
not
only
knows
everything
in
the
collection
she
knows
it
by
name
dot
show
colonel
rand
hester
prynne
hester
coming
up
gresham
daughter
said
catching
another
musket
out
of
the
same
rack
from
which
pierre
had
gotten
the
matchlock
and
passing
it
over
to
rand
he
grasped
the
heavy
piece
approving
of
the
easy
instinctive
way
in
which
the
girl
had
handled
it
look
on
the
barrel
she
told
him
on
top
right
at
the
breech
the
gun
was
a
flintlock
or
rather
a
sure
enough
stamped
on
the
breech
was
the
big
a
of
the
company
of
workmen
armorers
of
london
the
gunmakers
guild
that
right
he
nodded
that
hester
prynne
all
right
the
first
american
girl
to
make
her
letter
there
were
footsteps
in
the
hall
outside
and
male
voices
adam
and
colin
pierre
recognized
them
before
they
entered
both
men
were
past
fifty
colin
macbride
was
a
black
highlander
black
eyes
black
hair
and
a
black
mustache
from
under
which
a
stubby
pipe
jutted
except
when
he
emptied
it
of
ashes
and
refilled
it
it
was
a
permanent
fixture
of
his
face
trehearne
was
somewhat
shorter
and
fair
his
sandy
mustache
beginning
to
turn
gray
at
the
edges
was
clipped
to
micrometric
exactness
they
shook
hands
with
rand
who
set
hester
back
in
her
place
trehearne
took
the
matchlock
out
of
pierre
hands
and
looked
at
it
wistfully
some
chaps
have
all
the
luck
he
commented
what
do
you
think
of
it
mr
rand
pierre
who
had
made
the
introductions
had
respected
the
detective
present
civilian
status
or
do
you
collect
i
do
collect
them
but
i
interested
in
anything
that
shoot
that
a
good
one
those
things
are
scarce
too
yes
you
find
a
hundred
wheel
locks
for
every
matchlock
and
yet
there
must
have
been
a
hundred
matchlocks
made
for
every
wheel
lock
matchlocks
were
cheap
and
wheel
locks
were
expensive
macbride
suggested
he
spoke
with
the
faintest
trace
of
highland
accent
naturally
they
got
better
care
it
would
take
a
scot
to
think
of
that
karen
said
now
you
take
a
scot
who
collects
guns
and
you
have
something
that
only
part
of
it
rand
said
i
believe
that
by
the
last
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
most
of
the
matchlocks
that
were
lying
around
had
been
scrapped
and
the
barrels
used
in
making
flintlocks
hester
prynne
over
there
could
easily
have
started
her
career
as
a
matchlock
and
then
a
great
many
matchlocks
went
into
the
west
african
slave
and
ivory
trade
and
were
promptly
ruined
by
the
natives
yes
and
i
seem
to
recall
having
seen
spanish
and
french
miguelet
muskets
that
looked
as
though
they
had
been
altered
directly
from
matchlock
retaining
the
original
stock
and
even
the
original
trehearne
added
so
have
i
come
to
think
of
it
rand
stole
a
glance
at
his
it
was
nine
five
he
was
wishing
stephen
gresham
would
put
in
an
appearance
macbride
and
trehearne
joined
pierre
and
the
girls
in
showing
him
gresham
collection
evidently
they
all
knew
it
almost
as
well
as
their
own
after
a
while
irene
gresham
ushered
in
philip
cabot
he
too
was
past
middle
age
with
prematurely
white
hair
and
a
thin
scholarly
face
according
to
hollywood
he
might
have
been
a
professor
or
a
judge
or
a
boston
brahmin
but
never
a
stockbroker
irene
gresham
wanted
to
know
what
everybody
wanted
to
drink
rand
wanted
bourbon
and
plain
water
macbride
voted
for
jamaica
rum
trehearne
and
cabot
favored
brandy
and
soda
and
pierre
and
the
girls
wanted
bacardi
and
and
stephen
want
rye
and
soda
when
he
gets
here
irene
said
come
on
girls
let
rustle
up
the
drinks
before
they
returned
stephen
gresham
came
in
lighting
a
cigar
it
was
just
nine
well
i
see
everybody
here
he
said
no
where
karen
pierre
told
him
a
few
minutes
later
the
women
returned
carrying
bottles
and
glasses
when
the
flurry
of
had
subsided
they
all
sat
down
let
get
the
business
over
first
gresham
suggested
i
suppose
gone
over
the
collection
already
jeff
yes
and
first
of
all
i
want
to
know
something
when
was
the
last
that
any
of
you
saw
it
gresham
and
pierre
had
been
in
fleming
gunroom
just
two
days
before
the
fatal
accident
and
can
you
tell
me
if
the
big
whitneyville
colt
was
still
there
then
rand
asked
or
the
rappahannock
forge
or
the
collier
flintlock
or
the
hall
why
of
course
my
god
are
they
there
now
gresham
demanded
rand
shook
his
head
and
if
fleming
still
had
them
two
days
before
he
was
killed
then
somebody
been
weeding
out
the
collection
since
doing
it
very
cleverly
too
he
added
you
know
how
that
stuff
arranged
and
how
conspicuous
a
missing
pistol
would
be
well
when
i
was
going
over
the
collection
i
found
about
two
dozen
pieces
of
the
most
utter
trash
things
lane
fleming
would
have
allowed
in
the
house
all
hanging
where
some
really
good
item
ought
to
have
been
he
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
read
off
a
list
of
the
dubious
items
interpolating
comments
on
the
condition
and
a
list
of
the
real
rarities
which
gresham
had
mentioned
the
day
before
which
were
now
missing
all
that
good
stuff
was
there
the
last
time
i
saw
the
collection
gresham
said
what
do
you
say
pierre
i
had
the
hall
pistol
in
my
hands
pierre
said
and
i
remember
looking
at
the
rappahannock
forge
trehearne
broke
in
to
ask
how
many
english
there
were
and
if
the
snaphaunce
highlander
and
the
big
wheel
lock
were
still
there
at
the
same
time
cabot
was
inquiring
about
the
springfield
and
the
virginia
manufactory
pistols
i
have
a
complete
itemized
list
in
a
few
days
rand
said
in
the
meantime
i
like
a
couple
of
you
to
look
at
the
collection
and
help
me
decide
what
missing
i
going
to
try
to
catch
the
thief
and
then
get
at
the
fence
through
him
think
rivers
might
have
gotten
the
pistols
gresham
asked
he
the
crookedest
dealer
i
know
of
he
the
crookedest
dealer
anybody
knows
of
rand
amended
the
only
thing
he
a
little
too
anxious
to
buy
the
collection
for
somebody
who
just
skimmed
off
the
cream
ten
thousand
dollars
is
much
in
the
way
of
anxiety
cabot
said
call
that
a
nominal
bid
to
avoid
suspicion
the
dope
changed
a
little
on
that
rand
brought
him
up
to
date
rivers
offer
is
now
thousand
there
was
a
stunned
hush
followed
by
a
gust
of
exclamations
guid
lorrd
the
scots
accent
fairly
curdled
on
colin
macbride
tongue
we
canna
go
over
that
i
afraid
not
twenty
would
be
about
our
limit
gresham
agreed
and
with
the
best
items
gone
he
shrugged
pierre
and
karen
were
looking
at
each
other
in
blank
misery
their
dream
of
establishing
themselves
in
the
arms
business
had
blown
up
in
their
faces
oh
he
talking
through
his
hat
cabot
declared
he
just
hopes
lose
interest
and
then
he
buy
what
left
of
the
collection
for
a
song
maybe
he
knows
the
collection
been
robbed
trehearne
suggested
that
would
let
him
out
later
he
accuse
you
or
the
fleming
estate
of
holding
out
the
best
pieces
and
then
offer
to
take
what
left
for
about
five
thousand
well
that
would
be
presuming
that
he
knows
the
collection
has
been
robbed
cabot
pointed
out
and
the
only
way
he
know
that
would
be
if
he
himself
had
bought
the
stolen
pistols
well
does
anybody
need
a
chaser
to
swallow
that
trehearne
countered
i
bloody
sure
i
do
karen
lawrence
shook
her
head
no
he
pay
thousand
for
the
collection
just
as
it
stands
to
keep
pierre
and
me
out
of
the
arms
business
this
end
of
the
state
could
support
another
and
with
the
reputation
he
made
for
himself
he
be
the
one
to
go
under
she
stubbed
out
her
cigarette
and
finished
her
drink
if
you
do
mind
pierre
i
think
i
go
home
i
not
feeling
very
festive
myself
right
now
the
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
rand
do
get
the
idea
jeff
that
anybody
here
holds
this
against
you
you
have
your
clients
interests
to
look
out
for
well
if
this
be
treason
make
the
most
of
it
rand
said
but
i
hope
rivers
does
go
through
with
it
i
like
to
see
you
people
get
the
collection
and
i
hate
to
see
a
lot
of
nice
pistols
like
that
get
into
the
hands
of
a
damned
swindler
like
rivers
maybe
i
can
catch
him
with
the
on
him
and
send
him
up
for
about
oh
he
too
smart
for
that
karen
despaired
he
can
get
away
with
faking
but
the
dumbest
jury
in
the
world
would
know
what
receiving
stolen
goods
was
and
he
knows
it
dorothy
and
irene
gresham
accompanied
pierre
and
karen
downstairs
after
they
had
gone
gresham
tried
not
very
successfully
to
inject
more
life
into
the
party
with
another
round
of
drinks
for
a
while
they
discussed
the
personal
and
commercial
iniquities
of
arnold
rivers
trehearne
and
macbride
who
had
come
together
in
the
latter
car
left
shortly
and
half
an
hour
later
philip
cabot
rose
and
announced
that
he
too
was
leaving
you
have
seen
my
collection
since
before
the
war
jeff
he
said
if
you
not
sleepy
why
do
you
stop
at
my
place
and
see
what
new
you
staying
at
the
flemings
my
house
is
along
your
way
about
a
mile
on
the
other
side
of
the
railroad
they
went
out
and
got
into
their
cars
rand
kept
cabot
taillight
in
sight
until
the
broker
swung
into
his
drive
and
put
his
car
in
the
garage
rand
parked
beside
the
road
took
the
leech
rigdon
out
of
the
and
got
out
slipping
the
confederate
revolver
under
his
he
was
pulling
down
his
vest
to
cover
the
butt
as
he
went
up
the
walk
and
joined
his
friend
at
the
front
door
cabot
combination
library
and
gunroom
was
on
the
first
floor
like
rand
own
his
collection
was
hung
on
racks
over
low
bookcases
on
either
side
of
the
room
it
was
strictly
a
collector
collection
intensely
specialized
there
were
all
but
a
few
of
the
regulation
pistols
a
fair
representation
of
secondary
types
most
of
the
revolvers
of
the
civil
war
and
all
the
later
revolvers
and
automatics
in
addition
there
were
british
pistols
of
the
revolution
and
confederate
revolvers
a
couple
of
spanish
revolvers
of
the
lugers
and
mausers
and
steyers
of
the
first
world
war
and
the
pistols
of
all
our
allies
beginning
with
the
french
weapons
of
the
revolution
i
having
the
devil
own
time
filling
in
for
this
last
war
cabot
said
i
have
a
running
in
the
and
i
gotten
a
few
that
nambu
and
that
japanese
and
the
polish
radom
and
the
italian
glisenti
and
that
tokarev
and
of
course
the
and
the
canadian
browning
but
it
going
to
take
the
devil
own
time
i
hope
nobody
starts
another
war
for
a
few
years
till
i
can
get
caught
up
on
the
last
one
rand
was
looking
at
the
confederate
revolvers
griswold
grier
haiman
brothers
tucker
sherrod
dance
brothers
park
spiller
burr
there
it
was
leech
rigdon
he
tapped
it
on
the
cylinder
with
a
finger
was
it
one
of
those
things
that
killed
lane
fleming
he
asked
leech
rigdon
so
i
told
cabot
hesitated
jeff
i
saw
that
revolver
not
four
hours
before
fleming
was
shot
had
it
in
my
hands
looked
it
over
carefully
he
shook
his
head
it
absolutely
was
not
loaded
it
was
empty
and
there
was
rust
in
the
chambers
then
how
the
hell
did
he
get
shot
rand
wanted
to
know
that
i
could
say
i
only
telling
you
how
he
did
get
shot
here
this
is
how
it
was
it
was
a
thursday
and
i
come
halfway
out
from
town
before
i
remembered
that
i
had
bought
a
copy
of
so
i
stopped
at
biddle
drugstore
in
the
village
for
one
just
as
i
was
getting
into
my
car
outside
lane
fleming
drove
up
and
saw
me
he
blew
his
horn
at
me
and
then
waved
to
me
with
this
revolver
in
his
hand
i
went
over
and
looked
at
it
and
he
told
me
he
found
it
hanging
back
of
the
counter
at
a
where
the
road
from
rosemont
joins
route
there
had
been
some
other
pistols
with
it
and
i
went
to
see
them
later
but
they
were
all
trash
the
leech
rigdon
had
been
the
only
decent
thing
there
and
fleming
had
talked
it
out
of
this
fellow
for
ten
dollars
he
was
disgustingly
gleeful
about
it
particularly
as
it
was
a
better
specimen
than
mine
would
you
know
it
if
you
saw
it
again
rand
asked
yes
i
remember
the
serials
i
always
look
at
serials
on
confederate
arms
the
highest
known
serial
number
for
a
leech
rigdon
is
this
one
was
rand
pulled
the
revolver
from
his
and
gave
it
a
quick
glance
the
number
was
he
handed
it
to
cabot
is
this
it
he
asked
cabot
checked
the
number
yes
and
i
remember
this
bruise
on
the
left
grip
fleming
was
saying
that
he
was
glad
it
would
be
on
the
inside
so
it
would
show
when
he
hung
it
on
the
wall
he
carried
the
revolver
to
the
desk
and
held
it
under
the
light
why
this
thing
was
fired
at
all
he
exclaimed
i
thought
that
fleming
might
have
loaded
it
meaning
to
target
it
he
had
a
pistol
range
back
of
his
house
but
the
chambers
are
clean
he
sniffed
at
it
hoppe
number
nine
he
said
and
i
can
see
traces
of
partly
dissolved
rust
and
no
traces
of
fouling
what
the
devil
jeff
it
probably
has
been
fired
since
appomattox
rand
agreed
philip
do
you
think
all
this
routine
might
be
an
elaborate
suicide
either
before
or
after
the
fact
absolutely
not
there
was
a
trace
of
impatience
in
cabot
voice
lane
fleming
was
the
man
to
commit
suicide
i
knew
him
too
well
ever
to
believe
that
i
heard
a
rumor
that
he
was
about
to
lose
control
of
his
company
rand
mentioned
you
know
how
much
premix
meant
to
him
that
idiotic
cabot
voice
was
openly
scornful
now
and
he
seemed
a
little
angry
that
rand
should
believe
such
a
story
as
though
his
confidence
in
his
friend
intelligence
had
been
betrayed
good
lord
jeff
where
did
you
ever
hear
a
yarn
like
that
quote
usually
sources
unquote
well
they
were
unusually
that
time
cabot
replied
take
my
word
for
it
there
absolutely
nothing
in
it
so
it
was
an
accident
and
it
was
suicide
rand
considered
philip
what
is
the
prognosis
on
this
merger
of
premix
and
national
milling
packaging
now
that
lane
fleming
opposition
has
been
shall
we
say
liquidated
cabot
head
jerked
up
he
looked
at
rand
in
shocked
surprise
my
god
you
do
think
he
began
jeff
are
you
investigating
lane
fleming
death
i
was
retained
to
sell
the
collection
rand
stated
now
i
suppose
i
have
to
find
out
who
been
stealing
those
pistols
and
recover
them
and
jail
the
thief
and
the
fence
but
i
was
not
retained
to
investigate
the
death
of
lane
fleming
and
i
do
not
do
work
for
which
i
am
not
paid
he
added
with
mendacious
literalness
i
see
well
the
merger
going
through
it
wo
be
official
until
the
sixteenth
of
may
when
the
premix
stockholders
meet
but
that
just
a
formality
it
all
cut
and
dried
and
in
the
bag
now
better
let
me
pick
you
up
a
little
premix
there
still
some
lying
around
you
make
a
little
less
than
on
it
i
had
that
in
mind
when
i
asked
you
about
the
merger
rand
said
i
have
about
two
thousand
with
you
have
i
he
did
a
moment
mental
arithmetic
then
got
out
his
checkbook
pick
me
up
about
a
hundred
shares
he
told
the
broker
i
been
meaning
to
get
in
on
this
ever
since
i
heard
about
it
i
do
see
how
you
did
hear
about
it
cabot
said
for
obvious
reasons
it
being
kept
pretty
well
under
the
hat
rand
grinned
quote
usually
sources
unquote
not
the
sources
mentioned
above
jeff
you
know
this
damned
thing
worrying
me
cabot
told
him
writing
a
receipt
and
exchanging
it
for
rand
check
i
been
trying
to
ignore
it
but
i
simply
ca
do
you
really
think
lane
fleming
was
murdered
by
somebody
who
wanted
to
see
this
merger
consummated
and
who
knew
that
that
was
an
impossibility
as
long
as
fleming
was
alive
philip
i
do
know
and
furthermore
i
do
give
a
damn
rand
lied
if
somebody
wants
me
to
look
into
it
and
pays
me
my
possibly
exaggerated
idea
of
what
constitutes
fair
compensation
i
will
and
probably
come
up
with
fleming
murderer
dead
or
alive
but
until
then
it
is
simply
no
epidermis
off
my
scrotum
and
i
advise
you
to
adopt
a
similar
attitude
they
changed
the
subject
then
to
the
variety
of
pistols
developed
and
used
by
the
opposing
nations
in
world
war
ii
and
the
difficulties
ahead
of
cabot
in
assembling
even
a
fairly
representative
group
of
them
rand
promised
to
mail
cabot
a
duplicate
copy
of
his
list
of
the
symbols
used
by
the
nazis
to
indicate
the
factories
manufacturing
arms
for
them
as
well
as
copies
of
some
old
wartime
intelligence
dope
on
enemy
at
a
little
past
one
he
left
cabot
home
and
returned
to
the
fleming
residence
there
were
four
cars
in
the
garage
the
packard
sedan
had
not
been
moved
but
the
was
facing
in
the
opposite
direction
the
gray
plymouth
was
in
the
space
from
which
rand
had
driven
earlier
in
the
evening
and
a
black
chrysler
imperial
had
been
run
in
on
the
left
of
the
plymouth
he
put
his
own
car
in
on
the
right
of
the
made
sure
that
the
leech
rigdon
was
locked
in
his
and
closed
and
locked
the
garage
doors
then
he
went
up
into
the
house
through
the
library
and
by
the
spiral
stairway
to
the
gunroom
the
garage
had
been
open
he
recalled
at
the
time
of
lane
death
the
availability
of
such
an
easy
means
of
undetected
ingress
and
egress
threw
the
suspect
field
wide
open
anybody
who
knew
the
habits
of
the
fleming
household
could
have
slipped
up
to
the
gunroom
while
varcek
was
in
his
lab
dunmore
was
in
the
bathroom
and
gladys
and
geraldine
were
in
the
parlor
as
he
crossed
the
hall
to
his
own
room
rand
was
thinking
of
how
narrowly
arnold
rivers
had
escaped
a
disastrous
lawsuit
and
criminal
action
by
the
death
of
lane
fleming
chapter
when
rand
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
found
gladys
nelda
and
a
man
whom
he
decided
by
elimination
must
be
anton
varcek
already
at
the
table
the
latter
rose
as
rand
entered
and
bowed
jerkily
as
gladys
verified
the
guess
with
an
introduction
he
was
about
rand
own
age
and
height
he
had
a
face
adorned
with
bushy
eyebrows
each
of
which
was
almost
as
heavy
as
rand
mustache
it
was
a
face
that
seemed
tantalizingly
familiar
and
rand
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
nodded
mentally
of
course
he
had
seen
a
face
like
that
hundreds
of
times
in
newsreels
and
and
once
in
berlin
its
living
double
rudolf
hess
he
wondered
how
much
deeper
the
resemblance
went
and
tried
not
to
let
it
prejudice
him
nelda
greeted
him
with
a
trowelful
of
sweetness
and
a
dash
of
gladys
waved
him
to
a
vacant
seat
at
her
right
and
summoned
the
maid
who
had
been
serving
breakfast
after
rand
had
indicated
his
preference
of
fruit
and
found
out
what
else
there
was
to
eat
he
inquired
where
the
others
were
oh
fred
still
dressing
he
be
down
in
a
minute
nelda
told
him
and
geraldine
wo
she
never
eats
with
her
breakfast
varcek
winced
slightly
at
this
and
shifted
the
subject
by
inquiring
if
rand
were
a
professional
no
i
a
amateur
rand
told
him
or
was
until
i
took
this
job
i
have
a
collection
of
my
own
and
i
supposed
to
be
something
of
an
authority
my
business
is
operating
a
private
detective
agency
but
you
are
here
only
as
an
varcek
inquired
you
are
not
making
any
sort
of
detective
investigation
that
right
rand
assured
him
this
is
practically
a
paid
vacation
for
me
first
time
i
ever
handled
anything
like
this
it
a
real
pleasure
to
be
working
at
something
i
really
enjoy
for
a
change
varcek
nodded
yes
i
can
understand
that
my
own
work
for
instance
i
would
continue
with
my
research
even
if
i
were
independently
wealthy
and
any
sort
of
work
were
unnecessary
tell
colonel
rand
what
you
working
on
now
nelda
urged
varcek
gave
a
small
mirthless
laugh
oh
colonel
rand
would
be
no
more
interested
than
i
would
be
in
his
pistols
he
objected
then
turned
to
rand
it
is
a
series
of
experiments
having
to
do
with
the
chemical
nature
of
life
he
said
another
perfunctory
chuckle
no
i
am
not
trying
to
frankenstein
monster
the
fact
is
i
am
working
with
fruit
flies
something
about
heredity
rand
wanted
to
know
varcek
laughed
again
with
more
amusement
so
one
says
flies
and
immediately
another
thinks
it
is
practically
a
standard
response
only
in
this
case
i
am
investigating
the
effect
of
diet
changes
i
use
fruit
flies
because
of
their
extreme
adaptability
if
i
find
that
i
am
on
the
right
track
i
shall
work
with
mice
next
fred
dunmore
mentioned
a
packaged
diabetic
ration
you
developed
rand
mentioned
oh
yes
varcek
shrugged
yes
something
like
an
army
for
diabetics
to
carry
when
traveling
or
wherever
proper
food
may
be
unobtainable
that
is
for
the
company
soon
we
put
it
on
the
market
and
make
lots
of
money
but
this
other
that
is
my
own
private
work
dunmore
had
come
in
while
varcek
was
speaking
and
had
seated
himself
beside
his
wife
do
let
him
kid
you
colonel
he
said
anton
just
as
keen
about
that
dollar
as
the
rest
of
us
i
do
know
what
he
cooking
up
up
there
in
the
attic
but
i
give
we
be
selling
it
in
packages
inside
a
year
and
selling
plenty
of
them
oh
and
speaking
about
that
dollar
how
did
you
make
out
with
gresham
and
his
friends
i
did
they
expected
to
pay
about
twenty
thousand
for
the
collection
rivers
offer
has
them
stopped
and
even
if
they
could
go
over
i
think
rivers
would
raise
them
he
afraid
to
let
them
get
the
collection
pierre
jarrett
and
karen
lawrence
intended
using
their
share
of
it
to
go
into
the
business
in
competition
with
him
that
smart
dunmore
approved
it
always
better
to
take
a
small
loss
stopping
competition
than
to
let
it
get
too
big
for
you
you
save
a
bigger
loss
later
how
soon
do
you
think
the
pistols
will
be
sold
gladys
asked
oh
in
about
a
month
at
the
outside
rand
said
continuing
to
explain
what
had
to
be
done
first
well
i
glad
of
that
varcek
commented
i
never
liked
those
things
and
after
what
happened
the
sooner
they
can
be
sold
the
better
breakfast
finally
ended
and
varcek
and
dunmore
left
for
the
premix
plant
rand
debated
for
a
moment
the
wisdom
of
speaking
to
gladys
about
the
missing
pistols
then
decided
to
wait
until
his
suspicions
were
better
verified
after
a
few
minutes
in
the
gunroom
going
over
lane
fleming
on
the
shelf
over
the
workbench
without
finding
any
trace
of
the
book
in
which
he
had
catalogued
his
collection
he
got
his
hat
and
coat
went
down
to
the
garage
and
took
out
his
car
it
had
stopped
raining
for
the
time
being
the
dingy
sky
showed
broken
spots
like
bits
of
bluing
on
a
piece
of
steel
as
he
got
out
of
his
car
in
front
of
arnold
rivers
house
he
was
wondering
just
how
he
was
going
to
go
about
what
he
wanted
to
do
after
all
the
door
of
the
shop
was
unlocked
and
opened
with
a
slow
clanging
of
the
but
the
interior
was
dark
all
the
shades
had
been
pulled
and
the
lights
were
out
for
a
moment
rand
stood
in
the
doorway
adjusting
his
eyes
to
the
darkness
within
and
wondering
where
everybody
was
then
in
the
path
of
light
that
fell
inward
from
the
open
door
he
saw
two
feet
in
tan
shoes
toes
up
at
the
end
of
legs
on
the
floor
an
instant
later
he
stepped
inside
pulled
the
door
shut
after
him
and
was
using
his
to
find
the
electric
switch
for
a
second
or
so
after
he
snapped
it
nothing
happened
and
then
the
darkness
was
broken
by
the
flickering
of
fluorescent
tubes
when
they
finally
lit
he
saw
the
shape
on
the
floor
arms
outflung
the
inverted
rifle
above
it
for
a
seemingly
long
time
he
stood
and
stared
at
the
grotesquely
transfixed
body
of
arnold
rivers
the
dead
man
lay
on
his
back
not
three
feet
beyond
the
radius
of
the
door
in
a
pool
of
blood
that
was
almost
dried
and
gave
the
room
a
butchershop
odor
under
the
back
of
rand
hand
cheek
was
cold
his
muscles
had
already
begun
to
stiffen
in
rand
examined
the
dead
man
wounds
his
coat
was
stained
with
blood
and
gashed
in
several
places
driven
into
his
chest
by
a
downward
blow
the
bayonet
of
a
short
german
service
mauser
pinned
him
to
the
floor
like
a
specimen
on
a
naturalist
card
beside
the
one
in
which
the
weapon
remained
there
were
three
in
the
chest
and
the
lower
part
of
the
face
was
disfigured
by
what
looked
like
a
bending
over
rand
could
see
the
imprint
of
the
mauser
on
rivers
jaw
on
the
itself
were
traces
of
blood
the
rifle
a
regulation
german
infantry
weapon
the
in
its
most
recent
modification
was
a
nazi
product
bearing
the
eagle
and
encircled
swastika
of
the
third
reich
and
the
the
symbol
of
the
mauserwerke
plant
at
karlsruhe
it
had
doubtless
been
sold
to
rivers
by
some
returned
soldier
in
a
rack
beside
the
door
were
a
number
of
other
military
rifles
a
krag
a
couple
of
arisakas
a
long
german
infantry
rifle
of
the
first
world
war
a
greek
mannlicher
a
mexican
mauser
a
british
short
model
all
had
fixed
bayonets
between
the
and
one
of
the
arisakas
there
was
a
vacancy
rivers
carved
ivory
was
lying
beside
the
body
crushed
at
the
end
as
though
it
had
been
stepped
on
a
cigarette
had
been
in
it
it
too
was
crushed
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
great
struggle
however
the
attack
which
had
ended
the
life
must
have
come
as
a
complete
surprise
he
had
probably
been
holding
the
in
his
hand
when
the
had
been
delivered
and
had
dropped
it
and
flung
up
his
arms
instinctively
thereupon
his
assailant
had
reversed
his
weapon
and
driven
the
bayonet
into
his
chest
the
first
blow
no
doubt
had
been
fatal
it
could
have
been
any
of
the
three
stabs
in
the
chest
but
the
killer
had
given
him
two
more
probably
while
he
was
on
the
floor
then
grasping
the
rifle
in
both
hands
he
had
stood
over
his
victim
and
pinned
the
body
to
the
floor
that
last
blow
could
have
only
been
inspired
by
pure
anger
and
hatred
yet
apparently
rivers
had
been
unaware
of
his
visitor
murderous
intentions
even
while
the
rifle
was
being
taken
from
the
rack
rand
strolled
back
through
the
shop
looking
about
someone
had
been
here
with
rivers
for
some
time
the
dealer
and
another
man
had
sat
by
the
fire
drinking
and
smoking
on
the
low
table
was
a
fifth
of
haig
haig
a
siphon
two
glasses
a
glass
bowl
containing
water
that
had
evidently
melted
from
and
an
ashtray
in
the
ashtray
were
a
number
of
river
cigarette
butts
all
and
a
quantity
of
ash
some
of
it
there
was
no
and
no
band
or
cellophane
wrapper
the
fire
on
the
hearth
had
burned
out
and
the
ashes
were
cold
they
were
not
all
a
considerable
amount
of
paper
no
cardboard
had
been
burned
there
also
poking
gently
with
the
point
of
a
sword
he
took
from
a
rack
rand
discovered
that
what
had
been
burned
had
been
a
number
of
cards
about
six
inches
by
four
one
of
which
had
somehow
managed
to
escape
the
flames
with
nothing
more
than
a
charred
edge
improvising
tweezers
from

picked

laid

on

along
with
the
drinking
equipment
at
least
he
knew
what
had
gone
into
the
fire
arnold
purchase
and
sales
record
he
doubted
very
strongly
if
that
would
have
been
burned
while
its
owner
was
still
alive
going
over
to
the
desk
he
checked
the
drawer
from
which
he
had
seen
cecil
gillis
get
the
card
for
the
leech
rigdon
had
been
cleaned
out
picking
up
the
phone
in
an
awkward
unnatural
manner
he
used
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
to
dial
a
number
with
which
he
was
familiar
a
number
that
meant
the
same
thing
on
any
telephone
exchange
in
the

police
corporal
kavaalen
a
voice
singsonged
out
of
the
receiver
my
name
is
rand
he
identified
himself
i
am
calling
from
arnold
rivers
shop
on
route
about
a
mile
and
a
half
east
of
rosemont
i
am
reporting
a
homicide
yeah
go
ahead
hey
did
you
say
homicide
the
other
voice
asked
sharply
who
rivers
himself
i
called
at
his
shop
a
few
minutes
ago
found
the
front
door
open
and
walked
in
i
found
rivers
lying
dead
on
the
floor
just
inside
the
door
he
had
been
killed
with
a
mauser
rifle
not
shot
clubbed
with
the
butt
and
bayoneted
the
body
is
cold
beginning
to
stiffen
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
is
almost
completely
dried
that
a
good
report
mister
the
corporal
approved
you
stick
around
we
be
right
along
you
have
touched
anything
have
you
not
around
the
body
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
get
here
about
ten
minutes
i
tell
sergeant
mckenna
right
away
rand
hung
up
and
glanced
at
his
watch
ten
he
gave
himself
seven
minutes
and
went
around
the
room
rapidly
looking
only
at
pistols
he
saw
nothing
that
might
have
come
from
the
fleming
collection
finally
he
opened
the
front
door
just
as
a
white
state
police
car
was
pulling
up
at
the
end
of
the
walk
sergeant
ignatius
loyola
mckenna
customarily
known
and
addressed
as
mick
piled
out
almost
before
it
had
stopped
the
driver
a
stocky
finn
with
a
corporal
chevrons
followed
him
and
two
privates
got
out
from
behind
dragging
after
them
a
box
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
army
footlocker
mckenna
was
halfway
up
the
drive
before
he
recognized
rand
then
he
stopped
short
well
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
corporal
my
god
aarvo
you
said
his
name
was
grant
that
what
i
thought
he
said
rand
recognized
the
singsong
accent
he
had
heard
on
the
phone
you
know
him
know
him
mckenna
stepped
aside
quickly
to
avoid
being
overrun
by
the
two
privates
with
the
he
sighed
resignedly
aarvo
this
is
the
notorious
jefferson
davis
rand
agency
in
new
belfast
he
gestured
toward
the
finn
corporal
aarvo
kavaalen
he
introduced
and
privates
skinner
and
jameson
well
where
is
it
right
inside
rand
stepped
backward
gesturing
them
in
careful
just
inside
the
doorway
mckenna
and
the
corporal
entered
the
two
privates
set
down
their
box
outside
and
followed
they
all
drew
up
in
a
semicircle
around
the
late
arnold
rivers
and
looked
at
him
critically
jesus
kavaalen
pronounced
the
as
though
it
were
he
gave
all
his
syllables
an
intonation
say
somebody
gave
him
a
good
job
somebody
been
seeing
too
many
mckenna
got
a
cigarette
out
of
his
tunic
pocket
and
lit
it
in
rand
want
to
confess
now
or
do
you
insist
on
a
third
degree
with
all
the
trimmings
kavaalen
looked
at
rand
then
at
mckenna
and
then
back
at
rand
rand
laughed
now
mick
he
reproved
you
know
i
never
kill
anybody
unless
i
have
a
clear
case
of
and
a
flock
of
witnesses
to
back
it
up
mckenna
nodded
and
reassured
his
corporal
that
right
aarvo
when
jeff
rand
kills
anybody
it
always
and
he
generally
make
messes
like
this
he
gave
the
body
a
brief
scrutiny
then
turned
to
rand
you
looked
around
of
course
what
do
you
make
of
it
last
night
sometime
rand
reconstructed
rivers
had
a
visitor
a
man
who
smoked
cigars
he
and
rivers
were
on
friendly
or
at
least
sociable
terms
they
sat
back
there
by
the
fire
for
some
time
smoking
and
drinking
the
shades
were
all
drawn
i
do
know
whether
that
was
standard
procedure
or
because
this
conference
was
something
clandestine
finally
rivers
visitor
got
up
to
leave
now
of
course
he
could
have
left
and
somebody
else
could
have
come
here
later
been
admitted
and
killed
rivers
that
a
possibility
rand
said
but
it
also
an
assumption
without
anything
to
support
it
i
rather
like
the
idea
that
the
man
who
sat
back
there
drinking
and
smoking
with
rivers
was
the
killer
if
so
rivers
must
have
gone
with
him
to
the
door
and
was
about
to
open
it
when
this
fellow
picked
up
that
rifle
probably
from
that
rack
over
there
and
clipped
him
on
the
jaw
with
the
butt
then
he
gave
him
the
point
three
times
the
second
and
third
probably
while
rivers
was
down
then
he
swung
it
up
and
slammed
down
with
it
and
left
it
sticking
through
rivers
and
in
the
floor
mckenna
nodded
lights
on
when
you
got
here
he
asked
no
i
put
them
on
when
i
came
in
the
killer
must
have
turned
them
off
when
he
left
but
the
deadlatch
on
the
door
was
set
and
he
seem
to
have
bothered
checking
on
that
think
he
left
right
after
he
killed
rivers
rand
shook
his
head
no
that
was
just
the
first
part
of
it
after
finished
rivers
he
went
back
to
that
desk
and
got
all
the
cards
rivers
used
to
record
his
transactions
on
an
individual
card
for
every
item
he
destroyed
the
lot
of
them
or
at
least
most
of
them
in
the
fireplace
now
i
only
guessing
here
but
i
think
he
took
out
a
card
or
cards
in
which
he
had
some
interest
and
then
dumped
the
rest
in
the
fire
to
prevent
anybody
from
being
able
to
determine
which
ones
he
was
interested
in
i
am
further
guessing
that
the
cards
which
the
killer
wanted
to
suppress
were
in
the
file
but
i
am
not
guessing
about
the
destruction
of
the
i
found
the
fireplace
full
of
ashes
found
one
card
that
had
escaped
unburned
you
can
be
sure
that
one
was
important
and
found
the
drawer
where
the
was
kept
empty
think
he
might
have
stolen
something
and
covered
up
by
burning
the
cards
mckenna
asked
rand
shook
his
head
again
i
was
here
yesterday
bought
a
pistol
from
rivers
that
how
i
noticed
this
system
of
course
i
look
at
everything
while
i
was
here
but
i
ca
see
where
any
quantity
of
arms
have
been
removed
and
rivers
did
have
any
single
item
that
was
worth
a
murder
fact
is
no
old
firearm
is
there
are
only
a
very
few
old
arms
that
are
worth
over
a
thousand
dollars
and
most
of
them
are
unique
specimens
that
would
be
unsaleable
because
every
collector
would
know
where
it
came
from
we
can
check
possible
thefts
with
rivers
clerk
when
he
gets
here
mckenna
said
now
suppose
you
show
me
these
things
you
found
back
at
the
rear
aarvo
you
and
the
boys
start
taking
pictures
he
told
the
corporal
then
he
followed
rand
back
through
the
shop
he
tested
the
temperature
of
the
water
in
the
with
his
finger
he
looked
at
the
ashtray
and
bent
over
and
sniffed
at
each
of
the
two
glasses
i
see
one
of
them
been
emptied
out
he
commented
want
to
bet
it
has
been
wiped
clean
too
rand
smiled
slightly
even
the
tiny
tots
wipe
off
the
after
they
raided
it
he
said
a
lit
the
front
of
the
shop
briefly
corporal
kavaalen
said
something
to
the
others
mckenna
picked
up
the
card
rand
had
found
by
the
edges
and
looked
at
it
what
in
hell
this
all
about
jeff
he
asked
rivers
made
it
out
for
one
of
his
pistols
an
english
flintlock
i
can
show
you
one
almost
like
it
up
front
he
gotten
it
and
three
others
back
in
in
trade
for
a
kentucky
rifle
the
numbers
are
the
letters
are
rivers
private
those
three
at
the
end
are
respectively
what
he
absolutely
had
to
get
for
it
what
he
thought
was
a
reasonable
price
and
the
most
he
thought
the
traffic
would
stand
he
sold
it
in
for
his
middle
price
there
was
another
flash
by
the
door
then
kavaalen
called
out
hey
mick
we
got
two
of
the
stiffs
now
all
right
if
we
pull
out
the
bayonet
for
a
of
his
chest
sure
better
chalkline
it
first
you
move
things
jerking
that
bayonet
out
he
turned
back
to
rand
you
think
then
that
maybe
some
card
in
that
file
would
have
gotten
somebody
in
trouble
and
he
had
to
croak
rivers
to
get
it
and
then
burned
the
rest
of
the
cards
for
a
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
rand
agreed
just
because
i
ca
think
of
any
other
possibility
though
does
mean
that
there
are
any
others
hey
you
think
he
might
have
been
selling
modern
arms
to
criminals
without
reporting
the
sale
mckenna
asked
i
would
put
it
past
him
rand
considered
there
was
very
little
that
i
would
put
past
that
fellow
but
i
would
think
he
be
stupid
enough
to
carry
a
record
of
such
sales
in
his
own
file
though
mckenna
rubbed
the
butt
of
his
reflectively
that
seemed
to
be
his
substitute
for
as
an
aid
to
cerebration
you
said
you
were
here
yesterday
and
bought
a
pistol
he
began
all
right
i
know
about
that
collection
of
yours
but
why
were
you
back
here
bright
and
early
this
morning
you
working
on
rivers
for
somebody
if
so
give
rand
told
him
what
he
was
working
on
rivers
wants
to
buy
the
fleming
collection
that
was
the
reason
i
saw
him
yesterday
but
the
reason
i
came
here
this
morning
is
that
i
find
that
somebody
has
stolen
about
two
dozen
of
the
best
pistols
out
of
the
collection
since
death
and
tried
to
cover
up
by
replacing
them
with
some
junk
that
lane
fleming
would
have
allowed
inside
his
house
for
my
money
it
the
butler
now
that
fleming
dead
he
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
knows
enough
about
arms
to
know
what
was
worth
stealing
he
has
constant
access
to
the
gunroom
i
caught
him
in
a
lie
about
a
book
fleming
kept
a
record
of
his
collection
in
and
now
the
book
has
vanished
and
furthermore
and
most
important
if
he
been
on
the
level
he
would
have
spotted
what
was
going
on
long
ago
and
squawked
about
it
that
a
damn
good
circumstantial
case
jeff
mckenna
nodded
nothing
you
could
take
to
a
jury
of
course
but
mighty
good
grounds
for
suspicion
you
think
rivers
could
have
been
the
fence
he
could
have
been
whoever
was
higrading
the
collection
had
to
have
an
outlet
for
his
stuff
and
he
had
to
have
a
source
of
supply
for
the
junk
he
was
infiltrating
into
the
collection
as
replacements
a
crooked
dealer
is
the
answer
to
both
and
arnold
rivers
was
definitely
crooked
you
know
that
mckenna
inquired
for
sure
another
flash
lit
the
front
of
the
shop
rand
nodded
for
damn
good
and
sure
i
can
show
you
half
a
dozen
firearms
in
this
shop
that
have
been
altered
to
increase
their
value
i
do
mean
legitimate
restorations
i
mean
fraudulent
alterations
he
went
on
to
tell
mckenna
about
rivers
expulsion
from
membership
in
the
national
rifle
association
and
i
know
that
he
sold
a
pair
of
pistols
to
lane
fleming
about
a
week
before
fleming
was
killed
that
were
outright
fakes
fleming
was
going
to
sue
the
ears
off
rivers
about
that
the
fact
is
until
this
morning
i
been
wondering
if
that
might
have
been
why
fleming
had
that
accident
if
he
lived
he
have
run
rivers
out
of
business
hell
i
did
know
that
mckenna
seemed
worried
fleming
used
to
with
our
gang
and
he
knew
too
much
about
gats
to
pull
a
russ
columbo
on
himself
i
did
like
that
accident
at
the
time
but
i
figured
he
pulled
the
dutch
and
the
family
were
making
out
it
was
an
accident
we
never
were
called
in
the
whole
thing
was
handled
through
the
coroner
office
you
really
think
fleming
could
have
been
bumped
yes
i
think
he
could
have
been
bumped
rand
understated
i
found
any
positive
proof
but
he
told
mckenna
about
his
purchase
from
rivers
of
the
revolver
that
had
been
later
identified
as
the
one
brought
home
by
fleming
on
the
day
of
his
death
i
still
do
know
how
rivers
got
hold
of
it
he
continued
until
i
walked
in
here
not
half
an
hour
ago
and
found
rivers
dead
on
the
floor
i
had
a
suspicion
that
rivers
might
have
sneaked
into
the
fleming
house
shot
fleming
with
another
revolver
left
it
in
fleming
hand
and
carried
away
the
one
fleming
had
been
working
on
the
motive
of
course
would
have
been
to
stop
a
lawsuit
that
would
have
put
rivers
out
of
business
and
not
inconceivably
in
jail
but
now
he
looked
toward
the
front
of
the
shop
where
another
glared
for
an
instant
and
do
suggest
that
rivers
got
and
killed
himself
aside
from
the
technical
difficulties
of
pinning
himself
to
the
floor
after
he
was
dead
that
explanation
out
rivers
had
no
conscience
to
be
stricken
with
well
let
skip
fleming
for
a
minute
mckenna
suggested
you
think
this
butler
at
the
fleming
place
was
robbing
the
collection
and
you
say
he
could
sold
the
stuff
he
stole
to
rivers
well
when
the
family
gets
you
in
to
work
on
the
collection
jeeves
or
whatever
his
name
is
realizes
that
you
going
to
spot
what
been
going
on
and
will
probably
suspect
him
he
knows
you
no
ordinary
you
an
agency
dick
so
he
gets
scared
if
you
catch
up
with
rivers
talk
so
he
comes
over
here
last
night
and
kills
rivers
off
before
you
can
get
to
him
and
while
rivers
may
not
keep
a
record
of
the
stuff
he
got
from
jeeves
or
whatever
his
name
is
walters
rand
supplied
walters
then
while
he
may
not
keep
a
record
of
what
he
bought
from
walters
the
chances
are
he
does
keep
a
record
of
the
stuff
walters
got
from
him
to
use
for
replacements
so
the
goes
into
the
fire
how
that
the
flare
of
another
made
distorted
shadows
dance
over
the
walls
that
would
hang
together
now
rand
agreed
of
course
i
have
found
anything
here
except
the
revolver
i
bought
yesterday
that
came
from
the
fleming
place
but
i
add
this
as
soon
as
rivers
found
out
i
was
working
for
the
fleming
family
he
tried
to
get
that
revolver
back
from
me
offered
me
dollars
worth
of
credit
on
anything
else
in
the
shop
if
i
give
it
back
to
him
not
twenty
minutes
after
i
paid
him
sixty
for
it
see
mckenna
pounced
look
suppose
you
had
a
lot
of
hot
stuff
in
a
place
like
this
you
might
take
a
chance
on
selling
something
that
had
gotten
mixed
in
with
your
legitimate
stuff
but
would
you
want
to
sell
it
right
back
to
where
it
had
been
stolen
from
no
i
would
and
if
i
were
a
butler
who
been
robbing
a
valuable
collection
and
an
agency
man
moved
in
and
started
poking
around
i
might
get
in
a
panic
and
do
something
extreme
that
all
hangs
together
too
while
rand
was
talking
to
mckenna
private
jameson
wandered
back
through
the
shop
hey
sarge
is
there
any
way
into
the
house
from
here
he
asked
the
outside
doors
are
all
locked
and
i
ca
raise
anybody
rand
pointed
out
the
flight
of
steps
beside
the
fireplace
i
saw
rivers
come
out
of
the
house
that
way
yesterday
he
said
the
state
policeman
went
up
the
steps
and
tried
the
door
it
opened
and
he
went
through
chances
are
rivers
is
away
mckenna
said
she
away
a
lot
they
have
a
colored
girl
who
comes
in
by
the
day
but
she
does
generally
get
here
before
noon
and
the
clerk
does
get
here
till
about
the
same
time
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
this
household
rand
said
yeah
we
have
this
place
marked
up
as
a
bad
and
hazard
we
keep
an
eye
on
it
rivers
has
all
these
guns
he
does
a
big
cash
business
he
always
has
a
couple
of
hundred
to
a
thousand
on
him
it
a
wonder
somebody
has
made
a
try
at
this
place
long
ago
tell
you
what
jeff
say
you
check
up
on
this
butler
at
the
fleming
place
for
us
and
we
check
up
here
and
see
if
we
can
find
any
of
the
stuff
that
was
stolen
we
can
get
together
and
compare
notes
maybe
one
or
another
of
us
may
run
across
something
about
that
accident
of
fleming
too
suits
me
i
be
glad
to
help
you
and
i
be
glad
for
any
help
you
can
give
me
on
recovering
those
pistols
i
have
made
any
formal
report
on
that
yet
because
i
not
sure
exactly
what
missing
and
i
want
any
of
that
kind
of
publicity
while
i
trying
to
sell
the
collection
it
may
be
that
the
two
matters
are
related
there
are
some
points
of
similarity
which
may
or
may
not
mean
anything
and
of
course
i
just
may
find
somebody
who
make
it
worth
my
time
to
get
interested
in
this
killing
while
i
at
it
mckenna
chuckled
that
must
hurt
hell
out
of
you
jeff
he
said
a
nice
classy
murder
like
this
and
nobody
to
pay
you
to
work
on
it
it
does
rand
admitted
i
feel
like
an
undertaker
watching
a
man
being
swallowed
by
a
shark
you
want
to
stick
around
till
this
clerk
of
rivers
gets
here
mckenna
asked
he
should
be
here
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
no
i
just
as
soon
not
be
seen
taking
too
much
of
an
interest
in
this
right
now
fact
is
i
just
as
soon
not
have
my
name
mentioned
at
all
in
connection
with
this
you
can
charge
the
discovery
of
the
body
up
to
our
old
friend
anonymous
tip
ca
you
sure
mckenna
accompanied
rand
to
the
front
door
past
the
white
chalked
outline
that
marked
the
original
position
of
the
body
the
body
itself
with
fingertips
lay
to
one
side
out
of
the
way
corporal
kavaalen
was
going
through
the
dead
man
pockets
and
skinner
was
working
on
the
rifle
with
an
insufflator
well
we
ca
say
it
was
robbery
anyhow
kavaalen
said
he
had
eight
c
in
his
billfold
migawd
sarge
is
this
damn
rifle
ever
lousy
with
prints
skinner
complained
a
lot
of
rivers
and
everybody
else
who
been
fooling
with
it
around
here
and
half
the
swell
swell
mckenna
enthused
maybe
we
can
pass
the
case
off
on
the
war
crimes
commission
chapter
mick
mckenna
had
put
his
finger
right
on
the
sore
spot
it
did
hurt
rand
like
hell
a
nice
sensational
murder
and
no
money
in
it
for
the
agency
obviously
somebody
would
have
to
be
persuaded
to
finance
an
investigation
preferably
some
innocent
victim
of
unjust
suspicion
somebody
who
could
best
clear
himself
by
unmasking
the
real
villain
for
villain
rand
mentally
substituted
public
benefactor
he
was
running
over
a
list
of
possible
suspects
as
he
entered
rosemont
passing
the
little
antique
shop
he
slowed
backed
read
the
name
karen
lawrence
on
the
window
and
then
pulled
over
to
the
curb
and
got
out
crossing
the
sidewalk
he
went
up
the
steps
to
the
door
entering
to
the
jangling
of
a
cowbell
the
girl
dealer
was
inside
with
a
visitor
a
man
of
indeterminate
age
who
was
opening
packages
on
a
karen
greeted
rand
by
name
and
military
rank
rand
told
her
he
just
look
around
till
she
was
through
she
tossed
him
a
look
of
comic
reproach
as
though
she
had
counted
on
him
to
rid
her
of
the
man
with
the
packages
now
just
you
look
at
miss
lawrence
the
man
was
enthusing
undoing
another
package
here
something
i
know
you
want
i
think
is
real
quaint
just
look
now
he
displayed
some
long
narrow
dark
object
holding
it
out
to
her
ai
an
interestin
item
now
miss
lawrence
what
in
heaven
name
is
that
thing
she
demanded
a
sword
a
real
african
native
sword
look
at
that
scabbard
now
made
out
of
real
a
whole
young
crocodile
head
feet
an
all
i
tell
you
miss
lawrence
item
is
unique
it
revolting
it
the
most
repulsive
object
that
ever
been
brought
into
this
shop
which
is
saying
quite
a
lot
colonel
rand
if
you
have
a
hangover
this
morning
will
you
please
come
here
and
look
at
this
thing
rand
laid
down
the
merril
carbine
he
had
been
examining
and
walked
over
beside
karen
the
man
whom
rand
judged
to
be
some
rural
extended
the
object
of
the
girl
repugnance
it
was
an
african
sword
all
right
with
a
plain
iron
hilt
and
the
design
looked
berber
but
the
workmanship
was
and
probably
attributable
to
some
even
more
barbarous
people
the
scabbard
was
what
was
really
surprising
if
you
liked
that
kind
of
surprises
it
was
an
infant
crocodile
rather
indifferently
the
sword
simply
went
in
between
the
creature
jaws
and
extended
the
length
of
the
body
and
into
the
tail
either
end
of
a
leather
thong
had
been
fastened
to
the
two
front
paws
for
a
when
new
rand
thought
it
must
have
given
its
wearer
a
really
distinctive
aroma
even
for
africa
he
drew
the
blade
gingerly
looked
at
it
and
sheathed
it
with
caution
east
african
danakil
or
somali
or
something
like
that
he
commented
be
damn
good
and
careful
not
to
scratch
yourself
on
that
if
you
do
you
need
about
a
gallon
of
shots
it
might
be
poisoned
the
man
with
the
dirty
neck
and
the
haircut
inquired
eagerly
see
miss
lawrence
what
i
told
you
a
real
african
native
sword
i
got
from
hen
sourbaw
over
at
feltonville
his
uncle
the
reverend
sourbaw
that
used
to
preach
at
hemlock
gap
church
brung
it
from
africa
himself
about
fifty
years
ago
he
used
to
be
a
missionary
in
his
younger
days
i
can
make
you
an
awful
good
price
on
item
miss
lawrence
god
forbid
she
exclaimed
all
my
customers
are
heavy
drinkers
i
would
want
to
answer
for
what
might
happen
if
some
of
them
saw
that
thing
suddenly
oh
well
how
about
little
amethyst
bottle
then
well
i
would
give
you
seven
dollars
for
that
she
grudged
well
it
yours
then
an
how
about
an
rand
wandered
back
to
examining
firearms
eventually
after
buying
the
karen
got
rid
of
the
man
with
the
antiques
when
he
had
gone
she
found
a
pack
of
cigarettes
offered
it
to
rand
and
lit
one
for
herself
well
now
you
see
why
girls
leave
home
and
start
antique
shops
she
said
never
a
dull
moment
was
that
sword
the
awfullest
thing
you
ever
saw
though
well
one
of
the
ten
awfullest
rand
conceded
i
just
stopped
in
to
give
you
some
good
news
you
wo
need
to
consider
that
offer
of
arnold
rivers
any
more
he
is
no
longer
interested
in
the
fleming
collection
he
is
an
eager
happy
light
danced
up
in
her
eyes
you
saw
him
again
this
morning
what
did
he
say
he
did
say
anything
he
is
talking
any
more
either
fact
is
he
is
even
breathing
any
more
he
you
mean
he
dead
she
was
surprised
even
shocked
the
shock
was
probably
a
concession
to
good
taste
but
the
surprise
looked
genuine
when
did
he
die
it
must
have
been
very
sudden
i
saw
him
a
few
days
ago
and
he
looked
all
right
of
course
he
been
having
trouble
with
his
lungs
but
it
was
very
sudden
some
time
last
night
some
person
or
persons
unknown
gave
him
a
job
with
a
german
mauser
out
of
a
rack
in
his
shop
a
most
unpleasantly
thorough
job
i
went
to
see
him
this
morning
hoping
to
badger
something
out
of
him
about
those
pistols
that
are
missing
from
the
fleming
collection
and
found
the
body
i
notified
the
state
police
and
just
came
from
there
for
god
sake
the
shock
was
genuine
too
now
have
the
police
any
idea
not
the
foggiest
if
some
of
the
fleming
pistols
turn
up
at
his
place
i
might
think
that
had
something
to
do
with
it
so
far
though
they
have
i
gave
the
shop
a
before
the
cops
arrived
and
could
find
anything
she
tried
to
take
a
puff
from
her
cigarette
and
found
that
she
had
broken
it
in
her
fingers
she
lit
a
new
one
from
the
mangled
butt
when
did
it
happen
she
tried
to
make
the
question
sound
casual
that
i
could
say
either
around
midnight
would
be
my
guess
they
might
be
able
to
fix
a
time
an
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
smiled
but
that
dreadful
she
really
meant
that
it
a
terrible
thing
to
happen
to
anybody
being
killed
like
that
she
stopped
just
short
of
adding
even
rivers
instead
she
continued
but
i
ca
say
really
very
sorry
he
dead
colonel
outside
of
maybe
his
wife
and
the
gunsmith
who
made
his
fake
walker
colts
and
north
cheney
flintlocks
who
is
he
countered
oh
yes
cecil
gillis
he
about
due
for
induction
into
the
army
of
the
unemployed
unless
rivers
intends
carrying
on
the
business
karen
eyes
widened
cecil
gillis
she
exclaimed
softly
i
wonder
now
if
he
has
an
alibi
for
last
night
think
he
might
need
one
rand
asked
of
course
i
only
saw
him
once
but
he
did
strike
me
as
a
possible
candidate
i
ca
seem
to
see
young
gillis
doing
a
messy
job
like
this
was
or
going
to
all
that
manual
labor
when
he
could
have
used
something
neat
like
a
pistol
or
a
dagger
well
cecil
is
quite
the
languishing
flower
he
looks
karen
told
him
he
does
a
lot
of
swimming
and
he
one
of
the
few
people
around
here
who
can
beat
me
at
tennis
and
he
has
a
motive
maybe
two
motives
such
as
rand
prompted
maybe
you
think
cecil
is
a
you
know
one
of
those
boys
she
euphemized
well
he
is
he
takes
a
perfectly
normal
and
even
slightly
wolfish
interest
in
the
female
of
his
species
and
while
arnold
rivers
may
have
been
a
good
provider
from
a
financial
standpoint
he
was
quite
up
to
his
wife
requirements
in
another
important
respect
and
rivers
was
away
a
lot
on
buying
trips
and
so
on
and
when
he
was
nobody
ever
saw
cecil
leave
the
rivers
place
in
the
evenings
at
least
that
the
story
personally
i
would
know
of
course
where
smoke
there
may
be
nothing
more
than
somebody
with
a
stogie
but
then
there
may
be
a
regular
conflagration
that
would
be
a
perfectly
satisfactory
motive
under
some
circumstances
rand
admitted
and
the
other
cecil
might
have
been
doing
funny
things
with
the
books
and
rivers
might
have
caught
him
that
would
also
be
a
good
enough
motive
it
would
also
rand
thought
furnish
an
explanation
for
the
burning
of
rivers
mention
it
to
mick
mckenna
he
hard
up
for
a
good
usable
suspect
and
by
the
way
the
news
of
this
killing
will
be
out
before
evening
but
in
the
meantime
i
wish
you
would
mention
it
to
anybody
or
mention
that
i
was
in
here
to
tell
you
about
it
i
wo
i
glad
you
told
me
though
do
you
think
there
may
be
a
chance
that
we
can
get
the
collection
now
i
would
know
why
not
rivers
offer
was
pretty
high
there
many
other
dealers
who
would
be
able
to
duplicate
it
well
do
take
any
czechoslovakian
stiegel
he
moved
his
car
down
the
street
to
the
rosemont
inn
where
he
went
into
the
combination
bar
and
grill
and
had
a
at
the
bar
then
he
ordered
lunch
and
while
waiting
for
it
went
into
a
and
dialed
the
number
of
stephen
gresham
office
in
new
belfast
i
hoped
to
catch
you
before
you
left
for
lunch
he
said
when
the
lawyer
answered
there
been
a
new
development
in
the
fleming
business
he
had
decided
to
follow
the
same
line
as
with
karen
lawrence
you
need
worry
about
arnold
rivers
offer
any
more
ha
so
he
backed
out
he
was
shoved
out
rand
corrected
on
the
sharp
end
of
a
mauser
bayonet
sometime
last
night
i
found
the
body
this
morning
when
i
went
to
see
him
and
notified
the
state
police
they
call
it
murder
but
of
course
they
just
prejudiced
i
call
it
a
project
look
here
are
you
kidding
gresham
demanded
i
never
kid
about
those
who
have
passed
on
rand
denied
piously
then
he
recited
the
already
hackneyed
description
of
what
had
happened
to
rivers
with
careful
attention
to
all
the
gruesome
details
so
i
called
copper
directly
sergeant
mckenna
up
a
stump
about
it
and
looking
in
all
directions
for
a
suspect
gresham
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
swore
softly
my
god
jeff
this
is
going
to
raise
all
kinds
of
hell
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
look
here
can
you
see
me
at
my
home
about
two
thirty
this
afternoon
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
rand
smiled
happily
this
looked
like
what
he
had
been
angling
for
maybe
arnold
rivers
had
died
in
vain
after
all
why
yes
i
can
make
it
he
replied
good
see
you
there
then
rand
assured
him
that
he
would
be
on
hand
when
he
returned
to
his
table
he
found
his
lunch
waiting
for
him
he
sat
down
and
ate
with
a
good
appetite
after
finishing
he
had
another
drink
and
sat
sipping
it
slowly
and
smoking
his
pipe
going
over
the
story
gladys
fleming
had
told
him
and
the
gossip
he
had
gotten
from
carter
tipton
and
the
other
statements
which
had
been
made
to
him
by
different
people
about
the
death
of
lane
fleming
and
the
conclusions
he
had
reached
about
the
theft
of
the
pistols
and
the
killing
of
arnold
rivers
sorting
out
the
inferences
from
the
descriptions
and
the
descriptive
statements
of
others
from
the
things
he
himself
had
observed
when
his
glass
was
empty
and
his
pipe
burned
out
he
left
a
tip
beside
the
ashtray
paid
his
check
and
went
out
he
had
two
hours
until
his
meeting
with
stephen
gresham
he
knew
exactly
where
to
spend
them
the
county
seat
was
a
normal
twenty
minutes
drive
from
rosemont
but
with
the
road
relatively
free
from
traffic
he
was
able
to
cut
that
to
fifteen
parking
his
car
in
front
of
the
courthouse
he
went
inside
the
coroner
one
jason
kirchner
was
an
little
fellow
with
a
caspar
milquetoast
mustache
and
an
underslung
jaw
he
wore
an
elks
watchcharm
an
odd
fellows
ring
and
a
knights
of
pythias
he
looked
at
rand
credentials
including
the
letter
humphrey
goode
had
given
him
with
some
bewilderment
you
working
for
mr
goode
he
asked
rather
needlessly
yes
i
see
handling
the
sale
of
fleming
pistols
for
the
estate
yes
that
must
be
interesting
work
rand
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
why
i
understand
you
have
an
item
from
that
collection
here
in
your
office
rand
said
the
pistol
with
which
fleming
shot
himself
regardless
of
its
unpleasant
associations
that
pistol
is
a
valuable
collector
item
and
one
of
the
assets
of
the
estate
if
i
to
get
full
value
for
the
collection
for
the
heirs
i
have
to
have
that
to
sell
with
the
rest
of
the
weapons
well
now
look
here
rand
kirchner
started
to
argue
that
revolver
a
dangerous
weapon
it
killed
one
man
already
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
let
it
get
out
where
it
might
kill
somebody
else
rand
estimated
that
this
situation
called
for
a
modified
version
of
his
act
you
think
you
can
show
cause
why
that
revolver
should
be
turned
over
to
the
fleming
estate
he
demanded
well
if
i
do
get
it
right
away
goode
will
get
a
court
order
for
it
you
had
no
right
to
impound
that
revolver
in
the
first
place
you
removed
it
from
the
fleming
home
illegally
in
the
second
place
since
you
had
no
intention
of
holding
any
formal
inquest
and
you
holding
it
illegally
now
a
court
order
might
not
be
all
we
could
get
either
he
added
menacingly
now
if
you
have
any
reason
to
suspect
that
fleming
committed
suicide
or
was
murdered
for
instance
oh
my
heavens
no
kirchner
cried
horrified
it
was
an
accident
pure
and
simple
i
so
certified
it
death
by
accident
due
to
inadvertence
of
the
deceased
well
then
rand
said
you
have
no
right
to
hold
that
revolver
and
i
want
it
right
now
as
goode
agent
i
responsible
for
that
collection
of
which
the
revolver
you
holding
is
a
part
that
revolver
is
too
valuable
an
asset
to
ignore
you
certainly
realize
that
well
i
do
have
any
intention
of
exceeding
my
authority
of
course
kirchner
disclaimed
hastily
and
i
certainly
would
want
to
go
against
goode
wishes
humphrey
goode
must
pull
considerable
weight
around
the
courthouse
rand
surmised
but
you
realize
that
revolver
still
loaded
oh
that
not
your
worry
i
draw
the
charges
or
better
fire
them
out
it
stood
one
shot
it
can
stand
the
other
five
well
would
you
mind
if
i
called
goode
on
the
phone
rand
did
decidedly
however
he
shook
his
head
negligently
certainly
not
go
ahead
and
call
him
by
all
means
the
coroner
went
away
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
carrying
a
revolver
in
both
hands
evidently
goode
had
given
him
the
green
light
he
approached
handling
the
weapon
with
a
caution
that
would
have
been
excessive
for
a
mills
grenade
after
warning
rand
again
that
it
was
loaded
he
laid
it
gently
on
his
desk
it
was
a
colt
one
of
the
series
with
the
round
barrel
and
the
creeping
somebody
had
wound
a
piece
of
wire
around
it
back
of
the
hammer
and
through
the
in
front
of
the
cylinder
as
the
hammer
was
down
on
a
fired
chamber
there
was
no
way
in
god
world
short
of
throwing
the
thing
into
a
furnace
in
which
it
could
be
discharged
but
kirchner
was
shrinking
away
from
it
as
though
it
might
jump
at
his
throat
i
put
the
wire
on
the
coroner
said
i
thought
it
might
be
safer
that
way
it
be
a
lot
safer
after
i
emptied
it
into
the
first
claybank
outside
town
rand
told
him
sorry
i
had
to
be
a
little
short
with
you
kirchner
but
you
know
how
it
is
i
responsible
to
goode
for
the
collection
and
this
gun
part
of
it
oh
that
all
right
i
really
should
have
taken
the
attitude
i
did
kirchner
met
him
halfway
after
i
talked
to
goode
of
course
i
knew
it
was
all
right
but
you
see
i
been
bothered
a
lot
about
that
pistol
lately
yes
rand
succeeded
in
being
negligent
about
it
oh
my
yes
the
newspaper
people
wanted
to
take
pictures
of
me
holding
it
and
then
there
was
an
who
was
here
trying
to
buy
it
who
was
that
arnold
rivers
why
yes
do
you
know
him
he
has
an
on
the
other
side
of
rosemont
he
does
sell
anything
but
guns
and
swords
and
that
sort
of
thing
kirchner
said
he
was
here
making
inquiries
about
it
and
my
clerk
showed
it
to
him
and
then
he
started
making
offers
for
it
first
ten
dollars
and
then
fifteen
and
then
twenty
he
got
up
as
high
as
sixty
dollars
i
suppose
it
worth
a
couple
of
hundred
it
was
probably
worth
about
rand
was
intrigued
by
this
second
instance
of
an
willingness
to
spare
no
expense
to
get
possession
of
a
percussion
revolver
did
he
have
it
in
his
hands
he
asked
oh
yes
he
looked
it
over
carefully
i
suppose
he
thought
he
could
get
a
lot
of
money
for
it
because
of
the
accident
and
fleming
being
such
a
prominent
man
kirchner
suggested
rand
allowed
himself
to
be
struck
by
an
idea
say
you
know
that
make
it
worth
more
at
that
he
exclaimed
what
do
you
know
i
never
thought
of
that
look
kirchner
supposed
to
get
as
much
money
for
these
pistols
for
the
heirs
as
i
can
how
would
you
like
to
give
me
a
letter
vouching
for
this
as
the
pistol
fleming
killed
himself
with
put
in
how
you
found
it
in
his
hand
and
mention
the
serial
numbers
so
that
whoever
buys
it
will
know
it
the
same
revolver
he
picked
up
the
colt
and
showed
kirchner
the
serials
on
the
butt
and
in
front
of
the
see
here
it
is
kirchner
would
be
more
than
willing
to
oblige
goode
agent
he
typed
out
the
letter
himself
looked
twice
at
the
revolver
to
make
sure
of
the
number
took
rand
word
for
the
make
model
and
caliber
signed
it
and
even
slammed
his
seal
down
on
it
rand
thanked
him
profusely
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
stuck
the
colt
down
his
about
two
miles
from
the
county
seat
rand
stopped
his
car
on
a
deserted
stretch
of
road
and
got
out
unwinding
the
wire
kirchner
had
wrapped
around
the
revolver
he
picked
up
an
empty
from
the
ditch
set
it
against
an
embankment
stepped
back
about
thirty
feet
and
began
firing
the
first
shot
kicked
up
dirt
a
little
over
the
can
rand
never
could
be
sure
just
how
high
any
percussion
colt
was
sighted
and
the
other
four
hit
the
can
he
carried
the
revolver
back
to
the
car
and
put
it
into
the
with
the
leech
rigdon
after
starting
the
car
he
snapped
on
the
radio
in
time
for
the
two
fifteen
from
the
new
belfast
station
as
he
had
expected
the
murder
was
out
the
daily
budget
of
strikes
and
congressional
investigations
and
international
turmoil
was
enlivened
by
a
more
or
less
imaginative
account
of
what
had
already
been
christened
the
rosemont
bayonet
murder
rand
resigned
himself
to
the
inevitable
influx
of
reporters
then
he
swore
as
the
newscaster
continued
district
attorney
charles
farnsworth
of
scott
county
who
has
taken
charge
of
the
investigation
says
and
we
quote
is
strong
evidence
implicating
certain
prominent
persons
whom
we
are
not
as
yet
prepared
to
name
and
if
the
investigation
now
under
way
and
making
excellent
progress
justifies
they
will
be
apprehended
and
formally
charged
no
effort
will
be
spared
and
no
consideration
of
personal
prominence
will
be
allowed
to
deter
us
from
clearing
up
this
dastardly
crime
rand
swore
again
with
weary
bitterness
wondering
how
much
trouble
he
was
going
to
have
with
district
attorney
charles
farnsworth
as
he
pulled
to
a
stop
in
stephen
gresham
driveway
chapter
gresham
must
have
been
waiting
inside
the
door
as
soon
as
rand
came
up
onto
the
porch
he
opened
it
and
motioned
the
detective
inside
beyond
a
hasty
greeting
as
rand
passed
the
threshold
he
did
not
speak
until
they
were
seated
in
the
gunroom
upstairs
then
he
came
straight
to
the
point
jeff
can
you
spare
the
time
from
this
work
you
doing
at
the
flemings
to
investigate
this
rivers
business
he
asked
and
how
much
would
an
investigation
cost
me
it
got
to
be
a
blitz
job
i
not
interested
in
getting
anybody
convicted
in
court
i
just
want
the
case
cleared
up
in
a
hurry
well
rand
puffed
at
the
cigar
gresham
had
given
him
watching
the
ash
form
on
the
end
i
do
work
by
the
day
stephen
i
take
a
fee
and
of
course
it
to
my
interest
to
get
a
case
cleared
up
as
soon
as
i
can
but
i
ca
set
any
time
limit
on
a
job
like
this
this
rivers
killing
has
more
angles
than
descending
a
i
do
know
how
much
work
i
have
to
do
or
even
what
kind
well
it
have
to
be
fast
gresham
told
him
urgently
look
i
kill
arnold
rivers
i
hated
his
guts
and
i
think
whoever
did
it
ought
to
get
a
medal
and
a
testimonial
dinner
but
i
did
not
kill
him
you
believe
me
i
inclined
to
rand
replied
in
your
law
practice
you
know
what
a
lying
client
is
letting
himself
in
for
as
my
client
you
would
lie
to
me
you
seem
to
think
you
may
be
suspected
of
purging
rivers
but
why
is
there
any
reason
aside
from
that
homemade
north
cheney
he
sold
you
why
anybody
would
think
you
killed
him
great
god
yes
gresham
exclaimed
now
look
i
not
worried
about
being
railroaded
for
this
i
did
do
it
and
i
can
beat
any
case
that
farnsworth
could
dream
up
against
me
but
i
ca
afford
even
to
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
this
you
know
what
that
would
do
to
me
in
town
i
just
ca
get
mixed
up
in
this
at
all
i
want
you
to
see
to
it
that
i
do
that
sounds
like
a
large
order
the
ash
was
growing
on
rand
cigar
he
took
another
heavy
drag
at
it
but
why
necessarily
you
rivers
had
plenty
of
other
enemies
yes
but
dammit
they
were
all
in
his
shop
last
evening
just
me
and
one
other
the
one
who
killed
him
on
your
way
out
from
town
rand
inquired
yes
i
stopped
at
his
place
about
a
quarter
to
nine
i
was
sore
as
hell
about
the
hooking
he
gave
me
on
that
north
cheney
falsely
and
i
decided
to
stop
and
have
it
out
with
him
we
had
words
most
of
them
unpleasant
i
told
him
for
one
thing
that
lane
fleming
death
had
pulled
his
bacon
off
the
fire
that
i
was
going
to
start
the
same
sort
of
action
against
him
on
my
own
account
but
that
is
the
point
the
point
is
that
when
i
was
going
in
this
clerk
of
his
cecil
gillis
was
coming
out
he
got
into
his
car
and
drove
away
leaving
me
alone
with
rivers
he
be
the
first
one
the
police
talk
to
and
tell
them
all
about
it
that
does
put
you
back
of
the
eight
ball
rand
dropped
the
ash
into
a
tray
and
looked
at
it
curiously
it
looked
like
the
sort
of
ash
he
had
seen
at
rivers
shop
but
he
could
be
sure
but
if
it
can
be
proved
that
rivers
was
alive
after
nine
twenty
when
you
got
here
you
be
in
the
clear
i
do
want
to
have
to
clear
myself
gresham
insisted
i
do
want
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all
here
i
pay
you
a
thousand
down
and
two
more
when
you
have
the
case
completed
i
want
you
to
get
the
murder
cleared
up
before
i
can
be
publicly
involved
in
it
i
say
publicly
because
this
damned
gillis
has
probably
involved
me
with
the
police
already
well
gillis
is
exactly
in
a
state
of
pure
sanctity
himself
rand
commented
as
a
suspect
the
smart
handicappers
are
figuring
him
to
run
well
inside
the
money
for
instance
you
know
there
have
been
stories
about
him
and
mrs
rivers
gresham
snapped
his
fingers
damned
if
there
have
now
he
said
you
talk
to
adam
trehearne
he
did
business
with
rivers
there
much
in
his
line
rivers
and
umholtz
were
able
to
fake
and
different
times
he
gone
to
rivers
shop
and
there
be
nobody
around
and
then
gillis
would
come
in
from
the
house
smelling
of
chanel
number
five
rivers
uses
chanel
number
five
maybe
you
have
something
there
if
cecil
thought
he
could
marry
the
business
with
rivers
out
of
the
way
you
take
the
case
wo
you
jeff
oh
certainly
rand
assured
him
now
all
they
have
on
you
is
that
there
was
between
you
and
rivers
about
that
fake
north
cheney
and
that
you
were
in
rivers
shop
yesterday
evening
rand
new
client
grimaced
i
wish
that
were
all
he
said
the
worst
part
of
it
is
the
way
rivers
was
killed
see
back
in
kaiser
war
before
i
was
assigned
a
company
of
my
own
i
was
regimental
officer
and
after
we
got
to
france
i
always
carried
a
rifle
and
bayonet
at
the
front
hell
i
must
have
killed
close
to
a
dozen
krauts
just
the
way
rivers
was
killed
and
during
schicklgruber
war
i
volunteered
as
bayonet
instructor
for
the
local
home
guard
my
god
rand
made
a
wry
face
there
must
be
close
to
a
hundred
people
around
here
who
know
that
and
all
of
them
are
probably
convinced
that
you
killed
rivers
and
are
expressing
that
opinion
at
the
top
of
their
voices
to
all
comers
you
do
want
a
detective
you
want
a
magician
he
took
another
drag
at
the
cigar
and
blew
smoke
through
a
circular
beside
him
what
sort
of
a
character
is
this
farnsworth
anyhow
he
asked
before
the
war
i
had
all
the
in
the
state
typed
and
estimated
but
since
i
got
back
gresham
slandered
the
county
prosecutor
legitimacy
little
egotist
he
running
for
this
year
too
one
way
that
could
be
bad
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
easy
to
throw
a
scare
into
him
stephen
when
you
were
at
rivers
were
you
smoking
a
cigar
gresham
shook
his
head
no
i
threw
my
cigar
away
when
i
got
out
of
the
car
and
i
did
light
another
one
till
i
got
home
if
you
remember
i
was
lighting
it
when
i
came
in
here
yes
so
you
were
well
i
do
suppose
in
view
of
the
state
of
relations
between
you
and
rivers
that
you
had
a
drink
with
him
either
i
would
drink
that
guy
liquor
if
i
were
dying
of
snakebite
and
he
would
offer
me
a
drink
if
he
knew
i
was
gresham
declared
well
did
you
notice
back
near
the
fireplace
a
low
table
with
a
fifth
of
haig
haig
pinchbottle
and
a
couple
of
glasses
and
a
siphon
and
so
on
on
it
i
saw
the
table
there
was
an
ashtray
on
it
and
a
book
i
think
it
was
gluckman
states
martial
pistols
and
but
no
bottle
or
siphon
or
glasses
all
right
then
it
was
the
killer
rand
explained
about
the
drinks
and
the
he
went
on
to
tell
about
the
destruction
of
i
do
get
that
gresham
was
puzzled
unless
it
was
young
gillis
after
all
he
could
have
been
knocking
down
on
rivers
and
rivers
caught
him
at
it
i
thought
of
that
rand
admitted
but
i
doubt
if
rivers
would
sit
down
and
drink
with
him
while
accusing
him
of
theft
and
i
ca
seem
to
find
anything
around
rivers
place
that
looks
as
though
it
might
have
been
stolen
from
the
fleming
collection
either
oh
and
that
reminds
me
if
you
have
time
this
afternoon
i
wonder
if
you
come
along
with
me
to
the
flemings
and
see
just
what
missing
i
have
to
know
that
in
any
case
and
there
a
good
possibility
that
the
thefts
from
the
collection
and
the
killing
of
rivers
are
related
yes
of
course
gresham
agreed
and
suppose
we
take
pierre
jarrett
along
with
us
he
knows
that
collection
as
well
as
i
do
he
spot
anything
i
miss
he
works
at
home
i
call
him
now
we
can
pick
him
up
before
we
go
to
the
flemings
they
went
into
gresham
bedroom
where
there
was
a
phone
and
gresham
talked
to
pierre
jarrett
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
pick
jarrett
up
with
his
car
and
come
to
the
flemings
while
rand
went
there
directly
then
rand
used
the
phone
to
call
his
office
in
new
belfast
he
talked
to
dave
ritter
explaining
the
situation
to
date
i
going
to
need
some
help
he
continued
i
want
you
to
come

name

five
thirty
and

fleming

i
want

gun

a
little
too
conspicuous
you

a
beretta

top
drawer
of
my
office
desk
with
a
box
of
ammunition
and
a
couple
of
spare
clips
right

ritter
promised
and
say

in
this
morning

a
lot
of

the
fleming
estate

of
hours
he
parted
from
gresham
going
out
and
getting
in
his
car
as
gresham
got
his
own
car
out
of
the
garage
and
drove
off
toward
pierre
house
rand
started
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
rosemont
about
a
from
gresham
he
caught
an
advancing
gleam
of
white
on
the
highway
ahead
of
him
and
pulled
to
the
side
of
the
road
waiting
until
the
state
police
car
drew
up
and
stopped
in
it
were
mick
mckenna
aarvo
kavaalen
and
a
third
man
a
nordic
type
in
an
untidy
brown
suit
hi
jeff
mckenna
greeted
him
as
rand
got
out
of
his
car
and
came
across
the
road
this
is
gus
olsen
investigator
for
the
office
jeff
rand
agency
he
introduced
hey
olsen
yelled
we
been
lookin
for
you
where
you
been
rand
raised
an
eyebrow
at
mckenna
you
just
came
from
where
we
going
the
state
police
sergeant
surmised
was
gresham
at
home
he
was
he
gone
now
rand
said
he
and
another
man
are
going
to
help
me
check
up
on
what
missing
from
the
fleming
collection
hey
olsen
exploded
what
i
told
you
now
he
run
ahead
of
us
with
a
gresham
skipped
out
now
what
is
all
this
rand
wanted
to
know
what
he
screaming
about
mick
like
he
do
know
olsen
vociferated
he
tipped
off
gresham
so
he
could
skip
out
i
bet
he
in
it
with
gresham
pay
no
attention
mckenna
advised
he
does
know
what
the
score
is
hell
he
does
even
know
what
teams
are
playing
now
you
look
here
olsen
bawled
we
see
what
farnsworth
has
to
say
about
this
you
supposed
to
cooperate
with
us
not
go
with
a
lot
of
suspects
why
it
plain
as
anything
him
and
in
it
together
i
bet
that
was
why
he
come
around
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
find
the
body
kavaalen
behind
the
wheel
turned
around
and
began
jabbering
at
olsen
in
the
back
seat
in
something
that
sounded
like
swedish
most
finns
can
speak
swedish
and
rand
was
wishing
he
could
understand
it
the
corporal
remarks
ran
to
about
a
paragraph
and
must
have
been
downright
incendiary
at
least
olsen
seemed
to
catch
fire
from
them
he
rose
in
his
seat
waving
his
arms
and
howling
back
in
the
same
language
shut
up
goddammit
mckenna
bellowed
into
his
face
shut
up
before
i
sling
your
ass
to
hell
out
of
this
car
i
talking
and
i
want
any
goddam
jaw
from
you
olsen
you
either
he
barked
at
kavaalen
winking
at
him
at
the
same
time
silence
fell
with
a
heavy
thump
in
the
car
well
now
that
the
international
crisis
seems
to
have
been
averted
how
about
letting
me
in
on
it
too
rand
asked
for
instance
what
about
gresham
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
suspect
for
ah
olsen
suspects
him
of
chopping
rivers
up
mckenna
replied
wearily
see
we
questioned
this
cecil
gillis
and
he
told
us
that
last
evening
as
he
was
leaving
rivers
he
saw
stephen
gresham
drive
up
and
go
into
the
shop
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
myself
i
thought
he
might
account
for
the
and
the
on
that
table
but
when
farnsworth
heard
about
the
killing
he
sent
olsen
around
and
when
olsen
heard
that
gresham
had
been
there
he
tried
him
and
convicted
him
on
the
spot
oh
obscenity
is
that
what
it
about
rand
exclaimed
in
disgust
yes
gresham
told
me
about
that
he
did
have
the
drink
and
he
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
shop
and
he
left
a
little
after
nine
he
got
home
at
nine
i
can
testify
to
that
myself
i
was
there
at
the
time
and
so
were
seven
other
people
rand
named
them
they
dribbled
away
at
different
times
during
the
evening
but
philip
cabot
and
i
stayed
till
around
eleven
he
mentioned
the
approximate
time
at
which
the
others
had
left
what
time
was
rivers
killed
or
has
the
time
been
fixed
the
says
around
ten
to
two
mckenna
said
he
could
be
wrong
them
guys
only
guess
half
the
time
olsen
argued
and
besides
gresham
had
it
in
for
rivers
and
that
ai
all
neither
he
knew
how
to
use
a
bayonet
too
i
seen
him
myself
during
the
war
showin
the
home
guard
how
to
do
it
just
the
way
rivers
was
killed
he
produced
triumphantly
mckenna
used
a
dirty
word
so
what
anybody
who
ever
had
infantry
training
knows
that
he
retorted
i
learned
it
myself
when
i
was
a
kid
in
and
in
hell
anybody
ever
seen
a
if
you
had
lammed
out
of
sweden
when
you
were
sixteen
to
duck
conscription
you
of
known
it
too
well
maybe
olsen
or
his
boss
can
explain
why
gresham
threw
those
in
the
fire
rand
contributed
you
know
why
olsen
says
gresham
had
it
in
for
rivers
rivers
sold
gresham
a
fake
antique
a
flint
lock
navy
pistol
that
had
been
worked
over
into
something
else
gresham
was
going
to
subpoena
those
records
when
he
brought
suit
against
rivers
rand
lied
but
i
can
explain
why
cecil
gillis
might
have
destroyed
them
after
killing
rivers
if
he
been
cheating
rivers
and
rivers
caught
him
at
it
yeah
and
that
might
explain
why
gillis
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
sic
us
onto
gresham
too
mckenna
added
i
thought
of
something
like
that
and
this
girl
that
works
for
rivers
says
that
gillis
and
rivers
played
all
kinds
of
games
together
when
rivers
was
away
well
who
in
charge
of
the
investigation
rand
wanted
to
know
i
heard
on
the
radio
you
liable
to
hear
anything
on
the
radio
including
slanders
on
bing
crosby
horses
but
for
the
record
i
am
in
charge
of
this
investigation
and
do
anybody
forget
it
either
he
added
in
the
direction
of
the
rear
seat
that
what
i
thought
well
stephen
gresham
has
just
retained
me
to
make
an
independent
investigation
rand
said
it
is
not
that
he
lacks
confidence
in
the
state
police
or
in
you
he
was
afraid
that
other
parties
might
get
into
the
act
and
try
to
make
political
capital
out
of
it
which
appears
to
have
happened
well
if
gresham
retained
you
i
satisfied
mckenna
said
you
can
take
care
of
that
end
of
it
glad
you
in
with
us
well
i
ai
satisfied
olsen
began
yelling
again
and
farnsworth
wo
be
neither
why
this
here
private
dick
is
like
as
not
workin
for
the
very
man
that
killed
rivers
mckenna
turned
slowly
in
his
seat
to
face
olsen
one
time
ten
years
ago
he
began
jeff
rand
had
a
client
who
was
guilty
of
the
crime
he
hired
jeff
to
investigate
it
was
an
arson
case
this
guy
set
fire
to
his
own
factory
and
then
got
jeff
to
run
down
a
lot
of
fake
clues
he
planted
i
know
about
that
i
was
on
the
case
myself
that
where
i
first
met
jeff
and
he
saved
me
from
making
a
jackass
out
of
myself
and
what
happened
to
this
guy
who
hired
jeff
was
something
that
ought
to
happen
even
to
molotov
and
it
happened
because
jeff
fixed
it
to
happen
if
anybody
hires
jeff
rand
he
one
of
two
things
he
either
innocent
or
else
he
out
of
luck
i
do
know
why
the
hell
i
bother
telling
you
this
ten
to
two
you
say
rand
considered
look
a
couple
of
days
ago
rivers
put
out
a
new
to
his
regular
customers
a
lot
of
them
in
different
parts
of
the
country
order
by
telephone
and
some
of
them
live
in
the
west
where
there
a
couple
of
hours
one
of
them
calling
at
say
eight
local
time
would
get
his
call
in
at
ten
eastern
standard
if
you
checked
the
calls
to
rivers
number
last
night
now
you
might
get
something
yeah
and
if
he
took
a
call
after
nine
that
would
let
gresham
out
even
farnsworth
could
figure
that
out
sure
i
check
right
away
who
at
rivers
now
skinner
and
jameson
of
our
gang
and
farnsworth
and
some
of
his
outfit
and
the
hell
own
slew
of
reporters
of
course
mckenna
said
aarvo
going
back
there
in
a
little
we
still
trying
to
locate
rivers
we
have
been
able
to
yet
the
maid
says
she
went
to
new
york
day
before
yesterday
i
probably
be
around
at
rivers
later
in
the
day
i
want
to
check
on
that
fleming
angle
i
be
there
in
half
an
hour
corporal
kavaalen
said
be
seeing
you
they
exchanged
and
kavaalen
backed
and
made
a
moving
off
in
the
direction
of
rosemont
olsen
voluble
protests
drifted
back
as
the
car
receded
rand
returned
to
his
own
car
and
followed
chapter
rand
found
gladys
alone
in
the
library
as
she
rose
to
greet
him
he
came
close
to
her
gesturing
for
silence
with
finger
on
lips
there
a
perfect
hell
of
a
mess
he
whispered
somebody
murdered
arnold
rivers
last
night
she
looked
at
him
in
horror
murdered
who
was
it
how
did
it
i
have
time
to
talk
about
that
right
now
he
told
her
stephen
gresham
and
pierre
jarrett
are
on
their
way
here
and
i
like
you
to
keep
the
servants
and
particularly
walters
out
of
earshot
of
the
gunroom
while
they
here
it
seems
that
a
number
of
the
best
pistols
have
been
stolen
from
the
collection
sometime
between
the
death
of
fleming
and
the
time
i
saw
the
collection
yesterday
stephen
and
pierre
are
going
to
help
me
find
out
just
what
been
taken
i
have
an
idea
they
might
have
been
sold
to
rivers
that
may
have
been
why
he
was
killed
to
prevent
him
from
implicating
the
thief
you
think
somebody
here
the
servants
she
asked
i
ca
see
how
it
could
have
been
an
outsider
the
stuff
was
all
taken
at
once
it
must
have
been
moved
out
a
piece
at
a
time
and
worthless
pistols
moved
in
and
hung
on
the
racks
to
replace
valuable
pistols
taken
he
had
left
the
library
door
purposely
open
when
the
doorbell
rang
he
heard
it
i
let
them
in
he
said
you
go
and
head
walters
off
rand
hurried
to
the
front
door
and
admitted
gresham
and
pierre
hustling
them
down
the
hall
into
the
library
and
up
the
spiral
to
the
gunroom
while
gladys
went
to
the
foot
of
the
front
stairs
through
the
open
gunroom
door
rand
could
hear
her
speaking
to
walters
as
though
sending
him
on
some
errand
to
the
rear
of
the
house
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
to
the
others
we
have
to
make
it
fast
he
said
fleming
ca
hold
the
butler
off
all
day
let
start
over
here
and
go
around
the
racks
they
began
at
the
left
with
the
wheel
locks
pierre
put
his
finger
immediately
on
the
shabby
and
disreputable
specimen
rand
had
first
noticed
phew
is
that
one
a
stinker
he
said
what
used
to
be
there
was
a
nice
late
or
early
north
italian
pistol
all
covered
with
steel
a
real
beauty
much
better
than
average
those
turkish
atrocities
gresham
pointed
out
they
filling
in
for
a
pair
of
lazarino
cominazo
snaphaunces
that
lane
fleming
paid
seven
hundred
for
back
in
the
and
did
pay
a
cent
too
much
for
even
then
worth
an
easy
thousand
now
remember
the
pair
of
cominazo
flintlocks
illustrated
in
pollard
history
of
these
were
even
better
and
snaphaunces
well
you
go
over
the
collection
rand
told
them
note
down
anything
you
find
missing
he
handed
them
a
pad
of
paper
and
a
pencil
from
the
desk
i
have
something
else
to
do
for
a
few
minutes
with
that
he
left
them
scrutinizing
the
pistols
on
the
wall
and
went
to
the
workbench
in
the
corner
drawing
the
colt
from
under
his
waistband
working
rapidly
he
dismounted
it
taking
off
the
barrel
and
cylinder
and
cleaned
it
thoroughly
before
putting
it
together
again
pierre
and
gresham
had
just
started
on
the
colts
when
he
slipped
the
revolver
out
of
sight
and
rejoined
them
it
took
over
a
to
finish
when
they
had
gotten
completely
around
the
collection
rand
had
a
list
of
missing
items
including
four
cased
sets
at
a
conservative
estimate
the
missing
pistols
were
worth
ten
to
twelve
thousand
dollars
dealer
list
value
the
stuff
that
had
been
moved
in
to
replace
them
might
have
a
value
of
two
or
three
hundred
but
no
serious
collector
would
buy
any
of
it
at
any
price
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
replace
the
cased
items
the
cases
had
been
merely
rearranged
on
the
table
to
avoid
any
conspicuous
vacancies
see
that
thing
pierre
asked
tapping
a
small
webley
scott
automatic
with
his
finger
rand
looked
at
it
it
had
been
fitted
with
an
silencer
that
thing
pierre
said
is
the
one
illustrated
in
pollard
book
the
identical
pistol
it
used
to
be
in
the
pollard
collection
lane
had
a
lot
of
stuff
from
some
famous
collections
gresham
said
pollard
collection
sawyer
collection
fred
hines
collection
meeks
collection
even
the
old
mark
field
collection
that
was
sold
at
libbie
galleries
in
his
own
could
rank
with
any
of
them
think
you
can
get
any
of
this
stuff
back
i
hope
so
by
the
way
where
does
this
fellow
umholtz
the
fabricator
of
spurious
whitneyville
walker
colts
hang
out
i
believe
he
ought
to
be
looked
into
say
that
an
idea
pierre
ejaculated
he
might
have
bought
the
pistols
instead
of
rivers
why
he
has
a
gunshop
at
kingsville
on
route
about
fifteen
miles
west
of
here
just
this
side
of
the
village
he
had
a
big
sign
along
the
road
and
his
shop
in
the
barn
behind
the
house
i
have
to
check
up
on
him
but
first
i
want
to
see
if
any
of
this
stuff
at
rivers
shop
i
wo
ask
you
to
come
along
he
told
gresham
no
use
you
sticking
your
head
into
the
lion
mouth
talked
the
state
police
temporarily
off
your
trail
but
i
still
have
farnsworth
to
worry
about
he
like
to
prosecute
a
big
corporation
lawyer
if
he
thought
he
had
any
chance
of
getting
a
conviction
pierre
said
make
a
nice
impression
on
the
proletarian
vote
in
the
south
end
of
the
county
you
a
member
of
the
mohawk
club
in
new
belfast
are
you
rand
asked
gresham
well
go
there
and
stay
there
for
a
couple
of
days
till
the
heat
off
pierre
you
can
come
with
me
to
rivers
i
run
you
home
in
my
car
when
we
through
gresham
let
himself
out
the
front
door
pierre
and
rand
went
out
through
the
garage
and
got
into
rand
car
you
have
any
idea
so
far
about
who
could
have
killed
rivers
the
asked
as
they
coasted
down
the
drive
to
the
highway
i
have
even
the
start
of
an
idea
rand
said
he
ran
briefly
over
what
he
knew
or
at
least
those
items
which
were
likely
to
become
public
knowledge
soon
from
what
i
observed
at
the
shop
and
from
what
i
know
of
rivers
character
i
think
that
he
been
in
some
kind
of
a
crooked
deal
with
somebody
and
got
or
else
the
other
man
caught
rivers
him
or
else
rivers
and
somebody
else
had
some
secret
in
common
and
the
other
man
wanted
a
monopoly
on
it
and
killed
rivers
as
a
security
measure
think
it
might
be
the
fleming
pistols
that
depends
i
have
to
see
whether
any
of
the
fleming
pistols
turn
up
anywhere
in
rivers
former
possession
personally
i
about
decided
that
the
man
who
was
drinking
with
rivers
killed
him
there
are
any
indications
that
anybody
else
was
in
the
shop
afterward
if
that
the
case
i
doubt
if
the
killer
was
walters
you
know
what
a
snobbish
guy
rivers
was
and
from
what
i
know
of
him
he
seems
to
have
had
a
thoroughly
aristotelian
outlook
he
identified
individuals
with
walters
of
course
would
be
identified
with
the
label
and
i
ca
imagine
rivers
sitting
down
and
drinking
with
a
he
would
only
drink
with
people
whom
he
thought
of
as
his
equals
that
is
people
whom
he
identified
with
of
equal
social
importance
to
his
own
labels
of
and
that
sounds
like
korzybski
pierre
said
as
they
turned
onto
route
in
the
village
and
headed
east
you
read
and
rand
nodded
yes
i
first
read
it
in
the
edition
back
about
i
been
rereading
it
every
couple
of
years
since
the
principles
of
general
semantics
come
in
very
handy
in
my
business
especially
in
work
like
this
a
consciousness
of
abstracting
a
realization
that
we
can
only
know
something
about
a
thin
film
of
events
on
the
surface
of
any
given
situation
and
a
habit
of
thinking
structurally
and
of
individual
things
instead
of
verbally
and
of
categories
saves
a
lot
of
chasing
and
they
suggest
a
great
many
more
avenues
of
investigation
than
would
be
evident
to
one
whose
thinking
is
limited
by
intensional
verbal
categories
yes
i
find
general
semantics
helpful
in
my
work
too
pierre
said
i
can
use
it
in
plotting
a
story
the
gentlemen
of
the
press
rand
said
looking
ahead
as
the
car
approached
the
rivers
house
and
shop
there
has
been
a
good
sensational
murder
story
for
some
time
this
is
a
gift
from
the
gods
a
swarm
of
cars
were
parked
in
front
and
beside
the
house
among
them
rand
spotted
a
green
sedan
of
the
new
belfast
and
a
black
coupé
bearing
the
blazonry
of
the
new
belfast
cars
from
a
couple
of
papers
at
louisburg
the
state
capital
and
cars
from
papers
as
far
distant
as
pittsburgh
buffalo
and
cincinnati
in
front
of
the
shop
a
motley
assemblage
of
journalists
was
interviewing
and
photographing
an
undersized
runt
in
a
tan
chesterfield
topcoat
and
a
gray
homburg
hat
whom
they
were
addressing
as
farnsworth
the
district
attorney
of
scott
county
had
a
mustache
which
failed
miserably
to
make
him
look
like
tom
dewey
he
impressed
rand
as
the
sort
of
offensive
little
squirt
who
compensates
for
his
general
insignificance
by
bad
manners
and
corporal
kavaalen
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
caught
sight
of
rand
and
his
companion
as
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
came
to
meet
them
hustling
them
around
the
crowd
and
into
the
shop
before
anybody
could
notice
and
recognize
them
that
was
a
good
tip
about
the
telephone
he
said
softly
mick
checked
at
the
rosemont
exchange
rivers
got
a
call
from
topeka
last
night
ten
fifteen
to
ten
seventeen
we
got
the
night
long
distance
operator
out
of
bed
and
she
confirmed
it
rivers
took
the
call
himself
he
gets
a
lot
of
long
distance
calls
in
the
evenings
she
knew
his
voice
he
corrected
himself
shifting
to
the
past
tense
and
glancing
as
he
did
at
the
chalk
outline
on
the
floor
now
scuffed
by
many
feet
and
the
dried
bloodstains
you
say
this
puts
gresham
in
the
clear
absolutely
rand
assured
him
he
was
at
home
from
nine
on
he
introduced
pierre
jarrett
and
explained
their
mission
you
find
anything
except
what
here
in
the
shop
only
rivers
own
smith
wesson
in
his
room
and
a
lot
of
pistols
out
in
the
garage
that
look
like
junk
to
me
kavaalen
said
i
show
them
to
you
rand
nodded
pierre
you
look
around
the
shop
i
see
what
this
other
stuff
is
he
followed
kavaalen
through
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
shop
the
same
one
through
which
cecil
gillis
had
carried
the
kentucky
rifle
the
afternoon
before
beside
rivers
car
there
was
a
long
workbench
in
the
garage
and
piles
of
wood
and
cardboard
cartons
and
stacks
of
newspapers
and
a
barrel
full
of
excelsior
all
evidently
used
in
preparing
arms
for
shipment
there
was
also
a
large
pile
of
old
pistols
and
a
number
of
rand
pawed
among
the
pistols
they
were
as
the
state
police
corporal
had
said
all
junk
the
sort
of
things
a
dealer
has
to
buy
at
times
in
order
to
get
something
really
good
many
of
them
had
been
partially
dismantled
for
parts
when
he
was
certain
that
the
heap
of
did
conceal
anything
of
value
he
returned
to
the
shop
pierre
was
waiting
for
him
by
rivers
desk
he
shook
his
head
not
a
thing
he
reported
i
found
a
couple
of
fakes
and
about
ten
or
fifteen
that
had
been
altered
in
one
way
or
another
and
a
lot
of
reblued
stuff
but
nothing
from
collection
what
did
you
find
rand
laughed
i
found
rivers
and
some
pistols
that
probably
contributed
parts
to
some
of
the
stuff
you
found
he
said
of
course
all
we
can
say
is
that
the
stuff
is
here
rivers
could
have
bought
it
and
stored
it
outside
somewhere
but
even
so
i
not
taking
the
fleming
butler
too
seriously
as
a
suspect
for
the
murder
what
this
about
fleming
butler
a
voice
broke
in
have
you
been
withholding
information
from
me
rand
turned
to
find
that
farnsworth
had
left
the
press
conference
in
front
and
up
on
him
from
behind
i
withheld
a
theory
which
seems
to
have
come
to
nothing
he
replied
kavaalen
told
the
who
rand
was
he
cooperating
with
us
he
added
sergeant
mckenna
instructed
us
to
give
him
every
consideration
it
seems
that
a
number
of
valuable
pistols
were
stolen
from
the
collection
of
the
late
lane
fleming
rand
said
we
suspected
that
the
butler
had
stolen
them
and
sold
them
to
rivers
i
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
also
have
killed
rivers
to
silence
him
about
the
transaction
he
shrugged
none
of
the
stolen
items
have
turned
up
here
so
there
nothing
to
connect
the
thefts
with
the
death
of
rivers
good
heavens
you
certainly
did
suspect
a
prominent
and
respected
citizen
like
rivers
of
receiving
stolen
goods
farnsworth
demanded
aghast
who
respects
him
rand
hooted
rivers
was
a
notorious
swindler
he
had
that
reputation
among
all
over
the
country
he
was
expelled
from
membership
in
the
national
rifle
association
for
misrepresentation
and
fraud
why
he
even
swindled
lane
fleming
on
a
pair
of
fake
pistols
a
week
or
so
before
fleming
death
and
the
very
reason
why
your
man
olsen
was
inclined
to
suspect
stephen
gresham
was
that
he
had
had
trouble
with
rivers
about
a
crooked
deal
rivers
had
put
over
on
him
fortunately
gresham
has
since
been
cleared
of
any
suspicion
but
who
says
he
been
cleared
farnsworth
snapped
he
still
a
suspect
sergeant
mckenna
says
so
corporal
kavaalen
declared
he
has
been
cleared
i
guess
we
just
did
get
around
to
telling
you
about
that
he
went
on
to
explain
about
the
long
distance
call
that
had
furnished
stephen
gresham
alibi
and
gresham
was
at
home
from
nine
on
rand
added
there
are
eight
witnesses
to
that
his
wife
and
daughter
myself
captain
jarrett
here
and
his
fiancée
miss
lawrence
philip
cabot
adam
trehearne
colin
macbride
farnsworth
looked
bewildered
why
was
i
told
about
that
he
demanded
sulkily
sergeant
mckenna
been
too
busy
and
i
did
think
of
it
kavaalen
said
insolently
i
not
supposed
to
report
to
you
anyhow
why
your
man
olsen
tell
you
he
was
with
us
when
we
checked
with
the
telephone
company
farnsworth
tried
to
ignore
that
by
questioning
pierre
about
the
time
of
gresham
arrival
home
then
turned
to
rand
and
wanted
to
know
what
the
latter
interest
in
the
case
was
rand
told
him
about
his
work
in
connection
with
the
fleming
collection
producing
humphrey
goode
letter
of
authorization
farnsworth
seemed
impressed
in
about
the
same
way
as
the
coroner
kirchner
but
he
was
still
puzzled
but
i
understood
that
you
had
been
retained
by
stephen
gresham
to
investigate
this
murder
he
said
so
you
did
talk
to
olsen
after
i
saw
him
rand
pounced
odd
he
mention
this
telephone
thing
why
yes
that
true
my
agency
handles
all
sorts
of
business
the
two
operations
are
mutually
exclusive
for
a
while
i
even
thought
they
might
be
related
but
now
he
shrugged
well
you
believe
now
that
rivers
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
pistols
you
say
were
stolen
from
the
fleming
collection
farnsworth
asked
rand
shook
his
head
ambiguously
farnsworth
took
that
for
a
negative
answer
to
his
question
as
he
was
intended
to
and
you
say
gresham
has
been
completely
cleared
of
any
suspicion
of
complicity
in
this
murder
rand
helping
us
we
want
him
to
stick
around
till
the
case
is
closed
corporal
kavaalen
threw
in
perceiving
the
drift
of
questions
he
and
sergeant
mckenna
have
worked
together
before
given
us
a
lot
of
good
tips
you
understand
rand
took
over
gresham
did
retain
me
merely
to
help
him
clear
himself
i
do
accept
that
kind
of
retainers
i
was
retained
to
find
the
murderer
of
arnold
rivers
and
i
intend
to
continue
working
on
this
case
until
i
do
i
hope
that
the
same
friendly
spirit
of
mutual
cooperation
will
exist
between
your
office
and
my
agency
as
exists
between
me
and
the
state
police
i
certainly
do
want
to
have
to
work
at
cross
purposes
with
any
of
the
regular
agencies
oh
certainly
of
course
farnsworth
did
seem
to
like
the
idea
but
there
was
no
apparent
opening
for
objection
he
and
rand
exchanged
mendacious
compliments
pledged
close
cooperation
and
did
practically
everything
but
draw
up
and
sign
a
treaty
of
alliance
then
farnsworth
and
corporal
kavaalen
accompanied
rand
and
pierre
jarrett
to
the
front
door
some
of
the
reporters
who
were
ravening
outside
must
have
spotted
rand
as
he
had
entered
they
were
all
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
and
set
up
a
monstrous
ululation
when
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
farnsworth
beaming
approval
rand
assured
the
press
that
he
was
no
more
than
a
mere
spectator
that
the
state
police
and
the
efficient
district
attorney
of
scott
county
had
the
situation
well
in
hand
and
that
an
arrest
was
expected
within
a
matter
of
hours
then
he
and
pierre
hurried
to
his
car
and
drove
away
chapter
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
moment
or
two
then
after
they
had
left
the
uproar
at
the
rivers
place
behind
and
were
approaching
the
village
of
rosemont
pierre
turned
to
rand
you
know
he
said
for
a
disciple
of
korzybski
you
came
pretty
close
to
confusing
orders
of
abstraction
a
couple
of
times
back
there
you
showed
that
stephen
was
at
home
while
rivers
was
taking
that
phone
call
a
little
after
ten
but
when
you
talk
about
clearing
him
completely
are
you
overlooking
the
possibility
that
he
came
back
to
after
you
and
philip
cabot
left
the
gresham
place
rand
eased
the
on
the
gas
and
spared
young
jarrett
a
before
returning
his
attention
to
the
road
ahead
understand
pierre
hastened
to
add
i
do
believe
that
stephen
was
fool
enough
to
kill
rivers
over
that
fake
north
cheney
but
were
you
producing
inferences
that
had
been
abstracted
from
any
descriptive
data
pierre
when
i
working
on
a
case
like
this
any
resemblance
between
my
opinions
and
the
statements
i
may
make
is
purely
due
to
conscious
considerations
of
policy
rand
told
him
i
do
want
farnsworth
or
mick
mckenna
going
around
bitching
this
operation
up
for
me
if
they
feel
justified
in
eliminating
gresham
on
the
strength
of
that
phone
call
i
satisfied
regardless
of
the
semantics
involved
right
now
the
thing
that
worrying
me
is
the
ease
with
which
i
seem
to
have
talked
farnsworth
into
laying
off
gresham
he
and
olsen
both
have
minds
they
may
just
dismiss
that
telephone
alibi
such
as
it
is
as
mere
error
of
the
mortal
mind
and
go
right
ahead
building
some
kind
of
a
ramshackle
case
against
gresham
since
they
picked
him
for
their
entry
they
wo
want
to
have
to
scratch
him
damn
i
wish
i
could
think
of
where
walters
could
have
sold
those
pistols
well
if
rivers
was
involved
somehow
why
was
he
killed
pierre
wondered
hey
maybe
walters
sold
the
pistols
to
umholtz
he
just
as
big
a
crook
as
rivers
was
only
not
quite
so
smart
rand
nodded
thoughtfully
maybe
so
and
suppose
rivers
found
out
about
it
and
tried
to
declare
himself
in
on
it
that
stuff
would
be
worth
at
least
ten
thousand
i
doubt
if
whoever
bought
it
paid
walters
more
than
two
in
the
income
bracket
the
difference
might
be
worth
killing
for
that
right
and
umholtz
was
in
the
infantry
in
the
other
war
he
served
in
the
division
he
was
trained
to
use
a
bayonet
and
he
pick
that
short
mauser
it
has
about
the
same
weight
and
balance
as
a
springfield
well
you
know
the
killer
would
need
to
have
been
trained
to
use
a
bayonet
rand
pointed
out
mick
mckenna
made
that
point
this
afternoon
there
have
been
a
lot
of
that
showed
bayonet
fighting
pretty
nearly
everybody
knows
about
the
technique
that
was
used
and
against
an
unarmed
and
probably
unsuspecting
victim
like
rivers
a
great
deal
of
proficiency
would
be
needed
he
slowed
the
car
up
this
road
he
asked
yes
that
my
place
over
there
pierre
pointed
to
a
house
that
lay
against
a
hillside
about
a
mile
ahead
making
a
vivid
spot
in
the
dull
grays
and
greens
of
the
early
april
landscape
it
consisted
of
a
square
block
with
wings
projecting
to
give
it
an
floorplan
it
reminded
rand
of
farmhouses
he
had
seen
in
sicily
during
the
war
come
on
in
and
see
my
stuff
if
you
have
time
pierre
invited
as
rand
pulled
to
a
stop
in
the
driveway
i
think
i
told
you
what
i
collect
personal
combat
arms
both
firearms
and
they
entered
the
front
door
which
opened
directly
into
a
large
parlor
a
brightly
colored
cheerful
room
a
woman
rose
from
a
chair
where
she
had
been
reading
she
was
somewhere
between
and
fifty
but
her
figure
was
still
trim
and
she
retained
much
of
what
in
her
youth
must
have
been
great
beauty
mother
this
is
colonel
rand
pierre
said
jeff
my
mother
rand
shook
hands
with
her
and
said
something
polite
she
gave
him
a
smile
of
real
pleasure
pierre
has
been
telling
me
about
you
colonel
she
said
there
was
a
faint
trace
of
french
accent
in
her
voice
i
suppose
he
brought
you
here
to
show
you
his
treasures
yes
i
collect
arms
too
pistols
rand
said
she
laughed
you
you
like
women
looking
at
new
hat
will
you
stay
for
dinner
with
us
colonel
rand
why
i
sorry
i
ca
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
and
expected
for
dinner
at
the
flemings
i
really
wish
i
could
jarrett
maybe
some
other
time
they
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
then
pierre
guided
rand
into
one
of
the
wings
of
the
house
this
is
my
workshop
too
he
said
here
where
i
do
my
writing
he
opened
a
door
and
showed
rand
into
a
large
room
on
one
side
the
wall
was
blank
on
the
other
it
was
pierced
by
two
small
casement
windows
the
far
end
was
of
windows
for
its
entire
width
from
within
three
feet
of
the
floor
almost
to
the
ceiling
there
were
bookcases
on
either
long
side
and
on
the
rear
end
and
over
them
hung
pierre
weapons
rand
went
slowly
around
the
room
taking
everything
in
very
few
of
the
arms
were
of
issue
military
type
and
most
of
these
showed
alterations
to
suit
individual
requirements
as
pierre
had
told
him
the
evening
before
the
emphasis
was
upon
weapons
which
illustrated
techniques
of
combat
at
the
end
of
the
room
lighted
by
the
wide
windows
was
a
long
desk
which
was
really
a
writer
assembly
line
with
typewriter
stacks
of
notes
and
manuscripts
and
a
big
dictionary
on
a
stand
beside
a
comfortable
what
are
you
writing
rand
asked
i
do
a
lot
of
stories
for
the
pulps
pierre
told
him
and
and
mags
like
that
most
of
it
standardized
what
known
to
the
trade
as
my
best
stuff
goes
to
parenthetically
you
must
judge
any
of
these
magazines
by
their
names
it
seems
to
be
a
convention
to
use
hyperbolic
names
for
magazines
a
heritage
from
what
might
be
called
an
earlier
and
ruder
day
what
i
do
for
is
really
hard
work
and
i
enjoy
it
i
working
now
on
one
for
them
based
on
dunne
if
you
know
what
they
are
i
think
so
rand
said
polydimensional
time
is
it
based
on
an
effect
dunne
observed
and
described
dreams
obviously
related
to
some
waking
event
but
preceding
rather
than
following
the
event
to
which
they
are
related
i
read
dunne
with
some
years
before
the
war
and
once
when
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
recorded
dreams
for
about
a
month
i
got
a
few
examples
and
two
unmistakable
dreams
i
never
got
anything
that
would
help
me
pick
a
or
spot
a
rise
in
the
stock
market
though
well
you
know
there
a
case
on
record
of
a
man
who
had
a
dream
of
hearing
a
radio
narration
of
the
english
derby
of
including
the
announcement
that
hyperion
had
won
which
he
did
pierre
said
the
dream
was
six
hours
before
the
race
and
tallied
very
closely
with
the
phraseology
used
by
the
radio
narrator
here
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
tyrrell
and
psychical
and
leafed
through
it
did
this
fellow
cash
in
on
it
rand
asked
no
he
was
a
quaker
and
violently
opposed
to
betting
here
he
handed
the
book
to
rand
case
twelve
rand
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
read
the
section
indicated
about
three
pages
in
length
well
i
be
damned
he
said
as
he
finished
the
idea
of
anybody
passing
up
a
chance
like
that
to
enrich
himself
literally
smote
him
to
the
vitals
i
see
the
british
society
for
psychical
research
checked
that
case
and
got
verification
from
a
couple
of
independent
witnesses
if
the
vouches
for
a
story
it
must
be
the
mccoy
they
the
gang
of
confirmed
skeptics
anywhere
in
christendom
they
take
an
attitude
toward
evidence
that
might
be
advantageously
copied
by
most
of
the
district
attorneys
i
met
the
one
in
this
county
being
no
exception
what
this
story
you
working
on
oh
it
based
on
dunne
precognition
theories
plus
a
few
ideas
of
my
own
plus
a
theory
of
alternate
lines
of
for
alternate
probabilities
pierre
said
see
here
the
situation
half
an
hour
later
they
were
still
arguing
about
a
multidimensional
universe
when
rand
remembered
dave
ritter
who
should
be
at
the
rosemont
inn
by
now
he
looked
at
his
watch
saw
that
it
was
five
and
inquired
about
a
telephone
yes
of
course
out
here
pierre
took
him
back
to
the
parlor
where
he
dialed
the
inn
and
inquired
if
a
ritter
from
new
belfast
were
registered
there
yet
he
was
a
moment
later
he
was
speaking
to
ritter
jeff
for
gawdsake
do
come
here
ritter
advised
this
place
is
with
reporters
the
bar
sounds
like
the
second
act
of
front
tony
ashe
and
steve
drake
from
the
and
harry
bentz
from
the
joe
rawlings
the
ap
man
from
louisburg
christ
only
knows
who
all
this
damn
thing
going
to
turn
into
another
case
look
meet
me
at
that
beer
joint
about
two
miles
on
the
new
belfast
side
of
rosemont
on
route
the
place
with
the
big
pabst
sign
out
in
front
i
try
to
get
there
without
letting
a
couple
of
reporters
hide
in
the
okay
see
you
directly
rand
hung
up
spent
the
next
few
minutes
breaking
away
from
pierre
and
his
mother
and
went
out
to
his
car
trust
dave
ritter
he
thought
to
pick
some
place
where
malt
beverages
were
sold
for
a
rendezvous
dave
coupé
was
parked
inconspicuously
beside
the
roadhouse
opening
his
rand
took
out
the
two
percussion
revolvers
and
shoved
them
under
his
trench
coat
one
on
either
side
pulling
up
the
belt
to
hold
them
in
place
as
he
went
into
the
roadhouse
he
felt
like
damon
runyon
tweeney
he
found
ritter
in
the
last
booth
engaged
in
finishing
a
bottle
of
beer
rand
ordered
bourbon
and
plain
water
and
ritter
ordered
another
beer
i
have
the
stuff
tip
left
with
kathie
ritter
said
taking
out
a
couple
of
closely
typed
sheets
and
handing
them
across
the
table
he
said
this
was
the
whole
business
rand
glanced
over
them
tipton
had
neatly
and
concisely
summarized
the
provisions
of
lane
fleming
will
and
had
also
listed
all
fleming
life
insurance
policies
with
beneficiaries
including
a
partnership
policy
on
the
lives
of
fleming
dunmore
and
anton
varcek
paying
each
of
the
survivors
i
see
gladys
and
geraldine
and
nelda
each
get
a
third
of
premix
stock
rand
commented
but
before
they
can
have
the
certificates
transferred
to
them
they
have
to
sign
over
their
to
the
board
of
directors
evidently
fleming
did
approve
of
the
feminine
touch
in
business
yeah
is
that
a
dandy
ritter
asked
the
directors
are
elected
by
majority
vote
of
the
stockholders
they
now
have
the
of
a
majority
of
the
stock
that
makes
the
present
board
and
responsible
only
to
each
other
so
it
does
but
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
according
to
tip
the
board
is
one
hundred
per
cent
in
favor
of
the
merger
with
national
milling
packaging
we
have
to
suppose
fleming
knew
that
there
must
have
been
considerable
intramural
acrimony
on
the
subject
while
he
was
still
alive
now
since
he
opposed
the
merger
if
he
had
intended
committing
suicide
he
would
have
made
some
other
arrangement
he
at
least
one
would
suppose
so
well
then
rand
asked
why
since
he
is
so
worried
about
these
suicide
rumors
does
goode
use
the
one
argument
which
would
utterly
disprove
them
or
is
there
some
reason
why
he
does
want
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
fleming
death
is
what
makes
the
merger
possible
well
that
would
be
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
merger
made
fleming
death
necessary
ritter
pointed
out
he
poured
more
beer
into
his
glass
while
we
on
it
what
the
angle
on
this
butler
livery
i
was
supposed
to
bring
i
brought
my
tux
and
i
borrowed
a
striped
vest
from
the
theatrical
property
exchange
and
i
brought
that
dago
of
yours
but
what
makes
you
think
the
flemings
are
going
to
be
needing
a
new
butler
you
going
to
poison
the
one
they
have
the
one
they
have
has
been
exceeding
his
duties
rand
said
he
was
supposed
to
clean
the
not
content
with
that
been
cleaning
it
out
i
know
it
was
the
butler
he
went
at
length
into
his
reasons
for
thinking
so
and
described
the
of
the
thefts
now
all
this
is
just
theory
so
far
but
when
i
able
to
prove
it
i
going
to
put
the
arm
on
this
walters
if
it
right
in
the
middle
of
dinner
and
he
only
has
the
roast
half
served
and
i
want
you
ready
to
step
into
the
vacancy
thus
created
i
going
to
be
busy
as
a
pup
in
a
fireplug
factory
with
this
rivers
thing
and
i
need
some
done
inside
the
fleming
household
he
went
on
in
meticulous
detail
to
explain
about
the
rivers
murder
i
have
some
work
for
you
before
you
ready
to
start
buttling
too
disencumbering
himself
of
the
two
percussion
revolvers
he
laid
them
on
the
table
i
want
you
to
take
these
and
show
them
to
this
barbecue
man
get
from
him
a
positive
statement
preferably
in
writing
as
to
which
if
either
he
sold
to
lane
fleming
you
might
show
your
agency
card
and
claim
to
be
checking
up
on
some
stolen
pistols
that
have
been
recovered
then
if
he
identifies
the
leech
rigdon
take
the
colt
and
show
it
to
elmer
umholtz
you
want
to
be
careful
how
you
handle
him
we
may
want
him
for
puncturing
rivers
though
i
inclined
to
doubt
that
as
of
now
get
him
to
tell
you
yes
or
no
whether
he
reblued
it
and
replated
the
and
and
if
he
did
it
for
rivers
and
if
so
when
i
know
that
been
done
the
bluing
is
too
dark
for
a
civil
war
period
job
the
frame
which
ought
to
be
in
colors
has
been
blued
like
the
barrel
and
cylinder
the
is
almost
obliterated
and
you
can
see
a
few
that
have
been
blued
over
but
i
want
to
know
if
this
gun
was
ever
in
rivers
shop
that
the
important
thing
got
the
addresses
rand
furnished
them
and
ritter
noted
them
down
the
waitress
wandered
back
to
see
if
they
wanted
anything
else
she
gave
a
small
squeak
of
surprise
when
she
saw
the
two
big
on
the
table
rand
and
ritter
repeated
their
orders
and
when
she
brought
back
the
drinks
the
colt
and
the
leech
rigdon
were
out
of
sight
the
way
i
see
it
everybody
who
within
a
of
this
rivers
killing
is
trying
to
pin
the
medal
on
somebody
else
ritter
was
saying
the
lawrence
girl
was
afraid
young
jarrett
had
done
it
right
away
she
sicced
you
onto
gillis
gillis
did
lose
any
time
putting
mckenna
and
farnsworth
onto
gresham
gresham
the
only
one
who
did
have
a
patsy
ready
you
supposed
to
dig
one
up
for
him
and
jarrett
the
first
chance
he
gets
introduces
umholtz
he
stared
into
his
beer
as
though
he
thought
ultimate
verity
might
be
lurking
somewhere
under
the
suds
do
you
think
it
might
be
possible
that
rivers
bumped
fleming
off
in
spite
of
his
getting
killed
later
he
asked
anything
possible
rand
replied
except
where
some
structural
contradiction
is
involved
like
scoring
thirteen
with
one
throw
of
a
pair
of
dice
yes
he
could
have
the
way
the
flemings
leave
their
garage
open
as
long
as
any
of
the
cars
are
out
anybody
could
have
sneaked
into
the
house
from
the
garage
and
gone
up
from
the
library
to
the
gunroom
the
only
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
rivers
would
have
known
about
that
that
lawsuit
and
criminal
action
that
fleming
was
going
to
start
and
that
been
verified
from
sources
independent
of
goode
was
a
good
sound
motive
and
say
he
took
the
leech
rigdon
away
after
leaving
the
colt
in
fleming
hand
selling
it
to
some
collector
who
put
it
in
with
a
hundred
or
so
other
pistols
would
be
a
good
way
of
disposing
of
it
and
i
can
understand
his
trying
to
buy
the
colt
to
get
it
out
of
circulation
rand
sipped
his
bourbon
but
that
leaves
us
with
the
question
of
who
killed
rivers
and
why
well
because
fleming
is
dead
and
it
does
matter
whether
he
was
murdered
or
died
of
old
age
walters
starts
robbing
the
collection
he
sells
the
pistols
to
rivers
ritter
reconstructed
and
as
rivers
does
want
them
around
his
shop
till
they
had
time
to
cool
off
he
stores
them
with
this
umholtz
character
who
seems
to
have
been
in
plenty
of
crooked
deals
with
rivers
in
the
past
the
pistols
are
worth
about
ten
grand
and
nobody
knows
where
they
are
but
rivers
and
umholtz
and
if
rivers
drops
dead
all
of
a
sudden
nobody
will
know
where
they
are
except
umholtz
and
in
a
couple
of
years
he
can
get
them
sold
off
and
have
the
money
all
to
himself
yes
dave
that
good
sound
murder
too
and
rivers
would
sit
down
and
drink
with
umholtz
and
umholtz
could
take
that
mauser
out
of
the
rack
right
in
front
of
rivers
and
rivers
would
suspect
a
thing
till
it
was
too
late
of
course
it
depends
upon
two
unverified
assumptions
one
that
the
pistols
were
sold
to
rivers
and
two
that
rivers
stored
them
with
umholtz
and
three
that
walters
stole
the
pistols
in
the
first
place
ritter
added
you
know
it
possible
that
somebody
else
in
that
house
might
have
stolen
them
yes
as
i
said
anything
possible
within
structural
limits
but
possibilities
exist
on
different
orders
of
probability
we
ca
try
to
consider
all
the
possibilities
in
any
case
because
they
are
indefinitely
numerous
the
best
we
can
do
is
screen
out
all
the
probabilities
list
the
probabilities
and
revise
our
list
when
and
as
new
data
comes
to
light
well
i
told
you
why
i
think
walters
is
a
good
suspect
from
what
i
seen
of
that
household
i
think
walters
was
personally
loyal
to
lane
fleming
and
i
do
believe
he
feels
any
loyalty
to
anybody
else
there
with
the
exception
of
gladys
fleming
he
might
keep
quiet
about
the
missing
pistols
if
she
were
the
thief
if
dunmore
or
varcek
or
either
of
the
girls
had
done
the
stealing
he
tell
gladys
and
she
pass
it
on
to
me
she
would
be
glad
of
anything
that
could
be
used
against
any
of
the
others
and
if
on
the
other
hand
she
had
stolen
the
pistols
herself
she
would
have
wanted
me
poking
around
and
would
have
brought
me
in
at
least
not
to
handle
the
collection
rand
looked
regretfully
at
his
empty
glass
and
decided
against
ordering
another
dave
i
just
thought
of
something
he
said
how
do
you
think
this
would
work
he
told
ritter
what
he
had
thought
of
ritter
drank
beer
slowly
and
meditatively
it
just
might
work
he
considered
i
seen
that
gag
work
a
hundred
times
hell
i
used
something
like
that
myself
at
least
fifty
times
and
so
have
you
and
i
do
think
walters
would
be
familiar
enough
with
to
see
what
you
were
doing
but
if
it
turns
out
that
walters
did
sell
the
pistols
to
rivers
at
all
what
then
well
if
he
sold
them
to
umholtz
pierre
jarrett
theory
is
still
valid
until
disproved
rand
said
and
if
he
did
sell
them
either
to
rivers
or
umholtz
we
have
to
conclude
that
rivers
and
fleming
were
killed
by
the
same
person
the
rivers
killing
being
a
security
measure
that
is
unless
we
find
that
rivers
was
killed
by
pierre
jarrett
which
is
a
sort
of
probability
jarrett
and
the
girl
left
early
enough
for
him
to
have
killed
rivers
they
were
both
pretty
hard
hit
by
that
blockbuster
rivers
had
dropped
on
them
give
me
back
that
colt
dave
all
you
have
to
do
is
get
an
identification
on
the
leech
rigdon
from
the
barbecue
man
i
going
to
let
mick
mckenna
handle
umholtz
one
way
or
another
after
concluded
the
walters
experiment
until
then
we
do
want
to
stir
umholtz
up
at
all
chapter
parking
in
the
drive
rand
entered
the
fleming
house
by
the
front
door
the
butler
must
have
been
busy
with
his
tasks
in
the
rear
it
was
gladys
herself
who
admitted
him
stay
out
of
there
she
warned
him
taking
his
arm
and
guiding
him
away
from
the
parlor
doorway
nelda
and
geraldine
are
in
there
ignoring
each
other
if
you
go
in
they
start
talking
to
you
and
then
they
start
talking
at
each
other
through
you
and
the
air
will
be
full
of
tomahawks
in
a
jiffy
let
go
up
in
the
gunroom
that
out
of
the
battle
zone
what
started
the
hostilities
this
time
rand
asked
going
up
the
stairway
with
her
oh
geraldine
lost
nelda
out
of
the
kinsey
report
or
something
she
shrugged
mainly
reaction
to
rivers
death
that
was
a
great
blow
to
all
of
us
thousand
dollars
worth
of
blow
it
was
a
blow
to
me
too
but
i
not
letting
it
throw
me
what
were
you
doing
all
afternoon
trying
to
keep
the
rest
of
our
prospects
out
of
jail
this
district
attorney
you
have
in
this
county
had
the
idea
he
could
charge
stephen
gresham
with
the
killing
i
had
a
time
talking
him
out
of
it
and
i
still
not
sure
how
far
i
succeeded
and
i
was
trying
to
get
a
line
on
where
those
pistols
got
to
ssssh
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
rand
saw
walters
approaching
down
the
hall
it
was
colonel
rand
walters
i
let
him
in
myself
are
varcek
and
dunmore
here
yet
dunmore
is
in
the
library
and
varcek
is
upstairs
in
his
laboratory
dinner
will
be
ready
in
of
an
hour
have
you
mixed
the
cocktails
you
better
do
that
serve
them
in
about
twenty
minutes
and
you
better
go
up
and
warn
varcek
not
to
become
involved
in
anything
messy
before
dinner
walters
her
and
started
toward
the
attic
stairway
rand
and
gladys
went
into
the
gunroom
rand
turned
to
the
left
picked
a
pistol
from
the
wall
and
carried
it
with
him
as
he
guided
gladys
toward
the
desk
in
the
corner
you
think
walters
stole
them
she
asked
so
far
i
inclined
to
have
you
told
any
of
the
others
yet
oh
lord
no
they
all
be
sure
that
i
stole
them
myself
i
counting
on
you
to
get
them
back
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
do
you
think
that
was
why
rivers
was
killed
after
all
when
a
lot
of
valuable
pistols
disappear
and
a
crooked
dealer
is
murdered
i
expect
there
to
be
a
connection
there
could
be
did
you
ever
hear
any
stories
about
rivers
and
this
young
fellow
gillis
who
works
in
rivers
shop
gladys
laughed
is
that
rearing
its
ugly
head
in
public
now
she
asked
well
there
nothing
like
a
good
murder
to
shake
the
skeletons
out
of
the
closets
not
that
this
particular
skeleton
was
ever
exactly
hidden
the
stories
are
numerous
and
somewhat
repetitious
cecil
and
rivers
would
be
seen
together
at
roadhouses
and
so
on
at
what
they
imagined
was
a
safe
distance
from
rosemont
and
it
was
said
that
when
rivers
was
away
over
night
cecil
was
never
seen
to
leave
the
rivers
place
in
the
evenings
might
this
be
relevant
to
rivers
sudden
demise
it
could
be
rand
was
keeping
one
eye
on
the
hall
door
and
the
other
on
the
head
of
the
spiral
stairway
do
mention
outside
what
i
told
you
about
farnsworth
having
this
brainstorm
about
stephen
gresham
if
it
got
out
it
might
hurt
gresham
professionally
the
fact
is
gresham
has
just
retained
me
to
investigate
the
rivers
murder
for
him
that
interfere
to
any
great
extent
with
the
work
i
doing
here
if
necessary
i
bring
a
couple
of
my
men
in
from
new
belfast
to
help
me
on
the
rivers
operation
he
broke
off
abruptly
catching
a
movement
at
the
head
of
the
spiral
and
lifted
the
pistol
in
his
hand
as
though
showing
it
to
gladys
see
he
went
on
it
has
two
hammers
and
two
nipples
but
only
one
barrel
it
was
loaded
with
two
charges
one
on
top
of
the
other
the
bullet
of
the
rear
charge
acted
as
the
for
the
front
charge
oh
walters
he
affected
to
catch
sight
of
the
butler
for
the
first
time
bring
me
that
walch
revolver
will
you
yes
sir
walters
crossing
the
room
veered
to
the
right
and
went
to
the
middle
wall
bringing
a
revolver
over
to
the
desk
it
was
a
percussion
weapon
with
an
abnormally
long
cylinder
the
cocktails
are
served
he
announced
we
be
down
in
a
moment
you
can
put
these
back
where
they
belong
when
you
find
time
rand
told
him
now
here
he
said
to
gladys
this
is
the
same
idea
in
a
revolver
six
chambers
two
charges
in
each
in
theory
it
was
a
good
idea
but
in
actual
practice
walters
went
out
the
hall
door
presumably
to
call
varcek
rand
continued
talking
about
the
principle
as
used
in
the
lindsay
pistol
and
the
walch
revolver
until
he
was
sure
the
butler
was
out
of
hearing
gladys
was
looking
at
him
in
appreciative
if
slightly
delight
i
wondered
why
you
brought
that
thing
over
here
with
you
she
said
brother
was
that
a
quick
shift
you
really
sure
he
the
one
i
not
really
sure
of
anything
except
of
my
own
existence
and
eventual
extinction
rand
told
her
it
pretty
nearly
has
to
be
somebody
inside
this
house
i
do
think
anybody
else
here
yourself
included
would
know
enough
about
arms
to
rob
this
collection
as
selectively
as
it
has
been
robbed
did
you
see
what
just
happened
here
i
asked
him
for
one
of
the
most
uncommon
arms
here
and
he
went
straight
and
got
it
he
knows
this
collection
as
well
as
your
husband
did
and
i
assume
he
knows
values
almost
as
well
and
of
course
there
was
a
musket
too
fleming
did
collect
or
he
have
had
one
it
embodied
the
same
principle
as
the
pistol
the
legend
is
that
this
man
lindsay
brother
was
a
soldier
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
killed
by
indians
who
drew
the
fire
of
the
detail
he
was
with
and
then
charged
them
when
their
muskets
were
empty
rand
shrugged
actually
the
principle
is
ancient
there
a
wheel
lock
pistol
in
the
metropolitan
museum
in
new
york
firing
two
shots
from
the
same
barrel
varcek
and
the
butler
who
had
entered
by
the
hall
door
went
across
the
gunroom
and
down
the
spiral
rand
laid
down
the
pistol
and
escorted
gladys
after
them
dunmore
and
geraldine
were
in
the
library
when
they
went
down
geraldine
mildly
potted
was
reclining
in
a
chair
sipping
her
drink
dunmore
was
still
radiating
his
synthetic
cheerfulness
get
many
of
the
pistols
listed
colonel
he
hailed
rand
with
jovial
condescension
no
rand
poured
two
cocktails
handing
one
to
gladys
i
went
to
arnold
rivers
place
this
morning
on
a
little
unfinished
business
and
damn
near
tripped
over
rivers
corpse
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
getting
myself
disinvolved
from
the
ensuing
uproar
he
told
dunmore
you
heard
about
it
of
course
yes
of
course
horrible
business
i
hope
you
did
get
mixed
up
in
it
any
more
than
you
had
to
after
all
you
working
for
us
and
if
the
police
knew
that
we
be
bothered
too
look
here
you
do
think
some
of
these
other
people
who
were
after
the
collection
might
have
killed
rivers
to
keep
him
from
outbidding
them
nelda
entering
from
the
hallway
caught
the
last
part
of
that
good
god
fred
she
shrieked
at
him
do
say
things
like
that
maybe
they
did
but
wait
till
they
bought
the
collection
and
paid
for
it
before
you
start
accusing
them
i
not
accusing
anybody
dunmore
growled
back
at
her
i
do
know
enough
about
it
to
make
any
accusations
all
i
saying
is
well
do
say
it
then
if
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
his
wife
retorted
in
spite
of
this
start
dinner
passed
in
relative
quiet
for
the
most
part
they
talked
about
the
remaining
chances
of
selling
the
collection
about
which
nobody
was
optimistic
rand
tried
to
build
up
morale
with
pictures
of
large
museums
and
important
dealers
all
fairly
slavering
to
get
their
fangs
into
the
fleming
collection
but
to
little
avail
a
pall
of
gloom
had
settled
and
he
was
forced
to
concede
that
he
had
at
last
found
somebody
who
had
a
valid
reason
to
mourn
the
sudden
and
violent
end
of
arnold
rivers
dinner
finished
he
went
up
to
the
gunroom
and
began
compiling
his
list
he
found
a
yardstick
and
thumbtacked
it
to
the
edge
of
the
desk
to
get
and
barrel
lengths
and
used
a
pair
of
inside
calipers
and
a
rule
from
the
workbench
to
get
calibers
sticking
a
sheet
of
paper
into
the
portable
he
began
on
the
wheel
locks
leaving
spaces
to
insert
the
description
of
the
stolen
pistols
when
recovered
when
he
had
finished
the
wheel
locks
he
began
on
the
snaphaunces
then
did
the
he
had
begun
on
the
true
flintlocks
when
walters
who
had
finished
his
own
dinner
came
up
to
help
him
rand
put
the
butler
to
work
fetching
pistols
from
the
racks
and
replacing
those
he
had
already
listed
after
a
while
dunmore
strolled
in
you
say
you
found
rivers
body
yourself
colonel
rand
he
asked
rand
nodded
finished
what
he
was
typing
and
looked
up
why
yes
there
were
a
few
details
i
wanted
to
clear
up
with
him
and
i
called
at
his
shop
this
morning
i
found
him
lying
dead
inside
he
went
on
to
describe
the
manner
in
which
rivers
had
met
his
death
the
radio
and
newspaper
accounts
were
accurate
enough
in
the
main
there
were
a
few
details
omitted
at
the
request
of
the
police
of
course
well
you
did
get
involved
in
it
though
dunmore
inquired
anxiously
i
mean
you
not
taking
any
part
in
the
investigation
after
all
we
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
anything
like
this
in
that
case
dunmore
let
me
advise
you
not
to
discuss
the
matter
of
rivers
offer
to
buy
this
collection
with
anybody
outside
rand
told
him
so
far
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
office
both
seem
to
think
that
rivers
was
killed
by
somebody
whom
he
swindled
in
a
business
deal
of
course
they
know
about
the
collection
being
for
sale
and
rivers
offering
to
buy
it
they
do
dunmore
asked
sharply
did
you
tell
them
that
naturally
i
had
to
account
for
my
presence
at
rivers
shop
this
morning
rand
replied
i
do
know
if
the
idea
has
occurred
to
them
that
somebody
might
have
killed
rivers
to
eliminate
a
rival
bidder
for
the
collection
or
not
i
would
say
anything
if
i
were
you
that
might
give
them
the
idea
the
extension
phone
rang
shrilly
walters
picked
it
up
spoke
into
it
and
listened
for
a
moment
yes
miss
lawrence
he
right
here
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
he
handed
the
phone
across
the
desk
to
rand
miss
karen
lawrence
for
you
colonel
rand
rand
took
the
phone
before
he
had
time
to
say
hello
the
girl
demanded
of
him
colonel
rand
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
did
you
have
anything
to
do
with
pierre
jarrett
being
arrested
rand
barked
then
he
softened
his
voice
no
on
my
honor
miss
lawrence
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
this
moment
who
did
it
olsen
i
do
know
what
his
name
was
he
was
a
state
police
sergeant
she
replied
he
and
another
state
policeman
came
to
the
jarrett
house
about
half
an
hour
ago
charged
pierre
with
the
murder
of
arnold
rivers
and
took
him
away
his
mother
phoned
me
about
it
a
few
minutes
ago
that
jesuitical
bastard
rand
exploded
where
are
you
now
here
at
my
shop
jarrett
is
coming
here
she
afraid
the
reporters
will
be
coming
out
to
the
house
as
soon
as
they
hear
about
it
and
she
does
want
to
talk
to
them
all
right
i
be
there
as
soon
as
i
can
if
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
you
can
count
on
me
for
it
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
walters
is
my
car
still
out
front
he
asked
it
is
good
i
be
gone
for
a
while
tell
the
others
i
have
something
to
attend
to
what
happened
now
dunmore
asked
sourly
just
what
i
was
speaking
about
the
gestapo
gathered
up
pierre
jarrett
they
seem
to
have
gotten
the
idea
now
that
the
motive
may
have
been
competition
for
the
collection
next
thing
farnsworth
will
think
he
has
a
case
against
carl
gwinnett
and
he
land
in
the
jug
too
i
hope
you
realize
that
every
time
something
like
this
happens
it
peels
a
thousand
or
so
off
the
price
i
be
able
to
get
for
you
people
for
these
pistols
dunmore
did
try
to
ask
how
that
would
happen
for
which
rand
was
duly
thankful
he
accepted
the
statement
uncritically
walters
was
staring
at
rand
in
horror
saying
nothing
rand
picked
up
the
outside
phone
and
dialed
the
same
number
he
had
called
from
the
rivers
place
that
morning
is
sergeant
mckenna
about
he
is
fine
i
like
to
speak
to
him
oh
hello
mick
jeff
rand
mckenna
chuckled
out
of
the
receiver
sort
of
slipped
one
over
on
you
did
i
he
gloated
why
i
was
checking
up
on
those
people
who
were
at
gresham
last
evening
and
they
all
agreed
that
young
jarrett
and
the
lawrence
girl
had
left
the
party
about
ten
so
i
had
a
talk
with
miss
lawrence
and
she
tried
to
tell
me
that
jarrett
was
with
her
at
her
apartment
over
the
antique
shop
from
about
ten
fifteen
until
about
twelve
when
another
girl
she
rooms
with
got
home
from
a
date
i
of
took
that
too
only
right
across
the
street
from
the
antique
shop
there
is
one
of
these
old
hens
like
you
find
in
every
neighborhood
the
kind
that
keeps
their
nose
flattened
on
the
window
between
the
curtains
checking
up
on
the
neighbors
i
spotted
her
when
i
came
out
of
the
antique
shop
so
i
slipped
around
to
see
her
and
she
told
me
that
young
jarrett
went
into
the
apartment
with
the
girl
at
about
quarter
past
ten
stayed
inside
for
about
twenty
minutes
then
came
out
and
drove
away
she
says
jarrett
came
back
in
about
half
an
hour
and
stayed
till
this
girl
who
shares
the
lawrence
girl
apartment
a
miss
dupont
who
teaches
sixth
grade
at
thaddeus
stevens
school
got
home
about
twelve
so
there
you
are
dave
ritter
said
this
was
going
to
turn
into
another
case
well
now
you
have
your
pig
woman
rand
said
miss
lawrence
should
have
lied
to
you
mick
i
suppose
she
got
worried
when
you
started
asking
questions
and
there
nothing
like
a
good
murder
in
the
neighborhood
to
make
liars
out
of
people
and
damn
well
i
know
that
mckenna
agreed
but
that
is
all
it
seems
our
crew
spotted
jarrett
car
standing
in
drive
about
eleven
just
when
he
was
away
from
the
and
about
when
the
figures
rivers
was
getting
the
business
did
they
get
the
number
rand
asked
or
how
did
they
identify
the
car
oh
they
knew
it
see
our
boys
shoot
a
lot
with
the
scott
county
rifle
pistol
club
and
they
all
seen
jarrett
car
at
the
range
different
times
mckenna
said
a
gray
plymouth
coupé
like
i
say
they
knew
the
car
and
they
knew
jarrett
collects
guns
and
the
lights
were
on
inside
the
shop
and
the
shades
were
drawn
so
they
did
think
anything
of
it
at
the
time
see
they
went
to
bed
about
ten
this
morning
and
did
get
up
till
after
five
so
i
did
find
out
about
it
till
after
supper
rand
shrugged
and
managed
to
get
some
of
the
shrug
into
his
voice
can
be
at
that
he
said
i
hope
you
not
making
a
mistake
mick
if
you
are
his
lawyer
going
to
crucify
you
what
are
you
using
for
a
motive
rivers
was
outbidding
this
crowd
jarrett
and
the
girl
were
in
with
they
all
told
me
about
that
mckenna
said
and
he
and
the
girl
were
planning
to
use
their
end
of
the
collection
to
go
into
the
arms
business
after
they
got
married
rivers
got
in
the
way
mckenna
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
must
have
shrugged
too
after
all
for
about
four
years
they
been
training
jarrett
to
overcome
resistance
with
the
bayonet
so
he
did
just
that
maybe
so
you
find
out
anything
about
that
other
matter
i
was
interested
in
you
mean
the
pistols
we
went
over
rivers
place
with
a
comb
and
questioned
young
gillis
about
it
and
we
did
get
a
thing
you
sure
those
pistols
went
to
rivers
i
not
sure
of
anything
at
all
rand
replied
looking
at
his
watch
you
going
to
be
in
say
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
sure
i
be
around
all
evening
mckenna
assured
him
if
we
have
another
murder
rand
hung
up
he
pulled
the
sheet
out
of
the
typewriter
laid
it
face
down
on
the
other
sheets
he
had
finished
and
laid
a
long
flemish
flintlock
on
top
for
a
paperweight
memorizing
the
position
of
the
pistol
relative
to
the
paper
under
it
put
those
pistols
back
on
the
wall
he
told
walters
indicating
several
he
had
laid
aside
after
listing
leave
the
others
there
i
not
finished
with
them
yet
i
be
back
before
too
long
if
i
do
find
any
more
bodies
chapter
it
was
raining
again
as
rand
parked
his
car
about
a
hundred
yards
up
the
street
from
karen
lawrence
the
windows
were
dark
but
karen
was
waiting
inside
the
door
for
him
he
entered
quickly
mindful
of
the
eye
across
the
street
and
followed
her
to
a
back
room
where
jarrett
and
dorothy
gresham
were
all
three
women
regarded
him
intently
as
though
trying
to
decide
whether
he
was
friend
or
enemy
there
was
a
long
silence
before
jarrett
spoke
and
when
she
did
her
words
were
almost
the
same
as
karen
when
she
had
spoken
over
the
phone
colonel
rand
she
began
obviously
struggling
with
herself
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
did
you
have
anything
to
do
with
my
son
being
arrested
rand
shook
his
head
absolutely
nothing
jarrett
he
told
her
unbuckling
the
belt
of
his
raincoat
and
taking
it
off
i
have
never
seriously
suspected
your
son
of
the
rivers
murder
i
had
no
idea
that
mckenna
was
contemplating
arresting
him
and
if
i
had
i
would
have
advised
him
against
it
besides
causing
annoyance
to
innocent
people
mckenna
made
a
serious
tactical
error
he
was
misled
by
appearances
and
he
was
afraid
i
break
this
case
before
he
did
which
i
intend
to
do
he
turned
to
karen
lawrence
i
talked
to
mckenna
after
you
called
me
he
as
much
as
admitted
making
that
arrest
to
get
in
ahead
of
me
i
told
you
dorothy
gresham
flashed
at
the
others
i
knew
jeff
would
stoop
to
anything
as
contemptible
as
pretending
to
be
friend
and
then
getting
him
arrested
rand
permitted
himself
a
wry
inward
smile
he
hoped
she
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
observe
his
stooping
capabilities
before
he
had
finished
his
various
operations
at
rosemont
i
certainly
hoped
not
jarrett
relaxed
smiling
faintly
at
rand
pierre
likes
you
colonel
i
hated
the
thought
that
you
might
have
betrayed
him
are
you
working
on
the
rivers
case
too
rand
nodded
again
turning
to
dot
gresham
your
father
retained
me
to
make
an
investigation
he
said
after
that
trouble
he
had
with
rivers
about
that
spurious
north
cheney
he
wanted
the
murderer
caught
before
somebody
got
around
to
accusing
him
you
mean
there
a
chance
dad
might
be
suspected
dot
was
scared
rand
nodded
the
girl
was
beginning
to
look
suspiciously
at
karen
and
jarrett
getting
ready
to
toss
pierre
to
the
wolves
if
her
father
were
in
danger
rand
suspected
he
hastened
to
reassure
her
rivers
was
still
alive
when
your
father
reached
home
last
evening
he
told
her
that
been
established
she
breathed
her
obvious
relief
if
gresham
had
left
home
after
departure
with
philip
cabot
she
did
know
it
karen
on
the
other
hand
was
growing
more
and
more
worried
look
colonel
she
began
they
did
just
pull
pierre
name
out
of
a
hat
they
must
have
had
something
to
suspect
him
about
yes
you
should
have
lied
to
mckenna
he
checked
up
on
your
story
the
woman
across
the
street
told
him
about
seeing
pierre
leave
here
a
little
before
eleven
and
come
back
about
half
an
hour
later
i
was
afraid
of
that
karen
said
i
forgot
all
about
that
old
hag
there
nothing
that
can
go
on
around
here
that
she
does
know
about
pierre
calls
her
mrs
and
then
rand
continued
mckenna
claims
that
a
car
like
pierre
was
seen
parked
in
rivers
drive
about
the
time
pierre
was
away
from
here
jarrett
moaned
softly
her
face
already
haggard
became
positively
ghastly
karen
gasped
in
fright
they
only
identified
it
as
to
model
and
make
they
did
get
the
license
number
where
did
pierre
go
while
he
was
away
from
here
he
went
out
for
cigarettes
karen
said
when
we
came
here
from
greshams
we
made
some
coffee
and
then
sat
and
talked
for
a
while
and
then
we
found
out
that
we
were
both
out
of
cigarettes
and
there
any
here
so
pierre
said
he
go
out
and
get
some
he
was
gone
about
half
an
hour
when
he
came
back
he
had
a
carton
and
some
hot
pork
sandwiches
he
gotten
them
at
the
same
place
as
the
cigarettes
art
igoe
could
igoe
verify
that
it
would
help
if
he
did
igoe
place
is
a
drive
from
rivers
farther
down
the
road
has
pierre
a
lawyer
rand
asked
no
not
yet
we
were
just
talking
about
that
dad
would
defend
him
dot
suggested
of
course
he
not
a
criminal
lawyer
carter
tipton
in
new
belfast
rand
told
them
he
my
lawyer
gotten
me
out
of
more
jams
than
you
could
shake
a
stick
at
where
the
telephone
i
call
him
now
you
think
he
defend
pierre
unless
i
badly
mistaken
pierre
is
going
to
need
any
trial
defense
rand
told
them
he
will
need
somebody
to
look
after
his
interests
and
we
try
to
get
him
out
on
a
writ
as
soon
as
possible
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine
it
was
hard
to
say
where
carter
tipton
would
be
at
the
moment
his
manservant
would
probably
know
karen
showed
him
the
phone
and
he
started
to
put
through
a
call
it
was
eleven
before
he
backed
his
car
into
the
fleming
garage
and
the
rain
had
turned
to
a
wet
sticky
snow
all
the
fleming
cars
were
in
but
rand
left
the
garage
doors
open
he
also
left
his
hat
and
coat
in
the
car
after
locating
and
talking
to
tipton
and
arranging
for
him
to
meet
dave
ritter
at
the
rosemont
inn
he
had
gone
to
the
state
police
substation
where
he
had
talked
at
length
with
mick
mckenna
he
had
been
compelled
to
tell
the
state
police
sergeant
a
number
of
things
he
had
intended
keeping
to
himself
when
he
was
through
mckenna
went
so
far
as
to
admit
that
he
had
been
a
trifle
hasty
in
arresting
pierre
jarrett
rand
suspected
that
he
was
mentally
kicking
himself
with
hobnailed
boots
for
his
premature
act
he
also
submitted
for
mckenna
approval
the
scheme
he
had
outlined
to
dave
ritter
and
obtained
a
promise
of
cooperation
when
he
entered
the
fleming
library
en
route
to
the
gunroom
he
found
the
entire
family
assembled
there
with
them
was
humphrey
goode
as
he
came
in
they
broke
off
what
had
evidently
been
an
acrimonious
dispute
and
gave
him
their
undivided
attention
geraldine
relaxed
in
a
chair
was
smoking
for
once
she
did
have
a
glass
in
her
hand
gladys
occupied
another
chair
she
was
smoking
too
nelda
had
been
pacing
back
and
forth
like
a
caged
tiger
at
rand
entrance
she
turned
to
face
him
and
rand
wondered
whether
she
thought
he
was
clyde
beatty
or
a
side
of
beef
goode
and
dunmore
sat
together
on
the
sofa
forming
what
looked
like
a
bilateral
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
and
varcek
looking
more
than
ever
like
rudolf
hess
stood
with
folded
arms
in
one
corner
now
see
here
rand
dunmore
began
as
soon
as
the
detective
was
inside
the
room
we
want
to
know
just
exactly
for
whom
you
working
around
here
and
i
demand
to
know
where
you
been
since
you
left
here
this
evening
and
i
goode
piped
up
must
protest
most
strongly
against
your
involvement
in
this
local
murder
case
i
am
informed
that
while
in
the
employ
of
this
family
you
accepted
a
retainer
from
another
party
to
investigate
the
death
of
arnold
rivers
that
correct
rand
informed
him
then
he
turned
to
gladys
just
for
the
record
fleming
do
you
recall
any
stipulation
to
the
effect
that
the
business
of
handling
this
should
have
the
exclusive
attention
of
my
agency
i
certainly
do
recall
anything
of
the
sort
no
of
course
not
she
replied
as
long
as
the
collection
is
sold
to
the
best
advantage
i
have
any
interest
in
any
other
business
of
your
agency
and
have
no
right
to
have
she
turned
to
the
others
i
thought
i
made
that
clear
to
all
of
you
you
did
answer
my
question
dunmore
yelled
at
him
i
do
intend
to
you
are
my
client
and
i
not
answerable
to
you
well
you
carry
my
authorization
goode
supported
him
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
know
what
being
done
as
far
as
the
collection
concerned
yes
as
for
the
rivers
murder
or
my
service
or
any
other
business
of
the
agency
no
well
you
made
use
of
my
authorization
to
get
that
revolver
from
kirchner
goode
began
aah
rand
cried
so
that
concerns
the
rivers
murder
does
it
well
when
did
you
find
that
out
now
when
kirchner
called
you
you
had
no
objection
to
his
giving
me
that
revolver
what
changed
your
mind
for
you
did
you
know
that
rivers
was
dead
then
rand
watched
goode
trying
to
assimilate
that
or
did
you
think
i
knew
goode
cleared
his
throat
noisily
twisting
his
mouth
the
others
were
looking
back
and
forth
from
him
to
rand
in
obvious
bewilderment
they
realized
that
rand
had
pulled
some
kind
of
a
rabbit
out
of
a
hat
but
they
could
understand
how
he
done
it
what
i
mean
is
that
since
then
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
become
involved
in
this
murder
case
you
have
let
it
be
publicly
known
that
you
are
a
private
detective
working
for
the
fleming
family
goode
orated
how
long
then
will
it
be
before
it
will
be
said
by
all
sorts
of
irresponsible
persons
that
you
are
also
investigating
the
death
of
lane
fleming
well
rand
asked
patiently
are
you
afraid
people
will
start
calling
that
a
murder
too
gladys
was
looking
at
him
apprehensively
as
though
she
were
watching
him
juggle
four
live
hand
grenades
is
anybody
saying
that
now
varcek
asked
sharply
not
that
i
know
of
rand
lied
but
if
goode
keeps
on
denying
it
they
will
you
know
perfectly
well
goode
exploded
that
i
am
alluding
to
these
unfounded
and
mischievous
rumors
of
suicide
which
are
doing
the
premix
company
so
much
harm
my
god
rand
ca
you
realize
oh
come
off
it
goode
varcek
broke
in
amusedly
we
all
colonel
rand
included
know
that
you
started
those
rumors
yourself
very
clever
to
start
a
rumor
by
denying
it
but
scarcely
original
doctor
goebbels
was
doing
it
almost
twenty
years
ago
my
god
is
that
true
nelda
demanded
you
mean
he
been
going
around
starting
all
these
stories
about
father
committing
suicide
she
turned
on
goode
like
an
enraged
panther
why
you
lying
old
son
of
a
bitch
she
screamed
at
him
of
course
he
wants
to
start
a
selling
run
on
premix
varcek
explained
to
her
he
buying
every
share
he
can
get
his
hands
on
we
all
are
he
turned
to
rand
i
advise
you
to
buy
some
if
you
can
find
any
colonel
rand
in
a
month
or
so
it
going
to
be
a
really
good
thing
i
know
about
the
merger
i
am
buying
rand
told
him
but
are
you
sure
of
what
goode
been
doing
of
course
gladys
put
in
contemptuously
i
always
wondered
about
this
suicide
talk
i
could
see
why
humphrey
was
so
perturbed
about
it
anything
that
lowered
the
market
price
of
premix
at
this
time
would
be
to
his
advantage
she
looked
at
goode
as
though
he
had
six
legs
and
a
hard
shell
you
know
humphrey
i
ca
say
i
exactly
thank
you
for
this
did
you
know
about
it
nelda
demanded
of
her
husband
you
did
my
god
fred
you
are
a
filthy
specimen
oh
you
know
anything
to
turn
a
dishonest
dollar
geraldine
piped
up
like
the
late
arnold
rivers
offer
say
i
wonder
if
that
might
be
what
rivers
died
of
raising
the
price
and
leaving
fred
out
in
the
cold
dunmore
simply
stared
at
her
making
a
noise
like
a
chicken
choking
on
a
piece
of
string
well
all
this
is
my
pidgin
rand
said
to
gladys
i
only
work
here
and
i
still
have
some
work
to
do
with
that
he
walked
past
goode
and
dunmore
and
ascended
the
spiral
stairway
to
the
gunroom
even
at
the
desk
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
he
could
hear
them
going
at
it
in
the
library
sometimes
it
would
be
nelda
strident
shrieks
that
would
dominate
the
bedlam
below
sometimes
it
would
be
fred
dunmore
roaring
like
a
bull
now
and
then
humphrey
goode
would
rumble
something
and
once
in
a
while
he
could
hear
gladys
trained
and
modulated
voice
usually
any
remark
she
made
would
be
followed
by
outraged
shouts
from
goode
and
dunmore
like
the
crash
of
falling
masonry
after
the
of
a
at
first
rand
eavesdropped
shamelessly
but
there
was
nothing
of
more
than
comic
interest
it
was
just
a
routine
parade
and
of
the
older
and
more
dependable
family
skeletons
with
special
emphasis
on
humphrey
goode
business
and
professional
ethics
when
he
was
satisfied
that
he
would
hear
nothing
having
any
bearing
on
the
death
of
lane
fleming
rand
went
back
to
his
work
after
a
while
the
tumult
gradually
died
out
rand
was
still
typing
when
gladys
came
up
the
spiral
and
perched
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
picking
up
a
long
english
flintlock
and
hefting
it
you
know
i
sometimes
wonder
why
we
do
all
come
up
here
break
out
the
ammunition
pick
our
weapons
and
settle
things
she
said
it
never
was
like
this
when
lane
was
around
oh
nelda
and
geraldine
would
bare
their
teeth
at
each
other
once
in
a
while
but
now
this
place
has
turned
into
a
miniature
iwo
jima
i
do
know
how
much
longer
i
going
to
be
able
to
take
it
i
developing
combat
fatigue
it
snowing
rand
mentioned
let
throw
them
out
into
the
storm
i
ca
i
have
to
give
nelda
and
geraldine
a
home
as
long
as
they
live
she
replied
terms
of
the
will
oh
well
drink
herself
to
death
in
a
few
years
and
nelda
will
elope
with
a
sometime
why
do
you
have
the
house
haunted
the
agency
has
an
excellent
department
anything
you
want
poltergeists
apparitions
cold
clammy
hands
in
the
dark
footsteps
in
the
attic
clanking
chains
and
eldritch
screams
banshees
any
three
for
the
price
of
two
it
would
work
geraldine
is
so
used
to
dinosaurs
and
little
green
men
from
mars
that
she
would
mind
an
ordinary
ghost
and
nelda
probably
try
to
drag
it
into
bed
with
her
she
laid
down
the
pistol
and
slid
off
the
desk
well
pleasant
dreams
i
see
you
in
the
morning
after
she
had
left
the
gunroom
rand
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
a
very
precise
instrument
a
swiss
military
watch
with
a
sweep
second
hand
and
two
timing
dials
it
had
formerly
been
the
property
of
an
of
the
and
rand
had
appropriated
it
to
replace
his
own
broken
while
choking
the
to
death
in
an
alley
in
palermo
he
zeroed
the
timing
dials
and
pressed
the
then
he
stood
for
a
time
over
the
old
cobbler
bench
mentally
reconstructing
what
had
been
done
after
lane
fleming
had
been
shot
after
which
he
hurried
down
the
spiral
and
along
the
rear
hall
to
the
garage
where
he
snatched
his
hat
and
coat
from
the
car
he
threw
the
coat
over
his
shoulders
like
a
cloak
and
went
on
outside
he
made
his
way
across
the
lawn
to
the
orchard
through
the
orchard
to
the
lawn
of
humphrey
goode
house
and
across
this
to
goode
side
door
he
stood
there
for
a
few
seconds
imagining
himself
opening
the
door
and
going
inside
then
he
stopped
the
timing
hands
and
returned
to
the
fleming
house
locking
the
garage
doors
behind
him
in
the
garage
he
looked
at
the
watch
it
had
taken
exactly
six
minutes
and
seconds
he
knew
that
he
could
move
more
rapidly
than
the
dumpy
lawyer
but
to
balance
that
he
had
been
moving
over
more
or
less
unfamiliar
ground
he
left
his
hat
and
trench
coat
in
the
car
and
went
upstairs
undressing
he
went
into
the
bathroom
in
his
spent
about
twenty
minutes
shaving
and
taking
a
shower
and
then
returned
to
his
own
room
chapter
when
he
rose
the
next
morning
rand
noticed
something
which
had
escaped
his
eye
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before
his
in
its
was
lying
on
the
dresser
he
had
not
bothered
putting
it
on
when
he
had
gone
to
see
rivers
the
morning
before
and
it
had
lain
there
all
the
previous
day
he
distinctly
remembered
having
moved
it
shortly
after
dinner
when
he
had
gone
to
his
room
for
some
notes
he
had
made
on
the
collection
however
between
that
time
and
the
present
it
had
managed
to
flop
itself
over
the
holster
was
now
lying
intrigued
by
such
a
remarkable
accomplishment
in
an
inanimate
object
rand
crossed
the
room
in
the
in
which
he
slept
and
looked
more
closely
at
it
receiving
a
second
and
considerably
more
severe
surprise
the
revolver
in
the
holster
was
not
his
own
it
was
to
be
sure
a
colt
detective
special
and
it
was
in
his
holster
but
it
was
not
the
detective
special
he
had
brought
with
him
from
new
belfast
his
own
gun
was
of
the
second
type
with
the
corners
rounded
off
the
grip
this
one
was
of
the
original
issue
with
the
square
police
positive
grip
his
own
gun
had
seen
hard
service
this
one
was
in
practically
new
condition
there
was
a
discrepancy
of
about
thirty
thousand
in
the
serial
numbers
his
gun
had
been
loaded
in
six
chambers
with
the
standard
loads
this
one
was
loaded
in
only
five
with
loads
rand
stood
for
some
time
looking
at
the
revolver
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
be
exactly
sure
when
the
substitution
had
been
made
it
might
have
happened
at
any
time
between
eight
and
twelve
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
rather
suspected
that
it
had
been
accomplished
while
he
had
been
in
the
bathroom
however
dumping
out
the
five
rounds
in
the
cylinder
he
inspected
the
changeling
carefully
it
was
he
thought
the
revolver
lane
fleming
had
kept
in
the
drawer
of
the
gunroom
desk
there
was
no
obstruction
in
the
barrel
the
weapon
had
not
been
either
fired
or
cleaned
recently
the
had
not
been
shortened
the
mainspring
showed
the
proper
amount
of
tension
and
the
mechanism
functioned
as
it
should
there
was
a
chance
that
somebody
had
made
up
five
special
for
him
using
nitroglycerin
instead
of
powder
but
that
did
seem
likely
as
it
would
not
necessitate
a
switch
of
revolvers
there
were
four
or
five
other
possibilities
all
of
them
disquieting
he
would
have
been
a
great
deal
less
alarmed
if
somebody
had
taken
a
shot
at
him
getting
a
box
of
cartridges
out
of
his
gladstone
he
filled
the
cylinder
with
loads
when
he
went
to
the
bathroom
he
took
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
when
he
dressed
he
put
on
the
and
pocketed
a
handful
of
spare
rounds
anton
varcek
was
loitering
in
the
hall
when
he
came
out
he
gave
rand
and
fell
into
step
with
him
as
they
went
toward
the
stairway
colonel
rand
i
wish
you
would
mention
this
to
anybody
but
i
would
like
a
private
talk
with
you
the
czech
said
after
fred
dunmore
has
left
for
the
plant
would
that
be
possible
yes
varcek
i
be
in
the
gunroom
all
morning
working
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
where
gladys
was
waiting
understand
rand
continued
i
never
really
studied
biology
i
was
exposed
to
it
in
school
but
at
that
time
i
was
preoccupied
with
the
social
sciences
varcek
took
the
conversational
shift
in
stride
of
course
he
agreed
but
you
are
trained
in
the
scientific
method
of
thought
that
at
least
is
something
when
i
have
opportunity
to
explain
my
ideas
more
fully
i
believe
you
will
be
interested
in
my
conclusions
they
greeted
gladys
and
walked
with
her
to
the
as
usual
geraldine
was
absent
dunmore
and
nelda
were
already
at
the
table
eating
in
silence
both
of
them
seemed
after
the
pitched
battle
of
the
evening
before
rand
broke
the
tension
by
offering
humphrey
goode
in
the
role
of
he
had
no
sooner
made
a
remark
in
derogation
of
the
lawyer
than
nelda
and
her
husband
broke
into
a
duet
of
vituperation
in
the
end
everybody
affected
to
agree
that
the
whole
unpleasant
scene
had
been
entirely
goode
fault
and
a
pleasant
spirit
of
mutual
cordiality
prevailed
finally
dunmore
got
up
wiping
his
mouth
on
a
napkin
well
it
about
time
to
get
to
work
he
said
we
might
as
well
save
gas
and
both
use
my
car
coming
anton
i
sorry
fred
i
ca
leave
yet
i
have
some
notes
upstairs
i
have
to
get
in
order
i
was
working
on
this
new
last
evening
and
i
want
to
continue
the
experiments
at
the
plant
laboratory
i
think
i
know
how
we
be
able
to
cut
production
costs
on
it
about
five
per
cent
and
boy
can
we
stand
that
dunmore
grunted
well
be
seeing
you
at
the
plant
rand
waited
until
dunmore
had
left
then
went
across
to
the
library
and
up
to
the
gunroom
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
above
he
saw
what
was
wrong
the
previous
thefts
had
been
masked
by
substitutions
but
whoever
had
helped
himself
to
one
of
the
more
recent
specimens
the
night
before
had
bothered
with
any
such
precaution
and
a
pair
of
vacant
screwhooks
disclosed
the
removal
a
second
look
told
rand
what
had
been
taken
the
little
webley
scott
from
the
pollard
collection
with
the
silencer
the
which
had
been
imposed
on
him
had
disquieted
him
now
he
had
no
hesitation
in
admitting
to
himself
he
was
badly
scared
whoever
had
taken
that
little
automatic
had
had
only
one
thought
in
mind
noiseless
and
stealthy
murder
very
probably
with
one
colonel
jefferson
davis
rand
in
mind
as
the
prospective
corpse
he
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
started
typing
at
the
same
time
trying
to
keep
the
hall
door
and
the
head
of
the
spiral
stairway
under
observation
it
was
an
attempt
which
was
responsible
for
quite
a
number
of
typographical
errors
finally
anton
varcek
came
in
from
the
hallway
approached
the
desk
and
sat
down
in
an
armchair
colonel
rand
he
began
in
a
low
voice
i
have
been
thinking
over
a
remark
you
made
last
evening
were
you
serious
when
you
alluded
to
the
possibility
that
lane
fleming
had
been
murdered
well
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
rand
understated
keeping
his
right
hand
close
to
his
left
coat
lapel
i
take
it
you
have
begun
to
doubt
that
it
was
an
accident
i
would
doubt
a
theory
that
a
skilled
chemist
would
accidentally
poison
himself
in
his
own
laboratory
varcek
replied
i
would
not
for
instance
pour
myself
a
drink
from
a
bottle
labeled
in
the
belief
that
it
contained
vodka
i
believe
that
lane
fleming
should
be
credited
with
equal
caution
about
firearms
yet
you
were
the
first
to
advance
the
theory
that
the
shooting
had
been
an
accident
rand
pointed
out
i
have
a
strong
dislike
for
firearms
varcek
looked
at
the
pistols
on
the
desk
as
though
they
were
so
many
rattlesnakes
i
have
always
feared
an
accident
with
so
many
in
the
house
when
i
saw
him
lying
dead
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
that
was
my
first
thought
first
thoughts
are
so
often
illogical
emotional
and
you
did
consider
the
possibility
of
suicide
no
absolutely
not
the
czech
was
emphatic
the
idea
never
occurred
to
me
then
or
since
lane
fleming
was
not
the
man
to
do
that
he
was
deeply
religious
much
interested
in
church
work
and
aside
from
that
he
had
no
reason
to
wish
to
die
his
health
was
excellent
much
better
than
that
of
many
men
twenty
years
his
junior
he
had
no
business
worries
the
company
is
doing
well
we
had
large
government
contracts
during
the
war
and
no
reconversion
problems
afterward
we
now
have
more
orders
than
we
have
plant
capacity
to
fill
and
fleming
was
consulting
with
architects
about
plant
expansion
we
have
been
spared
any
serious
labor
troubles
and
fleming
wife
was
devoted
to
him
and
he
to
her
he
had
no
family
troubles
rand
raised
an
eyebrow
over
that
last
no
he
inquired
varcek
flushed
please
colonel
rand
you
must
not
judge
by
what
you
have
seen
since
you
came
here
when
lane
fleming
was
alive
such
scenes
as
that
in
the
library
last
evening
would
have
been
unthinkable
now
this
family
is
like
a
ship
without
a
captain
and
since
you
do
not
think
that
he
shot
himself
either
deliberately
or
inadvertently
there
remains
the
alternative
that
he
was
shot
by
somebody
else
either
deliberately
or
very
improbably
by
inadvertence
rand
said
i
think
the
latter
can
be
safely
disregarded
let
agree
that
it
was
murder
and
go
on
from
there
varcek
nodded
you
are
investigating
it
as
such
he
asked
i
am
appraising
and
selling
this
pistol
collection
rand
told
him
wearily
i
am
curious
about
who
killed
fleming
of
course
for
my
own
protection
i
like
to
know
the
background
of
situations
in
which
i
am
involved
but
do
you
think
humphrey
goode
would
bring
me
here
to
stir
up
a
lot
of
sleeping
dogs
that
might
awake
and
grab
him
by
the
or
did
you
think
that
uproar
in
the
library
last
evening
was
just
a
prearranged
act
i
had
not
thought
of
humphrey
goode
it
was
my
understanding
that
fleming
brought
you
here
fleming
wants
her
money
out
of
the
collection
as
soon
as
possible
rand
said
to
reopen
the
question
of
her
husband
death
and
start
a
murder
investigation
would
exactly
expedite
things
i
just
a
more
or
less
innocent
bystander
who
wants
to
know
whether
there
is
going
to
be
any
trouble
or
not
now
you
came
here
to
tell
me
what
happened
on
the
night
of
lane
fleming
death
did
you
yes
we
had
finished
dinner
at
about
seven
varcek
said
lane
had
been
up
here
for
about
an
hour
before
dinner
working
on
his
new
revolver
he
came
back
here
immediately
after
he
was
through
eating
a
little
later
when
i
had
finished
my
coffee
i
came
upstairs
by
the
main
stairway
the
door
of
this
room
was
open
and
lane
was
inside
sitting
on
that
old
working
on
the
revolver
he
had
it
apart
and
he
was
cleaning
a
part
of
it
the
round
part
where
the
loads
go
the
drum
is
it
cylinder
how
was
he
cleaning
it
rand
asked
he
was
using
a
small
brush
like
a
brush
he
was
scrubbing
out
the
holes
the
chambers
he
was
using
a
solvent
that
smelled
something
like
rand
nodded
he
could
visualize
the
progress
fleming
had
made
if
varcek
was
telling
the
truth
and
he
remembered
what
walters
had
told
him
the
last
flicker
of
possibility
that
lane
fleming
death
had
been
accidental
vanished
i
talked
with
him
for
some
ten
minutes
or
so
varcek
continued
about
some
technical
problems
at
the
plant
all
the
while
he
kept
on
working
on
this
revolver
and
finished
cleaning
out
the
cylinder
and
also
the
barrel
he
was
beginning
to
put
the
revolver
together
when
i
left
him
and
went
up
to
my
laboratory
about
fifteen
minutes
later
i
heard
the
shot
for
a
moment
i
debated
with
myself
as
to
what
i
had
heard
and
then
i
decided
to
come
down
here
but
first
i
had
to
take
a
solution
off
a
bunsen
burner
where
i
had
been
heating
it
and
take
the
temperature
of
it
and
then
wash
my
hands
because
i
had
been
working
with
poisonous
materials
i
should
say
all
this
took
me
about
five
minutes
when
i
got
down
here
the
door
of
this
room
was
closed
and
locked
that
was
most
unusual
and
i
became
really
worried
i
pounded
on
the
door
and
called
out
but
i
got
no
answer
then
fred
dunmore
came
out
of
the
bathroom
attached
to
his
room
with
nothing
on
but
a
bathrobe
his
hair
was
wet
and
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
and
making
wet
tracks
on
the
floor
from
there
on
varcek
story
tallied
closely
with
what
rand
had
heard
from
gladys
and
from
walters
everybody
story
tallied
where
it
could
be
checked
up
on
you
think
the
murderer
locked
the
door
behind
him
when
he
came
out
of
here
varcek
asked
i
think
somebody
locked
the
door
sometime
it
might
have
been
the
murderer
or
it
might
have
been
fleming
at
the
murderer
suggestion
but
why
could
the
murderer
have
left
the
gunroom
by
that
stairway
varcek
looked
around
furtively
and
lowered
his
voice
now
he
looked
like
rudolf
hess
discussing
what
to
do
about
ernst
roehm
colonel
rand
do
you
think
that
fred
dunmore
could
have
shot
lane
fleming
and
then
have
gone
to
his
room
and
waited
until
i
came
downstairs
he
asked
here
we
go
again
rand
thought
just
like
the
rivers
case
everybody
putting
the
finger
on
everybody
else
and
have
undressed
and
taken
a
bath
while
he
was
waiting
he
inquired
you
came
down
here
only
five
minutes
after
the
shot
in
that
time
dunmore
would
have
had
to
wipe
his
fingerprints
off
the
revolver
leave
it
in
fleming
hand
put
that
oily
rag
in
his
other
hand
set
the
deadlatch
cross
the
hall
undress
get
into
the
bathtub
and
start
bathing
that
pretty
fast
work
but
who
else
could
have
done
it
well
you
for
one
you
could
have
come
down
from
your
lab
shot
fleming
faked
the
suicide
and
then
gone
out
locking
the
door
behind
you
and
made
a
demonstration
in
the
hall
until
you
were
joined
by
dunmore
and
the
ladies
then
with
your
innocence
well
established
you
could
have
waited
until
your
wife
prompted
you
as
she
or
somebody
else
was
sure
to
and
then
have
gone
down
to
the
library
and
up
the
spiral
rand
said
that
about
as
convincing
no
more
and
no
less
as
your
theory
about
dunmore
varcek
agreed
sadly
and
i
can
not
prove
otherwise
can
i
you
can
advance
your
dunmore
theory
to
establish
reasonable
doubt
rand
told
him
and
if
dunmore
accused
he
can
do
the
same
with
the
theory
i
just
outlined
and
as
long
as
reasonable
doubt
exists
neither
of
you
could
be
convicted
this
is
the
third
reich
or
the
soviet
union
they
would
execute
both
of
you
to
make
sure
of
getting
the
right
one
both
of
you
had
a
motive
in
this
merger
that
could
have
been
negotiated
while
fleming
lived
one
or
the
other
of
you
may
be
guilty
on
the
other
hand
both
of
you
may
be
innocent
then
who
varcek
had
evidently
bet
his
roll
on
dunmore
there
is
no
one
else
who
could
have
done
it
the
garage
doors
were
open
if
i
recall
rand
pointed
out
anybody
could
have
slipped
in
that
way
come
through
the
rear
hall
to
the
library
and
up
the
spiral
and
have
gone
out
the
same
way
some
of
the
french
maquis
i
worked
with
during
the
war
could
have
wiped
out
the
whole
family
one
after
the
other
that
way
a
look
of
intense
concentration
settled
upon
varcek
face
he
nodded
several
times
yes
of
course
he
said
his
complete
and
you
spoke
of
motive
from
what
you
must
have
heard
last
evening
humphrey
goode
was
no
less
interested
in
the
merger
than
fred
dunmore
or
myself
and
then
there
is
your
friend
gresham
he
is
quite
familiar
with
the
interior
of
this
house
and
who
knows
what
terms
national
milling
packaging
may
have
made
with
him
contingent
upon
his
success
in
negotiating
the
merger
i
not
forgetting
either
of
them
rand
said
or
fred
dunmore
or
you
if
you
did
it
i
advise
you
to
confess
now
it
save
everybody
yourself
included
a
lot
of
trouble
varcek
looked
at
him
fascinated
why
i
believe
you
regard
all
of
us
just
as
i
do
my
fruit
flies
he
said
at
length
you
know
colonel
rand
you
are
not
a
comfortable
sort
of
man
to
have
around
he
rose
slowly
naturally
i
not
mention
this
interview
i
suppose
you
wo
want
to
either
i
advise
you
not
to
talk
about
it
at
that
rand
said
the
situation
here
seems
to
be
very
delicate
and
rather
explosive
oh
as
you
go
out
i
be
obliged
to
you
for
sending
walters
up
here
i
still
have
this
work
here
and
i
need
his
help
after
varcek
had
left
him
rand
looked
in
the
desk
drawer
verifying
his
assumption
that
the
he
had
seen
there
was
gone
he
wondered
where
his
own
was
at
the
moment
when
the
butler
arrived
he
was
put
to
work
bringing
pistols
to
the
desk
carrying
them
back
to
the
racks
taking
measurements
and
the
like
all
the
while
rand
kept
his
eye
on
the
head
of
the
spiral
stairway
finally
he
caught
a
movement
and
saw
what
looked
like
the
top
of
a
gray
felt
hat
between
the
spindles
of
the
railing
he
eased
the
detective
special
out
of
its
holster
and
got
to
his
feet
all
right
he
sang
out
come
on
up
walters
looked
obviously
startled
at
the
revolver
that
had
materialized
in
rand
hand
and
at
the
two
men
who
were
emerging
from
the
spiral
he
was
even
more
startled
it
seemed
when
he
realized
that
they
wore
the
uniform
of
the
state
police
what
what
the
meaning
of
this
sir
he
demanded
of
rand
you
being
arrested
rand
told
him
just
stand
still
now
he
stepped
around
the
desk
and
frisked
the
butler
quickly
wondering
if
he
were
going
to
find
a
webley
scott
automatic
or
his
own
when
he
found
neither
he
holstered
his
temporary
weapon
if
this
is
your
idea
of
a
joke
sir
permit
me
to
say
that
it
is
it
no
joke
son
sergeant
mckenna
told
him
in
this
country
a
does
have
to
recite
any
incantation
before
he
makes
an
arrest
any
more
than
he
needs
to
read
any
riot
act
before
he
can
start
shooting
but
it
wo
hurt
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
at
least
i
must
insist
upon
knowing
why
i
am
being
arrested
walters
said
icily
oh
do
you
know
mckenna
asked
why
you
being
arrested
for
the
murder
of
arnold
rivers
for
a
moment
the
butler
retained
his
professional
glacial
disdain
and
then
the
bottom
seemed
to
drop
suddenly
out
of
him
rand
suppressed
a
smile
at
this
minor
verification
of
his
theory
walters
had
been
expecting
to
be
accused
of
larceny
and
was
prepared
to
treat
the
charge
with
contempt
then
he
had
realized
after
a
second
or
so
what
the
state
police
sergeant
had
really
said
good
god
gentlemen
he
looked
from
mick
mckenna
to
corporal
kavaalen
to
rand
and
back
again
in
bewilderment
you
surely
ca
mean
that
we
can
and
we
do
rand
told
him
you
stole
about
pistols
from
this
collection
after
fleming
died
and
sold
them
to
arnold
rivers
then
when
i
came
here
and
started
checking
up
on
the
collection
you
knew
the
game
was
up
so
last
evening
you
took
out
the
and
went
to
see
rivers
and
you
killed
him
to
keep
him
from
turning
state
evidence
and
incriminating
you
or
maybe
you
killed
him
in
a
quarrel
over
the
division
of
the
loot
i
hope
for
your
sake
that
it
was
the
latter
if
it
was
you
may
get
off
with
second
degree
murder
but
if
you
ca
prove
that
there
was
no
premeditation
you
tagged
for
the
electric
chair
but
but
i
did
kill
rivers
walters
stammered
i
barely
knew
the
gentleman
i
saw
him
once
or
twice
when
he
was
here
to
see
fleming
but
outside
of
that
outside
of
that
you
sold
him
about
of
these
pistols
and
got
a
like
number
of
junk
pistols
from
him
for
replacements
he
took
the
list
pierre
jarrett
and
stephen
gresham
had
compiled
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
reading
italian
wheel
lock
pistol
late
or
early
pair
italian
snaphaunce
pistols
by
lazarino
cominazo
he
finished
the
list
and
put
it
away
i
think
we
missed
one
or
two
but
that
do
for
the
time
but
i
did
sell
those
pistols
to
rivers
walters
expostulated
i
sold
them
to
carl
gwinnett
i
can
prove
it
that
rand
had
not
expected
go
on
he
jeered
i
suppose
you
have
receipts
for
all
of
them
fences
always
do
that
of
course
but
i
did
sell
them
to
gwinnett
i
can
take
you
to
his
house
if
you
get
a
search
warrant
and
show
you
where
he
has
them
hidden
in
the
garret
he
was
afraid
to
offer
them
for
sale
until
after
this
collection
had
been
broken
up
and
sold
he
still
has
every
one
of
them
mckenna
spat
out
an
obscenity
are
we
ever
going
to
have
any
luck
he
demanded
jarrett
out
on
a
writ
this
morning
and
now
this
but
he
ai
in
the
clear
kavaalen
argued
maybe
he
did
sell
rivers
the
pistols
but
maybe
he
did
kill
him
dope
mckenna
abused
his
subordinate
if
he
did
sell
rivers
the
pistols
why
would
he
kill
him
he
only
said
he
sold
them
to
gwinnett
rand
pointed
out
then
he
turned
to
walters
look
here
if
we
find
those
pistols
in
possession
you
clear
on
this
murder
charge
there
still
a
slight
matter
of
larceny
but
that
does
involve
the
electric
chair
you
take
my
advice
and
make
a
confession
now
and
then
accompany
these
officers
to
gwinnett
place
and
show
them
the
pistols
if
you
do
that
you
may
expect
clemency
on
the
theft
charge
too
oh
i
will
sir
i
sign
a
full
confession
and
take
these
and
show
them
every
one
of
the
pistols
rand
put
paper
and
carbon
sheets
in
the
typewriter
as
walters
dictated
he
typed
the
butler
listed
every
pistol
which
gresham
and
pierre
jarrett
had
found
missing
and
a
cased
presentation
pair
of
colt
that
nobody
had
missed
he
signed
the
triplicate
copies
willingly
he
seem
to
mind
signing
himself
into
jail
as
long
as
he
thought
he
was
signing
himself
out
of
the
electric
chair
the
book
in
which
fleming
had
recorded
his
pistols
he
still
had
he
had
removed
it
from
the
gunroom
and
was
keeping
it
in
his
room
he
said
he
would
get
it
along
with
the
things
he
would
need
to
take
to
jail
with
him
when
it
was
finished
they
all
went
down
the
spiral
stairway
into
the
library
nelda
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
it
evidently
she
had
been
listening
to
what
had
been
going
on
upstairs
you
dirty
sneak
she
yelled
catching
sight
of
walters
after
all
we
done
for
you
you
turn
around
and
rob
us
i
hope
they
give
you
twenty
years
walters
turned
to
mckenna
sergeant
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
penalty
of
the
law
for
what
i
have
done
but
i
do
believe
sir
that
it
includes
being
yapped
at
by
this
vulgar
bitch
nelda
let
out
an
inarticulate
howl
of
fury
and
sprang
at
him
nails
raking
corporal
kavaalen
caught
her
wrist
before
she
could
claw
the
prisoner
that
enough
you
he
told
her
you
stop
that
or
you
spend
a
night
in
jail
yourself
she
jerked
her
arm
loose
from
his
grasp
and
flung
out
of
the
library
as
she
went
out
gladys
entered
rand
who
had
been
bringing
up
in
the
rear
stepped
down
from
the
stairway
he
confessed
he
said
softly
we
had
to
bluff
it
out
of
him
but
he
came
across
sold
the
pistols
to
carl
gwinnett
we
going
now
to
pick
up
gwinnett
and
the
pistols
i
glad
you
found
the
pistols
she
told
him
but
what
we
going
to
do
over
the
for
a
butler
rand
snapped
his
fingers
dammit
i
never
thought
of
that
he
allowed
his
brow
to
furrow
with
thought
i
wo
promise
anything
but
i
may
be
able
to
dig
up
somebody
for
you
for
a
day
or
so
some
of
my
friends
are
visiting
their
son
in
a
naval
hospital
on
the
west
coast
and
their
butler
may
be
glad
for
a
chance
to
pick
up
a
little
extra
money
shall
i
call
him
and
find
out
oh
colonel
rand
would
you
i
be
eternally
grateful
it
was
just
as
easy
as
that
chapter
dave
ritter
driving
his
small
coupé
kept
his
eye
on
the
white
state
police
car
ahead
rand
who
had
come
away
from
the
fleming
home
in
the
white
car
had
called
ritter
from
the
office
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
while
waiting
for
walters
to
put
up
bail
after
his
hearing
now
en
route
to
gwinnett
he
was
briefing
his
assistant
on
what
had
happened
so
everything
set
he
concluded
fleming
jumped
at
it
she
knows
you
coming
in
your
own
car
which
you
may
keep
in
the
garage
there
you
left
new
belfast
about
now
if
you
show
up
around
three
you
be
safe
on
the
driving
time
your
name
is
davies
i
decided
on
that
in
case
i
suffer
a
and
call
you
dave
in
front
of
somebody
yeah
i
have
to
watch
and
not
call
you
jeff
colonel
rand
sir
he
nodded
toward
the
that
leech
rigdon
in
there
better
get
it
out
before
i
go
to
the
flemings
the
guy
at
the
made
a
positive
identification
it
the
one
he
sold
fleming
i
saw
the
rest
of
the
pistols
he
has
there
do
waste
time
looking
him
up
about
them
they
stink
and
i
saw
tip
this
morning
he
got
young
jarrett
sprung
on
a
writ
he
thought
for
a
moment
what
does
this
do
to
the
rivers
and
fleming
murders
we
can
look
for
one
man
for
both
jobs
now
rand
said
probably
the
motive
for
fleming
was
that
merger
he
was
so
violently
opposed
to
and
the
rivers
killing
must
have
been
a
security
measure
of
some
sort
there
that
must
be
gwinnett
now
the
state
police
car
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
frame
house
with
faded
and
discolored
paint
and
jigsaw
scrollwork
around
the
cornices
standing
among
a
clump
of
trees
beside
the
road
mckenna
and
kavaalen
got
out
with
walters
between
them
and
started
up
the
path
to
the
front
steps
ritter
stopped
behind
the
white
sedan
and
he
and
rand
got
out
by
that
time
walters
and
the
two
policemen
were
on
the
front
porch
suddenly
ritter
turned
and
sprinted
around
the
right
side
of
the
house
rand
stood
looking
after
him
for
a
moment
then
started
to
follow
more
slowly
as
he
did
a
shot
slammed
in
the
rear
jerking
out
the
changeling
he
whirled
and
ran
around
the
left
side
of
the
house
arriving
at
the
rear
in
time
to
see
gwinnett
standing
on
a
boardwalk
between
the
house
and
the
behind
with
his
hands
raised
there
was
a
fresh
on
the
boardwalk
at
his
feet
ritter
was
covering
him
from
the
corner
of
the
house
with
the
beretta
rand
strolled
over
to
gwinnett
frisked
him
and
told
him
to
put
his
hands
down
nice
dave
he
complimented
i
thought
of
that
too
about
a
minute
too
late
as
soon
as
he
saw
walters
coming
up
the
walk
with
the
police
he
knew
what
had
happened
come
on
gwinnett
we
go
through
the
house
and
let
them
in
gwinnett
eyes
darted
from
side
to
side
like
the
eyes
of
a
trapped
animal
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
said
what
is
this
a
nobody
bothered
to
tell
him
to
stop
kidding
they
marched
him
through
the
kitchen
where
a
negro
girl
her
arms
white
with
flour
was
dithering
in
fright
and
into
the
front
hall
a
woman
in
a
faded
housedress
had
just
admitted
the
two
officers
and
the
former
fleming
butler
you
goddam
rat
gwinnett
yelled
at
walters
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
for
god
sake
carl
the
woman
begged
do
make
things
any
worse
than
they
are
keep
quiet
all
right
gwinnett
mckenna
said
we
arresting
you
receiving
stolen
goods
and
accessory
to
larceny
we
have
a
search
warrant
want
to
see
it
so
you
have
a
search
warrant
gwinnett
said
so
go
ahead
and
search
if
you
do
find
anything
you
plant
something
i
want
to
call
my
lawyer
that
your
right
mckenna
told
him
aarvo
take
him
to
a
phone
let
him
call
the
white
house
if
he
wants
to
he
turned
to
walters
now
where
would
he
have
this
stuff
stashed
in
the
garret
sir
i
know
the
way
as
kavaalen
accompanied
gwinnett
to
the
phone
walters
started
upstairs
rand
and
mckenna
followed
with
gwinnett
bringing
up
the
rear
during
the
search
of
the
attic
she
stood
to
one
side
watching
the
dig
into
a
pile
of
pistols
this
is
one
gentlemen
walters
said
producing
a
springfield
model
flintlock
and
here
is
the
walker
colt
and
the
colt
paterson
and
the
hall
eventually
he
had
them
all
assembled
including
the
five
cased
sets
rand
found
a
couple
of
empty
bushel
baskets
and
laid
the
pistols
in
them
between
layers
of
old
newspapers
he
picked
up
one
and
mckenna
took
the
other
while
walters
piled
the
five
flat
hardwood
cases
into
his
arms
like
cordwood
still
saying
nothing
her
eyes
stony
with
hatred
the
woman
followed
them
downstairs
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
consumed
with
formalities
gwinnett
was
given
a
hearing
at
which
he
was
represented
by
a
lawyer
straight
out
of
a
gangster
picture
rand
had
a
heated
argument
with
an
justice
of
the
peace
who
wanted
to
impound
the
pistols
and
them
for
identification
but
after
hurling
bloodthirsty
threats
of
a
damage
suit
for
an
astronomical
figure
he
managed
to
retain
possession
of
the
recovered
weapons
ritter
left
at
a
little
past
three
to
report
for
duty
in
the
fleming
household
rand
rode
with
mckenna
and
kavaalen
to
the
state
police
substation
where
the
pistols
were
transferred
to
mckenna
personal
car
in
which
they
and
rand
were
to
be
transported
back
to
the
fleming
place
it
was
five
before
rand
had
finished
telling
the
sergeant
and
the
corporal
everything
he
felt
they
ought
to
know
when
we
get
to
the
flemings
i
give
you
that
revolver
i
got
from
the
coroner
he
finished
one
of
your
boys
can
take
it
to
this
fellow
umholtz
and
get
him
to
identify
it
you
might
also
show
it
to
young
gillis
and
see
what
he
knows
about
it
gillis
might
even
give
you
a
name
for
who
got
it
from
rivers
i
not
building
any
hopes
on
that
and
the
reason
i
not
is
that
gillis
is
still
alive
if
he
knew
i
do
think
he
would
be
yeah
i
can
see
that
mckenna
nodded
fact
is
i
can
see
everything
now
except
one
thing
this
somebody
gave
you
what
the
idea
of
that
why
that
because
i
on
the
spot
rand
told
him
i
to
be
killed
and
somebody
else
is
to
be
killed
along
with
me
the
automatic
will
be
used
on
me
and
the
will
be
used
on
the
other
fellow
and
we
be
found
dead
about
five
feet
apart
and
i
be
holding
my
own
gun
and
the
other
fellow
will
be
holding
the
and
it
will
look
as
though
we
shot
it
out
and
scored
a
double
knockout
that
way
my
mouth
will
be
shut
about
what
i
learned
since
i
came
here
and
the
man
who
supposed
to
have
killed
me
will
take
the
rap
for
fleming
and
rivers
both
nothing
to
stop
an
investigation
like
a
couple
of
corpses
who
ca
tell
their
own
story
and
can
take
the
blame
for
everything
kavaalen
eyes
widened
that
must
be
just
it
well
you
got
your
nerve
about
you
i
say
that
mckenna
commented
you
sit
there
and
talk
about
it
like
it
was
something
that
was
going
to
happen
to
joe
doakes
and
oscar
zilch
he
looked
at
rand
intently
you
want
us
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
rand
leaned
over
and
spat
into
the
brass
cuspidor
a
gesture
of
braggadocio
he
had
picked
up
among
the
french
maquis
hell
no
that
the
last
thing
i
do
want
he
said
i
want
him
to
try
it
you
realize
do
you
that
all
this
is
pure
assumption
and
theory
we
do
have
a
single
fact
as
it
stands
that
proves
anything
we
could
go
and
pick
this
fellow
up
and
he
one
of
three
men
so
we
could
grab
all
three
of
them
and
even
if
we
found
the
webley
scott
and
my
in
his
pockets
we
could
charge
him
with
anything
fact
is
right
now
we
ca
even
prove
that
lane
fleming
death
was
anything
but
the
accident
it
on
the
books
as
being
but
let
him
take
a
shot
at
me
and
then
you
have
another
nice
clear
case
of
mckenna
frowned
goddammit
jeff
you
had
to
defend
yourself
too
many
times
already
this
be
well
how
many
will
it
be
counting
germans
rand
grinned
hell
i
do
know
i
ca
remember
all
of
them
one
thing
kavaalen
said
solemnly
you
never
hear
of
any
lawyers
springing
people
out
of
cemeteries
on
writs
look
jeff
mckenna
said
at
length
if
it
the
way
you
think
this
guy
wo
dare
kill
you
instantly
will
he
seems
to
me
the
way
the
script
reads
this
other
guy
shoots
you
and
you
shoot
back
and
kill
him
and
then
you
die
is
that
it
rand
nodded
i
banking
on
that
he
try
to
give
me
a
fatal
but
not
instantly
fatal
wound
and
that
means
he
have
to
take
time
to
pick
his
spot
the
reason
i
managed
to
survive
these
people
against
whom
had
to
defend
myself
has
been
that
i
just
do
give
a
damn
where
i
shoot
a
man
a
lot
of
good
police
officers
have
gotten
themselves
killed
because
they
tried
to
wing
somebody
and
took
a
second
or
so
longer
about
shooting
than
they
should
have
something
in
that
too
mckenna
agreed
but
what
i
getting
at
is
this
i
think
i
know
a
way
to
give
you
a
little
more
percentage
he
rose
wait
a
minute
i
be
right
back
chapter
there
was
less
feuding
at
dinner
that
evening
than
at
any
previous
meal
rand
had
eaten
in
the
fleming
home
in
the
first
place
everybody
seemed
a
little
awed
in
the
presence
of
the
new
butler
who
flitted
in
and
out
of
the
room
like
a
ghost
and
when
spoken
to
answered
in
a
heavy
accent
then
the
women
who
carried
on
most
of
the
hostilities
had
their
and
were
sharing
a
common
pleasure
in
the
recovery
of
the
stolen
pistols
and
finally
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
the
swift
and
dramatic
justice
that
had
overtaken
walters
and
gwinnett
at
rand
hands
was
having
a
sobering
effect
upon
somebody
at
that
table
dunmore
nelda
varcek
geraldine
and
gladys
had
been
intending
to
go
to
a
party
that
evening
but
at
the
last
minute
gladys
had
pleaded
indisposition
and
telephoned
regrets
the
meal
over
rand
had
gone
up
to
the
gunroom
gladys
drifted
into
the
small
off
the
and
the
others
had
gone
to
their
rooms
to
dress
rand
was
taking
down
the
junk
with
which
walters
had
infiltrated
the
collection
and
was
listing
and
hanging
up
the
recovered
items
when
fred
dunmore
wearing
a
strolled
in
i
ca
get
over
the
idea
of
walters
being
a
thief
he
sorrowed
i
would
have
believed
it
if
i
had
seen
his
signed
confession
well
it
just
goes
to
show
you
he
took
his
medicine
standing
up
rand
said
and
he
helped
us
recover
the
pistols
if
i
were
you
i
go
easy
with
him
dunmore
shook
his
head
i
not
a
revengeful
man
colonel
rand
he
said
but
if
there
one
thing
i
ca
forgive
it
a
disloyal
employee
his
mouth
closed
sternly
around
his
cigar
he
have
to
take
what
coming
to
him
he
stood
by
the
desk
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
recovered
items
and
the
pile
of
junk
on
the
floor
when
did
you
first
suspect
him
almost
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
this
collection
rand
explained
the
reasoning
which
had
led
him
to
suspect
walters
the
real
clincher
to
my
mind
was
the
fact
that
he
knew
this
collection
almost
as
well
as
lane
fleming
did
and
would
be
likely
to
be
deceived
by
these
substitutions
any
more
than
fleming
would
yet
he
said
nothing
to
anybody
neither
to
fleming
nor
goode
nor
myself
if
he
were
guilty
himself
i
wanted
to
know
his
reason
for
keeping
silent
so
i
put
the
pressure
on
him
and
he
cracked
open
well
i
want
you
to
know
how
grateful
we
all
are
dunmore
said
feelingly
i
kicking
hell
out
of
myself
now
about
the
way
i
objected
when
gladys
brought
you
in
here
my
god
suppose
we
tried
to
sell
the
collection
ourselves
anybody
who
have
been
interested
in
buying
would
have
seen
what
you
saw
and
then
they
have
claimed
that
we
were
trying
to
hold
out
on
them
he
hesitated
you
seen
how
things
are
here
he
continued
ruefully
and
that
something
else
i
have
to
thank
you
for
i
mean
keeping
your
mouth
shut
till
you
got
the
pistols
back
there
have
been
a
hell
of
a
row
everybody
would
have
blamed
everybody
else
how
did
you
get
him
to
confess
though
rand
told
him
about
the
subterfuge
of
the
murder
charge
dunmore
had
evidently
never
thought
of
that
hoary
device
he
chuckled
appreciatively
say
that
smart
no
wonder
he
was
so
willing
to
admit
everything
and
help
you
get
them
back
he
looked
at
the
pistols
on
the
desk
and
moved
one
or
two
of
them
did
you
get
the
one
the
coroner
had
goode
said
something
oh
yes
i
got
that
yesterday
rand
turned
and
went
to
the
workbench
bringing
back
the
leech
rigdon
which
he
handed
to
dunmore
that
it
i
fired
out
the
other
five
charges
and
cleaned
it
at
the
state
police
substation
he
watched
dunmore
closely
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
reaction
so
that
it
dunmore
looked
at
it
with
a
show
of
interest
and
honest
sorrow
and
handed
it
back
then
shifted
his
cigar
across
his
mouth
look
here
colonel
i
been
wanting
to
ask
you
something
did
gladys
just
get
you
to
come
here
to
appraise
and
sell
the
collection
or
are
you
investigating
lane
death
too
well
now
you
asking
me
to
be
disloyal
to
my
employer
rand
objected
why
do
you
ask
her
that
if
she
wants
you
to
know
tell
you
dammit
i
ca
suppose
she
satisfied
that
it
really
was
an
accident
would
i
want
to
start
her
worrying
and
imagining
things
no
i
suppose
you
would
rand
conceded
you
not
at
all
satisfied
on
that
point
yourself
are
you
well
are
you
dunmore
parried
that
sort
of
fencing
could
go
on
indefinitely
rand
determined
to
stop
it
after
all
if
dunmore
was
the
murderer
of
lane
fleming
he
would
already
know
how
little
rand
was
deceived
by
the
fake
accident
the
leech
rigdon
had
told
him
that
already
if
he
were
telling
him
would
do
no
harm
at
this
point
and
might
even
do
some
good
why
i
think
fleming
was
murdered
rand
told
him
as
casually
as
though
he
were
expressing
an
opinion
on
tomorrow
weather
and
i
further
believe
that
whoever
killed
fleming
also
killed
arnold
rivers
that
by
the
way
is
where
i
come
in
stephen
gresham
has
retained
me
to
find
the
rivers
murderer
to
do
that
i
must
first
learn
who
killed
lane
fleming
however
i
was
not
retained
to
investigate
the
fleming
murder
and
as
far
as
i
know
from
anything
she
has
told
me
gladys
fleming
is
quite
satisfied
that
her
husband
shot
himself
accidentally
in
a
universe
of
ordered
abstractions
and
multiordinal
meanings
the
literal
truth
on
one
order
of
abstraction
was
often
a
black
lie
on
another
does
that
answer
your
question
he
asked
with
innocence
dunmore
nodded
yes
i
get
it
now
look
here
do
you
think
anton
varcek
could
have
done
it
i
know
it
a
horrible
idea
and
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
not
making
any
accusations
but
we
always
took
it
for
granted
that
he
been
up
in
his
lab
and
had
come
downstairs
when
he
heard
the
shot
but
suppose
he
came
down
and
shot
fleming
and
then
went
out
in
the
hall
and
made
that
rumpus
outside
after
locking
the
door
behind
him
that
possible
rand
agreed
you
were
taking
a
bath
when
you
heard
the
shot
were
you
dunmore
shook
his
head
i
suppose
so
i
did
hear
any
shot
to
tell
the
truth
all
i
heard
was
anton
pounding
on
the
door
and
yelling
i
suppose
i
had
my
head
under
the
shower
and
the
noise
of
the
water
kept
me
from
hearing
the
shot
he
stopped
short
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
pointing
it
at
rand
and
by
god
that
would
have
been
about
five
minutes
before
he
started
hammering
on
the
door
he
exclaimed
time
enough
for
him
to
have
fixed
things
to
look
like
an
accident
set
the
deadlatch
and
have
gone
out
in
the
hall
and
started
making
a
noise
and
another
thing
you
say
that
whoever
killed
lane
also
killed
this
fellow
rivers
well
on
thursday
night
when
rivers
was
killed
anton
did
get
home
till
around
twelve
yes
i
thought
of
that
you
know
though
that
the
murderer
have
to
be
varcek
or
anybody
else
who
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
the
garage
doors
were
open
i
told
that
your
wife
was
out
at
the
time
and
anybody
could
have
sneaked
in
the
back
way
up
through
the
library
and
out
the
same
way
there
are
one
or
two
possibilities
besides
you
and
anton
varcek
dunmore
eyes
widened
yes
and
i
can
think
of
one
without
half
trying
too
he
nodded
once
or
twice
for
instance
the
man
who
was
afraid
you
were
investigating
fleming
death
the
man
who
started
that
suicide
story
he
looked
at
rand
interrogatively
well
i
got
to
go
nelda
be
out
of
the
bathroom
by
now
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
some
more
colonel
after
dunmore
had
gone
out
rand
mopped
his
face
the
room
seemed
insufferably
hot
he
found
an
electric
fan
over
the
workbench
and
plugged
it
in
but
it
made
enough
noise
to
cover
any
sounds
of
stealthy
approach
and
he
shut
it
off
he
had
finished
revising
his
list
to
include
the
recovered
pistols
for
as
far
as
it
was
completed
and
was
hanging
them
back
on
the
wall
when
ritter
came
in
house
is
clear
now
his
assistant
said
stepping
out
of
his
wodehouse
character
both
pairs
left
in
the
packard
dunmore
driving
man
what
a
show
this
place
is
it
a
wonder
our
client
is
nuts
you
have
seen
anything
you
ought
to
have
been
here
last
night
where
is
our
client
by
the
way
downstairs
ritter
fished
a
cigarette
out
of
his
livery
and
appropriated
rand
lighter
if
we
hear
her
coming
you
can
grab
this
he
brushed
a
couple
of
paterson
colts
to
one
side
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
taking
a
deep
drag
on
the
cigarette
what
the
regular
law
doing
now
that
young
jarrett
is
out
i
had
a
long
talk
with
mick
mckenna
rand
said
fortunately
mick
and
i
have
worked
together
before
i
was
able
to
tell
him
the
facts
of
life
and
he
be
a
good
boy
now
when
last
heard
from
farnsworth
was
beginning
to
blow
his
hot
breath
on
the
back
of
cecil
gillis
neck
ritter
picked
up
the
big
colt
walker
and
tried
the
balance
man
this
even
makes
that
colt
magnum
of
mine
feel
light
he
said
say
jeff
if
farnsworth
going
after
gillis
it
probably
on
account
of
those
stories
about
him
and
rivers
at
least
all
that
stuff
would
come
out
if
he
arrested
him
maybe
we
could
get
a
fee
out
of
mrs
rivers
i
thought
of
that
unfortunately
rivers
had
a
very
convenient
breakdown
when
she
heard
the
news
she
is
now
in
a
hospital
in
new
york
and
wo
be
back
until
after
the
funeral
prostrated
with
grief
or
something
and
this
case
is
due
to
blow
up
like
hiroshima
before
then
well
we
ca
get
fees
from
everybody
that
of
course
was
one
of
the
sad
things
of
life
to
which
one
must
reconcile
oneself
i
got
a
call
from
pierre
jarrett
tip
staying
at
the
jarrett
place
tonight
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
have
him
within
reach
for
a
while
the
private
outside
phone
rang
shrilly
ritter
let
it
go
for
several
rings
then
picked
it
up
this
is
the
fleming
residence
he
stated
putting
on
his
character
again
oh
yes
indeed
sir
colonel
rand
is
right
here
sir
i
tell
him
you
calling
he
put
a
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
humphrey
goode
rand
took
the
phone
and
named
himself
into
it
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
privately
colonel
rand
the
lawyer
said
on
a
subject
of
considerable
importance
to
our
shall
i
say
mutual
clients
could
you
find
time
to
drop
over
sometime
this
evening
well
i
very
busy
at
the
moment
goode
rand
regretted
there
have
been
some
rather
deplorable
developments
here
lately
the
butler
walters
has
been
arrested
for
larceny
it
seems
that
since
death
he
has
been
systematically
looting
the
trying
to
get
things
straightened
out
now
good
heavens
goode
was
considerably
shaken
when
did
you
discover
this
colonel
rand
and
why
was
i
notified
before
and
are
there
many
valuable
items
missing
i
discovered
it
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
collection
rand
began
answering
his
questions
in
order
neither
you
nor
anybody
else
was
notified
because
i
wanted
to
get
evidence
to
justify
an
arrest
first
and
nothing
is
missing
everything
has
been
recovered
he
finished
that
what
so
busy
about
now
getting
my
list
revised
and
straightening
out
the
collection
oh
fine
goode
was
delighted
i
hope
everything
was
handled
quietly
without
any
unnecessary
publicity
but
this
other
matter
i
do
care
to
go
into
it
over
the
phone
and
it
imperative
that
we
discuss
it
privately
at
once
well
suppose
you
come
over
here
goode
rand
suggested
that
way
i
wo
have
to
interrupt
my
work
so
much
there
nobody
at
home
now
but
fleming
and
as
she
indisposed
we
be
quite
alone
oh
very
well
i
think
that
really
a
good
idea
much
better
than
your
coming
over
here
i
see
you
directly
ritter
was
grinning
as
rand
hung
up
that
the
stuff
he
approved
the
old
hitler
technique
make
them
come
to
you
and
then
you
can
pound
the
table
and
yell
at
them
all
you
want
to
you
go
let
him
in
rand
directed
show
him
up
here
and
then
take
a
plant
on
that
spiral
stairway
out
of
the
library
just
out
of
sight
i
do
think
this
it
but
there
no
use
taking
chances
he
mopped
his
face
again
damn
it
hot
in
here
ten
minutes
later
ritter
ushered
in
humphrey
goode
and
inquired
if
there
would
be
anything
further
sir
when
rand
said
there
would
he
went
down
the
spiral
just
as
rand
had
expected
goode
began
peddling
the
same
line
as
varcek
and
dunmore
before
him
they
all
came
to
see
him
in
the
gunroom
with
a
common
purpose
after
easing
himself
into
a
chair
and
going
through
some
prefatory
huffing
and
puffing
goode
came
out
with
it
did
rand
believe
that
lane
fleming
had
really
been
murdered
and
was
he
investigating
fleming
death
after
all
i
have
always
believed
that
lane
fleming
was
murdered
rand
replied
i
also
believe
that
his
murderer
killed
arnold
rivers
as
well
i
am
investigating
the
rivers
murder
and
the
fleming
murder
may
be
considered
as
a
part
thereof
but
what
brings
you
around
to
discuss
that
now
did
you
learn
something
since
last
evening
that
leads
you
to
suspect
the
same
thing
well
not
exactly
but
this
afternoon
fred
dunmore
and
anton
varcek
came
to
my
office
separately
of
course
and
each
of
them
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
any
reason
to
suspect
that
the
uh
tragedy
was
actually
a
case
of
murder
both
had
the
impression
that
you
were
conducting
an
investigation
under
cover
of
your
work
on
the
pistol
collection
and
wanted
to
know
whether
fleming
or
i
had
employed
you
to
do
so
and
you
denied
it
giving
them
the
impression
that
fleming
had
rand
asked
i
hope
you
have
put
her
in
any
more
danger
than
she
is
now
by
doing
so
goode
looked
startled
colonel
rand
do
you
actually
mean
that
he
began
you
were
lane
fleming
attorney
and
board
chairman
of
his
company
rand
said
you
can
probably
imagine
why
he
was
killed
you
can
ask
yourself
just
how
safe
his
principal
heir
is
now
without
giving
goode
a
chance
to
gather
his
wits
he
pressed
on
well
what
your
opinion
about
fleming
death
after
all
you
did
go
out
of
your
way
to
create
a
false
impression
that
he
had
committed
suicide
goode
still
bewildered
by
rand
deliberately
cryptic
hints
and
a
little
frightened
had
the
grace
to
blush
at
that
i
admit
it
it
was
entirely
unethical
and
i
admit
that
too
he
said
but
well
i
buying
all
the
premix
stock
that
out
in
small
blocks
and
so
are
dunmore
and
varcek
we
all
felt
that
such
rumors
would
reduce
the
market
quotation
to
our
advantage
rand
nodded
i
picked
up
a
hundred
shares
the
other
day
myself
your
shenanigans
probably
chipped
a
little
off
the
price
i
had
to
pay
so
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
you
but
we
talking
about
murder
not
market
manipulation
did
either
varcek
or
dunmore
express
any
opinion
as
to
who
might
have
killed
fleming
the
outside
telephone
rang
before
goode
could
answer
rand
scooped
it
up
at
the
end
of
the
first
ring
and
named
himself
into
it
it
was
mick
mckenna
calling
well
we
checked
up
on
that
you
left
with
me
he
said
this
gunsmith
umholtz
refinished
it
for
rivers
last
summer
he
showed
the
man
who
was
to
see
him
the
entry
in
his
make
model
serials
and
all
oh
fine
and
did
you
get
anything
out
of
young
gillis
rand
asked
the
gun
was
in
rivers
shop
from
the
time
umholtz
rejuvenated
it
till
around
the
first
of
november
then
it
was
sold
but
he
does
know
who
to
he
did
sell
it
himself
rivers
must
have
i
assumed
that
that
why
he
still
alive
well
thanks
mick
the
case
is
getting
tighter
every
minute
you
have
had
any
trouble
yet
mckenna
asked
anxiously
how
the
whoozis
doing
about
as
you
might
expect
rand
told
him
mopping
his
face
again
thanks
for
that
too
he
hung
up
and
turned
back
to
goode
pardon
the
interruption
he
said
sergeant
mckenna
of
the
state
police
the
officer
who
made
the
arrest
on
walters
and
gwinnett
well
i
suppose
dunmore
and
varcek
are
each
trying
to
blame
the
other
he
said
well
yes
i
rather
got
that
impression
goode
admitted
and
which
one
do
you
like
for
the
murderer
or
have
you
picked
yours
yet
you
mean
yes
of
course
goode
said
slowly
it
must
have
been
one
or
the
other
but
i
ca
think
it
horrible
to
have
to
suspect
either
of
them
for
a
moment
he
stared
unseeingly
at
the
litter
of
pistols
on
the
desk
then
colonel
rand
lane
fleming
is
dead
and
nothing
either
of
us
can
do
will
bring
him
back
to
expose
his
murderer
certainly
wo
but
it
would
cause
a
scandal
that
would
rock
the
premix
company
to
its
very
foundations
it
might
even
disastrously
affect
the
market
as
a
whole
oh
come
rand
reproved
that
like
talking
about
starting
a
hurricane
with
a
fan
but
you
will
admit
that
it
would
have
a
dreadful
effect
on
premix
foods
goode
argued
it
would
probably
prevent
this
merger
from
being
consummated
look
here
he
said
urgently
i
do
know
how
much
gladys
fleming
is
paying
you
to
rake
all
this
up
but
i
gladly
double
her
fee
if
you
drop
it
and
confine
yourself
to
the
matter
of
the
collection
even
in
his
colossal
avarice
that
was
one
kind
of
money
jeff
rand
had
never
been
tempted
to
take
an
offer
of
that
sort
invariably
made
him
furious
at
the
moment
he
managed
to
choke
down
his
anger
but
he
rejected
goode
offer
in
a
manner
which
left
no
room
for
further
discussion
goode
rose
shaking
his
head
sadly
i
suppose
you
realize
he
said
sorrowfully
that
you
wrecking
a
corporation
one
in
which
you
yourself
are
a
stockholder
rand
brightened
and
the
biggest
wrecking
jobs
i
ever
did
before
were
a
couple
of
petrol
dumps
and
a
railroad
bridge
he
got
to
his
feet
along
with
the
lawyer
no
need
to
call
the
butler
i
let
you
out
myself
he
accompanied
goode
down
the
front
stairway
to
the
door
goode
was
still
gloomy
i
made
a
mistake
in
trying
to
bribe
you
he
said
but
ca
i
appeal
to
your
sense
of
fairness
do
you
want
to
inflict
serious
losses
on
innocent
investors
merely
to
avenge
one
crime
i
do
approve
of
murder
rand
told
him
least
of
all
to
paraphrase
clausewitz
as
an
extension
of
business
by
other
means
you
know
if
we
let
lane
fleming
killer
get
away
with
it
somebody
might
take
that
as
a
precedent
and
bump
you
off
to
win
a
lawsuit
sometime
ever
think
of
that
when
he
returned
to
the
gunroom
he
found
gladys
fleming
occupying
the
chair
lately
vacated
by
the
family
attorney
she
blew
a
at
him
in
greeting
as
he
entered
now
what
was
hump
goode
up
to
she
wanted
to
know
i
taking
too
much
on
myself
rand
evaded
maybe
i
should
have
turned
walters
over
for
trial
by
family
how
do
you
like
davies
by
the
way
oh
he
cute
gladys
told
him
one
of
your
operatives
is
he
now
what
in
the
world
gave
you
an
idea
like
that
he
asked
as
though
humoring
the
vagaries
of
a
child
well
i
suspected
something
of
the
sort
from
the
alacrity
with
which
you
produced
him
before
walters
was
out
of
the
house
she
said
and
nobody
could
be
as
perfect
a
stage
butler
as
he
is
but
what
really
convinced
me
was
coming
into
the
library
a
little
while
ago
and
finding
him
squatting
on
the
top
of
the
spiral
covering
humphrey
goode
with
a
small
but
particularly
automatic
rand
chuckled
what
did
you
do
oh
i
climbed
up
and
squatted
beside
him
she
replied
i
got
there
just
as
you
were
telling
goode
what
he
could
do
with
his
bribe
you
know
with
one
thing
and
another
goode
beginning
to
become
unamusing
she
smoked
in
silence
for
a
moment
i
ought
to
be
indignant
with
you
filling
my
house
with
spies
she
said
but
under
the
circumstances
afraid
i
thankful
instead
your
op
a
good
egg
by
the
way
he
on
his
way
to
bring
us
some
drinks
i
ought
to
be
sore
at
you
retaining
me
into
a
mess
like
this
and
telling
me
nothing
rand
told
her
what
was
the
idea
anyhow
you
wanted
me
to
investigate
your
husband
murder
all
along
did
you
i
i
had
a
thing
to
go
on
she
replied
i
was
afraid
if
i
came
out
and
told
you
what
i
suspected
that
you
think
it
was
just
another
case
of
feminine
and
dismiss
it
as
such
i
knew
it
was
an
accident
lane
did
have
accidents
with
guns
and
if
he
wanted
to
kill
himself
he
have
done
it
and
left
a
note
explaining
why
he
had
to
but
i
did
have
a
single
fact
to
give
you
i
thought
that
if
you
came
here
and
started
working
on
the
collection
you
find
something
you
should
have
taken
a
chance
and
told
me
what
you
suspected
rand
said
i
taken
a
lot
of
cases
on
flimsier
grounds
than
this
the
fact
is
you
practically
told
me
it
was
murder
when
you
were
talking
to
me
in
my
office
jeff
i
never
was
what
the
call
being
love
with
lane
she
continued
but
he
was
wonderful
to
me
he
gave
me
everything
a
girl
who
grew
up
in
a
apartment
over
a
fruit
store
could
want
and
then
somebody
killed
him
just
as
you
step
on
a
cockroach
because
he
got
in
the
way
of
a
business
deal
i
glad
to
be
able
to
spend
money
to
help
catch
whoever
did
it
it
wo
help
him
but
it
make
me
feel
a
lot
better
you
will
catch
him
wo
you
rand
nodded
i
do
know
whether
he
ever
go
to
trial
and
be
convicted
he
said
i
do
think
he
will
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
he
wo
get
away
with
it
tomorrow
i
think
the
lid
going
to
blow
off
maybe
you
better
be
away
from
home
when
it
does
take
nelda
and
geraldine
with
you
and
go
somewhere
there
likely
to
be
some
uproar
well
nelda
and
geraldine
and
i
are
going
to
church
in
the
morning
gladys
said
it
a
question
of
face
we
have
a
rented
pew
lane
was
quite
active
in
church
work
and
none
of
us
are
willing
to
let
ourselves
get
squeezed
out
of
it
we
all
go
even
geraldine
manages
to
drag
herself
to
the
lord
house
through
an
alcoholic
fog
and
we
have
to
be
back
in
time
for
dinner
it
would
look
funny
if
we
were
well
if
nothing
happened
by
the
time
you
get
back
i
want
you
to
talk
the
girls
into
going
somewhere
with
you
in
the
afternoon
and
stay
away
till
evening
and
do
get
the
idea
that
you
could
help
me
here
he
added
stopping
an
objection
i
know
what
i
talking
about
the
presence
of
any
of
you
here
would
only
delay
matters
and
make
it
harder
for
me
then
ritter
came
in
a
cigarette
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
carrying
a
tray
on
which
were
a
bottle
of
bourbon
a
bottle
of
scotch
a
siphon
and
a
couple
of
bottles
of
beer
chapter
the
was
empty
when
rand
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
taking
the
seat
he
had
occupied
the
evening
before
he
waited
until
ritter
came
out
of
the
kitchen
through
the
pantry
good
morning
colonel
rand
the
perfect
butler
greeted
him
unctuously
if
i
may
say
so
sir
you
a
bit
of
an
early
riser
none
of
the
family
is
up
yet
sir
rand
jerked
a
thumb
toward
the
kitchen
who
out
there
he
hissed
just
the
cook
frying
sausage
and
flipping
pancakes
premix
pancakes
of
course
the
maid
sleeps
out
she
has
gotten
here
yet
how
it
go
last
night
you
put
a
dummy
under
the
covers
and
sleep
on
the
floor
no
last
night
i
was
safe
the
is
due
till
this
morning
when
the
women
are
at
church
and
he
have
to
catch
me
and
the
together
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
ritter
asked
giving
an
hitch
at
his
i
can
stand
on
my
official
dignity
and
get
out
of
any
work
till
after
dinner
and
i
wo
have
any
buttling
to
do
till
the
women
get
home
from
church
case
varcek
and
dunmore
when
they
come
in
see
if
either
of
them
is
find
anything
last
night
ritter
shook
his
head
i
searched
varcek
lab
after
everybody
was
in
bed
and
i
searched
the
cars
in
the
garage
and
a
lot
of
other
places
i
did
find
them
whoever
he
is
the
chances
are
he
has
them
in
his
room
did
you
look
back
of
the
books
in
the
library
rand
asked
when
ritter
shook
his
head
he
continued
that
probably
where
they
are
not
that
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference
if
i
found
them
it
of
given
me
something
to
watch
then
i
know
when
the
fun
was
going
to
start
ritter
broke
off
suddenly
yes
sir
will
you
have
your
coffee
now
or
later
sir
gladys
entered
wearing
the
blue
tailored
outfit
she
had
worn
to
office
on
wednesday
at
ease
at
ease
she
laughed
dropping
into
her
chair
anything
new
rand
shook
his
head
we
have
to
wait
i
expecting
some
action
this
morning
i
hope
it
be
over
before
you
home
from
church
she
looked
at
him
seriously
jeff
you
using
yourself
as
she
said
are
you
more
or
less
he
knows
i
onto
him
he
pretty
sure
i
have
any
real
proof
yet
but
he
does
know
how
soon
i
will
have
he
realizes
that
i
him
the
way
i
did
walters
so
he
try
to
kill
me
before
i
pounce
and
when
he
does
he
convict
himself
what
he
realize
is
that
as
long
as
he
sits
tight
he
perfectly
safe
neither
of
them
mentioned
the
obvious
corollary
that
conviction
and
execution
would
be
almost
simultaneous
it
must
have
been
uppermost
in
gladys
mind
she
leaned
over
and
put
her
hand
on
rand
arm
jeff
would
it
help
any
if
i
stayed
home
instead
of
going
to
church
she
asked
i
a
pretty
fair
lane
taught
me
i
can
stay
over
ninety
at
slow
fire
and
in
the
eighties
at
if
i
hid
somewhere
with
a
target
pistol
absolutely
not
rand
vetoed
emphatically
i
not
saying
that
because
i
afraid
you
might
stop
a
slug
yourself
you
a
big
girl
now
you
can
take
your
own
chances
but
if
you
stayed
home
he
would
make
a
move
you
and
geraldine
and
nelda
have
to
be
out
of
the
house
before
he
feel
safe
coming
out
of
the
grass
watch
it
ritter
warned
yes
at
once
nelda
came
in
and
sat
down
ritter
held
her
chair
and
fussed
over
her
finding
out
what
she
wanted
to
eat
he
was
bringing
in
her
fruit
when
varcek
and
geraldine
entered
nelda
was
inquiring
if
rand
wanted
to
come
to
church
with
them
no
i
one
of
the
boys
the
chaplain
could
find
in
the
foxholes
rand
said
i
going
to
put
in
a
quiet
morning
on
the
collection
if
nobody
gets
murdered
or
arrested
in
the
meantime
that
is
geraldine
looked
woebegone
her
hands
were
trembling
my
god
do
i
have
a
hangover
she
moaned
walters
for
heaven
sake
fix
me
up
something
quick
then
she
saw
ritter
who
the
devil
are
you
she
demanded
where
walters
out
on
bail
rand
told
her
do
you
remember
oh
you
did
this
to
me
she
accused
walters
could
always
fix
me
up
in
the
morning
now
what
am
i
going
to
do
you
might
stop
drinking
her
husband
suggested
mildly
oh
just
stop
breathing
that
would
be
better
all
around
nelda
interposed
ritter
coughed
delicately
begging
your
pardon
but
i
always
rawther
fawncied
myself
for
an
expert
on
tonics
if
wait
a
moment
he
departed
on
his
errand
of
mercy
returning
shortly
with
a
highball
glass
filled
with
some
dark
potion
he
set
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
sufferer
and
poured
her
a
cup
of
coffee
now
just
try
this
take
it
gradually
if
i
may
suggest
attempt
to
gulp
it
it
quite
strong
geraldine
tasted
it
and
pulled
a
encouraged
by
ritter
she
managed
to
down
about
half
of
the
mixture
splendid
splendid
he
cheered
her
on
now
drink
your
coffee
and
then
finish
it
that
right
and
now
more
coffee
geraldine
struggled
through
with
the
black
draft
and
drank
the
second
cup
of
coffee
as
she
set
down
the
empty
cup
she
even
managed
to
smile
why
that
wonderful
she
lit
a
cigarette
what
is
it
i
feel
as
though
i
might
live
after
all
a
recipe
of
my
own
a
variant
on
the
old
prairie
oyster
but
without
the
raw
egg
which
i
consider
a
needless
embellishment
i
learned
it
in
the
household
of
a
former
employer
a
new
york
stockbroker
poor
man
he
did
himself
in
in
the
autumn
of
well
it
too
bad
you
wo
be
with
us
permanently
davies
nelda
said
your
recipe
seems
to
be
just
what
geraldine
needs
with
a
dash
of
prussic
acid
added
of
course
that
got
the
off
to
a
good
start
when
dunmore
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
sisters
were
stalking
one
another
through
the
jungle
poison
darts
back
and
forth
the
newcomer
sat
down
without
a
word
throughout
the
meal
he
and
varcek
treated
one
another
with
silent
and
hostile
suspicion
finally
gladys
looked
at
her
watch
and
called
a
truce
to
the
skirmishing
by
announcing
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
church
rand
left
the
room
with
the
ladies
in
the
hall
gladys
brushed
against
him
quickly
and
gripped
his
left
arm
do
be
careful
jeff
she
whispered
do
worry
i
will
rand
assured
her
then
he
turned
into
the
library
and
went
up
the
spiral
to
the
gunroom
while
the
three
women
went
down
to
the
garage
he
was
standing
at
the
window
as
the
big
packard
moved
out
onto
the
drive
nelda
was
at
the
wheel
and
gladys
beside
her
on
the
front
seat
raised
a
hand
in
the
salute
rand
gave
it
back
and
watched
the
car
swing
around
the
house
then
he
mopped
his
face
with
a
wad
of
kleenex
and
went
over
to
the
thermostat
turning
it
down
to
sixty
sitting
down
at
the
desk
he
dialed
humphrey
goode
number
on
the
private
outside
line
a
maid
answered
a
moment
later
he
was
talking
to
the
fleming
lawyer
rand
here
he
identified
himself
goode
i
been
thinking
over
our
conversation
of
last
evening
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
the
position
you
taking
in
the
matter
as
you
reminded
me
i
a
small
if
purely
speculative
stockholder
in
premix
myself
and
even
if
i
were
i
should
hate
to
be
responsible
for
undeserved
losses
by
innocent
investors
yes
goode
voice
fairly
shook
then
you
going
to
drop
the
investigation
no
goode
i
ca
do
that
but
i
believe
a
formula
could
be
evolved
which
would
keep
the
premix
company
and
its
affairs
out
of
it
in
fact
i
think
that
the
whole
question
of
the
death
of
lane
fleming
might
possibly
be
kept
in
the
background
would
that
satisfy
you
it
would
require
some
very
careful
manipulation
on
my
part
and
your
cooperation
but
see
here
if
you
investigating
the
death
of
fleming
how
can
that
be
kept
in
the
background
goode
wanted
to
know
the
murderer
of
lane
fleming
is
also
guilty
of
the
murder
of
arnold
rivers
rand
stated
i
know
that
positively
now
murder
is
punished
capitally
and
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
capital
punishment
is
that
it
can
be
inflicted
only
once
on
no
matter
how
many
counts
if
our
man
goes
to
the
chair
for
the
death
of
rivers
the
death
of
fleming
might
even
remain
an
accident
i
can
hardly
guarantee
that
i
have
my
agency
license
to
think
of
among
other
things
but
i
feel
reasonably
safe
in
saying
that
i
could
keep
the
premix
company
from
figuring
in
the
case
would
that
satisfy
you
it
most
certainly
would
colonel
rand
goode
voice
shook
even
more
are
you
sure
i
not
sure
of
anything
it
cost
the
premix
company
some
money
to
get
this
done
i
have
certain
expenses
for
one
thing
which
could
not
very
gracefully
be
itemized
and
i
will
have
to
have
your
cooperation
now
i
want
you
to
remain
at
home
where
i
can
reach
you
at
any
moment
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
call
you
later
he
listened
to
goode
babble
his
gratitude
for
a
while
then
terminated
the
call
and
hung
up
then
he
transferred
the
colt
to
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
picked
up
one
of
the
sheets
on
which
he
had
been
listing
the
collection
and
sat
for
almost
fifteen
minutes
pretending
to
study
it
keeping
his
eyes
shifting
from
the
hall
door
to
the
spiral
stairway
and
back
again
finally
the
hall
door
opened
and
anton
varcek
came
in
rand
half
rose
covering
the
czech
from
his
side
pocket
varcek
came
over
and
sat
down
in
an
armchair
near
the
desk
he
was
looking
more
than
ever
like
rudolf
hess
rudolf
hess
on
the
morning
of
the
beer
hall
putsch
colonel
rand
he
began
there
has
within
the
last
half
hour
been
a
most
important
development
i
am
at
a
loss
to
define
its
significance
but
its
importance
is
inescapable
rand
nodded
he
had
been
expecting
somebody
to
give
birth
to
an
important
development
the
steps
toward
gunfire
were
progressing
in
logical
series
well
he
smiled
encouragingly
what
happened
after
you
and
the
ladies
left
the
varcek
said
fred
dunmore
turned
to
me
and
apologized
for
harboring
unjust
suspicions
of
me
in
the
matter
of
lane
fleming
death
he
said
that
he
had
been
unable
to
understand
who
else
could
have
murdered
lane
until
you
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
house
could
have
been
entered
from
the
garage
and
the
gunroom
from
the
library
then
he
said
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
some
unnamed
gentleman
at
the
party
last
evening
and
had
learned
that
lane
had
discovered
that
humphrey
goode
was
deceiving
him
and
had
been
about
to
have
him
dismissed
from
his
position
with
the
company
and
to
sever
his
personal
connections
with
him
the
devil
now
rand
gave
a
good
imitation
of
surprise
what
sort
of
was
goode
up
to
fred
said
that
his
informant
told
him
that
lane
had
proof
that
goode
had
accepted
a
bribe
from
arnold
rivers
to
misconduct
the
suit
which
lane
was
bringing
against
rivers
about
a
pair
of
pistols
he
had
bought
from
rivers
it
seems
that
goode
was
rivers
attorney
also
and
had
been
involved
with
him
in
a
number
of
dishonest
transactions
although
the
connection
had
been
kept
secret
that
a
new
angle
now
rand
said
i
suppose
that
he
killed
rivers
in
order
to
prevent
the
latter
from
incriminating
him
why
did
fred
come
to
me
with
this
he
asked
eh
evidently
varcek
had
thought
of
that
why
i
suppose
he
was
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
repercussions
in
the
business
world
after
all
goode
is
our
board
chairman
and
maybe
he
thought
that
people
might
begin
thinking
that
the
murder
had
some
connection
with
the
affairs
of
the
company
that
possible
of
course
rand
agreed
and
what
your
own
attitude
colonel
rand
i
can
not
allow
these
facts
to
be
suppressed
the
czech
said
my
own
position
is
too
vulnerable
you
showed
me
that
except
for
the
fact
that
somebody
could
have
entered
the
house
through
the
garage
the
burden
of
suspicion
would
lie
on
me
and
fred
dunmore
well
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
with
it
rand
asked
yes
if
you
will
it
would
be
helping
yourself
also
i
believe
varcek
replied
fred
is
downstairs
now
in
the
library
i
suggest
that
you
and
i
go
down
and
have
a
talk
with
him
maybe
you
could
show
him
the
folly
of
trying
to
suppress
any
facts
concerning
lane
death
yes
that
would
be
both
foolish
and
dangerous
rand
got
to
his
feet
keeping
his
hand
on
the
colt
let
go
down
and
talk
to
him
now
they
walked
side
by
side
toward
the
spiral
rand
keeping
on
the
right
and
lagging
behind
a
little
lifting
the
stubby
revolver
clear
of
his
pocket
yet
in
spite
of
his
vigilance
it
happened
before
he
could
prevent
it
a
lance
of
yellow
fire
jumped
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
stairway
and
there
was
a
soft
cough
of
a
silenced
pistol
almost
lost
in
the
of
the
rand
felt
something
him
in
the
chest
almost
knocking
him
down
he
staggered
then
swung
up
the
colt
he
had
drawn
from
his
pocket
and
blazed
two
shots
into
the
stairway
there
was
a
clatter
and
the
sound
of
feet
descending
into
the
library
he
rushed
forward
revolver
poised
and
then
a
shot
boomed
from
below
followed
by
three
more
in
quick
succession
okay
jeff
ritter
voice
called
out
war
over
he
managed
somehow
to
get
down
the
steep
spiral
the
little
webley
scott
was
lying
on
the
bottom
step
he
pushed
it
aside
with
his
foot
and
cautioned
varcek
who
was
following
to
avoid
it
ritter
still
looking
like
the
perfect
butler
in
spite
of
the
beretta
in
his
hand
was
standing
in
the
hall
doorway
on
the
floor
midway
between
the
stairway
and
the
door
lay
fred
dunmore
his
tan
coat
and
vest
were
turning
dark
in
several
places
and
rand
own
detective
special
was
lying
a
few
inches
from
his
left
hand
he
came
in
here
and
shut
the
door
ritter
reported
i
could
follow
him
in
so
i
took
a
plant
in
the
hall
when
i
heard
you
blasting
upstairs
i
came
in
just
in
time
to
see
him
coming
down
you
winged
him
in
the
right
shoulder
he
dropped
the
and
he
had
your
gat
in
his
left
hand
when
he
saw
mine
he
threw
one
at
me
and
missed
i
gave
him
three
back
for
it
see
result
on
floor
he
have
gotten
away
if
you
had
been
on
the
job
he
told
ritter
then
he
picked
up
his
own
revolver
and
holstered
it
after
a
glance
which
assured
him
that
fred
dunmore
was
beyond
any
further
action
of
any
sort
he
laid
the
detective
special
on
the
floor
beside
him
you
did
all
right
dave
he
said
now
nobody
going
to
have
a
chance
to
bamboozle
a
jury
into
acquitting
him
he
thought
of
his
recent
conversation
with
humphrey
goode
you
did
just
all
right
he
repeated
so
it
was
fred
then
he
heard
varcek
behind
him
say
then
he
was
lying
about
this
evidence
against
goode
the
czech
came
over
and
stood
beside
rand
looking
down
at
the
body
of
his
late
but
why
did
he
tell
me
that
story
and
why
did
he
shoot
at
us
when
we
were
together
both
for
the
same
general
reason
rand
explained
about
the
two
pistols
and
the
planned
with
both
of
us
dead
you
be
the
murderer
and
i
be
a
martyr
to
and
he
be
in
the
clear
varcek
regarded
the
dead
man
with
more
distaste
than
surprise
evidently
his
experiences
in
hitler
europe
had
left
him
with
few
illusions
about
the
sanctity
of
human
life
or
the
extent
of
human
perfidy
ritter
holstered
the
beretta
and
got
out
a
cigarette
i
hope
you
did
leave
your
lighter
upstairs
he
told
rand
rand
produced
and
snapped
it
holding
the
flame
out
to
his
assistant
dave
he
lectured
the
perfect
butler
always
has
a
lighter
in
good
working
order
lighting
up
the
mawster
is
part
of
his
duties
remember
that
the
next
time
you
have
a
buttling
job
ritter
leaned
forward
for
the
light
dunmore
was
a
better
shot
with
his
right
hand
than
he
was
with
his
left
he
commented
he
did
come
within
a
yard
of
me
and
he
scored
a
center
on
you
right
through
the
necktie
rand
glanced
down
then
he
burst
into
a
roar
of
obscene
blasphemy
seven
dollars
and
fifty
cents
i
paid
for
that
tie
not
three
weeks
ago
he
concluded
does
your
grandmother
make
patchwork
quilts
if
she
does
she
can
have
it
my
god
varcek
stared
at
rand
unbelievingly
why
he
hit
you
wounded
only
in
the
necktie
rand
reassured
him
i
have
a
hole
in
my
shirt
too
he
reached
under
the
latter
garment
and
rummaged
as
though
to
evict
a
small
trespasser
when
he
brought
out
his
hand
he
was
holding
a
battered
bullet
he
held
it
out
to
show
to
varcek
and
ritter
sure
ritter
grinned
at
varcek
did
you
know
superman
i
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest
mick
mckenna
loaned
it
to
me
yesterday
rand
enlightened
varcek
i
never
wore
one
of
the
damn
things
before
and
if
i
can
help
it
i
never
wear
one
again
i
damn
near
stewed
alive
in
it
think
how
hot
you
be
right
now
if
you
had
been
wearing
it
ritter
reminded
him
then
you
knew
since
yesterday
that
he
would
do
this
varcek
asked
i
knew
one
or
the
other
of
you
would
rand
replied
i
had
quite
a
few
reasons
for
thinking
it
might
be
dunmore
and
one
good
one
for
not
suspecting
you
you
mean
my
dislike
for
firearms
that
could
have
been
feigned
or
it
could
have
been
overcome
rand
replied
i
mean
your
knowledge
of
biology
and
biochemistry
if
killed
lane
fleming
there
have
been
no
clumsy
business
of
fake
accidents
not
as
long
as
both
of
you
ate
at
the
same
table
have
just
died
an
unimpeachably
natural
death
he
turned
to
ritter
dave
i
going
upstairs
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
damned
coat
of
mail
i
wearing
while
i
doing
it
i
want
you
to
call
carter
tipton
at
the
jarrett
place
and
humphrey
goode
and
mick
mckenna
in
that
order
tell
goode
to
get
over
here
as
fast
as
he
can
and
come
up
to
my
room
tell
him
we
have
to
consider
ways
and
means
of
implementing
my
suggestion
to
him
chapter
in
the
month
which
followed
events
transpired
through
a
thickening
miasma
of
rumors
official
communiques
journalistic
conjectures
and
outright
fabrications
fitfully
lit
by
the
glare
of
bulking
with
strange
shapes
and
emitting
stranger
noises
there
were
the
portentous
rumblings
of
prepared
statements
and
the
hollow
thumps
of
denials
there
were
soft
murmurs
of
now
this
is
strictly
off
the
record
followed
by
sibilant
whispers
the
unseen
screws
of
political
pressure
creaked
and
whitewash
brushes
slurped
suavely
and
there
was
an
insistent
yammering
of
bewildered
and
unanswered
questions
fred
dunmore
really
had
killed
arnold
rivers
had
he
or
had
he
arnold
rivers
had
been
dunmore
or
had
dunmore
been
rivers
somebody
had
stolen
ten
or
was
it
thousand
dollars
worth
of
old
pistols
or
was
it
just
thousand
dollars
or
what
if
anything
had
been
stolen
was
somebody
being
framed
for
something
or
was
somebody
covering
up
for
somebody
or
what
and
was
there
something
funny
about
the
way
lane
fleming
got
killed
last
december
the
surviving
members
of
the
fleming
family
issued
a
few
noncommittal
statements
through
their
attorney
humphrey
goode
and
then
the
iron
curtain
slammed
down
mick
mckenna
gave
an
outraged
squawk
or
so
then
subsided
there
was
a
series
of
pronunciamentos
from
the
office
of
district
attorney
charles
farnsworth
all
full
of
abstractions
and
empty
of
meaning
the
reporters
converging
on
the
fleming
house
found
it
occupied
by
the
state
police
who
kept
them
at
bay
harry

he

wearing
a
suit
of
butler
livery
and
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
garage
talking
to
sergeant
mckenna
carter
tipton
and
farnsworth
the
exploited
this
scoop
for
all
it
was
worth
on
the
whole
the
rosemont
bayonet
murder
was
from
a
journalistic
standpoint
an
almost
complete
bust
there
had
been
no
arrest
no
hearing
no
protracted
trial
no
sensational
revelations
only
one
monolithic
fact
officially
attested
and
indisputable
loomed
out
of
the
murk
and
the
said

did
receive
the

at

did
so
act
in
defense
of
their
several
persons
and
finally
the
said

parker
dunmore
did
die

jefferson
davis

had
once
cost
the
loss
of
an
expensive
and
exposed
in
certain
journalistic
malpractices
verging
upon
blackmail
promptly
burst
into
print
with
an
indignant
editorial
entitled
by
the
terms
legalized
slaughter
and
flagrant
whitewash
were
used
and
mention
was
made
of
the
well
known
preference
of
a
certain
notorious
private
detective
for
the
procedure
of
cadaver
the
principal
result
of
this
outcry
was
to
persuade
an
important
new
belfast
manufacturer
who
had
hitherto
resisted
rand
sales
pressure
to
contract
with
the
agency
for
the
protection
of
his
payroll
deliveries
then
at
the
other
end
of
the
state
the
professor
of
moral
science
at
a
small
theological
seminary
caught
his
wife
in
with
one
of
the
students
and
opened
fire
upon
them
at
a
range
of
ten
feet
with
a

murder
already
pretty
well
withered
on
the

passed
quietly
into
limbo
summer
almost
a
month
before
its
official
opening
was
already
a
the
trees
were
in
full
leaf
and
invaded
by
nesting
birds
the
air
was
fragrant
with
flower
scents
and
the
mercury
column
of
the
thermometer
was
stretching
itself
up
toward
the
ninety
mark
they
were
all
outside
where
the
long
shadow
of
the
fleming
house
fell
across
the
lawn
and
driveway
gathered
about
the
five
parked
cars
the
new
fleming
butler
a
short
and
somewhat
globular
negro
with
a
complexion
and
an
air
of
affable
dignity
was
helping
pierre
jarrett
and
karen
lawrence
put
a
couple
of
cartons
and
a
tall
into
pierre
plymouth
colin
macbride
a
streamer
of
floating
back
over
his
shoulder
was
peering
into
his
to
check
the
stowage
of
his
own
cargo
while
his
son
malcolm
another
black
highlander
like
his
father
was
helping
philip
cabot
carry
a
big
laundry
hamper
full
of
pistols
to
his
cadillac
pierre
mother
and
the
trehearne
and
gladys
fleming
obviously
detached
from
the
bustle
of
preparations
were
standing
to
one
side
talking
and
rand
had
finished
helping
adam
trehearne
pack
the
last
container
of
his
share
of
the
fleming
collection
into
his
car
i
see
colin
about
ready
to
leave
and
i
in
his
way
trehearne
said
he
extended
his
hand
to
rand
no
need
hashing
over
how
we
all
feel
about
this
if
it
had
been
for
you
that
offer
of
kendall
would
have
had
us
stopped
as
dead
as
rivers
had
five
hundred
dollars
deader
in
fact
stephen
gresham
carrying
a
orange
crate
joined
him
setting
down
his
burden
his
wife
and
daughter
with
another
crate
between
them
halted
beside
him

stuff
later
jarrett
trehearne
and
gladys
came
over
one
by
one
the
rest
of
the
group
converged
upon
them
then
when
the
had
been
said
and
the
promises
to
meet
again
had
been
given
they
parted
one
by
one
the
cars
moved
slowly
down
the
driveway
to
the
road
only
gladys
and
rand
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
front
steps
and
the
butler
were
left
my
my
that
was
some
party
the
negro
chuckled
gathering
up
three
empty
pasteboard
cartons
and
telescoping
them
together
dinner
be
ready
in
about
half
an
hour
fleming
shall
i
go
mix
the
cocktails
now
yes
do
that
reuben
in
the
she
watched
the
servant
carry
the
discarded
containers
around
the
house
then
turned
to
rand
you
know
not
the
least
of
your
capabilities
is
your
knack
of
finding
on
short
notice
she
told
him
my
general
factotum
buck
pendexter
is
a
prominent
personage
in
new
belfast
colored
lodge
circles
rand
said
when
your
cook
and
maid
quit
on
you
the
day
of
the
all
i
had
to
do
was
phone
him
and
he
did
the
rest
he
got
out
his
cigarettes
offered
them
and
snapped
his
lighter
i
notice
you
having
cocktails
in
the
now
yes
i
suppose
in
time
i
stop
imagining
i
see
fred
dunmore
blood
on
the
library
floor
i
got
used
to
what
had
happened
in
the
gunroom
last
december
shall
we
go
in
she
asked
taking
rand
arm
the
cocktails
were
waiting
when
they
entered
the
off
the
the
butler
poured
for
them
and
put
the
glasses
and
the
shaker
on
a
low
table
by
a
lounge
i
afraid
dinner
going
to
be
a
little
later
than
i
said
fleming
he
apologized
things
were
kind
of
stirred
up
today
with
all
those
people
here
that
all
right
we
can
wait
she
replied
we
wo
need
anything
more
reuben
motioning
rand
down
on
the
lounge
beside
her
she
handed
him
a
glass
and
lifted
her
own
now
she
began
just
what
sort
of
skulduggery
has
been
going
on
as
of
friday
the
top
offer
for
the
collection
was
thousand
five
hundred
from
some
dealer
up
in
massachusetts
and
then
on
saturday
you
came
bounding
in
with
stephen
gresham
certified
check
for
thousand
and
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
late
unlamented
rivers
offer
of
thousand
straight
had
them
stopped
not
that
i
inclined
to
look
askance
at
an
extra
five
hundred
i
can
buy
a
new
hat
with
my
share
of
that
even
after
taxes
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
happened
and
i
might
add
that
only
one
of
many
things
i
like
to
know
the
client
is
entitled
to
a
full
report
rand
said
tasting
his
cocktail
it
was
a
vodka
martini
and
very
good
you
know
none
of
that
crowd
are
millionaires
adam
trehearne
who
the
plutocrat
of
the
bunch
is
so
filthy
rich
he
does
know
what
to
do
with
all
his
money
what
the
leave
of
it
and
the
rest
of
them
have
to
figure
pretty
closely
the
most
they
could
possibly
scratch
together
was
thousand
so
i
put
four
thousand
into
the
pot
myself
bringing
the
total
to
five
hundred
over
the
kendall
offer
and
hastily
declared
the
collection
sold
of
course
my
getting
into
it
meant
that
much
less
for
everybody
else
but
of
a
collection
is
better
than
no
pistols
at
all
i
imagine
colin
macbride
is
honing
up
his
for
me
because
i
got
that
big
whitneyville
walker
colt
but
what
the
hell
he
got
the
cased
pair
of
paterson
and
the
texas
with
the
why
i
think
the
division
was
fair
enough
gladys
said
they
agreed
to
take
your
valuation
had
they
and
all
that
and
comptometer
business
but
jeff
four
thousand
dollars
she
queried
you
only
got
five
from
me
and
you
ca
run
a
detective
agency
on
old
pistols
rand
grinned
as
he
set
down
his
empty
glass
gladys
refilled
it
from
the
shaker
my
dear
lady
that
five
thousand
i
unblushingly
accepted
from
you
was
only
part
of
it
he
confessed
there
was
also
a
fee
of
three
thousand
from
stephen
gresham
for
pulling
the
bloodhounds
of
the
office
off
his
back
in
the
matter
of
arnold
rivers
and
there
was
five
thousand
from
humphrey
goode
which
i
suppose
he
get
the
premix
company
to
repay
him
for
engineering
the
suppression
of
a
lot
of
facts
he
wanted
suppressed
and
finally
my
connection
with
this
business
brought
that
merger
to
my
attention
and
i
picked
up
a
hundred
shares
of
premix
at
and
now
i
have
two
hundred
shares
of
worth
about
thousand
which
i
can
report
for
my
income
tax
as
capital
gains
i
say
i
could
afford
to
treat
myself
to
a
few
old
pistols
for
my
collection
well
she
raised
both
eyebrows
over
that
do
anybody
tell
me
crime
does
pay
yes
in
my
ghoulish
way
i
generally
manage
to
bear
myself
in
mind
on
an
operation
like
this
i
make
no
secret
of
my
affection
for
money
he
lifted
his
glass
and
sipped
slowly
look
here
gladys
are
you
satisfied
with
the
way
this
was
handled
she
shrugged
i
should
be
when
i
started
out
as
lane
i
suppose
i
expected
things
to
end
somewhere
out
of
sight
in
a
nice
antiseptic
at
the
state
penitentiary
you
must
admit
that
that
business
in
the
library
was
really
bringing
it
home
there
no
question
that
you
got
the
man
who
killed
lane
and
if
you
had
never
have
been
at
peace
with
myself
and
i
suppose
all
that
chicanery
afterward
was
necessary
too
it
was
if
you
wanted
that
merger
to
go
through
and
unless
you
wanted
to
see
the
bottom
drop
out
of
your
premix
stock
rand
assured
her
if
the
true
facts
of
fleming
death
had
gotten
out
there
have
been
a
simply
hideous
stink
the
people
would
have
backed
out
of
that
merger
like
a
bear
out
of
an
active
you
know
what
the
situation
really
was
do
you
she
shook
her
head
i
know
wanted
to
get
control
of
the
premix
company
and
lane
refused
to
go
in
with
them
i
do
fully
understand
his
reasons
though
they
were
important
they
were
mainly
verbal
and
unrelated
to
actuality
rand
said
the
important
thing
is
that
he
did
refuse
and
wanted
that
merger
so
badly
that
it
could
be
tasted
in
every
ounce
of
food
they
sold
they
got
stephen
gresham
to
negotiate
it
for
them
and
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
reporting
it
to
be
an
impossibility
when
fred
dunmore
came
to
him
with
a
proposition
dunmore
said
he
thought
he
could
persuade
or
force
fleming
to
consent
and
he
wanted
a
contract
guaranteeing
him
a
with
at
forty
thousand
a
year
if
and
when
the
merger
was
accomplished
the
contract
was
duly
signed
about
the
first
of
last
november
well
good
lord
gladys
fleming
eyes
widened
when
did
you
hear
about
that
i
got
that
out
of
gresham
a
couple
of
days
after
the
when
it
was
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
rand
said
if
i
known
it
from
the
beginning
it
might
have
saved
me
some
work
not
much
though
gresham
was
just
as
badly
scared
about
the
facts
coming
out
as
goode
was
i
ca
prove
collusion
between
him
and
goode
but
gresham
was
helping
spread
the
suicide
story
too
nice
friends
lane
had
but
did
anybody
think
there
was
something
odd
about
that
accident
immediately
after
that
contract
was
signed
of
course
they
did
but
try
and
get
them
to
admit
it
even
to
themselves
nobody
likes
to
think
that
the
new
vice
president
of
the
company
murdered
his
way
into
the
position
so
everybody
assumed
the
attitudes
of
the
three
japanese
monkeys
and
made
respectable
noises
about
what
a
great
loss
fleming
was
to
the
business
world
and
how
lucky
dunmore
was
that
he
had
that
contract
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
for
a
moment
jeff
i
want
you
to
tell
me
exactly
how
everything
happened
she
said
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
know
yes
you
have
he
agreed
i
tell
you
the
whole
thing
what
i
actually
know
and
what
i
was
forced
to
guess
at
when
this
merger
idea
first
took
shape
last
summer
dunmore
saw
how
unalterably
opposed
to
it
fleming
was
and
he
began
wishing
him
out
of
the
way
some
time
later
he
decided
to
do
something
about
it
i
suppose
anton
varcek
gave
him
the
idea
in
the
first
place
with
his
jabber
about
the
danger
of
a
firearms
accident
dunmore
decided
he
fix
one
up
for
fleming
first
of
all
he
need
a
firearm
type
and
in
good
working
order
it
could
be
one
of
the
guns
in
the
collection
he
have
to
keep
it
loaded
all
the
time
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
use
it
he
could
take
a
weapon
out
of
the
collection
because
it
would
be
missed
and
he
could
load
one
and
hang
it
up
again
because
that
would
be
discovered
so
he
had
to
get
one
of
his
own
and
he
got
it
from
arnold
rivers
you
know
that
i
mean
that
not
just
a
guess
i
know
it
the
gun
he
got
from
rivers
was
a
colt
serial
number
rand
told
her
rivers
had
that
gun
last
summer
he
had
it
refinished
by
a
gunsmith
named
umholtz
after
umholtz
refinished
it
the
gun
was
in
rivers
shop
until
november
of
last
year
when
it
was
sold
by
rivers
personally
and
that
was
the
revolver
that
was
found
in
lane
fleming
hand
and
the
one
i
got
from
the
coroner
with
a
letter
vouching
for
the
fact
that
it
had
been
so
found
he
finished
his
cocktail
gladys
picked
up
the
shaker
mechanically
and
refilled
his
glass
now
we
have
dunmore
with
this
colt
loaded
with
powder
caps
and
bullets
from
the
ammunition
supply
in
the
gunroom
waiting
for
a
chance
to
use
it
and
also
he
has
this
contract
in
his
safe
deposit
box
at
the
bank
that
takes
care
of
the
weapon
and
the
motive
only
the
opportunity
is
needed
and
that
came
on
the
of
december
when
fleming
brought
home
that
confederate
leech
rigdon
he
had
just
bought
it
was
just
a
piece
of
luck
that
both
revolvers
were
alike
in
caliber
and
general
type
but
it
would
have
made
a
lot
of
difference
nobody
was
paying
much
attention
to
details
and
dunmore
was
on
the
scene
to
misdirect
any
attention
anybody
would
pay
to
anything
now
we
come
to
the
mechanics
of
the
thing
the
or
as
it
is
professionally
known
the
you
remember
what
happened
that
evening
nelda
had
gone
out
you
and
geraldine
were
listening
to
the
radio
in
the
parlor
over
there
varcek
had
gone
up
to
his
lab
fleming
was
alone
in
the
gunroom
working
on
his
new
revolver
and
fred
dunmore
said
he
was
going
to
take
a
bath
what
he
did
of
course
was
to
draw
a
tub
full
of
water
undress
put
on
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
hide
the
colt
under
the
bathrobe
and
then
go
across
the
hall
to
the
gunroom
where
he
found
fleming
sitting
on
that
cobbler
bench
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
the
leech
rigdon
so
he
fired
at
close
range
wiped
the
prints
off
the
colt
with
an
oily
rag
put
it
in
lane
fleming
right
hand
put
the
rag
in
his
left
grabbed
up
the
leech
rigdon
and
scuttled
back
to
his
bathroom
deadlatching
and
shutting
the
gunroom
door
as
he
went
out
this
last
of
course
was
a
delaying
tactic
to
give
him
time
to
establish
his
bathtub
alibi
he
lifted
the
cocktail
glass
to
his
lips
these
vodka
martinis
were
strong
and
three
of
them
before
dinner
was
leaning
way
over
backward
maintaining
the
tradition
of
the
private
eye
but
gladys
was
working
on
her
third
and
no
client
was
going
to
drink
him
under
so
in
the
privacy
of
his
bathroom
he
kicked
out
of
his
slippers
threw
off
his
robe
hid
the
leech
rigdon
probably
in
a
space
between
the
tub
and
the
wall
that
i
found
while
we
were
searching
the
house
the
night
before
the
shooting
of
dunmore
and
jumped
into
the
tub
there
to
await
developments
as
soon
as
he
heard
varcek
uproar
in
the
hall
he
could
emerge
dripping
bathwater
and
innocence
to
find
out
what
the
fuss
was
all
about
do
you
know
anything
about
something
called
general
semantics
he
asked
suddenly
yes
before
i
married
lane
i
went
around
with
a
radio
she
told
him
he
was
a
nice
boy
but
he
get
drunker
than
a
boiled
owl
about
once
a
month
and
weep
about
his
crimes
against
sanity
and
meaning
he
recite
long
excerpts
from
his
professional
creations
and
show
how
he
had
been
deliberately
objectifying
words
and
identifying
them
with
the
things
for
which
they
stood
and
confusing
orders
of
abstraction
and
juggling
multiordinal
meanings
he
was
going
to
lend
me
his
koran
a
book
called
and
and
then
he
took
a
job
with
an
ad
agency
in
chicago
and
i
got
married
and
rand
nodded
then
you
realize
that
the
word
is
not
the
thing
spoken
of
and
that
the
inference
is
not
the
description
and
that
we
can
not
know
about
anything
etcetera
he
added
hastily
like
a
papist
signing
himself
with
the
cross
well
some
considerable
disregard
of
these
principles
seems
to
have
existed
in
this
case
dunmore
is
seen
in
a
bathrobe
his
feet
bare
and
making
wet
tracks
on
the
floor
his
hair
wet
etcetera
straightaway
one
and
all
appear
to
have
assumed
that
he
was
in
the
tub
splashing
soapsuds
around
while
lane
fleming
was
being
shot
and
anton
varcek
who
can
be
taken
as
an
example
of
what
hayakawa
was
talking
about
when
he
spoke
of
people
behaving
like
scientists
inside
but
not
outside
their
laboratories
saw
lane
fleming
dead
with
an
object
labeled
in
his
hand
and
because
of
his
verbal
identifications
and
semantic
reactions
immediately
included
the
inference
of
an
accident
in
his
description
of
what
he
had
seen
that
was
just
an
extra
dividend
of
luck
for
dunmore
it
got
the
whole
crowd
of
you
thinking
in
terms
of
accidental
shooting
well
from
there
out
everything
would
have
been
a
wonderful
success
for
dunmore
except
for
one
thing
arnold
rivers
must
have
heard
somehow
that
lane
fleming
had
been
shot
with
a
confederate
that
he
bought
somewhere
that
day
and
that
the
revolver
was
in
the
hands
of
this
coroner
of
yours
so
arnold
with
his
big
chisel
well
ground
went
to
see
if
he
could
manage
to
get
it
out
of
the
coroner
for
a
few
dollars
and
when
he
saw
it
lo
it
was
the
colt
that
he
sold
to
dunmore
about
a
month
before
gladys
set
down
her
glass
so
she
said
things
begin
to
explain
themselves
you
may
say
so
indeed
rand
told
her
and
what
do
you
suppose
rivers
did
with
this
little
item
of
information
why
as
nearly
as
i
can
reconstruct
it
he
did
a
very
foolish
thing
he
tried
to
blackmail
a
man
who
had
committed
a
murder
he
told
fred
dunmore
he
keep
his
mouth
shut
about
the
colt
if
dunmore
would
get
him
the
fleming
collection
he
wanted
that
instead
of
cash
because
he
could
get
more
out
of
it
in
a
few
years
than
dunmore
could
ever
scrape
and
in
the
meantime
the
prestige
of
handling
that
collection
would
go
a
long
way
toward
repairing
his
rather
dilapidated
reputation
fred
should
have
bumped
him
off
right
then
it
would
have
been
the
cheapest
and
easiest
way
out
and
probably
be
alive
and
uncaught
today
if
he
had
but
he
was
willing
to
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
to
save
himself
the
trouble
and
that
what
he
told
you
rivers
had
offered
for
the
collection
the
ten
thousand
dunmore
told
you
rivers
was
willing
to
pay
was
really
the
ten
thousand
he
was
willing
to
pay
himself
to
keep
rivers
quiet
then
i
was
introduced
into
the
picture
and
as
you
know
one
of
my
first
acts
was
to
go
to
rivers
shop
and
sneer
scornfully
at
supposed
offer
of
ten
thousand
and
right
away
rivers
upped
it
to
thousand
you
recall
no
doubt
that
fleming
had
a
policy
one
of
these
partnership
mutual
policies
which
gave
both
dunmore
and
varcek
exactly
thousand
apiece
i
assume
that
rivers
had
found
out
about
that
i
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
peculiar
that
rivers
would
jump
his
own
offer
up
without
knowing
what
anybody
else
was
offering
for
the
collection
i
see
now
that
it
was
his
own
money
he
was
being
so
generous
with
and
there
was
another
incident
while
i
was
at
shop
that
piqued
my
curiosity
rivers
had
in
his
shop
a
leech
rigdon
revolver
and
i
had
been
informed
that
it
was
a
revolver
of
that
type
that
fleming
had
brought
home
the
evening
he
was
killed
i
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
curious
that
two
confederate
arms
of
the
same
type
and
make
should
show
up
this
far
north
but
my
main
idea
in
buying
it
was
the
possibility
that
i
might
use
it
in
some
way
as
circumstances
would
permit
to
throw
a
scare
into
somebody
rivers
was
quite
willing
to
let
me
have
it
until
he
found
out
that
i
would
be
staying
at
this
house
and
then
he
tried
to
back
out
of
the
sale
and
offered
me
dollars
credit
on
anything
else
in
the
shop
if
i
return
it
to
him
well
i
known
that
fleming
had
been
about
to
start
suit
against
rivers
over
a
crooked
deal
rivers
had
put
over
on
him
and
i
knew
that
if
fleming
death
had
been
murder
there
had
been
a
substitution
of
revolvers
so
i
showed
the
gun
i
bought
from
rivers
to
philip
cabot
who
had
seen
the
revolver
fleming
had
bought
and
he
recognized
it
it
has
been
established
just
how
rivers
got
the
leech
rigdon
and
never
will
be
the
only
people
who
knew
were
rivers
and
dunmore
and
both
are
in
the
proverbial
class
of
i
assume
that
dunmore
gave
it
to
rivers
as
a
sort
of
down
payment
on
rivers
silence
and
to
get
rid
of
it
well
you
remember
dunmore
angry
incredulity
when
i
told
him
that
rivers
was
offering
thousand
instead
of
ten
thousand
one
would
have
thought
on
the
face
of
it
that
he
would
have
been
glad
as
nelda
husband
he
would
share
in
the
higher
price
being
paid
for
the
collection
but
when
you
realize
that
rivers
was
buying
the
collection
out
of
dunmore
pocket
his
reaction
becomes
quite
understandable
i
daresay
i
signed
arnold
rivers
right
there
i
bet
your
conscience
bothers
you
about
that
gladys
remarked
oh
sure
it
been
gnawing
hell
out
of
me
ever
since
rand
told
her
cheerfully
but
right
away
dunmore
decided
to
kill
rivers
he
called
him
on
the
phone
as
soon
as
he
left
the
table
here
i
speaking
by
the
book
i
walked
in
on
him
in
the
gunroom
as
he
was
completing
the
call
though
i
did
know
it
at
the
time
and
arranged
to
see
him
that
evening
probably
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
dealing
with
the
jeff
rand
menace
for
an
ostensible
reason
so
that
night
dunmore
killed
rivers
with
a
bayonet
and
here
we
have
some
more
aristotelian
confusion
of
orders
of
abstraction
the
bayonet
is
defined
verbally
as
a
weapon
so
farnsworth
and
mick
mckenna
and
the
rest
of
them
bemused
themselves
with
suspects
like
stephen
gresham
and
pierre
jarrett
and
ignored
dunmore
who
never
had
an
hour
military
training
in
his
life
i
like
to
check
up
on
what
dunmore
had
been
seeing
in
the
week
or
so
before
the
killing
i
bet
anything
he
been
to
one
of
these
and
speaking
of
confusing
orders
of
abstraction
mick
mckenna
and
his
merry
men
pulled
a
classic
in
that
line
they
saw
dunmore
automobile
verbally
defined
as
a
plymouth
coupé
in
rivers
drive
at
the
estimated
time
of
the
murder
pierre
jarrett
has
a
car
of
that
sort
so
they
included
the
inferential
idea
of
pierre
jarrett
ownership
of
the
car
so
described
well
that
about
all
there
is
to
it
of
course
i
showed
fred
dunmore
the
leech
rigdon
and
told
him
it
was
the
gun
i
gotten
from
the
coroner
that
was
all
he
needed
to
tell
him
that
i
was
onto
the
murder
and
probably
onto
him
as
the
murderer
but
he
had
evidently
assumed
that
already
that
was
after
he
assembled
my
and
that
automatic
and
was
planning
to
me
and
anton
varcek
at
that
he
have
probably
killed
me
if
i
had
been
wearing
that
bulletproof
vest
of
mckenna
i
owe
mick
for
my
life
i
have
to
buy
him
a
drink
sometime
to
square
that
well
how
about
walters
and
the
pistols
he
stole
gladys
asked
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it
no
it
was
a
result
of
fleming
death
of
course
i
understand
that
the
situation
here
had
deteriorated
rather
abruptly
after
death
walters
was
about
fed
up
on
the
way
things
were
here
and
he
was
going
to
hand
in
his
notice
then
he
decided
that
he
ought
to
have
a
stake
to
tide
him
over
till
he
could
get
another
buttling
job
so
he
started
higrading
the
collection
gladys
nodded
i
suppose
he
decided
after
lane
death
that
he
owe
anybody
here
anything
too
bad
he
did
wait
though
the
situation
has
remedied
itself
and
that
something
else
i
owe
you
yes
i
noticed
that
there
was
nobody
here
but
you
rand
mentioned
oh
anton
gone
to
new
york
the
rockefeller
foundation
is
financing
the
major
part
of
his
research
work
and
he
well
enough
off
to
finance
the
rest
himself
geraldine
went
with
him
nelda
is
still
recuperating
from
the
shock
of
her
sudden
bereavement
at
a
sanatorium
i
understand
there
a
very
young
doctor
there
and
been
talking
about
going
to
new
york
herself
in
order
as
she
puts
it
to
lead
her
own
life
i
do
know
whether
she
was
afraid
i
be
a
restraining
influence
or
a
dangerous
competitor
but
she
feels
that
her
own
life
could
be
best
led
away
from
here
she
set
down
her
glass
and
leaned
back
comfortably
peace
it
wonderful
reuben
the
gingerbread
butler
appeared
in
the
doorway
dinner
served
now
fleming
he
announced
rand
rose
and
gladys
took
his
arm
together
they
went
into
the
