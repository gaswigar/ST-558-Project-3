i
bid
me
and
i
shall
gather
my
fruits
to
bring
them
in
full
baskets
into
your
courtyard
though
some
are
lost
and
some
not
ripe
for
the
season
grows
heavy
with
its
fulness
and
there
is
a
plaintive
shepherd
pipe
in
the
shade
bid
me
and
i
shall
set
sail
on
the
river
the
march
wind
is
fretful
fretting
the
languid
waves
into
murmurs
the
garden
has
yielded
its
all
and
in
the
weary
hour
of
evening
the
call
comes
from
your
house
on
the
shore
in
the
sunset
ii
my
life
when
young
was
like
a
flower
a
flower
that
loosens
a
petal
or
two
from
her
abundance
and
never
feels
the
loss
when
the
spring
breeze
comes
to
beg
at
her
door
now
at
the
end
of
youth
my
life
is
like
a
fruit
having
nothing
to
spare
and
waiting
to
offer
herself
completely
with
her
full
burden
of
sweetness
iii
is
summer
festival
only
for
fresh
blossoms
and
not
also
for
withered
leaves
and
faded
flowers
is
the
song
of
the
sea
in
tune
only
with
the
rising
waves
does
it
not
also
sing
with
the
waves
that
fall
jewels
are
woven
into
the
carpet
where
stands
my
king
but
there
are
patient
clods
waiting
to
be
touched
by
his
feet
few
are
the
wise
and
the
great
who
sit
by
my
master
but
he
has
taken
the
foolish
in
his
arms
and
made
me
his
servant
for
ever
iv
i
woke
and
found
his
letter
with
the
morning
i
do
not
know
what
it
says
for
i
can
not
read
i
shall
leave
the
wise
man
alone
with
his
books
i
shall
not
trouble
him
for
who
knows
if
he
can
read
what
the
letter
says
let
me
hold
it
to
my
forehead
and
press
it
to
my
heart
when
the
night
grows
still
and
stars
come
out
one
by
one
i
will
spread
it
on
my
lap
and
stay
silent
the
rustling
leaves
will
read
it
aloud
to
me
the
rushing
stream
will
chant
it
and
the
seven
wise
stars
will
sing
it
to
me
from
the
sky
i
can
not
find
what
i
seek
i
can
not
understand
what
i
would
learn
but
this
unread
letter
has
lightened
my
burdens
and
turned
my
thoughts
into
songs
v
a
handful
of
dust
could
hide
your
signal
when
i
did
not
know
its
meaning
now
that
i
am
wiser
i
read
it
in
all
that
hid
it
before
it
is
painted
in
petals
of
flowers
waves
flash
it
from
their
foam
hills
hold
it
high
on
their
summits
i
had
my
face
turned
from
you
therefore
i
read
the
letters
awry
and
knew
not
their
meaning
vi
where
roads
are
made
i
lose
my
way
in
the
wide
water
in
the
blue
sky
there
is
no
line
of
a
track
the
pathway
is
hidden
by
the
birds
wings
by
the
by
the
flowers
of
the
wayfaring
seasons
and
i
ask
my
heart
if
its
blood
carries
the
wisdom
of
the
unseen
way
vii
alas
i
can
not
stay
in
the
house
and
home
has
become
no
home
to
me
for
the
eternal
stranger
calls
he
is
going
along
the
road
the
sound
of
his
footfall
knocks
at
my
breast
it
pains
me
the
wind
is
up
the
sea
is
moaning
i
leave
all
my
cares
and
doubts
to
follow
the
homeless
tide
for
the
stranger
calls
me
he
is
going
along
the
road
viii
be
ready
to
launch
forth
my
heart
and
let
those
linger
who
must
for
your
name
has
been
called
in
the
morning
sky
wait
for
none
the
desire
of
the
bud
is
for
the
night
and
dew
but
the
blown
flower
cries
for
the
freedom
of
light
burst
your
sheath
my
heart
and
come
forth
ix
when
i
lingered
among
my
hoarded
treasure
i
felt
like
a
worm
that
feeds
in
the
dark
upon
the
fruit
where
it
was
born
i
leave
this
prison
of
decay
i
care
not
to
haunt
the
mouldy
stillness
for
i
go
in
search
of
everlasting
youth
i
throw
away
all
that
is
not
one
with
my
life
nor
as
light
as
my
laughter
i
run
through
time
and
o
my
heart
in
your
chariot
dances
the
poet
who
sings
while
he
wanders
x
you
took
my
hand
and
drew
me
to
your
side
made
me
sit
on
the
high
seat
before
all
men
till
i
became
timid
unable
to
stir
and
walk
my
own
way
doubting
and
debating
at
every
step
lest
i
should
tread
upon
any
thorn
of
their
disfavour
i
am
freed
at
last
the
blow
has
come
the
drum
of
insult
sounded
my
seat
is
laid
low
in
the
dust
my
paths
are
open
before
me
my
wings
are
full
of
the
desire
of
the
sky
i
go
to
join
the
shooting
stars
of
midnight
to
plunge
into
the
profound
shadow
i
am
like
the
cloud
of
summer
that
having
cast
off
its
crown
of
gold
hangs
as
a
sword
the
thunderbolt
upon
a
chain
of
lightning
in
desperate
joy
i
run
upon
the
dusty
path
of
the
despised
i
draw
near
to
your
final
welcome
the
child
finds
its
mother
when
it
leaves
her
womb
when
i
am
parted
from
you
thrown
out
from
your
household
i
am
free
to
see
your
face
xi
it
decks
me
only
to
mock
me
this
jewelled
chain
of
mine
it
bruises
me
when
on
my
neck
it
strangles
me
when
i
struggle
to
tear
it
off
it
grips
my
throat
it
chokes
my
singing
could
i
but
offer
it
to
your
hand
my
lord
i
would
be
saved
take
it
from
me
and
in
exchange
bind
me
to
you
with
a
garland
for
i
am
ashamed
to
stand
before
you
with
this
jewelled
chain
on
my
neck
xii
far
below
flowed
the
jumna
swift
and
clear
above
frowned
the
jutting
bank
hills
dark
with
the
woods
and
scarred
with
the
torrents
were
gathered
around
govinda
the
great
sikh
teacher
sat
on
the
rock
reading
scriptures
when
raghunath
his
disciple
proud
of
his
wealth
came
and
bowed
to
him
and
said
i
have
brought
my
poor
present
unworthy
of
your
acceptance
thus
saying
he
displayed
before
the
teacher
a
pair
of
gold
bangles
wrought
with
costly
stones
the
master
took
up
one
of
them
twirling
it
round
his
finger
and
the
diamonds
darted
shafts
of
light
suddenly
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
rolled
down
the
bank
into
the
water
alas
screamed
raghunath
and
jumped
into
the
stream
the
teacher
set
his
eyes
upon
his
book
and
the
water
held
and
hid
what
it
stole
and
went
its
way
the
daylight
faded
when
raghunath
came
back
to
the
teacher
tired
and
dripping
he
panted
and
said
i
can
still
get
it
back
if
you
show
me
where
it
fell
the
teacher
took
up
the
remaining
bangle
and
throwing
it
into
the
water
said
it
is
there
xiii
to
move
is
to
meet
you
every
moment
it
is
to
sing
to
the
falling
of
your
feet
he
whom
your
breath
touches
does
not
glide
by
the
shelter
of
the
bank
he
spreads
a
reckless
sail
to
the
wind
and
rides
the
turbulent
water
he
who
throws
his
doors
open
and
steps
onward
receives
your
greeting
he
does
not
stay
to
count
his
gain
or
to
mourn
his
loss
his
heart
beats
the
drum
for
his
march
for
that
is
to
march
with
you
every
step
xiv
my
portion
of
the
best
in
this
world
will
come
from
your
hands
such
was
your
promise
therefore
your
light
glistens
in
my
tears
i
fear
to
be
led
by
others
lest
i
miss
you
waiting
in
some
road
corner
to
be
my
guide
i
walk
my
own
wilful
way
till
my
very
folly
tempts
you
to
my
door
for
i
have
your
promise
that
my
portion
of
the
best
in
this
world
will
come
from
your
hands
xv
your
speech
is
simple
my
master
but
not
theirs
who
talk
of
you
i
understand
the
voice
of
your
stars
and
the
silence
of
your
trees
i
know
that
my
heart
would
open
like
a
flower
that
my
life
has
filled
itself
at
a
hidden
fountain
your
songs
like
birds
from
the
lonely
land
of
snow
are
winging
to
build
their
nests
in
my
heart
against
the
warmth
of
its
april
and
i
am
content
to
wait
for
the
merry
season
xvi
they
knew
the
way
and
went
to
seek
you
along
the
narrow
lane
but
i
wandered
abroad
into
the
night
for
i
was
ignorant
i
was
not
schooled
enough
to
be
afraid
of
you
in
the
dark
therefore
i
came
upon
your
doorstep
unaware
the
wise
rebuked
me
and
bade
me
be
gone
for
i
had
not
come
by
the
lane
i
turned
away
in
doubt
but
you
held
me
fast
and
their
scolding
became
louder
every
day
xvii
i
brought
out
my
earthen
lamp
from
my
house
and
cried
come
children
i
will
light
your
path
the
night
was
still
dark
when
i
returned
leaving
the
road
to
its
silence
crying
light
me
o
fire
for
my
earthen
lamp
lies
broken
in
the
dust
xviii
no
it
is
not
yours
to
open
buds
into
blossoms
shake
the
bud
strike
it
it
is
beyond
your
power
to
make
it
blossom
your
touch
soils
it
you
tear
its
petals
to
pieces
and
strew
them
in
the
dust
but
no
colours
appear
and
no
perfume
ah
it
is
not
for
you
to
open
the
bud
into
a
blossom
he
who
can
open
the
bud
does
it
so
simply
he
gives
it
a
glance
and
the
stirs
through
its
veins
at
his
breath
the
flower
spreads
its
wings
and
flutters
in
the
wind
colours
flush
out
like
the
perfume
betrays
a
sweet
secret
he
who
can
open
the
bud
does
it
so
simply
xix
sudâs
the
gardener
plucked
from
his
tank
the
last
lotus
left
by
the
ravage
of
winter
and
went
to
sell
it
to
the
king
at
the
palace
gate
there
he
met
a
traveller
who
said
to
him
ask
your
price
for
the
last
lotus
i
shall
offer
it
to
lord
buddha
sudâs
said
if
you
pay
one
golden
it
will
be
yours
the
traveller
paid
it
at
that
moment
the
king
came
out
and
he
wished
to
buy
the
flower
for
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
lord
buddha
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
lay
at
his
feet
the
lotus
that
bloomed
in
winter
when
the
gardener
said
he
had
been
offered
a
golden
mâshâ
the
king
offered
him
ten
but
the
traveller
doubled
the
price
the
gardener
being
greedy
imagined
a
greater
gain
from
him
for
whose
sake
they
were
bidding
he
bowed
and
said
i
can
not
sell
this
lotus
in
the
hushed
shade
of
the
mango
grove
beyond
the
city
wall
sudâs
stood
before
lord
buddha
on
whose
lips
sat
the
silence
of
love
and
whose
eyes
beamed
peace
like
the
morning
star
of
the
autumn
sudâs
looked
in
his
face
and
put
the
lotus
at
his
feet
and
bowed
his
head
to
the
dust
buddha
smiled
and
asked
what
is
your
wish
my
son
sudâs
cried
the
least
touch
of
your
feet
xx
make
me
thy
poet
o
night
veiled
night
there
are
some
who
have
sat
speechless
for
ages
in
thy
shadow
let
me
utter
their
songs
take
me
up
on
thy
chariot
without
wheels
running
noiselessly
from
world
to
world
thou
queen
in
the
palace
of
time
thou
darkly
beautiful
many
a
questioning
mind
has
stealthily
entered
thy
courtyard
and
roamed
through
thy
lampless
house
seeking
for
answers
from
many
a
heart
pierced
with
the
arrow
of
joy
from
the
hands
of
the
unknown
have
burst
forth
glad
chants
shaking
the
darkness
to
its
foundation
those
wakeful
souls
gaze
in
the
starlight
in
wonder
at
the
treasure
they
have
suddenly
found
make
me
their
poet
o
night
the
poet
of
thy
fathomless
silence
xxi
i
will
meet
one
day
the
life
within
me
the
joy
that
hides
in
my
life
though
the
days
perplex
my
path
with
their
idle
dust
i
have
known
it
in
glimpses
and
its
fitful
breath
has
come
upon
me
making
my
thoughts
fragrant
for
a
while
i
will
meet
one
day
the
joy
without
me
that
dwells
behind
the
screen
of
light
and
will
stand
in
the
overflowing
solitude
where
all
things
are
seen
as
by
their
creator
xxii
this
autumn
morning
is
tired
with
excess
of
light
and
if
your
songs
grow
fitful
and
languid
give
me
your
flute
awhile
i
shall
but
play
with
it
as
the
whim
takes
me
now
take
it
on
my
lap
now
touch
it
with
my
lips
now
keep
it
by
my
side
on
the
grass
but
in
the
solemn
evening
stillness
i
shall
gather
flowers
to
deck
it
with
wreaths
i
shall
fill
it
with
fragrance
i
shall
worship
it
with
the
lighted
lamp
then
at
night
i
shall
come
to
you
and
give
you
back
your
flute
you
will
play
on
it
the
music
of
midnight
when
the
lonely
crescent
moon
wanders
among
the
stars
xxiii
the
poet
mind
floats
and
dances
on
the
waves
of
life
amidst
the
voices
of
wind
and
water
now
when
the
sun
has
set
and
the
darkened
sky
draws
upon
the
sea
like
drooping
lashes
upon
a
weary
eye
it
is
time
to
take
away
his
pen
and
let
his
thoughts
sink
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
amid
the
eternal
secret
of
that
silence
xxiv
the
night
is
dark
and
your
slumber
is
deep
in
the
hush
of
my
being
wake
o
pain
of
love
for
i
know
not
how
to
open
the
door
and
i
stand
outside
the
hours
wait
the
stars
watch
the
wind
is
still
the
silence
is
heavy
in
my
heart
wake
love
wake
brim
my
empty
cup
and
with
a
breath
of
song
ruffle
the
night
xxv
the
bird
of
the
morning
sings
whence
has
he
word
of
the
morning
before
the
morning
breaks
and
when
the
dragon
night
still
holds
the
sky
in
its
cold
black
coils
tell
me
bird
of
the
morning
how
through
the
twofold
night
of
the
sky
and
the
leaves
he
found
his
way
into
your
dream
the
messenger
out
of
the
east
the
world
did
not
believe
you
when
you
cried
the
sun
is
on
his
way
the
night
is
no
more
o
sleeper
awake
bare
your
forehead
waiting
for
the
first
blessing
of
light
and
sing
with
the
bird
of
the
morning
in
glad
faith
xxvi
the
beggar
in
me
lifted
his
lean
hands
to
the
starless
sky
and
cried
into
night
ear
with
his
hungry
voice
his
prayers
were
to
the
blind
darkness
who
lay
like
a
fallen
god
in
a
desolate
heaven
of
lost
hopes
the
cry
of
desire
eddied
round
a
chasm
of
despair
a
wailing
bird
circling
its
empty
nest
but
when
morning
dropped
anchor
at
the
rim
of
the
east
the
beggar
in
me
leapt
and
cried
blessed
am
i
that
the
deaf
night
denied
me
that
its
coffer
was
empty
he
cried
o
life
o
light
you
are
precious
and
precious
is
the
joy
that
at
last
has
known
you
xxvii
sanâtan
was
telling
his
beads
by
the
ganges
when
a
brahmin
in
rags
came
to
him
and
said
help
me
i
am
poor
my
is
all
that
is
my
own
said
sanâtan
i
have
given
away
everything
i
had
but
my
lord
shiva
came
to
me
in
my
dreams
said
the
brahmin
and
counselled
me
to
come
to
you
sanâtan
suddenly
remembered
he
had
picked
up
a
stone
without
price
among
the
pebbles
on
the
and
thinking
that
some
one
might
need
it
hid
it
in
the
sands
he
pointed
out
the
spot
to
the
brahmin
who
wondering
dug
up
the
stone
the
brahmin
sat
on
the
earth
and
mused
alone
till
the

sent

forth
into

went
from

many

when
her

she
was
robbed
at

therefore
when

claimed

i
would
hide
myself
leaving
my
debts
unpaid
i
fled
and
fled
behind
my

work

my
night
dreams

his
claims
followed
me
at

drew
thus
i
came

i
am
known
to
him

no
place
left

asked
you

under

they
flock
round
him

unheeded
the

vexed
at

went
to

narottam
sat
on

asked
him
father
why
leave
my
temple
of
the
golden
dome
and
sit
on
the
dust
outside
to
preach
god
love
because

is
not

the

said
do
you

twenty

making
of
that
marvel
of

it
was
consecrated
to

with
costly
rites
yes
i
know
it
answered
narottam
it
was
in
that
year
when
thousands
of
your
people
whose
houses
had
been
burned
stood
vainly
asking
for
help
at
your
door
and
god
said
poor
creature
who
can
give
no
shelter
to
his
brothers
would
build
my
house
and
he
took
his
place
with
the
shelterless
under
the
trees
by
the
road
and
that
golden
bubble
is
empty
of
all
but
hot
vapour
of
pride
the

cried
in
anger
leave
my

calmly

yes
banish
me

reviled
her

gleam

bronze
dome
of
the
palace
tower
deep
shadows
settled
in
street
corners
the
bustle
of

city

hushed
the
gong
at
the
temple

announced
the
time
of
the
evening
prayer
in
the
dark
of
the
autumn
evening
deep
as
a
limpid
lake
stars
throbbed
with
light
when
the
guards
of
the
palace
garden
were
startled
to
see
through
the
trees
a
row
of
lamps
burning
at
the
shrine
of
buddha

ran
with
their
swords
unsheathed
crying
who
are
you
foolish

reckless
of
death

a
sweet
voice
the
servant
of
lord
buddha
the
next
moment
her
heart
blood
coloured
the
cold
marble
with
its
red
and
in

still
hour
of
stars
died
the
light
of
the
last
lamp
of
worship
at
the
foot
of
the
shrine

the
day
that
stands
between
you
and
me
makes
her
last
bow
of
farewell
the
night
draws
her
veil
over
her
face
and
hides
the
one
lamp
burning
in
my
chamber
your
dark
servant
comes
noiselessly
and
spreads
the
bridal
carpet
for
you
to
take
your
seat
there
alone
with
me
in
the
wordless
silence
till
night
is
done
xlv
my
night
has
passed
on
the
bed
of
sorrow
and
my
eyes
are
tired
my
heavy
heart
is
not
yet
ready
to
meet
morning
with
its
crowded
joys
draw
a
veil
over
this
naked
light
beckon
aside
from
me
this
glaring
flash
and
dance
of
life
let
the
mantle
of
tender
darkness
cover
me
in
its
folds
and
cover
my
pain
awhile
from
the
pressure
of
the
world
xlvi
the
time
is
past
when
i
could
repay
her
for
all
that
i
received
her
night
has
found
its
morning
and
thou
hast
taken
her
to
thy
arms
and
to
thee
i
bring
my
gratitude
and
my
gifts
that
were
for
her
for
all
hurts
and
offences
to
her
i
come
to
thee
for
forgiveness
i
offer
to
thy
service
those
flowers
of
my
love
that
remained
in
bud
when
she
waited
for
them
to
open
xlvii
i
found
a
few
old
letters
of
mine
carefully
hidden
in
her
box
a
few
small
toys
for
her
memory
to
play
with
with
a
timorous
heart
she
tried
to
steal
these
trifles
from
time
turbulent
stream
and
said
these
are
mine
only
ah
there
is
no
one
now
to
claim
them
who
can
pay
their
price
with
loving
care
yet
here
they
are
still
surely
there
is
love
in
this
world
to
save
her
from
utter
loss
even
like
this
love
of
hers
that
saved
these
letters
with
such
fond
care

you

away

dusty
fragments
of
the
hours

the
empty
jars

all
that
has
been
neglected

the
inner
door
of
the
shrine

the
candle

us
meet
there
in
silence

pain
was
great
when
the
strings
were
being
tuned

your
music
and
let
me
forget
the
pain
let
me
feel
in
beauty
what
you
had
in
your
mind
through
those
pitiless
days
the
waning
night
lingers
at
my
doors
let
her
take
her
leave
in
songs
pour
your
heart
into
my
life
strings
my
master
in
tunes
that
descend
from
your
stars

in
the
lightning
flash
of
a
moment

have
seen
the
immensity
of
your
creation
in
my
life

through
many
a
death
from
world
to
world
i
weep
at
my
unworthiness
when
i
see
my
life
in
the
hands
of
the
unmeaning
hours
but
when
i
see
it
in
your
hands
i
know
it
is
too
precious
to
be
squandered
among
shadows
li
i
know
that
at
the
dim
end
of
some
day
the
sun
will
bid
me
its
farewell
shepherds
will
play
their
pipes
beneath
the
banyan
trees
and
cattle
graze
on
the
slope
by
the
river
while
my
days
will
pass
into
the
dark
this
is
my
prayer
that
i
may
know
before
i
leave
why
the
earth
called
me
to
her
arms
why
her
night
silence
spoke
to
me
of
stars
and
her
daylight
kissed
my
thoughts
into
flower
before
i
go
may
i
linger
over
my
last
refrain
completing
its
music
may
the
lamp
be
lit
to
see
your
face
and
the
wreath
woven
to
crown
you
lii
what
music
is
that
in
whose
measure
the
world
is
rocked
we
laugh
when
it
beats
upon
the
crest
of
life
we
shrink
in
terror
when
it
returns
into
the
dark
but
the
play
is
the
same
that
comes
and
goes
with
the
rhythm
of
the
endless
music
you
hide
your
treasure
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
we
cry
that
we
are
robbed
but
open
and
shut
your
palm
as
you
will
the
gain
and
the
loss
are
the
same
at
the
game
you
play
with
your
own
self
you
lose
and
win
at
once

have
kissed
this
world
with
my
eyes

it
within
my

folds

have
flooded
its
days

with
thoughts

the

and
my

have
grown
one
and
i
love
my

i
love
the

the

enwoven
with

if
to
leave
this

be
as
real
as
to

it

there
must
be
a
meaning
in
the
meeting
and
the
parting
of
life
if
that
love
were
deceived
in
death

the
canker

this
deceit

tulsidas

wandering
deep
in
thought
by

ganges
in
that
lonely
spot
where
they
burn
their
dead

found
a
woman
sitting
at
the
feet
of
the
corpse
of
her
dead
husband
gaily
dressed
as
for
a
wedding

rose
as
she
saw
him
bowed
to
him

came
for

in

who
is
ever
returning
to

outflowing

from

his
smile
from
my
friend
lips
and
spreads
it
over
my
life
lxvii
you
always
stand
alone
beyond
the
stream
of
my
songs
the
waves
of
my
tunes
wash
your
feet
but
i
know
not
how
to
reach
them
this
play
of
mine
with
you
is
a
play
from
afar
it
is
the
pain
of
separation
that
melts
into
melody
through
my
flute
i
wait
for
the
time
when
your
boat
crosses
over
to
my
shore
and
you
take
my
flute
into
your
own
hands
lxviii
suddenly
the
window
of
my
heart
flew
open
this
morning
the
window
that
looks
out
on
your
heart
i
wondered
to
see
that
the
name
by
which
you
know
me
is
written
in
april
leaves
and
flowers
and
i
sat
silent
the
curtain
was
blown
away
for
a
moment
between
my
songs
and
yours
i
found
that
your
morning
light
was
full
of
my
own
mute
songs
unsung
i
thought
that
i
would
learn
them
at
your
feet
and
i
sat
silent
lxix
you
were
in
the
centre
of
my
heart
therefore
when
my
heart
wandered
she
never
found
you
you
hid
yourself
from
my
loves
and
hopes
till
the
last
for
you
were
always
in
them
you
were
the
inmost
joy
in
the
play
of
my
youth
and
when
i
was
too
busy
with
the
play
the
joy
was
passed
by
you
sang
to
me
in
the
ecstasies
of
my
life
and
i
forgot
to
sing
to
you
lxx
when
you
hold
your
lamp
in
the
sky
it
throws
its
light
on
my
face
and
its
shadow
falls
over
you
when
i
hold
the
lamp
of
love
in
my
heart
its
light
falls
on
you
and
i
am
left
standing
behind
in
the
shadow
lxxi
o
the
waves
the
waves
glistening
with
light
dancing
with
life
the
waves
of
eddying
joy
rushing
for
ever
the
stars
rock
upon
them
thoughts
of
every
tint
are
cast
up
out
of
the
deep
and
scattered
on
the
beach
of
life
birth
and
death
rise
and
fall
with
their
rhythm
and
the
of
my
heart
spreads
its
wings
crying
in
delight
lxxii
the
joy
ran
from
all
the
world
to
build
my
body
the
lights
of
the
skies
kissed
and
kissed
her
till
she
woke
flowers
of
hurrying
summers
sighed
in
her
breath
and
voices
of
winds
and
water
sang
in
her
movements
the
passion
of
the
tide
of
colours
in
clouds
and
in
forests
flowed
into
her
life
and
the
music
of
all
things
caressed
her
limbs
into
shape
she
is
my
bride
she
has
lighted
her
lamp
in
my
house
lxxiii
the
spring
with
its
leaves
and
flowers
has
come
into
my
body
the
bees
hum
there
the
morning
long
and
the
winds
idly
play
with
the
shadows
a
sweet
fountain
springs
up
from
the
heart
of
my
heart
my
eyes
are
washed
with
delight
like
the
morning
and
life
is
quivering
in
all
my
limbs
like
the
sounding
strings
of
the
lute
are
you
wandering
alone
by
the
shore
of
my
life
where
the
tide
is
in
flood
o
lover
of
my
endless
days
are
my
dreams
flitting
round
you
like
the
moths
with
their
wings
and
are
those
your
songs
that
are
echoing
in
the
dark
eaves
of
my
being
who
but
you
can
hear
the
hum
of
the
crowded
hours
that
sounds
in
my
veins
the
glad
steps
that
dance
in
my
breast
the
clamour
of
the
restless
life
beating
its
wings
in
my
body
lxxiv
my
bonds
are
cut
my
debts
are
paid
my
door
has
been
opened
i
go
everywhere
they
crouch
in
their
corner
and
weave
their
web
of
pale
hours
they
count
their
coins
sitting
in
the
dust
and
call
me
back
but
my
sword
is
forged
my
armour
is
put
on
my
horse
is
eager
to
run
i
shall
win
my
kingdom
lxxv
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
i
came
to
your
earth
naked
and
nameless
with
a
wailing
cry
my
voice
is
glad
while
you
my
lord
stand
aside
to
make
room
that
i
may
fill
my
life
even
when
i
bring
you
my
songs
for
an
offering
i
have
the
secret
hope
that
men
will
come
and
love
me
for
them
you
love
to
discover
that
i
love
this
world
where
you
have
brought
me
lxxvi
timidly
i
cowered
in
the
shadow
of
safety
but
now
when
the
surge
of
joy
carries
my
heart
upon
its
crest
my
heart
clings
to
the
cruel
rock
of
its
trouble
i
sat
alone
in
a
corner
of
my
house
thinking
it
too
narrow
for
any
guest
but
now
when
its
door
is
flung
open
by
an
unbidden
joy
i
find
there
is
room
for
thee
and
for
all
the
world
i
walked
upon
tiptoe
careful
of
my
person
perfumed
and
adorned
but
now
when
a
glad
whirlwind
has
overthrown
me
in
the
dust
i
laugh
and
roll
on
the
earth
at
thy
feet
like
a
child
lxxvii
the
world
is
yours
at
once
and
for
ever
and
because
you
have
no
want
my
king
you
have
no
pleasure
in
your
wealth
it
is
as
though
it
were
naught
therefore
through
slow
time
you
give
me
what
is
yours
and
ceaselessly
win
your
kingdom
in
me
day
after
day
you
buy
your
sunrise
from
my
heart
and
you
find
your
love
carven
into
the
image
of
my
life
lxxviii
to
the
birds
you
gave
songs
the
birds
gave
you
songs
in
return
you
gave
me
only
voice
yet
asked
for
more
and
i
sing
you
made
your
winds
light
and
they
are
fleet
in
their
service
you
burdened
my
hands
that
i
myself
may
lighten
them
and
at
last
gain
unburdened
freedom
for
your
service
you
created
your
earth
filling
its
shadows
with
fragments
of
light
there
you
paused
you
left
me
in
the
dust
to
create
your
heaven
to
all
things
else
you
give
from
me
you
ask
the
harvest
of
my
life
ripens
in
the
sun
and
the
shower
till
i
reap
more
than
you
sowed
gladdening
your
heart
o
master
of
the
golden
granary
lxxix
let
me
not
pray
to
be
sheltered
from
dangers
but
to
be
fearless
in
facing
them
let
me
not
beg
for
the
stilling
of
my
pain
but
for
the
heart
to
conquer
it
let
me
not
look
for
allies
in
life
battlefield
but
to
my
own
strength
let
me
not
crave
in
anxious
fear
to
be
saved
but
hope
for
the
patience
to
win
my
freedom
grant
me
that
i
may
not
be
a
coward
feeling
your
mercy
in
my
success
alone
but
let
me
find
the
grasp
of
your
hand
in
my
failure
lxxx
you
did
not
know
yourself
when
you
dwelt
alone
and
there
was
no
crying
of
an
errand
when
the
wind
ran
from
the
hither
to
the
farther
shore
i
came
and
you
woke
and
the
skies
blossomed
with
lights
you
made
me
open
in
many
flowers
rocked
me
in
the
cradles
of
many
forms
hid
me
in
death
and
found
me
again
in
life
i
came
and
your
heart
heaved
pain
came
to
you
and
joy
you
touched
me
and
tingled
into
love
but
in
my
eyes
there
is
a
film
of
shame
and
in
my
breast
a
flicker
of
fear
my
face
is
veiled
and
i
weep
when
i
can
not
see
you
yet
i
know
the
endless
thirst
in
your
heart
for
sight
of
me
the
thirst
that
cries
at
my
door
in
the
repeated
knockings
of
sunrise
lxxxi
you
in
your
timeless
watch
listen
to
my
approaching
steps
while
your
gladness
gathers
in
the
morning
twilight
and
breaks
in
the
burst
of
light
the
nearer
i
draw
to
you
the
deeper
grows
the
fervour
in
the
dance
of
the
sea
your
world
is
a
branching
spray
of
light
filling
your
hands
but
your
heaven
is
in
my
secret
heart
it
slowly
opens
its
buds
in
shy
love
lxxxii
i
will
utter
your
name
sitting
alone
among
the
shadows
of
my
silent
thoughts
i
will
utter
it
without
words
i
will
utter
it
without
purpose
for
i
am
like
a
child
that
calls
its
mother
an
hundred
times
glad
that
it
can
say
mother
lxxxiii
i
i
feel
that
all
the
stars
shine
in
me
the
world
breaks
into
my
life
like
a
flood
the
flowers
blossom
in
my
body
all
the
youthfulness
of
land
and
water
smokes
like
an
incense
in
my
heart
and
the
breath
of
all
things
plays
on
my
thoughts
as
on
a
flute
ii
when
the
world
sleeps
i
come
to
your
door
the
stars
are
silent
and
i
am
afraid
to
sing
i
wait
and
watch
till
your
shadow
passes
by
the
balcony
of
night
and
i
return
with
a
full
heart
then
in
the
morning
i
sing
by
the
roadside
the
flowers
in
the
hedge
give
me
answer
and
the
morning
air
listens
the
travellers
suddenly
stop
and
look
in
my
face
thinking
i
have
called
them
by
their
names
iii
keep
me
at
your
door
ever
attending
to
your
wishes
and
let
me
go
about
in
your
kingdom
accepting
your
call
let
me
not
sink
and
disappear
in
the
depth
of
languor
let
not
my
life
be
worn
out
to
tatters
by
penury
of
waste
let
not
those
doubts
encompass
me
the
dust
of
distractions
let
me
not
pursue
many
paths
to
gather
many
things
let
me
not
bend
my
heart
to
the
yoke
of
the
many
let
me
hold
my
head
high
in
the
courage
and
pride
of
being
your
servant
lxxxiv
the
oarsmen
do
you
hear
the
tumult
of
death
afar
the
call
midst
the
and
poisonous
clouds
the
captain
call
to
the
steersman
to
turn
the
ship
to
an
unnamed
shore
for
that
time
is
over
the
stagnant
time
in
the
port
where
the
same
old
merchandise
is
bought
and
sold
in
an
endless
round
where
dead
things
drift
in
the
exhaustion
and
emptiness
of
truth
they
wake
up
in
sudden
fear
and
ask
comrades
what
hour
has
struck
when
shall
the
dawn
begin
the
clouds
have
blotted
away
the
stars
who
is
there
then
can
see
the
beckoning
finger
of
the
day
they
run
out
with
oars
in
hand
the
beds
are
emptied
the
mother
prays
the
wife
watches
by
the
door
there
is
a
wail
of
parting
that
rises
to
the
sky
and
there
is
the
captain
voice
in
the
dark
come
sailors
for
the
time
in
the
harbour
is
over
all
the
black
evils
in
the
world
have
overflowed
their
banks
yet
oarsmen
take
your
places
with
the
blessing
of
sorrow
in
your
souls
whom
do
you
blame
brothers
bow
your
heads
down
the
sin
has
been
yours
and
ours
the
heat
growing
in
the
heart
of
god
for
ages
the
cowardice
of
the
weak
the
arrogance
of
the
strong
the
greed
of
fat
prosperity
the
rancour
of
the
wronged
pride
of
race
and
insult
to
man
has
burst
god
peace
raging
in
storm
like
a
ripe
pod
let
the
tempest
break
its
heart
into
pieces
scattering
thunders
stop
your
bluster
of
dispraise
and
of
and
with
the
calm
of
silent
prayer
on
your
foreheads
sail
to
that
unnamed
shore
we
have
known
sins
and
evils
every
day
and
death
we
have
known
they
pass
over
our
world
like
clouds
mocking
us
with
their
transient
lightning
laughter
suddenly
they
have
stopped
become
a
prodigy
and
men
must
stand
before
them
saying
we
do
not
fear
you
o
monster
for
we
have
lived
every
day
by
conquering
you
and
we
die
with
the
faith
that
peace
is
true
and
good
is
true
and
true
is
the
eternal
one
if
the
deathless
dwell
not
in
the
heart
of
death
if
glad
wisdom
bloom
not
bursting
the
sheath
of
sorrow
if
sin
do
not
die
of
its
own
revealment
if
pride
break
not
under
its
load
of
decorations
then
whence
comes
the
hope
that
drives
these
men
from
their
homes
like
stars
rushing
to
their
death
in
the
morning
light
shall
the
value
of
the
martyrs
blood
and
mothers
tears
be
utterly
lost
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
not
buying
heaven
with
their
price
and
when
man
bursts
his
mortal
bounds
is
not
the
boundless
revealed
that
moment
lxxxv
the
song
of
the
defeated
my
master
has
bid
me
while
i
stand
at
the
roadside
to
sing
the
song
of
defeat
for
that
is
the
bride
whom
he
woos
in
secret
she
has
put
on
the
dark
veil
hiding
her
face
from
the
crowd
but
the
jewel
glows
on
her
breast
in
the
dark
she
is
forsaken
of
the
day
and
god
night
is
waiting
for
her
with
its
lamps
lighted
and
flowers
wet
with
dew
she
is
silent
with
her
eyes
downcast
she
has
left
her
home
behind
her
from
her
home
has
come
that
wailing
in
the
wind
but
the
stars
are
singing
the
of
the
eternal
to
a
face
sweet
with
shame
and
suffering
the
door
has
been
opened
in
the
lonely
chamber
the
call
has
sounded
and
the
heart
of
the
darkness
throbs
with
awe
because
of
the
coming
tryst
lxxxvi
thanksgiving
those
who
walk
on
the
path
of
pride
crushing
the
lowly
life
under
their
tread
covering
the
tender
green
of
the
earth
with
their
footprints
in
blood
let
them
rejoice
and
thank
thee
lord
for
the
day
is
theirs
but
i
am
thankful
that
my
lot
lies
with
the
humble
who
suffer
and
bear
the
burden
of
power
and
hide
their
faces
and
stifle
their
sobs
in
the
dark
for
every
throb
of
their
pain
has
pulsed
in
the
secret
depth
of
thy
night
and
every
insult
has
been
gathered
into
thy
great
silence
and
the
morrow
is
theirs
o
sun
rise
upon
the
bleeding
hearts
blossoming
in
flowers
of
the
morning
and
the
torchlight
revelry
of
pride
shrunken
to
ashes
the
end
