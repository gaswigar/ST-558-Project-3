chapter
one
the
stranger
in
manchester
dead
and
he
carried
his
secret
with
him
to
his
grave
never
but
he
has
look
his
jaw
has
dropped
ca
you
see
the
change
man
then
he
carried
out
his
threat
after
all
by
heaven
he
has
we
been
fools
reggie
utter
idiots
i
whispered
so
it
seems
i
confess
that
i
fully
expected
he
tell
us
the
truth
when
he
knew
that
the
end
had
really
come
ah
you
did
know
him
as
i
did
i
remarked
bitterly
he
had
a
will
of
iron
and
a
nerve
of
steel
combined
with
the
constitution
of
a
horse
or
he
been
dead
long
ago
but
we
been
outwitted
cleanly
outwitted
by
a
dying
man
he
defied
us
laughed
at
our
ignorance
to
the
very
last
blair
was
no
fool
he
knew
what
knowledge
of
the
truth
meant
to
us
a
huge
fortune
so
he
simply
kept
his
secret
and
left
us
in
penniless
chagrin
well
although
we
lost
thousands
gilbert
i
ca
help
admiring
his
dogged
determination
he
went
through
a
lot
recollect
and
he
been
a
good
friend
to
us
very
good
so
i
suppose
we
really
ought
to
abuse
him
however
much
we
regret
that
he
did
let
us
into
his
secret
ah
if
only
those
white
lips
could
speak
one
word
and
we
both
be
rich
men
i
said
in
regret
gazing
upon
the
dead
white
face
with
its
closed
eyes
and
closely
clipped
beard
lying
there
upon
the
pillow
he
intended
to
hold
his
secret
from
the
very
first
remarked
my
tall
friend
reginald
seton
folding
his
arms
as
he
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
it
is
given
to
every
man
to
make
such
a
discovery
as
he
made
it
took
him
years
to
solve
the
problem
whatever
it
was
but
that
he
really
succeeded
in
doing
so
we
ca
for
a
moment
doubt
and
his
profit
was
over
a
million
sterling
i
remarked
more
like
two
at
the
very
lowest
estimate
recollect
how
when
we
first
knew
him
he
was
in
dire
want
of
a
sovereign
and
now
why
only
last
week
he
gave
twenty
thousand
to
the
hospital
fund
and
all
as
the
result
of
solving
the
enigma
which
for
so
long
we
have
tried
to
discover
in
vain
no
gilbert
he
has
played
the
square
game
by
us
we
assisted
him
put
him
on
his
legs
and
all
that
and
instead
of
revealing
to
us
the
key
to
the
secret
which
he
discovered
and
which
placed
him
among
the
wealthiest
men
of
london
he
refused
even
though
he
knew
that
he
must
die
we
lent
him
money
in
the
old
days
financed
him
kept
mab
at
school
when
he
had
no
funds
and
and
he
repaid
us
every
penny
with
interest
i
interposed
come
do
let
discuss
him
here
the
secret
is
lost
for
ever
enough
and
i
drew
the
sheet
over
the
poor
dead
face
the
countenance
of
burton
blair
the
man
who
during
the
past
five
years
had
been
one
of
london
mysteries
a
strange
adventurous
life
a
career
more
remarkable
perhaps
than
half
those
imagined
by
writers
of
romance
had
been
brought
abruptly
to
an
end
while
the
secret
of
the
source
of
his
enormous
wealth
the
secret
which
we
both
had
for
the
past
five
years
longed
to
share
because
we
were
in
a
sense
justly
entitled
to
participate
in
its
advantages
had
gone
with
him
to
that
bourne
whence
none
return
the
apartment
in
which
we
stood
was
a
small
rather
bedroom
in
the
manchester
the
window
looked
out
upon
the
dark
facade
of
the
infirmary
while
to
that
chamber
of
the
dead
there
came
the
roar
and
bustle
of
the
traffic
and
trams
in
piccadilly
his
story
was
assuredly
one
of
the
strangest
that
any
man
has
ever
told
its
mystery
as
will
be
seen
was
absolutely
bewildering
the
light
of
the
cheerless
february
afternoon
was
quickly
fading
and
as
we
turned
softly
to
descend
and
inform
the
hotel
manager
of
the
fatal
termination
of
the
seizure
i
noticed
that
the
dead
man
stood
in
the
corner
and
that
his
keys
were
still
in
it
we
had
better
take
possession
of
these
i
remarked
locking
the
bag
and
transferring
the
small
bunch
to
my
pocket
his
executors
will
want
them
then
we
closed
the
door
behind
us
and
going
to
the
office
imparted
the
unwelcome
intelligence
that
a
death
had
occurred
in
the
hotel
the
manager
was
however
quite
prepared
to
learn
such
news
for
half
an
hour
before
the
doctor
had
declared
that
the
stranger
could
not
live
his
case
had
been
hopeless
from
the
very
first
briefly
the
facts
were
as
follows
burton
blair
had
bidden
his
daughter
mabel
farewell
left
his
house
in
grosvenor
square
on
the
previous
morning
and
had
taken
the
express
from
euston
to
manchester
where
he
had
said
he
had
some
private
business
to
transact
just
before
the
train
arrived
at
crewe
he
suddenly
became
unwell
and
was
discovered
by
one
of
the
attendants
in
a
state
of
collapse
in
one
of
the
compartments
brandy
and
restoratives
being
administered
he
revived
sufficiently
to
travel
on
to
manchester
being
assisted
out
of
the
train
at
london
road
and
two
porters
had
helped
him
into
a
cab
and
accompanied
him
to
the
hotel
where
on
being
put
to
bed
he
again
lapsed
into
unconsciousness
a
doctor
was
called
but
he
could
not
diagnose
the
ailment
except
that
the
patient
heart
was
seriously
affected
and
that
being
so
a
fatal
termination
of
the
seizure
might
ensue
towards
two
next
morning
blair
who
had
neither
given
his
name
nor
told
the
hotel
people
who
he
was
asked
that
both
seton
and
i
should
be
telegraphed
for
and
the
result
was
that
in
anxious
surprise
we
had
both
travelled
up
to
manchester
where
on
arrival
an
hour
before
we
had
discovered
our
friend
to
be
in
an
utterly
hopeless
condition
on
entering
the
room
we
found
the
doctor
a
young
and
rather
pleasant
man
named
glenn
in
attendance
blair
was
conscious
and
listened
to
the
medical
opinion
without
flinching
indeed
he
seemed
rather
to
welcome
death
than
to
dread
it
for
when
he
heard
that
he
was
in
such
a
very
critical
condition
a
faint
smile
crossed
his
pale
drawn
features
and
he
remarked
every
man
must
die
so
it
may
as
well
be
as
then
turning
to
me
he
added
gilbert
you
are
very
good
to
come
just
to
say
and
he
put
out
his
thin
cold
hand
and
grasped
mine
while
his
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
that
strange
intent
look
that
only
comes
into
a
man
gaze
when
he
is
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
it
is
a
friend
duty
burton
i
answered
deeply
in
earnest
but
you
must
still
hope
doctors
are
often
mistaken
why
you
a
splendid
constitution
have
you
hardly
ever
had
a
day
illness
since
i
was
a
kid
was
the
millionaire
reply
in
a
low
weak
voice
but
this
fit
has
bowled
me
completely
over
we
endeavoured
to
ascertain
exactly
how
he
was
seized
but
neither
reggie
not
the
doctor
could
gather
anything
tangible
i
became
faint
all
of
a
sudden
and
i
know
nothing
more
was
all
the
dying
man
would
reply
but
he
added
turning
again
to
me
tell
mab
till
it
all
over
poor
girl
my
only
regret
is
to
leave
her
you
two
fellows
were
so
very
good
to
her
back
in
the
old
days
you
wo
abandon
her
now
will
you
he
implored
speaking
slowly
and
with
very
great
difficulty
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
certainly
not
old
chap
was
my
answer
if
left
alone
she
want
some
one
to
advise
her
and
to
look
after
her
interests
the
scoundrelly
lawyer
chaps
will
do
that
he
snapped
with
a
strange
hardness
in
his
voice
as
though
he
entertained
no
love
for
his
solicitors
no
i
want
you
to
see
that
no
man
marries
her
for
her
money
you
understand
dozens
of
fellows
are
after
her
at
this
moment
i
know
but
i
rather
see
her
dead
than
she
should
marry
one
of
them
she
must
marry
for
love
love
you
hear
promise
me
gilbert
that
that
you
look
after
her
wo
you
still
holding
his
hand
i
promised
that
was
the
last
word
he
uttered
his
pale
lips
twitched
again
but
no
sound
came
from
them
his
glassy
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
with
a
stony
terrible
stare
as
though
he
were
endeavouring
to
tell
me
something
perhaps
he
was
revealing
to
me
the
great
secret
the
secret
of
how
he
had
solved
the
mystery
of
fortune
and
become
worth
over
a
million
sterling
perhaps
he
was
speaking
of
mab
which
we
knew
not
his
tongue
refused
to
articulate
the
silence
of
death
was
upon
him
thus
he
passed
away
and
thus
did
i
find
myself
bound
to
a
promise
which
i
intended
to
fulfil
even
though
he
had
not
revealed
to
us
his
secret
as
we
confidently
expected
we
believed
that
knowing
himself
to
be
dying
he
had
summoned
us
there
to
impart
that
knowledge
which
would
render
us
both
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
but
in
this
we
had
been
most
bitterly
disappointed
for
five
years
i
confess
we
had
waited
expecting
that
he
would
some
day
share
some
of
his
wealth
with
us
in
return
for
those
services
we
had
rendered
him
in
the
past
yet
now
it
seemed
he
had
coolly
disregarded
his
indebtedness
to
us
and
at
the
same
time
imposed
upon
me
a
duty
by
no
means
easy
the
guardianship
of
his
only
daughter
mabel
chapter
two
contains
certain
mysterious
facts
i
ought
here
to
declare
that
having
regard
to
all
the
curious
and
mysterious
circumstances
of
the
past
the
situation
was
to
me
far
from
satisfactory
as
we
strolled
together
along
market
street
that
cold
night
discussing
the
affair
rather
than
remain
in
the
public
room
of
the
hotel
reggie
suggested
that
the
secret
might
be
written
somewhere
and
sealed
up
among
the
dead
man
effects
but
in
that
case
unless
it
were
addressed
to
us
it
would
be
opened
by
the
persons
the
dying
man
had
designated
as
those
scoundrelly
lawyer
chaps
and
in
all
probability
be
turned
by
them
to
profitable
account
his
solicitors
were
we
knew
leighton
brown
and
leighton
an
eminently
respectable
firm
in
bedford
row
therefore
we
sent
a
telegram
from
the
central
office
informing
them
of
their
client
sudden
death
and
requesting
that
one
of
the
firm
should
at
once
come
to
manchester
to
attend
the
inquest
which
doctor
glenn
had
declared
would
be
necessary
as
the
deceased
man
had
expressed
a
wish
that
mabel
should
for
the
present
remain
in
ignorance
we
did
not
inform
her
of
the
tragic
occurrence
curiosity
prompted
us
to
ascend
again
to
the
dead
man
chamber
and
examine
the
contents
of
his
and
but
beyond
his
clothes
a
and
about
ten
pounds
in
gold
we
found
nothing
i
think
that
we
both
half
expected
to
discover
the
key
to
that
remarkable
secret
which
he
had
somehow
obtained
yet
it
was
hardly
to
be
imagined
that
he
would
carry
such
a
valuable
asset
about
with
him
in
his
luggage
in
the
pocket
of
a
small
which
formed
part
of
the
fittings
of
the
i
discovered
several
letters
all
of
which
i
examined
and
found
them
to
be
of
no
importance
save
one
a
dirty
note
in
uneducated
italian
which
contained
some
passages
which
struck
me
as
curious
indeed
so
strange
was
the
tenor
of
the
whole
communication
that
with
reggie
connivance
i
resolved
to
take
possession
of
it
and
make
further
inquiry
there
were
many
things
about
burton
blair
that
had
puzzled
us
for
years
therefore
we
were
both
determined
if
possible
to
elucidate
the
curious
mystery
that
had
surrounded
him
even
if
he
had
carried
to
his
grave
the
secret
of
his
enormous
fortune
we
alone
in
all
the
world
knew
the
existence
of
the
secret
only
we
were
in
ignorance
of
the
necessary
key
by
which
the
source
of
riches
could
be
opened
the
manner
in
which
he
had
gained
his
great
wealth
was
a
mystery
to
every
one
even
to
his
daughter
mabel
in
the
city
and
in
society
he
was
vaguely
believed
by
some
to
possess
large
interests
in
mines
and
to
be
a
successful
speculator
in
stocks
while
others
declared
that
he
was
the
of
at
least
two
large
cities
in
america
and
yet
others
were
positive
that
certain
concessions
from
the
ottoman
government
had
brought
him
his
gold
all
were
however
mistaken
in
their
surmises
burton
blair
possessed
not
an
acre
of
land
he
had
not
a
shilling
in
any
public
company
he
was
not
interested
in
either
government
concessions
or
industrial
enterprises
no
the
source
of
the
great
wealth
by
which
he
had
in
five
years
been
able
to
purchase
decorate
and
furnish
in
princely
manner
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
grosvenor
square
keep
three
of
the
most
expensive
panhards
motoring
being
his
hobby
and
rent
that
fine
old
jacobean
mansion
mayvill
court
in
herefordshire
came
from
a
source
which
nobody
knew
or
even
suspected
his
were
mysterious
millions
i
wonder
if
anything
will
come
out
at
the
inquest
queried
reggie
later
that
evening
his
lawyers
undoubtedly
know
nothing
he
may
have
left
some
paper
which
reveals
the
truth
i
answered
men
who
are
silent
in
life
often
commit
their
secrets
to
paper
i
do
think
burton
ever
did
he
may
have
done
so
for
mabel
benefit
remember
ah
by
jove
gasped
my
friend
i
never
thought
of
that
if
he
wished
to
provide
for
her
he
would
leave
his
secret
with
some
one
whom
he
could
implicitly
trust
yet
he
trusted
us
up
to
a
certain
point
we
are
the
only
ones
who
have
any
real
knowledge
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
my
tall
friend
who
stood
six
feet
in
his
stockings
the
picture
of
the
easygoing
muscular
englishman
although
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
feminine
frippery
stopped
with
a
low
grunt
of
dissatisfaction
and
carefully
lit
a
fresh
cigar
we
passed
a
dismal
evening
strolling
about
the
main
streets
of
manchester
feeling
that
in
burton
blair
we
had
lost
a
friend
but
when
on
the
following
morning
we
met
herbert
leighton
the
solicitor
in
the
hall
of
the
and
had
a
long
consultation
with
him
the
mystery
surrounding
the
dead
man
became
considerably
heightened
you
both
knew
my
late
client
very
well
indeed
the
solicitor
remarked
after
some
preliminaries
now
are
you
aware
of
the
existence
of
any
one
who
would
profit
by
his
sudden
decease
that
a
curious
question
i
remarked
why
well
the
fact
is
this
explained
the
dark
man
with
some
hesitation
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
foul
play
i
gasped
you
surely
do
think
that
he
was
murdered
why
my
dear
fellow
that
could
be
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
train
and
died
in
bed
in
our
presence
the
solicitor
whose
face
had
now
become
graver
merely
shrugged
his
narrow
shoulders
and
said
we
must
of
course
await
the
result
of
the
inquest
but
from
information
in
my
possession
i
feel
confident
that
burton
blair
did
not
die
a
natural
death
that
same
evening
the
coroner
held
his
inquiry
in
a
private
room
in
the
hotel
and
according
to
the
two
doctors
who
had
made
the
postmortem
earlier
in
the
day
death
was
due
entirely
to
natural
causes
it
was
discovered
that
blair
had
naturally
a
weak
heart
and
that
the
fatal
termination
had
been
accelerated
by
the
oscillation
of
the
train
there
was
absolutely
nothing
whatever
to
induce
any
suspicion
of
foul
play
therefore
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
accordance
with
the
medical
evidence
that
death
was
due
to
natural
causes
and
an
order
was
given
for
the
removal
of
the
body
to
london
for
burial
an
hour
after
the
inquest
i
took
leighton
aside
and
said
as
you
know
i
have
for
some
years
been
one
of
the
late
most
intimate
friends
and
therefore
i
am
naturally
very
much
interested
to
know
what
induced
you
to
suspect
foul
play
my
suspicions
were
well
based
was
his
rather
enigmatical
answer
upon
what
upon
the
fact
that
my
client
himself
had
been
threatened
and
that
although
he
told
no
one
and
laughed
at
my
suggested
precautions
he
has
lived
in
daily
dread
of
assassination
curious
i
ejaculated
very
curious
i
told
him
nothing
of
that
remarkable
letter
i
had
secured
from
the
dead
man
luggage
if
what
he
said
were
really
true
then
there
was
a
very
extraordinary
secret
in
the
death
of
burton
blair
equally
with
that
of
his
strange
romantic
and
mysterious
life
a
secret
that
was
inscrutable
yet
absolutely
unique
it
will
be
necessary
i
think
to
fully
explain
the
curious
circumstances
which
first
brought
us
into
contact
with
burton
blair
and
to
describe
the
mysterious
events
which
followed
our
acquaintanceship
from
beginning
to
end
the
whole
affair
is
so
remarkable
that
many
who
read
this
record
of
facts
may
be
inclined
to
doubt
my
veracity
to
such
i
would
at
the
very
outset
suggest
that
they
make
inquiries
in
london
in
that
little
world
of
adventurers
speculators
and
known
as
the
city
where
i
feel
sure
they
will
have
no
difficulty
in
learning
even
further
interesting
details
regarding
the
man
of
mysterious
millions
whom
this
narrative
partially
concerns
and
certainly
the
true
facts
concerning
him
will
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
be
found
to
form
one
of
the
most
remarkable
romances
in
modern
life
chapter
three
in
which
a
strange
story
is
told
in
order
to
put
the
plain
unvarnished
truth
before
you
i
must
in
the
first
place
explain
that
i
gilbert
greenwood
was
a
man
of
small
means
having
been
left
an
annuity
by
an
ascetic
baptist
but
somewhat
prosperous
aunt
while
reginald
seton
i
had
known
ever
since
we
had
been
lads
together
at
charterhouse
the
son
of
george
seton
a
lace
warehouseman
of
cannon
street
and
alderman
of
the
city
of
london
reggie
had
been
left
at
with
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
and
an
but
rapidly
declining
business
still
brought
up
to
the
lace
trade
in
a
factory
at
nottingham
reggie
boldly
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
and
by
dint
of
close
attention
to
business
succeeding
in
rubbing
along
sufficiently
well
to
avoid
the
bankruptcy
court
and
to
secure
an
income
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year
both
of
us
were
still
bachelors
and
we
chummed
in
comfortable
chambers
in
a
block
of
flats
in
great
russell
street
while
being
also
fond
of
the
only
sport
we
could
afford
we
also
rented
a
cheap
house
in
a
rural
village
called
helpstone
eighty
miles
from
london
in
the
fitzwilliam
country
here
we
spent
each
winter
usually
being
out
two
days
a
week
neither
of
us
being
well
off
we
had
as
may
be
imagined
to
practise
a
good
deal
of
economy
for
is
an
expensive
sport
to
the
poor
man
nevertheless
we
were
both
fortunate
in
possessing
a
couple
of
good
horses
apiece
and
by
dint
of
a
little
squeezing
here
and
there
were
able
to
indulge
in
those
exhilarating
runs
across
country
which
cause
the
blood
to
tingle
with
excitement
and
rejuvenate
all
who
take
part
in
them
reggie
was
sometimes
kept
in
town
by
the
exigencies
of
his
deal
in
torchon
maltese
and
honiton
therefore
i
frequently
lived
alone
in
the
house
with
glave
my
man
to
look
after
me
one
bitterly
cold
evening
in
january
reggie
was
absent
in
london
and
i
having
been
hunting
all
day
was
riding
home
utterly
fagged
out
the
meet
that
morning
had
been
at
kate
cabin
over
in
huntingdonshire
and
after
two
good
runs
i
had
found
myself
beyond
stilton
eighteen
miles
from
home
still
the
scent
had
been
excellent
and
we
had
had
good
sport
therefore
i
took
a
pull
at
my
flask
and
rode
forward
across
country
in
the
gathering
gloom
fortunately
i
found
the
river
fordable
at
water
newton
mill
a
fact
which
saved
me
the
long
detour
by
wansford
and
then
when
within
a
mile
of
home
i
allowed
my
horse
to
walk
as
i
always
did
in
order
that
he
might
cool
down
before
going
to
his
stable
the
dusk
of
the
short
afternoon
was
just
deepening
into
night
and
the
biting
wind
cut
me
like
a
knife
as
i
passed
the
crossroads
about
half
a
mile
from
helpstone
village
jogging
along
steadily
when
of
a
sudden
a
man
burly
figure
loomed
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
high
holly
hedge
and
a
deep
voice
exclaimed
pardon
me
sir
but
i
a
stranger
in
these
parts
and
my
daughter
here
has
fainted
is
there
a
house
near
then
as
i
drew
near
i
saw
huddled
upon
a
heap
of
stones
at
the
roadside
the
slim
fragile
form
of
a
young
girl
of
about
sixteen
wrapped
in
a
thick
cloak
while
in
the
glimmer
of
light
that
remained
i
distinguished
that
the
man
who
was
addressing
me
was
a
bluff
rather
fellow
of
about
or
so
in
a
frayed
suit
of
blue
serge
and
peaked
cap
that
gave
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
seafarer
his
face
was
seamed
and
weatherbeaten
and
his
broad
powerful
jaws
betokened
a
strength
of
character
and
dogged
determination
has
your
daughter
been
taken
ill
i
inquired
when
i
had
thoroughly
examined
him
well
the
fact
is
we
walked
a
long
way
and
i
think
done
up
she
became
dazed
like
about
half
an
hour
ago
and
when
she
sat
down
she
fell
insensible
she
must
stay
here
i
remarked
as
the
fact
became
plain
that
both
father
and
daughter
were
tramps
she
get
frozen
to
death
my
house
is
over
yonder
i
ride
on
and
bring
back
some
one
to
help
carry
her
the
man
commenced
to
thank
me
but
i
touched
my
horse
with
the
spur
and
was
soon
in
the
stableyard
calling
for
glave
to
accompany
me
back
to
the
spot
where
i
had
left
the
wayfarers
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
had
arranged
the
insensible
girl
on
a
couch
in
my
warm
snug
had
forced
some
brandy
down
her
throat
and
she
had
opened
her
eyes
wonderingly
and
looked
round
with
childlike
temerity
upon
her
unfamiliar
surroundings
her
gaze
met
mine
and
i
saw
that
her
countenance
was
undeniably
beautiful
of
that
dark
type
her
eyes
rendered
the
more
luminous
by
the
pallor
of
her
countenance
the
features
were
refined
and
handsome
in
every
line
and
as
she
addressed
her
father
inquiring
what
had
occurred
i
detected
that
she
was
no
mere
waif
of
the
highway
but
on
the
contrary
highly
intelligent
well
mannered
and
well
educated
her
father
in
a
few
deep
words
explained
our
abrupt
meeting
and
my
hospitality
whereupon
she
smiled
upon
me
sweetly
and
uttered
words
of
thanks
it
must
have
been
the
intense
cold
i
think
she
added
somehow
i
felt
benumbed
all
at
once
and
my
head
swam
so
that
i
could
stand
but
it
is
really
very
kind
indeed
of
you
i
so
sorry
that
disturbed
you
like
this
i
assured
her
that
my
only
wish
was
for
her
complete
recovery
and
as
i
spoke
i
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
her
beauty
was
very
remarkable
although
young
and
her
figure
as
yet
not
fully
developed
her
face
was
nevertheless
one
of
the
most
perfect
i
had
ever
seen
from
the
first
moment
my
eyes
fell
upon
her
i
found
her
indescribably
charming
that
she
was
utterly
exhausted
was
rendered
plain
by
the
painful
uneasy
manner
in
which
she
moved
upon
her
couch
her
rusty
black
skirt
and
thick
boots
were
muddy
and
and
by
the
manner
she
pushed
the
tangled
mass
of
dark
hair
from
her
brow
i
knew
that
her
head
ached
glave
in
no
good
mood
at
the
introduction
of
tramps
entered
announcing
that
my
dinner
was
ready
but
she
firmly
yet
with
sweet
grace
declined
my
invitation
to
eat
saying
that
if
i
would
permit
her
she
would
rather
remain
alone
on
the
couch
before
the
fire
for
half
an
hour
longer
therefore
i
sent
her
some
hot
soup
by
old
axford
our
cook
while
her
father
having
washed
his
hands
accompanied
me
to
the
diningroom
he
seemed
taciturn
and
reserved
at
first
but
presently
when
he
had
judged
my
character
sufficiently
he
explained
that
his
name
was
burton
blair
that
in
his
absence
abroad
he
had
lost
his
wife
ten
years
before
and
that
little
mab
was
his
only
child
as
his
appearance
denoted
he
had
been
at
sea
the
greater
part
of
his
life
and
held
a
master
certificate
but
of
late
he
had
been
living
ashore
i
been
home
these
three
years
now
he
went
on
and
i
had
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
i
can
tell
you
poor
mab
i
would
have
minded
had
it
not
been
for
her
she
a
brick
she
is
just
as
her
poor
dear
mother
was
she
done
three
years
of
and
yet
she
never
once
complained
she
knows
my
character
by
now
she
knows
that
when
once
burton
blair
makes
up
his
mind
to
do
a
thing
by
gad
he
does
it
and
he
set
those
square
jaws
of
his
hard
while
a
look
of
determination
and
dogged
persistency
came
into
his
eyes
the
fiercest
i
had
ever
seen
in
any
man
but
blair
why
did
you
leave
the
sea
to
starve
ashore
i
inquired
my
curiosity
aroused
because
well
because
i
had
a
reason
a
strong
reason
was
his
hesitating
reply
you
see
me
homeless
and
hungry
laughed
burton
blair
bitterly
but
i
may
be
a
millionaire
and
his
face
assumed
a
mysterious
expression
which
sorely
puzzled
me
many
and
many
a
time
since
then
have
i
recollected
those
strange
prophetic
words
of
his
as
he
sat
at
my
table
shabby
unkempt
and
ravenously
hungry
a
tramp
from
the
highroad
who
absurd
as
it
then
seemed
held
the
strong
belief
that
ere
long
he
would
be
the
possessor
of
millions
i
remember
well
how
i
smiled
at
his
vague
assertion
every
man
who
falls
low
in
the
social
scale
clings
to
the
belief
that
his
luck
will
change
and
that
by
some
vagary
of
fortune
he
will
come
up
again
smiling
hope
is
never
dead
within
the
ruined
man
by
dint
of
some
careful
questions
i
tried
to
obtain
further
information
regarding
this
confident
hope
of
wealth
which
he
entertained
but
he
would
tell
me
nothing
absolutely
nothing
he
accepted
a
cigar
after
he
had
dined
well
took
brandy
with
his
coffee
and
smoked
with
the
air
of
a
contented
man
who
had
no
single
thought
or
care
in
the
world
a
man
who
knew
exactly
what
the
future
held
for
him
thus
from
the
very
first
burton
blair
was
a
mystery
on
rejoining
mabel
we
found
her
sleeping
peacefully
utterly
fagged
out
therefore
i
induced
him
to
remain
beneath
my
roof
that
night
in
order
that
she
might
rest
and
returning
to
the
her
father
and
i
sat
together
smoking
and
talking
for
several
hours
he
told
me
of
his
hard
rough
years
at
sea
of
strange
adventures
in
savage
lands
of
a
narrow
escape
from
death
at
the
hands
of
a
band
of
natives
in
the
cameroons
and
of
how
for
three
years
he
acted
as
captain
of
a
up
the
congo
one
of
the
pioneers
of
civilisation
he
related
his
thrilling
adventures
calmly
and
naturally
without
any
bragging
but
just
in
that
plain
manner
which
revealed
to
me
that
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
love
an
adventurous
life
because
of
its
perils
and
its
vicissitudes
and
now
i
tramping
the
turnpikes
of
england
he
added
laughing
you
must
no
doubt
think
it
very
strange
greenwood
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
actively
prosecuting
a
rather
curious
quest
the
successful
issue
of
which
will
one
day
bring
me
wealth
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
see
he
added
with
a
strange
wild
look
in
his
great
dark
eyes
as
swiftly
undoing
his
blue
guernsey
and
delving
beneath
it
he
drew
forth
a
square
flat
piece
of
soiled
and
chamois
leather
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
sewed
some
precious
document
or
other
look
my
secret
lies
here
some
day
i
shall
discover
the
key
to
it
maybe
or
next
day
or
next
year
when
it
is
quite
immaterial
the
result
will
be
the
same
my
years
of
continuous
search
and
travel
will
be
rewarded
and
i
shall
be
rich
and
the
world
will
wonder
and
laughing
contentedly
almost
triumphantly
within
himself
he
carefully
replaced
his
precious
document
in
his
chest
and
rising
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
entirely
confident
of
what
was
written
in
the
book
of
fate
that
midnight
scene
in
all
its
strange
romantic
detail
that
occasion
when
the
tired
wayfarer
and
his
daughter
spent
their
first
night
as
my
guests
rose
before
me
when
on
that
bright
cold
afternoon
following
the
inquest
up
at
manchester
i
alighted
from
a
cab
in
front
of
the
big
white
house
in
grosvenor
square
and
received
word
of
carter
the
solemn
manservant
that
miss
mabel
was
at
home
the
magnificent
mansion
with
its
exquisite
decorations
its
genuine
louis
quatorze
furniture
its
valuable
pictures
and
splendid
examples
of
seventeenth
century
statuary
home
of
one
to
whom
expense
was
surely
of
no
account
was
assuredly
sufficient
testimony
that
the
shabby
wayfarer
who
had
uttered
those
words
in
my
narrow
little
five
years
before
had
made
no
idle
boast
the
secret
sewed
within
that
dirty
bag
of
whatever
it
may
have
been
had
already
realised
over
a
million
and
was
still
realising
enormous
sums
until
death
had
now
so
suddenly
put
an
end
to
its
exploitation
the
mystery
of
it
all
was
beyond
solution
and
the
enigma
was
complete
these
and
other
reflections
swept
through
my
mind
as
i
followed
the
footman
up
the
wide
marble
staircase
and
was
shown
ceremoniously
into
the
great
gold
and
white
the
walls
of
which
were
panelled
with
pale
rose
silk
the
four
large
windows
affording
a
wide
view
across
the
square
those
priceless
paintings
those
beautiful
cabinets
and
unique
all
were
purchased
with
the
proceeds
from
that
mysterious
secret
the
secret
which
had
in
that
short
space
of
five
years
been
the
means
of
transforming
a
homeless
wanderer
into
a
millionaire
gazing
aimlessly
across
the
grey
square
with
its
leafless
trees
i
stood
undecided
how
best
to
break
the
sad
news
when
a
slight
of
silk
swept
behind
me
and
turning
quickly
i
confronted
the
dead
daughter
looking
now
at
far
more
sweet
graceful
and
womanly
than
in
that
first
hour
of
our
strange
meeting
by
the
wayside
long
ago
but
her
black
gown
her
trembling
form
and
her
pale
cheeks
told
me
in
an
instant
that
this
woman
in
my
charge
had
already
learnt
the
painful
truth
she
halted
before
me
a
beautiful
tragic
figure
her
tiny
white
hand
nervously
clutching
the
back
of
one
of
the
gilt
chairs
for
support
i
know
she
exclaimed
in
a
broken
voice
quite
unnatural
to
her
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
i
know
greenwood
why
you
have
called
the
truth
has
been
told
to
me
by
leighton
an
hour
ago
ah
my
poor
dear
father
she
sighed
the
words
catching
in
her
throat
as
she
burst
into
tears
why
did
he
go
to
manchester
his
enemies
have
triumphed
just
as
i
have
all
along
feared
they
would
yet
as
he
was
he
believed
ill
of
no
man
he
refused
always
to
heed
my
warnings
and
laughed
at
all
my
apprehensions
yet
alas
the
ghastly
truth
is
now
only
too
plain
my
poor
father
she
gasped
her
handsome
face
blanched
to
the
lips
he
is
dead
and
his
secret
is
out
chapter
four
which
traverses
dangerous
ground
are
you
really
suspicious
mabel
that
your
father
has
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
i
inquired
quickly
of
the
dead
man
daughter
standing
pale
and
unnerved
before
me
i
am
was
her
direct
unhesitating
answer
you
know
his
story
greenwood
you
know
how
he
carried
with
him
everywhere
something
he
had
sewed
in
a
piece
of
chamois
leather
something
which
was
his
most
precious
possession
leighton
tells
me
that
it
is
missing
that
is
unfortunately
so
i
said
we
all
three
searched
for
it
among
his
clothes
and
in
his
luggage
we
made
inquiry
of
the
attendant
who
found
him
insensible
in
the
railway
carriage
of
the
porters
who
conveyed
him
to
the
hotel
of
every
one
in
fact
but
can
find
no
trace
of
it
whatsoever
because
it
has
been
deliberately
stolen
she
remarked
then
your
theory
is
that
he
has
been
assassinated
in
order
to
conceal
the
theft
she
nodded
in
the
affirmative
her
face
still
hard
and
pale
but
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
foul
play
recollect
i
exclaimed
both
medical
men
two
of
the
best
in
manchester
declared
that
death
was
entirely
due
to
natural
causes
i
care
nothing
for
what
they
say
the
little
sachet
which
my
poor
father
sewed
with
his
own
hands
and
guarded
so
carefully
all
these
years
and
which
for
some
curious
reason
he
would
neither
trust
in
any
bank
nor
in
a
safe
deposit
vault
is
missing
his
enemies
have
gained
possession
of
it
just
as
i
felt
confident
they
would
i
recollect
him
showing
me
that
little
bag
of
on
the
first
night
of
our
acquaintance
i
said
he
then
declared
that
what
was
contained
therein
would
bring
him
wealth
and
it
certainly
has
done
i
added
glancing
round
that
magnificent
apartment
it
brought
him
wealth
but
not
happiness
greenwood
she
responded
quickly
that
packet
the
contents
of
which
i
have
never
seen
he
has
carried
with
him
in
his
pocket
or
suspended
round
his
neck
ever
since
it
first
came
into
his
possession
years
ago
in
all
his
clothes
he
had
a
special
pocket
in
which
to
carry
it
while
at
night
he
wore
it
in
a
specially
made
belt
which
was
locked
around
his
waist
i
think
he
regarded
it
as
a
sort
of
charm
or
talisman
which
besides
bringing
him
his
great
fortune
also
preserved
him
from
all
ills
the
reason
of
this
i
can
not
tell
did
you
never
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
document
which
he
considered
so
precious
i
tried
to
do
so
many
times
but
he
would
never
reveal
it
to
me
was
his
secret
he
would
say
and
no
more
both
reggie
and
i
had
times
without
number
endeavoured
to
learn
what
the
mysterious
packet
really
contained
but
had
been
no
more
successful
than
the
charming
girl
now
standing
before
me
burton
blair
was
a
strange
man
both
in
actions
and
in
words
very
reserved
regarding
his
own
affairs
and
yet
curiously
enough
with
the
advent
of
prosperity
he
had
become
a
prince
of
good
fellows
but
who
were
his
enemies
i
inquired
ah
of
that
i
am
likewise
in
utter
ignorance
was
her
reply
as
you
know
during
the
past
year
or
two
like
all
rich
men
he
has
been
surrounded
by
adventurers
and
parasites
of
all
sorts
whom
ford
his
secretary
has
kept
at
arm
length
it
may
be
that
the
existence
of
the
precious
packet
was
known
and
that
my
poor
father
has
fallen
a
victim
to
some
foul
plot
at
east
that
is
my
firm
idea
if
so
the
police
should
certainly
be
informed
i
said
it
is
true
that
the
sachet
which
he
showed
me
on
the
night
of
our
first
meeting
is
now
missing
for
we
have
all
made
the
most
careful
search
for
it
but
in
vain
yet
what
could
its
possession
possibly
profit
any
one
if
the
key
to
what
was
contained
there
is
wanting
but
was
not
this
key
whatever
it
was
also
in
my
father
hands
queried
mabel
blair
was
it
not
the
discovery
of
that
very
key
which
gave
us
all
these
possessions
she
asked
with
the
sweet
womanliness
that
was
her
most
engaging
characteristic
exactly
but
surely
your
father
shrewd
and
cautious
as
he
always
was
would
never
carry
upon
his
person
both
problem
and
key
together
i
ca
really
believe
that
he
do
such
a
foolish
thing
as
that
nor
do
i
although
i
was
his
only
child
and
his
confidante
in
everything
relating
to
his
life
there
was
one
thing
he
persistently
kept
from
me
and
that
was
the
nature
of
his
secret
sometimes
i
have
found
myself
suspecting
that
it
was
not
an
altogether
creditable
one
indeed
one
that
a
father
dare
not
reveal
to
his
daughter
and
yet
no
one
has
ever
accused
him
of
dishonesty
or
of
at
other
times
i
have
noticed
in
his
face
and
manner
an
air
of
distinct
mystery
which
has
caused
me
to
believe
that
the
source
of
our
unlimited
wealth
was
some
curious
and
romantic
one
which
to
the
world
would
be
regarded
as
entirely
incredible
one
night
indeed
as
we
sat
here
at
table
after
dinner
and
while
smoking
he
had
been
telling
me
about
my
poor
mother
who
died
in
lodgings
in
a
back
street
in
manchester
while
he
was
absent
on
a
voyage
to
the
west
coast
of
africa
he
declared
that
if
london
knew
the
source
of
his
income
it
would
be
astounded
he
added
is
a
secret
a
secret
i
intend
to
carry
with
me
to
the
grave
strangely
enough
he
had
uttered
those
very
same
words
to
me
a
couple
of
years
before
when
one
night
he
had
sat
before
the
fire
in
my
rooms
in
great
russell
street
and
i
had
referred
to
his
marvellous
stroke
of
good
fortune
he
had
died
and
he
had
either
carried
out
his
threat
of
destroying
that
evidence
of
his
secret
in
the
shape
of
the
chamois
leather
bag
or
else
it
had
been
ingeniously
stolen
from
him
the
curious
letter
i
had
secured
from
my
friend
luggage
while
puzzling
me
had
aroused
certain
suspicions
that
hitherto
i
had
not
entertained
of
these
i
of
course
told
mabel
nothing
for
i
did
not
wish
to
cause
her
any
greater
pain
in
the
years
we
had
been
acquainted
we
had
always
been
good
friends
although
reggie
was
fifteen
years
her
senior
and
i
thirteen
years
older
than
she
i
believe
she
regarded
both
of
us
as
big
brothers
our
friendship
had
commenced
when
finding
burton
blair
the
seafaring
tramp
as
he
was
we
clubbed
together
from
our
small
means
and
put
her
to
a
finishing
school
at
bournemouth
to
allow
so
young
and
delicate
a
girl
to
tramp
england
aimlessly
in
search
of
some
vague
and
secret
information
which
seemed
to
be
her
erratic
father
object
was
we
decided
an
utter
impossibility
therefore
following
that
night
of
our
first
meeting
at
helpstone
burton
and
his
daughter
remained
our
guests
for
a
week
and
after
many
consultations
and
some
little
economies
we
were
at
last
successful
in
placing
mabel
at
school
a
service
for
which
we
later
received
her
heartfelt
thanks
she
was
utterly
worn
out
poor
child
poverty
had
already
set
its
indelible
stamp
upon
her
sweet
face
and
her
beauty
was
beginning
to
fade
beneath
that
burden
of
disappointment
and
erratic
wandering
when
we
had
so
fortunately
discovered
her
and
been
able
to
rescue
her
from
the
necessity
of
tramping
footsore
over
those
endless
pitiless
highways
contrary
to
our
expectation
it
was
quite
a
long
time
before
we
could
induce
blair
to
allow
his
daughter
to
return
to
school
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
father
and
daughter
were
entirely
devoted
to
one
another
nevertheless
in
the
end
we
triumphed
and
later
when
the
bluff
bearded
wayfarer
came
to
his
own
he
did
not
forget
to
return
thanks
to
us
in
a
very
substantial
manner
indeed
our
present
improved
circumstances
were
due
to
him
for
not
only
had
he
handed
a
cheque
to
reggie
sufficient
to
pay
the
whole
of
the
liabilities
of
the
cannon
street
lace
business
but
to
me
on
my
birthday
three
years
ago
he
had
sent
enclosed
in
a
cheap
silver
cigarette
case
a
draft
upon
his
bankers
for
a
sum
sufficient
to
provide
me
with
a
very
comfortable
little
annuity
burton
blair
never
forgot
his
friends
neither
did
he
ever
forgive
an
unkind
action
mabel
was
his
idol
his
only
real
confidante
and
yet
it
seemed
more
than
strange
that
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
mysterious
source
of
his
colossal
income
together
we
sat
for
over
an
hour
in
that
great
the
very
splendour
of
which
spoke
mystery
percival
the
pleasant
widow
of
a
naval
surgeon
who
was
mabel
chaperon
and
companion
entered
but
left
us
quickly
much
upset
by
the
tragic
news
presently
when
i
told
mabel
of
my
promise
to
her
father
a
slight
blush
suffused
her
pale
cheeks
it
is
really
awfully
good
of
you
to
trouble
over
my
affairs
greenwood
she
said
glancing
at
me
and
then
dropping
her
eyes
modestly
i
suppose
in
future
i
shall
have
to
consider
you
as
my
guardian
and
she
laughed
lightly
twisting
her
ring
around
her
finger
not
as
your
legal
guardian
i
answered
your
father
lawyers
will
no
doubt
act
in
that
capacity
but
rather
as
your
protector
and
your
friend
ah
she
replied
sadly
i
suppose
i
shall
require
both
now
that
poor
dad
is
dead
i
have
been
your
friend
for
over
five
years
mabel
and
i
hope
you
will
still
allow
me
to
carry
out
my
promise
to
your
father
i
said
standing
before
her
and
speaking
in
deep
earnestness
there
must
however
at
the
outset
be
a
clear
and
distinct
understanding
between
us
therefore
permit
me
for
one
moment
to
speak
to
you
candidly
as
a
man
should
to
a
woman
who
is
his
friend
you
mabel
are
young
and
well
you
are
as
you
know
very
no
really
greenwood
she
cried
interrupting
me
and
blushing
at
my
compliment
it
is
too
bad
of
you
i
sure
hear
me
out
please
i
continued
with
mock
severity
you
are
young
you
are
very
and
you
are
rich
you
therefore
possess
the
three
necessary
attributes
which
render
a
woman
eligible
in
these
modern
days
when
sentiment
is
held
of
such
little
account
well
people
who
will
watch
our
intimate
friendship
will
with
declare
no
doubt
that
i
am
seeking
to
marry
you
for
your
money
i
am
quite
sure
the
world
will
say
this
but
what
i
want
you
to
promise
is
to
at
once
refute
such
a
statement
i
desire
that
you
and
i
shall
be
firm
friends
just
as
we
have
ever
been
without
any
thought
of
affection
i
may
admire
you
i
confess
now
that
i
have
always
admired
you
but
with
a
man
of
my
limited
means
love
for
you
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
understand
that
i
do
not
wish
to
presume
upon
the
past
now
that
your
father
is
dead
and
you
are
alone
understand
too
from
the
very
outset
that
i
now
give
you
the
hand
of
firm
friendship
as
i
would
give
it
to
reggie
my
old
schoolfellow
and
best
friend
and
that
in
future
i
shall
safeguard
your
interests
as
though
they
were
my
own
and
i
held
out
my
hands
to
her
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
for
my
words
had
apparently
caused
her
the
most
profound
surprise
very
well
she
faltered
glancing
for
an
instant
up
to
my
face
it
is
a
bargain
if
you
wish
it
to
be
so
i
wish
mabel
to
carry
out
the
promise
i
made
to
your
father
i
said
as
you
know
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
him
for
much
generosity
and
i
wish
therefore
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
to
stand
in
his
place
and
protect
his
daughter
yourself
but
were
we
not
in
the
first
place
both
indebted
to
you
she
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
seton
and
yourself
i
might
have
wandered
on
until
i
died
by
the
wayside
for
what
was
your
father
searching
i
asked
he
surely
told
you
no
he
never
did
i
am
in
entire
ignorance
of
the
reason
of
his
three
years
of
tramping
up
and
down
england
he
had
a
distinct
object
which
he
accomplished
but
what
it
actually
was
he
would
never
reveal
to
me
it
was
i
suppose
in
connexion
with
that
document
he
always
carried
i
believe
it
was
was
her
response
then
she
added
returning
to
her
previous
observations
why
speak
of
your
indebtedness
to
him
greenwood
when
i
know
full
well
how
you
sold
your
best
horse
in
order
to
pay
my
school
fees
at
bournemouth
and
that
you
could
not
hunt
that
season
in
consequence
you
denied
yourself
the
only
little
pleasure
you
had
in
order
that
i
might
be
well
cared
for
i
forbid
you
to
mention
that
again
i
said
quickly
recollect
we
are
now
friends
and
between
friends
there
can
be
no
question
of
indebtedness
then
you
must
not
talk
of
any
little
service
my
father
rendered
to
you
she
laughed
come
now
i
shall
be
unruly
if
you
do
keep
to
your
part
of
the
bargain
and
so
we
were
compelled
at
that
juncture
to
cry
quits
and
we
recommenced
our
friendship
on
a
firm
and
perfectly
basis
yet
how
strange
it
was
the
beauty
of
mabel
blair
as
she
lounged
there
before
me
in
that
magnificent
home
that
was
now
hers
was
surely
sufficient
to
turn
the
head
of
any
man
who
was
not
a
chancery
judge
or
a
catholic
cardinal
different
indeed
from
the
poor
girl
whom
i
had
first
seen
exhausted
and
fallen
by
the
roadside
in
the
winter
gloom
chapter
five
in
which
the
mystery
becomes
considerably
increased
that
the
precious
document
or
whatever
it
was
sewn
up
in
the
which
the
dead
man
had
so
carefully
guarded
through
all
those
years
was
now
missing
was
in
itself
a
very
suspicious
circumstance
while
mabel
vague
but
distinct
apprehensions
which
she
either
would
not
or
could
not
define
now
aroused
my
suspicions
that
burton
blair
had
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
immediately
after
leaving
her
i
therefore
drove
to
bedford
row
and
held
another
consultation
with
leighton
to
whom
i
explained
my
grave
fears
as
i
have
already
explained
greenwood
responded
the
solicitor
leaning
back
in
his
padded
chair
and
regarding
me
gravely
through
his
glasses
i
believe
that
my
client
did
not
die
a
natural
death
there
was
some
mystery
in
his
life
some
strange
romantic
circumstance
which
unfortunately
he
never
thought
fit
to
confide
to
me
he
held
a
secret
he
told
me
and
by
knowledge
of
that
secret
he
obtained
his
vast
wealth
only
half
an
hour
ago
i
made
a
rough
calculation
of
the
present
value
of
his
estate
and
at
the
lowest
i
believe
it
will
be
found
to
amount
to
over
two
and
a
half
millions
the
whole
of
this
i
may
tell
you
in
confidence
goes
unreservedly
to
his
daughter
with
the
exception
of
several
legacies
which
include
ten
thousand
each
to
seton
and
to
yourself
two
thousand
to
percival
and
some
small
sums
to
the
servants
but
he
added
there
is
a
clause
in
the
will
which
is
very
puzzling
and
which
closely
affects
yourself
as
we
both
suspect
foul
play
i
think
i
may
as
well
at
once
show
it
to
you
without
waiting
for
my
unfortunate
client
burial
and
the
formal
reading
of
his
will
then
he
rose
and
from
a
big
black
deed
box
lettered
burton
blair
esquire
he
took
out
the
dead
man
will
and
opening
it
showed
me
a
passage
which
read
ten
i
give
and
bequeath
to
gilbert
greenwood
of
the
cedars
helpstone
the
small
bag
of
chamois
leather
that
will
be
found
upon
me
at
the
time
of
my
death
in
order
that
he
may
profit
by
what
is
contained
therein
and
as
recompense
for
certain
valuable
services
rendered
to
me
let
him
recollect
always
this
rhyme
the
eighth
was
a
knave
to
his
queens
he
one
short
of
seven
and
nine
or
ten
and
let
him
well
and
truly
preserve
the
secret
from
every
man
just
as
i
have
done
that
was
all
a
strange
clause
surely
burton
blair
had
after
all
actually
bequeathed
his
secret
to
me
the
secret
that
had
brought
him
his
colossal
wealth
yet
it
was
already
lost
probably
stolen
by
his
enemies
that
a
curious
doggerel
the
solicitor
smiled
but
poor
blair
possessed
but
little
literary
culture
i
fear
he
knew
more
about
the
sea
than
poetry
yet
after
all
it
seems
a
tantalising
situation
that
you
should
be
left
the
secret
of
the
source
of
my
client
enormous
fortune
and
that
it
should
be
stolen
from
you
in
this
manner
we
had
i
think
better
consult
the
police
and
explain
our
suspicions
i
said
in
bitter
chagrin
that
the
chamois
sachet
should
have
fallen
into
other
hands
i
entirely
agree
with
you
greenwood
we
will
go
together
to
scotland
yard
and
get
them
to
institute
inquiries
if
blair
was
actually
murdered
then
his
assassination
was
accomplished
in
a
most
secret
and
remarkable
manner
to
say
the
least
but
there
is
one
further
clause
in
the
will
which
is
somewhat
disturbing
and
that
is
with
regard
to
his
daughter
mabel
the
testator
has
appointed
some
person
of
whom
i
have
never
heard
a
man
called
paolo
melandrini
an
italian
apparently
living
in
florence
to
be
her
secretary
and
the
manager
of
her
affairs
what
i
cried
amazed
an
italian
to
be
her
secretary
who
is
he
a
person
with
whom
i
am
not
acquainted
whose
name
indeed
has
never
been
mentioned
to
me
by
my
client
he
merely
dictated
it
to
me
when
i
drafted
the
will
but
the
thing
absurd
i
exclaimed
surely
you
ca
let
an
unknown
foreigner
who
may
be
an
adventurer
for
all
we
know
have
control
of
all
her
money
i
fear
there
no
help
for
it
replied
leighton
gravely
it
is
written
here
and
we
shall
be
compelled
to
give
notice
to
this
man
whoever
he
is
of
his
appointment
at
a
salary
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
will
he
really
have
control
of
her
affairs
absolutely
indeed
the
whole
estate
is
left
to
her
on
condition
that
she
accepts
this
fellow
as
her
secretary
and
confidential
adviser
why
blair
must
have
been
mad
i
exclaimed
has
mabel
any
knowledge
of
this
mysterious
italian
she
has
never
heard
of
him
well
in
that
case
i
think
that
before
he
is
informed
of
poor
death
and
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
him
we
ought
at
least
to
find
out
who
and
what
he
is
we
can
in
any
case
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
him
and
see
that
he
does
trick
mabel
out
of
her
money
the
lawyer
sighed
wiped
his
glasses
slowly
and
said
he
will
have
the
entire
management
of
everything
therefore
it
will
be
difficult
to
know
what
goes
on
or
how
much
he
puts
into
his
own
pocket
but
whatever
could
possess
blair
to
insert
such
a
mad
clause
as
that
did
you
point
out
the
folly
of
it
i
did
and
what
did
he
say
he
reflected
a
few
moments
over
my
words
sighed
and
then
answered
is
imperative
leighton
i
have
no
other
alternative
therefore
from
that
i
took
it
that
he
was
acting
under
compulsion
you
believe
that
this
foreigner
was
in
a
position
to
demand
it
eh
the
solicitor
nodded
he
evidently
was
of
opinion
that
the
reason
of
the
introduction
of
this
unknown
person
into
mabel
household
was
a
secret
one
known
only
to
burton
blair
and
to
the
individual
himself
it
was
curious
i
reflected
that
mabel
herself
had
not
mentioned
it
to
me
yet
perhaps
she
had
hesitated
because
i
had
told
her
of
my
promise
to
her
father
and
she
did
not
wish
to
hurt
my
feelings
the
whole
situation
became
hourly
more
complicated
and
more
mysterious
i
was
however
bent
upon
accomplishing
two
things
first
to
recover
the
millionaire
most
precious
possession
which
he
had
bequeathed
to
me
together
with
such
an
extraordinary
injunction
to
recollect
that
doggerel
couplet
which
still
ran
in
my
head
and
secondly
to
make
private
inquiries
regarding
this
unknown
foreigner
who
had
so
suddenly
become
introduced
into
the
affair
that
same
evening
at
six
having
met
reggie
by
appointment
at
leighton
office
we
all
three
drove
to
scotland
yard
where
we
had
a
long
consultation
with
one
of
the
head
officials
to
whom
we
explained
the
circumstances
and
our
suspicions
of
foul
play
well
he
replied
at
length
of
course
i
will
institute
inquiries
in
manchester
and
elsewhere
but
as
the
medical
evidence
has
proved
so
conclusively
that
the
gentleman
in
question
died
from
natural
causes
i
can
not
hold
out
very
much
hope
that
out
department
or
the
manchester
detective
department
can
assist
you
the
grounds
you
have
for
supposing
that
he
met
with
foul
play
are
very
vague
you
must
admit
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
motive
at
all
was
the
theft
of
this
paper
or
whatever
it
was
which
he
carried
upon
him
yet
men
are
not
usually
killed
in
broad
daylight
in
order
to
commit
a
theft
which
any
expert
pickpocket
might
effect
besides
if
his
enemies
or
rivals
knew
what
it
was
and
how
he
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
it
they
could
easily
have
secured
it
without
assassination
but
he
was
in
possession
of
some
secret
remarked
the
solicitor
of
what
character
i
have
unfortunately
no
idea
nobody
knows
all
that
we
are
aware
is
that
its
possession
raised
him
from
poverty
to
affluence
and
that
one
person
if
not
more
was
eager
to
obtain
possession
of
it
naturally
remarked
the
of
criminal
investigations
but
who
was
this
person
unfortunately
i
do
not
know
my
client
told
me
this
a
year
ago
but
mentioned
no
name
then
you
have
no
suspicion
whatever
of
any
one
none
the
little
bag
of
wash
leather
inside
which
the
document
was
sewn
has
been
stolen
and
this
fact
arouses
our
suspicion
of
foul
play
the
official
shook
his
head
very
dubiously
that
is
not
enough
upon
which
to
base
a
suspicion
of
murder
especially
as
we
have
had
all
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
a
and
a
unanimous
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
no
gentlemen
he
added
i
do
see
any
ground
for
really
grave
suspicion
the
document
may
not
have
been
stolen
after
all
blair
seems
to
have
been
of
a
somewhat
eccentric
disposition
like
many
men
who
suddenly
rise
in
the
world
and
he
may
have
hidden
it
away
for
somewhere
to
me
this
seems
by
far
the
most
likely
theory
especially
as
he
had
expressed
a
fear
that
his
enemies
sought
to
gain
possession
of
it
but
surely
if
there
is
suspicion
of
murder
it
is
the
duty
of
the
police
to
investigate
it
i
exclaimed
resentfully
granted
but
where
is
the
suspicion
neither
doctors
coroner
local
police
nor
jury
entertain
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
died
from
natural
causes
he
argued
in
that
case
the
manchester
police
have
neither
right
nor
necessity
to
interfere
but
there
has
been
a
theft
what
proof
have
you
of
it
he
asked
raising
his
grey
eyebrows
and
tapping
the
table
with
his
pen
if
you
can
show
me
that
a
theft
has
been
committed
then
i
will
put
in
motion
the
various
influences
at
my
command
on
the
contrary
you
merely
suspect
that
this
something
sewn
in
a
bag
has
been
stolen
yet
it
may
be
hidden
in
some
place
difficult
to
find
but
nevertheless
in
safety
as
however
you
all
three
allege
that
the
unfortunate
gentleman
was
assassinated
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
this
mysterious
little
packet
of
which
he
was
so
careful
i
will
communicate
with
the
manchester
city
police
and
ask
them
to
make
what
inquiries
they
can
further
than
that
gentlemen
he
added
suavely
i
fear
that
my
department
can
not
assist
you
then
all
i
have
to
reply
remarked
leighton
bluntly
is
that
the
public
opinion
of
the
futility
of
this
branch
of
the
police
in
the
detection
of
crime
is
fully
justified
and
i
shall
not
fail
to
see
that
public
attention
is
called
to
the
matter
through
the
press
it
simply
a
disgrace
i
only
acting
sir
upon
my
instructions
conjointly
with
what
you
have
yourself
told
me
was
his
answer
i
assure
you
that
if
i
ordered
inquiries
to
be
made
in
every
case
in
which
persons
are
alleged
to
have
been
murdered
i
should
require
a
detective
force
as
large
as
the
british
army
why
not
a
day
passes
without
i
receive
dozens
of
secret
callers
and
anonymous
letters
all
alleging
assassination
generally
against
some
person
towards
whom
they
entertain
a
dislike
eighteen
years
as
head
of
this
department
however
has
i
think
taught
me
how
to
distinguish
a
case
for
inquiry
which
yours
is
not
argument
proved
futile
the
official
mind
was
made
up
that
burton
blair
had
not
fallen
a
victim
to
foul
play
therefore
we
could
hope
for
no
assistance
so
with
our
dissatisfaction
rather
plainly
marked
we
rose
and
went
out
again
into
whitehall
it
a
scandal
reggie
declared
angrily
poor
blair
has
been
murdered
everything
points
to
it
and
yet
the
police
wo
lift
a
finger
to
assist
us
to
reveal
the
truth
just
because
a
doctor
discovered
that
he
had
a
weak
heart
it
placing
a
premium
on
crime
he
added
his
fist
clenched
savagely
i
relate
the
whole
thing
to
my
friend
mills
the
member
for
west
derbyshire
and
get
him
to
ask
a
question
in
the
house
we
see
what
this
new
home
secretary
says
to
it
it
be
a
nasty
pill
for
him
i
wager
oh
he
have
some
typewritten
official
excuse
ready
never
fear
laughed
leighton
if
they
wo
help
us
we
must
make
inquiries
for
ourselves
the
solicitor
parted
from
us
in
trafalgar
square
arranging
to
meet
us
at
grosvenor
square
after
the
funeral
when
the
will
would
be
formally
read
before
the
dead
man
daughter
and
her
companion
percival
and
then
he
added
we
shall
have
to
take
some
active
steps
to
discover
this
mysterious
person
who
is
in
future
to
control
her
fortune
i
undertake
the
inquiries
i
said
fortunately
i
speak
italian
therefore
before
we
give
him
notice
of
blair
death
i
go
out
to
florence
and
ascertain
who
and
what
he
is
truth
to
tell
i
had
a
suspicion
that
the
letter
which
i
had
secured
from
the
dead
blotting
book
and
which
i
had
kept
secretly
to
myself
had
been
written
by
this
unknown
individual
paolo
melandrini
although
it
bore
neither
address
nor
signature
and
was
in
a
heavy
and
rather
uneducated
hand
it
was
evidently
the
letter
of
a
tuscan
for
i
detected
in
it
certain
phonetic
spelling
which
was
purely
florentine
translated
the
strange
communication
read
as
follows
your
letter
reached
me
only
this
morning
the
ceco
blind
man
is
in
paris
on
his
way
to
london
the
girl
is
with
him
and
they
evidently
know
something
so
be
very
careful
he
and
his
ingenious
friends
will
probably
try
and
trick
you
i
am
still
at
my
post
but
the
water
has
risen
three
metres
on
account
of
the
heavy
rains
nevertheless
farming
has
been
good
so
i
shall
expect
to
meet
you
at
vespers
in
san
frediano
on
the
evening
of
the
of
next
month
i
have
something
most
important
to
tell
you
recollect
that
the
ceco
means
mischief
and
act
accordingly
times
without
number
i
carefully
translated
the
curious
missive
word
for
word
it
seemed
full
of
hidden
meaning
what
seemed
most
probable
was
that
the
person
known
as
the
blind
man
who
was
blair
enemy
had
actually
been
successful
in
gaining
possession
of
that
precious
little
sachet
of
chamois
leather
that
was
now
mine
by
right
together
with
the
mysterious
secret
it
contained
chapter
six
concerns
three
capital
a
the
function
in
the
library
at
grosvenor
square
on
the
following
afternoon
was
as
may
be
supposed
a
very
sad
and
painful
one
mabel
blair
dressed
in
deep
mourning
her
eyes
betraying
traces
of
tears
sat
still
and
silent
while
the
solicitor
drily
read
over
the
will
clause
by
clause
she
made
no
comment
even
when
he
repeated
the
dead
man
appointment
of
the
unknown
italian
to
be
manager
of
his
daughter
fortune
but
who
is
he
pray
demanded
percival
in
her
quiet
refined
voice
i
have
never
heard
blair
speak
of
any
such
person
nor
have
i
admitted
leighton
pausing
a
moment
to
readjust
his
glasses
and
then
continuing
to
read
the
document
through
to
the
end
we
were
all
thoroughly
glad
when
the
formality
was
over
afterwards
mabel
whispered
to
me
that
she
wished
to
see
me
alone
in
the
and
when
we
had
entered
together
and
i
had
closed
the
door
she
said
last
night
i
searched
the
small
safe
in
my
father
bedroom
where
he
sometimes
kept
his
private
papers
and
things
there
were
a
quantity
of
my
poor
mother
letters
written
to
him
years
ago
when
he
was
at
sea
but
nothing
else
only
this
and
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
small
soiled
and
frayed
an
ace
of
hearts
upon
which
certain
cabalistic
capitals
had
been
written
in
three
columns
in
order
that
you
shall
properly
understand
the
arrangement
and
position
of
the
letters
it
will
perhaps
be
as
well
if
i
here
reproduce
it
that
curious
i
remarked
turning
it
over
anxiously
in
my
hand
have
you
tried
to
discover
what
meaning
the
words
convey
yes
but
it
some
cipher
or
other
i
think
you
will
notice
that
the
two
upper
columns
commence
with
and
the
lower
column
ends
with
the
same
letter
the
card
is
the
ace
of
hearts
and
in
all
those
points
i
detect
some
hidden
meaning
no
doubt
i
said
but
was
there
an
appearance
of
it
being
carefully
preserved
yes
it
was
sealed
in
a
envelope
to
itself
and
marked
in
my
father
handwriting
blair
private
i
wonder
what
it
means
ah
i
wonder
i
exclaimed
pondering
deeply
and
still
gazing
upon
the
three
columns
of
fourteen
letters
i
tried
to
decipher
it
by
the
usual
known
methods
of
the
easy
cipher
but
could
make
nothing
intelligible
of
it
there
were
some
hidden
words
there
and
being
utterly
unintelligible
they
caused
me
considerable
thought
why
blair
had
preserved
that
card
in
such
secrecy
was
to
say
the
least
a
mystery
in
it
i
suspected
there
was
some
hidden
clue
to
his
secret
but
of
its
nature
i
could
not
even
guess
when
we
had
discussed
it
for
a
long
time
arriving
at
no
satisfactory
conclusion
i
suggested
that
she
should
go
abroad
with
percival
for
a
few
weeks
so
as
to
change
her
surroundings
and
endeavour
to
forget
her
sudden
bereavement
but
she
only
shook
her
head
murmuring
no
i
prefer
to
remain
here
the
loss
of
my
poor
father
would
be
the
same
to
me
abroad
as
it
is
here
but
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
i
urged
with
deep
sympathy
we
are
doing
our
utmost
to
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
your
father
actions
and
the
means
by
which
he
came
by
his
death
indeed
i
am
leaving
for
italy
in
order
to
make
secret
inquiries
regarding
this
person
who
is
appointed
your
secretary
ah
yes
she
sighed
i
wonder
who
he
is
i
wonder
what
motive
my
father
could
possibly
have
in
placing
my
affairs
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
he
is
probably
an
old
friend
of
your
father
i
suggested
no
she
responded
i
knew
all
his
friends
he
had
only
one
secret
from
me
the
secret
of
the
source
of
his
wealth
that
he
always
refused
point
blank
to
tell
me
i
shall
travel
direct
to
florence
and
discover
what
i
can
before
the
lawyers
give
this
mysterious
person
notice
of
your
father
death
i
said
i
may
obtain
some
knowledge
which
will
be
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
us
hereafter
ah
it
is
really
very
good
of
you
greenwood
she
answered
lifting
her
beautiful
eyes
to
mine
with
an
expression
of
profound
gratitude
i
must
admit
that
the
idea
of
being
closely
associated
with
a
stranger
and
that
stranger
a
foreigner
causes
me
considerable
apprehension
but
he
may
be
young
and
good
looking
the
veritable
paolo
of
romance
and
you
his
francesca
i
suggested
smiling
her
sweet
lips
relaxed
slightly
but
she
shook
her
head
sighing
as
she
answered
please
do
anticipate
anything
of
the
kind
i
only
hope
he
may
be
old
and
very
ugly
so
that
he
will
not
arouse
my
jealousy
eh
i
laughed
really
mabel
if
our
friendship
were
not
upon
such
a
basis
i
should
allow
myself
to
act
the
part
of
lover
you
know
i
now
do
be
foolish
she
interrupted
raising
her
small
finger
in
mock
reproval
remember
what
you
said
yesterday
i
said
what
i
meant
and
so
did
i
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
like
to
think
of
you
as
my
big
brother
she
declared
i
suppose
i
shall
never
love
she
added
reflectively
gazing
into
the
blazing
fire
no
no
do
say
that
mabel
you
one
day
meet
some
man
in
your
own
station
love
him
marry
and
be
happy
i
said
my
hand
upon
her
shoulder
recollect
that
with
your
wealth
you
can
secure
the
pick
of
the
matrimonial
market
some
impoverished
young
aristocrat
you
mean
no
thanks
already
met
a
good
many
but
their
disguise
of
affection
has
always
been
much
too
thin
most
of
them
wanted
my
money
to
pay
off
mortgages
on
their
estates
no
i
much
prefer
a
poor
man
although
i
shall
marry
never
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
i
remarked
quite
bluntly
i
always
thought
you
would
marry
young
lord
newborough
you
both
seemed
very
good
friends
so
we
were
until
he
proposed
to
me
and
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
with
that
clear
gaze
and
those
splendid
eyes
wide
open
in
wonderment
almost
like
a
child
her
character
was
a
strangely
complex
one
as
a
tall
willowy
girl
in
those
early
days
of
our
acquaintance
i
knew
her
to
be
and
wilful
yet
of
that
sweet
affectionate
disposition
that
endeared
her
to
every
one
with
whom
she
came
into
contact
her
nature
was
so
calm
and
so
sweet
that
in
her
love
seemed
an
unconscious
impulse
i
had
often
thought
she
was
surely
too
soft
too
good
too
fair
to
be
cast
among
the
briers
of
the
world
and
fall
and
bleed
upon
the
thorns
of
life
the
world
is
just
as
cold
and
pitiless
and
just
as
full
of
pitfalls
for
the
young
and
unwary
in
mayfair
as
in
mile
end
hence
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
that
man
now
silent
in
his
grave
it
was
my
duty
to
protect
her
from
the
thousand
and
one
wiles
of
those
who
would
endeavour
to
profit
by
sex
and
inexperience
her
early
privations
her
hard
life
in
youth
while
her
father
was
absent
at
sea
and
those
weary
months
of
tramping
the
turnpikes
of
england
all
had
had
their
effect
upon
her
with
her
love
seemed
to
be
scarcely
a
passion
or
a
sentiment
but
a
dreamy
enchantment
a
reverie
which
a
fairy
spell
dissolved
or
riveted
at
pleasure
so
exquisitely
delicate
was
her
character
just
as
was
her
countenance
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
touch
would
profane
it
like
a
strain
of
sad
sweet
music
which
comes
floating
by
on
the
wings
of
night
and
silence
and
which
we
rather
feel
than
hear
like
the
exhalation
of
the
violet
dying
even
upon
the
sense
it
charms
like
the
dissolved
in
air
before
it
has
caught
a
stain
of
earth
like
the
light
surf
severed
from
the
billow
which
a
breath
disperses
such
was
her
nature
so
full
of
that
modesty
grace
and
tenderness
without
which
a
woman
is
no
woman
as
she
stood
there
before
me
a
frail
delicate
figure
in
her
plain
black
gown
and
her
hand
in
mine
thanking
me
for
the
investigation
which
i
was
undertaking
in
her
behalf
and
wishing
me
i
shuddered
to
think
of
her
thrown
alone
amid
harsh
and
adverse
destinies
and
amid
all
the
corruptions
and
sharks
of
society
perhaps
without
energy
to
resist
or
will
to
act
or
strength
to
endure
alone
in
such
a
case
the
end
must
inevitably
be
desolation
i
wished
her
farewell
turning
from
her
with
a
feeling
that
loving
her
as
i
admit
i
did
i
was
nevertheless
unworthy
of
her
yet
surely
i
was
playing
a
dangerous
game
i
had
entertained
a
strong
and
increasing
affection
for
her
ever
since
that
winter
night
down
at
helpstone
still
now
that
she
was
possessor
of
vast
wealth
i
felt
that
the
difference
in
our
ages
and
the
fact
that
i
was
a
poor
man
were
both
barriers
to
our
marriage
indeed
she
had
never
exerted
any
of
the
feminine
wiles
of
flirtation
towards
me
she
had
never
once
allowed
me
to
think
that
i
had
captivated
her
she
had
spoken
the
truth
she
regarded
me
as
an
elder
brother
that
was
all
that
same
night
as
i
paced
the
deck
of
the
channel
steamer
in
the
teeth
of
a
wintry
gale
watching
the
revolving
light
of
calais
harbour
growing
more
and
more
distinct
my
thoughts
were
full
of
her
love
is
the
teacher
grief
the
tamer
and
time
the
healer
of
the
human
heart
while
the
engines
throbbed
the
wind
howled
and
the
dark
seas
swirled
past
i
paced
up
and
down
puzzling
over
the
in
my
pocket
and
reflecting
upon
all
that
had
occurred
the
rich
fancies
of
unbowed
youth
the
visions
of
hopes
the
shadows
of
unborn
joys
the
gay
colourings
of
the
dawn
of
existence
what
ever
my
memory
had
treasured
up
came
before
me
in
review
but
lived
no
longer
within
my
heart
i
recollected
that
truism
of
rochefoucauld
il
est
difficile
de
definer
ce
en
peut
dire
est
que
dans
un
passion
de
regner
dans
les
esprits
une
sympathie
et
dans
le
corps
ce
envie
cachee
et
delicate
de
posseder
ce
que
aime
apres
beaucoup
de
mysteres
yes
i
loved
her
with
all
my
heart
with
all
my
soul
but
to
me
i
recognised
that
it
was
not
permitted
my
duty
the
duty
i
had
promised
to
fulfil
to
that
dying
man
whose
had
been
a
secret
romance
was
to
act
as
mabel
protector
and
not
to
become
her
lover
and
thus
profit
by
her
wealth
blair
had
left
his
secret
to
me
in
order
no
doubt
to
place
me
beyond
the
necessity
of
and
as
it
had
been
lost
it
was
my
duty
to
him
and
to
myself
to
spare
no
effort
to
recover
it
with
these
sentiments
firmly
established
within
my
heart
i
entered
the
at
calais
and
started
on
the
first
stage
of
my
journey
across
europe
from
the
channel
to
the
mediterranean
three
days
later
i
was
strolling
up
the
via
tornabuoni
in
florence
that
thoroughfare
of
mediaeval
palaces
banks
consulates
and
shops
that
had
been
so
familiar
to
me
each
winter
until
i
had
taken
to
hunting
in
england
in
preference
to
the
sunshine
of
the
lung
arno
and
the
cascine
indeed
some
of
my
early
years
had
been
spent
in
italy
and
i
had
grown
to
love
it
as
every
englishman
does
in
that
bright
february
morning
as
i
passed
up
the
long
crooked
street
filled
by
the
nonchalant
florentines
and
the
wealthy
foreigners
out
for
an
airing
i
passed
many
men
and
women
of
my
acquaintance
doney
and
giacosa
the
favourite
lounges
of
the
men
were
agog
with
rich
idlers
sipping
cocktails
or
that
seductive
known
in
the
via
tornabuoni
as
a
the
baskets
of
the
gave
a
welcome
touch
of
colour
to
the
grim
grey
of
the
colossal
palace
of
the
strozzi
while
from
the
consulates
the
flags
of
various
nations
most
conspicuous
of
all
being
that
of
the
major
reminded
me
that
it
was
the
of
santa
margherita
in
the
old
days
when
i
used
to
live
with
a
couple
of
italian
artillery
officers
and
a
dutch
in
the
top
floor
of
one
of
those
great
old
palaces
in
the
via
dei
banchi
the
via
tornabuoni
used
to
be
my
morning
walk
for
there
one
meets
everybody
the
ladies
shopping
or
going
to
the
libraries
and
the
men
gossiping
on
the
kerb
a
habit
quickly
acquired
by
every
englishman
who
takes
up
his
abode
in
italy
it
was
astonishing
too
what
a
crowd
of
faces
i
passed
that
morning
english
peers
and
peeresses
members
of
parliament
financial
magnates
city
sharks
manufacturers
and
tourists
of
every
grade
and
of
every
nation
his
highness
the
count
of
turin
returning
from
drill
rode
by
laughing
with
his
and
saluting
those
he
knew
the
women
mostly
wore
their
smartest
toilettes
with
fur
because
a
cold
wind
came
up
from
the
arno
the
scent
of
flowers
was
in
the
air
bright
laughter
and
incessant
chatter
sounded
everywhere
and
the
old
lily
city
was
alive
with
gaiety
perhaps
no
city
in
all
the
world
is
so
full
of
charm
nor
so
full
of
contrasts
as
quaint
old
florence
with
her
wonderful
cathedral
her
antique
bridge
with
rows
of
jewellers
shops
upon
it
her
magnificent
churches
her
ponderous
palaces
and
her
dark
silent
mediaeval
streets
little
changed
some
of
them
since
the
days
when
they
were
trodden
by
giotto
and
by
dante
time
has
laid
his
hand
lightly
indeed
upon
the
city
of
flowers
but
whenever
he
has
done
so
he
has
altered
it
out
of
all
recognition
and
the
garish
modernity
of
certain
streets
and
piazzas
surely
grates
upon
those
who
like
myself
knew
the
old
city
before
the
piazza
vittorio
always
the
piazza
vittorio
synonym
of
vandalism
had
been
constructed
and
the
old
ghetto
picturesque
if
unclean
was
still
in
existence
two
men
both
of
them
italian
stopped
to
salute
me
as
i
walked
and
to
wish
me
one
was
an
advocate
whose
wife
was
accredited
one
of
the
prettiest
women
in
that
city
where
strangely
enough
the
most
striking
type
of
beauty
is
fair
haired
the
other
was
the
cavaliere
alinari
secretary
to
the
british
or
the
major
as
everybody
speaks
of
him
i
had
only
arrived
in
florence
two
hours
before
and
after
a
wash
at
the
had
gone
forth
with
the
object
of
cashing
a
cheque
at
french
prior
to
commencing
my
inquiries
meeting
alinari
however
caused
me
to
halt
for
a
moment
and
after
he
had
expressed
pleasure
at
my
return
i
asked
do
you
by
any
chance
happen
to
know
any
one
by
the
name
of
melandrini
paolo
melandrini
his
address
is
given
me
as
via
san
cristofano
number
eight
he
looked
at
me
rather
strangely
with
his
sharp
eyes
stroked
his
dark
beard
a
moment
and
replied
in
english
with
a
slight
accent
the
address
does
not
sound
very
inviting
greenwood
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
the
gentleman
but
the
via
san
cristofano
is
one
of
the
poorest
and
worst
streets
in
florence
just
behind
santa
croce
from
the
via
ghibellina
i
should
not
advise
you
to
enter
that
quarter
at
night
there
are
some
very
bad
characters
there
well
i
explained
the
fact
is
i
have
come
down
here
expressly
to
ascertain
some
facts
concerning
this
person
then
do
do
it
yourself
was
my
friend
strong
advice
employ
some
one
who
is
a
florentine
if
it
is
a
case
of
confidential
inquiries
he
will
certainly
be
much
more
successful
than
you
can
ever
be
the
moment
you
set
foot
in
that
street
it
would
be
known
in
every
tenement
that
an
inglese
was
asking
questions
and
he
added
with
a
meaning
smile
they
resent
questions
being
asked
in
the
via
san
cristofano
chapter
seven
the
mysterious
foreigner
i
felt
that
his
advice
was
good
and
in
further
conversation
over
a
at
giacosa
he
suggested
that
i
should
employ
a
very
shrewd
but
ugly
little
old
man
named
carlini
who
sometimes
made
confidential
inquiries
on
behalf
of
the
consulate
an
hour
later
the
old
man
called
at
the
a
bent
shuffling
old
fellow
shabbily
dressed
with
a
grey
soft
felt
rather
greasy
hat
stuck
jauntily
on
the
side
of
his
head
a
typical
florentine
of
the
people
they
called
him
babbo
carlini
in
the
markets
i
afterwards
learned
and
cooks
and
were
fond
of
playing
pranks
upon
him
believed
by
every
one
to
be
a
little
childish
he
fostered
the
idea
because
it
gave
him
greater
facilities
in
his
secret
inquiries
for
he
was
regularly
employed
by
the
police
in
serious
cases
and
through
his
shrewdness
many
a
criminal
had
been
brought
to
justice
in
the
privacy
of
my
bedroom
i
explained
in
italian
the
mission
i
wished
him
to
execute
for
me
si
signore
was
all
he
responded
and
this
at
every
pause
i
made
his
boots
were
sadly
cracked
and
down
at
heel
and
he
was
badly
in
want
of
clean
linen
but
from
his
handkerchief
pocket
there
arose
a
small
row
of
toscani
those
long
thin
penny
cigars
so
dear
to
the
italian
palate
recollect
i
impressed
upon
the
old
fellow
you
must
if
possible
find
a
way
of
striking
up
an
acquaintance
with
this
individual
paolo
melandrini
obtain
from
him
all
you
can
about
himself
and
arrange
so
that
i
have
as
soon
as
possible
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
without
being
myself
observed
this
matter
i
added
is
strictly
confidential
and
i
engage
you
for
one
week
in
my
service
at
a
wage
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
lire
here
are
one
hundred
to
pay
your
current
expenses
he
took
the
green
banknotes
in
his
hand
and
with
a
muttered
tanti
grazie
signore
transferred
it
to
the
inner
pocket
of
his
shabby
jacket
you
must
on
no
account
allow
the
man
to
suspect
that
any
inquiry
is
being
made
concerning
him
mind
that
he
knows
nothing
of
any
englishman
in
florence
asking
about
him
or
it
will
arouse
his
suspicions
at
once
be
very
careful
in
all
that
you
say
and
do
and
report
to
me
tonight
at
what
time
shall
i
meet
you
late
the
old
fellow
grunted
he
may
be
a
and
if
so
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
anything
of
him
till
evening
i
call
here
at
eleven
and
then
he
shuffled
out
leaving
an
odour
of
stale
garlic
and
strong
tobacco
i
began
to
wonder
what
the
hotel
people
would
think
of
me
entertaining
such
a
visitor
for
the
is
one
of
the
smartest
in
florence
but
my
apprehensions
were
quickly
dispelled
for
as
we
passed
out
i
heard
the
uniformed
exclaim
in
italian
hulloa
babbo
got
a
fresh
job
to
which
the
old
fellow
only
grinned
in
satisfaction
and
with
another
grunt
passed
out
into
the
sunshine
that
day
passed
long
and
anxiously
i
idled
on
the
ponte
vecchio
and
in
the
dim
religious
gloom
of
the
santissima
anunziata
in
the
afternoon
making
several
calls
upon
friends
i
had
known
and
in
the
evening
dining
at
doney
in
preference
to
the
crowded
of
english
and
americans
at
the
at
eleven
i
awaited
old
carlini
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
and
on
his
arrival
took
him
anxiously
in
the
lift
up
to
my
room
well
he
commenced
speaking
in
his
florentine
tongue
i
have
been
pursuing
inquiries
all
day
but
have
discovered
very
little
the
individual
you
require
appears
to
be
a
mystery
i
expected
so
was
my
reply
what
have
you
discovered
regarding
him
they
know
him
in
via
san
cristofano
he
has
a
small
apartment
on
the
third
floor
of
number
eight
which
he
only
visits
occasionally
the
place
is
looked
after
by
an
old
woman
of
eighty
whom
i
managed
to
question
discovering
that
this
melandrini
was
absent
and
that
a
cloth
was
hanging
from
the
window
to
dry
i
presented
myself
as
an
agent
of
police
to
explain
that
the
hanging
out
of
a
cloth
was
a
contravention
of
the
law
and
liable
to
a
fine
of
two
francs
i
then
obtained
from
her
a
few
facts
concerning
her
she
told
me
all
she
knew
which
did
not
amount
to
much
he
had
a
habit
of
arriving
suddenly
generally
at
evening
and
staying
there
for
one
or
two
days
never
emerging
in
the
daytime
where
he
lived
at
other
times
she
did
not
know
letters
often
came
for
him
bearing
an
english
stamp
and
she
kept
them
indeed
she
showed
me
one
that
arrived
ten
days
ago
and
is
now
awaiting
him
could
it
be
from
blair
i
wondered
what
was
the
character
of
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
i
inquired
an
english
hand
thick
and
heavy
signore
was
spelt
wrongly
i
noticed
blair
hand
was
thick
for
he
generally
wrote
with
a
quill
i
longed
to
examine
it
for
myself
then
this
old
has
no
idea
of
the
individual
address
none
whatever
he
told
her
that
if
any
one
ever
called
for
him
to
say
that
his
movements
are
uncertain
and
that
any
message
must
be
left
in
writing
what
is
the
place
like
poorly
furnished
and
very
dirty
and
neglected
the
old
woman
is
nearly
blind
and
very
feeble
does
she
describe
him
as
a
gentleman
i
could
not
ask
her
for
his
description
but
from
inquiries
in
other
quarters
i
learned
that
he
was
in
all
probability
a
person
who
was
in
trouble
with
the
police
or
something
of
that
sort
a
man
who
kept
a
at
the
end
of
the
street
told
me
in
confidence
that
about
six
months
before
two
men
evidently
agents
of
police
had
been
very
active
in
their
inquiries
concerning
him
they
had
set
a
watch
upon
the
house
for
a
month
but
he
had
not
returned
he
described
him
as
a
man
with
a
beard
who
was
very
reticent
who
wore
glasses
spoke
with
just
a
slight
foreign
accent
and
who
seldom
entered
any
and
who
scarcely
ever
passed
the
time
of
day
with
his
neighbours
yet
he
was
evidently
well
off
for
on
several
occasions
on
hearing
of
distress
among
the
families
living
in
that
street
he
had
surreptitiously
visited
them
and
dispensed
charity
to
a
no
mean
degree
apparently
it
is
this
which
has
inspired
respect
while
in
addition
he
seems
to
have
purposely
surrounded
his
identity
by
mystery
with
some
object
no
doubt
i
remarked
certainly
was
the
queer
old
man
response
all
my
inquiries
tend
to
show
he
is
a
man
of
secrecy
and
that
he
is
concealing
his
real
identity
it
may
be
that
he
keeps
those
rooms
merely
as
an
address
for
letters
i
suggested
do
you
know
signore
that
is
my
own
opinion
he
said
he
may
live
in
another
part
of
florence
for
aught
we
know
we
must
find
out
before
i
leave
here
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
know
all
about
him
therefore
i
will
assist
you
to
watch
for
his
return
babbo
shook
his
head
and
fingered
his
long
cigar
which
he
was
longing
to
smoke
no
signore
you
must
not
appear
in
the
via
san
cristofana
they
would
note
your
presence
instantly
leave
all
to
me
i
will
employ
an
assistant
and
we
shall
i
hope
before
long
be
shadowing
this
mysterious
individual
recollecting
that
strange
letter
in
italian
which
i
had
secured
from
the
dead
man
effects
i
asked
the
old
fellow
if
he
knew
any
place
called
san
frediano
the
place
appointed
for
the
meeting
between
the
man
now
dead
and
the
writer
of
the
letter
certainly
was
his
reply
there
is
the
market
of
san
frediano
behind
the
carmine
and
of
course
there
is
the
church
of
san
frediano
in
lucca
in
lucca
i
echoed
ah
but
it
is
not
florence
nevertheless
now
i
recollected
the
letter
distinctly
appointed
the
hour
of
meeting
at
vespers
the
place
arranged
was
therefore
most
certainly
a
church
do
you
know
of
any
other
church
of
san
frediano
i
inquired
only
the
one
in
lucca
it
was
evident
then
that
the
meeting
was
to
take
place
there
on
the
of
march
if
i
did
not
ascertain
any
further
facts
concerning
paolo
melandrini
in
the
meantime
i
resolved
to
keep
the
appointment
and
watch
who
should
be
present
i
gave
carlini
permission
to
smoke
and
seated
in
a
low
the
old
fellow
soon
filled
my
room
with
the
strong
fumes
of
his
cheap
cigar
at
the
same
time
relating
to
me
in
narrow
details
all
that
he
had
gathered
in
that
florentine
slum
the
secret
connexion
between
burton
blair
and
this
mysterious
italian
was
a
problem
i
could
not
solve
there
was
evidently
some
strong
motive
why
he
should
appoint
him
controller
of
mabel
fortune
yet
it
was
all
an
utter
enigma
just
as
much
as
the
mysterious
source
from
which
the
millionaire
had
obtained
his
vast
wealth
whatever
we
discovered
i
knew
that
it
must
be
some
strange
revelation
from
the
first
moment
i
had
met
the
wayfarer
and
his
daughter
they
had
been
surrounded
by
striking
romance
which
had
now
deepened
and
become
more
inexplicable
by
the
death
of
that
bluff
hearty
man
with
a
secret
i
could
not
help
strongly
suspecting
that
the
man
melandrini
whose
movements
were
so
mysterious
and
suspicious
had
had
some
hand
in
filching
from
blair
that
curious
little
possession
of
his
which
he
had
in
his
will
bequeathed
to
my
keeping
this
was
a
strange
fancy
of
mine
and
one
which
try
how
i
would
i
could
not
put
aside
so
erratic
seemed
the
man
movements
that
for
aught
i
knew
he
might
have
been
in
england
at
the
time
of
blair
death
if
so
then
the
suspicion
against
him
was
gravely
increased
i
was
feverishly
anxious
to
return
to
london
but
unable
yet
to
do
so
ere
my
inquiries
were
completed
a
whole
week
went
by
and
carlini
employing
his
a
young
man
of
low
class
as
his
assistant
kept
vigilant
watch
upon
the
house
both
night
and
day
but
to
no
avail
paolo
melandrini
did
not
appear
to
claim
the
letter
from
england
that
was
awaiting
him
one
evening
by
judiciously
bribing
the
old
servant
with
twenty
francs
carlini
obtained
the
letter
in
question
and
brought
it
for
me
to
see
in
the
privacy
of
my
room
we
boiled
a
kettle
steamed
the
flap
of
the
envelope
and
took
out
the
sheet
of
notepaper
it
contained
it
was
from
blair
dated
from
grosvenor
square
eighteen
days
before
it
was
in
english
and
read
as
follows
will
meet
you
if
you
really
wish
it
i
will
bring
out
the
papers
with
me
and
trust
in
you
to
employ
persons
who
know
how
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
my
address
in
reply
will
be
john
marshall
grand
hotel
the
mystery
increased
why
did
blair
wish
for
the
employment
of
persons
who
would
remain
silent
what
was
the
nature
of
the
work
that
was
so
very
confidential
evidently
blair
took
every
precaution
in
receiving
communications
from
the
italian
causing
him
to
address
his
letters
in
various
names
to
various
hotels
whither
he
went
to
stay
a
night
and
thus
claim
them
mabel
had
often
told
me
of
her
father
frequent
absences
from
home
he
sometimes
being
away
a
week
or
fortnight
or
even
three
weeks
without
leaving
his
address
behind
his
erratic
movements
were
now
accounted
for
consumed
by
anxiety
i
waited
day
after
day
spending
hours
on
that
maddening
cipher
on
the
until
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
carlini
having
been
unsuccessful
in
florence
i
took
him
with
me
up
to
the
old
city
of
lucca
which
travelling
by
way
of
pistoja
we
reached
about
two
in
the
afternoon
at
the
i
was
given
that
enormous
bedroom
with
the
wonderful
frescoes
which
was
for
so
long
occupied
by
ruskin
and
just
before
the
ave
maria
clanged
away
over
the
hills
and
plains
i
parted
from
babbo
and
strolled
into
the
magnificent
old
mediaeval
church
the
darkness
of
which
was
illuminated
only
by
the
candles
burning
at
the
side
altars
and
the
cluster
before
the
statue
of
our
lady
vespers
were
in
progress
and
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
great
interior
was
only
broken
by
the
low
murmuring
of
the
bowed
priest
only
about
a
dozen
persons
were
present
all
of
them
being
women
all
save
one
a
man
who
standing
back
in
the
shadow
behind
one
of
the
huge
circular
columns
was
waiting
there
in
patience
while
of
the
others
all
were
kneeling
turning
suddenly
on
hearing
my
light
footstep
upon
the
marble
flags
i
met
him
next
second
face
to
face
i
drew
a
quick
breath
then
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
in
blank
and
utter
amazement
the
mystery
was
far
greater
than
even
i
had
imagined
it
to
be
the
truth
that
dawned
upon
me
was
staggering
and
utterly
bewildering
chapter
eight
in
which
the
truth
is
spoken
the
fine
old
church
with
its
heavy
gildings
its
tawdry
altars
and
its
magnificent
frescoes
was
in
such
gloom
that
at
first
on
entering
from
the
street
i
could
distinguish
nothing
plainly
but
as
soon
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
i
saw
within
a
few
yards
of
me
a
countenance
that
was
distinctly
familiar
a
face
that
caused
me
to
pause
in
anxious
breathlessness
standing
there
behind
those
scattered
kneeling
women
with
the
faint
flickering
light
of
the
altar
candles
illuminating
his
face
just
sufficiently
the
man
head
was
bowed
in
reverence
and
yet
his
dark
beady
eyes
seemed
darting
everywhere
by
his
features
those
hard
rather
sinister
features
and
greyish
scraggy
beard
that
i
had
once
before
seen
i
knew
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
made
the
secret
appointment
with
burton
blair
yet
contrary
to
my
expectations
he
was
attired
in
the
rough
brown
habit
and
rope
girdle
of
a
capuchin
lay
brother
a
silent
mournful
figure
as
he
stood
with
folded
arms
while
the
priest
in
his
gorgeous
vestments
mumbled
the
prayers
in
that
twilight
a
sepulchral
chill
fell
upon
my
shoulders
the
sweet
smell
of
the
incense
in
the
darkness
seemed
to
increase
with
that
world
of
incredible
magnificence
of
solitude
gloomily
enchanted
of
wealth
strangely
incongruous
with
the
squalor
and
poverty
in
the
piazza
outside
beyond
that
silent
monk
whose
piercing
mysterious
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
so
inquiringly
were
dark
receding
distances
traversed
here
and
there
by
rainbow
beams
that
fell
from
some
great
window
while
far
off
a
dim
red
light
was
suspended
from
the
high
vaulted
roof
those
columns
beside
which
i
was
standing
rose
straight
to
the
roof
close
and
thick
like
high
forest
trees
testifying
to
the
patient
work
of
a
whole
generation
of
men
all
carved
in
living
stone
all
infinitely
durable
in
spite
of
such
rare
delicacy
and
already
transmitted
to
us
from
afar
through
the
centuries
the
monk
that
man
whose
bearded
face
i
had
seen
once
before
in
england
had
thrown
himself
upon
his
knees
and
was
mumbling
to
himself
and
fingering
the
huge
rosary
suspended
from
his
girdle
a
woman
dressed
in
black
with
the
black
of
the
lucchesi
over
her
head
had
entered
noiselessly
and
was
prostrated
a
few
feet
from
me
she
held
a
miserable
baby
at
her
breast
a
child
but
a
few
months
old
in
whose
shrivelled
little
face
there
was
already
the
stamp
of
death
she
was
praying
ardently
for
him
as
the
tapers
gradually
diminished
the
penny
tapers
she
had
placed
before
the
humble
picture
of
antonio
this
sorrowing
creature
the
contrast
between
the
prodigious
wealth
around
and
the
rags
of
the
humble
supplicant
was
overwhelming
and
cruel
between
the
persistent
durability
of
those
many
thousand
saints
draped
in
gold
and
the
frailty
of
that
little
being
with
no
tomorrow
the
woman
was
still
kneeling
her
lips
moving
in
obstinate
and
vain
repetitions
she
looked
at
me
her
eyes
full
of
desolation
divining
a
pity
no
doubt
in
mine
then
she
turned
her
gaze
upon
the
hooded
capuchin
the
bearded
man
who
held
the
key
to
the
secret
of
burton
blair
i
stood
behind
the
ponderous
column
bowed
but
watchful
the
poor
woman
after
a
quick
glance
at
the
splendour
around
turned
her
eyes
more
anxiously
upon
me
a
stranger
did
i
really
think
they
would
listen
to
her
those
magnificent
divinities
ah
i
did
not
know
if
they
would
listen
in
her
place
i
would
rather
have
carried
the
child
to
one
of
those
wayside
shrines
where
the
virgin
of
the
reigns
the
madonnas
and
saints
of
ghirlandajo
and
civitali
and
della
querica
who
inhabited
that
magnificent
old
church
seemed
somehow
to
be
creatures
of
ceremony
hardened
by
secular
pomp
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
could
not
imagine
that
they
would
occupy
themselves
with
a
poor
old
woman
from
the
olive
mill
or
with
her
deformed
and
dying
child
vespers
ended
the
dark
murmuring
figures
rose
shuffling
away
over
the
marble
floor
towards
the
door
and
as
the
lights
were
quickly
extinguished
the
woman
and
her
child
became
swallowed
up
in
the
gloom
i
loitered
desiring
that
the
capuchin
should
pass
me
in
order
that
i
could
obtain
a
further
view
of
him
should
i
address
him
or
should
i
remain
silent
and
set
babbo
to
watch
him
he
approached
me
slowly
his
big
hands
hidden
in
the
ample
sleeves
of
his
habit
the
garment
which
men
of
his
order
have
new
only
once
in
ten
years
and
which
they
wear
always
waking
or
sleeping
i
had
halted
before
the
ancient
tomb
of
santa
zita
that
patroness
of
lucca
whom
dante
mentions
in
his
in
the
little
chapel
a
single
light
was
burning
in
the
great
antique
lantern
of
gold
which
the
proud
lucchese
placed
there
ages
ago
when
the
black
plague
was
feared
as
i
turned
i
saw
that
although
watching
me
narrowly
he
still
seemed
to
be
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the
man
who
was
now
alas
no
more
yes
now
that
in
a
better
light
i
could
see
his
features
i
had
no
hesitation
in
pronouncing
him
to
be
the
same
man
i
had
met
a
year
ago
at
burton
table
in
grosvenor
square
i
recollected
the
occasion
well
it
was
in
june
in
the
height
of
the
london
season
and
blair
had
invited
me
to
dine
with
several
bachelor
friends
and
go
to
the
empire
afterwards
the
man
now
in
a
religious
habit
shuffling
along
in
his
sandals
had
presented
the
very
different
figure
of
the
prosperous
with
a
fine
diamond
in
his
and
a
particularly
dinner
jacket
burton
had
introduced
him
to
us
as
signor
salvi
the
celebrated
engineer
and
he
had
sat
at
table
opposite
me
and
chatted
in
excellent
english
he
struck
me
as
a
man
who
had
travelled
very
widely
especially
in
the
far
east
and
from
certain
expressions
he
let
drop
i
concluded
that
like
burton
blair
he
had
been
to
sea
and
that
he
was
a
friend
of
the
old
days
before
the
great
secret
became
so
profitable
the
other
men
present
on
that
occasion
were
all
acquaintances
of
mine
two
of
them
financiers
in
the
city
whose
names
were
well
known
on
the
stock
exchange
a
third
the
heir
to
an
earldom
to
which
he
had
since
succeeded
and
the
fourth
sir
charles
webb
a
smart
young
guardsman
of
the
modern
type
after
a
dinner
of
that
exquisite
character
of
which
burton
blair
french
was
famous
we
all
drove
to
the
empire
and
afterwards
spent
a
couple
of
hours
at
the
grosvenor
club
concluding
the
evening
at
the
bachelors
of
which
sir
charles
was
a
member
now
as
i
stood
within
the
hushed
gloom
of
that
grand
old
church
watching
the
dark
mysterious
figure
pacing
the
aisle
in
patience
and
awaiting
the
person
who
would
never
come
i
recollected
what
had
on
that
evening
long
ago
aroused
within
me
a
curious
feeling
of
resentment
against
him
it
was
this
having
left
the
empire
we
were
standing
outside
on
the
pavement
in
leicester
square
calling
cabs
when
i
overheard
the
italian
exclaim
in
his
own
language
to
blair
i
do
not
like
that
friend
of
yours
greenwood
he
is
far
too
inquisitive
at
this
my
friend
laughed
saying
ah
you
do
know
him
he
is
my
very
best
friend
the
italian
grunted
replying
he
has
been
putting
leading
questions
to
me
all
the
evening
and
i
have
had
to
lie
to
him
again
blair
laughed
it
is
not
the
first
time
committed
that
sin
was
his
answer
no
the
other
responded
in
a
low
voice
intending
that
i
should
not
overhear
him
but
if
you
introduce
me
to
your
friends
be
careful
that
they
are
not
quite
so
astute
or
so
inquisitive
as
this
man
greenwood
he
may
be
a
good
fellow
but
even
if
he
is
he
surely
must
not
know
our
secret
if
he
did
it
might
mean
ruin
to
us
remember
and
then
before
blair
could
make
response
he
mounted
into
a
hansom
which
at
that
moment
had
pulled
up
at
the
kerb
from
that
moment
i
had
entertained
a
distinct
dislike
of
the
man
who
had
been
introduced
to
me
as
salvi
not
that
i
hold
every
foreigner
in
suspicion
as
some
insular
englishmen
so
foolishly
do
but
because
he
had
endeavoured
to
poison
blair
mind
against
me
yet
after
a
week
the
incident
had
entirely
slipped
my
memory
and
i
had
never
recollected
it
until
that
strange
and
unexpected
was
it
possible
that
this
monk
with
the
bearded
face
was
the
same
man
who
rented
that
apartment
in
the
florence
slum
and
whose
visits
there
were
so
surreptitious
and
mysterious
perhaps
so
because
all
the
secrecy
of
his
habitation
would
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
a
capuchin
is
not
allowed
to
possess
any
property
outside
his
monastery
those
infrequent
visits
to
florence
might
be
made
at
times
when
being
a
lay
brother
he
would
no
doubt
be
sent
out
into
the
country
to
collect
from
the
alms
and
presents
in
kind
for
the
poor
in
the
city
everywhere
throughout
tuscany
in
peasant
hut
as
in
prince
palace
the
humble
patient
and
charitable
capuchin
is
welcomed
a
flask
of
wine
and
a
crust
is
ready
for
him
at
the
house
of
every
and
in
the
villas
and
palaces
of
the
rich
there
is
always
a
place
for
him
in
the
servants
hall
how
many
of
the
italian
poor
are
saved
annually
from
sheer
starvation
by
the
soup
and
bread
dispensed
daily
at
the
door
of
every
capuchin
monastery
it
would
be
impossible
to
estimate
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
order
in
their
habits
and
their
black
is
the
greatest
and
truest
friend
the
starving
poor
possesses
babbo
carlini
was
no
doubt
idling
outside
upon
the
steps
of
the
church
awaiting
my
reappearance
would
he
i
wondered
recognise
in
this
monk
the
description
he
had
obtained
of
paolo
melandrini
the
unknown
man
who
was
to
be
mabel
blair
secretary
and
adviser
the
last
loiterers
in
the
antique
chapel
of
the
holy
sacrament
had
left
their
footsteps
echoing
away
across
the
flags
to
the
exit
and
i
found
myself
alone
with
the
silent
almost
statuesque
man
beside
whom
i
had
only
one
year
before
stood
in
the
grand
circle
at
the
empire
watching
and
criticising
a
ballet
should
i
address
him
and
claim
acquaintance
his
disapproval
of
myself
caused
me
to
hesitate
it
was
quite
apparent
that
he
had
held
me
in
apprehension
on
that
night
at
grosvenor
square
therefore
in
the
present
circumstances
his
suspicion
would
undoubtedly
become
increased
should
i
boldly
address
him
and
thus
show
my
fearlessness
as
well
as
my
acquaintance
with
his
subterfuges
or
should
i
withdraw
and
watch
his
subsequent
movements
i
at
length
decided
on
the
former
course
for
two
reasons
the
first
was
that
i
felt
confident
he
had
recognised
me
as
burton
friend
and
the
second
because
in
dealing
with
such
a
man
the
open
declaration
of
knowledge
is
always
the
more
advantageous
in
the
end
than
the
careful
concealment
of
such
facts
as
i
already
knew
if
i
set
a
watch
upon
him
his
suspicions
would
become
heightened
whereas
if
i
acted
openly
i
might
succeed
in
disarming
him
therefore
turning
upon
my
heel
i
strolled
straight
towards
where
he
had
halted
as
though
he
were
patiently
awaiting
blair
arrival
pardon
me
signore
i
exclaimed
in
italian
but
if
i
mistake
not
we
have
met
before
in
london
a
year
ago
was
it
not
ah
he
exclaimed
his
face
relaxing
into
a
pleasant
smile
as
he
extended
his
big
hard
hand
i
have
been
wondering
all
this
time
signor
greenwood
if
you
would
recognise
me
is
this
dress
i
am
very
pleased
to
resume
our
acquaintance
very
and
he
emphasised
his
words
meant
or
feigned
by
a
strong
close
grip
i
expressed
surprise
at
finding
the
erratic
traveller
and
to
be
in
reality
an
inhabitant
of
the
cloister
to
which
in
a
low
voice
in
reverence
that
we
were
within
that
sacred
place
he
responded
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
later
it
is
not
so
remarkable
as
it
no
doubt
strikes
you
as
a
capuchin
i
assure
you
my
quiet
reflective
life
is
far
preferable
to
that
of
the
man
who
like
yourself
mixes
with
the
world
and
is
compelled
to
live
the
fevered
life
of
wherein
fortunate
unscrupulousness
is
accounted
meritorious
and
the
greatest
of
sins
is
that
of
one
evil
living
being
found
out
yes
i
quite
understand
i
replied
surprised
nevertheless
at
his
assertion
and
wondering
whether
after
all
he
was
merely
attempting
to
mislead
me
the
life
of
the
cloister
must
be
one
of
a
sweet
and
infinite
calm
but
if
i
mistake
not
i
added
you
are
here
by
appointment
to
meet
our
mutual
friend
burton
blair
he
raised
his
dark
eyebrows
slightly
and
i
could
have
sworn
that
my
words
caused
him
to
start
yet
so
cleverly
did
he
conceal
any
surprise
i
had
caused
him
that
he
replied
in
a
quiet
natural
tone
that
is
so
i
am
here
to
see
him
then
i
regret
to
tell
you
that
you
will
never
see
him
again
i
said
in
a
low
earnest
voice
why
he
gasped
his
black
eyes
wide
open
in
surprise
because
i
answered
because
poor
burton
blair
is
dead
and
his
secret
has
been
stolen
what
he
cried
with
a
look
of
abject
terror
and
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
his
exclamation
echoed
along
the
high
vaulted
roof
blair
dead
and
the
secret
stolen
impossible
impossible
chapter
nine
the
house
of
silence
the
effect
of
my
words
upon
the
burly
capuchin
whose
form
seemed
almost
gigantic
on
account
of
the
thickness
of
his
inartistic
habit
was
as
curious
as
it
was
unexpected
my
announcement
of
blair
death
seemed
to
completely
unnerve
him
apparently
he
had
been
waiting
there
keeping
the
appointment
all
unconscious
of
the
untimely
end
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
been
on
terms
of
such
secret
and
intimate
friendship
tell
me
tell
me
how
it
happened
he
gasped
in
italian
in
a
low
hushed
voice
as
though
he
feared
that
some
eavesdropper
might
be
lurking
in
those
dark
recesses
in
a
few
brief
words
i
explained
the
truth
to
which
he
listened
in
silence
then
when
i
had
finished
he
muttered
something
crossed
himself
and
as
the
approaching
footsteps
of
the
sacristan
aroused
us
both
we
walked
forward
and
out
into
the
dusk
of
the
broad
piazza
old
carlini
was
was
lounging
upon
a
bench
smoking
the
end
of
a
cigar
noticed
us
in
an
instant
and
i
saw
him
open
his
eyes
in
wonderment
although
further
than
that
he
betrayed
no
sign
poverino
poverino
repeated
the
monk
as
we
strolled
together
slowly
beside
the
old
red
walls
of
the
city
to
think
that
our
poor
friend
burton
died
so
suddenly
and
without
a
word
not
exactly
without
a
word
i
said
he
gave
several
directions
one
of
which
was
that
he
placed
his
daughter
mabel
beneath
my
care
ah
the
little
mabel
he
sighed
surely
it
is
ten
years
since
i
saw
her
in
manchester
she
was
then
about
eleven
a
tall
rather
pretty
child
a
striking
likeness
of
her
mother
poor
woman
you
knew
her
mother
then
i
asked
in
some
surprise
he
nodded
in
the
affirmative
but
gave
no
further
information
suddenly
turning
to
me
as
we
walked
towards
the
city
gate
the
ponto
santa
maria
where
the
uniformed
officers
of
the
were
lounging
ready
to
tax
every
pennyworth
of
entering
there
he
demanded
how
did
you
know
that
i
had
an
appointment
with
our
friend
by
the
letter
which
you
wrote
him
and
which
was
found
in
his
bag
after
his
decease
i
responded
frankly
he
grunted
with
distinct
satisfaction
it
struck
me
indeed
as
though
he
were
apprehensive
that
burton
had
before
his
death
told
me
some
details
regarding
his
life
i
recollected
that
curious
cipher
upon
the
although
i
made
no
reference
to
it
ah
i
see
he
exclaimed
presently
but
if
that
little
wallet
or
whatever
it
was
that
he
always
wore
either
concealed
within
his
clothes
or
suspended
around
his
neck
is
missing
does
not
it
point
to
a
tragedy
theft
and
murder
there
are
distinct
suspicions
was
my
reply
although
according
to
the
doctors
he
died
from
a
purely
natural
cause
ah
i
do
believe
it
cried
the
monk
fiercely
clenching
his
fist
one
of
them
has
succeeded
at
last
in
stealing
that
sachet
of
which
he
was
always
so
very
careful
and
i
positive
that
murder
has
been
committed
in
order
to
conceal
the
theft
one
of
whom
i
inquired
anxiously
one
of
his
enemies
but
are
you
aware
what
that
little
bag
contained
he
never
would
tell
me
was
the
capuchin
reply
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
he
only
said
that
his
secret
was
concealed
within
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
such
was
a
fact
but
you
knew
his
secret
i
said
my
eyes
full
upon
him
i
noted
by
the
change
in
his
dark
countenance
how
my
allegation
caused
him
quick
apprehension
he
could
not
totally
deny
it
yet
he
was
certainly
seeking
some
means
of
misleading
me
i
only
know
what
he
explained
to
me
he
responded
and
that
was
not
much
for
as
you
are
aware
he
was
a
most
reticent
man
he
has
long
ago
related
to
me
however
the
somewhat
romantic
circumstances
in
which
you
met
what
a
good
friend
you
were
to
him
before
his
stroke
of
fortune
and
how
you
and
your
friend
i
forget
his
name
put
mabel
to
school
at
bournemouth
and
thus
rescued
her
from
that
weary
tramp
which
burton
himself
had
undertaken
but
why
was
he
on
tramp
in
that
manner
i
asked
to
me
it
has
always
been
an
enigma
and
also
to
me
he
was
i
believe
in
search
of
the
key
to
that
secret
which
he
carried
with
him
the
secret
which
you
say
he
has
bequeathed
to
you
did
he
reveal
to
you
nothing
more
i
inquired
recollecting
that
from
this
man
remarks
regarding
mabel
youth
he
and
blair
must
have
been
old
friends
nothing
his
secret
remained
his
own
and
he
revealed
it
to
nobody
always
fearing
betrayal
but
now
that
it
is
in
other
hands
what
do
you
anticipate
i
inquired
still
walking
at
his
side
for
we
had
passed
out
of
the
city
and
were
out
upon
that
wide
dirty
road
that
led
away
to
the
moriano
bridge
and
then
fifteen
miles
up
into
the
mountains
to
that
leafy
and
rather
gay
summer
resort
well
known
to
all
italians
and
some
english
the
baths
of
lucca
well
responded
my
companion
very
gravely
from
what
i
learned
in
london
on
the
occasion
we
met
i
anticipate
that
poor
blair
secret
has
been
most
ingeniously
stolen
and
will
be
put
to
good
account
by
the
person
into
whose
possession
it
has
now
passed
to
the
detriment
of
his
daughter
mabel
most
certainly
she
must
be
the
principal
sufferer
he
replied
with
just
a
suspicion
of
a
sigh
ah
if
he
had
only
confided
his
affairs
in
some
one
who
knowing
the
truth
might
have
combated
this
cunning
conspiracy
but
as
it
is
we
seem
all
utterly
in
the
dark
even
his
lawyers
know
nothing
and
you
to
whom
the
secret
is
left
have
actually
lost
it
he
added
yes
signore
the
situation
is
indeed
a
most
critical
one
in
this
affair
signor
salvi
i
said
being
mutual
friends
of
poor
blair
we
must
endeavour
to
do
our
best
to
discover
and
punish
his
enemies
tell
me
therefore
if
you
are
aware
of
the
source
of
our
unfortunate
friend
vast
wealth
i
am
not
signor
salvi
here
was
the
monk
quiet
reply
i
am
known
as
fra
antonio
of
arezzo
or
fra
antonio
for
short
the
name
of
salvi
was
given
to
me
by
poor
blair
himself
who
did
not
wish
to
introduce
a
capuchin
among
his
worldly
friends
as
such
as
to
the
source
of
his
wealth
i
believe
i
am
acquainted
with
the
truth
then
tell
me
tell
me
i
cried
anxiously
for
it
may
give
us
the
clue
to
these
persons
who
had
so
successfully
conspired
against
him
again
the
monk
turned
his
dark
penetrating
eyes
upon
me
those
eyes
that
in
the
gloom
of
san
frediano
had
seemed
so
full
of
fire
and
yet
so
full
of
mystery
no
he
answered
in
a
hard
decisive
tone
i
am
not
permitted
to
tell
anything
he
is
dead
let
his
memory
rest
but
why
i
demanded
in
these
circumstances
of
grave
suspicion
and
of
the
theft
of
the
secret
which
is
my
property
by
right
it
is
surely
your
duty
to
explain
what
you
know
in
order
that
we
may
gain
a
clue
recollect
too
that
the
future
of
his
daughter
depends
upon
the
truth
being
revealed
i
can
tell
you
nothing
he
repeated
much
as
i
regret
it
my
lips
are
sealed
why
by
an
oath
taken
years
ago
before
i
entered
the
order
of
the
capuchins
he
responded
then
after
a
pause
he
added
with
a
sigh
it
is
all
strange
stranger
perhaps
than
any
man
has
dreamed
yet
i
can
tell
you
nothing
greenwood
absolutely
nothing
i
was
silent
his
words
were
highly
tantalising
as
well
as
disappointing
i
had
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
whether
he
was
actually
my
enemy
or
my
friend
at
one
moment
he
seemed
simple
honest
and
straightforward
as
are
all
men
of
his
religious
order
yet
at
others
there
seemed
within
him
that
craft
and
cunning
that
clever
diplomacy
and
acumen
of
the
jesuit
traits
of
a
character
warped
into
ingenuity
and
the
very
fact
that
burton
blair
had
always
hidden
from
me
his
friendship
if
friendship
it
were
for
this
stalwart
monk
with
the
bronzed
and
furrowed
face
caused
me
to
entertain
a
kind
of
vague
distrust
in
him
and
yet
when
i
recollected
the
tone
of
the
letter
he
had
written
to
blair
how
could
i
doubt
but
their
friendship
if
secret
was
a
real
and
genuine
one
nevertheless
i
recollected
those
words
i
had
overheard
on
the
pavement
of
leicester
square
and
they
caused
me
to
ponder
and
to
doubt
i
walked
on
beside
this
man
heedless
of
our
destination
we
were
quite
in
the
country
now
the
immobility
of
everything
the
luminous
brilliancy
of
the
tints
of
that
winter
afterglow
gave
the
grey
tuscan
hills
something
of
sadness
that
great
calm
silence
over
everything
that
unchanging
stillness
in
the
air
those
motionless
lights
and
great
shadows
gave
one
the
impression
of
a
pause
in
the
dizzy
movement
of
centuries
of
a
reflectiveness
of
an
intense
waiting
or
rather
a
look
of
melancholy
thrown
back
on
a
past
anterior
to
suns
and
human
beings
races
and
religions
before
us
as
we
rounded
a
bend
in
the
road
i
saw
a
huge
white
old
monastery
standing
high
upon
the
hillside
half
hidden
by
the
trees
it
was
the
convent
of
the
cappuccini
he
told
me
his
home
i
halted
for
a
moment
gazing
upon
the
white
almost
windowless
building
scorched
by
three
hundred
summers
standing
like
a
stronghold
as
once
it
was
against
the
background
of
the
purple
apennines
i
listened
to
the
clanking
of
the
old
bell
that
sent
out
its
summons
with
the
same
note
of
age
the
same
old
voice
as
in
centuries
gone
it
was
then
in
that
moment
that
the
charm
of
lucca
and
her
beautiful
surroundings
became
impressed
upon
me
i
felt
for
the
first
time
stealing
up
from
everywhere
an
atmosphere
of
separateness
as
it
were
from
the
rest
of
the
world
of
mystery
a
living
essence
of
what
the
place
is
destructible
alas
but
still
impregnating
all
things
exhaling
from
all
things
surely
the
dying
soul
of
tuscany
and
there
beside
me
overwhelming
all
my
thoughts
as
the
shadow
of
the
giant
sphinx
falls
lengthening
upon
the
desert
sands
stood
that
big
bronzed
monk
in
the
faded
brown
habit
his
feet
bare
his
waist
bound
by
a
hempen
cord
his
countenance
a
mystery
yet
within
his
heart
the
great
secret
which
no
power
could
induce
him
to
divulge
the
secret
of
wealth
that
had
been
bequeathed
to
me
poor
blair
is
dead
he
repeated
again
and
again
in
fairly
good
english
as
though
almost
unable
as
yet
to
realise
that
his
friend
was
no
more
nevertheless
i
was
slow
to
become
convinced
that
he
spoke
seriously
he
might
be
misleading
me
after
all
at
his
invitation
i
accompanied
him
up
the
steep
winding
road
until
we
came
to
the
ponderous
gate
of
the
monastery
at
which
he
rang
a
solemn
bell
clanged
loudly
and
a
few
moments
later
the
little
grille
was
opened
revealing
the
face
of
the
janitor
who
instantly
admitted
us
he
took
me
across
the
silent
cloister
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
wonderful
mediaeval
well
of
wrought
ironwork
and
then
along
endless
stone
corridors
each
lit
by
its
single
oil
lamp
which
rendered
the
place
only
more
gloomy
and
depressing
from
the
chapel
at
the
end
of
the
great
building
came
the
low
chanting
of
the
monks
but
beyond
the
quiet
was
that
of
the
grave
the
dark
ghostly
figures
passed
us
noiselessly
and
seemed
to
draw
aside
into
the
darkness
the
door
of
the
refectory
stood
open
showing
by
the
two
or
three
dim
lights
magnificent
carvings
wonderful
frescoes
and
the
two
long
rows
of
oak
benches
at
which
the
brothers
sat
at
meals
suddenly
my
conductor
stopped
before
a
small
door
which
he
opened
with
his
key
and
i
found
myself
within
a
tiny
carpetless
cubicle
containing
a
truckle
bed
a
chair
a
bookcase
and
a
upon
the
wall
was
a
large
wooden
crucifix
before
which
he
crossed
himself
on
entering
this
is
my
home
he
explained
in
english
not
very
luxurious
it
is
true
but
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
a
palace
in
the
world
outside
here
we
are
all
brothers
with
the
superior
as
our
father
to
supply
us
with
all
our
worldly
wants
even
to
our
snuff
there
are
no
jealousies
no
bickerings
no
backbitings
or
rivalry
all
are
equal
all
perfectly
contented
for
we
have
each
one
of
us
learnt
the
very
difficult
lesson
of
brotherly
love
and
he
drew
the
single
chair
for
me
to
seat
myself
for
i
was
hot
and
tired
after
that
long
steep
ascent
from
the
town
it
is
surely
a
hard
life
i
observed
at
first
yes
one
must
be
strong
in
body
and
in
mind
to
successfully
pass
the
period
of
probation
he
answered
but
afterwards
the
capuchin
life
is
surely
one
of
the
pleasantest
on
earth
banded
as
we
are
to
do
good
and
to
exercise
charity
in
the
name
of
sant
antonio
but
he
added
with
a
smile
i
did
not
bring
you
here
signore
to
endeavour
to
convert
you
from
your
protestant
faith
i
asked
you
to
accompany
me
because
you
have
told
me
what
is
a
profound
and
remarkable
mystery
you
have
told
me
of
the
death
of
burton
blair
the
man
who
was
my
friend
and
to
whose
advantage
it
was
to
meet
me
in
san
frediano
there
were
reasons
the
very
strongest
reasons
a
man
could
have
why
he
should
have
kept
the
appointment
but
he
has
not
done
so
his
enemies
have
willed
it
otherwise
and
they
have
stolen
his
secret
while
he
spoke
he
fumbled
in
a
drawer
of
the
little
deal
and
drew
forth
something
adding
in
deep
earnestness
you
knew
poor
blair
intimately
more
intimately
perhaps
than
i
did
of
later
years
you
knew
his
enemies
as
well
as
his
friends
tell
me
have
you
ever
met
the
original
of
either
of
these
men
and
he
held
before
my
gaze
two
cabinet
photographs
one
of
them
was
quite
unfamiliar
to
me
but
the
other
i
recognised
in
an
instant
why
i
said
that
my
old
friend
reginald
seton
blair
friend
no
the
monk
declared
in
a
hard
meaning
tone
not
his
friend
signore
his
bitterest
enemy
chapter
ten
the
man
of
secrets
i
do
understand
you
i
exclaimed
resenting
this
charge
against
the
man
who
was
my
most
intimate
friend
seton
has
been
even
a
better
friend
to
poor
blair
than
myself
fra
antonio
smiled
strangely
and
mysteriously
as
only
the
subtle
italian
can
he
seemed
to
pity
my
ignorance
and
inclined
to
humour
me
in
my
belief
in
seton
genuineness
i
know
he
laughed
i
know
almost
as
much
as
you
do
upon
the
one
side
while
upon
the
other
my
knowledge
extends
somewhat
further
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
have
watched
and
have
formed
my
own
conclusions
that
seton
was
not
his
friend
that
seton
was
not
his
friend
he
repeated
slowly
and
very
distinctly
but
surely
you
make
no
direct
charge
against
him
i
cried
you
surely
do
think
he
responsible
for
this
tragedy
if
tragedy
it
really
is
i
make
no
direct
charge
was
his
ambiguous
reply
time
will
reveal
the
truth
no
doubt
i
longed
to
ask
him
straight
out
whether
he
did
not
sometimes
go
under
the
name
of
paolo
melandrini
yet
i
feared
to
do
so
lest
i
should
arouse
his
suspicion
unduly
time
can
only
reveal
that
reginald
seton
has
been
one
of
the
dead
best
friends
i
said
reflectively
outwardly
yes
was
the
capuchin
dubious
remark
an
enemy
as
deadly
as
the
ceco
i
inquired
watching
his
face
the
while
the
ceco
he
gasped
instantly
taken
aback
by
my
bold
remark
who
told
you
of
him
what
do
you
know
regarding
him
the
monk
had
evidently
forgotten
what
he
had
written
in
that
letter
to
blair
i
know
that
he
is
in
london
i
responded
taking
my
cue
from
his
own
words
the
girl
is
with
him
i
added
utterly
unaware
however
of
the
identity
of
the
person
referred
to
well
he
asked
and
if
they
are
in
london
it
is
surely
for
no
good
purpose
ah
he
said
blair
has
told
you
something
told
you
of
his
suspicions
of
late
he
has
gone
about
in
daily
dread
of
secret
assassination
i
replied
he
was
evidently
afraid
of
the
ceco
and
surely
he
had
need
to
be
exclaimed
fra
antonio
his
dark
brilliant
eyes
again
turned
upon
mine
in
the
the
ceco
is
not
an
individual
to
be
dealt
with
easily
but
what
took
him
to
london
i
demanded
did
he
go
with
harmful
intentions
the
burly
monk
shrugged
his
shoulders
answering
dick
dawson
was
never
of
a
very
benevolent
disposition
he
evidently
discovered
something
and
swore
to
be
avenged
his
remarks
made
plain
one
very
important
fact
namely
that
the
man
who
went
by
the
nickname
of
the
blind
man
in
italy
was
really
an
englishman
of
the
name
of
dick
dawson
an
adventurer
most
probably
then
you
suspect
him
of
complicity
in
the
theft
of
the
secret
i
suggested
well
as
the
little
sachet
of
chamois
leather
is
missing
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
must
have
passed
into
his
hands
and
the
girl
what
of
her
his
daughter
dolly
will
assist
him
that
plain
she
as
shrewd
as
her
father
and
possesses
a
woman
cunning
into
the
bargain
a
dangerous
girl
to
say
the
least
i
warned
poor
blair
of
them
both
he
added
suddenly
it
seemed
recollecting
his
letter
but
i
am
glad
you
have
recognised
one
of
these
photographs
his
name
is
seton
you
say
well
if
he
is
your
friend
take
my
advice
and
beware
are
you
certain
you
have
never
seen
this
other
man
a
friend
of
seton
he
asked
very
earnestly
i
carried
the
picture
in
my
hand
to
where
the
dim
oil
lamp
was
burning
and
examined
it
very
closely
it
was
a
vignette
of
a
man
wearing
a
collar
a
black
and
bow
cravat
the
stud
in
his
shirt
front
was
somewhat
peculiar
for
it
seemed
like
the
miniature
cross
of
some
foreign
order
of
chivalry
and
produced
a
rather
neat
and
novel
effect
the
eyes
were
those
of
a
keen
crafty
man
and
the
hollow
cheeks
gave
the
countenance
a
slightly
haggard
and
striking
appearance
it
was
a
face
that
to
my
recollection
i
had
never
seen
before
yet
such
were
its
peculiarities
that
they
at
once
became
photographed
indelibly
upon
my
memory
i
told
him
of
my
failure
to
recognise
who
it
was
whereupon
he
urged
when
you
return
watch
the
movements
of
your
friend
seton
and
you
will
perhaps
meet
his
friend
when
you
do
write
to
me
here
and
leave
him
to
me
and
he
replaced
the
photograph
in
the
drawer
but
as
he
did
so
my
quick
eye
detected
that
within
was
a
playing
card
the
seven
of
clubs
with
some
letters
written
upon
it
very
similar
to
those
upon
the
card
in
my
pocket
i
mentioned
it
but
he
merely
smiled
and
quickly
closed
the
drawer
yet
surely
the
fact
of
the
cipher
being
in
his
possession
was
more
than
strange
do
you
ever
travel
away
from
lucca
i
inquired
at
last
recollecting
how
i
had
met
him
at
blair
table
in
grosvenor
square
but
not
at
all
satisfied
regarding
the
discovery
of
the
inscribed
card
seldom
very
seldom
he
answered
it
is
so
difficult
to
obtain
permission
and
then
it
is
only
given
to
visit
relatives
if
there
is
any
monastery
in
the
vicinity
of
our
destination
we
must
beg
our
bed
there
in
preference
to
remaining
in
a
private
house
the
rules
sound
irksome
to
you
he
added
with
a
smile
but
i
assure
you
they
do
not
gall
us
in
the
least
they
are
beneficial
to
man
happiness
and
comfort
all
of
them
again
i
turned
the
conversation
endeavouring
to
ascertain
some
facts
concerning
the
dead
man
mysterious
secret
which
i
somehow
felt
convinced
was
known
to
him
but
all
to
no
avail
he
would
tell
me
nothing
all
he
explained
was
that
the
reason
of
the
appointment
in
lucca
that
evening
was
a
very
strong
one
and
that
if
alive
the
millionaire
would
undoubtedly
have
kept
it
he
was
in
the
habit
of
meeting
me
at
certain
intervals
either
in
the
church
of
san
frediano
or
at
other
places
in
lucca
in
pescia
or
pistoja
the
monk
said
we
generally
varied
the
place
of
meeting
from
time
to
time
and
that
of
course
accounts
for
his
mysterious
absences
from
home
i
remarked
for
his
movements
were
frequently
very
erratic
so
that
even
mabel
was
unaware
of
his
address
he
was
generally
supposed
however
to
be
in
the
north
of
england
or
in
scotland
no
one
had
any
idea
that
he
travelled
so
far
afield
as
central
italy
the
monk
statement
also
made
it
plain
that
blair
had
some
very
strong
motive
for
keeping
these
frequent
appointments
fra
antonio
his
secret
friend
had
undoubtedly
also
been
his
most
intimate
and
most
trusted
one
why
had
he
kept
this
strange
and
mysterious
friendship
from
us
all
even
from
mabel
i
gazed
upon
the
italian
hard
sunburnt
face
and
tried
to
penetrate
the
mystery
written
there
but
in
vain
no
man
can
keep
a
secret
like
the
priest
of
the
confessional
or
the
monk
in
his
cell
and
what
is
your
intention
now
that
poor
blair
is
dead
i
asked
at
length
my
intention
like
yours
is
to
discover
the
truth
he
replied
it
will
be
a
difficult
matter
no
doubt
but
i
trust
that
we
shall
in
the
end
succeed
and
that
you
will
regain
the
lost
secret
but
may
not
blair
enemies
make
use
of
it
in
the
meantime
i
queried
ah
of
course
we
can
not
prevent
that
answered
fra
antonio
we
have
to
look
to
the
future
and
allow
the
present
to
take
care
of
itself
you
in
london
will
do
your
best
to
discover
whether
blair
has
met
with
foul
play
and
at
whose
hands
while
i
here
in
italy
will
try
to
find
out
whether
there
was
any
further
motive
than
the
theft
of
the
secret
but
if
the
little
had
been
stolen
would
not
blair
himself
have
missed
it
i
suggested
he
was
quite
conscious
for
several
hours
before
he
died
he
might
have
forgotten
it
men
memories
often
fail
them
completely
in
the
hours
preceding
death
night
had
fallen
before
the
great
wooden
clappers
used
to
arouse
the
monks
to
go
to
prayers
at
two
in
the
morning
resounded
through
the
cloister
as
a
reminder
that
i
a
stranger
must
take
my
departure
fra
antonio
rose
lit
a
great
old
brass
lantern
and
conducted
me
along
those
silent
corridors
out
across
the
small
piazza
and
down
the
hillside
to
the
main
road
which
lay
straight
and
white
in
the
darkness
then
having
directed
me
on
the
road
he
grasped
my
hand
in
his
big
palm
rough
through
hard
toil
at
his
patch
of
garden
and
said
rely
upon
me
to
do
my
best
i
knew
poor
blair
yes
knew
him
better
than
you
did
signor
greenwood
i
knew
too
something
of
his
remarkable
secret
and
therefore
i
am
aware
how
strange
and
how
mysterious
are
all
the
circumstances
i
shall
work
on
here
making
inquiries
while
you
return
to
london
and
pursue
yours
i
would
however
make
the
suggestion
to
you
that
if
you
meet
dick
dawson
strike
up
a
friendship
with
him
and
with
dolly
they
are
a
strange
pair
but
friendship
with
them
may
be
profitable
what
i
exclaimed
friendship
with
the
man
whom
you
declare
was
one
of
blair
bitterest
enemies
and
why
not
is
it
not
diplomacy
to
be
well
received
in
the
camp
recollect
that
your
own
stake
in
this
affair
is
the
greatest
of
any
one
the
secret
is
bequeathed
to
you
the
secret
of
burton
blair
millions
and
i
intend
to
recover
it
i
declared
firmly
i
only
hope
you
will
signore
he
said
in
a
voice
which
to
me
sounded
full
of
a
double
meaning
i
only
hope
you
will
then
wishing
me
e
buona
fra
antonio
the
capuchin
and
man
of
secrets
turned
and
left
me
standing
in
the
dark
highway
hardly
had
i
advanced
fifty
yards
before
a
short
dark
figure
loomed
out
from
the
shadow
of
some
bushes
and
by
the
voice
that
hailed
me
i
knew
it
to
be
old
babbo
whom
i
had
believed
had
grown
tired
of
awaiting
me
he
had
however
evidently
followed
us
from
the
church
and
seeing
us
enter
the
monastery
had
patiently
awaited
my
return
has
the
signore
discovered
what
he
wished
inquired
the
old
italian
quickly
some
of
it
not
all
was
my
rejoinder
you
saw
that
monk
whom
i
met
yes
since
you
have
been
in
the
convent
i
have
made
some
inquiries
and
find
that
the
most
popular
capuchin
in
the
whole
of
lucca
is
fra
antonio
and
that
his
charitableness
is
well
known
it
is
he
who
begs
from
door
to
door
through
the
city
for
contesimi
and
lire
in
order
that
the
poor
shall
have
their
daily
soup
and
bread
report
accredits
him
with
great
wealth
which
on
entering
the
order
of
the
capuchins
he
made
over
as
a
gift
to
the
fraternity
he
is
also
known
to
have
a
friend
to
whom
he
is
very
much
attached
an
englishman
who
has
one
eye
so
badly
injured
that
he
is
known
by
the
townspeople
as
the
ceco
the
ceco
i
cried
what
have
you
discovered
regarding
him
the
keeper
of
a
little
close
to
the
gate
by
which
we
left
the
city
proved
very
communicative
like
all
her
class
she
seemed
to
greatly
admire
our
friend
the
cappuccino
she
told
me
of
the
frequent
visits
of
this
englishman
who
had
lived
so
long
in
italy
that
he
was
almost
an
italian
the
ceco
was
in
the
habit
it
seemed
of
staying
at
the
old
albergo
the
di
sometimes
accompanied
by
a
young
and
very
pretty
lady
his
daughter
where
do
they
come
from
oh
i
not
yet
been
able
to
discover
that
was
babbo
reply
it
seems
however
that
the
constant
visits
of
the
ceco
to
the
monastery
have
aroused
the
public
interest
the
people
say
that
fra
antonio
nowadays
is
not
so
active
in
his
searches
after
money
for
the
poor
now
he
is
too
much
occupied
with
his
english
friend
and
the
girl
it
is
evident
that
her
beauty
is
remarkable
even
in
lucca
this
city
of
pretty
girls
answered
the
old
man
with
a
grin
she
speaks
tuscan
perfectly
and
could
they
say
easily
pass
for
an
italian
her
back
is
not
straight
like
those
inglese
one
sees
in
the
via
tornabuoni
if
the
signore
will
pardon
the
criticism
the
old
fellow
added
apologetically
this
proof
that
dick
dawson
against
whom
the
monk
had
warned
burton
blair
was
actually
the
friend
of
the
capuchin
brother
rendered
the
situation
more
puzzling
and
more
complicated
i
recognised
in
these
frequent
consultations
a
secret
plot
against
my
friend
a
conspiracy
which
had
apparently
been
carried
to
a
successful
issue
the
girl
dolly
whoever
she
was
had
of
course
never
been
to
the
monastery
but
she
had
evidently
been
in
lucca
as
a
participator
in
the
plot
to
obtain
burton
blair
valuable
secret
the
secret
that
was
now
mine
by
law
we
there
and
then
resolved
to
make
inquiries
at
the
di
that
antique
old
hostelry
in
a
narrow
side
street
peculiarly
italian
and
which
still
prefers
to
be
designated
as
an
albergo
in
preference
to
the
modern
name
of
hotel
dick
dawson
known
as
the
ceco
was
undoubtedly
in
london
but
with
the
connivance
and
aid
of
that
crafty
and
ingenious
man
of
secrets
who
had
so
cleverly
endeavoured
to
establish
with
me
a
false
friendship
was
it
actually
this
man
who
hid
his
evil
deeds
beneath
his
shabby
religious
habit
who
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
poor
blair
and
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
that
strange
little
object
which
was
his
most
treasured
possession
i
somehow
felt
convinced
that
such
was
the
actual
truth
chapter
eleven
which
explains
the
peril
of
mabel
blair
from
inquiries
made
by
old
babbo
next
morning
at
the
of
it
appeared
quite
plain
that
richard
dawson
whoever
he
was
constantly
visited
lucca
and
always
with
the
object
of
consulting
the
popular
capuchin
brother
sometimes
the
englishman
who
spoke
italian
so
well
would
journey
up
to
the
monastery
and
remain
there
several
hours
and
at
others
fra
antonio
would
come
to
the
inn
and
there
remain
closeted
in
closest
secrecy
with
the
visitor
the
ceco
so
called
because
of
his
defective
vision
was
apparently
a
man
of
means
for
his
tips
to
the
waiters
and
maids
were
always
generous
and
when
a
guest
he
and
his
daughter
always
ordered
the
best
that
could
be
procured
they
came
from
florence
the
thought
but
of
that
he
was
not
quite
certain
the
letters
and
telegrams
he
received
securing
rooms
were
dispatched
from
various
towns
in
both
france
and
italy
which
seemed
to
show
that
they
were
constantly
travelling
that
was
all
the
information
we
could
gather
the
identity
of
the
mysterious
paolo
melandrini
was
as
yet
unproven
my
primary
object
in
travelling
to
italy
was
not
accomplished
but
i
nevertheless
felt
satisfied
that
i
had
at
last
discovered
two
of
poor
blair
most
intimate
and
yet
secret
friends
but
why
the
secrecy
when
i
recollected
how
close
had
been
our
friendship
i
felt
surprised
and
even
a
trifle
annoyed
that
he
had
concealed
the
existence
of
these
men
from
me
much
as
i
regretted
to
think
ill
of
a
friend
who
was
dead
i
could
not
suppress
a
suspicion
that
his
acquaintance
with
those
men
was
part
of
his
secret
and
that
the
latter
was
some
dishonourable
one
soon
after
midday
i
crammed
my
things
into
my
valise
and
impelled
by
a
strong
desire
to
return
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
mabel
blair
left
lucca
for
london
babbo
travelled
with
me
as
far
as
pisa
where
we
changed
he
journeying
back
to
florence
and
i
picking
up
the
express
on
its
way
through
from
rome
to
calais
while
standing
on
the
platform
at
pisa
however
the
shabby
old
man
who
had
grown
thoughtful
during
the
past
or
so
suddenly
said
a
strange
idea
has
occurred
to
me
ignore
you
will
recollect
that
i
learned
in
the
via
cristofano
that
the
signor
melandrini
wore
glasses
is
it
possible
that
he
does
so
in
florence
in
order
to
conceal
his
defective
sight
why
i
believe
so
i
cried
i
believe
you
guessed
the
truth
but
on
the
other
hand
neither
his
servant
nor
the
neighbours
suspected
him
of
being
a
foreigner
he
speaks
italian
very
well
agreed
the
old
man
but
they
said
he
had
a
slight
accent
well
i
said
excited
at
this
latest
theory
return
at
once
to
the
via
san
cristofano
and
make
further
inquiries
regarding
the
mysterious
individual
eyesight
and
his
glasses
the
old
woman
who
keeps
his
rooms
has
no
doubt
seen
him
without
his
glasses
and
can
tell
you
the
truth
signore
was
the
old
fellow
answer
and
i
then
wrote
down
for
him
my
address
in
london
to
which
he
was
to
dispatch
a
telegram
if
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
ten
minutes
later
the
roaring
express
the
limited
train
of
three
and
ran
into
the
great
vaulted
station
and
wishing
the
queer
old
babbo
farewell
i
climbed
in
and
was
allotted
my
berth
for
calais
to
describe
the
long
wearying
journey
back
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
channel
with
those
wheels
grinding
for
ever
beneath
and
the
monotony
only
broken
by
the
announcement
that
a
meal
was
ready
is
useless
you
who
read
this
curious
story
of
a
man
secret
who
have
travelled
backwards
and
forwards
over
that
steel
road
to
rome
know
well
how
wearisome
it
becomes
if
you
have
been
a
constant
traveller
between
england
and
italy
suffice
it
to
say
that
hours
after
entering
the
express
at
pisa
i
crossed
the
platform
at
charing
cross
jumped
into
a
hansom
and
drove
to
great
russell
street
reggie
was
not
yet
back
from
his
warehouse
but
on
my
table
among
a
quantity
of
letters
i
found
a
telegram
in
italian
from
babbo
it
ran
melandrini
has
left
eye
injured
undoubtedly
same
carlini
the
individual
who
was
destined
to
be
mabel
blair
secretary
and
adviser
was
her
dead
father
bitterest
enemy
the
englishman
dick
dawson
i
stood
staring
at
the
telegram
utterly
stupefied
the
strange
couplet
which
the
dead
man
had
written
in
his
will
and
urged
upon
me
to
recollect
kept
running
in
my
head
king
henry
the
eighth
was
a
knave
to
his
queens
he
one
short
of
seven
and
nine
or
ten
scenes
what
hidden
meaning
could
it
convey
the
historic
facts
of
king
marriages
and
divorces
were
known
to
me
just
as
they
were
known
to
every
english
child
throughout
the
country
yet
there
was
certainly
some
motive
why
blair
should
have
placed
the
rhyme
there
perhaps
as
a
key
to
something
but
to
what
after
a
hurried
wash
and
brush
up
for
i
was
very
dirty
and
fatigued
after
my
long
journey
i
took
a
cab
to
grosvenor
square
where
i
found
mabel
dressed
in
her
neat
black
sitting
alone
reading
in
her
own
warm
cosy
room
an
apartment
which
her
father
had
two
years
ago
fitted
tastefully
and
luxuriously
as
her
boudoir
she
sprang
to
her
feet
quickly
and
greeted
me
in
eagerness
when
the
man
announced
me
then
you
are
back
again
greenwood
she
cried
oh
i
so
very
glad
i
been
wondering
and
wondering
that
i
had
heard
no
news
of
you
where
have
you
been
in
italy
i
answered
throwing
off
my
overcoat
at
her
suggestion
and
taking
a
low
chair
near
her
i
have
been
making
inquiries
and
what
have
you
discovered
several
facts
which
tend
rather
to
increase
the
mystery
surrounding
your
poor
father
than
to
elucidate
it
i
saw
that
her
face
was
paler
than
it
had
been
when
i
left
london
and
that
she
seemed
unnerved
and
strangely
anxious
i
asked
her
why
she
had
not
gone
to
brighton
or
to
some
other
place
on
the
south
coast
as
i
had
suggested
but
she
replied
that
she
preferred
to
remain
at
home
and
that
in
truth
she
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
my
return
i
explained
to
her
in
brief
what
i
had
discovered
in
italy
of
my
meeting
with
the
capuchin
brother
and
of
our
curious
conversation
i
never
heard
my
father
speak
of
him
she
said
what
kind
of
man
is
he
i
described
him
as
best
i
could
and
told
her
how
i
had
met
him
at
dinner
there
in
their
house
during
her
absence
with
percival
in
scotland
i
thought
that
a
monk
having
once
entered
an
order
could
not
the
ordinary
garments
of
secular
life
she
remarked
neither
can
he
i
said
that
very
fact
increases
the
suspicion
against
him
combined
with
the
words
i
overheard
later
outside
the
empire
theatre
and
then
i
went
on
to
relate
the
incident
just
as
i
have
written
it
down
in
a
foregoing
chapter
she
was
silent
for
some
time
her
delicate
pointed
chin
resting
upon
her
palm
as
she
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
then
at
last
she
asked
and
what
have
you
found
out
regarding
this
mysterious
italian
in
whose
hands
my
father
has
left
me
have
you
seen
him
no
i
have
not
seen
him
mabel
was
my
response
but
i
have
discovered
that
he
is
a
englishman
and
not
an
italian
at
all
i
shall
not
i
think
be
jealous
of
his
attentions
to
you
for
he
has
a
defect
he
has
only
one
eye
only
one
eye
she
gasped
her
face
blanching
in
an
instant
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
a
man
with
one
eye
and
an
englishman
why
she
cried
you
surely
do
say
that
the
man
in
question
is
named
dawson
dick
dawson
paolo
melandrini
and
dick
dawson
are
one
and
the
same
i
said
plainly
utterly
amazed
at
the
terrifying
effect
my
words
had
had
upon
her
but
surely
my
father
has
not
left
me
in
the
hands
of
that
fiend
the
man
whose
very
name
is
synonymous
of
all
that
is
cunning
evil
and
brutal
it
ca
be
true
there
must
be
some
mistake
greenwood
there
must
be
ah
you
do
not
know
the
reputation
of
that
englishman
as
i
do
or
you
would
wish
me
dead
rather
than
see
me
in
association
with
him
you
must
save
me
she
cried
in
terror
bursting
into
a
torrent
of
tears
you
promised
to
be
my
friend
you
must
save
me
save
me
from
that
man
the
man
whose
very
touch
deals
death
and
next
instant
she
reeled
stretched
forth
her
thin
white
hands
wildly
and
would
have
fallen
senseless
to
the
floor
had
i
not
sprang
forward
and
caught
her
in
my
arms
whom
i
wondered
was
this
man
dick
dawson
that
she
held
in
such
terror
and
loathing
this
man
who
was
evidently
a
link
with
her
father
mysterious
past
chapter
twelve
richard
dawson
i
confess
that
i
was
longing
for
the
appearance
of
this
englishman
of
whom
mabel
blair
was
evidently
so
terrified
in
order
to
judge
him
for
myself
what
i
had
gathered
concerning
him
was
up
to
the
present
by
no
means
satisfactory
that
in
common
with
the
monk
he
held
the
secret
of
the
dead
man
past
seemed
practically
certain
and
perhaps
mabel
feared
some
unwelcome
revelation
concerning
her
father
actions
and
the
source
of
his
wealth
this
was
the
thought
which
occurred
to
me
when
having
raised
the
alarm
which
brought
the
faithful
companion
percival
i
was
assisting
to
apply
restoratives
to
the
insensible
girl
as
she
lay
her
head
pillowed
upon
a
cushion
of
daffodil
silk
percival
knelt
beside
her
and
being
in
ignorance
held
me
i
think
in
considerable
suspicion
she
inquired
rather
sharply
the
reason
of
mabel
unconsciousness
but
i
merely
replied
that
she
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
faintness
and
attributed
it
to
the
overheating
of
the
room
presently
when
she
came
to
she
asked
percival
and
her
maid
bowers
to
leave
us
alone
and
after
the
door
had
shut
she
inquired
and
anxious
when
is
this
man
dawson
to
come
here
when
leighton
gives
him
notice
of
the
clause
in
your
will
he
can
come
here
she
said
determinedly
but
before
he
crosses
this
threshold
i
shall
leave
the
house
he
may
act
just
as
he
thinks
proper
but
i
will
not
reside
under
the
same
roof
with
him
nor
will
i
have
any
communication
with
him
whatsoever
i
quite
understand
your
feelings
mabel
i
said
but
is
such
a
course
a
judicious
one
will
it
not
be
best
to
wait
and
watch
the
fellow
movements
ah
but
you
do
know
him
she
cried
you
do
suspect
what
i
know
to
be
the
truth
what
that
no
she
said
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
i
may
not
tell
you
you
will
discover
all
ere
long
and
then
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
i
abhor
the
very
name
of
the
man
but
why
on
earth
did
your
father
insert
such
a
clause
in
his
will
because
he
was
compelled
she
answered
hoarsely
he
could
not
help
himself
and
if
he
had
refused
refused
to
place
you
in
the
power
of
such
a
person
what
then
it
would
have
meant
his
ruin
she
answered
i
suspected
it
all
the
instant
i
heard
that
a
mysterious
man
was
to
be
my
secretary
and
to
have
control
of
my
affairs
your
discovery
in
italy
has
only
confirmed
my
suspicions
but
you
will
take
my
advice
mabel
and
bear
with
him
at
first
i
urged
wondering
within
my
heart
whether
her
hatred
of
the
man
was
because
she
knew
that
he
was
her
father
assassin
she
entertained
some
violent
dislike
of
him
but
for
what
reason
i
entirely
failed
to
discover
she
shook
her
head
at
my
argument
saying
i
regret
that
i
am
not
sufficiently
diplomatic
to
be
able
to
conceal
my
antipathy
in
that
manner
we
women
are
clever
in
many
ways
but
we
must
always
exhibit
our
dislikes
she
added
well
i
remarked
it
will
be
a
very
great
pity
to
treat
him
with
open
hostility
for
it
may
upset
all
our
future
chances
of
success
in
discovering
the
truth
regarding
your
poor
father
death
and
the
theft
of
his
secret
my
strong
advice
is
to
remain
quite
silent
apathetic
even
and
yet
with
a
keen
watchful
eye
sooner
or
later
this
man
if
he
really
is
your
enemy
must
betray
himself
then
will
be
time
enough
for
us
to
act
firmly
and
in
the
end
you
will
triumph
for
my
own
part
i
consider
that
the
sooner
leighton
gives
the
fellow
notice
of
his
appointment
the
better
but
is
there
no
way
by
which
this
can
be
avoided
she
cried
dismayed
surely
my
poor
father
death
is
sufficiently
painful
without
this
second
misfortune
she
spoke
to
me
as
frankly
as
she
would
have
done
to
a
brother
and
i
recognised
by
her
intense
manner
how
now
that
her
suspicions
were
confirmed
she
had
become
absolutely
desperate
amid
all
the
luxury
and
splendour
of
that
splendid
place
she
was
a
wan
and
lonely
figure
her
young
heart
torn
by
grief
at
her
father
death
and
by
a
terror
which
she
dare
not
divulge
there
is
an
old
and
saying
that
wealth
does
not
bring
happiness
and
surely
there
is
often
a
greater
peace
of
mind
and
pure
enjoyment
of
life
in
the
cottage
than
in
the
mansion
the
poor
are
apt
to
regard
the
rich
with
envy
yet
it
should
be
remembered
that
many
a
man
and
many
a
woman
lolling
in
a
luxurious
carriage
and
served
by
liveried
servants
looks
forth
upon
those
toilers
in
the
streets
well
knowing
that
the
hurrying
millions
of
what
they
term
the
masses
are
really
far
happier
than
they
many
a
disappointed
woman
of
title
often
young
and
beautiful
would
gladly
exchange
places
with
the
daughter
of
the
people
whose
life
if
hard
is
nevertheless
full
of
harmless
pleasures
and
as
much
happiness
as
can
to
obtained
in
this
our
workaday
world
this
allegation
may
sound
strange
but
i
nevertheless
declare
it
to
be
true
the
possession
of
money
may
bring
luxury
and
renown
it
may
enable
men
and
women
to
outshine
their
fellows
it
may
bring
honour
esteem
and
even
popularity
but
what
are
they
all
ask
the
great
landowner
ask
the
wealthy
peer
ask
the
millionaire
if
they
speak
the
truth
they
will
tell
you
in
confidence
that
they
are
not
in
their
hearts
half
so
happy
nor
do
they
enjoy
life
so
much
as
the
small
man
of
independent
means
the
man
who
is
subject
to
an
abatement
upon
his
as
i
sat
there
with
the
dead
man
daughter
endeavouring
to
induce
her
to
receive
the
mysterious
individual
without
open
hostility
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
vivid
contrast
between
the
luxury
of
her
surroundings
and
the
heavy
burden
of
her
heart
she
suggested
that
the
house
should
be
sold
and
that
she
should
retire
to
mayvill
and
there
live
quietly
in
the
country
with
percival
but
i
urged
her
to
wait
at
least
for
the
present
it
seemed
a
pity
that
burton
blair
splendid
collection
of
old
masters
and
the
fine
tapestries
that
he
had
bought
in
spain
only
a
few
years
ago
and
the
unique
collection
of
early
majolica
should
go
to
the
hammer
among
the
many
treasures
in
the
was
andrea
del
sarto
holy
family
for
which
blair
had
given
sixteen
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
at
christie
and
which
was
considered
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
that
great
master
again
the
italian
renaissance
furniture
the
old
montelupo
and
savona
ware
and
the
magnificent
old
english
plate
were
each
worth
a
fortune
in
themselves
and
should
i
contended
remain
mabel
property
as
they
had
been
all
bequeathed
to
her
yes
i
know
she
responded
to
my
argument
everything
is
mine
except
that
little
bag
containing
the
sachet
which
is
yours
and
which
is
so
unfortunately
missing
you
must
help
me
to
recover
it
i
urged
it
will
be
to
our
mutual
interests
to
do
so
of
course
i
will
assist
you
in
every
way
possible
greenwood
was
her
answer
since
you
been
away
in
italy
i
have
had
the
house
searched
from
top
to
bottom
and
have
myself
examined
all
my
his
two
other
safes
and
certain
places
where
he
sometimes
secreted
his
private
papers
in
order
to
discover
whether
fearing
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
to
steal
the
little
bag
he
left
it
at
home
but
all
in
vain
it
certainly
is
not
in
this
house
i
thanked
her
for
her
efforts
knowing
well
that
she
had
acted
vigorously
on
my
behalf
but
feeling
that
any
search
within
that
house
was
futile
and
that
if
the
secret
were
ever
recovered
it
would
be
found
in
the
hands
of
one
or
other
of
blair
s
enemies
together
we
sat
for
a
long
time
discussing
the
situation
the
reason
of
her
hatred
of
the
man
dawson
she
would
not
divulge
but
this
did
not
cause
me
any
real
surprise
for
i
saw
in
her
attitude
a
desire
to
conceal
some
secret
of
her
father
past
nevertheless
after
much
persuasion
i
induced
her
to
consent
to
allow
the
man
to
be
informed
of
his
office
and
to
receive
him
without
betraying
the
slightest
sign
of
annoyance
or
disfavour
this
i
considered
a
triumph
of
my
own
diplomacy
up
to
a
certain
point
i
as
her
best
friend
in
those
hard
dark
days
bygone
possessed
a
complete
influence
over
her
but
beyond
that
when
it
became
a
question
involving
her
father
honour
i
was
entirely
powerless
she
was
a
girl
of
strong
individuality
and
like
all
such
was
quick
of
penetration
and
peculiarly
subject
to
prejudice
on
account
of
her
high
sense
of
honour
she
flattered
me
by
declaring
that
she
wished
that
i
had
been
appointed
her
secretary
whereupon
i
thanked
her
for
the
compliment
but
asserted
such
a
thing
could
never
have
been
why
because
you
have
told
me
that
this
fellow
dawson
is
coming
here
as
a
matter
of
right
your
father
wrote
that
unfortunate
clause
in
his
will
under
compulsion
which
means
because
he
stood
in
fear
of
him
yes
she
sighed
in
a
low
voice
you
are
right
greenwood
quite
right
he
held
my
father
life
in
his
hands
this
latter
remark
struck
me
as
very
strange
could
burton
blair
have
been
guilty
of
some
nameless
crime
that
he
should
fear
this
mysterious
englishman
perhaps
so
perhaps
the
man
dick
dawson
who
had
for
years
been
passing
as
an
italian
in
rural
italy
was
the
only
living
witness
of
an
incident
which
blair
in
his
prosperous
days
would
have
gladly
given
a
million
to
efface
such
indeed
was
one
of
the
many
theories
which
arose
within
me
yet
when
i
recollected
the
bluff
honesty
of
burton
blair
his
sterling
sincerity
his
and
his
anonymous
charitable
works
for
charity
sake
i
crushed
down
all
such
suspicions
and
determined
only
to
respect
the
dead
man
memory
the
next
night
just
before
nine
as
reggie
and
i
were
chatting
over
our
coffee
in
our
cosy
little
in
great
russell
street
glave
our
man
tapped
entered
and
handed
me
a
card
i
sprang
from
my
chair
as
though
i
had
received
an
electric
shock
well
this
is
funny
old
chap
i
cried
turning
to
my
friend
actually
the
man
dawson
himself
dawson
gasped
the
man
against
whom
the
monk
had
warned
me
have
him
in
but
by
gad
we
must
be
careful
of
what
we
say
for
if
all
is
true
of
him
he
has
the
cuteness
of
old
nick
himself
leave
him
to
me
i
said
then
turning
to
glave
said
show
the
gentleman
in
and
we
both
waited
in
breathless
expectancy
for
the
appearance
of
the
man
who
knew
the
truth
concerning
the
past
of
burton
blair
and
who
for
some
mysterious
reason
had
concealed
himself
so
long
in
the
guise
of
an
italian
a
moment
later
he
was
ushered
in
and
bowing
to
us
exclaimed
with
a
smile
i
suppose
gentlemen
i
have
to
introduce
myself
my
name
is
dawson
richard
dawson
and
mine
is
gilbert
greenwood
i
said
rather
distantly
while
my
friend
here
is
reginald
seton
i
have
heard
of
you
both
from
our
mutual
friend
now
unfortunately
deceased
burton
blair
he
exclaimed
and
sank
slowly
into
the
grandfather
armchair
which
i
indicated
while
i
myself
stood
upon
the
hearthrug
with
my
back
to
the
fire
in
order
to
take
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
in
evening
clothes
over
which
he
wore
a
black
overcoat
yet
there
was
nothing
about
him
suggestive
of
the
man
of
strong
character
he
was
of
middle
height
and
his
age
i
judged
to
be
nearly
fifty
he
wore
round
with
thick
pebbles
through
which
he
seemed
to
blink
at
us
like
a
german
professor
and
his
general
aspect
was
that
of
a
sedate
and
studious
man
beneath
a
patchy
mass
of
hair
his
forehead
fell
in
wrinkled
notches
over
a
pair
of
sunken
blue
eyes
one
of
which
looked
upon
the
world
in
speculative
wonder
while
the
other
was
grey
cloudy
and
sightless
straggling
eyebrows
wandered
in
a
curiously
uncertain
manner
to
their
above
a
somewhat
fleshy
nose
below
the
cheeks
and
beard
and
moustache
blended
in
a
of
grey
from
the
sleeves
of
his
overcoat
as
he
sat
there
before
us
his
lithe
brown
fingers
shot
in
and
out
twisting
and
tapping
the
padded
arms
of
the
chair
with
nervous
persistence
and
in
a
manner
which
indicated
the
high
tension
of
the
man
my
reason
for
intruding
upon
you
at
this
hour
he
said
half
apologetically
yet
with
a
mysterious
smile
upon
his
thick
lips
is
because
i
only
arrived
back
in
london
this
evening
and
discovered
that
my
friend
blair
has
by
his
will
left
in
my
hands
the
control
of
his
daughter
affairs
oh
i
exclaimed
in
pretended
surprise
as
though
it
were
news
to
me
and
who
has
said
this
i
have
received
information
privately
was
his
evasive
answer
but
before
proceeding
further
i
thought
it
best
to
call
upon
you
in
order
that
we
might
from
the
outset
thoroughly
understand
each
other
i
know
that
both
of
you
have
been
blair
most
intimate
and
kindest
friends
while
owing
to
certain
somewhat
curious
circumstances
i
have
been
compelled
until
to
remain
entirely
in
the
background
his
friend
in
secret
as
it
were
i
am
also
well
aware
of
the
circumstances
in
which
you
met
of
your
charity
to
my
dead
friend
and
to
his
daughter
in
fact
he
told
me
everything
for
he
had
no
secrets
from
me
yet
you
on
your
part
he
continued
glancing
at
us
from
one
to
the
other
with
that
single
blue
eye
you
must
have
regarded
his
sudden
wealth
as
a
complete
mystery
we
certainly
have
done
i
remarked
ah
he
exclaimed
quickly
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
then
he
has
revealed
to
you
nothing
and
in
an
instant
i
saw
that
i
had
inadvertently
told
the
fellow
exactly
what
he
most
desired
to
know
chapter
thirteen
burton
blair
secret
is
revealed
whatever
burton
blair
told
me
was
in
strictest
confidence
i
exclaimed
resenting
the
fellow
intrusion
yet
secretly
glad
to
have
that
opportunity
of
meeting
him
and
of
endeavouring
to
ascertain
his
intentions
of
course
answered
dawson
with
a
smile
his
one
shining
eye
blinking
at
me
from
behind
his
glasses
but
his
friendliness
and
gratitude
never
led
him
sufficiently
far
to
reveal
to
you
his
secret
no
i
think
if
you
will
pardon
me
greenwood
it
is
useless
for
us
to
fence
in
this
manner
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
i
know
rather
more
of
burton
blair
and
his
past
life
than
you
ever
have
done
admitted
i
said
blair
was
always
very
reticent
he
set
himself
to
solve
some
mystery
and
achieved
his
object
and
by
doing
so
gained
over
two
millions
sterling
which
people
still
regard
as
a
mystery
there
is
however
no
mystery
about
those
heaps
of
securities
lying
at
his
banks
nor
about
the
cash
with
which
he
purchased
them
he
laughed
it
was
good
bank
of
england
notes
and
solid
gold
coin
of
the
realm
but
now
he
dead
poor
fellow
it
has
all
come
to
an
end
he
added
with
a
slightly
reflective
air
but
his
secret
still
exists
reggie
remarked
he
has
bequeathed
it
to
my
friend
here
what
snapped
the
man
with
one
eye
turning
to
me
in
sheer
amazement
he
has
left
his
secret
with
you
he
seemed
utterly
staggered
by
reggie
words
and
i
noted
the
evil
glitter
in
his
glance
he
has
the
secret
is
now
mine
i
answered
although
i
did
not
tell
him
that
the
mysterious
little
wash
leather
bag
was
missing
but
do
you
know
what
that
involves
man
he
cried
and
having
risen
from
his
chair
he
now
stood
before
me
his
thin
fingers
twitching
with
excitement
no
i
do
i
said
laughing
in
an
endeavour
to
treat
his
words
lightly
he
has
left
me
as
a
legacy
the
little
bag
he
always
carried
together
with
certain
instructions
which
i
shall
endeavour
to
act
upon
very
well
he
snarled
do
just
as
you
think
fit
only
i
would
rather
you
were
left
possessor
of
that
secret
than
me
that
all
his
dismay
and
annoyance
apparently
knew
no
bounds
he
strove
hard
to
conceal
it
but
without
avail
it
was
therefore
at
once
plain
that
there
was
some
very
strong
motive
why
the
secret
should
not
be
allowed
to
fall
into
my
possession
yet
his
belief
that
the
little
sachet
had
already
passed
into
my
hands
negatived
my
theory
that
this
mysterious
person
was
in
any
way
connected
with
burton
blair
death
believe
me
dawson
i
said
quite
calmly
i
entertain
no
fear
of
the
result
of
my
friend
kind
generosity
indeed
i
can
see
no
ground
for
any
apprehension
blair
discovered
a
mystery
which
by
dint
of
long
patience
and
almost
superhuman
effort
he
succeeded
in
solving
and
i
presume
that
possibly
from
a
feeling
of
some
little
gratitude
for
the
small
help
my
friend
and
myself
were
able
to
render
him
he
has
left
his
secret
in
my
keeping
the
man
was
silent
for
several
moments
with
that
single
irritating
eye
fixed
upon
me
immovably
ah
he
exclaimed
at
last
with
impatience
i
see
that
you
are
in
utter
ignorance
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
you
should
remain
so
then
he
added
but
let
us
talk
of
another
matter
of
the
future
well
i
inquired
and
what
of
the
future
i
am
appointed
secretary
to
mabel
blair
and
the
controller
of
her
affairs
and
i
promised
burton
blair
upon
his
deathbed
to
guard
and
protect
the
young
lady
interests
i
said
in
a
cold
calm
voice
then
may
i
ask
now
we
are
upon
the
subject
whether
you
entertain
matrimonial
intentions
towards
her
no
you
shall
not
ask
me
anything
of
the
kind
i
blazed
forth
your
question
is
a
piece
of
outrageous
impertinence
sir
come
come
gilbert
reggie
exclaimed
there
surely
no
need
to
quarrel
none
whatever
declared
richard
dawson
with
a
supercilious
air
the
question
is
quite
simple
and
one
which
i
as
the
future
controller
of
the
young
lady
fortune
have
a
perfect
right
to
ask
i
understand
he
added
that
she
has
grown
to
be
very
attractive
and
popular
your
question
is
one
which
i
refuse
to
answer
i
declared
with
considerable
warmth
i
might
just
as
well
demand
of
you
the
reason
why
you
have
been
lying
low
in
italy
all
these
years
or
why
you
received
letters
addressed
to
a
back
street
in
florence
his
jaw
dropped
his
brows
slightly
contracted
and
i
saw
my
remark
caused
him
some
apprehension
oh
and
how
are
you
aware
that
i
have
lived
in
italy
but
in
order
to
mislead
him
i
smiled
mysteriously
and
replied
the
man
who
holds
burton
blair
secret
also
holds
certain
secrets
concerning
his
friends
then
i
added
meaningly
the
ceco
is
well
known
in
florence
and
in
lucca
his
face
blanched
his
thin
sinewy
fingers
moved
again
and
the
twitching
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
showed
how
intensely
excited
he
had
become
at
that
mention
of
his
nickname
ah
he
exclaimed
he
has
played
me
false
then
after
all
he
has
told
you
that
eh
very
well
and
he
laughed
the
strange
hollow
laugh
of
a
man
who
contemplates
revenge
very
well
gentlemen
i
see
my
position
in
this
affair
is
that
of
an
intruder
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
it
is
exclaimed
reggie
you
were
unknown
until
the
dead
man
will
was
read
and
i
do
not
anticipate
that
the
young
lady
will
care
to
be
compelled
to
employ
a
stranger
a
stranger
he
laughed
with
a
haughty
touch
of
sarcasm
dick
dawson
a
stranger
no
sir
you
will
find
that
to
her
i
am
no
stranger
on
the
other
hand
you
will
i
think
discover
that
instead
of
resenting
my
interference
the
young
lady
will
rather
welcome
it
wait
and
see
he
added
with
a
strangely
confident
air
i
intend
to
call
upon
leighton
and
to
take
up
my
duties
as
secretary
to
the
daughter
of
the
late
burton
blair
millionaire
and
laying
stress
on
the
final
word
he
laughed
again
defiantly
in
our
faces
he
was
not
a
gentleman
i
decided
that
on
the
instant
he
had
entered
the
room
outwardly
his
bearing
was
that
of
one
who
had
mixed
with
respectable
people
but
it
was
only
a
veneer
of
polish
for
when
he
grew
excited
he
was
just
as
uncouth
as
the
bluff
seafarer
who
had
so
suddenly
expired
his
twang
was
pronouncedly
cockney
even
though
it
was
said
he
had
lived
in
italy
so
many
years
that
he
had
almost
become
an
italian
a
man
who
is
a
real
born
londoner
can
never
disguise
his
nasal
n
even
though
he
live
his
life
at
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
we
had
both
quickly
detected
that
the
stranger
though
of
rather
slim
built
was
unusually
muscular
and
this
was
the
man
who
had
had
those
frequent
secret
interviews
with
the
capuchin
fra
antonio
that
he
stood
in
no
fear
of
us
had
been
shown
by
the
bold
and
open
manner
in
which
he
had
called
and
the
frankness
with
which
he
had
spoken
he
was
entirely
confident
in
his
own
position
and
was
inwardly
chuckling
at
our
own
ignorance
you
speak
of
me
as
a
stranger
gentlemen
he
said
buttoning
his
overcoat
after
a
short
pause
and
taking
up
his
stick
i
suppose
i
am
but
i
shall
not
be
so
very
soon
i
hope
we
shall
learn
to
know
one
another
better
then
perhaps
you
will
trust
me
a
little
further
than
you
do
this
evening
recollect
that
i
have
for
many
years
been
the
dead
man
most
intimate
friend
it
was
on
the
point
of
my
tongue
to
remark
that
the
reason
of
the
strange
clause
in
the
will
was
because
of
poor
burton
fear
of
him
and
that
it
had
been
inserted
under
compulsion
but
i
fortunately
managed
to
restrain
myself
and
to
wish
the
fellow
with
some
show
of
politeness
well
i
hanged
gilbert
cried
reggie
when
the
man
had
gone
the
situation
grows
more
interesting
and
complicated
every
moment
leighton
has
a
tough
customer
to
deal
with
that
very
evident
yes
i
sighed
he
has
the
best
of
us
all
round
because
blair
evidently
took
him
completely
into
his
confidence
burton
treated
us
shabbily
that
my
opinion
greenwood
blurted
forth
my
friend
selecting
a
fresh
cigar
and
biting
off
the
end
viciously
he
left
his
secret
to
me
remember
he
may
have
destroyed
it
after
making
the
will
my
friend
suggested
no
it
is
either
hidden
or
has
been
stolen
which
is
not
at
all
plain
for
my
own
part
i
consider
that
the
theory
of
murder
is
gradually
becoming
dispelled
if
he
had
any
suspicion
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
he
surely
would
have
made
some
remark
to
us
before
he
died
of
that
i
feel
absolutely
convinced
very
probably
he
remarked
rather
dubiously
however
but
what
we
have
now
to
discover
is
whether
that
little
bag
he
wore
is
still
in
existence
the
man
dawson
was
evidently
in
england
before
poor
blair
death
it
may
have
passed
into
his
possession
i
suggested
he
would
in
all
probability
endeavour
to
get
hold
of
it
reggie
agreed
we
must
establish
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
on
that
day
when
blair
was
so
mysteriously
seized
in
the
train
i
do
like
the
fellow
apart
from
his
alias
and
the
secrecy
of
friendship
with
blair
he
means
mischief
old
chap
distinct
mischief
i
saw
it
in
that
one
eye
of
his
remember
what
he
said
about
blair
giving
him
away
it
struck
me
that
he
contemplates
revenge
upon
poor
mabel
he
better
not
try
to
injure
her
i
exclaimed
fiercely
i
my
promise
to
keep
to
poor
burton
and
i
keep
it
by
heaven
i
will
to
the
very
letter
she
fall
into
the
hands
of
that
adventurer
i
take
good
care
she
in
fear
of
him
already
i
wonder
why
unfortunately
she
wo
tell
me
he
probably
holds
some
guilty
secret
of
the
dead
man
the
truth
of
which
if
exposed
might
for
all
we
know
have
the
effect
of
placing
mabel
herself
outside
the
pale
of
good
society
seton
grunted
lolled
back
in
his
chair
and
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
by
jove
he
exclaimed
after
a
brief
silence
i
wonder
whether
that
is
so
on
the
following
morning
as
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
a
note
from
mabel
was
brought
by
a
asking
me
to
come
round
to
grosvenor
square
at
once
therefore
without
delay
i
swallowed
my
coffee
struggled
into
my
overcoat
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
entered
the
bright
where
the
dead
man
daughter
her
face
rather
flushed
by
excitement
stood
awaiting
me
what
the
matter
i
inquired
quickly
as
i
took
her
hand
fearing
that
the
man
she
loathed
had
already
called
upon
her
nothing
serious
she
laughed
i
have
only
a
piece
of
very
good
news
for
you
for
me
what
without
answering
she
placed
on
the
table
a
small
plain
silver
upon
one
corner
of
the
lid
of
which
was
engraved
the
cipher
double
b
that
monogram
that
was
upon
all
blair
plate
carriages
harness
and
other
possessions
see
what
is
inside
that
she
exclaimed
pointing
to
the
box
before
her
and
smiling
sweetly
with
profound
satisfaction
i
eagerly
took
it
in
my
hands
and
raising
the
lid
peered
within
what
i
cried
aloud
almost
beside
myself
with
joy
it
ca
really
be
yes
she
laughed
it
is
and
then
with
trembling
fingers
i
drew
forth
from
the
box
the
actual
object
that
had
been
bequeathed
to
me
the
little
bag
of
chamois
leather
the
small
sachet
about
the
size
of
a
man
palm
attached
to
which
was
a
thin
but
very
strong
golden
chain
for
suspending
it
around
the
neck
i
found
it
this
morning
quite
accidentally
just
as
it
is
in
a
secret
drawer
in
the
old
bureau
in
my
father
she
explained
he
must
have
placed
it
there
for
security
before
leaving
for
scotland
i
held
it
in
my
hand
utterly
stupefied
yet
with
the
most
profound
gratification
did
not
the
very
fact
that
blair
had
taken
it
off
and
placed
it
in
that
box
rather
than
risk
wearing
it
during
that
journey
to
the
north
prove
that
he
had
gone
in
fear
of
an
attempt
being
made
to
obtain
its
possession
nevertheless
the
curious
little
object
bequeathed
to
me
under
such
strange
conditions
was
now
actually
in
my
hand
a
flat
bag
of
that
was
black
with
age
and
wear
about
thick
and
containing
something
flat
and
hard
within
was
concealed
the
great
secret
the
knowledge
of
which
had
raised
burton
blair
from
a
homeless
seafarer
into
affluence
what
it
could
be
neither
mabel
nor
i
could
for
a
moment
imagine
both
of
us
were
breathless
equally
eager
to
ascertain
the
truth
surely
never
in
the
life
of
any
man
was
there
presented
a
more
interesting
or
a
more
tantalising
problem
in
silence
she
took
up
a
pair
of
small
buttonhole
scissors
from
the
little
in
the
window
and
handed
them
to
me
then
my
hand
trembling
with
excitement
i
inserted
the
point
into
the
end
of
the
leather
packet
and
made
a
long
sharp
cut
the
whole
of
its
length
but
what
fell
out
upon
the
carpet
next
instant
caused
us
both
to
utter
loud
exclamations
of
surprise
burton
blair
most
treasured
possession
the
great
secret
which
he
had
carried
on
his
person
all
those
years
and
through
all
those
wanderings
now
at
last
revealed
proved
utterly
astounding
chapter
fourteen
gives
an
expert
opinion
upon
the
carpet
at
our
feet
lay
scattered
a
pack
of
very
small
rather
dirty
cards
which
had
fallen
from
the
little
sachet
and
which
both
of
us
stood
regarding
with
surprise
and
disappointment
for
my
own
part
i
expected
to
find
within
that
treasured
bag
of
something
of
more
value
than
those
thumbed
and
half
pieces
of
pasteboard
but
our
curiosity
was
instantly
aroused
when
on
stooping
i
picked
up
one
of
them
and
discovered
certain
letters
written
in
brown
faded
ink
upon
it
similar
to
those
upon
the
card
already
in
my
possession
it
chanced
to
be
the
ten
of
diamonds
and
in
order
that
you
may
be
able
to
the
more
clearly
understand
the
arrangement
of
the
letters
upon
them
i
reproduce
it
here
how
strange
cried
mabel
taking
the
card
and
examining
it
closely
it
surely
must
be
some
cipher
the
same
as
the
other
card
which
i
found
sealed
up
in
the
safe
no
doubt
i
exclaimed
as
stooping
and
gathering
up
the
remainder
of
the
pack
i
noticed
that
upon
each
of
them
either
upon
the
front
or
upon
the
back
were
scrawled
either
fourteen
or
fifteen
letters
in
a
treble
column
all
of
course
utterly
unintelligible
i
counted
them
it
was
a
piquet
pack
of
the
missing
card
being
the
ace
of
hearts
which
we
had
already
discovered
by
the
friction
of
having
been
carried
on
the
person
for
so
long
the
corners
and
edges
were
worn
while
the
gloss
of
the
surface
had
long
ago
disappeared
aided
by
mabel
i
spread
them
all
upon
the
table
utterly
bewildered
by
the
columns
of
letters
which
showed
that
some
deep
secret
was
written
upon
them
yet
what
it
was
we
were
utterly
unable
to
decipher
upon
the
front
of
the
ace
of
clubs
was
scrawled
in
three
parallel
columns
of
five
letters
each
thus
e
h
n
w
e
d
t
o
l
i
e
h
w
h
r
again
i
turned
up
the
king
of
spades
and
found
on
the
reverse
only
fourteen
letters
q
w
f
t
s
w
t
h
u
o
f
e
y
e
i
wonder
what
it
all
means
i
exclaimed
carefully
examining
the
written
characters
in
the
light
the
letters
were
in
capitals
just
as
rudely
and
unevenly
drawn
as
those
upon
the
ace
of
hearts
evidently
by
an
uneducated
hand
indeed
the
a
betrayed
a
foreign
form
rather
than
english
and
the
fact
that
some
of
the
cards
were
inscribed
on
the
obverse
and
others
on
the
reverse
seemed
to
convey
some
hidden
meaning
what
it
was
however
was
both
tantalising
and
puzzling
it
certainly
is
very
curious
mabel
remarked
after
she
had
vainly
striven
to
construct
intelligible
words
from
the
columns
of
letters
by
the
easy
methods
of
calculation
i
had
no
idea
that
my
father
carried
his
secret
concealed
in
this
manner
yes
i
said
it
really
is
amazing
no
doubt
his
secret
is
really
written
here
if
we
only
knew
the
key
but
in
all
probability
his
enemies
are
aware
of
its
existence
or
he
would
not
have
left
it
secreted
here
when
he
set
forth
on
his
journey
to
manchester
that
man
dawson
may
know
it
most
probably
was
her
reply
he
was
my
father
intimate
acquaintance
his
friend
he
says
he
was
friend
she
cried
resentfully
no
his
enemy
and
therefore
your
father
held
him
in
fear
it
was
that
reason
which
induced
him
to
insert
that
very
injudicious
clause
in
his
will
and
then
i
described
to
her
the
visit
of
the
man
dawson
on
the
previous
night
telling
her
what
he
had
said
and
his
impudent
defiant
attitude
towards
us
she
sighed
but
uttered
no
reply
i
noticed
that
as
i
spoke
her
countenance
went
a
trifle
paler
but
she
remained
silent
as
though
she
feared
to
speak
lest
she
should
inadvertently
expose
what
she
intended
should
remain
a
secret
my
chief
thought
at
that
moment
however
was
the
elucidation
of
the
problem
presented
by
those
cards
the
secret
of
burton
blair
the
knowledge
of
which
had
brought
him
his
millions
was
hidden
there
and
as
it
had
been
bequeathed
to
me
it
was
surely
to
my
interest
to
exert
every
effort
to
gain
exact
knowledge
of
it
i
recollected
how
very
careful
he
had
been
over
that
little
bag
which
now
lay
empty
upon
the
table
and
with
what
careless
confidence
he
had
shown
it
to
me
on
that
night
when
he
was
but
a
homeless
wanderer
tramping
the
muddy
turnpike
roads
as
he
had
held
it
in
his
hand
his
eyes
had
brightened
with
keen
anticipation
he
would
be
a
rich
man
some
day
he
had
prophesied
and
i
in
my
ignorance
had
then
believed
him
to
be
romancing
but
when
i
looked
around
that
room
in
which
i
now
stood
and
saw
that
murillo
and
that
tintoretto
each
of
them
worth
a
small
fortune
in
themselves
i
was
bound
to
confess
that
i
had
wrongly
mistrusted
him
and
the
secret
written
upon
that
little
pack
of
cards
was
mine
if
only
i
could
decipher
it
surely
no
situation
could
be
more
tantalising
to
a
poor
man
like
myself
the
man
whom
i
had
been
able
to
befriend
had
left
me
in
gracious
recognition
the
secret
of
the
source
of
his
enormous
income
yet
so
well
concealed
was
it
that
neither
mabel
nor
myself
could
decipher
it
what
shall
you
do
she
inquired
presently
after
poring
over
the
cards
in
silence
for
quite
ten
minutes
is
there
no
expert
in
london
who
might
find
out
the
key
surely
those
people
who
do
cryptograms
and
things
could
help
us
certainly
was
my
answer
but
in
that
case
if
they
were
successful
they
would
discover
the
secret
for
themselves
ah
i
never
thought
of
that
your
father
directions
in
his
will
as
to
secrecy
are
very
explicit
but
possession
of
these
cards
without
the
key
is
surely
not
of
much
benefit
she
argued
could
you
not
consult
somebody
and
ascertain
by
what
means
such
records
are
deciphered
i
might
make
inquiries
in
a
general
way
i
answered
but
to
place
the
pack
of
cards
blindly
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
would
i
fear
simply
be
giving
away
your
father
most
confidential
possession
there
may
be
written
here
some
fact
which
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
world
shall
know
ah
she
said
glancing
quickly
up
at
me
some
facts
regarding
his
past
you
mean
yes
you
are
quite
right
greenwood
we
must
be
very
careful
to
guard
the
secret
of
these
cards
well
especially
if
as
you
suggest
the
man
dawson
really
knows
the
means
by
which
the
record
may
be
rendered
intelligible
the
secret
has
been
bequeathed
to
me
therefore
i
will
take
possession
of
them
i
said
i
will
also
make
inquiries
and
ascertain
by
what
means
such
ciphers
are
rendered
into
plain
english
i
had
at
that
moment
thought
of
a
man
named
boyle
a
professor
at
a
in
leicester
who
was
an
expert
at
anagrams
ciphers
and
such
things
and
i
intended
to
lose
no
time
in
running
up
there
to
see
him
and
ascertain
his
opinion
therefore
at
noon
i
took
train
at
pancras
and
about
two
was
sitting
with
him
in
his
private
room
at
the
college
he
was
a
man
of
quick
intelligence
who
had
frequently
won
prizes
in
various
competitions
offered
by
different
journals
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
committed
bartlett
of
familiar
to
memory
and
whose
ingenuity
in
deciphering
puzzles
was
unequalled
while
smoking
a
cigarette
with
him
i
explained
the
point
upon
which
i
desired
his
opinion
may
i
see
the
cards
he
inquired
removing
his
briar
from
his
mouth
and
looking
at
me
with
some
surprise
i
thought
my
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
him
sight
of
them
but
on
second
thoughts
i
recollected
that
of
all
men
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
experts
in
such
matters
therefore
i
drew
the
little
pack
from
the
envelope
in
which
i
had
placed
them
ah
he
exclaimed
the
moment
he
took
them
in
his
hand
and
ran
quickly
through
them
this
greenwood
is
the
most
complicated
and
most
difficult
of
all
ciphers
it
was
in
vogue
in
italy
and
spain
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
afterwards
in
england
but
seems
to
have
dropped
into
disuse
during
the
past
hundred
years
or
so
probably
on
account
of
its
great
difficulty
carefully
he
spread
the
cards
out
in
suits
upon
the
table
and
seemed
to
make
long
and
elaborate
calculations
between
the
heavy
puffs
at
his
pipe
no
he
exclaimed
it
is
what
i
expected
will
never
help
you
in
this
solution
you
might
try
for
a
hundred
years
to
decipher
it
but
will
fail
if
you
do
not
discover
the
key
indeed
so
much
ingenuity
is
shown
in
it
that
a
writer
in
the
last
century
estimated
that
in
such
a
pack
of
cards
as
this
with
such
a
cipher
upon
them
there
are
at
least
fully
millions
of
possible
arrangements
but
how
is
the
cipher
written
i
inquired
much
interested
yet
with
at
his
inability
to
assist
me
it
is
done
in
this
way
he
said
the
writer
of
the
secret
settles
what
he
wishes
to
record
and
he
then
arranges
the
cards
in
what
order
he
wishes
he
then
writes
the
first
letters
of
his
message
record
or
whatever
it
may
be
on
the
face
or
on
the
back
of
the
cards
one
letter
upon
each
card
consecutively
commencing
with
the
first
column
and
going
on
with
columns
two
and
three
working
down
each
column
until
he
has
written
the
last
letter
of
the
cipher
in
the
writing
however
certain
prearranged
letters
are
used
in
place
of
spaces
and
sometimes
the
cipher
is
made
still
more
difficult
or
a
chance
finder
of
the
cards
to
decipher
by
the
introduction
of
a
specially
arranged
shuffle
of
the
cards
half
way
through
the
writing
of
the
record
very
ingenious
i
remarked
utterly
bewildered
by
the
extraordinary
complication
of
burton
blair
secret
and
yet
the
letters
are
so
plainly
written
that
just
it
he
laughed
to
the
eye
it
is
the
plainest
of
all
ciphers
and
yet
one
that
is
utterly
unintelligible
unless
the
exact
formula
in
its
writing
be
known
when
that
is
ascertained
the
solution
becomes
easy
the
cards
are
rearranged
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
written
upon
and
the
record
or
message
spelt
off
one
letter
on
each
card
in
succession
reading
down
one
column
after
another
and
omitting
the
letter
arranged
as
spaces
ah
i
exclaimed
fervently
how
i
wish
i
knew
the
key
is
this
a
very
important
secret
then
asked
boyle
very
i
replied
a
confidential
matter
which
has
been
placed
in
my
hands
and
one
which
i
am
bound
to
solve
i
fear
you
will
never
do
so
unless
the
key
is
in
existence
was
his
answer
it
is
far
too
difficult
for
me
to
attempt
the
complications
which
are
so
simply
effected
in
the
writing
shield
it
effectually
from
any
chance
solution
therefore
all
endeavours
to
decipher
it
without
knowledge
of
the
of
the
pack
must
necessarily
prove
futile
he
replaced
the
cards
in
the
envelope
and
handed
them
back
to
me
regretting
that
he
could
not
render
me
assistance
you
might
try
every
day
for
years
and
years
he
declared
and
you
would
be
no
nearer
the
truth
it
is
too
well
protected
for
chance
discovery
and
is
indeed
the
safest
and
most
ingenious
cipher
ever
devised
by
man
ingenuity
i
remained
and
took
a
cup
of
tea
with
him
then
at
four
entered
the
express
and
returned
to
london
disappointed
at
my
utterly
fruitless
errand
what
he
had
explained
to
me
rendered
the
secret
more
impenetrable
and
inscrutable
than
ever
chapter
fifteen
certain
things
we
found
at
mayvill
miss
blair
sir
announced
glave
next
day
just
before
noon
while
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
room
in
great
russell
street
smoking
vigorously
and
utterly
bewildered
over
the
problem
of
the
dead
pack
of
cards
i
sprang
to
my
feet
to
welcome
mabel
who
in
her
rich
warm
furs
was
looking
very
dainty
and
charming
i
suppose
if
percival
knew
i
had
come
here
alone
she
give
me
a
sound
lecture
against
visiting
a
man
rooms
she
said
laughing
after
i
had
greeted
her
and
closed
the
door
well
i
said
it
scarcely
the
first
time
you
honoured
me
with
a
visit
is
it
and
surely
you
need
not
trouble
very
much
about
mrs
percival
oh
she
really
grows
more
every
day
mabel
pouted
i
must
go
here
and
i
must
go
there
and
she
afraid
of
me
speaking
with
this
man
and
the
other
man
is
not
to
be
known
and
so
on
really
growing
rather
sick
of
it
i
can
tell
you
she
declared
seating
herself
in
the
chair
i
had
just
vacated
unloosing
her
heavy
sable
cape
and
stretching
a
neat
ankle
to
the
fire
but
she
been
an
awfully
good
friend
to
you
i
argued
as
far
as
i
can
see
she
been
the
most
of
chaperons
the
perfect
chaperon
is
the
one
who
can
utterly
and
effectually
efface
herself
five
minutes
after
entering
the
room
mabel
declared
and
i
will
give
percival
her
due
she
never
clung
on
to
me
at
dances
and
if
she
found
me
sitting
out
in
a
dim
corner
she
has
always
made
it
a
point
to
have
an
urgent
call
in
an
opposite
direction
yes
she
sighed
i
suppose
i
ought
to
grumble
when
i
recollect
the
snappy
old
tabbies
in
whose
hands
some
girls
are
there
lady
anetta
gordon
for
instance
and
vi
drummond
both
pretty
girls
out
last
season
but
whose
lives
are
rendered
perfect
tortures
by
those
two
ugly
old
hags
who
cart
them
about
why
they
both
told
me
they
dare
not
raise
their
eyes
to
a
man
without
a
snappy
lecture
next
day
on
polite
manners
and
maiden
modesty
well
i
said
frankly
standing
on
the
hearthrug
and
looking
down
at
her
handsome
figure
i
really
do
think
you
have
had
much
to
complain
about
up
to
the
present
your
poor
father
was
most
indulgent
and
sure
percival
although
she
may
seem
rather
harsh
at
times
is
only
speaking
for
your
own
benefit
oh
i
know
i
a
very
wilful
girl
in
your
eyes
she
exclaimed
with
a
smile
you
always
used
to
say
so
when
i
was
at
school
well
to
tell
the
truth
you
were
i
answered
quite
openly
of
course
you
men
never
make
allowance
for
a
girl
you
assume
your
freedom
with
your
first
long
trousers
while
we
unfortunate
girls
are
not
allowed
a
single
moment
alone
either
inside
the
house
or
out
of
it
no
matter
whether
we
be
as
ugly
as
mother
shipton
or
as
beautiful
as
venus
we
must
all
of
us
be
tied
up
to
some
elder
woman
who
very
often
is
just
as
fond
of
a
mild
flirtation
as
the
simpering
young
miss
in
her
charge
forgive
me
for
speaking
so
candidly
wo
you
greenwood
but
my
opinion
is
that
the
modern
methods
of
society
are
all
sham
and
humbug
you
not
in
a
very
polite
mood
it
seems
i
remarked
being
unable
to
restrain
a
smile
no
i
not
she
admitted
percival
is
so
very
aggravating
i
want
to
go
down
to
mayvill
this
afternoon
and
she
wo
let
me
go
alone
why
do
you
so
particularly
wish
to
go
there
alone
she
flushed
slightly
and
appeared
for
a
moment
to
be
confused
oh
well
i
do
want
to
go
alone
very
particularly
you
know
she
tried
to
assure
me
it
is
the
foolishness
of
not
allowing
me
to
travel
down
there
like
any
other
girl
that
i
object
to
if
a
maid
can
take
a
railway
journey
alone
why
ca
i
because
you
have
the
of
society
to
respect
the
domestic
servant
need
not
then
i
prefer
the
lot
of
the
domestic
she
declared
in
a
manner
which
told
me
that
something
had
annoyed
her
for
my
own
part
i
should
have
regretted
very
much
if
percival
had
consented
to
her
going
down
to
herefordshire
alone
while
it
also
seemed
apparent
that
she
had
some
secret
reason
of
her
own
for
not
taking
her
elder
companion
with
her
what
i
wondered
could
it
be
i
inquired
the
reason
why
she
wished
to
go
to
mayvill
without
even
a
maid
but
she
made
an
excuse
that
she
wanted
to
see
the
other
four
hunters
were
being
properly
treated
by
the
and
also
to
make
a
search
through
her
father
study
to
ascertain
whether
any
important
or
confidential
papers
remained
there
she
had
the
keys
and
intended
to
do
this
before
that
odious
person
dawson
assumed
his
office
this
suggestion
evidently
made
as
an
excuse
struck
me
as
one
that
really
should
be
acted
upon
without
delay
yet
it
was
so
very
plain
that
she
desired
to
go
alone
that
at
first
i
hesitated
to
offer
to
accompany
her
our
friendship
was
of
such
a
close
and
intimate
character
that
i
could
of
course
offer
to
do
so
without
overstepping
the
bounds
of
propriety
nevertheless
i
resolved
to
first
endeavour
to
learn
the
reason
of
her
strong
desire
to
travel
alone
she
was
a
clever
woman
however
and
had
no
intention
of
telling
me
she
had
a
strong
and
secret
desire
to
go
down
alone
to
that
fine
old
country
house
that
was
now
her
own
and
did
not
desire
that
percival
should
accompany
her
if
you
are
really
going
to
search
the
library
mabel
had
i
not
better
accompany
and
help
you
i
suggested
presently
that
is
of
course
if
you
will
permit
me
i
added
apologetically
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
as
though
devising
some
means
out
of
a
dilemma
then
she
answered
if
you
come
i
of
course
be
only
too
delighted
indeed
you
really
ought
to
assist
me
for
we
might
discover
some
key
to
the
cipher
on
the
cards
my
father
was
down
there
for
three
days
about
a
fortnight
before
his
death
when
shall
we
start
at
from
paddington
will
that
suit
you
you
shall
come
and
be
my
guest
and
she
laughed
mischievously
at
such
utter
of
the
and
the
probable
chagrin
of
the
percival
very
well
i
agreed
and
ten
minutes
later
i
went
down
with
her
and
put
her
smiling
sweetly
into
her
smart
victoria
the
servants
of
which
were
now
in
mourning
you
perceive
that
i
was
playing
a
very
dangerous
game
and
so
i
was
as
you
will
afterwards
see
at
the
hour
appointed
i
met
her
at
paddington
and
putting
aside
her
sad
thoughtfulness
at
her
bereavement
we
travelled
together
down
to
dunmore
station
beyond
hereford
here
we
entered
the
brougham
awaiting
us
and
after
a
drive
of
nearly
three
miles
descended
before
the
splendid
old
mansion
which
burton
blair
had
bought
two
years
before
for
the
sake
of
the
shooting
and
fishing
surrounding
it
standing
in
its
fine
park
between
king
pyon
and
dilwyn
mayvill
court
was
and
is
still
one
of
the
show
places
of
the
county
it
was
an
ideal
ancestral
hall
the
grand
old
gabled
house
with
its
lofty
square
towers
its
jacobean
entrance
gateway
and
dovecote
and
the
fantastically
clipped
and
of
its
quaint
garden
possessed
a
delightful
charm
which
few
other
ancient
mansions
could
boast
and
a
still
further
interesting
feature
lay
in
its
perfectly
unaltered
state
throughout
even
to
the
minutest
detail
for
close
on
three
hundred
years
it
had
been
held
by
its
original
owners
the
baddesleys
until
blair
had
purchased
it
furniture
pictures
armour
everything
just
as
it
stood
it
was
nearly
nine
when
gibbons
the
elderly
housekeeper
welcomed
us
in
tears
at
the
death
of
her
master
and
we
passed
into
the
great
hall
in
which
hung
the
sword
and
portrait
of
the
gallant
cavalier
captain
harry
baddesley
of
whom
there
still
was
told
a
romantic
story
narrowly
escaping
from
the
the
captain
spurred
homewards
with
some
of
cromwell
soldiers
close
at
his
heels
and
his
wife
a
lady
of
great
courage
had
scarcely
concealed
him
in
the
secret
chamber
when
the
enemy
arrived
to
search
the
house
little
daunted
the
lady
assisted
them
and
personally
conducted
them
over
the
mansion
as
in
so
many
instances
the
secret
room
was
entered
from
the
principal
bedroom
and
in
inspecting
the
latter
the
roundheads
had
their
suspicions
aroused
so
they
decided
to
stay
the
night
the
hunted
man
wife
sent
them
an
ample
supper
and
some
wine
which
had
been
carefully
drugged
with
the
result
that
the
unwelcome
visitors
were
very
soon
soundly
asleep
and
the
gallant
captain
before
the
effects
of
the
wine
had
worn
off
were
far
beyond
their
reach
since
that
day
the
old
place
had
remained
absolutely
unchanged
with
its
rows
of
dark
family
portraits
in
the
big
hall
its
jacobean
furniture
and
its
old
helmets
and
pikes
that
had
borne
the
brunt
of
naseby
the
night
was
bitterly
cold
in
the
great
open
hearth
huge
logs
were
blazing
and
as
we
stood
there
to
warm
ourselves
after
our
journey
gibbons
who
had
been
apprised
of
our
advent
by
telegraph
announced
that
she
had
prepared
supper
for
us
as
she
knew
we
could
not
arrive
in
time
for
dinner
both
she
and
her
husband
expressed
the
deepest
sympathy
with
mabel
in
her
bereavement
and
then
having
removed
our
coats
we
went
on
into
the
small
where
supper
was
served
by
gibbons
and
the
footman
with
that
stateliness
characteristic
of
all
in
that
fine
mansion
gibbons
and
his
wife
old
retainers
of
the
former
owners
were
i
think
somewhat
surprised
that
i
had
accompanied
their
young
mistress
alone
nevertheless
mabel
had
explained
to
them
how
she
wished
to
make
a
search
of
her
father
effects
in
the
library
and
that
for
that
reason
she
had
invited
me
to
accompany
her
yet
i
must
confess
that
i
on
my
part
had
not
yet
formed
any
conclusion
as
to
the
real
reason
of
her
visit
that
there
was
some
ulterior
motive
in
it
i
felt
certain
but
what
it
was
i
could
not
even
guess
after
supper
gibbons
took
my
pretty
companion
to
her
room
while
gibbons
showed
me
the
one
prepared
for
me
a
long
big
chamber
on
the
first
floor
from
the
windows
of
which
i
had
a
wide
view
over
the
undulating
lawns
to
wormsley
hill
and
sarnesfield
i
had
occupied
the
room
on
several
occasions
and
knew
it
well
with
its
great
old
carved
bed
antique
hangings
jacobean
chests
and
polished
oaken
ceiling
after
a
wash
i
rejoined
my
dainty
little
hostess
in
the
library
a
big
long
old
room
where
a
fire
burned
brightly
and
the
lamps
were
softly
shaded
with
yellow
silk
over
the
fireplace
were
craved
in
stone
the
three
of
the
baddesleys
with
the
date
while
the
whole
room
from
end
to
end
was
lined
with
books
that
had
probably
not
been
disturbed
for
after
mabel
had
allowed
me
a
cigarette
and
told
gibbons
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
for
an
hour
or
so
she
rose
and
turned
the
key
behind
the
servants
so
that
we
might
carry
out
the
work
of
investigation
without
interruption
now
she
said
turning
her
fine
eyes
upon
me
with
an
excitement
she
could
not
suppress
as
she
walked
to
the
big
and
took
her
father
keys
from
her
pocket
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
discover
anything
of
interest
i
suppose
she
added
it
is
really
leighton
duty
to
do
this
but
i
prefer
that
you
and
i
should
look
into
my
father
affairs
prior
to
the
inquisitive
lawyer
arrival
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
to
discover
something
which
she
desired
to
conceal
from
the
solicitor
the
dead
man
was
a
ponderous
one
of
carved
oak
and
as
she
unlocked
the
first
drawer
and
turned
out
its
contents
i
drew
up
chairs
and
settled
with
her
in
order
to
make
a
methodical
and
thorough
examination
the
papers
we
found
were
mostly
letters
from
friends
and
correspondence
from
solicitors
and
brokers
regarding
his
investments
in
various
quarters
from
some
which
i
read
i
gathered
what
enormous
profits
he
had
made
over
certain
deals
in
kaffirs
while
in
certain
other
correspondence
were
allusions
to
matters
which
to
me
were
very
puzzling
mabel
eager
attitude
was
that
of
one
in
search
of
some
document
or
other
which
she
believed
to
be
there
she
scarcely
troubled
to
read
any
of
the
letters
merely
scanning
them
swiftly
and
casting
them
aside
thus
we
examined
the
contents
of
one
drawer
after
another
until
i
saw
beneath
her
hand
a
blue
foolscap
envelope
sealed
with
black
wax
and
bearing
the
superscription
in
her
father
handwriting
to
be
opened
by
mabel
after
my
burton
blair
ah
she
gasped
in
breathless
haste
i
wonder
what
this
contains
and
she
eagerly
broke
the
seals
and
drew
forth
a
sheet
of
foolscap
closely
written
to
which
some
other
papers
were
attached
by
means
of
a
brass
fastener
from
the
envelope
too
something
fell
and
i
picked
it
up
finding
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
a
photograph
much
worn
and
tattered
but
preserved
by
being
mounted
upon
a
piece
of
linen
it
was
a
view
of
a
country
crossroads
in
a
flat
and
rather
dismal
country
with
a
small
lonely
house
probably
once
an
old
with
high
chimneys
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
highway
a
small
strip
of
railed
off
at
the
side
before
the
door
was
a
rustic
porch
covered
by
climbing
roses
and
out
on
the
roadside
an
old
windsor
armchair
that
had
apparently
just
been
vacated
while
i
was
examining
the
view
beneath
the
the
dead
daughter
was
reading
swiftly
through
those
close
lines
her
father
had
penned
suddenly
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
as
though
horrified
by
some
discovery
and
startled
i
turned
to
glance
at
her
her
countenance
had
changed
she
was
blanched
to
the
lips
no
she
gasped
hoarsely
i
i
ca
believe
it
i
wo
again
she
glanced
at
the
paper
to
those
fateful
lines
what
is
it
i
inquired
anxiously
may
i
not
know
and
i
crossed
to
where
she
stood
no
she
answered
firmly
placing
the
paper
behind
her
no
not
even
you
may
know
this
and
with
a
sudden
movement
she
tore
the
paper
to
pieces
in
her
hands
and
ere
i
could
rescue
it
she
had
cast
the
fragments
into
the
fire
the
flames
leapt
up
and
next
instant
the
dead
man
confession
if
such
it
were
was
consumed
and
lost
for
ever
while
his
daughter
stood
haggard
rigid
and
white
as
death
chapter
sixteen
in
which
two
curious
facts
are
established
mabel
sudden
action
both
annoyed
and
surprised
me
for
i
had
believed
that
our
friendship
was
of
such
a
close
and
intimate
character
that
she
would
at
least
have
allowed
me
sight
of
what
her
father
had
written
yet
when
next
second
i
reflected
that
the
envelope
had
been
specially
addressed
to
her
i
saw
that
whatever
was
contained
therein
had
been
intended
for
her
eye
alone
you
have
discovered
something
which
has
upset
you
i
said
looking
straight
into
her
white
face
i
hope
it
is
really
nothing
very
disconcerting
she
held
her
breath
for
a
moment
her
hand
instinctively
upon
her
breast
as
though
to
still
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
ah
unfortunately
it
is
was
her
answer
i
know
the
truth
now
the
awful
terrible
truth
and
without
a
word
of
warning
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
torrent
of
tears
at
her
side
in
an
instant
i
was
striving
to
console
her
but
i
quickly
realised
what
a
deep
impression
of
dismay
and
horror
those
written
words
of
her
dead
father
had
produced
upon
her
she
was
filled
with
grief
and
utterly
inconsolable
the
quiet
of
that
long
room
was
unbroken
save
for
her
bitter
sobs
and
the
solemn
of
the
antique
grandfather
clock
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
my
hand
was
placed
tenderly
upon
the
poor
girl
shoulder
but
it
was
a
long
time
ere
i
could
induce
her
to
dry
her
tears
when
she
did
so
i
saw
by
her
face
that
she
had
become
a
changed
woman
walking
back
to
the
she
took
up
the
envelope
and
the
superscription
which
blair
had
written
upon
it
and
then
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
photograph
of
that
lonely
house
by
the
crossways
why
she
cried
startled
where
did
you
find
this
i
explained
that
it
had
dropped
from
the
envelope
whereupon
she
took
it
up
and
gazed
for
a
long
time
upon
it
then
turning
it
over
she
discovered
what
i
had
not
noticed
namely
written
faintly
in
pencil
and
half
effaced
were
the
words
owston
crossroads
miles
beyond
doncaster
on
the
selby
b
b
do
you
know
what
this
is
no
i
have
the
least
idea
i
answered
it
must
be
something
of
which
your
father
was
very
careful
it
seems
to
be
well
worn
too
as
though
carried
in
somebody
pocket
well
she
said
i
will
tell
you
i
had
no
idea
that
he
still
preserved
it
but
i
suppose
he
kept
it
as
a
souvenir
of
those
weary
journeys
of
long
ago
this
photograph
she
added
holding
it
still
in
her
hand
is
the
picture
of
the
spot
for
which
he
searched
every
turnpike
in
england
he
had
the
photograph
but
nothing
else
to
guide
him
to
the
spot
and
we
were
therefore
compelled
to
tramp
all
the
main
roads
up
and
down
the
country
in
an
attempt
to
identify
it
not
until
nearly
a
year
after
you
and
seton
had
so
kindly
placed
me
at
school
at
bournemouth
did
my
father
still
on
his
lonely
tramp
succeed
in
discovering
it
after
a
search
lasting
over
three
years
he
identified
it
one
summer
evening
as
the
crossways
at
owston
and
he
found
living
in
that
house
the
person
of
whom
he
had
been
all
those
weary
months
in
search
curious
i
said
tell
me
more
about
it
there
is
nothing
else
to
tell
except
that
by
identifying
the
house
he
obtained
the
key
to
the
secret
at
least
that
is
what
i
always
understood
from
him
she
said
ah
i
recollect
all
those
long
wearying
walks
when
i
was
a
girl
how
we
trudged
on
over
those
long
white
endless
roads
in
sunshine
and
in
rain
envying
people
in
carriages
and
carts
and
men
and
women
on
bicycles
and
yet
my
courage
always
supported
by
my
father
declaration
that
great
fortune
must
be
ours
some
day
he
carried
this
photograph
with
him
always
and
almost
at
each
crossroad
he
would
take
it
out
examine
the
landscape
and
compare
it
not
knowing
of
course
but
that
the
old
might
have
been
pulled
down
since
the
taking
of
the
picture
did
he
never
tell
you
the
reason
why
he
wished
to
visit
that
house
he
used
to
say
that
the
man
who
lived
there
the
man
who
used
to
sit
on
summer
evenings
in
that
chair
outside
was
his
friend
his
good
friend
only
they
had
been
parted
for
a
long
time
and
he
did
not
know
that
my
father
was
still
alive
they
had
been
friends
abroad
i
fancy
in
the
days
when
my
father
was
at
sea
and
the
identification
of
this
spot
was
the
reason
of
your
constant
wanderings
i
exclaimed
pleased
that
i
had
at
last
cleared
up
one
point
which
for
five
years
or
so
had
been
a
mystery
yes
a
month
after
he
had
made
the
discovery
he
came
to
bournemouth
and
told
me
in
confidence
that
his
dream
of
great
wealth
was
about
to
be
realised
he
had
solved
the
problem
and
within
a
week
or
two
would
be
in
possession
of
ample
funds
he
disappeared
you
will
remember
almost
immediately
and
was
away
for
a
month
then
he
returned
a
rich
man
so
rich
that
you
and
seton
were
utterly
dumbfounded
do
you
recollect
that
night
at
helpstone
after
i
had
come
from
school
to
spend
a
week
with
my
father
on
his
return
we
were
sitting
together
after
dinner
and
poor
father
recalled
the
last
occasion
when
we
had
all
assembled
there
the
occasion
when
i
was
taken
ill
outside
she
added
and
do
you
recollect
seton
appearing
to
doubt
my
statement
that
he
was
already
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
i
remember
i
answered
as
her
clear
eyes
met
mine
i
remember
how
your
father
struck
us
utterly
dumb
by
going
upstairs
and
fetching
his
banker
which
showed
a
balance
of
thousand
odd
pounds
after
that
he
became
more
than
ever
a
mystery
to
us
but
tell
me
i
added
in
a
low
earnest
voice
what
have
you
discovered
that
has
so
upset
you
i
have
nearly
found
proof
of
a
fact
that
i
have
dreaded
for
years
a
fact
that
affects
not
only
my
poor
father
memory
but
also
myself
i
am
in
peril
personal
danger
how
i
asked
quickly
failing
to
understand
her
meaning
recollect
that
i
promised
your
father
to
act
as
your
protector
i
know
i
know
it
is
awfully
good
of
you
she
said
looking
at
me
gratefully
with
those
wonderful
eyes
that
had
always
held
me
fascinated
beneath
the
spell
of
her
beauty
but
she
added
shaking
her
head
sorrowfully
i
fear
that
in
this
you
will
be
powerless
if
the
blow
falls
as
it
must
sooner
or
later
then
i
shall
be
crushed
and
helpless
no
power
not
even
your
devoted
friendship
can
then
save
me
you
certainly
speak
very
strangely
mabel
i
do
follow
you
at
all
i
expect
not
was
her
mechanical
answer
you
do
not
know
all
if
you
did
you
would
understand
the
peril
of
my
position
and
of
the
great
danger
now
threatening
me
and
she
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
her
hand
upon
the
corner
of
the
her
eyes
fixed
straight
into
the
blazing
fire
if
the
danger
is
a
real
one
i
consider
i
ought
to
be
aware
of
it
to
be
forewarned
is
to
be
forearmed
i
remarked
decisively
it
is
a
real
one
but
as
my
father
has
confessed
the
truth
to
me
alone
i
am
unable
to
reveal
it
to
you
his
secret
is
mine
certainly
i
answered
accepting
her
decision
which
of
course
was
but
natural
in
the
circumstances
she
could
not
betray
her
dead
father
confidence
yet
if
she
had
done
how
altered
would
have
been
the
course
of
events
surely
the
story
of
burton
blair
was
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
romantic
ever
given
to
man
to
relate
and
as
assuredly
the
strange
circumstances
which
occurred
after
his
decease
were
even
more
remarkable
and
puzzling
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
was
a
complete
enigma
later
when
mabel
grew
slightly
calmer
we
concluded
our
work
of
investigation
but
discovered
little
else
of
interest
save
several
letters
in
italian
undated
and
unsigned
but
evidently
written
by
dick
dawson
the
millionaire
mysterious
friend
or
enemy
on
reading
them
they
were
i
found
evidently
the
correspondence
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
who
was
sharing
blair
fortune
and
secretly
assisting
him
in
the
acquisition
of
his
wealth
there
was
much
mention
of
the
secret
and
repeated
cautions
against
revealing
anything
to
reggie
or
to
myself
in
one
letter
i
found
the
sentences
in
italian
my
girl
is
growing
into
quite
a
fine
lady
i
expect
she
will
become
a
countess
or
perhaps
a
duchess
one
day
i
hear
from
your
side
that
mabel
is
becoming
a
very
pretty
woman
you
ought
with
your
position
and
reputation
to
make
a
good
match
for
her
but
i
know
what
ideas
you
hold
that
a
woman
must
marry
only
for
love
on
reading
this
one
fact
was
vividly
impressed
upon
me
namely
that
if
this
man
dawson
shared
secretly
in
blair
wealth
he
surely
had
no
necessity
to
obtain
his
secret
by
foul
means
when
he
already
knew
it
the
clock
on
the
stables
chimed
midnight
before
mabel
rang
for
gibbons
and
the
latter
husband
followed
bringing
me
a
of
whisky
and
some
hot
water
my
little
companion
merrily
pressed
my
hand
wishing
me
and
then
retired
accompanied
by
the
housekeeper
while
gibbons
himself
remained
to
mix
my
drink
sad
thing
sir
about
our
poor
master
hazarded
the
servant
who
had
been
all
his
life
in
the
service
of
the
previous
owners
i
fear
the
poor
young
mistress
feels
it
very
much
very
much
indeed
gibbons
i
answered
taking
a
cigarette
and
standing
with
my
back
to
the
fire
she
was
such
a
devoted
daughter
she
is
now
mistress
of
everything
ford
told
us
when
he
was
down
three
days
ago
yes
i
said
everything
and
i
hope
that
you
and
your
wife
will
serve
her
as
well
and
as
faithfully
as
you
have
done
her
father
we
try
sir
was
the
grave
man
response
everybody
very
fond
of
the
young
mistress
she
so
very
good
to
all
the
servants
then
as
i
remained
silent
he
placed
my
candle
in
readiness
on
the
table
and
bowing
wished
me
he
closed
the
door
and
i
was
alone
in
that
great
silent
old
room
where
the
darting
flames
cast
weird
lights
across
into
the
dark
recesses
and
the
long
old
chippendale
clock
ticked
on
solemnly
as
it
had
done
for
a
century
past
having
swallowed
my
hot
drink
i
returned
again
to
my
dead
carefully
examining
it
to
see
whether
it
contained
any
secret
drawers
a
methodical
investigation
of
every
portion
failed
to
reveal
any
spring
or
unsuspected
cavity
therefore
after
glancing
at
that
photograph
which
had
taken
blair
those
many
months
of
weary
tramping
to
identify
i
extinguished
the
lamps
and
passing
through
the
great
old
hall
with
the
stands
of
armour
which
conjured
up
visions
of
ghostly
cavaliers
ascended
to
my
room
the
bright
fire
gave
the
antique
place
with
those
rather
funereal
hangings
a
warm
and
cosy
appearance
in
contrast
to
the
hard
frost
outside
and
feeling
no
inclination
to
sleep
just
then
i
flung
my
self
into
an
and
sat
with
arms
folded
pondering
deeply
again
the
chimed
the
and
then
i
think
i
must
have
dozed
for
i
was
awakened
suddenly
by
a
light
stealthy
footstep
on
the
polished
oaken
floor
outside
my
door
i
listened
and
distinctly
heard
some
one
creeping
lightly
down
the
big
old
jacobean
staircase
which
creaked
slightly
somewhere
below
the
weird
ghostliness
of
the
old
place
and
its
many
historic
traditions
caused
me
i
suppose
some
misgivings
for
i
found
myself
thinking
of
burglars
and
of
midnight
visitants
again
i
strained
my
ears
perhaps
after
all
it
was
only
a
servant
yet
when
i
glanced
at
my
watch
and
found
it
to
be
a
quarter
to
two
the
suggestion
that
the
servants
had
not
retired
was
at
once
negatived
suddenly
in
the
room
below
me
i
distinctly
heard
a
slow
harsh
grating
noise
then
all
was
still
again
about
three
minutes
later
however
i
fancied
i
heard
low
whispering
and
having
quickly
extinguished
my
light
i
drew
aside
one
of
my
heavy
curtains
and
peering
forth
saw
to
my
surprise
two
figures
crossing
the
lawn
towards
the
shrubbery
the
moon
was
somewhat
overcast
yet
by
the
grey
clouded
light
i
distinguished
that
the
pair
were
a
man
and
a
woman
from
the
man
back
i
could
not
recognise
him
but
his
companion
gait
was
familiar
to
me
as
she
hurried
on
towards
the
dark
belt
of
bare
black
trees
it
was
mabel
blair
the
secret
was
out
her
sudden
desire
to
visit
mayvill
was
in
order
to
keep
a
midnight
tryst
chapter
seventeen
merely
concerns
a
stranger
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
struggled
into
an
overcoat
slipped
on
a
golf
cap
and
sped
downstairs
to
the
room
below
my
own
where
i
found
one
of
the
long
windows
open
and
through
it
stepped
quickly
out
upon
the
gravel
i
intended
to
discover
the
motive
of
this
meeting
and
the
identity
of
her
companion
evidently
some
secret
lover
whose
existence
she
had
concealed
from
us
all
yet
to
follow
her
straight
across
the
lawn
in
the
open
light
was
to
at
once
court
detection
therefore
i
was
compelled
to
take
a
circuitous
course
hugging
the
shadows
always
until
i
at
length
reached
the
shrubbery
where
i
halted
listening
eagerly
there
was
no
sound
beyond
the
low
creaking
of
the
branches
and
the
dismal
sighing
of
the
wind
a
distant
train
was
passing
through
the
valley
and
somewhere
away
down
in
the
village
a
collie
was
barking
i
could
not
however
distinguish
any
human
voices
slowly
i
made
my
way
through
the
fallen
leaves
until
i
had
skirted
the
whole
of
the
shrubbery
and
then
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
have
passed
through
it
by
some
bypath
and
gone
out
into
the
park
my
task
was
rendered
more
difficult
because
the
moon
was
not
sufficiently
overcast
to
conceal
my
movements
and
i
feared
that
by
emerging
into
the
open
i
might
betray
my
presence
but
mabel
action
in
coming
there
to
meet
this
man
whoever
he
was
puzzled
me
greatly
why
had
she
not
met
him
in
london
i
wondered
could
he
be
such
an
unpresentable
lover
that
a
journey
to
london
was
impossible
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
a
girl
to
fall
in
love
with
a
labourer
son
any
more
than
it
is
for
a
gentleman
to
love
a
peasant
girl
many
a
pretty
girl
in
london
has
a
secret
admiration
for
some
young
labourer
or
groom
on
her
estate
the
seriousness
of
the
unspoken
love
lying
in
the
utter
impossibility
of
its
realisation
with
ears
and
eyes
open
i
went
on
taking
advantage
of
all
the
shadow
i
could
but
it
seemed
as
though
having
nearly
five
minutes
start
of
me
they
had
taken
a
different
direction
to
that
which
i
believed
at
last
i
gained
the
comparative
gloom
of
the
old
beech
avenue
which
led
straight
down
to
the
lodge
on
the
dilwyn
road
and
continued
along
it
for
nearly
when
suddenly
my
heart
leaped
for
joy
for
i
distinguished
before
me
the
two
figures
walking
together
and
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
my
jealous
anger
was
in
an
instant
aroused
fearing
that
they
might
hear
my
footsteps
on
the
hard
frozen
road
i
slipped
outside
the
trees
upon
the
grass
of
the
park
and
treading
noiselessly
was
soon
able
to
approach
almost
level
with
them
without
attracting
attention
presently
on
the
old
stone
bridge
across
the
river
which
formed
the
outlet
of
the
lake
they
halted
when
concealing
myself
behind
a
tree
i
was
enabled
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
had
fortunately
now
grown
brighter
to
clearly
see
the
features
of
mabel
mysterious
companion
i
judged
him
to
be
about
an
fellow
whose
hulking
form
as
he
leaned
against
the
low
parapet
was
undoubtedly
that
of
an
agriculturist
his
face
was
and
prematurely
while
the
cut
of
his
clothes
was
distinctly
that
of
the
emporium
of
the
provincial
town
his
hard
felt
hat
was
cocked
a
little
askew
as
is
usual
with
the
yokel
as
well
as
with
the
costermonger
when
he
takes
his
sunday
walk
as
far
as
i
could
observe
he
seemed
to
be
treating
her
with
extraordinary
disdain
and
familiarity
addressing
her
as
mab
and
lighting
a
cheap
cigarette
in
her
presence
while
on
her
part
she
seemed
rather
ill
at
ease
as
though
she
were
there
under
compulsion
rather
than
by
choice
she
had
dressed
herself
warmly
in
a
thick
frieze
driving
cape
and
a
peaked
cap
which
drawn
over
her
eyes
her
features
i
really
ca
see
your
object
herbert
i
heard
her
distinctly
argue
what
could
such
an
action
possibly
benefit
you
a
lot
the
fellow
answered
adding
in
a
rough
uncouth
voice
which
bore
the
unmistakable
brogue
of
the
countryman
what
i
say
i
mean
you
know
that
do
yer
of
course
she
answered
but
why
do
you
treat
me
in
this
manner
think
of
the
risks
i
run
in
meeting
you
here
what
would
people
think
if
it
were
known
what
do
i
care
what
people
think
he
exclaimed
carelessly
of
course
you
got
to
keep
up
appearances
fortunately
i
ai
but
you
surely
wo
do
what
you
threaten
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
blank
dismay
remember
that
our
secrets
have
been
mutual
i
have
never
betrayed
you
never
in
any
single
thing
no
because
you
knew
what
would
be
the
result
if
you
did
he
laughed
with
a
sneer
i
never
trust
a
woman
word
i
do
you
rich
now
the
old
man
dead
and
i
want
money
he
said
decisively
but
i
have
any
yet
she
replied
when
will
you
have
some
i
do
know
there
are
all
sorts
of
law
formalities
to
go
through
before
so
greenwood
says
oh
a
curse
on
greenwood
the
fellow
burst
forth
he
always
with
you
up
in
london
they
say
ask
him
to
get
you
some
money
from
the
lawyers
tell
him
you
hard
up
got
to
pay
bills
or
something
any
lie
will
do
for
him
impossible
herbert
she
answered
trying
to
remain
calm
you
must
really
be
patient
oh
yes
i
know
he
cried
call
me
good
dog
and
all
that
but
that
kind
of
game
do
suit
me
you
hear
i
got
no
money
and
i
must
have
some
at
once
tonight
i
have
any
she
declared
but
you
got
lots
of
jewellery
and
plate
and
stuff
give
me
some
of
that
and
i
can
sell
it
easily
in
hereford
where
that
diamond
bracelet
the
old
man
gave
you
for
a
present
last
birthday
the
one
you
showed
me
here
she
replied
and
raised
her
wrist
showing
him
the
beautiful
diamond
and
sapphire
ornament
her
father
had
given
her
the
worth
of
which
was
two
hundred
pounds
at
the
very
least
give
me
that
he
said
it
last
me
a
day
or
two
until
you
get
me
some
cash
she
hesitated
evidently
indisposed
to
accede
to
such
a
request
and
more
especially
as
the
bracelet
was
the
last
present
her
father
had
made
her
yet
when
he
repeated
his
demands
in
a
more
threatening
tone
it
became
plain
that
the
fellow
influence
was
supreme
and
that
she
was
as
helpless
as
a
child
in
his
unscrupulous
hands
the
situation
came
upon
me
as
an
absolute
revelation
i
could
only
surmise
that
a
harmless
flirtation
in
the
years
before
her
affluence
had
developed
into
this
common
fellow
presuming
upon
her
good
nature
and
finding
her
generous
and
sympathetic
he
had
now
assumed
an
attitude
of
mastery
over
her
actions
the
working
of
the
rustic
mind
is
most
difficult
to
follow
in
rural
england
there
is
so
very
little
real
gratitude
shown
by
the
poor
towards
the
rich
that
in
the
country
districts
charity
is
almost
entirely
unappreciated
while
the
wealthy
are
becoming
weary
of
attempting
to
please
or
improve
the
people
your
rustic
of
while
perfectly
honest
in
his
dealings
with
his
own
class
can
not
resist
dishonesty
when
selling
his
produce
or
his
labour
to
the
rich
man
it
seems
part
of
his
religion
to
get
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
as
much
as
he
can
out
of
the
gentleman
and
then
abuse
him
in
the
village
and
dub
him
a
fool
for
allowing
himself
to
be
thus
cheated
much
as
i
regret
to
allege
it
nevertheless
it
is
a
plain
and
bitter
truth
that
swindling
and
immorality
are
the
two
most
notable
features
of
english
village
life
at
the
present
moment
i
stood
listening
to
that
strange
conversation
between
the
daughter
and
her
secret
lover
immovable
and
astounded
the
arrogance
of
the
fellow
caused
my
blood
to
boil
a
dozen
times
as
he
sneered
at
her
insultingly
now
cajoling
now
threatening
and
now
making
a
disgusting
pretence
of
affection
i
felt
impelled
to
rush
out
and
give
him
a
good
sound
hiding
it
was
indeed
only
because
i
recognised
that
in
this
affair
so
serious
was
it
i
could
only
assist
mabel
by
remaining
concealed
and
using
my
knowledge
of
it
to
her
advantage
that
i
held
my
tongue
and
stayed
my
hand
without
doubt
she
had
in
her
girlish
inexperience
once
believed
herself
in
love
with
the
fellow
but
now
the
hideousness
of
the
present
situation
was
presented
to
her
in
all
its
vivid
reality
and
she
saw
herself
hopelessly
involved
probably
it
was
with
a
vain
hope
of
extricating
herself
that
she
had
kept
the
appointment
but
in
any
case
the
man
whom
she
called
herbert
was
quick
to
detect
that
he
held
all
the
honours
in
the
game
now
come
he
said
at
last
in
his
broad
brogue
if
you
really
got
no
money
on
you
hand
over
that
bracelet
and
ha
done
with
it
we
do
want
to
wait
all
night
for
i
got
to
be
in
hereford
first
thing
in
the
morning
so
the
least
said
the
better
i
saw
that
white
to
the
lips
she
was
trembling
in
fear
of
him
for
she
shrank
from
his
touch
crying
ah
herbert
it
is
too
cruel
of
you
too
cruel
after
all
i
done
to
help
you
have
you
no
pity
no
compassion
none
he
growled
i
want
money
and
must
have
it
in
a
week
you
must
pay
me
a
thousand
quid
you
hear
that
do
you
but
how
can
i
wait
and
i
give
it
to
you
later
indeed
i
promise
i
tell
you
i
ai
going
to
be
fooled
he
cried
angrily
i
mean
to
have
the
money
or
else
i
blow
the
whole
thing
then
where
will
you
be
eh
and
he
laughed
a
hard
triumphant
laugh
while
she
shrank
back
pale
breathless
and
dismayed
i
clenched
my
fists
and
to
this
moment
i
do
not
know
how
i
restrained
myself
from
springing
from
my
and
knocking
the
fellow
down
at
that
moment
i
could
have
killed
him
where
he
stood
ah
she
cried
her
hands
clasped
to
him
in
a
gesture
of
supplication
you
surely
do
mean
what
you
say
you
ca
mean
that
you
really
ca
you
spare
me
wo
you
promise
me
no
i
wo
spare
you
was
his
brutal
reply
unless
you
pay
me
well
i
will
i
will
she
assured
him
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
which
was
eminently
that
of
a
desperate
woman
terrified
lest
some
terrible
secret
of
hers
should
be
exposed
ah
he
sneered
with
curling
lip
you
treated
me
with
contempt
once
because
you
were
a
fine
lady
but
i
am
yet
to
have
my
revenge
as
you
will
see
you
are
now
mistress
of
a
great
fortune
and
i
tell
you
quite
plainly
that
i
intend
you
to
share
it
with
me
act
just
as
you
think
best
but
recollect
what
refusal
will
mean
to
you
exposure
ah
she
cried
desperately
you
have
revealed
yourself
in
your
true
light
you
brute
you
would
without
the
slightest
compunction
ruin
me
because
my
dear
girl
you
are
not
playing
straight
was
his
cool
arrogant
reply
you
thought
that
you
had
most
ingeniously
got
rid
of
me
for
ever
until
here
i
am
you
see
back
again
ready
to
well
to
be
pensioned
off
shall
we
call
it
do
think
i
intend
to
allow
you
to
fool
me
this
time
so
just
give
me
the
bracelet
as
a
first
instalment
and
say
no
more
and
he
snatched
at
her
arm
while
she
by
a
quick
movement
avoided
him
i
refuse
she
cried
with
a
fierce
and
sudden
determination
i
know
you
now
you
are
brutal
and
inhuman
without
a
speck
of
either
love
or
esteem
a
man
who
would
drive
a
woman
to
suicide
in
order
to
get
money
now
you
have
been
released
from
prison
you
intend
to
live
upon
me
your
letter
with
that
proposal
is
sufficient
proof
but
i
tell
you
here
that
you
will
obtain
not
a
penny
more
from
me
beyond
the
money
that
is
now
paid
you
every
month
to
keep
my
mouth
closed
he
interrupted
and
i
saw
an
evil
murderous
glitter
in
his
black
eyes
you
need
not
keep
it
closed
any
longer
she
said
in
open
defiance
indeed
i
shall
tell
the
truth
myself
and
thus
put
an
end
to
this
brilliant
blackmailing
scheme
of
yours
so
now
you
understand
she
added
firmly
with
a
courage
that
was
admirable
a
silence
fell
between
them
for
a
moment
broken
only
by
the
weird
cry
of
an
owl
then
that
is
absolutely
your
decision
eh
he
inquired
in
a
hard
voice
while
i
noticed
that
his
face
was
white
with
anger
and
chagrin
as
he
recognised
that
if
she
told
the
truth
and
faced
the
consequence
of
her
own
exposure
whatever
it
might
be
his
power
over
her
would
be
dispelled
my
mind
is
made
up
i
have
no
fear
of
any
exposure
you
may
make
concerning
me
at
any
rate
give
me
that
bracelet
he
demanded
savagely
with
set
teeth
grasping
her
arm
and
trying
by
force
to
undo
the
clasp
let
me
go
she
cried
you
brute
let
me
go
would
you
rob
me
as
well
as
insult
me
rob
you
he
muttered
his
coarse
white
face
wearing
a
dangerous
expression
of
unbridled
hatred
rob
you
he
hissed
with
a
ford
oath
i
do
more
i
put
you
where
your
cursed
tongue
wo
wag
again
and
where
you
wo
be
able
to
tell
the
truth
and
unfortunately
before
i
was
aware
of
his
intentions
he
had
seized
her
by
the
wrists
and
with
a
quick
movement
forced
her
backwards
so
violently
against
the
low
parapet
of
the
bridge
that
for
a
moment
they
stood
locked
in
a
deadly
embrace
mabel
screamed
on
realising
his
intentions
but
next
second
with
a
vile
imprecation
he
had
forced
her
backwards
over
the
low
wall
and
with
a
loud
splash
she
fell
helplessly
into
the
deep
dark
waters
in
an
instant
while
the
fellow
took
to
his
heels
i
dashed
forward
to
her
rescue
but
alas
too
late
for
as
i
peered
eagerly
down
into
the
darkness
i
saw
to
my
dismay
that
the
swirling
icy
flood
had
closed
over
her
that
she
had
disappeared
chapter
eighteen
the
crossways
at
owston
the
sound
of
the
assassin
footsteps
as
he
escaped
away
down
the
dark
avenue
towards
the
road
awakened
me
to
a
keen
sense
of
my
responsibility
and
in
an
instant
i
had
divested
myself
of
my
overcoat
and
coat
and
stood
peering
anxiously
into
the
darkness
beneath
the
bridge
those
seconds
seemed
hours
until
of
a
sudden
i
caught
sight
of
a
flash
of
white
in
mid
stream
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
dived
in
after
it
the
shock
of
the
icy
water
was
a
severe
one
but
fortunately
i
am
a
strong
swimmer
and
neither
the
intense
coldness
nor
the
strength
of
the
current
interfered
much
with
my
progress
as
i
struck
out
towards
the
unconscious
girl
having
seized
her
however
i
had
to
battle
severely
to
prevent
being
swept
out
around
the
bend
where
i
knew
that
the
river
joined
by
another
stream
broadened
out
and
where
any
chances
of
effecting
a
rescue
would
be
very
small
for
some
minutes
i
struggled
with
all
my
might
to
hold
the
unconscious
girl
head
above
the
surface
yet
so
strong
was
the
swirling
flood
with
its
lumps
of
floating
ice
that
all
resistance
seemed
impossible
and
we
were
both
swept
down
for
some
distance
until
at
last
summoning
my
last
effort
i
managed
to
strike
out
with
my
senseless
burden
and
reach
a
shallow
where
i
managed
by
dint
of
fierce
struggling
to
land
and
to
drag
the
unfortunate
girl
up
the
frozen
bank
i
had
once
long
ago
attended
an
ambulance
class
and
now
acting
upon
the
instructions
i
had
there
received
i
set
at
once
to
work
to
produce
artificial
respiration
it
was
heavy
work
alone
with
my
wet
clothes
freezing
stiff
upon
me
but
still
i
persevered
determined
if
possible
to
restore
her
to
consciousness
and
this
i
was
fortunately
able
to
do
within
half
an
hour
at
first
she
could
utter
no
word
and
i
did
not
question
her
sufficient
was
it
for
me
to
know
that
she
was
still
alive
for
when
first
i
had
brought
her
to
land
i
believed
that
she
was
beyond
human
aid
and
that
the
dastardly
attempt
of
her
lover
had
been
successful
she
shivered
from
head
to
foot
for
the
night
wind
cut
like
a
knife
and
presently
at
my
suggestion
she
rose
and
leaning
heavily
upon
my
arm
tried
to
walk
the
attempt
was
at
first
only
a
feeble
one
but
presently
she
quickened
her
pace
slightly
and
without
either
of
us
mentioning
what
had
occurred
i
conducted
her
up
the
long
avenue
back
to
the
house
once
within
she
declared
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
call
gibbons
in
low
whispers
she
implored
me
to
remain
silent
upon
what
had
occurred
she
took
my
hand
in
hers
and
held
it
i
want
you
if
you
will
to
forget
all
that
has
transpired
she
said
deeply
in
earnest
if
you
followed
me
and
overheard
what
passed
between
us
i
want
you
to
consider
that
those
words
have
never
been
uttered
i
i
want
you
to
she
faltered
and
then
paused
without
concluding
her
sentence
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
i
inquired
after
a
brief
and
painful
silence
i
want
you
to
still
regard
me
with
some
esteem
as
you
always
have
done
she
said
bursting
into
tears
i
do
like
to
think
that
fallen
in
your
estimation
remember
i
am
a
woman
and
may
be
forgiven
a
woman
impulses
and
follies
you
have
not
fallen
in
my
estimation
at
all
mabel
i
assured
her
my
only
regret
is
that
the
scoundrel
made
such
an
outrageous
attempt
upon
you
but
it
was
fortunate
that
i
followed
you
although
i
suppose
i
ought
to
apologise
to
you
for
acting
the
eavesdropper
you
saved
my
life
was
her
whispered
answer
as
she
pressed
my
hand
in
thanks
then
she
crept
swiftly
and
silently
up
the
big
staircase
and
was
lost
to
view
next
morning
she
appeared
at
the
looking
apparently
little
the
worse
for
her
narrow
escape
save
perhaps
that
around
her
eyes
were
dark
rings
that
told
of
sleeplessness
and
terrible
anxiety
but
she
nevertheless
chatted
merrily
as
though
no
care
weighed
upon
her
mind
while
gibbons
was
in
the
room
serving
us
she
could
not
speak
confidentially
but
as
she
looked
across
at
me
her
glance
was
full
of
meaning
at
last
when
we
had
finished
and
had
walked
together
across
the
great
hall
back
to
the
library
i
said
to
her
shall
you
allow
the
regrettable
incident
of
last
night
to
pass
unnoticed
if
you
do
i
fear
that
man
may
make
another
attempt
upon
you
therefore
it
will
surely
be
better
if
he
understands
once
and
for
all
that
i
was
a
witness
of
his
dastardly
cowardice
no
she
replied
in
a
low
pained
voice
please
do
let
us
discuss
it
it
must
pass
why
because
if
i
were
to
seek
to
punish
him
he
might
bring
forward
something
something
that
i
wish
kept
secret
i
knew
that
i
recollected
every
word
of
that
heated
conversation
the
blackmailer
held
some
secret
of
hers
which
being
detrimental
she
dreaded
might
be
revealed
surely
it
was
all
a
strange
and
most
remarkable
enigma
from
beginning
to
end
from
that
winter
night
on
the
highway
near
helpstone
when
i
had
found
her
fallen
at
the
wayside
until
that
very
moment
mystery
had
piled
upon
mystery
and
secret
upon
secret
until
with
burton
decease
and
with
the
pack
of
tiny
cards
he
had
so
curiously
bequeathed
to
me
the
problem
had
assumed
gigantic
proportions
that
man
would
have
murdered
you
mabel
i
said
you
are
is
fear
of
him
i
am
she
answered
simply
her
gaze
fixed
across
the
lawn
and
park
beyond
and
she
sighed
but
ought
you
not
to
assume
the
defensive
now
that
the
fellow
has
deliberately
endeavoured
to
take
your
life
i
argued
his
villainous
action
last
night
was
purely
criminal
it
was
she
said
in
a
blank
hollow
voice
turning
her
eyes
upon
me
i
had
no
idea
of
his
intention
i
confess
that
i
came
down
here
because
he
compelled
me
to
meet
him
he
has
heard
of
my
father
death
and
now
realises
that
he
can
obtain
money
from
me
that
i
shall
be
forced
to
yield
to
his
demands
you
may
surely
tell
me
his
name
i
said
herbert
hales
she
replied
not
however
without
some
hesitation
then
she
added
but
i
do
wish
greenwood
you
would
do
me
a
favour
and
not
mention
the
painful
affair
again
you
do
not
know
how
it
upsets
me
or
how
much
depends
upon
that
man
silence
i
promised
although
before
doing
so
i
tried
my
level
best
to
induce
her
to
give
me
some
clue
to
the
nature
of
the
secret
held
by
the
uncouth
yokel
but
she
was
still
obdurate
and
refused
to
tell
me
anything
that
the
secret
was
something
which
affected
herself
or
her
own
honour
seemed
quite
plain
for
at
every
suggestion
of
mine
to
bring
the
fellow
face
to
face
with
her
she
shrank
in
fear
of
the
startling
revelation
he
could
make
i
wondered
whether
that
document
for
her
eyes
only
which
had
been
written
by
the
man
now
dead
and
which
she
had
destroyed
on
the
previous
night
had
any
connexion
with
the
secret
known
by
herbert
hales
indeed
whatever
the
nature
of
that
fellow
knowledge
it
was
potent
enough
to
compel
her
to
travel
down
from
london
in
order
if
possible
i
supposed
to
arrange
terms
with
him
fortunately
however
the
household
at
mayvill
was
unaware
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
and
when
at
midday
we
left
again
to
return
to
london
gibbons
and
his
wife
stood
at
the
door
and
wished
us
both
a
pleasant
journey
the
house
steward
and
his
wife
of
course
believed
that
the
object
of
our
flying
visit
was
to
search
the
dead
man
effects
and
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
servants
both
were
eager
to
know
whether
we
had
discovered
anything
of
interest
although
they
were
unable
to
question
us
directly
inquisitiveness
increases
with
a
servant
trustworthiness
until
the
confidential
servant
usually
knows
as
much
of
his
master
or
affairs
as
they
do
themselves
burton
blair
had
been
particularly
fond
of
the
gibbonses
and
it
almost
seemed
as
though
the
latter
considered
themselves
slighted
by
not
being
informed
of
every
disposition
made
by
their
dead
master
in
his
will
as
it
was
we
only
told
them
of
one
the
legacy
of
two
hundred
pounds
apiece
which
blair
had
left
them
and
this
had
of
course
caused
them
the
most
profound
gratification
having
deposited
mabel
at
grosvenor
square
and
taken
lingering
leave
of
her
i
returned
at
once
to
great
russell
street
and
found
that
reggie
had
just
returned
from
the
warehouse
in
cannon
street
acting
upon
my
sweet
little
friend
appeal
i
told
him
nothing
of
the
exciting
incident
of
the
previous
night
all
i
explained
was
the
searching
of
blair
and
what
we
had
discovered
there
well
we
ought
i
think
to
go
and
see
that
house
by
the
crossways
he
said
when
he
had
seen
the
photograph
doncaster
is
a
quick
run
from
king
cross
we
could
get
there
and
back
i
interested
to
see
the
house
to
discover
which
poor
blair
tramped
all
over
england
this
must
have
come
into
his
possession
he
added
handling
the
photograph
without
any
name
or
any
clue
whatever
to
its
situation
i
agreed
that
we
ought
to
go
and
see
for
ourselves
therefore
after
spending
a
quiet
evening
at
the
devonshire
we
left
by
the
early
train
next
day
for
yorkshire
on
arrival
at
doncaster
station
to
which
we
ran
through
from
london
without
a
stop
we
took
a
fly
and
drove
out
upon
the
broad
snowy
highroad
through
bentley
for
about
six
miles
or
so
until
after
skirting
owston
park
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
crossroads
where
stood
the
lonely
old
house
just
as
shown
in
the
photograph
it
was
a
quaint
old
place
like
one
of
those
old
one
sees
in
ancient
prints
the
old
bar
being
of
course
missing
the
however
still
remained
and
snow
having
fallen
in
the
night
the
scene
presented
was
truly
wintry
and
picturesque
the
antique
house
with
its
broad
smoking
chimney
at
the
end
had
apparently
been
added
to
since
the
photograph
had
been
taken
for
at
right
angles
was
a
new
wing
of
red
brick
converting
it
into
quite
a
comfortable
abode
yet
as
we
approached
the
old
place
rising
out
of
the
white
plain
breathed
mutely
of
those
forgotten
days
when
the
york
and
london
coaches
passed
it
when
masked
lurked
in
these
dark
fir
plantations
which
stood
out
beyond
the
open
common
at
kirkhouse
green
and
when
the
were
never
tired
of
singing
the
praises
of
those
wonderful
cheeses
at
the
old
in
stilton
our
driver
passed
the
place
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
on
we
stopped
him
alighted
and
walked
back
together
ordering
the
man
to
await
us
on
knocking
at
the
door
an
aged
old
woman
in
cap
and
ribbons
opened
it
whereupon
reggie
who
assumed
the
position
of
spokesman
made
excuse
that
we
were
passing
and
noticing
by
its
exterior
that
the
place
was
evidently
an
old
could
not
resist
the
inducement
to
call
and
request
to
be
allowed
to
look
within
i
sure
you
very
welcome
gentlemen
answered
the
woman
in
her
broad
yorkshire
dialect
it
an
old
place
and
lots
o
folk
have
been
here
and
looked
over
it
in
my
time
across
the
room
were
the
black
old
beams
of
two
centuries
before
the
old
looked
warm
and
cosy
with
its
oaken
settle
and
the
big
pot
simmering
upon
the
fire
the
furniture
too
was
little
changed
since
the
old
coaching
days
while
about
the
place
was
a
general
air
of
affluence
and
comfort
you
lived
here
a
long
time
i
suppose
reggie
inquired
when
we
had
glanced
around
and
noted
the
little
lancet
window
in
the
whence
the
in
the
old
days
could
obtain
a
view
for
miles
along
the
highroad
that
ran
away
across
the
open
moorlands
i
been
here
this
years
come
next
michaelmas
and
your
husband
oh
he
here
she
laughed
then
called
come
here
henry
where
are
you
and
then
she
added
he
never
left
here
once
since
he
came
home
from
sea
eighteen
years
ago
we
both
so
very
attached
to
the
old
place
a
bit
lonely
folks
would
call
it
but
burghwallis
is
only
a
mile
away
at
mention
of
her
husband
return
from
sea
we
both
pricked
up
our
ears
here
was
evidently
the
man
for
whom
burton
blair
had
searched
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
chapter
nineteen
which
contains
a
clue
a
door
opened
and
there
came
forward
a
tall
thin
wiry
old
man
with
white
hair
and
a
pointed
grey
beard
he
had
evidently
retired
on
our
arrival
in
order
to
change
his
coat
for
he
wore
a
blue
reefer
jacket
which
had
had
but
little
wear
but
the
collar
of
which
was
twisted
showing
that
he
had
only
that
moment
assumed
it
his
face
was
deeply
wrinkled
with
long
straight
furrows
across
the
brows
the
countenance
of
a
man
who
for
years
had
been
exposed
to
rigours
of
wind
and
weather
in
varying
climates
having
welcomed
us
he
laughed
lightly
when
we
explained
our
admiration
for
old
houses
we
were
londoners
we
explained
and
and
their
associations
with
the
antiquated
locomotion
of
the
past
always
charmed
us
yes
he
said
in
a
rather
refined
voice
for
such
a
rough
exterior
they
were
exciting
days
those
nowadays
the
motor
car
has
taken
the
place
of
the
picturesque
coach
and
team
and
they
rush
past
here
backwards
and
forwards
blowing
their
horns
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
half
the
time
we
have
a
constable
lying
in
wait
in
the
back
garden
ready
to
time
them
on
to
campsall
and
take
to
the
petty
sessions
afterwards
he
laughed
and
fancy
this
at
the
very
spot
where
claude
duval
held
up
the
duke
of
northumberland
and
afterwards
gallantly
escorted
lady
mary
percy
back
to
selby
the
old
fellow
seemed
to
deplore
the
passing
of
the
good
old
days
for
he
was
one
of
what
is
known
as
the
old
school
full
of
prejudices
against
every
idea
whether
it
be
in
medicine
religion
or
politics
and
declaring
that
when
he
was
a
youth
men
were
men
and
could
hold
their
own
successfully
against
the
foreigner
either
in
the
peace
of
commerce
or
in
the
clash
of
arms
to
my
utter
surprise
he
told
us
that
his
name
was
hales
the
same
as
that
of
mabel
secret
lover
and
as
we
chatted
with
him
we
learned
that
he
had
been
a
good
many
years
at
sea
mostly
in
the
atlantic
and
mediterranean
trades
well
you
seem
pretty
comfortable
now
i
remarked
smiling
a
cosy
house
a
good
wife
and
everything
to
make
you
happy
you
right
he
answered
taking
down
a
long
clay
pipe
from
the
rack
over
the
open
hearth
a
man
wants
nowt
more
i
contented
enough
and
i
only
wish
everybody
in
yorkshire
was
as
comfortable
this
hard
weather
the
aged
pair
seemed
flattered
at
receiving
us
as
visitors
and
offered
us
a
glass
of
ale
it
you
know
declared
hales
the
likes
of
us
ca
afford
wine
just
taste
it
she
urged
and
being
thus
pressed
we
were
glad
of
an
excuse
to
extend
our
visit
the
old
lady
had
bustled
out
to
the
kitchen
to
fetch
glasses
when
reggie
rose
to
his
feet
closed
the
door
quickly
and
turning
to
hales
said
in
a
low
voice
we
want
to
have
five
minutes
private
conversation
with
you
hales
do
you
recognise
this
and
he
drew
forth
the
photograph
and
held
it
before
the
old
man
eyes
why
it
a
picture
o
my
house
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
but
what
the
matter
nothing
only
just
answer
my
questions
they
are
most
important
and
our
real
object
in
coming
here
is
to
put
them
to
you
first
have
you
ever
known
a
man
named
blair
burton
blair
burton
blair
echoed
the
old
fellow
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
as
he
leaned
forward
intently
yes
why
he
discovered
a
secret
did
he
yes
through
me
made
millions
out
of
it
they
say
when
did
you
last
see
him
about
five
or
six
years
ago
when
he
discovered
you
living
here
that
it
he
searched
every
road
in
england
to
find
me
you
gave
him
this
photograph
no
i
think
he
stole
it
where
did
you
first
meet
him
on
board
the
in
the
port
of
antwerp
he
was
at
sea
like
myself
but
why
do
you
wish
to
know
all
this
because
answered
reggie
burton
blair
is
dead
and
his
secret
has
been
bequeathed
to
my
friend
here
gilbert
greenwood
burton
blair
dead
cried
the
old
man
jumping
to
his
feet
as
though
he
had
received
a
shock
burton
dead
does
dicky
dawson
know
this
yes
and
he
is
in
london
i
replied
ah
he
ejaculated
with
impatience
as
though
the
premature
knowledge
held
by
the
man
dawson
had
upset
all
his
plans
who
told
him
how
the
devil
did
he
know
i
had
to
confess
ignorance
but
in
reply
to
his
demand
i
deplored
the
tragic
suddenness
of
our
friend
decease
and
how
i
had
been
left
in
possession
of
the
pack
of
cards
upon
which
the
cipher
had
been
written
have
you
any
idea
what
his
secret
really
was
asked
the
wiry
old
fellow
i
mean
of
where
his
great
wealth
came
from
none
whatever
was
my
reply
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
something
no
he
snapped
i
ca
he
became
suddenly
rich
although
only
a
month
or
so
before
he
was
on
tramp
and
starving
he
found
me
and
i
gave
him
certain
information
for
which
i
was
afterwards
well
repaid
it
was
this
information
he
told
me
which
formed
the
key
to
the
secret
was
it
anything
to
do
with
this
pack
of
cards
and
the
cipher
i
inquired
eagerly
i
do
know
i
never
seen
the
cards
you
mention
when
he
arrived
here
one
cold
night
he
was
exhausted
and
starving
and
dead
beat
i
gave
him
a
meal
and
a
bed
and
told
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
next
morning
with
money
borrowed
from
me
he
took
train
to
london
and
the
next
i
heard
of
him
was
a
letter
which
stated
that
he
had
paid
into
the
county
bank
at
york
to
my
credit
one
thousand
pounds
as
we
had
arranged
to
be
the
price
of
the
information
and
i
tell
you
gentlemen
nobody
was
more
surprised
than
i
was
to
receive
a
letter
from
the
bank
next
day
confirming
it
he
afterwards
deposited
a
similar
sum
in
the
bank
on
the
first
of
january
every
year
as
a
little
present
he
said
then
you
never
saw
him
after
the
night
that
his
search
for
you
was
successful
no
not
once
hales
answered
addressing
his
wife
who
had
just
entered
saying
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
private
conversation
and
requesting
her
to
leave
us
which
she
did
burton
blair
was
a
queer
character
hales
continued
addressing
me
he
always
was
no
better
sailor
ever
ate
salt
junk
he
was
absolutely
fearless
and
a
splendid
navigator
he
knew
the
mediterranean
as
other
men
know
cable
street
whitechapel
and
had
led
a
life
of
adventure
but
he
was
a
reckless
devil
ashore
very
reckless
i
remember
once
how
we
both
narrowly
escaped
with
our
lives
at
a
little
town
outside
algiers
he
pulled
an
arab
girl
veil
off
her
face
out
of
sheer
mischief
and
when
she
raised
the
alarm
we
had
to
make
ourselves
scarce
pretty
quick
i
can
tell
you
and
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
recollection
of
certain
sprees
ashore
but
both
he
and
i
had
had
pretty
tough
times
in
the
cameroons
and
in
the
andes
i
was
older
than
he
and
when
i
first
met
him
i
laughed
at
what
i
believed
to
be
his
ignorance
but
i
soon
saw
that
he
crammed
about
double
the
amount
of
travelling
and
adventure
into
his
short
spell
than
ever
i
had
done
for
he
had
a
happy
knack
of
deserting
and
going
up
country
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
fought
in
revolutions
in
central
and
south
america
and
used
to
declare
that
the
rebels
in
guatemala
had
on
one
occasion
elected
him
minister
of
commerce
yes
i
agreed
he
was
in
many
ways
a
most
remarkable
man
with
a
most
remarkable
history
his
life
was
a
mystery
from
beginning
to
end
and
it
is
that
mystery
which
now
after
his
death
i
am
trying
to
unravel
ah
i
fear
you
find
it
a
very
difficult
task
replied
his
old
friend
shaking
his
head
blair
was
secret
in
everything
he
never
let
his
right
hand
know
what
his
left
did
you
could
never
get
at
the
bottom
of
his
ingenuity
or
at
his
motives
and
he
added
as
though
it
were
an
afterthought
can
you
assign
any
reason
why
he
should
have
left
his
secret
in
your
hands
well
only
gratitude
i
replied
i
was
able
on
one
occasion
to
render
him
a
little
assistance
i
know
he
told
me
all
about
it
how
you
had
both
put
his
girl
to
school
and
all
that
but
he
went
on
blair
had
some
motive
when
he
left
you
that
unintelligible
cipher
depend
upon
it
he
knew
well
enough
that
you
would
never
obtain
its
solution
alone
why
because
others
had
tried
before
you
and
failed
who
are
they
i
inquired
much
surprised
dick
dawson
is
one
if
he
had
succeeded
he
might
have
stood
in
shoes
a
millionaire
only
he
was
quite
cute
enough
and
the
secret
passed
on
to
your
friend
then
you
do
anticipate
that
i
shall
ever
discover
the
solution
of
the
cipher
no
answered
the
old
man
very
frankly
i
do
but
what
of
his
girl
mabel
i
think
she
was
called
she
in
london
and
has
inherited
everything
i
replied
whereat
the
old
fellow
furrowed
face
broadened
into
a
grim
smile
and
he
remarked
a
fine
catch
for
some
young
fellow
she
make
ah
if
you
could
induce
her
to
tell
all
she
knows
she
could
place
you
in
possession
of
her
father
secret
does
she
actually
know
it
i
cried
quickly
are
you
certain
of
this
i
am
she
knows
the
truth
ask
her
i
will
i
declared
but
can
not
you
tell
us
the
nature
of
the
information
you
gave
to
blair
on
that
night
when
he
you
i
asked
persuasively
no
he
replied
in
a
decisive
tone
it
was
a
confidential
matter
and
must
remain
as
such
i
was
paid
for
my
services
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
wiped
my
hands
of
the
affair
but
you
could
tell
me
something
concerning
this
strange
quest
of
blair
something
i
mean
that
might
put
me
on
the
track
of
the
solution
of
the
secret
the
secret
of
how
he
gained
his
wealth
you
mean
eh
of
course
ah
my
dear
sir
you
never
discover
that
mark
me
if
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
burton
blair
took
jolly
good
care
to
hide
that
from
everybody
and
he
was
well
assisted
by
such
men
as
your
self
i
said
rather
impertinently
i
fear
perhaps
perhaps
so
he
said
quickly
his
face
flushing
i
promised
him
secrecy
and
i
kept
my
promise
for
i
owe
my
present
comfortable
circumstances
solely
to
his
generosity
a
millionaire
can
do
anything
of
course
his
money
secures
him
his
friends
friends
yes
replied
the
old
man
gravely
but
not
happiness
poor
burton
blair
was
one
of
the
unhappiest
of
men
that
i
am
quite
certain
of
he
spoke
the
truth
i
knew
the
millionaire
had
himself
many
times
declared
to
me
in
confidence
that
he
had
been
far
happier
in
his
days
of
penury
and
careless
adventure
beyond
the
seas
than
as
possessor
of
that
great
west
end
mansion
and
the
first
estate
in
herefordshire
look
here
exclaimed
hales
suddenly
glancing
keenly
from
reggie
to
myself
i
give
you
warning
and
he
dropped
his
voice
to
almost
a
whisper
you
say
that
dick
dawson
has
returned
beware
of
him
he
means
mischief
you
may
bet
your
hat
on
that
be
very
careful
of
his
girl
too
she
knows
more
than
you
think
we
have
a
faint
suspicion
that
blair
did
not
die
a
natural
death
i
remarked
you
have
he
exclaimed
starting
what
causes
you
to
anticipate
that
the
circumstances
were
so
remarkable
i
replied
and
continuing
i
explained
the
tragic
affair
just
as
i
have
written
it
here
you
do
suspect
dicky
dawson
i
suppose
the
old
fellow
asked
anxiously
why
had
he
any
motive
for
getting
rid
of
our
friend
ah
i
do
know
dicky
is
a
very
funny
customer
he
always
held
blair
beneath
his
thumb
they
were
a
truly
remarkable
pair
the
one
blossoming
forth
into
a
millionaire
and
the
other
living
strictly
in
secret
somewhere
abroad
in
italy
i
think
dawson
must
have
had
some
very
strong
motive
for
remaining
so
quiet
i
observed
because
he
was
compelled
answered
hales
with
a
mysterious
shake
of
the
head
there
were
reasons
why
he
should
show
his
face
myself
i
wonder
why
he
has
dared
to
do
so
now
what
i
cried
eagerly
is
he
wanted
by
the
police
or
something
well
answered
the
old
man
after
some
hesitation
i
do
think
welcome
a
visit
from
any
of
those
inquisitive
gentlemen
from
scotland
yard
only
remember
i
make
no
charges
none
at
all
if
however
he
attempts
any
sharp
practice
you
may
just
casually
mention
that
harry
hales
is
still
alive
and
is
thinking
of
coming
up
to
london
to
pay
him
a
morning
call
just
watch
what
effect
those
words
will
have
upon
him
and
the
old
man
chuckled
to
himself
adding
ah
dawson
you
got
to
reckon
with
me
yet
i
fancy
then
you
assist
us
i
cried
in
eagerness
you
can
save
mabel
blair
if
you
will
i
do
all
i
can
was
hales
outspoken
reply
for
i
recognise
that
there
some
very
ingenious
conspiracy
afoot
somewhere
then
after
a
long
pause
during
which
he
had
his
long
clay
and
his
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
mine
the
old
man
added
you
told
me
a
little
while
ago
that
blair
had
left
you
his
secret
but
you
did
explain
to
me
the
exact
terms
of
his
will
was
anything
said
about
it
in
the
clause
which
bequeaths
it
to
me
is
a
strange
rhyme
which
runs
henry
the
eighth
was
a
knave
to
his
queens
he
one
short
of
seven
and
nine
or
ten
scenes
and
he
also
urged
me
to
preserve
the
secret
from
every
man
as
he
had
done
but
i
added
bitterly
the
secret
being
in
cipher
i
can
not
obtain
knowledge
of
it
and
have
you
no
key
smiled
the
old
seafarer
in
the
thick
reefer
none
unless
and
at
that
moment
a
strange
thought
flashed
for
the
first
time
upon
me
unless
the
key
is
actually
concealed
within
that
rhyme
i
repeated
the
couplet
aloud
yes
all
the
cards
of
that
piquet
pack
were
mentioned
in
it
king
eight
knave
queen
seven
nine
ten
my
heart
leapt
within
me
could
it
be
possible
that
by
arranging
the
cards
in
the
following
order
the
record
could
be
read
if
so
then
burton
blair
strange
secret
was
mine
at
last
i
mentioned
my
sudden
and
startling
theory
when
the
tall
old
grey
face
broadened
into
a
triumphant
grin
and
he
said
arrange
the
cards
and
try
it
chapter
twenty
the
reading
of
the
record
the
envelope
containing
the
cards
reposed
in
my
pocket
together
with
the
photograph
therefore
clearing
the
square
old
oak
table
i
opened
them
out
eagerly
while
reggie
and
the
old
man
watched
me
breathlessly
the
first
mentioned
in
the
rhyme
is
king
i
said
let
us
have
all
four
kings
together
having
arranged
them
i
placed
the
four
eights
the
four
knaves
the
queens
aces
sevens
nines
and
tens
in
the
order
given
by
the
doggerel
reggie
was
quicker
than
i
was
in
reading
down
the
first
column
and
declared
it
to
be
a
hopeless
jumble
entirely
unintelligible
i
read
for
myself
and
deeply
disappointed
was
compelled
to
admit
that
the
key
was
not
after
all
to
be
found
there
yet
i
recollected
what
my
friend
in
leicester
had
explained
how
the
record
would
be
found
in
the
first
letter
on
each
card
being
read
consecutively
from
one
to
another
through
the
whole
pack
and
tried
over
and
over
again
to
arrange
them
in
intelligible
order
but
without
any
success
the
cipher
was
just
as
tantalising
and
bewildering
as
it
had
ever
been
whole
nights
i
had
spent
with
reggie
trying
in
vain
to
make
something
of
it
but
failing
always
unable
to
make
out
one
single
word
i
transcribed
the
letters
backwards
but
the
result
upon
my
piece
of
paper
was
the
same
no
remarked
old
hales
you
have
got
hold
of
it
yet
i
sure
however
you
are
near
it
that
rhyme
gives
the
key
you
mark
me
i
honestly
believe
it
does
if
we
could
only
discover
the
proper
arrangement
i
declared
in
breathless
excitement
that
just
it
remarked
reggie
in
dismay
that
just
where
the
ingenuity
of
the
cipher
lies
it
so
very
simple
and
yet
so
extraordinarily
complicated
that
the
possible
combinations
run
into
millions
think
of
it
but
we
have
the
rhyme
which
distinctly
shows
their
arrangement
henry
the
eighth
was
a
knave
to
his
queen
he
one
short
of
seven
and
nine
or
ten
that
plain
enough
and
we
ought
of
course
to
have
seen
it
from
the
first
i
said
well
try
the
king
of
one
suit
the
eight
of
another
the
knave
of
another
and
so
on
hales
suggested
bending
with
keen
interest
over
the
faces
of
the
pigmy
cards
without
loss
of
time
i
took
his
advice
and
carefully
relaid
the
cards
in
the
manner
he
suggested
but
again
the
result
was
an
unintelligible
array
of
letters
puzzling
baffling
and
disappointing
i
recollected
what
my
expert
friend
had
told
me
and
my
heart
sank
do
you
really
know
now
the
means
by
which
the
problem
can
be
solved
i
asked
of
old
hales
being
seized
with
suspicion
that
he
was
well
aware
of
it
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
was
his
quick
response
to
me
however
it
seems
certain
that
the
rhyme
in
some
way
forms
the
key
try
another
assortment
which
what
other
can
i
try
i
asked
blankly
but
he
only
shook
his
head
reggie
with
paper
and
pencil
was
trying
to
make
the
letters
intelligible
by
the
means
i
had
several
times
tried
namely
by
substituting
a
for
b
c
for
d
and
so
on
then
he
tried
two
letters
added
three
letters
added
and
more
still
in
order
to
discover
some
key
but
like
myself
he
was
utterly
foiled
meanwhile
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
fingering
the
cards
with
increased
interest
was
i
saw
trying
to
rearrange
them
himself
by
placing
his
finger
upon
one
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
as
though
he
knew
the
proper
arrangement
and
was
reading
the
record
to
himself
was
it
possible
that
he
actually
held
the
key
to
what
we
had
displayed
and
was
learning
burton
blair
secret
while
we
remained
in
ignorance
of
it
of
a
sudden
the
wiry
old
seafarer
straightened
his
back
and
looking
at
me
exclaimed
with
a
triumphant
smile
now
look
here
greenwood
there
are
four
suites
are
there
try
them
in
alphabetical
order
that
would
be
clubs
diamonds
hearts
and
spades
first
take
all
the
clubs
and
arrange
them
king
eight
knave
queen
ace
seven
nine
ten
then
the
diamonds
and
afterwards
the
other
two
suites
then
see
what
you
make
of
it
assisted
by
reggie
i
proceeded
to
again
resort
the
cards
into
suites
and
to
arrange
them
according
to
the
rhyme
in
four
columns
of
eight
each
upon
the
table
the
suites
as
he
suggested
in
alphabetical
order
at
last
shouted
reggie
almost
beside
himself
with
joy
at
last
why
we
got
it
old
chap
look
read
the
first
letter
on
each
card
straight
down
one
after
the
other
what
do
you
make
it
spell
all
three
of
us
were
breathless
old
hales
apparently
the
most
excited
of
all
or
perhaps
he
had
been
misleading
us
and
pretending
ignorance
i
had
as
yet
only
placed
the
first
suite
the
clubs
but
they
read
as
follows

why
i
cried
staring
at

i
had
discovered

commences
yes
and
i
see
other
words
in
the
other
columns
cried
reggie
excitedly
snatching
some
of
the
cards
from
me
in
his
excitement
and
assisting
me
to
rearrange
the
other
suites
those
moments
were
among
the
most
breathless
and
exciting
of
my
life
the
great
secret
which
had
brought
burton
blair
all
his
fabulous
wealth
was
about
to
be
revealed
to
us
it
might
render
me
a
millionaire
as
it
had
already
done
its
dead
possessor
at
last
the
cards
being
all
arranged
in
their
proper
order
the
eight
diamonds
eight
hearts
and
eight
spades
beneath
the
eight
clubs
i
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
down
the
first
letter
on
each
card
yes
i
cried
almost
beside
myself
with
excitement
the
arrangement
is
perfect
blair
secret
is
revealed
why
it
some
kind
of
record
exclaimed
reggie
and
it
begins
with
the
words
the
ponte
del
diavolo
that
italian
for
the
devil
bridge
i
suppose
the
ponte
del
diavolo
is
an
old
mediaeval
bridge
near
lucca
i
explained
quickly
and
then
i
recollected
the
capuchin
who
lived
in
that
silent
monastery
close
by
but
at
that
moment
all
my
attention
was
given
to
the
transcript
of
the
cipher
and
i
had
no
time
for
reflection
the
letter
j
was
inserted
sometimes
in
place
of
a
space
apparently
in
order
to
throw
the
lettering
out
and
so
conceal
it
from
any
chance
solution
at
length
after
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
certain
of
the
faded
letters
on
the
cards
were
almost
obliterated
i
discovered
that
the
decipher
i
had
scribbled
was
a
strange
record
as
follows
between
the
ponte
del
diavolo
and
the
point
where
the
serchio
joins
the
lima
on
the
left
bank
four
hundred
and
paces
from
the
foot
of
the
bridge
where
the
sun
shines
only
one
hour
on
the
fifth
of
april
and
two
hours
on
the
fifth
of
may
at
noon
descend
behind
where
a
man
can
defend
himself
against
four
hundred
there
two
big
rocks
one
on
each
side
on
one
will
be
found
cut
the
figure
of
an
old
on
the
right
hand
go
down
and
you
will
find
what
you
seek
but
first
find
the
old
man
who
lives
at
the
crossways
i
wonder
what
it
all
means
remarked
reggie
who
turning
to
old
hales
added
the
latter
indicates
you
whereat
the
old
fellow
laughed
knowingly
and
we
saw
that
he
knew
more
of
blair
affairs
than
he
would
admit
it
means
i
said
that
some
secret
is
concealed
in
that
narrow
romantic
valley
of
the
serchio
and
these
are
the
directions
for
its
discovery
i
know
the
winding
river
where
through
ages
the
water
has
cut
deeply
down
into
a
rocky
bed
full
of
giant
boulders
and
wild
leaping
torrents
and
deep
pools
of
the
pointed
ponte
del
diavolo
are
told
many
quaint
stories
of
the
devil
building
the
bridge
and
taking
for
his
own
the
first
living
thing
to
pass
over
it
which
proved
to
be
a
dog
indeed
i
added
the
spot
is
one
of
the
wildest
and
most
romantic
in
all
rural
tuscany
strange
too
the
fra
antonio
should
live
in
the
monastery
only
three
miles
from
the
spot
indicated
who
is
fra
antonio
asked
hales
still
gazing
upon
the
cards
thoughtfully
i
explained
whereupon
the
old
fellow
smiled
and
i
felt
certain
that
he
recognised
in
the
monk
description
one
of
blair
friends
of
days
bygone
who
actually
wrote
this
record
i
inquired
of
him
it
was
not
blair
that
plain
no
was
his
reply
now
that
it
has
been
legally
left
to
you
by
our
friend
and
that
you
have
succeeded
in
deciphering
it
i
may
as
well
tell
you
something
more
concerning
it
yes
do
we
both
cried
eagerly
with
one
breath
well
it
happened
in
this
way
explained
the
thin
old
fellow
pressing
down
the
tobacco
hard
into
his
long
clay
some
years
ago
i
was
serving
as
first
mate
on
the
barque
of
liverpool
engaged
in
the
mediterranean
fruit
trade
and
running
regularly
between
naples
smyrna
barcelona
algiers
and
liverpool
our
crew
was
a
mixed
one
of
english
spaniards
and
italians
and
among
the
latter
was
an
old
fellow
named
bruno
he
was
a
mysterious
individual
from
calabria
and
among
the
crew
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
once
been
the
head
of
a
noted
band
of
brigands
who
had
terrorised
that
most
southern
portion
of
italy
and
who
had
only
recently
been
exterminated
by
the
carabineers
the
other
italians
nicknamed
him
baffitone
which
in
their
language
is
i
believe
big
moustache
he
was
a
hard
worker
drank
next
to
nothing
and
was
apparently
rather
for
he
spoke
and
wrote
english
quite
well
and
further
he
was
always
worrying
everybody
to
devise
ciphers
the
solution
of
which
he
would
set
himself
in
his
leisure
to
puzzle
out
one
day
on
a
religious
feast
made
excuse
by
the
italians
for
a
holiday
i
found
him
in
the
forecastle
writing
something
on
a
small
pack
of
cards
he
tried
to
conceal
what
he
was
doing
but
my
curiosity
aroused
i
detected
at
once
how
he
had
arranged
them
and
the
very
fact
told
me
what
a
remarkably
ingenious
cipher
he
had
discovered
the
old
man
paused
for
a
moment
as
though
he
hesitated
to
tell
us
the
whole
truth
presently
when
he
had
lit
his
pipe
with
a
spill
he
resumed
saying
i
left
the
sea
came
back
to
my
wife
here
and
for
fully
six
years
saw
nothing
of
the
italian
until
one
day
looking
well
and
prosperous
in
a
suit
of
brand
new
clothes
and
a
new
hard
hat
he
called
upon
me
he
was
still
on
the
but
she
was
in
dry
dock
and
therefore
he
was
he
said
having
a
bit
of
a
spree
ashore
he
remained
here
with
me
for
two
days
and
with
his
little
camera
evidently
a
fresh
acquisition
he
snapshotted
every
conceivable
object
including
this
house
before
he
went
away
he
took
me
into
his
confidence
and
told
me
that
what
had
been
suspected
of
him
on
board
the
was
true
that
he
was
none
other
than
the
notorious
poldo
pensi
the
brigand
whose
daring
and
ferocity
had
long
been
chronicled
in
italian
song
and
story
he
had
however
since
the
breaking
up
of
his
band
become
a
reformed
character
and
rather
than
profit
by
certain
knowledge
that
he
had
obtained
while
an
outlaw
he
worked
for
his
living
on
board
an
english
ship
the
knowledge
he
said
was
obtained
from
a
certain
cardinal
sannini
of
the
vatican
whom
he
had
held
to
ransom
and
was
of
such
a
character
that
he
might
become
a
rich
man
any
day
he
wished
but
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
government
had
offered
a
large
reward
for
his
capture
either
dead
or
alive
he
deemed
it
best
to
conceal
his
identity
and
sail
the
seas
but
he
told
me
here
in
this
room
as
we
sat
smoking
together
the
night
before
he
departed
that
the
secret
was
on
record
but
in
such
a
manner
that
any
one
discovering
it
would
not
be
able
to
read
it
without
possessing
the
key
to
the
cipher
then
he
left
it
on
these
cards
i
cried
interrupting
exactly
the
secret
of
cardinal
sannini
obtained
by
the
notorious
outlaw
poldo
pensi
whose
terrible
band
ravaged
half
italy
years
ago
and
who
compelled
pope
pius
ix
himself
to
pay
tribute
to
them
is
written
here
just
as
you
have
deciphered
it
is
this
man
pensi
dead
i
inquired
oh
yes
he
died
and
was
buried
at
sea
somewhere
off
lisbon
before
burton
blair
came
into
possession
of
the
cards
the
secret
i
ascertained
was
wrung
from
cardinal
sannini
who
while
on
his
way
across
the
wild
inhospitable
country
between
reggio
and
gerace
was
seized
by
pensi
and
his
gang
taken
up
to
their
stronghold
a
small
mountain
village
about
three
miles
from
nicastro
and
there
held
prisoner
a
large
ransom
being
about
to
be
demanded
of
the
holy
see
for
certain
reasons
it
seemed
the
wily
old
cardinal
in
question
did
not
desire
that
the
vatican
should
be
made
aware
of
his
capture
therefore
he
made
it
a
condition
of
his
release
that
he
should
reveal
a
certain
very
remarkable
secret
the
secret
written
upon
the
cards
which
he
did
and
in
exchange
for
which
pensi
released
him
but
sannini
was
one
of
the
highest
placed
cardinals
in
rome
i
exclaimed
why
at
the
death
of
pio
nono
he
was
believed
to
be
designed
as
his
successor
to
the
pontificate
true
remarked
the
old
man
who
seemed
well
versed
in
all
the
recent
history
of
peter
at
rome
the
secret
divulged
by
the
cardinal
is
undoubtedly
one
of
very
great
value
and
he
did
so
in
order
to
save
his
own
reputation
i
believe
for
from
what
the
outlaw
told
me
they
had
discovered
that
he
was
in
the
extreme
south
in
direct
opposition
to
the
pope
orders
and
in
order
to
stir
up
some
religious
against
pio
nono
hence
sannini
so
trusted
by
his
holiness
was
compelled
at
all
hazards
to
keep
the
facts
of
his
capture
an
absolute
secret
pensi
related
how
before
releasing
the
cardinal
he
went
himself
in
secret
to
a
certain
spot
in
tuscany
and
ascertained
that
what
the
great
ecclesiastic
had
divulged
was
absolutely
the
truth
he
was
then
released
and
given
safe
escort
back
to
cosenza
whence
he
took
train
back
to
rome
but
how
came
burton
blair
possessed
of
the
secret
i
inquired
eagerly
ah
remarked
the
old
fellow
showing
the
palms
of
his
hard
brown
hands
that
the
question
i
know
that
upon
these
very
cards
poldo
pensi
the
of
calabria
inscribed
the
cardinal
directions
in
english
indeed
you
will
note
that
the
wording
betrays
a
foreigner
those
faded
capital
letters
were
traced
by
him
on
board
the
and
he
certainly
held
the
secret
safely
until
his
death
what
he
told
me
i
never
divulged
until
well
until
i
was
compelled
to
by
burton
blair
on
that
night
when
he
recognised
this
house
from
photograph
and
rediscovered
me
compelled
you
reggie
exclaimed
how
chapter
twenty
one
worse
than
death
the
tall
old
fellow
looked
at
me
with
his
grey
eyes
and
shook
his
head
burton
blair
knew
rather
too
much
he
answered
evasively
he
had
it
seemed
been
raised
to
chief
mate
of
the
when
i
left
her
and
poldo
the
man
who
had
held
dukes
and
cardinals
and
other
great
men
to
ransom
worked
patiently
under
him
then
after
a
bad
go
of
fever
poldo
died
and
strangely
enough
gave
so
blair
declared
the
pack
of
cards
with
the
secret
into
his
hands
dicky
dawson
however
who
was
also
on
board
as
and
who
had
lived
half
his
life
on
italian
brigs
in
the
adriatic
declares
that
this
story
is
untrue
and
that
blair
stole
the
little
bag
containing
the
cards
from
beneath
pillow
half
an
hour
before
he
died
that
however
may
be
the
truth
or
a
lie
yet
the
facts
remain
that
poldo
must
have
let
out
some
portion
of
his
secret
in
the
delirium
of
the
fever
and
that
the
little
cards
passed
into
blair
possession
three
weeks
after
the
italian
death
blair
on
landing
at
liverpool
carrying
with
him
the
cards
and
the
photograph
set
out
on
that
very
long
and
fatiguing
journey
up
and
down
all
the
roads
in
england
in
order
to
find
me
and
learn
from
me
the
key
to
the
secret
of
the
outlaws
which
i
held
and
when
at
last
he
found
you
what
then
he
alleged
solemnly
that
bruno
had
given
it
to
him
as
a
dying
gift
and
that
his
reason
for
seeking
me
was
because
the
old
outlaw
had
before
he
died
requested
to
see
the
photograph
from
his
and
looking
upon
it
for
a
long
time
had
said
to
himself
reflectively
in
italian
lives
in
that
house
the
only
man
who
knows
my
secret
for
that
reason
blair
evidently
secured
the
picture
after
the
italian
death
on
arrival
here
he
showed
me
the
cards
and
promised
me
a
thousand
pounds
if
i
would
reveal
the
italian
confidences
as
the
man
was
dead
i
saw
no
reason
to
withhold
them
and
in
exchange
for
a
promise
to
pay
the
amount
i
told
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
among
other
matters
explained
the
rearrangement
of
the
cards
so
that
he
could
decipher
them
the
key
to
the
cipher
i
had
learnt
on
that
festival
when
i
had
discovered
poldo
writing
upon
a
pack
of
cards
a
message
evidently
intended
for
the
cardinal
himself
at
rome
for
i
have
since
established
the
fact
that
the
outlaw
and
the
ecclesiastic
were
in
frequent
but
secret
communication
prior
to
the
latter
death
but
this
man
dawson
must
have
profited
enormously
by
the
revelation
made
by
blair
i
remarked
they
seem
to
have
been
most
intimate
friends
of
course
he
profited
hales
replied
blair
possessing
this
remarkable
secret
went
in
deadly
fear
of
dicky
the
who
might
declare
as
he
had
already
done
that
he
had
stolen
it
from
the
dying
man
he
was
well
aware
that
dawson
was
an
unscrupulous
sailor
of
the
very
worst
type
therefore
he
considered
it
a
very
judicious
course
i
suppose
to
go
into
partnership
with
him
and
assist
in
the
exploration
of
the
secret
but
poor
blair
must
have
been
in
the
fellow
hands
all
through
although
it
is
plain
that
the
gains
blair
made
were
enormous
while
those
of
dicky
have
been
equal
although
it
seems
probable
that
the
latter
has
lived
in
absolute
obscurity
dawson
feared
to
come
to
england
reggie
remarked
yes
answered
the
old
man
there
was
a
rather
ugly
incident
in
liverpool
a
few
years
ago
that
the
reason
there
is
no
negative
evidence
regarding
the
actual
gift
of
the
pack
of
cards
to
blair
by
this
reformed
outlaw
is
there
i
inquired
none
whatever
for
my
own
part
i
believe
that
poldo
gave
them
to
blair
together
with
instruction
to
return
ashore
and
find
me
because
he
had
showed
him
many
little
kindnesses
during
repeated
illnesses
poldo
on
giving
up
his
evil
ways
had
become
religious
and
used
to
attend
sailors
bethels
and
missions
when
ashore
while
blair
was
as
you
know
a
very
man
for
a
sailor
when
i
recollect
all
the
circumstances
i
believe
it
was
only
natural
that
poldo
should
give
the
dead
cardinal
secret
into
the
hands
of
his
best
friend
the
spot
indicated
is
near
lucca
in
tuscany
i
remarked
you
say
that
this
outlaw
poldo
pensi
had
been
there
and
made
an
investigation
what
did
he
find
he
found
what
the
cardinal
had
told
him
he
would
find
but
he
never
explained
to
me
its
nature
all
he
would
tell
was
that
the
secret
would
render
its
possessor
a
very
wealthy
man
which
it
certainly
did
in
blair
case
the
connexion
of
the
church
between
the
late
cardinal
sannini
and
fra
antonio
the
monk
of
lucca
is
strange
i
observed
is
the
monk
i
wonder
in
possession
of
the
secret
he
certainly
had
some
connexion
with
the
affair
as
shown
by
his
constant
consultations
with
the
man
dawson
no
doubt
remarked
reggie
turning
over
the
little
cards
idly
now
got
to
discover
the
exact
position
of
both
men
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
this
fellow
dawson
from
obtaining
too
firm
a
hold
on
mabel
blair
fortune
leave
that
to
me
i
said
confidently
for
the
present
our
line
of
action
is
quite
clear
we
must
investigate
the
spot
on
the
bank
of
the
serchio
and
discover
what
is
hidden
there
then
turning
to
hales
i
added
in
the
record
it
is
i
notice
distinctly
directed
find
the
old
man
who
lives
at
the
house
by
the
crossways
what
does
that
mean
why
is
that
direction
given
because
i
suppose
that
when
the
record
was
written
upon
these
cards
i
was
the
only
other
person
having
any
knowledge
of
the
secret
the
only
person
too
possessing
the
key
to
the
cipher
but
you
affected
ignorance
of
all
this
at
first
i
said
still
viewing
the
old
fellow
with
some
suspicion
because
i
was
not
certain
of
your
he
laughed
quite
frankly
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
i
was
not
inclined
to
show
my
hand
prematurely
then
you
have
really
told
us
all
you
know
reggie
said
yes
i
know
no
more
he
replied
as
to
what
is
contained
at
the
spot
indicated
in
the
record
i
am
quite
ignorant
remember
that
blair
has
paid
me
justly
even
more
than
he
stipulated
but
as
you
are
well
aware
he
was
a
most
reserved
man
concerning
his
own
affairs
and
left
me
in
entire
ignorance
you
can
give
us
no
further
information
regarding
this
man
who
seems
to
have
been
blair
partner
in
the
extraordinary
enterprise
none
except
that
he
a
very
undesirable
acquaintance
it
was
poldo
who
nicknamed
him
ceco
and
the
monk
who
calls
himself
fra
antonio
i
know
nothing
of
him
never
heard
of
any
such
person
it
was
upon
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inquire
whether
the
old
man
had
a
son
and
if
that
son
name
was
herbert
recollecting
as
i
did
that
tragic
midnight
scene
in
mayvill
park
yet
fortunately
perhaps
i
was
prompted
to
remain
silent
preferring
to
conceal
my
knowledge
and
to
await
developments
of
the
extraordinary
situation
still
a
fierce
mad
jealousy
was
gnawing
at
my
heart
mabel
the
calm
sweet
girl
i
loved
so
well
and
whose
future
had
been
entrusted
to
me
had
like
so
many
other
girls
committed
the
grievous
error
of
falling
in
love
with
a
common
man
rough
uncouth
and
far
beneath
her
station
love
in
a
cottage
about
which
we
hear
so
much
is
all
very
well
in
theory
just
as
is
the
fallacy
but
in
these
modern
days
the
woman
habituated
to
luxury
can
never
be
happy
in
the
house
any
more
than
the
man
who
gallantly
marries
for
love
and
foregoes
his
inheritance
no
each
time
i
recollected
that
young
ruffian
sneers
and
threats
his
arrogance
and
his
final
outburst
of
murderous
passion
which
had
been
so
near
producing
a
fatal
termination
to
my
my
blood
boiled
my
anger
was
aflame
the
fellow
had
escaped
but
within
myself
i
determined
that
he
should
not
go
and
yet
when
i
recollected
it
seemed
as
though
mabel
were
utterly
and
irresistibly
in
that
man
power
even
though
she
had
attempted
defiance
we
remained
with
hales
and
his
wife
for
another
hour
learning
few
additional
facts
except
from
a
word
that
the
old
lady
let
drop
i
ascertained
that
they
actually
had
a
son
whose
name
was
herbert
but
whose
character
was
none
too
good
he
was
in
the
stables
at
belvoir
his
mother
explained
when
i
made
inquiry
of
him
but
he
left
nearly
two
years
ago
and
we
have
seen
him
since
he
writes
sometimes
from
various
places
and
appears
to
be
prospering
the
fellow
was
therefore
as
i
had
surmised
from
his
appearance
a
horsekeeper
a
groom
or
something
of
that
kind
it
was
already
seven
when
we
arrived
back
at
king
cross
and
after
a
hasty
chop
at
a
small
italian
restaurant
opposite
the
station
we
both
drove
to
grosvenor
square
in
order
to
explain
to
mabel
our
success
in
the
solution
of
the
cipher
carter
who
admitted
us
knew
us
so
well
that
he
conducted
us
straight
upstairs
to
the
great
so
artistically
lit
with
its
shaded
electric
lights
placed
cunningly
in
all
sorts
of
corners
upon
the
table
was
a
great
old
full
of
splendid
gloire
de
dijon
roses
which
the
head
gardener
sent
with
the
fruit
from
the
house
at
mayvill
daily
their
arrangement
was
i
knew
by
the
hand
of
the
woman
whom
for
years
i
had
secretly
admired
and
loved
upon
a
side
table
was
a
fine
panel
photograph
of
poor
burton
blair
in
a
heavy
silver
frame
and
upon
the
corner
his
daughter
had
placed
a
tiny
bow
of
crape
to
honour
the
dead
man
memory
the
great
house
was
full
of
those
womanly
touches
that
betrayed
the
sweet
sympathy
of
her
character
and
the
calm
tranquillity
of
her
life
presently
the
door
opened
and
we
both
rose
to
our
feet
but
instead
of
the
bright
girl
with
the
musical
voice
and
merry
open
face
there
entered
the
bearded
man
in
glasses
who
was
once
the
of
the
barque
of
liverpool
and
afterwards
had
been
the
secret
partner
of
burton
blair
good
evening
gentlemen
he
exclaimed
bowing
with
that
forced
veneer
of
polish
he
sometimes
assumed
i
am
very
pleased
to
welcome
you
here
in
my
late
friend
house
i
have
as
you
will
perceive
taken
up
my
quarters
here
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
poor
blair
will
and
i
am
pleased
to
have
this
opportunity
of
again
meeting
you
the
fellow
cool
impudence
took
us
both
entirely
aback
he
seemed
so
entirely
confident
that
his
position
was
unassailable
we
called
to
see
miss
blair
i
explained
we
were
not
aware
that
you
were
about
to
take
up
your
residence
here
quite
so
quickly
oh
it
is
best
he
assured
us
there
are
a
great
many
matters
in
connexion
with
blair
wide
interests
that
require
immediate
attention
and
as
he
was
speaking
the
door
again
opened
and
there
entered
a
woman
of
about
of
medium
height
rather
showily
dressed
in
a
black
gown
but
whose
countenance
was
of
a
rather
common
type
yet
nevertheless
somewhat
prepossessing
my
daughter
dolly
explained
the
man
allow
me
to
introduce
you
and
we
both
gave
her
rather
a
cold
bow
for
it
seemed
that
they
had
both
made
their
abode
there
and
taken
over
the
management
of
the
house
in
their
own
hands
i
suppose
percival
still
remains
i
inquired
after
a
few
moments
on
recovering
from
the
shock
at
finding
the
adventurer
and
his
daughter
were
actually
in
possession
of
that
splendid
mansion
which
half
london
admired
and
the
other
half
envied
the
place
of
which
numerous
photographs
and
descriptions
had
appeared
in
the
magazines
and
journals
yes
percival
is
still
in
her
own
i
left
her
there
five
minutes
ago
mabel
it
seems
went
out
at
eleven
this
morning
and
has
not
returned
not
returned
i
exclaimed
in
quick
surprise
why
not
percival
seems
to
be
very
upset
fears
something
has
happened
to
her
i
think
without
another
word
i
ran
down
the
broad
staircase
with
its
crystal
balustrade
and
tapping
at
the
door
of
the
room
set
apart
for
percival
and
announcing
my
identity
was
at
once
allowed
admittance
the
instant
the
prim
elderly
widow
saw
me
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
terrible
distress
crying
oh
greenwood
greenwood
what
can
we
do
how
can
we
treat
these
terrible
people
poor
mabel
left
this
morning
and
drove
in
the
brougham
to
euston
station
there
she
gave
peters
this
letter
addressed
to
you
and
then
dismissed
the
carriage
what
can
it
possibly
mean
i
took
the
note
she
handed
me
and
tremblingly
tore
it
open
to
find
a
few
hurriedly
scribbled
lines
in
pencil
upon
a
sheet
of
notepaper
as
follows
dear
greenwood
you
will
no
doubt
be
greatly
surprised
to
learn
that
i
have
left
home
for
ever
i
am
well
aware
that
you
entertain
for
me
as
high
a
regard
and
esteem
as
i
do
for
you
but
as
my
secret
must
come
out
i
can
not
remain
to
face
you
of
all
men
these
people
will
hound
me
to
death
therefore
i
prefer
to
live
in
secret
beyond
the
reach
of
their
taunts
and
their
vengeance
than
to
remain
and
have
the
finger
of
scorn
pointed
at
me
my
father
secret
can
never
become
yours
because
his
enemies
are
far
too
wily
and
ingenious
every
precaution
has
been
taken
to
secure
it
against
all
your
endeavours
therefore
as
your
friend
i
tell
you
it
is
no
use
grinding
the
wind
all
is
hopeless
exposure
means
to
me
a
fate
worse
than
death
believe
me
that
only
desperation
has
driven
me
to
this
step
because
my
poor
father
cowardly
enemies
and
mine
have
triumphed
yet
at
the
same
time
i
ask
you
to
forget
entirely
that
any
one
ever
existed
of
the
name
of
the
unhappy
and
heartbroken
mabel
blair
i
stood
with
the
open
letter
in
my
hand
absolutely
speechless
chapter
twenty
two
the
mystery
of
a
night
adventure
exposure
means
to
me
a
fate
worse
than
death
she
wrote
what
could
it
mean
percival
divined
by
my
face
the
gravity
of
the
communication
and
rising
quickly
to
her
feet
she
placed
her
hand
tenderly
upon
my
shoulder
asking
what
is
it
greenwood
may
i
not
know
for
answer
i
handed
her
the
note
she
read
it
through
quickly
then
gave
vent
to
a
loud
cry
of
dismay
realising
that
burton
daughter
had
actually
fled
that
she
held
the
man
dawson
in
fear
was
plain
she
dreaded
that
her
own
secret
whatever
it
was
must
now
be
exposed
and
had
it
seemed
fled
rather
than
again
face
me
but
why
what
could
her
secret
possibly
be
that
she
was
so
ashamed
that
she
was
bent
upon
hiding
herself
percival
summoned
the
coachman
crump
who
had
driven
his
young
mistress
to
euston
and
questioned
him
miss
mabel
ordered
the
just
before
eleven
the
man
said
saluting
she
took
her
crocodile
with
her
but
last
night
she
sent
away
a
big
trunk
by
carter
patterson
full
of
old
clothing
so
she
told
her
maid
i
drove
her
to
euston
station
where
she
alighted
and
went
into
the
she
kept
me
waiting
about
five
minutes
when
she
brought
a
porter
who
took
her
bag
and
she
then
gave
me
the
letter
addressed
to
greenwood
to
give
to
you
i
drove
home
then
she
went
to
the
north
evidently
i
remarked
when
crump
had
left
and
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
it
looks
as
though
her
flight
was
premeditated
she
sent
away
her
things
last
night
i
was
thinking
of
that
arrogant
young
stable
worker
hales
and
wondering
if
his
renewed
threats
had
really
caused
her
to
keep
another
tryst
with
him
if
so
it
was
exceedingly
dangerous
we
must
find
her
said
percival
resolutely
ah
she
sighed
i
really
do
know
what
will
happen
for
the
house
is
now
in
possession
of
this
odious
man
dawson
and
his
daughter
and
the
man
is
a
most
uncouth
fellow
he
addresses
the
servants
with
an
easy
familiarity
just
as
though
they
were
his
equals
and
just
now
he
actually
complimented
one
of
the
housemaids
upon
her
good
looks
terrible
greenwood
terrible
exclaimed
the
widow
greatly
shocked
most
disgraceful
show
of
i
certainly
can
not
remain
here
now
mabel
has
thought
fit
to
leave
without
even
consulting
me
lady
rainham
called
this
afternoon
but
of
course
i
had
to
be
not
at
home
what
can
i
tell
people
in
these
distressing
circumstances
i
saw
how
scandalised
was
the
estimable
old
chaperone
for
she
was
nothing
if
not
a
straightforward
widow
whose
very
life
depended
upon
rigorous
etiquette
and
the
traditions
of
her
honourable
family
cordial
and
affable
to
her
equals
yet
she
was
most
frigid
and
unbending
to
all
inferiors
cultivating
a
habit
of
staring
at
them
through
her
square
eyeglass
rimmed
with
gold
and
surveying
them
as
though
they
were
surprising
creatures
of
a
different
flesh
and
blood
it
was
this
latter
idiosyncrasy
which
always
annoyed
mabel
who
held
the
very
womanly
creed
that
one
should
be
kind
and
pleasant
to
inferiors
and
cold
only
to
enemies
nevertheless
under
percival
protective
wing
and
active
tuition
mabel
herself
had
gone
into
the
best
circle
of
society
whose
doors
are
ever
open
to
the
daughter
of
the
millionaire
and
had
established
a
reputation
as
one
of
the
most
charming
of
her
season
how
society
has
altered
in
these
past
ten
years
nowadays
the
golden
key
is
the
open
sesame
of
the
doors
of
the
bluest
blood
in
england
the
old
exclusive
circles
are
no
longer
or
if
there
are
any
they
are
obscure
and
dowdy
ladies
go
to
music
halls
and
glorified
what
used
to
be
regarded
as
the
drawback
from
the
dinner
at
a
restaurant
is
now
a
principal
attraction
a
gentlewoman
a
generation
ago
reasonably
objected
that
she
did
not
know
whom
she
might
sit
next
now
as
was
the
case
at
the
theatre
in
the
days
the
loose
character
of
a
portion
of
the
visitors
constitutes
in
itself
a
lure
the
more
flagrant
the
scandal
concerning
some
bedizened
impropriety
the
greater
the
inducement
to
dine
in
her
company
and
if
possible
in
her
vicinity
of
such
is
the
tone
and
trend
of
london
society
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
reggie
was
engaged
with
dawson
et
i
took
counsel
with
the
widow
endeavouring
to
form
some
idea
of
where
mabel
had
concealed
herself
percival
idea
was
that
she
would
reveal
her
whereabouts
ere
long
but
knowing
her
firmness
of
character
as
well
as
i
did
i
held
a
different
opinion
her
letter
was
one
of
a
woman
who
had
made
a
resolve
and
meant
at
all
hazards
to
keep
it
she
feared
to
meet
me
and
for
that
reason
would
no
doubt
conceal
her
identity
she
had
a
separate
account
at
coutts
in
her
own
name
therefore
she
would
not
be
compelled
to
reveal
her
whereabouts
through
want
of
funds
ford
the
dead
man
secretary
a
tall
athletic
man
of
thirty
put
his
head
into
the
room
but
finding
us
talking
at
once
withdrew
percival
had
already
questioned
him
she
said
but
he
was
entirely
unaware
of
mabel
destination
the
man
dawson
had
now
usurped
ford
position
in
the
household
and
the
latter
full
of
resentment
was
on
the
constant
watch
and
as
full
of
suspicion
as
we
all
were
reggie
rejoined
me
presently
saying
that
fellow
is
absolutely
a
bounder
of
the
very
first
water
actually
invited
me
to
have
a
in
blair
house
too
he
treating
mabel
flight
as
a
huge
joke
saying
that
she
be
back
quickly
enough
and
adding
that
she
ca
afford
to
be
away
long
and
that
he
bring
her
back
the
very
instant
he
desires
her
presence
here
in
fact
the
fellow
talks
just
as
though
she
were
as
wax
in
his
hands
and
as
if
he
can
do
anything
he
pleases
with
her
he
can
ruin
her
financially
that
certain
i
remarked
sighing
but
read
this
old
chap
and
i
gave
him
her
letter
good
heavens
he
gasped
when
he
glanced
at
it
she
in
deadly
terror
of
those
people
that
very
certain
it
to
avoid
them
and
you
that
she
escaped
to
liverpool
and
america
perhaps
remember
been
a
great
traveller
all
her
youth
and
therefore
knows
her
way
about
we
must
find
her
reggie
i
declared
decisively
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
she
bent
on
avoiding
you
he
said
she
has
some
distinct
reason
for
this
it
seems
a
reason
known
only
to
herself
i
remarked
pensively
it
is
surely
a
that
now
just
at
the
moment
when
we
have
gained
the
truth
of
the
cardinal
secret
which
brought
blair
his
fortune
mabel
should
voluntarily
disappear
in
this
manner
recollect
all
we
have
at
stake
we
know
not
who
are
our
friends
or
who
our
enemies
we
ought
both
to
go
out
to
italy
and
discover
the
spot
indicated
in
that
cipher
record
or
others
will
probably
forestall
us
and
we
may
then
be
too
late
he
agreed
that
the
record
being
bequeathed
to
me
i
ought
to
take
immediate
steps
to
establish
my
claim
to
it
whatever
might
be
we
could
not
disguise
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
dawson
as
partner
and
participator
of
his
enormous
wealth
must
be
well
aware
of
the
secret
and
that
he
had
already
most
probably
taken
steps
to
conceal
the
truth
from
myself
the
rightful
owner
he
was
a
power
to
be
reckoned
with
a
sinister
person
possessed
of
the
wiliest
cunning
and
the
most
devilish
ingenuity
in
the
art
of
subterfuge
report
everywhere
gave
him
that
character
he
possessed
the
cold
calm
manner
of
the
man
who
had
lived
by
his
wits
and
it
seemed
that
in
this
affair
his
ingenuity
sharpened
by
a
life
of
adventure
was
to
be
pitted
against
my
own
mabel
sudden
resolution
and
disappearance
were
maddening
the
mystery
of
her
letter
too
was
inscrutable
if
she
were
really
dreading
lest
some
undesirable
fact
might
be
exposed
then
she
ought
to
have
trusted
me
sufficiently
to
take
me
entirely
into
her
confidence
i
loved
her
although
i
had
never
declared
my
passion
therefore
ignorant
of
the
truth
she
had
treated
me
as
i
had
desired
as
a
sincere
friend
yet
why
had
she
not
sought
my
aid
women
are
such
strange
creatures
i
reflected
perhaps
she
loved
that
fellow
after
all
a
fevered
anxious
week
went
by
and
mabel
made
no
sign
one
night
i
left
reggie
at
the
devonshire
about
eleven
and
walked
the
damp
foggy
london
streets
until
the
roar
of
traffic
died
away
the
cabs
crawled
and
grew
infrequent
and
the
damp
muddy
pavements
were
given
over
to
the
tramping
constable
and
the
shivering
outcast
in
the
thick
mist
i
wandered
onward
thinking
deeply
yet
more
and
more
mystified
at
the
remarkable
chain
of
circumstances
which
seemed
hour
by
hour
to
become
more
entangled
on
and
on
i
had
wandered
heedless
of
where
my
footsteps
carried
me
passing
along
knightsbridge
skirting
the
park
and
kensington
gardens
and
was
just
passing
the
corner
of
the
earl
court
road
when
some
fortunate
circumstance
awakened
me
from
my
deep
reverie
and
i
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
being
followed
yes
there
distinctly
was
a
footstep
behind
me
hurrying
when
i
hurried
slackening
when
i
slackened
i
crossed
the
road
and
before
the
long
high
wall
of
holland
park
i
halted
and
turned
my
pursuer
came
on
a
few
paces
but
drew
up
suddenly
and
i
could
only
distinguish
against
the
glimmer
of
the
street
lamp
through
the
london
fog
a
figure
long
and
distorted
by
the
bewildering
mist
the
latter
was
not
sufficiently
dense
to
prevent
me
finding
my
way
for
i
knew
that
part
of
london
well
nevertheless
to
be
followed
so
persistently
at
such
an
hour
was
not
very
pleasant
i
was
suspicious
that
some
tramp
or
thief
who
had
passed
me
by
and
found
me
oblivious
to
my
surroundings
had
turned
and
followed
me
with
evil
intent
forward
i
went
again
but
as
soon
as
i
had
done
so
the
light
even
tread
almost
an
echo
of
my
own
came
on
steadily
behind
me
i
had
heard
weird
stories
of
madmen
who
haunt
the
london
streets
at
night
and
who
follow
unsuspecting
aimlessly
it
is
one
of
the
forms
of
insanity
well
known
to
specialists
again
i
recrossed
the
road
passing
through
edwarde
square
and
out
into
earl
court
road
thus
retracing
my
steps
back
towards
the
high
street
but
the
mysterious
man
still
followed
me
so
persistently
that
in
the
mist
which
in
that
part
had
grown
thicker
until
it
obscured
the
street
lamps
i
confess
i
experienced
some
uneasiness
presently
however
just
as
i
was
turning
the
corner
into
lexham
gardens
at
a
point
where
the
fog
had
obscured
everything
i
felt
a
sudden
rush
and
at
the
same
instant
experienced
a
sharp
stinging
sensation
behind
the
right
shoulder
the
shock
was
such
a
severe
one
that
i
cried
out
turning
next
instant
upon
my
assailant
but
so
agile
was
he
that
ere
i
could
face
him
he
had
eluded
me
and
escaped
i
heard
his
receding
footsteps
for
he
was
running
away
down
the
court
road
and
shouted
for
the
police
but
there
was
no
response
the
pain
in
my
shoulder
became
excruciating
the
unknown
man
had
struck
me
with
a
knife
and
blood
was
flowing
for
i
felt
it
damp
and
sticky
upon
my
hand
again
i
shouted
police
police
until
at
last
i
heard
an
answering
voice
in
the
mist
and
walked
in
its
direction
after
several
further
shouts
i
discovered
the
constable
and
to
him
related
my
strange
experience
he
held
his
bull
eye
close
to
my
back
and
said
yes
there
no
doubt
sir
you
been
stabbed
what
kind
of
a
man
was
he
i
never
saw
him
was
my
lame
reply
he
always
kept
at
a
distance
from
me
and
only
approached
at
a
point
where
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
his
features
i
seen
no
one
except
a
clergyman
whom
i
met
a
moment
ago
passing
in
earl
court
road
at
least
he
wore
a
hat
like
a
clergyman
i
did
see
his
face
a
clergyman
i
gasped
do
you
think
it
could
have
been
a
roman
catholic
priest
for
my
thoughts
were
at
that
moment
of
fra
antonio
who
was
evidently
the
guardian
of
the
cardinal
secret
ah
i
sure
i
could
tell
i
could
see
his
features
i
only
noted
his
hat
i
feel
very
faint
i
said
as
a
sickening
dizziness
crept
over
me
i
wish
you
get
me
a
cab
i
think
i
had
better
go
straight
home
to
great
russell
street
that
a
long
way
had
you
better
go
round
to
the
west
london
hospital
first
the
policeman
suggested
no
i
decided
i
go
home
and
call
my
own
doctor
then
i
sat
upon
a
doorstep
at
the
end
of
lexham
gardens
and
waited
while
the
constable
went
in
search
of
a
hansom
in
the
old
brompton
road
had
i
been
attacked
by
some
homicidal
maniac
who
had
followed
me
all
that
distance
or
had
i
narrowly
escaped
being
the
victim
of
foul
assassination
to
me
the
latter
theory
seemed
decidedly
the
most
feasible
there
was
a
strong
motive
for
my
death
blair
had
bequeathed
the
great
secret
to
me
and
i
had
now
learnt
the
cipher
of
the
cards
this
fact
had
probably
become
known
to
our
enemies
and
hence
their
dastardly
attempt
such
a
contingency
however
was
a
startling
one
for
if
it
had
become
known
that
i
had
really
deciphered
the
record
then
our
enemies
would
most
certainly
take
steps
in
italy
to
prevent
us
discovering
the
secret
of
that
spot
on
the
banks
of
the
wild
and
winding
serchio
at
last
the
cab
came
and
slipping
a
tip
into
the
constable
palm
i
got
in
and
with
my
silk
muffler
placed
at
my
back
to
staunch
the
blood
drove
slowly
on
through
the
fog
at
little
more
than
almost
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
hansom
i
felt
my
head
swimming
and
a
strange
sensation
of
numbness
creeping
up
my
legs
a
curious
nausea
seized
me
too
and
although
i
had
fortunately
been
able
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
which
tended
to
prove
that
the
wound
was
not
such
a
serious
one
after
all
my
hands
felt
strangely
cramped
and
in
my
jaws
was
a
curious
pain
very
much
like
the
commencement
of
an
attack
of
neuralgia
i
felt
terribly
ill
the
cabman
informed
by
the
constable
of
my
injury
opened
the
in
the
roof
to
inquire
after
me
but
i
could
scarcely
articulate
a
reply
if
the
wound
was
only
a
superficial
one
it
certainly
had
a
strange
effect
upon
me
of
the
many
misty
lights
at
hyde
park
corner
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
but
after
that
my
senses
seemed
bewildered
by
the
fog
and
the
pain
i
suffered
and
i
recollect
nothing
more
until
when
i
opened
my
eyes
painfully
again
i
found
myself
in
my
own
bed
the
daylight
shining
in
at
the
window
and
reggie
and
our
old
friend
tom
walker
surgeon
of
queen
anne
street
standing
beside
me
watching
me
with
a
serious
gravity
that
struck
me
at
the
moment
as
rather
humorous
nevertheless
i
must
admit
that
there
was
very
little
humour
in
the
situation
chapter
twenty
three
which
is
in
many
ways
amazing
walker
was
puzzled
distinctly
puzzled
he
had
i
found
strapped
up
my
wound
during
my
unconsciousness
after
probing
it
and
injecting
various
antiseptics
i
suppose
he
had
also
called
in
consultation
sir
charles
hoare
the
very
distinguished
surgeon
of
charing
cross
hospital
and
both
of
them
had
been
greatly
puzzled
over
my
symptoms
when
an
hour
later
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
able
to
talk
walker
held
my
wrist
and
asked
me
how
it
all
happened
after
i
had
explained
as
well
as
i
could
he
said
well
my
dear
fellow
i
can
only
say
you
been
about
as
near
to
death
as
any
man
i
ever
attended
it
was
just
a
case
of
touch
and
go
with
you
when
seton
first
called
me
and
i
saw
you
i
feared
that
it
was
all
up
your
wound
is
quite
a
small
one
superficial
really
and
yet
your
collapsed
condition
has
been
most
extraordinary
and
there
are
certain
symptoms
so
mysterious
that
they
have
puzzled
both
sir
charles
and
myself
what
did
the
fellow
use
not
an
ordinary
knife
certainly
it
was
evidently
a
long
dagger
a
stiletto
most
probably
i
found
outside
the
wound
upon
the
cloth
of
your
overcoat
some
grease
like
animal
fat
i
am
having
a
portion
of
it
analysed
and
do
you
know
what
i
expect
to
find
in
it
no
what
poison
was
his
reply
sir
charles
agrees
with
me
in
the
theory
that
you
were
struck
with
one
of
those
small
antique
poignards
with
perforated
blades
used
so
frequently
in
italy
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
italy
i
cried
the
very
name
of
that
country
arousing
within
me
suspicion
of
an
attempt
upon
me
by
dawson
or
by
his
close
friend
the
monk
of
lucca
yes
sir
charles
who
as
you
probably
know
possesses
a
large
collection
of
ancient
arms
tells
me
that
in
mediaeval
florence
they
used
to
impregnate
animal
fat
with
some
very
potent
poison
and
then
rub
it
upon
the
perforated
blade
on
striking
a
victim
the
act
of
withdrawing
the
blade
from
the
wound
left
a
portion
of
the
envenomed
grease
within
which
of
course
produced
a
fatal
effect
but
you
surely
do
anticipate
that
i
poisoned
i
gasped
certainly
you
are
poisoned
your
wound
would
neither
account
for
your
long
insensibility
nor
for
the
strange
livid
marks
upon
your
body
look
at
the
backs
of
your
hands
i
looked
as
he
directed
and
was
horrified
to
find
upon
each
small
dark
marks
which
also
covered
my
wrists
and
arms
do
be
too
alarmed
greenwood
the
doctor
laughed
you
turned
the
corner
and
you
not
going
to
die
yet
you
had
a
narrow
squeak
of
it
and
certainly
the
weapon
with
which
you
were
struck
was
as
deadly
as
any
that
could
be
devised
but
fortunately
you
had
a
thick
overcoat
on
besides
other
heavy
clothing
vests
and
things
all
of
which
removed
the
greater
part
of
the
venomous
substance
before
it
could
enter
the
flesh
and
a
lucky
thing
it
was
for
you
i
can
tell
you
had
you
been
attacked
like
this
in
summer
you
have
stood
no
chance
but
who
did
it
i
exclaimed
bewildered
my
eyes
riveted
upon
those
ugly
marks
upon
my
skin
the
evidence
that
some
deadly
poison
was
at
work
within
my
system
somebody
who
owed
you
a
very
grudge
i
should
fancy
laughed
the
surgeon
who
had
been
my
friend
for
many
years
and
who
used
sometimes
to
come
out
hunting
with
the
fitzwilliams
but
cheer
up
old
chap
you
have
to
live
on
milk
and
for
a
day
or
two
have
jour
wound
dressed
and
keep
very
quiet
and
you
soon
be
bobbing
about
again
that
all
very
well
i
replied
impatiently
but
i
got
a
host
of
things
to
do
some
private
matters
to
attend
to
then
you
have
to
let
them
slide
for
a
day
or
two
that
very
certain
yes
urged
reggie
you
must
really
keep
quiet
gilbert
i
only
thankful
that
it
is
so
serious
as
we
at
first
expected
when
the
cabman
brought
you
home
and
glave
tore
out
for
walker
i
really
thought
you
die
before
he
arrived
i
could
feel
any
palpitation
of
your
heart
and
you
were
cold
as
ice
i
wonder
who
was
the
brute
who
struck
me
i
cried
great
jacob
if
i
have
caught
the
fellow
i
have
wrung
his
precious
neck
there
and
then
what
the
use
of
worrying
so
long
as
you
get
better
quickly
reggie
asked
philosophically
but
i
was
silent
reflecting
that
in
the
belief
of
sir
charles
hoare
an
old
florentine
poison
dagger
had
been
used
the
very
fact
caused
me
to
suspect
that
the
dastardly
attack
had
been
made
upon
me
by
my
enemies
we
of
course
told
walker
nothing
of
our
curious
quest
for
the
present
regarding
the
affair
as
strictly
confidential
therefore
he
treated
my
injury
lightly
declaring
that
i
should
quickly
recover
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
patience
after
he
had
left
shortly
before
midday
reggie
sat
at
my
bedside
and
gravely
discussed
the
situation
the
two
most
pressing
points
at
that
moment
were
first
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
my
and
secondly
to
go
out
to
italy
and
investigate
the
cardinal
secret
the
days
passed
long
weary
gloomy
days
of
early
spring
during
which
i
tossed
in
bed
impatient
and
helpless
i
longed
to
be
up
and
active
but
walker
forbade
it
he
brought
me
books
and
papers
instead
and
enjoined
quiet
and
perfect
rest
although
reggie
and
i
still
had
our
little
hunting
box
down
at
helpstone
we
had
not
since
blair
death
been
down
there
besides
the
season
in
the
lace
trade
was
an
unusually
busy
one
and
reggie
now
seemed
tied
to
his
more
than
ever
so
i
was
left
alone
the
greater
part
of
the
day
with
glave
to
attend
to
my
wants
and
with
one
or
two
male
friends
who
now
and
then
looked
in
to
smoke
and
chat
thus
passed
the
month
of
march
my
progress
being
much
slower
than
walker
had
at
first
anticipated
on
analysis
a
very
dangerous
irritant
poison
had
been
discovered
mixed
with
the
grease
and
it
appeared
that
i
had
absorbed
more
of
it
into
my
system
than
was
at
first
believed
hence
my
tardy
recovery
percival
who
at
our
urgent
request
still
remained
at
grosvenor
square
visited
me
sometimes
bringing
me
fruit
and
flowers
from
the
hothouses
at
mayvill
but
she
had
nothing
to
report
concerning
mabel
the
latter
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
though
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
her
she
was
anxious
to
leave
blair
house
now
that
it
was
occupied
by
the
usurpers
but
we
had
cajoled
her
into
remaining
in
order
to
keep
some
check
upon
the
movements
of
the
man
dawson
and
his
daughter
ford
had
been
so
exasperated
at
the
man
manner
that
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
new
he
had
remonstrated
whereupon
dawson
had
calmly
placed
a
year
wages
in
banknotes
in
an
envelope
and
at
once
dispensed
with
his
further
services
as
of
course
he
had
intended
to
do
all
along
the
confidential
secretary
was
however
assisting
us
and
at
that
moment
was
making
every
inquiry
possible
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
his
young
mistress
the
house
is
absolutely
declared
percival
one
day
as
she
sat
with
me
the
servants
are
in
revolt
and
poor
noble
the
housekeeper
is
having
a
most
terrible
time
carter
and
eight
of
the
other
servants
gave
notice
yesterday
this
person
dawson
represents
the
very
acme
of
bad
manners
and
bad
breeding
yet
i
overheard
him
remarking
to
his
daughter
two
days
ago
that
he
actually
contemplated
putting
up
for
the
reform
and
entering
parliament
ah
what
would
poor
mabel
say
if
she
knew
the
girl
dolly
as
he
calls
her
the
common
little
wench
has
established
herself
in
mabel
boudoir
and
is
about
to
have
it
in
daffodil
yellow
to
suit
her
complexion
i
believe
while
as
for
finances
it
seems
from
what
leighton
says
that
poor
blair
fortune
must
go
entirely
through
the
fellow
hands
it
a
shame
an
abominable
shame
i
cried
angrily
we
know
that
the
man
is
an
adventurer
and
yet
we
are
utterly
powerless
i
added
bitterly
poor
mabel
sighed
the
widow
who
was
really
much
devoted
to
her
do
you
know
greenwood
she
said
with
a
sudden
air
of
confidence
i
have
thought
more
than
once
since
her
father
death
that
she
is
in
possession
of
the
truth
of
the
strange
connexion
between
her
father
and
this
unscrupulous
man
who
has
been
given
such
power
over
her
and
hers
indeed
she
has
confessed
to
me
as
much
and
i
believe
that
if
she
would
but
tell
us
the
truth
we
might
be
able
to
get
rid
of
this
terrible
incubus
why
does
she
do
it
to
save
herself
because
she
is
now
in
fear
of
him
i
answered
in
a
hard
despairing
voice
she
holds
some
secret
of
which
she
lives
in
terror
that
i
believe
accounts
for
the
sudden
manner
in
which
she
has
left
her
own
roof
and
disappeared
she
has
left
the
fellow
in
undisputed
possession
of
everything
i
had
not
forgotten
dawson
arrogance
and
on
the
night
he
had
first
called
upon
us
but
now
greenwood
will
you
please
excuse
me
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
asked
percival
settling
her
skirts
after
a
brief
pause
and
looking
straight
into
my
face
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
enter
into
your
more
private
matters
in
this
manner
but
i
trust
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
reflect
that
i
am
only
speaking
on
the
poor
behalf
well
i
inquired
somewhat
surprised
at
her
sudden
change
of
manner
usually
she
was
haughty
and
frigid
in
the
extreme
a
scathing
critic
who
had
the
names
of
everybody
cousins
aunts
and
nephews
at
her
ends
the
fact
is
this
she
went
on
you
might
i
feel
confident
induce
her
to
tell
us
the
truth
you
are
the
only
person
who
possesses
any
influence
with
her
now
that
her
father
in
dead
and
permit
me
to
say
so
i
have
reason
for
knowing
that
she
entertains
a
very
strong
regard
for
you
yes
i
remarked
unable
to
restrain
a
sigh
we
are
friends
good
friends
more
declared
percival
mabel
loves
you
loves
me
i
cried
starting
up
and
supporting
myself
upon
one
elbow
no
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
she
regards
me
more
as
a
brother
than
a
lover
and
she
has
i
think
learnt
ever
since
the
first
day
we
met
in
such
romantic
conditions
to
regard
me
in
the
light
of
a
protector
no
i
added
shaking
my
head
there
are
certain
barriers
that
must
prevent
her
loving
me
the
difference
of
our
ages
of
position
and
all
that
ah
there
you
are
entirely
mistaken
said
the
widow
quite
frankly
i
happen
to
know
that
the
very
reason
why
her
father
left
his
secret
to
you
was
in
order
that
you
might
profit
by
its
knowledge
as
he
had
done
and
because
he
foresaw
the
direction
of
mabel
affections
how
do
you
know
this
mrs
percival
i
demanded
half
inclined
to
doubt
her
because
blair
before
making
his
will
took
me
into
his
confidence
and
asked
me
frankly
whether
his
daughter
had
ever
mentioned
you
in
such
a
manner
as
to
cause
me
to
suspect
i
told
him
the
truth
of
course
just
as
i
have
now
told
you
mabel
loves
you
loves
you
very
dearly
then
for
the
legacy
left
me
by
poor
blair
i
am
in
a
great
measure
indebted
to
you
i
remarked
adding
a
word
of
thanks
and
pondering
deeply
over
the
revelation
she
had
just
made
i
only
did
what
was
my
duty
to
you
both
was
her
response
she
loves
you
as
i
say
and
therefore
by
a
little
persuasion
you
could
i
feel
convinced
induce
her
to
tell
us
the
truth
concerning
this
man
dawson
she
has
fled
it
is
true
but
more
in
fear
of
what
you
may
think
of
her
when
her
secret
is
out
than
of
the
man
himself
recollect
she
added
mabel
is
passionately
fond
of
you
she
has
confessed
it
to
me
many
times
but
for
some
extraordinary
reason
which
remains
a
mystery
she
is
endeavouring
to
repress
her
affection
she
fears
i
think
that
on
your
part
there
is
only
friendship
that
you
are
too
confirmed
a
bachelor
to
regard
her
with
any
thoughts
of
affection
oh
mrs
percival
i
cried
with
a
sudden
outpouring
i
tell
you
i
confess
to
you
that
i
have
loved
mabel
all
along
i
love
her
now
fondly
passionately
with
all
that
fierce
ardour
that
comes
to
a
man
only
once
in
his
lifetime
she
has
misjudged
me
it
is
i
who
have
been
foolishly
at
fault
for
i
have
been
blind
i
have
never
read
her
secret
then
she
must
know
this
at
once
was
the
elderly
woman
sympathetic
answer
we
must
discover
her
at
all
costs
and
tell
her
there
must
be
a
reunion
and
she
on
her
part
must
confess
to
you
i
know
too
well
how
deeply
she
loves
you
she
added
i
know
how
she
admires
you
and
how
in
the
secrecy
of
her
room
she
has
time
after
time
wept
long
and
bitterly
because
she
believed
you
were
cold
and
blind
to
the
burning
passion
of
her
true
pure
heart
but
how
the
whereabouts
of
my
were
unknown
she
had
disappeared
completely
in
order
it
seemed
to
escape
some
terrible
revelation
which
she
knew
must
be
made
sooner
or
later
in
the
days
that
followed
while
i
lay
still
weak
and
helpless
both
ford
and
reggie
were
active
in
their
inquiries
but
all
in
vain
i
called
in
the
solicitor
leighton
in
consultation
but
he
could
devise
no
plan
other
than
to
advertise
yet
to
do
so
was
we
agreed
scarcely
fair
to
her
curiously
enough
the
young
woman
dorothy
dawson
otherwise
dolly
also
betrayed
the
keenest
anxiety
for
mabel
welfare
her
mother
was
italian
and
she
spoke
english
with
a
slight
accent
having
always
she
said
lived
in
italy
indeed
she
called
upon
me
once
to
express
her
regret
at
my
illness
and
i
found
that
she
really
improved
on
acquaintance
her
apparent
coarseness
was
only
on
account
of
her
mixed
nationality
and
although
she
was
a
shrewd
young
person
possessed
of
all
the
subtle
italian
cunning
reggie
i
think
found
her
a
bright
and
amusing
companion
all
my
thoughts
were
however
of
my
sweet
lost
love
and
of
that
common
arrogant
fellow
who
by
his
threats
and
taunts
held
her
so
irresistibly
and
secretly
in
his
power
why
had
she
fled
in
terror
from
me
and
why
had
such
a
dastardly
and
ingenious
attempt
been
made
to
kill
me
i
had
solved
the
secret
of
the
cipher
only
to
be
plunged
still
deeper
into
the
mazes
of
doubt
despair
and
mystery
for
what
the
closed
book
of
the
future
held
for
me
was
as
you
will
see
truly
startling
and
bewildering
the
truth
when
revealed
was
hard
solid
fact
and
yet
so
strange
and
amazing
was
it
that
it
staggered
all
belief
chapter
twenty
four
contains
a
terrible
disclosure
many
long
and
dreary
weeks
had
passed
before
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
leave
the
house
and
accompanied
by
reggie
take
my
first
drive
it
was
mid
april
the
weather
was
still
cold
and
gay
london
had
not
yet
returned
from
wintering
in
monte
carlo
cairo
or
rome
each
year
the
society
swallows
those
people
who
fly
south
with
the
first
chill
day
of
autumn
return
to
town
later
and
each
london
season
appears
to
be
more
protracted
than
before
we
drove
down
piccadilly
to
hyde
park
corner
and
then
turning
along
constitution
hill
drove
along
the
mall
here
a
great
desire
seized
me
to
rest
for
a
brief
while
and
enjoy
the
air
in
james
park
therefore
we
alighted
paid
the
cabman
and
leaning
upon
reggie
arm
i
strolled
slowly
along
the
gravelled
walks
until
we
found
a
convenient
seat
the
glories
of
james
park
even
on
an
april
day
are
a
joy
for
ever
to
the
true
londoners
i
often
wonder
that
so
few
people
take
advantage
of
them
the
wondrous
trees
the
delicious
sheet
of
water
all
the
beauties
of
english
rural
scenery
and
then
the
sense
that
all
around
you
are
the
great
palaces
and
departments
and
offices
in
which
the
government
of
our
great
empire
is
carried
on
in
other
words
that
commingling
of
silence
at
the
core
of
feverish
and
tumultuous
life
outside
all
these
make
james
park
one
of
the
loveliest
retreats
in
england
these
things
reggie
and
i
repeated
to
each
other
and
then
under
the
soothing
influence
of
the
surroundings
there
came
musings
and
reminiscences
and
the
long
silences
which
come
between
friends
and
are
the
best
symbols
of
their
complete
accord
of
feeling
and
opinion
while
we
were
thus
seated
i
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
we
were
in
the
spot
above
all
others
where
one
was
certain
to
see
pass
at
that
time
of
day
most
of
the
prominent
political
figures
of
the
hour
on
their
way
to
their
various
departments
or
to
parliament
where
the
sitting
was
just
commencing
a
cabinet
minister
two
liberal
peers
a
conservative
whip
and
an
passed
in
rapid
succession
away
in
the
direction
of
storey
gate
reggie
who
took
a
great
interest
in
politics
and
had
often
occupied
a
seat
in
the
strangers
gallery
was
pointing
out
to
me
the
politicians
who
passed
but
my
thoughts
were
elsewhere
with
my
lost
love
now
that
percival
had
revealed
to
me
the
truth
of
mabel
affection
i
saw
how
foolish
i
had
been
in
making
pretence
of
a
coldness
towards
her
that
was
the
very
opposite
to
the
feeling
which
really
existed
in
my
heart
i
had
been
a
fool
and
had
now
to
suffer
during
the
weeks
i
had
been
confined
to
my
room
i
had
obtained
a
quantity
of
books
and
discovered
certain
facts
concerning
the
late
cardinal
who
had
divulged
the
secret
whatever
it
was
in
return
for
his
release
it
appeared
that
andrea
sannini
was
a
native
of
perugia
who
became
archbishop
of
bologna
and
was
afterwards
given
the
hat
a
great
favourite
of
pius
ix
he
was
employed
by
him
upon
many
delicate
missions
to
the
various
powers
as
a
diplomatist
he
proved
himself
possessed
of
remarkable
acumen
therefore
the
pope
appointed
him
as
well
as
director
of
the
museums
and
galleries
of
the
vatican
he
was
it
appeared
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
distinguished
figures
in
the
college
of
cardinals
and
became
extremely
prominent
for
the
part
he
played
on
the
occasion
of
the
entry
of
the
italian
troops
into
the
eternal
city
in
while
on
the
death
of
pius
ix
eight
years
later
he
was
believed
to
be
designated
as
his
successor
although
on
election
the
choice
fell
upon
his
colleague
the
late
cardinal
pecci
who
became
leo
xiii
i
was
reflecting
upon
these
facts
which
i
had
established
after
a
good
deal
of
heavy
reading
when
reggie
suddenly
cried
in
a
low
voice
why
look
there
dawson
daughter
walking
with
a
man
i
glanced
quickly
in
the
direction
indicated
and
saw
crossing
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
lake
and
approaching
in
our
direction
a
female
figure
in
a
smart
jacket
of
caracul
and
neat
toque
accompanied
by
a
tall
thin
man
in
black
dolly
dawson
was
walking
at
his
side
leisurely
chatting
and
laughing
while
he
ever
and
anon
bent
towards
her
making
some
remarks
as
he
raised
his
head
to
glance
across
the
water
i
saw
that
above
his
overcoat
showed
a
clerical
collar
with
a
tiny
piece
of
roman
purple
the
man
was
evidently
a
canon
or
other
dignitary
of
the
catholic
church
he
was
about
and
wore
a
silk
hat
of
a
somewhat
ecclesiastical
shape
a
rather
man
in
spite
of
his
thin
sensitive
lips
and
pale
ascetic
face
in
an
instant
it
struck
me
that
they
had
met
clandestinely
and
were
sauntering
there
in
order
to
avoid
possible
recognition
if
they
walked
the
streets
the
old
priest
appeared
to
be
treating
her
with
studied
politeness
and
as
i
watched
him
i
saw
from
his
slight
gesticulations
as
he
spoke
that
he
was
no
doubt
a
foreigner
i
pointed
out
the
fact
to
reggie
who
said
we
must
watch
them
old
chap
they
must
see
us
here
i
only
hope
they
turn
off
the
other
way
for
a
moment
we
followed
them
with
our
eyes
fearing
that
having
crossed
the
bridge
they
would
turn
in
our
direction
but
fortunately
they
did
not
but
turned
off
to
the
right
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
if
he
really
is
italian
then
he
may
have
come
specially
from
italy
to
have
an
interview
with
her
i
remarked
for
ever
since
i
had
met
the
monk
antonio
there
had
seemed
some
curious
connexion
between
the
secret
of
the
dead
cardinal
and
the
church
of
rome
we
must
try
and
find
out
declared
reggie
you
must
remain
here
it
getting
too
cold
for
you
he
added
springing
to
his
feet
follow
them
while
you
return
home
no
i
said
i
walk
with
you
for
a
bit
i
interested
in
the
little
game
and
rising
also
i
linked
my
arm
in
his
and
went
forward
by
the
aid
of
my
stick
they
were
walking
side
by
side
in
earnest
conversation
i
could
tell
by
the
priest
quick
gesticulations
the
way
in
which
he
first
waved
his
closed
fingers
and
then
raised
his
open
hand
and
touched
his
left
forearm
that
he
was
speaking
of
some
secret
and
the
possessor
of
it
who
had
disappeared
if
one
knows
the
italian
well
one
can
follow
in
a
sense
the
topic
of
conversation
by
the
gestures
each
one
having
its
particular
signification
hurrying
as
well
as
i
could
we
gradually
gained
upon
them
for
presently
they
slackened
their
pace
while
the
priest
spoke
earnestly
as
though
persuading
the
daughter
of
the
of
the
to
act
in
some
way
he
was
directing
she
seemed
silent
thoughtful
and
undecided
once
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
from
him
as
though
in
defiance
when
in
a
moment
the
wily
cleric
became
all
smiles
and
apologies
they
were
talking
in
italian
without
a
doubt
so
as
might
not
understand
their
conversation
his
clothes
too
i
noticed
were
of
a
distinctly
foreign
cut
and
he
wore
low
shoes
the
bright
steel
buckles
of
which
he
had
evidently
taken
off
as
they
had
come
across
the
bridge
she
had
been
laughing
merrily
at
some
quaint
remark
of
her
companion
but
now
it
appeared
as
though
all
her
gaiety
had
died
out
and
she
had
realised
the
true
object
of
the
stranger
mission
the
path
they
had
taken
led
straight
across
to
the
horse
guards
parade
and
feeling
a
few
moments
later
that
my
weakness
would
not
allow
me
to
walk
farther
i
was
compelled
to
turn
back
towards
the
york
column
steps
leaving
reggie
to
make
what
observations
he
could
i
returned
home
thoroughly
exhausted
and
very
cold
even
my
big
frieze
overcoat
which
i
used
for
driving
when
down
at
helpstone
did
not
keep
out
the
biting
wind
so
i
sat
over
the
fire
for
fully
a
couple
of
hours
until
my
friend
at
last
returned
i
followed
them
everywhere
he
explained
throwing
himself
into
an
armchair
opposite
me
he
evidently
threatening
her
and
she
is
afraid
of
him
when
they
got
to
the
horse
guards
they
turned
back
along
birdcage
walk
and
then
across
the
green
park
afterwards
he
drove
her
in
a
cab
to
one
of
fuller
shops
in
regent
street
the
old
priest
seems
mortally
afraid
of
being
recognised
before
he
left
the
green
park
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
so
as
to
hide
that
piece
of
purple
at
his
collar
did
you
discover
his
name
i
followed
him
to
the
where
he
is
staying
he
has
given
his
name
as
monsignore
galli
of
rimini
there
our
information
ended
it
however
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
ecclesiastic
was
in
london
with
some
distinct
purpose
probably
to
induce
the
ceco
daughter
to
give
him
certain
information
which
he
earnestly
desired
and
which
he
intended
to
obtain
by
reason
of
certain
knowledge
which
he
possessed
the
days
passed
with
gloom
and
rain
and
bloomsbury
presented
its
most
cheerless
aspect
no
trace
could
i
discover
of
my
lost
love
and
no
further
fact
concerning
the
monsignore
the
latter
had
it
appeared
left
the
on
the
following
evening
returning
in
all
probability
to
the
continent
but
whether
successful
in
his
mission
or
no
we
were
in
complete
ignorance
dolly
dawson
with
whom
reggie
had
struck
up
a
kind
of
pleasant
friendship
more
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
observe
and
question
her
than
anything
else
called
upon
us
on
the
day
following
to
inquire
after
me
and
hear
whether
we
had
learnt
anything
regarding
whereabouts
her
father
she
told
us
was
absent
from
london
for
a
few
days
and
she
was
about
to
leave
for
brighton
in
order
to
visit
an
aunt
was
it
possible
that
dawson
having
learned
of
my
solution
of
the
cipher
had
returned
to
italy
in
order
to
secure
the
cardinal
secret
from
us
i
longed
hour
by
hour
for
strength
to
travel
out
to
that
spot
beside
the
serchio
but
was
held
to
those
narrow
rooms
by
my
terrible
weakness
four
long
and
dreary
weeks
passed
until
the
middle
of
may
when
i
had
gathered
sufficient
strength
to
walk
out
alone
and
take
short
strolls
in
oxford
street
and
its
vicinity
burton
blair
will
had
been
proved
and
leighton
who
visited
us
several
times
told
us
of
the
recklessness
with
which
the
man
dawson
was
dealing
with
the
estate
that
the
adventurer
was
in
secret
communication
with
mabel
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
certain
cheques
signed
by
her
had
passed
through
his
hands
into
the
bank
yet
strangely
enough
he
declared
entire
ignorance
of
her
whereabouts
dawson
had
returned
to
grosvenor
square
when
one
day
at
noon
the
footman
carter
was
ushered
in
to
me
by
glave
i
saw
by
his
face
that
the
man
was
excited
and
scarcely
had
he
been
shown
into
my
room
before
he
exclaimed
saluting
respectfully
i
found
out
miss
mabel
address
sir
ever
since
she
been
gone
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
letters
sent
to
post
just
as
ford
suggested
that
i
should
but
dawson
never
wrote
to
her
until
this
morning
by
accident
i
think
he
sent
a
letter
to
the
post
addressed
to
her
among
a
number
of
others
which
he
gave
to
the
she
at
the
mill
house
church
enstone
near
chipping
norton
in
quick
delight
i
sprang
to
my
feet
i
thanked
him
ordered
glave
to
give
him
a
drink
and
left
london
by
the
one
train
for
oxfordshire
just
before
five
i
discovered
the
mill
house
a
grey
place
standing
back
behind
a
high
box
hedge
from
the
village
street
at
church
enstone
on
the
highroad
from
aylesbury
to
stratford
before
the
house
was
a
tiny
lawn
bright
with
tulip
borders
and
narcissi
a
opened
the
door
and
ushered
me
into
a
small
low
room
where
i
surprised
my
love
crouched
in
a
big
armchair
reading
why
mr
greenwood
she
gasped
springing
to
her
feet
pale
and
breathless
you
yes
i
said
when
the
girl
had
closed
the
door
and
we
were
alone
i
have
found
you
at
last
mabel
at
last
and
advancing
i
took
both
her
small
hands
tenderly
in
mine
then
carried
away
by
the
ecstasy
of
the
moment
i
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
saying
you
have
tried
to
escape
me
but
i
have
found
you
again
i
have
come
mabel
to
confess
openly
to
you
to
tell
you
something
to
tell
you
dearest
that
well
that
i
love
you
love
me
she
cried
dismayed
starting
back
and
putting
me
from
her
with
both
her
small
white
hands
no
no
she
wailed
you
must
not
you
can
not
love
me
it
is
impossible
why
i
demanded
quickly
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
that
first
night
when
we
met
surely
you
must
long
ago
have
detected
the
secret
of
my
heart
yes
she
faltered
i
have
but
alas
it
is
too
late
too
late
too
late
i
exclaimed
why
she
was
silent
her
countenance
had
suddenly
blanched
to
the
lips
and
i
saw
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
repeated
my
question
seriously
my
eyes
fixed
upon
her
because
she
answered
slowly
at
last
in
a
tremulous
voice
so
low
that
i
could
scarce
distinguish
the
fatal
words
she
uttered
because
i
am
already
married
married
i
gasped
standing
rigid
and
your
husband
his
name
can
not
you
guess
she
asked
the
man
you
have
already
seen
herbert
hales
her
eyes
were
cast
down
from
me
as
though
in
shame
while
her
pointed
chin
sank
upon
her
panting
breast
chapter
twenty
five
the
sacred
name
what
could
i
say
what
would
you
have
said
i
was
silent
i
knew
not
what
words
to
utter
this
scoundrelly
young
groom
the
son
of
the
respectable
old
seafarer
who
spent
the
evening
of
his
days
at
the
crossways
was
actually
the
husband
of
the
millionaire
daughter
it
seemed
utterly
incredible
yet
on
recollecting
that
midnight
scene
in
mayvill
park
i
at
once
recognised
how
powerless
she
was
in
the
hands
of
that
low
arrogant
cad
who
in
a
moment
of
mad
frenzy
had
made
such
a
desperate
attempt
upon
her
i
recognised
too
that
the
love
between
them
if
any
had
ever
existed
had
disappeared
long
ago
and
that
the
man
sole
idea
was
to
profit
by
the
fact
of
his
union
with
her
and
blackmail
her
just
as
so
many
wealthy
and
upright
women
are
being
blackmailed
in
england
at
this
very
moment
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
reason
she
did
not
follow
and
punish
the
fellow
for
that
dastardly
attempt
on
her
life
was
now
made
plain
she
was
his
wife
the
very
thought
convulsed
me
with
jealousy
regret
and
hatred
for
i
loved
her
with
all
the
passion
honest
and
true
of
which
a
man
is
capable
since
percival
had
revealed
to
me
the
truth
i
had
lived
only
for
her
to
meet
her
again
and
openly
declare
my
love
is
this
the
truth
i
asked
her
at
last
in
a
voice
the
hardness
of
which
i
could
not
control
i
took
her
cold
inert
hand
in
my
own
and
glanced
at
her
bowed
head
alas
for
me
it
is
was
her
faltering
response
he
is
my
husband
therefore
all
love
between
us
is
debarred
she
added
you
have
always
been
my
friend
greenwood
but
now
that
you
have
forced
me
to
confess
the
truth
our
friendship
is
at
an
end
and
your
husband
is
he
here
with
you
he
has
been
here
was
her
answer
but
has
gone
you
left
london
in
secret
to
join
him
i
suppose
i
remarked
bitterly
at
his
demand
he
wished
to
see
me
and
to
obtain
money
from
you
by
threats
as
he
attempted
on
that
night
at
mayvill
the
broken
girl
nodded
in
the
affirmative
i
came
to
this
place
she
explained
as
a
a
girl
i
knew
at
school
bessie
wood
lives
here
with
her
mother
they
believe
i
made
a
runaway
match
and
have
been
extremely
kind
to
me
these
last
two
years
then
you
been
a
wife
for
two
whole
years
i
exclaimed
in
blank
surprise
utterly
amazed
at
the
manner
in
which
i
had
been
deceived
for
nearly
that
time
we
were
married
at
wymondham
in
norfolk
tell
me
the
whole
story
mabel
i
urged
after
a
long
pause
endeavouring
to
preserve
an
outward
calm
which
certainly
did
not
coincide
with
my
innermost
feelings
her
breast
heaved
and
fell
beneath
its
lace
and
chiffons
her
great
wonderful
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
for
fully
five
minutes
she
was
overcome
by
her
emotion
and
quite
unable
to
speak
at
last
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
she
said
i
do
know
what
you
must
think
of
me
greenwood
i
ashamed
of
myself
and
of
the
manner
in
which
i
deceived
you
my
only
excuse
is
that
it
was
imperative
i
married
because
i
was
forced
to
by
a
chain
of
circumstances
as
you
will
realise
when
you
know
the
truth
then
she
was
silent
again
but
you
tell
me
the
truth
wo
you
i
urged
i
as
your
best
friend
as
indeed
the
man
who
has
loved
you
have
surely
a
right
to
know
she
only
shook
her
head
in
bitter
sorrow
and
looking
at
me
through
her
tears
answered
briefly
i
have
told
you
the
truth
i
am
married
i
can
only
ask
your
pardon
for
deceiving
you
and
explain
that
i
was
compelled
to
do
so
you
mean
that
you
were
compelled
to
marry
him
compelled
by
whom
by
him
she
faltered
one
morning
two
years
ago
i
left
london
alone
and
met
him
at
wymondham
where
i
had
previously
been
staying
for
a
fortnight
while
my
father
was
fishing
herbert
met
me
at
the
station
and
we
were
married
in
secret
two
men
picked
at
haphazard
from
the
street
acting
as
witnesses
after
the
ceremony
we
parted
i
took
off
my
ring
and
returned
home
no
one
being
the
wiser
we
had
a
that
evening
lord
newborough
lady
rainham
and
yourself
were
there
and
we
went
to
the
haymarket
afterwards
do
you
recollect
it
as
we
sat
in
the
box
you
asked
me
why
i
was
so
dull
and
thoughtful
and
i
pleaded
a
headache
ah
if
you
had
but
known
i
recollect
the
night
perfectly
i
said
pitying
her
and
it
was
your
wedding
evening
but
how
did
he
compel
you
to
marry
him
the
motive
is
of
course
quite
plain
he
wished
either
to
profit
by
the
fact
that
you
could
not
afford
to
allow
the
truth
to
be
known
that
you
were
the
wife
of
a
groom
or
else
his
intention
was
to
gain
possession
of
your
money
at
your
father
death
yours
is
certainly
not
the
first
marriage
of
the
sort
that
has
been
contracted
i
added
with
a
feeling
of
blank
dismay
at
the
very
moment
when
my
hopes
had
been
raised
to
their
highest
level
by
percival
statement
the
blow
had
fallen
and
in
an
instant
i
saw
that
love
was
impossible
mabel
the
woman
i
loved
so
fondly
and
so
well
was
the
wife
of
a
loutish
brute
who
was
torturing
her
to
madness
by
his
threats
and
would
as
already
had
been
proved
hesitate
at
nothing
in
order
to
gain
his
despicable
ends
my
feelings
were
indescribable
no
words
of
mine
can
give
any
adequate
idea
of
how
torn
was
my
heart
by
conflicting
emotions
until
that
moment
she
had
been
beneath
my
protection
yet
now
that
she
was
the
wife
of
another
i
had
no
right
to
control
her
actions
no
right
to
admire
no
right
to
love
ah
if
ever
man
felt
crushed
despairing
and
hopeless
if
ever
man
realised
how
aimless
and
empty
his
lonely
life
had
been
i
did
at
that
moment
i
tried
to
induce
her
to
tell
me
how
the
fellow
had
compelled
her
to
marry
him
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
and
choked
me
tears
must
i
suppose
have
stood
in
my
eyes
for
with
a
sudden
sympathy
an
outburst
of
that
womanly
feeling
so
strong
within
her
she
placed
her
hand
tenderly
upon
my
shoulder
and
said
in
a
low
calm
voice
we
can
not
recall
the
past
therefore
why
reflect
act
as
i
asked
you
to
act
in
my
letter
forgive
me
and
forget
leave
me
to
my
own
sorrows
i
know
now
that
you
have
loved
me
but
it
is
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
for
she
burst
into
tears
i
know
what
you
mean
i
said
blankly
too
late
yes
too
late
both
our
lives
have
been
wrecked
by
my
own
folly
because
i
hid
from
you
what
i
as
an
honest
man
should
have
told
you
long
ago
no
no
gilbert
she
cried
calling
me
for
the
first
time
by
my
christian
name
do
say
that
the
fault
is
not
yours
but
mine
mine
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
where
is
this
husband
of
yours
this
man
who
tried
to
kill
you
i
demanded
fiercely
a
few
moments
later
somewhere
in
the
north
i
think
he
has
been
here
when
he
came
a
week
ago
and
remained
a
couple
of
hours
but
he
shall
not
blackmail
you
in
this
manner
if
i
can
not
remain
your
lover
i
nevertheless
still
stand
your
champion
mabel
i
cried
in
determination
he
shall
reckon
with
me
ah
no
she
gasped
turning
to
me
in
quick
apprehension
you
must
do
nothing
otherwise
he
may
what
may
he
do
she
was
silent
gazing
aimlessly
out
of
the
window
across
the
broad
now
misty
and
silent
in
the
dusk
he
may
she
said
in
a
low
broken
voice
he
may
tell
the
world
the
truth
what
truth
the
truth
he
knows
the
knowledge
by
which
he
compelled
me
to
become
his
wife
and
she
held
her
hand
to
her
breast
as
though
to
stay
the
wild
beating
of
her
young
heart
i
tried
to
induce
her
to
reveal
that
secret
to
me
her
most
devoted
friend
but
she
refused
no
she
said
in
a
low
broken
voice
do
not
ask
me
gilbert
for
i
know
now
that
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
you
by
your
christian
name
because
i
can
not
tell
you
of
all
men
it
is
for
me
to
remain
silent
and
to
suffer
her
face
was
very
pale
and
i
saw
by
her
look
of
determination
that
her
mind
was
made
up
even
though
she
trusted
me
as
she
did
nevertheless
no
power
would
induce
her
to
reveal
the
truth
to
me
but
you
know
what
reason
your
father
had
in
appointing
his
friend
dawson
to
be
controller
of
your
fortune
i
said
i
felt
confident
that
a
word
from
you
would
result
in
his
withdrawal
from
the
office
he
now
holds
you
can
not
affect
ignorance
of
this
mysterious
motive
of
your
father
i
have
already
told
you
my
poor
father
also
acted
under
compulsion
leighton
also
knows
that
and
you
are
aware
of
the
reason
she
nodded
in
the
affirmative
then
you
could
checkmate
the
fellow
plans
yes
i
might
she
answered
slowly
if
i
only
dared
what
do
you
fear
i
fear
what
my
father
feared
was
her
answer
and
what
was
that
that
he
would
carry
out
a
certain
threat
he
has
many
times
made
to
my
father
and
later
to
myself
he
threatened
me
on
the
day
i
left
home
he
dared
me
to
breathe
a
single
word
yes
that
man
held
power
complete
and
absolute
over
her
just
as
he
had
boasted
to
percival
he
also
knew
the
truth
concerning
the
cardinal
secret
we
sat
together
in
that
small
low
room
until
dusk
darkened
into
night
when
she
rose
wearily
and
lit
the
lamp
then
i
was
startled
by
discovering
by
its
light
how
her
sweet
face
had
changed
her
cheeks
had
grown
wan
and
pale
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
and
her
whole
countenance
betrayed
a
deep
burning
anxiety
a
terror
of
what
the
unknown
future
held
for
her
surely
hers
was
a
strange
almost
inconceivable
position
a
pretty
young
woman
with
a
balance
of
over
two
millions
at
her
bankers
and
yet
hounded
by
those
who
sought
her
ruin
degradation
and
death
the
fact
that
she
was
married
had
struck
me
a
staggering
blow
to
her
i
could
now
be
no
more
than
a
mere
friend
like
any
other
man
all
thoughts
of
love
being
bebarred
all
hope
of
happiness
abandoned
i
had
never
sought
her
for
her
fortune
that
i
can
honestly
avow
i
had
loved
her
for
her
own
sweet
pure
self
because
i
knew
that
her
heart
beat
true
and
loyal
that
in
strength
of
character
in
disposition
in
grace
and
in
beauty
she
was
peerless
for
a
long
time
i
held
her
hand
feeling
i
think
some
satisfaction
in
thus
repeating
the
action
of
other
times
now
that
i
had
to
bid
farewell
to
all
my
hopes
and
aspirations
she
sat
silent
troubled
sighs
escaping
her
as
i
spoke
telling
her
of
that
strange
midnight
adventure
in
the
streets
of
kensington
and
of
how
near
i
had
been
to
death
then
knowing
that
you
have
gained
the
secret
written
upon
the
cards
they
have
made
an
attempt
to
seal
your
lips
she
said
at
last
in
a
hard
mechanical
voice
almost
as
though
speaking
to
herself
ah
did
i
not
warn
you
of
that
in
my
letter
did
i
not
tell
you
that
the
secret
is
so
well
and
ingeniously
guarded
that
you
will
never
succeed
in
either
learning
it
or
profiting
by
it
but
i
intend
to
persevere
in
the
solution
of
the
mystery
of
your
father
fortune
i
declared
still
with
her
hand
in
mine
in
sad
and
bitter
farewell
he
left
his
secret
to
me
and
i
have
determined
to
start
out
to
italy
to
search
the
spot
indicated
and
to
learn
the
truth
then
you
can
just
save
yourself
that
trouble
mister
exclaimed
the
voice
of
a
common
uneducated
man
startling
me
and
on
turning
suddenly
i
saw
that
the
door
had
opened
noiselessly
and
there
upon
the
threshold
watching
us
with
apparent
satisfaction
was
the
man
who
stood
between
me
and
my
that
skulking
fellow
who
claimed
her
by
the
sacred
name
of
wife
chapter
twenty
six
face
to
face
i
much
like
to
know
what
your
business
is
demanded
the
fellow
whose
grey
bowler
hat
and
gaiters
gave
him
a
distinctly
horsey
appearance
and
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
he
folded
his
arms
defiantly
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
my
business
is
my
own
affair
i
answered
facing
him
in
disgust
if
it
concerns
my
wife
i
have
a
right
to
know
he
persisted
your
wife
i
cried
advancing
towards
him
with
difficulty
repressing
the
strong
impulse
within
me
to
knock
the
young
ruffian
down
call
her
your
wife
fellow
call
her
by
her
true
name
your
victim
do
you
mean
that
as
an
insult
he
exclaimed
quickly
his
face
turning
white
with
sudden
anger
whereupon
mabel
seeing
his
threatening
attitude
sprang
between
us
and
begged
me
to
be
calm
there
are
some
men
whom
no
words
can
insult
i
replied
forcibly
and
you
are
one
of
them
what
do
you
mean
he
cried
do
you
wish
to
pick
a
quarrel
and
he
came
forward
with
clenched
fists
i
desire
no
quarrel
was
my
quick
response
i
only
order
you
to
leave
this
lady
in
peace
she
may
be
legally
your
wife
but
i
will
stand
as
her
protector
oh
he
sneered
with
curling
lip
and
i
like
to
know
by
what
right
you
interfere
between
us
by
the
common
right
every
man
has
to
shield
an
unprotected
and
persecuted
woman
i
replied
firmly
i
know
you
and
am
well
aware
of
your
shameful
past
shall
i
recall
one
incident
that
now
you
attempt
to
defy
me
you
appear
to
have
conveniently
forgotten
do
you
not
recollect
a
certain
night
in
the
park
at
mayvill
not
so
very
long
ago
and
do
you
not
recollect
that
you
there
attempted
to
commit
a
foul
and
brutal
murder
eh
he
started
quickly
then
glared
at
me
with
the
fire
of
a
murderous
hatred
in
his
eyes
she
told
you
damn
her
she
given
me
away
he
exclaimed
with
a
contemptuous
glance
at
his
trembling
wife
no
she
has
not
was
my
response
i
myself
chanced
to
be
witness
of
your
dastardly
attempt
upon
her
it
was
i
who
succeeded
in
rescuing
her
from
the
river
for
that
action
of
yours
you
must
now
answer
to
me
what
do
you
mean
he
inquired
and
from
the
lines
in
his
countenance
i
saw
that
my
outspoken
manner
caused
him
considerable
uneasiness
i
mean
that
it
is
not
for
you
to
attempt
defiance
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
fortunate
circumstance
of
my
presence
in
the
park
you
would
be
a
murderer
he
shrank
at
that
final
word
like
all
his
class
he
was
arrogant
and
overbearing
to
the
weak
but
as
easily
cowed
by
firmness
as
a
dog
who
cringes
at
his
master
voice
and
now
i
continued
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
on
the
night
when
you
would
have
killed
this
poor
woman
who
is
your
victim
i
also
overheard
your
demands
you
are
a
blackmailer
the
meanest
and
worst
type
of
criminal
humanity
and
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
there
is
a
severe
and
stringent
law
against
such
an
offence
as
yours
you
demanded
money
by
threats
and
on
refusal
made
a
desperate
endeavour
to
take
your
wife
life
in
the
assize
court
the
evidence
i
could
give
against
you
would
put
you
into
a
term
of
penal
servitude
you
understand
therefore
i
make
this
compact
with
you
if
you
will
promise
not
to
molest
your
wife
further
i
will
remain
silent
and
who
the
deuce
are
you
pray
to
talk
to
me
in
this
manner
like
a
gaol
chaplain
on
his
weekly
round
you
better
keep
a
civil
tongue
fellow
and
just
reflect
upon
my
words
i
said
i
no
man
for
argument
i
act
act
just
as
you
like
i
shall
do
as
i
think
proper
you
hear
and
you
take
the
risk
very
well
i
said
you
know
the
worst
prison
and
you
do
he
laughed
otherwise
you
would
talk
like
a
silly
idiot
mabel
is
my
wife
and
you
no
say
in
the
matter
so
enough
for
you
he
added
insultingly
instead
of
trying
to
threaten
me
it
is
i
who
have
a
right
to
demand
why
i
find
you
here
with
her
i
tell
you
i
cried
angrily
my
hands
itching
to
give
the
impudent
young
blackguard
a
sound
good
hiding
i
here
to
protect
her
because
she
is
in
fear
of
her
life
and
i
shall
remain
here
until
you
have
gone
but
i
her
husband
therefore
i
shall
stay
sneered
the
fellow
perfectly
unmoved
then
she
leaves
with
me
i
said
decisively
i
not
allow
that
you
will
act
just
as
i
think
proper
i
exclaimed
then
turning
to
mabel
who
had
remained
white
silent
and
trembling
in
fear
lest
we
should
come
to
blows
i
said
put
on
your
hat
and
coat
at
once
you
must
return
to
london
with
me
she
shall
not
he
cried
unflinchingly
if
my
curses
could
blast
yer
you
have
thick
mabel
i
said
taking
no
notice
of
the
ruffian
words
but
drawing
back
to
allow
her
to
pass
out
please
get
your
coat
i
have
a
fly
waiting
outside
the
fellow
made
a
movement
as
though
to
prevent
her
leaving
the
room
but
in
an
instant
my
hand
was
heavily
upon
his
shoulder
and
by
my
face
he
saw
that
i
was
strong
and
determined
you
repent
this
he
hissed
threateningly
with
an
imprecation
between
his
teeth
i
know
what
you
are
searching
for
but
he
laughed
you
never
obtain
that
secret
which
gave
blair
his
millions
you
think
you
a
clue
to
it
but
before
long
you
discover
your
mistake
in
what
in
not
uniting
with
me
instead
of
insulting
me
i
have
no
necessity
for
the
assistance
of
any
man
who
would
kill
a
helpless
woman
i
responded
recollect
that
in
this
affair
you
hold
aloof
from
her
or
by
gad
without
further
ado
i
seek
the
aid
of
the
police
when
your
past
history
will
prove
rather
unwelcome
evidence
of
character
do
what
you
like
he
laughed
again
defiantly
by
giving
me
over
to
the
police
you
only
be
doing
her
the
worst
turn
possible
if
you
doubt
me
you
better
ask
her
be
careful
how
you
act
before
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
and
a
victim
of
her
and
with
this
harsh
hollow
sneer
he
threw
himself
into
the
armchair
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
fender
in
an
attitude
of
carelessness
and
calmly
lit
a
cheap
rank
cigar
there
will
be
only
one
sufferer
never
fear
i
said
meaningly
and
that
will
be
yourself
all
right
he
said
we
shall
see
then
turning
i
left
the
room
and
meeting
mabel
who
stood
ready
dressed
in
the
hall
whispering
a
hurried
adieu
to
bessie
wood
her
old
schoolfellow
i
hurried
her
out
put
her
into
the
station
fly
and
drove
with
her
back
to
chipping
norton
even
then
however
i
could
not
understand
the
exact
position
of
that
young
ruffian
herbert
hales
or
the
true
meaning
of
his
final
ominous
words
of
open
defiance
for
the
present
i
had
rescued
my
love
from
the
arrogant
brute
and
blackmailer
but
for
how
brief
a
space
i
dreaded
to
anticipate
my
own
position
utterly
in
the
dark
as
i
remained
was
one
of
uncertainty
and
insecurity
i
loved
mabel
but
now
had
no
right
to
do
so
she
was
already
the
wife
alas
the
victim
of
a
man
of
low
type
and
of
criminal
instinct
our
journey
up
to
paddington
was
uneventful
and
in
almost
complete
silence
both
our
hearts
beating
sadly
were
too
full
for
mere
words
the
insurmountable
barrier
had
fallen
between
us
we
were
both
and
the
hopeful
past
had
ended
the
future
was
one
of
dull
and
dark
despair
on
arrival
in
london
she
expressed
a
desire
to
see
percival
and
as
she
declined
to
return
beneath
the
same
roof
as
dawson
i
took
her
to
the
in
albemarle
street
then
the
cab
i
drove
to
grosvenor
square
where
i
informed
the
chaperon
of
my
lost
whereabouts
not
an
instant
did
percival
delay
in
seeking
her
and
at
midnight
accompanied
by
reggie
i
called
again
at
the
hotel
giving
her
certain
injunctions
to
refuse
to
see
her
husband
even
if
he
discovered
her
and
taking
a
lingering
farewell
of
her
as
we
had
arranged
to
leave
charing
cross
for
italy
by
the
mail
at
nine
on
the
following
morning
both
reggie
and
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
now
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
travel
we
should
not
lose
an
instant
in
going
out
to
tuscany
and
investigating
the
truth
regarding
that
cipher
record
so
she
bade
us
both
farewell
and
urging
us
not
to
worry
further
upon
her
account
although
we
did
not
fail
to
detect
her
wild
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
my
defiance
of
her
ruffianly
husband
she
wished
us
all
good
fortune
and
godspeed
in
the
exciting
venture
we
were
about
to
undertake
with
success
and
a
safe
return

its
brightest
and
best
in
the
month
of
may
the
time
of
flowers
in
italy
far
removed
from
the
great
routes
over
which
the
english
americans
and
germans
swarm
in
winter
unvisited
unknown
and
unexplored
by
any
save
the
simple
of
the
hills
the
rippling
river
winds
with
tortuous
bends
around
sharp
angles
and
beneath
overhanging
trees
great
cliffs
and
huge
grey
boulders
worn
smooth
by
the
action
of

water

ages
in
those
lonely
reaches
of
the
river
as
it
dashes
on
with
many
cascades

the
brilliant

and
the
stately
heron
are
in
possession
and
live

lives
undisturbed
by
human
intrusion
as
we
walked
on
having
left
the
carriage
that
had
brought
us
up
from
lucca
at
the
quaint
mediaeval
bridge
called
the
ponte
del
diavolo
the
rural
quiet
and
picturesque
beauty
of
the
scene
became
impressed
upon
us
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
for
the
hum
of
the
myriad
insects
in
the
sun
and
the
low
music
of
the
water
which
at
that
point
is
shallow
running
over
its
rocky
bed
on
arrival
at
the
in
lucca
my
first
impulse
was
to
go
up
to
the
monastery
and
see
fra
antonio
yet
so
intimate
did
he
appear
to
be
with
blair
partner
the
dawson
that
we
resolved
to
first
explore
the
spot
and
take
some
observations
therefore
at
eight
that
morning
we
had
entered
one
of
those
dusty
old
travelling
tuscan
carriages
the
horses
of
which
bore
many
jingling
bells
and
now
as
noon
was
approaching
we
found
ourselves
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
counting
the
four
hundred
and
as
directed
by
the
secret
record
upon
the
cards
to
avoid
being
watched
by
our
driver
to
whom
we
had
given
instructions
to
go
back
to
a
little
wayside
trattoria
or
which
we
had
passed
but
who
we
knew
would
endeavour
to
secretly
watch
our
movements
we
were
at
first
compelled
on
account
of
the
absence
of
a
path
to
make
a
detour
through
a
small
wood
rejoining
the
river
bank
at
some
distance
further
up
therefore
as
we
reached
the
water
standing
amid
the
high
undergrowth
that
grew
upon
the
banks
we
could
only
look
back
at
the
bridge
and
guess
that
we
were
about
one
hundred
from
it
then
tramping
steadily
forward
in
single
file
we
pushed
our
way
with
difficulty
through
the
tall
grass
briars
giant
ferns
and
tangled
creepers
slowly
onward
towards
the
spot
indicated
in
places
the
trees
met
overhead
and
the
sun
shining
through
the
foliage
struck
the
rippling
water
with
pretty
effect
according
to
the
record
the
spot
must
be
in
the
open
for
the
sun
shone
upon
it
for
one
hour
at
noon
on
the
fifth
of
april
and
for
two
hours
on
the
fifth
of
may
it
was
now
the
nineteenth
of
may
therefore
the
duration
of
the
sunshine
would
we
roughly
calculated
be
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
in
some
places
the
river
was
open
to
the
sun
while
in
others
so
high
were
the
banks
on
either
side
the
light
could
never
penetrate
there
from
the
crevices
of
the
overhanging
rocks
mountain
pines
and
other
trees
had
taken
root
and
grown
to
huge
size
bending
over
until
their
branches
almost
swept
the
stream
while
our
progress
was
made
slower
and
more
difficult
by
the
unevenness
of
the
bank
and
the
wild
tangle
of
the
undergrowth
one
fact
was
proved
no
one
had
approached
the
spot
for
a
considerable
time
for
we
found
not
a
twig
severed
or
a
leaf
disturbed
by
previous
intruders
at
last
after
we
had
climbed
high
along
a
rocky
cliff
that
descended
sheer
into
the
water
and
had
calculated
four
hundred
and
twenty
steps
from
the
old
pointed
bridge
we
suddenly
rounded
a
bend
in
the
river
and
came
upon
a
space
where
the
stream
still
a
hundred
feet
or
so
below
broadened
out
so
that
it
lay
open
to
the
sky
for
forty
yards
or
so
it
must
be
here
i
cried
in
eager
anticipation
halting
and
quickly
surveying
the
spot
the
directions
are
to
descend
i
suppose
that
means
steps
cut
in
the
rock
we
must
find
them
and
both
of
us
began
to
search
eagerly
but
in
that
tangled
growth
we
could
discover
no
trace
of
them
the
record
says
that
we
go
down
behind
where
a
man
can
hold
himself
against
four
hundred
exclaimed
reggie
reading
from
a
copy
of
the
transcript
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
that
appears
as
if
the
entry
is
in
some
narrow
crevice
between
two
rocks
do
you
see
any
such
likely
spot
i
looked
eagerly
around
but
was
compelled
to
admit
that
i
discerned
nothing
that
coincided
with
the
description
so
sheer
was
the
grey
limestone
cliff
going
down
to
the
water
that
i
approached
its
edge
with
caution
and
then
throwing
myself
upon
my
stomach
i
crept
forward
and
peered
over
its
insecure
edge
in
doing
so
a
huge
piece
of
rock
became
loosened
and
fell
with
a
roar
and
splash
into
the
stream
i
took
careful
observations
but
could
distinguish
absolutely
nothing
to
correspond
with
what
the
old
outlaw
poldo
pensi
had
recorded
for
a
full
we
searched
in
vain
until
it
became
plain
that
as
we
had
not
measured
accurately
the
from
the
devil
bridge
we
were
not
at
the
exact
spot
we
therefore
retraced
our
steps
slowly
and
laboriously
through
the
tangled
briars
and
undergrowth
our
clothes
suffering
considerably
and
then
restarted
from
the
actual
base
of
the
bridge
so
completely
had
we
been
out
of
reckoning
that
at
the
three
hundred
and
pace
we
passed
the
spot
where
we
had
made
such
minute
search
and
continuing
our
way
forward
we
halted
at
the
four
hundred
and
in
the
top
of
a
high
encampment
very
similar
to
the
other
only
wilder
and
even
more
inaccessible
there
seems
nothing
here
remarked
reggie
whose
face
was
torn
by
brambles
and
was
bleeding
i
gazed
around
and
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
endorse
his
statement
the
trees
were
large
and
shady
where
we
stood
some
of
them
overhanging
the
deep
chasm
through
which
the
river
wound
cautiously
we
both
crept
forward
flat
upon
our
stomachs
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
taking
that
precaution
as
we
knew
not
whether
the
edge
might
be
rotten
and
presently
we
peered
over
why
look
cried
my
friend
pointing
to
a
spot
about
down
the
deep
swirling
stream
as
it
came
round
the
sudden
bend
there
steps
and
a
path
leading
down
just
a
little
higher
up
and
see
what
that
chapter
twenty
eight
describes
a
startling
discovery
i
looked
and
saw
that
upon
a
kind
of
natural
platform
on
the
rock
was
built
a
small
stone
hut
upon
the
roof
of
which
we
were
gazing
down
yes
there
are
the
mentioned
in
the
record
no
doubt
i
said
i
wonder
if
anybody
lives
down
there
well
let
descend
and
investigate
suggested
reggie
anxiously
and
a
few
moments
later
we
had
struck
a
narrow
track
leading
from
the
chestnut
wood
direct
to
the
steps
that
went
down
to
a
narrow
opening
between
two
rocks
upon
the
right
hand
one
we
found
deeply
graven
an
capital
e
about
a
foot
long
and
passing
by
it
we
saw
that
a
rough
and
perilous
track
led
zigzag
down
to
the
small
hut
the
closed
door
and
small
barred
window
of
which
caused
us
the
wildest
curiosity
as
to
what
was
within
next
moment
however
the
truth
was
plain
the
front
of
the
little
place
was
pointed
and
upon
the
apex
was
a
small
stone
cross
it
was
a
hermit
cell
like
so
many
similar
ancient
places
of
retreat
and
contemplation
in
italy
and
an
instant
later
as
we
passed
the
rocks
and
came
cautiously
down
the
path
the
door
opened
and
there
issued
forth
the
hermit
himself
who
to
my
surprise
i
recognised
as
no
other
person
than
the
burly
monk
antonio
gentlemen
he
exclaimed
speaking
in
italian
as
he
greeted
us
this
is
certainly
an
unexpected
meeting
and
he
indicated
the
stone
bench
that
ran
along
the
outside
of
the
low
little
hut
which
i
saw
was
so
cunningly
concealed
by
the
overhanging
trees
as
to
be
invisible
either
from
the
river
or
from
the
opposite
bank
as
we
seated
ourselves
at
his
direction
he
hitched
up
his
faded
brown
habit
beneath
his
and
himself
sat
down
beside
us
i
expressed
surprise
at
finding
him
there
but
he
only
smiled
saying
you
are
disappointed
at
discovering
nothing
else
eh
we
expected
to
reveal
the
secret
of
the
cardinal
sannini
was
my
frank
response
well
knowing
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
truth
and
suspecting
that
with
the
englishman
he
had
been
partner
with
blair
the
monk
sunburnt
features
assumed
a
puzzled
expression
for
he
saw
that
we
had
gained
some
knowledge
yet
he
hesitated
to
make
inquiry
lest
he
should
betray
himself
capuchins
like
jesuits
are
wonderful
diplomatists
doubtless
the
personal
fascination
was
somewhat
due
to
his
splendid
presence
a
man
of
fine
physique
he
had
a
handsome
open
face
with
powerful
features
softened
by
eyes
in
which
seemed
the
light
of
perpetual
youth
with
a
candid
unassuming
expression
brightened
by
a
twinkling
humour
about
the
lips
you
have
recovered
the
record
then
he
remarked
at
last
looking
straight
into
my
face
yes
and
having
read
it
i
answered
i
am
here
to
investigate
and
claim
the
secret
bequeathed
to
me
he
drew
a
long
breath
glanced
for
an
instant
at
both
of
us
and
his
shaggy
black
brows
contracted
it
was
hot
where
we
sat
for
the
brilliant
italian
sun
beat
straight
down
upon
us
therefore
without
replying
to
me
he
rose
and
invited
us
into
his
cool
little
cell
a
square
bare
room
with
boarded
floor
the
furniture
consisting
of
a
low
wooden
bedstead
with
a
piece
of
old
brown
blanket
for
coverlet
a
renaissance
in
old
carved
oak
black
with
age
a
chair
a
hanging
lamp
and
upon
the
wall
a
great
crucifix
well
and
the
signor
dawson
he
asked
at
last
when
reggie
had
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
i
had
taken
the
chair
what
does
he
say
i
have
no
necessity
to
ask
his
opinion
i
responded
quickly
by
law
the
cardinal
secret
is
mine
and
no
one
can
dispute
it
except
its
present
holder
was
his
quiet
remark
its
present
holder
has
no
right
to
it
burton
blair
has
made
gift
of
it
to
me
and
it
is
therefore
mine
i
declared
i
do
not
dispute
that
answered
the
monk
but
as
guardian
of
the
cardinal
secret
i
have
a
right
to
know
the
manner
in
which
the
record
upon
the
cards
came
into
your
hands
and
how
you
gained
the
key
to
the
cipher
i
related
to
him
exactly
what
he
wished
to
ascertain
whereupon
he
answered
you
have
certainly
succeeded
where
i
anticipated
that
you
would
fail
and
your
presence
here
surprises
me
apparently
you
have
overcome
every
obstacle
and
are
now
here
to
claim
from
me
what
is
undoubtedly
yours
by
right
he
seemed
yet
i
confess
i
was
loth
to
trust
men
of
his
stamp
very
far
and
was
therefore
still
suspicious
before
we
go
further
however
he
said
standing
with
his
hands
in
the
wide
sleeves
of
his
habit
i
would
ask
whether
it
is
your
intention
to
continue
the
methods
of
the
signor
blair
who
allotted
part
of
the
money
derived
from
the
secret
to
our
order
of
capuchins
certainly
i
answered
rather
surprised
my
desire
is
to
regard
in
every
particular
my
dead
friend
obligations
then
that
is
a
promise
he
said
with
some
eagerness
you
make
that
solemnly
you
take
an
oath
raise
your
hand
and
he
pointed
to
the
great
crucifix
upon
the
wall
i
raised
my
hand
and
exclaimed
i
swear
to
act
as
burton
blair
has
acted
very
well
answered
the
monk
apparently
satisfied
that
i
was
a
man
of
honour
then
i
suppose
the
secret
strange
as
it
will
strike
you
must
now
be
revealed
to
you
think
signore
at
this
moment
you
are
a
comparatively
poor
man
yet
in
half
an
hour
you
will
be
rich
beyond
your
wildest
dreams
worth
millions
just
as
burton
blair
became
i
listened
to
him
scarcely
believing
my
ears
yet
what
was
the
possession
of
riches
to
me
now
that
i
had
lost
my
love
from
a
little
cupboard
he
took
a
small
rusty
old
hurricane
lamp
and
carefully
lit
it
while
we
both
watched
with
breathless
interest
then
he
closed
the
door
and
securely
locked
and
barred
it
afterwards
placing
the
shutters
to
the
window
so
that
we
were
quickly
in
darkness
was
some
supernatural
illusion
about
to
be
shown
us
we
stood
in
expectation
a
moment
later
he
dragged
his
low
ponderous
bedstead
away
from
the
corner
where
we
saw
that
in
the
floor
was
a
which
on
being
lifted
disclosed
a
deep
dark
hole
beneath
be
careful
he
cautioned
us
the
steps
are
rather
difficult
in
places
and
holding
the
lantern
he
soon
disappeared
leaving
us
to
follow
him
down
a
spiral
flight
of
in
the
stone
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
solid
rock
damp
and
slimy
in
places
where
the
water
percolated
through
and
fell
in
drops
bend
low
ordered
our
guide
and
we
saw
the
faint
glimmer
of
this
lamp
lighting
our
path
along
a
narrow
tortuous
burrow
which
ran
away
at
right
angles
and
sloped
down
still
further
into
the
heart
of
the
cliff
in
places
we
went
through
a
veritable
quagmire
of
mud
and
slime
while
the
close
atmosphere
smelt
foul
and
earthy
suddenly
we
emerged
into
a
great
opening
the
dimensions
of
which
we
could
not
ascertain
with
that
one
single
glimmering
light
these
caverns
run
for
miles
explained
the
monk
the
galleries
run
in
all
directions
right
under
the
city
of
lucca
and
over
towards
the
arno
they
have
never
been
explored
listen
in
the
weird
darkness
we
heard
the
distant
roaring
of
tumbling
waters
far
away
that
is
the
subterranean
river
the
stream
that
divides
the
secret
from
all
men
save
yourself
he
said
then
he
went
forward
again
keeping
along
one
side
of
the
gigantic
cavern
through
which
we
were
passing
and
we
followed
approaching
nearer
those
thundering
waters
until
at
last
he
told
us
to
halt
and
appeared
to
be
examining
the
rough
walls
upon
which
shone
great
glittering
stalactites
presently
he
found
a
large
white
mark
similar
to
the
letter
e
on
the
rock
upon
the
and
placed
his
lantern
on
the
floor
do
move
another
step
forward
he
said
then
he
produced
from
a
hole
where
it
appeared
to
be
well
hidden
a
long
footbridge
consisting
of
a
single
plank
with
a
light
handrail
on
each
side
this
he
pushed
before
him
while
i
held
the
lantern
until
he
came
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
chasm
and
then
bridged
it
across
so
that
we
could
pass
over
when
in
the
centre
he
held
aloft
the
lantern
and
as
we
peered
down
a
hundred
feet
we
shuddered
to
see
deep
down
in
the
chasm
the
rushing
flood
of
black
water
roaring
away
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
terrible
trap
to
those
who
ventured
to
explore
that
weird
dank
place
having
passed
safely
over
we
again
skirted
a
wall
of
rock
to
the
right
traversed
a
long
narrow
tunnel
and
at
last
emerged
into
another
open
space
of
the
dimensions
of
which
we
could
gather
no
idea
here
the
monk
set
down
his
lantern
in
a
niche
wherein
stood
several
candles
stuck
upon
rude
boards
and
secured
between
three
nails
when
they
were
lit
and
our
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
light
we
saw
that
the
chamber
was
not
a
large
one
but
that
it
was
long
narrow
and
somewhat
drier
than
the
rest
see
exclaimed
the
capuchin
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
it
is
all
there
signor
greenwood
and
all
yours
then
i
realised
to
my
utter
amazement
that
around
the
walls
of
the
place
piled
high
one
on
the
other
were
sacks
of
untanned
hide
filled
to
bursting
one
pile
close
to
my
hand
i
touched
and
found
that
what
was
within
them
was
hard
angular
and
unyielding
there
were
many
small
chests
which
from
their
strong
appearance
banded
with
rusted
iron
and
studded
with
nails
must
i
knew
contain
the
mysterious
riches
that
raised
burton
blair
from
homeless
wayfarer
to
millionaire
why
surely
this
is
an
actual
hoard
of
treasure
i
cried
yes
answered
fra
antonio
in
his
deep
bass
voice
the
hidden
treasure
of
the
vatican
see
he
added
it
is
all
here
except
that
portion
taken
out
by
the
signor
blair
and
opening
one
of
the
massive
chests
he
held
his
lantern
above
and
displayed
such
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
golden
chalices
monstrances
patens
vestments
and
magnificent
gems
such
as
had
never
before
dazzled
my
eyes
both
reggie
and
i
stood
utterly
dumbfounded
at
first
i
seemed
to
be
living
in
some
fairy
world
of
legend
and
romance
but
when
a
moment
later
the
rugged
bearded
face
of
the
capuchin
recalled
to
me
all
the
past
i
stood
in
wonder
the
secret
of
burton
blair
was
disclosed
and
the
secret
was
now
mine
ah
exclaimed
the
monk
laughing
no
doubt
this
revelation
is
to
you
an
amazing
one
did
i
not
however
promise
you
that
in
half
an
hour
you
would
become
many
times
over
a
millionaire
yes
but
tell
me
the
history
of
all
this
great
wealth
i
urged
for
he
had
cut
open
one
or
two
of
the
leathern
bags
and
i
saw
that
each
of
them
was
filled
with
gold
and
gems
mostly
set
in
crucifixes
and
ornaments
of
an
ecclesiastical
character
chapter
twenty
nine
in
which
a
strange
tale
is
told
i
suppose
it
is
only
just
that
you
should
now
know
the
truth
although
a
most
strenuous
effort
has
been
made
to
keep
it
from
you
the
monk
remarked
as
though
to
himself
well
it
is
this
you
as
a
protestant
probably
know
that
the
treasures
in
the
vatican
in
rome
are
the
greatest
in
the
world
and
also
that
each
pope
on
his
jubilee
or
other
notable
anniversary
receives
a
vast
number
of
presents
while
the
church
of
peter
itself
is
constantly
in
receipt
of
quantities
of
ornaments
and
jewels
as
votive
offerings
these
are
preserved
in
the
treasury
of
the
vatican
and
constitute
a
collection
of
wealth
unequalled
by
all
the
millions
of
modern
millionaires
well
in
the
early
part
of
pope
pius
ix
received
through
the
marvellous
diplomatic
channels
our
holy
church
possesses
secret
information
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
italian
troops
to
bombard
and
enter
rome
and
sack
the
palace
of
the
vatican
his
holiness
confided
his
fears
to
his
favourite
the
great
cardinal
sannini
the
who
having
lived
in
this
district
when
a
peasant
lad
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
safe
he
therefore
succeeded
during
the
months
of
june
july
and
august
in
secretly
removing
a
vast
quantity
of
the
vatican
treasure
from
rome
and
storing
it
in
this
place
in
order
to
save
it
from
the
enemy
hands
true
to
the
fears
of
his
holiness
on
september
the
italian
troops
after
a
five
bombardment
entered
rome
but
fortunately
no
serious
attack
was
made
upon
the
vatican
while
the
treasure
removed
has
remained
here
ever
since
cardinal
sannini
was
it
appears
a
traitor
to
the
church
for
although
he
induced
pio
nono
to
allow
the
treasure
to
be
removed
in
secret
he
never
told
him
the
exact
spot
where
it
was
concealed
and
curiously
enough
the
two
members
of
the
swiss
guard
who
had
assisted
the
cardinal
and
alone
knew
the
secret
both
disappeared
in
all
probability
i
believe
precipitated
into
that
subterranean
river
we
have
just
crossed
originally
the
small
entrance
to
these
galleries
was
only
hidden
by
brambles
but
directly
after
the
treasure
had
been
safely
secreted
his
eminence
the
cardinal
suddenly
discovered
that
the
spot
on
the
was
well
adapted
for
a
hermitage
and
he
built
the
present
hut
over
the
small
opening
in
the
rock
in
order
to
conceal
it
having
first
closed
the
hole
with
his
own
hands
so
that
the
should
not
discover
the
entrance
for
many
months
during
the
struggle
between
the
italian
government
and
the
holy
see
he
doffed
the
purple
and
lived
in
the
cell
a
hermit
but
in
reality
guarding
the
enormous
treasure
he
had
so
cleverly
secured
but
as
you
know
he
was
captured
by
the
terrible
poldo
pensi
dreaded
down
in
calabria
and
was
compelled
in
order
to
save
his
life
and
reputation
to
betray
the
existence
of
his
hoard
upon
this
pensi
came
here
in
secret
saw
the
treasure
but
being
extremely
superstitious
as
are
all
his
class
he
dare
not
touch
one
single
object
a
man
who
had
once
served
in
his
band
and
who
had
entered
our
monastery
a
certain
fra
orazio
he
sought
out
and
to
him
gave
the
hermitage
without
however
telling
him
of
the
secret
tunnel
and
caves
beneath
both
sannini
and
the
pope
died
but
fra
orazio
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
he
resided
over
a
veritable
mine
of
wealth
continued
here
sixteen
years
until
he
died
and
i
succeeded
him
in
the
occupancy
of
the
cell
spending
nearly
six
months
each
year
here
in
meditation
and
prayer
in
the
meantime
however
the
secret
of
his
eminence
inscribed
in
the
secret
cipher
used
by
the
vatican
in
the
seventeenth
century
seems
to
have
passed
through
poldo
pensi
into
the
hands
of
burton
blair
his
shipmate
and
intimate
friend
the
first
i
knew
of
it
was
about
five
years
ago
when
one
day
my
peace
was
disturbed
by
a
visit
from
two
englishmen
blair
and
dawson
they
told
me
a
story
of
the
secret
being
given
to
them
but
at
first
i
would
not
believe
that
there
was
any
truth
in
the
hidden
hoard
we
however
investigated
and
after
a
very
long
difficult
and
perilous
search
we
succeeded
in
revealing
the
truth
then
dawson
shared
in
the
secret
as
well
as
in
the
profits
i
remarked
astounded
at
the
amazing
truth
yes
the
three
of
us
alone
knew
the
secret
and
it
was
then
mutually
arranged
that
it
having
been
given
by
the
repentant
brigand
to
blair
he
was
entitled
to
the
greater
share
while
dawson
to
whom
pensi
had
apparently
spoken
before
his
death
concerning
the
treasure
and
who
had
been
in
possession
of
certain
facts
should
be
allotted
one
quarter
of
the
annual
and
to
myself
appointed
guardian
of
the
one
eighth
to
be
paid
not
to
myself
direct
as
that
would
arouse
suspicion
but
by
blair
bankers
in
london
to
the
of
the
order
of
the
capuchins
at
rome
through
five
years
this
arrangement
has
been
carried
out
once
every
six
months
we
entered
this
chamber
in
company
and
selected
a
certain
amount
of
gems
and
other
articles
of
value
which
were
sent
by
certain
channels
the
gems
to
amsterdam
for
sale
and
the
other
articles
to
the
great
of
paris
brussels
and
london
and
others
into
the
hands
of
renowned
dealers
in
antiques
as
you
may
see
for
yourself
this
collection
of
gems
is
almost
inexhaustible
three
rubies
alone
fetched
thousand
pounds
in
paris
last
year
while
some
of
the
emeralds
have
realised
enormous
sums
yet
so
ingeniously
did
the
signori
dawson
and
blair
arrange
the
channels
by
which
they
were
placed
upon
the
market
that
none
ever
guessed
the
truth
but
all
this
is
strictly
speaking
the
property
of
the
church
of
rome
remarked
reggie
no
answered
the
big
monk
in
his
broken
english
according
to
cardinal
sannini
his
holiness
after
the
peace
with
italy
made
a
free
gift
to
him
of
the
whole
of
it
as
a
mark
of
regard
and
knowing
too
that
with
rome
in
the
occupation
of
the
italian
troops
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
the
great
collection
of
jewels
back
again
into
the
treasury
without
exciting
suspicion
then
all
this
is
mine
i
exclaimed
even
then
unable
to
fully
realise
the
truth
all
answered
the
monk
except
the
share
to
me
or
rather
to
my
order
for
distribution
to
the
poor
as
payment
for
its
guardianship
and
that
to
the
signor
dawson
with
i
suppose
and
he
turned
towards
reggie
some
acknowledgment
to
your
friend
i
warned
you
against
him
once
he
added
but
it
was
owing
to
what
dawson
told
me
lies
i
have
already
pledged
myself
to
continue
to
act
towards
your
order
as
burton
blair
has
done
i
replied
as
to
dawson
that
is
another
matter
but
certainly
my
friend
seton
here
will
not
be
forgotten
nor
you
personally
as
the
faithful
holder
of
the
secret
any
reward
of
mine
goes
to
my
order
was
the
manly
fellow
quiet
reply
we
are
forbidden
to
possess
money
our
small
personal
wants
being
supplied
by
the
father
superior
and
of
this
world
riches
we
desire
none
save
that
necessary
to
relieve
the
poor
and
afflicted
you
shall
have
some
for
that
purpose
never
fear
i
laughed
then
as
the
air
exhausted
by
the
lights
seemed
to
grow
more
foul
we
decided
to
return
to
the
cell
so
cunningly
constructed
at
the
mouth
of
the
narrow
outer
gallery
we
had
reached
the
brink
of
that
terrible
abyss
where
the
black
flood
roared
deep
below
and
i
had
passed
over
the
narrow
and
gained
the
opposite
side
safely
when
without
warning
a
pair
of
strong
hands
seized
me
in
the
darkness
and
almost
ere
i
could
utter
a
cry
i
was
forced
backwards
to
the
edge
of
the
awful
chasm
the
hands
held
me
in
an
iron
grip
by
the
throat
and
arm
and
so
suddenly
had
i
been
seized
that
for
the
first
instant
i
believed
it
to
be
a
joke
on
reggie
part
for
he
was
fond
of
horseplay
when
in
jubilant
spirits
my
god
i
however
heard
him
cry
a
second
later
as
i
suppose
the
flickering
lamplight
fell
upon
my
assailant
countenance
why
dawson
knowledge
of
the
terrible
truth
that
i
had
been
seized
by
my
worst
enemy
who
had
followed
us
in
well
knowing
the
place
aroused
within
me
a
superhuman
strength
and
i
grappled
with
the
fellow
in
a
fierce
death
struggle
ere
my
two
companions
could
reach
and
rescue
me
we
were
swaying
to
and
fro
in
the
darkness
on
the
very
edge
of
the
abyss
into
which
it
was
his
intention
to
hurl
me
to
the
same
death
that
the
two
swiss
guards
had
probably
been
consigned
by
the
wily
cardinal
i
realised
his
murderous
intention
none
too
quickly
for
with
a
fierce
oath
he
panted
you
escape
me
now
that
blow
in
the
fog
did
have
the
desired
effect
but
once
down
there
you
never
intrude
again
upon
my
affairs
down
you
go
i
felt
my
strength
fail
me
as
he
forced
me
back
still
further
locked
in
his
deadly
embrace
in
the
darkness
one
of
my
companions
gripped
me
and
saved
me
but
at
that
instant
i
had
recourse
to
an
old
charterhouse
trick
and
twisting
suddenly
so
that
my
opponent
stood
in
my
place
i
tripped
him
backwards
at
the
same
moment
slipping
from
his
grasp
it
was
the
work
of
a
second
in
the
uncertain
glimmer
from
the
lamp
i
saw
him
stumble
clutch
wildly
at
the
air
and
with
an
awful
cry
of
rage
and
despair
he
fell
backwards
down
into
the
stygian
blackness
where
the
rushing
waters
swept
him
down
to
subterranean
regions
unknown
and
unexplored
my
escape
from
death
was
assuredly
the
narrowest
man
had
ever
had
and
i
stood
panting
breathless
bewildered
until
reggie
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
forward
in
silence
more
impressive
than
any
words
chapter
thirty
the
motive
and
the
moral
on
the
following
night
we
took
leave
of
the
strong
monk
on
the
railway
platform
in
lucca
and
entered
the
train
on
the
first
stage
of
our
journey
back
to
england
he
was
to
return
at
once
to
his
hermit
cell
above
the
swirling
serchio
and
remain
as
before
the
silent
guardian
of
that
great
secret
which
had
it
been
revealed
would
have
astounded
the
world
anxiety
consumed
us
knowing
not
how
mabel
had
fared
yet
with
the
knowledge
that
the
baneful
influence
of
the
adventurer
dawson
had
been
now
removed
we
returned
home
somewhat
easier
in
mind
i
was
wealthy
it
was
true
rich
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
yet
the
hope
of
the
possession
of
mabel
as
my
wife
that
had
been
the
mainspring
of
my
life
had
been
snapped
and
in
those
pensive
hours
as
the
express
tore
northward
across
the
plains
of
lombardy
and
through
switzerland
and
france
my
despairing
thoughts
were
all
of
her
and
of
her
future
a
cab
took
us
direct
from
charing
cross
to
great
russell
street
where
i
found
a
note
from
her
dated
from
grosvenor
square
asking
me
to
call
there
on
the
instant
of
our
return
this
i
did
after
a
hasty
wash
and
carter
showed
me
unceremoniously
and
at
once
up
to
that
big
so
familiar
to
me
in
a
few
moments
she
entered
looking
sweet
and
charming
in
her
mourning
a
smile
upon
her
lips
her
hand
extended
to
me
in
glad
welcome
her
face
i
thought
betrayed
a
keen
anxiety
and
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
showed
how
sorely
her
heart
was
torn
by
grief
and
terror
yes
mabel
i
am
back
again
i
said
holding
her
hand
and
gazing
into
her
eyes
i
have
discovered
your
father
secret
what
she
cried
in
eager
surprise
you
have
tell
me
what
it
is
do
tell
me
she
urged
breathlessly
i
first
obtained
from
her
a
promise
of
secrecy
and
then
standing
with
her
i
described
our
visit
to
the
lonely
hermit
cell
our
reception
by
the
monk
antonio
and
our
subsequent
discoveries
she
listened
in
blank
amazement
at
my
story
of
the
hidden
treasure
of
the
vatican
until
i
described
the
attack
made
upon
me
by
dawson
and
its
tragic
sequel
whereupon
she
cried
then
if
that
man
is
dead
actually
dead
i
am
free
how
explain
i
demanded
well
now
that
circumstances
have
combined
to
thus
liberate
me
i
will
confess
to
you
she
responded
after
a
brief
pause
her
face
had
suddenly
flushed
and
glancing
across
at
the
door
she
first
reassured
herself
that
it
was
closed
then
in
a
deep
intense
voice
she
said
looking
straight
into
my
face
with
those
wonderful
eyes
of
hers
i
have
been
the
victim
of
a
foul
base
plot
which
i
will
explain
so
that
knowing
the
whole
truth
you
may
be
able
to
judge
how
i
have
suffered
and
whether
i
have
not
acted
from
a
sense
of
right
and
duty
for
devilish
cunning
and
ingenuity
the
conspiracy
against
me
surely
has
no
equal
as
you
will
see
i
have
only
now
succeeded
in
discovering
the
real
truth
and
the
deep
hidden
motive
behind
it
all
my
first
meeting
with
herbert
hales
was
apparently
accidental
in
widemarsh
street
hereford
i
was
only
a
girl
just
finishing
my
schooldays
and
as
full
of
romantic
ideas
concerning
men
as
all
girls
are
i
saw
him
often
and
although
i
knew
that
he
picked
up
a
precarious
living
on
i
allowed
him
to
court
me
at
first
i
confess
that
i
fell
deeply
in
love
with
him
a
fact
which
he
did
not
fail
to
detect
and
during
that
summer
at
mayvill
i
met
him
secretly
on
many
evenings
in
the
park
after
we
had
thus
been
acquainted
about
three
months
he
one
night
suggested
that
we
should
marry
but
by
that
time
having
detected
that
his
love
for
me
was
only
feigned
i
refused
evening
after
evening
we
met
but
i
steadfastly
declined
to
marry
him
until
one
night
he
showed
himself
in
his
true
colours
for
to
my
abject
amazement
he
told
me
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
my
father
and
further
he
alleged
that
there
was
one
dark
incident
connected
with
it
namely
that
my
father
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
the
secret
by
which
he
had
gained
his
wealth
had
murdered
the
italian
seaman
pensi
on
board
the
off
the
spanish
coast
i
refused
to
hear
such
a
terrible
allegation
but
to
my
surprise
he
caused
me
to
meet
my
father
friend
the
man
dawson
by
appointment
and
the
declared
that
he
was
the
actual
witness
of
my
father
crime
when
we
were
alone
that
same
night
as
we
walked
by
a
bypath
across
the
park
he
put
his
intentions
to
me
plainly
namely
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
accept
him
as
my
husband
and
marry
him
is
secret
against
my
father
knowledge
otherwise
he
would
give
information
to
the
police
regarding
the
allegation
against
my
father
the
blackguard
i
cried
continuing
she
said
he
pointed
out
how
dawson
my
father
closest
friend
was
the
actual
witness
and
so
completely
did
i
find
myself
and
my
father
reputation
in
his
unscrupulous
hands
that
i
was
compelled
after
a
week
of
vain
resistance
to
accept
his
condition
of
secrecy
and
consent
to
the
odious
marriage
from
that
moment
although
i
returned
home
the
instant
we
were
made
man
and
wife
i
was
completely
in
his
power
and
had
to
pay
blackmail
to
him
at
every
demand
after
he
had
secured
me
as
his
victim
his
true
passionate
instincts
those
of
a
man
who
lived
by
his
wits
and
to
whom
a
woman
heart
was
of
no
account
were
almost
instantly
revealed
and
from
that
moment
until
the
present
although
believed
to
be
a
single
girl
and
chaperoned
to
all
sorts
of
functions
in
the
brightest
set
in
london
yet
i
lived
in
mortal
terror
of
the
man
who
was
by
law
my
husband
she
paused
to
gain
breath
and
i
saw
that
her
lips
were
white
and
that
she
was
trembling
fortunately
she
went
on
at
last
you
were
able
to
rescue
me
otherwise
the
plot
would
have
been
successful
in
every
particular
until
yesterday
i
was
entirely
unaware
of
the
real
motive
of
forcing
me
into
that
marriage
but
now
it
is
revealed
i
can
see
the
deep
cunning
of
the
master
mind
that
planned
it
herbert
hales
it
seems
first
sought
me
out
because
of
a
chance
remark
of
old
hales
regarding
my
great
and
mysterious
fortune
an
adventurer
he
saw
that
he
might
contract
marriage
with
myself
as
heiress
to
my
father
possessions
when
we
had
been
acquainted
about
a
month
dawson
chanced
to
be
over
from
italy
staying
with
us
at
mayvill
for
a
few
days
and
one
evening
while
out
shooting
wood
pigeons
he
discovered
us
walking
together
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
skirting
the
park
the
instant
he
saw
us
he
formed
a
devilish
design
and
next
day
set
about
making
inquiries
regarding
hales
and
ascertaining
the
character
of
the
man
met
him
and
made
a
curious
compact
with
him
to
the
effect
that
if
he
dawson
so
arranged
matters
that
a
secret
marriage
was
contracted
between
myself
and
hales
the
latter
was
in
the
case
of
my
father
death
to
receive
the
sum
of
two
thousand
a
year
in
lieu
of
any
claim
against
the
estate
on
his
wife
behalf
he
pointed
out
to
hales
that
by
a
secret
marriage
with
me
he
would
obtain
a
source
of
continual
revenue
as
i
dare
not
refuse
his
demands
for
money
because
if
i
on
my
part
exposed
the
secret
of
our
union
he
could
at
once
take
up
his
correct
position
as
the
husband
of
the
millionaire
daughter
this
having
been
arranged
he
told
hales
many
true
facts
concerning
my
father
life
at
sea
in
order
to
mislead
me
but
added
an
allegation
which
being
corroborated
by
himself
i
unfortunately
believed
to
be
true
that
my
father
had
committed
murder
in
order
to
obtain
that
little
pack
of
cards
with
the
cipher
upon
them
dawson
who
had
quickly
judged
the
character
of
hales
secretly
aided
him
to
get
me
completely
in
his
power
although
of
course
i
was
entirely
unaware
of
it
his
motive
in
securing
my
marriage
in
such
compulsory
circumstances
was
a
one
for
he
recognised
that
had
i
married
the
man
i
loved
my
husband
would
on
my
father
death
see
that
my
rights
as
heiress
were
properly
established
while
if
on
the
other
hand
i
were
hales
wife
afraid
to
acknowledge
my
matrimonial
and
hales
was
by
the
compact
entirely
in
his
power
he
would
in
the
end
obtain
complete
possession
of
my
father
money
he
knew
of
course
that
his
position
as
one
of
the
holders
of
the
secret
of
the
vatican
treasure
as
it
now
turns
out
to
be
made
it
imperative
for
my
father
to
leave
the
management
of
my
affairs
in
his
hands
and
therefore
he
took
every
precaution
to
secure
complete
possession
upon
my
poor
father
death
the
ingenious
manner
in
which
he
secretly
placed
herbert
hales
in
possession
of
certain
facts
which
i
believed
were
only
known
to
my
father
and
myself
the
subtle
manner
in
which
he
corroborated
his
own
untruth
alleging
that
my
father
was
guilty
of
a
crime
and
the
secrecy
with
which
he
aided
hales
to
marry
me
under
sheer
compulsion
were
i
can
now
see
marvels
of
clever
conspiracy
i
feared
nay
i
felt
convinced
all
along
that
the
terrible
secret
of
my
father
as
known
to
hales
was
the
awful
truth
and
it
is
only
yesterday
that
with
the
aid
of
old
hales
i
succeeded
in
discovering
in
a
back
street
in
grimsby
a
man
named
palmer
who
was
seaman
on
board
the
and
present
at
the
italian
death
he
tells
me
that
the
allegation
against
my
father
is
absolutely
false
and
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
the
man
best
and
kindest
friend
and
in
acknowledgment
of
this
the
italian
gave
him
the
little
chamois
leather
bag
containing
the
cards
my
fears
as
to
the
secret
having
been
obtained
by
foul
play
are
therefore
entirely
set
at
rest
and
the
stain
removed
from
my
poor
father
memory
but
the
mode
of
your
father
death
i
said
amazed
at
this
remarkable
revelation
of
craft
and
deception
ah
she
sighed
my
opinion
has
altered
he
died
from
natural
causes
just
at
a
moment
when
a
secret
attempt
was
to
be
made
to
assassinate
him
by
that
same
train
up
to
manchester
herbert
hales
who
was
of
course
unknown
to
my
father
and
the
man
dawson
travelled
in
company
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
their
intention
if
opportunity
was
afforded
to
strike
a
blow
with
the
same
fatal
knife
with
which
the
attempt
was
later
made
upon
you
death
however
cheated
them
of
their
victim
but
this
villainous
scoundrel
who
is
your
husband
what
of
him
the
judgment
of
heaven
has
already
fallen
upon
him
was
her
low
almost
mechanical
answer
what
i
gasped
eagerly
is
he
dead
he
quarrelled
here
with
dawson
on
the
night
you
left
london
and
again
the
man
exhibited
that
remarkable
craft
he
possessed
for
in
order
to
rid
himself
of
hales
and
the
ugly
facts
of
which
he
was
in
possession
he
appears
to
have
given
confidential
information
to
the
police
of
a
certain
robbery
committed
about
a
year
ago
after
kempton
park
races
in
which
the
man
from
whom
a
large
sum
of
money
was
stolen
was
so
severely
injured
that
he
died
two
detectives
went
to
lodgings
in
lower
seymour
street
about
two
in
the
morning
they
demanded
admittance
to
his
room
but
he
realising
that
dawson
had
carried
out
his
threat
and
that
the
truth
was
out
barricaded
himself
in
when
they
at
last
forced
the
door
they
found
him
stretched
dead
upon
the
floor
with
a
revolver
lying
beside
him
then
you
are
free
mabel
free
to
marry
me
i
cried
almost
beside
myself
with
joy
she
hung
her
head
and
answered
in
a
tone
so
low
that
i
could
hardly
catch
the
words
no
i
am
unworthy
gilbert
i
deceived
you
the
past
is
past
and
all
forgotten
i
exclaimed
snatching
up
her
hand
and
bending
until
my
hot
passionate
lips
touched
hers
you
are
mine
mabel
mine
alone
i
cried
that
is
of
course
if
you
dare
to
trust
your
future
in
my
hands
dare
she
echoed
smiling
through
the
tears
which
filled
her
eyes
have
i
not
trusted
you
these
past
five
years
have
you
not
indeed
been
always
my
best
friend
from
that
night
when
we
first
met
until
this
moment
but
have
you
sufficient
regard
for
me
dearest
i
asked
deeply
touched
by
her
words
i
mean
do
you
love
me
i
do
gilbert
she
faltered
with
eyes
downcast
in
modesty
i
have
loved
no
man
except
yourself
then
i
clasped
her
to
me
and
in
those
moments
of
my
ecstasy
i
repeated
to
my
love
the
tale
the
tale
that
every
man
the
world
over
tells
the
woman
before
whom
he
bows
in
adoration
and
what
more
need
i
say
a
delicious
sense
of
possession
thrilled
my
heart
she
was
mine
mine
for
ever
i
was
convinced
that
in
those
terrible
sufferings
through
which
she
had
passed
she
had
been
always
loyal
and
true
to
me
she
had
poor
girl
like
her
father
been
the
innocent
victim
of
the
ingenious
adventurer
dawson
and
the
unscrupulous
young
blackguard
who
was
his
tool
and
who
had
inveigled
her
into
marriage
in
order
to
subsequently
possess
themselves
of
the
whole
of
blair
gigantic
fortune
the
wheel
of
fortune
however
ran
back
upon
them
and
instead
of
success
their
own
avarice
and
ingenuity
resulted
in
their
defeat
and
at
the
same
time
placed
me
in
the
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
chapter
thirty
one
conclusion
mabel
and
i
are
now
man
and
wife
and
surely
no
couple
in
london
are
as
perfectly
happy
as
we
are
to
us
after
the
storms
and
stress
of
life
has
come
a
calm
and
blissful
peace
the
faithful
ford
is
back
as
my
secretary
while
we
frequently
chaff
reggie
who
has
sold
his
lace
business
about
his
profound
admiration
of
dolly
dawson
who
even
though
the
daughter
of
an
adventurer
is
i
am
compelled
to
admit
a
modest
and
most
charming
girl
who
would
i
feel
sure
make
my
old
chum
an
excellent
indeed
the
other
day
he
inquired
in
strict
confidence
of
percival
who
has
apartments
with
us
at
mayvill
whether
she
thought
mabel
would
take
it
ill
were
he
to
propose
therefore
his
ideas
are
evidently
now
running
in
the
direction
of
matrimony
old
hales
still
lives
at
the
crossway
at
owston
and
recently
came
with
his
wife
to
london
to
visit
us
as
regards
the
cardinal
secret
no
word
of
it
has
ever
leaked
out
to
the
public
it
being
far
too
carefully
guarded
by
us
over
the
entrance
to
that
great
storehouse
of
wealth
the
grave
monk
in
the
frayed
habit
fra
antonio
the
friend
of
the
poor
of
lucca
still
lives
dividing
his
lonely
life
between
solitary
meditation
and
attending
to
the
wants
of
the
destitute
in
that
crowded
city
away
down
the
green
valley
the
church
of
rome
has
a
long
memory
for
years
it
seems
active
steps
have
been
in
progress
to
search
and
recover
the
great
treasure
given
by
pius
ix
to
his
favourite
sannini
the
presence
in
london
of
the
cleric
monsignore
galli
of
rimini
and
his
clandestine
interview
with
dolly
was
according
to
her
own
avowal
in
order
to
ascertain
some
facts
regarding
her
father
recent
movements
it
being
known
that
he
had
a
few
months
before
sold
to
a
dealer
in
paris
the
historic
jewelled
crucifix
worn
by
clement
viii
which
was
placed
in
the
vatican
treasury
after
his
death
in
many
men
in
the
city
are
aware
of
the
great
fortune
that
has
come
to
me
and
you
yourself
are
perhaps
acquainted
with
the
white
exterior
of
one
house
in
grosvenor
square
yet
none
assuredly
know
the
strange
facts
which
i
have
here
for
the
first
time
put
on
record
a
month
ago
i
was
seated
in
that
silent
little
cell
which
so
cunningly
conceals
the
vast
wealth
of
which
i
am
now
possessor
and
which
has
placed
me
among
the
millionaires
of
england
and
in
relating
to
him
in
detail
mabel
tragic
story
of
how
cruelly
she
was
victimised
i
was
expressing
my
mind
freely
upon
the
dastardly
action
of
that
man
who
had
been
engulfed
in
the
subterranean
flood
when
the
kindly
monk
with
the
furrowed
face
raised
his
hand
and
pointing
to
the
great
crucifix
upon
the
wall
said
in
that
calm
voice
of
his
no
no
signor
greenwood
hatred
and
malice
should
not
rankle
in
the
heart
of
the
honest
man
rather
let
us
remember
those
divine
words
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
as
we
forgive
them
therefore
let
us
forgive
the
englishman
the
end
