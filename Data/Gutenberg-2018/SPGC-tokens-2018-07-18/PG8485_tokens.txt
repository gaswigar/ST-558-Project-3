books
fatal
to
their
authors
by
ditchfield
to
the
memory
of
john
walter
of
bearwood
berks
this
volume
is
respectfully
and
affectionately
dedicated
preface
to
the
record
the
woes
of
authors
and
to
de
libris
fatalibus
deliberately
to
court
the
displeasure
of
that
fickle
mistress
who
presides
over
the
destinies
of
writers
and
their
works
fortune
awaits
the
aspiring
scribe
with
many
wiles
and
oft
treats
him
sorely
if
she
enrich
any
it
is
but
to
make
them
subject
of
her
sport
if
she
raise
others
it
is
but
to
pleasure
herself
with
their
ruins
what
she
adorned
but
yesterday
is
her
pastime
and
if
we
now
permit
her
to
adorn
and
crown
us
we
must
suffer
her
to
crush
and
tear
us
to
pieces
her
sovereign
power
is
limited
she
can
but
let
loose
a
host
of
angry
critics
upon
us
she
can
but
scoff
at
us
take
away
our
literary
reputation
and
turn
away
the
eyes
of
a
public
as
fickle
as
herself
from
our
pages
surely
that
were
hard
enough
can
fortune
pluck
a
more
galling
dart
from
her
quiver
and
dip
the
point
in
more
envenomed
bitterness
yes
those
whose
hard
lot
is
here
recorded
have
suffered
more
terrible
wounds
than
these
they
have
lost
liberty
and
even
life
on
account
of
their
works
the
cherished
offspring
of
their
brains
have
like
unnatural
children
turned
against
their
parents
causing
them
to
be
put
to
many
of
them
nay
it
is
surprising
how
many
of
this
illustrious
family
have
peopled
the
world
and
they
can
boast
of
many
authors
names
which
figure
on
their
genealogical
tree
men
who
might
have
lived
happy
contented
and
useful
lives
were
it
not
for
their
insane
and
hereby
they
show
their
folly
if
only
they
had
been
content
to
write
plain
and
ordinary
commonplaces
which
every
one
believed
and
which
caused
every
honest
fellow
who
had
a
grain
of
sense
in
his
head
to
exclaim
how
true
that
is
all
would
have
been
well
but
they
must
needs
write
something
original
something
different
from
other
men
thoughts
and
immediately
the
censors
and
critics
began
to
spy
out
heresy
or
laxity
of
morals
and
the
fools
were
dealt
with
according
to
their
folly
there
used
to
be
special
houses
of
correction
in
those
days
built
upon
an
approved
system
for
the
special
treatment
of
cases
of
this
kind
mediaeval
dungeons
an
occasional
application
of
the
rack
and
other
gentle
instruments
of
torture
of
an
inventive
age
were
wonderfully
efficacious
in
curing
a
man
of
his
folly
nor
was
there
any
special
limit
to
the
time
during
which
the
treatment
lasted
and
in
case
of
a
dangerous
fit
of
folly
there
were
always
a
few
faggots
ready
or
a
sharpened
axe
to
put
a
finishing
stroke
to
other
and
more
gentle
species
of
folly
was
especially
effective
in
procuring
the
attention
of
the
critics
of
the
day
and
that
was
satirical
writing
they
could
not
tolerate
that
style
no
not
for
a
moment
and
many
an
author
has
had
his
cap
and
bells
aye
and
the
lining
too
severed
from
the
rest
of
his
motley
simply
because
he
would
go
and
play
with
satyrs
instead
of
keeping
company
with
plain
and
simple
separated
from
the
crowd
of
fools
save
only
in
their
fate
were
those
who
amid
the
mists
of
error
saw
the
light
of
truth
and
strove
to
tell
men
of
her
graces
and
perfections
the
vulgar
crowd
heeded
not
the
message
and
despised
the
messengers
they
could
see
no
difference
between
the
philosopher
robe
and
the
fool
motley
the
saint
glory
and
satan
hoof
but
with
eager
eyes
and
beating
hearts
the
toilers
after
truth
worked
how
many
with
sad
faith
have
sought
her
how
many
with
crossed
hands
have
sighed
for
her
how
many
with
brave
hearts
fought
for
her
at
life
dear
peril
wrought
for
her
so
loved
her
that
they
died
for
her
tasting
the
raptured
fleetness
of
her
divine
completeness
honour
of
these
scholars
of
an
elder
age
little
understood
by
their
fellows
who
caused
them
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
the
truth
they
loved
we
doff
our
caps
whether
they
jingle
or
not
as
you
please
and
if
thou
thinkest
good
reader
that
folly
to
lose
a
life
for
such
a
cause
the
bells
will
match
the
rest
of
thy
garb
the
learning
too
of
the
censors
and
critics
was
often
indeed
remarkable
they
condemned
a
recondite
treatise
on
trigonometry
because
they
imagined
it
contained
heretical
opinions
concerning
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
and
another
work
which
was
devoted
to
the
study
of
insects
was
prohibited
because
they
concluded
that
it
was
a
secret
attack
upon
the
jesuits
well
might
poor
galileo
exclaim
and
are
these
then
my
judges
stossius
who
wrote
a
goodly
book
with
the
title
concordia
rationis
et
fidei
which
was
duly
honoured
by
being
burnt
at
berlin
thus
addresses
his
slaughtered
offspring
and
speculates
on
the
reason
of
its
condemnation

about
to

all
the
race
of
fools
who
have
made
themselves
uncomfortable
through
their
insane
love
of
writing
nor
count
all
the
books
which
have
become
instruments
of

that

which

such

i
may

write
to

of
some
of
them
now
and
if
thou

require
more
some

i
may

thee
of
them
perhaps
in
a

of

wilt
collect
a

of
fatal
books
many
of
which
are
rare
and
hard
to
find
know
too
that
i
have
derived
some
of
the
titles
of
works
herein
recorded
from
a
singular
and
rare
work
of
john
christianus
klotz
published
in
latin
at
leipsic
in
the
year
to
these
i
have
added
many
others
the

a
mine
from
which
i
have
often
quarried
and
discovered
there
many
rare
treasures
our
own
learned
literary
historian
isaac
disraeli
has
recorded
the
woes
of
many
of
our
english
writers
in
his
book
entitled
the
calamities
of
authors
and
also
in
his
curiosities
of
literature
from
these
works
i
have
derived
some
information
there
is
a
work
by

another

lamp
weaving
from
their
brains
page
upon
page
of
lore
and
learning
wearing
their
lives
out
all
for
the
sake
of
an
ungrateful
public
which
cares
little
for

labour
and
scarcely
stops
to
thank
the
toiler
for
his
pains
if
there
be
any
of

pages
it
will
be
as
pleasant
to
you
to
feel
safe
and
free
from
the
stern

days
as
it
is
to
watch
the
storms

tempests
of
the
sea
from
the
secure
retreat
of
your
study
if
at
any
time
a
reviewer
should
treat
thy

book
with
scorn

to
ridicule
thy
sentiment

thy
folly

since
the
knowledge
of
truth
is
the
sovereign
good
of
human
nature
it
is
natural
that
in
every
age
she
should
have
many
seekers
and
those
who
ventured
in
quest
of
her
in
the
dark
days
of
ignorance
and
superstition
amidst
the
mists
and
tempests
of
the
sixteenth
century
often
ran
counter
to
the
opinions
of
dominant
parties
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
foes
who
knew
no
pity
inasmuch
as
theology
and
religion
are
the
highest
of
all
studies
the
they
have
attracted
the
most
powerful
minds
and
the
subtlest
intellects
to
their
elucidation
no
other
subjects
have
excited
men
minds
and
aroused
their
passions
as
these
have
done
on
account
of
their
unspeakable
importance
no
other
subjects
have
kindled
such
heat
and
strife
or
proved
themselves
more
fatal
to
many
of
the
authors
who
wrote
concerning
them
in
an
evil
hour
persecutions
were
resorted
to
to
force
consciences
roman
catholics
burning
and
torturing
protestants
and
the
latter
retaliating
and
using
the
same
weapons
surely
this
was
as
bacon
wrote
to
bring
down
the
holy
ghost
instead
of
the
likeness
of
a
dove
in
the
shape
of
a
vulture
or
raven
and
to
set
out
of
the
bark
of
a
christian
church
a
flag
of
a
bark
of
pirates
and
assassins
the
historian
then
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
by
far
the
larger
number
of
fatal
books
deal
with
these
subjects
of
theology
and
religion
and
many
of
them
belong
to
the
stormy
period
of
the
reformation
they
met
with
severe
critics
in
the
merciless
inquisition
and
sad
was
the
fate
of
a
luckless
author
who
found
himself
opposed
to
the
opinions
of
that
dread
tribunal
there
was
no
appeal
from
its
decisions
and
if
a
taint
of
heresy
or
of
what
it
was
pleased
to
call
heresy
was
detected
in
any
book
the
doom
of
its
author
was
sealed
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
age
was
exhausted
in
devising
methods
for
administering
the
largest
amount
of
torture
before
death
ended
his
woes
religio
potuit
suadere
liberty
of
conscience
was
a
thing
unknown
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
and
while
we
prize
that
liberty
as
a
priceless
possession
we
can
but
admire
the
constancy
and
courage
of
those
who
lived
in
less
happy
days
we
are
not
concerned
now
in
condemning
or
defending
their
opinions
or
their
beliefs
but
we
may
at
least
praise
their
boldness
and
mourn
their
fate
the
first
author
we
record
whose
works
proved
fatal
to
him
was
michael
molinos
a
spanish
theologian
born
in
a
pious
and
devout
man
who
resided
at
rome
and
acted
as
confessor
he
published
in
spiritual
which
was
translated
from
italian
into
latin
and
together
with
a
treatise
on
daily
was
printed
with
this
title
spiritual
manual
releasing
the
soul
and
leading
it
along
the
interior
way
to
the
acquiring
the
perfection
of
contemplation
and
the
rich
treasure
of
internal
in
the
preface
molinos
writes
mystical
theology
is
not
a
science
of
the
imagination
but
of
feelings
we
do
not
understand
it
by
study
but
we
receive
it
from
heaven
therefore
in
this
little
work
i
have
received
far
greater
assistance
from
the
infinite
goodness
of
god
who
has
deigned
to
inspire
me
than
from
the
thoughts
which
the
reading
of
books
has
suggested
to
me
the
object
of
the
work
is
to
teach
that
the
pious
mind
must
possess
quietude
in
order
to
attain
to
any
spiritual
progress
and
that
for
this
purpose
it
must
be
abstracted
from
visible
objects
and
thus
rendered
susceptible
of
heavenly
influence
this
work
received
the
approval
of
the
archbishop
of
the
kingdom
of
calabria
and
many
other
theologians
of
the
church
it
won
for
its
author
the
favour
of
cardinal
estraeus
and
also
of
pope
innocent
xi
it
was
examined
by
the
inquisition
at
the
instigation
of
the
jesuits
and
passed
that
trying
ordeal
unscathed
but
the
book
raised
up
many
powerful
adversaries
against
its
author
who
did
not
scruple
to
charge
molinos
with
judaism
mohammedanism
and
many
other
isms
but
without
any
avail
until
at
length
they
approached
the
confessor
of
the
king
of
naples
and
obtained
an
order
addressed
to
cardinal
estraeus
for
the
further
examination
of
the
book
the
cardinal
preferred
the
favour
of
the
king
to
his
private
friendship
molinos
was
tried
in
and
two
years
later
was
conducted
in
his
priestly
robes
to
the
temple
of
minerva
where
he
was
bound
and
holding
in
his
hand
a
wax
taper
was
compelled
to
renounce
articles
which
the
inquisition
decreed

leader
and

of

quietism
of

seventeenth

of

in
the
fourteenth
the
molinosists
madame
guyon
fénélon
and
others
in
the
seventeenth
century
all
belonged
to
that
contemplative
company
of
christians
who
thought
that
the
highest
state
of
perfection
consisted
in
the
repose
and
complete
inaction
of
the
soul
that
life
ought
to
be
one
of
entire
passive
contemplation
and
that
good
works
and
active
industry
were
only
fitting
for
those
who
were
toiling
in
a
lower
sphere
and
had
not
attained
to
the
higher
regions
of
spiritual
mysticism

contemplated
their
nose
or
their
navel

the
pious

spanish
divine
was
worthy
of
a
better
fate

perhaps
a
little
more

and
a
little
less
restlessness
would
not
be
amiss
in

busy
nineteenth
century
the
noblest
prey
ever
captured
by
those
keen
hunters
the
inquisitors
was
bartholomew
carranza
archbishop
of
toledo
in
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
prelates
in
christendom
he
enjoyed
the
favour
of
his
sovereign
philip
ii
of
spain
whom
he
accompanied
to
england
and
helped
to
burn
our
english
protestants
unfortunately
in
an
evil
hour
he
turned
to
authorship
and
published
a
catechism
under
this
title
sobre

on
account
of
this
work
he
was
accused
of
lutheranism
and
his
capture
arranged
by
his
enemies
at
midnight
after
the
archbishop
had
retired
to
rest
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
who
calls
asked
the
attendant
friar
open
to
the
holy
office
was
the
answer
immediately
the
door
flew
open
for
none
dared
resist
that
terrible
summons
and
ramirez
the
of
toledo
entered
the
archbishop
raised
himself
in
his
bed
and
demanded
the
reason
of
the
intrusion
an
order
for
his
arrest
was
produced
and
he
was
speedily
conveyed
to
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
at
valladolid
for
seven
long
years
he
lingered
there
and
was
then
summoned
to
rome
in
by
pius
and
imprisoned
for
six
years
in
the
castle
of
angelo
the
successor
of
pope
pius
gregory
at
length
pronounced
him
guilty
of
false
doctrine
his
catechism
was
condemned
he
was
compelled
to
abjure
sixteen
propositions
and
besides
other
penances
he
was
confined
for
five
years
in
a
monastery
broken
down
by
his
eighteen
years
imprisonment
and
by
the
hardships
he
had
undergone
he
died
sixteen
days
after
his
cruel
sentence
had
been
pronounced
footnote
cf
church
of
by
canon
meyrick
national
churches
series
on
his
deathbed
he
solemnly
declared
that
he
had
never
seriously
offended
with
regard
to
the
faith
the
people
were
very
indignant
against
his
persecutors
and
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
all
the
shops
were
closed
as
on
a
great
festival
his
body
was
honoured
as
that
of
a
saint
his
captors
doubtless
regretted
his
death
inasmuch
as
the
pope
is
said
to
have
received
a
thousand
gold
pieces
each
month
for
sparing
his
life
and
philip
appropriated
the
revenues
of
his
see
for
his
own
charitable
purposes
which
happened
at
that
time
to
be

in

by
the
usual
means
of

and

and

victims
a
very
fatal
book
was
one
entitled
de
anno
primitivo
ab
exordia
mundi
ad
annum
julianum
accommodato
et
de
sacrorum
temporum
ratione
folio
it
is
a
work
of
jerome
wecchiettus
a
florentine
doctor
of
theology
the
inquisition
attacked
and
condemned
the
book
to
the
flames
and
its
author
to
perpetual
imprisonment
being
absent
from
rome
he
was
comparatively
safe
but
surprised
the
whole
world
by
voluntarily
submitting
himself
to
his
persecutors
and
surrendering
himself
to
prison
this
extraordinary
humility
disarmed
his
foes
but
it
did
not
soften
much
the
hearts
of
the
inquisitors
who
permitted
him
to
end
his
days
in
the
cell
the
causes
of
the
condemnation
of
the
work
are
not
very
evident
one
idea
is
that
in
his
work
the
author
pretended
to
prove
that
christ
did
not
eat
the
passover
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
and
another
states
that
he
did
not
sufficiently
honour
the
memory
of
louis
of
bavaria
and
thus
aroused
the
anger
of
the
strong
supporters
of
that
ancient
house
the
first
english
author
whose
woes
we
record
is
samuel
clarke
who
was
born
at
norwich
in
and
was
for
some
time
chaplain
to
the
bishop
of
that
see
he
was
very
intimate
with
the
scientific
men
of
his
time
and
especially
with
newton
in
he
published
his
boyle
lectures
treatise
on
the
being
and
attributes
of
god
and
on
natural
and
revealed
which
found
its
way
into
other
lands
a
translation
being
published
in
amsterdam
in
our
author
became
chaplain
to
queen
anne
and
rector
of
james
he
was
a
profoundly
learned
and
devout
student
and
obtained
a
european
renown
as
a
true
christian
philosopher
in
controversy
he
encountered
foemen
worthy
of
his
steel
such
as
spinosa
hobbes
dodwell
collins
leibnitz
and
others
but
in
he
published
scriptural
doctrine
of
the
which
was
declared
to
be
opposed
to
the
christian
belief
and
tainted
with
arianism
the
attention
of
parliament
was
called
to
the
book
the
arguments
were
disputed
by
edward
wells
john
edwards
and
william
sommer
and
clarke
was
deprived
of
his
offices
the
charge
of
heterodoxy
was
certainly
never
proved
against
him
he
did
good
service
in
trying
to
stem
the
flood
of
rationalism
prevalent
in
his
time
and
his
work
was
carried
on
by
bishop
butler
his
correspondence
with
leibnitz
on
time
space
necessity
and
liberty
was
published
in
and
his
editions
of
caesar
and
homer
were
no
mean
contributions
to
the
study
of
classical
literature
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
lived
in
hungary
one
francis
david
a
man
learned
in
the
arts
and
languages
but
his
inconstancy
and
fickleness
of
mind
led
him
into
diverse
errors
and
brought
about
his
destruction
he
left
the
church
and
first
embraced
calvinism
then
he
fled
into
the
camp
of
the
party
publishing
a
book
christo
non
which
was
answered
by
faustus
socinus
the
founder
of
socinianism
the
prince
of
transylvania
christopher
bathori
condemned
david
as
an
impious
innovator
and
preacher
of
strange
doctrines
and
cast
him
into
prison
where
he
died
in
there
is
extant
a
letter
of
david
to
the
churches
of
poland
concerning
the
millennium
of
christ
our
next
author
was
a
victim
to
the
same
inconstancy
of
mind
which
proved
so
fatal
to
francis
david
but
sordid
reasons
and
the
love
of
gain
without
doubt
influenced
his
conduct
and
produced
his
fickleness
of
faith
antonio
de
dominis
archbishop
of
spalatro
was
a
shining
light
of
the
roman
church
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
he
was
born
in
and
educated
by
the
jesuits
he
was
learned
in
history
and
in
science
and
was
the
first
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
rainbow
his
explanation
being
adopted
and
perfected
by
descartes
the
jesuits
obtained
for
him
the
professorship
of
mathematics
at
padua
and
of
logic
and
rhetoric
at
brescia
after
his
ordination
he
became
a
popular
preacher
and
was
consecrated
bishop
of
segni
and
afterwards
archbishop
of
spalatro
in
dalmatia
he
took
a
leading
part
in
the
controversy
between
the
republic
of
venice
and
the
pope
and
after
the
reconciliation
between
the
two
parties
was
obliged
by
the
pope
to
pay
an
annual
pension
of
five
hundred
crowns
out
of
the
revenues
of
his
see
to
the
bishop
of
segni
this
highly
incensed
the
avaricious
prelate
who
immediately
began
to
look
out
for
himself
a
more
lucrative
piece
of
preferment
he
applied
to
sir
dudley
carleton
the
english
ambassador
at
venice
to
know
whether
he
would
be
received
into
the
church
of
england
as
the
abuses
and
corruptions
of
the
church
of
rome
prevented
him
from
remaining
any
longer
in
her
communion
king
james
heartily
approved
of
his
proposal
and
gave
him
a
most
honourable
reception
both
in
the
universities
and
at
court
all
the
english
bishops
agreed
to
contribute
towards
his
maintenance
fuller
says
it
is
incredible
what
flocking
of
people
there
was
to
behold
this
old
archbishop
now
a
new
convert
prelates
and
peers
presented
him
with
gifts
of
high
valuation
other
writers
of
the
period
describe
him
as
old
and
corpulent
but
of
a
comely
presence
irascible
and
pretentious
gifted
with
an
unlimited
assurance
and
plenty
of
ready
wit
in
writing
and
speaking
of
a
jeering
temper
and
of
a
most
grasping
avarice
he
was
ridiculed
on
the
stage
in
middleton
play
game
of
as
the
fat
bishop
he
was
well
named
de
dominis
in
the
plural
says
crakanthorp
for
he
could
serve
two
masters
or
twenty
if
they
paid
him
wages
our
author
now
proceeded
to
finish
his
great
work
which
he
published
in
in
three
large
folios
republicâ
of
which
the
original
still
exists
among
the
tanner
mss
in
the
bodleian
library
at
oxford
he
exclaims
says
fuller
reading
meditation
and
writing
i
am
almost
pined
away
but
his
fat
cheeks
did
confute
his
false
tongue
in
that
expression
in
this
book
he
shows
that
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
can
easily
be
disproved
from
holy
scripture
that
it
receives
no
support
from
the
judgment
of
history
and
antiquity
that
the
early
bishops
of
that
see
had
no
precedence
over
other
bishops
nor
were
in
the
least
able
to
control
those
of
other
countries
he
declares
that
the
inequality
in
power
amongst
the
apostles
is
a
human
invention
not
founded
on
the
gospels
that
in
the
holy
eucharist
the
priest
does
not
offer
the
sacrifice
of
christ
but
only
the
commemoration
of
that
sacrifice
that
the
church
has
no
coercive
power
that
john
huss
was
wrongfully
condemned
at
the
council
of
constance
that
the
holy
spirit
was
promised
to
the
whole
church
and
not
only
to
bishops
and
priests
that
the
papacy
is
a
fiction
invented
by
men
and
he
states
many
other
propositions
which
must
have
been
somewhat
distasteful
to
the
pope
and
his
followers
james
rewarded
de
dominis
by
conferring
on
him
the
mastership
of
the
savoy
and
the
deanery
of
windsor
and
he
further
increased
his
wealth
by
presenting
himself
to
the
rich
living
of
west
ilsley
in
berkshire
in
an
unfortunate
moment
he
insulted
count
gondomar
the
spanish
ambassador
who
determined
to
be
revenged
and
persuaded
the
pope
to
send
the
most
flattering
offers
if
he
would
return
to
his
former
faith

suddenly
after

the
archbishop
was
questioned
by
the
bishops
of
london
and
durham
by
order
of
the
king
with
regard
to
his
intentions
and
commanded
to
leave

twenty
days
he
was
known
to
have

and
a

his
hopes
were
doomed
to
be
disappointed
for
a
short
time
he
received
a
pension
from
gregory
but
this
was
discontinued
by
urban
and
our
author
became
dissatisfied
and
imprudently
talked
of
again
changing
his
faith
he
was
heard
to
exclaim
at
supper
on
one
occasion
that
no
catholic
had
answered
his
book
republicâ
but
that
he
himself
was
able
to
deal
with
them
the
inquisition
seized
him
and
he
was
conveyed
to
the
castle
of
angelo
where
he
soon
died
as
some
writers
assert
by
poison
his
body
and
his
books
were
burned
by
the
executioner
and
the
ashes
thrown
into
the
tiber
fitzgerald
rector
of
the
english
college
at

thus
describes
him
he
was
a
malcontent
knave
when
he
fled
from
us
a
railing
knave
when
he
lived
with
you
and
a
motley
particoloured
knave
now
he
is
come
again
he
had
undoubtedly
great
learning
and
skill
in
controversy
footnote
his
opinion
with

to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
metropolitan
over

bishops

referred
to
in

it
may
be

delighted
in
it
and
declared
that
the
book
was
for
him
and
for
all
kings
to
read
the
story
of
the
burning
of
the
translation
of

charitable
purpose
thereby
furnishing
tyndale
with
means
for
providing
another
edition
and
for
printing
his
translation
of
the
pentateuch
all
this
is
a
tale
nor
need
we
record
the
account
of
the
conspiracy
which
sealed
his
doom
for
sixteen
months
he
was
imprisoned
in
the
castle
of
vilvoord
and
we
find
him
petitioning
for
some
warm
clothing
and
for
a
candle
in
the
evening
for
it
is
wearisome
to
sit
alone
in
the
dark
and
above
all
for
his
hebrew
bible
grammar
and
dictionary
that
he
might
spend
his
time
in
that
study
after
a
long
dreary
mockery
of
a
trial
on
october
he
was
chained
to
a
stake
with
faggots
piled
around
him
as
he
stood
firmly
among
the
wood
with
the
executioner
ready
to
strangle
him
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
cried
with
a
fervent
zeal
and
loud
voice
open
the
king
of
england
eyes
and
then
yielding
himself
to
the
executioner
he
was
strangled
and
his
body
immediately
consumed
that
same
year
by
the
king
command
the
first
edition
of
the
bible
was
published
in
london
if
tyndale
had
confined
himself
to
the
great
work
of
translating
the
scriptures
and
had
abandoned
controversy
and
his
of
his
fate
might
have
been
different
but
as
froude
says
he
was
a
man
whose
history
has
been
lost
in
his
work
and
whose
epitaph
is
the
reformation
another
translator
whose
fate
was
not
so
tragic
was
the
learned
arias
montanus
a
spaniard
who
produced
at
the
command
of
king
philip
ii
the
famous
polyglot
bible
printed
at
antwerp
in
nine
tomes
he
possessed
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
several
languages
and
devoted
immense
labour
to
his
great
work
but
in
spite
of
the
royal
approval
of
his
work
his
book
met
with
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
extreme
roman
party
who
accused
him
to
the
pope
and
made
many
false
charges
against
him
the
pope
was
enraged
against
montanus
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
rome
to
plead
his
cause
he
at
length
obtained
pardon
from
the
pope
and
escaped
the
chariots
of
fire
which
bore
the
souls
of
so
many
martyred
saints
to
heaven
it
is
a
curious
irony
of
fate
that
montanus
who
was
one
of
the
chief
compilers
of
the
should
live
to
see
his
own
work
placed
on
the
condemned
list
the
story
of
the
martyrdom
of
john
huss
is
well
known
and
need
not
be
here
related
but
perhaps
the
books
which
caused
his
death
are
not
so
frequently
studied
or
their
titles
remembered
his
most
important
work
was
his
in
which
he
maintained
the
rigid
doctrine
of
predestination
denied
to
the
pope
the
title
of
head
of
the
church
declaring
that
the
pope
is
the
vicar
of
peter
if
he
walk
in
his
steps
but
if
he
give
in
to
covetousness
he
is
the
vicar
of
judas
iscariot
he
reprobates
the
flattery
which
was
commonly
used
towards
the
pope
and
denounces
the
luxury
and
other
corruptions
of
the
cardinals
besides
this
treatise
we
have
many
others
indulgentias
de
erectione
etc
he
wrote
in
latin
bohemian
and
german
and
recently
his
bohemian
writings
have
been
edited
by
erben
prague
his
plain
speaking
aroused
the
fury
of
his
adversaries
and
he
knew
his
danger
on
one
occasion
he
made
a
strange
challenge
offering
to
maintain
his
opinions
in
disputation
and
consenting
to
be
burnt
if
his
conclusions
were
proved
to
be
wrong
on
condition
that
his
opponents
should
submit
to
the
same
fate
in
case
of
defeat
but
as
they
would
only
sacrifice
one
out
of
the
company
of
his
foes
he
declared
that
the
conditions
were
unequal
and
the
challenge
was
abandoned
when
at
last
he
was
granted
a
safe
conduct
by
the
emperor
sigismund
and
trusted
himself
to
the
council
of
constance
his
fate
was
sealed
even
in
his
noisome
prison
his
pen
when
he
could
procure
one
was
not
idle
and
huss
composed
during
his
confinement
several
tracts
on
religious
subjects
at
length
his
degradation
was
completed
a
tall
paper
cap
painted
with
hideous
figures
of
devils
was
placed
upon
his
head
and
a
bishop
said
to
him
we
commit
thy
body
to
the
secular
arm
and
thy
soul
to
the
devil
and
i
replied
the
martyr
commit
it
to
my
most
merciful
lord
jesus
christ
when
on
his
way
to
execution
he
saw
his
fatal
books
being
burnt
amidst
an
excited
crowd
he
smiled
and
remarked
on
the
folly
of
people
burning
what
they
could
not
read

indeed

by

of

brought
into

from

propositions
taken
from

the
unreasonableness
and
injustice
of
this
condemnation
may
be
understood
from
the
following
extracts
proposition
it

in
vain
that
we
cry
to

my
if
it
is
not
the
spirit
of

that

this

offensive
to

ears
proposition
it
is
love
alone
that
speaks
to

it
is
love
alone
that
god
hears
this
according
to
the
cardinals
is
scandalous
temerarious
impious
and
erroneous
the
acceptance
of

was
a

to
many

further
france

the

unjustly
condemned

in

retired

right
of
succession
he
so
ably
defended

died
in

in
few
authors
have
received
greater
honour
for
their
works
or
endured
severer
calamities
on
account
of
them
than
the
famous
florentine
preacher
savonarola
endowed
with
a
marvellous
eloquence
imbued
with
a
spirit
of
enthusiastic
patriotism
and
intense
devotion
he
inveighed
against
the
vices
of
the
age
the
worldliness
of
the
clergy
the
selfish
ease
of
the
wealthy
while
the
poor
were

for

in
want
and
sickness
the
good
citizens
of

believed
that
he
was
an
angel
from

that
he
had
miraculous
powers
could
speak

foretell
the

a

the

very
small
and
must
have
taxed
the
skill
of
the

in
deciphering
it
the
austerity
of
his
teaching
excited
some
hostility
against
him
especially
on
the
part
of
the
monks
who
did
not
belong
to
his
order
that
of
the
dominicans
he
had
poured
such
bitter
invective
both
in
his
books
and
in
his
sermons
upon
the
vices
of
the
popes
and
the
cardinals
that
they
too
formed
a
powerful
party
in
league
against
him
in
addition
the
friends
of
the
medicis
resented
the
overthrow
of
their
power
and
the
populace
ever
fickle
in
their
affections
required
fresh
wonders
and
signs
to
keep
them
faithful
to
their
leader
the
opportunity
of
his
enemies
came
when
charles
viii
of
france
retired
from
florence
they
accused
savonarola
of
all
kinds
of
wickedness
he
was
cast
into
prison
tortured
and
condemned
to
death
as
a
heretic
in
what
his
heresy
consisted
it
were
hard
to
discover
it
was
true
that
when
his
poor
shattered
sensitive
frame
was
being
torn
and
rent
by
the
cruel
engines
of
torture
he
assented
to
many
things
which
his
persecutors
strove
to
wring
from
him
the
real
cause
of
his
destruction
was
not
so
much
the
charges
of
heresy
which
were
brought
against
his
books
and
sermons
as
the
fact
that
he
was
a
person
inconvenient
to
pope
alexander
vi
on
the
of
may
he
met
his
doom
in
the
great
piazza
at
florence
where
in
happier
days
he
had
held
the
multitude
by
his
burning
eloquence
there
sentence
was
passed
upon
him
stripped
of
his
black
dominican

was
bound
to
a
gibbet
strangled
by
a
halter
and
his
dead
body
consumed
by
fire
his
ashes
being
thrown
into
the
river

such
was
the
miserable
end
of
the
great
florentine
preacher
whose
strange
and
complex
character
has
been
so
often
discussed
and
whose
remarkable
career
has
furnished
a
theme
for
poets
and
and
forms
the
basis
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
novels
of
modern
times
not
only
were
the
inquisitors
and
the
cardinals
guilty
of
intolerance
and
the
stern
rigour
of
persecution
but
the
reformers
themselves
when
they
had
the
power
refrained
not
from
torturing
and
burning
those
who
did
not
accept
their
own
particular
belief
this
they
did
not
merely
out
of
a
spirit
of
revenge
conceived
against
those
who
had
formerly
condemned
their
fathers
and
brethren
to
the
stake
but
sometimes
we
see
instances
of
reformers
slaughtering
reformers
because
the
victims
did
not
hold
quite
the
same
tenets
as
those
who
were
in
power
poor
michael
servetus
shared
as
hard
a
fate
at
the
hands
of
calvin
as
ever
heretic
did
at
the
hands
of
the
catholics
and
this
fate
was
entirely
caused
by
his
writings
this
author
was
born
in
spain
at
villaneuva
in
arragon
in
at
an
early
age
he
went
to
africa
to
learn
arabic
and
on
his
return
settled
in
france
studying
law
at
toulouse
and
medicine
at
lyons
and
paris
but
the
principles
of
the
reformed
religion
attracted
him
he
studied
the
scriptures
in
their
original
languages
and
the
writings
of
the
fathers
and
schoolmen
unhappily
his
perverse
and
spirit
led
him
into
grievous
errors
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
in
vain
the
gentle
reformer
oecolampadius
at
basle
reasoned
with
him
he
must
needs
disseminate
his
opinions
in
a
book
entitled
trinitatis
which
has
handed
the
name
of
servetus
down
to
posterity
as
the
author
of
errors
opposed
to
the
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
bucer
declared
that
he
deserved
the
most
shameful
death
on
account
of
the
ideas
set
forth
in
this
work
in
his
next
work
on
the
and
treatise
on
the
kingdom
of
servetus
somewhat
modified
his
views
and
declared
that
his
former
reasonings
were
merely
those
of
a
boy
speaking
to
boys
but
he
blamed
rather
the
arrangement
of
his
book
than
retracted
the
opinions
he
had
expressed
he
also
annotated
pagnini
latin
version
of
the
sacred
scriptures
entitled
sacra
latina
ex
hebraeo
per
sanctum
pagninum
cum
praefatione

villanovani
michel
servet
lugduni
a
this
edition
was
vigorously
suppressed
on
account
of
the
notes
of
servetus
after
sojourning
some
time
in
italy
he
returned
to
france
in
and
settled
at
lyons
where
he
published
a
new
and
highly
esteemed
edition
of
the
geography
of
ptolemy
inscribing
himself
as
michael
villanovanus
from
the
name
of
his
birthplace
his
former
works
had
been
published
under
the
name
of
reves
formed
by
the
transposition
of
the
letters
of
his
family
name
in
paris
he
studied
medicine
and
began
to
set
forth
novel
opinions
which
led
him
into
conflict
with
other
members
of
the
faculty
in
one
of
his
treatises
he
is
said
to
have
suggested
the
theory
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
he
went
to
vienne
and
published
anonymously
his
work
restitutione
this
book
when
its
authorship
became
known
brought
upon
him
the
charge
of
heresy
and
he
was
cast
into
prison
powerful
friends
enabled
him
to
escape
and
his
enemies
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
burning
his
effigy
and
several
copies
of
his
books
in
the
at
vienne
servetus
determined
to
fly
to
naples
but
was
obliged
to
pass
through
geneva
where
at
the
instigation
of
the
great
reformer
calvin
he
was
seized
and
cast
into
prison
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
the
course
of
servetus
history
the
bitter
hostility
of
calvin
the
delays
the
trials
and
colloquies
at
length
he
was
condemned
and
the
religious
world
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
pile
lighted
by
a
champion
of
the
reformation
and
religious
freedom
loud
and
awful
shrieks
were
heard
in
the
prison
when
the
tidings
of
his
sentence
were
conveyed
to
servetus
soon
the
fatal
staff
was
broken
over
his
head
as
a
sign
of
his
condemnation
and
on
the
champel
hill
outside
the
gates
of
geneva
the
last
tragic
scene
took
place
with
his
brow
adorned
with
a
crown
of
straw
sprinkled
with
brimstone
his
fatal
books
at
his
side
chained
to
a
low
seat
and
surrounded
by
piles
of
blazing
faggots
the
newness
and
moisture
of
which
added
greatly
to
his
torture
in
piteous
agony
servetus
breathed
his
last
a
sad
spectacle
of
crime
wrought
in
religion
name
a
fearful
example
of
how
great
woes
an
author
may
bring
upon
himself
by
his
arrogance
and
the
errors
of
servetus
were
deplorable
but
the
vindictive
cruelty
of
his
foes
creates
sympathy
for
the
victim
of
their
rage
and
calvin
memory
is
ever
stained
by
his
base
conduct
to
his
former
friend
the
name
of
sebastian
edzardt
is
not
so
well
known
he
was
educated
at
würtemberg
and
when
frederick
of
prussia
conceived
the
desire
of
uniting
the
various
reformed
bodies
with
the
lutherans
he
published
a
work
causis
et
natura
and
a
treatise
calvanianorum
in
this
book
he
charged
the
calvinists
with
the
pelagian
heresy
a
charge
which
they
were
accustomed
to
bring
against
the
lutherans
it
was
written
partly
against
a
book
of
john
winckler
regium
de
conciliandis

subditorum
published
in
in
support
of

times
and
took
a

in
the
great
controversies
which
agitated
the
fourteenth
century

at

violent
oppressor

voices
were
raised

denouncing
the
assumptions
of
the
occupant
of
the
papal
see
marcilius
of
padua
wrote
his
famous
against
papal
pretensions
and
our
author
william
of
ockham
issued
his
still
more
famous
of
which
startled
the
whole
of
christendom
by
its
vigorous
onslaught
on
the
vices
of
the
papacy
and
the
assumptions
of
pope
john
the
latter
ordered
two
bishops
to
examine
the
work
and
the
invincible

was
cast
into

certainly

words

te

there
he
lived
and
wrote
condemned
by
the
pope
disowned
by
his
order
the
franciscans
threatened
daily
with
sentences
of
heresy
deprivation
and
imprisonment
but
for
them
he
cared
not
and
fearlessly
pursued
his
course
becoming
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the
reforming
tendencies
of
the
age
and
preparing
the
material
for
that
blaze
of
light
which
astonished
the
world
in
the
sixteenth
century
his
works
have
never
been
collected
and
are
very
scarce
being
preserved
with
great
care
in
some
of
the
chief
libraries
of
europe
the
scholastic
philosophy
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
disputes
between
the
nominalists
and
the
realists
in
which
he
took
the
part
of
the
former
the
principle
that
entities
are
not
to
be
multiplied
except
by
necessity
or
the
hypostatic
existence
of
abstractions
have
ceased
to
create
any
very
keen
interest
in
the
minds
of
readers
but
how
bitterly
the
war
of
words
was
waged
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
and
it
was
not
only
a
war
of
words
one
who
witnessed
the
contests
wrote
that
when
the
contending
parties
had
exhausted
their
stock
of
verbal
abuse
they
often
came
to
blows
and
it
was
not
uncommon
in
their
quarrels
about
to
see
the
combatants
engaged
not
only
with
their
fists
but
with
clubs
and
swords
so
that
many
have
been
wounded
and
some
killed
these
controversies
have
passed
away
upon
which
says
john
of
salisbury
more
time
had
been
wasted
than
the
caesars
had
employed

the
golden
haze
of

which
surrounded
him

loving
letters
have
been
often
read
and
mourned
over
by
thousands
who
have
never
heard

theological
writings
at

time
the
famous
canon
of
notre

at
paris
had
an
enthusiastic
following
thousands
flocked
to
his
lectures
from
every
country
his
popularity
was
enormous
he
combated
the
abuses
of
the
age
and
the
degeneracy
of
some
of
the
clergy
and
astonished
and
enraged
many
by
the
boldness
of
his
speech
and
the
novelty
of
his
opinions
his
views
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
expressed
in
his
traité
de
la
trinité
were
made
the
subject
of
a
charge
against
him
and
certainly
they
can
not
be
easily
distinguished
from
sabellianism
the
qualities

attributes
of
the
godhead
power

goodness

stated
to

to
instruct
us
by

jesus

god

is
not

a
man

not
properly
called

he
did
not
descend
into
hell
such
were
some
of
the
errors
with
which
abélard
was
reproached
whether
they
were
actually
contained
in
his
writings
it
is
not
so
evident
we
have
only
fragments
of
abélard
writings
to
judge
from
which
have
been
collected
by
cousin
inédits
and
therefore
can
not
speak
with
certain
knowledge
of
his
opinions
at
least
they
were
judged
to
be
blasphemous
and
heretical
by
the
council
of
soissons
when
he
was
condemned
to
commit
his
books
to
the
flames
and
to
retire
to
the
convent
of
denys
some
years
later
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
horrible
mutilation
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
by
the
uncle
of
heloise
and
his
mind
had
acquired
its
usual
strength

him

against

said
that
poor
abélard
was
an
infernal
dragon
who
persecuted
the
church
that
arius
pelagius

nestorius
were
not
more
dangerous
as
abélard
united
all
these
monsters
in
his
own
person
and
that
he
was
a
persecutor
of
the
faith
and
the
precursor
of

these
words
of
the
celebrated
abbot
of

the

of
old
were
curious
and
unhappy
beings
who
while
carelessly
strolling
amidst
sylvan
shades
caught
a
hasty
glimpse
of
some
spirit
of
the
woods
and
were
doomed
ever
afterwards
to
spend
their

in
fruitlessly
searching
after
it
the
race
of
fanatics
are
somewhat
akin
to
these
restless
seekers
there
is
a
wildness
and
excessive
extravagance
in
their
notions
and
actions
which
separates
them
from
the
calm
followers
of
truth
and
leads
them
into
strange
courses
and
curious
beliefs
how
far
the
sacred
fire
of
enthusiasm
may
be
separated
from
the
fierce
heat
of
fanaticism
we
need
not
now
inquire

a
spark
of
the
latter
has
not

brilliantly
in
many

produced

those
whose
fate
is
here
recorded
were
far
removed
from
such
noble
characters
their
fanaticism
was
akin
to
madness

of

were
fitter
for
an
asylum
rather
than

was
usually

was
quirinus
kulmanus
kuhlmann
who
has
been
called
the
prince
of

wandered
through
many

making
many
disciples
he
was
born
at

in

in

at
an
early
age
saw
strange
visions
at
one
time
the
devils
in

at
another
the
beatific
glory
of
god
his
native
country
did
not
appreciate
him
and
he
left
it
to
wander
on
from
university
to
university
publishing
his
ravings
at
leyden
he
met
with
the
works
of
boehme
another
fanatic
who
wrote
a
strange
book
entitled
which
was
suppressed
by
the
magistrates
the
reading
of
this
author
was
like
casting
oil
into
the
fire
poor
kuhlmann
became
wilder
still
in
his
strange
fanaticism
and
joined
himself
to
a
pretended
prophet
john
rothe
whom
the
authorities
at
amsterdam
incarcerated
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
foretell
with
greater
certainty
than
he
had
done
other
things
when
and
after
what
manner
he
should
be
released
kuhlmann
then
wrote
a
book
entitled
quinquennii
and
published
at
leyden
in
in
which
he
set
forth
his
peculiar
views
he
stated
that
in
that
same
year
the
fifth
monarchy
or
the
christian
kingdom
was
about
to
commence
that
he
himself
would
bring
forth
a
son
from
his
own
wife
that
this
son
by
many
miracles
would
found
the
kingdom
and
that
he
himself
was
the
son
of
god
on
account
of
these
mad
ravings
he
was
exiled
by
the
chief
of
the
united
provinces
of
the
netherlands
and
expelled
with
infamy
from
the
university
of
leyden
but
his
strange
mission
did
not
cease
he
wandered
for
some
time
in
france
and
england
where
he
printed
at
his
own
expense
several
small
books
in
and
amongst
others
one
piece
addressed
to
mahomet
conversione
the
following
passage
occurs
in
this
fantastic
production
you
saw
some
months
ago
o
great
eastern
leader
a
comet
of
unusual
magnitude
a
true
prognostic
of
the
kingdom
of
the
jesuelites
that
is
of
the
restoration
of
all
people
to
the
god
o
well
is
thee
that
thou
hast
turned
thy
mind
before
god
and
by
proclaiming
a
general
fast
throughout
thy
empire
hast
begun
to
fulfil
the
words
of
the
lord
to
the
prophet
drabicius
he
declares
that
if
the
christians
refuse
to
perform
his
will
in
destroying
the
kingdom
of
antichrist
the
turks
and
tartars
shall
do
it
to
the
disgrace
of
the
christians
which
will
be
a
horror
to
angels
and
to
men
he
then
proceeded
to
turkey
on
his
mission
and
presented
himself
to
the
sultan
although
ignorant
of
the
language
of
the
country
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
could
speak
in
any
tongue
but
when
they
led
him
into
the
presence
of
the
sultan
he
waited
in
vain
for
the
burning
words
of
eloquence
to
flow
the
turks
dealt
with
him
according
to
his
folly
and
bestowed
on
him
a
sound
thrashing
thence
he
proceeded
to
russia
and
when
he
was
about
to
marry
a
second
wife
his
former
spouse
being
left
in
england
the
patriarch
of
the
russian
church
condemned
him
to
be
burnt
at
moscow
in
a
follower
of
kuhlmann
named
nordermann
who
also
wrote
a
book
on
the
second
advent
of
christ
shared
his
fate
kuhlmann
also
wrote
a
volume
of
verses
entitled
berlin
and
amsterdam
at
the
gathering
of
lutherans
and
which
sufficiently
attests
his
insanity
the
following
is
a
specimen
of
the
lucidity
of
his
works
the
more
i
continued
my
doctrines
the
more
opposition
i
received
so
that
also
the
higher
world
of
light
with
which
i
am
illuminated
in
their
light
i
was
enlightened
or
shadowed
when
i
proceeded
and
in
their
light
lit
i
up
brighter
lights
a
fitting
companion
to
kuhlmann
was
john
tennhart
a
barber
of
nuremberg
born
in
who
used
to
speak
continually
of
the
visions
dreams
and
colloquies
which
he
had
with
god
and
boasted
that
the
office
of
a
scribe
was
entrusted
to
him
by
the
divine
will
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
all
men
that
the
words
he
wrote
were
verily
and
indeed
the
words
of
god
the
world
was
not
disposed
to
interfere
with
the
poor
barber
who
imagined
himself
inspired
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
published
a
book
against
the
priests
entitled
gottes
oder
tractätlein
an
den
so
genannten
geistlichen
which
caused
its
author
great
calamities
he
was
cast
into
prison
by
order
of
the
senate
of
the
nuremberg
state
on
his
release
he
again
published
his
former
work
with
others
which
he
also
believed
to
be
inspired
and
again
in
was
imprisoned
at
nuremberg
his
incarceration
did
not
however
last
long
and
tennhart
died
while
he
was
journeying
from
the
city
which
so
little
appreciated
his
ravings
to
find
in
cassel
a
more
secure
amongst
the
fanatics
of
the
seventeenth
century
may
be
classed
jeremiah
felbinger
a
native
of
brega
a
town
in
the
prussian
state
of
silesia
who
was
an
early
advocate
of
the
heresy
of
the
unitarians
for
some
years
he
was
a
soldier
and
then
became
a
schoolmaster
he
wrote
published
in
in
which
he
attempted
to
prove
his
unitarian
ideas
shortly
before
this
in
he
wrote
and
finally
his
ad
published
at
amsterdam
in
his
strange
views
and
perverted
opinions
first
caused
his
dismissal
from
the
army
and
his
works
upon
the
unitarian
doctrines
necessitated
his
removal
from
the
office
of
teacher
he
then
journeyed
to
helmstadt
but
there
the
wanderer
found
no
rest
for
when
he
tried
to
circulate
his
obnoxious
books
he
was
ordered
to
leave
the
city
before
sunset
finally
he
settled
in
amsterdam
the
home
of
where
men
were
allowed
a
large
amount
of
religious
liberty
there
printers
produced
without
let
or
hindrance
books
which
were
condemned
elsewhere
and
could
only
be
printed
in
secret
presses
and
obscure
corners
of
cities
governed
by
more
orthodox
rulers
here
felbinger
passed
the
rest
of
his
miserable
life
in
great
poverty
earning
a
scanty
pittance
by
instructing
youths
and
correcting
typographical
errors
he
died
in
aged
years
the
seventeenth
century
was
fruitful
in
fanatics
and
not
the
least
mad
was
simon
morin
who
was
burnt
at
paris
in
his
fatal
book
was
his
de
simon
paris
which
contains
a
curious
mixture
of
visions
and
nonsense
including
the
principal
errors
of
the
quietists
and
adding
many
of
his
own
amongst
other
mad
ravings
he
declared
that
there
would
be
very
shortly
a
general
reformation
of
the
church
and
that
all
nations
should
be
converted
to
the
true
faith
and
that
this
reformation
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
second
advent
of
our
lord
in
his
state
of
glory
incorporated
in
morin
himself
and
that
for
the
execution
of
the
things
to
which
he
was
destined
he
was
to
be
attended
by
a
great
number
of
perfect
souls
and
such
as
participated
in
the
glorious
state
of
jesus
christ
whom
he
therefore
called
the
champions
of
god
he
was
condemned
by
the
parliament
of
paris
and
after
having
done
penance
dressed
in
his
shirt
with
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
a
torch
in
his
hand
before
the
entrance
of
notre
dame
he
was
burnt
with
his
book
and
writings
his
ashes
being
subsequently
cast
into
the
air
morin
had
several
followers
who
shared
his
fantastic
views
and
these
poor
champions
of
god
were
condemned
to
witness
the
execution
of
their
leader
to
be
publicly
whipped
and
branded
with
the
mark
of
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
lives
as
poland
witnessed
the
burning
of
cazimir
liszinski
in
whose
ashes
were
placed
in
a
cannon
and
shot
into
the
air
this
polish
gentleman
was
accused
of
atheism
by
the
bishop
of
potsdam
his
condemnation
was
based
upon
certain
atheistical
manuscripts
found
in
his
possession
containing
several
novel
doctrines
such
as
god
is
not
the
creator
of
man
but
man
is
the
creator
of
a
god
gathered
together
from
nothing
his
writings
contain
many
other
extravagant
notions
of
the
same
kind
a
few
years
later
the
religious
world
of
both
england
and
ireland
was
excited
and
disturbed
by
the
famous
book
of
john
toland
a
sceptical
irishman
entitled
not
london
its
author
was
born
in
londonderry
in
and
was
endowed
with
much
natural
ability
but
this
did
not
avail
to
avert
the
calamities
which
pursue
indiscreet
and
reckless
writers
he
wrote
his
book
at
the
early
age
of
years
for
the
purpose
of
defending
holy
scripture
from
the
attacks
of
infidels
and
atheists
he
essayed
to
prove
that
there
was
nothing
in
religion
contrary
to
sound
reason
and
to
show
that
the
mysteries
of
religion
were
not
opposed
to
reason
but
his
work
aroused
much
opposition
both
in
england
and
ireland
as
there
were
many
statements
in
the
book
which
were
capable
of
a
rationalistic
interpretation
a
second
edition
was
published
in
london
with
an
apology
by
toland
in
in
dublin
he
raised
against
himself
a
storm
of
opposition
not
only
on
account
of
his
book
but
also
by
his
vain
and
foolish
manner
of
propagating
his
views
he
began
openly
to
deride
christianity
to
scoff
at
the
clergy
to
despise
the
worship
of
god
and
so
passed
his
life
that
whoever
associated
with
him
was
judged
to
be
an
impious
and
infamous
person
he
proposed
to
form
a
society
which
he
called
socratia
the
hymns
to
be
sung
by
the
members
were
the
odes
of
horace
and
the
prayers
were
blasphemous
productions
composed
by
toland
in
derision
of
those
used
in
the
roman
church
the
council
of
religion
of
the
irish
house
of
parliament
condemned
his
book
to
be
burnt
and
some
of
the
members
wished
to
imprison
its
author
who
after
enduring
many
privations
wisely
sought
safety
in
flight
a
host
of
writers
arrayed
themselves
in
opposition
to
toland
and
refuted
his
book
amongst
whom
were
john
norris
stillingfleet
payne
beverley
clarke
leibnitz
and
others
toland
wrote
also
life
of
london
which
was
directed
against
the
authenticity
of
the
new
testament
nazarene
or
christianity
judaic
pagan
and
and
the
outcry
raised
by
the
orthodox
party
against
the
poor
gentleman
who
had
to
beg
for
and
ran
into
debt
for
his
wigs
clothes
and
lodging
together
with
his
own
vanity
and
conceit
changed
him
from
being
a
somewhat
christian
into
an
infidel
and
atheist
or
pantheist
he
died
in
extreme
poverty
at
putney
in
a
fitting
companion
to
toland
was
thomas
woolston
who
lived
about
the
same
time
he
was
born
at
northampton
in
and
died
at
london
in
he
was
a
and
a
man
of
many
attainments
whose
works
became
widely
known
and
furnished
weapons
for
the
use
of
voltaire
and
other
atheistical
writers
in
he
wrote
a
book
entitled
old
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
show
that
in
the
interpretation
of
the
holy
scriptures
the
literal
meaning
ought
to
be
abandoned
and
that
the
events
recorded
therein
were
merely
allegories
in
his
book
gifts
to
the
he
denounced
all
who
favoured
the
literal
interpretation
as
apostates
and
ministers
of
antichrist
finally
in
his
on
the
he
denied
entirely
the
authenticity
of
miracles
and
stated
that
they
were
merely
stories
and
allegories
he
thought
that
the
literal
account
of
the
miracles
is
improbable
and
untrustworthy
that
they
were
parables
and
prophetical
recitations
these
and
many
other
doctrines
are
found
in
his
works
woolston
held
at
that
time
the
post
of
tutor
at
sidney
sussex
college
at
cambridge
but
on
account
of
his
works
he
was
expelled
from
the
college
and
cast
into
prison
according
to
one
account
of
his
life
he
died
in
prison
in
another
record
states
that
he
was
released
on
paying
a
fine
of
after
enduring
one
year
incarceration
and
that
he
bore
his
troubles
bravely
passing
an
honest
life
and
enduring
reproaches
with
an
equal
mind
not
a
few
able
theologians
set
themselves
the
task
of
refuting
the
errors
of
woolston
amongst
whom
were
john
ray
stebbins
bishop
of
davids
and
sherlock
whose
book
was
translated
into
french
a
of
has
been
written
anonymously
by
some
one
who
somewhat
favoured
his
views
and
supported
his
tenets
he
may
certainly
be
classed
among
the
leaders
of
free
thought
in
the
eighteenth
century
john
biddle
was
a
vehement
advocate
of
socinian
and
unitarian
opinions
attacking
the
belief
in
the
trinity
and
in
the
divinity
of
our
lord
the
holy
spirit
was
accounted
by
him
as
the
first
of
the
angels
his
fatal
book
was
entitled

god
who
is
only
the
father
and
of
one
mediator
between
god
and

this

imprisoned
biddle
was
born
at
in
he
went
to
oxford
and
became
a
teacher
at
a
at
gloucester
he
underwent
several
terms
of
imprisonment
on
account
of
the
opinions
expressed
in
his
writings
and
died
in
gaol
in
amongst
the
fanatics
whose
works
were
fatal
to
them
must
be
enrolled
the
famous
advocates
of
polygamy
johann
lyser
bernardino
ochino
and
samuel
friedrich
willenberg
lyser
was
born
at
leipsic
in
and
although
he
ever
remained
a
bachelor
and
abhorred
womankind
nevertheless
tried
to
demonstrate
that
not
only
was
polygamy
lawful
but
that
it
was
a
blessed
estate
commanded
by
god
he
first
brought
out
a
dialogue
written
in
the
vernacular
entitled
wahrenbergs
kurzes
gespraech
von
der
and
this
little
work
was
followed
by
a
second
book
koenigliche
marck
aller
freyburg
then
he
produced
another
work
entitled
aletaei
discursus
politicus
de
a
second
edition
of
this
work
followed
which
bore
the
title
triumphatrix
id
est
discursus
politicus
de
polygamia
auctore
theoph
aletoeo
cum
notis
athanasii
vincentii
omnibus
ubique
locorum
terrarum
insularum
pagorum
urbium
modeste
et
pie
opposita
londini
on
account
of
the
strange
views
expressed
in
this
work
he
was
deprived
of
his
office
of
inspector
and
was
obliged
to
seek
protection
from
a
powerful
count
by
whose
advice
it
is
said
that
lyser
first
undertook
the
advocacy
of
polygamy
on
the
death
of
his
friend
lyser
was
compelled
frequently
to
change
his
abode
and
wandered
through
most
of
the
provinces
of
germany
he
was
imprisoned
by
the
count
of
hanover
and
then
expelled
in
denmark
his
book
was
burned
by
the
public
executioner
at
another
place
he
was
imprisoned
and
beaten
and
his
books
burned
at
length
travelling
from
italy
to
holland
he
endured
every
kind
of
calamity
and
after
all
his
misfortunes
he
died
miserably
in
a
garret
at
amsterdam
in
it
is
curious
that
lyser
who
never
married
nor
desired
wedlock
should
have
advocated
polygamy
but
it
is
said
that
he
was
led
on
by
a
desire
for
providing
for
the
public
safety
by
increasing
the
population
of
the
country
though
probably
the
love
of
notoriety
which
has
added
many
authors
names
to
the
category
of
fools
contributed
much
to
his
madness
infected
with
the
same
notions
was
bernardino
ochino
a
franciscan
and
afterwards
a
capuchin
whose
dialogue
was
fatal
to
him
although
he
was
an
old
man
the
authorities
at
basle
ordered
him
to
leave
the
city
in
the
depth
of
a
severe
winter
he
wandered
into
poland
but
through
the
opposition
of
the
papal
nuncio
commendone
he
was
again
obliged
to
fly
he
had
to
mourn
over
the
death
of
two
sons
and
a
daughter
who
died
of
the
plague
in
poland
and
finally
ochino
ended
his
woes
in
moravia
such
was
the
miserable
fate
of
ochino
who
was
at
one
time
the
most
famous
preacher
in
the
whole
of
italy
he
had
a
wonderful
eloquence
which
seized
upon
the
minds
of
his
hearers
and
carried
them
whither
he
would
no
church
was
large
enough
to
contain
the
multitudes
which
flocked
to
hear
him
ochino
was
a
skilled
linguist
and
after
leaving
the
roman
church
he
wrote
a
book
against
the
papacy
in
english
which
was
printed
in
london
and
also
a
sermon
on
predestination
he
visited
england
in
company
with
peter
martyr
but
on
the
death
of
edward
on
account
of
the
changes
introduced
in
mary
reign
these
two
doctors
again
crossed
the
seas
and
retired
to
a
safer
retreat
his
brilliant
career
was
entirely
ruined
by
his
fatal
frenzy
and
foolish
fanaticism
for
polygamy
the
third
of
this
strange
triumvirate
was
samuel
friedrich
willenberg
a
doctor
of
law
of
the
famous
university
of
cracow
who
wrote
a
book
finibus
polygamiae
and
aroused
the
hatred
of
the
poles
in
by
command
of
the
high
court
of
the
king
of
poland
his
book
was
condemned
to
be
burnt
and
its
author
nearly
shared
the
same
fate
he
escaped
however
this
terrible
penalty
and
was
fined
one
hundred
thousand
gold
pieces
with
these
unhappy
advocates
of
a
system
which
violates
the
sacredness
of
marriage
we
must
close
our
list
of
fanatics
whose
works
have
proved
fatal
to
them
many
of
them
deserve
our
pity
rather
than
our
scorn
for
they
suffered
from
that
species
of
insanity
which
according
to
holmes
is
often

with

alchemy
astrology
and
magic
were
a
fashionable
cult
and
so
long
as
its
professors
pleased
their
patrons
proclaimed
smooth
things
and
prophesied
deceits
all
went
well
with
them
but
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
offend
folk
and
when
the
philosopher
stone
and
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
after
much
research
were
not
producible
the
cry
of
impostor
was
readily
raised
and
the
trade
of
magic
had
its
uncertainties
as
well
as
its
charms
our
first
author
who
suffered
as
an
astrologer
though
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
he
was
ever
guilty
of
the
charges
brought
against
him
was
henry
cornelius
agrippa
who
was
born
at
cologne
in
a
man
of
noble
birth
and
learned
in
medicine
law
and
theology
his
supposed
devotion
to
necromancy
and
his
adventurous
career
have
made
his
story
a
favourite
one
for
we
find
him
in
early
life
fighting
in
the
italian
war
under
the
emperor
maximilian
whose
private
secretary
he
was
the
honour
of
knighthood
conferred
upon
him
did
not
satisfy
his
ambition
and
he
betook
himself
to
the
fields
of
learning
at
the
request
of
margaret
of
austria
he
wrote
a
treatise
on
the
excellence
of
wisdom
which
he
had
not
the
courage
to
publish
fearing
to
arouse
the
hostility
of
the
theologians
of
the
day
as
his
views
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
scholasticism
of
the
monks
he
lived
the
roving
life
of
a
mediaeval
scholar
now
in
london
illustrating
the
epistles
of
paul
now
at
cologne
or
pavia
or
turin
lecturing
on
divinity
and
at
another
time
at
metz
where
he
resided
some
time
and
took
part
in
the
government
of
the
city
there
in
he
was
bereaved
of
his
beautiful
and
noble
wife
there
too
we
read
of
his
charitable
act
of
saving
from
death
a
poor
woman
who
was
accused
of
witchcraft
then
he
became
involved
in
controversy
combating
the
idea
that
anne
the
mother
of
the
blessed
virgin
had
three
husbands
and
in
consequence
of
the
hostility
raised
by
his
opinions
he
was
compelled
to
leave
the
city
the
people
used
to
avoid
him
as
if
he
carried
about
with
him
some
dread
infection
and
fled
from
him
whenever
he
appeared
in
the
streets
at
length
we
see
him
established
at
lyons
as
physician
to
the
queen
mother
the
princess
louise
of
savoy
and
enjoying
a
pension
from
francis
i
this
lady
seems
to
have
been
of
a
superstitious
turn
of
mind
and
requested
the
learned
agrippa
whose
fame
for
astrology
had
doubtless
reached
her
to
consult
the
stars
concerning
the
destinies
of
france
this
agrippa
refused
and
complained
of
being
employed
in
such
follies
his
refusal
aroused
the
ire
of
the
queen
her
courtiers
eagerly
took
up
the
cry
and
conjurer
necromancer
were
the
complimentary
terms
which
were
freely
applied
to
the
former
favourite
agrippa
fled
to
the
court
of
margaret
of
austria
the
governor
of
the
netherlands
under
charles
and
was
appointed
the
emperor
historiographer
he
wrote
a
history
of
the
reign
of
that
monarch
and
during
the
life
of
margaret
he
continued
his
prosperous
career
and
at
her
death
he
delivered
an
eloquent
funeral
oration
but
troubles
were
in
store
for
the
illustrious
author
in
he
published
a
work
incertitudine
et
vanitate
scientiarum
et
artium
atque
excellentiâ
verbi
dei
antwerp
his
severe
satire
upon
scholasticism
and
its
professors
roused
the
anger
of
those
whom
with
scathing
words
he
castigated
the
professors
of
the
university
of
louvain
declared
that
they
detected
errors
in
the
book
and
agrippa
was
forced
to
defend
himself
against
their
attacks
in
a
little
book
published
at
leyden
entitled
pro
defencione
declamationis
de
vanitate
scientiarum
contra
theologistes
in
spite
of
such
powerful
friends
as
the
papal
legate
cardinal
campeggio
and
cardinal
de
la
marck
prince
bishop
of
liège
agrippa
was
vilified
by
his
opponents
and
imprisoned
at
brussels
in
the
fury
against
his
book
continued
to
rage
and
its
author
declares
in
his
epistles
when
i
brought
out
my
book
for
the
purpose
of
exciting
sluggish
minds
to
the
study
of
sound
learning
and
to
provide
some
new
arguments
for
these
monks
to
discuss
in
their
assemblies
they
repaid
this
kindness
by
rousing
common
hostility
against
me
and
now
by
suggestions
from
their
pulpits
in
public
meetings
before
mixed
multitudes
with
great
clamourings
they
declaim
against
me
they
rage
with
passion
and
there
is
no
impiety
no
heresy
no
disgrace
which
they
do
not
charge
me
with
with
wonderful
gesticulations
namely
with
clapping
of
fingers
with
hands
outstretched
and
then
suddenly
drawn
back
with
gnashing
of
teeth
by
raging
by
spitting
by
scratching
their
heads
by
gnawing
their
nails
by
stamping
with
their
feet
they
rage
like
madmen
and
omit
no
kind
of
lunatic
behaviour
by
means
of
which
they
may
arouse
the
hatred
and
anger
of
both
prince
and
people
against
me
the
book
was
examined
by
the
inquisition
and
placed
by
the
council
of
trent
on
the
list
of
prohibited
works
amongst
the
heretical
books
of
the
first
class
erasmus
however
spoke
very
highly
of
it
and
declared
it
to
be
the
work
of
a
man
of
sparkling
intellect
of
varied
reading
and
good
memory
who
always
blames
bad
things
and
praises
the
good
schelhorn
declares
that
the
book
is
remarkable
for
the
brilliant
learning
displayed
in
it
and
for
the
very
weighty
testimony
which
it
bears
against
the
errors
and
faults
of
the
time
our
author
was
released
from
his
prison
at
brussels
and
wrote
another
book
occulta
antwerp
which
enabled
his
enemies
to
bring
against
him
the
charge
of
magic
stories
were
told
of
the
money
which
agrippa
paid
at
inns
turning
into
pieces
of
horn
and
shell
and
of
the
mysterious
dog
which
ate
and
slept
with
him
which
was
indeed
a
demon
in
disguise
and
vanished
at
his
death
they
declared
he
had
a
wonderful
wand
and
a
mirror
which
reflected
the
images
of
persons
absent
or
dead
the
reputed
wizard
at
length
returned
to
france
where
he
was
imprisoned
on
a
charge
of
speaking
evil
of
the
queen
mother
who
had
evidently
not
forgotten
his
refusal
to
consult
the
stars
for
her
benefit
he
was
however
soon
released
and
after
his
strange
wandering
life
our
author
ended
his
labours
in
a
hospital
at
grenoble
where
he
died
in
in
addition
to
the
works
we
have
mentioned
he
wrote
nobilitate
et
proecellentia
faeminei
antwerp
in
order
to
flatter
his
patroness
margaret
of
austria
and
an
early
work

recording

there
is

being
himself
a
philosopher

demon

hero
a
god
everything
the
impostor
joseph
francis
borri
was
a
very
different
character
he
was
a
famous
chemist
and
charlatan
born
at
milan
in
and
educated
by
the
jesuits
at
rome
being
a
student
of
medicine
and
chemistry
he
lived
a
wild
and
depraved
life
and
was
compelled
to
retire
into
a
seminary
then
he
suddenly
changed
his
conduct
and
pretended
to
be
inspired
by
god
advocating
in
a
book
which
he
published
certain
strange
notions
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
the
trinity
and
expressing
certain
ridiculous
opinions
such
as
that
the
mother
of
god
was
a
certain
goddess
that
the
holy
spirit
became
incarnate
in
the
womb
of
anna
and
that
not
only
christ
but
the
virgin
also
are
adored
and
contained
in
the
holy
eucharist
in
spite
of
the
folly
of
his
teaching
he
attracted
many
followers
and
also
the
attention
of
the
inquisition
perceiving
his
danger
he
fled
to
milan
and
thence
to
a
more
safe
retreat
in
amsterdam
and
hamburg
in
his
absence
the
inquisition
examined
his
book
and
passed
its
dread
sentence
upon
its
author
declaring
that
borri
ought
to
be
punished
as
a
heretic
for
his
errors
that
he
had
incurred
both
the
and
censures
that
he
was
deprived
of
all
honour
and
prerogative
in
the
church
of
whose
mercy
he
had
proved
himself
unworthy
that
he
was
expelled
from
her
communion
and
that
his
effigy
should
be
handed
over
to
the
cardinal
legate
for
the
execution
of
the
punishment
he
had
deserved
all
his
heretical
writings
were
condemned
to
the
flames
and
all
his
goods
confiscated
on
the
of
january
borri
effigy
and
his
books
were
burned
by
the
public
executioner
and
borri
declared
that
he
never
felt
so
cold
when
he
knew
that
he
was
being
burned
by
proxy
he
then
fled
to
a
more
secure
asylum
in
denmark
he
imposed
upon
frederick
saying
that
he
had
found
the
philosopher
stone
after
the
death
of
this
credulous
monarch
borri
journeyed
to
vienna
where
he
was
delivered
up
to
the
representative
of
the
pope
and
cast
into
prison
he
was
then
sent
to
rome
and
condemned
to
perpetual
imprisonment
in
the
castle
of
angelo
where
he
died
in
his
principal
work
was
entitled
chiave
del
gabineito
del
cavagliere
the
key
of
the
cabinet
of
borri
certainly
the
church
showed
him
no
mercy
but
perhaps
his
hard
fate
was
not
entirely
undeserved
the
tragic
death
of
urban
grandier
shows
how
dangerous
it
was
in
the
days
of
superstition
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
powerful
men
and
how
easily
the
charge
of
necromancy
could
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
removing
an
obnoxious
person
grandier
was
curé
of
the
church
of
peter
at
loudun
and
canon
of
the
church
of
the
holy
cross
he
was
a
pleasant
companion
agreeable
in
conversation
and
much
admired
by
the
fair
sex
indeed
he
wrote
a
book
caelibatum
in
which
he
strongly
advocated
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
and
showed
that
he
was
not
himself
indifferent
to
the
charms
of
the
ladies
in
an
evil
hour
he
wrote
a
little
book
entitled
cordonnière
de
in
which
he
attacked
richelieu
and
aroused
the
undying
hatred
of
the
great
cardinal
richelieu
was
at
that
time
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
and
when
offended
he
was
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
the
means
he
employed
to
carry
out
his
vengeance
as
the
fate
of
our
author
abundantly
testifies
in
the
town
of
loudun
was
a
famous
convent
of
ursuline
nuns
and
grandier
solicited
the
office
of
director
of
the
nunnery
but
happily
he
was
prevented
by
circumstances
from
undertaking
that
duty
a
short
time
afterwards
the
nuns
were
attacked
with
a
curious
and
contagious
frenzy
imagining
themselves
tormented
by
evil
spirits
of
whom
the
chief
was
asmodeus
footnote
this
was
the
demon
mentioned
in
tobit
iii
who
attacked
sarah
the
daughter
of
raguel
and
killed
her
seven
husbands
rabbinical
writers
consider
him
as
the
chief
of
evil
spirits
and
recount
his
marvellous
deeds
he
is
regarded
as
the
fire
of
impure
love
they
pretended
that
they
were
possessed
by
the
demon
and
accused
the
unhappy
grandier
of
casting
the
spells
of
witchcraft
upon
them
he
indignantly
refuted
the
calumny
and
appealed
to
the
archbishop
of
bordeaux
charles
de
sourdis
this
wise
prelate
succeeded
in
calming
the
troubled
minds
of
the
nuns
and
settled
the
affair
in
the
meantime
the
vengeful
eye
of
richelieu
was
watching
for
an
opportunity
he
sent
his
emissary
councillor
laubardemont
to
loudun
who
renewed
the
accusation
against
grandier
the
amiable
cleric
who
had
led
a
pious
and
regular
life
was
declared
guilty
of
adultery
sacrilege
magic
witchcraft
demoniacal
possession
and
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
after
receiving
an
application
of
the
torture
in
the
of
loudun
in
this
terrible
sentence
was
carried
into
execution
and
together
with
his
book
caelibatum
poor
grandier
was
committed
to
the
flames
when
he
ascended
his
funeral
pile
a
fly
was
observed
to
buzz
around
his
head
a
monk
who
was
standing
near
declared
that
as
beelzebub
was
the
god
of
flies
the
devil
was
present
with
grandier
in
his
dying
hour
and
wished
to
bear
away
his
soul
to
the
infernal
regions
an
account
of
this
strange
and
tragic
history
was
published
by
aubin
in
his

our
own
country
has
produced
a
noted
alchemist
and
astrologer
dee
whose
fame
extended
to
many
lands
he
was
a
very
learned
man
and
prolific
writer
and
obtained
the
office
of
warden
of
the
collegiate
church
of
manchester
through
the
favour
of
queen
elizabeth
who
was
a
firm
believer
in
his
astrological
powers
his
age
was
the
age
of
witchcraft
and
in
no
county
was
the
belief
in
the
magic
power
of
the
evil
eye
more
prevalent
than
in
lancashire
dee
however
disclaimed
all
dealings
with
the
black
art
in
his
petition
to
the
great
solomon
of
the
north
james
which
was
couched
in
these
words
it
has
been
affirmed
that
your
majesty
suppliant
was
the
conjurer
belonging
to
the
most
honourable
privy
council
of
your
majesty
predecessor
of
famous
memory
queen
elizabeth
and
that
he
is
or
hath
been
a
caller
or
invocater
of
devils
or
damned
spirits
these
slanders
which
have
tended
to
his
utter
undoing
can
no
longer
be
endured
and
if
on
trial
he
is
found
guilty
of
the
offence
imputed
to
him
he
offers
himself
willingly
to
the
punishment
of
death
yea
either
to
be
stoned
to
death
or
to
be
buried
quick
or
to
be
burned
unmercifully
in
spite
of
his
assertions
to
the
contrary
the
learned
doctor
must
have
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
black
art
and
was
the
companion
and
friend
of
edward
kelly
a
notorious
necromancer
who
for
his
follies
had
his
ears
cut
off
at
lancaster
this
kelly
used
to
exhume
and
consult
the
dead
in
the
darkness
of
night
he
and
his
companions
entered
churchyards
dug
up
the
bodies
of
men
recently
buried
and
caused
them
to
utter
predictions
concerning
the
fate
of
the
living
dee
friendship
with
kelly
was
certainly
suspicious
on
the
coronation
of
queen
elizabeth
he
foretold
the
future
by
consulting
the
stars
when
a
waxen
image
of
the
queen
was
found
in
which
was
a
sure
sign
that
some
one
was
endeavouring
to
cast
spells
upon
her
majesty
dee
pretended
that
he
was
able
to
defeat
the
designs
of
such
persons
and
prevent
his
royal
mistress
feeling
any
of
the
pains
which
might
be
inflicted
on
her
effigy
in
addition
his
books
of
which
there
were
many
witness
against
him
these
were
collected
by
casaubon
who
published
in
london
in
a
of
the
learned
doctor
works
manchester
was
made
too
hot
even
for
the
alchemist
through
the
opposition
of
his
clerical
brethren
and
he
was
compelled
to
resign
his
office
of
warden
of
the
college
then
accompanied
by
kelly
he
wandered
abroad
and
was
received
as
an
honoured
guest
at
the
courts
of
many
sovereigns
the
emperor
rodolphe
stephen
king

harsnett
bishop

afterwards
archbishop

doubted
the
marvellous
powers
of
the
pious
author
darrell
and
had
the
audacity
to
suggest
that
he
made
a
trade
of
casting
out

even
went
so
far

to
declare

science
in
its
infancy
found
many
powerful
opponents
who
not
understanding
the
nature
of
the
babe
strove
to
strangle
it
but
the
infant
grew
into
a
healthy
child
in
spite
of
its
cruel
stepmother
and
cried
so
loudly
and
talked
so
strangely
that
the
world
was
forced
to
listen
to
its
utterances
these
were
regarded
with
distrust
and
aversion
by
the
theologians
of
the
day
for
they
were
supposed
to
be
in
opposition
to
revelation
and
contrary
to
the
received
opinions
of
all
learned
and
pious
people
therefore
science
met
with
very
severe
treatment
its
followers
were
persecuted
with
relentless
vehemence
and
blasphemous
fables
and
dangerous
deceits
were
the
only
epithets
which
could
characterise
its
doctrines
the
controversy
between
religion
and

still
rages
in
spite
of
the
declaration
of
professor
huxley
that
in
his
opinion
the
conflict
between
the
two
is
entirely
factitious
but
theologians
are
wiser
now
than
they
were
in
the
days
of
galileo
they
are
waiting
to
see
what
the
scientists
can
prove
and
then
when
the
various
hypotheses
are
shown
to
be
true
it
will
be
time
enough
to
reconcile
the
verities
of
the
faith
with
the
facts
of
science
to
those
who
believed
that
the
earth
was
flat
it
was
somewhat
startling
to
be
told
that
there
were
antipodes
this
elementary
truth
of
cosmology
bishop
virgil
of
salzbourg
was
courageous
enough
to
assert
as
early
as
he
wrote
a
book
in
which
he
stated
that
men
of
another
race
not
sprung
from
adam
lived
in
the
world
beneath
our
feet
this
work
aroused
the
anger
of
pope
zacharias
ii
who
wrote
to
the
king
of
bavaria
that
virgil
should
be
expelled
from
the
temple
of
god
and
the
church
and
deprived
of
god
and
the
church
and
deprived
of
his
office
unless
he
confessed
his
perverse
errors
in
spite
of
the
censure
and
sentence
of
excommunication
pronounced
upon
him
bishop
virgil
was
canonised
by
pope
gregory
xi
thus
in
spite
of
his
misfortunes
brought
about
by
his
book
his
memory
was
revered
and
honoured
by
the
western
church
if
the
account
of
his
imprisonment
be
true
of
which
there
is
no
contemporary
evidence
our
own
celebrated
english
philosopher
roger
bacon
is
one
of
the
earliest
scientific
authors
whose
works
proved
fatal
to
them
in
he
sent
his
book
together
with
his
an
abridgement
of
his
former
work
to
pope
clement
iv
after
the
death
of
that
pope
bacon
was
cited
by
the
general
of
the
franciscan
order
to
which
he
belonged
to
appear
before
his
judges
at
paris
where
he
was
condemned
to
imprisonment
he
is
said
to
have
languished
in
the
dungeon
fourteen
years
and
worn
out
by
his
sufferings
to
have
died
in
his
beloved
oxford
during
the
year
of
his
release
the
charge
of
magic
was
freely
brought
against
him
his
great
work
which
has
been
termed
the
and
the
of
the
thirteenth
century
discloses
an
unfettered
mind
and
judgment
far
in
advance
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
in
addition
to
this
he
wrote
mirabili
potestate
artis
et
naturae
specula
mathematica
speculum
and
other
works
the
treatment
which
galileo
received
at
the
hands
of
the
ecclesiastics
of
his
day
is
well
known
this
father
of
experimental
philosophy
was
born
at
pisa
in
and
at
the
age
of
years
through
the
favour
of
the
medicis
was
elected
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
university
of
the
same
town
resigning
his
chair
in
he
became
professor
at
padua
and
then
at
florence
he
startled
the
world
by
the
publication
of
his
first
book
in
which
he
disclosed
his
important
astronomical
discoveries
amongst
others
the
satellites
of
jupiter
and
the
spots
on
the
sun
this
directed
the
attention
of
the
inquisition
to
his
labours
but
in
he
published
his
immortal
work
sopra
i
due
massimi
sistemi
del
monda
tolemaico
et
florence
which
was
the
cause
of
his
undoing
in
this
book
he
defended
the
opinion
of
copernicus
concerning
the
motion
of
the
earth
round
the
sun
which
was
supposed
by
the
theologians
of
the
day
to
be
an
opinion
opposed
to
the
teaching
of
holy
scripture
and
subversive
of
all
truth
the
work
was
brought
before
the
inquisition
at
rome
and
condemned
by
the
order
of
pope
urban
viii
galileo
was
commanded
to
renounce
his
theory
but
this
he
refused
to
do
and
was
cast
into
prison
are
these
then
my
judges
he
exclaimed
when
he
was
returning
from
the
presence
of
the
inquisitors
whose
ignorance
astonished
him
there
he
remained
for
five
long
years
until
at
length
wearied
by
his
confinement
the
squalor
of
the
prison
and
by
his
increasing
years
he
consented
to
recant
his
heresy
and
regained
his
liberty
the
old
man
lost
his
sight
at
years
of
age
and
died
four
years
later
in
in
addition
to
the
work
which
caused
him
so
great
misfortunes
he
published
e
demonstr
interna
alle
due
nuove
scienze
delia
scienza
meccanica
tractato
della
sfera
and
the
telescope
the
isochronism
of
the
vibrations
of
the
pendulum
the
hydrostatic
balance
the
thermometer
were
all
invented
by
this
great
leader
of
astronomical
and
scientific
discoverers
many
other
discoveries
might
have
been
added
to
these
had
not
his
widow
submitted
the
sage
mss
to
her
confessor
who
ruthlessly
destroyed
all
that
he
considered
unfit
for
publication
possibly
he
was
not
the
best
judge
of
such
matters
italy
also
produced
another
unhappy
philosophic
writer
jordano
bruno
who
lived
about
the
same
time
as
galileo
and
was
born
at
nole
in
being
fourteen
years
his
senior
at
an
early
age
he
acquired
a
great
love
of
study
and
a
thirst
for
knowledge
the
renaissance
and
the
revival
of
learning
had
opened
wide
the
gates
of
knowledge
and
there
were
many
eager
faces
crowding
around
the
doors
many
longing
to
enter
the
fair
paradise
and
explore
the
vistas
which
met
their
gaze
it
was
an
age
of
anxious
and
eager
inquiry
the
torpor
of
the
last
centuries
had
passed
away
and
a
new
world
of
discovery
with
freshness
dawned
upon
the
sight
jordano
bruno
was
one
of
these
zealous
students
of
the
sixteenth
century
we
see
him
first
in
a
dominican
convent
but
the
scholasticism
had
no
charms
for
him
the
narrow
groove
of
the
cloister
was
irksome
to
his
soul
he
cast
off
his
monkish
garb
and
wandered
through
europe
as
a
of
philosophy
ille
et
terris
jactatus
et
teaching
letters
in
we
find
him
at
geneva
conferring
with
calvin
and
beza
but
calvinism
did
not
commend
itself
to
his
philosophic
mind
thence
he
journeyed
to
paris
where
in
he
produced
one
of
his
more
important
works
umbris
soon
afterwards
he
came
to
london
where
he
became
the
intimate
friend
of
sir
philip
sidney
here
he
wrote
the
work
which
proved
fatal
to
him
entitled
della
bestia
the
expulsion
of
the
triumphing
beast

this
was
an
allegory
in
which
he
combated
superstition
and
satirised
the
errors
of
rome
but
in
this
work
bruno
fell
into
grievous
errors
and
dangerous
atheistic
deceits
he
scoffed
at
the
worship
of
god
declared
that
the
books
of
the
sacred
canon
were
merely
dreams
that
moses
worked
his
wonders
by
magical
art
and
blasphemed
the
saviour
bruno
furnished
another
example
of
those
whose
faith
having
been
at
one
time
forced
to
accept
dogmas
bred
of
superstition
has
been
weakened
and
altogether
destroyed
when
they
have
perceived
the
falseness
and
fallibility
of
that
which
before
they
deemed
infallible
but
in
spite
of
these
errors
bruno
learning
was
remarkable
he
had
an
extensive
knowledge
of
all
sciences
from
england
he
went
to
germany
and
lectured
at
wittenberg
prague
and
frankfort
his
philosophy
resembled
that
of
spinosa
he
taught
that
god
is
the
substance
and
life
of
all
things
and
that
the
universe
is
an
immense
animal
of
which
god
is
the
soul
at
length
he
had
the
imprudence
to
return
to
italy
and
became
a
teacher
at
padua
at
venice
he
was
arrested
by
order
of
the
inquisition
in
and
conducted
to
rome
where
after
an
imprisonment
of
two
years
in
order
that
he
might
be
punished
as
gently
as
possible
without
the
shedding
of
blood
he
was
sentenced
to
be
burned
alive
with
a
courage
worthy
of
a
philosopher
he
exclaimed
to
his
merciless
judges
you
pronounce
sentence
upon
me
with
greater
fear
than
i
receive
it

works
were

the
inquisition
at
rome
at
this
period
was
particularly
active
in
its
endeavours
to
reform
errant
philosophers
and
bruno
was
by
no
means
the
only
victim
who
felt
its
power
thomas
campanella
born
in
calabria
in
italy
conceived
the
design
of
reforming
philosophy
about
the
same
time
as
our
more
celebrated
bacon
this
was
a
task
too
great
for
his
strength
nor
did
he
receive
much
encouragement
from
the
existing
powers
he
attacked
scholasticism
with
much
vigour
and
censured
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
the
admired
of
the
schoolmen
he
wrote
a
work
entitled
sensibus
in
which
he
defended
the
ideas
of
telesio
who
explained
the
laws
of
nature
as
founded
upon
two
principles
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
coldness
of
the
earth
he
declared
that
all
our
knowledge
was
derived
from
sensation
and
that
all
parts
of
the
earth
were
endowed
with
feeling
campanella
also
wrote
philosophiae
embracing
grammar
dialectics
rhetoric
poetry
and
history
a
treatise
on
metaphysics
a
description
of
a
kind
of
utopia
after
the
fashion
of
but
the
fatal
book
which
caused
his
woes
was
his
on
account
of
this
work
he
was
cast
into
prison
and
endured
so
much
misery
that
we
can
scarcely
bear
to
think
of
his
tortures
and
sufferings
for
years
he
endured
all
the
squalor
and
horrors
of
a
mediaeval
dungeon
through
hours
he
was
questioned
with
such
exceeding
cruelty
that
all
his
veins
and
arteries
were
so
drawn
and
stretched
by
the
rack
that
the
blood
could
not
flow
yet
he
bore
all
this
terrible
agony
with
a
brave
spirit
and
did
not
utter
a
cry
various
causes
have
been
assigned
for
the
severity
of
this
torture
inflicted
on
poor
campanella
some
attribute
it
to
the
malice
of
the
scholastic
philosophers
whom
he
had
offended
by
his
works
others
say
that
he
was
engaged
in
some
treasonable
conspiracy
to
betray
the
kingdom
of
naples
to
the
spaniards
but
it
is
probable
that
his
was
the
chief
cause
of
his
woes
sorbière
has
thus
passed
judgment
upon
this
fatal
book
though
nothing
is
dearer
to
me
than
time
the
loss
of
which
grieves
me
sorely
i
confess
that
i
have
lost
both
oil
and
labour
in
reading
the
empty
book
of
an
empty
monk
thomas
campanella
it
is
a
farrago
of
vanities
has
no
order
many
obscurities
and
perpetual
barbarisms
one
thing
i
have
learned
in
wandering
through
this
book
that
i
will
never
read
another
book
of
this
author
even
if
i
could
spare
the
time
authorities
differ
with
regard
to
the
ultimate
fate
of
this
author
some
say
that
he
was
killed
in
prison
in
others
declare
that
he
was
released
and
fled
to
france
where
he
enjoyed
a
pension
granted
to
him
by
richelieu
however
during
his
incarceration
he
continued
his
studies
and
wrote
a
work
concerning
the
spanish
monarchy
which
was
translated
from
italian
into
german
and
latin
in
spite
of
his
learning
he
made
many
enemies
by
his
arrogance
and
his
restless
and
ambitious
spirit
carried
him
into
enterprises
which
were
outside
the
proper
sphere
of
his
philosophy
in
this
he
followed
the
example
of
many
other
luckless
authors
to
whom
the
advice
of
the
homely
proverb
would
have
been
valuable
which
states
that

on

saillant
and

of

de

was
sent
to
prison
but
the
severity
of
the
punishment
aroused
popular
indignation
and
his
journey
to
gaol
resembled
a
triumph
all
the
learned
of
paris
visited
the
imprisoned
philosopher
all
the
sentences
were
reversed
by
the
parliament
of
paris

often
been
reproduced
and

other

de
lisle
was
exposed
to
the
persecutions
of
the
reign
of
terror
and
another
work
of

him

subsequently

years

a
similar

the

englishman
john

this
man
was
ingeniously
defrauded
of
the
work
which
owed
its
conception
and
execution
entirely
to
him
perhaps
on
the
whole
he
might
have
been
congratulated
as
he
escaped
the
bastille

the
appropriators
of

were
consigned

author
who

to

superstitious
beliefs
current
in
his
time
often
suffers
in

of
his
courage

balthazar

discovered
to
his
cost
this
writer
was
born
in
west
friezland
in
and
died
at

in
he
was
a
pastor
of
the
reformed
church
of
holland
and
resided
during
the
greater
part
of
his
life
at
amsterdam
where
he
produced
his
earlier
work
sur

in
which
he
combated
the
popular
belief
in
the
malign
influence
of

this
work
was
followed
a
few
years
later
by

famous

de
balthazar
delft
in
which
he
refuted
the
vulgar
notions
with
regard
to

possession
this
work
created
a
great
excitement
amongst
the
hollanders
and
in
two
months
no
less
than
four
thousand
copies
were
sold
but
unfortunately
for
the
author
it
aroused
the
indignation
of
the
theologians
of
the
reformed
church
who
condemned
it
deprived
bekker
of
his
office
and
expelled
him
from
their
communion
bekker
died
shortly
after
his
sentence
had
been
pronounced
a
great
variety
of
opinions
have
been
expressed
concerning
this
book
bekker
was
a
follower
of
descartes
and
this
was
sufficient
to
condemn
him
in
the
eyes
of
many
of
the
theologians
of
the
day
the
jansenists
of
and
the
divines
of
the
old
national
church
of
holland
were
vehement
opponents
of
cartesianism
consequently
we
find
de
vries
of
utrecht
declaring
that
this
fatal
book
caused
more
evil
in
the
space
of
two
months
than
all
the
priests
could
prevent
in
twenty
years
another
writer
states
that
it
is
an
illustrious
work
and
full
of
wisdom
and
learning
when
bekker
was
deposed
from
his
office
his
adversaries
caused
a
medal
to
be
struck
representing
the
devil
clad
in
a
priestly
robe
riding
on
an
ass
and
carrying
a
trophy
in
his
right
hand
which
was
intended
to
signify
that
bekker
had
been
overcome
in
his
attempt
to
disprove
demoniacal
possession
and
that
the
devil
had
conquered
in
the
assembly
of
divines
who
pronounced
sentence
on
bekker
book
the
author
was
supposed
to
resemble
satan
in
the
ugliness
of
his
appearance
another
coin
was
struck
in
honour
of
our
author
on
one
side
is
shown
the
figure
of
bekker
clad
in
his
priestly
robe
and
on
the
other
is
seen
hercules

his
club
with
this
inscription
virtutis

bekker
also
wrote
a
catechism
entitled
nourriture
des
which
so
offended
the
authorities
of
the
reformed
church
that
its
use
was
publicly
prohibited
by
the
sound
of
bells
the
science
of
ethnology
has
also
had
its
victims
and
one
isaac

in
which
he
advocated
a
theory
that
the
earth
had
been
peopled
by
a
race
which
existed
before
adam
the
author
was
born
at
bordeaux
in
and
served
with
the
prince
of
condé
but
in
spite
of
his
protector
he
was
imprisoned
at
brussels
and
his
book
was
burnt
at
paris
in
this
work
had
a
salutary
effect
on
the
indefatigable
translator
abbé
de
marolles
who
with
extraordinary
energy
but
with
little
skill
was
in
the
habit
of
translating
the
classical
works
and
almost
anything
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
he
published
no
less
than
seventy
volumes
and
at
last
turned
his
attention
to
the
sacred
scriptures
translating
them
with
notes
in
the
latter
he
inserted
extracts
and
reflections
from
the
book
by
peyrère
which
caused
a
sudden
cessation
of
his
labours
by
the
authority
of
the
pope
the
printing
of
his
works
was
suddenly
stopped
but
probably
the
loss
which
the
world
incurred
was
not
very
great
peyrère
seems
to
have
foretold
the
fate
of
his
book
and
his
own
escape
in
the
following
line
nec
invideo
sine
me
liber
ibis
in
lucilio
vanini
born
in
was
an
italian
philosopher
learned
in
medicine
astronomy
theology
and
philosophy
who
after
the
fashion
of
the
scholars
of
the
age
roamed
from
country
to
country
like
the
of
the
days
of
chivalry
seeking
for
glory
and
honours
not
by
the
sword
but
by
learning
this
vanini
was
a
somewhat
vain
and
ridiculous
person
not
content
with
his
christian
name
lucilio
he
assumed
the
grandiloquent
and
cognomen
of
julius
caesar
wishing
to
attach
to
himself
some
of
the
glory
of
the
illustrious
founder
of
the
roman
empire
as
the
proud
roman
declared
vidi
so
would
he
carry
on
the
same
victorious
career
subduing
all
rival
philosophers
by
the
power
of
his
eloquence
and
learning
he
visited
naples
wandered
through
france
germany
the
netherlands
switzerland
and
england
and
finally
stationed
himself
in
france
first
at
lyons
and
then
in
a
convent
at
toulouse
at
lyons
he
produced
his
famous
and
fatal
book
aeternae
providentiae
nec
non
lugduni
it
was
published
with
the
royal
assent
but
afterwards
brought
upon
its
author
the
charge
of
atheism
he
concealed
the
poison
most
carefully
for
apparently
he
defended
the
belief
in
the
divine
providence
and
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
with
consummate
skill
and
subtilty
he
taught
that
which
he
pretended
to
refute
and
led
his
readers
to
see
the
force
of
the
arguments
against
the
faith
of
which
he
posed
as
a
champion
by
a
weak
and
feeble
defence
by
foolish
arguments
and
ridiculous
reasoning
he
secretly
exposed
the
whole
christian
religion
to
ridicule
but
if
any
doubts
were
left
whether
this
was
done
designedly
or
unintentionally
they
were
dispelled
by
his
second
work
admirandis
naturae
reginae
deaeque
mortalium
paris
which
published
in
the
form
of
sixty
dialogues
contained
many
profane
statements
in
this
work
also
he
adopted
his
previous
plan
of
pretending
to
demolish
the
arguments
against
the
faith
while
he
secretly
sought
to
establish
them
he
says
that
he
had
wandered
through
europe
fighting
against
the
atheists
wherever
he
met
with
them
he
describes
his
disputations
with
them
carefully
recording
all
their
arguments
he
concludes
each
dialogue
by
saying
that
he
reduced
the
atheists
to
silence
but
with
strange
modesty
he
does
not
inform
his
readers
what
reasonings
he
used
and
practically
leaves
the
carefully
drawn
up
atheistical
arguments
unanswered
the
inquisition
did
not
approve
of
this
subtle
method
of
teaching
atheism
and
ordered
him
to
be
confined
in
prison
and
then
to
be
burned
alive
this
sentence
was
carried
out
at
toulouse
in
in
spite
of
his
protestations
of
innocence
and
the
arguments
which
he
brought
forward
before
his
judges
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
some
have
tried
to
free
vanini
from
the
charge
of
atheism
but
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
his
guilt
apart
from
his
books
the
tender
mercies
of
the
inquisition
were
cruel
and
could
not
allow
so
notable
a
victim
to
escape
their
vengeance
whether
to
burn
a
man
is
the
surest
way
to
convert
him
is
a
question
open
to
argument
vanini
disguised
his
insidious
teaching
carefully
but
it
required
a
thick
veil
to
deceive
the
eyes
of
inquisitors
who
were
wonderfully
clever
in
spying
out
heresy
and
sometimes
thought
they
had
discovered
it
even
when
it
was
not
there
vanini
and
many
other
authors
would
have
been
wiser
if
they
had
not
committed
their
ideas
to
writing
and
contented
themselves
with
words
only
scripta
and
disguise
it
twist
it
explain
it
as
you
will
there
it
stands
a
witness
for
your
acquittal
or
your
condemnation
this
thought
stays
the
course
of
the
most
restless
pen
though
the
racks
and
fires
of
the
inquisition
no
longer
threaten
the
incautious
scribe
we
must
not
omit
a
french
philosopher
who
died
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
first
french
revolution
jean
jacques
rousseau
it
is
well
known
that
his
work
ou

rousseau
citoyen

obliged
him
to
fly
from
france
and
switzerland
in
both
of
which
countries
he
was
adjudged
to
prison
for
many
years
he
passed
a
wandering
anxious
life
ever
imagining
that
his
best
friends
wished
to
betray
him
of
his
virtues
and
failings
as
an
author
or
of
the
vast
influence
he
exercised
over
the
minds
of
his
countrymen

he

by

very
plainly

instance
of

we
may
observe
that

of
the
historian
paolo
giovio
who
was
a
strong
partisan
of

displaying
much

this
book
aroused
the
ire
of
the
powerful

encouraged
the

to

to
withstand
all
the
attempts
of

disavowed

dupin
was
a
learned
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
and
professor
of
the
college
of
france
and
he
devoted
most
of
his
life
to
his
immense
work
which
is
a
proof
of
his
marvellous
energy
and
industry
he
gives
an
account
of
the
lives
of
the
writers
a
catalogue
of
their
works
with
the
dates
when
they
were
issued
and
a
criticism
of
their
style
and
of
the
doctrines
set
forth
therein
but
the
learned
historian
involved
himself
in
controversy
with
the
advocates
of
papal
supremacy
by
publishing
a
book
antiqua
ecclesiae
in
which
he
defended
with
much
zeal
the
liberty
of
the
gallican
church
he
lived
at
the
time
when
that
church
was
much
agitated
by
the
assumptions
of

by
the
worthless
louis

by
the
resistance
of
the
jansenists
to
the
famous
bull
for
three
years
france
was
torn
by
these
disputes
a
large
number
of
the
bishops
were
opposed
to
the
enforcing
of
this
bull
and
the
first
theological
school
in
europe
the
sorbonne
joined
with
them
in
resisting
the
tyranny
of
the
pope
and
the
machinations
of
madame
de
maintenon
dupin
took
an
active
part
with
the
other
theologians
of
his
school
in
opposing
this
and
wrote
his
book
antiqua
ecclesiae
in
order
to
defend
the
gallican
church
from
the
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
rome
in
this
work
he
carefully
distinguishes
the
universal
catholic
church
from
the
roman
church
and
shows
that
the
power
of
the
papacy
was
not
founded
on
any
warrant
of
holy
scripture
nor
on
the
judgments
of
the
fathers
he
allows
that
the
power
of
keys
was
given
to
peter
but
not
to
one
man
individually
but
to
the
whole
church
represented
by
him
the
authority
of
the
pope
extends
not
beyond
certain
fixed
boundaries
and
the
temporal
and
civil
power
claimed
by
the
papacy
is
not
conjoined
to
the
spiritual
power
and
ought
to
be
separated
from
it
this
plain
speaking
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
occupier
of
the
papal
throne
nor
to
his
tool
louis
who
deprived
dupin
of
his
professorship
and
banished
him

dupin
last

wake
of

who
was
endeavouring
to
devise
a
plan
for
the
reunion
of
the
churches
of
france
and
england
unhappily
the
supporters
of
the
national
church
of
france
were
overpowered
by
the
ultramontane
party
otherwise
it
might
have
been

to
the
hearts
of

misfortune
was
noel
alexandre
a
french
ecclesiastical
historian
who
lived
at
the

period

shared
dupin
views
with
regard
to
the

of

were
not
very
favourable
to
the

the

its

was
excommunicated

was
subsequently
removed

we
find
our

provincial
of

in

having
subscribed
his
name
to
the
celebrated

with
forty
other
doctors
of

he
was
banished
to
châtelleraut
and
deprived
of
his
pension
he
died
in
italian
historians
seem
to
have
fared
ill
and
our
next
author
peter
giannone
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
he
was
born
in
and
resided
some
time
at
naples
following
the
profession
of
a
lawyer
there
he
published
in
four
volumes
of
his
illustrious
work
entitled
historia
civile
del
regno
di
napoli
dopo
sino
ad
re
carlo
da

giannone
napoli
nicolo
which
on
account
of
certain
strictures
upon
the
temporal
authority
of
the
pope
involved
him
in
many
troubles
this
remarkable
work
occupied
the
writer
twenty
years
and
contains
the
result
of
much
study
and
research
exposing
with
great
boldness
the
usurpations
of
the
pope
and
his
cardinals
and
other
ecclesiastical
enormities
and
revealing
many
obscure
points
with
regard
to
the
constitution
laws
and
customs
of
the
kingdom
of
naples
he
was
aware
of
the
great
dangers
which
would
threaten
him
if
he
dared
to
publish
this
immortal
work
but
he
bravely
faced
the
cruel
fate
which
awaited
him
and
verified
the
prophetic
utterance
of
a
friend
you
have
placed
on
your
head
a
crown
of
thorns
and
of
very
sharp
ones
this
book
created
many
difficulties
between
the
king
of
naples
and
the
occupant
of
the
papal
see
and
its
author
was
excommunicated
and
compelled
to
leave
naples
while
his
work
was
placed
on
the
index
of
prohibited
books
giannone
then
led
a
wandering
life
for
some
time
and
at
length
imagined
that
he
had
found
a
safe
asylum
at
venice
but
his
powerful
enemies
contrived
that
he
should
be
expelled
from
the
territory
of

venetian
republic
milan
padua
modena
afforded
him
only
temporary
and
at
last
he
betook
himself
to
geneva
there
he
began
to
write
vol
of
his
history
he
was
accosted
one
day
by
a
certain
nobleman
who
professed
great
admiration
of
his
writings
and
was
much
interested
in
all
that
giannone
told
him
his
new
friend
invited
him
to
dinner
at
a
farmstead
which
was
situated
not
far
from
geneva
but
just
within
the
borders
of
the
kingdom
of
savoy
fearing
no
treachery
giannone
accepted
the
invitation
of
his
new
friend
but
the
repast
was
not
concluded
before
he
was
arrested
by
order
of
the
king
of
sardinia
conveyed
to
a
prison
and
then
transferred
to
rome
the
fates
of
the
poor
captives
in
angelo
were
very
similar
in
spite
of
a
useless
retractation
of
his
errors
he
was
never
released
and
died
in
prison
in

translated
into

many
of

all
the
passages
in
this
book
so
fatal
to
its
author
which
were
hostile
to
the

many
of
his
scathing
criticisms

to
the
arguments
of

relating
to
the
temporal

man
assuming
the

wrote
in
a
fatal
book
upon
the
civil
history
of
the
kingdom
of

in
which
he
attacked
giannone
with
the
utmost
vehemence
and
heaped
upon
him
every
kind
of
disgraceful
accusation
and
calumny
this

first
published
secretly
and
then
sold
openly
by
two
booksellers
by
whom
it
was
disseminated
into
every
part
of

it
fell
into
the
hands
of

summoned
his
council

inquired
what

followed
the
fortunes
of

monarch
and
was
one
of
the
signatories
of
the
edict
of
nantes
but
his
writings
created
enemies
and
amongst
them
the
most
formidable
was
the
mighty
richelieu
who
disliked
him
because
our

had
not
praised
one

guilty

unpardonable
offence

a
slight
was

in

certain
misfortunes
which
befell
him
on

of
his
works
lived
to
the
age
of
years
he
was
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
studied
at
rome
and
paris
and
then
retired
to
the
house
of
the
jesuits
at
toledo
where
he
devoted
himself
to
his
writings
his
most
important
work
was
his
de
rebus
hispaniae
libri
published
at
toledo
but
the
work
which
brought
him
into
trouble
was
one
entitled
mutatione
which
exposed
the
frauds
of
the
ministers
of
the
king
of
spain
with
regard
to
the
adulteration
of
the
public
money
and
censured
the
negligence
and
laziness
of
philip
declaring
that
spain
had
incurred
great
loss
by
the
depreciation
in
the
value
of
the
current
coin
of
the
realm
this
book
aroused
the
indignation
of
the
king
who
ordered
mariana
to
be
cast
into
prison
the
spanish
historian
certainly
deserved
this
fate
not
on
account
of
the
book
which
brought
this
punishment
upon
him
but
on
account
of
another
work
entitled

ad
philippum
hispaniae
regem
toleti
apud
petrum
rodericum
in
this
book
mariana
propounded
the
hateful
doctrine
generally
ascribed
to
the
jesuits
that
a
king
who
was
a
tyrant
and
a
heretic
ought
to
be
slain
either
by
open
violence
or
by
secret
plots
it
is
said
that
the
reading
of
this
book
caused
ravaillac
to
commit
his
crime
of
assassinating
henry
iv
of
france
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
the
book
was
burned
at
paris
in
by
order
of
the
parliament
the
historian
of
the
dutch
war
of
endured
much
distress
by
reason
of
his
truthfulness
this
was
john
baptist
primi
count
of
his
book
was
first
published
in
italian
and
entitled
della
guerra
nell
anno
parigi
and
in
the
same
year
a
french
translation
was
issued
the
author
alludes
to
the
discreditable
treaty
of
dover
whereby
charles
the
sovereign
of
england
became
a
pensioner
of
france
and
basely
agreed
to
desert
his
dutch
allies
whom
he
had
promised
to
aid
with
all
his
resources
the
exposure
of
this
base
business
was
not
pleasing
to
the
royal
ears
lord
preston
the
english
ambassador
applied
to
the
court
for
the
censure
of
the
author
who
was
immediately
sent
to
the
bastille
his
book
was
very
vigorously
suppressed
so
that
few
copies
exist
of
either
the
italian
or
french
versions
amongst
historians
we
include
one
writer
of
biography
john
christopher
rüdiger
who
under
the
name
of
clarmundus
wrote
a
book
vitis
clarissimorum
in
re
litteraria
he
discoursed
pleasantly
upon
the
fates
of
authors
and
their
works
but
unhappily
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
powerful
german
family
of
carpzov
which
produced
many
learned
theologians
lawyers
and
philologists
the
chief
of
this
family
was
one
samuel
benedict
carpzov
who
lived
at
wittenberg
wrote
several
dissertations
and
was
accounted
the
chrysostom
of
his
age
rüdiger
in
part
ix
of
his
work
wrote
the
biography
of
this
learned
man
suppressing
his
good
qualities
and
ascribing
to
him
many
bad
ones
and
did
scant
justice
to
the
memory
of
so
able
a
theologian
this
so
enraged
the
sons
and
other
relations
of
the
great
man
that
they
accused
rüdiger
of
slander
before
the
ecclesiastical
court
and
the
luckless
author
was
ordered
to
be
beaten
with
rods
and
to
withdraw
all
the
calumnies
he
had
uttered
against
the
renowned

rüdiger
was
imprisoned

haudicquer
the
unfortunate
compiler
of

was
doomed
to
the

on
account
of
the
complaints
of
certain
noble
families
who
felt
themselves
aggrieved
by

his

he
took
the
opportunity
of
vilifying
and
dishonouring
them
in
his
work
by
many
false
statements
and
patents
which
so
enraged
them
that
they
accomplished
the
destruction
of
the
calumniating

the
book
in

of
his
untrustworthiness
is
sought
after
by
curious
as
the

of
it
are
extremely
rare
and
few

it
is
usually
hazardous
to
endeavour
to
alter

in

to
support
historical
theories
this
françois
de
rosières
archdeacon
of
toul
discovered
who
endeavoured
to
show
in
his
history
of
lorraine
that
the
crown

rightly
belonged
to
that

the

had
a
vast
number
of
descendants
all
over
western
europe
if
early
genealogies
are
to
be
credited
but
de
rosières
altered
and
transposed
many
ancient
charters
and
royal
patents
in
order
to
support
his
theory
with
regard
to
the
sovereignty
of
the

of

his
false
documents
were
proved
to
have
been
forged
by
the
author
the
anger
of
the
french
was
aroused
he
was
compelled
to
sue
for
pardon
before
henry
iii
his
book
was
proscribed
and
burnt
but
for
the
protection
of
the
house
of
guise
he
would
have
shared
the
fate
of
his
book
and
was
condemned
to
imprisonment
in
the
bastille
the
learned
swedish
historian
rudbeck
may
perhaps
be
included
in
our
list
of
authors
although
his
death
was
not
brought
about
by
the
machinations
of
his
foes
he
wrote
a
great
work
on
the
origin
antiquities
and
history
of
sweden
but
soon
after
its
completion
he
witnessed
the
destruction
of
his
book
in
the
great
fire
of
upsal
in
the
disappointment
caused
by
the
loss
of
his
work
was
so
great
that
he
died
the
same
year
rudbeck
is
not
the
only
author
who
so
loved
his
work
that
he
died
when
deprived
of
his
treasure
a
great
scholar
of
the
fifteenth
century
one
anthony
urseus
who
lived
at
forli
had
just
finished
a
great
work
when
unhappily
he
left
a
lighted
lamp
in
his
study
during
his
absence
the
fatal
flame
soon
enveloped
his
books
and
papers
and
the
poor
author
on
his
return
went
mad
beating
his
head
against
the
door
of
his
palace
and
raving
blasphemous
words
in
vain
his
friends
tried
to
comfort
him
and
the
poor
man
wandered
away
into
the
woods
his
mind
utterly
distraught
by
the
enormity
of
his
loss
few
authors
have
the
bravery
the
energy
and
amazing
perseverance
of
carlyle
who
when
his
had
been
burned
by
the
thoughtlessness
of
his
friend

could
calmly
return
to

his

over
again

reinking
the
thorny
subject
of
politics
has
had
many
victims
and
not
a
few
english
authors
who
have
dealt
in
have
suffered
on
account
of
their
works
the
stormy
period
of
the
reformation
with
its
ebbs
and
flows
its
action
and
reaction
was
not
a
very
safe
time
for
writers
of
pronounced
views
the
way
to
the
block
was
worn
hard
by
the
feet
of
many
pilgrims
and
the
fires
of
smithfield
shed
a
lurid
glare
over
this
melancholy
page
of
english
history
one
of
the
earliest
victims
was
john
fisher
bishop
of
rochester
a
prelate
renowned
for
his
learning
his
pious
life
and
for
the
royal
favour
which
he
enjoyed
both
from
henry
vii
and
henry
viii
the
margaret
professorship
at
cambridge
and
the
colleges
of
john
and
christ
owe
their
origin
to
fisher
who
induced
margaret
the
countess
of
richmond
and
mother
of
henry
to
found
them
fisher
became
chancellor
of
the
university
and
acted
as
tutor
to
henry
viii
high
dignities
and
royal
favours
were
bestowed
upon
the
man
whom
kings
delighted
to
honour
but
bishop
fisher
was
no
prelate
nor
respecter
of
persons
and
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
his
convictions
whatever
consequences
might
result
when
the
monarch
wearied
of
his
first
wife
the
catherine
and
desired
to
wed
anne
boleyn
the
bishops
were
consulted
and
fisher
alone
declared
that
in
his
opinion
the
divorce
would
be
unlawful
he
wrote
a
fatal
book
against
the
divorce
and
thus
roused
the
hatred
of
the
headstrong
monarch
he
was
cast
into
prison
on
account
of
his
refusing
the
oath
with
regard
to
the
succession
and
his
supposed
connection
with
the
treason
of
elizabeth
barton
whose
mad
ravings
caused
many
troubles
he
was
deprived
not
only
of
his
revenues
but
also
of
his
clothes
in
spite
of
his
extreme
age
and
the
severity
of
a
hard
winter
and
for
twelve
long
dreary
months
languished
in
the
tower
the
pope
added
to
the
resentment
which
henry
bore
to
his
old
tutor
by
making
him
a
cardinal
and
the
red
hat
sealed
his
doom
the
pope
may
send
him
a
hat
said
the
ferocious
monarch
but
mother
of
god
he
shall
wear
it
on
his
shoulders
for
i
will
leave
him
never
a
head
to
set
it
on
he
was
charged
with
having
falsely
maliciously
and
traitorously
wished
willed
and
desired
and
by
craft
imagined
invented
practised
and
attempted
to
deprive
the
king
of
the
dignity
title
and
name
of
his
royal
estate
that
is
of
his
title
and
name
of
supreme
head
of
the
church
of
england
in
the
tower
on
the
seventh
day
of
may
last
when
contrary
to
his
allegiance
he
said
and
pronounced
in
the
presence
of
different
true
subjects
falsely
maliciously
and
traitorously
these
words
the
king
oure
soveraign
lord
is
not
supreme
hedd
yn
erthe
of
the
cherche
of
englande
these
words
drawn
from
him
by
rich
were
found
sufficient
to
effect
the
king
pleasure
the
aged
prelate
was
pronounced
guilty
and
beheaded
on
july
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
he
exclaimed
feet
do
your
duty
you
have
only
a
short
journey
and
then
singing
the
deum
he
placed
his
head
upon
the
block
and
the
executioner
axe
fell
although
bishop
fisher
was
condemned
for
denying
the
king
supremacy
he
incurred
the
wrath
of
henry
by
his
book
against
the
divorce
and
that
practically
sealed
his
fate
his
head
was
placed
on
a
spike
on
london
bridge
as
a
warning
to
others
who
might
be
rash
enough
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
ruthless
king
another
fatal
book
which
belongs
to
this
period
is
unitate
ecclesiae
ad
henricum
written
by
reginald
pole
in
the
secure
retreat
of
padua
in
which
the
author
compares
henry
to
nebuchadnezzar
and
prays
the
emperor
of
germany
to
direct
his
arms
against
so
heretical
a
christian
rather
than
against
the
turks
secure
in
his
retreat
at
the
papal
court
pole
did
not
himself
suffer
on
account
of
his
book
but
the
vengeance
of
henry
fell
heavily
upon
his
relations
in
england
in
whose
veins
ran
the
royal
blood
of
the
plantagenets
who
had
swayed
the
english
sceptre
through
so
many
generations
sir
geoffrey
pole
a
brother
of
the
cardinal
was
seized
this
arrest
was
followed
by
that
of
lord
montague
another
brother
and
the
countess
of
salisbury
their
mother
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
clarence
brother
of
edward

they
were
accused
of
having
devised
to
maintain
promote
and
advance

pole
late
dean
of
exeter
the
king
enemy
beyond

and
to
deprive
the
king
of
his
royal
state
and
dignity
sir
geoffrey
pole
contrived
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
henry
by
betraying
his
companions
but
the
rest
were
executed
for
some
time
pole
mother
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
as
a
hostage
for
her
son
conduct
she
was
more
than
seventy
years
of
age
and
after
two
years
imprisonment
was
condemned
to
be
beheaded
when
ordered
to
lay
her
head
upon
the
block
she
replied
no
my
head
never
committed
treason
if
you
will
have
it
you
must
take
it
as
you
can
she
was
held
down
by
force
and
died
exclaiming
blessed
are
they
who
suffer
persecution
for
righteousness
sake
henry
endeavoured
to
tempt
the
cardinal
to
england
but
in
vain
was
the
net
spread
in
sight
of
any
bird
in
his
absence
he
was
condemned
for
treason
the
king
of
france
and
the
emperor
were
asked
to
deliver
him
up
to
justice
spies
and
emissaries
of
henry
were
sent
to
watch
him
and
he
believed
that
ruffians
were
hired
to
assassinate
him
but
he
survived
all
these
perils
being
employed
by
the
pope
on
various
missions
and
passing
his
leisure
in
literary
labours
he
presided
at
the
council
of
trent
and
lived
to
return
to
england
during
the
reign
of
mary
became
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
strived
to
appease
the
sanguinary
rage
of
that
dreadful
persecution
which
is
a
lasting
disgrace
to
humanity
and
to
the
unhappy
queen
its
chief
instigator
the
rise
of
the
puritan
faction
and
all
the
troubles
of
the
rebellion
caused
many
woes
to
reckless
authors
in
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
the
puritan
party
opened
a
vehement
attack
upon
the
episcopalians
and
published
books
reviling
the
whole
body
as
well
as
the
individual
members
the
most
noted
of
these
works
were
put
forth
under
the
fictitious
name
of
martin
marprelate
they
were
base
scurrilous
productions
very
coarse
breathing
forth
terrible
hate
against
bouncing
priests
and
bishops
here
is
an
example
dialogue
wherein
is
laid
open
the
tyrannical
dealing
of
bishopps
against
it
is
full
of
scandalous
stories
of
the
prelates
who
lived
irreproachable
lives
and
were
quite
innocent
of
the
gross
charges
which
martin
senior
and
martin
junior
brought
against
them
the
bishop
of
lincoln
named
cooper
was
a
favourite
object
of
attack
and
the
pamphleteers
were
always
striving
to
make
the
cooper
hoops
to
flye
off
and
his
tubs
to
leake
out
in
the
to
the
terrible
they
tell
us
of
a
parson
who
being
in
the
pulpit
and
hearing
his
dog
cry
he
out
with
the
text
how
now
hoe
can
you
not
let
my
dog
alone
there
come
springe
come
springe
and
whistled
the
dog
to
the
pulpit
martin
marprelate
was
treated
by
some
according
to
his
folly
and
was
scoffed
in
many
pamphlets
by
the
wits
of
the
age
in
language
similar
to
that
which
he
was
so
fond
of
using
thus
we
have
of
england
to
martin
junior
in
a
countercuffe
given

marre
prelates
and
similar
publications
archbishop
whitgift
proceeded
against
these
authors
with
much
severity
in
a
proclamation
was
issued
against
them
several
were
taken
and
punished
udal
and
penry
who
were
the
chief
authors
of
these
outrageous
works
were
executed
hacket
coppinger
and
arthington
who
seem
to
have
been
a
trio
of
insane
libellers
and
greenwood
and
barrow
whose
seditious
books
and
pamphlets
were
leading
the
way
to
all
the
horrors
of
anarchy
introduced
by
the
anabaptists
into
germany
and
the
netherlands
all
felt
the
vengeance
of
the
star
chamber
and
were
severely
punished
for
their
revilings
the
innocent
often
suffer
with
the
guilty
and
cartwright
was
imprisoned
for
eighteen
months
although
he
denied
all
connection
with
the
marprelate
books
and
declared
that
he
had
never
written
or
published
anything
which
could
be
offensive
to

majesty
or
detrimental
to
the
state
the
solomon
of
the
north
and
the
parliament
of
england
dealt
hard
justice
to
the
which
nearly
caused
its
death
he
published
also
juris
anglicani
ad
seriem
institutionum
cambridge
which
involved
him
in
a
charge
of
wishing
to
confound
the
english
with
the
roman
law
cowell
in

former
work
sounded

which
was
heard
a
few
years
later
on
many
a
field
when
the
strength
of
the
crown
and
parliament
met
in
deadly
combat
he
contended
for
the
absolute
monarchy
of
the
king
of
england
his
writings
are
especially
valuable
as
illustrating
our
national
customs
the
author
says
my
true
end
is
the
advancement
of
knowledge
and
therefore
i
have
published
this
poor
work
not
only
to
impart
the
good
thereof
to
those
young
ones
who
want
it
but
also
to
draw
from
the
learned
the
supply
of
my
defects
what
a
man
saith
well
is
not
however
to
be
rejected
because
he
hath
many
errors
reprehend
who
will
in
god
name
that
is
with
sweetness
and
without
reproach
so
shall
he
reap
hearty
thanks
at
my
hands
and
thus
more
soundly
help
in
a
few
months
than
i
by
tossing
and
tumbling
my
books
at
home
could
possibly
have
done
in
many
years
the
sir
edward
coke
was
the
determined
foe
of
the
unhappy
doctor
endeavouring
to
ridicule
him
by
calling
him
cowheel
then
telling
the
king
that
the
book
limited
the
supreme
power
of
the
royal
prerogative
and
when
that
failed
he
accused
our
author
to
the
parliament
of
the
opposite
charge
of
betraying
the
liberties
of
the
people
at
length
cowell
was
condemned
by
the
house
to
imprisonment
james
issued
a
proclamation
against
the
book
but
saved
its
author
from
the
hangman
however
fuller
states
that
cowell
death
which
occurred
soon
after

was

by
the
troubles
in

punishment
to

to
deter

from
venturing

maiming
an

cutting
off
his

seems
to
have
been
a
favourite
method
of

in

cut
off
for

deemed

selden
had
a

affection
for

enraged

declared
the
unlawfulness
of

commission

for
calling
out

founded
upon
an
ancient
act
of

selden
said
had
been
repealed
when
lord

wrote
a
friendly
letter
to
remonstrate
with
him
he
replied
courteously
and
frankly

arguments

parliamentarians
who
wished
to
summon
the

without

authority

with
equal
impartiality
and
vigour
selden
declared
the
illegality
of
this
measure
and
expected
that
the

would
have
rejected
it
but
he
found
that
they
who
suffered
themselves
to
be
entirely
governed
by
his
reason
when
those
conclusions
resulted
from

which

not

that

the
mother

of

when

where

he
found
a

company
of

enemies
the

behind

they
demanded
from
him
an
immediate
retractation
of
all
the

in

the
drawn
daggers
were
arguments
which
our
unhappy
author
was
unable
to
resist
as
a
reward
for
all
his
labour
and
hard
study
he
was

to
live
as
an
exile

he
strenuously
obeyed

been
so
great
an
ornament
in
his
latter

richer

were
his
only
comfort

not
fretted
by
any
ambition

by
his
grief

unjust
fate

condemned
to
imprisonment
at

on
account
of
his
insane
book

there
were
no
asylums
for
lunatics
in
those
days
perhaps
that
was
the
wisest
course
his
judges
could
adopt
the
hostility
of
the
pope

authors
who
did
not
agree
with
his
political
views

been
excited
by
many
others
amongst
whom
we
may
mention

pietro
sarpi
born
at

joined
the
order
of
the
servites

paid
particular
veneration
to
the

that
order

satirical
writer
named
doni

the
most
distinguished
members
sarpi
adopted
the
name
of
paul
and
is
better
known
by
his
title
he
studied
history
and
wrote
several
works
in
defence
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
venetian
republic
against
the
arrogant
assumptions
of
pope
paul

venetians
were
proud
of
their
defender
and
made
him
their
consultant
theologian
and
a
member
of
the
famous
council
of
ten
but
the
spiritual
weapons
of

were
levied
against
the
bold
upholder
of

liberties

excommunicated

exasperated
the
papal
party
one
evening
in
the
following
year
as

was
returning
to
his
monastery
he
was
attacked
by
five
assassins
and
pierced
with
many
wounds
fell
dead
at
their
feet
the
authorship
of
this
crime
it
was
not
hard
to
discover
as
the
murderers
betook
themselves
to
the
house
of
the
papal
nuncio
and
thence
fled
to
rome
in
this
book
sarpi
vigorously
exposed
the
unlawfulness
and
injustice
of
the
power
of
excommunication
claimed
by
the
pope
and
showed
he
had
no
right
or
authority
to
proscribe
others
for
the
sake
of
his
own
advantage

a

himself
immured

gave
great
offence
to

his
chief
books
were

wrote
an
account

created
a
great
sensation
and
aroused
the
popular
indignation
against

was
only
appeased
with

alas
for

of
the

whose
madness
he
had
inspired

was
guillotined

indignantly
refused

having
failed
another
more
forcible
one
was
immediately
adopted
darigrand
was
sent

his

is
a
most
forcible
and
complete
exposure
of

horrible

of
extortion
torture
and
ruination
which
made
a

a

inevitable
authors
have
often
been
compelled
to

words
but
the
operation
has
seldom
been
performed

to
the
disastrous

christian
iv

it
was
not
a
very
excellent
work
neither
was
its
author
a
learned
or
accurate
historian
but
it
aroused
the
anger
of
the
swedes

there
he
remained
many
years

at
length
he
was
offered
his
freedom
on
the
condition
that
he
should
either
lose
his
head
or
eat
his
book
our
author
preferred
the
latter
alternative
and
with
admirable
cleverness
devoured
his
book
when
he
had
converted
it
into
a
sauce

his

his

count

was
jocose
his
wit
keen
and
his
sarcasm
severe
he
was
born
in
and
educated
at
a
college
of
jesuits
where
he
manifested
an
extraordinary
avidity
for
letters
and
precocious
talents
the
glory
of
war
fired
his
early
zeal
and
for
sixteen
years
he
followed
the
pursuit
of
arms
then
literature
claimed
him
as
her
slave
his
first
book
amours
du
palais
excited
the
displeasure
of
king
louis
and
prepared
the
way
for
his
downfall
in
his
amoureuse
des
paris
he
satirised
the
lax
manners
of
the
french
court
during
the
minority
of
the
king
and
had
the
courage
to
narrate
the
intrigue
which
louis
carried
on
with
la
vallière
he
spares
few
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
lashes
them
all
with
his
satire
amongst
others
mesdames
and
de
chatillon
unhappily
for
the
count
he
showed
the
book
when
it
was
yet
in
to
the
marchioness
de

his
intimate
friend
but
the
best
of
friends
sometimes
quarrel
and
unfortunately
the
count
and
the
good
lady
quarrelled
while
yet
the
was
in
her
possession
a
grand
opportunity
for
revenge
thus
presented
itself
she
showed
to
the
ladies
of
the
court
the
severe
verses
which
the
count
had
written
and
his
victims
were
so
enraged
that
they
carried
their
complaints
to
the
king

in

verses
beginning

this
aroused
the
anger
of

then
to
be
banished

for

passed
sixteen
years
in

and
occupied
his
enforced
leisure
by
writing
his
memoirs
mémoires
de

de

comte
de
paris
in
which
he
lauded
himself
amazingly
and
a
history
of
the
reign
of
louis
which
abounded
in
base
flattery
of
the
great
monarch
bussy
earned
the
title
of
the
french
petronius
by
lashing
with
his
satirical
pen
the
debaucheries
of
louis
and
his
court
after
the
same
manner
in
which
the
roman
philosopher
ridiculed
the
depravity
of
nero
and
his
satellites
his
style
was
always
elegant
and
his
satire
seemingly
so
playful
and
facetious
stung
his
victims
and
cut
them
to
the
quick
this
was
a
somewhat
dangerous
gift
to
the
man
who
wielded
the
whip
when
the
grand
monarch
felt
the
lash
twisting
around
his
royal
person
therefore
poor
bussy
was
compelled
to
end
his
days
in
exile
a
book
fatal
to
its
author
dassy
a
parisian
lawyer
was
one
which
bore
the
title
pour
le
baron
et
la
baronne
de
paris
it
attacked
titon
de
villotran
counsellor
of
the
grand
chamber
who
caused
its
author
to
be
arrested
the
book
created
some
excitement
and
contained
some
severe
criticisms
on
the
magistrates
and
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
as
well
as
on
the
aggrieved
villotran
parliament
confirmed
the
order
for
dassy
arrest
but
he
contrived
to
effect
his
escape
to
holland
he
was
a
rich
man
who
did
much
to
relieve
and
assist
the
poor
while
he
delighted
to
attack
and
satirise
the
prosperous
and
the
great
the
italian
satirist
trajan
boccalini
born
at
loretto
in
was
also
one
upon
whom
court
favour
shone
he
was
surrounded
by
a
host
of
friends
and
admirers
and
was
appointed
governor
of
the
states
of
the
church
he
was
one
of
the
wittiest
and
most
versatile
of
authors
and
would
have
risen
to
positions
of
greater
dignity
if
only
his
pen
had
been
a
little
less
active
and
his
satire
less
severe
he
wrote
a
book
entitled
di
which
was
most
successful
in
this
work
he
represents
apollo
as
judge
of
parnassus
who
cites
before
him
kings
authors
warriors
statesmen
and
other
mighty
personages
minutely
examines
their
faults
and
crimes
and
passes
judgment
upon
them
inasmuch
as
these
people
whom
apollo
condemned
were
his
contemporaries
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
book
created
no
small
stir
and
aroused
the
wrath
of
the
victims
of
his
satire
boccalini
was
compelled
to
leave
rome
and
seek
safety
in
venice
he
also
wrote
a
bitter
satire
upon
the
spanish
misrule
in
italy
entitled
del
paragone
in
this
book
he
showed
that
the
power
of
the
king
of
spain
in
italy
was
not
so
great
as
men
imagined
and
that
it
would
be
easy
to
remove
the
spanish
yoke
from
their
necks
in
venice
he
imagined
himself
safe
but
his
powerful
foes
hired
assassins
to
remove
the
obnoxious
author
he
was
seized
one
day
by
four
strong
men
cast
upon
a
couch
and
beaten
to
death
with
bags
filled
with
sand
the
elegance
of
his
style
his
witticisms
and
fine
satire
have
earned
for
boccalini
the
title
of
the
italian
lucian
to
scoff
at
the
powerful
jesuits
was
not
always
a
safe
pastime
as
pierre
billard
discovered
who
on
account
of
his
work
entitled
bête
à
sept
was
sent
to
the
bastille
and
subsequently
to
the
prisons
of
and
the
society
objected
to
be
compared
to
the
beast
and
were
powerful
enough
to
ruin
their
bold
assailant
who
died
at
charenton
in
another
italian
satirist
pietro
aretino
acquired
great
fame
but
not
of
a
creditable
kind
born
at
arezzo
in
he
followed
the
trade
of
a
bookbinder
but
not
confining
his
labour
to
the
external
adornment
of
books
he
acquired
some
knowledge
of
letters
he
began
his
career
by
writing
a
satirical
sonnet
against
indulgences
and
was
compelled
to
fly
from
his
native
place
and
wander
through
italy
at
rome
he
found
a
temporary
where
he
was
employed
by
popes
leo
and
clement
vii
then
he
wrote
sixteen
gross
sonnets
on
the
sixteen
obscene
pictures
of
giulio
romano

were
published
under

title
of

the
work
of
marc
antonio
of

were
no
less
scandalous
than
the
sonnets
and
the
engraver
was
ordered
to
be
arrested
by
pope
clement
and
only
escaped
punishment
by
flight
which
were
so
intolerable
that
he
was
again
forced
to
fly
and
seek
an
asylum
at
milan
under
the
protection
of
the
black
band
led
by
the
famous
captain
giovanni
de
medici
on
the
death
of
this
leader
he
repaired
to
venice
where
he
lived
by
his
pen
he
began
a
series
of
satires
on
princes
and
leading
men
and
earned
the
title
of
aretino
adopted
the
iniquitous
plan
of
demanding
gifts
from
those
he
proposed
to
attack
in
order
that
by
these
bribes
they
might
appease
the
libeller
and
avert
his
onslaught
others
employed
him
to
libel
their
enemies
thus
the
satirist
throve
and
waxed
rich
and
prosperous
his
book
entitled
was
a
rude
and
obscene
collection
of
satires
on
great
men
his
prolific
pen
poured
forth
sonnets
and
mingled
with
a
mass
of
discreditable
and
licentious
works
we
find
several
books
on
morality
and
theology
these
he
wrote
not
from
any
sense
of
piety
and
devotion
but
simply
for
gain
while
his
immoral
life
was
a
strange
contrast
to
his
teaching
he
published
a
paraphrase
on
the
seven
penitential
psalms
venice
and
a
work
entitled
humanitate
sive

calling
himself
aretino

by
favour
of

utterly
venal
and
unscrupulous
we
find
him
at
one
time
enjoying
the
patronage
of
francis
of
france
and
then
abusing
that
monarch
and
basking
in
the
favour
of
the
emperor

paid
him

lavishly

at

in

say
that

was
beaten

by

narrate
that

who
laughed
at
others
all
his
life
died
through
laughter
his
risible
faculties
being
on
one
occasion
so
violently
excited
by
certain
obscene
jests
he
fell
from
his
seat
and
struck
his
head
with
such
violence
against
the
ground
that
he
died
the
town
of
zürich
was
startled
in
the
fifteenth
century
by
finding
itself
the
object
of
the
keen
satire
of
one
of
its
canons
felix
hemmerlin
who
wrote
a
book
entitled

the
clergy
both
regular
and
secular
were
also
subjected
to
his
criticism
the
book
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
is
a
dialogue
nobilitate
et
and
the
second
is
a
treatise
against
the
mendicant
friars
monks
beghards
and
béguines
the
town
of
zürich
was
very
indignant
at
this
bold
attack
and
deprived
the
poor
author
of
his
benefices
and
of
his
liberty
italian
air
seems
to
have
favoured
satire
but
italian
susceptibility
was
somewhat
fatal
to
the
satirists
giovanni
cinelli
born
in
taught
medicine
at
florence
and
was
illustrious
for
his
literary
productions
he
allied
himself
with
antonio
magliabecchi
who
afforded
him
opportunities
of
research
in
the
library
of
the
grand
duke
he
began
the
great
work
entitled

fourth
section

brought
grievous
trouble
upon
its
author
it
was
all
caused
by
an
unfortunate
note
which
attacked
the
doctor
of
the
grand
duke
this
doctor
was
highly
indignant
and
reported
cinelli
to
the
tribunal
the
book
was
publicly
burnt
by
the
hangman
and
cinelli
was
confined
in
prison
days
and
then
driven
into
exile
his
misfortunes
roused
his
anger
and
he
published
at
his
retreat
at
venice
a
bitter
satire
on
men
of
all
ranks
entitled
di
giovanni
exciting
much
hostility
against
him
he
died
at
the
age
of
seventy
years
in
the
castle
of
san
lorenzo
and
his
was
continued
and
completed
by
sancassani
under
the
fictitious
name
of
philoponis
nicholas
francus
an
italian
poet
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
a
graceful
writer
and
very
skilled
in
the
latin
greek
and
etruscan
languages
but
incurred
a
grievous
fate
on
account
of
his
severe
satire
on
pope
pius
iv
the
stern
persecutor
of
carranza
the
powerful
archbishop
of
toledo
was
not
a
person
to
be
attacked
with
impunity
the
cause
of
the
poet
resentment
against
the
pope
was
the
prohibition
of
a
certain
work
entitled
which
francus
had
commenced
describing
the
feasts
of
priapus
pius
iv
refused
to
allow
the
poet
to
complete
his
book
and
ordered
that
which
he
had
already
written
to
be
burned
this
was
too
much
for
the
equanimity
of
the
poet
whose
eye
was
with
fine
frenzy
rolling
and
he
began
to
assail
the
pope
with
all
manner
of
abuse
for
some
time
the
punishment
for
his
rash
writing
was
postponed
on
account
of
the
protection
of
a
powerful
cardinal
but
on
the
death
of
pius
iv
francus
sharpened
his
pen
afresh
and
sorely
wounded
the
memory
of
his
deceased
foe
in
one
of
his
satires
the
words
of
john
gospel
caro
factum
were
inserted
and
the
charge
of
profanity
was
brought
against
him
at
length
pius
condemned
him
to
death
some
historians
narrate
that
the
poor
poet
was
hung
on
a
beam
attached
to
the
famous
statue
of
the
gladiator
in
front
of
the
palace
of
the
orsini
called
the
pasquin
to
which
the
deriders
and
enemies
of
the
pope
were
accustomed
to
affix
their
epigrams
and
pamphlets
these
were
called
from
the
curious
method
adopted
for
their
publication
others
declare
that
he
suffered
punishment
in
a
funereal
chamber
draped
with
black
while
another
authority
declares
that
the
poet
the
victim
of
his
own
satires
was
hung
on
a
gibbet
not
on
account
of
his
abuse
of
pius
but
through
the
hatred
of
pius
which
some
personal
quarrel
had
excited
this
conjecture
is
however
probably
false
francus
was
a
true
poet
endowed
with
a
vivid
imagination
and
with
a
delicate
and
subtle
wit
he
scorned
the
coarse
invective
in
which
the
satirists
of
his
day
used
to
delight
he
had
many
enemies
on
account
of
his
words
and
keen
criticisms
the
problem
which
perplexed
the
patriarch
job
the
happiness
of
prosperous
vice
the
misery
of
persecuted
virtue
tormented
his
mind
and
called
forth
his
embittered
words
he
inveighed
against
the
reprobates
and
fools
the
crowds
of
monsignors
who
were
as
vain
of
their
effeminacy
as
the
scipios
of
their
deeds
of
valour
he
combated
abuses
and
with
indignant
pen
heaped
scorn
upon
the
fashionable
vices
of
the
age
the
pope
and
his
cardinals
stung
by
his
shafts
of
satire
cruelly
avenged
themselves
upon
the
unhappy
poet
and
as
we
have
said
doomed
him
to
death
in
the
year
his
dialogues
were
printed
in
venice
by
zuliani
in
under
the
title

valla
born
at
rome
in
was
one
of
the
greatest
scholars
of
his
age
and
contributed
more
than
any
other
man
to
the
revival
of
the
love
of
latin
literature
in
the
fifteenth
century
his
works
are
voluminous
he
translated
into

of

and
wrote
sermonis
a
history
of
ferdinand
aragon
paris
and
many
other
works
which
are
the
monuments
of
his
learning
and
industry
but
valla
raised
against
him
many
enemies
by
the
severity
of
his
satire
on
almost
all
the
learned
men
of
his
time
he
spared
no
one
and
least
of
all
the
clerics
who
sought
his
destruction
a
friend
advised
him
that
unless
he
was
weary
of
life
he
ought
to
avoid
heaping
his
satirical
abuse
on
the
roman
priests
and
bishops
he
published
a
work
on
the
pretended
donation
of
constantine
to
the
papal
see
and
for
this
and
other
writings
pronounced
heretical
by
the
inquisition
he
was
cast
into
prison
and
would
have
suffered
death
by
fire
had
not
his
powerful
friend
alphonso
king
of
aragon
rescued
him
from
the
merciless
holy
office
valla
was
compelled
publicly
to
renounce
his
heretical
opinions
and
then
within
the
walls
of
a
monastery
his
hands
having
been
bound
he
was
beaten
with
rods
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
valla
further
he
was
engaged
in
a
long
controversy
with
the
learned
men
of
his
time
especially
with
the
facetious
poggio
whose
wit
was
keener

his
language
was
not
so
forcible

in
his

did
he

he
spoke
the
truth
too
severely

at

made
a
playful
allusion
to

the
of

pallavicino
lived
in
safety
for
some
time
at
venice
braving
the
anger
of
his
enemies
unfortunately
he
wished
to
retire
to
france
and
during
his
journey
passed
through
the
territory
of
the
pope
he
was
accompanied
by
a
frenchman
one
charles
morfu
who
pretended
great
friendship
for
him
admired
his
works
and
scoffed
at
the
barberini
with
jests
as
keen
as
the
canon
own
satires
but
the
frenchman
betrayed
him
to
his
foes
and
poor
pallavicino
paid
the
penalty
of
his
rashness
by
a
cruel
death
in
the
papal
palace
at
avignon
at
the
early
age
of
years
his
strictures
on
urban
and
his
family
were
well
deserved
the
pope
heaped
riches
and
favours
on
his
relations
he
made
three
of
his
nephews
cardinals
and
the
fourth
was
appointed
general
of
the
papal
troops
so
odious
did
the
family
make
themselves
by
their
exactions
that
on
the
death
of
urban
they
were
forced
to
leave
rome
and
take
refuge
in
france
pallavicino
had
certainly
fitting
subjects
for
his
satirical
verses
françois

on
account
of
his
poems
entitled

ou

sur
toutes

his
satire
was
very
biting
and
not
a
little
scurrilous
and
was
famous
for
the
quantity
rather
than
the
quality
of
his
poetical
effusions
we
give
the
following
example
of
his
skill
in
which
he
discourses
upon
the
different
effects
which

produces

the
literary
world
of
paris
in
was
very
much
disturbed
by
certain
satirical
verses
which
seemed
to
come
from
an
unknown
hand
and
empty
cafés
as
if
with
the
magic
of
a
bomb
the
café
de
la
laurent
was
the
famous
resort
of
the
writers
of
the
time
where
rousseau
and
lamothe
reigned
as
chiefs
of
the
literary
parnassus
amid
a
throng
of
poets
politicians
and
wits
some
malcontent
poet
thought
fit
to
disturb
the
harmony
of
this
brilliant
company
by
publishing
some
very
satirical
couplets
directed
against
the
frequenters
of
the
café
this
so
enraged
the
company
that
they
deserted
the
unfortunate
café
and
selected
another
for
their
rendezvous
but
other
verses
still
more
severe
followed
them
jean
baptist
rousseau
was
suspected
as
their
author
he
denied
the
supposition
and
accused
saurin
but
rousseau
was
found
to
be
guilty
and
was
banished
from
the
kingdom
for
ever
as
the
author
and
distributer
of
certain
impure
and
satirical
verses
amongst
satirical
writers
who
have
suffered
hard
fates
we
must
mention
the
illustrious
author
of
daniel
defoe
a
strong
partisan
of
the
nonconformist
cause
during
the
controversial
struggle
between
church
and
dissent
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
he
published
a
pamphlet
entitled
shortest
way
with
the
in
which
he
ironically
advised
their
entire
extermination
this
pleased
certain
of
the
church
party
who
had
not
learned
the
duty
of
charity
towards
the
opinions
of
others
nor
the
advantages
of
religious
liberty
nor
were
they
singular
in
this
respect
as
the
dissenting
party
had
plainly
shown
when
the
power
was
in
their
hands
happily
wiser
counsels
prevail
now
when
defoe
jest
was
discovered
and
his
opponents
found
that
the
book
was
writ
sarcastic
they
caused
the
unhappy
author
to
be
severely
punished
parliament
condemned
his
book
to
the
flames
and
its
author
to
the
pillory
and
to
prison
on
his
release
he
wrote
other
political
pamphlets
which
involved
him
in
new
troubles
and
disgusted
with
politics
he
turned
his
versatile
talents
to
other
literary
work
and
produced
his
immortal
book
which
has
been
translated
into
all
languages
and
is
known
and
read
by
every
one
young
might
not
be
considered
a
suitable
form
of
poem
for
parody
but
this
durosoi
or
du
rosoi
accomplished
in
his
jours
and
was
sent
to
the
bastille
for
his
pains
the
cause
of
his
condemnation
was
that
he
had
published
this
work
without
permission
and
also
perhaps
on
account
of
certain
political
allusions
contained
in
his
second
work

in

a
worse
fate
awaited

dangerous
years

for
him

brought
about
his
death
when

fatal
tenth
of
august
came

editor

not
to
be
found
in
paris
however
ultimately
he
was
secured
and
condemned
to
death
by
the
tribunal
extraordinary
appointed
by
the
legislative
assembly
to
judge
the
enemies

all
the
venom

to
have
been

beverland
wandering
away
from

he
was

at

in

studied
letters
at

university
of
leyden
he
began
his
career
by
publishing
indecent
poems
he
wrote
a
very
iniquitous
book
peccato
in
which
he
gave
a
very
base
explanation
of
the
sin
of
our
first
parents
and
although
considerable
licence
was
allowed
to
authors
in

at
that
time
nevertheless
the
magistrates

professors
of
leyden
condemned
the
book
to
be
burned

to

of

not
charitably
committed
it
to

been
pronounced

pamphlets
being
exiled
on

of
the
indecency
of
his
writings
he
came
to
england
where
he
affected
decorum
and
his
friend
and
countryman
isaac
vossius
who
enjoyed
the
patronage
of
charles

and
was
canon
of
windsor
obtained
for
him

although
beverland
wrote
another
book
footnote
fornicatione
cavendâ
admonitio

with
the
apparent
intention
of
warning
against
vice
the
argument
seemed
to
inculcate
the
lusts
which
he
condemned
having
become
insane
he
died
in
extreme
poverty
in
he
imagined

an
early
poet
who
suffered
death
on
account
of
his
writings
was
cecco
professor
of
astrology
at
the
famous
university
of
bologna
in
his
poems
have
been
collected
and
published
under
the
title
poetiche
del
illustro
poeta
cecco
cioë
in
venetia
per
philippum

et
socios

the
printer
of
this
work
philippus
condam
petri
philippo
de
piero
veneto
is
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
famous
of
venetian
printers
and
produced
several
of
the
incunabula
which
we
now
prize
so
highly
the
absurdities
of
cecco
contained
in
his
poems
merited
for
their
author
a
place
in
a
lunatic
asylum
rather
than
on
a
funeral
pile
he
was
however
burnt
alive
at
bologna
in
he
believed
in
the
influence
of
evil
spirits
who
under
certain
constellations
had
power
over
the
affairs
of
men
that
our
saviour
jesus
christ
was
born
under
a
certain
constellation
which
obliged
him
to
poverty
whereas
antichrist
would
come
into
the
world
under
a
certain
planet
which
would
make
him
enormously
wealthy
he
continued
to
proclaim
these
amazing
delusions
at
bologna
and
was
condemned
by
the
inquisition
the
poet
escaped
punishment
by
submission
and
repentance
but
two
years
later
he
announced
to
the
duke
of
calabria
who
asked
him
to
cast
the
horoscope
of
his
wife
and
daughter
that
they
would
betake
themselves
to
an
infamous
course
of
life
this
prophecy
was
too
much
for
the
duke
cecco
was
again
summoned
to
appear
before
the
inquisitors
who
condemned
him
to
the
stake
at
his
execution
a
large
crowd
assembled
to
see
whether
his
familiar
genii
would
arrest
the
progress
of
the
flames
the
poet
real
name
was
françois
de
stabili
cecco
being
a
diminutive
form
of
francesco
there
are
many
editions
of
his
work
the
lunatic
and
the
poet
were
certainly
in
his
case
not
far
removed
a
very
different
man
was
the
illustrious
author
and
historian
of
scotland
george
buchanan
who
was
born
in
after
studying
in
paris
he
returned
to
scotland
and
became
tutor
of
the
earl
of
murray
the
natural
son
of
james
the
franciscan
monks
were
not
very
popular
at
this
period
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
king
buchanan
wrote
a
satirical
poem
entitled
in
which
he
censured
the
degenerate
followers
of
francis
and
harassed
them
in
many
ways
this
poem
so
enraged
the
monks
that
they
seized
him
and
imprisoned
him
in
one
of
their
monasteries
one
night
while
his
guards
slept
he
contrived
to
escape
by
a
window
and
underwent
great
perils
he
published
two
other
severe
satirical
poems
on
the
franciscans
entitled
and
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
follow
his
fortunes
further
as
buchanan
history
is
well
known
after
teaching
at
paris
bordeaux
and
at
coimbre
in
portugal
he
returned
to
scotland
and
was
entrusted
by
mary
queen
of
scots
with
the
education
of
her
son
buchanan
then
embraced
protestantism
opposed
the
queen
in
the
troubles
which
followed
and
received
from
parliament
the
charge
of
the
future
solomon
of
the
north
james
vi
of
scotland
and
of
england
he
devoted
his
later
life
to
historical
studies
and
produced
his
famous
of
in
twelve
books
maria
regina
ejusque
in
which
he
attacked
the
reputation
of
the
queen
and
jure
regni
apud
a
book
remarkable
for
the
liberalism
of
the
ideas
which
were
therein
expressed
his
royal
pupil
did
not
treat
buchanan
history
with
due
respect
he
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
at
the
merkat
cross
and
ordered
every
one
to
bring
his
copy
to
be
perused
and
purged
of
the
offensive
and
extraordinary
matters
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
university
of
oxford
ordered
jure
together
with
certain
other
works
to
be
publicly
burnt
on
account
of
certain
obnoxious
propositions
deducible
from
them
such
as
wicked
kings
and
tyrants
ought
to
be
put
to
death
he
published
a
paraphrase
of
the
psalms
of
david
in
verse
which
has
been
much
praised
the
jesuits
were
not
very
friendly
critics
of
our
author
for
they
asserted
that
buchanan
showed
in
his
life
little
of
the
piety
of
david
and
stated
that
during
thirty
years
he
did
not
deliver
a
single
sermon
even
on
sundays
but
who
is
ignorant
observes
klotz
of
the
lust
of
these
men
for
calumny
another
poet
had
occasion
to
adopt
the
same
mode
of
escape
which
buchanan
successfully
accomplished
but
with
less
happy
results
this
was
nicodemus
frischlin
a
german
poet
and
philosopher
born
in
the
duchy
of
würtemberg
in
at
an
early
age
he
showed
great
talents
honours
clustered
thickly
on
his
brow
at
the
age
of
twenty
years
he
was
made
professor
of
at
tubingen
he
received
from
the
emperor
rudolph
the
poetic
crown
with
the
title
of
and
was
made
count
palatin
as
a
reward
for
his
three
panegyrics
composed
in
honour
of
the
emperors
of
the
house
of
austria
certainly
fortune
smiled
upon
her
favourite
but
envy
raised
up
many
enemies
who
were
eager
to
find
occasion
against
the
successful
poet
he
afforded
them
a
pretext
in
his
work
laudibus
vitae
which
in
spite
of
its
innocent
title
grievously
offended
the
nobles
who
were
already
embittered
against
him
on
account
of
his
arrogance
and
turbulence
and
his
keen
and
unsparing
satire
so
bitter
was
their
hostility
that
the
poet
was
compelled
to
leave
tubingen
and
became
a
wandering
philosopher
sometimes
teaching
in
schools
always
pouring
forth
poems
elegies
satires
tragedies
comedies
and
epics
being
eager
to
publish
some
of
his
works
and
not
having
sufficient
means
he
applied
to
the
duke
of
würtemberg
for
a
subsidy
at
the
same
time
furiously
attacking
his
old
opponents
this
so
exasperated
the
chief
men
of
the
court
that
they
persuaded
the
duke
to
recall
frischlin
but
instead
of
finding
a
welcome
from
his
old
patron
he
was
cast
into
prison
in
order
that
he
might
unlearn
his
presumption
and
acquire
the
useful
knowledge
that
modesty
is
the
chief
ornament
of
a
learned
man
but
frischlin
did
not
agree
with
another
poet
assertion
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
having
raged
and
stormed
and
tried
in
vain
to
obtain
release
he
resolved
to
escape
from
his
prison
window
he
let
himself
down
by
a
rope
made
out
of
his
but
unfortunately
the
rope
broke
and
the
poor
poet
fell
upon
the
hard
rocks
beneath
his
chamber
window
and
was
injured
fatally
frischlin
was
considered
one
of
the
best
latin
poets
of
times
but
his
genius
was
marred
by
his
immoderate
and
bitter
temper
which
caused
him
to
imagine
that
the
gentle
banter
and
jocular
remarks
of
his
acquaintances
were
insults
to
be
repaid
by
angry
invective
and
bitter
sarcasm
with
which
his
writings
abound
clement
marot
was
one
of
the
most
famous
of
early
french
poets
and
the
creator
of
the
school
of
naïve
poetry
in
which
la
fontaine
afterwards
so
remarkably
excelled
his
poetical
version
of
the
psalms
was
read
and
sung
in
many
lands
and
in
spite
of
prohibition
copies
could
not
be
printed
so
fast
as
they
were
eagerly
bought
they
were
at
one
time
as
popular
in
the
court
of
henry
ii
of
france
as
they
were
amongst
the
calvinists
of
geneva
and
holland
in
we
find
him
fighting
in
the
duke
of
alençon
army
when
he
was
wounded
at
the
battle
of
pavia
then
his
verses
caused
their
author
suffering
and
he
was
imprisoned
on
the
charge
of
holding
heretical
opinions
his
epistles
in
poetry
written
to
the
king
contain
a
record
of
his
life
his
fear
of
imprisonment
his
flight
his
arrest
by
his
enemies
of
the
sorbonne
his
release
by
order
of
the
king
and
his
protestations
of
orthodoxy
but
he
seems
to
have
adopted
the
principles
of
the
reformation
and
france
was
no
safe
place
for
him
in
geneva
and
piedmont
he
found
and
died
in
his
translation
of
the
psalms
into
harmonious
verse
which
was
sung
both
by
the
peasants
and
the
learned
was
the
cause
of
his
persecution
by
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
he
complains
bitterly
to
the
lyons
printer
dolet
that
many
obscene
and
unworthy
poems
were
ascribed
to
him
and
printed
amongst
his
works
of
which
he
was
not
the
author
as
an
example
of
his
verse
i
quote
the
beginning
of

it
is
not
often
that
a
poet
loses
his
head
for
a
single
couplet
but
this
seems
to
have
been
the
fate
of
caspar
weiser
professor
of
lund
in
sweden
at
first
he
showed
great
loyalty
to
his
country
and
wrote
a
panegyric
on
the
coronation
of
charles
king
of
sweden
but
a
short
time
afterwards
he
appears
to
have
changed
his
political
opinions
for
when
the
city
was
captured
by
the
danes
in
weiser
met
the
conqueror
and
greeted
him
with
the
words
triumphator
reliquas
submittere

sic
redit
ad
dominum
quod
fuit
ante
this
verse
was
fatal
to
him
the
swedish
monarch
recovered
his
lost
territory
the
danes
were
expelled
and
the
poor
poet
was
accused
of
treason
and
beheaded
the
same
hard
fate
befell
john
williams
in
who
was
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
on
account
of
two
poems
and
the
mss
of
which
he
foolishly
sent
secretly
in
a
box
to

james
the
monarch

always
fearful
of
assassination
and
as
one
of
the
poems
foretold
his
speedy
decease
the
prophet
incurred
the
wrath
and
suffered
death
for
his
pains
a
single
poem
was
fatal
to

en
it
commences
with
the
following
lines
peuple

servile

he
happened
to
be
present
at
the
opera
house
in
paris
when
the
young
pretender
was
arrested
and
being
indignant
at
this
breach
of
hospitality
and
believing
that
the
honour
of
the
nation
had
been
compromised
he
wrote
these
bitter
verses
his
punishment
was
severe
he
was
arrested
and
conducted
to
the
gloomy
fortress
of
where
he
remained
for
three
long
years
shut
up
in
the
cage
the
floor
of
this
terrible
prison
which
was
enveloped
in
perpetual
darkness
was
only
eight
square
feet
the
poor
poet
bore
his
sufferings
patiently
and
was
befriended
by
de
broglie
abbé
of
who
obtained
permission
for
him
to
leave
his
cage
and
be
imprisoned
in
the
abbey
nor
did
he
fail
to
take
precautions
lest
the
poor
poet
should
lose
his
eyesight
on
passing
from
the
darkness
of
the
dungeon
to
the
light
of
day
the
good
abbé
finally
procured
liberty
for
his
captive
who
became
secretary
to
de
broglie
brother
and
subsequently
on
the
death
of
madame
de
pompadour
commissioner
of
war
terrible
were
the
sufferings
which
the
unhappy
deforges
endured
on
account
of
his
luckless
poem

condemned
to
be
burned
at

on
account
of
his
book

but
he
contrived
to
effect
his
escape
he
was
ultimately
captured
in
picardy
and
put
in
a
dungeon
he
was
banished
from
the
kingdom
by
order
of
the
parliament
in
his
old
age
he
found
an
asylum
in
the
house
of

the

impromptu

attributed
to

his
poems
are
a
mere
collection
of
impieties
and
obscenities
published
with
the
greatest
impudence
and
well
deserved
their
destruction
on
one
occasion
he
travelled
to
holland
with
balzac
and
used
this
opportunity
for
bringing
out
an
infamous
charge
against
him
which
he
had
most
probably
invented

book

cause
of
all
his

scandalous

be
written
on

may
mention

designed
a
beautiful
engraving
for

not
knowing
for

purpose
it
was
intended
also
incurred
great
risks
but
fortunately
he
escaped
with
no
greater
penalty
than
the
breaking
of
the
plate
on
which
he
had
engraved

with
the
author
some
think
that

was
burnt
at

with
his
books

from

paths
matteo
palmieri
was
a
celebrated
italian
historian
born
at
florence
in
he
was
a
man
of
much
learning
endowed
with
great
powers
of
energy
and
perseverance
he
was
entrusted
with
several
important
embassies
and
achieved
fame
as
an
historian
by
his
vast
work
in
which
he
set
himself
the
appalling
task
of
writing
the
history
of
the
world
from
the
creation
to
his
own
time
the
first
part
of
this
work
consisting
of
extracts
from
the
writings
of
eusebius
and
prosper
remains
unpublished
the
rest
first
saw
the
light
in
and
subsequent
editions
appeared
at
venice
in
and
at
basle
in
and
he
wrote
also
four
books
on
the
pisan
war
would
that
he
had
confined
himself
to
his
histories
unfortunately
he
wrote
a
poem
which
was
never
published
entitled
representing
the
soul
released
from
the
chains
of
the
body
and
freed
from
earthly
stain
wandering
through
various
places
and
at
last
resting
amid
the
company
of
the
blessed
in
heaven
our
souls
are
angels
who
in
the
revolt
of
lucifer
were
unwilling
to
attach
themselves
either
to
god
or
to
the
rebel
hosts
of
heaven
so
as
a
punishment
god
made
them
dwell
in
mortal
bodies
in
a
state
of
probation
this
work
was
considered
tainted
with
the
manichaean
heresy
and
was
condemned
to
the
flames
and
some
assert
that
palmieri
shared
the
fate
of
his
book
this
however
is
doubtful
very
fatal
to
himself
were
the
odes
and
philippics
of
la

written
in
and
published
in
paris
in
with
the
title
philippiques

in
these
poems
he
attacked
with
malignant
fury
the
duke
of
orleans
regent
of
france
and
was
obliged
to
fly
for
safety
to
avignon
there
he
was
betrayed
by
a
false
friend
who
persuaded
him
to
walk
into
french
territory
and
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
a
band
of
soldiers
prepared
for
his
capture
the
poet
was
conducted
to
the
isle
of
ste
marguerite
and
confined
in
a
dungeon
the
governor
of
the
castle
was
enchanted
by
his
talents
and
gaiety
and
gave
him
great
liberty
but
le
grange
pen
was
still
restless
he
must
needs
make
a
bitter
epigram
upon
his
kind
benefactor
which
so
aroused
the
governor
ire
that
the
poet
was
sent
back
to
his
dungeon
cell
a
piteous
ode
addressed
to
the
regent
imploring
pardon
secured
for
him
a
less
rigorous
confinement
he
succeeded
in

of

his
productions
were
certainly
infamous
and
scandalous
but
that
was
no
reason
why
the

should
have
been
hanged
moreover

the
manner
of

curious
and
serves
as
a
warning
to
incautious
bards
leaving
his
chamber

opened

window

unfortunately
a
strong
gust
of
wind
carried
several

table
into

the
methods
of
later
critics
are
less
severe
than
their
inquisitorial
predecessors

not
been
without
their
victims

books
maltreated
by

sometimes
done

that
it
was

rapid
consumption
ensued

the
succeeding
acknowledgments
from
more
candid
critics
of
the
true
greatness
of

powers
were
ineffectual
to
heal
the
wound
thus
wantonly
inflicted
it
may
be
well
said
that
these
wretched

they
do

their
slanders

the
antiquary

though
not
a
poet
was
a
great
writer
on

and
our
early
english
songs
and
ballads
complained
bitterly
of
the
ignorant
reviewers
and
described
himself
as

spirits
certain
to

insulted
by
a
base
and

gang
of

assassins

venomous

proverbial

not
usually

critics
can
still
be
severe
enough
but
they
are
just
and
generous
and
never

that
scurrilous
personal
abuse
of

antoine
danchet
was
one
of
the
most
famous
of
french
dramatic
writers
although
his
poetry
was
not
of
a
very
high
order
and
lacked
energy
and
colour
he
was
born
at
riom
in
auvergne
in
he
distinguished
himself
at
the
college
of
the
oratorian
fathers
and
soon
came
to
paris
to
become
a
teacher
of
youths
and
to
finish
his
studies
at
the
jesuit
college
at
a
very
early
age
he
manifested
a
great
love
of
poetry
and
when
he
used
to
recite
the
whole
of
horace
he
was
rewarded
by
a
wealthy
patron
with
a
present
of
thirty
he
bore
so
noble
a
character
and
had
such
a
reputation
for
learning
that
a
certain
noble
lady
on
her
entrusted
him
with
the
charge
of
her
two
sons
giving
him
a
pension
of
two
hundred
livres
on
the
condition
that
he
should
never
leave
them
soon
after
her
death
he
was
ordered
to
write
some
verses
for
a
ballet
produced
at
court
this
led
him
to
acquire
a
taste
for
the
theatre
and
he
produced
in
an
opera
entitled
which
met
with
a
great
success
the
relations
of
his
pupils
were
aroused
it
was
scandalous
that
a
teacher
of
youths
should
write
plays
all
the
arguments
that
superstition
could
suggest
were
used
against
him
he
must
relinquish
his
charge
he
must
refund
the
pension
which
he
had
received
from
the
mistaken
mother
but
danchet
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
conform
to
their
demands
and
refused
to
relinquish
his
charge
they
urged
him
still
more
vehemently
but
met
with
the
same
response
they
at
length
refused
to
pay
him
the
pension
and
withdrew
his
pupils
from
his
care
a
troublesome
followed
but
at
length
the
poet
emerged
triumphant
from
the
troubles
in
which
his
love
of
the
drama
had
involved
him
he
produced
also
the
tragedies
of
tyndarides
and
but
these
did
not
meet
with
the
success
of
his
earlier
work
he
was
a
devoted
son
to
his
mother
depriving
himself
of
even
the
necessaries
of
life
in
order
to
support
her
he
showed
himself
a
kind
and
generous
friend
to
all
and
always
took
a
keen
interest
in
young
men
one
of
these
brought
him
an
elegy
written
to
his
mistress
and
bewailing
her
misfortunes

licentious
romances

him
into

had
previously
been
appointed
by
louis

tutor
to

his
wit
and
grace
made
him
a
great
favourite
at

even
madame

for
a
time
smiled
upon

that
he
did
not
approve

through
the
influence
of

a
bull
was
wrung
from

condemning
the
book
and
declaring
that
propositions
extracted
from
it
were
rash
scandalous
and
offensive
to
pious
ears
pernicious
and
erroneous
the
pope
was
very
reluctant
to
pass
this
sentence
of
condemnation
and
was
induced
to
do
so
through
fear
of
louis
and
not
because
he
considered
the
book
to
be
false
with
his
usual
gentleness
fénélon
accepted
the
sentence
without
a
word
of
protest
he
read

decision
of
his
superiors

to
him

echo
of

hatred
of

did
not

high
favour

inculcated
the
truth
that

is
the
glory
of
princes
and
the
happiness
of
nations
and
while
describing
the
adventures
of
the
son
of

its
author
strove
to
establish
the
true
system

his
work
is
imbued
with
a
sense
of
beauty
and
refinement

renders
it
a
most
pleasurable
book
to
read
but
madame
de
maintenon
was
grievously
offended
by
its
success
and
by
the
praise
which
even
louis
bestowed
upon
it
she
easily
persuaded
him
that
the
work
was
a
carefully
executed
satire
directed
against
the
ministers
of

that
even
the

works

the
telemachus
a
singular
book
which
partakes
at
once
of
the
character
of
a
romance
and
of
a
poem
and
which
substitutes
a
prosaic
cadence
for
versification
but
several
luscious
pictures
would
not
lead
us
to
suspect
that
this
book
issued
from
the
pen
of
a
sacred
minister
for
the
education
of
a
prince
and
what
we
are
told
by
a
famous
poet
is
not
improbable
that
fénélon
did
not
compose
it
at
court
but
that
it
is
the
fruits
of
his
retreat
in
his
diocese
and
indeed
the
amours
of
calypso
and
eucharis
should
not
be
the
first
lessons
that
a
minister
ought
to
give
to
his
scholars
and
besides
the
fine
moral
maxims
which
the
author
attributes
to
the
pagan
divinities
are
not
well
placed
in
their
mouth

the
misfortunes
of

caused

voluminous

might
form
a
special
subject
of
inquiry
and
we
commend
it
to
the
attentions
of
some
other
we
should
hear
the
groans
of
two
eminent
printers
who
were
ruined
by
the
amazing
industry
of
one
author
nicholas
de
lyra
he
himself
died
long
before
printing
was
invented
in
the
year
but
he
left
behind
him
his
great
work
sacra
cum
interpretationibus
et
which
became
the
source
of
trouble
to
the
printers
schweynheym
and
pannartz
of
subiaco
and
rome
they
were
persuaded
or
ordered
by
the
pope
or
his
cardinals
to
print
his
prodigious
commentary
on
the
bible
when
a
few
volumes
had
been
printed
they
desired
most
earnestly
to
be
relieved
of
their
burden
and
petitioned
the
pope
to
be
saved
from
the
bankruptcy
which
this
mighty
undertaking
entailed
they
possessed
a
lasting
memento
of
this
author
in
the
shape
of
eleven
hundred
ponderous
tomes
which
were
destined
to
remain
upon
their
shelves
till
fire
or
moths
or
other
enemies
of
books
had
done
their
work
these
volumes
began
to
be
printed
in
and
contain
the
earliest
specimens
of
greek
type
the
printers
of
the
works
of
prynne
barthius
reynaud
and
other
voluminous
writers
must
have
had
a
sorry
experience
with
their
authors
but
once
bitten
twice
shy
hence
some
of
these
worthies
found
it
rather
difficult
to
publish
their
works
and
there
were
no
agents
or
societies
of
authors
to
aid
their
negotiations
indeed
we
are
told
that
a
printer
who
was
saddled
with
a
large
number
of
unsaleable
copies
of
a
heavy
piece
of
literary
production
adopted
the
novel
expedient
of
bringing
out
several
editions
of
the
work
this
he
accomplished
by
merely
adding
a
new
to
his
old
copies
whereby
he
readily
deceived
the
unwary
catherino
in
his
book
entitled
quotes
the
saying
of
de
fourcey
a
jesuit
of
paris
that
one
might
make
a
pretty
large
volume
of
the
catalogue
of
those
who
have
entirely
ruined
their
booksellers
by
their
books
but
the
booksellers
and
printers
whose
hard
fate
i
wish
principally
to
record
are
those
who
shared
with
the
authors
the
penalties
inflicted
on
account
of
their
condemned
books
unhappily
there
have
been
many
such
whose
fate
has
been
recorded
and
probably
there
are
many
more
who
have
suffered
in
obscurity
the
terrible
punishments
which
the
stern
censors
of
former
days
knew
so
well
how
to
inflict
one
of
the
reputed
discoverers
of
the
art
of
printing
john
fust
is
said
to
have
been
persecuted
he
was
accused
at
paris
of
multiplying
the
scriptures
by
the
aid
of
the
devil

was

the
work
was
given
to
the
printers
in

as
the
english

were
not
very
highly
esteemed
the
book
was
nearly
completed
when
the
inquisition
effectually
stopped
the
further
progress
of
the
work
by
seizing
the
sheets
and

were
forced
to
fly

francis

contrived
to
obtain
their

they
became
printers
themselves

as
a
reward
for
his
labour

we
must
not
omit
the
name
of
another
martyr
amongst
the
honourable
rank
of
printers
of

scriptures
jacob

who
was
beheaded
on

john
lufftius
a
bookseller
and
printer
of
würtemburg
incurred
many
perils
when
he
printed
luther
german
edition
of
the
sacred
scriptures
it
is
said
that
the
pope
used
to
write
lufftius
name
on
paper
once
every
year
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
uttering
terrible
imprecations
and
dire
threatenings
but
the
thunders
of
roman
pontiffs
did
not
trouble
the
worthy
bookseller
who
laughed
at
their
threats
and
exclaimed
i
perspired
so
freely
at
rome
in
the
flame
that
i
must
take
a
larger
draught
as
it
is
necessary
to
extinguish
that
flame
the
same
fatality
befell
robert
stephanus
the
parisian
printer
his
family
name
was
estienne
but
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
he
used
the
latin
form
of
the
word
he
edited
and
published
a
version
of
the
sacred
scriptures
showing
the
hebrew
greek
and
latin
texts
and
adding
certain
notes
which
were
founded
upon
the
writings
of
françois
vatable
abbot
of
bellozane
but
also
contained
some
of
the
scholarly
reflections
of
the
learned
bookseller
on
the
the
name
of
the
abbot
appears
first
before
that
of
stephanus
but
considerable
hostility
was
raised
against
him
by
this
and
other
works
on
the
part
of
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
he
was
compelled
to
seek
safety
in
flight
and
found
a
secure
in
geneva
his
enemies
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
burning
his
effigy
this
troubled
stephanus
quite
as
little
as
the
papal
censures
distressed
lufftius
at
the
time
when
his
effigy
was
being
burnt
the
parisian
printer
was
in
the
snowy
mountains
of
the
auvergne
and
declared
that
he
never
felt
so
cold
in
his
life
the
printers
seem
ever
to
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
protestants
in
germany
they
produced
all
the
works
of
the
reformation
authors
with
great
accuracy
and
skill
and
often
at
their
own
expense
whereas
the
roman
catholics
could
only
get
their
books
printed
at
great
cost
and
even
then
the
printing
was
done
carelessly
and
in
a
slovenly
manner
so
as
to
seem
the
production
of
illiterate
men
and
if
any
printer
more
conscientious
than
the
rest
did
them
more
justice
he
was
jeered
at
in
the
and
at
the
fairs
of
frankfort
for
a
papist
and
a
slave
of
the
priests
this
robert
stephanus
estienne
or
stephens
as
the
name
is
usually
called
was
a
member
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
families
of
learned
printers
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
founder
of
the
family
was
henry
stephens
born
at
paris
in
and
the
last
of
the
race
died
there
in
thus
for
nearly
two
centuries
did
they
confer
the
greatest
advantages
on
literature
which
they
enriched
quite
as
much
by
their
learning
as
by
their
skill
their
biographies
have
frequently
been
written
so
there
is
no
occasion
to
record
them
this
robert
stephens
who
was
exiled
on
account
of
his
books
was
one
of
the
most
illustrious
scholars
of
his
age
he
printed
edited
and
published
an
immense
number
of
works
in
hebrew
greek
and
latin
amongst
others
the
linguae

eusebii
socrates
and
and
many
others
in

of
he
introduced
the
divisions
of
chapter
and
verse
which
are
still
used
with
regard
to
the
accuracy
of
his
proofs
we
are
told
that
he
was
so
careful
as
to
hang
them
up
in
some
place
of
public
resort
and
to
invite
the
corrections
of
the
learned
scholars
who
collected
there
at
geneva
his

to
pour
forth
a
large
number
of

after
his
death
one
of
his
sons
named
charles
carried
on
the
business
another
son
of
robert
stephens
named
henry
was
one
of
those
scholars
who
have
ruined
themselves
by
their
love
of
literature
devoting
their
lives
and
their
fortunes
to
the
production
of
volumes
on
some
special
branch
of
study
in
which
only
a
few
learned
readers
are
interested
hence
while
they
earn
the
gratitude
of
scholars

poor
henry

ten
years
of
labour

nearly
all
his
fortune
this
is
a
very
valuable
work
and
has
proved
of
immense
service
to
subsequent
generations
of
scholars
a
second
edition
was
published
in
london
in
in
seven
folio
volumes
and
recently
another
edition
has
appeared

one
of

works
aroused
the
indignation
of

parisian
authorities
it

entitled

anciennes
avec
les

ou
traité
préparatif

this
work
was
supposed
to
contain
insidious
attacks
upon
the
monks
and
priests
and
roman
catholic
faith
comparing
the
fables
of
herodotus
with
the
teaching
of
catholicism
and
holding
up
the
latter
to

rate
the

other
authorities
attribute

learned
work
which
ruined
his
health
while
it
dissipated
his
fortune
these
are
only
a
few
names
which
might
be
mentioned
out
of
the
many
what
a
noble
army
of
martyrs
literature
could
boast
if
a
were
sounded
amongst
our
booksellers
we
must
not
omit
the
name
of

who
suffered
with
john

in

at

on
account
of
the
latter
work
entitled

barbarous

recorded

cf

sturdy
john
as
the
people
called
john
lilburne
of
commonwealth
fame
was
another
purveyor
of
books
who
suffered
severely
at
the
hands
of
both
royalists
and
roundheads
at
the
early
age
of
eighteen
he
began
the
circulation
of
the
books
of
prynne
and
bastwick
and
for
this
enormity
he
was
whipped
from
the
fleet
to
westminster
set
in
the
pillory
gagged
fined
and
imprisoned
at
a
later
stage
in
his
career
we
find
him
imprisoned
in
the
tower
by
cromwell
for
his
reproof
to
haberdashers
and
fined
and
his
bitter
attack
on
the
protector
entitled
new
chains
caused
him
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
tower
and
to
be
tried
for
high
treason
of
which
he
was
subsequently
acquitted
to
assail
the
powers
that
be
seemed
ever
to
be
the
constant
occupation
of
sturdy
john
lilburne
from
the
above
example
and
from
many
others
which
might
be
mentioned
it
is
quite
evident
that
roundheads
when
they
held
the
power
could
be
quite
as
severe
critics
of
publications
obnoxious
to
them
as
the
royalists
and
troublesome
authors

little
better
under
puritan
regime
than
they
did
under
the
stuart
monarchs
another
learned
french
printer
was
etienne
dolet
who
was
burned
to
death
at
paris
on
account
of
his
books
in
he
lived
and
worked
at
lyons
and
after
the
manner
of
the
stephens
published
many
of
his
own
writings
as
well
as
those
of
other
learned
men
he
applied
his
energies
to
reform
the
latin
style
and
in
addition
to
his
theological
and
linguistical
works
cultivated
the
art
of
poetry
bayle
says
that
his
latin
and
french
verses
are
not
amiss
in
the
opinion
of
gruterus
they
are
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
poetarum
but
the
impassioned
and
scurrilous
scaliger
who
hated
dolet
declares
that
dolet
may
be
called
the
muse
canker
or
imposthume
he
wildly
affects
to
be
absolute
in
poetry
without
the
least
pretence
to
wit

endeavours

which
men
of
learning
rather
judge
to
be
latrations
whilst
he
sung
the
fate
of
that
great
and
good
king
francis
his
name
found
its
own
evil
fate
and
the
atheist
suffered
the
punishment
of
the
flames
which
both
he
and
his
verses
so
richly
merited
but
the
flames
could
not
purify
him
but
were
by
him
rather
made
impure
why
should
i
mention
his
epigrams
which
are
but
a
common
sink
or
shore
of
dull
cold
unmeaning
trash
full
of
that
thoughtless
arrogance
that
braves
the
almighty
and
that
denies
his
being
the
conclusion
of
this
scathing
criticism
is
hardly
meet
for
polite
ears
a
private
wrong
had
made
the
censorious
scaliger
more
bitter
than
usual
in
spite
of
the
protection
of
castellan
a
learned
prelate
dolet
at
length
suffered
in
the
flames
but
whether
the
charge
of
atheism
was
well
grounded
has
never
been
clearly
ascertained
certainly
the
pious
prayer
which
he
uttered
when
the
faggots
were
piled
around
him
would
seem
to
exonerate
him
from
such
a
charge
my
god
whom
i
have
so
often

a

the

damnable
pernicious

which
dolet
rendered

the
additional

were
supposed
to
convict

jehan
morin
reveals
the
fact
that
the
printer
jean
morin
was
imprisoned
on
account
of
this
work
therein
it
is
recorded
that
he
presented
the
copy
to
the
chancellor
with
the
request
that
he
might
be
released
from
prison
where
he
had
been
placed
on
account
of
this
work
the
reasons
given
for
its
condemnation
are
various
some
state
that
the
author
a
friend
of
clement
marot
intended
to
preach
by
the
use
of
allegories
the
reformed
religion
others
say
that
it
was
directed
against
the
manners
and
conduct
of
some
members
of
the
court
whether
morin
request
was
granted
i
know
not
nor
whether
despériers
shared
his
imprisonment
at
any
rate
the
author
died
in
from
an
attack
of
frenzy
another
famous
printer
at
paris
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
christian
wechel
who
published
a
large
number
of
works
he
was
persecuted
for
publishing
a
book
of
erasmus
entitled
esu
interdicto
and
some
declare
that
he
fell
into
grievous
poverty
being
cursed
by
god
for
printing
an
impious
book
thus
one
writer
says
that
in
the
year
arose
this
abortive
child
of
hell
who
wrote
a
book
against
the
divine
justice
in
favour
of
infants
dying
without
baptism
and
several
have
wisely
observed
that
the
ruin
of
christian
wechel
and
his
labours
fell
out
as
a
punishment
for
his
presses
and
characters
being
employed
in
such
an
infamous
work
however
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
book
was
not
so
impious
expressing
only
the
pious
hope
that
the
souls
of
such
infants
might
not
be
lost
and
also
that
no
great
curse
fell
upon
the
printer
and
that
his
poverty
was
apocryphal
at
any
rate
his
son
andrew
was
a
very
flourishing
printer
but
he
too
was
persecuted
for
his
religious
opinions
and
narrowly
escaped
destruction
in
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
he
ran
in
great
danger
on
that
eventful
night
and
states
that
he
would
have
been
slaughtered
but
for
the
kindness
of
hubert
languet
who
lodged
in
his
house
andrew
wechel
fled
to
frankfort
where
he
continued
to
ply
his
trade
in
safety
and
when
more
favourable
times
came
his
presses
at
paris
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
able
printers
and
booksellers
of
his
time
the
revolutionary
period
in
france
was
not
a
safe
time
for
either
authors
or
booksellers
jacques
froullé
was
condemned
to

in
for
publishing
the
lists
of

of

who
passed

on

king
louis
and
doomed
him
to

who

on

of

five
appeals
until
at
length
the
terrible
sentence
was
pronounced
voting
for
the
reprieve
and
for
the
execution
of
their
monarch
the
deputies
were
so
ashamed
of
their
work
that
they
doomed
the
recorder
of
their
infamous
deed
to
share
the
punishment
of
their
sovereign
we
have
few
instances
of
the
illustrators
of
books
sharing
the
misfortunes
of
authors
and
publishers
but
we
have
met
with
one
such
example
nicolas
godonesche
made
the
engravings
for
a
work
by
jean
laurent
boursier
a
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
entitled
abrégée
des
principales
questions
qui
ont
rapport
aux
affaires
and
found
that
work
fatal
to
him
this
book
was
one
of
many
published
by
boursier
concerning
the
unhappy
contentions
which
for
a
long
time
agitated
the
church
of
france
godonesche
who
engraved
pictures
for
the
work
was
sent
to
the
bastille
and
the
author
banished
in
all
ages
complaints
are
heard
of
the
prolific
writers
who
have
been
seized
by
the
scribbling
demon
and
made
to
pour
forth
page
after
page
which
the
public
decline
to
read
and
bring
grief
to
the
publishers
pasquier
contains
the
following
passage
which
applies
perhaps
quite
as
forcibly
to
the
present
age
as
to
his
own
time
i
can
not
forbear
complaining
at
this
time
of
the
calamity
of
this
age
which
has
produced
such
a
plenty
of
reputed
or
untimely
authors
any
pitiful
scribbler
will
have
his
first
thoughts
to
come
to
light
lest
being
too
long
shut
up
they
should
grow
musty
good
god
how
apposite
are
these
verses

this
has
been
translated
as
follows
the
scribbling
crew
would
make
one
vitals
bleed
they
write
such
trash
no
mortal
will
read
yet
they
will
publish
they
must
have
a
name
so
printers
starve
to
get
their
authors
fame
one
would
be
curious
to
see
the
form
of
agreement
between
such
prolific
authors
and
their
deluded
publishers
and
to
learn
by
what
arts
other
than
magical
the
former
ever
induced
the
latter
to
undertake
the
publication
of
such
fatal
books
the
story
of
the
establishment
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
in
england
is
full
of
interest
and
tells
the
history
of
several
books
which
involved
their
authors
and
publishers
in
many
difficulties
the
censors
of
books
did
not
always
occupy
an
enviable
post

what
antiquary
has
not
been
grateful
to

the

of

he
possessed
that
ardent
love
for
the
records
of
the
past
which
must
inspire
the
heart
and
the
pen
of
every
true
antiquary
that
accurate
learning
and
indefatigable
spirit
of
research
without
which
the
historian
however
zealous
must
inevitably
err
and
that
sturdy
patriotism
which
led
him
to
prefer
the
study
of
the
past
glories
of
his
own
to
those
of
any
other
people
or
land
his
will

as

went

monarch
his
anxieties

his
pension
became

at

no
one
seemed
to
appreciate
his
toil
he
became
melancholy
and
morose
and
the
effect
of
nightly
vigils
and
years
of
toil
began
to
tell
upon
his
constitution
at
length
his
mind
gave
way
ere
yet
the
middle
stage
of
life
was
passed
and
although
many
other
famous
antiquaries
have
followed
his
steps
and
profited
by
his
writings
and
his
example
english
scholars
will
ever
mourn
the
sad
and

anything
more
but
like
many
other
authors
he
broke
his
word
poets
are
especially
liable
to
this
change
of
intention
as
la
fontaine
observes
o
combien
est
inconstant
divers
foible
léger
tenant
mal
sa
parole
juré
même
en
assez
beaux
vers
de

à

qui

ne
fit
la

pour
les
cerveaux
qui
hantent
les
neuf
soeurs
in
these
days
of
omnivorous
readers
the
position
of
authors
has
decidedly
improved
we
no
longer
see
the
poets
bartering
their
sonnets
for
a
meal
learned
scholars
pining
in
newgate
nor
is
half
the
pay
of
a
scavenger
footnote
a
remark
of
granger
vide
of
p
considered
sufficient
remuneration
for
recondite
treatises
it
has
been
the
fashion
of
authors
of
all
ages
to
complain
bitterly
of
their
own
times
bayle
calls
it
an
epidemical
disease
in
the
republic
of
letters
and
poets
seem
especially
liable
to
this
complaint
usually
those
who
are
most
favoured
by
fortune
bewail
their
fate
with
vehemence
while
poor
and
unfortunate
authors
write
cheerfully
to
judge
from
his
writings
one
would
imagine
that
balzac
pined
in
poverty
whereas
he
was
living
in
the
greatest
luxury
surrounded
by
friends
who
enjoyed
his
hospitality
oftentimes
this
language
of
complaint
is
a
sign
of
the
ingratitude
of
authors
towards
their
age
rather
than
a
testimony
of
the
ingratitude
of
the
age
towards
authors
thus
did
the
french
poet
pays
abuse
his
fate
i
was
born
under
a
certain
star
whose
malignity
can
not
be
overcome
and
i
am
so
persuaded
of
the
power
of
this
malevolent
star
that
i
accuse
it
of
all
misfortunes
and
i
never
lay
the
fault
upon
anybody
he
has
courted
fortune
in
vain
she
will
have
nought
to
do
with
his
addresses
and
it
would
be
just
as
foolish
to
afflict
oneself
because
of
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
or
moon
as
to
be
grieved
on
account
of
the
changes
which
fortune
is
pleased
to
cause
many
other
writers
speak
in
the
same
fretful
strain
there
is
now
work
in
the
vast
field
of
literature
for
all
who
have
the
taste
ability
and
requisite
knowledge
and
few
authors
now
find
their
books
fatal
to
them
except
perhaps
to
their
reputation
when
they
deserve
the
critics
censures
the
writers
of
novels
certainly
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
unkindness
of
the
public
and
their
lack
of
appreciation
and
the
vast
numbers
of
novels
which
are
produced
every
year
would
have
certainly
astonished
the
readers
of
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
for
the
production
of
learned
works
which
appeal
only
to
a
few
scholars
modern
authors
have
the
aid
of
the
clarendon
press
and
other
institutions
which
are
subsidised
by
the
universities
for
the
purpose
of
publishing
such
works
but
in
spite
of
all
the
advantages
which
modern
authors
enjoy
the
great
demand
for
literature
of
all
kinds
the
justice
and
fair
dealing
of
publishers
the
adequate
remuneration
which
is
usually
received
for
their
works
the
favourable
laws
of
copyright
in
spite
of
all
these
and
other
advantages
the
lamentable
woes
of
authors
have
not
yet
ceased
the
leaders
of
literature
can
hold
their
own
and
prosper
well
but
the
men
who
stand
in
the
second
third
or
fourth
rank
in
the
great
literary
army
have
still
cause
to
bewail
the
unkindness
of
the
blind
goddess
who
contrives
to
see
sufficiently
to
avoid
all
their
approaches
to
her
for
these
brave
but
often
disheartened
toilers
that
noble
institution
the
royal
literary
fund
has
accomplished
great
things
during
a
period
of
more
than
a
century
it
has
carried
on
its
beneficent
work
relieving
poor
struggling
authors
when
poverty
and
sickness
have
laid
them
low
and
it
has
proved
itself
to
be
a
nursing
mother
to
the
wives
and
children
of
literary
martyrs
who
have
been
quite
unable
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
their
distressed
families
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
foundation
of
the
royal
literary
fund
which
arose
from
the
feelings
of
pity
and
regret
excited
by
the
death
of
floyer
sydenham
in
a
prison
it
is
unnecessary
to
record
its
history
its
noble
career
of
unobtrusive
usefulness
in
saving
from
ruin
and
ministering
consolation
to
those
unhappy
authors
who
have
been
wounded
in
the
world
warfare
and
who
but
for
the
literary
fund
would
have
been
left
to
perish
on
the
hard
battlefield
of
life
since
its
foundation
has
been
spent
in
grants
to
distressed
authors
all
will
we
doubt
not
seek
to
help
forward
this
noble
work
and
will
endeavour
to
prevent
as
far
as
possible
any
more
distressing
cases
of
literary
martyrdom
which
have
so
often
stained
the
sad
pages
of
our
literary
history
in
order
to
diminish
the
woes
of
authors
and
to
help
the
maimed
and
wounded
warriors
in
the
service
of
literature
we
should
like
to
rear
a
large
literary
college
where
those
who
have
borne
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
may
rest
secure
from
all
anxieties
and
worldly
worries
when
the
evening
shadows
of
life
fall
around
possibly
the
authorities
of
the
royal
literary
fund
might
be
able
to
accomplish
this
grand
enterprise
in
imagination
we
seem
to
see
a
noble
building
like
an
oxford
college
or
the
charterhouse
wherein
the
veterans
of
literature
can
live
and
work
and
end
their
days
free
from
the
perplexities
and
difficulties
to
which
poverty
and
distress
have
so
long
accustomed
them
there
is
a
library
rich
with
the
choicest
works
the
historian
the
poet
the
divine
the
scientist
can
here
pursue
their
studies
and
breathe
forth
inspired
thoughts
which
the
angusta
have
so
long
stifled
in
society
congenial
to
their
tastes
far
from
the
madding
crowd
ignoble
strife
they
may
succeed
in
accomplishing
their
life
work
and
their
happiness
would
be
the
happiness
of
the
community
if
this
be
but
a
dream
it
is
a
pleasant
one
but
if
all
would
unite
for
the
purpose
of
founding
such
a
literary
college
it
might
be
possible
for
the
dream
to
be
realised
then
the
woes
of
future
generations
of
authors
might
be
effectually
diminished
and
fatal
books
have
less
