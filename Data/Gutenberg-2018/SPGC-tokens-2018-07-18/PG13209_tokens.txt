crash
bang
bang
march
of
the
came
to
an
abrupt
end
john
lansing
birch
laid
down
his
viola
and
bow
whirled
about
and
flung
out
his
arms
in
despair
oh
this
crowd
is
hopeless
he
groaned
never
mind
any
other
instrument
providing
is
heard
this
march
is
supposed
to
die
away
in
the
distance
you
murder
it
in
front
of
the
house
that
second
violin
here
his
wrath
centered
upon
the
young
player
the
second
violin
returned
his
gaze
with
resentment
what
the
use
of
my
playing
like
a
midsummer
zephyr
when
just
sawing
away
like
mad
on
the
bass
she
retorted
the
first
violin
smiled
pleasantly
on
the
little
group
let
try
it
again
she
suggested
and
see
if
we
can
please
john
lansing
better
you
all
right
said
lansing
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
at
celia
if
the
rest
of
the
strings
would
fight
to
drown
you
out
charlotte
plays
as
if
second
violin
were
a
solo
part
with
the
rest
as
accompaniment
charlotte
tucked
her
instrument
under
a
sulky
round
chin
raised
her
bow
and
waited
her
eyes
on
the
floor
celia
smiling
softly
tried
her
strings
that
it
precisely
began
the
leader
still
with
irritation
celia
tunes
between
practice
charlotte
takes
it
for
granted
she
all
right
and
fires
ahead
your
e
string
is
off
the
second
violin
grudgingly
tightened
the
e
string
then
all
her
strings
in
turn
lengthening
the
process
as
much
as
possible
the
did
the
same
the
always
stood
by
the
second
violin
jeff
gave
charlotte
a
glance
of
loyalty
his
g
string
had
been
flatter
than
her
lansing
wheeled
about
and
picked
up
his
instrument
carefully
trying
its
pitch
he
gave
the
signal
and
the
of
the
began
in
the
remote
distance
the
viol
gripped
his
bow
with
his
stubby
fingers
and
hardly
breathed
as
he
strove
to
keep
his
notes
subdued
the
murmured
a
gentle
undertone
the
first
violin
sang
as
sweetly
and
delicately
as
a
bird
her
perfect
the
second
violin
fingered
her
notes
through
but
the
voice
of
her
instrument
was
not
heard
at
all
the
leader
glanced
at
her
once
with
a
frown
between
his
fine
eyebrows
but
charlotte
played
dumbly
on
the
pilgrims
approached
drew
near
passed
marched
away
were
almost
lost
in
the
distance
uplifted
bows
and
silence
good
said
a
hearty
voice
behind
them
everybody
looked
up
smiling
even
the
second
violin
his
children
always
smiled
when
roderick
birch
came
in
it
would
have
been
a
sour
temper
which
could
have
resisted
his
genial
greeting
mother
would
like
the
next
he
said
she
rather
tired
and
after
the
i
want
a
little
talk
with
you
all
something
in
his
voice
or
his
eyes
made
his
elder
daughter
take
notice
of
him
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
play
your
best
she
warned
the
others
in
a
whisper
but
they
needed
no
warning
everybody
always
played
his
best
for
father
and
if
mother
was
tired
the
notes
of
the
second
violin
fell
daintily
caressing
those
which
wrought
out
the
melody
enveloping
but
never
overwhelming
them
as
the
music
ceased
the
leader
turning
to
the
second
violin
met
her
reluctant
eyes
with
a
softening
in
his
own
keen
ones
the
hint
of
a
laugh
curved
the
corners
of
her
lips
as
his
smiled
broadly
it
was
all
the
truce
necessary
charlotte
sulks
never
lasted
longer
than
impatience
they
laid
aside
their
instruments
and
gathered
round
their
father
graceful
celia
sat
down
beside
him
charlotte
curly
black
hair
mingled
with
his
heavy
locks
as
she
perched
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
her
scarlet
flannel
arm
under
his
head
the
youngest
boy
justin
threw
himself
flat
on
the
chin
propped
on
elbow
watching
the
fire
jeff
helped
himself
to
a
low
stool
clasping
long
arms
about
long
legs
as
his
knees
approached
his
head
in
this
posture
and
the
eldest
son
pausing
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
to
face
the
group
now
for
it
he
said
it
looks
serious
a
consultation
of
the
whole
may
we
have
mother
to
back
us
i
sent
mother
to
bed
birch
explained
she
wanted
to
come
down
to
hear
you
play
but
i
would
let
her
and
indeed
there
are
moments
he
glanced
quizzically
at
his
eldest
son
yes
sir
lansing
responded
promptly
there
are
moments
when
the
furnace
pipes
convey
as
much
din
as
she
can
bear
birch
sat
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
for
a
minute
or
two
he
began
at
last
gently
celia
has
mother
seemed
quite
strong
to
you
of
late
mother
strong
asked
celia
in
surprise
why
father
is
she
she
had
that
illness
last
winter
and
was
a
long
time
getting
about
but
she
has
seemed
well
all
summer
their
eyes
were
all
upon
his
face
even
young
justin
had
swung
about
upon
his
elbows
and
was
regarding
his
father
with
attention
they
waited
startled
i
took
her
to
doctor
forester
and
he
surprised
me
a
good
deal
he
seemed
to
think
that
mother
must
not
spend
the
coming
winter
in
this
climate
do
be
alarmed
i
do
want
to
frighten
you
but
i
want
you
to
appreciate
the
necessity
he
thinks
that
if
mother
were
to
have
a
year
of
rest
and
change
we
need
have
no
fears
for
her
fears
repeated
lansing
under
his
breath
was
it
possible
that
anything
was
the
matter
with
mother
why
she
was
the
central
sun
about
which
their
little
family
world
moved
there
could
not
must
not
be
anything
wrong
with
mother
tell
us
plainly
father
urged
celia
soft
voice
she
was
pale
but
she
spoke
quietly
charlotte
at
the
first
word
of
alarm
had
turned
her
face
away
bright
black
eyes
he
was
charlotte
counterpart
in
colouring
and
looks
rested
anxiously
on
the
second
violin
curly
mop
of
hair
tied
at
the
neck
with
a
big
black
bow
of
ribbon
it
was
always
most
expressive
to
jeff
that
bow
of
ribbon
lansing
repeated
celia
words
yes
tell
us
plainly
sir
we
rather
know
i
am
alarming
you
birch
said
quickly
i
knew
i
could
not
say
the
slightest
thing
about
her
without
doing
that
but
i
need
to
talk
it
over
with
you
all
because
if
we
carry
out
the
doctor
prescription
it
means
much
sacrifice
for
every
one
i
had
no
doubt
that
you
would
make
it
but
i
think
it
is
better
for
you
to
understand
its
importance
doctor
forester
says
new
mexico
is
an
almost
certain
cure
for
such
trouble
as
mother
if
taken
early
and
we
are
taking
it
early
justin
and
jeff
looked
puzzled
but
celia
caught
her
breath
and
lansing
ruddy
colour
suddenly
faded
charlotte
buried
her
head
in
her
father
shoulder
and
drew
the
scarlet
flannel
arm
tighter
about
his
neck
the
head
bent
over
the
curly
black
one
for
a
moment
as
if
the
strong
man
of
the
household
found
it
hard
to
face
the
anxious
eyes
which
searched
his
and
would
have
liked
like
his
daughter
to
run
to
cover
but
in
an
instant
he
looked
up
again
and
spoke
in
the
cheery
tone
they
knew
so
well
now
listen
and
be
brave
he
said
mother
trouble
is
like
a
house
just
set
on
fire
a
dash
of
water
and
a
blanket
and
it
is
out
wait
till
a
whole
room
is
ablaze
and
it
a
serious
matter
to
stop
it
now
in
our
case
we
only
the
little
kindling
corner
to
smother
and
the
new
mexico
air
is
water
and
blanket
a
whole
fire
department
if
need
be
the
doctor
assures
me
that
with
mother
good
constitution
and
the
absence
of
any
hereditary
predisposition
to
this
sort
of
thing
only
to
give
her
the
ten
or
twelve
months
of
rest
and
reÃ«nforcement
the
winter
in
new
mexico
the
summer
in
colorado
to
nip
the
whole
thing
in
the
bud
i
believe
him
and
you
must
believe
him
and
me
more
than
all
you
must
not
show
the
slightest
change
of
front
to
her
she
knows
it
all
but
she
does
want
you
to
know
i
think
differently
about
that
three
of
you
are
men
and
women
now
and
the
other
two
he
smiled
into
the
upturned
eager
faces
of
jeff
and
justin
are
getting
to
be
men
even
my
youngest
can
be
depended
upon
to
act
the
strong
part
justin
scrambled
to
his
feet
at
that
and
gravely
laid
a
muscular
hand
in
his
father
i
stand
by
you
sir
he
said
nobody
laughed
charlotte
black
bow
twitched
and
a
queer
sound
burst
from
the
shoulder
where
her
head
was
buried
jeff
thick
black
lashes
went
down
for
a
moment
celia
shook
two
bright
drops
from
brimming
eyes
and
patted
just
sturdy
shoulder
birch
shook
the
hand
vigorously
without
speaking
and
only
lansing
found
words
to
express
what
they
felt
he
speaks
for
us
all
i
know
sir
and
now
if
you
tell
us
our
part
we
take
hold
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
trips
to
new
mexico
from
new
york
are
expensive
they
are
very
expensive
birch
replied
slowly
i
must
go
with
her
we
must
travel
in
the
least
fatiguing
fashion
which
means
on
trains
and
many
extras
by
the
way
she
has
kept
up
bravely
but
this
unusual
exhaustion
after
one
day
in
town
shows
me
how
careful
i
must
be
of
her
on
the
long
journey
then
once
away
no
expense
must
be
spared
to
make
the
absence
tell
for
all
there
is
in
it
and
most
of
all
to
be
considered
while
i
am
away
there
will
be
no
income
they
looked
at
each
other
now
celia
at
lansing
and
lansing
at
jeff
and
jeff
at
both
of
them
charlotte
sat
up
suddenly
her
cheeks
and
eyes
burning
and
stared
hard
at
each
in
turn
the
income
would
stop
and
what
would
that
mean
the
family
had
within
three
years
suffered
heavy
financial
losses
from
causes
outside
of
their
control
and
the
father
income
that
of
in
a
large
suburban
town
had
since
become
the
only
source
of
support
so
far
it
had
sufficed
although
charlotte
and
celia
had
been
sent
away
to
school
and
both
celia
and
lansing
were
now
in
college
it
was
the
remembrance
of
these
heavy
demands
upon
the
family
purse
which
now
caused
the
young
people
to
look
at
one
another
with
startled
questioning
lansing
was
about
to
begin
his
senior
year
at
a
great
university
celia
had
finished
her
first
year
at
a
famous
college
within
a
fortnight
both
were
expecting
to
begin
work
charlotte
did
not
care
about
a
college
course
but
she
had
planned
for
two
years
to
go
to
a
school
of
design
for
she
was
a
promising
young
worker
in
things
decorative
as
for
jefferson
sixteen
years
old
captain
of
the
football
team
six
feet
tall
and
able
to
give
his
brother
lansing
a
hard
battle
for
physical
supremacy
his
dearest
dream
was
a
great
military
school
even
justin
but
justin
was
only
twelve
his
dreams
could
wait
his
was
the
only
face
in
the
group
which
remained
placid
during
the
moments
succeeding
birch
mention
of
the
astonishing
fact
about
the
income
the
father
observant
eyes
noted
all
that
his
children
looks
could
tell
him
of
surprise
disappointment
and
bewilderment
and
of
the
succeeding
effort
they
made
to
rally
their
forces
and
show
no
sign
of
dismay
lansing
made
the
first
effort
i
can
drop
back
a
year
he
said
thoughtfully
or
i
no
merely
working
my
way
through
this
year
would
do
it
would
help
out
at
home
why
lanse
began
celia
and
stopped
he
glanced
meaningly
at
her
and
the
colour
flashed
back
into
her
cheeks
in
the
next
instant
she
had
followed
his
lead
if
lanse
can
stay
out
of
college
i
can
too
she
said
with
decision
if
i
could
get
some
fairly
good
position
lanse
proposed
i
ought
to
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
well
we
rather
a
large
family
and
our
appetites
i
could
do
something
began
charlotte
eagerly
i
could
i
could
do
sewing
at
that
there
was
a
general
howl
which
quite
broke
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
charlotte
sewing
they
cried
why
not
take
in
washing
urged
lanse
or
solicit
orders
for
fancy
cooking
or
tutor
stupid
little
boys
in
languages
come
fiddle
stick
to
your
specialty
charlotte
face
was
a
study
as
she
received
these
hints
they
represented
the
things
she
disliked
most
and
could
do
least
well
yet
they
were
hardly
farther
afield
than
her
own
suggestion
of
sewing
charlotte
inability
with
the
needle
was
proverbial
what
position
do
you
consider
yourself
eminently
fitted
for
lansing
birch
she
inquired
with
uplifted
chin
you
have
me
there
her
brother
returned
only
one
thing
i
can
think
of
to
go
into
the
locomotive
shops
mechanics
wages
are
better
than
most
and
a
little
practical
experience
would
hurt
me
it
was
his
turn
to
be
met
with
derision
it
could
hardly
be
wondered
at
for
as
he
stood
before
them
john
lansing
looked
the
personification
of
fastidiousness
and
his
face
although
it
surmounted
a
strongly
proportioned
and
well
developed
body
suggested
the
mental
characteristics
not
only
of
his
father
but
of
certain
and
uncles
who
had
won
their
distinction
in
intellectual
arenas
even
his
father
seemed
a
little
daunted
at
this
proposal
that
it
laugh
urged
lanse
if
i
proposed
to
try
to
get
on
the
staff
of
a
city
newspaper
you
all
smile
approval
as
at
a
thing
suited
to
my
genius
i
have
to
live
in
town
to
do
that
and
what
little
i
earned
would
go
to
fill
my
own
hungry
mouth
now
at
the
shops
you
need
look
so
dozens
of
fellows
who
are
taking
engineering
courses
put
on
the
overalls
shoulder
a
and
go
to
work
every
morning
during
vacation
at
seven
they
come
grinning
home
at
night
their
faces
black
as
tar
their
spirits
up
in
q
jump
into
a
put
on
clean
togs
and
come
down
to
dinner
looking
like
gentlemen
but
gentlemen
any
more
thoroughly
than
they
have
been
all
day
jeff
looked
at
his
brother
seriously
lanse
he
said
if
you
go
into
one
of
the
locomotive
shops
wo
you
get
a
place
for
me
but
celia
interposed
whatever
the
rest
of
us
do
she
said
jeff
and
just
must
keep
on
with
school
jeff
rebelled
with
a
grimace
not
much
he
shouted
i
guess
one
is
as
good
as
another
in
a
you
do
catch
me
swallowing
algebra
and
german
when
i
might
be
developing
muscle
if
lanse
puts
on
overalls
i
after
him
celia
looked
at
her
father
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
sir
she
asked
if
i
stay
at
home
dismiss
delia
and
do
the
housework
myself
and
lanse
finds
some
suitable
position
ca
we
get
on
charlotte
can
put
off
the
school
of
design
another
year
we
will
all
be
very
economical
about
clothes
being
economical
does
bring
in
cash
to
pay
bills
interrupted
jeff
do
the
best
he
can
lanse
wo
draw
any
salary
the
first
year
he
could
probably
get
clerical
work
at
one
of
the
banks
but
what
that
he
fall
off
so
in
his
wind
i
could
throw
him
across
the
room
in
three
months
they
all
laughed
jeff
devotion
to
athletics
dominated
his
ideals
at
all
times
and
his
disgust
at
the
thought
of
such
a
depletion
of
his
brother
physical
forces
was
amusing
celia
was
still
looking
at
her
father
he
spoke
in
the
hearty
tone
to
which
they
were
accustomed
his
face
full
of
satisfaction
you
please
me
very
much
all
of
you
he
said
it
will
be
the
best
tonic
i
can
offer
your
mother
her
greatest
trial
is
this
very
necessity
which
she
foresaw
the
instant
the
plan
was
formed
so
much
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
her
children
yet
she
agreed
with
me
that
the
experience
might
not
be
wholly
bad
for
you
and
she
said
he
paused
smiling
at
his
elder
daughter
that
with
celia
at
the
helm
she
was
sure
the
family
ship
would
be
wrecked
then
he
told
them
that
they
might
plan
the
division
of
labour
and
responsibility
as
they
thought
practicable
he
agreed
with
celia
that
the
younger
boys
must
remain
in
school
but
added
since
at
this
point
it
became
necessary
to
mollify
his
son
jefferson
that
a
fellow
with
a
will
might
find
any
number
of
remunerative
odd
jobs
out
of
school
and
study
hours
he
commended
lansing
idea
but
advised
him
to
look
around
before
deciding
and
he
passed
an
affectionate
hand
over
black
curls
as
he
observed
that
young
person
sunk
in
gloom
cheer
up
little
girl
he
said
the
second
violin
is
immensely
important
to
the
music
of
the
family
orchestra
the
hand
that
can
design
can
learn
to
relieve
the
mistress
of
the
house
of
some
of
her
cares
celia
without
a
maid
in
the
kitchen
will
find
plenty
of
use
for
such
a
quick
brain
as
lies
under
this
thatch
but
at
this
moment
something
happened
something
to
which
the
family
were
not
unused
charlotte
suddenly
wriggled
out
from
under
the
caressing
hand
and
in
half
a
dozen
quick
movements
was
out
of
the
room
they
had
all
had
a
vision
of
brilliant
wet
eyes
flushing
cheeks
and
red
rebellious
mouth
poor
child
murmured
celia
she
thinks
we
find
her
of
no
use
she
is
rather
a
scatterbrain
lanse
observed
the
year
may
do
her
good
as
you
say
father
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
he
added
with
modesty
there
a
lot
of
things
she
can
do
just
the
same
jeff
fired
up
instantly
things
the
rest
of
us
are
perfect
noodles
at
when
she
gets
to
earning
more
money
in
a
day
than
the
rest
of
us
can
in
a
month
maybe
we
let
up
on
that
business
good
for
you
you
faithful
achates
said
lanse
then
he
turned
to
his
father
you
have
told
us
yet
when
you
go
sir
if
we
can
two
weeks
from
said
birch
then
he
went
to
tell
his
wife
that
she
might
go
peacefully
to
sleep
for
her
children
were
ready
to
become
her
devoted
slaves
justin
followed
jeff
out
of
the
room
and
jeff
broke
away
from
this
younger
brother
and
hastened
to
rap
a
familiar
comforting
signal
of
comradeship
on
charlotte
locked
door
left
alone
lanse
and
celia
looked
at
each
other
well
old
girl
began
lansing
gently
o
lanse
breathed
celia
he
patted
her
shoulder
bear
up
dear
it
tough
to
give
up
college
for
a
year
oh
not
it
cried
the
girl
and
buried
her
face
in
a
sofa
pillow
no
that
not
it
he
answered
under
his
breath
he
shook
his
shoulders
and
walked
away
to
the
fire
stood
staring
down
into
it
for
a
minute
with
sober
eyes
then
drew
a
long
breath
and
came
back
to
his
sister
it
a
relief
that
there
something
we
can
do
to
help
her
get
well
he
said
slowly
and
she
will
get
well
celia
she
will
chapter
ii
where
the
charlotte
wait
just
a
moment
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
dressing
sack
and
knit
slippers

in
the
case

them

in
and
i
do
justin

please
and

that
unopened
package
of
you

it
on
the
pantry
shelf
i
think
lanse
if
the
furnace
runs
all
night
with
the
draught
on
your
fire
will
be
burned
out
in
the
morning
and
it
will
take
an
extra
amount
of
coal
to
get
it
started
again
where
jeff
he
must
be
told
about
put
mother
overshoes
to
warm
i
have
left
two
hundred
dollars
to
your
credit
at
the
bank
lansing
and
i
lanse
did
you
telephone
for
where
did
celia
put
the
listen
all
of
you
i
what
did
jeff
do
with
that
small
white
shouted
lansing
above
the
din
ca
you
people
get
these
traps
together
without
all
yelling
at
once
you
will
have
mother
so
used
up
she
ca
start
birch
smiled
at
her
tall
son
from
the
easy
chair
where
she
had
been
placed
ten
minutes
before
her
family
protesting
that
they
could
finish
the
numberless
small
tasks
yet
to
be
done
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
and
it
lacked
but
an
hour
of
they
all
looked
at
the
slender
figure
in
the
easy
chair
they
had
learned
in
these
last
two
weeks
to
take
note
of
their
appearance
as
with
easy
confidence
in
her
exhaustless
strength
they
had
never
done
before
since
the
night
when
they
had
learned
that
she
was
not
quite
well
they
had
discovered
for
themselves
the
delicacy
of
the
smiling
face
the
thinness
of
the
graceful
body
the
many
small
signs
by
which
those
who
run
may
read
the
evidences
of
lessened
vitality
if
their
eyes
are
once
opened
they
wondered
that
they
had
not
seen
it
all
before
and
found
the
only
explanation
in
the
cheery
undaunted
spirit
which
had
covered
up
every
sign
of
fatigue
she
is
too
tired
already
declared
celia
run
away
and
let
father
and
me
finish
but
they
would
not
go
how
could
they
with
only
an
hour
left
they
subdued
their
voices
and
ran
whispering
about
jeff
held
a
long
conference
in
an
undertone
with
his
mother
justin
perched
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
his
head
on
her
shoulder
and
she
would
not
have
him
taken
away
her
own
heart
sick
within
her
at
thought
of
the
long
absence
from
them
all
altogether
when
one
took
into
account
the
preceding
fortnight
of
making
ready
for
the
trip
it
was
not
strange
that
in
this
last
hour
of
preparation
she
gave
out
entirely
the
first
they
knew
of
it
was
when
birch
with
a
low
exclamation
sprang
across
the
room
and
catching
up
his
wife
in
his
arms
carried
her
to
a
couch
water
he
said
and
open
the
window
startled
they
obeyed
him
it
was
only
a
brief
unconsciousness
and
the
lovely
brown
eyes
when
they
unclosed
were
as
full
of
bravery
as
ever
but
birch
spoke
anxiously
to
lansing
in
the
hall
outside
i
do
like
to
start
with
her
as
as
this
he
said
yet
everything
is
engaged
the
and
all
and
i
do
want
to
delay
without
reason
there
not
time
to
send
to
the
city
for
doctor
forester
suppose
you
telephone
doctor
ridgway
to
come
around
and
tell
us
what
to
do
about
starting
if
he
is
out
try
sears
or
barton
have
him
hurry
we
barely
minutes
now
in
three
minutes
lansing
came
back
and
beckoned
his
father
out
of
the
room
they
all
out
he
said
i
tried
old
doctor
hitchcock
too
but
sick
in
bed
how
about
that
new
doctor
that
just
moved
in
next
door
i
like
his
looks
he
certainly
will
know
enough
to
advise
about
this
birch
hesitated
a
moment
well
call
him
he
decided
lansing
was
already
down
the
stairs
three
minutes
later
he
returned
with
the
young
doctor
birch
met
them
in
the
hall
doctor
churchill
father
birch
looked
keenly
into
a
pair
of
eyes
whose
steady
glance
gave
him
instantly
the
feeling
that
here
was
a
man
to
trust
the
young
people
waited
impatiently
outside
while
doctor
churchill
spent
fifteen
quiet
minutes
with
their
father
and
mother
when
birch
came
to
the
door
again
with
the
physician
he
was
looking
relieved
doctor
churchill
paused
before
the
little
group
his
eyes
glancing
kindly
at
each
in
turn
as
he
spoke
to
lansing
he
certainly
was
young
but
there
was
about
him
an
air
of
quiet
confidence
and
decision
which
one
felt
instinctively
would
be
justified
by
further
acquaintance
do
be
anxious
he
said
all
this
hurry
of
preparation
has
been
a
severe
test
on
her
taken
with
her
reluctance
to
leave
her
home
she
is
feeling
stronger
now
and
it
will
be
better
for
her
to
get
the
over
than
to
postpone
and
dread
it
longer
you
will
all
make
it
easy
for
her
no
breakdowns
he
cautioned
with
a
smile
new
mexico
is
a
great
place
and
you
are
doing
the
best
thing
in
the
world
in
getting
her
off
before
cold
weather
he
was
gone
but
they
felt
as
if
a
reviving
breeze
had
passed
over
them
and
when
they
went
back
to
their
mother
room
it
was
with
serene
faces
if
charlotte
swallowed
hard
at
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
celia
lingered
an
instant
behind
the
rest
to
pinch
the
colour
back
into
her
cheeks
nobody
observed
it
perhaps
each
was
too
occupied
with
acting
his
own
part
somehow
the
minutes
slipped
away
and
soon
the
travellers
were
at
the
door
into
birch
face
also
the
colour
had
returned
summoned
there
it
may
be
not
only
by
the
doctor
stimulating
draught
but
by
the
insistence
of
her
own
will
god
be
with
you
all
murmured
birch
breaking
with
difficulty
away
from
justin
frantic
hug
birch
on
lansing
arm
had
gone
down
the
steps
to
the
carriage
the
father
followed
surrounded
by
an
eager
group
only
lansing
was
to
go
to
the
train
the
others
as
they
crowded
round
the
carriage
door
were
incoherently
mingling
parting
messages
then
presently
they
were
left
behind
a
suddenly
quiet
sober
group
inside
the
carriage
birch
with
her
hand
in
her
eldest
son
was
saying
to
him
things
he
never
forgot
while
his
father
looked
steadily
out
of
the
window
i
leave
them
in
your
care
dear
she
told
lansing
in
the
quiet
confident
tones
to
which
he
was
used
from
her
i
could
never
go
i
think
if
i
had
such
a
strong
brave
trustworthy
son
to
leave
in
care
of
the
younger
ones
celia
will
do
her
part
and
do
it
beautifully
i
know
but
it
on
you
i
rely
i
do
my
best
he
answered
cheerfully
although
he
felt
even
more
than
before
the
heavy
responsibility
upon
him
i
know
you
will
do
let
celia
overdo
she
will
be
so
ambitious
to
run
the
household
economically
that
she
will
set
herself
tasks
she
not
fit
for
see
that
jeff
keeps
steadily
at
his
studies
and
be
lenient
with
justin
he
adores
you
you
can
make
the
year
do
much
for
him
if
you
take
thought
and
with
my
little
charlotte
be
very
patient
lanse
she
will
miss
us
most
and
show
it
least
i
doubt
that
thought
lanse
but
aloud
he
said
we
all
hang
together
mother
you
may
count
on
that
we
have
our
differences
and
our
eccentricities
but
we
a
lot
of
family
spirit
and
no
one
of
us
is
going
to
sacrifice
alone
while
the
rest
fail
to
take
notice
and
you
going
to
know
all
that
goes
on
we
planned
to
take
turns
writing
so
that
at
least
every
other
day
a
letter
will
start
for
new
mexico
and
if
anything
should
go
wrong
nothing
will
asserted
lansing
that
you
do
know
dear
said
the
gentle
voice
not
quite
so
steadily
as
before
if
anything
should
come
we
must
know
i
remember
he
promised
reluctantly
his
hand
under
pressure
from
hers
but
inwardly
he
vowed
anything
short
of
real
trouble
you
not
know
little
mother
your
children
are
stronger
than
you
now
and
they
can
bear
some
things
for
you
at
the
train
it
took
all
lansing
determination
sturdy
fellow
though
he
was
to
keep
up
his
cheerful
front
the
colour
had
ebbed
away
from
birch
face
once
more
and
as
she
put
up
her
arms
to
her
tall
son
in
the
little
she
seemed
to
him
all
at
once
so
small
and
frail
that
he
could
not
endure
to
see
her
go
away
from
them
all
facing
even
the
remote
possibility
that
in
the
new
land
she
might
fail
to
find
again
her
old
vigour
it
had
to
be
done
however
lansing
received
her
clinging
whispered
in
her
ear
something
which
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
any
but
a
mother
intuition
so
choky
was
his
voice
gripped
his
father
hand
with
both
his
own
turned
and
smiled
back
at
the
two
as
he
pulled
open
the
door
and
swung
off
the
train
just
as
it
began
to
move
he
raced
away
over
the
streets
to
take
a
for
home
having
dismissed
the
carriage
and
craving
nothing
so
much
as
a
long
walk
in
the
cool
september
night
at
home
he
found
everybody
gone
to
bed
except
celia
who
met
him
at
the
door
she
smiled
at
him
but
he
could
see
that
she
had
been
crying
although
he
had
carried
home
a
heavy
heart
he
braced
himself
to
begin
his
task
of
keeping
the
family
cheered
up
off
all
right
he
announced
in
a
casual
tone
as
if
he
had
just
sent
away
the
guests
of
a
week
splendid
train
jolly
porter
one
of
the
kind
judge
and
van
camp
were
taking
the
same
train
as
far
as
chicago
that
will
do
a
lot
toward
making
things
pleasant
to
start
with
i
so
glad
celia
agreed
how
did
mother
get
off
did
her
strength
keep
up
pretty
well
better
than
i
have
thought
possible
after
all
the
fuss
of
that
last
hour
the
new
doctor
braced
her
up
in
good
shape
he
seems
all
right
did
you
like
the
way
he
acted
neither
like
an
old
family
physician
nor
a
new
just
quiet
and
cool
and
pleasant
glad
he
lives
next
door
i
mean
to
know
him
lansing
was
turning
out
lights
as
he
talked
looking
after
window
fastenings
and
examining
things
generally
celia
watched
him
from
her
place
on
the
bottom
stair
he
was
approaching
her
with
the
intention
of
putting
out
the
hall
light
and
joining
her
to
proceed
when
he
stopped
still
wheeled
and
made
for
the
back
of
the
hall
where
the
cellar
stairs
began
i
forgetting
the
furnace
he
cried
it
all
right
celia
assured
him
jeff
took
care
of
it
he
says
that
his
work
since
you
to
be
away
all
day
think
he
can
manage
it
of
course
he
can
the
way
to
please
jeff
is
to
give
him
responsibility
he
old
enough
and
even
having
to
look
after
such
small
matters
regularly
will
help
to
develop
him
lansing
laughed
then
extinguishing
the
light
he
came
up
to
her
on
the
stair
and
putting
his
arm
about
her
shoulders
began
to
ascend
slowly
with
her
shouldering
your
cares
already
are
you
got
to
keep
us
all
straight
and
develop
all
our
characters
poor
girl
you
have
a
hard
tussle
i
afraid
i
shall
do
you
go
to
work
at
the
shops
in
the
morning
yes
breakfast
at
six
did
you
tell
delia
yes
but
i
going
to
let
her
go
afterward
i
arranged
with
her
when
father
first
told
us
to
stay
just
till
they
had
gone
and
then
leave
things
to
me
i
ca
be
too
busy
from
now
on
and
i
do
want
to
wait
a
day
to
begin
wise
girl
sorry
though
that
i
have
to
get
you
up
every
morning
so
early
could
you
leave
things
ready
so
i
could
manage
for
myself
about
breakfast
somehow
no
indeed
if
i
to
have
a
for
a
brother
i
shall
see
that
he
has
a
good
hot
breakfast
and
the
heartiest
kind
of
a
lunch
in
his
pail
you
the
right
sort
murmured
lansing
patting
his
sister
shoulder
as
he
paused
with
her
in
front
of
her
door
i
must
admit
i
shall
prefer
the
hot
breakfast
better
sleep
late
morning
though
i
shall
be
up
when
you
are
celia
declared
look
here
little
girl
said
lansing
speaking
soberly
in
the
darkness
you
know
you
have
got
this
household
on
your
shoulders
all
alone
it
a
partnership
affair
and
do
you
forget
it
now
good
night
and
take
care
you
sleep
like
a
top
celia
held
him
tight
for
a
minute
and
answered
bravely
you
a
dear
boy
and
a
great
comfort
lansing
tiptoed
away
to
his
own
room
farther
down
the
hall
feeling
a
strong
sense
of
relief
that
the
determination
of
the
young
substitute
heads
of
the
house
to
begin
the
new
regime
without
a
preliminary
hour
of
wailing
had
been
successfully
carried
through
we
got
the
worst
over
he
thought
as
he
fell
asleep
once
fairly
started
it
wo
be
so
bad
celia
clear
grit
that
sure
alone
in
her
room
celia
had
it
out
with
herself
and
spent
a
wakeful
night
but
she
brought
a
cheerful
face
to
lansing
early
breakfast
and
when
the
younger
members
of
the
family
came
down
later
she
was
ready
for
them
with
the
sunshine
they
had
dreaded
not
to
find
everybody
spent
a
busy
day
jeff
and
justin
went
off
to
school
charlotte
announced
with
meekness
that
she
was
ready
for
whatever
work
celia
might
find
for
her
and
was
given
various
rooms
to
sweep
and
dust
her
sister
being
confident
that
vigorous
manual
labour
would
be
the
best
tonic
for
a
mind
dispirited
as
for
celia
herself
she
dismissed
delia
the
maid
of
all
work
with
a
kindly
farewell
and
the
letters
of
recommendation
her
mother
had
prepared
and
plunged
eagerly
into
business
she
was
a
born
manager
and
loved
many
of
the
details
of
housework
particularly
the
baking
and
brewing
and
she
was
soon
enthusiastically
employed
in
putting
the
small
kitchen
to
rights
at
noon
charlotte
and
the
boys
were
served
with
a
light
luncheon
with
the
promise
of
greater
joys
to
come
and
by
five
in
the
afternoon
the
house
was
filled
with
the
delightful
odours
of
successful
cookery
at
that
hour
charlotte
whose
labours
had
been
enlarged
by
herself
to
cover
a
thorough
overhauling
of
the
entire
house
such
tasks
being
her
special
aversion
and
therefore
to
be
discharged
without
mitigation
on
this
first
day
of
wandered
disconsolately
into
the
kitchen
with
broom
and
looking
sadly
weary
she
gazed
with
envious
eyes
at
her
sister
flying
about
in
a
big
apron
with
sleeves
rolled
up
her
cheeks
like
carnations
her
eyes
bright
with
triumph
well
you
do
start
in
with
vim
the
younger
sister
observed
dropping
into
a
chair
with
a
long
sigh
yes
and
the
work
has
gone
better
than
i
had
hoped
declared
celia
whisking
a
tinful
of
plump
rolls
into
the
oven
it
really
fun
i
glad
you
like
it
poor
child
said
celia
pausing
to
glance
at
the
dejected
figure
in
the
chair
its
dark
curls
a
riot
of
disorder
a
smudge
of
black
upon
its
forehead
and
its
pinafore
disreputable
with
frequent
use
as
a
duster
i
gave
you
too
much
to
do
did
i
hear
you
in
delia
room
you
need
have
touched
that
wanted
to
get
through
with
it
delia
may
be
a
good
cook
but
she
left
a
mess
of
a
closet
please
give
me
one
of
those
warm
cookies
i
so
used
up
and
hungry
i
ca
wait
for
supper
justin
came
in
half
an
hour
ago
so
famished
there
would
have
been
a
cookie
left
if
i
had
filled
him
up
with
a
banana
by
the
way
i
sent
him
down
cellar
after
some
peach
pickles
and
i
have
seen
him
since
i
run
down
and
get
some
i
hot
rolls
and
honey
for
supper
and
lanse
always
wants
peach
pickles
with
that
combination
celia
took
a
bowl
from
the
cupboard
opened
the
cellar
door
and
started
down
turning
on
the
second
step
to
say
go
and
take
a
bath
and
put
on
a
fresh
frock
you
wo
feel
half
so
tired
wear
the
scarlet
waist
will
you
i
want
things
particularly
bright
and
cheery
for
i
know
lanse
will
come
home
fagged
with
the
new
work
laurier
sent
over
some
red
carnations
i
put
them
in
the
middle
of
the
table
they
look
ever
so
pretty
i
going
to
what
she
intended
to
do
celia
never
told
if
she
ever
afterward
remembered
what
she
did
do
was
to
slip
upon
the
third
step
of
the
steep
stairway
and
with
no
outcry
whatever
go
plunging
heavily
to
the
bottom
chapter
iii
celia
celia
are
you
hurt
cried
charlotte
and
dashed
down
the
stairs
there
was
no
answer
with
trembling
hands
she
felt
for
her
head
it
lay
close
against
the
cellar
wall
and
she
instantly
understood
that
celia
must
be
unconscious
but
whether
there
might
be
more
to
be
feared
than
unconsciousness
she
could
not
tell
in
the
dark
her
first
thought
was
to
get
a
light
the
next
that
she
must
have
help
at
once
she
rushed
up
the
stairs
calling
jeff
and
justin
but
neither
boy
was
to
be
found
then
she
ran
to
the
telephone
with
the
idea
of
summoning
one
of
the
suburban
physicians
but
turned
aside
from
this
purpose
with
the
further
realisation
that
first
of
all
celia
must
be
brought
up
from
the
cold
dark
place
in
which
she
lay
and
restored
to
consciousness
she
ran
to
the
front
door
to
summon
the
nearest
neighbour
and
she
remembered
then
with
relief
that
the
nearest
neighbour
was
doctor
churchill
the
young
physician
who
had
been
called
in
to
see
her
mother
the
evening
before
she
flew
across
the
narrow
lawn
between
her
own
house
and
that
where
the
new
doctor
had
set
up
his
office
and
rang
imperatively
the
door
opened
and
doctor
churchill
hat
and
case
in
hand
evidently
on
his
way
to
a
patient
stood
before
her
what
he
thought
of
the
figure
before
him
with
its
riotous
curly
black
hair
brilliant
eyes
pale
dark
cheeks
dusty
pinafore
a
singular
smudge
upon
the
forehead
and
sleeves
rolled
up
to
the
elbows
nobody
would
have
known
from
his
manner
which
instantly
expressed
a
friendly
concern
charlotte
could
only
gasp
oh
come
quick
he
followed
her
stopping
to
ask
no
questions
at
the
open
cellar
door
charlotte
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
down
there
my
sister
she
breathed
bring
a
light
please
said
the
doctor
and
he
disappeared
down
the
stairs
charlotte
lighted
a
little
kitchen
lamp
and
came
after
him
he
bade
her
stand
by
while
he
made
his
first
brief
examination
i
think
the
blow
on
her
head
is
serious
he
said
presently
but
i
ca
tell
where
else
she
may
be
hurt
till
i
get
her
he
was
strong
and
he
lifted
celia
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
carried
her
easily
up
the
steep
stairs
charlotte
led
the
way
to
a
wide
couch
in
the
as
celia
was
laid
gently
upon
it
she
opened
her
eyes
half
an
hour
later
john
lansing
birch
in
his
oldest
clothes
and
wearing
a
rather
disreputable
soft
hat
pulled
down
over
his
forehead
with
his
hands
and
face
excessively
dirty
and
a
on
his
arm
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
something
burning
he
shouted
celia
charlotte
where
are
you
all
great
scott
what
a
smudge
he
strode
across
the
room
and
lifted
from
the
stove
a
kettle
of
potatoes
from
which
the
water
had
boiled
away
some
minutes
before
first
returns
from
the
amateur
cooking
district
he
muttered
glancing
critically
about
the
kitchen
something
else
in
the
way
of
overcooked
viands
seemed
to
assail
his
nostrils
and
he
jerked
open
the
oven
door
a
tin
of
blackened
rolls
puffed
out
at
him
their
pungent
smoke
well
what
he
was
beginning
with
the
natural
irritation
of
the
hungry
man
who
has
been
anticipating
his
supper
all
the
way
home
and
sees
it
in
ruin
before
his
eyes
when
charlotte
appeared
in
the
doorway
o
lanse
she
cried
and
ran
to
him
well
what
is
it
celia
got
a
headache
and
left
you
in
charge
everything
burnt
up
i
can
tell
you
that
celia
is
she
broken
her
knee
she
fell
down
the
cellar
stairs
and
where
is
she
and
hat
went
down
on
the
floor
as
lanse
got
rid
of
them
and
seized
charlotte
arm
up
in
her
room
doctor
churchill
there
he
sent
for
doctor
forester
churchill
forester
repeated
lanse
as
if

old
girl

of
course

her
head
too
she
was
unconscious
at
first
i
was
all

for
the
door
then
hesitated

waiting
for

comfortable
as
he
can
but

our
regular
doctor

he
says
before

does
up
her
knee

do
see
why
i
wanted

it
himself
that
all
right
said
lanse
doctors
always
do
that
kind
of
thing
the
honourable
ones
do
it
better
to
have
doctor
forester

celia
till
i
cleaned
up
a
bit
she
not
used
to
me
like
this
poor
little
girl
poor
little
girl
he
groaned
as
he
made
his
rapid
way
to
the
the
cellar
stairs
they
dark
and
steep
enough
but
how
could
a
girl
like
celia
get
a
fall
like
that
and
father
and
mother
how
are
we
going
to
fix
it
with
them
in
the
midst
of
his
splashing
and
scrubbing
he
heard
jeff
and
justin
come
shouting
in
for
supper
and
charlotte
hushing
them
and
telling
them
the
news
the
next
instant
jeff
was
upon
him
say
but
this
is
awful
lanse
she
was
getting
up
a
rattling
good
dinner
too
been
at
it
all
day
her
one
idea
was
to
please

first
day
at
the
shops

up
to
see
her
charlotte
says
i

up
poor
youngster
says
celia
told
him
to
go
after

pickles
and
he
forgot
it
if
he
gone
she
would
have
got
her
tumble
what
father
and
mother
say
what
are
we
going
to
do
anyhow
second
fiddle
no
good
on
earth
in
the
kitchen
she
could
boil
an
egg
say
breaking
your
no
joke
price
williston
did
it
a
year
ago
august
and
he
has
got
good
use
of
it
yet
he
never
will
oh
let
up
on
that
lanse
cut
him
short
and
do
mention
it
again
to
anybody
doctor
forester
and
churchill
will
fix
her
up
all
right
only
it
an
awful
shame
it
should
have
happened
i
going
up
to
see
doctor
churchill
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
met
that
person
coming
down
shook
hands
with
him
eagerly
and
listened
to
a
brief
and
concise
account
of
his
sister
injury
as
it
ended
doctor
forester
automobile
rolled
up
to
the
door
did
the
five
and
a
half
miles
in
precisely
twenty
minutes
said
doctor
forester
as
he
came
up
the
steps
watch
in
hand
slow
speed
within
limits
and
all
lanse
my
boy
this
is
too
bad
doctor
churchill
very
glad
to
see
you
again
decided
to
settle
out
here
eh
well
on
some
accounts
i
think
you
wise
charlotte
little
girl
cheer
up
there
are
worse
things
than
a
fractured
patella
i
believe
that
what
you
called
the
injury
doctor
churchill
in
such
genial
fashion
the
surgeon
and
old
friend
of
the
family
made
his
entry
bringing
with
him
that
atmosphere
which
men
of
his
profession
carry
about
with
them
making
the
people
who
have
been
anxiously
awaiting
them
feel
that
here
is
somebody
who
knows
how
to
take
things
coolly
and
is
not
upset
at
the
notion
of
a
broken
bone
he
moved
deliberately
toward
celia
room
listening
to
the
younger
physician
statement
of
the
conditions
under
which
he
had
been
called
turning
at
the
door
to
smile
and
nod
back
at
charlotte
who
watched
him
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
with
serious
eyes
at
the
end
of
what
seemed
like
a
long
period
of
time
the
two
physicians
came
together
meeting
lanse
at
the
foot
well
sir
said
doctor
forester
so
far
so
good
celia
is
as
comfortable
as
such
cases
usually
are
an
hour
or
two
afterward
which
is
not
saying
much
from
her
point
of
view
though
a
good
deal
from
ours
she
has
a
long
siege
of
inactivity
before
her
to
put
that
knee
into
a
strong
condition
but
it
will
not
be
a
great
while
before
she
can
be
about
on
crutches
i
hope
doctor
churchill
at
my
insistence
has
put
up
the
knee
in
the
best
possible
shape
and
i
am
going
to
leave
it
in
his
care
i
drop
in
now
and
then
but
the
doctor
is
right
beside
you
and
i
full
confidence
in
him
i
knew
his
father
and
i
know
enough
about
him
to
be
sure
that
you
all
right
in
his
hands
lanse
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
i
very
thankful
it
no
worse
he
said
but
doctor
forester
what
are
we
to
do
about
father
and
mother
we
ca
tell
them
tell
them
no
said
doctor
forester
with
decision
i
would
have
your
mother
told
under
any
consideration
so
long
as
the
girl
does
well
she
would
be
back
here
on
the
next
train
and
then
we
have
something
worse
than
a
broken
patella
on
our
hands
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
you
can
let
your
father
know
i
should
do
that
i
can
i
think
said
lanse
thoughtfully
we
to
send
them
letters
until
they
settled
and
father
will
get
those
at
the
and
read
them
first
as
to
your
other
problems
housekeeping
and
all
that
over
which
celia
is
several
times
more
worried
than
over
her
own
condition
can
you
figure
those
out
yes
somehow
good
go
up
and
tell
her
so
she
thinks
the
house
is
going
to
destruction
without
her
good
chance
for
the
second
violin
too
bad
that
clever
little
orchestra
will
have
to
drop
its
practice
for
a
few
weeks
i
meant
to
run
in
some
evening
soon
and
hear
you
play
well
i
overdue
at
the
hospital
lanse
doctor
churchill
keep
me
posted
concerning
the
knee
then
the
busy
surgeon
who
had
put
off
several
engagements
to
come
out
to
the
suburban
town
and
look
after
the
family
of
his
old
friend
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
since
their
college
days
was
off
in
his
runabout
his
chauffeur
getting
promptly
under
as
much
headway
as
the
law
allows
and
rushing
him
out
of
sight
in
a
hurry
lanse
turned
to
doctor
churchill
who
stood
upon
the
porch
beside
him
hat
and
case
in
hand
i
mighty
thankful
you
were
so
near
he
said
doctor
forester
has
given
you
much
choice
said
the
other
man
smiling
i
did
my
best
to
give
you
the
chance
of
having
some
one
of
the
physicians
you
know
here
in
town
take
charge
of
the
case
but
he
insisted
on
my
keeping
it
i
should
like
however
to
be
sure
that
you
are
satisfied
you
do
know
me
at
all
you
know
the
steady
eyes
were
looking
keenly
at
lanse
and
he
felt
the
sincerity
in
the
words
he
returned
the
scrutiny
without
speaking
for
an
instant
then
he
put
out
his
hand
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
do
he
said
slowly
anyhow
i
going
to
know
you
and
i
glad
of
the
chance
thank
you
doctor
churchill
shook
hands
warmly
and
went
down
the
steps
i
will
come
over
for
a
minute
about
ten
he
added
to
make
sure
that
miss
birch
is
resting
as
quietly
as
we
can
hope
for
lanse
watched
the
erect
figure
cross
the
lawn
and
disappear
in
the
office
door
of
the
old
house
near
by
then
he
turned
well
we
in
a
sweet
scrape
now
that
certain
he
said
gloomily
to
himself
as
he
marched
at
the
top
he
encountered
his
young
brother
justin
that
stood
awaiting
him
his
face
so
disconsolate
that
in
spite
of
himself
lanse
smiled
cheer
up
youngster
he
said
it
pretty
tough
but
as
doctor
forester
says
it
might
be
worse
want
to
go
in
with
me
and
see
sister
a
minute
but
justin
got
hold
of
his
arm
and
held
him
back
lanse
i
got
to
tell
you
something
he
begged
please
come
here
in
your
room
a
minute
lanse
followed
wondering
justin
although
a
healthy
and
happy
boy
enough
was
apt
to
take
things
seriously
and
sometimes
needed
to
be
joked
out
of
singular
notions
in
lanse
room
justin
carefully
locked
the
door
it
all
my
fault
celia
knee
he
said
going
straight
to
the
point
as
was
his
way
his
voice
shook
a
little
but
he
went
steadily
on
she
sent
me
down
cellar
after
pickles
and
i
sat
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
finishing
up
a
banana
before
i
went
i
been
down
there
to
look
and
and
the
banana
skin
was
there
all
mashed
it
was
what
did
it
he
choked
and
turned
away
to
the
window
you
left
a
banana
skin
on
those
stairs
lanse
yes
right
there
at
the
top
when
delia
almost
broke
her
neck
more
than
once
going
down
those
stairs
only
last
winter
just
because
they
so
steep
and
narrow
just
nodded
and
you
fell
on
a
banana
skin
once
yourself
and
wanted
to
thrash
the
fellow
who
left
it
just
chin
sank
lower
and
lower
lanse
eyed
him
a
moment
struggling
with
a
desire
to
seize
the
boy
and
punish
him
tremendously
but
as
his
quick
wrath
cooled
a
trifle
in
his
effort
to
control
himself
and
act
wisely
something
about
just
brave
acknowledgment
where
silence
would
have
covered
the
whole
thing
appealed
to
him
the
thought
of
the
way
the
absent
father
and
mother
had
met
every
confession
of
his
own
that
he
could
remember
in
a
life
of
softened
the
words
which
came
next
to
his
lips
well
it
pretty
bad
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
of
regret
i
wonder
it
breaks
you
up
such
a
little
thing
to
do
so
much
mischief
and
so
easy
to
have
avoided
it
all
i
reckon
you
take
care
of
your
banana
skins
after
this
but
i
like
the
way
you
own
up
just
and
so
will
celia
that
something
you
have
been
a
sneak
in
addition
to
being
thoughtless
it
would
have
been
hard
to
forgive
you
if
i
had
found
it
out
while
you
kept
still
it
pretty
hard
as
it
is
he
could
not
help
adding
as
his
imagination
pictured
celia
spending
her
winter
as
a
cripple
just
said
not
a
word
but
the
outline
of
his
profile
against
the
fading
light
at
the
window
was
so
suggestive
of
boyish
despair
that
the
elder
brother
walked
over
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
gives
you
a
chance
to
make
it
up
to
her
in
every
way
you
can
he
said
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
can
do
for
her
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
try
to
square
the
account
a
little
i
will
oh
i
will
cried
poor
just
who
had
longed
for
his
mother
in
this
crisis
and
had
found
facing
the
elder
brother
whom
he
both
admired
and
feared
harder
than
anything
he
had
ever
had
to
do
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
her
if
she
only
forgive
me
she
forgive
you
for
she
made
that
way
it
forgiving
yourself
that
ca
be
done
i
never
shall
do
if
i
thought
you
would
i
thrash
you
on
the
spot
said
lanse
grimly
sure
that
a
wholesome
remorse
was
to
be
encouraged
then
he
relented
sufficiently
to
say
in
a
tone
considerably
less
severe
go
and
wash
up
and
begin
your
good
resolutions
by
getting
down
and
seeing
to
the
kitchen
fire
it
undoubtedly
burnt
itself
out
by
this
time
there
probably
no
dinner
for
anybody
but
we
ca
mind
little
things
like
that
he
went
to
celia
room
at
last
feeling
many
cares
upon
him
a
sensation
which
an
empty
stomach
did
not
tend
to
relieve
he
found
his
sister
able
to
give
him
a
very
but
courageous
smile
and
to
receive
his
earnest
sympathy
with
a
faint
never
mind
dear
do
worry
it
might
have
been
worse
that
seems
to
be
everybody
motto
so
i
accept
it
we
take
courage
and
you
shall
have
us
all
on
our
knees
since
yours
are
laid
up
for
repairs
you
have
had
your
dinner
lanse
murmured
celia
she
was
suffering
severely
but
she
could
not
relax
anything
of
her
anxiety
for
the
family
welfare
oh
i
forgot
there
was
such
a
thing
as
dinner
in
the
world
cried
charlotte
and
was
hurrying
to
the
door
when
celia
called
her
back
wash
that
smudge
off
your
face
she
whispered
and
covered
her
eyes
chapter
iv
coming
from
celia
room
andrew
churchill
made
his
way
through
what
had
now
become
somewhat
familiar
ground
to
the
little
kitchen
as
he
looked
in
at
the
door
he
beheld
a
slim
figure
in
a
big
apron
bending
over
a
chicken
which
lay
in
a
state
of
upon
the
table
as
he
watched
for
a
moment
without
speaking
charlotte
herself
spoke
without
turning
round
you
horrid
thing
she
said
tragically
to
the
chicken
i
hate
you
all
slippery
and
bloody
ugh
why
wo
your
old
windpipe
come
out
how
anybody
can
eat
you
who
has
got
you
ready
i
do
know
may
i
bother
you
for
a
pitcher
of
hot
water
asked
an
even
voice
from
the
doorway
charlotte
turned
with
a
start
her
cheeks
already
flushed
took
on
a
still
ruddier
hue
yes
if
you
please
help
yourself
she
answered
curtly
turning
back
to
her
work
i
am
engaged
i
see
a
congenial
task
very
charlotte
tone
was
expressive
did
i
gather
that
the
fowl
windpipe
was
the
special
cause
of
your
distress
asked
the
even
voice
again
charlotte
faced
round
once
more
doctor
churchill
she
said
i
never
cleaned
a
chicken
in
my
life
i
do
know
what
i
doing
at
all
only
that
i
been
doing
it
for
almost
an
hour
and
it
is
done
i
presume
it
because
i
take
so
much
time
washing
my
hands
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
as
the
doctor
hearty
laugh
filled
the
little
kitchen
i
think
i
can
appreciate
your
feelings
he
remarked
he
walked
over
to
the
table
get
a
good
hold
on
the
offending
windpipe
shut
your
eyes
and
pull
i
afraid
of
doing
something
wrong
you
wo
the
trachea
of
the
domestic
fowl
was
especially
designed
for
the
purpose
only
the
necessary
attachment
for
getting
a
firm
grip
on
it
was
accidentally
omitted
it
certainly
was
charlotte
tugged
away
energetically
for
a
moment
and
drew
out
the
windpipe
successfully
the
doctor
regarded
the
bird
with
a
quizzical
expression
i
should
advise
you
to
cut
up
the
chicken
and
make
a
fricassÃ©e
of
it
he
observed
i
want
to
roast
it
i
got
the
stuffing
all
ready
she
indicated
a
bowlful
of
macerated
mixed
with
milk
and
butter
and
liberally
seasoned
with
pepper
i
see
but
i
a
little
just
a
little
afraid
you
may
have
trouble
in
getting
the
stuffing
to
stay
in
while
the
chicken
is
roasting
you
see
he
paused
i
suppose
i
cut
it
open
too
much
rather
unless
you
a
very
good
amateur
surgeon
and
even
then
i
no
surgeon
i
no
cook
i
never
shall
be
i
do
want
to
be
charlotte
burst
out
suddenly
beginning
to
cut
up
the
chicken
with
vigorous
slashes
mostly
in
the
wrong
places
yes
you
do
hold
on
a
minute
that
joint
is
there
it
farther
down
there
see
once
get
the
anatomy
of
this
bird
in
your
mind
and
it
wo
bother
you
a
bit
to
cut
it
up
pardon
me
miss
charlotte
but
i
know
you
do
want
to
be
a
good
cook
because
you
want
to
be
an
accomplished
woman
charlotte
put
down
her
knife
washed
her
hands
with
furious
haste
got
out
a
pitcher
poured
it
full
of
hot
water
and
handed
it
silently
to
doctor
churchill
without
looking
at
him
he
glanced
from
it
to
her
with
amusement
as
he
received
it
thank
you
he
said
politely
and
walked
away
when
he
came
fifteen
minutes
later
he
found
the
slim
figure
in
the
apron
waiting
for
him
at
the
bottom
as
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
he
noted
as
he
had
done
many
times
already
in
the
short
two
weeks
he
had
known
her
the
peculiar
beauty
of
her
face
it
was
a
beauty
of
which
she
herself
he
had
occasion
to
believe
was
absolutely
unconscious
and
in
this
he
was
right
charlotte
disliked
her
dark
skin
despised
her
black
curls
and
considered
her
vivid
colouring
a
most
undesirable
inheritance
she
admired
intensely
celia
blonde
loveliness
and
lost
no
chance
of
privately
comparing
herself
with
her
sister
to
celia
infinite
advantage
doctor
churchill
she
said
as
he
approached
her
hat
in
hand
i
was
very
rude
to
you
just
now
i
am
sorry
she
held
out
her
hand
doctor
churchill
took
it
charlotte
thick
black
lashes
swept
her
cheek
and
she
did
not
see
the
look
which
rested
on
her
downcast
face
it
all
right
said
doctor
churchill
low
clear
voice
do
think
i
fail
to
understand
what
it
means
for
the
cares
of
a
household
like
this
to
descend
upon
a
girl
shoulders
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
that
they
are
all
immensely
pleased
with
the
pluck
you
are
showing
i
have
seen
your
sister
lunch
tray
several
times
since
i
have
been
coming
here
it
was
perfect
i
burned
her
toast
just
this
morning
said
charlotte
quickly
and
poached
the
egg
too
hard
lanse
says
the
coffee
is
better
but
oh
no
matter
i
just
discouraged
this
morning
i
shall
learn
something
some
time
perhaps
but
she
turned
away
impulsively
doctor
churchill
followed
her
a
step
or
two
see
here
miss
charlotte
he
said
how
many
times
have
you
been
out
of
the
house
since
your
sister
was
hurt
not
at
all
owned
charlotte
except
evenings
after
everything
is
done
then
i
steal
out
and
run
round
and
round
the
house
in
the
moonlight
just
running
it
off
you
know
or
maybe
you
do
know
yes
i
do
will
you
do
something
now
if
i
ask
you
to
very
humbly
charlotte
looked
at
him
doubtfully
if
you
mean
go
for
a
walk
which
is
what
doctors
always
mean
i
believe
i
have
time
doctor
churchill
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
half
past
ten
is
that
chicken
for
luncheon
no
for
supper
or
dinner
i
do
know
just
what
it
is
we
have
at
night
now
i
simply
began
to
get
it
ready
this
morning
because
i
the
least
idea
in
the
world
how
long
it
takes
to
cook
a
chicken
she
was
smiling
a
little
at
the
absurdity
of
her
own
words
and
you
did
want
to
ask
your
sister
i
meant
to
surprise
her
well
of
one
thing
i
am
fairly
confident
said
doctor
churchill
with
gravity
if
you
take
a
run
down
as
far
as
the
old
bridge
and
back
there
will
still
be
time
to
see
to
the
chicken
what
is
more
by
the
time
you
get
back
all
big
obstacles
will
look
like
little
ones
to
you
go
please
i
am
to
be
in
the
office
for
the
next
hour
and
if
the
house
catches
fire
i
will
run
over
and
put
it
out
i
could
even
undertake
to
steal
in
the
back
door
and
put
coal
on
the
kitchen
fire
if
it
is
necessary
it
wo
be
then
will
you
go
perhaps
to
humour
you
promised
charlotte
thank
you
and
remember
please
miss
charlotte
if
you
are
to
do
justice
to
yourself
and
to
your
family
you
must
not
plod
all
the
time
plan
to
get
away
every
day
for
an
hour
or
two
go
to
see
your
friends
anything
but
do
cultivate
nerves
at
eighteen
i
older
than
that
said
charlotte
as
she
watched
him
go
down
the
steps
he
turned
surprised
but
i
shall
not
tell
you
how
much
said
she
and
closed
the
door
doctor
churchill
went
straight
through
his
small
bachelor
house
to
the
kitchen
here
a
tall
thin
woman
with
sharp
eyes
and
kindly
mouth
was
energetically
kneading
bread
fields
said
he
i
wish
you
would
find
it
necessary
morning
to
run
in
at
that
door
over
there
he
indicated
the
little
back
porch
of
the
birch
house
and
borrow
something
fields
eyed
him
as
if
she
thought
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
me
borrow
she
said
doctor
andrew
are
you
no
i
not
crazy
the
doctor
assured
her
smiling
i
know
tremendously
against
your
principles
but
never
mind
the
principles
for
once
since
by
ignoring
them
you
can
do
a
kindness
run
in
and
borrow
a
cup
of
sugar
or
something
and
get
acquainted
who
with
that
girl
with
the
red
cheeks
she
do
want
my
acquaintance
she
would
be
immensely
grateful
for
it
if
it
came
about
naturally
take
over
some
of
your
jelly
for
miss
birch
if
that
way
suits
you
better
but
get
to
know
miss
charlotte
and
show
her
a
few
things
about
cookery
she
trying
to
do
all
the
work
for
the
whole
family
and
she
knows
very
little
about
it
i
suspected
as
much
you
have
told
me
about
and
of
course
being
a
doctor
housekeeper
i
too
well
trained
to
ask
the
doctor
smiled
for
fields
had
been
housekeeper
in
his
family
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
and
she
felt
it
her
right
to
tell
him
now
and
then
what
she
thought
she
was
immensely
proud
of
her
own
ability
to
hold
her
tongue
and
her
curiosity
in
check
so
i
know
only
what
i
seen
you
told
me
the
oldest
girl
had
broke
her
knee
and
that
all
you
said
but
i
see
this
girl
and
opening
the
kitchen
door
to
let
out
the
smoke
each
time
she
burned
up
a
batch
of
something
and
i
guessed
she
was
what
you
might
call
a
graduate
of
one
of
those
you
must
be
a
bit
tactful
warned
the
doctor
the
young
lady
is
a
trifle
sensitive
as
is
natural
over
her
inefficiency
but
she
very
anxious
to
learn
and
there
nobody
to
teach
her
she
is
too
independent
to
go
to
the
other
neighbours
but
i
an
idea
you
could
be
a
friend
to
her
she
looks
pretty
notional
fields
said
doubtfully
shakes
out
her
with
her
chin
in
the
air
to
avoid
the
dust
and
pulls
down
the
shades
the
minute
the
lamp
is
lighted
so
do
you
i
saw
her
lock
the
kitchen
door
in
the
face
of
that
mis
carter
the
other
day
when
she
caught
sight
of
her
coming
up
the
walk
see
here
fieldsy
you
been
spying
on
your
neighbours
said
doctor
churchill
severely
you
despise
that
sort
of
thing
yourself
so
you
must
yield
to
it
go
over
and
be
neighbourly
as
nobody
knows
how
better
than
yourself
but
do
judge
people
by
their
chins
or
their
curls
he
gave
her
angular
shoulder
an
affectionate
pat
looked
straight
into
her
sharp
eyes
for
a
moment
until
they
softened
perceptibly
said
you
all
right
you
know
and
went
whistling
away
that
just
like
your
impudence
andy
churchill
said
hepsibah
fields
to
herself
as
she
laid
her
smooth
loaves
of
into
their
tins
and
proceeded
energetically
to
scrape
the
board
you
always
did
have
a
way
with
you
wheedling
folks
into
doing
what
they
want
to
just
to
please
you
now
i
got
to
go
meddling
in
other
people
business
and
getting
snubbed
most
likely
just
because
trying
to
combine
friendship
and
doctoring
but
fields
when
her
work
was
done
went
to
look
up
her
best
jelly
as
doctor
churchill
had
known
she
would
do
and
hours
had
not
gone
by
before
she
had
made
friends
with
charlotte
birch
it
was
not
hard
to
make
friends
with
the
girl
if
one
went
at
it
aright
fields
came
in
as
charlotte
was
stirring
up
gingerbread
i
do
think
much
of
neighbours
fields
said
but
i
did
want
to
come
to
the
front
door
with
my
jelly
i
thought
maybe
your
sister
would
relish
my
black
raspberry
that
very
kind
of
you
said
charlotte
you
are
i
think
i
seen
you
across
the
way
wo
you
come
in
no
thank
you
you
busy
and
so
am
i
yes
i
doctor
housekeeper
and
his
mother
before
that
the
sharp
eyes
noted
with
approval
in
one
swift
glance
as
charlotte
turned
away
with
the
jelly
the
fact
that
the
little
kitchen
was
in
careful
order
to
be
sure
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
an
hour
when
kitchens
are
supposed
to
be
in
order
if
ever
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
fields
to
find
this
one
in
that
condition
brass
faucets
gleamed
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
the
teakettle
steamed
from
a
shining
spout
the
floor
was
spotless
and
the
table
at
which
charlotte
was
stirring
her
gingerbread
had
been
scrubbed
until
it
was
as
nearly
white
as
pine
boards
can
be
made
gingerbread
said
the
housekeeper
lingering
in
the
doorway
i
always
like
to
make
that
it
seems
the
biggest
result
for
the
smallest
labour
of
anything
you
can
make
and
it
smells
so
spicy
when
it
comes
out
of
the
oven
yes
when
it
is
burned
agreed
charlotte
with
a
laugh
things
had
gone
fairly
well
with
her
that
day
and
her
spirits
had
risen
accordingly
burning
a
thing
that
will
happen
to
the
best
cooks
once
in
a
while
was
just
day
before
yesterday
i
blacked
a
pumpkin
pie
so
the
doctor
poked
his
fun
at
me
all
the
time
he
was
eating
it
said
the
housekeeper
with
a
tactful
disregard
for
the
full
truth
which
was
that
a
refractory
small
patient
in
the
office
had
driven
the
doctor
to
require
her
assistance
for
a
longer
period
than
was
consistent
with
attention
to
her
oven
oh
did
you
asked
charlotte
eagerly
that
encourages
me
doctor
churchill
told
me
he
had
the
finest
cook
in
the
state
and
i
been
envying
you
ever
since
doctor
churchill
had
better
be
careful
how
he
brags
fields
declared
much
gratified
well
now
i
tell
you
what
you
do
it
ai
but
a
step
across
the
two
back
yards
when
you
get
in
a
quandary
how
to
cook
anything
how
long
to
give
it
or
whether
to
bake
or
boil
you
just
run
across
and
ask
me
i
ai
one
o
the
prying
kind
the
doctor
tell
you
that
and
you
need
be
afraid
it
go
any
further
i
know
how
hard
it
must
be
for
a
young
girl
like
you
to
take
the
care
of
a
house
on
yourself
and
i
be
pleased
to
show
you
anything
i
can
that
very
good
of
you
said
charlotte
gratefully
as
fields
went
briskly
down
the
steps
and
she
really
felt
that
it
was
she
would
have
resented
the
appearance
of
almost
any
of
her
neighbours
at
her
back
door
with
an
offer
of
help
suspecting
that
they
had
come
to
use
their
eyes
and
afterward
their
tongues
in
criticism
but
something
about
hepsibah
fields
disarmed
her
at
once
she
could
not
tell
why
this
gingerbread
is
perfect
said
celia
an
hour
later
when
charlotte
had
brought
up
her
supper
you
are
improving
every
day
but
it
frets
me
not
to
have
you
come
to
me
for
help
i
could
plan
things
for
you
and
teach
you
all
the
little
i
know
i
doing
so
well
now
the
doctor
says
i
may
get
on
the
couch
by
next
week
then
you
certainly
must
let
me
do
my
part
but
charlotte
shook
her
head
obstinately
i
going
to
fight
it
through
myself
i
rather
you
enough
to
do
writing
letters
when
lanse
came
into
celia
room
that
evening
his
first
words
were
merry
what
i
anxious
to
know
he
said
is
what
you
did
with
your
rice
pudding
charlotte
says
you
ate
it
and
the
inference
was
that
it
was
good
to
eat
so
i
ate
mine
manfully
i
assure
you
but
it
was
a
bitter
dose
poor
little
girl
she
tries
so
hard
lanse
and
the
gingerbread
was
very
good
so
it
was
it
helped
take
out
the
taste
of
the
pudding
did
you
honestly
eat
that
pudding
see
here
celia
beckoned
him
close
she
reached
a
cautious
hand
under
her
pillow
and
drew
out
her
please
get
rid
of
it
for
me
she
whispered
and
wash
the
dish
i
could
bear
not
to
seem
to
eat
it
so
i
slipped
it
in
there
striving
to
smother
his
mirth
lanse
bore
the
away
returning
with
it
he
carefully
replaced
the
soap
and
set
the
dish
on
the
stand
where
it
had
been
within
celia
reach
i
wish
i
had
had
a
at
the
table
he
remarked
but
the
cook
eye
was
upon
me
and
i
had
to
stand
up
to
it
but
see
here
i
a
letter
for
you
from
uncle
rayburn
celia
stretched
an
eager
hand
for
a
letter
from
uncle
john
rayburn
a
bachelor
and
an
officer
retired
by
an
incurable
injury
which
did
not
make
him
the
less
the
best
uncle
in
the
world
could
not
fail
to
be
welcome
but
she
had
not
read
a
page
before
she
dropped
the
sheet
and
stared
helplessly
and
anxiously
at
lanse
what
up
he
asked
why
uncle
rayburn
writes
that
he
would
like
to
come
to
spend
the
winter
with
us
answered
celia
what
luck
luck
with
charlotte
in
the
kitchen
uncle
ray
is
a
of
a
cook
himself
his
board
bill
will
help
out
like
oil
on
a
dry
axle
and
if
we
do
have
a
lot
of
fun
then
uncle
ray
has
changed
as
i
know
he
has
chapter
v
two
cripples
declared
capt
john
rayburn
honourably
discharged
from
active
service
in
the
united
states
army
on
account
of
permanent
disability
from
injuries
received
in
the
philippines
two
cripples
should
be
able
to
keep
a
household
properly
stirred
up
i
been
here
five
days
now
and
my
soul
longs
for
some
frivolity
he
leaned
back
in
his
big
wicker
armchair
and
looked
quizzically
across
at
his
niece
celia
who
lay
upon
her
couch
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
gave
him
a
somewhat
smile
in
return
four
weeks
of
enforced
quiet
were
beginning
to
tell
on
her
some
frivolity
repeated
captain
rayburn
as
charlotte
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
what
do
you
say
charlie
girl
shall
we
have
some
fun
dear
me
yes
uncle
ray
charlotte
responded
promptly
if
you
can
think
how
i
can
is
there
a
birthday
or
anything
that
we
may
celebrate
i
no
compunction
about
getting
up
festivities
on
any
pretext
but
if
there
happened
to
be
a
birthday
handy
november
yes
why
we
had
forgotten
all
about
it
lanse
birthday
is
the
fourth
that
day
after
good
can
you
make
him
a
if
not
i
oh
yes
i
can
cried
charlotte
eagerly
i
just
learned
an
all
right
then
we
order
a
few
little
things
from
town
and
have
a
jollification
not
a
very
big
one
on
account
of
the
lady
on
the
couch
there
who
reminds
me
at
the
moment
of
a
whom
some
one
has
picked
and
then
left
on
the
stern
seat
in
the
sun
she
looks
very
sweet
but
a
trifle
limp
celia
smile
was
several
degrees
brighter
than
the
previous
one
had
been
nobody
could
resist
uncle
ray
when
he
began
to
exert
himself
to
cheer
people
up
he
was
a
young
or
an
old
bachelor
according
to
one
point
of
view
being
not
yet
forty
and
looking
in
spite
of
the
past
suffering
which
had
brought
into
his
chestnut
hair
two
patches
of
gray
at
the
temples
very
much
like
a
boy
with
an
irrepressible
spirit
of
energy
and
interest
in
the
life
about
him
it
could
hardly
be
doubted
that
capt
john
rayburn
apparently
invalided
for
life
and
cut
off
from
the
activity
which
had
been
his
dearest
delight
must
have
his
hours
of
depression
but
nobody
had
ever
caught
him
in
one
of
them
i
should
like
some
music
at
this
festival
captain
rayburn
went
on
is
the
orchestra
out
of
practice
we
have
played
for
six
weeks
charlotte
said
and
celia
first
violin
you
could
play
bolstered
up
celia
shook
her
head
i
should
be
tired
in
ten
minutes
i
not
so
sure
of
that
but
we
see
anyhow
i
the
old
flute
here
oh
fine
cried
charlotte
suppose
we
ask
doctor
forester
out
and
your
young
doctor
here
next
door
and
two
or
three
of
your
girl
friends
and
a
boy
and
girl
or
two
for
jeff
and
just
what
a
funny
mixture
uncle
ray
doctor
forester
and
norman
carter
just
chum
and
carolyn
houghton
funny
is
it
inquired
captain
rayburn
undisturbed
now
do
you
know
that
my
ideal
of
a
company
particularly
when
all
the
family
are
to
be
here
invite
somebody
for
each
one
mix
all
up
play
some
jolly
games
and
you
find
doctor
forester
vying
with
norman
carter
for
the
prize
and
enjoying
it
equally
well
it
sharpens
up
the
young
wits
to
be
pitted
against
the
older
ones
and
it
well
it
burnishes
the
elder
rapiers
and
keeps
them
keen
all
right
this
is
your
party
agreed
charlotte
and
she
went
back
to
her
duties
you
not
afraid
it
will
be
too
much
for
you
little
girl
captain
rayburn
asked
celia
whose
smile
had
faded
and
who
lay
with
her
head
turned
away
oh
no
mercury
a
little
low
in
the
tube
this
morning
just
a
little
any
good
reason
why
except
the
best
reason
in
the
world
heavy
atmospheric
pressure
knee
a
trifle
slow
to
become
a
solid
capable
energetic
knee
such
as
its
owner
demands
owner
a
bit
restless
physically
and
mentally
plans
for
the
winter
upset
second
lieutenant
winning
spurs
while
the
colonel
lies
in
the
hospital
tent
fighting
imaginary
battles
and
trying
to
keep
cool
under
the
strain
celia
looked
round
and
smiled
again
but
her
head
went
back
to
its
old
position
and
tears
forced
themselves
out
from
under
the
eyelids
which
she
shut
tightly
together
and
a
little
current
of
anxiety
for
the
inhabitants
of
new
mexico
keeps
flowing
under
the
edge
of
the
tent
and
makes
the
colonel
fear
it
not
pitched
in
the
right
place
celia
nodded
well
that
not
warranted
in
the
face
of
the
facts
latest
advices
from
new
mexico
report
improvement
even
sooner
than
we
could
have
expected
then
at
home
lanse
is
conquering
the
situation
in
the
locomotive
shops
very
satisfactorily
doctor
churchill
told
me
yesterday
that
he
won
the
liking
of
nearly
all
the
men
in
his
shop
which
means
more
than
a
girl
like
you
can
guess
jeff
and
just
are
prospering
in
school
according
to
charlotte
who
is
herself
working
up
in
her
new
profession
and
whose
last
beefsteak
was
broiled
to
a
turn
as
her
critical
soldier
guest
appreciates
as
for
celia
he
got
to
his
feet
slowly
grasped
his
two
stout
hickory
canes
and
limped
across
the
room
to
the
couch
showing
as
he
went
a
pitiful
weakness
in
the
tall
figure
whose
lines
still
suggested
the
martial
bearing
which
it
had
not
long
ago
presented
and
which
it
might
never
present
again
captain
rayburn
sat
down
close
beside
celia
and
took
her
hand
in
one
thing
i
made
a
misstatement
he
said
softly
they
not
imaginary
battles
that
the
colonel
lies
fighting
in
the
hospital
tent
they
real
enough
there
was
a
short
silence
then
celia
spoke
unsteadily
from
the
depths
of
her
pillow
uncle
ray
were
you
ever
mean
enough
to
be
jealous
the
captain
looked
quickly
at
the
fair
head
on
the
pillow
jealous
said
he
without
a
hint
of
surprise
in
his
voice
why
yes
jealous
of
my
colonel
my
lieutenants
my
orderlies
my
privates
my
doctors
my
nurses
jealous
of
the
very
filipino
prisoners
themselves
because
they
all
had
legs
and
could
walk
oh
i
know
i
do
mean
that
cried
celia
of
course
you
envied
everybody
who
could
walk
poor
uncle
ray
but
you
were
small
enough
to
mind
because
the
officers
under
you
had
got
your
chance
was
i
though
well
maybe
i
was
said
the
captain
speaking
low
perhaps
i
did
lie
and
grind
my
teeth
when
they
told
me
about
the
gallant
work
lieutenant
garretson
had
done
with
my
men
at
balangiga
a
mere
boy
garretson
the
whole
world
applauded
it
if
i
not
been
knocked
out
so
soon
it
would
have
been
my
name
that
would
have
gone
into
history
yes
i
chewed
that
to
shreds
many
a
sleepless
night
and
hated
the
fellow
for
getting
my
chance
captain
rayburn
drew
a
long
breath
while
his
fingers
relaxed
for
an
instant
and
it
was
celia
hand
which
tightened
over
his
but
i
got
past
that
he
said
quietly
it
came
to
me
all
at
once
that
garretson
and
the
other
fellows
in
active
service
were
the
only
ones
with
chances
before
them
i
had
mine
a
different
commission
from
the
one
i
had
coveted
to
be
sure
but
a
broader
one
with
infinite
possibilities
and
no
fear
of
missing
further
promotion
if
i
earned
it
there
was
a
little
stillness
after
that
when
the
captain
looked
down
at
celia
again
he
found
her
eyes
full
of
pity
but
this
time
it
was
not
pity
for
herself
he
comprehended
instantly
no
i
do
need
it
dear
he
said
very
gently
i
learned
some
things
already
in
the
hospital
tent
i
would
have
missed
for
a
pay
and
you
who
are
to
be
only
temporarily
on
the
list
you
do
need
to
mind
that
the
little
second
lieutenant
but
the
second
lieutenant
was
rushing
into
the
room
bearing
on
a
plate
a
great
puffy
round
loaf
brown
and
spicy
look
she
cried
at
my
steamed
brown
bread
i
tried
it
four
times
and
slumped
it
every
time
now
fieldsy
has
shown
me
what
was
the
matter
i
had
flour
enough
fieldsy
is
a
dear
and
so
are
you
she
plunged
at
celia
brown
bread
and
all
and
kissed
the
top
of
her
head
tweaked
a
lock
of
captain
rayburn
thick
hair
and
was
flying
away
when
celia
spoke
you
the
biggest
dear
of
anybody
she
said
with
a
smile
it
was
getting
up
a
party
in
a
hurry
but
somehow
the
thing
was
accomplished
whether
lanse
remembered
his
own
birthday
at
all
was
a
question
when
he
came
home
at
six
on
that
day
charlotte
told
him
that
she
had
special
reasons
for
seeing
him
in
his
best
why
you
all
dressed
up
yourself
he
observed
what
up
doctor
forester
coming
out
to
hear
us
play
was
all
she
would
tell
him
and
lanse
groaned
over
the
fact
that
the
little
orchestra
was
so
out
of
practice
when
the
guests
arrived
they
found
the
man
with
the
birthday
anxiously
looking
over
scores
he
greeted
them
with
enthusiasm
doctor
forester
this
is
good
of
you
if
we
ca
play
worth
a
copper
cent
miss
atkinson
well
this
is
a
surprise
a
delightful
one
miss
carolyn
how
goes
school
how
are
you
norman
you
find
just
in
a
minute
miss
houghton
now
you
and
i
can
settle
that
little
question
we
were
discussing
charlotte
you
rogue
you
and
uncle
ray
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
ah
doctor
churchill
this
would
have
been
complete
without
our
neighbour
miss
atkinson
allow
me
to
present
doctor
churchill
thus
john
lansing
birch
accepted
at
once
and
with
his
accustomed
ease
the
rÃ´le
of
host
and
enjoyed
himself
immensely
celia
watching
him
from
her
couch
said
suddenly
to
captain
rayburn
who
sat
beside
her
this
is
just
what
the
family
needed
if
you
had
come
we
should
probably
have
gone
drudging
on
all
winter
without
realising
what
was
the
matter
with
us
no
wonder
poor
lanse
appreciates
it
he
had
a
month
of
hard
labour
without
an
enlivening
hour
and
charlotte
does
she
look
like
a
fresh
carnation
very
much
agreed
the
captain
with
approving
eyes
on
his
younger
niece
who
wore
her
best
frock
of
french
gray
a
tint
which
set
off
her
warm
colouring
to
advantage
celia
had
thrust
several
of
captain
rayburn
scarlet
carnations
into
her
sister
belt
with
a
result
gratifying
to
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
still
remarked
the
captain
his
glance
returning
to
celia
i
not
sure
that
i
can
say
whether
a
fresh
carnation
is
to
be
preferred
to
a
newly
picked
rose
that
pale
pink
gown
you
are
wearing
is
certainly
a
joy
to
the
eye
celia
blushed
under
his
admiring
glance
there
could
be
no
question
that
she
was
very
lovely
if
a
trifle
frail
in
appearance
from
her
quiet
and
it
was
comforting
to
be
assured
that
she
was
not
looking
like
a
limp
when
are
we
to
hear
the
orchestra
cried
doctor
forester
after
an
hour
of
lively
talk
a
game
or
two
and
some
remarkable
puzzles
contributed
by
just
the
distinguished
gentleman
from
the
city
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
for
he
was
accustomed
to
social
functions
of
a
far
more
elaborate
and
formal
sort
and
liked
nothing
better
than
to
join
in
a
frolic
with
the
younger
people
when
such
rare
opportunities
presented
of
course
we
horribly
out
of
practice
and
all
that
explained
lanse
distributing
scores
and
helping
to
prop
up
celia
so
that
she
might
try
to
play
but
since
you
insist
we
give
you
all
you
want
in
a
very
few
minutes
here
your
flute
uncle
ray
if
you
play
along
with
celia
it
will
help
out
it
was
not
so
bad
after
all
lanse
had
chosen
the
most
familiar
of
the
old
music
everybody
did
his
and
her
best
and
captain
rayburn
flute
exquisitely
played
did
indeed
help
out
celia
her
cheeks
very
pink
worked
away
until
doctor
churchill
gently
took
her
violin
from
her
but
after
that
the
music
still
went
very
well
good
good
applauded
doctor
forester
churchill
you
in
luck
to
live
next
door
to
this
sort
of
thing
now
that
i
know
what
i
live
next
door
to
remarked
the
younger
physician
i
shall
know
what
to
prescribe
for
the
entire
family
on
winter
evenings
there
could
be
no
question
that
doctor
churchill
also
was
enjoying
the
evening
helping
charlotte
and
the
boys
serve
the
sandwiches
and
chocolate
which
appeared
presently
the
chocolate
being
made
by
fields
in
the
kitchen
he
said
to
the
girl
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
since
i
came
away
from
my
old
home
it
was
so
nice
of
fieldsy
to
make
the
chocolate
charlotte
replied
somewhat
irrelevantly
then
as
the
doctor
looked
quickly
at
her
and
laughed
she
flushed
oh
i
do
call
her
that
to
her
face
she
said
hurriedly
i
do
think
she
would
mind
that
what
andy
churchill
called
her
and
calls
her
yet
when
he
forgets
her
newly
acquired
dignity
as
a
doctor
housekeeper
i
mighty
glad
fieldsy
can
be
of
service
to
you
you
won
her
heart
completely
and
i
assure
you
that
a
bigger
triumph
than
you
realise
she
the
nicest
neighbour
we
ever
had
said
charlotte
gaily
the
doctor
paused
delayed
them
both
a
moment
while
he
rearranged
a
pile
of
spoons
and
forks
upon
his
tray
and
said
if
you
talk
of
neighbours
miss
charlotte
there
a
certain
homesick
young
doctor
who
appreciates
having
neighbours
too
charlotte
answered
as
lightly
as
he
had
spoken
with
fields
in
the
kitchen
and
you
in
here
with
a
tray
full
of
hospitality
i
sure
you
seem
very
much
like
one
of
our
oldest
neighbours
thank
you
he
answered
with
such
a
glad
little
ring
in
his
voice
that
charlotte
could
not
be
sorry
for
the
impulsive
speech
but
she
found
herself
wondering
more
than
once
during
the
evening
what
he
had
meant
by
calling
himself
homesick
see
here
fields
called
jeff
hurrying
out
for
fresh
supplies
this
is
the
best
chocolate
ever
brewed
doctor
forester
wants
another
cup
and
all
the
fellows
looked
sort
of
wistful
when
they
heard
him
ask
for
it
may
everybody
have
another
cup
well
i
must
say
mr
jefferson
said
fields
in
astonishment
i
thought
miss
charlotte
was
going
clean
crazy
when
she
would
have
three
made
but
it
seems
she
knew
her
friends
appetites
you
know
it
ai
considered
proper
to
pass
more
than
one
cup
light
refreshments
like
these
oh
this
is
any
of
your
affairs
i
can
tell
you
that
declared
jeff
watching
with
pleasure
the
filling
of
the
tall
chocolate
pot
people
know
they
are
going
to
get
something
good
when
they
come
here
i
warned
the
fellows
not
to
eat
too
much
supper
before
they
came
any
more
of
those
chicken
sandwiches
for
the
land
sake
mr
jeff
cried
fields
what
the
matter
jeffy
asked
charlotte
coming
out
doctor
churchill
was
behind
her
bearing
an
empty
salad
bowl
i
want
more
sandwiches
demanded
jeff
everybody
fall
to
quick
and
make
them
commanded
charlotte
norman
carter
and
just
have
had
seven
apiece
that
makes
them
go
fast
well
i
never
breathed
the
housekeeper
once
more
but
charlotte
was
slicing
the
bread
with
a
rapid
hand
the
doctor
laughing
undertook
to
butter
the
slices
and
jeff
would
have
spread
on
the
chicken
if
fields
had
not
taken
the
knife
from
his
hand
ten
minutes
later
jeff
was
able
to
announce
that
everybody
seemed
to
be
satisfied
that
a
mercy
said
fields
handing
him
a
tray
full
of
pink
and
white
ices
captain
rayburn
contribution
to
the
festivities
have
to
give
now
if
they
was
carry
that
careful
and
tell
miss
charlotte
to
send
out
for
the
cake
i
light
the
candles
doctor
churchill
came
out
alone
for
the
cake
it
stood
ready
upon
the
table
charlotte
greatest
success
a
big
orange
with
pale
yellow
icing
pale
yellow
candles
surrounding
it
in
a
flaming
circle
and
one
great
yellow
marÃ©chal
niel
rose
in
the
centre
that
a
beauty
cried
doctor
churchill
did
you
make
it
fieldsy
indeed
i
did
denied
fields
with
great
satisfaction
miss
charlotte
made
it
herself
and
i
did
know
but
she
go
crazy
over
it
first
for
fear
it
would
turn
out
right
and
then
for
joy
because
it
had
the
doctor
handed
it
about
with
a
face
so
beaming
that
doctor
forester
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
his
young
colleague
quizzically
you
make
this
cake
churchill
he
asked
the
doctor
laughed
it
was
joy
enough
to
bring
it
in
he
said
who
did
make
it
demanded
forester
it
was
no
caterer
i
know
charlotte
attempted
to
escape
quietly
from
the
room
but
lanse
barred
the
way
here
she
is
he
said
and
turned
his
sister
about
and
made
her
face
the
company
a
friendly
round
of
applause
greeted
her
mingled
with
exclamations
of
surprise
they
all
knew
charlotte
or
thought
they
did
to
most
of
them
this
was
a
new
and
accomplishment
it
not
half
so
good
as
the
sort
celia
makes
murmured
charlotte
and
would
hear
no
more
of
the
cake
but
celia
in
her
corner
said
softly
to
doctor
forester
it
going
to
be
worth
while
my
knee
for
the
training
charlotte
is
getting
she
be
a
perfect
little
housekeeper
before
i
about
again
it
going
to
be
worth
while
in
another
way
too
returned
her
friend
with
an
appreciative
glance
at
the
face
which
always
reminded
him
of
her
mother
it
was
so
serenely
sweet
and
full
of
character
it
is
how
she
asked
eagerly
for
his
tone
was
emphatic
i
have
few
patients
on
my
list
who
learn
so
soon
to
bear
this
sort
of
thing
as
quietly
as
you
are
bearing
it
he
said
do
think
that
does
count
then
he
rose
to
go
celia
hardly
heard
the
her
mind
was
so
happily
busy
with
this
bit
of
rare
praise
from
one
whose
respect
was
well
worth
earning
and
half
an
hour
afterward
as
lanse
stooped
to
gather
her
up
and
carry
her
to
bed
she
looked
back
at
captain
rayburn
who
still
sat
beside
her
couch
and
said
with
softly
shining
eyes
the
colonel
would
be
the
second
lieutenant
if
he
could
uncle
ray
lanse
lifting
his
sister
in
his
strong
arms
remarked
i
should
say
not
why
should
he
celia
and
captain
rayburn
laughing
exchanged
a
sympathetic
comprehending
glance
chapter
vi
three
times
jefferson
birch
knocked
on
his
sister
charlotte
door
then
he
turned
the
knob
the
door
would
not
open
fiddle
he
called
softly
but
got
no
reply
you
not
asleep
i
know
he
said
firmly
at
the
keyhole
i
can
see
a
light
from
outside
if
you
have
got
it
all
plugged
up
here
let
me
in
i
some
important
news
for
you
charlotte
lock
turned
and
she
threw
the
door
open
well
come
in
she
said
i
did
mean
anybody
to
know
but
i
dying
to
tell
somebody
and
i
can
trust
you
of
course
affirmed
jeff
entering
with
an
air
of
curiosity
doing
painting
the
table
by
the
window
was
strewn
with
artist
materials
drawings
sheets
of
paper
and
tumblers
of
coloured
water
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
lay
one
piece
of
nearly
finished
work
the
interior
of
an
unfurnished
room
showing
wall
decoration
and
nothing
more
the
colouring
caught
jeff
eye
that
stunning
he
commented
catching
up
the
board
upon
which
the
colour
drawing
was
stretched
what
it
for
going
to
put
in
some
furniture
charlotte
laughed
no
i
not
going
to
put
in
any
furniture
she
said
this
is
just
to
show
a
scheme
for
decorating
a
den
a
man
den
do
you
really
like
it
it
great
jeff
stood
the
board
up
against
the
wall
and
backed
away
studying
it
with
interest
those
dull
reds
and
blues
will
show
off
his
guns
and
pictures
and
things
in
fine
shape
how
did
you
ever
think
it
up
charlotte
brought
out
some
sheets
of
as
jeff
thought
but
he
saw
at
once
that
they
were
they
represented
in
detail
the
paper
used
upon
the
den
walls
jeff
studied
them
with
interest
so
this
is
where
you
are
evenings
after
you
slip
away
you
sitting
up
late
too
see
here
this
wo
do
oh
yes
it
will
do
try
to
stop
me
jeff
i
not
up
late
really
i
not
only
once
in
awhile
i
thought
people
could
paint
by
artificial
light
they
can
when
they
get
used
to
the
difference
it
makes
but
i
do
only
the
drudgery
evenings
outlines
and
solid
filling
in
and
that
sort
of
thing
going
to
show
this
to
somebody
oh
do
talk
about
it
said
charlotte
breathlessly
if
i
can
get
my
courage
up
you
know
murdock
with
that
decorating
house
where
the
deckers
had
their
work
done
well
some
day
i
going
to
show
him
but
i
so
frightened
at
my
own
audacity
if
he
does
like
this
he
a
fool
declared
jeff
vigorously
and
although
charlotte
laughed
she
felt
the
encouragement
of
his
boyish
approval
putting
away
her
work
she
suddenly
remembered
the
excuse
her
brother
had
given
for
forcing
his
way
into
her
room
you
said
you
had
important
news
for
me
did
you
mean
it
or
was
that
only
to
get
in
oh
said
jeff
sitting
down
suddenly
and
looking
up
at
her
his
face
growing
grave
you
put
it
out
of
my
head
when
i
came
in
i
met
the
doctor
just
now
he
been
to
see
annie
donohue
she
worse
charlotte
dropped
her
work
instantly
worse
she
said
all
the
brightness
flying
from
her
face
why
i
was
in
yesterday
and
she
seemed
much
better
jeff
i
must
go
down
there
this
minute
it
after
ten
you
ca
wait
till
morning
oh
no
the
girl
was
making
ready
as
she
spoke
you
go
with
me
think
of
the
baby
there
be
a
houseful
of
women
all
wailing
if
anything
goes
wrong
with
annie
they
did
it
before
when
they
thought
she
was
doing
well
the
baby
was
so
frightened
she
knows
me
of
course
i
must
go
think
what
mother
would
do
for
annie
after
all
the
years
annie
was
such
a
faithful
maid
that
brought
jeff
round
at
once
in
ten
minutes
he
and
charlotte
had
quietly
left
the
house
a
rapid
walk
through
the
crisp
january
night
brought
them
to
the
poorer
quarter
of
the
town
and
the
donohue
cottage
a
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
met
them
just
outside
annie
gone
she
said
at
sight
of
charlotte
took
a
turn
for
the
worse
an
hour
ago
i
never
thought
she
get
well
she
had
too
hard
a
life
with
that
brute
of
a
man
of
hers
charlotte
stood
still
on
the
when
the
woman
had
gone
on
she
was
thinking
hard
jeff
remained
quiet
beside
her
charlotte
had
known
more
of
annie
than
he
annie
had
been
charlotte
nurse
all
at
once
charlotte
turned
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
jeff
she
said
very
softly
and
close
to
his
ear
we
must
take
little
ellen
home
with
us
what
yes
we
must
she
such
a
shy
little
thing
every
time
i
been
here
i
found
her
frightened
half
to
death
it
worried
annie
dreadfully
well
but
charlotte
some
of
these
women
can
take
care
of
her
friends
they
are
not
annie
friends
they
just
her
neighbours
not
kind
at
all
they
enough
but
it
distressed
annie
all
the
time
to
have
any
of
them
take
care
of
ellen
they
give
her
all
sorts
of
things
to
eat
she
only
a
baby
she
was
when
i
was
here
thursday
oh
do
make
a
fuss
jeff
please
dear
but
you
do
know
anything
about
babies
i
know
enough
not
to
give
them
pork
and
cabbage
i
can
put
the
little
thing
to
sleep
in
just
crib
it
up
in
the
attic
you
can
get
it
down
jeff
we
must
but
jeff
still
held
her
firmly
by
the
arm
girl
you
crazy
if
you
once
take
her
you
got
her
on
your
hands
annie
has
no
relations
you
told
me
that
yourself
the
child
have
to
go
to
an
asylum
it
a
good
thing
that
husband
of
hers
is
dead
if
he
was
you
have
some
cause
to
be
worried
jeff
said
charlotte
pleadingly
you
must
let
me
do
what
i
think
is
right
i
could
sleep
thinking
of
little
ellen
besides
when
annie
was
worrying
about
her
thursday
i
as
much
as
promised
see
that
no
harm
came
to
the
baby
jeff
relaxed
his
hold
i
never
saw
such
a
girl
he
grumbled
as
if
you
had
things
enough
on
your
shoulders
already
without
adopting
other
people
kids
andrew
churchill
opened
the
door
which
led
from
the
room
of
one
of
his
patients
into
the
small
slenderly
furnished
of
the
tiny
house
which
had
been
her
home
it
was
her
home
no
longer
doctor
churchill
had
just
lost
his
first
patient
in
private
practice
in
the
room
were
several
women
gathered
about
a
baby
not
yet
two
years
old
over
the
child
a
subdued
but
excited
discussion
was
being
held
as
to
who
should
take
home
and
for
the
present
care
for
poor
annie
donohue
orphan
baby
doctor
churchill
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
baby
a
pretty
little
girl
with
a
pair
of
big
frightened
blue
eyes
well
i
guess
i
have
to
be
the
one
said
the
youngest
woman
of
the
company
with
a
sigh
you
all
worse
fixed
than
i
am
and
i
guess
we
can
make
room
for
her
somehow
till
it
decided
what
to
do
with
her
poor
mis
donohue
child
has
got
to
stay
somewhere
besides
here
that
i
do
say
well
that
kind
of
you
mary
and
we
all
lend
a
hand
to
help
you
out
i
bring
over
some
extra
milk
i
can
spare
and
a
sudden
draft
of
january
air
made
everybody
turn
a
girlish
figure
in
a
big
dark
cape
with
a
scarlet
lining
which
seemed
to
reflect
the
colour
from
a
face
brilliant
with
stood
in
the
outer
door
the
next
instant
charlotte
birch
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
had
crossed
the
room
and
was
addressing
the
women
in
low
quick
tones
the
doctor
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
i
come
for
the
baby
she
said
with
a
gentle
imperiousness
just
heard
about
poor
annie
of
course
we
are
the
ones
to
see
to
little
ellen
if
mother
were
here
she
would
insist
upon
it
where
are
her
wraps
please
and
has
one
of
you
an
extra
shawl
she
can
lend
me
it
a
sharp
night
as
she
spoke
charlotte
knelt
before
the
child
and
held
out
her
arms
baby
ellen
stared
at
her
for
an
instant
then
seemed
to
recognise
a
friend
and
lifted
two
little
arms
her
tiny
lips
quivering
charlotte
drew
her
gently
up
and
rising
walked
away
across
the
room
with
her
the
small
golden
head
nestling
in
her
neck
the
women
looked
after
her
rather
resentfully
i
suppose
the
child
would
be
sufferin
with
such
as
us
said
one
if
we
ai
got
no
silk
quilts
to
put
over
her
neither
have
i
said
charlotte
with
a
smile
as
she
caught
the
words
but
i
so
fond
of
her
annie
was
my
nurse
you
know
may
i
carry
her
home
for
you
asked
the
doctor
at
her
elbow
jeff
is
here
she
answered
but
it
was
the
doctor
who
carried
the
baby
after
all
for
she
cried
at
sight
of
jeff
she
was
ready
to
cry
at
sight
of
any
strange
face
poor
little
frightened
child
but
doctor
churchill
held
her
so
tenderly
and
spoke
so
soothingly
that
she
grew
quiet
at
once
it
was
a
silent
walk
and
it
was
only
as
they
reached
the
house
that
the
doctor
said
softly
to
charlotte
if
you
need
advice
or
help
hesitate
to
call
on
fields
she
a
wise
woman
and
her
heart
is
warm
you
know
yes
i
know
thank
you
and
thank
you
doctor
for
not
scolding
me
about
this
scold
you
he
said
as
charlotte
took
the
baby
from
him
at
the
door
why
should
i
do
that
jeff
did
and
i
did
dare
tell
lanse
if
you
had
brought
the
baby
home
whispered
the
doctor
i
should
have
and
charlotte
looking
quickly
up
at
him
as
jeff
opened
the
door
and
the
light
streamed
out
upon
them
surprised
upon
his
face
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
baby
pink
cheek
an
expression
which
could
hardly
have
been
more
tender
if
he
had
been
ellen
father
now
jeffy
get
the
crib
down
please
as
softly
as
you
can
begged
charlotte
when
she
had
laid
the
baby
on
her
own
white
bed
and
noiselessly
closed
the
door
jeff
tried
hard
to
do
her
bidding
but
the
crib
did
not
get
without
a
few
scrapings
and
bumpings
which
made
charlotte
hold
her
breath
lest
they
rouse
a
sleeping
household
now
go
down
and
warm
some
milk
for
her
in
the
blue
basin
do
get
it
hot
just
lukewarm
put
the
tiniest
pinch
of
sugar
in
it
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
babies
jeff
murmured
pausing
an
instant
to
watch
his
sister
gently
pulling
off
the
baby
clothes
i
do
did
i
have
the
care
of
you
answered
charlotte
with
a
mischievous
smile
two
years
younger
than
yourself
oh
of
course
i
forgot
that
and
jeff
crept
away
after
the
milk
it
took
him
some
time
and
when
he
came
tiptoeing
back
he
found
the
baby
in
her
little
coarse
flannel
nightgown
her
round
blue
eyes
again
she
seems
to
accept
you
for
a
mother
all
right
he
commented
as
charlotte
held
the
cup
to
the
baby
lips
cuddling
her
in
a
blanket
meanwhile
but
the
girl
eyes
filled
at
this
remembering
poor
annie
and
jeff
added
hastily
what
happen
if
she
wakes
up
and
cries
in
the
night
babies
usually
do
do
they
annie
has
always
said
ellen
did
much
and
she
getting
to
sleep
so
late
i
hope
she
wo
i
do
feel
equal
to
telling
the
others
what
i
done
till
morning
and
charlotte
smiled
rather
faintly
now
that
she
had
the
baby
at
home
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
lanse
and
celia
would
say
never
mind
i
stand
by
you
you
all
right
whatever
you
do
if
i
did
think
you
were
rather
off
your
head
at
first
promised
jeff
sturdily
he
was
never
known
to
fail
charlotte
in
an
emergency
whether
it
was
the
strange
surroundings
or
something
wrong
about
the
last
meal
of
the
day
can
not
be
stated
but
baby
ellen
did
wake
up
it
was
at
three
in
the
morning
that
charlotte
who
excited
by
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
had
but
just
fallen
asleep
was
roused
by
a
small
wail
the
baby
seemed
not
to
know
her
in
the
trailing
blue
kimono
with
her
two
long
curly
braids
swinging
over
her
shoulders
and
in
spite
of
all
that
charlotte
could
do
the
infantile
anguish
of
spirit
soon
filled
the
house
charlotte
walked
the
floor
with
her
alternately
murmuring
consolation
and
singing
the
lullabies
of
her
own
childhood
but
the
uproar
continued
it
is
astonishing
what
an
amount
of
disturbance
one
small
pair
of
lungs
can
produce
it
was
not
long
before
the
anxious
nurse
listening
with
both
ears
for
evidences
that
the
family
were
aroused
heard
the
tap
of
celia
crutches
which
the
invalid
had
just
learned
to
use
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
lanse
door
opened
and
shut
with
a
bang
here
they
come
murmured
charlotte
trying
distractedly
to
hush
the
baby
by
means
which
were
never
known
to
have
that
effect
upon
a
startled
infant
in
a
strange
house
her
door
swung
open
celia
stood
on
the
threshold
her
eyes
wide
with
alarm
lanse
lightly
costumed
in
pajamas
gazed
over
her
shoulder
charlotte
birch
cried
celia
and
words
failed
her
but
lanse
was
ready
of
speech
what
the
dickens
does
this
mean
he
inquired
wrathfully
have
we
become
an
orphanage
i
thought
i
heard
singular
sounds
just
after
i
got
to
bed
is
there
any
good
reason
why
the
family
should
be
informed
of
what
strange
intentions
you
may
have
in
your
brain
before
you
carry
them
out
whose
youngster
is
it
and
what
are
you
doing
with
it
here
charlotte
lips
were
seen
to
move
but
the
baby
fright
had
received
such
an
accession
from
the
appearance
of
two
more
unknown
beings
in
the
room
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
what
charlotte
said
was
please
go
away
i
tell
you
in
the
morning
but
the
visitors
failing
to
catch
the
appeal
not
only
did
not
go
away
but
moved
nearer
why
it
annie
donohue
baby
cried
celia
and
shrieked
the
information
into
lanse
ear
his
expression
of
disfavour
relaxed
a
degree
but
he
still
looked
preternaturally
severe
celia
hobbled
over
to
the
baby
and
sitting
down
in
a
held
out
her
arms
but
charlotte
shook
her
head
and
motioned
imperatively
toward
the
door
at
this
instant
jeff
in
a
red
bathrobe
appeared
in
the
doorway
grasped
the
situation
nodded
assurance
to
charlotte
and
hauled
his
elder
brother
across
the
hall
into
his
own
room
where
he
closed
the
door
and
explained
in
a
few
terse
sentences
annie
died
last
night
we
heard
of
it
late
and
charlotte
thought
she
would
disturb
anybody
the
doctor
was
there
he
carried
the
baby
home
we
could
leave
her
there
she
was
scared
to
death
she
knows
fiddle
and
she
grow
quiet
now
if
you
people
do
stand
round
and
insist
on
explanations
being
roared
at
you
but
we
ca
keep
a
baby
here
began
lanse
who
had
come
home
late
unusually
tired
and
was
feeling
the
customary
masculine
displeasure
at
having
his
rest
broken
a
sensation
which
at
the
moment
took
precedence
over
any
more
humanitarian
emotions
we
do
have
to
settle
that
do
we
demanded
jeff
with
scorn
has
the
poor
girl
got
enough
on
her
hands
without
having
you
scowl
at
her
for
trying
to
do
the
good
samaritan
act
at
three
in
the
morning
jeff
next
turned
his
attention
to
celia
he
went
into
charlotte
room
picked
up
his
elder
sister
without
saying
by
your
leave
and
carried
her
off
to
her
own
bed
but
jeff
i
could
help
charlotte
celia
remonstrated
the
poor
baby
may
be
sick
do
believe
it
she
simply
scared
stiff
at
kimonos
and
pajamas
and
bathrobes
stalking
round
her
in
a
strange
house
charlotte
can
cool
her
down
if
anybody
can
if
she
ca
i
call
the
doctor
now
go
to
sleep
charlotte
and
i
will
man
the
ship
and
in
the
morning
you
can
go
to
work
making
duds
for
the
baby
it
did
have
anything
to
wear
round
it
but
a
summer
cape
and
plaid
shawl
this
artful
allusion
touched
celia
tender
heart
and
set
her
mind
at
work
as
jeff
had
meant
it
should
so
putting
out
her
light
he
slipped
away
to
charlotte
exulting
in
having
so
promptly
fixed
things
for
her
but
charlotte
met
him
with
anxious
eyes
the
baby
was
still
screaming
see
how
she
stiffens
every
now
and
then
and
holds
her
breath
till
i
think
she
never
breathe
again
she
called
in
his
ear
i
do
really
think
you
better
call
fields
you
can
wake
her
with
a
knock
on
her
window
she
sleeps
in
the
little
wing
as
he
hurried
down
the
hall
the
door
of
captain
rayburn
room
opened
and
jeff
met
the
quiet
question
what
up
lad
he
stopped
an
instant
to
explain
encountered
prompt
sympathy
and
laid
a
hasty
injunction
upon
his
uncle
not
to
attempt
to
assist
charlotte
in
her
dilemma
that
gentleman
hobbled
back
to
bed
smiling
tenderly
to
himself
in
the
dark
why
if
he
had
seen
him
jeff
never
would
have
been
able
to
guess
chapter
vii
i
got
a
that
i
know
the
kinks
of
said
fields
to
celia
and
charlotte
and
the
baby
who
regarded
her
with
interest
from
the
couch
where
they
were
grouped
the
doctor
going
to
be
away
all
day
and
if
you
all
come
over
we
can
get
through
a
lot
of
little
clothes
for
the
baby
land
knows
she
ai
anyway
fixed
for
going
outdoors
in
all
kinds
of
weather
the
way
the
doctor
wants
her
to
this
was
so
true
that
it
carried
weight
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
in
the
way
so
before
he
went
off
to
school
on
a
certain
february
morning
jeff
had
carried
celia
across
to
field
and
by
ten
three
busy
people
were
at
work
captain
rayburn
had
begged
to
be
of
the
party
and
although
fields
received
with
skepticism
his
declaration
that
he
could
do
various
sorts
of
sewing
with
a
sufficient
degree
of
skill
she
allowed
him
to
come
on
condition
that
he
look
after
the
baby
well
for
the
land
sake
cried
the
forewoman
of
the
sewing
brigade
as
she
opened
the
big
bundle
captain
rayburn
had
brought
with
him
i
should
say
you
have
left
much
for
us
to
do
the
captain
regarded
with
complacency
the
finished
garments
she
was
holding
up
yes
said
he
i
telephoned
the
big
children
supply
shop
to
send
me
what
miss
ellen
would
need
for
it
seemed
a
pity
to
have
her
stay
in
another
day
waiting
to
be
sewed
up
are
they
right
i
thought
the
making
of
her
indoor
clothes
would
be
enough
celia
and
charlotte
were
exclaiming
with
delight
over
the
pretty
wadded
white
coat
which
fields
held
aloft
there
was
a
little
furry
hood
to
match
mittens
and
a
pair
of
leggings
of
the
sort
desirable
for
small
travellers
if
he
has
remembered
everything
cried
fields
when
this
last
article
of
apparel
came
to
view
well
sir
i
wo
say
you
saved
us
quite
a
chore
i
got
the
little
flannel
petticoats
all
cut
out
doctor
churchill
bought
flannel
enough
to
keep
her
covered
from
now
till
she
five
years
old
talk
about
economy
when
a
man
goes
shopping
fields
plunged
into
business
with
a
will
the
hummed
ceaselessly
celia
with
rapid
skillful
fingers
kept
pace
with
her
in
basting
and
putting
together
and
charlotte
well
charlotte
did
her
best
meanwhile
captain
rayburn
and
the
baby
explored
together
mysterious
realms
of
pockets
and
for
the
land
sake
miss
charlotte
cried
fields
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
if
you
ai
made
five
left
sleeves
and
only
one
right
charlotte
looked
up
crimsoning
how
could
i
have
done
it
easy
enough
field
expression
softened
instantly
at
sight
of
the
girl
dismay
i
done
it
a
good
many
times
something
about
it
sleeves
act
bewitched
they
seem
bound
to
hang
together
and
be
all
one
kind
or
all
the
other
anything
but
pairs
why
do
you
rest
a
little
and
take
baby
outdoors
in
her
new
coat
celia
suggested
sewing
is
such
wearisome
work
if
one
is
used
to
it
so
charlotte
and
her
charge
gladly
went
out
a
neighbour
had
lent
an
old
baby
sled
and
in
it
miss
ellen
donohue
snuggled
to
the
chin
in
the
warmest
of
garments
and
wrappings
took
her
first
airing
since
the
night
a
week
before
when
she
had
been
brought
home
in
doctor
churchill
arms
she
was
a
shy
but
happy
baby
and
had
already
won
all
hearts
nobody
was
willing
to
begin
the
steps
necessary
to
place
her
in
any
of
the
institutions
designed
for
cases
like
hers
charlotte
indeed
would
not
hear
of
it
and
even
the
practical
john
lansing
who
had
learned
to
figure
the
family
finances
pretty
closely
since
he
himself
had
become
the
succumbed
to
the
touch
of
baby
fingers
on
his
face
and
the
glance
of
a
pair
of
eyes
like
as
for
captain
rayburn
he
was
the
baby
devoted
slave
at
all
times
his
most
jealous
rival
being
andrew
churchill
who
was
constantly
inventing
excuses
for
coming
in
for
a
frolic
with
baby
ellen
if
the
doctor
could
look
in
on
us
now
observed
fields
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
charlotte
was
again
bravely
trying
to
distinguish
herself
at
tasks
in
which
she
was
by
no
means
an
adept
he
be
put
out
with
me
for
having
this
party
a
day
when
he
was
away
he
sets
great
store
by
anything
that
looks
like
a
lot
of
people
at
home
is
he
one
of
a
large
family
celia
asked
he
was
two
years
ago
since
then
he
lost
a
brother
and
a
sister
and
his
mother
his
father
died
five
years
ago
he
has
a
married
brother
in
japan
and
an
unmarried
one
in
south
africa
there
ai
anybody
in
the
old
home
now
it
broke
up
when
his
mother
died
two
years
ago
he
got
over
that
not
a
bit
she
was
going
to
come
and
live
with
him
here
it
was
a
town
where
she
used
to
visit
a
good
deal
and
since
he
settle
near
the
old
home
because
it
was
a
good
field
for
young
doctors
she
was
willing
to
come
here
with
him
that
why
he
here
now
though
i
suppose
it
do
begin
to
be
as
advantageous
a
place
for
him
as
it
would
be
in
the
city
itself
he
thought
a
terrible
lot
of
his
mother
andy
did
seems
as
if
he
wanted
to
please
her
now
as
much
as
ever
and
he
has
some
pretty
homesick
times
now
and
then
though
he
does
show
it
much
it
was
the
first
time
the
doctor
housekeeper
had
been
so
communicative
and
her
three
hearers
listened
with
deep
interest
although
they
asked
few
questions
made
only
one
or
two
kindly
comments
and
did
not
express
half
the
sympathy
they
felt
only
captain
rayburn
thoughtfully
staring
out
of
the
window
gave
voice
to
a
sentiment
for
which
both
his
nieces
although
they
said
nothing
in
reply
inwardly
thanked
him
doctor
churchill
is
a
rare
sort
of
fellow
he
said
doctor
forester
considers
him
most
promising
i
know
but
better
than
that
he
is
one
whose
personality
alone
will
always
be
the
strongest
part
of
his
influence
over
his
patients
winning
them
from
despair
to
courage
how
they
ca
tell
and
the
man
who
can
add
to
the
sum
total
of
the
courage
of
the
human
race
has
done
for
it
what
it
very
much
needs
a
few
minutes
after
this
little
speech
the
subject
of
it
quite
unexpectedly
came
dashing
in
bringing
with
him
a
great
breath
of
february
air
he
stopped
in
astonishment
upon
the
threshold
if
this
is
the
unkindest
trick
i
ever
heard
of
he
cried
his
brilliant
eyes
flashing
from
one
to
another
i
suppose
that
of
a

answer

the
captain

just
one
candidate
for
active
service

this
company
unless

doubt

that
fields

doctor
churchill
turned
to
fields
she
glanced
up
into
his
laughing
eyes
run
along
and
do
bother
me
she
said
to
him
take
that
child
there
she
about
got
her
stent
done
i
guess
doctor
churchill
looked
at
the
curly
black
head
bent
closely
over
the
last
of
the
little
sleeves
you
do
deceive
me
miss
charlotte
said
he

wedded
to
that
task
as
you

me
there
time
for
a
magnificent
hour

celia
looked
up
at
him
smiling
but
her
eyes
were
wistful

captain
rayburn
telephone
to
the
stables
for
a
comfortable
old
horse
and
sleigh

i
look
after
ellen
said
fields
before
anybody
could
mention
the
baby

all
of
you
may
we
all
come
back
to
supper
with
you
asked
doctor
churchill
giving
her
a
glance
with
which
she
was
familiar
of
old
if
you
send
for
some
oysters
i
give
you
all
hot
stew
she
said
and
received
such
a
chorus
of
applause
that
she
mentally
added
several
items
to
the
treat
now
i
can
enjoy
my
fun
whispered
charlotte
to
celia
as
she
brought
her
sister
wraps
and
pulled
on
her
own
rough
brown
coat
such
a
jolly
uncle
is
he
the
best
in
the
world
wear
your
white
tam
dear
and
the
white
mittens
they
look
so
well
with
your
brown
suit
tie
the
white
silk
scarf
about
your
neck
that
it
now
run
i
so
afraid
somebody
will
call
the
doctor
out
and
spoil
it
all
charlotte
ran
and
found
the
doctor
waiting
impatiently
two
pairs
of
skates
on
his
arm
he
hurried
her
away
down
the
street
we
must
get
all
there
is
of
this
he
said
i
feel
as
if
i
could
skate
fifty
miles
and
back
again
do
you
indeed
i
do
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
run
round
the
block
between
every
two
stitches
all
day
they
say
the
river
is
good
for
three
miles
up
that
will
give
us
just
what
we
want
a
sensation
of
running
away
from
the
earth
and
all
its
cares
and
when
we
get
back
we
be
ready
for
fieldsy
stew
they
found
everybody
on
the
river
charlotte
was
busy
nodding
to
her
friends
while
the
doctor
put
on
her
skates
in
a
few
moments
the
two
were
flying
up
the
course
oh
this
is
great
exulted
doctor
churchill
and
this
is
the
first
time
you
been
on
the
ice
this
winter
in
february
this
is
fine
enough
to
make
up
i
do
love
it
it
takes
out
all
the
puckers
does
it
i
thought
you
been
cultivating
puckers
the
minute
i
saw
you
or
else
i
interpreted
your
mood
by
my
own
talk
about
puckers
and
nerves
miss
charlotte
i
done
my
first
big
operation
in
a
certain
line
i
mean
in
a
new
line
an
experiment
it
was
a
success
she
looked
up
at
him
her
face
full
of
sympathy
oh
i
so
glad
she
said
are
you
thank
you
i
wanted
somebody
to
be
glad
and
i
had
anybody
i
had
to
tell
you
it
too
soon
to
be
absolutely
sure
but
it
promises
so
well
i
daring
to
be
happy
it
the
sort
of
operation
in
which
the
worst
danger
is
practically
over
if
the
patient
gets
through
the
operation
itself
she
rallied
beautifully
and
whatever
happens
proved
my
point
that
the
experiment
is
feasible
some
of
the
men
doubted
that
all
thought
it
a
big
risk
but
i
had
to
take
it
and
now
ah
come
on
miss
charlotte
let
fly
away
they
went
faster
and
faster
long
swinging
strokes
in
perfect
unison
two
accomplished
skaters
with
one
object
in
view
working
off
healthy
young
spirits
at
a
tension
they
did
not
talk
they
saved
their
breath
they
went
like
the
wind
itself
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
smooth
ice
which
ended
at
a
little
waterfall
they
came
to
a
stop
churchill
looked
down
at
a
face
like
a
rose
black
eyes
that
were
all
alight
and
lips
that
smiled
with
the
fresh
happiness
of
the
fine
sport
i
skated
at
copenhagen
and
at
petersburg
he
said
gaily
to
say
nothing
of
fresh
pond
and
lake
superior
and
other
such
home
grounds
but
it
safe
to
say
i
never
enjoyed
a
mile
of
them
like
that
last
one
you
you
were
really
glad
were
you
that
it
went
so
well
with
me
how
could
i
help
it
doctor
churchill
she
answered
earnestly
ever
since
coming
out
she
had
been
remembering
the
little
revelation
his
housekeeper
had
made
of
his
life
and
it
had
touched
her
deeply
to
know
why
he
had
come
to
settle
in
the
suburban
town
instead
of
in
the
much
more
promising
city
field
a
question
which
had
occurred
to
her
many
times
since
she
had
known
him
i
always
expected
he
went
on
in
a
more
quiet
way
to
be
able
to
come
home
and
tell
my
mother
about
my
first
triumphs
she
would
have
been
so
proud
and
happy
over
the
smallest
thing
her
father
was
a
distinguished
surgeon
marchmont
of
baltimore
he
died
only
four
years
ago
his
books
are
an
authority
on
certain
subjects
my
other
grandfather
was
andrew
churchill
of
glasgow
an
physician
and
a
good
one
so
you
see
i
come
honestly
by
my
love
for
it
all
and
mother
how
we
used
to
talk
it
all
over
he
stopped
abruptly
with
a
tightening
of
the
lips
and
stood
staring
off
over
the
frozen
fields
his
eyes
growing
sombre
charlotte
own
eyes
fell
her
heart
beat
fast
with
sympathy
she
laid
the
lightest
of
touches
on
his
arm
i
know
she
said
softly
fieldsy
told
me
a
little
bit
i
so
sorry
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
down
at
her
his
eyes
searching
her
face
you
a
little
comrade
he
said
and
his
voice
was
low
and
moved
then
with
a
quick
motion
he
seized
her
hands
again
and
they
were
off
back
down
the
river
not
so
fast
as
before
and
silently
the
two
skaters
covered
the
miles
and
only
as
they
came
within
sight
of
the
crowd
of
people
at
the
beginning
of
the
course
did
doctor
churchill
speak
this
has
been
a
fine
hour
has
it
he
said
your
face
looks
as
if
you
had
lost
all
the
puckers
have
you
indeed
i
have
have
you
it
has
done
me
a
world
of
good
i
was
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
now
i
cool
again
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
as
soon
as
supper
is
over
i
shall
stay
all
night
when
you
get
back
said
charlotte
will
you
telephone
me
how
the
case
is
doing
may
i
he
answered
eagerly
of
course
you
may
i
shall
be
anxious
till
i
know
i
have
no
business
to
add
one
smallest
item
of
anxiety
to
your
list
of
worries
he
admitted
but
it
seems
so
good
to
me
to
have
somebody
care
just
now
fieldsy
a
dear
soul
i
could
get
on
without
her
but
never
mind
that
enough
of
andrew
churchill
for
one
afternoon
shall
we
make
a
big
spurt
to
the
finish
let
show
them
what
skating
is
no
little
cutting
of
geometrical
in
a
square
they
drew
in
with
swift
graceful
strokes
threaded
their
course
through
the
crowd
of
skaters
and
were
soon
on
their
way
home
captain
rayburn
and
celia
passed
them
called
back
that
it
was
a
great
day
for
invalids
and
children
and
reached
home
just
in
time
for
the
doctor
to
carry
celia
into
the
little
brick
house
charlotte
ran
to
summon
her
three
brothers
for
it
was
after
six
never
had
an
oyster
stew
such
enthusiastic
praise
not
an
appetite
was
lacking
not
a
spoon
flagged
fields
moved
to
lavish
hospitality
in
which
she
was
upheld
by
the
doctor
produced
a
chicken
pie
which
had
been
originally
intended
for
his
dinner
alone
and
which
she
had
at
first
designed
when
she
proposed
the
oysters
to
keep
over
until
the
morrow
this
was
flanked
by
various
dishes
impromptu
but
delectable
and
followed
by
a
round
of
winter
fruit
and
spongecake
the
latter
the
pride
of
the
housekeeper
heart
and
dear
to
her
master
from
old
association
if
you
live
like
this
all
the
time
doctor
churchill
said
john
lansing
birch
leaning
back
in
his
chair
at
last
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
asks
no
more
of
the
gods
i
advise
you
to
keep
up
a
bachelor
establishment
to
the
end
of
your
days
how
would
that
suit
you
mrs
fields
asked
the
doctor
laughing
fields
from
her
place
at
the
end
of
the
table
they
had
insisted
on
having
her
sit
down
with
them
answered
deliberately
as
long
as
a
man
a
man
i
suppose
nothing
on
earth
ever
will
make
him
feel
so
satisfied
with
himself
and
all
creation
as
being
set
down
in
front
of
a
lot
of
eatables
now
what
gives
me
most
peace
of
mind
is
knowing
that
that
little
ellen
donohue
asleep
on
my
bed
has
got
enough
new
clothes
by
this
day
work
to
make
a
very
good
beginning
of
an
outfit
now
how
do
you
old
bachelors
feel
cried
celia
amidst
laughter
and
the
party
broke
up
at
ten
that
evening
when
charlotte
had
seen
her
sister
comfortably
in
bed
for
celia
still
needed
help
in
undressing
had
tucked
in
just
and
warned
jeff
that
it
was
bedtime
the
rang
lanse
and
captain
rayburn
sat
reading
in
the
where
the
telephone
stood
upon
a
desk
and
lanse
who
was
near
it
moved
lazily
to
answer
it
but
before
he
could
lift
the
receiver
to
his
ear
charlotte
had
run
into
the
room
and
was
taking
it
from
him
murmuring
it
for
me
i
sure
it
is
well
i
could
have
called
you
said
lanse
looking
curiously
at
her
as
with
cheeks
like
poppies
she
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
answered
with
ears
wide
open
although
he
had
again
taken
up
the
magazine
he
had
laid
down
he
listened
to
charlotte
side
of
the
conversation
it
was
brief
and
no
more
remarkable
than
such
performances
are
apt
to
be
but
lanse
easily
appreciated
the
fact
that
it
was
giving
his
sister
immense
satisfaction
hullo
yes
yes
she
called
yes
oh
she
yes
yes
i
so
glad
yes
of
course
you
are
i
glad
thank
you
yes
good
night
charlotte
hung
up
the
receiver
and
swung
round
from
the
desk
her
face
radiant
her
eyes
like
stars
is
she
indeed
interrogated
lanse
lifting
brotherly
penetrating
eyes
to
her
face
engagement
just
announced
when
is
she
to
be
married
i
glad
you
glad
you
might
so
easily
have
been
jealous
charlotte
laughed
a
ripple
of
merriment
which
was
contagious
for
captain
rayburn
smiled
over
the
evening
paper
and
lanse
himself
grinned
cheerfully
mind
telling
us
the
occasion
of
such
heartfelt
joy
he
inquired
but
charlotte
came
up
behind
him
laid
a
warm
velvet
cheek
against
his
for
a
moment
patted
her
uncle
on
the
shoulder
cried
good
night
to
you
gentlemen
dear
and
ran
away
to
bed
chapter
viii
charlotte
let
little
ellen
slide
down
from
her
lap
washed
and
brushed
now
ellen
be
a
good
girl
she
said
as
she
set
about
picking
up
the
various
articles
she
had
been
using
in
the
baby
bath
and
dressing
charlotte
in
a
hurry
the
rang
celia
was
in
the
kitchen
stirring
up
a
pudding
it
was
april
now
and
celia
knee
was
so
far
mended
that
she
could
be
about
the
house
without
her
crutches
with
certain
restrictions
as
to
standing
or
using
the
knee
in
any
way
likely
to
strain
it
it
was
charlotte
who
did
the
running
about
and
it
was
she
who
started
for
the
door
now
after
casting
one
hasty
look
around
the
to
make
sure
that
the
baby
could
do
herself
no
harm
left
to
herself
ellen
investigated
the
resources
of
the
and
found
them
wanting
after
she
had
thrown
two
towels
the
soap
and
her
own
small
tooth
brush
back
into
the
tub
from
which
she
had
lately
emerged
and
which
charlotte
had
not
yet
emptied
she
found
her
means
of
entertainment
at
an
end
the
other
toilet
articles
were
all
beyond
her
reach
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
there
was
nothing
moving
to
be
seen
but
a
row
of
fields
waving
in
the
wind
she
turned
to
the
door
charlotte
had
meant
to
latch
it
but
it
was
a
door
with
a
peculiar
trick
of
swinging
slowly
open
an
inch
after
it
had
apparently
been
closed
and
it
had
not
been
latched
ellen
pushed
one
small
hand
into
the
crack
and
pulled
it
open
charlotte
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
or
heard
across
the
hall
was
the
door
of
her
room
ajar
and
since
doors
ajar
have
somehow
a
singular
charm
for
babies
this
one
crossed
to
it
and
swung
it
wide
here
was
richness
this
was
charlotte
workshop
she
slept
in
a
smaller
room
adjoining
the
baby
in
the
crib
by
her
side
and
with
that
smaller
room
little
ellen
was
familiar
but
not
with
this
the
tiny
feet
travelled
eagerly
about
from
one
desirable
object
to
another
and
presently
she
remembered
the
big
there
was
nothing
ellen
liked
so
well
as
to
throw
things
into
that
tub
and
see
them
splash
two
books
crossed
the
hall
and
made
the
plunge
one
after
the
other
into
the
soapy
water
ellen
gurgled
with
delight
two
more
journeys
deposited
a
shoe
a
and
a
small
box
contents
unknown
in
the
watery
receptacle
then
ellen
made
a
discovery
which
filled
her
small
soul
with
joy
just
two
days
before
charlotte
had
completed
the
set
of
colour
drawings
which
delineated
the
wall
decoration
of
four
rooms
a
den
a
and
two
bedrooms
they
represented
the
work
of
the
winter
pursued
under
the
exceeding
difficulties
of
managing
a
household
and
for
the
last
three
months
caring
in
part
for
a
little
child
but
charlotte
had
toiled
faithfully
with
the
ardour
of
one
who
having
only
a
small
portion
of
time
to
give
to
a
beloved
pursuit
works
at
it
all
the
more
zealously
and
she
had
gone
on
from
one
room
to
another
in
her
designing
with
the
hope
that
if
in
one
she
failed
to
please
those
upon
whom
her
success
depended
some
one
of
the
series
might
appeal
to
them
and
give
her
the
desired
place
in
their
interest
it
was
her
intention
on
this
very
day
after
luncheon
should
be
over
and
she
should
be
free
for
a
few
hours
to
make
the
visit
to
the
great
manufacturing
house
where
she
was
to
show
her
wares
the
drawings
lay
in
a
pile
upon
charlotte
table
ready
to
be
wrapped
baby
ellen
spying
the
pile
of
drawings
with
an
edge
or
two
of
brilliant
colour
showing
trotted
gaily
over
to
the
table
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
pulled
at
the
corner
nearest
her
the
drawings
fell
from
the
table
in
a
disordered
heap
on
the
floor
the
sight
of
them
pleased
ellen
immensely
she
held
one
up
and
shook
it
in
her
small
fists
slowly
and
carefully
tore
a
corner
off
it
and
cast
the
sheet
down
in
favour
of
the
next
in
order
this
she
tore
cleanly
in
two
in
the
middle
the
paper
was
tough
to
be
sure
but
the
little
fists
were
strong
then
she
remembered
that
seductive
a
patter
of
little
feet
a
laugh
of
pleasure
da
cried
ellen
gleefully
the
first
sheet
was
in
seven
trips
pursued
with
vigour
and
growing
hilarity
and
work
had
received
its
initial
plunge
into
a
new
state
of
being
four
of
the
drawings
had
been
torn
in
two
the
was
a
mass
of
softly
blending
colours
charlotte
came
running
back
up
the
stairs
her
mind
which
had
been
held
captive
by
a
young
caller
reverting
with
some
anxiety
to
the
small
person
whom
she
had
left
as
she
thought
shut
up
in
the
safe
she
expected
to
hear
ellen
crying
as
was
likely
to
be
the
case
when
left
alone
without
sufficient
means
of
amusement
but
the
silence
as
she
flew
alarmed
her
silence
was
almost
sure
to
mean
mischief
the
door
was
ajar
charlotte
pushed
it
open
and
looked
in
one
glance
showed
her
he
havoc
which
had
been
wrought
she
stopped
short
staring
with
wild
eyes
into
the
then
she
caught
her
treasures
out
of
it
held
them
dripping
before
her
for
an
instant
and
let
them
drop
on
the
floor
she
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
room
to
look
for
ellen
the
baby
sat
calmly
on
a
rug
in
the
middle
of
charlotte
room
engaged
in
pulling
the
leaves
one
by
one
out
of
a
small
which
had
been
on
the
table
with
the
drawings
she
looked
up
a
most
engaging
and
innocent
expression
on
her
round
face
and
smiled
at
charlotte
but
she
met
no
smile
in
return
you
little
wretch
breathed
charlotte
between
her
teeth
as
she
seized
the
and
whirled
the
baby
to
her
feet
is
this
the
way
you
pay
me
for
all
i
done
for
you
you
cruel
it
was
the
explosion
of
a
blind
wrath
which
made
the
girl
shake
the
tiny
form
until
baby
ellen
roared
lustily
charlotte
set
her
upon
the
floor
again
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
with
blazing
eyes
the
small
head
was
clasped
in
two
little
fists
as
the
child
tore
at
her
yellow
curls
her
infant
soul
stirred
to
indignation
and
fright
at
this
most
unexpected
treatment
suddenly
charlotte
seized
her
again
and
bore
her
swiftly
away
to
captain
rayburn
room
take
care
of
her
for
an
hour
surely
but
what
the
matter
it
was
small
wonder
he
asked
for
charlotte
face
was
white
her
eyes
brilliant
and
her
lips
quivering
as
she
spoke
it
nothing
only
baby
has
spoiled
something
of
mine
and
i
so
angry
i
do
dare
trust
myself
with
her
she
dropped
little
ellen
in
his
arms
and
fled
leaving
her
uncle
to
think
what
he
might
he
looked
grave
as
he
soothed
the
baby
whose
small
breast
still
heaved
convulsively
are
you
conscientiously
trying
to
do
your
full
share
in
developing
our
little
second
fiddle
capacity
to
play
first
he
asked
the
baby
with
his
face
against
hers
never
mind
little
one
never
mind
baby
know
but
john
rayburn
does
that
this
being
a
means
of
education
to
other
people
is
a
thankless
task
sometimes
do
cry
aunty
charlotte
will
kiss
her
hard
and
fast
by
and
by
to
make
up
for
losing
her
temper
with
the
little
maid
i
suspect
you
were
very
very
trying
to
make
aunty
charlotte
look
like
that
charlotte
came
after
a
time
and
attended
to
the
luncheon
her
lips
pressed
tight
together
her
eyes
heavy
although
not
with
tears
she
would
not
let
herself
cry
celia
had
a
headache
and
did
not
notice
being
herself
disinclined
to
talk
and
captain
rayburn
forbore
to
look
at
charlotte
but
jeff
when
he
came
in
observed
at
once
that
something
was
amiss
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
he
drew
charlotte
into
a
corner
you
have
been
to
murdock
with
the
pictures
and
been
turned
down
he
asked
no
going
this
afternoon
are
you
no
why
not
thought
that
was
the
plan
charlotte
turned
away
fighting
hard
for
jeff
caught
her
arm
see
here
fiddle
you
got
to
tell
me
you
look
like
a
ghost
no
bad
news
from
new
mexico
oh
no
no
please
go
away
i
wo
till
you
tell
me
what
up
you
not
sick
charlotte
ran
off
jeff
following
charlotte
he
cried
as
he
pursued
her
into
her
room
before
she
could
turn
and
close
the
door
what
the
use
of
acting
like
this
something
happened
and
i
going
to
know
what
it
is
charlotte
sat
down
in
a
despairing
heap
on
the
floor
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
jeff
glanced
helplessly
from
her
to
the
table
in
the
corner
then
he
observed
that
it
was
bare
of
the
pile
of
drawings
nothing
happened
to
the
he
asked
eagerly
charlotte
nodded
what
go
look
up
in
the
attic
if
you
must
know
jeff
dashed
and
surveyed
the
havoc
he
came
back
breathless
with
dismay
how
did
it
happen
baby
the
little
are
they
spoiled
you
saw
yes
colours
run
together
a
bit
on
some
others
torn
in
two
yet
they
show
what
they
were
fiddle
i
vow
they
do
i
take
them
just
as
they
are
explain
the
whole
thing
and
see
what
comes
of
it
charlotte
raised
her
head
to
shake
it
vigorously
offer
work
in
such
shape
as
that
i
not
such
a
goose
got
to
do
them
all
over
her
head
sank
again
if
i
can
get
the
courage
of
course
you
can
declared
jeff
more
cheerfully
you
never
lack
pluck
poor
girl
i
mighty
sorry
though
it
simply
tough
to
have
it
happen
at
the
last
minute
you
all
tired
out
too
i
know
you
are
you
ought
never
to
have
to
do
it
all
over
again
if
i
could
just
have
shown
them
to
murdock
said
charlotte
heavily
and
have
found
out
that
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
they
would
like
it
would
seem
so
hard
to
do
them
all
over
again
but
to
work
for
weeks
more
and
then
perhaps
have
it
a
failure
after
all
i
know
well
i
got
to
be
off
or
i
be
late
exams
this
week
cheer
up
fiddle
maybe
you
can
fix
up
easier
than
you
think
late
in
the
afternoon
charlotte
came
to
her
uncle
for
the
baby
he
had
cared
for
her
all
day
she
safe
with
you
now
he
asked
with
a
keen
look
up
into
her
quiet
face
i
hope
so
charlotte
cheek
was
against
the
little
head
she
held
the
baby
tenderly
when
she
is
in
bed
will
you
come
and
tell
me
what
she
did
charlotte
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
she
was
to
blame
i
left
her
alone
for
ten
minutes
but
i
should
like
to
know
about
it
he
said
coaxingly
i
have
had
rather
a
busy
day
with
why
not
reward
me
with
your
confidence
but
she
would
not
promise
neither
did
she
come
this
was
exceedingly
characteristic
of
the
girl
but
captain
rayburn
his
sharp
eyes
observing
in
her
aspect
the
signs
of
misery
in
spite
of
a
brave
attempt
to
seem
cheerful
made
up
his
mind
to
find
out
for
himself
twice
he
encountered
her
coming
down
from
the
attic
and
each
time
she
avoided
speaking
to
him
that
night
after
everybody
was
in
bed
captain
rayburn
his
canes
held
under
his
arm
crept
slowly
a
little
electric
candle
of
his
own
in
his
pocket
by
means
of
this
he
soon
discovered
ruined
work
which
she
had
not
yet
found
heart
to
remove
from
the
place
where
she
had
first
laid
it
trusting
to
the
privacy
of
a
place
which
was
seldom
invaded
by
anybody
he
sat
down
on
a
convenient
box
and
studied
the
coloured
plates
and
sketches
as
he
looked
his
lips
drew
into
a
whistle
of
surprise
and
admiration
followed
by
a
long
breath
of
pity
for
what
he
was
sure
he
understood
jeff
having
just
dropped
off
into
the
sound
sleep
of
the
healthy
boy
found
himself
gently
punched
into
wakefulness
come
to
jeff
and
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
said
captain
rayburn
smiling
at
his
nephew
in
the
dim
white
light
from
the
candle
jeff
raised
himself
on
his
pillow
up
he
grunted
blinking
like
an
owl
nothing
serious
what
was
charlotte
going
to
do
with
her
colour
drawings
show
them
to
some
manufacturers
what
er
yes
no
what
do
you
know
about
it
jeff
was
up
on
his
elbow
now
staring
at
his
uncle
all
about
it
except
that
charlotte
tell
you
i
did
think
she
she
did
i
guessed
and
found
out
you
may
as
well
tell
me
the
rest
is
it
a
shame
poor
girl
worked
months
on
those
things
just
got
done
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
they
were
great
i
told
her
she
could
take
them
as
they
were
but
she
would
hear
of
it
but
where
were
they
going
to
murdock
at
chrystler
company
office
he
saw
something
of
charlotte
once
by
chance
through
a
niece
of
his
who
friend
and
he
sent
word
to
fiddle
that
she
ought
to
cultivate
that
colour
sense
or
whatever
it
was
i
forget
what
he
called
it
for
she
had
it
to
an
unusual
degree
charlotte
has
cultivated
it
for
two
years
since
then
and
now
oh
confound
that
baby
that
what
you
get
for
trying
to
be
a
missionary
i
wish
we
sent
her
to
an
orphanage
right
off
what
the
use
you
do
feel
that
are
the
uses
of
adversity
sometimes
they
are
though
son
the
little
second
violin
has
given
in
and
wailed
about
it
i
saw
no
traces
of
tears
no
you
right
you
have
agreed
jeff
proudly
she
not
that
sort
she
all
broken
up
though
inside
and
i
do
blame
her
no
jeff
it
saturday
is
it
you
must
get
those
drawings
early
in
the
morning
while
charlotte
is
busy
with
her
saturday
baking
we
have
a
livery
outfit
and
you
shall
drive
me
down
to
chrystler
uncle
ray
you
a
trump
it
just
what
i
said
should
be
done
the
work
shows
perfectly
well
what
she
intended
and
if
a
chap
like
you
explains
it
captain
rayburn
limped
away
laughing
his
hand
red
with
the
tremendous
grip
his
nephew
had
just
given
it
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
see
the
way
the
boy
invariably
stood
by
his
sister
it
was
a
characteristic
of
the
birch
family
as
a
whole
which
it
may
be
said
was
worth
more
both
to
themselves
and
to
the
world
at
large
than
the
possession
of
almost
any
other
trait
it
was
not
until
dinner
was
over
that
captain
rayburn
and
his
nephew
returned
begging
pardon
for
their
tardiness
and
explaining
that
they
had
taken
luncheon
in
the
city
fiddle
jeff
said
with
a
face
of
preternatural
gravity
come
up
to
uncle
ray
room
when
the
dishes
are
done
will
you
he
vanished
before
his
sister
could
ask
why
and
before
she
could
see
the
grin
which
overspread
his
ruddy
countenance
as
he
turned
away
but
something
he
could
not
keep
out
of
his
voice
roused
her
curiosity
and
she
made
quick
work
of
the
dishes
come
in
come
in
invited
captain
rayburn
and
jeff
rose
from
the
couch
where
his
nose
had
been
buried
among
some
of
his
periodicals
there
were
always
books
and
magazines
by
the
score
wherever
captain
rayburn
settled
himself
for
any
length
of
time
the
and
the
schoolboy
eyed
each
other
doubtfully
for
an
instant
as
charlotte
dropped
into
a
chair
her
usually
bright
face
was
still
very
sober
and
her
eyelashes
swept
her
cheek
as
she
waited
captain
rayburn
nodded
at
jeff
the
boy
stood
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
pushed
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
pulled
them
out
again
cleared
his
throat
laughed
nervously
and
strode
suddenly
across
the
room
to
his
sister
he
thrust
out
his
hand
as
he
came
to
a
halt
before
her
congratulations
to
the
distinguished
decorator
he
cried
and
came
to
the
end
temporarily
of
his
eloquence
charlotte
looked
up
in
amazement
jeff
seized
her
hand
and
pumped
it
up
and
down
she
glanced
in
bewilderment
at
her
uncle
and
met
his
smile
of
encouragement
mine
too
he
said
what
she
began
and
her
voice
stuck
in
her
throat
her
heart
began
to
thump
wildly
then
jeff
told
it
all
in
one
burst
uncle
ray
found
your
stuff
in
the
attic
thought
it
great
woke
me
up
and
ground
it
out
of
me
what
you
meant
to
do
with
it
he
was
sure
as
i
was
it
was
fit
to
show
and
you
ought
not
to
do
it
all
over
first
got
a
horse
drove
into
chrystler
saw
murdock
he
would
look
at
anything
listened
to
the
story
about
the
baby
looked
at
the
stuff
face
changed
did
it
uncle
ray
from
politeness
to
interest
and
all
the
rest
of
it
said
the
work
had
faults
of
course
you
expected
that
fiddle
but
it
showed
promise
promise
that
just
what
he
said
he
wants
to
see
everything
you
do
he
wants
you
to
come
and
see
him
he
thinks
he
can
use
at
least
two
of
your
rooms
after
you
made
them
over
oh
he
was
great
you
done
it
fiddle
you
done
it
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
way
his
sister
took
the
good
news
she
sat
looking
solemnly
at
him
for
a
minute
then
she
jumped
up
turned
toward
captain
rayburn
with
a
face
on
fire
with
conflicting
and
uncontrollable
emotions
then
whirled
about
and
was
out
of
the
room
like
a
flash
well
if
i
ever
declared
jeff
in
intense
displeasure
staring
at
his
uncle
but
captain
rayburn
face
was
the
picture
of
satisfaction
it
all
right
jeff
said
his
uncle
you
never
can
tell
what
a
woman
will
do
but
you
can
count
on
one
thing
it
wo
be
what
you
expect
you
do
suppose
she
was
angry
do
you
the
captain
smiled
no
i
do
think
she
was
angry
he
said
confidently
the
door
flew
open
again
two
impetuous
arms
were
around
jeff
neck
from
behind
nearly
strangling
him
a
breezy
swirl
of
skirts
and
captain
rayburn
feared
for
the
integrity
of
his
head
upon
his
shoulders
and
then
the
two
were
alone
again
christopher
columbus
discovered
america
in
ejaculated
jefferson
an
expression
of
great
delight
irradiating
his
countenance
then
he
looked
at
his
uncle
with
an
air
of
superior
wisdom
she
cry
he
said
i
should
wonder
if
she
did
agreed
the
captain
nodding
chapter
ix
lanse
stood
in
the
kitchen
door
in
hand
it
lacked
ten
minutes
of
seven
of
a
june
morning
therefore
he
wore
his
working
clothes
he
glanced
down
at
them
now
with
an
expression
of
extreme
distaste
then
from
celia
to
charlotte
both
of
whom
wore
fresh
print
dresses
covered
with
the
trim
pinafore
aprons
which
were
celia
pride
when
this
siege
is
over
he
remarked
maybe
i
wo
appreciate
the
privilege
of
wearing
clean
linen
from
morning
till
night
every
day
in
the
week
poor
old
lanse
said
celia
with
compassion
that
been
the
part
that
has
tried
your
soul
has
it
you
have
minded
the
work
but
the
dirt
i
hope
i
not
a
nancy
either
lanse
went
on
i
sure
i
do
feel
that
my
wonderful
dignity
is
compromised
by
my
occupation
better
men
than
i
soil
their
hands
to
more
purpose
every
day
but
well
i
must
be
off
he
departed
abruptly
leaving
celia
standing
in
the
door
to
wave
a
hand
to
him
as
he
turned
the
corner
john
lansing
is
tired
she
said
to
charlotte
sisterly
sympathy
in
her
voice
i
do
think
we
half
appreciated
what
all
these
months
in
the
shops
have
meant
to
him
it
is
as
if
he
were
training
for
one
of
the
engineering
specialties
and
were
interested
in
his
work
as
practical
education
in
his
own
line
he
never
have
the
least
use
for
anything
he
learning
now
he
may
charlotte
suggested
he
may
marry
a
girl
who
will
want
him
to
do
odd
jobs
about
the
house
a
mechanic
in
the
family
is
an
awfully
desirable
thing
fields
says
there
nothing
doctor
churchill
do
in
the
way
of
repairing
and
when
i
told
that
to
uncle
ray
he
said
that
all
good
surgeons
needed
to
be
born
mechanics
and
usually
were
and
even
though
lanse
makes
a
lawyer
like
father
he
may
need
to
get
out
of
the
automobile
he
have
some
day
and
crawl
under
it
and
make
it
over
inside
before
he
can
go
on
celia
laughed
and
went
to
call
the
rest
of
the
family
from
their
beds
early
hours
having
now
perforce
become
the
habit
of
the
birch
family
it
was
some
three
hours
later
that
charlotte
sat
down
for
a
moment
to
rest
on
the
little
back
porch
the
breakfast
work
and
the
were
over
the
kitchen
was
in
order
and
there
was
time
to
draw
breath
before
plunging
into
the
next
set
of
duties
celia
had
gone
to
some
summer
sewing
she
had
on
hand
captain
rayburn
had
taken
the
baby
around
the
corner
to
a
pretty
park
where
the
two
spent
long
hours
now
in
the
perfect
june
weather
the
boys
were
at
school
and
the
house
was
very
still
charlotte
stretched
her
arms
above
her
head
drawing
a
long
breath
how
long
ago
it
seems
that
i
was
free
after
breakfast
to
do
what
i
wanted
to
she
said
to
herself
and
how
little
i
realised
all
the
cares
that
were
always
on
mother
oh
if
it
were
only
time
for
them
to
come
back
this
day
this
hour
this
minute
i
would
mind
the
work
now
if
they
were
only
here
the
girl
gaze
fixed
wistfully
on
the
leafy
treetops
above
her
suddenly
dropped
to
earth
a
man
figure
was
stumbling
along
the
little
path
which
led
diagonally
from
the
back
of
the
birch
premises
through
a
gateway
and
off
toward
a
back
street
the
route
by
which
lanse
was
accustomed
to
take
an
inconspicuous
short
cut
toward
the
locomotive
shops
by
the
river
for
an
instant
only
the
similarity
of
the
figure
to
lanse
struck
her
for
the
wavering
walk
and
bandaged
head
with
hand
pressed
to
the
forehead
did
not
suggest
her
brother
at
the
next
instant
the
man
lifted
a
white
face
and
charlotte
gave
a
startled
cry
as
she
saw
that
it
was
john
lansing
himself
in
a
sorry
plight
she
ran
to
him
his
head
was
clumsily
tied
up
in
a
soiled
cloth
which
the
blood
was
beginning
to
stain
as
she
put
her
arm
about
him
he
smiled
wanly
down
at
her
murmuring
thought
i
could
make
it
glad
i
have
no
not
the
house
doctor
office
do
want
to
scare
celia
nothing
it
might
be
nothing
but
he
was
leaning
heavily
on
his
sister
strong
young
shoulder
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
of
doctor
little
office
charlotte
having
flung
open
the
door
without
waiting
to
ring
nobody
was
there
no
do
try
to
sit
up
in
a
chair
here
lie
down
on
the
couch
she
insisted
and
lanse
yielded
none
too
soon
his
face
had
lost
all
colour
by
the
time
he
had
stretched
his
tall
form
on
the
wide
leather
couch
which
stood
ready
for
just
such
occupants
charlotte
went
back
to
the
door
and
rang
the
bell
then
as
nobody
appeared
she
explored
the
lower
part
of
the
house
for
fields
in
vain
returning
she
caught
sight
for
the
first
time
of
a
little
memorandum
on
the
doctor
desk
return
she
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
exactly
quarter
past
ten
she
studied
her
brother
face
anxiously
the
stain
upon
the
cloth
was
rapidly
growing
larger
she
was
sure
he
ought
not
to
lie
there
with
the
bleeding
unchecked
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
small
private
office
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
package
labeled
absorbent
cotton
she
opened
it
pulled
out
a
handful
and
went
back
to
her
brother
she
lifted
the
cloth
from
his
head
and
saw
a
long
uneven
gash
from
which
the
blood
was
freely
oozing
taking
two
rolls
of
cotton
she
laid
one
on
each
side
of
the
wound
forcing
the
edges
together
after
a
little
experimenting
she
found
that
by
holding
her
cotton
very
firmly
and
pressing
in
a
certain
way
the
flow
of
the
blood
was
almost
completely
checked
does
that
hurt
she
asked
lanse
he
nodded
without
speaking
but
she
did
not
lighten
her
pressure
she
saw
that
he
was
very
faint
i
sorry
it
hurts
you
dear
she
said
but
it
stops
the
blood
when
i
press
this
way
and
i
sure
that
better
for
you
the
doctor
will
be
here
soon
and
i
think
i
better
hold
it
till
he
comes
lanse
nodded
again
his
brows
contracting
with
pain
not
only
from
the
pressure
upon
the
wound
but
from
the
reaction
from
the
blow
which
had
caused
it
charlotte
eyes
watched
the
clock
her
hands
never
relinquishing
their
task
what
next
she
was
thinking
will
the
time
ever
be
up
and
father
and
mother
come
back
to
find
us
all
safe
three
more
months
three
more
months
andrew
churchill
came
whistling
softly
across
the
lawn
glancing
at
his
watch
and
noting
that
he
was
fifteen
minutes
later
than
he
had
expected
to
be
in
the
doorway
of
his
office
he
came
to
a
surprised
halt
miss
charlotte
what
happened
lanse
spoke
faintly
for
himself
got
hit
at
the
shop
wrench
slipped
out
of
man
hands
above
me
nothing
much
no
i
see
the
doctor
answered
surveying
the
situation
he
lifted
charlotte
cotton
rolls
noted
the
character
and
extent
of
the
injury
and
lost
no
time
in
getting
at
work
keep
up
that
pressure
just
as
you
were
doing
please
miss
charlotte
while
i
make
things
ready
we
have
you
all
right
in
a
jiffy
birch
two
minutes
later
the
doctor
had
lanse
stretched
on
a
narrow
white
table
in
an
inner
office
i
got
to
hurt
you
quite
a
bit
he
said
to
his
patient
i
do
want
to
give
you
an
anesthetic
but
somebody
must
hold
your
head
shall
i
call
mrs
fields
he
glanced
at
charlotte
and
met
what
he
had
counted
on
her
help
no
i
can
manage
she
said
quietly
the
doctor
was
soon
ready
with
arms
surgically
clean
bared
to
the
elbows
it
was
rather
a
bad
ten
minutes
for
lanse
that
followed
although
he
bore
it
bravely
without
a
sound
the
strong
steady
support
of
his
sister
hands
on
the
sides
of
his
head
never
varied
and
her
eyes
watched
the
doctor
rapid
movements
with
absorbed
attention
doctor
churchill
glanced
at
her
two
or
three
times
but
met
only
quiet
resolve
in
her
face
which
although
pale
showed
no
sign
of
weakness
the
injury
was
a
severe
one
being
no
clean
cut
but
a
jagged
gash
several
inches
in
length
caused
by
a
heavy
blow
with
a
rough
tool
charlotte
observed
that
the
worker
seemed
never
at
a
loss
what
to
do
that
his
touch
was
as
light
as
it
was
practised
and
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
keen
interest
in
his
work
at
length
doctor
churchill
finished
his
manipulations
and
put
on
the
smooth
bandages
which
he
remarked
with
a
laugh
were
to
turn
lanse
into
the
image
of
the
terrible
turk
you
show
all
the
spartan
attributes
of
the
real
martyr
declared
the
doctor
as
he
helped
his
patient
back
to
a
couch
it
took
pluck
to
get
home
here
alone
how
was
it
they
sent
no
man
with
you
everybody
busy
a
man
was
coming
with
me
if
i
let
him
but
i
care
for
his
company
so
i
slipped
out
it
was
farther
home
than
i
thought
lanse
explained
how
long
will
this
lay
me
up
i
can
go
back
ca
i
suppose
we
say
the
day
after
that
hammock
on
your
front
porch
behind
the
vines
strikes
me
as
a
restful
place
for
you
a
bit
of
vacation
hurt
you
by
afternoon
the
ache
in
john
lansing
head
had
reached
a
point
where
he
gladly
lay
quietly
in
the
hammock
and
submitted
to
be
waited
on
by
two
devoted
feminine
slaves
the
doctor
came
over
to
see
him
after
supper
and
found
him
in
a
high
state
of
restlessness
he
got
him
to
bed
stayed
with
him
until
he
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
then
left
him
in
charge
of
celia
and
came
so
quietly
down
to
the
front
porch
again
that
he
startled
charlotte
who
lay
in
the
hammock
lanse
had
lately
quitted
do
you
need
me
she
asked
eagerly
i
thought
lanse
would
rather
have
celia
with
him
and
i
was
sure
she
wanted
to
take
care
of
him
so
i
stayed
but
i
ready
if
i
wanted
you
wanted
returned
doctor
churchill
gently
but
not
just
now
lie
still
in
that
hammock
let
me
fix
the
pillows
a
bit
yes
do
please
do
you
know
it
positively
the
first
time
i
seen
you
appearing
to
rest
since
i
known
you
why
doctor
churchill
it
absolutely
so
you
growing
thin
under
the
cares
you
assumed
and
i
suspect
besides
the
cares
you
keep
yourself
busy
when
you
ought
to
be
resting
am
i
right
charlotte
coloured
in
the
twilight
of
the
porch
which
the
thick
vines
of
the
wisteria
screened
from
the
electric
light
on
the
corner
except
for
a
few
feet
at
the
end
nearest
the
door
she
had
been
working
harder
than
ever
all
the
spring
over
her
designs
for
chrystler
company
and
her
cheeks
were
of
a
truth
somewhat
less
round
and
her
colour
less
vivid
of
hue
she
was
tired
although
she
had
not
owned
it
even
to
herself
you
see
doctor
churchill
she
said
slowly
until
father
and
mother
went
away
i
had
been
the
lazy
one
of
the
family
the
the
drone
and
i
not
yet
learned
to
work
in
the
quiet
way
my
sister
does
which
accomplishes
so
much
without
any
fuss
now
that
she
can
get
about
again
she
does
twice
as
much
as
i
do
but
she
does
make
such
a
clatter
of
tools
and
does
get
the
credit
for
being
as
busy
as
i
i
see
of
course
i
had
a
feeling
all
along
that
this
and
and
were
mere
pretense
and
i
relieved
to
have
you
own
up
to
it
charlotte
laughed
after
all
one
does
like
to
be
taken
at
one
own
estimate
she
admitted
i
confess
i
feel
a
pang
to
have
you
agree
with
me
even
in
jest
do
you
know
he
said
abruptly
after
an
instant
silence
you
gave
me
great
pleasure
this
morning
i
how
by
the
way
you
stood
by
your
brother
oh
said
charlotte
astonished
but
i
did
do
anything
nothing
at
all
except
keep
cool
and
hold
steady
those
are
the
hardest
things
a
surgeon
can
set
a
novice
at
you
know
but
you
needed
me
and
fields
was
out
you
did
know
that
but
i
did
and
i
do
think
i
one
of
the
kind
no
you
can
stand
fire
i
think
sometimes
do
you
know
what
i
think
charlotte
waited
her
cheeks
warm
in
the
darkness
praise
is
always
sweet
when
one
has
earned
it
i
believe
you
would
stand
by
a
friend
to
the
last
ditch
charlotte
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
she
answered
low
and
honestly
if
he
were
a
friend
at
all
worth
having
i
should
try
and
expect
the
same
loyalty
in
return
indeed
i
should
i
should
like
said
doctor
churchill
steady
voice
to
try
a
friendship
like
that
an
acknowledged
one
i
always
was
a
fellow
who
liked
things
definite
i
do
like
to
say
to
myself
think
that
man
is
my
friend
i
sure
he
is
he
shows
it
no
i
want
him
to
say
so
to
shake
hands
on
it
i
had
such
a
friend
once
the
only
one
when
he
died
i
felt
i
had
lost
i
ca
tell
you
what
miss
charlotte
i
never
had
another
there
was
a
long
silence
this
time
the
figure
in
the
hammock
lay
still
but
charlotte
heart
was
beating
hard
she
knew
already
that
doctor
churchill
was
the
warm
friend
of
the
family
could
he
mean
to
single
her
out
as
the
special
object
of
his
regard
her
charlotte
when
people
like
lanse
and
celia
were
within
reach
charlotte
rose
to
her
feet
the
doctor
rising
with
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
he
could
see
that
she
was
looking
steadily
up
at
him
he
gazed
back
at
her
and
a
bright
smile
broke
over
his
face
do
you
mean
it
he
said
eagerly
oh
thank
you
he
grasped
the
firm
young
hand
as
charlotte
fancied
he
might
have
grasped
that
of
the
comrade
he
had
lost
ca
we
take
a
little
walk
in
this
glorious
moonlight
he
asked
happily
just
up
and
down
the
block
once
or
twice
or
are
you
too
tired
charlotte
was
not
too
tired
her
weariness
had
vanished
as
if
by
magic
the
two
strolled
slowly
up
and
down
the
quiet
street
talking
earnestly
the
doctor
told
his
companion
about
several
interesting
cases
he
had
among
the
children
and
of
one
little
crippled
boy
upon
whom
he
had
recently
operated
the
girl
listened
with
an
unaffected
interest
and
sympathy
very
grateful
to
the
man
who
had
long
missed
companionship
of
that
sort
an
hour
went
by
as
if
on
wings
celia
came
to
the
door
as
the
two
young
people
were
saying
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
doctor
looked
up
at
her
with
a
smile
is
the
patient
quiet
he
asked
yes
only
he
mutters
in
his
sleep
that
not
strange
he
bound
to
be
a
bit
feverish
after
that
blow
but
i
do
anticipate
serious
trouble
let
jeff
sleep
on
the
couch
in
his
room
that
will
be
all
that
necessary
celia
stood
looking
down
at
the
doctor
as
her
sister
came
up
the
steps
it
strange
she
said
for
i
know
lanse
is
badly
hurt
but
all
i
can
think
of
is
how
i
wish
father
and
mother
were
here
that
been
in
my
head
all
day
said
charlotte
with
her
arm
around
celia
shoulder
i
can
understand
doctor
churchill
answered
them
both
and
they
knew
he
could
but
just
remember
that
though
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
to
stay
for
years
they
can
still
come
back
to
you
just
to
know
that
seems
to
me
enough
they
understood
him
celia
would
have
made
answer
but
at
that
instant
the
sound
of
heavy
rapidly
rounding
the
corner
and
coming
toward
them
made
all
three
turn
to
look
the
carriage
came
on
at
a
great
pace
swerved
toward
them
and
drew
in
to
the
curb
the
driver
pulling
in
his
horses
at
their
door
who
can
it
be
breathed
celia
nobody
has
written
it
must
be
a
mistake
charlotte
gasped
it
could
be
celia
it
be
the
driver
leaped
from
the
box
and
flung
open
the
door
a
tall
figure
stepped
out
turned
toward
them
as
if
trying
to
make
sure
who
they
were
then
waved
its
arm
the
familiar
gesture
brought
two
cries
of
rapture
as
charlotte
rushed
and
celia
hurried
down
the
steps
the
doctor
stood
still
and
watched
his
pulse
quickening
in
sympathy
he
saw
the
tall
figure
grasp
in
turn
both
the
slender
ones
heard
two
eager
cries
of
and
beheld
the
second
occupant
of
the
carriage
fairly
dragged
out
to
be
smothered
in
two
pairs
of
impetuous
young
arms
then
he
went
quietly
away
over
the
lawn
to
his
own
house
feeling
that
he
had
as
yet
no
right
to
be
one
of
the
group
about
the
in
his
room
an
hour
later
he
stood
before
the
portrait
of
a
woman
no
longer
young
but
beautiful
with
the
beauty
which
never
grows
old
he
stood
looking
up
at
it
then
spoke
gently
to
it
she
just
your
sort
dear
he
said
his
keen
eyes
soft
and
bright
it
only
friendship
now
for
she
not
much
more
than
a
child
and
i
would
ask
too
much
too
soon
but
some
day
give
me
your
blessing
mother
for
i
been
lonely
without
you
as
long
as
i
can
bear
it
chapter
x
the
gentle
art
of
cooking
in
a
discoursed
captain
john
rayburn
lightly
stirring
in
a
silver
basin
the
ingredients
of
the
cream
sauce
he
was
making
for
the
chopped
chicken
which
stood
at
hand
in
a
bowl
is
one
particularly
adapted
to
the
really
intelligent
masculine
mind
no
noise
no
fuss
no
worry
no
smoke
everything
systematic
with
a
practised
hand
he
added
the
cream
little
by
little
to
the
melted
butter
and
flour
and
practical
it
is
a
pleasure
to
contemplate
the
delicate
growth
of
such
a
dish
as
this
which
i
am
preparing
it
is
you
have
thickening
enough
for
all
that
cream
celia
interrupted
doubtfully
watching
her
uncle
cookery
with
an
anxious
eye
and
you
have
sufficient
mental
poise
to
be
able
to
lecture
on
cookery
and
do
the
trick
at
the
same
time
supplemented
doctor
churchill
his
eyes
also
on
the
in
fact
everybody
eyes
were
on
the
the
entire
birch
family
doctor
churchill
lanse
friend
mary
atkinson
jeff
comrade
carolyn
houghton
and
just
inseparable
norman
carter
just
scorned
girls
and
when
asked
to
choose
whom
he
would
have
as
a
guest
for
captain
rayburn
picnic
mentioned
norman
with
an
air
of
finality
sat
about
a
large
rustic
table
upon
a
charming
spot
of
greensward
among
the
trees
of
a
little
island
four
miles
down
the
river
a
great
bowl
of
decorated
the
centre
of
the
table
and
bunches
of
the
same
flowers
tied
with
long
yellow
ribbons
lay
at
each
plate
when
captain
rayburn
entertained
he
always
did
it
in
style
and
since
this
picnic
had
been
especially
designed
to
celebrate
the
of
the
travellers
a
week
after
their
arrival
no
pains
had
been
spared
to
make
the
festival
one
to
be
remembered
birch
was
in
the
seat
of
honour
a
position
which
she
graced
in
a
summer
gown
of
white
her
face
round
and
glowing
as
it
had
not
been
in
years
she
seemed
the
central
flower
of
a
most
attractive
bouquet
birch
looked
about
him
with
appreciative
eyes
i
do
think
could
attend
to
the
with
any
certainty
of
result
he
remarked
i
am
too
much
occupied
in
observing
the
guests
it
strikes
me
that
nowhere
either
in
new
mexico
or
colorado
did
i
see
any
people
approaching
those
before
me
in
interest
and
attractiveness
except
one
he
amended
as
a
general
laugh
greeted
this
extraordinary
statement
and
even
she
never
seemed
to
me
quite
so
he
hesitated
say
it
sir
cried
lanse
we
with
you
whatever
it
is
i
think
is
the
word
you
want
birch
face
lighted
with
a
smile
thank
you
that
is
the
word
he
said
the
captain
stirred
his
chopped
chicken
into
his
cream
sauce
with
the
air
of
a
chef
now
here
you
are
he
said
the
captain
would
not
allow
everything
upon
the
table
at
once
picnic
fashion
but
kept
the
viands
behind
a
screen
a
few
feet
away
and
with
jeff
and
just
assistance
served
them
according
to
his
ideas
of
the
fitness
of
things
toward
the
end
of
the
feast
a
particularly
fine
strawberry
shortcake
appeared
which
was
followed
by
altogether
the
guests
declared
no
picnic
had
ever
been
so
satisfactory
is
the
captain
great
said
doctor
churchill
enthusiastically
to
celia
when
they
had
all
left
the
table
and
were
beginning
to
stroll
about
cut
off
from
the
sort
of
thing
he
would
like
best
to
do
that
he
aches
to
do
he
occupies
himself
with
what
comes
in
his
way
he
would
deceive
any
one
into
thinking
him
completely
satisfied
i
so
glad
you
understand
him
celia
answered
everybody
does
just
the
other
day
a
caller
said
to
me
it
lovely
that
captain
rayburn
is
so
contented
with
his
quiet
life
whenever
i
see
him
sitting
in
the
park
with
the
baby
and
a
book
i
think
what
a
mercy
it
is
that
he
is
like
some
men
or
he
never
could
take
it
so
calmly
calmly
uncle
ray
would
give
his
life
night
if
he
could
have
a
day
at
the
head
of
his
company
over
there
in
the
philippines
i
do
doubt
it
for
an
instant
since
i
known
him
i
learned
more
admiration
for
the
way
he
keeps
himself
in
hand
than
i
ever
had
for
any
single
quality
in
any
human
being
i
mighty
sorry
he
going
away
it
for
a
year
in
france
and
italy
he
tells
me
yes
he
very
fond
of
travel
and
i
imagine
he
a
little
restless
after
the
winter
here
do
you
know
what
i
suspect
that
he
came
just
so
that
mother
might
feel
somebody
was
keeping
an
eye
on
us
that
would
be
like
him
he
immensely
fond
of
you
all
celia
caught
sight
of
her
uncle
beckoning
to
her
and
went
to
him
doctor
churchill
saw
birch
lying
among
the
gay
striped
pillows
in
a
hammock
which
had
been
brought
along
for
her
special
use
and
went
over
to
her
his
eyes
noted
the
direction
in
which
charlotte
was
vanishing
but
he
sat
down
on
a
log
by
the
hammock
as
if
he
had
no
other
thought
than
for
the
gracious
lady
who
looked
up
at
him
with
a
smile
and
indeed
he
had
thought
for
her
it
was
impossible
to
be
with
her
and
not
give
oneself
up
to
her
charm
i
have
been
wanting
to
see
you
alone
for
a
minute
doctor
churchill
she
said
it
has
been
such
a
busy
week
i
have
had
half
a
chance
to
express
to
you
how
i
appreciate
your
care
for
my
little
family
and
especially
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
the
perfect
recovery
of
knee
doctor
forester
has
assured
me
that
the
knee
might
easily
have
been
a
bad
case
i
am
very
thankful
that
the
results
were
good
birch
doctor
churchill
answered
nobody
interrupted
the
two
for
a
long
at
the
end
of
it
doctor
churchill
rose
his
eyes
kindling
thank
you
he
said
fervently
thank
you
more
than
that
i
ask
yet
but
if
you
will
trust
me
i
promise
you
may
trust
me
little
as
you
know
me
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
keep
my
word
not
only
to
you
but
to
my
mother
i
know
her
ideals
and
if
i
can
be
fit
to
be
the
friend
of
one
who
fills
them
birch
held
out
her
hand
i
do
trust
you
doctor
churchill
she
said
not
only
from
what
doctor
forester
has
told
me
of
your
family
but
from
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
for
myself
with
a
light
heart
the
doctor
went
away
over
the
hill
to
the
path
which
descended
to
the
river
far
down
the
bank
near
the
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
blue
linen
gown
captain
rayburn
and
celia
came
over
to
establish
themselves
upon
rugs
and
cushions
by
the
side
of
the
hammock
birch
who
had
been
out
with
just
and
norman
in
a
boat
appeared
sunburned
and
warm
and
joined
the
party
i
been
wanting
to
get
just
this
quartet
together
remarked
the
captain
when
his
had
cooled
off
and
was
lying
comfortably
stretched
along
a
mossy
knoll
go
ahead
jack
we
are
ready
to
listen
your
plans
are
always
interesting
birch
replied
what
now
in
the
first
place
began
the
captain
i
want
you
people
to
understand
that
the
person
who
has
had
least
fun
out
of
this
absence
of
yours
is
the
young
woman
before
you
o
uncle
ray
protested
celia
instantly
have
i
had
as
much
fun
as
you
hardly
between
fields
and
miss
ellen
donohue
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
enlivened
i
hardly
know
which
of
the
two
has
afforded
me
more
downright
amusement
each
in
her
way
but
celia
i
tell
you
roderick
and
helen
has
been
one
brave
girl
and
that
all
there
is
of
it
you
find
no
dissenting
voice
here
celia
father
declared
and
her
mother
added
nobody
who
knows
her
could
expect
her
to
be
anything
else
celia
looked
away
her
cheeks
flushing
so
now
i
want
her
to
have
her
reward
said
captain
rayburn
let
me
take
her
with
me
for
the
year
abroad
celia
started
glancing
quickly
from
her
father
to
her
mother
neither
of
whom
looked
so
surprised
as
she
would
have
expected
both
returned
her
gaze
thoughtfully
how
about
the
going
to
college
birch
questioned
i
thought
that
was
the
great
ambition
she
shall
have
a
four
year
course
in
one
if
she
comes
with
me
i
shall
spend
much
time
in
the
libraries
and
art
collections
my
friends
in
several
cities
are
people
it
is
worth
a
long
journey
to
meet
undoubtedly
such
a
year
would
be
valuable
at
the
end
of
a
college
course
and
it
may
appear
to
you
that
the
studies
within
the
scholastic
walls
in
this
country
had
better
come
first
the
point
is
that
i
am
going
now
i
may
not
be
at
the
moment
celia
takes
her
diploma
and
the
question
of
her
health
seems
to
me
also
one
to
be
considered
months
of
enforced
quiet
have
been
any
too
good
for
her
there
not
much
need
to
ask
celia
what
she
would
like
birch
observed
the
girl
studied
his
face
anxiously
but
could
you
spare
me
she
asked
if
it
means
that
mother
would
have
to
take
my
place
again
it
wo
mean
that
said
captain
rayburn
stoutly
my
plans
cover
two
maids
in
the
birch
household
the
most
capable
to
be
obtained
see
here
jack
said
roderick
birch
quickly
you
ca
play
good
fairy
for
the
whole
family
and
it
not
necessary
as
soon
as
i
am
at
work
in
the
office
again
this
close
figuring
will
be
over
i
want
my
niece
charlotte
to
go
to
her
school
of
design
the
captain
went
on
imperturbably
we
mean
that
she
shall
i
wish
you
people
would
let
me
alone
he
cried
here
i
am
your
only
brother
without
a
chick
or
a
child
of
my
own
am
i
to
be
denied
what
is
the
greatest
delight
i
can
have
by
a
lucky
accident
my
money
was
safe
in
the
panic
that
swept
away
yours
pure
luck
or
providence
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
certainly
not
because
my
business
sagacity
was
any
greater
than
yours
you
would
take
a
cent
from
me
at
the
time
but
you
got
to
let
me
have
my
way
now
celia
goes
with
me
if
you
agree
charlotte
goes
to
her
art
school
and
if
you
refuse
me
the
fun
of
assuming
both
expenses
i
be
tremendously
offended
no
joke
i
shall
he
looked
so
fierce
that
everybody
laughed
somewhat
tremulously
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
meant
all
he
said
celia
cheeks
were
pink
with
excitement
birch
were
of
a
similar
hue
in
sympathy
with
her
daughter
joy
i
tell
you
that
girl
charlotte
began
the
captain
again
deserves
all
anybody
can
do
for
her
she
has
developed
three
years
in
one
fond
as
i
always
been
of
her
i
had
the
least
idea
what
was
in
the
child
she
going
to
make
a
woman
of
a
rare
sort
look
here
a
new
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
considered
it
for
the
space
of
a
then
brought
it
forth
let
me
take
her
too
not
for
the
year
do
look
as
if
i
hit
you
helen
just
till
october
i
mean
to
sail
in
ten
days
you
know
engaged
plenty
of
room
there
be
no
trouble
about
a
berth
o
uncle
ray
celia
interrupted
him
there
could
be
no
question
about
her
unselfish
soul
if
she
had
been
happy
before
she
was
rapturous
now
three
months
will
give
her
quite
a
journey
the
captain
hurried
on
leaving
nobody
any
time
for
objections
i
see
that
she
gets
art
enough
out
of
it
to
fill
her
to
the
brim
with
inspiration
and
there
will
surely
be
somebody
she
can
come
back
with
may
i
have
her
what
shall
we
do
with
you
his
sister
said
softly
i
ca
deny
you
or
her
if
her
father
agrees
if
i
did
know
your
big
heart
so
well
jack
said
roderick
birch
slowly
i
should
be
too
proud
to
accept
so
much
even
from
my
brother
but
i
believe
it
would
be
unworthy
of
me
or
of
you
to
let
false
pride
stand
in
my
girls
way
from
the
distance
two
figures
were
approaching
one
in
blue
linen
the
other
in
white
flannel
charlotte
and
doctor
churchill
they
were
talking
gaily
laughing
like
a
pair
of
very
happy
children
and
carrying
between
them
a
great
bunch
of
daisies
and
buttercups
that
would
have
hid
a
church
pulpit
from
view
let
tell
her
now
proposed
celia
i
ca
wait
to
have
her
know
go
ahead
agreed
her
uncle
and
let
the
doctor
hear
it
too
if
he
is
a
brother
of
the
family
it
because
the
family
does
know
one
of
the
finest
fellows
on
the
face
of
the
earth
when
it
sees
him
you
a
most
discerning
chap
jack
rayburn
said
his
heartily
but
there
are
other
people
with
discernment
i
have
liked
young
churchill
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
first
all
that
forester
says
of
him
confirms
my
opinion
how
excited
you
people
all
look
called
charlotte
merrily
as
she
drew
near
tell
us
why
captain
rayburn
nodded
to
celia
she
shook
her
head
vigorously
in
return
he
glanced
at
and
birch
both
of
whom
smilingly
refused
to
speak
so
he
looked
up
at
charlotte
and
put
his
question
as
he
might
have
fired
a
shot
will
you
sail
for
europe
with
celia
and
me
week
after
next
to
stay
till
october
celia
will
stay
the
year
with
me
you
i
shall
ship
home
as
useless
baggage
in
the
fall
charlotte
stood
still
her
arms
tightening
about
the
daisies
and
buttercups
as
if
they
represented
a
baby
whom
she
must
not
let
fall
a
rich
wave
of
colour
swept
over
her
face
she
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
group
as
if
she
could
not
believe
her
good
fortune
then
suddenly
she
dropped
her
flowers
in
an
abandoned
heap
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
and
drew
one
long
breath
of
delight
can
you
spare
me
she
murmured
her
eyes
upon
her
mother
birch
nodded
smiling
i
surely
can
she
said
turn
about
is
fair
play
said
birch
and
your
uncle
seems
to
consider
himself
a
person
of
authority
i
want
declared
captain
rayburn
his
bright
eyes
studying
each
niece
winsome
young
face
in
turn
in
the
interest
of
the
family
orchestra
to
tune
the
violins
speaking
of
violins
said
the
captain
half
an
hour
later
quite
as
if
no
interval
of
busy
talk
and
had
occurred
suppose
we
see
about
how
far
off
the
key
they
are
at
present
jeff
just
everybody
stared
then
laughed
for
jeff
and
just
instantly
produced
from
behind
that
same
screen
five
familiar
shapes
the
entire
company
had
reassembled
under
the
drawn
together
by
a
secret
summons
from
the
captain
now
see
here
uncle
ray
remonstrated
his
eldest
nephew
this
is
stealing
a
march
on
us
with
a
vengeance
i
entirely
willing
you
should
let
a
march
steal
on
me
retorted
the
captain
disposing
himself
comfortably
among
his
rugs
and
cushions
or
a
waltz
or
a
lullaby
or
anything
else
you
choose
but
music
of
some
sort
i
must
have
laughing
they
tuned
their
instruments
and
the
rest
of
the
company
settled
down
to
listen
lanse
his
eyes
mischievous
passed
a
whispered
word
among
the
musicians
and
presently
at
the
signal
the
notes
of
to
the
were
sounding
through
the
woods
played
with
great
spirit
and
zest
and
as
they
played
the
five
birches
marched
to
position
in
front
of
the
captain
then
stood
still
and
saluted
off
with
you
you
strolling
players
cried
the
captain
the
spectacle
of
a
player
attempting
to
carry
his
instrument
and
perform
upon
it
at
the
same
time
is
enough
to
upset
me
for
a
week
sit
down
comfortably
and
give
us
sweetest
flower
that
so
they
played
softly
now
and
with
full
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
melodious
song
was
one
of
their
mother
favourites
but
suddenly
they
had
a
fresh
surprise
for
as
they
played
a
voice
from
the
little
audience
joined
them
under
his
breath
at
first
then
as
the
captain
turned
and
made
vigorous
signs
to
the
singer
to
let
his
voice
be
heard
with
tunefully
swelling
notes
which
fell
upon
all
their
ears
like
music
of
a
rare
sort
the
sweetest
flower
that
blows
i
give
you
as
we
part
to
you
it
is
a
rose
to
me
it
is
my
heart
the
captain
knew
as
the
voice
went
on
that
those
barytone
notes
were
very
fine
ones
knew
better
than
the
rest
as
having
a
wider
acquaintance
with
voices
in
general
but
they
all
understood
that
it
was
to
no
ordinary
singer
they
were
listening
when
the
song
ended
the
captain
reached
over
and
laid
a
brotherly
arm
on
doctor
churchill
shoulder
welcome
friend
he
said
with
feeling
in
his
voice
you
given
the
countersign
but
the
doctor
although
he
received
modestly
the
words
of
praise
which
fell
upon
him
from
all
about
would
sing
no
more
that
day
it
had
been
the
first
time
for
almost
three
years
and
sweetest
flower
that
was
not
only
birch
favourite
song
it
had
been
churchill
also
see
here
churchill
said
lanse
as
the
orchestra
rested
for
a
moment
do
you
play
any
instrument
only
as
a
novice
admitted
the
doctor
with
some
reluctance
which
one
the
fiddle
and
never
owned
up
chided
lanse
you
did
want
to
belong
to
such
an
amateurish
company
i
did
very
much
said
churchill
with
emphasis
but
you
needed
no
more
violins
if
i
to
be
away
all
next
year
said
celia
quickly
they
will
need
you
will
you
take
my
place
no
indeed
miss
celia
the
doctor
answered
decidedly
but
if
you
would
let
me
play
second
he
looked
at
charlotte
smiling
she
returned
his
smile
but
shook
her
head
i
second
fiddle
she
said
i
never
take
celia
place
the
eyes
of
the
two
sisters
met
affectionately
comprehendingly
i
should
like
to
have
you
dear
said
celia
softly
but
charlotte
only
shook
her
head
again
colouring
beneath
the
glances
which
fell
on
her
from
all
sides
i
rather
play
my
old
part
she
answered
jeff
caught
up
and
lifted
high
in
the
air
an
imaginary
glass
here
to
the
orchestra
he
called
out
may
doctor
churchill
read
the
score
of
the
first
violin
here
to
the
first
violin
may
she
hear
plenty
of
fine
music
in
the
old
country
and
come
back
ready
to
coach
us
all
and
here
he
paused
and
looked
impressively
round
upon
the
company
who
regarded
him
in
turn
with
interested
sympathetic
eyes
i
say
we
called
her
fiddle
long
enough
he
said
and
hesitated
beginning
to
get
stranded
in
his
own
eloquence
anyhow
if
she
has
proved
this
year
that
she
fit
to
play
anything
dishes
or
or
babies
he
stopped
laughing
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
but
as
sure
as
my
jefferson
birch
she
er
hear
hear
the
captain
encouraged
him
softly
here
shouted
the
boy
here
to
the
second
violin
through
the
friendly
laughter
and
murmurs
of
appreciation
charlotte
dropping
shy
happy
eyes
read
the
real
love
and
respect
of
everybody
and
felt
that
the
year
experiences
had
brought
her
a
rich
reward
but
all
she
said
as
jeff
exhausted
by
his
effort
at
oratory
dropped
upon
the
grass
beside
her
was
in
his
ear
if
anybody
deserves
a
toast
jeffy
boy
i
think
it
you
you
eaten
so
many
slices
of
mine
burnt
to
a
cinder
and
never
winced
if
that
is
heroism
what
is
book
ii
the
churchill
chapter
i
here
another
charlotte
young
justin
birch
lusty
shout
rang
through
the
house
from
hall
to
kitchen
vibrating
even
as
far
as
the
room
in
the
rear
where
charlotte
herself
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
in
response
people
appeared
from
everywhere
the
was
the
last
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
when
she
came
there
was
a
certain
reluctance
in
her
aspect
hurry
up
there
admonished
just
already
busy
with
chisel
and
hammer
at
the
slender
flat
box
which
lay
upon
the
hall
floor
in
the
centre
of
an
interested
group
he
paused
to
glance
up
at
his
sister
where
she
had
stopped
upon
the
landing
you
act
as
if
you
did
want
to
see
in
it
he
remonstrated
whacking
away
vigorously
indeed
i
do
charlotte
declared
coming
on
down
the
staircase
smiling
at
the
faces
upturned
toward
her
which
were
smiling
back
every
one
but
i
beginning
to
feel
as
if
i
as
if
they
as
if
it
must
seem
odd
to
feel
like
that
john
lansing
agreed
quizzically
lanse
had
but
just
arrived
having
come
on
especially
for
the
wedding
from
the
at
which
he
had
been
for
two
years
celia
slipped
her
arm
about
her
younger
sister
shoulders
i
know
what
she
means
she
said
in
her
gentle
way
it
so
unexpected
to
her
after
sending
out
no
invitations
at
all
that
gifts
should
keep
pouring
in
like
this
but
it
not
unexpected
to
us
oh
i
know
how
many
of
them
come
from
father
and
mother
friends
and
how
many
from
andy
grateful
patients
it
all
the
more
overwhelming
on
that
account
look
out
there
just
the
admonition
came
from
jeff
and
consequently
was
delivered
from
some
six
feet
in
the
air
where
that
head
was
now
carried
do
split
those
pieces
they
be
fine
for
the
emerson
boys
building
that
so
just
wielded
his
tools
with
more
care
presently
he
had
the
long
parcel
lying
on
the
floor
at
this
moment
roderick
birch
opened
the
outer
hall
door
as
usual
was
his
smiling
comment
as
he
laid
aside
hat
and
overcoat
and
joined
the
circle
charlotte
latest
charlotte
herself
undid
the
wrappings
wondering
what
the
gift
could
be
she
disclosed
a
long
piece
of
metal
a
new
shingle
for
andy
cried
jeff
just
turned
the
heavy
slab
over
and
it
proved
to
be
of
copper
words
came
into
view
hammered
and
beaten
into
the
glinting
metal
an
effective
conventionalised
border
surrounded
the
whole
ornaments
of
a
house
are
ye
guests
who
frequent
it
read
the
assembled
company
in
chorus
oh
is
that
beautiful
cried
charlotte
jeff
glanced
at
her
suspiciously
she
says
that
about
everything
he
remarked
do
think
much
of
it
myself
the
sentiment
may
be
awfully
true
or
otherwise
but
what
the
thing
for
if
anybody
wanted
to
hint
at
an
invitation
to
visit
andy
and
charlotte
he
might
have
done
it
without
putting
himself
on
record
on
a
slab
of
copper
four
feet
long
who
sent
it
anyway
celia
hunted
carefully
through
the
wrappings
and
everybody
finally
joined
in
the
search
but
no
card
appeared
i
so
sorry
lamented
charlotte
i
shall
never
know
whom
to
thank
it
lets
you
out
anyhow
jeff
said
soothingly
you
wo
have
to
tell
any
lies
the
thing
is
of
about
as
much
use
as
a
bootjack
why
but
it
lovely
protested
charlotte
with
evident
sincerity
copper
things
are
very
highly
valued
just
now
and
the
work
on
that
is
artistic
do
you
see
it
is
ca
see
it
murmured
jeff
but
of
course
my
not
seeing
it
count
i
ca
see
the
value
of
that
idiotic
old
copper
pail
you
cherish
so
tenderly
but
that
because
i
lack
the
true
artist
soul
where
are
you
going
to
put
this
fiddle
charlotte
eyes
grew
absent
she
was
sending
them
in
imagination
across
the
lawn
to
the
little
old
brick
house
next
door
which
was
soon
to
be
her
home
as
she
had
done
every
time
a
new
gift
arrived
there
were
a
good
many
puzzles
of
this
sort
in
connection
with
her
wedding
gifts
where
to
put
some
of
them
she
knew
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
the
instant
she
set
eyes
on
them
where
in
the
world
others
could
possibly
go
was
undoubtedly
a
serious
question
hello
here
comes
andy
called
just
from
the
window
give
him
a
chance
at
it
perhaps
he
can
use
it
somewhere
in
the
surgery
as
a
delicate
way
of
cheering
the
patients
when
they
feel
as
if
perhaps
they
better
not
have
come
charlotte
turned
as
the
hall
door
swung
open
admitting
andrew
churchill
and
a
fresh
breath
of
october
air
everybody
turned
about
also
into
everybody
face
came
a
look
of
affectionate
greeting
even
the
eyes
of
the
father
and
mother
and
this
just
now
was
the
greatest
test
of
all
showed
the
welcome
to
which
their
own
children
were
happily
used
the
figure
on
the
threshold
was
one
to
claim
attention
anywhere
it
was
a
strong
figure
with
a
look
of
life
and
intense
physical
vigour
the
face
matched
the
body
it
was
and
finely
molded
and
nobody
who
looked
at
it
and
into
the
clear
gray
eyes
of
andrew
churchill
could
fail
to
recognise
the
man
behind
lanse
who
was
nearest
shook
hands
warmly
it
seems
good
to
see
you
old
fellow
he
said
heartily
if
this
whirl
of
work
they
tell
me
you
are
in
had
kept
up
much
longer
i
should
have
turned
patient
myself
and
sent
for
you
going
to
find
time
to
be
married
in
think
andy
i
rather
expect
to
be
able
to
manage
it
responded
doctor
churchill
laughing
how
long
have
you
been
home
lanse
two
hours
just
promised
to
let
me
know
when
you
came
i
started
but
you
were
whizzing
up
the
street
in
the
runabout
protested
just
picking
up
the
dÃ©bris
of
the
unpacking
and
carrying
it
away
there
was
a
trail
of
steam
behind
you
sixteen
feet
long
i
think
you
were
running
beyond
lawful
speed
here
your
latest
acquisition
jeff
pointed
it
out
picking
up
the
copper
slab
and
holding
it
at
the
stretch
of
his
arms
for
inspection
doctor
churchill
turned
and
regarded
it
with
interest
then
his
bright
glance
shifted
to
charlotte
and
he
smiled
at
her
that
great
is
it
he
said
and
she
nodded
smiling
just
returning
shouted
trust
both
to
get
round
anything
that
may
turn
up
great
is
certainly
safe
and
of
a
motto
that
of
no
earthly
use
well
but
i
like
it
doctor
churchill
asserted
and
came
over
to
charlotte
side
where
he
examined
the
copper
slab
with
attention
do
you
believe
that
will
pretty
nearly
fit
the
depression
in
the
fireplace
just
above
the
shelf
her
interested
look
responded
to
his
why
i
believe
it
will
she
answered
who
sent
it
we
ca
find
out
no
card
that
odd
but
there
may
be
something
about
it
to
show
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
that
place
if
it
proves
to
fit
we
can
narrow
the
mystery
down
to
the
few
people
who
have
seen
the
new
fireplace
let
go
over
and
try
shall
we
come
on
everybody
accordingly
the
whole
company
streamed
out
across
the
lawn
charlotte
and
doctor
churchill
celia
her
pretty
blond
head
shining
in
the
october
sunlight
lanse
and
jeff
and
just
three
stalwart
fellows
ranging
in
ages
from
to
sixteen
and
birch
the
happy
possessors
of
this
happy
clan
they
hurried
up
the
two
steps
of
the
small
front
porch
into
the
brick
house
and
stampeded
into
the
front
room
they
stopped
opposite
the
fireplace
where
doctor
churchill
was
already
triumphantly
inserting
the
copper
panel
for
that
is
what
it
instantly
became
in
the
long
horizontal
depression
in
the
fireplace
it
fits
to
a
hair
he
exclaimed
and
a
general
murmur
of
approbation
arose
now
that
the
odd
gift
was
where
it
so
clearly
belonged
its
peculiar
beauty
became
evident
even
to
the
skeptical
jeff
and
just
the
new
fireplace
was
the
heart
of
the
little
old
house
moreover
so
cunningly
had
it
been
designed
and
built
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
in
its
place
from
the
beginning
doctor
churchill
and
charlotte
had
made
a
certain
distant
field
the
object
of
many
walks
and
drives
and
had
personally
selected
the
hardheads
of
which
the
fireplace
was
constructed
a
small
bedroom
opening
off
the
square
little
parlour
had
had
its
partition
removed
and
in
this
end
of
the
room
the
fireplace
had
been
built
the
effect
was
very
good
and
the
resulting
apartment
the
only
one
on
the
lower
floor
which
could
be
spared
for
general
use
had
become
at
once
the
place
upon
which
charlotte
was
concentrating
most
of
her
efforts
meaning
to
make
it
a
room
where
everybody
should
wish
to
come
the
usual
interruption
of
a
summons
for
doctor
churchill
to
the
office
in
the
wing
sent
the
assembled
company
off
again
just
as
charlotte
was
leaving
the
room
however
the
last
of
all
because
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
desert
the
joy
of
the
copper
panel
in
its
setting
of
gray
stone
doctor
churchill
hurriedly
returned
seeing
charlotte
alone
and
about
to
vanish
he
ran
after
her
and
drew
her
back
i
have
to
go
right
away
dear
he
said
but
i
want
to
look
at
the
new
gift
alone
with
you
a
minute
it
really
a
fine
addition
is
it
oh
beautiful
in
the
firelight
and
the
lamplight
how
that
copper
will
gleam
i
wish
we
knew
to
whom
we
owe
such
a
thought
of
us
i
like
the
sentiment
too
do
you
charlotte
i
hope
do
you
know
it
one
of
my
pleasantest
hopes
that
our
home
is
going
to
be
one
that
knows
how
to
dispense
hospitality
the
real
sort
not
the
sham
charlotte
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
as
if
i
need
tell
you
what
i
wish
he
said
with
gay
tenderness
you
know
every
thought
i
have
about
it
we
make
people
happy
here
said
charlotte
indeed
i
want
to
andy
churchill
this
room
they
shall
find
a
welcome
always
rich
and
poor
especially
the
poor
ones
especially
the
poor
ones
wo
old
wilsey
think
it
pleasant
here
and
tom
brannigan
he
be
scared
at
first
but
we
show
him
it
a
jolly
place
charlotte
i
mus
get
to
dreaming
now
or
i
never
can
summon
strength
of
purpose
to
wait
another
week
one
week
from
what
an
age
it
seems
run
and
make
your
calls
advised
charlotte
laughing
as
she
escaped
from
him
and
hurried
to
the
door
the
busier
you
keep
the
shorter
the
time
will
seem
the
week
went
by
at
last
to
the
young
man
one
of
a
large
family
long
since
scattered
many
members
of
it
including
both
father
and
mother
in
the
old
virginia
churchyard
the
time
could
not
come
too
soon
he
had
lived
alone
with
his
housekeeper
almost
four
years
now
and
during
nearly
all
that
time
he
had
been
waiting
for
charlotte
she
was
considerably
younger
than
he
and
when
he
had
been
after
two
years
of
acquaintance
allowed
to
betroth
himself
to
her
he
had
been
asked
to
wait
yet
another
two
years
while
she
should
grow
up
a
little
more
as
her
wise
father
put
it
as
for
charlotte
herself
she
still
seemed
to
those
who
loved
her
at
home
hardly
grown
up
enough
at
to
go
to
a
home
of
her
own
yet
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sister
were
all
ready
to
acknowledge
that
those
two
years
had
resulted
in
the
early
budding
of
very
sweet
and
womanly
qualities
and
nobody
watching
charlotte
with
her
lover
could
possibly
fear
for
either
that
they
were
not
ready
for
the
great
experiment
the
autumn
leaves
were
bright
the
white
fall
anemones
were
in
blossom
when
charlotte
came
and
with
leaves
and
anemones
the
little
stone
church
was
decorated
not
an
invitation
of
the
customary
sort
had
been
sent
out
but
as
is
usual
in
a
comfortable
suburb
the
news
that
doctor
churchill
and
miss
charlotte
birch
wanted
everybody
who
knew
and
cared
for
them
to
come
to
the
church
and
see
them
married
had
spread
until
all
understood
the
result
was
that
no
one
of
doctor
churchill
patients
and
he
had
won
a
large
and
growing
practice
among
all
classes
of
people
felt
left
out
or
forgotten
and
that
as
the
clock
struck
the
hour
of
noon
the
church
was
crowded
to
the
doors
with
those
who
were
real
friends
of
the
young
people
somehow
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
a
bride
said
charlotte
looking
however
very
much
like
one
as
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
her
room
in
bridal
array
four
elegant
male
figures
two
in
frock
coats
two
in
more
youthful
but
equally
festive
attire
were
surveying
her
with
satisfaction
near
by
hovered
celia
the
daintiest
of
maids
of
honour
birch
as
charming
as
a
girl
herself
in
her
pale
gray
silken
gown
and
little
ellen
donohue
a
protÃ©gÃ©e
of
the
family
her
hazel
eyes
wide
with
gazing
at
charlotte
whom
she
hugged
intermittently
and
adored
without
cessation
you
do
feel
like
a
bride
eh
was
lanse
reply
to
statement
well
i
should
think
you
would
an
infant
like
you
you
look
more
suitable
for
a
christening
than
for
a
marriage
ceremony
father
likely
when
doctor
elder
asks
who
gives
the
bride
away
to
murmur
wendell
thinking
he
inquiring
the
child
name
charlotte
threw
him
a
glance
as
best
man
you
should
be
saying
complimentary
things
about
your
friend
choice
i
am
the
trouble
is
you
not
old
enough
to
enjoy
being
mistaken
for
a
babe
in
arms
i
do
think
she
looks
like
a
child
i
think
she
the
stunningest
young
woman
i
ever
saw
declared
just
with
enthusiasm
if
her
hair
was
done
up
on
top
of
her
head
she
be
a
regular
queen
celia
laughed
her
own
beautiful
blond
locks
were
piled
high
and
the
style
became
her
but
charlotte
dusky
braids
were
prettier
low
on
the
white
neck
in
the
girlish
fashion
in
which
they
had
long
been
worn
and
celia
announced
this
fact
with
a
loving
touch
on
the
graceful
her
own
hands
had
arranged
for
her
sister
you
ca
improve
her
she
said
she
looks
like
our
charlotte
and
that
just
the
way
we
want
her
to
look
that
what
andy
wants
too
of
course
he
does
and
i
can
tell
you
he
looks
like
andy
lanse
asserted
did
you
know
he
been
making
calls
all
the
morning
the
same
as
usual
made
till
the
last
minute
too
it
is
fifteen
minutes
since
i
saw
his
machine
roll
in
hope
he
was
rattled
when
he
wrote
his
prescriptions
it
was
the
birches
custom
to
make
as
little
as
possible
of
family
crises
talk
and
laugh
as
lightly
as
they
would
however
every
one
of
them
was
watching
charlotte
with
anxiety
for
it
was
the
first
break
in
the
dear
circle
and
it
seemed
almost
as
if
they
could
have
better
spared
any
other
yet
charlotte
was
going
to
live
no
farther
away
than
next
door
this
was
the
comfort
of
the
situation
well
i
must
be
off
to
look
after
my
duties
to
the
groom
lanse
announced
presently
with
a
precautionary
glance
into
his
mirror
to
make
sure
that
not
a
hair
of
his
splendour
was
disturbed
i
ought
to
have
been
with
him
before
this
only
my
infatuation
for
the
bride
makes
my
case
difficult
you
heard
of
these
fellows
who
hang
about
another
chap
girl
till
the
last
minute
doing
the
forsaken
act
i
feel
something
like
that
good
luck
little
girl
keep
cool
and
trust
andy
and
doctor
elder
to
get
you
safely
married
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
and
charlotte
held
him
close
for
an
instant
but
he
made
the
brotherly
embrace
a
short
one
comprehending
that
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
would
be
unsafe
both
for
charlotte
and
her
family
and
went
gaily
away
to
the
house
next
door
nerve
good
lanse
asked
doctor
churchill
an
hour
later
as
they
waited
in
the
vestry
for
the
summons
of
the
organ
doctor
churchill
smiled
pretty
steady
he
answered
still
i
aware
something
is
about
to
happen
lanse
eyed
him
affectionately
do
you
know
it
a
good
deal
to
me
to
be
gaining
three
brothers
by
this
day
work
the
doctor
added
and
lanse
felt
a
sudden
lump
in
his
throat
which
he
had
to
swallow
before
he
could
answer
i
assure
you
we
feeling
pretty
rich
too
old
fellow
it
was
all
over
presently
a
very
simple
natural
sort
of
affair
with
the
warm
october
sunlight
streaming
through
the
richly
coloured
windows
upon
the
figures
at
the
altar
touching
celia
bright
hair
into
a
halo
and
sending
a
ruby
beam
across
the
trailing
folds
of
charlotte
bridal
gown
there
was
no
display
of
any
sort
the
whole
effect
was
somehow
that
of
a
girl
being
married
in
the
enclosing
circle
of
her
family
without
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
eyes
upon
her
a
quiet
wedding
breakfast
followed
at
which
doctor
forester
and
his
son
the
latter
lately
returned
from
a
long
period
of
study
abroad
were
the
only
guests
doctor
churchill
housekeeper
fields
although
invited
to
be
present
as
a
guest
insisted
on
remaining
in
the
kitchen
just
as
if
she
said
when
everybody
in
turn
remonstrated
with
her
when
i
looked
after
that
boy
food
from
the
days
when
he
ate
nothing
but
porridge
and
milk
i
was
going
to
let
anybody
else
feed
him
with
his
wedding
breakfast
but
this
part
of
the
business
of
getting
married
was
also
soon
over
doctor
churchill
was
to
take
his
bride
away
for
a
month
stay
in
a
little
southern
resort
among
the
mountains
dear
to
him
by
old
association
it
was
the
first
vacation
he
had
allowed
himself
during
these
four
years
of
his
practice
and
his
eyes
had
been
sparkling
as
he
planned
it
they
were
sparkling
again
now
as
he
stood
waiting
for
charlotte
to
say
and
come
away
with
him
but
his
face
spoke
his
sympathetic
understanding
of
those
who
were
finding
this
the
hardest
moment
which
had
yet
come
to
them
take
care
of
her
andy
was
what
in
almost
the
same
words
they
all
more
or
less
brokenly
said
to
him
at
last
and
to
each
and
all
he
answered
in
that
way
of
his
they
loved
and
trusted
i
will
from
andrew
churchill
it
was
assurance
enough
chapter
ii
there
does
that
look
like
a
home
celia
stood
in
the
doorway
and
surveyed
her
handiwork
birch
from
an
opposite
threshold
nodded
smiling
it
does
indeed
you
have
given
the
whole
house
a
festival
air
which
will
captivate
andy
heart
the
instant
he
sets
eyes
on
it
as
for
our
little
charlotte
she
paused
as
if
it
were
not
easy
to
put
into
words
that
which
she
knew
charlotte
would
think
but
celia
went
on
gleefully
charlotte
will
be
so
crazy
with
delight
at
getting
home
she
will
see
everything
through
a
blur
at
first
but
when
we
have
all
gone
away
and
left
them
here
then
charlotte
will
see
and
she
be
glad
to
find
traces
of
her
devoted
family
wherever
she
looks
she
pointed
from
the
little
on
the
table
by
the
window
just
equipped
and
placed
there
by
her
mother
hand
to
the
made
and
put
up
in
the
corner
by
jeff
she
waved
her
hand
at
a
great
wicker
armchair
with
deep
pockets
at
the
sides
for
newspapers
and
magazines
which
had
been
birch
contribution
to
the
and
at
the
fine
calendar
which
just
had
hung
by
the
desk
her
own
offerings
were
the
furnishings
all
these
were
by
no
means
wedding
gifts
but
afterthoughts
inspired
by
a
careful
inspection
of
the
details
of
doctor
churchill
bachelor
home
and
the
noting
of
certain
gaps
which
only
love
and
care
would
be
likely
to
fill
in
four
hours
now
the
travellers
would
be
at
home
in
time
it
was
expected
for
the
late
dinner
being
prepared
by
hepzibah
fields
for
the
present
at
least
fields
was
to
remain
i
had
full
proof
of
charlotte
ability
to
cook
and
to
manage
a
house
doctor
churchill
had
said
when
they
talked
it
over
and
i
want
her
free
this
first
year
anyway
to
work
with
her
brush
and
pencil
all
she
likes
and
to
go
about
with
me
all
i
like
fields
although
a
product
of
new
england
had
spent
nearly
half
her
life
in
virginia
in
the
service
of
the
churchills
she
had
drawn
a
slow
breath
of
relief
when
this
decision
had
been
made
known
to
her
and
had
said
fervently
to
doctor
churchill
i
expect
i
know
how
to
make
myself
useful
without
being
conspicuous
and
i
sure
i
think
enough
of
both
of
you
not
to
put
my
foot
into
your
housekeeping
that
child
worked
pretty
hard
these
four
years
since
i
known
her
and
a
little
vacation
wo
hurt
her
so
it
had
been
settled
and
fields
was
now
getting
up
a
dinner
for
her
folks
as
she
affectionately
termed
them
which
was
to
be
little
short
of
a
feast
charlotte
had
written
that
she
and
andy
wanted
the
whole
family
to
come
to
dinner
with
them
that
first
night
all
day
celia
and
her
mother
had
been
busy
getting
the
little
house
already
in
perfect
order
into
that
state
of
decorative
cheer
which
suggests
a
welcome
in
itself
now
with
just
offering
of
and
celia
scarlet
carnations
all
about
the
room
a
fire
ready
laid
in
the
fireplace
and
lamps
and
candles
waiting
to
be
lighted
on
every
side
there
seemed
nothing
to
be
desired
i
suppose
there
really
not
another
thing
we
can
do
said
celia
absolutely
nothing
more
that
i
can
see
agreed
birch
taking
up
her
wraps
from
the
chair
on
which
they
lay
you
can
run
over
and
light
up
at
the
last
minute
really
how
long
it
seems
yet
to
seven
does
it
and
how
good
it
will
be
to
get
the
dear
girl
back
well
the
first
month
has
gone
by
mother
dear
the
worst
is
over
celia
spoke
cheerfully
but
her
words
were
not
quite
steady
birch
glanced
at
her
you
been
a
brave
daughter
she
said
with
the
quiet
composure
which
celia
understood
did
not
always
cover
a
peaceful
heart
we
shall
all
grow
used
to
the
change
in
time
i
think
sometimes
we
not
half
thankful
enough
to
have
charlotte
so
near
oh
i
think
we
are
celia
protested
the
children
have
had
a
beautiful
month
have
their
letters
been
what
that
it
was
nothing
more
startling
than
the
front
but
this
was
so
seldom
rung
at
the
bachelor
doctor
house
where
everybody
who
wanted
him
at
all
wanted
him
professionally
at
the
office
that
it
sent
celia
hastily
and
anxiously
to
the
door
it
was
so
impossible
at
this
hour
when
the
travellers
were
almost
home
not
to
dread
the
happening
of
something
to
detain
them
at
the
same
moment
field
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
land
i
do
hope
it
ai
a
telegram
she
observed
in
a
loud
whisper
it
was
not
a
telegram
it
was
a
little
woman
in
black
with
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
beside
her
celia
looked
at
them
questioningly
this
is
doctor
churchill
is
it
asked
the
stranger
with
a
hesitating
foot
upon
the
threshold
is
he
at
home
he
is
expected
home
he
will
be
in
his
office
celia
answered
thinking
this
a
new
patient
and
feeling
justified
in
keeping
doctor
churchill
first
evening
clear
for
him
if
she
could
but
the
visitor
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
came
over
the
threshold
drawing
her
children
with
her
celia
gave
way
but
the
question
in
her
face
brought
the
explanation
i
reckon
it
all
right
if
he
coming
so
soon
i
his
cousin
peyton
these
are
my
children
i
have
seen
andrew
since
he
was
a
boy
at
college
but
he
remember
me
are
you
she
hesitated
birch
came
forward
we
are
the
mother
and
sister
of
churchill
she
said
and
offered
her
hand
doctor
churchill
was
expecting
you
well
maybe
not
just
at
this
time
admitted
the
newcomer
without
reluctance
i
did
know
i
was
coming
myself
until
just
as
i
bought
my
ticket
for
home
i
happened
to
think
i
was
within
sixty
miles
of
that
place
in
the
north
where
i
knew
andrew
settled
so
i
thought
we
better
stop
and
see
him
and
his
new
wife
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
usher
her
in
with
a
rebellious
heart
celia
led
peyton
into
the
and
assisted
her
and
the
children
out
of
their
wrappings
all
sorts
of
strange
ideas
were
occurring
to
her
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
these
people
were
not
what
they
claimed
to
be
she
had
heard
of
such
things
she
was
unwilling
to
show
them
to
charlotte
pretty
to
offer
them
refreshment
even
to
light
the
fire
for
them
it
was
too
bad
it
was
unbearable
that
the
for
which
she
and
her
mother
had
made
such
preparation
should
be
spoiled
by
the
presence
of
these
strangers
to
be
sure
if
she
was
andrew
cousin
she
was
no
stranger
to
him
yet
celia
could
not
recollect
that
he
had
ever
spoken
of
her
even
in
the
most
casual
way
but
her
hope
that
in
some
way
this
might
prove
to
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
was
soon
extinguished
when
she
had
slipped
away
to
the
kitchen
at
a
suggestion
from
her
mother
that
the
guests
should
be
served
with
something
to
eat
she
found
that
information
concerning
peyton
was
to
be
had
from
fields
peyton
for
the
lands
sake
do
tell
me
she
here
know
her
i
guess
i
do
of
all
the
unfortunate
things
to
happen
right
now
i
should
consider
her
about
the
worst
calamity
what
is
she
oh
she
anything
that
about
the
worst
i
can
say
of
her
there
ai
anything
bad
about
her
oh
no
sometimes
i
been
driven
to
wish
there
was
if
i
do
say
it
she
just
what
i
should
call
one
of
them
characterless
sort
of
folks
kind
of
soft
and
silly
like
a
silk
sofy
cushion
without
enough
stuffing
in
it
always
talking
she
is
without
saying
anything
in
particular
i
do
know
about
the
children
they
were
little
things
when
i
saw
last
what
do
you
say
they
look
like
the
girl
is
about
fourteen
i
should
think
said
celia
getting
out
tray
and
napkins
she
rather
a
pretty
child
does
look
very
strong
the
boy
is
quite
a
handsome
fellow
of
nine
or
ten
oh
it
all
right
of
course
and
i
no
doubt
doctor
churchill
will
be
glad
to
see
any
relatives
of
his
family
only
if
it
need
have
happened
just
i
know
how
you
feel
said
the
housekeeper
here
let
me
fix
that
tray
miss
celia
you
done
enough
i
suppose
we
got
to
feed
and
give
a
room
ai
it
too
bad
to
put
them
in
that
nice
spare
room
no
i
do
believe
the
doctor
be
powerful
pleased
to
see
though
i
do
suppose
he
let
on
he
ai
trouble
is
she
a
stayer
one
of
the
visiting
kind
you
know
mis
churchill
mother
used
to
have
her
there
by
the
month
was
what
you
may
call
a
genuine
lady
miss
celia
she
never
let
a
guest
feel
he
welcome
and
i
guess
andy
i
guess
the
doctor
pretty
much
like
her
well
well
fields
sighed
and
celia
echoed
the
sigh
nevertheless
the
little
hint
about
doctor
churchill
mother
took
hold
celia
knew
what
southern
hospitality
meant
if
peyton
had
been
accustomed
to
that
it
must
be
a
matter
of
pride
not
to
let
her
feel
that
northern
homes
were
cold
and
comfortless
places
by
comparison
by
the
time
she
had
shown
the
visitors
to
charlotte
and
had
made
up
a
bed
for
the
boy
on
a
wide
couch
there
celia
had
worked
off
a
little
of
her
regret
nevertheless
when
jeff
and
just
heard
the
news
their
disgust
roused
her
to
fresh
rebellion
i
call
that
pretty
nervy
jeff
declared
indignantly
to
walk
in
on
people
like
this
without
a
word
of
warning
nobody
but
an
idiot
would
expect
people
just
coming
home
from
their
honeymoon
to
want
to
find
their
house
filled
up
with
cousins
oh
andy
relatives
turn
up
now
said
just
cynically
people
he
never
heard
of
i
bet
he
wo
know
this
woman
till
he
introduced
yes
he
will
i
found
her
name
on
the
list
we
sent
announcements
to
celia
said
dismally
i
did
notice
at
the
time
because
there
were
ever
so
many
friends
of
his
people
in
all
parts
of
the
world
randolph
peyton
that
it
hope
randolph
peyton
get
anxious
to
see
her
and
send
for
her
to
come
home
at
once
growled
jeff
she
in
mourning
i
presume
she
a
widow
was
all
the
comfort
celia
could
give
him
then
she
stay
all
winter
cried
just
with
such
hopeless
inflection
that
his
sister
laughed
when
she
went
over
at
half
past
six
to
light
the
fire
she
found
the
three
visitors
gathered
in
the
she
had
hoped
they
might
stay
at
least
until
the
first
welcome
had
been
given
to
charlotte
and
andrew
but
it
turned
out
that
peyton
had
inquired
of
fields
the
exact
hour
of
the
expected
arrival
and
presumably
had
considered
that
since
the
peytons
represented
doctor
churchill
side
of
the
house
their
part
in
his
welcome
home
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
birch
jeff
just
and
birch
with
little
ellen
presently
appeared
lansing
had
gone
back
to
his
law
school
but
a
great
bunch
of
roses
represented
him
it
had
been
charlotte
express
command
that
nobody
should
go
to
the
station
to
meet
the
returning
travellers
but
that
everybody
should
be
in
the
little
brick
house
to
welcome
them
when
they
should
drive
up
here
they
are
here
they
are
shouted
just
from
behind
a
window
curtain
where
he
had
been
keeping
close
watch
on
the
circle
of
radiance
from
the
nearest
there
was
a
rush
for
the
door
jeff
flung
it
open
and
he
and
just
raced
to
the
hansom
which
was
driving
up
the
rest
of
the
party
crowded
the
doorway
peyton
and
lucy
and
randolph
being
of
the
group
how
are
you
everybody
called
doctor
churchill
eager
voice
as
he
and
charlotte
ran
up
the
walk
to
the
door
jeff
and
just
following
well
this
is
fine
father
mother
celia
my
little
ellen
bless
your
hearts
but
it
good
to
see
you
how
could
anybody
help
loving
a
like
that
one
would
have
thought
they
were
indeed
his
own
while
charlotte
remained
wrapped
in
her
mother
embrace
doctor
churchill
was
greeting
them
all
twice
over
with
apparently
no
eyes
for
the
three
he
had
not
expected
to
see
for
the
moment
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
recognized
them
and
supposed
them
to
be
strangers
to
whom
he
would
presently
be
made
known
but
now
as
somebody
moved
aside
and
the
light
struck
upon
her
he
caught
the
smile
on
peyton
face
he
left
off
shaking
jeff
hand
and
made
a
quick
movement
toward
the
little
figure
in
black
why
cousin
lula
he
exclaimed
charlotte
at
the
moment
hugging
little
ellen
with
laughter
and
kisses
turned
at
the
cry
and
saw
her
husband
greeting
with
great
cordiality
these
strange
people
whom
she
too
had
supposed
to
be
the
guests
of
her
mother
charlotte
said
doctor
churchill
turning
about
this
is
my
cousin
peyton
of
virginia
and
her
children
charlotte
came
forward
cordially
greeted
peyton
and
lucy
and
randolph
and
led
them
into
the
as
if
the
moment
were
that
of
their
arrival
instead
of
her
own
she
has
the
stuff
in
her
has
she
murmured
just
to
jeff
as
the
two
stood
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
could
you
ever
doubt
it
returned
jeff
with
as
much
emphasis
as
can
be
put
into
a
mumbled
retort
jeff
had
been
charlotte
staunchest
champion
all
his
life
ah
fieldsy
but
i
glad
to
be
back
doctor
churchill
assured
his
housekeeper
in
the
kitchen
to
which
he
had
soon
found
his
way
had
a
glorious
time
down
in
the
virginia
mountains
but
this
is
home
now
as
it
never
was
before
and
it
great
fun
to
be
here
how
are
you
you
looking
fine
and
i
feeling
fine
assented
fields
her
spare
face
lighted
into
something
like
real
comeliness
by
the
pleasure
in
her
heart
just
one
thing
doctor
andy
i
terrible
sorry
them
relatives
of
yours
happened
along
just
now
if
i
gone
to
the
door
well
i
do
believe
but
i
have
seen
my
way
clear
to
churchill
shook
his
head
smiling
no
fieldsy
you
know
you
would
besides
cousin
lula
looks
far
from
well
and
she
had
a
lot
of
trouble
it
all
right
you
know
my
but
this
is
a
good
dinner
we
have
coming
to
us
he
went
off
gaily
fields
looked
after
him
affectionately
oh
yes
andy
churchill
it
plain
to
be
seen
your
heart
in
the
right
place
as
much
as
ever
it
was
if
you
have
got
married
she
thought
o
fieldsy
and
this
time
it
was
charlotte
who
invaded
the
kitchen
and
grasped
the
housekeeper
hands
how
good
it
seems
to
be
back
but
i
ca
realise
a
bit
i
at
home
over
here
can
you
you
soon
get
used
to
it
i
guess
mis
churchill
oh
and
sounds
strange
from
you
declared
charlotte
laughing
i
begun
to
get
a
little
bit
used
to
it
down
in
virginia
if
you
say
charlotte
once
in
a
while
to
me
i
shall
feel
quite
lost
i
guess
doctor
churchill
have
something
to
say
about
that
if
i
should
i
do
believe
but
what
he
terrible
proud
of
that
name
it
was
certainly
a
name
nobody
seemed
able
to
get
used
to
just
called
his
sister
by
the
new
title
once
during
the
evening
they
were
at
the
table
when
he
thus
addressed
her
and
there
followed
a
succession
of
comments
do
you
dare
call
her
that
when
i
round
remarked
jeff
i
actually
did
understand
at
first
whom
you
meant
said
celia
i
not
forgotten
how
long
it
took
me
to
learn
that
my
name
was
birch
said
charlotte
mother
with
a
smile
so
bright
that
it
covered
the
involuntary
sigh
is
aunty
charlotte
my
aunty
churchill
now
piped
little
ellen
lucy
and
randolph
peyton
laughed
of
course
she
is
dumpling
only
you
can
keep
on
calling
her
aunty
charlotte
and
i
your
uncle
andy
how
do
you
like
that
oh
i
like
that
agreed
ellen
and
edged
her
chair
an
inch
nearer
uncle
andy
dinner
over
celia
bore
ellen
home
to
bed
charlotte
suggested
the
same
possibility
for
the
peyton
children
but
although
it
was
nearing
nine
both
refused
so
decidedly
that
after
a
glance
at
their
mother
who
took
no
notice
charlotte
said
no
more
randolph
grew
sleepy
in
his
chair
and
doctor
churchill
presently
took
pity
on
him
he
sat
down
beside
the
lad
and
told
him
a
story
of
so
intentionally
monotonous
a
character
that
randolph
was
soon
half
over
the
border
then
the
doctor
picked
him
up
and
with
the
drooping
head
on
his
shoulder
observed
pleasantly
this
lad
wants
his
bed
cousin
lula
may
i
take
him
to
it
peyton
engaged
in
telling
birch
her
opinion
of
certain
northern
institutions
she
had
lately
observed
nodded
absently
doctor
churchill
ascended
the
stairs
and
charlotte
slipping
from
the
room
ran
up
ahead
of
him
to
get
randolph
cot
in
readiness
that
it
old
fellow
wake
up
enough
to
let
me
get
your
clothes
off
churchill
bade
the
child
can
you
find
his
nightclothes
charlotte
cousin
lula
seems
to
have
unpacked
that
it
thank
you
now
ran
you
be
glad
to
be
in
bed
wo
you
can
you
wake
up
enough
to
say
your
prayers
son
no
well
that
not
altogether
your
fault
he
said
softly
and
smiled
at
charlotte
i
think
we
better
invite
lucy
up
too
do
you
wo
she
peyton
think
we
rather
cool
charlotte
suggested
as
they
tucked
the
boy
in
not
a
bit
she
be
glad
to
have
the
job
off
her
hands
the
youngsters
are
tired
and
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
an
hour
ago
stay
here
and
i
run
down
after
lucy
on
the
stairs
as
they
descended
after
charlotte
had
seen
lucy
to
her
quarters
they
met
jeff
been
putting
the
kids
to
bed
he
questioned
curiously
under
his
breath
well
you
great
their
mother
does
seem
much
worried
about
it
she
quite
a
talker
guess
she
did
notice
what
happened
say
i
going
it
ten
you
two
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
look
without
any
more
company
justin
slipped
off
while
you
were
told
me
to
say
father
and
mother
are
only
waiting
for
a
pause
in
your
cousin
conversation
long
enough
to
throw
in
a
word
of
their
own
before
they
get
up
he
made
an
expressive
gesture
you
know
mother
invariable
rule
he
chuckled
never
to
get
up
to
go
at
the
end
of
one
of
your
guest
conversational
sprints
but
always
to
wait
until
you
can
interrupt
yourself
so
to
speak
well
i
do
mean
any
disrespect
to
the
lady
from
virginia
andy
but
i
afraid
have
to
make
an
exception
to
that
rule
or
else
remain
for
the
night
the
three
laughed
softly
charlotte
hand
on
her
brother
shoulder
as
she
stood
on
the
step
above
him
you
must
say
any
saucy
things
jeffy
said
she
with
a
soft
touch
on
his
thick
locks
i
wo
i
too
tickled
to
have
you
back
both
of
you
we
missed
fiddle
pretty
badly
he
said
to
doctor
churchill
but
we
found
time
to
miss
you
almost
as
much
there
have
been
several
times
while
you
been
gone
that
i
have
welcomed
the
of
your
runabout
under
my
window
waking
me
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thank
you
old
fellow
said
doctor
churchill
with
a
hand
on
other
shoulder
that
mighty
pleasant
to
hear
in
spite
of
jeff
prediction
birch
soon
managed
in
her
own
tactful
way
to
follow
her
sons
home
peyton
went
up
to
her
room
at
last
a
cordial
good
night
following
her
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
then
doctor
churchill
drew
his
wife
back
into
the
and
closed
the
doors
he
stood
looking
at
charlotte
with
eyes
in
which
were
mingled
merriment
and
tenderness
it
was
just
as
we
planned
it
was
it
little
girl
he
said
but
there
always
this
to
fall
back
upon
people
we
want
and
people
we
do
want
so
much
may
be
around
us
to
the
right
of
us
and
the
left
of
us
but
even
so
nobody
can
ever
come
between
the
rang
oh
i
hoped
nobody
would
know
you
were
home
cried
charlotte
the
smile
fading
from
her
lips
doctor
churchill
went
quickly
to
the
door
a
messenger
boy
with
a
telegram
stood
outside
the
doctor
read
the
dispatch
and
dismissed
the
boy
then
he
turned
to
charlotte
no
it
no
bad
news
he
said
and
came
close
it
just
can
you
bear
up
another
impending
guest
charlotte
i
done
a
lot
of
talking
about
hospitality
and
i
meant
it
all
i
certainly
want
our
always
out
but
you
think
we
rushed
that
copper
motto
into
place
just
a
bit
too
chapter
iii
charlotte
what
are
we
going
to
do
it
turns
out
lee
has
his
sister
with
him
andrew
churchill
engaged
in
making
up
a
fresh
bed
with
linen
smelling
faintly
of
lavender
dropped
her
sheets
and
blankets
and
stood
up
straight
she
gazed
across
the
room
at
andy
whose
face
expressed
both
amusement
and
dismay
andy
said
she
have
i
somewhere
heard
a
proverb
to
the
effect
that
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
there
an
impression
on
my
mind
that
you
have
said
her
husband
you
are
now
about
to
have
a
practical
demonstration
of
that
same
proverb
i
wrote
lee
as
you
suggested
after
his
second
telegram
and
this
is
his
answer
he
was
detained
by
the
illness
of
his
sister
evelyn
who
is
with
him
it
seems
she
was
at
school
up
here
in
our
state
but
overworked
and
finally
broke
down
and
he
has
come
to
take
her
home
but
you
see
home
for
them
means
a
the
family
is
broken
up
mother
dead
father
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
lee
has
evelyn
on
his
hands
the
worst
of
it
is
he
wants
me
to
see
her
professionally
so
i
ca
very
well
suggest
that
we
too
full
to
entertain
her
of
course
you
ca
agreed
charlotte
promptly
but
it
means
that
we
must
find
another
room
somewhere
in
the
house
of
course
mother
would
but
i
do
want
to
begin
right
away
to
send
extra
guests
over
there
neither
do
i
said
doctor
churchill
do
you
suppose
we
could
put
a
cot
into
my
private
office
for
lee
then
the
sister
could
have
this
how
old
is
she
sixteen
he
says
oh
then
this
will
do
and
we
can
put
a
cot
in
your
private
office
after
office
hours
if
lee
is
an
old
friend
he
wo
object
to
anything
you
a
dear
girl
and
they
wo
stay
long
of
course
especially
when
they
see
how
crowded
we
are
you
like
thorne
lee
charlotte
he
one
of
the
best
fellows
alive
i
have
seen
the
sister
since
she
was
a
small
child
but
if
she
anything
like
her
brother
you
have
no
trouble
entertaining
her
sick
or
well
all
right
i
answer
letter
and
say
nothing
about
our
being
of
course
not
that
would
be
hospitality
when
will
they
come
in
a
day
or
two
as
soon
as
she
feels
like
travelling
again
i
be
ready
for
her
and
charlotte
gave
him
her
brightest
smile
as
he
hurried
off
she
finished
her
put
the
little
room
set
apart
for
her
own
private
den
into
condition
as
nearly
as
it
was
possible
to
do
with
articles
of
furniture
borrowed
from
next
door
and
went
down
to
break
the
news
to
fields
she
found
that
person
explaining
with
grim
patience
to
the
peyton
children
why
they
could
not
make
candy
in
her
kitchen
at
the
inopportune
hour
of
ten
in
the
morning
but
we
always
do
at
home
complained
lucy
with
a
frown
like
as
not
you
do
clear
up
the
muss
afterward
either
suggested
fields
with
a
sharp
look
course
we
do
randolph
asserted
with
a
curl
of
his
handsome
upper
lip
what
servants
for
i
like
to
know
to
make
friends
with
not
to
treat
impolitely
said
a
clear
voice
behind
the
boy
randolph
and
lucy
turned
quickly
and
fields
face
which
had
grown
grim
softened
perceptibly
both
children
looked
ready
to
make
some
tart
reply
to
charlotte
interpolation
but
as
their
eyes
fell
upon
her
they
discovered
that
to
be
impossible
how
could
one
speak
rudely
when
one
met
that
kind
but
authoritative
glance
this
is
fields
busiest
time
you
know
charlotte
said
and
it
would
do
to
bother
her
now
with
making
candy
in
the
afternoon
help
you
make
it
come
suppose
we
go
for
a
walk
i
some
marketing
to
do
ran
can
go
with
you
said
lucy
as
charlotte
proceeded
to
make
ready
for
the
trip
it
too
cold
for
me
i
rather
stay
here
by
the
fire
and
read
charlotte
looked
at
her
lucy
delicate
face
was
paler
than
usual
this
morning
she
had
a
languid
air
the
walk
in
this
fresh
november
breeze
will
be
sure
to
make
you
feel
ever
so
much
better
said
charlotte
do
you
think
so
cousin
lula
peyton
looked
up
reluctantly
from
her
embroidery
why
i
would
urge
her
charlotte
if
she
does
want
to
go
she
said
with
a
glance
at
lucy
who
was
leaning
back
in
a
big
chair
with
a
discontented
expression
you
must
expect
people
from
the
south
to
enjoy
your
freezing
weather
as
you
seem
to
lucy
feels
the
cold
very
much
charlotte
and
randolph
marched
away
down
the
street
together
the
boy
as
full
of
spirits
as
his
companion
she
had
found
it
easy
from
the
first
to
make
friends
with
him
and
was
beginning
in
spite
of
certain
rather
unpleasant
qualities
of
his
to
like
him
very
much
his
mother
had
done
her
best
to
spoil
him
yet
the
child
showed
plainly
that
there
was
in
him
the
material
for
a
sturdy
strong
character
when
charlotte
had
made
several
small
purchases
at
the
market
she
did
not
offer
to
give
randolph
the
little
wicker
basket
she
carried
but
the
boy
took
it
from
her
with
a
smile
and
a
proud
air
ran
said
charlotte
just
round
this
corner
there
a
jolly
hill
i
do
believe
anybody
will
mind
if
we
have
a
race
down
it
do
you
it
was
a
back
street
and
the
hill
was
an
inviting
one
the
two
had
their
race
and
randolph
won
by
a
yard
just
as
the
pair
laughing
and
panting
slowed
down
into
their
ordinary
pace
a
runabout
driven
by
a
smiling
young
man
in
a
heavy
ulster
and
cap
turned
the
corner
with
a
rush
amid
a
cloud
of
steam
the
motor
came
to
a
standstill
aha
caught
you
at
it
cried
doctor
churchill
came
down
that
hill
faster
than
the
law
allows
get
in
here
both
of
you
and
take
the
run
out
to
the
hospital
with
me
i
shall
not
be
there
long
i
been
out
once
this
morning
this
is
just
to
make
sure
of
a
case
i
operated
on
two
hours
ago
shall
we
ran
asked
charlotte
oh
let
said
the
boy
with
enthusiasm
so
away
they
went
the
result
of
the
expedition
came
out
later
in
the
day
before
dinner
the
entire
household
was
grouped
about
the
fire
doctor
churchill
having
just
come
in
after
one
of
his
busiest
days
been
out
to
the
hospital
again
cousin
andy
ran
asked
yes
twice
since
the
noon
visit
how
was
the
little
boy
with
the
broken
waist
fractured
hip
just
about
as
you
saw
him
he
got
to
be
patient
a
good
while
before
he
can
walk
again
and
these
first
few
days
are
hard
he
asked
me
when
you
would
come
again
oh
i
go
cried
randolph
sitting
up
very
straight
on
his
cushion
and
i
take
him
a
book
i
got
with
splendid
pictures
good
doctor
churchill
laid
a
hand
on
the
boy
thick
locks
that
will
please
him
immensely
peyton
was
looking
at
him
with
dismay
do
i
understand
you
have
taken
him
to
a
hospital
she
asked
doctor
churchill
nodded
to
the
boys
surgical
ward
nothing
contagious
admitted
to
the
hospital
it
a
wonderful
pleasure
to
the
little
chaps
to
see
a
boy
from
outside
and
ran
enjoyed
it
too
did
you
oh
it
was
jolly
said
the
boy
i
should
think
that
was
exactly
the
word
to
describe
such
a
spot
said
peyton
and
she
looked
displeased
i
think
there
are
quite
enough
sad
sights
in
the
world
for
his
young
eyes
without
taking
him
into
the
midst
of
suffering
i
should
not
have
permitted
it
if
you
had
consulted
me
it
was
true
that
doctor
churchill
possessed
a
frank
and
boyish
face
wearing
ordinarily
an
exceedingly
genial
expression
but
the
friendly
gray
eyes
were
capable
of
turning
steely
upon
provocation
and
they
turned
that
way
now
he
returned
his
cousin
look
with
one
which
concealed
with
some
difficulty
both
surprise
and
disgust
i
took
ran
nowhere
that
he
would
see
any
extreme
suffering
he
explained
this
ward
contains
only
convalescents
from
various
injuries
and
operations
the
graver
cases
are
elsewhere
and
he
saw
nothing
of
those
a
visit
to
this
ward
is
likely
to
excite
sympathy
it
is
true
but
not
sympathy
of
a
painful
sort
the
boys
have
very
good
times
among
themselves
after
a
limited
fashion
and
i
think
ran
had
a
good
time
with
them
how
about
it
ran
oh
i
did
i
taught
two
of
to
play
their
legs
were
hurt
but
their
hands
were
all
right
and
they
could
play
as
well
as
anybody
they
liked
it
nevertheless
randolph
is
of
a
very
sensitive
and
delicate
pursued
his
mother
and
i
do
think
such
associations
good
for
him
he
moaned
in
his
sleep
last
night
and
i
could
think
what
it
could
be
it
could
have
been
the
candy
we
made
this
afternoon
could
it
cousin
lula
charlotte
asked
in
her
gentlest
way
a
comprehending
smile
touched
the
corners
of
doctor
churchill
lips
why
of
course
not
said
peyton
quickly
candy
made
this
afternoon
how
absurd
charlotte
it
was
last
night
his
sleep
was
disturbed
but
the
hospital
visit
was
this
morning
charlotte
said
i
should
think
the
one
might
as
easily
be
responsible
as
the
other
peyton
looked
confused
i
understood
you
to
say
the
visit
to
the
hospital
occurred
yesterday
she
said
with
dignity
and
doctor
churchill
smothered
his
amusement
i
certainly
do
not
approve
of
taking
children
to
such
places
she
repeated
charlotte
adroitly
turned
the
conversation
into
other
channels
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
hospitals
just
then
only
the
boy
when
he
had
a
chance
whispered
in
doctor
churchill
ear
you
just
wait
i
tease
her
into
it
his
cousin
smiled
back
at
him
and
shook
his
head
teasing
a
mighty
poor
way
of
getting
things
ran
he
said
leave
it
to
me
toward
the
end
of
the
following
day
jeff
crossing
the
lawn
at
his
usual
rapid
pace
was
hailed
from
doctor
churchill
office
door
by
fields
the
housekeeper
waved
a
telegram
as
he
approached
here
jeff
said
she
would
you
mind
opening
this
there
ai
a
soul
in
the
house
and
i
do
want
to
take
such
a
liberty
but
it
ought
to
be
read
i
make
no
manner
of
doubt
it
from
those
extry
visitors
that
are
coming
where
are
they
all
jeff
fingered
the
envelope
reluctantly
i
like
opening
other
people
messages
i
do
know
where
they
are
that
it
doctor
took
miss
charlotte
and
ranny
off
after
lunch
in
his
machine
and
mis
peyton
and
lucy
have
gone
to
town
with
your
mother
doctor
andy
would
like
it
if
his
friends
came
without
anybody
to
meet
jeff
tore
open
the
dispatch
the
first
two
words
will
tell
me
i
suppose
he
said
hello
yes
you
right
they
be
here
on
the
that
he
pulled
out
his
watch
why
there
barely
time
to
get
to
the
station
now
this
must
have
been
delayed
you
say
you
know
where
anybody
is
not
a
soul
doctor
usually
leaves
word
but
he
did
this
time
i
telephone
the
hospital
and
jeff
hurried
to
doctor
desk
in
a
minute
he
had
learned
that
the
doctor
had
come
and
gone
for
the
last
time
that
day
he
looked
at
fields
you
have
to
go
jeff
said
she
i
know
doctor
andy
ways
he
as
soon
let
company
go
without
their
dinners
as
not
be
on
hand
when
their
train
came
in
he
was
expecting
the
lees
till
of
course
said
jeff
i
go
since
there
nobody
else
how
am
i
to
know
young
man
and
sick
girl
all
right
that
easy
and
he
was
off
to
catch
a
car
at
the
corner
as
he
rode
into
town
however
he
was
rebelling
against
the
situation
this
guest
business
is
being
overdone
he
observed
to
himself
these
people
are
probably
some
more
off
the
peyton
piece
of
cloth
an
invalid
girl
lying
round
on
couches
for
fiddle
to
wait
on
another
lucy
probably
only
worse
because
she
well
i
not
going
to
be
any
more
cordial
than
the
law
calls
for
i
have
to
bring
out
in
a
carriage
i
suppose
she
be
too
limp
for
the
trolley
he
reached
the
station
barely
in
time
to
engage
a
carriage
before
the
train
came
in
he
took
up
his
position
inside
the
gates
through
which
all
passengers
must
pass
from
the
into
the
great
station
looking
for
somebody
asked
a
voice
at
his
elbow
he
glanced
quickly
down
at
one
of
his
old
schoolmates
carolyn
houghton
yes
guests
of
the
churchills
he
answered
his
gaze
instantly
returning
to
the
throng
pouring
toward
him
from
the
train
help
me
will
you
i
do
know
them
from
adam
it
a
man
and
his
invalid
sister
old
friends
of
andy
there
they
are
said
carolyn
promptly
indicating
an
approaching
pair
jeff
laughed
the
sister
is
quite
so
antique
as
that
he
objected
as
a
little
woman
of
fifty
wavered
past
on
the
arm
of
a
stout
gentleman
you
said
friends
retorted
carolyn
look
jeff
is
that
she
the
sister
being
wheeled
in
a
chair
by
a
porter
the
brother
walking
beside
her
they
like
doctor
churchill
friends
jeff
think
you
can
tell
andy
friends
by
their
uniform
you
can
tell
anybody
intimate
friends
in
a
crowd
i
mean
the
same
kind
of
people
look
alike
asserted
carolyn
with
emphasis
these
are
the
ones
i
sure
i
just
watch
while
you
greet
them
and
then
slip
off
i
taking
this
next
train
what
a
sweet
face
that
girl
has
but
how
delicate
like
a
little
flower
she
a
dear
i
sure
the
brother
looks
nice
too
they
the
ones
i
know
see
the
looking
hard
at
us
all
inside
the
gates
here
goes
then
jeff
turned
away
to
the
task
of
making
himself
known
to
the
strangers
but
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
if
charlotte
must
meet
another
onslaught
of
visitors
these
certainly
did
look
attractive
yes
i
thorne
lee
the
young
man
answered
with
a
straight
look
into
jeff
eyes
and
a
grasp
of
the
outstretched
hand
as
jeff
introduced
himself
he
motioned
the
porter
to
wheel
the
chair
out
of
the
pressing
crowd
jeff
explained
about
the
delayed
telegram
lee
presented
him
to
the
young
girl
in
the
chair
and
jeff
looked
down
into
a
pair
of
hazel
eyes
which
instantly
claimed
his
sympathy
the
shadows
of
fatigue
lay
on
them
so
heavily
but
miss
evelyn
lee
smile
was
bright
if
fleeting
and
she
answered
jeff
announcement
that
he
had
a
carriage
waiting
with
so
appreciative
a
word
of
gratitude
that
he
found
his
preconceived
antipathy
to
doctor
churchill
guests
slipping
away
so
presently
he
had
them
in
a
carriage
and
bowling
through
the
streets
which
led
toward
the
suburbs
thorne
lee
sat
beside
his
sister
supporting
her
and
talked
with
jeff
by
the
time
they
had
covered
the
long
drive
to
the
house
jeff
was
hoping
lee
would
stay
a
month
the
hazel
eyes
of
lee
young
sister
had
closed
and
the
lashes
lay
wearily
sweeping
the
pale
cheeks
as
the
carriage
drove
up
are
we
there
lee
asked
bending
over
the
slight
figure
open
your
eyes
dear
jeff
jumped
out
and
ran
to
the
house
he
burst
in
upon
charlotte
and
andy
your
friends
are
here
he
shouted
i
had
to
meet
myself
doctor
churchill
and
charlotte
were
at
the
door
before
the
words
were
out
of
jeff
mouth
and
in
a
moment
more
andy
was
lifting
evelyn
light
figure
in
his
arms
thanking
heaven
inwardly
as
he
did
so
for
his
young
wife
wholesome
weight
at
the
same
moment
words
of
of
eager
cheery
welcome
for
his
old
friend
were
on
his
lips
thorne
lee
i
gladder
to
see
you
than
anybody
in
the
world
miss
evelyn
here
churchill
she
not
an
old
married
woman
at
all
she
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
she
going
to
seem
to
you
like
one
of
your
schoolfellows
charlotte
here
she
is
take
good
care
of
her
thorne
lee
stood
looking
on
a
relieved
smile
on
his
lips
as
his
old
friend
wife
took
his
sick
little
sister
into
her
charge
it
was
not
two
minutes
before
he
saw
evelyn
lying
pale
and
mute
on
the
couch
yet
smiling
up
at
charlotte
bright
young
face
charlotte
administered
a
cup
of
hot
bouillon
talking
so
engagingly
meanwhile
that
evelyn
was
beguiled
into
taking
without
protest
the
whole
of
the
nourishment
then
he
saw
the
young
invalid
carried
off
to
bed
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
meeting
any
more
members
of
the
household
he
learned
as
charlotte
slipped
into
the
room
after
an
hour
absence
that
evelyn
had
already
dropped
off
to
sleep
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
long
breath
what
kind
of
a
girl
is
this
you
married
andy
he
asked
with
a
smile
and
a
look
from
one
to
the
other
the
three
were
alone
peyton
and
her
children
having
gone
out
to
some
sort
of
entertainment
just
what
she
seems
to
be
replied
doctor
churchill
smiling
back
and
a
thousand
times
more
i
might
have
known
you
would
care
for
no
other
lee
said
and
you
two
in
your
house
at
the
side
of
the
road
to
be
good
friends
to
man
if
i
may
adapt
those
homely
words
we
have
been
at
it
very
long
but
we
hope
to
realize
an
ambition
of
the
sort
it
does
take
much
philanthropy
to
welcome
you
you
ca
think
what
a
relief
it
is
to
me
to
get
that
little
sister
of
mine
under
your
wing
even
for
a
few
hours
tell
us
all
about
her
lee
had
not
meant
to
begin
at
once
upon
his
troubles
but
his
friend
drew
him
on
and
before
the
evening
ended
the
doctor
and
charlotte
had
the
whole
long
hard
story
of
lee
guardianship
of
several
young
brothers
and
sisters
his
struggle
to
get
established
in
his
profession
and
make
money
for
their
support
his
many
anxieties
in
the
process
and
this
culminating
trouble
in
the
breakdown
of
the
younger
sister
just
as
he
thought
he
had
her
safely
established
in
a
school
where
she
might
have
a
happy
home
for
several
years
lee
stopped
suddenly
as
if
he
had
hardly
known
how
long
he
had
been
talking
i
a
pleasant
guest
he
said
regret
in
his
tone
i
meant
to
tell
you
briefly
the
history
of
evelyn
illness
and
here
i
gone
on
unloading
all
my
burdens
of
years
what
do
you
sit
there
looking
so
benevolent
and
sympathetic
for
beguiling
a
fellow
into
making
a
fool
of
himself
my
worries
are
no
greater
than
those
of
millions
of
other
people
and
here
i
been
laying
it
on
with
a
trowel
forget
the
whole
dismal
story
and
just
give
me
a
bit
of
professional
advice
about
my
little
sister
look
here
old
boy
said
his
friend
do
go
talking
that
way
you
done
just
what
i
was
anxious
you
should
do
given
me
your
confidence
i
can
go
at
your
sister
case
with
a
better
chance
of
understanding
it
if
i
know
this
whole
story
and
now
i
going
to
thank
you
and
send
you
off
to
bed
for
a
good
night
sleep
take
evelyn
in
hand
bless
you
andy
you
the
same
old
tried
and
true
murmured
thorne
lee
shaking
hands
warmly
then
charlotte
led
him
away
to
see
his
sister
who
had
waked
and
wanted
him
stooping
over
her
bed
he
felt
a
pair
of
slender
arms
round
his
neck
and
heard
her
voice
whispering
in
his
ear
thorny
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
think
churchill
is
the
dearest
person
i
ever
saw
and
i
going
to
sleep
better
than
i
have
for
weeks
thank
god
for
that
thought
lee
and
kissed
the
thin
cheek
of
the
girl
with
brotherly
fervor
in
the
hall
a
few
minutes
later
andrew
churchill
advanced
to
meet
his
wife
as
she
returned
to
him
after
ministering
to
evelyn
wants
do
you
know
said
he
looking
straight
down
into
her
eyes
as
she
came
up
to
him
those
words
of
stevenson
though
they
always
fit
you
seem
particularly
applicable
to
you
and
the
great
artificer
made
my
mate
chapter
iv
i
think
said
doctor
churchill
leaning
back
in
his
office
chair
with
a
mingling
of
the
professional
and
the
friendly
in
his
air
that
we
can
get
at
the
bottom
of
evelyn
troubles
without
very
much
difficulty
he
had
just
sent
evelyn
back
to
charlotte
after
an
hour
in
the
office
during
which
he
had
subjected
her
to
a
minute
and
painstaking
examination
into
the
cause
of
her
ill
health
and
now
to
her
brother
anxiously
awaiting
his
verdict
he
spoke
his
mind
if
you
let
me
be
very
frank
with
you
thorne
he
said
i
tell
you
just
what
i
think
about
evelyn
and
just
what
it
seems
to
me
is
the
proper
course
for
us
to
take
with
her
go
ahead
it
exactly
that
i
want
lee
declared
i
know
well
enough
that
my
care
of
her
has
been
seriously
at
fault
never
in
intention
said
doctor
churchill
only
in
the
excess
of
your
tenderness
evelyn
has
lived
in
overheated
rooms
with
hot
baths
insufficient
exercise
and
improper
food
in
the
kindness
of
your
heart
you
have
been
nourishing
a
little
plant
and
there
no
occasion
for
surprise
that
it
wilts
at
the
first
blast
of
ordinary
air
lee
looked
dismayed
i
mighty
sorry
andy
he
said
remorsefully
do
feel
too
badly
was
his
friend
reply
after
a
winter
with
us
evelyn
will
be
another
girl
what
lee
started
in
his
chair
andy
what
are
you
thinking
about
just
what
i
say
charlotte
and
i
have
talked
it
all
over
we
both
taken
an
immense
liking
to
evelyn
and
we
honestly
enjoy
having
her
here
for
the
winter
it
only
remains
for
you
to
convince
evelyn
herself
that
we
are
to
be
trusted
and
to
secure
her
promise
that
we
may
have
our
way
with
her
from
first
to
last
and
the
thing
is
done
you
are
sure
that
really
all
there
is
to
it
you
not
keeping
anything
from
me
not
a
thing
and
i
as
sure
as
a
man
can
well
be
that
why
i
prescribe
a
sanatorium
for
her
or
anything
of
that
sort
all
she
needs
is
a
rational
life
of
the
kind
such
as
charlotte
and
i
can
teach
her
charlotte
even
more
effectively
than
evelyn
needs
simply
to
build
up
a
strong
physical
body
then
these
troublesome
nerves
will
take
care
of
themselves
believe
me
thorne
it
refreshingly
simple
i
not
even
a
drug
to
suggest
for
your
sister
she
does
need
any
but
andy
it
does
seem
to
me
i
can
let
evelyn
stay
here
with
you
all
winter
the
first
winter
of
your
married
life
you
two
ought
to
be
alone
together
no
charlotte
and
i
have
set
out
to
go
through
life
even
this
first
year
of
it
alone
together
we
are
together
no
matter
how
many
we
have
about
us
it
will
be
only
in
the
day
work
if
we
keep
evelyn
with
us
and
it
a
sort
of
work
that
will
pay
pretty
well
i
fancy
it
certainly
will
in
more
than
one
kind
of
coin
and
lee
gripped
his
friend
hand
so
it
was
settled
evelyn
agreed
so
joyously
to
the
plan
that
her
brother
last
doubt
of
its
feasibility
was
removed
and
he
went
away
a
day
later
with
a
heart
so
much
lighter
than
the
one
he
had
brought
with
him
that
it
showed
in
his
whole
bearing
god
bless
you
and
your
sweet
wife
andy
churchill
he
wrote
back
from
his
first
and
when
churchill
showed
the
letter
to
charlotte
she
said
happily
we
make
the
copper
motto
come
true
with
this
guest
wo
we
evelyn
will
be
a
very
pretty
girl
when
she
loses
that
fragile
look
her
eyes
and
expression
are
beautiful
do
you
know
she
accepts
everything
i
say
as
if
i
were
the
goddess
of
wisdom
herself
charlotte
said
peyton
a
few
days
later
coming
hurriedly
into
charlotte
own
room
where
that
young
woman
was
busy
with
various
housewifely
offices
i
had
a
telegram
i
so
upset
i
do
know
what
to
do
my
sister
is
sick
and
her
husband
is
away
and
she
sent
for
me
i
not
able
to
do
nursing
i
not
strong
enough
but
i
see
but
that
i
must
go
i
very
sorry
your
sister
is
ill
said
charlotte
tell
me
about
her
peyton
told
at
length
and
what
i
to
do
with
the
children
she
said
mournfully
i
do
know
sister
does
want
them
to
come
but
here
i
away
up
north
and
sister
out
west
and
the
children
go
home
alone
besides
there
nowhere
for
them
to
go
i
am
their
only
home
dear
dear
what
shall
i
do
the
front
ringing
sharply
sent
charlotte
at
this
moment
she
saw
her
husband
coming
up
the
street
in
his
runabout
when
doctor
churchill
ran
into
his
office
after
a
case
of
instruments
he
had
forgotten
his
wife
cast
herself
into
his
arms
in
such
a
state
of
emotion
that
he
held
her
close
bewildered
what
on
earth
is
it
dear
he
asked
are
you
laughing
or
crying
here
let
me
see
your
face
o
andy
charlotte
would
not
let
her
face
be
seen
it
cousin
lula
she
she
oh
she
churchill
burst
into
smothered
laughter
it
ca
be
you
crying
he
murmured
charlotte
i
do
blame
you
look
up
and
smile
i
know
how
you
must
be
feeling
you
been
a
regular
heroine
all
these
weeks
i
awfully
ashamed
choked
charlotte
on
his
shoulder
but
o
andy
what
it
will
seem
not
to
have
to
oh
i
must
say
it
but
i
know
i
know
he
patted
her
shoulder
her
sister
is
ill
in
the
west
somewhere
she
has
to
go
to
her
at
once
she
wants
the
children
to
stay
with
us
she
does
her
sister
does
want
them
there
and
she
ca
send
them
home
andy
i
would
mind
that
so
awfully
i
almost
like
the
chance
to
see
what
we
could
do
with
them
well
do
answer
definitely
till
i
have
time
to
talk
it
over
with
you
and
with
her
i
must
go
now
they
talked
it
over
together
and
with
peyton
the
result
of
these
conferences
was
that
two
days
later
that
lady
took
her
departure
leaving
her
children
in
the
care
of
the
churchills
on
one
condition
cousin
lula
doctor
churchill
had
said
to
her
with
decision
that
you
put
them
absolutely
in
our
care
and
trust
our
judgment
in
the
management
of
them
peyton
tried
to
make
a
few
reservations
her
cousin
would
have
none
of
them
at
last
she
submitted
understanding
well
enough
in
her
heart
that
andrew
churchill
would
be
the
safest
sort
of
a
guardian
for
her
children
and
admitting
to
herself
if
she
did
not
to
anybody
else
that
charlotte
would
give
them
care
of
the
sort
which
money
can
not
buy
that
woman
gone
asked
jeff
coming
into
his
sister
celia
room
well
i
delighted
to
hear
it
but
i
must
say
i
think
taken
a
good
deal
of
a
contract
i
did
mind
so
much
about
their
agreeing
to
keep
evelyn
lee
for
she
a
mighty
nice
sort
of
a
girl
and
will
make
a
still
nicer
one
when
she
gets
strong
but
these
peyton
youngsters
i
certainly
do
think
taking
care
of
them
ought
to
have
been
on
the
bill
that
idiot
lucy
his
expressive
face
finished
the
sentence
for
him
celia
smiled
i
know
i
feel
as
you
do
and
i
think
father
and
mother
are
a
little
anxious
lest
charlotte
has
taken
too
much
care
on
her
shoulders
but
charlotte
and
andy
have
set
out
to
make
everybody
happy
and
they
seizing
every
chance
that
offers
they
so
enthusiastic
about
it
one
ca
bear
to
dampen
their
ardour
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
help
them
whenever
we
can
jeff
made
a
wry
face
i
do
mind
assisting
in
the
boy
education
but
i
draw
the
line
at
the
girl
she
a
silly
why
she
his
face
coloured
with
resentment
it
sounds
crazy
to
say
but
she
does
for
a
fact
make
eyes
at
every
man
or
boy
she
sees
celia
laughed
i
had
noticed
but
she
ca
mean
to
jeff
only
fifteen
that
the
idiocy
of
it
she
only
fifteen
but
you
watch
her
the
next
time
any
of
us
fellows
come
into
the
room
just
can
tell
you
he
in
a
chronic
state
of
laugh
over
it
she
thinks
she
a
beauty
and
she
thinks
we
all
impressed
with
the
fact
she
is
pretty
i
do
think
so
i
do
call
any
girl
pretty
who
so
struck
with
herself
that
she
ca
get
by
a
mirror
without
a
glance
and
a
pat
of
that
big
fluff
of
front
hair
you
do
catch
eveyln
looking
into
a
glass
or
acting
as
if
she
thought
everybody
was
about
to
fall
in
love
with
her
i
going
to
take
her
skating
when
she
gets
strong
enough
that
wo
be
for
some
time
i
afraid
but
she
certainly
is
looking
better
already
so
she
was
charlotte
had
begun
very
gently
with
evelyn
reducing
the
temperature
of
the
daily
bath
only
by
a
degree
at
a
time
lessening
the
heat
in
the
sleeping
room
opening
the
windows
for
outside
air
an
inch
more
each
night
coaxing
her
out
for
a
short
walk
of
gradually
increasing
length
each
day
and
generally
luring
her
toward
more
healthful
ways
of
living
than
those
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
bedtime
found
evelyn
exceedingly
weary
but
it
was
healthful
weariness
and
she
was
beginning
to
be
able
to
sleep
a
tinge
of
colour
was
growing
in
the
pale
cheeks
a
brighter
expression
in
the
large
eyes
and
altogether
the
young
guest
was
showing
a
gratifying
response
to
the
new
methods
i
think
said
charlotte
to
evelyn
one
morning
when
three
weeks
had
gone
by
we
shall
have
to
celebrate
your
improvement
by
a
little
concert
this
evening
would
you
like
to
hear
the
orchestra
orchestra
how
lovely
indeed
i
should
cried
evelyn
with
a
display
of
enthusiasm
quite
unusual
what
do
you
play
strings
we
badly
out
of
practice
but
there
are
always
a
few
old
things
we
can
get
up
fairly
well
at
a
minute
notice
the
truth
is
we
have
played
together
since
long
before
my
and
i
resolved
the
minute
we
were
married
we
begin
again
we
will
begin
this
very
night
i
know
they
all
be
glad
the
performers
did
indeed
show
their
pleasure
by
arriving
early
instruments
under
their
arms
doctor
churchill
came
in
just
as
they
were
tuning
since
lanse
had
been
away
andy
who
was
something
of
a
violinist
had
taken
up
lanse
viola
and
was
now
able
to
occupy
his
place
celia
however
had
been
chosen
to
fill
the
vacant
rÃ´le
of
leadership
the
rest
of
us
are
only
imitators
jeff
declared
to
evelyn
as
he
stood
near
her
softly
trying
his
strings
charlotte
the
best
and
andy
very
good
indeed
but
it
only
celia
who
goes
to
hear
big
music
and
sits
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
while
the
rest
of
us
are
wondering
what
on
earth
it
all
means
evelyn
leaning
back
among
the
pillows
of
the
wide
couch
called
lucy
softly
motioning
her
to
a
seat
by
her
side
lucy
came
quickly
pleased
by
evelyn
notice
she
in
her
turn
had
been
regarding
evelyn
as
a
monopolist
of
everybody
attention
and
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
like
her
but
now
she
sank
into
the
place
by
side
and
accepted
the
delicate
touch
of
evelyn
hand
on
hers
as
recognition
at
last
that
here
was
another
girl
fit
to
make
friends
with
do
they
play
well
whispered
evelyn
as
the
music
came
to
a
sudden
stop
that
celia
might
criticise
the
playing
of
a
difficult
passage
she
does
think
so
called
just
softly
having
caught
the
whisper
he
indicated
his
elder
sister
she
wo
let
me
boom
things
with
my
viol
the
way
i
like
to
what
the
use
of
playing
the
biggest
instrument
if
you
ca
make
the
biggest
noise
solo
by
the
cried
andy
and
the
whole
orchestra
except
the
first
violin
of
the
leader
burst
into
a
boisterous
rendering
of
a
popular
street
song
in
which
just
sawed
forth
the
leading
part
while
the
others
kept
up
a
rattling
staccato
accompaniment
evelyn
and
lucy
became
breathless
with
laughter
and
and
birch
who
had
just
slipped
into
the
room
joined
in
the
merriment
there
you
are
chuckled
jeff
that
what
you
get
when
you
give
the
donkey
the
solo
part
among
the
farmyard
performers
he
can
sing
as
well
as
the
peacock
retorted
just
with
spirit
we
were
right
in
the
middle
of
the
intermezzo
explained
celia
to
the
newcomers
i
stopped
them
to
tell
them
why
they
needed
to
look
more
carefully
to
their
phrasing
and
the
children
burst
into
this
sort
of
thing
what
shall
i
do
with
them
it
a
great
relief
to
feel
that
they
not
altogether
grown
up
after
all
said
birch
helping
himself
to
his
favourite
easy
chair
near
the
fireplace
there
are
times
when
we
feel
a
strong
suspicion
that
we
have
any
children
any
more
moments
like
these
assure
us
that
we
are
mistaken
go
on
with
your
but
give
us
another
nursery
song
before
you
are
through
nursery
song
that
pretty
good
said
jeff
in
just
ear
and
that
mumbled
in
reply
i
can
throw
you
over
my
shoulder
just
the
same
boys
come
we
ready
called
celia
and
the
music
began
again
are
you
getting
tired
dear
asked
birch
of
evelyn
when
the
was
finished
noting
the
flush
on
the
delicate
cheek
evelyn
looked
up
brightly
not
enough
to
hurt
me
i
enjoying
it
so
are
large
families
lovely
i
was
so
much
younger
than
my
brothers
and
sisters
that
by
the
time
i
was
old
enough
to
care
about
having
good
times
like
this
on
winter
evenings
they
were
all
away
at
school
or
married
we
never
had
anything
so
nice
as
a
family
orchestra
either
i
wish
i
could
play
something
how
about
the
piano
asked
charlotte
who
sat
near
evelyn
flush
grew
pinker
i
can
play
a
little
she
said
but
you
do
need
the
piano
yes
we
do
a
piano
would
add
ever
so
much
next
time
we
have
our
practice
at
home
and
give
you
a
part
then
she
glanced
at
lucy
and
saw
what
might
have
been
expected
a
look
of
envy
and
discontent
is
there
anything
you
can
play
lucy
she
asked
it
would
be
very
nice
to
have
everybody
in
perhaps
ran
could
have
a
triangle
i
play
the
piano
said
lucy
oh
give
lucy
the
piano
evelyn
said
quickly
also
as
might
have
been
expected
we
try
you
both
put
in
doctor
churchill
as
they
always
do
aspirants
for
such
positions
i
had
lessons
from
the
best
master
in
our
state
said
lucy
to
just
that
so
then
you
may
win
out
was
his
opinion
but
you
ca
be
sure
evelyn
not
much
of
a
bragger
but
she
seems
to
be
a
pretty
girl
just
be
careful
warned
charlotte
in
his
ear
as
she
drew
him
gently
to
one
side
i
know
you
do
like
her
but
you
must
be
considerate
of
her
i
do
feel
much
like
it
you
know
i
want
your
help
about
lucy
charlotte
had
drawn
him
still
farther
away
so
that
she
could
speak
with
safety
but
you
know
too
that
snubbing
is
a
way
to
get
hold
of
anybody
it
the
only
way
with
conceited
softies
began
just
but
charlotte
caught
his
hand
and
squeezed
it
no
it
is
i
sure
she
worth
being
friends
with
and
if
she
can
learn
certain
things
you
can
teach
her
in
the
way
of
athletics
and
reading
and
all
that
you
can
do
her
lots
of
good
do
feel
a
bit
like
being
a
missionary
growled
just
suppose
got
to
try
it
to
please
you
evelyn
all
right
is
she
yes
she
a
dear
i
so
glad
we
kept
her
that
makes
me
realise
had
quite
enough
excitement
for
i
must
carry
her
off
to
bed
perhaps
you
all
better
no
you
do
said
just
with
a
rebellious
laugh
just
because
you
set
up
a
sanatorium
and
a
kindergarten
you
ca
send
your
brothers
off
to
bed
at
nine
i
want
a
good
visit
with
you
after
the
infants
and
invalids
are
in
bed
all
right
big
boy
promised
charlotte
rejoicing
in
the
affectionate
look
he
gave
her
she
had
been
anxious
that
her
marriage
should
in
no
way
interfere
with
the
old
brotherly
and
sisterly
relations
and
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
had
a
confidential
talk
with
her
youngest
brother
jeff
was
always
coming
to
her
precisely
as
in
the
old
days
with
demands
for
interest
and
advice
but
just
had
seemed
a
little
farther
away
so
when
she
had
seen
the
infants
and
invalids
happily
gone
to
rest
and
after
a
quiet
hour
of
family
talk
about
the
fireside
had
said
to
all
the
others
charlotte
turned
to
just
with
a
look
of
welcome
as
fresh
and
inviting
as
if
the
evening
had
but
now
begun
doctor
churchill
had
gone
to
make
a
bedtime
call
upon
a
patient
critically
ill
and
the
two
were
quite
alone
this
is
jolly
said
just
settling
himself
on
a
couch
pillow
at
her
feet
his
long
legs
stretched
out
to
the
fire
his
head
resting
against
his
sister
knee
now
i
going
to
tell
you
everything
that
happened
to
me
since
you
were
married
not
that
there
anything
wonderful
to
tell
or
that
i
in
any
scrape
you
know
but
i
like
to
feel
i
got
my
sister
and
that
she
cares
just
as
much
as
ever
he
twisted
his
head
about
till
he
could
look
up
into
the
warm
sweet
face
above
him
she
care
as
much
as
ever
it
was
an
unusual
demonstration
from
the
big
boy
now
at
the
age
when
sisterly
companionship
is
often
despised
and
charlotte
appreciated
it
more
than
justin
birch
could
understand
was
in
her
voice
as
her
fingers
rested
upon
his
hair
but
what
she
said
gave
him
great
satisfaction
although
it
was
only
a
blithe
just
as
much
and
a
little
more
dear
tell
me
the
whole
story
nothing
i
like
so
much
to
hear
chapter
v
evelyn
miss
evelyn
lee
where
are
you
jeff
shout
rang
up
the
stairs
and
in
obedience
to
its
imperative
summons
evelyn
immediately
appeared
at
the
head
yes
jefferson
birch
she
responded
is
the
house
on
fire
not
a
bit
but
i
anxious
for
your
hearing
i
been
roaring
gently
all
over
the
house
without
a
result
except
to
scare
three
patients
in
andy
office
wo
you
come
down
she
descended
slowly
but
she
neither
clung
to
the
rail
nor
sat
down
to
rest
as
she
had
done
when
she
first
came
under
the
churchill
roof
her
face
was
acquiring
the
soft
bloom
of
a
flower
her
eyes
were
full
of
light
and
interest
she
still
looked
slim
and
frail
but
she
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
waxing
health
very
pleasant
to
see
for
those
who
had
grown
as
interested
in
her
as
if
she
were
a
young
sister
of
their
own
i
an
invitation
for
you
from
carolyn
houghton
for
an
impromptu
do
you
suppose
you
can
go
i
take
all
sorts
of
care
of
you
and
see
that
you
do
get
too
tired
you
met
carolyn
she
a
jolly
girl
to
know
and
she
told
me
to
bring
you
if
possible
evelyn
dropped
into
a
chair
oh
how
i
should
love
to
go
she
said
i
never
went
on
a
like
that
in
my
life
do
you
go
all
together
in
a
big
load
yes
a
regular
of
a
sleigh
holds
a
dozen
of
us
packed
like
sardines
so
nobody
can
get
cold
we
take
hot
soapstones
and
rugs
and
robes
and
we
go
only
twelve
miles
to
a
farmhouse
where
we
get
a
hot
supper
oysters
and
hot
biscuit
and
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
you
must
go
if
i
only
could
sighed
evelyn
i
so
afraid
they
wo
think
i
can
they
will
if
think
you
can
asserted
jeff
you
up
to
it
are
you
you
need
do
a
thing
six
of
the
crowd
are
going
to
give
a
little
play
i
get
the
load
started
home
early
and
we
come
back
flying
be
here
by
midnight
at
the
latest
it
do
you
good
i
know
it
will
o
mrs
churchill
breathed
evelyn
as
charlotte
appeared
from
the
hall
o
evelyn
lee
answered
charlotte
smiling
back
at
the
eager
face
yes
i
heard
most
of
it
jeff
for
i
was
coming
and
you
were
exactly
whispering
it
an
enticing
plan
is
it
of
course
it
is
and
it
magnificent
weather
for
the
affair
not
cold
a
bit
and
no
wind
moonlight
due
if
no
clouds
come
up
evelyn
ca
get
cold
i
keep
her
done
up
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
be
so
devoted
nobody
else
will
have
a
chance
to
worry
her
say
she
may
go
do
you
see
the
disappointment
would
be
worse
for
her
than
the
trip
you
artful
pleader
i
not
sure
but
it
would
if
doctor
churchill
agrees
evelyn
i
let
you
try
it
on
one
condition
jeff
that
you
really
do
get
back
by
midnight
for
a
girl
who
has
been
put
to
bed
for
weeks
at
nine
that
late
enough
evelyn
went
about
all
day
with
a
lighter
step
than
her
friends
had
yet
seen
her
assume
now
remember
i
trust
her
absolutely
to
your
care
charlotte
said
to
jeff
that
evening
as
he
appeared
his
arms
full
of
accessories
for
making
his
charge
comfortable
evelyn
in
furs
and
heavy
coat
smiled
at
her
escort
i
not
a
bit
afraid
she
said
oh
what
a
beautiful
night
the
moon
is
out
is
that
the
sleigh
coming
up
the
street
now
with
all
those
horns
what
fun
i
want
to
put
miss
lee
right
in
the
middle
of
everything
jeff
called
out
as
the
sleighload
stopped
i
particularly
requested
not
to
let
a
breath
of
frost
strike
her
come
on
here
just
the
spot
answered
carolyn
houghton
holding
out
a
welcoming
hand
and
then
the
girl
from
the
south
who
had
never
known
the
of
the
north
found
herself
being
whirled
away
over
the
road
to
an
accompaniment
of
youthful
merriment
bursts
of
songs
and
tooting
of
horns
before
it
seemed
possible
the
twelve
miles
of
fine
sleighing
had
been
covered
and
the
old
farmhouse
its
door
flung
hospitably
open
at
the
sound
of
the
horns
was
invaded
by
the
gay
band
evelyn
in
a
quaint
bedroom
lighted
by
kerosene
lamps
and
warmed
by
a
roaring
wood
fire
in
an
box
stove
was
attended
by
carolyn
houghton
who
was
as
jeff
had
said
a
jolly
girl
to
know
herself
a
blooming
maid
with
black
locks
and
carnation
cheeks
carolyn
admired
intensely
evelyn
auburn
hair
and
fair
complexion
do
you
think
she
the
dearest
thing
she
whispered
to
a
friend
as
they
descended
the
stairs
there
something
so
soft
and
sweet
and
ladylike
about
her
as
if
nobody
could
be
slangy
or
loud
before
her
you
know
yet
she
is
a
bit
dull
she
just
when
you
get
her
interested
and
happy
i
do
want
her
to
have
a
good
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
evelyn
was
having
a
good
time
everything
pleased
her
everybody
interested
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
seen
such
charming
young
people
before
the
little
play
made
her
laugh
till
she
was
as
flushed
and
gay
as
a
child
those
with
whom
evelyn
showed
herself
so
delighted
became
equally
delighted
with
her
and
before
the
evening
was
over
she
was
feeling
that
she
had
always
known
these
young
friends
had
forgotten
that
she
had
ever
been
an
invalid
and
was
indeed
sparkling
as
carolyn
houghton
had
said
in
a
way
that
drew
all
eyes
toward
her
in
admiration
jeff
indeed
stared
at
her
as
if
he
had
never
seen
her
before
i
sure
this
is
hurting
you
a
bit
he
said
in
her
ear
as
the
evening
slipped
on
you
must
be
feeling
pretty
well
for
i
never
seen
you
so
jolly
i
going
to
do
the
prescribing
after
this
i
know
what
good
for
little
girls
i
believe
you
do
evelyn
answered
no
i
not
a
bit
tired
why
is
it
almost
eleven
yes
and
time
to
go
if
we
live
up
to
our
promises
seems
a
pity
does
it
but
it
does
pay
to
break
your
word
so
as
soon
as
you
girls
can
get
into
your
toggery
we
be
off
of
course
we
must
keep
our
promise
agreed
evelyn
with
decision
and
straightway
she
went
for
her
wraps
the
other
girls
followed
more
reluctantly
girls
look
out
cried
somebody
from
the
window
did
you
ever
see
it
so
thick
the
barns
are
just
down
there
where
that
glimmer
is
but
you
ca
see
them
at
all
all
the
more
fun
said
another
girl
we
pretty
far
out
in
the
country
and
the
road
awfully
winding
i
hope
we
get
home
all
right
oh
nonsense
said
some
one
else
with
great
positiveness
i
should
know
the
way
with
my
eyes
shut
besides
it
was
as
clear
as
a
bell
when
we
came
it
ca
have
been
snowing
long
enough
to
block
things
in
the
least
they
found
it
had
done
so
however
when
they
descended
to
the
sleigh
that
vehicle
had
been
brought
close
to
the
porch
that
the
girls
might
not
have
to
walk
through
the
deep
snow
the
air
was
so
full
of
the
whirling
white
particles
that
from
the
farther
end
of
the
sleigh
one
could
barely
see
the
horses
i
declare
i
do
feel
just
easy
about
you
folks
starting
out
said
the
farmer
whose
guests
they
had
been
better
watch
the
road
some
careful
you
driver
i
suppose
you
know
it
pretty
well
he
does
but
i
do
called
a
tall
youth
from
the
driver
seat
i
keep
him
straight
we
be
all
right
we
due
home
at
midnight
and
we
be
there
unless
the
roads
are
too
heavy
to
keep
the
pace
we
came
in
no
sir
we
ca
ever
keep
the
pace
we
come
in
presently
averred
the
man
from
the
who
was
driving
the
road
pretty
heavy
i
declare
i
do
know
as
i
ever
see
snow
so
thick
do
i
turn
a
little
to
the
right
here
or
do
i
keep
straight
ahead
straight
ahead
answered
the
boy
beside
him
confidently
i
been
over
this
road
a
thousand
times
and
it
does
bend
to
the
right
for
half
a
mile
yet
it
lucky
you
know
said
the
driver
i
all
at
sea
already
see
the
fences
only
now
and
then
i
ha
swung
off
there
sure
if
you
had
said
not
as
the
rising
wind
began
to
whirl
snowily
about
their
ears
and
necks
the
party
turned
up
their
and
tucked
in
their
fur
robes
the
horses
were
plowing
with
increasing
difficulty
through
the
heavily
drifted
roads
and
more
than
once
their
driver
found
himself
obliged
to
make
a
long
detour
around
a
drift
which
had
not
been
in
the
road
when
they
first
came
over
it
moreover
in
spite
of
the
snow
the
air
seemed
to
have
grown
colder
and
to
be
acquiring
a
penetrating
icy
quality
which
at
last
made
jeff
declare
to
evelyn
you
may
say
you
not
cold
but
i
going
to
insist
on
your
letting
me
wrap
this
steamer
rug
found
your
shoulders
with
the
corner
over
your
head
so
now
does
that
keep
off
a
lot
of
wind
indeed
it
does
thank
you
admitted
evelyn
with
a
little
shiver
she
could
not
quite
conceal
you
cold
jeff
said
anxiously
no
colder
than
anybody
else
please
do
worry
about
me
but
he
did
worry
and
with
reason
indeed
although
nobody
was
willing
yet
to
admit
it
the
situation
was
becoming
a
little
unpleasant
in
spite
of
the
stout
confidence
of
the
boy
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
others
who
were
somewhat
familiar
with
the
road
were
beginning
to
question
his
leading
that
clump
of
trees
does
look
natural
just
there
said
one
standing
up
in
the
sleigh
and
trying
to
peer
through
the
wall
of
snowflakes
it
too
near
it
ought
to
be
a
hundred
feet
away
no
you
thinking
we
farther
back
than
we
are
declared
neil
ward
from
the
front
seat
we
almost
at
the
turn
by
the
railroad
why
we
ca
be
we
have
passed
the
winters
farm
i
tell
you
you
off
the
road
i
think
we
are
agreed
the
driver
uneasily
pulling
his
cap
farther
over
his
eyebrows
i
been
thinking
so
for
quite
a
spell
we
all
right
you
people
just
keep
cool
cried
neil
no
trouble
about
keeping
cool
in
this
blizzard
growled
somebody
and
there
was
a
general
laugh
one
of
the
girls
started
a
song
and
they
all
joined
cheerily
in
a
proposition
to
toot
the
horns
forgotten
in
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
with
a
hope
of
attracting
attention
from
some
one
was
adopted
and
a
hideous
din
followed
and
was
kept
up
till
every
one
was
weary
with
no
result
all
at
once
without
warning
the
horses
plunged
heavily
and
solidly
to
their
steaming
shoulders
into
an
ditch
and
the
sleigh
stopped
well
into
the
same
hole
will
you
admit
now
that
we
off
the
road
neil
ward
cried
some
one
fiercely
and
neil
without
contention
but
with
evident
chagrin
admitted
it
there
was
no
ditch
that
he
was
aware
of
within
a
mile
of
the
highway
jeff
drew
the
rugs
tighter
about
evelyn
then
lifted
a
corner
to
peer
in
do
be
frightened
little
girl
we
get
out
of
this
all
right
he
said
as
cheerfully
as
he
could
although
he
was
alarmed
for
her
safety
more
than
he
would
have
dared
to
admit
even
to
himself
the
other
girls
were
all
strong
healthy
specimens
of
young
womanhood
presumably
able
to
endure
a
good
deal
of
cold
and
exposure
without
danger
of
serious
harm
but
this
little
sensitive
plant
jeff
waited
in
suspense
for
her
answer
it
came
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
without
a
particle
of
fright
in
it
of
course
we
shall
and
wo
it
be
fun
to
tell
about
it
afterward
you
right
it
will
he
responded
with
enthusiasm
inwardly
he
said
you
a
plucky
one
all
right
then
with
the
other
fellows
he
leaped
out
of
the
sleigh
and
went
to
trampling
down
the
snow
around
the
imprisoned
horses
alone
together
after
randolph
and
lucy
had
gone
to
bed
andrew
and
charlotte
passed
the
long
evening
charlotte
was
not
willing
to
let
evelyn
come
home
to
a
closed
and
silent
house
so
the
two
awaited
her
arrival
why
andy
it
snowing
furiously
said
charlotte
from
the
window
whither
she
had
gone
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
doctor
churchill
put
down
the
book
from
which
he
had
been
reading
aloud
and
came
to
her
side
so
it
is
blowing
too
but
it
ca
have
been
at
it
long
or
we
should
have
noticed
i
been
noticing
the
wind
now
and
then
for
the
last
hour
i
hope
not
grown
cold
i
would
have
anything
happen
to
upset
improvement
for
the
world
nothing
will
they
be
home
before
the
come
back
and
listen
to
the
rest
of
this
chapter
charlotte
came
back
but
as
the
went
slowly
by
she
became
restless
and
vibrated
so
continually
between
fireplace
and
window
that
andy
finally
put
away
the
book
and
kept
her
company
it
growing
worse
every
minute
charlotte
face
was
pressed
close
against
the
frosty
pane
if
they
do
come
by
one
it
will
look
as
if
something
had
happened
oh
they
at
the
irresponsible
age
when
they
come
they
say
we
did
dream
it
was
so
late
jeff
not
irresponsible
when
he
gives
a
promise
he
never
breaks
one
charlotte
answered
confidently
this
storm
would
make
the
roads
heavy
even
if
they
started
on
time
they
would
have
to
travel
twice
as
slowly
as
when
they
went
stop
worrying
dear
it
not
in
character
for
you
charlotte
closed
her
lips
but
when
the
clock
struck
one
her
eyes
spoke
for
her
evelyn
is
so
delicate
they
said
mutely
and
andy
answered
as
if
she
had
spoken
evelyn
is
wrapped
too
heavily
to
be
cold
besides
they
all
take
care
of
her
she
wo
come
to
any
harm
i
sure
of
it
they
be
here
before
i
confident
and
then
we
can
antidote
any
chill
she
may
have
got
but
at
there
was
still
no
sign
of
the
sleighing
party
moreover
the
storm
was
steadily
increasing
it
had
become
what
is
known
as
a
blizzard
even
in
the
protected
suburban
street
the
drifts
were
beginning
to
show
size
and
the
at
the
corner
was
almost
lost
to
view
through
the
downfall
charlotte
turned
to
her
husband
with
something
like
imperiousness
in
her
manner
and
met
the
same
decision
in
his
look
before
she
could
speak
he
said
yes
i
go
to
meet
them
it
does
look
as
if
they
might
be
stalled
somewhere
it
rather
a
lonely
road
till
they
reach
the
railroad
and
it
possible
they
missed
the
way
he
went
to
the
telephone
andy
cried
charlotte
following
him
order
a
double
sleigh
please
i
must
go
with
you
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
hesitating
it
is
necessary
dear
go
over
and
wake
up
just
i
think
we
two
will
be
i
must
go
she
interrupted
i
could
endure
to
wait
here
any
longer
and
if
evelyn
should
be
very
much
chilled
she
need
me
to
look
after
her
besides
he
smiled
at
her
you
wo
let
me
get
lost
in
a
myself
without
you
she
nodded
and
ran
away
to
make
ready
by
the
time
the
had
been
awakened
from
its
early
morning
apathy
and
had
sent
round
the
double
sleigh
with
the
best
pair
of
horses
in
its
stalls
the
party
was
ready
just
awakened
by
snowballs
thrown
in
at
his
open
window
had
joyfully
dressed
himself
at
the
last
moment
charlotte
had
thought
of
the
automobile
headlight
and
this
hurriedly
filled
and
lighted
streamed
out
over
the
snow
as
the
three
jumped
into
the
sleigh
all
were
warmly
dressed
and
charlotte
had
brought
many
extra
wraps
as
well
as
a
supply
of
medicines
for
a
possible
emergency
of
which
she
did
not
like
to
think
julius
caesar
but
this
is
a
night
came
from
between
just
teeth
as
the
sleigh
reached
the
end
of
the
suburban
streets
and
made
the
turn
upon
the
open
country
road
he
clutched
at
his
cap
pulling
it
still
farther
down
over
his
ears
what
a
change
in
six
hours
this
is
a
straight
answered
doctor
churchill
slapping
hands
already
chilled
in
spite
of
his
heavy
driving
gloves
then
he
turned
his
head
ca
you
keep
well
down
behind
us
charlotte
he
called
over
his
shoulder
i
all
right
she
called
back
one
had
to
shout
to
be
heard
in
the
roar
of
the
wind
after
that
nobody
talked
except
as
just
from
time
to
time
offered
to
drive
to
give
andrew
hands
a
chance
to
warm
that
young
man
however
would
not
give
over
the
reins
to
anybody
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
had
been
driving
over
this
country
under
all
possible
conditions
of
weather
for
nearly
five
years
when
they
had
crossed
the
railroad
which
marked
the
end
of
the
main
highway
between
two
towns
and
the
beginning
of
the
narrow
side
road
which
led
off
across
country
to
the
farmhouse
of
the
sleighing
party
conviction
that
the
young
people
had
been
stalled
somewhere
on
the
great
plain
they
were
crossing
became
settled
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
doctor
churchill
kept
the
road
only
the
fact
that
the
storm
was
showing
signs
of
decreasing
and
that
now
and
then
came
moments
when
he
could
see
more
clearly
the
outlying
indications
of
fence
and
tree
and
infrequent
habitation
assured
him
that
he
had
not
lost
the
way
hark
cried
charlotte
suddenly
as
they
plowed
along
for
the
instant
the
wind
had
lulled
doctor
churchill
stopped
his
horses
and
the
three
held
their
breath
to
listen
after
a
brief
interval
came
the
faint
far
toot
of
a
horn
then
away
to
the
left
a
light
suddenly
flashed
vanished
and
flashed
again
there
they
are
cried
three
exultant
voices
but
how
shall
we
get
to
them
shouted
just
instantly
alive
with
excitement
why
they
a
mile
away
there
no
road
over
there
nor
any
houses
they
right
out
in
the
fields
then
the
sifting
snow
shut
down
again
the
three
looked
at
one
another
in
the
yellow
glare
from
the
automobile
headlight
chapter
vi
do
they
see
our
light
charlotte
asked
eagerly
i
think
perhaps
they
have
seen
it
doctor
churchill
answered
and
that
why
they
were
blowing
their
horns
probably
some
of
them
will
start
toward
us
if
they
not
stuck
they
begin
to
drive
this
way
i
believe
the
thing
to
do
will
be
for
charlotte
to
stay
here
in
the
sleigh
keeping
the
headlight
pointed
just
to
the
left
of
that
big
tree
i
noticed
that
was
where
the
flash
of
their
fire
came
and
for
just
and
me
to
start
across
the
fields
i
turn
the
horses
with
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
blanket
them
then
hold
on
i
a
better
plan
let
make
a
fire
of
our
own
that
will
insure
charlotte
keeping
warm
everything
too
wet
objected
just
that
crowd
must
have
had
a
time
getting
green
wood
to
burn
we
can
do
it
doctor
churchill
was
feeling
among
the
robes
at
his
feet
i
thought
of
it
before
we
started
and
put
in
a
and
some
newspapers
hatchet
too
just
got
out
of
the
sleigh
and
waded
away
toward
a
thick
growth
of
underbrush
along
the
side
of
the
road
in
ten
minutes
a
roaring
fire
was
leaping
into
the
descending
snowfall
a
pile
of
brush
and
some
broken
were
left
with
charlotte
the
horses
made
as
snug
as
possible
and
then
the
two
others
jumped
the
fence
and
plunged
off
into
the
snow
guided
by
glimpses
of
the
apparently
fitful
fire
of
the
sleighing
party
doctor
churchill
and
just
made
their
way
sometimes
the
course
was
comparatively
free
from
drifts
again
they
had
to
wallow
nearly
to
their
waists
confounded
long
way
grunted
just
good
thing
we
both
tough
and
strong
except
for
jeff
there
are
any
athletes
in
the
houghton
party
do
i
see
somebody
coming
toward
us
doctor
churchill
asked
presently
the
snowfall
was
lightening
again
and
the
small
flame
in
the
distance
looked
nearer
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
gave
a
long
clear
hail
he
was
answered
by
a
similar
one
then
followed
a
peculiar
musical
call
which
just
recognising
answered
ecstatically
it
jeff
he
shouted
i
bet
he
glad
to
hear
us
he
was
he
came
plunging
through
the
last
big
drift
toward
them
a
figure
well
well
he
cried
in
tones
of
pleasure
and
relief
i
knew
you
come
where
are
we
anyhow
a
mile
off
the
road
are
you
all
right
i
see
you
got
a
fire
how
evelyn
all
right
i
think
since
we
managed
the
fire
she
fairly
warm
again
plucky
as
any
girl
in
the
crowd
and
they
all
plucky
how
are
we
to
get
our
load
down
to
the
road
i
brought
ropes
and
we
a
strong
pair
back
there
we
go
and
get
them
now
that
we
know
where
you
are
you
go
back
to
your
party
and
prepare
them
to
be
rescued
no
just
can
go
to
the
camp
and
i
keep
on
with
you
just
being
entirely
willing
to
accept
the
part
of
rescuer
plowed
on
through
the
big
holes
jeff
had
left
in
his
track
doctor
churchill
and
jeff
made
their
way
back
to
charlotte
yes
we
had
rather
a
bad
time
for
a
while
admitted
jeff
as
he
helped
andy
make
the
horses
ready
to
start
we
got
pretty
cold
and
i
thought
we
never
make
the
fire
go
found
the
inside
of
an
old
stump
at
last
and
got
her
started
yes
all
the
girls
looked
after
evelyn
came
pretty
near
smothering
her
i
do
believe
she
taken
cold
the
letting
up
i
can
see
our
fire
back
there
no
we
did
see
yours
we
were
just
tooting
on
general
principles
evelyn
insisted
she
caught
a
glimmer
and
i
started
out
to
climb
a
tree
to
find
out
i
saw
it
then
for
a
minute
and
was
sure
it
was
you
keep
this
fire
going
charlotte
the
storm
may
close
down
again
and
we
want
to
make
straight
tracks
across
the
fields
by
the
time
they
reached
the
camp
in
the
fields
both
jeff
and
doctor
churchill
were
pretty
well
wearied
but
they
greeted
the
party
there
with
an
enthusiasm
which
matched
the
welcome
they
received
the
spirits
of
the
whole
company
had
risen
with
a
jump
the
instant
they
had
caught
sight
of
just
and
now
with
four
horses
to
pull
the
ponderous
sleigh
through
the
drifts
the
boys
walking
by
its
side
and
the
girls
tucked
snugly
in
among
the
robes
the
whole
aspect
of
things
was
changed
the
situation
lost
seriousness
and
although
each
was
prepared
to
make
a
thrilling
tale
of
it
for
the
various
family
circles
when
daylight
came
nobody
except
jeff
really
regretted
the
experience
of
the
night
when
they
reached
charlotte
and
the
smaller
sleigh
there
was
a
great
chorus
of
explanations
she
swiftly
extracted
evelyn
and
took
her
in
beside
herself
indeed
yes
i
warm
churchill
protested
the
girl
her
voice
showed
that
she
was
very
tired
but
her
inflection
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
with
a
hot
soapstone
at
her
feet
a
bag
in
her
lap
and
charlotte
arm
about
her
she
leaned
back
on
the
shoulder
beside
her
and
rejoiced
one
thing
was
certain
she
had
had
a
real
northern
good
time
with
an
exciting
ending
and
she
was
quite
willing
to
be
tired
with
the
wind
at
their
backs
and
the
fall
of
snow
nearly
ceased
the
party
was
not
a
great
while
in
getting
back
to
town
the
clocks
were
striking
five
when
charlotte
having
put
her
charge
to
bed
and
fed
her
with
hot
food
and
spicy
steaming
drinks
administered
the
last
pat
and
tuck
now
you
not
to
open
your
eyes
and
stir
until
four
this
afternoon
she
admonished
her
with
decisive
tenderness
then
if
you
very
good
you
may
get
up
and
dress
in
time
for
dinner
i
be
good
churchill
promised
evelyn
smiling
rather
faintly
she
fell
asleep
almost
before
the
door
closed
you
must
feel
a
load
off
your
shoulders
just
observed
to
jeff
as
the
two
made
ready
for
slumber
for
the
brief
time
remaining
before
breakfast
and
the
school
and
college
work
which
would
then
claim
them
both
i
do
but
if
evelyn
comes
out
all
right
i
shall
be
glad
i
took
her
i
tell
you
that
girl
a
mighty
good
sort
i
wish
lucy
was
like
her
what
do
you
think
i
in
for
our
class
reception
is
for
friday
night
at
the
house
doctor
agnew
daughters
have
met
lucy
and
i
sure
she
gave
a
hint
to
invite
her
to
come
with
me
anyhow
they
done
it
and
of
course
got
to
take
her
oh
well
a
fellow
has
to
be
civil
to
a
lot
of
girls
he
particularly
admire
lucy
not
so
bad
she
rather
pretty
when
feeling
amiable
and
she
certainly
dresses
well
jeff
assertion
in
the
matter
of
lucy
appearance
was
proved
true
when
just
on
friday
evening
marched
across
to
the
other
house
inwardly
raging
at
his
fate
he
had
an
agreeable
surprise
as
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
with
charlotte
lucy
came
and
floated
in
at
the
door
just
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
stared
being
really
a
very
pretty
girl
and
feeling
at
the
present
moment
the
height
of
fluttering
expectation
her
face
was
illumined
into
an
attractiveness
that
was
quite
a
revelation
to
her
friends
for
the
first
time
lucy
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
centre
of
things
and
it
made
another
girl
of
her
in
addition
the
evening
frock
she
wore
was
so
charming
in
style
and
colouring
that
it
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
general
effect
altogether
just
experienced
quite
a
revulsion
of
feeling
in
regard
to
the
painful
duty
before
him
and
came
forward
to
assist
lucy
into
her
long
coat
with
considerable
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
oh
i
do
love
parties
so
she
declared
as
they
hurried
along
the
streets
i
not
used
to
being
so
dull
as
i
been
here
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
mighty
few
doings
for
young
people
i
do
call
and
fudge
parties
real
probably
you
wo
call
this
a
real
party
then
there
never
much
that
exciting
at
doctor
agnew
he
always
has
an
orchestra
playing
and
we
walk
round
and
talk
and
usually
somebody
does
something
to
entertain
us
a
reading
or
songs
maybe
you
wo
think
it
as
festive
as
you
expect
oh
well
i
reckon
it
will
be
a
nice
change
said
she
with
quite
unexpected
good
humour
in
the
chester
agnew
the
son
of
the
came
up
to
just
with
an
expression
of
mingled
pleasure
and
chagrin
awfully
glad
to
see
you
birch
he
said
i
suppose
you
noticed
that
we
have
no
music
going
it
a
shame
is
it
lindmann
men
have
been
delayed
by
a
freight
wreck
on
the
q
they
were
coming
home
from
a
wedding
down
the
line
somewhere
and
telephoned
us
they
could
get
out
here
before
midnight
we
tried
to
get
some
other
music
but
everything
engaged
somewhere
too
bad
but
it
no
great
matter
just
replied
comfortably
we
can
worry
along
without
the
orchestra
no
you
ca
mother
plans
for
were
for
a
series
of
national
dances
in
costume
by
sixteen
of
the
juniors
and
that
all
up
without
the
music
why
wo
the
piano
do
we
have
a
piano
in
the
house
yes
i
know
but
it
was
helena
and
when
she
was
married
in
november
she
took
it
with
her
father
bought
a
new
one
yet
because
the
other
girls
do
play
now
do
you
see
you
in
for
the
stupidest
evening
you
had
this
winter
for
it
too
late
to
get
anybody
here
to
do
any
sort
of
entertaining
that
is
too
bad
admitted
just
thinking
of
lucy
and
finding
himself
caring
a
good
deal
that
she
should
not
think
the
affair
dull
he
walked
along
the
hall
with
chester
to
the
point
where
he
should
meet
lucy
thinking
about
the
situation
then
an
idea
popped
into
his
head
is
your
telephone
in
that
little
closet
off
the
he
asked
yes
want
to
use
it
yes
take
lucy
down
will
you
you
know
her
i
just
thought
of
something
just
slipped
down
to
the
he
carefully
closed
the
door
of
the
closet
and
called
up
doctor
churchill
to
him
he
rapidly
explained
the
situation
and
the
remedy
which
had
occurred
to
him
doctor
churchill
voice
came
back
to
him
in
a
tone
of
amused
surprise
why
just
do
you
think
we
could
carry
it
through
decently
we
know
the
music
at
all
oh
play
our
own
and
make
it
fit
what
sort
will
do
ordinary
waltzes
and
i
should
mind
helping
them
out
of
course
if
i
thought
we
could
manage
it
better
than
nothing
well
possibly
better
consult
agnew
before
we
do
anything
rash
just
ran
up
the
rear
staircase
and
down
the
front
one
he
found
chester
and
whispered
his
plan
interrupting
chester
eager
gratitude
he
asked
for
somebody
who
could
tell
him
what
music
would
be
needed
mother
receiving
and
so
are
the
girls
carolyn
houghton
will
know
i
think
she
been
at
the
rehearsals
i
get
her
well
are
you
going
to
leave
me
to
myself
much
longer
lucy
inquired
reproachfully
as
just
waited
silently
beside
her
for
carolyn
why
i
awfully
sorry
he
said
remembering
his
duties
which
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
realised
he
was
forgetting
i
hope
excuse
me
but
i
got
to
help
the
agnews
out
if
i
can
and
he
hurriedly
told
her
his
plan
she
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
you
do
mean
you
would
come
and
take
the
place
of
a
hired
orchestra
for
a
reception
she
cried
under
her
breath
it
was
just
turn
to
stare
then
he
straightened
shoulders
which
were
already
pretty
square
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
not
that
is
provided
we
can
do
it
well
enough
i
think
it
a
mighty
queer
thing
to
do
insisted
lucy
with
disapproval
carolyn
houghton
appeared
and
beckoned
just
and
chester
out
into
the
hall
lucy
followed
not
liking
to
be
left
alone
everybody
seemed
to
be
forgetting
her
although
chester
had
turned
and
said
cordially
right
miss
lucy
come
and
help
us
plan
carolyn
lost
no
time
it
fine
of
you
she
said
eagerly
yes
sure
you
can
do
it
not
one
person
in
fifty
will
know
whether
the
tunes
you
play
are
national
or
not
something
quaint
and
queer
for
the
hungarian
and
jigsy
and
gay
for
the
irish
castanets
in
the
spanish
dance
have
you
them
young
randolph
peyton
can
work
those
began
just
looking
at
lucy
she
frowned
really
i
do
believe
you
better
have
him
in
it
she
said
with
such
an
air
that
carolyn
glanced
at
her
in
amazement
and
chester
coughed
and
turned
away
oh
very
well
just
answered
instantly
you
can
do
yourself
then
ches
all
right
said
chester
there
is
a
big
screen
of
palms
and
ferns
for
the
orchestra
he
explained
with
satisfaction
to
lucy
know
who
performing
anyhow
oh
said
lucy
carolyn
had
soon
convinced
just
that
the
little
home
orchestra
could
undertake
the
music
without
much
fear
of
failure
of
course
there
a
chance
that
the
change
may
put
the
dancers
out
yet
i
do
think
so
i
noticed
it
was
rather
simple
music
and
they
so
well
drilled
they
not
very
dependent
on
the
music
anyhow
people
will
be
too
interested
in
the
costumes
and
the
steps
to
notice
whether
the
music
is
strictly
appropriate
as
long
as
you
give
them
something
in
precisely
the
right
time
i
do
believe
the
change
will
bother
them
i
can
coach
you
on
that
all
right
and
just
hurried
back
to
the
telephone
within
of
an
hour
he
had
them
all
there
a
laughing
crew
ready
for
what
struck
them
as
a
frolic
for
themselves
chester
agnew
carried
the
instruments
behind
the
screen
and
managed
to
slip
the
members
of
the
new
orchestra
one
by
one
from
the
doorway
to
the
shelter
of
the
palms
without
anybody
being
the
wiser
in
ten
minutes
more
soft
music
began
to
steal
through
the
crowded
rooms
the
orchestra
has
come
after
all
said
agnew
to
her
husband
in
the
front
room
her
voice
breathed
relief
he
nodded
satisfaction
so
i
hear
i
do
know
how
they
managed
it
but
i
accept
the
fact
without
question
do
you
think
it
always
safe
to
do
that
queried
his
son
chester
coming
up
in
time
to
hear
accept
facts
without
question
what
else
can
you
do
with
facts
but
if
they
should
turn
out
not
to
be
facts
in
this
case
i
have
the
evidence
of
my
ears
returned
the
learned
man
comfortably
and
chester
walked
away
again
his
eyes
dancing
nobody
can
tell
you
from
lindmann
he
whispered
behind
the
screen
during
an
interval
that
good
hope
the
delusion
keeps
up
we
do
feel
much
like
lindmann
returned
churchill
hastily
turning
over
a
pile
of
music
get
your
crowd
to
talking
as
loud
as
it
can
then
we
comparatively
safe
where
the
second
violin
part
of
manfred
look
out
just
you
hit
my
elbow
twice
with
your
last
time
these
quarters
are
a
bit
there
you
are
charlotte
now
take
this
thing
slow
and
look
to
your
phrasing
all
ready
the
costume
dances
did
not
come
until
after
supper
by
that
time
the
churchills
and
birches
behind
the
screen
had
settled
down
to
steady
work
during
supper
a
violin
with
the
and
bass
carried
on
the
music
while
doctor
churchill
celia
and
carolyn
houghton
planned
a
substitute
programme
for
the
dances
in
two
cases
they
found
the
original
music
familiar
in
most
of
the
others
it
proved
not
very
difficult
to
adapt
other
music
the
leaders
of
the
dances
were
told
that
whatever
happened
they
were
to
carry
through
their
parts
without
showing
signs
of
distress
it
a
pretty
big
bluff
murmured
jeff
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
mopping
a
perspiring
brow
but
it
hot
in
here
i
expect
to
see
several
of
those
crazy
dances
go
all
to
pieces
on
our
account
that
highland
fling
mind
you
keep
up
a
ripping
time
on
that
it
ought
to
be
piped
not
stringed
nevertheless
in
spite
of
a
good
deal
of
perturbation
on
the
part
of
both
dancers
and
orchestra
the
entertainment
went
off
well
enough
to
be
applauded
heartily
certain
numbers
notably
the
south
carolina
breakdown
the
irish
jig
and
the
minuet
of
washington
time
brought
down
the
house
presumably
because
the
music
fitted
best
and
bothered
the
dancers
least
when
it
was
over
the
musicians
expected
to
escape
before
they
were
found
out
thinking
the
fun
would
be
the
greater
if
the
agnews
did
not
learn
to
whom
they
were
indebted
until
later
but
young
chester
agnew
defeated
this
he
instructed
of
his
friends
and
as
the
final
strains
were
coming
to
a
close
these
boys
laid
hold
of
the
wall
of
palms
and
pulled
it
to
pieces
the
musicians
laughing
and
protesting
were
shown
to
the
entire
company
a
great
murmur
of
surprise
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
applause
and
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
doctor
and
agnew
hurried
to
the
front
followed
by
their
daughters
who
had
already
discovered
the
truth
but
had
been
warned
by
their
brother
to
keep
quiet
about
it
my
dear
friends
exclaimed
the
is
it
possible
that
it
is
you
who
have
filled
the
gap
so
successfully
well
really
what
shall
we
say
to
such
kindness
churchill
doctor
churchill
miss
birch
all
of
you
mrs
agnew
was
saying
in
her
surprise
what
a
very
lovely
thing
to
do
it
has
been
too
kind
of
you
we
appreciate
it
more
than
we
can
tell
you
you
must
come
out
at
once
and
have
some
supper
the
evening
would
have
been
spoiled
without
you
cried
jessica
agnew
and
isabel
said
the
same
thing
chester
was
loud
in
his
praises
and
indeed
the
orchestra
received
an
ovation
which
quite
overwhelmed
it
it
went
out
to
supper
presently
escorted
by
at
least
twenty
young
people
here
come
and
sit
by
me
lucy
invited
just
in
good
humour
at
the
success
of
his
plan
you
can
keep
handing
me
food
as
i
consume
it
i
never
was
so
starved
in
my
life
well
have
you
had
a
good
time
sorry
i
had
to
desert
you
but
i
no
doubt
the
others
introduced
you
round
and
saw
that
you
were
neglected
i
think
chester
agnew
is
one
of
the
handsomest
boys
i
ever
met
whispered
lucy
has
he
the
loveliest
eyes
he
was
just
devoted
to
me
just
turned
his
mouth
full
of
chicken
and
regarded
her
with
interest
yes
his
eyes
are
wonders
he
agreed
his
own
twinkling
full
of
soul
and
all
that
you
mean
yes
they
are
though
i
never
noticed
it
till
you
pointed
it
out
lucy
looked
at
him
suspiciously
he
liked
my
dress
she
went
on
did
eh
ches
must
be
coming
on
never
knew
him
to
notice
a
dress
before
i
saw
him
looking
at
it
lucy
tone
was
impressive
and
asked
if
he
liked
pink
he
said
it
was
his
favourite
colour
h
i
must
take
lessons
of
ches
he
looked
at
me
so
much
i
was
awfully
embarrassed
said
lucy
under
her
breath
with
drooping
eyes
just
favoured
her
with
another
curious
glance
maybe
he
never
seen
just
your
kind
before
he
suggested
lucy
by
the
time
you
twenty
you
be
quite
an
old
hand
at
this
society
business
wo
you
what
makes
you
think
so
she
asked
not
sure
whether
to
be
gratified
or
not
oh
your
small
talk
is
so
well
so
er
interesting
a
fellow
always
likes
to
hear
about
another
fellow
about
his
eyes
and
so
on
oh
you
must
be
jealous
said
lucy
with
a
glance
which
finished
just
he
choked
in
his
napkin
and
turned
his
attention
to
carolyn
houghton
on
his
other
side
but
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
once
more
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
on
the
subject
of
his
sister
guest
jeff
said
he
if
a
girl
has
absolutely
no
brains
in
her
head
what
do
you
suppose
occupies
the
cavity
give
it
up
returned
jeff
sleepily
i
think
it
must
be
a
substance
of
about
the
consistency
of
a
marshmallow
mused
just
thoughtfully
i
detest
marshmallows
he
added
with
some
resentment
oh
go
to
bed
murmured
jeff
chapter
vii
nobody
at
home
eh
well
i
sorry
i
wanted
to
see
somebody
very
much
and
there
no
one
at
the
other
house
either
i
away
so
much
i
see
altogether
too
little
of
these
people
mrs
fields
thus
spoke
doctor
forester
of
the
city
the
old
friend
and
family
counselor
of
both
birches
and
churchills
his
son
frederic
who
had
managed
since
his
return
from
study
abroad
to
see
much
more
of
the
birch
household
than
his
father
was
watching
the
conversation
on
the
from
his
position
in
the
driver
place
on
doctor
forester
big
automobile
which
stood
at
the
curb
it
was
a
cool
day
in
may
and
a
light
breeze
was
blowing
i
do
know
but
miss
evelyn
in
the
house
somewhere
admitted
fields
but
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
see
her
miss
evelyn
why
certainly
i
should
please
ask
her
to
come
down
so
presently
evelyn
was
at
the
door
her
slender
hand
in
the
big
one
of
the
distinguished
gentleman
of
whom
she
stood
a
little
in
awe
all
alone
miss
evelyn
said
doctor
forester
then
suppose
you
get
your
hat
and
a
warm
jacket
and
come
with
us
fred
and
i
expected
to
pick
up
whomever
we
found
and
take
them
for
a
little
run
down
to
a
certain
place
on
the
river
such
an
invitation
was
not
to
be
resisted
doctor
churchill
and
charlotte
were
at
the
hospital
randolph
was
with
them
visiting
his
friends
and
protÃ©gÃ©s
among
the
convalescent
boys
lucy
had
gone
to
town
with
the
birches
and
nobody
knew
where
jeff
and
just
might
be
suppose
you
sit
back
in
the
tonneau
with
me
doctor
forester
suggested
fred
likes
to
be
the
whole
thing
on
the
front
seat
there
he
put
evelyn
in
and
tucked
her
up
wearing
a
cap
that
good
sense
it
spoils
my
fun
to
take
in
a
passenger
with
all
sails
spread
hello
son
what
are
you
stopping
for
oh
i
see
it
was
celia
birch
beside
whom
the
motor
was
bringing
up
with
such
a
sudden
check
to
its
speed
she
had
appeared
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
had
instantly
presented
to
the
quick
vision
of
frederic
forester
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
coming
to
a
stop
please
come
with
us
urged
that
young
man
jumping
out
we
been
to
the
house
for
you
celia
put
her
hand
to
her
head
just
as
i
am
she
asked
just
as
you
are
that
little
will
stay
on
all
right
if
it
does
i
lend
you
my
cap
will
you
keep
me
company
in
front
father
has
appropriated
miss
evelyn
behind
there
celia
mounted
to
the
seat
and
they
were
off
through
the
wide
streets
and
presently
away
in
the
country
spinning
along
at
a
rate
much
faster
than
either
passenger
realised
the
machine
was
a
fine
one
operating
with
so
little
fuss
and
fret
that
the
speed
it
was
capable
of
attaining
was
not
always
appreciated
oh
this
is
glorious
is
it
evelyn
cried
celia
over
her
shoulder
doctor
forester
glanced
from
her
to
the
young
girl
on
the
seat
beside
him
smiling
at
both
i
glad
you
put
your
trust
in
the
chauffeur
so
implicitly
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
used
to
him
but
he
proves
worthy
of
confidence
i
would
drive
my
own
machine
a
block
never
have
yes
it
delightful
to
go
whirling
along
over
the
country
in
this
way
i
suppose
you
do
know
where
i
taking
you
i
do
think
we
much
care
celia
answered
and
evelyn
nodded
both
were
and
with
the
delight
of
the
motion
the
doctor
did
not
explain
where
they
were
going
until
they
had
nearly
reached
their
destination
they
had
passed
many
fine
country
places
all
along
the
way
and
had
reached
a
fork
in
the
river
the
broad
road
leading
on
up
the
river
was
left
behind
as
they
turned
to
the
left
following
the
windings
of
the
smaller
stream
the
character
of
the
houses
along
the
way
had
changed
at
once
they
had
become
comfortable
farmhouses
with
now
and
then
a
place
of
more
modern
aspect
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
prefer
doctor
forester
announced
with
satisfaction
i
would
give
a
picayune
to
own
one
of
those
castles
back
there
but
down
here
i
going
to
show
you
my
ideal
of
comfort
fred
turned
in
at
a
gateway
and
drove
on
through
orchards
and
grove
to
a
house
behind
the
trees
on
the
river
bank
does
that
look
like
home
exclaimed
the
doctor
as
they
alighted
well
it
is
home
i
bought
it
yesterday
just
as
it
stands
nothing
fine
about
it
outside
or
in
i
wanted
it
to
run
away
to
when
i
tired
i
not
going
to
tell
anybody
about
it
except
except
every
one
he
meets
fred
said
gaily
to
celia
leading
her
toward
the
wide
porch
overlooking
the
river
about
which
the
may
vines
were
beginning
to
cluster
profusely
he
ca
keep
it
a
secret
i
may
as
well
warn
you
he
going
to
invite
you
and
the
whole
family
out
here
for
a
fortnight
in
june
so
if
you
do
want
to
come
you
have
a
chance
to
be
thinking
up
a
reasonable
excuse
as
if
we
could
want
one
what
a
charming
plan
for
us
does
he
really
mean
to
include
all
of
us
every
one
under
both
roofs
i
assure
you
it
a
jolly
plan
for
us
and
i
holding
my
breath
till
i
know
you
come
what
a
lovely
rest
it
will
be
for
charlotte
murmured
celia
thinking
at
once
as
usual
of
somebody
else
she
wo
own
it
but
she
really
had
a
pretty
hard
winter
so
i
should
imagine
for
the
first
year
of
one
married
life
afraid
i
could
be
as
hospitable
as
she
and
her
husband
not
all
at
once
you
know
do
you
think
it
paid
what
having
the
three
through
the
winter
celia
glanced
at
evelyn
who
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
porch
with
doctor
forester
was
gazing
with
happy
eyes
out
over
the
sunlit
river
oh
i
sure
charlotte
and
andy
would
both
say
so
in
evelyn
case
i
think
there
no
doubt
about
it
from
being
a
delicate
little
invalid
she
come
to
be
the
healthy
girl
you
see
there
not
very
vigorous
yet
of
course
but
in
a
fair
way
to
become
so
andy
thinks
yes
i
can
see
admitted
forester
thoughtfully
but
those
other
youngsters
celia
laughed
it
was
easy
to
think
well
of
everybody
out
here
in
this
delicious
air
and
in
the
company
of
people
she
thoroughly
liked
even
lucy
peyton
seemed
less
of
an
infliction
little
ran
has
certainly
improved
very
much
she
said
warmly
and
even
lucy
has
lucy
improved
forester
looked
at
her
with
a
quizzical
smile
the
last
time
i
saw
her
i
thought
she
was
rather
going
backward
i
met
her
by
accident
in
town
one
day
charlotte
was
shopping
and
lucy
was
waiting
she
rushed
up
to
me
as
to
a
long
lost
friend
she
practically
invited
me
to
invite
herself
and
charlotte
to
lunch
with
me
she
somewhat
grudgingly
included
charlotte
i
was
rather
taken
off
my
feet
for
an
instant
charlotte
heard
and
came
up
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
expression
on
the
face
of
andrew
churchill
i
do
know
which
felt
the
more
crushed
lucy
or
i
assure
you
i
was
anxious
to
take
them
both
to
lunch
after
that
andrew
had
made
it
so
clearly
impossible
the
perversity
of
human
desires
laughed
celia
poor
lucy
charlotte
wo
stand
the
child
absurd
affectations
come
here
and
listen
to
my
plan
called
doctor
forester
unable
to
wait
longer
to
unfold
it
so
for
the
next
the
plan
was
discussed
in
all
its
bearings
celia
proposed
at
once
that
they
keep
it
a
secret
from
charlotte
until
the
last
possible
moment
and
this
was
agreed
upon
then
evelyn
suggested
a
little
shyly
that
it
also
remain
unknown
to
jeff
he
was
to
be
graduated
from
college
about
the
middle
of
june
was
very
busy
and
hurried
and
might
appreciate
the
whole
thing
better
when
commencement
was
out
of
the
way
it
was
finally
decided
that
the
party
should
come
down
to
the
banks
upon
the
evening
of
jeff
commencement
day
and
that
to
him
and
charlotte
the
whole
arrangement
should
be
a
complete
surprise
the
date
was
only
three
weeks
ahead
and
celia
and
evelyn
birch
and
the
others
found
plenty
to
do
in
getting
ready
for
the
outing
to
say
nothing
of
seeing
that
neither
charlotte
nor
jeff
made
other
engagements
for
the
period
no
no
let
not
get
in
our
camping
so
early
in
the
season
it
be
all
over
too
soon
then
argued
just
with
his
brother
upon
just
devolved
the
task
of
heading
jeff
off
for
those
prospective
two
weeks
besides
i
an
idea
lanse
may
prefer
july
or
august
if
you
been
boning
for
examinations
the
way
i
have
retorted
jeff
your
one
idea
would
be
to
get
off
into
the
wilderness
just
as
soon
as
your
sheepskin
was
fairly
in
your
hands
i
do
see
why
you
argue
against
going
in
june
you
were
eager
enough
for
it
a
week
ago
oh
not
so
awfully
eager
i
you
were
in
a
frenzy
to
go
and
i
have
cooled
off
if
you
have
he
hopeless
just
confided
to
evelyn
his
granite
mind
is
set
on
going
camping
in
june
and
i
ca
get
him
off
it
if
you
any
little
tricks
of
persuasiveness
all
your
own
now
your
time
to
try
on
him
he
spoil
the
whole
thing
write
your
brother
lansing
to
tell
jeff
to
put
it
off
on
his
account
suggested
evelyn
that
wo
do
unfortunately
for
lanse
has
been
uncertain
about
going
all
the
time
i
try
to
think
of
something
promised
evelyn
she
had
a
chance
before
the
day
was
over
jeff
appeared
late
in
the
afternoon
and
invited
her
to
take
a
walk
with
him
i
tell
you
what
i
want
he
said
as
they
went
along
let
go
down
by
the
old
bridge
at
the
pond
and
if
there
nobody
about
i
like
to
have
you
do
me
the
favour
of
listening
while
i
spout
my
oration
would
you
mind
i
shall
be
delighted
answered
evelyn
and
this
program
was
carried
out
accordingly
down
behind
the
willows
jeff
mounted
a
prostrate
log
and
gave
vent
to
a
vigorous
and
sincere
discourse
splendid
cried
his
audience
as
he
finished
if
you
do
it
half
as
well
as
that
it
will
be
a
great
success
glad
you
think
so
jeff
descended
from
the
log
with
a
flushed
brow
and
an
air
of
relief
i
not
the
fellow
for
class
orator
i
know
but
it
and
i
do
want
to
disgrace
the
crowd
pretty
down
here
is
it
beautiful
it
makes
me
very
blue
to
think
of
leaving
it
as
if
i
ought
to
be
simply
thankful
i
could
be
here
so
long
it
was
lovely
of
your
sister
and
brother
to
insist
on
my
staying
when
my
brother
thorne
had
to
go
to
japan
so
suddenly
you
not
going
soon
jeff
looked
dismayed
two
weeks
after
your
commencement
said
evelyn
my
brother
ship
should
be
in
port
by
the
last
of
june
and
i
want
to
surprise
him
by
being
at
home
when
he
reaches
there
i
shall
leave
here
the
minute
he
gets
into
san
francisco
oh
that
too
bad
i
forgotten
there
was
any
such
thing
as
your
going
away
you
seem
why
you
seem
one
of
us
you
know
declared
jeff
as
if
there
could
be
no
stronger
bond
of
union
oh
thank
you
it
good
of
you
to
say
so
you
all
been
so
kind
i
ca
half
tell
you
how
i
appreciate
it
we
have
to
make
the
most
of
june
i
think
said
evelyn
smiling
rather
wistfully
and
looking
away
across
the
little
pond
i
should
say
so
we
have
every
sort
of
lark
we
can
think
of
the
minute
commencement
oh
i
was
going
camping
after
that
but
i
put
it
off
just
was
arguing
that
way
only
this
morning
but
i
saw
no
good
reason
for
waiting
then
now
i
do
i
sorry
to
have
you
put
it
off
protested
evelyn
with
art
you
better
go
on
with
your
plans
if
they
all
made
of
course
i
should
be
sorry
but
oh
i
put
it
off
said
jeff
decidedly
with
the
very
human
wish
to
do
the
thing
he
need
not
do
so
it
was
settled
commencement
came
rapidly
on
bringing
with
it
the
round
of
festivals
peculiar
to
that
season
jeff
insisted
on
the
presence
of
his
entire
family
at
every
event
and
for
a
week
as
charlotte
said
it
seemed
as
if
they
all
lived
in
flowered
organdies
and
white
gloves
i
really
thankful
this
is
the
last
sighed
celia
coming
over
with
her
mother
and
just
to
join
the
party
assembling
for
the
final
great
occasion
on
the
churchill
porch
evelyn
how
dear
you
look
in
that
frock
and
that
hat
is
a
dream
well
people
we
must
be
off
when
it
all
over
let
come
out
here
on
the
porch
in
the
dark
and
luxuriate
charlotte
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
spoke
that
will
be
a
rest
agreed
celia
with
a
private
pinch
of
arm
and
lucy
and
randolph
giggled
the
younger
two
had
been
let
into
the
secret
only
within
the
last
hours
fears
being
entertained
that
they
might
not
be
safe
repositories
of
mystery
celia
gave
them
a
warning
look
as
she
passed
them
and
kept
them
away
from
charlotte
during
the
car
ride
into
the
city
how
well
the
dear
boy
looks
whispered
his
family
one
to
another
as
the
class
filed
into
the
university
chapel
in
cap
and
gown
they
were
in
a
front
row
where
jeff
could
look
down
at
them
when
he
should
come
upon
the
stage
for
his
diploma
there
was
not
the
slightest
possibility
of
his
looking
either
there
or
anywhere
else
his
oration
had
been
delivered
on
class
day
and
his
remaining
part
in
the
exercises
of
graduation
was
to
listen
respectfully
to
the
distinguished
gentlemen
who
took
part
and
to
watch
with
interested
eyes
the
conferring
of
many
higher
degrees
before
it
was
time
for
himself
and
his
class
to
receive
the
sonorous
latin
address
which
ended
by
bestowing
upon
them
the
title
of
bachelor
of
arts
it
was
a
proud
moment
nevertheless
and
many
hearts
beat
high
when
it
came
down
in
that
row
near
the
front
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
watched
a
certain
erect
figure
as
if
there
were
no
others
worth
looking
at
as
all
over
the
hall
other
affectionate
eyes
watched
other
youthful
manly
forms
jeff
had
worked
hard
for
his
degree
being
not
by
nature
a
student
like
his
elder
brother
lansing
but
fonder
of
active
outdoor
life
than
of
books
he
had
been
incited
to
deeds
of
valour
in
the
classroom
only
by
the
grim
determination
not
to
disgrace
the
family
traditions
or
the
scholarly
ancestors
to
whom
he
had
often
been
pointed
back
thank
heaven
it
over
exulted
jeff
with
his
classmates
when
after
the
last
triumphant
speech
of
the
evening
the
audience
was
dismissed
to
the
strains
of
a
rejoicing
orchestra
say
fellows
i
going
to
bolt
hullo
just
ask
evelyn
for
me
if
she
wo
go
home
flying
with
me
in
the
houghton
auto
carolyn
just
sent
me
word
that
will
be
just
the
thing
whispered
celia
to
evelyn
when
the
message
came
go
with
him
but
do
let
him
stop
at
the
houghtons
whisper
it
to
carolyn
and
see
that
he
safely
on
the
porch
with
you
when
we
get
there
evelyn
nodded
and
disappeared
with
just
who
took
her
to
his
brother
now
we
off
murmured
jeff
as
he
and
evelyn
followed
carolyn
and
her
brother
out
through
a
side
entrance
what
a
night
what
a
moon
my
but
it
feels
good
to
be
out
in
the
open
air
after
that
in
there
they
had
half
an
hour
to
themselves
in
the
quiet
of
the
moonlit
porch
before
the
others
coming
by
electric
car
could
reach
home
they
filled
the
time
by
sitting
quietly
on
the
top
step
jeff
in
the
subdued
mood
of
the
young
graduate
who
sees
after
all
much
to
regret
in
the
coming
to
an
end
of
the
years
of
getting
ready
for
his
he
was
besides
not
a
little
wearied
by
the
final
examinations
preparation
for
his
part
in
commencement
and
the
closing
round
of
exercises
evelyn
herself
somewhat
fatigued
leaned
back
against
the
porch
pillar
and
gladly
kept
silence
before
the
others
came
jeff
spoke
abruptly
it
is
everybody
who
knows
when
to
let
a
fellow
be
an
oyster
he
said
gratefully
but
getting
over
the
oyster
mood
now
and
feel
like
talking
do
you
know
you
going
to
leave
an
awful
vacancy
behind
you
when
you
go
oh
no
evelyn
answered
there
are
so
many
of
you
and
you
have
such
good
times
together
you
ca
mind
much
when
a
stranger
goes
away
call
yourself
that
jeff
laughed
well
i
assure
you
we
do
too
thoroughly
one
of
us
in
the
way
of
liking
the
things
we
like
and
despising
the
things
we
despise
hullo
here
come
the
people
it
was
rather
stealing
a
march
on
them
to
race
home
in
an
auto
and
let
them
follow
by
car
was
it
let
go
make
some
lemonade
to
cheer
their
souls
all
right
evelyn
was
wondering
if
this
would
give
her
the
necessary
chance
to
change
her
dress
when
the
big
forester
automobile
rounded
the
corner
and
rolled
up
to
the
curb
just
as
the
party
from
the
car
reached
the
steps
behind
it
followed
a
second
car
of
still
more
ample
dimensions
i
come
to
take
the
whole
party
for
a
moonlight
drive
down
the
river
called
frederic
forester
go
take
off
those
cobweb
frocks
and
put
on
something
substantial
i
give
you
ten
minutes
i
the
prettiest
sight
to
show
you
you
seen
this
year
i
believe
i
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
go
said
charlotte
to
andy
as
he
followed
her
this
week
of
commencing
has
about
finished
me
ca
you
excuse
me
to
fred
you
go
with
them
if
you
like
i
do
like
without
you
doctor
churchill
was
divesting
himself
of
white
cravat
and
collar
i
know
you
worn
out
dear
but
i
think
the
ride
will
brace
you
up
it
hot
in
the
house
it
will
be
blissfully
cool
out
on
the
river
road
besides
forester
would
be
disappointed
it
is
every
night
he
comes
for
us
with
a
pair
of
autos
if
i
were
going
all
alone
with
you
in
the
runabout
sighed
charlotte
with
a
languor
unusual
to
her
i
know
i
like
that
better
myself
but
you
need
talk
on
this
trip
there
are
enough
to
keep
things
lively
without
you
you
shall
sit
next
your
big
boy
and
he
hold
your
hand
in
the
dark
urged
doctor
churchill
artfully
on
that
condition
then
and
charlotte
rose
from
among
the
pillows
where
she
had
sunk
there
was
certainly
something
very
refreshing
about
the
swift
motion
in
the
june
air
leaning
against
her
husband
shoulder
charlotte
began
to
rest
it
had
been
a
busy
week
the
heat
had
been
of
that
first
unbearable
high
temperature
of
with
which
some
seasons
assault
us
and
young
churchill
had
felt
her
responsibilities
more
heavily
than
ever
before
as
the
car
flew
down
the
river
road
she
shut
her
eyes
why
where
are
we
turning
in
charlotte
opened
her
eyes
she
had
been
almost
asleep
soothed
by
the
cool
and
quiet
look
ahead
through
the
trees
doctor
churchill
said
in
her
ear
and
charlotte
sat
up
she
saw
on
the
river
bank
far
ahead
a
low
house
with
long
porches
hung
thickly
with
chinese
lanterns
each
window
glowed
with
one
of
the
swinging
globes
and
long
lines
of
them
stretched
off
among
the
trees
at
one
side
gleamed
two
white
tents
and
in
front
of
these
burned
bonfires
what
is
it
it
must
be
a
lawn
party
but
we
not
dressed
for
it
murmured
charlotte
her
eyes
wide
open
now
just
then
a
tremendous
shout
from
the
automobile
in
front
rang
through
the
grove
their
own
car
ran
up
to
the
steps
where
stood
doctor
forester
and
john
lansing
birch
under
the
lanterns
both
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
white
welcome
to
banks
the
doctor
cried
charlotte
my
dear
why
this
expression
of
amazement
you
only
come
to
my
house
party
my
woods
party
my
river
party
for
a
fortnight
all
of
you
will
you
stay
or
are
you
going
to
sit
staring
down
at
us
with
those
big
black
eyes
forever
i
think
i
stay
said
charlotte
happily
slipping
down
from
the
car
into
her
brother
outstretched
arms
o
lanse
o
lanse
it
good
to
see
you
a
surprise
chapter
viii
charlotte
swung
herself
up
into
the
runabout
as
doctor
churchill
paused
for
her
at
the
gateway
of
the
banks
she
had
met
him
here
at
six
every
day
since
they
came
and
this
was
the
seventh
day
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
get
through
his
round
of
work
earlier
but
he
was
enjoying
his
evenings
and
nights
in
the
country
with
a
zest
almost
sufficient
to
make
up
for
the
daytime
hours
he
missed
charlotte
however
although
she
joined
merrily
in
all
that
went
on
through
the
day
was
never
so
happy
as
when
this
hour
arrived
and
dressed
in
cool
white
for
the
evening
she
could
slip
away
and
walk
slowly
down
this
winding
road
through
the
orchard
and
the
grove
to
the
gateway
here
she
waited
in
a
shady
nook
for
the
first
puff
of
the
coming
motor
the
moment
she
heard
it
she
sprang
out
into
the
roadway
and
stood
waving
her
handkerchief
in
response
to
a
swinging
cap
far
up
the
road
then
came
the
nearer
salutation
the
quick
climb
into
the
small
car
assisted
by
the
grip
of
andy
hand
and
the
eager
greeting
of
two
pairs
of
eyes
do
you
know
this
outing
is
doing
you
a
world
of
good
already
said
doctor
churchill
noting
with
approval
the
fresh
colour
in
face
i
know
it
is
i
did
realise
that
i
needed
it
a
bit
until
i
actually
found
myself
here
with
nothing
to
do
except
rest
and
play
it
doing
everybody
good
you
should
have
heard
the
plans
at
breakfast
although
it
been
so
hot
nobody
has
been
idle
a
minute
i
been
fishing
all
day
with
lanse
and
fred
and
celia
andy
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
admit
i
did
think
it
till
lanse
put
it
into
my
head
but
i
believe
he
right
fred
is
going
to
want
celia
of
course
that
was
a
foregone
conclusion
from
the
start
andy
churchill
you
were
so
discerning
as
all
that
when
not
even
i
thought
it
was
serious
with
either
of
them
celia
had
so
many
admirers
and
turned
them
all
aside
so
coolly
and
frederic
forester
is
such
an
accomplished
person
at
paying
attentions
how
could
i
think
it
meant
anything
but
lanse
insists
celia
is
different
from
what
she
ever
was
before
and
i
do
know
but
he
right
to
be
sure
he
right
next
to
you
i
never
saw
a
more
attractive
young
person
than
celia
what
a
charming
colour
you
have
child
to
be
sure
you
have
burned
the
tip
of
that
small
greek
nose
a
very
little
but
i
find
even
that
adorable
charlotte
stop
pinching
my
arm
if
you
half
as
glad
to
have
me
get
here
as
i
am
to
arrive
you
pretty
happy
i
laid
stern
commands
on
fields
not
to
telephone
unless
it
were
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
so
i
pretty
sure
of
not
being
disturbed
they
found
supper
laid
on
the
piazza
and
enjoyed
it
with
keen
appetites
afterward
they
spent
an
hour
drifting
on
the
river
followed
by
a
long
and
delightful
evening
on
the
lawn
at
the
river
bank
celia
and
lanse
picked
the
strings
of
violin
and
viola
and
the
others
sang
doctor
forester
in
his
white
clothes
lay
stretched
on
a
rustic
seat
and
professed
himself
to
be
having
the
time
of
his
life
i
do
think
the
rest
of
us
are
far
behind
you
declared
lanse
if
you
people
had
been
digging
away
at
law
in
a
hot
old
office
you
think
this
was
paradise
evelyn
looking
out
over
the
moonlit
river
drew
a
little
sigh
which
she
meant
nobody
to
hear
but
jeff
divined
it
and
whispered
under
cover
of
an
extravaganza
from
just
in
regard
to
the
night
the
company
and
the
occasion
you
coming
again
next
summer
you
know
and
all
winter
we
write
about
it
shall
we
do
you
think
you
will
have
time
to
write
she
asked
have
time
i
should
say
i
would
make
time
he
murmured
think
going
to
stand
having
this
sort
of
thing
cut
off
short
i
guess
not
unless
you
the
one
who
has
time
and
even
then
i
do
think
i
could
be
kept
from
boring
you
with
letters
i
shall
certainly
want
to
hear
what
you
all
are
doing
she
answered
she
was
thinking
about
this
plan
when
she
went
to
bed
an
hour
later
jeff
had
stopped
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
say
i
just
like
a
good
secure
promise
from
you
about
that
enjoy
the
time
that
left
a
lot
better
if
i
know
it
is
coming
to
a
regular
place
at
the
end
will
you
promise
to
write
regularly
she
paused
on
the
bottom
step
where
she
was
just
on
a
level
with
the
straightforward
dark
eyes
half
boy
half
man
which
met
hers
with
the
clear
look
of
good
comradeship
there
was
no
sentimentality
in
the
gaze
but
undeniably
strong
liking
and
respect
she
answered
in
own
spirit
i
promise
i
really
should
know
how
to
do
without
hearing
about
your
plans
and
the
things
that
happen
to
you
i
not
a
very
good
but
i
try
to
tell
you
things
that
will
interest
you
good
i
no
flowery
expert
myself
but
i
fancy
we
can
write
as
we
talk
and
that
enough
for
me
happy
dreams
she
responded
and
went
on
turning
to
wave
at
jeff
from
the
landing
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
preparing
to
go
out
to
the
tents
where
he
and
just
doctor
forester
frederic
and
lanse
were
spending
these
dry
june
nights
evelyn
went
on
to
the
odd
old
bedroom
under
the
gable
where
she
and
lucy
were
quartered
together
she
found
lucy
lying
so
still
that
she
thought
her
asleep
and
so
made
ready
for
bed
with
speed
and
quiet
remembering
that
lucy
had
been
first
to
come
in
and
imagining
her
tired
with
the
day
sports
evelyn
herself
did
not
go
at
once
to
sleep
there
were
too
many
pleasant
things
to
think
of
for
that
and
although
her
eyes
began
to
close
at
last
she
was
yet
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
awake
when
lucy
stirred
softly
beside
her
and
sat
up
in
bed
after
a
moment
the
younger
girl
slipped
out
to
the
floor
using
such
care
that
evelyn
thought
her
making
unusual
and
kindly
effort
not
to
disturb
her
bedfellow
after
a
little
as
lucy
did
not
return
evelyn
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
out
into
the
moonlight
lucy
was
dressing
so
rapidly
and
noiselessly
that
evelyn
watched
her
amazed
she
was
on
the
point
of
asking
if
the
girl
were
ill
when
she
observed
that
lucy
was
putting
on
the
delicate
dress
and
gay
ribbons
she
had
worn
during
the
evening
and
was
even
arranging
her
hair
something
prompted
evelyn
to
lie
still
for
in
all
the
winter
association
she
had
never
grown
quite
to
trust
lucy
or
to
like
her
ways
more
than
any
one
else
however
she
herself
had
won
the
other
liking
and
had
come
to
feel
a
certain
responsibility
for
her
so
when
lucy
after
making
wholly
ready
had
stolen
to
the
door
let
herself
out
and
closed
it
silently
behind
her
evelyn
sprang
out
of
bed
perhaps
lucy
simply
could
not
sleep
she
said
to
herself
and
had
gone
down
to
sit
on
the
lower
porch
or
lie
in
one
of
the
hammocks
swinging
under
the
trees
the
night
was
exceedingly
warm
even
the
usual
cooling
breath
from
the
river
being
absent
that
all
there
is
of
it
said
evelyn
reassuringly
to
herself
although
at
the
same
time
she
felt
uneasiness
enough
to
send
her
out
into
the
hall
to
a
gable
window
over
the
porch
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
camp
nothing
stirring
was
to
be
seen
except
the
dwindling
flame
of
the
evening
burned
every
night
for
cheer
not
for
warmth
evelyn
crept
to
a
side
window
as
she
reached
it
a
white
figure
could
be
seen
hurrying
away
through
the
orchard
back
in
her
room
evelyn
dressed
with
as
much
haste
as
lucy
had
done
if
with
less
care
instead
of
the
white
frock
of
the
evening
however
she
put
on
a
dark
blue
linen
for
she
was
sure
that
she
must
follow
lucy
and
discover
what
this
strange
departure
stealthily
made
at
midnight
could
mean
she
went
down
to
the
front
door
the
moment
she
opened
it
a
tall
figure
started
up
from
one
of
the
long
lounging
chairs
there
and
jeff
voice
said
softly
charlotte
no
it
evelyn
she
whispered
back
do
be
surprised
i
thought
everybody
in
the
camp
was
asleep
i
was
sleepy
and
thought
i
lounge
here
till
i
was
what
the
matter
anybody
sick
no
i
just
going
for
a
little
walk
walk
at
this
hour
ca
you
sleep
but
you
must
go
and
walk
alone
you
know
i
go
with
you
she
did
not
want
to
tell
him
but
she
saw
no
other
way
it
lucy
she
explained
hurriedly
she
dressed
and
gone
out
somewhere
and
i
ca
think
why
it
frightened
me
and
i
going
to
follow
her
no
you
stay
here
and
i
follow
which
way
did
she
go
what
can
she
be
up
to
that
girl
a
queer
one
and
i
thought
so
from
the
first
no
no
there
some
explanation
it
may
be
she
walks
in
her
sleep
you
know
though
i
sure
she
never
done
it
this
winter
let
me
go
jeff
she
get
too
far
she
took
the
path
toward
the
river
oh
if
it
be
i
guess
it
not
jeff
tone
was
skeptical
but
evelyn
had
started
away
at
a
run
and
jeff
was
after
her
the
two
hastened
along
with
light
noiseless
steps
at
the
bottom
of
the
path
on
the
very
brink
of
the
river
was
an
old
looking
out
over
the
water
it
was
a
favourite
retreat
for
the
and
the
landing
were
but
a
rod
away
and
after
a
row
on
the
river
the
shaded
was
a
pleasant
place
in
which
to
linger
hush
breathed
evelyn
stopping
short
as
they
neared
the
they
advanced
with
caution
and
presently
as
they
drew
within
speaking
distance
of
the
little
structure
they
saw
a
figure
emerge
from
it
and
stand
just
outside
jeff
drew
evelyn
quickly
and
silently
into
the
shelter
of
a
cluster
of
hemlocks
after
a
space
the
dip
of
oars
lightly
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
soon
a
pulled
quietly
into
view
with
one
dark
figure
outlined
against
the
gleam
of
the
moonlit
water
evelyn
caught
a
smothered
sound
from
jeff
whether
of
recognition
or
of
displeasure
she
could
not
tell
she
felt
her
own
pulses
throbbing
with
excitement
and
anxiety
the
stranger
pulled
in
to
the
landing
noiselessly
shipped
his
oars
jumped
out
and
made
fast
lucy
came
cautiously
down
to
the
wharf
and
against
the
radiance
of
the
moonlight
on
the
river
the
two
behind
the
trees
could
see
the
greeting
the
slight
boyish
figure
which
met
lucy
had
a
familiar
look
to
jeff
but
he
could
not
tell
with
any
certainty
whose
it
might
be
that
it
was
youthful
there
could
be
no
question
even
in
the
dim
light
the
diffidence
of
both
boy
and
girl
could
be
plainly
observed
young
idiots
exploded
jeff
between
his
teeth
as
the
two
they
were
watching
sat
down
side
by
side
on
the
steps
of
the
where
only
their
heads
were
visible
to
the
watchers
heads
decidedly
close
together
then
he
bent
close
to
evelyn
ear
and
whispered
come
farther
back
with
me
and
we
decide
what
to
do
with
the
utmost
caution
the
two
made
their
retreat
at
a
safe
distance
jeff
halted
and
said
rapidly
i
think
the
best
thing
will
be
for
you
to
go
back
to
bed
and
to
sleep
if
you
can
at
any
rate
do
let
her
know
that
you
hear
her
come
in
i
come
back
here
and
mount
guard
i
wo
let
them
see
me
i
take
care
that
lucy
gets
safely
back
to
the
house
and
i
wo
interfere
unless
she
attempts
to
go
off
in
the
boat
with
him
or
do
some
fool
thing
like
that
you
need
worry
they
going
to
run
away
and
get
married
she
just
full
of
sentimental
nonsense
and
thinks
it
romantic
and
to
steal
out
in
the
night
to
meet
some
idiot
of
a
boy
you
can
see
that
all
he
is
by
his
build
probably
somebody
we
know
do
you
think
that
the
best
plan
yes
for
agreed
evelyn
in
a
troubled
whisper
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
talk
to
her
when
she
comes
in
though
if
you
do
you
just
make
her
angry
the
thing
is
to
let
her
go
uncaught
until
we
can
think
what
to
do
little
simpleton
i
do
as
you
say
but
do
be
hard
on
her
jeff
she
just
silly
she
has
been
brought
up
like
your
sisters
or
like
you
thought
jeff
as
he
watched
the
figure
before
him
flit
away
toward
the
house
he
followed
at
a
distance
till
he
saw
the
door
close
on
evelyn
then
he
went
back
to
his
post
the
next
morning
as
he
and
evelyn
walked
down
the
road
through
the
toward
the
gateway
to
open
the
which
stood
just
outside
the
gate
jeff
told
evelyn
what
he
had
found
out
nothing
more
serious
than
a
simple
case
of
spoon
he
said
with
an
expression
at
which
evelyn
might
have
laughed
if
she
had
not
felt
so
disturbed
the
boy
turned
out
to
be
our
next
neighbour
here
made
another
appointment
for
he
thinks
it
a
great
lark
probably
will
brag
about
it
to
all
the
boys
he
got
to
eat
his
little
dish
of
humble
pie
too
evelyn
i
a
plan
will
you
trust
me
to
carry
it
out
she
looked
at
him
in
her
face
was
written
a
concern
for
lucy
so
tender
that
jeff
adored
her
for
it
at
the
same
time
he
hastened
to
assure
her
that
it
was
needless
if
you
merely
talk
with
her
i
do
think
that
will
do
it
he
said
decidedly
she
been
with
you
all
winter
has
seen
just
how
a
girl
should
behave
he
did
not
know
what
a
thrill
of
happiness
this
bluntly
sincere
compliment
gave
his
hearer
and
she
has
taken
it
in
a
bit
she
needs
something
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
i
rather
not
tell
you
my
plan
for
if
you
can
assure
her
afterward
that
you
were
in
it
you
can
do
her
more
good
than
if
she
as
provoked
at
you
as
she
sure
to
be
at
me
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
not
do
a
thing
to
frighten
her
or
play
any
fool
practical
jokes
i
have
to
let
just
into
the
secret
i
think
but
nobody
else
will
you
trust
me
of
course
i
will
said
the
girl
quickly
on
just
one
condition
jeff
think
of
her
as
if
she
were
your
own
sister
and
do
do
be
funny
as
i
can
no
i
wo
evelyn
observed
lucy
all
that
day
with
understanding
and
found
herself
longing
to
warn
the
girl
that
her
foolishness
was
about
to
meet
with
its
punishment
she
noted
with
sorrow
the
strangely
excited
look
in
the
young
eyes
the
light
laugh
the
changing
colour
in
the
pretty
face
lucy
promise
of
beauty
had
never
seemed
to
her
so
characterless
or
her
words
so
empty
of
sense
she
found
her
in
a
corner
of
their
room
reading
a
worn
novel
by
a
certain
author
whose
very
name
she
had
been
taught
to
regard
as
a
synonym
for
vapidity
and
sentimentalism
of
the
most
highly
flavoured
sort
and
she
could
not
keep
back
a
quick
exclamation
at
sight
of
it
lucy
looked
up
with
a
frown
and
a
flush
i
suppose
you
think
it
terrible
to
read
novels
she
said
pettishly
flirting
the
leaves
well
i
do
dear
it
not
that
i
been
taught
to
despise
but
the
sort
of
novel
that
writer
writes
i
do
know
anything
about
them
myself
but
i
saw
my
brother
thorne
once
put
that
one
you
reading
in
the
stove
and
jam
on
the
cover
as
if
he
were
afraid
it
would
get
out
do
you
wonder
i
do
like
to
see
lucy
peyton
reading
it
asked
evelyn
gently
with
her
cheek
against
the
other
girl
he
must
be
a
terrible
miss
nancy
then
said
lucy
defiantly
not
a
thing
in
it
that
could
be
in
a
book
the
heroine
is
the
sweetest
thing
if
she
is
she
wo
mind
your
putting
her
down
and
coming
out
for
a
walk
with
me
answered
evelyn
with
a
smile
which
might
have
captivated
lucy
if
she
had
seen
it
but
the
younger
girl
got
up
and
flung
away
out
of
the
room
murmuring
that
she
did
not
feel
like
walking
and
would
take
herself
and
her
book
where
they
would
not
bother
people
evelyn
looked
after
her
with
a
little
sigh
and
owned
that
jeff
might
be
right
in
thinking
that
mere
gentle
argument
with
lucy
would
have
scant
effect
on
a
head
full
of
nonsense
or
a
heart
whose
love
for
the
sweet
and
true
had
had
far
too
little
development
half
an
hour
before
the
time
set
for
the
rendezvous
at
the
that
night
jeff
and
just
walked
down
the
path
shoulder
to
shoulder
talking
under
their
breath
just
being
younger
was
even
more
deeply
interested
than
his
brother
in
the
prospective
encounter
and
received
his
final
instructions
with
glee
all
right
he
gurgled
i
to
give
him
a
good
scare
in
the
shape
of
a
lecture
with
a
thrashing
promised
if
he
cuts
up
any
more
he
to
give
his
word
on
pain
of
a
lot
of
things
not
to
give
any
of
this
little
performance
of
his
away
to
a
soul
then
he
to
be
forbidden
the
premises
while
miss
peyton
is
on
them
i
understand
well
now
look
here
warned
jeff
i
give
you
leave
but
mind
you
i
trust
your
discretion
too
you
never
can
tell
what
these
will
do
dignity
your
cue
be
stern
as
an
avenging
fate
but
do
get
to
cuffing
him
round
and
batting
him
with
language
just
because
bigger
you
look
here
expostulated
just
aggrieved
you
picked
me
out
for
this
job
now
leave
it
to
me
i
have
the
boy
saying
to
me
before
i
get
through
just
ran
down
to
the
got
out
a
slim
craft
launched
it
and
was
about
rowing
away
when
he
bethought
himself
of
something
he
pulled
in
to
the
landing
made
fast
his
painter
and
ran
like
a
deer
up
to
the
house
he
was
back
in
five
minutes
do
believe
i
go
by
boat
after
all
he
whispered
to
jeff
standing
in
the
door
it
might
be
simpler
not
to
have
a
boat
to
bother
with
i
just
leave
the
tied
there
and
put
her
up
when
i
get
back
he
was
off
before
jeff
could
reply
jeff
started
toward
the
boat
to
put
it
up
but
stopped
considering
lucy
would
think
it
that
of
her
admirer
and
would
be
all
the
more
sure
to
keep
her
appointment
he
left
it
as
it
was
swinging
lightly
on
the
water
six
feet
out
it
was
a
habit
of
just
to
moor
a
boat
at
the
length
of
her
painter
to
prevent
her
bumping
against
the
rough
old
landing
lucy
coming
swiftly
down
the
path
fifteen
minutes
later
saw
the
boat
and
hastened
her
steps
she
did
not
observe
that
this
was
a
slimmer
longer
craft
than
the
boat
george
jarvis
was
using
she
reached
the
landing
and
looked
about
of
course
he
was
in
the
she
went
to
it
her
skirts
which
she
had
of
late
been
surreptitiously
lengthening
held
daintily
in
her
hand
as
she
came
close
a
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
before
she
could
be
frightened
by
the
realisation
that
it
was
not
jarvis
slender
young
frame
which
confronted
her
jeff
accosted
her
in
the
mildest
tones
imaginable
it
only
jefferson
birch
do
be
scared
fine
night
is
it
stammered
lucy
in
dismay
she
stood
still
her
skirts
gathered
close
as
if
she
were
about
to
run
do
go
out
for
a
stroll
so
am
i
said
jeff
pleasantly
as
if
midnight
promenades
were
the
accustomed
thing
at
the
banks
wo
you
sit
down
there
were
seats
outside
the
as
well
as
within
and
he
motioned
toward
one
of
them
no
thank
you
i
think
i
go
back
said
lucy
and
her
voice
trembled
why
you
only
just
come
why
not
stay
a
while
and
have
a
visit
with
me
you
must
have
been
intending
to
stay
oh
no
said
lucy
eagerly
and
stopped
short
listening
what
if
george
jarvis
should
come
round
the
corner
at
any
moment
she
must
get
jeff
away
with
her
wo
you
walk
along
up
to
the
house
with
me
i
only
came
down
to
see
if
i
left
something
in
the
jeff
had
planned
what
he
would
say
to
her
but
at
this
his
disgust
got
the
better
of
him
lucy
said
he
and
his
voice
had
changed
from
lightness
to
gravity
do
you
mind
a
bit
what
is
chapter
ix
what
do
you
mean
jefferson
birch
by
saying
such
a
thing
lucy
tone
was
one
of
mingled
anger
and
fright
i
mean
said
jeff
coolly
that
if
coming
down
here
to
meet
george
jarvis
were
what
you
were
proud
of
doing
you
would
try
to
cover
it
up
do
you
know
lu
i
tremendously
sorry
you
find
any
fun
in
a
thing
like
that
dear
me
lucy
tried
hard
to
assume
her
usual
manner
who
appointed
you
guardian
of
young
ladies
the
trouble
is
well
you
not
a
young
lady
yet
you
only
a
girl
if
you
were
a
real
young
lady
there
be
nothing
i
could
do
about
your
stealing
out
at
this
late
hour
to
meet
a
young
man
except
to
laugh
and
think
my
own
thoughts
but
since
you
only
a
girl
you
can
insult
me
lucy
was
very
near
tears
now
angry
mortified
tears
i
do
mean
to
insult
you
and
i
think
you
know
that
if
anybody
has
insulted
you
it
the
boy
who
asked
you
to
meet
him
here
he
must
have
been
the
one
to
propose
it
of
course
and
you
thought
it
would
be
fun
lu
when
i
found
this
out
i
should
have
gone
straight
to
my
sister
charlotte
and
told
her
to
come
and
meet
you
here
instead
of
myself
if
i
had
known
how
it
would
disappoint
her
she
would
have
taken
it
to
heart
much
more
seriously
than
you
can
realise
she
entertained
you
all
winter
and
spring
and
the
responsibilities
of
looking
after
you
and
ran
have
been
heavy
on
her
shoulders
she
tried
hard
to
give
you
a
good
time
too
lucy
turned
and
walked
deliberately
away
down
the
path
toward
the
i
bungling
it
thought
jeff
uncomfortably
and
stood
still
waiting
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
let
evelyn
tackle
the
business
after
all
lucy
walked
out
upon
the
landing
where
the
swung
lazily
in
the
wash
of
the
current
suddenly
quite
without
warning
she
ran
the
length
of
the
little
pier
and
leaped
for
the
boat
it
had
looked
an
easy
distance
but
as
she
made
the
jump
she
realised
too
late
that
the
interval
of
water
between
pier
and
boat
was
wider
than
it
had
looked
in
the
moonlight
with
a
scream
and
a
splash
she
went
down
and
an
instant
later
jeff
dashing
down
the
pier
saw
only
a
widening
circle
gleaming
faintly
on
the
water
he
flung
off
his
coat
tore
off
his
low
shoes
and
waited
the
shelved
suddenly
just
where
the
pier
ended
and
the
depth
was
fully
twenty
feet
moment
after
moment
went
by
while
he
watched
breathlessly
for
the
appearance
of
the
girl
at
the
surface
the
current
was
strong
a
few
feet
out
and
his
gaze
swept
the
water
for
some
distance
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
break
in
the
surface
which
told
him
what
he
wanted
it
was
even
farther
than
he
had
calculated
i
must
risk
this
alone
he
thought
quickly
and
gave
several
ringing
shouts
for
just
whom
he
knew
to
be
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
then
he
made
his
plunge
swimming
furiously
to
get
below
the
place
where
the
girl
form
had
risen
that
he
might
be
at
hand
when
his
chance
came
again
the
current
helped
him
and
so
did
the
moonlight
on
the
water
it
was
in
the
very
centre
of
a
glinting
spot
of
light
that
lucy
came
to
the
surface
the
second
time
before
she
had
sunk
out
of
sight
jeff
had
her
by
the
skirts
and
was
working
desperately
to
get
her
head
above
water
she
was
struggling
with
all
her
fierce
young
strength
crazed
with
fright
and
suffocation
and
she
continually
dragged
him
under
in
her
blind
attempts
to
pull
herself
up
by
him
when
he
could
get
breath
he
shouted
again
and
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
age
there
came
a
response
from
two
directions
just
running
along
the
river
bank
and
doctor
churchill
plunging
down
the
hill
saw
and
were
coming
to
the
rescue
hold
on
hold
on
i
coming
both
shouted
as
they
ran
doctor
churchill
having
the
easier
course
reached
the
bank
first
being
clad
only
in
his
pajamas
he
was
unburdened
by
superfluous
clothing
with
a
long
leap
he
was
in
the
water
and
with
a
vigorous
strokes
he
had
reached
jeff
elbow
let
go
i
got
her
he
cried
and
jeff
spluttering
and
breathing
hard
attempted
to
let
go
but
lucy
still
fought
so
desperately
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
her
clutch
away
from
jeff
clothing
by
this
time
however
just
was
also
in
the
water
and
the
three
soon
had
the
girl
under
control
keep
quiet
you
all
right
let
us
take
you
in
called
doctor
churchill
to
the
struggling
strangling
little
figure
so
in
a
minute
more
they
had
her
on
the
bank
why
it
lucy
doctor
churchill
cried
in
astonishment
as
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
beside
her
and
fell
to
work
yes
it
lucy
panted
jeff
but
there
was
no
chance
just
then
for
explanations
for
the
next
ten
minutes
he
and
just
were
kept
busy
obeying
peremptory
orders
as
under
andy
directions
they
silently
and
anxiously
worked
over
the
young
form
upon
the
grass
they
were
feeling
intensely
grateful
that
the
necessary
skill
had
been
so
close
at
hand
but
until
the
doctor
satisfied
coming
out
all
right
gave
them
leave
neither
dared
draw
a
good
breath
for
himself
just
was
wondering
what
he
and
jeff
were
to
say
but
his
brother
was
heaping
reproaches
upon
himself
and
sternly
holding
jeff
birch
responsible
for
the
whole
unfortunate
affair
by
the
time
lucy
was
herself
again
and
able
to
breathe
without
distress
evelyn
had
come
flying
down
the
path
only
other
person
roused
by
the
distant
shouts
it
had
been
a
day
full
of
active
sports
and
everybody
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
weary
even
charlotte
had
not
been
roused
by
andy
departure
just
ran
to
the
house
for
blankets
evelyn
at
doctor
direction
followed
him
to
prepare
a
steaming
hot
drink
for
lucy
and
presently
they
had
her
in
her
bed
warm
and
dry
although
much
exhausted
by
her
experience
in
the
waters
of
the
river
which
were
cold
even
on
a
june
night
doctor
churchill
had
insisted
on
calling
charlotte
but
evelyn
had
begged
him
to
arouse
nobody
else
and
after
one
look
into
her
face
he
had
agreed
at
last
lucy
having
dropped
off
to
sleep
under
the
soothing
influence
of
the
hot
beverage
the
others
gathered
quietly
in
a
lower
room
the
three
wet
ones
had
acquired
dry
if
informal
garments
and
a
council
had
been
asked
for
by
evelyn
it
entirely
my
fault
began
jeff
promptly
and
he
plunged
into
a
brief
but
graphic
account
of
the
accident
it
not
in
the
least
your
fault
evelyn
interrupted
at
last
as
jeff
came
to
a
pause
with
a
repetition
of
his
it
mine
if
anybody
i
should
have
taken
the
whole
thing
to
churchill
at
once
instead
of
trying
to
keep
it
quiet
my
meeting
her
down
there
alone
was
entirely
my
plan
began
jeff
again
but
this
time
it
was
his
sister
charlotte
who
interrupted
neither
of
you
is
in
the
least
to
blame
my
dears
she
said
smiling
on
them
both
you
had
the
best
of
motives
and
the
plan
might
have
worked
out
well
but
for
the
child
sudden
mad
idea
of
jumping
into
that
boat
i
suppose
she
meant
to
row
away
she
did
stop
to
cast
off
she
could
have
got
away
before
i
should
have
been
in
the
boat
too
objected
jeff
that
simply
shows
how
out
of
her
head
with
excitement
she
was
but
that
all
over
she
mercifully
was
drowned
a
little
involuntary
shiver
passed
over
the
speaker
and
we
hope
for
no
serious
consequences
the
thing
now
is
to
think
how
to
act
when
she
wakes
in
the
morning
i
should
say
treat
the
whole
thing
for
what
it
is
a
childish
escapade
show
her
the
silliness
of
it
and
then
let
it
drop
said
doctor
churchill
charlotte
looked
at
him
appealingly
lucy
and
ran
go
home
next
week
she
said
slowly
i
hoped
i
wanted
so
much
to
send
lucy
away
with
i
ca
express
it
a
little
bit
higher
ideals
than
any
she
has
known
before
i
thought
we
were
succeeding
she
has
seemed
more
considerate
and
less
she
certainly
has
evelyn
agreed
quickly
and
the
two
looked
at
each
other
there
was
an
instant
silence
then
just
spoke
how
do
you
know
but
you
find
her
quite
a
different
proposition
when
she
wakes
up
a
plunge
like
that
is
a
sobering
sort
of
experience
i
should
say
for
a
girl
who
ca
swim
she
may
be
the
meekest
thing
on
earth
after
this
if
it
does
her
as
much
good
as
a
lively
dressing
down
did
george
jarvis
she
likely
to
be
a
changed
girl
they
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
satisfaction
in
the
boy
voice
he
may
be
right
admitted
doctor
churchill
at
any
rate
if
lucy
is
ill
let
tell
nobody
what
has
happened
the
poor
child
certainly
does
need
any
more
humiliation
just
at
present
and
i
like
to
spare
her
all
i
can
charlotte
spoke
decidedly
they
agreed
to
this
evelyn
went
to
her
place
beside
lucy
planning
an
affectionate
greeting
when
the
younger
girl
should
wake
and
charlotte
when
she
fell
asleep
dreamed
of
lucy
until
morning
it
was
quite
a
different
lucy
who
met
them
all
in
the
morning
she
showed
no
ill
effects
except
a
slight
languor
and
when
charlotte
had
established
her
in
a
hammock
on
the
porch
she
lay
there
with
a
quiet
sober
face
which
showed
that
she
had
been
doing
some
thinking
when
jeff
approached
with
his
most
deferential
manner
to
inquire
after
her
welfare
she
astonished
him
by
saying
more
simply
and
sweetly
than
he
had
dreamed
possible
i
want
to
tell
you
i
wo
forget
what
you
did
for
me
last
night
i
was
foolish
i
suppose
i
i
did
think
what
i
was
doing
was
any
harm
but
i
she
choked
a
little
and
felt
for
her
handkerchief
jeff
grasped
her
hand
he
had
a
warm
heart
and
he
had
not
got
over
the
thought
of
how
he
should
have
felt
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
rescue
the
girl
he
had
attempted
to
lecture
his
answer
to
lucy
was
very
gentle
we
never
think
of
it
again
i
awfully
thankful
it
all
ended
well
if
you
forgive
me
for
frightening
you
i
say
that
i
sure
really
a
sensible
little
girl
and
i
sha
lie
awake
nights
worrying
over
your
taking
midnight
strolls
his
tone
was
not
priggish
and
his
smile
was
so
bright
that
lucy
took
heart
of
grace
and
said
earnestly
you
need
i
do
want
any
more
and
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
but
it
was
not
to
cry
for
evelyn
came
by
jeff
called
to
her
and
between
them
they
soon
had
lucy
smiling
before
the
day
was
over
she
had
had
a
little
talk
with
charlotte
in
which
the
young
married
woman
came
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
girl
that
she
had
ever
succeeded
in
doing
before
and
lucy
had
learned
one
or
two
simple
lessons
she
never
forgot
but
it
the
first
and
last
time
i
ever
attempt
the
education
of
the
young
girl
declared
jeff
solemnly
to
evelyn
that
afternoon
as
they
gathered
armfuls
of
june
roses
for
the
decoration
of
the
porch
do
feel
too
badly
lucy
is
going
to
value
your
respect
very
much
after
this
and
i
think
you
be
able
to
give
it
to
her
a
girl
who
has
no
older
brother
misses
a
great
deal
i
think
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
mine
answered
evelyn
reaching
up
to
pull
at
a
pink
cluster
far
above
her
head
let
me
get
that
for
you
and
jeff
long
arm
easily
grasped
the
spray
and
drew
it
down
to
her
well
i
owe
a
lot
to
my
sisters
that
sure
with
quite
a
knightly
air
he
cut
the
fairest
bud
at
hand
and
gave
it
to
her
saying
quietly
you
would
like
it
if
i
said
anything
soft
and
sentimental
but
you
wo
mind
if
i
tell
you
that
you
seem
to
me
a
lot
like
that
bud
there
that
going
to
blossom
some
day
he
knew
it
pleased
her
for
the
ready
colour
told
him
so
but
she
answered
lightly
as
yet
i
quite
content
to
be
only
a
bud
your
sister
celia
is
the
opening
rose
is
she
lovely
here
one
just
like
her
take
it
to
her
and
tell
her
i
said
so
will
you
she
plucked
the
rose
and
motioned
to
where
celia
was
coming
alone
along
the
orchard
road
frederic
forester
having
just
left
her
for
a
hasty
trip
to
town
jeff
laughed
took
the
rose
and
the
message
and
brought
back
celia
thanks
evelyn
met
him
with
her
full
basket
and
the
was
over
she
says
to
tell
you
you
a
flatterer
but
being
a
woman
she
likes
it
and
you
said
jeff
taking
her
basket
away
doctor
forester
party
had
lasted
eight
days
now
and
his
guests
were
planning
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
remaining
when
doctor
churchill
came
spinning
out
in
the
middle
of
a
thursday
morning
with
a
letter
peyton
had
sent
word
that
randolph
and
lucy
were
to
meet
her
in
a
distant
city
hours
ride
away
from
there
the
trio
were
to
proceed
to
their
home
they
will
have
to
leave
this
evening
in
order
to
make
it
doctor
churchill
announced
this
letter
has
barely
allowed
time
a
little
characteristic
of
cousin
lula
which
i
remember
of
old
she
has
an
idea
that
time
and
tide
if
they
wait
for
no
man
can
sometimes
be
prevailed
upon
to
change
their
schedule
on
account
of
a
woman
upon
hearing
the
news
lucy
burst
into
tears
she
did
not
want
to
go
she
did
not
want
to
go
so
soon
more
than
all
she
was
afraid
to
go
alone
undoubtedly
some
one
can
be
found
who
is
going
the
same
way
the
letter
read
easily
and
in
any
case
you
can
put
them
in
charge
of
the
railroad
officials
who
will
see
that
they
make
no
mistakes
i
can
not
possibly
afford
to
come
so
far
for
them
why
ca
evelyn
go
now
too
pleaded
lucy
as
she
and
evelyn
charlotte
and
celia
were
being
conveyed
on
a
rapid
run
home
by
frederic
forester
it
had
been
decided
necessary
for
all
feminine
hands
to
fall
to
work
to
accomplish
the
packing
in
time
to
get
the
young
people
off
at
nine
that
evening
evelyn
does
go
until
next
tuesday
and
this
is
only
thursday

answered
promptly
five
days
is
much
difference
urged
lucy
mournfully
and
when
evelyn
going
right
over
the
same
road
almost
to
our
home
i
should
think
she
like
to
go
when
we
do
if
it
did
cut
off
a
little
been
here
all
winter
so
have
you
lu
and
you
do
want
to
go
charlotte
reminded
her
she
did
not
say
that
nobody
could
bear
to
think
of
evelyn
departure
any
sooner
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
it
was
not
possible
honestly
to
say
the
same
about
lucy
but
when
they
reached
the
house
and
charlotte
had
run
up
to
her
room
to
exchange
her
dress
for
a
working
frock
evelyn
came
to
her
and
softly
closed
the
door
evelyn
had
persuaded
herself
that
she
ought
to
accompany
the
others
it
is
as
if
lucy
were
a
different
sort
of
girl
she
argued
against
her
own
wishes
for
she
longed
to
stay
more
than
she
dared
to
own
but
nobody
knows
how
she
might
behave
if
anybody
tried
to
get
to
know
her
somebody
she
ought
to
know
and
besides
she
afraid
it
really
does
matter
i
can
use
the
extra
time
getting
things
ready
for
thorne
please
do
urge
me
churchill
it
wo
be
a
bit
easier
next
week
gentle
as
she
was
charlotte
had
learned
that
when
evelyn
made
up
her
mind
that
she
ought
to
do
a
thing
it
was
as
good
as
done
so
presently
evelyn
too
was
packing
her
smiles
at
the
remonstrances
of
charlotte
and
celia
very
sweet
her
heart
very
heavy
well
dear
i
telephoned
the
others
at
banks
said
charlotte
coming
into
evelyn
room
having
just
left
lucy
in
an
ecstatic
condition
over
the
decision
you
should
have
heard
the
dismay
jeff
and
just
have
already
started
home
on
their
wheels
to
prevent
your
going
by
main
force
this
was
literally
true
from
doctor
forester
down
to
his
youngest
guest
had
come
regret
and
remonstrance
finally
however
doctor
forester
having
called
up
evelyn
herself
and
been
persuaded
that
she
was
sure
she
was
right
had
fallen
to
planning
what
could
be
done
to
make
the
girl
a
pleasant
one
for
her
to
remember
after
a
little
an
idea
seized
him
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
fell
to
telephoning
again
he
had
doctor
churchill
on
the
wire
then
charlotte
celia
and
his
son
frederic
who
had
remained
at
the
birches
finally
the
the
pullman
office
and
a
certain
official
of
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
ask
favours
and
get
them
granted
mrs
fields
said
evelyn
lee
coming
out
upon
the
back
porch
where
the
doctor
housekeeper
was
resting
after
a
busy
days
work
i
shall
never
forget
how
good
you
been
to
me
and
i
hope
you
forget
me
forget
you
ejaculated
fields
her
spare
strong
hand
grasping
tight
the
slender
one
held
out
to
her
well
there
ai
much
danger
of
that
nor
of
anybody
else
forgetting
you
i
been
about
as
pleased
as
the
doctor
and
miss
charlotte
to
see
you
pick
up
you
do
look
like
the
same
girl
that
came
here
last
fall
i
sure
i
do
feel
much
like
her
ever
so
much
of
it
is
certainly
due
to
your
good
cooking
mrs
fields
it
so
hard
to
take
leave
of
you
all
said
evelyn
on
the
porch
where
the
others
were
assembled
i
almost
like
to
slip
away
without
a
word
only
that
would
look
so
ungrateful
and
i
the
most
grateful
girl
alive
you
need
say
to
me
said
doctor
forester
for
i
going
as
far
as
washington
with
you
he
smiled
at
the
joy
which
flashed
into
her
face
oh
are
you
really
she
cried
you
need
say
to
me
either
said
frederic
forester
as
she
turned
to
him
standing
next
to
his
father
for
i
going
too
i
think
i
go
along
said
doctor
churchill
will
you
take
me
charlotte
was
smiling
at
evelyn
bewildered
face
if
charlotte
goes
i
shall
too
supplemented
celia
evelyn
looked
at
them
surely
enough
although
in
the
hurry
she
had
not
noticed
it
before
they
were
all
in
travelling
dress
she
had
known
they
had
meant
to
go
as
far
as
the
city
station
with
her
she
saw
now
that
they
were
fully
equipped
for
the
journey
and
washington
was
nearly
twenty
hours
away
you
dear
people
murmured
evelyn
and
rather
blindly
cast
herself
into
birch
outstretched
arms
there
was
only
one
thing
lacking
to
her
peace
of
mind
jeff
had
not
appeared
to
bid
her
charlotte
observed
that
evelyn
voice
trembled
a
little
when
she
said
where
jeff
will
you
tell
him
for
me
charlotte
answered
he
wo
fail
dear
he
surely
be
at
the
station
but
when
they
reached
the
station
no
jeff
was
there
nobody
seemed
to
notice
for
the
men
of
the
party
were
busy
looking
after
various
details
of
the
trip
celia
was
explaining
to
evelyn
and
lucy
how
it
had
all
come
about
doctor
forester
was
so
upset
and
sorry
over
your
going
she
said
that
he
went
to
thinking
up
excuses
to
go
along
he
remembered
an
important
medical
convention
in
washington
and
persuaded
andy
that
he
could
get
away
for
the
three
days
session
then
he
invited
charlotte
and
me
and
convinced
frederic
that
he
ought
to
go
too
we
were
only
too
willing
so
here
we
are
it
the
loveliest
thing
that
could
happen
said
evelyn
and
tried
hard
not
to
let
her
eyes
wander
to
the
doors
of
the
station
she
had
not
seen
jeff
since
early
in
the
afternoon
when
after
hot
argument
he
had
at
last
given
up
trying
to
persuade
her
that
she
need
not
go
until
the
coming
tuesday
to
just
only
however
as
he
carried
her
little
travelling
bag
on
board
the
train
for
her
did
she
say
a
word
please
tell
jeff
for
me
she
said
in
his
ear
as
he
established
her
in
the
designated
section
of
the
that
i
felt
very
badly
not
to
say
to
him
but
give
him
my
best
remembrance
and
say
that
i
sure
he
must
have
been
kept
from
coming
by
something
he
help
of
course
he
must
have
been
agreed
just
heartily
feeling
like
pitching
into
his
delinquent
brother
with
both
fists
for
bringing
that
hurt
little
look
into
the
hazel
eyes
below
him
he
probably
turn
up
just
as
your
train
gets
under
headway
and
then
he
be
the
maddest
fellow
you
ever
saw
hullo
i
bet
that
messenger
boy
is
looking
for
you
as
he
saw
frederic
forester
pointing
a
carrier
of
a
florist
box
toward
evelyn
he
went
forward
claimed
the
box
and
brought
it
back
to
evelyn
she
peeped
within
saw
a
great
cluster
of
roses
and
drew
out
a
card
of
course
it
jeff
queried
just
anxiously
and
he
felt
immense
relief
when
evelyn
nodded
well
i
off
just
gripped
her
hand
as
the
train
began
to
move
i
mighty
sorry
to
have
you
go
and
with
lifted
hat
and
a
hasty
farewell
to
lucy
and
randolph
he
was
gone
evelyn
smiled
at
him
from
the
window
as
he
ran
down
the
platform
waving
at
her
but
her
heart
was
still
heavy
it
was
very
good
of
jeff
to
send
the
flowers
but
she
would
rather
have
had
one
hearty
grasp
of
his
friendly
hand
than
all
the
roses
in
his
northern
state
chapter
x
well
i
consider
myself
pretty
lucky
to
have
secured
four
sections
all
together
on
this
train
said
doctor
forester
with
satisfaction
as
he
and
andrew
churchill
and
frederic
retired
to
the
while
their
berths
were
being
made
up
why
what
are
we
slowing
down
for
out
here
frederic
glanced
out
of
the
window
this
is
west
weston
is
it
yes
we
off
again
some
official
probably
a
door
slammed
and
a
tall
figure
hurried
through
the
passage
looked
in
at
the
and
turned
back
hullo
said
a
familiar
voice
and
jeff
laughing
face
beamed
in
upon
them
well
well
did
you
hold
up
the
train
they
cried
thought
you
come
along
too
did
you
asked
doctor
forester
good
glad
to
have
you
i
thought
it
was
odd
you
were
round
to
see
us
off
go
and
surprise
the
girls
they
just
back
there
waiting
for
their
berths
jeff
hurried
eagerly
away
a
moment
later
evelyn
standing
in
the
aisle
beside
charlotte
felt
a
touch
on
her
arm
she
looked
up
and
met
eyes
smiling
down
at
her
did
you
think
i
let
you
go
like
that
he
said
in
her
ear
i
afraid
i
thought
you
had
she
admitted
grown
happy
in
an
instant
you
see
i
had
an
appointment
with
a
man
in
west
weston
on
some
work
i
been
doing
for
him
after
i
heard
this
plan
of
doctor
forester
i
had
only
just
time
to
catch
a
train
and
get
out
there
he
kept
me
so
long
i
missed
the
train
that
would
have
brought
me
back
in
time
to
see
you
off
so
i
telephoned
chester
agnew
to
get
the
flowers
for
me
and
write
a
card
that
was
when
i
was
afraid
i
might
not
make
connections
at
all
but
when
this
man
i
went
to
see
he
a
railroad
man
heard
what
train
i
wanted
to
make
he
offered
to
stop
it
for
me
then
it
just
came
into
my
mind
that
i
join
the
party
even
without
an
invitation
tell
me
you
not
sorry
wo
you
of
course
i
not
she
allowed
him
one
of
her
frank
looks
and
he
smiled
back
at
her
we
have
a
great
day
he
prophesied
they
put
on
a
pullman
with
an
observation
rear
in
the
morning
and
if
the
weather
holds
we
camp
out
there
for
the
day
we
do
get
into
washington
till
three
in
the
afternoon
and
the
scenery
all
the
way
down
will
be
fine
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
off
now
and
let
you
be
tucked
up
please
get
up
bright
and
early
in
the
morning
will
you
it
was
a
merry
party
which
entered
the
the
next
morning
the
moment
the
first
summons
came
the
day
had
risen
bright
and
clear
as
a
june
day
could
be
and
everybody
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
on
the
observation
platform
doctor
forester
sitting
opposite
charlotte
and
andy
at
one
table
glanced
across
at
the
rest
of
the
party
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
and
said
in
a
low
voice
this
is
literally
a
case
of
speeding
the
parting
guest
is
it
captain
john
rayburn
got
you
into
something
of
a
scrape
when
he
sent
you
that
copper
inscription
over
your
fireplace
did
he
he
realise
that
the
it
brought
you
in
november
would
have
to
be
conveyed
away
by
force
in
june
it
was
the
only
way
to
give
you
an
interval
when
you
should
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
your
married
life
have
no
guests
at
all
charlotte
and
andrew
were
staring
at
him
in
amazement
uncle
ray
cried
charlotte
under
her
breath
was
he
the
one
did
you
know
it
all
the
time
doctor
forester
yes
i
knew
it
all
the
time
he
owned
in
fact
captain
rayburn
wrote
to
me
after
he
had
heard
of
the
fireplace
you
sent
him
a
photograph
of
it
did
you
so
we
did
doctor
churchill
answered
we
took
it
the
day
the
fireplace
was
finished
i
forgotten
it
completely
but
i
remember
now
we
thought
he
be
interested
because
something
he
once
said
about
the
ideal
fireplace
had
put
the
idea
into
our
heads
of
collecting
the
stones
ourselves
so
he
wrote
all
the
way
from
denmark
to
have
that
made
he
had
it
made
there
and
wrote
me
for
the
measurements
he
expressed
it
to
me
and
i
repacked
it
and
sent
it
to
you
chuckled
doctor
forester
he
was
determined
to
puzzle
you
completely
he
certainly
succeeded
did
he
give
you
leave
to
tell
at
this
particular
date
it
was
left
to
my
discretion
after
the
first
six
months
provided
you
had
had
any
guests
i
thought
the
time
was
ripe
and
you
earned
your
diploma
all
that
worries
me
is
that
you
may
find
a
fresh
instalment
of
ornaments
when
you
get
back
the
motto
strikes
me
as
a
sort
of
uncanny
provider
of
them
the
others
laughed
charlotte
glanced
across
at
evelyn
it
has
paid
she
said
softly
andy
nodded
it
certainly
has
all
the
thanks
we
shall
need
will
be
in
thorne
lee
letter
after
he
has
seen
his
little
sister
i
rather
think
it
paid
with
the
others
too
doctor
forester
added
anyhow
you
certainly
done
your
part
out
on
the
back
of
the
train
charlotte
found
lucy
at
her
elbow
she
looked
into
the
girl
face
and
discovered
the
blue
eyes
to
be
full
of
tears
why
lu
dear
she
said
softly
churchill
lucy
was
almost
crying
i
just
ca
bear
to
think
it
the
last
day
i
wish
oh
i
wish
i
lived
with
you
do
you
dear
that
very
pleasant
and
charlotte
drew
her
close
feeling
more
warmth
toward
lucy
than
the
girl
had
yet
inspired
but
do
be
blue
i
ca
help
it
it
almost
ten
now
and
at
three
we
shall
be
going
away
from
you
all
no
you
wo
charlotte
whispered
in
her
ear
it
was
to
have
been
a
surprise
but
i
think
you
enjoy
it
more
to
know
only
do
tell
evelyn
doctor
forester
has
telegraphed
your
mother
and
received
her
answer
you
not
to
go
till
night
at
six
and
we
to
have
hours
together
in
washington
oh
lucy
almost
screamed
so
that
the
others
looked
around
at
her
and
smiled
oh
i
do
think
doctor
forester
and
you
are
just
the
nicest
people
i
ever
knew
doctor
forester
secret
was
not
very
well
kept
after
all
lucy
whispered
the
good
news
to
jeff
and
he
could
not
forbear
telling
it
to
evelyn
just
as
the
train
was
drawing
out
of
baltimore
his
own
spirits
had
been
drooping
as
time
went
on
but
the
reprieve
of
a
day
sent
them
up
with
a
bound
the
question
is
what
we
shall
do
with
our
time
said
doctor
forester
looking
round
at
his
party
in
the
hotel
parlour
where
he
had
taken
them
speak
up
everybody
we
can
divide
our
forces
if
necessary
is
there
anybody
here
who
has
been
here
before
lucy
and
randolph
seemed
to
be
the
only
ones
not
more
or
less
familiar
with
the
capital
on
hearing
this
doctor
forester
declared
that
he
should
himself
take
them
to
as
many
of
the
most
interesting
places
as
possible
whatever
we
do
i
vote
for
the
trip
down
the
potomac
to
mount
vernon
in
the
morning
said
doctor
churchill
promptly
we
get
back
in
plenty
of
time
for
evelyn
train
and
there
certainly
is
a
better
way
to
put
in
the
time
than
that
this
was
heartily
agreed
upon
and
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
used
in
various
ways
not
more
than
two
of
which
it
may
be
remarked
were
alike
charlotte
smiled
meaningly
at
her
husband
as
she
watched
celia
and
fred
forester
having
proceeded
across
lafayette
park
with
jeff
and
evelyn
leave
the
two
at
a
and
walk
briskly
off
by
themselves
that
certainly
a
sure
thing
is
it
said
he
no
question
of
it
i
think
are
you
satisfied
perfectly
i
have
seen
very
much
of
fred
since
he
and
we
grew
up
but
if
he
his
father
son
he
is
i
think
said
doctor
churchill
confidently
and
the
doctor
likes
it
i
sure
there
satisfaction
in
his
face
whenever
he
looks
at
them
in
fact
i
ca
help
thinking
he
planned
both
the
house
party
and
this
trip
with
a
view
of
bringing
them
together
all
he
could
dear
celia
if
she
just
half
as
happy
as
she
deserves
to
be
she
will
be
she
loves
to
travel
has
had
half
enough
of
it
and
he
take
her
round
the
world
i
have
had
a
chance
to
tell
you
that
he
going
to
india
in
the
fall
in
some
important
capacity
he
received
the
appointment
just
yesterday
really
charlotte
looked
thoughtful
celia
in
india
andy
does
that
startle
you
i
do
imagine
it
for
any
long
stay
but
as
a
matter
of
some
scientific
investigations
here
do
go
to
looking
sober
i
shall
be
sorry
i
told
you
charlotte
smiled
and
answered
brightly
that
it
was
not
a
thing
to
look
sober
over
nevertheless
her
thoughts
were
much
with
her
sister
the
next
morning
as
the
party
found
their
places
on
the
little
steamer
which
was
to
take
them
down
the
river
to
mount
vernon
she
found
herself
watching
celia
more
closely
than
she
had
meant
to
do
in
the
anxiety
to
discover
if
the
trip
to
india
was
really
imminent
is
mount
vernon
a
fascinating
spot
asked
evelyn
as
she
and
jeff
walked
up
the
long
ascending
road
from
pier
to
house
together
never
forgotten
my
first
visit
i
lived
in
washington
times
in
my
dreams
for
weeks
afterward
i
never
saw
it
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
garden
must
be
in
its
prime
now
let
go
and
see
it
first
responded
jeff
quickly
i
do
remember
much
about
it
my
two
visits
here
have
all
been
spent
in
the
house
so
while
the
others
rambled
through
the
quaint
and
interesting
rooms
jeff
and
evelyn
made
their
way
to
the
paths
of
lady
washington
garden
and
wandered
about
there
in
the
warm
june
sunshine
it
grew
so
hot
after
a
while
that
they
betook
themselves
to
the
lawn
and
banks
overlooking
the
river
and
sat
there
talking
as
they
watched
the
waters
of
the
potomac
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
get
home
asked
jeff
somewhat
suddenly
put
our
rooms
in
order
evelyn
responded
promptly
all
by
yourself
we
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
lovely
little
woman
the
wife
of
a
former
confederate
general
i
shall
be
with
her
until
thorne
comes
i
suppose
you
lots
of
friends
of
your
own
age
jeff
observed
not
as
many
as
i
ought
to
have
you
see
i
lived
very
quietly
with
my
brother
for
six
years
now
except
for
the
time
i
spent
at
a
school
in
baltimore
since
i
came
home
from
there
i
not
been
very
strong
and
thorne
has
kept
me
very
quiet
until
he
sent
me
north
to
school
last
fall
you
so
well
now
you
be
going
about
a
lot
any
young
people
in
the
house
with
you
it
a
is
it
yes
a
small
one
there
are
no
young
people
in
it
except
livingstone
son
how
old
a
fellow
i
believe
i
suppose
you
great
friends
with
him
said
jeff
suspiciously
evelyn
looked
at
him
quickly
and
laughed
flushing
a
little
why
naturally
very
good
friends
she
said
evelyn
said
jeff
sitting
up
straight
again
i
absolutely
bursting
to
tell
you
some
news
and
i
ca
seem
to
lead
up
to
it
i
got
to
bring
it
out
flat
the
only
thing
i
anxious
about
is
whether
going
to
be
as
good
news
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
she
looked
at
him
with
a
quickening
of
her
pulses
his
expression
had
become
so
very
eager
please
do
keep
me
in
suspense
she
begged
well
jeff
did
his
best
to
speak
coolly
as
if
the
matter
were
really
of
no
great
importance
after
all
you
know
it
been
a
question
with
me
all
along
as
to
just
what
i
was
going
to
do
when
i
got
out
of
college
i
wanted
tremendously
to
get
to
work
and
a
lot
of
the
usual
things
did
seem
to
appeal
to
me
at
all
i
have
enough
of
a
scientific
turn
to
go
into
any
of
the
engineering
courses
i
did
care
for
a
mercantile
berth
in
fact
while
my
brother
lanse
has
had
his
future
cut
out
for
him
since
he
was
fourteen
and
just
at
sixteen
is
body
and
soul
in
for
electrical
engineering
i
been
the
family
problem
father
had
the
sense
not
to
assert
his
wishes
for
a
moment
he
saw
from
the
start
i
suppose
that
the
family
traditions
were
not
for
me
i
could
never
begin
by
studying
law
and
end
by
wearing
the
ermine
as
a
lot
of
my
grandfathers
and
uncles
have
done
so
jeff
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
he
had
been
looking
off
down
the
river
as
he
talked
but
now
he
brought
his
eyes
back
to
evelyn
face
and
his
spirits
leaped
exultantly
as
he
saw
with
what
eager
attention
she
was
listening
you
really
care
to
hear
all
this
do
you
he
asked
happily
and
went
on
before
she
could
do
more
than
nod
well
the
short
of
it
is
that
through
doctor
forester
i
got
to
know
a
friend
of
his
who
is
a
railroad
magnate
the
real
thing
and
to
please
the
doctor
he
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
me
he
offered
me
a
position
in
one
of
his
offices
provided
i
take
a
year
to
study
practical
railroading
first
of
course
i
only
too
glad
to
do
that
and
now
i
coming
to
the
point
of
the
whole
thing
when
my
year
is
up
that
office
where
i
to
begin
to
work
up
in
the
railroad
business
is
he
paused
dramatically
watching
his
hearer
face
as
his
own
in
spite
of
himself
broke
into
a
smile
in
your
own
city
evelyn
lee
if
he
had
had
any
lingering
doubt
that
this
might
not
be
as
good
news
to
evelyn
as
he
wanted
it
to
be
his
fears
were
put
to
rout
o
jeff
she
said
quite
breathlessly
and
the
happy
colour
surged
into
her
face
why
that
almost
too
good
to
be
true
is
it
you
a
trump
for
saying
so
jupiter
i
feel
like
standing
up
and
shouting
the
thing
has
been
sure
since
that
afternoon
i
went
to
weston
but
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
of
it
in
this
crazy
boy
fashion
but
write
it
to
you
quite
calmly
after
you
got
home
but
it
keep
i
should
think
it
would
besides
it
so
much
nicer
to
hear
it
now
when
it
makes
it
she
stopped
abruptly
and
jumped
up
jeff
leaped
to
his
feet
also
makes
it
what
he
asked
eagerly
why
it
such
a
pleasant
place
to
hear
good
news
in
that
was
what
you
were
going
to
say
we
ought
to
go
back
to
the
house
she
began
to
move
slowly
away
jeff
followed
i
like
to
hear
the
end
of
that
sentence
he
urged
as
they
walked
up
the
grassy
slope
to
the
house
in
the
clear
sunlight
she
laughed
a
little
but
shook
her
head
she
was
looking
very
sweet
in
her
brown
travelling
dress
her
russet
hair
shaded
by
a
wide
brown
hat
with
captivating
curving
outlines
jeff
looked
at
her
dainty
profile
and
realised
that
the
hour
for
separation
was
coming
fast
anyhow
i
know
what
i
you
were
going
to
say
he
was
striding
close
by
her
side
and
i
can
certainly
say
it
if
you
ca
telling
you
that
i
coming
to
work
near
you
next
year
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
say
now
and
that
well
that
going
to
be
a
bit
tough
evelyn
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
silence
then
she
turned
and
spoke
softly
over
her
shoulder
there
was
not
a
touch
of
coquetry
in
her
simple
manner
yet
it
had
an
engaging
quality
all
its
own
that
what
i
wanted
to
say
jeff
thank
you
he
responded
i
not
forget
that
and
his
tone
told
that
he
appreciated
the
little
concession
it
seemed
but
the
briefest
possible
space
of
time
before
they
had
gone
over
the
house
had
been
hurried
back
to
the
landing
by
emphatic
toots
from
the
small
excursion
steamer
and
were
off
for
the
city
again
the
trip
back
up
the
river
was
finished
also
before
it
seemed
hardly
begun
all
too
soon
for
anybody
the
three
young
travellers
were
on
their
train
and
doctor
churchill
and
fred
forester
had
taken
leave
of
them
and
were
out
on
the
platform
ready
to
jump
off
jeff
had
lingered
till
the
last
lucy
ran
he
said
and
gave
each
a
hearty
grip
and
smile
then
his
hand
clasped
evelyn
his
eyes
said
things
his
lips
would
not
have
ventured
to
speak
and
his
hand
wrung
hers
with
a
fervour
which
made
it
sting
then
he
went
away
without
a
backward
look
as
if
he
must
get
the
parting
quickly
over
outside
the
train
however
he
turned
with
the
others
and
as
the
train
rolled
slowly
out
of
the
station
and
evelyn
strained
her
eyes
to
see
the
group
of
her
friends
waving
affectionately
to
her
from
the
platform
the
last
face
upon
which
her
gaze
rested
wore
the
strong
loyal
eloquent
look
of
jefferson
birch
home
again
said
andrew
churchill
as
he
set
his
in
the
door
of
the
brick
house
four
days
later
fieldsy
must
be
away
or
she
would
have
answered
they
hurried
through
the
house
it
was
in
absolute
order
but
empty
on
the
office
desk
was
a
note
in
the
housekeeper
awkward
hand
if
you
should
come
i
had
to
go
to
take
care
of
a
sick
woman
will
be
back
in
the
morning
you
will
find
everything
cooked
up
doctor
churchill
read
it
with
a
laugh
charlotte
we
actually
alone
in
our
own
house
let
run
over
to
the
other
house
and
embrace
them
all
round
and
then
come
back
and
see
how
it
feels
over
here
so
they
went
across
the
lawn
we
shall
be
delighted
to
have
you
stay
with
us
my
dears
said
birch
after
the
greetings
mother
birch
said
her
with
air
affectionate
hand
on
her
shoulder
not
even
you
can
charm
us
out
of
our
own
house
do
you
know
that
we
all
alone
that
not
even
fieldsy
is
over
there
charlotte
going
to
get
dinner
and
i
to
help
her
with
the
clearing
up
and
then
we
going
to
sit
on
our
porch
of
course
we
shall
be
constantly
looking
down
the
street
for
a
messenger
boy
with
a
telegram
announcing
the
coming
of
our
next
guest
but
until
he
comes
everybody
laughed
at
the
expressive
breath
he
drew
go
you
dear
children
said
birch
and
the
rest
joined
in
warmly
i
sit
on
our
doorstone
with
a
rifle
and
pick
off
the
visitors
as
they
come
up
the
street
cried
just
as
the
two
went
off
do
shoot
to
kill
doctor
churchill
called
back
gaily
then
the
door
closed
on
the
pair
when
the
happy
little
dinner
was
over
the
dishes
put
away
and
charlotte
had
slipped
on
a
cool
frock
in
which
to
spend
the
warm
summer
evening
she
went
out
to
find
her
husband
lying
comfortably
in
the
hammock
behind
the
vines
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
the
twilight
was
just
slipping
into
evening
and
the
breath
of
unseen
roses
was
sweet
upon
the
shadows
charlotte
drew
a
chair
close
to
her
husband
side
and
sat
down
after
all
andy
said
she
as
they
fell
to
talking
of
the
past
year
i
would
have
had
it
different
one
thing
is
certain
out
of
our
three
guests
we
entertained
at
least
one
angel
unawares
yes
and
i
like
to
think
that
perhaps
the
others
are
none
the
worse
for
staying
with
us
andrew
churchill
answered
thoughtfully
i
glad
we
did
it
glad
it
over
and
shall
be
glad
to
have
other
people
come
to
see
us
by
and
by
but
i
want
a
good
long
honeymoon
first
is
that
your
mind
yes
she
answered
fervently
smiling
