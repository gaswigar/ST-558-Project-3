my
the
house
of
the
vampire
i
the
freakish
little
leader
of
the
orchestra
newly
imported
from
sicily
to
new
york
tossed
his
conductor
wand
excitedly
through
the
air
drowning
with
musical
thunders
the
hum
of
conversation
and
the
clatter
of
plates
yet
neither
his
apish
demeanour
nor
the
deafening
noises
that
responded
to
every
movement
of
his
agile
body
detracted
attention
from
the
figure
of
reginald
clarke
and
the
young
man
at
his
side
as
they
smilingly
wound
their
way
to
the
exit
the
boy
expression
was
pleasant
with
an
inkling
of
wistfulness
while
the
soft
glimmer
of
his
lucid
eyes
betrayed
the
poet
and
the
dreamer
the
smile
of
reginald
clarke
was
the
smile
of
a
conqueror
a
suspicion
of
silver
in
his
crown
of
dark
hair
only
added
dignity
to
his
bearing
while
the
infinitely
ramified
lines
above
the
mouth
spoke
at
once
of
subtlety
and
of
strength
without
stretch
of
the
imagination
one
might
have
likened
him
to
a
roman
cardinal
of
the
days
of
the
borgias
who
had
miraculously
stepped
forth
from
the
canvas
and
slipped
into
twentieth
century
with
the
affability
of
complete
he
nodded
in
response
to
greetings
from
all
sides
inclining
his
head
with
special
politeness
to
a
young
woman
whose
eyes
were
riveted
upon
his
features
with
a
look
of
mingled
hate
and
admiration
the
woman
disregarding
his
silent
salutation
continued
to
stare
at
him
as
a
damned
soul
in
purgatory
might
look
at
satan
passing
in
regal
splendour
through
the
seventy
times
sevenfold
circles
of
hell
reginald
clarke
walked
on
unconcernedly
through
the
rows
of
gay
diners
still
smiling
affable
calm
but
his
companion
bethought
himself
of
certain
rumours
he
had
heard
concerning
ethel
brandenbourg
mad
love
for
the
man
from
whose
features
she
could
not
even
now
turn
her
eyes
evidently
her
passion
was
unreciprocated
it
had
not
always
been
so
there
was
a
time
in
her
career
some
years
ago
in
paris
when
it
was
whispered
that
she
had
secretly
married
him
and
not
much
later
obtained
a
divorce
the
matter
was
never
cleared
up
as
both
preserved
an
uncompromising
silence
upon
the
subject
of
their
matrimonial
experience
certain
it
was
that
for
a
space
the
genius
of
reginald
clarke
had
completely
dominated
her
brush
and
that
ever
since
he
had
thrown
her
aside
her
pictures
were
but
plagiarisms
of
her
former
artistic
self
the
cause
of
the
rupture
between
them
was
a
matter
only
of
surmise
but
the
effect
it
had
on
the
woman
testified
clearly
to
the
remarkable
power
of
reginald
clarke
he
had
entered
her
life
and
behold
the
world
was
transfixed
on
her
canvases
in
myriad
hues
of
transcending
radiance
he
had
passed
from
it
and
with
him
vanished
the
brilliancy
of
her
colouring
as
at
sunset
the
borrowed
amber
and
gold
fade
from
the
face
of
the
clouds
the
glamour
of
clarke
name
may
have
partly
explained
the
secret
of
his
charm
but
even
in
circles
where
literary
fame
is
no
passport
he
could
if
he
chose
exercise
an
almost
terrible
fascination
subtle
and
profound
he
had
ransacked
the
coffers
of
mediæval
dialecticians
and
plundered
the
arsenals
of
the
sophists
many
years
later
when
the
vultures
of
misfortune
had
swooped
down
upon
him
and
his
name
was
no
longer
mentioned
without
a
sneer
he
was
still
remembered
in
new
york
as
the
man
who
had
brought
to
perfection
the
art
of
talking
even
to
dine
with
him
was
a
liberal
education
clarke
marvellous
conversational
power
was
equalled
only
by
his
marvellous
style
ernest
fielding
heart
leaped
in
him
at
the
thought
that
henceforth
he
would
be
privileged
to
live
under
one
roof
with
the
only
writer
of
his
generation
who
could
lend
to
the
english
language
the
rich
strength
and
rugged
music
of
the
elizabethans
reginald
clarke
was
a
master
of
many
instruments
milton
mighty
organ
was
no
less
obedient
to
his
touch
than
the
little
lute
of
the
troubadour
he
was
never
the
same
that
was
his
strength
style
possessed
at
once
the
chiselled
chasteness
of
a
greek
marble
column
and
the
elaborate
deviltry
of
the
late
renaissance
at
times
his
winged
words
seemed
to
flutter
down
the
page
frantically
like
baroque
angels
at
other
times
nothing
could
have
more
adequately
described
his
manner
than
the
timeless
calm
of
the
gaunt
pyramids
the
two
men
had
reached
the
street
reginald
wrapped
his
long
spring
coat
round
him
i
shall
expect
you
at
four
he
said
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
deep
and
melodious
suggesting
hidden
depths
and
cadences
i
shall
be
punctual
the
younger
man
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
i
look
forward
to
your
coming
with
much
pleasure
i
am
interested
in
you
the
glad
blood
mounted
to
ernest
cheeks
at
praise
from
the
austere
lips
of
this
arbiter
of
literary
elegance
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
crept
over
the
other
man
features
i
am
proud
that
my
work
interests
you
was
all
the
boy
could
say
i
think
it
is
quite
amazing
but
at
present
here
clarke
drew
out
a
watch
set
with
jewels
i
am
afraid
i
must
bid
you
he
held
ernest
hand
for
a
moment
in
a
firm
genial
grasp
then
turned
away
briskly
while
the
boy
remained
standing
the
crowd
jostling
against
him
carried
him
almost
off
his
feet
but
his
eyes
followed
far
into
the
night
the
masterful
figure
of
reginald
clarke
toward
whom
he
felt
himself
drawn
with
every
fiber
of
his
body
and
the
warm
enthusiasm
of
his
generous
youth
ii
with
elastic
step
inhaling
the
with
voluptuous
delight
reginald
clarke
made
his
way
down
broadway
lying
stretched
out
before
him
bathed
in
light
and
pulsating
with
life
his
intellect
was
powerfully
attracted
by
the
giant
city
motley
activities
on
the
street
as
in
the
salon
his
magnetic
power
compelled
recognition
and
he
stepped
through
the
midst
of
the
crowd
as
a
circassian
blade
cleaves
water
after
walking
a
block
or
two
he
suddenly
halted
before
a
shop
arrayed
in
the
window
were
priceless
gems
that
shone
in
the
glare
of
electricity
like
mystical
green
pomegranate
and
and
as
he
stood
there
the
dazzling
radiance
before
him
was
transformed
in
the
prism
of
his
mind
into
something
great
and
very
wonderful
that
might
some
day
be
a
poem
then
his
attention
was
diverted
by
a
small
group
of
tiny
girls
dancing
on
the
sidewalk
to
the
husky
strains
of
an
old
he
joined
the
circle
of
amused
spectators
to
watch
those
bits
of
femininity
swaying
airily
to
and
fro
in
unison
with
the
tune
one
especially
attracted
his
notice
a
slim
girl
from
a
land
where
it
is
always
spring
her
whole
being
translated
into
music
with
hair
dishevelled
and
feet
hardly
touching
the
ground
the
girl
suggested
an
dancing
on
a
sunbeam
the
rasping
perchance
brought
to
her
melodious
reminiscences
of
some
savoyard
boy
and
dark
of
hair
for
several
minutes
reginald
clarke
followed
with
keen
delight
each
delicate
curve
her
graceful
limbs
described
then
was
it
that
she
grew
tired
or
that
the
stranger
persistent
scrutiny
embarrassed
her
the
music
oozed
out
of
her
movements
they
grew
slower
angular
almost
clumsy
the
look
of
interest
in
clarke
eyes
died
but
his
whole
form
quivered
as
if
the
rhythm
of
the
music
and
the
dance
had
mysteriously
entered
into
his
blood
he
continued
his
stroll
seemingly
without
aim
in
reality
he
followed
with
nervous
intensity
the
multiform
undulations
of
the
populace
swarming
through
broadway
in
either
direction
like
the
giant
whose
strength
was
rekindled
every
time
he
touched
his
mother
the
earth
reginald
clarke
seemed
to
draw
fresh
vitality
from
every
contact
with
life
he
turned
east
along
fourteenth
street
where
cheap
vaudevilles
are
strung
together
as
on
the
throat
of
a
wanton
gaudy
drenched
in
clamorous
red
proclaimed
the
tawdry
attractions
within
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
doorkeeper
at
a
particularly
music
hall
reginald
clarke
lingered
in
the
lobby
and
finally
even
bought
a
ticket
that
entitled
him
to
enter
this
sordid
wilderness
of
décolleté
art
a
few
workingmen
dilapidated
sportsmen
and
women
whose
ruined
youth
thick
layers
of
powder
and
paint
even
in
this
artificial
light
could
not
restore
constituted
the
bulk
of
the
audience
reginald
clarke
apparently
unconscious
of
the
curiosity
surprise
and
envy
that
his
appearance
excited
seated
himself
at
a
table
near
the
stage
ordering
from
the
solicitous
waiter
only
a
cocktail
and
a
programme
the
drink
he
left
untouched
while
his
eyes
greedily
ran
down
the
lines
of
the
announcement
when
he
had
found
what
he
sought
he
lit
a
cigar
paying
no
attention
to
the
boards
but
studying
the
audience
with
cursory
interest
until
the
appearance
of
betsy
the
hyacinth
girl
when
she
began
to
sing
his
mind
still
wandered
the
words
of
her
song
were
crude
but
not
without
a
certain
lilt
that
delighted
the
uncultured
ear
while
the
girl
voice
was
thin
to
the
point
of
being
unpleasant
when
however
she
came
to
the
burden
of
the
song
clarke
manner
changed
suddenly
laying
down
his
cigar
he
listened
with
rapt
attention
eagerly
gazing
at
her
for
as
she
sang
the
last
line
and
tore
the
from
her
hair
there
crept
into
her
voice
a
strangely
poignant
pathetic
little
thrill
that
redeemed
the
execrable
faultiness
of
her
singing
and
brought
the
rude
audience
under
her
spell
clarke
too
was
captivated
by
that
tremour
the
infinite
sadness
of
which
suggested
the
plaint
of
souls
moaning
low
at
night
when
lust
preys
on
creatures
marked
for
its
spoil
the
singer
paused
still
those
luminous
eyes
were
upon
her
she
grew
nervous
it
was
only
with
tremendous
difficulty
that
she
reached
the
refrain
as
she
sang
the
opening
lines
of
the
last
stanza
an
inscrutable
smile
curled
on
clarke
lips
she
noticed
the
relentless
gaze
and
faltered
when
the
burden
came
her
singing
was
hard
and
cracked
the
tremour
had
gone
from
her
voice
iii
long
before
the
appointed
time
ernest
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
abode
of
reginald
clarke
a
stately
overlooking
riverside
drive
misshapen
automobiles
were
chasing
by
carrying
to
the
cool
marge
the
restlessness
and
the
fever
of
american
life
but
the
bustle
and
the
noise
seemed
to
the
boy
only
auspicious
omens
of
the
future
jack
his
and
dearest
friend
had
left
him
a
month
ago
and
for
a
space
he
had
felt
very
lonely
his
young
and
delicate
soul
found
it
difficult
to
grapple
with
the
vague
fears
that
his
nervous
brain
engendered
when
whispered
sounds
seemed
to
float
from
hidden
corners
and
the
stairs
creaked
under
mysterious
feet
he
needed
the
voice
of
loving
kindness
to
call
him
back
from
the
valley
of
haunting
shadows
where
his
poet
soul
was
wont
to
linger
overlong
in
his
hours
of
weakness
the
light
caress
of
a
comrade
renewed
his
strength
and
rekindled
in
his
hand
the
flaming
sword
of
song
and
at
nightfall
he
would
bring
the
day
harvest
to
clarke
as
a
worshipper
scattering
precious
stones
incense
and
tapestries
at
the
feet
of
a
god
surely
he
would
be
very
happy
and
as
the
heart
at
times
leads
the
feet
to
the
goal
of
its
desire
while
multicoloured
dreams
like
lull
the
will
to
sleep
he
suddenly
found
himself
stepping
from
the
to
reginald
clarke
apartment
already
was
he
raising
his
hand
to
strike
the
electric
bell
when
a
sound
from
within
made
him
pause
no
there
no
help
he
heard
clarke
say
his
voice
had
a
hard
metallic
clangour
a
boyish
voice
answered
plaintively
what
the
words
were
ernest
could
not
distinctly
hear
but
the
suppressed
sob
in
them
almost
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
he
instinctively
knew
that
this
was
the
finale
of
some
tragedy
he
withdrew
hastily
so
as
not
to
be
a
witness
of
an
interview
that
was
not
meant
for
his
ears
reginald
clarke
probably
had
good
reason
for
parting
with
his
young
friend
whom
ernest
surmised
to
be
abel
felton
a
talented
boy
whom
the
master
had
taken
under
his
wings
in
the
apartment
a
momentary
silence
had
ensued
this
was
interrupted
by
clarke
it
will
come
again
in
a
month
in
a
year
in
two
years
no
no
it
is
all
gone
sobbed
the
boy
nonsense
you
are
merely
nervous
but
that
is
just
why
we
must
part
there
is
no
room
in
one
house
for
two
nervous
people
i
was
not
such
a
nervous
wreck
before
i
met
you
am
i
to
blame
for
it
for
your
morbid
fancies
your
extravagance
the
slow
tread
of
a
nervous
disease
perhaps
who
can
tell
but
i
am
all
confused
i
do
know
what
i
am
saying
everything
is
so
puzzling
life
friendship
you
i
fancied
you
cared
for
my
career
and
now
you
end
our
friendship
without
a
thought
we
must
all
follow
the
law
of
our
being
the
laws
are
within
us
and
in
our
control
they
are
within
us
and
beyond
us
it
is
the
physiological
structure
of
our
brains
our
that
makes
and
mars
our
lives
our
mental
companionship
was
so
beautiful
it
was
meant
to
last
that
is
the
dream
of
youth
nothing
lasts
everything
flows
panta
rei
we
are
all
but
sojourners
in
an
inn
friendship
as
love
is
an
illusion
life
has
nothing
to
take
from
a
man
who
has
no
illusions
it
has
nothing
to
give
him
they
said
at
the
door
ernest
met
abel
where
are
you
going
he
asked
for
a
little
pleasure
trip
ernest
knew
that
the
boy
lied
he
remembered
that
abel
felton
was
at
work
upon
some
book
a
play
or
a
novel
it
occurred
to
him
to
inquire
how
far
he
had
progressed
with
it
abel
smiled
sadly
i
am
not
writing
it
not
writing
it
reginald
is
i
am
afraid
i
do
understand
never
mind
some
day
you
will
iv
i
am
so
happy
you
came
reginald
clarke
said
as
he
conducted
ernest
into
his
studio
it
was
a
large
luxuriously
furnished
room
overlooking
the
hudson
and
riverside
drive
dazzled
and
bewildered
the
boy
eyes
wandered
from
object
to
object
from
picture
to
statue
despite
seemingly
incongruous
details
the
whole
arrangement
possessed
style
and
distinction
a
satyr
on
the
mantelpiece
whispered
obscene
secrets
into
the
ears
of
saint
cecilia
the
argent
limbs
of
antinous
brushed
against
the
garments
of
mona
lisa
and
from
a
corner
a
little
rococo
lady
peered
coquettishly
at
the
gray
image
of
an
egyptian
sphinx
there
was
a
picture
of
napoleon
facing
the
image
of
the
crucified
above
all
in
the
artificially
produced
by
heavy
draperies
towered
two
busts
shakespeare
and
balzac
ernest
exclaimed
with
some
surprise
yes
explained
reginald
they
are
my
gods
his
gods
surely
there
was
a
key
to
clarke
character
our
gods
are
ourselves
raised
to
the
highest
power
clarke
and
shakespeare
even
to
ernest
admiring
mind
it
seemed
almost
blasphemous
to
name
a
contemporary
however
esteemed
in
one
breath
with
the
mighty
master
of
song
whose
great
gaunt
shadow
thrown
against
the
background
of
the
years
has
assumed
immense
unproportionate
monstrous
dimensions
yet
something
might
be
said
for
the
comparison
clarke
undoubtedly
was
universally
broad
and
undoubtedly
concealed
with
no
less
exquisite
taste
than
the
elizabethan
his
own
personality
under
the
splendid
raiment
of
his
art
they
certainly
were
affinities
it
would
not
have
been
surprising
to
him
to
see
the
clear
calm
head
of
shakespeare
rise
from
behind
his
host
perhaps
who
knows
the
very
presence
of
the
bust
in
his
room
had
to
some
extent
subtly
and
secretly
moulded
reginald
clarke
life
a
soul
like
the
chameleon
takes
colour
from
its
environment
even
comparative
trifles
the
number
of
the
house
in
which
we
live
or
the
colour
of
the
wallpaper
of
a
room
may
determine
a
destiny
the
boy
eyes
were
again
surveying
the
fantastic
surroundings
in
which
he
found
himself
while
from
a
corner
clarke
eyes
were
watching
his
every
movement
as
if
to
follow
his
thoughts
into
the
innermost
labyrinth
of
the
mind
it
seemed
to
ernest
under
the
spell
of
this
passing
fancy
as
though
each
vase
each
picture
each
curio
in
the
room
was
reflected
in
clarke
work
in
a
porcelain
chinese
mandarin
he
distinctly
recognised
a
quaint
quatrain
in
one
of
clarke
most
marvellous
poems
and
he
could
have
sworn
that
the
grin
of
the
hindu
on
the
reappeared
in
the
weird
rhythm
of
two
stanzas
whose
grotesque
cadence
had
haunted
him
for
years
at
last
clarke
broke
the
silence
you
like
my
studio
he
asked
the
simple
question
brought
ernest
back
to
reality
like
it
why
it
stunning
it
set
up
in
me
the
queerest
train
of
thought
i
too
have
been
in
a
whimsical
mood
fancy
unlike
genius
is
an
infectious
disease
what
is
the
peculiar
form
it
assumed
in
your
case
i
have
been
wondering
whether
all
the
things
that
environ
us
day
by
day
are
in
a
measure
fashioning
our
i
sometimes
think
that
even
my
little
mandarin
and
this
which
by
the
way
i
brought
from
india
are
exerting
a
mysterious
but
none
the
less
real
influence
upon
my
work
great
god
ernest
replied
i
have
had
the
identical
thought
how
very
strange
clarke
exclaimed
with
seeming
surprise
it
is
said
tritely
but
truly
that
great
minds
travel
the
same
roads
ernest
observed
inwardly
pleased
no
the
older
man
subtly
remarked
but
they
reach
the
same
conclusion
by
a
different
route
and
you
attach
serious
importance
to
our
fancy
why
not
clarke
was
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
bust
of
balzac
a
man
genius
is
commensurate
with
his
ability
of
absorbing
from
life
the
elements
essential
to
his
artistic
completion
balzac
possessed
this
power
in
a
remarkable
degree
but
strange
to
say
it
was
evil
that
attracted
him
most
he
absorbed
it
as
a
sponge
absorbs
water
perhaps
because
there
was
so
little
of
it
in
his
own
he
must
have
purified
the
atmosphere
around
him
for
miles
by
bringing
all
the
evil
that
was
floating
in
the
air
or
slumbering
in
men
souls
to
the
point
of
his
pen
and
he
his
eyes
were
resting
on
shakespeare
features
as
a
man
might
look
upon
the
face
of
a
brother
he
too
was
such
a
nature
in
fact
he
was
the
most
perfect
type
of
the
artist
nothing
escaped
his
mind
from
life
and
from
books
he
drew
his
material
each
time
reshaping
it
with
a
creation
is
a
divine
prerogative
infinitely
more
wonderful
than
mere
calling
into
existence
is
the
prerogative
of
the
poet
shakespeare
took
his
colours
from
many
palettes
that
is
why
he
is
so
great
and
why
his
work
is
incredibly
greater
than
he
it
alone
explains
his
unique
achievement
who
was
he
what
education
did
he
have
what
opportunities
none
and
yet
we
find
in
his
work
the
wisdom
of
bacon
sir
walter
raleigh
fancies
and
discoveries
marlowe
verbal
thunders
and
the
mysterious
loveliness
of
mr
ernest
listened
entranced
by
the
sound
of
clarke
mellifluous
voice
he
was
indeed
a
master
of
the
spoken
word
and
possessed
a
miraculous
power
of
giving
to
the
wildest
fancies
an
air
of
vraisemblance
v
yes
said
walkham
the
sculptor
it
a
most
curious
thing
what
is
asked
ernest
who
had
been
dreaming
over
the
sphinx
that
was
looking
at
him
from
its
corner
with
the
sarcastic
smile
of
five
thousand
years
how
our
dreams
of
yesterday
stare
at
us
like
strangers
on
the
contrary
remarked
reginald
it
would
be
strange
if
they
were
still
to
know
us
in
fact
it
would
be
unnatural
the
skies
above
us
and
the
earth
underfoot
are
in
perpetual
motion
each
atom
of
our
physical
nature
is
vibrating
with
unimaginable
rapidity
change
is
identical
with
life
it
sometimes
seems
said
the
sculptor
as
if
thoughts
evaporated
like
water
why
not
under
favorable
conditions
but
where
do
they
go
surely
they
can
not
perish
utterly
yes
that
is
the
question
or
rather
it
is
not
a
question
nothing
is
ever
lost
in
the
spiritual
universe
but
what
inquired
ernest
is
the
particular
reason
for
your
reflection
it
is
this
the
sculptor
replied
i
had
a
striking
motive
and
lost
it
do
you
remember
he
continued
speaking
to
reginald
the
narcissus
i
was
working
on
the
last
time
when
you
called
at
my
studio
yes
it
was
a
striking
thing
and
impressed
me
very
much
though
i
can
not
recall
it
at
the
moment
well
it
was
a
commission
an
eccentric
young
millionaire
had
offered
me
eight
thousand
dollars
for
it
i
had
an
absolutely
original
conception
but
i
can
not
execute
it
it
as
if
a
breeze
had
carried
it
away
that
is
very
regrettable
well
i
should
say
so
replied
the
sculptor
ernest
smiled
for
everybody
knew
of
walkham
domestic
troubles
having
twice
figured
in
the
divorce
court
he
was
at
present
defraying
the
expenses
of
three
households
the
sculptor
had
meanwhile
seated
himself
at
reginald
unintentionally
scanning
a
typewritten
page
that
was
lying
before
him
like
all
artists
something
of
a
madman
and
something
of
a
child
he
at
first
glanced
over
its
contents
distractedly
then
with
an
interest
so
intense
that
he
was
no
longer
aware
of
the
impropriety
of
his
action
by
jove
he
cried
what
is
this
it
an
epic
of
the
french
revolution
reginald
replied
not
without
surprise
but
man
do
you
know
that
i
have
discovered
my
motive
in
it
what
do
you
mean
asked
ernest
looking
first
at
reginald
and
then
at
walkham
whose
sanity
he
began
to
doubt
listen
and
the
sculptor
read
trembling
with
emotion
a
long
passage
whose
measured
cadence
delighted
ernest
ear
without
however
enlightening
his
mind
as
to
the
purport
of
walkham
cryptic
remark
reginald
said
nothing
but
the
gleam
in
his
eye
showed
that
this
time
at
least
his
interest
was
alert
walkham
saw
the
hopelessness
of
making
clear
his
meaning
without
an
explanation
i
forget
you
have
a
sculptor
mind
i
am
so
constituted
that
with
me
all
impressions
are
immediately
translated
into
the
sense
of
form
i
do
not
hear
music
i
see
it
rise
with
domes
and
spires
with
painted
windows
and
arabesques
the
scent
of
the
rose
is
to
me
tangible
i
can
almost
feel
it
with
my
hand
so
your
prose
suggested
to
me
by
its
rhythmic
flow
something
which
at
first
indefinite
crystallised
finally
into
my
lost
conception
of
narcissus
it
is
extraordinary
murmured
reginald
i
had
not
dreamed
of
it
so
you
do
not
think
it
rather
fantastic
remarked
ernest
circumscribing
his
true
meaning
no
it
is
quite
possible
perhaps
his
narcissus
was
engaging
the
strata
of
my
mind
while
i
was
writing
this
passage
and
surely
it
would
be
strange
if
the
undercurrents
of
our
mind
were
not
reflected
in
our
style
do
you
mean
then
that
a
subtle
psychologist
ought
to
be
able
to
read
beneath
and
between
our
lines
not
only
what
we
express
but
also
what
we
leave
unexpressed
undoubtedly
even
if
while
we
are
writing
we
are
unconscious
of
our
state
of
mind
that
would
open
a
new
field
to
psychology
only
to
those
that
have
the
key
that
can
read
the
hidden
symbols
it
is
to
me
a
that
every
below
or
above
the
threshold
of
consciousness
must
of
a
necessity
leave
its
imprint
faintly
or
clearly
as
the
case
may
be
upon
our
activities
this
may
explain
why
books
that
seem
intolerably
dull
to
the
majority
delight
the
hearts
of
the
few
ernest
interjected
yes
to
the
few
that
possess
the
key
i
distinctly
remember
how
an
uncle
of
mine
once
laid
down
a
discussion
on
higher
mathematics
and
blushed
fearfully
when
his
innocent
wife
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
man
who
had
written
it
was
a
roué
then
the
seemingly
most
harmless
books
may
secretly
possess
the
power
of
scattering
in
young
minds
the
seed
of
corruption
walkham
remarked
if
they
happen
to
understand
clarke
observed
thoughtfully
i
can
very
well
conceive
of
a
lecherous
of
the
calculus
or
of
a
reporter
story
of
a
picnic
in
which
burnt
under
the
surface
undiscoverable
save
to
the
initiate
the
tragic
passion
of
tristram
and
iseult
vi
several
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
conversation
in
reginald
studio
the
spring
was
now
well
advanced
and
had
sprinkled
the
meadows
with
flowers
and
the
bookshelves
of
the
reviewers
with
fiction
the
latter
ernest
turned
to
good
account
but
from
the
flowers
no
poem
blossomed
forth
in
writing
about
other
men
books
he
almost
forgot
that
the
springtide
had
brought
to
him
no
bouquet
of
song
only
now
and
then
like
a
rippling
of
water
disquietude
troubled
his
soul
the
strange
personality
of
the
master
of
the
house
had
enveloped
the
lad
thoughts
with
an
impenetrable
maze
the
day
before
jack
had
come
on
a
flying
visit
from
harvard
but
even
he
was
unable
to
free
soul
from
the
obsession
of
reginald
clarke
ernest
was
lazily
stretching
himself
on
a
couch
waving
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
to
reginald
who
was
writing
at
his
desk
your
friend
jack
is
delightful
reginald
remarked
looking
up
from
his
papers
and
his
hair
contrasts
prettily
with
the
gold
in
yours
i
should
imagine
that
you
are
temperamental
antipodes
so
we
are
but
friendship
bridges
the
chasm
between
how
long
have
you
known
him
we
have
been
chums
ever
since
our
sophomore
year
what
attracted
you
in
him
it
is
no
simple
matter
to
define
exactly
one
likes
and
dislikes
even
a
tiny
protoplasmic
animal
appears
to
be
highly
complex
under
the
microscope
how
can
we
hope
to
analyse
with
any
degree
of
certitude
our
souls
especially
when
under
the
influence
of
feeling
we
see
as
through
a
glass
darkly
it
is
true
that
personal
feeling
colours
our
spectacles
and
distorts
the
perspective
still
we
should
not
shrink
from
we
must
learn
to
see
clearly
into
our
own
hearts
if
we
would
give
vitality
to
our
work
indiscretion
is
the
better
part
of
literature
and
it
behooves
us
to
hound
down
each
delicate
elusive
shadow
of
emotion
and
convert
it
into
copy
it
is
because
i
am
so
that
i
realise
the
complexity
of
my
nature
and
am
at
a
loss
to
define
my
emotions
conflicting
forces
sway
us
hither
and
thither
without
neutralising
each
other
physicology
is
physics
there
were
many
things
to
attract
me
to
jack
he
was
subtler
more
sympathetic
more
feminine
perhaps
than
the
rest
of
my
that
i
have
noticed
in
fact
his
lashes
are
those
of
a
girl
you
still
care
for
him
very
much
it
is
a
matter
of
caring
we
are
two
beings
that
live
one
life
a
sort
of
psychic
siamese
twins
almost
why
the
matter
is
very
simple
our
hearts
root
in
the
same
soil
the
same
books
have
nourished
us
the
same
great
winds
have
shaken
our
being
and
the
same
sunshine
called
forth
the
beautiful
blossom
of
friendship
he
struck
me
if
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
as
a
rather
commonplace
companion
there
is
in
him
a
hidden
sweetness
and
a
depth
of
feeling
which
only
intimate
contact
reveals
he
is
now
taking
his
course
at
harvard
and
for
two
months
we
have
not
met
yet
so
many
invisible
threads
of
common
experience
unite
us
that
we
could
meet
after
years
and
still
be
near
each
other
you
are
very
young
reginald
replied
what
do
you
mean
ah
never
mind
so
you
do
not
believe
that
two
hearts
may
ever
beat
as
one
no
that
is
an
auditory
delusion
not
even
two
clocks
beat
in
unison
there
is
always
a
discrepancy
infinitesimal
perhaps
but
a
discrepancy
nevertheless
a
sharp
ring
of
the
bell
interrupted
the
conversation
a
moment
later
a
curly
head
peeped
through
the
door
hello
ernest
how
are
you
old
man
the
intruder
cried
with
a
laugh
in
his
voice
then
noticing
clarke
he
shook
hands
with
the
great
man
unceremoniously
with
the
nonchalance
of
the
healthy
young
animal
bred
in
the
atmosphere
of
an
american
college
his
touch
seemed
to
thrill
clarke
who
breathed
heavily
and
then
stepped
to
the
window
as
if
to
conceal
the
flush
of
vitality
on
his
cheek
it
was
a
breath
of
springtide
that
jack
had
brought
with
him
youth
is
a
prince
charming
to
shrivelled
veins
the
pressure
of
his
hand
imparts
a
spark
of
animation
and
middle
age
unfolds
its
petals
in
his
presence
as
a
sunflower
gazing
at
late
noon
once
more
upon
its
lord
i
have
come
to
take
ernest
away
from
you
said
jack
he
looks
a
trifle
paler
than
usual
and
a
day
outing
will
stir
the
red
corpuscles
in
his
blood
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
take
very
good
care
of
him
reginald
replied
where
shall
we
go
ernest
asked
but
he
did
not
hear
the
answer
for
reginald
scepticisms
had
more
deeply
impressed
him
than
he
cared
to
confess
to
himself
vii
the
two
boys
had
bathed
their
souls
in
the
and
their
eyes
in
light
the
tide
of
humanity
jostling
against
them
had
carried
their
feet
to
the
lion
palace
from
there
seated
at
table
and
quenching
their
thirst
with
they
watched
the
feverish
palpitations
of
the
city
pulsating
in
the
veins
of
coney
island
to
which
they
had
drifted
from
brighton
beach
ernest
blew
thoughtful
rings
of
smoke
into
the
air
do
you
notice
the
ferocious
look
in
the
mien
of
the
average
frequenter
of
this
island
resort
he
said
to
jack
whose
eyes
following
the
impulse
of
his
more
robust
youth
were
examining
specimens
of
feminine
flotsam
on
the
waves
of
the
crowd
it
is
he
continued
speaking
to
himself
for
want
of
an
audience
the
american
who
is
in
for
having
a
time
and
he
is
going
to
get
it
like
a
huntsman
he
follows
the
scent
of
happiness
but
i
warrant
that
always
it
eludes
him
perhaps
his
mad
race
is
only
the
epitome
of
humanity
vain
pursuit
of
pleasure
the
eternal
cry
that
is
never
answered
but
jack
was
not
listening
there
are
times
in
the
life
of
every
man
when
a
petticoat
is
more
attractive
to
him
than
all
the
philosophy
of
the
world
ernest
was
a
little
hurt
and
it
was
not
without
some
silent
remonstrance
that
he
acquiesced
when
jack
invited
to
their
table
two
creatures
that
once
were
women
why
but
they
are
interesting
i
can
not
find
so
they
both
had
seen
better
times
of
course
then
money
losses
came
with
work
in
shop
or
factory
and
the
voice
of
the
tempter
in
the
commercial
wilderness
one
a
frail
nervous
little
creature
who
had
instinctively
chosen
a
seat
at
ernest
side
kept
prattling
in
his
ear
ready
to
tell
the
story
of
her
life
to
any
one
who
was
willing
to
treat
her
to
a
drink
something
in
her
demeanour
interested
him
and
then
i
had
a
stroke
of
luck
the
manager
of
a
vaudeville
was
my
friend
and
decided
to
give
me
a
trial
he
thought
i
had
a
voice
they
called
me
betsy
the
hyacinth
girl
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
people
liked
to
hear
me
but
i
suppose
that
was
because
i
was
new
after
a
month
or
two
they
discharged
me
and
why
i
suppose
i
was
just
used
up
that
all
frightful
i
never
had
much
of
a
voice
and
the
tobacco
smoke
and
the
wine
i
love
wine
she
gulped
down
her
glass
and
do
you
like
your
present
occupation
why
not
am
i
not
young
am
i
not
pretty
this
she
said
not
parrotwise
but
with
a
simple
coquettishness
that
was
all
her
own
on
the
way
to
the
steamer
a
few
moments
later
ernest
asked
jack
and
you
really
enjoyed
this
conversation
did
you
do
you
mean
this
why
yes
she
was
very
agreeable
ernest
frowned
we
twenty
ernest
and
then
you
see
it
like
a

susie
was
that
her
name
yes
so
she
had
a
name
of
course
she
should
it
should
be
a
number
they
may
not
be
pillars
of
society
still
they
human
yes
said
ernest
that
is
the
most
horrible
part
of
it
viii
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
swift
and
sure
the
prow
of
the
parted
the
silvery
foam
the
smell
of
young
flesh
peals
of
laughter
a
breathless
pianola
the
tripping
of
voices
husked
with
drink
and
voices
soft
with
love
the
shrill
accents
of
vulgarity
hustling
waiters
bourgeois
couples
tired
families
of
four
and
upward
sleeping
children
a
boy
selling
candy
the
crying
of
babies
the
two
friends
were
sitting
on
the
upper
deck
muffled
in
their
long
in
the
distance
the
empire
city
rose
radiant
from
the
mist
say
ernest
you
should
spout
some
poetry
as
of
old
are
your
lips
stricken
mute
or
are
you
still
thinking
of
coney
island
oh
no
the
swift
wind
has
taken
it
away
i
am
clean
i
am
pure
life
has
passed
me
it
has
kissed
me
but
it
has
left
no
trace
he
looked
upon
the
face
of
his
friend
their
hands
met
they
felt
with
keen
enjoyment
the
beauty
of
the
night
of
their
friendship
and
of
the
city
beyond
then
ernest
lips
moved
softly
musically
twitching
with
a
strange
ascetic
passion
that
trembled
in
his
voice
as
he
began
huge
monsters
rise
into
the
air
her
babylonian
towers
while
on
high
like
serpents
glide
the
swift
trains
by
or
underfoot
creep
to
their
secret
lair
a
thousand
lights
are
jewels
in
her
hair
the
sea
her
girdle
and
her
crown
the
sky
her
throbs
the
fevered
pulses
fly
immense
defiant
breathless
she
stands
there
and
ever
listens
in
the
ceaseless
din
waiting
for
him
her
lover
who
shall
come
whose
singing
lips
shall
boldly
claim
their
own
and
render
sonant
what
in
her
was
dumb
the
splendour
and
the
madness
and
the
sin
her
dreams
in
iron
and
her
thoughts
of
stone
he
paused
the
boat
glided
on
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
a
word
after
a
while
jack
broke
the
silence
and
are
you
dreaming
of
becoming
the
lyric
mouth
of
the
city
of
giving
utterance
to
all
its
yearnings
its
in
iron
and
its
thoughts
of
stone
no
replied
ernest
simply
not
yet
it
is
strange
to
what
impressions
the
brain
will
respond
in
clarke
house
in
the
midst
of
inspiring
things
inspiration
failed
me
but
while
i
was
with
that
girl
an
idea
came
to
me
an
idea
big
real
will
it
deal
with
her
ernest
smiled
oh
no
she
personally
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
least
not
directly
it
was
the
commotion
of
blood
and
brain
the
air
the
change
i
do
know
what
what
will
it
be
asked
jack
with
interest
all
alert
a
play
a
wonderful
play
and
its
heroine
will
be
a
princess
a
little
princess
with
a
yellow
veil
what
of
the
plot
that
i
shall
not
tell
you
in
fact
i
shall
not
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
it
will
take
you
all
by
surprise
and
the
public
by
storm
so
it
will
be
playable
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
you
will
see
it
on
broadway
within
a
year
and
he
added
graciously
i
will
let
you
have
two
for
the
first
night
they
both
chuckled
at
the
thought
and
their
hearts
leaped
within
them
i
hope
you
will
finish
it
soon
jack
observed
after
a
while
you
have
done
much
of
late
a
similar
reflection
was
on
my
mind
when
you
came
yesterday
that
accounts
for
the
low
spirits
in
which
you
found
me
ah
indeed
jack
replied
measuring
ernest
with
a
look
of
wonder
but
now
your
face
is
aglow
it
seems
that
the
blood
rushes
to
your
head
swifter
at
the
call
of
an
idea
than
at
the
kiss
of
a
girl
thank
god
ernest
remarked
with
a
sigh
of
relief
mighty
forces
within
me
are
fashioning
the
limpid
thought
passion
may
grip
us
by
the
throat
momentarily
upon
our
backs
we
may
feel
the
lashes
of
desire
and
bathe
our
souls
in
flames
of
many
hues
but
the
joy
of
activity
is
the
ultimate
passion
ix
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
work
was
to
ernest
what
the
sting
of
pleasure
is
to
the
average
human
animal
the
of
his
mental
forces
gave
him
the
sensuous
satisfaction
of
a
woman
embrace
his
eyes
sparkled
his
muscle
tightened
the
joy
of
creation
was
upon
him
often
very
material
reasons
like
stone
weights
tied
to
the
wings
of
a
bird
stayed
the
flight
of
his
imagination
magazines
were
waiting
for
his
copy
and
he
was
not
in
the
position
to
let
them
wait
they
supplied
his
bread
and
butter
between
the
bread
and
butter
however
the
play
was
growing
scene
by
scene
in
the
lone
hours
of
the
night
he
spun
upon
the
loom
of
his
fancy
a
brilliant
weft
of
swift
desire
heavy
perfumed
oriental
interwoven
with
bits
of
gruesome
tenderness
the
thread
of
his
own
life
intertwined
with
the
thread
of
the
story
all
genuine
art
is
autobiography
it
is
not
however
necessarily
a
revelation
of
the
artist
actual
self
but
of
a
myriad
of
potential
selves
ah
our
own
potential
selves
they
are
sometimes
beautiful
often
horrible
and
always
fascinating
they
loom
to
heavens
none
too
high
for
our
reach
they
stray
to
yawning
hells
beneath
our
very
feet
the
man
who
encompasses
heaven
and
hell
is
a
perfect
man
but
there
are
many
heavens
and
more
hells
the
artist
snatches
fire
from
both
surely
the
assassin
feels
no
more
intensely
the
lust
of
murder
than
the
poet
who
depicts
it
in
glowing
words
the
things
he
writes
are
as
real
to
him
as
the
things
that
he
lives
but
in
his
realm
the
poet
is
supreme
his
hands
may
be
red
with
blood
or
white
with
leprosy
he
still
remains
king
woe
to
him
however
if
he
transcends
the
limits
of
his
kingdom
and
translates
into
action
the
secret
of
his
dreams
the
throng
that
before
applauded
him
will
stone
his
quivering
body
or
nail
to
the
cross
his
delicate
hands
and
feet
sometimes
days
passed
before
ernest
could
concentrate
his
mind
upon
his
play
then
the
fever
seized
him
again
and
he
strung
pearl
on
pearl
line
on
line
without
entrusting
a
word
to
paper
even
to
discuss
his
work
before
it
had
received
the
final
would
have
seemed
indecent
to
him
reginald
too
seemed
to
be
in
a
turmoil
of
work
ernest
had
little
chance
to
speak
to
him
and
to
drop
even
a
hint
of
his
plans
between
the
courses
at
breakfast
would
have
been
desecration
sunset
followed
sunset
night
followed
night
the
stripling
april
had
made
room
for
the
lady
may
the
play
was
almost
completed
in
mind
and
he
thought
with
a
little
shudder
of
the
physical
travail
of
the
actual
writing
he
felt
that
the
transcript
from
brain
to
paper
would
demand
all
his
powers
for
of
late
his
thoughts
seemed
strangely
evanescent
they
seemed
to
run
away
from
him
whenever
he
attempted
to
seize
them
the
day
was
glad
with
sunshine
and
he
decided
to
take
a
long
walk
in
the
solitude
of
the
palisades
to
steady
hand
and
nerve
for
the
final
task
he
told
reginald
of
his
intention
but
met
with
little
response
reginald
face
was
wan
and
bore
the
peculiar
pallor
of
one
who
had
worked
late
at
night
you
must
be
frightfully
busy
ernest
asked
with
genuine
concern
so
i
am
reginald
replied
i
always
work
in
a
white
heat
i
am
restless
nervous
feverish
and
can
find
no
peace
until
i
have
given
utterance
to
all
that
clamours
after
birth
what
is
it
that
is
so
engaging
your
mind
the
epic
of
the
french
revolution
oh
no
i
should
never
have
undertaken
that
i
have
done
a
stroke
of
work
on
it
for
several
weeks
in
fact
ever
since
walkham
called
i
simply
could
it
seemed
as
if
a
rough
hand
had
in
some
way
destroyed
the
web
of
my
thought
poetry
in
the
writing
is
like
red
hot
glass
before
the
has
fashioned
it
into
birds
and
trees
and
strange
fantastic
shapes
a
draught
caused
by
the
opening
of
a
door
may
distort
it
but
at
present
i
am
engaged
upon
more
important
work
i
am
modelling
a
vessel
not
of
glass
but
of
molten
gold
you
make
me
exceedingly
anxious
to
know
what
you
have
in
store
for
us
it
seems
to
me
you
have
reached
a
point
where
even
you
can
no
longer
surpass
yourself
reginald
smiled
your
praise
is
too
generous
yet
it
warms
like
sunshine
i
will
confess
that
my
conception
is
unique
it
combines
with
the
ripeness
of
my
technique
the
freshness
of
a
second
spring
ernest
was
bubbling
with
anticipated
delights
his
soul
responded
to
reginald
touch
as
a
harp
to
the
winds
when
he
cried
shall
we
be
privileged
to
see
it
reginald
eyes
were
already
straying
back
to
his
writing
table
if
the
gods
are
propitious
he
remarked
i
shall
complete
it
is
my
reception
and
i
have
half
promised
to
read
it
then
perhaps
i
shall
be
in
the
position
soon
to
let
you
see
my
play
let
us
hope
so
reginald
replied
the
egotism
of
the
artist
had
once
more
chained
him
to
his
work
x
that
night
a
brilliant
crowd
had
gathered
in
reginald
clarke
house
from
the
studio
and
the
adjoining
salon
arose
a
continual
murmur
of
voices
on
bare
white
throats
jewels
shone
as
if
in
each
a
soul
were
imprisoned
and
voluptuously
rustled
the
silk
that
clung
to
the
fair
slim
forms
of
its
bearers
in
an
undulating
caress
subtle
perfumes
emanated
from
the
hair
and
the
hands
of
syren
women
commingling
with
the
soft
plump
scent
of
their
flesh
fragrant
tapers
burning
in
precious
crystal
globules
stained
with
exquisite
colours
sprinkled
their
shimmering
light
over
the
fashionable
assemblage
and
lent
a
false
radiance
to
the
faces
of
the
men
while
in
the
hair
and
the
jewels
of
the
women
each
ray
seemed
to
dance
like
an
imp
with
its
mate
a
seat
like
a
throne
covered
with
furs
of
tropic
beasts
of
prey
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
in
the
full
glare
of
the
light
waiting
for
the
monarch
to
come
above
were
arranged
with
artistic
weird
oriental
draperies
resembling
a
crimson
canopy
in
the
total
effect
chattering
visitors
were
standing
in
groups
or
had
seated
themselves
on
the
divans
and
chairs
that
were
scattered
in
seeming
disorder
throughout
the
salon
there
were
critics
and
writers
and
men
of
the
world
everybody
who
was
anybody
and
a
little
bigger
than
somebody
else
was
holding
court
in
his
own
small
circle
of
enthusiastic
admirers
the
bohemian
element
was
subdued
but
not
entirely
lacking
the
magic
of
reginald
clarke
name
made
stately
dames
blind
to
the
presence
of
some
individuals
whom
they
would
have
passed
on
the
street
without
recognition
ernest
surveyed
this
gorgeous
assembly
with
the
absent
look
of
a
not
that
his
sensuous
soul
was
unsusceptible
to
the
atmosphere
of
culture
and
corruption
that
permeated
the
whole
nor
to
the
dazzling
colour
effects
that
tantalised
while
they
delighted
the
eye
but
they
shrivelled
into
insignificance
before
the
splendour
of
his
inner
vision
a
radiant
dreamland
palace
his
play
had
risen
from
the
night
of
inchoate
thought
it
was
wonderful
it
was
real
and
needed
for
its
completion
only
the
detail
of
actual
construction
and
now
the
characters
were
hovering
in
the
recesses
of
his
brain
were
yearning
to
leave
that
labyrinth
to
become
real
beings
of
paper
and
ink
he
would
probably
have
tarried
overlong
in
this
fanciful
mansion
had
not
the
reappearance
of
an
unexpected
guest
broken
his
reverie
jack
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
thought
you
a
hundred
miles
away
from
here
that
shows
that
you
no
longer
care
for
me
jack
playfully
answered
when
our
friendship
was
young
you
always
had
a
presentiment
of
my
presence
ah
perhaps
i
had
but
tell
me
where
do
you
hail
from
clarke
called
me
up
on
the
telephone
you
know
i
suppose
it
was
meant
as
a
surprise
for
you
and
you
certainly
looked
surprised
not
even
pleasantly
i
am
really
at
work
but
you
know
how
it
is
sometimes
a
little
imp
whispers
into
my
ears
daring
me
to
do
a
thing
which
i
know
is
foolish
but
what
of
it
my
legs
are
strong
enough
not
to
permit
my
follies
to
overtake
me
it
was
certainly
good
of
you
to
come
in
fact
you
make
me
very
glad
i
feel
that
i
need
you
i
do
know
why
the
feeling
came
suddenly
suddenly
as
you
i
only
know
i
need
you
how
long
can
you
stay
i
must
leave
you
morning
i
have
to
hustle
somewhat
you
know
my
examinations
are
taking
place
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
got
to
cram
up
a
lot
of
things
still
remarked
ernest
your
visit
will
repay
you
for
the
loss
of
time
clarke
will
read
to
us
his
masterpiece
what
is
it
i
do
know
i
only
know
it
the
real
thing
it
worth
all
the
wisdom
professors
may
administer
to
you
in
concentrated
doses
at
five
thousand
a
year
come
now
jack
could
not
help
saying
is
your
memory
giving
way
do
you
remember
your
own
days
in
college
especially
the
mathematical
examinations
you
know
that
your
marks
came
always
pretty
near
the
absolute
zero
jack
cried
ernest
in
honest
indignation
not
the
last
time
the
last
time
i
did
flunk
no
because
your
sonnet
on
cartesian
geometry
roused
even
the
to
compassion
and
do
you
remember
professor
squeeler
whose
heart
seemed
to
leap
with
delight
whenever
he
could
tell
you
that
in
spite
of
incessant
toil
on
your
part
he
had
again
flunked
you
in
physics
with
and
a
half
per
and
he
would
raise
the
mark
to
sixty
god
forgive
him
i
can
not
here
their
exchange
of
reminiscences
was
interrupted
there
was
a
stir
the
little
potentates
of
conversation
hastened
to
their
seats
before
their
minions
had
wholly
deserted
them
the
king
was
moving
to
his
throne
assuredly
reginald
clarke
had
the
bearing
of
a
king
leisurely
he
took
his
seat
under
the
canopy
a
hush
fell
on
the
audience
not
a
fan
stirred
as
he
slowly
unfolded
his
manuscript
xi
the
music
of
reginald
clarke
intonation
captivated
every
ear
voluptuously
in
measured
cadence
it
rose
and
fell
now
full
and
strong
like
the
sound
of
an
organ
now
soft
and
clear
like
the
tinkling
of
bells
his
voice
detracted
by
its
very
tunefulness
from
what
he
said
the
powerful
spell
charmed
even
ernest
accustomed
ear
the
first
page
gracefully
glided
from
reginald
hand
to
the
carpet
before
the
boy
dimly
realised
that
he
was
intimately
familiar
with
every
word
that
fell
from
reginald
lips
when
the
second
page
slipped
with
seeming
carelessness
from
the
reader
hand
a
sudden
shudder
ran
through
the
boy
frame
it
was
as
if
an
icy
hand
had
gripped
his
heart
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
this
was
more
than
mere
coincidence
it
was
plagiarism
he
wanted
to
cry
out
but
the
room
swam
before
his
eyes
surely
he
must
be
dreaming
it
was
a
dream
the
faces
of
the
audience
the
lights
reginald
jack
all
phantasmagoria
of
a
dream
perhaps
he
had
been
ill
for
a
long
time
perhaps
clarke
was
reading
the
play
for
him
he
did
not
remember
having
written
it
but
he
probably
had
fallen
sick
after
its
completion
what
strange
pranks
our
memories
will
play
us
but
no
he
was
not
dreaming
and
he
had
not
been
ill
he
could
endure
the
horrible
uncertainty
no
longer
his
overstrung
nerves
must
find
relaxation
in
some
way
or
break
with
a
twang
he
turned
to
his
friend
who
was
listening
with
rapt
attention
jack
jack
he
whispered
what
is
it
that
is
my
play
you
mean
that
you
inspired
it
no
i
have
written
it
or
rather
was
going
to
write
it
wake
up
ernest
you
are
mad
no
in
all
seriousness
it
is
mine
i
told
you
do
you
remember
when
we
returned
from
coney
island
that
i
was
writing
a
play
ah
but
not
this
play
yes
this
play
i
conceived
it
i
practically
wrote
it
the
more
the
pity
that
clarke
had
preconceived
it
but
it
is
mine
did
you
tell
him
a
word
about
it
no
to
be
sure
did
you
leave
the
manuscript
in
your
room
i
had
in
fact
not
written
a
line
of
it
no
i
had
not
begun
the
actual
writing
why
should
a
man
of
clarke
reputation
plagiarise
your
plays
written
or
unwritten
i
can
see
no
reason
but
tut
tut
for
already
this
whispered
conversation
had
elicited
a
look
like
a
stab
from
a
lady
before
them
ernest
held
fast
to
the
edge
of
a
chair
he
must
cling
to
some
reality
or
else
drift
rudderless
in
a
dim
sea
of
vague
apprehensions
or
was
jack
right
was
his
mind
giving
way
no
no
no
there
must
be
a
monstrous
secret
somewhere
but
what
matter
did
anything
matter
he
had
called
on
his
mate
like
a
ship
lost
in
the
fog
for
the
first
time
he
had
not
responded
he
had
not
understood
the
bitterness
of
tears
rose
to
the
boy
eyes
above
it
all
melodiously
ebbed
and
flowed
the
rich
accents
of
reginald
clarke
ernest
listened
to
the
words
of
his
own
play
coming
from
the
older
mouth
the
horrible
fascination
of
the
scene
held
him
entranced
he
saw
the
creations
of
his
mind
pass
in
review
before
him
as
a
man
might
look
upon
the
face
of
his
double
grinning
at
him
from
behind
a
door
in
the
hideous
hours
of
night
they
were
all
there
the
mad
king
the
courtiers
the
prince
the
who
had
loved
a
jester
better
than
her
royal
mate
and
the
fruit
of
their
shameful
alliance
the
princess
marigold
a
creature
woven
of
sunshine
and
sin
swiftly
the
action
progressed
shadows
of
impending
death
darkened
the
house
of
the
king
in
the
horrible
agony
of
the
rack
the
old
jester
confessed
stripped
of
his
cap
and
bells
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
blood
he
looked
so
pathetically
funny
that
the
princess
marigold
could
not
help
laughing
between
her
tears
the
queen
stood
there
all
trembling
and
pale
without
a
complaint
she
saw
her
lover
die
the
executioner
sword
smote
the
old
man
head
straight
from
the
trunk
it
rolled
at
the
feet
of
the
king
who
tossed
it
to
marigold
the
little
princess
kissed
it
and
covered
the
grinning
horror
with
her
yellow
veil
the
last
words
died
away
there
was
no
applause
only
silence
all
were
stricken
with
the
dread
that
men
feel
in
the
house
of
god
or
his
awful
presence
in
genius
but
the
boy
lay
back
in
his
chair
the
cold
sweat
had
gathered
on
his
brow
and
his
temples
throbbed
nature
had
mercifully
clogged
his
head
with
blood
the
rush
of
it
drowned
the
crying
voice
of
the
nerves
deadening
for
a
while
both
consciousness
and
pain
xii
somehow
the
night
had
passed
somehow
in
bitterness
in
anguish
but
it
had
passed
ernest
lips
were
parched
and
sleeplessness
had
left
its
trace
in
the
black
rings
under
the
eyes
when
the
next
morning
he
confronted
reginald
in
the
studio
reginald
was
sitting
at
the
in
his
most
characteristic
pose
supporting
his
head
with
his
hand
and
looking
with
clear
piercing
eyes
searchingly
at
the
boy
yes
he
observed
it
a
most
curious
psychical
phenomenon
you
can
not
imagine
how
real
it
all
seemed
to
me
the
boy
spoke
painfully
dazed
as
if
struck
by
a
blow
even
now
it
is
as
if
something
has
gone
from
me
some
struggling
thought
that
i
can
not
can
not
remember
reginald
regarded
him
as
a
physical
experimenter
might
look
upon
the
subject
of
a
particularly
baffling
mental
disease
you
must
not
think
my
boy
that
i
bear
you
any
malice
for
your
extraordinary
delusion
before
jack
went
away
he
gave
me
an
exact
account
of
all
that
has
happened
divers
incidents
recurred
to
him
from
which
it
appears
that
at
various
times
in
the
past
you
have
been
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
collapse
a
nervous
collapse
what
was
the
use
of
this
term
but
a
euphemism
for
insanity
do
not
despair
dear
child
reginald
caressingly
remarked
your
disorder
is
not
hopeless
not
incurable
such
crises
come
to
every
man
who
writes
it
is
the
tribute
we
pay
to
the
lords
of
song
the
minnesinger
of
the
past
wrote
with
his
heart
blood
but
we
moderns
dip
our
pen
into
the
sap
of
our
nerves
we
analyse
life
love
art
and
the
dissecting
knife
that
we
use
on
other
men
souls
finally
turns
against
ourselves
but
what
shall
a
man
do
shall
he
sacrifice
art
to
hygiene
and
surrender
the
one
attribute
that
makes
him
chiefest
of
created
things
animals
too
think
some
walk
on
two
legs
but
introspection
differentiates
man
from
the
rest
shall
we
yield
up
the
sweet
consciousness
of
self
that
we
derive
from
the
analysis
of
our
emotion
for
the
contentment
of
the
bull
that
ruminates
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
or
the
healthful
stupidity
of
a
mule
assuredly
not
but
what
shall
a
man
do
ah
that
i
can
not
tell
mathematics
offers
definite
problems
that
admit
of
a
definite
solution
life
states
its
problems
with
less
exactness
and
offers
for
each
a
different
solution
one
and
one
are
two
and
psychical
values
on
each
manipulation
will
yield
a
different
result
still
your
case
is
quite
clear
you
have
overworked
yourself
in
the
past
mentally
and
emotionally
you
have
sown
unrest
and
must
not
be
surprised
if
neurasthenia
is
the
harvest
thereof
do
you
think
that
i
should
go
to
some
sanitarium
the
boy
falteringly
asked
god
forbid
go
to
the
seashore
somewhere
where
you
can
sleep
and
play
take
your
body
along
but
leave
your
brain
behind
at
least
do
not
take
more
of
it
with
you
than
is
necessary
the
summer
season
in
atlantic
city
has
just
begun
there
as
everywhere
in
american
society
you
will
be
much
more
welcome
if
you
come
without
brains
reginald
tone
reassured
ernest
a
little
timidly
he
dared
approach
once
more
the
strange
event
that
had
wrought
such
havoc
with
his
nervous
equilibrium
how
do
you
account
for
my
strange
obsession
one
might
almost
call
it
a
mania
if
it
could
be
accounted
for
it
would
not
be
strange
can
you
suggest
no
possible
explanation
perhaps
a
stray
leaf
on
my
desk
a
few
indications
of
the
plot
a
remark
who
knows
perhaps
is
floating
in
the
air
perhaps
but
we
had
better
not
talk
of
it
now
it
would
needlessly
excite
you
you
are
right
answered
ernest
gloomily
let
us
not
talk
of
it
but
whatever
may
be
said
it
is
a
marvellous
play
you
flatter
me
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
do
equally
well
some
day
ah
no
the
boy
replied
looking
up
to
reginald
with
admiration
you
are
the
master
xiii
lazily
ernest
stretched
his
limbs
on
the
beach
of
atlantic
city
the
sea
that
purger
of
sick
souls
had
washed
away
the
fever
and
the
fret
of
the
last
few
days
the
wind
was
in
his
hair
and
the
spray
was
in
his
breath
while
the
rays
of
the
sun
kissed
his
bare
arms
and
legs
he
rolled
over
in
the
glittering
sand
in
the
sheer
joy
of
living
now
and
then
a
wavelet
stole
far
into
the
beach
as
if
to
caress
him
but
pined
away
ere
it
could
reach
its
goal
it
was
as
if
the
enamoured
sea
was
stretching
out
its
arms
to
him
who
knows
perhaps
through
the
clear
water
some
nymph
or
a
young
with
the
tang
of
the
sea
in
his
hair
was
peering
amorously
at
the
boy
red
mouth
the
people
of
the
deep
love
the
red
warm
blood
of
human
kind
it
is
always
the
young
that
they
lure
to
their
watery
haunts
never
the
shrivelled
limbs
that
totter
shivering
to
the
grave
such
fancies
came
to
ernest
as
he
lay
on
the
shore
in
his
bathing
attire
happy
thoughtless
animal
the
sun
and
the
sea
seemed
to
him
two
lovers
vying
for
his
favor
the
sudden
change
of
environment
had
brought
complete
relaxation
and
had
quieted
his
rebellious
assertive
soul
he
was
no
longer
a
solitary
unit
but
one
with
wind
and
water
herb
and
beach
and
shell
almost
voluptuously
his
hand
toyed
with
the
hot
sand
that
glided
caressingly
through
his
fingers
and
buried
his
breast
and
shoulder
under
its
glittering
burden
a
summer
girl
who
passed
lowered
her
eyes
coquettishly
he
watched
her
without
stirring
even
to
open
his
mouth
or
to
smile
would
have
seemed
too
much
exertion
thus
he
lay
for
hours
when
at
length
noon
drew
nigh
it
cost
him
a
great
effort
of
will
to
shake
off
his
drowsy
mood
and
exchange
his
airy
costume
for
the
conventional
habilaments
of
the
he
had
taken
lodgings
in
a
fashionable
hotel
an
unusual
stroke
of
good
luck
that
paid
outrageously
well
had
made
it
possible
for
him
to
idle
for
a
time
without
a
thought
of
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
making
money
one
single
article
to
which
he
signed
his
name
only
with
reluctance
had
brought
to
him
more
gear
than
a
series
of
golden
sonnets
surely
he
thought
the
social
revolution
ought
to
begin
from
above
what
right
has
the
bricklayer
to
grumble
when
he
receives
for
a
work
almost
more
than
i
for
a
song
thus
soliloquising
he
reached
the
the
scene
that
unfolded
itself
before
him
was
typical
the
table
the
women
the
luncheon
was
already
in
full
course
when
he
came
he
mumbled
an
apology
and
seated
himself
on
the
only
remaining
chair
next
to
a
youth
who
reminded
him
of
a
dummy
with
slight
weariness
his
eyes
wandered
in
all
directions
for
more
congenial
faces
when
they
were
arrested
by
a
lady
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
she
was
clad
in
a
silk
robe
with
curiously
embroidered
that
revealed
a
nervous
and
delicate
throat
the
rich
effect
of
the
was
relieved
by
the
studied
simplicity
with
which
her
heavy
hair
was
gathered
in
a
single
knot
her
face
was
turned
away
from
him
but
there
was
something
in
the
carriage
of
her
head
that
struck
him
as
familiar
when
at
last
she
looked
him
in
the
face
the
glass
almost
fell
from
his
hand
it
was
ethel
brandenbourg
she
seemed
to
notice
his
embarrassment
and
smiled
when
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
he
knew
by
the
haunting
sweetness
of
the
voice
that
he
was
not
mistaken
tell
me
she
said
wistfully
you
have
forgotten
me
they
all
have
he
hastened
to
assure
her
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
he
recollected
now
that
he
had
first
been
introduced
to
her
in
walkham
house
some
years
ago
when
a
mere
college
boy
he
had
been
privileged
to
attend
one
of
that
master
famous
receptions
she
had
looked
quite
resolute
and
very
happy
then
not
at
all
like
the
woman
who
had
stared
so
strangely
at
reginald
in
the
broadway
restaurant
he
regarded
this
encounter
as
very
fortunate
he
knew
so
much
of
her
personal
history
that
it
almost
seemed
to
him
as
if
they
had
been
intimate
for
years
she
too
felt
on
familiar
ground
with
him
neither
as
much
as
whispered
the
name
of
reginald
clarke
yet
it
was
he
and
the
knowledge
of
what
he
was
to
them
that
linked
their
souls
with
a
common
bond
xiv
it
was
the
third
day
after
their
meeting
hour
by
hour
their
intimacy
had
increased
ethel
was
sitting
in
a
large
she
restlessly
fingered
her
parasol
mechanically
describing
magic
circles
in
the
sand
ernest
lay
at
her
feet
with
his
knees
clasped
between
his
hands
he
gazed
into
her
eyes
why
are
you
trying
so
hard
to
make
love
to
me
the
woman
asked
with
the
smile
with
which
the
eve
near
thirty
receives
the
homage
of
a
boy
there
is
an
element
of
insincerity
in
that
smile
but
it
is
a
weapon
of
defence
against
love
artillery
sometimes
indeed
the
pleading
in
the
boy
eyes
and
the
cry
of
the
blood
pierces
the
woman
smiling
superiority
she
listens
loves
and
loses
ethel
brandenbourg
was
listening
but
the
idea
of
love
had
not
yet
entered
into
her
mind
her
interest
in
ernest
was
due
in
part
to
his
youth
and
the
trembling
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
of
love
but
what
probably
attracted
her
most
powerfully
was
the
fact
that
he
intimately
knew
the
man
who
still
held
her
woman
heart
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
it
was
half
in
play
therefore
that
she
had
asked
him
that
question
why
did
he
make
love
to
her
he
did
not
know
perhaps
it
was
the
irresistible
desire
to
be
petted
which
young
poets
share
with
domesticated
cats
but
what
should
he
tell
her
polite
platitudes
were
out
of
place
between
them
besides
he
knew
the
penalty
of
all
tender
entanglements
women
treat
love
as
if
it
were
an
extremely
tenuous
wire
that
can
be
drawn
out
indefinitely
this
is
a
very
expensive
process
it
costs
us
the
most
precious
the
only
irretrievable
thing
in
the
universe
time
and
to
him
time
was
song
for
money
he
did
not
care
the
lord
had
hallowed
his
lips
with
rhythmic
speech
only
in
the
intervals
of
his
singing
might
he
listen
to
the
voice
of
his
heart
strangest
of
all
watches
that
tells
the
time
not
by
minutes
and
hours
but
by
the
coming
and
going
of
love
the
woman
beside
him
seemed
to
read
his
thoughts
child
child
she
said
why
will
you
toy
with
love
like
jehovah
he
is
a
jealous
god
and
nothing
but
the
whole
heart
can
placate
him
woe
to
the
woman
who
takes
a
poet
for
a
lover
i
admit
it
is
fascinating
but
it
is
playing
in
fact
it
is
fatal
art
or
love
will
come
to
harm
no
man
can
minister
equally
to
both
a
genuine
poet
is
incapable
of
loving
a
woman
pshaw
you
exaggerate
of
course
there
is
a
measure
of
truth
in
what
you
say
but
it
is
only
one
side
of
the
truth
and
the
truth
you
know
is
always
in
fact
it
often
has
more
than
two
faces
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
cared
deeply
for
the
women
to
whom
my
was
written
and
you
will
not
deny
that
it
is
genuine
god
forbid
only
you
have
been
using
the
wrong
preposition
you
should
have
said
that
it
was
written
at
them
ernest
stared
at
her
in
wonder
by
jove
you
are
too
devilishly
clever
he
exclaimed
after
a
little
silence
he
said
not
without
hesitation
and
do
you
apply
your
theory
to
all
artists
or
only
to
us
makers
of
rhyme
to
all
she
replied
he
looked
at
her
questioningly
yes
she
said
with
a
new
sadness
in
her
voice
i
too
have
paid
the
price
you
mean
i
loved
and
art
that
was
the
sacrifice
perhaps
you
have
chosen
the
better
part
ernest
said
without
conviction
no
she
replied
my
tribute
was
brought
in
vain
this
she
said
calmly
but
ernest
knew
that
her
words
were
of
tragic
import
you
love
him
still
he
observed
simply
ethel
made
no
reply
sadness
clouded
her
face
like
a
veil
or
like
a
grey
mist
over
the
face
of
the
waters
her
eyes
went
out
to
the
sea
following
the
sombre
flight
of
the
in
that
moment
he
could
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
with
infinite
tenderness
but
tenderness
between
man
and
woman
is
like
a
match
in
a
the
least
provocation
and
an
amorous
explosion
will
ensue
tumbling
down
the
of
platonic
affection
if
he
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
the
moment
the
wine
of
the
springtide
would
set
their
blood
afire
and
from
the
flames
within
us
there
is
no
escape
come
come
she
said
you
do
not
love
me
he
protested
ah
she
cried
triumphantly
how
many
sonnets
would
you
give
for
me
if
you
were
a
usurer
in
gold
instead
of
in
rhyme
i
would
ask
how
many
dollars
but
it
is
unjust
to
pay
in
a
coin
that
we
value
little
to
a
man
starving
in
gold
mines
a
piece
of
bread
weighs
more
than
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
to
you
i
warrant
your
poems
are
the
standard
of
appreciation
how
many
would
you
give
for
me
one
two
three
more
because
you
think
love
would
repay
you
with
compound
interest
she
observed
merrily
he
laughed
and
when
love
turns
to
laughter
the
danger
is
passed
for
the
moment
xv
thus
three
weeks
passed
without
apparent
change
in
their
relations
ernest
possessed
a
personal
magnetism
that
always
emanating
from
him
was
felt
most
deeply
when
withdrawn
he
was
at
all
times
involuntarily
exerting
his
power
which
she
ever
resisted
always
on
the
alert
always
warding
off
when
at
last
pressure
of
work
made
his
immediate
departure
for
new
york
imperative
he
had
not
apparently
gained
the
least
ground
but
ethel
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
was
fascinated
if
not
in
love
the
personal
fascination
was
supplemented
by
a
motherly
feeling
toward
ernest
that
sensuous
in
essence
was
in
itself
not
far
removed
from
love
she
struggled
bravely
and
with
external
success
against
her
emotions
never
losing
sight
of
the
fact
that
twenty
and
thirty
are
fifty
increasingly
aware
of
her
own
weakness
she
constantly
attempted
to
lead
the
conversation
into
impersonal
channels
speaking
preferably
of
his
work
tell
me
she
said
negligently
fanning
herself
what
new
inspiration
have
you
drawn
from
your
stay
at
the
seaside
why
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
volumes
and
volumes
of
it
i
shall
write
the
great
novel
of
my
life
after
i
am
once
more
quietly
installed
at
riverside
drive
the
great
american
novel
she
rejoined
perhaps
who
will
be
your
hero
clarke
there
was
a
slight
touch
of
malice
in
her
words
or
rather
in
the
pause
between
the
penultimate
word
and
the
last
ernest
detected
its
presence
and
knew
that
her
love
for
reginald
was
dead
stiff
and
cold
it
lay
in
her
heart
chamber
beside
how
many
others
all
emboxed
in
the
coffin
of
memory
no
he
replied
after
a
while
a
little
piqued
by
her
suggestion
clarke
is
not
the
hero
what
makes
you
think
that
he
casts
a
spell
on
everything
i
do
dear
child
she
replied
i
know
him
he
can
not
fail
to
impress
his
powerful
personality
upon
all
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
to
the
injury
of
their
intellectual
independence
moreover
he
is
so
brilliant
and
says
everything
so
much
better
than
anybody
else
that
by
his
very
splendor
he
discourages
effort
in
others
at
best
his
influence
will
shape
your
development
according
to
the
tenets
of
his
mind
curious
subtle
and
corrupted
you
will
become
mentally
distorted
like
one
of
those
hunchback
japanese
trees
infinitely
wrinkled
and
infinitely
grotesque
whose
laws
of
growth
are
not
determined
by
nature
but
by
the
diseased
imagination
of
the
east
i
am
no
weakling
ernest
asserted
and
your
picture
of
clarke
is
altogether
out
of
perspective
his
splendid
successes
are
to
me
a
source
of
constant
inspiration
we
have
some
things
in
common
but
i
realise
that
it
is
along
entirely
different
lines
that
success
will
come
to
me
he
has
never
sought
to
influence
me
in
fact
i
never
received
the
smallest
suggestion
from
him
here
the
princess
marigold
seemed
to
peer
at
him
through
the
veil
of
the
past
but
he
waved
her
aside
as
for
my
story
he
continued
you
need
not
go
so
far
out
of
your
way
to
find
the
leading
character
who
can
it
be
ethel
remarked
with
a
merry
twinkle
you
ethel
he
said
sulkingly
be
serious
you
know
that
it
is
you
i
am
immensely
flattered
she
replied
really
nothing
pleases
me
better
than
to
be
immortalised
in
print
since
i
have
little
hope
nowadays
of
perpetuating
my
name
by
virtue
of
pencil
or
brush
i
have
been
put
into
novels
before
and
am
consumed
with
curiosity
to
hear
the
plot
of
yours
if
you
do
mind
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
just
yet
ernest
said
it
going
to
be
called
leontina
that
you
but
all
depends
on
the
treatment
you
know
it
does
matter
much
what
you
say
so
long
as
you
say
it
well
that
what
counts
at
any
rate
any
indication
of
the
plot
at
this
stage
would
be
decidedly
inadequate
i
think
you
are
right
she
ventured
by
all
means
choose
your
own
time
to
tell
me
let
talk
of
something
else
have
you
written
anything
since
your
delightful
book
of
verse
last
spring
surely
now
is
your
singing
season
by
the
time
we
are
thirty
the
springs
of
pure
lyric
passion
are
usually
exhausted
ethel
inquiry
somehow
startled
him
in
truth
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
answer
a
remark
relative
to
his
play
clarke
play
rose
to
the
threshold
of
his
lips
but
he
almost
bit
his
tongue
as
soon
as
he
realised
that
the
strange
delusion
which
had
possessed
him
that
night
still
dominated
the
undercurrents
of
his
cerebration
no
he
had
accomplished
but
little
during
the
last
few
months
at
least
by
way
of
creative
literature
so
he
replied
that
he
had
made
money
that
is
something
he
said
besides
who
can
turn
out
a
masterpiece
every
week
an
artist
brain
is
not
a
machine
and
in
the
respite
from
creative
work
i
have
gathered
strength
for
the
future
but
he
added
slightly
annoyed
you
are
not
listening
his
exclamation
brought
her
back
from
the
train
of
thoughts
that
his
words
had
suggested
for
in
his
reasoning
she
had
recognised
the
same
arguments
that
she
had
hourly
repeated
to
herself
in
defence
of
her
inactivity
when
she
was
living
under
the
baneful
influence
of
reginald
clarke
yes
baneful
for
the
first
time
she
dared
to
confess
it
to
herself
in
a
flash
the
truth
dawned
upon
her
that
it
was
not
her
love
alone
but
something
else
something
irresistable
and
very
mysterious
that
had
dried
up
the
well
of
creation
in
her
could
it
be
that
the
same
power
was
now
exerting
its
influence
upon
the
struggling
soul
of
this
talented
boy
rack
her
brains
as
she
might
she
could
not
definitely
formulate
her
apprehensions
and
a
troubled
look
came
into
her
eyes
ethel
the
boy
repeated
impatiently
why
are
you
not
listening
do
you
realise
that
i
must
leave
you
in
half
an
hour
she
looked
at
him
with
deep
tenderness
something
like
a
tear
lent
a
soft
radiance
to
her
large
eyes
ernest
saw
it
and
was
profoundly
moved
in
that
moment
he
loved
her
passionately
foolish
boy
she
said
softly
then
lowering
her
voice
to
a
whisper
you
may
kiss
me
before
you
go
his
lips
gently
touched
hers
but
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
pressed
her
mouth
upon
his
in
a
long
kiss
ernest
drew
back
a
little
awkwardly
he
had
not
been
kissed
like
this
before
poet
though
you
are
ethel
whispered
you
have
not
yet
learned
to
kiss
she
was
deeply
agitated
when
she
noticed
that
his
hand
was
fumbling
for
the
watch
in
his
she
suddenly
released
him
and
said
a
little
hurt
no
you
must
not
miss
your
train
go
by
all
means
vainly
ernest
remonstrated
with
her
go
to
him
she
said
and
again
go
to
him
with
a
heavy
heart
the
boy
obeyed
he
waved
his
hat
to
her
once
more
from
below
and
then
rapidly
disappeared
in
the
crowd
for
a
moment
strange
misgivings
cramped
her
heart
and
something
within
her
called
out
to
him
do
not
go
do
not
return
to
that
house
but
no
sound
issued
from
her
lips
worldly
wisdom
had
sealed
them
had
stifled
the
inner
voice
and
soon
the
boy
golden
head
was
swallowed
up
in
the
distance
xvi
while
the
train
sped
to
new
york
ethel
brandenbourg
was
the
one
object
engaging
ernest
mind
he
still
felt
the
pressure
of
her
lips
upon
his
and
his
nostrils
dilated
at
the
thought
of
the
fragrance
of
her
hair
brushing
against
his
forehead
but
the
moment
his
foot
touched
the
that
was
to
take
him
to
manhattan
the
past
three
weeks
were
for
the
time
being
at
least
completely
obliterated
from
his
memory
all
his
other
interests
that
he
had
suppressed
in
her
company
because
she
had
no
part
in
them
came
rushing
back
to
him
he
anticipated
with
delight
his
meeting
with
reginald
clarke
the
personal
attractiveness
of
the
man
had
never
seemed
so
powerful
to
ernest
as
when
he
had
not
heard
from
him
for
some
time
reginald
letters
were
always
brief
professional
writers
he
was
wont
to
say
can
not
afford
to
put
fine
feeling
into
their
private
correspondence
they
must
turn
it
into
copy
he
longed
to
sit
with
the
master
in
the
studio
when
the
last
rays
of
the
daylight
were
tremulously
falling
through
the
stained
window
and
to
discuss
far
into
the
darkening
night
philosophies
young
and
old
he
longed
for
voice
his
little
mannerisms
the
very
perfume
of
his
rooms
there
also
was
a
deluge
of
letters
likely
to
await
him
in
his
apartment
for
in
his
hurried
departure
he
had
purposely
left
his
friends
in
the
dark
as
to
his
whereabouts
only
to
jack
he
had
dropped
a
little
note
the
day
after
his
meeting
with
ethel
he
earnestly
hoped
to
find
reginald
at
home
though
it
was
well
nigh
ten
in
the
evening
and
he
cursed
the
rapid
transit
for
its
inability
to
annihilate
space
and
time
it
is
indeed
disconcerting
to
think
how
many
months
if
not
years
of
our
earthly
sojourn
the
dwellers
in
cities
spend
in
transportation
conveyances
that
must
be
set
down
as
a
dead
loss
in
the
ledger
of
life
a
nervous
impatience
against
things
material
overcame
ernest
in
the
subway
it
is
ever
the
mere
stupid
obstacle
of
matter
that
weights
down
the
wings
of
the
soul
and
prevents
it
from
soaring
upward
to
the
sun
when
at
last
he
had
reached
the
house
he
learned
from
the
that
clarke
had
gone
out
ruffled
in
temper
he
entered
his
rooms
and
went
over
his
mail
there
were
letters
from
editors
with
commissions
that
he
could
not
afford
to
reject
everywhere
newspapers
and
magazines
opened
their
yawning
mouths
to
swallow
up
what
time
he
had
he
realised
at
once
that
he
would
have
to
postpone
the
writing
of
his
novel
for
several
weeks
if
not
longer
among
the
letters
was
one
from
jack
it
bore
the
postmark
of
a
little
place
in
the
adirondacks
where
he
was
staying
with
his
parents
ernest
opened
the
missive
not
without
hesitation
on
reading
and
rereading
it
the
fine
lines
on
his
forehead
that
would
some
day
deepen
into
wrinkles
became
quite
pronounced
and
a
look
of
displeasure
darkened
his
face
something
was
wrong
with
jack
a
slight
change
that
defied
analysis
their
souls
were
out
of
tune
it
might
only
be
a
passing
disturbance
perhaps
it
was
his
own
fault
it
pained
him
nevertheless
somehow
it
seemed
of
late
that
jack
was
no
longer
able
to
follow
the
vagaries
of
his
mind
only
one
person
in
the
world
possessed
a
similar
mental
vision
only
one
seemed
to
understand
what
he
said
and
what
he
left
unsaid
reginald
clarke
being
a
man
and
poet
read
in
his
soul
as
in
an
open
book
ethel
might
have
understood
had
not
love
like
a
cloud
laid
itself
between
her
eyes
and
the
page
it
was
with
exultation
that
ernest
heard
near
midnight
the
click
of
reginald
key
in
the
door
he
found
him
unchanged
completely
radiantly
himself
reginald
possessed
the
psychic
power
of
undressing
the
soul
of
seeing
it
before
him
in
primal
nakedness
although
no
word
was
said
of
ethel
brandenbourg
except
the
mere
mention
of
her
presence
in
atlantic
city
ernest
intuitively
knew
that
reginald
was
aware
of
the
transformation
that
absence
had
wrought
in
him
in
the
presence
of
this
man
he
could
be
absolutely
himself
without
shame
or
fear
of
and
by
a
strange
metamorphosis
all
his
affection
for
ethel
and
jack
went
out
for
the
time
being
to
reginald
clarke
xvii
the
next
day
ernest
wrote
a
letter
of
more
or
less
superficial
tenderness
to
ethel
she
had
wounded
his
pride
by
proving
victorious
in
the
end
over
his
passion
and
hers
besides
he
was
in
the
throes
of
work
when
after
the
third
day
no
answer
came
he
was
inclined
to
feel
aggrieved
it
was
plain
now
that
she
had
not
cared
for
him
in
the
least
but
had
simply
played
with
him
for
lack
of
another
toy
a
flush
of
shame
rose
to
his
cheeks
at
the
thought
he
began
to
analyse
his
own
emotions
and
stunned
if
not
stabbed
his
passion
step
by
step
work
was
calling
to
him
it
was
that
which
gave
life
its
meaning
not
the
love
of
a
season
how
far
away
how
unreal
she
now
seemed
to
him
yes
she
was
right
he
had
not
cared
deeply
and
his
novel
too
would
be
written
only
her
it
was
the
heroine
of
his
story
that
absorbed
his
interest
not
the
living
prototype
once
in
a
conversation
with
reginald
he
touched
upon
the
subject
reginald
held
that
modern
taste
no
longer
permitted
even
the
photographer
to
portray
life
as
it
is
but
insisted
upon
an
individual
visualisation
no
man
he
remarked
was
ever
translated
bodily
into
fiction
in
contradiction
to
life
art
is
a
process
of
artificial
selection
bearing
in
mind
this
motive
ernest
went
to
work
to
mould
from
the
material
in
hand
a
new
ethel
more
real
than
life
unfortunately
he
found
little
time
to
devote
to
his
novel
it
was
only
when
after
a
good
day
work
a
pile
of
copy
for
a
magazine
lay
on
his
desk
that
he
could
think
of
concentrating
his
mind
upon
leontina
the
result
was
that
when
he
went
to
bed
his
imagination
was
busy
with
the
plan
of
his
book
and
the
creatures
of
his
own
brain
laid
their
fingers
on
his
eyelid
so
that
he
could
not
sleep
when
at
last
sheer
weariness
overcame
him
his
mind
was
still
at
work
not
in
orderly
sequence
but
along
trails
monstrous
and
grotesque
hobgoblins
seemed
to
steal
through
the
hall
and
leering
incubi
oppressed
his
soul
with
terrible
burdens
in
the
morning
he
awoke
unrested
the
tan
vanished
from
his
face
and
little
lines
appeared
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
it
was
as
if
his
nervous
vitality
were
sapped
from
him
in
some
unaccountable
way
he
became
excited
hysterical
often
at
night
when
he
wrote
his
for
the
magazines
fear
stood
behind
his
seat
and
only
the
buzzing
of
the
elevator
outside
brought
him
back
to
himself
in
one
of
his
morbid
moods
he
wrote
a
sonnet
which
he
showed
to
reginald
after
the
latter
return
from
a
short
trip
out
of
town
reginald
read
it
looking
at
the
boy
with
a
curious
lurking
expression
gentle
sleep
turn
not
thy
face
away
but
place
thy
finger
on
my
brow
and
take
all
burthens
from
me
and
all
dreams
that
ache
upon
mine
eyes
a
cooling
balsam
lay
seeing
i
am
aweary
of
the
day
but
lo
thy
lips
are
ashen
and
they
quake
what
spectral
vision
sees
thou
that
can
shake
thy
sweet
composure
and
thy
heart
dismay
perhaps
some
murderer
cruel
eye
agleam
is
fixed
upon
me
or
some
monstrous
dream
might
bring
such
fearful
guilt
upon
the
head
of
my
unvigilant
soul
as
would
arouse
the
borgian
snake
from
her
envenomed
bed
or
startle
nero
in
his
golden
good
stuff
reginald
remarked
laying
down
the
manuscript
when
did
you
write
it
the
night
when
you
were
out
of
town
ernest
rejoined
i
see
reginald
replied
there
was
something
startling
in
his
intonation
that
at
once
aroused
ernest
attention
what
do
you
see
he
asked
quickly
nothing
reginald
replied
with
immovable
calm
only
that
your
state
of
nerves
is
still
far
from
satisfactory
xviii
after
ernest
departure
ethel
brandenbourg
heart
was
swaying
hither
and
thither
in
a
hurricane
of
conflicting
feelings
before
she
had
time
to
gain
an
emotional
equilibrium
his
letter
had
hurled
her
back
into
chaos
a
false
ring
somewhere
in
ernest
words
reechoing
with
an
volume
of
sound
stifled
the
voice
of
love
his
jewelled
sentences
glittered
but
left
her
cold
they
lacked
that
spontaneity
which
renders
even
simple
and
hackeneyed
phrases
wonderful
and
unique
ethel
clearly
realised
that
her
hold
upon
the
boy
imagination
had
been
a
fleeting
midsummer
night
charm
and
that
a
word
from
reginald
lips
had
broken
the
potency
of
her
spell
she
almost
saw
the
shadow
of
reginald
visage
hovering
over
ernest
letter
and
leering
at
her
from
between
the
lines
in
sinister
triumph
finally
reason
came
and
whispered
to
her
that
it
was
extremely
unwise
to
give
her
heart
into
the
keeping
of
a
boy
his
love
she
knew
would
have
been
exacting
irritating
at
times
he
would
have
asked
her
to
sympathise
with
every
phase
of
his
life
and
would
have
expected
active
interest
on
her
part
in
much
that
she
had
done
with
long
ago
thus
untruth
would
have
stolen
into
her
life
and
embittered
it
when
mates
are
unequal
love
must
paint
its
cheeks
and
in
certain
moods
at
least
hide
its
face
under
a
mask
its
lips
may
be
honeyed
but
it
brings
fret
and
sorrow
in
its
train
these
things
she
told
herself
over
and
over
again
while
she
penned
a
cool
and
calculating
answer
to
ernest
letter
she
rewrote
it
many
times
and
every
time
it
became
more
difficult
to
reply
at
last
she
put
her
letter
aside
for
a
few
days
and
when
it
fell
again
into
her
hand
it
seemed
so
unnatural
and
strained
that
she
destroyed
it
thus
several
weeks
had
passed
and
ernest
no
longer
exclusively
occupied
her
mind
when
one
day
early
in
september
while
glancing
over
a
magazine
she
came
upon
his
name
in
the
table
of
contents
once
more
she
saw
the
boy
wistful
face
before
her
and
a
trembling
something
stirred
in
her
heart
her
hand
shook
as
she
cut
the
pages
and
a
mist
of
tears
clouded
her
vision
as
she
attempted
to
read
his
poem
it
was
a
piece
of
sombre
brilliance
like
monks
half
crazed
with
mystic
devotion
the
poet
thoughts
flitted
across
the
page
it
was
the
wail
of
a
soul
that
feels
reason
slipping
from
it
and
beholds
madness
rise
over
its
life
like
a
great
pale
moon
a
strange
unrest
emanated
from
it
and
took
possession
of
her
and
again
with
an
insight
that
was
prophetic
she
distinctly
recognised
behind
the
vague
fear
that
had
haunted
the
poet
the
figure
of
reginald
clarke
a
dream
struggling
to
consciousness
staggered
her
by
its
vividness
she
saw
clarke
as
she
had
seen
him
in
days
gone
by
grotesquely
transformed
into
a
slimy
whose
hungry
mouths
shut
sucking
upon
her
and
whose
thousand
tentacles
encircled
her
form
she
closed
her
eyes
in
horror
at
the
reminiscence
and
in
that
moment
it
became
clear
to
her
that
she
must
take
into
her
hands
the
salvation
of
ernest
fielding
from
the
clutches
of
the
malign
power
that
had
mysteriously
enveloped
his
life
xix
the
summer
was
brief
and
already
by
the
middle
of
september
many
had
returned
to
the
pleasures
of
urban
life
ethel
was
among
the
for
after
her
resolve
to
enter
the
life
of
the
young
poet
once
more
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
stay
away
from
the
city
much
longer
her
plan
was
all
ready
before
attempting
to
see
ernest
she
would
go
to
meet
reginald
and
implore
him
to
free
the
boy
from
his
hideous
spell
an
element
of
curiosity
unconsciously
entered
her
determination
when
years
ago
she
and
clarke
had
parted
the
man
had
seemed
for
once
greatly
disturbed
and
had
promised
in
his
agitation
that
some
day
he
would
communicate
to
her
what
would
exonerate
him
in
her
eyes
she
had
answered
that
all
words
between
them
were
purposeless
and
that
she
hoped
never
to
see
his
face
again
the
experience
that
the
years
had
brought
to
her
instead
of
elucidating
the
mystery
of
reginald
personality
had
on
the
contrary
made
his
behaviour
appear
more
and
more
unaccountable
she
had
more
than
once
caught
herself
wishing
to
meet
him
again
and
to
analyse
dispassionately
the
puzzling
influences
he
had
exerted
upon
her
and
she
could
at
last
view
him
dispassionately
there
was
triumph
in
that
she
was
dimly
aware
that
something
had
passed
from
her
something
by
which
he
had
held
her
and
without
which
his
magnetism
was
unable
to
play
upon
her
so
when
walkham
sent
her
an
invitation
to
one
of
his
artistic
at
homes
she
accepted
in
the
hope
of
meeting
reginald
it
was
his
frequentation
of
walkham
house
that
had
for
several
years
effectively
barred
her
foot
from
crossing
the
threshold
it
was
with
a
very
strange
feeling
she
greeted
the
many
familiar
faces
at
walkham
now
and
when
toward
ten
reginald
entered
politely
bowing
in
answer
to
the
welcome
from
all
sides
her
heart
beat
in
her
like
a
drum
but
she
calmed
herself
and
catching
his
eye
so
arranged
it
that
early
in
the
evening
they
met
in
an
alcove
of
the
it
was
inevitable
reginald
said
i
expected
it
yes
she
replied
we
were
bound
to
meet
like
a
great
rush
of
water
memory
came
back
to
her
he
was
still
horribly
fascinating
as
of
old
only
she
was
no
longer
susceptible
to
his
fascination
he
had
changed
somewhat
in
those
years
the
lines
about
his
mouth
had
grown
harder
and
a
look
had
come
into
his
eyes
only
for
a
moment
as
he
looked
at
her
a
flash
of
tenderness
seemed
to
come
back
to
them
then
he
said
with
a
touch
of
sadness
why
should
the
first
word
between
us
be
a
lie
ethel
made
no
answer
reginald
looked
at
her
half
in
wonder
and
said
and
is
your
love
for
the
boy
so
great
that
it
overcame
your
hate
of
me
ah
he
knew
she
winced
he
has
told
you
not
a
word
there
was
something
superhuman
in
his
power
of
penetration
why
should
she
wear
a
mask
before
him
when
his
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
god
pierced
to
the
core
of
her
being
no
she
replied
it
is
not
love
but
compassion
for
him
compassion
yes
compassion
for
your
victim
you
mean
reginald
i
am
all
ear
i
implore
you
speak
you
have
ruined
one
life
he
raised
his
eyebrows
derogatively
yes
she
continued
fiercely
ruined
it
is
not
that
enough
i
have
never
wilfully
ruined
any
one
life
you
have
ruined
mine
wilfully
how
else
shall
i
explain
your
conduct
i
warned
you
warning
indeed
the
warning
that
the
snake
gives
to
the
sparrow
helpless
under
its
gaze
ah
but
who
tells
you
that
the
snake
is
to
blame
is
it
not
rather
the
occult
power
that
prescribes
with
blood
on
brazen
scroll
the
law
of
our
being
this
is
no
solace
to
the
sparrow
but
whatever
may
be
said
let
us
drop
the
past
let
us
consider
the
present
i
beg
of
you
leave
this
boy
let
him
develop
without
your
attempting
to
stifle
the
life
in
him
or
impressing
upon
it
the
stamp
of
your
alien
mind
ethel
he
protested
you
are
unjust
if
you
knew
then
an
idea
seemed
to
take
hold
of
him
he
looked
at
her
curiously
what
if
i
knew
she
asked
you
shall
know
he
said
simply
are
you
strong
strong
to
withstand
anything
at
your
hand
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
give
me
nothing
that
you
can
take
away
no
he
remarked
nothing
yes
you
have
changed
still
when
i
look
upon
you
the
ghosts
of
the
past
seem
to
rise
like
live
things
we
both
have
changed
we
meet
now
upon
equal
grounds
you
are
no
longer
the
idol
i
made
of
you
do
you
think
that
to
the
idol
this
might
be
a
relief
not
a
humiliation
it
is
a
terrible
torture
to
sit
in
state
with
lips
eternally
shut
sometimes
there
comes
over
the
most
reticent
of
us
a
desire
to
break
through
the
eternal
loneliness
that
surrounds
the
soul
it
is
this
feeling
that
prompts
madmen
to
tear
off
their
clothes
and
exhibit
their
nakedness
in
the
it
madness
on
my
part
or
a
whim
or
i
do
know
what
but
it
pleases
me
that
you
should
know
the
truth
you
promised
me
long
ago
that
i
should
i
will
redeem
my
promise
and
i
will
tell
you
another
thing
that
you
will
find
hard
to
believe
and
that
is
that
i
loved
you
ethel
smiled
a
little
sceptically
you
have
loved
often
no
he
replied
loved
seriously
loved
i
have
only
once
xx
they
were
sitting
in
a
little
italian
restaurant
where
they
had
often
in
the
old
days
lingered
late
into
the
night
over
a
glass
of
lacrimæ
christi
but
no
pale
ghost
of
the
past
rose
from
the
wine
only
a
wriggling
something
with
serpent
eyes
that
sent
cold
shivers
down
her
spine
and
held
her
speechless
and
entranced
when
their
order
had
been
filled
and
the
waiter
had
posted
himself
at
a
respectful
distance
reginald
began
at
first
leisurely
a
man
of
the
world
but
as
he
proceeded
a
strange
exultation
seemed
to
possess
him
and
from
his
eyes
leaped
the
flame
of
the
mystic
you
must
pardon
me
he
commenced
if
i
monopolise
the
conversation
but
the
revelations
i
have
to
make
are
of
such
a
nature
that
i
may
well
claim
your
attention
i
will
start
with
my
earliest
childhood
you
remember
the
picture
of
me
that
was
taken
when
i
was
five
she
remembered
indeed
each
detail
of
his
life
was
deeply
engraven
on
her
mind
at
that
time
he
continued
i
was
not
held
to
be
particularly
bright
the
reason
was
that
my
mind
being
and
extraordinarily
receptive
needed
a
stimulus
from
without
the
moment
i
was
sent
to
school
however
a
curious
metamorphosis
took
place
in
me
i
may
say
that
i
became
at
once
the
most
brilliant
boy
in
my
class
you
know
that
to
this
day
i
have
always
been
the
most
striking
figure
in
any
circle
in
which
i
have
ever
moved
ethel
nodded
assent
silently
watching
the
speaker
she
saw
a
gleam
of
the
truth
from
afar
but
still
very
distant
and
very
dim
reginald
lifted
the
glass
against
the
light
and
gulped
its
contents
then
in
a
lower
voice
he
recommenced
like
the
chameleon
i
have
the
power
of
absorbing
the
colour
of
my
environment
do
you
mean
that
you
have
the
power
of
absorbing
the
special
virtues
of
other
people
she
interjected
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
oh
she
cried
for
in
a
many
things
had
become
clear
to
her
for
the
first
time
she
realised
still
vaguely
but
with
increasing
vividness
the
hidden
causes
of
her
ruin
and
still
more
plainly
the
horrible
danger
of
ernest
fielding
he
noticed
her
agitation
and
a
look
of
psychological
curiosity
came
into
his
eyes
ah
but
that
is
not
all
he
observed
smilingly
that
is
nothing
we
all
possess
that
faculty
in
a
degree
the
secret
of
my
strength
is
my
ability
to
reject
every
element
that
is
harmful
or
inessential
to
the
completion
of
my
self
this
did
not
come
to
me
easily
nor
without
a
struggle
but
now
looking
back
upon
my
life
many
things
become
transparent
that
were
obscure
even
to
me
at
the
time
i
can
now
follow
the
threads
in
the
intricate
web
of
my
fate
and
discover
in
the
wilderness
of
meshes
a
design
awful
and
grandly
planned
his
voice
shook
with
conviction
as
he
uttered
these
words
there
was
something
strangely
gruesome
in
this
man
it
was
thus
that
she
had
pictured
to
herself
the
of
some
terrible
and
mysterious
religion
demanding
a
human
sacrifice
to
appease
the
hunger
of
his
god
she
was
fascinated
by
the
spell
of
his
personality
and
listened
with
a
feeling
not
far
removed
from
awe
but
reginald
suddenly
changed
his
tone
and
proceeded
in
a
more
conversational
manner
the
first
friend
i
ever
cared
for
was
a
boy
marvellously
endowed
for
the
study
of
mathematics
at
the
time
of
our
first
meeting
at
school
i
was
unable
to
solve
even
the
simplest
algebraical
problem
but
we
had
been
together
only
for
half
a
month
when
we
exchanged
parts
it
was
i
who
was
the
mathematical
genius
now
whereas
he
became
hopelessly
dull
and
stuttered
through
his
recitations
only
with
a
struggle
that
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
then
i
discarded
him
heartless
you
say
i
have
come
to
know
better
have
you
ever
tasted
a
bottle
of
wine
that
had
been
uncorked
for
a
long
time
if
you
have
you
have
probably
found
it
flat
the
essence
was
gone
evaporated
thus
it
is
when
we
care
for
people
probably
no
assuredly
there
is
some
principle
prisoned
in
their
souls
or
in
the
windings
of
their
brains
which
when
escaped
leaves
them
insipid
unprofitable
and
devoid
of
interest
to
us
sometimes
this
essence
not
necessarily
the
finest
element
in
a
man
or
a
woman
nature
but
that
we
lack
disappears
in
fact
it
invariably
disappears
it
may
be
that
it
has
been
transformed
in
the
processes
of
their
growth
it
may
also
be
that
it
has
utterly
vanished
by
some
inadvertence
or
that
we
ourselves
have
absorbed
it
then
we
throw
them
away
ethel
asked
pale
but
a
shudder
passed
through
her
body
and
she
clinched
her
glass
nervously
at
that
moment
reginald
resembled
a
veritable
prince
of
darkness
sinister
and
beautiful
painted
by
the
hand
of
a
modern
master
then
for
a
space
he
again
became
the
man
of
the
world
smiling
and
he
filled
the
glasses
took
a
long
sip
of
the
wine
and
resumed
his
narrative
that
boy
was
followed
by
others
i
absorbed
many
useless
things
and
some
that
were
evil
i
realised
that
i
must
direct
my
absorptive
propensities
this
i
did
i
selected
selected
well
and
all
the
time
the
terrible
power
of
which
i
was
only
half
conscious
grew
within
me
it
is
indeed
a
terrible
power
she
cried
all
the
more
terrible
for
its
subtlety
had
i
not
myself
been
its
victim
i
should
not
now
find
it
possible
to
believe
in
it
the
invisible
hand
that
smites
in
the
dark
is
certainly
more
fearful
than
a
visible
foe
it
is
also
more
merciful
think
how
much
you
would
have
suffered
had
you
been
conscious
of
your
loss
still
it
seems
even
now
to
me
that
it
can
not
have
been
an
utter
irreparable
loss
there
is
no
action
without
reaction
even
i
even
we
must
have
received
from
you
some
compensation
for
what
you
have
taken
away
in
the
ordinary
processes
of
life
the
law
of
action
and
reaction
is
indeed
potent
but
no
law
is
without
exception
think
of
radium
for
instance
with
its
constant
and
seemingly
inexhaustible
outflow
of
energy
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
imagine
but
our
scientific
men
have
accepted
it
as
a
fact
why
should
we
find
it
more
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
tremendous
and
infinite
absorptive
element
i
feel
sure
that
it
must
somewhere
exist
but
every
phenomenon
in
the
physical
world
finds
its
counterpart
in
the
psychical
universe
there
are
that
radiate
without
loss
of
energy
but
also
without
increase
and
there
are
souls
the
reverse
of
radium
with
unlimited
absorptive
capacities
she
observed
with
a
shudder
and
her
face
blanched
no
he
said
do
say
that
and
then
he
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
in
stature
his
face
was
ablaze
like
the
face
of
a
god
in
every
age
he
replied
with
solemnity
there
are
giants
who
attain
to
a
greatness
which
by
natural
growth
no
men
could
ever
have
reached
but
in
their
youth
a
vision
came
to
them
which
they
set
out
to
seek
they
take
the
stones
of
fancy
to
build
them
a
palace
in
the
kingdom
of
truth
projecting
into
reality
dreams
monstrous
and
impossible
often
they
fail
and
tumbling
from
their
airy
heights
end
a
quixotic
career
some
succeed
they
are
the
chosen
carpenter
sons
they
are
who
have
laid
down
the
law
of
a
world
for
milleniums
to
come
or
simple
corsicans
before
whose
eagle
eye
have
quaked
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
but
to
accomplish
their
mission
they
need
a
will
of
iron
and
the
wit
of
a
hundred
men
and
from
the
iron
they
take
the
strength
and
from
a
hundred
men
brains
they
absorb
their
wisdom
divine
missionaries
they
appear
in
all
departments
of
life
in
their
hand
is
gathered
the
gold
of
the
world
mighty
potentates
of
peace
and
war
they
unlock
new
seas
and
from
distant
continents
lift
the
bars
they
accomplish
what
nations
dared
not
hope
with
titan
strides
they
scale
the
stars
and
succeed
where
millions
fail
in
art
they
live
the
makers
of
new
periods
the
dreamers
of
new
styles
they
make
themselves
the
vocal
of
god
homer
and
shakespeare
hugo
and
balzac
they
concentrate
the
dispersed
rays
of
a
thousand
lesser
luminaries
in
one
singing
flame
that
like
a
giant
torch
lights
up
humanity
path
she
gazed
at
him
the
light
had
gone
from
his
visage
he
paused
exhausted
but
even
then
he
looked
the
incarnation
of
a
force
no
less
terrible
no
less
grand
she
grasped
the
immensity
of
his
conception
but
her
woman
soul
rebelled
at
the
horrible
injustice
to
those
whose
light
is
extinguished
as
hers
had
been
to
feed
an
alien
flame
and
then
for
a
moment
she
saw
the
pale
face
of
ernest
staring
at
her
out
of
the
wine
cruel
she
sobbed
how
cruel
what
matter
he
asked
their
strength
is
taken
from
them
but
the
spirit
of
humanity
as
embodied
in
us
triumphantly
marches
on

reginald
revelations
were
followed
by
a
long
silence
interrupted
only
by
the
officiousness
of
the
waiter
the
spell
once
broken
they
exchanged
a
number
of
more
or
less
irrelevant
observations
ethel
mind
returned
again
and
again
to
the
word
he
had
not
spoken
he
had
said
nothing
of
the
immediate
bearing
of
his
monstrous
power
upon
her
own
life
and
that
of
ernest
fielding
at
last
somewhat
timidly
she
approached
the
subject
you
said
you
loved
me
she
remarked
i
did
but
why
then
i
could
not
help
it
did
you
ever
make
the
slightest
attempt
in
the
horrible
night
hours
i
struggled
against
it
i
even
implored
you
to
leave
me
ah
but
i
loved
you
you
would
not
be
warned
you
would
not
listen
you
stayed
with
me
and
slowly
surely
the
creative
urge
went
out
of
your
life
but
what
on
earth
could
you
find
in
my
poor
art
to
attract
you
what
were
my
pictures
to
you
i
needed
them
i
needed
you
it
was
a
certain
something
a
rich
colour
effect
perhaps
and
then
under
your
very
eyes
the
colour
that
vanished
from
your
canvases
reappeared
in
my
prose
my
style
became
more
luxurious
than
it
had
been
while
you
tortured
your
soul
in
the
vain
attempt
of
calling
back
to
your
brush
what
was
irretrievably
lost
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
would
have
laughed
in
my
face
and
i
could
not
have
endured
your
laugh
besides
i
always
hoped
until
it
was
too
late
that
i
might
yet
check
the
mysterious
power
within
me
soon
however
i
became
aware
that
it
was
beyond
my
control
the
unknown
god
whose
instrument
i
am
had
wisely
made
it
stronger
than
me
but
why
retorted
ethel
was
it
necessary
to
discard
me
like
a
garment
like
a
wanton
who
has
lost
the
power
to
please
her
frame
shook
with
the
remembered
emotion
of
that
moment
when
years
ago
he
had
politely
told
her
that
she
was
nothing
to
him
the
law
of
being
reginald
replied
almost
sadly
the
law
of
my
being
i
should
have
pitied
you
but
the
eternal
reproach
of
your
suffering
only
provoked
my
anger
i
cared
less
for
you
every
day
and
when
i
had
absorbed
all
of
you
that
my
growth
required
you
were
to
me
as
one
dead
as
a
stranger
you
were
there
was
between
us
no
further
community
of
interest
henceforth
i
knew
our
lives
must
move
in
totally
different
spheres
you
remember
that
day
when
we
said
you
mean
that
day
when
i
lay
before
you
on
my
knees
she
corrected
him
that
day
i
buried
my
last
dream
of
personal
happiness
i
would
have
gladly
raised
you
from
the
floor
but
love
was
utterly
gone
if
i
am
tenderer
than
i
am
wont
to
be
it
is
because
you
mean
so
much
to
me
as
the
symbol
of
my
renunciation
when
i
realised
that
i
could
not
even
save
the
thing
i
loved
from
myself
i
became
hardened
and
cruel
to
others
not
that
i
know
no
kindly
feeling
but
no
qualms
of
conscience
lay
their
prostrate
forms
across
my
path
there
is
nothing
in
life
for
me
but
my
mission
his
face
was
bathed
in
ecstasy
the
pupils
were
luminous
large
and
threatening
he
had
the
look
of
a
madman
or
a
prophet
after
a
while
ethel
remarked
but
you
have
grown
into
one
of
the
of
the
age
why
not
be
content
with
that
is
there
no
limit
to
your
ambition
reginald
smiled
ambition
shakespeare
stopped
when
he
had
reached
his
full
growth
when
he
had
exhausted
the
capacity
of
his
contemporaries
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
lay
down
my
pen
and
rest
and
will
you
always
continue
in
this
criminal
course
a
murderer
of
other
lives
he
looked
her
calmly
in
the
face
i
do
not
know
are
you
the
slave
of
your
unknown
god
we
are
all
slaves
marionettes
you
ernest
i
there
is
no
freedom
on
the
face
of
the
earth
nor
above
the
tiger
that
tears
a
lamb
is
not
free
i
am
not
free
you
are
not
free
all
that
happens
must
happen
no
word
that
is
said
is
said
in
vain
in
vain
is
raised
no
hand
then
ethel
retorted
eagerly
if
i
attempted
to
wrest
your
victim
from
you
i
should
also
be
the
tool
of
your
god
assuredly
but
i
am
his
chosen
can
you
can
you
not
set
him
free
i
need
him
a
little
longer
then
he
is
yours
but
can
you
not
if
i
beg
you
again
on
my
knees
at
least
loosen
his
chains
before
he
is
utterly
ruined
it
is
beyond
my
power
if
i
could
not
rescue
you
whom
i
loved
what
in
heaven
or
on
earth
can
save
him
from
his
fate
besides
he
will
not
be
utterly
ruined
it
is
only
a
part
of
him
that
i
absorb
in
his
soul
are
chords
that
i
have
not
touched
they
may
vibrate
one
day
when
he
has
gathered
new
strength
you
too
would
have
spared
yourself
much
pain
had
you
striven
to
attain
success
in
different
fields
not
where
i
had
garnered
the
harvest
of
a
lifetime
it
is
only
a
portion
of
his
talent
that
i
take
from
him
the
rest
i
can
not
harm
why
should
he
bury
that
remainder
his
eyes
strayed
through
the
window
to
the
firmament
as
if
to
say
that
words
could
no
more
bend
his
indomitable
will
than
alter
the
changeless
course
of
the
stars
ethel
had
the
wrong
she
herself
had
suffered
at
his
hands
he
could
not
be
measured
by
ordinary
standards
this
dazzling
madman
whose
diseased
had
assumed
such
uncanny
proportions
but
here
a
young
life
was
at
stake
in
her
mind
eye
she
saw
reginald
crush
between
his
relentless
hands
the
delicate
soul
of
ernest
fielding
as
a
magnificent
carnivorous
flower
might
close
its
glorious
petals
upon
a
fly
love
all
conquering
love
welled
up
in
her
she
would
fight
for
ernest
as
a
tiger
cat
fights
for
its
young
she
would
place
herself
in
the
way
of
the
awful
force
that
had
shattered
her
own
aspirations
and
save
at
any
cost
the
brilliant
boy
who
did
not
love
her
xxii
the
last
rays
of
the
late
afternoon
sun
fell
slanting
through
window
he
was
lying
on
his
couch
in
a
leaden
slumber
that
for
the
moment
at
least
was
not
even
perturbed
by
the
presence
of
reginald
clarke
the
latter
was
standing
at
the
boy
bedside
calm
unmoved
as
ever
the
excitement
of
his
conversation
with
ethel
had
left
no
trace
on
the
chiselled
contour
of
his
forehead
smilingly
fastening
an
orchid
of
an
indefinable
purple
tint
in
his
evening
coat
radiant
buoyant
with
life
he
looked
down
upon
the
sleeper
then
he
passed
his
hand
over
forehead
as
if
to
wipe
off
beads
of
sweat
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
the
boy
stirred
uneasily
when
it
was
not
withdrawn
his
countenance
twitched
in
pain
he
moaned
as
men
moan
under
the
influence
of
some
anæsthetic
without
possessing
the
power
to
break
through
the
narrow
partition
that
separates
them
from
death
on
the
one
side
and
from
consciousness
on
the
other
at
last
a
sigh
struggled
to
his
seemingly
paralysed
lips
then
another
finally
the
babbling
became
articulate
for
god
sake
he
cried
in
his
sleep
take
that
hand
away
and
all
at
once
the
benignant
smile
on
reginald
features
was
changed
to
a
look
of
savage
fierceness
he
no
longer
resembled
the
man
of
culture
but
a
disappointed
snarling
beast
of
prey
he
took
his
hand
from
ernest
forehead
and
retired
cautiously
through
the
door
hardly
had
he
disappeared
when
ernest
awoke
for
a
moment
he
looked
around
like
a
hunted
animal
then
sighed
with
relief
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hand
at
that
moment
a
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
and
reginald
calm
as
before
i
declare
he
exclaimed
you
have
certainly
been
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
it
is
laziness
ernest
replied
looking
up
rather
pleased
at
the
interruption
but
i
a
splitting
headache
perhaps
those
naps
are
not
good
for
your
health
probably
but
of
late
i
have
frequently
found
it
necessary
to
exact
from
the
the
sleep
which
the
night
refuses
me
i
suppose
it
is
all
due
to
indigestion
as
you
have
suggested
the
stomach
is
the
source
of
all
evil
it
is
also
the
source
of
all
good
the
greeks
made
it
the
seat
of
the
soul
i
have
always
claimed
that
the
most
important
item
in
a
great
poet
biography
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
his
menu
true
a
man
who
eats
a
heavy
beefsteak
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
is
incapable
of
writing
a
sonnet
in
the
afternoon
yes
reginald
added
we
are
what
we
eat
and
what
our
forefathers
have
eaten
before
us
i
ascribe
the
staleness
of
american
poetry
to
the
of
our
puritan
ancestors
i
am
sorry
we
can
not
go
deeper
into
the
subject
at
present
but
i
have
an
invitation
to
dinner
where
i
shall
study
experimentally
the
influence
of
french
sauces
on
my
versification
au
revoir
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
reginald
left
the
room
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
ernest
thoughts
took
a
more
serious
turn
the
tone
of
light
bantering
in
which
the
preceding
conversation
had
taken
place
had
been
assumed
on
his
part
for
the
last
few
weeks
evil
dreams
had
tortured
his
sleep
and
cast
their
shadow
upon
his
waking
hours
they
had
ever
increased
in
reality
in
intensity
and
in
hideousness
even
now
he
could
see
the
long
tapering
fingers
that
every
night
were
groping
in
the
windings
of
his
brain
it
was
a
manicured
hand
that
seemed
to
reach
under
his
skull
carefully
feeling
its
way
through
the
myriad
convolutions
where
thought
resides
and
oh
the
agony
of
it
all
a
human
mind
is
not
a
thing
of
stone
but
alive
horribly
alive
to
pain
what
was
it
those
fingers
sought
what
mysterious
treasures
what
jewels
hidden
in
the
of
his
consciousness
his
brain
was
like
a
human
quaking
under
the
blow
of
the
pick
and
the
tread
of
the
miner
the
miner
ah
the
miner
ceaselessly
thoroughly
relentlessly
he
opened
vein
after
vein
and
wrested
untold
riches
from
the
quivering
ground
but
each
vein
was
a
live
vein
and
each
nugget
of
gold
a
thought
no
wonder
the
boy
was
a
nervous
wreck
whenever
a
tremulous
nascent
idea
was
formulating
itself
the
clutched
it
and
took
it
away
brutally
severing
the
fine
threads
that
bind
thought
to
thought
and
when
the
morning
came
how
his
head
ached
it
was
not
an
acute
pain
but
dull
heavy
incessant
these
sensations
ernest
frequently
told
himself
were
morbid
fancies
but
then
the
monomaniac
who
imagines
that
his
arms
have
been
mangled
or
cut
from
his
body
might
as
well
be
without
arms
mind
can
annihilate
obstacles
it
can
also
create
them
psychology
was
no
unfamiliar
ground
to
ernest
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
seek
in
some
casual
suggestion
an
explanation
for
his
delusion
the
fixed
notion
that
haunted
him
day
and
night
but
he
also
realized
that
to
explain
a
phenomenon
is
not
to
explain
it
away
the
man
who
analyses
his
emotions
can
not
wholly
escape
them
and
the
shadow
of
fear
primal
inexplicable
fear
may
darken
at
moments
of
weakness
the
life
of
the
subtlest
psychologist
and
the
clearest
thinker
he
had
never
spoken
to
reginald
of
his
terrible
nightmares
coming
on
the
heel
of
the
fancy
that
he
ernest
had
written
the
princess
with
the
yellow
veil
a
fancy
that
by
the
way
had
again
possessed
him
of
late
this
new
delusion
would
certainly
arouse
suspicion
as
to
his
sanity
in
reginald
mind
he
would
probably
send
him
to
a
sanitarium
he
certainly
would
not
keep
him
in
the
house
beneficence
itself
in
all
other
things
his
host
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
in
any
matter
that
interfered
with
his
work
he
would
act
swiftly
and
without
mercy
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
ernest
thought
of
abel
felton
poor
boy
what
had
become
of
him
after
he
had
been
turned
from
the
house
he
would
not
wait
for
any
one
to
tell
him
to
pack
his
bundle
but
then
that
was
impossible
reginald
was
fond
of
him
suddenly
ernest
meditations
were
interrupted
by
a
noise
at
the
outer
door
a
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
it
must
be
he
but
why
so
soon
what
could
have
brought
him
back
at
this
hour
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
hall
to
see
what
had
happened
the
figure
that
he
beheld
was
certainly
not
the
person
expected
but
a
woman
from
whose
shoulders
a
fell
in
graceful
folds
probably
a
visitor
for
reginald
ernest
was
about
to
withdraw
discreetly
when
the
electric
light
that
was
burning
in
the
hallway
fell
upon
her
face
and
illumined
it
then
indeed
surprise
overcame
him
ethel
he
cried
is
it
you
xxiii
ernest
conducted
ethel
brandenbourg
to
his
room
and
helped
her
to
remove
her
cloak
while
he
was
placing
the
garment
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
she
slipped
a
little
key
into
her
he
looked
at
her
with
a
question
in
his
eyes
yes
she
replied
i
kept
the
key
but
i
had
not
dreamed
that
i
would
ever
again
cross
this
threshold
meanwhile
it
had
grown
quite
dark
the
reflection
of
the
street
lanterns
without
dimly
lit
the
room
and
through
the
twilight
fantastic
shadows
seemed
to
dance
the
perfume
of
her
hair
pervaded
the
room
and
filled
the
boy
heart
with
romance
tenderness
long
suppressed
called
with
a
thousand
voices
the
hour
the
strangeness
and
unexpectedness
of
her
visit
perhaps
even
a
boy
pardonable
vanity
roused
passion
from
its
slumbers
and
once
again
wrought
in
ernest
soul
the
miracle
of
love
his
arm
encircled
her
neck
and
his
lips
stammered
blind
sweet
crazy
and
caressing
things
turn
on
the
light
she
pleaded
you
were
not
always
so
cruel
no
matter
i
have
not
come
to
speak
of
love
why
then
have
you
come
ernest
felt
a
little
awkward
disappointed
as
he
uttered
these
words
what
could
have
induced
her
to
come
to
his
rooms
he
loosened
his
hold
on
her
and
did
as
she
asked
how
pale
she
looked
in
the
light
how
beautiful
surely
she
had
sorrowed
for
him
but
why
had
she
not
answered
his
letter
yes
why
your
letter
she
smiled
a
little
sadly
surely
you
did
not
expect
me
to
answer
that
why
not
he
had
again
approached
her
and
his
lips
were
close
to
hers
why
not
i
have
yearned
for
you
i
love
you
his
breath
intoxicated
her
it
was
like
a
subtle
perfume
still
she
did
not
yield
you
love
me
now
you
did
not
love
me
then
the
music
of
your
words
was
cold
strained
and
superficial
i
shall
not
answer
i
told
myself
in
his
heart
he
has
forgotten
you
i
did
not
then
realise
that
a
dangerous
force
had
possessed
your
life
and
crushed
in
your
mind
every
image
but
its
own
i
do
understand
do
you
think
i
would
have
come
here
if
it
were
a
light
matter
no
i
tell
you
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
you
at
least
as
an
artist
what
do
you
mean
by
that
have
you
done
a
stroke
of
work
since
i
last
saw
you
yes
let
me
see
surely
magazine
articles
and
a
poem
that
is
not
what
i
want
to
know
have
you
accomplished
anything
big
have
you
grown
since
this
summer
how
about
your
novel
i
i
have
almost
finished
it
in
my
mind
but
i
have
found
no
chance
to
begin
with
the
actual
writing
i
was
sick
of
late
very
sick
no
doubt
of
it
his
face
was
pinched
and
pale
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
were
curiously
contorted
like
those
of
a
man
suffering
from
a
painful
internal
disease
tell
me
she
ventured
do
you
ever
miss
anything
do
you
mean
are
there
thieves
thieves
against
thieves
one
can
protect
oneself
he
stared
at
her
wildly
in
anticipation
of
some
dreadful
revelation
his
dream
his
dream
that
hand
could
it
be
more
than
a
dream
god
his
lips
quivered
ethel
observed
his
agitation
and
continued
more
quietly
but
with
the
same
insistence
have
you
ever
had
ideas
plans
that
you
began
without
having
strength
to
complete
them
have
you
had
glimpses
of
vocal
visions
that
seemed
to
vanish
no
sooner
than
seen
did
it
ever
seem
to
you
as
if
some
mysterious
and
superior
will
brutally
interfered
with
the
workings
of
your
brain
did
it
seem
so
to
him
he
himself
could
not
have
stated
more
plainly
the
experience
of
the
last
few
months
each
word
fell
from
her
lips
like
the
blow
of
a
hammer
shivering
he
put
his
arm
around
her
seeking
solace
not
love
this
time
she
did
not
repulse
him
and
trustingly
as
a
child
confides
to
his
mother
he
depicted
to
her
the
suffering
that
harrowed
his
life
and
made
it
a
hell
as
she
listened
indignation
clouded
her
forehead
while
rising
tears
of
anger
and
of
love
weighed
down
her
lashes
she
could
bear
the
pitiful
sight
no
longer
child
she
cried
do
you
know
who
your
tormentor
is
and
like
a
flash
the
truth
passed
from
her
to
him
a
sudden
intimation
told
him
what
her
words
had
still
concealed
do
for
christ
sake
do
not
pronounce
his
name
he
sobbed
do
not
breathe
it
i
could
not
endure
it
i
should
go
mad
xxiv
very
quietly
with
difficulty
restraining
her
own
emotion
so
as
not
to
excite
him
further
ethel
had
related
to
ernest
the
story
of
her
remarkable
interview
with
reginald
clarke
in
the
long
silence
that
ensued
the
wings
of
his
soul
brushed
against
hers
for
the
first
time
and
love
by
a
thousand
tender
chains
of
common
suffering
welded
their
beings
into
one
caressingly
the
ivory
of
her
fingers
passed
through
the
gold
of
his
hair
and
over
his
brow
as
if
to
banish
the
that
stared
at
him
across
the
hideous
spaces
of
the
past
in
a
rush
a
thousand
incidents
came
back
to
him
mute
witnesses
of
a
damning
truth
his
play
the
dreams
that
tormented
him
his
own
inability
to
concentrate
his
mind
upon
his
novel
which
hitherto
he
had
ascribed
to
nervous
disease
all
piling
fact
on
fact
became
one
monstrous
monument
of
reginald
crime
at
last
ernest
understood
the
parting
words
of
abel
felton
and
the
look
in
ethel
eye
on
the
night
when
he
had
first
linked
his
fate
with
the
other
man
walkham
experience
too
and
reginald
remarks
on
the
busts
of
shakespeare
and
balzac
unmistakably
pointed
toward
the
new
and
horrible
spectre
that
ethel
revelation
had
raised
in
place
of
his
host
and
then
again
the
other
reginald
appeared
crowned
with
the
lyric
wreath
from
his
lips
golden
cadences
fell
sweeter
than
the
smell
of
many
flowers
or
the
sound
of
a
silver
bell
he
was
once
more
the
divine
master
whose
godlike
features
bore
no
trace
of
malice
and
who
had
raised
him
to
a
place
very
near
his
heart
no
he
cried
it
is
impossible
it
all
a
dream
a
horrible
nightmare
but
he
has
himself
confessed
it
she
interjected
perhaps
he
has
spoken
in
symbols
we
all
absorb
to
some
extent
other
men
ideas
without
robbing
them
and
wrecking
their
reginald
may
be
unscrupulous
in
the
use
of
his
power
of
impressing
upon
others
the
stamp
of
his
so
was
shakespeare
no
no
no
you
are
mistaken
we
were
both
deluded
for
the
moment
by
his
picturesque
account
of
a
common
not
even
a
discreditable
fact
he
may
himself
have
played
with
the
idea
but
surely
he
can
not
have
been
serious
and
your
own
experience
and
abel
felton
and
mine
can
they
too
be
dismissed
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
but
come
to
think
of
it
the
whole
theory
seems
absurd
it
is
unscientific
it
is
not
even
a
case
of
mesmerism
if
he
had
said
that
he
hypnotised
his
victims
the
matter
would
assume
a
totally
different
aspect
i
admit
that
something
is
wrong
somewhere
and
that
the
home
of
reginald
clarke
is
no
healthful
abode
for
me
but
you
must
also
remember
that
probably
we
are
both
unstrung
to
the
point
of
hysteria
but
to
ethel
his
words
carried
no
conviction
you
are
still
under
his
spell
she
cried
anxiously
a
little
shaken
in
his
confidence
ernest
resumed
reginald
is
utterly
incapable
of
such
an
action
even
granting
that
he
possessed
the
terrible
power
of
which
you
speak
a
man
of
his
splendid
resources
a
literary
midas
at
whose
very
touch
every
word
turns
into
gold
is
under
no
necessity
to
prey
on
the
thoughts
of
others
circumstances
i
admit
are
suspicious
but
in
the
light
of
common
day
this
fanciful
theory
shrivels
into
nothing
any
court
of
law
would
reject
our
evidence
as
madness
it
is
too
utterly
fantastic
utterly
alien
to
any
human
experience
is
it
though
ethel
replied
with
peculiar
intonation
why
what
do
you
mean
surely
she
answered
you
must
know
that
in
the
legends
of
every
nation
we
read
of
men
and
women
who
were
called
vampires
they
are
beings
not
always
wholly
evil
whom
every
night
some
mysterious
impulse
leads
to
steal
into
unguarded
bedchambers
to
suck
the
blood
of
the
sleepers
and
then
having
waxed
strong
on
the
life
of
their
victims
cautiously
to
retreat
thence
comes
it
that
their
lips
are
very
red
it
is
even
said
that
they
can
find
no
rest
in
the
grave
but
return
to
their
former
haunts
long
after
they
are
believed
to
be
dead
those
whom
they
visit
however
pine
away
for
no
apparent
reason
the
physicians
shake
their
wise
heads
and
speak
of
consumption
but
sometimes
ancient
chronicles
assure
us
the
people
suspicions
were
aroused
and
under
the
leadership
of
a
good
priest
they
went
in
solemn
procession
to
the
graves
of
the
persons
suspected
and
on
opening
the
tombs
it
was
found
that
their
coffins
had
rotted
away
and
the
flowers
in
their
hair
were
black
but
their
bodies
were
white
and
whole
through
no
empty
sockets
crept
the
vermin
and
their
sucking
lips
were
still
moist
with
a
little
blood
ernest
was
carried
away
in
spite
of
himself
by
her
account
which
vividly
resembled
his
own
experience
still
he
would
not
give
in
all
this
is
impressive
i
admit
it
is
very
impressive
but
you
yourself
speak
of
such
stories
as
legends
they
are
unfounded
upon
any
tangible
fact
and
you
can
not
expect
a
man
schooled
in
modern
sciences
to
admit
as
having
any
possible
bearing
upon
his
life
the
crude
belief
of
the
middle
ages
why
not
she
responded
our
scientists
have
proved
true
the
wildest
theories
of
mediæval
scholars
the
transmutation
of
metals
seems
no
longer
an
idle
speculation
and
radium
has
transformed
into
potential
reality
the
dream
of
perpetual
motion
the
fundamental
notions
of
mathematics
are
being
undermined
one
school
of
philosophers
claims
that
the
number
of
angles
in
a
triangle
is
equal
to
more
than
two
right
angles
another
propounds
that
it
is
less
even
great
scientists
who
have
studied
the
soul
of
nature
are
turning
to
spiritism
the
world
is
overcoming
the
shallow
scepticism
of
the
nineteenth
century
life
has
become
once
more
wonderful
and
very
mysterious
but
it
also
seems
that
with
the
miracles
of
the
old
days
their
terrors
their
nightmares
and
their
monsters
have
come
back
in
a
modern
guise
ernest
became
even
more
thoughtful
yes
he
observed
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
then
pacing
the
room
nervously
he
exclaimed
and
still
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
your
explanation
reginald
a
vampire
it
seems
so
ludicrous
if
you
had
told
me
that
such
creatures
exist
somewhere
far
away
i
might
have
discussed
the
matter
but
in
this
great
city
in
the
shadow
of
the
flatiron
building
no
she
replied
with
warmth
yet
they
exist
always
have
existed
not
only
in
the
middle
ages
but
at
all
times
and
in
all
regions
there
is
no
nation
but
has
some
record
of
them
in
one
form
or
another
and
you
think
if
we
find
a
thought
no
matter
how
absurd
it
may
seem
to
us
that
has
ever
occupied
the
minds
of
men
if
we
find
i
say
such
a
perennially
recurrent
thought
are
we
not
justified
in
assuming
that
it
must
have
some
basis
in
the
actual
experience
of
mankind
ernest
brow
became
very
clouded
and
infinite
numbers
of
hidden
premature
wrinkles
began
to
show
how
wan
he
looked
and
how
frail
he
was
as
one
lost
in
a
labyrinth
in
which
he
saw
no
light
convinced
against
his
will
or
rather
against
his
scientific
conviction
that
she
was
not
wholly
mistaken
still
he
observed
triumphantly
your
vampires
suck
blood
but
reginald
if
vampire
he
be
preys
upon
the
soul
how
can
a
man
suck
from
another
man
brain
a
thing
as
intangible
as
quintessential
as
thought
ah
she
replied
you
forget
thought
is
more
real
than
blood
xxv
only
three
hours
had
passed
since
ethel
had
startled
ernest
from
his
sombre
reveries
but
within
this
brief
space
their
love
had
matured
as
if
each
hour
had
been
a
year
the
pallor
had
vanished
from
his
cheeks
and
the
restiveness
from
his
eyes
the
intoxication
of
her
presence
had
rekindled
the
light
of
his
countenance
and
given
him
strength
to
combat
the
mighty
forces
embodied
in
reginald
clarke
the
child
in
him
had
made
room
for
the
man
he
would
not
hear
of
surrendering
without
a
struggle
and
ethel
felt
sure
she
might
leave
his
fate
in
his
own
hand
love
had
lent
him
a
coat
of
mail
he
was
warned
and
would
not
succumb
still
she
made
one
more
attempt
to
persuade
him
to
leave
the
house
at
once
with
her
i
must
go
now
she
said
will
you
not
come
with
me
after
all
i
am
so
afraid
to
think
of
you
still
here
no
dear
he
replied
i
shall
not
desert
my
post
i
must
solve
the
riddle
of
this
man
life
and
if
indeed
he
is
the
thing
he
seems
to
be
i
shall
attempt
to
wrest
from
him
what
he
has
stolen
from
me
i
speak
of
my
unwritten
novel
do
not
attempt
to
oppose
him
openly
you
can
not
resist
him
be
assured
that
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
i
have
in
the
last
few
hours
lived
through
so
much
that
makes
life
worth
living
that
i
would
not
wantonly
expose
myself
to
any
danger
still
i
can
not
go
without
certainty
can
not
if
there
is
some
truth
in
our
fears
leave
the
best
of
me
behind
what
are
you
planning
to
do
my
play
i
am
sure
now
that
it
is
mine
i
can
not
take
from
him
that
is
irretrievably
lost
he
has
read
it
to
his
circle
and
prepared
for
its
publication
and
no
matter
how
firmly
convinced
you
or
i
may
be
of
his
strange
power
no
one
would
believe
our
testimony
they
would
pronounce
us
mad
perhaps
we
mad
no
we
are
not
mad
but
it
is
mad
for
you
to
stay
here
she
asserted
i
shall
not
stay
here
one
minute
longer
than
is
absolutely
essential
within
a
week
i
shall
have
conclusive
proof
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
how
will
you
go
about
it
his
writing
table
ah
yes
perhaps
i
can
discover
some
note
some
indication
some
proof
it
a
dangerous
game
i
have
everything
to
gain
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
with
you
she
said
have
you
no
friend
no
one
whom
you
could
trust
in
this
delicate
matter
why
yes
jack
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
do
you
know
she
said
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
care
more
for
him
than
for
me
nonsense
he
said
he
is
my
friend
you
you
immeasurably
more
are
you
still
as
intimate
with
him
as
when
i
first
met
you
not
quite
of
late
a
troubling
something
like
a
thin
veil
seems
to
have
passed
between
us
but
he
will
come
when
i
call
him
he
will
not
fail
me
in
my
hour
of
need
when
can
he
be
here
in
two
or
three
days
meanwhile
be
very
careful
above
all
lock
your
door
at
night
i
will
not
only
lock
but
barricade
it
i
shall
try
with
all
my
power
to
elucidate
this
mystery
without
however
exposing
myself
to
needless
risks
i
will
go
then
kiss
me
may
i
not
take
you
to
the
car
you
had
better
not
at
the
door
she
turned
back
once
more
write
me
every
day
or
call
me
up
on
the
telephone
he
straightened
himself
as
if
to
convince
her
of
his
strength
yet
when
at
last
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
his
courage
forsook
him
for
a
moment
and
if
he
had
not
been
ashamed
to
appear
a
weakling
before
the
woman
he
loved
who
knows
if
any
power
on
earth
could
have
kept
him
in
that
house
where
from
every
corner
a
secret
seemed
to
lurk
there
was
a
misgiving
too
in
the
woman
heart
as
she
left
the
boy
behind
a
prey
to
the
occult
power
that
seeking
expression
in
multiple
activities
has
made
and
unmade
emperors
prophets
and
poets
as
she
stepped
into
a
street
car
she
saw
from
afar
as
in
a
vision
the
face
of
reginald
clarke
it
seemed
very
white
and
hungry
there
was
no
human
kindness
in
it
only
a
threat
and
a
sneer
xxvi
for
over
an
hour
ernest
paced
up
and
down
his
room
wildly
excited
by
ethel
revelations
it
required
an
immense
amount
of
for
him
to
pen
the
following
lines
to
jack
i
need
you
come
after
he
had
entrusted
the
letter
to
the
a
reaction
set
in
and
he
was
able
to
consider
the
matter
if
not
with
equanimity
at
least
with
a
degree
of
calmness
the
strangest
thing
to
him
was
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
hate
reginald
of
whose
evil
influence
upon
his
life
he
was
now
firmly
convinced
here
was
another
shattered
idol
but
one
like
the
fragment
of
a
great
in
the
desert
intensely
fascinating
even
in
its
ruin
then
yielding
to
a
natural
impulse
ernest
looked
over
his
photographs
and
at
once
laid
hold
upon
the
austere
image
of
his
master
and
friend
no
it
was
preposterous
there
was
no
evil
in
this
man
there
was
no
trace
of
malice
in
this
face
the
face
of
a
prophet
or
an
inspired
madman
a
poet
and
yet
as
he
scrutinised
the
picture
closely
a
curious
transformation
seemed
to
take
place
in
the
features
a
sly
little
line
appeared
insinuatingly
about
reginald
mouth
and
the
serene
calm
of
his
seemed
to
turn
into
the
sneak
smile
of
a
thief
nevertheless
ernest
was
not
afraid
his
anxieties
had
at
last
assumed
definite
shape
it
was
possible
now
to
be
on
his
guard
it
is
only
invisible
incomprehensible
fear
crouching
upon
us
from
the
night
that
drives
sensitive
natures
to
the
verge
of
madness
and
transforms
stern
warriors
into
cowards
ernest
realised
the
necessity
of
postponing
the
proposed
investigation
of
reginald
papers
until
the
morning
as
it
was
now
near
eleven
and
he
expected
to
hear
at
any
moment
the
sound
of
his
feet
at
the
door
before
retiring
he
took
a
number
of
precautions
carefully
he
locked
the
door
to
his
bedroom
and
placed
a
chair
in
front
of
it
to
make
doubly
sure
he
fastened
the
handle
to
an
exquisite
chinese
vase
a
gift
of
reginald
that
at
the
least
attempt
to
force
an
entrance
from
without
would
come
down
with
a
crash
then
although
sleep
seemed
out
of
the
question
he
went
to
bed
he
had
hardly
touched
the
pillow
when
a
leaden
weight
seemed
to
fall
upon
his
eyes
the
day
commotion
had
been
too
much
for
his
delicate
frame
by
force
of
habit
he
pulled
the
cover
over
his
ear
and
fell
asleep
all
night
he
slept
heavily
and
the
morning
was
far
advanced
when
a
knock
at
the
door
that
at
first
seemed
to
come
across
an
immeasurable
distance
brought
him
back
to
himself
it
was
reginald
manservant
announcing
that
breakfast
was
waiting
ernest
got
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
the
barricade
at
the
door
at
once
brought
back
to
his
mind
with
startling
clearness
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
everything
was
as
he
had
left
it
evidently
no
one
had
attempted
to
enter
the
room
while
he
slept
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
arrangement
which
reminded
him
of
his
childhood
when
he
had
sought
by
similar
means
security
from
burglars
and
bogeys
and
in
the
broad
daylight
ethel
tales
of
vampires
seemed
once
more
impossible
and
absurd
still
he
had
abundant
evidence
of
reginald
strange
influence
and
was
determined
to
know
the
truth
before
nightfall
her
words
that
thought
is
more
real
than
blood
kept
ringing
in
his
ears
if
such
was
the
case
he
would
find
evidence
of
reginald
intellectual
burglaries
and
possibly
be
able
to
regain
a
part
of
his
lost
self
that
had
been
snatched
from
him
by
the
relentless
but
under
no
circumstances
could
he
face
reginald
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
was
convinced
that
if
in
the
fleeting
vision
of
a
moment
the
other
man
true
nature
should
reveal
itself
to
him
he
would
be
so
terribly
afraid
as
to
shriek
like
a
maniac
so
he
dressed
particularly
slowly
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
an
encounter
with
his
host
but
fate
thwarted
this
hope
reginald
too
lingered
that
morning
unusually
long
over
his
coffee
he
was
just
taking
his
last
sip
when
ernest
entered
the
room
his
behaviour
was
of
an
almost
bourgeois
kindness
benevolence
fairly
beamed
from
his
face
but
to
the
boy
eyes
it
had
assumed
a
new
and
sinister
expression
you
are
late
this
morning
ernest
he
remarked
in
his
mildest
manner
have
you
been
about
town
or
writing
poetry
both
occupations
are
equally
unhealthy
as
he
said
this
he
watched
the
young
man
with
the
inscrutable
smile
that
at
moments
was
wont
to
curl
upon
his
lips
ernest
had
once
likened
it
to
the
smile
of
mona
lisa
but
now
he
detected
in
it
the
suavity
of
the
hypocrite
and
the
leer
of
the
criminal
he
could
not
endure
it
he
could
not
look
upon
that
face
any
longer
his
feet
almost
gave
way
under
him
cold
sweat
gathered
on
his
brow
and
he
sank
on
a
chair
trembling
and
studiously
avoiding
the
other
man
gaze
at
last
reginald
rose
to
go
it
seemed
impossible
to
accuse
this
splendid
impersonation
of
vigorous
manhood
of
cunning
and
underhand
methods
of
plagiarisms
and
of
theft
as
he
stood
there
he
resembled
more
than
anything
a
beautiful
a
wonderful
thing
of
strength
and
indomitable
and
insatiate
yet
who
could
tell
whether
this
strength
was
not
after
all
parasitic
if
ethel
suspicions
were
justified
then
indeed
more
had
been
taken
from
him
than
he
could
ever
realise
for
in
that
case
it
was
his
that
circled
in
those
veins
and
the
fire
of
his
intellect
that
set
those
lips
aflame
xxvii
reginald
clarke
had
hardly
left
the
room
when
ernest
hastily
rose
from
his
seat
while
it
was
likely
that
he
would
remain
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
apartment
the
whole
morning
the
stake
at
hand
was
too
great
to
permit
of
delay
palpitating
and
a
little
uncertain
he
entered
the
studio
where
scarcely
a
year
ago
reginald
clarke
had
bidden
him
welcome
nothing
had
changed
there
since
then
only
in
ernest
mind
the
room
had
assumed
an
aspect
of
evil
the
antinous
was
there
and
the
faun
and
the
but
their
juxtaposition
partook
of
the
nature
of
the
blasphemous
the
statues
of
shakespeare
and
balzac
seemed
to
frown
from
their
pedestals
as
his
fingers
were
running
through
reginald
papers
he
brushed
against
a
semblance
of
napoleon
that
was
standing
on
the
so
that
it
toppled
over
and
made
a
noise
that
weirdly
in
the
silence
of
the
room
at
that
moment
a
curious
family
resemblance
between
shakespeare
balzac
napoleon
and
reginald
forcibly
impressed
itself
upon
his
mind
it
was
the
indisputable
something
that
marks
those
who
are
chosen
to
give
ultimate
expression
to
some
gigantic
in
balzac
face
it
was
diffused
with
kindliness
in
that
of
napoleon
sheer
brutality
predominated
the
image
of
one
who
was
said
to
be
the
richest
man
of
the
world
also
rose
before
his
eyes
perhaps
it
was
only
the
play
of
his
fevered
imagination
but
he
could
have
sworn
that
this
man
features
too
bore
the
mark
of
those
unoriginal
great
absorptive
minds
who
for
better
or
for
worse
are
born
to
rob
and
rule
they
seemed
to
him
monsters
that
know
neither
justice
nor
pity
only
the
law
of
their
being
the
law
of
growth
common
weapons
would
not
avail
against
such
forces
being
one
they
were
stronger
than
armies
nor
could
they
be
overcome
in
single
combat
stealth
trickery
the
outfit
of
the
knave
were
legitimate
weapons
in
such
a
fight
in
this
case
the
end
justified
the
means
even
if
the
latter
included
burglary
after
a
brief
and
fruitless
search
of
the
desk
he
attempted
to
force
open
a
secret
drawer
the
presence
of
which
he
had
one
day
accidentally
discovered
he
tried
a
number
of
keys
to
no
account
and
was
thinking
of
giving
up
his
researches
for
the
day
until
he
had
procured
a
skeleton
key
when
at
last
the
lock
gave
way
the
drawer
disclosed
a
large
file
of
manuscript
ernest
paused
for
a
moment
to
draw
breath
the
paper
rustled
under
his
nervous
fingers
and
there
at
last
his
eyes
lit
upon
a
bulky
bundle
that
bore
this
legend
a
novel
it
was
true
then
all
his
dream
reginald
confession
and
the
house
that
had
opened
its
doors
so
kindly
to
him
was
the
house
of
a
vampire
finally
curiosity
overcame
his
burning
indignation
he
attempted
to
read
the
letters
seemed
to
dance
before
his
eyes
his
hands
trembled
at
last
he
succeeded
the
words
that
had
first
rolled
over
like
drunken
soldiers
now
marched
before
his
vision
in
orderly
sequence
he
was
delighted
then
stunned
this
was
indeed
authentic
literature
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
and
it
was
his
he
was
still
a
poet
a
great
poet
he
drew
a
deep
breath
sudden
joy
trembled
in
his
heart
this
story
set
down
by
a
foreign
hand
had
grown
chapter
by
chapter
in
his
brain
there
were
some
slight
changes
slight
deviations
from
the
original
plan
a
defter
hand
than
his
had
retouched
it
here
and
there
but
for
all
that
it
remained
his
very
own
it
did
not
belong
to
that
thief
the
blood
welled
to
his
cheek
as
he
uttered
this
word
that
applied
to
reginald
seemed
almost
sacrilegious
he
had
nearly
reached
the
last
chapter
when
he
heard
steps
in
the
hallway
hurriedly
he
restored
the
manuscript
to
its
place
closed
the
drawer
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
it
was
reginald
but
he
did
not
come
alone
someone
was
speaking
to
him
the
voice
seemed
familiar
ernest
could
not
make
out
what
it
said
he
listened
intently
and
was
it
possible
jack
surely
he
could
not
yet
have
come
in
response
to
his
note
what
mysterious
power
what
dim
presentiment
of
his
friend
plight
had
led
him
hither
but
why
did
he
linger
so
long
in
reginald
room
instead
of
hastening
to
greet
him
cautiously
he
drew
nearer
this
time
he
caught
jack
words
it
would
be
very
convenient
and
pleasant
still
some
way
i
feel
that
it
is
not
right
for
me
of
all
men
to
take
his
place
here
that
need
not
concern
you
reginald
deliberately
replied
the
dear
boy
expressed
the
desire
to
leave
me
within
a
fortnight
i
think
he
will
go
to
some
private
sanitarium
his
nerves
are
frightfully
overstrained
this
seems
hardly
surprising
after
the
terrible
attack
he
had
when
you
read
your
play
that
idea
has
since
then
developed
into
a
monomania
i
am
awfully
sorry
for
him
i
cared
for
him
much
perhaps
too
much
but
i
always
feared
that
he
would
come
to
such
an
end
of
late
his
letters
have
been
strangely
unbalanced
you
will
find
him
very
much
changed
in
fact
he
is
no
longer
the
same
no
said
jack
he
is
no
longer
the
friend
i
loved
ernest
clutched
for
the
wall
his
face
was
contorted
with
intense
agony
each
word
was
like
a
nail
driven
into
his
flesh
crucified
upon
the
cross
of
his
own
affection
by
the
hand
he
loved
all
white
and
trembling
he
stood
there
tears
rushed
to
his
eyes
but
he
could
not
weep
he
reached
his
room
and
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
thus
he
lay
uncomforted
and
alone
xxviii
terrible
as
was
his
loneliness
a
meeting
with
jack
would
have
been
more
terrible
and
after
all
it
was
true
a
gulf
had
opened
between
them
ethel
alone
could
bring
solace
to
his
soul
there
was
a
great
void
in
his
heart
which
only
she
could
fill
he
hungered
for
the
touch
of
her
hand
he
longed
for
her
presence
strongly
as
a
wanton
lusts
for
pleasure
and
as
sad
men
crave
death
noiselessly
he
stole
to
the
door
so
as
not
to
arouse
the
attention
of
the
other
two
men
whose
every
whisper
pierced
his
heart
like
a
dagger
when
he
came
to
ethel
home
he
found
that
she
had
gone
out
for
a
breath
of
air
the
servant
ushered
him
into
the
parlor
and
there
he
waited
waited
waited
for
her
greatly
calmed
by
his
walk
he
turned
the
details
of
conversation
over
in
his
mind
and
the
conviction
grew
upon
him
that
the
friend
of
his
boyhood
was
not
to
blame
for
his
course
of
action
reginald
probably
had
encircled
jack
soul
with
his
demoniacal
influence
and
singled
him
out
for
another
victim
that
must
never
be
it
was
his
turn
to
save
now
he
would
warn
his
friend
of
the
danger
that
threatened
him
even
if
his
words
should
be
spoken
into
the
wind
for
reginald
with
an
ingenuity
almost
satanic
had
already
suggested
that
the
delusion
of
former
days
had
developed
into
a
monomania
and
any
attempt
on
his
part
to
warn
jack
would
only
seem
to
confirm
this
theory
in
that
case
only
one
way
was
left
open
he
must
plead
with
reginald
himself
confront
at
all
risks
that
snatcher
of
souls
he
would
not
fall
asleep
he
would
keep
his
vigil
and
if
reginald
should
approach
his
room
if
in
some
way
he
felt
the
direful
presence
he
must
speak
out
threaten
if
need
be
to
save
his
friend
from
ruin
he
had
fully
determined
upon
this
course
when
a
cry
of
joy
from
ethel
who
had
just
returned
from
her
walk
interrupted
his
reverie
but
her
gladness
changed
to
anxiety
when
she
saw
how
pale
he
was
ernest
recounted
to
her
the
happenings
of
the
day
from
the
discovery
of
his
novel
in
reginald
desk
to
the
conversation
which
he
had
accidentally
overheard
he
noticed
that
her
features
brightened
as
he
drew
near
the
end
of
his
tale
was
your
novel
finished
she
suddenly
asked
i
think
so
then
you
are
out
of
danger
he
will
want
nothing
else
of
you
but
you
should
have
taken
it
with
you
i
had
only
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
slip
it
back
into
the
drawer
i
shall
simply
demand
it
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
in
his
handwriting
and
you
have
no
legal
proof
that
it
is
yours
you
must
take
it
away
secretly
and
he
will
not
dare
to
reclaim
it
and
jack
she
had
quite
forgotten
jack
women
are
invariably
selfish
for
those
they
love
you
must
warn
him
she
replied
he
would
laugh
at
me
however
i
must
speak
to
reginald
it
is
of
no
avail
to
speak
to
him
at
least
you
must
not
do
so
before
you
have
obtained
the
manuscript
it
would
unnecessarily
jeopardise
our
plans
and
after
after
perhaps
but
you
must
not
expose
yourself
to
any
danger
no
dear
he
said
and
kissed
her
what
danger
is
there
provided
i
keep
my
wits
about
me
he
steals
upon
men
only
in
their
sleep
and
in
the
dark
be
careful
nevertheless
i
shall
in
fact
i
think
he
is
not
at
home
at
this
moment
if
i
go
now
i
may
be
able
to
get
hold
of
the
manuscript
and
hide
it
before
he
returns
i
can
not
but
tremble
to
think
of
you
in
that
house
you
shall
have
no
more
reason
to
tremble
in
a
day
or
two
shall
i
see
you
i
do
think
so
i
must
go
over
my
papers
and
things
so
as
to
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
leave
the
house
and
then
then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
looked
long
and
deeply
into
her
eyes
yes
she
replied
at
least
perhaps
then
he
turned
to
go
resolute
and
happy
how
strangely
he
had
matured
since
the
summer
her
heart
swelled
with
the
consciousness
that
it
was
her
love
that
had
effected
this
transformation
as
i
can
not
expect
you
i
shall
probably
go
to
the
opera
but
i
shall
be
at
home
before
midnight
will
you
call
me
up
then
a
word
from
you
will
put
me
at
ease
for
the
night
even
if
it
comes
over
the
telephone
i
will
call
you
up
we
moderns
have
an
advantage
over
the
ancients
in
this
respect
the
pyramus
can
speak
to
thisbe
even
if
innumerable
walls
sever
his
body
from
hers
a
quaint
conceit
but
let
us
hope
that
our
will
end
less
tragically
she
said
tenderly
caressing
his
hair
oh
we
shall
be
happy
you
and
i
she
added
after
a
while
the
iron
finger
of
fate
that
lay
so
heavily
on
our
lives
is
now
withdrawn
almost
withdrawn
yes
almost
only
almost
and
then
a
sudden
fear
overcame
her
no
she
cried
do
not
go
do
not
go
stay
with
me
stay
here
i
feel
so
frightened
i
do
know
what
comes
over
me
i
am
afraid
afraid
for
you
no
dear
he
rejoined
you
need
not
be
afraid
in
your
heart
you
do
want
me
to
desert
a
friend
and
besides
leave
the
best
part
of
my
artistic
life
in
reginald
clutch
why
should
you
expose
yourself
to
god
knows
what
danger
for
a
friend
who
is
ready
to
betray
you
you
forget
friendship
is
a
gift
if
it
exacts
payment
in
any
form
it
is
no
longer
either
friendship
or
a
gift
and
you
yourself
have
assured
me
that
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
reginald
i
have
nothing
to
give
to
him
she
rallied
under
his
words
and
had
regained
her
when
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
walked
a
few
blocks
very
briskly
then
his
pace
slackened
her
words
had
unsettled
him
a
little
and
when
he
reached
home
he
did
not
at
once
resume
his
exploration
of
papers
he
had
hardly
lit
a
cigarette
when
at
an
unusually
early
hour
he
heard
reginald
key
in
the
lock
quickly
he
turned
the
light
out
and
in
the
lit
up
by
an
electric
lantern
below
barricaded
the
door
as
on
the
previous
night
then
he
went
to
bed
without
finding
sleep
supreme
silence
reigned
over
the
house
even
the
elevator
had
ceased
to
run
ernest
brain
was
all
ear
he
heard
reginald
walking
up
and
down
in
the
studio
not
the
smallest
movement
escaped
his
attention
thus
hours
passed
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
he
was
still
walking
up
and
down
down
and
up
up
and
down
one
still
the
measured
beat
of
his
footfall
had
not
ceased
there
was
something
hypnotic
in
the
regular
tread
nature
at
last
exacted
its
toll
from
the
boy
he
fell
asleep
hardly
had
he
closed
his
eyes
when
again
that
horrible
nightmare
no
longer
a
nightmare
tormented
him
again
he
felt
the
pointed
delicate
fingers
carefully
feeling
their
way
along
the
innumerable
tangled
threads
of
that
lead
to
the
innermost
recesses
of
self
a
subconscious
something
strove
to
arouse
him
and
he
felt
the
fingers
softly
withdrawn
he
could
have
sworn
that
he
heard
the
scurrying
of
feet
in
the
room
bathed
in
perspiration
he
made
a
leap
for
the
electric
light
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
human
presence
the
barricade
at
the
door
was
undisturbed
but
fear
like
a
great
wind
filled
the
wings
of
his
soul
yet
there
was
nothing
nothing
to
warrant
his
conviction
that
reginald
clarke
had
been
with
him
only
a
few
moments
ago
plying
his
horrible
trade
the
large
mirror
above
the
fireplace
only
showed
him
his
own
face
white
excited
the
face
of
a
madman
xxix
the
next
morning
mail
brought
a
letter
from
ethel
a
few
lines
of
encouragement
and
affection
yes
she
was
right
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
stay
under
one
roof
with
reginald
any
longer
he
must
only
obtain
the
manuscript
and
if
possible
surprise
him
in
the
attempt
to
exercise
his
mysterious
and
criminal
power
then
he
would
be
in
the
position
to
dictate
terms
and
to
demand
jack
safety
as
the
price
of
his
silence
reginald
however
had
closeted
himself
that
day
in
his
studio
busily
writing
only
the
clatter
of
his
typewriter
announced
his
presence
in
the
house
there
was
no
chance
for
conversation
or
for
obtaining
the
precious
manuscript
of
leontina
meanwhile
ernest
was
looking
over
his
papers
and
preparing
everything
for
a
quick
departure
glancing
over
old
letters
and
notes
he
became
readily
interested
and
hardly
noticed
the
passage
of
the
hours
when
the
night
came
he
only
partly
undressed
and
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
it
was
now
ten
at
twelve
he
had
promised
ethel
to
speak
to
her
over
the
telephone
he
was
determined
not
to
sleep
at
all
that
night
at
last
he
would
discover
whether
or
not
on
the
previous
and
other
nights
reginald
had
secretly
entered
his
room
when
one
hour
had
passed
without
incident
his
attention
relaxed
a
little
his
eyes
were
gradually
closing
when
suddenly
something
seemed
to
stir
at
the
door
the
chinese
vase
came
rattling
to
the
floor
at
once
ernest
sprang
up
his
face
had
blanched
with
terror
it
was
whiter
than
the
linen
in
which
they
wrap
the
dead
but
his
soul
was
resolute
he
touched
a
button
and
the
electric
light
illuminated
the
whole
chamber
there
was
no
nook
for
even
a
shadow
to
hide
yet
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
from
without
the
door
came
no
sound
suddenly
something
soft
touched
his
foot
he
gathered
all
his
will
power
so
as
not
to
break
out
into
a
frenzied
shriek
then
he
laughed
not
a
hearty
laugh
to
be
sure
a
tiny
nose
and
a
tail
gracefully
curled
were
brushing
against
him
the
source
of
the
disturbance
was
a
little
maltese
cat
his
favourite
that
by
some
chance
had
remained
in
his
room
after
its
essay
at
midnight
gymnastics
the
animal
quieted
down
and
lay
purring
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
the
presence
of
a
living
thing
was
a
certain
comfort
and
the
reservoir
of
his
strength
was
well
nigh
exhausted
he
dimly
remembered
his
promise
to
ethel
but
his
lids
drooped
with
sheer
weariness
perhaps
an
hour
passed
in
this
way
when
suddenly
his
blood
congealed
with
dread
he
felt
the
presence
of
the
hand
of
reginald
clarke
unmistakably
groping
in
his
brain
as
if
searching
for
something
that
had
still
escaped
him
he
tried
to
move
to
cry
out
but
his
limbs
were
paralysed
when
by
a
superhuman
effort
he
at
last
succeeded
in
shaking
off
the
numbness
that
held
him
enchained
he
awoke
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
that
of
a
man
disappearing
in
the
wall
that
separated
reginald
apartments
from
his
room
this
time
it
was
no
delusion
of
the
senses
he
heard
something
like
a
secret
door
softly
closing
behind
retreating
steps
a
sudden
fierce
anger
seized
him
he
was
oblivious
of
the
danger
of
the
terrible
power
of
the
older
man
oblivious
of
the
love
he
had
once
borne
him
oblivious
of
everything
save
the
sense
of
outraged
humanity
and
outraged
right
the
law
permits
us
to
shoot
a
burglar
who
goes
through
our
pockets
at
night
must
he
tolerate
the
ravages
of
this
a
thousand
times
more
dastardly
and
dangerous
spiritual
thief
was
reginald
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
other
men
labour
unpunished
was
he
to
continue
growing
into
the
mightiest
literary
factor
of
the
century
by
preying
upon
his
betters
abel
walkham
ethel
he
jack
were
they
all
to
be
victims
of
this
insatiable
monster
was
this
force
resistless
as
it
was
relentless
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
dashed
himself
against
the
wall
at
the
place
where
the
shadow
of
reginald
clarke
had
disappeared
in
doing
so
he
touched
upon
a
secret
spring
the
wall
gave
way
noiselessly
speechless
with
rage
he
crossed
the
next
room
and
the
one
adjoining
it
and
stood
in
reginald
studio
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
reginald
still
dressed
was
seated
at
his
scribbling
notes
upon
little
scraps
of
paper
in
his
accustomed
manner
at
ernest
approach
he
looked
up
without
evincing
the
least
sign
of
terror
or
surprise
calmly
almost
majestically
he
folded
his
arms
over
his
breast
but
there
was
a
menacing
glitter
in
his
eyes
as
he
confronted
his
victim
xxx
silently
the
two
men
faced
each
other
then
ernest
hissed
thief
reginald
shrugged
his
shoulders
vampire
so
ethel
has
infected
you
with
her
absurd
fancies
poor
boy
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
for
some
time
but
i
think
we
have
reached
the
parting
of
our
road
and
that
you
dare
to
tell
me
the
more
he
raged
the
calmer
reginald
seemed
to
become
really
he
said
i
fail
to
understand
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
my
room
you
fail
to
understand
you
cad
ernest
cried
he
stepped
to
the
and
opened
the
secret
drawer
with
a
blow
a
bundle
of
manuscripts
fell
on
the
floor
with
a
strange
rustling
noise
then
seizing
his
own
story
he
hurled
it
upon
the
table
and
behold
the
last
pages
bore
corrections
in
ink
that
could
have
been
made
only
a
few
minutes
ago
reginald
smiled
have
you
come
to
play
havoc
with
my
manuscripts
he
remarked
your
manuscripts
reginald
clarke
you
are
an
impudent
impostor
you
have
written
no
word
that
is
your
own
you
are
an
embezzler
of
the
mind
strutting
through
life
in
borrowed
and
stolen
plumes
and
at
once
the
mask
fell
from
reginald
face
why
stolen
he
coolly
said
with
a
slight
touch
of
irritation
i
absorb
i
appropriate
that
is
the
most
any
artist
can
say
for
himself
god
creates
man
moulds
he
gives
us
the
colours
we
mix
them
that
is
not
the
question
i
charge
you
with
having
wilfully
and
criminally
interfered
in
my
life
i
charge
you
with
having
robbed
me
of
what
was
mine
i
charge
you
with
being
utterly
vile
and
rapacious
a
hypocrite
and
a
parasite
foolish
boy
reginald
rejoined
austerely
it
is
through
me
that
the
best
in
you
shall
survive
even
as
the
obscure
elizabethans
live
in
him
of
avon
shakespeare
absorbed
what
was
great
in
little
men
a
greatness
that
otherwise
would
have
perished
and
gave
it
a
setting
a
life
a
thief
may
plead
the
same
i
understand
you
better
it
is
your
inordinate
vanity
that
prompts
you
to
abuse
your
monstrous
power
you
err
has
never
entered
into
my
actions
i
am
careless
of
personal
fame
look
at
me
boy
as
i
stand
before
you
i
am
homer
i
am
shakespeare
i
am
every
cosmic
manifestation
in
art
men
have
doubted
in
each
incarnation
my
individual
existence
historians
have
more
to
tell
of
the
meanest
athenian
scribbler
or
elizabethan
poetaster
than
of
me
the
radiance
of
my
work
obscured
my
very
self
i
care
not
i
have
a
mission
i
am
a
servant
of
the
lord
i
am
the
vessel
that
bears
the
host
he
stood
up
at
full
length
the
personification
of
grandeur
and
power
a
tremendous
force
trembled
in
his
very
finger
tips
he
was
like
a
gigantic
dynamo
charged
with
the
might
of
ten
thousand
magnetic
storms
that
shake
the
earth
in
its
orbit
and
lash
myriads
of
planets
through
infinities
of
space
under
ordinary
circumstances
ernest
or
any
other
man
would
have
quailed
before
him
but
the
boy
in
that
epic
moment
had
grown
out
of
his
stature
he
felt
the
sword
of
vengeance
in
his
hands
to
him
was
intrusted
the
cause
of
abel
and
of
walkham
of
ethel
and
of
jack
his
was
the
struggle
of
the
individual
soul
against
the
same
blind
and
cruel
fate
that
in
the
past
had
fashioned
the
ichthyosaurus
and
the
mastodon
by
what
right
he
cried
do
you
assume
that
you
are
the
literary
messiah
who
appointed
you
what
divine
power
has
made
you
the
steward
of
my
mite
and
of
theirs
whom
you
have
robbed
i
am
a
i
tread
the
high
hills
of
mankind
i
point
the
way
to
the
future
i
light
up
the
abysses
of
the
past
were
not
my
stature
gigantic
how
could
i
hold
the
torch
in
all
men
sight
the
very
souls
that
i
tread
underfoot
realise
as
their
dying
gaze
follows
me
the
possibilities
with
which
the
future
is
big
eternally
secure
i
carry
the
essence
of
what
is
cosmic
of
what
is
divine
i
am
homer
goethe
shakespeare
i
am
an
embodiment
of
the
same
force
of
which
alexander
cæsar
confucius
and
the
christos
were
also
embodiments
none
so
strong
as
to
resist
me
a
sudden
madness
overcame
ernest
at
this
boast
he
must
strike
now
or
never
he
must
rid
humanity
of
this
dangerous
maniac
this
demon
of
strength
with
a
power
ten
times
intensified
he
raised
a
heavy
chair
so
as
to
hurl
it
at
reginald
head
and
crush
it
reginald
stood
there
calmly
a
smile
upon
his
lips
primal
cruelties
rose
from
the
depth
of
his
nature
still
he
smiled
turning
his
luminous
gaze
upon
the
boy
and
behold
ernest
hand
began
to
shake
the
chair
fell
from
his
grasp
he
tried
to
call
for
help
but
no
sound
issued
from
his
lips
utterly
paralysed
he
confronted
the
force
minutes
eternities
passed
and
still
those
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
but
this
was
no
longer
reginald
it
was
all
brain
only
brain
a
tremendous
infinitely
complex
infinitely
strong
not
more
than
a
mile
away
ethel
endeavoured
to
call
to
him
through
the
night
the
telephone
rang
once
twice
thrice
insistingly
but
ernest
heard
it
not
something
dragged
him
dragged
the
nerves
from
his
body
dragged
dragged
dragged
it
was
an
irresistible
suction
pitiless
passionless
immense
sparks
blue
crimson
and
violet
seemed
to
play
around
the
living
battery
it
reached
the
finest
fibres
of
his
mind
slowly
every
trace
of
mentality
disappeared
first
the
will
then
feeling
judgment
memory
fear
even
all
that
was
stored
in
his
came
forth
to
be
absorbed
by
that
mighty
engine
the
princess
with
the
yellow
veil
appeared
flitted
across
the
room
and
melted
away
she
was
followed
by
childhood
memories
heads
boys
faces
he
saw
his
dead
mother
waving
her
arms
to
him
an
expression
of
distorted
the
placid
features
then
throwing
a
kiss
to
him
she
too
disappeared
picture
on
picture
followed
words
of
love
that
he
had
spoken
sins
virtues
magnanimities
meannesses
terrors
mathematical
formulas
even
and
snatches
of
songs
leontina
came
and
was
swallowed
up
no
it
was
ethel
who
was
trying
to
speak
to
him
trying
to
warn
she
waved
her
hands
in
frantic
despair
she
was
gone
a
pale
face
dark
dishevelled
hair
jack
how
he
had
changed
he
was
in
the
circle
of
the
vampire
transforming
might
jack
he
cried
surely
jack
had
something
to
explain
something
to
tell
him
some
word
that
if
spoken
would
bring
rest
to
his
soul
he
saw
the
words
rise
to
the
lips
but
before
he
had
time
to
utter
them
his
image
also
had
vanished
and
reginald
reginald
too
was
gone
there
was
only
the
mighty
brain
panting
whirling
then
there
was
nothing
the
annihilation
of
ernest
fielding
was
complete
vacantly
he
stared
at
the
walls
at
the
room
and
at
his
master
the
latter
was
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
he
breathed
deeply
the
flush
of
youth
spread
over
his
features
his
eyes
sparkled
with
a
new
and
dangerous
brilliancy
he
took
the
thing
that
had
once
been
ernest
fielding
by
the
hand
and
led
it
to
its
room
xxxi
with
the
first
flush
of
the
morning
ethel
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
house
on
riverside
drive
she
had
not
heard
from
ernest
and
had
been
unable
to
obtain
connection
with
him
at
the
telephone
anxiety
had
hastened
her
steps
she
brushed
against
jack
who
was
also
directing
his
steps
to
the
abode
of
reginald
clarke
at
the
same
time
something
that
resembled
ernest
fielding
passed
from
the
house
of
the
vampire
it
was
a
dull
and
brutish
thing
hideously
transformed
without
a
vestige
of
mind
mr
fielding
cried
ethel
beside
herself
with
fear
as
she
saw
him
descending
ernest
jack
gasped
no
less
startled
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
ernest
head
followed
the
source
of
the
sound
but
no
spark
of
recognition
illumined
the
deadness
of
his
eyes
without
a
present
and
without
a
past
blindly
a
gibbering
idiot
he
stumbled
down
the
stairs
