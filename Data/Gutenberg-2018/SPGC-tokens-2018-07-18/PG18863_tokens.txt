well
i
mean
there
davenham
now
and
davenham
came
the
scornful
retort
what
does
it
matter
what
happens
to
davenham
he
absolutely
useless
to
the
house
rotten
at
games
and
spends
his
whole
time
reading
about
fossils
who
cares
a
curse
about
davenham
oh
i
suppose
you
right
but
my
dear
ass
of
course
i
am
right
meredith
is
a
simply
glorious
fellow
do
you
remember
the
way
he
brought
down
freeman
in
the
two
cock
why
the
house
simply
could
get
on
without
him
to
gordon
all
this
conveyed
very
little
he
had
no
idea
who
meredith
or
davenham
were
the
only
thing
he
realised
was
that
for
those
who
wore
a
blue
and
gold
ribbon
laws
ceased
to
exist
it
was
apparently
rather
advantageous
to
get
into
the
fifteen
he
had
not
looked
on
athletics
in
that
light
before
obviously
his
preparatory
school
had
failed
singularly
to
keep
level
with
the
times
he
had
always
been
told
by
the
masters
there
that
games
were
only
important
for
training
the
body
but
at
fernhurst
they
seemed
the
one
thing
that
mattered
to
the
athlete
all
things
are
forgiven
there
was
clearly
a
lot
to
learn
to
him
who
desireth
much
much
is
given
and
to
him
who
desireth
little
little
is
given
but
to
neither
according
to
the
letter
of
his
desire

this

am
bringing
you
is
a
very
small
return
for
all
you
have
given
me
in
every
mood
in
every
phase
of
my
shifting
pilgrimage
i
have
found
you
ever
the
same
loving
sympathetic
wise
you
have
been
with
me
in
my
success
and
in
my
happiness
in
my
failures
and
in
my
disappointments
in
the
hours
when
i
have
followed
wandering
fires
there
has
never
yet
come
to
me
a
moment
when
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
but
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
find
you
at
my
side
in
return
for
so
much
this
first
book
of
mine
is
a
very
small
offering
but
yet
i
bring
it
to
you
simply
because
it
is
my
first
for
whatever
altars
i
may
have
raised
by
the
wayside
whatever
ephemeral
loyalties
may
have
swayed
me
my
one
real
lodestar
has
always
been
your
love
and
sympathy
and
guidance
and
as
in
life
it
has
always
been
to
you
first
that
i
have
brought
my
troubles
my
aims
my

books
have
their
fates
and
this
one
has
been
curious
i
wrote
it
between
january
and
march
when
i
was
seventeen
and
a
half
years
old
and
in
camp
at
berkhamsted
with
the
inns
of
court
i
loathed
it
there
everything
about
it
the
impersonal
military
machine
the
monotonous
routine
of
drills
and
musketry
the
endless
the
perpetual
petty
i
kept
comparing
my
present
life
with
that
which
i
had
been
leading
ten
eighteen
thirty
months
ago
at
sherborne
as
a
schoolboy
my
four
years
there
had
been
very
happy
i
was
the
kind
of
a
boy
who
gets
the
most
out
of
a
public
school
i
loved
cricket
and
football
and
was
reasonably
good
at
them
i
was
in
the
first
xv
and
my
last
summer
headed
the
batting
averages
my
father
had
lit
in
me
a
love
of
poetry
and
an
interest
in
history
and
the
classics
more
often
than
not
i
went
into
a
looking
forward
to
the
hour
that
lay
ahead
i
enjoyed
the
whole
competitive
drama
of
school
life
the
cups
and
caps
and
form
promotions
as
i
marched
as
a
cadet
over
ashridge
park
i
remembered
that
a
year
ago
i
had
been
bicycling
down
to
the
football
field
for
a
punt
about
on
upper
as
i
listened
to
a
lecture
on
the
establishment
of
an
infantry
brigade
i
thought
of
the
sixth
form
sitting
under
that
fine
scholar
and
wordsworthian
nowell
smith
to
a
discussion
of
victorian
poetry
in
the
evenings
on
my
way
to
night
operations
passing
berkhamsted
school
and
looking
at
the
lighted
windows
i
would
think
at
sherborne
now
they
are
sitting
round
the
games
study
fire
waiting
for
the
bell
to
ring
for
hall
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
i
pictured
myself
back
at
school
i
was
in
a
nostalgic
mood
but
i
was
also
in
a
rebellious
mood
intensely
though
i
had
enjoyed
my
four
years
at
sherborne
i
had
been
in
constant
conflict
with
authority
that
conflict
so
it
seemed
to
me
had
been
in
the
main
caused
and
determined
by
authority
inability
or
refusal
to
recognise
the
true
nature
of
school
life
the
public
school
system
was
venerated
as
a
pillar
of
the
british
empire
and
out
of
that
veneration
had
grown
a
myth
of
the
ideal
public
school
boy
brushwood
boy
in
no
sense
had
i
incarnated
such
a
myth
and
it
had
been
responsible
i
felt
for
half
my
troubles
i
wanted
to
expose
it
those
moods
of
nostalgia
and
rebellion
fused
finally
in
an
imperious
need
to
relive
my
school
days
on
paper
to
put
it
all
down
term
by
term
exactly
as
it
had
been
to
explain
interpret
justify
my
point
of
view
i
wrote
the
book
in
six
and
a
half
weeks
getting
up
at
half
past
four
every
morning
and
returning
to
my
manuscript
at
night
after
the
parades
i
posted
it
section
by
section
to
my
father
who
corrected
the
spelling
and
punctuation
interjected
an
occasional
phrase
and
sent
it
to
be
typed
i
never
revised
it
as
the
manuscript
shows
it
was
printed
as
it
was
written
paragraph
by
paragraph
the
book
after
two
or
three
refusals
was
accepted
by
grant
richards
and
published
in
july
in
the
same
week
that
i
was
posted
as
a
to
the
in
france
it
could
not
have
come
out
under
luckier
auspices
it
had
an
immediate
news
value
there
was
a
boom
in
soldier
poets
robert
graves
siegfried
sassoon
robert
nichols
turner
had
recently
made
their
debuts
here
was
a
soldier
novelist
the
first
and
in
his
teens
as
always
in
there
was
a
demand
for
books
and
there
was
that
summer
a
dearth
of
novels
a
spirit
of
challenge
and
criticism
was
in
the
air
the
war
after
three
years
was
still
bogged
down
and
public
opinion
attributed
allied
failings
in
the
field
to
mismanagement
in
high
places
the
rebelliousness
of
loom
of
was
in
tune
with
the
temper
of
the
hour
finally
i
had
the
immense
advantage
of
being
the
son
of
arthur
waugh
my
father
as
a
critic
and
a
publisher
was
one
of
the
most
loved
and
respected
figures
in
the
world
of
letters
many
were
anxious
to
give
his
son
a
chance
the
book
had
a
flattering
reception
nothing
of
any
particular
interest
was
being
published
at
the
moment
and
reviewers
welcomed
it
squire
gerald
gould
ralph
straus
osborn
all
made
it
their
book
of
the
week
nor
was
it
noticed
only
in
the
book
sections
richards
had
suggested
that
thomas
seccombe
who
was
then
history
professor
at
sandhurst
and
had
introduced
the
book
to
him
should
write
a
preface
that
preface
discussed
the
public
school
system
in
the
light
of
contemporary
events
the
system
seccombe
wrote
has
fairly
helped
you
may
say
to
get
us
out
of
the
mess
of
august
yes
but
it
contributed
heavily
to
get
us
into
it
the
preface
encouraged
and
helped
a
journalist
to
use
the
book
as
the
text
for
a
general
article
within
a
month
it
had
received
columns
of
reviews
and
was
in
its
third
impression
grant
richards
told
my
father
that
with
any
luck
he
would
sell
five
thousand
copies
that
was
at
the
end
of
the
august
three
weeks
later
the
schools
went
back
and
half
the
housemasters
in
the
country
found
their
desks
littered
with
letters
from
anxious
parents
demanding
an
assurance
that
their
bobbie
was
not
subject
to
the
temptations
described
in
this
alarming
book
in
the
schoolmasters
hit
back
and
by
the
book
had
become
the
centre
of
violent
controversy
in
many
schools
the
book
was
banned
and
several
boys
were
caned
for
reading
it
canon
edward
lyttleton
the
of
eton
wrote
a
article
in
then
an
influential
monthly
explaining
how
biased
and
partial
a
picture
the
school
gave
ran
for
ten
weeks
and
for
six
a
correspondence
filling
three
or
four
pages
an
issue
in
which
schoolmaster
after
schoolmaster
asserted
that
whatever
might
be
true
of
fernhurst
at
his
school
it
was
all
very
different
grant
richards
adeptly
fanned
the
conflagration
he
had
initiated
that
summer
an
original
style
of
advertising
he
inserted
each
week
in
the
literary
a
half
column
of
gossip
about
his
books
and
authors
it
was
set
in
small
heavy
black
type
and
caught
the
eye
richards
was
a
good
writer
and
it
was
very
readable
he
was
i
think
the
first
publisher
to
exploit
the
publicity
value
of
unfavourable
comment
richard
hughes
at
that
time
in
the
sixth
form
at
charterhouse
wrote
as
his
weekly
essay
an
attack
on
loom
of
his
form
master
dames
longworth
a
fine
old
tory
sent
it
up
to
as
a
counterblast
to
such
pernicious
stuff
next
week
grant
richards
quoted
him
mr
dames
longworth
called
the
book
pernicious
stuff
but
clement
shorter
prophesied
in
that
it
would
prove
the
uncle
tom
cabin
of
the
public
school
system
by
christmas
the
book
was
a
best
seller
a
modern
reader
will
wonder
what
all
this
fuss
and
indignation
was
about
two
points
are
to
be
remembered
first
that
before
world
war
i
britain
imperial
destiny
was
never
questioned
and
the
public
school
system
as
a
bulwark
of
empire
was
held
sacrosanct
second
that
no
book
before
loom
of
had
accepted
as
part
of
the
fabric
of
school
life
the
inevitable
emotional
consequences
of
a
monastic
herding
together
for
eight
months
of
the
year
of
thirteen
year
old
children
and
eighteen
year
old
adolescents
on
that
issue
such
a
complete
conspiracy
of
silence
had
been
maintained
that
when
fathers
were
asked
by
their
wives
and
schoolmasters
by
parents
who
had
not
themselves
been
at
public
schools
whether
such
things
really
could
take
place
the
only
defence
was
a
grudging
admission
perhaps
in
a
bad
house
in
a
bad
school
in
a
bad
time
i
followed
the
controversy
with
mixed
feelings
i
was
delighted
of
course
at
the
book
success
at
the
same
time
i
was
distressed
at
being
accused
of
having
libelled
the
school
where
i
had
been
so
happy
to
which
i
was
so
devoted
and
to
so
many
of
whose
masters
in
particular
its
headmaster
i
owed
so
much
well
that
is
all
a
long
long
time
ago
and
usually
nothing
is
more
dead
and
dated
than
the
book
which
once
caused
controversy
yet
loom
of
has
continued
to
sell
steadily
from
one
year
to
the
next
in
it
was
included
in
cassell
pocket
library
in
it
was
issued
as
a
penguin
and
now
that
the
original
plates
are
wearing
out
mr
martin
secker
and
the
directors
of
the
richards
press
feel
that
it
is
worth
their
while
to
reset
the
type
and
give
the
book
another
lease
of
life
i
hope
that
their
confidence
will
be
justified
if
it
is
it
will
be
for
reasons
very
different
from
those
which
made
loom
of
a
best
seller
in
the
modern
reader
will
find
nothing
here
to
shock
or
startle
him
several
years
ago
a
friend
was
reading
the
book
in
my
company
when
do
i
reach
scene
he
asked
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
you
passed
it
ten
pages
back
i
told
him
at
the
same
time
the
book
is
not
presented
as
a
period
piece
though
england
is
a
different
country
socially
and
economically
from
what
it
was
in
when
i
went
to
sherborne
i
do
not
think
that
in
essentials
the
life
of
the
public
school
boy
has
greatly
changed
most
schools
are
larger
than
they
were
but
they
have
retained
the
same
traditions
and
ideals
there
is
the
same
atmosphere
of
rivalry
and
competing
loyalties
youth
has
the
same
basic
problems
is
fired
by
the
same
ambitions
beset
by
the
same
doubts
and
if
the
modern
reader
after
turning
a
page
or
two
finds
his
attention
held
and
wants
to
go
on
reading
it
will
mean
that
this
book
has
become
at
last
what
in
fact
it
was
always
meant
to
be
a
realistic
but
romantic
story
of
healthy
adolescence
set
against
the
background
of
an
average
english
public
school

and

as
to

ended
also
seldom
had
he
felt
such
a
supreme
happiness
as
when
he
stepped
out
at
fernhurst
station
and
between
his
father
and
mother
walked
up
the
broad
white
road
that
led
past
the
eversham
hotel
to
the
great
grey
abbey
that
watches
as
a
sentinel
over

dreamy
wessex
town
there
are
few
schools
in
england
more
surrounded
with
the
glamour
of
mediæval
days
than
fernhurst
founded
in
the
eighth
century
by
a
saxon
saint
it
was
the
abode
of
monks
till
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
then
after
a
short
interregnum
edward
vi
endowed
it
and
restored
the
old
curriculum
the
buildings
are
unchanged
it
is
true
that
there
have
sprung
up
new
round
the
court
and
that
opposite
the
cloisters
a
huge
yellow
block
of
buildings
has
been
erected
which
provides
workshops
and
laboratories
but
the
abbey
and
the
school
house
studies
stand
as
they
stood
seven
hundred
years
ago
to
a
boy
of
any
imagination
such
a
place
could
not
but
waken
a
wonderful
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
gordon
gazing
from
the
school
gateway
across
to
the
grey
studies
was
taken
for
a
few
moments
clean
outside
himself
the
next
few
hours
only
served
to
deepen
this
wonder
and
admiration
for
fernhurst
is
prodigal
of
associations
the
school
house
is
a
magnificent
room
where
generations
of
men
have
cut
their
names
and
above
the
ledge
on
which
repose
the
silver
challenge
cups
the
house
has
won
is
a
large
statue
of
king
edward
vi
looking
down
on
the
row
of
tables
when
he
first
entered
the
hall
gordon
pitied
those
in
other
houses
immensely
it
seemed
to
him
that
though
in
the
outhouses
as
they
were
called
at
fernhurst
the
eugenic
machinery
might
be
more
up
to
date
and
the
method
of
lighting
and
heating
far
more
satisfactory
yet
it
could
not
be
the
same
there
as
in
the
school
house
and
he
never
quite
freed
himself
of
the
illusion
that
if
the
truth
were
known
every
outhouse
boy
rather
regretted
that
he
had
not
chosen
otherwise
for
indeed
the
bloods
of
other
houses
are
very
often
found
sitting
over
the
fire
in
the
school
house
games
study
until
about
six
gordon
could
not
have
been
happier
his
future
seemed
so
full
of
possibilities
but
when
his
father
and
mother
left
him
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
back
to
town
and
the
evening
train
brought
with
it
a
swarm
of
boys
in
the
most
wonderful
ties
and
socks
and
all
so
engrossed
in
their
own
affairs
and
so
indifferent
to
his
gordon
began
to
feel
very
lonely
supper
was
not
till
nine
and
he
had
three
hours
to
put
in
very
disconsolately
he
wandered
round
the
green
slopes
above
the
town
where
was
the
town
football
ground
and
where
in
the
summer
term
those
members
of
the
fifteen
who
despised
cricket
would
enjoy
their
quiet
pipe
and
long
for
the
rains
of
november
but
that
walk
did
not
take
long
especially
as
he
did
not
dare
to
go
out
of
the
sight
of
the
abbey
for
fear
of
getting
lost
when
he
returned
to
the
house
the
court
was
loud
with
shouts
and
laughter
everyone
had
something
to
do
there
was
the
luggage
to
fetch
from
the
the
town
porter
known
generally
as
slimy
tim
was
waiting
to
be
tipped
health
certificates
had
to
be
produced
there
was
a
sporting
chance
of
finding
in
bookshop
out
of
bounds
during
an
english
version
of
vergil
and
xenophon
there
were
a
hundred
things
to
do
for
everyone
except
gordon
there
were
several
other
new
boys
doubtless
to
be
found
among
this
unending
stream
of
bowler
hats
but
he
saw
no
way
of
discovering
them
he
did
it
is
true
make
one
attempt
very
bravely
he
walked
up
to
a
rather
bored
individual
who
was
leaning
against
the
door
that
led
into
the
studies
and
asked
him
if
he
was
a
new
boy
his
reception
was
not
friendly
the
person
in
question
was
sandham
of
the
lower
sixth
who
had
been
made
a
house
prefect
and
was
very
conscious
of
it
and
who
was
also
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
very
tall
his
friends
called
him
the
cockroach
and
gordon
was
told
politely
to
go
elsewhere
he
did
not
however
go
where
he
was
told
but
sauntered
sadly
down
to
the
matron
room
only
to
find
it
full
of
people
all
with
some
complaint
some
had
lost
their
keys
others
were
furious
that
their
people
should
have
been
charged
for
biscuits
and
sultana
cake
that
they
had
never
had
but
the
greater
part
were
wanting
to
know
why
the
old
bathroom
had
been
turned
into
a
study
for
the
chief
secretary
while
they
had
been
given
in
exchange
a
lot
of
small
zinc
to
the
smaller
members
of
the
house
this
change
was
rather
popular
on
the
days
when
there
were
only
four
baths
among
eighty
it
did
not
matter
very
much
to
them
how
large
they
were
if
they
were
always
occupied
by
the
bloods
while
however
small
the
new
baths
might
be
there
were
sufficient
to
go
round
the
bloods
did
not
look
on
the
matter
in
this
light
gordon
walked
from
room
to
room
utterly
miserable
nobody
took
the
slightest
notice
of
him
only
one
person
asked
his
name
and
that
was
a
small
person
of
one
term
standing
who
wanted
to
show
that
he
was
a
power
in
the
land
at
last
however
the
old
cracked
bell
rang
out
for
supper
and
very
thankfully
he
took
his
place
among
the
new
boys
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
evening
prayers
in
the
school
house
had
once
been
rather
a
festive
occasion
and
a
hymn
chosen
by
the
head
of
the
house
was
sung
every
night
it
had
been
the
custom
to
choose
a
hymn
with
some
topical
allusion
for
instance
on
the
evening
when
the
house
tutor
had
given
a
hundred
lines
to
every
member
of
the
for
disturbing
a
masters
meeting
by
playing
cricket
next
door
they
chose
raged
the
tempest
the
and
on
one
occasion
when
an
unpopular
prefect
had
been
unexpectedly
expelled
the
house
was
soothed
with
the
strains
of
perfect
but
those
days
were
over
a
new
headmaster
had
come
with
an
ear
for
music
and
the
riot
of
melody
that
surged
from
the
a
table
seemed
to
him
not
only
blasphemous
but
also
inartistic
and
so
stopped
and
only
a
few
prayers
were
read
instead
on
this
particular
evening
the
chief
was
in
high
spirits
it
was
characteristic
of
his
indomitable
kindliness
and
optimism
that
though
he
ended
every
term
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
having
strained
his
energy
and
endurance
to
the
he
invariably
began
the
new
term
in
a
spirit
of
geniality
and
hope
it
was
not
till
years
later
that
gordon
came
to
understand
the
depth
of
unselfish
idealism
that
burned
behind
the
quiet
modesty
of
the
chief
but
even
at
first
sight
the
least
impressionable
boy
was
conscious
of
being
under
the
influence
of
an
unusual
personality
there
was
nothing
of
the
theatrical
pedagogue
about
him
he
surrounded
himself
with
no
trappings
of
a
proud
authority
his
voice
was
gentle
and
persuasive
his
smile
as
winning
almost
as
a
child
the
little
speech
with
which
he
welcomed
the
house
back
and
a
passing
allusion
half
humorous
half
appealing
to
the
changes
in
the
were
perhaps
too
homely
to
impress
the
imagination
of
the
average
inhuman
boy
but
they
were
the
sincere
expression
of
the
man
an
idealist
with
an
unfailing
faith
in
human
nature
founded
in
an
even
deeper
faith
in
christianity
when
he
had
gone
gordon
ventured
to
look
round
at
the
sea
of
faces
on
a
raised
dais
was
the
sixth
form
table
in
the
middle
haughty
with
but
watchful
eyes
sat
the
captain
of
the
house
lovelace
major
in
many
ways
the
finest
athlete
fernhurst
ever
produced
who
had
already
got
his
county
cap
and
played
rugger
for
richmond
gordon
had
seen
him
bat
at
lord
for
the
public
schools
and
before
he
had
come
to
fernhurst
lovelace
had
been
the
hero
of
his
imagination
ambition
could
hardly
attain
a
higher
pedestal
there
were
about
twelve
in
all
at
the
sixth
form
table
of
whom
the
majority
were
prefects
and
no
one
could
leave
the
hall
till
one
of
them
went
out
after
a
few
minutes
conversation
in
which
no
one
ate
anything
although
plates
of
hot
soup
were
busily
provided
someone
got
up
and
went
out
immediately
there
was
a
rush
towards
the
door
and
gordon
was
borne
down
the
long
winding
passage
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
dormitories
here
however
for
some
reason
everyone
stopped
and
began
to
talk
at
the
top
of
their
voices
gordon
saw
no
reason
for
the
delay
but
thought
it
better
to
follow
the
throng
and
waited
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
train
up
from
town
had
just
come
in
there
are
some
who
always
demand
the
last
ounce
of
flesh
there
are
always
those
who
return
by
the
last
possible
train
although
it
stops
at
every
station
on
the
way
suddenly
however
the
house
tutor
shouted
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
lights
out
in
the
upper
dormitories
by
and
the
procession
moved
upstairs
the
upper
dormitories
in
the
school
house
were
like
most
other
school
dormitories
a
dismal
spectacle
there
was
a
long
passage
running
down
from
the
house
tutor
room
and
on
the
left
were
doors
leading
into
long
bare
rooms
with
the
usual
beds
and
the
usual
basins
on
the
side
was
the
bathroom
the
upper
dormitories
were
occupied
by
the
smaller
boys
of
the
house
once
a
prefect
had
been
put
in
charge
over
each
room
but
the
system
did
not
work
very
well
and
soon
came
to
an
abrupt
end
so
that
there
was
only
the
house
tutor
to
keep
them
in
order
till
the
prefects
went
to
bed
in
the
lower
dormitories
an
hour
later
and
then
any
sound
was
promptly
dealt
with
gordon
had
been
placed
in
the
largest
room
which
was
known
as
the
nursery
it
contained
ten
beds
and
only
four
of
its
inhabitants
were
of
more
than
one
term
standing
among
other
less
enviable
claims
to
fame
it
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
finest
dormitory
and
every
night
its
members
would
race
up
from
supper
to
play
their
game
before
the
house
tutor
came
to
put
out
lights
at
the
new
boys
took
it
in
turns
to
keep
cave
and
it
must
be
owned
that
for
the
first
few
weeks
the
sentinel
rather
preferred
the
rôle
of
onlooker
to
that
of
player
and
found
it
hard
to
sympathise
with
those
who
were
continually
flinging
abuse
at
the
huge
football
crowds
at
stamford
bridge
this
night
there
was
of
course
hardly
any
ragging
there
was
so
much
to
talk
about
and
some
faint
interest
was
even
taken
in
the
new
boys
for
two
very
young
people
turner
and
roberts
swaggered
into
the
dormitories
just
to
have
a
squint
at
the
new
kids
but
after
a
casual
inspection
turner
said
in
a
lordly
manner
good
lord
what
a
crew
and
the
pair
sought
better
things
elsewhere
turner
and
roberts
were
very
insignificant
people
during
the
daytime
they
were
little
use
at
games
and
even
a
year
spasmodic
cribbing
had
only
managed
to
secure
them
a
promotion
from
the
second
form
to
the
third
but
when
the
evening
came
they
were
indeed
great
men
and
ruled
over
a
small
dormitory
that
contained
besides
themselves
only
four
new
boys
who
looked
up
to
them
as
gods
and
hung
on
their
every
word
but
very
soon
the
wanderings
of
these
two
gentlemen
ceased
and
at
the
sound
of
the
house
tutor
tread
down
the
passage
they
fled
very
ingloriously
to
their
own
abode
mr
parkinson
the
house
tutor
was
one
of
the
most
popular
masters
in
the
school
he
had
only
just
missed
his
blue
at
oxford
and
since
he
had
gone
down
had
devoted
all
his
energies
to
training
on
the
junior
members
of
the
house
at
football
and
cricket
he
was
in
rather
a
hurry
this
particular
evening
as
he
had
to
make
out
the
list
of
studies
but
he
shook
hands
with
everyone
and
asked
all
the
new
boys
their
names
before
turning
out
the
lights
with
instructions
not
to
kick
up
too
much
row
at
last
gordon
was
at
rest
for
ten
hours
at
least
he
would
not
have
to
worry
about
anything
he
lay
back
in
bed
contentedly
and
listened
to
the
conversation
as
was
natural
the
talk
was
at
first
only
about
the
holidays
but
it
soon
drifted
round
to
school
politics
and
one
bradford
began
to
hold
forth
on
the
composition
of
the
fifteen
as
if
he
was
the
captain
bosom
friend
to
gordon
of
course
most
of
the
names
mentioned
signified
nothing
he
gathered
that
the
great
lovelace
was
going
to
be
captain
and
was
sure
to
have
rows
with
buller
the
games
master
but
besides
this
he
picked
up
very
little
gradually
the
conversation
turned
on
individuals
and
especially
on
a
certain
meredith
who
was
apparently
a
with
a
reputation
that
did
not
end
on
the
cricket
pitch
you
know
i
think
meredith
goes
a
bit
too
far
at
times
came
a
voice
from
the
middle
of
the
room
bradford
rose
at
once
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
meredith
go
too
far
why
he
is
a
splendid
and
far
and
away
the
finest
in
the
school
you
must
allow
a
good
deal
to
a
blood
like
him
oh
i
know
he
is
a
magnificent
athlete
and
all
that
but
do
you
think
he
does
rather
a
lot
of
harm
in
the
house
harm
who
to
well
i
mean
there
davenham
now
and
davenham
came
the
scornful
retort
what
does
it
matter
what
happens
to
davenham
he
absolutely
useless
to
the
house
rotten
at
games
and
spends
his
whole
time
reading
about
fossils
who
cares
a
curse
about
davenham
oh
i
suppose
you
are
right
but
my
dear
ass
of
course
i
am
right
meredith
is
a
simply
glorious
fellow
do
you
remember
the
way
he
brought
down
freeman
in
the
two
cock
why
the
house
simply
could
get
on
without
him
to
gordon
all
this
conveyed
very
little
he
had
no
idea
who
meredith
or
davenham
were
the
only
thing
he
realised
was
that
for
those
who
wore
a
blue
and
gold
ribbon
laws
ceased
to
exist
it
was
apparently
rather
advantageous
to
get
into
the
fifteen
he
had
not
looked
on
athletics
in
that
light
before
obviously
his
preparatory
school
had
failed
singularly
to
keep
level
with
the
times
he
had
always
been
told
by
the
masters
there
that
games
were
only
important
for
training
the
body
but
at
fernhurst
they
seemed
the
one
thing
that
mattered
to
the
athlete
all
things
are
forgiven
there
was
clearly
a
lot
to
learn
chapter
ii
finding
his
feet
the
new
boy
first
week
at
a
public
school
is
probably
the
most
wretched
he
will
ever
pass
in
his
life
it
is
not
that
he
is
bullied
boots
are
not
shied
at
him
when
he
says
his
prayers
he
is
not
tossed
in
a
blanket
it
is
merely
that
he
is
utterly
lonely
is
in
constant
fear
of
making
mistakes
is
never
certain
of
what
may
happen
next
and
so
makes
for
himself
troubles
that
do
not
exist
and
when
gordon
wrote
home
to
his
people
at
the
end
of
his
second
day
it
did
not
need
a
very
clever
mother
to
read
between
the
lines
and
see
that
her
son
was
hopelessly
miserable
his
worries
began
at
once
on
the
first
day
of
term
discipline
is
of
course
very
slack
there
is
only
an
hour
work
which
is
for
the
most
part
spent
in
finding
out
what
books
are
needed
there
is
no
preparation
set
for
the
evening
breakfast
is
at
instead
of
and
it
does
not
matter
how
late
anyone
comes
in
and
so
when
at
eight
the
school
house
butler
who
had
watched
many
generations
pass
by
with
the
same
imperturbable
smile
walked
down
the
dormitories
ringing
a
horribly
cracked
bell
no
one
paid
any
attention
there
was
tons
of
time
ordinarily
no
one
ever
got
up
till
the
quarter
and
well
twenty
past
would
be
ample
a
voice
from
the
end
of
the
room
muttered
drowsily
damn
that
bell
but
besides
that
nothing
happened
gordon
was
fearfully
perplexed
he
had
expected
everyone
to
leap
out
of
bed
seize
a
towel
and
rush
to
the
but
no
one
had
moved
could
it
be
possible
that
they
were
still
asleep
and
had
not
heard
the
bell
it
seemed
incredible
but
it
might
be
so
and
if
it
were
ought
he
to
wake
them
up
it
seemed
rather
cheek
for
a
new
boy
but
then
supposing
the
whole
dormitory
were
late
greatly
daring
he
stretched
out
a
hand
and
touched
the
arm
of
the
boy
sleeping
next
him
the
individual
in
question
merely
turned
over
subconsciously
and
said
something
fierce
gordon
relapsed
into
a
state
of
terror
during
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
he
passed
through
all
the
miseries
of
an
unknown
fear
only
hours
ago
he
had
been
at
breakfast
with
his
father
and
mother
in
his
home
at
hampstead
it
seemed
years
ago
here
he
was
face
to
face
with
horrible
unexplained
things
the
suspense
grew
unbearable
he
was
sure
he
heard
someone
moving
next
door
the
others
were
getting
up
he
would
be
late
his
first
day
what
a
start
but
just
as
he
was
visioning
the
most
dire
punishments
james
an
insignificant
person
of
one
term
standing
slowly
pushed
back
the
picked
up
a
towel
and
lethargically
moved
towards
the
door
gordon
jumped
up
happy
at
last
and
made
for
the
huge
new
bathroom
it
had
an
iron
floor
sloped
so
as
to
allow
water
to
drain
off
easily
and
contained
six
small
baths
and
showers
fixed
above
them
the
room
was
practically
empty
he
was
glad
of
this
he
did
not
want
to
have
a
shower
with
a
lot
of
people
looking
on
the
water
was
very
cold
he
was
used
to
a
tepid
bath
but
by
the
time
he
had
begun
to
dry
the
place
was
full
of
boys
all
shouting
at
once
no
one
is
more
loud
or
insistent
than
he
who
has
just
ceased
to
be
labelled
new
he
likes
everyone
to
know
how
important
he
is
how
free
and
how
unfettered
by
rules
and
the
best
way
to
this
end
is
to
shout
and
curse
everything
the
room
was
filled
with
shouts
of
good
god
are
we
expected
to
get
clean
in
babies
tubs
what
a
fool
the
chief
is
oh
damn
your
eyes
that
my
towel
no
there
yours
you
blasted
idiot
gordon
was
immensely
shocked
at
the
language
he
had
come
from
a
preparatory
school
run
by
a
master
with
strong
views
on
swearing
and
for
that
matter
on
everything
he
had
been
kept
thoroughly
in
order
he
got
out
of
the
bathroom
as
quickly
as
possible
and
made
for
his
dormitory
it
did
not
take
long
to
dress
there
was
indeed
very
little
time
and
as
the
struck
he
was
carried
down
in
the
throng
to
the
breakfast
is
always
rather
a
scramble
and
nowhere
more
so
than
at
a
public
school
the
usual
fernhurst
breakfast
lasted
about
ten
minutes
hardly
anyone
spoke
only
the
ring
of
forks
on
plates
was
heard
and
an
occasional
shout
of
tea
from
the
sixth
form
table
they
alone
could
shout
at
meals
the
others
had
to
catch
the
servant
eye
however
there
was
a
good
deal
of
conversation
those
who
had
come
by
the
last
train
had
not
seen
all
their
friends
the
night
before
there
was
much
shaking
of
hands
in
the
middle
a
loud
voice
from
the
head
of
the
sixth
form
table
shouted
out
silence
i
want
to
see
all
new
boys
in
my
study
at
nine
it
was
clarke
the
head
of
the
house
who
spoke
he
was
tall
with
one
of
those
brilliant
scholars
who
are
too
brilliant
to
get
scholarships
he
was
a
fanatic
in
many
ways
a
militarist
essentially
a
firebrand
always
there
was
bound
to
be
trouble
during
his
reign
he
could
never
let
anything
alone
he
was
a
great
fighter
gordon
looked
up
with
immense
awe
clarke
looked
so
powerful
so
tremendous
even
lovelace
himself
was
not
much
greater
he
wondered
vaguely
what
would
be
said
to
them
and
indeed
clarke
was
even
more
imposing
in
his
own
study
the
back
of
the
room
sloped
down
into
a
low
alcove
in
which
hung
strange
egyptian
curtains
the
walls
were
decorated
with
a
few
photogravures
behind
the
door
was
a
pile
of
cases
clarke
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
now
you
are
all
quite
new
to
school
life
he
began
entirely
ignorant
of
its
perils
and
dangers
and
you
are
now
making
the
only
beginning
you
can
ever
make
you
start
with
clean
fresh
reputations
i
do
know
how
long
you
will
remain
so
but
you
must
remember
that
you
are
members
of
the
finest
house
in
fernhurst
last
year
we
had
the
two
finest
athletes
wincheston
and
lovelace
who
played
cricket
for
leicestershire
and
is
now
captain
of
the
house
we
had
also
the
two
finest
scholars
scott
and
pembroke
both
of
whom
won
scholarships
now
we
ca
all
be
county
cricketers
we
ca
all
win
scholarships
but
we
can
all
work
to
one
end
with
an
unfailing
energy
you
will
find
prefects
here
who
will
beat
you
if
you
play
the
ass
well
i
do
mind
ragging
much
and
it
is
no
disgrace
to
be
caned
for
that
but
it
is
a
disgrace
to
be
beaten
for
slacking
either
at
games
or
work
it
shows
that
you
are
an
unworthy
member
of
the
house
now
i
want
all
of
you
to
try
some
of
you
will
perhaps
never
rise
above
playing
on
house
games
or
get
higher
than
the
upper
fifth
but
if
you
can
manage
to
set
an
example
of
keenness
you
will
have
proved
yourselves
worthy
of
the
school
house
which
is
beyond
doubt
house
at
fernhurst
that
all
i
have
got
to
say
that
scene
was
in
many
ways
the
most
vivid
in
gordon
career
from
that
moment
he
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
an
individual
but
a
member
of
a
great
community
and
afterwards
when
old
boys
would
run
down
clarke
and
say
how
he
had
stirred
up
faction
and
rebellion
gordon
kept
silent
he
knew
that
whatever
mistakes
the
head
of
the
house
might
have
made
he
had
the
welfare
of
the
house
at
heart
and
loved
it
with
a
blind
unreasoning
love
that
was
completely
misunderstood
it
is
inevitable
that
a
new
boy
first
few
days
should
be
largely
taken
up
in
making
mistakes
and
though
it
is
easy
to
laugh
about
them
afterwards
at
the
time
they
are
very
real
miseries
at
fernhurst
things
are
not
made
easy
for
the
new
boy
gordon
found
himself
placed
in
the
upper
fourth
under
fleming
a
benevolent
despot
who
was
a
master
of
sarcasm
and
was
so
delighted
at
making
a
brilliant
attack
on
some
stammering
idiot
that
he
quite
forgot
to
punish
him
young
man
young
man
he
would
say
people
who
forget
their
books
are
a
confounded
nuisance
and
i
do
want
confounded
nuisances
with
me
gordon
got
on
with
him
very
well
on
the
whole
as
he
had
a
sense
of
humour
and
always
laughed
at
his
master
jokes
but
he
only
did
latin
and
english
in
the
fourth
room
for
the
whole
school
was
split
up
into
sets
regardless
of
forms
for
sharing
such
less
arduous
labours
as
science
maths
french
and
greek
so
that
gordon
found
himself
suddenly
appointed
to
mr
williams
greek
set
no
with
no
idea
of
where
to
go
after
much
wandering
he
eventually
found
the
sixth
form
room
he
entered
someone
outside
had
told
him
to
go
in
there
a
long
row
of
giants
in
collars
confronted
him
the
chief
sat
on
a
chair
reading
a
lecture
on
the
maccabees
all
eyes
seemed
turned
on
him
please
sir
he
quavered
out
in
trembling
tones
is
this
mr
greek
set
middle
school
no
v
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
gordon
fled
after
about
five
more
minutes
ineffectual
searching
he
ran
into
a
certain
robertson
in
the
cloisters
now
robertson
played
back
for
the
fifteen
i
say
are
you
one
of
the
new
boys
for
williams
set
yes
well
look
here
he
setting
us
a
paper
and
i
do
know
much
about
it
and
i
rather
want
to
delay
matters
so
look
here
hide
yourself
for
a
few
minutes
i
am
just
going
to
find
meredith
and
have
a
chat
for
ten
minutes
gordon
wandered
disconsolately
about
the
courts
when
at
last
robertson
returned
with
his
protégé
the
hour
was
well
advanced
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
robertson
to
have
to
waste
his
preparation
doing
an
imposition
on
another
occasion
one
of
the
elder
members
of
his
form
told
him
to
go
to
bogus
for
french
now
bogus
was
short
for
the
bogus
officer
and
was
the
unkind
appellation
of
one
rogers
tall
ascetic
and
superior
with
the
air
of
a
great
philosopher
he
had
like
richard
uncle
adrian
harley
attained
that
felicitous
point
of
wisdom
from
which
one
sees
all
mankind
to
be
fools
he
was
one
of
the
happy
few
who
are
really
content
for
in
the
corps
as
officer
commanding
he
could
indulge
continuously
in
his
favourite
pastime
of
hearing
his
own
voice
and
as
a
clerk
in
orders
the
pulpit
presented
admirable
opportunities
for
long
talks
that
brooked
no
interruptions
in
the
common
room
his
prolix
anecdotes
were
not
encouraged
but
in
the
pulpit
there
was
no
gainsaying
him
his
dual
personality
embodied
the
spirit
of
the
church
militant
a
situation
the
humour
of
which
the
school
did
not
fail
to
grasp
but
of
all
this
gordon
of
course
knew
nothing
after
a
long
search
for
this
eminent
divine
in
perfect
innocence
he
went
up
to
a
master
he
saw
crossing
the
courts
please
sir
can
you
tell
me
where
mr
bogus
is
he
did
not
understand
till
weeks
afterwards
why
the
master
took
such
a
long
time
to
answer
and
seemed
so
hard
put
to
it
not
to
laugh
the
story
provided
amusement
in
the
common
room
for
many
days
rogers
was
not
popular
it
was
in
this
atmosphere
of
utter
loneliness
and
inability
to
do
anything
right
that
gordon
first
week
passed
of
the
other
new
boys
none
of
them
seemed
to
him
very
much
in
his
line
there
was
foster
and
attractive
but
plausible
and
insincere
there
was
rudd
a
scholar
who
had
passed
into
the
fifth
spectacled
of
sallow
appearance
and
with
a
strange
way
of
walking
collins
was
not
so
bad
but
his
mind
ran
on
nothing
but
football
and
billiard
championships
the
rest
were
nonentities
the
set
who
drift
through
their
six
years
making
no
mark
hurting
no
one
doing
little
good
finally
they
pass
out
into
the
world
to
swell
the
rout
of
civilised
barbarians
whom
it
hurts
to
think
and
who
write
to
the
papers
talk
a
lot
about
nothing
and
then
die
and
are
forgotten
the
public
school
system
turns
out
many
of
these
for
it
loves
mediocrity
it
likes
to
be
accepted
unquestioningly
as
was
the
old
testament
but
times
change
the
old
testament
and
the
public
school
system
are
now
both
of
them
in
the
of
criticism
for
the
most
part
gordon
kept
to
himself
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
for
he
did
nothing
worthy
of
notice
he
had
rather
looked
forward
to
his
first
game
of
football
for
he
had
been
quite
a
decent
at
his
preparatory
school
he
might
perhaps
do
something
brilliant
but
for
his
first
two
days
he
was
allowed
even
to
play
a
game
with
the
other
new
boys
he
shivered
in
the
autumn
wind
while
meredith
who
rather
surprisingly
seemed
quite
an
ordinary
sort
of
person
instructed
them
in
how
to
pack
down
they
were
then
told
to
watch
the
upper
game
and
see
how
football
should
be
played
it
was
here
that
gordon
first
saw
buller
the
games
master
he
was
indeed
a
splendid
person
he
wore
a
coat
that
on
anyone
else
would
have
looked
ridiculous
and
even
so
was
strikingly
original
he
had
the
strong
face
of
one
who
had
fought
every
inch
of
his
way
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
the
bull
as
he
was
called
take
a
game
he
rushed
up
and
down
the
field
cursing
and
swearing
his
voice
thundered
over
the
ground
it
was
the
first
game
after
the
summer
holidays
and
everyone
felt
rather
flabby
at
the
great
man
burst
out
i
have
played
football
for
years
i
coached
oxford
teams
and
gloucestershire
teams
led
an
english
scrum
and
for
fifteen
years
i
have
taught
footer
here
but
never
saw
i
such
a
display
shirking
the
whole
lot
of
you
get
your
shoulders
down
and
shove
never
saw
anything
like
it
awful
the
bull
said
this
to
every
team
at
least
three
times
every
season
but
he
was
every
bit
as
generous
with
his
praise
as
with
his
blame
when
things
went
well
and
he
was
a
great
man
a
personality
even
a
desultory
woke
into
excitement
when
the
shrill
piping
voice
of
a
came
in
with
bull
coming
there
was
only
one
man
in
fernhurst
who
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
that
was
lovelace
who
was
indeed
afraid
of
nothing
and
who
towered
over
his
contemporaries
by
the
splendour
of
his
athletic
achievements
and
the
strength
of
an
personality
on
the
next
day
gordon
had
to
watch
another
upper
game
this
time
the
bull
was
more
or
less
quiet
lovelace
was
at
the
top
of
his
form
and
meredith
twice
cut
through
brilliantly
and
scored
between
the
posts
then
life
seemed
to
buller
very
good
after
the
game
he
rolled
up
to
his
house
perfectly
satisfied
whistling
to
himself
it
was
not
until
the
saturday
that
gordon
actually
played
in
a
game
he
was
originally
performing
on
the
but
after
a
few
minutes
he
was
fetched
to
fill
a
gap
in
a
house
game
he
was
shoved
into
the
scrum
was
perfectly
useless
and
spent
his
whole
time
trying
to
escape
notice
only
once
he
got
really
near
the
ball
just
before
the
ball
was
rolling
slowly
towards
him
the
opposing
had
failed
to
reach
touch
gordon
steadying
himself
as
at
soccer
took
a
tremendous
kick
at
the
ball
which
screwed
off
his
foot
and
landed
in
the
hands
of
the
outside
who
easily
outpaced
the
defence
and
scored
you
bloody
little
fool
said
someone
for
god
sake
no
soccer
tricks
here
gordon
did
not
attempt
to
repeat
the
performance
he
was
supremely
wretched
and
merely
longed
for
the
day
to
end
no
one
understood
him
or
even
wanted
to
his
home
became
a
very
heaven
to
him
during
these
days
but
sooner
or
later
pain
grows
into
a
custom
the
agonies
of
prometheus
and
ixion
must
after
a
little
while
have
ceased
to
cause
anything
more
than
boredom
as
soon
as
the
mind
is
accustomed
to
what
is
before
it
there
is
an
end
of
grief
it
is
the
series
of
unexpected
blows
that
hurts
and
so
gordon
after
his
first
week
found
that
life
was
not
so
hard
after
all
he
knew
where
his
various
were
his
was
complete
he
had
slipped
into
the
routine
and
found
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
merriment
for
anyone
with
a
sense
of
humour
fleming
was
a
constant
source
of
amusement
one
day
mansell
a
member
of
the
school
house
fifteen
had
forgotten
his
book
the
usual
penalty
for
forgetting
a
book
was
a
hundred
lines
mansell
had
been
posted
on
the
lower
ground
if
he
did
well
he
might
be
tried
for
the
second
fifteen
the
book
must
be
got
at
all
costs
please
sir
may
i
go
and
get
a
handkerchief
yes
young
man
and
hurry
up
about
it
after
five
minutes
mansell
returns
blowing
his
nose
vigorously
in
his
silk
handkerchief
of
many
colours
for
mansell
is
by
way
of
being
a
nut
the
book
is
under
his
coat
he
sits
down
fleming
fixes
him
with
a
stony
glare
a
long
pause
mansell
take
that
book
from
under
your
coat
reluctantly
the
miscreant
does
so
the
dream
of
a
second
cap
vanishes
conjurer
the
roar
of
laughter
was
sufficient
to
make
fleming
forget
all
about
impositions
but
mansell
did
not
perform
very
well
on
the
lower
ground
and
gordon
overheard
lovelace
remarking
to
meredith
that
mansell
was
really
rather
a
for
a
school
house
cap
but
whatever
his
football
performances
mansell
was
a
continual
source
of
laughter
he
and
gordon
were
in
the
same
greek
set
and
studied
under
mr
claremont
a
dry
humorist
who
had
adopted
schoolmastering
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
had
apparently
regretted
it
afterwards
and
developed
into
a
cynic
mansell
was
easily
the
most
popular
man
and
the
worst
scholar
in
the
set
in
which
there
were
nineteen
in
all
each
week
claremont
read
out
the
order
gordon
was
usually
about
up
mansell
fluctuated
one
week
he
bagged
the
translation
clarke
was
using
for
scholarship
work
he
was
second
that
week
but
clarke
discovered
the
theft
there
was
a
fall
many
names
were
read
in
the
weekly
order
but
mansell
was
not
of
them
at
last
claremont
reached
him
greek
prose
mansell
greek
translation
mansell
combined
order
mansell
a
roar
of
laughter
well
mansell
i
do
think
that
a
titter
from
your
companions
is
a
sufficient
reward
for
a
bad
work
the
immediate
result
of
this
was
that
mansell
realising
that
without
some
assistance
printed
or
otherwise
his
chances
of
a
good
report
were
small
got
leave
from
clarke
to
fetch
gordon
from
the
to
his
study
in
hall
to
prepare
the
work
together
gordon
at
once
thought
himself
a
tremendous
blood
there
were
advantages
after
all
in
being
moderately
clever
about
this
time
another
incident
helped
to
bring
gordon
a
little
more
before
the
public
eye
there
had
been
a
match
in
the
afternoon
milton
lovelace
as
happens
to
all
athletes
at
times
had
an
off
day
he
missed
an
easy
drop
fumbled
two
passes
and
when
the
school
were
leading
by
one
point
just
before
time
failed
to
collar
his
man
and
milton
a
won
by
two
points
the
bull
raged
furiously
lovelace
took
hall
that
night
he
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
in
the
and
gazed
about
seeking
someone
on
whom
to
vent
his
wrath
there
was
a
dead
silence
gordon
was
writing
hard
at
a
latin
prose
he
looked
up
for
a
second
while
thinking
of
a
word
caruthers
are
you
working
lovelace
snapped
out
yes
you
liar
you
were
looking
out
of
the
window
were
you
yes
but
i
teach
you
to
tell
lies
to
me
come
and
see
me
at
nine
very
miserably
gordon
continued
his
work
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
caruthers
will
you
take
six
or
a
hundred
lines
gordon
thought
it
was
not
the
thing
to
take
lines
six
will
you
have
it
now
or
afterwards
now
hunter
go
and
get
a
cane
from
my
study
trembling
with
fear
gordon
heard
hunter
feet
ring
down
the
stone
passage
saw
him
running
across
to
the
studies
by
the
old
wall
there
was
silence
again
then
the
sound
of
feet
hunter
returned
come
out
here
caruthers
it
hurt
tremendously
he
went
back
wishing
he
had
taken
the
hundred
lines
but
the
others
thought
it
amazingly
brave
of
him
lovelace
minor
handsome
debonair
a
swashbuckler
in
the
teeth
of
authority
came
up
afterwards
and
said
damned
plucky
of
you
my
brother
a
bit
of
an
ass
at
times
it
was
not
really
plucky
it
was
merely
the
fear
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
but
the
house
thought
that
after
all
there
might
be
something
in
at
least
one
of
those
wretched
new
kids
one
or
two
people
looked
at
him
almost
with
interest
that
night
in
hall
that
was
gordon
first
step
afterwards
things
were
not
so
hard
mansell
began
to
think
him
rather
a
sport
as
well
as
an
indispensable
aid
to
classical
studies
and
mansell
counted
for
something
meredith
smiled
at
him
one
day
a
public
school
was
not
such
a
bad
hole
after
all
and
his
cup
of
happiness
seemed
almost
running
over
when
one
afternoon
after
a
game
of
rugger
he
overheard
lovelace
minor
say
to
hunter
that
kid
caruthers
was
half
bad
for
he
saw
that
the
sure
way
to
popularity
lay
in
success
on
the
field
and
because
it
was
the
weak
as
the
strong
point
of
his
character
that
he
longed
with
a
wild
longing
for
power
and
popularity
it
was
already
his
ambition
to
be
some
day
captain
of
the
house
and
to
lead
his
side
to
glorious
victories
chapter
iii
the
new
philosophy
of
course
bull
may
be
a
jolly
fine
fellow
and
all
that
but
he
does
exceed
the
limit
at
times
lovelace
minor
was
speaking
it
was
the
evening
after
the
dulbridge
match
the
school
had
been
beaten
by
points
to
three
by
a
much
faster
and
heavier
side
meredith
had
been
ill
and
could
not
play
lovelace
major
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
the
first
half
and
though
he
had
gone
on
playing
was
very
little
use
the
match
had
all
along
been
a
foregone
conclusion
but
the
bull
had
lost
his
temper
entirely
hunter
mansell
and
jeffries
a
colt
who
ran
a
good
chance
of
getting
his
house
cap
the
next
term
were
discussing
the
matter
gordon
who
had
come
in
to
do
thucydides
was
sitting
in
the
background
a
little
shy
and
very
interested
is
it
true
said
jeffries
that
your
brother
threatened
to
resign
the
captaincy
if
he
did
not
keep
quiet
yes
by
jove
my
brother
let
him
have
it
that
what
bull
wants
he
wants
a
fellow
who
not
afraid
of
him
to
stand
up
against
him
fernhurst
has
been
run
by
him
long
enough
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
when
he
sane
i
almost
love
him
but
he
has
become
an
absolute
tyrant
thank
god
he
ca
ride
roughshod
over
my
brother
mansell
here
broke
in
mansell
was
rather
fond
of
summing
up
it
like
this
bull
a
gorgeous
fellow
he
loves
fernhurst
he
wants
to
love
everyone
in
it
but
he
does
not
understand
our
house
we
are
not
going
to
sweat
ourselves
to
win
some
rotten
gym
cup
or
house
fives
we
have
time
for
that
we
are
amateurs
we
play
the
hardest
footer
and
the
keenest
cricket
of
all
the
houses
and
that
where
we
stop
he
wants
us
to
train
every
minute
go
for
runs
in
the
afternoon
do
physical
exercises
before
breakfast
so
as
to
become
strong
englishmen
who
love
their
bodies
and
have
some
respect
for
their
mind
a
roar
of
laughter
it
was
as
though
bull
were
speaking
well
i
do
care
a
damn
myself
for
my
body
or
mind
all
i
know
is
that
the
house
is
going
to
get
the
two
cock
somehow
and
that
for
six
weeks
we
train
like
hades
and
then
when
we
got
the
cup
we
have
a
blind
we
are
pros
who
train
the
whole
year
round
amateurs
and
mansell
was
perhaps
not
far
wrong
i
say
you
know
says
hunter
who
had
a
cheerful
way
of
suddenly
flying
off
at
a
tangent
talking
of
bull
have
you
heard
of
the
row
in
his
house
intense
enthusiasm
buller
was
supposed
to
be
above
suspicion
oh
well
old
bull
came
round
the
dormitories
last
night
and
heard
peters
and
fischer
and
some
other
lads
talking
the
most
arrant
filth
he
gave
them
all
six
in
pyjamas
on
the
spot
and
fischer
is
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
be
house
captain
next
year
rather
a
jest
you
know
old
bull
thought
because
his
house
was
always
in
wonderful
training
that
the
spirit
of
innocence
ruled
over
the
place
well
he
must
be
an
ass
then
said
mansell
why
look
at
richmore
and
parry
and
even
old
johnson
has
little
respect
for
a
bourgeois
morality
mansell
was
rather
pleased
with
the
last
phrase
he
was
not
quite
certain
what
it
meant
chesterton
used
it
somewhere
probably
in
his
apology
for
george
iv
it
sounded
rather
nice
well
it
obvious
that
a
blood
must
be
a
bit
of
a
rip
and
buller
is
merely
an
asylum
for
bloods
this
rather
perplexed
gordon
he
ventured
a
question
rather
timidly
but
is
it
impossible
for
a
blood
to
be
a
decent
fellow
decent
fellow
cried
jeffries
who
on
earth
has
said
they
were
anything
else
johnson
a
simply
glorious
man
only
a
bit
fast
and
that
does
matter
much
in
a
farewell
lecture
gordon
preparatory
school
master
had
given
him
to
believe
that
it
mattered
a
good
deal
but
he
was
doubtless
times
were
changed
gordon
had
ceased
to
be
shocked
at
what
he
heard
he
was
learning
what
life
was
and
how
strange
and
beautiful
and
ugly
it
was
as
the
winter
term
drew
to
a
close
gordon
grew
more
and
more
sure
of
himself
he
had
passed
by
nearly
all
the
other
new
boys
foster
it
is
true
had
got
on
well
according
to
his
lights
and
was
on
more
than
friendly
terms
with
evans
the
school
slow
bowler
but
he
was
not
much
liked
by
his
equals
rudd
was
looked
on
quite
rightly
as
an
absolute
buffoon
collins
got
on
fairly
well
but
was
generally
admitted
to
be
a
bit
eccentric
gordon
was
without
doubt
the
pick
of
the
crew
his
position
in
form
was
a
great
help
mansell
friends
thought
him
a
cheerful
amusing
and
person
and
were
quite
pleased
to
have
him
about
the
place
next
term
he
was
going
to
have
a
study
with
jeffries
the
chief
thought
he
had
got
on
rather
too
quick
but
he
was
usually
among
the
first
three
in
his
form
and
there
was
nothing
definite
to
find
fault
with
and
after
all
his
friends
were
excellent
fellows
there
was
nothing
against
them
jeffries
was
genially
selfish
always
ready
for
a
rag
a
keen
footballer
and
had
like
most
other
public
school
boys
adopted
a
convenient
broadmindedness
with
regard
to
cribbing
and
other
matters
if
the
master
is
such
an
arrant
ass
as
to
let
you
crib
it
is
his
own
lookout
and
after
all
we
take
the
sporting
chance
lovelace
minor
was
rather
a
different
sort
of
person
very
excitable
he
despised
and
deceived
most
of
the
masters
among
his
friends
he
was
unimpeachably
loyal
he
loved
games
but
never
took
them
sufficiently
seriously
to
please
the
bull
he
played
for
his
own
pleasure
not
the
bull
he
was
a
splendid
companion
hunter
was
rather
a
nonentity
his
chief
attraction
was
that
he
usually
had
the
last
bit
of
scandal
at
his
he
was
safe
to
be
consulted
on
any
point
of
school
politics
it
was
his
boast
that
he
had
sufficient
evidence
to
expel
half
the
fifteen
and
the
whole
eleven
at
this
time
gordon
found
school
life
inexpressibly
joyful
there
were
minor
troubles
but
they
were
few
the
only
thing
that
really
worried
him
was
corps
parade
this
infliction
occurred
once
every
week
and
for
two
hours
gordon
passed
through
hell
he
was
in
a
recruits
section
under
a
man
from
rogers
house
who
was
a
typical
product
of
his
house
he
was
oily
yellow
and
unpleasant
to
look
upon
he
also
loathed
gordon
there
was
a
feud
between
the
men
from
rogers
and
the
school
house
rogers
was
the
captain
in
command
of
the
corps
to
gordon
he
seemed
exactly
like
what
cicero
must
have
been
loud
contentious
smashing
down
pasteboard
castles
with
a
terrific
din
he
was
amazingly
arrogant
and
conceited
in
the
pulpit
and
on
the
parade
ground
he
was
in
his
element
the
school
house
had
for
years
been
notorious
for
their
slackness
on
parade
in
drill
and
musketry
competitions
they
had
invariably
come
out
bottom
and
rogers
hated
them
for
it
it
was
indeed
a
great
sight
to
see
the
school
house
half
company
at
work
everyone
was
fed
to
death
and
took
no
pains
to
hide
the
fact
once
rogers
had
said
to
the
house
phillips
form
up
your
men
facing
right
phillips
looked
round
at
them
thought
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
drawled
look
here
you
fellows
shove
round
there
and
the
subsequent
sarcastic
comment
was
quite
lost
on
him
he
was
a
good
forward
but
not
too
clever
he
was
proof
against
epigram
it
was
truly
a
noble
sight
to
see
lovelace
minor
come
on
parade
every
week
exactly
two
seconds
late
in
the
dead
silence
that
followed
the
thundered
parade
he
would
dash
through
the
school
gate
puffing
and
blowing
his
drum
knocking
against
his
equipment
his
hat
crooked
half
his
buttons
undone
he
would
barge
through
two
sections
rush
to
the
school
house
bang
his
rifle
on
the
ground
and
say
to
his
companion
in
a
stage
whisper
i
was
noticed
was
i
but
these
were
only
incidents
as
a
whole
everything
connected
with
the
corps
was
a
hell
upon
earth
field
days
consisted
of
a
long
march
a
sublime
a
speech
from
rogers
a
bad
tea
then
a
long
march
home
no
one
knew
what
was
happening
no
one
cared
it
was
a
sheer
waste
of
time
only
rogers
really
enjoyed
himself
then
suddenly
it
occurred
to
clarke
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
was
a
disgrace
to
the
house
he
had
just
been
made
a
and
determined
to
wake
things
up
he
made
a
long
speech
to
the
house
pointing
out
the
necessity
for
national
service
the
importance
of
militarism
and
its
effect
on
citizenship
he
finished
by
a
patriotic
outburst
telling
them
that
they
were
wearing
the
king
uniform
and
that
it
must
be
kept
clean
with
the
brass
badges
polished
the
house
was
mildly
interested
its
attitude
was
summed
up
in
turner
remark
the
king
uniform
will
have
to
go
buttonless
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
damned
if
i
waste
twopence
to
buy
a
rotten
bone
button
on
the
next
parade
however
clarke
inspected
the
company
half
the
house
had
to
call
him
the
next
morning
dressed
properly
at
seven
that
would
mean
getting
up
at
general
consternation
it
a
crying
scandal
said
lovelace
minor
if
i
had
not
been
reported
for
slacking
at
french
i
jolly
well
go
and
complain
to
the
chief
how
can
anyone
play
football
without
proper
sleep
gordon
laughed
from
the
depths
of
his
there
were
advantages
in
being
a
recruit
even
if
one
was
ordered
about
by
a
man
in
who
did
hunter
and
jeffries
raged
furiously
they
swore
that
they
would
not
turn
up
who
is
clarke
damn
his
eyes
to
take
on
the
privileges
of
a
it
a
house
tradition
that
no
one
tries
at
parade
overnight
hunter
was
very
full
of
rebellion
but
seven
saw
him
in
shining
brass
meekly
standing
before
clarke
who
examined
them
from
his
bed
with
an
electric
torch
but
jeffries
cut
he
was
ever
agin
the
government
he
got
six
his
tunic
was
clean
next
week
the
house
growled
and
cursed
inwardly
but
its
appearance
on
parade
was
very
different
clarke
was
a
man
there
is
nothing
so
as
to
watch
trouble
from
a
safe
distance
gordon
was
thoroughly
happy
mansell
cursed
heavily
every
monday
night
before
the
tuesday
parade
clarke
became
to
the
house
what
cromwell
was
to
ireland
even
the
feeble
davenham
thought
it
was
a
bit
thick
but
gordon
was
a
recruit
and
such
things
did
not
worry
him
life
was
just
then
amazingly
exciting
he
was
developing
into
quite
a
useful
forward
mansell
said
he
was
certain
for
a
place
in
the
house
thirds
side
he
was
high
up
in
form
and
there
was
a
good
chance
of
his
getting
a
prize
but
what
perhaps
counted
more
than
anything
else
was
the
fact
that
he
was
getting
a
position
in
the
house
prefects
had
ceased
to
ask
him
what
his
name
was
he
was
no
longer
a
nonentity
he
was
looked
on
as
a
coming
man
as
the
term
wore
on
the
thought
of
exams
brought
to
gordon
only
a
feeling
of
excitement
there
was
little
likelihood
of
disaster
there
was
the
certainty
of
a
good
struggle
for
the
first
place
between
himself
and
one
walford
a
dull
though
industrious
outhouse
individual
but
to
some
of
his
friends
exams
seemed
as
the
day
of
reckoning
lovelace
minor
was
frankly
at
his
wits
end
he
had
slacked
most
abominably
the
whole
term
he
had
prepared
none
of
his
books
and
his
neighbour
had
supplied
him
with
all
necessary
information
now
the
news
was
about
that
iv
b
was
going
to
sit
with
the
sixth
form
for
exams
terror
reigned
there
could
be
no
cribbing
under
the
chief
nose
jeffries
was
in
the
same
plight
but
he
was
a
philosopher
if
i
get
bottled
in
every
paper
he
said
it
will
only
mean
about
two
work
on
each
subject
but
if
i
am
going
to
know
enough
to
avoid
being
bottled
it
will
mean
a
good
eight
hours
work
at
each
subject
six
hours
wasted
on
each
in
these
times
of
bustle
it
ca
be
done
caruthers
pass
me
that
novel
on
the
second
shelf
lovelace
however
was
perturbed
and
set
out
to
prepare
himself
for
the
ordeal
but
his
was
a
temperament
that
forbade
application
on
any
subject
other
than
horse
racing
every
night
he
paced
up
and
down
the
study
passages
getting
hints
first
from
one
person
then
another
and
always
staying
for
a
talk
by
the
end
of
preparation
the
result
was
always
the
same
nothing
done
and
he
and
jeffries
both
spent
the
last
saturday
in
exactly
the
same
way
but
with
mansell
it
was
different
if
he
got
a
promotion
his
pater
had
promised
him
a
motor
bike
at
first
sight
this
seemed
impossible
hunter
in
fact
laid
a
hundred
to
one
against
his
chances
but
for
once
mansell
really
tried
at
something
besides
games
for
two
halls
he
worked
solidly
from
seven
till
ten
preparing
small
slips
of
paper
that
contained
all
the
notes
he
could
find
in
gordon
notebook
and
that
could
fit
conveniently
into
the
back
of
a
watch
everything
was
in
his
favour
claremont
was
taking
exams
the
first
paper
was
old
testament
history
mansell
looked
at
his
watch
repeatedly
but
suddenly
he
came
to
an
unexpected
question
he
endeavoured
to
extract
an
answer
from
the
man
on
his
right
claremont
spotted
him
well
mansell
if
i
ask
you
if
you
are
cribbing
i
know
you
will
deny
it
and
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
a
lie
but
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
talk
quite
so
loudly
any
ordinary
master
would
have
torn
up
the
boy
paper
but
claremont
was
getting
old
at
any
rate
for
the
rest
of
the
exams
mansell
relied
entirely
on
his
notes
the
greek
translation
paper
however
was
more
than
he
could
do
promotion
did
not
count
on
a
set
subject
but
only
on
english
and
latin
so
greek
had
gone
by
the
board
after
writing
the
most
amazing
nonsense
for
two
hours
mansell
decided
that
it
was
wiser
not
to
enter
into
competition
at
all
with
those
low
tricksters
who
had
prepared
their
work
he
showed
up
no
papers
at
all
next
day
claremont
corrected
the
papers
well
mansell
i
ca
find
your
paper
anywhere
i
showed
it
up
sir
well
i
am
sure
i
do
know
where
it
is
you
had
better
go
and
find
mr
douglas
and
ask
him
if
he
knows
anything
about
it
mr
douglas
was
the
mathematical
master
to
whom
all
marks
were
sent
he
added
them
up
and
made
out
the
orders
after
an
unnecessarily
long
interval
mansell
returned
i
am
sorry
sir
mr
douglas
has
not
seen
them
well
i
suppose
it
must
be
all
my
fault
i
shall
have
to
give
you
an
average
on
your
papers
which
strange
to
say
have
been
for
you
remarkably
good
mansell
was
averaged
sixth
for
the
paper
a
real
good
bluff
gives
more
pleasure
than
all
the
honest
exercises
of
one
life
put
together
there
was
laughter
in
no
study
that
evening
a
few
weeks
ago
gordon
would
have
been
horrified
at
such
a
thing
but
now
it
seemed
a
splendid
jest
he
would
not
have
cribbed
himself
he
preferred
to
beat
a
man
with
his
own
brains
though
mansell
would
have
protested
that
it
was
a
greater
effort
to
pit
one
brains
against
a
master
long
trained
in
spotting
tricks
than
against
some
scholar
the
public
school
system
at
any
rate
teaches
its
sons
the
art
of
framing
very
ingenious
theories
with
which
to
defend
their
faults
a
negative
virtue
perhaps
but
none
the
less
an
achievement
the
last
days
of
term
were
now
drawing
in
the
house
supper
was
only
a
few
days
off
and
the
holidays
very
close
everyone
was
glad
on
the
whole
to
have
finished
the
christmas
term
which
is
invariably
the
worst
of
the
three
and
this
year
it
had
not
been
improved
by
clarke
military
activities
and
the
feeling
of
unrest
that
overhung
the
doings
of
the
fifteen
because
of
lovelace
major
broils
with
the
bull
two
strong
men
both
wanted
their
own
way
on
the
whole
honours
were
even
though
if
anything
slightly
in
lovelace
favour
since
he
had
filled
up
the
scrum
with
a
school
house
forward
and
a
member
of
benson
a
small
and
rather
insignificant
house
instead
of
giving
the
colours
to
men
in
buller
but
next
term
there
would
be
fewer
rows
there
would
be
house
matches
and
each
house
captain
would
run
things
in
his
own
house
as
he
wished
the
school
captain
did
little
except
post
up
which
grounds
each
house
was
to
occupy
the
school
house
always
longed
for
the
easter
term
it
was
their
chance
of
showing
the
rest
of
the
school
what
they
were
made
of
as
they
were
slightly
bigger
than
any
other
house
they
claimed
the
honour
of
playing
the
three
best
of
the
outhouses
in
the
great
three
cock
house
match
for
the
senior
challenge
cup
this
year
with
lovelace
and
meredith
a
school
house
victory
was
looked
on
as
almost
certain
besides
this
big
event
there
were
the
two
cock
and
thirds
house
match
in
the
thirds
the
school
house
under
sixteen
house
side
played
against
the
two
best
of
the
outhouses
under
sixteen
sides
for
the
thirds
challenge
cup
and
in
the
two
cock
the
second
house
fifteen
that
is
the
house
fifteen
minus
those
with
first
and
second
fifteen
colours
played
the
two
best
of
the
outhouse
second
fifteens
for
the
junior
challenge
cup
the
results
of
these
last
two
matches
were
very
much
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
the
house
stood
a
fair
chance
but
the
general
opinion
was
that
buller
would
win
the
thirds
and
christy
a
house
that
was
full
of
average
players
who
were
too
slack
to
get
their
seconds
would
pull
off
the
two
cock
at
any
rate
there
would
be
no
lack
of
excitement
there
was
always
far
more
keenness
shown
about
house
matches
than
school
matches
a
fact
which
worried
buller
immensely
he
thought
everything
should
be
secondary
to
the
interests
of
fernhurst
on
the
last
saturday
of
the
term
there
was
the
house
supper
it
was
a
noble
affair
the
bloods
wore
evening
dress
even
the
untidiest
junior
oiled
his
hair
and
put
on
a
clean
collar
at
the
sixth
form
table
sat
the
chief
some
guests
lovelace
clarke
and
a
certain
ferguson
who
edited
fernhurst
school
and
was
to
propose
the
health
of
the
old
boys
of
whom
about
twenty
had
come
down
several
having
helped
to
defeat
the
school
by
twenty
points
to
sixteen
in
the
afternoon
never
had
so
much
food
been
seen
before
turner
had
boasted
that
he
always
went
into
training
a
week
before
the
event
so
as
to
enjoy
it
more
but
the
real
triumph
was
the
hot
punch
as
soon
as
dessert
had
begun
the
old
boys
trooped
out
and
brought
in
a
huge
steaming
bowl
of
punch
from
which
they
filled
all
the
glasses
gordon
did
not
like
it
much
it
seemed
very
hot
and
strong
but
everyone
else
seemed
to
jeffries
got
a
little
excited
then
speeches
followed
the
chief
proposed
the
fortune
of
the
house
clarke
answered
him
there
was
the
usual
applause
and
clapping
but
the
real
event
was
lovelace
speech
it
had
been
a
year
of
great
success
the
three
cock
had
been
lost
by
only
a
very
small
margin
the
two
cock
had
been
won
in
a
and
the
thirds
by
two
points
the
senior
cricket
and
the
sports
cup
had
also
been
won
it
was
very
nearly
a
record
year
lovelace
was
received
with
terrific
applause
he
congratulated
the
house
on
its
performance
he
mentioned
individual
names
each
was
the
signal
for
a
roar
of
cheering
and
then
at
the
end
he
said
and
now
i
have
a
message
to
the
house
from
the
old
boys
let
us
have
the
three
cock
cup
back
again
on
the
school
house
sideboard
it
is
the
place
where
it
should
be
and
that
the
place
where
we
are
going
to
put
it
gentlemen
the
three
cock
amid
a
deafening
noise
the
toast
was
drunk
and
a
voice
from
the
back
yelled
out
three
cheers
for
lovelace
his
health
too
was
drunk
and
they
sang
he
a
jolly
good
after
this
all
else
seemed
tame
ferguson
made
a
speech
that
was
meant
to
be
very
funny
but
rather
missed
fire
he
had
read
the
whole
of
the
evening
before
underlining
appropriate
aphorisms
but
to
the
average
boy
oscar
wilde
is
rather
luckily
perhaps
a
little
too
advanced
the
evening
finished
with
lang
everyone
stood
on
the
table
and
roared
himself
hoarse
the
score
in
damage
was
twenty
plates
broken
beyond
repair
sixteen
punch
glasses
in
fragments
fourteen
cracked
plates
two
broken
gas
mantles
when
the
revellers
had
departed
the
hall
looked
rather
gloomy
as
probably
nero
did
when
his
guests
fled
after
the
murder
of
britannicus
next
morning
there
was
early
service
for
communicants
but
the
school
house
was
entirely
pagan
hardly
a
man
went
on
sunday
there
was
a
great
feed
in
study
somehow
or
other
ten
people
got
packed
into
as
many
square
feet
of
room
gordon
was
there
and
mansell
of
course
collins
came
to
act
as
general
clown
fitzroy
a
small
friend
of
jeffries
sat
in
a
far
corner
looking
rather
uncomfortable
spence
carey
and
tiddy
made
up
the
number
the
last
were
quite
the
ordinary
public
school
type
their
conversation
ran
entirely
on
games
scandal
and
the
work
they
had
not
done
lovelace
was
mildly
bored
it
pretty
fair
rot
you
know
here
have
i
been
fair
sweating
away
at
the
exams
every
minute
of
my
time
and
jeffries
who
has
not
done
a
stroke
is
above
me
jeffries
was
bottom
but
one
oh
rotten
luck
said
mansell
you
should
do
like
me
old
fool
claremont
said
i
had
done
damned
well
he
hardly
put
it
that
way
came
from
gordon
but
i
believe
mansell
has
managed
more
or
less
to
deceive
the
examiners
oh
i
say
that
a
bit
thick
you
know
said
mansell
oh
damn
who
is
that
at
the
door
there
was
a
feeble
knock
come
in
shouted
at
least
six
voices
simultaneously
davenham
came
in
looking
rather
frightened
i
sorry
is
caruthers
in
here
yes
young
fellow
he
is
oh
caruthers
meredith
wants
you
damn
him
said
gordon
what
a
nuisance
these
prefects
are
very
unwillingly
he
got
up
and
strolled
upstairs
he
was
away
rather
a
long
time
after
twenty
minutes
absence
he
returned
rather
moodily
hullo
at
last
you
been
the
hell
of
a
long
time
said
hunter
what
did
he
want
oh
nothing
only
something
about
my
boxing
subscription
well
he
took
long
enough
about
it
i
must
say
was
that
all
of
course
cake
please
fitzroy
the
subject
was
dropped
but
just
before
chapel
jeffries
ran
into
gordon
in
the
cloister
look
here
caruthers
what
did
meredith
really
want
you
for
i
swear
i
wo
tell
anyone
oh
well
i
do
mind
you
knowing
you
know
what
meredith
is
well
i
mean
oh
you
know
the
usual
stuff
he
wanted
me
to
meet
him
out
for
a
walk
i
told
him
in
polite
language
to
go
to
the
good
lord
did
you
really
but
why
if
meredith
gets
fed
up
with
you
he
could
give
you
the
hell
of
a
time
oh
i
know
he
could
but
he
would
over
a
thing
like
that
damn
it
all
the
man
is
a
gentleman
of
course
he
is
but
all
the
same
he
is
a
blood
and
it
pays
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
them
oh
i
do
know
it
risky
and
well
i
think
the
whole
idea
is
damned
silly
nonsense
jeffries
looked
at
him
rather
curiously
yes
he
said
i
suppose
that
is
how
the
small
boy
always
looks
at
it
it
was
only
for
an
hour
or
so
however
that
gordon
let
this
affair
worry
him
the
holidays
were
only
hours
off
and
he
was
longing
to
hear
the
results
of
the
and
to
know
whether
he
had
a
prize
was
always
held
at
five
on
the
last
monday
and
the
afternoon
dragged
by
very
slowly
mansell
assumed
a
cheerful
indifference
he
thought
his
motor
bike
fairly
certain
rumour
had
it
there
were
going
to
be
at
least
twelve
promotions
into
the
lower
fifth
jeffries
and
lovelace
had
also
nothing
to
worry
about
there
was
little
doubt
as
to
their
positions
hunter
specialised
in
chemistry
and
had
done
no
examination
papers
but
for
gordon
the
suspense
was
intolerable
he
could
find
nothing
to
do
he
climbed
up
the
abbey
tower
and
wrote
his
name
on
the
big
hand
of
the
clock
he
roped
up
his
playbox
tipped
the
school
porter
and
still
there
was
an
hour
and
a
half
to
put
in
disconsolately
he
wandered
down
town
he
strolled
into
gisson
the
school
it
contained
nothing
but
the
home
university
library
series
and
numerous
everymans
it
was
just
like
his
first
day
over
again
but
at
last
five
came
and
he
sat
with
his
four
friends
at
the
back
of
the
big
schoolroom
he
grew
more
and
more
tired
of
hearing
the
lists
of
the
second
and
third
forms
read
out
what
interest
did
he
take
in
the
doings
of
pappenheim
and
guttridge
tertius
iv
a
was
reached
at
length
the
list
was
read
from
the
bottom
not
placed
hunter
slowly
the
names
were
read
out
the
single
figures
were
now
reached
mansell
term
work
eighteen
one
combined
order
four
this
difference
of
position
caused
a
titter
to
run
round
among
those
of
the
school
house
who
knew
the
cause
of
it
the
third
name
and
then
the
second
was
reached
caruthers
term
work
one
three
combined
order
one
term
prize
caruthers
mansell
the
latter
performance
was
the
signal
for
an
uproarious
outburst
of
applause
in
which
laughter
played
a
large
part
there
was
still
more
merriment
when
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
got
as
a
prize
as
he
crudely
put
it
what
the
bloody
hell
does
it
mean
gordon
got
the
by
malleson
both
books
now
repose
as
do
most
prizes
in
the
owners
unread
congrats
mansell
old
fellow
yelled
lovelace
minor
as
the
school
poured
out
at
the
end
of
the
glorious
what
a
school
house
triumph
yes
you
know
said
mansell
but
it
does
seem
quite
fair
and
i
am
damned
if
i
want
this
book
it
looks
the
most
utter
rot
i
say
shall
i
give
it
to
that
little
kid
in
buller
i
forget
his
name
who
was
second
he
looks
a
bit
upset
shall
i
i
say
do
be
a
silly
fool
mansell
said
lovelace
major
who
happened
to
overhear
the
conversation
you
just
got
the
only
prize
you
ever
likely
to
get
for
work
stick
on
to
it
the
rest
of
the
day
was
pure
unalloyed
joy
to
gordon
he
rushed
off
after
tea
to
wire
the
news
home
then
he
sat
in
the
gallery
and
listened
to
the
concert
he
had
expected
to
enjoy
it
rather
but
the
seats
were
uncomfortable
the
music
too
classical
and
he
soon
stopped
paying
any
attention
to
the
choir
and
began
a
long
argument
with
collins
as
to
the
composition
of
the
two
cock
scrum
the
next
morning
as
the
train
steamed
out
of
fernhurst
and
he
lay
back
in
the
carriage
smoking
a
cigarette
outwardly
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
inwardly
with
the
timid
nervousness
of
a
novice
he
reflected
that
in
spite
of
the
rev
rogers
school
was
a
pretty
decent
sort
of
place
chapter
iv
new
faces
i
say
it
true
lovelace
major
has
left
good
lord
no
is
it
he
not
on
the
house
list
i
heard
he
passed
into
the
army
at
last
i
wonder
who
he
was
sitting
next
and
we
shall
have
that
silly
ass
armour
captain
of
the
house
ye
gods
a
small
crowd
had
gathered
in
front
of
the
studies
on
the
first
night
of
the
easter
term
consternation
reigned
the
almost
impossible
had
happened
lovelace
major
had
passed
into
sandhurst
at
his
fifth
attempt
and
armour
would
take
his
place
as
house
captain
it
was
a
disaster
armour
was
doubtless
a
most
worthy
fellow
a
thoroughly
honest
forward
but
he
had
no
personality
when
he
passed
by
fags
did
not
suddenly
stop
talking
as
they
did
when
clarke
or
meredith
rolled
past
them
the
term
before
he
had
not
even
been
a
house
prefect
the
three
cock
which
had
once
seemed
such
a
certainty
now
became
a
forlorn
hope
it
rotten
said
lovelace
minor
that
night
in
the
dormitory
my
brother
did
think
he
had
the
very
ghost
of
a
chance
of
passing
mucked
it
up
four
times
running
only
the
silly
ass
had
done
both
the
unseens
with
the
bull
the
week
before
and
he
was
too
damned
slack
to
alter
them
and
write
them
down
wrong
he
always
was
an
ass
my
brother
everyone
was
sorry
even
the
bull
regarded
him
with
a
sort
of
indulgent
sentimentality
he
never
saw
very
much
good
in
a
school
house
captain
as
long
as
he
was
there
but
as
soon
as
he
left
all
his
faults
were
forgotten
and
virtues
that
he
had
never
possessed
were
flung
at
him
in
profusion
the
result
was
that
the
bull
said
to
the
school
house
captain
of
each
generation
i
have
had
more
trouble
with
you
than
any
fernhurst
boy
i
have
ever
met
you
ca
see
beyond
the
length
of
your
own
see
big
see
the
importance
of
fernhurst
and
the
insignificance
of
yourself
but
no
one
was
more
sorry
than
armour
he
did
not
want
responsibility
he
had
not
sought
for
it
he
wished
to
have
fought
in
the
school
house
battles
as
a
private
not
as
an
officer
he
loved
the
house
and
longed
for
its
success
and
trembled
to
think
that
he
might
ruin
its
chances
by
a
weak
and
vacillating
captaincy
moreover
he
felt
that
he
had
no
one
to
back
him
up
meredith
robey
and
simonds
the
other
members
of
the
first
fifteen
in
the
house
were
all
grousing
and
wondering
how
large
a
score
the
outhouses
would
run
up
in
the
three
cock
no
one
placed
any
confidence
in
his
abilities
he
was
entirely
alone
the
next
day
was
pouring
wet
the
ground
was
under
water
most
house
captains
would
have
sent
their
houses
for
a
run
but
armour
wanted
to
make
his
start
as
early
as
possible
he
could
bear
to
delay
that
afternoon
the
probable
thirds
side
played
against
the
rest
of
the
house
with
the
exception
of
the
second
colours
armour
had
never
felt
so
nervous
before
it
was
actually
the
first
time
he
had
refereed
on
a
game
jeffries
was
captain
of
the
thirds
and
kicked
off
it
was
of
course
a
scrappy
game
on
such
a
day
good
football
was
impossible
the
outsides
hardly
touched
the
ball
once
but
the
forwards
covered
in
mud
from
head
to
foot
had
their
full
share
of
work
jeffries
was
ubiquitous
he
led
the
grovel
as
the
scrum
was
called
at
fernhurst
and
kept
it
together
gordon
had
very
little
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
but
he
did
one
or
two
dribbles
and
managed
to
collar
mansell
the
only
time
he
looked
like
getting
away
lovelace
minor
who
played
had
nothing
to
do
except
stop
forward
rushes
was
kicked
all
over
his
body
got
very
cold
and
never
had
a
chance
once
he
was
utterly
miserable
the
whole
hour
all
this
was
in
favour
of
armour
he
knew
nothing
about
work
but
he
had
played
forward
ever
since
he
had
gone
to
the
fernhurst
preparatory
at
ten
years
of
age
and
could
always
spot
the
worker
and
the
slacker
which
lovelace
major
never
could
on
the
whole
taking
a
house
game
was
not
so
terrifying
after
all
by
he
had
forgotten
his
nervousness
in
his
excitement
at
watching
how
his
side
was
going
to
shape
you
know
i
do
think
armour
so
rotten
as
people
said
he
would
be
said
gordon
as
they
came
up
after
the
game
i
thought
he
was
all
right
oh
yes
he
not
so
bad
but
he
does
not
seem
much
when
you
shove
him
next
to
lovelace
major
well
you
know
said
jeffries
he
does
know
something
about
forward
play
which
i
am
damned
if
lovelace
did
perhaps
so
but
all
the
same
lovelace
was
the
man
to
win
matches
mansell
was
an
outside
and
loved
dash
and
brilliance
but
the
forwards
were
not
sorry
to
have
someone
in
command
who
understood
them
armour
had
begun
well
there
are
still
people
who
will
maintain
that
the
ideal
schoolboy
in
school
hours
thinks
only
about
vergil
and
sophocles
and
in
the
field
concentrates
entirely
on
drop
kicks
and
yorkers
but
that
boy
does
not
exist
and
in
the
easter
term
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
anything
but
house
matches
those
who
were
in
the
power
of
some
form
martinet
had
a
terrible
time
this
term
but
gordon
and
mansell
found
themselves
safely
at
rest
in
claremont
form
and
greek
set
and
made
up
their
minds
just
to
stay
there
and
do
only
enough
work
to
avoid
being
bottled
for
the
lower
fifth
was
certainly
the
refuge
of
many
mariners
pat
johnstone
had
laboriously
worked
up
from
the
bottom
form
led
on
only
by
the
hope
that
one
day
he
would
reach
b
and
there
repose
at
the
back
of
the
room
living
his
last
terms
in
peace
ruddock
had
once
set
out
with
high
hopes
of
reaching
the
sixth
his
first
term
he
had
won
a
divinity
prize
in
the
shell
but
under
claremont
he
had
discovered
the
truth
learnt
long
ago
in
the
land
of
lotus
eaters
that
slumber
is
more
sweet
than
toil
the
back
benches
of
that
room
were
strewn
with
shattered
hopes
small
intelligent
scholars
came
up
and
passed
by
on
their
way
to
balliol
scholarships
but
the
faces
at
the
back
of
the
room
remained
terribly
somnolent
and
happy
a
certain
banbury
had
been
there
for
three
years
and
had
earned
the
nickname
of
old
father
time
and
mansell
too
swore
he
would
enrol
himself
with
the
lost
legion
while
even
gordon
said
that
nothing
would
shift
him
from
there
for
at
least
a
year
claremont
had
many
strange
ideas
the
most
striking
of
which
was
the
belief
that
boys
felt
a
passionate
love
for
poetry
the
average
boy
has
probably
read
all
the
poetry
he
will
ever
read
terms
before
he
ever
reaches
the
fifth
form
by
the
time
he
is
in
shell
he
has
learnt
to
appreciate
kipling
the
more
choice
bits
of
and
a
few
passages
in
shakespeare
if
english
literature
were
taught
differently
if
he
were
led
by
stages
from
macaulay
to
scott
from
byron
to
rossetti
he
might
perhaps
appreciate
the
splendid
heritage
of
song
but
as
it
is
swung
straight
from
to
the
to
the
he
finds
the
shy
beauty
of
keats
most
unutterable
nonsense
claremont
however
thought
otherwise
and
ran
his
form
accordingly
in
repetition
this
was
especially
noticeable
kennedy
a
small
boy
with
glasses
who
was
always
would
nervously
mumble
through
henry
v
speech
they
always
learnt
shakespeare
in
an
accurate
but
totally
uninspired
way
mansell
would
stand
at
the
back
of
the
form
and
blunder
out
blank
verse
much
of
which
was
his
own
and
little
of
which
was
shakespeare
but
which
certainly
sounded
most
impressive
well
kennedy
claremont
would
say
you
certainly
know
your
words
very
well
but
i
ca
bear
the
way
you
say
them
five
out
of
twenty
mansell
you
evidently
have
made
little
attempt
to
learn
your
repetition
at
all
but
i
love
your
fervour
one
so
rarely
finds
anyone
really
affected
by
the
passion
of
poetry
fifteen
out
of
twenty
during
his
two
years
in
the
lower
fifth
mansell
never
once
spent
more
than
five
minutes
learning
his
rep
yet
on
no
occasion
did
he
get
less
than
twelve
out
of
twenty
a
bare
outline
was
required
a
loud
voice
supplied
the
rest
in
this
form
it
was
that
gordon
first
began
to
crib
he
did
not
do
it
to
get
marks
he
merely
wished
to
avoid
being
bottled
some
headmasters
and
the
writers
to
boy
own
draw
lurid
pictures
of
the
bully
who
by
cribbing
steals
the
prize
from
the
poor
innocent
who
looks
up
every
word
in
a
big
liddell
and
scott
but
such
people
do
exist
no
one
ever
cribbed
in
order
to
get
a
prize
they
crib
from
mere
slackness
mansell
exam
prize
in
iv
a
is
about
the
only
instance
of
a
prize
won
by
cribbing
besides
cribbing
is
an
art
ruddock
for
instance
when
he
used
to
go
on
to
translate
was
accustomed
to
take
up
his
vergil
in
one
hand
and
his
bohn
in
the
other
what
is
that
other
book
ruddock
claremont
asked
once
some
notes
sir
was
the
perfectly
truthful
answer
ruddock
was
moreover
an
altruist
he
always
worked
for
the
good
of
his
one
day
when
mansell
was
bungling
most
abominably
with
his
euripides
he
flung
his
bohn
along
the
desk
mansell
picked
it
up
propped
it
in
front
of
him
and
read
it
off
claremont
never
noticed
this
was
the
start
of
a
great
system
of
combination
everyone
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
paid
twopence
to
the
general
account
with
which
ruddock
bought
some
steps
to
accurate
as
each
person
went
on
to
translate
the
book
was
passed
to
him
and
he
read
straight
out
of
it
the
translating
was
in
consequence
always
of
a
remarkably
high
standard
claremont
never
understood
why
examinations
always
proved
the
signal
for
a
general
collapse
history
however
was
a
subject
that
had
long
been
a
worry
to
the
form
dates
are
irrevocable
facts
and
can
not
be
altered
they
must
be
learnt
at
one
time
when
claremont
said
shut
your
book
i
will
ask
a
few
questions
everyone
shut
their
latin
grammars
loudly
and
kept
their
history
books
open
but
this
was
rather
too
obvious
a
ruse
claremont
began
to
spot
it
something
had
to
be
done
it
would
be
an
insult
to
expect
any
member
of
the
form
to
prepare
a
lesson
it
was
gordon
who
finally
devised
a
plan
please
sir
he
said
one
day
do
you
think
we
should
find
history
much
more
interesting
if
we
could
bring
in
maps
well
perhaps
it
would
said
claremont
sleepily
i
am
sure
the
form
is
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
kind
thought
anyone
who
wants
to
may
bring
in
a
map
next
day
everyone
had
found
a
huge
atlas
which
he
propped
up
on
the
desk
and
which
completely
hid
everything
except
the
student
actual
head
there
was
now
no
fear
of
an
open
book
being
spotted
it
was
so
very
simple
to
shut
it
when
claremont
began
to
walk
about
and
besides
it
made
the
lesson
so
much
more
interesting
and
so
gordon
and
mansell
were
able
to
discuss
football
the
whole
of
evening
hall
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
and
yet
get
quite
a
respectable
report
the
interest
in
the
thirds
was
now
becoming
intense
as
was
expected
buller
easily
beat
all
the
outhouses
with
claremont
house
as
claremont
house
had
once
been
the
great
athletic
house
but
when
a
house
master
takes
but
little
interest
in
a
performances
that
house
is
apt
to
get
stale
and
soon
became
a
name
for
mediocrity
as
a
house
it
was
like
b
a
happy
land
where
no
one
worried
about
anything
and
it
was
quite
safe
to
smoke
in
the
studies
on
a
sunday
afternoon
a
side
made
up
of
two
houses
that
had
never
played
together
before
was
bound
to
lack
the
combination
of
a
side
that
had
played
together
for
several
weeks
but
the
school
house
was
always
playing
against
superior
weight
and
strength
and
more
than
once
had
found
itself
unable
to
sustain
their
efforts
and
after
leading
up
to
went
clean
to
pieces
in
the
last
ten
minutes
it
is
pretty
hard
to
hold
a
grovel
several
stones
heavier
for
over
an
hour
and
this
year
even
armour
was
a
little
doubtful
about
the
lightness
of
his
side
to
gordon
and
jeffries
of
course
defeat
seemed
impossible
last
year
jeffries
had
played
in
a
winning
side
and
gordon
had
yet
to
see
the
house
lose
a
match
but
mansell
smiled
sadly
he
had
played
in
a
good
many
losing
sides
gordon
dreamed
football
night
and
day
he
saw
himself
securing
wonderful
tries
and
bringing
off
amazing
collars
when
all
seemed
lost
but
all
his
hopes
were
doomed
to
disappointment
two
days
before
the
game
he
slipped
coming
downstairs
fell
with
his
wrist
under
him
and
with
his
arm
in
splints
and
sling
had
to
watch
from
the
an
outhouse
victory
of
ten
points
to
nothing
the
usual
thing
happened
the
house
was
just
not
strong
enough
jeffries
played
a
great
game
and
fought
an
uphill
fight
splendidly
lovelace
only
missed
a
drop
goal
by
inches
fletcher
an
undisciplined
forward
did
great
damage
till
warned
by
the
referee
but
weight
told
and
during
the
whole
of
the
last
half
the
house
were
penned
in
their
while
the
school
got
over
twice
very
miserably
the
house
sat
down
to
tea
that
evening
it
added
insult
to
injury
when
an
impertinent
fag
from
walked
in
in
the
middle
and
demanded
the
cup
armour
managed
to
keep
his
temper
but
that
fag
did
not
forget
for
weeks
the
booting
gordon
gave
him
the
next
day
still
it
was
a
poor
revenge
for
a
lost
cup
whatever
little
chance
there
had
ever
been
of
gordon
getting
a
place
in
the
two
cock
was
of
course
quite
destroyed
by
his
accident
the
doctor
said
he
ought
not
to
play
again
for
at
least
three
weeks
and
so
it
was
that
as
far
as
football
was
concerned
gordon
found
himself
rather
out
of
it
all
his
friends
were
in
the
thick
of
everything
mansell
was
captain
of
the
two
cock
jeffries
was
leading
the
scrum
hunter
was
being
tried
as
scrum
half
and
lovelace
was
in
training
as
a
reserve
he
alone
was
doing
nothing
for
a
few
days
the
afternoons
seemed
unbearably
long
but
gordon
had
a
remarkable
gift
for
adapting
himself
to
circumstances
and
he
had
very
little
difficulty
in
striking
up
new
acquaintances
so
far
he
had
had
very
little
to
do
with
those
outside
his
actual
set
with
the
majority
of
the
house
he
was
hardly
on
speaking
terms
and
of
archie
fletcher
he
knew
little
except
the
name
archie
fletcher
was
a
great
person
great
in
fact
was
the
only
adjective
that
really
fitted
him
he
had
only
two
real
objects
in
life
one
was
to
get
his
house
cap
the
other
was
to
enjoy
himself
and
his
love
of
pleasure
usually
took
the
form
of
ragging
masters
ragging
with
him
did
not
consist
in
mere
spasmodic
episodes
of
bravado
which
usually
ended
in
a
beating
he
had
reduced
it
to
a
science
it
was
to
him
the
supreme
art
at
present
he
was
suffering
from
a
kick
on
the
knee
which
he
had
received
in
the
thirds
and
he
and
gordon
found
themselves
constantly
thrown
together
archie
no
one
ever
called
him
anything
else
was
a
splendid
companion
he
had
an
enormous
repertoire
of
anecdotes
which
he
was
never
tired
of
telling
and
every
one
finished
in
exactly
the
same
way
believe
me
caruthers
some
rag
oh
a
great
man
forsooth
was
archie
he
had
cynically
examined
every
master
with
whom
he
had
anything
to
do
picked
him
to
pieces
found
out
his
faults
and
then
played
on
his
weaknesses
sometimes
however
he
went
a
little
too
far
on
one
occasion
he
was
doing
chemistry
with
a
certain
jenks
a
very
fiery
little
man
who
really
believed
in
the
educational
value
of
stinks
so
did
archie
it
gave
him
scope
to
exercise
his
genius
for
playing
the
fool
but
this
day
he
overstepped
the
bounds
in
the
distance
he
saw
blake
his
pet
aversion
carefully
working
out
an
experiment
a
piece
of
glass
tubing
was
at
hand
jenks
was
not
looking
archie
fixed
the
tube
to
the
waterspout
turned
the
tap
a
cascade
of
o
rose
in
the
air
and
fell
on
blake
apparatus
there
was
a
crash
of
falling
glass
jenks
spun
round
oh
is
that
you
fletcher
you
stupid
fellow
come
over
here
i
shall
have
to
beat
you
now
then
where
my
cane
gone
oh
then
i
shall
have
to
use
some
rubber
tubing
stoop
down
stoop
down
laboriously
archie
bent
down
jenks
bent
a
piece
of
tubing
double
its
length
was
hardly
a
foot
and
gave
archie
a
feeble
blow
it
could
not
possibly
have
hurt
him
but
the
victim
leapt
in
the
air
clutching
the
seat
of
his
trousers
oh
he
screamed
oh
sir
oh
sir
you
have
hurt
me
sir
you
are
so
strong
sir
oh
then
you
are
coward
too
are
you
said
the
delighted
jenks
stoop
down
again
stoop
down
the
form
rocked
with
laughter
archie
received
four
strokes
in
all
and
after
each
he
went
through
the
same
performance
jenks
thought
himself
a
second
hercules
he
repeated
the
story
in
the
common
room
archie
repeated
it
also
in
the
studies
believe
me
you
fellows
some
rag
a
great
man
and
after
gordon
own
heart
on
a
bleak
rainy
afternoon
gordon
and
fletcher
watched
the
overwhelming
defeat
of
the
house
in
the
two
cock
the
score
was
over
thirty
points
mansell
played
only
moderately
jeffries
was
off
his
game
a
gloom
settled
down
over
the
house
everyone
became
peevish
and
discontented
it
was
said
that
the
great
days
of
house
footer
were
over
to
lose
both
the
thirds
and
the
two
cock
was
a
disgrace
no
one
expected
anything
but
a
rout
in
the
three
cock
there
were
bets
in
the
as
to
whether
the
score
would
be
under
fifty
interest
centred
entirely
on
who
would
get
their
house
caps
with
lovelace
away
the
line
would
be
innocuous
the
forwards
always
had
been
weak
the
house
were
bad
losers
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
victories
chapter
v
emerging
jeffries
was
pretty
hot
stuff
was
he
good
lord
yes
if
he
plays
half
as
well
as
that
in
the
three
cock
he
get
his
house
cap
it
was
just
after
tea
mansell
was
lying
back
in
an
with
his
feet
on
the
table
he
was
dead
tired
after
a
strenuous
game
gordon
was
sitting
on
the
table
hunter
reclined
in
the
window
seat
where
is
he
by
the
way
said
gordon
i
did
see
him
in
to
tea
oh
i
believe
someone
asked
him
out
is
he
rather
a
pal
of
the
jacobs
in
cheap
street
i
heard
that
there
was
a
bit
of
a
row
on
said
hunter
i
quite
make
out
what
about
oh
by
jove
that
him
jeffries
voice
was
heard
down
the
passage
mansell
a
voice
answered
him
here
no
jeffries
was
heard
running
upstairs
he
entered
looking
very
dejected
hullo
cheer
up
shouted
mansell
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
run
like
that
after
this
afternoon
game
where
you
been
i
say
i
in
the
deuce
of
a
row
there
was
a
shriek
of
laughter
jeffries
was
always
in
a
row
and
he
always
exaggerated
its
importance
do
laugh
it
no
damned
joke
i
got
bunked
silence
suddenly
fell
on
the
group
but
what
the
hell
have
you
been
doing
chief
found
out
all
about
me
and
fitzroy
and
i
got
to
go
but
i
never
thought
there
was
really
anything
in
that
said
gordon
i
thought
oh
well
there
was
i
know
i
an
awful
swine
and
all
that
oh
pretty
damnable
and
the
three
cock
too
i
believe
i
should
have
got
my
house
cap
i
was
so
dusty
and
i
heard
armour
say
as
he
came
off
the
field
damn
what
the
bloody
hell
does
it
matter
what
armour
said
it
over
now
i
just
got
across
for
a
minute
to
see
you
men
i
said
i
wanted
a
book
lord
i
ca
believe
it
when
he
stopped
speaking
there
was
again
a
dead
silence
none
of
the
three
had
been
brought
face
to
face
with
such
a
tragedy
before
never
gordon
thought
had
the
greek
idea
of
nemesis
seemed
so
strong
hunter
broke
the
silence
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
do
know
i
shall
go
home
and
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
to
france
or
germany
or
perhaps
some
crammer
i
do
know
or
care
it
bound
to
be
pretty
rotten
he
half
smiled
my
god
and
it
damned
unfair
mansell
said
suddenly
there
are
jolly
few
of
us
here
any
better
than
you
and
look
at
the
bloods
every
one
of
them
as
fast
as
the
devil
and
you
have
to
go
just
because
oh
it
damned
unfair
then
jeffries
wild
anger
the
anger
that
had
made
him
so
brilliant
an
athlete
burst
out
unfair
yes
that
the
right
word
it
is
unfair
who
made
me
what
i
am
but
fernhurst
two
years
ago
i
came
here
as
innocent
as
caruthers
there
never
knew
anything
fernhurst
taught
me
everything
fernhurst
made
me
worship
games
and
think
that
they
alone
mattered
and
everything
else
could
go
to
the
deuce
i
heard
men
say
about
bloods
whose
lives
were
an
open
scandal
it
all
right
they
can
play
football
i
thought
it
was
all
right
too
fernhurst
made
me
think
it
was
and
now
fernhurst
that
has
made
me
what
i
am
turns
round
and
says
are
not
fit
to
be
a
member
of
this
great
school
and
i
have
to
go
oh
it
fair
is
it
he
dropped
exhausted
into
a
chair
after
a
pause
he
went
on
oh
well
it
no
use
grousing
i
suppose
if
one
hits
length
balls
on
the
middle
stump
over
square
leg
head
one
must
run
the
risk
of
being
bowled
and
i
did
believe
in
sticking
in
and
doing
nothing
on
or
get
out
and
well
i
got
out
he
laughed
rather
hysterically
again
silence
slowly
jeffries
got
up
well
you
men
he
shook
hands
as
he
opened
the
door
he
paused
for
a
second
laughed
to
himself
oh
it
funny
bloody
funny
he
murmured
not
fit
for
fernhurst
bloody
funny
he
laughed
again
bitterly
the
door
closed
slowly
jeffries
footsteps
could
be
heard
on
the
stairs
they
grew
fainter
the
door
leading
to
the
chief
side
of
the
house
slammed
down
the
study
passage
a
gramophone
struck
up
was
a
in
study
there
was
an
awful
stillness
that
evening
on
the
way
down
to
supper
gordon
overheard
armour
say
to
meredith
what
a
fool
that
man
jeffries
is
getting
bunked
and
mucking
up
the
grovel
damned
ass
the
man
is
meredith
agreed
gordon
did
care
very
much
just
now
about
the
result
of
a
house
match
he
had
lost
a
friend
armour
had
lost
a
cog
in
a
machine
as
was
expected
the
three
cock
proved
a
terribly
game
the
house
played
pluckily
and
for
the
first
half
kept
the
score
down
to
eight
points
but
during
the
last
twenty
minutes
it
was
quite
impossible
to
keep
out
the
strong
outhouse
combination
the
side
became
demoralised
and
went
absolutely
to
pieces
armour
did
not
give
a
single
house
cap
after
the
three
cock
there
was
a
period
of
four
weeks
during
which
the
best
athletes
trained
for
the
sports
while
the
rest
of
the
school
played
hockey
it
was
generally
considered
a
sort
of
holiday
after
the
stress
of
house
matches
usually
it
served
its
purpose
well
but
for
the
welfare
of
the
house
this
year
it
was
utterly
disastrous
the
whole
house
was
in
a
highly
strung
discontented
state
it
had
nothing
to
work
for
it
had
only
failures
to
look
back
upon
the
result
was
a
general
opposition
to
authority
for
a
week
or
so
there
was
a
continuous
row
going
on
in
the
studies
were
broken
chairs
were
smashed
nearly
every
day
one
or
other
member
of
the
house
was
hauled
before
the
chief
for
trouble
of
some
sort
but
things
did
not
reach
a
real
head
till
one
night
in
hall
just
before
palm
sunday
there
was
a
lecture
for
the
sixth
form
armour
was
taking
hall
and
the
only
prefect
in
the
studies
was
sandham
who
had
a
headache
and
had
got
leave
off
the
lecture
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
good
news
to
spread
round
the
studies
that
only
the
cockroach
was
about
the
first
sign
of
trouble
was
a
continual
sound
of
opening
doors
archie
was
rushing
round
stirring
up
strife
then
there
came
a
sound
of
many
voices
from
the
entrance
of
the
studies
where
were
the
fire
hose
and
the
gas
meter
suddenly
the
gas
was
turned
out
throughout
the
whole
building
and
pandemonium
broke
out
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
tumult
made
by
a
whole
house
that
was
inspired
by
only
one
idea
the
desire
to
make
a
noise
the
voice
of
sandham
rose
in
a
wail
over
and
again
above
the
uproar
but
it
was
pitch
dark
he
could
see
none
of
the
offenders
then
all
at
once
there
was
peace
again
the
lights
went
up
and
everyone
was
quietly
working
in
his
study
it
had
been
admirably
worked
out
archie
was
some
organiser
for
the
time
being
the
matter
ended
but
in
a
day
or
two
rumours
of
the
rebellion
had
reached
clarke
strong
steps
had
to
be
taken
and
clarke
was
not
the
man
to
shirk
his
duty
that
evening
after
prayers
he
got
up
and
addressed
the
house
i
have
been
told
that
two
nights
ago
when
i
was
absent
there
was
a
most
unseemly
uproar
in
the
studies
i
am
not
going
into
details
you
all
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
i
want
anyone
who
assisted
in
the
disturbance
to
stand
up
there
was
not
a
move
the
idea
that
the
public
school
boy
code
of
honour
forces
him
to
own
up
at
once
is
entirely
erroneous
boys
only
own
up
when
they
are
bound
to
be
found
out
they
are
not
quixotic
well
then
as
no
one
has
spoken
i
shall
have
to
take
forcible
measures
everyone
above
iv
a
for
the
lower
school
did
their
preparation
in
the
will
do
me
a
hundred
lines
every
day
till
the
end
of
the
term
thank
you
that
night
there
was
loud
cursing
clarke
had
hardly
a
supporter
the
other
prefects
with
the
exception
of
ferguson
who
did
not
count
for
much
in
the
way
of
things
agreed
with
meredith
who
said
if
the
cockroach
ca
keep
order
how
can
clarke
expect
there
should
be
absolute
quiet
it
the
chief
fault
for
making
such
prefects
damned
silly
i
call
it
the
term
did
not
end
without
a
further
row
there
had
been
from
time
immemorial
a
system
by
which
corps
clothes
were
common
property
everyone
flung
them
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
tuesday
after
parade
the
matron
sorted
them
out
after
a
fashion
but
most
people
on
the
next
tuesday
afternoon
found
themselves
with
two
tunics
and
no
trousers
or
two
hats
and
only
one
puttee
but
no
one
cared
the
person
who
had
two
tunics
flung
one
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
then
went
in
search
of
some
spare
trousers
everyone
was
clothed
somehow
in
the
end
there
was
always
enough
clothes
to
go
round
there
was
bound
to
be
at
least
ten
people
who
had
got
leave
off
it
was
a
convenient
socialism
but
one
day
fitzmorris
turned
up
on
parade
in
a
pair
of
footer
shorts
a
straw
hat
and
a
first
eleven
blazer
he
was
a
bit
of
a
nut
and
finding
his
clothes
gone
went
on
strangely
garbed
merely
out
of
curiosity
to
see
what
would
happen
a
good
deal
did
happen
as
soon
as
the
corps
was
dismissed
there
was
a
clothes
inspection
and
the
garments
of
fitzmorris
were
found
distributed
on
various
bodies
clarke
again
addressed
the
house
anyone
in
future
discovered
wearing
anyone
else
clothes
would
be
severely
dealt
with
but
the
house
was
not
to
be
outdone
every
single
name
was
erased
from
every
single
piece
of
clothing
identification
was
impossible
fitzmorris
turned
up
at
the
next
parade
with
one
puttee
missing
and
a
tunic
that
could
not
meet
across
his
chest
there
was
another
inspection
but
this
time
it
revealed
nothing
everyone
swore
that
he
was
wearing
his
own
clothes
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
he
was
not
for
the
time
clarke
was
discomfited
fitzmorris
set
out
on
his
easter
holidays
contented
with
himself
and
the
world
in
the
firm
belief
that
he
had
thoroughly
squashed
that
blighter
clarke
the
head
of
the
house
returned
to
his
lonely
home
on
the
moors
very
thoughtful
the
next
term
would
be
his
last
on
the
first
sunday
of
the
summer
term
the
chief
preached
a
sermon
the
effect
of
which
gordon
never
forgot
he
was
speaking
on
the
subject
of
memory
and
remorse
it
may
be
in
a
few
months
he
said
it
may
be
not
for
three
or
four
years
but
at
any
rate
before
very
long
you
will
each
one
of
you
have
to
stand
on
the
threshold
of
life
and
looking
back
you
will
have
to
decide
whether
you
have
made
the
best
of
your
fernhurst
days
for
a
few
moments
i
ask
you
to
imagine
that
it
is
your
last
day
at
school
how
will
it
feel
if
you
have
to
look
back
and
think
only
of
shattered
hopes
of
bright
unfulfilled
promises
your
last
day
is
bound
to
be
one
of
infinite
pathos
but
to
the
pathos
of
human
sorrow
there
is
no
need
to
add
the
pathos
of
failure
oh
i
know
you
are
many
of
you
saying
to
yourselves
is
heaps
of
time
we
enjoy
ourselves
while
we
have
the
chance
it
is
not
for
so
very
long
no
you
are
right
there
it
is
not
for
so
very
long
it
is
only
a
few
hours
before
you
will
have
to
weigh
in
the
balance
the
good
and
the
bad
you
have
done
during
your
fernhurst
days
for
some
of
you
it
will
be
in
a
few
weeks
but
for
the
youngest
of
you
it
can
not
be
more
than
a
very
few
years
let
me
beg
each
of
you
the
sermon
followed
on
traditional
lines
almost
subconsciously
gordon
rose
with
the
others
to
sing
behold
us
with
thy
what
would
it
feel
like
to
him
if
this
were
his
last
sunday
and
he
had
to
own
that
his
school
career
were
a
failure
he
sat
quite
quiet
in
his
study
thinking
for
a
long
time
afterwards
he
had
a
study
alone
this
term
in
the
big
study
that
it
has
ever
been
the
privilege
of
the
head
of
the
house
to
own
clarke
also
sat
very
silent
he
was
nerving
himself
for
a
great
struggle
to
the
average
individual
the
summer
term
is
anything
but
the
heaven
it
is
usually
imagined
to
be
the
footer
man
hates
it
the
fag
has
to
field
all
day
on
a
house
game
and
always
goes
in
last
there
is
early
school
in
some
houses
there
are
no
hot
baths
on
the
first
day
the
studies
are
loud
with
murmurs
of
oh
this
rotten
summer
term
no
spare
time
and
cricket
awful
for
fernhurst
was
primarily
a
footer
school
buller
had
captained
england
and
had
infused
much
of
his
own
enthusiasm
into
his
fifteens
but
the
cricket
coach
a
somerset
professional
lacked
the
bull
personality
and
force
and
so
for
the
last
few
years
the
doings
of
the
eleven
had
been
slight
and
unmeritable
even
lovelace
major
had
been
unable
to
carry
a
whole
side
on
his
shoulders
as
soon
as
he
was
out
the
school
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
game
fernhurst
batting
was
of
the
stolid
lifeless
type
and
showed
an
almost
mechanical
subservience
to
the
bowling
but
for
gordon
this
term
was
sheer
joy
he
loved
cricket
passionately
last
season
at
his
preparatory
school
he
had
headed
the
batting
averages
and
kept
wicket
with
a
certain
measure
of
success
as
a
bat
he
was
reckless
in
the
extreme
time
after
time
he
flung
away
his
wicket
trying
to
cut
straight
balls
past
point
he
was
the
despair
of
anyone
who
tried
to
coach
him
but
he
managed
to
get
runs
for
cricket
the
school
house
was
divided
into
and
according
to
which
division
the
names
of
the
boys
fell
into
meredith
was
captain
of
the
house
and
of
while
fitzmorris
captained
for
the
first
half
of
the
term
there
were
junior
house
matches
played
in
the
american
method
and
afterwards
came
the
senior
matches
on
the
system
junior
this
year
had
quite
a
decent
side
foster
was
not
at
all
a
bad
slow
bowler
and
was
known
to
have
made
runs
collins
had
a
useful
but
unorthodox
shot
which
he
applied
to
every
ball
no
matter
where
it
pitched
and
which
landed
the
ball
either
over
shortslip
head
or
over
the
boundary
in
the
nets
it
was
a
hideous
performance
but
in
junior
house
matches
where
runs
are
the
one
consideration
it
was
extremely
useful
a
certain
betteridge
captained
the
side
not
because
of
any
personal
attainments
but
because
he
was
on
the
a
table
and
had
played
in
junior
house
matches
with
consistent
results
for
three
years
he
went
in
tenth
and
sometimes
bowled
these
matches
began
at
once
as
stewart
the
captain
of
the
eleven
was
anxious
to
spot
useful
men
for
the
colts
the
under
sixteen
side
who
wore
white
caps
with
a
blue
dragon
worked
on
them
and
so
on
the
second
saturday
of
the
term
drew
buller
in
the
first
round
before
the
game
fitzmorris
had
the
whole
side
in
his
study
to
fix
the
positions
in
the
field
some
of
the
side
had
played
little
serious
cricket
before
brown
in
fact
asked
if
he
might
field
middle
and
leg
but
at
last
they
were
placed
more
or
less
to
their
own
satisfaction
and
fitzmorris
gave
them
a
short
jaw
on
keenness
cricket
was
about
the
one
thing
he
really
cared
for
as
a
chemistry
specialist
he
spent
most
of
his
day
adoze
in
the
laboratory
it
was
only
in
the
cricket
field
that
he
really
woke
up
with
great
solemnity
betteridge
walked
forward
to
toss
with
felsted
the
buller
captain
a
few
seconds
later
he
returned
to
announce
that
buller
had
won
the
toss
and
put
them
in
the
captain
of
a
junior
house
side
is
always
very
fond
of
putting
the
other
side
in
first
warner
would
demand
rain
overnight
a
drying
ground
a
fast
wind
and
a
baking
sun
before
he
would
dare
do
such
a
thing
but
felsted
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
gordon
was
sent
in
first
with
collins
the
idea
was
to
try
and
knock
the
bowlers
off
their
length
early
gordon
was
very
nervous
the
bull
was
umpire
at
one
end
and
fitzmorris
at
the
other
meredith
had
strolled
over
to
watch
as
had
drawn
a
bye
mansell
was
in
the
pavilion
eating
an
ice
all
eyes
seemed
on
him
he
had
made
collins
take
the
first
ball
the
start
was
worthy
of
the
best
school
house
traditions
the
first
ball
was
well
outside
the
it
landed
in
the
national
school
grounds
that
ran
alongside
of
the
school
field
a
howl
of
untuneful
applause
went
up
this
was
the
cricket
anyone
could
appreciate
and
this
was
the
cricket
that
was
always
seen
on
a
school
house
game
its
only
drawback
was
that
could
not
last
collins
made
a
few
more
daring
strokes
in
the
second
over
he
made
a
superb
drive
over
shortslip
head
to
the
boundary
and
his
next
shot
nearly
ended
fitzmorris
somnolent
existence
it
was
great
while
it
lasted
but
like
all
great
things
it
came
to
an
end
he
gave
the
simplest
of
chances
to
cover
point
and
buller
rarely
missed
their
catches
it
was
so
with
nearly
all
the
other
members
of
the
side
three
or
four
terrific
hits
and
then
back
under
the
trees
again
gordon
alone
seemed
at
all
comfortable
either
the
novelty
of
the
surroundings
it
was
only
his
second
innings
at
fernhurst
or
else
the
presence
of
the
bull
quieted
his
customary
recklessness
at
any
rate
he
attempted
no
on
the
and
in
consequence
found
little
difficulty
in
staying
in
the
boundaries
as
was
natural
on
a
side
ground
were
quite
close
runs
came
quite
easily
during
the
interval
after
dismissal
the
bull
walked
across
to
him
how
old
are
you
caruthers
thirteen
and
a
half
sir
oh
good
thing
to
come
young
i
did
myself
keep
that
left
foot
well
across
and
you
stop
in
all
day
well
done
stick
to
it
gordon
was
amazingly
bucked
up
he
had
always
heard
the
bull
was
house
and
here
he
was
encouraging
one
of
his
enemies
what
rot
fellows
did
talk
splendid
man
the
bull
he
would
tell
mansell
so
that
night
and
his
opinion
was
even
more
strengthened
when
after
he
had
been
clean
bowled
for
without
a
chance
the
bull
stopped
him
on
the
way
out
and
said
well
done
caruthers
plucky
knock
go
and
have
a
tea
at
the
and
put
it
down
to
my
account
the
school
house
innings
closed
for
one
hundred
and
nothing
like
big
enough
said
foster
fitzmorris
overheard
him
rot
absolute
rot
if
you
go
on
the
field
in
that
spirit
you
wo
get
a
single
man
out
go
in
and
win
and
a
very
fine
fight
the
house
put
up
foster
bowled
splendidly
betteridge
was
fast
asleep
at
point
and
brought
off
a
marvellous
catch
while
gordon
stumped
felsted
in
his
third
over
after
an
hour
play
seven
men
were
out
for
about
ninety
the
scorers
were
at
variance
so
the
exact
score
could
not
be
discovered
there
seemed
a
reasonable
chance
of
winning
and
to
his
dying
day
gordon
will
maintain
that
they
would
have
won
but
for
that
silly
ass
of
an
umpire
fitzmorris
bridges
the
buller
was
run
out
by
yards
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
everyone
saw
it
but
long
hours
at
the
laboratory
had
made
it
very
hard
for
fitzmorris
to
concentrate
his
brain
on
anything
for
a
long
time
he
was
happily
dreaming
let
us
hope
of
carbon
bisulphate
when
the
roar
how
that
woke
him
up
he
had
to
give
the
man
not
out
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
twenty
minutes
later
with
a
scandalous
bridges
made
the
winning
hit
never
mind
your
men
put
up
a
good
fight
the
luck
was
all
on
our
side
said
the
bull
to
caruthers
let
see
it
sunday
is
it
well
on
monday
then
come
round
to
the
nets
you
want
to
practise
getting
that
left
foot
across
look
here
just
get
your
bat
and
i
toss
you
up
one
or
two
now
at
the
nets
that
night
the
bull
talking
over
the
game
with
his
side
in
the
dormitories
said
that
caruthers
you
know
he
a
good
man
sort
of
fellow
we
want
in
the
school
can
fight
an
uphill
game
got
grit
make
a
lot
of
runs
for
the
school
some
day
on
monday
gordon
saw
his
name
down
for
nets
with
the
colts
eleven
life
was
good
just
then
if
only
jeffries
were
there
too
chapter
vi
clarke
ferguson
the
house
is
getting
jolly
slack
something
got
to
be
done
ferguson
sat
up
in
his
chair
clarke
had
been
quiet
nearly
the
whole
of
hall
there
was
obviously
something
up
oh
i
do
know
why
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
i
came
across
collins
and
brown
playing
stump
cricket
in
the
cloisters
instead
of
studying
thucydides
that
what
i
call
keenness
what
did
you
say
to
them
oh
i
forgotten
now
but
it
was
something
rather
brilliant
i
know
it
was
quite
lost
on
them
the
shell
ca
appreciate
epigram
they
ought
to
read
more
wilde
great
book
ever
read
it
clarke
oh
confound
your
wildes
and
shaws
that
just
what
i
object
to
here
are
these
kids
who
ought
to
be
working
simply
wasting
their
time
thinking
of
nothing
but
games
why
i
was
up
in
the
house
tutor
room
last
night
and
was
glancing
down
the
list
of
form
orders
over
half
the
house
was
in
double
figures
but
my
good
man
why
worry
as
long
as
the
lads
keep
quiet
in
hall
and
leave
us
in
peace
what
does
it
matter
peace
at
any
price
what
i
say
we
get
so
little
of
it
in
this
world
let
us
hang
on
to
the
little
we
have
got
but
look
what
a
name
the
house
will
get
the
house
will
get
much
the
same
reputation
in
the
school
as
england
has
in
europe
the
english
as
a
whole
are
and
slack
they
worship
games
and
after
all
the
englishman
is
a
jolly
sight
better
fellow
than
the
average
german
or
frenchman
yes
of
course
he
a
better
fellow
but
the
rotten
thing
is
that
he
might
be
a
much
better
fellow
still
if
as
a
country
we
had
only
ourselves
to
think
about
let
us
put
up
a
god
of
sport
but
we
have
not
we
have
to
compete
with
the
other
nations
of
the
world
and
late
cuts
are
precious
little
use
in
commerce
this
athleticism
is
ruining
the
country
at
any
rate
i
am
not
going
to
have
it
in
the
house
in
hall
they
got
to
work
and
if
their
places
in
form
are
better
next
week
there
going
to
be
trouble
yes
there
most
certainly
be
trouble
i
ca
think
why
you
leave
well
alone
lord
henry
wootton
used
to
say
but
clarke
was
paying
no
attention
that
evening
he
got
up
after
prayers
to
address
the
house
will
nothing
stop
this
fellow
love
of
oratory
murmured
betteridge
i
have
to
speak
to
the
house
on
a
subject
which
i
consider
important
began
clarke
which
probably
means
that
it
most
damnable
nonsense
whispered
mansell
the
position
of
the
members
of
the
house
in
form
order
is
not
at
all
creditable
in
future
every
week
the
senior
member
of
each
form
will
bring
me
a
list
with
the
places
of
each
school
house
member
of
the
form
on
it
i
intend
to
deal
severely
with
anyone
i
find
consistently
low
i
hope
however
that
i
shall
not
have
need
to
this
is
the
best
house
socially
and
athletically
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
the
best
house
at
work
too
as
i
prophesied
said
mansell
most
damnable
nonsense
on
the
second
and
third
forms
this
speech
had
a
considerable
effect
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
cockburn
did
some
work
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
was
able
to
announce
that
he
had
gone
up
two
places
from
seventeenth
to
fifteenth
there
were
seventeen
in
the
form
the
shell
and
the
lower
fourth
were
of
course
too
old
to
consider
the
possibility
of
actually
working
it
was
a
preposterous
idea
something
had
to
be
done
however
so
collins
bought
excellent
translations
of
the
works
of
vergil
and
xenophon
a
vote
of
thanks
proposed
by
foster
and
seconded
by
brown
was
very
properly
carried
but
in
b
and
iv
a
there
were
some
strong
rebellious
spirits
who
would
not
bow
down
under
any
tyranny
in
study
no
at
the
end
of
the
passage
on
the
lower
landing
mansell
addressed
a
meeting
of
delegates
with
great
fervour
from
time
immemorial
he
thundered
out
it
has
been
the
privilege
of
the
members
of
this
house
he
had
been
reading
the
day
before
to
enjoy
themselves
to
work
if
they
wanted
to
to
smoke
if
they
wanted
to
to
do
any
damned
thing
they
wanted
to
the
only
thing
they
got
to
do
was
to
play
like
hell
in
the
easter
term
and
that
clarke
trying
to
make
us
do
work
and
what
is
more
to
work
for
claremont
gentlemen
let
us
stand
by
our
traditions
mr
bottomley
is
useful
at
times
that
all
very
jolly
said
the
practical
farrow
but
what
are
you
doing
oh
it
does
matter
what
we
do
as
long
as
we
stand
up
for
our
rights
who
ever
heard
of
school
house
men
working
now
look
here
my
good
fellows
said
the
ingenious
archie
it
quite
simple
if
you
will
only
do
as
i
tell
you
clarke
told
us
to
bring
him
a
form
list
the
obvious
thing
to
do
is
not
to
bring
one
at
all
but
you
silly
ass
the
fellow
who
ought
to
have
brought
it
will
get
into
the
very
hades
of
a
row
exactly
but
who
is
the
responsible
person
clarke
said
the
senior
man
well
now
in
iv
a
i
am
as
far
as
work
is
concerned
the
senior
man
in
the
form
but
hasel
has
been
in
the
form
a
term
longer
than
me
while
farrow
a
most
arrant
idiot
who
has
only
just
reached
the
form
has
been
in
the
house
a
year
longer
than
either
of
us
there
is
no
senior
man
we
have
all
excellent
claims
to
the
position
but
we
waive
them
in
favour
of
our
inferiors
archie
was
at
once
acclaimed
as
the
napoleon
of
deceit
that
week
clarke
found
no
form
order
either
from
iv
a
or
after
prayers
that
evening
he
asked
to
see
all
those
in
iv
a
and
when
the
conspirators
arrived
at
his
study
clarke
found
that
everything
had
been
elaborately
prepared
there
was
not
a
single
hitch
in
the
argument
no
one
was
at
fault
there
had
been
a
general
misunderstanding
they
were
of
course
very
sorry
clarke
listened
in
silence
well
i
sorry
this
has
happened
but
when
i
say
that
i
want
a
thing
done
i
expect
it
to
be
done
none
of
you
are
to
blame
particularly
but
you
are
all
equally
guilty
i
shall
be
forced
to
cane
the
lot
of
you
there
was
a
gasp
they
had
known
clarke
was
a
strong
man
but
they
had
hardly
expected
this
mansell
was
indignant
but
look
here
clarke
you
ca
beat
me
i
a
house
cap
ca
i
it
has
been
a
house
tradition
for
years
that
a
house
cap
ca
be
beaten
i
am
sorry
mansell
but
i
have
little
respect
for
traditions
will
you
all
wait
for
me
in
the
sixth
form
room
all
right
i
shall
go
to
the
chief
then
i
do
think
you
will
mansell
the
chief
was
not
very
fond
of
receiving
complaints
about
his
house
prefects
it
was
of
course
obvious
that
clarke
when
he
had
started
on
a
job
like
this
had
to
carry
it
through
if
he
had
gone
back
his
position
would
have
been
impossible
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
disastrous
campaign
as
far
as
the
unity
of
the
house
was
concerned
at
once
the
house
was
divided
into
sides
and
nearly
the
whole
of
the
sixth
form
was
against
clarke
it
not
the
duty
of
the
head
of
the
house
to
see
how
people
are
working
that
is
a
house
master
job
pointed
out
fitzmorris
all
clarke
has
got
to
do
is
to
see
that
the
kids
do
rag
in
hall
and
at
other
times
more
or
less
behave
themselves
the
house
was
in
a
state
of
open
rebellion
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
none
of
the
other
prefects
made
any
attempt
to
keep
order
now
there
was
a
rule
that
in
hall
only
three
people
might
be
allowed
in
one
study
the
idea
being
that
if
more
got
in
work
would
be
bound
to
change
into
conversation
one
evening
however
a
huge
crowd
slowly
congregated
in
mansell
study
lovelace
dropped
in
to
borrow
a
book
and
stayed
hunter
and
gordon
came
for
a
chat
and
stayed
too
archie
fletcher
had
as
was
usual
with
him
done
all
his
preparation
in
and
was
in
search
of
something
to
do

a
noise
outside
walked
in
and
stopped
to
give
his
opinion
on
the
chances
of
beating
that
week
in
a
few
minutes
the
conversation
got
rather
heated
the
noise
could
be
heard
all
down
the
passage
meredith
came
down
to
see
what
was
going
on
ah
party
well
mansell
got
over
your
beating
yet
there
was
subdued
laughter
i
say
meredith
have
the
slightest
chance
of
beating
us
on
thursday
lovelace
was
captain
of
junior
and
had
laid
rather
heavily
on
a
victory
of
course
not
my
good
man
i
going
to
umpire
this
time
the
laughter
was
not
subdued
in
his
retreat
at
the
far
end
of
the
studies
clarke
heard
it
down
the
passage
he
thundered
knocked
at
the
door
and
came
in
what
the
meaning
of
this
you
know
quite
well
that
not
more
than
three
are
allowed
in
here
at
one
time
come
to
my
study
the
lot
of
you
all
this
time
meredith
was
being
jammed
behind
the
door
when
you
have
quite
finished
clarke
he
said
i
am
sorry
meredith
are
you
responsible
for
this
in
a
way
yes
i
was
rather
afraid
that
the
house
was
getting
slack
about
their
work
a
very
bad
thing
for
a
house
clarke
so
i
took
this
opportunity
of
holding
a
little
viva
voce
examination
we
were
studying
sermon
on
the
mount
a
singularly
beautiful
and
impressive
passage
clarke
have
you
read
it
clarke
had
read
it
that
day
as
the
lesson
in
chapel
he
had
also
read
it
rather
badly
having
a
cold
in
his
head
you
seem
to
have
rather
a
large
class
meredith
he
said
sarcastically
yes
like
our
good
lord
i
have
beaten
the
and
the
hedges
and
i
am
almost
afraid
i
shall
also
have
to
beat
mansell
he
has
singularly
failed
to
appreciate
the
full
meaning
of
that
passage
about
clarke
saw
he
was
beaten
and
turned
away
as
he
walked
down
the
passage
he
heard
a
roar
of
laughter
coming
from
study
no
the
story
was
all
round
the
house
in
and
on
his
way
down
to
prayers
clarke
heard
fitzmorris
say
before
a
whole
crowd
you
are
a
great
fellow
meredith
that
the
way
to
keep
these
upstarts
in
order
that
night
there
was
merriment
in
the
games
study
and
ferguson
advised
clarke
to
let
the
matter
drop
after
all
you
know
it
not
your
business
and
perhaps
clarke
realised
that
ferguson
was
for
once
right
but
he
had
to
go
on
it
was
very
hard
though
he
had
been
quite
popular
before
he
was
head
of
the
house
he
wished
he
had
left
a
year
ago
for
it
is
hard
to
be
hated
where
one
loves
and
clarke
well
as
he
loved
fernhurst
loved
the
house
a
hundred
times
more
well
played
caruthers
jolly
good
knock
well
done
caruthers
lovelace
and
mansell
banged
excitedly
into
gordon
study
the
evening
after
the
colts
match
murchester
gordon
had
made
on
a
wet
wicket
and
a
defeat
by
over
a
hundred
runs
was
no
fault
of
his
he
had
gone
in
first
wicket
down
and
stayed
till
the
close
it
was
splendid
you
ought
to
be
a
cert
for
your
colts
cap
bull
was
fearfully
bucked
oh
i
do
know
it
was
not
so
very
much
in
his
heart
of
hearts
gordon
was
pretty
certain
he
would
get
his
cap
but
it
would
never
do
to
show
what
he
thought
oh
rot
my
good
man
burst
out
lovelace
you
did
give
a
chance
after
the
first
over
and
by
jove
that
was
a
bit
of
luck
then
yes
you
know
i
have
a
good
deal
of
luck
one
way
and
another
i
have
got
in
a
single
row
yet
and
i
am
always
being
missed
and
some
fellows
have
no
luck
at
all
now
foster
was
batting
beautifully
before
he
was
run
out
never
saw
such
a
scandalous
all
the
other
man
fault
he
bowled
well
too
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
he
did
get
his
colts
cap
i
know
bull
likes
him
do
you
think
so
said
gordon
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
rather
hoped
foster
would
not
get
his
cap
he
himself
would
be
captain
of
junior
next
year
it
would
be
better
if
he
was
obviously
senior
to
foster
he
was
going
to
be
the
factor
and
so
far
as
seniority
goes
there
is
not
much
to
choose
between
men
who
get
their
colours
on
the
same
day
of
course
he
wo
if
you
do
mansell
said
but
i
think
worth
it
i
say
let
have
a
feed
there
just
time
before
hall
to
order
some
stuff
lovelace
rush
off
to
the
and
put
it
down
to
my
account
gordon
found
it
impossible
to
work
during
hall
he
fidgeted
nervously
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
on
the
last
day
of
his
first
term
before
he
knew
if
he
was
going
to
get
his
colts
cap
he
would
get
it
early
that
night
stewart
always
gave
colours
during
first
hall
he
sat
and
waited
nervously
work
became
quite
impossible
he
looked
through
daily
and
flung
it
aside
then
picked
up
london
that
was
rather
more
in
his
line
there
was
a
sound
of
talking
down
the
passage
he
heard
clarke
voice
saying
yes
down
there
third
study
down
no
a
second
later
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
he
managed
to
gulp
out
come
in
gratters
on
your
colts
cap
caruthers
well
played
stewart
shook
hands
with
him
the
next
minute
gordon
heard
him
walking
to
the
school
in
the
cloister
he
was
pinning
up
the
notice
gordon
sat
quite
still
his
happiness
was
too
great
no
one
is
allowed
to
walk
about
in
the
studies
before
eight
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
silence
in
the
passage
eight
struck
there
was
an
opening
of
doors
a
few
minutes
later
hunter
dashed
in
well
done
caruthers
hooray
well
done
caruthers
good
old
i
am
so
glad
everyone
seemed
pleased
just
before
prayers
as
he
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
fitzmorris
came
over
to
him
jolly
good
caruthers
well
done
his
cup
was
full
foster
did
not
get
his
cap
the
next
day
as
gordon
was
walking
across
the
courts
in
break
the
bull
came
up
to
him
gratters
caruthers
was
your
fault
you
lost
i
like
a
man
who
can
fight
uphill
you
have
got
the
grit
well
done
lad
and
yet
said
gordon
to
mansell
as
they
passed
under
the
school
gate
you
say
that
man
cares
only
for
his
house
why
he
only
loves
his
house
because
it
a
part
of
fernhurst
and
fernhurst
is
the
passion
of
his
life
chapter
vii
when
one
is
in
rome
generalisations
are
always
apt
to
be
misleading
but
there
was
surely
no
truer
one
ever
spoken
than
the
old
proverb
when
one
is
in
rome
one
does
as
rome
does
parsons
and
godmothers
will
of
course
protest
that
if
you
found
yourselves
among
a
crowd
of
robbers
and
drunkards
you
would
not
copy
and
yet
it
is
precisely
what
the
average
individual
would
do
when
a
boy
leaves
his
preparatory
school
he
has
a
conscience
he
would
not
tell
lies
he
would
be
scrupulously
honest
in
form
he
would
not
borrow
things
he
never
meant
to
return
he
would
say
nothing
he
would
be
ashamed
of
his
mother
or
sister
overhearing
but
before
this
same
innocent
has
been
at
school
two
terms
he
has
learnt
that
everything
except
money
is
public
property
the
name
in
a
book
or
on
a
hockey
stick
means
nothing
someone
once
said
to
collins
i
say
i
want
to
write
here
are
those
your
books
no
they
are
the
books
i
use
was
the
laconic
answer
the
code
of
a
public
school
boy
honour
is
very
elastic
masters
are
regarded
as
common
enemies
and
it
is
never
necessary
to
tell
them
the
truth
expediency
is
the
golden
rule
in
all
relations
with
the
common
room
and
after
a
very
few
weeks
even
congreve
would
have
had
to
own
that
the
timid
new
boy
could
spin
quite
as
broad
a
yarn
as
he
the
parents
do
not
realise
this
it
is
just
as
well
it
is
a
stage
in
the
development
of
youth
everyone
must
pass
through
it
yet
sometimes
it
leads
to
quite
a
lot
of
misunderstanding
there
were
one
or
two
incidents
during
this
summer
term
that
stood
out
very
clearly
in
gordon
memory
as
proofs
of
the
way
masters
may
fail
to
realise
the
boy
point
of
view
one
morning
just
after
breakfast
gordon
discovered
that
he
had
done
the
wrong
maths
for
jenks
he
rushed
in
search
of
fletcher
i
say
archie
look
here
be
a
sport
i
have
done
the
wrong
stuff
for
that
ass
jenks
let
have
a
look
at
yours
in
ten
minutes
four
tremendous
howlers
in
as
many
sums
had
been
reproduced
on
gordon
paper
the
work
was
collected
that
morning
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
it
till
the
next
day
gordon
thought
himself
quite
safe
and
had
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
matter
the
form
was
working
out
some
riders
more
or
less
quietly
suddenly
jenks
tired
voice
murmured
caruthers
did
you
copy
your
algebra
off
fletcher
no
sir
jenks
was
rather
fond
of
asking
such
leading
questions
caruthers
had
got
tired
of
it
the
man
was
a
fool
he
must
know
by
this
time
that
he
was
bound
to
get
the
same
answer
fletcher
did
you
copy
off
caruthers
no
sir
caruthers
did
you
see
fletcher
paper
no
sir
how
insistent
the
ass
was
getting
fletcher
did
you
see
caruther
paper
no
sir
oh
you
silly
fellows
then
i
shall
have
to
put
both
your
papers
before
the
headmaster
i
afraid
you
will
both
be
expelled
jenks
had
a
strange
notion
of
the
offences
that
merited
expulsion
every
time
he
reported
a
boy
he
expected
to
see
him
marching
sadly
to
the
station
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
once
collins
had
stuck
a
pin
into
a
wonderful
mercury
apparatus
and
entirely
ruined
it
oh
collins
you
stupid
boy
i
shall
have
to
report
you
to
the
headmaster
and
you
know
what
that
means
we
see
you
here
any
more
gordon
had
of
course
not
the
slightest
fear
of
getting
bunked
but
still
it
was
a
nuisance
he
would
have
to
be
more
careful
next
time
now
look
here
you
two
jenks
went
on
after
a
bit
if
either
of
you
cares
to
own
up
i
wo
report
you
at
all
i
will
deal
with
you
myself
slowly
gordon
rose
it
was
obviously
an
occasion
where
it
paid
to
own
up
i
did
sir
oh
i
thought
as
much
you
see
yours
was
in
pencil
and
if
possible
a
little
worse
than
fletcher
sit
down
betteridge
afterwards
said
that
to
watch
jenks
rushing
across
the
courts
to
see
the
chief
during
the
minute
interval
between
the
exit
of
one
class
and
the
arrival
of
the
next
was
better
than
any
pantomime
he
was
very
small
he
had
a
large
white
moustache
his
gown
was
too
long
it
blew
out
like
sails
in
the
wind
besides
it
was
the
first
time
jenks
had
ever
been
seen
to
run
in
due
time
caruthers
and
fletcher
appeared
before
the
chief
the
result
was
only
a
long
jaw
and
a
bad
report
the
chief
could
not
perhaps
be
expected
to
see
that
a
lie
was
any
the
less
a
lie
because
it
was
told
to
a
master
but
in
the
delinquents
any
feeling
of
penitence
there
might
have
been
was
entirely
obscured
by
an
utter
scorn
of
jenks
after
all
the
man
did
say
he
would
report
us
said
fletcher
oh
it
all
you
can
expect
from
these
men
they
have
no
sense
of
honour
it
did
not
occur
to
gordon
that
in
this
instance
his
own
sense
of
honour
had
not
been
tremendously
in
evidence
the
public
school
system
had
set
its
mark
on
him
the
other
incident
was
the
great
clothes
row
all
rows
spring
from
the
most
futile
sources
this
one
began
with
the
sickness
of
one
who
was
suddenly
taken
ill
in
form
it
was
a
hot
day
and
he
fainted
now
was
an
absolute
nonentity
it
was
only
his
second
term
but
he
had
already
learnt
that
anything
that
was
in
the
was
common
property
and
so
when
the
matron
took
off
his
shoes
before
putting
him
to
bed
she
saw
rudd
name
inside
the
matter
was
reported
to
the
chief
the
chief
made
a
tour
of
the
during
afternoon
school
and
his
eyes
were
opened
for
instance
it
was
quite
obvious
that
turner
had
changed
his
school
suit
was
hung
on
his
peg
his
blazer
was
presumably
on
him
and
yet
his
cricket
trousers
were
lying
on
the
floor
with
fischer
house
scarf
sticking
out
of
the
pocket
there
were
many
other
like
discoveries
in
hall
that
night
the
chief
asked
turner
whose
trousers
he
was
wearing
that
afternoon
the
wretched
youth
had
not
the
slightest
idea
all
he
knew
was
that
they
were
not
his
own
he
thought
they
might
be
bradford
after
prayers
the
chief
addressed
the
house
on
the
subject
he
pointed
out
how
carelessness
in
little
things
led
to
carelessness
in
greater
and
how
dangerous
it
was
to
get
into
a
habit
of
taking
other
things
without
thinking
he
also
said
that
it
was
most
unhealthy
to
wear
someone
else
clothes
he
was
of
course
quite
right
but
the
house
could
not
see
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
did
not
want
to
see
it
it
would
be
an
awful
nuisance
to
have
to
look
after
one
own
things
besides
probably
the
man
next
to
you
had
a
much
newer
sweater
the
house
intended
to
go
on
as
before
and
indeed
it
did
one
day
ferguson
thought
he
wanted
some
exercise
it
was
a
and
clarke
was
quite
ready
for
a
game
of
tennis
ferguson
went
down
to
the
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
that
his
tennis
shoes
were
gone
he
thought
it
quite
impossible
that
anyone
should
dare
to
bag
his
things
fuming
with
wrath
he
banged
into
the
matron
room
i
say
matron
look
here
my
tennis
shoes
are
gone
and
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
chief
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
glancing
down
the
dormitory
list
oh
really
ferguson
i
must
see
about
this
matron
do
you
know
anything
about
ferguson
shoes
no
sir
never
touch
the
boys
shoes
george
is
the
only
person
who
looks
after
them
and
he
only
cleans
boots
and
shoes
oh
well
then
ferguson
you
better
come
with
me
and
we
will
make
a
search
for
them
ferguson
cursed
inwardly
this
would
mean
at
least
wasted
and
he
could
so
easily
have
found
another
pair
the
school
house
is
a
noble
affair
it
is
about
seventy
feet
long
and
sixty
wide
all
round
it
run
small
benches
in
the
middle
are
stands
for
corps
clothes
at
one
end
there
is
what
was
once
a
piano
laboriously
the
chief
and
ferguson
hunted
round
the
room
in
the
far
corner
there
was
an
airing
cupboard
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
ferguson
climb
up
on
the
top
of
this
he
was
not
a
gymnast
and
he
took
some
time
doing
it
hunter
sat
changing
at
one
end
of
the
room
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
down
the
passage
a
loud
tuneless
voice
began
to
sing
were
you
with
last
night
and
mansell
rolled
in
he
saw
the
chief
and
stopped
suddenly
going
over
to
hunter
what
does
the
old
idiot
want
he
hunting
for
ferguson
tennis
shoes
good
lord
and
i
got
them
on
well
get
them
off
then
quick
in
a
second
while
the
chief
was
looking
the
other
way
mansell
stole
across
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
laid
them
on
the
top
of
the
pipes
about
two
minutes
later
ferguson
burst
out
look
sir
here
they
are
but
my
dear
ferguson
i
sure
we
must
have
looked
there
yes
sir
i
thought
we
had
er
any
rate
there
are
your
shoes
ferguson
and
i
hope
you
have
a
good
game
the
chief
went
out
rather
annoyed
at
having
wasted
so
much
time
at
tea
that
evening
there
was
mirth
at
the
b
table
on
this
occasion
trouble
was
avoided
but
one
day
willing
a
new
boy
lost
his
corps
hat
he
was
certain
it
had
been
there
before
lunch
the
corps
parade
was
already
falling
in
seeing
no
other
hat
to
fit
him
he
very
idiotically
went
on
without
a
hat
at
all
it
would
have
been
far
better
to
have
cut
parade
altogether
clarke
asked
him
where
his
hat
was
but
his
ideas
on
the
subject
were
very
nebulous
the
whole
corps
was
kept
waiting
while
school
house
hats
were
examined
ten
people
had
got
hats
other
than
their
own
they
each
got
a
georgic
the
fury
of
the
house
now
broke
loose
everyone
swore
he
would
murder
clarke
on
the
last
day
bag
his
clothes
and
hold
him
in
a
cold
bath
for
if
half
of
the
things
that
were
going
to
be
done
on
the
last
day
ever
happened
how
very
few
heads
of
houses
would
live
to
tell
the
tale
it
is
so
easy
to
talk
so
very
hard
to
do
anything
a
head
of
the
house
is
absolutely
supreme
if
he
is
at
all
sensitive
it
is
possible
to
make
his
life
utterly
wretched
by
a
silent
demonstration
of
hatred
but
if
he
is
at
all
a
man
threats
can
never
mature
and
clarke
was
a
man
during
his
last
days
at
fernhurst
he
was
supremely
miserable
the
house
was
split
up
into
factions
he
himself
had
no
one
to
talk
to
except
ferguson
and
sandham
but
he
carried
on
the
grim
joke
to
its
completion
in
the
last
week
he
beat
four
boys
for
being
low
in
form
and
gave
a
whole
dormitory
a
hundred
lines
daily
till
the
end
of
the
term
for
talking
after
lights
out
the
chief
was
sorry
to
lose
him
ferguson
would
make
a
very
weak
head
the
future
was
not
too
bright
i
say
you
know
i
think
i
had
better
get
a
this
term
gordon
announced
this
fact
as
the
lower
fifth
were
pretending
to
prepare
for
the
exam
mansell
protested
now
do
be
a
damned
ass
my
good
man
you
do
know
when
you
are
well
off
you
stop
with
old
methuselah
a
bit
longer
he
is
a
most
damnable
ass
but
his
form
is
a
glorious
slack
oh
well
i
do
know
i
think
the
sixth
is
slacker
still
i
am
going
to
specialise
in
something
when
i
get
there
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
but
it
going
to
mean
a
lot
of
study
hours
at
fernhurst
there
was
a
great
scheme
by
which
specialists
always
worked
in
their
studies
to
specialise
was
the
dream
of
every
school
house
boy
it
is
so
charming
to
watch
from
the
warm
repose
of
your
own
study
black
figures
rushing
across
the
courts
on
the
way
to
their
it
always
rained
at
fernhurst
and
gordon
was
essentially
a
hedonist
yes
i
suppose
the
higher
you
go
up
the
less
work
you
do
said
mansell
when
i
was
with
old
i
used
to
prepare
my
lessons
sometimes
and
what
more
with
a
dictionary
oh
mutatus
ab
sighed
gordon
yes
you
know
said
betteridge
the
higher
you
get
up
the
school
the
less
you
need
worry
about
what
you
do
the
prefect
is
supposed
to
be
the
model
of
what
a
public
school
boy
should
be
and
yet
he
is
about
the
fastest
fellow
in
the
school
if
i
got
caught
in
davenham
study
by
the
chief
even
if
i
said
i
was
only
borrowing
a
pencil
i
should
get
in
the
deuce
of
a
row
but
meredith
can
sit
there
all
hall
and
say
making
inquiries
about
a
boxing
competition
he
trusted
the
lower
forms
are
allowed
to
prepare
in
their
studies
they
might
use
a
crib
so
they
have
to
work
in
the
or
big
school
the
fifth
is
trusted
to
work
so
it
can
spend
school
hours
in
its
studies
of
course
the
third
works
the
whole
time
while
the
fifth
just
writes
the
translation
between
the
lines
and
then
plays
barge
cricket
it
no
use
trusting
a
public
school
boy
put
faith
in
him
and
he
take
advantage
of
it
and
yet
there
are
still
some
who
say
the
public
school
system
is
satisfactory
and
i
am
one
of
them
said
mansell
i
had
a
damned
good
term
so
far
and
next
term
when
i
get
that
big
study
i
shall
have
a
still
finer
time
school
may
be
bad
as
a
moral
training
but
i
live
to
enjoy
myself
here
to
the
public
school
system
long
may
it
live
betteridge
smiled
rather
sadly
he
was
not
an
athlete
the
summer
exams
turned
out
a
lamentably
dull
affair
claremont
superintended
the
shell
and
the
lower
fifth
anyone
who
wished
to
crib
could
have
done
so
easily
but
hardly
anyone
took
the
trouble
mansell
swore
he
would
stay
where
he
was
ruddock
johnstone
and
the
other
old
stagers
were
all
of
the
same
opinion
gordon
had
determined
to
get
high
enough
for
a
promotion
but
no
higher
tenth
would
do
and
it
was
easy
to
get
up
there
the
small
boys
in
the
front
bench
were
all
balliol
scholars
in
embryo
it
would
not
pay
them
to
crib
the
great
law
of
expediency
overhung
all
proceedings
the
result
was
that
they
were
as
lifeless
and
dull
as
most
other
virtuous
things
there
were
however
a
few
bright
incidents
the
foremost
of
which
was
the
divinity
exam
claremont
we
know
was
a
parson
and
a
lover
of
poetry
and
that
term
the
form
had
been
reading
judges
and
samuel
and
kings
as
the
divinity
exam
came
first
it
would
be
wise
to
put
the
old
man
in
a
good
temper
ruddock
introduced
mr
ffoakes
jackson
work
on
the
old
testament
disguised
as
a
there
is
nothing
easier
than
to
write
down
correct
answers
to
questions
if
you
have
the
in
front
of
you
passed
slowly
round
the
back
and
centre
benches
next
day
the
result
was
announced
well
said
claremont
i
must
own
that
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
results
of
the
divinity
papers
the
lowest
mark
was
out
of
a
hundred
and
that
was
kennedy
kennedy
was
invariably
top
in
the
week
order
ruddock
did
a
really
remarkable
paper
and
scored
a
hundred
out
of
a
hundred
johnstone
and
caruthers
both
got
and
several
others
were
in
the
nineties
in
fact
the
only
ones
in
the
eighties
were
those
who
usually
excel
i
have
taken
the
form
now
for
over
thirty
years
and
this
is
quite
unparalleled
i
shall
ask
the
headmaster
if
a
special
prize
can
not
be
given
to
johnstone
he
certainly
deserves
one
but
the
chief
was
very
wise
as
he
glanced
down
the
mark
list
he
realised
that
johnstone
marks
could
hardly
be
due
to
honest
work
but
the
chief
was
also
very
tactful
he
thought
on
the
whole
that
in
case
of
such
general
merit
it
would
be
invidious
to
single
any
individual
out
for
special
distinction
and
of
course
he
could
not
give
prizes
to
everyone
he
would
however
most
certainly
mention
the
fact
at
when
he
did
the
applause
was
strangely
mingled
with
laughter
but
this
was
only
one
incident
in
many
dull
hours
as
a
whole
the
week
exam
failed
to
provide
much
to
look
back
on
afterwards
with
any
satisfaction
even
the
chemistry
exam
fell
flat
fitzmorris
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
paper
on
jenks
desk
and
took
a
copy
of
it
the
marks
here
also
were
above
the
average
it
is
inevitable
that
the
end
of
the
summer
term
should
be
overhung
with
an
atmosphere
of
sadness
when
the
new
september
term
opens
there
are
many
faces
that
will
be
missing
the
giants
of
will
have
departed
another
generation
will
have
taken
their
places
but
for
all
that
these
last
days
are
not
without
their
own
particular
glory
rome
must
have
been
very
wonderful
during
the
last
week
of
consulship
and
in
the
passing
of
meredith
there
was
something
essentially
splendid
for
it
happens
so
seldom
in
life
that
the
culminating
point
of
our
success
coincides
with
the
finish
of
anything
we
are
continually
being
mocked
by
the
horror
of
the
second
best
we
do
not
know
where
to
stop
we
cling
too
long
to
our
laurels
and
when
the
end
finally
comes
they
have
begun
to
wither
death
is
an
the
heart
that
once
loved
and
was
as
grass
before
the
winds
of
passion
has
grown
cold
amid
a
world
of
commonplace
but
at
school
there
is
no
dragging
out
of
triumphs
all
too
soon
the
six
short
years
fly
past
and
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
life
in
the
very
flush
of
our
pride
just
once
in
a
while
we
may
finish
in
style
it
is
not
often
the
roses
fade
the
final
of
the
senior
house
matches
was
drawing
to
a
close
on
the
last
friday
of
the
term
buller
were
beating
the
school
house
easily
there
had
never
been
any
doubt
about
the
result
was
entirely
a
side
that
meredith
had
managed
to
carry
it
on
his
shoulders
through
the
two
first
rounds
the
house
had
only
two
wickets
in
hand
and
still
wanted
over
eighty
runs
to
avoid
an
innings
defeat
but
meredith
was
still
in
it
had
been
a
great
innings
he
had
gone
in
first
with
mansell
and
watched
wicket
after
wicket
fall
while
he
had
gone
on
playing
the
same
brilliant
game
every
stroke
was
the
signal
of
a
roar
from
the
pavilion
the
whole
house
was
looking
on
it
was
a
fitting
end
to
a
dazzling
career
it
was
like
his
life
reckless
and
magnificent
at
last
he
a
and
was
caught
in
the
deep
for
as
he
left
the
wicket
the
whole
house
surged
forward
in
front
of
the
pavilion
and
formed
up
in
two
lines
leaving
a
gangway
amid
tremendous
applause
meredith
ran
between
them
the
cheering
was
deafening
after
prayers
that
night
the
chief
said
a
few
words
about
the
match
i
am
sorry
we
did
not
win
but
then
i
do
think
many
of
us
dared
to
hope
for
that
at
any
rate
we
were
not
disgraced
and
i
wish
to
take
the
opportunity
of
congratulating
meredith
not
only
on
his
superb
innings
this
afternoon
but
also
on
his
keen
and
energetic
captaincy
throughout
the
term
this
was
the
signal
for
another
demonstration
everyone
beat
with
their
fists
upon
their
table
it
was
a
great
scene
the
giants
of
our
youth
always
appear
to
us
much
greater
than
those
of
any
successive
era
in
future
years
gordon
was
to
see
other
captains
of
football
other
captains
of
cricket
but
with
the
exception
of
the
tremendous
lovelace
meredith
towered
above
them
all
he
was
at
that
moment
the
very
great
god
of
gordon
soul
he
seemed
to
be
all
that
gordon
wished
to
be
brilliant
and
successful
surely
the
fates
had
showered
on
him
all
their
gifts
on
the
last
monday
there
was
a
huge
feed
in
the
games
study
over
twenty
people
were
crowded
in
armour
was
there
mansell
gordon
simonds
foster
ferguson
everyone
except
clarke
there
was
no
one
who
was
not
sorry
to
lose
meredith
his
achievements
so
dazzled
them
that
they
could
see
nothing
beyond
them
they
were
proud
to
have
such
a
man
in
the
house
it
was
all
sheer
happiness
somehow
on
the
last
day
the
following
notice
appeared
on
the
house
board
in
memoriam
malevus
scholarum
in
hadibus
requiescat
quod
non
sine
ignominia
militavit
no
one
knew
who
was
responsible
for
it
clarke
looked
at
it
for
a
second
and
turned
away
with
a
face
that
expressed
no
emotion
by
the
sixth
form
green
simonds
was
shouting
across
to
meredith
best
of
luck
old
fellow
and
mind
you
come
down
for
the
house
supper
on
the
way

station
archie
fletcher
burst
out
well
thank
god
that
swine
clarke
gone
he
absolutely
mucked
up
the
house
gordon
agreed
if
we
had
a
few
more
men
like
meredith
now
rather
a
change
had
come
over
the
boy
who
a
year
before
had
been
shocked
at
the
swearing
in
the
bathroom
when
one
is
in

quantum

if
gordon
were
given
the
opportunity
of
living
any
single
year
over
again
exactly
as
he
had
lived
it
before
he
would
in
all
probability
have
chosen
his
second
year
at
fernhurst
he
had
then
put
safely
out
of
sight
behind
him
the
doubts
and
anxieties
of
the
junior
he
had
not
yet
reached
any
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
senior
it
was
essentially
a
time
of
laughter
of
rags
of
careless
happiness
every
day
dawned
without
a
trace
of
trouble
imminent
every
night
closed
with
a
feed
in
mansell
big
study
while
the
gramophone
strummed
out
choruses
and
yet
these
three
terms
were
very
critical
ones
in
the
development
of
gordon
character
sooner
or
later
everyone
must
pass
through
the
middle
stage
keats
speaks
of
where
the
way
of
life
is
uncertain
and
the
soul
is
in
a
ferment
most
boys
have
at
their
preparatory
schools
been
so
carefully
looked
after
that
they
have
never
learnt
to
think
for
themselves
they
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
they
believe
implicitly
what
their
masters
tell
them
about
what
is
right
and
wrong
life
is
divided
up
into
so
many
rules
but
when
the
boy
reaches
his
public
school
he
finds
himself
in
a
world
where
actions
are
regulated
not
by
conscience
but
by
caprice
boys
do
what
they
know
is
wrong
then
invent
a
theory
to
prove
it
is
right
and
finally
persuade
themselves
that
black
is
white
it
is
pure
chance
what
the
public
school
system
will
make
of
a
boy
during
the
years
of
his
apprenticeship
so
to
speak
he
merely
sits
quiet
listening
and
learning
then
comes
the
middle
period
the
period
in
which
he
is
gradually
changing
into
manhood
in
it
all
his
former
experiences
are
jumbled
hopelessly
together
his
life
is
in
itself
a
paradox
he
does
things
without
thinking
there
is
no
consistency
in
his
actions
then
finally
the
threads
are
unravelled
and
out
of
the
disorder
of
conflicting
ideas
and
emotions
the
tapestry
is
woven
on
the
wonderful
loom
of
youth
the
average
person
comes
through
all
right
he
is
selfish
absolutely
without
a
conscience
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
never
thinks
but
he
is
a
jolly
good
companion
and
the
freemasonry
of
a
public
school
is
amazing
no
man
who
has
been
through
a
good
school
can
be
an
outsider
he
may
hang
round
the
empire
bar
he
may
cheat
at
business
but
you
can
be
certain
of
one
thing
he
will
never
let
you
down
very
few
public
school
men
ever
do
a
mean
thing
to
their
friends
and
for
a
system
that
produces
such
a
spirit
there
is
something
to
be
said
after
all
but
for
the
boy
with
a
personality
school
is
very
dangerous
being
powerful
he
can
do
nothing
by
halves
his
actions
influence
not
only
himself
but
many
others
on
his
surroundings
during
the
time
of
transition
from
boyhood
to
manhood
depend
to
a
great
extent
the
influence
that
man
will
work
in
the
world
he
will
do
whatever
he
does
on
a
large
scale
and
people
are
bound
to
look
at
him
he
may
stand
at
the
head
of
the
procession
of
progress
he
may
dash
himself
to
pieces
fighting
for
a
worthless
cause
and
by
the
splendour
of
his
contest
draw
many
to
him
more
likely
he
will
be
like
byron
a
wonderful
irresponsible
creature
who
at
one
time
plumbed
the
depths
and
at
another
swept
the
heavens
a
creature
irresistibly
attractive
because
he
is
irresistibly
human
gordon
was
a
personality
his
preparatory
school
master
said
of
him
once
he
will
be
a
great
failure
or
a
great
success
perhaps
both
and
it
was
the
truest
thing
ever
said
of
him
at
present
the
future
was
very
uncertain
during
his
first
year
he
had
been
imbibing
knowledge
from
his
contemporaries
he
had
been
a
spectator
now
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
take
his
part
in
the
drama
of
fernhurst
life
all
ignorant
he
went
his
way
careless
arrogant
and
proud
it
must
be
owned
that
during
this
year
gordon
was
rather
an
objectionable
person
he
was
very
much
above
himself
for
five
years
he
had
been
tightly
held
in
check
and
when
freedom
at
last
came
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
use
it
he
was
boisterous
and
noisy
always
in
the
middle
of
everything
if
ever
there
was
a
row
in
the
studies
it
would
be
a
sure
assumption
that
caruthers
was
mixed
up
in
it
everything
combined
to
give
him
a
slack
time
ferguson
was
head
of
the
house
but
he
took
only
a
casual
interest
in
its
welfare
my
dear
betteridge
he
used
to
say
if
you
were
aware
of
the
large
issues
of
art
and
life
you
would
see
that
it
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
time
worrying
about
such
a
little
thing
as
discipline
in
a
house
you
should
widen
your
intellectual
horizon
read
verlaine
and
baudelaire
and
then
see
life
as
it
is
ferguson
was
a
poet
twice
a
term
the
school
magazine
was
enriched
with
a
poem
from
his
pen
his
last
effort
was
called
and
opened
with
the
line
in
amber
dreams
of
amorous
despair
the
bull
had
asked
someone
in
his
house
what
the
thing
meant
to
ferguson
that
seemed
a
high
compliment
to
be
incoherent
was
a
great
gift
swinburne
often
meant
very
little
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
ferguson
thought
was
on
the
whole
more
melodious
than
but
that
was
of
course
purely
a
matter
of
opinion
at
any
rate
it
was
a
fine
composition
and
a
poet
must
not
dabble
in
the
common
intrigues
of
little
minds
he
let
the
house
go
its
own
sweet
way
and
the
house
was
grateful
and
gave
ferguson
the
reputation
of
being
rather
a
sport
there
were
no
more
weekly
orders
no
more
cleaning
of
corps
clothes
there
was
at
last
peace
in
jerusalem
and
plenteousness
within
her
palaces
simonds
was
captain
of
the
house
he
was
working
hard
for
a
history
scholarship
and
could
not
spend
much
time
in
looking
after
house
games
there
would
be
tons
of
time
in
the
easter
term
to
train
on
house
sides
so
he
too
let
things
slide
and
the
house
lived
a
happy
life
those
who
wanted
to
play
footer
played
those
who
wanted
to
work
worked
those
who
wished
to
do
nothing
did
nothing
a
cheerful
philosophy
for
a
week
it
worked
quite
well
gordon
was
lucky
enough
to
find
himself
in
the
position
of
not
only
not
wanting
to
work
but
also
not
having
to
he
had
got
his
promotion
into
a
and
found
it
a
land
of
milk
and
honey
macdonald
his
form
master
was
one
of
the
most
splendid
men
fernhurst
has
ever
owned
on
its
staff
for
over
forty
years
he
had
sat
in
exactly
the
same
chair
and
watched
generation
after
generation
pass
without
appearing
the
least
bit
older
he
grew
a
little
stout
perhaps
but
his
heart
was
the
same
it
took
a
lot
to
trouble
him
he
realised
that
the
world
was
too
full
of
sceptics
and
cynics
and
swore
that
he
would
not
number
himself
among
them
he
was
now
the
senior
assistant
master
and
the
best
scholar
on
the
staff
you
know
these
young
men
are
what
we
were
he
used
to
say
to
his
form
not
one
of
them
can
write
a
decent
copy
of
latin
verses
all
these
cambridge
men
are
useless
useless
in
his
form
it
was
unnecessary
to
work
very
hard
but
in
it
the
average
boy
learnt
more
than
he
learnt
anywhere
else
for
macdonald
was
essentially
a
scholar
he
did
not
merely
mug
up
notes
by
german
commentators
an
hour
before
the
lesson
for
him
the
classics
lived
and
he
made
his
form
realise
this
to
do
aristophanes
with
him
was
far
better
than
any
music
hall
horace
he
hated
one
day
when
they
were
doing
gratus
eram
he
burst
out
with
wrath
horrible
little
cad
he
was
ca
you
see
him
small
man
blue
nose
with
too
much
drinking
bibulous
little
beast
if
i
had
been
lydia
i
would
have
smacked
his
face
and
told
him
to
go
to
chloë
i
have
had
done
with
him
beastly
little
cad
but
it
was
in
history
that
he
was
at
his
best
it
was
a
noble
sight
to
see
him
imitate
the
slobbering
james
i
and
he
had
the
private
scandals
of
henry
viii
at
his
for
all
commentators
he
had
a
profound
contempt
one
day
he
seized
farrar
edition
of
and
holding
it
at
between
his
finger
and
thumb
shook
it
before
the
form
filth
he
cried
filth
and
garbage
take
it
away
and
put
it
down
the
he
had
a
genius
for
spontaneous
comments
kennedy
was
very
nervous
and
whenever
he
said
his
he
used
to
hold
the
seat
of
his
trousers
man
man
macdonald
shouted
out
you
wo
be
able
to
draw
any
inspiration
from
your
stern
his
form
would
be
in
a
continuous
roar
of
laughter
all
day
long
and
when
particularly
pleased
it
always
rubbed
its
feet
on
the
floor
a
strange
custom
that
had
lasted
many
years
claremont
was
situated
just
above
him
and
he
could
often
hardly
hear
himself
speak
he
used
to
complain
bitterly
how
i
wish
my
jovial
colleague
down
below
would
keep
his
form
a
little
more
in
order
but
macdonald
got
his
revenge
one
day
when
claremont
was
reciting
macbeth
final
speech
fortissimo
to
his
form
hush
said
macdonald
we
must
listen
to
this
suddenly
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
do
you
think
he
really
imagines
he
is
doing
any
good
to
his
form
by
giving
that
nigger
minstrel
entertainment
up
there
the
roar
of
laughter
that
followed
quite
spoilt
the
effect
of
the
recitation
work
became
quite
impossible
in
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
house
began
to
interest
itself
in
the
welfare
of
rudd
rudd
was
the
senior
scholar
of
the
year
before
and
he
looked
like
it
he
was
fairly
tall
and
very
thin
his
legs
bore
little
relation
to
the
rest
of
his
body
they
fell
into
place
he
was
of
a
dusky
countenance
partly
because
he
was
of
byzantine
origin
partly
because
he
never
shaved
chiefly
because
he
did
not
his
clothes
always
looked
as
if
they
had
been
rolled
up
into
a
bundle
and
used
for
dormitory
football
perhaps
they
had
rudd
was
not
really
a
bad
fellow
he
was
by
way
of
being
a
wit
one
day
the
chief
had
set
the
form
a
divinity
paper
consisting
of
four
longish
questions
one
was
do
you
consider
that
the
teaching
of
socrates
was
in
some
respects
more
truly
christian
than
that
of
st
paul
rudd
showed
up
a
whole
sheet
with
one
word
on
it
yes
next
day
his
sixth
form
privileges
were
taken
away
but
the
house
took
little
notice
of
his
academic
audacities
rudd
did
not
wash
he
was
an
insanitary
nuisance
moreover
he
did
not
play
footer
that
man
rudd
is
a
disgrace
to
the
house
archie
announced
one
evening
after
tea
he
useless
to
the
house
he
slacks
at
rugger
and
is
unclean
let
ship
his
study
there
was
a
buzz
of
assent
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rowdyism
going
on
in
the
house
just
then
and
at
times
it
would
have
been
hard
to
draw
the
exact
borderline
between
ragging
and
bullying
a
solemn
procession
moved
to
study
no
rudd
was
working
hullo
byzantium
said
mansell
how
goes
it
oh
get
out
you
i
want
to
work
gentlemen
mr
rudd
wishes
to
work
betteridge
announced
the
question
is
shall
he
be
allowed
to
i
say
he
suddenly
jerked
away
the
chair
rudd
was
sitting
on
the
owner
of
the
study
collapsed
on
the
floor
archie
at
once
loosed
a
tremendous
kick
at
his
back
get
up
you
dirty
swine
have
you
any
manners
stand
up
when
you
are
talking
to
gentlemen
rudd
had
a
short
temper
he
let
out
and
caught
mansell
on
the
chin
it
is
no
fun
ragging
a
man
who
does
lose
his
temper
but
as
far
as
mansell
was
concerned
proceedings
were
less
cordial
after
this
he
leapt
on
rudd
bore
him
to
the
ground
and
sat
on
his
head
foul
language
was
audible
from
the
bottom
of
the
floor
rudd
had
not
studied
euripides
for
nothing
lovelace
picked
up
a
hockey
stick
this
gentlemen
he
began
is
a
hockey
stick
useful
as
an
implement
of
offence
if
the
prisoner
gets
above
himself
and
also
useful
as
a
means
of
destroying
worthless
property
i
ask
you
gentlemen
it
is
right
that
while
we
should
have
only
three
chairs
among
two
people
rudd
should
have
two
all
to
himself
gentlemen
i
propose
to
destroy
that
chair
in
a
few
minutes
the
chair
was
in
fragments
a
crowd
began
to
collect
i
say
you
men
shouted
gordon
the
refuse
heap
is
just
opposite
let
transfer
all
the
waste
paper
of
the
last
ten
years
and
bury
the
offender
just
across
the
passage
was
a
long
effect
running
under
the
stairs
which
was
used
as
a
store
for
waste
paper
it
was
cleaned
out
about
once
every
generation
in
a
few
minutes
baskets
had
been
bagged
from
adjoining
studies
and
no
was
about
a
foot
deep
in
paper
that
table
is
taking
up
too
much
room
lovelace
bradford
bawled
out
smash
it
up
the
table
went
to
join
the
chair
in
the
elysian
fields
rudd
was
now
almost
entirely
immersed
in
paper
the
noise
was
becoming
excessive
oaths
floated
down
the
passage
at
last
ferguson
moved
in
a
blasé
way
he
strolled
down
the
passage
for
a
minute
he
was
an
amused
spectator
then
he
said
languidly
suppose
we
consider
the
meeting
adjourned
i
think
it
nearly
gradually
the
crowd
began
to
clear
rudd
rose
out
of
the
paper
like
venus
out
of
the
water
a
roar
of
laughter
broke
out
well
rudd
i
sincerely
hope
you
are
insured
murmured
ferguson
what
rudd
said
is
unprintable
in
his
bill
at
the
end
of
the
term
his
father
found
there
was
a
charge
of
ten
shillings
for
damaged
property
in
study
no
rudd
got
less
the
next
term
i
say
you
fellows
have
you
heard
the
latest
bull
has
kicked
me
out
of
the
colts
lovelace
came
into
the
fuming
with
rage
there
had
been
a
colts
trial
that
afternoon
buller
had
cursed
furiously
and
finally
booted
lovelace
off
the
field
with
some
murmured
remarks
about
typical
school
house
slackness
it
damned
rot
said
bradford
because
simonds
has
made
rather
an
ass
of
himself
in
the
last
two
matches
bull
thinks
the
whole
house
is
slack
he
gave
turner
six
just
because
he
had
looked
up
one
word
i
hope
he
does
intend
to
judge
the
whole
house
by
simonds
the
house
was
getting
fed
up
with
simonds
it
was
all
very
well
working
in
moderation
for
scholarships
but
when
it
came
to
allowing
games
to
suffer
things
were
getting
serious
private
inclination
can
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
real
business
of
life
and
no
one
would
hesitate
to
own
that
he
had
come
to
fernhurst
mainly
to
play
footer
but
you
know
i
do
think
bull
that
sort
gordon
protested
he
may
lose
his
temper
and
all
that
but
i
think
he
fair
do
you
said
hunter
drily
there
was
a
laugh
as
a
whole
the
house
was
certain
that
the
bull
was
against
them
in
a
week
time
lovelace
was
back
again
in
the
colts
and
gordon
was
telling
his
friends
what
fools
they
were
not
to
trust
the
bull
gordon
was
confirmed
this
term
he
was
rather
young
but
it
was
obviously
the
thing
to
do
and
as
mansell
said
it
best
to
take
the
oath
when
you
are
more
or
less
and
there
is
still
some
chance
of
remaining
so
you
ca
tell
what
you
will
be
like
in
a
year
or
so
as
is
the
case
with
most
boys
confirmation
had
very
little
effect
on
gordon
he
was
not
an
atheist
he
accepted
christianity
in
much
the
same
way
that
he
accepted
the
conservative
party
all
the
best
people
believed
in
it
so
it
was
bound
to
be
all
right
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
not
the
slightest
influence
over
his
actions
if
he
had
any
religion
at
this
time
it
was
house
football
but
for
the
most
part
he
lived
merely
to
enjoy
himself
and
his
pleasures
were
on
the
whole
innocuous
they
very
rarely
went
much
beyond
ragging
rudd
do
you
think
said
gordon
the
evening
after
his
first
confirmation
address
that
the
masters
really
believe
confirmation
has
any
effect
on
us
because
you
know
it
does
i
do
think
it
matters
very
much
what
masters
think
said
hunter
most
of
them
here
have
got
into
a
groove
they
believe
the
things
they
ought
to
believe
they
are
all
copies
of
the
same
type
they
clean
forgotten
what
it
was
like
at
school
hardly
any
of
them
really
know
boys
they
go
on
happily
believing
them
a
little
excitable
but
on
the
whole
perfectly
straight
and
honest
then
a
row
comes
they
are
horrified
they
do
realise
all
of
us
are
the
same
they
made
themselves
believe
what
they
want
to
believe
yes
and
when
they
are
told
the
truth
they
wo
believe
it
said
betteridge
you
know
i
was
reading
an
article
in
some
paper
the
other
day
by
an
assistant
master
at
winchborough
called
ferrers
he
was
cursing
the
whole
system
i
showed
it
to
claremont
just
for
a
rag
told
him
i
thought
it
was
rather
good
the
old
fool
looked
at
it
for
some
time
and
then
said
betteridge
do
form
your
style
on
this
it
is
very
perfervid
stuff
not
always
grammatical
all
the
ass
thinks
of
is
whether
plurals
agree
with
singulars
he
does
not
care
a
damn
whether
the
material
is
good
that
it
said
gordon
masters
try
to
make
you
imitate
and
not
think
for
yourself
your
latin
verses
on
vergil
your
greek
prose
on
thucydides
your
english
on
matthew
arnold
but
do
think
for
yourself
do
be
original
if
anyone
big
began
to
think
he
see
what
a
farce
it
all
is
and
then
where
would
all
these
fossils
be
it
all
sham
look
at
the
reports
bradford
gets
told
he
a
good
moral
influence
mansell
works
hard
and
deserves
his
prize
it
is
hoped
that
confirmation
will
be
a
help
to
me
rot
it
all
is
oh
i
not
so
certain
confirmation
is
a
farce
broke
in
bradford
if
you
do
believe
in
it
you
wo
get
to
heaven
but
who
the
hell
wants
to
get
there
said
mansell
sing
hymns
all
day
long
i
can
imagine
it
fancy
having
caruthers
singing
out
of
tune
in
your
ear
for
ever
it
bad
enough
in
chapel
once
a
day
but
for
ever
my
good
lads
you
do
know
what
heaven
like
whispered
bradford
confidentially
claremont
was
gassing
away
about
browning
the
other
day
and
said
that
he
believed
that
in
heaven
you
could
do
all
the
things
you
wanted
to
do
on
earth
and
by
jove
i
would
have
a
hot
time
some
place
heaven
by
jove
yes
but
you
know
bradford
there
wo
be
much
left
for
you
to
do
in
heaven
at
the
rate
you
are
going
you
will
have
done
most
things
on
earth
oh
i
am
going
to
reform
and
then
i
shall
write
to
claremont
and
tell
him
how
i
a
wandering
sheep
was
brought
home
by
his
interpretation
of
andrew
dol
portio
i
think
that
what
the
thing
was
called
of
course
that
is
an
idea
said
mansell
but
i
am
not
so
sure
of
what
going
to
happen
when
we
dead
i
am
going
to
have
a
jolly
good
time
and
then
take
the
risk
i
never
hedge
my
bets
well
you
may
go
on
your
way
to
the
eternal
bonfire
said
bradford
but
i
am
for
righteousness
now
listen
to
this
it
in
the
book
we
have
to
read
for
confirmagers
lies
on
the
daily
if
you
think
that
in
your
house
things
are
being
talked
about
that
would
shock
your
mother
or
sister
do
merely
shun
it
as
something
vile
it
is
your
duty
to
fight
against
it
reason
with
the
boys
they
probably
have
some
grain
of
decency
left
in
them
if
that
fails
report
the
matter
to
your
house
master
he
will
take
your
side
the
boys
will
probably
be
expelled
but
you
will
have
done
your
duty
as
solomon
says
in
proverbs
there
now
mansell
i
am
one
of
the
children
of
light
so
you
know
what
to
expect
from
me
shall
i
reason
with
you
lad
have
you
a
grain
of
decency
left
in
you
or
must
i
at
this
point
a
cushion
put
an
end
to
the
fervour
of
the
new
child
of
light
betteridge
sat
on
his
head
look
here
bradford
he
began
you
may
be
a
convert
and
all
that
but
do
play
john
the
baptist
in
here
it
does
not
pay
very
shortly
i
shall
carry
your
head
to
the
dustbin
in
a
saucer
let
me
tell
you
the
story
of
one
stevenson
in
mr
macdonald
house
he
was
like
you
about
to
be
confirmed
and
was
like
you
very
full
of
himself
and
being
as
lovelace
a
lover
of
the
he
walked
about
in
his
study
in
hall
chanting
us
a
dirge
out
of
sheer
religious
fervour
name
is
down
for
the
confirmation
stakes
macdonald
passed
the
door
and
on
hearing
him
entered
and
said
you
are
scratched
now
at
any
rate
that
to
heart
and
be
not
as
the
seeds
that
are
sown
on
stony
ground
who
spring
up
in
the
night
and
wither
in
the
morning
betteridge
intoned
the
whole
lecture
the
story
was
in
a
way
true
but
the
stevenson
in
question
had
shouted
down
the
passage
hurrah
no
prep
my
name
is
down
for
the
confirmation
stakes
with
the
result
as
above
gordon
burst
out
by
the
way
talking
of
macdonald
he
made
a
priceless
remark
kennedy
that
little
cove
in
christy
came
in
late
and
began
stammering
out
that
it
was
only
a
minute
or
two
over
time
macdonald
looked
on
him
for
a
minute
and
then
said
excuse
is
just
about
as
good
as
the
woman
who
having
had
an
illegitimate
baby
protested
that
it
was
only
a
small
one
by
jove
he
some
fellow
now
he
a
man
said
mansell
he
a
boy
still
he
can
see
our
side
of
the
question
and
he
knows
what
footling
idiots
half
of
the
common
room
are
if
we
had
more
like
him
and
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
thing
too
said
betteridge
if
we
could
get
a
really
young
master
like
that
winchborough
man
ferrers
i
was
telling
you
about
he
stir
things
up
a
bit
at
that
moment
the
abbey
sounded
eight
good
lord
said
hunter
only
quarter
of
an
hour
more
and
we
done
nothing
the
whole
of
hall
let
rout
out
lovelace
and
go
and
rag
rudd
in
three
minutes
rudd
was
under
the
table
with
mansell
seated
on
his
chest
it
was
rather
unfortunate
that
gordon
should
have
chosen
tester
to
have
a
study
with
tester
was
over
sixteen
was
in
the
lower
sixth
and
had
got
his
seconds
at
cricket
he
was
a
house
blood
gordon
did
not
care
for
him
particularly
but
he
had
a
good
study
no
at
the
far
end
of
the
lower
landing
and
gordon
wanted
a
big
study
it
was
so
very
fine
to
sit
chatting
to
foster
or
collins
in
one
of
the
small
studies
for
a
little
time
and
then
to
say
suddenly
in
a
lordly
manner
oh
look
here
there
no
room
here
at
all
come
down
to
my
study
there
are
several
there
it
is
always
pleasant
to
appear
better
than
one
equals
but
tester
was
a
dangerous
friend
to
have
at
a
time
when
the
mind
is
so
open
to
impressions
for
tester
had
not
risen
to
his
position
on
his
own
merits
alone
lovelace
major
had
always
said
he
was
not
much
good
and
the
year
before
had
not
given
him
his
house
cap
but
tester
was
a
very
great
friend
of
stewart
the
captain
of
the
eleven
stewart
gave
him
his
seconds
for
making
twenty
against
the
town
so
meredith
had
to
give
him
his
house
cap
it
is
a
school
rule
that
a
seconds
must
have
his
house
cap
tester
was
not
improved
by
his
friendship
with
stewart
and
the
pity
was
that
he
was
really
clever
he
could
always
argue
his
case
i
never
asked
to
be
brought
into
this
world
he
said
i
am
just
suddenly
put
here
and
told
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
i
intend
to
make
the
best
of
things
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
like
with
my
life
wrong
and
right
are
merely
relative
terms
they
change
to
fit
their
environment
baudelaire
would
not
have
been
tolerated
in
the
hampstead
garden
suburb
catullus
would
not
have
been
received
in
sparta
but
at
paris
and
rome
customs
were
different
we
only
frame
philosophies
to
suit
our
wishes
and
i
prefer
to
follow
my
own
inclinations
to
those
of
a
sham
civilisation
gordon
did
not
like
this
but
if
one
lives
daily
in
the
company
of
a
man
who
is
clever
and
a
personality
one
is
bound
to
look
at
life
at
times
at
any
rate
through
his
spectacles
gordon
began
to
look
on
things
which
he
once
objected
to
as
quite
natural
and
ordinary
i
say
caruthers
i
hope
you
do
mind
clearing
out
of
here
for
a
bit
tester
would
say
stapleton
is
coming
in
for
a
few
minutes
you
quite
understand
do
you
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
look
on
a
thing
as
ordinary
and
natural
we
also
begin
to
think
it
is
right
after
a
little
gordon
ceased
to
worry
whether
such
things
were
right
or
wrong
it
was
silly
to
quarrel
with
existing
conditions
especially
if
they
were
rather
pleasant
ones
gordon
had
a
study
with
tester
till
the
end
of
the
summer
one
day
towards
the
end
of
the
easter
term
gordon
asked
tester
rather
shyly
if
he
would
leave
him
alone
a
little
i
often
cleared
out
for
you
you
know
of
course
that
quite
all
right
my
dear
fellow
any
time
you
like
i
understand
tester
smiled
as
he
walked
down
the
passage
but
during
the
winter
term
gordon
worried
about
little
except
football
when
he
was
not
playing
he
was
ragging
form
he
looked
on
as
a
glorious
recreation
he
was
learning
more
than
he
ever
learned
afterwards
without
making
much
effort
macdonald
was
a
scholar
he
did
not
teach
people
by
making
them
work
he
taught
them
by
making
it
impossible
for
them
to
forget
what
he
told
them
no
one
who
has
ever
been
through
the
upper
fifth
at
fernhurst
would
have
the
slightest
difficulty
in
writing
a
character
sketch
of
any
english
king
even
though
he
might
never
have
read
a
chapter
about
him
macdonald
made
every
man
in
history
a
living
character
not
a
sort
of
rack
on
which
to
hang
dates
and
facts
football
however
was
not
going
quite
so
satisfactorily
gordon
was
never
tried
for
the
colts
fifteen
although
he
subsequently
proved
himself
better
than
most
of
the
other
forwards
in
it
and
had
to
play
in
house
games
every
day
once
a
week
a
house
game
is
a
thundering
good
game
but
more
often
it
is
and
for
a
person
who
really
cares
for
footer
such
afternoons
are
very
dull
on
the
upper
or
lower
a
good
game
was
certain
the
captain
of
the
school
always
chose
sides
that
would
be
fairly
level
but
house
sides
were
different
nothing
depended
on
their
results
sometimes
bloods
would
play
sometimes
not
it
was
a
toss
up
and
worst
of
all
simonds
was
abominably
slack
for
a
few
weeks
the
house
thought
it
rather
funny
and
the
smaller
members
of
the
house
secretly
rejoiced
but
the
set
waxed
furious
damn
it
all
said
mansell
the
man
here
to
coach
us
not
to
sit
in
his
study
sweating
up
dates
the
result
of
it
was
that
mansell
and
his
friends
got
filled
with
an
enormous
sense
of
their
own
importance
they
considered
themselves
the
only
people
in
the
house
who
were
keen
and
they
let
the
rest
of
the
house
know
it
they
groused
about
the
great
days
of
lovelace
and
gave
people
like
rudd
a
most
godless
time
there
is
no
more
thoroughly
person
than
the
athlete
and
when
he
also
imagines
himself
an
isaiah
preaching
repentance
he
wants
kicking
badly
unfortunately
no
one
kicked
gordon
or
lovelace
and
they
went
on
their
way
contented
with
themselves
though
with
no
one
else
one
of
the
easiest
ways
of
discovering
a
person
social
status
at
school
is
by
watching
his
behaviour
in
the
the
or
toe
as
it
is
generally
called
is
a
long
wooden
building
with
corrugated
iron
roof
situated
just
opposite
buller
house
not
far
from
the
new
buildings
it
is
divided
by
a
wooden
partition
into
two
shops
at
each
end
of
the
outer
shop
run
two
counters
on
the
counter
which
is
connected
with
a
small
kitchen
cakes
muffins
and
sausages
are
sold
on
the
side
there
are
sweets
and
fruit
the
inner
and
larger
room
is
filled
with
tables
and
round
the
room
are
photographs
of
all
the
school
teams
at
the
far
end
in
huge
green
frames
are
hung
photographs
of
the
two
great
fernhurst
fifteens
who
went
through
the
season
without
losing
a
match
the
toe
is
the
noisiest
place
in
the
whole
school
it
is
superintended
by
five
waitresses
and
they
have
a
very
poor
time
of
it
the
real
blood
is
easily
recognised
he
strolls
in
as
if
he
had
taken
a
mortgage
on
the
place
swaggers
into
the
inner
room
puts
down
his
books
on
the
top
table
in
the
corner
only
the
bloods
sit
here
and
demands
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
macaroon
a
special
counter
has
been
made
by
the
bloods
table
so
that
the
great
men
can
order
what
they
want
without
going
back
into
the
outer
shop
no
real
blood
ever
makes
a
noise
in
the
outer
shop
when
he
is
once
inside
the
inner
shop
however
he
immediately
lets
everyone
know
it
if
he
sees
anyone
he
knows
he
bawls
out
i
say
have
you
prepared
this
stuff
for
christy
the
person
asked
never
has
nor
have
rot
i
call
it
no
blood
is
ever
known
to
have
prepared
anything
the
big
man
then
sits
down
if
a
friend
of
his
is
anywhere
about
he
flings
a
lump
of
sugar
at
him
when
he
gets
up
he
knocks
over
at
least
one
chair
he
then
strolls
out
observing
the
same
magnificent
dignity
in
the
outer
shop
no
one
can
mistake
him
but
the
only
other
person
who
makes
no
row
in
the
outer
shop
is
the
small
boy
who
creeps
in
and
creeps
out
unnoticed
everyone
with
any
claim
to
greatness
asserts
his
presence
loudly
the
chief
figures
at
this
time
were
the
junior
members
of
buller
and
especially
the
two
hazlitts
their
elder
brother
was
the
school
winger
and
an
important
person
but
they
had
done
nothing
but
make
a
noise
during
their
two
years
at
fernhurst
athleticism
had
had
a
disastrous
effect
on
them
because
their
house
had
won
the
thirds
two
cock
and
three
cock
they
thought
themselves
gods
in
the
they
acted
as
avenging
angels
sent
to
punish
a
wicked
world
their
chief
amusement
was
to
see
a
person
leaning
over
a
counter
kick
his
backside
when
he
was
not
looking
and
then
run
away
it
was
their
class
that
were
the
real
nuisance
in
the
toe
they
persecuted
the
girls
in
charge
most
damnably
very
often
only
one
girl
was
in
charge
the
younger
hazlitt
would
at
once
seat
himself
on
the
other
counter
and
shriek
out
nellie
when
are
you
coming
over
here
i
shall
bag
these
sweets
if
you
do
buck
up
he
would
then
seize
a
huge
glass
jar
of
peppermints
and
roll
it
along
the
zinc
counter
oh
mr
hazlitt
do
leave
that
alone
the
wretched
nellie
would
implore
but
it
was
no
use
when
there
was
a
big
crowd
waiting
to
be
served
the
hazlitt
brethren
would
take
knives
and
beat
on
the
zinc
counter
shouting
out
nellie
come
here
they
were
a
thoroughly
objectionable
pair
whenever
mansell
saw
them
he
kicked
them
hard
and
they
got
rather
frightened
of
the
school
house
after
a
bit
it
is
not
to
be
thought
however
that
the
behaviour
of
the
school
house
was
exemplary
mansell
usually
kicked
up
an
almighty
row
but
he
left
nellie
alone
he
was
not
going
to
lower
himself
to
the
hazlitt
level
it
is
an
amazing
thing
that
the
very
rarely
gets
into
a
row
and
yet
he
always
talks
as
if
expulsion
hung
over
his
head
probably
he
thinks
it
draws
attention
to
himself
mansell
would
always
enter
the
shop
in
exactly
the
same
way
he
banged
his
books
on
the
counter
and
sighting
hunter
fired
off
at
once
i
say
look
here
give
me
a
con
i
am
in
the
hell
of
a
hole
i
prepared
the
wrong
stuff
for
old
claremont
and
the
man
getting
awfully
sick
with
me
he
may
report
me
to
the
chief
do
help
me
out
sorry
old
cock
said
hunter
but
i
specialise
in
stinks
oh
do
you
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
chance
it
that
all
he
may
not
shove
me
on
the
small
boys
thought
mansell
daring
very
fine
but
strangely
enough
although
he
was
always
in
a
state
of
fearful
agitation
he
had
so
far
singularly
managed
to
avoid
getting
reported
but
still
it
kept
up
appearances
to
talk
a
lot
gordon
of
course
had
to
be
fairly
quiet
in
the
he
was
not
yet
known
among
the
school
in
general
and
it
was
only
in
buller
that
small
boys
gave
tongue
in
the
but
then
buller
were
in
their
own
opinion
to
the
rest
of
the
school
as
rome
was
to
italy
fernhurst
was
merely
a
province
of
buller
they
kept
this
view
to
themselves
however
the
bull
would
have
dealt
very
summarily
with
such
assumptions
and
so
when
lovelace
and
tester
and
mansell
were
there
gordon
was
generally
to
be
found
contributing
his
share
to
the
general
disorder
but
when
alone
he
sat
quite
quietly
with
collins
and
foster
he
rather
longed
for
the
day
when
he
could
start
a
row
all
on
his
own
a
strange
ambition
for
any
candidate
for
immortality
about
the
middle
of
the
term
was
the
field
day
at
salisbury
plain
most
of
the
public
schools
were
present
it
was
a
noble
affair
from
the
general
point
of
view
the
school
however
considered
it
a
putrid
sweat
for
hours
they
pounded
over
ploughed
fields
and
the
day
dragged
slowly
on
to
its
weary
close
and
two
hundred
very
tired
privates
at
last
fell
into
a
train
two
days
later
a
notice
was
brought
round
by
the
school
roll
for
all
those
who
went
to
salisbury
plain
on
wednesday
in
the
big
schoolroom
at
six
there
is
nothing
quite
so
enjoyable
as
the
sensation
that
a
big
row
is
on
in
which
you
yourself
have
no
part
gordon
trembled
with
excitement
he
whispered
excitedly
to
the
man
on
his
left
lidderdale
a
man
in
rogers
what
up
oh
nothing
much
some
silly
ass
put
his
bayonet
through
a
carriage
window
rogers
was
gassing
about
it
in
the
dormitories
last
night
oh
said
gordon
very
disappointedly
he
returned
to
his
academic
activities
he
had
had
hopes
of
some
splendid
row
and
after
all
it
was
only
about
a
silly
ass
and
a
bayonet
rotten
fancy
being
made
late
for
tea
because
of
that
but
as
it
turned
out
his
hopes
were
satisfied
when
he
reached
the
big
schoolroom
everything
certainly
looked
most
formal
in
front
of
the
big
dais
where
the
choir
stood
during
the
concerts
sat
all
the
masters
in
a
the
chief
sat
in
the
centre
are
they
all
here
udal
the
chief
asked
the
senior
sergeant
yes
sir
the
chief
rose
i
have
to
address
you
on
a
very
serious
subject
during
the
field
day
last
wednesday
someone
in
this
room
disgraced
not
only
his
school
but
the
king
uniform
an
officer
from
another
school
has
written
to
tell
me
that
he
overheard
two
of
you
talking
outside
the
canteen
in
language
that
would
disgrace
a
costermonger
i
sincerely
wish
he
had
taken
their
names
at
once
as
it
is
i
do
not
know
their
names
the
officer
in
question
said
that
both
boys
were
over
seventeen
and
that
the
shorter
of
the
two
said
nothing
at
all
as
far
as
he
could
hear
now
i
want
the
names
of
both
those
boys
if
they
own
up
to
me
i
shall
most
certainly
deal
very
severely
with
one
at
least
of
them
if
they
do
not
come
to
me
of
their
own
free
will
i
may
be
forced
to
ask
the
officer
to
come
down
and
identify
the
boys
in
which
case
both
will
from
that
instant
cease
to
be
members
of
fernhurst
school
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
the
school
poured
down
to
tea
i
bet
it
someone
in
christy
said
bradford
christy
believed
in
leaving
his
house
entirely
to
his
prefects
it
was
a
good
way
of
avoiding
responsibility
but
his
choice
of
prefects
was
not
altogether
wise
do
you
think
the
men
will
own
up
said
gordon
not
unless
they
most
abandoned
fools
replied
lovelace
there
was
only
one
topic
of
conversation
at
tea
and
afterwards
lovelace
hobson
and
gordon
discussed
the
affair
keenly
in
no
they
all
agreed
that
the
men
would
not
own
up
and
the
general
opinion
was
that
someone
in
christy
was
responsible
discussion
raged
fiercely
as
to
who
it
was
gordon
was
all
for
it
being
isaacs
lovelace
for
everington
hunter
for
mead
the
point
was
being
debated
when
tester
and
bradford
came
in
hullo
come
in
shouted
gordon
we
are
having
a
great
fight
about
this
i
say
isaacs
is
the
most
likely
man
what
do
you
think
tester
looked
round
carefully
and
then
began
anxiously
look
here
you
men
swear
you
wo
tell
a
soul
if
we
tell
you
something
the
oath
was
taken
well
it
us
there
was
a
hush
good
gawd
said
hunter
silence
ensued
but
curiosity
soon
overcame
surprise
what
did
you
say
by
the
by
asked
gordon
tester
repeated
as
far
as
he
could
remember
the
exact
words
yes
you
know
it
was
a
bit
hot
was
it
i
expect
you
opened
the
blighter
eyes
a
bit
he
was
used
to
that
sort
of
literature
in
spite
of
themselves
tester
and
bradford
laughed
they
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
a
figure
in
a
sam
browne
as
they
left
the
canteen
he
had
looked
some
ass
but
gordon
soon
became
serious
again
what
are
you
men
going
to
do
of
course
you
wo
own
up
we
ca
very
well
i
am
in
the
sixth
and
bradford
had
one
row
this
term
and
of
course
i
was
the
criminal
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
responsible
personage
of
course
owning
up
out
of
the
question
but
do
you
think
anything
will
happen
bradford
was
a
little
frightened
i
mean
will
there
be
a
sort
of
general
inspection
you
bet
there
wo
when
a
master
begs
men
to
own
up
it
means
that
he
up
the
spout
it
much
more
fun
catching
a
fellow
and
after
all
you
two
are
the
last
people
anyone
would
think
of
of
course
it
all
right
said
lovelace
there
only
one
thing
to
do
you
talk
of
nothing
else
but
this
rotten
affair
talk
about
it
in
the
toe
in
the
in
form
in
chapel
if
you
like
ask
people
you
meet
if
they
owned
up
treat
the
whole
thing
as
a
glorious
rag
yes
shouted
gordon
let
go
down
to
rudd
and
tell
him
if
he
own
up
we
give
him
hell
and
in
truth
the
next
was
for
rudd
very
hell
of
very
hell
his
existence
just
now
was
not
very
pleasant
if
he
had
been
good
at
footer
all
his
domestic
failings
would
have
been
forgiven
him
but
he
was
not
he
loathed
the
game
though
at
times
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
of
some
use
strangely
enough
at
oxford
he
found
people
respected
his
brains
and
no
one
hated
him
because
he
could
not
drop
goals
from
the
life
is
full
of
compensations
lovelace
and
tester
were
both
supreme
actors
that
night
in
the
dormitory
they
were
full
of
the
subject
after
lights
out
they
kept
the
whole
place
in
a
roar
of
laughter
bradford
joined
in
a
bit
but
he
was
still
nervous
visions
rose
up
before
him
of
an
officer
passing
down
the
ranks
suddenly
seizing
him
and
saying
this
is
the
man
it
was
hardly
a
ravishing
thought
but
it
was
useless
to
go
back
on
a
lie
tester
realised
this
as
ferguson
came
through
he
called
out
i
say
ferguson
you
know
you
better
go
up
to
the
chief
and
tell
him
you
did
it
ferguson
was
like
the
boy
scout
always
prepared
my
good
man
you
do
surely
imagine
i
am
so
devoid
of
good
feeling
and
have
such
a
hazy
conception
of
the
higher
life
as
not
to
inform
the
headmaster
i
have
just
returned
from
breaking
the
news
to
him
he
took
it
quite
well
on
the
whole
it
was
a
touching
scene
i
nearly
wept
betteridge
then
arose
and
gave
an
imitation
of
a
rogers
sermon
well
ferguson
i
must
own
that
i
am
sorry
to
lose
you
i
would
give
much
to
retain
you
here
but
aliter
you
must
go
you
are
expelled
between
the
scylla
of
and
the
charybdis
of
despair
you
have
a
long
time
steered
the
bark
of
the
school
house
but
one
failing
wipes
away
many
virtues
and
we
must
not
discriminate
between
the
doer
and
the
deed
the
actor
and
the
action
the
sinner
and
the
sin
the
same
punishment
for
all
but
in
that
paradisal
state
where
suns
sink
not
nor
flowers
fade
there
will
be
a
sweet
reunion
it
was
pure
rogers
the
dormitory
rocked
with
laughter
tester
began
to
give
his
impressions
of
what
the
officer
must
have
looked
like
there
was
a
heated
argument
as
to
whether
he
was
a
parson
mansell
thought
not
a
fellow
who
knows
his
bible
well
would
not
be
shocked
with
a
little
swearing
i
bet
some
of
the
bits
in
genesis
and
samuel
are
hotter
than
anything
the
blighter
said
it
was
probably
some
dotard
who
reads
keats
this
seemed
a
sound
piece
of
reasoning
next
day
the
rumour
spread
round
the
school
that
a
was
going
to
be
stopped
as
no
one
had
owned
up
safety
said
tester
that
means
the
chase
is
given
up
but
the
school
which
up
to
now
had
treated
the
affair
as
a
joke
began
to
get
annoyed
tolerance
and
broadmindedness
were
all
right
as
long
as
their
own
interests
were
secure
but
when
it
came
to
a
being
stopped
because
some
blighter
had
not
the
decency
to
own
up
it
a
scandal
said
fletcher
in
front
of
the
house
studies
first
this
blighter
does
the
school
a
lot
of
harm
by
swearing
and
then
he
is
in
too
much
of
a
funk
to
own
up
and
we
get
in
a
row
for
it
man
must
be
a
colossal
swine
he
forgot
that
last
night
he
had
been
treating
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
rogers
was
passing
by
up
the
headmaster
drive
on
the
way
to
his
and
overheard
this
outburst
of
righteous
indignation
his
heart
was
rejoiced
to
see
such
a
good
moral
tone
in
the
school
as
he
said
in
the
common
room
it
makes
one
proud
to
see
what
a
sane
unprejudiced
view
the
school
takes
of
this
unsavoury
incident
lovelace
now
hit
on
a
great
plan
let
organise
a
strike
why
should
we
go
into
school
if
we
can
get
enough
to
cut
we
ca
be
punished
let
canvass
the
fiery
cross
of
rebellion
was
flung
down
the
study
passages
with
lists
of
paper
in
their
hands
hunter
mansell
lovelace
and
gordon
tester
thought
himself
too
big
a
blood
for
such
a
proceeding
dashed
into
study
after
study
urging
their
inhabitants
to
sign
on
for
the
great
strike
come
on
you
men
hunter
said
it
is
the
idea
of
a
lifetime
if
enough
do
turn
up
nothing
can
happen
you
ca
sack
the
whole
school
a
few
bright
rebels
like
archie
fletcher
signed
on
at
once
rudd
too
thought
it
safer
to
put
his
name
down
but
the
average
person
was
more
cautious
how
many
have
you
got
down
oh
about
fifteen
well
look
here
if
you
get
over
fifty
i
join
in
as
nearly
everyone
said
this
the
hopes
of
successful
operations
seemed
unlikely
but
still
it
all
helped
to
disarm
any
trace
of
suspicion
i
say
ferguson
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
said
mansell
i
think
a
great
creed
has
gone
down
i
shall
no
longer
believe
that
conscience
and
cowardice
are
synonymous
only
conscience
is
the
trade
name
of
the
firm
mansell
laughed
it
was
probably
meant
to
be
funny
he
never
quite
understood
ferguson
on
the
next
afternoon
everyone
sat
down
to
two
hours
extra
school
there
was
much
swearing
at
tea
but
in
a
day
or
two
it
was
all
forgotten
to
this
day
no
one
at
fernhurst
knows
who
the
two
boys
were
the
secret
was
well
kept
as
the
term
drew
to
its
close
with
the
fifteen
filled
up
and
all
the
big
matches
over
interest
was
centred
mainly
in
house
football
and
house
affairs
mansell
it
is
true
was
still
worrying
whether
he
would
get
his
seconds
but
lovelace
and
gordon
talked
of
nothing
but
the
thirds
the
colts
matches
were
over
and
on
house
games
one
of
the
two
house
sides
was
always
a
trial
thirds
edwards
a
heavy
clumsy
was
captain
of
the
side
gordon
led
the
scrum
if
only
we
had
armour
back
as
house
captain
hunter
used
to
complain
that
side
could
lose
and
we
lose
either
said
gordon
we
are
going
to
sweep
the
field
next
term
and
we
are
going
to
drive
the
ball
over
the
line
somehow
and
god
save
anyone
who
gets
in
the
light
no
house
side
ever
imagines
it
is
going
to
be
beaten
three
cocks
have
been
lost
by
over
fifty
points
yet
on
the
morning
of
the
match
half
the
grovel
would
be
quite
ready
to
lay
heavy
odds
on
their
chance
of
winning
and
whenever
there
is
a
good
chance
of
victory
the
house
is
absolutely
cocksure
the
result
of
this
is
that
the
house
is
magnificent
in
an
uphill
fight
but
is
rather
liable
to
fling
away
a
victory
by
carelessness
but
this
side
was
certainly
pretty
hot
stuff
it
took
a
lot
to
stop
stewart
when
once
he
got
the
ball
and
lovelace
was
brilliant
in
attack
the
grovel
was
light
and
was
a
little
inclined
to
wing
but
in
the
loose
it
was
a
big
scoring
combination
in
the
last
week
of
the
term
there
was
a
house
game
on
the
lower
buller
simonds
turned
out
the
thirds
side
it
was
a
terrific
fight
buller
had
two
seconds
playing
and
a
house
cap
but
the
house
had
had
the
advantage
of
having
played
together
there
was
at
this
time
a
good
deal
of
bad
blood
between
the
house
and
buller
and
the
play
was
not
always
quite
clean
there
was
a
good
deal
of
fisting
in
the
scrum
gordon
was
in
great
form
he
scored
the
first
try
with
a
long
dribble
and
led
the
pack
well
lovelace
dropped
a
goal
from
a
mark
nearly
midway
between
the
and
the
line
collins
scrambled
over
the
corner
from
a
line
out
buller
only
scored
once
when
aspinall
their
wing
three
who
had
his
seconds
got
a
decent
pass
and
ran
practically
the
whole
length
of
the
field
towards
the
end
however
the
light
house
grovel
got
tired
and
was
penned
in
its
own
half
come
on
house
gordon
yelled
one
more
rush
let
the
swine
have
it
the
house
was
exhausted
it
managed
to
keep
buller
out
but
no
more
this
was
an
ominous
sign
it
had
not
been
a
long
game
the
bull
had
been
watching
the
game
as
the
players
trooped
off
the
field
he
called
back
gordon
caruthers
here
a
second
you
know
i
do
want
to
interfere
where
it
not
my
business
but
i
do
think
you
should
call
another
house
to
begin
with
it
not
the
english
idea
of
sport
and
if
there
any
ill
feeling
between
two
houses
in
a
school
especially
the
two
biggest
it
not
good
for
the
school
do
you
see
what
i
mean
oh
yes
sir
i
did
mean
of
course
you
did
my
dear
chap
by
the
way
will
you
be
young
enough
for
the
colts
next
year
you
will
good
then
it
wo
be
at
all
a
bad
side
collins
and
foster
were
quite
good
and
you
played
a
really
good
game
what
did
bull
want
caruthers
lovelace
asked
as
gordon
walked
into
the
oh
nothing
much
he
did
like
me
calling
his
fellows
but
why
the
devil
not
they
are
swine
are
they
of
course
they
are
but
you
can
hardly
expect
bull
to
realise
it
no
perhaps
not
but
my
god
they
are
the
last
thing
in
swine
those
hazlitts
and
their
crowd
the
house
supper
this
year
was
not
much
compared
with
the
one
of
the
year
before
simonds
was
not
an
lovelace
and
ferguson
again
spoke
miles
above
his
audience
however
he
was
a
sport
and
let
them
do
as
they
liked
so
they
drank
his
health
and
sang
a
jolly
good
fellow
several
old
boys
came
down
fitzmorris
with
an
eyeglass
and
a
wonderful
tie
sandham
as
usual
quite
insignificant
armour
wearing
the
blue
waistcoat
of
a
wadham
drinking
club
meredith
had
been
expected
but
at
the
last
moment
he
had
found
his
debts
so
much
in
excess
of
a
very
generous
allowance
that
he
would
have
to
retrench
a
little
it
was
a
pity
but
in
the
bullingdon
living
is
not
cheap
and
meredith
was
a
great
blood
the
this
term
afforded
little
comfort
to
gordon
he
was
easily
bottom
of
rather
a
collapse
but
still
one
has
to
keep
up
with
things
it
does
not
do
to
lose
sight
of
the
really
important
issues
of
life
and
gordon
had
certainly
been
a
social
success
he
travelled
up
to
london
with
ferguson
and
tester
and
felt
no
small
part
of
a
giant
when
collins
entered
their
carriage
suddenly
saw
ferguson
and
with
inaudible
apologies
vanished
quickly
down
the
corridor
olympus
was
not
so
very
far
off
chapter
ii
healthy
philistinism
during
the
christmas
holidays
there
appeared
in
a
certain
periodical
one
of
the
usual
attacks
on
the
public
school
system
it
repeated
all
the
old
arguments
about
keeping
abreast
of
the
times
and
doing
more
modern
languages
and
less
classics
the
writer
had
nothing
new
to
say
and
like
most
other
such
attacks
his
jeremiad
was
in
an
hour
or
two
forgotten
but
at
fernhurst
it
did
have
some
effect
for
it
gave
henry
trundle
the
idea
of
forming
a
special
class
for
french

trundle
was
one
of
the
french
masters
he
was
entirely
english
had
won
his
blue
for
golf
at
oxford
and
had
got
a
double
first
he
also
was
quite
incapable
of
teaching
anything
his
form
made
no
pretence
of
keeping
order
the
noise
that
proceeded
from
his
could
be
heard
anywhere
within
a
radius
of
a
hundred
yards
and
yet
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
he
was
a
good
husband
and
his
children
were
very
fond
of
him
his
domestic
virtues
however
were
sadly
lost
on
fernhurst
who
looked
on
him
as
a
general
buffoon
a
hopeless
ass
his
was
considered
a
sort
of
entertainment
hall
where
there
was
singing
and
dancing
and
a
mild
check
on
excessive
rioting
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
the
chief
announced
that
in
the
upper
school
one
hour
every
day
would
be
devoted
to
the
study
of
either
french
maths
or
latin
each
boy
would
choose
his
subject
mr
reddon
would
superintend
the
maths
mr
trundle
the
french
for
latin
each
boy
would
go
to
his
own
form
master
to
the
who
had
prizes
before
their
eyes
this
scheme
presented
few
attractions
as
scholars
it
would
not
be
to
their
advantage
to
miss
any
classical
hours
and
french
was
useless
in
scholarships
macdonald
when
he
took
down
the
names
of
those
who
were
to
do
latin
found
all
those
in
front
staying
with
him
and
all
those
behind
going
elsewhere
macdonald
laughed
up
his
sleeve
indeed
trundle
was
filled
with
the
most
arrant
collection
of
frauds
that
have
ever
sat
together
this
side
of
the
inferno
it
was
largely
a
school
house
gathering
lovelace
was
there
hunter
mansell
gordon
archie
and
collins
christy
house
supplied
dyke
a
fine
footballer
and
a
splendid
ragger
claremont
sent
two
typical
dormice
in
forbes
and
scobie
buller
provided
no
one
briault
hailed
from
rogers
it
was
his
boast
that
he
could
imitate
any
kind
of
animal
from
a
dog
to
a
hyena
benson
the
only
member
of
abercrombie
was
entirely
insignificant
and
actually
did
some
work
for
the
first
two
lessons
but
it
was
impossible
to
work
long
in
such
surroundings
and
tales
of
the
extra
french
set
are
still
told
in
whispers
after
lights
out
in
the
upper
dormitories
the
opening
was
sensational
no
sooner
had
trundle
taken
his
seat
than
dyke
leapt
to
his
feet
jumped
on
the
desk
jumped
off
it
into
the
vast
paper
basket
upset
that
charged
up
to
trundle
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
began
to
pour
out
words
my
dear
sir
how
are
you
how
is
mrs
trundle
and
the
little
trundles
have
you
had
a
pleasant
christmas
i
have
sir
this
sir
is
your
extra
french
set
the
french
set
mr
trundle
mr
trundle
the
french
set
amid
a
beating
of
desks
dyke
returned
to
his
seat
trundle
was
used
to
this
but
he
had
rather
hoped
his
new
set
would
be
composed
for
the
most
part
of
honest
young
scholars
it
was
a
disappointment
still
he
had
grown
used
to
it
life
had
not
been
too
kind
to
him
now
let
me
see
he
began
who
the
senior
man
here
immediately
everyone
except
benson
stood
up
i
am
sir
but
you
ca
all
be
the
senior
yes
sir
we
are
was
the
unanimous
answer
you
see
sir
gordon
explained
i
am
the
cleverest
and
should
be
the
senior
but
mansell
there
that
dolt
with
the
has
been
longer
in
the
school
and
he
got
his
seconds
and
rather
fancies
himself
dyke
has
taken
longer
to
reach
iv
a
than
anyone
else
in
the
history
and
thinks
that
a
sufficient
claim
to
be
senior
lovelace
oh
well
he
well
i
do
know
what
he
is
lovelace
you
swine
what
are
you
confound
you
man
shouted
the
enraged
who
the
hell
lovelace
broke
in
trundle
i
think
you
may
keep
your
reflections
on
the
future
life
till
afterwards
we
will
sit
in
alphabetical
order
it
is
incredible
how
long
it
takes
for
ten
boys
to
change
their
places
it
was
a
long
process
books
fell
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
there
were
murmurs
of
damn
you
man
that
my
grammar
or
confound
you
benson
where
the
hell
is
my
dictionary
twice
benson
had
been
sent
flying
into
the
basket
three
times
had
dyke
driven
a
compass
into
the
backside
of
forbes
who
looked
like
going
to
sleep
to
crown
everything
briault
gave
his
celebrated
imitation
of
a
consternation
reigned
lovelace
tried
to
hide
under
trundle
desk
gordon
endeavoured
to
get
through
a
window
that
was
hardly
a
foot
square
macdonald
was
just
the
other
side
of
the
a
green
he
chuckled
to
himself
i
hoped
caruthers
would
enjoy
himself
i
think
we
shall
have
to
put
him
on
to
construe
when
he
returns
if
he
goes
to
shows
in
school
time
he
must
pay
for
it
you
know
there
was
an
immense
scuffling
of
feet
but
much
louder
rang
the
noise
of
the
french
students
a
question
had
arisen
as
to
what
book
they
should
read
that
term
everyone
was
shouting
the
name
of
his
favourite
author
let
do
little
yelled
dyke
no
de
maupassant
shouted
mansell
adding
in
an
undertone
i
saw
one
of
his
books
in
a
shop
in
villiers
street
looked
pretty
hot
stuff
then
louder
again
let
have
de
maupassant
no
black
lovelace
implored
and
went
on
in
a
stage
whisper
now
do
be
silly
fools
i
have
got
a
crib
of
this
have
some
sense
you
do
imagine
we
going
to
prepare
the
stuff
do
you
was
hunter
retort
above
the
uproar
forbes
voice
drawled
i
say
if
there
a
french
translation
of
let
read
that
i
know
the
book
pretty
well
by
heart
it
was
ultimately
decided
to
read
by
françois
coppée
but
by
the
time
the
decision
had
been
reached
the
hour
had
been
exhausted
rather
sadly
trundle
watched
the
set
pour
out
into
the
cloister
shouting
and
laughing
even
masters
have
souls
boys
do
realise
this
every
day
till
the
end
of
the
term
that
farce
continued
sometimes
trundle
lost
his
temper
one
day
archie
was
singing
me
under
the
while
gordon
was
giving
a
lively
if
inaccurate
translation
fletcher
stop
that
singing
may
i
sing
sir
of
course
not
this
is
a
is
it
sir
i
thought
it
was
a
place
of
amusement
fifty
lines
fletcher
but
sir
it
is
you
know
one
hundred
lines
fletcher
really
sir
one
hundred
and
fifty
lines
fletcher
fletcher
collapsed
next
morning
a
magnificent
blue
envelope
sealed
at
every
corner
arrived
at
mr
trundle
house
it
contained
a
vast
quantity
of
blank
paper
but
sir
i
really
thought
i
put
in
the
lines
hunter
you
swine
that
is
your
fault
sir
i
believe
hunter
stole
them
he
had
a
big
imposition
for
the
chief
you
dirty
dog
hunter
may
i
kick
him
sir
no
sit
down
fletcher
the
lines
were
never
done
one
day
collins
was
put
on
to
construe
of
course
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
prepare
it
this
was
at
once
evident
collins
have
you
prepared
this
no
sir
but
why
not
collins
had
seen
in
the
holidays
ah
why
was
his
laconic
answer
trundle
foamed
with
wrath
he
snatched
a
cane
from
under
his
desk
and
advanced
on
collins
the
prospective
victim
leapt
back
and
pointed
at
him
with
theatrical
calm
look
he
is
coming
at
me
with
cane
in
hand
ha
he
comes
he
comes
see
how
he
comes
trundle
launched
a
fierce
blow
at
collins
and
only
narrowly
missed
benson
eyes
collins
delivered
a
short
lecture
on
the
danger
of
losing
one
temper
trundle
returned
to
his
desk
as
the
term
went
on
the
ragging
became
more
elaborate
at
first
the
set
was
content
with
giving
a
sort
of
low
comedian
knockabout
performance
but
they
soon
wearied
of
such
things
after
all
they
were
real
artistes
and
archie
fletcher
could
not
bear
being
ordinary
but
still
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sport
to
be
got
out
of
quite
common
place
manoeuvres
the
introduction
of
electric
snuff
for
instance
may
not
be
very
original
but
it
was
remarkably
successful
trundle
had
a
habit
of
leaving
his
in
his
desk
and
lovelace
had
a
key
that
fitted
it
the
rest
was
simple
during
evening
hall
hunter
and
lovelace
got
leave
to
fetch
a
book
from
their
there
was
no
one
about
in
five
minutes
trundle
was
filled
with
snuff
next
morning
the
set
assembled
forbes
was
asleep
benson
was
furtively
looking
up
a
word
in
his
dictionary
the
school
house
contingent
was
uncommonly
quiet
well
said
trundle
who
shall
we
start
off
with
this
morning
let
me
see
ah
he
opened
his
the
roar
of
laughter
was
heard
the
other
side
of
the
court
for
a
full
three
minutes
trundle
was
utterly
gorgeously
prostrate
with
coughing
and
sneezing
mansell
was
very
sympathetic
have
you
a
cold
sir
i
hope
it
nothing
serious
sir
i
find
the
east
wind
a
little
trying
myself
do
you
ever
use
fletcher
cough
lozenges
very
efficacious
sir
he
babbled
on
at
last
trundle
recovered
his
wind
if
not
his
temper
he
glowered
at
the
form
fletcher
translate
please
fletcher
began
but
he
did
not
get
very
far
hunter
let
loose
another
wave
of
snuff
the
whole
form
was
now
coughing
and
sneezing
certainly
considerably
more
than
was
necessary
next
boy
who
sneezes
i
shall
give
a
hundred
lines
to
and
report
him
to
the
headmaster
temporary
peace
ensued
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
sent
up
to
the
chief
and
weak
masters
have
not
the
slightest
scruple
in
doing
so
the
strong
men
need
not
report
but
a
man
like
archie
could
not
be
kept
in
order
long
he
gave
vent
to
a
most
unpleasant
snort
fletcher
if
you
do
that
again
i
shall
have
to
beat
you
a
slight
pause
please
sir
may
i
blow
my
nose
if
i
may
sniff
yes
fletcher
do
be
stupid
immediately
there
rose
a
chorus
of
may
we
blow
our
noses
too
sir
why
should
fletcher
be
the
only
one
allowed
to
it
is
fair
trundle
gave
way
and
the
rest
of
the
hour
was
spent
entirely
in
coughing
shouting
and
sneezing
no
work
was
done
but
that
was
no
unusual
occurrence
in
the
extra
french
set
this
was
of
course
the
sort
of
amusement
that
could
be
only
indulged
in
once
it
would
grow
stale
a
second
time
but
briault
idea
of
fancy
dress
was
one
that
presented
infinite
opportunities
and
gave
full
scope
for
originality
at
first
nothing
very
startling
occurred
on
a
freezing
cold
day
the
whole
set
would
assemble
without
waistcoats
and
with
their
coats
wide
open
would
complain
bitterly
of
the
heat
on
a
warm
day
they
would
go
in
arrayed
as
for
an
antarctic
expedition
in
wonderful
scarves
and
huge
gloves
it
disgraceful
sir
how
cold
this
room
is
gordon
complained
i
am
very
sensitive
to
cold
and
there
are
two
windows
open
they
must
be
shut
well
caruthers
if
you
find
this
room
too
cold
replied
trundle
sarcastically
you
may
return
to
the
warmth
of
your
own
study
and
write
me
out
the
lesson
ten
times
do
you
prefer
that
trundle
thought
that
rather
smart
but
gordon
was
never
beaten
sir
i
do
prefer
an
unfairly
long
imposition
to
an
attack
of
pneumonia
and
with
that
he
sailed
out
of
the
room
the
impot
was
of
course
never
done
only
benson
did
things
for
trundle
from
this
day
on
to
discover
a
new
kind
of
dress
was
the
aim
of
life
what
he
advised
the
form
always
copied
one
day
the
chief
gave
out
an
order
that
owing
to
the
extreme
cold
woollen
waistcoats
would
be
allowed
provided
they
were
of
a
quiet
colour
that
night
archie
searched
the
studies
for
sixpence
he
purchased
from
a
new
boy
a
threadbare
carpet
that
had
not
been
brushed
or
cleaned
for
generations
this
he
cut
up
into
six
parts
and
each
school
house
member
of
the
set
somehow
or
other
made
for
himself
a
waistcoat
out
of
them
next
day
garbed
in
these
they
rolled
sedately
to
trundle
their
coats
flung
open
their
hands
in
their
trouser
pockets
trundle
sat
speechless
at
last
he
found
words
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
confounded
impertinence
collins
mansell
caruthers
hunter
lovelace
and
you
fletcher
take
off
that
filthy
stuff
that
stuff
sir
drawled
out
forbes
what
stuff
do
interfere
forbes
rapped
out
trundle
take
them
off
i
say
oh
do
you
mean
our
waistcoats
sir
asked
hunter
in
superbly
feigned
surprise
we
could
take
them
off
we
should
catch
a
cold
the
headmaster
has
just
given
out
a
notice
about
them
he
said
we
could
wear
them
he
never
gave
you
permission
to
garb
yourselves
in
the
refuse
of
the
neighbourhood
refuse
said
forbes
those
waistcoats
are
of
a
most
fashionable
cut
it
extremely
hard
to
get
that
particular
brand
of
cloth
my
brother
who
is
a
member
of
the
bullingdon
told
me
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
your
brother
forbes
take
off
those
things
the
headmaster
would
never
allow
them
but
sir
insisted
archie
he
only
said
that
they
must
be
of
a
quiet
colour
and
they
are
of
a
quiet
colour
are
they
sir
in
truth
they
were
there
was
not
a
trace
of
colour
visible
anywhere
trundle
gave
in
he
murmured
something
about
asking
the
headmaster
and
then
put
on
archie
to
con
he
never
asked
the
chief
and
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
do
so
it
is
not
pleasant
wearing
carpets
for
an
hour
such
jests
can
only
be
undertaken
at
rare
intervals
but
the
culminating
point
was
not
reached
till
the
last
thursday
of
the
term
it
was
day
and
the
set
unanimously
backed
oxford
at
ten
the
set
was
due
to
appear
but
when
trundle
arrived
all
he
found
was
benson
who
was
in
nervous
apprehension
lest
he
should
have
come
to
the
wrong
room
if
he
had
he
might
lose
some
marks
and
marks
were
more
to
him
than
many
boundaries
he
smiled
happily
at
trundle
ah
where
are
the
rest
benson
i
do
know
sir
oh
well
i
suppose
we
must
wait
but
it
is
a
great
nuisance
i
wanted
to
finish
the
book
it
our
last
lesson
you
know
the
next
day
was
good
friday
for
ten
minutes
they
sat
in
silence
it
takes
a
long
time
to
prepare
a
big
rag
the
curtain
very
seldom
goes
up
punctually
on
the
first
night
and
there
had
been
no
dress
rehearsal
there
was
a
sound
of
scuffling
from
the
door
in
the
cloister
which
led
into
the
school
house
studies
then
came
the
tread
of
measured
feet
the
door
opened
and
the
great
procession
entered
at
the
head
was
gordon
in
ferguson
a
great
white
confection
with
pale
pink
frogs
with
a
white
colts
cap
on
his
head
he
beat
time
with
a
small
swagger
cane
then
came
the
trumpeters
crosbie
and
forbes
who
were
producing
strange
harmonies
on
two
pipes
that
they
had
bagged
from
the
armoury
behind
them
mansell
walked
in
corps
clothes
and
a
second
fifteen
cap
he
was
chanting
a
low
dirge
on
each
side
of
him
marched
the
choristers
lovelace
and
hunter
in
white
sheets
and
enormous
psalters
that
they
had
borrowed
from
the
chapel
they
also
sang
in
a
strange
outlandish
tongue
but
the
de
was
the
banner
it
consisted
of
a
long
piece
of
white
calico
on
which
was
inscribed
in
red
ink
up
up
oxford
down
with
the
cantabs
trundle
hailed
from
emmanuel
it
was
fastened
at
each
end
to
a
hockey
stick
and
fletcher
and
collins
bore
it
in
solemnly
in
the
rear
briault
gave
his
impressions
of
a
cow
being
dyke
was
the
showman
i
will
now
present
gentlemen
he
began
my
circus
of
touring
artistes
who
are
raising
a
fund
for
the
endowment
of
the
oxford
boating
club
i
must
beg
you
all
but
trundle
cut
short
the
oration
seizing
a
cane
he
rushed
into
the
cavalcade
of
isis
and
smote
out
full
lustily
pandemonium
broke
forth
no
was
more
rich
in
groans
no
revue
chorus
produced
so
much
noise
it
took
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
obtain
quiet
but
at
last
a
motley
crowd
sat
down
to
study
françois
coppée
and
then
came
the
it
was
entirely
unexpected
and
entirely
unrehearsed
there
was
a
knock
outside
the
door
opened
and
an
amazing
apparition
appeared
on
the
threshold
betteridge
was
in
the
sixth
very
enviously
the
night
before
he
had
listened
to
the
preparations
and
plans
of
the
extra
french
set
cursing
inwardly
he
had
sat
down
at
ten
to
do
prose
with
the
chief
faintly
across
the
court
were
borne
the
sounds
of
strife
he
groaned
within
him
suddenly
the
chief
stood
up
i
find
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
for
a
little
some
parents
are
coming
to
interview
me
i
want
you
all
to
return
quietly
to
your
studies
and
continue
the
prose
there
joyfully
the
sixth
trooped
out
betteridge
rushed
across
the
courts
to
trundle
for
a
second
he
listened
outside
then
a
great
idea
struck
him
there
was
still
left
madly
he
tore
up
to
the
dormitories
luckily
they
were
not
locked
five
minutes
later
he
appeared
before
mr
henry
trundle
entirely
changed
he
had
on
a
very
light
brown
suit
a
pair
of
check
spats
a
waistcoat
a
heliotrope
bow
tie
a
bowler
was
balanced
on
his
head
at
an
angle
of
degrees
a
camera
was
slung
round
his
neck
in
his
hand
he
had
a
notebook
and
pencil
mr
trundle
i
believe
he
said
i
am
the
reporter
of
fernhurst
we
have
received
a
wire
that
there
has
been
a
great
demonstration
in
here
and
we
want
to
get
an
account
of
it
in
the
stop
press
news
before
our
sister
journal
western
evening
can
you
give
me
some
notes
as
he
stopped
the
set
that
had
remained
spellbound
burst
into
a
hilarious
shriek
of
joy
everyone
heard
it
even
claremont
woke
up
and
asked
what
it
was
arthur
the
school
talks
of
it
to
this
day
and
at
this
point
the
chief
comes
into
the
story
he
was
showing
the
parents
in
question
round
the
studies
when
he
heard
an
uproar
proceeding
from
somewhere
near
the
cloisters
he
excused
himself
from
the
parents
ran
downstairs
and
tracked
the
noise
to
trundle
he
entered
never
before
had
he
seen
disorder
on
such
a
generous
scale
he
looked
round
mr
trundle
er
what
er
set
is
this
the
extra
french
set
headmaster
the
chief
half
smiled
he
walked
out
without
another
word
next
term
there
was
no
extra
french
set
the
ragging
of
trundle
however
was
merely
regarded
relaxation
from
the
serious
business
of
life
in
an
easter
term
football
is
the
only
thing
that
any
respectable
man
will
really
worry
about
and
gordon
judged
on
these
grounds
and
his
friends
with
him
would
most
certainly
pass
into
the
most
select
society
circle
the
thirds
this
year
was
a
terribly
perplexing
problem
simonds
had
not
taken
enough
trouble
with
his
juniors
the
term
before
this
term
he
was
working
hard
enough
but
it
was
a
bit
late
in
the
day
to
begin
on
the
first
saturday
of
the
term
a
scratch
side
took
points
off
the
prospective
thirds
side
if
you
play
as
badly
as
that
on
the
day
you
lose
by
forty
points
growled
simonds
and
you
damned
well
deserve
a
beating
too
curse
the
man
muttered
lovelace
whose
bloody
fault
is
it
but
his
i
should
like
to
know
he
is
a
disgrace
to
the
house
working
for
some
rotten
scholarship
when
he
ought
to
be
training
on
our
juniors
rotten
swine
well
he
pretty
well
all
right
this
term
at
any
rate
said
gordon
for
the
lord
sake
do
go
grousing
about
or
we
keep
the
score
under
eighty
let
alone
ninety
if
we
lose
we
lose
and
my
god
we
make
play
for
it
the
side
certainly
tried
hard
and
simonds
did
his
best
but
all
the
same
on
the
day
of
the
match
buller
were
backing
their
chances
of
running
up
a
score
of
over
thirty
points
at
three
to
one
the
swine
said
gordon
swanking
it
about
how
they
are
going
to
lick
us
to
bits
my
word
i
would
give
something
to
smash
them
to
smithereens
i
have
taken
on
a
bet
with
every
man
in
buller
whom
i
found
offering
long
odds
i
stand
to
win
quite
a
lot
and
i
shall
win
it
god
truth
said
mansell
do
they
think
there
no
guts
left
in
the
house
at
all
they
may
go
gassing
about
the
number
of
colts
badges
they
have
got
but
they
are
not
used
to
our
way
of
playing
we
go
for
the
ball
and
if
a
man
in
the
light
we
knock
him
out
of
it
school
house
footer
is
not
pretty
to
look
at
but
it
the
real
thing
not
a
sort
of
nursery
affair
we
go
in
to
win
just
before
lunch
a
typical
telegram
from
meredith
was
pinned
up
on
the
house
board
go
it
house
and
give
them
the
blank
was
left
to
the
imagination
the
house
remembered
meredith
and
filled
it
in
accordingly
nothing
is
more
horrible
than
the
morning
before
a
first
house
match
gordon
woke
happy
and
expectant
but
by
break
he
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
shivery
and
at
he
was
done
to
the
world
he
ate
nothing
answered
questions
in
vague
monosyllables
and
smiled
half
nervously
at
everyone
in
general
he
was
suffering
from
the
worst
kind
of
stage
fright
and
after
all
to
play
in
an
important
match
before
the
whole
school
is
a
fairly
terrifying
experience
as
he
sat
trembling
in
the
pavilion
waiting
for
the
whistle
to
blow
gordon
would
have
welcomed
any
form
of
death
anything
to
save
him
from
the
ordeal
before
him
the
whistle
blew
at
last
as
he
walked
out
from
the
pavilion
in
his
jersey
an
unspeakable
terror
gripped
him
his
knees
became
very
weak
his
tongue
stuck
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
then
something
seemed
to
snap
in
his
brain
he
walked
on
quite
cheerfully
he
was
as
a
spectator
it
seemed
that
it
was
not
really
he
but
his
ghost
that
was
walking
on
to
the
field
subconsciously
he
lined
up
with
the
rest
the
school
side
in
their
white
jerseys
the
colts
with
their
red
dragons
seemed
miles
away
collins
kicked
off
gordon
did
not
know
he
was
playing
a
roar
of
house
rose
from
the
involuntarily
he
joined
it
thinking
himself
a
then
suddenly
livingstone
the
buller
inside
caught
the
ball
and
ran
towards
him
at
once
gordon
was
himself
he
forgot
the
crowd
on
the
forgot
his
nervousness
forgot
everything
except
that
he
was
playing
for
the
house
and
somehow
or
other
had
to
drive
the
ball
over
that
line
he
crashed
into
livingstone
and
the
pair
rolled
into
touch
a
cheer
rippled
down
the
line
gordon
did
not
hear
it
described
this
match
as
perhaps
the
finest
ever
witnessed
on
the
school
ground
and
the
reporter
was
not
far
wrong
certainly
that
first
mad
rush
of
the
house
forwards
was
the
most
glorious
moment
in
gordon
football
career
it
was
all
so
unexpected
so
essentially
wonderful
on
the
mansell
shouted
himself
hoarse
the
cries
of
house
completely
drowned
those
of
school
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
the
school
pack
never
got
the
ball
out
of
their
half
it
seemed
that
the
house
must
score
time
after
time
the
school
were
forced
to
touch
down
stewart
was
brought
down
just
the
wrong
side
of
the
line
lovelace
performed
prodigies
of
valour
a
gloom
descended
over
buller
on
the
masters
side
of
the
line
the
bull
fumed
and
ground
his
teeth
go
low
reice
you
stinking
little
funk
get
round
forwards
and
shove
you
are
slacking
the
lot
of
you
buck
up
philson
up
and
down
he
stamped
cursing
at
his
men
lovelace
could
hardly
refrain
from
laughing
now
lads
shouted
stewart
fair
or
foul
shove
the
ball
over
the
line
like
a
gordon
crashed
into
the
scrum
wilkinson
was
in
his
light
but
gordon
was
seeing
red
his
feet
stamped
on
wilkinson
and
found
the
ball
his
elbows
swung
viciously
as
he
cut
his
way
through
the
scrum
then
someone
caught
him
by
the
ankle
he
went
down
hard
a
boot
caught
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
he
got
up
blind
with
wrath
fight
fight
he
yelled
the
house
grovel
swarmed
in
the
outhouse
pack
shivered
for
a
moment
then
gave
way
collins
and
gordon
burst
through
the
ball
at
their
toes
wilkinson
dashed
across
and
dived
for
the
ball
he
clawed
it
for
a
second
gordon
feet
smashed
it
from
his
hands
and
collins
steered
it
past
the
back
and
kicked
it
just
over
the
line
and
fell
on
top
of
it
from
the
there
burst
a
roar
that
must
have
been
heard
five
miles
away
well
done
laddie
bawled
mansell
even
ferguson
waved
his
stick
in
the
air
it
was
a
great
moment
as
the
school
lined
up
behind
their
line
the
bull
strode
behind
them
what
are
you
doing
put
some
life
into
your
game
buck
up
all
of
you
it
is
a
filthy
show
guts
lovelace
took
the
kick
it
was
far
out
the
ball
hardly
rose
from
the
ground
in
a
state
of
feverish
panic
livingstone
dropped
out
for
a
second
or
two
the
school
pressed
but
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
the
wild
attack
of
the
house
for
long
collins
elated
by
his
success
brought
off
a
magnificent
dribble
and
was
forced
into
touch
only
a
few
yards
from
the
line
was
not
far
off
and
the
house
struggled
fiercely
to
get
over
the
line
once
more
up
and
down
between
the
goal
line
and
the
the
two
scrums
fought
it
seemed
only
a
matter
of
time
for
another
try
to
send
the
house
across
with
a
lead
of
six
points
but
there
is
as
much
luck
in
rugger
as
in
any
game
the
house
had
heeled
perfectly
foster
cut
past
one
man
and
passed
out
to
richards
a
roar
of
house
went
up
a
try
was
imminent
richards
passed
to
lovelace
but
livingstone
was
one
of
those
who
will
miss
an
easy
kick
one
minute
and
bring
off
a
superb
collar
the
next
as
richards
passed
he
dashed
between
him
and
lovelace
intercepted
the
pass
and
raced
up
the
field
collins
caught
him
only
a
foot
away
from
the
line
and
from
the
line
out
grienburg
a
heavy
buller
forward
caught
the
ball
and
fell
over
the
line
by
the
flag
just
as
the
whistle
was
about
to
blow
for
it
was
very
far
out
and
the
kick
failed
the
sides
crossed
over
simonds
came
on
during
the
interval
almost
incoherent
with
excitement
splendid
you
fellows
magnificent
never
saw
anything
like
it
stick
to
it
and
you
bound
to
win
simply
putrid
luck
that
last
try
keep
it
up
on
the
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
final
result
we
shall
walk
away
with
the
cup
said
mansell
and
in
a
far
corner
was
laying
ten
to
one
on
the
house
in
muffins
but
a
bit
of
good
luck
is
capable
of
making
a
side
play
in
a
totally
different
spirit
and
the
combined
buller
and
claremont
side
started
off
like
a
whirlwind
livingstone
kicked
off
and
the
outhouse
scrum
was
on
the
ball
in
a
minute
for
a
second
the
house
pack
was
swept
off
its
feet
and
during
that
second
fitzgerald
had
dribbled
to
within
ten
yards
of
the
line
foster
made
a
splendid
effort
to
stay
the
rush
and
flung
himself
on
the
very
feet
of
the
opposing
forwards
but
the
check
was
only
momentary
the
forwards
rolled
on
and
it
was
only
on
the
very
line
that
lovelace
rushed
across
and
falling
on
the
ball
held
it
to
him
till
the
house
forwards
had
time
to
come
round
but
the
rules
lay
down
that
a
player
as
soon
as
he
has
fallen
on
the
ball
must
get
off
it
at
once
lovelace
realised
that
if
he
did
so
a
try
would
be
inevitable
he
hung
on
like
grim
death
praying
that
the
referee
would
not
see
before
half
the
house
forwards
had
formed
round
the
whistle
blew
free
kick
to
the
school
you
mus
lie
on
the
ball
like
that
lovelace
the
referee
was
not
blind
anxiously
the
house
lined
up
and
waited
for
the
kick
livingstone
had
converted
nearly
every
goal
on
the
colts
games
the
term
before
it
was
a
trying
moment
he
seemed
to
take
hours
placing
the
ball
correctly
there
was
an
absolute
hush
as
he
ran
up
then
a
great
sigh
half
of
relief
half
of
disappointment
burst
from
the
the
ball
rose
hardly
six
feet
from
the
ground
and
sailed
harmlessly
towards
the
school
house
line
and
then
turner
made
a
mistake
that
he
cursed
himself
for
ever
afterwards
all
that
was
necessary
to
do
was
to
let
the
ball
bounce
and
then
touch
down
but
as
the
ball
sailed
towards
him
turner
was
suddenly
possessed
with
the
longing
to
do
something
brilliant
he
was
last
man
on
the
list
and
had
only
been
put
into
the
side
at
the
last
moment
owing
to
another
forward
stopping
out
it
was
not
unnatural
he
caught
the
ball
you
blasted
fool
yelled
out
richards
for
god
sake
find
touch
turner
lost
his
head
he
gave
a
mild
punt
down
field
and
before
the
house
had
realised
what
was
happening
wilkinson
had
caught
the
ball
and
dashed
over
the
line
between
the
posts
this
time
livingstone
made
no
mistake
for
the
next
five
minutes
the
house
side
was
entirely
demoralised
nothing
went
right
the
forwards
did
not
keep
together
gordon
cursed
foully
and
only
made
matters
worse
lovelace
kicks
only
found
touch
a
few
feet
down
the
line
richards
rushed
up
and
down
fuming
and
upset
everyone
it
was
due
only
to
a
miracle
and
some
fine
work
by
foster
that
the
school
did
not
score
at
least
three
times
foster
did
everything
during
those
awful
minutes
rush
after
rush
he
stopped
just
as
fitzgerald
was
looking
dangerous
and
he
brought
down
his
every
time
gordon
was
amazed
at
his
performance
he
had
always
rather
looked
down
on
him
before
he
had
never
imagined
he
was
so
plucky
but
it
takes
more
than
two
unexpected
tries
to
throw
a
school
house
side
off
its
balance
for
long
soon
the
forwards
began
to
reassert
themselves
burgess
the
wing
a
member
of
buller
who
was
in
vi
b
and
whose
conceit
far
excelled
his
performances
got
away
and
began
to
look
dangerous
but
gordon
came
up
behind
him
he
loathed
burgess
and
flinging
aside
all
the
fernhurst
traditions
about
collaring
low
he
leapt
in
the
air
and
crashed
on
top
of
him
burgess
collapsed
like
paper
a
great
howl
went
up
from
the
school
house
new
life
seemed
to
enter
into
the
side
the
grovel
flocked
round
and
collins
heaving
burgess
off
the
ball
with
a
flying
kick
dribbled
the
ball
to
the
line
a
scrum
formed
up
and
from
the
heel
richards
got
the
ball
to
lovelace
who
broke
through
the
defence
and
with
a
clear
field
ahead
made
for
the
line
run
like
hell
shouted
simonds
from
the
he
was
standing
on
the
masters
side
of
the
ground
just
in
front
of
the
chief
wife
but
he
was
past
caring
about
social
etiquette
all
he
wanted
was
to
see
the
house
ahead
once
more
faster
man
run
oh
damn
just
on
the
line
the
ubiquitous
livingstone
caught
him
up
and
the
pair
rolled
into
touch
if
as
some
say
there
is
nothing
much
finer
to
watch
in
football
than
an
uphill
fight
then
the
thirds
of
was
most
certainly
the
greatest
game
ever
played
on
the
lower
lighter
and
slower
than
their
opponents
the
house
kept
them
on
the
defensive
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
collins
was
a
splendid
sight
his
hair
fell
in
a
cascade
over
his
eyes
his
nose
was
bleeding
his
jersey
was
torn
half
off
his
back
but
he
did
not
care
his
feet
were
everywhere
and
anyone
who
got
in
his
light
was
sorry
for
it
turner
with
the
thought
that
he
was
the
cause
of
wilkinson
try
fought
heroically
once
when
williamson
a
claremont
forward
began
to
dribble
he
rushed
into
him
sideways
and
with
a
soccerbarge
knocked
him
flying
into
touch
and
took
the
ball
back
inside
the
it
was
a
great
fight
but
no
one
can
strive
successfully
against
the
will
of
the
gods
and
certainly
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
against
the
house
ten
minutes
before
time
livingstone
who
had
been
systematically
starved
the
whole
game
got
a
pass
about
the
line
he
was
the
fastest
man
in
the
field
no
one
could
touch
him
he
made
straight
for
the
corner
flag
and
scored
amid
the
tumultuous
applause
of
buller
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
result
now
before
the
eyes
of
there
rose
a
prospect
of
eternally
treating
outhouse
men
to
muffins
mansell
swore
violently
the
bull
walked
up
and
down
the
beaming
with
delight
simonds
was
silent
well
you
men
said
richards
we
been
beaten
but
by
heaven
shove
them
the
last
few
minutes
go
for
them
tooth
and
nail
the
house
did
so
in
hall
that
night
burgess
announced
that
there
was
not
a
single
gentleman
in
the
school
house
a
remark
which
resulted
in
a
rather
unpleasant
with
the
bull
two
days
later
for
these
last
minutes
produced
one
of
the
most
glorious
charges
of
the
day
from
the
right
in
to
the
school
half
the
ball
was
carried
nothing
could
stop
that
wild
rush
livingstone
and
wilkinson
went
down
before
it
but
they
were
passed
by
burgess
made
a
attempt
to
fall
on
the
ball
but
did
not
get
up
for
several
seconds
and
the
house
was
well
in
the
school
half
when
gordon
kicked
a
little
too
hard
and
the
school
back
fielding
the
ball
managed
to
find
touch
but
the
house
was
still
undaunted
from
the
line
out
the
ball
was
flung
to
richards
who
putting
his
head
down
literally
fought
his
way
through
the
scrum
and
tottered
out
the
other
side
he
handed
off
wilkinson
dodged
the
and
made
for
the
centre
of
the
ground
livingstone
came
across
at
him
with
you
richards
yelled
lovelace
as
livingstone
brought
richards
crashing
to
the
ground
the
ball
was
safely
in
lovelace
hands
lovelace
was
about
between
and
the
he
ran
a
few
yards
steadied
himself
and
took
a
drop
in
deadly
silence
the
school
watched
the
flight
of
the
ball
it
sailed
high
and
straight
towards
the
goal
it
over
murmured
the
chief
excitedly
but
as
the
ball
neared
the
posts
it
travelled
slower
a
slight
breeze
caught
it
blew
it
over
to
the
right
it
hit
the
right
post
and
fell
back
into
play
as
the
returned
it
to
the
whistle
blew
for
school
three
cheers
for
the
house
shouted
livingstone
house
three
cheers
for
the
school
responded
richards
and
then
everyone
poured
over
the
ropes
on
to
the
field
never
mind
you
men
said
simonds
it
was
a
damned
fine
show
and
better
than
fifty
wins
the
house
was
proud
of
its
side
as
the
fifteen
trooped
across
the
courts
on
the
way
to
the
the
house
lined
up
by
the
chains
of
the
sixth
form
green
and
cheered
them
well
played
caruthers
shouted
someone
it
was
gordon
first
taste
of
real
success
that
night
there
was
a
big
feed
in
no
they
were
all
out
of
training
for
three
days
and
they
made
the
most
of
it
during
the
last
fortnight
they
had
been
allowed
only
fruit
between
meals
it
the
finest
performance
since
i
been
in
the
house
mansell
declared
meredith
two
cock
was
in
it
their
side
was
twice
as
strong
on
paper
and
my
lord
we
gave
it
them
yes
said
lovelace
and
you
wait
till
this
side
is
the
three
cock
there
be
a
bit
of
a
change
then
you
right
there
shouted
mansell
we
pull
it
off
this
year
nor
the
year
after
that
but
you
wait
and
see
what
happen
in
that
the
year
when
the
house
will
revive
the
great
days
of
ross
my
lads
we
regret
the
lean
years
when
the
years
of
plenty
come
and
the
three
cock
cup
is
back
on
the
old
oak
sideboard
our
day
will
come
that
night
gordon
dreamt
of
the
great
future
that
was
opening
out
for
the
house
and
he
was
thankful
that
he
would
see
it
like
the
runners
in
the
torch
race
many
would
have
prepared
the
way
for
victory
but
it
was
to
him
and
his
friends
that
the
glory
of
the
final
triumph
would
belong
for
he
would
win
the
race
he
would
carry
home
the
torch
chapter
iii
tin
gods
after
this
match
a
new
phase
in
gordon
life
may
be
said
to
have
begun
he
had
for
the
first
time
felt
what
it
was
to
be
really
successful
when
he
had
got
his
colts
cap
the
world
had
seemed
at
his
feet
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
he
experienced
now
for
he
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
house
battle
he
had
played
a
principal
part
in
a
wonderful
achievement
the
house
looked
on
him
as
one
of
its
chosen
defenders
he
was
in
the
limelight
and
he
had
no
intention
of
ever
drifting
out
of
it
when
we
have
experienced
the
really
great
the
things
that
pleased
once
charm
no
more
after
basking
in
the
blaze
of
a
summer
afternoon
there
is
something
poignantly
pathetic
in
watching
the
amber
beams
of
a
december
sun
filter
through
the
trees
gordon
had
his
fingers
on
the
pedestal
of
fame
and
he
intended
never
to
loose
his
grasp
his
position
had
been
obtained
by
brilliant
football
and
if
he
had
been
able
to
retain
it
in
the
same
way
all
would
have
been
well
but
the
gods
willed
it
otherwise
it
was
generally
admitted
that
the
house
stood
no
chance
of
winning
the
two
cock
and
when
the
house
agreed
on
its
own
defeat
prospects
were
certainly
very
gloomy
so
gordon
only
interested
himself
in
his
own
performances
he
began
to
wonder
if
there
was
any
chance
of
his
getting
a
place
in
the
three
cock
simonds
was
undoubtedly
pleased
with
him
and
henry
the
only
forward
senior
to
him
had
been
doing
rather
badly
lately
in
the
trial
games
he
played
with
a
mad
enthusiasm
on
the
friday
evening
the
two
cock
side
was
posted
he
was
above
lovelace
and
richards
henry
was
only
one
above
him
just
before
lunch
on
the
day
of
the
match
mansell
came
up
to
him
i
say
i
have
got
some
good
news
for
you
what
is
it
gordon
was
feverish
with
impatience
well
i
do
think
i
had
better
tell
you
oh
i
say
do
do
be
a
swine
no
i
do
think
i
shall
it
would
make
you
too
bucked
with
life
mansell
smiled
at
him
kindly
gordon
was
rather
annoyed
but
on
the
way
down
to
hall
he
overheard
mansell
talking
to
tester
in
the
door
of
the
simonds
is
going
to
play
caruthers
in
the
three
cock
instead
of
henry
if
he
plays
at
all
decently
mansell
was
saying
oh
i
am
glad
of
that
tester
answered
he
a
good
kid
the
earth
swayed
dizzily
as
gordon
made
his
way
down
to
hall
he
did
not
feel
at
all
nervous
he
was
quite
certain
of
himself
the
day
was
bound
to
end
with
him
a
member
of
the
house
fifteen
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
play
his
average
game
mansell
had
said
so
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
field
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
his
own
personality
he
did
not
feel
a
sort
of
spectator
as
he
had
done
in
the
thirds
it
was
all
so
clear
he
even
smiled
at
tester
as
he
lined
up
but
a
two
cock
is
very
different
from
a
thirds
men
from
christy
were
playing
who
were
shining
lights
on
senior
leagues
and
who
would
easily
have
got
their
seconds
if
they
had
tried
but
who
because
they
were
in
christy
did
not
take
the
trouble
christy
should
have
beaten
buller
but
they
were
too
slack
to
go
into
proper
training
and
in
spite
of
the
brilliance
of
dyke
and
pemberton
buller
won
by
six
points
after
being
ten
points
behind
at
as
individuals
however
christy
were
a
formidable
lot
and
when
combined
with
buller
formed
a
much
heavier
and
larger
side
than
any
gordon
had
played
against
before
he
was
not
very
large
and
was
used
to
junior
leagues
for
an
hour
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
he
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
game
he
was
flung
from
one
position
into
another
he
followed
after
the
scrum
he
felt
like
a
new
boy
playing
for
the
first
time
at
simonds
came
up
thoroughly
fed
up
with
life
the
score
was
for
heaven
sake
caruthers
get
in
and
shove
if
you
ca
do
anything
better
you
have
done
a
thing
the
whole
game
the
game
was
a
nightmare
mansell
looked
at
him
curiously
that
evening
at
tea
gordon
muttered
something
about
a
kick
on
the
head
and
being
unable
to
see
anything
on
sunday
evening
a
list
of
those
in
training
for
the
three
cock
was
put
up
there
were
ten
forwards
down
gordon
was
bottom
on
the
list
both
henry
and
collins
were
above
him
in
the
football
world
his
claim
to
fame
for
the
moment
faded
away
if
he
was
to
remain
in
the
public
gaze
he
would
have
to
attract
attention
some
other
way
and
so
at
the
most
critical
point
in
the
development
of
his
character
gordon
began
all
unconsciously
to
seek
for
new
ways
of
making
himself
conspicuous
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
if
someone
had
told
him
that
he
was
doing
absurd
things
merely
to
get
talked
about
he
would
have
laughed
but
all
the
same
it
would
have
been
true
his
preparatory
schoolmaster
said
of
him
once
there
is
some
danger
of
his
becoming
the
school
buffoon
at
his
prep
the
boys
were
too
closely
looked
after
and
kept
down
for
any
one
person
to
become
at
anything
and
so
a
subconscious
love
of
notoriety
drove
gordon
on
to
play
the
fool
for
a
whole
term
most
damnably
it
was
during
the
end
of
the
easter
and
the
whole
of
the
summer
term
that
gordon
earned
a
reputation
for
reckless
bravado
and
disregard
of
all
authority
that
stuck
to
him
through
his
whole
career
up
till
now
he
had
done
things
merely
because
he
had
wanted
to
he
followed
the
inclination
of
the
moment
but
now
it
was
different
it
is
pleasant
to
be
talked
of
as
a
mixture
between
don
juan
and
puck
and
gordon
was
sufficiently
good
at
games
to
make
himself
an
attractive
and
not
a
repulsive
figure
the
public
school
boy
admires
the
meredith
type
he
despises
the
man
who
is
no
good
at
games
and
who
plays
fast
and
loose
in
his
house
gordon
was
not
unpopular
and
indeed
some
of
his
escapades
were
really
funny
as
for
instance
when
he
cut
through
the
string
of
the
chapel
organ
on
which
a
weight
is
attached
to
show
whether
the
organ
is
full
of
air
or
not
the
next
morning
in
chapel
the
choir
began
but
the
organ
was
mute
the
hymn
broke
off
into
a
miserable
wail
the
whole
service
was
one
silent
ripple
of
merriment
rogers
was
taking
the
service
and
was
quite
at
sea
without
the
help
of
music
gordon
earned
a
considerable
measure
of
notoriety
for
the
performance
on
his
way
to
the
tuck
shop
ben
the
captain
of
the
fifteen
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
caruthers
i
say
are
you
the
man
who
made
the
organ
mute
yes
by
jove
you
are
a
sportsman
gordon
was
thus
encouraged
to
continue
on
his
road
to
buffoonery
and
when
the
summer
term
came
he
found
no
reason
to
pursue
any
other
course
on
the
cricket
field
he
could
not
get
a
run
first
he
hit
wildly
then
he
began
to
poke
but
all
without
the
least
success
after
a
few
weeks
he
almost
ceased
to
try
except
in
house
matches
the
bull
got
furious
look
here
caruthers
he
said
i
do
know
if
you
are
slack
or
merely
incompetent
but
when
i
see
you
make
fifty
against
my
house
in
a
junior
house
match
and
then
play
inside
on
the
upper
i
begin
to
think
all
you
care
about
is
your
house
do
you
care
for
fernhurst
boy
gordon
was
genuinely
worried
about
this
he
admired
the
bull
immensely
indeed
the
bull
was
about
the
only
person
at
fernhurst
whose
opinion
he
valued
at
all
he
made
strenuous
efforts
to
get
runs
but
it
was
no
use
he
was
clean
out
of
form
his
fifty
buller
was
his
only
score
during
the
season
but
the
bull
did
not
know
this
he
thought
caruthers
tried
for
his
house
and
slacked
with
the
colts
the
climax
was
reached
during
the
milton
match
gordon
went
in
first
with
foster
in
five
minutes
he
and
lovelace
and
a
man
from
claremont
were
out
for
four
runs
the
bull
chewed
grass
in
a
far
corner
of
the
field
and
then
to
crown
everything
gordon
missed
the
easiest
of
catches
he
caught
lovelace
eye
it
was
really
rather
funny
the
two
of
them
burst
into
sudden
laughter
lovelace
was
nearly
doubled
up
the
bull
thought
they
were
laughing
at
him
i
ca
think
what
gone
wrong
with
caruthers
this
term
he
said
to
fry
the
captain
of
the
school
house
he
was
so
promising
once
he
does
seem
to
be
trying
this
term
next
day
gordon
was
left
out
of
the
colts
side
the
day
after
the
chair
in
trundle
suddenly
collapsed
the
leg
had
been
sawn
half
through
and
trundle
fell
over
on
the
floor
gordon
was
riding
for
a
fall
and
two
days
before
commemoration
to
use
his
own
phrase
he
fairly
put
his
foot
in
it
this
term
he
had
a
double
dormitory
with
one
davenport
a
scholar
who
was
a
year
junior
to
gordon
but
was
in
the
same
form
the
chief
had
thought
gordon
a
bit
big
for
the
nursery
but
there
was
no
room
for
him
down
below
so
he
and
davenport
lived
at
the
end
of
the
passage
in
glorious
isolation
it
was
a
great
luxury
they
were
allowed
several
privileges
they
could
keep
their
light
on
till
ten
they
could
go
to
bed
when
they
liked
and
it
was
here
that
they
usually
did
their
preparation
davenport
however
suddenly
contracted
measles
and
gordon
who
had
grown
too
slack
to
do
his
work
alone
used
to
get
leave
for
sydenham
a
rather
insignificant
member
of
a
who
had
come
a
term
before
him
to
come
and
prepare
his
work
in
the
double
room
leave
was
always
granted
and
when
davenport
returned
the
scheme
was
still
continued
on
this
particular
night
davenport
had
got
a
headache
he
said
he
was
going
to
stop
out
next
day
and
refused
to
prepare
thucydides
it
also
happened
that
the
house
tutor
was
away
that
night
and
so
the
chief
went
round
the
dormitories
putting
out
the
lights
he
did
not
know
of
the
custom
by
which
sydenham
came
up
to
do
the
con
he
was
not
very
pleased
but
after
a
little
hesitation
gave
leave
the
door
was
shut
sydenham
perched
himself
on
the
chest
of
drawers
gordon
produced
an
aid
to
quick
translation
davenport
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
abbey
bells
also
happened
to
be
ringing
that
night
it
was
quite
impossible
to
hear
any
normal
sound
down
the
passage
and
so
gordon
was
quite
unaware
of
the
chief
intention
to
revisit
them
and
see
if
they
were
really
working
till
the
door
opened
and
the
chief
walked
in
gordon
lost
his
head
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
gaped
thucydides
lay
on
one
side
of
the
bed
the
crib
on
the
other
the
chief
picked
up
the
book
ah
does
mr
macdonald
allow
you
to
use
this
in
the
really
dramatic
moments
of
our
lives
it
is
always
the
inane
that
first
suggests
itself
it
was
so
likely
that
macdonald
would
have
given
them
permission
no
sir
er
davenport
are
you
preparing
er
yes
thucydides
with
caruthers
too
no
sir
davenport
thanked
heaven
that
he
had
a
headache
he
had
helped
in
the
work
of
deceit
every
night
the
whole
term
the
chief
thought
he
must
be
a
boy
of
strong
moral
courage
and
in
many
ways
he
was
but
cribbing
after
all
was
part
of
the
daily
routine
the
chief
took
up
the
book
sydenham
go
back
to
your
study
he
turned
down
the
light
and
went
out
his
footsteps
died
out
down
the
passage
damn
said
gordon
excelsis
said
davenport
and
it
was
a
rotten
crib
too
said
gordon
by
next
morning
the
story
was
all
round
the
school
you
will
be
birched
for
certain
was
tester
cheerful
comment
and
serve
you
right
for
getting
caught
i
be
such
a
fool
again
growled
caruthers
and
certainly
he
profited
by
his
experience
a
year
later
the
house
tutor
came
into
his
study
when
he
was
preparing
vergil
with
the
aid
of
dr
giles
text
he
put
a
piece
of
over
the
crib
and
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
quite
easily
about
the
chances
of
the
eleven
tonford
but
when
we
are
in
trouble
there
are
few
of
us
who
can
see
so
far
ahead
as
to
feel
thankful
at
the
thought
that
we
have
learnt
something
that
will
be
a
help
to
us
in
the
future
gordon
was
thoroughly
fed
up
but
it
was
not
his
game
to
show
his
feelings
he
went
about
laughing
as
though
nothing
had
happened
at
all
he
treated
the
whole
thing
as
a
colossal
joke
sydenham
was
however
very
nervous
and
showed
it
gordon
ragged
him
mercilessly
my
good
man
what
the
hell
does
it
matter
chief
not
much
of
a
bircher
and
do
gas
about
disgrace
and
such
muck
this
is
a
st
winifred
sort
of
school
it
will
only
mean
a
bad
report
in
school
that
day
gordon
was
in
great
form
by
the
end
of
the
morning
he
had
accumulated
in
all
three
hundred
lines
from
various
sources
for
ragging
that
man
caruthers
is
some
fellow
said
ferguson
to
simonds
at
lunch
he
looks
as
if
he
enjoyed
being
in
rows
perhaps
he
does
was
the
answer
he
is
certainly
always
doing
his
best
to
get
into
them
but
he
is
in
for
a
birching
this
time
but
simonds
was
wrong
the
chief
was
too
utterly
fed
up
to
do
anything
moreover
he
saw
that
a
birching
would
do
gordon
no
good
he
would
only
boast
about
it
it
was
not
until
a
week
later
that
gordon
was
called
up
before
the
chief
caruthers
i
want
to
know
where
you
got
hold
of
that
crib
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
obtained
it
by
means
of
rudd
who
had
a
large
stock
of
such
articles
and
let
them
out
on
loan
for
the
term
it
was
a
paying
business
gordon
of
course
could
not
divulge
this
i
got
it
in
the
holidays
sir
the
chief
was
surprised
and
shocked
at
this
he
could
quite
easily
understood
that
a
boy
should
buy
a
crib
at
some
bookshop
in
the
town
during
term
time
when
surrounded
with
the
general
atmosphere
of
public
school
dishonesty
but
it
did
seem
unnatural
that
a
boy
while
living
in
the
clean
surroundings
of
his
home
should
be
scheming
to
cheat
his
fellows
and
masters
the
chief
said
as
much
gordon
did
not
quite
follow
him
besides
everyone
cribbed
what
i
ca
understand
caruthers
the
chief
went
on
is
that
you
always
assume
a
tremendous
keenness
on
the
school
and
house
of
which
you
give
absolutely
no
proof
in
your
actions
except
on
the
field
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
do
you
imagine
that
the
good
reputation
of
the
house
depends
solely
on
its
performance
in
the
thirds
or
that
of
the
school
on
its
number
of
victories
in
school
matches
gordon
thought
it
did
but
he
knew
that
yes
was
hardly
the
answer
the
chief
expected
he
held
his
peace
it
was
no
use
arguing
the
subject
when
he
came
out
of
the
study
he
met
rudd
palpitating
with
funk
you
did
say
anything
about
my
lending
you
that
crib
did
you
rudd
was
very
frightened
of
the
chief
of
course
not
you
fool
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
and
get
me
a
better
crib
with
all
possible
speed
my
friend
and
mind
it
a
decent
one
the
last
one
was
rotten
and
i
ca
do
without
one
i
was
bottled
yesterday
in
three
days
rudd
agent
from
town
had
procured
him
a
fine
edition
of
the
sicilian
expedition
davenport
and
gordon
did
some
superb
construe
during
the
remainder
of
the
term
it
is
of
course
very
easy
to
run
down
any
existing
system
and
the
public
school
system
has
come
in
for
its
fair
share
of
abuse
yet
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
one
has
yet
been
able
to
devise
a
better
and
after
all
for
the
average
man
it
is
not
such
a
bad
training
it
is
inclined
to
destroy
individuality
to
turn
out
a
fixed
pattern
it
wishes
to
take
everyone
no
matter
what
his
tastes
or
ideas
may
be
and
make
him
conform
to
its
own
ideals
in
the
process
much
good
is
destroyed
for
the
public
school
man
is
slack
tolerant
is
not
easily
upset
by
scruples
laughs
at
good
things
smiles
at
bad
yet
he
is
a
fine
follower
he
has
learnt
to
do
what
he
is
told
he
takes
life
as
he
sees
it
and
is
content
so
far
so
good
with
the
average
individual
the
system
is
not
so
very
unsatisfactory
but
take
the
case
of
the
boy
who
has
it
in
him
to
be
a
leader
who
is
not
merely
content
to
follow
but
wishes
to
be
at
the
head
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
what
of
him
gordon
went
to
fernhurst
with
the
determination
to
excel
and
at
once
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
success
lay
in
a
blind
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
god
of
athleticism
honesty
virtue
moral
determination
these
mattered
not
at
all
the
author
of
and
such
others
who
have
never
faced
really
faced
life
and
seen
what
it
is
talk
of
the
incalculable
good
one
boy
can
do
who
refuses
to
be
led
astray
by
temptations
and
remains
true
to
the
ideals
he
learnt
in
the
nursery
if
there
does
come
into
any
school
such
a
boy
he
is
merely
labelled
as
pi
and
taken
no
notice
of
he
who
wishes
to
get
to
the
front
has
to
strive
after
success
on
the
field
and
success
on
the
field
alone
this
is
the
way
that
the
future
leaders
of
england
are
being
trained
to
take
their
proper
place
in
the
national
struggle
for
a
right
and
civilisation
on
this
alone
the
system
stands
condemned
for
the
history
of
a
nation
is
the
history
of
its
great
men
and
the
one
object
of
the
public
school
is
to
produce
not
great
men
but
a
satisfactory
type
gordon
found
that
as
soon
as
he
was
recognised
as
a
coming
athlete
popularity
was
his
and
that
on
the
strength
of
his
physical
abilities
he
could
do
pretty
well
what
he
liked
for
there
is
no
strong
feeling
in
schools
on
the
subject
of
honesty
and
morality
and
it
is
not
unnatural
that
a
boy
finding
that
no
one
will
object
if
he
follows
the
call
of
pleasure
drifts
with
the
stream
and
then
gordon
went
off
suddenly
at
games
as
the
best
athlete
must
at
some
time
or
other
like
many
others
he
loved
popularity
and
fame
so
in
order
to
keep
in
the
limelight
he
flung
aside
all
pretences
of
conscience
and
got
the
reputation
of
being
the
devil
of
a
sport
a
reputation
that
is
a
passport
to
public
school
society
but
is
damning
to
any
man
character
only
a
few
realise
this
betteridge
was
one
he
was
not
an
athlete
but
was
clever
and
in
the
sixth
he
enjoyed
a
rag
but
saw
the
difference
between
liberty
and
licence
he
was
a
freethinker
and
saw
life
with
a
wide
vision
that
embraced
the
whole
horizon
look
here
caruthers
he
said
one
evening
during
hall
in
the
last
half
of
the
summer
term
i
do
want
to
say
anything
but
you
know
you
are
making
a
most
awful
ass
of
yourself
what
do
you
mean
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
i
do
think
it
your
fault
it
is
the
fault
of
this
rotten
system
under
which
we
live
you
are
not
what
you
were
when
you
first
came
of
course
it
is
natural
to
crib
and
fool
about
but
you
are
going
a
bit
far
one
day
you
will
be
captain
of
this
house
you
be
sorry
then
oh
do
be
a
damned
ass
betteridge
preaching
to
me
i
know
what
i
am
doing
it
not
long
that
i
shall
have
to
enjoy
myself
i
shall
be
in
the
sixth
soon
and
shall
have
to
slow
down
then
but
at
present
i
shall
do
damned
well
what
i
like
after
all
what
does
it
matter
if
i
do
rot
all
day
and
muck
about
generally
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
or
the
house
it
my
own
damned
business
and
besides
everyone
else
does
it
it
was
useless
to
reason
with
him
the
argument
that
others
do
it
is
impossible
to
combat
and
after
all
environment
is
what
counts
and
it
is
a
fairly
dangerous
environment
with
which
to
surround
any
but
the
average
sensual
being
who
eats
drinks
laughs
and
is
merry
and
never
thinks
at
all
and
yet
masters
are
surprised
when
they
find
the
big
man
whom
they
thought
impregnable
following
the
accepted
customs
they
say
what
a
pity
a
fine
fellow
gone
to
the
dogs
and
after
all
we
done
for
him
too
and
yet
whose
fault
is
it
but
this
is
by
the
wayside
for
better
or
for
worse
the
character
of
gordon
caruthers
was
developing
on
its
own
lines
criticism
should
be
withheld
till
the
last
threads
are
woven
and
we
can
judge
of
the
complex
whole
the
summer
term
was
drawing
to
a
close
it
had
not
been
very
successful
as
far
as
gordon
was
concerned
his
cricket
had
frankly
been
a
failure
and
the
prominence
he
had
gained
in
his
house
hardly
compensated
for
the
misgivings
with
which
the
chief
and
buller
regarded
his
future
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
help
running
up
against
the
bull
was
knocked
out
of
the
senior
house
competition
at
once
they
drew
christy
and
were
beaten
by
an
innings
gordon
made
eleven
and
fifteen
and
was
missed
three
times
while
making
them
foster
however
got
a
very
sturdy
not
out
and
took
three
wickets
he
got
his
house
cap
gordon
was
furious
and
swore
that
he
was
jolly
well
not
going
to
try
any
more
that
term
during
the
final
senior
he
was
strolling
round
the
field
with
tester
both
of
them
in
cloth
suits
unchanged
for
games
the
bull
came
up
behind
them
caruthers
why
are
you
changed
this
afternoon
well
sir
we
only
had
a
house
game
this
afternoon
so
tester
and
i
got
leave
off
to
watch
the
match
but
your
house
is
not
playing
in
it
no
sir
well
then
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
by
slacking
about
the
field
like
this
it
your
duty
to
be
training
yourself
too
so
that
some
day
you
may
be
of
some
use
to
fernhurst
and
here
are
you
slacking
about
instead
of
asking
the
pro
to
give
you
a
net
slackness
filthy
slackness
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
you
this
term
you
were
quite
keen
once
he
strolled
off
scratching
the
back
of
his
head
the
bull
always
did
this
when
in
a
bad
temper
poor
old
chap
murmured
tester
he
takes
these
little
things
so
much
to
heart
he
loathes
me
because
i
do
sweat
myself
to
death
all
day
at
the
nets
he
never
said
anything
to
me
he
has
given
me
up
as
a
bad
job
poor
old
chap
well
i
suppose
we
ought
to
have
been
at
the
nets
said
gordon
if
we
did
everything
that
we
ought
to
do
in
this
world
we
should
never
have
a
moment
time
to
do
the
things
we
liked
i
suppose
so
said
gordon
but
still
you
know
oh
well
what
the
hell
does
it
matter
by
jove
well
hit
dyke
the
conversation
turned
again
to
the
match
next
term
gordon
had
arranged
to
have
a
study
with
lovelace
tester
was
going
to
be
a
prefect
and
wanted
to
himself
the
big
upstairs
study
that
clarke
had
had
gordon
was
staying
in
no
he
was
not
sorry
he
did
not
quite
understand
tester
he
was
too
clever
and
gordon
never
knew
exactly
what
he
was
driving
at
lovelace
on
the
other
hand
was
his
best
friend
they
had
played
together
in
several
sides
and
next
term
lovelace
would
captain
the
footer
colts
the
future
seemed
very
roseate
moreover
he
was
certain
to
get
into
the
sixth
and
that
meant
many
privileges
he
did
not
have
to
attend
rolls
he
could
be
late
for
tea
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
get
leave
to
speak
to
anyone
in
hall
it
meant
many
study
hours
and
it
would
also
bring
him
into
contact
with
the
olympians
there
was
garter
who
had
been
in
the
sixth
four
terms
and
was
in
the
second
fifteen
he
would
meet
betteridge
there
was
rudd
to
rag
prothero
had
reduced
his
to
one
hour
in
school
a
day
and
was
an
authority
to
consult
on
any
subject
regarding
avoiding
work
davenport
would
be
promoted
too
gordon
day
of
power
was
beginning
to
dawn
next
term
he
would
be
distinctly
a
house
blood
it
was
a
ravishing
thought
one
evening
in
exam
week
hunter
announced
casually
after
tea
i
say
do
you
remember
betteridge
talking
once
about
a
man
called
ferrers
well
he
is
coming
here
as
a
master
next
term
oh
lord
is
he
really
said
fletcher
i
suppose
he
will
be
full
of
rotten
new
theories
and
he
will
probably
want
to
make
us
work
well
i
always
give
a
master
a
good
fortnight
trial
before
i
do
any
work
for
him
said
tester
at
the
end
of
that
i
usually
find
his
keenness
has
worn
off
i
bet
he
will
be
the
same
as
all
the
rest
i
doubt
it
said
betteridge
he
is
a
man
well
whatever
he
is
he
is
going
to
have
no
effect
on
me
said
gordon
with
a
finality
that
quite
closed
the
question
chapter
iv
through
a
glass
darkly
as
often
as
not
it
is
mere
chance
that
provides
the
most
essentially
important
moments
in
our
lives
it
is
easy
to
talk
of
the
inevitable
march
of
fate
but
more
usually
a
chance
word
or
look
alters
our
entire
outlook
on
life
and
so
it
was
that
the
course
of
gordon
whole
career
was
suddenly
changed
into
a
different
channel
at
a
moment
when
he
was
drifting
placidly
on
the
stream
of
a
lax
conventionality
and
was
frittering
away
all
his
opportunities
for
sheer
lack
of
anything
that
would
spur
him
on
to
a
clearer
conception
of
what
life
means
during
the
whole
of
the
term
tester
and
gordon
had
done
their
early
morning
preparation
on
the
a
green
as
they
had
answered
their
names
at
roll
they
would
take
out
and
cushions
and
luxuriously
pass
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
breakfast
reclining
back
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
evening
work
it
is
a
very
beautiful
spot
the
a
green
on
three
sides
it
is
flanked
with
buildings
on
the
fourth
is
a
low
wall
which
is
used
as
an
exit
for
nocturnal
expeditions
it
was
under
the
a
that
gordon
and
tester
put
their
chairs
opposite
them
was
the
grey
library
beyond
rose
the
abbey
solemn
and
austere
on
the
left
was
the
chapel
and
the
long
cloister
leading
to
big
school
in
the
early
morning
a
great
hush
pervaded
the
place
the
only
sound
was
the
faint
tolling
of
the
almshouse
bell
between
the
abbey
and
the
library
the
sun
rose
in
a
blaze
of
glory
on
the
last
morning
of
the
term
gordon
and
tester
lolled
back
in
their
comfortable
chairs
gordon
was
trying
to
learn
his
for
the
exam
that
morning
tester
was
reading
oxford
book
of
english
the
exams
for
the
sixth
were
over
oh
damn
this
said
gordon
i
ca
learn
the
stuff
he
flung
the
book
down
and
lay
back
watching
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
flicker
on
the
cold
bronze
of
the
abbey
this
has
been
a
rotten
term
you
know
he
said
at
last
yes
said
tester
he
was
engrossed
in
poetry
well
i
got
into
the
deuce
of
a
row
with
chief
and
i
never
got
my
house
cap
and
i
broken
it
off
with
jackson
tester
put
down
his
book
and
sat
up
caruthers
you
know
you
are
wasting
your
time
here
are
you
with
all
your
brilliance
and
your
personality
worrying
only
about
house
caps
and
petty
intrigues
and
little
things
like
that
what
you
want
to
realise
is
that
there
is
something
beyond
the
aim
of
a
fernhurst
career
you
are
clever
enough
but
poetry
and
art
mean
nothing
to
you
oh
poetry
that
all
right
for
claremont
and
asses
like
that
but
what
the
use
of
it
oh
use
use
nothing
but
this
eternal
cry
about
the
use
of
a
thing
poetry
is
the
sort
of
of
man
what
wrong
with
you
is
that
you
read
the
wrong
stuff
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
to
worship
wordsworth
and
calm
philosophy
but
youth
wants
colour
life
passion
the
poetry
of
revolt
now
look
here
let
me
read
you
this
and
then
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
oh
all
right
is
it
long
no
not
very
in
a
low
clear
voice
tester
began
to
read
the
great
spring
chorus
in
into
which
swinburne
has
crowded
all
that
he
ever
knew
of
joy
and
happiness
in
everyone
there
lies
the
love
of
beauty
we
needs
must
love
the
highest
when
we
see
it
but
the
pity
is
that
so
few
of
us
are
ever
brought
face
to
face
with
the
really
lovely
or
perhaps
if
we
are
we
come
to
it
too
late
our
power
of
appreciation
has
lain
too
long
dormant
ever
to
be
aroused
and
at
school
it
is
the
common
thing
for
boys
to
pass
through
their
six
years
traffic
without
ever
realising
what
beauty
is
they
are
told
to
read
vergil
tennyson
and
browning
the
philosophers
the
comforters
of
old
age
poets
who
had
for
weary
feet
the
gift
of
rest
but
boys
never
hear
of
byron
swinburne
and
rossetti
men
with
big
flaming
hearts
that
cried
for
physical
beauty
and
the
loveliness
of
tangible
things
as
a
result
they
drift
out
into
the
world
to
take
their
place
with
the
dull
commonplace
philistine
who
has
made
the
house
of
commons
what
it
is
but
as
gordon
heard
tester
reading
the
wonderful
riot
of
melody
which
conjures
up
visions
of
rainbows
and
sunsets
of
dew
gleaming
like
crystals
in
the
morning
of
water
gliding
like
forgotten
songs
a
strange
peace
descended
on
him
he
had
not
known
that
there
could
be
anything
so
intensely
beautiful
over
the
great
abbey
the
sun
was
rising
heavenwards
down
the
street
past
the
almshouses
he
heard
the
happy
sound
of
a
young
girl
laughing
the
world
was
full
of
strange
new
things
there
was
a
new
meaning
in
the
song
of
the
blackbird
in
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
in
the
whispering
of
the
warm
wind
and
suddenly
there
came
over
him
a
sensation
of
how
far
he
himself
was
below
the
splendour
of
it
all
he
had
walked
through
life
with
blinded
eyes
with
dulled
senses
he
had
stared
at
the
ground
while
all
the
time
the
great
ideal
of
beauty
was
shining
from
the
blue
mountains
of
man
desire
tester
had
finished
reading
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
oh
it
wonderful
i
never
dreamt
of
such
music
yes
you
see
masters
grow
old
they
forget
what
it
was
like
to
be
young
they
want
us
to
look
at
life
through
their
spectacles
and
of
course
we
ca
youth
and
age
is
an
impossible
combination
we
have
to
cut
a
way
for
ourselves
caruthers
sometimes
we
fail
sometimes
we
succeed
i
made
a
pretty
fair
mess
of
things
because
i
have
gone
on
my
own
way
because
i
have
had
no
one
to
guide
me
i
found
little
consolation
in
mature
thought
and
i
am
not
one
of
the
fools
who
has
just
taken
things
for
granted
i
strike
out
by
myself
i
want
to
find
what
beauty
really
is
and
i
shall
find
it
by
sifting
out
everything
first
i
have
probed
a
good
many
things
one
way
and
another
some
ugly
some
beautiful
i
have
followed
the
course
of
nature
after
all
nature
is
more
likely
to
be
right
than
an
artificial
civilisation
i
follow
where
my
inclinations
lead
me
i
hate
laws
and
regulations
as
often
said
i
did
not
ask
to
come
into
this
world
so
i
shall
do
as
i
please
and
i
think
that
i
shall
reach
home
all
right
in
the
end
literature
is
a
great
yes
said
gordon
simply
i
never
imagined
it
before
who
wrote
that
by
the
way
swinburne
the
great
pagan
who
was
sick
of
the
sham
and
pretence
of
his
day
and
cried
for
the
glories
of
rome
look
here
caruthers
come
down
to
gisson
afterwards
and
as
a
memento
of
our
year
together
in
study
just
let
me
give
you
swinburne
and
it
great
stuff
you
like
it
and
you
find
there
something
a
bit
better
than
your
caps
and
pots
gordon
did
not
answer
the
sun
had
now
risen
high
above
the
abbey
across
the
silence
was
wafted
the
cracked
notes
of
the
school
house
bell
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
from
the
studies
for
a
few
minutes
gordon
lay
back
in
his
chair
quite
quiet
a
new
day
had
broken
on
his
life
the
future
opened
out
with
wide
promises
with
possibilities
of
great
things
for
he
had
heard
at
last
the
call
which
if
ever
a
man
hears
it
he
casts
away
the
nets
and
follows
after
the
call
of
beauty
which
is
after
all
only
truth
seen
from
another
side
book

unravelling
the
threads
and

would
you
tread

the
old

good

man
very
rarely
changes
what
he
is
at
the
beginning
he
is
at
the

all
that
occurs
is
that
at
various
stages
of
his
journey
he
looks
at
life
from
a
different
point
of
view
or
rather
through
a
different
pair
of
spectacles
for
never
on
this
earth
do
we
really
see
things
as
they
are
when
gordon
found
new
influences
at
work
upon
him
when
he
discovered
through
literature
that
there
is
something
higher
than
the
ignoble
monotony
of
the
average
individual
routine
he
did
not
suddenly
change
his
whole
way
of
life
and
like
a
swimmer
into
cleanness
leaping
put
out
of
sight
behind
him
the
things
that
had
pleased
him
once
right
and
wrong
are
merely
relative
terms
what
was
considered
right
in
the
days
of
cæsar
spells
social
ostracism
and
there
are
a
few
who
prefer
to
see
life
as
the
romans
saw
it
and
to
follow
the
ideals
of
power
and
physical
beauty
for
such
life
is
not
easy
yet
we
are
not
so
much
better
than
when
cæsar
augustus
was
egypt
lord
the
question
of
what
is
really
right
and
what
is
really
wrong
will
never
be
satisfactorily
decided
on
this
earth
at
any
rate
for
we
can
not
all
wear
the
same
spectacles
for
long
temperament
is
and
gordon
made
no
attempt
to
settle
the
question
he
did
not
suddenly
feel
a
loathing
for
his
former
pleasures
but
during
the
long
summer
holidays
as
he
bathed
in
the
waters
of
english
poetry
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
outgrown
them
and
cast
them
aside
perhaps
in
the
future
they
might
momentarily
appear
beautiful
once
more
but
he
did
not
think
that
he
would
ever
again
wear
them
for
very
long
for
they
were
after
all
little
insignificant
trivial
and
contrasted
poorly
with
the
white
heat
of
byron
passion
and
the
flaming
ardour
of
swinburne
that
cried
for
the
old
kingdoms
of
earth
and
their
kings
as
he
read
on
while
the
summer
sun
sank
in
a
red
sea
behind
the
gaunt
hampstead
firs
read
of
the
proud
domineering
soul
of
manfred
visualised
the
burst
of
passion
that
had
prompted
the
murder
in
last
felt
the
thundering
paganism
of
the
to
he
was
overcome
with
a
tremendous
hatred
for
the
system
that
had
kept
literature
from
him
as
a
shut
book
that
had
offered
him
mature
philosophy
instead
of
colour
and
youth
and
tried
to
prevent
him
from
seeking
it
for
himself
so
this
is
the
way
he
thought
the
youth
of
england
is
being
brought
up
masters
tell
us
to
fix
all
our
energies
on
achieving
school
successes
and
think
of
prizes
and
tasselled
caps
all
day
long
no
wonder
that
if
they
bind
us
down
to
trivial
things
we
become
like
the
man
with
the
and
drift
on
with
low
aims
with
nothing
to
help
us
to
live
differently
from
cattle
no
wonder
the
whole
common
room
is
repeatedly
shocked
by
the
discovery
of
some
sordid
scandal
gordon
soul
was
very
arrogant
and
very
intolerant
and
it
was
rather
unfortunate
that
at
a
time
when
he
was
bubbling
over
with
rebellion
arnold
lunn
novel
should
have
been
published
as
no
previous
school
story
had
done
it
stripped
school
life
of
sentiment
and
a
storm
of
adverse
criticism
broke
out
old
harrovians
wrote
to
the
papers
saying
that
they
had
been
at
harrow
for
six
years
and
that
the
conversation
was
except
in
a
few
ignoble
exceptions
pure
and
manly
and
that
the
general
atmosphere
was
one
of
clean
healthy
broadmindedness
gordon
fumed
what
fools
all
these
people
were
when
they
were
told
the
truth
they
would
not
believe
it
prophets
must
prophesy
smooth
things
or
else
were
not
prophets
how
was
there
ever
going
to
be
any
hope
of
improvement
till
the
true
state
of
affairs
was
understood
and
then
a
sudden
doubt
came
to
gordon
what
if
these
old
harrovians
were
right
what
if
this
man
lunn
had
depicted
the
life
of
the
exceptional
not
of
the
average
boy
what
then
of
fernhurst
he
had
judged
the
book
by
his
own
experiences
was
it
possible
that
his
school
was
worse
than
other
schools
and
what
was
usual
there
would
be
exceptional
at
rugby
eton
and
winchester
he
had
been
so
proud
of
fernhurst
with
its
grey
cloisters
and
dreaming
abbey
with
its
magnificent
fifteen
and
fine
boxers
he
had
cursed
at
the
public
school
system
because
he
thought
it
had
done
harm
to
fernhurst
what
if
fernhurst
and
not
the
system
were
at
fault
for
several
days
this
worried
him
one
evening
however
during
the
last
week
of
the
holidays
a
mr
ainslie
came
to
dinner
he
had
been
a
contemporary
of
lunn
at
harrow
and
had
himself
been
head
of
his
house
for
two
years
the
conversation
had
drifted
to
a
discussion
of
recent
books
woman
thou
gavest
devil
the
by
the
way
gordon
said
ainslie
read
that
book
oh
yes
sir
what
did
you
think
of
it
i
liked
it
very
much
thought
it
was
the
finest
school
story
i
had
ever
read
gordon
felt
rather
nervous
he
was
aware
that
he
was
on
thin
ice
and
timidly
blurted
out
but
sir
was
it
true
to
harrow
life
absolutely
and
it
as
true
to
the
life
of
any
other
public
school
they
are
all
much
the
same
you
know
at
the
root
an
immense
weight
was
lifted
from
gordon
mind
i
thought
so
sir
but
such
a
lot
of
fellows
wrote
to
the
papers
saying
it
was
all
rot
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
my
dear
gordon
do
you
make
any
mistake
about
it
lunn
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
but
old
public
school
men
shroud
their
school
life
in
a
mist
of
sentiment
so
they
forget
what
they
really
did
all
they
remember
is
how
they
ragged
the
master
and
pulled
off
the
senior
cricket
cup
why
when
that
new
house
master
oh
what
his
name
lee
well
at
any
rate
when
he
came
to
lunn
house
he
was
slowly
getting
rid
of
undesirables
for
terms
actually
for
terms
cayley
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
to
go
and
of
course
no
one
thought
of
anything
but
games
i
got
a
schol
there
from
my
and
i
literally
had
to
live
it
down
it
took
me
some
time
too
we
want
a
good
deal
of
improvement
in
this
rusty
old
system
so
after
all
it
was
the
system
that
was
at
fault
not
fernhurst
fairly
contentedly
he
went
back
by
the
from
waterloo
but
as
he
saw
the
evening
sun
steeping
the
gravel
courts
in
shadows
and
watched
the
lights
flickering
behind
the
study
panes
it
came
home
to
him
with
a
poignant
vividness
that
fernhurst
which
should
have
been
a
home
of
dreams
and
of
ideas
had
by
the
inefficiency
of
a
vacillating
system
become
immersed
in
petty
intrigues
and
was
filled
with
a
generation
that
was
being
taught
to
blind
itself
to
the
higher
issues
but
in
a
moment
he
was
caught
up
in
the
tear
and
bustle
of
an
opening
term
there
was
the
rush
to
the
to
see
what
dormitory
he
was
in
who
were
the
prefects
then
the
hurried
interview
with
the
chief
and
the
inevitable
health
certificate
the
meeting
of
the
from
exeter
prayers
the
arrival
of
the
last
train
and
finally
sleep
the
hold
of
tradition
is
very
strong
in
a
few
moments
gordon
had
flung
aside
his
doubts
and
scruples
with
collins
he
rolled
down
to
the
to
look
at
the
new
boys
there
were
twelve
of
them
in
all
very
frightened
very
timid
huddled
round
the
fire
wondering
what
was
before
them
well
caruthers
what
do
you
think
of
that
lot
said
collins
as
they
swaggered
back
again
to
the
studies
oh
not
much
that
fellow
second
from
the
left
was
not
bad
what
his
name
oh
yes
morcombe
believe
me
he
is
some
stuff
oh
i
thought
him
rather
a
specimen
but
i
say
that
fat
fellow
looks
rather
a
sport
you
know
the
man
like
a
dormouse
oh
yes
that
podgy
lad
morgan
he
is
welsh
i
know
about
him
he
was
captain
of
the
prep
last
year
at
football
not
a
bad
forward
i
believe
oh
but
there

bad
luck
this
year
the
defeat
at
by
worcester
and
kent
in
the
same
week
was
a
sore
point
with
gordon
oh
did
they
i
call
them
rotten
players
but
look
here
who
are
pres
oh
tester
betteridge
clarke
mansell
all
the
whole
crowd
good
god
pres
wait
a
sec
for
me
i
am
only
going
to
see
chief
for
a
second
i
am
going
to
get
confirmed
i
think
i
heard
you
get
off
some
work
for
it
half
a
sec
back
to
the
old
life
again
nothing
was
changed
the
same
talk
the
same
interests
all
the
old
things
the
same
only
he
was
altered
he
felt
as
if
he
wanted
to
stand
on
the
abbey
tower
and
shout
aloud
that
the
school
was
wasting
its
opportunities
and
was
struggling
blindly
in
the
dark
following
and
yet
for
all
that
he
would
not
have
lovelace
or
mansell
or
any
other
of
his
friends
the
least
bit
different
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
it
was
better
to
let
them
go
on
as
they
were
as
it
had
been
it
would
be
he
could
not
do
much
and
at
the
moment
he
decided
that
whatever
he
might
think
or
feel
he
would
outwardly
remain
the
same
the
world
was
not
going
to
look
at
his
soul
he
would
go
on
as
he
had
begun
putting
things
behind
him
as
he
outgrew
them
and
as
they
appeared
childish
to
him
only
a
very
few
should
ever
see
him
as
he
really
was
the
rest
would
not
understand
him
they
would
think
him
strange
unnatural
and
he
did
not
want
that
the
first
few
days
passed
quickly
the
entrance
of
ferrers
the
new
master
into
the
placid
fernhurst
atmosphere
caused
a
mild
sensation
the
school
first
saw
him
walking
across
the
courts
after
the
meeting
on
the
first
day
of
term
his
walk
was
a
roll
he
talked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
his
left
arm
sustained
a
pile
of
books
his
right
arm
gesticulated
wildly
good
gawd
said
tester
what
a
bounder
maybe
but
he
the
sort
of
man
to
wake
up
the
school
said
betteridge
is
it
rather
like
applying
a
to
a
man
who
is
only
fit
for
a
small
dose
of
eno
fruit
salt
and
in
the
bustle
of
a
new
term
ferrers
was
forgotten
gordon
was
in
the
sixth
and
its
privileges
were
indeed
sweet
he
felt
very
proud
as
he
sat
in
the
same
room
with
harding
a
and
head
of
the
house
and
with
hazelton
the
captain
of
the
house
though
it
was
an
ordeal
to
go
on
to
con
before
them
it
was
very
magnificent
to
roll
down
to
the
football
field
just
before
the
game
began
without
attending
roll
i
say
caruthers
lovelace
would
yell
across
the
do
buck
up
it
nearly
to
three
and
roll
is
at
a
quarter
to
i
do
go
to
roll
came
the
lordly
answer
and
he
felt
the
eyes
of
admiring
juniors
fixed
on
him
it
was
sheer
joy
too
to
wear
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
sixth
form
and
to
carry
a
to
stroll
into
shops
that
were
to
the
rest
of
the
school
out
of
bounds
to
go
to
the
armoury
and
the
gym
after
tea
without
a
pass
but
it
was
in
hall
that
the
new
position
meant
most
while
the
rest
of
the
house
had
to
stay
in
their
studies
and
make
some
pretence
of
work
he
would
wander
indolently
down
the
passage
and
pay
calls
when
he
paused
outside
a
study
he
heard
the
invariable
sound
of
a
novel
flying
into
the
basket
of
a
paper
being
shoved
under
the
table
or
a
cake
being
relegated
to
the
then
he
came
in
a
curse
always
greeted
him
oh
damn
you
caruthers
i
thought
it
was
a
prefect
foster
hoist
out
that
cake
we
were
just
having
a
meal
he
now
had
the
freedom
of
studies
that
had
before
been
to
him
as
holy
places
where
once
clarke
had
dealt
out
justice
with
a
heavy
hand
tester
and
he
sat
before
the
fire
discussing
books
and
life
in
the
games
study
where
once
he
trembled
before
the
rage
of
lovelace
major
he
sat
with
carter
in
hall
preparing
thucydides
steps
would
sound
down
the
passage
a
knock
on
the
door
come
in
bawled
carter
please
carter
may
i
speak
to
smith
a
nervous
voice
would
say
no
one
could
talk
without
leave
from
a
prefect
during
hall
yes
and
shut
the
outer
door
carter
answered
without
looking
round
the
prefectorial
dignity
seemed
in
a
way
to
descend
on
gordon
just
then
life
was
very
good
but
there
were
times
when
he
would
feel
an
uncontrollable
impatience
with
the
regime
under
which
he
lived
one
of
these
was
on
the
second
sunday
of
term
it
was
rogers
turn
to
preach
and
as
always
gordon
prepared
himself
for
a
twenty
minutes
sleep
till
the
outburst
of
egoistic
rhetoric
was
spent
but
this
time
about
through
a
few
phrases
floated
through
his
mist
of
dreams
and
caught
his
attention
rogers
was
talking
about
the
impending
confirmation
service
with
one
hand
on
the
lectern
and
the
other
brandishing
his
as
was
his
custom
when
he
intended
to
be
more
than
usually
impressive
he
began
the
really
vital
part
of
the
sermon
in
the
holidays
there
appeared
as
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
expect
some
of
you
saw
a
book
pretending
to
deal
with
life
at
one
of
our
largest
public
schools
i
say
pretending
because
the
book
contains
hardly
a
word
of
truth
the
writer
says
that
the
boys
are
callous
about
religious
questions
and
discuss
matters
which
only
people
should
mention
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
studies
and
still
more
serious
the
purport
of
the
book
was
to
attack
not
only
the
boys
but
even
the
masters
who
so
nobly
endeavour
to
inculcate
living
ideas
of
purity
and
christianity
i
am
only
too
well
aware
when
i
look
round
this
chapel
this
chapel
made
sacred
by
so
many
memories
that
nearly
every
word
of
that
accusation
is
false
yet
perhaps
there
are
times
in
our
mirth
shall
we
say
when
we
are
engaged
in
sport
or
genial
merriment
when
we
are
inclined
to
treat
sacred
matters
not
with
quite
that
reverence
that
we
ought
perhaps
rogers
prosed
on
epithet
followed
epithet
egotism
and
arrogance
vied
with
one
another
for
predominance
the
school
lolled
back
in
the
oak
seats
and
dreamt
of
house
matches
rags
impositions
impending
rows
at
last
the
chief
gave
out
the
final
hymn
into
the
cloisters
the
school
poured
out
hustling
shouting
a
stream
of
shadows
contentedly
rogers
went
back
to
his
house
ate
a
large
meal
and
addressed
a
little
homily
to
the
confirmation
candidates
in
his
house
on
the
virtues
of
sincerity
what
a
pitiable
state
of
mind
old
must
be
in
sighed
tester
when
the
scurry
of
feet
along
the
passage
had
died
down
kind
of
quiet
and
he
and
gordon
were
sitting
in
front
of
a
typically
huge
school
house
fire
i
do
think
i
should
call
it
a
mind
at
all
muttered
gordon
who
was
furious
about
the
whole
affair
the
man
an
utter
fool
when
he
is
told
the
truth
he
wo
believe
it
but
stands
there
in
the
pulpit
rambling
on
airing
his
rotten
opinions
good
god
and
that
the
sort
of
man
who
is
supposed
to
be
moulding
the
coming
generation
oh
sickening
well
my
good
boy
what
more
can
you
expect
the
really
brilliant
men
do
take
up
schoolmastering
it
is
the
worst
paid
profession
there
is
look
at
it
a
man
with
a
at
oxford
comes
down
to
a
place
like
fernhurst
and
sweats
his
guts
out
day
and
night
for
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
of
course
the
big
men
try
for
better
things
rogers
is
just
the
sort
of
fool
who
would
be
a
schoolmaster
he
has
got
no
brain
no
intellect
he
loves
jawing
and
nothing
could
be
more
suitable
for
him
than
the
third
form
the
pulpit
and
a
commission
in
the
but
perhaps
he
may
have
a
few
merits
i
have
not
found
any
yet
nor
i
but
you
know
some
good
men
take
up
schoolmastering
oh
of
course
they
do
there
is
the
chief
for
instance
a
brilliant
scholar
and
authority
on
coleridge
but
he
is
an
exception
and
besides
he
did
not
stop
an
assistant
master
long
he
got
a
headmastership
pretty
soon
chief
is
a
splendid
fellow
but
i
am
talking
of
the
average
man
just
look
at
our
staff
a
more
fatuous
set
of
fools
i
never
struck
all
in
a
groove
all
worshipping
the
same
rotten
tin
gods
i
am
always
repeating
myself
but
i
ca
help
it
damn
them
all
i
say
they
mucked
up
my
life
pretty
well
not
one
of
them
has
tried
to
help
me
they
sit
round
the
common
room
fire
and
gas
betteridge
swears
ferrers
is
a
wonderful
man
personally
i
think
he
is
an
unmitigated
nuisance
but
at
any
rate
he
is
the
only
man
who
ever
thinks
for
himself
oh
what
fools
they
all
are
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
gordon
and
tester
cursed
and
swore
at
everyone
and
everything
and
on
the
whole
felt
better
for
having
got
it
off
their
chests
at
any
rate
next
day
gordon
was
plotting
a
rag
on
an
enormous
scale
with
archie
fletcher
and
in
a
house
game
assisted
in
the
severe
routing
of
rogers
house
by
points
to
nil
it
takes
a
good
deal
to
upset
a
boy
of
fifteen
for
very
long
and
the
long
evenings
were
a
supreme
happiness
it
must
be
owned
that
during
hall
lovelace
was
rather
unsociable
it
was
not
that
he
studied
greek
or
latin
he
had
a
healthy
contempt
for
scholastic
triumphs
was
the
real
interest
of
his
life
this
is
my
work
he
used
to
scoff
brandishing
in
gordon
face
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
classic
scholar
and
i
discover
any
new
element
or
such
stuff
as
that
i
am
going
on
the
turf
this
is
my
work
for
an
hour
every
evening
he
laboured
perseveringly
at
his
work
with
form
books
and
huge
account
books
for
every
single
race
he
chose
the
runners
and
laid
imaginary
bets
each
night
he
made
out
how
much
he
had
lost
or
made
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
if
he
had
really
laid
money
on
the
horses
he
would
most
certainly
have
done
a
good
term
work
by
christmas
he
was
one
hundred
and
seventeen
pounds
up
this
pursuit
of
course
rather
militated
against
his
activities
in
the
but
as
he
said
it
was
only
claremont
the
old
methuselah
and
they
had
a
damned
good
crib
lovelace
did
his
work
from
seven
to
eight
and
during
this
time
caruthers
who
seemed
to
be
in
the
happy
condition
of
never
having
any
work
to
do
at
all
wandered
round
the
studies
and
during
his
peregrinations
many
who
had
been
to
him
before
merely
units
in
a
vast
organisation
detached
themselves
from
the
rest
and
became
to
him
living
characters
especially
was
this
so
with
foster
he
had
played
with
foster
for
two
years
in
the
colts
and
in
sides
but
there
had
never
been
anything
in
common
between
them
their
interests
had
been
far
apart
neither
stood
for
anything
to
the
other
but
now
when
gordon
found
himself
frequently
dropping
into
study
for
or
so
he
realised
how
many
qualities
foster
had
foster
was
obstinate
almost
quite
regardless
of
tradition
in
his
own
way
slightly
a
rebel
and
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
deceiving
masters
there
are
two
ways
of
making
a
master
look
a
fool
one
is
by
introducing
processions
and
coloured
mice
the
other
by
bowing
before
him
making
him
think
you
are
and
industrious
and
all
the
while
laughing
at
him
behind
his
back
gordon
preferred
the
former
because
he
had
the
love
of
battle
but
foster
held
to
the
second
method
in
its
way
equally
effective
and
anyone
who
shook
a
spear
against
authority
was
sure
of
sympathy
from
gordon
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
foster
bamboozle
claremont
with
the
greatest
regularity
foster
was
ploughed
in
his
failed
to
score
in
latin
prose
and
knew
nothing
of
his
and
yet
he
never
got
an
imposition
he
would
point
out
how
hard
he
worked
he
often
stayed
behind
after
school
for
a
few
seconds
to
ask
claremont
a
point
in
the
unseen
such
keenness
was
unusual
and
claremont
could
not
connect
it
with
the
slovenly
productions
that
he
had
learnt
to
associate
with
the
name
of
foster
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
vast
enigma
at
half
term
foster
report
consisted
of
one
word
typically
claremontian
inscrutable
but
manners
always
win
in
the
end
foster
showed
so
much
zeal
such
an
honest
willingness
to
learn
that
claremont
finally
classed
him
as
a
keen
friendly
but
amazingly
stupid
boy
the
army
class
which
foster
honoured
with
his
presence
always
did
latin
and
english
with
claremont
and
for
over
two
years
foster
sat
at
the
back
of
claremont
room
scoring
marks
by
singles
when
others
scored
by
tens
yet
his
reports
were
invariably
good
he
never
had
an
imposition
he
never
needed
to
prepare
a
line
of
anything
well
foster
claremont
used
to
say
as
he
returned
a
prose
entirely
besmirched
with
blue
pencil
i
believe
you
really
try
but
the
result
is
most
disheartening
foster
always
looked
profoundly
distressed
and
at
the
end
of
the
hour
he
would
go
up
prose
in
hand
and
ask
why
the
subject
of
an
active
verb
could
not
be
in
the
ablative
two
minutes
later
he
would
emerge
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
and
murmur
to
whoever
might
be
near
that
claremont
was
a
most
damnable
ass
but
none
the
less
a
pleasant
creature
and
in
the
evening
hall
he
and
gordon
would
discuss
how
one
or
other
of
them
had
advanced
a
step
further
into
the
enemy
country
and
taken
one
more
pawn
in
the
gigantic
game
of
bluff
they
were
both
in
their
own
fashion
working
to
the
same
end
but
at
this
point
the
serene
calm
of
gordon
life
was
suddenly
rudely
interrupted
by
an
incursion
on
the
part
of
the
bull
about
three
weeks
after
the
term
had
begun
the
colts
played
their
first
game
and
like
most
sides
at
the
beginning
of
a
season
they
were
terribly
disorganised
lovelace
who
had
been
in
teams
for
years
was
the
senior
colts
badge
and
was
captain
burgoyne
led
the
scrum
he
was
a
rough
diamond
if
indeed
a
diamond
at
all
and
was
not
too
popular
with
the
side
foster
was
scrum
half
collins
and
gordon
were
in
the
scrum
it
was
really
quite
a
decent
side
but
this
particular
afternoon
it
started
shakily
the
bull
raged
so
madly
and
cursed
so
furiously
that
the
side
became
petrified
with
funk
and
could
do
nothing
right
once
and
only
once
did
the
colts
look
like
scoring
and
then
lovelace
knocked
on
the
easiest
pass
right
between
the
posts
never
did
i
see
anything
like
it
bellowed
buller
for
eighteen
years
i
have
coached
fernhurst
and
before
that
i
coached
oxford
and
gloucestershire
and
i
am
not
going
to
stand
this
lovelace
you
are
not
fit
to
be
captain
of
a
let
alone
a
school
colts
side
burgoyne
skipper
the
side
now
then
two
minutes
more
to
do
something
colts
the
colts
did
do
something
they
let
the
other
side
score
twice
at
buller
poured
forth
a
superb
torrent
of
rhetoric
and
suddenly
there
came
over
gordon
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
laugh
the
bull
looked
so
funny
with
his
hair
ruffled
and
his
eyes
flaming
with
wrath
gordon
had
to
look
the
other
way
or
he
would
have
burst
into
paroxysms
of
laughter
when
one
is
overexcited
and
worried
hysteria
is
not
far
absent
gordon
turned
away
then
suddenly
he
felt
a
terrific
assault
on
his
backside
someone
had
booted
him
most
fiercely
and
turning
round
he
saw
the
face
of
buller
still
more
distorted
with
rage
never
saw
such
rudeness
here
am
i
trying
to
coach
the
rottenest
side
that
has
ever
disgraced
a
fernhurst
ground
and
you
have
the
manners
to
listen
to
me
good
man
are
you
so
perfect
that
you
can
afford
to
pay
no
attention
to
me
for
heaven
sake
do
make
your
footer
like
your
cricket
the
slackest
thing
in
the
whole
of
fernhurst
come
on
we
go
on
with
this
game
for
ten
more
minutes
the
bull
watched
the
colts
making
feverish
endeavours
to
do
anything
right
but
his
powers
of
endurance
were
not
equal
to
the
strain
here
he
shouted
as
harding
was
going
up
to
change
after
superintending
a
you
might
referee
for
about
ten
more
minutes
here
will
you
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
the
little
slackers
any
longer
a
sigh
of
relief
went
up
as
the
figure
of
buller
rolled
out
through
the
field
gate
strangely
enough
the
colts
did
rather
better
after
this
and
collins
scored
a
really
quite
fine
try
but
the
side
left
the
field
glowing
with
resentment
none
more
than
gordon
and
lovelace
what
does
the
fool
mean
by
making
a
little
ass
like
burgoyne
captain
complained
gordon
dirty
little
beast
who
does
not
wash
or
shave
and
he
hacked
me
up
the
bottom
too
the
swine
i
getting
a
bit
sick
of
bull
so
am
i
what
we
really
want
is
my
brother
back
again
he
kept
him
in
order
all
right
my
brother
was
a
strong
man
and
did
not
stand
any
rot
from
buller
or
anyone
else
hullo
you
two
you
look
about
fed
up
what
the
row
they
turned
round
mansell
was
coming
up
behind
them
lovelace
burst
out
perfervidly
it
that
fool
buller
he
cursed
the
colts
all
round
and
he
made
burgoyne
captain
instead
of
me
and
he
hacked
gordon
bottom
and
told
him
he
had
no
manners
believe
me
we
have
had
a
jolly
afternoon
and
i
suppose
he
said
that
he
had
captained
oxford
cambridge
new
zealand
and
the
fiji
islands
and
that
in
his
whole
career
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
oh
yes
he
fairly
rolled
out
his
qualifications
like
a
applying
for
a
post
oh
well
never
mind
said
mansell
he
is
a
good
chap
really
only
he
ca
keep
his
temper
he
probably
apologise
to
you
both
before
the
end
of
the
day
i
remember
ferguson
said
once
men
are
fools
and
half
of
them
are
bloody
fools
not
so
bad
for
ferguson
that
cheer
up
yes
but
damn
it
all
it
is
a
bit
thick
said
lovelace
and
a
tick
like
burgoyne
to
boot
as
they
were
changing
a
fag
from
buller
made
a
nervous
entry
he
looked
very
lost
but
finally
summoned
up
enough
courage
to
ask
davenport
if
he
knew
where
caruthers
was
yonder
sirrah
lurking
behind
the
piano
the
fag
came
up
oh
i
say
er
caruthers
bull
er
i
mean
mr
buller
wants
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
are
changed
right
said
gordon
i
said
so
said
mansell
he
will
weep
over
you
and
shake
your
hand
like
a
brother
and
after
you
will
follow
lovelace
who
will
once
more
lead
the
lads
with
white
jerseys
and
red
dragons
to
victory
against
osborne
you
need
stop
you
know
he
informed
the
fag
who
was
giving
a
performance
by
gyrating
first
on
one
foot
then
on
another
that
means
i
shall
miss
my
tea
said
gordon
i
fear
so
answered
mansell
i
do
really
think
you
can
expect
bull
to
receive
you
with
crumpets
and
muffins
and
other
goodly
delights
of
course
is
sunday
you
might
manage
to
work
a
but
do
rely
on
it
come
and
tell
me
the
result
of
your
chat
you
will
find
me
in
my
study
do
knock
just
walk
in
you
are
always
welcome
as
gordon
walked
across
the
courts
to
buller
study
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
how
the
interview
would
end
the
bull
was
often
like
this
only
yesterday
foster
had
told
him
some
long
yarn
of
how
he
had
beaten
a
lad
in
christy
and
had
hit
his
hand
by
mistake
and
to
kick
a
person
was
after
all
a
far
more
undignified
method
of
assault
it
was
almost
actionable
quite
contentedly
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
went
in
he
was
not
however
welcomed
with
open
arms
the
bull
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
facing
the
fireplace
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
so
gordon
wondered
if
it
would
be
correct
to
take
a
chair
the
bull
broke
the
silence
well
caruthers
are
you
sorry
for
what
happened
this
afternoon
this
took
gordon
by
surprise
it
was
hardly
the
interview
he
had
been
led
to
expect
he
murmured
yes
sir
rather
indistinctly
are
you
though
because
if
you
are
going
to
come
in
here
and
say
you
are
sorry
when
you
are
not
simply
to
smooth
things
over
you
would
be
a
pretty
rotten
sort
of
fellow
yes
sir
gordon
had
recovered
his
and
was
ready
for
a
fight
well
this
is
the
way
i
look
at
things
i
am
here
to
coach
fernhurst
sides
it
is
my
life
work
i
love
fernhurst
and
i
have
devoted
all
my
energy
and
care
to
help
my
old
school
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
trying
you
and
lovelace
between
you
to
ruin
my
work
and
stand
in
my
light
both
of
you
as
individuals
are
well
worth
your
places
in
both
sides
football
and
cricket
as
individuals
i
say
and
you
think
you
are
indispensable
to
the
side
and
that
we
ca
do
without
you
you
can
afford
to
laugh
when
you
miss
catches
and
not
pay
attention
to
me
when
i
am
trying
to
give
you
the
benefits
of
my
experience
i
heard
every
word
will
you
kindly
wait
till
i
have
finished
fernhurst
has
done
very
well
in
the
past
without
you
and
lovelace
and
five
years
hence
it
will
have
to
do
without
you
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
interfere
with
the
present
you
hate
me
i
dare
say
from
all
i
hear
of
you
you
hate
my
house
and
you
stir
up
sedition
against
me
you
show
the
others
how
much
you
care
for
me
and
you
are
both
people
who
have
some
influence
in
your
house
and
wherever
you
are
for
that
matter
and
are
you
using
it
for
the
good
of
fernhurst
you
ruined
all
my
pleasure
in
the
cricket
colts
but
i
do
care
about
myself
all
i
care
for
is
fernhurst
why
did
i
stop
lovelace
being
captain
because
i
want
a
man
who
is
going
to
back
me
up
who
is
going
to
play
for
the
side
and
not
for
himself
and
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
drop
lovelace
he
plays
for
himself
he
gives
rotten
passes
he
upsets
combination
and
i
wo
have
him
on
my
side
gordon
could
stand
it
no
longer
sir
i
am
not
going
to
hold
a
brief
for
myself
but
you
have
not
treated
lovelace
fairly
last
year
on
a
trial
game
you
kicked
him
out
of
the
side
only
to
find
in
a
week
that
you
could
not
do
without
him
and
sir
on
a
trial
game
you
deposed
him
from
the
captaincy
do
you
mean
to
say
that
after
playing
rugby
football
for
years
i
do
know
what
i
am
talking
about
gordon
saw
he
had
said
too
much
and
i
am
not
talking
about
his
play
i
am
talking
about
his
general
attitude
now
did
you
two
rag
about
a
good
deal
at
the
nets
last
term
well
sir
it
was
hardly
ragging
sir
oh
hardly
ragging
there
must
be
no
ragging
if
we
are
going
to
turn
out
good
sides
we
must
be
in
dead
earnest
the
whole
time
you
imagine
you
are
loyal
to
fernhurst
my
old
sides
followed
me
implicitly
i
loved
them
and
they
loved
me
we
worked
together
for
fernhurst
now
are
you
doing
your
best
for
fernhurst
gordon
was
overwhelmed
he
wanted
to
tell
the
bull
how
mistaken
he
was
that
he
and
lovelace
did
not
hate
him
at
all
that
they
were
doing
their
best
but
that
their
sense
of
humour
was
at
times
too
strong
but
it
was
useless
the
bull
would
not
give
him
a
chance
and
he
had
learnt
from
mansell
and
tester
that
the
bull
could
only
see
one
point
of
view
at
a
time
and
yet
he
was
filled
with
an
immense
admiration
for
this
man
who
thought
only
of
fernhurst
who
had
worked
for
fernhurst
all
his
life
who
made
fernhurst
interests
the
standard
for
every
judgment
and
action
there
was
something
essentially
noble
in
so
unswerving
a
devotion
if
only
his
love
of
fernhurst
had
not
made
him
so
complete
an
egoist
well
what
is
it
to
be
caruthers
buller
went
on
are
you
going
to
work
with
me
or
against
me
when
you
first
came
you
were
keen
and
willing
you
are
still
keen
but
you
think
too
much
of
yourself
now
you
imagine
you
know
more
than
i
do
is
all
this
going
to
stop
are
we
going
to
work
together
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
arguing
sir
i
shall
do
my
best
to
well
i
hope
so
caruthers
it
is
not
for
my
own
sake
i
mind
you
see
that
do
you
it
is
fernhurst
that
matters
we
must
all
do
our
best
for
fernhurst
i
hope
we
have
any
more
trouble
you
will
be
a
power
in
the
school
some
day
we
must
work
together
for
fernhurst
yes
sir
gordon
walked
to
the
door
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
he
paused
for
a
second
then
turned
round
sir
caruthers
he
was
out
in
the
street
again
there
was
a
tremendous
noise
going
on
in
one
of
the
buller
studies
from
the
courts
came
sounds
of
barge
football
he
did
not
feel
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
and
discuss
everything
with
mansell
for
a
minute
or
so
slowly
he
wandered
round
the
shrubbery
past
the
big
school
past
the
new
buildings
into
the
abbey
courtyard
he
sat
down
on
a
seat
and
tried
to
think
a
girl
came
and
sat
beside
him
and
smiled
at
him
invitingly
he
took
no
notice
she
sat
there
a
minute
or
so
then
got
up
and
walked
off
stiffly
the
abbey
clock
boomed
out
the
quarter
to
six
in
a
minute
or
so
he
would
have
to
go
back
to
tea
he
was
worried
he
liked
the
bull
admired
him
intensely
and
yet
the
bull
thought
he
hated
him
thought
him
disloyal
why
could
not
buller
keep
his
temper
why
must
he
rush
to
conclusions
without
weighing
the
evidence
and
the
bull
was
such
a
splendid
man
he
was
one
of
the
very
few
masters
gordon
respected
in
the
least
he
wanted
the
bull
to
like
him
and
then
there
was
lovelace
why
could
the
bull
try
to
see
life
as
lovelace
saw
it
why
must
he
want
everyone
to
share
the
same
views
as
he
look
at
everything
through
the
same
spectacles
it
have
mattered
if
he
was
merely
an
insignificant
busybody
like
christy
he
was
such
a
splendid
fellow
such
a
man
it
was
all
such
a
pity
and
yet
he
realised
that
he
would
have
to
try
and
bend
his
will
to
that
of
buller
he
must
endeavour
to
work
side
by
side
with
him
it
would
not
do
to
have
fernhurst
split
up
into
two
camps
in
the
past
he
had
thought
he
was
doing
his
best
but
the
bull
wanted
absolute
subservience
and
what
the
bull
wanted
he
usually
got
lovelace
however
took
quite
a
different
view
he
was
mad
with
buller
damn
it
all
it
is
not
the
first
time
the
swine
has
done
the
dirty
on
me
look
at
the
way
he
kicked
me
out
of
the
side
last
year
i
know
that
what
i
told
him
and
he
owned
that
both
of
us
as
individuals
were
worth
our
places
but
that
we
upset
the
side
and
rotted
about
and
were
always
up
against
him
silly
ass
the
man
must
be
we
are
keen
enough
are
we
but
i
damned
well
do
see
why
we
should
treat
footer
and
cricket
like
a
chapel
service
we
can
laugh
in
form
if
anything
funny
happens
then
why
the
hell
should
we
laugh
on
the
field
and
my
god
caruthers
you
did
look
an
ass
when
you
missed
that
catch
lovelace
roared
with
laughter
at
the
thought
of
it
the
way
you
juggled
with
it
and
old
bull
tearing
his
hair
oh
it
was
damned
funny
but
you
see
bull
thinks
games
are
everything
and
damn
it
all
they
are
the
things
that
really
matter
we
each
may
have
our
own
private
interests
but
games
are
the
thing
only
personally
i
do
see
why
we
should
not
see
the
funny
side
of
them
to
bull
a
dropped
catch
is
an
everlasting
disgrace
oh
let
bull
go
to
blazes
i
am
sick
of
him
if
he
wants
to
kid
me
out
of
the
colts
he
can
and
i
go
and
enjoy
myself
on
house
games
but
look
here
there
is
a
stoics
debate
and
it
nearly
you
had
better
go
down
and
bag
two
seats
the
stoics
society
was
of
elastic
proportions
including
everyone
above
iv
a
for
a
life
subscription
of
sixpence
and
during
the
winter
term
it
held
meetings
every
other
week
in
the
school
house
the
actual
membership
was
over
a
hundred
but
rarely
more
than
fifty
attended
and
of
those
who
went
only
fifty
per
cent
paid
any
attention
to
the
proceedings
the
rest
looked
on
it
as
a
good
excuse
for
getting
off
work
three
quarters
of
the
society
were
from
the
school
house
and
these
arrived
with
deck
chairs
cushions
and
a
novel
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
christy
was
the
president
and
this
was
to
a
great
extent
the
reason
for
so
general
an
atmosphere
of
boredom
and
indifference
for
christy
was
the
typical
product
of
conventionality
and
pharisaism
he
was
so
thoroughly
contented
with
anything
he
superintended
that
he
refused
to
believe
any
improvement
was
possible
but
this
year
betteridge
was
honorary
secretary
and
had
tried
to
infuse
a
little
life
into
the
society
the
subject
for
the
first
debate
of
the
term
was
classical
and
modern
education
and
ferrers
was
going
to
speak
for
the
modern
side
ferrers
was
always
writing
to
the
papers
and
was
already
well
known
in
the
common
room
as
a
feverish
orator
a
good
deal
had
been
rumoured
about
him
and
the
school
were
rather
anxious
to
hear
him
there
was
quite
a
large
audience
at
about
twenty
past
seven
christy
came
in
and
everyone
stood
up
till
he
had
sat
down
burgess
was
to
open
the
debate
for
the
classics
and
christy
was
to
second
him
ferrers
and
pothering
the
head
of
claremont
were
for
the
moderns
the
debate
was
supposed
to
open
at
twenty
past
the
hour
but
ferrers
had
not
arrived
there
was
an
awkward
pause
at
last
christy
got
up
i
really
think
it
is
useless
to
wait
any
longer
for
mr
ferrers
we
will
proceed
the
motion
before
the
house
is
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
house
a
classical
education
is
more
efficacious
than
a
modern
one
i
will
call
on
mr
burgess
to
open
the
motion
there
was
a
little
clapping
as
burgess
got
up
with
a
customary
display
of
conceit
he
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
took
a
glance
at
his
notes
and
then
began
with
the
blasé
air
of
mercury
addressing
a
salvation
army
meeting
of
course
those
in
favour
of
modern
education
will
defend
themselves
on
the
grounds
of
general
utility
they
will
point
out
the
uselessness
of
greek
in
business
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
the
public
school
man
should
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
wish
to
succeed
in
business
he
should
aim
higher
he
should
follow
the
ideals
set
before
him
by
the
classics
nearly
all
the
poets
and
politicians
of
are
public
school
men
nearly
all
he
went
on
rolling
off
absurdly
dogmatic
statements
that
were
based
solely
on
ignorance
and
arrogance
he
was
of
the
rogers
school
of
oratory
he
believed
that
a
sufficient
amount
of
conceit
and
would
carry
anyone
through
about
through
his
speech
he
was
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
a
whirlwind
there
was
a
sound
of
feet
on
the
stone
passage
something
crashed
against
the
door
and
in
rolled
ferrers
in
a
most
untidy
blue
suit
a
soft
collar
an
immense
woollen
waistcoat
and
three
books
under
his
arm
these
he
slammed
on
the
table
in
company
with
his
cap
awfully
sorry
christy
old
fellow
been
kept
new
lot
of
books
from
methuen
had
to
take
one
up
to
my
wife
rather
ill
you
know
fire
away
burgess
all
his
remarks
were
flung
off
in
jerks
at
a
terrific
rate
the
abashed
orator
concluded
rather
prematurely
and
rather
wildly
such
an
incursion
was
most
irregular
and
very
perplexing
i
will
now
call
on
mr
ferrers
to
speak
up
leapt
ferrers
and
began
at
once
firing
off
his
speech
at
the
pace
of
a
cinematograph
he
was
full
of
mannerisms
he
would
clap
his
hand
over
his
eyes
when
he
wanted
to
think
of
something
and
would
then
spread
it
out
straight
before
him
it
was
rather
dangerous
to
get
close
he
would
pick
up
one
of
his
books
and
shake
it
in
the
face
of
christy
this
is
what
mackenzie
says
in
fine
book
smashes
up
everything
shows
the
shallowness
of
our
education
this
is
what
he
says
after
he
had
read
a
few
words
he
would
bang
the
book
down
on
the
table
and
continue
pouring
forth
inextricable
anacolutha
everyone
was
listening
they
had
never
heard
anything
like
this
before
it
was
a
revelation
christy
chewed
his
burgess
assumed
an
air
of
olympian
content
the
flood
of
rhetoric
rolled
on
it
is
like
this
you
see
the
classical
education
makes
you
imitate
all
the
time
greek
prose
like
sophocles
latin
verse
like
petronius
i
do
know
if
i
have
got
the
names
right
probably
not
never
could
stick
doing
it
there
is
no
free
thought
classics
men
do
very
well
in
the
foreign
offices
but
they
ca
think
what
do
classics
do
in
the
literary
world
nothing
bennett
lloyd
george
wells
the
best
men
never
went
to
a
public
school
we
want
originality
and
the
classics
do
give
it
they
are
all
right
for
a
year
or
so
to
give
a
grounding
of
taste
though
they
do
give
that
to
the
average
boy
but
no
more
what
did
i
learn
from
classics
only
to
devise
a
new
way
of
bringing
a
crib
into
form
is
that
an
education
no
we
want
french
jolly
few
cribs
to
be
got
of
daudet
that
are
any
use
to
the
lower
fifth
maths
that
the
stuff
makes
them
think
riders
get
them
out
your
own
way
not
vergil
way
or
socrates
way
your
own
way
originality
in
this
strain
he
talked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
held
the
audience
spellbound
he
had
really
interested
them
here
was
something
new
something
worth
listening
to
he
was
received
with
a
roar
of
clapping
after
his
speech
everything
else
fell
flat
christy
made
one
or
two
remarks
which
no
one
understood
there
was
nothing
left
for
pothering
to
say
the
motion
was
then
put
before
the
house
and
the
debate
developed
into
a
farce
idiot
after
idiot
got
up
and
made
some
infantile
qualification
of
an
earlier
statement
all
of
them
talked
off
the
point
so
much
so
in
fact
that
turner
was
beginning
a
tale
of
a
fight
he
had
had
with
a
coster
down
cheap
street
when
christy
called
him
to
order
gordon
at
once
rose
in
protest
gentlemen
i
address
the
chair
it
is
preposterous
that
mr
turner
should
have
been
refused
a
hearing
we
may
have
lost
what
would
perhaps
have
thrown
new
light
on
the
subject
doubtless
he
had
carefully
selected
this
particular
anecdote
out
of
a
life
alas
too
full
of
excitement
a
roar
greeted
this
christy
had
beaten
turner
that
very
morning
for
eating
chocolates
in
german
with
the
express
view
of
pointing
out
the
superiority
of
the
classics
doubtless
the
rough
in
question
not
knowing
the
custom
in
homeric
contests
had
failed
to
propitiate
the
gods
while
he
the
narrator
had
rushed
into
back
lane
behind
mother
beehive
charming
residence
and
having
offered
a
prayer
to
mars
waited
for
his
burly
antagonist
in
the
darkness
and
as
the
vile
man
clearly
one
of
st
paul
haters
that
time
the
sixth
were
reading
the
romans
thundered
by
he
smote
him
with
a
stone
above
the
eye
and
left
him
discomfited
and
like
oedipus
well
nigh
blind
here
we
see
but
the
meeting
never
found
out
what
they
really
saw
gordon
was
called
to
order
and
sat
down
amid
a
tumult
of
applause
one
or
two
more
speakers
brought
fresh
evidence
to
bear
on
the
subject
and
then
there
was
the
division
the
moderns
won
by
a
huge
majority
as
the
rabble
passed
into
the
passage
gordon
heard
ferrers
say
to
christy
in
his
most
patronising
manner
rather
wiped
the
ground
with
you
did
we
well
never
mind
you
stood
no
earthly
days
of
the
classics
are
over
still
you
fought
well
third
line
of
defence
i
remember
a
bit
of
my
classics
gordon
was
borne
out
on
the
stream
past
the
matron
room
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
the
rest
of
ferrers
speech
was
lost
from
this
day
the
stoics
underwent
a
complete
change
the
whole
nature
of
the
society
was
altered
ferrers
was
so
absolutely
different
from
anything
that
a
master
had
appeared
to
be
from
time
immemorial
he
was
essentially
of
the
new
generation
an
iconoclast
a
follower
of
brooke
and
gilbert
cannan
heedless
of
tradition
probing
the
root
of
everything
at
the
end
of
the
term
christy
resigned
his
presidency
he
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
whirlwind
ferrers
you
know
caruthers
said
tester
in
second
hall
whatever
our
personal
feelings
may
be
we
have
got
to
allow
that
this
man
ferrers
has
got
something
in
him
something
why
i
thought
him
simply
glorious
here
he
is
bursting
in
on
the
prude
conventionality
of
fernhurst
full
of
new
ideas
smashing
up
the
things
that
have
been
accepted
unquestionably
for
years
by
jove
the
rest
of
the
staff
must
hate
him
there
was
a
thing
by
him
in
the
the
other
day
that
caused
considerable
annoyance
i
believe
i
did
read
the
thing
myself
but
i
heard
bull
saying
it
was
disgraceful
that
a
fernhurst
master
should
be
allowed
to
say
such
things
i
suppose
he
said
something
against
games
well
damn
it
all
if
he
did
he
is
in
the
wrong
games
are
absolutely
necessary
what
on
earth
would
the
country
be
like
without
them
a
damned
sight
better
i
should
think
oh
do
be
an
ass
just
look
at
the
fellows
who
do
play
games
rudd
and
what
wrecks
they
are
utterly
useless
we
could
do
perfectly
well
without
them
could
not
we
now
at
this
point
betteridge
strolled
in
very
leisurely
authority
had
made
him
a
dignified
person
the
days
of
ragging
trundle
seemed
very
distant
he
did
not
go
about
with
mansell
so
much
now
he
was
more
often
with
carter
and
harding
betteridge
come
in
and
sit
down
said
tester
we
were
arguing
on
the
value
of
games
do
you
agree
with
me
that
it
about
time
a
man
like
ferrers
made
a
sensible
attack
on
them
yes
though
i
doubt
if
ferrers
is
quite
the
man
to
do
it
he
is
such
a
revolutionary
he
would
want
to
smash
everything
at
once
a
gradual
change
is
what
is
needed
i
look
at
it
like
this
games
are
all
right
in
themselves
a
man
must
keep
himself
physically
fit
but
games
are
only
a
means
to
an
end
the
object
of
all
progress
is
to
get
a
clear
race
intellectual
and
broadminded
and
i
think
physical
fitness
is
a
great
help
in
the
production
of
a
clear
clean
mind
the
very
clever
man
who
is
weak
bodily
is
so
apt
to
become
a
decadent
and
because
he
himself
ca
stand
any
real
exertion
despises
those
who
can
games
are
necessary
as
a
means
to
an
end
but
buller
and
all
the
rest
of
the
lot
think
games
are
the
actual
end
look
at
the
way
a
man
with
his
footer
cap
is
idealised
and
worshipped
he
may
be
an
utter
rake
probably
is
most
likely
he
has
no
brains
at
all
if
he
ever
had
them
he
soon
ceased
to
use
them
and
devotes
all
his
energies
to
athletic
success
why
should
we
worship
him
merely
because
he
can
kick
a
rotten
football
down
a
rotten
field
it
is
this
worship
of
athletics
that
is
so
wrong
oh
you
are
talking
rot
burst
out
gordon
angrily
the
english
race
is
the
finest
in
the
whole
world
and
has
been
bred
on
footer
and
cricket
i
own
the
public
school
system
has
its
faults
but
not
because
of
games
it
stamps
out
personality
tries
to
make
types
of
us
all
refuses
to
allow
us
to
think
for
ourselves
we
have
to
read
and
pretend
to
like
what
our
masters
tell
us
to
no
freedom
but
games
are
all
right
we
all
have
our
own
interests
poetry
is
my
chief
one
at
present
but
that
does
blind
me
to
the
fact
that
games
are
what
count
where
should
we
be
without
them
and
i
damn
well
hope
the
house
is
not
going
to
get
into
a
finicky
affected
state
of
mind
despising
them
because
they
are
too
slack
to
play
them
that
why
you
hate
them
betteridge
because
you
are
no
good
at
them
my
great
ambition
is
to
be
captain
of
this
house
and
win
the
three
cock
of
course
the
worship
of
sport
is
all
right
our
fathers
worshipped
it
and
damned
good
fellows
they
were
too
i
ca
stand
you
when
you
talk
like
this
i
am
going
to
find
lovelace
he
has
got
a
bit
of
sense
the
door
slammed
noisily
behind
him
he
is
very
young
said
betteridge
yes
and
full
of
hopes
murmured
tester
it
is
a
pity
to
think
he
will
have
to
be
so
soon
disillusioned
very
little
remains
the
same
for
long
pleasure
is
very
evanescent
betteridge
looked
at
him
a
little
curiously
i
should
not
have
thought
you
would
have
found
that
out
he
said
tester
shrugged
oh
well
you
know
even
the
fastest
of
us
get
tired
of
our
licence
at
times
byron
would
have
become
a
benedictine
monk
if
he
had
lived
to
be
fifty
betteridge
smiled
and
picking
up
a
browning
from
the
table
sank
into
an
to
read
tester
remained
looking
into
the
fire
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
give
himself
away
just
then
it
was
his
great
object
never
to
let
anyone
see
into
his
soul
he
had
once
shown
caruthers
what
he
was
because
he
could
not
bear
to
see
a
person
of
ability
wasting
himself
for
want
of
high
ideals
he
had
tried
to
show
him
that
there
was
something
above
the
commonplace
routine
of
life
and
in
a
way
he
had
succeeded
caruthers
often
came
in
in
the
evenings
to
discuss
poetry
with
him
and
those
were
some
of
the
happiest
moments
of
his
life
he
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
to
him
of
course
caruthers
was
still
young
was
still
under
the
influence
of
environment
but
in
time
he
was
sure
to
realise
that
athletics
were
not
the
aim
of
life
but
only
a
tavern
on
the
wayside
where
we
may
rest
for
a
little
or
which
we
may
pass
by
just
as
our
fancy
takes
us
if
caruthers
saw
this
at
last
he
would
then
have
done
at
least
something
not
altogether
vain
for
after
all
what
a
useless
life
his
had
been
the
road
he
had
travelled
seemed
white
with
the
skeletons
of
broken
hopes
in
the
glowing
coals
he
saw
the
pageant
of
his
past
unroll
itself
he
had
never
been
quite
the
normal
person
his
father
was
a
minor
poet
and
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember
his
house
had
been
full
of
literary
people
arthur
symons
and
george
moore
had
often
discussed
the
relations
between
art
and
life
across
his
fireplace
yeats
had
told
him
stories
of
strange
irish
myths
thomas
hardy
had
read
to
him
once
or
twice
he
had
spent
his
whole
life
with
men
who
thought
for
themselves
who
had
despised
the
conventions
of
their
day
and
he
himself
had
ceased
to
believe
in
anything
except
what
personal
experience
taught
him
he
had
resolved
to
find
out
things
for
himself
and
what
after
all
had
he
discovered
little
except
the
vanity
of
mortal
things
in
his
friendship
with
stapleton
he
had
for
a
term
or
so
found
a
temporary
peace
but
it
had
not
been
for
long
as
soon
as
he
achieved
anything
it
seemed
to
collapse
before
him
he
had
at
times
sought
to
forget
his
failures
in
blind
fits
of
passion
but
when
the
fire
was
burnt
out
the
old
world
was
the
old
world
yet
in
books
alone
he
found
a
lasting
comfort
the
school
looked
on
him
as
quite
a
decent
chap
awfully
fast
of
course
does
care
a
damn
what
he
does
just
lives
to
enjoy
himself
and
have
a
damned
good
time
he
smiled
at
the
irony
of
it
all
if
they
only
knew
but
they
could
never
know
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
saying
so
much
to
betteridge
he
must
not
do
it
again
he
must
go
on
probing
everything
to
discover
where
if
anywhere
was
that
complete
peace
that
perfect
beauty
that
he
had
set
out
to
find
in
the
meantime
the
destiny
of
his
life
would
unfold
itself
he
would
follow
where
his
inclinations
led
him
the
evening
bell
broke
into
his
reverie
he
stretched
himself
come
on
betteridge
let
us
have
a
rag
oh
i
do
think
i
will
i
am
rather
sleepy
betteridge
was
aware
of
his
position
to
tester
being
a
prefect
signified
very
little
that
night
carter
dormitory
was
submitted
to
a
most
fearful
raid
water
flowed
everywhere
two
sheets
were
ripped
and
a
jug
broken
bed
was
upset
on
the
floor
with
rudd
underneath
by
jove
caruthers
said
lovelace
from
harding
dormitory
that
man
tester
is
some
lad
and
gordon
thought
as
he
saw
him
laying
about
him
full
lustily
with
a
pillow
that
all
his
talk
about
games
must
be
merely
a
damned
affectation
he
was
really
like
any
ordinary
fellow
when
peace
was
at
last
restored
and
he
had
led
home
his
victorious
forces
tester
laughed
quietly
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
moonlight
falling
across
a
huge
pool
of
water
he
had
played
his
part
pretty
well
for
the
rest
of
the
term
life
flowed
easily
with
gordon
there
were
no
further
rows
with
the
bull
in
fact
their
row
seemed
for
a
time
at
any
rate
to
have
brought
them
closer
together
both
seemed
anxious
to
be
friends
with
one
another
and
on
the
football
field
gordon
play
gave
really
very
little
cause
for
complaint
for
this
term
his
football
reached
his
highest
level
in
following
seasons
he
played
good
games
on
occasions
but
he
never
equalled
the
standard
he
set
himself
in
the
colts
it
was
one
of
gordon
chief
characteristics
that
he
usually
did
well
while
others
failed
and
this
term
the
colts
for
some
reason
or
other
never
properly
got
together
the
side
kept
on
being
altered
for
a
week
after
the
row
lovelace
was
kept
out
of
the
side
but
it
was
soon
obvious
that
his
presence
was
absolutely
necessary
what
did
i
say
said
gordon
you
see
bull
madness
last
for
long
he
got
a
bit
fed
up
with
you
lovelace
so
he
made
himself
imagine
your
football
was
bad
he
can
always
make
himself
think
what
he
likes
yes
but
it
is
rather
a
nuisance
mansell
remarked
when
you
realise
it
is
always
house
men
who
have
to
do
the
jekyll
and
hyde
business
good
lord
mansell
you
are
becoming
literary
laughed
gordon
how
did
you
hear
of
jekyll
and
hyde
claremont
has
been
reading
the
thing
on
sunday
mornings
not
so
bad
for
a
fool
like
stevenson
it
rather
reminded
me
of
doctor
by
nat
gould
only
of
course
it
is
not
half
so
good
no
that
is
a
fact
said
lovelace
nat
gould
is
the
finest
author
alive
i
read
some
stuff
in
a
paper
the
other
day
about
books
being
true
to
life
well
you
could
not
get
anything
more
true
than
double
and
is
the
most
important
thing
in
life
too
i
sent
up
the
other
day
for
six
of
his
books
they
ought
to
be
here
well
for
god
sake
do
bring
them
in
here
said
gordon
there
is
enough
mess
as
it
is
with
of
the
last
month
trailing
all
over
the
place
oh
have
some
sense
man
you
do
know
what
literature
is
gordon
subsided
all
his
new
theories
of
art
collapsed
very
easily
before
the
honest
philistinism
of
lovelace
and
mansell
for
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
own
views
himself
he
loved
poetry
because
it
seemed
to
express
his
own
emotions
so
adequately
byron
was
as
balm
to
his
rebellious
soul
rebellion
was
in
fact
at
this
time
almost
a
religion
with
him
only
a
few
days
back
he
had
discovered
byron
sweeping
confession
of
faith
i
have
simplified
my
politics
into
an
utter
detestation
of
all
existing
governments
and
he
found
it
a
most
doctrine
that
was
what
his
own
life
should
be
he
would
fight
against
these
masters
with
their
and
puritanic
notions
he
would
be
the
preacher
of
the
new
ideas
it
was
all
very
crude
very
impossible
but
at
the
back
of
this
torrid
violence
lay
an
honest
desire
to
better
conditions
tempered
it
must
be
owned
with
an
ambition
to
fill
the
middle
of
the
stage
himself
in
his
imagination
he
became
a
second
byron
he
saw
or
thought
he
saw
the
mistakes
of
the
system
under
which
he
lived
and
without
pausing
to
consider
its
merits
wished
to
sweep
away
the
whole
foundation
into
the
sea
and
to
build
upon
some
illusory
basis
a
new
heaven
and
new
earth
he
had
yet
to
read
the
essay
in
which
matthew
arnold
says
that
byron
shattered
inevitably
shattered
himself
against
the
black
rock
of
british
philistinism
he
was
at
present
full
of
hope
the
poetry
of
revolt
coloured
his
imagination
to
such
a
degree
that
he
saw
himself
standing
alone
and
triumphant
amid
the
wreck
of
the
world
he
had
overthrown
he
was
always
protesting
that
swinburne
finest
line
was
in
the
to
neither
kneel
nor
adore
them
but
standing
look
to
the
it
raises
a
wonderful
picture
to
a
young
imagination
swinburne
standing
on
a
mountain
looking
across
the
valley
of
years
in
which
man
fights
feverishly
for
little
things
in
which
nations
rise
to
empire
for
a
short
while
in
which
constitutions
totter
and
fall
looking
to
where
far
away
behind
the
mountains
flickered
the
faint
white
streamers
of
the
dawn
oh
he
was
very
young
very
conceited
too
no
doubt
but
is
there
anyone
who
having
lived
longer
having
seen
many
bright
dreams
go
down
having
been
disillusioned
and
having
realised
that
he
is
but
a
particle
in
an
immense
machine
would
not
change
places
with
gordon
and
see
life
once
more
roseflushed
with
impossible
loyalties
in
its
passage
school
life
seems
very
long
in
retrospect
it
appears
but
a
few
hours
there
is
such
a
sameness
about
everything
a
few
incidents
here
and
there
stand
out
clear
but
as
a
whole
day
gives
place
to
day
without
differing
much
from
those
that
have
gone
before
it
we
do
not
realise
this
till
we
can
look
back
on
them
from
a
distance
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
in
the
sixth
gordon
scholastic
career
took
the
way
of
all
other
fugitive
things
it
had
once
given
promise
of
leading
somewhere
of
resulting
in
something
but
it
wanted
more
than
ordinary
perseverance
to
overcome
the
atmosphere
of
the
objection
to
work
that
overhung
all
the
proceedings
in
the
sixth
form
room
and
that
perseverance
gordon
lamentably
lacked
the
lower
sixth
was
mainly
under
the
supervision
of
mr
finnemore
and
it
was
a
daily
wonder
to
gordon
why
a
person
so
obviously
unfitted
should
have
been
entrusted
with
so
heavy
a
responsibility
finally
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
last
headmaster
had
thought
that
the
sixth
form
would
probably
make
less
fun
and
take
fewer
liberties
with
him
than
any
other
form
and
that
when
the
present
chief
had
come
he
had
not
had
the
heart
to
remove
a
school
institution
mr
finnemore
was
an
oldish
man
getting
on
for
sixty
and
his
hair
was
white
he
had
a
long
moustache
his
clothes
carried
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
his
legs
seemed
hung
on
to
his
body
by
hooks
that
every
day
appeared
less
likely
to
maintain
the
weight
attached
to
them
his
face
wore
a
smile
he
was
most
mercilessly
ragged
the
day
when
he
took
exams
in
big
school
will
never
be
forgotten
gordon
was
then
in
the
sixth
the
army
class
and
the
upper
fifth
were
all
supposed
to
be
preparing
for
some
future
paper
all
three
forms
had
of
course
nothing
to
do
the
chief
was
in
london
at
finnemore
was
observed
to
be
moving
in
his
strange
way
across
the
courts
with
an
almost
suspicious
quietness
the
oak
desks
were
filled
what
are
you
doing
lane
finnemore
asked
the
head
of
the
school
i
believe
sir
we
are
supposed
to
be
preparing
something
ah
excellent
excellent
a
very
good
opportunity
for
putting
in
some
good
hard
work
excellent
excellent
for
about
three
minutes
there
was
peace
then
ferguson
lethargically
arose
he
strolled
up
the
steps
to
the
dais
and
leaning
against
the
organ
loft
began
to
speak
gentlemen
as
not
only
the
sixth
form
but
also
the
army
class
and
upper
fifth
are
gathered
here
this
afternoon
with
no
very
ostensible
reason
for
work
i
suggest
that
we
should
hold
on
a
small
scale
a
bacchic
festival
this
will
of
course
be
not
only
entertaining
but
also
instructive
consists
in
knowing
where
to
stop
and
going
a
little
further
once
said
monro
let
us
follow
his
advice
and
that
of
the
greeks
first
let
us
shove
the
desks
against
the
wall
and
make
ready
for
the
dance
it
had
all
been
prepared
beforehand
in
a
few
minutes
several
hundred
books
had
been
dropped
several
lay
smashed
on
the
floor
there
was
a
noise
of
furious
thunder
and
at
last
all
the
desks
somehow
got
shoved
against
the
wall
finnemore
was
magnificently
unprepared
he
lay
back
nervously
in
his
chair
fingering
his
moustache
this
must
now
cease
he
said
no
really
sir
protested
ferguson
everything
is
all
right
mr
carter
will
you
oblige
us
by
playing
the
piano
i
myself
will
conduct
the
floor
of
the
big
school
is
made
of
exquisitely
polished
oak
and
is
one
of
the
glories
of
fernhurst
it
was
admirably
suited
for
the
dance
which
within
five
minutes
was
in
progress
it
was
a
noble
affair
finnemore
sat
back
in
his
chair
powerless
impotent
carter
hammered
out
false
notes
on
a
piano
ferguson
beat
time
at
the
top
of
the
dais
with
a
pen
gently
waving
between
his
fingers
as
gracefully
as
the
pierrots
of
aubrey
beardsley
play
with
feathers
down
below
heavy
feet
pretended
to
dance
to
an
impossible
tune
someone
began
a
song
others
followed
suit
and
before
long
the
austere
sanctity
of
the
room
was
violated
by
the
flat
melodies
of
it
was
indeed
an
act
of
vandalism
but
the
rioters
had
forgotten
that
they
were
distinctly
audible
from
without
in
the
chief
absence
they
had
thought
a
row
out
of
the
question
unfortunately
however
the
bull
was
only
a
few
yards
off
when
first
he
heard
the
strains
of
revelling
borne
upwards
he
thought
it
must
be
the
choir
practising
for
the
christmas
concert
but
it
did
not
take
long
for
him
to
appreciate
that
such
a
supposition
was
out
of
the
question
the
noise
was
deafening
he
could
hardly
hear
himself
talk
investigation
must
be
made
he
got
up
and
walked
out
into
the
courts
made
his
way
to
the
big
school
and
opening
the
door
revealed
the
scene
that
has
just
been
described
for
a
second
or
so
he
stood
speechless
he
felt
much
as
moses
might
have
felt
if
he
had
seen
a
tribe
of
gentiles
invading
the
holy
of
holies
then
his
voice
rang
out
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
unseemly
disturbance
a
sudden
silence
fell
over
the
revellers
as
in
poe
story
of
the
red
death
when
the
stranger
entered
the
room
buller
looked
around
my
form
the
army
class
will
follow
me
disconsolately
his
form
found
their
books
and
moved
out
of
the
room
fully
aware
that
they
would
shortly
have
to
pay
full
price
for
their
pleasure
over
the
remainder
there
fell
a
chill
feeling
of
uncertainty
a
few
spasmodic
efforts
were
made
to
carry
on
but
the
was
gone
the
laughter
was
forced
finally
noise
subsided
into
whispering
and
whispering
into
silence
and
the
scratching
of
pens
there
loomed
before
the
sixth
form
visions
of
a
very
unpleasant
interview
with
the
chief
and
their
expectations
were
not
disappointed
the
whole
form
had
to
stay
back
on
the
last
day
and
write
out
a
georgic
only
the
fifth
got
off
macdonald
was
told
to
deal
with
them
but
he
saw
the
humour
of
the
affair
too
strongly
to
do
anything
but
laugh
these
cambridge
men
ca
keep
order
no
good
at
all
ca
think
why
the
chief
took
him
and
then
after
a
pause
i
wish
i
had
been
there
the
result
of
this
was
that
for
the
future
finnemore
was
treated
with
a
little
more
respect
the
sixth
decided
that
dances
did
not
pay
and
so
contented
themselves
with
less
noisy
but
little
less
aggravating
amusements
for
instance
finnemore
hatred
of
browning
was
a
byword
so
one
day
the
entire
form
decided
to
learn
lost
for
repetition
for
a
while
finnemore
bore
it
patiently
but
when
a
burly
chemistry
specialist
walked
up
to
within
two
feet
of
him
and
began
to
bawl
so
loudly
that
his
actual
words
were
distinguishable
in
the
school
house
studies
the
master
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
murmured
oh
heaven
spare
me
this
infliction
on
another
occasion
betteridge
walked
quietly
up
to
him
handed
him
a
shelley
and
without
any
warning
suddenly
shrieked
out
he
hath
outsoared
the
shadow
of
our
night
finnemore
looked
at
him
sadly
my
dear
betteridge
so
early
in
the
morning
by
many
little
things
his
life
was
made
wretched
for
him
but
yet
he
would
not
have
chosen
any
other
profession
he
had
once
started
life
with
very
high
hopes
but
had
discovered
that
the
world
is
not
in
sympathy
with
men
of
ideas
who
do
not
prophesy
smooth
things
and
so
at
an
early
age
he
found
himself
disappointed
in
all
his
personal
aims
it
seemed
that
he
had
to
harbour
only
the
simplest
wish
to
find
it
denied
and
then
he
realised
that
for
the
loss
of
youth
there
can
be
no
compensation
and
that
in
youth
alone
happiness
could
be
found
and
so
he
had
decided
to
spend
his
life
in
company
with
high
hopes
and
smiling
faces
there
were
times
when
an
immense
sadness
came
over
him
when
he
thought
that
disillusionment
was
waiting
for
so
many
of
them
and
that
there
were
few
who
would
carry
their
looks
or
their
truth
to
the
grave
but
on
the
whole
he
was
as
happy
as
his
temperament
could
allow
him
and
gordon
although
in
a
sense
he
was
the
very
antithesis
of
all
that
he
admired
most
found
himself
strangely
in
sympathy
with
his
new
master
one
day
the
subject
for
an
essay
was
conventionality
and
gordon
unpacked
his
torrid
soul
in
a
wild
abuse
of
all
existing
governments
after
he
had
written
it
he
got
rather
nervous
about
its
reception
but
it
was
returned
marked
and
finnemore
had
written
at
the
bottom
we
all
think
like
this
when
we
are
young
and
after
all
it
is
good
to
be
young
gordon
felt
that
he
had
found
someone
who
understood
him
finnemore
lived
in
two
rooms
over
the
masters
common
room
which
had
from
time
immemorial
been
the
possession
of
the
sixth
form
tutor
and
in
the
evenings
when
gordon
used
to
have
his
prose
corrected
finnemore
would
often
ask
him
to
stay
behind
and
have
some
coffee
then
the
two
would
talk
about
poetry
and
art
and
life
till
the
broken
bell
rang
out
its
cracked
imperious
summons
finnemore
had
once
published
a
small
book
of
verses
a
copy
of
which
he
gave
to
gordon
they
had
in
them
all
the
frail
pathos
of
a
wasted
career
most
of
them
were
songs
of
spurned
affection
and
inside
was
the
quotation
jussit
when
i
look
at
that
book
said
finnemore
to
gordon
i
ca
associate
myself
with
the
author
i
seem
to
have
quite
outgrown
him
and
as
i
recall
the
verses
i
say
to
myself
fellow
life
was
hard
to
you
and
i
wonder
if
he
really
was
myself
with
him
gordon
saw
life
from
a
different
angle
he
presented
the
spectacle
of
failure
and
it
rather
sobered
gordon
wild
enthusiasm
at
times
to
feel
himself
so
close
to
anything
so
bitterly
poignant
but
the
hour
of
youth
domination
even
if
it
be
but
an
hour
is
too
full
of
excitement
and
confidence
to
be
overclouded
by
doubts
for
very
long
usually
gordon
saw
in
him
a
pathetic
shadow
whom
he
patronised
he
did
not
realise
that
it
was
what
he
himself
might
become
through
the
long
tedious
hours
in
the
shadowy
gordon
dreamed
of
wonderful
successes
and
let
others
pass
him
by
in
the
rush
for
promotion
he
began
to
think
that
prizes
and
form
lists
were
not
worth
worrying
about
he
said
a
classical
education
had
such
a
narrowing
effect
on
character
we
can
always
produce
arguments
to
back
up
an
inclination
if
we
want
to
and
in
finnemore
there
was
no
force
to
stir
anyone
to
do
what
they
did
not
want
only
once
a
day
was
gordon
at
all
industrious
and
that
was
when
the
chief
took
the
lower
and
upper
sixth
form
combined
in
horace
and
thucydides
for
the
chief
gordon
always
worked
not
it
is
true
with
any
real
measure
of
success
for
he
had
rather
got
out
of
the
habit
of
grinding
at
the
classics
but
at
any
rate
with
energy
and
during
these
hours
he
began
to
perceive
vaguely
what
a
unprejudiced
mind
the
chief
had
to
the
boy
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
forms
any
headmaster
must
appear
not
so
much
a
living
person
as
the
emblem
of
authority
the
final
dispenser
of
justice
the
hard
analytical
sifter
of
evidence
coldly
sublime
intolerably
just
gordon
had
always
before
looked
on
the
chief
as
a
figurehead
who
at
times
would
unbend
most
surprisingly
and
become
a
man
on
the
cricket
field
for
example
when
in
a
master
match
he
had
fielded
cleanly
a
terrific
cut
at
point
and
played
a
sporting
innings
at
house
suppers
and
most
surprisingly
of
all
when
a
row
was
on
gordon
had
been
unable
to
understand
him
he
could
not
dissociate
him
from
his
conception
of
a
headmaster
a
sort
of
mercury
a
divine
emissary
of
the
gods
sent
as
a
necessary
infliction
yet
at
times
the
chief
was
intensely
human
and
when
gordon
came
under
his
immediate
influence
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
methods
he
saw
in
a
flash
that
at
all
times
his
headmaster
was
a
generous
sympathetic
nature
and
that
it
was
his
own
distorted
view
that
had
ever
made
him
think
otherwise
the
chief
was
so
ready
to
appreciate
a
joke
so
quick
with
an
answer
so
unassuming
so
utterly
the
antithesis
of
any
master
he
had
met
before
there
were
one
or
two
incidents
that
stood
out
clearer
than
any
others
in
gordon
memories
of
his
chief
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
term
before
a
start
had
been
made
on
the
term
work
the
chief
was
talking
about
horace
life
and
characteristics
now
tester
he
said
if
you
were
asked
to
sum
up
horace
outlook
on
life
in
a
single
phrase
what
would
you
say
tester
thought
for
a
minute
or
so
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
die
he
hazarded
the
form
laughed
it
seemed
rather
a
daring
generalisation
but
the
chief
answer
came
back
pat
well
hardly
that
tester
shall
we
say
let
us
eat
and
drink
but
not
too
much
or
we
shall
have
a
he
had
taken
tester
quite
erroneous
estimate
as
a
basis
and
had
exactly
hit
off
horace
character
but
the
following
incident
more
than
any
other
brought
home
to
gordon
how
extraordinarily
broadminded
the
chief
was
carter
was
construing
and
had
made
a
most
preposterous
howler
it
does
not
matter
what
he
had
learnt
the
translation
in
the
notes
by
heart
and
quite
failed
to
connect
it
verbatim
with
the
greek
there
now
you
see
how
utterly
absurd
you
are
said
the
chief
you
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
look
the
words
up
in
a
dictionary
just
because
you
see
what
you
think
is
a
literal
translation
in
the
notes
there
lies
the
fatal
error
of
using
cribs
of
course
when
i
catch
a
boy
in
shell
or
iv
a
using
one
i
drop
on
him
not
only
for
slackness
but
dishonesty
the
boy
is
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
the
rest
and
getting
promotion
undeservedly
but
in
the
sixth
form
you
have
got
beyond
that
stage
we
do
worry
much
about
marks
here
so
there
is
nothing
immoral
in
using
a
crib
it
is
merely
silly
it
tends
to
slack
translation
which
in
the
end
ruins
scholarship
and
by
using
the
notes
as
you
do
carter
you
are
doing
the
same
thing
you
really
must
use
more
go
on
please
harding
gordon
was
amazed
at
such
a
broadminded
view
of
cribbing
he
had
long
since
grown
weary
of
preachers
who
talked
about
dishonesty
without
seeming
to
draw
a
line
between
active
dishonesty
and
passive
slackness
the
chief
realised
that
it
was
deliberate
slackness
that
led
to
dishonesty
not
dishonesty
that
was
incidentally
slack
the
chief
must
be
a
very
wise
man
nevertheless
his
admiration
of
the
chief
did
not
make
him
do
any
more
work
than
was
strictly
necessary
and
gordon
began
to
drift
into
a
peaceful
academic
groove
where
he
did
just
enough
work
to
pass
unnoticed
neither
good
nor
bad
he
had
grown
tired
of
ragging
it
was
such
an
effort
especially
when
the
call
of
football
demanded
of
every
ounce
of
energy
to
drift
may
spell
mediocrity
but
it
also
spells
security
and
after
all
there
was
little
danger
of
gordon
becoming
a
mediocrity
in
other
branches
of
school
life
he
was
far
too
ambitious
for
that
but
his
ambitions
were
not
academic
house
politics
and
athletics
were
sufficient
burdens
for
one
man
in
one
lifetime
other
heights
in
other
lives
and
gordon
believed
in
doing
a
few
things
well
it
was
more
than
lucky
for
gordon
future
that
this
term
he
found
himself
a
success
on
the
football
field
if
he
had
not
he
would
probably
have
sought
a
prominent
position
in
the
eyes
of
the
school
by
more
doubtful
paths
but
as
it
was
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
plunge
into
wild
escapades
to
get
noticed
his
football
attracted
quite
enough
attention
people
spoke
of
his
chances
of
getting
into
the
fifteen
next
year
the
milton
match
was
his
greatest
triumph
mainly
because
the
rest
of
the
side
did
badly
lovelace
played
back
and
made
one
or
two
fine
runs
when
he
got
the
ball
but
as
a
whole
the
side
played
very
burgoyne
was
off
colour
and
collins
excuse
that
he
had
been
overworking
lately
did
not
save
him
from
being
kicked
out
of
the
side
after
the
match
but
gordon
who
had
got
his
colts
badge
on
the
morning
of
the
match
and
so
was
relieved
of
any
anxieties
about
his
place
played
what
he
always
said
was
his
best
game
so
much
so
in
fact
that
buller
after
the
match
said
rotten
absolutely
rotten
with
the
exception
of
caruthers
who
played
magnificently
there
was
only
one
blot
on
his
performance
and
that
though
everyone
laughed
about
it
caused
gordon
some
regretful
moments
afterwards
rightly
or
wrongly
gordon
thought
the
opposite
scrum
half
was
not
putting
the
ball
in
straight
gordon
told
him
what
he
thought
of
him
the
scrum
half
called
him
a
bloody
interfering
bastard
and
told
him
to
go
to
hell
the
next
time
the
scrum
half
got
the
ball
gordon
flung
him
with
unnecessary
force
when
he
was
already
in
touch
right
into
the
ropes
and
from
then
onwards
the
relations
between
gordon
and
the
scrum
half
were
those
of
a
scrapping
match
gordon
came
off
best
he
got
a
bruise
on
the
left
thigh
but
no
one
could
notice
that
while
his
opponent
had
a
bleeding
nose
and
a
cut
lip
the
school
was
amused
but
gordon
overheard
a
milton
man
say
i
do
think
much
of
the
way
these
fernhurst
men
play
the
game
look
at
that
tick
of
a
forward
there
dirty
swine
after
the
game
gordon
apologised
to
the
half
and
exchanged
the
usual
compliments
but
he
could
see
that
the
rest
of
the
milton
side
were
not
at
all
pleased
he
spoke
to
mansell
about
it
my
dear
man
do
you
worry
you
played
a
jolly
fine
game
this
afternoon
and
if
you
go
on
like
that
you
are
a
cert
for
your
firsts
next
year
you
played
a
damned
hard
game
yes
but
it
is
rather
a
bad
thing
for
the
school
is
it
if
we
get
a
reputation
for
playing
rough
but
you
were
playing
foul
and
buller
always
tells
us
to
go
hard
and
play
as
rough
as
we
like
yes
but
still
he
was
not
quite
reassured
though
everyone
told
him
it
was
all
right
however
if
the
bull
made
no
comment
it
looked
as
if
nothing
could
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
bull
had
not
noticed
and
though
christy
in
a
fit
of
righteous
indignation
poured
out
a
long
story
to
him
he
only
smiled
oh
well
i
expect
he
got
a
bit
excited
first
time
he
had
played
footer
for
a
school
side
i
was
a
bit
fierce
my
first
game
for
england
do
blame
him
he
a
keen
kid
and
i
am
sure
the
other
side
did
not
mind
christy
mumbled
indistinctly
no
one
ever
seemed
to
take
much
notice
of
what
he
said
that
evening
however
he
and
rogers
over
a
glass
of
port
agreed
that
caruthers
was
a
thoroughly
objectionable
young
fellow
who
ought
to
be
taken
in
hand
and
with
this
christian
sentiment
to
inspire
him
rogers
went
home
to
put
a
few
finishing
touches
to
his
sermon
for
the
next
day
chapter
ii
carnival
the
tradition
of
pack
monday
fair
at
fernhurst
is
almost
as
old
as
the
school
house
studies
the
legend
whether
authenticated
or
not
only
macdonald
the
historian
of
fernhurst
could
say
was
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
it
was
believed
that
when
the
building
of
the
abbey
was
finished
all
the
masons
and
artificers
packed
up
their
tools
and
paraded
the
town
with
music
and
song
celebrating
the
glory
of
their
accomplished
work
and
from
time
immemorial
the
townspeople
have
celebrated
the
second
monday
in
october
by
assembling
outside
the
abbey
at
midnight
and
ushering
in
a
day
of
marketing
and
revelry
by
a
procession
through
the
town
beating
tin
cans
and
blowing
upon
posthorns
with
the
exception
of
this
ritual
the
day
had
become
merely
an
ordinary
fair
but
there
was
no
sleeping
on
that
sunday
night
and
for
the
whole
week
tantalising
sounds
of
shrieking
of
whistling
tramcars
and
thundering
switchbacks
were
borne
across
the
night
to
disturb
those
who
were
trying
to
work
in
hall
it
used
to
be
the
custom
for
the
bloods
to
creep
out
at
night
and
take
part
in
the
revels
but
when
the
new
chief
had
come
four
years
before
he
put
a
firm
hand
upon
such
abuses
and
had
even
threatened
to
expel
anyone
he
found
in
the
act
a
threat
which
he
had
carried
out
promptly
by
expelling
the
best
in
the
school
a
fortnight
before
the
dulbridge
match
so
that
now
only
a
few
daring
spirits
stole
out
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
on
the
hazardous
expedition
those
courageous
souls
were
the
objects
of
the
deepest
veneration
among
the
smaller
boys
who
would
whisper
quietly
of
their
doings
in
the
upper
dormitories
when
darkness
lent
a
general
security
to
the
secrets
that
were
being
revealed
this
term
about
three
days
before
pack
monday
gordon
mansell
carter
and
a
few
others
were
engaged
in
their
favourite
hobby
of
shipping
rudd
study
one
chair
had
already
gone
the
way
of
all
old
wood
and
the
table
was
in
danger
of
following
it
when
rudd
suddenly
burst
out
oh
you
think
yourselves
damned
fine
fellows
six
of
you
against
one
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
it
was
the
traditional
complaint
of
all
weaklings
in
school
stories
and
was
singularly
of
the
preparatory
school
type
of
defence
jolly
brave
are
you
i
like
to
see
any
one
of
you
do
anything
that
might
get
you
into
trouble
i
do
mind
betting
there
not
one
of
you
that
would
dare
to
come
out
with
me
to
the
fair
next
monday
there
was
an
awkward
pause
the
challenge
was
unconventional
and
the
public
school
boy
is
not
brought
up
to
expect
surprises
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
pass
it
off
with
a
joke
lovelace
stepped
into
the
breach
do
you
think
any
of
us
would
go
anywhere
with
a
swine
like
you
who
does
not
wash
dirty
hog
of
course
you
would
not
you
are
afraid
at
that
point
gordon
hatred
of
taking
the
second
place
which
had
before
led
him
into
difficulties
once
again
asserted
itself
damn
it
all
he
thought
i
am
not
going
to
be
beaten
by
rudd
do
you
say
we
are
all
funks
if
we
do
go
yes
all
right
then
damn
you
i
will
go
with
you
just
to
show
you
that
you
are
not
the
only
person
in
this
rotten
school
who
fool
enough
to
risk
being
bunked
rudd
was
taken
aback
he
had
made
the
challenge
out
of
bravado
he
had
regretted
it
instantly
in
the
same
spirit
gordon
had
accepted
the
challenge
he
also
wished
he
had
not
the
moment
afterwards
but
both
saw
that
they
would
have
to
go
through
with
it
now
good
man
said
rudd
not
to
be
outdone
i
wanted
someone
to
go
with
me
rather
lonely
these
little
excursions
without
company
he
spoke
with
the
air
of
one
who
spent
every
other
night
giving
at
the
eversham
tap
look
here
now
broke
in
mansell
do
make
bloody
fools
of
yourselves
you
will
only
get
the
sack
if
you
are
caught
and
you
probably
will
get
caught
you
are
sure
to
do
something
silly
for
sake
do
go
it
not
worth
it
really
not
oh
shut
up
do
panic
was
gordon
scornful
answer
we
are
going
to
have
a
fine
time
are
we
rudd
splendid
said
rudd
who
wanted
to
laugh
the
whole
situation
was
fraught
with
such
a
perfectly
impossible
irony
oh
do
have
some
sense
man
lovelace
was
impatient
with
him
what
is
the
use
of
rushing
about
at
midnight
in
slouch
hats
with
a
lot
of
silly
shrieking
girls
you
ca
understand
you
live
in
the
country
i
am
a
londoner
you
want
the
true
cockney
spirit
that
goes
rolling
drunk
on
hampstead
heath
on
easter
monday
well
thank
god
i
do
want
it
then
said
lovelace
rumour
flies
round
a
house
quickly
in
hall
several
people
came
up
and
asked
gordon
if
it
was
true
they
looked
at
him
curiously
with
an
expression
in
which
surprise
and
admiration
were
curiously
blended
the
old
love
of
notoriety
swept
over
gordon
once
more
he
felt
frightfully
bucked
with
himself
what
a
devil
of
a
fellow
he
was
to
be
sure
he
went
round
the
studies
in
hall
proclaiming
his
audacity
i
say
look
here
old
chap
you
need
tell
anyone
but
i
am
going
out
to
pack
monday
fair
it
will
be
some
rag
the
sensation
he
caused
was
highly
gratifying
by
prayers
all
his
friends
and
most
of
his
acquaintances
knew
of
it
of
course
they
would
keep
it
secret
but
gordon
knew
well
that
by
break
next
day
it
would
be
round
the
outhouses
and
he
looked
forward
to
the
number
of
questions
he
would
get
asked
to
be
the
hero
of
an
impending
escapade
was
pleasant
i
say
davenport
he
said
in
his
dormitory
that
evening
i
am
going
out
to
the
fair
on
monday
davenport
said
nothing
and
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
gordon
was
disappointed
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
said
at
last
that
you
are
a
sillier
ass
than
i
thought
you
were
said
davenport
and
as
gordon
lay
thinking
over
everything
in
the
dark
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
davenport
was
not
so
very
far
wrong
after
all
cold
and
nervous
gordon
waited
for
rudd
in
the
dark
under
the
chief
study
on
pack
monday
night
just
before
twelve
in
stockinged
feet
he
had
crept
downstairs
opened
the
creaking
door
without
making
any
appreciable
noise
and
then
waited
in
the
which
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
blacking
and
damp
decay
there
was
a
small
window
at
the
end
of
it
through
which
it
was
just
possible
to
squeeze
out
on
to
the
chief
front
lawn
after
that
all
was
easy
anyone
could
clamber
over
the
wall
by
the
a
green
there
was
the
sound
of
feet
on
the
stairs
it
seemed
to
gordon
as
if
they
were
bound
to
wake
the
whole
house
rudd
figure
was
framed
black
in
the
doorway
silently
they
wormed
their
way
through
the
window
the
damp
soil
of
a
flower
bed
was
cold
under
their
feet
with
his
hand
rudd
smoothed
out
the
footprints
they
stole
down
the
silent
cloisters
echoing
shadows
leered
at
them
the
wall
of
the
a
green
rose
dark
and
sinister
at
last
breathless
among
the
tombstones
by
the
abbey
they
slipped
on
their
boots
turned
up
coat
collars
and
drew
their
caps
over
their
eyes
a
minute
later
the
glaring
lights
of
the
booths
in
cheap
street
engulfed
them
they
were
jostled
in
the
crowd
it
was
after
all
only
hampstead
heath
on
a
small
scale
walk
up
walk
up
all
the
fun
of
the
fair
buy
a
teazer
buy
a
teazer
buy
a
teazer
tickle
the
girls
walk
up
try
your
luck
at
the
darts
sir
now
then
sir
come
on
the
confused
roar
was
as
music
to
gordon
soul
he
had
the
cockney
love
of
a
fair
the
children
of
london
are
still
true
to
the
coster
legends
of
the
old
kent
road
gordon
and
rudd
did
not
stop
long
in
cheap
street
the
real
business
was
in
the
fair
fields
by
rogers
house
this
was
only
the
outskirts
the
next
hour
passed
in
a
dream
lights
flared
rifles
snapped
at
fugitive
balls
leaping
on
cascades
of
water
rose
heavenwards
banged
out
choruses
gordon
let
himself
go
he
and
rudd
tried
everything
after
wasting
on
the
cocoanuts
rudd
captured
first
go
at
the
darts
a
wonderful
vase
decorated
with
the
gilt
legend
a
present
from
fernhurst
and
gordon
at
the
rifle
range
won
a
beautiful
china
shepherdess
which
held
for
days
the
admiration
of
the
school
house
until
pining
perhaps
for
its
lover
which
by
no
outlay
of
darts
could
gordon
secure
it
became
dislodged
from
the
bracket
and
fell
in
pieces
on
the
floor
to
be
swept
away
by
arthur
the
school
into
the
perpetual
darkness
of
the
dustbin
weary
at
last
the
pair
sought
the
shelter
of
a
small
café
where
they
luxuriously
sipped
lemonade
faces
arose
out
of
the
night
passed
by
and
faded
out
again
the
sky
was
red
with
pleasure
the
noise
and
shrieks
grew
louder
and
more
insistent
there
was
a
dance
going
on
i
say
rudd
do
you
dance
no
not
much
well
look
here
i
can
a
bit
at
any
rate
i
am
going
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
over
there
let
us
go
on
our
own
for
a
bit
meet
me
here
at
a
quarter
to
four
right
said
rudd
and
continued
sipping
the
lurid
poison
that
called
itself
american
cream
soda
and
was
in
reality
merely
a
cheap
illness
gordon
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
dancing
the
grass
had
been
cut
quite
short
in
a
circle
and
to
the
time
of
a
broken
band
the
town
dandies
were
whirling
round
flushed
with
excitement
and
the
close
proximity
of
a
female
form
the
mænads
and
the
bassarids
murmured
gordon
to
himself
and
cursed
his
luck
for
not
knowing
any
of
the
girls
disconsolately
he
wandered
across
to
the
bijou
theatre
a
hut
where
a
huge
crowd
was
jostling
and
shouting
he
ran
into
something
and
half
apologised
oh
do
mind
me
a
voice
shrieked
excitedly
he
turned
round
and
saw
the
flushed
face
of
a
girl
of
about
nineteen
looking
up
at
him
she
was
alone
i
say
gordon
muttered
nervously
you
look
a
bit
lonely
come
and
have
some
ginger
beer
orl
right
i
do
mind
give
us
your
arm
they
rolled
off
to
a
neighbouring
stall
where
gordon
stood
his
juliet
countless
lemonades
and
chocolates
he
felt
very
brave
and
and
thought
contemptuously
of
davenport
in
bed
dreaming
some
fatuous
dream
while
he
was
engulfed
in
noise
and
colour
this
was
life
from
the
stall
the
two
wandered
to
the
and
towering
high
above
the
tawdry
glitter
of
the
revel
saw
through
the
red
mist
the
abbey
austere
and
still
the
school
house
dormitories
stretching
silent
with
suspended
life
the
peopled
with
ghosts
a
plank
jarred
under
the
boat
garn
surely
it
ai
time
to
stop
yet
wailed
emmie
he
had
gathered
enough
courage
to
ask
her
her
name
have
another
pleaded
gordon
no
let
us
try
the
lively
thing
over
there
these
boats
do
make
me
feel
so
the
was
just
stopping
there
was
a
rush
for
the
horses
gordon
leapt
on
one
and
leaning
down
caught
emmie
up
and
sat
her
in
front
of
him
she
lay
back
in
his
arms
in
a
languor
of
satisfied
excitement
her
hair
blew
across
his
face
stifling
him
on
every
side
couples
were
hugging
and
squeezing
the
sensuous
whirl
of
the
machine
was
acting
as
a
narcotic
numbing
thought
he
caught
her
flushed
tired
face
in
his
hands
and
kissed
her
wildly
beside
himself
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
you
do
mind
do
you
he
murmured
in
a
hoarse
whisper
do
be
so
silly
i
have
been
waiting
for
that
now
we
can
get
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
her
flushed
face
was
hot
on
his
her
hair
hung
over
his
shoulders
the
strains
of
made
me
love
came
inarticulate
with
passion
out
of
the
shrieking
organ
her
elbow
nudged
him
her
lips
were
as
fire
beneath
his
the
machine
slowed
down
and
stopped
gordon
paid
for
five
extra
rounds
dazed
with
new
and
hitherto
unrealised
sensations
gordon
forgot
everything
but
the
strange
warm
thing
nestling
in
his
arms
and
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
passion
of
the
moment
at
last
their
time
was
up
closely
her
hair
on
his
shoulder
they
moved
to
the
dancing
circle
and
plunged
into
the
throng
of
the
shouting
jostling
dancers
of
the
next
two
hours
gordon
could
remember
nothing
he
had
vague
recollections
of
streaming
hair
of
warm
hands
and
of
fierce
wild
kisses
lights
flickered
shot
skywards
and
went
out
forms
loomed
before
him
a
strange
weariness
came
over
him
he
remembered
flinging
himself
beside
her
in
the
grass
and
burying
his
face
in
her
hair
she
seemed
to
speak
as
from
a
very
long
way
off
once
more
the
dance
caught
them
then
lang
struck
up
hands
were
clasped
a
circle
swayed
riotously
there
were
promises
to
meet
next
night
promises
that
neither
meant
to
keep
rudd
was
waiting
impatiently
at
the
café
once
more
the
wall
by
the
abbey
rose
spectral
once
more
the
cloisters
echoed
vaguely
the
window
creaked
as
the
dawn
broke
tempestuously
in
the
sky
gordon
fell
across
his
bed
his
brain
tired
with
a
thousand
memories
all
fugitive
all
vague
all
exquisitely
unsubstantial
with
heavy
tired
eyes
gordon
ran
down
to
breakfast
a
second
before
time
he
felt
utterly
weary
exhausted
incapable
of
effort
people
came
up
and
asked
him
in
whispers
if
everything
had
turned
out
well
he
answered
absentmindedly
incoherently
i
do
believe
you
went
there
at
all
a
voice
jeered
gordon
did
not
reply
he
merely
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
china
shepherdess
that
he
was
about
to
place
on
the
rickety
study
bracket
doubt
was
silenced
the
long
hours
of
morning
school
passed
by
on
leaden
feet
he
seemed
unable
to
answer
any
question
right
even
the
chief
was
annoyed
rain
fell
in
torrents
the
colts
game
was
scratched
on
a
pile
of
cushions
laid
on
the
floor
gordon
slept
away
the
whole
afternoon
from
four
to
six
he
had
to
write
a
greek
prose
in
his
study
the
tea
bell
scattered
his
dreams
he
rose
languidly
with
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
work
unfinished
the
row
of
faces
at
tea
seemed
to
frighten
him
he
felt
as
if
he
had
awakened
out
of
a
nightmare
that
still
held
on
to
him
with
cold
clammy
hands
and
was
trying
to
draw
him
back
once
more
into
its
web
visions
rose
before
him
of
shrieking
showmen
booths
blinking
with
tawdry
yellow
eyes
emmie
hoarse
laugh
grated
on
his
ears
he
was
overwrought
and
wanted
to
shout
to
shriek
to
give
some
vent
to
his
feelings
but
he
seemed
chained
to
the
long
bench
and
his
tongue
was
tied
so
that
he
could
only
mouth
out
silly
platitudes
about
the
weather
and
the
fifteen
chances
on
his
way
back
to
the
studies
he
felt
an
arm
laid
in
his
he
shivered
and
turned
round
half
expecting
to
see
emmie
flushed
exciting
face
peering
up
at
him
he
almost
sighed
with
relief
when
he
found
it
was
tester
look
here
just
come
for
a
stroll
round
the
courts
the
rain
stopped
i
want
to
talk
to
you
they
wandered
out
under
the
lindens
i
suppose
you
did
go
out
last
night
did
you
yes
what
on
earth
did
you
do
it
for
i
am
sick
of
the
whole
affair
gordon
said
petulantly
rudd
called
the
lot
of
us
funks
so
i
know
that
tale
quite
well
tester
broke
in
i
want
to
know
why
you
went
out
at
least
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
to
tell
you
why
you
went
out
because
i
do
think
you
know
yourself
you
have
made
an
awful
fool
of
yourself
you
have
run
the
risk
of
getting
sacked
merely
because
you
wanted
to
be
talked
about
i
did
i
went
because
i
was
jolly
well
not
going
to
have
rudd
calling
me
a
funk
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
does
it
you
did
not
want
to
play
second
fiddle
you
did
want
rudd
to
appear
to
have
scored
you
wanted
to
be
the
central
figure
much
the
same
is
it
the
love
of
notoriety
gordon
murmured
something
inaudible
and
it
is
all
so
damned
silly
you
are
running
the
risk
of
getting
the
sack
and
for
nothing
at
all
i
can
understand
quite
well
anyone
being
drawn
into
anything
dangerous
by
a
strong
emotion
or
feeling
it
is
natural
masters
say
we
should
curb
our
natures
i
do
know
if
they
are
right
that
neither
here
nor
there
there
was
nothing
natural
in
what
you
did
it
was
merely
rotten
imbecility
your
your
fear
of
not
seeming
to
have
done
the
right
thing
you
ca
go
on
like
this
i
own
that
this
term
you
have
been
more
or
less
sane
the
last
two
terms
i
have
often
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
to
you
you
had
no
balance
you
kept
on
doing
silly
little
things
so
as
to
hold
the
attention
of
a
more
stupid
audience
this
term
you
have
stopped
that
sort
of
rot
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
going
to
be
if
you
go
and
do
things
like
this
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
merely
because
you
want
to
look
silly
you
ca
think
how
much
more
silly
you
look
by
playing
the
ruddy
ass
during
the
small
hours
inside
a
stinking
booth
you
ca
afford
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
your
ambition
is
to
be
captain
of
the
house
and
not
a
bad
ambition
either
but
do
you
realise
that
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
real
power
in
the
house
if
you
are
going
to
fight
the
masters
as
you
say
you
will
you
ca
afford
to
fling
away
points
you
must
appear
impregnable
do
be
an
ass
a
master
holds
all
the
high
cards
if
you
play
into
his
hand
he
has
you
done
to
the
world
suppose
you
were
caught
going
out
at
night
your
last
year
what
would
happen
you
might
get
the
sack
at
once
and
all
your
rebellion
would
be
wasted
and
mark
you
a
rebellion
is
wanted
there
is
real
need
of
a
man
who
has
the
strength
of
his
opinions
and
sticks
out
what
the
use
of
it
if
you
go
and
get
sacked
of
course
they
might
keep
you
on
and
ask
you
to
go
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
save
your
face
what
would
your
position
be
then
you
would
be
bound
hand
and
foot
powerless
to
do
anything
life
would
slip
past
you
you
have
got
to
be
above
suspicion
think
however
much
you
may
want
to
do
a
thing
now
however
much
praise
you
may
think
an
action
of
yours
would
get
stop
and
consider
how
it
will
appear
two
years
hence
a
really
serious
row
might
knock
you
out
for
the
rest
of
your
time
here
a
bad
name
sticks
remember
that
think
of
the
day
when
you
are
going
to
be
a
real
power
and
stand
up
for
the
independence
of
the
individual
to
think
as
he
likes
not
as
buller
likes
for
the
independence
of
the
house
to
run
itself
bull
runs
our
house
you
hear
men
say
ca
do
that
buller
would
be
sick
you
have
to
free
them
of
buller
tyranny
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
man
and
if
you
do
you
ca
fight
in
rusty
armour
these
masters
may
be
fools
but
they
have
the
cards
gordon
listened
to
tester
flow
of
words
he
was
furious
but
when
at
last
lights
were
put
out
and
he
lay
back
in
bed
and
watched
the
stars
steadfast
in
love
and
splendour
and
the
moon
immutable
enigmatic
smiling
quietly
he
appreciated
the
truth
of
tester
argument
a
great
battle
was
before
him
he
would
have
to
go
into
it
strong
and
prepared
at
every
point
there
must
be
no
chink
in
his
coat
of
mail
some
day
his
hour
would
come
till
then
he
had
to
wait
in
patience
and
during
the
long
vigil
he
would
keep
his
shield
clean
of
rust
he
would
have
to
think
to
weigh
his
decisions
to
keep
before
his
eyes
the
goal
towards
which
his
ambition
was
set
chapter
iii
broadening
outlook
like
a
huge
reel
of
thread
the
long
winter
term
unrolled
itself
november
drifted
by
with
its
gusty
winds
that
shrieked
in
the
empty
cloisters
december
came
with
its
dark
mornings
and
steadily
falling
rains
the
first
fifteen
matches
were
over
dulbridge
and
tonford
had
both
been
beaten
handsomely
mansell
had
got
his
firsts
the
colts
drew
at
limborne
and
finished
their
season
with
an
overwhelming
victory
over
weybridge
house
games
began
again
and
the
thirds
and
two
cock
became
the
only
possible
topics
of
conversation
during
the
first
half
of
the
term
hazelton
as
was
inevitable
had
had
to
spend
nearly
all
his
time
in
first
fifteen
puntabouts
and
upper
ground
games
the
house
had
seen
little
of
him
but
now
with
all
the
big
matches
over
and
only
the
old
fernhurstians
match
to
come
on
the
last
saturday
of
the
term
he
had
time
to
devote
all
his
energies
to
the
training
of
house
sides
if
he
had
not
talked
so
much
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
strong
silent
englishmen
for
to
all
outward
appearances
he
was
taciturn
unimaginative
but
he
had
a
very
nasty
tongue
and
never
hesitated
to
use
it
at
the
expense
of
his
enemies
as
a
house
captain
he
was
a
distinct
success
he
knew
the
game
well
and
was
able
to
inspire
a
keenness
that
was
not
jingoistic
he
also
had
the
rare
virtue
of
knowing
where
to
stop
he
never
made
sides
play
on
till
they
were
speechless
with
fatigue
as
some
house
captains
had
been
known
to
do
he
was
very
popular
with
his
sides
every
evening
before
hall
there
congregated
in
gordon
study
all
the
old
faces
of
his
first
year
with
one
or
two
new
ones
nowhere
so
easily
as
at
a
public
school
does
one
find
oneself
drifting
apart
from
an
old
acquaintance
not
for
any
real
reason
not
for
any
quarrel
but
merely
because
circumstances
seem
to
will
it
so
but
when
the
thought
of
house
matches
returned
the
old
lot
came
back
together
to
fight
their
battles
over
again
and
to
dream
of
the
silver
cups
glittering
below
the
statue
of
edward
vi
they
were
all
there
hunter
who
had
seemed
to
pass
almost
out
of
gordon
life
since
he
had
begun
to
play
in
the
fifteen
mansell
who
now
spent
much
of
his
time
with
hazelton
betteridge
who
was
more
often
than
not
with
harding
no
study
was
very
convenient
roll
was
held
just
outside
and
when
the
prefect
voice
was
heard
calling
the
first
name
the
door
would
be
flung
open
and
still
reclining
in
they
shouted
out
the
immemorial
sum
about
five
minutes
before
the
hour
of
juniors
from
the
and
the
farther
studies
would
begin
to
collect
round
the
hot
pipes
in
the
passage
fearful
of
being
late
then
in
no
lovelace
would
wind
up
the
gramophone
and
the
strains
of
the
midnight
leaves
for
broke
out
with
deafening
violence
the
concert
lasted
till
the
first
strokes
of
the
hour
had
boomed
out
roll
over
they
all
separated
to
their
various
studies
lovelace
took
out
his
and
began
to
total
up
his
winnings
gordon
either
lay
full
length
in
the
hammock
a
new
and
much
envied
acquisition
which
was
slung
across
from
door
to
window
and
read
for
the
hundredth
time
the
haunting
melodies
of
or
else
as
was
more
usual
wandered
round
the
studies
with
the
magnificent
air
of
indifference
that
marked
all
members
of
the
sixth
then
came
prayers
after
which
gordon
and
davenport
made
for
the
seclusion
of
their
double
dormitory
lights
were
out
at
for
the
big
upper
dormitories
and
till
then
they
used
to
wander
down
the
passage
for
the
ostensible
reason
of
getting
hot
water
but
in
reality
to
watch
with
the
superior
air
of
olympians
the
life
of
lesser
breeds
they
imagined
themselves
great
bloods
during
these
few
minutes
after
prayers
sometimes
when
the
house
tutor
was
supposed
to
be
out
they
would
join
in
a
game
of
football
in
the
passage
but
as
they
were
caught
once
and
each
got
a
georgic
this
pastime
lost
its
charm
usually
they
lolled
in
the
doorway
with
a
perfect
superiority
and
talked
of
the
old
rags
and
discomfitures
of
two
years
back
for
the
benefit
of
admiring
listeners
do
you
remember
when
mansell
slept
in
that
bed
gordon
would
say
no
i
was
not
here
that
term
davenport
would
reply
but
i
forget
when
the
chief
found
betteridge
bed
pitched
on
the
floor
with
betteridge
underneath
and
lovelace
sitting
on
top
was
it
possible
thought
some
small
fry
that
the
great
mansell
who
played
for
the
fifteen
had
once
actually
slept
in
the
same
bed
as
he
occupied
now
had
betteridge
who
had
only
that
night
given
half
the
a
hundred
lines
once
had
his
bed
shipped
on
that
very
floor
it
all
seemed
like
a
gigantic
fairy
story
and
to
think
that
caruthers
had
seen
these
things
but
they
were
not
long
these
moments
of
the
assumption
of
the
godhead
darkness
soon
fell
on
the
long
passage
and
only
whispered
talking
sounded
faint
and
far
away
gordon
and
davenport
then
went
back
to
their
room
and
on
evenings
after
a
hard
game
they
had
a
small
supper
they
had
managed
to
discover
a
loose
board
and
the
floor
space
caused
by
its
removal
served
as
a
cupboard
a
cupboard
so
damp
and
unhealthy
that
the
most
lenient
sanitary
inspector
must
infallibly
have
condemned
it
here
just
before
afternoon
school
they
secreted
ginger
beer
bottles
a
loaf
of
bread
butter
some
tomatoes
and
a
chunk
of
gorgonzola
cheese
in
the
morning
they
carried
away
the
bottles
in
their
pockets
it
would
have
been
much
easier
and
much
more
comfortable
to
have
had
a
meal
in
their
study
but
then
it
would
have
lacked
the
savour
of
romance
the
rule
forbidding
the
importation
of
food
into
the
dormitories
was
very
strict
at
the
end
of
the
term
when
both
were
going
to
leave
that
particular
room
they
nailed
down
the
board
so
that
no
other
marauder
should
imitate
them
they
wished
to
be
unique
but
before
they
did
so
they
put
in
the
mouldy
cupboard
a
lemonade
bottle
and
one
of
the
blue
fernhurst
for
the
michaelmas
term
they
underlined
their
names
in
it
and
left
it
as
a
memento
of
a
few
happy
evenings
i
wonder
said
caruthers
if
years
hence
someone
will
pull
up
that
board
and
find
the
book
and
seeing
our
names
will
wonder
who
we
were
perhaps
said
davenport
and
you
know
they
may
try
and
find
out
something
about
us
in
back
numbers
of
or
in
the
photographs
of
house
sides
do
you
think
they
will
be
able
to
find
out
anything
about
us
i
hope
so
but
how
little
we
know
even
of
the
bloods
of
and
as
likely
as
not
we
ever
be
bloods
it
will
be
rather
funny
if
some
day
of
all
the
things
we
have
done
nothing
remains
but
the
blue
funny
said
davenport
rather
pathetic
i
should
say
at
fifteen
one
is
apt
to
be
sentimental
perhaps
some
rude
fingers
have
already
torn
up
that
board
perhaps
even
now
some
new
generation
of
fernhurstians
is
using
it
as
a
receptacle
for
tobacco
or
cheese
or
any
other
commodity
contraband
to
the
dormitories
but
perhaps
underneath
a
board
in
no
double
dormitory
there
still
repose
that
identical
lemonade
bottle
and
the
with
its
blue
cover
now
sadly
faded
and
its
leaves
turned
up
with
age
to
serve
as
gordon
epitaph
when
all
his
other
deeds
have
perished
in
oblivion
there
is
perhaps
nothing
that
has
made
so
many
friendships
as
a
big
row
or
the
prospect
of
one
we
always
feel
in
sympathy
with
people
whose
aims
are
identical
with
our
own
and
the
principals
in
some
big
row
or
escapade
can
not
help
being
bound
close
together
by
common
ties
a
mutual
danger
has
brought
together
many
pairs
and
among
others
it
showed
gordon
and
rudd
that
they
had
something
in
common
with
one
another
gordon
had
always
looked
upon
rudd
as
a
guileless
ass
who
was
no
good
at
games
did
nothing
for
the
house
and
was
only
useful
as
the
universal
provider
of
cribs
but
after
the
pack
monday
fair
incident
gordon
saw
that
there
was
in
rudd
a
something
which
if
not
exactly
to
be
admired
came
very
near
it
it
was
a
daring
thing
to
challenge
anyone
who
was
willing
to
come
to
the
fair
with
him
and
he
had
not
shown
the
slightest
wish
to
back
out
of
his
agreement
gordon
decided
to
make
his
better
acquaintance
and
in
the
process
was
brought
face
to
face
with
another
fresh
character
a
type
that
was
to
set
before
him
different
aims
and
standards
for
gordon
was
sharp
enough
to
see
more
or
less
below
the
surface
rudd
was
a
new
type
to
him
it
was
clear
that
he
had
some
merits
especially
pluck
and
yet
he
was
no
good
at
games
and
what
was
more
extraordinary
did
not
seem
in
the
least
worried
about
his
failures
gordon
had
always
pitied
those
who
could
not
scrape
into
the
thirds
poor
devils
he
used
to
say
in
the
arrogance
of
his
own
i
expect
they
tried
just
as
much
as
we
did
and
it
must
be
pretty
awful
for
them
to
realise
that
they
are
no
real
use
at
games
at
all
he
had
never
thought
it
possible
that
anyone
with
the
slightest
claims
to
respectability
could
be
quite
indifferent
to
athletic
success
but
rudd
was
after
all
a
presentable
fellow
and
yet
he
did
not
mind
in
the
least
it
was
all
very
strange
only
by
trying
to
see
the
points
of
view
of
others
do
we
get
any
real
idea
of
the
trend
of
human
thought
it
is
quite
useless
to
start
life
with
fixed
standards
and
try
to
bring
everyone
to
realise
their
virtues
we
must
have
some
standard
it
is
true
or
we
should
be
as
rudderless
boats
but
it
is
of
paramount
importance
that
our
standards
should
be
sufficiently
elastic
to
include
new
movements
and
not
until
we
have
tried
and
weighed
in
the
balance
and
considered
and
sifted
the
philosophies
of
others
should
we
attempt
to
form
a
philosophy
for
ourselves
by
nature
gordon
was
arrogant
and
but
by
meeting
types
different
from
himself
and
in
their
company
gaining
glimpses
of
goals
other
than
his
own
his
character
was
undoubtedly
broadened
his
horizon
extended
and
he
managed
to
get
things
into
better
proportion
for
several
people
just
at
this
time
were
influencing
gordon
but
none
more
so
than
ferrers
ever
since
the
stoics
debate
gordon
had
become
a
profound
admirer
of
the
new
master
who
had
banged
into
the
cloistered
fernhurst
life
bubbling
over
with
the
ideas
of
the
rising
generation
intolerant
of
prejudice
and
tradition
clamorous
for
reform
it
was
a
great
sight
to
see
him
walking
about
the
courts
he
was
nearly
always
dressed
the
same
in
his
blue
woollen
waistcoat
soft
collar
and
serge
suit
he
never
walked
anywhere
without
at
least
two
books
under
his
arm
he
was
recognisable
at
once
if
a
stranger
had
glanced
round
the
courts
in
break
and
had
been
asked
afterwards
if
any
of
the
masters
had
attracted
his
attention
he
might
perhaps
have
mentioned
the
bull
powerful
roll
with
a
smile
he
might
have
remarked
on
the
prelatical
rogers
stalking
like
buckingham
half
in
heaven
there
were
six
or
seven
he
have
noticed
but
there
was
only
one
person
whom
he
must
have
seen
whom
he
could
not
possibly
have
failed
to
pick
out
immediately
and
that
was
ferrers
personality
was
written
on
every
feature
of
his
face
every
movement
was
typical
of
youthful
vigour
and
action
his
swing
suggested
a
complete
scorn
of
everything
known
before
he
was
the
great
god
of
gordon
soul
greater
even
than
lovelace
major
had
been
far
greater
than
meredith
as
he
sat
listening
to
finnemore
discussing
artistic
questions
in
form
he
felt
wildly
impatient
to
hear
ferrer
opinion
nothing
seemed
settled
definitely
until
ferrers
had
spoken
and
only
the
army
and
matriculation
classes
had
the
tremendous
advantages
of
doing
english
with
him
most
of
ferrer
time
was
wasted
in
attempts
to
drive
home
mathematical
theories
into
the
dense
brain
of
a
lower
school
set
as
to
his
influence
in
the
school
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
the
bloods
of
course
were
too
completely
settled
in
their
grooves
of
philistinism
and
to
feel
the
force
of
innovation
but
even
on
a
mild
character
like
foster
his
effect
was
startling
great
theory
was
let
boys
take
their
own
time
the
adage
that
it
does
a
boy
good
to
do
what
he
hates
may
be
all
right
for
the
classics
but
it
is
no
good
to
try
that
game
with
literature
find
out
what
a
boy
likes
encourage
him
show
you
are
in
sympathy
with
his
taste
and
once
in
his
confidence
gradually
lead
him
step
by
step
to
the
real
stuff
he
will
follow
you
if
you
only
make
out
you
like
what
he
likes
a
boy
hates
the
superior
attitude
of
quite
good
in
its
way
of
course
a
master
must
get
to
the
boy
level
it
is
fatuous
to
try
and
drag
the
boy
to
his
at
once
and
there
is
abundant
proof
to
show
that
this
plan
was
a
success
when
ferrers
first
came
foster
for
example
read
nothing
but
kipling
and
guy
boothby
during
his
last
term
gordon
found
him
absorbed
in
and
duchess
of
it
would
be
difficult
to
the
good
ferrers
did
at
fernhurst
from
afar
gordon
worshipped
him
he
learnt
from
foster
what
ferrers
had
read
to
his
form
and
what
he
recommended
them
to
read
and
as
soon
as
he
could
he
borrowed
or
bought
the
book
the
school
about
this
time
began
to
find
in
gordon
its
most
generous
patron
at
times
gordon
would
tell
foster
to
ask
ferrers
questions
that
interested
him
and
the
answers
usually
a
little
vague
and
elastic
spurred
gordon
on
to
fresh
fields
his
taste
was
beginning
to
grow
and
football
shop
was
no
longer
his
only
topic
of
conversation
chapter
iv
thirds
there
was
only
one
thing
that
at
all
worried
gordon
just
now
and
that
was
the
behaviour
of
the
hazlitt
brethren
mention
has
already
been
made
of
this
couple
during
their
first
few
terms
they
gave
every
promise
of
developing
into
the
very
worst
types
that
banality
and
athletic
success
can
produce
and
these
expectations
had
been
abundantly
fulfilled
the
elder
brother
had
his
points
but
they
were
few
the
chief
one
being
that
he
was
fairly
good
at
games
which
after
all
is
but
a
negative
quality
but
the
younger
who
was
as
useless
as
he
was
generally
officious
was
entirely
devoid
of
any
redeeming
feature
his
ways
were
the
ways
of
a
slum
child
playing
in
the
gutter
and
his
sense
of
humour
was
limited
to
shouting
rude
remarks
after
other
people
knocking
off
hats
and
then
running
away
his
language
was
foul
enough
to
disgust
even
a
public
school
taste
gordon
loathed
him
one
evening
he
and
lovelace
discussed
the
child
look
here
said
gordon
it
no
good
this
that
unutterable
little
tick
hazlitt
knocked
off
my
hat
as
i
was
looking
at
the
and
i
am
not
going
to
stand
it
by
the
time
i
had
turned
round
he
was
across
the
courts
the
little
swine
he
is
not
fit
to
be
in
a
decent
school
if
he
get
rid
of
the
habits
he
learnt
with
street
cads
in
the
holidays
of
his
own
accord
he
have
to
be
kicked
out
of
them
we
will
wait
for
him
one
day
and
if
we
see
him
knock
a
school
house
straw
off
my
god
we
will
boot
him
to
blazes
right
you
are
it
wo
be
bullying
it
will
be
treating
a
dirty
beast
in
the
only
way
he
can
understand
about
three
days
later
from
their
study
window
they
saw
hazlitt
minor
proceeding
to
the
after
lunch
they
left
their
study
and
walked
into
the
cloisters
hazlitt
minor
read
the
notices
discovered
that
as
he
was
posted
on
no
game
he
must
of
necessity
take
himself
to
the
and
then
looked
round
davenham
was
conscientiously
perusing
a
notice
although
there
was
no
likelihood
of
his
own
name
appearing
on
any
it
is
almost
true
to
say
that
nobody
looked
at
the
board
except
the
people
about
whom
there
are
no
notices
to
read
there
was
an
announcement
four
days
old
to
the
effect
that
mansell
had
been
presented
with
his
first
fifteen
colours
davenham
seemed
to
find
it
vastly
interesting
hazlitt
stole
up
behind
and
knocked
his
hat
flying
across
the
cloister
in
a
second
gordon
and
lovelace
were
on
him
they
did
not
care
in
the
very
least
what
happened
to
davenham
he
played
no
part
in
their
life
but
a
school
house
man
had
been
cheeked
by
a
filthy
little
outhouse
swab
these
aliens
had
to
be
taught
their
place
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
awful
tick
shouted
lovelace
davenham
go
and
fetch
a
hockey
stick
from
tester
study
hazlitt
let
out
with
his
feet
and
caught
gordon
on
the
ankle
but
the
horrible
hack
he
got
in
return
quieted
him
davenham
appeared
with
a
hockey
stick
gordon
managed
to
get
hazlitt
head
between
his
knees
and
lovelace
began
to
give
that
worthy
a
beating
he
was
never
likely
to
forget
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
blubbering
for
mercy
fletcher
passed
by
here
you
are
archie
yelled
gordon
come
and
have
a
shot
at
this
swine
hazlitt
we
are
teaching
him
that
he
ca
go
about
knocking
off
school
house
hats
with
impunity
right
you
are
my
lads
by
the
time
archie
had
finished
hazlitt
had
almost
collapsed
gordon
let
him
go
and
with
a
hefty
boot
sent
him
flying
into
the
cloisters
i
do
think
we
shall
have
any
more
of
him
for
a
bit
said
lovelace
with
satisfaction
no
these
outhouse
lads
want
showing
their
place
from
time
to
time
the
school
house
after
all
is
place
we
are
like
rome
the
mother
city
the
other
outhouses
are
merely
provinces
of
ours
jolly
good
of
us
to
let
them
use
our
buildings
at
all
come
and
change
we
have
done
a
good
deed
my
friends
but
the
matter
did
not
end
there
that
evening
in
buller
dormitories
hazlitt
told
a
story
of
how
caruthers
had
been
bullying
him
for
no
reason
and
hacking
him
till
he
could
hardly
sit
down
he
left
out
lovelace
name
because
lovelace
was
popular
with
the
buller
crowd
news
of
this
reached
felston
the
second
prefect
he
fumed
with
rage
and
sought
gregory
the
buller
house
captain
have
you
heard
the
latest
that
swine
caruthers
has
been
bullying
hazlitt
he
drove
him
all
round
the
cloisters
hitting
him
with
a
hockey
stick
good
god
the
swine
did
he
really
my
word
i
lay
him
out
in
the
three
cock
you
wait
that
all
when
he
plays
in
the
three
cock
lay
him
out
for
dead
in
the
first
ten
minutes
in
due
course
this
story
found
its
way
to
the
buller
where
was
great
rejoicing
so
caruthers
was
going
to
be
laid
out
was
he
how
damned
funny
hazlitt
heart
leapt
within
him
his
evil
little
mind
pictured
gordon
being
carried
off
the
field
absolutely
smashed
up
he
gloated
gordon
laughed
when
he
heard
of
it
oh
well
at
any
rate
i
shall
have
my
shot
at
them
first
in
the
thirds
and
two
cock
he
was
secretly
rather
pleased
to
see
that
even
his
enemies
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
his
getting
a
place
in
the
three
cock
a
house
cap
was
just
then
his
great
ambition
but
for
all
that
he
suffered
considerable
annoyance
whenever
he
went
up
to
the
a
voice
from
the
buller
doorway
croaked
wait
for
the
three
cock
at
first
it
was
rather
amusing
but
soon
it
got
distinctly
tiresome
deep
in
his
heart
he
cursed
the
tick
hazlitt
and
the
whole
buller
crowd
a
joke
could
be
carried
to
an
extreme
and
it
slowly
dawned
on
him
that
if
he
did
play
in
the
three
cock
he
was
in
for
a
remarkably
thin
time
almost
the
last
words
he
heard
as
the
swept
out
of
fernhurst
station
on
the
last
morning
with
its
waving
hands
and
shoutings
was
a
shriek
from
the
buller
wait
for
the
three
cock
gordon
laughed
for
a
second
and
then
looked
bored
the
jest
had
ceased
to
have
a
shred
of
humour
left
upon
it
it
was
naked
and
ought
to
be
ashamed
the
easter
term
opened
in
the
conventional
way
with
rain
slush
and
influenza
the
fields
were
flooded
the
country
a
lake
the
bare
branches
dripped
incessantly
but
for
all
that
the
first
round
of
the
thirds
began
on
the
first
saturday
buller
drew
rogers
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
result
it
would
be
a
for
buller
though
burgoyne
might
get
over
the
line
once
or
twice
there
was
a
crowd
in
front
of
the
pavilion
well
do
something
at
any
rate
said
gordon
do
let
buller
get
above
themselves
you
keep
them
in
order
oh
yes
we
sit
on
them
laughed
burgoyne
by
the
way
i
think
it
would
be
rather
a
good
scheme
to
lay
out
hazlitt
minor
do
you
never
did
any
forward
in
any
house
match
at
fernhurst
take
the
field
without
the
sworn
intention
of
laying
out
some
hated
opponent
nevertheless
during
the
whole
time
gordon
was
at
school
only
one
boy
was
hurt
so
badly
that
he
had
to
leave
the
field
and
that
was
an
accident
he
broke
his
falling
over
by
the
it
had
become
almost
a
custom
to
state
whom
you
were
going
to
lay
out
before
the
match
the
idea
sounds
brutal
but
it
never
led
to
anything
gordon
knew
this
as
well
as
anyone
good
man
and
look
here
if
you
do
i
give
you
a
bob
a
bargain
of
course
right
my
lad
we
will
have
a
good
supper
in
my
study
the
match
followed
the
ordinary
course
frenzied
juniors
rushed
up
and
down
the
inarticulate
with
excitement
the
bloods
strolling
arm
in
arm
patronised
the
game
mildly
buller
won
very
easily
hazlitt
played
quite
decently
and
scored
once
burgoyne
went
supperless
the
second
and
third
rounds
were
played
everywhere
buller
triumphed
no
house
was
beaten
by
less
than
forty
points
not
a
try
was
scored
against
them
christy
who
had
lost
by
points
to
nil
had
as
the
least
unsuccessful
house
the
doubtful
honour
of
joining
forces
with
buller
to
play
the
school
house
in
the
final
the
betting
was
fairly
even
buller
thought
they
would
win
the
house
as
usual
was
certain
of
victory
the
school
expected
a
level
game
and
on
the
whole
wanted
to
see
a
school
house
win
buller
had
had
too
much
success
of
late
years
and
envy
was
inevitably
at
work
the
selection
of
the
combined
outhouse
side
caused
a
lot
of
consideration
there
was
once
an
idea
of
playing
hazlitt
minor
but
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
house
this
plan
was
from
the
outhouse
point
of
view
wisely
dropped
and
now
jack
whitaker
he
was
always
known
as
jack
enters
the
story
jack
was
a
very
decent
sort
of
kid
much
in
the
school
house
estimation
above
the
standard
of
buller
he
was
a
little
rowdy
and
ostentatious
but
had
the
justification
of
being
really
good
at
something
he
was
a
promising
and
his
cricket
was
so
good
that
there
was
talk
of
his
getting
a
trial
for
the
school
eleven
gordon
and
he
got
on
rather
well
but
he
was
very
young
under
fifteen
in
fact
and
very
impetuous
about
a
week
before
the
thirds
the
bull
was
discussing
the
match
in
the
dormitories
jack
was
very
full
of
words
i
say
sir
is
it
awfully
lucky
for
hazlitt
that
he
is
not
playing
the
bull
was
surprised
only
that
evening
he
had
been
talking
with
hazlitt
and
telling
him
how
sorry
he
was
that
there
was
no
place
for
him
in
the
side
why
jack
i
do
know
what
you
mean
oh
well
you
see
sir
all
the
school
house
fellows
had
sworn
to
lay
him
out
you
must
not
talk
like
that
jack
it
is
not
sporting
and
it
stirs
up
ill
feeling
in
the
school
you
ca
honestly
believe
that
any
gentleman
would
play
a
game
in
that
spirit
you
have
no
proof
of
what
you
say
except
mere
rumour
i
suppose
you
must
talk
like
that
the
bull
was
not
at
all
pleased
and
walked
away
to
turn
out
the
light
whitaker
saw
he
had
gone
too
far
and
had
said
more
than
he
meant
to
but
he
could
stand
the
idea
that
the
bull
should
think
he
had
been
repeating
merely
idle
chatter
but
sir
i
know
for
certain
that
in
the
christy
match
the
school
house
men
were
offering
money
to
christy
to
lay
hazlitt
out
buller
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
that
is
a
very
serious
accusation
jack
are
you
telling
me
that
any
fernhurst
boys
so
lack
sportsmanlike
feeling
as
to
bribe
boys
in
other
houses
to
lay
out
their
rivals
so
that
it
will
be
easier
for
them
to
win
oh
sir
i
do
think
that
they
meant
that
well
you
said
it
at
any
rate
the
gas
went
out
suddenly
the
bull
strode
out
without
saying
in
his
study
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
the
extraordinary
story
he
had
heard
if
what
jack
had
told
him
was
the
truth
fernhurst
football
which
was
to
him
and
to
many
others
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
had
become
little
better
than
league
professionalism
bribes
were
being
offered
for
men
to
be
laid
out
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
there
was
no
one
to
remind
him
that
the
offering
of
bribes
means
little
to
a
schoolboy
and
the
mere
talk
of
laying
people
out
still
less
it
is
all
a
question
of
custom
of
the
sense
in
which
phrases
are
used
by
the
particular
speakers
who
use
them
there
are
certain
words
which
are
vulgar
and
disgusting
but
which
in
the
days
of
shakespeare
would
have
been
used
in
any
company
without
a
blush
and
this
is
so
merely
because
time
has
given
the
words
a
different
significance
indeed
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
average
person
to
leave
schoolmasters
out
of
the
question
the
idea
of
offering
bribes
to
lay
out
athletes
is
revolting
and
so
it
is
it
is
unsportsmanlike
unworthy
of
english
traditions
but
when
gordon
offered
burgoyne
a
shilling
to
lay
out
hazlitt
although
he
said
it
was
a
bargain
he
meant
nothing
at
all
by
his
offer
he
knew
that
burgoyne
once
he
got
on
the
field
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
game
and
would
forget
all
about
hazlitt
and
himself
everyone
offered
bribes
but
no
one
had
been
known
to
receive
a
penny
of
them
still
buller
could
not
be
expected
to
know
this
he
saw
in
the
affair
a
menace
to
the
future
of
fernhurst
sport
jack
story
might
be
only
idle
chatter
or
it
might
have
some
foundation
at
any
rate
he
had
got
to
go
to
the
bottom
and
sift
out
the
truth
for
the
good
of
fernhurst
after
evening
chapel
on
the
sunday
before
the
match
the
chief
sent
for
gordon
when
gordon
arrived
he
found
harding
the
head
of
the
house
there
too
the
chief
looked
worried
there
was
a
row
in
prospect
gordon
racked
his
brain
to
think
of
anything
that
could
possibly
have
been
found
out
about
him
of
course
there
were
many
old
troubles
that
might
have
been
raked
up
he
had
always
realised
that
the
hand
of
the
past
would
still
be
near
the
shoulder
of
the
present
yet
what
had
he
been
doing
recently
is
hazelton
coming
harding
the
chief
was
speaking
yes
sir
but
i
believe
he
is
collecting
chapel
cards
hazelton
too
complications
forsooth
there
was
an
awkward
pause
then
hazelton
came
in
quite
at
his
ease
sir
the
chapel
cards
and
i
believe
you
wanted
to
see
me
sir
ah
yes
hazelton
put
the
cards
on
my
desk
now
caruthers
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
before
the
head
and
captain
of
the
house
that
i
hope
you
will
answer
truthfully
did
you
offer
a
boy
in
mr
christy
house
money
to
out
i
believe
that
was
the
phrase
a
boy
in
mr
house
in
the
recent
house
match
gordon
thought
for
a
moment
had
he
it
was
quite
likely
he
had
but
he
could
not
remember
then
the
scene
came
back
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
pavilion
burgoyne
hazlitt
in
the
offing
yes
sir
he
replied
after
the
instant
hesitation
you
seem
rather
doubtful
about
it
well
sir
i
was
trying
to
remember
whether
i
had
or
not
the
chief
was
nettled
by
such
apparent
callousness
you
talk
as
if
you
were
in
the
habit
of
offering
such
rewards
are
you
well
sir
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
any
fellow
might
do
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
doubt
the
truth
of
your
statement
very
much
but
even
if
the
school
had
become
so
generally
demoralised
as
you
suggest
that
would
not
be
any
excuse
for
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
how
much
did
you
offer
the
boy
a
shilling
sir
was
that
a
genuine
offer
now
if
he
had
done
what
you
wanted
him
to
would
you
have
paid
him
gordon
was
now
well
out
of
his
depth
explanation
seemed
impossible
had
the
offer
been
genuine
he
supposed
it
had
if
the
tick
had
been
laid
out
gordon
would
have
been
so
delighted
that
he
would
have
stood
the
whole
of
christy
drinks
all
round
yes
sir
he
said
quite
cheerfully
a
smile
that
rose
to
hazelton
lips
was
instantly
suppressed
ah
rather
like
hiring
assassins
in
the
cheap
novelettes
what
was
your
idea
did
you
think
hazlitt
would
have
been
a
help
to
the
school
side
no
sir
i
hardly
think
he
would
have
been
of
much
assistance
to
them
the
idea
of
hazlitt
being
of
any
use
to
anyone
was
very
amusing
gordon
always
saw
the
funny
side
of
everything
as
a
ghost
he
would
probably
have
found
something
cynically
amusing
in
his
own
funeral
then
you
did
it
merely
out
of
spite
i
suppose
do
you
consider
that
the
football
field
is
a
suitable
opportunity
for
the
of
old
scores
now
suppose
gordon
had
poured
out
the
story
of
how
felston
had
sworn
to
lay
him
out
in
the
three
cock
and
how
hazlitt
and
others
had
flung
the
words
three
cock
into
his
face
for
half
a
term
it
would
have
been
certainly
an
extenuation
but
he
realised
that
hazelton
was
present
it
would
not
be
the
proper
thing
it
would
indeed
be
unpardonable
cheek
for
him
to
talk
in
the
presence
of
the
house
captain
as
though
his
chances
of
playing
in
the
three
cock
were
to
be
taken
for
granted
it
would
be
madness
to
imperil
his
chances
on
the
football
field
merely
because
he
wanted
an
excuse
for
a
silly
little
row
and
so
he
did
not
answer
well
caruthers
i
want
you
any
more
thank
you
for
being
so
frank
in
the
matter
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
is
the
only
extenuating
circumstance
harding
hazelton
one
minute
gordon
returned
to
the
studies
amused
rather
than
disconcerted
he
quite
saw
that
the
chief
with
his
high
ideals
would
refuse
to
allow
two
blacks
to
make
a
white
even
if
that
black
were
of
the
shade
of
which
colour
boys
were
allowed
to
get
their
school
suits
made
and
which
produced
anything
from
light
grey
to
dark
brown
he
understood
and
respected
the
chief
point
of
view
entirely
but
with
the
bull
he
was
furious
no
one
but
the
bull
could
have
reported
him
and
the
bull
after
all
was
an
old
fernhurstian
he
knew
the
school
customs
and
unless
his
memory
was
decaying
must
have
remembered
the
wild
way
in
which
boys
boast
he
must
have
known
it
but
for
the
sake
of
fernhurst
buller
would
say
this
leprosy
has
to
be
rooted
out
gordon
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
really
a
love
of
fernhurst
that
was
his
standard
for
all
actions
or
simply
a
supreme
egotism
which
embraced
alternately
his
own
interest
his
house
interest
and
fernhurst
interest
but
never
under
any
circumstances
never
the
school
house
interest
hazelton
thought
much
the
same
at
the
chief
request
he
made
a
characteristic
speech
to
the
house
after
prayers
someone
who
imagines
himself
a
sportsman
and
who
refuses
to
disclose
his
name
but
whose
identity
we
can
only
guess
at
has
been
making
some
silly
remarks
about
certain
play
and
behaviour
in
the
house
of
course
that
is
all
rot
but
people
have
strange
ideas
especially
those
in
authority
and
we
have
to
be
very
careful
so
for
heaven
sake
do
go
shouting
out
that
you
are
going
to
lay
everyone
out
it
only
means
a
row
and
after
all
you
can
do
it
just
as
well
without
talking
about
it
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
the
old
system
survived
next
morning
in
break
gordon
passed
buller
on
his
way
to
the
the
bull
cut
him
dead
the
day
after
the
chief
having
made
up
his
mind
on
the
matter
told
gordon
that
his
sixth
form
privileges
had
been
taken
away
before
a
large
crowd
in
full
view
of
chief
study
window
gordon
that
afternoon
burnt
his
straw
hat
with
the
sixth
form
ribbon
on
it
and
stood
over
the
smouldering
ashes
proclaiming
in
tragic
tones
the
glory
has
departed
from
israel
his
old
passion
for
a
theatrical
piece
of
rodomontade
was
not
yet
subdued
for
a
short
time
gordon
was
rather
worried
about
hazlitt
as
tester
called
it
but
he
soon
forgot
it
entirely
in
the
excitement
of
the
approaching
match
everyone
talked
about
it
there
was
no
other
topic
of
conversation
the
night
before
the
match
lovelace
could
not
sit
still
for
a
minute
he
strode
up
and
down
the
study
murmuring
to
himself
we
ca
lose
we
ca
we
ca
someone
looked
in
to
ask
if
he
was
going
to
prepare
the
livy
livy
he
gasped
who
could
do
any
work
the
night
before
a
house
match
the
someone
retired
discomforted
you
know
it
absurd
lovelace
went
on
for
a
master
to
imagine
anyone
could
do
work
when
the
house
matches
are
on
the
other
day
claremont
had
me
up
and
asked
me
why
my
work
had
been
so
bad
lately
i
told
him
that
the
house
matches
were
so
exciting
that
i
could
not
concentrate
my
mind
on
anything
else
he
looked
at
me
vacantly
and
said
are
they
really
i
do
know
whom
they
excite
they
do
excite
me
dear
old
poseur
he
keen
enough
on
his
own
house
gordon
answered
drowsily
from
the
depths
of
the
hammock
in
which
he
had
almost
fallen
asleep
he
felt
incapable
of
thought
for
weeks
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
match
and
now
it
was
so
close
he
felt
strangely
languorous
tired
in
brain
and
body
rain
fell
steadily
all
night
and
though
it
cleared
off
about
break
the
ground
was
already
under
water
it
was
a
cold
gusty
day
by
lunch
the
whole
house
was
unbalanced
there
was
much
loud
laughter
then
sudden
silences
an
atmosphere
of
restlessness
lay
over
everyone
very
slowly
the
minutes
dragged
by
gordon
sat
silent
in
a
far
corner
of
the
pavilion
at
last
the
whistle
blew
the
magenta
and
black
jerseys
trailed
out
on
to
the
field
a
cheer
rose
from
the
line
the
next
hour
passed
in
a
whirl
of
white
jerseys
gradually
turned
black
with
mud
of
magenta
forms
dashing
on
to
the
school
forwards
of
wild
inarticulate
black
insects
bawling
on
the
the
pervading
impression
was
mud
everything
was
mud
he
was
mud
the
ball
was
mud
lovelace
was
indistinguishable
his
own
voice
leading
the
scrum
seemed
strangely
unreal
there
was
a
vague
feeling
of
disquiet
when
early
in
the
first
half
he
found
himself
standing
under
the
posts
while
the
buller
half
placed
the
ball
for
whitaker
to
convert
nothing
tangible
then
the
disquiet
passed
the
magenta
jerseys
swept
forward
dirty
white
forms
came
up
and
went
down
before
them
morgan
rolled
over
the
line
a
kick
failed
came
hazelton
came
on
and
said
a
lot
of
things
to
him
which
he
answered
unconsciously
a
whistle
blew
once
more
the
magenta
jerseys
swept
everything
before
them
there
seemed
no
white
jerseys
at
all
numberless
times
he
watched
lovelace
taking
the
place
kick
he
thought
he
heard
mansell
shrieking
heave
it
into
them
well
done
now
you
got
them
once
he
had
a
sensation
of
kicking
the
ball
past
the
halves
he
seemed
clear
the
rushed
up
and
fell
in
front
of
him
the
ball
stopped
for
a
second
then
rolled
on
he
heard
someone
coming
up
behind
him
the
line
grew
dimly
white
under
his
feet
he
fell
on
the
ball
there
was
a
roar
of
cheering
the
whistle
went
in
short
sharp
blasts
the
game
was
over
and
then
he
realised
that
the
house
had
won
that
his
hopes
were
satisfied
that
the
buller
crowd
had
been
routed
that
the
cup
would
shimmer
on
the
mantelpiece
a
wave
of
wild
exultation
came
over
him
the
house
poured
over
the
yelling
and
shouting
it
was
all
a
wonder
and
a
wild
desire
then
came
the
glorious
reaction
the
bright
glory
of
after
battle
wine
the
tea
in
the
they
were
out
of
training
then
the
perfect
laziness
of
lying
in
his
hammock
talking
of
the
splendid
victory
then
came
the
house
tea
it
was
much
like
the
roman
triumph
the
whole
house
sat
in
their
places
ten
minutes
before
six
tablecloths
were
removed
everyone
took
down
heavy
books
boots
sticks
then
when
the
abbey
struck
six
lovelace
led
the
side
into
hall
up
to
the
dais
to
the
sixth
form
table
everyone
shouted
roared
beat
the
tables
dust
arose
it
was
very
hard
to
breathe
the
chief
came
and
made
a
speech
there
was
more
shouting
more
shrieking
more
beating
of
tables
at
last
hall
came
with
its
gift
of
real
rest
gordon
lay
in
the
hammock
lovelace
reposed
with
his
feet
on
the
table
everyone
came
in
to
congratulate
them
hazelton
invited
them
in
second
hall
to
supper
in
the
games
study
the
gramophone
played
choruses
gordon
sang
all
of
them
everyone
was
gloriously
unutterably
happy
meredith
sent
a
wire
well
done
house
now
for
the
two
cock
in
the
dormitory
hazelton
was
talking
over
the
match
by
jove
when
that
side
is
the
three
cock
we
shall
win
by
fifty
points
lord
i
do
envy
you
caruthers
you
will
see
the
day
and
be
in
at
the
finish
i
shall
only
shout
from
the
and
he
added
my
god
i
shall
shout
too
there
was
nothing
to
mar
the
extreme
joyousness
of
life
the
world
lay
at
gordon
feet
he
had
only
to
stoop
to
pick
it
up
chapter
v
dual
personality
the
two
cock
was
always
played
a
fortnight
after
the
thirds
and
during
that
fortnight
the
outhouses
had
to
play
off
among
themselves
three
preliminary
rounds
for
them
it
was
a
remarkably
strenuous
time
the
two
best
outhouses
sides
had
in
fact
to
play
four
house
matches
in
twelve
days
but
it
was
possible
for
the
school
house
to
take
things
easily
for
at
least
half
a
week
and
these
three
days
out
of
training
meant
a
lot
to
gordon
and
others
who
would
have
to
play
not
only
in
the
two
cock
but
most
probably
in
the
three
cock
as
well
it
prevented
staleness
and
staleness
was
the
great
danger
that
all
outhouse
sides
had
to
face
the
week
after
the
thirds
was
regarded
as
a
fairly
slack
time
before
the
strenuous
week
that
culminated
in
the
two
cock
there
would
probably
be
only
one
game
on
the
saturday
and
that
a
short
affair
it
was
usually
a
quite
uneventful
time
this
term
however
an
occurrence
took
place
that
had
a
big
effect
on
the
growth
of
gordon
character
finnemore
had
caught
influenza
the
chief
had
to
go
for
a
week
to
oxford
the
sixth
was
at
a
loose
end
various
masters
took
it
in
various
subjects
or
at
least
were
supposed
to
most
of
the
week
was
spent
in
the
studies
as
the
master
in
charge
forgot
to
turn
up
one
afternoon
ferrers
was
to
take
them
in
english
but
ferrers
was
engaged
in
writing
an
article
on
the
new
public
school
boy
for
cornhill
and
wanted
to
be
quiet
he
sent
the
form
to
their
studies
to
write
an
essay
on
a
typical
ferrers
subject
poetry
is
in
the
first
instance
the
outpouring
of
a
rebel
it
had
to
be
shown
up
by
six
gordon
revelled
in
it
during
the
long
afternoon
he
poured
out
his
fierce
soul
his
life
was
now
a
strange
paradox
half
the
time
he
thought
of
poetry
worshipping
any
sort
of
rebellion
against
the
conventional
standards
of
living
at
other
times
he
was
like
the
ordinary
philistine
blindly
worshipping
games
never
seeing
that
they
led
nowhere
and
were
as
a
blind
alley
this
afternoon
gordon
forgot
everything
but
swinburne
byron
rossetti
and
the
poets
of
revolt
he
stigmatised
wordsworth
as
a
doddering
old
man
not
knowing
that
his
return
to
nature
was
the
greatest
revolution
in
english
literature
in
a
he
saw
shelley
described
as
a
rebel
he
got
a
copy
of
his
works
out
of
the
library
but
found
little
there
resembling
the
work
of
his
own
favourite
however
he
quoted
a
verse
out
of
world
o
life
o
time
and
decided
to
search
more
deeply
later
on
the
bulk
of
the
essay
was
a
glowing
eulogy
of
hymn
to
and
it
was
very
dogmatic
very
absurd
in
parts
but
it
had
the
merit
of
enthusiasm
and
at
any
rate
showed
a
genuine
appreciation
of
a
certain
class
of
literature
well
satisfied
he
made
his
way
across
to
the
sixth
form
room
and
found
ferrers
gazing
at
a
pile
of
papers
as
hercules
must
have
gazed
at
the
augean
stables
um
said
ferrers
who
are
you
caruthers
sir
i
have
brought
you
the
essay
you
set
the
sixth
right
let
have
a
look
at
it
hope
it
is
better
than
the
stuff
i
have
just
been
reading
yes
yes
um
ah
he
murmured
to
himself
as
he
read
on
there
was
clearly
some
hankering
after
style
some
searching
for
an
idea
ferrers
dearly
wanted
to
smile
at
the
attack
on
wordsworth
and
the
comparison
between
swinburne
and
milton
whom
gordon
had
never
read
all
in
favour
of
the
but
he
knew
that
it
would
be
a
fatal
thing
to
do
it
would
seem
superior
the
master
must
come
down
to
the
boy
level
he
read
on
to
the
end
of
the
wild
sprawling
peroration
not
bad
stuff
caruthers
not
bad
at
all
far
and
away
better
than
anything
i
have
so
far
struck
i
must
talk
to
you
again
about
this
i
am
glad
you
love
byron
i
do
myself
people
run
him
down
fools
that
is
you
stick
to
byron
he
is
all
right
and
do
despise
the
rest
too
much
have
a
shot
at
keats
and
shelley
they
are
not
so
powerful
but
good
all
the
same
very
fine
stuff
try
pot
of
must
rush
off
now
are
you
in
training
no
not
yet
right
come
up
to
tea
and
thus
began
a
friendship
that
was
the
most
permanent
in
school
career
every
friday
he
used
to
climb
up
the
hill
past
rogers
house
and
step
out
down
the
white
london
road
to
ferrers
cosy
little
home
over
a
cup
of
tea
he
read
an
essay
ferrers
would
lie
back
listening
and
then
discuss
it
with
him
he
sometimes
blamed
the
actual
expression
of
it
but
he
never
found
fault
on
questions
of
taste
he
let
gordon
browse
at
will
in
the
fields
of
english
literature
he
suggested
books
he
thought
gordon
would
like
he
did
not
try
to
rush
him
on
there
was
heaps
of
time
he
would
let
gordon
develop
on
his
own
lines
from
these
evenings
gordon
derived
a
pleasure
that
he
found
it
hard
to
explain
he
was
thankful
to
get
away
from
the
footer
talk
the
inevitable
intrigues
scandals
all
in
fact
that
went
to
form
the
daily
curriculum
the
world
of
ideas
was
far
more
attractive
ferrers
although
himself
a
blue
looked
upon
games
as
a
recreation
and
upon
school
life
as
a
that
had
to
be
washed
clean
poetry
drama
the
modern
novel
these
were
what
ferrers
loved
and
gordon
was
glad
to
find
someone
who
thought
like
this
he
felt
uplifted
after
his
talks
with
ferrers
he
walked
back
to
the
house
buoyant
as
it
were
on
wings
then
as
the
school
gates
rose
before
him
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
football
bouncing
in
the
court
the
old
routine
caught
him
once
more
he
plunged
into
the
old
life
with
the
same
zest
he
devised
a
new
scheme
for
avoiding
work
thought
out
an
idea
for
teaching
forwards
to
heel
laughed
discussed
athletics
and
was
well
content
he
tried
to
analyse
his
feelings
but
could
not
he
was
now
two
separate
persons
at
times
he
was
the
dreamer
the
lover
of
art
and
poetry
at
another
the
politician
the
fighter
who
lived
every
minute
of
his
life
deeply
to
the
full
with
one
fixed
aim
before
him
gordon
wondered
if
this
apparent
paradox
in
himself
was
in
any
way
an
answer
of
the
enigma
that
an
artist
life
so
frequently
was
utterly
different
from
the
broad
outlines
of
his
work
browning
had
talked
of
a
man
having
two
had
he
two
one
for
the
world
the
other
for
art
and
ferrers
but
then
browning
had
spoken
contemptuously
of
the
one
to
face
the
world
with
surely
games
were
as
good
as
poetry
or
were
they
after
all
he
felt
an
unanswerable
doubt
and
at
such
times
of
introspection
he
would
stop
trying
to
think
and
merely
let
himself
be
carried
on
in
whatever
course
fortune
chose
to
bear
him
and
so
the
jekyll
and
hyde
business
went
on
chapter
vi
the
games
committee
in
the
mud
and
the
rain
the
school
house
two
cock
team
coming
up
early
from
a
puntabout
joined
the
crowd
watching
the
last
stages
of
the
buller
claremont
house
match
and
cheered
claremont
to
the
echo
it
was
a
remarkably
fine
game
when
no
side
was
called
the
score
was
nine
all
extra
time
was
played
and
just
before
the
close
amid
great
enthusiasm
a
limping
claremont
forward
fell
over
the
line
from
the
line
out
none
shouted
louder
than
the
school
house
contingent
everyone
had
grown
tired
of
the
buller
domination
they
had
been
successful
too
long
for
two
years
they
had
not
lost
a
single
house
match
the
thirds
had
been
their
first
reverse
but
even
then
they
had
triumphed
over
all
their
outhouse
opponents
this
was
the
first
occasion
since
gordon
had
been
at
fernhurst
that
the
buller
colours
had
been
lowered
by
an
outhouse
side
it
signified
the
breaking
up
of
their
rule
gordon
shouted
like
the
vengeance
following
the
tumbrils
he
roared
loudly
under
the
bull
nose
stamped
off
the
field
to
tea
without
a
thought
of
the
effect
that
his
demonstration
might
have
had
upon
the
bull
himself
as
it
happened
to
the
bull
the
incident
meant
a
lot
what
is
the
reason
of
it
he
said
to
felston
that
evening
how
have
i
made
these
school
house
men
and
especially
caruthers
hate
me
they
seem
to
delight
in
the
defeat
of
my
house
of
course
i
can
understand
their
wanting
their
house
to
beat
mine
but
why
should
they
worry
so
much
about
claremont
doing
so
i
ca
understand
it
and
caruthers
will
be
leading
the
school
scrum
in
two
years
we
must
not
have
bad
feeling
between
the
houses
honest
rivalry
is
all
right
but
there
seems
so
much
spite
about
it
all
nowadays
it
was
not
so
when
i
was
a
boy
and
it
was
so
three
years
ago
i
do
understand
a
climax
was
reached
in
the
two
cock
a
match
rendered
famous
in
fernhurst
history
by
the
amazing
refereeing
of
a
new
master
named
princeford
who
had
come
as
a
for
one
term
the
match
was
played
in
the
mud
and
slush
and
was
entirely
devoid
of
incident
the
play
rolled
from
one
end
of
the
ground
to
the
other
archie
performed
prodigies
of
valour
gordon
did
some
brilliant
things
collins
was
quite
fierce
but
good
football
was
impossible
under
the
circumstances
early
in
the
first
half
amid
tremendous
cheering
lovelace
scored
a
fine
try
by
the
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
school
lined
up
behind
the
posts
but
princeford
would
have
none
of
it
he
came
up
fussing
and
important
no
try
there
knock
on
scrum
a
gasp
went
up
from
both
sides
was
the
man
blind
what
is
the
fool
talking
about
thundered
gordon
princeford
was
round
in
a
second
who
said
that
gordon
stepped
forward
ah
i
shall
remember
you
the
game
continued
the
outhouses
amazed
at
such
luck
the
school
house
sullen
and
indignant
the
play
developed
into
a
series
of
forward
rushes
resulting
in
nothing
it
was
an
amazingly
dull
game
to
watch
from
one
of
these
rushes
gordon
got
clear
the
fell
on
the
ball
gordon
took
a
huge
kick
at
the
ball
one
had
to
kick
hard
on
such
a
sticky
ground
he
missed
the
ball
and
caught
the
back
on
the
side
of
the
head
oh
damned
sorry
he
said
it
was
quite
unintentional
as
would
have
been
obvious
to
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
the
game
no
one
would
be
fool
enough
to
kick
the
man
when
by
kicking
the
ball
he
might
score
a
try
but
princeford
was
on
gordon
like
a
shot
he
began
to
lecture
him
before
all
the
masters
on
unsportsmanlike
play
and
threatened
to
send
him
off
the
field
gordon
glowered
at
him
it
was
a
combat
of
temperaments
the
game
resulted
in
a
draw
no
try
was
scored
it
was
a
dull
performance
occasionally
relieved
by
individual
brilliance
everyone
was
disappointed
sullen
and
silent
the
house
side
trooped
up
to
tea
they
had
won
the
match
of
that
there
was
no
doubt
and
they
had
been
done
out
of
their
victory
the
limit
was
reached
when
muddy
and
cold
they
found
that
the
new
had
forgotten
to
heat
the
boiler
and
there
was
only
cold
water
to
wash
in
the
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
oaths
and
curses
but
when
the
effects
of
princeford
refereeing
and
the
forgetfulness
had
worn
off
slightly
the
house
felt
more
content
after
all
they
had
not
been
beaten
they
had
got
the
cup
for
half
the
year
at
any
rate
things
might
be
worse
and
when
in
hall
that
night
hazelton
gave
him
his
house
cap
all
gordon
rage
was
overwhelmed
by
the
feeling
that
his
dearest
object
had
been
achieved
the
was
forgiven
princeford
faded
into
the
background
of
insignificance
from
which
he
had
temporarily
emerged
but
the
matter
did
not
end
there
other
fingers
were
itching
to
be
in
the
pie
christy
and
rogers
walking
up
from
the
field
together
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
incorrigible
nuisance
caruthers
had
disgraced
fernhurst
football
princeford
was
a
master
from
sedbury
he
had
only
come
for
one
term
as
a
special
concession
because
his
headmaster
was
a
great
friend
of
the
chief
what
sort
of
an
impression
would
he
carry
away
of

manners
and
sportsmanship
if
caruthers
should
be
allowed
to
go
unpunished
not
only
for
playing
a
deliberately
foul
game
but
also
for
using
most
foul
language
and
so
these
two
neither
of
whom
knew
anything
about
football
while
both
were
immensely
aware
of
their
own
importance
made
their
way
to
the
bull
study
to
pour
out
their
grievances
the
bull
was
laid
up
with
influenza
and
had
been
prevented
from
watching
the
match
they
found
him
lying
on
his
sofa
for
over
an
hour
they
elaborated
the
tale
of
gordon
misconduct
they
pointed
out
that
the
object
of
house
matches
was
to
promote
a
keenness
in
school
football
and
to
provide
interest
for
those
who
were
not
good
enough
to
get
into
the
school
team
the
school
house
had
for
years
during
the
easter
term
isolated
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
school
it
had
considered
itself
as
apart
a
school
in
itself
such
an
attitude
militated
against
de
it
made
the
house
appear
more
important
than
the
school
it
led
to
bad
feeling
between
houses
in
caruthers
were
developed
all
the
worst
faults
of
this
system
his
keenness
for
his
house
had
so
far
drowned
his
affection
for
his
school
that
he
used
any
tactics
to
reach
his
end
he
took
defeat
in
an
unsportsmanlike
manner
this
afternoon
play
had
made
this
clear
and
what
was
worst
of
all
was
that
caruthers
had
a
sufficient
personality
to
attract
others
moths
are
always
attracted
by
the
flame
said
rogers
pompously
if
caruthers
were
dealt
with
effectively
at
once
this
poisonous
school
house
notion
of
its
own
importance
would
collapse
was
it
going
to
be
put
an
end
to
that
was
the
question
they
put
to
mr
buller
and
they
took
over
an
hour
in
putting
it
the
bull
listened
to
all
they
had
to
say
and
as
soon
as
they
began
repeating
themselves
and
he
realised
they
had
given
all
the
information
they
could
told
them
he
had
now
to
dress
for
dinner
but
that
he
would
consider
the
matter
carefully
and
let
them
know
his
opinion
later
on
like
two
obsequious
courtiers
before
an
eastern
monarch
rogers
and
christy
bowed
themselves
out
inarticulate
with
advice
and
last
words
the
bull
smiled
he
was
too
big
a
man
to
be
taken
in
by
such
obvious
hypocrisy
these
men
amused
him
greatly
especially
because
they
both
thought
he
took
them
seriously
but
for
all
that
he
saw
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
what
they
had
said
he
wished
he
had
been
at
the
game
himself
it
was
so
hard
to
form
an
estimate
on
the
strength
of
partial
onlookers
princeford
refereeing
might
have
been
exasperating
but
damn
it
even
if
it
had
a
sportsman
should
not
make
a
fuss
about
it
it
was
all
part
of
the
game
but
caruthers
did
not
treat
a
house
match
as
a
game
but
as
the
real
business
of
life
that
was
what
rankled
caruthers
would
laugh
when
he
dropped
a
catch
in
a
colts
match
or
missed
his
collar
on
the
upper
but
in
a
house
match
his
face
would
be
set
his
eyes
wide
and
eager
humour
had
for
the
moment
ceased
to
exist
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
clearly
preferred
his
house
to
his
school
was
he
stirring
up
any
feeling
between
the
outhouses
and
the
school
house
he
remembered
an
occasion
terms
back
when
gordon
in
a
house
game
had
shouted
out
let
the
swine
have
it
then
again
there
was
that
affair
of
bribing
burgoyne
to
lay
out
one
of
his
men
and
then
the
incident
this
afternoon
outwardly
he
was
doing
his
very
best
to
separate
the
interests
of
his
house
from
those
of
the
school
to
split
fernhurst
into
two
factions
but
supposing
after
all
these
were
merely
outward
signs
supposing
gordon
excessive
keenness
coupled
with
the
rash
hotheadedness
of
youth
led
him
where
his
cooler
judgment
would
have
checked
him
if
that
were
so
and
if
strong
measures
were
taken
might
not
his
keenness
change
into
a
hatred
of
fernhurst
might
it
not
lead
him
to
open
antagonism
with
the
rest
of
the
school
punishment
might
merely
inflame
and
not
crush
him
while
if
his
feelings
were
only
the
natural
effervescence
of
youth
they
would
wear
down
in
time
and
then
all
would
be
well
yet
he
realised
that
it
is
the
things
which
show
that
count
in
this
world
a
man
is
judged
not
by
what
he
is
but
by
what
he
appears
to
be
everything
pointed
to
the
belief
that
gordon
was
working
against
the
interests
of
fernhurst
whether
he
actually
meant
to
do
so
or
not
was
immaterial
he
had
to
be
dealt
with
as
if
it
was
deliberate
it
might
be
hard
on
him
but
it
was
not
the
interests
of
the
individual
but
of
the
community
that
had
to
be
considered
the
bull
sent
for
akerman
the
school
captain
after
chapel
on
sunday
morning
akerman
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
caruther
behaviour
in
the
two
cock
yesterday
afternoon
of
course
i
did
not
see
what
happened
but
from
what
i
have
heard
i
think
measures
ought
to
be
taken
it
is
a
serious
matter
light
measures
are
no
good
i
know
caruthers
you
have
got
to
crush
him
or
he
will
laugh
at
you
i
think
what
is
required
is
a
thrashing
from
the
games
committee
he
is
bound
to
be
awed
by
the
disapproval
of
a
body
representing
fernhurst
football
i
suppose
now
that
the
games
committee
would
raise
any
objection
what
about
hazelton
well
sir
hazelton
went
to
the
matron
last
night
and
they
discovered
he
had
got
mumps
i
just
passed
him
on
the
way
to
the
sanatorium
um
that
means
there
is
no
school
house
representative
there
must
be
one
it
would
not
do
for
it
to
appear
a
school
thing
got
up
against
a
school
house
boy
it
would
only
help
to
alienate
the
two
parties
still
more
let
see
who
is
the
next
senior
man
in
the
school
house
pilcher
sir
pilcher
was
one
of
those
people
who
though
quite
efficient
at
everything
he
was
in
the
upper
sixth
pass
through
the
school
without
leaving
any
mark
behind
them
he
was
outside
and
was
well
worth
his
place
in
the
side
but
he
was
in
no
way
a
blood
he
was
never
seen
he
was
always
in
his
study
his
was
a
blameless
uneventful
career
he
wo
raise
any
objection
will
he
i
should
think
so
sir
akerman
had
difficulty
in
not
smiling
very
well
then
you
had
better
call
a
meeting
of
the
games
committee
this
afternoon
and
talk
over
the
matter
if
anyone
makes
a
fuss
say
i
agree
with
it
and
i
expect
it
will
be
all
right
there
was
no
need
however
for
any
recourse
to
the
oracle
the
games
committee
consisted
of
the
captains
of
each
house
none
of
them
cared
the
least
what
happened
to
caruthers
he
was
nothing
to
them
pilcher
supposed
it
was
all
right
the
grand
remonstrance
was
passed
on
monday
at
gordon
was
summoned
by
a
fag
to
attend
in
the
school
library
the
six
members
of
the
games
committee
sat
around
a
circular
table
on
which
lay
two
canes
it
all
looked
very
impressive
akerman
rose
he
began
to
read
a
speech
off
a
piece
of
school
paper
gordon
had
wondered
why
he
had
been
so
very
energetic
in
taking
down
notes
during
the
chief
divinity
lecture
that
morning
the
speech
went
on
it
was
full
of
the
inevitable
platitudes
about
de
and
a
sportsmanlike
spirit
now
and
then
akerman
stumbled
and
had
some
difficulty
in
reading
his
own
writing
if
there
had
not
hung
over
him
the
prospect
of
a
very
severe
beating
gordon
would
have
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
akerman
was
so
pricelessly
absurd
the
rest
looked
painfully
why
could
not
akerman
have
learnt
his
speech
it
was
so
bad
that
he
could
not
imagine
anyone
having
any
difficulty
in
making
it
up
as
he
went
along
akerman
was
afraid
of
expressing
an
opinion
he
prefaced
every
remark
with
mr
buller
says
it
gave
a
sense
of
security
the
speech
ended
everyone
except
gordon
was
relieved
bend
over
there
the
beating
was
not
so
horrible
an
ordeal
as
he
had
expected
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
the
outhouse
captains
had
raised
no
objection
merely
because
they
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
happened
to
gordon
so
now
they
did
not
take
any
particular
trouble
to
hurt
him
the
ordeal
was
rather
a
fiasco
a
halting
oration
had
led
to
an
even
tamer
execution
as
gordon
walked
down
the
library
steps
he
was
painfully
aware
of
having
been
the
principal
character
in
a
scene
of
sustained
bathos
the
body
that
represented
fernhurst
football
had
scarcely
risen
to
the
dignity
of
its
trust
and
then
a
sudden
wave
of
feeling
swept
over
him
and
he
saw
the
horrible
unfairness
of
the
whole
thing
it
did
not
matter
that
akerman
had
made
himself
utterly
ludicrous
or
that
the
rest
of
the
games
committee
had
been
led
to
carry
out
a
programme
which
they
knew
to
be
hypocritical
it
was
the
spirit
that
mattered
and
at
the
back
of
it
all
moved
the
bull
pulling
the
strings
in
front
of
the
school
house
porch
clearly
dispassionately
gordon
put
his
case
i
know
when
i
play
football
i
get
a
bit
excited
i
know
my
feet
fly
all
over
the
place
they
did
that
ever
since
i
was
a
baby
i
know
i
sometimes
lose
my
temper
but
i
have
been
like
that
always
i
have
played
the
same
game
in
the
thirds
and
in
the
colts
my
first
term
and
yesterday
but
nobody
said
anything
then
do
you
remember
the
milton
match
i
went
a
bit
far
then
i
was
fearfully
ashamed
of
myself
afterwards
i
thought
my
play
had
been
a
disgrace
to
the
school
but
did
bull
think
so
good
lord
no
he
gave
the
side
a
jaw
and
said
that
they
were
a
disgrace
to
the
school
with
the
exception
of
me
i
played
hard
and
all
that
while
the
rest
slacked
and
funked
i
was
singled
out
for
praise
in
the
roughest
game
i
have
ever
played
and
now
what
happens
the
house
begins
to
win
its
matches
bull
sees
his
house
losing
cup
after
cup
he
and
akerman
and
the
other
fools
think
something
must
be
done
so
they
wait
for
an
opportunity
and
then
give
me
a
games
committee
beating
to
try
and
frighten
the
rest
of
the
house
they
talked
about
my
unsportsmanlike
play
they
did
not
mind
when
i
played
rough
against
milton
oh
dear
no
but
when
they
find
their
own
dirty
shins
being
hacked
they
sit
up
and
shriek
and
they
wait
till
hazelton
stops
out
too
everyone
agreed
with
him
from
dan
to
beersheba
there
was
but
one
opinion
buller
had
not
been
playing
the
game
the
authorities
were
against
them
the
house
would
have
to
cling
together
to
protect
its
rights
they
could
not
have
buller
trampling
on
them
dictating
terms
he
had
begun
the
contest
they
would
be
prepared
for
him
next
time
an
aura
of
antagonism
overhung
the
grey
studies
members
of
buller
house
were
dealt
with
in
the
sweeping
delineation
of
the
swine
across
the
road
for
the
rest
of
the
term
every
time
princeford
passed
the
school
house
on
his
way
to
the
common
room
a
whistle
blew
from
the
dark
recesses
of
the
studies
and
some
voice
shouted
no
try
the
bull
himself
was
looked
on
with
a
general
suspicion
the
inevitable
had
happened
the
bull
in
his
attempt
to
sacrifice
the
individual
to
the
community
had
forgotten
that
the
community
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
individual
the
world
is
composed
of
a
number
of
individuals
round
whom
parties
and
nations
cling
the
bull
had
made
an
attack
on
the
individual
and
the
community
that
gordon
represented
took
up
his
attitude
of
defiance
strengthening
his
resolve
not
to
give
way
to
keep
the
house
independent
of
the
tyranny
that
drew
five
outhouses
together
as
one
the
house
was
not
to
be
coerced
its
members
would
be
free
to
think
to
do
to
speak
as
they
thought
best
from
that
moment
gordon
took
the
interests
of
the
house
and
not
fernhurst
as
the
standard
by
which
to
judge
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
and
so
it
happened
that
just
at
this
moment
when
the
house
was
bubbling
over
with
suppressed
wrath
a
chance
was
given
them
of
showing
their
independence
and
defiance
chapter
vii
rebellion
on
the
wednesday
after
the
games
committee
activities
in
the
library
ferrers
banged
into
betteridge
study
his
arms
laden
with
books
there
was
a
stoics
meeting
on
the
next
saturday
and
the
card
drawn
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
announced
that
there
would
be
a
reading
of
and
the
by
bernard
shaw
but
ferrers
who
was
now
president
never
took
any
notice
of
the
programme
which
he
invariably
altered
a
day
or
two
before
the
meeting
this
imposed
a
considerable
strain
on
those
who
had
to
get
up
fresh
parts
and
prepare
different
speeches
at
a
notice
but
as
the
alterations
were
nearly
always
an
improvement
no
one
minded
sorry
betteridge
had
to
change
stoics
thing
just
picked
up
this
by
stanley
houghton
ordered
fifteen
copies
from
sidgwick
jackson
good
publishers
do
you
know
them
i
marked
our
parts
here
they
are
no
more
time
he
was
gone
in
a
second
and
the
unfortunate
secretary
was
left
with
the
lot
of
distributing
copies
and
drawing
up
fresh
notices
it
was
just
on
so
there
was
no
time
to
do
anything
till
the
next
day
he
settled
himself
down
to
read
the
play
in
a
very
short
while
he
was
thoroughly
engrossed
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
first
act
he
had
no
doubt
that
saturday
would
witness
the
most
successful
meeting
of
the
stoics
since
the
historic
occasion
when
macdonald
and
rogers
had
been
persuaded
to
speak
on
opposite
sides
on
trade
unionism
and
rogers
had
been
most
gloriously
routed
betteridge
went
in
search
of
tester
and
gordon
come
up
to
my
study
and
read
a
play
ferrers
has
got
hold
of
for
the
stoics
it
glorious
stuff
all
right
said
gordon
i
will
go
and
fetch
rudd
for
god
sake
do
bring
that
outsider
oh
hell
why
not
he
is
quite
respectable
and
after
all
he
is
one
of
the
best
of
our
regular
readers
all
right
then
fetch
him
along
since
their
scandalous
ramble
gordon
had
become
more
or
less
friends
with
rudd
and
had
to
a
large
extent
helped
to
make
his
life
more
bearable
the
four
sat
silent
reading
the
play
there
was
occasionally
a
suppressed
laugh
otherwise
no
one
spoke
at
all
in
under
an
hour
they
had
all
finished
jolly
good
said
gordon
i
do
like
seeing
this
younger
generation
up
against
the
rotten
conventions
of
the
era
deal
gently
with
them
murmured
betteridge
their
horsehair
have
stood
the
test
of
time
very
well
too
well
but
their
puritan
ideas
are
in
the
now
their
day
is
over
you
know
i
am
not
sure
that
the
stoics
is
the
right
audience
for
a
play
like
this
said
tester
good
heavens
man
protested
gordon
you
do
think
it
would
corrupt
their
morals
do
you
of
course
not
you
ass
i
do
think
they
would
understand
it
all
they
will
laugh
at
it
and
think
it
funny
but
they
wo
really
see
what
houghton
is
driving
at
they
wo
understand
that
he
is
trying
to
cut
away
the
shackles
of
mature
thought
that
are
impeding
the
limbs
of
youth
the
lads
in
the
remove
will
be
frightfully
amused
they
will
think
the
father
an
awful
old
fool
and
the
son
the
devil
of
a
rip
they
wo
see
that
both
of
them
are
real
characters
and
that
a
hundred
families
are
working
out
their
own
little
tragedy
just
on
these
very
lines
but
surely
there
are
really
no
fathers
quite
so
absurd
as
old
kennion
does
not
houghton
exaggerate
the
type
as
dickens
exaggerates
all
his
types
oh
no
he
real
enough
i
expect
there
are
a
good
many
like
him
living
in
fernhurst
now
the
truth
of
the
last
remark
was
brought
home
three
days
later
on
the
friday
before
the
debate
ferrers
got
a
bad
attack
of
influenza
there
would
be
no
one
to
take
the
chair
moved
by
an
instinct
of
courtesy
ferrers
wrote
to
christy
a
little
note
enclosing
the
book
and
asking
him
to
preside
on
saturday
morning
christy
went
up
to
betteridge
in
break
ah
betteridge
mr
ferrers
has
asked
me
to
take
the
chair
at
the
stoics
well
i
myself
would
not
be
present
when
such
a
play
was
read
it
is
aimed
at
the
very
roots
of
domestic
morality
it
might
do
very
well
in
a
small
circle
of
senior
boys
but
it
would
have
a
very
serious
effect
on
young
boys
who
are
not
as
mature
as
you
or
i
are
none
of
my
house
will
attend
and
from
a
conversation
i
had
with
mr
rogers
and
mr
claremont
i
am
fairly
certain
they
will
not
allow
their
houses
to
go
either
it
would
be
really
much
better
to
wait
until
mr
ferrers
is
well
again
before
anything
is
done
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
postpone
the
meeting
i
suppose
oh
yes
sir
of
course
betteridge
was
not
paying
much
attention
he
was
thinking
hard
the
bell
for
school
rang
that
will
be
all
right
then
betteridge
quite
thank
you
sir
christy
bubbling
with
satisfaction
rushed
off
to
tell
the
head
of
buller
that
the
meeting
had
been
postponed
things
were
turning
out
well
for
him
he
had
obtained
the
beating
of
caruthers
and
now
he
had
most
distinctly
scored
off
ferrers
he
did
not
stop
to
think
that
both
these
campaigns
had
been
carried
on
behind
his
enemy
back
but
in
his
moment
of
triumph
over
ferrers
he
did
not
pause
to
think
whether
he
had
also
triumphed
over
the
school
house
spirit
of
antagonism
which
he
himself
had
stirred
up
during
the
between
morning
school
and
lunch
betteridge
tester
and
gordon
held
a
council
of
war
of
course
whatever
we
do
said
betteridge
is
bound
to
be
in
the
nature
of
farce
three
houses
you
see
wo
turn
up
at
all
abercrombie
hardly
ever
sends
anyone
and
i
do
mind
betting
that
christy
gets
round
bull
somehow
yes
but
confound
it
all
said
gordon
are
we
going
to
be
dictated
to
by
these
outhouse
potentates
the
stoics
is
more
a
school
house
society
than
anything
else
and
what
more
it
is
going
to
remain
so
these
outhouse
men
can
come
or
go
if
they
want
to
it
does
not
matter
to
us
let
us
read
this
play
with
a
school
house
cast
carry
the
thing
through
somehow
and
show
these
fools
like
christy
what
we
think
of
them
now
is
our
chance
of
proving
our
independence
wo
there
be
a
hell
of
a
row
though
said
betteridge
reluctantly
what
if
there
is
man
said
gordon
we
ca
help
that
somehow
or
other
that
play
is
going
to
be
read
let
this
evening
be
a
symbol
of
the
house
attitude
these
houses
have
flung
down
the
glove
they
beat
our
forwards
when
we
win
matches
and
they
try
and
stop
our
meetings
damn
it
we
pick
up
the
glove
yes
shouted
gordon
and
fling
it
in
their
snivelling
faces
betteridge
drew
up
a
huge
notice
of
the
meeting
after
hall
and
posted
it
on
the
school
board
it
ran
as
follows
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
many
of
the
usual
readers
will
be
prevented
from
attending
the
second
meeting
of
the
stoics
this
term
the
society
will
read
at
in
the
school
house
reading
room
younger
by
stanley
houghton
cast
betteridge
that
evening
was
historic
every
member
of
the
school
house
attended
the
meeting
the
members
of
the
as
well
as
those
from
the
studies
the
was
packed
it
was
a
record
meeting
the
reading
was
erratic
parts
were
forced
at
the
eleventh
hour
on
reluctant
and
totally
unsuitable
persons
but
somehow
or
other
they
got
through
it
in
the
end
and
that
was
all
that
mattered
but
still
it
was
not
without
a
little
nervousness
that
the
conspirators
awaited
developments
christy
saw
the
notice
and
fumed
ferrers
heard
of
it
and
laughed
rogers
rushed
to
the
chief
palpitating
with
rage
after
lunch
the
chief
sent
for
betteridge
and
asked
for
a
copy
of
younger
there
was
an
air
of
nervous
anticipation
pervading
the
studies
just
before
tea
the
chief
sent
for
betteridge
again
a
very
interesting
play
very
modern
of
course
but
extremely
clever
thank
you
so
much
for
lending
it
me
i
wish
i
had
been
at
the
reading
a
record
attendance
i
hear
well
ask
me
to
come
next
time
you
get
as
good
a
play
as
that
there
was
no
reference
to
the
outhouse
boycott
the
chief
was
very
tactful
and
moreover
he
had
enjoyed
reading
the
play
immensely
besides
it
would
not
have
done
any
good
if
he
had
made
a
fuss
especially
when
he
was
entirely
in
sympathy
with
betteridge
in
fernhurst
school
which
was
edited
by
betteridge
there
appeared
the
following
paragraph
on
saturday
march
before
a
record
and
appreciative
audience
the
stoics
read
younger
by
stanley
houghton
there
was
no
one
who
failed
to
realise
the
extraordinary
insight
into
the
life
of
the
day
that
made
such
a
work
possible
the
enthusiasm
and
applause
were
highly
significant
as
showing
what
a
keen
interest
the
school
is
taking
in
all
questions
of
social
and
domestic
life
there
were
rather
fewer
representatives
from
the
outhouses
than
usual
but
this
was
as
well
as
there
would
have
been
little
room
for
them
the
victory
of
christy
was
not
so
very
complete
after
all
with
this
successful
demonstration
gordon
excitement
in
house
politics
abated
chapter
viii
the
dawning
of
many
dreams
the
three
cock
came
and
went
bringing
with
it
house
caps
for
lovelace
collins
and
fletcher
but
it
caused
little
stir
everyone
had
foreseen
the
result
and
without
hazelton
ill
with
mumps
the
house
stood
little
chance
of
keeping
the
score
under
fifty
hostilities
were
declared
closed
for
the
time
being
the
four
weeks
of
training
for
the
sports
came
on
and
gordon
sixth
form
privileges
were
restored
for
a
short
time
the
hold
of
athleticism
was
weakened
and
as
it
weakened
the
hold
of
literature
became
more
firm
house
caps
were
always
allowed
a
fairly
slack
time
after
the
three
cock
and
gordon
made
the
best
of
his
while
the
last
traces
of
winter
were
disappearing
and
the
evenings
began
to
draw
out
into
long
lingering
sunsets
he
voyaged
on
into
the
unknown
waters
of
poetry
keats
and
shelley
names
which
had
once
meant
nothing
to
him
now
became
his
living
prophets
he
felt
his
own
life
coloured
by
their
interpretations
during
the
days
of
his
quest
for
power
when
the
scent
of
battle
had
led
him
on
he
had
found
inspiration
only
in
those
whose
moods
coincided
with
his
own
but
now
that
the
contest
was
over
and
strife
was
merged
into
a
temporary
lull
there
came
a
check
in
the
fiery
search
for
achievements
he
found
pleasure
in
the
gentler
but
far
more
beautiful
melodies
of
keats
byron
and
swinburne
had
beaten
so
loudly
on
their
drums
and
blown
so
forcibly
on
the
clarion
that
his
ears
had
been
deafened
but
in
the
peaceful
afterglow
of
satisfied
desire
he
asked
for
soft
and
quiet
music
during
this
time
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
ferrers
together
they
discussed
all
the
questions
that
to
them
seemed
most
vital
the
public
school
system
came
in
for
a
great
deal
of
abuse
a
lot
wants
altering
ferrers
said
boys
come
here
fresh
from
preparatory
schools
if
they
are
clever
and
get
into
higher
forms
they
are
put
among
bigger
boys
and
they
get
their
outlook
coloured
by
them
they
get
wrong
impressions
shoved
into
their
heads
cease
to
think
at
all
lose
all
sense
of
honesty
and
morality
then
the
school
that
has
made
them
like
this
finds
out
what
they
are
and
sends
them
away
by
jove
that
just
what
jeffries
said
jeffries
who
is
jeffries
i
do
know
him
he
was
a
splendid
fellow
but
like
most
other
people
he
followed
the
crowd
then
got
caught
and
had
to
go
that
is
it
always
the
same
usually
the
least
bad
are
sacked
too
never
heard
of
a
real
rake
getting
sent
away
the
rakes
are
far
too
clever
cleverness
is
what
counts
counts
all
through
life
a
man
is
expelled
only
because
he
is
not
clever
enough
to
avoid
being
caught
and
then
the
school
thinks
it
saving
the
others
by
sending
him
away
and
it
does
no
good
the
big
wrong
stays
on
only
the
weak
one
goes
human
nature
is
a
thing
that
has
got
to
be
dealt
with
carefully
not
in
the
way
it
is
here
ferrers
wrote
a
great
deal
about
public
schools
to
the
various
london
papers
he
was
fast
winning
a
name
in
the
educational
world
but
he
was
always
being
asked
to
modify
his
statements
he
raved
against
the
weakness
of
the
authorities
they
do
want
to
know
the
truth
he
said
they
are
afraid
to
hear
it
us
lies
that
what
they
say
us
into
a
false
security
a
big
is
coming
soon
but
keep
it
off
till
after
we
are
gone
they
know
their
house
is
built
on
sand
running
out
into
the
river
they
want
to
barricade
their
own
tiny
houses
for
a
little
i
want
to
go
and
search
for
the
big
firm
land
but
they
are
too
comfortable
on
their
cushions
and
fine
linen
to
dare
to
move
oh
prophesy
smooth
things
gordon
listened
intently
to
it
all
ferrers
was
his
ideal
often
they
would
talk
of
books
of
the
modern
novel
of
compton
mackenzie
in
whom
idealism
and
realism
were
one
of
rupert
brooke
the
coming
poet
who
was
to
make
men
believe
in
the
beauties
of
this
earth
instead
of
hankering
after
an
immaterial
hereafter
of
the
elizabethan
drama
of
marlowe
beaumont
webster
they
were
very
wonderful
those
hours
gordon
felt
that
he
had
at
last
after
wandering
far
come
to
his
continuing
city
glancing
back
over
his
last
two
years
he
used
to
laugh
and
say
i
do
regret
them
i
was
happy
and
the
only
thing
to
regret
is
unhappiness
but
i
have
outgrown
them
they
did
not
last
they
were
what
stephen
phillips
would
number
among
the
quick
fading
things
they
were
good
days
though
but
i
am
happier
now
i
can
see
the
future
spreading
out
before
me
next
winter
hunter
will
be
captain
but
i
shall
be
second
in
the
team
and
lead
the
forwards
it
will
be
a
year
of
preparation
then
will
come
my
year
of
captaincy
all
the
things
i
wanted
seem
falling
into
my
hands
is
sweet
brother
life
is
sweet
and
looking
back
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
wild
orgy
of
pack
monday
fair
he
had
finally
burnt
the
old
garments
and
put
on
the
new
that
day
had
been
the
funeral
pyre
of
his
old
life
and
like
sardanapalus
it
had
died
of
its
own
free
will
a
glorious
end
no
but
the
future
was
still
more
glorious
when
he
watched
the
morning
sun
flicker
white
on
the
broad
eversham
road
from
the
station
to
the
abbey
the
leaves
breaking
on
the
lindens
the
dim
lights
waking
in
the
chapel
on
sunday
he
saw
how
far
he
had
outgrown
his
old
self
now
he
had
begun
to
perceive
what
life
aim
should
be
the
search
for
beauty
tester
had
been
right
when
he
said
that
beauty
was
the
only
thing
worth
having
the
one
ideal
time
could
not
tarnish
and
yet
tester
was
not
satisfied
the
hold
of
the
world
was
too
strong
on
him
he
could
see
where
others
were
going
wrong
but
he
himself
was
all
astray
at
times
morbidly
wretched
at
others
hilarious
with
excitement
it
was
merely
a
question
of
temperament
gordon
saw
stretching
before
him
the
fulfilment
of
his
hopes
there
was
no
niche
for
failure
his
destiny
would
unroll
smoothly
like
a
great
machine
he
was
at
peace
in
sympathy
with
a
world
of
beautiful
ideas
and
dreams
at
times
he
would
feel
an
unreasoning
anger
with
the
public
school
system
but
his
rage
soon
cooled
down
after
all
it
had
left
him
at
the
last
unscathed
and
was
in
the
future
to
bring
many
gifts
others
might
be
broken
on
the
wheel
but
he
was
still
sufficiently
an
egoist
sufficiently
to
be
indifferent
to
them
he
had
come
through
with
luck
perhaps
but
still
he
had
come
through
that
was
all
that
mattered
he
had
not
read
matthew
if
he
had
he
might
have
recognised
himself
in
the
pilgrim
who
had
saved
only
himself
while
the
world
was
full
of
others
like
the
chief
who
were
bringing
their
sheep
in
their
hand
but
probably
even
if
he
had
read
the
poem
at
that
time
he
would
have
been
too
happy
too
too
successful
to
realise
its
poignant
truth
and
it
would
not
have
been
surprising
youth
is
always
intolerant
and
it
is
only
when
we
grow
old
and
see
so
little
done
of
all
we
so
gaily
set
out
to
do
that
we
suddenly
appreciate
that
even
if
we
have
ourselves
failed
yet
if
we
can
by
our
experience
help
someone
else
to
succeed
our
life
will
not
be
utterly
vain
altruism
is
the
philosophy
of
middle
age
on
a
few
but
very
few
occasions
gordon
was
temporarily
roused
out
of
his
secure
atmosphere
one
of
these
was
on
the
last
day
of
term
when
a
letter
appeared
in
fernhurst
school
suggesting
that
the
three
cock
should
be
changed
into
a
two
cock
since
the
school
house
had
for
the
last
few
years
proved
itself
so
incapable
of
holding
out
against
the
strong
outhouse
combination
of
three
houses
against
one
much
of
what
the
writer
said
was
true
the
house
numbered
only
about
seventy
while
each
outhouse
contained
some
forty
boys
with
perhaps
six
day
boys
attached
to
each
the
house
did
not
take
in
day
boys
so
that
the
house
was
always
playing
against
a
selection
from
double
its
number
a
two
cock
would
be
far
fairer
nevertheless
the
house
was
furious
confounded
old
ass
said
mansell
i
believe
claremont
wrote
it
let
him
wait
till
next
year
and
he
will
see
his
beastly
blue
shirts
rolled
in
the
mud
but
it
is
such
infernal
swank
said
gordon
we
smashed
them
in
the
thirds
to
all
intents
and
purposes
we
routed
them
in
the
two
cock
the
only
thing
the
outhouses
won
was
the
three
cock
and
they
are
so
bucked
about
that
that
they
want
to
clinch
a
victory
get
up
and
shout
at
us
what
devils
of
fine
fellows
we
are
you
ca
touch
us
better
take
charity
unutterable
conceit
why
we
won
four
times
running
about
seven
years
ago
i
have
a
good
mind
to
go
to
claremont
and
give
it
him
straight
betteridge
you
absurd
ass
why
did
you
print
this
thing
well
you
see
there
were
a
few
rather
risky
things
in
the
paper
and
i
thought
if
i
cut
it
out
he
might
hack
about
the
rest
of
the
rag
and
besides
it
will
be
an
awful
score
when
we
win
next
year
as
we
are
absolutely
certain
to
ca
you
imagine
the
account
year
some
rather
foolhardy
persons
doubted
the
ability
of
the
school
house
to
deal
with
a
combined
side
of
the
best
three
outhouses
and
they
were
rash
enough
to
express
their
doubts
in
print
but
this
year
under
the
able
captaincy
of
hunter
with
the
forwards
admirably
led
by
caruthers
the
house
gained
a
thoroughly
deserved
victory
by
fifteen
points
to
three
we
shall
crow
then
my
lads
we
yes
it
will
be
all
right
then
said
mansell
my
lord
i
wish
i
was
going
to
be
here
to
play
in
it
my
governor
is
a
fool
to
make
me
leave
and
go
to
france
mansell
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
term
well
all
the
same
it
a
vile
insult
to
the
house
said
gordon
whether
he
meant
it
or
not
it
an
insult
but
his
annoyance
passed
quickly
he
was
far
too
certain
of
the
future
to
worry
much
about
what
anyone
said
he
was
sure
the
house
would
win
in
the
end
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
when
the
came
his
anger
gave
way
to
pride
his
place
in
form
gave
him
little
satisfaction
for
he
was
easily
bottom
of
the
sixth
but
after
the
books
had
been
given
there
came
the
turn
of
the
house
cups
amid
enormous
cheers
lovelace
went
up
for
the
thirds
cup
amid
still
louder
cheers
he
and
the
outhouse
captain
stepped
up
together
to
receive
the
two
cock
cup
then
at
tea
hazelton
walked
into
hall
carrying
the
two
trophies
to
place
on
the
mantelpiece
and
the
house
burst
forth
in
a
roar
of
cheering
it
was
all
sheer
joy
and
beyond
the
present
glory
shone
the
dawn
of
great
triumphs
to
come
the
house
was
just
entering
on
its
career
of
success
the
day
of
buller
was
at
an
end
there
only
remained
to
them
the
remnants
of
their
earlier
glory
where
they
had
stood
the
house
was
about
to
stand
and
in
that
hour
of
triumph
gordon
himself
would
be
the
protagonist
the
short
easter
holidays
passed
happily
over
the
fresh
grass
of
hampstead
heath
gordon
wandered
alone
on
those
april
mornings
when
the
trees
were
breaking
into
a
green
splendour
when
the
long
waters
of
the
welsh
harp
lay
out
in
the
morning
sun
like
a
sheet
of
gold
looking
across
from
the
firs
he
saw
the
spire
of
harrow
church
cutting
the
red
sky
and
the
long
stretch
of
country
in
between
rolling
out
into
a
panorama
of
loveliness
on
the
road
to
parliament
hill
he
passed
the
spot
where
shelley
found
a
starving
woman
dying
in
the
snow
and
took
her
to
leigh
hunt
house
to
give
her
warmth
near
john
house
was
the
garden
where
keats
had
written
his
immortal
to
a
hampstead
was
prodigal
of
associations
and
they
stirred
the
boy
imagination
like
a
trumpet
call
then
followed
the
long
summer
term
with
its
drowsy
afternoons
its
white
flannels
its
long
evening
shadows
creeping
across
the
courts
its
ices
its
innumerable
lemonades
everything
conspired
to
make
gordon
supremely
happy
scholastically
he
had
at
last
achieved
his
great
wish
of
specialising
in
history
a
programme
which
actually
implied
that
he
would
not
need
to
do
another
stroke
of
work
during
his
fernhurst
career
specialising
in
history
was
an
elastic
activity
and
might
mean
a
few
hours
a
week
in
which
to
read
up
political
economy
it
might
mean
what
prothero
made
it
mean
seven
hours
in
school
a
week
and
the
remainder
pretending
to
read
history
in
his
study
the
grey
and
lifeless
finnemore
superintended
the
history
and
like
everything
else
he
superintended
it
was
scandalously
neglected
outhouse
people
occasionally
did
a
little
work
school
house
men
never
gordon
began
by
taking
quite
modest
privileges
he
knew
he
had
heaps
of
time
to
enlarge
his
advantages
he
started
by
doing
one
prose
and
one
con
a
week
instead
of
two
proses
and
two
cons
like
the
rest
of
the
form
he
also
gave
up
one
latin
construe
book
and
one
greek
book
that
meant
about
two
hours
a
day
to
idle
in
his
study
but
he
found
it
quite
easy
to
turn
that
two
into
three
and
he
was
well
aware
that
by
christmas
his
daily
hours
of
indolence
would
have
reached
five
prothero
at
the
present
moment
was
only
going
into
school
for
divinity
and
french
and
as
often
as
not
he
told
his
french
master
that
he
was
so
much
occupied
with
history
that
he
could
not
come
to
french
at
all
nominally
he
went
into
school
seven
hours
a
week
actually
he
very
rarely
went
in
more
than
three
the
method
of
teaching
history
at
fernhurst
had
been
the
same
from
time
immemorial
gordon
was
told
to
buy
by
lodge
price
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
he
did
not
however
put
his
father
to
this
expense
history
specialists
in
the
school
house
had
for
years
used
the
same
book
it
had
once
belonged
to
a
fabulous
van
hepworth
who
had
gained
a
history
exhibition
at
selwyn
somewhere
in
the
nineties
no
one
knew
anything
of
this
van
hepworth
his
name
was
on
the
school
boards
but
he
had
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
he
had
left
fernhurst
for
the
romantic
atmosphere
of
cambridge
but
he
had
left
behind
him
a
name
that
will
be
remembered
in
the
school
house
as
long
as
history
is
taught
by
finnemore
for
on
his
last
day
in
a
fit
of
gratitude
he
had
left
to
future
historians
the
legacy
of
his
history
notebook
it
contained
all
that
finnemore
knew
every
week
finnemore
set
three
questions
to
his
specialists
to
be
done
with
books
he
had
a
stock
of
these
questions
and
van
hepworth
had
written
exhaustive
essays
on
every
one
of
them
all
that
was
needed
was
to
consult
the
oracle
and
then
copy
out
what
he
had
written
sometimes
by
way
of
a
change
finnemore
would
think
of
a
new
subject
but
gordon
would
say
oh
sir
i
have
been
reading
about
mary
de
medici
and
am
very
much
interested
in
her
i
wondered
if
i
could
do
a
question
on
her
of
course
i
always
like
you
to
do
what
you
are
interested
in
let
me
see
i
have
a
nice
little
question
on
her
de
medici
was
she
an
unmixed
evil
an
interesting
subject
which
raises
quite
a
lot
of
points
and
i
have
one
more
question
for
you
richelieu
and
mazarin
an
interesting
little
psychological
study
i
think
you
will
enjoy
them
then
gordon
would
have
recourse
to
the
unfailing
authority
van
hepworth
sometimes
he
felt
too
slack
to
copy
out
the
questions
at
all
on
such
occasions
he
would
simply
read
van
hepworth
essay
straight
out
of
the
old
battered
book
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
reading
this
to
you
but
i
was
in
rather
a
hurry
and
i
doubt
if
you
could
quite
read
my
handwriting
finnemore
would
listen
with
the
greatest
interest
very
nice
indeed
caruthers
very
sound
attitude
to
adopt
an
essay
well
worth
preserving
you
will
copy
it
out
neatly
wo
you
oh
yes
sir
gordon
wanted
to
institute
a
van
hepworth
memorial
and
put
up
a
plate
to
him
somewhere
but
there
were
many
obstacles
to
this
the
chief
might
want
to
know
more
about
him
and
the
legend
had
to
be
kept
secret
in
the
end
he
contented
himself
with
having
the
book
bound
in
full
morocco
so
that
it
might
be
preserved
for
future
generations
for
already
the
cardboard
cover
had
become
sadly
torn
where
van
hepworth
is
now
who
knows
this
only
is
certain
that
although
he
has
most
likely
by
now
lost
all
clear
recollection
of
fernhurst
and
the
grey
school
house
studies
yet
his
name
is
remembered
there
with
far
greater
veneration
and
respect
than
was
ever
paid
to
him
during
the
days
of
his
school
career
let
us
now
praise
famous
men
men
of
little
showing
for
their
work
continueth
deep
and
long
continueth
wide
and
far
continueth
far
beyond
their
knowing
and
so
gordon
scholastic
career
came
to
an
end
he
had
reached
the
far
border
town
there
would
be
no
need
to
fret
himself
about
form
orders
any
more
strong
men
might
go
by
and
pass
him
he
had
retired
from
the
fray
while
others
crammed
their
brains
with
obscure
interpretations
of
æschylus
he
lay
back
reading
english
poetry
and
english
prose
striving
to
get
a
clear
hold
of
the
forces
that
went
to
produce
each
movement
and
incidentally
doing
himself
far
more
good
than
he
would
have
done
by
binding
himself
down
to
the
classical
regime
which
trained
boys
to
imitate
and
not
to
strike
out
on
their
own
gordon
had
already
acquired
enough
of
the
taste
and
sense
of
form
which
the
classics
alone
can
provide
and
which
are
essential
to
a
real
culture
but
he
was
lucky
in
stopping
soon
enough
to
prevent
himself
being
forced
into
a
groove
from
which
he
could
only
judge
new
movements
by
the
ciceronian
standards
without
grasping
the
fact
that
technique
and
form
are
merely
outward
coverings
of
genius
and
not
genius
in
themselves
to
the
other
delights
of
this
delightful
term
was
added
the
sudden
and
unexpected
success
of
gordon
cricket
for
the
first
fortnight
gordon
found
himself
playing
on
house
and
colts
games
but
as
he
gathered
runs
there
with
ease
he
was
soon
transplanted
to
the
first
eleven
nets
which
he
thenceforward
only
left
for
a
brief
spell
after
an
attack
of
for
a
member
of
the
school
eleven
life
has
nothing
better
to
offer
than
a
summer
term
there
were
usually
two
matches
a
week
the
team
would
get
off
work
at
ten
and
just
as
the
school
was
pouring
out
in
break
they
would
stroll
leisurely
down
to
the
cricket
field
everything
in
fact
was
carried
out
leisurely
a
wonderful
atmosphere
of
repose
hangs
over
a
cricket
field
in
the
morning
when
the
grass
is
still
sparkling
with
dew
and
there
is
silence
and
vast
emptiness
where
usually
is
the
sound
of
shouting
and
hurrying
feet
there
was
the
long
luncheon
interval
when
the
members
of
the
eleven
would
wander
round
the
field
arm
in
arm
or
lounge
on
the
seats
lazy
and
contented
gordon
loved
to
sit
in
the
pavilion
balcony
watching
the
white
forms
change
across
between
the
overs
the
red
ball
bounce
along
the
grass
the
whip
off
the
bails
the
umpire
finger
go
up
the
whole
tableau
was
so
unreal
so
idealistic
then
the
school
would
come
down
after
lunch
with
rugs
and
cushions
and
would
clamour
outside
the
for
ices
and
ginger
beer
gordon
could
hardly
connect
his
present
existence
with
the
past
two
years
of
doubts
uncertainties
wild
excitements
hurry
bustle
never
a
second
peace
one
of
his
most
perfect
days
was
the
radley
match
after
a
long
journey
at
the
very
end
of
the
day
they
passed
through
oxford
and
gordon
caught
one
fleeting
glimpse
of
those
wonderful
dreaming
spires
rising
golden
in
the
dying
sun
as
the
team
walked
up
from
abingdon
to
the
college
tester
who
had
at
last
got
into
the
side
came
up
and
took
arm
you
know
when
i
saw
oxford
lying
out
there
so
peaceful
and
calm
i
thought
i
had
at
last
reached
the
end
of
searching
this
was
my
first
view
of
oxford
by
passing
the
certificate
i
did
need
to
go
up
for
smalls
thank
god
i
am
going
up
there
next
term
i
think
i
shall
forget
all
my
old
misgivings
in
so
completely
peaceful
an
atmosphere
i
shake
off
the
public
school
ideas
yet
i
am
all
adrift
still
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
there
gordon
wondered
indeed
how
anyone
could
fail
to
find
all
their
dreams
realised
in
so
secluded
so
monastic
a
utopia
the
next
two
days
were
supremely
happy
gordon
lovelace
and
foster
were
put
into
the
same
house
and
they
spent
half
the
night
ragging
in
their
old
fashion
the
match
resembled
most
of
the
other
performances
of
that
year
eleven
the
whole
side
was
out
for
eighty
gordon
hit
two
fours
and
was
then
leg
before
lovelace
with
laborious
efforts
and
much
use
of
his
pads
made
and
five
leg
byes
but
it
was
a
sorry
performance
and
radley
put
up
over
two
hundred
fernhurst
went
in
again
and
that
day
gordon
and
lovelace
were
sent
in
first
it
was
an
amazing
performance
gordon
cricket
was
in
honest
fact
one
of
the
biggest
frauds
that
had
ever
been
inflicted
on
an
opposing
side
he
had
three
shots
a
cut
a
slash
shot
past
cover
and
a
drive
that
landed
the
ball
anywhere
from
to
over
people
used
to
say
that
he
tried
each
of
these
shots
in
rotation
that
perhaps
was
hardly
fair
but
he
invariably
cut
straight
balls
and
pulled
good
length
balls
on
the
off
stump
to
the
on
boundary
this
evening
at
any
rate
he
was
in
luck
with
terrific
violence
he
smote
the
radley
bowling
all
round
the
field
some
shots
went
along
the
ground
more
fell
just
out
of
reach
of
a
fielder
it
was
invigorating
but
hardly
classic
cricket
still
whatever
it
was
it
produced
runs
while
lovelace
had
scored
three
after
he
left
lovelace
became
still
more
cautious
a
man
from
christy
was
in
at
the
other
end
who
had
been
instructed
to
keep
up
his
end
for
an
hour
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
scored
exactly
two
runs
between
them
in
about
that
two
was
from
a
drive
from
lovelace
past
cover
at
such
daring
lovelace
became
much
elated
come
on
i
say
come
on
lots
of
runs
here
come
on
the
radley
men
were
very
amused
lovelace
took
nothing
seriously
it
was
as
well
that
the
bull
was
absent
once
just
as
the
bowler
was
rushing
up
to
bowl
lovelace
flung
out
his
hand
and
said
stop
move
the
screen
please
your
hand
is
just
behind
a
tree
with
great
difficulty
the
screens
were
moved
once
he
patted
the
ball
a
little
way
down
the
pitch
and
shouted
to
the
batsman
at
the
other
end
with
hand
extended
stay
there
was
some
subdued
laughter
lovelace
turned
round
to
the
and
said
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
am
the
worst
member
of
this
rotten
side
and
i
am
playing
for
my
place
this
is
the
way
to
keep
your
place
at
fernhurst
the
final
achievement
was
a
successful
appeal
against
the
light
the
next
day
it
rained
in
torrents
jolly
rotten
luck
said
lovelace
and
i
was
certain
for
a
bat
for
making
my
fifty
too
do
you
think
so
said
tester
you
know
they
do
play
to
a
finish
in
england
you
are
thinking
of
australian
rules
commemoration
came
and
went
with
its
parasols
books
sermons
and
cricket
match
the
term
drew
to
its
close
this
is
the
best
term
i
have
ever
had
said
gordon
by
jove
we
have
had
some
good
days
yet
of
all
things
that
which
remained
clearest
in
his
memory
was
one
day
early
in
the
term
when
he
and
lovelace
were
recovering
from
the
school
had
gone
for
a
field
day
to
salisbury
and
they
were
left
behind
with
archie
fletcher
who
had
been
ragging
jenks
and
had
been
kept
back
for
punishment
and
a
quantity
of
small
fry
no
work
was
done
in
the
morning
they
all
had
to
go
into
the
big
schoolroom
and
hear
claremont
read
and
parts
of
claremont
read
remarkably
well
and
gordon
in
an
atmosphere
of
genial
tolerance
and
good
humour
was
able
to
get
a
clearer
insight
into
the
real
soul
of
the
pedant
of
the
lower
fifth
for
shorn
of
his
trappings
claremont
was
a
dear
old
fellow
among
books
he
had
found
the
lasting
friendship
and
consolation
that
among
his
colleagues
he
had
sought
in
vain
and
as
he
read
in
many
ways
the
most
truly
poetical
poem
in
the
english
language
gordon
realised
how
sensitively
heart
was
wrought
upon
by
every
breath
of
beauty
the
afternoon
they
had
to
themselves
a
net
was
put
up
on
the
field
and
for
an
hour
or
so
they
beat
about
regardless
of
science
and
footwork
a
relaxation
was
a
good
thing
now
and
again
then
they
went
back
to
the
studies
and
in
the
absence
of
its
owner
laid
hold
of
the
games
study
they
had
the
run
of
it
now
and
with
an
enormous
basket
of
strawberries
before
them
played
tunes
on
the
gramophone
and
roared
the
chorus
as
the
evening
fell
and
the
lights
began
to
wake
gordon
and
archie
stole
down
to
the
fried
fish
shop
strictly
out
of
bounds
and
returned
with
an
unsavoury
but
none
the
less
palatable
parcel
of
fried
fish
and
chips
it
was
a
glorious
day
they
enjoyed
all
fernhurst
privileges
with
its
restrictions
removed
and
when
the
notes
of
of
hope
and
proclaimed
that
the
corps
was
marching
up
cheap
street
they
considered
the
return
to
realities
to
be
almost
an
intrusion
on
their
isolated
peace
in
the
last
week
of
the
term
the
colts
played
downside
and
gordon
was
still
young
enough
to
play
for
them
the
bull
went
with
them
and
could
not
have
been
kinder
he
walked
round
the
ground
with
gordon
in
the
interval
as
if
there
had
been
never
any
cause
of
quarrel
between
them
at
all
they
talked
of
books
as
well
as
cricket
and
though
the
bull
gods
were
not
gordon
there
was
real
sympathy
between
them
for
an
hour
on
the
way
back
in
the
train
gordon
wondered
whether
after
all
he
had
not
been
right
at
the
beginning
when
he
promised
to
curb
his
personality
and
merge
it
into
the
bull
what
good
was
there
in
going
his
own
way
in
fighting
for
what
he
thought
right
buller
always
had
had
his
own
way
and
things
had
gone
on
all
right
why
should
he
try
and
alter
things
having
realised
the
bull
faults
should
he
not
make
allowance
for
them
seeing
that
his
virtues
so
outnumbered
his
failings
he
was
certainly
intolerant
of
any
other
opinions
but
his
own
but
then
so
was
ferrers
whom
gordon
worshipped
on
the
other
side
of
idolatry
the
pity
was
that
ferrers
was
intolerant
of
the
things
he
hated
while
buller
was
intolerant
of
the
things
he
admired
it
was
all
very
difficult
for
the
moment
he
did
not
feel
ready
to
come
to
any
decision
he
was
too
happy
to
trouble
himself
sufficient
for
the
day
were
the
day
evil
things
let
the
future
reveal
itself
he
would
see
how
things
turned
out
the
concert
came
with
its
of
many
memories
the
school
songs
were
howled
out
hands
crossed
and
swung
in
lang
the
nearly
brought
the
roof
down
lying
back
in
bed
gordon
saw
little
to
regret
in
the
school
year
that
was
just
ending
considering
he
had
been
second
in
the
batting
averages
he
thought
they
might
have
given
him
his
firsts
but
it
did
not
matter
very
much
there
was
heaps
of
time
three
years
of
fulfilment
half
his
school
life
was
over
the
threads
of
his
youth
had
been
unravelled
at
last
and
in
the
coming
year
they
would
be
woven
upon
the
wonderful
loom
of
youth
with
its
bright
colours
its
sunshine
and
its
laughter
as
the
spring
morn
flings
aside
its
winter
raiment
so
he
had
put
off
the
garb
of
his
wandering
adolescence
he
was
prepared
for
whatever
might
come
but
he
was
certain
that
it
was
only
happiness
that
was
waiting
for
him
three
years
of
success
in
which
would
be
mingled
the
real
poetry
of
existence
he
would
not
write
his
poetry
on
paper
he
would
write
it
as
herod
had
written
it
in
every
action
of
his
life
his
innings
was
just
about
to
begin

chapter
i
the
twilight
of
the
gods
it
is
good
to
dream
but
man
proposes
god
in
his
time
disposes
and
gordon
dream
was
scattered
at
its
dawn
hardly
a
week
later
a
great
nation
forgot
its
greatness
and
europe
trembled
on
the
brink
of
war
during
those
days
of
awful
suspense
when
it
was
uncertain
whether
england
would
enter
into
the
contest
or
not
gordon
could
hardly
keep
still
with
nervous
excitement
when
on
the
sunday
before
bank
holiday
garvin
poured
out
his
warning
to
the
liberal
government
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
they
were
going
to
back
out
on
the
tuesday
gordon
went
to
the
oval
lovelace
major
was
playing
against
surrey
in
the
strand
he
ran
into
ferrers
come
on
sir
i
am
just
off
to
the
oval
to
see
lovelace
brother
bat
great
fellow
captain
of
the
house
my
first
term
right
you
are
come
on
there
a
bus
for
hours
or
what
seemed
like
hours
two
painfully
correct
professionals
pottered
about
scoring
by
ones
and
twos
gordon
longed
for
them
to
get
out
a
catch
was
missed
in
the
slips
surrey
are
the
worst
side
in
england
announced
gordon
fiercely
the
oval
crowd
always
so
ferociously
partisan
moved
round
him
uneasily
at
last
a
roar
went
up
as
hitch
knocked
the
leg
stump
flying
out
of
the
ground
then
lovelace
came
in
he
looked
just
as
he
had
looked
on
the
green
fernhurst
sward
only
perhaps
a
little
broader
he
was
wearing
the
magenta
and
black
of
the
school
house
scarf
he
was
an
amateur
of
the
foster
type
wrist
shots
past
cover
and
an
honest
a
change
came
over
the
play
at
once
in
his
first
over
he
hit
two
fours
there
was
a
stir
round
the
ground
his
personality
was
as
strong
as
ever
a
boy
ran
on
the
field
with
a
telegram
for
him
i
bet
that
means
he
has
got
to
join
his
regiment
said
gordon
and
it
also
means
we
are
going
to
fight
lovelace
shoved
the
telegram
into
his
pocket
and
went
on
batting
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
just
as
if
he
did
not
realise
that
this
was
his
last
innings
for
a
very
long
time
he
hit
all
round
the
wicket
at
last
a
brilliant
piece
of
stumping
sent
him
back
to
the
pavilion
amid
a
roar
of
cheering
my
word
mr
ferrers
there
goes
the
finest
man
fernhurst
has
turned
out
since
i
have
been
there
and
my
word
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
turn
out
another
like
him
there
will
be
nothing
to
see
now
he
has
gone
they
wandered
out
into
the
kennington
road
excited
feverish
they
had
lunch
at
gatti
went
into
and
and
came
out
after
the
first
act
this
is
no
time
for
german
jews
said
ferrers
let
try
the
hippodrome
it
was
an
expensive
day
they
rushed
from
one
thing
to
another
the
strain
was
intolerable
after
supper
they
went
to
the
west
end
cinema
and
there
just
before
a
film
in
which
everyone
was
falling
into
a
dirty
for
no
ostensible
reason
was
suddenly
stopped
and
there
appeared
across
the
screen
the
flaming
notice
england
has
declared
war
on
germany
god
save
the
king
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
moment
then
cheer
upon
cheer
convulsed
the
house
the
band
struck
up
the
national
anthem
the
sequel
to
the
tragedy
of
the
was
never
known
glorious
glorious
said
ferrers
as
they
staggered
out
into
the
cool
night
air
a
war
is
what
we
want
it
will
wake
us
up
from
sleeping
stir
us
into
life
inflame
our
literature
there
a
real
chance
now
of
sweeping
away
the
old
outworn
traditions
in
a
great
fire
they
will
all
be
burnt
then
we
can
build
afresh
i
wish
i
could
go
and
fight
damn
my
heart
to
think
of
all
the
running
it
stood
at
oxford
and
then
suddenly
to
give
way
my
doctor
always
tells
me
to
be
careful
if
i
could
go
by
god
i
would
have
my
shot
at
the
bloody
germans
but
still
i
do
something
at
fernhurst
stoics
you
know
army
class
english
how
old
are
you
sixteen
we
shall
have
you
for
two
years
yet
this
war
is
going
to
save
england
and
everything
glorious
the
flaring
lights
of
leicester
square
the
tawdry
brilliance
of
piccadilly
seemed
to
burst
into
one
volcano
of
red
splendour
a
thousand
cannons
spitting
flame
a
thousand
eyes
bright
with
love
of
england
the
swaying
tube
swept
gordon
home
in
a
state
of
subconscious
delirium
to
the
starlit
calm
of
hampstead
throughout
the
long
summer
holidays
this
feeling
of
rejoicing
sustained
gordon
heart
he
saw
an
age
rising
out
of
these
purging
fires
that
would
rival
the
elizabethan
he
saw
a
second
marlowe
and
a
second
webster
his
soul
was
aflame
with
hope
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
result
even
the
long
retreat
from
mons
with
its
bitter
list
of
casualties
failed
to
terrorise
him
half
the
holidays
he
spent
in
wychtown
a
little
somersetshire
village
and
his
enthusiasm
at
one
time
took
the
form
of
buying
bundles
of
newspapers
which
he
distributed
at
the
cottages
so
as
to
keep
everyone
in
touch
with
the
state
of
affairs
at
one
time
he
thought
of
going
round
discussing
the
war
with
some
of
the
villagers
but
he
soon
abandoned
this
project
he
began
with
an
aged
man
who
had
fought
at
majuba
well
mr
cavendish
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
war
this
morning
lor
bless
you
things
beant
what
they
were
in
my
young
days
at
majuba
now
we
did
things
a
bit
but
these
germans
now
they
be
getting
on
right
well
be
they
for
us
after
this
gordon
decided
that
the
natural
simplicity
of
the
yokel
was
proof
against
anything
he
might
have
to
say
he
pitied
electioneering
agents
a
week
before
the
beginning
of
term
he
received
two
letters
the
first
was
from
lovelace
who
had
got
a
nomination
to
sandhurst
and
would
not
return
to
school
next
term
the
other
was
from
hunter
saying
that
he
had
won
a
commission
in
the
dorsets
caruthers
old
he
added
means
that
you
will
be
captain
of
the
house
i
had
greatly
looked
forward
to
being
captain
myself
and
had
thought
out
a
good
many
new
ideas
but
of
course
all
that
has
got
to
go
now
and
i
do
intend
to
try
and
pass
off
my
theories
on
you
you
probably
have
many
more
than
i
had
and
a
good
deal
better
ones
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
wish
the
very
best
of
luck
to
you
and
to
the
house
i
have
no
doubt
you
do
jolly
well
good
gordon
sat
silent
for
a
long
while
sorrow
at
losing
lovelace
strove
with
the
joy
of
reaching
his
heart
desire
so
soon
finally
all
other
emotions
were
lost
in
the
overflowing
sense
of
relief
that
his
days
of
waiting
for
achievement
were
over
in
a
mood
of
supreme
he
returned
to
fernhurst
at
waterloo
everyone
was
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
is
it
true
akerman
has
left
yes
got
a
commission
in
the
middlesex
good
lord
that
mean
gregory
captain
hunter
has
left
too
i
hear
has
he
caruthers
will
be
captain
of
the
house
then
broken
sentences
were
wafted
like
strange
music
to
gordon
ears
he
felt
that
the
eyes
of
those
who
once
had
been
his
equals
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
oriental
admiration
in
which
there
lurked
traces
of
fear
he
found
himself
addressed
with
more
respect
one
or
two
people
came
up
to
congratulate
him
the
green
flag
waved
the
train
moved
majestically
westward
and
his
reign
had
begun
he
did
not
feel
the
slightest
tremor
of
nervousness
he
remembered
hunter
saying
at
the
end
of
last
term
that
it
was
ticklish
work
being
captain
of
the
house
was
it
to
gordon
it
seemed
no
more
than
the
inevitable
entrance
into
a
kingdom
which
was
his
by
right
of
conquest
the
eversham
road
swept
in
its
broad
curve
up
to
the
abbey
black
with
moving
figures
gordon
slowly
walked
up
to
the
house
it
was
the
privilege
of
school
house
prefects
to
enter
by
a
small
gate
near
the
masters
common
room
haughtily
he
rang
the
bell
a
wizened
old
lady
opened
the
door
bowing
with
a
hope
you
a
good
sir
it
was
the
first
sensation
of
power
a
crowd
had
collected
round
the
in
the
gordon
murmured
thank
you
and
two
or
three
eton
collars
moved
aside
to
give
him
room
what
a
change
all
the
giants
of
the
former
generation
had
gone
betteridge
had
at
the
express
request
of
the
chief
come
back
for
one
term
but
he
alone
remained
gordon
was
fifth
in
the
house
and
good
lord
that
amazing
ass
rudd
was
a
prefect
and
second
in
the
house
he
and
gordon
had
a
double
dormitory
on
the
lower
landing
the
number
of
boys
in
the
house
had
sunk
to
rather
a
desolating
thought
for
house
matches
the
chief
was
not
in
his
study
gordon
dropped
a
health
certificate
on
his
table
and
gave
instructions
to
one
morgan
a
ruddy
youth
to
shove
his
bag
into
his
dormitory
then
he
wandered
over
to
the
games
study
and
so
this
study
was
going
to
be
his
he
had
often
sat
there
with
carter
but
he
had
always
felt
himself
an
excrescence
now
it
was
his
own
he
pictured
the
evenings
after
a
hard
game
of
football
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
the
long
mornings
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
preparing
history
for
finnemore
spent
in
this
atmosphere
of
luxurious
calm
he
planned
his
furnishing
of
the
room
in
the
broad
window
he
would
hang
two
bookshelves
for
his
smaller
books
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
there
was
also
room
for
bookshelves
then
standing
against
the
wooden
partition
that
jutted
out
into
the
room
would
be
his
large
oak
bookcase
for
the
heavy
volumes
he
would
repaper
the
room
and
a
new
carpet
was
a
necessity
he
went
over
to
the
porter
lodge
to
give
instructions
he
had
already
decided
to
ask
foster
to
share
the
study
with
him
foster
would
be
captain
of
cricket
next
summer
they
would
get
on
well
together
foster
never
quarrelled
with
anyone
and
it
would
be
a
suitable
combination
he
met
foster
by
the
train
from
exeter
and
informed
him
of
the
fact
when
prayers
came
and
gordon
stood
under
the
mantelpiece
behind
the
where
the
captain
of
the
house
sat
and
looked
down
at
the
row
of
new
boys
at
the
table
it
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
he
had
ever
been
like
that
and
yet
it
was
only
three
years
ago
since
he
had
sat
there
dazed
and
frightened
prayers
were
ended
gordon
sat
back
his
hands
resting
on
the
arms
of
his
big
oak
chair
the
chief
came
round
shaking
hands
caruthers
foster
and
davenport
you
might
come
and
speak
to
me
for
a
moment
after
you
have
finished
your
supper
that
was
not
long
no
one
had
ever
been
known
to
touch
any
of
the
soup
gordon
had
often
wondered
what
happened
to
it
there
was
much
of
it
and
all
wasted
the
chief
greeted
them
with
his
invariable
fluttering
smile
i
suppose
you
know
what
i
want
you
for
kitchener
called
up
his
reserves
so
i
have
had
to
call
up
mine
none
of
you
would
i
think
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
have
become
prefects
this
term
but
as
it
is
i
am
sure
you
will
all
do
well
and
remember
that
being
a
prefect
does
not
merely
consist
in
the
privilege
of
being
late
for
breakfast
some
of
you
who
may
very
likely
have
views
of
your
own
on
certain
subjects
must
try
and
make
them
conform
with
mine
we
must
all
try
to
work
together
and
i
am
always
ready
to
give
any
of
you
advice
if
i
am
able
to
and
of
course
at
this
moment
there
came
the
discordant
sounds
that
proclaimed
the
arrival
of
the
last
train
from
town
gordon
could
imagine
some
wretched
new
boy
huddled
underneath
the
stairs
ignorant
and
timid
rudd
burst
in
with
a
health
certificate
and
outside
came
the
babble
of
voices
i
must
go
and
see
chief
health
certificate
confirmation
classes
going
to
specialise
in
stinks
it
was
clear
that
the
chief
was
to
have
a
hard
time
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
interviewing
all
these
candidates
for
a
satisfactory
division
of
labour
well
i
think
that
is
all
just
now
thank
you
he
gave
them
a
nod
of
dismissal
they
filed
out
into
the
passage
black
with
its
crowd
of
clamouring
applicants
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
however
that
gordon
fully
realised
the
change
that
had
come
over
fernhurst
nearly
all
the
bloods
had
left
gregory
was
still
there
but
he
had
sent
his
papers
in
and
expected
to
be
gazetted
in
a
week
or
so
and
of
the
fifteen
of
the
year
before
he
was
the
only
remaining
colour
two
members
of
the
second
fifteen
remained
one
because
he
was
only
seventeen
the
other
younger
brother
because
he
was
going
to
be
a
medical
student
and
was
not
allowed
to
take
a
commission
by
the
war
office
the
staff
also
had
undergone
several
changes
ferrers
was
practically
the
only
master
under
thirty
the
rest
had
all
taken
commissions
and
their
places
were
filled
by
and
long
since
past
their
prime
it
was
a
case
of
extreme
youth
face
to
face
with
extreme
age
there
will
be
some
fun
this
term
prophesied
archie
fletcher
for
whom
the
immediate
future
stretched
out
into
a
long
series
of
colossal
rags
rogers
was
imperially
himself
the
corps
was
of
course
to
be
allowed
considerably
more
time
this
term
there
were
two
parades
a
week
one
a
company
drill
on
friday
the
other
a
field
day
on
wednesday
besides
this
between
and
lunch
there
would
be
section
and
platoon
drill
every
day
rogers
imagined
that
work
would
shortly
become
more
important
and
more
popular
than
football
he
saw
himself
taking
the
position
once
held
by
buller
on
the
strength
of
this
alluring
prospect
he
bought
a
new
uniform
for
the
first
few
days
life
was
entertainingly
disorganised
the
worked
out
all
wrong
gregory
got
gazetted
and
akerman
on
becoming
captain
forgot
the
numbers
of
the
football
grounds
thus
causing
endless
and
hilarious
confusion
no
one
quite
knew
what
was
happening
but
everyone
was
happily
excited
and
vaguely
garrulous
about
how
the
war
has
changed
things
gordon
found
that
his
new
position
brought
with
it
certain
other
honours
in
the
corps
for
instance
where
for
three
years
he
had
so
tempered
slackness
with
insolence
as
to
make
him
the
worst
private
in
the
company
he
found
himself
a
in
charge
of
a
section
he
was
elected
to
the
dolts
literary
society
under
the
placid
autocracy
of
claremont
who
called
them
his
stolidi
but
nothing
showed
more
clearly
the
change
wrought
by
the
war
than
the
fact
that
gordon
was
nominated
to
the
games
committee
before
which
august
body
hardly
six
months
ago
he
had
cut
such
an
inglorious
figure
it
was
a
strange
irony
in
the
school
house
every
prefect
was
allowed
four
fags
so
as
foster
and
gordon
were
both
prefects
the
games
study
had
a
goodly
crowd
of
menials
for
the
most
part
they
were
simple
insignificant
mortals
who
flitted
round
the
room
after
breakfast
with
dusters
and
at
various
other
times
of
the
day
came
in
to
see
after
the
fire
gordon
took
little
notice
of
them
foster
had
made
out
a
list
of
the
days
on
which
each
fag
was
on
duty
one
hare
was
put
in
charge
and
when
anything
went
wrong
hare
was
considered
responsible
and
beaten
after
two
such
castigations
the
excellence
of
the
fagging
was
maintained
at
an
unusually
high
standard
the
first
fortnight
of
the
term
was
feverish
corps
work
was
revivified
under
the
stimulus
of
war
the
field
days
by
babylon
hill
provided
genuine
excitement
in
spite
of
the
prolixity
of
rogers
subsequent
summary
of
the
day
work
there
were
going
to
be
very
few
football
matches
but
uppers
were
played
with
the
old
keenness
and
there
was
fierce
competition
for
the
last
places
in
the
scrum
ferrers
wrote
a
long
article
to
on
the
public
schools
and
the
war
which
bubbled
over
with
enthusiasm
gordon
found
authority
a
pleasant
thing
there
were
of
course
bound
to
be
little
worries
but
they
were
transient
the
new
boys
caused
him
a
certain
amount
of
trouble
they
never
would
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
if
they
were
posted
for
house
games
the
result
was
that
as
often
as
not
the
house
found
itself
playing
with
only
six
forwards
gordon
made
a
speech
to
the
house
on
the
subject
the
very
next
day
golding
a
most
specimen
failed
to
turn
up
on
a
house
game
gordon
gave
him
a
lecture
on
the
insignificance
of
the
new
boy
and
the
importance
of
games
this
sort
of
thing
ca
go
on
he
said
using
the
formula
that
every
prefect
has
used
since
the
day
prefects
were
first
made
if
it
did
we
might
find
everyone
cutting
house
games
and
going
off
to
what
would
happen
then
golding
was
far
too
frightened
to
have
any
views
on
the
subject
well
i
shall
have
to
beat
you
gordon
led
the
way
to
the
empty
space
by
the
cloisters
where
roll
was
called
bend
over
there
golding
showed
a
natural
reluctance
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
no
right
down
and
lift
up
your
coat
gordon
gave
him
a
fairly
hard
stroke
golding
squealed
oh
and
rose
holding
his
trousers
and
looking
round
fretfully
gordon
heart
melted
after
all
this
was
a
new
kid
and
a
pretty
poor
specimen
at
that
the
next
shot
was
very
gentle
the
sequel
reached
gordon
three
days
later
golding
had
gone
back
down
to
the
rudd
was
taking
hall
which
was
of
course
an
excuse
for
everyone
to
talk
how
many
asked
several
voices
did
he
hurt
oh
only
one
and
a
half
announced
golding
puffed
out
with
pride
first
hardly
hurt
me
at
all
and
the
second
one
was
quite
a
misfire
this
was
rather
a
surprise
to
those
who
remembered
gordon
driving
power
golding
was
thought
rather
a
lad
after
all
gordon
however
soon
dispelled
this
illusion
a
week
later
he
went
down
to
the
house
game
in
which
golding
was
playing
and
cursed
him
roundly
all
the
afternoon
with
perfect
justice
after
tea
he
gave
him
six
for
slacking
and
all
delusions
about
golding
bravery
were
immediately
dispelled
damned
little
tick
said
gordon
he
made
such
a
fuss
that
i
let
him
off
lightly
and
then
he
goes
down
to
the
and
makes
out
i
am
a
wreck
collins
i
charge
thee
put
away
compassion
it
does
not
pay
with
these
degenerates
there
is
nothing
more
interesting
to
the
artist
than
watching
a
thing
grow
under
one
hand
and
gordon
who
had
the
ambition
of
the
artist
in
embryo
was
thoroughly
engrossed
in
the
training
of
his
house
sides
junior
was
a
promising
side
it
beat
claremont
by
twenty
points
and
rogers
by
over
fifty
morgan
captained
the
side
and
was
easily
the
best
man
in
it
but
among
the
lesser
lights
there
was
a
great
display
of
energy
much
of
it
misplaced
the
worst
offender
was
bray
to
watch
him
play
was
to
witness
a
gladiatorial
display
of
frightfulness
his
fists
flew
about
like
a
flail
his
legs
were
everywhere
on
the
whole
he
did
more
damage
to
his
own
side
than
to
his
opponents
and
the
amount
of
energy
he
wasted
every
game
in
hacking
the
bodies
of
any
who
got
in
his
way
must
have
been
exhausting
gordon
had
to
speak
to
him
almost
severely
once
or
twice
in
the
game
against
rogers
bray
nearly
got
sent
off
the
field
there
had
been
a
tight
scrum
which
had
more
or
less
collapsed
the
whistle
blew
jenks
had
been
persuaded
to
referee
now
then
form
up
properly
there
when
the
two
scrums
assorted
themselves
bray
was
discovered
about
five
yards
from
the
ball
sitting
on
the
head
of
a
wretched
fat
unwashed
product
of
rogers
punching
him
violently
and
ejaculating
after
each
punch
damn
you
damn
you
damn
you
jenks
looked
very
fierce
now
then
you
stupid
fellows
if
you
go
on
like
that
i
shall
have
to
report
you
to
the
headmaster
and
you
know
what
that
will
mean
bray
looked
a
little
frightened
and
for
the
future
devoted
his
energies
to
the
football
and
not
the
footballers
to
the
distinct
advantage
of
the
side
but
gordon
began
to
find
that
the
more
his
interest
increased
in
house
games
the
less
interest
he
took
in
uppers
and
fifteen
puntabouts
he
was
always
wanting
to
go
and
see
how
his
house
was
getting
on
as
soon
as
the
first
keenness
wore
off
he
found
the
interminable
uppers
totally
unrelieved
by
the
excitement
of
matches
amazingly
dull
indeed
the
whole
school
side
was
beginning
to
grow
weary
every
monday
and
thursday
there
was
a
puntabout
every
tuesday
and
saturday
there
was
the
same
game
first
fifteen
second
fifteen
with
one
or
two
masters
such
as
christy
who
were
no
longer
as
young
as
they
had
been
the
result
was
invariably
the
same
the
first
fifteen
won
by
forty
points
and
were
cursed
by
the
bull
for
not
winning
by
sixty
no
one
could
possibly
enjoy
such
monotony
every
week
the
business
became
more
unpopular
the
bull
stamped
up
and
down
with
a
whistle
in
his
hand
i
never
saw
such
slackness
what
good
do
you
imagine
you
men
will
be
in
the
trenches
if
you
ca
last
out
a
short
game
of
rugger
like
this
i
do
know
what
the
school
is
coming
to
the
side
which
had
never
been
good
got
worse
daily
as
a
captain
the
younger
akerman
was
a
nonentity
buller
was
captain
of
the
side
in
everything
but
name
you
know
foster
said
gordon
one
saturday
evening
after
a
more
than
usually
dreary
performance
these
uppers
are
getting
about
the
ruddy
limit
have
you
taken
all
this
time
to
find
that
out
growled
foster
i
used
to
like
footer
once
last
year
we
had
a
good
time
on
those
colts
games
of
course
the
old
buffalo
lost
his
hair
a
good
deal
but
the
games
were
level
at
any
rate
i
can
see
no
sort
of
fun
in
winning
every
time
by
forty
points
why
ca
we
have
games
so
as
to
get
level
sides
i
suppose
bull
wants
to
get
the
side
working
together
perhaps
he
does
but
why
if
there
are
going
to
be
no
matches
till
through
november
the
downside
match
is
four
weeks
off
and
till
then
we
have
to
continue
this
silly
farce
twice
a
week
and
after
all
it
does
not
teach
us
defence
in
the
least
our
men
have
not
to
do
any
collaring
if
we
run
up
against
a
side
that
is
any
use
at
attack
we
shall
be
hopelessly
dished
i
think
we
shall
be
dished
anyhow
and
i
am
damned
if
i
care
much
buller
has
knocked
all
the
keenness
out
of
me
and
the
rest
of
the
side
say
the
same
thing
do
you
know
i
actually
look
forward
to
corps
parade
day
the
same
with
me
i
am
fed
to
death
with
footer
still
we
are
having
a
jolly
good
time
off
the
field
are
we
oh
yes
we
are
prefects
we
have
got
to
do
any
work
and
interesting
coaching
the
kids
foster
looked
dubiously
at
him
he
had
no
side
to
coach
he
also
had
to
do
some
work
for
his
sandhurst
exam
next
term
but
gordon
crown
was
as
yet
too
fresh
to
feel
the
tarnishing
damp
of
disappointment
october
went
by
with
its
leaves
and
amber
sunlight
november
swept
in
bringing
a
procession
of
long
evenings
and
flickering
lights
the
first
boom
of
the
war
fever
died
down
the
fifteen
played
listlessly
upper
followed
upper
puntabout
followed
puntabout
no
one
cared
who
was
in
the
side
foster
was
left
out
and
thanked
heaven
i
am
about
sick
of
being
cursed
off
my
feet
and
told
i
shall
be
no
good
in
the
trenches
because
i
miss
my
passes
bull
has
gone
gordon
to
keep
in
the
side
it
would
not
do
for
the
house
captain
to
get
a
reputation
for
slackness
his
play
lacked
its
old
fire
and
dash
but
was
still
good
enough
to
earn
him
his
place
he
knew
he
was
going
off
that
he
was
not
nearly
so
good
as
he
had
been
the
year
before
the
thought
worried
him
but
still
junior
was
doing
very
well
one
saturday
evening
there
came
the
sound
of
thumping
feet
down
the
passage
someone
banged
himself
against
the
door
and
a
voice
was
shouting
hullo
caruthers
my
lad
gordon
swung
round
to
find
mansell
with
hand
looking
magnificent
in
the
and
spurs
of
the
come
in
sit
down
by
jove
this
is
like
old
times
i
must
call
up
archie
archie
here
someone
to
see
you
mansell
was
just
the
same
as
he
had
been
a
year
ago
a
little
older
a
little
stronger
a
little
more
the
man
of
the
world
he
was
full
of
stories
how
his
men
had
nearly
mutinied
because
they
thought
their
separation
allowance
insufficient
how
he
had
chased
deserters
half
across
england
how
he
had
taken
the
pretty
waitress
at
the
café
to
the
music
hall
it
life
that
what
it
is
i
never
knew
what
life
was
till
i
went
to
bournemouth
oh
my
god
we
do
have
a
time
damned
hard
work
of
course
but
we
do
have
a
time
in
the
evenings
my
lord
i
nearly
put
my
foot
in
it
the
other
night
i
saw
the
devil
of
a
smart
girl
walking
down
the
street
and
i
could
have
sworn
i
knew
her
i
went
up
and
said
for
a
stroll
o
lord
you
should
have
seen
her
turn
round
i
thought
she
would
fetch
a
policeman
and
we
have
a
jolly
good
footer
side
too
we
fairly
smashed
the
last
week
oh
it
grand
but
still
i
suppose
you
are
not
having
a
bad
time
here
it
good
to
see
you
lads
again
on
the
next
day
mansell
stood
an
enormous
tea
in
the
games
study
everyone
of
any
importance
came
the
gramophone
played
songs
were
sung
never
was
there
seen
so
much
food
before
mansell
seemed
like
a
greek
god
who
had
for
a
moment
descended
to
earth
to
reveal
a
glimpse
of
what
olympus
was
like
gordon
went
down
and
saw
him
off
by
the
my
word
i
envy
you
mansell
he
said
i
should
i
often
wish
i
was
back
again
in
the
house
all
those
old
days
with
claremont
and
trundle
the
footer
and
all
that
we
had
a
darned
fine
time
make
the
most
of
it
while
you
got
it
as
gordon
walked
back
alone
he
had
the
unpleasant
feeling
that
the
best
was
over
that
the
days
of
ragging
of
footer
of
claremont
of
trundle
had
gone
beyond
recall
the
friends
of
his
first
term
hunter
lovelace
mansell
they
had
all
gone
scattered
to
the
winds
he
alone
remained
and
with
a
sudden
pain
he
wondered
whether
he
had
not
outlived
his
day
whether
like
tithonus
he
was
not
taking
more
than
he
had
been
meant
to
take
but
then
as
he
walked
through
the
small
gateway
and
majestically
wandered
up
the
chief
drive
he
reflected
that
even
if
his
splendour
was
a
lonely
one
without
the
laughter
and
comradeship
he
could
have
wished
for
yet
it
was
none
the
less
a
splendour
he
must
hold
on
as
mansell
had
said
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
while
he
had
it
a
small
boy
came
up
nervously
please
caruthers
may
i
have
leave
off
games
for
a
week
i
have
had
a
bad
foot
did
matron
say
so
oh
yes
all
right
then
he
walked
up
the
stairs
to
his
study
smiling
to
himself
what
had
he
been
fretting
himself
about
he
had
his
power
he
had
the
things
he
had
wanted
it
not
brave
to
be
a
king
it
not
passing
brave
to
be
a
ride
in
triumph
through
persepolis
marlowe
had
been
right
marlowe
with
the
pagan
soul
that
loved
material
things
glitter
and
splendour
crowns
and
roses

god
is
not
so
glorious
as
a
king
ask
and
have
command
and
be
and
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
a
king
he
must
make
the
best
of
his
kingdom
while
he
held
it
chapter
ii
setting
stars
the
same
atmosphere
of
monotonous
depression
that
overhung
football
soon
began
to
affect
the
military
side
of
school
life
as
well
at
first
there
had
been
the
spur
of
novelty
the
substitution
of
platoon
drill
for
the
old
company
routine
and
the
frequent
field
days
led
to
keenness
but
even
the
most
energetic
get
weary
of
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
three
times
a
week
there
are
only
three
different
formations
in
platoon
drill
which
anyone
can
learn
in
and
the
days
were
long
past
when
gordon
extraordinary
commands
would
form
his
platoon
into
an
impossible
rabble
that
could
only
be
extricated
by
the
ungrammatical
but
effective
command
that
school
house
section
commanders
had
used
from
the
first
day
of
militarism
as
you
did
ought
those
days
were
over
no
mistakes
for
minutes
every
monday
wednesday
and
friday
the
school
house
platoon
would
move
round
the
courts
in
lifeless
and
perfect
formation
and
by
now
the
school
had
begun
to
suspect
that
the
field
days
were
conducted
mainly
to
satisfy
rogers
inordinate
conceit
his
house
had
always
the
advantage
the
limit
of
endurance
was
reached
one
day
early
in
november
when
rogers
took
his
house
out
to
defend
babylon
hill
against
the
rest
of
the
corps
the
attack
was
really
rather
brilliant
babylon
hill
overlooks
the
country
for
miles
there
was
a
splendid
field
of
fire
it
was
a
boiling
hot
day
rogers
men
lay
happily
on
the
hill
firing
spasmodically
at
khaki
figures
crawling
up
the
long
valley
their
position
seemed
impregnable
early
in
the
proceedings
however
ferrers
who
was
conducting
the
attack
sent
betteridge
with
the
school
house
platoon
on
an
enormous
detour
to
bring
in
a
flank
attack
if
successful
the
school
house
platoon
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
wipe
out
the
defence
and
rogers
would
never
notice
their
loss
as
they
were
sent
off
at
a
moment
when
the
attack
was
crossing
some
dead
ground
forlorn
hopes
occasionally
come
off
and
by
a
fluke
at
the
very
moment
when
the
attack
surged
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
exhausted
platoon
with
shouts
and
cheers
burst
into
rogers
flank
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
defence
had
been
cut
to
pieces
for
a
minute
or
two
rogers
looked
perplexed
at
the
sea
of
enemies
then
with
customary
urbanity
he
told
ferrers
to
form
up
his
men
and
seat
them
on
the
ground
while
he
gave
his
impression
of
the
day
work
i
think
the
attack
was
quite
satisfactory
of
course
it
stood
little
chance
against
the
defence
for
which
i
myself
was
in
a
way
responsible
i
believe
most
of
the
forces
would
have
been
destroyed
coming
up
the
hill
but
i
think
the
day
had
a
good
effect
on
the
morale
of
the
troops
now
morale
he
enlarged
on
the
qualities
of
morale
and
discipline
for
about
ten
minutes
and
concluded
with
the
following
courteous
reference
to
the
school
house
flanking
movement
i
could
not
clearly
discern
what
those
persons
were
doing
who
came
up
on
my
left
they
would
have
been
entirely
wiped
out
i
considered
it
somewhat
foolish
a
contemptuous
titter
broke
from
the
school
house
platoon
in
which
amusement
and
annoyance
were
equally
mixed
what
is
the
good
of
trying
at
all
said
gordon
at
tea
that
night
there
were
we
sweating
over
ploughed
fields
banging
through
fences
racing
up
beastly
paths
and
then
that
mouthing
prelate
says
silly
what
the
use
of
trying
there
is
none
said
betteridge
i
am
going
to
conduct
this
platoon
in
future
on
different
lines
be
thou
my
good
as
the
lad
milton
said
we
will
be
unorthodox
original
and
rebellious
a
few
days
later
gordon
and
rudd
saw
displayed
in
a
window
a
wondrous
collection
of
coloured
silk
does
anyone
really
wear
those
things
said
gordon
i
suppose
so
or
they
would
show
them
they
are
certainly
amazing
they
stood
looking
at
them
as
one
would
at
a
heathen
god
then
suddenly
gordon
clutched
rudd
sleeve
a
notion
my
word
a
notion
let
buy
some
pairs
and
wear
them
at
platoon
drill
gordon
was
about
to
burst
in
to
the
shop
when
rudd
detained
him
steady
man
this
is
a
great
idea
let
buy
enough
for
the
whole
platoon
it
will
be
a
gorgeous
sight
let
fetch
betteridge
flinging
prefectorial
dignity
to
the
winds
they
rushed
down
to
the
studies
betteridge
you
got
to
let
us
draw
upon
the
house
funds
for
a
good
cause
they
poured
out
the
idea
betteridge
was
enthusiastic
for
six
shillings
they
bought
forty
pairs
of
coloured
laces
at
next
morning
a
huge
crowd
lined
up
under
the
lindens
to
watch
the
school
house
parade
rumour
had
flown
round
it
was
a
noble
spectacle
each
section
wore
a
different
coloured
gordon
wore
pale
blue
rudd
pink
foster
green
and
collin
orange
everyone
was
shaking
with
laughter
betteridge
formed
the
platoon
up
in
line
facing
the
school
house
dormitories
sooner
or
later
rogers
would
pass
by
on
his
way
from
the
common
room
at
last
he
was
sighted
turning
the
corner
of
the
chief
drive
half
the
school
had
assembled
by
the
gates
private
morgan
shouted
betteridge
fall
out
and
do
up
your
remainder
present
arms
rogers
was
far
too
and
certain
of
his
own
importance
to
see
that
the
demonstration
was
meant
for
him
but
the
school
saw
it
and
so
did
certain
members
of
the
staff
who
made
everything
quite
clear
to
rogers
that
afternoon
finally
the
chief
learnt
of
the
affair
betteridge
got
a
lecture
on
military
discipline
and
on
prefectorial
dignity
but
a
good
many
of
the
younger
masters
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
rag
and
the
story
of
the
coloured
is
still
recounted
in
common
room
when
rogers
has
made
himself
unusually
tedious
about
his
own
virtues
and
his
cleverness
in
scoring
off
his
enemies
chapter
iii
romance
the
tonford
match
was
a
sad
travesty
of
fernhurst
football
the
school
lost
by
over
forty
points
gordon
got
his
seconds
in
company
with
nearly
the
entire
fifteen
he
was
not
very
elated
these
things
had
lost
their
value
still
it
was
as
well
to
have
them
the
school
authorities
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
expense
of
travelling
was
too
great
during
and
the
dulbridge
match
was
scratched
the
fifteen
continued
to
play
uppers
there
was
nothing
to
train
for
there
was
no
chance
of
there
being
any
matches
but
the
same
routine
went
on
it
was
in
this
period
of
depression
that
gordon
began
to
take
an
interest
in
morcombe
morcombe
was
considerably
gordon
junior
not
so
much
in
years
there
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
a
few
months
between
them
as
in
position
morcombe
had
come
late
had
made
little
mark
at
either
footer
or
cricket
and
had
drifted
into
the
army
class
where
owing
to
private
tuition
and
extra
hours
he
found
himself
somewhat
out
of
it
in
the
house
in
hall
he
used
to
sit
at
the
top
of
the
table
gordon
very
rarely
took
hall
he
generally
managed
to
find
someone
to
assume
the
duty
for
him
but
one
day
everyone
seemed
engaged
on
some
pursuit
or
other
so
with
every
anticipation
of
a
dull
evening
he
went
down
to
hall
he
began
to
read
shelley
but
the
surroundings
were
unpropitious
all
about
him
sat
huddled
fragments
of
humanity
scratching
ideas
with
crossed
nibs
into
notebooks
there
was
a
general
air
of
unrest
gordon
tried
some
of
the
episodes
in
lepard
street
were
more
in
harmony
with
his
feelings
but
there
was
in
compton
mackenzie
prose
a
perfection
of
phrase
which
seemed
almost
as
much
out
of
place
as
as
a
last
resort
he
began
to
talk
to
the
two
boys
nearest
him
bray
and
morcombe
bray
always
amused
him
his
whole
outlook
on
life
was
so
exactly
like
his
footer
but
for
once
gordon
found
him
dull
morcombe
was
so
much
more
interesting
in
second
hall
that
evening
gordon
discovered
from
a
house
list
that
morcombe
was
in
the
army
class
he
consulted
foster
on
the
subject
know
anything
about
a
lad
called
morcombe
yes
he
is
in
the
army
class
rather
a
fool
why
oh
nothing
i
was
talking
to
him
in
hall
he
did
seem
so
bad
perhaps
he
is
i
have
taken
much
interest
in
him
i
see
gordon
returned
to
his
book
five
minutes
later
he
began
again
is
morcombe
fairly
high
in
form
not
very
why
this
sudden
interest
nothing
foster
looked
at
him
for
a
second
then
burst
out
laughing
what
the
hell
the
matter
with
you
said
gordon
oh
nothing
gordon
looked
fierce
and
returned
once
more
to
the
history
of
michael
fane
two
nights
later
gordon
came
into
his
study
to
find
morcombe
sitting
with
foster
preparing
some
con
hope
you
do
mind
me
bringing
this
lad
in
said
foster
i
am
in
great
difficulties
with
some
con
gordon
grunted
and
proceeded
to
bury
himself
in
pot
of
i
say
caruthers
broke
in
foster
you
might
help
us
with
this
vergil
it
got
us
licked
here
you
are
look
senex
gordon
went
through
the
familiar
passage
with
comparative
ease
there
now
you
see
said
foster
there
some
use
in
these
sixth
form
slackers
after
all
by
the
way
what
did
you
think
of
claremont
sermon
last
night
conversation
flowed
easily
morcombe
was
quick
and
at
times
amusing
gordon
unaccountably
found
himself
trying
to
appear
at
his
best
you
know
he
was
saying
i
do
get
so
sick
of
these
masters
who
go
about
with
the
theory
of
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
and
in
too
with
all
these
men
falling
and
no
advance
being
made
from
day
to
day
yes
said
morcombe
i
agree
with
the
good
but
much
less
good
than
ill
philosophy
gordon
was
surprised
out
of
himself
i
should
have
thought
you
had
read
the
we
are
not
all
philistines
you
know
thus
began
a
friendship
entirely
different
from
any
gordon
had
known
before
he
did
not
know
what
his
real
sentiments
were
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
analyse
them
he
only
knew
that
when
he
was
with
morcombe
he
was
indescribably
happy
there
was
something
in
him
so
natural
so
unaffected
so
sensitive
to
beauty
after
this
morcombe
came
up
to
gordon
study
nearly
every
evening
and
usually
foster
left
them
alone
together
and
went
off
in
search
of
collins
indeed
this
friendship
coupled
with
his
admiration
for
ferrers
was
all
that
kept
gordon
from
wild
excesses
during
the
dark
december
days
and
the
drear
opening
weeks
of
the
easter
term
during
the
long
morning
hours
when
gordon
was
supposed
to
be
reading
history
more
than
once
there
came
over
him
a
wish
to
plunge
himself
into
the
feverish
waters
of
pleasure
and
forget
for
a
while
the
doubts
and
disappointments
that
overhung
everything
in
his
life
at
times
he
would
sit
in
the
big
when
the
school
was
changing
and
as
he
saw
the
sea
of
faces
of
those
some
big
some
small
who
had
drifted
with
the
stream
and
had
soon
forgotten
early
resolutions
and
principles
in
the
conveniently
broadminded
atmosphere
of
a
certain
side
of
public
school
life
he
realised
how
easily
he
could
slip
into
that
life
and
be
engulfed
no
one
would
mind
his
position
would
be
the
same
no
one
would
think
worse
of
him
unless
of
course
he
was
caught
then
probably
everyone
would
turn
round
upon
him
that
was
the
one
unforgivable
sin
to
be
found
out
but
it
was
rarely
that
anyone
was
caught
and
the
descent
was
so
easy
in
his
excitement
he
might
perhaps
forget
a
little
and
then
perhaps
ferrers
would
come
rushing
up
to
his
study
aglow
with
health
and
clean
fresh
existence
and
he
would
talk
of
books
and
poetry
and
life
and
systems
and
gordon
would
realise
the
ugliness
of
his
own
misgivings
when
set
beside
the
noble
idealism
of
art
ferrers
was
not
a
preacher
he
never
lectured
anyone
he
believed
in
setting
boys
high
ideals
we
needs
must
love
the
highest
when
we
see
it
and
during
these
months
his
influence
on
gordon
was
tremendous
then
when
the
long
evenings
came
with
morcombe
sitting
in
the
games
study
his
face
flushed
with
the
glow
of
the
leaping
fire
talking
of
keats
and
shelley
himself
a
poem
gordon
used
to
wonder
how
he
could
ever
have
wished
to
dabble
in
ugly
things
out
of
his
cowardice
to
face
the
truth
those
evenings
were
in
fact
the
brightest
of
his
fernhurst
days
their
happiness
was
unsubstantial
inexplicable
incomprehensible
but
none
the
less
a
real
happiness
they
vanished
however
and
the
day
would
begin
again
with
the
lonely
hours
of
morning
school
when
gordon
realised
once
more
the
emptiness
of
his
position
and
how
hopelessly
he
had
failed
to
do
any
of
the
things
he
had
set
out
to
do
the
state
of
affairs
was
summed
up
by
archie
fletcher
in
the
last
week
of
the
christmas
term
this
place
is
simply
ghastly
all
the
best
fellows
have
gone
he
said
next
term
we
shall
have
rudd
head
of
the
house
all
the
young
masters
have
gone
and
we
are
left
with
fossils
fretting
because
they
are
too
old
to
fight
and
making
our
lives
unbearable
because
we
are
too
young
as
soon
as
i
am
old
enough
i
mean
to
go
and
fight
but
i
ca
stick
the
way
these
masters
croak
away
about
the
trenches
all
day
long
if
you
play
badly
at
rugger
you
are
asked
what
use
you
will
be
in
a
regiment
if
your
french
prose
is
full
of
howlers
you
are
told
that
slackers
are
wanted
in
the
trenches
damn
it
all
we
know
that
all
these
who
are
now
fighting
in
france
slacked
at
work
and
cribbed
and
they
were
all
in
the
fifteen
and
splendid
men
they
are
too
fernhurst
is
what
it
was
last
term
we
had
a
set
of
chaps
and
i
loved
fernhurst
but
i
am
not
going
to
stick
here
now
i
am
going
back
home
till
i
am
eighteen
then
i
go
and
fight
this
is
no
place
for
me
it
was
the
requiem
of
all
the
old
dreams
and
gordon
knew
it
for
his
own
as
well
during
the
christmas
holidays
gordon
tried
to
forget
as
far
as
possible
fernhurst
and
all
that
fernhurst
stood
for
more
and
more
he
found
himself
turning
for
consolation
to
the
poets
but
now
it
was
to
different
poets
that
he
turned
the
of
byron
the
rebel
flag
of
swinburne
lost
their
hold
over
him
he
himself
was
so
entangled
in
strife
that
he
wanted
soothing
companions
in
the
poetry
of
ernest
dowson
he
read
something
of
his
own
failure
to
realise
the
things
he
had
hoped
for
rolling
like
a
stream
through
valleys
and
wooden
plains
carried
him
outside
the
hoarse
babble
of
voices
lulled
him
into
a
temporary
security
with
its
abundance
of
perfect
imagery
he
discovered
the
poetry
bookshop
in
devonshire
street
and
went
there
for
the
evening
readings
there
was
a
perfect
serenity
in
the
small
room
at
the
top
of
the
wooden
stairs
with
the
dark
blue
curtains
the
intent
faces
the
dim
shaded
lights
the
low
voice
reading
he
wished
that
thus
in
some
monastic
retreat
he
might
spend
his
whole
life
in
a
world
of
dreams
and
illusions
but
he
realised
that
the
hold
of
life
was
too
strong
on
him
at
the
same
time
he
loved
and
hated
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
stretching
plain
the
spears
glimmering
in
the
sun
he
had
sought
for
power
and
position
yet
when
they
were
won
he
despised
them
the
future
was
impenetrable
but
he
returned
for
the
easter
term
determined
to
do
his
duty
by
the
house
however
much
he
might
disappoint
himself
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
term
the
bull
called
him
up
you
remember
he
began
there
was
some
talk
last
year
about
altering
the
conditions
of
the
three
cock
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
in
every
way
if
we
could
come
to
some
arrangement
by
which
you
should
play
against
two
houses
instead
of
three
conditions
are
so
very
changed
when
the
match
was
started
you
had
ninety
boys
and
each
outhouse
had
thirty
now
you
have
under
seventy
and
each
outhouse
over
it
is
ten
years
now
since
you
won
and
it
is
a
pity
it
is
not
more
of
a
game
your
men
ca
enjoy
it
and
i
know
mine
do
what
do
you
think
i
think
we
would
all
rather
go
on
as
we
are
at
present
sir
but
do
you
see
how
hard
it
is
for
you
ever
to
win
yes
sir
and
it
is
also
rather
hard
for
us
to
accept
charity
of
course
i
ca
force
anything
on
you
it
is
a
matter
for
you
to
decide
but
it
does
seem
a
pity
to
make
a
match
like
the
three
cock
a
permanent
farce
merely
because
you
are
too
proud
to
see
that
you
take
on
the
whole
school
we
discuss
the
matter
at
the
end
of
the
term
again
when
the
house
learnt
of
this
interview
it
raged
furiously
confounded
insolence
calling
it
a
farce
said
foster
and
after
all
we
stand
a
chance
of
winning
heavens
we
will
boot
them
to
blazes
everyone
in
the
school
house
considered
the
idea
of
a
change
preposterous
gordon
alone
realised
that
the
present
was
an
impossible
state
of
affairs
against
a
hundred
and
twenty
they
hope
to
win
more
than
once
in
six
years
he
pointed
this
out
to
morcombe
in
second
hall
that
evening
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
we
win
this
year
i
believe
i
shall
go
to
bull
and
offer
to
change
it
but
why
said
morcombe
there
are
times
when
i
ca
understand
you
and
this
is
one
of
them
surely
if
we
win
it
is
a
proof
that
we
are
good
enough
to
go
on
playing
why
stop
then
because
if
we
did
win
it
would
be
only
once
in
a
way
and
i
bear
to
think
of
our
giving
in
after
a
beating
by
seventy
points
it
is
an
i
would
much
rather
lay
down
our
privilege
willingly
that
why
i
admire
sulla
so
much
at
the
very
height
of
his
power
he
laid
it
down
and
went
into
a
glorious
retirement
his
is
the
most
dramatic
exit
in
history
i
should
like
the
house
to
do
that
we
have
taken
on
too
big
a
thing
we
have
got
to
give
in
sooner
or
later
perhaps
so
said
morcombe
and
i
suppose
bull
thinks
you
are
thoroughly
conceited
and
proud
i
believe
so
said
gordon
but
let
us
talk
about
something
else
as
a
whole
the
easter
term
began
far
more
satisfactorily
than
the
christmas
term
had
ended
there
were
no
uppers
house
captains
ran
everything
morgan
had
been
promoted
into
the
lower
sixth
and
gordon
found
him
a
most
entertaining
person
naturally
clever
and
naturally
indolent
morgan
work
presented
a
strange
contrast
he
and
gordon
would
settle
down
to
prepare
for
finnemore
they
would
begin
lethargically
after
ten
lines
morgan
would
ask
whether
they
had
done
enough
gordon
would
fling
a
book
at
his
head
somehow
or
other
they
would
slop
through
thirty
lines
then
morgan
would
shut
his
book
and
refuse
to
do
any
more
thirty
lines
is
enough
for
finnemore
and
besides
i
feel
rather
slack
gordon
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
point
out
that
the
same
feeling
of
slackness
overcame
him
every
night
they
would
both
pull
up
their
chairs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
waste
the
rest
of
hall
talking
the
next
morning
however
gordon
would
discover
that
the
lines
they
had
prepared
the
night
before
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
at
all
he
would
curse
morgan
and
then
go
up
to
the
library
rout
out
jebbs
translation
and
prepare
the
greek
then
he
would
move
across
to
school
with
the
contented
feeling
of
work
well
done
morgan
would
be
put
on
to
con
gordon
would
wait
laughing
to
himself
he
was
sure
morgan
would
make
an
awful
mess
of
things
but
somehow
or
other
morgan
always
managed
to
translate
it
correctly
if
not
stylishly
morgan
you
did
that
again
when
i
was
there
gordon
would
say
afterwards
oh
no
we
prepared
it
pretty
well
last
night
for
a
change
after
a
while
gordon
got
used
to
this
apparent
miracle
but
he
himself
had
invariably
to
consult
the
english
authority
he
did
not
tell
morgan
that
the
climax
was
reached
when
finnemore
who
liked
gordon
and
thought
him
rather
clever
wrote
in
morgan
report
he
relies
rather
too
much
on
caruther
help
for
his
sophocles
translation
it
was
an
interpretation
that
had
occurred
to
neither
chapter
iv
the
dawn
of
nothing
slowly
the
easter
term
moved
on
as
the
days
went
by
the
sense
of
failure
which
had
overhung
everything
gordon
had
done
the
term
before
returned
with
an
increased
poignancy
the
thirds
ended
in
a
defeat
which
was
rendered
no
more
pleasant
by
the
fact
that
it
was
inevitable
no
one
expected
the
house
to
win
the
defeat
was
no
reflection
on
leadership
the
chief
in
fact
said
to
him
we
were
much
too
small
a
side
caruthers
but
i
think
we
put
up
a
plucky
fight
you
anything
to
grumble
at
we
did
much
better
than
i
expected
but
gordon
was
always
too
prone
to
judge
by
results
he
contrasted
the
game
with
last
year
triumphs
and
with
the
glorious
defeat
of
the
year
before
which
had
brought
more
honour
than
many
victories
it
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
hoped
for
there
would
not
be
much
to
remember
his
captaincy
by
one
morning
towards
the
middle
of
february
he
was
glancing
down
the
casualty
list
when
he
saw
jeffries
name
among
those
killed
he
put
the
paper
down
and
walked
very
quietly
across
to
his
study
jeffries
was
well
out
of
it
perhaps
but
still
gordon
wished
he
could
have
seen
him
once
more
that
last
terrible
scene
in
study
rose
before
his
eyes
he
could
almost
hear
the
bang
of
the
chief
door
and
now
jeffries
was
dead
and
no
one
would
care
a
master
perhaps
might
notice
his
name
and
say
just
as
well
he
would
have
made
a
mess
of
his
life
they
had
never
known
jeffries
you
look
rather
upset
this
morning
murmured
morgan
from
a
corner
of
the
room
gordon
had
not
noticed
him
i
am
rather
a
chap
who
had
a
study
with
me
jeffries
he
is
in
the
casualty
list
this
morning
jeffries
yes
but
you
did
know
him
did
you
oh
no
but
i
saw
his
photo
in
a
winning
thirds
group
yes
that
would
be
him
he
was
a
fine
forward
gordon
was
glad
to
think
that
that
was
what
his
friend
was
remembered
for
only
the
good
remained
it
was
as
jeffries
would
have
wished
the
two
cock
drew
near
there
had
been
a
good
chance
of
winning
once
but
influenza
had
played
havoc
with
the
side
gordon
told
them
they
were
going
to
win
encouraged
them
presented
a
smiling
face
but
his
heart
was
heavy
he
saw
another
cup
going
to
join
the
silver
regiment
on
the
buller
sideboard
he
had
never
found
life
quite
so
hard
before
only
morgan
unshatterable
optimism
ferrer
volcanic
energy
and
his
own
friendship
for
morcombe
made
things
bearable
at
all
and
yet
he
had
all
the
things
he
had
once
wanted
now
betteridge
had
left
he
was
indisputably
the
big
man
in
the
house
rudd
was
a
broken
reed
at
last
he
began
to
see
that
the
mere
trappings
of
power
might
deceive
the
world
but
not
their
wearer
a
week
before
the
two
cock
tester
paid
an
unexpected
visit
he
was
full
of
vitality
and
exuberance
he
was
just
the
same
debonair
thoroughly
happy
everyone
was
pleased
to
see
him
he
was
pleased
to
see
everyone
he
was
almost
hilarious
but
as
gordon
watched
him
carefully
his
mirth
seemed
like
that
of
byron
in
laughter
through
his
tears
the
others
did
not
notice
because
they
had
never
known
tester
just
after
prayers
he
met
tester
on
his
way
back
from
supper
with
the
chief
hullo
i
have
been
looking
for
you
he
said
come
for
a
stroll
round
the
courts
well
said
tester
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
earshot
what
do
you
make
of
it
pretty
awful
yes
i
suppose
you
have
seen
a
good
many
ideals
go
tumbling
down
all
our
generation
has
been
sacrificed
of
course
it
is
inevitable
but
it
is
rather
hard
the
older
men
have
seen
some
of
their
hopes
realised
we
shall
see
none
i
do
know
when
this
war
will
end
not
just
yet
i
think
but
whenever
it
does
just
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
days
of
roses
will
be
over
for
the
time
being
art
and
literature
are
dead
look
at
the
rotten
stuff
that
being
written
at
the
beginning
we
were
deceived
by
the
tinsel
of
war
romance
dies
hard
but
we
know
now
we
done
with
fairy
tales
there
is
nothing
glorious
in
war
no
good
can
come
of
it
it
bloody
utterly
bloody
i
know
it
inevitable
but
that
no
excuse
so
are
rape
theft
murder
it
a
bloody
business
oh
caruthers
my
boy
the
world
will
be
jolly
philistine
the
next
few
years
commercialism
will
be
made
a
god
do
you
mean
there
is
going
to
be
nothing
for
us
after
the
war
said
gordon
not
for
you
or
me
for
the
masses
perhaps
no
one
can
go
through
this
without
having
his
senses
dulled
his
individuality
knocked
out
of
him
it
will
take
at
least
twenty
years
to
recover
what
we
have
lost
and
there
wo
be
much
fire
left
in
you
and
me
by
then
oh
i
can
tell
you
i
am
frightened
of
what
coming
after
i
ca
face
it
of
course
there
may
be
a
great
revival
some
day
do
you
remember
what
rupert
brooke
said
in
about
there
waiting
for
the
unborn
some
white
tremendous
daybreak
that
what
may
happen
but
our
generation
will
have
been
sacrificed
for
it
i
suppose
we
should
not
grumble
but
we
only
live
once
do
you
remember
that
day
of
the
radley
match
and
what
i
said
about
oxford
i
longed
for
oxford
i
wanted
to
begin
life
over
again
to
sweep
out
the
past
i
was
beginning
to
realise
what
beauty
meant
and
then
down
comes
the
war
and
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
have
a
chance
now
i
do
know
whether
there
is
an
after
life
or
not
but
if
there
is
i
shall
cut
a
pretty
sorry
figure
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
judgment
well
it
is
my
own
fault
i
put
things
off
too
late
but
i
should
have
been
a
different
chap
i
think
if
foster
voice
rang
out
across
the
night
come
on
you
two
what
are
you
doing
out
there
the
coffee
boiling
over
buck
up
right
you
are
in
a
second
tester
had
resumed
his
old
pose
of
indifference
he
played
his
part
through
thoroughly
no
one
as
he
danced
with
collins
up
and
down
the
narrow
study
would
have
associated
him
with
the
despairing
philosopher
of
a
few
moments
ago
gordon
looked
at
him
in
amazement
what
a
consummate
actor
he
was
how
successfully
he
kept
his
true
character
to
himself
early
on
the
sunday
morning
he
went
back
to
his
regiment
gordon
walked
down
to
the
station
with
him
i
am
going
to
the
front
in
about
a
week
you
know
said
tester
as
they
were
standing
on
the
platform
good
lord
man
why
did
you
tell
us
before
oh
i
do
know
i
did
want
them
all
unburdening
themselves
to
me
here
the
train
well
caruthers
good
luck
thanks
awfully
and
mind
you
come
back
all
right
tester
smiled
at
him
rather
sadly
i
am
not
coming
back
he
said
the
two
cock
came
and
went
the
score
was
not
very
high
against
the
house
but
it
was
a
poor
game
the
school
deserved
to
win
because
they
played
less
badly
than
the
house
but
there
was
very
little
life
in
the
game
this
may
have
been
due
to
a
heavy
field
day
two
days
before
but
whatever
it
was
the
result
was
pitiable
gordon
had
almost
ceased
to
expect
anything
day
followed
day
everyone
was
discontented
even
ferrers
began
to
doubt
whether
the
war
was
having
such
a
good
effect
on
the
public
schools
after
all
he
said
as
much
in
an
article
in
he
was
always
saying
things
in
it
was
his
clearing
ground
the
three
cock
drew
near
and
each
day
gordon
began
to
think
the
house
less
likely
to
win
he
had
watched
the
outhouses
play
and
knew
how
good
they
were
one
afternoon
the
buller
captain
challenged
the
house
to
a
friendly
game
a
very
hard
game
resulted
in
a
draw
there
was
nothing
to
choose
between
the
sides
and
in
the
three
cock
buller
would
have
claremont
and
rogers
to
help
them
there
were
discussions
in
the
house
as
to
whether
the
score
would
be
kept
under
twenty
someone
suggested
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
game
if
they
had
accepted
the
bull
offer
of
playing
two
houses
instead
of
three
when
the
day
came
the
outhouse
bloods
were
confidently
laying
three
to
one
on
their
chances
of
running
up
a
score
of
over
thirty
as
gordon
sat
in
his
study
after
lunch
before
going
down
to
change
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
actually
the
day
that
he
and
his
friends
had
looked
forward
to
for
so
long
it
was
to
have
marked
the
start
of
a
new
era
of
school
house
greatness
it
was
to
have
been
the
beginning
of
the
new
epoch
with
a
slightly
cynical
smile
he
compared
it
with
the
way
in
which
the
germans
had
toasted
der
tag
both
results
would
be
much
the
same
lethargically
he
got
up
put
a
coal
or
two
on
the
fire
and
went
down
to
change
the
game
followed
much
the
same
course
that
other
three
cocks
had
followed
during
the
last
four
years
for
the
first
half
the
house
did
fairly
well
and
kept
the
score
down
to
thirteen
to
nil
collins
played
magnificently
morgan
was
in
form
gordon
himself
was
not
conspicuous
then
came
the
second
half
when
the
light
school
house
pack
grew
tired
and
was
pushed
about
all
over
the
field
the
cheering
of
tries
grew
desultory
and
unenthusiastic
the
final
score
was
to
nil
you
know
caruthers
said
collins
on
the
way
up
from
the
field
we
should
have
done
better
to
have
only
taken
on
two
houses
yes
said
gordon
shortly
as
soon
as
he
had
changed
he
went
over
to
the
bull
study
he
had
already
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
alter
the
condition
of
the
match
once
and
for
all
it
meant
to
him
the
complete
failure
of
all
his
plans
he
had
set
out
to
lead
the
house
to
victory
in
the
end
not
only
had
he
retired
he
had
actually
surrendered
the
bull
received
him
kindly
ah
come
round
about
the
match
caruthers
yes
sir
i
think
we
had
better
play
a
two
cock
in
future
three
houses
are
a
good
deal
more
than
we
can
take
on
well
of
course
i
had
seen
that
all
along
said
the
bull
it
too
much
the
conditions
are
so
changed
of
course
we
ca
do
this
without
the
consent
of
the
games
committee
i
think
we
had
better
have
a
meeting
afternoon
you
might
tell
the
others
will
you
on
the
next
day
after
lunch
the
games
committee
met
in
the
bull
study
the
bull
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
as
you
know
i
have
called
you
here
this
afternoon
about
the
three
cock
of
course
conditions
have
so
changed
that
it
would
be
no
reflection
on
the
school
house
the
bull
went
on
gordon
sat
forward
on
the
sofa
listening
subconsciously
scenes
rose
before
his
mind
of
mansell
two
years
back
after
richard
thirds
saying
wait
till
of
hazelton
in
the
dormitory
saying
our
day
coming
and
you
see
it
caruthers
everyone
had
expected
this
year
to
a
triumph
and
here
he
was
signing
the
death
warrant
of
school
house
football
the
bull
had
finished
speaking
a
resolution
was
passed
it
is
a
lovely
day
said
the
bull
and
i
do
want
to
keep
you
in
i
expect
you
all
want
to
be
out
doing
something
gordon
got
out
of
the
study
somehow
or
other
one
of
the
games
committee
came
up
to
him
jolly
good
idea
of
bull
i
think
it
was
much
too
big
a
job
for
you
much
better
arrangement
oh
much
gordon
went
back
to
the
old
games
study
the
very
walls
of
which
seemed
eloquent
with
voices
of
the
dead
the
rest
of
the
house
had
gone
for
a
run
he
was
all
alone
his
head
fell
forward
on
his
hands
the
captaincy
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
gain
had
ended
in
pitiable
failure
it
was
the
desolation
the
utter
desolation
of
all
that
he
had
worked
for
during
those
four
years
nothing
remained
nothing
and
as
gordon
mind
dwelt
on
this
the
love
of
the
monastic
life
which
had
so
overwhelmed
him
the
holidays
before
swept
over
him
again
with
renewed
vigour
in
the
roman
church
at
any
rate
was
there
not
something
permanent
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
omnibus
that
boast
was
surely
not
in
vain
he
longed
to
surrender
himself
completely
to
fling
away
his
own
aims
and
inclinations
and
abandon
himself
to
a
life
of
quiet
devotion
safe
from
the
world
it
was
the
natural
reaction
he
had
been
tossed
on
the
waters
of
trouble
and
had
grown
weary
of
strife
in
plato
ulysses
asked
for
the
life
of
a
private
individual
free
from
care
after
battle
sleep
is
best
after
noise
tranquillity
dowson
exquisite
lines
on
the
of
the
perpetual
came
back
to
him
saw
the
glory
of
the
world
displayed
saw
the
bitter
of
it
and
the
knew
the
roses
of
the
world
would
be
trod
under
by
the
hurrying
they
rather
put
away
desire
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
merge
himself
into
the
great
silent
poetry
of
the
catholic
life
the
protestant
creed
could
never
give
him
what
he
wanted
there
was
too
much
tolerance
too
much
sheltering
of
the
individuality
he
wanted
a
complete
an
utter
surrender
he
passed
the
entire
holidays
in
the
world
of
ideas
he
read
nothing
but
poetry
or
what
dealt
with
poetry
he
tried
to
recapture
the
wonderful
enjoyment
of
that
last
summer
term
but
for
all
that
he
found
material
thoughts
stealing
in
on
his
most
sacred
moments
a
chance
phrase
a
word
even
and
there
would
suddenly
rise
before
him
the
spectre
of
his
own
failure
and
he
was
forced
to
realise
that
as
yet
he
was
unfit
to
lay
down
the
imperious
burden
of
his
own
personality
the
hold
of
life
was
too
strong
he
still
wanted
the
praise
of
the
populace
the
triumph
and
the
roses
and
the
wine
well
there
was
one
more
term
let
him
make
the
most
of
the
roses
while
he
could
in
this
state
of
indecision
he
returned
for
what
was
to
be
his
last
term
a
big
programme
of
first
eleven
matches
had
been
arranged
and
the
first
game
was
at
downside
on
the
second
saturday
of
the
term
fernhurst
won
with
ease
and
gordon
knocked
up
the
match
was
over
before
tea
and
as
the
side
had
not
to
go
back
till
six
they
spent
the
interval
in
walking
round
the
grounds
few
schools
are
situated
in
more
perfect
surroundings
than
downside
there
are
wide
gardens
and
flowery
walks
rhododendrons
were
flaming
red
and
white
a
hedge
of
gorse
shone
gold
it
was
a
roman
catholic
school
and
now
and
then
a
noble
calvary
rose
out
of
the
flowers
the
abbey
watched
over
the
place
monks
in
long
black
robes
moved
about
slowly
magisterially
gordon
went
up
to
one
of
them
and
spoke
to
him
shyly
a
wonderful
place
this
sir
yes
it
is
the
right
sort
of
place
to
train
a
boy
in
surround
him
with
beautiful
things
make
a
real
perception
of
beauty
the
beacon
light
of
his
life
when
he
is
young
and
he
will
be
safe
for
there
are
so
many
things
that
are
beautiful
and
poisonous
like
iridescent
fungi
and
it
is
so
hard
to
differentiate
between
the
true
and
the
false
but
everything
here
is
so
pure
and
unworldly
that
i
think
we
manage
to
show
our
boys
what
is
the
highest
we
fail
at
times
but
on
the
whole
we
succeed
he
looked
so
kind
so
sympathetic
this
old
man
that
gordon
felt
bound
to
pour
out
his
feelings
to
him
you
know
sir
he
said
i
have
awfully
wanted
to
talk
to
a
roman
catholic
whom
i
thought
would
understand
me
and
especially
one
like
yourself
who
has
willingly
abandoned
all
his
own
ambitions
there
is
something
very
fine
in
the
complete
surrender
of
your
church
in
ours
there
is
so
much
room
for
difference
of
opinion
so
much
toleration
of
various
doctrines
there
seems
so
little
certainty
in
rome
there
seems
no
doubt
at
all
yes
the
catholic
faith
is
a
very
beautiful
creed
said
the
old
man
we
are
misjudged
we
are
called
and
bigoted
they
say
we
want
to
make
everyone
conform
to
one
type
and
that
we
bind
them
with
chains
but
my
son
it
is
not
with
chains
that
the
holy
church
binds
her
children
it
is
with
loving
arms
thrown
round
them
the
church
loves
her
children
far
too
much
to
wish
them
to
leave
her
even
for
a
minute
she
wants
them
entirely
hers
and
hers
alone
perhaps
you
will
say
that
is
selfish
but
i
do
not
think
so
it
is
the
great
love
that
sees
what
is
best
for
its
own
love
is
nearly
always
right
but
if
you
wish
to
keep
your
own
views
to
worship
god
in
your
own
way
well
there
are
other
creeds
protestantism
it
seems
to
me
lets
out
its
followers
as
it
were
on
strings
and
lets
them
wander
about
a
little
laugh
and
pluck
flowers
in
the
certainty
that
at
the
last
she
can
draw
her
own
to
her
well
that
is
one
way
of
serving
god
and
in
the
kingdom
of
god
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
provided
the
service
be
sincere
there
are
many
roads
to
heaven
our
road
is
one
of
an
infinite
love
that
draws
everything
to
itself
there
are
other
ways
but
that
is
ours
but
supposing
there
was
a
person
said
gordon
who
really
wanted
to
surrender
himself
to
that
perfect
love
but
who
found
the
call
of
the
world
too
strong
you
know
sir
i
should
give
anything
to
be
as
you
safe
and
secure
but
i
know
i
should
break
away
the
world
would
call
me
again
i
should
return
but
when
i
give
myself
i
want
to
give
myself
wholly
unconditionally
i
want
there
to
be
no
doubt
and
i
want
to
come
i
will
tell
you
a
story
said
the
monk
i
was
a
boy
here
years
ago
and
there
was
one
boy
brilliant
at
games
and
work
whom
i
admired
very
much
and
by
the
time
i
had
myself
reached
a
high
position
he
came
back
to
us
as
a
monk
i
used
to
live
in
a
little
village
just
behind
that
hill
and
i
used
to
ask
him
down
to
supper
sometimes
and
i
remember
one
day
my
father
said
to
him
know
i
envy
you
a
lot
he
asked
said
my
father
far
as
this
world
is
concerned
you
are
well
provided
for
you
live
in
beautiful
surroundings
comfortable
and
happy
and
for
the
next
world
as
far
as
we
know
no
one
could
be
more
certain
of
happiness
than
you
the
young
monk
looked
at
my
father
rather
curiously
and
said
so
but
when
i
look
round
at
your
happy
little
family
and
your
home
interests
i
think
we
have
given
up
a
good
deal
and
only
a
year
later
that
young
man
ran
away
with
a
girl
in
the
village
and
he
was
excommunicated
from
the
church
and
yet
i
expect
that
the
whole
time
he
really
loved
our
life
best
only
the
call
of
worldly
things
was
too
strong
and
he
was
too
weak
then
what
will
be
the
end
of
me
asked
gordon
wait
my
son
i
waited
a
long
time
before
i
knew
for
certain
that
way
was
best
and
that
the
things
men
worshipped
were
vain
those
are
the
most
fortunate
perhaps
who
can
see
the
truth
at
once
and
go
out
into
the
world
spreading
the
truth
by
the
influence
of
a
blameless
life
but
we
are
not
all
so
strong
as
that
it
takes
a
long
time
for
us
to
be
quite
certain
and
even
then
we
have
to
come
and
shut
ourselves
away
from
the
world
we
are
too
weak
but
we
have
our
place
and
in
the
end
you
too
i
expect
will
so
probe
the
happiness
and
grief
of
the
world
and
find
them
of
little
value
and
when
you
have
you
will
find
the
holy
church
waiting
for
you
it
does
not
matter
when
or
how
you
come
only
you
must
bring
yourself
wholly
it
is
not
so
very
much
we
ask
of
you
and
we
give
with
so
infinite
a
prodigality
yes
said
gordon
i
suppose
there
will
be
rest
at
last
that
evening
as
he
sat
discussing
the
cricket
match
with
morgan
the
captain
of
the
school
came
in
and
gave
him
his
firsts
morgan
was
profuse
with
congratulations
everyone
seemed
pleased
it
was
the
hour
he
had
long
pictured
in
his
imagination
the
hour
when
he
should
get
his
coveted
firsts
he
himself
had
wanted
them
so
badly
but
somehow
or
other
they
did
not
mean
very
much
just
now
chapter
v
the
things
that
seem
but
the
heart
of
youth
is
essentially
fickle
and
gordon
lambent
spirit
which
had
for
some
time
almost
ceased
to
strive
for
anything
suddenly
swept
round
to
the
other
extreme
and
was
filled
with
the
desire
to
reassert
itself
at
all
costs
suddenly
almost
without
realising
it
gordon
was
fired
with
the
wish
to
finish
his
school
career
strongly
not
to
give
way
before
adversity
but
to
end
as
he
had
begun
he
would
be
the
ulysses
of
tennyson
not
of
plato
though
much
is
taken
much
abides
is
not
too
late
to
seek
a
newer
world
like
a
tiger
he
looked
round
growling
for
his
prey
and
his
opportunity
was
not
slow
in
coming
ferrers
was
sitting
in
his
study
one
afternoon
talking
very
despondently
about
the
general
atmosphere
at
fernhurst
it
is
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
he
said
in
fact
it
is
quite
the
reverse
the
young
masters
are
gone
the
bloods
are
gone
the
new
leaders
are
not
sure
of
their
feet
and
these
old
pedants
have
taken
their
chance
of
getting
back
their
old
power
and
the
whole
school
is
discontented
fed
up
no
keenness
anywhere
the
masters
tell
them
you
are
good
at
games
you
be
useless
in
the
trenches
wretched
boys
begin
to
believe
them
they
think
they
are
wrong
when
really
they
are
just
beginning
to
see
the
light
they
are
beginning
to
look
at
games
as
they
are
there
no
glory
attached
to
them
now
no
true
victories
glamour
is
all
removed
they
see
games
as
they
are
see
the
things
they
have
been
worshipping
all
these
years
but
the
masters
tell
them
games
are
right
they
are
wrong
it
is
their
duty
to
do
as
others
did
before
them
oh
i
wish
we
could
smash
those
cracked
red
spectacles
through
which
every
public
school
boy
is
forced
to
look
at
life
but
ca
we
sir
it
would
be
no
good
they
would
believe
you
i
am
getting
sick
for
years
i
have
been
shouting
out
and
trying
to
prove
to
them
wrong
they
wo
believe
they
are
blind
and
it
is
the
masters
fault
curse
them
there
they
sit
talking
and
doing
nothing
i
begin
to
worship
that
man
i
forget
his
name
who
said
who
can
do
those
who
ca
teach
it
sums
up
our
modern
education
it
is
all
hypocrisy
and
show
but
sir
said
gordon
we
ca
do
much
but
let
do
what
we
can
now
when
the
glamour
has
fallen
off
athleticism
let
show
the
school
what
wretched
things
they
have
been
serving
so
long
if
we
can
in
any
way
put
a
check
on
this
nonsense
now
if
in
fernhurst
only
we
shall
be
doing
something
after
the
war
we
shall
have
a
fine
fifteen
winning
matches
and
the
school
will
feel
its
feet
we
must
stop
it
now
now
when
there
is
no
glamour
when
the
school
is
tired
of
endless
and
sick
of
the
whole
business
now
the
time
yes
but
how
this
sort
of
thing
does
happen
in
a
night
i
know
but
we
can
sow
the
seeds
now
the
stoics
is
the
thing
we
can
have
a
debate
on
the
of
athletics
and
heavens
i
bet
the
whole
house
will
vote
against
them
the
house
is
sick
of
it
all
we
carry
the
motion
we
get
the
best
men
to
speak
we
give
sound
arguments
then
we
have
formed
a
precedent
it
will
appear
in
the
school
magazine
that
the
stoics
the
representative
society
of
fernhurst
thought
has
decided
that
the
blind
worship
of
games
is
harmful
it
will
make
the
school
think
it
a
start
sir
it
a
start
you
are
right
caruthers
you
are
right
we
flutter
the
philistine
dovecots
gordon
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
the
success
of
the
scheme
he
himself
was
at
the
very
summit
of
his
power
he
had
been
making
scores
for
the
eleven
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
skill
he
was
almost
certain
for
the
batting
cup
his
influence
was
not
to
be
discounted
he
could
get
the
house
to
vote
as
he
wanted
he
was
sure
of
it
he
told
davenport
of
the
scheme
and
he
also
was
enthusiastic
by
jove
that
excellent
it
about
time
the
school
realised
that
caps
and
pots
are
not
the
alpha
and
omega
of
our
existence
the
air
was
full
of
the
din
of
onset
nearly
the
whole
house
attended
the
meeting
and
the
outhouses
rolled
up
in
good
numbers
more
out
of
curiosity
than
anything
else
they
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
silly
there
had
been
a
debate
more
than
two
years
back
on
whether
games
should
be
compulsory
only
six
had
voted
against
compulsion
the
bull
remembered
this
and
came
to
the
debate
strong
in
his
faith
in
the
past
he
wanted
to
see
this
upstart
ferrers
squashed
ferrers
himself
opened
the
discussion
with
typical
exuberance
how
much
longer
he
finished
are
we
going
to
waste
our
time
our
energy
our
force
on
kicking
a
football
we
have
no
strength
for
anything
else
and
all
the
time
while
germany
has
been
plotting
against
us
piling
up
armaments
we
have
been
cheering
on
chelsea
and
west
ham
united
look
at
the
result
we
were
not
prepared
we
are
only
just
getting
ready
now
and
why
because
we
had
wasted
our
time
on
trivial
things
instead
of
things
that
mattered
and
unless
we
turn
away
from
all
this
truck
trash
and
cant
about
athleticism
england
is
not
going
to
stand
for
anything
worth
having
he
sat
down
amid
tempestuous
applause
the
audience
were
really
excited
they
had
gradually
grown
sick
of
games
during
the
last
two
terms
and
now
apparently
they
had
the
best
authority
for
doing
so
everyone
likes
being
congratulated
the
opposition
suffered
in
having
burgess
to
support
them
we
have
heard
of
him
before
years
had
not
altered
him
much
he
was
the
same
conceited
puppet
as
of
old
people
got
tired
of
listening
to
him
there
was
a
sound
of
shuffling
a
window
began
to
bang
with
unnecessary
noise
he
sat
down
to
an
apathetic
recognition
davenport
then
made
a
very
biting
speech
against
games
the
bull
was
surprised
to
see
him
speaking
on
ferrer
side
he
was
in
the
second
fifteen
and
a
very
useful
outside
whatever
we
may
have
done
before
the
war
he
cried
and
we
did
many
foolish
things
it
is
quite
obvious
that
now
this
worship
of
sport
must
cease
let
us
hope
it
is
not
revived
we
are
sent
here
to
be
educated
that
is
to
have
our
minds
trained
instead
of
that
we
have
our
bodies
developed
our
minds
starved
we
play
footer
in
the
afternoon
we
have
gym
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
other
experiments
in
voluntary
compulsion
such
as
puntabouts
after
breakfast
the
result
is
we
work
at
our
play
and
play
at
our
work
he
elaborated
the
scheme
in
an
amusing
way
there
was
a
lot
of
laughter
the
bull
looked
fierce
rudd
who
had
for
a
rag
insisted
on
speaking
for
the
opposition
discoursed
on
the
value
of
sana
in
corpore
everyone
shrieked
with
laughter
he
finished
up
thus
well
look
at
me
i
am
the
fellow
in
the
school
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
rudd
had
nearly
been
deprived
of
his
position
of
school
prefect
for
doing
so
little
work
i
am
also
a
fine
athlete
i
clean
bowled
two
people
on
the
and
hit
a
splendid
four
over
head
i
am
what
i
am
because
of
our
excellent
system
of
work
and
play
look
at
me
i
say
and
vote
for
athleticism
buffoonery
is
often
more
powerful
than
the
truest
oratory
the
motion
was
put
before
the
house
a
lot
of
people
spoke
all
in
favour
of
the
motion
it
was
great
fun
watching
the
bull
face
grow
gradually
darker
morgan
said
that
only
fools
and
philistines
cared
for
games
they
were
amusing
to
pass
an
afternoon
with
and
because
one
had
to
have
exercise
but
that
was
all
gordon
waited
till
near
the
end
then
he
got
up
i
must
first
congratulate
everyone
on
the
broadminded
view
they
have
taken
of
this
important
question
and
i
think
it
is
an
infallible
proof
that
the
days
of
athletic
domination
are
ended
for
after
all
is
it
any
wonder
that
men
like
benson
pull
our
system
to
pieces
when
we
have
to
own
that
for
the
last
twenty
years
at
least
the
only
thing
public
school
boys
have
cared
about
is
games
and
with
such
a
belief
they
go
out
into
life
to
find
the
important
posts
seized
by
men
who
have
really
worked
no
one
works
at
a
public
school
people
who
do
are
despised
if
they
happen
to
be
good
at
games
as
well
they
are
tolerated
it
is
a
condemnation
of
the
whole
system
and
after
all
what
are
games
merely
a
form
of
exercise
we
have
got
to
keep
our
bodies
healthy
because
as
mr
rudd
so
wisely
put
it
a
healthy
mind
means
a
healthy
body
games
were
invented
because
people
wanted
to
enjoy
their
exercise
we
all
enjoy
games
i
love
cricket
but
that
does
not
make
me
worship
it
i
like
eating
but
i
do
make
a
god
of
a
chocolate
éclair
we
can
like
a
thing
without
bowing
down
to
it
and
that
how
we
have
got
to
treat
games
some
fool
said
battle
of
waterloo
was
won
on
the
playing
fields
of
eton
and
a
fool
he
was
too
games
do
win
battles
but
brains
do
and
brains
are
trained
on
the
footer
field
it
is
time
we
realised
that
and
i
think
from
the
way
the
speaking
has
gone
the
school
is
beginning
to
understand
now
is
the
chance
to
show
that
you
think
so
there
are
no
good
athletes
in
the
school
the
eleven
rotten
and
the
fifteen
is
worse
men
like
lovelace
major
almost
worth
worshipping
because
they
were
men
they
made
athletics
appear
grand
because
they
were
such
glorious
creatures
themselves
but
there
are
none
of
that
sort
here
now
we
can
see
games
as
they
really
are
without
any
false
mist
of
sentiment
and
we
can
see
that
for
years
we
have
been
worshipping
something
utterly
wrong
gordon
speech
really
made
an
impression
after
all
he
was
a
blood
one
of
the
best
athletes
in
the
school
and
if
he
thought
like
that
there
must
be
something
in
what
so
many
people
were
saying
the
question
was
put
to
the
vote
and
was
carried
by
an
enormous
majority
the
bull
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
crowd
of
faces
that
had
spurned
the
things
he
admired
looked
as
one
who
saw
nothing
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
out
of
the
room
well
we
won
glorious
said
ferrers
yes
said
gordon
have
lit
this
day
a
candle
that
by
the
grace
of
god
shall
never
be
put
out
he
went
down
to
hall
flushed
with
triumph
after
all
there
were
some
compensations
for
everything
but
he
could
not
remove
the
feeling
that
out
of
all
the
change
and
turmoil
of
his
fernhurst
career
he
had
retained
nothing
tangible
he
had
written
his
name
upon
water
he
had
as
yet
found
nothing
that
would
accompany
him
to
the
end
of
his
journey
he
knew
that
his
friendship
for
morcombe
would
lead
to
nothing
very
few
school
friendships
last
more
than
a
year
or
so
after
one
or
other
has
left
he
thought
of
byron
line
and
friendships
were
formed
too
romantic
to
last
it
was
too
true
he
had
yet
to
find
his
real
ideal
he
was
about
to
begin
the
serious
battle
of
life
he
was
standing
on
the
threshold
the
night
was
black
before
him
he
had
no
beacon
fire
to
lead
him
he
dimly
perceived
that
beauty
was
the
goal
to
which
he
was
striving
but
he
had
only
a
vague
comprehension
of
its
meaning
he
had
no
philosophy
doubtless
in
the
end
the
roman
church
the
mother
of
wanderers
would
take
him
to
her
breast
but
that
was
a
long
way
off
yet
and
he
wished
to
bring
himself
to
the
final
surrender
strong
and
not
a
vessel
broken
on
the
of
existence
and
yet
he
had
no
true
guide
for
the
years
that
stretched
before
him
this
last
episode
of
the
debate
seemed
to
bring
it
home
to
him
more
clearly
his
life
had
so
far
been
composed
of
isolated
triumphs
and
isolated
defeats
which
had
not
yet
so
combined
one
with
another
as
to
form
a
bedrock
of
experience
which
would
serve
as
a
standard
for
future
judgments
he
had
made
merry
careless
of
what
the
next
day
would
bring
he
had
fought
with
the
bull
and
in
the
struggle
he
had
achieved
some
things
and
failed
to
achieve
more
he
had
at
one
time
prayed
for
the
long
contention
to
cease
at
another
he
had
laughed
in
the
face
of
his
enemy
flushed
with
the
joy
of
battle
gazing
back
on
his
past
he
seemed
to
stand
as
a
spectator
watching
a
person
who
was
himself
and
yet
not
himself
going
through
a
life
of
many
varied
experiences
now
plunging
in
the
mud
now
soaring
to
the
heights
but
the
incidents
only
affected
him
in
a
dull
subconscious
manner
he
had
learnt
nothing
from
them
his
school
days
would
soon
be
over
and
yet
he
felt
as
though
he
were
beginning
life
all
over
again
he
had
found
nothing
that
could
stand
the
wear
of
time
and
chance
but
still
there
remained
a
few
more
weeks
of
fernhurst
whatever
happened
he
swore
that
he
would
finish
as
befitted
a
king
samson
would
quit
himself
like
samson
there
would
be
time
enough
for
doubts
and
introspection
when
it
was
all
over
when
for
the
last
time
the
familiar
swept
him
out
of
fernhurst
life
for
ever
at
present
it
was
his
to
leave
behind
him
a
name
that
would
survive
a
little
while
nor
all
glut
the
devouring
grave
it
should
be
remembered
of
him
that
during
his
day
of
power
he
had
never
once
given
way
had
stood
his
ground
had
never
known
the
poignancy
of
the
until
now
gordon
had
never
really
quarrelled
with
anyone
in
his
own
house
all
his
encounters
had
been
with
outhouse
men
or
the
bull
he
might
have
helped
to
make
the
house
feel
independent
of
the
school
but
he
had
always
aimed
at
the
unity
of
the
house
aim
it
was
a
pity
that
his
last
contest
should
have
been
with
the
head
of
his
own
house
rudd
was
a
bad
head
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
his
dormitory
made
him
beds
and
soaked
his
candle
in
water
so
that
it
would
not
light
the
ragged
him
mercilessly
gordon
had
never
minded
in
comparison
with
rudd
weakness
his
own
strength
shone
the
more
it
made
him
so
essentially
the
big
power
in
the
house
but
things
reached
a
limit
shortly
after
half
term
when
rudd
tried
to
drag
him
in
to
help
him
in
his
troubles
and
shelter
behind
the
rest
of
the
prefects
it
all
arose
from
a
most
footling
source
rudd
was
taking
hall
and
the
usual
music
hall
performance
was
in
full
swing
bray
had
asked
to
borrow
some
ink
and
having
once
gained
a
pretext
for
walking
about
was
dancing
up
and
down
the
floor
singing
would
the
seaside
be
without
the
ladies
everyone
was
of
course
talking
now
a
certain
stockbrew
imagining
himself
a
poet
immortalised
the
occasion
with
the
following
stirring
lyric
went
to
his
little
suit
of
brown
he
could
not
find
his
cried
aloud
where
my
nurse
like
the
famous
quatrain
purple
this
poem
immediately
achieved
a
success
totally
out
of
proportion
to
its
merits
it
was
passed
slowly
down
the
table
finally
it
reached
bray
ah
rudd
he
said
i
believe
this
is
meant
for
you
rudd
read
it
and
flushed
a
dusky
red
who
wrote
this
proudly
the
author
claimed
his
work
well
er
let
me
see
said
rudd
it
is
er
gross
impertinence
come
and
see
me
after
breakfast
the
poet
sat
down
and
his
friends
showered
condolences
on
him
bray
recommenced
his
wanderings
that
night
in
second
hall
rudd
called
a
prefects
meeting
to
discuss
the
affair
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
gross
insolence
to
a
prefect
and
that
a
prefects
beating
was
the
recognised
punishment
for
such
an
offence
gordon
protested
vehemently
but
damn
it
all
rudd
if
you
are
such
a
ass
as
to
be
ragged
by
a
fool
like
stockbrew
you
jolly
well
ought
to
be
head
of
the
house
and
by
the
way
we
have
heard
this
masterpiece
of
satire
read
out
yet
i
do
think
there
any
need
said
rudd
well
i
think
there
is
said
gordon
i
am
not
going
to
see
a
kid
beaten
for
an
unknown
piece
of
cheek
read
the
thing
out
with
many
blushes
rudd
read
it
out
ah
jolly
suitable
too
said
foster
what
you
want
is
a
nurse
good
lord
man
ca
you
look
after
yourself
in
hall
jolly
ignominious
is
it
having
to
call
up
a
lot
of
prefects
to
back
you
up
fine
example
to
the
rest
of
the
house
is
it
well
stammered
rudd
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
strong
prefect
you
certainly
are
said
foster
that
beside
the
point
said
rudd
i
have
been
cheeked
by
stockbrew
and
i
am
a
prefect
the
punishment
for
that
is
a
prefects
beating
there
be
a
pre
meeting
here
at
eight
and
if
you
have
anything
to
grouse
about
go
to
the
chief
he
flounced
out
of
the
room
like
a
heroine
of
melodrama
i
do
think
we
go
to
chief
said
gordon
he
would
be
utterly
fed
up
but
i
am
jolly
well
not
going
to
be
made
an
ass
of
by
rudd
think
what
fools
we
shall
look
trotting
about
on
rudd
apron
strings
like
policemen
after
a
cook
well
what
can
we
do
said
davenport
do
why
make
rudd
look
a
bigger
ass
than
we
we
have
got
to
give
this
lad
a
pre
beating
there
no
way
out
of
it
we
have
got
to
but
if
we
let
the
house
know
about
this
a
crowd
will
collect
rudd
will
go
first
and
make
two
fairly
effective
shots
we
shall
then
proceed
in
rotation
we
will
just
tap
him
the
crowd
will
roar
with
laughter
it
will
be
damned
amusing
and
rudd
will
look
a
most
sanguinary
ass
i
see
said
foster
hat
off
to
the
man
with
the
brain
but
is
it
quite
the
game
suggested
davenport
a
stickler
for
etiquette
is
it
the
game
for
rudd
to
drag
us
in
to
back
him
up
in
this
world
unfortunately
two
blacks
invariably
make
a
white
i
suppose
it
all
right
said
davenport
no
one
else
made
any
objection
foster
and
gordon
usually
got
their
own
way
the
prefects
dispersed
gordon
went
to
tell
morgan
the
glad
tidings
the
news
was
all
round
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
rudd
was
generally
regarded
as
a
priceless
fool
it
was
sure
to
be
good
sport
then
next
morning
stockbrew
presented
himself
at
rudd
study
he
was
terribly
overcome
at
the
sight
of
so
formidable
a
gathering
he
wished
he
had
padded
no
one
had
told
him
of
what
was
to
happen
it
would
have
spoilt
the
situation
the
prefects
sat
in
chairs
round
the
room
rudd
terribly
nervous
was
perched
on
the
table
he
delivered
as
short
a
lecture
as
possible
on
the
sacredness
of
the
prefectorial
dignity
and
the
insignificance
of
the
frequenter
in
a
procession
they
moved
to
the
a
green
stockbrew
led
rudd
followed
cane
in
hand
it
was
all
very
impressive
round
the
a
green
runs
a
stone
path
a
good
many
people
were
clustered
there
there
were
faces
in
the
b
just
opposite
in
the
library
on
the
right
even
in
the
sixth
form
on
the
left
quite
an
audience
for
this
degrading
business
sighed
foster
to
make
a
roman
holiday
said
davenport
who
loved
a
stale
quotation
stockbrew
bent
over
the
chain
that
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
green
rudd
delivered
two
fairly
accurate
shots
stockbrew
stirred
uncomfortably
he
had
dim
recollections
of
claremont
reading
a
poem
by
mrs
browning
on
the
great
god
pan
and
how
cruel
it
was
to
make
a
poet
out
of
a
man
he
saw
her
meaning
now
then
the
farce
began
gordon
went
up
carefully
arranged
the
victim
coat
stepped
back
as
if
preparing
a
brutal
assault
and
then
flicked
him
twice
a
roar
of
laughter
broke
from
all
sides
rudd
shifted
uneasily
on
his
feet
foster
went
up
and
did
the
same
then
davenport
then
the
rest
of
the
prefects
the
very
walls
seemed
shrieking
with
laughter
flushing
dark
red
rudd
strode
across
to
his
study
such
dignity
as
he
had
ever
had
had
been
taken
from
him
everyone
had
seen
his
ignominy
the
next
time
he
took
hall
a
pandemonium
broke
out
such
as
never
had
been
heard
before
a
game
of
cricket
was
played
with
a
tennis
ball
and
a
liddell
and
scott
gordon
crossing
the
courts
heard
it
and
he
decided
to
clinch
his
victory
he
went
down
to
the
and
walked
straight
in
there
was
instant
silence
gordon
took
no
notice
of
rudd
whatever
look
here
you
men
you
are
making
a
filthy
row
down
here
i
heard
it
right
across
the
courts
the
chief
might
hear
it
easily
you
have
got
to
shut
up
if
i
hear
any
more
noise
i
shall
give
every
man
two
hundred
lines
so
shut
up
there
was
comparative
peace
after
this
rudd
had
ceased
to
count
in
house
politics
to
all
intents
and
purposes
gordon
was
head
of
the
house
and
the
house
regarded
him
as
such
rudd
was
generally
known
as
the
nominal
head
gordon
had
got
his
power
and
for
the
next
six
weeks
he
decided
to
enjoy
it
to
the
full
on
the
cricket
field
although
not
quite
keeping
to
the
promise
or
the
luck
of
may
he
did
well
enough
to
make
the
batting
cup
quite
certain
there
was
now
no
fear
of
any
defeat
clouding
his
last
days
he
had
ceased
to
worry
himself
with
analysing
his
emotions
he
let
himself
enjoy
the
hour
of
happiness
while
he
still
had
it
and
did
not
trouble
to
question
himself
how
long
it
would
last
he
had
passed
through
the
time
of
blind
depression
during
the
easter
term
when
he
had
seen
hope
after
hope
go
down
he
had
come
through
somehow
it
did
not
matter
with
what
inward
searchings
of
heart
outwardly
he
had
been
a
success
now
his
outward
triumph
was
even
more
pronounced
as
a
few
weeks
before
he
had
been
too
prone
to
look
at
the
inward
to
the
total
exclusion
of
the
outward
aspect
of
things
now
he
began
to
consider
only
the
things
that
seem
it
was
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
it
remained
for
him
to
find
the
the
last
days
of
june
and
the
early
weeks
of
july
passed
calmly
in
the
mornings
he
lounged
in
his
study
reading
novels
or
talking
to
morgan
the
afternoons
went
by
like
a
cavalcade
with
the
white
figures
on
the
cricket
ground
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
the
pavilion
the
shadows
lengthening
across
the
ground
then
the
evenings
came
with
morcombe
sitting
in
his
study
getting
helped
in
his
work
or
talking
about
books
and
people
and
ideas
the
house
matches
began
senior
had
an
average
side
but
no
one
expected
them
to
do
very
much
and
it
was
a
surprise
when
by
beating
christy
and
claremont
they
qualified
to
meet
an
exceptionally
strong
buller
side
in
the
final
foster
and
gordon
looked
forward
to
their
last
match
at
fernhurst
with
the
cheerful
knowledge
that
they
had
no
chance
of
winning
and
that
therefore
they
had
nothing
to
fear
of
disappointment
it
would
be
a
jolly
friendly
game
to
finish
up
with
the
days
raced
past
so
quickly
that
it
came
as
a
shock
to
gordon
to
discover
that
his
last
week
with
its
examinations
and
threatening
form
lists
had
really
come
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
you
know
he
said
to
foster
i
am
not
at
all
looking
forward
to
the
army
last
christmas
i
would
have
given
anything
to
get
out
of
this
place
foster
answered
but
now
my
lord
i
wish
i
was
coming
back
we
had
a
good
time
this
term
the
first
three
days
of
that
last
week
it
rained
incessantly
the
senior
final
was
postponed
till
the
thursday
examinations
took
their
desultory
course
gordon
had
often
in
the
past
slacked
in
exams
but
never
had
he
treated
them
in
quite
the
same
indifferent
way
as
he
did
this
term
he
had
no
intention
of
spoiling
his
last
days
by
working
every
morning
the
sixth
went
in
for
a
three
hours
paper
at
before
eleven
gordon
had
always
shown
up
his
papers
and
strolled
out
of
the
room
to
read
in
his
study
in
the
afternoon
he
usually
managed
to
toss
off
the
two
hours
exam
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
was
finishing
in
style
on
thursday
the
rain
stopped
at
last
and
the
senior
final
began
foster
said
gordon
as
the
two
walked
down
to
the
field
i
believe
ours
is
one
of
the
very
worst
sides
that
ever
got
into
the
final
there
are
two
firsts
you
and
collins
was
tried
for
the
colts
two
years
ago
there
are
eight
others
oh
you
forget
bray
a
fine
free
bat
with
an
unorthodox
style
but
i
believe
he
made
fourteen
on
a
house
game
the
other
day
yes
that
is
a
recommendation
of
course
but
somehow
i
do
think
we
shall
win
win
echoed
foster
we
shall
be
lucky
if
we
avoid
an
innings
defeat
and
this
supposition
proved
still
more
likely
when
later
the
house
having
won
the
toss
had
lost
three
wickets
for
as
many
runs
jack
whitaker
now
captain
of
buller
had
gone
on
to
bowl
first
from
the
end
nearest
the
national
schools
in
his
first
over
he
clean
bowled
gordon
and
in
the
next
he
got
foster
leg
before
and
bradford
caught
in
the
slips
i
foresee
said
collins
that
we
shall
spend
most
of
this
game
fielding
a
poor
way
of
occupying
our
last
few
days
that
where
i
score
said
gordon
the
has
no
running
to
do
and
besides
i
rather
enjoy
a
game
in
which
there
is
nothing
to
lose
no
anxiety
or
anything
it
is
a
peaceful
end
to
a
turgid
career
oh
well
hit
bray
had
just
lifted
a
length
ball
off
the
middle
stump
over
head
that
the
sort
of
cricket
i
like
said
gordon
a
splendid
contempt
for
all
laws
and
regulations
heavens
there
he
goes
again
a
lucky
snick
flew
over
the
slips
to
the
boundary
this
is
something
like
said
foster
and
prepared
to
enjoy
himself
and
certainly
bray
cricket
was
entertaining
he
treated
every
ball
the
same
he
stepped
straight
down
the
pitch
with
his
left
foot
raised
his
bat
in
the
direction
of
point
and
then
as
the
ball
was
bowled
he
pivoted
himself
violently
on
his
left
foot
and
going
through
a
complete
finished
facing
the
with
both
feet
outside
the
crease
but
his
bat
well
over
the
line
the
chief
attraction
of
this
gymnastic
feat
was
the
unexpectedness
of
it
all
no
one
knew
where
the
ball
would
go
if
it
was
hit
once
when
he
timed
his
shot
a
little
late
he
caught
the
ball
just
as
it
was
passing
him
and
drove
it
flying
past
the
head
to
where
would
have
been
the
fielding
side
was
always
glad
to
see
bray
back
and
it
usually
did
not
have
to
wait
long
but
he
bore
a
charmed
life
he
was
missed
at
point
once
twice
he
gave
a
chance
of
being
stumped
the
ball
shaved
his
wickets
times
innumerable
but
nearly
every
other
ball
he
managed
to
hit
somewhere
in
the
pavilion
the
school
house
rocked
with
laughter
at
the
other
end
davenham
poked
about
scoring
singles
here
and
there
the
score
crept
up
amid
cheers
in
which
laughter
was
blended
the
fifty
went
up
then
bray
in
a
particularly
gallant
effort
to
steer
a
ball
well
outside
the
off
stump
round
to
hit
all
three
wickets
flying
out
of
the
ground
it
was
a
suitable
end
to
an
unusual
innings
he
received
a
royal
welcome
in
the
pavilion
bray
my
son
said
gordon
you
are
a
sportsman
come
to
the
and
have
a
drink
nellie
mix
this
gentleman
an
ice
and
a
lemonade
and
put
it
down
to
my
account
thank
you
ah
there
collins
good
luck
collins
keep
your
head
two
minutes
later
collins
returned
to
the
pavilion
with
a
downcast
face
the
damned
thing
broke
he
said
as
if
he
considered
breaks
illegal
in
house
matches
the
rest
of
the
side
played
in
the
usual
school
house
spirit
there
were
some
fine
hits
made
and
some
scandalous
ones
too
it
was
like
a
cinematograph
show
everyone
slammed
about
the
men
missed
catches
galore
davenport
was
missed
four
times
in
making
fourteen
somehow
the
score
reached
respectable
heights
byes
helped
considerably
the
final
score
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
now
said
collins
we
have
got
to
field
for
two
hours
is
not
a
half
so
we
shall
have
to
field
all
the
time
we
get
a
knock
till
after
roll
on
saturday
five
hours
fielding
damn
and
it
will
do
you
a
lot
of
good
too
said
foster
are
you
all
ready
house
come
on
then
senior
filed
out
into
the
field
a
loud
cheer
rose
from
the
crowd
the
house
was
amazingly
partisan
whether
a
house
side
is
losing
by
an
innings
or
winning
by
two
hundred
runs
it
is
always
sure
of
the
same
reception
when
it
goes
on
to
the
field
from
its
own
men
the
light
had
grown
rather
bad
and
foster
began
bowling
with
the
trees
at
his
back
so
as
to
hide
his
delivery
at
the
other
end
bradford
was
to
bowl
the
start
was
sensational
buller
sent
in
crampin
and
mitchell
first
two
hefty
footballers
with
strong
wrists
and
no
science
who
had
run
up
some
big
scores
in
the
preliminary
rounds
foster
ran
up
to
bowl
crampin
had
a
terrific
swipe
the
ball
turned
from
the
bat
the
bat
only
just
touched
it
how
that
roared
gordon
the
finger
went
up
a
ripple
of
clapping
ran
along
the
side
of
the
ground
you
stick
to
that
said
collins
and
we
shall
get
them
out
by
night
dry
up
said
gordon
ironically
ca
you
see
we
are
going
to
win
man
in
jack
whitaker
came
in
he
was
far
and
away
the
most
stylish
bat
in
the
school
and
had
scored
a
lot
of
runs
during
the
season
he
faced
the
bowling
confidently
he
had
played
foster
a
hundred
times
at
the
nets
and
knew
his
tricks
well
he
played
through
the
over
with
ease
the
last
ball
he
placed
in
front
of
for
a
single
bradford
went
on
to
bowl
he
was
a
house
match
class
of
bowler
no
idea
of
length
or
direction
only
an
indefatigable
energy
and
considerable
pace
his
first
ball
was
a
long
hop
wide
on
the
off
whitaker
banged
it
past
point
for
four
the
next
ball
was
a
full
pitch
to
leg
collins
had
to
run
about
a
hundred
yards
to
rescue
it
from
the
road
bradford
looked
fierce
he
took
a
longer
run
than
usual
rushed
up
to
the
wicket
and
plunged
the
ball
in
with
all
his
force
a
howl
of
untuneful
applause
rose
from
under
the
trees
the
ball
not
only
happened
to
be
straight
but
was
also
a
yorker
whitaker
middle
stump
fell
flat
there
are
times
when
a
panic
seizes
the
very
best
side
and
for
the
next
hour
and
a
half
the
house
had
the
pleasant
experience
of
watching
an
unusually
strong
buller
side
rabbit
out
before
a
very
moderate
attack
buller
side
contained
four
first
and
two
second
eleven
colours
to
say
nothing
of
three
colts
caps
and
yet
by
six
the
whole
team
was
dismissed
for
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
the
rot
foster
and
bradford
bowled
unchanged
bradford
took
six
of
the
wickets
four
clean
bowled
it
was
incomprehensible
i
ca
understand
it
said
gordon
at
tea
bradford
was
bowling
the
most
utter
drivel
half
the
time
i
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
batting
and
you
were
not
bowling
at
your
best
you
know
foster
i
am
well
aware
of
that
but
heavens
it
was
sheer
joy
look
at
old
collins
down
there
beaming
at
the
thought
of
not
having
to
field
it
all
right
mumbled
collins
from
a
huge
cup
of
tea
by
jove
would
it
be
gorgeous
if
we
could
win
this
match
and
finish
up
by
beating
the
buller
crowd
at
their
own
game
said
gordon
damn
it
all
i
do
see
why
we
should
what
we
have
done
once
we
can
do
again
they
are
a
better
side
i
know
but
we
have
a
damned
good
shot
at
winning
of
course
buller
laughed
at
the
whole
thing
it
really
rather
funny
they
said
but
of
course
we
are
in
absolutely
no
danger
of
losing
we
could
wreck
like
that
again
and
what
more
we
should
let
an
ass
like
bray
make
so
many
runs
again
we
are
quite
safe
the
school
house
kept
quiet
they
were
not
going
to
shout
their
hopes
all
over
the
school
it
would
look
so
bad
if
they
got
thoroughly
beaten
in
the
end
but
in
the
studies
and
dormitories
that
night
there
was
only
one
thought
in
all
those
minds
that
victory
was
possible
the
next
day
it
rained
the
whole
time
the
courts
were
flooded
with
water
the
branches
dripped
with
a
tired
languor
gordon
polished
off
two
exams
with
masterly
speed
and
returned
to
his
study
saturday
morning
broke
grey
and
wet
it
rained
spasmodically
till
and
then
cleared
up
with
a
sigh
of
relief
gordon
walked
up
the
big
schoolroom
to
show
up
the
last
piece
of
work
that
he
would
do
at
fernhurst
for
a
last
composition
it
was
hardly
creditable
a
long
paper
on
the
was
finished
in
under
an
hour
but
gordon
had
ceased
to
care
for
academic
distinctions
as
he
closed
the
door
of
the
big
school
and
went
out
into
the
cloisters
he
realised
that
a
certain
stage
of
his
journey
was
over
and
done
with
for
ever
by
all
signs
of
rain
had
cleared
off
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
an
absolutely
sodden
ground
runs
would
be
very
hard
to
get
a
lead
of
meant
a
lot
on
such
a
wicket
an
atmosphere
of
nervous
expectation
overhung
the
house
everyone
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
the
match
began
directly
after
lunch
there
would
be
very
likely
some
difficulty
in
finishing
the
game
that
day
collins
and
foster
went
in
first
gordon
had
asked
to
be
kept
back
till
later
the
start
was
dull
foster
was
taking
no
risks
and
collins
seemed
unable
to
time
the
ball
at
all
which
was
luckily
always
off
the
wicket
ten
went
up
after
quarter
of
an
hour
play
and
then
foster
reaching
out
to
play
forward
slipped
on
the
wet
grass
and
was
stumped
three
balls
later
bradford
was
caught
and
bowled
it
was
gordon
turn
to
go
in
nearly
everything
depended
on
him
if
he
failed
the
whole
side
would
probably
collapse
the
tail
had
done
miracles
in
the
first
innings
but
it
could
not
be
expected
to
do
the
same
again
gordon
took
guard
nervously
he
resolved
to
play
himself
in
carefully
but
he
never
could
resist
the
temptation
to
have
a
go
the
first
ball
was
well
up
just
outside
the
off
stump
gordon
stepped
across
and
let
fly
he
had
forgotten
how
slow
the
pitch
was
the
ball
hung
he
was
much
too
soon
the
ball
sailed
straight
up
into
the
air
point
and
both
ran
for
it
crampin
yelled
out
whitaker
neither
heard
they
crashed
into
one
another
the
ball
fell
with
a
dull
thud
the
house
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
it
was
a
costly
mistake
for
when
once
he
got
his
eye
in
gordon
was
very
hard
to
get
out
and
moreover
he
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
get
runs
quickly
on
a
really
wet
wicket
for
the
simple
reason
that
nearly
all
his
shots
went
into
the
air
and
so
he
did
not
find
the
sodden
ground
making
off
drives
which
should
have
resulted
in
fours
only
realise
singles
that
afternoon
gordon
found
the
bowling
perfectly
simple
at
the
other
end
wickets
fell
slowly
but
he
himself
was
scoring
fast
a
hard
shot
over
sent
up
his
individual
fifty
and
two
overs
later
he
drove
a
length
ball
on
the
off
stump
past
mid
on
to
the
boundary
and
the
hundred
went
up
amid
cheers
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
said
foster
how
that
man
caruthers
ever
gets
a
run
at
all
he
has
no
defence
and
hits
straight
across
everything
do
let
worry
about
that
said
collins
sufficient
be
it
that
he
is
hitting
these
buller
swine
all
over
the
place
oh
good
shot
a
had
landed
first
bounce
among
the
masters
sitting
under
the
wall
the
umpire
signalled
six
one
hundred
and
fifty
went
up
and
then
gordon
mistimed
a
slow
yorker
and
was
clean
bowled
for
he
was
received
with
a
storm
of
clapping
the
house
lined
up
cheering
as
he
ran
in
between
the
ropes
gratters
well
done
shouted
foster
that
a
damned
fine
knock
to
finish
your
fernhurst
cricket
days
with
well
done
everyone
came
up
and
congratulated
him
it
was
a
proud
moment
in
some
ways
the
proudest
of
his
whole
career
a
few
minutes
later
another
burst
of
clapping
signalled
the
end
of
the
innings
the
side
had
made
one
hundred
and
buller
were
left
with
two
hundred
and
to
win
anything
might
happen
just
before
five
foster
led
the
house
on
to
the
field
the
next
hour
and
a
half
was
fraught
with
delirious
happiness
and
excitement
foster
bowled
magnificently
bradford
managed
to
keep
a
length
the
whole
side
fielded
splendidly
wicket
after
wicket
fell
victory
became
a
certainty
gloom
descended
over
the
buller
side
round
the
pavilion
infants
with
magenta
hat
ribbons
yelled
themselves
hoarse
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
in
which
eternity
seems
compressed
into
an
hour
six
came
no
one
went
up
to
tea
everyone
was
waiting
for
the
end
at
last
it
came
whitaker
who
alone
had
been
able
to
withstand
the
school
house
attack
himself
gordon
gathered
the
ball
quickly
the
bails
flew
off
the
umpire
hand
rose
a
wild
shriek
rose
from
the
crowd
gordon
last
game
at
fernhurst
was
over
his
last
triumph
had
come
at
last
samson
had
quit
himself
like
samson
through
the
lines
of
shrieking
juniors
the
team
passed
into
the
pavilion
gordon
began
to
collect
his
things
to
pack
up
his
bag
he
gave
it
to
a
fag
to
carry
up
collins
and
foster
and
gordon
walked
up
from
the
field
arm
in
arm
well
if
we
stopped
on
here
for
a
hundred
years
said
foster
we
should
find
a
better
hour
to
leave
yes
the
end
has
made
up
for
any
disappointments
on
the
way
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
have
as
wonderful
a
time
again
gordon
said
as
he
passed
in
the
sunset
for
the
last
time
through
the
gate
of
the
which
had
been
for
him
the
place
of
so
many
happy
hours
chapter
vi
the
tapestry
completed
to
gordon
this
match
seemed
the
ideal
rounding
off
of
his
career
there
had
been
no
with
him
the
best
had
come
at
the
end
he
would
not
have
to
look
back
and
compare
his
last
term
unfavourably
with
the
glories
of
yester
year
he
had
done
what
he
set
out
to
do
he
would
step
out
of
the
lighted
room
in
the
flush
of
his
success
it
was
exactly
as
he
had
wished
perfectly
satisfied
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
his
feet
on
the
table
too
tired
to
do
anything
merely
thinking
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
rudd
came
in
nervously
with
a
house
list
in
his
hand
the
chief
wants
a
list
of
the
trains
people
are
going
home
by
to
waterloo
thanks
rudd
walked
towards
the
door
but
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
he
turned
round
well
he
began
falteringly
i
suppose
you
are
jolly
proud
of
yourself
now
are
you
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
you
know
quite
well
you
have
done
damned
well
according
to
your
own
point
of
view
you
have
aimed
at
getting
the
supreme
power
and
you
have
got
it
all
right
rudd
had
lost
his
nervousness
now
he
was
shifting
his
feet
a
little
but
the
sentences
flowed
easily
i
am
a
weak
head
i
know
and
you
have
managed
to
smash
me
quite
easily
it
was
very
hard
although
you
pretend
you
are
the
devil
of
a
fellow
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
oh
not
much
only
i
want
to
show
you
how
much
you
have
done
for
the
house
you
are
big
and
you
strong
and
all
that
you
broken
up
any
authority
i
ever
had
and
you
taken
it
yourself
and
of
course
as
long
as
you
are
here
it
all
very
well
but
what
about
when
you
have
left
you
are
too
to
see
anybody
else
point
of
view
moi
le
that
your
philosophy
as
long
as
you
yourself
prosper
you
do
care
a
damn
what
happens
to
anyone
else
and
you
have
prospered
right
enough
you
have
left
a
name
behind
you
all
right
i
do
want
to
have
to
kick
you
out
rudd
said
gordon
i
do
care
what
you
say
i
going
to
finish
what
i
have
got
to
say
you
probably
not
understand
you
are
too
but
what
sort
of
future
have
you
left
the
house
order
was
kept
all
right
when
you
were
here
you
are
strong
but
when
you
have
left
who
is
going
to
take
your
place
foster
could
have
but
he
leaving
davenport
leaving
too
so
collins
the
new
prefects
will
be
weak
at
the
best
they
would
have
had
a
hard
time
but
probably
the
prefectorial
dignity
would
have
been
sufficient
if
you
had
smashed
it
up
you
say
must
rule
but
there
is
not
so
much
personality
flying
about
we
weak
men
have
got
to
shelter
ourselves
behind
the
strength
of
a
system
and
you
have
smashed
that
no
one
is
going
to
obey
me
next
term
they
know
i
am
incapable
but
they
would
have
found
it
out
but
for
you
that
what
you
done
this
term
you
yourself
have
succeeded
but
your
success
has
meant
the
ruin
of
the
house
for
at
least
a
year
that
what
you
have
done
and
i
expect
you
are
jolly
proud
of
yourself
too
you
only
care
for
yourself
rudd
finished
exhausted
and
stood
there
gasping
gordon
looked
straight
at
him
for
a
second
or
so
then
picked
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
rudd
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
for
a
minute
and
then
moved
out
quickly
what
an
ass
the
man
was
thought
gordon
the
beaten
man
always
tries
to
make
the
victor
defeat
seem
less
it
is
all
he
has
to
do
damn
it
all
a
man
has
to
look
after
himself
in
this
world
everyone
was
struggling
to
get
to
the
top
and
the
weak
had
to
be
knocked
out
of
the
way
then
foster
came
in
aglow
with
excitement
and
the
two
went
up
to
the
and
ate
numerous
ices
and
made
a
great
row
and
knocked
over
many
chairs
and
threw
sugar
about
rudd
was
clean
forgotten
as
they
rolled
back
triumphantly
just
as
the
roll
bell
was
ringing
work
was
over
gordon
wandered
round
the
studies
talking
to
everyone
in
second
hall
they
had
a
celebration
supper
for
the
whole
side
they
had
two
huge
pies
a
ham
countless
éclairs
they
sang
songs
laughed
and
told
anecdotes
they
finished
with
the
school
and
drank
to
the
house
future
success
laughing
and
singing
they
at
last
made
for
the
dormitories
but
when
the
lights
went
out
and
silence
descended
on
the
dormitory
gordon
began
to
think
of
his
conversation
with
rudd
and
as
he
thought
there
came
over
him
again
the
fierce
longing
to
get
to
the
heart
of
things
and
to
see
life
as
it
was
shorn
of
its
coverings
looking
at
his
career
from
the
spectator
point
of
view
even
christy
would
have
to
own
that
it
had
been
eminently
successful
he
had
been
captain
of
the
house
no
one
had
blamed
him
that
the
house
had
failed
to
win
their
matches
no
one
can
make
bricks
without
straw
what
did
matter
was
that
he
had
always
stood
up
for
the
house
rights
he
had
never
given
way
to
the
bull
he
had
been
strong
this
last
term
he
had
been
head
of
the
house
in
all
but
name
he
had
won
the
batting
cup
and
he
had
finished
by
playing
a
big
part
in
the
biggest
triumph
that
the
house
had
achieved
for
several
years
in
all
outward
aspects
he
had
been
a
great
success
but
gordon
had
had
enough
of
outward
aspects
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
root
of
things
to
get
on
terms
of
equality
with
life
he
was
tired
of
seeing
everything
through
flickering
glass
what
had
he
actually
done
and
when
he
began
to
sum
up
his
achievements
he
was
forced
to
own
that
most
of
them
were
athletic
triumphs
and
athletics
meant
little
to
him
he
had
long
ceased
to
worship
them
because
a
man
could
make
a
big
score
in
a
house
match
it
did
not
mean
that
he
was
in
any
way
fit
for
the
battle
of
life
and
what
else
had
he
done
he
had
carried
on
guerrilla
warfare
with
the
bull
it
had
never
come
to
a
real
head
so
little
does
most
things
are
left
unaccomplished
in
the
end
and
what
had
he
gained
by
this
contest
and
what
had
been
the
use
of
it
the
bull
was
one
of
the
few
really
fine
masters
in
the
school
he
was
a
man
and
towered
above
the
puny
pettiness
of
rogers
he
was
the
noblest
roman
of
them
all
yet
gordon
had
spent
a
whole
year
fighting
against
a
man
whom
he
at
heart
admired
it
was
of
course
the
inevitable
clash
of
two
egotisms
but
that
did
not
alter
the
facts
he
had
been
wasting
himself
fighting
against
a
fine
man
when
there
were
so
many
rotten
traditions
and
useless
customs
that
ought
to
be
attacked
but
he
had
let
them
alone
the
only
abuse
he
had
attacked
was
the
worship
of
sport
and
he
began
to
wonder
whether
it
had
been
worth
it
might
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
let
the
school
go
on
believing
in
its
gods
a
little
longer
he
had
broken
down
a
false
god
but
had
he
given
the
school
anything
to
worship
in
its
stead
better
a
false
god
than
no
god
at
all
rudd
had
been
right
he
had
smashed
through
a
garden
of
dandelions
he
had
rooted
up
flowers
and
weeds
indiscriminately
he
had
done
nothing
wonderful
and
he
had
left
desolation
behind
him
nothing
would
grow
for
some
time
in
the
plot
he
had
ruined
and
yet
he
was
a
great
success
the
world
said
only
the
superficial
do
not
judge
by
appearances
wilde
had
said
mocking
at
society
and
he
had
been
right
life
was
a
sham
a
mass
of
muddled
evolutions
the
world
was
too
slack
to
find
out
the
truth
or
perhaps
it
was
afraid
to
discover
it
for
the
truth
was
not
pleasant
gordon
did
not
know
what
it
was
all
he
saw
was
that
life
was
built
of
shams
that
no
one
worshipped
anything
but
the
god
of
things
that
seem
he
lay
supine
cursing
at
the
darkness
the
next
morning
he
woke
with
the
same
feeling
of
depression
he
looked
round
his
dormitory
there
were
seven
of
them
all
perfectly
happy
and
contented
and
why
merely
because
they
looked
at
the
surface
because
they
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
they
were
happy
in
their
ignorance
and
he
too
could
be
happy
if
he
just
took
things
as
they
were
his
last
few
weeks
had
been
so
full
of
joy
because
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
think
thought
was
the
cause
of
unhappiness
and
yet
he
had
to
think
he
hated
half
measures
for
a
certain
space
he
had
to
live
on
earth
and
he
wanted
to
discover
what
life
really
was
what
lay
beyond
the
grave
he
did
not
know
sufficient
for
the
day
were
the
day
evil
things
but
he
felt
that
he
must
try
and
plumb
the
depth
or
shallowness
of
the
day
interests
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
a
contentment
purchased
by
cowardice
yet
he
had
learn
from
tester
that
the
soul
is
man
most
sacred
possession
and
must
not
be
shown
to
the
crowd
that
he
must
always
mask
his
true
emotions
except
in
the
company
of
those
who
could
understand
them
so
he
went
down
to
breakfast
telling
collins
the
latest
joke
from
london
on
his
way
back
to
the
studies
he
ran
into
a
fag
caruthers
chief
wants
to
see
you
in
his
study
gordon
found
the
chief
waiting
for
him
you
are
not
busy
i
hope
are
you
caruthers
oh
no
sir
well
at
any
rate
i
shall
keep
you
only
for
a
minute
i
just
wanted
to
speak
to
you
for
a
second
before
you
left
everything
is
such
a
rush
on
the
last
day
i
suppose
you
have
found
that
authority
brings
a
good
many
difficulties
with
it
and
i
have
heard
that
you
have
had
a
row
or
two
but
i
think
you
have
done
very
well
on
the
whole
i
did
not
say
very
much
about
it
at
the
time
but
about
two
years
ago
i
had
very
grave
doubts
about
how
you
were
going
to
turn
out
i
must
say
that
i
was
very
nervous
about
making
you
a
prefect
but
still
i
think
your
last
year
has
really
developed
your
character
and
you
certainly
have
had
the
wisdom
and
luck
shall
we
say
like
the
host
at
the
wedding
to
keep
your
best
till
last
the
chief
smiled
the
smile
that
was
peculiarly
his
own
and
peculiarly
winning
i
must
not
keep
you
any
longer
but
i
did
want
to
take
this
opportunity
of
telling
you
that
i
have
been
pleased
with
you
this
term
though
perhaps
my
praise
sounds
weak
beside
the
applause
you
got
after
your
innings
at
any
rate
i
wish
you
the
very
best
of
luck
with
mixed
feelings
gordon
left
the
study
he
valued
the
chief
opinion
amazingly
but
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
he
did
not
deserve
it
he
felt
as
though
he
had
deceived
the
chief
if
only
the
chief
knew
how
he
had
plunged
along
in
his
own
way
an
egotist
an
iconoclast
and
then
suddenly
there
came
over
him
the
shock
of
discovery
that
everything
in
life
was
so
distorted
and
hidden
by
superficial
coverings
that
even
the
wisest
failed
to
discern
between
the
true
and
the
false
he
was
able
to
see
himself
as
he
was
to
realise
the
littleness
of
his
own
performances
yet
the
chief
who
if
anyone
saw
life
steadily
and
saw
it
whole
who
was
always
more
ready
to
judge
an
action
by
the
intention
than
by
the
result
the
chief
himself
had
not
really
seen
how
far
his
achievements
were
below
his
possibilities
and
if
the
chief
was
at
times
deceived
by
the
superficial
how
was
he
a
blundering
boy
ever
likely
to
be
able
to
come
to
a
true
understanding
he
shrugged
there
still
remained
a
few
hours
in
which
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
a
success
which
if
it
meant
little
to
him
conveyed
a
good
deal
to
the
world
outside
and
power
is
very
sweet
he
tried
to
fling
himself
into
the
atmosphere
of
rejoicing
in
which
the
whole
house
was
revelling
but
he
found
it
impossible
his
laughter
was
forced
yet
his
friends
noticed
no
change
in
him
he
was
to
them
just
as
he
had
always
been
even
morcombe
who
was
to
him
more
than
other
friends
had
failed
to
understand
it
must
be
rather
decent
to
be
leaving
in
the
way
you
are
he
said
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
games
study
before
evening
chapel
i
doubt
if
you
stopped
on
if
you
would
ever
quite
equal
the
appropriateness
of
that
last
innings
yes
said
gordon
with
a
conscious
irony
it
certainly
dramatic
what
use
was
it
to
try
and
show
him
what
he
was
thinking
he
had
learnt
that
it
is
better
to
leave
illusions
untouched
often
in
the
past
he
had
tried
to
imagine
what
a
last
chapel
service
must
be
like
the
subject
has
been
done
to
death
by
the
novelist
in
every
school
story
he
had
read
the
hero
had
always
felt
the
same
emotions
contentment
with
work
well
done
sorrow
at
leaving
a
place
he
had
wondered
whether
he
would
want
to
cry
and
if
so
whether
he
would
be
able
to
stop
it
he
had
looked
inquiringly
in
the
faces
of
those
who
were
leaving
and
had
never
read
anything
very
new
some
were
enigmas
some
looked
glad
in
a
way
that
they
were
going
to
begin
a
life
so
full
of
possibilities
some
vaguely
realised
that
they
had
reached
the
height
of
their
success
at
nineteen
but
now
that
his
time
had
come
his
thoughts
were
very
different
from
what
he
had
imagined
he
felt
the
sorrow
that
is
inevitable
to
anyone
who
is
putting
a
stage
of
his
life
clean
out
of
sight
behind
him
but
for
all
that
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
really
sad
at
leaving
fernhurst
was
for
him
too
full
of
ghosts
so
many
dreams
were
buried
there
his
feelings
were
mixed
he
felt
himself
that
he
had
failed
but
he
knew
that
he
was
hailed
a
success
he
half
wished
that
in
the
light
of
experience
he
could
go
through
his
four
years
again
but
if
he
did
he
saw
that
in
outward
show
at
any
rate
he
could
never
eclipse
the
glory
that
was
his
for
the
moment
he
remembered
that
sermon
over
three
years
back
in
which
the
chief
had
asked
each
boy
to
imagine
himself
passing
his
last
hours
at
school
will
it
feel
the
chief
had
said
you
have
to
look
back
and
think
only
of
shattered
hopes
and
bright
unfulfilled
promises
to
the
pathos
of
human
sorrow
there
is
no
need
to
add
the
pathos
of
what
was
he
to
think
he
whose
career
had
so
curiously
mingled
failure
and
success
the
service
slowly
drew
to
its
end
the
final
hymn
was
shouted
by
small
boys
happy
at
the
thought
of
seven
weeks
holiday
the
organ
boomed
out
save
the
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
the
school
poured
out
into
the
cloisters
gordon
hardly
realised
his
last
service
was
over
he
had
been
so
long
a
spectator
of
these
partings
that
he
could
not
grasp
the
fact
that
he
was
himself
a
participator
in
them
he
felt
very
tired
and
was
glad
when
came
he
experienced
the
same
sensations
that
he
had
known
as
a
new
boy
a
physical
and
mental
weariness
that
longed
for
the
ending
of
the
day
for
a
few
hours
silence
hung
round
the
ghostly
abbey
then
tremendous
in
the
east
gordon
last
whole
day
at
fernhurst
dawned
as
far
as
the
sixth
were
concerned
work
was
over
the
rest
of
the
school
had
to
go
in
for
two
hours
for
the
exam
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
a
hot
summer
morning
overhung
everything
the
studies
were
very
quiet
gordon
took
a
on
to
the
sixth
form
green
and
settled
down
to
read
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
on
anything
but
the
riotous
wave
of
introspection
that
was
flooding
his
brain
he
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
and
putting
down
the
book
he
lay
back
his
hands
behind
his
head
gazing
at
the
great
grey
abbey
opposite
him
while
through
his
brain
ran
gilbert
cannan
words
life
is
round
the
corner
he
had
failed
he
knew
he
had
failed
but
where
and
why
then
as
he
began
to
question
himself
suddenly
he
saw
it
all
clearly
he
had
failed
because
he
had
set
out
to
gain
only
the
things
that
the
world
valued
he
had
sought
power
and
he
had
gained
it
he
had
asked
for
praise
and
he
had
won
it
he
had
fought
and
he
had
conquered
but
at
the
moment
of
his
triumph
he
had
realised
the
vanity
of
all
such
success
when
he
had
come
to
probe
it
to
the
root
he
had
found
it
shallow
for
all
the
things
that
the
world
valued
were
shallow
and
without
depth
because
the
world
never
looked
below
the
surface
he
had
found
no
continuing
city
his
house
was
built
upon
sand
the
truth
flashed
in
on
him
he
knew
now
that
as
long
as
he
was
content
to
take
the
world
view
of
anything
he
was
bound
to
meet
with
disillusionment
he
would
have
to
sift
everything
in
the
sieve
of
his
own
experience
the
judgment
of
others
would
be
of
no
avail
he
would
be
an
iconoclast
the
fact
that
the
world
said
a
thing
was
beautiful
or
ugly
and
had
to
be
treated
as
such
must
mean
nothing
to
him
he
would
search
for
himself
he
would
plumb
the
depths
if
needs
be
in
search
of
the
true
ideal
which
was
lurking
somewhere
in
the
dark
tester
had
been
right
it
was
useless
to
look
back
to
the
past
for
guidance
he
had
a
few
hours
back
asked
for
some
fixed
standard
by
which
to
judge
the
false
from
the
true
there
were
no
standards
except
a
man
own
experience
here
at
fernhurst
he
had
failed
to
find
anything
because
he
had
sought
for
the
wrong
things
he
had
at
once
accepted
the
crowd
statement
for
the
truth
now
it
would
be
different
in
his
haste
he
had
said
that
fernhurst
had
taught
him
nothing
he
had
been
wrong
it
had
taught
him
what
many
took
years
to
learn
and
sometimes
never
learnt
at
all
it
had
taught
him
to
rely
upon
himself
in
the
future
he
would
take
his
courage
in
his
hands
and
work
out
his
own
salvation
on
the
hard
of
experience
the
school
was
just
pouring
out
from
the
exam
he
heard
foster
shouting
across
the
courts
caruthers
you
slacker
come
up
to
the
he
yelled
back
and
racing
across
the
green
jumped
the
railings
and
went
laughing
up
to
the
i
say
foster
let
have
a
big
tea
this
afternoon
we
had
a
supper
for
the
side
on
saturday
let
have
the
rest
up
gordon
flushed
with
excitement
at
what
lay
before
him
he
wanted
everyone
else
to
laugh
with
him
too
an
enormous
tea
was
ordered
men
from
the
outhouses
came
down
the
tables
were
drawn
up
on
the
a
green
and
the
afternoon
went
by
in
a
whirl
of
happiness
they
rolled
out
arm
in
arm
for
the
for
the
last
time
gordon
saw
the
whole
staff
sitting
on
their
dais
serene
he
looked
at
the
row
of
faces
there
was
rogers
puffed
out
with
pride
christy
pharisee
and
humbug
superbly
satisfied
with
himself
finnemore
sat
in
the
background
a
pale
grey
shadow
that
had
been
too
weak
to
get
to
grips
with
life
at
all
trundle
nursed
his
chin
twittering
in
a
haze
of
indecision
ferrers
was
fidgeting
about
impatient
of
delay
he
at
any
rate
was
not
being
misled
by
outside
things
if
he
was
misled
by
anything
it
was
by
the
impulse
of
his
own
feverish
temperament
he
was
the
splendid
rebel
leader
of
forlorn
hopes
the
survival
of
those
antagonists
of
went
down
scornful
before
many
there
again
was
macdonald
with
the
same
benign
smile
that
time
could
not
change
as
he
looked
at
him
gordon
thought
that
he
at
least
could
not
have
been
deceived
but
had
too
kind
too
wide
a
heart
to
disillusion
the
young
and
above
all
sat
buller
a
second
garibaldi
with
a
heart
of
gold
an
indomitable
energy
a
splendid
sincerity
the
most
loyal
of
fernhurst
sons
and
as
gordon
looked
his
last
at
his
old
foe
he
felt
that
the
bull
was
so
essentially
big
so
strong
so
noble
of
heart
that
it
hardly
mattered
what
he
worshipped
there
hung
round
him
no
false
trapping
of
the
trickster
sincerity
was
the
keynote
of
his
life
gordon
would
search
in
vain
perhaps
for
a
brighter
lodestar
as
two
vessels
that
have
journeyed
a
little
way
together
down
a
river
on
taking
their
different
courses
at
the
ocean
mouth
signal
one
another
good
luck
so
gordon
from
the
depth
of
his
heart
wished
the
bull
farewell
and
godspeed
at
last
the
form
lists
were
read
out
a
titter
rewarded
position
of
the
cups
were
distributed
gordon
went
up
for
the
batting
cups
his
own
individual
one
and
the
challenge
one
that
went
to
the
house
foster
went
up
for
the
senior
cricket
it
was
a
veritable
school
house
triumph
the
chief
made
his
usual
speech
kindly
hopeful
encouraging
the
head
of
the
school
shouted
three
cheers
for
the
masters
the
gates
swept
open
the
cloisters
were
filled
with
hurrying
feet
the
last
hours
passed
all
too
swiftly
in
a
far
corner
of
the
gallery
gordon
sat
with
morgan
listening
to
his
last
school
concert
opposite
the
choir
in
their
white
shirts
and
hair
sang
the
school
songs
inseparable
from
the
end
of
the
school
year
there
was
the
summer
song
the
godspeed
to
those
that
go
the
poignant
shall
watch
you
here
in
our
peaceful
onward
some
to
renown
to
to
failure
none
if
your
hearts
are
loyal
to
to
gordon
every
word
brought
back
with
it
a
flood
of
memories
he
could
see
himself
the
small
boy
reading
those
verses
for
the
first
time
before
he
went
to
fernhurst
ignorant
of
what
lay
before
him
how
soon
he
had
changed
his
fresh
innocency
how
soon
his
bright
gold
had
grown
dim
then
he
saw
himself
this
time
last
year
listening
to
those
words
with
an
unbounded
confidence
certain
that
he
at
least
would
never
achieve
failure
visions
in
the
twilight
and
what
was
the
dawn
to
bring
the
latin
began
the
school
stood
on
their
seats
and
howled
it
out
then
came
lang
they
clasped
hands
swaying
in
chorus
the
echoes
of
save
the
shook
the
timbered
ceiling
someone
was
shouting
three
cheers
for
the
visitors
the
school
surged
towards
the
door
gordon
found
his
feet
on
the
small
stone
stairway
he
looked
back
once
at
the
warm
lights
the
that
would
never
bear
his
name
the
choir
still
in
their
places
the
visitors
putting
on
their
coats
and
wraps
then
the
stream
moved
on
the
picture
faded
out
and
from
the
courts
came
the
noise
of
motors
crunching
on
the
gravel
as
gordon
walked
into
the
cool
air
he
ran
into
ferrers
sir
you
are
off
are
you
well
good
luck
write
to
me
in
the
hols
look
you
up
if
i
in
town
if
not
he
was
gone
in
a
second
some
time
token
the
last
of
all
our
memorially
the
last
of
all
our
days
gordon
murmured
to
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
down
to
the
dining
hall
the
next
morning
there
was
the
inevitable
bustle
the
tipping
of
the
servants
the
the
promises
to
write
at
least
twice
during
the
holidays
the
promises
which
were
never
kept
here
bamford
i
say
shouted
gordon
take
my
bag
down
to
the
station
bamford
looked
almost
surly
at
being
told
to
do
anything
on
that
last
day
authority
forgets
a
dying
king
thought
gordon
his
power
could
not
have
been
so
great
if
it
began
to
wane
almost
before
he
had
gone
the
came
into
the
station
snorting
and
puffing
gordon
secured
a
corner
seat
and
leant
out
of
the
window
shaking
hands
with
everyone
he
could
see
you
be
down
next
term
wo
you
yelled
morgan
bursting
as
ever
with
good
will
i
expect
so
said
gordon
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
knew
that
he
would
never
come
back
he
would
be
afraid
lest
he
should
find
the
glamour
with
which
he
had
surrounded
the
grey
studies
and
green
walks
of
fernhurst
merely
a
mist
of
sentiment
that
would
fade
away
so
many
things
that
he
had
believed
in
he
had
found
untrue
but
he
wanted
to
keep
fresh
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
fernhurst
as
he
had
last
seen
it
beautiful
and
golden
in
the
morning
sun
the
train
slowly
steamed
out
hands
were
waved
handkerchiefs
fluttered
slowly
the
abbey
turned
from
to
blue
till
it
was
hidden
out
of
sight
gordon
sank
back
into
his
seat
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
life
and
he
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
with
a
smile
which
though
it
might
be
a
little
cynical
as
if
he
had
been
disillusioned
held
none
the
less
the
quiet
confidence
of
a
wayfarer
who
knew
what
lay
before
him
and
felt
himself
well
equipped
and
fortified
for
the
long
littleness
of
life
