waits
at

a
touch
of
black
magic
i
draw
the
wizard
circle
upon
the
sands
and
blue
flames
spring
from
its
circumference
i
describe
an
inner
circle
and
green
flames
come
responsive
to
my
words
of
magic
i
touch
the
common
centre
of
both
with
my
wand
and
red
flames
like
adders
tongues
leap
from
the
earth
over
these
flames
i
place
my
caldron
filled
with
the
blood
of
a
doe
and
as
it
boils
i
speak
my
incantations
and
make
my
mystic
signs
and
passes
watching
the
mist
as
it
rises
to
meet
the
spirits
of
air
i
chant
my
conjurations
as
i
learned
them
from
the
great
key
of
solomon
and
while
i
speak
the
ruddy
fumes
take
human
forms
out
of
the
dark
fathomless
past
the
past
of
near
four
hundred
years
ago
comes
a
goodly
company
of
simple
pompous
folk
all
having
a
touch
of
childish
savagery
which
shows
itself
in
the
fierceness
of
their
love
and
of
their
hate
the
fairest
in
all
england
great
domain
the
walls
and
halls
of
which
were
builded
in
the
depths
of
time
takes
on
again
its
olden
form
quick
with
quivering
life
and
from
the
gates
of
eagle
tower
issues
my
quaint
and
radiant
company
some
are
clad
in
gold
lace
silks
and
taffetas
some
wear
leather
buckram
and
clanking
steel
while
the
caldron
boils
their
grow
ever
more
distinct
and
definite
till
at
length
i
can
trace
their
every
feature
i
see
the
color
of
their
eyes
i
discern
the
shades
of
their
hair
some
heads
are
streaked
with
gray
others
are
glossy
with
the
sheen
of
youth
as
a
climax
to
my
conjurations
i
speak
the
word
of
all
words
magical
dorothy
and
lo
as
though
god
had
said
let
there
be
light
a
fair
radiant
girl
steps
from
the
portals
of
haddon
hall
and
illumines
all
my
ancient
company
so
that
i
may
see
even
the
workings
of
their
hearts
they
and
the
events
of
their
lives
their
joys
and
sorrows
their
virtues
and
sins
their
hatreds
jealousies
and
loves
the
seven
numbers
in
the
total
sum
of
life
pass
before
me
as
in
a
panorama
moving
when
i
bid
them
move
pausing
when
i
bid
them
pause
speaking
when
i
bid
them
speak
and
alas
fading
back
into
the
dim
gray
limbo
of
the
past
long
long
ere
i
would
have
them
go
but
hark
my
radiant
shades
are
about
to
speak
the
play
is
about
to
begin
dorothy
vernon
of
haddon
hall
chapter
i
i
ride
down
to
haddon
since
i
play
no
mean
part
in
the
events
of
this
chronicle
a
few
words
concerning
my
own
history
previous
to
the
opening
of
the
story
i
am
about
to
tell
you
will
surely
not
be
amiss
and
they
may
help
you
to
a
better
understanding
of
my
narrative
to
begin
with
an
unimportant
fact
unimportant
that
is
to
you
my
name
is
malcolm
françois
de
lorraine
vernon
my
father
was
to
sir
george
vernon
at
and
near
whose
home
haddon
hall
in
derbyshire
occurred
the
events
which
will
furnish
my
theme
of
the
ancient
lineage
of
the
house
of
vernon
i
need
not
speak
you
already
know
that
the
family
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
england
and
while
it
is
not
of
the
highest
nobility
it
is
quite
gentle
and
noble
enough
to
please
those
who
bear
its
honored
name
my
mother
boasted
nobler
blood
than
that
of
the
vernons
she
was
of
the
princely
french
house
of
guise
a
niece
and
ward
to
the
great
duke
for
whose
sake
i
was
named
my
father
being
a
younger
brother
sought
adventure
in
the
land
of
france
where
his
handsome
person
and
engaging
manner
won
the
smiles
of
dame
fortune
and
my
mother
at
one
and
the
same
cast
in
due
time
i
was
born
and
upon
the
day
following
that
great
event
my
father
died
on
the
day
of
his
burial
my
poor
mother
unable
to
find
in
me
either
compensation
or
consolation
for
the
loss
of
her
child
father
also
died
of
a
broken
heart
it
was
said
but
god
was
right
as
usual
in
taking
my
parents
for
i
should
have
brought
them
no
happiness
unless
perchance
they
could
have
moulded
my
life
to
a
better
form
than
it
has
had
a
doubtful
chance
since
our
great
virtues
and
our
chief
faults
are
born
and
die
with
us
my
faults
alas
have
been
many
and
great
in
my
youth
i
knew
but
one
virtue
to
love
my
friend
and
that
was
strong
within
me
how
fortunate
for
us
it
would
be
if
we
could
begin
our
life
in
wisdom
and
end
it
in
simplicity
instead
of
the
reverse
which
now
obtains
i
remained
with
my
granduncle
the
great
duke
and
was
brought
up
amid
the
fighting
vice
and
piety
of
his
sumptuous
court
i
was
trained
to
arms
and
at
an
early
age
became
esquire
in
waiting
to
his
grace
of
guise
most
of
my
days
between
my
fifteenth
and
years
were
spent
in
the
wars
at
the
age
of
i
returned
to
the
château
there
to
reside
as
my
uncle
representative
and
to
endure
the
ennui
of
peace
at
the
château
i
found
a
fair
tall
girl
fifteen
years
of
age
mary
stuart
queen
of
scotland
soon
afterward
queen
of
france
and
rightful
heiress
to
the
english
throne
the
ennui
of
peace
did
i
say
soon
i
had
no
fear
of
its
depressing
effect
for
mary
stuart
was
one
of
those
women
near
whose
fascinations
peace
does
not
thrive
when
i
found
her
at
the
château
my
martial
ardor
lost
its
warmth
another
sort
of
flame
took
up
its
home
in
my
heart
and
no
power
could
have
turned
me
to
the
wars
again
ah
what
a
gay
delightful
life
tinctured
with
bitterness
we
led
in
the
grand
old
château
and
looking
back
at
it
how
heartless
godless
and
empty
it
seems
do
not
from
these
words
conclude
that
i
am
a
fanatic
nor
that
i
shall
pour
into
your
ears
a
ranter
tale
for
cant
is
more
to
be
despised
even
than
godlessness
but
during
the
period
of
my
life
of
which
i
shall
write
i
learned
but
what
i
learned
i
shall
in
due
time
tell
you
while
at
the
court
of
guise
i
like
many
another
man
conceived
for
mary
stuart
a
passion
which
lay
heavy
upon
my
heart
for
many
years
sweethearts
i
had
by
the
scores
but
she
held
my
longings
from
all
of
them
until
i
felt
the
touch
of
a
pure
woman
love
and
then
but
again
i
am
going
beyond
my
story
i
did
not
doubt
nor
do
i
hesitate
to
say
that
my
passion
was
returned
by
mary
with
a
fervor
which
she
felt
for
no
other
lover
but
she
was
a
queen
and
i
compared
with
her
was
nobody
for
this
difference
of
rank
i
have
since
had
good
cause
to
be
thankful
great
beauty
is
diffusive
in
its
tendency
like
the
sun
it
can
not
shine
for
one
alone
still
it
burns
and
dazzles
the
one
as
if
it
shone
for
him
and
for
no
other
and
he
who
basks
in
its
rays
need
have
no
fear
of
the
ennui
of
peace
the
time
came
when
i
tasted
the
unutterable
bitterness
of
mary
marriage
to
a
simpering
fool
francis
whom
she
loathed
notwithstanding
absurd
stories
of
their
sweet
courtship
and
love
after
her
marriage
to
francis
mary
became
hard
and
callous
of
heart
and
all
the
world
knows
her
sad
history
the
stories
of
darnley
rizzio
and
bothwell
will
be
rich
morsels
i
suppose
for
the
morbid
minds
of
men
and
women
so
long
as
books
are
read
and
scandal
is
loved
ah
well
that
was
long
ago
so
long
ago
that
now
as
i
write
it
seems
but
a
shadow
upon
the
horizon
of
time
and
so
it
happened
that
francis
died
and
when
the
queen
went
back
to
scotland
to
ascend
her
native
throne
i
went
with
her
and
mothlike
hovered
near
the
blaze
that
burned
but
did
not
warm
me
then
in
the
course
of
time
came
the
darnley
tragedy
i
saw
rizzio
killed
gods
what
a
scene
for
hell
was
that
then
followed
the
bothwell
disgrace
the
queen
imprisonment
at
lochleven
and
my
own
flight
from
scotland
to
save
my
head
you
will
hear
of
mary
again
in
this
history
and
still
clinging
to
her
you
will
find
that
same
strange
fatality
which
during
all
her
life
brought
evils
upon
her
that
were
infectious
to
her
friends
and
wrought
their
ruin
one
evening
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
i
was
sitting
moodily
before
my
fire
in
the
town
of
dundee
brooding
over
mary
disgraceful
liaison
with
bothwell
i
had
solemnly
resolved
that
i
would
see
her
never
again
and
that
i
would
turn
my
back
upon
the
evil
life
i
had
led
for
so
many
years
and
would
seek
to
acquire
that
quiescence
of
nature
which
is
necessary
to
an
endurable
old
age
a
tumultuous
soul
in
the
breast
of
an
old
man
breeds
torture
but
age
with
the
heart
at
rest
i
have
found
is
the
best
season
of
life
in
the
midst
of
my
gloomy
thoughts
and
good
resolves
my
friend
sir
thomas
douglas
entered
my
room
without
warning
and
in
great
agitation
are
you
alone
he
asked
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
save
for
your
welcome
presence
sir
thomas
i
answered
offering
my
hand
the
queen
has
been
seized
he
whispered
and
warrants
for
high
treason
have
been
issued
against
many
of
her
friends
you
among
the
number
officers
are
now
coming
to
serve
the
writ
i
rode
hither
in
all
haste
to
warn
you
lose
not
a
moment
but
flee
for
your
life
the
earl
of
murray
will
be
made
regent
my
servant
my
horse
i
responded
do
not
wait
go
at
once
i
shall
try
to
send
a
horse
for
you
to
ferry
if
i
fail
cross
the
firth
without
one
here
is
a
purse
the
queen
sends
it
to
you
go
go
i
acted
upon
the
advice
of
sir
thomas
and
hurried
into
the
street
snatching
up
my
hat
cloak
and
sword
as
i
went
night
had
fallen
and
darkness
and
rain
which
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
curse
proved
to
be
my
friends
i
sought
the
back
streets
and
alleys
and
walked
rapidly
toward
the
west
gates
of
the
city
upon
arriving
at
the
gates
i
found
them
closed
i
aroused
the
warden
and
with
the
artful
argument
of
gold
had
almost
persuaded
him
to
let
me
pass
my
evident
eagerness
was
my
undoing
for
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
more
gold
the
warden
delayed
opening
the
gates
till
two
men
approached
on
horseback
and
dismounting
demanded
my
surrender
i
laughed
and
said
two
against
one
gentlemen
i
am
caught
i
then
drew
my
sword
as
if
to
offer
it
to
them
my
action
threw
the
men
off
their
guard
and
when
i
said
here
it
is
i
gave
it
to
the
one
standing
near
me
but
i
gave
it
to
him
point
first
and
in
the
heart
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
and
bordered
so
closely
on
a
broken
parole
that
i
was
troubled
in
conscience
i
had
not
however
given
my
parole
nor
had
i
surrendered
and
if
i
had
done
so
if
a
man
may
take
life
in
may
he
not
lie
to
save
himself
the
other
man
shot
at
me
with
his
fusil
but
missed
he
then
drew
his
sword
but
he
was
no
match
for
me
and
soon
i
left
him
sprawling
on
the
ground
dead
or
alive
i
knew
not
which
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
i
was
years
of
age
and
since
my
fifteenth
birthday
my
occupations
had
been
arms
and
the
ladies
two
arts
requiring
constant
use
if
one
would
remain
expert
in
their
practice
i
escaped
and
ran
along
the
wall
to
a
deep
breach
which
had
been
left
unrepaired
over
the
sharp
rocks
i
clambered
and
at
the
risk
of
breaking
my
neck
i
jumped
off
the
wall
into
the
moat
which
was
almost
dry
dawn
was
breaking
when
i
found
a
place
to
ascend
from
the
moat
and
i
hastened
to
the
fields
and
forests
where
all
day
and
all
night
long
i
wandered
without
food
or
drink
two
hours
before
sunrise
next
morning
i
reached
craig
ferry
the
horse
sent
by
douglas
awaited
me
but
the
had
been
prohibited
from
carrying
passengers
across
the
firth
and
i
could
not
take
the
horse
in
a
small
boat
in
truth
i
was
in
great
alarm
lest
i
should
be
unable
to
cross
but
i
walked
up
the
tay
a
short
distance
and
found
a
fisherman
who
agreed
to
take
me
over
in
his
frail
craft
hardly
had
we
started
when
another
boat
put
out
from
shore
in
pursuit
of
us
we
made
all
sail
but
our
pursuers
overtook
us
when
we
were
within
half
a
furlong
of
the
south
bank
and
as
there
were
four
men
in
the
other
boat
all
armed
with
fusils
i
peaceably
stepped
into
their
craft
and
handed
my
sword
to
their
captain
i
seated
myself
on
one
of
the
thwarts
well
forward
in
the
boat
by
my
side
was
a
heavy
iron
i
had
noticed
that
all
the
occupants
of
the
boat
except
the
fisherman
who
sailed
her
wore
armor
and
when
i
saw
the
a
diabolical
thought
entered
my
mind
and
i
immediately
acted
upon
its
suggestion
noiselessly
i
grasped
the
hook
and
with
its
point
pried
loose
a
board
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
first
having
removed
my
boots
cloak
and
doublet
when
the
board
was
loosened
i
pressed
my
heel
against
it
with
all
the
force
i
could
muster
and
through
an
opening
six
inches
broad
and
four
feet
long
came
a
flood
of
water
that
swamped
the
boat
before
one
could
utter
twenty
words
i
heard
a
cry
from
one
of
the
men
the
dog
has
scuttled
the
boat
shoot
him
at
the
same
instant
the
blaze
and
noise
of
two
fusils
broke
the
still
blackness
of
the
night
but
i
was
overboard
and
the
powder
and
lead
were
wasted
the
next
moment
the
boat
sank
in
ten
fathoms
of
water
and
with
it
went
the
men
in
armor
i
hope
the
fisherman
saved
himself
i
have
often
wondered
if
even
the
law
of
justified
my
act
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
inflict
death
but
it
is
worse
to
endure
it
and
i
feel
sure
that
i
am
foolish
to
allow
my
conscience
to
trouble
me
for
the
sake
of
those
who
would
have
led
me
back
to
the
scaffold
i
fear
you
will
think
that
six
dead
men
in
less
than
as
many
pages
make
a
record
of
bloodshed
giving
promise
of
terrible
things
to
come
but
i
am
glad
i
can
reassure
you
on
that
point
although
there
may
be
some
good
fighting
ahead
of
us
i
believe
the
last
man
has
been
killed
of
whom
i
shall
chronicle
the
last
that
is
in
fight
or
battle
in
truth
the
history
which
you
are
about
to
read
is
not
my
own
it
is
the
story
of
a
beautiful
wilful
girl
who
was
madly
in
love
with
the
one
man
in
all
the
world
whom
she
should
have
avoided
as
girls
are
wont
to
be
this
perverse
tendency
philosophers
tell
us
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
unattainable
is
strangely
alluring
to
womankind
i
being
a
man
shall
not
of
course
dwell
upon
the
foibles
of
my
own
sex
it
were
a
foolish
candor
as
i
said
there
will
be
some
good
fighting
ahead
of
us
for
love
and
battle
usually
go
together
one
must
have
warm
rich
blood
to
do
either
well
and
save
religion
there
is
no
source
more
fruitful
of
quarrels
and
death
than
that
passion
which
is
the
source
of
life
you
of
course
know
without
the
telling
that
i
reached
land
safely
after
i
scuttled
the
boat
else
i
should
not
be
writing
this
forty
years
afterwards
the
sun
had
risen
when
i
waded
ashore
i
was
swordless
coatless
hatless
and
bootless
but
i
carried
a
purse
in
my
belt
up
to
that
time
i
had
given
no
thought
to
my
ultimate
destination
but
being
for
the
moment
safe
i
pondered
the
question
and
determined
to
make
my
way
to
haddon
hall
in
derbyshire
where
i
was
sure
a
warm
welcome
would
await
me
from
my
cousin
sir
george
vernon
how
i
found
a
peasant
cottage
purchased
a
poor
horse
and
a
few
coarse
garments
and
how
in
the
disguise
of
a
peasant
i
rode
southward
to
the
english
border
avoiding
the
cities
and
the
main
highways
might
interest
you
but
i
am
eager
to
come
to
my
story
and
i
will
not
tell
you
of
my
perilous
journey
one
frosty
morning
after
many
hairbreadth
escapes
i
found
myself
well
within
the
english
border
and
turned
my
horse
head
toward
the
city
of
carlisle
there
i
purchased
a
fine
charger
i
bought
clothing
fit
for
a
gentleman
a
new
sword
a
a
breastplate
and
a
cap
and
feeling
once
again
like
a
man
rather
than
like
a
rat
i
turned
southward
for
derbyshire
and
haddon
hall
when
i
left
scotland
i
had
no
fear
of
meeting
danger
in
england
but
at
carlisle
i
learned
that
elizabeth
held
no
favor
toward
scottish
refugees
i
also
learned
that
the
direct
road
from
carlisle
to
haddon
by
way
of
buxton
was
infested
with
english
spies
who
were
on
the
watch
for
friends
of
the
deposed
scottish
queen
several
scotchmen
had
been
arrested
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
upon
one
pretext
or
another
they
would
be
hanged
i
therefore
chose
a
circuitous
road
leading
to
the
town
of
derby
which
lay
south
of
haddon
at
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
leagues
it
would
be
safer
for
me
to
arrive
at
haddon
travelling
from
the
south
than
from
the
north
thus
after
many
days
i
rode
into
and
stabled
my
horse
at
the
royal
arms
i
called
for
supper
and
while
i
was
waiting
for
my
joint
of
beef
a
stranger
entered
the
room
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
free
offhand
manner
that
stamped
him
a
person
of
quality
the
night
outside
was
cold
while
the
stranger
and
i
sat
before
the
fire
we
caught
its
infectious
warmth
and
when
he
showed
a
disposition
to
talk
i
gladly
fell
in
with
his
humor
soon
we
were
filling
our
glasses
from
the
same
bowl
of
punch
and
we
seemed
to
be
on
good
terms
with
each
other
but
when
god
breathed
into
the
human
body
a
part
of
himself
by
some
mischance
he
permitted
the
devil
to
slip
into
the
tongue
and
loosen
it
my
tongue
which
ordinarily
was
fairly
well
behaved
upon
this
occasion
quickly
brought
me
into
trouble
i
told
you
that
the
stranger
and
i
seemed
to
be
upon
good
terms
and
so
we
were
until
i
forgetting
for
the
moment
elizabeth
hatred
of
friends
and
hoping
to
learn
the
stranger
name
and
quality
said
my
name
is
vernon
sir
malcolm
vernon
knight
by
the
hand
of
queen
mary
of
scotland
and
of
france
this
remark
of
course
required
that
my
companion
should
in
return
make
known
his
name
and
degree
but
in
place
of
so
doing
he
at
once
drew
away
from
me
and
sat
in
silence
i
was
older
than
he
and
it
had
seemed
to
me
quite
proper
and
right
that
i
should
make
the
first
advance
but
instantly
after
i
had
spoken
i
regretted
my
words
i
remembered
not
only
my
danger
being
a
scottish
refugee
but
i
also
bethought
me
that
i
had
betrayed
myself
aside
from
those
causes
of
uneasiness
the
stranger
conduct
was
an
insult
which
i
was
in
duty
bound
not
to
overlook
neither
was
i
inclined
to
do
so
for
i
loved
to
fight
in
truth
i
loved
all
things
evil
i
regret
sir
said
i
after
a
moment
or
two
of
embarrassing
silence
having
imparted
information
that
seems
to
annoy
you
the
vernons
whom
you
may
not
know
are
your
equals
in
blood
it
matters
not
who
you
are
i
know
of
the
vernons
he
replied
coldly
and
i
well
know
that
they
are
of
good
blood
and
lineage
as
for
wealth
i
am
told
sir
george
could
easily
buy
the
estates
of
any
six
men
in
derbyshire
you
know
sir
george
i
asked
despite
myself
i
do
not
know
him
i
am
glad
to
say
returned
the
stranger
by
god
sir
you
shall
at
your
pleasure
sir
malcolm
my
pleasure
is
now
i
retorted
eagerly
i
threw
off
my
doublet
and
pushed
the
table
and
chairs
against
the
wall
to
make
room
for
the
fight
but
the
stranger
who
had
not
drawn
his
sword
said
i
have
eaten
nothing
since
morning
and
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
i
would
prefer
to
fight
after
supper
but
if
you
insist
i
do
insist
i
replied
perhaps
you
will
not
care
for
supper
when
i
have
that
may
be
true
he
interrupted
but
before
we
begin
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
without
at
all
meaning
to
boast
of
my
skill
that
i
can
kill
you
if
i
wish
to
do
so
therefore
you
must
see
that
the
result
of
our
fight
will
be
disagreeable
to
you
in
any
case
you
will
die
or
you
will
owe
me
your
life
his
cool
impertinence
angered
me
beyond
endurance
he
to
speak
of
killing
me
one
of
the
best
swordsmen
in
france
where
the
art
of
is
really
an
art
the
english
are
but
bunglers
with
a
gentleman
blade
and
should
restrict
themselves
to
pike
and
quarterstaff
results
be
damned
i
answered
i
can
kill
you
if
i
wish
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
really
did
not
wish
to
kill
the
handsome
young
fellow
toward
whom
i
felt
an
irresistible
attraction
i
continued
but
i
prefer
that
you
should
owe
me
your
life
i
do
not
wish
to
kill
you
guard
my
opponent
did
not
lift
his
sword
but
smilingly
said
then
why
do
you
insist
upon
fighting
i
certainly
do
not
wish
to
kill
you
in
truth
i
would
be
inclined
to
like
you
if
you
were
not
a
vernon
damn
your
insolence
guard
or
i
will
run
you
through
where
you
stand
i
answered
angrily
but
why
do
we
fight
insisted
the
stubborn
fellow
with
a
coolness
that
showed
he
was
not
one
whit
in
fear
of
me
you
should
know
i
replied
dropping
my
to
the
floor
and
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
i
i
do
not
then
let
us
not
fight
he
answered
until
we
have
discovered
the
matter
of
our
disagreement
at
this
remark
neither
of
us
could
resist
smiling
i
had
not
fought
since
months
before
save
for
a
moment
at
the
gates
of
dundee
and
i
was
loath
to
miss
the
opportunity
so
i
remained
in
thought
during
the
space
of
half
a
minute
and
remembered
our
cause
of
war
oh
i
recall
the
reason
for
our
fighting
i
replied
and
a
good
one
it
was
you
offered
affront
to
the
name
of
sir
george
vernon
and
insultingly
refused
me
the
courtesy
of
your
name
after
i
had
done
you
the
honor
to
tell
you
mine
i
did
not
tell
you
my
name
replied
the
stranger
because
i
believed
you
would
not
care
to
hear
it
and
i
said
i
was
glad
not
to
know
sir
george
vernon
because
because
he
is
my
father
enemy
i
am
sir
john
manners
my
father
is
lord
rutland
then
it
was
my
turn
to
recede
you
certainly
are
right
i
do
not
care
to
hear
your
name
i
put
my
sword
in
its
scabbard
and
drew
the
table
back
to
its
former
place
sir
john
stood
in
hesitation
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
said
sir
malcolm
may
we
not
declare
a
truce
for
there
is
nothing
personal
in
the
enmity
between
us
nothing
i
answered
staring
at
the
fire
half
regretful
that
we
bore
each
other
enmity
at
all
you
hate
me
or
believe
you
do
said
manners
because
your
cousin
hates
my
father
and
i
try
to
make
myself
believe
that
i
hate
you
because
my
father
hates
your
father
cousin
are
we
not
both
mistaken
i
was
quick
to
anger
and
to
fight
but
no
man
heart
was
more
sensitive
than
mine
to
the
fair
touch
of
a
kind
word
i
am
not
mistaken
sir
john
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
hate
you
i
answered
nor
do
i
hate
you
sir
malcolm
will
you
give
me
your
hand
gladly
i
responded
and
i
offered
my
hand
to
the
enemy
of
my
house
landlord
i
cried
bring
us
two
bottles
of
your
best
sack
the
best
in
the
house
mind
you
after
our
amicable
understanding
sir
john
and
myself
were
very
comfortable
together
and
when
the
sack
and
roast
beef
for
which
the
royal
arms
was
justly
famous
were
brought
in
we
sat
down
to
an
enjoyable
meal
after
supper
sir
john
lighted
a
small
roll
or
stick
made
from
the
leaves
of
tobacco
the
stick
was
called
a
cigarro
and
i
proud
not
to
be
behind
him
in
gentlemanly
accomplishments
called
to
the
landlord
for
a
pipe
manners
interrupted
me
when
i
gave
the
order
and
offered
me
a
cigarro
which
i
gladly
accepted
despite
my
effort
to
reassure
myself
i
could
not
quite
throw
off
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
whenever
i
thought
of
the
manner
in
which
i
had
betrayed
to
sir
john
the
fact
that
i
was
a
friend
to
mary
stuart
i
knew
that
treachery
was
not
native
to
english
blood
and
my
knowledge
of
mankind
had
told
me
that
the
vice
could
not
live
in
sir
john
heart
but
he
had
told
me
of
his
residence
at
the
court
of
elizabeth
and
i
feared
trouble
might
come
to
me
from
the
possession
of
so
dangerous
a
piece
of
knowledge
by
an
enemy
of
my
house
i
did
not
speak
my
thoughts
upon
the
matter
and
we
sat
the
evening
through
discussing
many
subjects
we
warmed
toward
each
other
and
became
quite
confidential
i
feel
ashamed
when
i
admit
that
one
of
my
many
sins
was
an
excessive
indulgence
in
wine
while
i
was
not
a
drunkard
i
was
given
to
my
cups
sometimes
in
a
degree
both
dangerous
and
disgraceful
and
during
the
evening
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
i
talked
to
sir
john
with
a
freedom
that
afterward
made
me
blush
although
my
indiscretion
brought
me
no
greater
trouble
my
outburst
of
confidence
was
prompted
by
sir
john
voluntary
assurance
that
i
need
fear
nothing
from
having
told
him
that
i
was
a
friend
of
queen
mary
the
scottish
queen
name
had
been
mentioned
and
sir
john
had
said
i
take
it
sir
malcolm
that
you
are
newly
arrived
in
england
and
i
feel
sure
you
will
accept
the
advice
i
am
about
to
offer
in
the
kindly
spirit
in
which
it
is
meant
i
deem
it
unsafe
for
you
to
speak
of
queen
friendship
in
the
open
manner
you
have
used
toward
me
her
friends
are
not
welcome
visitors
to
england
and
i
fear
evil
will
befall
those
who
come
to
us
as
refugees
you
need
have
no
fear
that
i
will
betray
you
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
i
will
give
you
hostage
i
also
am
queen
mary
friend
i
would
not
of
course
favor
her
against
the
interest
of
our
own
queen
to
elizabeth
i
am
and
always
shall
be
loyal
but
the
unfortunate
scottish
queen
has
my
sympathy
in
her
troubles
and
i
should
be
glad
to
help
her
i
hear
she
is
most
beautiful
and
gentle
in
person
thus
you
see
the
influence
of
mary
beauty
reached
from
edinburgh
to
london
a
few
months
only
were
to
pass
till
this
conversation
was
to
be
recalled
by
each
of
us
and
the
baneful
influence
of
mary
beauty
upon
all
whom
it
touched
was
to
be
shown
more
fatally
than
had
appeared
even
in
my
own
case
in
truth
my
reason
for
speaking
so
fully
concerning
the
scottish
queen
and
myself
will
be
apparent
to
you
in
good
time
when
we
were
about
to
part
for
the
night
i
asked
sir
john
what
road
do
you
travel
i
am
going
to
rutland
castle
by
way
of
rowsley
he
answered
i
too
travel
by
rowsley
to
haddon
hall
shall
we
not
extend
our
truce
over
the
morrow
and
ride
together
as
far
as
rowsley
i
asked
i
shall
be
glad
to
make
the
truce
perpetual
he
replied
laughingly
so
shall
i
was
my
response
thus
we
sealed
our
compact
and
knitted
out
of
the
warp
and
woof
of
enmity
a
friendship
which
became
a
great
joy
and
a
sweet
grief
to
each
of
us
that
night
i
lay
for
hours
thinking
of
the
past
and
wondering
about
the
future
i
had
tasted
the
sweets
all
flavored
with
bitterness
of
court
life
women
wine
gambling
and
fighting
had
given
me
the
best
of
all
the
evils
they
had
to
offer
was
i
now
to
drop
that
valorous
life
which
men
so
ardently
seek
and
was
i
to
take
up
a
browsing
kinelike
existence
at
haddon
hall
there
to
drone
away
my
remaining
days
in
peace
and
quietude
i
could
not
answer
my
own
question
but
this
i
knew
that
sir
george
vernon
was
held
in
high
esteem
by
elizabeth
and
i
felt
that
his
house
was
perhaps
the
only
spot
in
england
where
my
head
could
safely
lie
i
also
had
other
plans
concerning
sir
george
and
his
household
which
i
regret
to
say
i
imparted
to
sir
john
in
the
outpouring
of
my
confidence
the
plans
of
which
i
shall
now
speak
had
been
growing
in
favor
with
me
for
several
months
previous
to
my
enforced
departure
from
scotland
and
that
event
had
almost
determined
me
to
adopt
them
almost
i
say
for
when
i
approached
haddon
hall
i
wavered
in
my
resolution
at
the
time
when
i
had
last
visited
sir
george
at
haddon
his
daughter
dorothy
sir
george
called
her
doll
was
a
slipshod
girl
of
twelve
she
was
exceedingly
plain
and
gave
promise
of
always
so
remaining
sir
george
who
had
no
son
was
anxious
that
his
vast
estates
should
remain
in
the
vernon
name
he
had
upon
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
intimated
to
me
that
when
doll
should
become
old
enough
to
marry
and
i
perchance
had
had
my
fill
of
knocking
about
the
world
a
marriage
might
be
brought
about
between
us
which
would
enable
him
to
leave
his
estates
to
his
daughter
and
still
to
retain
the
vernon
name
for
his
descendants
owing
to
doll
rusty
red
hair
slim
shanks
and
freckled
face
the
proposition
had
not
struck
me
with
favor
yet
to
please
sir
george
i
had
feigned
acquiescence
and
had
said
that
when
the
time
should
come
we
would
talk
it
over
before
my
flight
from
scotland
i
had
often
thought
of
sir
george
proposition
made
six
or
seven
years
before
my
love
for
mary
stuart
had
dimmed
the
light
of
other
beauties
in
my
eyes
and
i
had
never
married
for
many
months
before
my
flight
however
i
had
not
been
permitted
to
bask
in
the
light
of
mary
smiles
to
the
extent
of
my
wishes
younger
men
among
them
darnley
who
was
but
eighteen
years
of
age
were
preferred
to
me
and
i
had
begun
to
consider
the
advisability
of
an
orderly
retreat
from
the
scottish
court
before
my
lustre
should
be
entirely
dimmed
it
is
said
that
a
man
is
young
so
long
as
he
is
strong
and
i
was
strong
as
in
the
days
of
my
youth
my
cheeks
were
fresh
my
eyes
were
bright
and
my
hair
was
red
as
when
i
was
twenty
and
without
a
thread
of
gray
still
my
temperament
was
more
exacting
and
serious
and
the
thought
of
becoming
settled
for
life
or
rather
for
old
age
and
death
was
growing
in
favor
with
me
with
that
thought
came
always
a
suggestion
of
slim
freckled
dorothy
and
sir
george
offer
she
held
out
to
me
wealth
and
position
a
peaceful
home
for
my
old
age
and
a
grave
with
a
pompous
pious
epitaph
at
bakewell
church
in
death
when
i
was
compelled
to
leave
scotland
circumstances
forced
me
to
a
decision
and
my
resolution
was
quickly
taken
i
would
go
to
derbyshire
and
would
marry
dorothy
i
did
not
expect
ever
again
to
feel
great
love
for
a
woman
the
fuse
i
thought
had
burned
out
when
i
loved
mary
stuart
one
woman
i
believed
was
like
another
to
me
and
dorothy
would
answer
as
well
as
any
for
my
wife
i
could
and
would
be
kind
to
her
and
that
alone
in
time
would
make
me
fond
it
is
true
my
affection
would
be
of
a
fashion
more
comfortable
than
exciting
but
who
having
passed
his
galloping
youth
will
contemn
the
joys
that
come
from
making
others
happy
i
believe
there
is
no
person
past
the
age
of
forty
at
all
given
to
pondering
the
whys
of
life
who
will
gainsay
that
the
joy
we
give
to
others
is
our
chief
source
of
happiness
why
then
should
not
a
wise
man
through
purely
selfish
motives
begin
early
to
cultivate
the
gentle
art
of
giving
joy
but
the
fates
were
to
work
out
the
destinies
of
dorothy
and
myself
without
our
assistance
arrogant
creatures
are
those
same
fates
but
they
save
us
a
deal
of
trouble
by
assuming
our
responsibilities
chapter
ii
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
the
morning
following
my
meeting
with
manners
he
and
i
made
an
early
start
an
hour
before
noon
we
rode
into
the
town
of
rowsley
and
halted
at
the
peacock
for
dinner
when
we
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
we
saw
three
ladies
warmly
wrapped
in
rich
furs
leave
a
ponderous
coach
and
walk
to
the
inn
door
which
they
entered
one
of
them
was
an
elderly
lady
whom
i
recognized
as
my
cousin
lady
dorothy
crawford
sister
to
sir
george
vernon
the
second
was
a
tall
beautiful
girl
with
an
exquisite
complexion
and
a
wonderful
crown
of
fluffy
red
hair
which
encircled
her
head
like
a
halo
of
sunlit
glory
i
could
compare
its
wondrous
lustre
to
no
color
save
that
of
molten
gold
deeply
alloyed
with
copper
but
that
comparison
tells
you
nothing
i
can
find
no
simile
with
which
to
describe
the
beauties
of
its
shades
and
tints
it
was
red
but
it
also
was
golden
as
if
the
enamoured
sun
had
gilded
every
hair
with
its
radiance
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
this
tall
girl
hair
still
it
was
the
vernon
red
my
cousin
sir
george
and
many
vernons
had
hair
of
the
same
color
yet
the
girl
hair
differed
from
all
other
i
had
ever
seen
it
had
a
light
and
a
lustre
of
its
own
which
was
as
distinct
from
the
ordinary
vernon
red
although
that
is
very
good
and
we
are
proud
of
it
as
the
sheen
of
gold
is
from
the
glitter
of
brass
i
knew
by
the
girl
hair
that
she
was
my
cousin
dorothy
vernon
whom
i
reluctantly
had
come
to
wed
i
asked
myself
can
this
be
the
plain
freckled
girl
i
knew
seven
years
ago
compared
with
her
beauty
even
mary
stuart
was
pale
as
the
vapid
moon
at
dawn
the
girl
seemed
to
be
the
incarnated
spirit
of
universal
life
and
light
and
i
had
condescendingly
come
to
marry
this
goddess
i
felt
a
dash
of
contemptuous
pity
for
my
complacent
self
in
my
cogitations
concerning
marriage
with
dorothy
vernon
i
had
not
at
all
taken
into
consideration
her
personal
inclination
a
girl
after
all
is
but
the
chattel
of
her
father
and
must
perforce
if
needs
be
marry
the
man
who
is
chosen
for
her
but
leaving
parental
authority
out
of
the
question
a
girl
with
hair
and
a
multitude
of
freckles
need
not
be
considered
when
an
agreeable
handsome
man
offers
himself
as
a
husband
she
usually
is
willing
to
the
point
of
eagerness
that
is
the
manner
in
which
i
had
thought
about
dorothy
vernon
if
i
considered
her
at
all
but
when
a
man
is
about
to
offer
himself
to
a
goddess
he
is
apt
to
pause
in
such
a
case
there
are
always
two
sides
to
the
question
and
nine
chances
to
one
the
goddess
will
coolly
take
possession
of
both
when
i
saw
dorothy
in
the
courtyard
of
the
peacock
i
instantly
knew
that
she
was
a
girl
to
be
taken
into
account
in
all
matters
wherein
she
was
personally
concerned
her
every
feature
every
poise
and
gesture
unconsciously
bore
the
stamp
of
i
will
or
i
will
not
walking
by
dorothy
side
holding
her
hand
was
a
fair
young
woman
whose
hair
was
black
and
whose
skin
was
of
the
white
clear
complexion
such
as
we
see
in
the
faces
of
nuns
she
walked
with
a
hesitating
cautious
step
and
clung
to
dorothy
who
was
gentle
and
attentive
to
her
but
of
this
fair
pale
girl
i
have
so
much
to
say
in
the
pages
to
come
that
i
shall
not
further
describe
her
here
when
the
ladies
had
entered
the
inn
my
companion
and
i
dismounted
and
manners
exclaimed
did
you
see
the
glorious
girl
who
but
now
entered
the
inn
door
gods
i
never
before
saw
such
beauty
yes
i
replied
i
know
her
how
fortunate
i
am
said
sir
john
perhaps
i
may
induce
you
to
present
me
to
her
at
least
you
will
tell
me
her
name
that
i
may
seek
her
acquaintance
by
the
usual
means
i
am
not
susceptible
but
by
my
faith
i
i
she
looked
at
me
from
the
and
when
i
caught
her
eyes
it
seemed
that
is
i
saw
or
i
felt
a
stream
of
burning
life
enter
my
soul
and
but
you
will
think
i
am
a
fool
i
know
i
am
a
fool
but
i
feel
as
if
i
were
as
if
i
had
been
bewitched
in
one
little
second
of
time
and
by
a
single
glance
from
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
you
certainly
will
think
i
am
a
fool
but
you
can
not
understand
why
ca
i
understand
i
asked
indignantly
the
thing
you
have
seen
and
felt
has
been
in
this
world
long
enough
for
every
man
to
understand
eve
used
it
upon
adam
i
ca
understand
damme
sir
do
you
think
i
am
a
clod
i
have
felt
it
fifty
times
not
began
sir
john
hesitatingly
nonsense
i
replied
you
too
will
have
the
same
experience
fifty
times
again
before
you
are
my
age
but
the
lady
said
sir
john
tell
me
of
her
will
you
can
you
present
me
to
her
if
not
will
you
tell
me
who
she
is
i
remained
for
a
moment
in
thought
wondering
if
it
were
right
for
me
to
tell
him
that
the
girl
whom
he
so
much
admired
was
the
daughter
of
his
father
enemy
i
could
see
no
way
of
keeping
dorothy
name
from
him
so
i
determined
to
tell
him
she
is
my
cousin
mistress
dorothy
vernon
i
said
the
eldest
is
lady
dorothy
crawford
the
beautiful
pale
girl
i
do
not
know
i
am
sorry
returned
sir
john
she
is
the
lady
whom
you
have
come
to
marry
is
she
not
said
i
hesitatingly
you
certainly
are
to
be
congratulated
returned
manners
i
doubt
if
i
shall
marry
her
i
replied
why
asked
manners
for
many
reasons
chief
among
which
is
her
beauty
that
is
an
unusual
reason
for
declining
a
woman
responded
sir
john
with
a
low
laugh
i
think
it
is
quite
usual
i
replied
having
in
mind
the
difficulty
with
which
great
beauties
are
won
but
i
continued
a
woman
of
moderate
beauty
makes
a
safer
wife
and
in
the
long
run
is
more
comforting
than
one
who
is
too
attractive
you
are
a
philosopher
sir
malcolm
said
manners
laughingly
and
a
liar
i
muttered
to
myself
i
felt
sure
however
that
i
should
never
marry
dorothy
vernon
and
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
even
at
this
early
stage
in
my
history
that
i
was
right
in
my
premonition
i
did
not
marry
her
i
suppose
i
shall
now
be
compelled
to
give
you
up
to
your
relatives
said
manners
yes
i
returned
we
must
say
for
the
present
but
if
we
do
not
meet
again
it
shall
not
be
for
the
lack
of
my
wishing
your
father
and
sir
george
would
feel
deeply
injured
should
they
learn
of
our
friendship
therefore
you
are
quite
right
he
interrupted
it
is
better
that
no
one
should
know
of
it
nevertheless
between
you
and
me
let
there
be
no
feud
the
secrecy
of
our
friendship
will
give
it
zest
said
i
that
is
true
but
wine
needs
no
bush
you
will
not
mention
my
name
to
the
ladies
no
if
you
wish
that
i
shall
not
i
do
so
wish
when
the
stable
boys
had
taken
our
horses
i
gave
my
hand
to
sir
john
after
which
we
entered
the
inn
and
treated
each
other
as
strangers
soon
after
i
had
washed
the
stains
of
travel
from
my
hands
and
face
i
sent
the
maid
to
my
cousins
asking
that
i
might
be
permitted
to
pay
my
devotions
and
dorothy
came
to
the
in
response
to
my
message
when
she
entered
she
ran
to
me
with
outstretched
hands
and
a
gleam
of
welcome
in
her
eyes
we
had
been
rare
friends
when
she
was
a
child
ah
cousin
malcolm
what
a
fine
surprise
you
have
given
us
she
exclaimed
clasping
both
my
hands
and
offering
me
her
cheek
to
kiss
father
delight
will
be
beyond
measure
when
he
sees
you
as
mine
now
is
i
responded
gazing
at
her
from
head
to
foot
and
drinking
in
her
beauty
with
my
eyes
doll
doll
what
a
splendid
girl
you
have
become
who
would
have
thought
that
that
i
hesitated
realizing
that
i
was
rapidly
getting
myself
into
trouble
say
it
say
it
cousin
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
rusty
red
hair
angular
shoulders
sharp
elbows
freckles
thickly
set
as
stars
upon
a
clear
night
and
so
large
and
brown
that
they
fairly
twinkled
great
staring
green
eyes
awkward
and
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
mimic
horror
at
the
remembrance
no
one
could
have
supposed
that
such
a
girl
would
have
become
that
is
you
know
she
continued
confusedly
could
have
changed
i
have
a
freckle
now
and
she
lifted
her
face
that
i
might
prove
the
truth
of
her
words
by
examination
and
perhaps
that
i
might
also
observe
her
beauty
neither
did
i
waste
the
opportunity
i
dwelt
longingly
upon
the
wondrous
red
golden
hair
which
fringed
her
low
broad
forehead
and
upon
the
heavy
black
eyebrows
the
pencilled
points
of
whose
curves
almost
touched
across
the
nose
i
saw
the
ivory
of
her
skin
and
the
long
jet
lashes
curving
in
a
great
sweep
from
her
full
white
lids
and
i
thought
full
sure
that
venus
herself
was
before
me
my
gaze
halted
for
a
moment
at
the
long
eyes
which
changed
with
the
shifting
light
and
varied
with
her
moods
from
deep
fathomless
green
to
violet
and
from
violet
to
soft
voluptuous
brown
but
in
all
their
tints
beaming
forth
a
lustre
that
would
have
stirred
the
soul
of
an
anchorite
then
i
noted
the
beauty
of
her
saucy
nose
and
the
red
arch
of
her
lips
slightly
parted
for
the
purpose
of
showing
her
teeth
but
i
could
not
stop
long
to
dwell
upon
any
one
especial
feature
for
there
were
still
to
be
seen
her
divine
round
chin
her
large
white
throat
and
the
infinite
grace
in
poise
and
curve
of
her
strong
young
form
i
dared
not
pause
nor
waste
my
time
if
i
were
to
see
it
all
for
such
a
girl
as
dorothy
waits
no
leisure
that
is
unless
she
wishes
to
wait
in
such
case
there
is
no
moving
her
and
patience
becomes
to
her
a
delightful
virtue
after
my
prolonged
scrutiny
dorothy
lowered
her
face
and
said
laughingly
now
come
cousin
tell
me
the
truth
who
would
have
thought
it
possible
not
i
doll
not
i
if
you
will
pardon
me
the
frankness
oh
that
is
easily
done
then
with
a
merry
ripple
of
laughter
it
is
much
easier
i
fancy
for
a
woman
to
speak
of
the
time
when
she
was
plain
than
to
refer
to
the
time
when
when
she
was
beautiful
what
an
absurd
speech
that
is
for
me
to
make
she
said
confusedly
i
certainly
did
not
expect
to
find
so
great
a
change
said
i
why
doll
you
are
wondrous
glorious
beautiful
i
ca
find
words
then
do
try
cousin
malcolm
she
said
with
a
smile
that
fringed
her
mouth
in
dimples
do
try
you
will
make
me
vain
you
are
that
already
doll
i
answered
to
tease
her
i
fear
i
am
cousin
vain
as
a
man
but
do
call
me
doll
i
am
tall
enough
to
be
called
dorothy
she
straightened
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
stepping
close
to
my
side
said
i
am
as
tall
as
you
i
will
now
try
to
make
you
vain
you
look
just
as
young
and
as
handsome
as
when
i
last
saw
you
and
so
ardently
admired
your
waving
black
mustachio
and
your
curling
chin
beard
did
you
admire
them
doll
dorothy
i
asked
hoping
though
with
little
faith
that
the
admiration
might
still
continue
oh
prodigiously
she
answered
with
unassuring
candor
prodigiously
now
who
is
vain
cousin
malcolm
françois
de
lorraine
vernon
i
i
responded
shrugging
my
shoulders
and
confessing
by
compulsion
but
you
must
remember
she
continued
provokingly
that
a
girl
of
twelve
is
very
immature
in
her
judgment
and
will
fall
in
love
with
any
man
who
allows
her
to
look
upon
him
twice
then
i
am
to
believe
that
the
fire
begins
very
early
to
burn
in
the
feminine
heart
i
responded
with
birth
my
cousin
with
birth
she
replied
but
in
my
heart
it
burned
itself
out
upon
your
curling
beard
at
the
mature
age
of
twelve
and
you
have
never
been
in
love
since
that
time
doll
dorothy
i
asked
with
more
earnestness
in
my
heart
than
in
my
voice
no
no
by
the
virgin
no
not
even
in
the
shadow
of
a
thought
and
by
the
help
of
the
virgin
i
hope
i
never
shall
be
for
when
it
comes
to
me
mark
my
word
cousin
there
will
be
trouble
in
derbyshire
by
my
soul
i
believe
you
speak
the
truth
i
answered
little
dreaming
how
quickly
our
joint
prophecy
would
come
true
i
then
asked
dorothy
to
tell
me
about
her
father
father
is
well
in
health
she
said
in
mind
he
has
been
much
troubled
and
disturbed
last
month
he
lost
the
lawsuit
against
detestable
old
lord
rutland
he
was
much
angered
by
the
loss
and
has
been
moody
and
morose
in
brooding
over
it
ever
since
he
tries
poor
father
to
find
relief
from
his
troubles
and
and
i
fear
takes
too
much
liquor
rutland
and
his
friends
swore
to
one
lie
upon
another
and
father
believes
that
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
was
bribed
father
intends
to
appeal
to
parliament
but
even
in
parliament
he
fears
he
can
not
obtain
justice
lord
son
a
disreputable
fellow
who
for
many
years
has
lived
at
court
is
a
favorite
with
the
queen
and
his
acquaintance
with
her
majesty
and
with
the
lords
will
be
to
father
prejudice
i
have
always
believed
that
your
father
stood
in
the
queen
good
graces
i
said
interrogatively
so
he
does
but
i
have
been
told
that
this
son
of
lord
rutland
whom
i
have
never
seen
has
the
beauty
of
of
the
devil
and
exercises
a
great
influence
over
her
majesty
and
her
friends
the
young
man
is
not
known
in
this
neighborhood
for
he
has
never
deigned
to
leave
the
court
but
lady
cavendish
tells
me
he
has
all
the
fascinations
of
satan
i
would
that
satan
had
him
the
feud
still
lives
between
vernon
and
rutland
i
asked
yes
and
it
will
continue
to
live
so
long
as
an
ounce
of
blood
can
hold
a
pound
of
hatred
said
the
girl
with
flashing
eyes
and
hard
lips
i
love
to
hate
the
accursed
race
they
have
wronged
our
house
for
three
generations
and
my
father
has
suffered
greater
injury
at
their
hands
than
any
of
our
name
let
us
not
talk
of
the
hateful
subject
we
changed
the
topic
i
had
expected
dorothy
to
invite
me
to
go
with
her
to
meet
lady
crawford
but
the
girl
seemed
disinclined
to
leave
the
the
peacock
was
her
father
property
and
the
host
and
hostess
were
her
friends
after
the
manner
of
persons
in
their
degree
therefore
dorothy
felt
at
liberty
to
visit
the
quite
as
freely
as
if
it
had
been
the
kitchen
of
haddon
hall
during
our
conversation
i
had
frequently
noticed
dorothy
glancing
slyly
in
the
direction
of
the
fireplace
but
my
back
was
turned
that
way
and
i
did
not
know
nor
did
it
at
first
occur
to
me
to
wonder
what
attracted
her
attention
soon
she
began
to
lose
the
thread
of
our
conversation
and
made
inappropriate
tardy
replies
to
my
remarks
the
glances
toward
the
fireplace
increased
in
number
and
duration
and
her
efforts
to
pay
attention
to
what
i
was
saying
became
painful
failures
after
a
little
time
she
said
is
it
not
cool
here
let
us
go
over
to
the
fireplace
where
it
is
warmer
i
turned
to
go
with
her
and
at
once
saw
that
it
was
not
the
fire
in
the
fireplace
which
had
attracted
dorothy
but
quite
a
different
sort
of
flame
in
short
much
to
my
consternation
i
discovered
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
my
handsome
friend
sir
john
manners
toward
whom
dorothy
had
been
glancing
we
walked
over
to
the
fireplace
and
one
of
the
fires
sir
john
moved
away
but
the
girl
turned
her
face
that
she
might
see
him
in
his
new
position
the
movement
i
confess
looked
bold
to
the
point
of
brazenness
but
if
the
movement
was
bold
what
shall
i
say
of
her
glances
and
the
expression
of
her
face
she
seemed
unable
to
take
her
eager
eyes
from
the
stranger
or
to
think
of
anything
but
him
and
after
a
few
moments
she
did
not
try
soon
she
stopped
talking
entirely
and
did
not
even
hear
what
i
was
saying
i
too
became
silent
and
after
a
long
pause
the
girl
asked
cousin
who
is
the
gentleman
with
whom
you
were
travelling
i
was
piqued
by
dorothy
conduct
and
answered
rather
curtly
he
is
a
stranger
i
picked
him
up
at
derby
and
we
rode
here
together
a
pause
followed
awkward
in
its
duration
did
you
not
learn
his
name
asked
dorothy
hesitatingly
yes
i
replied
then
came
another
pause
broken
by
the
girl
who
spoke
in
a
quick
imperious
tone
touched
with
irritation
well
what
is
it
it
is
better
that
i
do
not
tell
you
i
answered
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
we
met
neither
of
us
knew
the
other
please
do
not
ask
me
to
tell
you
his
name
oh
but
you
make
me
all
the
more
eager
to
learn
mystery
you
know
is
intolerable
to
a
woman
except
in
the
unravelling
come
tell
me
tell
me
not
of
course
that
i
really
care
a
farthing
to
know
but
the
mystery
a
mystery
drives
me
wild
tell
me
please
do
cousin
malcolm
she
certainly
was
posing
for
the
stranger
benefit
and
was
doing
all
in
her
power
while
coaxing
me
to
display
her
charms
graces
and
pretty
little
ways
her
attitude
and
conduct
spoke
as
plainly
as
the
spring
bird
song
speaks
to
its
mate
yet
dorothy
manner
did
not
seem
bold
even
to
me
it
appeared
modest
beautiful
and
necessary
she
seemed
to
act
under
compulsion
she
would
laugh
for
the
purpose
no
doubt
of
showing
her
dimples
and
her
teeth
and
would
lean
her
head
to
one
side
to
display
her
eyes
to
the
best
advantage
and
then
would
she
shyly
glance
toward
sir
john
to
see
if
he
was
watching
her
it
was
shameless
but
it
could
not
be
helped
by
dorothy
nor
any
one
else
after
a
few
moments
of
mute
pleading
by
the
girl
broken
now
and
then
by
please
please
i
said
if
you
give
to
me
your
promise
that
you
will
never
speak
of
this
matter
to
any
person
i
will
tell
you
the
gentleman
name
i
would
not
for
a
great
deal
have
your
father
know
that
i
have
held
conversation
with
him
even
for
a
moment
though
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
who
he
was
oh
this
is
delightful
he
must
be
some
famous
dashing
highwayman
i
promise
of
course
i
promise
faithfully
she
was
glancing
constantly
toward
manners
and
her
face
was
bright
with
smiles
and
eager
with
anticipation
he
is
worse
than
a
highwayman
i
regret
to
say
the
gentleman
toward
whom
you
are
so
ardently
glancing
is
sir
john
manners
a
shock
of
pain
passed
over
dorothy
face
followed
by
a
hard
repellent
expression
that
was
almost
ugly
let
us
go
to
aunt
dorothy
she
said
as
she
turned
and
walked
across
the
room
toward
the
door
when
we
had
closed
the
door
of
the
behind
us
dorothy
said
angrily
tell
me
cousin
how
you
a
vernon
came
to
be
in
his
company
i
told
you
that
i
met
him
quite
by
accident
at
the
royal
arms
in
we
became
friends
before
either
knew
the
other
name
after
chance
had
disclosed
our
identities
he
asked
for
a
truce
to
our
feud
until
the
morrow
and
he
was
so
gentle
and
open
in
his
conduct
that
i
could
not
and
would
not
refuse
his
proffered
olive
branch
in
truth
whatever
faults
may
be
attributable
to
lord
rutland
and
i
am
sure
he
deserves
all
the
evil
you
have
spoken
of
him
his
son
sir
john
is
a
noble
gentleman
else
i
have
been
reading
the
book
of
human
nature
all
my
life
in
vain
perhaps
he
is
in
no
way
to
blame
for
his
father
conduct
he
may
have
had
no
part
in
it
perhaps
he
has
not
said
dorothy
musingly
it
was
not
a
pleasant
task
for
me
to
praise
sir
john
but
my
sense
of
justice
impelled
me
to
do
so
i
tried
to
make
myself
feel
injured
and
chagrined
because
of
dorothy
manner
toward
him
for
you
must
remember
i
had
arranged
with
myself
to
marry
this
girl
but
i
could
not
work
my
feelings
into
a
state
of
indignation
against
the
heir
to
rutland
the
truth
is
my
hope
of
winning
dorothy
had
evaporated
upon
the
first
sight
of
her
like
the
volatile
essence
it
really
was
i
can
not
tell
you
why
but
i
at
once
seemed
to
realize
that
all
the
thought
and
labor
which
i
had
devoted
to
the
arduous
task
of
arranging
with
myself
this
marriage
was
labor
lost
so
i
frankly
told
her
my
kindly
feelings
for
sir
john
and
gave
her
my
high
estimate
of
his
character
i
continued
you
see
dorothy
i
could
not
so
easily
explain
to
your
father
my
association
with
sir
john
and
i
hope
you
will
not
speak
of
it
to
any
one
lest
the
news
should
reach
sir
george
ears
i
will
not
speak
of
it
she
returned
sighing
faintly
after
all
it
is
not
his
fault
that
his
father
is
such
a
villain
he
does
look
like
his
father
does
he
i
can
not
say
i
never
saw
lord
rutland
i
replied
he
is
the
most
but
she
broke
off
the
sentence
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
revery
we
were
in
the
darkened
passage
and
dorothy
had
taken
my
hand
that
little
act
in
another
woman
of
course
would
have
led
to
a
demonstration
on
my
part
but
in
this
girl
it
seemed
so
entirely
natural
and
candid
that
it
was
a
complete
bar
to
undue
familiarity
in
truth
i
had
no
such
tendency
for
the
childish
act
spoke
of
an
innocence
and
faith
that
were
very
sweet
to
me
who
all
my
life
had
lived
among
men
and
women
who
laughed
at
those
simple
virtues
the
simple
conditions
of
life
are
all
that
are
worth
striving
for
they
come
to
us
fresh
from
nature
and
from
nature
god
the
complex
are
but
concoctions
of
man
after
recipes
in
the
devil
alchemy
so
much
gold
so
much
ambition
so
much
lust
mix
well
product
so
much
vexation
he
must
resemble
his
mother
said
dorothy
after
a
long
pause
poor
fellow
his
mother
is
dead
he
is
like
me
in
that
respect
i
wonder
if
his
father
villanies
trouble
him
i
think
they
must
trouble
him
he
seems
to
be
sad
said
i
intending
to
be
ironical
my
reply
was
taken
seriously
i
am
sorry
for
him
she
said
it
is
not
right
to
hate
even
our
enemies
the
book
tells
us
that
yet
you
hate
lord
rutland
said
i
amused
and
provoked
unexpected
and
dangerous
symptoms
were
rapidly
developing
in
the
perverse
girl
and
trouble
was
brewing
in
derbyshire
the
adjective
perverse
by
the
way
usually
is
superfluous
when
used
to
modify
the
noun
girl
yet
you
hate
lord
rutland
i
repeated
why
she
responded
i
can
not
help
that
but
you
know
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
to
hate
all
his
family
to
hate
him
is
bad
enough
i
soon
began
to
fear
that
i
had
praised
sir
john
overmuch
i
think
sir
john
is
all
there
is
of
lord
rutland
family
i
said
alarmed
yet
amused
at
dorothy
search
for
an
excuse
not
to
hate
my
friend
well
she
continued
after
a
pause
throwing
her
head
to
one
side
i
am
sorry
there
are
no
more
of
that
family
not
to
hate
dorothy
dorothy
i
exclaimed
what
has
come
over
you
you
surprise
me
yes
she
answered
with
a
little
sigh
i
certainly
have
surprised
myself
by
by
my
willingness
to
forgive
those
who
have
injured
my
house
i
did
not
know
there
was
so
much
so
much
good
in
me
mistress
pharisee
thought
i
you
are
a
hypocrite
again
intending
to
be
ironical
i
said
shall
i
fetch
him
from
the
and
present
him
to
you
once
more
my
irony
was
lost
upon
the
girl
evidently
that
sort
of
humor
was
not
my
strong
point
no
no
she
responded
indignantly
i
would
not
speak
to
him
for
again
she
broke
her
sentence
abruptly
and
after
a
little
pause
short
in
itself
but
amply
long
for
a
girl
like
dorothy
to
change
her
mind
two
score
times
she
continued
it
would
not
be
for
the
best
what
think
you
cousin
malcolm
surely
the
girl
has
gone
mad
thought
i
her
voice
was
soft
and
conciliating
as
if
to
say
i
trust
entirely
to
your
mature
superior
judgment
my
judgment
coincided
emphatically
with
her
words
and
i
said
i
spoke
only
in
jest
it
certainly
would
not
be
right
it
would
be
all
wrong
if
you
were
to
meet
him
that
is
true
the
girl
responded
with
firmness
but
but
no
real
harm
could
come
of
it
she
continued
laughing
nervously
he
could
not
strike
me
nor
bite
me
of
course
it
would
be
unpleasant
for
me
to
meet
him
and
as
there
is
no
need
i
am
curious
to
know
what
one
of
his
race
is
like
it
the
only
reason
that
would
induce
me
to
consent
of
course
you
know
there
could
be
no
other
reason
for
me
to
wish
that
is
you
know
to
be
willing
to
meet
him
of
course
you
know
certainly
i
replied
still
clinging
to
my
unsuccessful
irony
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
about
him
so
that
you
may
understand
what
he
is
like
as
for
his
personal
appearance
you
saw
him
did
you
not
i
thought
surely
that
piece
of
irony
would
not
fail
but
it
did
and
i
have
seldom
since
attempted
to
use
that
form
of
humor
yes
oh
yes
i
saw
him
for
a
moment
but
i
will
not
present
him
to
you
dorothy
however
much
you
may
wish
to
meet
him
i
said
positively
it
is
almost
an
insult
cousin
malcolm
for
you
to
say
that
i
wish
to
meet
him
she
answered
in
indignation
the
french
blood
in
my
veins
moved
me
to
shrug
my
shoulders
i
could
do
nothing
else
with
all
my
knowledge
of
womankind
this
girl
had
sent
me
to
sea
but
what
shall
we
say
of
dorothy
conduct
i
fancy
i
can
hear
you
mutter
this
dorothy
vernon
must
have
been
a
bold
immodest
brazen
girl
nothing
of
the
sort
dare
you
of
the
cold
blood
if
perchance
there
be
any
with
that
curse
in
their
veins
who
read
these
lines
dare
you
i
say
lift
your
voice
against
the
blessed
heat
in
others
which
is
but
a
greater
stronger
warmer
spark
of
god
own
soul
than
you
possess
or
than
you
can
comprehend
evil
often
comes
of
it
i
hear
you
say
that
i
freely
admit
and
evil
comes
from
eating
too
much
bread
and
from
hearing
too
much
preaching
but
the
universe
from
the
humblest
blade
of
grass
to
the
infinite
essence
of
god
exists
because
of
that
warmth
which
the
mawkish
world
contemns
is
the
iron
immodest
when
it
creeps
to
the
lodestone
and
clings
to
its
side
is
the
hen
bird
brazen
when
she
flutters
to
her
mate
responsive
to
his
compelling
is
the
seed
immodest
when
it
sinks
into
the
ground
and
swells
with
budding
life
is
the
cloud
bold
when
it
softens
into
rain
and
falls
to
earth
because
it
has
no
other
choice
or
is
it
brazen
when
it
nestles
for
a
time
on
the
bosom
of
heaven
arched
dome
and
sinking
into
the
fathomless
depths
of
a
blue
black
infinity
ceases
to
be
itself
is
the
human
soul
immodest
when
drawn
by
a
force
it
can
not
resist
it
seeks
a
stronger
soul
which
absorbs
its
ego
as
the
blue
sky
absorbs
the
floating
cloud
as
the
warm
earth
swells
the
seed
as
the
magnet
draws
the
iron
all
these
are
of
one
quality
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
soul
of
man
are
they
are
do
they
do
love
as
they
love
live
as
they
live
and
die
as
they
die
because
they
must
because
they
have
no
other
choice
we
think
we
are
free
because
at
times
we
act
as
we
please
forgetting
that
god
gives
us
the
please
and
that
every
act
of
our
being
is
but
the
result
of
a
dictated
motive
dorothy
was
not
immodest
this
was
her
case
she
was
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
you
too
are
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
it
is
only
human
vanity
which
prompts
you
to
believe
that
you
are
yourself
and
that
you
are
free
do
you
find
any
freedom
in
this
world
save
that
which
you
fondly
believe
to
exist
within
yourself
self
there
is
but
one
self
god
i
have
been
told
that
the
people
of
the
east
call
him

the
word
it

all
i
have
felt
that
the
beautiful
pagan
thought
has
truth
in
it
but
my
conscience
and
my

tell
me
rather
to
cling
to
truths

have
than
to
fly
to
others

i
know
not
of

chapter
iii
the
pitcher
goes
to
the
well
dorothy
and
i
went
to
the
inn
parlors
where
i
received
a
cordial
welcome
from
my
cousin
lady
crawford
after
our
greeting
dorothy
came
toward
me
leading
the
fair
pale
girl
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
courtyard
madge
this
is
my
cousin
malcolm
vernon
said
dorothy
he
was
a
dear
friend
of
my
childhood
and
is
much
beloved
by
my
father
lady
magdalene
stanley
cousin
and
she
placed
the
girl
soft
white
hand
in
mine
there
was
a
peculiar
hesitancy
in
the
girl
manner
which
puzzled
me
she
did
not
look
at
me
when
dorothy
placed
her
hand
in
mine
but
kept
her
eyes
cast
down
the
long
black
lashes
resting
upon
the
fair
curves
of
her
cheek
like
a
shadow
on
the
snow
she
murmured
a
salutation
and
when
i
made
a
remark
that
called
for
a
response
she
lifted
her
eyes
but
seemed
not
to
look
at
me
unconsciously
i
turned
my
face
toward
dorothy
who
closed
her
eyes
and
formed
with
her
lips
the
word
blind
i
retained
the
girl
hand
and
she
did
not
withdraw
it
when
i
caught
dorothy
unspoken
word
i
led
lady
madge
to
a
chair
and
asked
if
i
might
sit
beside
her
certainly
she
answered
smilingly
you
know
i
am
blind
but
i
can
hear
and
speak
and
i
enjoy
having
persons
i
like
sit
near
me
that
i
may
touch
them
now
and
then
while
we
talk
if
i
could
only
see
she
exclaimed
still
there
was
no
tone
of
complaint
in
her
voice
and
very
little
even
of
regret
the
girl
eyes
were
of
a
deep
blue
and
were
entirely
without
scar
or
other
evidence
of
blindness
except
that
they
did
not
seem
to
see
i
afterward
learned
that
her
affliction
had
come
upon
her
as
the
result
of
illness
when
she
was
a
child
she
was
niece
to
the
earl
of
derby
and
dorothy
mother
had
been
her
aunt
she
owned
a
small
estate
and
had
lived
at
haddon
hall
five
or
six
years
because
of
the
love
that
existed
between
her
and
dorothy
a
strong
man
instinctively
longs
to
cherish
that
which
needs
his
strength
and
perhaps
it
was
the
girl
helplessness
that
first
appealed
to
me
perhaps
it
was
her
rare
peculiar
beauty
speaking
eloquently
of
virtue
such
as
i
had
never
known
that
touched
me
i
can
not
say
what
the
impelling
cause
was
but
this
i
know
my
heart
went
out
in
pity
to
her
and
all
that
was
good
within
me
good
which
i
had
never
before
suspected
stirred
in
my
soul
and
my
past
life
seemed
black
and
barren
beyond
endurance
even
dorothy
marvellous
beauty
lacked
the
subtle
quality
which
this
simple
blind
girl
possessed
the
first
step
in
regeneration
is
to
see
one
faults
the
second
is
to
regret
them
the
third
is
to
quit
them
the
first
and
second
steps
constitute
repentance
the
second
and
third
regeneration
one
hour
within
the
radius
of
madge
stanley
influence
brought
me
to
repentance
but
repentance
is
an
everyday
virtue
should
i
ever
achieve
regeneration
that
is
one
of
the
questions
this
history
will
answer
to
me
madge
stanley
passive
force
was
the
strongest
influence
for
good
that
had
ever
impinged
on
my
life
with
respect
to
her
morally
i
was
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
for
she
acting
unconsciously
moved
me
with
neither
knowledge
nor
volition
on
my
part
soon
after
my
arrival
at
the
ladies
parlor
dinner
was
served
and
after
dinner
a
persian
merchant
was
ushered
in
closely
followed
by
his
servants
bearing
bales
of
rare
eastern
fabrics
a
visit
and
a
dinner
at
the
inn
were
little
events
that
made
a
break
in
the
monotony
of
life
at
the
hall
and
the
ladies
preferred
to
visit
the
merchant
who
was
stopping
at
the
peacock
for
a
time
rather
than
to
have
him
take
his
wares
to
haddon
while
lady
crawford
and
dorothy
were
revelling
in
persian
silks
satins
and
gold
cloths
i
sat
by
lady
madge
and
was
more
than
content
that
we
were
left
to
ourselves
my
mind
however
was
as
far
from
thoughts
of
gallantry
as
if
she
had
been
a
nun
i
believe
i
have
not
told
you
that
i
was
of
the
holy
catholic
faith
my
religion
i
may
say
has
always
been
more
nominal
and
political
than
spiritual
although
there
ran
through
it
a
strong
vein
of
inherited
tendencies
and
superstitions
which
were
highly
colored
by
contempt
for
heresy
and
heretics
i
was
catholic
by
habit
but
if
i
analyzed
my
supposed
religious
belief
i
found
that
i
had
none
save
a
hatred
for
heresy
heretics
as
a
rule
were
persons
vulgarly
moral
and
as
i
had
always
thought
despisedly
hypocritical
madge
stanley
however
was
a
protestant
and
that
fact
shook
the
structure
of
my
old
mistakes
to
its
foundation
and
left
me
religionless
after
the
persian
merchant
had
packed
his
bales
and
departed
dorothy
and
lady
crawford
joined
madge
and
me
near
the
fireplace
soon
dorothy
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
gazing
into
the
courtyard
after
a
few
minutes
lady
crawford
said
dorothy
had
we
not
better
order
dawson
to
bring
out
the
horses
and
coach
will
dawson
was
sir
george
forester
lady
crawford
repeated
her
question
but
dorothy
was
too
intently
watching
the
scene
in
the
courtyard
to
hear
i
went
over
to
her
and
looking
out
at
the
window
discovered
the
object
of
dorothy
rapt
attention
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
who
it
was
irony
as
you
know
and
as
i
had
learned
was
harmless
against
this
nymph
of
course
i
had
no
authority
to
scold
her
so
i
laughed
the
object
of
dorothy
attention
was
about
to
mount
his
horse
he
was
drawing
on
his
gauntleted
gloves
and
held
between
his
teeth
a
cigarro
he
certainly
presented
a
handsome
figure
for
the
eyes
of
an
ardent
girl
to
rest
upon
while
he
stood
beneath
the
window
clothed
in
a
fashionable
suit
of
brown
doublet
trunks
and
hose
his
boots
were
polished
till
they
shone
and
his
hat
of
soft
beaver
was
surmounted
by
a
flowing
plume
even
i
who
had
no
especial
taste
nor
love
for
masculine
beauty
felt
my
sense
of
the
beautiful
strongly
moved
by
the
attractive
picture
my
friend
presented
his
dress
manner
and
bearing
polished
by
the
friction
of
life
at
a
luxurious
court
must
have
appeared
to
dorothy
she
had
never
travelled
farther
from
home
than
buxton
and
and
had
met
only
the
men
belonging
to
the
surrounding
gentry
and
nobility
of
derbyshire
nottingham
and
stafford
she
had
met
but
few
even
of
them
and
their
lives
had
been
spent
chiefly
in
drinking
hunting
and
gambling
accomplishments
that
do
not
fine
down
the
texture
of
a
man
nature
or
fit
him
for
a
lady
bower
sir
john
manners
was
a
revelation
to
dorothy
and
she
poor
girl
was
bewildered
and
bewitched
by
him
when
john
had
mounted
and
was
moving
away
he
looked
up
to
the
window
where
dorothy
stood
and
a
light
came
to
her
eyes
and
a
smile
to
her
face
which
no
man
who
knows
the
sum
of
two
and
two
can
ever
mistake
if
he
but
once
sees
it
when
i
saw
the
light
in
dorothy
eyes
i
knew
that
all
the
hatred
that
was
ever
born
from
all
the
feuds
that
had
ever
lived
since
the
quarrelling
race
of
man
began
its
feuds
in
eden
could
not
make
dorothy
vernon
hate
the
son
of
her
father
enemy
i
was
was
watching
him
draw
smoke
through
the
the
little
stick
which
he
holds
in
his
mouth
and
and
blow
it
out
again
said
dorothy
in
explanation
of
her
attitude
she
blushed
painfully
and
continued
i
hope
you
do
not
think
i
do
not
think
i
answered
i
would
not
think
of
thinking
of
course
not
she
responded
with
a
forced
smile
as
she
watched
sir
john
pass
out
of
sight
under
the
arch
of
the
innyard
gate
i
did
not
think
i
knew
and
the
sequel
so
full
of
trouble
soon
proved
that
i
was
right
after
john
had
passed
through
the
gate
dorothy
was
willing
to
go
home
and
when
will
dawson
brought
the
great
coach
to
the
inn
door
i
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
beside
the
ladies
to
haddon
hall
two
miles
north
from
rowsley
i
shall
not
stop
to
tell
you
of
the
warm
welcome
given
me
by
sir
george
vernon
nor
of
his
delight
when
i
briefly
told
him
my
misfortunes
in
scotland
misfortunes
that
had
brought
me
to
haddon
hall
nor
shall
i
describe
the
great
boar
head
supper
given
in
my
honor
at
which
there
were
twenty
men
who
could
have
put
me
under
the
table
i
thought
i
knew
something
of
the
art
of
drinking
but
at
that
supper
i
soon
found
i
was
a
mere
tippler
compared
with
these
country
guzzlers
at
that
feast
i
learned
also
that
dorothy
when
she
had
hinted
concerning
sir
george
excessive
drinking
had
told
the
truth
he
being
the
host
drank
with
all
his
guests
near
midnight
he
grew
distressingly
drunk
talkative
and
violent
and
when
toward
morning
he
was
carried
from
the
room
by
his
servants
the
company
broke
up
those
who
could
do
so
reeled
home
those
who
could
not
walk
at
all
were
put
to
bed
by
the
retainers
at
haddon
hall
i
had
chosen
my
bedroom
high
up
in
eagle
tower
at
table
i
had
tried
to
remain
sober
that
however
was
an
impossible
task
for
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
there
was
a
placed
in
the
wainscoting
at
a
height
of
ten
or
twelve
inches
above
the
head
of
an
ordinary
man
and
if
he
refused
to
drink
as
much
as
the
other
guests
thought
he
should
his
wrist
was
fastened
above
his
head
in
the
ring
and
the
liquor
which
he
should
have
poured
down
his
throat
was
poured
down
his
sleeve
therefore
to
avoid
this
species
of
rustic
sport
i
drank
much
more
than
was
good
for
me
when
the
feast
closed
i
thought
i
was
sober
enough
to
go
to
my
room
unassisted
so
i
took
a
candle
and
with
a
great
show
of
climbed
the
spiral
stone
stairway
to
the
door
of
my
room
the
threshold
of
my
door
was
two
or
three
feet
above
the
steps
of
the
stairway
and
after
i
had
contemplated
the
distance
for
a
few
minutes
i
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
me
to
attempt
to
climb
into
my
sleeping
apartments
without
help
accordingly
i
sat
down
upon
the
step
on
which
i
had
been
standing
placed
my
candle
beside
me
called
loudly
for
a
servant
received
no
response
and
fell
asleep
only
to
be
awakened
by
one
of
sir
retainers
coming
downstairs
next
morning
after
that
supper
in
rapid
succession
followed
hunting
and
drinking
feasting
and
dancing
in
my
honor
at
the
dances
the
pipers
furnished
the
music
or
i
should
rather
say
the
noise
their
miserable
wailings
reminded
me
of
scotland
after
all
thought
i
is
the
insidious
polished
vice
of
france
worse
than
the
hoggish
uncouth
practices
of
scotland
and
of
english
country
life
i
could
not
endure
the
latter
so
i
asked
sir
george
on
the
pretext
of
ill
health
to
allow
me
to
refuse
invitations
to
other
houses
and
i
insisted
that
he
should
give
no
more
entertainments
at
haddon
hall
on
my
account
sir
george
eagerly
acquiesced
in
all
my
wishes
in
truth
i
was
treated
like
an
honored
guest
and
a
member
of
the
family
and
i
congratulated
myself
that
my
life
had
fallen
in
such
pleasant
lines
dorothy
and
madge
became
my
constant
companions
for
sir
george
time
was
occupied
chiefly
with
his
estates
and
with
his
duties
as
magistrate
a
feeling
of
rest
and
contentment
came
over
me
and
my
past
life
drifted
back
of
me
like
an
ever
receding
cloud
thus
passed
the
months
of
october
and
november
in
the
meantime
events
in
scotland
and
in
england
proved
my
wisdom
in
seeking
a
home
at
haddon
hall
and
showed
me
how
great
was
my
good
fortune
in
finding
it
queen
mary
was
a
prisoner
at
lochleven
castle
and
her
brother
murray
had
beheaded
many
of
her
friends
elizabeth
hating
mary
as
only
a
plain
envious
woman
can
hate
one
who
is
transcendently
beautiful
had
upon
different
pretexts
seized
many
of
mary
friends
who
had
fled
to
england
for
sanctuary
and
some
of
them
had
suffered
imprisonment
or
death
elizabeth
in
many
instances
had
good
cause
for
her
attitude
toward
mary
friends
since
plots
were
hatching
thick
and
fast
to
liberate
mary
from
lochleven
and
many
such
plots
undoubtedly
had
for
their
chief
end
the
deposition
of
elizabeth
and
the
enthronement
of
mary
as
queen
of
england
as
a
strict
matter
of
law
mary
was
rightful
heir
to
the
english
throne
and
elizabeth
was
an
usurper
parliament
at
henry
request
had
declared
that
elizabeth
his
issue
by
anne
boleyn
was
illegitimate
and
that
being
true
mary
was
next
in
line
of
descent
the
catholics
of
england
took
that
stand
and
mary
beauty
and
powers
of
fascination
had
won
for
her
friends
even
in
the
personal
household
of
the
virgin
queen
small
cause
for
wonder
was
it
that
elizabeth
knowing
all
these
facts
looked
with
suspicion
and
fear
upon
mary
refugee
friends
the
english
queen
well
knew
that
sir
george
vernon
was
her
friend
therefore
his
house
and
his
friendship
were
my
sanctuary
without
which
my
days
certainly
would
have
been
numbered
in
the
land
of
elizabeth
and
their
number
would
have
been
small
i
was
dependent
on
sir
george
not
only
for
a
roof
to
shelter
me
but
for
my
very
life
i
speak
of
these
things
that
you
may
know
some
of
the
many
imperative
reasons
why
i
desired
to
please
and
conciliate
my
cousin
in
addition
to
those
reasons
i
soon
grew
to
love
sir
george
not
only
because
of
his
kindness
to
me
but
because
he
was
a
lovable
man
he
was
generous
just
and
frank
and
although
at
times
he
was
violent
almost
to
the
point
of
temporary
madness
his
heart
was
usually
gentle
and
was
as
easily
touched
by
kindness
as
it
was
quickly
moved
to
cruelty
by
injury
fancied
or
actual
i
have
never
known
a
more
cruel
tender
man
than
he
you
will
see
him
in
each
of
his
natures
before
you
have
finished
this
history
but
you
must
judge
him
only
after
you
have
considered
his
times
which
were
forty
years
ago
his
surroundings
and
his
blood
during
those
two
months
remarkable
changes
occurred
within
the
walls
of
haddon
chief
of
which
were
in
myself
and
alas
in
dorothy
my
pilgrimage
to
haddon
as
you
already
know
had
been
made
for
the
purpose
of
marrying
my
fair
cousin
for
i
did
not
at
the
time
i
left
scotland
suppose
i
should
need
sir
george
protection
against
elizabeth
when
i
met
dorothy
at
rowsley
my
desire
to
marry
her
became
personal
in
addition
to
the
mercenary
motives
with
which
i
had
originally
started
but
i
quickly
recognized
the
fact
that
the
girl
was
beyond
my
reach
i
knew
i
could
not
win
her
love
even
though
i
had
a
thousand
years
to
try
for
it
and
i
would
not
accept
her
hand
in
marriage
solely
at
her
command
i
also
soon
learned
that
dorothy
was
the
child
of
her
father
gentle
loving
and
tender
beyond
the
naming
but
also
wilful
violent
and
fierce
to
the
extent
that
no
command
could
influence
her
first
i
shall
speak
of
the
change
within
myself
i
will
soon
be
done
with
so
much
i
and
me
and
you
shall
have
dorothy
to
your
heart
content
or
trouble
i
know
not
which
soon
after
my
arrival
at
haddon
hall
the
sun
ushered
in
one
of
those
wonderful
days
known
only
to
the
english
autumn
when
the
hush
of
drowsiness
just
before
her
long
winter
sleep
imparts
its
soft
restfulness
to
man
as
if
it
were
a
lotus
feast
dorothy
was
ostentatiously
busy
with
her
household
matters
and
was
consulting
with
butler
cook
and
steward
sir
george
had
ridden
out
to
superintend
his
men
at
work
and
i
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
hail
came
upon
madge
stanley
sitting
in
the
chaplain
room
with
folded
hands
lady
madge
will
you
go
with
me
for
a
walk
this
beautiful
morning
i
asked
gladly
would
i
go
sir
malcolm
she
responded
a
smile
brightening
her
face
and
quickly
fading
away
but
i
i
can
not
walk
in
unfamiliar
places
i
should
fail
you
would
have
to
lead
me
by
the
hand
and
that
i
fear
would
mar
the
pleasure
of
your
walk
indeed
it
would
not
lady
madge
i
should
enjoy
my
walk
all
the
more
if
you
really
wish
me
to
go
i
shall
be
delighted
she
responded
as
the
brightness
came
again
to
her
face
i
sometimes
grow
weary
and
i
confess
a
little
sad
sitting
alone
when
dorothy
can
not
be
with
me
aunt
dorothy
now
that
she
has
her
magnifying
glasses
spectacles
i
think
they
are
called
devotes
all
her
time
to
reading
and
dislikes
to
be
interrupted
i
wish
it
very
much
i
said
surprised
by
the
real
eagerness
of
my
desire
and
unconsciously
endeavoring
to
keep
out
of
the
tones
of
my
voice
a
part
of
that
eagerness
i
shall
take
you
at
your
word
she
said
i
will
go
to
my
room
to
get
my
hat
and
cloak
she
rose
and
began
to
grope
her
way
toward
the
door
holding
out
her
white
expressive
hands
in
front
of
her
it
was
pitiful
and
beautiful
to
see
her
and
my
emotions
welled
up
in
my
throat
till
i
could
hardly
speak
permit
me
to
give
you
my
hand
i
said
huskily
how
i
longed
to
carry
her
every
man
with
the
right
sort
of
a
heart
in
his
breast
has
a
touch
of
the
mother
instinct
in
him
but
alas
i
only
a
touch
ah
wondrous
and
glorious
womanhood
if
you
had
naught
but
the
mother
instinct
to
lift
you
above
your
masters
by
the
hand
of
laws
those
masters
were
still
unworthy
to
tie
the
strings
of
your
shoes
thank
you
said
the
girl
as
she
clasped
my
hand
and
moved
with
confidence
by
my
side
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
dreadful
fear
of
falling
even
through
these
rooms
where
i
have
lived
for
many
years
i
feel
safe
only
in
a
few
places
on
the
stairs
and
in
my
rooms
which
are
also
dorothy
when
dorothy
changes
the
position
of
a
piece
of
furniture
in
the
hall
she
leads
me
to
it
several
times
that
i
may
learn
just
where
it
is
a
long
time
ago
she
changed
the
position
of
a
chair
and
did
not
tell
me
i
fell
against
it
and
was
hurt
dorothy
wept
bitterly
over
the
mishap
and
she
has
never
since
failed
to
tell
me
of
such
changes
i
can
not
make
you
know
how
kind
and
tender
dorothy
is
to
me
i
feel
that
i
should
die
without
her
and
i
know
she
would
grieve
terribly
were
we
to
part
i
could
not
answer
what
a
very
woman
you
will
think
i
was
i
who
could
laugh
while
i
ran
my
sword
through
a
man
heart
could
hardly
restrain
my
tears
for
pity
of
this
beautiful
blind
girl
thank
you
that
will
do
she
said
when
we
came
to
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
i
can
now
go
to
my
rooms
alone
when
she
reached
the
top
she
hesitated
and
groped
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
and
called
laughingly
to
me
while
i
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
i
know
the
way
perfectly
well
but
to
go
alone
in
any
place
is
not
like
being
led
there
are
many
ways
in
which
one
may
be
led
lady
madge
i
answered
aloud
then
i
said
to
myself
that
girl
will
lead
you
to
heaven
malcolm
if
you
will
permit
her
to
do
so
but
years
of
evil
life
are
hard
to
neutralize
there
is
but
one
subtle
elixir
that
can
do
it
love
and
i
had
not
thought
of
that
magic
remedy
with
respect
to
madge
i
hurriedly
fetched
my
hat
and
returned
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
within
a
minute
or
two
madge
came
down
stairs
holding
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
with
one
hand
while
she
grasped
the
banister
with
the
other
as
i
watched
her
descending
i
was
enraptured
with
her
beauty
even
the
marvellous
vital
beauty
of
dorothy
could
not
compare
with
this
fair
pale
loveliness
it
seemed
to
be
almost
a
profanation
for
me
to
admire
the
sweet
oval
of
her
face
upon
her
alabaster
skin
the
black
eyebrows
the
long
lashes
the
faint
blue
veins
and
the
curving
red
lips
stood
in
exquisite
relief
while
she
was
descending
the
stairs
i
caught
a
gleam
of
her
round
snowy
forearm
and
wrist
and
when
my
eyes
sought
the
perfect
curves
of
her
form
disclosed
by
the
clinging
silk
gown
she
wore
i
felt
that
i
had
sinned
in
looking
upon
her
and
i
was
almost
glad
she
could
not
see
the
shame
which
was
in
my
face
cousin
malcolm
are
you
waiting
she
asked
from
midway
in
the
staircase
yes
i
am
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
answered
i
called
you
malcolm
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
when
she
came
near
me
pardon
me
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
i
hear
malcolm
so
frequently
from
dorothy
that
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
i
shall
be
proud
if
you
will
call
me
malcolm
always
i
like
the
name
better
than
any
that
you
can
use
if
you
wish
it
she
said
in
sweet
simple
candor
i
will
call
you
malcolm
and
you
may
call
me
madge
or
just
as
you
please
madge
it
shall
be
that
is
a
compact
i
answered
as
i
opened
the
door
and
we
walked
out
into
the
fresh
air
of
the
bright
october
morning
that
will
stand
for
our
first
compact
we
are
progressing
famously
she
said
with
a
low
laugh
of
delight
ah
to
think
that
the
blind
can
laugh
god
is
good
we
walked
out
past
the
stables
and
the
cottage
and
crossed
the
river
on
the
great
stone
bridge
then
we
took
our
way
down
the
babbling
wye
keeping
close
to
its
banks
while
the
dancing
waters
and
even
the
gleaming
pebbles
seemed
to
dimple
and
smile
as
they
softly
sang
their
song
of
welcome
to
the
fair
kindred
spirit
who
had
come
to
visit
them
if
we
wandered
from
the
banks
for
but
a
moment
the
waters
seemed
to
struggle
and
turn
in
their
course
until
they
were
again
by
her
side
and
then
would
they
gently
flow
and
murmur
their
contentment
as
they
travelled
forward
to
the
sea
full
of
the
memory
of
her
sweet
presence
and
during
all
that
time
i
led
her
by
the
hand
i
tell
you
friends
is
sweet
to
write
of
it
when
we
returned
we
crossed
the
wye
by
the
stone
footbridge
and
entered
the
garden
below
the
terrace
at
the
corner
postern
we
remained
for
an
hour
resting
upon
the
terrace
balustrade
and
before
we
went
indoors
madge
again
spoke
of
dorothy
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
have
enjoyed
this
walk
nor
how
thankful
i
am
to
you
for
taking
me
she
said
i
did
not
interrupt
her
by
replying
for
i
loved
to
hear
her
talk
dorothy
sometimes
takes
me
with
her
for
a
short
walk
but
i
seldom
have
that
pleasure
walking
is
too
slow
for
dorothy
she
is
so
strong
and
full
of
life
she
delights
to
ride
her
mare
dolcy
have
you
seen
dolcy
no
i
responded
you
must
see
her
at
once
she
is
the
most
beautiful
animal
in
the
world
though
small
of
limb
she
is
swift
as
the
wind
and
as
easy
as
a
cradle
in
her
gaits
she
is
mettlesome
and
fiery
but
full
of
affection
she
often
kisses
dorothy
mare
and
rider
are
finely
mated
dorothy
is
the
most
perfect
woman
and
dolcy
is
the
most
perfect
mare
two
d
we
call
them
but
dorothy
says
we
must
be
careful
not
to
put
a
a
dash
between
them
she
said
with
a
laugh
and
a
blush
then
i
led
madge
into
the
hall
and
she
was
blithe
and
happy
as
if
the
blessed
light
of
day
were
in
her
eyes
it
was
in
her
soul
and
that
after
all
is
where
it
brings
the
greatest
good
after
that
morning
madge
and
i
frequently
walked
out
when
the
days
were
pleasant
the
autumn
was
mild
well
into
winter
time
and
by
the
end
of
november
the
transparent
cheeks
of
the
blind
girl
held
an
exquisite
tinge
of
color
and
her
form
had
a
new
grace
from
the
strength
she
had
acquired
in
exercise
we
had
grown
to
be
dear
friends
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
was
a
pleasure
for
which
i
waited
eagerly
from
day
to
day
again
i
say
thoughts
of
love
for
her
had
never
entered
my
mind
perhaps
their
absence
was
because
of
my
feeling
that
they
could
not
possibly
exist
in
her
heart
for
me
one
evening
in
november
after
the
servants
had
all
gone
to
bed
sir
george
and
i
went
to
the
kitchen
to
drink
a
hot
punch
before
retiring
for
the
night
i
drank
a
moderate
bowl
and
sat
in
a
large
chair
before
the
fire
smoking
a
pipe
of
tobacco
while
sir
george
drank
brandy
toddy
at
the
massive
oak
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sir
george
was
rapidly
growing
drunk
he
said
dawson
tells
me
that
the
queen
officers
arrested
another
of
mary
stuart
damned
french
friends
at
yesterday
count
somebody
i
ca
pronounce
their
miserable
names
can
you
not
remember
his
name
i
asked
he
may
be
a
friend
of
mine
my
remark
was
intended
to
remind
sir
george
that
his
language
was
offensive
to
me
that
is
true
malcolm
responded
sir
george
i
beg
your
pardon
i
meant
to
speak
ill
only
of
mary
meddlesome
friends
who
are
doing
more
injury
than
good
to
their
queen
cause
by
their
plotting
i
replied
no
one
can
regret
these
plots
more
than
i
do
they
certainly
will
work
great
injury
to
the
cause
they
are
intended
to
help
but
i
fear
many
innocent
men
are
made
to
suffer
for
the
few
guilty
ones
without
your
protection
for
which
i
can
not
sufficiently
thank
you
my
life
here
would
probably
be
of
short
duration
after
my
misfortunes
in
scotland
i
know
not
what
i
should
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
your
generous
welcome
i
lost
all
in
scotland
and
it
would
now
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
france
an
attempt
on
my
part
to
escape
would
result
in
my
arrest
fortune
certainly
has
turned
her
capricious
back
upon
me
with
the
one
exception
that
she
has
left
me
your
friendship
malcolm
my
boy
said
sir
george
drawing
his
chair
toward
me
that
which
you
consider
your
loss
is
my
great
gain
i
am
growing
old
and
if
you
who
have
seen
so
much
of
the
gay
world
will
be
content
to
live
with
us
and
share
our
dulness
and
our
cares
i
shall
be
the
happiest
man
in
england
i
thank
you
more
than
i
can
tell
i
said
careful
not
to
commit
myself
to
any
course
barring
my
quarrel
with
the
cursed
race
of
manners
continued
sir
george
i
have
little
to
trouble
me
and
if
you
will
remain
with
us
i
thank
god
i
may
leave
the
feud
in
good
hands
would
that
i
were
young
again
only
for
a
day
that
i
might
call
that
scoundrel
rutland
and
his
imp
of
a
son
to
account
in
the
only
manner
whereby
an
honest
man
may
have
justice
of
a
thief
there
are
but
two
of
them
malcolm
father
and
son
and
if
they
were
dead
the
damned
race
would
be
extinct
i
believe
that
sir
george
vernon
when
sober
could
not
have
spoken
in
that
fashion
even
of
his
enemies
i
found
difficulty
in
replying
to
my
cousin
remarks
so
i
said
evasively
i
certainly
am
the
most
fortunate
of
men
to
find
so
warm
a
welcome
from
you
and
so
good
a
home
as
that
which
i
have
at
haddon
hall
when
i
met
dorothy
at
the
inn
i
knew
at
once
by
her
kindness
that
my
friends
of
old
were
still
true
to
me
i
was
almost
stunned
by
dorothy
beauty
my
mention
of
dorothy
was
unintentional
and
unfortunate
i
had
shied
from
the
subject
upon
several
previous
occasions
but
sir
george
was
continually
trying
to
lead
up
to
it
this
time
my
lack
of
forethought
saved
him
the
trouble
do
you
really
think
that
doll
is
very
beautiful
so
very
beautiful
do
you
really
think
so
malcolm
said
the
old
gentleman
rubbing
his
hands
in
pride
and
pleasure
surprisingly
beautiful
i
answered
seeking
hurriedly
through
my
mind
for
an
excuse
to
turn
the
conversation
i
had
within
two
months
learned
one
vital
fact
beautiful
as
dorothy
was
i
did
not
want
her
for
my
wife
and
i
could
not
have
had
her
even
were
i
dying
for
love
the
more
i
learned
of
dorothy
and
myself
during
the
autumn
through
which
i
had
just
passed
and
i
had
learned
more
of
myself
than
i
had
been
able
to
discover
in
the
previous
years
of
my
life
the
more
clearly
i
saw
the
utter
unfitness
of
marriage
between
us
in
all
your
travels
asked
sir
george
leaning
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
and
looking
at
his
feet
between
his
hands
in
all
your
travels
and
court
life
have
you
ever
seen
a
woman
who
was
so
beautiful
as
my
girl
doll
his
pride
in
dorothy
at
times
had
a
tinge
of
egotism
and
selfishness
it
seemed
to
be
almost
the
pride
of
possession
and
ownership
my
girl
the
expression
and
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
sounded
as
if
he
had
said
my
fine
horse
my
beautiful
hall
or
my
grand
estates
dorothy
was
his
property
still
he
loved
the
girl
passionately
she
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
his
horses
cattle
halls
and
estates
put
together
and
he
loved
even
them
to
excess
he
loved
all
that
he
possessed
whatever
was
his
was
the
best
of
the
sort
such
a
love
is
apt
to
grow
up
in
the
breasts
of
men
who
have
descended
from
a
long
line
of
proprietary
ancestors
and
with
all
its
materialism
it
has
in
it
possibilities
of
great
good
the
sturdy
unflinching
patriotism
of
the
english
people
springs
from
this
source
the
thought
that
which
i
possess
is
the
best
has
beauty
and
use
in
it
though
it
leads
men
to
treat
other
men
and
alas
women
as
mere
chattels
all
this
was
passing
through
my
mind
and
i
forgot
to
answer
sir
george
question
have
you
ever
seen
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
doll
he
again
asked
i
certainly
have
never
seen
one
whose
beauty
may
even
be
compared
with
dorothy
i
answered
and
she
is
young
too
continued
sir
george
she
is
not
yet
nineteen
that
is
very
young
i
answered
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
and
she
will
be
rich
some
day
very
rich
i
am
called
of
the
peak
you
know
and
there
are
not
three
estates
in
derbyshire
which
if
combined
would
equal
mine
that
is
true
cousin
i
answered
and
i
rejoice
in
your
good
fortune
dorothy
will
have
it
all
one
of
these
days
all
all
continued
my
cousin
still
looking
at
his
feet
after
a
long
pause
during
which
sir
george
took
several
libations
from
his
bowl
of
toddy
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
so
dorothy
is
the
most
beautiful
girl
and
the
richest
heiress
you
know
indeed
she
is
i
responded
knowing
full
well
what
he
was
leading
up
to
realizing
that
in
spite
of
me
he
would
now
speak
his
mind
i
made
no
attempt
to
turn
the
current
of
the
conversation
after
another
long
pause
and
after
several
more
draughts
from
the
bowl
my
old
friend
and
benefactor
said
you
may
remember
a
little
conversation
between
us
when
you
were
last
at
haddon
six
or
seven
years
ago
about
about
dorothy
you
remember
i
of
course
dared
not
pretend
that
i
had
forgotten
yes
i
remember
i
responded
what
do
you
think
of
the
proposition
by
this
time
asked
sir
george
dorothy
and
all
she
will
inherit
shall
be
yours
stop
stop
sir
george
i
exclaimed
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
no
one
but
a
prince
or
a
great
peer
of
the
realm
is
worthy
of
aspiring
to
dorothy
hand
when
she
is
ready
to
marry
you
should
take
her
to
london
court
where
she
can
make
her
choice
from
among
the
nobles
of
our
land
there
is
not
a
marriageable
duke
or
earl
in
england
who
would
not
eagerly
seek
the
girl
for
a
wife
my
dear
cousin
your
generosity
overwhelms
me
but
it
must
not
be
thought
of
i
am
utterly
unworthy
of
her
in
person
age
and
position
no
no
but
listen
to
me
malcolm
responded
sir
george
your
modesty
which
in
truth
i
did
not
know
you
possessed
is
pleasing
to
me
but
i
have
reasons
of
my
own
for
wishing
that
you
should
marry
dorothy
i
want
my
estates
to
remain
in
the
vernon
name
and
one
day
you
or
your
children
will
make
my
house
and
my
name
noble
you
and
dorothy
shall
go
to
court
and
between
you
damme
if
you
ca
win
a
dukedom
i
am
no
prophet
you
would
not
object
to
change
your
faith
would
you
oh
no
i
responded
of
course
i
should
not
object
to
that
of
course
not
i
knew
you
were
no
fool
said
sir
george
age
why
you
are
only
years
old
little
more
than
a
matured
boy
i
prefer
you
to
any
man
in
england
for
dorothy
husband
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
kindness
i
returned
feeling
that
i
was
being
stranded
on
a
very
dangerous
shore
amidst
wealth
and
beauty
tut
tut
there
no
kindness
in
it
returned
my
cousin
i
do
not
offer
you
dorothy
hand
from
an
unselfish
motive
i
have
told
you
one
motive
but
there
is
another
and
a
little
condition
besides
malcolm
the
brandy
sir
george
had
been
drinking
had
sent
the
devil
to
his
brain
what
is
the
condition
i
asked
overjoyed
to
hear
that
there
was
one
the
old
man
leaned
toward
me
and
a
fierce
blackness
overclouded
his
face
i
am
told
malcolm
that
you
have
few
equals
in
swordsmanship
and
that
the
duello
is
not
new
to
you
is
it
true
i
believe
i
may
say
it
is
true
i
answered
i
have
fought
successfully
with
some
of
the
most
noted
duellists
of
enough
enough
now
this
is
the
condition
malcolm
a
welcome
one
to
you
i
am
sure
a
welcome
one
to
any
brave
man
his
eyes
gleamed
with
fire
and
hatred
quarrel
with
rutland
and
his
son
and
kill
both
of
them
i
felt
like
recoiling
from
the
old
fiend
i
had
often
quarrelled
and
fought
but
thank
god
never
in
cold
blood
and
with
deliberate
intent
to
do
murder
then
dorothy
and
all
i
possess
shall
be
yours
said
sir
george
the
old
one
will
be
an
easy
victim
the
young
one
they
say
prides
himself
on
his
prowess
i
do
not
know
with
what
cause
i
have
never
seen
him
fight
in
fact
i
have
never
seen
the
fellow
at
all
he
has
lived
at
london
court
since
he
was
a
child
and
has
seldom
if
ever
visited
this
part
of
the
country
he
was
a
page
both
to
edward
vi
and
to
queen
mary
why
elizabeth
keeps
the
damned
traitor
at
court
to
plot
against
her
is
more
than
i
can
understand
do
the
conditions
suit
you
malcolm
asked
sir
george
piercing
me
with
his
eyes
i
did
not
respond
and
he
continued
all
i
ask
is
your
promise
to
kill
rutland
and
his
son
at
the
first
opportunity
i
care
not
how
the
marriage
may
come
off
at
once
it
ca
take
place
too
soon
to
please
me
i
could
not
answer
for
a
time
the
power
to
speak
and
to
think
had
left
me
to
accept
sir
george
offer
was
out
of
the
question
to
refuse
it
would
be
to
give
offence
beyond
reparation
to
my
only
friend
and
you
know
what
that
would
have
meant
to
me
my
refuge
was
dorothy
i
knew
however
willing
i
might
be
or
might
appear
to
be
dorothy
would
save
me
the
trouble
and
danger
of
refusing
her
hand
so
i
said
we
have
not
consulted
dorothy
perhaps
her
inclinations
doll
inclinations
be
damned
i
have
always
been
kind
and
indulgent
to
her
and
she
is
a
dutiful
obedient
daughter
my
wish
and
command
in
this
affair
will
furnish
inclinations
enough
for
doll
but
sir
george
i
remonstrated
i
would
not
accept
the
hand
of
dorothy
nor
of
any
woman
unless
she
desired
it
i
could
not
i
could
not
if
doll
consents
i
am
to
understand
that
you
accept
asked
sir
george
i
saw
no
way
out
of
the
dilemma
and
to
gain
time
i
said
few
men
in
their
right
mind
would
refuse
so
flattering
an
offer
unless
there
were
a
most
potent
reason
and
i
i
good
good
i
shall
go
to
bed
happy
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
rutlands
will
soon
be
out
of
my
path
there
is
a
retribution
in
our
evil
passions
which
never
fails
to
operate
one
who
hates
must
suffer
and
sir
george
for
years
had
paid
the
penalty
night
and
day
unconscious
that
his
pain
was
of
his
own
making
before
we
parted
i
said
this
is
a
delicate
matter
with
reference
to
dorothy
and
i
insist
that
you
give
me
time
to
win
if
possible
her
kindly
regard
before
you
express
to
her
your
wish
nonsense
nonsense
malcolm
i
tell
the
girl
about
it
in
the
morning
and
save
you
the
trouble
the
women
will
want
to
make
some
new
gowns
and
but
i
interrupted
emphatically
i
will
not
have
it
so
it
is
every
man
sweet
privilege
to
woo
the
woman
of
his
choice
in
his
own
way
it
is
not
a
trouble
to
me
it
is
a
pleasure
and
it
is
every
woman
right
to
be
wooed
by
the
man
who
seeks
her
i
again
insist
that
i
only
shall
speak
to
dorothy
on
this
subject
at
least
i
demand
that
i
be
allowed
to
speak
first
that
all
damned
nonsense
responded
sir
george
but
if
you
will
have
it
so
well
and
good
take
your
own
course
i
suppose
it
the
fashion
at
court
the
good
old
country
way
suits
me
a
girl
father
tells
her
whom
she
is
to
marry
and
by
gad
she
does
it
without
a
word
and
is
glad
to
get
a
man
english
girls
obey
their
parents
they
know
what
to
expect
if
they
do
the
lash
by
god
and
the
dungeon
under
the
keep
your
roundabout
method
is
all
right
for
tenants
and
peasants
but
among
people
who
possess
estates
and
who
control
vast
interests
girls
are
girls
are
well
they
are
born
and
brought
up
to
obey
and
to
help
forward
the
interests
of
their
houses
the
old
man
was
growing
very
drunk
and
after
a
long
pause
he
continued
have
your
own
way
malcolm
but
do
waste
time
now
that
the
matter
is
settled
i
want
to
get
it
off
my
hands
quickly
i
shall
speak
to
dorothy
on
the
subject
at
the
first
favorable
opportunity
i
responded
but
i
warn
you
sir
george
that
if
dorothy
proves
disinclined
to
marry
me
i
will
not
accept
her
hand
never
fear
for
doll
she
will
be
all
right
and
we
parted
doll
all
right
had
he
only
known
how
very
far
from
all
right
dorothy
was
he
would
have
slept
little
that
night
this
brings
me
to
the
other
change
of
which
i
spoke
the
change
in
dorothy
change
it
was
a
metamorphosis
a
fortnight
after
the
scene
at
the
peacock
i
accidentally
discovered
a
drawing
made
by
dorothy
of
a
man
with
a
cigarro
in
his
mouth
the
girl
snatched
the
paper
from
my
hands
and
blushed
convincingly
it
is
a
caricature
of
of
him
she
said
she
smiled
and
evidently
was
willing
to
talk
upon
the
subject
of
him
i
declined
the
topic
this
happened
a
month
or
more
previous
to
my
conversation
with
sir
george
concerning
dorothy
a
few
days
after
my
discovery
of
the
cigarro
picture
dorothy
and
i
were
out
on
the
terrace
together
frequently
when
she
was
with
me
she
would
try
to
lead
the
conversation
to
the
topic
which
i
well
knew
was
in
her
mind
if
not
in
her
heart
at
all
times
she
would
speak
of
our
first
meeting
at
the
peacock
and
would
use
every
artifice
to
induce
me
to
bring
up
the
subject
which
she
was
eager
to
discuss
but
i
always
failed
her
on
the
day
mentioned
when
we
were
together
on
the
terrace
after
repeated
failures
to
induce
me
to
speak
upon
the
desired
topic
she
said
i
suppose
you
never
meet
meet
him
when
you
ride
out
whom
dorothy
i
asked
the
gentleman
with
the
cigarro
she
responded
laughing
nervously
no
i
answered
i
know
nothing
of
him
the
subject
was
dropped
at
another
time
she
said
he
was
in
the
village
overhaddon
yesterday
then
i
knew
who
him
was
how
do
you
know
i
asked
jennie
faxton
the
farrier
daughter
told
me
she
often
comes
to
the
hall
to
serve
me
she
likes
to
act
as
my
maid
and
is
devoted
to
me
did
he
send
any
word
to
you
i
asked
at
a
venture
the
girl
blushed
and
hung
her
head
she
responded
what
was
it
dorothy
i
asked
gently
you
may
trust
me
he
sent
no
word
to
me
the
girl
responded
jennie
said
she
heard
two
gentlemen
talking
about
me
in
front
of
the
farrier
shop
and
one
of
them
said
something
about
oh
i
do
know
what
it
was
i
ca
tell
you
it
was
all
nonsense
and
of
course
he
did
not
mean
it
tell
me
all
dorothy
i
said
seeing
that
she
really
wanted
to
speak
oh
he
said
something
about
having
seen
sir
george
vernon
daughter
at
rowsley
and
and
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
said
i
am
too
full
of
shame
if
her
cheeks
told
the
truth
she
certainly
was
full
of
shame
tell
me
all
sweet
cousin
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
said
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
in
quick
surprise
with
a
look
of
suspicion
you
may
trust
me
dorothy
i
say
it
again
you
may
trust
me
he
spoke
of
my
beauty
and
called
it
marvellous
said
the
girl
he
said
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
not
another
woman
oh
i
ca
tell
you
yes
yes
go
on
dorothy
i
insisted
he
said
she
continued
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
me
day
or
night
since
he
had
first
seen
me
at
rowsley
that
i
had
bewitched
him
and
and
then
the
other
gentleman
said
do
play
with
fire
it
will
burn
you
nothing
good
can
come
of
it
for
you
did
jennie
know
who
the
gentleman
was
i
asked
no
returned
dorothy
how
do
you
know
who
he
was
jennie
described
him
she
said
how
did
she
describe
him
i
asked
she
said
he
was
he
was
the
handsomest
man
in
the
world
and
and
that
he
affected
her
so
powerfully
she
fell
in
love
with
him
in
spite
of
herself
the
little
devil
to
dare
you
see
that
describes
him
perfectly
i
laughed
outright
and
the
girl
blushed
painfully
it
does
describe
him
she
said
petulantly
you
know
it
does
no
one
can
gainsay
that
he
is
wonderfully
dangerously
handsome
i
believe
the
woman
does
not
live
who
could
refrain
from
feasting
her
eyes
on
his
noble
beauty
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
again
again
tears
were
in
her
voice
and
almost
in
her
eyes
dorothy
my
god
dorothy
i
exclaimed
in
terror
yes
yes
my
god
dorothy
she
responded
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sighing
deeply
as
she
dropped
her
head
and
left
me
yes
yes
my
god
dorothy
the
helpless
iron
and
the
terrible
loadstone
the
passive
seed
the
dissolving
cloud
and
the
falling
rain
less
than
a
week
after
the
above
conversation
dorothy
madge
and
i
were
riding
from
yulegrave
church
up
to
the
village
of
overhaddon
which
lies
one
mile
across
the
hills
from
haddon
hall
my
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
and
we
stopped
at
faxton
shop
to
have
him
shod
the
town
well
is
in
the
middle
of
an
open
space
called
by
the
villagers
the
open
around
which
are
clustered
the
houses
and
shops
that
constitute
the
village
the
girls
were
mounted
and
i
was
standing
beside
them
in
front
of
the
farrier
waiting
for
my
horse
jennie
faxton
a
wild
unkempt
girl
of
sixteen
was
standing
in
silent
admiration
near
dorothy
our
backs
were
turned
toward
the
well
suddenly
a
light
came
into
jennie
face
and
she
plucked
dorothy
by
the
skirt
of
her
habit
look
mistress
look
look
there
by
the
well
said
jennie
in
a
whisper
dorothy
looked
toward
the
well
i
also
turned
my
head
and
beheld
my
friend
sir
john
holding
a
bucket
of
water
for
his
horse
to
drink
i
had
not
seen
him
since
we
parted
at
the
peacock
and
i
did
not
show
that
i
recognized
him
i
feared
to
betray
our
friendship
to
the
villagers
they
however
did
not
know
sir
john
and
i
need
not
have
been
so
cautious
but
dorothy
and
madge
were
with
me
and
of
course
i
dared
not
make
any
demonstration
of
acquaintanceship
with
the
enemy
of
our
house
dorothy
watched
john
closely
and
when
he
was
ready
to
mount
she
struck
her
horse
with
the
whip
and
boldly
rode
to
the
well
may
i
ask
you
to
give
my
mare
water
she
said
certainly
ah
i
beg
pardon
i
did
not
understand
answered
sir
john
confusedly
john
the
polished
courtier
felt
the
confusion
of
a
country
rustic
in
the
presence
of
this
wonderful
girl
whose
knowledge
of
life
had
been
acquired
within
the
precincts
of
haddon
hall
yet
the
inexperienced
girl
was
and
unconfused
while
the
wits
of
the
courtier
who
had
often
calmly
flattered
the
queen
had
all
gone
she
repeated
her
request
certainly
returned
john
i
i
knew
what
you
said
but
but
you
surprise
me
yes
said
brazen
dorothy
i
have
surprised
myself
john
in
his
haste
to
satisfy
dolcy
thirst
dashed
the
water
against
the
skirt
of
dorothy
habit
and
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
do
not
mention
it
said
dorothy
i
like
a
damp
habit
the
wind
can
not
so
easily
blow
it
about
and
she
laughed
as
she
shook
the
garment
to
free
it
of
the
water
dolcy
refused
to
drink
and
dorothy
having
no
excuse
to
linger
at
the
well
drew
up
her
reins
and
prepared
to
leave
while
doing
so
she
said
do
you
often
come
to
overhaddon
her
eager
eyes
shone
like
red
coals
and
looking
at
john
she
awaited
smilingly
his
response
seldom
answered
john
not
often
i
mean
every
day
that
is
if
i
may
come
any
one
may
come
to
the
village
whenever
he
wishes
to
do
so
responded
dorothy
laughing
too
plainly
at
sir
john
confusion
is
it
seldom
or
not
often
or
every
day
that
you
come
in
her
overconfidence
she
was
chaffing
him
he
caught
the
tone
and
looked
quickly
into
the
girl
eyes
her
gaze
could
not
stand
against
john
for
a
moment
and
the
long
lashes
drooped
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
fierce
light
of
his
i
said
i
would
come
to
overhaddon
every
day
he
returned
and
although
i
must
have
appeared
very
foolish
in
my
confusion
you
can
not
misunderstand
the
full
meaning
of
my
words
in
john
boldness
and
in
the
ring
of
his
voice
dorothy
felt
the
touch
of
her
master
against
whom
she
well
knew
all
the
poor
force
she
could
muster
would
be
utterly
helpless
she
was
frightened
and
said
i
i
must
go
when
she
rode
away
from
him
she
thought
i
believed
because
of
his
confusion
that
i
was
the
stronger
i
could
not
stand
against
him
for
a
moment
holy
virgin
what
have
i
done
and
to
what
am
i
coming
you
may
now
understand
the
magnitude
of
the
task
which
sir
george
had
set
for
me
when
he
bade
me
marry
his
daughter
and
kill
the
rutlands
i
might
perform
the
feat
but
dragon
fighting
would
be
mere
play
compared
with
the
first
while
the
girl
heart
was
filled
with
the
image
of
another
man
i
walked
forward
to
meet
dorothy
leaving
madge
near
the
farrier
shop
dorothy
are
you
mad
what
have
you
been
doing
i
asked
could
you
not
see
she
answered
under
her
breath
casting
a
look
of
warning
toward
madge
and
a
glance
of
defiance
at
me
are
you
too
blind
could
you
not
see
what
i
was
doing
yes
i
responded
then
why
do
you
ask
as
i
went
back
to
madge
i
saw
john
ride
out
of
the
village
by
the
south
road
i
afterward
learned
that
he
rode
gloomily
back
to
rutland
castle
cursing
himself
for
a
fool
his
duty
to
his
father
which
with
him
was
a
strong
motive
his
family
pride
his
self
love
his
sense
of
caution
all
told
him
that
he
was
walking
into
trouble
he
had
tried
to
remain
away
from
the
vicinity
of
haddon
hall
but
despite
his
and
he
had
made
several
visits
to
rowsley
and
to
overhaddon
and
at
one
time
had
ridden
to
bakewell
passing
haddon
hall
on
his
way
thither
he
had
as
much
business
in
the
moon
as
at
overhaddon
yet
he
told
dorothy
he
would
be
at
the
village
every
day
and
she
it
seemed
was
only
too
willing
to
give
him
opportunities
to
transact
his
momentous
affairs
as
the
floating
cloud
to
the
fathomless
blue
as
the
seed
to
the
earth
as
the
iron
to
the
lodestone
so
was
dorothy
unto
john
thus
you
see
our
beautiful
pitcher
went
to
the
well
and
was
broken
chapter
iv
the
golden
heart
the
day
after
dorothy
first
meeting
with
manners
at
overhaddon
she
was
restless
and
nervous
and
about
the
hour
of
three
in
the
afternoon
she
mounted
dolcy
and
rode
toward
bakewell
that
direction
i
was
sure
she
took
for
the
purpose
of
misleading
us
at
the
hall
and
i
felt
confident
she
would
when
once
out
of
sight
head
her
mare
straight
for
overhaddon
within
an
hour
dorothy
was
home
again
and
very
the
next
day
she
rode
out
in
the
morning
i
asked
her
if
i
should
ride
with
her
and
the
emphatic
no
with
which
she
answered
me
left
no
room
for
doubt
in
my
mind
concerning
her
desire
for
my
company
or
her
destination
again
she
returned
within
an
hour
and
hurried
to
her
apartments
shortly
afterward
madge
asked
me
what
dorothy
was
weeping
about
and
although
in
my
own
mind
i
was
confident
of
the
cause
of
dorothy
tears
i
of
course
did
not
give
madge
a
hint
of
my
suspicion
yet
i
then
knew
quite
as
well
as
i
now
know
that
john
notwithstanding
the
important
business
which
he
said
would
bring
him
to
overhaddon
every
day
had
forced
himself
to
remain
at
home
and
dorothy
in
consequence
suffered
from
anger
and
wounded
pride
she
had
twice
ridden
to
overhaddon
to
meet
him
she
had
done
for
his
sake
that
which
she
knew
she
should
have
left
undone
and
he
had
refused
the
offering
a
smarting
conscience
an
aching
heart
and
a
breast
full
of
anger
were
dorothy
rewards
for
her
evil
doing
the
day
after
her
second
futile
trip
to
overhaddon
i
to
test
her
spoke
of
john
she
turned
upon
me
with
the
black
look
of
a
fury
and
hurled
her
words
at
me
never
again
speak
his
despised
name
in
my
hearing
curse
him
and
his
whole
race
now
what
has
he
been
doing
i
asked
i
tell
you
i
will
not
speak
of
him
nor
will
i
listen
to
you
and
she
dashed
away
from
me
like
a
fiery
whirlwind
four
or
five
days
later
the
girl
rode
out
again
upon
dolcy
she
was
away
from
home
for
four
long
hours
and
when
she
returned
she
was
so
gentle
sweet
and
happy
that
she
was
willing
to
kiss
every
one
in
the
household
from
welch
the
butcher
to
sir
george
she
was
radiant
she
clung
to
madge
and
to
me
and
sang
and
romped
through
the
house
like
dorothy
of
old
madge
said
i
am
so
glad
you
are
feeling
better
dorothy
then
speaking
to
me
she
has
been
ill
for
several
days
she
could
not
sleep
dorothy
looked
quickly
over
to
me
gave
a
little
shrug
to
her
shoulders
bent
forward
her
face
which
was
red
with
blushing
and
kissed
madge
lingeringly
upon
the
lips
the
events
of
dorothy
trip
i
soon
learned
from
her
the
little
scene
between
dorothy
madge
and
myself
after
joyful
return
occurred
a
week
before
the
momentous
conversation
between
sir
george
and
me
concerning
my
union
with
his
house
ten
days
after
sir
george
had
offered
me
his
daughter
and
his
lands
he
brought
up
the
subject
again
he
and
i
were
walking
on
the
ridge
of
bowling
green
hill
i
am
glad
you
are
making
such
fair
progress
with
doll
said
sir
george
have
you
yet
spoken
to
her
upon
the
subject
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
i
had
made
any
progress
in
fact
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
taken
a
single
step
i
was
curious
to
learn
in
what
the
progress
consisted
so
i
said
i
have
not
spoken
to
dorothy
yet
concerning
the
marriage
and
i
fear
that
i
have
made
no
progress
at
all
she
certainly
is
friendly
enough
to
me
but
i
should
say
that
the
gift
from
you
she
exhibited
would
indicate
considerable
progress
said
sir
george
casting
an
expressive
glance
toward
me
what
gift
i
stupidly
inquired
the
golden
heart
you
rascal
she
said
you
told
her
it
had
belonged
to
your
mother
holy
mother
of
truth
thought
i
pray
give
your
especial
care
to
my
cousin
dorothy
she
needs
it
sir
george
thrust
at
my
side
with
his
thumb
and
continued
do
deny
it
malcolm
damme
you
are
as
shy
as
a
boy
in
this
matter
but
perhaps
you
know
better
than
i
how
to
go
at
her
i
was
thinking
only
the
other
day
that
your
course
was
probably
the
right
one
doll
i
suspect
has
a
dash
of
her
old
father
temper
and
she
may
prove
a
little
troublesome
unless
we
let
her
think
she
is
having
her
own
way
oh
there
is
nothing
like
knowing
how
to
handle
them
malcolm
just
let
them
think
they
are
having
their
own
way
and
and
save
trouble
doll
may
have
more
of
her
father
in
her
than
i
suspect
and
perhaps
it
is
well
for
us
to
move
slowly
you
will
be
able
to
judge
but
you
must
not
move
too
slowly
if
in
the
end
she
should
prove
stubborn
we
will
break
her
will
or
break
her
neck
i
would
rather
have
a
daughter
in
bakewell
churchyard
than
a
wilful
stubborn
disobedient
huzzy
in
haddon
hall
illustration
sir
george
had
been
drinking
and
my
slip
concerning
the
gift
passed
unnoticed
by
him
i
am
sure
you
well
know
how
to
proceed
in
this
matter
but
do
be
too
cautious
malcolm
the
best
woman
living
loves
to
be
stormed
trust
me
i
answered
i
shall
speak
and
my
words
unconsciously
sank
away
to
thought
as
thought
often
and
inconveniently
at
times
grows
into
words
dorothy
dorothy
said
the
thoughts
again
and
again
where
came
you
by
the
golden
heart
and
where
learned
you
so
villanously
to
lie
from
love
was
the
response
whispered
by
the
sighing
winds
from
love
that
makes
men
and
women
like
unto
gods
and
teaches
them
the
tricks
of
devils
from
love
murmured
the
dry
rustling
leaves
and
the
rugged
trees
from
love
sighed
the
fleecy
clouds
as
they
floated
in
the
sweet
restful
azure
of
the
vaulted
sky
from
love
cried
the
mighty
sun
as
he
poured
his
light
and
heat
upon
the
eager
world
to
give
it
life
i
would
not
give
a
fig
for
a
woman
however
who
would
not
lie
herself
black
in
the
face
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
a
virtue
few
women
lack
one
who
would
scorn
to
lie
under
all
other
circumstances
would
but
you
understand
i
suppose
that
dorothy
had
never
before
uttered
a
real
lie
she
hated
all
that
was
evil
and
loved
all
that
was
good
till
love
came
i
quickly
invented
an
excuse
to
leave
sir
george
and
returned
to
the
hall
to
seek
dorothy
i
found
her
and
asked
her
to
accompany
me
for
a
few
minutes
that
i
might
speak
with
her
privately
we
went
out
upon
the
terrace
and
i
at
once
began
you
should
tell
me
when
i
present
you
gifts
that
i
may
not
cause
trouble
by
my
ignorance
nor
show
surprise
when
i
suddenly
learn
what
i
have
done
you
see
when
a
man
gives
a
lady
a
gift
and
he
does
not
know
it
he
is
apt
to
holy
virgin
exclaimed
dorothy
pale
with
fear
and
consternation
did
you
no
i
did
not
betray
you
but
i
came
perilously
near
it
i
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
i
tried
several
times
to
do
so
i
did
so
long
to
tell
somebody
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
speak
i
was
full
of
shame
yet
i
was
proud
and
happy
for
all
that
happened
was
good
and
pure
and
sacred
you
are
not
a
woman
you
can
not
know
but
i
do
know
i
know
that
you
saw
manners
the
other
day
and
that
he
gave
you
a
golden
heart
how
did
you
know
did
any
one
tell
me
no
i
knew
it
when
you
returned
after
five
hours
absence
looking
radiant
as
the
sun
oh
the
girl
exclaimed
with
a
startled
movement
i
also
knew
i
continued
that
at
other
times
when
you
rode
out
upon
dolcy
you
had
not
seen
him
how
did
you
know
she
asked
with
breath
by
your
i
answered
i
knew
it
was
so
i
felt
that
everybody
knew
all
that
i
had
been
doing
i
could
almost
see
father
and
madge
and
you
even
the
servants
reading
the
wickedness
written
upon
my
heart
i
knew
that
i
could
hide
it
from
nobody
tears
were
very
near
the
girl
eyes
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
our
guilty
consciences
through
which
we
see
so
plainly
our
own
evil
are
transparent
to
all
the
world
in
that
fact
lies
an
greatest
danger
said
i
preacher
fashion
but
you
need
have
no
fear
what
you
have
done
i
believe
is
suspected
by
no
one
save
me
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
rose
from
the
girl
heaving
breast
well
she
began
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
do
so
it
is
heavy
malcolm
heavy
on
my
conscience
but
i
would
not
be
rid
of
it
for
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
a
moment
since
you
told
me
that
your
conduct
was
good
and
pure
and
sacred
and
now
you
tell
me
that
it
is
heavy
on
your
conscience
does
one
grieve
dorothy
for
the
sake
of
that
which
is
good
and
pure
and
sacred
i
can
not
answer
your
question
she
replied
i
am
no
priest
but
this
i
know
i
have
done
no
evil
and
my
conscience
nevertheless
is
sore
solve
me
the
riddle
malcolm
if
you
can
i
can
not
solve
your
riddle
dorothy
i
replied
but
i
feel
sure
it
will
be
far
safer
for
each
of
us
if
you
will
tell
me
all
that
happens
hereafter
i
am
sure
you
are
right
she
responded
but
some
secrets
are
so
delicious
that
we
love
to
suck
their
sweets
alone
i
believe
however
your
advice
is
good
and
i
will
tell
you
all
that
has
happened
though
i
can
not
look
you
in
the
face
while
doing
it
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
her
face
was
red
with
blushes
she
continued
i
have
acted
most
unmaidenly
unmaidenly
perhaps
but
not
unwomanly
said
i
i
thank
you
she
said
interrupting
my
sentence
it
probably
was
well
that
she
did
so
for
i
was
about
to
add
to
act
womanly
often
means
to
get
yourself
into
mischief
and
your
friends
into
as
much
trouble
as
possible
had
i
finished
my
remark
she
would
not
have
thanked
me
well
said
the
girl
beginning
her
laggard
narrative
after
we
saw
saw
him
at
overhaddon
you
know
i
went
to
the
village
on
each
of
three
days
yes
i
know
that
also
i
said
how
did
you
but
never
mind
i
did
not
see
him
and
when
i
returned
home
i
felt
angry
and
hurt
and
and
but
never
mind
that
either
one
day
i
found
him
and
i
at
once
rode
to
the
well
where
he
was
standing
by
his
horse
he
drew
water
for
dolcy
but
the
perverse
mare
would
not
drink
a
characteristic
of
her
sex
i
muttered
what
did
you
say
asked
the
girl
nothing
she
continued
he
seemed
constrained
and
distant
in
his
manner
but
i
knew
that
is
i
thought
i
mean
i
felt
oh
you
know
he
looked
as
if
he
were
glad
to
see
me
and
i
i
oh
god
i
was
so
glad
and
happy
to
see
him
that
i
could
hardly
restrain
myself
to
act
at
all
maidenly
he
must
have
heard
my
heart
beat
i
thought
he
was
in
trouble
he
seemed
to
have
something
he
wished
to
say
to
me
he
doubtless
had
a
great
deal
he
wished
to
say
to
you
said
i
again
tempted
to
futile
irony
i
was
sure
he
had
something
to
say
the
girl
returned
seriously
he
was
in
trouble
i
knew
that
he
was
and
i
longed
to
help
him
what
trouble
i
inquired
oh
i
do
know
i
forgot
to
ask
but
he
looked
troubled
doubtless
he
was
troubled
i
responded
he
had
sufficient
cause
for
trouble
i
finished
the
sentence
to
myself
with
the
words
in
you
what
was
the
cause
of
his
trouble
she
hastily
asked
turning
her
face
toward
me
i
do
not
know
certainly
i
answered
in
a
tone
of
irony
which
should
have
pierced
an
oak
board
while
the
girl
listened
and
looked
at
me
eagerly
but
i
might
guess
what
was
it
what
was
it
let
me
hear
you
guess
she
asked
you
i
responded
laconically
i
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
yes
you
i
responded
with
emphasis
you
would
bring
trouble
to
any
man
but
to
sir
john
manners
well
if
he
intends
to
keep
up
these
meetings
with
you
it
would
be
better
for
his
peace
and
happiness
that
he
should
get
him
a
house
in
hell
for
he
would
live
there
more
happily
than
on
this
earth
that
is
a
foolish
senseless
remark
malcolm
the
girl
replied
tossing
her
head
with
a
show
of
anger
in
her
eyes
this
is
no
time
to
jest
i
suppose
i
could
not
have
convinced
her
that
i
was
not
jesting
at
first
we
did
not
speak
to
each
other
even
to
say
good
day
but
stood
by
the
well
in
silence
for
a
very
long
time
the
village
people
were
staring
at
us
and
i
felt
that
every
window
had
a
hundred
faces
in
it
and
every
face
a
hundred
eyes
you
imagined
that
said
i
because
of
your
guilty
conscience
perhaps
so
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
stood
by
the
well
in
silence
a
very
long
time
you
see
cousin
malcolm
i
was
not
the
one
who
should
speak
first
i
had
done
more
than
my
part
in
going
to
meet
him
decidedly
so
said
i
interrupting
the
interesting
narrative
when
i
could
bear
the
gaze
of
the
villagers
no
longer
i
drew
up
my
reins
and
started
to
leave
the
open
by
the
north
road
after
dolcy
had
climbed
halfway
up
north
hill
which
as
you
know
overlooks
the
village
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
sir
john
still
standing
by
the
well
resting
his
hand
upon
his
horse
mane
he
was
watching
me
i
grew
angry
and
determined
that
he
should
follow
me
even
if
i
had
to
call
him
so
i
drew
dolcy
to
a
stand
was
not
that
bold
in
me
but
wait
there
is
worse
to
come
malcolm
he
did
not
move
but
stood
like
a
statue
looking
toward
me
i
knew
that
he
wanted
to
come
so
after
a
little
time
i
i
beckoned
to
him
and
and
then
he
came
like
a
thunderbolt
oh
it
was
delicious
i
put
dolcy
to
a
gallop
for
when
he
started
toward
me
i
was
frightened
besides
i
did
not
want
him
to
overtake
me
till
we
were
out
of
the
village
but
when
once
he
had
started
he
did
not
wait
he
was
as
swift
now
as
he
had
been
slow
and
my
heart
throbbed
and
triumphed
because
of
his
eagerness
though
in
truth
i
was
afraid
of
him
dolcy
you
know
is
very
fleet
and
when
i
touched
her
with
the
whip
she
soon
put
half
a
mile
between
me
and
the
village
then
i
brought
her
to
a
walk
and
and
he
quickly
overtook
me
when
he
came
up
to
me
he
said
feared
to
follow
you
though
i
ardently
wished
to
do
so
i
dreaded
to
tell
you
my
name
lest
you
should
hate
me
sir
malcolm
at
the
peacock
said
he
would
not
disclose
to
you
my
identity
i
am
john
manners
our
fathers
are
enemies
then
i
said
to
him
is
the
reason
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
i
wished
you
to
come
to
meet
me
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
regret
and
deplore
the
feud
between
our
fathers
you
wished
me
to
come
he
course
i
did
i
answered
why
should
i
be
here
one
regrets
the
feud
between
our
houses
so
deeply
as
i
replied
sir
john
can
think
of
nothing
else
by
day
nor
can
i
dream
of
anything
else
by
night
it
is
the
greatest
cause
for
grief
and
sorrow
that
has
ever
come
into
my
life
you
see
cousin
malcolm
the
girl
continued
i
was
right
his
father
conduct
does
trouble
him
is
he
noble
and
to
see
the
evil
of
his
father
ways
i
did
not
tell
the
girl
that
sir
john
regret
for
the
feud
between
the
houses
of
manners
and
vernon
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
it
separated
him
from
her
nor
did
i
tell
her
that
he
did
not
grieve
over
his
ways
i
asked
did
sir
john
tell
you
that
he
grieved
because
of
his
not
in
set
terms
but
that
of
course
would
have
been
very
hard
for
him
to
say
i
told
you
what
he
said
and
there
could
be
no
other
meaning
to
his
words
of
course
not
i
responded
no
and
i
fairly
longed
to
reach
out
my
hand
and
clutch
him
because
because
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
was
sorrow
your
only
feeling
i
asked
the
girl
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
then
she
sobbed
gently
and
said
oh
cousin
malcolm
you
are
so
old
and
so
wise
thank
you
thought
i
a
second
daniel
come
to
judgment
at
or
solomon
and
methuselah
in
one
she
continued
tell
me
tell
me
what
is
this
terrible
thing
that
has
come
upon
me
i
seem
to
be
living
in
a
dream
i
am
burning
with
a
fever
and
a
heavy
weight
is
here
upon
my
breast
i
can
not
sleep
at
night
i
can
do
nothing
but
long
and
yearn
for
for
i
know
not
what
till
at
times
it
seems
that
some
frightful
unseen
monster
is
slowly
drawing
the
heart
out
of
my
bosom
i
think
of
of
him
at
all
times
and
i
try
to
recall
his
face
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
until
cousin
malcolm
i
tell
you
i
am
almost
mad
i
call
upon
the
holy
virgin
hour
by
hour
to
pity
me
but
she
is
pure
and
can
not
know
what
i
feel
i
hate
and
loathe
myself
to
what
am
i
coming
where
will
it
all
end
yet
i
can
do
nothing
to
save
myself
i
am
powerless
against
this
terrible
feeling
i
can
not
even
resolve
to
resist
it
it
came
upon
me
mildly
that
day
at
the
peacock
inn
when
i
first
saw
him
and
it
grows
deeper
and
stronger
day
by
day
and
alas
night
by
night
i
seem
to
have
lost
myself
in
some
strange
way
i
feel
as
if
i
had
sunk
into
him
that
he
had
absorbed
me
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
thought
i
i
believed
continued
the
girl
that
if
he
would
exert
his
will
i
might
have
relief
but
there
again
i
find
trouble
for
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
ask
him
to
will
it
the
feeling
within
me
is
like
a
sore
heart
painful
as
it
is
i
must
keep
it
without
it
i
fear
i
could
not
live
after
this
outburst
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
she
walked
by
my
side
seemingly
unconscious
that
i
was
near
her
i
had
known
for
some
time
that
dorothy
was
interested
in
manners
but
i
was
not
prepared
to
see
such
a
volcano
of
passion
i
need
not
descant
upon
the
evils
and
dangers
of
the
situation
the
thought
that
first
came
to
me
was
that
sir
george
would
surely
kill
his
daughter
before
he
would
allow
her
to
marry
a
son
of
rutland
i
was
revolving
in
my
mind
how
i
should
set
about
to
mend
the
matter
when
dorothy
again
spoke
tell
me
cousin
malcolm
can
a
man
throw
a
spell
over
a
woman
and
bewitch
her
i
do
not
know
i
have
never
heard
of
a
man
witch
i
responded
no
asked
the
girl
but
i
continued
i
do
know
that
a
woman
may
bewitch
a
man
john
manners
i
doubt
not
could
also
testify
knowingly
on
the
subject
by
this
time
oh
do
you
think
he
is
bewitched
cried
dorothy
grasping
my
arm
and
looking
eagerly
into
my
face
if
i
could
bewitch
him
i
would
do
it
i
would
deal
with
the
devil
gladly
to
learn
the
art
i
would
not
care
for
my
soul
i
do
not
fear
the
future
the
present
is
a
dearer
to
me
than
either
the
past
or
the
future
i
care
not
what
comes
hereafter
i
want
him
now
ah
malcolm
pity
my
shame
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
after
a
moment
continued
i
am
not
myself
i
belong
not
to
myself
but
if
i
knew
that
he
also
suffers
i
do
believe
my
pain
would
be
less
i
think
you
may
set
your
heart
at
rest
upon
that
point
i
answered
he
doubtless
also
suffers
i
hope
so
she
responded
unconscious
of
the
selfish
wish
she
had
expressed
if
he
does
not
i
know
not
what
will
be
my
fate
i
saw
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
assuring
her
that
john
also
suffered
and
i
determined
to
correct
it
later
on
if
possible
dorothy
was
silent
and
i
said
you
have
not
told
me
about
the
golden
heart
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
we
rode
for
two
hours
or
more
and
talked
of
the
weather
and
the
scenery
until
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
concerning
either
then
sir
john
told
me
of
the
court
in
london
where
he
has
always
lived
and
of
the
queen
whose
hair
he
says
is
red
but
not
at
all
like
mine
i
wondered
if
he
would
speak
of
the
beauty
of
my
hair
but
he
did
not
he
only
looked
at
it
then
he
told
me
about
the
scottish
queen
whom
he
once
met
when
he
was
on
an
embassy
to
edinburgh
he
described
her
marvellous
beauty
and
i
believe
he
sympathizes
with
her
cause
that
is
with
her
cause
in
scotland
he
says
she
has
no
good
cause
in
england
he
is
true
to
our
queen
well
well
he
talked
so
interestingly
that
i
could
have
listened
a
whole
month
yes
all
my
life
i
suppose
you
could
i
said
yes
she
continued
but
i
could
not
remain
longer
from
home
and
when
i
left
him
he
asked
me
to
accept
a
keepsake
which
had
belonged
to
his
mother
as
a
token
that
there
should
be
no
feud
between
him
and
me
and
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
golden
heart
studded
with
diamonds
and
pierced
by
a
white
silver
arrow
i
of
course
accepted
it
then
we
said
and
i
put
dolcy
to
a
gallop
that
she
might
speedily
take
me
out
of
temptation
have
you
ridden
to
overhaddon
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
manners
many
times
since
he
gave
you
the
heart
i
queried
what
would
you
call
times
she
asked
drooping
her
head
every
day
i
said
interrogatively
she
nodded
yes
but
i
have
seen
him
only
once
since
the
day
when
he
gave
me
the
heart
nothing
i
could
say
would
do
justice
to
the
subject
so
i
remained
silent
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
your
father
came
to
know
of
the
golden
heart
i
said
it
was
this
way
one
morning
while
i
was
looking
at
the
heart
father
came
upon
me
suddenly
before
i
could
conceal
it
he
asked
me
to
tell
him
how
i
came
by
the
jewel
and
in
my
fright
and
confusion
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
so
i
told
him
you
had
given
it
to
me
he
promised
not
to
speak
to
you
about
the
heart
but
he
did
not
keep
his
word
he
seemed
pleased
doubtless
he
was
pleased
said
i
hoping
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
so
near
to
sir
george
heart
but
now
farther
than
ever
from
mine
the
girl
unsuspectingly
helped
me
father
asked
if
you
had
spoken
upon
a
subject
of
great
interest
to
him
and
to
yourself
and
i
told
him
you
had
not
he
does
speak
said
father
most
kindly
want
you
to
grant
his
request
and
i
will
grant
it
cousin
malcolm
she
looked
in
my
face
and
continued
i
will
grant
your
request
whatever
it
may
be
you
are
the
dearest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
and
mine
is
the
most
loving
and
lovable
father
that
girl
ever
had
it
almost
breaks
my
heart
when
i
think
of
his
suffering
should
he
learn
of
what
i
have
done
that
which
i
just
told
to
you
she
walked
beside
me
meditatively
for
a
moment
and
said
i
will
return
sir
gift
and
i
will
never
see
him
again
i
felt
sure
that
by
she
would
have
repented
of
her
repentance
but
i
soon
discovered
that
i
had
given
her
much
more
time
than
she
needed
to
perform
that
trifling
feminine
gymnastic
for
with
the
next
breath
she
said
i
have
no
means
of
returning
the
heart
i
must
see
him
once
more
and
i
will
give
give
it
it
back
to
to
him
and
will
tell
him
that
i
can
see
him
never
again
she
scarcely
had
sufficient
resolution
to
finish
telling
her
intention
whence
then
would
come
the
will
to
put
it
in
action
forty
thieves
could
not
have
stolen
the
heart
from
her
though
she
thought
she
was
honest
when
she
said
she
would
take
it
to
him
dorothy
said
i
seriously
but
kindly
have
you
and
sir
john
spoken
of
she
evidently
knew
that
i
meant
to
say
of
love
for
she
interrupted
me
but
surely
he
knows
and
i
i
think
at
least
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
i
will
take
the
heart
to
sir
john
said
i
interrupting
her
angrily
and
you
need
not
see
him
again
he
has
acted
like
a
fool
and
a
knave
he
is
a
villain
dorothy
and
i
will
tell
him
as
much
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
i
have
at
my
command
dare
you
speak
against
him
or
to
him
upon
the
subject
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
blazing
with
anger
you
you
asked
for
my
confidence
and
i
gave
it
you
said
i
might
trust
you
and
i
did
so
and
now
you
show
me
that
i
am
a
fool
indeed
traitor
my
dear
cousin
said
i
seeing
that
she
spoke
the
truth
in
charging
me
with
bad
faith
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
i
swear
it
by
my
knighthood
you
may
trust
me
i
spoke
in
anger
but
sir
john
has
acted
badly
that
you
can
not
gainsay
you
too
have
done
great
evil
that
also
you
can
not
gainsay
no
said
the
girl
dejectedly
i
can
not
deny
it
but
the
greatest
evil
is
yet
to
come
you
must
do
something
i
continued
you
must
take
some
decisive
step
that
will
break
this
connection
and
you
must
take
the
step
at
once
if
you
would
save
yourself
from
the
frightful
evil
that
is
in
store
for
you
forgive
me
for
what
i
said
sweet
cousin
my
angry
words
sprang
from
my
love
for
you
and
my
fear
for
your
future
no
girl
heart
was
more
tender
to
the
influence
of
kindness
than
dorothy
no
heart
was
more
obdurate
to
unkindness
or
peremptory
command
my
words
softened
her
at
once
and
she
tried
to
smother
the
anger
i
had
aroused
but
she
did
not
entirely
succeed
and
a
spark
remained
which
in
a
moment
or
two
created
a
disastrous
conflagration
you
shall
hear
she
walked
by
my
side
in
silence
for
a
little
time
and
then
spoke
in
a
low
slightly
sullen
tone
which
told
of
her
effort
to
smother
her
resentment
i
do
trust
you
cousin
malcolm
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
ask
of
me
your
request
is
granted
before
it
is
made
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
dorothy
i
replied
it
is
a
request
your
father
ardently
desires
me
to
make
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
speak
to
you
concerning
the
subject
in
the
way
i
wish
i
could
not
ask
her
to
marry
me
and
tell
her
with
the
same
breath
that
i
did
not
want
her
for
my
wife
i
felt
i
must
wait
for
a
further
opportunity
to
say
that
i
spoke
only
because
her
father
had
required
me
to
do
so
and
that
circumstances
forced
me
to
put
the
burden
of
refusal
upon
her
i
well
knew
that
she
would
refuse
me
and
then
i
intended
to
explain
why
what
is
it
all
about
asked
the
girl
in
surprise
suspecting
i
believe
what
was
to
follow
it
is
this
your
father
is
anxious
that
his
vast
estates
shall
not
pass
out
of
the
family
name
and
he
wishes
you
to
be
my
wife
so
that
your
children
may
bear
the
loved
name
of
vernon
i
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
inauspicious
time
to
speak
she
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
in
surprise
turning
to
scorn
then
she
spoke
in
tones
of
withering
contempt
tell
my
father
that
i
shall
never
bear
a
child
by
the
name
of
vernon
i
would
rather
go
barren
to
my
grave
ah
that
is
why
sir
john
manners
is
a
villain
that
is
why
a
decisive
step
should
be
taken
that
is
why
you
come
to
my
father
house
after
you
have
squandered
your
patrimony
and
have
spent
a
dissolute
youth
in
profligacy
after
the
women
of
the
class
you
have
known
will
have
no
more
of
you
but
choose
younger
men
you
who
are
old
enough
to
be
my
father
come
here
and
seek
your
fortune
as
your
father
sought
his
by
marriage
i
do
not
believe
that
my
father
wishes
me
to
to
marry
you
you
have
wheedled
him
into
giving
his
consent
when
he
was
in
his
cups
but
even
if
he
wished
it
with
all
his
heart
i
would
not
marry
you
then
she
turned
and
walked
rapidly
toward
the
hall
her
fierce
words
angered
me
for
in
the
light
of
my
real
intentions
her
scorn
was
uncalled
for
and
her
language
was
insulting
beyond
endurance
for
a
moment
or
two
the
hot
blood
rushed
to
my
brain
and
rendered
me
incapable
of
intelligent
thought
but
as
dorothy
walked
from
me
i
realized
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
to
put
myself
right
with
her
when
my
fit
of
temper
had
cooled
and
when
i
considered
that
the
girl
did
not
know
my
real
intentions
i
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
in
view
of
all
that
had
just
passed
between
us
concerning
sir
john
manners
and
in
fact
in
view
of
all
that
she
had
seen
and
could
see
her
anger
was
justifiable
i
called
to
her
dorothy
wait
a
moment
you
have
not
heard
all
i
have
to
say
she
hastened
her
pace
a
few
rapid
strides
brought
me
to
her
side
i
was
provoked
not
at
her
words
for
they
were
almost
justifiable
but
because
she
would
not
stop
to
hear
me
i
grasped
her
rudely
by
the
arm
and
said
listen
till
i
have
finished
i
will
not
she
answered
viciously
do
not
touch
me
i
still
held
her
by
the
arm
and
said
i
do
not
wish
to
marry
you
i
spoke
only
because
your
father
desired
me
to
do
so
and
because
my
refusal
to
speak
would
have
offended
him
beyond
any
power
of
mine
to
make
amends
i
could
not
tell
you
that
i
did
not
wish
you
for
my
wife
until
you
had
given
me
an
opportunity
i
was
forced
to
throw
the
burden
of
refusal
upon
you
that
is
but
a
ruse
a
transparent
flimsy
ruse
responded
the
stubborn
angry
girl
endeavoring
to
draw
her
arm
from
my
grasp
it
is
not
a
ruse
i
answered
if
you
will
listen
to
me
and
will
help
me
by
acting
as
i
suggest
we
may
between
us
bring
your
father
to
our
way
of
thinking
and
i
may
still
be
able
to
retain
his
friendship
what
is
your
great
plan
asked
dorothy
in
a
voice
such
as
one
might
expect
to
hear
from
a
piece
of
ice
i
have
formed
no
plan
as
yet
i
replied
although
i
have
thought
of
several
until
we
can
determine
upon
one
i
suggest
that
you
permit
me
to
say
to
your
father
that
i
have
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
and
that
the
subject
has
come
upon
you
so
suddenly
that
you
wish
a
short
time
a
fortnight
or
a
month
in
which
to
consider
your
answer
that
is
but
a
ruse
i
say
to
gain
time
she
answered
contemptuously
i
do
not
wish
one
moment
in
which
to
consider
you
already
have
my
answer
i
should
think
you
had
had
enough
do
you
desire
more
of
the
same
sort
a
little
of
such
treatment
should
go
a
long
way
with
a
man
possessed
of
one
spark
of
honor
or
her
language
would
have
angered
a
sheep
if
you
will
not
listen
to
me
i
answered
thoroughly
aroused
and
careless
of
consequences
go
to
your
father
tell
him
i
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
and
that
you
scorned
my
suit
then
take
the
consequences
he
has
always
been
gentle
and
tender
to
you
because
there
has
been
no
conflict
cross
his
desires
and
you
will
learn
a
fact
of
which
you
have
never
dreamed
you
have
seen
the
manner
in
which
he
treats
others
who
oppose
him
you
will
learn
that
with
you
too
he
can
be
one
of
the
cruelest
and
most
violent
of
men
you
slander
my
father
i
will
go
to
him
as
you
advise
and
will
tell
him
that
i
would
not
marry
you
if
you
wore
the
english
crown
i
myself
will
tell
him
of
my
meeting
with
sir
john
manners
rather
than
allow
you
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
he
will
be
angry
but
he
will
pity
me
for
god
sake
dorothy
do
not
tell
your
father
of
your
meetings
at
overhaddon
he
would
kill
you
have
you
lived
in
the
same
house
with
him
all
these
years
and
do
you
not
better
know
his
character
than
to
think
that
you
may
go
to
him
with
the
tale
you
have
just
told
me
and
that
he
will
forgive
you
feel
as
you
will
toward
me
but
believe
me
when
i
swear
to
you
by
my
knighthood
that
i
will
betray
to
no
person
what
you
have
this
day
divulged
to
me
dorothy
made
no
reply
but
turned
from
me
and
rapidly
walked
toward
the
hall
i
followed
at
a
short
distance
and
all
my
anger
was
displaced
by
fear
for
her
when
we
reached
the
hall
she
quickly
sought
her
father
and
approached
him
in
her
old
free
manner
full
of
confidence
in
her
influence
over
him
father
this
man
waving
her
hand
toward
me
has
come
to
haddon
hall
he
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
and
says
you
wish
me
to
accept
him
yes
doll
i
certainly
wish
it
with
all
my
heart
returned
sir
george
affectionately
taking
his
daughter
hand
then
you
need
wish
it
no
longer
for
i
will
not
marry
him
what
demanded
her
father
springing
to
his
feet
i
will
not
i
will
not
i
will
not
you
will
if
i
command
you
to
do
so
you
damned
insolent
wench
answered
sir
george
hoarsely
dorothy
eyes
opened
in
wonder
do
not
deceive
yourself
father
for
one
moment
she
retorted
contemptuously
he
has
come
here
in
sheep
clothing
and
has
adroitly
laid
his
plans
to
convince
you
that
i
should
marry
him
but
he
has
done
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
sir
george
growing
more
angry
every
moment
but
endeavoring
to
be
calm
nothing
of
the
sort
many
years
ago
i
spoke
to
him
on
this
subject
which
is
very
dear
to
my
heart
the
project
has
been
dear
to
me
ever
since
you
were
a
child
when
i
again
broached
it
to
malcolm
a
fortnight
or
more
since
i
feared
from
his
manner
that
he
was
averse
to
the
scheme
i
had
tried
several
times
to
speak
to
him
about
it
but
he
warded
me
off
and
when
i
did
speak
i
feared
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
it
yes
interrupted
the
headstrong
girl
apparently
bent
upon
destroying
both
of
us
he
pretended
that
he
did
not
wish
to
marry
me
he
said
he
wished
me
to
give
a
sham
consent
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
time
till
we
might
hit
upon
some
plan
by
which
we
could
change
your
mind
he
said
he
had
no
desire
nor
intention
to
marry
me
it
was
but
a
poor
lame
ruse
on
his
part
during
dorothy
recital
sir
george
turned
his
face
from
her
to
me
when
she
had
finished
speaking
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
said
does
my
daughter
speak
the
truth
did
you
say
yes
i
promptly
replied
i
have
no
intention
of
marrying
your
daughter
then
hoping
to
place
myself
before
sir
george
in
a
better
light
i
continued
i
could
not
accept
the
hand
of
a
lady
against
her
will
i
told
you
as
much
when
we
conversed
on
the
subject
what
exclaimed
sir
george
furious
with
anger
you
too
you
whom
i
have
befriended
i
told
you
sir
george
i
would
not
marry
dorothy
without
her
free
consent
no
gentleman
of
honor
would
accept
the
enforced
compliance
of
a
woman
but
doll
says
that
you
told
her
you
had
no
intention
of
marrying
her
even
should
she
consent
replied
sir
george
i
do
know
that
i
spoke
those
exact
words
i
replied
but
you
may
consider
them
said
you
damned
ungrateful
treacherous
hound
stormed
sir
george
you
listened
to
me
when
i
offered
you
my
daughter
hand
and
you
pretended
to
consent
without
at
the
time
having
any
intention
of
doing
so
that
i
suppose
is
true
sir
george
said
i
making
a
masterful
effort
against
anger
that
is
true
for
i
knew
that
dorothy
would
not
consent
and
had
i
been
inclined
to
the
marriage
i
repeat
i
would
marry
no
woman
against
her
will
no
gentleman
would
do
it
my
remark
threw
sir
george
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
i
did
it
you
cur
you
dog
you
you
traitorous
ungrateful
i
did
it
then
sir
george
said
i
interrupting
him
for
i
was
no
longer
able
to
restrain
my
anger
you
were
a
cowardly
poltroon
this
to
me
in
my
house
he
cried
grasping
a
chair
with
which
to
strike
me
dorothy
came
between
us
yes
said
i
and
as
much
more
as
you
wish
to
hear
i
stood
my
ground
and
sir
george
put
down
the
chair
leave
my
house
at
once
he
said
in
a
whisper
of
rage
if
you
are
on
my
premises
in
one
hour
from
now
i
will
have
you
flogged
from
my
door
by
the
butcher
what
have
i
done
cried
dorothy
what
have
i
done
your
regrets
come
late
mistress
vernon
said
i
she
shall
have
more
to
regret
said
sir
george
sullenly
go
to
your
room
you
brazen
disobedient
huzzy
and
if
you
leave
it
without
my
permission
by
god
i
will
have
you
whipped
till
you
bleed
i
will
teach
you
to
say
wo
when
i
say
shall
god
curse
my
soul
if
i
make
you
repent
this
day
as
i
left
the
room
dorothy
was
in
tears
and
sir
george
was
walking
the
floor
in
a
towering
rage
the
girl
had
learned
that
i
was
right
in
what
i
had
told
her
concerning
her
father
violent
temper
i
went
at
once
to
my
room
in
eagle
tower
and
collected
my
few
belongings
in
a
bundle
pitifully
small
it
was
i
tell
you
where
i
should
go
i
knew
not
and
where
i
should
remain
i
knew
even
less
for
my
purse
held
only
a
few
shillings
the
remnant
of
the
money
queen
mary
had
sent
to
me
by
the
hand
of
sir
thomas
douglas
england
was
as
unsafe
for
me
as
scotland
but
how
i
might
travel
to
france
without
money
and
how
i
might
without
a
pass
evade
elizabeth
officers
who
guarded
every
english
port
even
were
i
supplied
with
gold
were
problems
for
which
i
had
no
solution
there
were
but
two
persons
in
haddon
hall
to
whom
i
cared
to
say
farewell
they
were
lady
madge
and
will
dawson
the
latter
was
a
scot
and
was
attached
to
the
cause
of
queen
mary
he
and
i
had
become
friends
and
on
several
occasions
we
had
talked
confidentially
over
mary
sad
plight
when
my
bundle
was
packed
i
sought
madge
and
found
her
in
the
gallery
near
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
she
knew
my
step
and
rose
to
greet
me
with
a
bright
smile
i
have
come
to
say
to
you
cousin
madge
said
i
the
smile
vanished
from
her
face
you
are
not
going
to
leave
haddon
hall
she
asked
yes
and
forever
i
responded
sir
george
has
ordered
me
to
go
no
no
she
exclaimed
i
can
not
believe
it
i
supposed
that
you
and
my
uncle
were
friends
what
has
happened
tell
me
if
you
can
if
you
wish
let
me
touch
your
hand
and
as
she
held
out
her
hands
i
gladly
grasped
them
i
have
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
than
madge
stanley
hands
they
were
not
small
but
their
shape
from
the
fair
round
forearm
and
wrist
to
the
ends
of
the
fingers
was
worthy
of
a
sculptor
dream
beyond
their
physical
beauty
there
was
an
expression
in
them
which
would
have
belonged
to
her
eyes
had
she
possessed
the
sense
of
sight
the
flood
of
her
vital
energy
had
for
so
many
years
been
directed
toward
her
hands
as
a
substitute
for
her
lost
eyesight
that
their
sensitiveness
showed
itself
not
only
in
an
infinite
variety
of
delicate
gestures
and
movements
changing
with
her
changing
moods
but
they
had
an
expression
of
their
own
such
as
we
look
for
in
the
eyes
i
had
gazed
upon
her
hands
so
often
and
had
studied
so
carefully
their
varying
expression
discernible
both
to
my
sight
and
to
my
touch
that
i
could
read
her
mind
through
them
as
we
read
the
emotions
of
others
through
the
countenance
the
feel
of
her
hands
if
i
may
use
the
word
i
can
in
no
way
describe
its
effect
on
me
was
magical
the
happiest
moments
i
have
ever
known
were
those
when
i
held
the
fair
blind
girl
by
the
hand
and
strolled
upon
the
great
terrace
or
followed
the
babbling
winding
course
of
dear
old
wye
and
drank
in
the
elixir
of
all
that
is
good
and
pure
from
the
cup
of
her
sweet
unconscious
influence
madge
too
had
found
happiness
in
our
strolling
she
had
also
found
health
and
strength
and
marvellous
to
say
there
had
come
to
her
a
slight
improvement
in
vision
she
had
always
been
able
to
distinguish
sunlight
from
darkness
but
with
renewed
strength
had
come
the
power
dimly
to
discern
dark
objects
in
a
strong
light
and
even
that
small
change
for
the
better
had
brought
unspeakable
gladness
to
her
heart
she
said
she
owed
it
all
to
me
a
faint
pink
had
spread
itself
in
her
cheeks
and
a
plumpness
had
been
imparted
to
her
form
which
gave
to
her
ethereal
beauty
a
touch
of
the
material
nor
was
this
to
be
regretted
for
no
man
can
adequately
make
love
to
a
woman
who
has
too
much
of
the
angel
in
her
you
must
not
think
however
that
i
had
been
making
love
to
madge
on
the
contrary
i
again
say
the
thought
had
never
entered
my
mind
neither
at
that
time
had
i
even
suspected
that
she
would
listen
to
me
upon
the
great
theme
i
had
in
my
assigned
many
reasons
other
than
love
for
my
tenderness
toward
her
but
when
i
was
about
to
depart
and
she
impulsively
gave
me
her
hands
i
believing
that
i
was
grasping
them
for
the
last
time
felt
the
conviction
come
upon
me
that
she
was
dearer
to
me
than
all
else
in
life
do
you
want
to
tell
me
why
my
uncle
has
driven
you
from
haddon
she
asked
he
wished
me
to
ask
dorothy
to
be
my
wife
i
returned
and
you
she
queried
i
did
so
instantly
the
girl
withdrew
her
hands
from
mine
and
stepped
back
from
me
then
i
had
another
revelation
i
knew
what
she
meant
and
felt
her
hands
told
me
all
even
had
there
been
no
expression
in
her
movement
and
in
her
face
dorothy
refused
i
continued
and
her
father
desired
to
force
her
into
compliance
i
would
not
be
a
party
to
the
transaction
and
sir
george
ordered
me
to
leave
his
house
after
a
moment
of
painful
silence
madge
said
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
should
wish
to
marry
dorothy
she
she
must
be
very
beautiful
i
do
not
wish
to
marry
dorothy
said
i
heard
a
slight
noise
back
of
me
but
gave
it
no
heed
and
i
should
not
have
married
her
had
she
consented
i
knew
that
dorothy
would
refuse
me
therefore
i
promised
sir
george
that
i
would
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
sir
george
had
always
been
my
friend
and
should
i
refuse
to
comply
with
his
wishes
i
well
knew
he
would
be
my
enemy
he
is
bitterly
angry
against
me
now
but
when
he
becomes
calm
he
will
see
wherein
he
has
wronged
me
i
asked
dorothy
to
help
me
but
she
would
not
listen
to
my
plan
and
now
she
begs
your
forgiveness
cried
dorothy
as
she
ran
weeping
to
me
and
took
my
hand
most
humbly
dorothy
dorothy
i
exclaimed
what
frightful
evil
have
i
brought
upon
you
said
she
where
can
you
go
what
will
you
do
i
know
not
i
answered
i
shall
probably
go
to
the
tower
of
london
when
queen
elizabeth
officers
learn
of
my
quarrel
with
sir
george
but
i
will
try
to
escape
to
france
have
you
money
asked
madge
tightly
holding
one
of
my
hands
a
small
sum
i
answered
how
much
have
you
tell
me
tell
me
how
much
have
you
insisted
madge
clinging
to
my
hand
and
speaking
with
a
force
that
would
brook
no
refusal
a
very
little
sum
i
am
sorry
to
say
only
a
few
shillings
i
responded
she
quickly
withdrew
her
hand
from
mine
and
began
to
remove
the
baubles
from
her
ears
and
the
brooch
from
her
throat
then
she
nervously
stripped
the
rings
from
her
fingers
and
held
out
the
little
handful
of
jewels
toward
me
groping
for
my
hands
take
these
malcolm
take
these
and
wait
here
till
i
return
she
turned
toward
the
staircase
but
in
her
confusion
she
missed
it
and
before
i
could
reach
her
she
struck
against
the
great
newel
post
god
pity
me
she
said
as
i
took
her
hand
i
wish
i
were
dead
please
lead
me
to
the
staircase
cousin
malcolm
thank
you
she
was
weeping
gently
when
she
started
up
the
steps
and
i
knew
that
she
was
going
to
fetch
me
her
little
treasure
of
gold
madge
held
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
with
one
hand
while
she
grasped
the
banister
with
the
other
she
was
halfway
up
when
dorothy
whose
generous
impulses
needed
only
to
be
prompted
ran
nimbly
and
was
about
to
pass
her
on
the
staircase
when
madge
grasped
her
gown
please
do
dorothy
please
do
not
i
beg
you
do
not
forestall
me
let
me
do
this
let
me
you
have
all
else
to
make
you
happy
do
take
this
from
me
only
because
you
can
see
and
can
walk
faster
than
i
dorothy
did
not
stop
but
hurried
past
her
madge
sank
upon
the
steps
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
she
came
gropingly
back
to
me
just
as
dorothy
returned
take
these
cousin
malcolm
cried
dorothy
here
are
a
few
stones
of
great
value
they
belonged
to
my
mother
madge
was
sitting
dejectedly
upon
the
lowest
step
of
the
staircase
dorothy
held
her
toward
me
and
in
the
midst
of
the
diamonds
and
gold
i
saw
the
heart
john
manners
had
given
her
i
did
not
take
the
box
do
you
offer
me
this
too
even
this
i
said
lifting
the
heart
from
the
box
by
its
yes
yes
cried
dorothy
even
that
gladly
gladly
i
replaced
it
in
the
box
then
spoke
madge
while
she
tried
to
check
the
falling
tears
dorothy
you
are
a
cruel
selfish
girl
oh
madge
cried
dorothy
stepping
to
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
how
can
you
speak
so
unkindly
to
me
you
have
everything
good
interrupted
madge
you
have
beauty
wealth
eyesight
and
yet
you
would
not
leave
to
me
the
joy
of
helping
him
i
could
not
see
and
you
hurried
past
me
that
you
might
be
first
to
give
him
the
help
of
which
i
was
the
first
to
think
dorothy
was
surprised
at
the
outburst
from
madge
and
kneeled
by
her
side
we
may
both
help
cousin
malcolm
she
said
no
no
responded
madge
angrily
your
jewels
are
more
than
enough
he
would
have
no
need
of
my
poor
offering
i
took
madge
hand
and
said
i
shall
accept
help
from
no
one
but
you
madge
from
no
one
but
you
i
will
go
to
our
rooms
for
your
box
said
dorothy
who
had
begun
to
see
the
trouble
i
will
fetch
it
for
you
no
i
will
fetch
it
answered
madge
she
arose
and
i
led
her
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
when
she
returned
she
held
in
her
hands
a
purse
and
a
little
box
of
jewels
these
she
offered
to
me
but
i
took
only
the
purse
saying
i
accept
the
purse
it
contains
more
money
than
i
shall
need
from
its
weight
i
should
say
there
are
twenty
gold
pounds
sterling
answered
madge
i
have
saved
them
believing
that
the
time
might
come
when
they
would
be
of
great
use
to
me
i
did
not
know
the
joy
i
was
saving
for
myself
tears
came
to
my
eyes
and
dorothy
wept
silently
will
you
not
take
the
jewels
also
asked
madge
no
i
responded
the
purse
will
more
than
pay
my
expenses
to
france
where
i
have
wealthy
relatives
there
i
may
have
my
mother
estate
for
the
asking
and
i
can
repay
you
the
gold
i
can
never
repay
your
kindness
i
hope
you
will
never
offer
to
repay
the
gold
said
madge
i
will
not
i
gladly
answered
as
to
the
kindness
she
said
you
have
paid
me
in
advance
for
that
many
many
times
over
i
then
said
farewell
promising
to
send
letters
telling
of
my
fortune
as
i
was
leaving
i
bent
forward
and
kissed
madge
upon
the
forehead
while
she
gently
pressed
my
hand
but
did
not
speak
a
word
cousin
malcolm
said
dorothy
who
held
my
other
hand
you
are
a
strong
gentle
noble
man
and
i
want
you
to
say
that
you
forgive
me
i
do
forgive
you
dorothy
from
my
heart
i
could
not
blame
you
if
i
wished
to
do
so
for
you
did
not
know
what
you
were
doing
not
to
know
is
sometimes
the
greatest
of
sins
answered
dorothy
i
bent
forward
to
kiss
her
cheek
in
token
of
my
full
forgiveness
but
she
gave
me
her
lips
and
said
i
shall
never
again
be
guilty
of
not
knowing
that
you
are
good
and
true
and
noble
cousin
malcolm
and
i
shall
never
again
doubt
your
wisdom
or
your
good
faith
when
you
speak
to
me
she
did
doubt
me
afterward
but
i
fear
her
doubt
was
with
good
cause
i
shall
tell
you
of
it
in
the
proper
place
then
i
forced
myself
to
leave
my
fair
friends
and
went
to
the
gateway
under
eagle
tower
where
i
found
will
dawson
waiting
for
me
with
my
horse
sir
george
ordered
me
to
bring
your
horse
said
will
he
seemed
much
excited
has
anything
disagreeable
happened
are
you
leaving
us
i
see
you
wear
your
steel
cap
and
breastplate
and
are
carrying
your
bundle
yes
will
your
master
has
quarrelled
with
me
and
i
must
leave
his
house
but
where
do
you
go
sir
malcolm
you
remember
that
of
which
we
talked
in
england
no
place
but
haddon
hall
will
be
safe
for
you
and
the
ports
are
so
closely
guarded
that
you
will
certainly
be
arrested
if
you
try
to
sail
for
france
i
know
all
that
only
too
well
will
but
i
must
go
and
i
will
try
to
escape
to
france
if
you
wish
to
communicate
with
me
i
may
be
found
by
addressing
a
letter
in
care
of
the
duc
de
guise
if
i
can
ever
be
of
help
to
you
said
will
personally
or
in
that
other
matter
queen
mary
you
understand
you
have
only
to
call
on
me
i
thank
you
will
i
returned
i
shall
probably
accept
your
kind
offer
sooner
than
you
anticipate
do
you
know
jennie
faxton
the
daughter
i
do
he
responded
i
believe
she
may
be
trusted
i
said
indeed
i
believe
she
is
true
as
any
steel
in
her
father
shop
will
responded
will
you
may
hear
from
me
soon
i
mounted
and
rode
back
of
the
terrace
taking
my
way
along
the
wye
toward
rowsley
when
i
turned
and
looked
back
i
saw
dorothy
standing
upon
the
terrace
by
her
side
dressed
in
white
stood
madge
her
hand
was
covering
her
eyes
a
step
or
two
below
them
on
the
terrace
staircase
stood
will
dawson
they
were
three
stanch
friends
although
one
of
them
had
brought
my
troubles
upon
me
after
all
i
was
leaving
haddon
hall
well
garrisoned
my
heart
also
was
well
garrisoned
with
a
faithful
troop
of
pain
but
i
shall
write
no
more
of
that
time
it
was
too
full
of
bitterness
chapter
v
mine
enemy
i
rode
down
the
wye
to
rowsley
and
by
the
will
of
my
horse
rather
than
by
any
intention
of
my
own
took
the
road
up
through
lathkil
dale
i
had
determined
if
possible
to
reach
the
city
of
chester
and
thence
to
ride
down
into
wales
hoping
to
find
on
the
rough
welsh
coast
a
fishing
boat
or
a
smuggler
craft
that
would
carry
me
to
france
in
truth
i
cared
little
whether
i
went
to
the
tower
or
to
france
since
in
either
case
i
felt
that
i
had
looked
my
last
upon
haddon
hall
and
had
spoken
farewell
to
the
only
person
in
all
the
world
for
whom
i
really
cared
my
ride
from
haddon
gave
me
time
for
deliberate
thought
and
i
fully
agreed
with
myself
upon
two
propositions
first
i
became
thoroughly
conscious
of
my
real
feeling
toward
madge
and
secondly
i
was
convinced
that
her
kindness
and
her
peculiar
attitude
toward
me
when
i
parted
from
her
were
but
the
promptings
of
a
tender
heart
stirred
by
pity
for
my
unfortunate
situation
rather
than
what
i
thought
when
i
said
farewell
to
her
the
sweet
wye
and
the
beautiful
lathkil
whispered
to
me
as
i
rode
beside
their
banks
but
in
their
murmurings
i
heard
only
the
music
of
her
voice
the
sun
shone
brightly
but
its
blessed
light
only
served
to
remind
me
of
the
beautiful
girl
whom
i
had
left
in
darkness
the
light
were
worthless
to
me
if
i
could
not
share
it
with
her
what
a
mooning
lout
was
i
all
my
life
i
had
been
a
philosopher
and
as
i
rode
from
haddon
beneath
all
my
gloominess
there
ran
a
current
of
amusement
which
brought
to
my
lips
an
laugh
when
i
thought
of
the
plight
and
condition
in
which
i
by
candid
found
myself
five
years
before
that
time
i
had
left
france
and
had
cast
behind
me
all
the
fair
possibilities
for
noble
achievement
which
were
offered
to
me
in
that
land
that
i
might
follow
the
fortunes
of
a
woman
whom
i
thought
i
loved
before
my
exile
from
her
side
i
had
begun
to
fear
that
my
idol
was
but
a
thing
of
stone
and
now
that
i
had
learned
to
know
myself
and
to
see
her
as
she
really
was
i
realized
that
i
had
been
worshipping
naught
but
clay
for
lo
these
many
years
there
was
only
this
consolation
in
the
thought
for
me
every
man
at
some
time
in
his
life
is
a
fool
made
such
by
a
woman
it
is
given
to
but
few
men
to
have
for
their
the
rightful
queen
of
three
kingdoms
all
that
was
left
to
me
of
my
life
of
devotion
was
a
pride
in
the
quality
of
my
then
thought
i
i
have
at
last
turned
to
be
my
own
but
i
suppose
it
had
been
written
in
the
book
of
fate
that
i
should
ride
from
haddon
a
lovelorn
youth
of
and
i
certainly
was
fulfilling
my
destiny
to
the
letter
i
continued
to
ride
up
the
lathkil
until
i
came
to
a
fork
in
the
road
one
branch
led
to
the
northwest
the
other
toward
the
southwest
i
was
at
a
loss
which
direction
to
take
and
i
left
the
choice
to
my
horse
in
whose
wisdom
and
judgement
i
had
more
confidence
than
in
my
own
my
horse
refusing
the
responsibility
stopped
so
there
we
stood
like
an
equestrian
statue
arguing
with
itself
until
i
saw
a
horseman
riding
toward
me
from
the
direction
of
overhaddon
when
he
approached
i
recognized
sir
john
manners
he
looked
as
woebegone
as
i
felt
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
pair
of
us
for
i
knew
that
his
trouble
was
akin
to
mine
the
pain
of
love
is
ludicrous
to
all
save
those
who
feel
it
even
to
them
it
is
laughable
in
others
a
heart
has
no
room
for
that
sort
of
charity
which
pities
for
kinship
sake
what
is
the
trouble
with
you
sir
john
that
you
look
so
downcast
said
i
offering
my
hand
ah
he
answered
forcing
a
poor
look
of
cheerfulness
into
his
face
sir
malcolm
i
am
glad
to
see
you
do
i
look
downcast
as
forlorn
as
a
lover
who
has
missed
seeing
his
sweetheart
i
responded
guessing
the
cause
of
sir
john
despondency
i
have
no
sweetheart
therefore
missing
her
could
not
have
made
me
downcast
he
replied
so
you
really
did
miss
her
i
queried
she
was
detained
at
haddon
hall
sir
john
to
bid
me
farewell
i
do
not
understand
began
sir
john
growing
cold
in
his
bearing
i
understand
quite
well
i
answered
dorothy
told
me
all
you
need
keep
nothing
from
me
the
golden
heart
brought
her
into
trouble
and
made
mischief
for
me
of
which
i
can
not
see
the
end
i
will
tell
you
the
story
while
we
ride
i
am
seeking
my
way
to
chester
that
i
may
if
possible
sail
for
france
this
fork
in
the
road
has
brought
me
to
a
standstill
and
my
horse
refuses
to
decide
which
route
we
shall
take
perhaps
you
will
direct
us
gladly
the
road
to
the
southwest
the
one
i
shall
take
is
the
most
direct
route
to
chester
but
tell
me
how
comes
it
that
you
are
leaving
haddon
hall
i
thought
you
had
gone
there
to
he
stopped
speaking
and
a
smile
stole
into
his
eyes
let
us
ride
forward
together
and
i
will
tell
you
about
it
said
i
while
we
travelled
i
told
sir
john
the
circumstances
of
my
departure
from
haddon
hall
concealing
nothing
save
that
which
touched
madge
stanley
i
then
spoke
of
my
dangerous
position
in
england
and
told
him
of
my
great
desire
to
reach
my
mother
people
in
france
you
will
find
difficulty
and
danger
in
escaping
to
france
at
this
time
said
sir
john
the
guard
at
the
ports
is
very
strong
and
strict
and
your
greatest
risk
will
be
at
the
moment
when
you
try
to
embark
without
a
passport
that
is
true
i
responded
but
i
know
of
nothing
else
that
i
can
do
come
with
me
to
rutland
castle
said
sir
john
you
may
there
find
refuge
until
such
time
as
you
can
go
to
france
i
will
gladly
furnish
you
money
which
you
may
repay
at
your
pleasure
and
i
may
soon
be
able
to
procure
a
passport
for
you
i
thanked
him
but
said
i
did
not
see
my
way
clear
to
accept
his
kind
offer
you
are
unknown
in
the
neighborhood
of
rutland
he
continued
and
you
may
easily
remain
incognito
although
his
offer
was
greatly
to
my
liking
i
suggested
several
objections
chief
among
which
was
the
distaste
lord
rutland
might
feel
toward
one
of
my
name
i
would
not
of
course
consent
that
my
identity
should
be
concealed
from
him
but
to
be
brief
an
almost
impossible
achievement
for
me
it
seems
sir
john
assured
me
of
his
father
welcome
and
it
was
arranged
between
us
that
i
should
take
my
baptismal
name
françois
de
lorraine
and
passing
for
a
french
gentleman
on
a
visit
to
england
should
go
to
rutland
with
my
friend
so
it
happened
through
the
strange
workings
of
fate
that
i
found
help
and
refuge
under
my
enemy
kind
old
lord
rutland
welcomed
me
as
his
son
had
foretold
and
i
was
convinced
ere
i
had
passed
an
hour
under
his
roof
that
the
feud
between
him
and
sir
george
was
of
the
latter
brewing
the
happenings
in
haddon
hall
while
i
lived
at
rutland
i
knew
of
course
only
by
the
mouth
of
others
but
for
convenience
in
telling
i
shall
speak
of
them
as
if
i
had
seen
and
heard
all
that
took
place
i
may
now
say
once
for
all
that
i
shall
take
that
liberty
throughout
this
entire
history
on
the
morning
of
the
day
after
my
departure
from
haddon
jennie
faxton
went
to
visit
dorothy
and
gave
her
a
piece
of
information
small
in
itself
but
large
in
its
effect
upon
that
ardent
young
lady
will
fletcher
the
at
overhaddon
had
observed
dorothy
movements
in
connection
with
manners
and
although
fletcher
did
not
know
who
sir
john
was
that
fact
added
to
his
curiosity
and
righteous
indignation
it
do
be
right
that
some
one
should
tell
the
king
of
the
peak
as
how
his
daughter
is
carrying
on
with
a
young
man
who
does
come
here
every
day
or
two
to
meet
her
and
i
do
intend
to
tell
sir
george
if
she
put
not
a
stop
to
it
said
fletcher
to
some
of
his
gossips
in
yulegrave
churchyard
one
sunday
afternoon
dorothy
notified
john
jennie
being
the
messenger
of
will
observations
visual
and
verbal
and
designated
another
place
for
meeting
the
gate
east
of
bowling
green
hill
this
gate
was
part
of
a
wall
on
the
east
side
of
the
haddon
estates
adjoining
the
lands
of
the
house
of
devonshire
which
lay
to
the
eastward
it
was
a
secluded
spot
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
half
a
mile
distant
from
haddon
hall
sir
george
for
a
fortnight
or
more
after
my
disappearance
enforced
his
decree
of
imprisonment
against
dorothy
and
she
being
unable
to
leave
the
hall
could
not
go
to
bowling
green
gate
to
meet
sir
john
before
i
had
learned
of
the
new
john
had
ridden
thither
several
evenings
to
meet
dorothy
but
had
found
only
jennie
bearing
her
mistress
excuses
i
supposed
his
journeyings
had
been
to
overhaddon
but
i
did
not
press
his
confidence
nor
did
he
give
it
sir
george
treatment
of
dorothy
had
taught
her
that
the
citadel
of
her
father
wrath
could
be
stormed
only
by
gentleness
and
an
opportunity
was
soon
presented
in
which
she
used
that
effective
engine
of
feminine
warfare
to
her
great
advantage
as
i
have
told
you
sir
george
was
very
rich
no
man
either
noble
or
gentle
in
derbyshire
or
in
any
of
the
adjoining
counties
possessed
so
great
an
estate
or
so
beautiful
a
hall
as
did
he
in
france
we
would
have
called
haddon
hall
a
grand
château
sir
george
deceased
wife
had
been
a
sister
to
the
earl
of
derby
who
lived
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
writing
the
earl
had
a
son
james
who
was
heir
to
the
title
and
to
the
estates
of
his
father
the
son
was
a
dissipated
rustic
clown
almost
a
simpleton
he
had
the
vulgarity
of
a
stable
boy
and
the
vices
of
a
courtier
his
associates
were
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
gamesters
ruffians
and
tavern
maids
still
he
was
a
scion
of
one
of
the
greatest
families
of
england
nobility
after
sir
george
trouble
with
dorothy
growing
out
of
his
desire
that
i
should
wed
her
the
king
of
the
peak
had
begun
to
feel
that
in
his
beautiful
daughter
he
had
upon
his
hands
a
commodity
that
might
at
any
time
cause
him
trouble
he
therefore
determined
to
marry
her
to
some
eligible
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
place
the
heavy
responsibility
of
managing
her
in
the
hands
of
a
husband
the
stubborn
violence
of
sir
george
nature
the
rough
side
of
which
had
never
before
been
shown
to
dorothy
in
her
became
adroit
wilfulness
of
a
quality
that
no
masculine
mind
may
compass
but
her
life
had
been
so
entirely
undisturbed
by
opposing
influences
that
her
father
firm
in
the
belief
that
no
one
in
his
household
would
dare
to
thwart
his
will
had
remained
in
dangerous
ignorance
of
the
latent
trouble
which
pervaded
his
daughter
from
the
soles
of
her
shapely
feet
to
the
top
of
her
head
sir
george
in
casting
about
for
a
had
hit
upon
the
heir
to
the
house
of
derby
as
a
suitable
match
for
his
child
and
had
entered
into
an
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
the
earl
against
the
common
enemy
dorothy
the
two
fathers
had
partly
agreed
that
the
heir
to
derby
should
wed
the
heiress
of
haddon
the
heir
although
he
had
never
seen
his
cousin
except
when
she
was
a
plain
unattractive
girl
was
entirely
willing
for
the
match
but
the
heiress
well
she
had
not
been
consulted
and
everybody
connected
with
the
affair
instinctively
knew
there
would
be
trouble
in
that
quarter
sir
george
however
had
determined
that
dorothy
should
do
her
part
in
case
the
contract
of
marriage
should
be
agreed
upon
between
the
heads
of
the
houses
he
had
fully
resolved
to
assert
the
majesty
of
the
law
vested
in
him
as
a
father
and
to
compel
dorothy
to
do
his
bidding
if
there
were
efficacy
in
force
and
chastisement
at
the
time
when
sir
george
spoke
to
dorothy
about
the
derby
marriage
she
had
been
a
prisoner
for
a
fortnight
or
more
and
had
learned
that
her
only
hope
against
her
father
lay
in
cunning
so
she
wept
and
begged
for
time
in
which
to
consider
the
answer
she
would
give
to
lord
derby
request
she
begged
for
two
months
or
even
one
month
in
which
to
bring
herself
to
accede
to
her
father
commands
you
have
always
been
so
kind
and
good
to
me
father
that
i
shall
try
to
obey
if
you
and
the
earl
eventually
agree
upon
terms
she
said
tearfully
having
no
intention
whatever
of
trying
to
do
anything
but
disobey
try
stormed
sir
george
try
to
obey
me
by
god
girl
i
say
you
shall
obey
oh
father
i
am
so
young
i
have
not
seen
my
cousin
for
years
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
and
i
have
never
thought
twice
of
any
man
do
not
drive
me
from
you
sir
george
eager
to
crush
in
the
outset
any
disposition
to
oppose
his
will
grew
violent
and
threatened
his
daughter
with
dire
punishment
if
she
were
not
docile
and
obedient
then
said
rare
dorothy
it
would
indeed
be
a
great
match
greater
than
ever
will
happen
she
thought
i
should
be
a
countess
she
strutted
across
the
room
with
head
up
and
with
dilating
nostrils
the
truth
was
she
desired
to
gain
her
liberty
once
more
that
she
might
go
to
john
and
was
ready
to
promise
anything
to
achieve
that
end
what
sort
of
a
countess
would
i
make
father
a
glorious
countess
doll
a
glorious
countess
said
her
father
laughing
you
are
a
good
girl
to
obey
me
so
readily
oh
but
i
have
not
obeyed
you
yet
returned
dorothy
fearing
that
her
father
might
be
suspicious
of
a
too
ready
acquiescence
but
you
will
obey
me
answered
sir
george
half
in
command
and
half
in
entreaty
there
are
not
many
girls
who
would
refuse
the
coronet
of
a
countess
she
then
seated
herself
upon
her
father
knee
and
kissed
him
while
sir
george
laughed
softly
over
his
easy
victory
blessed
is
the
man
who
does
not
know
when
he
is
beaten
seeing
her
father
kindly
humor
dorothy
said
father
do
you
still
wish
me
to
remain
a
prisoner
in
my
rooms
if
you
promise
to
be
a
good
obedient
daughter
returned
sir
george
you
shall
have
your
liberty
i
have
always
been
that
father
and
i
am
too
old
to
learn
otherwise
answered
this
girl
whose
father
had
taught
her
deception
by
his
violence
you
may
drive
men
but
you
can
not
drive
any
woman
who
is
worth
possessing
you
may
for
a
time
think
you
drive
her
but
in
the
end
she
will
have
her
way
dorothy
first
act
of
obedience
after
regaining
liberty
was
to
send
a
letter
to
manners
by
the
hand
of
jennie
faxton
john
received
the
letter
in
the
evening
and
all
next
day
he
passed
the
time
whistling
singing
and
looking
now
and
again
at
his
horologue
he
walked
about
the
castle
like
a
happy
wolf
in
a
pen
he
did
not
tell
me
there
was
a
project
on
foot
with
dorothy
as
the
objective
but
i
knew
it
and
waited
with
some
impatience
for
the
outcome
long
before
the
appointed
time
which
was
sunset
john
galloped
forth
for
bowling
green
gate
with
joy
and
anticipation
in
his
heart
and
pain
in
his
conscience
as
he
rode
he
resolved
again
and
again
that
the
interview
toward
which
he
was
hastening
should
be
the
last
he
would
have
with
dorothy
but
when
he
pictured
the
girl
to
himself
and
thought
upon
her
marvellous
beauty
and
infinite
winsomeness
his
conscience
was
drowned
in
his
longing
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
postpone
resolving
until
the
morrow
john
hitched
his
horse
near
the
gate
and
stood
looking
between
the
massive
iron
bars
toward
haddon
hall
whose
turrets
could
be
seen
through
the
leafless
boughs
of
the
trees
the
sun
was
sinking
perilously
low
thought
john
and
with
each
moment
his
heart
also
sank
while
his
good
resolutions
showed
the
flimsy
fibre
of
their
fabric
and
were
rent
asunder
by
the
fear
that
she
might
not
come
as
the
moments
dragged
on
and
she
did
not
come
a
hundred
alarms
tormented
him
first
among
these
was
a
dread
that
she
might
have
made
resolves
such
as
had
sprung
up
so
plenteously
in
him
and
that
she
might
have
been
strong
enough
to
act
upon
them
and
to
remain
at
home
but
he
was
mistaken
in
the
girl
such
resolutions
as
he
had
been
making
and
breaking
had
never
come
to
her
at
all
the
difference
between
the
man
and
the
woman
was
this
he
resolved
in
his
mind
not
to
see
her
and
failed
in
keeping
to
his
resolution
while
she
resolved
in
her
heart
to
see
him
resolved
that
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
or
the
other
place
could
keep
her
from
seeing
him
and
succeeded
in
carrying
out
her
resolution
the
intuitive
resolve
the
one
that
does
not
know
it
is
a
resolution
is
the
sort
before
which
obstacles
fall
like
corn
before
the
sickle
after
john
had
waited
a
weary
time
the
form
of
the
girl
appeared
above
the
crest
of
the
hill
she
was
holding
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
and
glided
over
the
earth
so
rapidly
that
she
appeared
to
be
running
beat
beat
oh
heart
of
john
if
there
is
aught
in
womanhood
to
make
you
throb
if
there
is
aught
in
infinite
grace
and
winsomeness
if
there
is
aught
in
perfect
harmony
of
color
and
form
and
movement
if
there
is
aught
of
beauty
in
god
power
to
create
that
can
set
you
pulsing
beat
for
the
fairest
creature
of
his
hand
is
hastening
to
greet
you
the
wind
had
dishevelled
her
hair
and
it
was
blowing
in
fluffy
curls
of
golden
red
about
her
face
her
cheeks
were
slightly
flushed
with
joy
and
exercise
her
red
lips
were
parted
and
her
eyes
but
i
am
wasting
words
as
for
john
heart
it
almost
smothered
him
with
its
beating
he
had
never
before
supposed
that
he
could
experience
such
violent
throbbing
within
his
breast
and
live
but
at
last
she
was
at
the
gate
in
all
her
exquisite
beauty
and
winsomeness
and
something
must
be
done
to
make
the
heart
conform
to
the
usages
of
good
society
she
too
was
in
trouble
with
her
breathing
but
john
thought
that
her
trouble
was
owing
to
exertion
however
that
may
have
been
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
was
ever
so
beautiful
so
radiant
so
graceful
or
so
fair
as
this
girl
who
had
come
to
give
herself
to
john
it
seems
that
i
can
not
take
myself
away
from
the
attractive
theme
ah
sir
john
you
did
come
said
the
girl
joyously
yes
john
succeeded
in
replying
after
an
effort
and
you
i
thank
you
gracious
lady
for
coming
i
do
not
deserve
the
heart
again
asserted
itself
and
dorothy
stood
by
the
gate
with
downcast
eyes
waiting
to
learn
what
it
was
that
john
did
not
deserve
she
thought
he
deserved
everything
good
i
fear
i
have
caused
you
fatigue
said
john
again
thinking
and
with
good
reason
that
he
was
a
fool
the
english
language
which
he
had
always
supposed
to
be
his
mother
tongue
had
deserted
him
as
if
it
were
his
after
all
the
difficulty
as
john
subsequently
said
was
that
dorothy
beauty
had
deprived
him
of
the
power
to
think
he
could
only
see
he
was
entirely
disorganized
by
a
girl
whom
he
could
have
carried
away
in
his
arms
i
feel
no
fatigue
replied
dorothy
i
feared
that
in
climbing
the
hill
you
had
lost
your
breath
answered
disorganized
john
so
i
did
she
returned
then
she
gave
a
great
sigh
and
said
now
i
am
all
right
again
all
right
so
is
the
morning
sun
so
is
the
arching
rainbow
and
so
are
the
flitting
lights
of
the
north
in
midwinter
all
are
all
right
because
god
made
them
as
he
made
dorothy
perfect
each
after
its
kind
a
long
uneasy
pause
ensued
dorothy
felt
the
embarrassing
silence
less
than
john
and
could
have
helped
him
greatly
had
she
wished
to
do
so
but
she
had
made
the
advances
at
their
former
meetings
and
as
she
had
told
me
she
had
done
a
great
deal
more
than
her
part
in
going
to
meet
him
therefore
she
determined
that
he
should
do
his
own
wooing
thenceforward
she
had
graciously
given
him
all
the
opportunity
he
had
any
right
to
ask
while
journeying
to
bowling
green
gate
john
had
formulated
many
true
and
beautiful
sentiments
of
a
personal
nature
which
he
intended
expressing
to
dorothy
but
when
the
opportunity
came
for
him
to
speak
the
weather
his
horse
dorothy
mare
dolcy
the
queens
of
england
and
scotland
were
the
only
subjects
on
which
he
could
induce
his
tongue
to
perform
even
moderately
well
dorothy
listened
attentively
while
john
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gate
discoursed
limpingly
on
the
themes
and
although
in
former
interviews
she
had
found
those
topics
quite
interesting
upon
that
occasion
she
had
come
to
bowling
green
gate
to
listen
to
something
else
and
was
piqued
not
to
hear
it
after
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
she
said
demurely
i
may
not
remain
here
longer
i
shall
be
missed
at
the
hall
i
regained
my
liberty
but
yesterday
and
father
will
be
suspicious
of
me
during
the
next
few
days
i
must
be
watchful
and
must
have
a
care
of
my
behavior
john
summoned
his
wits
and
might
have
spoken
his
mind
freely
had
he
not
feared
to
say
too
much
despite
dorothy
witchery
honor
conscience
and
prudence
still
bore
weight
with
him
and
they
all
dictated
that
he
should
cling
to
the
shreds
of
his
resolution
and
not
allow
matters
to
go
too
far
between
him
and
this
fascinating
girl
he
was
much
in
love
with
her
but
dorothy
had
reached
at
a
bound
a
height
to
which
he
was
still
climbing
soon
john
also
was
to
reach
the
pinnacle
whence
honor
conscience
and
prudence
were
to
be
banished
i
fear
i
must
now
leave
you
said
dorothy
as
darkness
began
to
gather
i
hope
i
may
soon
see
you
again
said
john
sometime
i
will
see
you
if
if
i
can
she
answered
with
downcast
eyes
it
is
seldom
i
can
leave
the
hall
alone
but
i
shall
try
to
come
here
at
sunset
some
future
day
john
silence
upon
a
certain
theme
had
given
offence
i
can
not
tell
you
how
greatly
i
thank
you
cried
john
i
will
say
adieu
said
dorothy
as
she
offered
him
her
hand
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
john
raised
the
hand
gallantly
to
his
lips
and
when
she
had
withdrawn
it
there
seemed
no
reason
for
her
to
remain
but
she
stood
for
a
moment
hesitatingly
then
she
stooped
to
reach
into
her
pocket
while
she
daintily
lifted
the
skirt
of
her
gown
with
the
other
hand
and
from
the
pocket
drew
forth
a
great
iron
key
i
brought
this
key
thinking
that
you
might
wish
to
unlock
the
gate
and
come
to
to
this
side
i
had
great
difficulty
in
taking
it
from
the
forester
closet
where
it
has
been
hanging
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
she
showed
john
the
key
returned
it
to
her
pocket
made
a
courtesy
and
moved
slowly
away
walking
backward
mistress
vernon
cried
john
i
beg
you
to
let
me
have
the
key
it
is
too
late
now
said
the
girl
with
downcast
eyes
darkness
is
rapidly
falling
and
i
must
return
to
the
hall
john
began
to
climb
the
gate
but
she
stopped
him
he
had
thrown
away
his
opportunity
please
do
not
follow
me
sir
john
said
she
still
moving
backward
i
must
not
remain
longer
only
for
one
moment
pleaded
john
no
the
girl
responded
i
i
may
perhaps
bring
the
key
when
i
come
again
i
am
glad
sir
john
that
you
came
to
meet
me
this
evening
she
courtesied
and
then
hurried
away
toward
haddon
hall
twice
she
looked
backward
and
waved
her
hand
and
john
stood
watching
her
through
the
bars
till
her
form
was
lost
to
view
beneath
the
crest
of
bowling
green
hill
brought
this
key
thinking
that
you
might
wish
to
unlock
the
gate
and
come
to
this
side
muttered
john
quoting
the
girl
words
compared
with
you
john
manners
there
is
no
other
fool
in
this
world
then
meditatively
i
wonder
if
she
feels
toward
me
as
i
feel
toward
her
surely
she
does
what
other
reason
could
bring
her
here
to
meet
me
unless
she
is
a
brazen
wanton
creature
who
is
for
every
man
then
came
a
jealous
thought
that
hurt
him
like
the
piercing
of
a
knife
it
lasted
but
a
moment
however
and
he
continued
muttering
to
himself
if
she
loves
me
and
will
be
my
wife
i
will
i
will
in
god
name
what
will
i
do
if
i
were
to
marry
her
old
vernon
would
kill
her
and
i
i
should
kill
my
father
then
john
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
homeward
the
unhappiest
happy
man
in
england
he
had
made
perilous
strides
toward
that
pinnacle
sans
honor
sans
caution
sans
conscience
sans
everything
but
love
that
evening
while
we
were
walking
on
the
battlements
smoking
john
told
me
of
his
interview
with
dorothy
and
extolled
her
beauty
grace
and
winsomeness
which
in
truth
as
you
know
were
matchless
but
when
he
spoke
of
her
sweet
shy
modesty
i
came
near
to
laughing
in
his
face
did
she
not
write
a
letter
asking
you
to
meet
her
i
asked
why
returned
john
and
i
continued
has
she
not
from
the
first
sought
you
it
almost
seems
to
be
so
answered
john
but
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
one
might
say
might
call
that
one
might
feel
that
her
conduct
is
that
it
might
be
you
know
well
it
might
be
called
by
some
persons
not
knowing
all
the
facts
in
the
case
immodest
i
hate
to
use
the
word
with
reference
to
her
yet
it
does
not
appear
to
me
to
have
been
at
all
immodest
in
mistress
vernon
and
sir
malcolm
i
should
be
deeply
offended
were
any
of
my
friends
to
intimate
now
john
i
returned
laughing
at
him
you
could
not
if
you
wished
make
me
quarrel
with
you
and
if
you
desire
it
i
will
freely
avow
my
firm
belief
in
the
fact
that
my
cousin
dorothy
is
the
flower
of
modesty
does
that
better
suit
you
i
could
easily
see
that
my
bantering
words
did
not
suit
him
at
all
but
i
laughed
at
him
and
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
show
his
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
he
returned
but
in
plain
words
i
do
not
like
the
tone
in
which
you
speak
of
her
it
hurts
me
and
i
do
not
believe
you
would
wilfully
give
me
pain
indeed
i
would
not
i
answered
seriously
mistress
vernon
conduct
toward
me
john
continued
has
been
gracious
there
has
been
no
immodesty
nor
boldness
in
it
i
laughed
again
and
said
i
make
my
humble
apologies
to
her
majesty
queen
dorothy
but
in
all
earnestness
sir
john
you
are
right
dorothy
is
modest
and
pure
as
for
her
conduct
toward
you
there
is
a
royal
quality
about
beauty
such
as
my
cousin
possesses
which
gives
an
air
of
graciousness
to
acts
that
in
a
plainer
girl
would
seem
bold
beauty
like
royalty
has
its
own
prerogatives
for
a
fortnight
after
the
adventures
just
related
john
in
pursuance
of
his
resolution
not
to
see
dorothy
rode
every
evening
to
bowling
green
gate
but
during
that
time
he
failed
to
see
her
and
the
resolutions
with
each
failure
became
weaker
and
fewer
one
evening
after
many
disappointments
john
came
to
my
room
bearing
in
his
hands
a
letter
which
he
said
jennie
faxton
had
delivered
to
him
at
bowling
green
gate
mistress
vernon
said
john
and
lady
madge
stanley
will
ride
to
they
will
go
in
the
haddon
hall
coach
and
dawson
will
drive
mistress
vernon
writes
to
me
thus
sir
john
manners
good
wishes
and
my
kind
greeting
lady
madge
stanley
my
good
aunt
lady
crawford
and
myself
do
intend
journeying
to
my
aunt
lady
crawford
is
slightly
ill
and
although
i
should
much
regret
to
see
her
sickness
grow
greater
yet
if
ill
she
must
be
i
do
hope
that
her
worst
day
will
be
upon
the
morrow
in
which
case
she
could
not
accompany
lady
madge
and
me
i
shall
nurse
my
good
aunt
carefully
this
day
and
shall
importune
her
to
take
plentifully
of
physic
that
she
may
quickly
recover
her
health
after
should
a
gentleman
ask
of
will
dawson
who
will
be
in
the
of
the
royal
arms
at
eleven
of
the
morning
dawson
will
be
glad
to
inform
the
gentleman
concerning
lady
health
let
us
hope
that
the
physic
will
cure
lady
crawford
by
the
day
after
at
furthest
the
said
will
dawson
may
be
trusted
with
great
respect
dorothy
vernon
i
suppose
the
gentleman
will
be
solicitous
concerning
lady
health
morning
at
eleven
said
i
the
gentleman
is
now
solicitous
concerning
lady
crawford
health
answered
john
laughingly
was
there
ever
a
lady
more
fair
and
gracious
than
mistress
vernon
i
smiled
with
a
superior
air
at
john
weakness
being
as
you
know
entirely
free
from
his
complaint
myself
and
john
continued
perhaps
you
would
call
mistress
dorothy
bold
for
sending
me
this
letter
it
is
redolent
with
shyness
i
answered
but
would
you
really
wish
poor
lady
crawford
to
be
ill
that
you
might
witness
mistress
modesty
please
do
jest
on
that
subject
said
john
seriously
i
would
wish
anything
i
fear
that
would
bring
me
an
opportunity
to
see
her
to
look
upon
her
face
and
to
hear
her
voice
for
her
i
believe
i
would
sacrifice
every
one
who
is
dear
to
me
one
day
she
shall
be
mine
mine
at
whatever
cost
if
she
will
be
if
she
will
be
ah
there
is
the
rub
if
she
will
be
i
dare
not
hope
for
that
i
think
said
i
that
you
really
have
some
little
cause
to
hope
you
speak
in
the
same
tone
again
malcolm
you
do
not
understand
her
she
might
love
me
to
the
extent
that
i
sometimes
hope
but
her
father
and
mine
would
never
consent
to
our
union
and
she
i
fear
could
not
be
induced
to
marry
me
under
those
conditions
do
not
put
the
hope
into
my
heart
you
only
now
said
she
should
be
yours
some
day
i
answered
so
she
shall
returned
john
so
she
shall
but
lady
madge
is
to
be
with
her
said
i
my
own
heart
beating
with
an
ardent
wish
and
a
hope
and
you
may
be
unable
after
all
to
see
mistress
dorothy
that
is
true
replied
john
i
do
not
know
how
she
will
arrange
matters
but
i
have
faith
in
her
ingenuity
well
might
he
have
faith
for
dorothy
was
possessed
of
that
sort
of
a
will
which
usually
finds
a
way
if
you
wish
me
to
go
with
you
to
i
will
do
so
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
entertain
lady
madge
while
you
have
a
word
with
dorothy
what
think
you
of
the
plan
i
asked
if
you
will
go
with
me
malcolm
i
shall
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
and
so
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
we
should
both
go
to
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
about
lady
crawford
health
though
for
me
the
expedition
was
full
of
hazard
chapter
vi
a
dangerous
trip
to
the
next
morning
broke
brightly
but
soon
clouds
began
to
gather
and
a
storm
seemed
imminent
we
feared
that
the
gloomy
prospect
of
the
sky
might
keep
dorothy
and
madge
at
home
but
long
before
the
appointed
hour
john
and
i
were
at
the
royal
arms
watching
eagerly
for
the
haddon
coach
at
the
inn
we
occupied
a
room
from
which
we
could
look
into
the
courtyard
and
at
the
window
we
stood
alternating
between
exaltation
and
despair
when
my
cogitations
turned
upon
myself
a
palpitating
youth
of
waiting
with
beating
heart
for
a
simple
blind
girl
little
more
than
half
my
age
and
when
i
remembered
how
for
years
i
had
laughed
at
the
tenderness
of
the
fairest
women
of
the
french
and
scottish
courts
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
poor
fool
you
have
achieved
an
early
second
childhood
but
when
i
recalled
madge
in
all
her
beauty
purity
and
helplessness
my
cynicism
left
me
and
i
who
had
enjoyed
all
of
life
ambitious
possibilities
calmly
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
is
sometimes
a
blessed
privilege
to
be
a
fool
while
i
dwelt
on
thoughts
of
madge
all
the
latent
good
within
me
came
uppermost
there
is
latent
good
in
every
man
though
it
may
remain
latent
all
his
life
good
resolves
pure
thoughts
and
noble
aspirations
new
sensations
to
me
i
blush
to
confess
bubbled
in
my
heart
and
i
made
a
mental
prayer
if
this
is
folly
may
god
banish
wisdom
what
is
there
after
all
is
said
in
wisdom
that
men
should
seek
it
has
it
ever
brought
happiness
to
its
possessor
i
am
an
old
man
at
this
writing
i
have
tasted
all
the
cups
of
life
and
from
the
fulness
of
my
experience
i
tell
you
that
the
simple
life
is
the
only
one
wherein
happiness
is
found
when
you
permit
your
heart
and
your
mind
to
grow
complex
and
wise
you
make
nooks
and
crannies
for
wretchedness
to
lodge
in
innocence
is
nature
wisdom
knowledge
is
man
folly
an
hour
before
noon
our
patience
was
rewarded
when
we
saw
the
haddon
hall
coach
drive
into
the
courtyard
with
dawson
on
the
box
i
tried
to
make
myself
believe
that
i
did
not
wish
lady
crawford
were
ill
but
there
is
little
profit
in
too
close
scrutiny
of
our
motives
and
in
this
case
i
found
no
comfort
in
i
really
did
wish
that
aunt
dorothy
were
my
motive
studying
however
was
brought
to
a
joyous
end
when
i
saw
will
dawson
close
the
coach
door
after
madge
and
dorothy
had
alighted
how
wondrously
beautiful
they
were
had
we
lived
in
the
days
when
olympus
ruled
the
world
john
surely
would
have
had
a
god
for
his
rival
dorothy
seemed
luminous
so
radiant
was
she
with
the
fire
of
life
as
for
madge
had
i
beheld
a
corona
hovering
over
her
head
i
should
have
thought
it
in
all
respects
a
natural
and
appropriate
phenomenon
so
fair
and
saintlike
did
she
appear
to
me
her
warm
white
furs
and
her
clinging
gown
of
soft
woollen
stuff
seemed
to
be
a
saint
robe
and
her
dainty
little
hat
fashioned
with
ermine
about
the
edge
of
the
rim
well
that
was
the
corona
and
i
was
ready
to
worship
dorothy
as
befitted
her
wore
a
blaze
of
harmonious
colors
and
looked
like
the
spirit
of
life
and
youth
i
wish
i
could
cease
rhapsodizing
over
those
two
girls
but
i
can
not
you
may
pass
over
it
as
you
read
if
you
do
not
like
it
ye
gods
did
ever
a
creature
so
perfect
as
she
tread
the
earth
asked
john
meaning
of
course
dorothy
no
answered
i
meaning
of
course
madge
the
girls
entered
the
inn
and
john
and
i
descended
to
the
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
will
dawson
concerning
the
state
of
aunt
dorothy
health
when
we
entered
the
will
was
standing
near
the
fireplace
with
a
mug
of
hot
punch
in
his
hand
when
i
touched
him
he
almost
dropped
the
mug
so
great
was
his
surprise
at
seeing
me
sir
mal
he
began
to
say
but
i
stopped
him
by
a
gesture
he
instantly
recovered
his
composure
and
appeared
not
to
recognize
me
i
spoke
in
broken
english
for
as
you
know
i
belong
more
to
france
than
to
any
other
country
i
am
sir
françois
de
lorraine
said
i
i
wish
to
inquire
if
lady
crawford
is
in
good
health
her
ladyship
is
ill
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
responded
will
taking
off
his
hat
mistress
vernon
and
lady
madge
stanley
are
at
the
inn
if
you
wish
to
inquire
more
particularly
concerning
lady
crawford
health
i
will
ask
them
if
they
wish
to
receive
you
they
are
in
the
parlor
will
was
the
king
of
trumps
say
to
them
said
i
that
sir
françois
de
lorraine
mark
the
name
carefully
please
and
his
friend
desire
to
make
inquiry
concerning
lady
crawford
health
and
would
deem
it
a
great
honor
should
the
ladies
grant
them
an
interview
will
countenance
was
as
expressionless
as
the
face
upon
the
mug
from
which
he
had
been
drinking
i
shall
inform
the
ladies
of
your
request
he
thereupon
placed
the
mug
upon
the
and
left
the
room
when
will
announced
his
errand
to
the
girls
dorothy
said
in
surprise
sir
françois
de
lorraine
that
is
the
name
of
the
grand
duc
de
guise
but
surely
describe
him
to
me
will
he
is
about
your
height
mistress
dorothy
and
is
very
handsome
responded
will
the
latter
part
of
will
description
placed
me
under
obligation
to
him
to
the
extent
of
a
gold
pound
sterling
ah
it
is
john
thought
dorothy
forgetting
the
fact
that
john
was
a
great
deal
taller
than
she
but
feeling
that
will
description
of
very
handsome
could
apply
to
only
one
man
in
the
world
he
has
taken
malcolm
name
then
she
said
bring
him
to
us
will
but
who
is
the
friend
do
you
know
him
tell
me
his
appearance
i
did
not
notice
the
other
gentleman
replied
will
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
of
him
will
you
are
a
very
stupid
man
but
bring
the
gentlemen
here
dorothy
had
taken
will
into
her
confidence
to
the
extent
of
telling
him
that
a
gentleman
would
arrive
at
the
royal
arms
who
would
inquire
for
lady
crawford
health
and
that
she
dorothy
would
fully
inform
the
gentleman
upon
that
interesting
topic
will
may
have
had
suspicions
of
his
own
but
if
so
he
kept
them
to
himself
and
at
least
did
not
know
that
the
gentleman
whom
his
mistress
expected
to
see
was
sir
john
manners
neither
did
he
suspect
that
fact
dawson
had
never
seen
manners
and
did
not
know
he
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
derby
the
fact
was
concealed
from
dawson
by
dorothy
not
so
much
because
she
doubted
him
but
for
the
reason
that
she
wished
him
to
be
able
truthfully
to
plead
innocence
in
case
trouble
should
grow
out
of
the
escapade
i
wonder
why
john
did
not
come
alone
thought
dorothy
this
friend
of
his
will
be
a
great
hindrance
dorothy
ran
to
the
mirror
and
hurriedly
gave
a
few
touches
to
her
hair
pressing
it
lightly
with
her
soft
flexible
fingers
here
and
tucking
in
a
stray
curl
there
which
for
beauty
sake
should
have
been
allowed
to
hang
loose
she
was
standing
at
the
trying
to
see
the
back
of
her
head
when
will
knocked
to
announce
our
arrival
come
said
dorothy
will
opened
the
door
and
held
it
for
us
to
pass
in
madge
was
seated
near
the
fire
when
we
entered
dorothy
was
standing
with
great
dignity
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
not
of
course
intending
to
make
an
exhibition
of
delight
over
john
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
but
when
she
saw
that
i
was
the
stranger
she
ran
to
me
with
outstretched
hands
good
morning
mistress
vernon
said
i
in
mock
ceremoniousness
oh
malcolm
malcolm
cried
madge
quickly
rising
from
her
chair
you
are
cruel
dorothy
to
surprise
me
in
this
fashion
i
too
am
surprised
i
did
not
know
that
malcolm
was
coming
replied
dorothy
turning
to
give
welcome
to
john
then
i
stepped
to
madge
side
and
took
her
hands
but
all
i
could
say
was
madge
madge
and
all
she
said
was
malcolm
malcolm
yet
we
seemed
to
understand
each
other
john
and
dorothy
were
likewise
stricken
with
a
paucity
of
words
but
they
also
doubtless
understood
each
other
after
a
moment
or
two
there
fell
upon
me
a
shower
of
questions
from
dorothy
did
you
not
go
to
france
how
happens
it
that
you
are
in
where
did
you
meet
sir
john
what
a
delightful
surprise
you
have
given
us
nothing
was
wanting
to
make
us
happy
but
your
presence
i
am
so
happy
that
it
frightens
me
said
dorothy
in
ecstasy
trouble
will
come
i
am
sure
one
extreme
always
follows
another
the
pendulum
always
swings
as
far
back
as
it
goes
forward
but
we
are
happy
now
we
madge
i
intend
to
remain
so
while
i
can
the
pendulum
may
swing
as
far
backward
as
it
chooses
hereafter
sufficient
to
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
sometimes
the
joy
is
almost
sufficient
is
it
madge
the
evil
is
more
than
sufficient
some
days
answered
madge
come
madge
do
be
foreboding
dorothy
i
have
not
met
the
other
gentleman
said
madge
ah
pardon
me
in
my
surprise
i
forgot
to
present
you
lady
madge
stanley
let
me
present
sir
john
manners
sir
john
manners
cried
madge
taking
a
step
backward
her
surprise
was
so
great
that
she
forgot
to
acknowledge
the
introduction
dorothy
what
means
this
she
continued
it
means
replied
dorothy
nervously
that
sir
john
is
my
very
dear
friend
i
will
explain
it
to
you
at
another
time
we
stood
silently
for
a
few
moments
and
john
said
i
hope
i
may
find
favor
in
your
heart
lady
madge
i
wish
to
greet
you
with
my
sincere
homage
sir
john
i
am
glad
to
greet
you
but
i
fear
the
pendulum
of
which
dorothy
spoke
will
swing
very
far
backward
erelong
let
it
swing
as
far
back
as
it
chooses
answered
dorothy
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
am
ready
to
buy
and
to
pay
for
happiness
that
seems
to
be
the
only
means
whereby
we
may
have
it
i
am
ready
to
buy
it
with
pain
any
day
and
am
willing
to
pay
upon
demand
pain
passes
away
joy
lasts
forever
i
know
said
sir
john
addressing
madge
i
know
it
is
not
prudent
for
malcolm
and
me
to
be
here
but
imprudent
things
seem
to
be
the
most
delightful
for
men
sir
john
returned
madge
upon
women
they
leave
their
mark
i
fear
you
are
right
he
answered
i
had
not
thought
of
my
visit
in
that
light
for
mistress
vernon
sake
it
is
better
that
i
do
not
remain
in
derby
for
mistress
vernon
sake
you
shall
remain
cried
that
impetuous
young
woman
clutching
john
arm
after
a
time
dorothy
wishing
to
visit
one
of
the
shops
to
make
purchases
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
we
should
all
walk
out
neither
dorothy
nor
madge
had
ever
before
visited
john
and
i
had
visited
the
place
but
once
that
was
upon
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
no
one
in
the
town
knew
us
and
we
felt
safe
in
venturing
forth
into
the
streets
so
we
helped
dorothy
and
madge
to
don
their
furs
and
out
we
went
happier
and
more
reckless
than
four
people
have
any
good
right
to
be
but
before
setting
out
i
went
to
the
and
ordered
dinner
i
found
the
host
and
directed
him
to
prepare
a
dozen
partridges
in
a
pie
a
haunch
of
venison
a
few
links
of
german
sausage
and
a
capon
the
host
informed
me
that
he
had
in
his
pantry
a
barrel
of
roots
called
potatoes
which
had
been
sent
to
him
by
a
who
had
recently
returned
from
the
new
world
he
hurried
away
and
brought
a
potato
for
inspection
it
was
of
a
gray
brown
color
and
near
the
size
of
an
egg
the
landlord
assured
me
that
it
was
delicious
when
baked
and
i
ordered
four
at
the
cost
of
a
crown
each
i
understand
that
my
lord
raleigh
claims
to
have
brought
the
first
potatoes
and
tobacco
into
england
in
but
i
know
that
i
smoked
tobacco
in
and
i
saw
potatoes
at
the
royal
arms
in
in
i
also
ordered
another
new
dish
for
our
famous
dinner
it
was
a
brown
beverage
called
coffee
the
berries
from
which
the
beverage
is
made
mine
host
showed
to
me
and
said
they
had
been
brought
to
him
by
a
man
from
arabia
i
ordered
a
pot
of
the
drink
at
a
cost
of
three
crowns
i
have
heard
it
said
that
coffee
was
not
known
in
europe
or
in
england
till
it
was
introduced
by
rawolf
in
but
i
saw
it
at
the
royal
arms
in
in
addition
to
this
list
i
ordered
for
our
drinking
sweet
wine
from
madeira
and
red
wine
from
burgundy
the
wine
had
begun
to
grow
in
favor
at
the
french
court
when
i
left
france
five
years
before
it
was
little
liked
in
england
all
these
dainties
were
rare
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
but
they
have
since
grown
into
considerable
use
and
i
doubt
not
as
we
progress
in
luxury
they
will
become
common
articles
of
food
upon
the
tables
of
the
rich
prongs
or
forks
as
they
are
called
which
by
some
are
used
in
cutting
and
eating
one
food
at
table
i
also
predict
will
become
implements
of
daily
use
it
is
really
a
filthy
fashion
which
we
have
of
handling
food
with
our
fingers
the
italians
have
used
forks
for
some
time
but
our
preachers
speak
against
them
saying
god
has
given
us
our
fingers
with
which
to
eat
and
that
it
is
impious
to
thwart
his
purposes
by
the
use
of
forks
the
preachers
will
probably
retard
the
general
use
of
forks
among
the
common
people
after
i
had
given
my
order
for
dinner
we
started
out
on
our
ramble
through
shortly
after
we
left
the
inn
we
divided
into
couples
for
the
ostensible
reason
that
we
did
not
wish
to
attract
too
much
attention
dorothy
and
john
madge
and
i
our
real
reason
for
separating
was
but
you
understand
madge
hand
lay
like
a
span
of
snow
upon
my
arm
and
but
this
time
i
will
restrain
my
tendency
to
rhapsodize
we
walked
out
through
those
parts
of
the
town
which
were
little
used
and
madge
talked
freely
and
happily
she
fairly
babbled
and
to
me
her
voice
was
like
the
murmurings
of
the
rivers
that
flowed
out
of
paradise
we
had
agreed
with
john
and
dorothy
to
meet
them
at
the
royal
arms
in
one
hour
and
that
time
had
almost
passed
when
madge
and
i
turned
our
faces
toward
the
inn
when
we
were
within
a
short
distance
of
our
hostelry
we
saw
a
crowd
gathered
around
a
young
man
who
was
standing
on
a
box
he
was
speaking
in
a
mournful
lugubrious
voice
and
accompanied
his
words
with
violent
gesticulations
out
of
curiosity
we
stopped
to
listen
and
learned
that
religion
was
our
orator
theme
i
turned
to
a
man
standing
near
me
and
asked
who
is
the
fellow
speaking
the
pious
man
is
robert
brown
he
is
exhorting
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
pious
robert
brown
i
queried
exhorting
in
the
name
of
of
the
lord
of
where
did
you
say
hosts
laconically
responded
my
friend
while
listening
intently
to
the
words
of
brown
hosts
say
you
who
is
he
i
asked
of
my
interesting
neighbor
i
know
him
not
doubtless
you
know
him
not
responded
the
man
evidently
annoyed
at
my
interruption
and
my
flippancy
after
a
moment
or
two
i
desiring
to
know
more
concerning
the
orator
asked
robert
brown
say
you
even
he
came
the
response
it
will
be
good
for
your
soul
if
you
but
listen
to
him
in
a
prayerful
mood
he
is
a
young
man
upon
whom
the
spirit
hath
descended
plenteously
the
spirit
i
asked
ay
returned
my
neighbor
i
could
not
extract
another
word
from
him
so
i
had
the
worst
of
the
encounter
we
had
been
standing
there
but
a
short
time
when
the
young
exhorter
descended
from
his
improvised
pulpit
and
passed
among
the
crowd
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
money
his
harangue
had
appeared
ridiculous
to
me
but
madge
seemed
interested
in
his
discourse
she
said
he
is
very
earnest
malcolm
and
at
once
my
heart
went
out
to
the
young
enthusiast
upon
the
box
one
kind
word
from
madge
and
i
was
the
friend
for
life
i
would
have
remained
his
friend
had
he
permitted
me
that
high
privilege
but
that
he
would
not
do
when
he
came
to
me
i
dropped
into
his
hat
a
small
silver
piece
which
shone
brightly
among
a
few
black
copper
coins
my
liberal
contribution
did
not
induce
him
to
kindness
but
on
the
contrary
it
attracted
his
attention
to
the
giver
he
looked
at
the
silver
coin
and
then
turning
his
solemn
gaze
upon
me
eyed
me
insolently
from
head
to
foot
while
doing
so
a
look
of
profound
disgust
spread
over
his
mournful
countenance
after
a
calm
survey
of
my
person
which
to
me
was
uncomfortably
long
he
turned
to
the
bystanders
and
in
the
same
lugubrious
voice
which
he
had
used
when
exhorting
said
brethren
here
behold
ye
the
type
of
and
he
waved
his
thin
hand
toward
me
much
to
my
amusement
and
annoyance
here
said
he
we
find
the
leading
strings
to
all
that
is
iniquitous
vanity
it
is
betokened
in
his
velvets
satins
and
laces
think
ye
young
man
he
said
turning
to
me
that
such
vanities
are
not
an
abomination
in
the
eyes
of
the
god
of
israel
i
believe
that
the
god
of
israel
cares
nothing
about
my
apparel
i
replied
more
amused
than
angered
he
paid
no
attention
to
my
remark
and
this
young
woman
he
continued
pointing
to
madge
this
young
woman
daughter
of
the
roman
harlot
no
doubt
she
also
is
arrayed
in
silks
taffetas
and
fine
cloth
look
ye
friends
upon
this
abominable
collar
of
satan
this
ruff
of
fine
linen
all
smeared
in
the
devil
own
liquor
starch
her
vanity
is
an
offence
in
the
nostrils
of
god
people
as
he
spoke
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
caught
in
his
clawlike
grasp
the
dainty
white
ruff
that
encircled
madge
neck
when
i
saw
his
act
my
first
impulse
was
to
run
him
through
and
i
drew
my
sword
half
from
its
scabbard
with
that
purpose
but
he
was
not
the
sort
of
a
man
upon
whom
i
could
use
my
blade
he
was
hardly
more
than
a
boy
a
wild
fanatic
whose
reason
if
he
had
ever
possessed
any
had
been
lost
in
the
charybdis
of
his
zeal
he
honestly
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
insult
persons
who
apparently
disagreed
with
him
such
a
method
of
proselyting
is
really
a
powerful
means
of
persuasion
among
certain
classes
and
it
has
always
been
used
by
men
who
have
successfully
founded
permanent
religious
sects
to
plant
successfully
a
religious
thought
or
system
requires
more
violent
aggression
than
to
conquer
a
nation
since
i
could
not
run
the
fellow
through
i
drew
back
my
arm
and
striking
as
lightly
as
possible
i
laid
our
zealous
friend
sprawling
on
his
back
thus
had
i
the
honor
of
knocking
down
the
founder
of
the
brownists
if
i
mistake
not
the
time
will
come
if
these
men
are
allowed
to
harangue
the
populace
when
the
kings
of
england
will
be
unable
to
accomplish
the
feat
of
knocking
down
brown
followers
heresies
like
noxious
weeds
grow
without
cultivation
and
thrive
best
on
barren
soil
or
shall
i
say
that
like
the
goodly
vine
they
bear
better
fruit
when
pruned
i
can
not
fully
decide
this
question
for
myself
but
i
admire
these
sturdy
fanatics
who
so
passionately
love
their
own
faith
and
so
bitterly
hate
all
others
and
i
am
almost
prepared
to
say
that
each
new
heresy
brings
to
the
world
a
better
orthodoxy
for
a
little
time
after
my
encounter
with
brown
all
my
skill
was
needed
to
ward
off
the
frantic
hero
he
quickly
rose
to
his
feet
and
with
the
help
of
his
friends
seemed
determined
to
spread
the
gospel
by
tearing
me
to
pieces
my
sword
point
kept
the
rabble
at
a
respectful
distance
for
a
while
but
they
crowded
closely
upon
me
and
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
kill
some
of
them
had
i
not
been
reënforced
by
two
men
who
came
to
my
help
and
laid
about
them
most
joyfully
with
their
quarterstaffs
a
few
broken
heads
stemmed
for
a
moment
the
torrent
of
religious
enthusiasm
and
during
a
pause
in
the
hostilities
i
hurriedly
retreated
with
madge
ungratefully
leaving
my
valiant
allies
to
reap
the
full
reward
of
victory
should
the
fortunes
of
war
favor
them
madge
was
terribly
frightened
and
with
her
by
my
side
i
of
course
would
not
have
remained
to
fight
the
redoubtable
bayard
himself
we
hurried
forward
but
before
we
reached
the
inn
we
were
overtaken
by
our
allies
whom
we
had
abandoned
our
friends
were
young
men
one
wore
a
rich
habit
and
the
other
was
dressed
as
a
horse
boy
both
were
intoxicated
i
had
been
thankful
for
their
help
but
i
did
not
want
their
company
how
now
cousin
madge
said
our
richly
dressed
ally
what
in
the
devil
name
has
brought
you
into
this
street
broil
ah
cousin
james
is
it
you
replied
the
trembling
girl
yes
but
who
is
your
friend
that
so
cleverly
unloaded
his
quarrel
upon
us
hell
fires
but
they
were
like
a
swarm
of
wasps
who
is
your
friend
madge
sir
malcolm
vernon
replied
madge
let
me
present
you
sir
malcolm
to
my
cousin
lord
james
stanley
i
offered
my
hand
to
his
lordship
and
said
i
thank
you
much
for
your
timely
help
i
should
not
have
deserted
you
had
i
not
felt
that
my
first
duty
was
to
extricate
lady
madge
from
the
disagreeable
situation
we
must
hasten
away
from
here
or
the
mad
rabble
will
follow
us
right
you
are
my
hearty
returned
stanley
slapping
me
on
the
shoulder
of
course
you
had
to
get
the
wench
away
where
do
you
go
we
will
bear
you
company
i
longed
to
pay
the
fellow
for
his
help
by
knocking
him
down
but
the
possibilities
of
trouble
ahead
of
us
were
already
too
great
and
i
forced
myself
to
be
content
with
the
prowess
already
achieved
but
you
have
not
told
me
what
brought
you
into
the
broil
asked
his
lordship
as
we
walked
toward
the
inn
sir
malcolm
and
i
were
walking
out
to
see
the
town
and
to
see
the
town
by
gad
that
good
cousin
madge
how
much
of
it
did
you
see
you
are
as
blind
as
an
owl
at
noon
answered
his
lordship
alas
i
am
blind
returned
madge
clinging
closely
to
me
and
shrinking
from
her
cousin
terrible
jest
i
could
not
think
of
anything
sufficiently
holy
and

and
me
in
our
battle
with
the
brownists
i
was
at
a
loss
what
course
to
pursue
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
this
fellow
company
and
to
endure
patiently
his
insolence
but
john
and
dorothy
would
soon
return
and
there
is
no
need
that
i
should
explain
the
dangers
of
the
predicament
which
would
then
ensue
when
we
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
inn
door
i
looked
backward
and
saw
dorothy
and
john
approaching
us
i
held
up
my
hand
warningly
john
caught
my
meaning
and
instantly
leaving
dorothy
side
entered
an
adjacent
shop
my
movement
had
attracted
stanley
attention
and
he
turned
in
the
direction
i
had
been
looking
when
he
saw
dorothy
he
turned
again
to
me
and
asked
is
that
dorothy
vernon
yes
i
replied

at
her
tod
exclaimed
my
lord

at
her
tod
the
dad
was
right
about
her
after
all
i
thought
the
old
man
was
hoaxing
me
when
he
told
me
that
she
was
beautiful
holy
virgin
tod
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
handsome

will
take
her

enough

will

dorothy
approached
to
within
a
few
yards
of
us
and
my
lord
stanley
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
ye
do
know
me
do
ye
said
stanley
dorothy
was
frightened
and
quickly
stepped
to
my
side
i
i
believe
not
responded
dorothy
lord
james
stanley
murmured
madge
who
knew
of
the
approaching
stanley
marriage
madge
is
right
returned
stanley
grinning
foolishly
i
am
your
cousin
james
but
not
so
much
of
a
cousin
that
i
can
not
be
more
than
cousin
heh
he
laughed
boisterously
and
winking
at
tod
thrust
his
thumb
into
that
worthy
ribs
say
tod
something
more
than
cousin
that
the
thing
is
it
tod
john
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
shop
in
which
he
had
sought
refuge
dorothy
well
knew
the
peril
of
the
situation
and
when
i
frowned
at
her
warningly
she
caught
the
hint
that
she
should
not
resent
stanley
words
however
insulting
and
irritating
they
might
become
let
us
go
to
the
inn
said
dorothy
that
the
thing
to
do
let
us
go
to
the
inn
and
have
dinner
said
stanley
it
two
hours
past
dinner
time
now
and
i
almost
famished
we
have
a
famous
dinner
come
cousin
said
he
addressing
dorothy
we
have
kidneys
and
tripe
and
we
do
not
want
dinner
said
dorothy
we
must
return
home
at
once
sir
malcolm
will
you
order
dawson
to
bring
out
the
coach
we
went
to
the
inn
parlor
and
i
loath
to
do
so
left
the
ladies
with
stanley
and
his
friend
while
i
sought
dawson
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
to
fetch
the
coach
with
all
haste
we
have
not
dined
said
the
forester
we
shall
not
dine
i
answered
fetch
the
coach
with
all
the
haste
you
can
make
the
bystanders
in
the
were
listening
and
i
continued
a
storm
is
brewing
and
we
must
hasten
home
true
enough
a
storm
was
brewing
when
i
left
dawson
i
hurriedly
found
john
and
told
him
we
were
preparing
to
leave
the
inn
and
that
we
would
expect
him
to
overtake
us
on
the
road
to
rowsley
i
returned
to
the
ladies
in
the
parlor
and
found
them
standing
near
the
window
stanley
had
tried
to
kiss
dorothy
and
she
had
slapped
his
face
fortunately
he
had
taken
the
blow
and
was
pouring
into
her
unwilling
ear
a
fusillade
of
boorish
compliments
when
i
entered
the
parlor
i
said
the
coach
is
ready
the
ladies
moved
toward
the
door
i
am
going
to
ride
with
you
my
beauty
said
his
lordship
that
you
shall
not
do
retorted
dorothy
with
blazing
eyes
that
i
will
do
he
answered
the
roads
are
free
to
all
and
you
can
not
keep
me
from
following
you
dorothy
was
aware
of
her
predicament
and
i
too
saw
it
but
could
find
no
way
out
of
it
i
was
troubled
a
moment
but
my
fear
was
needless
for
dorothy
was
equal
to
the
occasion
we
should
like
your
company
cousin
stanley
replied
dorothy
without
a
trace
of
anger
in
her
manner
but
we
can
not
let
you
ride
with
us
in
the
face
of
the
storm
that
is
brewing
we
wo
mind
the
storm
will
we
tod
we
are
going
with
our
cousin
if
you
insist
upon
being
so
kind
to
us
said
dorothy
you
may
come
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
dinner
i
am
very
hungry
and
we
accept
your
invitation
now
you
are
coming
around
nicely
said
lord
james
joyfully
we
like
that
do
we
tod
tod
had
been
silent
under
all
circumstances
dorothy
continued
madge
and
i
will
drive
in
the
coach
to
one
or
two
of
the
shops
and
we
shall
return
in
one
hour
meantime
cousin
stanley
we
wish
you
to
have
a
fine
dinner
prepared
for
us
and
we
promise
to
do
ample
justice
to
the
fare
she
never
come
back
said
silent
tod
without
moving
a
muscle
how
about
it
cousin
asked
stanley
tod
says
you
never
come
back
he
means
that
you
are
trying
to
give
us
the
slip
never
fear
cousin
stanley
she
returned
i
am
too
eager
for
dinner
not
to
come
back
if
you
fail
to
have
a
table
for
me
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
we
then
went
to
the
coach
and
as
the
ladies
entered
it
dorothy
said
aloud
to
dawson
drive
to
conn
shop
i
heard
tod
say
to
his
worthy
master
she
a
slippin
ye
you
a
fool
tod
do
you
see
she
wants
me
more
than
she
wants
the
dinner
and
she
hungry
too
do
see
retorted
his
laconic
friend
of
course
when
the
coach
was
well
away
from
the
inn
dawson
received
new
instructions
and
took
the
road
to
rowsley
when
the
ladies
had
departed
i
went
to
the
with
stanley
and
after
paying
the
host
for
the
coffee
the
potatoes
and
the
dinner
which
alas
we
had
not
tasted
i
ordered
a
great
bowl
of
sack
and
proceeded
to
drink
with
my
allies
in
the
hope
that
i
might
make
them
too
drunk
to
follow
us
within
half
an
hour
i
discovered
that
i
was
laboring
at
a
hopeless
task
there
was
great
danger
that
i
would
be
the
first
to
succumb
so
i
expressing
a
wish
to
sleep
off
the
liquor
before
the
ladies
should
return
made
my
escape
from
the
mounted
my
horse
and
galloped
furiously
after
dorothy
and
madge
john
was
riding
by
the
coach
when
i
overtook
it
it
was
two
hours
past
noon
when
i
came
up
with
john
and
the
girls
snow
had
been
falling
softly
earlier
in
the
afternoon
but
as
the
day
advanced
the
storm
grew
in
violence
a
cold
bleak
wind
was
blowing
from
the
north
and
by
reason
of
the
weather
and
because
of
the
ill
condition
of
the
roads
the
progress
of
the
coach
was
so
slow
that
darkness
overtook
us
before
we
had
finished
half
of
our
journey
to
rowsley
upon
the
fall
of
night
the
storm
increased
in
violence
and
the
snow
came
in
piercing
horizontal
shafts
which
stung
like
the
prick
of
a
needle
at
the
hour
of
six
i
but
guessed
the
time
john
and
i
who
were
riding
at
the
rear
of
the
coach
heard
close
on
our
heels
the
trampling
of
horses
i
rode
forward
to
dawson
who
was
in
the
coach
box
and
told
him
to
drive
with
all
the
speed
he
could
make
i
informed
him
that
some
one
was
following
us
and
that
i
feared
highwaymen
were
on
our
track
hardly
had
i
finished
speaking
to
dawson
when
i
heard
the
report
of
a
back
of
the
coach
near
the
spot
where
i
had
left
john
i
quickly
drew
my
sword
though
it
was
a
task
of
no
small
labor
owing
to
the
numbness
of
my
fingers
i
breathed
along
the
blade
to
warm
it
and
then
i
hastened
to
john
whom
i
found
in
a
desperate
conflict
with
three
ruffians
no
better
swordsman
than
john
ever
drew
blade
and
he
was
holding
his
ground
in
the
darkness
right
gallantly
when
i
rode
to
his
rescue
another
was
discharged
and
then
another
and
i
knew
that
we
need
have
no
more
fear
from
bullets
for
the
three
men
had
discharged
their
weapons
and
they
could
not
reload
while
john
and
i
were
engaging
them
i
heard
the
bullets
tell
upon
the
coach
and
i
heard
the
girls
screaming
lustily
i
feared
they
had
been
wounded
but
you
may
be
sure
i
had
no
leisure
to
learn
the
truth
three
against
two
was
terrible
odds
in
the
dark
where
brute
force
and
luck
go
for
more
than
skill
we
fought
desperately
for
a
while
but
in
the
end
we
succeeded
in
beating
off
the
highwaymen
when
we
had
finished
with
the
knaves
who
had
attacked
us
we
quickly
overtook
our
party
we
were
calling
dawson
to
stop
when
we
saw
the
coach
careening
with
the
slant
of
the
hill
topple
over
and
fall
to
the
bottom
of
a
little
precipice
five
or
six
feet
in
height
we
at
once
dismounted
and
jumped
down
the
declivity
to
the
coach
which
lay
on
its
side
almost
covered
by
drifted
snow
the
pole
had
broken
in
the
fall
and
the
horses
were
standing
on
the
road
we
first
saw
dawson
he
was
swearing
like
a
dutchman
and
when
we
had
dragged
him
from
his
snowy
grave
we
opened
the
coach
door
lifted
out
the
ladies
and
seated
them
upon
the
uppermost
side
of
the
coach
they
were
only
slightly
bruised
but
what
they
lacked
in
bruises
they
made
up
in
fright
in
respect
to
the
latter
it
were
needless
for
me
to
attempt
a
description
we
can
laugh
about
it
now
and
speak
lightly
concerning
the
adventure
and
as
a
matter
of
truth
the
humor
of
the
situation
appealed
to
me
even
then
but
imagine
yourself
in
the
predicament
and
you
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
setting
forth
its
real
terrors
the
snow
was
up
to
our
belts
and
we
did
not
at
first
know
how
we
were
to
extricate
the
ladies
john
and
dawson
however
climbed
to
the
road
and
i
carried
dorothy
and
madge
to
the
little
precipice
where
the
two
men
at
the
top
lifted
them
from
my
arms
the
coach
was
broken
and
when
i
climbed
to
the
road
john
dawson
and
myself
held
a
council
of
war
against
the
storm
dawson
said
we
were
three
good
miles
from
rowsley
and
that
he
knew
of
no
house
nearer
than
the
village
at
which
we
could
find
shelter
we
could
not
stand
in
the
road
and
freeze
so
i
got
the
blankets
and
robes
from
the
coach
and
made
riding
pads
for
dorothy
and
madge
these
we
strapped
upon
the
broad
backs
of
the
coach
horses
and
then
assisted
the
ladies
to
mount
i
walked
by
the
side
of
madge
and
john
performed
the
same
agreeable
duty
for
dorothy
dawson
went
ahead
of
us
riding
my
horse
and
leading
john
and
thus
we
travelled
to
rowsley
half
dead
and
nearly
frozen
over
the
longest
three
miles
in
the
kingdom
john
left
us
before
entering
the
village
and
took
the
road
to
rutland
intending
to
stop
for
the
night
at
a
cottage
two
miles
distant
upon
his
father
estates
i
was
to
follow
sir
john
when
the
ladies
were
safely
lodged
at
the
peacock
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
nothing
should
be
said
concerning
the
presence
of
any
man
save
dawson
and
myself
in
our
party
when
john
left
us
i
rode
to
the
peacock
with
dorothy
and
madge
and
while
i
was
bidding
them
my
violent
cousin
sir
george
entered
the
inn
dorothy
ran
to
her
father
and
briefly
related
the
adventures
of
the
night
dwelling
with
undeserved
emphasis
upon
the
help
i
had
rendered
she
told
her
father
the
statement
was
literally
true
that
she
had
met
me
at
the
royal
arms
where
i
was
stopping
and
that
she
had
through
fear
of
the
storm
and
in
dread
of
highwaymen
asked
me
to
ride
beside
their
coach
to
rowsley
when
i
saw
sir
george
enter
the
room
i
expected
to
have
trouble
with
him
but
after
he
had
spoken
with
dorothy
much
to
my
surprise
he
offered
me
his
hand
and
said
i
thank
you
malcolm
for
the
help
you
have
rendered
my
girls
and
i
am
glad
you
have
come
back
to
us
i
have
not
come
back
to
you
sir
george
said
i
withholding
my
hand
i
met
mistress
vernon
and
lady
madge
at
the
royal
arms
and
escorted
them
to
rowsley
for
reasons
which
she
has
just
given
to
you
i
was
about
to
depart
when
you
entered
tut
tut
malcolm
you
will
come
with
us
to
haddon
hall
to
be
ordered
away
again
sir
george
i
asked
i
did
not
order
you
to
go
you
left
in
a
childish
fit
of
anger
why
in
the
devil
name
did
you
run
away
so
quickly
could
you
not
have
given
a
man
time
to
cool
off
you
treated
me
very
badly
malcolm
sir
george
you
certainly
know
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
now
i
want
not
another
word
from
you
damme
i
say
not
another
word
if
i
ever
ordered
you
to
leave
haddon
hall
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
cried
sir
george
heartily
but
you
may
again
not
know
said
i
now
malcolm
do
be
a
greater
fool
than
i
was
if
i
say
i
did
not
order
you
to
leave
haddon
hall
ca
you
take
me
at
my
word
my
age
and
my
love
for
you
should
induce
you
to
let
me
ease
my
conscience
if
i
can
if
the
same
illusion
should
ever
come
over
you
again
that
is
if
you
should
ever
again
imagine
that
i
am
ordering
you
to
leave
haddon
hall

just
tell
me
to
go
to
the
devil
i
have
been
punished

already
man
come
home
with
us
here
is
dorothy
whom
i
love
better
than
i
love
myself
in
anger
i
might
say
the
same
thing
to
her
that
i
said
to
you
but
nonsense
malcolm
do
be
a
fool
come
home
with
us
haddon
is
your
home
as
freely
as
it
is
the
home
of
dorothy
madge
and
myself
the
old
gentleman
voice
trembled
and
i
could
not
withstand
the
double
force
of
his
kindness
and
my
desire
so
it
came
about
that
when
madge
held
out
her
fair
hand
appealingly
to
me
and
when
dorothy
said
please
come
home
with
us
cousin
malcolm
i
offered
my
hand
to
sir
george
and
with
feeling
said

us
make
this
promise
to
each
other
that
nothing
hereafter
shall
come
between
us
i
gladly
promise
responded
the
generous
impulsive
old
man
dorothy
madge
and
you
are
all
in
this
world
whom
i
love

shall
make
trouble
between
us
whatever
happens
we
will
each
forgive
the
old
gentleman
was
in
his
kindest
softest
mood
let
us
remember
the
words
said
i
i
give
my
hand
and
my
word
upon
it
cried
sir
george
how
easy
it
is
to
stake
the
future
upon
a
present
impulse
but
when
the
time
for
reckoning
comes
when
the
future
becomes
the
present
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
pay
the
priceless
present
for
the
squandered
past
next
morning
we
all
rode
home
to
haddon
how
sweet
the
words
sound
even
at
this
distance
of
time
and
there
was
rejoicing
in
the
hall
as
if
the
prodigal
had
returned
in
the
evening
i
came
upon
madge
unawares
she
was
softly
singing
a
plaintive
little
love
song
i
did
not
disturb
her
and
as
i
stole
away
again
i
said
to
myself
god
is
good
a
realization
of
that
great
truth
had
of
late
been
growing
upon
me
when
once
we
thoroughly
learn
it
life
takes
on
a
different
color
chapter
vii
tribulation
in
haddon
after
i
had
left
haddon
at
sir
george
tempestuous
order
he
had
remained
in
a
state
of
furious
anger
against
dorothy
and
myself
for
a
fortnight
or
more
but
after
her
adroit
conversation
with
him
concerning
the
stanley
marriage
wherein
she
neither
promised
nor
refused
and
after
she
learned
that
she
could
more
easily
cajole
her
father
than
command
him
dorothy
easily
ensconced
herself
again
in
his
warm
heart
and
took
me
into
that
capacious
abode
along
with
her
then
came
the
trip
to
derby
whereby
his
serene
lordship
james
stanley
had
been
enabled
to
see
dorothy
and
to
fall
in
love
with
her
winsome
beauty
and
whereby
i
was
brought
back
to
haddon
thereafter
came
events
crowding
so
rapidly
one
upon
the
heels
of
another
that
i
scarce
know
where
to
begin
the
telling
of
them
i
shall
not
stop
to
say
sir
george
told
me
this
or
madge
dorothy
or
john
told
me
that
but
i
shall
write
as
if
i
had
personal
knowledge
of
all
that
happened
after
all
the
important
fact
is
that
i
know
the
truth
concerning
matters
whereof
i
write
and
of
that
you
may
rest
with
surety
the
snow
lay
upon
the
ground
for
a
fortnight
after
the
storm
in
which
we
rode
from
derby
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
melted
and
the
sun
shone
with
the
brilliancy
and
warmth
of
springtide
so
warm
and
genial
was
the
weather
that
the
trees
flowers
and
shrubs
were
cozened
into
budding
forth
the
buds
were
withered
by
a
killing
frost
which
came
upon
us
later
in
the
season
at
a
time
when
the
spring
should
have
been
abroad
in
all
her
graciousness
and
that
year
was
called
the
year
of
the
leafless
summer
one
afternoon
sir
george
received
a
distinguished
guest
in
the
person
of
the
earl
of
derby
and
the
two
old
gentlemen
remained
closeted
together
for
several
hours
that
night
at
supper
after
the
ladies
had
risen
from
table
sir
george
dismissed
the
servants
saying
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
in
private
i
feared
that
he
intended
again
bringing
forward
the
subject
of
marriage
with
dorothy
but
he
soon
relieved
my
mind
the
earl
of
derby
was
here
he
has
asked
for
doll
hand
in
marriage
with
his
eldest
son
and
heir
lord
james
stanley
and
i
have
granted
the
request
indeed
i
responded
with
marvellous
intelligence
i
could
say
nothing
more
but
i
thought
in
truth
i
knew
that
it
did
not
lie
within
the
power
of
any
man
in
or
out
of
england
to
dispose
of
dorothy
vernon
hand
in
marriage
to
lord
james
stanley
her
father
might
make
a
murderess
out
of
her
but
countess
of
derby
never
sir
george
continued
the
general
terms
of
the
marriage
contract
have
been
agreed
upon
by
the
earl
and
me
and
the
lawyers
will
do
the
rest
what
is
your
feeling
in
the
matter
i
asked
aimlessly
my
feeling
cried
sir
george
why
sir
my
feeling
is
that
the
girl
shall
marry
stanley
just
as
soon
as
arrangements
can
be
made
for
the
wedding
ceremony
the
young
fellow
it
seems
saw
doll
at
the
day
you
came
home
and
since
then
he
is
eager
his
father
tells
me
for
the
union
he
is
coming
to
see
her
when
i
give
my
permission
and
i
will
send
him
word
at
as
early
a
date
as
propriety
will
admit
i
must
not
let
them
be
seen
together
too
soon
you
know
there
might
be
a
hitch
in
the
marriage
negotiations
the
earl
is
a
tight
one
in
business
matters
and
might
drive
a
hard
bargain
with
me
should
i
allow
his
son
to
place
doll
in
a
false
position
before
the
marriage
contract
is
signed
he
little
knew
how
certainly
dorothy
herself
would
avoid
that
disaster
he
took
a
long
draught
from
his
mug
of
toddy
and
winked
knowingly
at
me
saying
i
am
too
wise
for
that
have
you
told
dorothy
i
asked
no
he
replied
i
have
not
exactly
told
her
i
had
a
talk
with
her
a
few
days
ago
on
the
subject
though
the
earl
and
i
had
not
at
that
time
entirely
agreed
upon
the
terms
and
i
did
not
know
that
we
should
agree
but
i
told
her
of
the
pending
negotiations
because
i
wished
to
prepare
her
for
the
signing
of
the
contract
and
also
by
gad
malcolm
i
wanted
to
make
the
girl
understand
at
the
outset
that
i
will
have
no
trifling
with
my
commands
in
this
matter
i
made
that
feature
of
the
case
very
plain
you
may
rest
assured
she
understands
me
fully
and
although
at
first
she
was
a
little
inclined
to
fight
she
soon
she
soon
well
she
knuckled
under
gracefully
when
she
found
she
must
did
she
consent
to
the
marriage
i
asked
well
knowing
that
even
if
she
had
consented
in
words
she
had
no
thought
of
doing
so
in
deed
returned
sir
george
hesitatingly
i
congratulate
you
i
replied
i
shall
grieve
to
lose
doll
the
old
man
slowly
continued
with
perceptible
signs
of
emotion
i
shall
grieve
to
lose
my
girl
but
i
am
anxious
to
have
the
wedding
over
you
see
malcolm
of
late
i
have
noticed
signs
of
wilfulness
in
doll
that
can
be
more
easily
handled
by
a
husband
than
by
a
father
marriage
and
children
anchor
a
woman
you
know
in
truth
i
have
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
doll
is
growing
dangerous
the
other
day
i
thought
she
was
a
child
but
suddenly
i
learn
she
is
a
woman
i
had
not
before
noticed
the
change
beauty
and
wilfulness
such
as
the
girl
has
of
late
developed
are
powers
not
to
be
underestimated
by
wise
men
there
is
hell
in
them
malcolm
i
tell
you
there
is
hell
in
them
sir
george
meditatively
snuffed
the
candle
with
his
fingers
and
continued
if
a
horse
once
learns
that
he
can
kick
sell
him
only
yesterday
as
i
said
doll
was
a
child
and
now
by
jove
she
is
a
woman
and
i
catch
myself
standing
in
awe
of
her
and
calling
her
dorothy
yes
damme
standing
in
awe
of
my
own
child
that
will
never
do
you
know
what
has
wrought
the
change
and
after
all
what
is
the
change
i
ca
define
it
but
there
has
been
a
great
one
he
was
in
a
revery
and
spoke
more
to
himself
than
to
me
yesterday
she
was
my
child
she
was
a
child
and
now
and
now
she
is
she
is
why
the
devil
did
you
take
her
malcolm
cried
the
old
man
awakening
but
there
never
mind
that
is
all
past
and
gone
and
the
future
earl
of
derby
will
be
a
great
match
for
her
do
you
know
the
future
earl
of
derby
i
asked
have
you
ever
seen
him
no
sir
george
replied
i
hear
he
is
rather
wild
and
uncouth
but
my
dear
cousin
said
i
interrupting
him
he
is
a
vulgar
drunken
clown
whose
associates
have
always
been
stable
boys
tavern
maids
and
those
who
are
worse
than
either
what
cried
sir
george
hotly
the
liquor
having
reached
his
brain
you
wo
have
doll
yourself
and
you
wo
consent
to
another
damme
would
you
have
the
girl
wither
into
spinsterhood
how
sir
dare
you
interfere
i
withdraw
all
i
said
sir
george
i
replied
hastily
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
the
match
i
thought
well
damn
you
sir
do
think
you
said
you
wished
to
consult
me
about
the
affair
and
i
supposed
do
suppose
either
replied
sir
george
sullenly
supposing
and
thinking
have
hanged
many
a
man
i
did
wish
to
consult
you
i
simply
wanted
to
tell
you
of
the
projected
marriage
then
after
a
moment
of
sullen
silence
he
continued
go
to
bed
malcolm
go
to
bed
or
we
be
quarrelling
again
i
was
glad
enough
to
go
to
bed
for
my
cousin
was
growing
drunk
and
drink
made
a
demon
of
this
man
whose
violence
when
sober
was
tempered
by
a
heart
full
of
tenderness
and
love
next
morning
sir
george
was
feeling
irritable
from
the
effects
of
the
brandy
he
had
drunk
over
night
at
breakfast
in
the
presence
of
lady
crawford
madge
and
myself
he
abruptly
informed
dorothy
that
he
was
about
to
give
that
young
goddess
to
lord
james
stanley
for
his
wife
he
told
her
of
the
arrangement
he
had
made
the
day
before
with
the
earl
of
derby
lady
crawford
looked
toward
her
brother
in
surprise
and
madge
pushed
her
chair
a
little
way
back
from
the
table
with
a
startled
movement
dorothy
sprang
to
her
feet
her
eyes
flashing
fire
and
her
breast
rising
and
falling
like
the
pulsing
of
the
sea
i
coughed
warningly
and
placed
my
finger
on
my
lips
making
the
sign
of
silence
to
dorothy
the
girl
made
a
wondrous
and
beautiful
struggle
against
her
wrath
and
in
a
moment
all
signs
of
disappeared
and
her
face
took
on
an
expression
of
sweet
meekness
which
did
not
belong
there
of
right
she
quietly
sat
down
again
and
when
i
looked
at
her
i
would
have
sworn
that
griselda
in
the
flesh
was
sitting
opposite
me
sir
george
was
right
ways
such
as
the
girl
had
of
late
developed
were
dangerous
hell
was
in
them
to
an
extent
little
dreamed
of
by
her
father
breakfast
was
finished
in
silence
dorothy
did
not
come
down
to
dinner
at
noon
but
sir
george
did
not
mark
her
absence
at
supper
her
place
was
still
vacant
where
is
doll
cried
sir
george
angrily
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
during
the
afternoon
where
is
doll
he
demanded
she
is
on
the
terrace
answered
madge
she
said
she
did
not
want
supper
tell
your
mistress
to
come
to
supper
said
sir
george
speaking
to
one
of
the
servants
you
will
find
her
on
the
terrace
the
servant
left
the
room
but
soon
returned
saying
that
mistress
dorothy
wanted
no
supper
tell
her
to
come
to
the
table
whether
she
wants
supper
or
not
tell
her
i
will
put
a
stop
to
her
moping
about
the
place
like
a
surly
vixen
growled
sir
george
do
send
such
a
message
by
a
servant
pleaded
lady
crawford
then
take
it
to
her
yourself
dorothy
exclaimed
her
brother
dorothy
returned
with
her
aunt
and
meekly
took
her
place
at
the
table
i
will
have
none
of
your
moping
and
pouting
said
sir
george
as
dorothy
was
taking
her
chair
the
girl
made
no
reply
but
she
did
not
eat
eat
your
supper
her
father
commanded
i
tell
you
i
will
have
no
you
would
not
have
me
eat
if
i
am
not
hungry
would
you
father
she
asked
softly
i
have
you
hungry
you
perverse
wench
then
make
me
an
appetite
returned
the
girl
i
never
heard
more
ominous
tones
fall
from
human
lips
they
betokened
a
mood
in
which
one
could
easily
do
murder
in
cold
blood
and
i
was
surprised
that
sir
george
did
not
take
warning
and
remain
silent
i
can
not
make
an
appetite
for
you
fool
he
replied
testily
then
you
can
not
make
me
eat
retorted
dorothy
ah
you
would
answer
me
would
you
you
brazen
insolent
huzzy
cried
her
father
angrily
dorothy
held
up
her
hand
warningly
to
sir
george
and
uttered
the
one
word
father
her
voice
sounded
like
the
clear
low
ring
of
steel
as
i
have
heard
it
in
the
stillness
of
sunrise
during
a
duel
to
the
death
madge
gently
placed
her
hand
in
dorothy
but
the
caress
met
no
response
go
to
your
room
answered
sir
george
dorothy
rose
to
her
feet
and
spoke
calmly
i
have
not
said
that
i
would
disobey
you
in
regard
to
this
marriage
which
you
have
sought
for
me
and
your
harshness
father
grows
out
of
your
effort
to
reconcile
your
conscience
with
the
outrage
you
would
put
upon
your
own
flesh
and
blood
your
only
child
suffering
god
cried
sir
george
frenzied
with
anger
and
drink
am
i
to
endure
such
insolence
from
my
own
child
the
lawyers
will
be
here
the
contract
will
be
signed
and
thank
god
i
shall
soon
be
rid
of
you
i
place
you
in
the
hands
of
one
who
will
break
your
damnable
will
and
curb
your
vixenish
temper
then
he
turned
to
lady
crawford
dorothy
if
there
is
anything
to
do
in
the
way
of
gowns
and
women
trumpery
in
preparation
for
the
wedding
begin
at
once
for
the
ceremony
shall
come
off
within
a
fortnight
this
was
beyond
dorothy
power
to
endure
madge
felt
the
storm
coming
and
clutched
her
by
the
arm
in
an
effort
to
stop
her
but
nothing
could
have
done
that
i
marry
lord
stanley
she
asked
in
low
tones
full
of
contempt
and
disdain
marry
that
creature
father
you
do
know
me
by
god
i
know
myself
retorted
sir
george
and
i
say
now
hear
me
father
she
interrupted
in
a
manner
that
silenced
even
him
she
bent
forward
resting
one
fair
hand
upon
the
table
while
she
held
out
her
other
arm
bared
to
the
elbow
hear
what
i
say
and
take
it
for
the
truth
as
if
it
had
come
from
holy
writ
i
will
open
the
veins
in
this
arm
and
will
strew
my
blood
in
a
gapless
circle
around
haddon
hall
so
that
you
shall
tread
upon
it
whenever
you
go
forth
into
the
day
or
into
the
night
before
i
will
marry
the
drunken
idiot
with
whom
you
would
curse
me
ay
i
will
do
more
i
will
kill
you
if
need
be
should
you
try
to
force
him
on
me
now
father
we
understand
each
other
at
least
you
can
not
fail
to
understand
me
for
the
last
time
i
warn
you
beware
of
me
she
gently
pushed
the
chair
back
from
the
table
quietly
adjusted
the
sleeve
which
she
had
drawn
upward
from
her
wrist
and
slowly
walked
out
of
the
room
softly
humming
the
refrain
of
a
roundelay
there
was
no
trace
of
excitement
about
the
girl
her
brain
was
acting
with
the
ease
and
precision
of
a
perfectly
constructed
machine
sir
george
by
his
violence
and
cruelty
had
made
a
fiend
of
this
strong
passionate
tender
heart
that
was
all
the
supper
of
course
was
quickly
finished
and
the
ladies
left
the
room
sir
george
took
to
his
bottle
and
remained
with
it
till
his
servants
put
him
to
bed
i
slipped
away
from
him
and
smoked
a
pipe
in
front
of
the
kitchen
fire
then
i
went
early
to
my
bed
in
eagle
tower
dorothy
went
to
her
apartments
there
she
lay
upon
her
bed
and
for
a
time
her
heart
was
like
flint
soon
she
thought
of
her
precious
golden
heart
pierced
with
a
silver
arrow
and
tears
came
to
her
eyes
as
she
drew
the
priceless
treasure
from
her
breast
and
breathed
upon
it
a
prayer
to
the
god
of
love
for
help
her
heart
was
soft
again
soft
only
as
hers
could
be
and
peace
came
to
her
as
she
pressed
john
golden
heart
to
her
lips
and
murmured
over
and
over
the
words
my
love
my
love
my
love
and
murmuring
fell
asleep
i
wonder
how
many
of
the
countless
women
of
this
world
found
peace
comfort
and
ecstasy
in
breathing
those
magic
words
yesterday
how
many
have
found
them
how
many
will
find
them
no
one
can
tell
but
this
i
know
they
come
to
every
woman
at
some
time
in
her
life
righteously
or
unrighteously
as
surely
as
her
heart
pulses
that
evening
jennie
faxton
bore
a
letter
to
john
informing
him
of
the
projected
stanley
marriage
it
asked
him
to
meet
the
writer
at
bowling
green
gate
and
begged
him
to
help
her
if
he
could
the
small
and
intermittent
remnants
of
conscience
sense
of
duty
and
caution
which
still
remained
in
john
head
i
will
not
say
in
heart
for
that
was
full
to
overflowing
with
something
else
were
quickly
banished
by
the
unwelcome
news
in
dorothy
letter
his
first
impulse
was
to
kill
stanley
but
john
manners
was
not
an
assassin
and
a
duel
would
make
public
all
he
wished
to
conceal
he
wished
to
conceal
among
other
things
his
presence
at
rutland
he
had
two
reasons
for
so
desiring
first
in
point
of
time
was
the
urgent
purpose
with
which
he
had
come
to
derbyshire
that
purpose
was
to
further
a
plan
for
the
rescue
of
mary
stuart
and
to
bring
her
incognito
to
rutland
castle
as
a
refuge
until
elizabeth
could
be
persuaded
to
receive
her
of
this
plan
i
knew
nothing
till
after
the
disastrous
attempt
to
carry
it
out
of
which
i
shall
hereafter
tell
you
the
other
reason
why
john
wished
his
presence
at
rutland
unknown
was
that
if
he
were
supposed
to
be
in
london
no
one
would
suspect
him
of
knowing
dorothy
vernon
you
must
remember
there
had
been
no
overt
between
john
and
dorothy
up
to
that
time
the
scene
at
the
gate
approached
perilously
near
it
but
the
line
between
concealment
and
confession
had
not
been
crossed
mind
you
i
say
there
had
been
no
them
while
dorothy
had
gone
as
far
in
that
direction
as
a
maiden
should
dare
go
and
to
tell
the
exact
truth
a
great
deal
farther
john
had
remained
almost
silent
for
reasons
already
given
you
he
also
felt
a
fear
of
the
girl
and
failed
to
see
in
her
conduct
those
signs
of
intense
love
which
would
have
been
plainly
discernible
had
not
his
perceptions
been
blinded
by
the
fury
of
his
own
infatuation
he
had
placed
a
curb
on
his
passion
and
did
not
really
know
its
strength
and
power
until
he
learned
that
another
man
was
soon
to
possess
the
girl
he
loved
then
life
held
but
one
purpose
for
him
thus
you
see
that
when
dorothy
was
moaning
my
love
my
love
and
was
kissing
the
golden
heart
she
was
taking
a
great
deal
for
granted
perhaps
however
she
better
understood
john
feeling
for
her
than
did
he
himself
a
woman
sixth
sense
intuition
is
a
great
help
to
her
in
such
cases
perhaps
the
girl
knew
with
intuitive
confidence
that
her
passion
was
returned
and
perhaps
at
first
she
found
john
receptive
mode
of
wooing
sweeter
far
than
an
aggressive
attack
would
have
been
it
may
be
also
there
was
more
of
the
serpent
cunning
than
of
reticence
in
conduct
he
knew
well
the
ways
of
women
and
perhaps
he
realized
that
if
he
would
allow
dorothy
to
manage
the
entire
affair
she
would
do
his
wooing
for
him
much
better
than
he
could
do
it
for
himself
if
you
are
a
man
try
the
plan
upon
the
next
woman
whom
you
seek
to
win
if
she
happens
to
be
one
who
has
full
confidence
in
her
charms
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
result
women
lacking
that
confidence
are
restrained
by
fear
and
doubt
but
in
no
case
have
i
much
faith
in
the
process
at
the
opening
of
a
campaign
later
on
of
course
but
you
doubtless
are
quite
as
well
informed
concerning
this
important
subject
as
i
there
is
however
so
much
blundering
in
that
branch
of
science
that
i
have
a
mind
to
endow
a
college
at
oxford
or
at
paris
in
which
shall
be
taught
the
gentle
universally
needed
art
of
making
love
what
a
noble
attendance
such
a
college
would
draw
but
i
have
wandered
wofully
from
my
story
i
must
go
back
a
short
time
in
my
narrative
a
few
days
before
my
return
to
haddon
hall
the
great
iron
key
to
the
gate
in
the
wall
east
of
bowling
green
hill
was
missed
from
the
forester
closet
where
it
had
hung
for
a
century
or
more
bowling
green
hill
as
you
know
is
eastward
from
haddon
hall
a
distance
of
the
fourth
part
of
a
mile
and
the
gate
is
east
of
the
hill
about
the
same
distance
or
less
a
wall
is
built
upon
the
east
line
of
the
haddon
estate
and
east
of
the
wall
lies
a
great
trackless
forest
belonging
to
the
house
of
devonshire
in
olden
times
there
had
been
a
road
from
bakewell
to
rowsley
along
the
east
side
of
the
wall
but
before
sir
george
seizin
the
road
had
been
abandoned
and
the
gate
was
not
used
it
stood
in
a
secluded
unfrequented
spot
and
dorothy
thought
herself
very
shrewd
in
choosing
it
for
a
but
as
i
told
you
one
day
the
key
was
missed
it
was
of
no
value
or
use
and
at
first
nothing
was
thought
of
its
loss
but
from
time
to
time
the
fact
that
it
could
not
be
found
was
spoken
of
as
curious
all
the
servants
had
been
questioned
in
vain
and
the
loss
of
the
key
to
bowling
green
gate
soon
took
on
the
dignity
of
a
mystery
a
mystery
soon
to
be
solved
alas
to
dorothy
undoing
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
the
terrible
scene
between
sir
george
and
his
daughter
at
the
supper
table
dorothy
rode
forth
alone
upon
her
mare
dolcy
from
the
window
of
my
room
in
eagle
tower
i
saw
her
go
down
the
west
side
of
the
wye
toward
rowsley
i
ascended
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
and
from
that
elevation
i
saw
her
cross
the
river
and
soon
she
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
forest
at
that
time
i
knew
nothing
of
the
new
but
i
felt
sure
that
dorothy
had
gone
out
to
seek
john
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
its
gentle
warmth
enticed
me
to
remain
upon
the
tower
battlements
to
muse
and
to
dream
i
fetched
my
pipe
and
tobacco
from
my
room
i
had
been
smoking
at
intervals
for
several
months
but
had
not
entirely
learned
to
like
the
weed
because
of
a
slight
nausea
which
it
invariably
caused
me
to
feel
but
i
thought
by
practice
now
and
again
to
inure
myself
to
the
habit
which
was
then
so
new
and
fashionable
among
modish
gentlemen
while
i
smoked
i
mused
upon
the
past
and
present
and
tried
to
peer
into
the
future
a
fruitless
task
wherein
we
waste
much
valuable
time
a
vain
striving
like
eve
after
forbidden
knowledge
which
should
we
possess
it
would
destroy
the
little
remnant
of
eden
still
existing
on
earth
could
we
look
forward
only
to
our
joys
a
knowledge
of
the
future
might
be
good
to
have
but
imagine
if
you
can
the
horror
of
anticipating
evils
to
come
after
a
short
time
a
lotuslike
dreaminess
stole
over
me
and
past
and
future
seemed
to
blend
in
a
supreme
present
of
contentment
and
rest
then
i
knew
i
had
wooed
and
won
tobacco
and
that
thenceforth
i
had
at
hand
an
ever
ready
solace
in
time
of
trouble
at
the
end
of
an
hour
my
dreaming
was
disturbed
by
voices
which
came
distinctly
up
to
me
from
the
base
of
the
tower
i
leaned
over
the
battlements
to
listen
and
what
i
heard
gave
me
alarm
and
concern
such
as
all
the
tobacco
in
the
world
could
not
assuage
i
looked
down
the
dizzy
heights
of
eagle
tower
and
saw
sir
george
in
conversation
with
ben
shaw
a
woodman
i
had
not
heard
the
words
first
spoken
between
them
ay
ay
sir
george
said
ben
they
be
there
by
bowling
green
gate
now
i
saw
them
twenty
minutes
since
mistress
vernon
and
a
gentleman
perhaps
the
gentleman
is
sir
malcolm
answered
my
cousin
i
drew
back
from
the
battlements
and
the
woodman
replied
perhaps
he
be
but
i
doubt
it
there
had
been
a
partial
reconciliation
sincere
on
sir
george
part
but
false
and
hollow
on
dorothy
which
madge
had
brought
about
between
father
and
daughter
that
morning
sir
george
who
was
sober
and
repentant
of
his
harshness
was
inclined
to
be
tender
to
dorothy
though
he
still
insisted
in
the
matter
of
the
stanley
marriage
dorothy
anger
had
cooled
and
cunning
had
taken
its
place
sir
george
had
asked
her
to
forgive
him
for
the
hard
words
he
had
spoken
and
she
had
again
led
him
to
believe
that
she
would
be
dutiful
and
obedient
it
is
hard
to
determine
as
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
whether
dorothy
is
to
be
condemned
or
justified
in
the
woful
deception
she
practised
upon
her
father
to
use
a
plain
ugly
word
she
lied
to
him
without
hesitation
or
pain
of
conscience
still
we
must
remember
that
forty
years
ago
girls
were
frequently
forced
regardless
of
cries
and
piteous
agony
into
marriages
to
which
death
would
have
been
preferable
they
were
flogged
into
obedience
imprisoned
and
starved
into
obedience
and
alas
they
were
sometimes
killed
in
the
course
of
punishment
for
disobedience
by
men
of
sir
george
school
and
temper
i
could
give
you
at
least
one
instance
in
which
a
fair
girl
met
her
death
from
punishment
inflicted
by
her
father
because
she
would
not
consent
to
wed
the
man
of
his
choice
can
we
blame
dorothy
if
she
would
lie
or
rob
or
do
murder
to
avoid
a
fate
which
to
her
would
have
been
worse
than
death
when
you
find
yourself
condemning
her
now
or
hereafter
in
this
history
if
you
are
a
man
ask
yourself
this
question
if
i
had
a
sweetheart
in
dorothy
sad
case
should
i
not
wish
her
to
do
as
she
did
should
i
not
wish
if
it
were
possible
by
any
means
that
she
should
save
herself
from
the
worst
of
fates
and
should
save
me
from
the
agony
of
losing
her
to
such
a
man
as
sir
george
had
selected
for
dorothy
husband
is
it
not
a
sin
to
disobey
the
law
of
actively
or
passively
answer
these
questions
as
you
choose
as
for
myself
i
say
god
bless
dorothy
for
lying
perhaps
i
am
in
error
perhaps
i
am
not
i
but
tell
you
the
story
of
dorothy
as
it
happened
and
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
solving
questions
of
right
and
wrong
where
a
beautiful
woman
is
concerned
to
my
thinking
she
usually
is
in
the
right
in
any
case
she
is
sure
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when
sir
george
heard
the
woodman
story
he
started
hurriedly
toward
bowling
green
gate
now
i
shall
tell
you
of
dorothy
adventures
after
i
saw
her
cross
the
wye
when
she
reached
the
gate
john
was
waiting
for
her
ah
sir
john
i
am
so
glad
you
are
here
that
is
i
am
glad
you
are
here
before
i
arrived
good
even
said
the
girl
confusedly
her
heart
again
was
beating
in
a
provoking
manner
and
her
breath
would
not
come
with
ease
and
regularity
the
rapid
progress
of
the
malady
with
which
she
was
afflicted
or
blessed
was
plainly
discernible
since
the
last
meeting
with
my
friend
sir
john
that
is
it
would
have
been
plain
to
any
one
but
john
whose
ailment
had
taken
a
fatal
turn
and
had
progressed
to
the
state
of
blindness
by
the
help
of
the
stimulating
hope
and
fear
which
dorothy
letter
had
brought
to
him
he
had
planned
an
elaborate
conversation
and
had
determined
to
speak
decisive
words
he
hoped
to
receive
from
her
the
answer
for
which
he
longed
but
his
heart
and
breath
seemed
to
have
conspired
with
dorothy
to
make
intercommunication
troublesome
i
received
your
gracious
letter
mistress
vernon
and
i
thank
you
i
was
i
am
that
is
my
thanks
are
more
than
i
i
can
express
so
i
see
said
the
girl
half
amused
at
john
condition
although
it
was
but
little
worse
than
her
own
this
universal
malady
love
never
takes
its
blind
form
in
women
it
opens
their
eyes
under
its
influence
they
can
see
the
truth
through
a
millstone
the
girl
heart
jumped
with
joy
when
she
saw
john
manner
and
composure
quickly
came
to
her
relief
though
she
still
feigned
confusion
because
she
wished
him
to
see
the
truth
in
her
as
she
had
seen
it
in
him
she
well
knew
of
his
blindness
and
had
almost
begun
to
fear
lest
she
would
eventually
be
compelled
to
tell
him
in
words
that
which
she
so
ardently
wished
him
to
see
for
himself
she
thought
john
was
the
blindest
of
his
sex
but
she
was
to
a
certain
extent
mistaken
john
was
blind
as
you
already
know
but
his
reticence
was
not
all
due
to
a
lack
of
sight
he
at
least
had
reached
the
condition
of
a
hope
he
hoped
the
girl
cared
for
him
he
would
have
fully
believed
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
difficulty
he
found
in
convincing
himself
that
a
goddess
like
dorothy
could
care
for
a
man
so
unworthy
as
himself
most
modest
persons
are
that
was
john
condition
he
was
not
vain
jennie
brought
me
your
letter
also
said
the
girl
laughing
because
she
was
happy
though
her
merriment
somewhat
disconcerted
john
it
told
me
she
continued
that
you
would
come
i
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
and
and
the
gate
key
she
determined
this
time
to
introduce
the
key
early
in
the
engagement
but
i
feared
you
might
not
want
to
come
the
cunning
the
boldness
and
the
humility
of
the
serpent
was
in
the
girl
that
is
you
know
i
thought
perhaps
that
is
i
feared
that
you
might
not
come
your
father
might
have
been
ill
or
you
might
have
changed
your
mind
after
you
wrote
the
letter
no
answered
john
whose
face
was
beaming
with
joy
here
truly
was
a
goddess
who
could
make
the
blind
to
see
if
she
were
but
given
a
little
time
do
you
mean
that
your
father
is
not
ill
or
that
you
did
not
change
your
mind
asked
dorothy
whose
face
as
it
should
have
been
after
such
a
speech
was
bent
low
while
she
struggled
with
the
great
iron
key
entangled
in
the
pocket
of
her
gown
i
mean
that
i
have
not
changed
my
mind
said
john
who
felt
that
the
time
to
speak
had
come
there
has
been
no
change
in
me
other
than
a
new
access
of
eagerness
with
every
hour
and
a
new
longing
to
see
you
and
to
hear
your
voice
dorothy
felt
a
great
thrill
pass
through
her
breast
and
she
knew
that
the
reward
of
her
labors
was
at
hand
certainly
said
the
girl
hardly
conscious
of
her
words
so
great
was
the
joyous
tumult
in
her
heart
i
should
have
known
there
was
another
pause
devoted
to
the
key
with
bended
head
but
but
you
might
have
changed
your
mind
she
continued
and
i
might
not
have
known
it
for
you
see
i
did
not
know
your
former
state
of
mind
you
have
never
told
me
her
tongue
had
led
her
further
than
she
had
intended
to
go
and
she
blushed
painfully
and
i
think
considering
her
words
appropriately
my
letter
told
you
my
state
of
mind
at
least
it
told
you
of
my
intention
to
come
i
i
fear
that
i
do
not
understand
you
said
john
i
mean
she
replied
with
a
saucy
fluttering
little
laugh
as
she
looked
up
from
her
conflict
with
the
entangled
key
i
mean
that
that
you
know
what
i
mean
but
here
is
the
key
at
last
and
and
you
may
if
you
wish
come
to
this
side
of
the
gate
she
stepped
forward
to
unlock
the
gate
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
now
john
you
shall
have
a
clear
field
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
the
lock
had
been
removed
that
discovery
brought
back
to
john
his
wandering
wits
mistress
dorothy
he
cried
in
tones
of
alarm
i
must
not
remain
here
we
are
suspected
and
are
sure
to
be
discovered
your
father
has
set
a
trap
for
us
i
care
not
for
myself
but
i
would
not
bring
upon
you
the
trouble
and
distress
which
would
surely
follow
discovery
let
us
quickly
choose
another
place
and
time
of
meeting
i
pray

sweet
lady

me
at
this
time
near
the
white
cliff
back
of
lathkil
mill
i
have
that
to
say
to
you
which
is
the
very
blood
of
my
heart
i
must
now
leave
you
at
once
he
took
her
hand
and
kissing
it
started
to
leave
through
the
open
gate
the
girl
caught
his
arm
to
detain
him
say
it
now
john
say
it
now
i
have
dreamed
of
it
by
night
and
by
day
you
know
all
and
i
know
all
and
i
long
to
hear
from
your
lips
the
words
that
will
break
down
all
barriers
between
us
she
had
been
carried
away
by
the
mad
onrush
of
her
passion
she
was
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
and
she
spoke
because
she
could
not
help
it
i
will
speak
dorothy
god
help
me
god
help
me
i
will
speak
said
john
as
he
caught
the
girl
to
his
breast
in
a
fierce
embrace
i
love
you
i
love
you
god
himself
only
knows
how
deeply
how
passionately
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
fathom
its
depths
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
with
every
drop
of
blood
that
pulses
through
my
veins
i
love
you
i
adore
you
give
me
your
lips
my
beauty
my
aphrodite
my
queen
there
they
are
john
there
they
are
they
are
all
yours
all
yours
now
oh
god
my
blood
is
on
fire
she
buried
her
face
on
his
breast
for
shame
that
he
might
not
see
her
burning
eyes
and
her
scarlet
cheeks
then
after
a
time
she
cared
not
what
he
saw
and
she
lifted
her
lips
to
his
a
voluntary
offering
the
supreme
emotions
of
the
moment
drove
all
other
consciousness
from
their
souls
tell
me
dorothy
that
you
will
be
my
wife
tell
me
tell
me
cried
john
i
will
i
will
oh
how
gladly
how
gladly
tell
me
that
no
power
on
earth
can
force
you
to
marry
lord
stanley
tell
me
that
you
will
marry
no
man
but
me
that
you
will
wait
wait
for
me
till
i
will
marry
no
man
but
you
john
no
man
but
you
said
the
girl
whisperingly
her
head
was
thrown
back
from
his
breast
that
she
might
look
into
his
eyes
and
that
he
might
see
the
truth
in
hers
i
am
all
yours
but
oh
john
i
can
not
wait
i
can
not
do
not
ask
me
to
wait
it
would
kill
me
i
wear
the
golden
heart
you
gave
me
john
she
continued
as
she
nestled
closer
in
his
embrace
i
wear
the
golden
heart
always
it
is
never
from
me
even
for
one
little
moment
i
bear
it
always
upon
my
heart
john
here
it
is
she
drew
from
her
breast
the
golden
heart
and
kissed
it
then
she
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
said
i
kiss
it
twenty
times
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
ay
a
hundred
times
i
do
not
know
how
often
but
now
i
kiss
your
real
heart
john
and
she
kissed
his
breast
and
then
stood
tiptoe
to
lift
her
lips
to
his
there
was
no
room
left
now
in
john
heart
for
doubt
that
dorothy
vernon
was
his
own
forever
and
forever
she
had
convinced
him
beyond
the
reach
of
fear
or
doubt
john
forgot
the
lockless
gate
he
forgot
everything
but
dorothy
and
cruel
time
passed
with
a
rapidity
of
which
they
were
unconscious
they
were
however
brought
back
to
consciousness
by
hearing
a
long
blast
from
the
forester
bugle
and
john
immediately
retreated
through
the
gate
dorothy
then
closed
the
gate
and
hastily
seated
herself
upon
a
stone
bench
against
the
haddon
side
of
the
wall
she
quickly
assumed
an
attitude
of
listless
repose
and
dolcy
who
was
nibbling
at
the
grass
near
by
doubtless
supposed
that
her
mistress
had
come
to
bowling
green
gate
to
rest
because
it
was
a
secluded
place
and
because
she
desired
to
be
alone
dorothy
attitude
was
not
assumed
one
moment
too
soon
for
hardly
was
her
gown
arranged
with
due
regard
to
carelessness
when
sir
george
form
rose
above
the
crest
of
bowling
green
hill
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
standing
in
front
of
his
daughter
red
with
anger
dorothy
face
wore
a
look
of
calm
innocence
which
i
believe
would
have
deceived
solomon
himself
notwithstanding
that
great
man
experience
with
the
sex
it
did
more
to
throw
sir
george
off
the
scent
than
any
words
the
girl
could
have
spoken
who
has
been
with
you
demanded
sir
george
angrily
when
father
queried
the
girl
listlessly
resting
her
head
against
the
wall
now
this
afternoon
who
has
been
with
you
ben
shaw
said
that
a
man
was
here
he
said
that
he
saw
a
man
with
you
less
than
half
an
hour
since
that
piece
of
information
was
startling
to
dorothy
but
no
trace
of
surprise
was
visible
in
her
manner
or
in
her
voice
she
turned
listlessly
and
brushed
a
dry
leaf
from
her
gown
then
she
looked
calmly
up
into
her
father
face
and
said
laconically
but
to
the
point
ben
lied
to
herself
she
said
ben
shall
also
suffer
i
do
not
believe
that
ben
lied
said
sir
george
i
myself
saw
a
man
go
away
from
here
that
was
crowding
the
girl
into
close
quarters
but
she
did
not
flinch
which
way
did
he
go
father
she
asked
with
a
fine
show
of
carelessness
in
her
manner
but
with
a
feeling
of
excruciating
fear
in
her
breast
she
well
knew
the
wisdom
of
the
maxim
never
confess
he
went
northward
answered
sir
george
inside
the
wall
asked
dorothy
beginning
again
to
breathe
freely
for
she
knew
that
john
had
ridden
southward
inside
the
wall
of
course
her
father
replied
do
you
suppose
i
could
see
him
through
the
stone
wall
one
should
be
able
to
see
through
a
stone
wall
to
keep
good
watch
on
you
you
might
have
thought
you
saw
him
through
the
wall
answered
the
girl
i
sometimes
think
of
late
father
that
you
are
losing
your
mind
you
drink
too
much
brandy
my
dear
father
oh
would
it
be
dreadful
if
you
were
to
lose
your
mind
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
going
to
her
father
began
to
stroke
him
gently
with
her
hand
she
looked
into
his
face
with
real
affection
for
when
she
deceived
him
she
loved
him
best
as
a
partial
atonement
for
her
would
that
be
dreadful
she
continued
while
sir
george
stood
lost
in
bewilderment
would
that
be
dreadful
for
my
dear
old
father
to
lose
his
mind
but
i
really
think
it
must
be
coming
to
pass
a
great
change
has
of
late
come
over
you
father
you
have
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
been
unkind
to
me
and
suspicious
father
do
you
realize
that
you
insult
your
daughter
when
you
accuse
her
of
having
been
in
this
secluded
place
with
a
man
you
would
punish
another
for
speaking
so
against
my
fair
name
but
dorothy
sir
george
replied
feeling
as
if
he
were
in
the
wrong
ben
shaw
said
that
he
saw
you
here
with
a
man
and
i
saw
a
man
pass
toward
bakewell
who
was
he
i
command
you
to
tell
me
his
name
dorothy
knew
that
her
father
must
have
seen
a
man
near
the
gate
but
who
he
was
she
could
not
imagine
john
surely
was
beyond
the
wall
and
well
out
of
sight
on
his
way
to
rowsley
before
her
father
reached
the
crest
of
bowling
green
hill
but
it
was
evident
that
shaw
had
seen
john
evidence
that
a
man
had
been
at
the
gate
was
too
strong
to
be
successfully
contradicted
facts
that
can
not
be
successfully
contradicted
had
better
be
frankly
admitted
dorothy
sought
through
her
mind
for
an
admission
that
would
not
admit
and
soon
hit
upon
a
plan
which
shrewd
as
it
seemed
to
be
soon
brought
her
to
grief
perhaps
you
saw
cousin
malcolm
said
dorothy
as
the
result
of
her
mental
search
he
passed
here
a
little
time
since
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
talk
perhaps
you
saw
malcolm
father
you
would
not
find
fault
with
me
because
he
was
here
would
you
dorothy
my
daughter
said
sir
george
hesitatingly
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
then
the
fair
girl
lifted
up
her
beautiful
head
and
standing
erect
at
her
full
height
it
pains
me
to
tell
you
this
said
father
i
am
a
vernon
i
would
not
lie
her
manner
was
so
truthlike
that
sir
george
was
almost
convinced
he
said
i
believe
you
her
father
confidence
touched
her
keenly
but
not
to
the
point
of
repentance
i
hardly
need
say
dorothy
then
grew
anxious
to
return
to
the
hall
that
she
might
prepare
me
to
answer
whatever
idle
questions
her
father
should
put
to
me
she
took
dolcy
rein
and
leading
the
mare
with
one
hand
while
she
rested
the
other
upon
her
father
arm
walked
gayly
across
bowling
green
down
to
the
hall
very
happy
because
of
her
lucky
escape
but
a
lie
is
always
full
of
latent
retribution
i
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
dreamily
watching
the
huge
fire
when
dorothy
and
her
father
entered
ah
malcolm
are
you
here
asked
sir
george
in
a
peculiar
tone
of
surprise
for
which
i
could
see
no
reason
i
thought
you
were
walking
i
was
smoking
i
took
my
pipe
from
my
lips
and
said
no
i
am
helping
old
bess
and
jennie
with
supper
have
you
not
been
walking
asked
sir
george
there
was
an
odd
expression
on
his
face
when
i
looked
up
to
him
and
i
was
surprised
at
his
persistent
inquiry
concerning
so
trivial
a
matter
but
sir
george
expression
agitated
as
it
was
still
was
calm
when
compared
with
that
of
dorothy
who
stood
a
step
or
two
behind
her
father
not
only
was
her
face
expressive
but
her
hands
her
feet
her
whole
body
were
convulsed
in
an
effort
to
express
something
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
understand
her
wonderful
eyes
wore
an
expression
only
too
readable
of
terror
and
pleading
she
moved
her
hands
rapidly
and
stamped
her
foot
during
this
pantomime
she
was
forming
words
with
her
lips
and
nodding
her
head
affirmatively
her
efforts
at
expression
were
lost
upon
me
and
i
could
only
respond
with
a
blank
stare
of
astonishment
the
expression
on
my
face
caused
sir
george
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
my
gaze
and
he
did
so
just
in
time
to
catch
dorothy
in
the
midst
of
a
mighty
pantomimic
effort
at
mute
communication
why
in
the
devil
name
are
you
making
those
grimaces
demanded
sir
george
i
was
making
grimaces
i
i
think
i
was
about
to
sneeze
replied
dorothy
do
you
think
i
am
blind
stormed
sir
george
perhaps
i
am
losing
my
mind
you
are
trying
to
tell
malcolm
to
say
that
he
was
with
you
at
bowling
green
gate
losing
my
mind
am
i
damme
i
show
you
that
if
i
am
losing
my
mind
i
have
not
lost
my
authority
in
my
own
house
now
father
what
is
all
this
storming
about
asked
the
girl
coaxingly
as
she
boldly
put
her
hands
upon
her
father
shoulders
and
turned
her
face
in
all
its
wondrous
beauty
and
childish
innocence
of
expression
up
to
his
ask
malcolm
to
tell
you
whatever
you
wish
to
know
she
was
sure
that
her
father
had
told
me
what
she
had
been
so
anxious
to
communicate
and
she
felt
certain
that
i
would
not
betray
her
she
knew
that
i
whose
only
virtues
were
that
i
loved
my
friend
and
despised
a
lie
would
willingly
bear
false
witness
for
her
sake
she
was
right
i
had
caught
the
truth
of
the
situation
from
sir
george
and
i
quickly
determined
to
perjure
my
soul
if
need
be
to
help
dorothy
i
can
not
describe
the
influence
this
girl
at
times
exerted
over
me
when
under
its
spell
i
seemed
to
be
a
creature
of
her
will
and
my
power
to
act
voluntarily
was
paralyzed
by
a
strange
force
emanating
from
her
marvellous
vitality
i
can
not
describe
it
i
tell
you
only
the
incontestable
fact
and
you
may
make
out
of
it
whatever
you
can
i
shall
again
in
the
course
of
this
history
have
occasion
to
speak
of
dorothy
strange
power
and
how
it
was
exerted
over
no
less
a
person
than
queen
elizabeth
ask
malcolm
repeated
the
girl
leaning
coaxingly
upon
her
breast
but
i
was
saved
from
uttering
the
lie
i
was
willing
to
tell
for
in
place
of
asking
me
as
his
daughter
had
desired
sir
george
demanded
excitedly
of
dorothy
what
have
you
in
your
pocket
that
strikes
against
my
knee
mother
of
heaven
exclaimed
dorothy
in
a
whisper
quickly
stepping
back
from
her
father
and
slowly
lifting
her
skirt
while
she
reached
toward
her
pocket
her
manner
was
that
of
one
almost
bereft
of
consciousness
by
sudden
fright
and
an
expression
of
helplessness
came
over
her
face
which
filled
my
heart
with
pity
she
stood
during
a
long
tedious
moment
holding
with
one
hand
the
uplifted
skirt
while
with
the
other
she
clutched
the
key
in
her
pocket
what
have
you
in
your
pocket
demanded
sir
george
with
a
terrible
oath
bring
it
out
girl
bring
it
out
i
tell
you
dorothy
started
to
run
from
the
room
but
her
father
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
violently
drew
her
to
him
bring
it
out
huzzy
it
the
key
to
bowling
green
gate
ah
i
lost
my
mind
have
i
blood
of
christ
i
have
not
lost
my
mind
yet
but
i
soon
shall
lose
it
at
this
rate
and
he
certainly
looked
as
if
he
would
poor
frightened
dorothy
was
trying
to
take
the
key
from
her
pocket
but
she
was
too
slow
to
please
her
angry
father
so
he
grasped
the
gown
and
tore
a
great
rent
whereby
the
pocket
was
opened
from
top
to
bottom
dorothy
still
held
the
key
in
her
hand
but
upon
the
floor
lay
a
piece
of
white
paper
which
had
fallen
out
through
the
rent
sir
george
had
made
in
the
gown
he
divined
the
truth
as
if
by
inspiration
the
note
he
felt
sure
was
from
dorothy
unknown
lover
he
did
not
move
nor
speak
for
a
time
and
she
stood
as
if
paralyzed
by
fear
she
slowly
turned
her
face
from
her
father
to
me
and
in
a
low
tone
spoke
my
name
malcolm
her
voice
was
hardly
louder
than
a
whisper
but
so
piteous
a
cry
for
help
i
have
never
heard
from
human
lips
then
she
stooped
intending
to
take
the
letter
from
the
floor
and
sir
george
drew
back
his
arm
as
if
he
would
strike
her
with
his
clenched
hand
she
recoiled
from
him
in
terror
and
he
took
up
the
letter
unfolded
it
and
began
to
read
most
gracious
lady
i
thank
you
for
your
letter
and
with
god
help
i
will
meet
you
at
bowling
green
gate
the
girl
could
endure
no
more
she
sprang
with
a
scream
toward
her
father
and
tried
to
snatch
the
letter
sir
george
drew
back
holding
firmly
to
the
paper
she
followed
him
frantically
not
to
be
thrown
off
and
succeeded
in
clutching
the
letter
sir
george
violently
thrust
her
from
him
in
the
scuffle
that
ensued
the
letter
was
torn
and
the
lower
portion
of
the
sheet
remained
in
hand
she
ran
to
the
fireplace
intending
to
thrust
the
fragment
into
the
fire
but
she
feared
that
her
father
might
rescue
it
from
the
ashes
she
glanced
at
the
piece
of
paper
and
saw
that
the
part
she
had
succeeded
in
snatching
from
her
father
bore
john
name
sir
george
strode
hurriedly
across
the
room
toward
her
and
she
ran
to
me
malcolm
malcolm
she
cried
in
terror
the
cry
was
like
a
shriek
then
i
saw
her
put
the
paper
in
her
mouth
when
she
reached
me
she
threw
herself
upon
my
breast
and
clung
to
me
with
her
arms
about
my
neck
she
trembled
as
a
single
leaf
among
the
thousands
that
deck
a
tree
may
tremble
upon
a
still
day
moved
by
a
convulsive
force
within
itself
while
she
clung
to
me
her
glorious
bust
rose
and
fell
piteously
and
her
wondrous
eyes
dilated
and
shone
with
a
marvellous
light
the
expression
was
the
output
of
her
godlike
vitality
strung
to
its
greatest
tension
her
face
was
pale
but
terror
dominated
all
the
emotions
it
expressed
her
fear
however
was
not
for
herself
the
girl
who
would
have
snapped
her
fingers
at
death
saw
in
the
discovery
which
her
father
was
trying
to
make
loss
to
her
of
more
than
life
that
which
she
had
possessed
for
less
than
one
brief
hour
was
about
to
be
taken
from
her
she
had
not
enjoyed
even
one
little
moment
alone
in
which
to
brood
her
love
and
to
caress
the
sweet
thought
of
it
the
girl
had
but
a
brief
instant
of
rest
in
my
arms
till
sir
george
dragged
her
from
me
by
his
terrible
strength
where
is
the
paper
he
cried
in
rage
it
contained
the
signature
i
have
swallowed
it
father
and
you
must
cut
me
open
to
find
it
doubtless
that
would
be
a
pleasant
task
for
you
answered
dorothy
who
was
comparatively
calm
now
that
she
knew
her
father
could
not
discover
john
name
i
believe
sir
george
in
his
frenzy
would
have
killed
the
girl
had
he
then
learned
that
the
letter
was
from
john
manners
i
command
you
to
tell
me
this
fellow
name
said
sir
george
with
a
calmness
born
of
tempest
dorothy
did
not
answer
and
sir
george
continued
i
now
understand
how
you
came
by
the
golden
heart
you
lied
to
me
and
told
me
that
malcolm
had
given
it
to
you
lie
upon
lie
in
god
name
i
swear
that
i
would
rather
father
a
thief
than
a
liar
i
did
give
her
the
heart
sir
george
i
said
interrupting
him
it
was
my
mother
i
had
caught
the
lying
infection
but
sir
george
in
his
violence
was
a
person
to
incite
lies
he
of
course
had
good
cause
for
his
anger
dorothy
had
lied
to
him
of
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
her
deception
was
provoked
by
his
own
conduct
and
by
the
masterful
love
that
had
come
upon
her
i
truly
believe
that
prior
to
the
time
of
her
meeting
with
manners
she
had
never
spoken
an
untruth
nor
since
that
time
i
also
believe
except
when
driven
to
do
so
by
the
same
motive
dorothy
was
not
a
thief
but
i
am
sure
she
would
have
stolen
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
she
was
gentle
and
tender
to
a
degree
that
only
a
woman
can
attain
but
i
believe
she
would
have
done
murder
in
cold
blood
for
the
sake
of
her
love
some
few
women
there
are
in
whose
hearts
god
has
placed
so
great
an
ocean
of
love
that
when
it
reaches
its
flood
all
other
attributes
of
heart
and
soul
and
mind
are
ingulfed
in
its
mighty
flow
of
this
rare
class
was
dorothy
god
is
love
says
the
book
the
universe
is
god
says
the
philosopher
therefore
as
the
mathematician
would
say
love
is
the
universe
to
that
proposition
dorothy
was
a
corollary
the
servants
were
standing
about
us
in
the
kitchen
let
us
go
to
the
dining
hall
i
suggested
sir
george
led
the
way
by
the
stone
steps
to
the
screens
and
from
the
screens
to
the
small
banquet
hail
and
i
followed
leading
dorothy
by
the
hand
the
moment
of
respite
from
her
father
furious
attack
gave
her
time
in
which
to
collect
her
scattered
senses
when
we
reached
the
banquet
hall
and
after
i
had
closed
the
door
sir
george
turned
upon
his
daughter
and
with
oath
upon
oath
demanded
to
know
the
name
of
her
lover
dorothy
stood
looking
to
the
floor
and
said
nothing
sir
george
strode
furiously
to
and
fro
across
the
room
curse
the
day
you
were
born
you
wanton
huzzy
curse
you
curse
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
wrote
this
letter
he
cried
holding
toward
her
the
fragment
of
paper
tell
me
his
name
or
i
swear
it
before
god
i
swear
it
upon
my
knighthood
i
will
have
you
flogged
in
the
upper
court
till
you
bleed
i
would
do
it
if
you
were
fifty
times
my
child
then
dorothy
awakened
the
girl
was
herself
again
now
it
was
only
for
herself
she
had
to
fear
her
heart
kept
saying
this
for
his
sake
this
for
his
sake
out
of
her
love
came
fortitude
and
out
of
her
fortitude
came
action
her
father
oath
had
hardly
been
spoken
till
the
girl
tore
her
bodice
from
her
shoulders
she
threw
the
garment
to
the
floor
and
said
i
am
ready
for
the
whip
i
am
ready
who
is
to
do
the
deed
father
you
or
the
butcher
it
must
be
done
you
have
sworn
it
and
i
swear
before
god
and
by
my
maidenhood
that
i
will
not
tell
you
the
name
of
the
man
who
wrote
the
letter
i
love
him
and
before
i
will
tell
you
his
name
or
forego
his
love
for
me
or
before
i
will
abate
one
jot
or
tittle
of
my
love
for
him
i
will
gladly
die
by
the
whip
in
your
hand
i
am
ready
for
the
whip
father
i
am
ready
let
us
have
it
over
quickly
the
girl
whose
shoulders
were
bare
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
upper
court
but
sir
george
did
not
move
i
was
deeply
affected
by
the
terrible
scene
and
i
determined
to
prevent
the
flogging
if
to
do
so
should
cost
sir
george
life
at
my
hands
i
would
have
killed
him
ere
he
should
have
laid
a
single
lash
of
the
whip
upon
dorothy
back
father
continued
the
terrible
girl
are
you
not
going
to
flog
me
remember
your
oaths
surely
you
would
not
be
forsworn
before
god
and
upon
your
knighthood
a
forsworn
christian
a
forsworn
knight
a
forsworn
vernon
the
lash
father
the
lash
i
am
eager
for
it
sir
george
stood
in
silence
and
dorothy
continued
to
move
toward
the
door
her
face
was
turned
backward
over
her
shoulder
to
her
father
and
she
whispered
the
words
forsworn
forsworn
forsworn
as
she
put
her
hand
on
the
latch
the
piteous
old
man
held
forth
his
arms
toward
her
and
in
a
wail
of
agony
cried
doll
doll
my
daughter
my
child
god
help
me
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
his
great
form
shook
for
a
moment
as
the
tree
trembles
before
the
fall
and
he
fell
prone
to
the
floor
sobbing
forth
the
anguish
of
which
his
soul
was
full
in
an
instant
dorothy
was
by
her
father
side
holding
his
head
upon
her
lap
she
covered
his
face
with
her
kisses
and
while
the
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
she
spoke
incoherent
words
of
love
and
repentance
i
will
tell
you
all
father
i
will
tell
you
all
i
will
give
him
up
i
will
see
him
never
again
i
will
try
not
to
love
him
oh
father
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
will
never
again
deceive
you
so
long
as
i
live
truly
the
fate
of
an
overoath
is
that
it
shall
be
broken
when
one
swears
to
do
too
much
one
performs
too
little
i
helped
sir
george
rise
to
his
feet
dorothy
full
of
tenderness
and
in
tears
tried
to
take
his
hand
but
he
repulsed
her
rudely
and
uttering
terrible
oaths
coupled
with
her
name
quitted
the
room
with
tottering
steps
when
her
father
had
gone
dorothy
stood
in
revery
for
a
little
time
and
then
looking
toward
the
door
through
which
her
father
had
just
passed
she
spoke
as
if
to
herself
he
does
not
know
how
fortunate
but
you
said
you
would
tell
him
i
suggested
you
said
you
would
give
him
up
dorothy
was
in
a
deep
revery
she
took
her
bodice
from
the
floor
and
mechanically
put
it
on
i
know
i
said
i
would
tell
my
father
and
i
offered
to
give
give
him
up
she
replied
but
i
will
do
neither
father
would
not
meet
my
love
with
love
he
would
not
forgive
me
nor
would
he
accept
my
repentance
when
it
was
he
who
should
have
repented
i
was
alarmed
and
grieved
for
sake
when
i
said
that
i
would
tell
him
about
about
john
and
would
give
him
up
she
was
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
little
time
give
him
up
she
cried
defiantly
no
not
for
my
soul
not
for
ten
thousand
thousand
souls
when
my
father
refused
my
love
he
threw
away
the
only
opportunity
he
shall
ever
have
to
learn
from
me
john
name
that
i
swear
and
i
shall
never
be
forsworn
i
asked
father
forgiveness
when
he
should
have
begged
for
mine
whip
me
in
the
courtyard
would
he
till
i
should
bleed
yet
i
was
willing
to
forgive
him
and
he
would
not
accept
my
forgiveness
i
was
willing
to
forego
john
who
is
more
than
life
to
me
but
my
father
would
not
accept
my
sacrifice
truly
will
i
never
be
so
great
a
fool
the
second
time
malcolm
i
will
not
remain
here
to
be
the
victim
of
another
insult
such
as
my
father
put
upon
me
there
is
no
law
human
or
divine
that
gives
to
a
parent
the
right
to
treat
his
daughter
as
my
father
has
used
me
before
this
day
my
conscience
smote
me
when
i
deceived
him
and
i
suffered
pain
if
i
but
thought
of
my
father
but
now
thanks
to
his
cruelty
i
may
be
happy
without
remorse
malcolm
if
you
betray
me
i
will
i
will
kill
you
if
i
must
follow
you
over
the
world
to
do
it
do
you
think
that
i
deserve
that
threat
from
you
dorothy
i
asked
no
no
my
dear
friend
forgive
me
i
trust
you
and
she
caught
up
my
hand
and
kissed
it
gently
dorothy
and
i
remained
in
the
banquet
hail
seated
upon
the
stone
bench
under
the
blazoned
window
soon
sir
george
returned
closely
followed
by
two
men
one
of
whom
bore
manacles
such
as
were
used
to
secure
prisoners
in
the
dungeon
sir
george
did
not
speak
he
turned
to
the
men
and
motioned
with
his
hand
toward
dorothy
i
sprang
to
my
feet
intending
to
interfere
by
force
if
need
be
to
prevent
the
outrage
but
before
i
could
speak
lady
crawford
hurriedly
entered
the
hall
and
ran
to
sir
george
side
brother
she
said
old
bess
has
just
told
me
that
you
have
given
orders
for
dorothy
confinement
in
the
dungeon
i
could
not
believe
bess
but
these
men
with
irons
lead
me
to
suspect
that
you
really
do
not
interfere
in
affairs
that
do
not
concern
you
replied
sir
george
sullenly
but
this
does
concern
me
greatly
said
aunt
dorothy
and
if
you
send
doll
to
the
dungeon
madge
and
i
will
leave
your
house
and
will
proclaim
your
act
to
all
england
the
girl
has
disobeyed
me
and
has
lied
to
me
and
i
care
not
what
she
has
done
i
shall
leave
your
house
and
disown
you
for
my
brother
if
you
perpetrate
this
outrage
upon
my
niece
she
is
dear
to
me
as
if
she
were
my
own
child
have
i
not
brought
her
up
since
babyhood
if
you
carry
out
this
order
brother
i
will
leave
haddon
hall
forever
and
i
go
with
her
cried
old
bess
who
stood
at
the
door
of
the
screens
and
i
too
said
dawson
who
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
entered
with
sir
george
and
i
cried
the
other
man
throwing
the
manacles
to
the
floor
i
will
leave
your
service
sir
george
took
up
the
manacles
and
moved
toward
dorothy
you
may
all
go
every
cursed
one
of
you
i
rule
my
own
house
and
i
will
have
no
rebels
in
it
when
i
have
finished
with
this
perverse
wench
not
wait
for
you
to
go
i
drive
you
all
out
and
you
may
go
to
he
was
approaching
dorothy
but
i
stepped
in
front
of
him
this
must
not
be
sir
george
said
i
sternly
i
shall
not
leave
haddon
hall
and
i
fear
you
not
i
shall
remain
here
to
protect
your
daughter
and
you
from
your
own
violence
you
can
not
put
me
out
of
haddon
hall
i
will
not
go
why
can
not
i
put
you
out
of
haddon
hail
retorted
sir
george
whose
rage
by
that
time
was
frightful
to
behold
because
sir
i
am
a
better
man
and
a
better
swordsman
than
you
are
and
because
you
have
not
on
all
your
estates
a
servant
nor
a
retainer
who
will
not
join
me
against
you
when
i
tell
them
the
cause
i
champion
dawson
and
his
fellow
stepped
to
my
side
significantly
and
sir
george
raised
the
iron
manacles
as
if
intending
to
strike
me
i
did
not
move
at
the
same
moment
madge
entered
the
room
where
is
my
uncle
she
asked
old
bess
led
her
to
sir
george
she
spoke
not
a
word
but
placed
her
arms
gently
about
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
down
to
hers
then
she
kissed
him
softly
upon
the
lips
and
said
my
uncle
has
never
in
all
his
life
spoken
in
aught
but
kindness
to
me
and
now
i
beg
him
to
be
kind
to
dorothy
the
heavy
manacles
fell
clanking
to
the
floor
sir
george
placed
his
hand
caressingly
upon
madge
head
and
turned
from
dorothy
illustration
lady
crawford
then
approached
her
brother
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
saying
come
with
me
george
that
i
may
speak
to
you
in
private
she
moved
toward
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
and
madge
quietly
took
her
uncle
hand
and
led
him
after
lady
crawford
within
five
minutes
sir
george
aunt
dorothy
and
madge
returned
to
the
room
dorothy
said
madge
in
a
low
voice
here
i
am
madge
murmured
dorothy
who
was
sitting
on
the
bench
by
the
blazoned
window
madge
walked
gropingly
over
to
her
cousin
and
sat
by
her
side
taking
her
hand
then
lady
crawford
spoke
to
dorothy
your
father
wishes
me
to
say
that
you
must
go
to
your
apartments
in
entrance
tower
and
that
you
shall
not
leave
them
without
his
consent
he
also
insists
that
i
say
to
you
if
you
make
resistance
or
objection
to
this
decree
or
if
you
attempt
to
escape
he
will
cause
you
to
be
manacled
and
confined
in
the
dungeon
and
that
no
persuasion
upon
our
part
will
lead
him
from
his
purpose
which
shall
it
be
asked
sir
george
directing
his
question
to
lady
crawford
dorothy
lifted
her
eyebrows
bit
the
corner
of
her
lip
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
indeed
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
where
you
send
me
father
i
am
willing
to
do
whatever
will
give
you
the
greatest
happiness
if
you

my
wishes
you
will
have
me
whipped
in
the
courtyard
till
i
bleed
i
should
enjoy
that
more
than
anything
else

can
do
ah
how
tender
is
the
love
of
a
father

passeth

to
your
apartments
dorothy
said
lady
crawford
anxious
to
separate
the
belligerents
i
have
given
your

answered
sir
george
and
let
me
never
see
but
sir
george
did
not
finish
the
sentence
he
hurriedly
left
the
hall
and
dorothy
cheerfully
went
to
imprisonment
in
entrance
tower
chapter
viii
malcolm
no
sir
george
had
done
a
bad
day
work
he
had
hardened
dorothy
heart
against
himself
and
had
made
it
more
tender
toward
john
since
her
father
had
treated
her
so
cruelly
she
felt
she
was
at
liberty
to
give
her
heart
to
john
without
stint
so
when
once
she
was
alone
in
her
room
the
of
her
heart
were
opened
and
she
poured
forth
the
ineffable
tenderness
and
the
passionate
longings
with
which
she
was
filled
with
solitude
came
the
memory
of
john
words
and
john
kisses
she
recalled
every
movement
every
word
every
tone
every
sensation
she
gave
her
soul
unbridled
license
to
feast
with
joyous
ecstasy
upon
the
thrilling
memories
all
thoughts
of
her
father
cruelty
were
drowned
in
a
sea
of
bliss
she
forgot
him
in
truth
she
forgot
everything
but
her
love
and
her
lover
that
evening
after
she
had
assisted
madge
to
prepare
for
bed
as
was
her
custom
dorothy
stood
before
her
mirror
making
her
toilet
for
the
night
in
the
flood
of
her
newly
found
ecstasy
she
soon
forgot
that
madge
was
in
the
room
dorothy
stood
before
her
mirror
with
her
face
near
to
its
polished
surface
that
she
might
scrutinize
every
feature
and
if
possible
verify
john
words
he
called
me
beauty
twice
she
thought
and
aphrodite
once
then
her
thoughts
grew
into
unconscious
words
and
she
spoke
aloud
i
wish
he
could
see
me
now
and
she
blushed
at
the
thought
as
she
should
have
done
he
acted
as
if
he
meant
all
he
said
she
thought
i
know
he
meant
it
i
trust
him
entirely
but
if
he
should
change
holy
mother
i
believe
i
should
die
but
i
do
believe
him
he
would
not
lie
even
though
he
is
not
a
vernon
with
thoughts
of
the
scene
between
herself
and
her
father
at
the
gate
there
came
a
low
laugh
half
of
amusement
half
of
contentment
and
the
laugh
meant
a
great
deal
that
was
to
be
regretted
it
showed
a
sad
change
in
dorothy
heart
but
yesterday
the
memory
of
her
deceit
would
have
filled
her
with
grief
she
laughed
at
it
ah
sir
george
pitiable
old
man
while
your
daughter
laughs
you
sigh
and
groan
and
moan
and
your
heart
aches
with
pain
and
impotent
rage
even
drink
fails
to
bring
comfort
to
you
i
say
impotent
rage
because
dorothy
is
out
of
your
reach
and
as
surely
as
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
she
is
lost
to
you
forever
the
years
of
protection
and
tender
love
which
you
have
given
to
her
go
for
nothing
now
comes
the
son
of
your
mortal
enemy
and
you
are
but
an
obstruction
in
her
path
your
existence
is
forgotten
while
she
revels
in
the
memory
of
his
words
his
embraces
and
his
lips
she
laughs
while
you
suffer
in
obedience
to
the
fate
that
heaven
has
decreed
for
those
who
bring
children
into
this
world
who
is
to
blame
for
the
pitiable
mite
which
children
give
in
return
for
a
parent
flood
of
love
i
do
not
know
but
of
this
i
am
sure
if
parents
would
cease
to
feel
that
they
own
their
children
in
common
with
their
horses
their
estates
and
their
cattle
if
they
would
not
as
many
do
in
varying
degrees
treat
their
children
as
their
property
the
return
of
love
would
be
far
more
adequate
than
it
is
dorothy
stood
before
her
mirror
plaiting
her
hair
her
head
was
turned
backward
a
little
to
one
side
that
she
might
more
easily
reach
the
great
red
golden
skein
in
that
entrancing
attitude
the
reflection
of
the
nether
lip
of
which
john
had
spoken
so
fondly
came
distinctly
to
notice
she
paused
in
the
braiding
of
her
hair
and
held
her
face
close
to
the
mirror
that
she
might
inspect
the
lip
whose
beauty
john
had
so
ardently
admired
she
turned
her
face
from
one
side
to
the
other
that
she
might
view
it
from
all
points
and
then
she
thrust
it
forward
with
a
pouting
movement
that
would
have
set
the
soul
of
a
mummy
pulsing
if
he
had
ever
been
a
man
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
contemplation
of
the
full
red
lip
and
then
resting
her
hands
upon
the
top
of
the
mirror
table
leaned
forward
and
kissed
its
reflected
image
again
forgetfulness
fell
upon
her
and
her
thoughts
grew
into
words
he
was
surely
right
concerning
my
lower
lip
she
said
speaking
to
herself
then
without
the
least
apparent
relevance
he
had
been
smoking
again
her
words
broke
her
revery
and
she
took
up
the
unfinished
braid
of
hair
when
she
did
so
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
arm
which
was
as
perfectly
rounded
as
the
fairest
marble
of
phidias
she
stretched
the
arm
to
its
full
length
that
the
mirror
might
reflect
its
entire
beauty
again
she
thought
aloud
i
wish
he
could
see
my
arm
perhaps
some
day
but
the
words
ceased
and
in
their
place
came
a
flush
that
spread
from
her
hair
to
her
full
white
throat
and
she
quickly
turned
the
mirror
away
so
that
even
it
should
not
behold
her
beauty
you
see
after
all
is
told
dorothy
was
modest
she
finished
her
toilet
without
the
aid
of
her
mirror
but
before
she
extinguished
the
candle
she
stole
one
more
fleeting
glance
at
its
polished
surface
and
again
came
the
thought
perhaps
some
day
then
she
covered
the
candle
and
amid
enfolding
darkness
lay
down
beside
madge
full
of
thoughts
and
sensations
that
made
her
tremble
for
they
were
strange
to
her
and
she
knew
not
what
they
meant
dorothy
thought
that
madge
was
asleep
but
after
a
few
minutes
the
latter
said
tell
me
dorothy
who
was
on
fire
who
was
on
fire
asked
dorothy
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
madge
i
hope
they
have
not
been
trying
to
burn
any
one
said
madge
what
do
you
mean
again
asked
dorothy
you
said
had
been
smoking
responded
madge
oh
laughed
dorothy
that
is
too
comical
of
course
not
dear
one
i
was
speaking
of
of
a
man
who
had
been
smoking
tobacco
as
malcolm
does
then
she
explained
the
process
of
tobacco
smoking
yes
i
know
answered
madge
i
saw
malcolm
pipe
that
is
i
held
it
in
my
hands
for
a
moment
while
he
explained
to
me
its
use
silence
ensued
for
a
moment
and
madge
again
spoke
what
was
it
he
said
about
your
lower
lip
and
who
was
he
i
did
not
learn
why
uncle
george
wished
to
confine
you
in
the
dungeon
i
am
so
sorry
that
this
trouble
has
come
upon
you
trouble
madge
returned
dorothy
truly
you
do
not
understand
no
trouble
has
come
upon
me
the
greatest
happiness
of
my
life
has
come
to
pass
do
pity
me
envy
me
my
happiness
is
so
sweet
and
so
great
that
it
frightens
me
how
can
you
be
happy
while
your
father
treats
you
so
cruelly
asked
madge
his
conduct
makes
it
possible
for
my
happiness
to
be
complete
returned
dorothy
if
he
were
kind
to
me
i
should
be
unhappy
but
his
cruelty
leaves
me
free
to
be
as
happy
as
i
may
for
my
imprisonment
in
this
room
i
care
not
a
farthing
it
does
not
trouble
me
for
when
i
wish
to
see
see
him
again
i
shall
do
so
i
do
know
at
this
time
just
how
i
shall
effect
it
but
be
sure
sweet
one
i
shall
find
a
way
there
was
no
doubt
in
madge
mind
that
dorothy
would
find
a
way
who
is
he
dorothy
you
may
trust
me
is
he
the
gentleman
whom
we
met
at
yes
answered
dorothy
he
is
sir
john
manners
dorothy
exclaimed
madge
in
tones
of
fear
it
could
not
be
worse
could
it
madge
said
dorothy
oh
dorothy
was
the
only
response
you
will
not
betray
me
asked
dorothy
whose
alarm
made
her
suspicious
you
know
whether
or
not
i
will
betray
you
answered
madge
indeed
i
know
else
i
should
not
have
told
you
my
secret
oh
you
should
see
him
madge
he
is
the
most
beautiful
person
living
the
poor
soft
beauty
of
the
fairest
woman
grows
pale
beside
him
you
can
not
know
how
wonderfully
beautiful
a
man
may
be
you
have
never
seen
one
yes
i
have
seen
many
men
and
i
well
remember
their
appearance
i
was
twelve
years
old
you
know
when
i
lost
my
sight
but
madge
said
dorothy
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
newly
acquired
knowledge
a
girl
of
twelve
can
not
see
a
man
no
woman
sees
with
her
eyes
the
man
whom
she
loves
answered
madge
quietly
how
does
she
see
him
queried
dorothy
with
her
heart
have
you
too
learned
that
fact
asked
dorothy
madge
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
murmured
yes
who
is
he
dear
one
whispered
dorothy
i
may
not
tell
even
you
dorothy
replied
madge
because
it
can
come
to
nothing
the
love
is
all
on
my
part
dorothy
insisted
but
madge
begged
her
not
to
ask
for
her
secret
please
do
even
make
a
guess
concerning
him
said
madge
it
is
my
shame
and
my
joy
it
looked
as
if
this
malady
which
had
fallen
upon
dorothy
were
like
the
plague
that
infects
a
whole
family
if
one
but
catch
it
dorothy
though
curious
was
generous
and
remained
content
with
promise
that
she
should
be
the
first
one
to
hear
the
sweet
story
if
ever
the
time
should
come
to
tell
it
when
did
you
see
him
asked
madge
who
was
more
willing
to
receive
than
to
impart
intelligence
concerning
affairs
of
the
heart
answered
dorothy
then
she
told
madge
about
the
scenes
at
the
gate
and
described
what
had
happened
between
her
and
sir
george
in
the
kitchen
and
banquet
hall
how
could
you
tell
your
father
such
a
falsehood
asked
madge
in
consternation
it
was
very
easy
you
see
i
had
to
do
it
i
never
lied
until
recently
but
oh
madge
this
is
a
terrible
thing
to
come
upon
a
girl
this
was
somewhat
indefinite
but
madge
understood
and
perhaps
it
will
be
clear
to
you
what
dorothy
meant
the
girl
continued
she
forgets
all
else
it
will
drive
her
to
do
anything
however
wicked
for
some
strange
cause
under
its
influence
she
does
not
feel
the
wrong
she
does
it
acts
upon
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
as
poppy
juice
acts
on
pain
before
it
came
upon
me
in
in
such
terrible
force
i
believe
i
should
have
become
ill
had
i
told
my
father
a
falsehood
i
might
have
equivocated
or
i
might
have
evaded
the
truth
in
some
slight
degree
but
i
could
not
have
told
a
lie
but
now
it
is
as
easy
as
winking
and
i
fear
dorothy
responded
madge
that
winking
is
very
easy
for
you
yes
answered
candid
dorothy
with
a
sigh
it
must
be
a
very
great
evil
said
madge
deploringly
one
might
well
believe
so
answered
dorothy
but
it
is
not
one
instinctively
knows
it
to
be
the
essence
of
all
that
is
good
madge
asked
did
sir
john
tell
you
that
that
he
yes
said
dorothy
covering
her
face
even
from
the
flickering
rays
of
the
rushlight
did
you
tell
him
yes
came
in
reply
from
under
the
coverlet
after
a
short
silence
dorothy
uncovered
her
face
yes
she
said
boldly
i
told
him
plainly
nor
did
i
feel
shame
in
so
doing
it
must
be
that
this
strange
love
makes
one
brazen
you
madge
would
die
with
shame
had
you
sought
any
man
as
i
have
sought
john
i
would
not
for
worlds
tell
you
how
bold
and
i
have
been
oh
dorothy
was
all
the
answer
madge
gave
you
would
say
dorothy
many
times
if
you
knew
all
another
pause
ensued
after
which
madge
asked
how
did
you
know
he
had
been
smoking
i
i
tasted
it
responded
dorothy
how
could
you
taste
it
i
hope
you
did
not
smoke
returned
madge
in
wonderment
dorothy
smothered
a
little
laugh
made
two
or
three
vain
attempts
to
explain
tenderly
put
her
arms
about
madge
neck
and
kissed
her
oh
dorothy
that
certainly
was
wrong
returned
madge
although
she
had
some
doubts
in
her
own
mind
upon
the
point
well
if
it
is
wrong
answered
dorothy
sighing
i
do
care
to
live
dorothy
i
fear
you
are
an
immodest
girl
said
madge
i
fear
i
am
but
i
do
care
john
john
john
how
came
he
to
speak
of
your
lower
lip
asked
madge
it
certainly
is
very
beautiful
but
how
came
he
to
speak
of
it
it
was
after
after
once
responded
dorothy
and
your
arm
continued
remorseless
madge
how
came
he
to
speak
of
it
you
surely
did
not
no
no
madge
i
hope
you
do
not
think
i
would
show
him
my
arm
i
have
not
come
to
that
i
have
a
poor
remnant
of
modesty
left
but
the
holy
mother
only
knows
how
long
it
will
last
no
he
did
not
speak
of
my
arm
you
spoke
of
your
arm
when
you
were
before
the
mirror
responded
madge
and
you
said
some
day
oh
do
madge
please
spare
me
i
indeed
fear
i
am
very
wicked
i
will
say
a
little
prayer
to
the
virgin
she
will
hear
me
even
if
i
am
wicked
and
she
will
help
me
to
become
good
and
modest
again
the
girls
went
to
sleep
and
dorothy
dreamed
john
john
john
and
slumbered
happily
that
part
of
the
building
of
haddon
hall
which
lies
to
the
northward
west
of
the
kitchen
consists
of
rooms
according
to
the
following
plan
the
two
rooms
in
entrance
tower
over
the
great
doors
at
the
northwest
corner
of
haddon
hall
were
occupied
by
dorothy
and
madge
the
west
room
overlooking
the
wye
was
their
parlor
the
next
room
to
the
east
was
their
bedroom
the
room
next
their
bedroom
was
occupied
by
lady
crawford
beyond
that
was
sir
george
bedroom
and
east
of
his
room
was
one
occupied
by
the
pages
and
two
retainers
to
enter
dorothy
apartments
one
must
pass
through
all
the
other
rooms
i
have
mentioned
her
windows
were
feet
from
the
ground
and
were
barred
with
iron
after
dorothy
sentence
of
imprisonment
lady
crawford
or
some
trusted
person
in
her
place
was
always
on
guard
in
aunt
dorothy
room
to
prevent
dorothy
escape
and
guards
were
also
stationed
in
the
retainer
room
for
the
same
purpose
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
understand
the
difficulties
dorothy
would
have
to
overcome
before
she
could
see
john
as
she
declared
to
madge
she
would
but
my
opinion
is
that
there
are
no
limits
to
the
resources
of
a
wilful
girl
dorothy
saw
manners
the
plan
she
conceived
to
bring
about
the
desired
end
was
so
seemingly
impossible
and
her
execution
of
it
was
so
adroit
and
daring
that
i
believe
it
will
of
itself
interest
you
in
the
telling
aside
from
the
bearing
it
has
upon
this
history
no
sane
man
would
have
deemed
it
possible
but
this
wilful
girl
carried
it
to
fruition
she
saw
no
chance
of
failure
to
her
it
seemed
a
simple
easy
matter
therefore
she
said
with
confidence
and
truth
i
will
see
him
when
i
wish
to
let
me
tell
you
of
it
during
dorothy
imprisonment
i
spent
an
hour
or
two
each
evening
with
her
and
madge
at
their
parlor
in
the
tower
the
windows
of
the
room
as
i
have
told
you
faced
westward
overlooking
the
wye
and
disclosed
the
beautiful
undulating
scenery
of
overhaddon
hill
in
the
distance
one
afternoon
when
madge
was
not
present
dorothy
asked
me
to
bring
her
a
complete
suit
of
my
garments
boots
hose
trunks
waistcoat
and
doublet
i
laughed
and
asked
her
what
she
wanted
with
them
but
she
refused
to
tell
me
she
insisted
however
and
i
promised
to
fetch
the
garments
to
her
accordingly
the
next
evening
i
delivered
the
bundle
to
her
hands
within
a
week
she
returned
them
all
saving
the
boots
those
she
kept
for
what
reason
i
could
not
guess
lady
crawford
by
command
of
sir
george
carried
in
her
reticule
the
key
of
the
door
which
opened
from
her
own
room
into
sir
george
apartments
and
the
door
was
always
kept
locked
dorothy
had
made
several
attempts
to
obtain
possession
of
the
key
with
intent
i
believe
of
making
a
bold
dash
for
liberty
but
aunt
dorothy
mindful
of
sir
george
wrath
and
fearing
him
above
all
men
acted
faithfully
her
part
of
gaoler
she
smiled
half
in
sadness
when
she
told
me
of
the
girl
simplicity
in
thinking
she
could
hoodwink
a
person
of
lady
crawford
age
experience
and
wisdom
the
old
lady
took
great
pride
in
her
own
acuteness
the
distasteful
task
of
gaoler
however
pained
good
aunt
dorothy
whose
simplicity
was
in
truth
no
match
for
cunning
but
aunt
dorothy
sense
of
duty
and
her
fear
of
sir
george
impelled
her
to
keep
good
and
conscientious
guard
one
afternoon
near
the
hour
of
sunset
i
knocked
for
admission
at
lady
crawford
door
when
i
had
entered
she
locked
the
door
carefully
after
me
and
replaced
the
key
in
the
reticule
which
hung
at
her
girdle
i
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
ladyship
and
entered
dorothy
bedroom
where
i
left
my
cloak
hat
and
sword
the
girls
were
in
the
parlor
when
i
left
lady
crawford
she
again
took
her
chair
near
the
candle
put
on
her
great
spectacles
and
was
soon
lost
to
the
world
in
the
pages
of
sir
philip
de
comynges
the
dear
old
lady
was
and
was
slightly
deaf
dorothy
bedroom
like
lady
crawford
apartments
was
in
deep
shadow
in
it
there
was
no
candle
my
two
fair
friends
were
seated
in
one
of
the
west
windows
watching
the
sunset
they
rose
and
each
gave
me
her
hand
and
welcomed
me
with
the
rare
smiles
i
had
learned
to
expect
from
them
i
drew
a
chair
near
to
the
window
and
we
talked
and
laughed
together
merrily
for
a
few
minutes
after
a
little
time
dorothy
excused
herself
saying
that
she
would
leave
madge
and
me
while
she
went
into
the
bedroom
to
make
a
change
in
her
apparel
madge
and
i
sat
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
window
and
i
said
you
have
not
been
out
for
exercise
i
had
ridden
to
derby
with
sir
george
and
had
gone
directly
on
my
return
to
see
my
two
young
friends
sir
george
had
not
returned
will
you
walk
with
me
about
the
room
i
asked
my
real
reason
for
making
the
suggestion
was
that
i
longed
to
clasp
her
hand
and
to
feel
its
velvety
touch
since
i
should
lead
her
if
we
walked
she
quickly
rose
in
answer
to
my
invitation
and
offered
me
her
hand
as
we
walked
to
and
fro
a
deep
sweet
contentment
filled
my
heart
and
i
felt
that
any
words
my
lips
could
coin
would
but
mar
the
ineffable
silence
never
shall
i
forget
the
soft
light
of
that
gloaming
as
the
darkening
red
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
shot
through
the
panelled
window
across
the
floor
and
illumined
the
tapestry
upon
the
opposite
wall
the
tapestries
of
haddon
hall
are
among
the
most
beautiful
in
england
and
the
picture
upon
which
the
sun
rays
fell
was
that
of
a
lover
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
his
mistress
madge
and
i
passed
and
repassed
the
illumined
scene
and
while
it
was
softly
fading
into
shadow
a
great
flood
of
tender
love
for
the
girl
whose
soft
hand
i
held
swept
over
my
heart
it
was
the
noblest
motive
i
had
ever
felt
moved
by
an
impulse
i
could
not
resist
i
stopped
in
our
walk
and
falling
to
my
knee
pressed
her
hand
ardently
to
my
lips
madge
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
nor
did
she
attempt
to
raise
me
she
stood
in
passive
silence
the
sun
rays
had
risen
as
the
sun
had
sunk
and
the
light
was
falling
like
a
holy
radiance
from
the
gates
of
paradise
upon
the
girl
head
i
looked
upward
and
never
in
my
eyes
had
woman
face
appeared
so
fair
and
saintlike
she
seemed
to
see
me
and
to
feel
the
silent
outpouring
of
my
affection
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
clasping
both
her
hands
spoke
only
her
name
madge
she
answered
simply
malcolm
is
it
possible
and
her
face
illumined
by
the
sunlight
and
by
the
told
me
all
else
then
i
gently
took
her
to
my
arms
and
kissed
her
lips
again
and
again
and
again
and
madge
by
no
sign
nor
gesture
said
me
nay
she
breathed
a
happy
sigh
her
head
fell
upon
my
breast
and
all
else
of
good
that
the
world
could
offer
compared
with
her
was
dross
to
me
we
again
took
our
places
by
the
window
since
now
i
might
hold
her
hand
without
an
excuse
by
the
window
we
sat
speaking
little
through
the
happiest
hour
of
my
i
life
how
dearly
do
i
love
to
write
about
it
and
to
lave
my
soul
in
the
sweet
aromatic
essence
of
its
memory
but
my
rhapsodies
must
have
an
end
when
dorothy
left
me
with
madge
at
the
window
she
entered
her
bedroom
and
quickly
arrayed
herself
in
garments
which
were
facsimiles
of
those
i
had
lent
her
then
she
put
her
feet
into
my
boots
and
donned
my
hat
and
cloak
she
drew
my
gauntleted
gloves
over
her
hands
buckled
my
sword
to
her
slim
waist
pulled
down
the
broad
rim
of
my
soft
beaver
hat
over
her
face
and
turned
up
the
collar
of
my
cloak
then
she
adjusted
about
her
chin
and
upper
lip
a
black
chin
beard
and
moustachio
which
she
had
in
some
manner
contrived
to
make
and
in
short
prepared
to
enact
the
role
of
malcolm
vernon
before
her
watchful
gaoler
aunt
dorothy
while
sitting
silently
with
madge
i
heard
the
clanking
of
my
sword
against
the
oak
floor
in
dorothy
bedroom
i
supposed
she
had
been
toying
with
it
and
had
let
it
fall
she
was
much
of
a
child
and
nothing
could
escape
her
curiosity
then
i
heard
the
door
open
into
aunt
dorothy
apartments
i
whispered
to
madge
requesting
her
to
remain
silently
by
the
window
and
then
i
stepped
softly
over
to
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
i
noiselessly
opened
the
door
and
entered
from
my
dark
in
dorothy
bedroom
i
witnessed
a
scene
in
aunt
dorothy
room
which
filled
me
with
wonder
and
suppressed
laughter
striding
about
in
the
portions
of
lady
crawford
apartment
was
my
other
self
malcolm
no
created
from
the
flesh
and
substance
of
dorothy
vernon
the
sunlight
was
yet
abroad
though
into
lady
crawford
room
its
slanting
rays
but
dimly
entered
at
that
hour
and
the
apartment
was
in
deep
shadow
save
for
the
light
of
one
flickering
candle
close
to
the
flame
of
which
the
old
lady
was
holding
the
pages
of
the
book
she
was
laboriously
perusing
the
girl
held
her
hand
over
her
mouth
that
her
voice
might
be
deepened
and
the
swagger
with
which
she
strode
about
the
room
was
the
most
graceful
and
ludicrous
movement
i
ever
beheld
i
wondered
if
she
thought
she
was
imitating
my
walk
and
i
vowed
that
if
her
step
were
a
copy
of
mine
i
would
straightway
amend
my
pace
what
do
you
read
lady
crawford
said
my
cloak
and
hat
in
tones
that
certainly
were
marvellously
good
imitations
of
my
voice
what
do
you
say
malcolm
asked
the
deaf
old
lady
too
gentle
to
show
the
she
felt
because
of
the
interruption
to
her
reading
i
asked
what
do
you
read
repeated
dorothy
the
of
sir
philip
de
comynges
responded
lady
crawford
have
you
read
it
it
is
a
rare
and
interesting
history
ah
indeed
it
is
a
rare
book
a
rare
book
i
have
read
it
many
times
there
was
no
need
for
that
little
fabrication
and
it
nearly
brought
dorothy
into
trouble
what
part
of
the
do
you
best
like
asked
aunt
dorothy
perhaps
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
say
here
was
trouble
already
for
malcolm
no
that
is
hard
for
me
to
say
i
so
well
like
it
all
perhaps
ah
perhaps
i
prefer
the
the
ah
the
middle
portion
ah
you
like
that
part
which
tells
the
story
of
mary
of
burgundy
returned
aunt
dorothy
oh
malcolm
i
know
upon
what
theme
you
are
always
thinking
the
ladies
the
ladies
can
the
fair
lady
crawford
chide
me
for
that
my
second
self
responded
in
a
gallant
style
of
which
i
was
really
proud
she
who
has
caused
so
much
of
that
sort
of
thought
surely
must
know
that
a
gentleman
mind
can
not
be
better
employed
than
malcolm
you
are
incorrigible
but
it
is
well
for
a
gentleman
to
keep
in
practice
in
such
matters
even
though
he
have
but
an
old
lady
to
practise
on
they
like
it
even
if
it
be
only
practice
do
they
said
dorothy
full
of
the
spirit
of
mischief
i
thank
you
for
nothing
sir
malcolm
vernon
retorted
aunt
dorothy
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
surely
do
value
your
practice
as
you
call
it
one
little
farthing
worth
but
malcolm
no
though
mischievously
inclined
was
much
quicker
of
wit
than
malcolm
no
and
she
easily
extricated
herself
i
meant
that
gentlemen
like
it
lady
crawford
oh
replied
lady
crawford
again
taking
up
her
book
i
have
been
reading
sir
philip
account
of
the
death
of
your
fair
mary
of
burgundy
do
you
remember
the
cause
of
her
death
malcolm
no
who
had
read
sir
philip
so
many
times
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
did
not
remember
the
cause
of
mary
death
you
did
not
read
the
book
with
attention
replied
lady
crawford
sir
philip
says
that
mary
of
burgundy
died
from
an
excess
of
modesty
that
disease
will
never
depopulate
england
was
the
answer
that
came
from
my
garments
much
to
my
chagrin
sir
malcolm
exclaimed
the
old
lady
i
never
before
heard
so
ungallant
a
speech
from
your
lips
and
thought
i
she
never
will
hear
its
like
from
me
modesty
continued
lady
crawford
may
not
be
valued
so
highly
by
young
women
nowadays
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
my
youth
but
i
am
sure
it
is
not
interrupted
dorothy
but
continued
lady
crawford
the
young
women
of
england
are
modest
and
seemly
in
their
conduct
and
they
do
not
deserve
to
be
spoken
of
in
ungallant
jest
i
trembled
lest
dorothy
should
ruin
my
reputation
for
gallantry
do
you
not
said
lady
crawford
consider
dorothy
and
madge
to
be
modest
maidens
madge
ah
surely
she
is
all
that
a
maiden
should
be
she
is
a
saint
but
as
to
dorothy
well
my
dear
lady
crawford
i
predict
another
end
for
her
than
death
from
modesty
i
thank
heaven
the
disease
in
its
mild
form
does
not
kill
dorothy
has
it
mildly
then
under
her
breath
if
at
all
the
girl
sense
of
humor
had
vanquished
her
caution
and
for
the
moment
it
caused
her
to
forget
even
the
reason
for
her
disguise
you
do
not
speak
fairly
of
your
cousin
dorothy
retorted
lady
crawford
she
is
a
modest
girl
and
i
love
her
deeply
her
father
would
not
agree
with
you
replied
dorothy
perhaps
not
responded
the
aunt
her
father
conduct
causes
me
great
pain
and
grief
it
also
causes
me
pain
said
dorothy
sighing
but
malcolm
continued
the
old
lady
putting
down
her
book
and
turning
with
quickened
interest
toward
my
other
self
who
suppose
you
is
the
man
with
whom
dorothy
has
become
so
strangely
entangled
i
can
not
tell
for
the
life
of
me
answered
malcolm
no
surely
a
modest
girl
would
not
act
as
she
does
surely
a
modest
girl
would
replied
aunt
dorothy
testily
malcolm
you
know
nothing
of
women
spoken
with
truth
thought
i
the
old
lady
continued
modesty
and
love
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
each
other
when
love
comes
in
at
the
door
modesty
flies
out
at
the
window
i
do
pity
my
niece
with
all
my
heart
and
in
good
truth
i
wish
i
could
help
her
though
of
course
i
would
not
have
her
know
my
feeling
i
feign
severity
toward
her
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
that
i
am
greatly
interested
in
her
romance
she
surely
is
deeply
in
love
that
is
a
true
word
aunt
dorothy
said
the
lovelorn
young
woman
i
am
sure
she
is
fathoms
deep
in
love
nothing
said
lady
crawford
but
a
great
passion
would
have
impelled
her
to
act
as
she
did
why
even
mary
of
burgundy
with
all
her
modesty
won
the
husband
she
wanted
ay
and
had
him
at
the
cost
of
half
her
rich
domain
i
wonder
if
dorothy
will
ever
have
the
man
she
wants
said
malcolm
sighing
in
a
manner
entirely
new
to
him
no
answered
the
old
lady
i
fear
there
is
no
hope
for
dorothy
i
wonder
who
he
is
her
father
intends
that
she
shall
soon
marry
lord
stanley
sir
george
told
me
as
much
this
morning
when
he
started
for
to
arrange
for
the
signing
of
the
marriage
contract
within
a
day
or
two
he
had
a
talk
yesterday
with
dorothy
she
i
believe
has
surrendered
to
the
inevitable
and
again
there
is
good
feeling
between
her
and
my
brother
dorothy
tossed
her
head
expressively
it
is
a
good
match
continued
lady
crawford
a
good
match
malcolm
i
pity
dorothy
but
it
is
my
duty
to
guard
her
and
i
shall
do
it
faithfully
my
dear
lady
crawford
said
my
hat
and
cloak
your
words
and
feelings
do
great
credit
to
your
heart
but
have
you
ever
thought
that
your
niece
is
a
very
wilful
girl
and
that
she
is
full
of
disturbing
expedients
now
i
am
willing
to
wager
my
beard
that
she
will
sooner
than
you
suspect
see
her
lover
and
i
am
also
willing
to
lay
a
wager
that
she
will
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
despite
all
the
watchfulness
of
her
father
and
yourself
keep
close
guard
over
her
my
lady
or
she
will
escape
lady
crawford
laughed
she
shall
not
escape
have
no
fear
of
that
malcolm
the
key
to
the
door
is
always
safely
locked
in
my
reticule
no
girl
can
outwit
me
i
am
too
old
to
be
caught
unawares
by
a
mere
child
like
dorothy
it
makes
me
laugh
malcolm
although
i
am
sore
at
heart
for
dorothy
sake
it
makes
me
laugh
with
a
touch
of
tears
when
i
think
of
poor
simple
dorothy
many
little
artifices
to
gain
possession
of
this
key
they
are
amusing
and
pathetic
poor
child
but
i
am
too
old
to
be
duped
by
a
girl
malcolm
i
am
too
old
she
has
no
chance
to
escape
i
said
to
myself
no
one
has
ever
become
too
old
to
be
duped
by
a
girl
who
is
in
love
her
wits
grow
keen
as
the
otter
fur
grows
thick
for
the
winter
need
i
do
not
know
your
niece
plan
but
if
i
mistake
not
aunt
dorothy
you
will
in
one
respect
at
least
soon
be
rejuvenated
i
am
sure
lady
crawford
is
right
in
what
she
says
spoke
my
other
self
and
sir
george
is
fortunate
in
having
for
his
daughter
a
guardian
who
can
not
be
hoodwinked
and
who
is
true
to
a
distasteful
trust
i
would
the
trouble
were
over
and
that
dorothy
were
well
married
so
wish
i
malcolm
with
all
my
heart
replied
aunt
dorothy
after
a
brief
pause
in
the
conversation
malcolm
no
said
i
must
now
take
my
leave
will
you
kindly
unlock
the
door
and
permit
me
to
say
good
night
if
you
must
go
answered
my
lady
glad
enough
to
be
left
alone
with
her
beloved
sir
philip
then
she
unlocked
the
door
keep
good
watch
my
dear
aunt
said
malcolm
i
greatly
fear
that
dorothy
but
the
door
closed
on
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
and
on
dorothy
vernon
nonsense
ejaculated
the
old
lady
somewhat
impatiently
why
should
he
fear
for
dorothy
i
hope
i
shall
not
again
be
disturbed
and
soon
she
was
deep
in
the
pages
of
her
book
chapter
ix
a
tryst
at
bowling
green
gate
i
was
at
a
loss
what
course
to
pursue
and
i
remained
for
a
moment
in
puzzling
thought
i
went
back
to
madge
and
after
closing
the
door
told
her
of
all
i
had
seen
she
could
not
advise
me
and
of
course
she
was
deeply
troubled
and
concerned
after
deliberating
i
determined
to
speak
to
aunt
dorothy
that
she
might
know
what
had
happened
so
i
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
lady
crawford
presence
after
viewing
my
back
for
a
short
time
i
said
i
can
not
find
my
hat
cloak
and
sword
i
left
them
in
dorothy
bedroom
has
any
one
been
here
since
i
entered
the
old
lady
turned
quickly
upon
me
since
you
entered
she
cried
in
wonderment
and
consternation
since
you
left
you
mean
did
you
not
leave
this
room
a
few
minutes
ago
what
means
this
how
found
you
entrance
without
the
key
i
did
not
leave
this
room
aunt
dorothy
you
see
i
am
here
i
responded
who
did
leave
your
wraith
some
one
dorothy
screamed
the
old
lady
in
terror
that
girl
holy
virgin
where
is
she
lady
crawford
hastened
to
dorothy
room
and
returned
to
me
in
great
agitation
were
you
in
the
plot
she
demanded
angrily
no
more
than
were
you
lady
crawford
i
replied
telling
the
exact
truth
if
i
were
accessory
to
dorothy
crime
it
was
only
as
a
witness
and
aunt
dorothy
had
seen
as
much
as
i
continued
dorothy
left
lady
madge
and
me
at
the
window
saying
she
wished
to
make
a
change
in
her
garments
i
was
watching
the
sunset
and
talking
with
lady
madge
lady
crawford
being
full
of
concern
about
the
main
event
escape
was
easily
satisfied
that
i
was
not
accessory
before
the
fact
what
shall
i
do
malcolm
what
shall
i
do
help
me
quickly
my
brother
will
return
in
the
morning
perhaps
he
will
return
and
he
will
not
believe
that
i
have
not
intentionally
permitted
dorothy
to
leave
the
hall
i
have
of
late
said
so
much
to
him
on
behalf
of
the
girl
that
he
suspects
me
already
of
being
in
sympathy
with
her
he
will
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
him
that
i
have
been
duped
the
ungrateful
selfish
girl
how
could
she
so
unkindly
return
my
affection
the
old
lady
began
to
weep
i
did
not
believe
that
dorothy
intended
to
leave
haddon
hall
permanently
i
felt
confident
she
had
gone
out
only
to
meet
john
and
was
sure
she
would
soon
return
on
the
strength
of
that
opinion
i
said
if
you
fear
that
sir
george
will
not
believe
you
he
certainly
will
blame
you
would
it
not
be
better
to
admit
dorothy
quietly
when
she
returns
and
say
nothing
to
any
one
concerning
the
escapade
i
will
remain
here
in
these
rooms
and
when
she
returns
i
will
depart
and
the
guards
will
never
suspect
that
dorothy
has
left
the
hall
if
she
will
but
return
wailed
aunt
dorothy
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
admit
her
and
to
keep
silent
i
am
sure
she
will
i
answered
leave
orders
with
the
guard
at
sir
george
door
to
admit
me
at
any
time
during
the
night
and
dorothy
will
come
in
without
being
recognized
her
disguise
must
be
very
complete
if
she
could
deceive
you
indeed
her
disguise
is
complete
replied
the
tearful
old
lady
dorothy
disguise
was
so
complete
and
her
resemblance
to
me
had
been
so
well
contrived
that
she
met
with
no
opposition
from
the
guards
in
the
retainer
room
nor
from
the
porter
she
walked
out
upon
the
terrace
where
she
strolled
for
a
short
time
then
she
climbed
over
the
wall
at
the
stile
back
of
the
terrace
and
took
her
way
up
bowling
green
hill
toward
the
gate
she
sauntered
leisurely
until
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
hall
then
gathering
up
her
cloak
and
sword
she
sped
along
the
steep
path
to
the
hill
crest
and
thence
to
the
gate
soon
after
the
first
day
of
her
imprisonment
she
had
sent
a
letter
to
john
by
the
hand
of
jennie
faxton
acquainting
him
with
the
details
of
all
that
had
happened
in
her
letter
among
much
else
she
said
my
true
love
i
beg
you
to
haunt
with
your
presence
bowling
green
gate
each
day
at
the
hour
of
sunset
i
can
not
tell
you
when
i
shall
be
there
to
meet
you
or
surely
i
would
do
so
now
but
be
there
i
will
let
no
doubt
of
that
disturb
your
mind
it
does
not
lie
in
the
power
of
man
to
keep
me
from
you
that
is
it
lies
in
the
power
of
but
one
man
you
my
love
and
my
lord
and
i
fear
not
that
you
will
use
your
power
to
that
end
so
it
is
that
i
beg
you
to
wait
for
me
at
sunset
hour
each
day
near
by
bowling
green
gate
you
may
be
caused
to
wait
for
me
a
long
weary
time
but
one
day
sooner
or
later
i
shall
go
to
you
and
then
ah
then
if
it
be
in
my
power
to
reward
your
patience
you
shall
have
no
cause
for
complaint
when
dorothy
reached
the
gate
she
found
it
securely
locked
she
peered
eagerly
through
the
bars
hoping
to
see
john
she
tried
to
shake
the
heavy
iron
structure
to
assure
herself
that
it
could
not
be
opened
ah
well
she
sighed
i
suppose
the
reason
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
is
because
he
or
she
can
climb
then
she
climbed
the
gate
and
sprang
to
the
ground
on
the
devonshire
side
of
the
wall
what
will
john
think
when
he
sees
me
in
this
attire
she
said
half
aloud
malcolm
cloak
serves
but
poorly
to
cover
me
and
i
shall
instead
be
covered
with
shame
and
confusion
when
john
comes
i
fear
he
will
think
i
have
disgraced
myself
then
with
a
sigh
but
necessity
knows
no
raiment
she
strode
about
near
the
gate
for
a
few
minutes
wishing
that
she
were
indeed
a
man
save
for
one
fact
if
she
were
not
a
woman
john
would
not
love
her
and
above
all
she
could
not
love
john
the
fact
that
she
could
and
did
love
john
appealed
to
dorothy
as
the
highest
sweetest
privilege
that
heaven
or
earth
could
offer
to
a
human
being
the
sun
had
sunk
in
the
west
and
his
faint
parting
glory
was
but
dimly
to
be
seen
upon
a
few
small
clouds
that
floated
above
overhaddon
hill
the
moon
was
past
its
half
and
the
stars
still
yellow
and
pale
from
the
lingering
glare
of
day
waited
eagerly
to
give
their
twinkling
help
in
lighting
the
night
the
forest
near
the
gate
was
dense
and
withal
the
fading
light
of
the
sun
and
the
dawning
beams
of
the
moon
and
stars
deep
shadow
enveloped
dorothy
and
all
the
scene
about
her
the
girl
was
disappointed
when
she
did
not
see
manners
but
she
was
not
vexed
there
was
but
one
person
in
all
the
world
toward
whom
she
held
a
patient
humble
attitude
john
if
he
in
his
greatness
goodness
and
condescension
deigned
to
come
and
meet
so
poor
a
person
as
dorothy
vernon
she
would
be
thankful
and
happy
if
he
did
not
come
she
would
be
sorrowful
his
will
was
her
will
and
she
would
come
again
and
again
until
she
should
find
him
waiting
for
her
and
he
should
stoop
to
lift
her
into
heaven
if
there
is
a
place
in
all
the
earth
where
red
warm
blood
counts
for
its
full
value
it
is
in
a
pure
woman
veins
through
it
brings
to
her
a
proud
reserve
toward
all
mankind
till
the
right
one
comes
toward
him
it
brings
an
eager
humbleness
that
is
the
essence
and
the
life
of
heaven
and
of
love
poets
may
praise
snowy
women
as
they
will
but
the
compelling
woman
is
she
of
the
warm
blood
the
snowy
woman
is
the
lifeless
seed
the
rainless
cloud
the
unmagnetic
lodestone
the
drossful
iron
the
great
laws
of
nature
affect
her
but
passively
if
there
is
aught
in
the
saying
of
the
ancients
the
best
only
in
nature
can
survive
the
day
of
her
extermination
will
come
fire
is
as
chaste
as
snow
and
infinitely
more
comforting
dorothy
patience
was
not
to
be
tried
for
long
five
minutes
after
she
had
climbed
the
gate
she
beheld
john
riding
toward
her
from
the
direction
of
rowsley
and
her
heart
beat
with
thrill
upon
thrill
of
joy
she
felt
that
the
crowning
moment
of
her
life
was
at
hand
by
the
help
of
a
subtle
sense
familiar
spirit
to
her
love
perhaps
she
knew
that
john
would
ask
her
to
go
with
him
and
to
be
his
wife
despite
all
the
rutlands
and
vernons
dead
living
or
to
be
born
the
thought
of
refusing
him
never
entered
her
mind
queen
nature
was
on
the
throne
in
the
fulness
of
power
and
dorothy
in
perfect
attune
with
her
great
sovereign
was
fulfilling
her
destiny
in
accordance
with
the
laws
to
which
her
drossless
being
was
entirely
amenable
many
times
had
the
fear
come
to
her
that
sir
john
manners
who
was
heir
to
the
great
earldom
of
rutland
he
who
was
so
great
so
good
and
so
beautiful
might
feel
that
his
duty
to
his
house
past
present
and
future
and
the
obligations
of
his
position
among
the
grand
nobles
of
the
realm
should
deter
him
from
a
marriage
against
which
so
many
good
reasons
could
be
urged
but
this
evening
her
familiar
spirit
whispered
to
her
that
she
need
not
fear
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
joy
and
certainty
john
dismounted
and
tethered
his
horse
at
a
short
distance
from
the
gate
he
approached
dorothy
but
halted
when
he
beheld
a
man
instead
of
the
girl
whom
he
longed
to
meet
his
hesitancy
surprised
dorothy
who
in
her
eagerness
had
forgotten
her
male
attire
she
soon
saw
however
that
he
did
not
recognize
her
and
she
determined
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
to
maintain
her
incognito
till
he
should
penetrate
her
disguise
she
turned
her
back
on
john
and
sauntered
leisurely
about
whistling
softly
she
pretended
to
be
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
john
who
felt
that
the
field
was
his
by
the
divine
right
of
love
walked
to
the
gate
and
looked
through
the
bars
toward
bowling
green
he
stood
at
the
gate
for
a
short
time
with
indifference
in
his
manner
and
irritation
in
his
heart
he
too
tried
to
hum
a
tune
but
failed
then
he
tried
to
whistle
but
his
musical
efforts
were
abortive
there
was
no
music
in
him
a
moment
before
his
heart
had
been
full
of
harmony
but
when
he
found
a
man
instead
of
his
sweetheart
the
harmony
quickly
turned
to
rasping
discord
john
was
not
a
patient
man
and
his
impatience
was
apt
to
take
the
form
of
words
and
actions
a
little
aimless
stalking
about
at
the
gate
was
more
than
enough
for
him
so
he
stepped
toward
the
intruder
and
lifted
his
hat
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
thought
when
first
i
saw
you
that
you
were
sir
malcolm
vernon
i
fancied
you
bore
resemblance
to
him
i
see
that
i
was
in
error
yes
in
error
answered
my
beard
again
the
two
gentlemen
walked
around
each
other
with
great
amusement
on
the
part
of
one
and
with
ever
increasing
vexation
on
the
part
of
the
other
soon
john
said
may
i
ask
whom
have
i
the
honor
to
address
certainly
you
may
ask
was
the
response
a
silence
ensued
during
which
dorothy
again
turned
her
back
on
john
and
walked
a
few
paces
away
from
him
john
patience
was
rapidly
oozing
and
when
the
unknown
intruder
again
turned
in
his
direction
john
said
with
all
the
gentleness
then
at
his
command
well
sir
i
do
ask
your
curiosity
is
flattering
said
the
girl
pardon
me
sir
returned
john
my
curiosity
is
not
intended
to
be
flattering
i
i
hope
it
is
not
intended
to
be
insulting
sir
asked
my
hat
and
cloak
that
sir
all
depends
upon
yourself
retorted
john
warmly
then
after
an
instant
of
thought
he
continued
in
tones
of
conciliation
i
have
an
engagement
of
a
private
nature
at
this
place
in
short
i
hope
to
meet
a
a
friend
here
within
a
few
minutes
and
i
feel
sure
that
under
the
circumstances
so
gallant
a
gentleman
as
yourself
will
act
with
due
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
another
i
hope
and
believe
that
you
will
do
as
you
would
be
done
by
certainly
certainly
responded
the
gallant
i
find
no
fault
at
all
with
your
presence
please
take
no
account
whatever
of
me
i
assure
you
i
shall
not
be
in
the
least
disturbed
john
was
somewhat
disconcerted
perhaps
you
will
not
be
disturbed
replied
john
struggling
to
keep
down
his
temper
but
i
fear
you
do
not
understand
me
i
hope
to
meet
a
a
lady
and
i
hope
also
to
meet
a
a
friend
the
fellow
said
but
i
assure
you
we
shall
in
no
way
conflict
may
i
ask
queried
john
if
you
expect
to
meet
a
gentleman
or
a
lady
certainly
you
may
ask
was
the
girl
irritating
reply
well
well
sir
i
do
ask
said
john
furthermore
i
demand
to
know
whom
you
expect
to
meet
at
this
place
that
of
course
sir
is
no
business
of
yours
but
i
shall
make
it
my
affair
i
expect
to
meet
a
lady
here
my
sweetheart
the
girl
heart
jumped
with
joy
and
if
you
have
any
of
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
you
must
know
that
your
presence
will
be
intolerable
to
me
perhaps
it
will
be
my
dear
sir
but
i
have
as
good
a
right
here
as
you
or
any
other
if
you
must
know
all
about
my
affairs
i
tell
you
i
too
hope
to
meet
my
sweetheart
at
this
place
in
fact
i
know
i
shall
meet
my
sweetheart
and
my
good
fellow
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
a
presence
would
be
very
annoying
to
me
john
was
at
his
wit
end
he
must
quickly
do
or
say
something
to
persuade
this
stubborn
fellow
to
leave
if
dorothy
should
come
and
see
two
persons
at
the
gate
she
of
course
would
return
to
the
hall
jennie
faxton
who
knew
that
the
garments
were
finished
had
told
sir
john
that
he
might
reasonably
expect
to
see
dorothy
at
the
gate
on
that
evening
for
sir
george
had
gone
to
presumably
to
remain
over
night
in
sheer
desperation
john
said
i
was
here
first
and
i
claim
the
ground
that
is
not
true
replied
the
other
i
have
been
waiting
here
for
you
i
mean
for
the
person
i
am
to
meet
dorothy
thought
she
had
betrayed
herself
and
that
john
would
surely
recognize
her
i
had
been
waiting
full
five
minutes
before
you
arrived
john
blindness
in
failing
to
recognize
dorothy
is
past
my
understanding
he
explained
it
to
me
afterward
by
saying
that
his
eagerness
to
see
dorothy
and
his
fear
nay
almost
certainty
that
she
could
not
come
coupled
with
the
hope
which
jennie
faxton
had
given
him
had
so
completely
occupied
his
mind
that
other
subjects
received
but
slight
consideration
but
i
i
have
been
here
before
this
night
to
meet
and
i
have
been
here
to
meet
quite
as
often
as
you
i
hope
retorted
dorothy
they
say
that
love
blinds
a
man
it
must
also
have
deafened
john
since
he
did
not
recognize
his
sweetheart
voice
it
may
be
true
that
you
have
been
here
before
this
evening
retorted
john
angrily
but
you
shall
not
remain
here
now
if
you
wish
to
save
yourself
trouble
leave
at
once
if
you
stalk
about
in
the
forest
i
will
run
you
through
and
leave
you
for
the
crows
to
pick
i
have
no
intention
of
leaving
and
if
i
were
to
do
so
you
would
regret
it
by
my
beard
you
would
regret
it
answered
the
girl
pleased
to
see
john
in
his
overbearing
commanding
mood
his
stupidity
was
past
comprehension
defend
yourself
said
john
drawing
his
sword
now
he
will
surely
know
the
truth
thought
dorothy
but
she
said
i
am
much
younger
than
you
and
am
not
so
large
and
strong
i
am
unskilled
in
the
use
of
a
sword
and
therefore
am
i
no
match
for
sir
john
manners
than
whom
i
have
heard
there
is
no
better
swordsman
stronger
arm
nor
braver
heart
in
england
you
flatter
me
my
friend
returned
john
forced
into
a
good
humor
against
his
will
but
you
must
leave
he
who
can
not
defend
himself
must
yield
it
is
the
law
of
nature
and
of
men
john
advanced
toward
dorothy
who
retreated
stepping
backward
holding
her
arm
over
her
face
i
am
ready
to
yield
if
you
wish
in
fact
i
am
eager
to
yield
more
eager
than
you
can
know
she
cried
it
is
well
answered
john
putting
his
sword
in
sheath
but
continued
dorothy
i
will
not
go
away
then
you
must
fight
said
john
i
tell
you
again
i
am
willing
nay
eager
to
yield
to
you
but
i
also
tell
you
i
can
not
fight
in
the
way
you
would
have
me
in
other
ways
perhaps
i
can
fight
quite
as
well
as
anybody
but
really
i
am
ashamed
to
draw
my
sword
since
to
do
so
would
show
you
how
poorly
i
am
equipped
to
defend
myself
under
your
great
laws
of
nature
and
of
man
again
i
wish
to
assure
you
that
i
am
more
than
eager
to
yield
but
i
can
not
fight
you
and
i
will
not
go
away
the
wonder
never
ceases
that
john
did
not
recognize
her
she
took
no
pains
to
hide
her
identity
and
after
a
few
moments
of
concealment
she
was
anxious
that
john
should
discover
her
under
my
garments
i
would
know
his
voice
she
thought
did
he
wear
all
the
petticoats
in
derbyshire
what
shall
i
do
with
you
cried
john
amused
and
irritated
i
can
not
strike
you
no
of
course
you
would
not
murder
me
in
cold
blood
answered
dorothy
laughing
heartily
she
was
sure
her
laughter
would
open
john
eyes
i
can
not
carry
you
away
said
john
i
would
come
back
again
if
you
did
answered
the
irrepressible
fellow
i
suppose
you
would
returned
john
sullenly
in
the
devil
name
tell
me
what
you
will
do
can
i
not
beg
you
to
go
now
sir
john
you
have
touched
me
i
make
you
this
offer
you
expect
mistress
vernon
to
come
from
the
hall
what
do
you
know
about
mistress
vernon
cried
john
by
god
i
will
now
do
grow
angry
sir
john
and
please
do
swear
in
my
presence
you
expect
her
i
say
to
come
from
the
hall
what
i
propose
is
this
you
shall
stand
by
the
gate
and
watch
for
doll
oh
i
mean
mistress
vernon
and
i
will
stand
here
behind
the
wall
where
she
can
not
see
me
when
she
comes
in
sight
though
in
truth
i
do
think
she
will
come
and
i
believe
were
she
under
your
very
nose
you
would
not
see
her
you
shall
tell
me
and
i
will
leave
at
once
that
is
if
you
wish
me
to
leave
after
you
see
dorothy
vernon
if
you
still
wish
me
to
go
i
pledge
my
faith
no
power
can
keep
me
now
is
not
that
fair
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
want
to
remain
here
if
you
will
permit
me
and
talk
to
you
for
a
little
time
till
you
see
doll
vernon
doll
vernon
fellow
how
dare
you
so
speak
of
her
demanded
john
hotly
your
pardon
and
her
pardon
i
beg
mistress
vernon
soon
to
be
countess
of
derbyshire
by
the
way
i
wager
you
a
gold
pound
sterling
that
by
the
time
you
see
doll
vernon
mistress
vernon
i
pray
your
pardon
you
will
have
grown
so
fond
of
me
that
you
will
not
permit
me
to
leave
you
she
thought
after
that
speech
he
could
not
help
but
know
her
but
john
skull
was
like
an
oaken
board
that
night
nothing
could
penetrate
it
he
began
to
fancy
that
his
companion
was
a
simple
witless
person
who
had
escaped
from
his
keepers
will
you
take
the
wager
asked
dorothy
nonsense
was
the
only
reply
john
deigned
to
give
to
so
foolish
a
proposition
then
will
you
agree
that
i
shall
remain
at
the
gate
till
doll
mistress
vernon
comes
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
make
the
best
terms
possible
with
you
he
returned
you
are
an
amusing
fellow
and
as
perverse
as
a
woman
i
knew
you
would
soon
learn
to
like
me
she
responded
the
first
step
toward
a
man
affection
is
to
amuse
him
that
old
saw
which
says
the
road
to
a
man
heart
is
through
his
stomach
is
a
sad
mistake
amusement
is
the
highway
to
a
man
affections
it
is
better
that
one
laugh
with
us
than
at
us
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
two
methods
answered
john
contemptuously
you
dare
to
laugh
at
me
cried
dorothy
grasping
the
hilt
of
her
sword
and
pretending
to
be
angry
john
waved
her
off
with
his
hand
and
laughingly
said
little
you
know
concerning
the
way
to
a
man
heart
and
no
doubt
less
of
the
way
to
a
woman
i
perhaps
know
more
about
it
than
you
would
believe
returned
malcolm
no
if
you
know
aught
of
the
latter
subject
it
is
more
than
i
would
suppose
said
john
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
a
woman
can
love
a
man
who
is
unable
to
defend
himself
a
vain
man
thinks
that
women
care
only
for
men
of
his
own
pattern
retorted
dorothy
women
love
a
strong
arm
it
is
true
but
they
also
love
a
strong
heart
and
you
see
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
you
even
though
you
have
twice
my
strength
there
are
as
many
sorts
of
bravery
sir
john
as
as
there
are
hairs
in
my
beard
that
is
not
many
interrupted
john
and
continued
the
girl
i
believe
john
sir
john
you
possess
all
the
kinds
of
bravery
that
are
good
you
flatter
me
said
john
yes
returned
dorothy
that
was
my
intent
after
that
unflattering
remark
there
came
a
pause
then
the
girl
continued
somewhat
hesitatingly
doubtless
many
women
sir
john
have
seen
your
virtues
more
clearly
than
even
i
see
them
women
have
a
keener
perception
of
masculine
virtues
than
than
we
have
dorothy
paused
and
her
heart
beat
with
a
quickened
throb
while
she
awaited
his
reply
a
new
field
of
discovery
was
opening
up
to
her
and
a
new
use
for
her
disguise
john
made
no
reply
but
the
persistent
girl
pursued
her
new
line
of
attack
illustration
surely
sir
john
manners
has
had
many
sweethearts
said
dorothy
in
flattering
tones
there
were
rocks
and
shoals
ahead
for
john
love
barge
many
many
i
am
sure
the
girl
persisted
ah
a
few
a
few
i
admit
john
like
a
fool
replied
dorothy
was
accumulating
disagreeable
information
rapidly
while
you
were
at
london
court
said
she
the
fine
ladies
must
have
sought
you
in
great
numbers
i
am
sure
they
did
perhaps
oh
perhaps
returned
john
one
can
not
always
remember
such
affairs
his
craft
was
headed
for
the
rocks
had
he
observed
face
he
would
have
seen
the
storm
to
how
many
women
sir
john
have
you
lost
your
heart
and
at
various
times
how
many
have
lost
their
hearts
to
you
asked
the
persistent
what
a
senseless
question
returned
john
a
dozen
times
or
more
perhaps
a
score
or
two
score
times
i
can
not
tell
the
exact
number
i
did
not
keep
an
account
dorothy
did
not
know
whether
she
wanted
to
weep
or
be
angry
pique
and
a
flash
of
temper
however
saved
her
from
tears
and
she
said
you
are
so
brave
and
handsome
that
you
must
have
found
it
a
very
easy
task
much
easier
than
it
would
be
for
me
to
convince
those
confiding
ones
of
your
affection
yes
replied
john
plunging
full
sail
upon
the
breakers
i
admit
that
usually
they
have
been
quite
easy
to
convince
i
am
naturally
bold
and
i
suppose
that
perhaps
that
is
i
may
possibly
have
a
persuasive
trick
about
me
shades
of
good
men
who
have
blundered
into
ruin
over
the
path
of
petty
vanity
save
this
man
but
no
dorothy
must
drink
the
bitter
cup
of
knowledge
to
the
dregs
and
you
have
been
false
to
all
of
these
women
she
said
ah
well
you
know
the
devil
take
it
a
man
ca
be
true
to
a
score
of
women
replied
john
i
am
sure
none
of
them
wished
you
to
be
true
the
girl
answered
restraining
her
tears
with
great
difficulty
at
that
point
in
the
conversation
john
began
to
suspect
from
the
manner
and
shapeliness
of
his
companion
that
a
woman
had
disguised
herself
in
man
attire
yet
it
did
not
once
occur
to
him
that
dorothy
fair
form
was
concealed
within
the
disguise
he
attempted
to
lift
my
soft
beaver
hat
the
broad
rim
of
which
hid
dorothy
face
but
to
that
she
made
a
decided
objection
and
john
continued
by
my
soul
i
believe
you
are
a
woman
your
walk
dorothy
thought
she
had
been
swaggering
like
a
veritable
your
voice
the
curves
of
your
form
all
betray
you
dorothy
gathered
the
cloak
closely
about
her
i
would
know
more
of
you
said
john
and
he
stepped
toward
the
now
interesting
stranger
but
she
drew
away
from
him
and
told
him
to
keep
hands
off
oh
i
am
right
you
are
a
woman
said
john
dorothy
had
maintained
the
disguise
longer
than
she
wished
and
was
willing
that
john
should
discover
her
identity
at
first
it
had
been
rare
sport
to
dupe
him
but
the
latter
part
of
her
conversation
had
given
her
no
pleasure
she
was
angry
jealous
and
hurt
by
what
she
had
learned
yes
she
answered
i
admit
that
i
am
a
a
woman
now
i
must
go
stay
but
one
moment
pleaded
john
whose
curiosity
and
gallantry
were
aroused
i
will
watch
for
mistress
vernon
and
when
she
appears
then
you
may
go
i
told
you
that
you
would
want
me
to
remain
said
the
girl
with
a
sigh
she
was
almost
ready
to
weep
then
she
thought
i
little
dreamed
i
was
coming
here
for
this
i
will
carry
the
disguise
a
little
farther
and
will
perhaps
learn
enough
to
to
break
my
heart
she
was
soon
to
learn
all
she
wanted
to
know
and
a
great
deal
more
come
sit
by
me
on
this
stone
said
john
coaxingly
the
girl
complied
and
drew
the
cloak
over
her
knees
tell
me
why
you
are
here
he
asked
to
meet
a
gentleman
she
replied
with
face
tell
me
your
name
john
asked
as
he
drew
my
glove
from
her
passive
hand
john
held
the
hand
in
his
and
after
examining
it
in
the
dim
light
saw
that
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
good
to
look
upon
then
he
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
said
since
our
sweethearts
have
disappointed
us
may
we
not
console
ourselves
with
each
other
he
placed
his
arm
around
the
girl
waist
and
drew
her
yielding
form
toward
him
dorothy
unobserved
by
john
removed
the
false
beard
and
moustachio
and
when
john
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
leaned
forward
to
kiss
the
fair
accommodating
neighbor
she
could
restrain
her
tears
no
longer
and
said
that
would
be
no
consolation
for
me
john
that
would
be
no
consolation
for
me
how
can
you
how
can
you
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
in
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
john
too
sprang
to
his
feet
you
may
be
sure
dorothy
god
help
me
i
am
the
king
of
fools
curse
this
hour
in
which
i
have
thrown
away
my
heaven
you
must
hate
and
despise
me
fool
fool
that
i
am
john
knew
that
it
were
worse
than
useless
for
him
to
attempt
an
explanation
the
first
thought
that
flashed
through
his
mind
was
to
tell
the
girl
that
he
had
only
pretended
not
to
know
her
he
thought
he
would
try
to
make
her
believe
that
he
had
been
turning
her
trick
upon
herself
but
he
was
wise
in
his
day
and
generation
and
did
not
seek
refuge
in
that
falsehood
the
girl
would
never
have
forgiven
him
for
that
the
only
amends
i
can
make
he
said
in
very
dolefulness
is
that
i
may
never
let
you
see
my
face
again
that
will
not
help
matters
sobbed
dorothy
i
know
it
will
not
returned
john
nothing
can
help
me
i
can
remain
here
no
longer
i
must
leave
you
i
can
not
even
ask
you
to
say
farewell
mistress
vernon
you
do
not
despise
me
half
so
bitterly
as
i
despise
myself
dorothy
was
one
of
those
rare
natures
to
whom
love
comes
but
once
it
had
come
to
her
and
had
engulfed
her
whole
being
to
part
with
it
would
be
like
parting
with
life
itself
it
was
her
tyrant
her
master
it
was
her
ego
she
could
no
more
throw
it
off
than
she
could
expel
herself
from
her
own
existence
all
this
she
knew
full
well
for
she
had
analyzed
her
conditions
and
her
reason
had
joined
with
all
her
other
faculties
in
giving
her
a
clear
concept
of
the
truth
she
knew
she
belonged
to
john
manners
for
life
and
for
eternity
she
also
knew
that
the
chance
of
seeing
him
soon
again
was
very
slight
and
to
part
from
him
now
in
aught
but
kindness
would
almost
kill
her
before
john
had
recognized
dorothy
he
certainly
had
acted
like
a
fool
but
with
the
shock
of
recognition
came
wisdom
all
the
learning
of
the
ancients
and
all
the
cunning
of
the
prince
of
darkness
could
not
have
taught
him
a
wiser
word
with
which
to
make
his
peace
i
may
never
let
you
see
my
face
again
that
was
more
to
be
feared
by
dorothy
than
even
inconstancy
her
heart
was
full
of
trouble
i
do
not
know
what
i
wish
she
said
simply
give
me
a
little
time
to
think
john
heart
leaped
with
joy
but
he
remained
silent
dorothy
continued
oh
that
i
had
remained
at
home
i
would
to
god
i
had
never
seen
nor
you
john
in
the
fulness
of
his
wisdom
did
not
interrupt
her
to
think
that
i
have
thus
made
a
fool
of
myself
about
a
man
who
has
given
his
heart
to
a
score
of
women
this
is
torture
moaned
john
in
real
pain
but
continued
dorothy
i
could
not
remain
away
from
this
place
when
i
had
the
opportunity
to
come
to
you
i
felt
that
i
must
come
i
felt
that
i
should
die
if
i
did
not
and
you
are
so
false
i
wish
i
were
dead
a
moment
ago
had
i
been
another
woman
you
would
have
kissed
her
you
thought
i
was
another
woman
john
wisdom
stood
by
him
nobly
he
knew
he
could
neither
explain
successfully
nor
beg
forgiveness
he
simply
said
i
can
not
remain
and
look
you
in
the
face
if
i
dare
make
any
request
it
is
that
despite
all
you
have
heard
from
my
lips
you
will
still
believe
that
i
love
you
and
that
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
loved
any
one
so
dearly
there
is
no
other
woman
for
me
you
doubtless
spoke
the
same
false
words
to
the
other
two
score
women
said
dorothy
tears
and
sobs
were
playing
sad
havoc
with
her
powers
of
speech
farewell
mistress
vernon
replied
john
i
should
be
shameless
if
i
dared
ask
you
to
believe
any
word
i
can
utter
forget
if
possible
that
i
ever
existed
forget
me
that
you
may
not
despise
me
i
am
unworthy
to
dwell
even
in
the
smallest
of
your
thoughts
i
am
altogether
base
and
contemptible
sighed
dorothy
poutingly
while
she
bent
low
her
head
and
toyed
with
the
gold
lace
of
my
cloak
farewell
said
john
he
took
a
step
or
two
backward
from
her
you
are
to
leave
it
seems
to
me
said
the
girl
in
an
injured
tone
i
wonder
that
you
came
at
all
john
heart
was
singing
hosanna
he
however
maintained
his
voice
at
a
mournful
pitch
and
said
i
must
go
i
can
no
longer
endure
to
remain
while
he
spoke
he
moved
toward
his
horse
and
his
head
was
bowed
with
real
shame
as
he
thought
of
the
pitiable
fool
he
had
made
of
himself
dorothy
saw
him
going
from
her
and
she
called
to
him
softly
and
reluctantly
john
he
did
not
hear
her
or
perhaps
he
thought
best
to
pretend
that
he
did
not
hear
and
as
he
moved
from
her
the
girl
became
desperate
modesty
resentment
insulted
womanhood
and
injured
pride
were
all
swept
away
by
the
stream
of
her
mighty
love
and
she
cried
again
this
time
without
hesitancy
or
reluctance
john
john
she
started
to
run
toward
him
but
my
cloak
was
in
her
way
and
the
sword
tripped
her
feet
in
her
fear
lest
john
might
leave
her
she
unclasped
the
from
her
waist
and
snatched
the
cloak
from
her
shoulders
freed
from
these
hindrances
she
ran
toward
john
john
do
not
leave
me
do
not
leave
me
as
she
spoke
she
reached
an
open
space
among
the
trees
and
john
turned
toward
her
her
hat
had
fallen
off
and
the
red
golden
threads
of
her
hair
freed
from
their
fastenings
streamed
behind
her
never
before
had
a
vision
of
such
exquisite
loveliness
sped
through
the
moonbeams
so
entrancing
was
her
beauty
to
john
that
he
stood
motionless
in
admiration
he
did
not
go
to
meet
her
as
he
should
have
done
and
perhaps
as
he
would
have
done
had
his
senses
not
been
wrapped
in
benumbing
wonderment
his
eyes
were
unable
to
interpret
to
his
brain
all
her
marvellous
beauty
and
his
other
senses
abandoning
their
proper
functions
had
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
his
sight
he
saw
he
heard
he
felt
her
loveliness
thus
occupied
he
did
not
move
so
dorothy
ran
to
him
and
fell
upon
his
breast
you
did
not
come
to
meet
me
she
sobbed
you
made
me
come
all
the
way
to
forgive
you
cruel
cruel
john
held
the
girl
in
his
arms
but
he
did
not
dare
to
kiss
her
and
his
soon
brought
its
reward
he
had
not
expected
that
she
would
come
a
beggar
to
him
the
most
he
had
dared
to
hope
was
that
she
would
listen
to
his
prayer
for
forgiveness
with
all
his
worldly
wisdom
john
had
not
learned
the
fact
that
inconstancy
does
not
destroy
love
in
the
one
who
suffers
by
reason
of
it
nor
did
he
know
of
the
exquisite
happiness
which
comes
to
a
gentle
passionate
heart
such
as
dorothy
from
the
mere
act
of
forgiving
is
it
possible
you
can
forgive
me
for
the
miserable
lies
i
have
uttered
asked
john
almost
unconscious
of
the
words
he
was
speaking
is
it
possible
you
can
forgive
me
for
uttering
those
lies
dorothy
he
repeated
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
softly
passing
her
hand
over
the
lace
of
his
doublet
whispered
if
i
could
believe
they
were
lies
i
could
easily
forgive
you
she
answered
between
low
sobs
and
soft
sighs
though
she
was
a
woman
the
sweet
essence
of
childhood
was
in
her
heart
but
you
can
not
believe
me
even
when
i
tell
you
that
i
spoke
not
the
truth
answered
john
with
growing
faith
in
his
system
of
passive
repentance
again
came
the
sighs
and
a
few
struggling
childish
sobs
it
is
easy
for
us
to
believe
that
which
we
long
to
believe
she
said
then
she
turned
her
face
upward
to
him
and
john
reward
was
altogether
disproportioned
to
the
he
had
exercised
a
few
minutes
before
she
rewarded
him
far
beyond
his
deserts
and
after
a
pause
she
said
mischievously
you
told
me
that
you
were
a
bold
man
with
women
and
i
know
that
at
least
that
part
of
what
you
said
was
untrue
for
you
are
a
bashful
man
john
you
are
downright
bashful
it
is
i
who
have
been
bold
you
were
too
timid
to
woo
me
and
i
so
longed
for
you
that
i
i
was
not
timid
for
god
sake
dorothy
i
beg
you
to
have
pity
and
to
make
no
jest
of
me
your
kindness
almost
kills
me
and
your
ridicule
there
there
john
whispered
the
girl
i
will
never
again
make
a
jest
of
you
if
it
gives
you
pain
tell
me
john
tell
me
truly
was
it
all
false
that
which
you
told
me
about
the
other
women
there
had
been
more
truth
in
john
bragging
than
he
cared
to
confess
he
feared
and
loathed
a
lie
so
he
said
evasively
but
with
perfect
truth
you
must
know
my
goddess
if
you
do
not
know
without
the
telling
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
being
if
you
do
not
know
that
there
is
for
me
and
ever
will
be
no
woman
but
you
in
all
the
world
if
you
do
not
know
that
you
have
stolen
my
soul
and
that
i
live
only
in
your
presence
all
that
i
can
say
will
avail
nothing
toward
convincing
you
i
am
almost
crazed
with
love
for
you
and
with
pain
and
torture
for
the
love
of
god
let
me
leave
you
that
i
may
hide
my
face
never
cried
the
girl
clasping
her
hands
about
his
neck
and
pressing
her
lips
gently
upon
his
never
there
that
will
soothe
you
wo
it
john
it
did
soothe
him
and
in
the
next
moment
john
almost
frenzied
with
joy
hurt
the
girl
by
the
violence
of
his
embraces
but
she
found
her
heaven
in
the
pain
they
went
back
to
the
stone
bench
beside
the
gate
and
after
a
little
time
dorothy
said
but
tell
me
john
would
you
have
kissed
the
other
woman
would
you
really
have
done
it
john
honesty
certainly
was
good
policy
in
that
instance
the
adroit
girl
had
set
a
trap
for
him
i
suppose
i
would
answered
john
with
a
groan
it
hurts
me
to
hear
the
fact
said
dorothy
sighing
but
it
pleases
me
to
hear
the
truth
i
know
all
else
you
tell
me
is
true
i
was
trying
you
when
i
asked
the
question
for
i
certainly
knew
what
you
intended
to
do
a
woman
instinctively
knows
when
a
man
is
going
to
to
when
anything
of
that
sort
is
about
to
happen
how
does
she
know
asked
john
rocks
and
breakers
ahead
for
dorothy
i
can
not
tell
you
replied
the
girl
naïvely
but
she
knows
perhaps
it
is
the
awakened
desire
in
her
own
heart
which
forewarns
her
said
john
stealthily
seeking
from
dorothy
a
truth
that
would
pain
him
should
he
learn
it
i
suppose
that
is
partly
the
source
of
her
knowledge
replied
the
knowing
one
with
a
great
show
of
innocence
in
her
manner
john
was
in
no
position
to
ask
impertinent
questions
nor
had
he
any
right
to
grow
angry
at
unpleasant
discoveries
but
he
did
both
although
for
a
time
he
suppressed
the
latter
you
believe
she
is
sure
to
know
do
you
he
asked
usually
she
replied
of
course
there
are
times
when
when
it
happens
so
suddenly
that
john
angrily
sprang
to
his
feet
took
a
few
hurried
steps
in
front
of
dorothy
who
remained
demurely
seated
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
then
again
he
took
his
place
beside
her
on
the
stone
bench
he
was
trembling
with
anger
and
jealousy
the
devil
was
in
the
girl
that
night
for
mischief
i
suppose
you
speak
from
the
fulness
of
your
experience
demanded
john
in
tones
that
would
have
been
insulting
had
they
not
been
pleasing
to
the
girl
she
had
seen
the
drift
of
john
questions
at
an
early
stage
of
the
conversation
and
his
easily
aroused
jealousy
was
good
proof
to
her
of
his
affection
after
all
she
was
in
no
danger
from
rocks
and
breakers
she
well
knew
the
currents
eddies
rocks
and
shoals
of
the
sea
she
was
navigating
although
she
had
never
before
sailed
it
her
all
the
way
back
to
eve
had
been
making
charts
of
those
particular
waters
for
her
especial
benefit
why
do
we
a
cumbersome
army
of
men
continue
to
do
battle
with
the
foe
at
whose
hands
defeat
is
always
our
portion
experience
queried
dorothy
her
head
turned
to
one
side
in
a
attitude
experience
of
course
that
is
the
only
way
we
learn
anything
john
again
sprang
to
his
feet
and
again
he
sat
down
beside
the
girl
he
had
so
recently
received
forgiveness
for
his
own
sins
that
he
dared
not
be
unforgiving
toward
dorothy
he
did
not
speak
and
she
remained
silent
willing
to
allow
time
for
the
situation
to
take
its
full
effect
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
is
black
ignorance
compared
with
the
cunning
of
a
girl
in
dorothy
situation
god
gives
her
wit
for
the
occasion
as
he
gives
the
cat
soft
paws
sharp
claws
and
nimbleness
she
was
teaching
john
a
lesson
he
would
never
forget
she
was
binding
him
to
her
with
hoops
of
steel
i
know
that
i
have
not
the
right
to
ask
said
john
suppressing
his
emotions
but
may
i
know
merely
as
a
matter
of
trivial
information
may
i
know
the
name
of
of
the
person
this
fellow
with
whom
you
have
had
so
full
an
experience
god
curse
him
tell
me
his
name
he
caught
the
girl
violently
by
both
arms
as
if
he
would
shake
the
truth
out
of
her
he
was
unconsciously
making
full
amends
for
the
faults
he
had
committed
earlier
in
the
evening
the
girl
made
no
answer
john
powers
of
which
were
not
of
the
strongest
order
were
exhausted
and
he
again
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
towering
before
her
in
a
passion
tell
me
his
name
he
said
hoarsely
i
demand
it
i
will
not
rest
till
i
kill
him
if
you
would
kill
him
i
surely
will
not
tell
you
his
name
in
truth
i
admit
i
am
very
fond
of
him
speak
not
another
word
to
me
till
you
tell
me
his
name
stormed
john
i
feel
sorry
for
john
when
i
think
of
the
part
he
played
in
this
interview
but
every
man
knows
well
his
condition
i
care
not
continued
john
in
what
manner
i
have
offended
you
nor
does
my
debt
of
gratitude
to
you
for
your
generosity
in
forgiving
my
sins
weigh
one
scruple
against
this
you
have
told
me
no
man
unless
he
were
a
poor
clown
would
endure
it
and
i
tell
you
now
with
all
my
love
for
you
i
will
not
i
will
not
dorothy
was
beginning
to
fear
him
she
of
course
did
not
fear
personal
violence
but
after
all
while
he
was
slower
than
she
he
was
much
stronger
every
way
and
when
aroused
his
strength
imposed
itself
upon
her
and
she
feared
to
play
him
any
farther
sit
beside
me
john
and
i
will
tell
you
his
name
said
the
girl
looking
up
to
him
and
then
casting
down
her
eyes
a
dimpling
smile
was
playing
about
her
lips
no
i
will
not
sit
by
you
replied
john
angrily
she
partly
rose
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
drew
him
to
her
side
tell
me
his
name
again
demanded
john
sitting
rigidly
by
dorothy
tell
me
his
name
will
you
kill
him
she
asked
that
i
will
he
answered
of
that
you
may
rest
assured
if
you
kill
him
john
it
will
break
my
heart
for
to
do
so
you
must
commit
suicide
there
is
no
other
man
but
you
john
with
you
i
had
my
first
last
and
only
experience
john
of
course
was
speechless
he
had
received
only
what
he
deserved
i
freely
admit
he
played
the
part
of
a
fool
during
this
entire
interview
with
dorothy
and
he
was
more
fully
convinced
of
the
fact
than
either
you
or
i
can
be
i
do
not
like
to
have
a
fool
for
the
hero
of
my
history
but
this
being
a
history
and
not
a
romance
i
must
tell
you
of
events
just
as
they
happened
and
of
persons
exactly
as
they
were
else
my
conscience
will
smite
me
for
untruthfulness
dorothy
last
assault
was
too
much
for
john
he
could
neither
parry
nor
thrust
her
heart
was
full
of
mirth
and
gladness
none
other
but
you
john
she
repeated
leaning
forward
in
front
of
him
and
looking
up
into
his
eyes
a
ray
of
moonlight
stealing
its
way
between
the
forest
boughs
fell
upon
her
upturned
face
and
caused
it
to
glow
with
a
radiance
none
but
you
john
there
never
has
been
and
there
never
shall
be
another
when
john
consciousness
returned
he
said
dorothy
can
you
love
such
a
fool
as
i
that
i
can
and
that
i
do
with
all
my
heart
she
returned
and
can
you
forgive
me
for
this
last
fault
for
doubting
you
that
is
easily
done
she
answered
softly
because
doubt
is
the
child
of
love
but
you
do
not
doubt
me
he
replied
she
answered
somewhat
haltingly
but
i
i
am
a
woman
and
a
woman
heart
is
the
home
of
faith
said
john
reverentially
she
responded
still
not
quite
sure
of
her
ground
sometimes
it
is
the
home
of
too
much
faith
but
faith
like
virtue
is
its
own
reward
few
persons
are
false
to
one
who
gives
a
blind
unquestioning
faith
even
a
poor
degree
of
honor
responds
to
it
in
kind
dorothy
i
am
so
unworthy
of
you
that
i
stand
abashed
in
your
presence
replied
john
no
you
are
not
unworthy
of
me
we
do
look
for
unmixed
good
in
men
said
the
girl
with
a
mischievous
little
laugh
then
seriously
those
virtues
you
have
are
so
great
and
so
strong
john
that
my
poor
little
virtues
while
they
perhaps
are
more
numerous
than
yours
are
but
weak
things
by
comparison
in
truth
there
are
some
faults
in
men
which
we
women
do
not
do
not
altogether
dislike
they
cause
us
they
make
us
oh
i
can
not
express
exactly
what
i
mean
they
make
us
more
eager
perhaps
a
too
constant
man
is
like
an
overstrong
sweet
he
cloys
us
the
faults
i
speak
of
hurt
us
but
we
thrive
on
them
women
enjoy
pain
now
and
then
malcolm
was
telling
me
the
other
day
that
the
wise
people
of
the
east
have
a
saying
shadow
there
can
be
no
light
without
death
there
can
be
no
life
without
suffering
there
can
be
no
joy
surely
is
that
saying
true
of
women
she
who
suffers
naught
enjoys
naught
when
a
woman
becomes
passive
john
she
is
but
a
clod
pain
gives
us
a
vent
a
vent
for
something
i
know
not
what
it
is
but
this
i
know
we
are
happier
for
it
i
fear
dorothy
that
i
have
given
you
too
much
as
you
call
it
said
john
no
no
she
replied
that
was
nothing
my
great
vent
is
that
i
can
pour
out
my
love
upon
you
john
without
stint
now
that
i
know
you
are
mine
i
have
some
one
whom
i
can
deluge
with
it
do
you
know
john
i
believe
that
when
god
made
me
he
collected
together
the
requisite
portions
of
reason
imagination
and
will
there
was
a
great
plenty
of
will
john
and
all
the
other
ingredients
that
go
to
make
a
human
being
but
after
he
had
gotten
them
all
together
there
was
still
a
great
space
left
to
be
filled
and
he
just
threw
in
an
immensity
of
love
with
which
to
complete
me
therefore
john
am
i
not
in
true
proportion
there
is
too
much
love
in
me
and
it
wells
up
at
times
and
overflows
my
heart
how
thankful
i
should
be
that
i
may
pour
it
upon
you
and
that
it
will
not
be
wasted
how
good
you
are
to
give
me
the
sweet
privilege
how
thankful
should
i
be
dorothy
i
have
never
known
you
till
this
night
i
am
unworthy
not
another
word
of
that
sort
john
she
interrupted
covering
his
mouth
with
her
hand
they
stood
for
a
long
time
talking
a
deal
of
celestial
nonsense
which
i
shall
not
give
you
i
fear
i
have
already
given
you
too
much
of
what
john
and
dorothy
did
and
said
in
this
very
sentimental
interview
but
in
no
other
way
can
i
so
well
make
you
to
know
the
persons
of
whom
i
write
i
might
have
said
dorothy
was
so
and
so
and
john
was
such
and
such
i
might
have
analyzed
them
in
long
dull
pages
of
minute
description
but
it
is
that
which
persons
do
and
say
that
gives
us
true
concept
of
their
characters
what
others
say
about
them
is
little
else
than
a
mere
statement
that
black
is
black
and
white
is
white
but
to
my
story
again
dorothy
by
her
beauty
had
won
john
admiration
when
first
he
beheld
her
when
he
met
her
afterward
her
charms
of
mind
and
her
thousand
winsome
ways
moved
him
deeply
but
upon
the
evening
of
which
i
am
now
telling
you
he
beheld
for
the
first
time
her
grand
burning
soul
and
he
saw
her
pure
heart
filled
to
overflowing
with
its
dangerous
burden
of
love
right
from
the
hands
of
god
himself
as
the
girl
had
said
john
was
of
a
coarser
fibre
than
she
who
had
put
him
up
for
her
idol
but
his
sensibilities
were
keen
and
at
their
awakening
he
saw
clearly
the
worth
of
the
priceless
treasure
which
propitious
fate
had
given
him
in
the
love
of
dorothy
and
he
sat
humbly
at
her
feet
yet
she
knew
it
not
but
sat
humbly
at
feet
the
happiest
woman
in
all
the
world
because
of
her
great
good
fortune
in
having
a
upon
whom
she
could
lavish
the
untold
wealth
of
her
heart
if
you
are
a
woman
pray
god
that
he
may
touch
your
eyes
with
dorothy
blessed
blindness
there
is
a
heaven
in
the
dark
for
you
if
you
can
find
it
i
must
leave
the
scene
though
i
am
loath
to
do
so
seldom
do
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
human
soul
and
more
seldom
still
does
it
show
itself
like
a
gust
of
god
breath
upon
the
deep
of
eternity
as
it
did
that
night
in
dorothy
after
a
time
john
said
i
have
your
promise
to
be
my
wife
do
you
still
wish
to
keep
it
what
an
absurd
question
john
replied
the
girl
laughing
softly
and
contentedly
why
else
am
i
here
tell
me
think
you
john
should
i
be
here
if
i
were
not
willing
and
eager
to
to
keep
that
promise
will
you
go
with
me
notwithstanding
your
father
hatred
of
my
house
he
asked
ah
truly
that
i
will
john
she
answered
surely
you
know
i
will
go
with
you
let
us
go
at
once
let
us
lose
not
a
moment
we
have
already
delayed
too
long
cried
john
in
eager
ecstasy
not
john
i
can
not
go
she
pleaded
think
of
my
attire
and
she
drew
my
cloak
more
closely
about
her
i
can
not
go
with
you
this
time
my
father
is
angry
with
me
because
of
you
although
he
does
not
know
who
you
are
is
it
not
famous
to
have
a
lover
in
secret
of
whom
nobody
knows
father
is
angry
with
me
and
as
i
told
you
in
my
letter
he
keeps
me
a
prisoner
in
my
rooms
aunt
dorothy
stands
guard
over
me
the
dear
simple
old
soul
she
told
me
thinking
i
was
malcolm
that
she
was
too
old
to
be
duped
by
a
girl
oh
it
was
too
comical
and
she
threw
back
her
head
and
gave
forth
a
peal
of
laughter
that
john
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
silence
i
would
so
delight
to
tell
you
of
the
scene
when
i
was
in
aunt
dorothy
room
impersonating
malcolm
but
i
have
so
much
else
to
say
of
more
importance
that
i
know
i
shall
not
tell
the
half
when
you
have
left
me
i
shall
remember
what
i
most
wished
to
say
but
forgot
no
john
she
continued
seriously
my
father
has
been
cruel
to
me
and
i
try
to
make
myself
think
i
do
not
love
him
but
i
fail
for
i
do
love
him
tears
were
welling
up
in
her
eyes
and
stifling
her
voice
in
a
moment
she
continued
it
would
kill
him
john
were
i
to
go
with
you
now
i
go
with
you
soon
i
give
you
my
solemn
promise
to
that
but
i
can
not
go
now
not
now
i
can
not
leave
him
and
the
others
with
all
his
cruelty
to
me
i
love
him
john
next
to
you
he
will
not
come
to
see
me
nor
will
he
speak
to
me
think
of
that
the
tears
that
had
welled
up
to
her
eyes
fell
in
a
piteous
stream
over
her
cheeks
aunt
dorothy
and
madge
she
continued
are
so
dear
to
me
that
the
thought
of
leaving
them
is
torture
but
i
will
go
with
you
some
day
john
some
day
soon
i
promise
you
they
have
always
been
kind
and
gentle
to
me
and
i
love
them
and
my
father
and
my
dear
home
where
i
was
born
and
where
my
sweet
mother
died
and
dolcy
i
love
them
all
so
dearly
that
i
must
prepare
myself
to
leave
them
john
even
to
go
with
you
the
heart
strings
of
my
whole
life
bind
me
to
them
forgive
me
john
forgive
me
you
must
think
of
the
grief
and
pain
i
shall
yet
pass
through
to
go
to
you
it
is
as
i
told
you
we
women
reach
heaven
only
through
purgatory
i
must
forsake
all
else
i
love
when
i
go
to
you
all
all
all
that
has
been
dear
to
me
in
life
i
must
forsake
for
for
that
which
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
itself
i
promise
john
to
go
with
you
but
but
forgive
me
i
can
not
go
nor
can
i
ask
it
of
you
dorothy
said
john
the
sacrifice
would
be
all
on
one
side
i
should
forego
nothing
and
i
should
receive
all
you
would
forego
everything
and
god
help
me
you
would
receive
nothing
worth
having
i
am
unworthy
not
that
word
john
cried
dorothy
again
covering
his
mouth
with
well
not
with
her
hand
i
shall
give
up
a
great
deal
she
continued
and
i
know
i
shall
suffer
i
suffer
even
now
when
i
think
of
it
for
you
must
remember
that
i
am
rooted
to
my
home
and
to
the
dear
ones
it
shelters
but
i
will
soon
make
the
exchange
john
i
shall
make
it
gladly
when
the
time
comes
because
because
i
feel
that
i
could
not
live
if
i
did
not
make
it
my
father
has
already
consented
to
our
marriage
said
john
i
told
him
all
that
had
passed
between
you
and
me
he
of
course
was
greatly
pained
at
first
but
when
i
told
him
of
your
perfections
he
said
that
if
you
and
i
were
dear
to
each
other
he
would
offer
no
opposition
but
would
welcome
you
to
his
heart
is
your
father
that
that
sort
of
a
man
asked
dorothy
half
in
revery
i
have
always
heard
and
she
hesitated
i
know
replied
john
that
you
have
heard
much
evil
of
my
father
but
let
us
not
talk
on
that
theme
you
will
know
him
some
day
and
you
may
judge
him
for
yourself
when
will
you
go
with
me
dorothy
soon
very
soon
john
she
answered
you
know
father
intends
that
i
shall
marry
lord
stanley
intend
otherwise
the
more
father
hurries
this
marriage
with
my
beautiful
cousin
the
sooner
i
shall
be
be
your
that
is
you
know
the
sooner
i
shall
go
with
you
you
will
not
allow
your
father
to
force
you
to
marry
lord
stanley
asked
john
frightened
by
the
thought
ah
cried
the
girl
softly
you
know
i
told
you
that
god
had
put
into
me
a
great
plenty
of
will
father
calls
it
wilfulness
but
whichever
it
is
it
stands
me
in
good
hand
now
you
do
know
how
much
i
have
of
it
you
never
will
know
until
i
am
your
your
wife
the
last
word
was
spoken
in
a
soft
hesitating
whisper
and
her
head
sought
shamefaced
refuge
on
john
breast
of
course
the
magic
word
wife
on
dorothy
lips
aroused
john
to
action
and
but
a
cloud
at
that
moment
passed
over
the
moon
and
kindly
obscured
the
scene
you
do
not
blame
me
john
said
dorothy
because
i
can
not
go
with
you
you
do
not
blame
me
indeed
i
do
not
my
goddess
answered
john
you
will
soon
be
mine
i
shall
await
your
pleasure
and
your
own
time
and
when
you
choose
to
come
to
me
ah
then
and
the
kindly
cloud
came
back
to
the
moon
chapter
x
thomas
the
man
servant
after
a
great
effort
of
john
told
dorothy
it
was
time
for
her
to
return
to
the
hall
and
he
walked
with
her
down
bowling
green
hill
to
the
wall
back
of
the
terrace
garden
dorothy
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
stile
at
the
old
stone
wall
and
john
clasping
her
hand
said
you
will
perhaps
see
me
sooner
than
you
expect
and
then
the
cloud
considerately
floated
over
the
moon
again
and
john
hurried
away
up
bowling
green
hill
dorothy
crossed
the
terrace
garden
going
toward
the
door
since
known
as
dorothy
postern
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
postern
steps
when
she
heard
her
father
voice
beyond
the
north
wall
of
the
terrace
garden
well
up
toward
bowling
green
hill
john
she
knew
was
at
that
moment
climbing
the
hill
immediately
following
the
sound
of
her
father
voice
she
heard
another
voice
that
of
her
father
retainer
sir
john
guild
then
came
the
word
halt
quickly
followed
by
the
report
of
a
fusil
and
the
sharp
clinking
of
swords
upon
the
hillside
she
ran
back
to
the
wall
and
saw
the
dimly
outlined
forms
of
four
men
one
of
them
was
john
who
was
retreating
up
the
hill
the
others
were
following
him
sir
george
and
sir
john
guild
had
unexpectedly
returned
from
derby
they
had
left
their
horses
with
the
stable
boys
and
were
walking
toward
the
kitchen
door
when
sir
george
noticed
a
man
pass
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
terrace
garden
wall
and
proceed
up
bowling
green
hill
the
man
of
course
was
john
immediately
sir
george
and
guild
accompanied
by
a
servant
who
was
with
them
started
in
pursuit
of
the
intruder
and
a
moment
afterward
dorothy
heard
her
father
voice
and
the
discharge
of
the
fusil
she
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
stile
filled
with
an
agony
of
fear
sir
george
was
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
in
advance
of
his
companion
and
when
john
saw
that
his
pursuers
were
attacking
him
singly
he
turned
and
quickly
ran
back
to
meet
the
warlike
king
of
the
peak
by
a
few
adroit
turns
with
his
sword
john
disarmed
his
antagonist
and
rushing
in
upon
him
easily
threw
him
to
the
ground
by
a
wrestler
trick
guild
and
the
servant
by
that
time
were
within
six
yards
of
sir
george
and
john
stop
cried
manners
your
master
is
on
the
ground
at
my
feet
my
sword
point
is
at
his
heart
make
but
one
step
toward
me
and
sir
george
vernon
will
be
a
dead
man
guild
and
the
servant
halted
instantly
what
are
your
terms
cried
guild
speaking
with
the
haste
which
he
well
knew
was
necessary
if
he
would
save
his
master
life
my
terms
are
easy
answered
john
all
i
ask
is
that
you
allow
me
to
depart
in
peace
i
am
here
on
no
harmful
errand
and
i
demand
that
i
may
depart
and
that
i
be
not
followed
nor
spied
upon
by
any
one
you
may
depart
in
peace
said
guild
no
one
will
follow
you
no
one
will
spy
upon
you
to
this
i
pledge
my
knightly
word
in
the
name
of
christ
my
saviour
john
at
once
took
his
way
unmolested
up
the
hill
and
rode
home
with
his
heart
full
of
fear
lest
his
tryst
with
dorothy
had
been
discovered
guild
and
the
servant
assisted
sir
george
to
rise
and
the
three
started
down
the
hill
toward
the
stile
where
dorothy
was
standing
she
was
hidden
from
them
however
by
the
wall
jennie
faxton
who
had
been
on
guard
while
john
and
dorothy
were
at
the
gate
at
dorothy
suggestion
stood
on
top
of
the
stile
where
she
could
easily
be
seen
by
sir
george
when
he
approached
when
my
father
comes
here
and
questions
you
said
dorothy
to
jennie
faxton
tell
him
that
the
man
whom
he
attacked
was
your
sweetheart
never
fear
mistress
responded
jennie
i
will
have
a
fine
story
for
the
master
dorothy
crouched
inside
the
wall
under
the
shadow
of
a
bush
and
jennie
waited
on
the
top
of
the
stile
sir
george
thinking
the
girl
was
dorothy
lost
no
time
in
approaching
her
he
caught
her
roughly
by
the
arm
and
turned
her
around
that
he
might
see
her
face
by
god
guild
he
muttered
i
have
made
a
mistake
i
thought
the
girl
was
doll
he
left
instantly
and
followed
guild
and
the
servant
to
the
kitchen
door
when
sir
george
left
the
stile
dorothy
hastened
back
to
the
postern
of
which
she
had
the
key
and
hurried
toward
her
room
she
reached
the
door
of
her
father
room
just
in
time
to
see
sir
george
and
guild
enter
it
they
saw
her
and
supposed
her
to
be
myself
if
she
hesitated
she
was
lost
but
dorothy
never
hesitated
to
think
with
her
was
to
act
she
did
not
of
course
know
that
i
was
still
in
her
apartments
she
took
the
chance
however
and
boldly
followed
sir
john
guild
into
her
room
there
she
paused
for
a
moment
that
she
might
not
appear
to
be
in
too
great
haste
and
then
entered
aunt
dorothy
room
where
i
was
seated
waiting
for
her
dorothy
my
dear
child
exclaimed
lady
crawford
clasping
her
arms
about
dorothy
neck
there
is
no
time
to
waste
in
sentiment
aunt
dorothy
responded
the
girl
here
are
your
sword
and
cloak
malcolm
i
thank
you
for
their
use
don
them
quickly
i
did
so
and
walked
into
sir
george
room
where
that
worthy
old
gentleman
was
dressing
a
slight
wound
in
the
hand
i
stopped
to
speak
with
him
but
he
seemed
disinclined
to
talk
and
i
left
the
room
he
soon
went
to
the
upper
court
and
i
presently
followed
him
dorothy
changed
her
garments
and
she
lady
crawford
and
madge
also
came
to
the
upper
court
the
braziers
in
the
courtyard
had
been
lighted
and
cast
a
glare
over
two
score
men
and
women
who
had
been
aroused
from
their
beds
by
the
commotion
of
the
conflict
on
the
hillside
upon
the
upper
steps
of
the
courtyard
stood
sir
george
and
jennie
faxton
who
was
the
man
you
were
with
roughly
demanded
sir
george
of
the
trembling
jennie
jennie
trembling
was
assumed
for
the
occasion
i
will
not
tell
you
his
name
she
replied
with
tears
he
is
my
sweetheart
and
i
will
never
come
to
the
hall
again
matters
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
a
maiden
can
not
speak
with
her
sweetheart
at
the
stile
without
he
is
set
upon
and
beaten
as
if
he
were
a
hedgehog
my
father
is
your
leal
henchman
and
his
daughter
deserves
better
treatment
at
your
hands
than
you
have
given
me
there
there
said
sir
george
placing
his
hand
upon
her
head
i
was
in
the
wrong
i
did
not
know
you
had
a
sweetheart
who
wore
a
sword
when
i
saw
you
at
the
stile
i
was
sure
you
were
another
i
am
glad
i
was
wrong
so
was
dorothy
glad
everybody
be
off
to
bed
said
sir
george
ben
shaw
see
that
the
braziers
are
all
blackened
dorothy
madge
and
lady
crawford
returned
to
the
latter
room
and
sir
george
and
i
entered
after
them
he
was
evidently
softened
in
heart
by
the
night
adventures
and
by
the
mistake
he
supposed
he
had
made
a
selfish
man
grows
hard
toward
those
whom
he
injures
a
generous
heart
grows
tender
sir
george
was
generous
and
the
injustice
he
thought
he
had
done
to
dorothy
made
him
eager
to
offer
amends
the
active
evil
in
all
sir
george
was
the
fact
that
he
conscientiously
thought
he
was
in
the
right
many
a
man
has
gone
to
hell
backward
with
his
face
honestly
toward
heaven
sir
george
had
not
spoken
to
dorothy
since
the
scene
wherein
the
key
to
bowling
green
gate
played
so
important
a
part
doll
said
sir
george
i
thought
you
were
at
the
stile
with
a
man
i
was
mistaken
it
was
the
faxton
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
my
daughter
i
did
you
wrong
you
do
me
wrong
in
many
matters
father
replied
dorothy
perhaps
i
do
her
father
returned
perhaps
i
do
but
i
mean
for
the
best
i
seek
your
happiness
you
take
strange
measures
at
times
father
to
bring
about
my
happiness
she
replied
whom
god
loveth
he
chasteneth
replied
sir
george
dolefully
that
manner
of
loving
may
be
well
enough
for
god
retorted
dorothy
with
no
thought
of
irreverence
but
for
man
it
is
dangerous
whom
man
loves
he
should
cherish
a
man
who
has
a
good
obedient
daughter
one
who
loves
him
will
not
imprison
her
and
above
all
he
will
not
refuse
to
speak
to
her
nor
will
he
cause
her
to
suffer
and
to
weep
for
lack
of
that
love
which
is
her
right
a
man
has
no
right
to
bring
a
girl
into
this
world
and
then
cause
her
to
suffer
as
you
as
you
she
ceased
speaking
and
sought
refuge
in
silent
feminine
eloquence
tears
one
would
have
sworn
she
had
been
grievously
injured
that
night
but
i
am
older
than
you
doll
and
i
know
what
is
best
for
your
happiness
said
sir
george
there
are
some
things
father
which
a
girl
knows
with
better
surer
knowledge
than
the
oldest
man
living
solomon
was
wise
because
he
had
so
many
wives
from
whom
he
could
absorb
wisdom
ah
well
answered
sir
george
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
you
will
have
the
last
word
confess
father
she
retorted
quickly
that
you
want
the
last
word
yourself
perhaps
i
do
want
it
but
i
never
have
it
returned
sir
george
kiss
me
doll
and
be
my
child
again
that
i
will
right
gladly
she
answered
throwing
her
arms
about
her
father
neck
and
kissing
him
with
real
affection
then
sir
george
said
good
night
and
started
to
leave
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
stood
for
a
little
time
in
thought
dorothy
said
he
speaking
to
lady
crawford
i
relieve
you
of
your
duty
as
a
guard
over
doll
she
may
go
and
come
when
she
chooses
i
thank
you
george
said
aunt
dorothy
the
task
has
been
painful
to
me
dorothy
went
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
again
and
sir
george
departed
when
the
door
was
closed
lady
crawford
breathed
a
great
sigh
and
said
i
thank
heaven
dorothy
he
does
not
know
that
you
have
been
out
of
your
room
how
could
you
treat
me
so
cruelly
how
could
you
deceive
me
that
aunt
dorothy
replied
the
niece
is
because
you
are
not
old
enough
yet
to
be
a
match
for
a
girl
who
is
who
is
in
love
shame
upon
you
dorothy
said
lady
crawford
shame
upon
you
to
act
as
you
did
and
now
to
speak
so
plainly
about
being
in
love
malcolm
said
you
were
not
a
modest
girl
and
i
am
beginning
to
believe
him
did
malcolm
speak
so
ill
of
me
asked
dorothy
turning
toward
me
with
a
smile
in
her
eyes
my
lady
aunt
said
i
turning
to
lady
crawford
when
did
i
say
that
dorothy
was
an
immodest
girl
you
did
not
say
it
the
old
lady
admitted
dorothy
herself
said
it
and
she
proves
her
words
to
be
true
by
speaking
so
boldly
of
her
feelings
toward
this
this
strange
man
and
she
speaks
before
madge
too
perhaps
madge
is
in
the
same
sort
of
trouble
who
knows
cried
dorothy
laughing
heartily
madge
blushed
painfully
but
continued
dorothy
seriously
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
i
am
proud
of
it
for
what
else
my
dear
aunt
was
i
created
but
to
be
in
love
tell
me
dear
aunt
for
what
else
was
i
created
perhaps
you
are
right
returned
the
old
lady
who
in
fact
was
sentimentally
inclined
the
chief
end
of
woman
after
all
is
to
love
said
dorothy
what
would
become
of
the
human
race
if
it
were
not
child
child
cried
the
aunt
where
learned
you
such
things
they
were
written
upon
my
mother
breast
continued
dorothy
and
i
learned
them
when
i
took
in
my
life
with
her
milk
i
pray
they
may
be
written
upon
my
breast
some
day
if
god
in
his
goodness
shall
ever
bless
me
with
a
baby
girl
a
man
child
could
not
read
the
words
dorothy
dorothy
cried
lady
crawford
you
shock
me
you
pain
me
again
i
ask
responded
dorothy
for
what
else
was
i
created
i
tell
you
aunt
dorothy
the
world
decrees
that
women
shall
remain
in
ignorance
or
in
pretended
ignorance
in
silence
at
least
regarding
the
things
concerning
which
they
have
the
greatest
need
to
be
wise
and
talkative
at
your
age
dorothy
i
did
not
have
half
your
wisdom
on
the
subject
answered
lady
crawford
tell
me
my
sweet
aunt
dorothy
were
you
really
in
a
state
of
ignorance
such
as
you
would
have
me
believe
well
responded
the
old
lady
hesitatingly
i
did
not
speak
of
such
matters
why
aunt
did
you
not
asked
dorothy
were
you
ashamed
of
what
god
had
done
were
you
ashamed
of
his
great
purpose
in
creating
you
a
woman
and
in
creating
your
mother
and
your
mother
mother
before
you
no
no
child
no
no
but
i
can
not
argue
with
you
perhaps
you
are
right
said
aunt
dorothy
then
tell
me
dear
aunt
that
i
am
not
immodest
and
bold
when
i
speak
concerning
that
of
which
my
heart
is
full
to
overflowing
god
put
it
there
aunt
not
i
surely
i
am
not
immodest
by
reason
of
his
act
no
no
my
sweet
child
returned
aunt
dorothy
beginning
to
weep
softly
no
no
you
are
not
immodest
you
are
worth
a
thousand
weak
fools
such
as
i
was
at
your
age
poor
aunt
dorothy
had
been
forced
into
a
marriage
which
had
wrecked
her
life
dorothy
words
opened
her
aunt
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
girl
whom
she
so
dearly
loved
was
being
thrust
by
sir
george
into
the
same
wretched
fate
through
which
she
had
dragged
her
own
suffering
heart
for
so
many
years
from
that
hour
she
was
dorothy
ally
good
night
malcolm
said
lady
crawford
offering
me
her
hand
i
kissed
it
tenderly
then
i
kissed
the
sweet
old
lady
cheek
and
said
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
aunt
dorothy
i
thank
you
malcolm
she
returned
i
took
my
leave
and
soon
madge
went
to
her
room
leaving
dorothy
and
lady
crawford
together
when
madge
had
gone
the
two
dorothys
one
at
each
end
of
life
spanned
the
long
years
that
separated
them
and
became
one
in
heart
by
reason
of
a
heartache
common
to
both
lady
crawford
seated
herself
and
dorothy
knelt
by
her
chair
tell
me
dorothy
said
the
old
lady
tell
me
do
you
love
this
man
so
tenderly
so
passionately
that
you
can
not
give
him
up
ah
my
dear
aunt
the
girl
responded
words
can
not
tell
you
can
not
know
what
i
feel
alas
i
know
only
too
well
my
child
i
too
loved
a
man
when
i
was
your
age
and
none
but
god
knows
what
i
suffered
when
i
was
forced
by
my
parents
and
the
priests
to
give
him
up
and
to
wed
one
whom
god
help
me
i
loathed
oh
my
sweet
aunt
cried
dorothy
softly
throwing
her
arms
about
the
old
lady
neck
and
kissing
her
cheek
how
terribly
you
must
have
suffered
yes
responded
lady
crawford
and
i
am
resolved
you
shall
not
endure
the
same
fate
i
hope
the
man
who
has
won
your
love
is
worthy
of
you
do
not
tell
me
his
name
for
i
do
not
wish
to
practise
greater
deception
toward
your
father
than
i
must
but
you
may
tell
me
of
his
station
in
life
and
of
his
person
that
i
may
know
he
is
not
unworthy
of
you
his
station
in
life
answered
dorothy
is
far
better
than
mine
in
person
he
is
handsome
beyond
any
woman
wildest
dream
of
manly
beauty
in
character
he
is
noble
generous
and
good
he
is
far
beyond
my
deserts
aunt
dorothy
then
why
does
he
not
seek
your
hand
from
your
father
asked
the
aunt
that
i
may
not
tell
you
aunt
dorothy
returned
the
girl
unless
you
would
have
me
tell
you
his
name
and
that
i
dare
not
do
although
he
is
vastly
my
superior
in
station
in
blood
and
in
character
still
my
father
would
kill
me
before
he
would
permit
me
to
marry
this
man
of
my
choice
and
i
dear
aunt
fear
i
shall
die
if
i
have
him
not
light
slowly
dawned
upon
aunt
dorothy
mind
and
she
exclaimed
in
a
terrified
whisper
my
god
child
is
it
he
yes
responded
the
girl
yes
it
is
he
do
not
speak
his
name
dorothy
the
old
lady
said
do
not
speak
his
name
so
long
as
you
do
not
tell
me
i
can
not
know
with
certainty
who
he
is
after
a
pause
aunt
dorothy
continued
perhaps
child
it
was
his
father
whom
i
loved
and
was
compelled
to
give
up
may
the
blessed
virgin
pity
us
sweet
aunt
cried
dorothy
caressingly
and
help
us
returned
lady
crawford
i
too
shall
help
you
she
continued
it
will
be
through
no
fault
of
mine
if
your
life
is
wasted
as
mine
has
been
dorothy
kissed
her
aunt
and
retired
next
morning
when
dorothy
arose
a
song
came
from
her
heart
as
it
comes
from
the
skylark
when
it
sees
the
sun
at
dawn
because
it
can
not
help
singing
it
awakened
aunt
dorothy
and
she
began
to
live
her
life
anew
in
brightness
as
she
steeped
her
soul
in
the
youth
and
joyousness
of
dorothy
vernon
song
i
have
spoken
before
in
this
chronicle
of
will
dawson
he
was
a
conformer
possibly
it
was
by
reason
of
his
religious
faith
that
he
did
not
share
the
general
enmity
that
existed
in
haddon
hall
against
the
house
of
rutland
he
did
not
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
know
sir
john
manners
and
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
heir
to
rutland
was
the
man
who
had
of
late
been
causing
so
much
trouble
to
the
house
of
vernon
at
least
if
he
did
suspect
it
no
one
knew
of
his
suspicions
sir
george
made
a
great
effort
to
learn
who
the
mysterious
interloper
was
but
he
wholly
failed
to
obtain
any
clew
to
his
identity
he
had
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
dorothy
mysterious
lover
was
a
man
of
low
degree
he
had
taken
for
granted
that
he
was
an
adventurer
whose
station
and
person
precluded
him
from
openly
wooing
his
daughter
he
did
not
know
that
the
heir
to
rutland
was
in
the
derbyshire
country
for
john
after
his
first
meeting
with
dorothy
had
carefully
concealed
his
presence
from
everybody
save
the
inmates
of
rutland
in
fact
his
mission
to
rutland
required
secrecy
and
the
rutland
servants
and
retainers
were
given
to
understand
as
much
even
had
sir
george
known
of
john
presence
at
rutland
the
old
gentleman
mind
could
not
have
compassed
the
thought
that
dorothy
who
he
believed
hated
the
race
of
manners
with
an
intensity
equalled
only
by
his
own
feelings
could
be
induced
to
exchange
a
word
with
a
member
of
the
house
his
uncertainty
was
not
the
least
of
his
troubles
and
although
dorothy
had
full
liberty
to
come
and
go
at
will
her
father
kept
constant
watch
over
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir
george
had
given
dorothy
liberty
partly
for
the
purpose
of
watching
her
and
he
hoped
to
discover
thereby
and
if
possible
to
capture
the
man
who
had
brought
trouble
to
his
household
sir
george
had
once
hanged
a
man
to
a
tree
on
bowling
green
hill
by
no
other
authority
than
his
own
desire
that
execution
was
the
last
in
england
under
the
old
saxon
law
of
infangthef
and
outfangthef
sir
george
had
been
summoned
before
parliament
for
the
deed
but
the
writ
had
issued
against
the
king
of
the
peak
and
that
being
only
a
sobriquet
was
neither
sir
george
name
nor
his
title
so
the
writ
was
quashed
and
the
act
of
personal
justice
was
not
farther
investigated
by
the
authorities
should
my
cousin
capture
his
daughter
lover
there
would
certainly
be
another
execution
under
the
old
saxon
law
so
you
see
that
my
friend
manners
was
tickling
death
with
a
straw
for
dorothy
sake
one
day
dawson
approached
sir
george
and
told
him
that
a
man
sought
employment
in
the
household
of
haddon
hall
sir
george
placed
great
confidence
in
his
forester
so
he
told
dawson
to
employ
the
man
if
his
services
were
needed
the
new
servant
proved
to
be
a
fine
strong
fellow
having
a
great
shock
of
hair
and
a
bushy
beard
of
rusty
red
dawson
engaged
the
newcomer
and
assigned
to
him
the
duty
of
kindling
the
fires
in
the
family
apartments
of
the
hall
the
name
of
the
new
servant
was
thomas
thompson
a
name
that
dorothy
soon
abbreviated
to
one
day
she
said
to
him
by
way
of
opening
the
acquaintance
thomas
you
and
i
should
be
good
friends
we
have
so
much
in
common
thank
you
my
lady
responded
thomas
greatly
pleased
i
hope
we
shall
be
good
friends
indeed
indeed
i
do
but
i
can
not
tell
wherein
i
am
so
fortunate
as
to
have
anything
in
common
with
your
ladyship
what
is
it
may
i
ask
of
which
we
have
so
much
in
common
so
much
hair
responded
dorothy
laughing
it
were
blasphemy
lady
to
compare
my
hair
with
yours
returned
thomas
your
hair
i
make
sure
is
such
as
the
blessed
virgin
had
i
ask
your
pardon
for
speaking
so
plainly
but
your
words
put
the
thought
into
my
mind
and
perhaps
they
gave
me
license
to
speak
thomas
was
on
his
knees
placing
wood
upon
the
fire
thomas
returned
dorothy
you
need
never
apologize
to
a
lady
for
making
so
fine
a
speech
i
declare
a
courtier
could
not
have
made
a
better
one
perhaps
i
have
lived
among
courtiers
lady
said
thomas
i
doubt
not
replied
dorothy
derisively
you
would
have
me
believe
you
are
above
your
station
it
is
the
way
with
all
new
servants
i
suppose
you
have
seen
fine
company
and
better
days
i
have
never
seen
finer
company
than
now
and
i
have
never
known
better
days
than
this
responded
courtier
thomas
dorothy
thought
he
was
presuming
on
her
condescension
and
was
about
to
tell
him
so
when
he
continued
the
servants
at
haddon
hall
are
gentlefolk
compared
with
servants
at
other
places
where
i
have
worked
and
i
desire
nothing
more
than
to
find
favor
in
sir
george
eyes
i
would
do
anything
to
achieve
that
end
dorothy
was
not
entirely
reassured
by
thomas
closing
words
but
even
if
they
were
presumptuous
she
admired
his
wit
in
giving
them
an
inoffensive
turn
from
that
day
forth
the
acquaintance
grew
between
the
servant
and
mistress
until
it
reached
the
point
of
familiarity
at
which
dorothy
dubbed
him
frequently
dorothy
was
startled
by
remarks
made
by
thomas
having
in
them
a
strong
dash
of
familiarity
but
he
always
gave
to
his
words
a
harmless
turn
before
she
could
resent
them
at
times
however
she
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
intention
within
a
week
after
thomas
advent
to
the
hall
dorothy
began
to
suspect
that
the
new
servant
looked
upon
her
with
eyes
of
great
favor
she
frequently
caught
him
watching
her
and
at
such
times
his
eyes
which
dorothy
thought
were
really
very
fine
would
glow
with
an
ardor
all
too
evident
his
manner
was
cause
for
amusement
rather
than
concern
and
since
she
felt
kindly
toward
the
new
servant
she
thought
to
create
a
faithful
ally
by
treating
him
graciously
she
might
she
thought
need
help
when
the
time
should
come
for
her
to
leave
haddon
hall
with
john
if
that
happy
time
should
ever
come
she
did
not
realize
that
the
most
dangerous
watchful
enemy
to
her
cherished
scheme
would
be
a
man
who
was
himself
in
love
with
her
even
though
he
were
a
servant
and
she
looked
on
thomas
evident
infatuation
with
a
smile
she
did
not
once
think
that
in
the
end
it
might
cause
her
great
trouble
so
she
accepted
his
mute
admiration
and
thought
to
make
use
of
it
later
on
to
tom
therefore
dorothy
was
gracious
john
had
sent
word
to
dorothy
by
jennie
faxton
that
he
had
gone
to
london
and
would
be
there
for
a
fortnight
or
more
sir
george
had
given
permission
to
his
daughter
to
ride
out
whenever
she
wished
to
do
so
but
he
had
ordered
that
dawson
or
i
should
follow
in
the
capacity
of
spy
and
dorothy
knew
of
the
censorship
though
she
pretended
ignorance
of
it
so
long
as
john
was
in
london
she
did
not
care
who
followed
her
but
i
well
knew
that
when
manners
should
return
dorothy
would
again
begin
manoeuvring
and
that
by
some
cunning
trick
she
would
see
him
illustration
one
afternoon
i
was
temporarily
absent
from
the
hall
and
dorothy
wished
to
ride
dawson
was
engaged
and
when
dorothy
had
departed
he
ordered
tom
to
ride
after
his
mistress
at
a
respectful
distance
nearly
a
fortnight
had
passed
since
john
had
gone
to
london
and
when
dorothy
rode
forth
that
afternoon
she
was
beginning
to
hope
he
might
have
returned
and
that
by
some
delightful
possibility
he
might
then
be
loitering
about
the
old
at
bowling
green
gate
there
was
a
conviction
in
her
heart
that
he
would
be
there
she
determined
therefore
to
ride
toward
rowsley
to
cross
the
wye
at
her
former
and
to
go
up
to
bowling
green
gate
on
the
devonshire
side
of
the
haddon
wall
she
had
no
reason
other
than
the
feeling
born
of
her
wishes
to
believe
that
john
would
be
there
but
she
loved
the
spot
for
the
sake
of
the
memories
which
hovered
about
it
she
well
knew
that
some
one
would
follow
her
from
the
hall
but
she
felt
sure
that
in
case
the
spy
proved
to
be
dawson
or
myself
she
could
easily
arrange
matters
to
her
satisfaction
if
by
good
fortune
she
should
find
her
lover
at
the
gate
tom
rode
so
far
behind
his
mistress
that
she
could
not
determine
who
was
following
her
whenever
she
brought
dolcy
to
a
walk
also
walked
his
horse
when
dorothy
galloped
he
galloped
but
after
dorothy
had
crossed
the
wye
and
had
taken
the
wall
over
into
the
devonshire
lands
tom
also
crossed
the
river
and
wall
and
quickly
rode
to
her
side
he
uncovered
and
bowed
low
with
a
familiarity
of
manner
that
startled
her
the
act
of
riding
up
to
her
and
the
manner
in
which
he
took
his
place
by
her
side
were
presumptuous
to
the
point
of
insolence
and
his
attitude
although
not
openly
offensive
was
slightly
alarming
she
put
dolcy
to
a
gallop
but
the
servant
who
she
thought
was
presuming
on
her
former
graciousness
kept
close
at
dolcy
heels
the
man
was
a
stranger
and
she
knew
nothing
of
his
character
she
was
alone
in
the
forest
with
him
and
she
did
not
know
to
what
length
his
absurd
passion
for
her
might
lead
him
she
was
alarmed
but
she
despised
cowardice
although
she
knew
herself
to
be
a
coward
and
she
determined
to
ride
to
the
gate
which
was
but
a
short
distance
ahead
of
her
she
resolved
that
if
the
insolent
fellow
continued
his
familiarity
she
would
teach
him
a
lesson
he
would
never
forget
when
she
was
within
a
short
distance
of
the
gate
she
sprang
from
dolcy
and
handed
her
rein
to
her
servant
john
was
not
there
but
she
went
to
the
gate
in
the
hope
that
a
letter
might
be
hidden
beneath
the
stone
bench
where
jennie
was
wont
to
find
them
in
times
past
dorothy
found
no
letter
but
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
sit
down
upon
the
bench
where
he
and
she
had
sat
and
to
dream
over
the
happy
moments
she
had
spent
there
tom
instead
of
holding
the
horses
hitched
them
and
walked
toward
dorothy
that
act
on
the
part
of
her
servant
was
effrontery
of
the
most
insolent
sort
will
dawson
himself
would
not
have
dared
do
such
a
thing
it
filled
her
with
alarm
and
as
tom
approached
she
was
trying
to
determine
in
what
manner
she
would
crush
him
but
when
the
audacious
thomas
having
reached
the
gate
seated
himself
beside
his
mistress
on
the
stone
bench
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
in
fright
and
indignation
she
began
to
realize
the
extent
of
her
foolhardiness
in
going
to
that
secluded
spot
with
a
stranger
how
dare
you
approach
me
in
this
insolent
fashion
cried
dorothy
breathless
with
fear
mistress
vernon
responded
thomas
looking
boldly
up
into
her
pale
face
i
wager
you
a
gold
pound
sterling
that
if
you
permit
me
to
remain
here
by
your
side
ten
minutes
you
will
be
unwilling
john
john
cried
the
girl
exultantly
tom
snatched
the
red
beard
from
his
face
and
dorothy
after
one
fleeting
luminous
look
into
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
knees
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
she
wept
and
john
bending
over
the
kneeling
girl
kissed
her
sunlit
hair
cruel
cruel
sobbed
dorothy
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
clasped
her
hands
about
his
neck
is
it
not
strange
she
continued
that
i
should
have
felt
so
sure
of
seeing
you
my
reason
kept
telling
me
that
my
hopes
were
absurd
but
a
stronger
feeling
full
of
the
breath
of
certainty
seemed
to
assure
me
that
you
would
be
here
it
impelled
me
to
come
though
i
feared
you
after
we
crossed
the
wall
but
reason
fear
and
caution
were
powerless
to
keep
me
away
you
did
not
know
my
voice
said
john
nor
did
you
penetrate
my
disguise
you
once
said
that
you
would
recognize
me
though
i
wore
all
the
petticoats
in
derbyshire
please
do
jest
with
me
now
pleaded
dorothy
i
can
not
bear
it
great
joy
is
harder
to
endure
than
great
grief
why
did
you
not
reveal
yourself
to
me
at
the
hall
she
asked
plaintively
i
found
no
opportunity
returned
john
others
were
always
present
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
that
followed
it
is
no
affair
of
yours
nor
of
mine
they
were
overjoyed
in
being
together
once
more
neither
of
them
seemed
to
realize
that
john
while
living
under
sir
george
roof
was
facing
death
every
moment
to
dorothy
the
fact
that
john
who
was
heir
to
one
of
england
noblest
houses
was
willing
for
her
sake
to
become
a
servant
to
do
a
servant
work
and
to
receive
the
indignities
constantly
put
upon
a
servant
appealed
most
powerfully
it
added
to
her
feeling
for
him
a
tenderness
which
is
not
necessarily
a
part
of
passionate
love
it
is
needless
for
me
to
tell
you
that
while
john
performed
faithfully
the
duty
of
keeping
bright
the
fires
in
haddon
hall
he
did
not
neglect
the
other
flame
the
one
in
dorothy
heart
for
the
sake
of
whose
warmth
he
had
assumed
the
leathern
garb
of
servitude
and
had
placed
his
head
in
the
lion
mouth
at
first
he
and
dorothy
used
great
caution
in
exchanging
words
and
glances
but
familiarity
with
danger
breeds
contempt
for
it
so
they
utilized
every
opportunity
that
niggard
chance
offered
and
blinded
by
their
great
longing
soon
began
to
make
opportunities
for
speech
with
each
other
thereby
bringing
trouble
to
dorothy
and
deadly
peril
to
john
of
that
i
shall
soon
tell
you
during
the
period
of
john
service
in
haddon
hall
negotiations
for
dorothy
marriage
with
lord
stanley
were
progressing
slowly
but
surely
arrangements
for
the
marriage
settlement
by
the
stanleys
and
for
dorothy
dower
to
be
given
by
sir
george
were
matters
that
the
king
of
the
peak
approached
boldly
as
he
would
have
met
any
other
affair
of
business
but
the
earl
of
derby
whose
mind
moved
slowly
desiring
that
a
generous
portion
of
the
vernon
wealth
should
be
transferred
with
dorothy
to
the
stanley
holdings
without
the
delay
incident
to
sir
george
death
put
off
signing
the
articles
of
marriage
in
his
effort
to
augment
the
cash
payment
in
truth
the
great
wealth
which
dorothy
would
bring
to
the
house
of
stanley
was
the
earl
real
reason
for
desiring
her
marriage
with
his
son
the
earl
was
heavily
in
debt
and
his
estate
stood
in
dire
need
of
help
sir
george
though
attracted
by
the
high
nobility
of
the
house
of
stanley
did
not
relish
the
thought
that
the
wealth
he
had
accumulated
by
his
own
efforts
and
the
vernon
estates
which
had
come
down
to
him
through
centuries
should
go
to
pay
lord
derby
debts
he
therefore
insisted
that
dorothy
dower
should
be
her
separate
estate
and
demanded
that
it
should
remain
untouched
and
untouchable
by
either
of
the
stanleys
that
arrangement
did
not
suit
my
lord
earl
and
although
the
son
since
he
had
seen
dorothy
at
was
eager
to
possess
the
beautiful
girl
his
father
did
not
share
his
ardor
lawyers
were
called
in
who
looked
expensively
wise
but
they
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
employed
an
agreement
of
marriage
was
made
and
was
drawn
up
on
an
imposing
piece
of
parchment
brave
with
ribbons
pompous
with
seals
and
fair
in
clerkly
penmanship
one
day
sir
george
showed
me
the
copy
of
the
contract
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
that
evening
at
the
cost
of
much
labor
he
and
i
went
over
the
indenture
word
for
word
and
when
we
had
finished
sir
george
thought
it
was
very
good
indeed
he
seemed
to
think
that
all
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
marriage
were
overcome
when
the
agreement
that
lay
before
us
on
the
table
had
been
achieved
between
him
and
the
earl
i
knew
sir
george
troubles
had
only
begun
for
i
was
aware
of
a
fact
which
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
learn
though
of
late
dorothy
had
given
him
much
teaching
thereto
i
knew
that
he
had
transmitted
to
his
daughter
a
large
portion
of
his
own
fierce
stubborn
unbreakable
will
and
that
in
her
it
existed
in
its
most
deadly
form
the
feminine
to
me
after
supper
that
night
was
assigned
the
task
of
reading
and
rereading
many
times
to
sir
george
the
contents
of
the
beautiful
parchment
when
i
would
read
a
clause
that
particularly
pleased
my
cousin
he
insisted
on
celebrating
the
event
by
drinking
a
mug
of
liquor
drawn
from
a
huge
leather
stoup
which
sat
upon
the
table
between
us
by
the
time
i
had
made
several
readings
of
the
interesting
document
the
characters
began
to
mingle
in
a
way
that
did
not
impart
ease
and
clearness
to
my
style
some
of
the
strange
combinations
which
i
and
the
liquor
extracted
from
amid
the
seals
and
ribbons
puzzled
sir
george
not
a
little
but
with
each
new
libation
he
found
new
clauses
and
fresh
causes
for
though
to
speak
exact
truth
i
more
than
once
married
sir
george
to
the
earl
of
derby
and
in
my
profanity
gave
lord
james
stanley
to
the
devil
to
have
and
to
hold
sir
george
was
rapidly
falling
before
his
mighty
enemy
drink
and
i
was
not
far
behind
him
though
i
admit
the
fault
with
shame
my
cousin
for
a
while
was
mightily
pleased
with
the
contract
but
when
the
liquor
had
brought
him
to
a
point
where
he
was
entirely
candid
with
himself
he
let
slip
the
fact
that
after
all
there
was
regret
at
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
metaphorically
and
actually
before
his
final
surrender
to
drink
he
dropped
the
immediate
consideration
of
the
contract
and
said
malcolm
i
have
in
my
time
known
many
fools
but
if
you
will
permit
an
old
man
who
loves
you
dearly
to
make
a
plain
statement
of
his
conviction
certainly
i
interrupted
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
he
continued
to
say
that
i
believe
you
to
be
the
greatest
fool
the
good
god
ever
permitted
to
live
i
am
sure
sir
george
that
your
condescending
flattery
is
very
pleasing
i
said
sir
george
unmindful
of
my
remark
continued
your
disease
is
not
usually
a
deadly
malady
as
a
look
about
you
will
easily
show
but
malcolm
if
you
were
one
whit
more
of
a
fool
you
certainly
would
perish
i
was
not
offended
for
i
knew
that
my
cousin
meant
no
offence
then
sir
george
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
i
wish
to
commit
suicide
i
have
always
at
hand
an
easy
painless
mode
of
death
i
shall
become
only
a
little
more
of
a
fool
i
laughingly
said
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
absorb
a
little
wisdom
now
and
then
as
a
preventive
never
a
bit
of
wisdom
will
you
ever
absorb
a
man
who
would
refuse
a
girl
whose
wealth
and
beauty
are
as
great
as
dorothy
is
past
all
hope
i
often
awaken
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
night
when
a
man
troubles
stalk
about
his
bed
like
livid
demons
and
when
i
think
that
all
of
this
evil
which
has
come
up
between
dorothy
and
me
and
all
of
this
cursed
estrangement
which
is
eating
out
my
heart
could
have
been
averted
if
you
had
consented
to
marry
her
i
can
not
but
feel
but
sir
george
i
interrupted
it
was
dorothy
not
i
who
refused
she
could
never
have
been
brought
to
marry
me
do
tell
me
malcolm
do
tell
me
cried
the
old
man
angrily
drink
had
made
sir
george
sullen
and
violent
it
made
me
happy
at
first
but
with
liquor
in
excess
there
always
came
to
me
a
sort
of
frenzy
do
tell
me
continued
sir
george
there
never
lived
a
vernon
who
could
win
a
woman
if
he
would
try
but
put
all
that
aside
she
would
have
obeyed
me
i
would
have
forced
her
to
marry
you
and
she
would
have
thanked
me
afterward
you
could
never
have
forced
her
to
marry
me
i
replied
but
that
i
could
and
that
i
would
have
done
said
sir
george
the
like
is
done
every
day
girls
in
these
modern
times
are
all
perverse
but
they
are
made
to
yield
take
the
cases
of
sir
thomas
mobley
sir
grant
rhodas
and
william
kimm
their
daughters
all
refused
to
marry
the
men
chosen
for
them
but
the
wenches
were
made
to
yield
if
i
had
a
daughter
who
refused
to
obey
me
i
would
break
her
i
would
break
her
yes
by
god
i
would
break
her
if
i
had
to
kill
her
and
the
old
man
brought
his
clenched
hand
down
upon
the
oak
table
with
a
crash
his
eyes
glared
frightfully
and
his
face
bore
a
forbidding
expression
which
boded
no
good
for
dorothy
she
will
make
trouble
in
this
matter
sir
george
continued
tapping
the
parchment
with
his
middle
finger
she
will
make
trouble
about
this
but
by
god
malcolm
she
shall
obey
me
he
struck
the
oaken
table
another
great
blow
with
his
fist
and
glared
fiercely
across
at
me
lord
wyatt
had
trouble
with
his
daughter
when
he
made
the
marriage
with
devonshire
continued
sir
george
a
damned
good
match
it
was
too
for
the
girl
but
she
had
her
heart
set
on
young
gillman
and
she
refused
to
obey
her
father
she
refused
by
god
point
blank
to
obey
her
father
she
refused
to
obey
the
man
who
had
given
her
life
what
did
wyatt
do
he
was
a
man
who
knew
what
a
child
owes
to
its
father
and
by
god
malcolm
after
trying
every
other
means
to
bring
the
wench
to
her
senses
after
he
had
tried
persuasion
after
having
in
two
priests
and
a
bishop
to
show
her
how
badly
she
was
acting
and
after
he
had
tried
to
reason
with
her
he
whipped
her
yes
he
whipped
her
till
she
bled
till
she
bled
malcolm
i
tell
you
ah
wyatt
knew
what
is
due
from
a
child
to
its
parents
the
whipping
failed
to
bring
the
perverse
huzzy
to
obedience
so
wyatt
threw
her
into
a
dungeon
and
starved
her
till
till
till
she
died
i
interrupted
yes
till
she
died
mumbled
sir
george
sullenly
till
she
died
and
it
served
her
right
by
god
served
her
right
the
old
man
was
growing
very
drunk
and
everything
was
beginning
to
appear
distorted
to
me
sir
george
rose
to
his
feet
leaned
toward
me
with
glaring
eyes
struck
the
table
a
terrible
blow
with
his
fist
and
said
by
the
blood
of
god
i
swear
that
if
doll
refuses
to
marry
stanley
and
persists
in
her
refusal
i
whip
her
wyatt
is
a
man
after
my
own
heart
i
starve
her
i
kill
her
ay
if
i
loved
her
ten
thousand
times
more
than
i
do
i
would
kill
her
or
she
should
obey
me
then
dawned
upon
me
a
vision
of
terrible
possibilities
i
was
sure
sir
george
could
not
force
dorothy
to
marry
against
her
will
but
i
feared
lest
he
might
kill
her
in
his
effort
to
break
her
i
do
not
mean
that
i
feared
he
would
kill
her
by
a
direct
act
unless
he
should
do
so
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
induced
by
drink
and
passion
but
i
did
fear
for
the
results
of
the
breaking
process
the
like
had
often
happened
it
had
happened
in
the
case
of
wyatt
daughter
dorothy
under
the
intoxicating
influence
of
her
passion
might
become
so
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
a
martyr
that
she
could
calmly
take
a
flogging
but
my
belief
was
that
should
matters
proceed
to
that
extreme
should
sir
george
flog
his
daughter
the
chords
of
her
highly
strung
nature
would
snap
under
the
tension
and
she
would
die
i
loved
dorothy
for
the
sake
of
her
fierce
passionate
tender
heart
and
because
she
loved
me
and
even
in
my
sober
reflective
moments
i
had
resolved
that
my
life
ay
and
sir
george
life
also
should
stand
between
the
girl
and
the
lash
if
in
calmness
i
could
deliberately
form
such
a
resolution
imagine
the
effect
on
my
brain
of
sir
george
words
and
the
vista
of
horrors
they
disclosed
i
was
intoxicated
i
was
drunk
i
say
it
with
shame
and
on
hearing
sir
george
threat
my
imagination
ran
riot
into
the
foreboding
future
all
the
candles
save
one
tottering
wick
were
dead
in
their
sockets
and
the
room
was
filled
with
lowering
shadows
from
oaken
floor
to
grimy
vaulted
roof
beams
sir
george
hardly
conscious
of
what
he
did
and
said
all
his
evil
passions
quickened
with
drink
leaned
his
hands
upon
the
table
and
glared
across
at
me
he
seemed
to
be
the
incarnation
of
rage
and
ferocity
to
so
great
a
pitch
had
he
wrought
himself
the
sputtering
candle
feebly
flickered
and
seemed
to
give
its
dim
light
only
that
the
darksome
shadows
might
flit
and
hover
about
us
like
vampires
on
the
scent
of
blood
a
cold
perspiration
induced
by
a
nameless
fear
came
upon
me
and
in
that
dark
future
to
which
my
heated
imagination
travelled
i
saw
as
if
revealed
by
black
magic
fair
sweet
generous
dorothy
standing
piteously
upon
bowling
green
hillside
over
her
drooping
form
there
hung
in
air
a
monster
cloudlike
image
of
her
father
holding
in
its
hand
a
deadly
bludgeon
so
black
so
horrid
was
this
that
i
sprang
from
my
chair
with
a
frightful
oath
and
shrieked
hell
is
made
for
man
because
of
his
cruelty
to
woman
sir
george
had
sunk
into
his
chair
liquor
had
finished
its
work
and
the
old
man
resting
his
head
upon
his
folded
arms
leaned
forward
on
the
table
he
was
drunk
dead
to
the
world
how
long
i
stood
in
frenzied
stupor
gazing
at
dorothy
upon
the
hillside
i
do
not
know
it
must
have
been
several
minutes
blood
of
christ
how
vividly
i
remember
the
vision
the
sunny
radiance
of
the
girl
hair
was
darkened
and
dead
her
bending
attitude
was
one
of
abject
grief
her
hands
covered
her
face
and
she
was
the
image
of
woe
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
with
the
quick
impulsive
movement
so
familiar
in
her
and
with
a
cry
eloquent
as
a
child
wail
for
its
mother
called
john
and
held
out
her
arms
imploringly
toward
the
dim
shadowy
form
of
her
lover
standing
upon
the
hill
crest
then
john
form
began
to
fade
and
as
its
shadowy
essence
grew
dim
despair
slowly
stole
like
a
mask
of
death
over
dorothy
face
she
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
vacantly
into
space
then
she
fell
to
the
ground
the
shadow
of
her
father
hovering
over
her
prostrate
form
and
the
words
dead
dead
dead
came
to
me
in
horrifying
whispers
from
every
dancing
in
the
room
in
trying
to
locate
the
whispers
as
they
reverberated
from
floor
to
oaken
rafters
i
turned
and
saw
sir
george
he
looked
as
if
he
were
dead
why
should
you
not
be
dead
in
fact
i
cried
you
would
kill
your
daughter
why
should
i
not
kill
you
that
will
solve
the
whole
question
i
revelled
in
the
thought
i
drank
it
in
i
nursed
it
i
cuddled
it
i
kissed
it
nature
brutish
love
for
murder
had
deluged
my
soul
i
put
my
hand
to
my
side
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
my
sword
or
my
knife
i
had
neither
with
me
then
i
remember
staggering
toward
the
fireplace
to
get
one
of
the
with
which
to
kill
my
cousin
i
remember
that
when
i
grasped
the
by
the
strange
working
of
habit
i
employed
it
for
the
moment
in
its
proper
use
and
as
i
began
to
stir
the
embers
on
the
hearth
my
original
purpose
was
forgotten
that
moment
of
forgetfulness
saved
me
and
saved
sir
george
life
i
remember
that
i
sank
into
the
chair
in
front
of
the
fireplace
holding
the
iron
and
i
thank
god
that
i
remember
nothing
more
during
the
night
the
servants
aroused
me
and
i
staggered
up
the
stone
stairway
of
eagle
tower
and
clambered
into
my
room
the
next
morning
i
awakened
feeling
ill
there
was
a
taste
in
my
mouth
as
if
i
had
been
chewing
a
piece
of
the
devil
boot
over
night
i
wanted
no
breakfast
so
i
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tower
hoping
the
fresh
morning
breeze
might
cool
my
head
and
cleanse
my
mouth
for
a
moment
or
two
i
stood
on
the
tower
roof
bareheaded
and
while
i
drank
in
the
fresh
purifying
air
the
sweet
draught
helped
me
physically
but
all
the
winds
of
boreas
could
not
have
blown
out
of
my
head
the
vision
of
the
previous
night
the
question
was
it
prophetic
kept
ringing
in
my
ears
answerless
save
by
a
superstitious
feeling
of
fear
then
the
horrid
thought
that
i
had
only
by
a
mere
chance
missed
becoming
a
murderer
came
upon
me
and
again
was
crowded
from
my
mind
by
the
memory
of
dorothy
and
the
hovering
spectre
which
had
hung
over
her
head
on
bowling
green
hillside
i
walked
to
the
north
side
of
the
tower
and
on
looking
down
the
first
person
i
saw
was
our
new
servant
thomas
holding
two
horses
at
the
mounting
stand
one
of
them
was
dolcy
and
i
feeling
that
a
brisk
ride
with
dorothy
would
help
me
to
throw
off
my
wretchedness
quickly
descended
the
tower
stairs
stopped
at
my
room
for
my
hat
and
cloak
and
walked
around
to
the
mounting
block
dorothy
was
going
to
ride
and
i
supposed
she
would
prefer
me
to
the
new
servant
as
a
companion
i
asked
thomas
if
his
mistress
were
going
out
for
a
ride
and
he
replied
affirmatively
who
is
to
accompany
her
i
asked
she
gave
orders
for
me
to
go
with
her
he
answered
very
well
i
responded
take
your
horse
back
to
the
stable
and
fetch
mine
the
man
hesitated
and
twice
he
began
to
make
reply
but
finally
he
said
very
well
sir
malcolm
he
hitched
dolcy
to
the
ring
in
the
mounting
block
and
started
back
toward
the
stable
leading
his
own
horse
at
that
moment
dorothy
came
out
of
the
tower
gate
dressed
for
the
ride
surely
no
woman
was
ever
more
beautiful
than
she
that
morning
where
are
you
taking
the
horse
she
cried
to
the
stable
mistress
answered
the
servant
sir
malcolm
says
he
will
go
with
you
dorothy
joyousness
vanished
from
radiant
brightness
her
expression
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
to
a
look
of
disappointment
so
sorrowful
that
i
at
once
knew
there
was
some
great
reason
why
she
did
not
wish
me
to
ride
with
her
i
could
not
divine
the
reason
neither
did
i
try
i
quickly
said
to
thomas
do
not
bring
my
horse
if
mistress
vernon
will
excuse
me
i
shall
not
ride
with
her
this
morning
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
i
had
not
breakfasted
again
came
to
dorothy
face
the
radiant
look
of
joy
as
if
to
affirm
what
it
had
already
told
me
i
looked
toward
thomas
and
his
eyes
too
were
alight
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
thomas
was
a
fellow
notwithstanding
his
preposterous
hair
and
beard
but
i
felt
sure
there
could
be
no
understanding
between
the
man
and
his
mistress
when
thomas
and
dorothy
had
mounted
she
timidly
ventured
to
say
we
are
sorry
cousin
malcolm
that
you
can
not
ride
with
us
she
did
not
give
me
an
opportunity
to
change
my
mind
but
struck
dolcy
a
sharp
blow
with
her
whip
that
sent
the
spirited
mare
galloping
toward
the
and
thomas
quickly
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
dorothy
took
the
path
down
the
wye
toward
rowsley
i
of
course
connected
her
strange
conduct
with
john
when
a
young
woman
who
is
well
balanced
physically
mentally
and
morally
acts
in
a
strange
unusual
manner
you
may
depend
on
it
there
is
a
man
somewhere
behind
her
motive
i
knew
that
john
was
in
london
only
the
night
before
i
had
received
word
from
rutland
castle
that
he
had
not
returned
and
that
he
was
not
expected
home
for
many
days
so
i
concluded
that
john
could
not
be
behind
my
fair
cousin
motive
i
tried
to
stop
guessing
at
the
riddle
dorothy
had
set
me
but
my
effort
was
useless
i
wondered
and
thought
and
guessed
but
i
brought
to
myself
only
the
answer
great
is
the
mystery
of
womanhood
after
dorothy
had
ridden
away
i
again
climbed
to
the
top
of
eagle
tower
and
saw
the
riders
cross
the
wye
at
dorothy
former
and
take
the
wall
i
then
did
a
thing
that
fills
me
with
shame
when
i
think
of
it
for
the
only
time
in
my
whole
life
i
acted
the
part
of
a
spy
i
hurried
to
bowling
green
gate
and
horror
upon
horror
there
i
beheld
my
cousin
dorothy
in
the
arms
of
thomas
the
i
do
not
know
why
the
truth
of
thomas
identity
did
not
dawn
upon
me
but
it
did
not
and
i
stole
away
from
the
gate
thinking
that
dorothy
after
all
was
no
better
than
the
other
women
i
had
known
at
various
times
in
my
life
and
i
resolved
to
tell
john
what
i
had
seen
you
must
remember
that
the
women
i
had
known
were
of
the
courts
of
mary
stuart
and
of
guise
and
the
less
we
say
about
them
the
better
god
pity
them
prior
to
my
acquaintance
with
dorothy
and
madge
i
had
always
considered
a
man
to
be
a
fool
who
would
put
his
faith
in
womankind
to
me
women
were
as
good
as
men
no
better
no
worse
but
with
my
knowledge
of
those
two
girls
there
had
grown
up
in
me
a
faith
in
woman
virtue
which
in
my
opinion
is
man
greatest
comforter
the
lack
of
it
his
greatest
torment
i
went
back
to
eagle
tower
and
stood
at
my
window
looking
down
the
wye
hoping
soon
to
see
dorothy
returning
home
i
did
not
feel
jealousy
in
the
sense
that
a
lover
would
feel
it
but
there
was
a
pain
in
my
heart
a
mingling
of
grief
anger
and
resentment
because
dorothy
had
destroyed
not
only
my
faith
in
her
but
alas
my
sweet
faith
in
womankind
through
her
fault
i
had
fallen
again
to
my
old
black
belief
that
virtue
was
only
another
name
for
the
lack
of
opportunity
it
is
easy
for
a
man
who
has
never
known
virtue
in
woman
to
bear
and
forbear
the
lack
of
it
but
when
once
he
has
known
the
priceless
treasure
doubt
becomes
excruciating
pain
after
an
hour
or
two
dorothy
and
her
servant
appeared
at
the
ford
and
took
the
path
up
the
wye
toward
haddon
thomas
was
riding
a
short
distance
behind
his
accommodating
mistress
and
as
they
approached
the
hall
i
recognized
something
familiar
in
his
figure
at
first
the
feeling
of
recognition
was
indistinct
but
when
the
riders
drew
near
something
about
the
man
his
poise
on
the
horse
a
trick
with
the
rein
or
a
turn
with
his
stirrup
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
startled
me
like
a
flash
in
the
dark
and
the
word
john
sprang
to
my
lips
the
wonder
of
the
thing
drove
out
of
my
mind
all
power
to
think
i
could
only
feel
happy
so
i
lay
down
upon
my
bed
and
soon
dropped
off
to
sleep
when
i
awakened
i
was
rapt
in
peace
for
i
had
again
found
my
treasured
faith
in
womankind
i
had
hardly
dared
include
madge
in
my
backsliding
but
i
had
come
perilously
near
doing
it
and
the
thought
of
my
narrow
escape
from
such
perfidy
frightened
me
i
have
never
taken
the
risk
since
that
day
i
would
not
believe
the
testimony
of
my
own
eyes
against
the
evidence
of
my
faith
in
madge
i
knew
that
thomas
was
sir
john
manners
and
yet
i
did
not
know
it
certainly
i
determined
if
possible
to
remain
in
partial
ignorance
hoping
that
i
might
with
some
small
show
of
truth
be
able
to
plead
ignorance
should
sir
george
accuse
me
of
bad
faith
in
having
failed
to
tell
him
of
john
presence
in
haddon
hall
that
sir
george
would
sooner
or
later
discover
thomas
identity
i
had
little
doubt
that
he
would
kill
him
should
he
once
have
him
in
his
power
i
had
no
doubt
at
all
hence
although
i
had
awakened
in
peace
concerning
dorothy
you
may
understand
that
i
awakened
to
trouble
concerning
john
chapter
xi
the
cost
mark
of
joy
peace
had
been
restored
between
dorothy
and
her
father
at
least
an
armistice
had
been
tacitly
declared
but
owing
to
dorothy
knowledge
of
her
father
intention
that
she
should
marry
lord
stanley
and
because
of
sir
george
feeling
that
dorothy
had
determined
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
the
belligerent
powers
maintained
a
defensive
attitude
which
rendered
an
absolute
reconciliation
impossible
they
were
ready
for
war
at
a
moment
notice
the
strangest
part
of
their
relation
was
the
failure
of
each
to
comprehend
and
fully
to
realize
the
full
strength
of
the
other
purpose
dorothy
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
her
father
who
had
until
within
the
last
few
weeks
been
kind
and
indulgent
to
her
seriously
intended
to
force
her
into
marriage
with
a
creature
so
despicable
as
stanley
in
fact
she
did
not
believe
that
her
father
could
offer
lasting
resistance
to
her
ardent
desire
in
any
matter
such
an
untoward
happening
had
never
befallen
her
dorothy
had
learned
to
believe
from
agreeable
experience
that
it
was
a
crime
in
any
one
bordering
on
treason
to
thwart
her
ardent
desires
it
is
true
she
had
in
certain
events
been
compelled
to
coax
and
even
to
weep
gently
on
a
few
extreme
occasions
she
had
been
forced
to
do
a
little
storming
in
order
to
have
her
own
way
but
that
any
presumptuous
individuals
should
resist
her
will
after
the
storming
had
been
resorted
to
was
an
event
of
such
recent
happening
in
her
life
that
she
had
not
grown
familiar
with
the
thought
of
it
therefore
while
she
felt
that
her
father
might
seriously
annoy
her
with
the
stanley
project
and
while
she
realized
that
she
might
be
compelled
to
resort
to
the
storming
process
in
a
degree
thitherto
uncalled
for
she
believed
that
the
storm
she
would
raise
would
blow
her
father
entirely
out
of
his
absurd
and
utterly
untenable
position
on
the
other
hand
while
sir
george
anticipated
trouble
with
dorothy
he
had
never
been
able
to
believe
that
she
would
absolutely
refuse
to
obey
him
in
those
olden
times
now
nearly
half
a
century
past
filial
disobedience
was
rare
the
refusal
of
a
child
to
obey
a
parent
and
especially
the
refusal
of
a
daughter
to
obey
her
father
in
the
matter
of
marriage
was
then
looked
upon
as
a
crime
and
was
frequently
punished
in
a
way
which
amounted
to
barbarous
ferocity
sons
being
of
the
privileged
side
of
humanity
might
occasionally
disobey
with
impunity
but
woe
to
the
poor
girl
who
dared
set
up
a
will
of
her
own
a
man
who
could
not
compel
obedience
from
his
daughter
was
looked
upon
as
a
poor
weakling
and
contempt
was
his
portion
in
the
eyes
of
his
in
the
eyes
of
his
i
should
like
to
say
growing
out
of
such
conditions
was
the
firm
belief
on
the
part
of
sir
george
that
dorothy
would
in
the
end
obey
him
but
if
by
any
hard
chance
she
should
be
guilty
of
the
high
crime
of
disobedience
well
sir
george
intended
to
prevent
the
crime
perhaps
mere
stubborness
and
fear
of
the
contempt
in
which
he
would
be
held
by
his
friends
in
case
he
were
defeated
by
his
own
daughter
were
no
small
parts
of
sir
george
desire
to
carry
through
the
enterprise
in
which
he
had
embarked
with
the
stanleys
although
there
was
no
doubt
in
sir
george
mind
that
he
would
eventually
conquer
in
the
conflict
with
dorothy
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
the
power
of
his
antagonist
to
do
temporary
battle
and
he
did
not
care
to
enter
into
actual
hostilities
until
hostilities
should
become
actually
necessary
therefore
upon
the
second
day
after
i
had
read
the
beribboned
besealed
contract
to
sir
george
he
sent
an
advance
guard
toward
the
enemy
line
he
placed
the
ornamental
piece
of
parchment
in
lady
crawford
hands
and
directed
her
to
give
it
to
dorothy
but
before
i
tell
you
of
the
parchment
i
must
relate
a
scene
that
occurred
in
aunt
dorothy
room
a
few
hours
after
i
recognized
john
as
he
rode
up
the
wye
with
dorothy
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
i
read
the
contract
to
sir
george
and
saw
the
horrid
vision
on
bowling
green
i
was
sitting
with
madge
at
the
west
window
of
dorothy
parlor
we
were
watching
the
sun
as
it
sank
in
splendor
beneath
overhaddon
hill
i
should
like
first
to
tell
you
a
few
words
only
a
few
i
pray
you
concerning
madge
and
myself
i
will
i
have
just
said
that
madge
and
i
were
watching
the
sun
at
the
west
window
and
i
told
you
but
the
truth
for
madge
had
learned
to
see
with
my
eyes
gladly
would
i
have
given
them
to
her
outright
and
willingly
would
i
have
lived
in
darkness
could
i
have
given
light
to
her
she
gave
light
to
me
the
light
of
truth
of
purity
and
of
exalted
motive
there
had
been
no
words
spoken
by
madge
nor
me
to
any
one
concerning
the
strange
and
holy
chain
that
was
welding
itself
about
us
save
the
partial
confession
which
she
had
whispered
to
dorothy
but
notwithstanding
our
silence
our
friends
in
the
hall
understood
that
madge
and
i
were
very
dear
to
each
other
i
of
course
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
but
it
was
the
evening
hour
at
the
west
window
to
which
i
longingly
looked
forward
all
the
day
i
am
no
poet
nor
do
my
words
and
thoughts
come
with
the
rhythmic
flow
and
eloquent
imagery
of
one
to
whom
the
talent
of
poesy
is
given
but
during
those
evening
hours
it
seemed
that
with
the
soft
touch
of
madge
hand
there
ran
through
me
a
current
of
infectious
dreaming
which
kindled
my
soul
till
thoughts
of
beauty
came
to
my
mind
and
words
of
music
sprang
to
my
lips
such
as
i
had
always
considered
not
to
be
in
me
it
was
not
i
who
spoke
it
was
madge
who
saw
with
my
eyes
and
spoke
with
my
voice
to
my
vision
swayed
by
madge
subtle
influence
the
landscape
became
a
thing
of
moving
beauty
and
of
life
and
the
floating
clouds
became
a
panorama
of
ever
shifting
pictures
i
inspired
by
her
described
so
eloquently
the
wonders
i
saw
that
she
too
could
see
them
now
a
flock
of
angels
rested
on
the
azure
of
the
sky
watching
the
glory
of
phoebus
as
he
drove
his
fiery
steeds
over
the
western
edge
of
the
world
again
mount
olympus
would
grow
before
my
eyes
and
i
would
plainly
see
jove
sitting
upon
his
burnished
throne
while
gods
and
goddesses
floated
at
his
feet
and
revelled
on
the
fleecy
mountain
sides
then
would
mountain
gods
and
goddesses
dissolve
as
in
fact
they
did
dissolve
ages
ago
before
the
eyes
of
millions
who
had
thought
them
real
and
in
their
places
perhaps
would
come
a
procession
of
lions
at
the
description
of
which
would
madge
take
pretended
fright
again
would
i
see
madge
herself
in
flowing
white
robes
made
of
the
stuff
from
which
fleecy
clouds
are
wrought
all
these
wonders
would
i
describe
and
when
i
would
come
to
tell
her
of
the
fair
cloud
image
of
herself
i
would
seize
the
joyous
chance
to
make
her
understand
in
some
faint
degree
how
altogether
lovely
in
my
eyes
the
vision
was
then
would
she
smile
and
softly
press
my
hand
and
say
malcolm
it
must
be
some
one
else
you
see
in
the
cloud
though
she
was
pleased
but
when
the
hour
was
done
then
came
the
crowning
moment
of
the
day
for
as
i
would
rise
to
take
my
leave
if
perchance
we
were
alone
she
would
give
herself
to
my
arms
for
one
fleeting
instant
and
willingly
would
her
lips
await
but
there
are
moments
too
sacred
for
aught
save
holy
thought
the
theme
is
sweet
to
me
but
i
must
go
back
to
dorothy
and
tell
you
of
the
scene
i
have
promised
you
as
i
have
already
said
it
was
the
evening
following
that
upon
which
i
had
read
the
marriage
contract
to
sir
george
and
had
seen
the
vision
on
the
hillside
madge
and
i
were
sitting
at
the
west
window
dorothy
in
kindness
to
us
was
sitting
alone
by
the
fireside
in
lady
chamber
thomas
entered
the
room
with
an
armful
of
fagots
which
he
deposited
in
the
he
was
about
to
replenish
the
fire
but
dorothy
thrust
him
aside
and
said
you
shall
kindle
no
more
fires
for
me
at
least
you
shall
not
do
so
when
no
one
else
is
by
it
pains
me
that
you
at
whose
feet
i
am
unworthy
to
kneel
should
be
my
servant
thereupon
she
took
in
her
hands
the
fagot
john
had
been
holding
he
offered
to
prevent
her
but
she
said
please
john
let
me
do
this
the
doors
were
open
and
we
heard
all
that
was
said
by
dorothy
and
tom
madge
grasped
my
hand
in
surprise
and
fear
please
john
said
dorothy
if
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
be
your
servant
you
should
not
wish
to
deny
me
there
lives
but
one
person
whom
i
would
serve
there
john
i
will
give
you
another
and
you
shall
let
me
do
as
i
will
dorothy
still
holding
the
fagot
in
her
hands
pressed
it
against
breast
and
gently
pushed
him
backward
toward
a
large
armchair
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
by
the
west
side
of
the
fireplace
you
sit
there
john
and
we
will
make
believe
that
this
is
our
house
and
that
you
have
just
come
in
very
cold
from
a
ride
and
that
i
am
making
a
fine
fire
to
warm
you
is
it
pleasant
john
there
you
sit
and
warm
yourself
my
my
husband
she
said
laughingly
it
is
fine
sport
even
to
play
at
there
is
one
fagot
on
the
fire
she
said
as
she
threw
the
wood
upon
the
embers
causing
them
to
fly
in
all
directions
john
started
up
to
brush
the
scattered
embers
back
into
the
fireplace
but
dorothy
stopped
him
i
will
put
them
all
back
she
said
you
know
you
are
cold
and
very
tired
you
have
been
overseeing
the
tenantry
and
have
been
hunting
will
you
have
a
bowl
of
punch
my
my
husband
and
she
laughed
again
and
kissed
him
as
she
passed
to
the
holder
for
another
fagot
i
much
prefer
that
to
punch
said
john
laughing
softly
have
you
more
thousands
of
them
john
thousands
of
them
she
rippled
forth
a
little
laugh
and
continued
i
occupy
my
time
nowadays
in
making
them
that
i
may
always
have
a
great
supply
when
we
are
that
is
you
know
when
you
when
the
time
comes
that
you
may
require
a
great
many
to
keep
you
in
good
humor
again
came
the
laugh
merry
and
clear
as
the
tinkle
of
sterling
silver
she
laughed
again
within
a
minute
or
two
but
when
the
second
laugh
came
it
sounded
like
a
knell
dorothy
delighted
to
be
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
upon
this
occasion
she
wore
a
skirt
vast
in
width
of
a
pattern
then
much
in
vogue
the
sleeves
also
were
preposterously
large
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
times
about
her
neck
a
beautiful
white
linen
ruff
stood
out
at
least
the
eighth
part
of
an
ell
the
day
had
been
damp
and
cold
and
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
was
chilly
for
that
reason
most
fortunately
she
had
thrown
over
her
shoulders
a
wide
sable
cloak
broad
enough
to
enfold
her
many
times
and
long
enough
to
reach
nearly
to
her
knees
dorothy
thus
arrayed
was
standing
in
front
of
john
chair
she
had
just
spoken
the
words
good
humor
when
the
door
leading
to
her
father
room
opened
and
in
walked
sir
george
she
and
her
ample
skirts
and
broad
sleeves
were
between
john
and
the
door
not
one
brief
instant
did
dorothy
waste
in
thought
had
she
paused
to
put
in
motion
the
machinery
of
reason
john
would
have
been
lost
thomas
sitting
in
lady
crawford
chair
and
dorothy
standing
beside
him
would
have
told
sir
george
all
he
needed
to
know
he
might
not
have
discovered
john
identity
but
a
rope
and
a
tree
in
bowling
green
would
quickly
have
closed
the
chapter
of
mysterious
love
affair
dorothy
however
did
not
stop
to
reason
nor
to
think
she
simply
acted
without
preliminary
thought
as
the
rose
unfolds
or
as
the
lightning
strikes
she
quietly
sat
down
upon
john
knees
leaned
closely
back
against
him
spread
out
the
ample
folds
of
her
skirt
threw
the
lower
parts
of
her
broad
cape
over
her
shoulders
and
across
the
back
of
the
chair
and
sir
john
manners
was
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
come
in
father
said
dorothy
in
dulcet
tones
that
should
have
betrayed
her
i
heard
you
laughing
and
talking
said
sir
george
and
i
wondered
who
was
with
you
i
was
talking
to
madge
and
malcolm
who
are
in
the
other
room
replied
dorothy
did
not
thomas
come
in
with
fagots
asked
sir
george
i
think
he
is
replenishing
the
fire
in
the
parlor
father
or
he
may
have
gone
out
i
did
not
notice
do
you
want
him
i
do
not
especially
want
him
sir
george
answered
when
he
finishes
in
the
parlor
i
will
tell
him
that
you
want
him
said
dorothy
very
well
replied
sir
george
he
returned
to
his
room
but
he
did
not
close
the
door
the
moment
her
father
back
was
turned
dorothy
called
tom
tom
father
wants
you
and
instantly
thomas
was
standing
deferentially
by
her
side
and
she
was
seated
in
the
great
chair
it
was
a
rapid
change
i
assure
you
but
a
man
life
and
his
fortune
for
good
or
ill
often
hang
upon
a
tiny
peg
a
second
of
time
protruding
from
the
wall
of
eternity
it
serves
him
briefly
but
if
he
be
ready
for
the
vital
instant
it
may
serve
him
well
yes
mistress
said
thomas
i
go
to
him
at
once
john
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
as
he
passed
out
then
it
was
that
dorothy
laugh
sounded
like
the
chilling
tones
of
a
knell
it
was
the
laugh
of
one
almost
distraught
she
came
to
madge
and
me
laughing
but
the
laugh
quickly
changed
to
convulsive
sobs
the
strain
of
the
brief
moment
during
which
her
father
had
been
in
lady
crawford
room
had
been
too
great
for
even
her
strong
nerves
to
bear
she
tottered
and
would
have
fallen
had
i
not
caught
her
i
carried
her
to
the
bed
and
madge
called
lady
crawford
dorothy
had
swooned
when
she
wakened
she
said
dreamily
i
shall
always
keep
this
cloak
and
gown
aunt
dorothy
thought
the
words
were
but
the
incoherent
utterances
of
a
dimly
conscious
mind
but
i
knew
they
were
the
deliberate
expression
of
a
justly
grateful
heart
the
following
evening
trouble
came
about
over
the
matter
of
the
marriage
contract
you
remember
i
told
you
that
sir
george
had
sent
lady
crawford
as
an
advance
guard
to
place
the
parchment
in
the
enemy
hands
but
the
advance
guard
feared
the
enemy
and
therefore
did
not
deliver
the
contract
directly
to
dorothy
she
placed
it
conspicuously
upon
the
table
knowing
well
that
her
niece
curiosity
would
soon
prompt
an
examination
i
was
sitting
before
the
fire
in
aunt
dorothy
room
talking
to
madge
when
lady
crawford
entered
placed
the
parchment
on
the
table
and
took
a
chair
by
my
side
soon
dorothy
entered
the
room
the
roll
of
parchment
brave
with
ribbons
was
lying
on
the
table
it
attracted
her
attention
at
once
and
she
took
it
in
her
hands
what
is
this
she
asked
carelessly
her
action
was
prompted
entirely
by
idle
curiosity
that
by
the
way
was
no
small
motive
with
dorothy
she
had
the
curiosity
of
a
young
doe
receiving
no
answer
she
untied
the
ribbons
and
unrolled
the
parchment
to
investigate
its
contents
for
herself
when
the
parchment
was
unrolled
she
began
to
read
in
the
name
of
god
amen
this
indenture
of
agreement
looking
to
union
in
the
holy
bonds
of
marriage
between
the
right
honorable
lord
james
stanley
of
the
first
part
and
mistress
dorothy
vernon
of
haddon
of
the
second
part
she
read
no
farther
she
crumpled
the
beautiful
parchment
in
her
hands
walked
over
to
the
fire
and
quietly
placed
the
sacred
instrument
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
then
she
turned
away
with
a
sneer
of
contempt
upon
her
face
and
again
i
grieve
to
tell
you
this
said
in
the
name
of
god
amen
may
this
indenture
be
damned
dorothy
exclaimed
lady
crawford
horrified
at
her
niece
profanity
i
feel
shame
for
your
impious
words
i
do
care
what
you
feel
aunt
retorted
dorothy
with
a
dangerous
glint
in
her
eyes
feel
as
you
wish
i
meant
what
i
said
and
i
will
say
it
again
if
you
would
like
to
hear
it
i
will
say
it
to
father
when
i
see
him
now
aunt
dorothy
i
love
you
and
i
love
my
father
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
there
is
trouble
ahead
for
any
one
who
crosses
me
in
this
matter
she
certainly
looked
as
if
she
spoke
the
truth
then
she
hummed
a
tune
under
her
breath
a
dangerous
signal
in
dorothy
at
certain
times
soon
the
humming
turned
to
whistling
whistling
in
those
olden
days
was
looked
upon
as
a
species
of
crime
in
a
girl
dorothy
stood
by
the
window
for
a
short
time
and
then
taking
up
an
embroidery
frame
drew
a
chair
nearer
to
the
light
and
began
to
work
at
her
embroidery
in
a
moment
or
two
she
stopped
whistling
and
we
could
almost
feel
the
silence
in
the
room
madge
of
course
only
partly
knew
what
had
happened
and
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
expectant
anxious
inquiry
aunt
dorothy
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
the
fire
the
parchment
burned
slowly
lady
crawford
from
a
sense
of
duty
to
sir
george
and
perhaps
from
politic
reasons
made
two
or
three
attempts
to
speak
and
after
five
minutes
of
painful
silence
she
brought
herself
to
say
dorothy
your
father
left
the
contract
here
for
you
to
read
he
will
be
angry
when
he
learns
what
you
have
done
such
disobedience
is
sure
to
not
another
word
from
you
screamed
dorothy
springing
like
a
tigress
from
her
chair
not
another
word
from
you
or
i
will
i
will
scratch
you
i
will
kill
some
one
do
speak
to
me
ca
you
see
that
i
am
trying
to
calm
myself
for
an
interview
with
father
an
angry
brain
is
full
of
blunders
i
want
to
make
none
i
will
settle
this
affair
with
father
no
one
else
not
even
you
aunt
dorothy
shall
interfere
the
girl
turned
to
the
window
stood
beating
a
tattoo
upon
the
glass
for
a
moment
or
two
then
went
over
to
lady
crawford
and
knelt
by
her
side
she
put
her
arms
about
aunt
dorothy
neck
softly
kissed
her
and
said
forgive
me
dear
aunt
forgive
me
i
am
almost
crazed
with
my
troubles
i
love
you
dearly
indeed
indeed
i
do
madge
gropingly
went
to
dorothy
side
and
took
her
hand
dorothy
kissed
madge
hand
and
rose
to
her
feet
where
is
my
father
asked
dorothy
to
whom
a
repentant
feeling
toward
lady
crawford
had
brought
partial
calmness
i
will
go
to
him
immediately
and
will
have
this
matter
over
we
might
as
well
understand
each
other
at
once
father
seems
very
dull
at
understanding
me
but
he
shall
know
me
better
before
long
sir
george
may
have
respected
the
strength
of
his
adversary
but
dorothy
had
no
respect
for
the
strength
of
her
foe
she
was
eager
for
the
fray
when
she
had
a
disagreeable
thing
to
do
she
always
wanted
to
do
it
quickly
dorothy
was
saved
the
trouble
of
seeking
her
father
for
at
that
moment
he
entered
the
room
you
are
welcome
father
said
dorothy
in
cold
defiant
tones
you
have
come
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
flickering
flame
of
your
fine
marriage
contract
she
led
him
to
the
fireplace
does
it
not
make
a
beautiful
smoke
and
blaze
did
you
dare
ay
that
i
did
replied
dorothy
you
dared
again
asked
her
father
unable
to
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
ay
so
i
said
that
i
did
again
said
dorothy
by
the
death
of
christ
began
sir
george
now
be
careful
father
about
your
oaths
the
girl
interrupted
you
must
not
forget
the
last
batch
you
made
and
broke
dorothy
words
and
manner
maddened
sir
george
the
expression
of
her
whole
person
from
her
feet
to
her
hair
breathed
defiance
the
poise
of
her
body
and
of
her
limbs
the
wild
glint
in
her
eyes
and
the
turn
of
her
head
all
told
eloquently
that
sir
george
had
no
chance
to
win
and
that
dorothy
was
an
unconquerable
foe
it
is
a
wonder
he
did
not
learn
in
that
one
moment
that
he
could
never
bring
his
daughter
to
marry
lord
stanley
i
will
imprison
you
cried
sir
george
gasping
with
rage
very
well
responded
dorothy
smilingly
you
kept
me
prisoner
for
a
fortnight
i
did
not
ask
you
to
liberate
me
i
am
ready
to
go
back
to
my
apartments
but
now
you
shall
go
to
the
dungeon
her
father
said
ah
the
dungeon
cried
the
girl
as
if
she
were
delighted
at
the
thought
the
dungeon
very
well
again
i
am
ready
to
go
to
the
dungeon
you
may
keep
me
there
the
remainder
of
my
natural
life
i
can
not
prevent
you
from
doing
that
but
you
can
not
force
me
to
marry
lord
stanley
i
will
starve
you
until
you
obey
me
retorted
her
father
i
will
starve
you
that
again
you
may
easily
do
my
dear
father
but
again
i
tell
you
i
will
never
marry
stanley
if
you
think
i
fear
to
die
try
to
kill
me
i
do
not
fear
death
you
have
it
not
in
your
power
to
make
me
fear
you
or
anything
you
can
do
you
may
kill
me
but
i
thank
god
it
requires
my
consent
for
my
marriage
to
stanley
and
i
swear
before
god
that
never
shall
be
given
the
girl
terrible
will
and
calm
determination
staggered
sir
george
and
by
its
force
beat
down
even
his
strong
will
the
infuriated
old
man
wavered
a
moment
and
said
fool
i
seek
only
your
happiness
in
this
marriage
only
your
happiness
why
will
you
not
consent
to
it
i
thought
the
battle
was
over
and
that
dorothy
was
the
victor
she
thought
so
too
but
was
not
great
enough
to
bear
her
triumph
silently
she
kept
on
talking
and
carried
her
attack
too
far
and
i
refuse
to
obey
because
of
my
happiness
i
refuse
because
i
hate
lord
stanley
and
because
as
you
already
know
i
love
another
man
when
she
spoke
the
words
because
i
love
another
man
the
cold
defiant
expression
of
her
face
changed
to
one
of
ecstasy
i
will
have
you
to
the
dungeon
this
very
hour
you
brazen
huzzy
cried
sir
george
how
often
father
shall
i
repeat
that
i
am
ready
to
go
to
the
dungeon
i
am
eager
to
obey
you
in
all
things
save
one
you
shall
have
your
wish
returned
sir
george
would
that
you
had
died
ere
you
had
disgraced
your
house
with
a
dog
whose
name
you
are
ashamed
to
utter
father
there
has
been
no
disgrace
dorothy
answered
and
her
words
bore
the
ring
of
truth
you
have
been
meeting
the
fellow
at
secluded
spots
in
the
forest
how
frequently
you
have
met
him
god
only
knows
and
you
lied
to
me
when
you
were
discovered
at
bowling
green
gate
i
would
do
it
again
gladly
if
i
but
had
the
chance
answered
the
girl
who
by
that
time
was
reckless
of
consequences
but
the
chance
you
shall
not
have
retorted
sir
george
do
not
be
too
sure
father
replied
dorothy
she
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
mystify
him
i
may
see
him
before
another
hour
i
will
lay
you
this
wager
father
if
i
do
not
within
one
hour
see
the
man
the
man
whom
i
love
i
will
marry
lord
stanley
if
i
see
him
within
that
time
you
shall
permit
me
to
marry
him
i
have
seen
him
two
score
times
since
the
day
you
surprised
me
at
the
gate
that
was
a
dangerous
admission
for
the
girl
to
make
and
she
soon
regretted
it
with
all
her
heart
truly
she
was
right
an
angry
brain
is
full
of
blunders
of
course
dorothy
words
which
were
so
full
of
meaning
to
madge
and
me
meant
little
to
sir
george
he
looked
upon
them
only
as
irritating
insolence
on
her
part
a
few
minutes
later
however
they
became
full
of
significance
sir
george
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
stanley
marriage
and
the
burning
of
the
contract
in
his
quarrel
with
dorothy
over
her
unknown
lover
conceive
if
you
can
the
situation
in
haddon
hall
at
that
time
there
was
dorothy
proud
of
the
skill
which
had
enabled
her
to
outwit
her
wrathful
father
there
was
sir
george
whose
mental
condition
inflamed
by
constant
drinking
bordered
on
frenzy
because
he
felt
that
his
child
whom
he
had
so
tenderly
loved
from
the
day
of
her
birth
had
disgraced
herself
with
a
wretch
whom
she
refused
to
name
and
there
under
the
same
roof
lived
the
man
who
was
the
root
and
source
of
all
the
trouble
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
the
wager
father
will
you
take
it
eagerly
asked
dorothy
sir
george
who
thought
that
her
words
were
spoken
only
to
anger
him
waved
her
off
with
his
hands
and
said
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
know
the
wretch
for
whose
sake
you
have
disgraced
yourself
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
soon
know
him
with
certainty
when
i
do
i
will
quickly
have
him
in
my
power
then
i
will
hang
him
to
a
tree
on
bowling
green
and
you
shall
see
the
dog
die
he
is
better
born
than
any
of
our
house
retorted
dorothy
who
had
lost
all
sense
of
caution
ay
he
is
better
born
than
any
with
whom
we
claim
kin
sir
george
stood
in
wonder
and
dorothy
continued
you
can
not
keep
him
from
me
i
shall
see
him
and
i
will
have
him
despite
you
i
tell
you
again
i
have
seen
him
two
score
times
since
you
tried
to
spy
upon
us
at
bowling
green
gate
and
i
will
see
him
whenever
i
choose
and
i
will
wed
him
when
i
am
ready
to
do
so
you
can
not
prevent
it
you
can
only
be
forsworn
oath
upon
oath
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
stop
swearing
sir
george
as
was
usual
with
him
in
those
sad
times
was
inflamed
with
drink
and
dorothy
conduct
i
must
admit
was
maddening
in
the
midst
of
her
taunting
thomas
stepped
into
the
room
bearing
an
armful
of
fagots
sir
george
turned
to
him
and
said
go
and
tell
welch
to
bring
a
set
of
manacles
for
mistress
dorothy
thomas
asked
surprised
into
the
exclamation
curse
you
do
you
mean
to
bandy
words
with
me
you
scum
cried
sir
george
he
snatched
a
fagot
from
john
and
drew
back
his
arm
to
strike
him
john
took
one
step
back
from
sir
george
and
one
step
nearer
to
dorothy
yes
thomas
said
dorothy
sneeringly
bring
welch
with
the
manacles
for
me
my
dear
father
would
put
me
in
the
dungeon
out
of
the
reach
of
other
men
so
that
he
may
keep
me
safely
for
my
unknown
lover
go
thomas
go
else
father
will
again
be
forsworn
before
christ
and
upon
his
knighthood
this
before
a
servant
i
gag
you
you
hellish
vixen
cried
sir
george
then
i
am
sure
he
knew
not
what
he
did
curse
you
he
cried
as
he
held
the
fagot
upraised
and
rushed
upon
dorothy
john
with
his
arms
full
of
fagots
could
not
avert
the
blow
which
certainly
would
have
killed
the
girl
but
he
could
take
it
he
sprang
between
dorothy
and
her
father
the
fagot
fell
upon
his
head
and
he
sank
to
the
floor
in
his
fall
wig
dropped
off
and
when
the
blood
began
to
flow
from
the
wound
dorothy
kneeled
beside
his
prostrate
form
she
snatched
the
great
bush
of
false
beard
from
his
face
and
fell
to
kissing
his
lips
and
his
hands
in
a
paroxysm
of
passionate
love
and
grief
her
kisses
she
knew
to
be
a
panacea
for
all
ills
john
could
be
heir
to
and
she
thought
they
would
heal
even
the
wound
her
father
had
given
and
stop
the
frightful
outpouring
of
john
the
poor
girl
oblivious
of
all
save
her
wounded
lover
murmured
piteously
john
john
speak
to
me
is
dorothy
she
placed
her
lips
near
his
ear
and
whispered
is
dorothy
john
speak
to
her
but
she
received
no
response
then
came
a
wild
light
to
her
eyes
and
she
cried
aloud
john
dorothy
open
your
eyes
speak
to
me
john
oh
for
god
sake
speak
to
me
give
some
little
sign
that
you
live
but
john
was
silent
my
god
my
god
help
help
will
no
one
help
me
save
this
man
see
you
not
that
his
life
is
flowing
away
this
agony
will
kill
me
john
my
lover
my
lord
speak
to
me
ah
his
heart
his
heart
i
will
know
she
tore
from
his
breast
the
leathern
doublet
and
placed
her
ear
over
his
heart
thank
god
it
beats
she
cried
in
a
frenzied
whisper
as
she
kissed
his
breast
and
turned
her
ear
again
to
hear
his
heart
welcome
throbbing
then
she
tried
to
lift
him
in
her
arms
and
succeeded
in
placing
his
head
in
her
lap
it
was
a
piteous
scene
god
save
me
from
witnessing
another
like
it
after
dorothy
lifted
john
head
to
her
lap
he
began
to
breathe
perceptibly
and
the
girl
agitation
passed
away
as
she
gently
stroked
his
hair
and
kissed
him
over
and
over
again
softly
whispering
her
love
to
his
unresponsive
ear
in
a
gentle
frenzy
of
ineffable
tenderness
such
as
was
never
before
seen
in
this
world
i
do
believe
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
were
a
maker
of
pictures
so
that
i
might
draw
for
you
the
scene
which
is
as
clear
and
vivid
in
every
detail
to
my
eyes
now
as
it
was
upon
that
awful
day
in
haddon
hall
there
lay
john
upon
the
floor
and
by
his
side
knelt
dorothy
his
head
was
resting
in
her
lap
over
them
stood
sir
george
with
the
murderous
fagot
raised
as
if
he
intended
again
to
strike
i
had
sprung
to
his
side
and
was
standing
by
him
intending
to
fell
him
to
the
floor
should
he
attempt
to
repeat
the
blow
upon
either
dorothy
or
john
across
from
sir
george
and
me
that
is
upon
the
opposite
side
of
dorothy
and
john
stood
lady
crawford
and
madge
who
clung
to
each
other
in
terror
the
silence
was
heavy
save
when
broken
by
dorothy
sobs
and
whispered
ejaculations
to
john
sir
george
terrible
deed
had
deprived
all
of
us
including
himself
of
the
power
to
speak
i
feared
to
move
from
his
side
lest
he
should
strike
again
after
a
long
agony
of
silence
he
angrily
threw
the
fagot
away
from
him
and
asked
who
is
this
fellow
can
any
one
tell
me
only
madge
dorothy
and
i
could
have
given
him
true
answer
by
some
strange
power
of
divination
madge
had
learned
all
that
had
happened
and
she
knew
as
well
as
i
the
name
of
the
man
who
lay
upon
the
floor
battling
with
death
neither
madge
nor
i
answered
who
is
this
fellow
again
demanded
sir
george
dorothy
lifted
her
face
toward
her
father
he
is
the
man
whom
you
seek
father
she
answered
in
a
low
tearful
voice
he
is
my
lover
he
is
my
life
he
is
my
soul
and
if
you
have
murdered
him
in
your
attempt
to
kill
your
own
child
all
england
shall
hear
of
it
and
you
shall
hang
he
is
worth
more
in
the
eyes
of
the
queen
than
we
and
all
our
kindred
you
know
not
whom
you
have
killed
sir
george
act
had
sobered
him
i
did
not
intend
to
kill
him
in
that
manner
said
sir
george
dropping
his
words
i
hoped
to
hang
him
where
is
dawson
some
one
fetch
dawson
several
of
the
servants
had
gathered
about
the
open
door
in
the
next
room
and
in
obedience
to
sir
george
command
one
of
them
went
to
seek
the
forester
i
feared
that
john
would
die
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
but
i
also
knew
from
experience
that
a
man
head
may
receive
very
hard
knocks
and
life
still
remain
should
john
recover
and
should
sir
george
learn
his
name
i
was
sure
that
my
violent
cousin
would
again
attempt
the
personal
administration
of
justice
and
would
hang
him
under
the
old
saxon
law
in
that
event
parliament
would
not
be
so
easily
pacified
as
upon
the
occasion
of
the
former
hanging
at
haddon
and
i
knew
that
if
john
should
die
by
my
cousin
hand
sir
george
would
pay
for
the
act
with
his
life
and
his
estates
fearing
that
sir
george
might
learn
through
dawson
of
john
identity
i
started
out
in
search
of
will
to
have
a
word
with
him
before
he
could
see
his
master
i
felt
sure
that
for
many
reasons
will
would
be
inclined
to
save
john
but
to
what
extent
his
fidelity
to
the
cause
of
his
master
might
counteract
his
resentment
of
sir
george
act
i
did
not
know
i
suspected
that
dawson
was
privy
to
john
presence
in
haddon
hall
but
i
was
not
sure
of
it
so
i
wished
to
prepare
the
forester
for
his
interview
with
sir
george
and
to
give
him
a
hint
of
my
plans
for
securing
john
safety
in
the
event
he
should
not
die
in
aunt
room
when
i
opened
the
door
in
the
northwest
tower
i
saw
dawson
coming
toward
the
hall
from
the
and
i
hastened
forward
to
meet
him
it
was
pitiful
that
so
good
a
man
as
sir
george
vernon
was
should
have
been
surrounded
in
his
own
house
by
real
friends
who
were
also
traitors
that
was
the
condition
of
affairs
in
haddon
hall
and
i
felt
that
i
was
the
chief
offender
the
evil
however
was
all
of
sir
george
making
tyranny
is
the
father
of
treason
when
i
met
dawson
i
said
will
do
you
know
who
is
the
forester
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
said
well
sir
malcolm
i
suppose
he
is
thomas
no
no
will
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
know
that
he
is
or
perhaps
by
this
time
i
should
say
he
was
sir
john
manners
illustration
was
cried
will
great
god
has
sir
george
discovered
is
he
dead
if
he
is
dead
it
will
be
a
sad
day
for
sir
george
and
for
haddon
hall
tell
me
quickly
i
at
once
knew
will
dawson
was
in
the
secret
i
answered
i
hope
he
is
not
dead
sir
george
attempted
to
strike
dorothy
with
a
fagot
but
thomas
stepped
in
front
of
her
and
received
the
blow
he
is
lying
almost
if
not
quite
dead
in
lady
crawford
room
sir
george
knows
nothing
about
him
save
that
he
is
dorothy
lover
but
should
thomas
revive
i
feel
sure
my
cousin
will
hang
him
in
the
morning
unless
steps
are
taken
to
prevent
the
deed
sir
malcolm
if
you
will
stand
by
me
said
dawson
sir
george
will
not
hang
him
i
certainly
will
stand
by
you
dawson
have
no
doubt
on
that
score
sir
george
intends
to
cast
john
into
the
dungeon
and
should
he
do
so
i
want
you
to
send
jennie
faxton
to
rutland
and
have
her
tell
the
rutlanders
to
rescue
john
morning
i
fear
will
be
too
late
be
on
your
guard
will
do
not
allow
sir
george
to
discover
that
you
have
any
feeling
in
this
matter
above
all
lead
him
from
the
possibility
of
learning
that
thomas
is
sir
john
manners
i
will
contrive
to
admit
the
rutland
men
at
midnight
i
hastened
with
dawson
back
to
the
hall
where
we
found
the
situation
as
i
had
left
it
john
head
was
lying
on
dorothy
lap
and
she
was
trying
to
dress
his
wound
with
pieces
of
linen
torn
from
her
clothing
sir
george
was
pacing
to
and
fro
across
the
room
breaking
forth
at
times
in
curses
against
dorothy
because
of
her
relations
with
a
servant
when
dawson
and
i
entered
the
room
sir
george
spoke
angrily
to
will
who
is
this
fellow
you
employed
him
who
is
he
he
gave
me
his
name
as
thomas
thompson
returned
will
and
he
brought
me
a
favorable
letter
of
recommendation
from
danford
danford
was
forester
to
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
lived
at
chatsworth
there
was
naught
in
the
letter
save
that
he
was
a
good
servant
and
an
honest
man
that
is
all
we
can
ask
of
any
man
but
who
is
he
again
demanded
sir
george
your
worship
may
perhaps
learn
from
danford
more
than
i
can
tell
you
replied
the
forester
adroitly
avoiding
a
lie
think
of
it
malcolm
said
sir
george
speaking
to
me
think
of
it
my
daughter
my
only
child
seeks
for
her
husband
this
serving
man
i
have
always
been
sure
that
the
fellow
would
prove
to
be
such
then
he
turned
to
dawson
throw
the
fellow
into
the
dungeon
if
he
lives
till
morning
i
will
have
him
hanged
to
the
dungeon
with
him
sir
george
waved
his
hand
toward
dawson
and
tom
welch
and
then
stepped
aside
will
made
an
effort
to
hide
his
feelings
and
without
a
word
or
gesture
that
could
betray
him
he
and
welch
lifted
john
to
carry
him
away
then
it
was
piteous
to
see
dorothy
she
clung
to
john
and
begged
that
he
might
be
left
with
her
sir
george
violently
thrust
her
away
from
side
but
she
still
upon
her
knees
grasped
her
father
hand
and
cried
out
in
agony
father
let
me
remain
with
him
if
you
have
ever
felt
love
for
me
and
if
my
love
for
you
has
ever
touched
one
tender
spot
in
your
heart
pity
me
now
and
leave
this
man
with
me
or
let
me
go
with
him
i
beg
you
father
i
plead
i
implore
he
may
be
dying
we
know
not
in
this
hour
of
my
agony
be
merciful
to
me
but
sir
george
rudely
repulsed
her
and
left
the
room
following
welch
and
dawson
who
bore
john
unconscious
form
between
them
dorothy
rose
to
her
feet
screaming
and
tried
to
follow
john
i
fearing
that
in
her
frenzy
of
grief
she
might
divulge
john
name
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
detained
her
by
force
she
turned
upon
me
savagely
and
struck
me
in
her
effort
to
escape
she
called
me
traitor
villain
dog
but
i
lifted
her
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
struggling
to
her
bedroom
i
wanted
to
tell
her
of
the
plans
which
dawson
and
i
had
made
but
i
feared
to
do
so
lest
she
might
in
some
way
betray
them
so
i
left
her
in
the
room
with
lady
crawford
and
madge
i
told
lady
crawford
to
detain
dorothy
at
all
hazards
and
i
whispered
to
madge
asking
her
to
tell
dorothy
that
i
would
look
to
comfort
and
safety
i
then
hastily
followed
sir
george
dawson
and
welch
and
in
a
few
moments
i
saw
them
leave
john
bleeding
and
senseless
upon
the
dungeon
floor
when
sir
george
back
was
turned
dawson
by
my
orders
brought
the
surgeon
from
the
stable
where
he
had
been
working
with
the
horses
the
surgeon
bound
up
the
wound
in
john
head
and
told
me
to
my
great
joy
that
it
was
not
fatal
then
he
administered
a
reviving
potion
and
soon
consciousness
returned
i
whispered
to
john
that
dawson
and
i
would
not
forsake
him
and
fearing
discovery
by
sir
george
hurriedly
left
the
dungeon
i
believe
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
grief
and
sorrow
which
comes
with
every
great
joy
to
give
it
a
cost
mark
whereby
we
may
always
know
its
value
the
love
between
dorothy
and
john
indeed
was
marked
in
plain
figures
of
high
denominations
chapter
xii
the
leicester
possibility
on
leaving
the
dungeon
i
sought
madge
and
after
i
had
whispered
a
word
to
her
from
my
heart
i
asked
her
to
tell
dorothy
the
encouraging
words
of
the
surgeon
and
also
to
tell
her
that
she
should
not
be
angry
with
me
until
she
was
sure
she
had
good
cause
i
dared
not
send
a
more
explicit
message
and
i
dared
not
go
to
dorothy
for
sir
george
was
in
a
suspicious
mood
and
i
feared
ruin
not
only
for
myself
but
for
john
should
my
violent
cousin
suspect
me
of
sympathy
with
his
daughter
and
her
lover
i
also
sought
aunt
dorothy
and
whispered
a
word
to
her
of
which
you
shall
hear
more
presently
ah
i
can
not
do
it
cried
the
trembling
old
lady
in
response
to
my
whispered
request
i
can
not
do
it
but
you
must
aunt
dorothy
i
responded
upon
it
depend
three
lives
sir
george
dorothy
and
her
lover
you
must
do
it
i
will
try
she
replied
that
assurance
will
not
suit
me
i
responded
you
must
promise
upon
your
salvation
that
you
will
not
fail
me
i
promise
upon
my
salvation
replied
aunt
dorothy
that
evening
of
course
we
did
not
see
the
ladies
at
supper
sir
george
and
i
ate
in
silence
until
my
cousin
became
talkative
from
drink
then
he
spoke
bitterly
of
dorothy
conduct
and
bore
with
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
lover
to
whom
dorothy
had
stooped
was
a
serving
man
but
dorothy
declares
he
is
noble
i
responded
she
has
lied
to
me
so
often
that
i
do
not
believe
a
word
she
says
returned
sir
george
he
swore
oath
upon
oath
that
the
wretch
should
hang
in
the
morning
and
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
into
effect
his
intention
he
called
in
joe
the
butcher
and
told
him
to
make
all
things
ready
for
the
execution
i
did
not
attempt
to
thwart
his
purpose
by
word
or
gesture
knowing
it
would
be
useless
but
hoped
that
john
would
be
out
of
his
reach
long
ere
the
cock
would
crow
his
first
greeting
to
the
morrow
sun
after
sir
george
had
drunk
far
into
the
night
the
servants
helped
him
to
bed
and
he
carried
with
him
the
key
to
the
dungeon
together
with
the
keys
to
all
the
outer
doors
and
gates
of
haddon
hall
as
was
his
custom
the
keys
were
in
a
bunch
held
together
by
an
iron
ring
and
sir
george
always
kept
them
under
his
pillow
at
night
i
sought
my
bed
in
eagle
tower
and
lay
down
in
my
clothes
to
rest
and
wait
the
window
of
my
room
was
open
within
an
hour
after
midnight
i
heard
the
hooting
of
an
owl
the
doleful
sound
came
up
to
me
from
the
direction
of
the
stone
footbridge
at
the
southwest
corner
of
the
hall
below
the
chapel
i
went
to
my
window
and
looked
out
over
the
courts
and
terrace
haddon
hall
and
all
things
in
and
about
it
were
wrapped
in
slumbrous
silence
i
waited
and
again
i
heard
the
hooting
of
the
owl
noiselessly
leaving
my
room
i
descended
the
stone
steps
to
an
unused
apartment
in
the
tower
from
which
a
window
opened
upon
the
roof
of
the
north
wing
of
the
hall
along
that
roof
i
crept
with
bared
feet
till
i
reached
another
roof
the
battlements
of
which
at
the
lowest
point
were
not
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
thence
i
clambered
down
to
a
window
cornice
five
or
six
feet
lower
and
jumped
at
the
risk
of
my
limbs
the
remaining
distance
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
to
the
soft
sod
beneath
i
ran
with
all
haste
took
my
stand
under
aunt
window
and
whistled
softly
the
window
casing
opened
and
i
heard
the
great
bunch
of
keys
jingling
and
clinking
against
the
stone
wall
as
aunt
dorothy
paid
them
out
to
me
by
means
of
a
cord
after
i
had
secured
the
keys
i
called
in
a
whisper
to
lady
crawford
and
directed
her
to
leave
the
cord
hanging
from
the
window
i
also
told
her
to
remain
in
readiness
to
draw
up
the
keys
when
they
should
have
served
their
purpose
then
i
took
them
and
ran
to
the
stone
footbridge
where
i
found
four
rutland
men
who
had
come
in
response
to
the
message
dawson
had
sent
by
jennie
faxton
two
of
the
men
went
with
me
and
we
entered
the
lower
garden
by
the
southwest
postern
thence
we
crept
noiselessly
to
the
terrace
and
made
our
entrance
into
the
hall
by
dorothy
postern
i
had
in
my
life
engaged
in
many
questionable
and
dangerous
enterprises
but
this
was
my
first
attempt
at
to
say
that
i
was
nervous
would
but
poorly
define
the
state
of
my
feelings
since
that
day
i
have
respected
the
high
calling
of
burglary
and
regard
with
favor
the
daring
knights
of
the
skeleton
key
i
was
frightened
i
who
would
feel
no
fear
had
i
to
fight
a
dozen
men
trembled
with
fright
during
this
adventure
the
deathlike
silence
and
the
darkness
in
familiar
places
seemed
uncanny
to
me
the
very
chairs
and
tables
appeared
to
be
sleeping
and
i
was
fearful
lest
they
should
awaken
i
can
not
describe
to
you
how
i
was
affected
whether
it
was
fear
or
awe
or
a
smiting
conscience
i
can
not
say
but
my
teeth
chattered
as
if
they
were
in
the
mouth
of
a
fool
and
my
knees
quaked
as
if
they
supported
a
coward
still
i
knew
i
was
doing
my
duty
though
one
conscience
sometimes
smites
him
when
his
reason
tells
him
he
is
acting
righteously
it
is
more
dangerous
to
possess
a
sensitive
conscience
which
can
not
be
made
to
hear
reason
than
to
have
none
at
all
but
i
will
make
short
my
account
of
that
night
doings
the
two
rutland
men
and
i
groped
our
way
to
the
dungeon
and
carried
forth
john
who
was
weak
from
loss
of
blood
i
told
them
to
lock
the
door
of
the
hall
as
they
passed
out
and
to
attach
the
keys
to
the
cord
hanging
from
lady
crawford
window
then
i
climbed
to
my
room
again
feeling
in
conscience
like
a
criminal
because
i
had
done
the
best
act
of
my
life
early
next
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
in
the
upper
court
when
i
looked
out
at
my
window
i
beheld
sir
george
he
was
half
dressed
and
was
angrily
questioning
the
servants
and
retainers
i
knew
that
he
had
discovered
john
escape
but
i
did
not
know
all
nor
did
i
know
the
worst
i
dressed
and
went
to
the
kitchen
where
i
bathed
my
hands
and
face
there
i
learned
that
the
keys
to
the
hall
had
been
stolen
from
under
sir
george
pillow
and
that
the
prisoner
had
escaped
from
the
dungeon
old
bess
the
cook
nodded
her
head
wisely
and
whispered
to
me
the
words
good
for
mistress
doll
bess
unsought
confidence
alarmed
me
i
did
not
relish
the
thought
that
bess
nor
any
one
else
should
believe
me
to
be
in
sympathy
with
dorothy
and
i
said
if
mistress
vernon
had
aught
to
do
with
last
night
affairs
she
should
be
full
of
shame
i
will
not
believe
that
she
knew
of
it
at
all
my
opinion
is
that
one
of
the
servants
was
bribed
by
some
person
interested
in
escape
believe
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
bess
it
is
the
mistress
and
not
the
servant
who
stole
the
keys
and
liberated
but
the
question
is
who
may
be
and
the
servants
hall
is
full
of
it
we
are
not
uncertain
as
to
the
manner
of
his
escape
some
of
the
servants
do
say
that
the
earl
of
leicester
be
now
visiting
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
some
also
do
say
that
his
lordship
be
fond
of
disguises
in
his
gallantry
they
do
also
say
that
the
queen
is
in
love
with
him
and
that
he
must
disguise
himself
when
he
woos
elsewhere
or
she
be
famously
jealous
it
would
be
a
pretty
mess
the
master
has
brought
us
all
into
should
prove
to
be
my
lord
earl
of
leicester
we
all
hang
and
to
hell
bess
that
tongue
of
yours
will
cost
you
your
head
one
of
these
good
times
i
remarked
while
i
rubbed
my
face
with
the
towel
i
would
sooner
lose
my
head
retorted
bess
than
have
my
mouth
shut
by
fear
i
know
sir
malcolm
that
i
not
die
till
my
time
comes
but
please
the
good
god
when
my
time
does
come
i
will
try
to
die
talking
that
you
will
said
i
true
word
sir
malcolm
she
answered
and
i
left
her
in
possession
of
the
field
i
went
into
the
courtyard
and
when
sir
george
saw
me
he
said
malcolm
come
with
me
to
my
room
i
want
a
word
with
you
we
went
to
his
room
i
suppose
you
know
of
the
fellow
escape
last
night
he
said
yes
i
replied
bess
told
me
about
it
in
the
kitchen
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
words
said
i
did
it
not
only
was
the
fellow
liberated
said
my
cousin
but
the
keys
to
all
the
outer
gates
and
doors
of
the
hall
have
been
stolen
and
carried
away
can
you
help
me
unravel
this
affair
do
you
suspect
any
one
of
having
stolen
the
keys
i
asked
i
know
of
course
that
dorothy
did
it
who
her
accomplices
were
if
any
she
had
i
do
not
know
i
have
catechized
the
servants
but
the
question
is
bottomless
to
me
have
you
spoken
to
dorothy
on
the
subject
i
asked
no
he
replied
but
i
have
sent
word
to
her
by
the
faxton
girl
that
i
am
going
to
see
her
at
once
come
with
me
we
went
into
lady
crawford
room
she
was
ill
and
in
bed
i
did
not
wonder
that
she
was
ill
after
the
experiences
of
the
previous
night
sir
george
asked
her
if
she
had
heard
or
seen
dorothy
pass
through
her
room
during
the
night
she
said
dorothy
did
not
pass
through
this
room
last
night
i
did
not
once
close
my
eyes
in
sleep
and
i
should
have
seen
her
had
she
been
here
at
all
sir
george
entered
dorothy
bedroom
and
lady
crawford
beckoned
me
to
go
to
her
side
i
waited
till
sunrise
she
said
that
i
might
draw
up
the
keys
hush
said
i
the
cord
i
burned
it
she
replied
then
i
followed
sir
george
into
dorothy
room
madge
was
dressed
for
the
day
and
dorothy
who
had
been
helping
her
was
making
her
own
toilet
her
hair
hung
loose
and
fell
like
a
cataract
of
sunshine
over
her
bare
shoulders
but
no
words
that
i
can
write
would
give
you
a
conception
of
her
wondrous
beauty
and
i
shall
not
waste
them
in
the
attempt
when
we
entered
the
room
she
was
standing
at
the
mirror
she
turned
comb
in
hand
toward
sir
george
and
said
i
suppose
father
you
will
accuse
me
of
liberating
thomas
you
must
know
that
i
will
accuse
you
replied
sir
george
then
father
for
once
you
will
accuse
me
falsely
i
am
overjoyed
that
he
has
escaped
and
i
certainly
should
have
tried
to
liberate
him
had
i
thought
it
possible
to
do
so
but
i
did
not
do
it
though
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
i
do
not
believe
you
her
father
replied
i
knew
you
would
not
believe
me
answered
dorothy
had
i
liberated
him
i
should
probably
have
lied
to
you
about
it
therefore
i
wonder
not
that
you
should
disbelieve
me
but
i
tell
you
again
upon
my
salvation
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
stealing
of
the
keys
nor
of
escape
believe
me
or
not
i
shall
deny
it
no
more
madge
gropingly
went
to
sir
george
side
and
he
tenderly
put
his
arms
about
her
saying
i
would
that
you
were
my
daughter
madge
took
his
hand
caressingly
uncle
i
want
to
tell
you
that
dorothy
speaks
the
truth
she
said
i
have
been
with
her
every
moment
since
the
terrible
scene
of
yesterday
evening
neither
dorothy
nor
i
closed
our
eyes
in
sleep
all
night
long
she
lay
through
the
dark
hours
moaning
and
i
tried
to
comfort
her
our
door
was
locked
and
it
was
opened
only
by
your
messenger
who
brought
the
good
news
of
escape
i
say
good
news
uncle
because
his
escape
has
saved
you
from
the
stain
of
murder
you
are
too
brave
a
man
to
do
murder
uncle
how
dare
you
said
sir
george
taking
his
arm
from
madge
waist
how
dare
you
defend
now
uncle
i
beg
you
pause
and
take
a
moment
thought
said
madge
interrupting
him
you
have
never
spoken
unkindly
to
me
nor
will
i
madge
so
long
as
i
live
i
know
there
is
not
a
lie
in
you
and
i
am
sure
you
believe
to
be
true
all
you
tell
me
but
dorothy
has
deceived
you
by
some
adroit
trick
if
she
deceived
me
she
is
a
witch
retorted
madge
laughing
softly
that
i
am
almost
ready
to
believe
is
the
case
said
sir
george
dorothy
who
was
combing
her
hair
at
the
mirror
laughed
softly
and
said
my
broomstick
is
under
the
bed
father
sir
george
went
into
lady
crawford
room
and
shut
the
door
leaving
me
with
the
girls
when
her
father
had
left
dorothy
turned
upon
me
with
fire
in
her
eyes
malcolm
vernon
if
you
ever
lay
hands
upon
me
again
as
you
did
last
night
i
will
i
will
scratch
you
you
pretended
to
be
his
friend
and
mine
but
for
a
cowardly
fear
of
my
father
you
came
between
us
and
you
carried
me
to
this
room
by
force
then
you
locked
the
door
and
and
did
not
madge
give
you
my
message
i
asked
interrupting
her
yes
but
did
you
not
force
me
away
from
him
when
through
my
fault
he
was
almost
at
death
door
have
your
own
way
dorothy
i
said
there
lives
not
i
hope
another
woman
in
the
world
so
unreasoning
and
perverse
as
you
she
tossed
her
head
contemptuously
and
continued
to
comb
her
hair
how
suppose
you
i
asked
addressing
dorothy
back
as
if
i
were
seeking
information
how
suppose
you
the
rutland
people
learned
that
john
was
confined
in
the
haddon
dungeon
and
how
did
they
come
by
the
keys
the
girl
turned
for
a
moment
and
a
light
came
to
her
face
as
the
rainbow
steals
across
the
blackened
sky
malcolm
malcolm
she
cried
and
she
ran
to
me
with
her
bare
arms
outstretched
did
you
liberate
him
she
asked
how
did
you
get
the
keys
i
know
nothing
of
it
dorothy
nothing
i
replied
swear
it
malcolm
swear
it
she
said
i
will
swear
to
nothing
i
said
unclasping
her
arms
from
my
neck
then
i
will
kiss
you
she
answered
for
you
are
my
dear
good
brother
and
never
so
long
as
i
live
will
i
again
doubt
you
but
she
did
before
long
doubt
me
again
and
with
good
cause
dorothy
being
in
a
gentle
humor
i
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
warn
her
against
betraying
john
name
to
her
father
i
also
told
her
to
ask
her
father
forgiveness
and
advised
her
to
feign
consent
to
the
stanley
marriage
matters
had
reached
a
point
where
some
remedy
however
desperate
must
be
applied
many
persons
i
fear
will
condemn
me
for
advising
dorothy
to
deceive
her
father
but
what
would
you
have
had
me
do
should
i
have
told
her
to
marry
stanley
certainly
not
had
i
done
so
my
advice
would
have
availed
nothing
should
i
have
advised
her
to
antagonize
her
father
thereby
keeping
alive
his
wrath
bringing
trouble
to
herself
and
bitter
regret
to
him
certainly
not
the
only
course
left
for
me
to
advise
was
the
least
of
three
evils
a
lie
three
evils
must
be
very
great
indeed
when
a
lie
is
the
least
of
them
in
the
vast
army
of
evils
with
which
this
world
swarms
the
lie
usually
occupies
a
proud
position
in
the
front
rank
but
at
times
conditions
arise
when
he
slinks
to
the
rear
and
evils
greater
than
he
take
precedence
in
such
sad
case
i
found
dorothy
and
i
sought
help
from
my
old
enemy
the
lie
dorothy
agreed
with
me
and
consented
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
deceive
her
father
and
what
she
could
not
do
to
that
end
was
not
worth
doing
dorothy
was
anxious
about
john
condition
and
sent
jennie
faxton
to
bowling
green
hoping
a
letter
would
be
there
for
her
jennie
soon
returned
with
a
letter
and
dorothy
once
more
was
full
of
song
for
john
letter
told
her
that
he
was
fairly
well
and
that
he
would
by
some
means
see
her
soon
again
despite
all
opposition
at
our
next
meeting
my
fair
mistress
john
said
in
the
letter
you
must
be
ready
to
come
with
me
i
will
wait
no
longer
for
you
in
fairness
to
me
and
to
yourself
you
shall
not
ask
me
to
wait
i
will
accept
no
more
excuses
you
must
come
with
me
when
next
we
meet
ah
well
said
dorothy
to
madge
if
i
must
go
with
him
i
must
why
did
he
not
talk
in
that
fashion
when
we
rode
out
together
the
last
time
i
like
to
be
made
to
do
what
i
want
to
do
he
was
foolish
not
to
make
me
consent
or
better
still
would
it
have
been
had
he
taken
the
reins
of
my
horse
and
ridden
off
with
me
with
or
against
my
will
i
might
have
screamed
and
i
might
have
fought
him
but
i
could
not
have
hurt
him
and
he
would
have
had
his
way
and
and
with
a
sigh
i
should
have
had
my
way
after
a
brief
pause
devoted
to
thought
she
continued
if
i
were
a
man
and
were
wooing
a
woman
i
would
first
learn
what
she
wanted
to
do
and
then
and
then
by
my
word
i
would
make
her
do
it
i
went
from
dorothy
room
to
breakfast
where
i
found
sir
george
i
took
my
seat
at
the
table
and
he
said
who
in
god
name
suppose
you
could
have
taken
the
keys
from
my
pillow
is
there
any
one
whom
you
suspect
i
asked
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
say
i
at
first
thought
of
course
that
dorothy
had
taken
them
he
answered
but
madge
would
not
lie
neither
would
my
sister
dorothy
would
not
hesitate
to
lie
herself
blue
in
the
face
but
for
some
reason
i
believed
her
when
she
told
me
she
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
her
words
sounded
like
truth
for
once
i
think
sir
george
said
i
you
should
have
left
off
once
dorothy
is
not
a
liar
she
has
spoken
falsely
to
you
only
because
she
fears
you
i
am
sure
that
a
lie
is
hateful
to
her
malcolm
i
wish
i
could
have
your
faith
he
responded
by
the
way
malcolm
have
you
ever
seen
the
earl
of
leicester
i
saw
him
only
once
he
visited
scotland
during
the
ceremonies
at
queen
mary
return
from
france
i
saw
him
once
and
then
but
briefly
why
do
you
ask
it
is
whispered
among
the
servants
said
sir
george
that
leicester
is
at
chatsworth
in
disguise
chatsworth
was
the
home
of
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
was
but
a
short
distance
from
haddon
after
sir
george
spoke
i
remembered
the
words
of
old
bess
still
i
do
not
know
why
you
ask
i
said
my
reason
is
this
replied
sir
george
dorothy
declared
the
fellow
was
of
noble
blood
it
is
said
that
leicester
loves
gallant
adventure
incognito
he
fears
her
majesty
jealousy
if
in
such
matters
he
acts
openly
you
remember
the
sad
case
of
mistress
robsart
i
wonder
what
became
of
the
girl
he
made
way
with
her
in
some
murderous
fashion
i
am
sure
sir
george
remained
in
revery
for
a
moment
and
then
the
poor
old
man
cried
in
tones
of
distress
malcolm
if
that
fellow
whom
i
struck
last
night
was
leicester
and
if
he
has
been
trying
his
hellish
tricks
on
my
doll
i
i
should
pity
her
i
should
not
abuse
her
i
may
have
been
wrong
if
he
has
wronged
doll
if
he
has
wronged
my
girl
i
will
pursue
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
vengeance
that
is
why
i
ask
if
you
have
ever
seen
the
earl
of
leicester
was
the
man
who
lay
upon
the
floor
last
night
robert
dudley
if
it
were
he
and
if
i
had
known
it
i
would
have
beaten
him
to
death
then
and
there
poor
doll
any
one
hearing
the
old
man
speak
would
easily
have
known
that
doll
was
all
that
life
held
for
him
to
love
i
do
not
distinctly
remember
leicester
face
i
answered
but
since
you
speak
of
it
i
believe
there
is
a
resemblance
between
him
and
the
man
we
called
thomas
but
even
were
it
he
sir
george
you
need
have
no
fear
for
dorothy
she
of
all
women
is
able
and
willing
to
protect
herself
i
will
go
to
dorothy
and
ask
her
to
tell
me
the
truth
come
with
me
we
again
went
to
dorothy
room
she
had
since
i
last
saw
her
received
the
letter
from
john
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
when
we
entered
her
parlor
where
she
and
madge
were
eating
breakfast
we
found
her
very
happy
as
a
result
she
was
willing
and
eager
to
act
upon
my
advice
she
rose
and
turned
toward
her
father
you
told
me
doll
that
the
fellow
was
of
noble
blood
did
you
speak
the
truth
yes
father
i
spoke
the
truth
there
is
no
nobler
blood
in
england
than
his
save
that
of
our
royal
queen
in
that
you
may
believe
me
father
for
i
speak
the
truth
sir
george
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
said
if
the
man
is
he
whom
i
believe
him
to
be
he
can
have
no
true
purpose
with
you
tell
me
my
child
the
truth
will
bring
no
reproaches
from
me
tell
me
has
he
misused
you
in
any
way
no
father
before
god
he
has
been
a
true
gentleman
to
me
the
poor
old
man
struggled
for
a
moment
with
his
emotions
then
tears
came
to
his
eyes
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
as
he
started
to
leave
the
room
dorothy
ran
to
him
and
clasped
her
arms
about
his
neck
those
two
father
and
child
were
surely
of
one
blood
as
shown
in
the
storms
of
violence
and
tenderness
by
which
their
natures
were
alternately
swept
father
you
may
believe
me
you
do
believe
me
said
dorothy
furthermore
i
tell
you
that
this
man
has
treated
me
with
all
courtesy
nay
more
he
has
treated
me
with
all
the
reverence
he
would
have
shown
our
queen
he
can
have
no
true
purpose
with
you
doll
said
sir
george
who
felt
sure
that
leicester
was
the
man
but
he
has
father
a
true
purpose
with
me
he
would
make
me
his
wife
would
i
consent
why
then
does
he
not
seek
you
openly
that
he
can
not
do
dorothy
responded
hesitatingly
tell
me
doll
who
is
the
man
asked
sir
george
i
was
standing
behind
him
and
dorothy
face
was
turned
toward
me
she
hesitated
and
i
knew
by
her
expression
that
she
was
about
to
tell
all
sir
george
i
believe
would
have
killed
her
had
she
done
so
i
placed
my
finger
on
my
lips
and
shook
my
head
dorothy
said
that
i
can
not
tell
you
father
you
are
wasting
words
in
asking
me
is
it
because
of
his
wish
that
you
refuse
to
tell
me
his
name
asked
sir
george
i
nodded
my
head
yes
father
softly
responded
dorothy
in
the
old
dangerous
dulcet
tones
that
is
enough
i
know
who
the
man
is
dorothy
kissed
her
father
he
returned
the
caress
much
to
my
surprise
and
left
the
room
when
i
turned
to
follow
sir
george
i
glanced
toward
dorothy
her
eyes
were
like
two
moons
so
full
were
they
of
wonderment
and
inquiry
i
stopped
with
sir
george
in
his
room
he
was
meditative
and
sad
i
believe
my
doll
has
told
me
the
truth
he
said
have
no
doubt
of
it
sir
george
i
replied
but
what
good
intent
can
leicester
have
toward
my
girl
he
asked
of
that
i
can
not
say
i
replied
but
my
dear
cousin
of
this
fact
be
sure
if
he
have
evil
intent
toward
dorothy
he
will
fail
but
there
was
the
robsart
girl
he
replied
ay
said
i
but
dorothy
vernon
is
not
amy
robsart
have
no
fear
of
your
daughter
she
is
proof
against
both
villany
and
craft
had
she
been
in
mistress
robsart
place
leicester
would
not
have
deserted
her
dorothy
is
the
sort
of
woman
men
do
not
desert
what
say
you
to
the
fact
that
leicester
might
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
he
may
purpose
to
do
so
secretly
as
in
the
case
of
the
robsart
girl
returned
sir
george
go
malcolm
and
ask
her
if
he
is
willing
to
make
her
his
wife
before
the
world
i
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
for
a
word
with
dorothy
so
i
hastily
went
to
her
i
told
her
of
the
leicester
phase
of
the
situation
and
i
also
told
her
that
her
father
had
asked
me
if
the
man
whom
she
loved
was
willing
to
make
her
his
wife
before
the
world
tell
my
father
said
she
that
i
will
be
no
man
wife
save
before
all
the
world
a
man
who
will
not
acknowledge
me
never
shall
possess
me
i
went
back
to
sir
george
and
delivered
the
message
word
for
word
she
is
a
strange
strong
girl
is
she
malcolm
said
her
father
she
is
her
father
child
i
replied
by
my
spurs
she
is
she
should
have
been
a
man
said
sir
george
with
a
twinkle
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
he
admired
a
good
fight
even
though
he
were
beaten
in
it
it
is
easy
to
be
good
when
we
are
happy
dorothy
the
great
disturber
was
both
therefore
peace
reigned
once
more
in
haddon
hall
letters
frequently
passed
between
john
and
dorothy
by
the
hand
of
jennie
faxton
but
john
made
no
attempt
to
meet
his
sweetheart
he
and
dorothy
were
biding
their
time
a
fortnight
passed
during
which
cupid
confined
his
operations
to
madge
and
myself
for
her
sweet
sake
he
was
gracious
and
strewed
our
path
with
roses
i
should
delight
to
tell
you
of
our
wooing
she
a
fair
young
creature
of
eighteen
i
a
palpitating
youth
of
i
should
love
to
tell
you
of
madge
promise
to
be
my
wife
and
of
the
announcement
in
the
hall
of
our
betrothal
but
there
was
little
of
interest
in
it
to
any
one
save
ourselves
and
i
fear
lest
you
should
find
it
very
sentimental
and
dull
indeed
i
should
love
to
tell
you
also
of
the
delightful
walks
which
madge
and
i
took
together
along
the
sweet
old
wye
and
upon
the
crest
of
bowling
green
but
above
all
would
i
love
to
tell
you
of
the
delicate
rose
tints
that
came
to
her
cheek
and
how
most
curiously
at
times
when
my
sweetheart
health
was
bounding
the
blessed
light
of
day
would
penetrate
the
darkened
windows
of
her
eyes
and
how
upon
such
occasions
she
would
cry
out
joyously
oh
malcolm
i
can
dimly
see
i
say
i
should
love
to
tell
you
about
all
those
joyous
happenings
but
after
all
i
fear
i
should
shrink
from
doing
so
in
detail
for
the
feelings
and
sayings
of
our
own
hearts
are
sacred
to
us
it
is
much
easier
to
tell
of
the
love
affairs
of
others
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
passed
quietly
in
haddon
hall
sir
george
had
the
notion
firmly
fixed
in
his
head
that
the
man
whom
dorothy
had
been
meeting
held
honorable
intentions
toward
the
girl
he
did
her
the
justice
to
believe
that
by
reason
of
her
strength
and
purity
she
would
tolerate
none
other
at
times
he
felt
sure
that
the
man
was
leicester
and
again
he
flouted
the
thought
as
impossible
if
it
were
leicester
and
if
he
wished
to
marry
dorothy
sir
george
thought
the
match
certainly
would
be
illustrious
halting
between
the
questions
is
he
leicester
and
is
he
not
leicester
sir
george
did
not
press
the
stanley
nuptials
nor
did
he
insist
upon
the
signing
of
the
contract
dorothy
received
from
her
father
full
permission
to
go
where
and
when
she
wished
but
her
willingness
to
give
her
liberty
excited
her
suspicions
she
knew
he
would
permit
her
to
leave
the
hall
only
that
he
might
watch
her
and
if
possible
entrap
her
and
john
therefore
she
rode
out
only
with
madge
and
me
and
sought
no
opportunity
to
see
her
lover
it
may
be
that
her
passiveness
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
she
knew
her
next
meeting
with
john
would
mean
farewell
to
haddon
hall
she
well
knew
she
was
void
of
resistance
when
in
john
hands
and
his
letter
had
told
her
frankly
what
he
would
expect
from
her
when
next
they
should
meet
she
was
eager
to
go
to
him
but
the
old
habit
of
love
for
home
and
its
sweet
associations
and
her
returning
affection
for
her
father
now
that
he
was
kind
to
her
were
strong
cords
entwining
her
tender
heart
which
she
could
not
break
suddenly
even
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
joy
one
day
dorothy
received
from
john
a
letter
telling
her
he
would
on
the
following
morning
start
for
the
scottish
border
with
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
queen
of
scotland
a
plan
had
been
formed
among
mary
friends
in
scotland
to
rescue
her
from
lochleven
castle
where
she
was
a
prisoner
and
to
bring
her
incognito
to
rutland
john
had
been
chosen
to
escort
her
from
the
english
border
to
his
father
castle
from
thence
when
the
opportunity
should
arise
she
was
to
escape
to
france
or
make
her
peace
with
elizabeth
the
adventure
was
full
of
peril
both
for
her
scottish
and
english
friends
the
scottish
regent
murray
surely
would
hang
all
the
conspirators
whom
he
might
capture
and
elizabeth
would
probably
inflict
summary
punishment
upon
any
of
her
subjects
whom
she
could
convict
of
complicity
in
the
plot
in
connection
with
this
scheme
to
rescue
mary
it
was
said
there
was
also
another
conspiracy
there
appeared
to
be
a
plot
within
a
plot
which
had
for
its
end
the
enthronement
of
mary
in
elizabeth
stead
the
rutlands
knew
nothing
of
this
subplot
elizabeth
had
once
or
twice
expressed
sympathy
with
her
scottish
cousin
she
had
said
in
john
presence
that
while
she
could
not
for
reasons
of
state
mary
to
seek
refuge
in
england
still
if
mary
would
come
uninvited
she
would
be
welcomed
therefore
john
thought
he
was
acting
in
accord
with
the
english
queen
secret
wish
when
he
went
to
rutland
with
the
purpose
of
being
in
readiness
to
meet
mary
at
the
scottish
border
there
were
two
elements
in
elizabeth
character
on
which
john
had
not
counted
one
was
her
royal
prerogative
to
speak
words
she
did
not
mean
and
the
other
was
the
universal
feminine
privilege
to
change
her
mind
our
queen
did
not
want
mary
to
visit
england
nor
had
she
any
knowledge
of
the
plot
to
induce
that
event
she
did
however
fear
that
mary
unwise
friends
among
the
catholics
cherished
the
purpose
of
making
mary
queen
of
england
although
john
had
heard
faint
rumors
of
such
a
plot
he
had
been
given
to
understand
that
mary
had
no
share
in
it
and
he
believed
that
the
adventure
in
which
he
was
about
to
embark
had
for
its
only
purpose
her
liberation
from
a
cruel
and
unjust
imprisonment
her
cause
appealed
to
john
chivalrous
nature
as
it
appealed
to
so
many
other
good
though
mistaken
men
who
sought
to
give
help
to
the
scottish
queen
and
brought
only
grief
to
her
and
ruin
to
themselves
dorothy
had
heard
at
various
times
just
enough
of
these
plots
to
fill
her
heart
with
alarm
when
she
learned
that
john
was
about
to
be
engaged
in
them
her
trouble
was
twofold
she
feared
lest
personal
injury
or
death
might
befall
john
and
jealousy
that
shame
of
love
gnawed
at
her
heart
despite
her
efforts
to
drive
it
away
is
she
so
marvellously
beautiful
dorothy
asked
of
me
over
and
over
again
referring
to
mary
stuart
is
she
such
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
fascination
that
all
men
fall
before
her
that
usually
is
the
result
i
replied
i
have
never
known
her
to
smile
upon
a
man
who
did
not
at
once
respond
by
falling
upon
his
knees
to
her
my
reply
certainly
was
not
comforting
ah
then
i
am
lost
she
responded
with
a
tremulous
sigh
is
is
she
prone
to
smile
on
men
and
and
to
grow
fond
of
them
i
should
say
dorothy
that
both
the
smiling
and
the
fondness
have
become
a
habit
with
her
then
she
will
be
sure
to
choose
john
from
among
all
men
he
is
so
glorious
and
perfect
and
beautiful
that
she
will
be
eager
to
to
o
god
i
wish
he
had
not
gone
to
fetch
her
you
need
have
no
fear
i
said
reassuringly
while
mary
stuart
is
marvellously
beautiful
and
fascinating
there
is
at
least
one
woman
who
excels
her
above
all
that
woman
is
pure
and
chaste
who
is
she
that
one
woman
malcolm
who
is
she
asked
the
girl
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
and
looking
at
me
eagerly
with
burning
eyes
you
are
already
a
vain
girl
dorothy
and
i
shall
not
tell
you
who
that
one
woman
is
i
answered
laughingly
no
no
malcolm
i
am
not
vain
in
this
matter
it
is
of
too
great
moment
to
me
for
the
petty
vice
of
vanity
to
have
any
part
in
it
you
do
not
understand
me
i
care
not
for
my
beauty
save
for
his
sake
i
long
to
be
more
beautiful
more
fascinating
and
more
attractive
than
she
than
any
woman
living
only
because
i
long
to
hold
john
to
keep
him
from
her
from
all
others
i
have
seen
so
little
of
the
world
that
i
must
be
sadly
lacking
in
those
arts
which
please
men
and
i
long
to
possess
the
beauty
of
the
angels
and
the
fascinations
of
satan
that
i
may
hold
john
hold
him
hold
him
hold
him
that
i
may
hold
him
so
sure
and
fast
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
to
break
from
me
at
times
i
almost
wish
he
were
blind
then
he
could
see
no
other
woman
ah
am
i
not
a
wicked
selfish
girl
but
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
become
jealous
he
is
all
mine
he
malcolm
she
spoke
with
nervous
energy
and
tears
were
ready
to
spring
from
her
eyes
he
is
all
yours
dorothy
i
answered
all
yours
as
surely
as
that
death
will
some
day
come
to
all
of
us
promise
me
dorothy
that
you
will
never
again
allow
a
jealous
thought
to
enter
your
heart
you
have
no
cause
for
jealousy
nor
will
you
ever
have
if
you
permit
that
hateful
passion
to
take
possession
of
you
it
will
bring
ruin
in
its
wake
it
was
indeed
foolish
in
me
cried
dorothy
springing
to
her
feet
and
clasping
her
hands
tightly
and
i
promise
never
again
to
feel
jealousy
malcolm
its
faintest
touch
tears
and
gnaws
at
my
heart
and
racks
me
with
agony
but
i
will
drive
it
out
of
me
under
its
influence
i
am
not
responsible
for
my
acts
it
would
quickly
turn
me
mad
i
promise
oh
i
swear
that
i
never
will
allow
it
to
come
to
me
again
poor
dorothy
time
of
madness
was
not
far
distant
nor
was
the
evil
that
was
to
follow
in
its
wake
john
in
writing
to
dorothy
concerning
his
journey
to
scotland
had
unhesitatingly
intrusted
to
her
keeping
his
honor
and
unwittingly
his
life
it
did
not
once
occur
to
him
that
she
could
under
any
conditions
betray
him
i
trusted
her
as
john
did
until
i
saw
her
vivid
flash
of
burning
jealousy
but
by
the
light
of
that
flash
i
saw
that
should
the
girl
with
or
without
reason
become
convinced
that
mary
stuart
was
her
rival
she
would
quickly
make
derbyshire
the
warmest
locality
in
christendom
and
john
life
might
pay
the
cost
of
her
folly
dorothy
would
brook
no
rival
no
not
for
a
single
hour
should
she
become
jealous
she
would
at
once
be
swept
beyond
the
influence
of
reason
or
the
care
for
consequences
it
were
safer
to
arouse
a
sleeping
devil
than
dorothy
vernon
jealousy
now
about
the
time
of
john
journey
to
the
scottish
border
two
matters
of
importance
arose
at
haddon
hall
one
bore
directly
upon
dorothy
namely
the
renewal
by
the
stanleys
of
their
suit
for
her
hand
the
other
was
the
announcement
by
the
queen
that
she
would
soon
do
sir
george
vernon
the
honor
of
spending
a
fortnight
under
the
roof
of
haddon
hall
each
event
was
of
great
importance
to
the
king
of
the
peak
he
had
concluded
that
thomas
the
was
not
the
earl
of
leicester
in
disguise
and
when
the
earl
of
derby
again
came
forward
with
his
marriage
project
sir
george
fell
back
into
his
old
hardness
toward
dorothy
and
she
prepared
her
armament
offensive
and
defensive
for
instant
use
if
need
should
arise
i
again
began
my
machinations
since
i
can
call
my
double
dealing
by
no
other
name
i
induced
dorothy
to
agree
to
meet
the
earl
and
his
son
james
without
promising
positively
to
marry
lord
stanley
she
at
my
suggestion
led
her
father
to
believe
she
was
ready
to
yield
to
his
wishes
by
this
course
she
gained
time
and
liberty
and
kept
peace
with
her
father
since
you
have
seen
the
evils
that
war
brought
to
haddon
you
well
know
how
desirable
peace
was
in
time
of
war
all
haddon
was
a
field
of
carnage
and
unrest
in
time
of
peace
the
dear
old
hall
was
an
ideal
home
i
persuaded
sir
george
not
to
insist
on
a
positive
promise
from
dorothy
and
i
advised
him
to
allow
her
yielding
mood
to
grow
upon
her
i
assured
him
evasively
that
she
would
eventually
succumb
to
his
paternal
authority
and
love
what
an
inherent
love
we
all
have
for
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
others
and
what
a
delicious
zest
we
find
in
faithfully
applying
our
surplus
energies
to
business
that
is
not
strictly
our
own
i
had
become
a
part
of
the
sir
affair
and
i
was
like
the
man
who
caught
the
bear
i
could
not
loose
my
hold
chapter
xiii
proud
days
for
the
old
hall
of
course
the
queen
approaching
visit
threw
haddon
hall
into
a
frenzy
of
scrubbing
and
furbishing
aunt
dorothy
was
the
busiest
woman
in
england
floors
were
newly
polished
draperies
were
taken
down
and
were
carefully
washed
with
mysterious
concoctions
warranted
to
remove
dirt
without
injury
to
color
superfine
wax
was
bought
in
great
boxes
and
candles
were
made
for
all
the
chandeliers
and
candelabra
in
the
house
perfumed
oil
was
purchased
for
the
lamp
in
the
state
bedroom
elizabeth
by
the
way
when
she
came
did
not
like
the
odor
of
the
oil
and
with
an
oath
tossed
both
the
oil
and
the
lamp
out
of
the
window
the
fattest
sheep
kine
and
hogs
were
chosen
from
the
flocks
and
were
brought
in
to
be
in
such
numbers
that
one
might
have
supposed
we
were
expecting
an
ogress
who
could
eat
an
ox
at
a
meal
pipers
and
dancers
were
engaged
and
a
merry
fool
was
brought
down
from
london
at
last
the
eventful
day
came
and
with
it
came
our
queen
she
brought
with
her
a
hundred
yeomen
of
her
guard
and
a
score
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
among
the
latter
was
the
earl
of
leicester
who
was
the
queen
prime
favorite
prior
to
the
queen
announcement
of
her
intention
to
visit
haddon
sir
george
had
with
dorothy
tacit
consent
fixed
a
day
upon
which
the
earl
of
derby
and
his
son
lord
james
should
be
received
at
the
hall
for
the
purpose
of
signing
the
marriage
contract
dorothy
of
course
had
no
intention
of
signing
the
contract
but
she
put
off
the
evil
hour
of
refusal
as
far
as
possible
hoping
something
might
occur
in
the
meantime
to
help
her
out
of
the
dilemma
something
did
occur
at
the
last
moment
i
am
eager
to
tell
you
about
it
but
it
must
wait
its
turn
truly
would
the
story
of
this
ingenious
girl
life
make
a
romance
if
it
were
written
by
a
poet
in
her
guinevere
and
elaine
were
moulded
into
one
person
with
the
tenderness
purity
and
fierceness
of
each
to
postpone
further
the
time
of
the
stanley
visit
dorothy
suggested
that
the
betrothal
should
take
place
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
sir
george
acquiesced
and
in
his
heart
grew
less
eager
for
the
stanley
match
as
dorothy
apparently
became
more
tractable
he
was
however
engaged
with
the
earl
to
an
extent
that
forbade
withdrawal
even
had
he
been
sure
that
he
wished
to
withdraw
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
earl
of
leicester
was
the
most
exalted
subject
of
the
realm
he
was
ardently
devoted
to
the
cause
of
the
ladies
and
although
he
had
fixed
his
hope
on
elizabeth
and
longed
for
a
seat
beside
her
on
the
throne
his
inflammable
heart
was
constantly
catching
fire
from
other
eyes
he
of
course
made
desperate
efforts
to
conceal
these
manifold
conflagrations
from
the
queen
but
the
inflammable
tow
of
his
heart
was
always
bringing
him
into
trouble
with
his
fiery
mistress
the
earl
first
glance
toward
dorothy
was
full
of
admiration
the
second
glance
was
full
of
conflagration
the
second
day
of
the
queen
residence
in
haddon
i
was
astonished
grieved
and
angered
to
see
that
our
girl
had
turned
her
powerful
batteries
upon
the
earl
with
the
evident
purpose
of
conquest
at
times
her
long
lashes
would
fall
before
him
and
again
her
great
luminous
eyes
would
open
wide
shedding
a
soft
radiance
which
no
man
could
withstand
once
i
saw
her
walking
alone
with
him
upon
the
terrace
her
head
was
drooped
shamelessly
and
the
earl
was
ardent
though
restless
being
fearful
of
the
queen
i
boiled
with
rage
against
dorothy
but
by
a
strong
effort
i
did
not
boil
over
until
i
had
better
cause
the
better
cause
came
later
i
failed
to
tell
you
of
a
brief
conversation
which
occurred
between
sir
george
and
me
after
my
cousin
first
saw
the
earl
of
leicester
sir
george
had
gallantly
led
the
queen
to
her
apartments
and
i
had
conducted
leicester
and
several
of
the
gentlemen
to
their
various
rooms
sir
george
and
i
met
at
the
staircase
after
we
had
quitted
our
guests
he
said
malcolm
that
fellow
thomas
whom
i
knocked
in
the
head
looked
no
more
like
leicester
than
i
do
why
did
you
tell
me
there
was
resemblance
i
do
not
know
i
answered
perhaps
your
words
suggested
the
thought
of
a
resemblance
perhaps
i
had
lost
all
memory
of
leicester
features
i
can
not
answer
your
question
then
an
expression
of
anger
came
to
sir
george
face
and
he
said
i
believe
dorothy
lied
to
me
when
she
said
that
the
fellow
thomas
was
of
noble
blood
the
next
day
a
servant
reported
that
thomas
had
been
seen
loitering
near
bowling
green
gate
and
sir
george
ordered
dorothy
not
to
leave
the
hall
without
his
permission
dorothy
replied
to
her
father
command
i
shall
obey
you
father
to
me
there
was
a
note
of
danger
in
her
voice
such
docile
submissiveness
was
not
natural
to
the
girl
of
course
all
appearance
of
harshness
toward
dorothy
was
suppressed
by
sir
george
during
the
queen
visit
to
the
hall
in
truth
he
had
no
reason
to
be
harsh
for
dorothy
was
a
meek
submissive
and
obedient
daughter
her
meekness
however
as
you
may
well
surmise
was
but
the
forerunner
of
dire
rebellion
the
fourth
day
of
the
queen
presence
at
haddon
hall
was
the
one
appointed
for
the
visit
of
the
stanleys
and
sir
george
thought
to
make
a
great
event
of
the
betrothal
by
having
the
queen
act
as
a
witness
to
the
marriage
contract
as
the
day
approached
sir
george
became
thoughtful
while
dorothy
grew
gleeful
the
girl
was
frequently
seen
with
leicester
and
sir
george
could
not
help
noticing
that
nobleman
pronounced
admiration
for
his
daughter
these
exhibitions
of
gallantry
were
never
made
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
stanleys
were
expected
sir
george
called
me
to
his
room
for
a
private
consultation
the
old
gentleman
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
not
unmixed
with
perplexity
and
trouble
he
said
i
have
great
and
good
news
to
impart
to
you
malcolm
yet
i
am
in
a
dilemma
growing
out
of
it
tell
me
the
good
news
first
sir
george
i
replied
the
dilemma
may
wait
is
doll
a
very
beautiful
girl
he
asked
eagerly
i
believe
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
i
answered
good
good
he
replied
rubbing
his
hands
is
she
so
fascinating
brilliant
and
attractive
think
you
of
course
i
speak
in
jest
but
think
you
she
might
vie
with
the
court
ladies
for
beauty
and
think
you
she
might
attract
for
the
sake
of
illustration
i
will
say
might
she
attract
a
man
like
leicester
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
i
answered
leicester
is
over
his
ears
in
love
with
the
girl
now
ah
do
you
believe
so
malcolm
replied
sir
george
laughing
and
slapping
his
thigh
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
across
the
room
you
have
seen
so
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
that
you
should
know
it
when
it
comes
under
your
nose
eh
malcolm
eh
i
should
suppose
that
any
one
however
inexperienced
in
such
matters
could
easily
see
leicester
infatuation
for
dorothy
if
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
what
i
really
believe
i
do
i
do
interrupted
sir
george
i
should
say
i
continued
that
dorothy
has
deliberately
gone
in
for
conquest
leave
the
girl
to
herself
sir
george
she
can
conduct
the
campaign
without
help
from
any
one
she
understands
the
art
of
such
warfare
as
well
as
if
she
were
a
veteran
gad
but
she
does
but
she
does
i
believe
she
could
give
venus
herself
some
good
points
in
the
matter
but
let
me
tell
you
malcolm
the
old
man
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
i
questioned
doll
this
morning
and
she
confessed
that
leicester
had
spoken
words
of
love
to
her
would
it
not
be
a
great
match
for
our
house
he
said
our
house
mind
you
not
our
doll
i
might
call
his
condition
of
mind
patrimonial
selfishness
simple
old
man
he
did
not
know
that
words
of
love
are
not
necessarily
words
of
marriage
has
leicester
spoken
to
you
i
asked
in
alarm
for
john
sake
no
no
he
has
not
spoken
returned
my
cousin
for
that
of
course
he
must
have
the
queen
consent
but
he
will
speak
i
am
sure
all
in
good
time
malcolm
all
in
good
time
how
about
the
stanleys
i
asked
they
will
be
here
this
afternoon
that
the
devil
finger
in
the
matter
cried
sir
george
that
where
my
dilemma
lies
how
shall
i
put
them
off
and
still
retain
them
in
case
nothing
should
come
from
leicester
besides
i
am
in
honor
bound
to
the
earl
i
have
a
plan
i
replied
you
carry
out
your
part
of
the
agreement
with
the
earl
but
let
dorothy
at
the
last
moment
refuse
to
give
her
consent
let
her
ask
for
more
time
on
the
plea
that
she
does
not
know
her
mind
i
will
suggest
to
her
if
you
wish
the
part
she
is
to
play
but
i
will
conceal
from
her
the
fact
that
you
are
a
party
to
it
no
said
the
old
man
that
would
be
bad
faith
toward
the
earl
after
a
pause
he
continued
doubtingly
no
do
not
speak
to
doll
i
believe
she
needs
no
suggestions
in
the
matter
i
fear
that
mischief
is
in
her
mind
already
her
easy
acquiescence
in
my
wishes
have
of
late
had
a
suspicious
appearance
no
do
speak
to
her
malcolm
if
ever
there
lived
a
girl
who
could
be
perverse
and
wilful
on
her
own
account
without
help
from
any
one
it
is
my
girl
doll
god
bless
you
man
if
she
but
knew
that
i
wanted
her
to
reject
stanley
she
would
have
him
in
spite
of
hell
itself
i
wonder
what
she
means
by
her
docility
and
obedience
no
do
speak
a
word
to
her
on
the
subject
let
her
believe
i
am
serious
regarding
this
marriage
and
she
will
have
some
plan
of
her
own
to
raise
the
devil
i
have
been
expecting
signs
of
it
every
day
i
had
determined
not
to
bear
with
her
perversity
but
now
that
the
leicester
possibility
has
come
up
we
leave
doll
to
work
out
her
own
salvation
malcolm
do
interfere
no
man
living
can
teach
that
girl
a
new
trick
in
deviltry
gods
malcolm
i
am
curious
to
know
what
she
will
be
doing
for
she
certainly
will
be
doing
something
rather
than
sign
that
contract
of
betrothal
but
suppose
out
of
obedience
to
you
she
should
sign
the
contract
i
asked
malcolm
you
do
know
doll
he
replied
then
after
a
pause
neither
do
i
wish
she
were
well
married
when
i
left
sir
george
i
found
dorothy
in
close
consultation
with
the
queen
and
two
of
her
ladies
i
heard
the
name
of
lord
james
stanley
spoken
amid
suppressed
laughter
and
i
suspected
dorothy
had
on
foot
some
prank
touching
that
young
man
to
which
her
majesty
was
a
party
after
dinner
the
stanleys
came
the
party
consisted
of
father
son
and
four
retainers
who
looked
as
if
they
had
been
preserved
in
alcohol
for
the
occasion
so
red
were
their
faces
the
earl
of
derby
was
a
fine
old
gentleman
of
the
rural
type
his
noble
son
was
an
uncouth
rustic
who
had
no
thought
above
a
stable
boy
or
tavern
maid
nor
any
ambition
above
horse
trading
his
attire
was
a
wonder
to
behold
he
wore
a
ruff
of
stupendous
proportions
his
trunks
were
so
puffed
out
and
preposterous
in
size
that
they
looked
like
a
great
painted
knot
on
a
tree
and
the
splendors
of
his
sleeves
his
hat
his
hose
and
his
shoes
were
dazzling
to
the
eye
add
to
this
wondrous
raiment
feet
and
hands
that
could
not
be
satisfactorily
disposed
of
and
an
unrest
of
manner
painful
to
behold
and
you
may
possibly
conceive
the
grandiose
absurdity
of
dorothy
wooer
the
sight
of
him
almost
made
sir
george
ill
and
his
entrance
into
the
long
gallery
where
the
queen
was
seated
with
her
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
sir
george
and
his
friends
standing
about
her
was
a
signal
for
laughter
in
which
her
majesty
openly
joined
i
shall
not
lead
you
through
the
tedious
ceremony
of
presentation
and
introduction
nor
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
pompous
manner
in
which
one
of
the
earl
retinue
a
lawyer
read
the
marriage
contract
the
fact
that
the
contract
was
read
without
the
presence
of
dorothy
whom
it
so
nearly
concerned
was
significant
of
the
small
consideration
which
at
that
time
was
given
to
a
girl
consent
when
all
was
ready
for
the
signing
dorothy
was
summoned
sir
george
stood
beside
the
stanleys
and
his
nervousness
was
painfully
apparent
two
servants
opened
the
great
doors
at
the
end
of
the
long
gallery
and
dorothy
holding
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
bounded
into
the
room
she
kneeled
to
the
queen
and
turned
toward
her
uncle
stanley
and
her
with
a
low
bow
then
she
courtesied
and
said
good
even
uncle
and
how
do
you
do
cousin
have
you
come
to
inspect
me
and
perchance
to
buy
sir
george
face
bore
an
expression
of
mingled
shame
wonder
and
alarm
and
the
queen
and
her
suite
laughed
behind
their
fans
it
is
well
continued
dorothy
here
am
i
ready
for
inspection
thereupon
she
began
to
disrobe
herself
before
the
entire
company
leicester
laughed
outright
and
the
queen
and
her
ladies
suppressed
their
merriment
for
a
moment
and
then
sent
forth
peals
of
laughter
without
restraint
sir
george
stepped
toward
the
girl
and
raised
his
hand
warningly
but
the
queen
interposed
silence
sir
george
i
command
you
and
sir
george
retreated
to
his
former
place
beside
the
earl
of
derby
dorothy
first
removed
her
bodice
showing
her
shoulders
and
a
part
of
her
arms
clothed
in
the
fashion
of
a
tavern
maid
leicester
who
stood
by
me
whispered
god
never
made
anything
more
beautiful
than
mistress
vernon
arms
sir
george
again
spoke
angrily
doll
what
are
you
doing
but
the
queen
by
a
wave
of
her
hand
commanded
silence
then
the
girl
put
her
hands
behind
her
and
loosened
the
belt
which
held
her
skirt
in
place
the
skirt
fell
to
the
floor
and
out
of
it
bounded
dorothy
in
the
short
gown
of
a
maid
you
will
be
better
able
to
judge
of
me
in
this
costume
cousin
said
dorothy
it
will
be
more
familiar
to
you
than
the
gowns
which
ladies
wear
i
will
retract
said
leicester
whispering
to
me
and
gazing
ardently
at
dorothy
ankles
god
has
made
something
more
beautiful
than
mistress
vernon
arms
by
venus
i
suppose
that
in
his
omnipotence
he
might
be
able
to
create
something
more
beautiful
than
her
ankles
but
up
to
this
time
he
has
not
vouchsafed
to
me
a
vision
of
it
ah
did
any
one
ever
behold
such
strength
such
perfect
symmetry
such
george
the
gypsy
does
live
who
can
dance
like
that
sure
enough
dorothy
was
dancing
the
pipers
in
the
balcony
had
burst
forth
in
a
ribald
jig
of
a
tune
and
the
girl
was
whirling
in
a
wild
weird
and
wondrous
dance
before
her
sir
george
ordered
the
pipers
to
cease
playing
but
again
elizabeth
who
was
filled
with
mirth
interrupted
and
the
music
pealed
forth
in
wanton
volumes
which
flooded
the
gallery
dorothy
danced
like
an
elfin
gypsy
to
the
inspiring
strains
soon
her
dance
changed
to
wondrous
imitations
of
the
movements
of
a
horse
she
walked
sedately
around
in
an
ever
increasing
circle
she
trotted
and
paced
she
gave
the
single
foot
and
racked
she
galloped
slowly
for
a
while
and
then
the
gallop
merged
into
a
furious
run
which
sent
the
blood
of
her
audience
thrilling
through
their
veins
with
delight
the
wondrous
ease
and
grace
and
the
marvellous
strength
and
quickness
of
her
movements
can
not
be
described
i
had
never
before
thought
the
human
body
capable
of
such
grace
and
agility
as
she
displayed
after
her
dance
was
finished
she
stepped
in
front
of
her
cousin
and
delivered
herself
as
follows
i
am
sound
from
ear
tip
to
fetlock
there
is
not
a
blemish
in
me
no
by
my
faith
i
will
swear
there
is
not
cried
the
earl
of
leicester
i
have
good
wind
continued
dorothy
two
good
eyes
by
night
or
by
day
i
can
see
everything
within
the
range
of
my
vision
and
a
great
deal
that
is
not
i
shy
at
times
when
an
uncouth
object
suddenly
comes
upon
me
i
am
warranted
gentle
if
properly
handled
but
otherwise
it
is
unsafe
to
curry
my
heels
sir
george
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
and
again
tried
to
prevent
dorothy
from
proceeding
with
her
terrible
insult
to
the
stanleys
the
queen
however
was
determined
to
see
the
end
of
the
frolic
and
she
said
proceed
mistress
vernon
proceed
dorothy
nothing
loath
continued
as
for
my
disposition
it
might
be
better
it
probably
will
improve
with
age
if
it
does
grow
worse
i
have
all
the
gaits
a
horse
should
have
i
am
four
years
old
i
have
never
been
trained
to
work
double
and
i
think
i
never
shall
be
what
think
you
now
what
have
you
to
offer
in
exchange
step
out
and
let
me
see
you
move
she
took
the
poor
youth
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
how
old
are
you
show
me
your
teeth
she
said
the
heir
to
derby
smiled
uneasily
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
nose
ah
you
have
a
touch
of
the
distemper
i
see
are
you
subject
to
it
stanley
smiled
and
the
earl
said
sir
george
this
insult
has
gone
far
enough
stand
back
my
lord
derby
said
the
queen
do
not
interfere
with
this
interesting
barter
the
earl
reluctantly
lapsed
into
silence
he
remembered
the
insult
of
her
majesty
words
all
his
life
now
step
off
said
dorothy
to
lord
james
the
young
man
stood
in
helpless
confusion
dorothy
took
a
step
backward
from
him
and
after
watching
stanley
a
moment
said
what
you
can
neither
trot
pace
nor
gallop
i
do
believe
you
can
even
walk
alone
then
she
turned
toward
sir
george
a
smile
was
on
her
lips
but
a
look
from
hell
was
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
father
take
a
lesson
from
this
day
i
gave
you
fair
warning
bring
me
no
more
scurvy
cobs
for
barter
nor
trade
then
she
turned
to
the
earl
of
derby
and
to
her
cousin
lord
james
made
a
deep
courtesy
and
said
you
can
have
no
barter
with
me
good
day
she
ran
from
the
room
and
a
great
peal
of
laughter
from
all
save
sir
george
and
the
stanleys
followed
her
as
she
passed
out
through
the
double
door
when
the
laughter
had
subsided
the
earl
of
derby
turned
to
sir
george
and
said
sir
george
this
insult
is
unbearable
and
i
shall
expect
satisfaction
for
it
then
he
turned
to
the
queen
i
beg
that
your
majesty
will
give
me
leave
to
depart
with
my
son
granted
answered
elizabeth
and
father
and
son
started
to
leave
the
room
moving
backward
toward
the
great
doors
sir
george
asked
the
earl
and
lord
stanley
to
remain
and
in
the
presence
of
the
company
who
had
witnessed
the
insult
he
in
the
humblest
manner
made
abject
apology
for
the
treatment
his
distinguished
guests
had
received
at
the
hands
of
his
daughter
he
very
honestly
and
in
all
truth
disclaimed
any
sympathy
with
dorothy
conduct
and
offered
as
the
only
reparation
he
could
make
to
punish
her
in
some
way
befitting
the
offence
then
he
conducted
the
guests
to
the
mounting
block
near
the
entrance
tower
and
saw
them
depart
dorothy
had
solved
her
father
dilemma
with
a
vengeance
sir
george
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
to
be
angry
at
dorothy
though
he
felt
it
was
a
duty
he
owed
to
himself
and
to
the
stanleys
he
had
wished
that
the
girl
would
in
some
manner
defer
the
signing
of
the
contract
but
he
had
not
wanted
her
to
refuse
young
stanley
hand
in
a
manner
so
insulting
that
the
match
would
be
broken
off
altogether
as
the
day
progressed
and
as
sir
george
pondered
over
dorothy
conduct
he
grew
more
inclined
to
anger
but
during
the
afternoon
she
kept
well
under
the
queen
wing
and
he
found
no
opportunity
to
give
vent
to
his
late
that
night
he
called
me
to
his
room
he
had
been
drinking
during
the
evening
and
was
poised
between
hilarity
and
ferocity
the
latter
condition
was
usually
the
result
of
his
libations
when
i
entered
the
room
it
was
evident
he
was
amused
did
you
ever
hear
or
see
such
brazen
effrontery
he
asked
referring
to
dorothy
treatment
of
the
stanleys
is
there
another
girl
on
earth
who
would
have
conceived
the
absurd
thought
or
having
conceived
it
would
have
dared
to
carry
it
out
i
took
a
chair
and
replied
i
think
there
is
not
another
i
hope
not
continued
sir
george
he
sat
in
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
broke
forth
into
a
great
laugh
when
he
had
finished
laughing
he
said
i
admit
it
was
laughable
and
and
pretty
beautiful
damme
i
did
know
the
girl
could
do
it
malcolm
i
did
know
she
had
it
in
her
there
is
not
another
girl
living
could
have
carried
the
frolic
through
then
he
spoke
seriously
but
i
will
make
her
smart
for
it
when
the
queen
leaves
haddon
sir
george
if
you
will
allow
me
to
suggest
what
i
feel
on
the
subject
i
would
say
that
you
have
no
reason
whatever
for
desiring
to
make
dorothy
smart
she
may
have
deeper
designs
than
we
can
see
what
designs
do
you
suppose
she
can
have
tell
me
malcolm
asked
sir
george
i
remained
silent
for
a
moment
hardly
knowing
how
to
express
my
thought
certainly
she
could
not
have
appeared
to
a
better
advantage
than
in
her
tavern
maid
costume
i
said
that
is
true
answered
sir
george
though
she
is
my
own
daughter
i
must
admit
that
i
have
never
seen
any
woman
so
beautiful
as
she
the
old
gentleman
laughed
softly
for
a
moment
and
said
but
was
it
brazen
was
it
shameless
i
have
always
given
the
girl
credit
for
modesty
but
damme
damme
her
beauty
in
the
tavern
maid
costume
fired
leicester
heart
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
i
said
he
stood
by
my
side
and
was
in
raptures
over
her
charms
sir
george
mused
a
moment
and
said
something
about
the
leicester
possibility
which
i
knew
to
be
an
impossibility
and
before
i
left
him
he
had
determined
to
allow
the
matter
to
drop
for
the
present
i
am
making
a
damned
pretty
mess
of
the
whole
affair
i
fear
malcolm
he
said
you
do
seem
to
be
clearing
it
up
sir
george
i
responded
after
talking
over
some
arrangements
for
the
queen
entertainment
i
said
good
night
and
left
my
cousin
brooding
over
as
complicated
a
problem
as
man
ever
tried
to
solve
the
next
morning
i
told
dorothy
how
her
father
felt
with
respect
to
the
leicester
possibility
she
laughed
and
said
i
will
encourage
father
in
that
matter
and
with
a
saucy
twinkle
in
her
eye
incidentally
i
will
not
discourage
my
proud
lord
of
leicester
i
will
make
the
most
of
the
situation
fear
not
malcolm
i
do
not
fear
said
i
emphatically
there
it
was
the
spirit
of
conquest
strong
even
in
a
heart
god
breathed
into
adam
the
breath
of
life
but
into
eve
he
breathed
the
love
of
conquest
and
it
has
been
growing
stronger
in
the
hearts
of
her
daughters
with
each
recurring
generation
how
about
john
i
asked
oh
john
she
answered
throwing
her
head
contemplatively
to
one
side
he
is
amply
able
to
protect
his
own
interests
i
could
not
be
really
untrue
to
him
if
i
wished
to
be
it
is
i
who
am
troubled
on
the
score
of
infidelity
john
will
be
with
the
most
beautiful
queen
she
broke
off
in
the
midst
of
her
sentence
and
her
face
became
clouded
with
an
expression
of
anger
and
hatred
god
curse
her
i
wish
she
were
dead
dead
dead
there
you
know
how
i
feel
toward
your
beauty
curse
the
mongrel
she
halted
before
the
ugly
word
she
was
about
to
use
but
her
eyes
were
like
glowing
embers
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
by
the
heat
of
anger
did
you
not
promise
me
dorothy
that
you
would
not
again
allow
yourself
to
become
jealous
of
queen
mary
i
asked
yes
i
promised
but
i
can
not
prevent
the
jealousy
and
i
do
not
intend
to
try
i
hate
her
and
i
love
to
hate
her
why
should
you
hate
her
i
asked
if
john
remains
true
to
you
there
is
certainly
no
cause
for
you
to
hate
any
one
if
he
should
be
untrue
to
you
you
should
hate
him
hate
him
she
exclaimed
that
indeed
is
pretty
reasoning
if
he
should
be
untrue
to
me
i
should
of
course
hate
her
i
could
not
hate
him
i
did
not
make
myself
love
him
i
would
never
have
been
so
great
a
fool
as
to
bring
that
pain
upon
myself
intentionally
i
suppose
no
girl
would
deliberately
make
herself
love
a
man
and
bring
into
her
heart
so
great
an
agony
i
feel
toward
john
as
i
do
because
i
must
and
i
hate
your
scottish
mongrel
because
i
must
i
tell
you
malcolm
when
she
comes
to
rutland
if
i
hear
of
her
trying
any
of
her
wanton
tricks
on
john
there
will
be
trouble
mark
my
words
i
ask
you
to
promise
me
this
dorothy
that
you
will
do
nothing
concerning
john
and
queen
mary
without
first
speaking
to
me
she
paced
across
the
room
angrily
i
promise
you
nothing
malcolm
save
that
i
shall
not
allow
that
woman
to
come
between
john
and
me
that
i
promise
you
on
my
oath
dorothy
continued
to
shed
her
luminous
smiles
on
leicester
though
she
was
careful
not
to
shine
in
the
queen
presence
my
lord
was
dazzled
by
the
smiles
and
continually
sought
opportunities
to
bask
in
their
dangerous
light
as
a
result
of
this
smiling
and
basking
the
great
london
was
soon
helplessly
caught
in
the
toils
of
doll
the
country
maiden
she
played
him
as
an
angler
plays
a
trout
the
most
experienced
court
coquette
could
not
have
done
the
part
better
than
did
this
girl
whose
knowledge
of
the
subject
was
wholly
intuitive
for
her
life
had
all
been
spent
amid
the
green
hills
and
groves
of
derbyshire
she
so
managed
the
affair
that
her
father
should
see
enough
of
leicester
preference
to
keep
alive
in
sir
george
mind
the
hope
for
the
leicester
possibility
those
words
had
become
with
her
a
phrase
slyly
to
play
upon
one
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
graciously
warm
and
bright
i
induced
madge
to
walk
with
me
upon
the
terrace
that
i
might
for
a
few
moments
feel
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
hear
her
whispered
words
we
took
a
seat
by
a
large
holly
bush
which
effectually
concealed
us
from
view
we
had
been
there
but
a
few
moments
when
we
heard
footsteps
approaching
looking
between
the
branches
of
the
holly
bush
i
saw
dorothy
and
leicester
coming
toward
us
from
the
north
end
of
the
terrace
dorothy
eyes
were
cast
down
demurely
and
her
head
hung
in
the
attitude
of
a
shy
modest
girl
who
listens
timidly
to
words
that
are
music
in
her
ears
never
have
i
seen
an
attitude
more
indicative
of
the
receptive
mood
than
that
which
dorothy
assumed
toward
leicester
ah
thought
i
poor
john
has
given
his
heart
and
has
risked
his
life
for
the
sake
of
doll
and
doll
is
a
miserable
coquette
but
there
was
conduct
still
more
objectionable
to
come
from
dorothy
unconscious
of
our
presence
leicester
said
my
fair
beauty
my
venus
here
is
a
settle
under
this
holly
bush
well
hidden
from
prying
eyes
it
invites
us
will
you
sit
here
with
me
for
one
happy
moment
and
give
me
a
taste
of
paradise
i
fear
i
should
not
sit
with
you
my
lord
however
much
i
may
may
wish
to
do
so
my
father
or
the
queen
might
observe
us
the
black
lashes
fell
upon
the
fair
cheek
and
the
red
golden
head
with
its
crown
of
glory
hung
forward
convincingly
you
false
jade
thought
i
i
ask
for
but
one
moment
pleaded
leicester
the
queen
sleeps
at
this
time
after
dinner
and
perhaps
your
father
would
not
object
if
you
were
to
grant
this
little
favor
to
the
first
nobleman
of
the
realm
you
do
not
know
my
father
my
lord
he
is
very
strict
regarding
my
conduct
murmured
the
drooping
head
i
ask
for
but
one
little
moment
continued
the
earl
in
which
to
tell
you
that
you
have
filled
my
heart
with
adoration
and
love
i
should
not
listen
to
you
my
lord
were
i
mindful
of
my
happiness
i
should
return
to
the
hall
at
once
said
the
drooping
lashes
and
hanging
head
you
lying
wench
thought
i
by
that
time
i
was
thoroughly
angered
only
one
little
moment
on
the
settle
pleaded
leicester
that
i
may
speak
to
you
that
which
i
wish
so
ardently
to
say
can
you
not
speak
while
we
walk
my
lord
asked
dorothy
i
felt
a
bitter
desire
to
curse
the
girl
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
speak
while
we
walk
said
leicester
cautiously
taking
the
girl
hand
so
she
permitted
him
to
lead
her
to
the
settle
under
the
holly
bush
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
madge
and
i
were
sitting
the
earl
retained
the
hand
for
a
moment
after
he
and
dorothy
were
seated
but
she
gently
drew
it
away
and
moved
a
little
distance
from
his
lordship
still
her
eyes
were
drooped
her
head
hung
low
and
her
bosom
actually
heaved
as
if
with
emotion
i
will
tell
john
of
your
shamelessness
i
said
to
myself
he
shall
feel
no
more
heartaches
for
you
you
wanton
huzzy
then
leicester
poured
forth
his
passion
most
eloquently
poesy
verse
and
rhetoric
all
came
to
help
him
in
his
wooing
now
and
then
the
girl
would
respond
to
his
ardor
with
please
my
lord
or
i
pray
you
my
lord
and
when
he
would
try
to
take
her
hand
she
would
say
i
beg
you
my
lord
do
not
but
leicester
evidently
thought
that
the
do
not
meant
do
for
soon
he
began
to
steal
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
she
was
so
slow
in
stopping
him
that
i
thought
she
was
going
to
submit
she
however
arose
gently
to
her
feet
and
said
my
lord
i
must
return
to
the
hall
i
may
not
longer
remain
here
with
you
the
earl
caught
her
hand
and
endeavored
to
kiss
it
but
she
adroitly
prevented
him
and
stepping
out
into
the
path
started
slowly
toward
the
hall
she
turned
her
head
slightly
toward
leicester
in
a
mute
but
eloquent
invitation
and
he
quickly
followed
her
i
watched
the
pair
walk
up
the
terrace
they
descended
the
steps
to
the
garden
and
from
thence
they
entered
the
hall
by
way
of
the
porch
was
it
not
very
wicked
in
dorothy
to
listen
to
such
words
from
leicester
asked
madge
i
do
not
at
all
understand
her
madge
of
course
knew
only
a
part
of
what
had
happened
and
a
very
small
part
at
that
for
she
had
not
seen
dorothy
madge
and
i
returned
to
the
hall
and
we
went
at
once
to
dorothy
room
hoping
to
see
her
and
intending
to
tell
her
our
opinion
of
the
shameless
manner
in
which
she
had
acted
dorothy
was
in
her
room
alone
when
we
entered
she
clapped
her
hands
ran
to
the
door
bolted
it
and
bounded
back
toward
us
i
have
the
greatest
news
to
tell
you
she
cried
laughingly
the
greatest
news
and
the
greatest
sport
of
which
you
ever
heard
my
lord
leicester
is
in
love
with
me
indeed
that
is
very
fine
i
responded
but
my
irony
met
its
usual
fate
she
did
not
see
it
yes
continued
dorothy
brimming
over
with
mirth
you
should
have
heard
him
pleading
with
me
a
few
moments
since
upon
the
terrace
we
did
hear
him
said
madge
you
heard
him
where
how
her
eyes
were
wide
with
wonder
we
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
holly
bush
from
you
i
answered
we
heard
him
and
we
saw
you
did
you
good
i
am
glad
of
it
said
dorothy
yes
we
saw
and
we
heard
all
and
we
think
that
your
conduct
was
shameless
i
responded
severely
shameless
demanded
dorothy
now
pray
tell
me
what
i
did
or
said
that
was
i
was
at
a
loss
to
define
the
wrong
in
her
conduct
for
it
had
been
of
an
intangible
quality
which
in
itself
was
nothing
but
notwithstanding
meant
a
great
deal
you
permitted
him
to
hold
your
hand
i
said
trying
to
fix
on
something
real
with
which
to
accuse
her
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
said
dorothy
laughingly
he
caught
my
hand
several
times
but
i
withdrew
it
from
him
i
knew
she
spoke
the
truth
regarding
her
hand
so
i
tried
again
you
you
hung
your
head
and
kept
your
eyes
cast
down
and
you
looked
oh
i
hung
my
head
i
cast
down
my
eyes
and
i
looked
she
answered
laughing
heartily
pray
let
me
ask
you
master
for
what
use
else
are
heads
and
eyes
made
i
was
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
uses
to
which
dorothy
had
put
her
head
and
eyes
were
not
some
of
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
created
they
are
good
purposes
too
i
admit
although
i
would
not
have
conceded
as
much
to
dorothy
i
knew
the
girl
would
soon
wheedle
me
into
her
way
of
thinking
so
i
took
a
bold
stand
and
said
it
is
my
intention
to
tell
john
about
your
conduct
with
leicester
and
i
shall
learn
for
what
purpose
he
thinks
eyes
and
heads
are
created
tell
john
cried
dorothy
of
course
you
may
tell
john
he
well
knows
the
purposes
of
heads
and
eyes
and
their
proper
uses
he
has
told
me
many
times
his
opinion
on
the
subject
she
laughed
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
i
too
shall
tell
john
all
that
happened
or
shall
happen
between
lord
leicester
and
me
i
wish
i
could
tell
him
now
how
i
wish
i
could
tell
him
now
a
soft
light
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
repeated
huskily
if
i
might
tell
him
now
if
i
might
tell
him
now
why
malcolm
i
despise
leicester
he
is
a
poor
weak
fool
he
has
no
more
force
nor
strength
than
i
have
he
is
not
a
man
he
is
no
more
attractive
than
a
woman
he
wanted
to
kiss
me
he
begged
me
to
give
him
but
one
it
is
but
a
poor
kiss
which
a
man
gets
by
begging
think
you
i
would
give
him
one
had
he
but
touched
my
lips
think
you
i
would
ever
allow
john
to
soil
himself
again
by
kissing
them
fear
not
malcolm
fear
not
for
john
nor
for
me
no
man
will
ever
receive
from
me
a
favor
the
granting
of
which
would
make
me
unfit
to
be
john
john
wife
i
have
paid
too
dearly
for
him
to
throw
him
away
for
a
penny
whistle
that
i
do
not
want
then
she
grew
earnest
with
a
touch
of
anger
leicester
what
reason
suppose
you
malcolm
have
i
for
treating
him
as
i
do
think
you
i
act
from
sheer
wantonness
if
there
were
one
little
spot
of
that
fault
upon
my
soul
i
would
tear
myself
from
john
though
i
should
die
for
it
her
laughing
mood
had
passed
away
and
i
feared
to
say
that
i
could
see
no
reason
other
than
coquetry
for
her
conduct
i
feared
the
tigress
would
scratch
my
eyes
out
i
have
wanted
to
see
you
she
continued
that
i
might
tell
you
of
my
plans
and
of
the
way
they
are
working
out
but
now
since
you
have
spoken
to
me
in
this
manner
sir
malcolm
françois
de
lorraine
vernon
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
you
suspect
me
therefore
you
shall
wait
with
the
rest
of
the
world
to
learn
my
purposes
you
may
tell
john
all
you
have
seen
and
heard
i
care
not
how
quickly
you
do
it
then
with
a
sigh
i
pray
god
it
may
be
very
soon
he
will
wish
for
no
explanation
and
he
shall
one
day
have
in
me
a
rich
reward
for
his
faith
do
you
trust
him
as
he
trusts
you
i
asked
and
would
you
demand
an
explanation
were
he
to
act
toward
mary
stuart
as
you
have
acted
toward
leicester
he
could
not
act
toward
her
as
i
did
toward
lord
leicester
she
said
thoughtfully
then
after
a
moment
she
laughingly
continued
john
ca
he
ca
hang
his
head
and
droop
his
eyes
and
look
but
if
i
began
i
want
no
more
of
your
hellish
cried
the
girl
in
sudden
fury
if
john
were
to
to
look
at
that
scottish
mongrel
as
i
looked
at
leicester
i
would
i
would
kill
the
royal
wanton
i
would
kill
her
if
it
cost
my
life
now
for
god
sake
leave
me
you
see
the
state
into
which
you
have
wrought
me
i
left
madge
with
dorothy
and
walked
out
upon
bowling
green
to
ponder
on
the
events
that
were
passing
before
me
from
the
time
we
learned
that
john
had
gone
to
fetch
the
scottish
queen
i
had
fears
lest
dorothy
inflammable
jealousy
might
cause
trouble
and
now
those
fears
were
rapidly
transforming
themselves
into
a
feeling
of
certainty
there
is
nothing
in
life
so
sweet
and
so
dangerous
as
the
love
of
a
woman
i
soon
saw
dorothy
again
tell
me
said
i
in
conciliation
tell
me
please
what
is
your
reason
for
acting
as
you
do
toward
leicester
and
why
should
you
look
differently
upon
similar
conduct
on
john
part
i
will
not
tell
you
my
plans
she
responded
not
now
at
least
perhaps
i
shall
do
so
when
i
have
recovered
from
my
it
is
hard
for
me
to
give
my
reasons
for
feeling
differently
about
like
conduct
on
john
part
perhaps
i
feel
as
i
do
because
because
it
is
this
way
while
i
might
do
little
things
mere
nothings
such
as
i
have
done
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
do
any
act
of
unfaithfulness
to
john
oh
it
could
not
be
but
with
him
he
he
well
he
is
a
man
and
and
oh
talk
to
me
do
talk
to
me
you
are
driving
me
mad
out
of
my
sight
out
of
my
room
holy
virgin
i
shall
die
before
i
have
him
i
know
i
shall
there
it
was
again
the
thought
of
mary
stuart
drove
her
wild
dorothy
threw
herself
on
her
face
upon
the
bed
and
madge
went
over
and
sat
by
her
side
to
soothe
her
i
with
a
feeling
of
guilt
so
adroit
had
been
dorothy
defence
left
the
girls
and
went
to
my
room
in
the
tower
to
unravel
by
the
help
of
my
pipe
the
tangled
web
of
incomprehensibility
i
failed
as
many
another
man
had
failed
before
me
and
as
men
will
continue
to
fail
to
the
end
of
time
chapter
xiv
mary
stuart
and
now
i
come
to
an
event
in
this
history
which
i
find
difficult
to
place
before
you
in
its
true
light
for
dorothy
sake
i
wish
i
might
omit
it
altogether
but
in
true
justice
to
her
and
for
the
purpose
of
making
you
see
clearly
the
enormity
of
her
fault
and
the
palliating
excuses
therefor
if
any
there
were
i
shall
pause
briefly
to
show
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
about
to
write
a
time
when
dorothy
madness
brought
us
to
the
most
terrible
straits
and
plunged
us
into
deepest
tribulations
although
i
have
been
unable
to
show
you
as
much
of
john
as
i
have
wished
you
to
see
you
nevertheless
must
know
that
he
whose
nature
was
not
like
the
shallow
brook
but
was
rather
of
the
quality
of
a
deep
river
had
caught
from
dorothy
an
infection
of
love
from
which
he
would
never
recover
his
soul
was
steeped
in
the
delicious
essence
of
the
girl
i
would
also
call
your
attention
to
the
conditions
under
which
his
passion
for
dorothy
had
arisen
it
is
true
he
received
the
shaft
when
first
he
saw
her
at
the
royal
arms
in
but
the
shaft
had
come
from
eyes
afterward
she
certainly
had
done
her
full
part
in
the
wooing
it
was
for
her
sake
after
she
had
drawn
him
on
to
love
her
that
he
became
a
servant
in
haddon
hall
for
her
sake
he
faced
death
at
the
hands
of
her
father
and
it
was
through
her
mad
fault
that
the
evil
came
upon
him
of
which
i
shall
now
tell
you
that
she
paid
for
her
fault
in
suffering
does
not
excuse
her
since
pain
is
but
the
latter
half
of
evil
during
the
term
of
elizabeth
residence
in
haddon
hall
john
returned
to
rutland
with
queen
mary
stuart
whose
escape
from
lochleven
had
excited
all
england
the
country
was
full
of
rumors
that
mary
was
coming
to
england
not
so
much
for
sanctuary
as
to
be
on
the
ground
ready
to
accept
the
english
crown
when
her
opportunity
to
do
so
should
occur
the
catholics
a
large
and
powerful
party
flushed
with
their
triumphs
under
the
bloody
queen
were
believed
to
sympathize
with
mary
cause
although
elizabeth
said
little
on
the
subject
she
felt
deeply
and
she
feared
trouble
should
the
scottish
queen
enter
her
dominion
another
cause
of
annoyance
to
elizabeth
was
the
memory
that
leicester
had
once
been
deeply
impressed
with
mary
charms
and
had
sought
her
hand
in
marriage
elizabeth
prohibition
alone
had
prevented
the
match
that
thought
rankled
in
elizabeth
heart
and
she
hated
mary
although
her
hatred
as
in
all
other
cases
was
tempered
with
justice
and
mercy
this
great
queen
had
the
brain
of
a
man
with
its
motives
and
the
heart
of
a
woman
with
its
emotions
when
news
of
mary
escape
reached
london
cecil
came
in
great
haste
to
haddon
during
a
consultation
with
elizabeth
he
advised
her
to
seize
mary
should
she
enter
england
and
to
check
the
plots
made
in
mary
behalf
by
executing
the
principal
friends
of
the
scottish
queen
he
insistently
demanded
that
elizabeth
should
keep
mary
under
lock
and
key
should
she
be
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
possession
of
her
person
and
that
the
men
who
were
instrumental
in
bringing
her
into
england
should
be
arraigned
for
high
treason
john
certainly
had
been
instrumental
in
bringing
her
into
england
and
if
cecil
advice
were
taken
by
the
queen
john
head
would
pay
the
forfeit
for
his
chivalric
help
to
mary
elizabeth
was
loath
to
act
on
this
advice
but
cecil
worked
upon
her
fears
and
jealousies
until
her
mind
and
her
heart
were
in
accord
and
she
gave
secret
orders
that
his
advice
should
be
carried
out
troops
were
sent
to
the
scottish
border
to
watch
for
the
coming
of
the
fugitive
queen
but
mary
was
already
ensconced
safely
as
she
thought
in
rutland
castle
under
the
assumed
name
of
lady
blanche
her
presence
at
rutland
was
of
course
guarded
as
a
great
secret
dorothy
mind
dwelt
frequently
upon
the
fact
that
john
and
the
beautiful
young
scottish
queen
lived
under
the
same
roof
for
john
had
written
to
dorothy
immediately
after
his
return
nothing
so
propagates
itself
as
jealousy
there
were
in
haddon
hall
two
hearts
in
which
this
process
was
rapidly
progressing
elizabeth
and
dorothy
each
had
for
the
cause
of
her
jealousy
the
same
woman
one
night
soon
after
cecil
had
obtained
from
elizabeth
the
order
for
mary
arrest
dorothy
on
retiring
to
her
room
at
a
late
hour
found
jennie
faxton
waiting
for
her
with
a
precious
letter
from
john
dorothy
drank
in
the
tenderness
of
john
letter
as
the
thirsty
earth
absorbs
the
rain
but
her
joy
was
neutralized
by
frequent
references
to
the
woman
who
she
feared
might
become
her
rival
of
what
she
feared
she
was
sure
had
been
accomplished
that
is
mary
half
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
the
young
queen
would
certainly
grow
fond
of
john
that
was
a
foregone
conclusion
no
woman
could
be
with
him
and
escape
that
fate
thought
dorothy
her
hope
as
to
the
other
half
john
part
rested
solely
upon
her
faith
in
john
which
was
really
great
and
her
confidence
in
her
own
charms
and
in
her
own
power
to
hold
him
which
in
truth
and
with
good
reason
was
not
small
dorothy
went
to
bed
and
jennie
following
her
usual
custom
when
at
haddon
lay
upon
the
floor
in
the
same
room
letter
with
all
its
tenderness
had
thrown
dorothy
into
an
inquisitive
frame
of
mind
after
an
hour
or
two
of
restless
tossing
upon
the
bed
she
fell
asleep
but
soon
after
midnight
she
awakened
and
in
her
drowsy
condition
the
devil
himself
played
upon
the
strings
of
her
imagination
after
a
time
she
sprang
from
the
bed
lighted
a
candle
at
the
rush
light
and
read
john
letter
in
a
tremor
of
fear
then
she
aroused
jennie
faxton
and
asked
when
were
you
at
rutland
i
spent
yesterday
and
there
mistress
answered
jennie
did
you
see
a
strange
lady
asked
dorothy
oh
yes
mistress
i
did
see
her
three
or
four
times
answered
jennie
lady
blanche
is
her
name
and
she
be
a
cousin
of
sir
john
she
do
come
they
say
from
france
and
do
speak
only
in
the
tongue
of
that
country
i
i
suppose
that
this
this
lady
blanche
and
and
sir
john
are
very
good
friends
did
you
did
you
often
see
them
together
asked
dorothy
she
felt
guilty
in
questioning
jennie
for
the
purpose
of
spying
upon
her
lover
she
knew
that
john
would
not
pry
into
her
conduct
indeed
yes
mistress
returned
jennie
who
admired
john
greatly
from
her
lowly
sphere
and
who
for
her
own
sake
as
well
as
dorothy
was
jealous
of
queen
mary
they
do
walk
together
a
great
deal
on
the
ramparts
and
the
white
snaky
lady
do
look
up
into
sir
john
face
like
this
here
jennie
assumed
a
lovelorn
expression
and
and
once
mistress
i
thought
i
thought
yes
yes
jesu
hissed
dorothy
clutching
jennie
by
the
arm
you
thought
you
thought
tell
me
tell
me
what
in
hell
name
did
you
think
speak
quickly
wench
i
be
not
sure
mistress
but
i
thought
i
saw
his
arm
about
her
waist
one
evening
on
the
ramparts
it
was
dark
and
for
sure
i
could
not
tell
but
god
curse
upon
the
white
huzzy
screamed
dorothy
god
curse
upon
her
she
is
stealing
him
from
me
and
i
am
helpless
she
clasped
her
hands
over
the
top
of
her
head
and
ran
to
and
fro
across
the
room
uttering
inarticulate
cries
of
agony
then
she
sat
upon
the
bedside
and
threw
herself
into
madge
arms
crying
under
her
breath
my
god
my
god
think
of
it
madge
i
have
given
him
my
heart
my
soul
o
merciful
god
my
love
all
that
i
have
worth
giving
and
now
comes
this
white
wretch
and
because
she
is
a
queen
and
was
sired
in
hell
she
tries
to
steal
him
from
me
and
coaxes
him
to
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
do
feel
that
way
about
it
dorothy
said
madge
soothingly
i
know
sir
john
can
explain
it
all
to
you
when
you
see
him
he
is
true
to
you
i
am
sure
true
to
me
madge
how
can
he
be
true
to
me
if
she
coaxes
him
to
woo
her
and
if
he
puts
his
arm

losing
him
i
know
it
i
i
o
god
madge
i
am
smothering
i
am
strangling
holy
virgin
i
believe
i
am
about
to
die
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
by
madge
side
clutching
her
throat
and
breast
and
her
grand
woman
form
tossed
and
struggled
as
if
she
were
in
convulsions
holy
mother
she
cried
take
this
frightful
agony
from
my
breast
snatch
this
terrible
love
from
my
heart
god
if
you
have
pity
give
it
now
help
me
help
me
ah
how
deeply
i
love
i
never
loved
him
so
much
as
i
do
at
this
awful
moment
save
me
from
doing
that
which
is
in
my
heart
if
i
could
have
him
for
only
one
little
portion
of
a
minute
but
that
is
denied
me
whose
right
it
is
and
is
given
to
her
who
has
no
right
ah
god
is
not
just
if
he
were
he
would
strike
her
dead
i
hate
her
and
i
hate
hate
him
she
arose
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
held
out
her
arms
toward
madge
madge
she
continued
frenzied
by
the
thought
his
arm
was
around
her
waist
that
was
early
in
the
evening
holy
virgin
what
may
be
happening
now
dorothy
sprang
from
the
bed
and
staggered
about
the
room
with
her
hands
upon
her
throbbing
temples
i
can
not
bear
this
agony
god
give
me
strength
soon
she
began
to
gasp
for
breath
i
can
see
them
now
together
together
i
hate
her
i
hate
him
my
love
has
turned
bitter
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
i
will
do
it
i
will
i
will
disturb
their
sweet
rest
if
i
can
not
have
him
she
shall
not
i
tell
the
queen
i
tell
the
queen
dorothy
acted
on
her
resolution
the
moment
it
was
taken
and
at
once
began
to
unbolt
the
door
stay
dorothy
stay
cried
madge
think
on
what
you
are
about
to
do
it
will
cost
john
his
life
come
to
me
for
one
moment
dorothy
i
pray
you
madge
arose
from
the
bed
and
began
groping
her
way
toward
dorothy
who
was
unbolting
the
door
madge
could
have
calmed
the
sea
as
easily
as
she
could
have
induced
dorothy
to
pause
in
her
mad
frenzy
jennie
faxton
almost
paralyzed
by
fear
of
the
storm
she
had
raised
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
room
trembling
and
speechless
dorothy
was
out
of
the
room
before
poor
blind
madge
could
reach
her
the
frenzied
girl
was
dressed
only
in
her
night
robes
and
her
glorious
hair
hung
dishevelled
down
to
her
waist
she
ran
through
the
rooms
of
lady
crawford
and
those
occupied
by
her
father
and
the
retainers
then
she
sped
down
the
long
gallery
and
up
the
steps
to
elizabeth
apartment
she
knocked
violently
at
the
queen
door
who
comes
demanded
one
of
her
majesty
ladies
i
dorothy
was
the
response
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
majesty
at
once
upon
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
her
elizabeth
ordered
her
ladies
to
admit
dorothy
and
the
girl
ran
to
the
queen
who
had
half
arisen
in
her
bed
you
must
have
affairs
of
great
moment
indeed
cried
elizabeth
testily
if
they
induce
you
to
disturb
me
in
this
manner
of
great
moment
indeed
your
majesty
replied
dorothy
endeavoring
to
be
calm
of
moment
to
you
and
to
me
mary
stuart
is
in
england
at
this
instant
trying
to
steal
your
crown
and
my
lover
she
is
now
sleeping
within
five
leagues
of
this
place
god
only
knows
what
she
is
doing
let
us
waste
no
time
your
majesty
the
girl
was
growing
wilder
every
second
let
us
go
you
and
i
and
seize
this
wanton
creature
you
to
save
your
crown
i
to
save
my
lover
and
my
life
where
is
she
demanded
elizabeth
sharply
cease
prattling
about
your
lover
she
would
steal
both
my
lover
and
my
crown
if
she
could
where
is
she
she
is
at
rutland
castle
your
majesty
answered
dorothy
ah
the
duke
of
rutland
and
his
son
john
said
elizabeth
i
have
been
warned
of
them
send
for
my
lord
cecil
and
sir
william
st
loe
sir
william
was
in
command
of
the
yeoman
guards
is
sir
john
manners
your
lover
asked
elizabeth
turning
to
dorothy
yes
answered
the
girl
you
may
soon
seek
another
replied
the
queen
significantly
her
majesty
words
seemed
to
awaken
dorothy
from
her
stupor
of
frenzy
and
she
foresaw
the
result
of
her
act
then
came
upon
her
a
reaction
worse
than
death
you
may
depart
said
the
queen
to
dorothy
and
the
girl
went
back
to
her
room
hardly
conscious
that
she
was
moving
at
times
we
can
not
help
feeling
that
love
came
to
the
human
breast
through
a
drop
of
venom
shot
from
the
serpent
tongue
into
the
heart
of
eve
again
we
believe
it
to
be
a
spark
from
god
own
soul
who
will
solve
me
this
riddle
soon
the
hard
cold
ringing
of
arms
and
the
tramp
of
mailed
feet
resounded
through
haddon
hall
and
the
din
reached
room
in
the
tones
of
a
clanging
knell
there
seemed
to
be
a
frightful
rhythm
in
the
chaos
of
sounds
which
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
words
john
will
die
john
will
die
though
the
full
import
of
her
act
and
its
results
did
nor
for
a
little
time
entirely
penetrate
her
consciousness
she
remembered
the
queen
words
you
may
soon
seek
another
elizabeth
plainly
meant
that
john
was
a
traitor
and
that
john
would
die
for
his
treason
the
clanking
words
john
will
die
john
will
die
bore
upon
the
girl
ears
in
ever
increasing
volume
until
the
agony
she
suffered
deadened
her
power
to
think
she
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
room
trying
to
collect
her
senses
but
her
mind
was
a
blank
after
a
few
minutes
she
ran
back
to
the
queen
having
an
undefined
purpose
of
doing
something
to
avert
the
consequences
of
her
mad
act
she
at
first
thought
to
tell
the
queen
that
the
information
she
had
given
concerning
mary
stuart
presence
in
rutland
was
false
but
she
well
knew
that
a
lie
seldom
succeeds
and
in
this
case
even
through
her
clouded
mentality
she
could
see
that
a
lie
would
surely
fail
she
determined
to
beg
the
queen
to
spare
john
life
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
she
would
do
but
she
hoped
by
the
time
she
should
reach
the
queen
room
to
hit
upon
some
plan
that
would
save
him
when
she
knocked
at
elizabeth
door
it
was
locked
against
her
her
majesty
was
in
consultation
with
cecil
sir
william
loe
and
a
few
other
gentlemen
among
whom
was
sir
george
vernon
dorothy
well
knew
there
was
no
help
for
john
if
her
father
were
of
the
queen
council
she
insisted
upon
seeing
the
queen
but
was
rudely
repulsed
by
the
time
she
again
reached
her
room
full
consciousness
had
returned
and
agony
such
as
she
had
never
before
dreamed
of
overwhelmed
her
soul
many
of
us
have
felt
the
same
sort
of
pain
when
awakened
suddenly
to
the
fact
that
words
we
have
spoken
easily
may
not
by
our
utmost
efforts
be
recalled
though
we
would
gladly
give
our
life
itself
to
have
them
back
if
suffering
can
atone
for
sin
dorothy
bought
her
indulgence
within
one
hour
after
sinning
but
suffering
can
not
atone
for
sin
it
is
only
a
part
of
it
the
result
arise
madge
and
dress
said
dorothy
gently
i
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
i
have
committed
a
frightful
crime
i
have
betrayed
john
to
death
ah
help
me
madge
if
you
can
pray
god
to
help
me
he
will
listen
to
you
i
fear
to
pray
to
him
he
would
turn
my
prayers
to
curses
i
am
lost
she
fell
for
a
moment
upon
the
bed
and
placed
her
head
on
breast
murmuring
if
i
could
but
die
all
may
turn
out
better
than
it
now
appears
said
madge
quiet
yourself
and
let
us
consider
what
may
be
done
to
arrest
the
evil
of
your
your
act
nothing
can
be
done
nothing
wailed
dorothy
as
she
arose
from
the
bed
and
began
to
dress
please
arise
madge
and
dress
yourself
here
are
your
garments
and
your
gown
they
hastily
dressed
without
speaking
and
dorothy
began
again
to
pace
the
floor
he
will
die
hating
me
said
dorothy
if
he
could
live
i
willingly
would
give
him
to
the
the
scottish
woman
then
i
could
die
and
my
suffering
would
cease
i
must
have
been
mad
when
i
went
to
the
queen
he
trusted
me
with
his
honor
and
his
life
and
i
traitress
that
i
am
have
betrayed
both
ah
well
when
he
dies
i
also
shall
die
there
is
comfort
at
least
in
that
thought
how
helpless
i
am
she
could
not
weep
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
not
a
tear
in
her
all
was
hard
dry
burning
agony
she
again
fell
upon
the
bed
and
moaned
piteously
for
a
little
time
wringing
her
hands
and
uttering
frantic
ejaculatory
prayers
for
help
my
mind
seems
to
have
forsaken
me
she
said
hoarsely
to
madge
i
can
not
think
what
noise
is
that
she
paused
and
listened
for
a
moment
then
she
went
to
the
north
window
and
opened
the
casement
the
yeoman
guards
from
bakewell
are
coming
she
said
i
recognize
them
by
the
light
of
their
flambeaux
they
are
entering
the
gate
at
the
a
part
of
the
queen
guard
had
been
quartered
in
the
village
of
bakewell
dorothy
stood
at
the
window
for
a
moment
and
said
the
other
guards
are
here
under
our
window
and
are
ready
to
march
to
rutland
there
is
lord
cecil
and
sir
william
loe
and
malcolm
and
there
is
my
father
now
they
are
off
to
meet
the
other
yeomen
at
the
the
stable
boys
are
lighting
their
torches
and
flambeaux
they
are
going
to
murder
john
and
i
have
sent
them
dorothy
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
slowly
walked
to
and
fro
across
the
room
call
malcolm
said
madge
perhaps
he
can
help
us
lead
me
to
the
window
dorothy
and
i
will
call
him
dorothy
led
madge
to
the
window
and
above
the
din
of
arms
i
heard
her
soft
voice
calling
malcolm
malcolm
the
order
to
march
had
been
given
before
madge
called
but
i
sought
sir
william
and
told
him
i
would
return
to
the
hall
to
get
another
sword
and
would
soon
overtake
him
on
the
road
to
rutland
i
then
hastened
to
dorothy
room
i
was
ignorant
of
the
means
whereby
elizabeth
had
learned
of
mary
presence
at
rutland
the
queen
had
told
no
one
how
the
information
reached
her
the
fact
that
mary
was
in
england
was
all
sufficient
for
cecil
and
he
proceeded
to
execute
the
order
elizabeth
had
given
for
mary
arrest
without
asking
or
desiring
any
explanation
i
of
course
was
in
great
distress
for
john
sake
since
i
knew
that
he
would
be
attainted
of
treason
i
had
sought
in
vain
some
plan
whereby
i
might
help
him
but
found
none
i
myself
being
a
scottish
refugee
occupied
no
safe
position
and
my
slightest
act
toward
helping
john
or
mary
would
be
construed
against
me
when
i
entered
dorothy
room
she
ran
to
me
and
said
can
you
help
me
malcolm
can
you
help
me
save
him
from
this
terrible
evil
which
i
have
brought
upon
him
how
did
you
bring
the
evil
upon
him
i
asked
in
astonishment
it
was
not
your
fault
that
he
brought
mary
stuart
to
no
no
she
answered
but
i
told
the
queen
she
was
at
rutland
you
told
the
queen
i
exclaimed
unwilling
to
believe
my
ears
you
told
how
why
why
did
you
tell
her
i
do
not
know
why
i
told
her
she
replied
i
was
mad
with
with
jealousy
you
warned
me
against
it
but
i
did
not
heed
you
jennie
faxton
told
me
that
she
saw
john
and
but
all
that
does
not
matter
now
i
will
tell
you
hereafter
if
i
live
what
we
must
now
do
is
to
save
him
to
save
him
if
we
can
try
to
devise
some
plan
think
think
malcolm
my
first
thought
was
to
ride
to
rutland
castle
and
give
the
alarm
sir
george
would
lead
the
yeomen
thither
by
the
shortest
route
the
road
by
way
of
rowsley
there
was
another
route
leading
up
the
lathkil
through
the
dale
and
thence
by
a
road
turning
southward
to
rutland
that
road
was
longer
by
a
league
than
the
one
sir
george
would
take
but
i
could
put
my
horse
to
his
greatest
speed
and
i
might
be
able
to
reach
the
castle
in
time
to
enable
john
and
mary
to
escape
i
considered
the
question
a
moment
my
own
life
certainly
would
pay
the
forfeit
in
case
of
failure
but
my
love
for
john
and
i
confess
it
with
shame
the
memory
of
my
old
tenderness
for
mary
impelled
me
to
take
the
risk
i
explained
the
plan
upon
which
i
was
thinking
and
told
them
of
my
determination
when
i
did
so
madge
grasped
me
by
the
arm
to
detain
me
and
dorothy
fell
upon
her
knees
and
kissed
my
hand
i
said
i
must
start
at
once
for
ride
as
i
may
i
fear
the
yeomen
will
reach
rutland
gates
before
i
can
get
there
but
if
the
guards
should
be
at
the
gates
when
you
arrive
or
if
you
should
be
missed
by
cecil
you
a
scottish
refugee
and
a
friend
of
queen
mary
would
be
suspected
of
treason
and
you
would
lose
your
life
said
madge
who
was
filled
with
alarm
for
my
sake
that
is
true
i
replied
but
i
can
think
of
no
other
way
whereby
john
can
possibly
be
saved
dorothy
stood
for
a
moment
in
deep
thought
and
said
i
will
ride
to
rutland
by
way
of
lathkil
dale
i
will
ride
in
place
of
you
malcolm
it
is
my
duty
and
my
privilege
to
do
this
if
i
can
i
saw
the
truth
of
her
words
and
felt
that
since
dorothy
had
wrought
the
evil
it
was
clearly
her
duty
to
remedy
it
if
she
could
if
she
should
fail
no
evil
consequences
would
fall
upon
her
if
i
should
fail
it
would
cost
me
my
life
and
while
i
desired
to
save
john
still
i
wished
to
save
myself
though
my
conduct
may
not
have
been
chivalric
still
i
was
willing
that
dorothy
should
go
in
my
place
and
i
told
her
so
i
offered
to
ride
with
her
as
far
as
a
certain
a
league
distant
from
rutland
castle
there
i
would
leave
her
and
go
across
the
country
to
meet
the
yeomen
on
the
road
they
had
taken
i
could
join
them
before
they
reached
rutland
and
my
absence
during
the
earlier
portion
of
the
march
would
not
be
remarked
or
if
noticed
it
could
easily
be
explained
this
plan
was
agreed
upon
and
after
the
guards
had
passed
out
at
gate
and
were
well
down
toward
rowsley
i
rode
out
from
the
hall
and
waited
for
dorothy
at
an
appointed
spot
near
overhaddon
immediately
after
my
departure
dolcy
was
saddled
and
soon
dorothy
rode
furiously
up
to
me
away
we
sped
dorothy
and
i
by
yulegrave
church
down
into
the
dale
and
up
the
river
never
shall
i
forget
that
mad
ride
heavy
rains
had
recently
fallen
and
the
road
in
places
was
almost
impassable
the
rivers
were
in
flood
but
when
dorothy
and
i
reached
the
ford
the
girl
did
not
stop
to
consider
the
danger
ahead
of
her
i
heard
her
whisper
on
dolcy
on
and
i
heard
the
sharp
whisp
of
the
whip
as
she
struck
the
trembling
fearful
mare
and
urged
her
into
the
dark
flood
dolcy
hesitated
but
dorothy
struck
her
again
and
again
with
the
whip
and
softly
cried
on
dolcy
on
then
mare
and
rider
plunged
into
the
swollen
river
and
i
of
course
followed
them
the
water
was
so
deep
that
our
horses
were
compelled
to
swim
and
when
we
reached
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
we
had
drifted
with
the
current
a
distance
of
at
least
three
hundred
yards
below
the
road
we
climbed
the
cliff
by
a
sheep
path
how
dorothy
did
it
i
do
not
know
and
how
i
succeeded
in
following
her
i
know
even
less
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
dorothy
started
off
at
full
gallop
leading
the
way
and
again
i
followed
the
sheep
path
leading
up
the
river
to
the
road
followed
close
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
a
false
step
by
the
horse
would
mean
death
to
both
horse
and
rider
but
dorothy
feared
not
or
knew
not
the
danger
and
i
caught
her
ever
whispered
cry
on
dolcy
on
on
dolcy
on
ashamed
to
fall
behind
yet
fearing
to
ride
at
such
a
pace
on
such
a
path
i
urged
my
horse
forward
he
was
a
fine
strong
mettlesome
brute
and
i
succeeded
in
keeping
the
girl
dim
form
in
sight
the
moon
which
was
rapidly
sinking
westward
still
gave
us
light
through
rifts
in
the
black
bank
of
floating
clouds
else
that
ride
over
the
sheep
path
by
the
cliff
would
have
been
our
last
journey
in
the
flesh
soon
we
reached
the
main
road
turning
southward
it
was
a
series
of
rough
rocks
and
mudholes
and
dorothy
and
dolcy
shot
forward
upon
it
with
the
speed
of
the
tempest
to
undo
if
possible
the
evil
which
a
dozen
words
untimely
spoken
had
wrought
i
urged
my
horse
until
his
head
was
close
by
dolcy
tail
and
ever
and
anon
could
i
hear
the
whispered
cry
on
dolcy
on
on
dolcy
sweet
dolcy
good
dolcy
on
my
pet
on
no
word
was
spoken
between
dorothy
and
me
but
i
could
hear
dolcy
panting
with
her
mighty
effort
and
amid
the
noise
of
splashing
water
and
the
thud
thud
thud
of
our
horses
hoofs
came
always
back
to
me
from
dorothy
lips
the
sad
sad
cry
full
of
agony
and
longing
on
dolcy
on
on
dolcy
on
the
road
we
took
led
us
over
steep
hills
and
down
through
dark
ravines
but
up
hill
down
hill
and
on
the
level
the
terrible
girl
before
me
plunged
forward
with
unabated
headlong
fury
until
i
thought
surely
the
flesh
of
horse
man
and
woman
could
endure
the
strain
not
one
moment
longer
but
the
horses
the
woman
and
though
i
say
it
who
should
not
the
man
were
of
god
best
handiwork
and
the
cords
of
our
lives
did
not
snap
one
thought
and
only
one
held
possession
of
the
girl
and
the
matter
of
her
own
life
or
death
had
no
place
in
her
mind
when
we
reached
the
where
i
was
to
leave
her
we
halted
while
i
instructed
dorothy
concerning
the
road
she
should
follow
from
that
point
to
rutland
and
directed
her
how
to
proceed
when
she
should
arrive
at
the
castle
gate
she
eagerly
listened
for
a
moment
or
two
then
grew
impatient
and
told
me
to
hasten
in
my
speech
since
there
was
no
time
to
lose
then
she
fearlessly
dashed
away
alone
into
the
black
night
and
as
i
watched
her
fair
form
fade
into
the
shadows
the
haunting
cry
came
faintly
back
to
me
on
dolcy
on
on
dolcy
on
and
i
was
sick
at
heart
i
was
loath
to
leave
her
thus
in
the
inky
gloom
the
moon
had
sunk
for
the
night
and
the
clouds
had
banked
up
without
a
rift
against
the
hidden
stars
but
i
could
give
her
no
further
help
and
my
life
would
pay
the
forfeit
should
i
accompany
her
she
had
brought
the
evil
upon
herself
she
was
the
iron
the
seed
the
cloud
and
the
rain
she
was
fulfilling
her
destiny
she
was
doing
that
which
she
must
do
nothing
more
nothing
less
she
was
filling
her
little
niche
in
the
universal
moment
she
was
a
part
of
the
infinite
kaleidoscope
a
fragile
piece
of
glass
which
might
be
crushed
to
atoms
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
in
the
sounding
of
a
trump
after
leaving
dorothy
i
rode
across
the
country
and
soon
overtook
the
yeoman
guard
whom
i
joined
unobserved
then
i
marched
with
them
all
too
rapidly
to
suit
me
to
rutland
the
little
army
had
travelled
with
greater
speed
than
i
had
expected
and
i
soon
began
to
fear
that
dorothy
would
not
reach
rutland
castle
in
time
to
enable
its
inmates
to
escape
within
half
an
hour
from
the
time
i
joined
the
yeomen
we
saw
the
dim
outlines
of
the
castle
and
sir
william
loe
gave
the
command
to
hurry
forward
cecil
sir
william
sir
george
and
myself
rode
in
advance
of
the
column
as
we
approached
the
castle
by
the
road
leading
directly
to
the
gate
from
the
north
i
saw
for
a
moment
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
west
of
the
castle
gate
the
forms
of
dorothy
and
dolcy
in
dim
silhouette
against
the
sky
then
i
saw
them
plunge
madly
down
the
hill
toward
the
gate
i
fancied
i
could
hear
the
girl
whispering
in
frenzied
hoarseness
on
dolcy
on
and
i
thought
i
could
catch
the
panting
of
the
mare
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
less
than
one
hundred
yards
from
the
gate
poor
dolcy
unable
to
take
another
step
dropped
to
the
ground
dolcy
had
gone
on
to
her
death
she
had
filled
her
little
niche
in
the
universe
and
had
died
at
her
post
dorothy
plunged
forward
over
the
mare
head
and
a
cry
of
alarm
came
from
my
lips
despite
me
i
was
sure
the
girl
had
been
killed
she
however
instantly
sprang
to
her
feet
her
hair
was
flying
behind
her
and
she
ran
toward
the
gate
crying
john
john
fly
for
your
life
and
then
she
fell
prone
upon
the
ground
and
did
not
rise
we
had
all
seen
the
mare
fall
and
had
seen
the
girl
run
forward
toward
the
gates
and
fall
before
reaching
them
cecil
and
sir
william
rode
to
the
spot
where
dorothy
lay
and
dismounted
in
a
moment
sir
william
called
to
sir
george
the
lady
is
your
daughter
mistress
dorothy
what
in
hell
name
brings
her
here
cried
sir
george
hurriedly
riding
forward
and
how
came
she
i
followed
speedily
and
the
piteous
sight
filled
my
eyes
with
tears
i
can
not
describe
it
adequately
to
you
though
i
shall
see
it
vividly
to
the
end
of
my
days
dorothy
had
received
a
slight
wound
upon
the
temple
and
blood
was
trickling
down
her
face
upon
her
neck
and
ruff
her
hair
had
fallen
from
its
fastenings
she
had
lost
her
hat
and
her
gown
was
torn
in
shreds
and
covered
with
mud
i
lifted
the
girl
to
her
feet
and
supported
her
then
with
my
kerchief
i
bound
up
the
wound
upon
her
temple
poor
dolcy
she
said
almost
incoherently
i
have
killed
her
and
i
have
failed
i
have
failed
now
i
am
ready
to
die
would
that
i
had
died
with
dolcy
let
me
lie
down
here
malcolm
let
me
lie
down
i
still
held
her
in
my
arms
and
supported
her
form
why
are
you
here
demanded
sir
george
to
die
responded
dorothy
to
die
damned
nonsense
returned
her
father
how
came
you
here
you
fool
on
dolcy
she
is
dead
returned
dorothy
were
you
not
at
haddon
when
we
left
there
asked
her
father
yes
she
replied
did
you
pass
us
on
the
road
he
asked
how
came
you
here
sir
george
insisted
oh
i
flew
hither
i
am
a
witch
do
question
me
father
i
am
in
no
temper
to
listen
to
you
i
warn
you
once
and
for
all
keep
away
from
me
beware
of
me
i
have
a
dagger
in
my
bosom
go
and
do
the
work
you
came
to
do
but
remember
this
father
if
harm
comes
to
him
i
will
take
my
own
life
and
my
blood
shall
be
upon
your
soul
my
god
malcolm
what
does
she
mean
asked
sir
george
touched
with
fear
by
the
strength
of
his
daughter
threat
has
she
lost
her
wits
no
the
girl
quickly
responded
i
have
only
just
found
them
sir
george
continued
to
question
dorothy
but
he
received
no
further
response
from
her
she
simply
held
up
the
palm
of
her
hand
warningly
toward
him
and
the
gesture
was
as
eloquent
as
an
oration
she
leaned
against
me
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
while
her
form
shook
and
trembled
as
if
with
a
palsy
cecil
and
sir
william
loe
then
went
toward
the
gate
and
sir
george
said
to
me
i
must
go
with
them
you
remain
with
doll
and
see
that
she
is
taken
home
procure
a
horse
for
her
if
she
is
unable
to
ride
make
a
litter
or
perhaps
there
is
a
coach
in
the
castle
if
so
take
possession
of
it
take
her
home
by
some
means
when
we
return
what
think
you
could
have
brought
her
here
i
evaded
the
question
by
replying
i
will
probably
be
able
to
get
a
coach
in
the
castle
sir
george
leave
dorothy
with
me
soon
by
the
command
of
sir
william
the
yeomen
rode
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
for
the
purpose
of
surrounding
the
castle
and
then
i
heard
cecil
at
the
gates
demanding
open
in
the
name
of
the
queen
let
us
go
to
the
gates
said
dorothy
that
we
may
hear
what
they
say
and
see
what
they
do
will
they
kill
him
here
think
you
she
asked
looking
wildly
into
my
face
the
flambeaux
on
the
castle
gate
and
those
which
the
had
brought
with
them
from
haddon
were
lighted
and
the
scene
in
front
of
the
gate
was
all
aglow
no
no
my
sweet
one
i
answered
perhaps
they
will
not
kill
him
at
all
certainly
they
will
not
kill
him
now
they
must
try
him
first
i
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
going
to
the
gates
but
she
insisted
and
i
helped
her
to
walk
forward
when
dorothy
and
i
reached
the
gates
we
found
that
cecil
and
lord
rutland
were
holding
a
consultation
through
the
the
portcullis
was
still
down
and
the
gates
were
closed
but
soon
the
portcullis
was
raised
a
postern
was
opened
from
within
and
sir
william
entered
the
castle
with
two
score
of
the
yeomen
guards
sir
george
approached
and
again
plied
dorothy
with
questions
but
she
would
not
speak
one
would
have
thought
from
her
attitude
that
she
was
deaf
and
dumb
she
seemed
unconscious
of
her
father
presence
she
has
lost
her
mind
said
sir
george
in
tones
of
deep
trouble
and
i
know
not
what
to
do
leave
her
with
me
for
a
time
cousin
i
am
sure
she
will
be
better
if
we
do
not
question
her
now
then
dorothy
seemed
to
awaken
malcolm
is
right
father
leave
me
for
a
time
i
pray
you
sir
george
left
us
and
waited
with
a
party
of
yeomen
a
short
distance
from
the
gate
for
the
return
of
sir
william
with
his
prisoners
dorothy
and
i
sat
upon
a
stone
bench
near
the
postern
through
which
sir
william
and
the
guardsmen
had
entered
but
neither
of
us
spoke
after
a
long
weary
time
of
waiting
sir
william
came
out
of
the
castle
through
the
postern
and
with
him
came
mary
stuart
my
heart
jumped
when
i
saw
her
in
the
glare
of
the
flambeaux
and
the
spirit
of
my
dead
love
for
her
came
begging
admission
to
my
heart
i
can
not
describe
my
sensations
when
i
beheld
her
but
this
i
knew
that
my
love
for
her
was
dead
past
resurrection
following
mary
came
lord
rutland
and
immediately
following
his
lordship
walked
john
when
he
stepped
through
the
postern
dorothy
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
to
him
with
a
cry
john
john
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
stepped
toward
her
with
evident
intent
to
embrace
her
his
act
was
probably
the
result
of
an
involuntary
impulse
for
he
stopped
before
he
reached
the
girl
illustration
sir
george
had
gone
at
sir
william
request
to
arrange
the
guards
for
the
return
march
dorothy
and
john
were
standing
within
two
yards
of
each
other
do
not
touch
me
cried
dorothy
save
to
strike
me
if
you
will
the
evil
which
has
come
upon
you
is
of
my
doing
i
betrayed
you
to
the
queen
i
saw
mary
turn
quickly
toward
the
girl
when
she
uttered
those
words
i
was
insane
when
i
did
it
continued
dorothy
they
will
take
your
life
john
but
when
you
die
i
also
shall
die
it
is
a
poor
reparation
i
know
but
it
is
the
only
one
i
can
make
i
do
not
understand
you
dorothy
said
john
why
should
you
betray
me
i
can
not
tell
you
she
answered
all
i
know
is
that
i
did
betray
you
and
i
hardly
know
how
i
did
it
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
like
a
fearful
monster
of
the
night
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
explain
i
betrayed
you
and
now
i
suffer
for
it
more
a
than
you
can
possibly
suffer
i
offer
no
excuse
i
have
none
i
simply
betrayed
you
and
ask
only
that
i
may
die
with
you
then
was
manifest
in
john
heart
the
noblest
quality
which
god
has
given
to
man
charity
strengthened
by
reason
his
face
glowed
with
a
light
that
seemed
saintlike
and
a
grand
look
of
ineffable
love
and
pity
came
to
his
eyes
he
seemed
as
if
by
inspiration
to
understand
all
that
dorothy
had
felt
and
done
and
he
knew
that
if
she
had
betrayed
him
she
had
done
it
at
a
time
when
she
was
not
responsible
for
her
acts
he
stepped
quickly
to
the
girl
side
and
caring
naught
that
we
all
should
see
him
caught
her
to
his
breast
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
the
light
of
the
flambeaux
fell
upon
her
upturned
face
dorothy
he
said
it
matters
not
what
you
have
done
you
are
my
only
love
i
ask
no
explanation
if
you
have
betrayed
me
to
death
though
i
hope
it
will
not
come
to
that
evil
you
did
not
do
it
because
you
did
not
love
me
no
no
john
you
know
that
sobbed
the
girl
i
do
know
it
dorothy
i
know
all
that
i
wish
to
know
you
would
not
intentionally
bring
evil
upon
me
while
you
love
me
ah
that
i
do
john
only
god
knows
how
deeply
how
desperately
my
love
was
the
cause
my
love
was
my
curse
it
was
your
curse
do
not
weep
dorothy
said
john
interrupting
her
i
would
that
i
could
take
all
your
suffering
upon
myself
do
not
weep
dorothy
buried
her
face
upon
his
breast
and
tears
came
to
her
relief
she
was
not
alone
in
her
weeping
for
there
stood
i
like
a
very
woman
and
by
my
side
stood
rough
old
sir
william
tears
were
coursing
down
the
bronzed
cheek
of
the
grand
old
warrior
like
drops
of
glistening
dew
upon
the
harrowed
face
of
a
mountain
rock
when
i
saw
sir
william
tears
i
could
no
longer
restrain
my
emotions
and
i
frankly
tell
you
that
i
made
a
spectacle
of
myself
in
full
view
of
the
queen
yeoman
guard
sir
george
approached
our
little
group
and
when
he
saw
dorothy
in
arms
he
broke
forth
into
oaths
and
stepped
toward
her
intending
to
force
her
away
but
john
held
up
the
palm
of
his
free
hand
warningly
toward
sir
george
and
drawing
the
girl
drooping
form
close
to
his
breast
he
spoke
calmly
old
man
if
you
but
lay
a
finger
on
this
girl
i
will
kill
you
where
you
stand
no
power
on
earth
can
save
you
there
was
a
tone
in
john
voice
that
forced
even
sir
george
to
pause
then
sir
george
turned
to
me
this
is
the
man
who
was
in
my
house
he
is
the
man
who
called
himself
thomas
do
you
know
him
dorothy
saved
me
from
the
humiliation
of
an
answer
she
took
one
step
from
john
side
and
held
him
by
the
hand
while
she
spoke
father
she
said
this
man
is
sir
john
manners
now
you
may
understand
why
he
could
not
seek
my
hand
openly
and
you
also
know
why
i
could
not
tell
you
his
name
she
again
turned
to
john
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
you
can
imagine
much
better
that
i
can
describe
sir
george
fury
he
snatched
a
halberd
from
the
hands
of
a
yeoman
who
was
standing
near
by
and
started
toward
john
and
dorothy
thereupon
the
hard
old
warrior
sir
william
loe
whose
heart
one
would
surely
say
was
the
last
place
where
sentiment
could
dwell
performed
a
little
act
of
virtue
which
will
balance
many
a
page
on
the
debtor
side
of
his
ledger
of
life
he
lifted
his
sword
and
scabbard
and
struck
sir
george
outstretched
hand
causing
the
halberd
to
fall
to
the
ground
do
touch
the
girl
cried
sir
william
hoarsely
she
is
my
daughter
retorted
sir
george
who
was
stunned
mentally
as
well
as
physically
by
sir
william
blow
i
care
not
whose
daughter
she
is
returned
sir
william
you
shall
not
touch
her
if
you
make
but
one
other
attempt
i
will
use
my
blade
upon
you
sir
william
and
john
had
been
warm
friends
at
london
court
and
the
old
captain
of
the
guards
quickly
guessed
the
true
situation
when
he
saw
dorothy
run
to
john
arms
sir
you
shall
answer
for
this
said
sir
george
angrily
to
sir
william
with
pleasure
returned
sir
william
i
will
give
you
satisfaction
whenever
you
wish
it
save
this
present
time
i
am
too
busy
now
blessed
old
sir
william
you
have
been
dead
these
many
winters
and
were
i
a
priest
i
would
say
a
mass
for
your
soul
gratis
every
day
in
the
year
did
the
girl
betray
us
asked
queen
mary
no
one
answered
her
question
then
she
turned
toward
sir
john
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
he
turned
his
face
toward
her
signifying
that
he
was
listening
who
is
this
girl
mary
demanded
my
sweetheart
my
affianced
wife
john
answered
she
says
she
betrayed
us
the
queen
responded
yes
said
john
did
you
trust
her
with
knowledge
of
our
presence
in
rutland
mary
demanded
angrily
i
did
he
answered
you
were
a
fool
said
mary
i
know
it
responded
john
you
certainly
bear
her
no
resentment
for
her
treason
said
mary
i
certainly
do
not
quietly
answered
john
her
suffering
is
greater
than
mine
can
you
not
see
that
it
is
it
is
your
privilege
said
mary
scornfully
to
intrust
your
own
secrets
to
whomsoever
you
may
choose
for
your
confidant
and
it
is
quite
saintlike
in
you
to
forgive
this
person
for
betraying
you
but
what
think
you
of
the
hard
case
in
which
her
treason
and
your
folly
have
placed
me
that
is
my
greatest
grief
save
for
dorothy
answered
john
softly
lived
there
ever
a
man
possessed
of
broader
charity
or
deeper
love
than
john
god
surely
made
him
of
gold
dust
not
of
common
clay
queen
mary
stepped
away
from
john
in
disgust
and
when
she
turned
she
saw
me
for
the
first
time
she
started
and
was
about
to
speak
but
i
placed
my
fingers
warningly
upon
my
lips
and
she
remained
silent
where
do
you
take
us
sir
william
asked
john
to
haddon
hall
there
you
will
await
the
commands
of
the
queen
how
came
you
here
john
asked
gently
of
dorothy
i
rode
dolcy
she
whispered
she
dropped
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
yonder
she
lies
i
came
up
the
lathkil
by
the
long
road
and
i
hoped
that
i
might
reach
you
in
time
to
give
warning
when
the
guard
left
haddon
i
realized
the
evil
that
would
come
upon
you
by
reason
of
my
base
betrayal
here
she
broke
down
and
for
a
moment
could
not
proceed
in
the
narrative
she
soon
recovered
and
continued
then
i
mounted
dolcy
and
tried
to
reach
here
by
way
of
the
long
road
poor
dolcy
seemed
to
understand
my
trouble
and
my
despair
and
she
brought
me
with
all
the
speed
that
a
horse
could
make
but
the
road
was
too
long
and
too
rough
and
she
failed
and
i
failed
would
that
i
could
have
died
in
her
place
she
gave
her
life
in
trying
to
remedy
my
fault
dorothy
again
began
to
weep
and
john
tenderly
whispered
all
will
yet
come
right
then
he
kissed
her
before
us
all
and
handed
her
to
me
saying
care
for
her
i
pray
you
sir
john
spoke
a
few
words
to
sir
william
and
in
a
moment
they
both
went
back
to
the
castle
in
a
short
time
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
rutland
coach
drawn
by
four
horses
emerged
from
the
castle
grounds
sir
william
then
directed
mary
and
dorothy
to
enter
the
coach
and
requested
me
to
ride
with
them
to
haddon
hall
the
yeoman
guards
were
in
marching
order
and
i
took
my
seat
in
the
coach
the
fates
surely
were
in
a
humorous
mood
when
they
threw
dorothy
queen
mary
and
myself
together
pause
for
a
moment
and
consider
the
situation
you
know
all
the
facts
and
you
can
analyze
it
as
well
as
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
fantastic
trick
of
destiny
soon
after
i
entered
the
coach
sir
william
gave
the
word
and
the
yeomen
with
lord
rutland
and
john
moved
forward
on
the
road
to
haddon
the
coach
at
once
followed
the
guard
and
a
score
of
yeomen
followed
us
queen
mary
occupied
the
back
seat
of
the
coach
and
dorothy
and
i
sat
upon
the
front
seat
facing
her
dorothy
was
exhausted
and
her
head
lay
upon
my
shoulder
now
and
again
she
would
softly
moan
and
sob
but
she
said
nothing
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
queen
mary
spoke
why
did
you
betray
me
you
miserable
wretch
why
did
you
betray
me
dorothy
did
not
answer
mary
continued
have
i
ever
injured
you
in
any
manner
have
i
ever
harmed
you
by
thought
word
or
deed
dorothy
only
answer
was
a
sob
perhaps
you
are
a
canting
fanatic
and
it
may
be
that
you
hate
me
for
the
sake
of
that
which
you
call
the
love
of
god
no
no
madam
i
said
that
was
not
the
reason
do
you
know
the
reason
malcolm
asked
mary
addressing
me
for
the
first
time
my
name
upon
her
lips
had
a
strange
effect
on
me
it
was
like
the
wafting
to
my
nostrils
of
a
sweet
forgotten
odor
or
the
falling
upon
my
ears
of
a
tender
refrain
of
bygone
days
her
voice
in
uttering
my
name
thrilled
me
and
i
hated
myself
for
my
weakness
i
told
mary
that
i
did
not
know
dorothy
reasons
and
she
continued
malcolm
you
were
not
a
party
to
my
betrayal
for
the
sake
of
revenging
yourself
on
me
god
forbid
i
answered
sir
john
manners
will
assure
you
of
my
innocence
i
rode
with
mistress
vernon
to
a
within
a
league
of
rutland
hoping
thereby
to
assist
her
to
give
you
and
sir
john
the
alarm
my
admission
soon
brought
me
into
trouble
i
alone
am
to
blame
said
dorothy
faintly
i
can
easily
believe
you
said
mary
sharply
did
you
expect
to
injure
me
no
answer
came
from
dorothy
if
you
expect
to
injure
me
mary
continued
you
will
be
disappointed
i
am
a
queen
and
my
cousin
elizabeth
would
not
dare
to
harm
me
even
though
she
might
wish
to
do
so
we
are
of
the
same
blood
and
she
will
not
wish
to
do
me
injury
your
doting
lover
will
probably
lose
his
head
for
bringing
me
to
england
without
his
queen
consent
he
is
her
subject
i
am
not
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
trouble
you
have
brought
upon
him
and
upon
yourself
upon
him
cried
dorothy
yes
upon
him
continued
mary
relishing
the
torture
she
was
inflicting
you
will
enjoy
seeing
him
beheaded
will
you
not
you
fool
you
huzzy
you
wretch
i
hope
his
death
will
haunt
you
till
the
end
of
your
days
poor
dorothy
leaning
against
me
said
faintly
it
will
it
will
you
you
devil
the
girl
was
almost
dead
from
exhaustion
and
anguish
but
she
would
have
been
dead
indeed
had
she
lacked
the
power
to
strike
back
i
believe
had
it
not
been
for
dorothy
physical
weakness
she
would
have
silenced
mary
with
her
hands
after
a
little
time
dorothy
heavy
breathing
indicated
that
she
had
fallen
asleep
her
head
rested
upon
my
shoulder
and
the
delicious
perfume
of
her
hair
and
the
sweet
warm
breath
from
her
lips
were
almost
intoxicating
even
to
me
though
i
was
not
in
love
with
her
how
great
must
their
effect
have
been
coming
upon
john
hot
from
her
intense
young
soul
as
the
passed
the
coach
some
and
some
with
their
flambeaux
i
could
see
dorothy
sweet
pale
face
almost
hidden
in
the
tangled
golden
red
hair
which
fell
in
floods
about
her
the
perfect
oval
of
her
cheek
the
long
wet
lashes
the
arched
eyebrows
the
low
broad
forehead
the
straight
nose
the
saucy
chin
all
presented
a
picture
of
beauty
and
pathos
sufficient
to
soften
a
heart
of
stone
mary
had
no
heart
of
any
sort
therefore
she
was
not
moved
to
pity
that
emotion
i
am
sure
she
never
felt
from
the
first
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
she
continued
to
probe
dorothy
wound
until
i
told
her
the
girl
was
asleep
i
changed
dorothy
position
and
placed
her
head
against
the
corner
cushion
of
the
coach
that
she
might
rest
more
comfortably
she
did
not
awaken
when
i
moved
her
she
slept
and
looked
like
a
child
for
a
little
time
after
i
had
changed
dorothy
position
mary
and
i
sat
in
silence
she
was
the
first
to
speak
she
leaned
forward
and
placing
her
hands
upon
mine
whispered
my
name
malcolm
after
a
brief
silence
i
said
what
would
you
your
majesty
not
majesty
said
mary
softly
but
mary
as
of
old
she
remained
for
a
moment
with
her
hand
upon
my
knee
and
then
whispered
will
you
not
sit
by
me
malcolm
i
believe
that
mary
stuart
voice
was
the
charm
wherewith
she
fascinated
men
i
resisted
to
my
utmost
strength
but
that
seemed
to
be
little
more
than
utter
weakness
so
i
took
a
seat
by
her
side
and
she
gently
placed
her
hand
in
mine
the
warm
touch
of
her
strong
delicate
fingers
gave
me
a
familiar
thrill
she
asked
me
to
tell
her
of
my
wanderings
since
i
had
left
scotland
and
i
briefly
related
all
my
adventures
i
told
her
of
my
home
at
haddon
hall
and
of
the
welcome
given
me
by
my
cousin
sir
george
malcolm
have
you
forgotten
she
whispered
leaning
gently
against
me
have
you
forgotten
our
vows
and
love
have
you
forgotten
all
that
passed
between
us
in
the
dear
old
château
when
i
gave
to
you
my
virgin
love
fresh
from
my
virgin
heart
i
sighed
and
tried
to
harden
my
heart
to
her
blandishments
for
i
knew
she
wished
to
use
me
and
was
tempting
me
to
that
end
she
continued
i
was
then
only
fourteen
years
old
ten
years
ago
you
said
that
you
loved
me
and
i
believed
you
you
could
not
doubt
after
the
proof
i
gave
to
you
that
my
heart
was
all
yours
we
were
happy
oh
so
happy
do
you
remember
malcolm
she
brought
her
face
close
to
mine
while
she
spoke
and
pressed
my
hand
upon
her
breast
my
reason
told
me
that
it
was
but
the
song
of
the
siren
she
was
singing
to
my
ears
my
memory
told
me
that
she
had
been
false
to
me
twice
two
score
times
and
i
knew
full
well
she
would
again
be
false
to
me
or
to
any
other
man
whom
she
could
use
for
her
purposes
and
that
she
cared
not
the
price
at
which
she
purchased
him
bear
in
mind
you
who
would
blame
me
for
my
fall
that
this
woman
not
only
was
transcendently
beautiful
and
fatally
fascinating
but
she
was
a
queen
and
had
held
undisputed
sway
over
my
heart
for
more
years
than
i
could
accurately
number
as
i
said
added
to
all
her
beauty
she
was
a
queen
if
you
have
never
known
royalty
you
can
not
understand
its
enthralling
power
i
remember
it
all
madam
i
replied
trying
to
hold
myself
away
from
her
it
is
fresh
to
me
as
if
it
all
had
happened
yesterday
the
queen
drew
my
arm
closely
to
her
side
and
nestled
her
cheek
for
an
instant
upon
my
shoulder
i
remember
also
i
continued
your
marriage
with
darnley
when
i
had
your
promise
that
you
would
marry
me
and
shame
upon
shame
i
remember
your
marriage
with
darnley
murderer
bothwell
cruel
cruel
malcolm
she
said
you
well
know
the
overpowering
reasons
of
state
which
impelled
me
to
sacrifice
my
own
happiness
by
marrying
darnley
i
told
you
at
the
time
that
i
hated
the
marriage
more
than
i
dreaded
death
but
i
longed
to
quiet
the
factions
in
scotland
and
i
hoped
to
save
my
poor
bleeding
people
from
the
evils
of
war
you
know
i
hated
darnley
you
know
i
loved
you
you
knew
then
and
you
know
now
that
you
are
the
only
man
who
has
ever
possessed
my
heart
you
know
that
my
words
are
true
you
know
that
you
alone
have
had
my
love
since
the
time
when
i
was
a
child
and
rizzio
i
asked
ah
malcolm
she
answered
tearfully
i
hope
you
of
all
men
do
not
believe
that
i
ever
gave
a
thought
of
love
to
rizzio
he
was
to
me
like
my
pet
monkey
or
my
favorite
falcon
he
was
a
beautiful
gentle
harmless
soul
i
loved
him
for
his
music
he
worshipped
me
as
did
my
spaniel
still
i
was
determined
that
her
blandishments
should
not
move
me
and
bothwell
i
asked
that
is
past
endurance
from
you
malcolm
she
said
beginning
to
weep
you
know
i
was
brutally
abducted
and
was
forced
into
marriage
with
him
he
was
an
outlaw
an
outcast
he
was
an
uncouth
brute
whom
any
woman
would
loathe
i
was
in
his
power
and
i
feigned
acquiescence
only
that
i
might
escape
and
achieve
vengeance
upon
him
tell
me
malcolm
tell
me
continued
mary
placing
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
clinging
to
me
tell
me
you
to
whom
i
gave
my
maiden
love
you
who
have
my
woman
heart
tell
me
do
you
believe
that
i
could
willingly
have
married
bothwell
even
though
my
heart
had
not
been
filled
with
the
image
of
you
who
are
strong
gentle
and
beautiful
you
if
you
are
a
man
may
think
that
in
my
place
you
would
have
resisted
the
attack
of
this
beautiful
queen
but
if
so
you
think
pardon
me
my
friend
you
are
a
fool
under
the
spell
of
her
magic
influence
i
wavered
in
the
conviction
which
had
long
since
come
upon
me
that
i
had
for
years
been
her
fool
and
her
dupe
i
forgot
the
former
lessons
i
had
learned
from
her
perfidy
i
forgot
my
manhood
i
forgot
all
of
good
that
had
of
late
grown
up
in
me
god
help
me
i
forgot
even
madge
if
i
could
only
believe
you
mary
i
answered
growing
insane
under
the
influence
of
her
fascinations
if
i
could
only
believe
you
give
me
your
lips
malcolm
she
whispered
give
me
your
again
my
ah
now
you
believe
me
the
lying
logic
of
a
wanton
kiss
is
irresistible
i
was
drunk
and
alas
i
was
convinced
when
i
think
of
that
time
samson
is
my
only
comfort
samson
and
a
few
hundred
million
other
fools
who
like
samson
and
me
have
been
wheedled
kissed
and
duped
into
misery
and
ruin
i
said
i
do
believe
you
mary
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
for
having
doubted
you
you
have
been
traduced
and
brutally
misused
it
is
sweet
to
hear
you
speak
those
words
but
it
is
better
to
think
that
at
last
we
have
come
together
with
nothing
to
part
us
save
that
i
am
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
my
vindictive
jealous
cousin
i
thank
god
that
my
kingdom
of
scotland
has
been
taken
from
me
i
ever
hated
the
scots
they
are
an
ignorant
unkempt
stubborn
filthy
race
but
above
all
my
crown
stood
between
you
and
me
i
may
now
be
a
woman
and
were
it
not
for
elizabeth
you
and
i
could
yet
find
solace
in
each
other
for
all
our
past
sufferings
malcolm
i
have
a
sweet
thought
if
i
could
escape
to
fair
beautiful
france
all
would
be
happiness
for
us
you
could
claim
your
mother
estates
in
the
balmy
south
and
we
might
live
upon
them
help
me
my
malcolm
to
escape
and
your
reward
shall
be
greater
and
sweeter
than
man
ever
before
received
from
woman
i
struggled
against
her
blandishments
for
a
moment
but
i
was
lost
you
shall
escape
and
i
will
go
with
you
said
i
man
needs
to
make
but
one
little
prayer
to
god
lead
me
not
into
temptation
that
prayer
answered
all
else
of
good
will
follow
the
morning
sun
had
just
begun
to
rise
over
bowling
green
hill
and
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
fleeing
before
his
lances
when
our
cavalcade
entered
the
grounds
of
haddon
at
the
if
there
were
two
suns
revolving
about
the
earth
one
to
shine
upon
us
by
night
and
one
by
day
much
evil
would
be
averted
men
do
evil
in
the
dark
because
others
can
not
see
them
they
think
evil
in
the
dark
because
they
can
not
see
themselves
with
the
first
faint
gray
of
dawn
there
came
to
me
thoughts
of
madge
i
had
forgotten
her
but
her
familiar
spirit
the
light
brought
me
back
to
its
fair
mistress
when
our
coach
reached
the
stone
bridge
i
looked
up
to
the
hall
and
saw
madge
standing
at
the
open
casement
of
the
tower
window
she
had
been
watching
there
all
night
i
learned
hoping
for
our
speedy
and
safe
return
and
had
been
warned
of
our
approach
by
the
noise
of
the
tramping
guard
i
drew
back
from
the
coach
window
feeling
that
i
was
an
evil
shade
slinking
away
before
the
spirit
of
light
chapter
xv
light
dorothy
had
awakened
while
we
were
entering
rowsley
and
i
was
glad
that
mary
could
not
touch
me
again
when
our
coach
reached
the
stone
steps
of
the
entrance
tower
we
found
sir
george
lady
crawford
and
madge
waiting
to
receive
us
the
steps
and
the
path
leading
to
them
had
been
carpeted
with
soft
rugs
and
mary
although
a
prisoner
was
received
with
ceremonies
befitting
her
rank
it
was
a
proud
day
for
sir
george
when
the
roof
of
his
beautiful
hall
sheltered
the
two
most
famous
queens
of
christendom
sir
george
assisted
mary
from
the
coach
most
graciously
and
in
knightly
fashion
led
her
to
lady
crawford
and
madge
who
were
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
steps
due
presentations
were
made
and
the
ladies
of
haddon
having
kissed
the
queen
hand
mary
went
into
the
hall
upon
the
arm
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
peak
who
stepped
forward
most
proudly
his
resentment
against
dorothy
was
for
the
moment
neutralized
by
the
great
honor
of
which
his
house
and
himself
were
the
recipients
john
and
lord
rutland
were
taken
to
the
dungeon
i
assisted
dorothy
from
the
coach
and
led
her
to
madge
who
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
lowest
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
entrance
tower
doorway
dorothy
took
madge
outstretched
hand
but
madge
by
some
strange
instinct
knowing
of
my
presence
turned
her
face
toward
me
i
could
not
lift
my
eyes
to
her
face
nor
could
i
endure
to
remain
in
her
presence
while
we
were
ascending
the
steps
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
and
said
is
all
well
with
you
malcolm
her
voice
was
full
of
tender
concern
and
it
pained
me
to
the
heart
to
hear
her
speak
kindly
to
me
who
was
so
unworthy
of
her
smallest
thought
yes
lady
yes
madge
i
responded
but
she
knew
from
the
tones
of
my
voice
that
all
was
not
right
with
me
i
fear
malcolm
that
you
do
not
tell
me
the
truth
you
will
come
to
me
soon
she
asked
i
may
not
be
able
to
go
to
you
soon
i
answered
but
i
will
do
so
at
the
first
opportunity
the
torture
of
her
kindness
was
almost
unbearable
to
me
one
touch
of
her
hand
one
tone
of
her
rare
voice
had
made
me
loathe
myself
the
powers
of
evil
can
not
stand
for
one
moment
in
a
fair
conflict
with
the
powers
of
good
i
felt
that
i
alone
was
to
blame
for
my
treason
to
madge
but
despite
my
effort
at
there
was
an
that
mary
stuart
was
to
blame
and
i
hated
her
accordingly
although
madge
presence
hurt
me
it
was
not
because
i
wished
to
conceal
my
conduct
from
her
i
knew
that
i
could
be
happy
again
only
after
i
had
confessed
to
her
and
had
received
forgiveness
madge
who
was
blind
of
sight
led
dorothy
who
was
piteously
blind
of
soul
and
the
two
girls
went
to
their
apartments
curiosity
is
not
foreign
even
to
the
royal
female
breast
and
while
mary
stuart
was
entering
haddon
hall
i
saw
the
luminous
head
of
the
virgin
queen
peeked
out
at
a
casement
on
the
second
floor
watching
her
rival
with
all
the
curiosity
of
a
dutch
woman
sitting
by
her
window
mirror
i
went
to
my
room
in
eagle
tower
fell
upon
my
bed
and
abandoned
myself
to
an
anguish
of
soul
which
was
almost
luxurious
i
shall
not
tease
you
with
the
details
of
my
mental
and
moral
processes
i
hung
in
the
balance
a
long
time
undetermined
what
course
i
should
pursue
the
difference
between
the
influence
of
mary
and
the
effect
wrought
by
madge
was
the
difference
between
the
intoxication
and
the
exhilaration
of
wine
following
the
intoxication
of
mary
presence
ever
came
a
torturing
reaction
while
the
exhilarating
influence
of
madge
gave
health
and
strength
i
chose
the
latter
i
have
always
been
glad
i
reached
that
determination
without
the
aid
of
any
impulse
outside
of
myself
for
events
soon
happened
which
again
drove
all
faith
in
mary
from
my
heart
forever
those
events
would
have
forced
me
to
abandon
my
trust
in
her
but
mind
you
i
took
my
good
resolve
from
inclination
rather
than
necessity
before
i
learned
of
mary
perfidy
the
events
of
the
night
had
exhausted
dorothy
and
she
was
confined
to
her
bed
by
illness
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
believed
that
she
was
dying
and
she
did
not
want
to
live
i
did
not
go
to
her
apartments
madge
remained
with
her
and
i
feared
to
face
the
girl
to
whom
i
had
been
untrue
dorothy
one
and
only
desire
of
course
was
to
see
john
but
that
desire
for
a
time
seemed
impossible
of
accomplishment
elizabeth
cecil
leicester
and
sir
william
loe
were
in
secret
consultation
many
times
during
three
or
four
days
and
nights
occasionally
sir
george
was
called
into
their
councils
and
that
flattering
attention
so
wrought
upon
the
old
man
pride
that
he
was
a
slave
to
the
slightest
wish
and
was
more
tyrannical
and
dictatorial
than
ever
before
to
all
the
rest
of
mankind
there
were
however
two
persons
besides
the
queen
before
whom
sir
george
was
gracious
one
of
these
was
mary
stuart
whose
powers
of
fascination
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
king
of
the
peak
most
effectively
the
other
was
leicester
to
whom
as
my
cousin
expressed
it
he
hoped
to
dispose
of
that
troublesome
and
disturbing
body
dorothy
these
influences
together
with
the
fact
that
his
enemies
of
rutland
were
in
the
haddon
dungeon
had
given
sir
george
a
and
dorothy
even
in
the
face
of
her
father
discovery
that
manners
was
her
mysterious
lover
had
for
once
a
respite
from
sir
george
just
and
mighty
wrath
the
purpose
of
elizabeth
many
councils
of
war
was
to
devise
some
means
of
obtaining
from
john
and
his
father
information
concerning
the
plot
which
had
resulted
in
bringing
mary
stuart
into
england
the
ultimate
purpose
of
mary
visit
elizabeth
counsellors
firmly
believed
to
be
the
dethronement
of
the
english
queen
and
the
enthronement
of
her
scottish
cousin
elizabeth
in
her
heart
felt
confident
that
john
and
his
father
were
not
parties
to
the
treasonable
plot
although
she
had
been
warned
against
each
of
them
cecil
and
sir
william
loe
also
secretly
held
to
that
opinion
though
neither
of
them
expressed
it
elizabeth
was
conscious
of
having
given
to
john
while
at
london
court
an
intimation
that
she
would
be
willing
that
mary
should
visit
england
of
such
intimation
cecil
and
sir
william
had
no
knowledge
though
they
together
with
many
persons
of
the
court
believed
that
elizabeth
was
not
entirely
averse
to
presence
lord
rutland
and
john
were
questioned
by
cecil
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
hints
which
might
lead
to
the
detection
of
those
concerned
in
the
chief
plot
provided
such
plot
existed
but
lord
rutland
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
except
that
john
had
brought
the
scottish
queen
from
scotland
and
john
persisted
in
the
statement
that
he
had
no
confederate
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
any
plot
to
place
mary
upon
the
english
throne
john
said
i
received
from
queen
mary
friends
in
scotland
letters
asking
me
to
meet
her
on
the
border
and
requesting
me
to
conduct
her
to
my
father
castle
those
letters
mentioned
no
englishman
but
myself
and
they
stated
that
queen
mary
flight
to
england
was
to
be
undertaken
with
the
tacit
consent
of
our
gracious
queen
that
fact
the
letters
told
me
our
queen
wished
should
not
be
known
there
were
reasons
of
state
the
letters
said
which
made
it
impolitic
for
our
queen
openly
to
invite
queen
mary
to
seek
sanctuary
in
england
i
received
those
letters
before
i
left
westminster
upon
the
day
when
i
received
them
i
heard
our
gracious
queen
say
that
she
would
gladly
invite
queen
mary
to
england
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
such
an
invitation
would
cause
trouble
between
her
and
the
regent
murray
her
majesty
at
the
same
time
intimated
that
she
would
be
glad
if
mary
stuart
should
come
to
england
uninvited
john
turned
to
elizabeth
i
beg
your
majesty
in
justice
to
ratify
my
words
elizabeth
hesitated
for
a
moment
after
john
appeal
but
her
love
of
justice
came
to
her
rescue
and
she
hung
her
head
as
she
said
you
are
right
sir
john
then
she
looked
her
counsellors
in
the
face
and
said
i
well
remember
that
i
so
expressed
myself
in
truth
said
john
i
having
only
an
hour
before
received
the
letter
from
scotland
believed
that
your
majesty
words
were
meant
for
my
ear
i
felt
that
your
majesty
knew
of
the
letters
and
i
thought
that
i
should
be
carrying
out
your
royal
wishes
should
i
bring
queen
mary
into
england
without
your
knowledge
the
queen
responded
i
then
felt
that
i
wished
queen
mary
to
seek
refuge
in
my
kingdom
but
so
many
untoward
events
have
transpired
since
i
spoke
on
the
subject
at
westminster
that
i
have
good
cause
to
change
my
mind
though
i
easily
understand
how
you
might
have
been
misled
by
my
words
i
am
sure
replied
john
that
your
majesty
has
had
good
cause
to
change
your
mind
but
i
protest
in
all
sincerity
that
i
considered
the
scottish
letters
to
be
a
command
from
my
queen
elizabeth
was
a
strange
combination
of
paradoxes
no
one
could
be
truer
than
she
to
a
fixed
determination
once
taken
no
one
could
be
swayed
by
doubt
so
easily
as
she
to
change
her
mind
sixty
times
in
the
space
of
a
minute
during
one
moment
she
was
minded
to
liberate
john
and
lord
rutland
in
the
next
she
determined
to
hold
them
in
prison
hoping
to
learn
from
them
some
substantial
fact
concerning
the
plot
which
since
mary
arrival
in
england
had
become
a
nightmare
to
her
but
with
all
her
vagaries
the
virgin
queen
surely
loved
justice
that
quality
alone
makes
a
sovereign
great
elizabeth
like
her
mother
anne
boleyn
had
great
faith
in
her
personal
beauty
like
her
father
she
had
unbounded
confidence
in
her
powers
of
mind
she
took
great
pride
in
the
ease
with
which
she
controlled
persons
she
believed
that
no
one
was
so
adroit
as
elizabeth
tudor
in
extracting
secrets
from
others
and
in
unravelling
mysterious
situations
nor
so
cunning
in
hunting
out
plots
and
in
running
down
plotters
in
all
such
matters
she
delighted
to
act
secretly
and
alone
during
the
numerous
councils
held
at
haddon
elizabeth
allowed
cecil
to
question
john
to
his
heart
content
but
while
she
listened
she
formulated
a
plan
of
her
own
which
she
was
sure
would
be
effective
in
extracting
all
the
truth
from
john
if
all
the
truth
had
not
already
been
extracted
elizabeth
kept
her
cherished
plan
to
herself
it
was
this
she
would
visit
dorothy
whom
she
knew
to
be
ill
and
would
by
her
subtle
art
steal
from
john
sweetheart
all
that
the
girl
knew
of
the
case
if
john
had
told
dorothy
part
of
the
affair
concerning
mary
stuart
he
had
probably
told
her
all
and
elizabeth
felt
confident
that
she
could
easily
pump
the
girl
dry
she
did
not
know
dorothy
accordingly
our
queen
elizabeth
the
adroit
went
to
dorothy
room
under
the
pretence
of
paying
the
girl
a
gracious
visit
dorothy
wished
to
arise
and
receive
her
royal
guest
but
elizabeth
said
gently
do
not
arise
dorothy
rest
quietly
and
i
will
sit
here
beside
you
on
the
bed
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
must
recover
your
health
at
once
we
miss
you
greatly
in
the
hall
no
one
could
be
more
gracious
than
elizabeth
when
the
humor
was
upon
her
though
in
truth
the
humor
was
often
lacking
let
us
send
all
save
you
and
me
from
the
room
said
the
queen
that
we
may
have
a
quiet
little
chat
together
all
who
were
in
the
room
save
dorothy
and
elizabeth
of
course
departed
at
once
when
the
door
was
closed
the
queen
said
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
telling
me
of
the
presence
of
her
scottish
majesty
at
rutland
you
know
there
is
a
plot
on
foot
to
steal
my
throne
from
me
god
forbid
that
there
should
be
such
a
plot
replied
dorothy
resting
upon
her
elbow
in
the
bed
i
fear
it
is
only
too
true
that
there
is
such
a
plot
returned
elizabeth
and
i
owe
you
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
for
warning
me
of
the
scottish
queen
presence
in
my
kingdom
i
hope
the
danger
will
be
averted
from
your
majesty
said
dorothy
but
that
which
i
did
will
cause
my
death
it
will
kill
me
no
human
being
ever
before
has
lived
through
the
agony
i
have
suffered
since
that
terrible
night
i
was
a
traitress
i
betrayed
the
man
who
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
immortal
soul
he
says
that
he
forgives
me
but
your
majesty
knows
that
my
fault
is
beyond
forgiveness
sir
john
is
a
noble
gentleman
child
said
the
queen
i
hope
that
he
is
loyal
to
me
but
i
fear
i
fear
do
not
doubt
do
not
fear
my
queen
returned
dorothy
eagerly
there
is
nothing
false
in
him
do
you
love
him
deeply
little
one
asked
the
queen
no
words
can
tell
you
my
love
for
him
answered
the
girl
i
feel
shame
to
say
that
he
has
taken
even
the
holy
god
place
in
my
heart
perhaps
it
is
for
that
sin
that
god
now
punishes
me
fear
not
on
that
score
dorothy
replied
the
queen
god
will
not
punish
you
for
feeling
the
love
which
he
himself
has
put
into
your
heart
i
would
willingly
give
my
crown
could
i
feel
such
love
for
a
worthy
man
who
would
in
return
love
me
for
myself
but
i
can
not
feel
nor
can
i
have
faith
which
is
so
dominant
in
all
men
frightens
me
and
i
doubt
their
vows
surely
any
man
would
love
you
for
your
own
sake
said
dorothy
tenderly
it
may
be
that
you
speak
truly
child
but
i
can
not
know
when
men
vows
are
true
nor
when
they
are
false
the
real
trouble
is
within
myself
if
i
could
but
feel
truly
i
could
interpret
truthfully
ah
your
majesty
interrupted
dorothy
you
do
not
know
the
thing
for
which
you
are
wishing
it
is
a
torture
worse
than
death
it
is
an
ecstasy
sweeter
than
heaven
it
is
killing
me
i
pity
you
though
you
are
a
queen
if
you
have
never
felt
it
would
you
do
anything
i
might
ask
of
you
if
you
could
thereby
save
sir
john
life
asked
the
queen
ah
i
would
gladly
give
my
soul
to
save
him
responded
dorothy
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
eagerness
in
her
voice
oh
my
queen
do
not
lead
me
to
hope
and
then
plunge
me
again
into
despair
give
me
no
encouragement
unless
you
mean
to
free
him
as
for
my
part
take
my
life
and
spare
john
kill
me
by
torture
burn
me
at
the
stake
stretch
me
upon
the
rack
till
my
joints
are
severed
and
my
flesh
is
torn
asunder
let
me
die
by
inches
my
queen
but
spare
him
oh
spare
him
and
do
with
me
as
you
will
ask
from
me
what
you
wish
gladly
will
i
do
all
that
you
may
demand
gladly
will
i
welcome
death
and
call
it
sweet
if
i
can
thereby
save
him
the
faint
hope
your
majesty
words
hold
out
makes
me
strong
again
come
come
take
my
life
take
all
that
i
can
give
give
me
him
do
you
believe
that
i
am
an
ogress
thirsting
for
blood
dorothy
that
you
offer
me
your
life
for
his
you
can
purchase
sir
john
life
at
a
much
smaller
cost
dorothy
rose
to
the
queen
with
a
cry
and
put
her
arms
about
her
neck
you
may
purchase
his
freedom
continued
the
queen
and
you
may
serve
your
loving
queen
at
one
and
the
same
time
if
you
wish
to
do
so
dorothy
had
sunk
back
into
the
bed
and
elizabeth
was
sitting
close
by
her
side
but
when
the
queen
spoke
she
turned
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
kissed
the
royal
hand
which
was
resting
upon
the
coverlid
ah
you
are
so
good
so
true
and
so
beautiful
said
dorothy
her
familiarity
toward
the
queen
was
sweet
to
the
woman
to
whom
it
was
new
dorothy
did
not
thank
the
queen
for
her
graciousness
she
did
not
reply
directly
to
her
offer
she
simply
said
john
has
told
me
many
times
that
he
was
first
attracted
to
me
because
i
resembled
you
the
girl
had
ample
faith
in
her
own
beauty
and
knew
full
well
the
subtle
flattery
which
lay
in
her
words
he
said
she
continued
that
my
hair
in
some
faint
degree
resembled
yours
but
he
said
it
was
not
of
so
beautiful
a
hue
i
have
loved
my
hair
ever
since
the
day
he
told
me
that
it
resembled
your
majesty
the
girl
leaned
forward
toward
the
queen
and
gently
kissed
the
royal
locks
they
no
more
resembled
dorothy
hair
than
brick
dust
resembles
the
sheen
of
gold
the
queen
glanced
at
the
reflection
of
her
hair
in
the
mirror
and
it
flatly
contradicted
dorothy
but
the
girl
words
were
backed
by
elizabeth
vanity
and
the
adroit
flattery
went
home
ah
my
child
exclaimed
her
majesty
softly
as
she
leaned
forward
and
kissed
dorothy
fair
cheek
dorothy
wept
gently
for
a
moment
and
familiarly
rested
her
face
upon
the
queen
breast
then
she
entwined
her
white
arms
about
elizabeth
neck
and
turned
her
glorious
eyes
up
to
the
queen
face
that
her
majesty
might
behold
their
wondrous
beauty
and
feel
the
flattery
of
the
words
she
was
about
to
utter
he
said
also
continued
dorothy
that
my
eyes
in
some
slight
degree
resembled
your
majesty
but
he
qualified
his
compliment
by
telling
me
he
did
not
exactly
tell
me
that
my
eyes
were
not
so
large
and
brilliant
as
your
majesty
for
he
was
making
love
to
me
and
of
course
he
would
not
have
dared
to
say
that
my
eyes
were
not
the
most
perfect
on
earth
but
he
did
say
that
at
least
i
know
that
he
meant
that
my
eyes
while
they
resembled
yours
were
hardly
so
glorious
and
and
i
am
very
jealous
of
your
majesty
john
will
be
leaving
me
to
worship
at
your
feet
elizabeth
eyes
were
good
enough
the
french
called
them
marcassin
that
is
wild
boar
eyes
they
were
little
and
sparkling
they
were
not
luminous
and
large
like
dorothy
and
the
girl
flattery
was
rank
elizabeth
however
saw
dorothy
eyes
and
believed
her
words
rather
than
the
reply
of
the
lying
mirror
and
her
majesty
heart
was
soft
from
the
girl
kneading
consider
i
pray
you
the
wisdom
displayed
by
dorothy
method
of
attack
upon
the
queen
she
did
not
ask
for
liberty
she
did
not
seek
it
she
sought
only
to
place
john
softly
on
elizabeth
heart
some
natures
absorb
flattery
as
the
desert
sands
absorb
the
unfrequent
rain
and
elizabeth
but
i
will
speak
no
ill
of
her
she
is
the
greatest
and
the
best
sovereign
england
has
ever
had
may
god
send
to
my
beloved
country
others
like
her
she
had
many
small
shortcomings
but
i
have
noticed
that
those
persons
who
spend
their
evil
energies
in
little
faults
have
less
force
left
for
greater
ones
i
will
show
you
a
mystery
little
faults
are
personally
more
disagreeable
and
rasping
to
us
than
great
ones
like
flying
grains
of
sand
upon
a
windy
day
they
vex
us
constantly
great
faults
come
like
an
avalanche
but
they
come
less
frequently
and
we
often
admire
their
possessor
who
sooner
or
later
is
apt
to
become
our
destroyer
i
can
hardly
tell
you
said
dorothy
in
response
to
a
question
by
elizabeth
i
can
hardly
tell
you
why
i
informed
your
majesty
of
queen
mary
presence
at
rutland
i
did
it
partly
for
love
of
your
majesty
and
partly
because
i
was
jealous
of
that
white
plain
woman
from
scotland
she
is
not
a
plain
woman
is
she
said
elizabeth
delighted
to
hear
mary
of
scotland
so
spoken
of
for
once
one
way
to
flatter
some
women
is
to
berate
those
whom
they
despise
or
fear
elizabeth
loved
dorothy
better
for
the
hatred
which
the
girl
bore
to
mary
both
stood
upon
a
broad
plane
of
mutual
of
the
same
woman
it
united
the
queen
and
the
maiden
in
a
common
cause
dorothy
confidence
grew
apace
she
is
plain
replied
dorothy
poutingly
she
appears
plain
colorless
and
repulsive
by
the
side
of
your
majesty
no
no
dorothy
that
can
not
be
returned
queen
elizabeth
gently
patting
dorothy
cheek
and
glancing
stealthily
at
the
reflection
of
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
at
this
point
dorothy
considered
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
direct
attack
your
majesty
need
have
no
fear
of
a
plot
to
place
queen
mary
upon
your
throne
the
english
people
would
not
endure
her
wicked
pale
face
for
a
moment
but
there
is
such
a
plot
in
existence
said
elizabeth
what
you
say
may
be
true
returned
dorothy
but
your
majesty
john
is
not
in
the
plot
and
he
knows
nothing
of
it
i
hope
i
believe
he
is
not
in
the
plot
said
elizabeth
but
i
fear
the
girl
kissed
the
sleeve
of
elizabeth
gown
and
then
she
drew
the
queen
closer
to
her
and
kissed
her
hair
and
her
face
ah
my
beauteous
queen
said
dorothy
i
thank
you
for
those
words
you
must
know
that
john
loves
you
and
is
your
loyal
subject
take
pity
upon
me
help
me
hold
out
your
gracious
hand
and
lift
me
from
my
despair
dorothy
slipped
from
the
bed
and
fell
on
her
knees
burying
her
face
in
the
queen
lap
elizabeth
was
touched
by
the
girl
appeal
and
caressingly
stroked
her
hair
as
she
said
i
believe
he
is
innocent
but
i
fear
he
knows
or
suspects
others
who
harbor
treasonable
designs
tell
me
dorothy
do
you
know
of
any
such
persons
if
you
can
tell
me
their
names
you
will
serve
your
queen
and
will
save
your
lover
no
harm
shall
come
to
sir
john
and
no
one
save
myself
shall
have
knowledge
of
any
word
that
you
may
speak
if
i
do
not
learn
the
names
of
the
traitors
through
you
or
through
sir
john
i
may
be
compelled
to
hold
him
a
prisoner
until
i
discover
them
if
through
you
i
learn
them
sir
john
shall
go
free
at
once
gladly
for
your
majesty
sake
alone
would
i
tell
you
the
names
of
such
traitorous
men
did
i
know
them
replied
dorothy
and
thrice
gladly
would
i
do
so
if
i
might
thereby
liberate
john
your
majesty
must
see
that
these
motives
are
strong
enough
to
induce
me
to
speak
if
i
knew
aught
to
tell
you
i
would
betray
the
whole
world
to
save
him
of
that
you
may
be
sure
but
alas
i
know
no
man
whom
i
can
betray
john
told
me
nothing
of
his
expedition
to
the
scottish
border
save
what
was
in
two
letters
which
he
sent
to
me
one
of
these
i
received
before
he
left
rutland
and
the
other
after
his
return
she
fetched
the
letters
to
the
queen
who
read
them
carefully
perhaps
if
i
were
to
see
him
he
might
upon
my
importunity
tell
me
all
he
knows
concerning
the
affair
and
those
connected
with
it
if
he
knows
anything
more
than
he
has
already
told
said
dorothy
by
a
great
effort
suppressing
her
eagerness
i
am
sure
your
majesty
he
would
tell
me
all
should
he
tell
me
the
names
of
any
persons
connected
with
any
treasonable
plot
i
will
certainly
tell
you
it
would
be
base
in
me
again
to
betray
john
confidence
but
your
majesty
has
promised
me
his
life
and
liberty
and
to
obtain
those
i
would
do
anything
however
evil
it
might
be
if
i
may
see
john
i
promise
to
learn
all
that
he
knows
if
he
knows
anything
and
i
also
promise
to
tell
you
word
for
word
all
that
he
says
the
girl
felt
safe
in
making
these
promises
since
she
was
sure
that
john
knew
nothing
of
a
treasonable
character
the
queen
thinking
that
she
had
adroitly
led
dorothy
up
to
making
the
offer
said
i
accept
the
conditions
be
in
readiness
to
visit
sir
john
upon
my
command
thus
the
compact
was
sealed
and
the
queen
who
thought
herself
wise
was
used
by
the
girl
who
thought
herself
simple
for
the
purpose
of
hiding
her
exultation
dorothy
appeared
to
be
ill
but
when
the
queen
passed
out
at
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
her
the
girl
sprang
from
the
bed
and
danced
around
the
room
as
if
she
were
a
from
the
depths
of
despair
she
flew
to
the
pinnacle
of
hope
she
knew
however
that
she
must
conceal
her
happiness
therefore
she
went
back
to
bed
and
waited
impatiently
the
summons
of
elizabeth
requiring
her
to
go
to
john
but
now
i
must
pause
to
tell
you
of
my
troubles
which
followed
so
swiftly
upon
the
heels
of
my
fault
that
i
was
fairly
stunned
by
them
my
narrative
will
be
brief
and
i
shall
soon
bring
you
back
again
to
dorothy
queen
mary
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
haddon
hall
than
she
opened
an
attack
upon
leicester
somewhat
after
the
same
plan
i
suppose
which
she
had
followed
with
me
in
the
coach
she
could
no
more
easily
resist
inviting
homage
from
men
than
a
swallow
can
refrain
from
flying
thus
from
inclination
and
policy
she
sought
leicester
and
endeavored
by
the
pleasant
paths
of
her
blandishments
to
lead
him
to
her
cause
there
can
be
no
doubt
concerning
leicester
wishes
in
the
premises
had
mary
cause
held
elements
of
success
he
would
have
joined
her
but
he
feared
elizabeth
and
he
hoped
some
day
to
share
her
throne
he
would
however
prefer
to
share
the
throne
with
mary
mary
told
him
of
her
plans
and
hopes
she
told
him
that
i
had
ridden
with
dorothy
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
john
and
herself
and
that
i
had
promised
to
help
her
to
escape
to
france
she
told
him
she
would
use
me
for
her
tool
in
making
her
escape
and
would
discard
me
when
once
she
should
be
safe
out
of
england
then
would
come
leicester
turn
then
should
my
lord
have
his
recompense
and
together
they
would
regain
the
scottish
crown
how
deeply
leicester
became
engaged
in
the
plot
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
through
fear
of
elizabeth
or
for
the
purpose
of
winning
her
favor
he
unfolded
to
our
queen
all
the
details
of
mary
scheme
together
with
the
full
story
of
my
ride
with
dorothy
to
rutland
and
my
return
with
dorothy
and
mary
in
the
coach
thereupon
mary
was
placed
under
strict
guard
the
story
spread
quickly
through
the
hall
and
dawson
brought
it
to
me
on
hearing
it
my
first
thought
was
of
madge
i
knew
it
would
soon
reach
her
therefore
i
determined
to
go
to
her
at
once
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
all
my
perfidy
had
i
done
so
sooner
i
should
at
least
have
had
the
benefit
of
an
honest
voluntary
confession
but
my
conscience
had
made
a
coward
of
me
and
the
woman
who
had
been
my
curse
for
years
had
so
completely
disturbed
my
mind
that
i
should
have
been
quite
as
well
off
without
any
at
all
it
led
me
from
one
mistake
into
another
after
dawson
told
me
that
my
miserable
story
was
known
throughout
the
hall
i
sought
madge
and
found
her
with
aunt
dorothy
she
was
weeping
and
i
at
once
knew
that
i
was
too
late
with
my
confession
i
spoke
her
name
madge
and
stood
by
her
side
awaiting
her
reply
is
it
true
malcolm
she
asked
i
can
not
believe
it
till
i
hear
it
from
your
lips
it
was
true
i
responded
i
promised
to
help
queen
mary
escape
and
i
promised
to
go
with
her
but
within
one
hour
of
the
time
when
i
gave
my
word
i
regretted
it
as
i
have
never
regretted
anything
else
in
all
my
life
i
resolved
that
while
i
should
according
to
my
promise
help
the
scottish
queen
escape
i
would
not
go
with
her
i
resolved
to
wait
here
at
haddon
to
tell
all
to
you
and
to
our
queen
and
then
i
would
patiently
take
my
just
punishment
from
each
my
doom
from
the
queen
i
believed
would
probably
be
death
but
i
feared
more
your
god
help
me
it
is
useless
for
me
to
speak
here
i
broke
down
and
fell
upon
my
knees
crying
madge
madge
pity
me
pity
me
forgive
me
if
you
can
and
if
our
queen
decrees
it
i
shall
die
happy
in
my
desperation
i
caught
the
girl
hand
but
she
drew
it
quickly
from
me
and
said
do
not
touch
me
she
arose
to
her
feet
and
groped
her
way
to
her
bedroom
we
were
in
aunt
dorothy
room
i
watched
madge
as
she
sought
with
her
outstretched
hand
the
doorway
and
when
she
passed
slowly
through
it
the
sun
of
my
life
seemed
to
turn
black
just
as
madge
passed
from
the
room
sir
william
loe
with
two
yeomen
entered
by
sir
george
door
and
placed
irons
upon
my
wrist
and
ankles
i
was
led
by
sir
william
to
the
dungeon
and
no
word
was
spoken
by
either
of
us
i
had
never
in
my
life
feared
death
and
now
i
felt
that
i
would
welcome
it
when
a
man
is
convinced
that
his
life
is
useless
through
the
dire
disaster
that
he
is
a
fool
he
values
it
little
and
is
even
more
than
willing
to
lose
it
then
there
were
three
of
us
in
the
dungeon
john
lord
rutland
and
myself
and
we
were
all
there
because
we
had
meddled
in
the
affairs
of
others
and
because
dorothy
had
inherited
from
eve
a
capacity
for
insane
unreasoning
jealousy
lord
rutland
was
sitting
on
the
ground
in
a
corner
of
the
dungeon
john
by
the
help
of
a
projecting
stone
in
the
masonry
had
climbed
to
the
small
grated
opening
which
served
to
admit
a
few
straggling
rays
of
light
into
the
dungeon
gloom
he
was
gazing
out
upon
the
fair
day
whose
beauty
he
feared
would
soon
fade
away
from
him
forever
elizabeth
coldness
had
given
him
no
hope
it
had
taken
all
hope
from
his
father
the
opening
of
the
door
attracted
john
attention
and
he
turned
his
face
toward
me
when
i
entered
he
had
been
looking
toward
the
light
and
his
eyes
unaccustomed
for
the
moment
to
the
darkness
failed
at
first
to
recognize
of
me
when
the
dungeon
door
had
closed
behind
me
he
sprang
down
from
his
perch
by
the
window
and
came
toward
me
with
outstretched
hands
he
said
sorrowfully
malcolm
have
i
brought
you
here
too
why
are
you
in
irons
it
seems
that
i
am
destined
to
bring
calamity
upon
all
whom
i
love
it
is
a
long
story
i
replied
laughingly
i
will
tell
it
to
you
when
the
time
begins
to
drag
but
i
tell
you
now
it
is
through
no
fault
of
yours
that
i
am
here
no
one
is
to
blame
for
my
misfortune
but
myself
then
i
continued
bitterly
unless
it
be
the
good
god
who
created
me
a
fool
john
went
to
his
father
side
and
said
sir
malcolm
is
here
father
will
you
not
rise
and
greet
him
john
voice
aroused
his
father
and
the
old
lord
came
to
the
little
patch
of
light
in
which
i
was
standing
and
said
a
terrible
evil
has
fallen
upon
us
sir
malcolm
and
without
our
fault
i
grieve
to
learn
that
you
also
are
entangled
in
the
web
the
future
looks
very
dark
cheer
up
father
said
john
taking
the
old
man
hand
light
will
soon
come
i
am
sure
it
will
i
have
tried
all
my
life
to
be
a
just
man
said
lord
rutland
i
have
failed
at
times
i
fear
but
i
have
tried
that
is
all
any
man
can
do
i
pray
that
god
in
his
mercy
will
soon
send
light
to
you
john
whatever
of
darkness
there
may
be
in
store
for
me
i
thought
he
will
surely
answer
this
just
man
prayer
and
almost
before
the
thought
was
completed
the
dungeon
door
turned
upon
its
hinges
and
a
great
light
came
with
glorious
refulgence
through
the
open
portal
dorothy
john
never
before
did
one
word
express
so
much
of
mingled
joy
and
grief
fear
and
confidence
and
greater
than
all
love
unutterable
were
blended
in
its
eloquent
tones
she
sprang
to
john
as
the
lightning
leaps
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
he
caught
her
to
his
heart
he
gently
kissed
her
hair
her
face
being
hidden
in
the
folds
of
his
doublet
let
me
kneel
john
let
me
kneel
she
murmured
no
dorothy
no
he
responded
holding
her
closely
in
his
arms
but
one
moment
john
she
pleased
no
no
let
me
see
your
eyes
sweet
one
said
john
trying
to
turn
her
face
upward
toward
his
own
i
can
not
yet
john
i
can
not
please
let
me
kneel
for
one
little
moment
at
your
feet
john
saw
that
the
girl
would
find
relief
in
so
he
relaxed
his
arms
and
she
sank
to
her
knees
upon
the
dungeon
floor
she
wept
softly
for
a
moment
and
then
throwing
back
her
head
with
her
old
impulsive
manner
looked
up
into
his
face
oh
forgive
me
john
forgive
me
not
that
i
deserve
your
forgiveness
but
because
you
pity
me
i
forgave
you
long
ago
dorothy
you
had
my
full
forgiveness
before
you
asked
it
he
lifted
the
weeping
girl
to
her
feet
and
the
two
clung
together
in
silence
after
a
pause
dorothy
spoke
you
have
not
asked
me
john
why
i
betrayed
you
i
want
to
know
nothing
dorothy
save
that
you
love
me
that
you
already
know
but
you
can
not
know
how
much
i
love
you
i
myself
do
know
john
i
seem
to
have
turned
all
to
love
much
there
is
of
me
that
much
there
is
of
love
for
you
as
the
salt
is
in
every
drop
of
the
sea
so
love
is
in
every
part
of
my
being
but
john
she
continued
drooping
her
head
and
speaking
regretfully
the
salt
in
the
sea
is
not
unmixed
with
many
things
hurtful
her
face
blushed
with
shame
and
she
continued
limpingly
and
my
love
is
not
is
not
without
evil
oh
john
i
feel
deep
shame
in
telling
you
but
my
love
is
terribly
jealous
at
times
a
jealousy
comes
over
me
so
fierce
and
so
distracting
that
under
its
influence
i
am
mad
john
mad
i
then
see
nothing
in
its
true
light
my
eyes
seem
filled
with
with
blood
and
all
things
appear
red
or
black
and
and
oh
john
i
pray
you
never
again
cause
me
jealousy
it
makes
a
demon
of
me
you
may
well
know
that
john
was
nonplussed
i
cause
you
jealousy
he
asked
in
surprise
when
did
i
but
dorothy
interrupted
him
her
eyes
flashing
darkly
and
a
note
of
fierceness
in
her
voice
he
saw
for
himself
the
effects
of
jealousy
upon
her
that
white
white
scottish
wanton
god
curse
be
upon
her
she
tried
to
steal
you
from
me
perhaps
she
did
replied
john
smilingly
of
that
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
do
know
and
you
dorothy
must
know
it
too
henceforth
and
for
all
time
to
come
no
woman
can
steal
my
love
from
you
since
i
gave
you
my
troth
i
have
been
true
to
you
i
have
not
been
false
even
in
one
little
thought
i
feel
sure
john
that
you
have
not
been
untrue
to
me
said
the
girl
with
a
faint
smile
playing
about
her
lips
but
but
you
remember
the
strange
woman
at
bowling
green
gate
whom
you
would
have
dorothy
i
hope
you
have
not
come
to
my
dungeon
for
the
purpose
of
making
me
more
wretched
than
i
already
am
no
no
john
forgive
me
she
cried
softly
but
john
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
and
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
too
will
hate
her
i
promise
said
john
though
you
have
had
no
cause
for
jealousy
of
queen
mary
perhaps
not
she
replied
hesitatingly
i
have
never
thought
the
girl
continued
poutingly
that
you
did
anything
of
which
i
should
be
jealous
but
she
she
oh
i
hate
her
let
us
not
talk
about
her
jennie
faxton
told
me
i
will
talk
about
her
and
you
shall
not
stop
me
jennie
faxton
told
me
that
the
white
woman
made
love
to
you
and
caused
you
to
put
your
arm
about
her
waist
one
evening
on
the
battlements
jennie
told
you
a
lie
said
john
now
do
interrupt
me
the
girl
cried
nervously
almost
ready
for
tears
and
i
will
try
to
tell
you
all
jennie
told
me
the
the
white
woman
looked
up
to
you
this
fashion
and
the
languishing
look
she
gave
john
in
imitation
of
queen
mary
was
so
beautiful
and
comical
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
laugh
and
cover
her
face
with
kisses
then
laugh
again
and
love
the
girl
more
deeply
and
yet
more
deeply
with
each
new
breath
he
drew
dorothy
was
not
sure
whether
she
wanted
to
laugh
or
to
cry
so
she
did
both
jennie
told
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
continued
dorothy
when
all
things
seem
so
vivid
and
appear
so
distorted
and
and
that
terrible
blinding
jealousy
of
which
i
told
you
came
upon
me
and
drove
me
mad
i
really
thought
john
that
i
should
die
of
the
agony
oh
john
if
you
could
know
the
anguish
i
suffered
that
night
you
would
pity
me
you
would
not
blame
me
i
do
not
blame
you
dorothy
no
no
she
kissed
him
softly
and
quickly
continued
i
felt
that
i
must
separate
her
from
you
at
all
cost
i
would
have
done
murder
to
accomplish
my
purpose
some
demon
whispered
to
me
queen
elizabeth
and
and
oh
john
let
me
kneel
again
no
no
dorothy
let
us
talk
of
something
else
said
john
soothingly
in
one
moment
john
i
thought
only
of
the
evil
that
would
come
to
her
her
of
scotland
i
did
not
think
of
the
trouble
i
would
bring
to
you
john
until
the
queen
after
asking
me
if
you
were
my
lover
said
angrily
may
soon
seek
another
then
john
i
knew
that
i
had
also
brought
evil
upon
you
then
i
suffer
i
tried
to
reach
rutland
and
you
know
all
else
that
happened
on
that
terrible
night
now
john
you
know
all
all
i
have
withheld
nothing
i
have
confessed
all
and
i
feel
that
a
great
weight
is
taken
from
my
heart
you
will
not
hate
me
will
you
john
he
caught
the
girl
to
his
breast
and
tried
to
turn
her
face
toward
his
i
could
not
hate
you
if
i
would
he
replied
with
breath
and
god
knows
i
would
not
to
love
you
is
the
sweetest
joy
in
life
and
he
softly
kissed
the
great
lustrous
eyes
till
they
closed
as
if
in
sleep
then
he
fiercely
sought
the
rich
red
lips
waiting
soft
and
passive
for
his
caresses
while
the
fair
head
fell
back
upon
the
bend
of
his
elbow
in
a
languorous
sweet
surrender
to
his
will
lord
rutland
and
i
had
turned
our
backs
on
the
shameless
pair
and
were
busily
discussing
the
prospect
for
the
coming
season
crops
remember
please
that
dorothy
spoke
to
john
of
jennie
faxton
her
doing
so
soon
bore
bitter
fruit
for
me
dorothy
had
been
too
busy
with
john
to
notice
any
one
else
but
he
soon
presented
her
to
his
father
after
the
old
lord
had
gallantly
kissed
her
hand
she
turned
scornfully
to
me
and
said
so
you
fell
a
victim
to
her
wanton
wiles
if
it
were
not
for
sake
i
could
wish
you
might
hang
you
need
not
balk
your
kindly
desire
for
madge
sake
i
answered
she
cares
little
about
my
fate
i
fear
she
will
never
forgive
me
one
can
not
tell
what
a
woman
will
do
dorothy
replied
she
is
apt
to
make
a
great
fool
of
herself
when
it
comes
to
forgiving
the
man
she
loves
men
at
times
have
something
to
forgive
i
retorted
looking
with
a
smile
toward
john
the
girl
made
no
reply
but
took
john
hand
and
looked
at
him
as
if
to
say
john
please
do
let
this
horrid
man
abuse
me
but
madge
no
longer
cares
for
me
i
continued
wishing
to
talk
upon
the
theme
and
your
words
do
not
apply
to
her
the
girl
turned
her
back
disdainfully
on
me
and
said
you
seem
to
be
quite
as
easily
duped
by
the
woman
who
loves
you
and
says
she
does
as
by
the
one
who
does
not
care
for
you
but
says
she
does
damn
that
girl
tongue
thought
i
but
her
words
though
biting
carried
joy
to
my
heart
and
light
to
my
soul
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
lord
rutland
dorothy
turned
to
john
and
said
tell
me
upon
your
knightly
honor
john
do
you
know
aught
of
a
wicked
treasonable
plot
to
put
the
scottish
woman
on
the
english
throne
i
quickly
placed
my
finger
on
my
lips
and
touched
my
ear
to
indicate
that
their
words
would
be
overheard
for
a
connected
the
dungeon
with
sir
george
closet
before
the
holy
god
upon
my
knighthood
by
the
sacred
love
we
bear
each
other
i
swear
i
know
of
no
such
plot
answered
john
i
would
be
the
first
to
tell
our
good
queen
did
i
suspect
its
existence
dorothy
and
john
continued
talking
upon
the
subject
of
the
plot
but
were
soon
interrupted
by
a
warning
knock
upon
the
dungeon
door
lord
rutland
whose
heart
was
like
carat
gold
soft
pure
and
precious
kissed
dorothy
hand
when
she
was
about
to
leave
and
said
dear
lady
grieve
not
for
our
sake
i
can
easily
see
that
more
pain
has
come
to
you
than
to
us
i
thank
you
for
the
great
fearless
love
you
bear
my
son
it
has
brought
him
trouble
but
it
is
worth
its
cost
you
have
my
forgiveness
freely
and
i
pray
god
choicest
benediction
may
be
with
you
she
kissed
the
old
lord
and
said
i
hope
some
day
to
make
you
love
me
that
will
be
an
easy
task
said
his
lordship
gallantly
dorothy
was
about
to
leave
just
at
the
doorway
she
remembered
the
chief
purpose
of
her
visit
so
she
ran
back
to
john
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
to
insure
silence
and
whispered
in
his
ear
on
hearing
dorothy
whispered
words
signs
of
joy
were
so
apparent
in
john
face
that
they
could
not
be
mistaken
he
said
nothing
but
kissed
her
hand
and
she
hurriedly
left
the
dungeon
after
the
dungeon
door
closed
upon
dorothy
john
went
to
his
father
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
him
then
he
came
to
me
and
in
the
same
secretive
manner
said
the
queen
has
promised
dorothy
our
liberty
i
was
not
at
all
sure
that
our
liberty
included
me
i
greatly
doubted
it
but
i
was
glad
for
the
sake
of
my
friends
and
in
truth
cared
little
for
myself
dorothy
went
from
our
dungeon
to
the
queen
and
that
afternoon
according
to
promise
elizabeth
gave
orders
for
the
release
of
john
and
his
father
sir
george
of
course
was
greatly
chagrined
when
his
enemies
slipped
from
his
grasp
but
he
dared
not
show
his
ill
humor
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
nor
to
any
one
who
would
be
apt
to
enlighten
her
majesty
on
the
subject
dorothy
did
not
know
the
hour
when
her
lover
would
leave
haddon
but
she
sat
patiently
at
her
window
till
at
last
john
and
lord
rutland
appeared
she
called
to
madge
telling
her
of
the
joyous
event
and
madge
asked
is
malcolm
with
them
no
replied
dorothy
he
has
been
left
in
the
dungeon
where
he
deserves
to
remain
after
a
short
pause
madge
said
if
john
had
acted
toward
the
scottish
queen
as
malcolm
did
would
you
forgive
him
yes
of
course
i
would
forgive
him
anything
then
why
shall
we
not
forgive
malcolm
asked
madge
because
he
is
not
john
was
the
absurd
reply
no
said
madge
promptly
but
he
is
to
me
that
is
true
responded
dorothy
and
i
will
forgive
him
if
you
will
i
do
believe
it
makes
much
difference
to
malcolm
whether
or
not
you
forgive
him
said
madge
who
was
provoked
at
dorothy
condescending
offer
my
forgiveness
i
hope
is
what
he
desires
that
is
true
madge
replied
dorothy
laughingly
but
may
not
i
also
forgive
him
if
you
choose
responded
madge
quietly
as
for
me
i
know
not
what
i
wish
to
do
you
remember
that
dorothy
during
her
visit
to
the
dungeon
spoke
of
jennie
faxton
the
girl
name
reached
sir
george
ear
through
the
and
she
was
at
once
brought
in
and
put
to
the
question
jennie
contrary
to
her
wont
became
frightened
and
told
all
she
knew
concerning
john
and
dorothy
including
my
part
in
their
affairs
in
sir
george
mind
my
bad
faith
to
him
was
a
greater
crime
than
my
treason
to
elizabeth
and
he
at
once
went
to
the
queen
with
his
tale
of
woe
elizabeth
the
most
sentimental
of
women
had
heard
from
dorothy
the
story
of
her
tempestuous
love
and
also
of
mine
and
the
queen
was
greatly
interested
in
the
situation
i
will
try
to
be
brief
through
the
influence
of
dorothy
and
madge
as
i
afterward
learned
and
by
the
help
of
a
good
word
from
cecil
the
queen
was
induced
to
order
my
liberation
on
condition
that
i
should
thenceforth
reside
in
france
so
one
morning
three
days
after
john
departure
from
haddon
i
was
overjoyed
to
hear
the
words
you
are
free
i
did
not
know
that
jennie
faxton
had
given
sir
george
her
large
stock
of
disturbing
information
concerning
my
connection
with
the
affairs
of
dorothy
and
john
so
when
i
left
the
dungeon
i
supposing
that
my
stormy
cousin
would
be
glad
to
forgive
me
if
queen
elizabeth
would
sought
and
found
him
in
aunt
dorothy
room
lady
crawford
and
sir
george
were
sitting
near
the
fire
and
madge
was
standing
near
the
door
in
the
next
room
beyond
when
i
entered
sir
george
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
out
angrily
you
traitorous
dog
the
queen
has
seen
fit
to
liberate
you
and
i
can
not
interfere
with
her
orders
but
if
you
do
not
leave
my
hall
at
once
i
shall
set
the
hounds
on
you
your
effects
will
be
sent
to
the
peacock
and
the
sooner
you
quit
england
the
safer
you
will
be
there
was
of
course
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
go
you
once
told
me
sir
george
you
remember
our
interview
at
the
peacock
that
if
you
should
ever
again
order
me
to
leave
haddon
i
should
tell
you
to
go
to
the
devil
i
now
take
advantage
of
your
kind
permission
and
will
also
say
farewell
i
kissed
aunt
dorothy
cheek
took
my
leave
and
sought
cecil
from
whom
i
obtained
a
passport
to
france
then
i
asked
dawson
to
fetch
my
horse
i
longed
to
see
madge
before
i
left
haddon
but
i
knew
that
my
desire
could
not
be
gratified
so
i
determined
to
stop
at
rowsley
and
send
back
a
letter
to
her
which
dawson
undertook
to
deliver
in
my
letter
i
would
ask
madge
permission
to
return
for
her
from
france
and
to
take
her
home
with
me
as
my
wife
after
i
had
despatched
my
letter
i
would
wait
at
the
peacock
for
an
answer
sore
at
heart
i
bade
to
dawson
mounted
my
horse
and
turned
his
head
toward
the
gate
as
i
rode
under
dorothy
window
she
was
sitting
there
the
casement
was
open
for
the
day
was
mild
although
the
season
was
little
past
midwinter
i
heard
her
call
to
madge
and
then
she
called
to
me
farewell
malcolm
forgive
me
for
what
i
said
to
you
in
the
dungeon
i
was
wrong
as
usual
forgive
me
and
god
bless
you
farewell
while
dorothy
was
speaking
and
before
i
replied
madge
came
to
the
open
casement
and
called
wait
for
me
malcolm
i
am
going
down
to
you
great
joy
is
a
wonderful
purifier
and
madge
cry
finished
the
work
of
the
past
few
months
and
made
a
good
man
of
me
who
all
my
life
before
had
known
little
else
than
evil
soon
madge
horse
was
led
by
a
groom
to
the
mounting
block
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
emerged
gropingly
from
the
great
door
of
entrance
tower
dorothy
was
again
a
prisoner
in
her
rooms
and
could
not
come
down
to
bid
me
farewell
madge
mounted
and
the
groom
led
her
horse
to
me
and
placed
the
reins
in
my
hands
is
it
you
malcolm
asked
madge
yes
i
responded
in
a
voice
husky
with
emotion
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
coming
to
say
farewell
you
have
forgiven
me
yes
responded
madge
almost
in
tears
but
i
have
not
come
to
say
farewell
i
did
not
understand
her
meaning
are
you
going
to
ride
part
of
the
way
with
me
perhaps
to
rowsley
i
asked
hardly
daring
to
hope
for
so
much
to
france
malcolm
if
you
wish
to
take
me
she
responded
murmuringly
for
a
little
time
i
could
not
feel
the
happiness
that
had
come
upon
me
in
so
great
a
flood
but
when
i
had
collected
my
scattered
senses
i
said
i
thank
god
that
he
has
turned
your
heart
again
to
me
may
i
feel
his
righteous
anger
if
ever
i
give
you
cause
to
regret
the
step
you
are
taking
i
shall
never
regret
it
malcolm
she
answered
softly
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
then
we
rode
by
the
out
from
haddon
hall
never
to
see
its
walls
again
we
went
to
rutland
whence
after
a
fortnight
we
journeyed
to
france
there
i
received
my
mother
estates
and
never
for
one
moment
to
my
knowledge
has
madge
regretted
having
intrusted
her
life
and
happiness
to
me
i
need
not
speak
for
myself
our
home
is
among
the
warm
sunlit
hills
of
southern
france
and
we
care
not
for
the
joys
of
golden
streets
so
long
as
god
in
his
goodness
vouchsafes
to
us
our
earthly
paradise
age
with
the
heart
at
peace
is
the
fairest
season
of
life
and
love
leavened
of
god
robs
even
approaching
death
of
his
sting
and
makes
for
us
a
broad
path
from
the
tempestuous
sea
of
time
to
the
calm
sweet
ocean
of
eternity
chapter
xvi
leicester
waits
at
the
stile
i
shall
now
tell
you
of
the
happenings
in
haddon
hall
during
the
fortnight
we
spent
at
rutland
before
our
departure
for
france
we
left
dorothy
you
will
remember
a
prisoner
in
her
rooms
after
john
had
gone
sir
george
wrath
began
to
gather
and
dorothy
was
not
permitted
to
depart
from
the
hall
for
even
a
walk
upon
the
terrace
nor
could
she
leave
her
own
apartments
save
when
the
queen
requested
her
presence
a
few
days
after
my
departure
from
haddon
sir
george
sent
dawson
out
through
the
adjoining
country
to
invite
the
nobility
and
gentry
to
a
grand
ball
to
be
given
at
the
hall
in
honor
of
queen
elizabeth
queen
mary
had
been
sent
a
prisoner
to
chatsworth
tom
shaw
the
most
famous
piper
of
his
times
and
a
choice
company
of
musicians
to
play
with
him
were
hired
for
the
occasion
and
in
short
the
event
was
so
glorious
that
its
wonders
have
been
sung
in
minstrelsy
throughout
derbyshire
ever
since
dorothy
imprisonment
saddened
leicester
heart
and
he
longed
to
see
her
for
her
beauty
had
touched
him
nearly
accordingly
the
earl
one
day
intimated
to
sir
george
his
wish
in
terms
that
almost
bespoke
an
intention
to
ask
for
the
girl
hand
when
upon
proper
opportunity
the
consent
might
be
sought
and
perchance
obtained
his
equivocal
words
did
not
induce
sir
george
to
grant
a
meeting
by
which
dorothy
might
be
compromised
but
a
robust
hope
for
the
ultimate
accomplishment
of
the
leicester
possibility
was
aroused
in
the
breast
of
the
king
of
the
peak
and
from
hope
he
could
and
soon
did
easily
step
to
faith
he
saw
that
the
earl
was
a
handsome
man
and
he
believed
at
least
he
hoped
that
the
fascinating
lord
might
if
he
were
given
an
opportunity
woo
heart
away
from
the
hated
scion
of
a
hated
race
sir
george
therefore
after
several
interviews
with
the
earl
grew
anxious
to
give
his
lordship
an
opportunity
to
win
her
but
both
sir
george
and
my
lord
feared
elizabeth
displeasure
and
the
meeting
between
leicester
and
the
girl
seemed
difficult
to
contrive
sir
george
felt
confident
that
dorothy
could
if
she
would
easily
capture
the
great
lord
in
a
few
private
interviews
but
would
she
dorothy
gave
her
father
no
encouragement
in
the
matter
and
took
pains
to
shun
leicester
rather
than
to
seek
him
as
dorothy
grew
unwilling
leicester
and
sir
george
grew
eager
until
at
length
the
latter
felt
that
it
was
almost
time
to
exert
his
parental
authority
he
told
aunt
dorothy
his
feeling
on
the
subject
and
she
told
her
niece
it
was
impossible
to
know
from
what
source
dorothy
might
draw
inspiration
for
mischief
it
came
to
her
with
her
father
regarding
leicester
winter
had
again
asserted
itself
the
weather
was
bitter
cold
and
snow
covered
the
ground
to
the
depth
of
a
horse
fetlock
the
eventful
night
of
the
grand
ball
arrived
and
dorothy
heart
throbbed
till
she
thought
surely
it
would
burst
at
nightfall
guests
began
to
arrive
and
sir
george
hospitable
soul
that
he
was
grew
boisterous
with
good
humor
and
delight
the
rare
old
battlements
of
haddon
were
ablaze
with
flambeaux
and
inside
the
rooms
were
alight
with
waxen
tapers
the
long
gallery
was
brilliant
with
the
smiles
of
bejewelled
beauty
and
laughter
song
and
merriment
filled
the
grand
old
hall
from
terrace
to
entrance
tower
dorothy
of
course
was
brought
down
from
her
prison
to
grace
the
occasion
with
a
beauty
which
none
could
rival
her
garments
were
of
soft
clinging
silks
and
snowy
laces
and
all
who
saw
her
agreed
that
a
creature
more
radiant
never
greeted
the
eye
of
man
when
the
guests
had
all
arrived
the
pipers
in
the
balcony
burst
forth
in
strains
of
music
and
every
foot
in
the
room
longed
for
the
dance
to
begin
i
should
like
to
tell
you
how
elizabeth
most
graciously
opened
the
ball
with
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
peak
amid
the
plaudits
of
worshipping
subjects
and
i
should
enjoy
describing
the
riotous
glory
which
followed
for
although
i
was
not
there
i
know
intimately
all
that
happened
but
i
will
balk
my
desire
and
tell
you
only
of
those
things
which
touched
dorothy
leicester
of
course
danced
with
her
and
during
a
pause
in
the
figure
the
girl
in
response
to
pleadings
which
she
had
adroitly
incited
reluctantly
promised
to
grant
the
earl
the
private
interview
he
so
much
desired
if
he
could
suggest
some
means
for
bringing
it
about
leicester
was
in
raptures
over
her
complaisance
and
glowed
with
triumph
and
delightful
anticipation
but
he
could
think
of
no
satisfactory
plan
whereby
his
hopes
might
be
brought
to
a
happy
fruition
he
proposed
several
but
all
seemed
impracticable
to
the
coy
girl
and
she
rejected
them
after
many
futile
attempts
he
said
i
can
suggest
no
good
plan
mistress
i
pray
you
gracious
lady
therefore
make
full
to
overflowing
the
measure
of
your
generosity
and
tell
me
how
it
may
be
accomplished
dorothy
hung
her
head
as
if
in
great
shame
and
said
i
fear
my
lord
we
had
better
abandon
the
project
for
a
time
upon
another
occasion
perhaps
no
no
interrupted
the
earl
pleadingly
do
not
so
grievously
disappoint
me
my
heart
yearns
to
have
you
to
myself
for
one
little
moment
where
spying
eyes
can
not
see
nor
prying
ears
hear
it
is
cruel
in
you
to
raise
my
hopes
only
to
cast
them
down
i
beg
you
tell
me
if
you
know
in
what
manner
i
may
meet
you
privately
after
a
long
pause
dorothy
with
downcast
eyes
said
i
am
full
of
shame
my
lord
to
consent
to
this
meeting
and
then
find
the
way
to
it
but
but
yes
yes
my
venus
my
gracious
one
interrupted
the
earl
but
if
my
father
would
permit
me
to
to
leave
the
hall
for
a
few
minutes
i
might
oh
it
is
impossible
my
lord
i
must
not
think
of
it
i
pray
you
i
beg
you
pleaded
leicester
tell
me
at
least
what
you
might
do
if
your
father
would
permit
you
to
leave
the
hall
i
would
gladly
fall
to
my
knees
were
it
not
for
the
assembled
company
with
reluctance
in
her
manner
and
gladness
in
her
heart
the
girl
said
if
my
father
would
permit
me
to
leave
the
hall
i
might
only
for
a
moment
meet
you
at
the
stile
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
garden
back
of
the
terrace
half
an
hour
hence
but
he
would
not
permit
me
and
and
my
lord
i
ought
not
to
go
even
should
father
consent
i
will
ask
your
father
permission
for
you
i
will
seek
him
at
once
said
the
eager
earl
no
no
my
lord
i
pray
you
do
not
murmured
dorothy
with
distracting
little
troubled
wrinkles
in
her
forehead
her
trouble
was
more
for
fear
lest
he
would
not
than
for
dread
that
he
would
i
will
i
will
cried
his
lordship
softly
i
insist
and
you
shall
not
gainsay
me
the
girl
only
assent
was
silence
but
that
was
sufficient
for
so
enterprising
a
gallant
as
the
noble
robert
dudley
earl
of
leicester
so
he
at
once
went
to
seek
sir
george
the
old
gentleman
although
anxious
to
give
leicester
a
chance
to
press
his
suit
with
dorothy
at
first
refused
but
leicester
said
my
intentions
are
honorable
sir
george
if
i
can
win
your
heart
it
is
my
wish
if
the
queen
consent
can
be
obtained
to
ask
mistress
vernon
hand
in
marriage
sir
george
breast
swelled
with
pride
and
satisfaction
for
words
were
as
near
an
offer
of
marriage
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
make
so
the
earl
received
for
dorothy
permission
to
leave
the
hall
and
eagerly
carried
it
to
her
your
father
consents
gladly
said
the
earl
will
you
meet
me
half
an
hour
hence
at
the
stile
yes
murmured
the
girl
with
shamelessly
cast
down
eyes
and
drooping
head
leicester
bowed
himself
away
and
fully
fifteen
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
left
the
hall
to
wait
in
the
cold
at
the
stile
for
dorothy
before
the
expiration
of
the
tedious
half
hour
our
meek
maiden
went
to
her
father
and
with
deep
modesty
and
affected
shame
said
father
is
it
your
wish
that
i
go
out
of
the
hall
for
a
few
minutes
to
meet
to
meet
she
apparently
could
not
finish
the
sentence
so
modest
and
was
she
yes
doll
i
wish
you
to
go
on
this
condition
if
leicester
asks
you
to
marry
him
you
shall
consent
to
be
his
wife
i
promise
father
replied
the
dutiful
girl
if
lord
leicester
asks
me
this
night
i
will
be
his
wife
that
is
well
child
that
is
well
once
more
you
are
my
good
obedient
daughter
and
i
love
you
wear
your
sable
cloak
doll
the
weather
is
very
cold
out
of
doors
her
father
solicitude
touched
her
nearly
and
she
gently
led
him
to
a
secluded
alcove
near
by
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
passionately
the
girl
affection
was
sweet
to
the
old
man
who
had
been
without
it
so
long
and
his
eyes
grew
moist
as
he
returned
her
caresses
dorothy
eyes
also
were
filled
with
tears
her
throat
was
choked
with
sobs
and
her
heart
was
sore
with
pain
poor
young
heart
poor
old
man
soon
after
dorothy
had
spoken
with
her
father
she
left
the
hall
by
dorothy
postern
she
was
wrapped
in
her
sable
cloak
the
one
that
had
saved
john
life
in
aunt
dorothy
room
but
instead
of
going
across
the
garden
to
the
stile
where
lord
leicester
was
waiting
which
was
north
and
east
of
the
terrace
she
sped
southward
down
the
terrace
and
did
not
stop
till
she
reached
the
steps
which
led
westward
to
the
lower
garden
she
stood
on
the
terrace
till
she
saw
a
man
running
toward
her
from
the
postern
in
the
southwest
corner
of
the
lower
garden
then
down
the
steps
she
sped
with
winged
feet
and
outstretching
her
arms
fell
upon
the
breast
whispering
john
my
love
john
my
love
as
for
the
man
well
during
the
first
minute
or
two
he
wasted
no
time
in
speech
when
he
spoke
he
said
we
must
not
tarry
here
horses
are
waiting
at
the
south
end
of
the
footbridge
let
us
hasten
away
at
once
then
happened
the
strangest
of
all
the
strange
things
i
have
had
to
record
of
this
strange
fierce
tender
and
at
time
almost
girl
dorothy
for
months
had
longed
for
that
moment
her
heart
had
almost
burst
with
joy
when
a
hope
for
it
was
suggested
by
the
opportunities
of
the
ball
and
her
father
desire
touching
my
lord
of
leicester
but
now
that
the
moment
was
at
hand
the
tender
heart
which
had
so
anxiously
awaited
it
failed
and
the
girl
broke
down
weeping
hysterically
oh
john
you
have
forgiven
so
many
faults
in
me
she
said
between
sobs
that
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
when
i
tell
you
i
can
not
go
with
you
i
thought
i
could
and
i
so
intended
when
i
came
out
here
to
meet
you
but
oh
john
my
dearest
love
i
can
not
go
i
can
not
go
another
time
i
will
go
with
you
john
i
promise
that
i
will
go
with
you
soon
very
soon
john
but
i
can
not
go
now
oh
i
can
not
you
will
forgive
me
wo
you
john
you
will
forgive
me
no
cried
john
in
no
uncertain
tones
i
will
not
forgive
you
i
will
take
you
if
you
cry
out
i
will
silence
you
thereupon
he
rudely
took
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
ran
with
her
toward
the
garden
gate
near
the
north
end
of
the
stone
footbridge
john
john
she
cried
in
terror
but
he
placed
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
forced
her
to
remain
silent
till
they
were
past
the
south
wall
then
he
removed
his
hand
and
she
screamed
and
struggled
against
him
with
all
her
might
strong
as
she
was
her
strength
was
no
match
for
john
and
her
struggles
were
in
vain
john
with
his
stolen
bride
hurriedly
crossed
the
footbridge
and
ran
to
the
men
who
were
holding
the
horses
there
he
placed
dorothy
on
her
feet
and
said
with
a
touch
of
anger
will
you
mount
of
your
own
will
or
shall
i
put
you
in
the
saddle
i
mount
of
my
own
will
john
she
replied
submissively
and
john
i
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
for
for
she
stopped
speaking
and
toyed
with
the
tufts
of
fur
that
hung
from
the
edges
of
her
cloak
for
what
my
love
for
what
do
you
thank
me
asked
john
after
a
little
pause
for
making
me
do
what
i
i
longed
to
do
my
conscience
would
not
let
me
do
it
of
my
own
free
will
then
tears
came
from
her
eyes
in
a
great
flood
and
throwing
her
arms
about
john
neck
she
gave
him
herself
and
her
heart
to
keep
forever
and
forever
and
leicester
was
shivering
at
the
stile
the
girl
had
forgotten
even
the
existence
of
the
greatest
lord
in
the
realm
my
wife
lord
rutland
and
i
waited
in
the
above
the
castle
gates
for
the
coming
of
dorothy
and
john
and
when
they
came
but
i
will
not
try
to
describe
the
scene
it
were
a
vain
effort
tears
and
laughter
well
compounded
make
the
sweetest
joy
grief
and
joy
the
truest
happiness
happiness
and
pain
the
grandest
soul
and
none
of
these
may
be
described
we
may
analyze
them
and
may
take
them
part
from
part
but
like
love
they
can
not
be
compounded
we
may
know
all
the
component
parts
but
when
we
try
to
create
these
great
emotions
in
description
we
lack
the
subtle
compounding
flux
to
unite
the
ingredients
and
after
all
is
done
we
have
simply
said
that
black
is
black
and
that
white
is
white
next
day
in
the
morning
madge
and
i
started
for
our
new
home
in
france
we
rode
up
the
hill
down
which
poor
dolcy
took
her
last
fatal
plunge
and
when
we
reached
the
crest
we
paused
to
look
back
standing
on
the
battlements
waving
a
kerchief
in
farewell
to
us
was
the
form
of
a
girl
soon
she
covered
her
face
with
her
kerchief
and
we
knew
she
was
weeping
then
we
also
wept
as
we
turned
away
from
the
fair
picture
and
since
that
morning
forty
long
long
years
ago
we
have
not
seen
the
face
nor
heard
the
voice
of
our
sweet
tender
friend
forty
years
what
an
eternity
it
is
if
we
tear
it
into
minutes
the
fire
ceases
to
burn
the
flames
are
sucked
back
into
the
earth
the
doe
blood
has
boiled
away
the
caldron
cools
and
my
shadowy
friends
so
real
to
me
whom
i
love
with
a
passionate
tenderness
beyond
my
power
to
express
have
sunk
into
the
dread
black
bank
of
the
past
and
my
poor
weak
wand
is
powerless
to
recall
them
for
the
space
of
even
one
fleeting
moment
so
i
must
say
farewell
to
them
but
all
my
life
i
shall
carry
a
heart
full
of
tender
love
and
pain
for
the
fairest
fiercest
gentlest
weakest
strongest
of
them
all
dorothy
vernon
malcolm
possibly
in
error
malcolm
vernon
is
the
only
writer
on
the
life
of
dorothy
vernon
who
speaks
of
rutland
castle
all
others
writing
on
the
subject
say
that
belvoir
castle
was
the
home
of
the
earl
of
rutland
no
other
writer
mentions
the
proposed
marriage
spoken
of
by
malcolm
between
dorothy
and
lord
derby
son
they
do
however
say
that
dorothy
had
an
elder
sister
who
married
a
stanley
but
died
childless
leaving
dorothy
sole
heiress
to
sir
george
vernon
vast
estate
all
writers
agree
with
malcolm
upon
the
main
fact
that
brave
dorothy
eloped
with
john
manners
and
brought
to
him
the
fair
estate
of
haddon
which
their
descendant
the
present
duke
of
rutland
now
possesses
no
other
writer
speaks
of
mary
stuart
having
been
at
haddon
and
many
chroniclers
disagree
with
malcolm
as
to
the
exact
date
of
her
imprisonment
in
lochleven
and
her
escape
in
all
other
essential
respects
the
history
of
dorothy
vernon
as
told
by
malcolm
agrees
with
other
accounts
of
her
life
i
do
not
pretend
to
reconcile
the
differences
between
these
great
historical
authorities
but
i
confess
to
considerable
faith
in
malcolm
